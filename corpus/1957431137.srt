00:32:59,119 --> 00:33:00,987
Well, if you did it,
for sure.

534
00:33:08,596 --> 00:33:10,932
Okay. All right.

535
00:33:10,997 --> 00:33:12,999
Seriously?

536
00:33:13,066 --> 00:33:15,135
You're gonna base
your decision on a hunch?

537
00:33:15,202 --> 00:33:17,337
My orders are to get him
out of here alive, okay?

538
00:33:17,404 --> 00:33:18,972
Not in a fucking body bag.

539
00:33:19,039 --> 00:33:21,843
Only thing I need you to do
is get the comms back online.

540
00:33:21,909 --> 00:33:23,243
Sooner you can do that,

541
00:33:23,310 --> 00:33:24,579
sooner we can all get
the fuck out of here.

542
00:33:24,645 --> 00:33:25,813
What are you doing?
What are you doing?

543
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:26,914
He is the high-profile
target,

544
00:33:26,980 --> 00:33:28,749
not me, okay?

545
00:33:28,816 --> 00:33:32,553
Wait. Just wait.

546
00:33:32,620 --> 00:33:33,987
I'll do it.

547
00:33:40,026 --> 00:33:44,765
If you try anything,
I swear to God...

548
00:33:44,832 --> 00:33:46,934
you'll regret it.

549
00:33:47,000 --> 00:33:48,468
She's wrong, you know.

550
00:33:48,536 --> 00:33:51,271
I'm not who she says I am.
I'm telling you she's wrong.

551
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:57,344
He does anything
out of line, you shoot him.

552
00:34:03,918 --> 00:34:06,587
A few down here.

553
00:34:06,654 --> 00:34:08,556
They go up
around the corner there.

554
00:34:08,623 --> 00:34:10,591
Ten, maybe five.

555
00:34:13,728 --> 00:34:15,428
They're gonna come after us
sooner or later.

556
00:34:15,496 --> 00:34:18,431
Grenades. RPGs.
We're exposed here.

557
00:34:21,234 --> 00:34:23,136
Just gotta keep 'em
suppressed.

558
00:34:23,203 --> 00:34:26,139
We ain't losing any more people
here today.

559
00:34:26,206 --> 00:34:28,876

- Negative.

560

561
00:34:32,980 --> 00:34:34,916

Ash gone.

someone's sticking needles

567

Never leave home without it.

Don't shoot!
Please, don't shoot.

570
00:34:56,837 --> 00:35:00,307
They want you to surrender.

571
00:35:00,373 --> 00:35:02,242
They'll let you live
if you put down your weapons.

572

They're not here for you.

573
00:35:03,711 --> 00:35:06,514
Rules of engagement.
Give him a warning.

574
00:35:06,581 --> 00:35:08,916
Do not take
another step forward.

575
00:35:08,983 --> 00:35:11,384
This is your only warning.

576
00:35:11,451 --> 00:35:13,453

You got blood in your eye,

You fucking frog man.
Let's go.

I know.

613
00:37:54,482 --> 00:37:57,518
Hey, I'm gonna need you
to come up with a new plan.

614
00:37:57,585 --> 00:37:58,819
You're not gonna be able
to hold this line.

615
00:37:58,886 --> 00:38:00,420
Get back inside!
Get away from the doorway.

616
00:38:00,488 --> 00:38:01,722
Lieutenant,
I'm gonna give him up.

617
00:38:01,789 --> 00:38:03,057
I'm gonna give him up
right now.

618
00:38:03,124 --> 00:38:04,058
- Fuck.
- No, you're not.

619
00:38:04,125 --> 00:38:05,358
Get out of the way.

620
00:38:05,425 --> 00:38:06,927
We're not
giving him to them.

621
00:38:06,994 --> 00:38:09,530
The only thing I care about
right now is staying alive.

622
00:38:09,597 --> 00:38:11,198
If they want him,
then let them have him.

623
00:38:11,264 --> 00:38:13,634
- You are scared. We all are.
- Okay, right, I'm scared.

624
00:38:13,701 --> 00:38:15,069
Those guys took out everyone.

625
00:38:15,136 --> 00:38:16,369
All the marines, all the PMCs.

626
00:38:16,436 --> 00:38:17,370
Next, they're
gonna come in here,

627
00:38:17,437 --> 00:38:18,739
they're gonna take us down too,

628
00:38:18,806 --> 00:38:20,975
and there's nothing these
SEALS can do to stop them.

629
00:38:21,041 --> 00:38:22,977
You understand that, right?

630
00:38:23,043 --> 00:38:27,581
- Hey, my men can hold them.
- For how long?

631
00:38:27,648 --> 00:38:29,517
We give him give up.
We save ourselves.

632
00:38:29,583 --> 00:38:31,719
That is not happening.
Look, I need him.

633
00:38:31,786 --> 00:38:33,353
I am telling you
I am not a terrorist.

634

What if he dies
before you can get him out?

637
00:38:37,323 --> 00:38:38,492
The whole base is under attack.

638
00:38:38,559 --> 00:38:39,693

any questions

in the crossfire.

640
00:38:41,162 --> 00:38:42,295
We throw his body out there.

641
00:38:42,362 --> 00:38:44,031
Maybe they'll pack up
and go home.

642
00:38:44,098 --> 00:38:45,766
- Calm down.
- I am calm. I am calm!

643
00:38:45,833 --> 00:38:48,569
Listen, one bullet and this
is all over, clean and easy.

644
00:38:48,636 --> 00:38:49,837

than it is to take one.

646

supposed to mean?

647
00:38:54,508 --> 00:38:56,811
Shields, just
calm down, okay?

648
00:38:56,877 --> 00:38:59,647
Calm down.

649
00:38:59,713 --> 00:39:02,917
Hey, what are you doing?
What are you doing? Shields.

650
00:39:02,983 --> 00:39:05,820
Listen to me. Listen to me.
He is the problem.

651
00:39:05,886 --> 00:39:07,621
We throw him out there.
This all goes away.

652
00:39:07,688 --> 00:39:09,990

the HBT out of here alive!

666
00:39:52,867 --> 00:39:56,971
an Imam I had never met
before came to my house.

667
00:39:57,037 --> 00:39:59,807
He told me he'd heard
about my son.

668
00:39:59,874 --> 00:40:02,610

- Radicals.

- And you let them?
- Yes, I did.

00:56:55,823 --> 00:56:59,159
The reward of the hereafter
is the greatest reward of all.

890
00:57:17,144 --> 00:57:20,881

892
00:57:32,660 --> 00:57:35,129
Get those men out of the way.

[shouting in native language]

894
00:57:46,472 --> 00:57:48,409

[all shouting
"Ademar! Ademar!"]

896
00:58:18,572 --> 00:58:22,242
You promise
to serve our fight.

897
00:58:35,255 --> 00:58:38,192
Swallow it.

898
00:58:50,537 --> 00:58:52,840
It's time.

899
00:58:52,906 --> 00:58:54,541
Let's go.

900
00:58:54,608 --> 00:58:57,978
Move.

901
00:58:58,045 --> 00:58:59,580
Secure the exit.

902
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:01,849
[indistinct].

903
00:59:01,915 --> 00:59:04,251
I want two men up here
and two men [indistinct].

904
00:59:04,318 --> 00:59:07,254
Everybody move! Move!

905
00:59:19,600 --> 00:59:24,071
Wait. Make sure
everything is ready.

906
00:59:24,138 --> 00:59:26,707
Out of my way.

907
00:59:26,774 --> 00:59:30,878
Do not let go
until very close.

908
00:59:51,899 --> 00:59:53,867
[inaudible] no pain.

909
00:59:53,934 --> 00:59:56,303
There's nothing to fear.

910
00:59:56,370 --> 00:59:59,306
Go on.

911
01:00:19,293 --> 01:00:22,196
[rapid gunfire]

912
01:00:25,632 --> 01:00:27,569
Is there another way in?

913
01:00:27,634 --> 01:00:29,603
Make way. Go on.

914
01:00:29,670 --> 01:00:30,838
Make a path.

915
01:00:30,904 --> 01:00:34,641

[rapid gunfire]

917
01:00:35,876 --> 01:00:38,078
Okay, stop.

918
01:00:38,145 --> 01:00:41,982
Right here.

919
01:00:42,049 --> 01:00:46,253
Stop.

920
01:00:46,320 --> 01:00:47,754
What are you doing?

921
01:00:47,821 --> 01:00:51,792
And you, here.
Come on, guys. Focus.

922
01:00:51,859 --> 01:00:53,026
[rapid gunfire]

923
01:00:53,093 --> 01:00:56,730
Get me [inaudible]

924
01:00:56,797 --> 01:00:58,632
[all speaking indistinctly]

925
01:00:58,699 --> 01:01:01,235
- You ready now?
- Come on.

926
01:01:05,839 --> 01:01:08,942
[shouts indistinctly]

927
01:01:15,749 --> 01:01:18,185
Oh, fuck I hate flashbangs.

928
01:01:18,252 --> 01:01:21,321
And you can't see shit
through the smoke.

929
01:01:31,865 --> 01:01:36,803
Last mag.

930
01:01:36,870 --> 01:01:38,205
You know they're gonna
charge us, right?

931
01:01:38,272 --> 01:01:40,674
- Yeah.
- Right down the middle.

932
01:01:40,741 --> 01:01:41,808
They're gonna come after us.

933
01:01:41,875 --> 01:01:44,845
Yeah, well,
we can handle it.

934
01:01:44,912 --> 01:01:47,114
Yeah, we can handle it.

935
01:01:47,181 --> 01:01:51,151
We just got to be ready,
because they're gonna come

936
01:01:51,218 --> 01:01:53,053
right down the fuckin' middle.

937
01:01:53,120 --> 01:01:56,524
Danny,
hold it together.

938
01:01:56,591 --> 01:01:59,494
We got this. We gonna
get you home to your mama.

939
01:01:59,561 --> 01:02:03,297
I'ma get home to Tia.
Come on. You with me?

940
01:02:03,363 --> 01:02:07,801
Booyah.

941
01:02:07,868 --> 01:02:09,870
<i>Hey, boys. Daddy's home.</i>

942
01:02:09,937 --> 01:02:12,239
Roger. Jake's back.

943
01:02:12,306 --> 01:02:16,476
Copy that.

944
01:02:16,544 --> 01:02:19,213
He made it.

945
01:02:19,279 --> 01:02:21,114
Air support is
30 minutes out.

946
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:25,052
30 minutes? Fuck.
It's gonna be tight.

947
01:02:25,118 --> 01:02:27,955
Heard them talking.
It's like you said.

948
01:02:28,021 --> 01:02:30,324
They are here for him.

949
01:02:30,390 --> 01:02:32,759
Well, maybe it's time to
find out what he really knows.

950
01:02:32,826 --> 01:02:33,961
He tells us
where that bomb is,

951
01:02:34,027 --> 01:02:35,362
we can radio it in.

952
01:02:35,429 --> 01:02:36,863
You had ten days to break
him, and you got nothing.

953
01:02:36,930 --> 01:02:38,198
That's not gonna change
in 30 minutes.

954
01:02:38,265 --> 01:02:40,200
I lost a lot of people today
because of this bastard.

955
01:02:40,267 --> 01:02:41,969
And hurting him is not
gonna bring them back.

956
01:02:42,035 --> 01:02:43,203
Oh, I don't wanna hurt him.

957
01:02:43,270 --> 01:02:45,707
I want to end him,
and so do you.

958
01:02:45,772 --> 01:02:48,242
I can see it in your eyes.

959
01:02:48,308 --> 01:02:49,943
[loud explosion]

960
01:02:50,010 --> 01:02:51,144
- No! No!
- Talk!

961
01:02:51,211 --> 01:02:52,480
I don't know anything
about...

962
01:02:52,547 --> 01:02:54,147
George, this is not the way
to get answers.

963
01:02:54,214 --> 01:02:56,750
George,
this is not the way.

964
01:02:56,817 --> 01:02:57,985
I am tired of your
bleeding heart crap.

965
01:02:58,051 --> 01:02:59,353
It is not about what's right.

966
01:02:59,419 --> 01:03:01,355
It's about what works,
and this is not it.

967
01:03:01,421 --> 01:03:05,792
I moved money for them.
[indistinct].

968
01:03:05,859 --> 01:03:08,061
No! No! Ahh!

969
01:03:08,128 --> 01:03:10,097
- I cannot get answers...
- Get back. Stay away from me.

970
01:03:10,163 --> 01:03:11,431
Jeff, listen to me.

971
01:03:11,499 --> 01:03:14,101
I need him in D.C.
to get answers.

972
01:03:14,167 --> 01:03:17,170
Look, that's enough.
Let him go. Let him go.

973
01:03:17,237 --> 01:03:20,140
Harris, Harris, this guy is
the reason your buddy's dead.

974
01:03:20,207 --> 01:03:21,341
He is the reason
for everything.

975
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:23,010
Everything
that's happened today.

976
01:03:23,076 --> 01:03:27,147
- Grab his head.
- No. No.

977
01:03:27,214 --> 01:03:29,816
You ever read the Bible?

978
01:03:29,883 --> 01:03:31,418
You ever here about
an eye for an eye?

979
01:03:31,486 --> 01:03:33,621
No! No! Ahh!

980
01:03:33,688 --> 01:03:35,355
Why are these...

981
01:03:35,422 --> 01:03:37,492
No, look,
he is under my custody,

982
01:03:37,558 --> 01:03:39,092
and he leaves here alive.

983
01:03:39,159 --> 01:03:40,861
Yeah, you have paperwork
that says that?

984
01:03:40,927 --> 01:03:42,329
That's enough.

985
01:03:42,396 --> 01:03:44,499
This isn't the way
to get answers.

986
01:03:44,565 --> 01:03:48,068
Yeah, watch this.

987
01:03:48,135 --> 01:03:50,203
My son is already dead.

988
01:03:50,270 --> 01:03:53,040
There is nothing
more that you can do to me.

989
01:03:53,106 --> 01:03:56,476
You lost a son.
I lost a wife.

990
01:03:56,544 --> 01:03:59,747
And I promised
I'd make you bastards pay.

991
01:03:59,813 --> 01:04:01,415
So did I.

992
01:04:01,482 --> 01:04:04,151
[loud explosion]

993
01:04:04,217 --> 01:04:05,787
Yorke, get up here.

994
01:04:05,852 --> 01:04:07,789
Quick, push up. Moving.

995
01:04:07,854 --> 01:04:10,991

998
01:04:21,602 --> 01:04:23,671
I'm down to my last ten.

1002

They brought their game.

[rapid gunfire]

1004
01:04:37,552 --> 01:04:39,386
Bulletproof.

Aim for the legs.

[indistinct].

1007
01:04:48,563 --> 01:04:50,364
Johnny's hit.

1008
01:04:50,430 --> 01:04:53,835
Go!
Let me see. Let me see.

1009
01:04:53,934 --> 01:04:55,837

1010
01:04:55,902 --> 01:04:58,038
[indistinct], get over here!

1012
01:05:02,777 --> 01:05:04,978
I got you, man.

1013
01:05:05,045 --> 01:05:08,516
Look at me.
I got you. You're okay. Okay?

1014
01:05:08,583 --> 01:05:09,784
You're okay.

Hey. Hey. Hey.

I'm the only chance
you have of getting off

1037
01:09:06,219 --> 01:09:09,523
this island alive.
You understand that?

1038
01:09:09,590 --> 01:09:13,494
You think these people
give a shit about you?

1039
01:09:13,561 --> 01:09:16,864
I'll take my chances.

1040

I got you.
Okay.

01:09:47,595 --> 01:09:52,232
Just relax.
You're gonna be okay.

Don't move. Zoe. Zoe. Zoe.

1048

Don't move.

1049
01:09:58,739 --> 01:10:00,941
Your baby.

1050
01:10:01,008 --> 01:10:04,344
I know, I know. I'm gonna get
you out of here, okay?

1051
01:10:04,411 --> 01:10:07,114
I'm gonna get you
both out of here, okay?

1052
01:10:07,180 --> 01:10:11,351
It's not mine.

1053
01:10:11,418 --> 01:10:17,257
His wife
is 16 weeks pregnant.

1054
01:10:17,323 --> 01:10:19,060
It's a boy.

1055
01:10:19,126 --> 01:10:20,528
What?

1056
01:10:20,594 --> 01:10:23,931
She's in the blast zone.

1057
01:10:23,998 --> 01:10:25,833
Mansur's wife?

1058
01:10:25,900 --> 01:10:31,572
You... you have to get him
to D.C.

1059
01:10:31,639 --> 01:10:35,776
He won't believe it unless
he sees it with his eyes.

01:12:18,813 --> 01:12:20,748
He escaped.

1071
01:12:20,815 --> 01:12:22,082
Follow him.

1072
01:12:22,149 --> 01:12:25,085
[groaning]

1073
01:12:39,567 --> 01:12:42,169
What do you Mansur
tell you?

1074
01:12:42,236 --> 01:12:49,143
What did he tell you?

1075
01:12:49,210 --> 01:12:53,214
Everything.

1076
01:12:53,280 --> 01:12:56,416
[gunshots]

1077
01:13:00,287 --> 01:13:04,625
[speaking in native language]

1078
01:13:04,692 --> 01:13:08,729
Find me that bastard,
and alive.

1079
01:13:12,967 --> 01:13:16,570
Shit!

1080
01:13:16,637 --> 01:13:19,707
[speaking in native language]

1081
01:13:28,414 --> 01:13:30,284
[gunshots]

1082
01:13:30,351 --> 01:13:33,419
[speaking in native language]

1083
01:13:38,391 --> 01:13:40,361
This is a complete mess.

1084
01:13:40,426 --> 01:13:46,634
Next time we get more money.

1085
01:13:46,700 --> 01:13:48,535
All this vision bullshit.

1086
01:13:48,602 --> 01:13:51,605
[indistinct].

1087
01:13:51,672 --> 01:13:54,742
[speaking in native language]

1088
01:14:02,016 --> 01:14:06,520
- [speaking in native language]
- [speaking in native language]

1089
01:14:06,587 --> 01:14:08,989
Karim,
[indistinct].

1090
01:14:09,056 --> 01:14:14,427
The Americans are sending
air support.

1091
01:14:14,495 --> 01:14:21,535
You find and you destroy
those that are protecting him.

1092
01:14:21,602 --> 01:14:24,838
Don't disappoint me.

1093
01:14:24,905 --> 01:14:29,109
Nobody leaves this island.
Nobody.

1094
01:14:32,613 --> 01:14:33,714
[inaudible].

1095
01:14:33,781 --> 01:14:36,083
Shortly he will head
for the dock.

1096
01:14:36,150 --> 01:14:39,053
Maybe or maybe
he will stay hiding.

1097
01:14:39,119 --> 01:14:42,222
Get a man with you
and protect those doors.

1098
01:14:42,289 --> 01:14:46,961
Come on, guys.

1099
01:14:47,027 --> 01:14:48,796
Get [indistinct]. Tell him I
don't want no witnesses.

1100
01:14:48,862 --> 01:14:49,930
[speaking in native language]

1101
01:14:49,997 --> 01:14:53,033
[all shouting
in native language]

1102
01:15:07,414 --> 01:15:10,718
Where are you, Mansur?

1103
01:15:19,326 --> 01:15:20,561
Where are you going?

1104
01:15:20,627 --> 01:15:22,129
Let's go. Let's go.
Check the gate.

1105
01:15:22,196 --> 01:15:27,634
Let's go.

1106
01:15:27,701 --> 01:15:29,603
Yes, check the corners.

1107
01:15:29,670 --> 01:15:35,509
- [gasps]
- Every one.

1108
01:15:35,576 --> 01:15:39,246
Helicopter clear.

1109
01:15:39,313 --> 01:15:42,149
[indistinct] clear.

1110
01:15:42,216 --> 01:15:45,119
[indistinct].

1111
01:15:52,159 --> 01:15:55,062
[indistinct] clear.

1112
01:16:09,343 --> 01:16:12,212
- Clear.
- Search everywhere.

1113
01:16:26,293 --> 01:16:29,263
Okay.

1114
01:16:41,308 --> 01:16:44,211
[indistinct].

1115
01:17:22,082 --> 01:17:26,186
Wait.

1116
01:17:26,253 --> 01:17:29,189
Where is your gun?

1117
01:17:29,256 --> 01:17:30,958
I left it at the gate.

1118
01:17:31,024 --> 01:17:34,294
Stop.

1119
01:17:38,999 --> 01:17:41,935
- [speaking native language]
- Fuck.

1120
01:17:42,002 --> 01:17:45,472
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything. Please.

1121
01:17:45,540 --> 01:17:48,510
[speaking native language]

1122
01:17:48,576 --> 01:17:51,345
I didn't do anything.

1123
01:17:51,411 --> 01:17:54,214
[speaking native language]

1124
01:17:54,281 --> 01:17:55,315
I didn't do anything.
I didn't.

1125
01:17:55,382 --> 01:17:57,317
Move.

1126
01:17:57,384 --> 01:17:59,286
No, I swear to God
I didn't do anything.

1127
01:17:59,353 --> 01:18:05,959
Be quiet!

1128
01:18:06,026 --> 01:18:07,227
- Stay out here.
- Fuck.

1129
01:18:07,294 --> 01:18:09,730
- And watch the door.
- Fuck.

1130
01:18:09,796 --> 01:18:11,198
Get inside.

1131
01:18:11,265 --> 01:18:14,334
Look, look, look.
I... I didn't do anything.

1132
01:18:14,401 --> 01:18:18,372
I didn't say anything
I swear to God. I didn't.

1133
01:18:18,438 --> 01:18:20,207
- Shut up.
- Look, I didn't say anything.

1134
01:18:20,274 --> 01:18:22,042
You better [indistinct]
tell everything.

1135
01:18:22,109 --> 01:18:23,443
- I didn't say anything.
- Shut up.

1136
01:18:23,511 --> 01:18:26,413
Come on, man.

1137
01:19:19,534 --> 01:19:20,467
[loud bang]

1138
01:19:20,535 --> 01:19:21,768
Augh!

1139
01:19:21,835 --> 01:19:26,173
[gunshots]

1140
01:19:36,316 --> 01:19:37,585
Let's go. Move!

1141
01:19:37,652 --> 01:19:40,187
No, please.

1142
01:19:40,254 --> 01:19:42,456
No. No, no, [indistinct],
please.

1143
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:46,893
Go to the gate.

1144
01:19:46,960 --> 01:19:51,265
Guys, guys, I see them.
They're over here.

1145
01:19:51,331 --> 01:19:54,234
[rapid gunfire]

1146
01:21:25,959 --> 01:21:28,830
[indistinct].

1147
01:21:28,895 --> 01:21:29,797
I see him.
Come on.

1148
01:21:29,863 --> 01:21:32,999
[rapid gunfire]

1149
01:21:53,887 --> 01:21:56,990
Augh!

1150
01:22:55,015 --> 01:22:58,185
[gunfire]

1151
01:23:21,208 --> 01:23:26,614
Mansur. Mansur.

1152
01:23:26,681 --> 01:23:29,584
[rapid gunfire]

1153
01:23:37,692 --> 01:23:43,798
[loud explosion]

1154
01:23:43,865 --> 01:23:47,200
Augh.

1155
01:23:47,267 --> 01:23:50,370
[rapid gunfire]

1156
01:24:09,657 --> 01:24:10,892
Mansur, come here.

1157
01:24:10,958 --> 01:24:15,195
Come here.

1158
01:24:15,262 --> 01:24:18,465
Stop. Stop. Wait, stop.

1159
01:24:18,533 --> 01:24:20,935
I didn't do anything.
I didn't do anything.

1160
01:24:21,002 --> 01:24:23,069
Look, I didn't say
anything I swear.

1161
01:24:23,136 --> 01:24:24,572
You tell your boss.
You tell your boss.

1162
01:24:24,639 --> 01:24:27,642
I didn't say.
I didn't do anything.

1163
01:24:27,708 --> 01:24:29,710
The problem with being an
excellent liar

1164
01:24:29,777 --> 01:24:31,679
is no one can ever trust
a word you say.

1165
01:24:31,746 --> 01:24:38,519
No. No! No!

1166
01:24:38,586 --> 01:24:41,522
[gunfire]

1167
01:25:00,608 --> 01:25:02,275
You and your team cost me
a lot of money

1168
01:25:02,342 --> 01:25:07,080
for this piece of shit.

1169
01:27:54,215 --> 01:27:57,250
Mansur.

1170
01:27:57,317 --> 01:27:58,819
Stop.

1171
01:27:58,886 --> 01:28:03,456
Stop. Stop. I'm warning you.
Stop or I'll shoot.

1172
01:28:03,524 --> 01:28:05,059
You won't shoot me.
You need me alive.

1173
01:28:05,126 --> 01:28:06,259
Don't come out.

1174
01:28:06,326 --> 01:28:08,062
Can't let you leave.

1175
01:28:08,129 --> 01:28:10,498
Stop, I'm warning you.

1176
01:28:10,564 --> 01:28:16,504
Okay. All right. All right.
I'm dropping the weapon.

1177
01:28:16,570 --> 01:28:20,373
I'm unarmed, okay?
I'm stepping out.

1178
01:28:20,440 --> 01:28:22,576
Stop. I'm warning you. Stop.

1179
01:28:22,643 --> 01:28:24,245
I'm warning you;
I swear to God.

1180
01:28:24,310 --> 01:28:27,380
- I need to talk to you.
- I swear to God.

1181
01:28:27,447 --> 01:28:28,849
Just let me talk to you.

1182
01:28:28,916 --> 01:28:32,219
[shouts]

1183
01:28:32,285 --> 01:28:34,488
Amin. Amin.

1184
01:28:34,555 --> 01:28:38,826
It's your wife.
Your wife, she is pregnant.

1185
01:28:38,893 --> 01:28:41,028
- She's pregnant.
- That's rubbish.

1186
01:28:41,095 --> 01:28:42,096
I haven't seen her in months.

1187
01:28:42,163 --> 01:28:44,464
That's rubbish. You're lying.

1188
01:28:44,532 --> 01:28:47,134
Four months.
That's 16 weeks.

1189
01:28:47,201 --> 01:28:51,939
Look, it's a boy.

1190
01:28:52,006 --> 01:28:54,407
You see that?

1191
01:28:54,474 --> 01:28:55,976
They flew them
both out to D.C. to give you

1192
01:28:56,043 --> 01:28:58,712
a reason to stop this.
They're both in the blast zone.

1193
01:28:58,779 --> 01:29:02,348
But it's not too late.
You can still save them.

1194
01:29:02,415 --> 01:29:03,918
You just need to tell him
where the bomb is.

1195
01:29:03,984 --> 01:29:05,553
They don't have time
to search the whole of D.C.

1196
01:29:05,619 --> 01:29:11,492
You need to help us, please.
We need your help.

1197
01:29:11,559 --> 01:29:13,861
If you go out that gate,
your son and your wife

1198
01:29:13,928 --> 01:29:15,529
are gonna be dead.
Do you understand?

1199
01:29:15,596 --> 01:29:19,600
They're gonna be dead.
We need your help.

1200
01:29:19,667 --> 01:29:21,001
You couldn't save
your other son,

1201
01:29:21,068 --> 01:29:24,738
but now you have a chance
to save this one.

1202
01:29:24,805 --> 01:29:28,576
Please.

1203
01:29:28,642 --> 01:29:32,046
It's too late.
It's too late.

1204
01:29:32,112 --> 01:29:33,247
It's not too late.
It's not too late.

1205
01:29:33,314 --> 01:29:34,481
It's too late.

1206
01:29:34,548 --> 01:29:36,083
We can still get there.
We have time.

1207
01:29:36,150 --> 01:29:38,219
Put the gun down, Mansur.

1208
01:29:38,285 --> 01:29:42,089
Shit, you Liar. You liar.
I knew you were lying.

1209
01:29:42,156 --> 01:29:43,624
- No, you need to trust me.
- I knew it.

1210
01:29:43,691 --> 01:29:44,925
You need you to
trust me, please.

1211
01:29:44,992 --> 01:29:46,026
You're lying.

1212
01:29:46,093 --> 01:29:48,461
Everyone I lost here today
is on him.

1213
01:29:48,529 --> 01:29:50,064
I can't let him leave.

1214
01:29:50,130 --> 01:29:51,832
Yorke, you're not thinking
straight. You're injured.

1215
01:29:51,899 --> 01:29:53,399
You're not thinking straight.
Let me handle this.

1216
01:29:53,466 --> 01:29:56,604
- No, he's mine.
- Look, if you kill, him...

1217
01:29:56,670 --> 01:29:58,505
if you kill him, he's gonna die
believing he's one.

1218
01:29:58,572 --> 01:29:59,807
Is that what you want?

1219
01:29:59,874 --> 01:30:02,142
- You have no authority.
- It's all lies.

1220
01:30:02,209 --> 01:30:04,645
My wife isn't even pregnant.
She isn't even in Washington.

1221
01:30:04,712 --> 01:30:06,479
- Yes, she is.
- It's too late.

1222
01:30:06,547 --> 01:30:09,516
- She is.
- It's over.

1223
01:30:09,583 --> 01:30:12,653
Let him have
his revenge right now.

1224
01:30:12,720 --> 01:30:14,021
I'll take mine in D.C.

1225
01:30:14,088 --> 01:30:15,656
Please, don't do this.
Don't do this.

1226
01:30:15,723 --> 01:30:17,291
- No, put the gun down
- Stand down, Lieutenant.

1227
01:30:17,358 --> 01:30:21,061
- I can't do that.
- It's an order.

1228
01:30:21,128 --> 01:30:24,932
I already have
my fucking orders, sir.

1229
01:30:24,999 --> 01:30:28,401
[both grunting]

1230
01:30:28,468 --> 01:30:31,538
[helicopter blades whirring]

1231
01:30:50,257 --> 01:30:51,759
How do I know?

1232
01:30:51,825 --> 01:30:54,061
How do I know
you're not lying to me?

1233
01:30:54,128 --> 01:30:56,530
- How do I know?
- I can prove it to you.

1234
01:30:56,597 --> 01:30:58,464
As soon as we get to D.C.
I can prove it to you,

1235
01:30:58,532 --> 01:31:01,802
but we're running out of time.

1236
01:31:01,869 --> 01:31:05,539
Amin, we have your wife,
and I'm the only chance

1237
01:31:05,606 --> 01:31:10,177
you have of seeing her again.

1238
01:31:10,244 --> 01:31:14,248
Please, just give me the gun.

1239
01:31:14,315 --> 01:31:16,984
It's over. Give me the gun.

1240
01:31:22,523 --> 01:31:26,026
I don't know
what to believe in.

1241
01:31:26,093 --> 01:31:29,096
I don't know
what to believe in anymore.

1242
01:31:42,142 --> 01:31:47,114
If you're lying, it'll all be
for nothing. You know that.

1243
01:31:47,181 --> 01:31:49,149
I'm not lying.

1244
01:31:49,216 --> 01:31:55,990
I'm not lying.
Just... just give me the gun.

1245
01:31:56,056 --> 01:32:02,429
My son.

1246
01:32:02,496 --> 01:32:06,500
I hope you know
what you're doing.

1247
01:32:06,567 --> 01:32:08,335
He's our leverage.

1248
01:32:08,402 --> 01:32:09,636
Can you make it to the yellow?

1249
01:32:09,703 --> 01:32:11,605
No, I'll get the next one.

1250
01:32:11,672 --> 01:32:16,744
Just do what you gotta do
to stop this thing.

1251
01:32:16,810 --> 01:32:19,580
I'm gonna come back
for my team.

1252
01:32:27,221 --> 01:32:29,890
Okay, let's go.

1253
01:32:29,957 --> 01:32:32,726
Move.

1254
01:32:42,836 --> 01:32:45,939
[indistinct chatter]

1255
01:32:59,487 --> 01:33:02,589
[helicopter blades whirring]
