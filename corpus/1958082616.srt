[Amanda] Hi, Amanda Riley here
from Tourista World Travel.

8
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:37,166
Yes. Yes, it's gonna be okay, Mrs. Smith.

9
00:00:37,250 --> 00:00:40,541
Yes, I understand,
we are working as fast as we can.

10
00:00:40,625 --> 00:00:42,833
God, I miss smoking in a crisis.

11
00:00:42,916 --> 00:00:45,333
Ah, bingo. Mrs. Smith just sent a photo.

12
00:00:47,750 --> 00:00:49,708
Well, well, well, what do we have here?

13
00:00:51,333 --> 00:00:52,625
No, seriously,

14
00:00:53,208 --> 00:00:54,333
what do we have here?

15
00:00:55,666 --> 00:00:57,125
Ah, that's it.

16
00:00:57,625 --> 00:00:59,958
Mrs. Smith, it is your lucky day.

17
00:01:00,041 --> 00:01:01,958
We know where you and Mr. Smith are.

18
00:01:03,000 --> 00:01:05,500
Ye... Yes, you have boarded
the wrong booze cruise.

19
00:01:06,916 --> 00:01:10,208
Sure, I guess the tour group shirts
do kind of look alike.

20
00:01:11,291 --> 00:01:12,125
Ooh.

21
00:01:12,208 --> 00:01:15,291
Yes, we are rerouting the tour now
to pick you up immediately.

22
00:01:15,375 --> 00:01:17,125
[Mona] Never a dull moment.

23

Well done, Amanda.

25

It's on this year's list

26
00:01:28,833 --> 00:01:30,791
We keep losing clients to other companies

27
00:01:30,875 --> 00:01:33,958
because we don't have
one tour bus on the ground there.

28
00:01:35,125 --> 00:01:36,208

29
00:01:36,291 --> 00:01:39,000
I like this tone of intrigue.
What have you got?

30
00:01:39,083 --> 00:01:40,083
Saigon Silver Star.

31
00:01:40,125 --> 00:01:43,333
It's a small, family-run tour company.
The owner's thinking of selling.

32
00:01:43,416 --> 00:01:47,500
It's a little under the radar,
but it's got fantastic online reviews.

33
00:01:47,583 --> 00:01:50,541
Who do we send as a secret shopper
to see if it's worth bidding on?

34
00:01:50,625 --> 00:01:54,083
Well, I would like to send you, but
I've a feeling you're about to be busy.

35
00:01:54,708 --> 00:01:56,833
- Busy?
- Mm-hmm.

36
00:01:56,916 --> 00:02:00,833
John called. He wants to make sure
you come home early, not working late.

37
00:02:00,916 --> 00:02:04,541
He's clearly got something planned,
so I booked you a 4:00 p.m. manicure.

38
00:02:05,333 --> 00:02:07,500
Manicure? I'm... I'm not following.

39
00:02:08,375 --> 00:02:11,250
You're not following?
You two have been together forever.

40
00:02:11,333 --> 00:02:15,250
But... I mean,
five years isn't "forever forever."

41
00:02:15,333 --> 00:02:17,958
And he wants you
to come home early all of the sudden.

42
00:02:18,041 --> 00:02:20,375
The man is clearly putting a ring on it.

43
00:02:21,708 --> 00:02:24,833
I've been married nine times.
I know the signs. Don't question me.

of my life?

- So you're saying it's a special occasion?
- Potentially.

49

It's your hand.

50
00:02:44,833 --> 00:02:48,166

I don't know exactly what I thought,

was never gonna come, you know?

54

John and I have both
been really focused on our careers.

55
00:03:00,750 --> 00:03:02,250
- He has a job? That's cool.
- Yeah.

56
00:03:02,333 --> 00:03:03,500
He's an accountant.

57
00:03:03,583 --> 00:03:06,041
He's been on this really complex
tax fraud case.

58
00:03:06,125 --> 00:03:08,208
- My boyfriend was in one of those.
- Oh.

59
00:03:08,291 --> 00:03:10,333
But not as an accountant.

60
00:03:10,416 --> 00:03:12,583
Do you... wanna talk about it?

61
00:03:12,666 --> 00:03:13,791
- No.
- Okay.

62
00:03:13,875 --> 00:03:15,791
Can't. Court order.

63
00:03:16,541 --> 00:03:19,833
Also, my bosses said
manicure time is the customer's time, so...

64
00:03:21,375 --> 00:03:22,708
Tell me your big love story.

65
00:03:24,250 --> 00:03:27,083
Our first date
was at a paint and sip art night.

66
00:03:27,166 --> 00:03:29,125
John paid with a coupon, which was cool.

67
00:03:30,125 --> 00:03:31,625
And then we painted sunflowers.

68
00:03:31,708 --> 00:03:34,750
Well, actually, it turns out
we're both really terrible at paint,

69
00:03:34,833 --> 00:03:37,416
but very good at sip,
so at least we had that in common.

70
00:03:38,125 --> 00:03:40,875
But I really knew
that he was the one a couple weeks later

71
00:03:40,958 --> 00:03:43,000
when he offered to do my taxes.

72
00:03:43,750 --> 00:03:45,000
Taxes.

73
00:03:45,083 --> 00:03:46,083
Hot.

74
00:03:46,125 --> 00:03:48,041
It's his love language. [chuckles]

75
00:03:48,125 --> 00:03:49,125
Wow.

76
00:03:49,166 --> 00:03:51,166
So he's like a real, grown-up man.

77
00:03:51,250 --> 00:03:52,458
Exactly.

78
00:03:52,541 --> 00:03:55,333
And we're just...
We're so comfortable together, you know?

79
00:03:55,416 --> 00:03:56,875
It's just... It's really good.

80
00:03:56,958 --> 00:04:01,625
I cannot believe that a year from now,
I am going to be hitched.

81
00:04:01,708 --> 00:04:03,916
[chuckles] And I, like, I work in travel,

82
00:04:04,000 --> 00:04:07,250
so I will have hopefully
planned and executed the ideal honeymoon,

83
00:04:07,333 --> 00:04:10,958
and we'll just be
settling into our new normal.

84

Oh my God.

86
00:04:14,416 --> 00:04:15,833

What about red?

91
00:04:19,708 --> 00:04:23,458
Red's a statement. It's fiery, you know?
Who doesn't like a fiery statement?

92
00:04:23,541 --> 00:04:26,500
Or something different. More like a...

93
00:04:26,583 --> 00:04:27,958
Oh, a blue.

94
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,750

It's... an expression. Doesn't matter.

97
00:04:38,000 --> 00:04:40,583
This one. This is it. It's a classic.

98
00:04:41,458 --> 00:04:43,166
That's the color you wore in.

99
00:04:43,250 --> 00:04:46,458
Exactly. It is neutral, it is reliable.

100
00:04:47,208 --> 00:04:50,250
It goes with every outfit.
I mean, this color is your wing woman.

when you're on your own.

176
00:08:14,916 --> 00:08:18,750
Not that you're on your own,
just, you know, you should do it for you.

177
00:08:18,833 --> 00:08:19,833
[slams door]

178
00:08:20,625 --> 00:08:22,875
Okay. Amanda, I do...

179
00:08:22,958 --> 00:08:26,541
I recognize I probably could have
handled that a little bit differently,

180
00:08:26,625 --> 00:08:28,166
and I'm sorry, I just...

181
00:08:28,250 --> 00:08:30,750
You know that confrontation
gives me anxiety.

182
00:08:34,208 --> 00:08:38,625
Amanda, I'm sorry.
I... I... I really didn't mean to hurt you.

183
00:08:39,416 --> 00:08:40,583
[cries softly]

184
00:08:41,916 --> 00:08:43,958
[John] I do love you, you know.

[sobs]

187
00:08:49,583 --> 00:08:50,750
Hiatus?

188
00:08:50,833 --> 00:08:53,500
I mean, Amanda Riley
does not get put on hold.

189
00:08:53,583 --> 00:08:56,375
- Not this woman.
- Amanda Riley does not get put

190
00:08:56,458 --> 00:08:59,250
- on the back burner like a side dish.
- Not her style.

191
00:08:59,333 --> 00:09:01,833
Amanda Riley does not get postponed

192
00:09:01,916 --> 00:09:05,000
like some weird elective surgery
people are too polite to ask about.

193
00:09:05,083 --> 00:09:07,250
Oddly specific, but I'm following.

194
00:09:07,333 --> 00:09:09,125
You need to get out of town.

195
00:09:09,208 --> 00:09:11,666
We are sending you to Vietnam.

196
00:09:11,750 --> 00:09:12,583
Wha...

197
00:09:12,666 --> 00:09:15,666
Right, just take a dream vacation
right after I get dumped.

198
00:09:15,750 --> 00:09:19,583
Exactly. Explore a beautiful country
to forget somebody ripped your heart out

199
00:09:19,666 --> 00:09:21,208
into a million little pieces.

200
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:24,416
- [sighs]
- You go be our undercover secret shopper.

201
00:09:24,500 --> 00:09:28,166
The next tour leaves in two days
from Ho Chi Minh City to Hanoi for Tet,

202
00:09:28,250 --> 00:09:29,625
the Vietnamese new year.

203
00:09:30,250 --> 00:09:31,583
New year.

204
00:09:31,666 --> 00:09:33,458
New year, new me,

205
00:09:33,541 --> 00:09:35,916
starting with putting Tourista
on the map in Vietnam

206
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,166
as a tour company to be reckoned with.

207
00:09:38,250 --> 00:09:40,416
- I like your bounce back.
- Totally faking it.

208
00:09:40,500 --> 00:09:43,875
I have assembled
the dream Vietnam itinerary.

209
00:09:43,958 --> 00:09:47,250
Every site a tour needs
for a five-star experience.

210
00:09:48,166 --> 00:09:50,416
You go and be
our eyes and ears on the ground.

211
00:09:50,500 --> 00:09:52,666
What sort of company are we purchasing?

212
00:09:52,750 --> 00:09:57,541
Get back out there
and show the world who is Amanda Riley.

213
00:09:59,083 --> 00:10:03,416
[emotional music playing]

214

217
00:10:43,000 --> 00:10:44,166
[Amanda] Hi. Uh...

218
00:10:44,250 --> 00:10:47,083
[in Vietnamese] Do you know my suitcase?

219
00:10:47,166 --> 00:10:48,333
<i>Hành ly'?</i>

220
00:10:49,041 --> 00:10:50,041
Suitcase.

221
00:10:50,083 --> 00:10:52,500
- [in English] With the... <i>Hành ly.</i>
- Oh, <i>hành ly.</i>

222
00:10:52,583 --> 00:10:56,583
- The <i>hành lys</i>, and then they go around.
- Oh, baggage claim.

223
00:10:56,666 --> 00:10:57,791
Yes!

224

You speak English.

226
00:11:01,416 --> 00:11:02,583
- Yeah.
- Right.

227
00:11:02,666 --> 00:11:05,416
- Wanted to see how far this was gonna go.
- [chuckles]

228
00:11:06,500 --> 00:11:08,375
Saigon Silver Star.

229
00:11:10,041 --> 00:11:12,625
I'm Sinh. Sinh Thach, your new tour guide.

230
00:11:13,833 --> 00:11:15,958
I feel like you could've opened with that.

231
00:11:16,041 --> 00:11:17,166
Could've.

232
00:11:20,958 --> 00:11:24,041
[indistinct PA announcement]

233
00:11:24,125 --> 00:11:25,500
Just to confirm,

234
00:11:26,333 --> 00:11:28,583
are you certain that's not your bag?

235
00:11:31,750 --> 00:11:32,750
[man] Next.

236
00:11:33,750 --> 00:11:36,750
Just so you know,
there's a better way to do this.

237
00:11:37,583 --> 00:11:39,625
I know a guy who knows a guy.

238
00:11:40,625 --> 00:11:44,291
Wait, you know a guy who knows a guy who...

239
00:11:44,375 --> 00:11:45,666
Who can get your bag back.

240
00:11:45,750 --> 00:11:47,625
[chuckles] That's okay.

241
00:11:47,708 --> 00:11:50,791
I think we should just leave it
to the airline professionals.

242
00:11:50,875 --> 00:11:51,750
Okay.

243
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:52,833
[man] Next.

244
00:11:54,958 --> 00:11:57,750
Hi, I'm Amanda, and you are?

245
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:58,833
Yes.

246
00:12:00,416 --> 00:12:01,708
Really great at your job.

247
00:12:01,791 --> 00:12:03,750
Employee of the month every month, I bet.

248
00:12:04,541 --> 00:12:07,708
Why did I do that?
Anyway, hi, I seem to have lost my bag.

249
00:12:07,791 --> 00:12:10,333
It is a silver bag, it is a roller bag,

250
00:12:10,416 --> 00:12:12,833
and I really need to get it back
as soon as possible...

251
00:12:12,916 --> 00:12:14,375
We will call you.

252
00:12:14,458 --> 00:12:18,333
Oh, okay, great,
like in an hour? Maybe two...

253
00:12:18,416 --> 00:12:19,416
Next.

254
00:12:20,958 --> 00:12:22,125
Thank you so much.

255
00:12:22,791 --> 00:12:23,625
Yes.

256
00:12:23,708 --> 00:12:24,708
Right.

257
00:12:25,166 --> 00:12:26,208
Hi.

00:12:29,583 --> 00:12:30,583
[Sinh] Hey!

260
00:12:32,166 --> 00:12:35,375
Hey, finally.
I was about to give up on you two.

261

262
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:39,458
Her dad, my uncle,
owns Saigon Silver Star.

263
00:12:39,541 --> 00:12:42,541
Oh, so that kind of makes you Sinh's boss.

264
00:12:42,625 --> 00:12:44,416
[Anh, chuckling] Hey.

265
00:12:44,500 --> 00:12:45,750
I like your style.

266
00:12:47,000 --> 00:12:48,000
Um, no luggage?

267
00:12:48,041 --> 00:12:50,333
It seems like the airline
might have lost my bag.

268
00:12:50,416 --> 00:12:52,375
Don't worry, Sinh knows a guy.

269
00:12:52,458 --> 00:12:53,916
So I've heard.

270
00:12:54,666 --> 00:12:56,375

271

Joke's on them.

273
00:13:01,375 --> 00:13:04,250
They're not gonna experience
the real Vietnam, not like you.

274
00:13:04,333 --> 00:13:05,333
Right.

275
00:13:05,791 --> 00:13:09,458
Do, uh, do you guys happen
to offer welcome water?

276
00:13:09,541 --> 00:13:10,666
We'll get some at the hotel.

277
00:13:11,333 --> 00:13:13,291
Could we go over the itinerary on the way?

278
00:13:13,375 --> 00:13:16,833
Just relax and enjoy the view.
Sinh handles everything.

279
00:13:17,833 --> 00:13:20,333
Okay, and, uh, what do you do?

280
00:13:20,416 --> 00:13:21,500
What I do best.

281
00:13:22,708 --> 00:13:23,708
I drive.

Thank you.

Wow, this is a great view.

[Sinh] It's even more
amazing from the roof.

286

We have a group meet and greet
at seven o'clock.

287
00:14:24,666 --> 00:14:28,791
Are we gonna go over the itinerary then?
There's just so much to see.

288

I mean, Notre Dame,
Saigon Central Post Office...

Slow down, slow down.
I decide the schedule.

290
00:14:34,666 --> 00:14:36,041
You chose a tour, remember?

291
00:14:36,125 --> 00:14:37,291
That means no homework.

292
00:14:37,375 --> 00:14:41,333
Does that mean you're not even gonna peek
at my beautifully prepared agenda?

293
00:14:41,416 --> 00:14:42,416
It has tabs.

294
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:44,750
Sure.

295
00:14:45,250 --> 00:14:47,450
Is there anything else you need
before your bag arrives?

296
00:14:47,500 --> 00:14:49,666
Let's see <i>if </i>it arrives.

297
00:14:49,750 --> 00:14:51,333
Oh. You have zero faith.

298
00:14:51,416 --> 00:14:53,500
No, you're right, I absolutely do not,

- Well, what can I say. I was a Girl Scout.

00:15:05,666 --> 00:15:06,958
Thin Mints or Samoas?

305
00:15:07,791 --> 00:15:09,625
- Samoas, of course.
- Samoas?

306
00:15:09,708 --> 00:15:11,291
- Yeah.
- No, Thin Mints all the way.

about Girl Scouts?

00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:05,291
[Brian] Hello there.

351
00:17:05,375 --> 00:17:07,291
- Hi.
- Hi.

352
00:17:07,375 --> 00:17:08,708
Sorry we're late.

353
00:17:08,791 --> 00:17:10,916
Someone "accidentally" took a nap.

354
00:17:11,000 --> 00:17:11,833
Guilty!

355
00:17:11,916 --> 00:17:13,125
[chuckling]

356
00:17:13,208 --> 00:17:15,291
We're the Conways, Brian and Maya.

357
00:17:15,375 --> 00:17:16,708
- Hi, welcome.
- Hey.

358
00:17:16,791 --> 00:17:20,333
- [Sam] Nice to meet you.
- So, uh, what brings you to Vietnam?

359
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:23,250
Well, it's... it's our honeymoon.

360
00:17:23,333 --> 00:17:24,500
[Brian chuckles]

361
00:17:24,583 --> 00:17:26,958
Your honeymoon? That's so romantic.

362
00:17:27,583 --> 00:17:30,833
Well, we got married 40 years ago,
but we were broke then,

363
00:17:30,916 --> 00:17:34,166
but now we're retired, so here we are.

364
00:17:34,250 --> 00:17:36,875
- Better late than never.
- Oh.

365
00:17:38,166 --> 00:17:39,750
[Brian chuckles]

366
00:17:39,833 --> 00:17:42,125
And what brings you to Vietnam?

367
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,958
I just needed to get away.

368
00:17:45,041 --> 00:17:46,791
Yeah, just... [exhales] You know?

369
00:17:48,250 --> 00:17:51,291
You just got dumped, didn't you? What?

370
00:17:51,375 --> 00:17:55,083
I... What makes you...
What makes you say that?

371
00:17:55,166 --> 00:17:59,333
I mean, you're traveling alone,
making smart alcohol choices.

372
00:17:59,416 --> 00:18:03,000
Obviously a man very foolishly
allowed you to slip through his fingers.

373
00:18:03,083 --> 00:18:06,125
I just really needed a vacation. You know?

374
00:18:06,208 --> 00:18:08,125
Just anything
to get away from work, right?

375
00:18:08,208 --> 00:18:09,458
What is your line of work?

376
00:18:10,375 --> 00:18:11,375
Uh...

377
00:18:11,458 --> 00:18:13,333
I have an idea. This will be fun.

378
00:18:13,416 --> 00:18:16,083
How about we don't talk
about work at all, and at the end,

379
00:18:16,166 --> 00:18:18,208
we can all guess what everybody does?

380
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:20,458
- Oh, no work talk.
- Okay.

381
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:22,291
I like the sound of that.

382
00:18:23,041 --> 00:18:25,666
I bet you don't wanna
talk about it 'cause you can't.

383
00:18:25,750 --> 00:18:27,333
You're detail-oriented.

384
00:18:27,416 --> 00:18:29,208
You've got travel experience.

385
00:18:30,083 --> 00:18:31,208
Let me guess.

386
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:34,708
- You're an assassin.
- [all chuckle]

387
00:18:34,791 --> 00:18:35,791
Spy.

388
00:18:36,958 --> 00:18:37,875
Stylish fugitive.

389
00:18:37,958 --> 00:18:40,750
I can confirm or deny nothing.

390
00:18:40,833 --> 00:18:41,875
[all chuckle]

391
00:18:41,958 --> 00:18:43,375
It'll all come out in the end.

392
00:18:44,666 --> 00:18:49,375
Welcome to the Saigon Silver Star Family,
which happens to be my family.

393
00:18:50,208 --> 00:18:53,208
You're especially lucky
because your trip lands on Tet,

394
00:18:53,291 --> 00:18:55,875
which, if you read your guidebooks
like someone here...

395
00:18:55,958 --> 00:18:57,208
You would know that it is

396
00:18:57,291 --> 00:19:00,083
the most important celebration
in Vietnamese culture.

397
00:19:00,166 --> 00:19:03,416
[Sinh] That's right. It's a time
for letting go of the past year

398
00:19:03,500 --> 00:19:05,625
and opening yourself up
to new possibilities.

399
00:19:06,500 --> 00:19:09,458
Is there like
a traditional Vietnamese toast?

400
00:19:09,541 --> 00:19:11,916
We usually say, <i>"mot, hai, ba, yoo,"</i>

401
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,541
which is sort of like,
"One, two, three, go."

402
00:19:14,625 --> 00:19:20,041
[all] <i>Mot, hai, ba, yoo!</i>

403
00:19:20,125 --> 00:19:21,250
[all laughing]

404
00:19:21,333 --> 00:19:22,333
[Sam] Cheers.

405
00:19:23,041 --> 00:19:24,875
Guess what just arrived for you.

406
00:19:25,500 --> 00:19:27,541
Really? The suitcase, right?

407
00:19:27,625 --> 00:19:29,875
- We're both talking about the suitcase?
- Yeah.

408
00:19:29,958 --> 00:19:31,166
Thank you.

409
00:19:31,250 --> 00:19:32,250
Told you I knew a guy.

410
00:19:32,333 --> 00:19:33,333
[exhales]

411
00:19:34,125 --> 00:19:37,041
Mr. Saigon Silver Star
has some tricks up his sleeve.

412
00:19:37,125 --> 00:19:39,208
I can confirm or deny nothing.

413
00:19:46,250 --> 00:19:49,541
[Amanda] Then I ended up
miming a baggage carousel,

414
00:19:49,625 --> 00:19:51,958
which is harder to do
than you'd think by the way,

415
00:19:52,041 --> 00:19:54,708
before he revealed
that he speaks perfect English.

416
00:19:54,791 --> 00:19:58,083
You cannot stop
talking about this Sinh character.

417
00:19:58,166 --> 00:19:59,291
But is he yummy?

418
00:19:59,375 --> 00:20:02,041
Okay, we are grown women.
Why do you use words like that?

419
00:20:02,125 --> 00:20:03,625
[Mona] <i>Oh, whatever.</i>

420
00:20:03,708 --> 00:20:07,291
I just am excited about the prospect
of you getting back into the saddle

421
00:20:07,375 --> 00:20:08,458
after a big breakup.

422
00:20:08,541 --> 00:20:10,416
All right, fine, he's very handsome,

423
00:20:10,500 --> 00:20:14,083
but Sinh, his family
owns Saigon Silver Star,

424
00:20:14,166 --> 00:20:17,000
so he is a terrible candidate
for a vacation romance.

425
00:20:17,083 --> 00:20:18,416
[Mona] <i>Oh, don't be such a prude.</i>

426
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:19,791
Anyway, fill me in.

427
00:20:19,875 --> 00:20:23,250
We are going on a cyclo-tour
of Ho Chi Minh City this morning.

428
00:20:23,333 --> 00:20:24,958
<i>That sounds more fun than my night.</i>

429
00:20:25,041 --> 00:20:27,666
<i>I'm trying to spring
one of our clients from a Paris jail.</i>

430
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:30,541
What ding-dong shoplifts at the Louvre?

431
00:20:30,625 --> 00:20:31,791
[chuckles]

432
00:20:32,333 --> 00:20:33,333
Good luck.

433
00:20:34,958 --> 00:20:38,708
[gentle music playing]

434
00:20:47,500 --> 00:20:49,833
So, never heard the real answer.

435
00:20:49,916 --> 00:20:50,916
Why Vietnam?

436
00:20:51,000 --> 00:20:53,625
Oh, it's the number one
tourist destination.

437
00:20:54,166 --> 00:20:57,916
Beyond the obvious top ten list,
why Vietnam for you?

438
00:20:58,000 --> 00:20:59,541
- Uh...
- All right.

439
00:20:59,625 --> 00:21:02,500
It's gonna be you and me
stuck here together all morning.

440
00:21:02,583 --> 00:21:04,458
Might as well get to know each other.

441
00:21:06,291 --> 00:21:08,958
You know, just going through
something kind of personal,

442
00:21:09,041 --> 00:21:11,083
had to get out
of my regular routine, right?

443
00:21:11,875 --> 00:21:15,291
Traveling's good for that.
It forces us out of the comfort zone.

444
00:21:16,166 --> 00:21:20,166
I, uh...
Yeah, I used to travel a lot for work,

445
00:21:20,250 --> 00:21:22,875
but now I'm mostly chained to my desk.

446
00:21:22,958 --> 00:21:24,333
- [bang]
- Oh!

447
00:21:26,083 --> 00:21:29,125
- Uh, you okay?
- Yes. Yeah.

448
00:21:29,208 --> 00:21:30,416
[chuckling]

449
00:21:30,500 --> 00:21:32,583
Um, well, if you must know,

450
00:21:32,666 --> 00:21:34,958
- I've been doing my research on Tet.
- Mm.

451
00:21:36,083 --> 00:21:37,583
- No, no, no, no!
- No, no.

452
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:38,791
Put that guidebook away.

453
00:21:38,875 --> 00:21:40,000
- Why?
- It's for tourists.

454
00:21:40,083 --> 00:21:41,916
- I'm a tourist.
- No, you're a traveler.

455
00:21:42,000 --> 00:21:43,166
What's the difference?

456
00:21:43,250 --> 00:21:47,458
A tourist wants to escape life,
a traveler wants to experience it.

457
00:21:47,541 --> 00:21:50,166
What's bad about occasionally
wanting to escape your life?

458
00:21:50,250 --> 00:21:53,416
You never know how long life's gonna be.
Why waste it on escape?

459
00:21:54,291 --> 00:21:56,375
Spend it on experience instead.

460
00:22:02,750 --> 00:22:07,166
Marketplaces like this
are the center of commerce in Vietnam.

461
00:22:07,250 --> 00:22:09,333
It's also the focus of community life.

462
00:22:09,416 --> 00:22:12,500
Now, you could buy anything here,
from local artwork,

463
00:22:12,583 --> 00:22:15,291
to the latest design, to fresh fish.

464
00:22:15,375 --> 00:22:16,708
Now, who likes to shop?

465
00:22:16,791 --> 00:22:18,000
Me.

466
00:22:18,083 --> 00:22:20,083
Trick or treat bags.

467
00:22:20,166 --> 00:22:21,416
Oh, yay!

468
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:24,250
Here you go, here you go.

469
00:22:24,333 --> 00:22:28,333
I'm gonna do some major damage today.
Thanks for the dough, Mom.

470
00:22:28,416 --> 00:22:30,500
Wait, what?
How much money did you give her?

471
00:22:30,583 --> 00:22:31,916
- Thank you.
- [Dom] I don't know.

472
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,125
How much is ten million dong?

473
00:22:34,208 --> 00:22:35,333
What? That's ridiculous.

474
00:22:35,416 --> 00:22:38,291
["Tình Mo" by Phuong Tâm playing]

475
00:22:53,791 --> 00:22:56,375
[indistinct chatter]

476
00:23:07,583 --> 00:23:08,750
Oh.

477
00:23:10,875 --> 00:23:11,708
- Yeah?
- Mm-hmm.

478
00:23:11,791 --> 00:23:13,166
All right, here we go.

479
00:23:14,291 --> 00:23:15,375
[Alex] It's really yummy.

480
00:23:18,291 --> 00:23:22,125
- Alex, what do you got there?
- Here, smell.

481
00:23:22,208 --> 00:23:23,250
- [coughing]
- [laugh]

482
00:23:23,333 --> 00:23:24,250
Delicious.

483
00:23:24,333 --> 00:23:26,666
It's durian. So popular in Asia.

484
00:23:26,750 --> 00:23:29,500
- It's famous because of its aroma.
- Mm.

485
00:23:29,583 --> 00:23:30,416
Mm-hmm.

486
00:23:30,500 --> 00:23:32,250
You can really smell it.

487
00:23:32,333 --> 00:23:34,750
You should see your face.
I can rewind it if you want.

488
00:23:34,833 --> 00:23:35,666
No, please don't.

489
00:23:35,750 --> 00:23:37,833
It stinks, but it tastes so good.

490
00:23:37,916 --> 00:23:39,000
It's tasty, for real.

491
00:23:39,875 --> 00:23:41,041
Try it, please.

492
00:23:41,125 --> 00:23:41,958
Try it.

493
00:23:42,041 --> 00:23:44,500
I... I'm okay.

494
00:23:44,583 --> 00:23:45,666
Try it.

495
00:23:46,833 --> 00:23:49,708
Okay. Sure. Looks...

496
00:23:52,250 --> 00:23:55,375
- Just pick it up? Just pick it right up.
- It's big.

497
00:23:55,458 --> 00:23:56,458
Okay.

498
00:23:57,500 --> 00:24:00,291
It's like a banana...

499
00:24:01,000 --> 00:24:02,000
[clears throat]

500
00:24:07,166 --> 00:24:10,125
I don't know how,
but it's actually really good.

501
00:24:10,208 --> 00:24:12,208
- Yay! Wow!
- Yay!

502
00:24:12,750 --> 00:24:14,000
She likes it!

503
00:24:31,875 --> 00:24:34,875
The Phoenix.
It's a sacred creature in Vietnam.

504
00:24:34,958 --> 00:24:37,666
It symbolizes regeneration
and new beginnings.

505
00:24:38,291 --> 00:24:40,541
- It's perfect. I'm gonna get it.
- Yeah?

506
00:24:41,125 --> 00:24:42,833
[in Vietnamese] How much for the scarf?

507
00:24:42,916 --> 00:24:44,541
- Ten dollars.
- Ten.

508
00:24:44,625 --> 00:24:46,958
- [in English] She says it's US $10.
- Great.

509
00:24:48,000 --> 00:24:50,500
Whoa, whoa, whoa, what are you doing?

510
00:24:51,166 --> 00:24:52,208
Buying a scarf.

511
00:24:52,291 --> 00:24:53,791
No. You gotta bargain first.

512
00:24:54,375 --> 00:24:55,625
We'll say five dollars.

513
00:24:56,500 --> 00:24:58,333
It's just a couple bucks. I can pay.

514
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,875
It's not about the money.
She's trying to play you.

515
00:25:00,958 --> 00:25:02,416
First, you bargain.

516
00:25:02,500 --> 00:25:03,916
[in Vietnamese] Excuse me.

517
00:25:04,000 --> 00:25:05,208
How about five dollars?

518
00:25:05,291 --> 00:25:07,971
- I can't sell it for five dollars.
- [Sinh] It's only five dollars.

519
00:25:08,666 --> 00:25:09,666
Mm.

520
00:25:10,125 --> 00:25:12,833
[in English] If she doesn't accept
the price, we walk away.

521
00:25:14,041 --> 00:25:15,721
They always give in before we get too far.

522
00:25:16,625 --> 00:25:20,166
Ah, so if you really love something,

523
00:25:20,250 --> 00:25:24,333
give it away, and if it comes back to you
at a cheaper price, then it's fate?

524
00:25:24,416 --> 00:25:26,333
It's all about the walkaway.

525
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:28,583
Okay, let's do it.

526
00:25:32,958 --> 00:25:34,250
No, thank you.

527
00:25:34,875 --> 00:25:37,583
[playful music]

528
00:25:44,083 --> 00:25:47,458
- She's not calling after us.
- [Sinh] Keep walking. Just keep walking.

529
00:25:47,541 --> 00:25:48,583
[Amanda] Okay.

530
00:25:55,041 --> 00:25:56,041
Ah...

531
00:25:57,208 --> 00:25:58,375
She didn't give in.

532
00:25:58,458 --> 00:25:59,458
Oh.

533
00:25:59,958 --> 00:26:02,875
Some sellers are stubborn.
Hey, it happens.

534
00:26:02,958 --> 00:26:04,125
Next time.

535
00:26:08,541 --> 00:26:10,833
Hey, I'll meet up
with you guys outside, okay?

536
00:26:10,916 --> 00:26:11,750
Where you going?

537
00:26:11,833 --> 00:26:13,000
I'm getting that scarf.

538
00:26:13,625 --> 00:26:15,083
Okay, see you outside.

539
00:26:37,958 --> 00:26:39,583
Hey! We're over here!

540
00:26:39,666 --> 00:26:41,416
Hi! I see that.

541
00:26:41,500 --> 00:26:42,375
Um...

542
00:26:42,458 --> 00:26:43,791
Where's the crosswalk?

543
00:26:43,875 --> 00:26:45,208
[Sinh] No, there's no crosswalk.

544
00:26:45,291 --> 00:26:48,375
Just stick your hand out
and walk nice and slow.

545
00:26:48,458 --> 00:26:49,750
You'll be fine, come on.

546
00:26:49,833 --> 00:26:50,708
Here?

547
00:26:50,791 --> 00:26:51,791
[Sinh] Yeah.

548
00:26:52,416 --> 00:26:55,666
Uh... no. I don't want to do that.

549
00:26:55,750 --> 00:26:57,500
- You'll be fine, come on.
- [Amanda] I...

550
00:26:57,583 --> 00:27:00,000
I'm fine here.
I like it here. This is good.

551
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:04,625
[playful music]

552
00:27:07,208 --> 00:27:08,416
What... What are...

553
00:27:11,875 --> 00:27:14,291
[chuckles] How did you do that?

554
00:27:14,375 --> 00:27:17,458
The trick to Vietnamese traffic,
always forward, never back.

555
00:27:17,541 --> 00:27:18,583
Mm.

556
00:27:19,166 --> 00:27:20,208
Come on.

557
00:27:20,291 --> 00:27:21,291
Let's go.

558
00:27:24,083 --> 00:27:25,333
Trust me.

559
00:27:29,791 --> 00:27:30,875
I got you.

560
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,000
- Yay!
- Yeah!

561
00:27:44,083 --> 00:27:46,416
- [Sam] I knew you could do it, girl.
- Amazing.

562
00:27:47,208 --> 00:27:50,458
Thank you. I never could have
done that on my own, ever.

563
00:27:51,041 --> 00:27:52,583
Do you always sell yourself short?

564
00:27:52,666 --> 00:27:57,166
[scoffs] I'm not selling myself short.
I just... I know my limitations.

565
00:27:57,250 --> 00:27:58,708
So don't limit yourself.

566
00:28:08,541 --> 00:28:10,750
Hoi An, here we come!

567
00:28:10,833 --> 00:28:13,416
[uplifting music playing]

568
00:28:13,500 --> 00:28:14,708
[phone chimes]

569
00:28:48,958 --> 00:28:49,791
Here you go.

570
00:28:49,875 --> 00:28:50,875
Thank you.

571
00:28:51,500 --> 00:28:53,708
Hey, um, about tomorrow.

572
00:28:53,791 --> 00:28:58,375
Wild guess, you have an exhaustive list
of tourist sites for me to take a look at.

573
00:28:58,458 --> 00:29:02,000
Uh, I wouldn't call it exhaustive,
I would call it comprehensive.

574
00:29:02,083 --> 00:29:03,416
- Okay.
- It's right here.

575
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:04,916
You can just scroll.

576
00:29:05,000 --> 00:29:07,958
There's no way we'd be able to see
everything on that list.

577
00:29:08,041 --> 00:29:10,166
You're the one
who told me not to limit myself.

578
00:29:10,250 --> 00:29:11,791
I've been leading tours for a while,

579
00:29:11,875 --> 00:29:14,375
and there's things about travel
you may not understand.

580
00:29:15,000 --> 00:29:15,875
Oh, really?

581
00:29:15,958 --> 00:29:18,958
Vietnam, it's hot, it's crowded.
You could easily burn out.

582
00:29:19,583 --> 00:29:23,208
Part of the Saigon Silver Star experience
is seeing where the day takes you.

583
00:29:23,291 --> 00:29:25,541
Where I would love
to see the day take all of us

584
00:29:25,625 --> 00:29:27,625
is to a bunch of places on my list.

585
00:29:28,250 --> 00:29:30,000
You never do anything unexpected, huh?

586
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,333
Be impulsive? Go with the moment?

587
00:29:33,416 --> 00:29:34,896
The last time I went with the moment,

588
00:29:34,958 --> 00:29:36,875
I grossly misread it
and someone moved to Ohio.

589
00:29:36,958 --> 00:29:38,458
That's oddly specific.

590
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:40,916
I just would like to stick with a plan.

591
00:29:48,541 --> 00:29:53,166
Hey, everybody, unfortunately the temple
is closed right now.

592
00:29:53,250 --> 00:29:54,916
They are practicing for Tet.

593
00:29:55,000 --> 00:29:56,250
[group groans]

594
00:29:56,333 --> 00:29:57,625
Practicing what?

595
00:29:57,708 --> 00:29:58,833
[Anh] A lion dance.

596
00:29:58,916 --> 00:30:01,583
It's part of the temple's
annual Tet celebration.

597
00:30:01,666 --> 00:30:03,583
That's too bad. It sounds amazing.

598
00:30:03,666 --> 00:30:04,666
Mm.

599
00:30:05,291 --> 00:30:06,541
[Sinh] Hang on, guys.

600
00:30:06,625 --> 00:30:09,125
I may know a guy.
Let me see what I can do.

601
00:30:11,041 --> 00:30:14,375
[drumming]

602
00:30:32,666 --> 00:30:36,541
[gentle music playing]

603
00:30:49,333 --> 00:30:51,625
[Amanda] I'm impressed.
You really did know a guy.

604
00:30:51,708 --> 00:30:53,267
[Sinh] You gotta have your connections.

605
00:30:53,291 --> 00:30:54,291
Like this bridge.

606
00:30:54,791 --> 00:30:56,291
It's called Chùa Cau.

607
00:30:56,375 --> 00:30:58,916
Japanese traders built it
to connect with Chinese neighborhoods.

608
00:30:59,000 --> 00:31:00,458
It's beautiful.

609
00:31:03,416 --> 00:31:05,041
You're very good at your job.

610
00:31:05,125 --> 00:31:06,125
Wait.

611
00:31:06,791 --> 00:31:08,833
- Was that a compliment?
- Yes.

612
00:31:11,958 --> 00:31:13,166
What are you doing?

613
00:31:13,250 --> 00:31:14,458
Savoring the moment.

614
00:31:15,208 --> 00:31:17,333
My first Amanda Riley compliment.

615
00:31:17,416 --> 00:31:18,791
Feels nice.

616
00:31:19,541 --> 00:31:21,750
Okay, well, don't get used to it.

617
00:31:21,833 --> 00:31:24,833
Oh, so it is a rare and special thing.

618
00:31:24,916 --> 00:31:26,291
I'm even more honored.

619
00:31:27,250 --> 00:31:28,375
As you should be.

620
00:31:28,458 --> 00:31:29,583
[Sinh chuckles]

621
00:31:29,666 --> 00:31:30,666
Come on.

622
00:31:32,958 --> 00:31:34,708
[Amanda] That is cool.

623
00:31:34,791 --> 00:31:38,583
- They just leave it burning like that?
- Yeah, they just redo it over again.

624
00:31:38,666 --> 00:31:41,958
[gentle music continues]

625
00:31:45,125 --> 00:31:47,375
- I love this whole color scheme.
- Right.

626
00:31:47,458 --> 00:31:49,166
I think it's really gorgeous.

627
00:31:51,333 --> 00:31:52,250
This store is just...

628
00:31:52,333 --> 00:31:54,583
Hey, can I get something made for me?

629
00:31:54,666 --> 00:31:58,041
I'm sorry, are you actually
asking our permission for something?

630
00:31:58,125 --> 00:32:01,833
Well, I was actually thinking
we could get matching outfits.

631
00:32:01,916 --> 00:32:03,375
You know, as a family?

632
00:32:03,458 --> 00:32:04,458
Oh.

633
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,958
Sounds like an amazing idea.

634
00:32:07,916 --> 00:32:09,916
Cool, I'm gonna look around.

635
00:32:11,458 --> 00:32:13,708
- Who is this child?
- I don't know.

636
00:32:19,791 --> 00:32:20,916
Okay, let me help you,

637
00:32:21,000 --> 00:32:24,083
Mr. "Same shorts and t-shirt
three days in a row."

638
00:32:24,166 --> 00:32:27,583
I change my t-shirt every day,
I just packed eight of the same ones.

639
00:32:28,583 --> 00:32:30,500
I like you in this orange.

640
00:32:30,583 --> 00:32:32,208
Oh, wait, wait, wait.

641
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:33,458
This?

642
00:32:34,000 --> 00:32:35,291
Get a shirt made.

643
00:32:36,333 --> 00:32:38,500
Is that really my style?

644
00:32:39,375 --> 00:32:41,416
You do not have style. [scoffs]

645
00:32:41,500 --> 00:32:43,583
We're starting from scratch here, pal.

646
00:32:43,666 --> 00:32:44,666
Okay.

647
00:32:59,375 --> 00:33:00,916
[Sinh] No custom clothing for you?

648
00:33:01,541 --> 00:33:04,583
Oh, you know, I think I've packed plenty.

649
00:33:04,666 --> 00:33:05,916
What about Tet?

650
00:33:06,000 --> 00:33:06,875
What about it?

651
00:33:06,958 --> 00:33:08,833
I thought you were the guidebook expert?

652
00:33:08,916 --> 00:33:10,956
It's tradition to wear
new clothes for the new year.

653
00:33:11,000 --> 00:33:13,458
Bright colors invite luck and prosperity.

654
00:33:13,541 --> 00:33:15,875
Huh. In that case, where do I start?

655
00:33:15,958 --> 00:33:16,958
All right.

656
00:33:20,750 --> 00:33:21,958
That's the one.

657
00:33:22,041 --> 00:33:24,083
[gentle music playing]

658
00:33:24,166 --> 00:33:28,041
Are you sure? I mean,
that's just not what I usually wear.

659
00:33:28,125 --> 00:33:30,875
That's why you should wear it.
Get out of your comfort zone.

660
00:33:30,958 --> 00:33:32,916
He's right, for once.

661
00:33:34,958 --> 00:33:35,958
Stop it.

662
00:33:46,250 --> 00:33:48,666
[indistinct whispering]

663
00:33:51,458 --> 00:33:54,958
Okay, guys, let's get to the hotel
and chill before dinner.

664
00:33:55,041 --> 00:33:56,041
Okay.

665
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,851
- [Sinh] We'll see you guys there, okay?
- Oh, okay.

666
00:33:59,875 --> 00:34:02,458
[phone vibrating]

667
00:34:02,541 --> 00:34:05,125
[tense music playing]

668
00:34:05,208 --> 00:34:06,208
We're not chilling.

669
00:34:07,916 --> 00:34:09,000
We're not?

670
00:34:09,083 --> 00:34:10,541
I got something to show you.

671
00:34:10,625 --> 00:34:12,625
[phone continues vibrating]

672
00:34:12,708 --> 00:34:13,750
Wanna get that?

673
00:34:15,916 --> 00:34:17,000
Uh...

674
00:34:21,958 --> 00:34:22,875
Not at all.

675
00:34:22,958 --> 00:34:24,750
[Sinh] All right. Let's go.

676
00:34:29,083 --> 00:34:32,416
Since we didn't get to see
all the sites on your list today,

677
00:34:32,916 --> 00:34:34,708
I wanted to make it up to you.

678
00:34:34,791 --> 00:34:38,791
By walking me down this dark,
deserted alleyway? Hmm?

679
00:34:38,875 --> 00:34:42,833
I thought you were a fugitive or a spy?
Where's your sense of adventure?

680
00:34:42,916 --> 00:34:46,333
My sense of adventure is on hold
until you tell me where we're going.

681
00:34:46,833 --> 00:34:49,916
That's literally the opposite
of a sense of adventure.

682
00:34:56,208 --> 00:34:59,750
[gentle music playing]

683
00:35:03,000 --> 00:35:04,125
I'm speechless.

684
00:35:05,583 --> 00:35:07,458
That's a first for me.

685
00:35:07,541 --> 00:35:08,916
I knew you'd like it.

686
00:35:13,833 --> 00:35:18,541
You know, this city is more than a list
of tourist attractions to be checked off.

687
00:35:19,291 --> 00:35:22,666
Sometimes traveling
is soaking in the atmosphere.

688
00:35:23,416 --> 00:35:26,500
All I can say is just wow.

689
00:35:27,458 --> 00:35:30,375
And hey, that's two
Amanda Riley compliments for you.

690
00:35:31,208 --> 00:35:32,875
"Wow" is a compliment?

691
00:35:34,125 --> 00:35:35,125
"Wow" as in,

692
00:35:35,166 --> 00:35:40,250
"Wow, I think you actually really knew
what I needed to see before I did."

693
00:35:41,208 --> 00:35:43,416
All right. That <i>is </i>a compliment.

694
00:35:43,500 --> 00:35:45,541
[exhales] I better pace myself.

695
00:35:47,250 --> 00:35:50,708
So, uh... how long have you been doing this?

696
00:35:50,791 --> 00:35:52,458
I mean, leading tours?

697
00:35:52,541 --> 00:35:54,583
Despite my expertise...

698
00:35:54,666 --> 00:35:55,958
[chuckles]

699
00:35:56,041 --> 00:35:58,916
- Five, six years. Not very long.
- What'd you do before that?

700
00:35:59,000 --> 00:36:02,333
Well, my mom wanted me to stay
in the US, get a suit-and-tie job.

701
00:36:02,958 --> 00:36:06,583
But I came back here after college,
worked at my dad's restaurant in Hue.

702
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:11,375
One day, Anh called, said her dad
needed help with the tour business.

703
00:36:11,458 --> 00:36:14,083
I mean, I was hesitant to take the offer.

704
00:36:14,166 --> 00:36:16,250
Why? I mean, you're such a natural.

705
00:36:17,000 --> 00:36:22,375
The pressure to show visitors
the best possible version of Vietnam.

706
00:36:22,458 --> 00:36:25,041
I mean, I was born here,

707
00:36:25,125 --> 00:36:28,166
but a big part of me is American too.

708
00:36:29,625 --> 00:36:34,000
And it feels so amazing to share Vietnam
with the rest of the world.

709
00:36:34,791 --> 00:36:37,125
Once I did my first tour, I was hooked.

710
00:36:37,208 --> 00:36:38,416
Never turned back.

711
00:36:42,333 --> 00:36:43,833
Well, I'm glad.

712
00:36:44,916 --> 00:36:47,458
I mean, look at me.
Who knows where I'd be without you?

713
00:36:50,083 --> 00:36:51,791
Still waiting to buy that scarf.

714
00:36:51,875 --> 00:36:53,666
Why did she hate me so much?

715
00:36:53,750 --> 00:36:56,333
I think she sensed
a master bargainer in you.

716
00:36:56,416 --> 00:36:57,500
She saved herself.

717
00:36:57,583 --> 00:36:59,541
[Amanda] Yeah, that's it.

718
00:37:01,083 --> 00:37:03,166
[Sinh] There's one more thing
I want to show you.

719
00:37:17,416 --> 00:37:21,666
[gentle music playing]

720
00:37:21,750 --> 00:37:23,541
[Sinh] Now, make a wish.

721
00:37:49,708 --> 00:37:51,083
What did you wish for?

722
00:37:52,416 --> 00:37:54,916
I can't tell you, or it won't come true.

723
00:37:55,000 --> 00:37:57,041
[chuckles] You really believe that?

724
00:37:57,875 --> 00:37:59,416
- Maybe.
- [chuckles]

725
00:38:00,666 --> 00:38:03,250
Apparently you don't,
so tell me, what did you wish for?

726
00:38:03,875 --> 00:38:04,916
Top secret.

727
00:38:05,000 --> 00:38:06,708
See? You believe the same thing.

728
00:38:06,791 --> 00:38:08,250
It's good to cover my bases.

729
00:38:09,708 --> 00:38:11,125
Just in case.

730
00:38:28,333 --> 00:38:32,208
[gentle music continues]

731
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:52,666
[Robin] Not like that, hold it higher.

732
00:38:53,250 --> 00:38:56,083
For a super camera dork,
you know nothing about taking selfies.

733
00:38:56,166 --> 00:38:58,958
I prefer photos of things that aren't me.

734
00:38:59,041 --> 00:39:01,125
Especially not photos
I'm taking of myself.

735
00:39:01,208 --> 00:39:04,083
That's because you don't know
how to take one. Okay, look.

736
00:39:04,166 --> 00:39:06,166
Put it over your head. Look up.

737
00:39:06,708 --> 00:39:09,208
Almost, and there, go for it.

00:39:11,750 --> 00:39:13,750
- Whoa!
- Oh! Yeah, that looks good. See?

740
00:39:13,833 --> 00:39:15,458
[Alex laughs] Thank you.

741
00:39:15,541 --> 00:39:18,625
Oh, that guy says he'll teach us
how to row the round boat. Come on.

[sultry music playing]

00:39:47,416 --> 00:39:49,458
[Sinh] Oh, what's this?

744
00:39:50,083 --> 00:39:52,708
Amanda Riley... doing nothing?

745
00:39:54,041 --> 00:39:56,833
Doing nothing feels, uh, very weird.

746
00:39:56,916 --> 00:39:59,500
- Keep practicing. You'll get better at it.
- Right.

747
00:39:59,583 --> 00:40:01,791
[Alex] Hey! We're in the boat!

748
00:40:01,875 --> 00:40:02,708
Woo!

749
00:40:02,791 --> 00:40:06,250
- It's kind of scary!
- It's not scary. Don't be a baby.

750
00:40:06,333 --> 00:40:07,166
[chuckles]

751
00:40:07,250 --> 00:40:09,210
- They look like they're having fun.
- [Sinh] Yes.

752
00:40:10,041 --> 00:40:11,041
Let's go.

753
00:40:12,000 --> 00:40:14,916
In... In the saucer?

754
00:40:15,000 --> 00:40:16,000
[Sinh] Mm-hmm.

755
00:40:21,208 --> 00:40:23,250
So, when was the last time you did this?

756
00:40:23,333 --> 00:40:24,708
- Never.
- Never?

757
00:40:24,791 --> 00:40:25,916
[Sinh chuckles]

758
00:40:26,000 --> 00:40:27,583
That's why I wanted to try.

759
00:40:29,791 --> 00:40:32,666
Okay, in that case,
may I offer up a suggestion?

760
00:40:32,750 --> 00:40:34,666
I think just try to...
Just try wiggling it.

761
00:40:34,750 --> 00:40:36,041
- Wiggle?
- Like a rudder.

762
00:40:36,125 --> 00:40:37,791
- All right, you wanna try?
- Yeah.

763
00:40:41,666 --> 00:40:44,000
- Wiggle, wiggle. No.
- You don't do that.

764
00:40:44,083 --> 00:40:46,416
What I'm gonna do is more of a...

765
00:40:46,500 --> 00:40:48,666
Okay. Yeah, yeah.

766
00:40:52,291 --> 00:40:54,416
Okay, we are truly getting nowhere.

[Sinh laughs]

768
00:40:55,583 --> 00:40:58,166
And don't say something
deep and metaphorical about that.

769
00:40:58,250 --> 00:41:01,625
Nope. Never. You're just bad at paddling.

770
00:41:01,708 --> 00:41:02,750
Hey, here. Let me try.

771
00:41:02,833 --> 00:41:05,041

- No, let me.

- I can't swim!

00:41:12,125 --> 00:41:13,500

[Anh] Hey, guys!

782
00:41:40,625 --> 00:41:44,833
Sinh, bad news. There's a three-hour wait
for the Golden Hand Bridge tickets.

You don't know a guy for that?

Hey, guys, new destination.

One even better
than the Golden Hand Bridge.

Better than the Golden Hand Bridge?

790
00:42:02,875 --> 00:42:03,875
Yeah, way better.

791
00:42:05,000 --> 00:42:06,458

792

Yeah, where are we?

- Impatient?

that's why she hired me.

[poignant music playing]

797
00:42:28,916 --> 00:42:29,916
Wow.

798
00:42:43,000 --> 00:42:44,666
These are ancient Hindu temples

799
00:42:44,750 --> 00:42:48,625
built over the course of a thousand years
by the ancestors of the Cham people.

800
00:42:48,708 --> 00:42:52,166
The Champa Empire
ruled parts of Vietnam for many centuries.

801
00:42:52,250 --> 00:42:55,750
Their kings built these temples
to worship the deity Shiva.

802
00:42:56,375 --> 00:42:57,750
Feel free to explore, guys.

804

It's a wonder, right?

805
00:43:42,333 --> 00:43:43,958
I mean, how did they build this?

806
00:43:44,583 --> 00:43:47,208
There are many theories,
but no one knows for sure.

807
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,541
Embrace the mystery,

808
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:51,250

809
00:43:54,208 --> 00:43:57,041
So, My Son isn't on the usual tour?

00:43:57,125 --> 00:43:57,958
[Sinh] No.

811
00:43:58,041 --> 00:44:01,333
Everyone wants to go and see
the Golden Hand Bridge, which is awesome,

812
00:44:01,958 --> 00:44:04,458
but this place, it's something else.

814
00:44:09,208 --> 00:44:10,208
I can feel it.

It's kind of like I'm...

816
00:44:17,791 --> 00:44:21,625
transported to another time
and place, you know? It's...

It's not just another tourist site, it's...

00:44:25,625 --> 00:44:27,125
it's an experience.

819
00:44:29,291 --> 00:44:30,416
Agreed.

820
00:44:33,208 --> 00:44:36,541
I can't believe I'm about to say this,
but I want more of this.

821
00:44:37,083 --> 00:44:39,364
I want experience.
I don't want something in my guidebook.

I want off the beaten path.

00:47:44,375 --> 00:47:46,208
[all] Hello.

875
00:47:47,125 --> 00:47:48,166
[in English] Welcome.

876
00:47:48,250 --> 00:47:50,958
[all laughing]

877
00:47:52,625 --> 00:47:54,041
Uh... [clears throat]

878
00:47:54,125 --> 00:47:56,833
[in Vietnamese] We are honored to be here.

879
00:47:58,125 --> 00:48:00,291
- [in English] Was that a sentence?
- That was good.

880
00:48:03,500 --> 00:48:06,958
[in Vietnamese]
You like this one, don't you?

881
00:48:07,041 --> 00:48:09,625
Finally, you bring
a girl around for my approval.

882
00:48:09,708 --> 00:48:12,041
Come on, Grandma! We have guests!

883
00:48:13,083 --> 00:48:16,500
[in English] Sinh and I are basically
related to everyone in Thôn Chàng.

884
00:48:16,583 --> 00:48:18,375
Which makes sleeping arrangements easy.

885
00:48:18,916 --> 00:48:21,125
Brian and Maya, you'll be with Uncle Hoa.

886
00:48:21,208 --> 00:48:24,583
Robin, Sam, and Dom,
you'll be with Auntie Diem.

887
00:48:24,666 --> 00:48:25,875
Alex, you'll be with...

888
00:48:26,416 --> 00:48:31,625
[in Vietnamese] Tell Google Translate Lady
she can stay at my house.

889
00:48:31,708 --> 00:48:33,000
[in English] Yeah.

890
00:48:33,083 --> 00:48:37,333
Amanda, my grandmother
invited you to stay with her.

891
00:48:37,416 --> 00:48:38,708
Oh, great.

892
00:48:43,416 --> 00:48:44,875
Yeah, this one's good.

893
00:48:44,958 --> 00:48:47,458
This is called "Kho Bo."

894
00:48:47,541 --> 00:48:48,958
- Kho Bo?
- Kho Bo.

895
00:48:49,041 --> 00:48:52,000
Try some. A little bit.
Try a little. It could be a little spicy.

896
00:48:52,083 --> 00:48:55,208
[indistinct chatter]

897
00:48:55,291 --> 00:48:56,583
Yeah. Do you?

898
00:48:56,666 --> 00:48:57,666
Yeah.

899
00:49:00,041 --> 00:49:03,250
[indistinct chatter continues]

900
00:49:07,375 --> 00:49:11,333
[John] <i>Hey, so you're probably
not listening to this voicemail,</i>

901
00:49:11,416 --> 00:49:13,375
<i>but just in case you are,</i>

902
00:49:13,458 --> 00:49:16,291
<i>I just want to let you know
that I get it. I'm an idiot.</i>

903
00:49:16,375 --> 00:49:18,458
<i>- I messed up big time...</i>
- Hey.

904
00:49:18,541 --> 00:49:19,625
How you doing?

905
00:49:19,708 --> 00:49:20,708
Hey.

906
00:49:22,041 --> 00:49:22,875
Uh...

907
00:49:22,958 --> 00:49:24,166
Good, good.

908
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:26,541
So... [clears throat]

909
00:49:27,750 --> 00:49:30,833
...when you said detour,
you were not messing around.

910
00:49:30,916 --> 00:49:33,500
- It's worth it though, right?
- Oh, absolutely.

911
00:49:33,583 --> 00:49:37,666
I mean, it's everything I ever imagined
the Vietnamese countryside could be.

912
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:40,166
Plus it has strangely fast Wi-Fi.

913
00:49:40,250 --> 00:49:41,708
[chuckles]

914
00:49:41,791 --> 00:49:44,000
- Grandma loves her <i>Candy Crush</i>.
- [chuckles]

915
00:49:45,041 --> 00:49:47,583
You know, village life
has changed since I was kid.

916
00:49:47,666 --> 00:49:50,583
But a lot of the old ways
stayed the same, though.

917
00:49:51,291 --> 00:49:54,041
I know some Americans
think of Vietnam only in terms of war,

918
00:49:54,125 --> 00:49:56,375
but it's just
a small piece of our history.

919
00:49:57,333 --> 00:49:58,333
Definitely.

920
00:50:00,125 --> 00:50:02,916
So, um, how long will we be here?

921
00:50:03,000 --> 00:50:04,708
Until Têt, which is two days away.

922
00:50:04,791 --> 00:50:07,750
It's tradition to head back
to your village for the new year.

923
00:50:07,833 --> 00:50:11,833
Ah. Well, I know your grandmother's
thrilled to have you and Anh visit.

924
00:50:13,375 --> 00:50:15,750
Anh, yes. Me?

925
00:50:15,833 --> 00:50:17,916
And she'll keep me guessing as punishment.

926
00:50:18,000 --> 00:50:19,125
[both laugh]

927
00:50:19,208 --> 00:50:20,916
<i>Bà Noi </i>is a tough cookie.

928
00:50:22,666 --> 00:50:26,208
- You're afraid of her, aren't you?
- Yes, 100%.

929
00:50:26,291 --> 00:50:27,625
She's all bark, no bite.

930
00:50:27,708 --> 00:50:29,708
Yeah, but her bark is pretty scary.

931
00:50:29,791 --> 00:50:32,333
What? Does Amanda Riley
need me to protect her?

932
00:50:33,041 --> 00:50:36,958
Really? Protect me from <i>Bà Noi?</i>
You think you got what it takes?

933
00:50:37,875 --> 00:50:39,833
Truthfully, no. [laughs]

934
00:50:42,541 --> 00:50:46,791
Sinh! I'm not cleaning up by myself.
Come help. Now!

935
00:50:46,875 --> 00:50:48,708
Ah, so close to sweet freedom.

936
00:50:50,250 --> 00:50:51,958
- Sorry.
- Goodnight, Amanda.

937
00:50:52,708 --> 00:50:53,750
Goodnight, Sinh.

938
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:54,833
Sleep well.

939
00:50:57,000 --> 00:51:00,000
[romantic music playing]

940
00:51:17,791 --> 00:51:19,208
[door bangs against wall]

941
00:51:26,125 --> 00:51:28,833
<i>Bà Noi's </i>an early riser.
I figured you'd be up.

942
00:51:31,291 --> 00:51:32,166
[Amanda] Um...

943
00:51:32,250 --> 00:51:35,791
- Are, uh... are those for me?
- Yeah.

944
00:51:35,875 --> 00:51:38,916
We clean out the old year
before the new one comes in. Fresh start.

945
00:51:40,875 --> 00:51:42,333
You said off the beaten path.

946
00:51:42,958 --> 00:51:46,583
["Em Chào Tet" by Bích Phuong
& Co.Opmart playing]

947
00:52:06,083 --> 00:52:07,916
[speaking in Vietnamese]

948
00:52:08,000 --> 00:52:09,208
[chuckling]

949
00:52:13,125 --> 00:52:14,458
[Alex] Wow.

950
00:52:14,541 --> 00:52:15,875
So cool.

951
00:52:21,666 --> 00:52:23,583
[indistinct chatter]

952
00:52:33,541 --> 00:52:35,208
[laughing]

953
00:52:50,291 --> 00:52:51,500
[laughing]

954
00:52:56,208 --> 00:52:57,208
- Yeah?
- Wow.

955
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,708
<i>Bà Noi </i>reminds me a lot of my grandmother.

956
00:53:39,291 --> 00:53:42,333
She was a tough cookie also.

957
00:53:43,750 --> 00:53:45,125
So that's where you get it.

958
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,208
Definitely not as strong as she was.

959
00:53:50,625 --> 00:53:55,125
[sighs] She, uh...
she passed two Christmases ago now.

960
00:53:57,083 --> 00:53:58,083
[softly] Sorry.

961
00:54:00,708 --> 00:54:02,291
You miss her a lot, don't you?

962
00:54:09,875 --> 00:54:12,416
Then this Têt, you send her a message.

963
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,291
Pay your respects.

964
00:54:16,208 --> 00:54:17,458
I think she'd like that.

965
00:54:18,416 --> 00:54:20,208
The spirits are always listening.

966
00:54:22,333 --> 00:54:25,375
[tender music playing]

967
00:55:33,833 --> 00:55:34,833
What is this?

968
00:55:35,333 --> 00:55:38,375
Burning offerings,
sending them to our ancestors,

969
00:55:38,458 --> 00:55:39,833
asking for their blessings.

970
00:56:02,916 --> 00:56:03,916
Hey.

971
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:05,500
So I have <i>Bà Noi's </i>grocery list.

972
00:56:05,583 --> 00:56:06,458
Let's hit the road.

973
00:56:06,541 --> 00:56:08,083
What, on that thing?

974
00:56:09,333 --> 00:56:11,250
But it has no airbags or doors,

975
00:56:11,333 --> 00:56:14,083
or anything preventing us
from hitting the actual road.

976
00:56:15,041 --> 00:56:16,458
Then you better hold on tight.

977
00:56:18,166 --> 00:56:20,166
[upbeat Vietnamese song playing]

978
00:56:30,541 --> 00:56:33,041
[laughing]

979
00:56:33,125 --> 00:56:34,125
[yelps]

980
00:56:53,208 --> 00:56:54,750
Oh, wow. What is this?

981
00:56:55,833 --> 00:56:57,166
Young bamboo shoots.

982
00:56:57,250 --> 00:56:58,416
You can eat this?

983
00:56:58,500 --> 00:57:00,333
I mean, it's very cool-looking.

984
00:57:00,416 --> 00:57:01,541
[Sinh] It's delicious.

985
00:57:02,583 --> 00:57:05,791
You know, this off-the-beaten-path detour
has given me new ideas.

986
00:57:05,875 --> 00:57:07,291
Yeah? How so?

987
00:57:07,375 --> 00:57:10,458
My uncle's retiring soon.
I'm hoping to take over the business.

988
00:57:11,416 --> 00:57:14,416
I wanna take Saigon Silver Star
in a whole different direction.

989
00:57:14,500 --> 00:57:16,333
Challenge travelers' perceptions.

990
00:57:16,416 --> 00:57:19,125
Open them up to unforgettable experiences.

991
00:57:19,791 --> 00:57:22,791
I, uh... I think that's a great idea.

992
00:57:22,875 --> 00:57:24,291
Yeah? You do?

993
00:57:24,375 --> 00:57:26,583
Yeah. I'm having the time of my life, so...

994
00:57:27,541 --> 00:57:28,541
Me too.

995
00:57:30,875 --> 00:57:34,541
So, um... [clears throat]
...has your uncle ever mentioned...

996
00:57:34,625 --> 00:57:38,041
Hold that thought. Baby jackfruit.
<i>Bà Noi </i>will kill me if it sells out.

997
00:57:38,833 --> 00:57:41,000
...possibly selling the business?

998
00:57:42,458 --> 00:57:43,291
Right.

999
00:57:43,375 --> 00:57:46,083
[Sinh speaking Vietnamese]

1000
00:57:46,166 --> 00:57:47,333
[sighs]

1001
00:58:01,000 --> 00:58:01,916
[Anh] Hey.

1002
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:03,875
Just came to check whether you're okay.

1003
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:05,833
Yes. Great, thank you.

1004
00:58:07,875 --> 00:58:08,875
Hello.

1005
00:58:13,875 --> 00:58:16,041
[in Vietnamese]
I want to talk to our visitor.

1006
00:58:16,708 --> 00:58:19,958
- Are you planning to interrogate her?
- No. Now ask.

1007
00:58:21,208 --> 00:58:22,791
[in English] She wants me to translate.

1008
00:58:22,875 --> 00:58:25,541
Oh, yes. Please, go for it.

1009
00:58:26,458 --> 00:58:27,778
[in Vietnamese] What did she say?

1010
00:58:28,583 --> 00:58:32,416
Ask her if she has her eyes on our Sinh.

1011
00:58:34,833 --> 00:58:37,125
Don't laugh! This is important!

1012
00:58:37,208 --> 00:58:40,250
[in English] She wants to know
your intentions with Sinh.

1013
00:58:40,791 --> 00:58:42,041
Are you single?

1014
00:58:42,916 --> 00:58:44,833
Did she definitely ask that last part?

1015
00:58:44,916 --> 00:58:47,958
- Nah, I did. I'm curious.
- [clears throat] Right.

1016
00:58:48,458 --> 00:58:49,583
Um... [clears throat]

1017
00:58:49,666 --> 00:58:50,791
Yes, I am single.

1018
00:58:51,416 --> 00:58:54,916
And as for Sinh, he is...

1019
00:58:56,083 --> 00:59:00,916
I mean, he's so smart and funny
and insanely handsome,

1020
00:59:01,000 --> 00:59:04,416
but, uh, I live in California,

1021
00:59:04,500 --> 00:59:06,458
so my intention

1022
00:59:07,458 --> 00:59:09,583
is to be his friend.

1023
00:59:11,375 --> 00:59:12,695
[in Vietnamese] What did she say?

1024
00:59:13,333 --> 00:59:14,333
Mm.

1025
00:59:15,083 --> 00:59:17,291
She says he is handsome...

1026
00:59:17,375 --> 00:59:18,458
Mm.

1027
00:59:19,250 --> 00:59:21,458
...but she only wants to be friends.

1028
00:59:23,083 --> 00:59:24,958
I don't believe her!

1029
00:59:25,666 --> 00:59:27,875
This girl makes Sinh smile.

1030
00:59:28,708 --> 00:59:30,666
I like it when Sinh smiles.

1031
00:59:32,625 --> 00:59:34,416
[in English]
Yeah, she doesn't believe you.

1032
00:59:35,458 --> 00:59:37,375
You make her grandson smile,

1033
00:59:38,333 --> 00:59:40,625
and she loves when her grandson smiles.

1034
00:59:53,125 --> 00:59:54,833
You do like him, right?

1035
00:59:56,208 --> 00:59:57,208
I...

1036
00:59:57,833 --> 00:59:59,875
I just wish it wasn't so complicated.

1037
00:59:59,958 --> 01:00:01,791
Why does it have to be?

1038
01:00:03,083 --> 01:00:04,333
[exhales]

1039
01:00:06,125 --> 01:00:12,041
This trip just, uh... just unfolded
a lot differently than I'd imagined.

1040
01:00:12,125 --> 01:00:14,833
Yeah. It would suck if it's our last one.

1041
01:00:15,666 --> 01:00:17,166
What makes you say that?

1042
01:00:20,083 --> 01:00:22,333
My dad wants to sell the business.

1043
01:00:22,416 --> 01:00:25,166
An American company is interested.

1044
01:00:26,375 --> 01:00:29,458
No one knows, not even Sinh.

1045
01:00:32,458 --> 01:00:34,833
But, um, shouldn't he know?

1046
01:00:35,541 --> 01:00:37,750
I'll tell him after the tour ends.

1047
01:00:37,833 --> 01:00:40,166
Tomorrow's too big of a day.

1048
01:00:41,375 --> 01:00:42,375

01:12:52,083 --> 01:12:54,625
Just... Just... think about it, okay?

1219
01:12:58,041 --> 01:12:59,708
- John is what?
- [Amanda] <i>Here.</i>

1220
01:12:59,791 --> 01:13:02,041
As in like, here-here.

1221
01:13:02,125 --> 01:13:06,625
[gasps] This is all such
a super swoon-worthy moment.

1222
01:13:06,708 --> 01:13:08,333
I guess it is kind of romantic.

1223
01:13:08,416 --> 01:13:09,541
<i>You guess?</i>

1224
01:13:09,625 --> 01:13:12,541
That's not
the heart-fluttering answer I expected.

1225
01:13:12,625 --> 01:13:14,000
Yes, because...

1226
01:13:15,291 --> 01:13:17,500
because I met someone else. Sinh.

1227
01:13:17,583 --> 01:13:19,458
Ah! This story finally got good.

1228
01:13:19,541 --> 01:13:22,041
Not that it was boring before,
but it was, you know,

1229
01:13:22,125 --> 01:13:25,333
your average, "My friend got dumped
and went on a vacation" story.

1230
01:13:25,416 --> 01:13:30,166
But now it's you and two hot men
in a love triangle, and it's in Vietnam.

1231
01:13:30,250 --> 01:13:32,791
Okay, I feel like you're getting
slightly carried away.

1232
01:13:32,875 --> 01:13:35,125
It's just a way more fun story to tell.

1233
01:13:35,208 --> 01:13:37,958
Not that I'm telling anyone.
At least anyone that you know.

1234
01:13:38,041 --> 01:13:39,083
What are you gonna do?

1235
01:13:39,166 --> 01:13:41,458
I'm... I don't know.

1236
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:45,250
I mean, Sinh is just...
He's so adventurous and exciting.

1237
01:13:45,333 --> 01:13:48,208
But John and I
are just so comfortable together.

1238
01:13:48,291 --> 01:13:50,791
<i>- Boring.</i>
- And Sinh lives in Vietnam,

1239
01:13:50,875 --> 01:13:54,666
John lives in Ohio,
which is, I guess, still the same country.

1240
01:13:54,750 --> 01:13:56,291
- Is it?
<i>- John and I were together</i>

1241
01:13:56,375 --> 01:13:57,750
for such a long time,

1242
01:13:57,833 --> 01:14:00,458
and what if Sinh's
just a vacation romance, you know?

1243
01:14:00,541 --> 01:14:02,166
Not a real-life one.

1244
01:14:02,250 --> 01:14:05,000
Let alone what he might think
when he finds out what I'm doing here.

1245
01:14:05,083 --> 01:14:09,166
Speaking of, I submitted our proposal
for Saigon Silver Star Tours.

1246
01:14:09,250 --> 01:14:13,750
Okay, wait, so is that why
you're in the office at 2:00 a.m.?

1247
01:14:13,833 --> 01:14:17,958
My God, yes, you know that I live here.
The security guard calls me Mom.

1248
01:14:18,041 --> 01:14:19,250
Okay, "Mom."

1249
01:14:19,333 --> 01:14:22,291
Tell me when the Saigon Silver Star deal
goes through, okay?

1250
01:14:22,375 --> 01:14:24,166
<i>We are the right company for them.</i>

1251
01:14:24,250 --> 01:14:26,583
<i>If </i>it goes through, will do.

1252
01:14:26,666 --> 01:14:27,666
Right.

1253
01:14:28,125 --> 01:14:30,625
<i>Good luck out there.
I'll talk to you soon.</i>

1254
01:14:30,708 --> 01:14:31,833
[exhales]

1255
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:44,583
Water puppetry has a long history
in Vietnam, going back centuries.

1256
01:14:44,666 --> 01:14:46,333
When rice fields would flood,

1257
01:14:46,416 --> 01:14:49,541
the villagers would put on puppet shows
to entertain themselves.

1258
01:14:49,625 --> 01:14:52,333
Oh! Sinh, right?

1259
01:14:52,416 --> 01:14:55,250
Yeah, you guys know so much about Vietnam.

1260
01:14:55,333 --> 01:14:58,000
I know nothing about Los Angeles.

1261
01:14:58,083 --> 01:14:59,250
It's literally our job.

1262
01:14:59,875 --> 01:15:01,000
What's your line of work?

1263
01:15:01,083 --> 01:15:02,208
Ah, uh...

1264
01:15:02,291 --> 01:15:05,208
Forensic accounting. It's, uh...
It's complicated.

1265
01:15:05,291 --> 01:15:08,083
You use accounting
to investigate fraud and embezzlement,

1266
01:15:08,166 --> 01:15:11,500
and to analyze financial information
for use in legal proceedings.

1267
01:15:11,583 --> 01:15:13,958
See? So not that complicated after all.

1268
01:15:14,041 --> 01:15:15,041
Okay, let's go.

1269
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:16,250
Okay.

1270
01:15:16,333 --> 01:15:17,541
Thank you, Sinh.

1271
01:15:20,458 --> 01:15:21,458
Hey.

1272
01:15:22,625 --> 01:15:24,833
I just want to explain about John.

1273
01:15:24,916 --> 01:15:26,541
You owe me no explanation.

1274
01:15:26,625 --> 01:15:28,000
We kissed, so I do.

1275
01:15:29,416 --> 01:15:30,416
We did kiss.

1276
01:15:32,000 --> 01:15:33,375
It meant something to me.

1277
01:15:33,458 --> 01:15:34,708
To me too.

1278
01:15:34,791 --> 01:15:37,476
So you can imagine why I'm a little
thrown by the arrival of your ex.

1279
01:15:37,500 --> 01:15:38,875
That makes two of us.

1280
01:15:38,958 --> 01:15:40,958
[sighs]

1281
01:15:43,125 --> 01:15:44,416
The show's starting.

1282
01:15:45,166 --> 01:15:46,166
Let's go sit.

1283
01:15:51,000 --> 01:15:53,791
[traditional music playing]

1284
01:15:57,333 --> 01:15:59,041
[chuckling]

1285
01:16:11,708 --> 01:16:14,291
[audience applauds]

1286
01:16:17,000 --> 01:16:19,500
[traditional music continues]

1287
01:16:50,041 --> 01:16:53,458
[audience applauds and cheers]

1288
01:17:01,208 --> 01:17:03,625
[Maya] I loved the fire and the dragons.

1289
01:17:03,708 --> 01:17:05,541
I don't know how they do that!

1290
01:17:05,625 --> 01:17:07,291
Those puppeteers were brilliant!

1291
01:17:07,375 --> 01:17:11,541
Oh, it was so beautiful,
and the music was wonderful, wasn't it?

1292
01:17:11,625 --> 01:17:13,416
- Yes!
- Baby, have you tried this?

1293
01:17:13,500 --> 01:17:15,708
Oh my God. That is amazing.

1294
01:17:15,791 --> 01:17:18,500
- Oh, okay, that looks good.
- Oh, it's good.

1295
01:17:18,583 --> 01:17:21,125
...eating like this when I already do feel...

1296
01:17:22,541 --> 01:17:24,291
I'm not gonna puke or anything.

1297
01:17:24,916 --> 01:17:25,916
Okay.

1298
01:17:26,333 --> 01:17:27,750
[Alex] Oh, it's been amazing...

1299
01:17:27,833 --> 01:17:29,125
Sinh.

1300
01:17:29,208 --> 01:17:30,583
Sinh?

1301
01:17:30,666 --> 01:17:32,791
My dad sold the tour company.

1302
01:17:32,875 --> 01:17:34,791
Your dad sold Saigon Silver Star?

1303
01:17:36,291 --> 01:17:37,500
To who?

1304
01:17:37,583 --> 01:17:41,083
An American company called Tourista?

1305
01:17:41,166 --> 01:17:42,291
Ah...!

1306
01:17:42,375 --> 01:17:45,333
Amanda, why didn't you tell me?

1307
01:17:46,041 --> 01:17:47,125
Why would she know?

1308
01:17:50,416 --> 01:17:51,250
Uh...

1309
01:17:51,333 --> 01:17:52,875
- I'm sorry. No, I'm...
- I'm...

1310
01:17:54,333 --> 01:17:56,666
[Amanda] Uh... [clears throat]

1311
01:17:56,750 --> 01:17:58,083
I'm a...

1312
01:17:59,375 --> 01:18:01,750
I'm a travel executive with Tourista,

1313
01:18:01,833 --> 01:18:04,125
and it is not what it looks like.

1314
01:18:04,208 --> 01:18:06,208
I mean, it is, but it's not,

1315
01:18:06,291 --> 01:18:08,666
and also, I can explain, all right? So...

1316
01:18:09,875 --> 01:18:11,541
Sinh? Sinh.

1317
01:18:12,750 --> 01:18:15,000
Sinh! Sinh!

1318
01:18:16,500 --> 01:18:18,458
So this was all just business?

1319
01:18:18,541 --> 01:18:20,291
Sure, it started that way,

1320
01:18:20,375 --> 01:18:23,291
it did, but I had the trip of a lifetime.

1321
01:18:23,375 --> 01:18:25,791
And all I want
is for other people to experience that.

1322
01:18:25,875 --> 01:18:28,666
Why would I believe
anything you say now? Huh?

1323
01:18:30,416 --> 01:18:33,750
- I feel like such an idiot.
- No, no, I am the idiot. I am the idiot.

1324
01:18:33,833 --> 01:18:35,666
I wanted to come clean and tell you,

1325
01:18:35,750 --> 01:18:38,250
- but I didn't know if it was gonna happen.
- Stop.

1326
01:18:39,000 --> 01:18:40,000
Just stop.

1327
01:18:42,833 --> 01:18:44,250
What does it matter now?

1328
01:18:48,666 --> 01:18:49,666
[gasps]

1329
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:56,041
[bittersweet music playing]

1330
01:18:57,750 --> 01:19:00,500
[John] I mean,
aside from the Tourista drama,

1331
01:19:00,583 --> 01:19:02,291
last night was so much fun.

1332
01:19:02,375 --> 01:19:06,166
You know, the puppets and the crazy food
on the tiny little chairs.

1333
01:19:06,250 --> 01:19:09,875
Everything's so authentic
and adorable here.

1334
01:19:10,416 --> 01:19:13,583
But the best part was being here with you,

1335
01:19:14,666 --> 01:19:17,708
which is lucky for me

1336
01:19:18,250 --> 01:19:21,250
because Reed only needs me
'til the end of the year.

1337
01:19:22,041 --> 01:19:25,333
So, we just do long-distance 'til then,

1338
01:19:25,416 --> 01:19:26,625
I'm back in LA,

1339
01:19:26,708 --> 01:19:31,708
and we can start... looking for houses

1340
01:19:31,791 --> 01:19:33,916
like you, uh... like you keep wanting to.

1341
01:19:34,833 --> 01:19:35,958
House hunting?

1342
01:19:36,583 --> 01:19:39,875
I think that's quite a turnaround,
because two weeks ago,

1343
01:19:39,958 --> 01:19:42,833
- you were excited to be on a hiatus.
- [scoffs]

1344
01:19:43,833 --> 01:19:44,666
Yeah, no, I...

1345
01:19:44,750 --> 01:19:48,208
Look... I mean,
I would pay a fortune to take that back.

1346
01:19:48,291 --> 01:19:51,500
But you can't and you shouldn't because

1347
01:19:52,416 --> 01:19:53,791
we are where we are.

1348
01:19:53,875 --> 01:19:54,875
Exactly.

1349
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:55,916
Here.

1350
01:19:56,708 --> 01:20:01,166
It's funny, I think I was so horrified
by the idea of marriage

1351
01:20:01,250 --> 01:20:06,083
that I ran all the way to Ohio
just to avoid it, but then I realized,

1352
01:20:06,166 --> 01:20:09,458
if it's that important to you,
I should be willing to make the sacrifice.

1353
01:20:09,541 --> 01:20:11,916
But it shouldn't be a sacrifice, John.

1354
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:15,541
Look, if you wanted to be with me,
it wouldn't even feel like a compromise.

1355
01:20:15,625 --> 01:20:18,833
Hell, if you wanted to be with me,
you would have asked me to move to Ohio.

1356
01:20:23,625 --> 01:20:24,625
Look.

1357
01:20:26,166 --> 01:20:28,000
When you left, I was lost.

1358
01:20:29,000 --> 01:20:31,958
I was so comfortable
in our little corner of the world

1359
01:20:32,041 --> 01:20:34,375
that I never bothered
to look around outside of it.

1360
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:40,958
And as deeply corny as it sounds,
this trip has shown me that

1361
01:20:42,208 --> 01:20:44,125
I wasn't actually lost, I just...

1362
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,625
I just wasn't where I was supposed to be.

1363
01:20:49,416 --> 01:20:50,666
[exhales]

1364
01:20:52,833 --> 01:20:53,833
It's, uh...

1365
01:20:56,125 --> 01:20:59,708
This feels like
it could have been an email.

1366
01:20:59,791 --> 01:21:01,041
[Amanda chuckles]

1367
01:21:02,916 --> 01:21:05,000
Possibly, yeah, but, uh...

1368
01:21:06,458 --> 01:21:10,125
[sighs] You know, I'm...
I'm so glad you're here.

1369
01:21:10,208 --> 01:21:11,708
I really am, truly,

1370
01:21:11,791 --> 01:21:15,875
because I don't wanna have
this conversation with you through a door

1371
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:21,583
or over email because five years
deserves better than that.

1372
01:21:22,916 --> 01:21:23,916
Yeah.

1373
01:21:24,958 --> 01:21:25,958
Yeah, it does.

1374
01:21:30,125 --> 01:21:30,958
[sighs]

1375
01:21:31,041 --> 01:21:32,416
Okay. Uh...

1376
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:35,500
I, uh... I should...

1377
01:21:36,958 --> 01:21:38,958
probably book a flight home,

1378
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:41,541
and fast, you know,

1379
01:21:41,625 --> 01:21:45,916
before I'm sitting in the middle seat
for 20 hours.

1380
01:21:50,083 --> 01:21:53,500
[gentle music playing]

1381
01:21:57,333 --> 01:21:58,583
You take care, John.

1382
01:21:59,250 --> 01:22:00,333
You too.

1383
01:22:22,208 --> 01:22:26,500
I'm sorry I didn't tell you before
about my dad selling the company.

1384
01:22:29,208 --> 01:22:31,000
Are you mad at me?

1385
01:22:35,875 --> 01:22:38,458
Look, I was chicken.

1386
01:22:39,875 --> 01:22:41,333
That's not like you.

1387
01:22:41,416 --> 01:22:43,125
I worry about my job too.

Okay.

1396
01:23:22,208 --> 01:23:26,250
[in Vietnamese] I thought the new year
would bring meaningful changes, but...

1397
01:23:31,958 --> 01:23:36,291
I need to go... clear my head.

1398
01:23:39,791 --> 01:23:40,791

but this is the best trip
you've ever taken?

1407

<i>Yes!</i>

1408
01:24:09,583 --> 01:24:10,958
By far.

1409
01:24:11,041 --> 01:24:15,666
I just... I felt like I was truly
in the middle of it all, you know?

1410
01:24:15,750 --> 01:24:19,583
Like we had a very authentic
cultural experience,

1411
01:24:19,666 --> 01:24:23,708
and I could tell the entire tour group
felt the same way. We were...

1412
01:24:24,458 --> 01:24:26,791
We were changed, we were connected by it,

1413
01:24:26,875 --> 01:24:30,458
and I... I just know
that our clients will feel the same.

[exhales] That sounds perfect.

1417
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:42,625

1418
01:24:42,708 --> 01:24:44,125

1419
01:24:44,208 --> 01:24:45,583

But what I really wanna know is,

1423
01:24:51,416 --> 01:24:55,166
now that John's out of the picture,
what's the deal with your tour guide?

1424
01:24:56,500 --> 01:24:58,333
That's what I'm gonna find out.

1425
01:24:58,416 --> 01:25:00,208
I will keep you posted.

01:25:06,125 --> 01:25:08,666
[Anh] You guys have a free hour
before we head to the airport,

1428
01:25:08,750 --> 01:25:11,458
so stay safe and I'll meet you all here.

Sorry, where's Sinh?

1430
01:25:14,958 --> 01:25:17,833
He left. He needed to get away.

1431
01:25:18,750 --> 01:25:19,916
Where did he go?

1432
01:25:20,000 --> 01:25:21,875
- To be with his dad.
- What?

1433
01:25:21,958 --> 01:25:26,791
He's taking the overnight sleeper bus,
but... he left this for you.
