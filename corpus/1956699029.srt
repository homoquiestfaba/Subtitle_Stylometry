1
00:01:48,360 --> 00:01:49,360
NOW!

2
00:02:09,960 --> 00:02:12,720
- Come on!
- Yes!

3
00:02:34,640 --> 00:02:35,880
Coming!

4
00:02:38,920 --> 00:02:41,040
Whoo!

5
00:02:52,640 --> 00:02:53,920
That's not fair!

6
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:00,320
Wait!

7
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:02,640
Whoo!

8
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,240
Whoa!

9
00:03:13,960 --> 00:03:14,920
Whoo!

10
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,200
Oh!

11
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:19,600
Look out!

12
00:03:19,640 --> 00:03:21,240
Whoo!

13
00:03:23,360 --> 00:03:24,920
Whoo!

14
00:03:25,800 --> 00:03:26,760
Ha, ha, ha!

15
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:29,280
Bloody hell!

16
00:03:42,840 --> 00:03:44,040
Hey, where did Ted go?

17
00:03:44,080 --> 00:03:45,600
Hey,
you really cleaned up, huh?

18
00:03:45,640 --> 00:03:47,800
Hey, Josh, give this one a shot.

19
00:03:47,840 --> 00:03:50,280
I wrapped this one myself.

20
00:03:52,160 --> 00:03:53,280
What is it, Uncle Vince?

21
00:03:53,320 --> 00:03:56,920
This is a high-frequency,
long-range radio.

22
00:03:56,960 --> 00:03:58,720
I'm gonna have one
on board the 'QEII' myself.

23
00:03:58,760 --> 00:03:59,920
The rest of the ship's

24
00:03:59,960 --> 00:04:01,240
gonna be under complete
communication blackout.

25
00:04:01,280 --> 00:04:04,200
That means no emails,
no faxes, no cell phones.

26
00:04:04,240 --> 00:04:06,160
But you and me, bud -
we're gonna be able to talk

27
00:04:06,200 --> 00:04:08,520
because I got special permission
from the President herself.

28
00:04:08,560 --> 00:04:09,520
Wow! That's great!

29
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:12,040
Why the blackout?

30
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:14,600
President Shaw doesn't want
to turn this into a media circus

31
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:17,600
and run the risk of somebody
leaking details of the summit.

32
00:04:17,640 --> 00:04:19,840
But you arranged a way
to stay in touch with Joshua?

33
00:04:19,880 --> 00:04:20,960
Vince Kellogg!

34
00:04:21,000 --> 00:04:22,760
Bending the rules?

35
00:04:22,800 --> 00:04:24,360
Gotta know how
the Orioles are doing, right?

36
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,160
I can't believe you did that.

37
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,080
Well, I made it, didn't I?

38
00:04:29,120 --> 00:04:30,040
You could have killed yourself.

39
00:04:30,080 --> 00:04:32,360
And miss this great party?
No way.

40
00:04:33,320 --> 00:04:34,880
I didn't know Thomas was coming.

41
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:37,120
He's in town for a briefing.

42
00:04:38,680 --> 00:04:40,400
Be nice.

43
00:04:40,440 --> 00:04:41,560
Always.

44
00:04:41,600 --> 00:04:43,560
Hello, beautiful.
Hello, beautiful yourself.

45
00:04:45,200 --> 00:04:47,480
Oooh. Good to see you.

46
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,040
Ah, this is Brittany Cooper.

47
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:51,160
Brittany,
my sister-in-law Kelly.

48
00:04:51,200 --> 00:04:53,240
Hello.
Nice to meet you.

49
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,800
Brittany is head of security
for the 'QEII'.

50
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,520
I've been bomb-sweeping
that ship all week.

51
00:04:57,560 --> 00:04:59,880
Well, then, you're in good
hands. Thomas is the best.

52
00:04:59,920 --> 00:05:01,200
Yes, so he keeps telling me.

53
00:05:01,240 --> 00:05:02,600
They don't make you
special agent

54
00:05:02,640 --> 00:05:04,120
in charge of New York
for nothing.

55
00:05:05,080 --> 00:05:06,800
Brittany came down with me
for the briefing.

56
00:05:06,840 --> 00:05:09,120
I just figured
she could use a little R and R.

57
00:05:09,160 --> 00:05:10,440
Well, if chocolate cake
and touch football

58
00:05:10,480 --> 00:05:11,960
are your idea of R and R,

59
00:05:12,000 --> 00:05:13,120
you've come
to the right place.

60
00:05:13,160 --> 00:05:15,200
Chocolate cake sounds wonderful

61
00:05:15,240 --> 00:05:16,960
but, ah, your football
is so different from ours.

62
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:18,880
You're going to
have to explain the rules to me.

63
00:05:18,920 --> 00:05:20,320
No, I won't.

64
00:05:20,360 --> 00:05:21,920
The way football is played
around here, there ARE no rules.

65
00:05:21,960 --> 00:05:25,200
Oh, I see.
You have a beautiful home.

66
00:05:25,240 --> 00:05:27,400
It belonged to Thomas's parents.

67
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:28,800
He and his brothers inherited it

68
00:05:28,840 --> 00:05:31,360
and I am the lucky one
who gets to live here.

69
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:32,560
I hate to be a bother,

70
00:05:32,600 --> 00:05:34,400
but I actually did bring
a proper party dress.

71
00:05:34,440 --> 00:05:35,440
Follow me.

72
00:05:35,480 --> 00:05:36,920
- I got it!
- My turn!

73
00:05:36,960 --> 00:05:38,920
- Hey, Dean, play nice!
- Looks ready.

74
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,200
Hey!
Hey, buddy.

75
00:05:40,240 --> 00:05:41,680
Uncle Thomas.

76
00:05:41,720 --> 00:05:44,920
What do you say we throw this
on the pile?

77
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,080
Oh, thanks.

78
00:05:47,880 --> 00:05:49,760
Alright,
they're just about done.

79
00:05:49,800 --> 00:05:52,520
Hey, Vince. How ya doing?

80
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:56,520
Want a beer?

81
00:05:57,480 --> 00:05:59,040
Thought you'd never ask.

82
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:19,320
The infamous Kellogg brothers.

83
00:06:21,520 --> 00:06:22,480
That's Jack.

84
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:26,240
My...late husband.

85
00:06:26,280 --> 00:06:28,960
It...it was taken
right after Joshua was born.

86
00:06:29,000 --> 00:06:31,280
Thomas told me
there was an accident.

87
00:06:31,320 --> 00:06:32,920
I'm so sorry.

88
00:06:35,040 --> 00:06:36,640
Jack was a great guy.

89
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:38,720
A great father.

90
00:06:40,920 --> 00:06:42,640
You must miss him very much.

91
00:06:42,680 --> 00:06:44,960
Only every day.

92
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:50,240
Is that Thad Burrows?

93
00:06:50,280 --> 00:06:52,200
Yep.

94
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:55,960
Josh's favorite.
He's seen this one seven times.

95
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:57,760
He's already pre-ordered
the DVD.

96
00:06:57,800 --> 00:06:59,680
Then he must be thrilled
about the Summit at Sea.

97
00:06:59,720 --> 00:07:01,240
You have no idea.

98
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,280
I mean, Uncle Vince guards the
President every day - big deal!

99
00:07:04,320 --> 00:07:06,520
He's gonna cross the ocean
with Thad Burrows.

100
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,760
Mmm.
Now, that's cool.

101
00:07:08,800 --> 00:07:10,040
So, how about you?

102
00:07:10,080 --> 00:07:11,600
Looking forward to the trip?

103
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,400
Sure. It'll be a nice
change of pace.

104
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:16,120
I make the New York-Southampton
run every month, so...

105
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:19,000
Oh. Well, a lot more
to worry about on THIS crossing.

106
00:07:19,040 --> 00:07:22,000
Yes, but a lot fewer people.

107
00:07:23,640 --> 00:07:25,560
Look, I just don't think
it's a good idea

108
00:07:25,600 --> 00:07:27,080
to get into bed with China.

109
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:29,520
President Shaw's not
getting into bed with anyone.

110
00:07:29,560 --> 00:07:31,280
Too bad. That would be
an interesting trip.

111
00:07:31,320 --> 00:07:33,480
You just don't like the
President because she's a woman.

112
00:07:33,520 --> 00:07:34,560
No.

113
00:07:34,600 --> 00:07:36,080
And I worry about her
pushing for policies

114
00:07:36,120 --> 00:07:37,360
that'll put the country at risk.

115
00:07:37,400 --> 00:07:39,680
So you want to remain
at a stalemate with China

116
00:07:39,720 --> 00:07:41,040
and just hope for the best.

117
00:07:41,080 --> 00:07:43,000
But Global Zero Alert, Vince?

118
00:07:43,040 --> 00:07:44,920
See, I don't even understand
what that means.

119
00:07:44,960 --> 00:07:46,800
It means that our missiles
and China's

120
00:07:46,840 --> 00:07:48,640
will be sitting in their silos
unarmed,

121
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,240
without nuclear warheads.

122
00:07:50,280 --> 00:07:52,600
The theory being that
the time it takes to re-arm them

123
00:07:52,640 --> 00:07:54,960
could be crucial minutes that
we need to avert a catastrophe.

124
00:07:55,000 --> 00:07:56,480
That's assuming that China
hasn't broken the treaty

125
00:07:56,520 --> 00:07:57,440
and armed theirs already.

126
00:07:57,480 --> 00:07:59,400
Come on, Vince.
What about Taiwan?

127
00:07:59,440 --> 00:08:01,040
We run the risk
of leaving it unprotected

128
00:08:01,080 --> 00:08:02,920
or worse,
offering it up as a pawn

129
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,240
to get them to sign the treaty.

130
00:08:04,280 --> 00:08:06,040
All the President intends
on doing on this cruise

131
00:08:06,080 --> 00:08:08,120
is getting to know President Wu
and kicking around some ideas.

132
00:08:08,160 --> 00:08:09,280
That's it.

133
00:08:09,320 --> 00:08:10,800
Since when did becoming
a Secret Service agent

134
00:08:10,840 --> 00:08:12,840
mean that you had to agree
with the President's policies?

135
00:08:12,880 --> 00:08:14,080
Since when did being
an ATF agent

136
00:08:14,120 --> 00:08:15,280
make you an expert
on geopolitics?

137
00:08:15,320 --> 00:08:16,280
Heads up!

138
00:08:18,920 --> 00:08:20,400
Hey, sorry, guys.

139
00:08:22,360 --> 00:08:23,760
It's great. Thanks.

140
00:08:23,800 --> 00:08:26,040
Is this what you looked like
when YOU were a paratrooper?

141
00:08:26,080 --> 00:08:28,800
No. I looked 10 times cooler
than that.

142
00:08:28,840 --> 00:08:30,400
Come on.

143
00:08:30,440 --> 00:08:32,320
Let's play some football!
You're on!

144
00:09:11,720 --> 00:09:13,280
It's only a game, you guys!

145
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:16,200
Are they always
this competitive?

146
00:09:25,960 --> 00:09:27,840
Hey! Hey!

147
00:09:32,360 --> 00:09:34,160
Get off!
It's a game! It's a game!

148
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:46,040
Thomas.

149
00:09:47,000 --> 00:09:49,360
Forget the bungee cords.
The bikes fit the rack.

150
00:09:50,760 --> 00:09:52,280
Look at this.

151
00:09:53,240 --> 00:09:55,280
We all made Eagle Scout, see?

152
00:09:55,320 --> 00:09:59,240
That's Vince -
he earned this first.

153
00:09:59,280 --> 00:10:03,120
And then he handed it to me.

154
00:10:03,160 --> 00:10:05,160
And I passed it onto Jack.

155
00:10:08,400 --> 00:10:10,360
It's tough to become
an Eagle Scout.

156
00:10:10,400 --> 00:10:11,560
You've gotta go the distance.

157
00:10:17,240 --> 00:10:20,480
About six years ago, I, um...

158
00:10:20,520 --> 00:10:21,600
..I took up rock climbing.

159
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:26,240
It's just a way to burn off
tension, stay in shape.

160
00:10:27,880 --> 00:10:29,960
Jack -
he got interested in it too.

161
00:10:31,160 --> 00:10:33,240
We would go out
together.

162
00:10:33,280 --> 00:10:34,960
It was...it was a blast.

163
00:10:37,920 --> 00:10:39,880
Only he wasn't as well-trained
as I was.

164
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:42,280
I don't know, I...

165
00:10:43,680 --> 00:10:47,720
I didn't do a real good job
bringing him up to speed.

166
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,360
I mean, not that he would have
listened. He was a Kellogg.

167
00:10:50,400 --> 00:10:52,160
You can't tell us
anything.

168
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,880
You know the funny thing
about falling is...

169
00:10:57,240 --> 00:10:58,840
..it happens so fast.

170
00:11:00,520 --> 00:11:01,960
And when the rope catches you,

171
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,880
sure, it's like
nothing ever happened.

172
00:11:08,120 --> 00:11:10,240
Jack's rope never caught him,
of course.

173
00:11:12,560 --> 00:11:15,240
So...it was over quick.

174
00:11:23,360 --> 00:11:27,760
Vince...he blames me
for what happened.

175
00:11:28,680 --> 00:11:32,160
It's in case you're wondering
why he hates me so much.

176
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:50,760
Josh, I'll be back in an hour.

177
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,760
In the meantime,
Uncle Vince is the boss.

178
00:11:52,800 --> 00:11:54,400
I'll see you in New York.

179
00:11:54,440 --> 00:11:55,400
Nice to meet you both.

180
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:56,400
See you tomorrow.

181
00:12:01,600 --> 00:12:03,120
How long is it
to England?

182
00:12:03,160 --> 00:12:04,320
About a week.

183
00:12:04,360 --> 00:12:05,600
You coming right back?

184
00:12:05,640 --> 00:12:07,800
Yep. Someone's got
a Little League game next week.

185
00:12:07,840 --> 00:12:09,200
I can't miss that, can I?

186
00:12:09,240 --> 00:12:10,560
You gonna win?
Yeah.

187
00:12:20,520 --> 00:12:22,240
That was a wonderful day,
Thomas.

188
00:12:22,280 --> 00:12:24,240
I'm really glad you invited me.

189
00:12:24,280 --> 00:12:27,720
Burgers, beer, ball -
America at its finest.

190
00:12:27,760 --> 00:12:29,920
And don't forget
that chocolate cake.

191
00:12:29,960 --> 00:12:31,240
Ahh.

192
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:33,520
You know, the night
is still young.

193
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:37,600
Well, we have an early flight
back to New York and...

194
00:12:37,640 --> 00:12:39,800
Yeah. We could order up
some room service, you know?

195
00:12:39,840 --> 00:12:42,120
Just...a light supper.

196
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:43,560
A bottle of wine.

197
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:45,120
Huge day tomorrow.

198
00:12:45,160 --> 00:12:46,800
Put on
some Barry White.

199
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,640
Barry White?

200
00:12:48,680 --> 00:12:50,720
Or Ozzy Osbourne.

201
00:12:50,760 --> 00:12:52,400
Whatever rings your bell.

202
00:12:54,520 --> 00:12:56,160
Aren't we
a little old for this?

203
00:12:56,200 --> 00:12:58,160
For what?

204
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,960
One-night stands.

205
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:07,280
Who says first nights
have to be only nights?

206
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:11,320
Reality says.

207
00:13:11,360 --> 00:13:13,840
I sail for London tomorrow.

208
00:13:17,400 --> 00:13:19,120
Who knows if we'll ever even...

209
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,840
..see each other again?

210
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,920
Hey, is this the last one?

211
00:14:13,880 --> 00:14:15,280
Hey.

212
00:14:15,320 --> 00:14:16,880
Yo! Hey!

213
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:23,400
What's your name?

214
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:27,160
Thad! You're about to embark
on an historic journey, Thad -

215
00:14:27,200 --> 00:14:29,080
the Summit at Sea.

216
00:14:29,120 --> 00:14:30,960
How are you feeling right now?
Humble.

217
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,000
And helping you conduct
your martial arts classes

218
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:34,440
on the crossing

219
00:14:34,480 --> 00:14:37,840
will be the latest Burrows girl,
Monica Chang.

220
00:14:37,880 --> 00:14:39,760
So tell me,
are the rumors true?

221
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:41,920
A gentleman never kisses
and tells.

222
00:14:41,960 --> 00:14:45,360
How about you, Monica?
Any secrets you'd like to share?

223
00:14:45,400 --> 00:14:47,080
No. No secrets.

224
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,960
Are you excited about
the crossing?

225
00:14:49,000 --> 00:14:50,360
Hmm, yes.

226
00:14:50,400 --> 00:14:52,640
I'm just so grateful that Thad
invited me to join him.

227
00:14:52,680 --> 00:14:55,800
When you think about it, you and
Thad are truly representative

228
00:14:55,840 --> 00:14:57,120
of this summit, aren't you?

229
00:14:57,160 --> 00:15:01,520
The two powers coming together -
America and China.

230
00:15:01,560 --> 00:15:03,680
Actually, I'm from Taiwan.

231
00:15:05,120 --> 00:15:06,200
Of course.

232
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:10,200
The Burrows party is here
finally.

233
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:11,600
I just heard.

234
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,240
And they're about two minutes
ahead of the President.

235
00:15:38,320 --> 00:15:40,080
Thad Burrows
got a better reception.

236
00:15:40,120 --> 00:15:43,040
President!
President Shaw, over here!

237
00:15:52,400 --> 00:15:53,400
Thank you.

238
00:15:54,360 --> 00:15:56,720
Mr Saunders.
Thanks.

239
00:15:56,760 --> 00:15:59,000
Mr Hart.
Packing manifest, please.

240
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:01,560
There you go.
Thank you.

241
00:16:01,600 --> 00:16:04,200
That's Thad's gear for the class
- gym equipment, mats.

242
00:16:04,240 --> 00:16:05,160
Mm-hm.

243
00:16:05,200 --> 00:16:06,280
You pack these yourselves?
Yeah.

244
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:08,960
Is that why you're
an hour and a half late?

245
00:16:09,000 --> 00:16:10,440
We weren't late. The van was.

246
00:16:10,480 --> 00:16:11,800
The van was late.

247
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,480
Yeah, we waited over an hour
for it.

248
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:16,680
Driver call in?
Report any delays?

249
00:16:16,720 --> 00:16:19,320
No. Where is the driver?

250
00:16:32,960 --> 00:16:35,920
Madam President, Mr President,
welcome.

251
00:16:35,960 --> 00:16:39,040
I'm Captain Young,
master of the 'Queen'.

252
00:16:47,280 --> 00:16:50,280
We're using only a few
dozen of the ship's 779 cabins

253
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:51,720
for the summit.

254
00:16:51,760 --> 00:16:55,560
The lower decks are completely
unoccupied...and off-limits.

255
00:16:56,560 --> 00:16:59,720
The whole ship to ourselves -
I feel like Eloise.

256
00:17:06,040 --> 00:17:07,720
The banquet will be here.

257
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:10,360
Our chefs are preparing
a fabulous feast.

258
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:13,080
Oh, darn.
I'm on a diet.

259
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,800
Sorry. No dieting allowed
on the 'Queen'.

260
00:17:29,680 --> 00:17:31,600
Heel. Heel.

261
00:17:59,720 --> 00:18:02,680
You must take a step back!

262
00:18:02,720 --> 00:18:03,880
Let's go! Move it!

263
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,720
Come on! Take it back!

264
00:18:42,520 --> 00:18:43,480
Oooh!

265
00:19:17,560 --> 00:19:19,520
Mike, anything new to report?

266
00:19:19,560 --> 00:19:22,960
We've cleared the two guys
who came in on the van.

267
00:19:23,000 --> 00:19:24,240
Yeah, I heard.

268
00:19:24,280 --> 00:19:26,480
The whole point of the bomb
was to scare me off,

269
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:28,240
and I'm not going to be.

270
00:19:28,280 --> 00:19:30,720
We sail as planned.
Yes, ma'am.

271
00:19:30,760 --> 00:19:32,400
This is Michael Galloway,
Mrs President.

272
00:19:32,440 --> 00:19:34,240
He's heading up
the FBI investigation.

273
00:19:34,280 --> 00:19:35,960
If you need anything
from the White House, Mike,

274
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:37,200
anything at all, let us know.

275
00:19:37,240 --> 00:19:38,720
Thank you, Madam President.

276
00:19:40,400 --> 00:19:41,320
Which one's Thomas?

277
00:19:42,720 --> 00:19:44,160
Thomas!

278
00:19:49,880 --> 00:19:51,480
Special Agent Kellogg?

279
00:19:51,520 --> 00:19:53,320
President Shaw.

280
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,680
I wanted to thank you personally
for your bravery today.

281
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:59,520
Between you and your brother, I
might get out of this job alive.

282
00:19:59,560 --> 00:20:01,240
When I do get back from England,

283
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:03,520
I'd like you to join me
for lunch at the White House.

284
00:20:03,560 --> 00:20:05,360
Thanks.

285
00:20:05,400 --> 00:20:08,200
Well, somebody thought
they could derail this trip.

286
00:20:08,240 --> 00:20:10,320
Thanks for proving them wrong.

287
00:20:10,360 --> 00:20:12,320
OK. Let's get this show
on the road.

288
00:20:19,000 --> 00:20:20,360
If you come back in one piece,

289
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,120
you can be my date
at the White House.

290
00:20:23,120 --> 00:20:24,080
I'd like that.

291
00:20:28,280 --> 00:20:29,920
Well, this should keep you busy
for a while.

292
00:20:29,960 --> 00:20:31,520
Well, somebody has to work
for a living.

293
00:20:31,560 --> 00:20:32,920
Mm-hm.

294
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:34,880
Don't get sunburnt
lounging around the ship's pool.

295
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:36,080
It'll be hard not to do.

296
00:20:36,120 --> 00:20:37,560
I don't have a care in the world

297
00:20:37,600 --> 00:20:38,600
knowing Special Agent
Thomas Kellogg

298
00:20:38,640 --> 00:20:40,720
is on duty saving democracy.

299
00:20:42,960 --> 00:20:44,520
Catch the sonofabitch.

300
00:20:44,560 --> 00:20:45,520
I will.

301
00:20:47,520 --> 00:20:49,480
Hey.

302
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:51,000
Be careful.

303
00:20:51,040 --> 00:20:52,120
Aren't I always?

304
00:21:04,720 --> 00:21:07,080
Admiral, I have the captain
of the 'Polk' online.

305
00:21:07,120 --> 00:21:08,080
Thank you.

306
00:21:11,200 --> 00:21:14,400
Captain Cramm, Admiral Lewis
at Op Centre Bravo.

307
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:15,400
Yes, Admiral.

308
00:21:17,680 --> 00:21:18,960
Got any problems?

309
00:21:19,000 --> 00:21:20,600
So far, so good.

310
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:23,000
Let's hope we left all our
problems back in New York.

311
00:21:23,040 --> 00:21:26,960
Got that right.
Shadowing close to the 'Queen'?

312
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:30,760
Affirmative, sir.
I got my best man on sonar.

313
00:21:30,800 --> 00:21:34,280
Range, 2 Sierra 11, 6,000 yards.

314
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:37,400
FYI, there's a tropical building
near Bermuda.

315
00:21:37,440 --> 00:21:38,600
Won't come close to you,

316
00:21:38,640 --> 00:21:40,920
but it could give you
a little problem tomorrow.

317
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:41,880
I read that.

318
00:21:41,920 --> 00:21:43,240
How are my SEALs?

319
00:21:44,640 --> 00:21:46,000
Oh, they're doing just fine,
sir.

320
00:21:46,040 --> 00:21:49,480
Hoo, yeah! I got a full boat.
Jacks over fives.

321
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:51,040
Beats my straight.
You bastard...!

322
00:21:52,040 --> 00:21:53,160
..sir.

323
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:55,960
You know, if we were on
the 'QEII' right now,

324
00:21:56,000 --> 00:21:57,880
we'd be playing
in a fancy casino,

325
00:21:57,920 --> 00:21:59,280
drinking champagne,
eating caviar.

326
00:21:59,320 --> 00:22:01,680
I hate champagne.
Caviar makes me gag.

327
00:22:01,720 --> 00:22:03,680
Good, 'cause unless this lady
gets into trouble

328
00:22:03,720 --> 00:22:05,040
we're staying right here.

329
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,880
Ante up!
Next hand. Come on.

330
00:22:06,920 --> 00:22:09,280
Yeah, I just
finished my security briefing

331
00:22:09,320 --> 00:22:10,680
with the captain.

332
00:22:10,720 --> 00:22:13,280
Have you met Thad Burrows yet?
Have you talked to him?

333
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,520
No, I just shook his hand
and said hello.

334
00:22:15,560 --> 00:22:17,800
And how about President Wu?
What's he like?

335
00:22:17,840 --> 00:22:19,000
It's hard to tell.

336
00:22:19,040 --> 00:22:21,000
He and the President
seem to be hitting it off.

337
00:22:21,040 --> 00:22:22,520
Um, listen up -

338
00:22:22,560 --> 00:22:24,720
captain told me that there might
be some atmospheric disturbance

339
00:22:24,760 --> 00:22:26,320
over the next couple of days.

340
00:22:26,360 --> 00:22:27,800
What does that mean?

341
00:22:27,840 --> 00:22:30,680
It means we might have some
difficulty reaching each other.

342
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:33,320
It can interfere
with the radio transmission.

343
00:22:35,840 --> 00:22:37,560
Tagged and marked for exam,
sir.

344
00:22:43,400 --> 00:22:45,640
- The bomb's trigger?
- Yep.

345
00:22:45,680 --> 00:22:49,920
So who are we dealing with here?
Syria? Iraq?

346
00:22:50,880 --> 00:22:52,280
I think it's one of ours.

347
00:22:52,320 --> 00:22:55,080
The cleaning service found this
in the men's room trash.

348
00:22:55,120 --> 00:22:57,520
We lifted a partial
off one of the buttons.

349
00:22:59,360 --> 00:23:01,600
Cunard. Start with
the ship's crew.

350
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:10,520
Yes.
Oh.

351
00:23:20,800 --> 00:23:22,120
Who's winning?

352
00:23:22,160 --> 00:23:23,720
He is.

353
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,600
But she's letting him.

354
00:23:26,640 --> 00:23:28,920
Ping pong diplomacy.

355
00:23:28,960 --> 00:23:33,280
I wonder if he sleeps in
the same bed as President Wu?

356
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,320
Looks like Wu doesn't trust
his buddies back in Beijing

357
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:37,400
with the nuclear codes.

358
00:23:37,440 --> 00:23:38,400
Wonder why?

359
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:45,480
Hooh! Attractive woman.

360
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:49,440
They seem to be
enjoying themselves.

361
00:23:51,400 --> 00:23:52,560
Yeah.

362
00:23:55,200 --> 00:23:56,600
I thought you guys
had supercomputers.

363
00:23:56,640 --> 00:23:57,960
What's taking so long?

364
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,440
Well, remember the dark ages,
before we went online?

365
00:24:00,480 --> 00:24:02,360
You had to wait two weeks
to match a print.

366
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:05,520
Now we get a match, a photo,
rap sheet, file...

367
00:24:05,560 --> 00:24:07,120
Hell, if this print's on record

368
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:09,280
we'll find out what this guy
had for breakfast.

369
00:24:09,320 --> 00:24:12,480
And people say
the FBI's cocky.

370
00:24:17,960 --> 00:24:21,680
I am not gonna poison
President Wu's food!

371
00:24:21,720 --> 00:24:24,440
It is protocol.
I mean no offence.

372
00:24:24,480 --> 00:24:27,280
He's only following orders,
Connor. Let's resolve this!

373
00:24:27,320 --> 00:24:29,920
You have to taste everything
before we serve it?!

374
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,960
I am China's acting head chef
on this voyage.

375
00:24:33,000 --> 00:24:36,400
I must sample every dish.
It is protocol.

376
00:24:36,440 --> 00:24:37,960
Why don't you prepare
double portions?

377
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:41,400
Mr Ping will taste one and we'll
serve President Wu the other.

378
00:24:41,440 --> 00:24:42,800
Fine, if I have to.

379
00:24:42,840 --> 00:24:44,000
'Cause I'm not serving food

380
00:24:44,040 --> 00:24:45,800
what's had bites
taken out of it!

381
00:24:45,840 --> 00:24:47,920
Sorry for the misunderstanding.

382
00:24:51,360 --> 00:24:53,360
Barry Jinks.

383
00:24:53,400 --> 00:24:56,240
Ex-US Navy, dishonorably
discharged in '96

384
00:24:56,280 --> 00:24:58,360
for disseminating
anti-government literature.

385
00:24:58,400 --> 00:25:00,640
This guy's got multiple
misdemeanor arrests.

386
00:25:00,680 --> 00:25:03,080
One felony for assaulting
a federal judge.

387
00:25:03,120 --> 00:25:06,200
This guy served 18 months.
Got paroled in '99.

388
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,520
Last known address
200 Gadstone Way.

389
00:25:08,560 --> 00:25:10,840
Yeah, just north of Jersey City.
You got that?

390
00:25:10,880 --> 00:25:13,400
Good, 'cause we're on our way.

391
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:14,560
Excellent.

392
00:26:15,760 --> 00:26:17,240
If this commander-in-chief gig
doesn't pan out,

393
00:26:17,280 --> 00:26:18,520
you can come work with us.

394
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,360
Oh, the President
becoming an actor.

395
00:26:20,400 --> 00:26:21,920
Now, that's something different.

396
00:26:23,080 --> 00:26:24,440
But seriously,

397
00:26:24,480 --> 00:26:26,800
tai chi is a great introduction
to the martial arts.

398
00:26:26,840 --> 00:26:28,320
You'll find many of its moves

399
00:26:28,360 --> 00:26:31,560
incorporated into
the fighting itself.

400
00:26:31,600 --> 00:26:32,560
Monica?

401
00:26:33,800 --> 00:26:37,000
Do any of you
have martial arts experience?

402
00:26:37,040 --> 00:26:38,000
No.

403
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:41,040
No?

404
00:26:41,080 --> 00:26:42,760
I do.

405
00:26:42,800 --> 00:26:43,760
Come.

406
00:26:46,400 --> 00:26:48,520
Let us demonstrate.

407
00:27:32,440 --> 00:27:33,400
Ugh!

408
00:27:51,160 --> 00:27:52,480
China
confirmed today

409
00:27:52,520 --> 00:27:54,440
that one of their subs,
the 'Lijiang',

410
00:27:54,480 --> 00:27:55,880
has been taken
out of commission.

411
00:27:55,920 --> 00:27:58,520
That's an old vessel, but it's
not ready for the scrapyard.

412
00:27:58,560 --> 00:28:01,720
Copy that. But it's been off
our radar for over three days.

413
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,600
So what's our best guess?

414
00:28:03,640 --> 00:28:06,560
Intelligence is inconclusive
at this point.

415
00:28:06,600 --> 00:28:07,720
They could be telling the truth.

416
00:28:07,760 --> 00:28:09,520
And what are the chances
of that?

417
00:28:09,560 --> 00:28:12,520
Well, they're delaying
announcing the decommission.

418
00:28:12,560 --> 00:28:15,760
Makes us think that
the 'Lijiang' probably sank.

419
00:28:21,080 --> 00:28:24,160
Yes, but we won't be able
to talk again.

420
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:26,160
They're instituting
a communication blackout.

421
00:28:26,200 --> 00:28:28,600
Everything go as planned?

422
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:29,600
So far.

423
00:28:30,760 --> 00:28:32,120
Where are you?

424
00:28:32,160 --> 00:28:34,280
We've just completed a transit
of the Arctic ice pack,

425
00:28:34,320 --> 00:28:37,600
penetrated the Greenland straits
and entered the North Atlantic,

426
00:28:37,640 --> 00:28:39,520
where we anticipate
an on-time arrival

427
00:28:39,560 --> 00:28:42,400
at the Eckert Sea Mount
rendezvous site.

428
00:28:42,440 --> 00:28:44,320
Depth, 110 metres.

429
00:28:44,360 --> 00:28:46,280
We have the 'Lijiang'.

430
00:28:48,160 --> 00:28:49,320
And soon,
we'll have the 'Queen'.

431
00:29:03,360 --> 00:29:04,320
Hey, Mike.

432
00:29:06,280 --> 00:29:07,080
Yeah.

433
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:09,040
You awake?
Of course.

434
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,960
Good - I'd hate to see
Jinks show up

435
00:29:11,000 --> 00:29:13,160
and have the FBI
miss out on the collar.

436
00:29:13,200 --> 00:29:15,000
Don't worry. We'll be there
to grab the glory.

437
00:29:15,040 --> 00:29:16,480
IF he ever shows up.

438
00:29:22,160 --> 00:29:23,120
Hold on.

439
00:29:23,160 --> 00:29:25,000
I think we've got something.

440
00:29:33,080 --> 00:29:34,920
It's him. Get ready to move in.

441
00:30:23,080 --> 00:30:24,040
Arggh.

442
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:27,760
He's headed east for the tracks.
Cut him off.

443
00:30:35,360 --> 00:30:36,320
Go, go, go!

444
00:31:21,120 --> 00:31:22,480
- Hey...arggh!
- Hey, you!

445
00:31:25,360 --> 00:31:26,320
Hey!

446
00:31:29,280 --> 00:31:30,920
You sonofabitch!

447
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:47,520
Ah!

448
00:32:00,640 --> 00:32:02,520
No!

449
00:32:03,920 --> 00:32:04,840
Ah!

450
00:32:07,680 --> 00:32:08,680
Ah!

451
00:32:24,440 --> 00:32:25,600
Oh!

452
00:32:35,880 --> 00:32:36,840
Oh!

453
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,120
Give it up, Jinks!

454
00:33:16,040 --> 00:33:17,400
Yah!

455
00:33:17,440 --> 00:33:18,520
Gotcha. Let's go.

456
00:33:19,440 --> 00:33:21,280
I thought that
went rather well.

457
00:33:24,920 --> 00:33:26,840
Once the codes
are uplinked to satellite,

458
00:33:26,880 --> 00:33:28,480
we will rendezvous
with the 'Lijiang'.

459
00:33:28,520 --> 00:33:30,720
Here - tomorrow night.

460
00:33:30,760 --> 00:33:32,360
Assuming Blake makes it.

461
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,600
He will.

462
00:33:33,640 --> 00:33:35,720
We'll board the sub
and be on our way by dawn...

463
00:33:36,680 --> 00:33:38,880
..with China's nuclear arsenal
under our command.

464
00:33:38,920 --> 00:33:40,560
So where do we board?

465
00:33:41,520 --> 00:33:43,520
On deck 4, near the...

466
00:33:44,800 --> 00:33:46,480
Yes?

467
00:33:46,520 --> 00:33:47,680
It's me.

468
00:33:49,320 --> 00:33:50,320
Hmm.

469
00:33:56,800 --> 00:33:58,280
Hi, Thad.

470
00:33:58,320 --> 00:33:59,880
You want to go for a swim?

471
00:33:59,920 --> 00:34:01,240
Sure.

472
00:34:01,280 --> 00:34:03,240
Give me a few minutes
to change

473
00:34:03,280 --> 00:34:04,720
and I'll meet you at the pool.

474
00:34:04,760 --> 00:34:08,080
You know, I'm really glad
you could come on this trip.

475
00:34:09,040 --> 00:34:10,640
I'll be up soon.

476
00:34:10,680 --> 00:34:11,680
Yeah.

477
00:34:18,240 --> 00:34:19,800
Where were we?

478
00:34:22,120 --> 00:34:25,200
You might think you're some kind
of an international terrorist,

479
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,240
but you almost blew me up
in that van, you sonofabitch,

480
00:34:29,280 --> 00:34:31,600
and I want to know
who you're working with.

481
00:34:31,640 --> 00:34:33,280
I want to call my lawyer.

482
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,240
Not until you tell me
what I want to know!

483
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:36,560
Thomas!

484
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:38,360
I'm not gonna let him drag some
sleazbo lawyer in here

485
00:34:38,400 --> 00:34:39,360
he can hide behind.

486
00:34:39,400 --> 00:34:40,320
Thomas!

487
00:34:40,360 --> 00:34:41,600
He asked for his lawyer!

488
00:34:41,640 --> 00:34:43,240
We can't ask him
any more questions!

489
00:34:45,120 --> 00:34:46,800
But we can search his house.

490
00:34:54,360 --> 00:34:55,720
Tonight, after we have
rendezvoused

491
00:34:55,760 --> 00:34:57,080
with our compatriots

492
00:34:57,120 --> 00:34:58,880
and retrieved them
from the 'Queen',

493
00:34:58,920 --> 00:35:01,600
we will control China's
nuclear arsenal,

494
00:35:01,640 --> 00:35:05,920
making Taiwan one of the two
most powerful nations on earth.

495
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,120
Now, power
is a corrupting force -

496
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:12,360
I understand this better
than anyone -

497
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:16,320
but we are not terrorists,
we are patriots,

498
00:35:16,360 --> 00:35:19,400
and our mission is simple
and clear.

499
00:35:21,520 --> 00:35:24,400
Global Zero Alert
is a dangerous lie.

500
00:35:25,400 --> 00:35:26,640
The only way
to protect ourselves

501
00:35:26,680 --> 00:35:29,240
from China's nuclear threat

502
00:35:29,280 --> 00:35:30,800
is to destroy that threat.

503
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,000
And that is exactly what
we're going to do.

504
00:35:54,240 --> 00:35:56,880
Oh, man, I hate lead.

505
00:35:56,920 --> 00:35:59,280
Yeah, but the X-rays
can't see through it.

506
00:36:22,920 --> 00:36:23,880
Hey, Santos.

507
00:36:37,240 --> 00:36:40,720
What a pack rat.
Jinks must keep everything.

508
00:36:40,760 --> 00:36:43,240
Yeah, including every wacko
political magazine.

509
00:36:43,280 --> 00:36:45,720
Oh, man. Look at this.

510
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,400
'James Brown
Live at the Apollo.'

511
00:36:47,440 --> 00:36:48,360
Hmm.

512
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:50,760
This is a great record.

513
00:36:50,800 --> 00:36:52,360
Wow.

514
00:36:52,400 --> 00:36:55,920
This thing is mint.
It's probably worth a fortune.

515
00:36:56,880 --> 00:36:58,040
No.

516
00:36:58,080 --> 00:37:00,280
Well, a couple of hundred,
at least.

517
00:37:00,320 --> 00:37:01,640
No!

518
00:37:03,080 --> 00:37:07,080
Jinks with Monica Chang?
Oh, man.

519
00:37:10,640 --> 00:37:12,800
Are you sure you don't want
to split the shift with me?

520
00:37:12,840 --> 00:37:16,360
No. No point in both of us
not having champagne.

521
00:37:16,400 --> 00:37:19,360
Oh, champagne.
Don't even mention it.

522
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:20,760
Are you wearing a seasick patch?

523
00:37:20,800 --> 00:37:23,280
Yeah, for all the good
it's doing me.

524
00:37:23,320 --> 00:37:25,520
I know. I look fabulous.

525
00:37:43,160 --> 00:37:46,600
And I said,
"No, after you, Miss Street."

526
00:37:49,040 --> 00:37:51,120
Yes, I've often thought that
myself.

527
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,560
Well, I hate to admit it,

528
00:37:52,600 --> 00:37:55,000
but as Americans, we do tend
to ignore the rest of the world,

529
00:37:55,040 --> 00:37:56,480
as if we're the only ones
that matter.

530
00:37:56,520 --> 00:38:00,160
Well, that sensibility is not
unique to the USA, I assure you.

531
00:38:07,440 --> 00:38:08,360
Gentlemen.

532
00:38:08,400 --> 00:38:09,360
Ah, Miss.
Ma'am.

533
00:38:09,400 --> 00:38:10,440
Ah, thank you.

534
00:38:14,000 --> 00:38:15,480
Are you alright?

535
00:38:15,520 --> 00:38:18,560
Well, I'm just a little seasick.

536
00:38:18,600 --> 00:38:20,840
Are you taking anything for it?

537
00:38:20,880 --> 00:38:23,000
I'm wearing a patch.

538
00:38:23,040 --> 00:38:25,800
Follow me. The first thing
you need is some fresh air.

539
00:38:25,840 --> 00:38:26,800
Thanks.

540
00:38:32,960 --> 00:38:33,920
Pentagon.

541
00:38:43,160 --> 00:38:44,280
Those should put you right.

542
00:38:44,320 --> 00:38:45,760
The ship's pharmacy
always has them on hand.

543
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:46,840
Thanks.

544
00:38:46,880 --> 00:38:48,640
Are you on duty now?
No, not till midnight.

545
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,960
Oh, then I recommend
you rest for an hour or so.

546
00:38:51,000 --> 00:38:53,520
Those pills
are going to make you drowsy.

547
00:38:53,560 --> 00:38:54,680
That's fine with me,

548
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,400
'cause I sure as hell
don't feel like eating.

549
00:38:57,560 --> 00:38:59,640
What can I tell you?
I'm a landlubber.

550
00:39:00,600 --> 00:39:04,160
Yeah. The rest of the team's
glad to be on a cruise, but me?

551
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,680
This is my idea of hell.

552
00:39:07,120 --> 00:39:08,880
We all have one of those.

553
00:39:08,920 --> 00:39:10,680
Yeah?
Mmm.

554
00:39:10,720 --> 00:39:12,280
What's your idea of hell?

555
00:39:13,680 --> 00:39:17,200
The safe, sedate life
of a suburban housewife.

556
00:39:19,240 --> 00:39:20,600
I can relate to that.

557
00:39:22,760 --> 00:39:25,160
No domestic bliss
for you either, huh?

558
00:39:25,200 --> 00:39:26,200
No.

559
00:39:28,080 --> 00:39:30,000
I tell myself it's the job.

560
00:39:30,040 --> 00:39:31,320
This is an insane life.

561
00:39:31,360 --> 00:39:33,600
You can't ask someone else
to take it on.

562
00:39:35,360 --> 00:39:36,800
That's what I tell myself.

563
00:39:36,840 --> 00:39:37,800
Yeah.

564
00:39:43,480 --> 00:39:44,840
I'd better get back.

565
00:39:44,880 --> 00:39:46,120
Hey...

566
00:39:47,080 --> 00:39:48,040
Yes?

567
00:39:49,000 --> 00:39:50,600
Thanks for the pills.

568
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:53,160
Sure.

569
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,720
How the hell
did this woman get clearance?

570
00:39:56,760 --> 00:39:57,720
I don't know, Admiral,

571
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,240
but the 'QEII'
should be on red alert.

572
00:40:02,320 --> 00:40:04,200
Ma'am.
Thank you.

573
00:40:04,240 --> 00:40:05,240
No, please.

574
00:40:08,680 --> 00:40:11,000
You visited
Disneyland AND Disneyworld?

575
00:40:11,040 --> 00:40:12,240
It was a state tour.

576
00:40:12,280 --> 00:40:13,720
I felt it was my obligation

577
00:40:13,760 --> 00:40:16,360
to experience everything your
beautiful country has to offer.

578
00:40:16,400 --> 00:40:17,720
And? What did you think?

579
00:40:17,760 --> 00:40:19,800
I thought despite what
I have been raised to believe,

580
00:40:19,840 --> 00:40:23,720
perhaps my homeland is not
the happiest place on earth.

581
00:40:23,760 --> 00:40:26,560
Mr President, I do believe
you're pulling my leg.

582
00:40:28,760 --> 00:40:31,000
So, have you got a girl
in there, Ping?

583
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:34,320
A little girl in a kimono.

584
00:40:36,120 --> 00:40:40,160
Kimonos are Japanese.

585
00:41:07,120 --> 00:41:10,840
The 'QEII'
has been the temporary home

586
00:41:10,880 --> 00:41:14,720
of scores of world leaders and
other passengers of distinction

587
00:41:14,760 --> 00:41:17,560
in her long, luminous life,

588
00:41:17,600 --> 00:41:20,440
but she has never been
as honored

589
00:41:20,480 --> 00:41:23,240
as she is
on this historic voyage.

590
00:41:48,760 --> 00:41:53,880
We are proud to have been asked
to host this meeting of minds

591
00:41:53,920 --> 00:41:57,680
and we join, I'm sure,
all the nations of the world

592
00:41:57,720 --> 00:41:59,440
in wishing it well.

593
00:41:59,480 --> 00:42:01,280
Oh!

594
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:02,560
- Hey!
- Let's go!

595
00:42:07,120 --> 00:42:10,240
So welcome, Madam President,
Mr President.

596
00:42:10,280 --> 00:42:12,880
God save you and your mission.

597
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,160
And, as we never tire of saying
hereabouts, God save the Queen.

598
00:42:19,080 --> 00:42:20,240
Cheers.

599
00:42:21,560 --> 00:42:22,960
Cheers.

600
00:42:31,080 --> 00:42:32,840
Oh! Oh!
Sit down and shut up.

601
00:42:46,680 --> 00:42:49,320
Now, do what we say
and no-one gets hurt.

602
00:42:49,360 --> 00:42:50,800
And now,

603
00:42:50,840 --> 00:42:53,040
the good people representing
China in our kitchens tonight

604
00:42:53,080 --> 00:42:55,480
have prepared
something special for us.

605
00:42:55,520 --> 00:42:57,600
And so, without further ado...

606
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:41,120
Ohhh!

607
00:43:53,160 --> 00:43:55,520
Don't try anything!

608
00:44:05,800 --> 00:44:06,520
Monica...

609
00:44:06,560 --> 00:44:07,560
What in the name of...?!

610
00:44:07,600 --> 00:44:08,840
Sit down!

611
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:15,400
Surrender your weapons.

612
00:44:19,800 --> 00:44:22,000
Surrender your weapons,
or both presidents are dead.

613
00:44:38,400 --> 00:44:39,640
Do as she says.

614
00:44:45,000 --> 00:44:47,000
Excellent work.

615
00:46:05,880 --> 00:46:07,640
You're now relieved of duty,
Captain.

616
00:46:31,360 --> 00:46:33,280
This is Captain Young.

617
00:46:33,320 --> 00:46:35,280
May I have your full attention,
please.

618
00:46:37,120 --> 00:46:40,480
I am no longer
captain of this ship.

619
00:46:40,520 --> 00:46:42,640
You are now under the command
of third parties

620
00:46:42,680 --> 00:46:47,280
who are armed and
will brook no insubordination.

621
00:46:47,320 --> 00:46:49,040
It is of paramount importance,

622
00:46:49,080 --> 00:46:52,880
to ensure your safety
and that of our passengers,

623
00:46:52,920 --> 00:46:55,040
you obey
every command you are given.

624
00:46:58,640 --> 00:46:59,760
Vice-President Ridgway.

625
00:46:59,800 --> 00:47:00,760
Admiral.

626
00:47:02,160 --> 00:47:03,240
Chief Hendricks?

627
00:47:05,000 --> 00:47:07,680
'QEII', this is Bravo.
Are you receiving us?

628
00:47:09,240 --> 00:47:10,160
Yes.

629
00:47:10,200 --> 00:47:12,720
Vice-President Ridgway is here.

630
00:47:12,760 --> 00:47:15,520
Mr Ridgway,
as you've no doubt been advised,

631
00:47:15,560 --> 00:47:18,320
I am now in command
of the 'QEII'.

632
00:47:18,360 --> 00:47:20,200
President Wu and President Shaw

633
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:22,120
are now under my command
as well.

634
00:47:23,880 --> 00:47:25,120
No harm has befallen them,

635
00:47:25,160 --> 00:47:27,200
and none will
if the following demand is met.

636
00:47:27,240 --> 00:47:30,320
Miss Chang, the United States
Government does not negotiate...

637
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,520
A permanent resolution

638
00:47:31,560 --> 00:47:34,200
guaranteeing Taiwan's
unconditional independence

639
00:47:34,240 --> 00:47:36,080
and the absolute repudiation
of any claim

640
00:47:36,120 --> 00:47:38,080
the People's Republic of China
may have to her,

641
00:47:38,120 --> 00:47:41,840
must be introduced and approved
by the UN by this time tomorrow,

642
00:47:41,880 --> 00:47:43,960
or the ship and everyone on it
will be destroyed.

643
00:47:45,280 --> 00:47:48,560
Be advised, the bomb that will
sink it is already in place.

644
00:47:48,600 --> 00:47:53,320
And if anyone tries to approach
the 'Queen' by sea or by air,

645
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:54,840
the bomb will be detonated.

646
00:47:56,200 --> 00:47:58,160
We will contact you again
in 24 hours

647
00:47:58,200 --> 00:48:00,320
to see if our demand
has been met.

648
00:48:00,360 --> 00:48:02,240
Chang is a Taiwanese national,

649
00:48:02,280 --> 00:48:04,680
but she left the island with
her family when she was young.

650
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,880
She was settled in Hong Kong.

651
00:48:05,920 --> 00:48:07,400
That's where she got her start
in movies.

652
00:48:07,440 --> 00:48:10,280
Her father was an academic,
publicly outspoken

653
00:48:10,320 --> 00:48:12,800
in his support for Taiwanese
reunification with China.

654
00:48:12,840 --> 00:48:15,440
So the move to Hong Kong -
an exile?

655
00:48:15,480 --> 00:48:18,840
Be my guess. He wasn't
real popular in Taipei.

656
00:48:18,880 --> 00:48:21,360
See, this is where
it gets interesting.

657
00:48:21,400 --> 00:48:22,320
He died young.

658
00:48:22,360 --> 00:48:23,360
Cirrhosis of the liver.

659
00:48:23,400 --> 00:48:24,760
Drank himself to death.

660
00:48:24,800 --> 00:48:26,840
And Monica was an only child.

661
00:48:27,800 --> 00:48:29,200
This is dime store psychology,

662
00:48:29,240 --> 00:48:31,840
but let's say that he never
recovered from being exiled -

663
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,360
that's what the drinking
was about -

664
00:48:33,400 --> 00:48:35,560
and Monica never recovered
from his death.

665
00:48:35,600 --> 00:48:36,720
So this could all be about

666
00:48:36,760 --> 00:48:40,080
restoring the father's good name
in Taiwan -

667
00:48:40,120 --> 00:48:42,640
the daughter's heroism
reflected back on the father.

668
00:48:42,680 --> 00:48:45,000
Like I said,
dime store psychology.

669
00:48:45,040 --> 00:48:46,320
Works for me.

670
00:48:46,360 --> 00:48:47,560
How'd she hook up with Jinks?

671
00:48:47,600 --> 00:48:48,960
A few years ago,

672
00:48:49,000 --> 00:48:51,800
he was the demolitions
consultant on one of her films.

673
00:48:51,840 --> 00:48:54,000
The bomb in the van?
It was a decoy.

674
00:48:54,040 --> 00:48:56,240
They never intended
to explode it on ship.

675
00:48:56,280 --> 00:48:58,160
It was a diversion
to sneak on the real artillery.

676
00:48:58,200 --> 00:48:59,400
Who's this?

677
00:48:59,440 --> 00:49:02,200
That's Kevin Blake.

678
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:04,440
He was one of our sub
commanders, one of the best.

679
00:49:06,040 --> 00:49:08,160
'Was'?
He was discharged with Jinks.

680
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,880
They served together,
they went down together.

681
00:49:10,920 --> 00:49:12,360
For being anti-government?

682
00:49:12,400 --> 00:49:16,320
Virulently so. Their beef was
America's too soft on China.

683
00:49:17,240 --> 00:49:20,800
So Global Zero Alert
must really piss these guys off.

684
00:49:22,440 --> 00:49:24,040
Where's Blake now?

685
00:49:28,040 --> 00:49:30,160
We've entered
the Gipps fracture zone, sir.

686
00:49:30,200 --> 00:49:31,480
At present speed,

687
00:49:31,520 --> 00:49:33,200
we'll reach the Eckert Sea Mount
rendezvous coordinates

688
00:49:33,240 --> 00:49:34,880
well within
the ordered time frame.

689
00:49:35,840 --> 00:49:36,800
Excellent.

690
00:49:50,560 --> 00:49:51,840
Hey, someone's missing.

691
00:49:51,880 --> 00:49:55,280
Miss Cooper is ship security.
She'll know where he is.

692
00:49:55,320 --> 00:49:57,040
Why don't you have her
take you there?

693
00:50:00,560 --> 00:50:02,000
OK, move!

694
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,120
Even if we give Chang
what she wants,

695
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:10,600
she's in the middle
of the damn ocean.

696
00:50:11,960 --> 00:50:14,440
Where is she gonna go?
The 'Lijiang'.

697
00:50:14,480 --> 00:50:15,720
Three days ago,

698
00:50:15,760 --> 00:50:18,120
a Chinese sub disappeared
off our satellite screens.

699
00:50:18,160 --> 00:50:19,920
What if Blake commandeered it?

700
00:50:19,960 --> 00:50:20,960
Alert the 'Polk'.

701
00:50:23,400 --> 00:50:24,360
Mr Vice-President?

702
00:50:24,400 --> 00:50:25,560
Yeah?

703
00:50:25,600 --> 00:50:27,080
I'd like to get on board,
neutralize the bomb.

704
00:50:27,120 --> 00:50:29,600
We have strict instructions
not to approach the ship.

705
00:50:29,640 --> 00:50:30,880
I'll do a HALO jump.

706
00:50:32,480 --> 00:50:34,360
High altitude, low opening?
Right.

707
00:50:34,400 --> 00:50:36,520
Parachute jump from 20,000 feet.

708
00:50:36,560 --> 00:50:38,640
From a plane,
they won't be able to see.

709
00:50:38,680 --> 00:50:40,520
Combat talent, to be exact.

710
00:50:40,560 --> 00:50:42,640
It's outfitted with
special navigational equipment

711
00:50:42,680 --> 00:50:44,800
that can pinpoint the target,
and if I time that jump...

712
00:50:44,840 --> 00:50:46,880
20,000 feet. That's almost...

713
00:50:46,920 --> 00:50:47,880
Four miles.

714
00:50:49,200 --> 00:50:51,680
I was an Air Force
Special Operations commando.

715
00:50:51,720 --> 00:50:52,640
I trained for it.

716
00:50:53,600 --> 00:50:54,640
You'll never make it.

717
00:50:54,680 --> 00:50:56,200
Statistically speaking,
you're right.

718
00:50:57,920 --> 00:51:01,040
But my brother
is on board that ship,

719
00:51:01,080 --> 00:51:02,360
and I WILL make it.

720
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:11,520
This is it.

721
00:51:16,360 --> 00:51:18,240
Vince, this is Brittany.

722
00:51:18,280 --> 00:51:19,640
Listen to me, Vince.

723
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,280
There's a man here in the
corridor with me. He has a gun.

724
00:51:22,320 --> 00:51:23,400
We're coming in.

725
00:51:23,440 --> 00:51:25,120
Place your weapon on the floor
in plain sight

726
00:51:25,160 --> 00:51:26,680
and stand with your hands
above your head.

727
00:51:32,920 --> 00:51:35,080
We're coming in, Vince.
Please cooperate.

728
00:51:48,840 --> 00:51:49,800
Hello?

729
00:51:49,840 --> 00:51:51,600
Hello, Joshua. It's Uncle Vince.

730
00:51:52,560 --> 00:51:54,640
Man, am I glad you woke up!

731
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:10,160
Welcome aboard.

732
00:52:35,240 --> 00:52:36,680
Oh, this is impossible!

733
00:52:39,000 --> 00:52:40,880
Well, if I'm going to search
the whole bloody ship,

734
00:52:40,920 --> 00:52:41,920
I can't do it in these!

735
00:52:46,720 --> 00:52:47,800
Ugh!

736
00:52:58,480 --> 00:53:00,120
Admiral, a call just came in.

737
00:53:00,160 --> 00:53:01,480
Tapped into a relay
from Virginia.

738
00:53:05,360 --> 00:53:06,560
I'm gonna put you on speaker.

739
00:53:07,520 --> 00:53:09,360
OK, everyone can hear you now.
Go ahead.

740
00:53:09,400 --> 00:53:10,760
This is Kelly Kellogg.

741
00:53:10,800 --> 00:53:12,720
My brother-in-law
needs to speak to you.

742
00:53:15,400 --> 00:53:18,040
This is Secret Service Agent
Vincent Kellogg.

743
00:53:18,080 --> 00:53:19,360
I'm on board the 'QEII'.

744
00:53:20,760 --> 00:53:22,840
Kellogg,
this is Vice-President Ridgway.

745
00:53:22,880 --> 00:53:25,120
We know the terrorists
have taken the ship.

746
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:26,960
They've already contacted us.
Where are you?

747
00:53:27,000 --> 00:53:29,840
I'm in an upper deck storage
room, Vice-President Ridgway.

748
00:53:29,880 --> 00:53:31,760
Listen, I know
that there's a team of SEALs

749
00:53:31,800 --> 00:53:33,240
aboard the 'Polk'
right behind us.

750
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:35,600
We've already contacted
the 'Polk'.

751
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:37,520
We need a...

752
00:53:40,120 --> 00:53:41,080
Kellogg?

753
00:54:08,080 --> 00:54:09,960
At 2130 hours tonight,

754
00:54:10,000 --> 00:54:13,120
the 'QEII'
was captured by terrorists.

755
00:54:13,160 --> 00:54:15,720
They now have control
of the ship.

756
00:54:15,760 --> 00:54:17,680
Fortunately, we have
an American agent on board

757
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:19,800
in a position to stop the ship.

758
00:54:19,840 --> 00:54:22,280
As soon as he is able to do so,

759
00:54:22,320 --> 00:54:25,480
we will board the 'Queen'
and recapture her.

760
00:54:26,480 --> 00:54:27,720
Joshua, Kelly, hello!

761
00:54:27,760 --> 00:54:30,320
Can you read me?
Are you there? Hello?

762
00:54:30,360 --> 00:54:33,080
Is there another radio on board,
one that isn't blacked out?

763
00:54:33,120 --> 00:54:34,520
Only on the bridge,

764
00:54:34,560 --> 00:54:37,240
but the atmospheric interference
will be affecting that too.

765
00:54:39,640 --> 00:54:41,320
Here's how we stop the ship.

766
00:54:43,440 --> 00:54:46,040
In the engine room, here,

767
00:54:46,080 --> 00:54:48,080
there's
a dual-pitch control unit.

768
00:54:48,120 --> 00:54:50,280
It's designed
for just this purpose -

769
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:51,800
to override the engine
and halt the ship

770
00:54:51,840 --> 00:54:53,120
in case of an emergency.

771
00:54:53,160 --> 00:54:54,440
Can you operate it?

772
00:54:54,480 --> 00:54:56,680
Yes. It's all manual.

773
00:54:56,720 --> 00:55:00,200
Several control levers,
adjustment wheels.

774
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:01,880
We just have to get to it.

775
00:55:02,840 --> 00:55:05,920
You mean a ship this big -
we can stop it by anchor?

776
00:55:05,960 --> 00:55:08,080
An unadvertised special.

777
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:33,680
Lock down the area!

778
00:55:35,240 --> 00:55:36,560
Mrs Kellogg,
I'm Vice-President Ridgway.

779
00:55:37,480 --> 00:55:40,480
Hi...I mean, welcome,
Mr Vice-President.

780
00:55:40,520 --> 00:55:42,000
I didn't expect...

781
00:55:42,040 --> 00:55:43,960
When they said they were sending
somebody over, I didn't think...

782
00:55:44,000 --> 00:55:45,440
My call.

783
00:55:45,480 --> 00:55:48,040
The brass seemed much more at
home in the Pentagon than I did.

784
00:55:49,000 --> 00:55:50,880
Has your brother-in-law
recontacted you?

785
00:55:50,920 --> 00:55:52,360
Not yet.

786
00:55:52,400 --> 00:55:54,040
The house is secure,
Mr Vice-President.

787
00:55:54,080 --> 00:55:55,440
Where's the radio?

788
00:55:55,480 --> 00:55:57,720
It's upstairs, in Joshua's room.

789
00:56:05,040 --> 00:56:06,080
Hart.

790
00:56:08,160 --> 00:56:09,240
Hart!

791
00:56:12,920 --> 00:56:16,120
Saunders?
Yeah?

792
00:56:16,160 --> 00:56:18,760
Is Hart with you?
Negative.

793
00:56:19,880 --> 00:56:21,160
Deng...

794
00:56:27,120 --> 00:56:30,000
Hello? Joshua?
Kelly? Hello? Hello?

795
00:56:30,040 --> 00:56:33,360
Special Agent Kellogg,
this is Vice-President Ridgway.

796
00:56:33,400 --> 00:56:35,400
The Secretary of Defense
and the joint chiefs

797
00:56:35,440 --> 00:56:37,000
are all with us too.

798
00:56:37,040 --> 00:56:38,440
Yes, sir.

799
00:56:38,480 --> 00:56:40,880
Brittany Cooper, Head of Ship
Security, managed to escape.

800
00:56:40,920 --> 00:56:42,760
She's with me right now.

801
00:56:42,800 --> 00:56:45,680
We, um, we have a plan
for stopping the ship, sir.

802
00:56:45,720 --> 00:56:46,800
Excellent.

803
00:56:46,840 --> 00:56:48,400
We must reach the engine room
to do it,

804
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,400
so we'll be incommunicado
from here on out.

805
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:51,720
I understand.

806
00:56:51,760 --> 00:56:53,560
Tell the 'Polk' when they see
the ship slow down,

807
00:56:53,600 --> 00:56:54,960
that's when they should
make their move -

808
00:56:55,000 --> 00:56:56,200
deploy the SEALs,

809
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,160
have them meet us port-side,
upper deck railing.

810
00:56:59,200 --> 00:57:00,280
Oh, wait!

811
00:57:01,440 --> 00:57:03,280
Mr Vice-President...

812
00:57:04,920 --> 00:57:06,840
..the custodian
of China's nuclear codes

813
00:57:06,880 --> 00:57:09,400
was murdered by the terrorists.

814
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:10,880
They've confiscated
his briefcase.

815
00:57:10,920 --> 00:57:13,080
If they uplink
those codes,

816
00:57:13,120 --> 00:57:15,440
they'll control
China's nuclear arsenal.

817
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:18,600
This isn't about a UN
resolution, they're buying time.

818
00:57:18,640 --> 00:57:20,280
Can those codes be overridden?

819
00:57:20,320 --> 00:57:22,080
Only by President Wu.

820
00:57:22,120 --> 00:57:23,640
One last thing -

821
00:57:23,680 --> 00:57:26,760
someone's on his way
to deal with that bomb on board.

822
00:57:30,720 --> 00:57:31,920
On his way how, sir?

823
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:34,200
He's gonna make a parachute jump
onto the ship.

824
00:57:34,240 --> 00:57:37,920
A HALO jump.
That's impossible.

825
00:57:41,080 --> 00:57:42,360
Who is it, sir?

826
00:57:42,400 --> 00:57:45,600
ATF agent named Kellogg.

827
00:57:45,640 --> 00:57:48,680
He should be with you
by 0200 hours.

828
00:57:48,720 --> 00:57:51,520
If he makes it. Good luck.

829
00:57:51,560 --> 00:57:55,240
God bless.
A HALO jump?! Is he mad?

830
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:58,400
No, he's just addicted to risk.

831
00:58:00,240 --> 00:58:01,680
Dammit.

832
00:58:01,720 --> 00:58:03,480
I swear that kid's got
a death wish.

833
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,200
Why does he have to be
so stubborn?

834
00:58:06,240 --> 00:58:08,200
Why can't he just admit
when he's in over his head?

835
00:58:08,240 --> 00:58:10,160
As opposed to
the sensible brother

836
00:58:10,200 --> 00:58:11,840
who's about to try and stop
an ocean liner

837
00:58:11,880 --> 00:58:13,040
full of terrorists?

838
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:15,840
He just pulls these stunts
to piss me off.

839
00:58:15,880 --> 00:58:17,280
I swear to God he does.

840
00:58:35,480 --> 00:58:37,120
I thought you might need
some coffee.

841
00:58:37,160 --> 00:58:38,840
Very thoughtful of you.

842
00:58:40,280 --> 00:58:42,400
Any word?
Not yet.

843
00:58:43,800 --> 00:58:45,600
Why don't you stay?
We'll find out together.

844
00:59:17,880 --> 00:59:18,920
Thanks. Don't smoke.

845
00:59:18,960 --> 00:59:21,480
Neither do I.
Just keep 'em around.

846
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,360
For the occasional dead man
jumping?

847
00:59:24,400 --> 00:59:25,320
Something like that.

848
00:59:25,360 --> 00:59:26,640
I'll be honest with you -

849
00:59:26,680 --> 00:59:31,240
I wouldn't do what you're doing,
except under orders.

850
00:59:31,280 --> 00:59:32,320
Good.

851
00:59:32,360 --> 00:59:33,600
Last thing we need
in the service

852
00:59:33,640 --> 00:59:36,160
is a bunch of crazy people
running round.

853
00:59:36,200 --> 00:59:40,040
So that agent, the one
who set up the radio - Kellogg.

854
00:59:40,080 --> 00:59:41,040
Any relation?

855
00:59:43,440 --> 00:59:44,520
He's my brother.

856
00:59:44,560 --> 00:59:46,920
Wow!
What are the chances of that?

857
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,800
You put your life on the line
to save him.

858
00:59:49,840 --> 00:59:52,160
I don't know if I could do that
for my brother.

859
00:59:53,480 --> 00:59:54,440
Sure you would.

860
00:59:55,280 --> 00:59:57,600
That explains it, then.

861
00:59:57,640 --> 00:59:59,080
Explains what?

862
00:59:59,120 --> 01:00:02,000
Why an ATF agent's making the
jump instead of one of our guys.

863
01:00:02,040 --> 01:00:03,080
What's his name?

864
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,640
What?

865
01:00:04,680 --> 01:00:05,800
Your brother.

866
01:00:05,840 --> 01:00:07,840
What's his name?

867
01:00:07,880 --> 01:00:08,960
Jack.

868
01:00:23,560 --> 01:00:24,520
Go.

869
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,960
Roger.

870
01:00:29,000 --> 01:00:30,080
One minute and counting down.

871
01:00:32,080 --> 01:00:33,040
Let's do it.

872
01:00:46,120 --> 01:00:47,080
30 seconds.

873
01:01:04,320 --> 01:01:06,120
15 seconds!

874
01:01:12,520 --> 01:01:13,760
GO!

875
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:31,720
Bravo, can you read me?

876
01:02:31,760 --> 01:02:32,680
We read you.

877
01:02:32,720 --> 01:02:33,720
It's Kellogg.

878
01:02:33,760 --> 01:02:34,760
Vince?

879
01:02:34,800 --> 01:02:37,320
No. Thomas.

880
01:02:38,840 --> 01:02:42,000
I made it. I'm on the 'Queen'.

881
01:02:50,880 --> 01:02:52,280
Anything?

882
01:02:52,320 --> 01:02:53,560
No, sir. Nothing.

883
01:02:54,880 --> 01:02:58,240
Stay sharp, guys.
The 'Lijiang's out there.

884
01:02:58,280 --> 01:03:00,160
It's only a matter of time.

885
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,520
Surface contact, Captain.

886
01:03:14,560 --> 01:03:18,360
Bearing, 085.
Range, 11,000 metres.

887
01:03:18,400 --> 01:03:21,880
Narrow band indicates
it's the 'QEII', sir.

888
01:03:21,920 --> 01:03:24,280
Won't be long now, gentlemen.

889
01:04:06,640 --> 01:04:07,920
Go and see who that is.

890
01:04:13,720 --> 01:04:14,680
Deng!

891
01:04:17,560 --> 01:04:19,040
Deng Bao, are you alright?

892
01:04:19,080 --> 01:04:20,040
DOWN!

893
01:04:29,520 --> 01:04:31,040
Thomas!

894
01:04:34,720 --> 01:04:36,000
You're crazy, you know that?

895
01:04:37,680 --> 01:04:40,800
If there's a bomb on board,
it's gonna be near the fuel.

896
01:04:40,840 --> 01:04:43,320
The fuel tanks
are near the engine room.

897
01:04:52,680 --> 01:04:56,080
The pitch levers are over there.
The fuel tank's down there.

898
01:05:38,040 --> 01:05:40,040
I've taken bridge control
and given it to us.

899
01:05:40,080 --> 01:05:42,000
You take
the port-side propeller shaft.

900
01:05:42,040 --> 01:05:45,160
We turn the wheel together
until the dial reaches zero.

901
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,600
That'll stop the ship.

902
01:05:46,640 --> 01:05:47,720
Got it.

903
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,720
Here we go.

904
01:06:18,680 --> 01:06:20,200
In case things...

905
01:06:22,120 --> 01:06:23,200
I just wanted you to know

906
01:06:23,240 --> 01:06:25,040
how much I've enjoyed
these past few days.

907
01:06:25,080 --> 01:06:26,680
As have I.

908
01:06:26,720 --> 01:06:29,080
I've always wanted to visit
Beijing.

909
01:06:29,120 --> 01:06:32,960
I hear your Great Hall puts
our Capitol Building to shame.

910
01:06:33,000 --> 01:06:35,640
Come see for yourself,
as my guest.

911
01:06:35,680 --> 01:06:38,440
This is how the world works,
isn't it?

912
01:06:38,480 --> 01:06:39,480
The powerful
whispering secretly,

913
01:06:39,520 --> 01:06:42,160
deciding the fate
of everyone else.

914
01:06:42,200 --> 01:06:44,200
You don't know
what you're talking about.

915
01:06:44,240 --> 01:06:45,160
Ah!

916
01:06:45,200 --> 01:06:46,880
Stop it!

917
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:47,920
Excuse me.

918
01:06:49,640 --> 01:06:51,520
Would you like to die
in her place?

919
01:06:51,560 --> 01:06:53,680
I will if I have to.

920
01:06:53,720 --> 01:06:54,680
Mmm.

921
01:06:57,000 --> 01:06:58,760
You're a brave man,
Special Agent.

922
01:06:59,800 --> 01:07:01,440
That man's willing
to sacrifice his life for you.

923
01:07:01,480 --> 01:07:03,200
And you, Madam President?

924
01:07:05,320 --> 01:07:06,560
Would you do the same for him?

925
01:07:13,000 --> 01:07:14,000
Mmm.

926
01:07:17,040 --> 01:07:18,920
Mmm.

927
01:07:22,120 --> 01:07:23,840
Let that be your dying thought.

928
01:07:48,280 --> 01:07:49,240
Ping!

929
01:08:01,520 --> 01:08:04,800
Sierra 11 appears to be
losing forward speed, sir.

930
01:08:04,840 --> 01:08:08,280
New rev count indicates
23 knots and rapidly falling.

931
01:08:08,320 --> 01:08:10,680
Put the SEALs on ready alert.
Sir!

932
01:08:20,320 --> 01:08:22,960
It's stopping too soon,
before we reach rendezvous.

933
01:08:23,000 --> 01:08:24,320
Underwater contact, sir.

934
01:08:24,360 --> 01:08:26,400
Bearing 133,
just off the 'Queen's stern.

935
01:08:26,440 --> 01:08:28,400
American?
I can't tell.

936
01:08:30,520 --> 01:08:32,880
They're preparing
to rescue the presidents.

937
01:08:32,920 --> 01:08:35,040
We have a submerged contact,

938
01:08:35,080 --> 01:08:38,360
bearing 340, range 2,000 yards.

939
01:08:38,400 --> 01:08:42,680
Designate Sierra 17.
Possible hostile submarine.

940
01:08:42,720 --> 01:08:45,800
It's Blake. It's gotta be Blake
in the 'Lijiang'.

941
01:08:46,760 --> 01:08:47,920
Red alert!

942
01:08:47,960 --> 01:08:50,040
Man
battle stations, torpedo!

943
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,560
Rig for ultra-quiet.

944
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:00,360
Take us under the 'Queen'.
Sir.

945
01:09:02,760 --> 01:09:03,720
We've done it!

946
01:09:15,200 --> 01:09:16,160
Why have we stopped?

947
01:09:19,520 --> 01:09:21,280
Why did you stop the ship?

948
01:09:22,240 --> 01:09:23,800
I...I...didn't.

949
01:09:26,040 --> 01:09:28,040
Then why have we stopped?

950
01:09:29,200 --> 01:09:30,960
Perhaps someone
applied the pitch levers.

951
01:09:31,000 --> 01:09:34,480
Are you telling me someone else
is controlling this ship?

952
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:08,880
Yellow team,
work on a security link.

953
01:10:08,920 --> 01:10:11,920
I want you to stay tight
with Sierra 11.

954
01:10:15,200 --> 01:10:16,960
All battle
stations are manned.

955
01:10:17,000 --> 01:10:20,880
Time to intercept track -
4 minutes and 10 seconds.

956
01:10:20,920 --> 01:10:23,680
Sierra 17 is descending
and headed on course

957
01:10:23,720 --> 01:10:26,240
for a direct intercept
with the 'Queen'.

958
01:10:26,280 --> 01:10:29,000
He's going under her,
where he'll be safe from us.

959
01:10:29,040 --> 01:10:30,720
Smart, Blake.

960
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:40,120
I've lost them, sir.

961
01:10:40,160 --> 01:10:42,840
They're most likely drifting
silently beneath the 'Queen'.

962
01:10:42,880 --> 01:10:45,960
Then how can we risk surfacing
to release the SEALs, sir?

963
01:10:46,000 --> 01:10:46,960
We're not gonna surface.

964
01:10:48,520 --> 01:10:51,440
I intend to approach the 'QEII'
then, while still submerged,

965
01:10:51,480 --> 01:10:52,640
release our team

966
01:10:52,680 --> 01:10:54,600
through the aft access
trunks pressure chamber.

967
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:07,480
No! Stop!

968
01:11:07,520 --> 01:11:08,800
Get out of here now!

969
01:11:08,840 --> 01:11:10,200
Go!

970
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,080
I haven't figured out
how this is activated yet.

971
01:11:19,120 --> 01:11:20,080
It could go any second.

972
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:21,320
Then leave it!

973
01:11:21,360 --> 01:11:22,760
One bomb's not enough
to take down this ship,

974
01:11:22,800 --> 01:11:24,040
but it sure as hell's
gonna take YOU down.

975
01:11:24,080 --> 01:11:25,040
Let's go, Thomas!

976
01:11:26,440 --> 01:11:28,680
- 95.
- 95.

977
01:11:28,720 --> 01:11:31,160
- 90 feet.
- 90 feet.

978
01:11:31,200 --> 01:11:33,480
- 89.
- 89.

979
01:11:33,520 --> 01:11:35,360
- 88.
- 88.

980
01:11:35,400 --> 01:11:38,520
Nudge her up nice and quietly,
gentlemen.

981
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,240
Is Commander Layton ready?

982
01:11:40,280 --> 01:11:42,880
They're all jacked up
and ready for a fight, sir.

983
01:11:42,920 --> 01:11:45,240
We're ready at 85 feet
and counting, Commander.

984
01:11:45,280 --> 01:11:46,520
You have my permission

985
01:11:46,560 --> 01:11:48,480
to enter the trunk
and access the pressure chamber.

986
01:11:48,520 --> 01:11:50,360
Thanks for the hospitality,
Captain.

987
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:53,360
Request permission to open the
access hatch and enter chamber.

988
01:11:53,400 --> 01:11:54,520
Permission granted, Commander.

989
01:11:54,560 --> 01:11:57,360
Mount 'em up, ladies.
It's time to rumble.

990
01:12:00,240 --> 01:12:02,000
This is suicide, Thomas!
Come on!

991
01:12:02,040 --> 01:12:04,120
I'm not abandoning a live bomb.

992
01:12:05,080 --> 01:12:06,520
Thomas, the terrorists
are probably

993
01:12:06,560 --> 01:12:07,960
on their way down here
right now!

994
01:12:08,000 --> 01:12:10,840
Then stop wasting time
talking to me. Go!

995
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:13,000
He's right, Vince. Let's go.

996
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,560
No.

997
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:18,560
You've been trying to kill
yourself for years, haven't you?

998
01:12:19,840 --> 01:12:21,040
Ever since Jack died,

999
01:12:21,080 --> 01:12:23,320
like that's gonna even the score
somehow.

1000
01:12:23,360 --> 01:12:25,560
You have no idea
what you're talking about.

1001
01:12:25,600 --> 01:12:28,640
It was an accident, Thomas.
It wasn't your fault.

1002
01:12:28,680 --> 01:12:30,480
How do you know, Vince?
You weren't there!

1003
01:12:30,520 --> 01:12:32,760
Because I knew Jack
and I know you!

1004
01:12:32,800 --> 01:12:34,760
You're always trying
to take control of everything,

1005
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,000
like you're God or something,
and you're not!

1006
01:12:37,040 --> 01:12:38,840
That is such a crock.

1007
01:12:38,880 --> 01:12:41,560
Some things are
out of your control, Thomas.

1008
01:12:41,600 --> 01:12:43,520
Jack dying is one of them.

1009
01:12:45,400 --> 01:12:47,440
It's your job
to go and rescue the presidents.

1010
01:12:49,720 --> 01:12:50,680
Do it.

1011
01:12:52,280 --> 01:12:53,760
You let me do mine.

1012
01:12:55,880 --> 01:12:56,840
Let's go.

1013
01:13:00,440 --> 01:13:02,480
I'll see you topside
when you're done.

1014
01:13:18,600 --> 01:13:21,760
Sir, I'm reading high levels
of carbon dioxide

1015
01:13:21,800 --> 01:13:22,920
in the upper trunk.

1016
01:13:22,960 --> 01:13:24,840
Recommend that
we take a couple of minutes

1017
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:26,120
and vent the area
before continuing.

1018
01:13:26,160 --> 01:13:27,280
No. We have no time.

1019
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:29,000
Let the first one drop,
then we'll ventilate.

1020
01:13:33,280 --> 01:13:36,520
I have a green light on
the access trunk hatch display.

1021
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:37,840
Ready the chamber.

1022
01:13:37,880 --> 01:13:39,840
Seal the access trunk hatch.

1023
01:13:39,880 --> 01:13:40,960
Prepare to equalize.

1024
01:13:42,120 --> 01:13:43,920
Access trunk is now sealed.

1025
01:13:43,960 --> 01:13:46,200
Open the seawater valves.
Let's get 'em wet.

1026
01:13:46,240 --> 01:13:47,840
Opening valves
1, 2 and 3...

1027
01:13:47,880 --> 01:13:51,040
We've got 3 feet of draft
in the chamber and rising.

1028
01:13:51,080 --> 01:13:52,240
Increasing
air pressure

1029
01:13:52,280 --> 01:13:54,360
in preparation
for full access hatch release.

1030
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:04,080
Where are these
dual pitch levers?

1031
01:14:07,960 --> 01:14:09,280
All SEALs are away.

1032
01:14:10,360 --> 01:14:12,920
Dive the boat.
Make your new depth 500 feet.

1033
01:14:12,960 --> 01:14:14,560
Dive the boat. Aye, sir.

1034
01:14:15,640 --> 01:14:16,520
Dive!

1035
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:18,280
Dive! Dive!

1036
01:14:18,320 --> 01:14:21,560
All ahead full
on new course of 180.

1037
01:14:21,600 --> 01:14:23,400
OK, gentlemen. Let's go hunting.

1038
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:51,920
The presidents are down below.

1039
01:14:51,960 --> 01:14:54,080
The rest of the crew
is this way.

1040
01:14:54,120 --> 01:14:55,960
Move out.
Come on!

1041
01:15:09,560 --> 01:15:11,000
Stop right there!

1042
01:15:20,280 --> 01:15:21,920
Drop your weapon!

1043
01:15:21,960 --> 01:15:23,280
I'll kill him! You know I will.

1044
01:15:37,760 --> 01:15:39,400
You OK?
You take care of the crew.

1045
01:15:39,440 --> 01:15:41,520
I'll go after her.
Come on.

1046
01:15:41,560 --> 01:15:42,520
Let's move it!

1047
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:50,880
Contact is diving and
heading on a new course of 180.

1048
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,160
I need an immediate firing
solution, tubes 1 and 2.

1049
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:10,920
ARGGH!

1050
01:17:52,120 --> 01:17:53,960
There is a bomb on board.

1051
01:18:23,520 --> 01:18:24,840
Come on, people! Move!

1052
01:18:30,080 --> 01:18:31,360
Go, go, go, go, go!

1053
01:18:32,800 --> 01:18:33,760
Ugh!

1054
01:18:35,880 --> 01:18:36,840
Arggh!

1055
01:18:51,800 --> 01:18:53,760
President Shaw, President Wu,
all of you,

1056
01:18:53,800 --> 01:18:55,000
follow us please, now!

1057
01:19:01,120 --> 01:19:02,080
Wrong again.

1058
01:19:03,360 --> 01:19:05,920
What the hell is holding up
my firing solution?!

1059
01:19:05,960 --> 01:19:07,640
I'm just
getting it now, sir.

1060
01:19:08,640 --> 01:19:10,440
Torpedoes ready for firing.

1061
01:19:10,480 --> 01:19:12,960
Open and flood tubes 1 and 2.

1062
01:19:13,000 --> 01:19:15,040
Tubes 1 and 2 open and flooded.

1063
01:19:15,080 --> 01:19:16,040
Fire 1.

1064
01:19:17,720 --> 01:19:18,680
Fire 2.

1065
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:25,080
Torpedoes in the water.
Bearing, 048 and 050.

1066
01:19:27,560 --> 01:19:28,520
Right full rudder.

1067
01:19:28,560 --> 01:19:30,480
All ahead flank.

1068
01:19:33,840 --> 01:19:35,560
Lodge port countermeasures.

1069
01:19:39,960 --> 01:19:42,000
Countermeasures
away.

1070
01:19:42,040 --> 01:19:42,920
Rig for collision.

1071
01:19:55,560 --> 01:19:59,120
Torpedoes are at 2,500 yards
and closing, sir.

1072
01:19:59,160 --> 01:20:01,600
XO, I want that flank speed
and I want it now!

1073
01:20:01,640 --> 01:20:04,120
Maneuvering is answering
the flank bell, Captain.

1074
01:20:04,160 --> 01:20:05,120
23 knots.

1075
01:20:08,320 --> 01:20:09,480
24.

1076
01:20:11,800 --> 01:20:12,800
25.

1077
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,520
Torpedoes are range gaining.

1078
01:20:14,560 --> 01:20:18,120
Range is down to 1,660 yards
and continuing to close.

1079
01:20:18,160 --> 01:20:19,520
26 knots.

1080
01:20:21,040 --> 01:20:23,160
Torpedoes are 1,000 yards
and closing.

1081
01:20:23,200 --> 01:20:24,440
27.

1082
01:20:24,480 --> 01:20:27,160
Sound collision alarm.
Shift rudder hard to port.

1083
01:20:29,560 --> 01:20:32,000
Hold on, guys.
It's gonna be close.

1084
01:20:32,040 --> 01:20:33,960
Range is 400 yards and closing.

1085
01:20:38,800 --> 01:20:40,840
Torpedoes appear to be turning,
sir.

1086
01:20:40,880 --> 01:20:42,800
They're going after the decoys.

1087
01:20:51,520 --> 01:20:53,120
Get me a firm lock
on that shooter.

1088
01:20:53,160 --> 01:20:54,120
Aye, aye, sir.

1089
01:20:56,640 --> 01:20:58,360
All stops grabbing the reactor.

1090
01:20:58,400 --> 01:21:00,440
Prepare to snapshot
tubes 1 and 2.

1091
01:21:01,680 --> 01:21:02,560
Come on!

1092
01:21:02,600 --> 01:21:04,360
Time for Plan B.

1093
01:21:18,160 --> 01:21:19,400
Fire 1.

1094
01:21:20,720 --> 01:21:21,680
Fire 2.

1095
01:21:28,920 --> 01:21:30,400
Where's Monica?

1096
01:21:30,440 --> 01:21:31,520
She's dead.

1097
01:21:40,000 --> 01:21:40,960
Sir?

1098
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:49,840
Sonofabitch.

1099
01:21:54,560 --> 01:21:57,040
Everybody get down!

1100
01:21:59,840 --> 01:22:01,000
It's Thomas.

1101
01:22:02,200 --> 01:22:04,120
The bomb.

1102
01:22:06,920 --> 01:22:08,880
What was that?

1103
01:22:08,920 --> 01:22:11,560
A bomb in the fuel room.
We must get you off this ship.

1104
01:22:11,600 --> 01:22:12,800
Go. Go!
Let's go! Move!

1105
01:22:14,320 --> 01:22:16,720
Move! Let's go,
let's go, let's go! Come on!

1106
01:22:16,760 --> 01:22:17,720
Vince.

1107
01:22:21,800 --> 01:22:22,760
Thomas!

1108
01:22:30,720 --> 01:22:31,680
Thomas...

1109
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:34,440
Hey.

1110
01:22:42,120 --> 01:22:45,800
This is President Shaw. I have
a message for Joshua Kellogg.

1111
01:22:45,840 --> 01:22:47,520
He's right here.

1112
01:22:47,560 --> 01:22:49,960
Joshua, your Uncle Vince
will be home this weekend.

1113
01:22:50,000 --> 01:22:52,280
He's looking forward
to seeing you at the game.

1114
01:22:53,320 --> 01:22:54,360
Are you OK, Eleanor?

1115
01:22:54,400 --> 01:22:56,440
We're safe, Chet -

1116
01:22:56,480 --> 01:22:59,240
President Wu, the 'Queen',

1117
01:22:59,280 --> 01:23:01,400
and everyone on it.

1118
01:23:09,720 --> 01:23:11,000
Hey.
Hey.

1119
01:23:12,880 --> 01:23:14,960
You remember when we were kids,

1120
01:23:15,000 --> 01:23:17,320
how Jack always said someday
he was gonna get on a ship,

1121
01:23:17,360 --> 01:23:18,320
sail around the world?

1122
01:23:19,280 --> 01:23:20,240
Yeah, I remember.

1123
01:23:21,360 --> 01:23:22,640
I think he would've liked
this ship.

1124
01:23:23,880 --> 01:23:25,600
Yeah, I think he would have.

1125
01:23:29,200 --> 01:23:31,920
Did you mean what you said
down there about Jack?

1126
01:23:31,960 --> 01:23:34,240
You don't blame me
for what happened?

1127
01:23:35,320 --> 01:23:36,560
No, I don't blame you.

1128
01:23:36,600 --> 01:23:37,720
I never blamed you.

1129
01:23:39,400 --> 01:23:40,800
Jack was climbing
where he shouldn't have.

1130
01:23:40,840 --> 01:23:42,040
The rope slipped.

1131
01:23:42,080 --> 01:23:43,400
There's nothing
you could've done about that.

1132
01:23:44,880 --> 01:23:46,480
How come I blame me?

1133
01:23:48,120 --> 01:23:50,160
Well, maybe 'cause you never
talk about it with anybody.

1134
01:23:50,200 --> 01:23:52,360
You just keep it all inside,
you know.

1135
01:23:53,800 --> 01:23:54,960
I'm a Kellogg.

1136
01:23:55,000 --> 01:23:57,720
OK, fair enough.

1137
01:24:00,520 --> 01:24:02,400
But just so that we're clear
on this,

1138
01:24:02,440 --> 01:24:04,120
the reason
why I get so mad at you

1139
01:24:04,160 --> 01:24:05,520
when you put your life in danger

1140
01:24:05,560 --> 01:24:06,840
is 'cause I already lost
one brother

1141
01:24:07,920 --> 01:24:10,040
and I don't want to lose
another one.

1142
01:24:19,400 --> 01:24:20,800
Look what I found.

1143
01:24:22,840 --> 01:24:25,320
Man, I haven't
seen that in years.

1144
01:24:25,360 --> 01:24:27,520
They're hard to get, you know?
Uh-huh.

1145
01:24:27,560 --> 01:24:28,560
You gotta go the distance.

1146
01:24:28,600 --> 01:24:29,600
Yeah.
Mmm.

1147
01:24:31,200 --> 01:24:32,920
I bet you Joshua
would like this, huh?

1148
01:24:32,960 --> 01:24:34,320
Yeah.

1149
01:24:35,520 --> 01:24:37,400
Gentlemen,
the captain has requested

1150
01:24:37,440 --> 01:24:39,440
the honor of your presence
at his breakfast table.

1151
01:24:39,480 --> 01:24:40,440
Hmm.

1152
01:24:45,520 --> 01:24:46,920
Oh, breakfast.

1153
01:24:46,960 --> 01:24:49,640
I'm still a little, you know...

1154
01:24:51,480 --> 01:24:52,400
Catch you guys later.

1155
01:24:52,440 --> 01:24:54,480
'Bye.
Sure.

1156
01:25:00,960 --> 01:25:01,920
Mmm.

1157
01:25:04,200 --> 01:25:06,800
I could be wrong,
but I think we're gonna get

1158
01:25:06,840 --> 01:25:09,960
a lot more than just lunch
at the White House out of this.

1159
01:25:10,000 --> 01:25:11,840
A weekend
in the Lincoln bedroom, perhaps.

1160
01:25:11,880 --> 01:25:15,360
What, and ruin the memory of a
perfectly good one-night stand?
