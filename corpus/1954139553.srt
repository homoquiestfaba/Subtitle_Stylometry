1
00:01:05,498 --> 00:01:07,966
Come on mama, you're too slow.

2
00:01:07,968 --> 00:01:11,637
You're too young,
give me a moment.

3
00:01:12,806 --> 00:01:15,441
My little girl,
so pretty and so big.

4
00:01:15,443 --> 00:01:20,012
Let's go home and I will make you
something delicious. You'll see.

5
00:01:44,771 --> 00:01:47,706
What's happening?
I don't know.

6
00:02:27,747 --> 00:02:31,416
Isabella! Are you ok?
Yes! Yes, but we are very scared.

7
00:02:31,418 --> 00:02:32,584
Get in!

8
00:02:50,837 --> 00:02:51,670
Go left!

9
00:02:53,773 --> 00:02:54,806
Go faster!

10
00:02:59,412 --> 00:03:00,946
We need to go faster!

11
00:03:11,925 --> 00:03:13,992
Mommy, Mommy, Mommy!

12
00:04:03,576 --> 00:04:06,612
Come on guys keep up.

13
00:04:06,614 --> 00:04:08,914
Nobody mentioned about
3 flights of stairs.

14
00:04:08,916 --> 00:04:11,250
Oh it adds to it's charm honey.

15
00:04:11,252 --> 00:04:15,120
Is this what you call packing light?
Sorry, I forgot what to leave behind.

16
00:04:15,122 --> 00:04:17,623
I mean a whole week in Italy.
Can you imagine.

17
00:04:17,625 --> 00:04:20,158
What did you pack in here?
Books mostly.

18
00:04:20,160 --> 00:04:22,361
You couldn't leave
some of them behind?

19
00:04:22,363 --> 00:04:23,862
Now way! We're gonna
be seeing Pompeii dad.

20
00:04:23,864 --> 00:04:25,697
There's so much to study up on.

21
00:04:25,699 --> 00:04:28,433
The geological composition of the
area, the history of devastation--

22
00:04:28,435 --> 00:04:30,335
Ok! I got it.

23
00:04:30,337 --> 00:04:34,839
Couldn't you just given her a kindle?
You ever thought about raising my allowance?

24
00:04:35,342 --> 00:04:37,510
She's your daughter.

25
00:04:38,512 --> 00:04:41,179
You are too smart for
your own good young lady.

26
00:04:41,181 --> 00:04:44,650
Awesome! There's a loft.

27
00:04:44,652 --> 00:04:47,052
Oh awesome. More charm.

28
00:04:47,054 --> 00:04:49,821
Yeah. More stairs.

29
00:04:49,823 --> 00:04:51,890
Wait a minute.
How many bedrooms is this?

30
00:04:51,892 --> 00:04:54,993
Oh...
Oh no..

31
00:04:54,995 --> 00:04:57,596
It's gonna be fun.
Yeah.

32
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:08,907
I am so excited how
everything's turning out.

33
00:05:08,909 --> 00:05:12,311
Dad, say hi.
Hi. Hi.

34
00:05:12,313 --> 00:05:14,079
Mom.

35
00:05:16,650 --> 00:05:21,053
Mykaela and I are getting to tag
along on your business trip.

36
00:05:21,055 --> 00:05:23,422
And get a week's
vacation in Italy.

37
00:05:23,424 --> 00:05:26,425
Seeing all the places
she's dreamed about.

38
00:05:26,559 --> 00:05:29,394
You're about to get your dream job.
Oh yeah.

39
00:05:30,163 --> 00:05:34,066
Yeah I know.
It's working out perfectly.

40
00:05:34,667 --> 00:05:35,701
Yeah.

41
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:39,838
Hey. What is it?
Nothing. I'm just a little jet lagged.

42
00:05:43,142 --> 00:05:45,043
I can read you like a book.

43
00:05:45,045 --> 00:05:46,378
Spill it.

44
00:05:46,380 --> 00:05:49,581
Well this job. It's a big
deal for me... for us.

45
00:05:49,583 --> 00:05:52,584
Yeah. It's a great opportunity.

46
00:05:52,586 --> 00:05:56,588
You're about to run your own
international security company.

47
00:05:56,590 --> 00:06:00,092
And you're going to be great.

48
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:01,960
Ok listen.

49
00:06:04,297 --> 00:06:08,600
You'll be here for 3 months.
Then you get to come home.

50
00:06:09,202 --> 00:06:11,937
And will never have to
worry about money again.

51
00:06:13,039 --> 00:06:15,941
I'm just worried about this presentation.
It needs more work.

52
00:06:15,943 --> 00:06:18,143
Stop.
Just--

53
00:06:18,145 --> 00:06:20,178
No. You've been working
on it for weeks.

54
00:06:20,313 --> 00:06:23,482
This is what you do.
This is who you are.

55
00:06:23,484 --> 00:06:25,450
It's good. It's really good.

56
00:06:25,452 --> 00:06:27,252
Yeah?
Yeah.

57
00:06:27,254 --> 00:06:28,820
They're gonna love you.

58
00:06:32,125 --> 00:06:35,394
What would I do without you, huh?
Nothing.

59
00:06:37,398 --> 00:06:40,399
Hey kiddo, you're ready?
Yeah.

60
00:06:40,933 --> 00:06:42,200
You bet.

61
00:06:50,843 --> 00:06:52,244
<i>Benvenuto e ben benvenuta.</i>

62
00:06:52,246 --> 00:06:55,180
Ladies and Gentlemen
please form one line.

63
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:57,816
Sorry I can't go with you guys.

64
00:06:57,818 --> 00:07:01,186
Well we wish you could go too but,
somebody's gotta bring home the bacon.

65
00:07:01,188 --> 00:07:02,454
Come on mom.

66
00:07:02,456 --> 00:07:04,456
Hey hold on. Pompeii
is not going anywhere.

67
00:07:04,458 --> 00:07:06,124
We'll see you tonight?
Yeah.

68
00:07:06,126 --> 00:07:07,659
Good luck.
Thanks baby.

69
00:07:07,661 --> 00:07:09,528
I love you.
I love you too.

70
00:07:10,129 --> 00:07:13,331
Uh princess.
Aren't you forgetting something?

71
00:07:13,333 --> 00:07:16,501
Bye dad.
Good Luck.

72
00:07:16,669 --> 00:07:18,036
Yeah.
See yeah tonight.

73
00:07:18,038 --> 00:07:21,273
Be good.
I will.

74
00:07:31,184 --> 00:07:34,453
Only a small tremor.
It's perfectly normal here in Naple.

75
00:07:34,455 --> 00:07:35,787
All over now. I promise.

76
00:07:36,322 --> 00:07:39,758
Uh, I'm sure it is.
Excuse me a second.

77
00:07:40,026 --> 00:07:44,896
Uh look, you guys don't have to go.
Why don't you just stay around the hotel?

78
00:07:44,898 --> 00:07:47,532
Stay close. See Naple.

79
00:07:48,868 --> 00:07:50,469
You still wanna go baby?

80
00:07:50,471 --> 00:07:53,972
Yeah. I mean how many chances
am I gonna get to see Pompeii?

81
00:07:53,974 --> 00:07:58,677
Right. Ok don't worry.
I'll keep us safe.

82
00:07:58,679 --> 00:08:00,312
Hmm. I sure you will baby.
All right.

83
00:08:00,314 --> 00:08:01,980
All right, Tickets?
Yeah.

84
00:08:01,982 --> 00:08:04,249
You look after your mother.

85
00:08:04,383 --> 00:08:07,552
Yeah dad.
And before I forget...

86
00:08:09,088 --> 00:08:11,690
You might want to take
these just in case.

87
00:08:11,692 --> 00:08:14,593
Sat Phones?
Yeah Sat. phones.

88
00:08:14,827 --> 00:08:18,530
With GPS Tracking.
Satellite phones with GPS tracking?

89
00:08:18,532 --> 00:08:21,433
Really Jeff?
I got clearance on them.

90
00:08:21,435 --> 00:08:24,736
Dad, you do this every time.
You freak out, get over protective

91
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:26,738
and do your whole soldier thing.

92
00:08:26,740 --> 00:08:29,941
Smart phones can actually loose
battery or you could be in an area--

93
00:08:29,943 --> 00:08:32,377
Dad come on are you serious?
Ok ok ok ok!

94
00:08:32,379 --> 00:08:36,114
We'll take the phones.
At ease soldier.

95
00:08:36,249 --> 00:08:38,116
Come on mom we're
gonna miss the tour.

96
00:08:39,218 --> 00:08:41,186
You...

97
00:08:41,587 --> 00:08:45,557
worry too much.
Easy with that finger.

98
00:08:45,559 --> 00:08:46,458
Ok.

99
00:08:54,267 --> 00:08:56,001
Paul.

100
00:08:56,003 --> 00:08:58,470
Look it's Italy. I was looking
forward to carnet and cappuccino.

101
00:08:58,472 --> 00:09:00,438
We shouldn't have over
slept this morning.

102
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,131
Hey! Glad you could join us.

103
00:09:03,157 --> 00:09:06,403
You're just in time to be herded
aboard the cattle express.

104
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:08,980
Yeah come in. Ok Welcome.

105
00:09:10,082 --> 00:09:13,118
Be nice. I'm sorry he's grumpy
without his morning coffee.

106
00:09:13,120 --> 00:09:15,954
Oh that's ok. The hearding
is our favorite part.

107
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,422
Moo.

108
00:09:17,424 --> 00:09:20,725
God mom.
I'm Christine. This is Paul.

109
00:09:20,727 --> 00:09:24,529
I am Lynne and this is my
embarrassed daughter Mykaela.

110
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:26,431
I guess we are all on
the same boat today.

111
00:09:26,433 --> 00:09:27,499
Or bus I suppose.

112
00:09:27,501 --> 00:09:29,301
Yeah, from a dump to a ruin.

113
00:09:29,303 --> 00:09:32,404
Eey!
I think I'm a like this guy.

114
00:09:34,273 --> 00:09:36,975
Oh. Ok.

115
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,845
Come come inside. Ok. Welcome.

116
00:09:51,424 --> 00:09:54,826
Come come.

117
00:09:54,828 --> 00:09:57,562
Welcome, to Pompeii.

118
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,946
Now...

119
00:10:14,948 --> 00:10:17,983
We all know what cause Pompeii
to fall to ruin, yes?

120
00:10:17,985 --> 00:10:19,084
Yes.

121
00:10:19,086 --> 00:10:23,355
The eruption. The Volcano.
And there she is.

122
00:10:23,357 --> 00:10:25,857
Mount vesuvius.

123
00:10:33,966 --> 00:10:35,700
Yes of course.

124
00:10:35,702 --> 00:10:38,536
Mount vesuvius explode and
covered the city in ash.

125
00:10:38,538 --> 00:10:44,009
But can anyone tell me when the volcano
exploded and destroyed our beautiful Pompeii?

126
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,711
Yes miss?
79 A.D.?

127
00:10:46,713 --> 00:10:48,346
<i>Pefecto</i> Miss.

128
00:10:48,348 --> 00:10:51,049
Can you tell us more
about Vesuvius?

129
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:55,220
Uh ok. It's probably the most
dangerous volcano in the world.

130
00:10:55,222 --> 00:10:57,422
Because 3 million
people live near by,

131
00:10:57,424 --> 00:11:00,025
All though there is some dispute
about the name, it's likely a

132
00:11:00,027 --> 00:11:03,662
hybridized Greek and Latin
word meaning "unquenchable".

133
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,731
<i>Perfecto.</i> feel free to explore.

134
00:11:07,700 --> 00:11:10,669
Mount Vesuvius has erupted
more than 50 times.

135
00:11:10,671 --> 00:11:14,873
The eruption in 79 A.D. was
the most famous, of course.

136
00:11:14,875 --> 00:11:17,609
The dust "Poured across
the land" like a flood,

137
00:11:17,611 --> 00:11:21,413
one witness wrote, and shrounded
the city in " a darkness...

138
00:11:21,415 --> 00:11:24,582
liked the black of closed
and unlighted room.

139
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:29,354
Two thousand people died, and the city
was abandoned for almost as many years.

140
00:11:29,356 --> 00:11:34,526
It wasn't until 1748 that a group
of explorers rediscovered the site,

141
00:11:34,528 --> 00:11:37,095
surprised to find that
underneath a thick layer of

142
00:11:37,097 --> 00:11:41,766
dust and debris Pompeii
was perfectly intact.

143
00:11:52,145 --> 00:11:54,145
Follow me. Throughfare!

144
00:11:55,414 --> 00:11:56,448
Move!

145
00:11:58,818 --> 00:11:59,984
Watch out!

146
00:12:36,489 --> 00:12:38,690
Hey honey.
Did you feel that?

147
00:12:38,692 --> 00:12:41,426
Yes we felt it.
Everything ok?

148
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:43,261
Ok?

149
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:45,864
Some of the ruins collapsed. I think
even some of the people are hurt.

150
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:47,298
Are you and Mykaela ok?

151
00:12:47,300 --> 00:12:51,302
Yeah we're fine. We're fine.
Mykalea and I are fine.

152
00:12:51,304 --> 00:12:54,005
I don't want you to
worry about that baby.

153
00:12:54,007 --> 00:12:57,008
Look, I'm going to reschedule.
I'm gonna come get you guys.

154
00:12:57,010 --> 00:13:01,346
No honey. Really, we're fine.

155
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:03,815
We're just shooken up
a bit, that's all.

156
00:13:03,817 --> 00:13:08,720
I'm sure we're gonna be back on the bus
and back in town any minute now, ok?

157
00:13:08,854 --> 00:13:12,557
You sure?
I'm positive.

158
00:13:12,559 --> 00:13:15,794
I do not want you to
miss that meeting baby.

159
00:13:17,463 --> 00:13:20,331
Mykaela wants to talk to you.
We'll see you tonight.

160
00:13:20,333 --> 00:13:24,169
How are you guys? Ok?
Is there any place to get a coffee dude?

161
00:13:24,171 --> 00:13:25,370
Love you.

162
00:13:26,238 --> 00:13:29,140
Hi dad.
Hey princess.

163
00:13:29,142 --> 00:13:32,744
You ok?
Yeah I'm fine.

164
00:13:32,746 --> 00:13:36,447
But?
What is it?

165
00:13:38,250 --> 00:13:43,221
This morning at the news stand I saw that
there had been an eruption in the Galapagos.

166
00:13:44,557 --> 00:13:47,659
They said there's been
seismic activity everywhere.

167
00:13:48,327 --> 00:13:49,627
But then...

168
00:13:51,397 --> 00:13:55,800
I have read so many times that there's
always activity near an active volcano.

169
00:13:56,068 --> 00:13:59,137
What are you saying? Do you think
you and your mom are in danger?

170
00:14:01,807 --> 00:14:07,011
No. No. Everything's fine.
I'm just being paranoid dad.

171
00:14:07,013 --> 00:14:09,747
No no no princess.
That's all right.

172
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:11,216
Look...

173
00:14:11,218 --> 00:14:13,218
I'll call you when I'm done, ok?

174
00:14:13,220 --> 00:14:16,287
Dad seriously, everything is fine.
Don't panic.

175
00:14:16,289 --> 00:14:18,790
Really, me and mom
have it under control.

176
00:14:19,859 --> 00:14:23,127
Good luck.
Ok thanks. You and mom be safe.

177
00:14:23,129 --> 00:14:25,363
Bye dad.
Bye princess.

178
00:14:25,564 --> 00:14:27,866
And make sure you keep
those sat. phones--

179
00:14:29,368 --> 00:14:32,103
Hello?
Hello?

180
00:14:33,205 --> 00:14:36,140
Everything ok?
Yeah.

181
00:14:55,227 --> 00:14:58,029
Mr. Pierce.
Very pleased to meet you.

182
00:14:58,031 --> 00:15:00,431
I'm Victtore Fabricio, Senior
Vice President of operations.

183
00:15:00,433 --> 00:15:02,166
Please call me Jeff, sir.

184
00:15:02,168 --> 00:15:06,170
Wonderful. Uh this way. Mr. Rosso
and the others are waiting.

185
00:15:10,442 --> 00:15:12,477
Gianni.
Yes.

186
00:15:12,479 --> 00:15:14,312
How do we get out of this place?

187
00:15:14,314 --> 00:15:16,948
We'll try the entrance first.
If that doesn't work we try Porta Sarno.

188
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:18,816
The gate by the--
By the amphitheater.

189
00:15:18,818 --> 00:15:21,519
Hey, on the other side of the city.

190
00:15:21,820 --> 00:15:23,021
Ok.

191
00:15:23,023 --> 00:15:25,023
Here, this way.

192
00:15:30,095 --> 00:15:31,062
Lynne.

193
00:15:31,132 --> 00:15:34,724
I must confess. I am amazed
at your daughter's knowledge

194
00:15:34,750 --> 00:15:37,302
of the city and our
fearsome volcano.

195
00:15:38,004 --> 00:15:42,807
Yeah she does her best to keep
us amazed. That's for sure.

196
00:15:42,809 --> 00:15:46,611
Tell me, how is it you are
so drawn to volcanoes?

197
00:15:46,613 --> 00:15:50,348
My dad was away a lot when
I was a kid. Marines.

198
00:15:50,350 --> 00:15:54,352
Whenever he went away somewhere I'd read
everything I could about the place he was

199
00:15:54,354 --> 00:16:00,224
stationed. Everything from local customs,
to the way the land was formed.

200
00:16:00,392 --> 00:16:05,730
Knowing about where he was, really
did make me feel closer to him.

201
00:16:05,732 --> 00:16:10,368
The more I read, the more I realized how
much I loved learning about the earth.

202
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:14,339
While other girls were playing with
dolls, I was playing with rocks.

203
00:16:17,109 --> 00:16:18,843
There is much to study in Italy.
Perhaps one day you can come

204
00:16:18,845 --> 00:16:21,713
live with us when you
are a famous geologist.

205
00:16:22,014 --> 00:16:24,115
I would die to live in Italy.

206
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:32,190
That's another small one right?
Perhaps we should...

207
00:16:38,530 --> 00:16:39,998
Go! Quickly.

208
00:16:53,345 --> 00:16:56,514
RUN!

209
00:17:01,220 --> 00:17:05,356
I of course could Implement it and
have it up and running in 3 months.

210
00:17:05,591 --> 00:17:07,759
Seems like a plan.
Ok

211
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:24,008
Mio dio!
Vesuvius.

212
00:17:36,055 --> 00:17:38,756
Do you have a helicopter?
Excuse me?

213
00:17:38,758 --> 00:17:40,158
Does this company
have a helicopter?

214
00:17:40,160 --> 00:17:43,895
Mr. Pierce.
I need to use it.

215
00:17:45,631 --> 00:17:48,232
Mr. Rosso my family is in Pompeii.

216
00:17:48,400 --> 00:17:50,968
I'm sorry but I cannot.
Not for this.

217
00:17:51,170 --> 00:17:54,505
If you try to fight Vesuvius
you will die. I promise you.

218
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:59,210
Jeff, please you have to listen to Mr. Rosso.
You cannot go to Pompeii.

219
00:18:18,597 --> 00:18:21,732
Mykaela?
Mom?

220
00:18:22,501 --> 00:18:23,935
That's bad.

221
00:18:38,952 --> 00:18:41,319
Honey, you there?

222
00:18:41,321 --> 00:18:45,323
Jeff. We're ok but the volcano has--

223
00:18:45,325 --> 00:18:48,826
I know. You gotta find shelter.
Somewhere sturdy with cover.

224
00:18:48,828 --> 00:18:51,362
Find it. I'll be there soon.

225
00:18:52,397 --> 00:18:53,898
Are you guys alright?
Is everything ok?

226
00:18:53,900 --> 00:18:57,401
I don't think you should.
No. Stay there. I'm coming for you.

227
00:18:57,403 --> 00:18:59,637
I love you Jeff but--

228
00:19:01,040 --> 00:19:03,674
Lynne.
Jeff?

229
00:19:03,676 --> 00:19:05,176
Lynne!

230
00:19:05,178 --> 00:19:07,912
Jeff?
Dammit!

231
00:19:08,547 --> 00:19:11,149
Stay away Jeff.

232
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,649
Come on. come on.
Move move move. Thank you.

233
00:19:58,597 --> 00:19:59,864
Excuse me sir?

234
00:20:03,069 --> 00:20:07,638
No I have to get through here.
Get back. No one gets through.

235
00:20:07,640 --> 00:20:11,576
My wife and daughter are in Pompeii.
I have to get through.

236
00:20:11,578 --> 00:20:14,545
Pompeii?
Pompeii is ground zero.

237
00:20:14,547 --> 00:20:17,648
No one is going there.
Get back in your car.

238
00:20:17,650 --> 00:20:20,818
No you don't understand,
I have to get there.

239
00:20:21,653 --> 00:20:23,955
Back in car now.

240
00:20:23,957 --> 00:20:25,623
Easy buddy.

241
00:20:27,293 --> 00:20:30,528
Back in car or I arrest you.
Go.

242
00:20:36,768 --> 00:20:39,036
You play nintendo.

243
00:21:11,204 --> 00:21:13,771
Hello Carlo,
Yeah I'll be right there.

244
00:21:13,773 --> 00:21:16,874
Dammit! Come on!
Ok Yeah.

245
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,191
Carlo.

246
00:21:34,193 --> 00:21:37,028
God no one's called me
that in a few years.

247
00:21:37,030 --> 00:21:39,463
My dear friend it's good to see you.
You too.

248
00:21:39,465 --> 00:21:41,732
Despite the circumstances.
Tell me something good.

249
00:21:41,734 --> 00:21:43,604
As soon as I got your call,
I sent out a

250
00:21:43,630 --> 00:21:45,703
request to the top of
the Italian Government.

251
00:21:45,705 --> 00:21:48,339
There's no go I'm afraid.
This is a--

252
00:21:48,341 --> 00:21:51,175
Pompeii is strictly off limits.
The whole area is off limits.

253
00:21:51,177 --> 00:21:53,377
We are on stand by
to evacuate Naples.

254
00:21:53,379 --> 00:21:55,251
No no no no, you don't
understand this is my

255
00:21:55,277 --> 00:21:57,081
wife and daughter we're
talking about here.

256
00:21:57,083 --> 00:21:59,183
You think I don't understand that?
You think I don't remember that debt

257
00:21:59,185 --> 00:22:03,454
I owe you from Canada. I tell you
this is a major international crisis.

258
00:22:03,456 --> 00:22:05,222
I would help you if
there was anyway--

259
00:22:05,224 --> 00:22:07,992
There is a way. there's always a way.
You know that. You're special ops.

260
00:22:07,994 --> 00:22:12,663
I was special ops in the days when
I was Carlo. Now I'm Colonel Dylard.

261
00:22:12,665 --> 00:22:14,899
Nato liaison. I'm a pen pusher.

262
00:22:14,901 --> 00:22:16,834
You're the same guys.

263
00:22:16,836 --> 00:22:19,070
Come on Carlo. Come on man.

264
00:22:21,673 --> 00:22:24,442
There's also something
else you don't know...

265
00:22:25,344 --> 00:22:26,410
How bad?

266
00:22:27,813 --> 00:22:31,182
I just spoke to the head of
science at Sapienza di Roma.

267
00:22:31,184 --> 00:22:35,619
Pompeii will be under sixty
feet of lava within four hours.

268
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:38,989
Sorry.

269
00:22:40,058 --> 00:22:42,393
Come on. Get in.
Where am I going?

270
00:22:44,196 --> 00:22:45,663
Where are you going?

271
00:22:47,332 --> 00:22:51,435
There's nothing we can do. You
can't stop the bloody volcano man.

272
00:23:21,233 --> 00:23:22,166
Come on.

273
00:23:34,479 --> 00:23:35,346
Get down!

274
00:24:20,358 --> 00:24:22,359
Don't touch it! Go!

275
00:24:23,094 --> 00:24:24,094
Here!

276
00:24:27,966 --> 00:24:28,866
Come on!

277
00:24:31,002 --> 00:24:33,604
Is that safe?
It's safer then out here.

278
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:36,774
Go!

279
00:25:27,058 --> 00:25:28,225
Over there.

280
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,303
That's it.
You're gonna be alright.

281
00:25:41,840 --> 00:25:43,340
Mom.

282
00:25:45,443 --> 00:25:46,844
I'll be fine.

283
00:25:56,455 --> 00:25:58,088
It looks really bad.

284
00:25:59,891 --> 00:26:00,925
Oh my god.

285
00:26:03,795 --> 00:26:07,798
You realize these guys will give you the
same answer as the Italian Government?

286
00:26:08,099 --> 00:26:09,300
Still gotta try.

287
00:26:11,102 --> 00:26:13,537
Right. But if you get the answer that
I think they're going to give you,

288
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:16,473
I'll wait outside for you.
And meet you in an hour.

289
00:26:16,475 --> 00:26:17,641
Ok.

290
00:26:20,579 --> 00:26:21,879
What are you planning?

291
00:26:21,881 --> 00:26:25,883
Plan B. Just in case your
plan A doesn't plan out.

292
00:26:25,885 --> 00:26:29,320
I'm not the only person in
Italy that owes you a favor.

293
00:26:29,588 --> 00:26:32,690
Good luck old boy.
Thanks.

294
00:26:38,163 --> 00:26:39,163
Right.

295
00:26:40,632 --> 00:26:45,002
Next time I say "Let's go get coffee".
Let's go get coffee.

296
00:26:45,004 --> 00:26:48,138
Here let me help you.
Thank you.

297
00:26:53,278 --> 00:26:57,281
Hey. Here.
You saved my life out there.

298
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,584
We were just in the neighborhood.
Thanks.

299
00:27:01,620 --> 00:27:04,188
I'm Naveen. And that's Rashida.

300
00:27:04,422 --> 00:27:07,524
I'm Lynne.
Mykaela.

301
00:27:24,542 --> 00:27:27,878
Thank you.
It's a hell of a day huh?

302
00:27:28,179 --> 00:27:29,213
Tell me about it.

303
00:27:30,482 --> 00:27:32,316
This morning Naveen said that
he felt something important

304
00:27:32,318 --> 00:27:35,786
was gonna happen to us today.
Me and my big mouth huh?

305
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,555
Hey.
There ya go.

306
00:27:39,891 --> 00:27:40,791
Thanks man.

307
00:27:44,529 --> 00:27:47,398
Next time I won't visit
a natural disaster.

308
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:50,367
If there's even a next time.

309
00:27:50,568 --> 00:27:51,702
Paul!

310
00:27:53,304 --> 00:27:55,939
I can't be the only
one thinking that.

311
00:27:57,375 --> 00:27:58,275
Hey.

312
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:01,078
You ok?

313
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:04,214
Yeah.
I guess.

314
00:28:05,183 --> 00:28:07,885
It was really lucky that
you found this place, ok?

315
00:28:07,887 --> 00:28:09,987
It's exactly what your
dad said to find.

316
00:28:09,989 --> 00:28:13,257
You did really good.
You did really good baby.

317
00:28:13,259 --> 00:28:15,259
In theory we should be ok here.

318
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:17,528
It withstood the last
eruption after all.

319
00:28:17,530 --> 00:28:20,497
Unless it's worse this time.
Worse?

320
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,666
Can it really get any worse?

321
00:28:26,906 --> 00:28:29,339
Mr. Pierce please believe me.
We'd like nothing better then to

322
00:28:29,341 --> 00:28:31,075
assist you in locating your
wife and your daughter.

323
00:28:31,077 --> 00:28:34,011
All I'm asking for
is transport sir.

324
00:28:34,212 --> 00:28:36,447
Believe me Captain,
I don't doubt your ability

325
00:28:36,449 --> 00:28:39,717
but as I said, it's not that easy.
It is. That easy.

326
00:28:39,719 --> 00:28:41,919
It is not that easy. You heard
what your friend said CO said.

327
00:28:41,921 --> 00:28:44,354
Word from the Italian government,
is that everybody is coming out.

328
00:28:44,356 --> 00:28:46,457
Nobody is going in. Certainly
no civilians. God only knows

329
00:28:46,459 --> 00:28:48,392
how they feel about some
black ops commando--

330
00:28:48,394 --> 00:28:51,028
Exactly. I'm black ops. I can
make this a cougar operation.

331
00:28:51,030 --> 00:28:53,530
Sir please, believe me we're
trying to keep you safe.

332
00:28:53,532 --> 00:28:57,468
This is my wife and daughter.
Mr. Pierce I get it.

333
00:28:57,470 --> 00:28:59,036
We're talking about a
volcanic eruption.

334
00:28:59,038 --> 00:29:02,606
I've done it before. Many times.
That's my job!

335
00:29:02,608 --> 00:29:07,544
Look I want to help you. Really I do.
Neither you or I can stop a volcano.

336
00:29:07,779 --> 00:29:09,780
<i>We are now receiving
reports from Niihau Hawaii,</i>

337
00:29:09,782 --> 00:29:12,549
<i>where a ring of volcanoes
have risen from the ocean,</i>

338
00:29:12,551 --> 00:29:15,319
<i>endangering air traffic
and local population...</i>

339
00:29:15,321 --> 00:29:17,654
In a little over 3 hour
Pompeii will be gone.

340
00:29:17,989 --> 00:29:21,225
Right now the only thing I can
do is try and keep you safe.

341
00:29:21,227 --> 00:29:23,127
That's it. I'm sorry.

342
00:29:23,261 --> 00:29:27,765
That's what we're dealing with.
So you are not gonna help me.

343
00:29:27,767 --> 00:29:30,534
No Mr. Pierce I can't.

344
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:36,707
We're heading out of Naples in an hour.
I f you're you'll be coming with us.

345
00:29:36,841 --> 00:29:39,009
If not...

346
00:29:39,944 --> 00:29:41,512
God help you man.

347
00:29:55,460 --> 00:29:59,763
You guys have everything in those packs.
Our whole lives are in there.

348
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:04,067
We've been backpacking through
Europe for the past 3 months.

349
00:30:07,338 --> 00:30:10,340
Naveen is hard to persuade when
he gets an idea in his head.

350
00:30:10,942 --> 00:30:13,243
Like you were
putting up a fight.

351
00:30:14,012 --> 00:30:15,779
Are you two married?

352
00:30:17,182 --> 00:30:19,850
Uh, not quite yet. No.

353
00:30:19,852 --> 00:30:20,918
It's complicated.

354
00:30:26,457 --> 00:30:29,193
Are you getting a signal with that?
No.

355
00:30:30,962 --> 00:30:34,042
Then you might want to conserve your
battery when we get signal at some point.

356
00:30:38,671 --> 00:30:41,705
Really?
What's your deal dude?

357
00:30:41,707 --> 00:30:44,830
Oh sorry. I work for a
travel blog back home.

358
00:30:44,856 --> 00:30:47,477
Just fly around the world,
take photos

359
00:30:47,479 --> 00:30:53,584
of tourist traps.
My first trip to Italy. It's exciting.

360
00:30:56,387 --> 00:30:58,755
Hey...

361
00:30:58,757 --> 00:31:00,657
Did you hear that?

362
00:31:02,861 --> 00:31:05,629
What?
I don't hear anything?

363
00:31:06,497 --> 00:31:07,598
I think it stopped.

364
00:31:09,200 --> 00:31:10,434
I don't think so.

365
00:31:12,904 --> 00:31:13,804
Well?

366
00:31:15,106 --> 00:31:18,075
Looks like I'm on my own.
Oh no you're not.

367
00:31:26,517 --> 00:31:30,354
You work fast.
Good guys have friends.

368
00:31:32,724 --> 00:31:33,690
We are not much.

369
00:31:34,859 --> 00:31:36,627
You're all the paper
pushers you could dig up.

370
00:31:36,629 --> 00:31:38,595
Yeah the best I could
do at short notice.

371
00:31:38,730 --> 00:31:41,765
Good to see you soldier.
Captain Pierce.

372
00:31:42,233 --> 00:31:45,903
Look what the cat dragged in.
Always looking for work.

373
00:31:45,905 --> 00:31:48,405
I'm glad I'm not doing
this on my own. Cane.

374
00:31:48,407 --> 00:31:49,567
Never leave you hanging boss.

375
00:31:49,583 --> 00:31:51,975
The old band's officially back
together for one night only.

376
00:31:51,977 --> 00:31:54,144
We hear you got a problem?

377
00:31:54,812 --> 00:31:57,114
Yeah. The size of a mountain.
Your family?

378
00:31:58,383 --> 00:31:59,883
They're at ground zero.
We're getting them out.

379
00:32:00,051 --> 00:32:01,818
Come on. Let's go.

380
00:32:04,389 --> 00:32:05,889
I can't thank you enough.

381
00:32:05,891 --> 00:32:08,058
It was the least I could do.
There is much I still owe you.

382
00:32:08,060 --> 00:32:10,294
Thank. Oh um,

383
00:32:10,428 --> 00:32:12,462
There is one thing. Anything.
Anything at all.

384
00:32:12,464 --> 00:32:15,766
Could you get me a chopper?
Military grade?

385
00:32:15,768 --> 00:32:20,337
Are you out of your mind? I'm Nato
liaison. This isn't even my country.

386
00:32:20,339 --> 00:32:22,239
I will get me court Martial.

387
00:32:22,407 --> 00:32:24,975
Alright alright. You're right.
You're absolutely right.

388
00:32:25,176 --> 00:32:28,378
I'll figure it out.
Yes, I'm sure you will.

389
00:32:28,746 --> 00:32:29,762
Good luck.

390
00:32:30,988 --> 00:32:32,107
Good luck.

391
00:32:32,984 --> 00:32:35,229
Dinner when you come home.

392
00:32:37,055 --> 00:32:38,300
If you come home.

393
00:32:38,426 --> 00:32:40,223
We got gear?
Locked and loaded. The whole kit,

394
00:32:40,225 --> 00:32:42,793
but lacking the caboodle. We're gonna
need some kind of a conveyance.

395
00:32:42,795 --> 00:32:45,295
Yeah. We're gonna get a chopper.
We need something large enough

396
00:32:45,297 --> 00:32:49,222
to hold cargo for transport and extraction,
plus we need to land on a dime.

397
00:32:49,248 --> 00:32:53,070
Basically means we need something fast
and agile to ge us out of trouble.

398
00:32:53,438 --> 00:32:54,891
It's gonna be a war
zone out there.

399
00:32:54,917 --> 00:32:56,732
I could call us a favor
to the British Army.

400
00:32:56,841 --> 00:33:00,777
No, we don't have time. Ah! Damn!
Back it up. Back it up!

401
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:03,447
So we need to secure a chopper
here in Naples, and fast.

402
00:33:03,449 --> 00:33:04,781
Yep.

403
00:33:04,783 --> 00:33:06,149
I'm guessing, civilian option
is out of the question.

404
00:33:06,151 --> 00:33:09,052
Any ideas?
Yeah.

405
00:33:09,520 --> 00:33:11,888
I know that look.
What are you planning?

406
00:33:11,890 --> 00:33:13,890
Something Carlo is not gonna like.

407
00:33:39,050 --> 00:33:40,334
If there are many
more of that size,

408
00:33:40,360 --> 00:33:42,444
I don't know whether this
villa is gonna hold.

409
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:49,559
Ok were else can we go Mykaela?

410
00:33:49,561 --> 00:33:52,996
Sweetie you have been reading books about
volcanoes as long as I can remember.

411
00:33:52,998 --> 00:33:54,998
Can you think of some place else?

412
00:33:55,000 --> 00:33:58,535
So place that's safer?
Crap. Wait.

413
00:33:58,537 --> 00:34:00,504
Christine, do you still
have that map of Pompeii?

414
00:34:00,506 --> 00:34:02,339
Yes. Yes I do.

415
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:09,746
Right. So...

416
00:34:12,450 --> 00:34:13,950
We are here.

417
00:34:13,952 --> 00:34:16,253
We need to get to here.

418
00:34:16,255 --> 00:34:18,288
We should get ready
to move like now!

419
00:34:18,290 --> 00:34:20,457
We need to get there
before what happens next.

420
00:34:20,459 --> 00:34:24,127
Why? What happens next?
You don't want to know.

421
00:34:24,129 --> 00:34:28,065
Tell us.
The heat surge.

422
00:34:28,067 --> 00:34:30,367
How much heat are we talking?

423
00:34:30,369 --> 00:34:31,935
Enough.

424
00:34:38,377 --> 00:34:40,877
Everybody go! Now!

425
00:34:41,446 --> 00:34:44,347
Mom! Run!

426
00:34:46,651 --> 00:34:48,251
Here.
What's that?

427
00:34:48,253 --> 00:34:52,122
Just take it.
Come on. Go. Go Go.

428
00:35:06,572 --> 00:35:07,771
Paul!

429
00:35:27,291 --> 00:35:30,460
Where are we headed?
The only place that has the ride me need.

430
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:33,630
JFC Naples?
Isn't that a NATO base?

431
00:35:33,632 --> 00:35:36,800
Yeah it's an Italian Post.
It's the hard way.

432
00:35:36,802 --> 00:35:40,403
As usual.
Just the way I like it.

433
00:35:42,473 --> 00:35:45,075
Oh come on.
Take a right here.

434
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,153
Come on!

435
00:35:49,779 --> 00:35:51,182
How much time do we have?

436
00:35:51,284 --> 00:35:53,850
According to Carlo, only a
couple of hours. Hold on hold on.

437
00:35:54,886 --> 00:35:55,852
Let's have a look.

438
00:35:58,122 --> 00:35:59,923
Let's help him with that car.
Come on.

439
00:36:02,126 --> 00:36:04,694
Jeff stop.
You hear that?

440
00:36:05,963 --> 00:36:07,864
Looks like we should have
actually stayed home.

441
00:36:09,834 --> 00:36:13,136
We need to move.
Incoming!

442
00:36:25,984 --> 00:36:28,251
Move! Move! Move! Move!

443
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:10,827
Ok.
So the rocks have stopped.

444
00:37:11,862 --> 00:37:12,829
That's good right?

445
00:37:14,298 --> 00:37:15,398
It's good if you don't want to
be hit by flaming rocks but,

446
00:37:15,400 --> 00:37:18,635
It's not good if you don't like heat.
We need to keep moving.

447
00:37:18,637 --> 00:37:20,537
How much further?
Not far.

448
00:37:32,917 --> 00:37:34,551
The roof is intact.

449
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,854
Come on. Everyone inside.

450
00:38:01,078 --> 00:38:02,078
Whoa.

451
00:38:02,513 --> 00:38:06,750
This looks like a death trap to me.
We can see the entrance from here.

452
00:38:07,285 --> 00:38:10,086
Why can't we just keep going?
We don't have time.

453
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,089
When the heat surge hits, there
is no way we could out run it.

454
00:38:13,357 --> 00:38:17,460
What? Are we just suppose to believe you?
You will do well to listen to her.

455
00:38:17,462 --> 00:38:21,498
Alright. Listen to the girl that almost
got us killed inside a collapsing ruin.

456
00:38:21,500 --> 00:38:25,368
There's nothing falling from the sky?
This is our chance to get out of here.

457
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,671
Please come with us.

458
00:38:31,108 --> 00:38:34,277
Wait guys, seriously.
Please. Come on.

459
00:38:41,052 --> 00:38:45,422
I mean, they're kinda right.
It's really small in here.

460
00:38:51,195 --> 00:38:53,430
Good?
Yeah.

461
00:38:53,964 --> 00:38:57,200
Better then I expected.
We need to shut this door.

462
00:38:58,502 --> 00:39:01,271
It will help to block the
heat wave, when it hits.

463
00:39:01,505 --> 00:39:05,375
Ok Mykaela, are you sure
that this is alright?

464
00:39:05,910 --> 00:39:08,478
In 1902 a volcano
erupted on martinique.

465
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:11,948
There was only one survivor...
a man in a jail cell.

466
00:39:13,718 --> 00:39:17,120
Everybody unpack or take off
the close you don't need.

467
00:39:17,321 --> 00:39:20,457
I need your water too.
Sure.

468
00:39:22,360 --> 00:39:23,760
Thanks. Thanks mom.

469
00:39:24,161 --> 00:39:26,129
Here.
Thanks.

470
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,300
Wait. What are you doing with the water?
We may need this.

471
00:39:30,434 --> 00:39:32,902
I need to soak the clothes to
plug the cracks on the door.

472
00:39:33,337 --> 00:39:35,739
That's what the survivor or
Martinique did to stay alive.

473
00:39:36,040 --> 00:39:38,975
Except he had to
use his own urine.

474
00:39:40,044 --> 00:39:41,177
Hmm.

475
00:39:45,549 --> 00:39:46,316
Thanks.

476
00:39:59,530 --> 00:40:01,364
What do you think cap.?

477
00:40:01,366 --> 00:40:05,602
We're not gonna catch them with
their pants down. But there are gaps.

478
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:07,570
What do you think?
Destruction or evasion?

479
00:40:07,572 --> 00:40:10,373
A little of both.
So give us the run down.

480
00:40:10,375 --> 00:40:12,142
Targets one o'clock.

481
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:16,212
Those choppers are exactly what we need.
They're gunships not rescue vehicles.

482
00:40:16,214 --> 00:40:18,782
They won't be used for any
civilian rescue operation.

483
00:40:18,784 --> 00:40:22,018
We're not hurting the rescue effort.
Right.

484
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:24,621
We're just adding some fire power. Once
we get into the air and over Pompeii,

485
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:28,091
It'll be just like being back in the
sand box... only a little worse.

486
00:40:28,093 --> 00:40:31,594
Exactly. It's why we have
to be in the offensive.

487
00:40:31,596 --> 00:40:34,464
How do we get in?
We find a whole in the perimeter.

488
00:40:34,466 --> 00:40:37,267
Then we stealth in, but we'll need
a distraction on the outside.

489
00:40:37,269 --> 00:40:40,637
I'll cover that part.
Saved me from asking.

490
00:40:40,639 --> 00:40:44,459
You know me, I just like blowing things up.
Game on. When do we move?

491
00:40:44,485 --> 00:40:48,979
How about now? Time's a ticking.
And uh, minimal force.

492
00:40:49,281 --> 00:40:50,747
Keep your heads down.

493
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,958
<i>This is why I listen to you.</i>

494
00:41:01,960 --> 00:41:06,796
<i>I expect that to be tattooed on
your forehead when we get home.</i>

495
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:21,778
This is it.
The surge.

496
00:41:26,485 --> 00:41:29,419
Mykaela.
Yeah mom.

497
00:41:31,622 --> 00:41:37,527
I am so proud of you. baby.

498
00:41:37,728 --> 00:41:38,828
Mom.

499
00:41:38,830 --> 00:41:42,699
You are the best... best child

500
00:41:42,701 --> 00:41:44,968
anyone could have ever asked for.

501
00:41:48,240 --> 00:41:50,106
I love you so much.

502
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:56,813
I'm sorry Rashida.

503
00:41:59,183 --> 00:42:00,450
It's not your fault.

504
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:05,455
Look, if we make it out
of this, I promise...

505
00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,591
I know.

506
00:43:00,077 --> 00:43:01,277
Oh my god.

507
00:43:04,449 --> 00:43:07,350
Oh my god.
We made it.

508
00:43:09,086 --> 00:43:10,286
That was it?

509
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:14,657
I mean...

510
00:43:16,261 --> 00:43:20,229
This doesn't seem real.
None of this makes any sense.

511
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:30,373
It's over now, right?

512
00:43:31,609 --> 00:43:33,876
We can rest up here
for a few minutes.

513
00:43:36,480 --> 00:43:38,047
That's the worst of it, right?

514
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:42,151
Come on!

515
00:43:52,596 --> 00:43:54,163
This is far from over.

516
00:44:12,016 --> 00:44:14,684
I feel naked doing this
in broad daylight.

517
00:44:14,818 --> 00:44:17,153
You're loosing your
nerve hurricane?

518
00:44:17,155 --> 00:44:18,688
Hell no.

519
00:44:25,863 --> 00:44:28,798
Sorry Carlo. Do it.

520
00:44:56,727 --> 00:44:59,395
I know, he's late.
Any minute now.

521
00:45:00,764 --> 00:45:02,165
It should be about time now.

522
00:45:06,104 --> 00:45:08,004
That our cue. Come on.

523
00:45:37,935 --> 00:45:40,803
Come on baby.
Start off for me.

524
00:45:51,783 --> 00:45:54,617
We gotta go!
I know I know, I'm on it.

525
00:46:00,924 --> 00:46:01,724
Hold on.

526
00:46:08,298 --> 00:46:09,499
Alright here we go.

527
00:46:35,092 --> 00:46:36,159
Oh my god.

528
00:46:40,931 --> 00:46:45,001
So. Tell us who's
the volcano expert.

529
00:46:45,769 --> 00:46:47,236
Who we gonna die next.

530
00:46:48,839 --> 00:46:51,439
Our main concern is the sulfuric gas.
For the time being at least.

531
00:46:51,775 --> 00:46:56,479
Deadly in high doses, we'd have to be near
a lot of ash to pose an immediate threat.

532
00:46:56,481 --> 00:46:58,581
How much ash?

533
00:46:58,715 --> 00:47:01,751
A lot of ash, like 10 feet of more.

534
00:47:04,288 --> 00:47:05,521
We have to go now.

535
00:47:09,293 --> 00:47:10,026
Hey.

536
00:47:12,629 --> 00:47:14,389
What is it? I could tell
it's something else?

537
00:47:14,498 --> 00:47:18,601
Nothing anyone else
has to worry about.

538
00:47:19,136 --> 00:47:25,541
Mykalea if there is more danger I think
we all need to know about it ok?

539
00:47:25,909 --> 00:47:29,135
It's just if Vesuvius
decides to erupt again,

540
00:47:29,161 --> 00:47:32,106
it's gonna get worse
with every eruption.

541
00:47:32,249 --> 00:47:36,452
How much worse?
Ever heard of crackatoa?

542
00:47:54,872 --> 00:47:55,972
Alright, where is he?

543
00:48:00,277 --> 00:48:00,977
There.

544
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:05,281
Let's pick him up.

545
00:48:07,885 --> 00:48:08,751
Alita, open up.

546
00:48:11,855 --> 00:48:14,757
Come on. Come on.
Come on cowboy.

547
00:48:16,760 --> 00:48:18,461
Hey hey hey hey.

548
00:48:21,932 --> 00:48:24,200
You ok soldier?
Thanks.

549
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:26,469
Are come on. Hold on hold on.

550
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:29,538
We're off.

551
00:48:30,807 --> 00:48:33,943
This is more fun the taking
kabul from the taliban.

552
00:48:38,749 --> 00:48:40,616
He's gonna bleed out.

553
00:48:44,454 --> 00:48:45,354
You alright cane?

554
00:48:50,328 --> 00:48:51,227
Thanks Cade.

555
00:48:52,262 --> 00:48:55,423
Just don't pass out till we get there.
Actually don't pass out till we get back.

556
00:48:58,001 --> 00:49:02,605
That's why you call me hurricane.
Cause I'm unstoppable baby.

557
00:49:02,607 --> 00:49:06,142
No they call you hurricane
because you are full of hot air.

558
00:49:06,977 --> 00:49:10,813
Alright guys come on. Let's focus.
Cane, I need you up here.

559
00:49:13,084 --> 00:49:14,150
Come on.

560
00:49:23,293 --> 00:49:26,028
Alita you're on coms.
Copy that.

561
00:49:26,830 --> 00:49:28,130
You good?

562
00:49:28,132 --> 00:49:30,232
Five by five. Good ahead
and had her to me captain.

563
00:49:32,035 --> 00:49:33,903
She's all yours.
I've got it.

564
00:49:35,172 --> 00:49:38,908
What's our ETA?
We should be there in 35 minutes.

565
00:49:39,810 --> 00:49:43,412
Keep her floored.

566
00:49:53,023 --> 00:49:56,425
Well I'll be dammed.
Well alright.

567
00:49:56,793 --> 00:49:57,693
Come on everybody.

568
00:50:01,531 --> 00:50:04,467
Having any luck?
You never know.

569
00:50:05,502 --> 00:50:08,738
Mom, the sat phones.
Yeah, well...

570
00:50:08,740 --> 00:50:13,275
I think I lost mine back at the Villa.
It's ok, I still go...

571
00:50:14,644 --> 00:50:17,113
Must have fall out when I fell.

572
00:50:19,816 --> 00:50:21,650
Well we're quite a
pair, aren't we?

573
00:50:22,853 --> 00:50:24,620
What do you think?

574
00:50:26,056 --> 00:50:29,525
I don't know.
Seems right.

575
00:50:29,527 --> 00:50:32,528
I think we should go in.

576
00:50:32,530 --> 00:50:35,097
Are you ok?
Yeah yeah I'm fine. Don't worry.

577
00:50:35,099 --> 00:50:37,833
Are you sure?
It's ok.

578
00:50:37,835 --> 00:50:38,734
Come on.

579
00:50:44,442 --> 00:50:46,308
What now?

580
00:50:48,845 --> 00:50:49,979
Mud slide!

581
00:50:50,113 --> 00:50:52,648
Go go go!

582
00:50:55,419 --> 00:50:58,421
Just go!
Come on!

583
00:50:58,889 --> 00:51:00,589
Just go! Go!

584
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:44,834
I'm sorry.

585
00:51:56,079 --> 00:51:57,179
I'm so sorry.

586
00:52:12,996 --> 00:52:14,697
The mud slide brought
in a lot of ash.

587
00:52:16,800 --> 00:52:19,902
That means there's gonna be a--
What?

588
00:52:20,937 --> 00:52:23,038
Volcanic ash that you were
talking about earlier?

589
00:52:24,841 --> 00:52:28,110
And there's a lot of dirt
in there too, right?

590
00:52:28,112 --> 00:52:30,846
Maybe there isn't enough
ash to make it a problem?

591
00:52:30,848 --> 00:52:33,249
Like... like you were saying.

592
00:52:33,383 --> 00:52:36,452
Maybe.
I'm no expert.

593
00:52:36,887 --> 00:52:40,389
I could get us all killed.
No.

594
00:52:40,391 --> 00:52:44,493
Dude, we'd be dead already
if it wasn't for you.

595
00:52:45,729 --> 00:52:48,898
None of us know jack
about volcanoes.

596
00:52:49,566 --> 00:52:51,367
We're following you.

597
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,205
It's gonna be ok.
Ok.

598
00:53:00,043 --> 00:53:03,812
So...
What's our next move boss?

599
00:53:07,417 --> 00:53:08,651
I'm not sure.

600
00:53:17,495 --> 00:53:19,995
Dammit.
Nothing.

601
00:53:24,768 --> 00:53:27,469
Um...
Hey guys.

602
00:53:29,005 --> 00:53:30,773
We've got company.

603
00:53:33,977 --> 00:53:36,412
How the hell are they gaining on us.
They're all the same helicopter, right?

604
00:53:36,414 --> 00:53:38,180
What's our speed?

605
00:53:38,182 --> 00:53:39,949
I'm cracking and banking. I don't
know what the hell is going on.

606
00:53:39,951 --> 00:53:41,417
Maybe they have jettisoned ballast.
Or maybe they're more outfitted

607
00:53:41,419 --> 00:53:43,652
for attack instead of transport.

608
00:53:44,020 --> 00:53:48,424
Or maybe we stole the slowest god
damn helicopter in the Italian army.

609
00:53:54,931 --> 00:53:56,365
Cade! Secure that door.

610
00:53:58,935 --> 00:54:02,204
What? I was just gonna take a few shots.
Get them off our back.

611
00:54:02,206 --> 00:54:06,141
A lot can happen with a grenade launcher.
I'm not killing innocent soldiers.

612
00:54:07,611 --> 00:54:15,584
Please be advised we have instructions
to return you to base at once.

613
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:20,889
Please be advised that we are under
orders shoot if you will not comply.

614
00:54:21,291 --> 00:54:22,685
Do you understand?

615
00:54:22,811 --> 00:54:29,065
We will shoot you out of the
sky, unless you turn around now.

616
00:54:29,367 --> 00:54:33,469
Jeff, please don't do this. Return
to base with us immediately.

617
00:54:34,137 --> 00:54:36,071
I'm sorry Carlo I have too.

618
00:54:40,176 --> 00:54:43,479
Sir, we are almost within
firing distance, sir.

619
00:54:43,481 --> 00:54:46,482
Fire a couple warning shots.
Fire now.

620
00:54:46,916 --> 00:54:48,284
Cane, how far are we?

621
00:54:48,286 --> 00:54:49,985
I could get us to that
cloud with in 3 minutes.

622
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:52,288
But they are gonna be
within firing range in 1.

623
00:54:54,859 --> 00:54:56,625
I think they're in
firing range now.

624
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,827
Yeah.
Crap.

625
00:55:00,096 --> 00:55:01,697
When I said warning shots
I didn't mean hit him!

626
00:55:01,699 --> 00:55:03,666
Do you understand?
Yes sir.

627
00:55:03,668 --> 00:55:04,600
Right!

628
00:55:04,602 --> 00:55:07,503
Will not happen again sir.
It will not happen again sir.

629
00:55:07,505 --> 00:55:10,472
Other wise they can
get court martialed.

630
00:55:10,474 --> 00:55:14,276
Should I pursue though sir?
Pursue pursue.

631
00:55:14,278 --> 00:55:16,011
You are instructed to pursue.

632
00:55:18,048 --> 00:55:21,617
You use every trick you got. But you
get us into that cloud, got it?

633
00:55:21,619 --> 00:55:24,186
You guys might wanna
buckle up for this part.

634
00:55:42,372 --> 00:55:45,407
Good job. 2 left.
Almost within firing range sir.

635
00:55:45,409 --> 00:55:48,977
Wait wait wait wait. Thinks about this.
If you fire

636
00:55:48,979 --> 00:55:53,382
now, any shots that you miss
could hit the civilian population

637
00:55:53,384 --> 00:55:57,586
trying to leave a volcanic
eruption down below.

638
00:55:57,588 --> 00:56:01,156
My advise would be close up.
Yes sir.

639
00:56:01,424 --> 00:56:04,460
I got this. Crap.

640
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:10,933
No no no no, when I say pull up,
I don't mean fly up his ass.

641
00:56:25,582 --> 00:56:29,084
Ok. Let's see who's got
the biggest cojones.

642
00:56:31,254 --> 00:56:33,756
Cane!
You really have to do this?

643
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,357
Yeah he does.

644
00:56:45,034 --> 00:56:48,804
If he jigs left, let him go.
Too many civilians are out there.

645
00:56:48,806 --> 00:56:50,539
If he jigs right,
you could shoot.

646
00:56:50,541 --> 00:56:54,042
Uh sir, the microphone is on sir.
Mic was--

647
00:56:54,044 --> 00:56:55,644
Yeah.

648
00:56:55,779 --> 00:56:57,946
My apologies.
Hey it happens sir.

649
00:56:59,315 --> 00:57:02,117
2 to 3 hotel, be advised we
have a firing solution on you.

650
00:57:02,119 --> 00:57:04,820
They got a lock.
Oh no they don't.

651
00:57:05,288 --> 00:57:06,755
1-0-6

652
00:57:06,757 --> 00:57:08,657
Did you see that? Did you see that...
Yes sir.

653
00:57:08,659 --> 00:57:12,594
That's a commuter aircraft.
That is a civilian in the area.

654
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:14,763
Whatever you do, abort abort abort.

655
00:57:14,765 --> 00:57:18,233
Aborting sir. Aborting
1-0-6 returning.

656
00:57:18,235 --> 00:57:20,569
Alright.
Take us there.

657
00:57:23,072 --> 00:57:24,072
We've got company.

658
00:57:56,606 --> 00:57:58,040
How's your ankle?

659
00:58:02,645 --> 00:58:03,612
It will be alright.

660
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:56,458
This reminds me of the night raids
on Baghdad during the Gulf War.

661
00:59:57,226 --> 00:59:58,961
Only this is much worse.

662
00:59:59,495 --> 01:00:02,331
That's weird.
This reminds me of hell.

663
01:00:03,600 --> 01:00:06,001
We should be over Pompeii in 15.

664
01:00:06,669 --> 01:00:09,404
Uh so when we get there, how the
hell are we gonna find them?

665
01:00:09,406 --> 01:00:12,307
They are not likely to
be out in the open.

666
01:00:12,309 --> 01:00:15,677
And ruins. There is a lot of ground
to cover in the little time we have.

667
01:00:15,679 --> 01:00:19,081
Before Mykaela and Lynne left I made
them take Sat. phones with them.

668
01:00:20,617 --> 01:00:21,850
So we can just call.

669
01:00:22,285 --> 01:00:24,353
No good. have been trying
since we left Naples.

670
01:00:25,355 --> 01:00:29,257
All the phones have GPS tracking.
They tether to one another.

671
01:00:30,760 --> 01:00:32,327
Provided that they
are all functional.

672
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:42,971
Bingo.
One of them is still up.

673
01:00:42,973 --> 01:00:44,172
The coordinates.

674
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:02,891
Mykaela.
Are you down here?

675
01:01:14,837 --> 01:01:15,704
Hey mom.

676
01:01:18,841 --> 01:01:19,741
You ok?

677
01:01:22,512 --> 01:01:26,415
Yeah. I just got a
bit of a headache.

678
01:01:32,155 --> 01:01:34,456
There.
The Pompeii Museum.

679
01:01:35,091 --> 01:01:35,791
Good.

680
01:01:37,493 --> 01:01:40,762
Cane. When we get to Pompeii look for
a free standing 4 story building.

681
01:01:40,764 --> 01:01:43,432
It shouldn't be too hard to find.
Roger that.

682
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:46,468
We have 45 minutes
left for extraction.

683
01:01:47,336 --> 01:01:49,471
Don't worry Cap.
We'll find them.

684
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,449
Where's Christine?

685
01:02:14,397 --> 01:02:15,363
Christine!

686
01:02:24,273 --> 01:02:25,607
Christine!

687
01:02:30,813 --> 01:02:32,347
Mykaela.

688
01:02:36,419 --> 01:02:37,619
We have to go!

689
01:02:39,088 --> 01:02:42,324
Everyone! We have to go! Now!

690
01:02:45,094 --> 01:02:46,361
Mom

691
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,464
Mom

692
01:02:49,466 --> 01:02:51,566
Breathe. Kai Help me.
Come on.

693
01:02:52,502 --> 01:02:54,636
Where's Christine?
Follow me.

694
01:02:56,806 --> 01:02:58,373
This way!

695
01:03:09,752 --> 01:03:10,585
Quick!

696
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,258
Does anyone have any clothes that I
can use. I need clothes and water!

697
01:03:31,841 --> 01:03:33,281
Help me tear this
cloth into strips.

698
01:03:40,449 --> 01:03:43,685
Keep the baking soda over your
mouth and breath through that, ok?

699
01:03:43,687 --> 01:03:45,921
It should absorb that gas
which is in the air.

700
01:03:48,591 --> 01:03:49,724
In theory.

701
01:04:09,279 --> 01:04:10,512
What the hell was that?

702
01:04:17,286 --> 01:04:19,554
Mom it's your phone!
This is yours?

703
01:04:21,290 --> 01:04:23,024
I thought it was one of those electronic
tour guide things or something--

704
01:04:23,026 --> 01:04:26,595
I think dad's been trying to track us.
Come on. We need to get to higher ground.

705
01:04:48,985 --> 01:04:49,951
Sir.

706
01:04:51,988 --> 01:04:55,190
What is it? Do you still have contact?
Negative. The connection is gone.

707
01:04:55,192 --> 01:04:56,091
Damn.

708
01:04:57,526 --> 01:04:59,661
Doesn't change anything.
We still start at the museum.

709
01:04:59,663 --> 01:05:01,463
Same plan. Eye on the prize.

710
01:05:15,044 --> 01:05:16,011
Jesus.

711
01:05:23,452 --> 01:05:25,892
You guys get strapped in. We're
gonna be coming in really hot.

712
01:05:26,689 --> 01:05:28,990
Double time. Come on.
Come on!

713
01:05:37,566 --> 01:05:38,633
This thing is solid.

714
01:05:52,281 --> 01:05:53,848
At least it's keeping
the gas out.

715
01:06:13,936 --> 01:06:17,205
Another earthquake?
Not this time.

716
01:06:22,144 --> 01:06:25,513
You don't happen to have any
dynamite in that bag, do you?

717
01:06:25,515 --> 01:06:27,649
Not even a firecracker.

718
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,852
Ok, well we've gotta
do something.

719
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:34,589
Dad was certainly searching us on the
sat phone before it got smashed.

720
01:06:34,591 --> 01:06:37,158
It had to be him.
He knows where we are.

721
01:06:37,293 --> 01:06:38,994
Do you think that the
signal went through?

722
01:06:38,996 --> 01:06:40,161
It's possible.

723
01:06:40,429 --> 01:06:42,530
If there's a way,
Jeff will find it.

724
01:06:43,632 --> 01:06:46,868
And the way you keep talking
about this dude, makes him sound

725
01:06:46,870 --> 01:06:49,304
like some sort of super
hero or something.

726
01:06:49,306 --> 01:06:51,940
Yeah well, he kinda is.

727
01:06:52,341 --> 01:06:56,911
Hey I'm the first to get in line
to get rescued by super dad.

728
01:06:57,046 --> 01:07:00,448
He'll be here. I know it.
It's too dangerous.

729
01:07:01,751 --> 01:07:04,952
She's right. There's the slightest chance
in hell that he can get to us, he will.

730
01:07:05,187 --> 01:07:09,791
That's what he did for a
living for god sakes.

731
01:07:09,793 --> 01:07:13,361
How we doing Cane?
Touchdown 90 seconds boss.

732
01:07:14,296 --> 01:07:16,931
Alright.
Let's do this.

733
01:07:24,140 --> 01:07:28,410
Look, even if he is coming the bad news
is that we can't stay here much longer.

734
01:07:28,412 --> 01:07:31,012
That second eruption a few
minutes ago, that means that

735
01:07:31,014 --> 01:07:35,383
there is a chance of a pyroclastic flow.
A what?

736
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:40,021
When a volcano erupts, it can heat up
a rock so hot that it turns into gas.

737
01:07:40,023 --> 01:07:42,557
That creates a flow that washes
over the ground kind of like

738
01:07:42,559 --> 01:07:46,895
Like a tidal wave.
It's probably dangerous, right?

739
01:07:47,763 --> 01:07:51,766
According to the books,
it can travel 450 miles per hour.

740
01:07:52,201 --> 01:07:56,638
And reach temperature of 4,000
degrees Celsius so, kinda.

741
01:07:58,007 --> 01:08:00,341
Still no contact?
No.

742
01:08:00,343 --> 01:08:02,177
Alright, we gotta assume they
are still at the museum.

743
01:08:02,179 --> 01:08:05,547
We have less then 30 minutes to get in
there, find them, and get the hell out.

744
01:08:05,549 --> 01:08:07,615
I want it done in 10.
Copy?

745
01:08:07,617 --> 01:08:09,084
Yeah.
Copy.

746
01:08:09,086 --> 01:08:12,687
Alright. Visibility is less them
zero, so I need the flashlights.

747
01:08:14,623 --> 01:08:15,984
You better hit the ground running.

748
01:08:16,859 --> 01:08:19,627
Cane, do you have enough
room to land on the roof?

749
01:08:19,762 --> 01:08:22,430
The structure seems sound enough
but I'm not risking a touchdown.

750
01:08:22,432 --> 01:08:25,266
I'm gonna keep it right above and
keep the engine running for ya.

751
01:08:25,268 --> 01:08:27,135
Alright copy. Let's go.

752
01:08:31,974 --> 01:08:35,977
10 minutes.We search every inch
and then we're gone, copy?

753
01:08:35,979 --> 01:08:37,412
Copy.
Copy.

754
01:08:37,414 --> 01:08:38,680
Alright. Let's go.

755
01:08:54,931 --> 01:08:57,966
It's dad.
It's gotta be!

756
01:08:58,267 --> 01:08:59,467
It has to be.

757
01:09:01,804 --> 01:09:04,205
Lynne! Mykaela!

758
01:09:10,579 --> 01:09:11,379
Guys.

759
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:14,482
Let's do this already.

760
01:09:16,519 --> 01:09:19,554
They will find us and they
will get us out of here.

761
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:24,592
But how can you know that?
I know my husband.

762
01:09:32,501 --> 01:09:35,837
5 more minutes please.
5 more minutes.

763
01:09:39,175 --> 01:09:42,177
Lynne!
Mykaela!

764
01:09:43,112 --> 01:09:44,412
Check those rooms over there.

765
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:56,291
Hello?

766
01:10:01,197 --> 01:10:02,263
Mrs. Pierce?

767
01:10:03,299 --> 01:10:06,401
Lynne! Mykaela!
Jeff!

768
01:10:10,172 --> 01:10:12,073
Are you in there?
Dad!

769
01:10:13,142 --> 01:10:16,678
Hey! Hey we're right here!
You guys in there?

770
01:10:16,680 --> 01:10:19,147
We're here!
We're in here!

771
01:10:20,015 --> 01:10:21,316
Alright what happened?

772
01:10:21,517 --> 01:10:25,420
The roof caved in, we can't get through.
Alright, everyone stay calm.

773
01:10:25,422 --> 01:10:27,155
We'll have you outta there
in a couple of minutes.

774
01:10:27,157 --> 01:10:28,056
Ok.

775
01:10:29,491 --> 01:10:33,661
Alita! Cade! On my 20 everyone!
I found them!

776
01:10:34,396 --> 01:10:35,163
Let's go.

777
01:10:36,966 --> 01:10:40,046
We gotta go. We don't sit here any longer.
This is... We got to go! We gotta go.

778
01:10:40,703 --> 01:10:42,237
Alright.

779
01:10:43,339 --> 01:10:46,841
So behind this wall. Roof caved
in, we gotta make a hole.

780
01:10:46,843 --> 01:10:49,978
Tell me we have something for that.
Always come prepared, right Cap?

781
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:52,413
25 seconds.

782
01:10:56,919 --> 01:11:00,288
Could be dead for all I know.
We got to get out of here.

783
01:11:02,424 --> 01:11:06,060
Alright, I need you all to move away
from the door as far away as possible.

784
01:11:06,062 --> 01:11:07,829
Take cover.
We got it dad.

785
01:11:09,098 --> 01:11:10,331
Good. Look, we are going to
try to make an exit for you.

786
01:11:10,333 --> 01:11:13,101
You need to move away from the door.
Move fast!

787
01:11:13,103 --> 01:11:16,604
As far away as you can.
You got 25 seconds.

788
01:11:17,906 --> 01:11:20,475
Now!
Run! Run!

789
01:11:21,310 --> 01:11:22,610
Go, go, go!

790
01:11:24,647 --> 01:11:28,016
Kai! What are you doing?
Help me!

791
01:11:28,018 --> 01:11:29,284
What are you doing?
Help me.

792
01:11:29,418 --> 01:11:30,852
You heard the man, take cover.

793
01:11:33,757 --> 01:11:34,856
Get down!

794
01:11:38,494 --> 01:11:40,128
Any minute. They gotta get here.

795
01:11:49,505 --> 01:11:52,473
Dad!
Lynne! Mykaela!

796
01:11:57,413 --> 01:12:00,181
Dad!
Ok. Everybody ok?

797
01:12:00,183 --> 01:12:02,550
Alright come on. We gotta go.
Come on. Come on!

798
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:05,019
Come on!
Come on!

799
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:07,355
Come on!

800
01:12:11,026 --> 01:12:12,527
Come. Guys.

801
01:12:20,703 --> 01:12:22,770
Ok. Hurricane! Hurricane!

802
01:12:26,175 --> 01:12:27,709
Bring her in! Bring her in!

803
01:12:29,545 --> 01:12:32,714
That's what I'm talking about.
Let's go baby. Let's go.

804
01:12:35,551 --> 01:12:38,019
I can't believe you guys are still alive.
It was all Mykaela.

805
01:12:38,821 --> 01:12:39,687
She kept us going.

806
01:12:52,902 --> 01:12:54,268
Hurricane! Come on!

807
01:12:59,042 --> 01:13:00,608
Ah man!

808
01:13:13,355 --> 01:13:16,257
Come on.
You straight?

809
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:19,394
We straight?
Good good good!

810
01:13:19,396 --> 01:13:20,395
What now?

811
01:13:20,996 --> 01:13:24,999
There's always another way. Let's find it.
Looks like we need another ride, huh?

812
01:13:25,001 --> 01:13:28,736
She ain't kidding bro!
Incoming!

813
01:13:32,775 --> 01:13:33,441
Cade!

814
01:13:47,623 --> 01:13:49,624
The pyroclastic flow.

815
01:13:53,462 --> 01:13:56,464
It has to be.
We need to take cover, now!

816
01:13:56,466 --> 01:13:59,534
How far does this museum go?
There's a basement, I saw it earlier.

817
01:13:59,536 --> 01:14:01,536
Alright. All the way down.
Move move move!

818
01:14:01,538 --> 01:14:04,605
Move come on! Let's go!

819
01:14:04,607 --> 01:14:05,873
Go go go go!

820
01:14:06,074 --> 01:14:08,876
It's gonna be ok. Ok?
Ok go!

821
01:14:13,782 --> 01:14:14,348
Come on.

822
01:14:14,983 --> 01:14:16,384
Go go go come on!

823
01:14:17,553 --> 01:14:18,686
Go go go come on!

824
01:14:30,232 --> 01:14:31,232
Go go go!

825
01:14:41,911 --> 01:14:44,912
Here. You're alright sweetie.
Is everyone alright?

826
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,380
Yeah.

827
01:14:48,183 --> 01:14:52,386
So what do we do now man?
Just chill out down here?

828
01:14:53,789 --> 01:14:57,258
Is this place even safe?
I hope so.

829
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:07,869
Good thing about being in a tomb,
hopefully nothing will get in.

830
01:15:32,995 --> 01:15:33,794
Anything?

831
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:41,269
Straighten up soldier.
You know the risks.

832
01:15:44,206 --> 01:15:45,406
Give me that you jerk.

833
01:15:47,676 --> 01:15:49,577
Easy alright? Easy.

834
01:16:02,024 --> 01:16:03,591
Come on.
Let's take a look at that leg.

835
01:16:08,030 --> 01:16:10,364
Here we go. What have you done.
Huh?

836
01:16:10,366 --> 01:16:12,700
What have you done? Are you alright?
Can you put any weight on it?

837
01:16:12,702 --> 01:16:13,801
Just a little.

838
01:16:15,070 --> 01:16:17,605
So volcano experts what do we do now?
Any way outta here?

839
01:16:17,607 --> 01:16:18,806
Just the way we came in.

840
01:16:20,676 --> 01:16:23,244
So how long before
this thing is over?

841
01:16:24,947 --> 01:16:26,013
I don't know.

842
01:16:26,582 --> 01:16:29,650
Days. Maybe.
Days?

843
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:33,154
Can't wait days.
We'll suffocate in here.

844
01:16:34,556 --> 01:16:37,036
There must be a way to get word out.
To get someone to help us.

845
01:16:37,459 --> 01:16:40,027
I'll find way out of here.
Alright?

846
01:16:53,909 --> 01:16:57,878
Hey. Stairwell! Everyone out now!

847
01:17:02,751 --> 01:17:03,618
Come on!

848
01:17:07,990 --> 01:17:10,891
Come on we gotta get out!
No!

849
01:17:12,060 --> 01:17:13,694
No Alita No!

850
01:17:15,897 --> 01:17:17,665
Come on Come on!

851
01:17:26,675 --> 01:17:28,309
Go cane go!

852
01:17:44,593 --> 01:17:45,426
Dad, what do we do?

853
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:00,341
Climb. Everyone Climb! Go!

854
01:18:02,010 --> 01:18:02,576
Come on!

855
01:18:07,883 --> 01:18:08,582
Wait!

856
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:11,786
Help me!

857
01:18:13,555 --> 01:18:14,455
Give me your hand!

858
01:18:26,535 --> 01:18:28,035
It's alright! Come on!

859
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:33,407
Come on! Move!

860
01:18:49,324 --> 01:18:51,892
Dad, I'm so sorry.
For what?

861
01:18:53,161 --> 01:18:54,261
For making you come here.

862
01:18:55,931 --> 01:18:59,500
You have nothing to be sorry
about. Ok? I'm proud of you.

863
01:18:59,634 --> 01:19:00,501
Ok.

864
01:19:16,251 --> 01:19:18,986
What's happening?
I don't know.

865
01:19:20,021 --> 01:19:21,501
I haven't read about
this in my books.

866
01:19:25,561 --> 01:19:26,861
That sounds like a...

867
01:19:28,063 --> 01:19:28,963
There!

868
01:19:32,235 --> 01:19:33,467
Yeah. Cane.

869
01:19:33,869 --> 01:19:34,969
Come on. Come on.

870
01:19:39,241 --> 01:19:40,674
Come on, come on! Move move move!

871
01:19:42,210 --> 01:19:44,879
Go, go, go, go!
You're crazy you know that?

872
01:19:46,047 --> 01:19:49,650
Yes. Hurry up I'm late
for a court-martial.

873
01:19:49,652 --> 01:19:52,887
Come on.
Go go go!

874
01:19:54,122 --> 01:19:55,322
Everyone strap in.

875
01:20:06,434 --> 01:20:08,969
I didn't think you'd come for us.
You maniac.

876
01:20:08,971 --> 01:20:11,906
The only reason why I'm here
is because 25 years ago I was

877
01:20:11,908 --> 01:20:14,656
stuck in a dessert and
extracted by another maniac.

878
01:20:14,682 --> 01:20:16,443
And I didn't even know him!

879
01:20:16,445 --> 01:20:18,646
Our debt s over. Now it's paid.

880
01:20:18,648 --> 01:20:21,882
Paid? ha!
You owe me.

881
01:20:22,484 --> 01:20:23,551
Of course I do.

882
01:20:31,693 --> 01:20:33,093
I didn't see all your team.

883
01:20:36,164 --> 01:20:37,665
We lost Alita and Cade.

884
01:20:41,269 --> 01:20:44,505
Sorry.
Let's get the rest of them home.

885
01:20:44,639 --> 01:20:48,275
Alright. It's got gonna be easy.
If only I could find some soup.

886
01:20:53,982 --> 01:20:54,882
God dammit.

887
01:20:59,387 --> 01:21:03,991
These air filters keep clogging. Come on.
You can do it. Come on!

888
01:21:03,993 --> 01:21:08,495
Is that it?
Yes. Yes! Once we're there.

889
01:21:08,497 --> 01:21:10,030
Carlo!

890
01:21:15,238 --> 01:21:17,805
Fly fly fly.
I'm trying. I'm trying.

891
01:21:20,643 --> 01:21:22,443
I can't control this thing.

892
01:21:29,418 --> 01:21:31,085
Hold on! Hold on!

893
01:21:44,165 --> 01:21:46,901
Doing alright back there?
Yeah.

894
01:21:50,538 --> 01:21:51,572
Carlo?

895
01:21:55,443 --> 01:21:57,845
Captain?
You ok?

896
01:21:59,114 --> 01:22:02,983
Captain? I'm a bloody Colonel.
You damn civilian.

897
01:22:06,722 --> 01:22:09,957
This bloody rock has gone
right through my shoulder.

898
01:22:10,625 --> 01:22:11,992
Cane, front and center.

899
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,696
Bring Colonel Dylard
some first aid.

900
01:22:16,264 --> 01:22:18,766
Right way sir.
And break up a morphine.

901
01:22:21,270 --> 01:22:23,771
This is can all over again.
You are whining like a chicken.

902
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,877
Try flying the plane a
little bit to the left--

903
01:22:29,879 --> 01:22:34,181
I seem to remember fluid
back in kata ara.

904
01:22:34,416 --> 01:22:36,850
And you were still
complaining weren't you?

905
01:22:40,923 --> 01:22:43,995
Give me some morphine
before you...

906
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:45,352
Guys.

907
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:48,022
I don't want to live
in Italy anymore.

908
01:23:53,528 --> 01:23:54,261
Yeah.

909
01:23:56,297 --> 01:23:57,965
<i>Reports are coming in, the
eruptions from Mt. Vesuvious</i>

910
01:23:57,967 --> 01:24:00,801
<i>are dying down, and the series
of earthquakes are dissipating.</i>

911
01:24:00,803 --> 01:24:04,972
<i>While badly damaged from this
disaster, Pompeii is still standing.</i>
