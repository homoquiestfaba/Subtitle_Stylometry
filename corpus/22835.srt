1
00:01:15,320 --> 00:01:18,406
 How long have you
been deaf in this ear?

2
00:01:18,489 --> 00:01:20,867
 Since as long
as I can remember.

3
00:01:20,950 --> 00:01:22,076
-Ow!

4
00:01:22,159 --> 00:01:23,452
 Shut up!

5
00:01:23,536 --> 00:01:26,038
Keep still while the doctor
is examining you.

6
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:27,832
 I need a fish-hook...

7
00:01:27,915 --> 00:01:29,750
about the right size
for a mullet...

8
00:01:29,834 --> 00:01:32,794
with a long shank,
and a hammer.

9
00:01:32,878 --> 00:01:35,088
A fish-hook? A hammer?

10
00:01:35,172 --> 00:01:36,590
Here's a fish-hook...

11
00:01:36,673 --> 00:01:38,425
and a hammer.

12
00:01:38,508 --> 00:01:40,969
 Ahem.

13
00:01:46,807 --> 00:01:50,561
Right. Now keep still.

14
00:01:51,896 --> 00:01:53,105
 Ow!

15
00:01:55,399 --> 00:01:57,234
 A pea.

16
00:01:59,068 --> 00:02:01,946
It is very papilionaceous,
is it not?

17
00:02:02,030 --> 00:02:05,700
He must have stuck it
in his ear when he was a child.

18
00:02:05,783 --> 00:02:07,452
Oh, my God, it's loud.

19
00:02:07,535 --> 00:02:10,371
I mean, everything is loud.
My own voice is loud.

20
00:02:10,455 --> 00:02:14,833
Your deafness is cured.
A very satisfactory operation.

21
00:02:14,917 --> 00:02:16,335
I've had an operation?

22
00:02:16,418 --> 00:02:20,214
Ha! I'm the only person I know
who's had an operation.

23
00:02:20,297 --> 00:02:22,216
It feels as if my whole head...

24
00:02:22,299 --> 00:02:25,219
has filled up with spring water,
all cold and clear.

25
00:02:25,260 --> 00:02:26,802
Talk some sense
when the doctor...

26
00:02:26,844 --> 00:02:28,387
has been kind enough
to cure you.

27
00:02:28,387 --> 00:02:30,723
All these years
thinking you are deaf.

28
00:02:30,806 --> 00:02:34,685
But now there will be no excuses
when I ask you to remember...

29
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,604
to collect something
on your way home.

30
00:02:36,687 --> 00:02:40,191
Or to stoke up the fire
before we go to church.

31
00:02:41,900 --> 00:02:43,610
 Perhaps now
you will hear me...

32
00:02:43,693 --> 00:02:46,321
when I say to you,
"Mend the chair, Stamatis.

33
00:02:46,404 --> 00:02:48,448
"Fix the leaking roof,
Stamatis. "

34
00:02:48,532 --> 00:02:51,660
And now I won't have
to speak so loud...

35
00:03:01,961 --> 00:03:07,633
 Antonio,
do you remember our island?

36
00:03:07,716 --> 00:03:10,885
It does not change.

37
00:03:10,969 --> 00:03:13,847
On the feast day
of Saint Gerasimos...

38
00:03:13,930 --> 00:03:16,224
we still bring our sick
to the holy place...

39
00:03:16,307 --> 00:03:20,228
and pray that
their suffering may cease.

40
00:03:22,813 --> 00:03:26,191
When Pelagia was a child,
I promised her...

41
00:03:26,275 --> 00:03:28,819
that I would write
a history of Cephallonia...

42
00:03:28,902 --> 00:03:34,241
but somehow I still
have not found the time.

43
00:03:34,324 --> 00:03:38,828
I wanted her to understand
how a land so peaceful...

44
00:03:38,911 --> 00:03:42,874
could be shattered
by earthquakes and war.

45
00:03:44,750 --> 00:03:46,752
I wanted her to understand...

46
00:03:46,836 --> 00:03:49,005
why sometimes
the gods bless us...

47
00:03:49,088 --> 00:03:53,008
and why they sometimes
become angry...

48
00:03:53,091 --> 00:03:59,139
and shake us,
and fill our lives with pain.

49
00:03:59,264 --> 00:04:03,852
I want her to learn the lesson
that nature teaches us.

50
00:04:03,935 --> 00:04:07,980
That we should not ask
why we are wounded...

51
00:04:08,063 --> 00:04:12,526
only if the wound
can be healed.

52
00:04:29,876 --> 00:04:32,961
A purely psychological
phenomenon.

53
00:04:33,045 --> 00:04:35,714
 How do you
explain the miracle?

54
00:04:35,797 --> 00:04:39,593
Can Lenin cure the mad?
Can Stalin heal the afflicted?

55
00:04:39,676 --> 00:04:42,304
It's obvious.
It's a set-up!

56
00:04:42,387 --> 00:04:44,598
To keep people
enslaved to religion.

57
00:04:44,681 --> 00:04:45,891
You don't have to shout.

58
00:04:46,016 --> 00:04:47,475
I'm not deaf.

59
00:05:28,763 --> 00:05:32,016
I want to see the cannon again.

60
00:05:32,100 --> 00:05:34,144
-Yeah!
-Cannon!

61
00:05:34,227 --> 00:05:37,480
All right.

62
00:05:37,564 --> 00:05:40,233
I will need stones
from the street.

63
00:05:40,316 --> 00:05:42,402
As many as you can find.

64
00:05:43,694 --> 00:05:44,987
Be right back.

65
00:05:46,655 --> 00:05:48,115
 Ready, children?

66
00:05:48,198 --> 00:05:50,075
Cover your ears.

67
00:06:00,626 --> 00:06:03,754
Ow, that hurts!
Oh, that hurts!

68
00:06:09,760 --> 00:06:11,052
 Will he die?

69
00:06:12,429 --> 00:06:15,682
Eventually, one of these days,
like all of us.

70
00:06:15,765 --> 00:06:17,058
Turn over.

71
00:06:26,775 --> 00:06:30,237
-Aah!
-Good, strong gluteals.

72
00:06:30,321 --> 00:06:32,031
-Pelagia.
-Hmm?

73
00:06:32,114 --> 00:06:33,866
Tell us about the gluteals.

74
00:06:33,949 --> 00:06:36,243
Please, come closer.
Have a good look.

75
00:06:36,327 --> 00:06:40,079
Fetch your friends.
Everybody's welcome.

76
00:06:40,163 --> 00:06:42,207
Gluteals.

77
00:06:42,290 --> 00:06:45,960
Maximus, medius, minimus.

78
00:06:46,085 --> 00:06:48,922
The maximus is the external
surface of the ilium...

79
00:06:49,005 --> 00:06:52,549
between anterior
and interior gluteal lines...

80
00:06:55,177 --> 00:06:56,386
 Mandras!

81
00:06:58,597 --> 00:06:59,723
Iatre...

82
00:06:59,848 --> 00:07:01,809
He'll be fine.

83
00:07:01,892 --> 00:07:05,395
They told me you were shot.
I thought I was going to die.

84
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:07,814
I don't know why you can't
keep out of trouble!

85
00:07:07,897 --> 00:07:09,440
I don't know!

86
00:07:09,524 --> 00:07:12,485
Iatre, you should count yourself
lucky you don't have a son.

87
00:07:12,610 --> 00:07:16,364
Boys, they never grow up.
Look at me.

88
00:07:16,447 --> 00:07:19,450
Old before my time.

89
00:07:20,867 --> 00:07:23,119
 Aah! Aah!

90
00:07:55,233 --> 00:07:56,568
It's too hot.

91
00:07:56,651 --> 00:07:59,737
The fish are all hiding
in the rocks...

92
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:02,865
or keeping cool
at the bottom of the sea.

93
00:08:06,827 --> 00:08:09,872
Aah! No, Mandras!

94
00:08:09,955 --> 00:08:11,582
 Aah!

95
00:08:11,665 --> 00:08:13,750
No! Put me down! Put me down!

96
00:08:13,834 --> 00:08:16,044
-Waah!
-Aah!

97
00:08:16,128 --> 00:08:17,962
-Whoo!
-Aah!

98
00:08:24,177 --> 00:08:25,511
Ha ha!

99
00:08:36,021 --> 00:08:37,522
that a Greek battleship,
the Eli...

100
00:08:37,606 --> 00:08:39,399
has been torpedoed
by an Italian submarine...

101
00:08:39,483 --> 00:08:42,611
despite the fact that Greece
is not yet involved in the war.

102
00:08:42,694 --> 00:08:45,446
Prime Minister Metaxas
has protested strongly...

103
00:08:45,529 --> 00:08:47,156
to Mussolini's government
in Rome...

104
00:08:47,239 --> 00:08:50,201
which has denied
responsibility for the attack.

105
00:08:50,284 --> 00:08:52,119
And there are continued
reports of fighting...

106
00:08:52,244 --> 00:08:53,996
between Greek
and Italian soldiers...

107
00:08:54,079 --> 00:08:55,915
on the Greek-Albanian border.

108
00:08:55,998 --> 00:08:57,541
But in Athens this morning...

109
00:08:57,625 --> 00:08:59,042
the Italian ambassador
once again denied...

110
00:08:59,125 --> 00:09:00,710
What are they saying?

111
00:09:00,793 --> 00:09:03,963
The Italians are in Albania,
close to the border.

112
00:09:04,047 --> 00:09:05,840
They have reported
some fighting.

113
00:09:05,924 --> 00:09:07,550
There! You hear that?

114
00:09:07,634 --> 00:09:10,178
They are saying they are
not about to declare war.

115
00:09:10,261 --> 00:09:11,471
There. What did I say?

116
00:09:11,554 --> 00:09:13,305
They want to catch us sleeping.

117
00:09:13,388 --> 00:09:15,808
They want to creep up on us
in the dead of night!

118
00:09:15,891 --> 00:09:18,685
-You filthy liar!
-Your father was a goat!

119
00:09:18,769 --> 00:09:21,355
Shut up!

120
00:09:21,438 --> 00:09:23,106
If you two don't stop
trading insults...

121
00:09:23,190 --> 00:09:25,150
I'm going to start
taking coffee at home.

122
00:09:29,904 --> 00:09:32,907
Mandras wants to marry me.

123
00:09:32,990 --> 00:09:35,576
I told him
he'd have to ask you.

124
00:09:35,660 --> 00:09:37,620
I don't want to marry him.

125
00:09:37,703 --> 00:09:40,247
You don't like him.

126
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:42,415
You are both too young.

127
00:09:42,499 --> 00:09:46,044
Everyone is too young
when they marry.

128
00:09:46,128 --> 00:09:47,921
I have often thought
that you would...

129
00:09:48,004 --> 00:09:49,589
only ever be able
to marry happily...

130
00:09:49,673 --> 00:09:51,633
with a foreigner.

131
00:09:51,758 --> 00:09:53,218
 A dentist from Norway...

132
00:09:53,301 --> 00:09:55,302
...or something.

133
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:02,017
Mandras is not your equal,
and he would expect...

134
00:10:02,101 --> 00:10:04,520
to be better than his wife.

135
00:10:04,603 --> 00:10:08,106
He is a man, after all.

136
00:10:08,189 --> 00:10:10,984
I will tell you now
what I will say to him.

137
00:10:11,067 --> 00:10:14,195
I am not giving away a dowry.

138
00:10:15,655 --> 00:10:17,365
Who marries without a dowry?

139
00:10:17,448 --> 00:10:19,409
You should marry for love.

140
00:10:19,492 --> 00:10:20,785
I love Mandras.

141
00:10:23,078 --> 00:10:25,747
So what am I supposed to do?

142
00:10:25,831 --> 00:10:27,416
Go off
to Mandras' mother's house...

143
00:10:27,499 --> 00:10:29,585
with nothing
but a bag of clothes?

144
00:10:29,668 --> 00:10:32,629
Oh, and my goat.

145
00:10:32,713 --> 00:10:34,506
I'll never be able
to show my face.

146
00:10:34,590 --> 00:10:37,049
I'll be the laughing stock
of Cephallonia.

147
00:10:37,133 --> 00:10:39,552
You can imagine
how people will talk.

148
00:10:39,677 --> 00:10:42,555
I don't know
how you will bear the shame.

149
00:10:42,638 --> 00:10:46,726
There is going to be a war.
Terrible things happen in wars.

150
00:10:46,809 --> 00:10:49,395
Use this to defend yourself.

151
00:10:49,479 --> 00:10:52,981
And, if necessary,
use it against yourself.

152
00:10:53,064 --> 00:10:55,108
Your marriage
will have to wait.

153
00:10:57,736 --> 00:10:59,362
I look around me.

154
00:10:59,446 --> 00:11:02,491
I see fishermen.
I see farmers.

155
00:11:02,574 --> 00:11:06,076
I see strong, healthy men
who are born free.

156
00:11:06,160 --> 00:11:09,413
But today your freedom
is in danger.

157
00:11:09,497 --> 00:11:11,874
The Italian Army
sweeps through Albania...

158
00:11:11,957 --> 00:11:16,086
and her troops get ready to
cross the frontiers of Greece.

159
00:11:16,170 --> 00:11:17,463
Exo Mussolini!

160
00:11:17,546 --> 00:11:20,256
 Exo Mussolini!

161
00:11:20,340 --> 00:11:22,091
 If you care
about your country...

162
00:11:22,175 --> 00:11:24,177
then you must fight
to defend her.

163
00:11:24,260 --> 00:11:26,095
Join the war in Albania.

164
00:11:26,179 --> 00:11:28,765
Fight for your mothers,
your sweethearts...

165
00:11:28,848 --> 00:11:30,892
your wives, your children.

166
00:11:30,975 --> 00:11:33,769
Fight for the freedom
for all Greek people...

167
00:11:33,852 --> 00:11:36,772
to live their lives
with dignity and respect!

168
00:12:06,049 --> 00:12:07,926
 When I come back
from the war...

169
00:12:07,968 --> 00:12:10,262
we will get married.

170
00:12:10,387 --> 00:12:13,056
And I will build a house
for Pelagia...

171
00:12:13,140 --> 00:12:16,267
on the land
that belonged to my father.

172
00:13:01,851 --> 00:13:03,978
I know we are different.

173
00:13:04,061 --> 00:13:07,148
I don't know about the world.

174
00:13:07,231 --> 00:13:10,984
Where have I been?
What could I know?

175
00:13:11,067 --> 00:13:14,488
I don't know how to say
what I feel inside.

176
00:13:14,571 --> 00:13:15,989
I don't know how to tell you...

177
00:13:16,072 --> 00:13:19,701
what is in here.
But I think...

178
00:13:19,785 --> 00:13:25,289
I know...Pelagia...

179
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:29,585
I love you.

180
00:13:38,593 --> 00:13:42,347
Tomorrow I leave for the war.

181
00:13:42,430 --> 00:13:46,100
Pelagia, come and dance with me.

182
00:14:55,165 --> 00:14:57,500
I'll write. I promise.

183
00:14:59,252 --> 00:15:01,296
And promise that
you will write to me.

184
00:15:23,983 --> 00:15:26,235
 "My darling,
you have not written...

185
00:15:26,319 --> 00:15:28,780
"since that day I saw you off.

186
00:15:28,863 --> 00:15:30,614
"And I am so terrified...

187
00:15:30,697 --> 00:15:32,991
"that I am not getting
any letters from you...

188
00:15:33,074 --> 00:15:36,995
"because you have been
wounded or taken prisoner.

189
00:15:37,078 --> 00:15:40,081
"And I have nightmares
that you are dead. "

190
00:15:43,126 --> 00:15:45,002
"Summer has turned to winter...

191
00:15:45,085 --> 00:15:49,632
"and I am writing
my hundredth letter to you.

192
00:15:49,715 --> 00:15:51,717
"The wounded
who have returned...

193
00:15:51,801 --> 00:15:54,386
"bring news
of terrible conditions.

194
00:15:54,470 --> 00:15:58,097
"Freezing cold, no food.

195
00:15:58,181 --> 00:16:00,266
"But they bring
no news from you. "

196
00:16:04,687 --> 00:16:07,357
"Every day I wait
for the mail from Argostoli...

197
00:16:07,440 --> 00:16:09,776
"and every day
there is nothing.

198
00:16:09,859 --> 00:16:12,820
"And I feel
as if I am going mad...

199
00:16:12,903 --> 00:16:16,990
"with worry and fear.
I try not to lose hope...

200
00:16:17,074 --> 00:16:21,787
"but I long to feel something,
even if it is only pain. "

201
00:16:45,809 --> 00:16:47,769
We won!

202
00:16:47,853 --> 00:16:49,438
We won!

203
00:16:51,481 --> 00:16:53,691
It's over!

204
00:16:53,774 --> 00:16:56,277
We've beaten them in Albania.

205
00:16:56,360 --> 00:16:57,778
Look!

206
00:16:57,862 --> 00:17:00,739
8,000 of us
against 14,000 Italians...

207
00:17:00,865 --> 00:17:02,616
and we forced them to withdraw.

208
00:17:05,578 --> 00:17:07,954
What?

209
00:17:08,037 --> 00:17:11,749
Hitler will never let
his lapdog be humiliated.

210
00:17:11,833 --> 00:17:14,002
He will come to Mussolini's aid.

211
00:17:19,048 --> 00:17:21,217
 "I have written
this letter a dozen times...

212
00:17:21,301 --> 00:17:24,845
"and a dozen times
I have thrown it away.

213
00:17:24,970 --> 00:17:28,640
"I don't know how
to describe my feelings.

214
00:17:28,724 --> 00:17:32,019
"It's as if I've been
waiting a hundred years...

215
00:17:32,102 --> 00:17:33,979
"to hear from you.

216
00:17:34,062 --> 00:17:36,856
"Waiting a hundred years
for you to return. "

217
00:17:44,030 --> 00:17:45,573
Pelagia?

218
00:17:48,409 --> 00:17:50,160
This is hopeless.

219
00:17:50,243 --> 00:17:52,662
It's all wrong!

220
00:17:58,960 --> 00:17:59,836
Following the great defeat...

221
00:18:00,253 --> 00:18:01,671
of the Italians in Albania...

222
00:18:01,755 --> 00:18:03,131
Hitler's bombers
have counterattacked...

223
00:18:03,215 --> 00:18:04,757
and the German Army
has driven a path...

224
00:18:04,840 --> 00:18:07,051
through to
the Greek capital, Athens.

225
00:18:07,134 --> 00:18:08,969
A large number of Greek ships
were destroyed...

226
00:18:09,053 --> 00:18:12,056
in the bombing of the nearby
Port of Piraeus.

227
00:18:12,139 --> 00:18:14,391
On April 27, the Athenian
Military Commissioner...

228
00:18:14,475 --> 00:18:17,228
General Calvacos, officially
handed over the keys...

229
00:18:17,310 --> 00:18:19,020
of the ancient city
to his German counterpart...

230
00:18:19,104 --> 00:18:20,939
Lieutenant Colonel
Von Zephyr...

231
00:18:21,022 --> 00:18:22,315
and preparations
are underway...

232
00:18:22,398 --> 00:18:24,192
for a carve-up
of the territory.

233
00:18:24,275 --> 00:18:26,152
Hitler retains
direct control...

234
00:18:26,236 --> 00:18:28,279
of much of northern Greece,
including Salonica...

235
00:18:28,404 --> 00:18:29,906
and the southern island
of Crete.

236
00:18:29,989 --> 00:18:31,824
The rest of Greece
will be under the control...

237
00:18:31,907 --> 00:18:33,575
of Hitler's ally, Mussolini...

238
00:18:33,659 --> 00:18:36,286
though the Germans will retain
the final authority.

239
00:19:59,530 --> 00:20:02,450
Bella bambina at two o'clock!

240
00:20:37,899 --> 00:20:39,150
Captain Corelli.

241
00:20:45,990 --> 00:20:47,158
Ahem.

242
00:20:47,242 --> 00:20:48,660
"Fuck off."

243
00:20:57,459 --> 00:20:59,711
Have him tell the mayor
that unless we receive...

244
00:20:59,837 --> 00:21:02,423
the surrender of the town's
authorities in five minutes...

245
00:21:02,506 --> 00:21:05,258
we'll mobilise our troops
and storm the building.

246
00:21:06,884 --> 00:21:11,180
The mayor says if you don't
know what "fuck off" means...

247
00:21:11,264 --> 00:21:13,850
then come inside
and we'll show you.

248
00:21:34,326 --> 00:21:38,414
"We refuse to surrender
to a nation...

249
00:21:38,497 --> 00:21:40,875
"that we have defeated
in Albania...

250
00:21:40,958 --> 00:21:43,627
"and we reserve the right
to surrender...

251
00:21:43,753 --> 00:21:46,756
"to a German officer
of significant rank.

252
00:21:46,839 --> 00:21:48,256
"So fuck off."

253
00:22:25,041 --> 00:22:27,710
Who is this? Who are you?

254
00:22:27,752 --> 00:22:30,128
-Captain Gunter Weber.

255
00:22:30,212 --> 00:22:32,214
Liaison officer
with the Grenadiers at Lixouri.

256
00:22:32,297 --> 00:22:35,842
"Captain" is not what we
would call a significant rank.

257
00:22:35,926 --> 00:22:37,344
There are only 200 Germans...

258
00:22:37,469 --> 00:22:38,804
on the island,
and Captain Weber...

259
00:22:38,887 --> 00:22:41,890
is the highest ranking officer
amongst them.

260
00:22:51,398 --> 00:22:54,443
Our decision
is that surrendering...

261
00:22:54,527 --> 00:22:57,320
to Captain Weber's dog
is more appropriate...

262
00:22:57,404 --> 00:23:00,573
than surrendering to an Italian.

263
00:23:35,690 --> 00:23:41,778
 Chi del gitano
i giorni abbella

264
00:23:41,862 --> 00:23:46,992
Chi del gitano
i giorni abbella

265
00:23:47,075 --> 00:23:51,872
Chi i giorni abbella

266
00:23:53,789 --> 00:23:56,250
Carlo Guercio
reporting for duty, sir.

267
00:23:56,333 --> 00:23:59,503
-Carlo, where have you served?
-Albania.

268
00:23:59,587 --> 00:24:01,213
Albania?

269
00:24:01,297 --> 00:24:03,883
None of us have seen
any action yet.

270
00:24:03,966 --> 00:24:05,301
I was with the Julia Division.

271
00:24:09,971 --> 00:24:11,723
Ah.

272
00:24:11,806 --> 00:24:14,392
Then you have fought enough
for all of us.

273
00:24:14,476 --> 00:24:16,770
Carlo, can you sing?

274
00:24:16,853 --> 00:24:18,855
Let's hear you sing.

275
00:24:18,938 --> 00:24:22,274
O mio babbino, caro

276
00:24:22,357 --> 00:24:30,949
Mi piace bello

277
00:24:31,033 --> 00:24:33,410
Bello

278
00:24:34,369 --> 00:24:35,828
No matter.

279
00:24:35,912 --> 00:24:39,624
Everyone in our battery is
a member of the opera society.

280
00:24:39,707 --> 00:24:41,959
These are the rules
of engagement.

281
00:24:42,043 --> 00:24:45,588
One, all those called
to regular musical fatigues...

282
00:24:45,671 --> 00:24:47,799
shall be obliged to play
a musical instrument.

283
00:24:47,882 --> 00:24:49,549
Uh, spoons, the helmet...

284
00:24:49,633 --> 00:24:52,594
comb, paper,
and so on, and so on.

285
00:24:52,677 --> 00:24:54,096
Two, anyone who says...

286
00:24:54,179 --> 00:24:56,681
that Donizetti is better
than Verdi shall be required

287
00:24:56,765 --> 00:25:00,185
to sing "Funiculi Funicula"
and other songs about railways.

288
00:25:00,268 --> 00:25:03,312
Three, um...

289
00:25:03,396 --> 00:25:06,273
three, um...ah.

290
00:25:13,114 --> 00:25:15,825
This is an outrage!
Quite impossible.

291
00:25:15,908 --> 00:25:17,909
It's out of the question.

292
00:25:17,992 --> 00:25:19,911
Sir, the fact is,
I'm sorry to say...

293
00:25:19,994 --> 00:25:22,205
and with great regret,
that my orders are...

294
00:25:22,288 --> 00:25:23,790
to billet an officer
in your home.

295
00:25:23,873 --> 00:25:26,251
I am a doctor.
This is my surgery.

296
00:25:26,376 --> 00:25:27,627
I don't have room for guests!

297
00:25:27,710 --> 00:25:30,171
-Sir, these are my orders!
-I don't care!

298
00:25:30,255 --> 00:25:32,506
I don't recognise
your authority!

299
00:25:36,301 --> 00:25:39,596
Wait a minute.

300
00:25:39,680 --> 00:25:42,766
What is wrong with your feet?

301
00:25:42,850 --> 00:25:44,351
I have terrible corns.

302
00:25:44,435 --> 00:25:45,977
My boots are killing me.

303
00:25:46,060 --> 00:25:47,395
You are a quartermaster.

304
00:25:47,478 --> 00:25:50,481
You must have access
to medical supplies.

305
00:25:50,565 --> 00:25:54,235
To treat your corns,
I will need morphine...

306
00:25:54,318 --> 00:25:56,279
hypodermic syringes,
sulphur ointment...

307
00:25:56,362 --> 00:25:58,406
surgical spirit, neosalvarsan.

308
00:25:58,489 --> 00:26:00,282
Iodine, scalpels, cullodian...

309
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:02,576
bandages, lint.

310
00:26:02,659 --> 00:26:05,162
Perhaps your officer
could bring supplies...

311
00:26:05,245 --> 00:26:06,663
when he comes.

312
00:26:25,848 --> 00:26:28,058
My father is not here.

313
00:26:29,642 --> 00:26:31,811
He'll be home this evening.

314
00:26:34,064 --> 00:26:36,649
You don't even know who I am.

315
00:26:42,988 --> 00:26:44,323
Mandras?

316
00:26:45,991 --> 00:26:50,120
I walked all the way...
from Epirus.

317
00:26:50,204 --> 00:26:51,580
No boots.

318
00:26:55,875 --> 00:26:58,336
I wrote to you every day.

319
00:26:58,419 --> 00:27:00,922
A hundred letters.

320
00:27:01,005 --> 00:27:03,758
And not a single reply.

321
00:27:06,844 --> 00:27:09,596
I never learned...

322
00:27:09,679 --> 00:27:12,140
to read or write.

323
00:27:15,227 --> 00:27:20,273
Oh, Lord, what a stench.
It's worse than pigs.

324
00:27:20,357 --> 00:27:23,109
You see, Pelagia, what a state
these men get into...

325
00:27:23,192 --> 00:27:25,111
when there are no women
to look after them.

326
00:27:25,194 --> 00:27:27,738
And I don't care
if he's been to war.

327
00:27:27,822 --> 00:27:33,077
If we catch his fleas and lice,
I'm going to skin him alive.

328
00:27:33,160 --> 00:27:35,788
Ammonia, oil of sassafras,
and zinc for scabies.

329
00:27:37,747 --> 00:27:42,127
You're a woman and--
and you know so many things.

330
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:45,713
At least you can see
what you are getting.

331
00:27:45,797 --> 00:27:47,757
Not much of a bargain, is he?

332
00:27:47,841 --> 00:27:50,676
You fall in love
with the person, not the body.

333
00:27:50,759 --> 00:27:53,846
Love enters by the eyes
and also leaves by the eyes.

334
00:27:53,929 --> 00:27:55,305
Take it from me.

335
00:27:57,141 --> 00:28:00,018
We beat the Italians.
We had them running.

336
00:28:02,563 --> 00:28:04,522
But we couldn't
fight the Germans.

337
00:28:15,324 --> 00:28:18,035
 If I could cook...

338
00:28:18,119 --> 00:28:21,037
I would exchange jobs with you.

339
00:28:24,207 --> 00:28:26,543
In fact, I might retire.

340
00:28:45,895 --> 00:28:47,479
 Bella bambina!

341
00:28:48,855 --> 00:28:50,857
Forgive me. Forgive me.

342
00:28:50,940 --> 00:28:52,901
I don't mean to embarrass you.

343
00:28:52,984 --> 00:28:55,153
I'm Captain Antonio Corelli...

344
00:28:55,236 --> 00:28:58,323
and that man
is one of our heroes.

345
00:28:58,406 --> 00:29:01,075
He has a hundred medals
for saving life...

346
00:29:01,158 --> 00:29:02,326
and none for taking it.

347
00:29:02,409 --> 00:29:04,286
A brave Italian
is a freak of nature.

348
00:29:04,369 --> 00:29:06,288
Said like a true Greek patriot.

349
00:29:06,371 --> 00:29:08,332
Captain Corelli?

350
00:29:08,415 --> 00:29:10,709
I want a word with you. Now.

351
00:29:10,793 --> 00:29:12,753
I want an explanation.

352
00:29:12,836 --> 00:29:15,546
I want to know why
you have defaced the monument.

353
00:29:15,630 --> 00:29:16,756
What monument?

354
00:29:16,881 --> 00:29:18,674
You have changed
the inscription to Latin.

355
00:29:18,800 --> 00:29:21,761
Do you think you can
so easily erase our history?

356
00:29:21,844 --> 00:29:24,764
Is this how you wage war?
By the chipping away of letters?

357
00:29:24,847 --> 00:29:26,015
I must protest.

358
00:29:26,099 --> 00:29:27,725
You cannot protest.
There is no excuse.

359
00:29:27,809 --> 00:29:30,852
I was about to protest because
I was not responsible for it.

360
00:29:30,936 --> 00:29:32,646
Pathetic.

361
00:29:34,231 --> 00:29:37,401
If you could tell me
where I'm going to sleep...

362
00:29:37,484 --> 00:29:38,902
In my daughter's room.

363
00:29:38,985 --> 00:29:41,196
But where will
your daughter sleep?

364
00:29:41,321 --> 00:29:43,030
It's none of your business
where I sleep.

365
00:29:43,114 --> 00:29:45,074
Ah. Tonight I'll sleep
in the yard.

366
00:29:45,199 --> 00:29:47,618
Tomorrow I'll request
alternative accommodation.

367
00:29:47,701 --> 00:29:49,703
I have made an arrangement
with your quartermaster.

368
00:29:49,787 --> 00:29:52,039
You are staying here
whether you like it or not.

369
00:29:52,123 --> 00:29:54,583
But your daughter's bed,
I feel it would not be--

370
00:29:54,667 --> 00:29:56,167
I don't care how you feel.

371
00:29:56,251 --> 00:29:58,294
That is not my problem.

372
00:29:58,378 --> 00:30:01,756
I am not the aggressor.
You understand me?

373
00:30:10,973 --> 00:30:13,934
This is very good.

374
00:30:14,017 --> 00:30:15,602
This is Cephallonian meat pie.

375
00:30:15,686 --> 00:30:18,021
Except that,
thanks to you people...

376
00:30:18,105 --> 00:30:20,149
it doesn't have any meat in it.

377
00:30:21,900 --> 00:30:23,819
I could bring some food.

378
00:30:23,902 --> 00:30:26,487
A little wine,
perhaps some panettone.

379
00:30:26,571 --> 00:30:29,031
We don't accept food
from the enemy.

380
00:30:29,115 --> 00:30:31,117
Maybe a little panettone.

381
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:38,623
I am going for a walk.

382
00:30:38,707 --> 00:30:41,460
The curfew starts
in one hour's time.

383
00:30:41,543 --> 00:30:44,254
I was born here.

384
00:30:44,337 --> 00:30:46,131
This is my island.

385
00:30:54,472 --> 00:30:57,349
Aren't you going
to go and arrest him?

386
00:30:57,433 --> 00:31:00,936
He's defying you,
ignoring the curfew.

387
00:31:01,020 --> 00:31:02,938
You're absolutely right.

388
00:31:03,022 --> 00:31:06,066
Quick, get the gun.
Somebody shoot him, shoot him.

389
00:31:06,149 --> 00:31:08,443
Ha ha ha ha ha!

390
00:31:29,213 --> 00:31:30,381
Armare!

391
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:36,344
Direzione uno-tre-due.

392
00:31:39,180 --> 00:31:43,393
Alto uno-zèro-cinque.

393
00:31:43,476 --> 00:31:47,647
Capitano Antonio Corelli.

394
00:31:47,730 --> 00:31:49,106
Now you try.

395
00:31:49,189 --> 00:31:52,025
Capitano Antonio Corelli.

396
00:31:52,109 --> 00:31:53,318
 Lemoni!

397
00:31:53,402 --> 00:31:55,862
Babibaba Finono Kalikali.

398
00:31:55,946 --> 00:31:58,824
 Oh, what? Babibaba?

399
00:31:58,907 --> 00:32:03,494
Ha ha ha! Capitano.

400
00:32:03,577 --> 00:32:04,704
 Capitano.

401
00:32:04,829 --> 00:32:05,955
Sì. Antonio.

402
00:32:06,038 --> 00:32:07,206
Lemoni.

403
00:32:07,289 --> 00:32:08,541
 Antonio.

404
00:32:08,624 --> 00:32:10,584
-Corelli.
-Go home.

405
00:32:10,668 --> 00:32:13,713
Go on.
You can come back later.

406
00:32:16,756 --> 00:32:19,884
Signorina...

407
00:32:19,968 --> 00:32:23,179
in times of war,
we have to make the most...

408
00:32:23,263 --> 00:32:25,974
of what little
innocent pleasure there is.

409
00:32:31,311 --> 00:32:34,189
 "I have started
to make a waistcoat for you.

410
00:32:34,273 --> 00:32:39,194
"Eagles and flowers,
embroidered with gold thread.

411
00:32:39,278 --> 00:32:41,864
"But I can't seem
to get them to match up.

412
00:32:41,947 --> 00:32:44,032
"One flower is much bigger.

413
00:32:44,115 --> 00:32:47,785
"One eagle is in a different
place from the other.

414
00:32:47,910 --> 00:32:51,247
"And when I try to make them
more even, it gets worse.

415
00:32:51,330 --> 00:32:53,249
"I just can't get it right."

416
00:32:53,332 --> 00:32:55,585
You could kill him, you know.

417
00:32:57,670 --> 00:33:00,756
He's the enemy.
You could poison him.

418
00:33:00,839 --> 00:33:02,758
No one would ever
know how he died.

419
00:33:04,384 --> 00:33:08,221
Dimitris and Spiros have both
left to join the partisans.

420
00:33:08,305 --> 00:33:11,058
They've gone by boat to Patra.

421
00:33:11,141 --> 00:33:13,893
And who knows where from there.

422
00:33:13,976 --> 00:33:15,686
I should be with them.

423
00:33:15,770 --> 00:33:17,813
You're not going anywhere
until you are strong again.

424
00:33:22,193 --> 00:33:24,987
Read the last one.

425
00:33:25,071 --> 00:33:27,447
The last letter you wrote
before I came home.

426
00:33:35,580 --> 00:33:39,167
"My darling,
I've heard nothing from you...

427
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:41,627
'for such a long time...

428
00:33:41,710 --> 00:33:43,962
"and I feel desperate
and helpless...

429
00:33:44,046 --> 00:33:47,049
"and I am burning my brains
with worry.

430
00:33:47,132 --> 00:33:49,259
'Yesterday I wrote you
such a long letter...

431
00:33:49,343 --> 00:33:51,053
"that said everything
perfectly...

432
00:33:51,136 --> 00:33:52,638
-"and believe it--"
-Listen.

433
00:33:58,684 --> 00:34:00,019
Mandras!

434
00:34:16,201 --> 00:34:18,161
 I can't stay here.

435
00:34:37,178 --> 00:34:40,223
Signorina. Signorina.

436
00:34:40,306 --> 00:34:42,350
You are drunk.

437
00:34:42,434 --> 00:34:44,019
Yes, I confess.

438
00:34:44,102 --> 00:34:46,354
We have been
drinking, singing...

439
00:34:46,438 --> 00:34:48,648
generally misbehaving.

440
00:34:48,732 --> 00:34:51,316
I thought you were a soldier.

441
00:34:51,400 --> 00:34:53,610
Captain Antonio Corelli,
33rd Regiment, Artillery...

442
00:34:53,736 --> 00:34:55,279
reporting for duty!

443
00:34:56,989 --> 00:34:58,907
Is everything a joke to you?

444
00:35:00,701 --> 00:35:03,620
No. Not everything.

445
00:35:13,129 --> 00:35:16,090
Captain Corelli,
I think this would be...

446
00:35:16,174 --> 00:35:18,884
a good time to hear you
play the mandolin.

447
00:35:35,358 --> 00:35:37,818
What on earth are you doing?

448
00:35:40,363 --> 00:35:43,032
I was just about to start.

449
00:35:43,115 --> 00:35:44,700
Well, about time, too,
I should think.

450
00:35:44,784 --> 00:35:48,578
The first 45 1/2 bars
are for the orchestra.

451
00:35:48,661 --> 00:35:51,164
"Allegro moderato e grazioso."

452
00:35:51,247 --> 00:35:53,625
You have to imagine
the orchestra.

453
00:35:53,708 --> 00:35:56,336
I'm damned if I can sit through
all that tapping again.

454
00:35:56,419 --> 00:35:58,088
Just play your part.

455
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,130
 If I do that,
I'll start getting confused...

456
00:36:00,214 --> 00:36:01,673
about when I'm
supposed to come in...

457
00:36:01,757 --> 00:36:05,469
and that, in a concert hall,
would be a disaster.

458
00:36:05,552 --> 00:36:08,597
I apologise
for disrupting the concert.

459
00:36:08,681 --> 00:36:11,684
I apologise to each
and every one of you.

460
00:36:11,767 --> 00:36:14,811
To those in the cheapest seats
in the gods...

461
00:36:14,936 --> 00:36:17,230
to Your Majesties
in your royal boxes...

462
00:36:17,313 --> 00:36:22,026
draped in your jewellery
and your fine furs.

463
00:36:22,110 --> 00:36:24,987
But I'm damned
if I can imagine an orchestra.

464
00:36:26,531 --> 00:36:28,240
I am going to bed.

465
00:37:35,386 --> 00:37:38,305
 Is this where
the captain sleeps?

466
00:37:40,891 --> 00:37:43,185
I was coming to see you.

467
00:37:45,103 --> 00:37:46,688
I'm leaving, Pelagia.

468
00:37:48,440 --> 00:37:49,566
In the morning.

469
00:37:49,691 --> 00:37:51,692
I'll take my boat to Astakos.

470
00:37:51,776 --> 00:37:54,445
-It's not safe.
-I'm a fisherman.

471
00:37:54,528 --> 00:37:57,156
I know those waters
like the back of my hand.

472
00:37:57,239 --> 00:37:59,492
I don't want you to go.

473
00:37:59,575 --> 00:38:04,830
If I die,
I won't have died for nothing.

474
00:38:04,914 --> 00:38:08,291
And if I live, I'll walk
with my head held high...

475
00:38:08,375 --> 00:38:11,211
for the rest of my life,
and everyone will say...

476
00:38:11,294 --> 00:38:15,590
"That's Mandras, who fought
for his country in the war."

477
00:38:18,051 --> 00:38:21,762
I finished your waistcoat.

478
00:38:21,887 --> 00:38:23,472
Ah.

479
00:38:23,555 --> 00:38:25,683
You can take it now if you want.

480
00:38:26,892 --> 00:38:28,102
Heh heh.

481
00:38:30,020 --> 00:38:32,106
The two sides...

482
00:38:32,189 --> 00:38:33,606
they are not the same.

483
00:38:36,818 --> 00:38:39,028
The Italian captain.

484
00:38:39,112 --> 00:38:41,823
...Albania.

485
00:38:41,906 --> 00:38:44,867
14,000 of you
against 8,000 of us.

486
00:38:44,951 --> 00:38:46,494
You could have driven us
into the sea.

487
00:38:46,577 --> 00:38:49,037
If it weren't for your
German friends, we would have.

488
00:38:49,162 --> 00:38:52,165
My friends are the men
in my battery.

489
00:38:52,249 --> 00:38:55,127
People I grew up with.
People of my home town.

490
00:38:55,210 --> 00:38:57,879
So, what do you think
of our island, Captain?

491
00:38:58,005 --> 00:38:59,798
I like your island.

492
00:38:59,881 --> 00:39:01,966
And what do you think
of our girls?

493
00:39:02,049 --> 00:39:04,301
Hmm?

494
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:07,680
What do you think of my Pelagia?

495
00:39:47,216 --> 00:39:49,510
Good-bye, Pelagia.

496
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:54,891
My beautiful Pelagia.

497
00:40:24,043 --> 00:40:27,796
A bell'opre e pietose

498
00:40:27,879 --> 00:40:32,384
A carezzar fanciulli

499
00:40:32,467 --> 00:40:34,469
A coglier rose

500
00:40:34,552 --> 00:40:37,597
A pregar, giunte

501
00:40:37,681 --> 00:40:40,933
Per le sventure

502
00:40:41,016 --> 00:40:42,726
Dunque in voi

503
00:40:42,810 --> 00:40:46,271
Fatte dall'amore secure

504
00:40:46,355 --> 00:40:51,735
Giustizia le sue sacre
armi depose?

505
00:40:51,819 --> 00:40:54,946
Depose

506
00:40:55,029 --> 00:41:00,284
O dolci mani

507
00:41:00,368 --> 00:41:02,870
Mansuete e pure

508
00:41:02,996 --> 00:41:05,456
O mani elette

509
00:41:05,540 --> 00:41:08,291
A bell'opre...

510
00:41:12,004 --> 00:41:13,171
Heil Hitler.

511
00:41:13,255 --> 00:41:14,423
Heil Puccini.

512
00:41:16,633 --> 00:41:17,884
I saw your party.

513
00:41:17,926 --> 00:41:19,636
I thought I would come
and introduce myself.

514
00:41:19,636 --> 00:41:21,013
You mean,
you saw the naked women...

515
00:41:21,095 --> 00:41:23,180
and want to come
and get a closer look.

516
00:41:25,349 --> 00:41:26,684
We've met before.

517
00:41:26,767 --> 00:41:29,061
The surrender at the town hall.

518
00:41:29,145 --> 00:41:31,313
You are much better
at having parties...

519
00:41:31,397 --> 00:41:33,274
than you are
at negotiating surrender.

520
00:41:33,357 --> 00:41:34,900
Well, we're Italian.

521
00:41:34,984 --> 00:41:39,404
Famous for singing,
eating, making love.

522
00:41:39,487 --> 00:41:40,739
What's your name?

523
00:41:40,822 --> 00:41:43,408
Antonio Corelli. Grazie.

524
00:41:47,912 --> 00:41:50,331
Mmm. Mmm.

525
00:41:50,414 --> 00:41:53,000
You Germans always have
the best tobacco, huh?

526
00:41:53,083 --> 00:41:54,752
How many of you are here now?

527
00:41:54,835 --> 00:41:57,421
Approximately 1,200.
Under Colonel Barge.

528
00:41:57,504 --> 00:41:58,714
Here to keep an eye on us.

529
00:41:58,797 --> 00:42:03,009
Doesn't it feel good
to have your allies here?

530
00:42:03,092 --> 00:42:05,595
I thought all you Nazis
had blond hair.

531
00:42:05,678 --> 00:42:06,846
I come from the Tyrol.

532
00:42:06,929 --> 00:42:09,140
Grew up
in the Austrian mountains.

533
00:42:09,223 --> 00:42:10,767
All my family,
and my family before them...

534
00:42:10,850 --> 00:42:13,811
going back as far as we
can remember, have dark hair.

535
00:42:13,895 --> 00:42:15,730
Like Adolf Hilter?

536
00:42:17,814 --> 00:42:20,359
You neglected
to tell me your rank.

537
00:42:20,442 --> 00:42:21,610
I am the breve.

538
00:42:21,693 --> 00:42:24,571
Maximilliano here
is the semibreve.

539
00:42:24,655 --> 00:42:25,906
He is the minim.

540
00:42:26,031 --> 00:42:27,991
Those boys are the crotchets
and the quavers.

541
00:42:28,075 --> 00:42:29,910
Piero here is the semiquaver.

542
00:42:29,993 --> 00:42:32,578
And Carlo is the rest.

543
00:42:32,662 --> 00:42:35,831
The pause between the notes.

544
00:42:35,915 --> 00:42:38,042
In the opera club, we have
our own ranking system...

545
00:42:38,125 --> 00:42:40,086
but otherwise I am a captain.

546
00:42:40,169 --> 00:42:42,463
33rd Regiment of Artillery.

547
00:42:42,546 --> 00:42:46,508
-Do you sing?
-Oh, no, uh, not really.

548
00:42:46,591 --> 00:42:49,094
Well, maybe, you know.

549
00:42:49,177 --> 00:42:51,721
On my own. In the bath.

550
00:42:51,805 --> 00:42:54,099
Well, have a drink. Be happy.

551
00:42:54,182 --> 00:42:55,392
But just remember...

552
00:42:55,475 --> 00:42:57,602
if you ever express
admiration for Wagner...

553
00:42:57,686 --> 00:43:00,437
you will be shot,
without trial...

554
00:43:00,521 --> 00:43:01,980
and without leave of appeal.

555
00:43:03,273 --> 00:43:05,025
From the top!

556
00:43:38,765 --> 00:43:41,517
-Lemoni...

557
00:43:41,600 --> 00:43:43,436
Come on.

558
00:43:47,481 --> 00:43:49,108
La donna è mobile

559
00:43:49,191 --> 00:43:50,943
Qual piuma al vento

560
00:43:51,027 --> 00:43:54,280
Muta d'accento

561
00:44:25,641 --> 00:44:27,852
 Buonasera, signorina

562
00:44:33,066 --> 00:44:35,318
Are you going to shoot me?

563
00:44:52,500 --> 00:44:53,751
 It wasn't loaded.

564
00:45:02,093 --> 00:45:06,137
I've never aimed a gun
at anybody.

565
00:45:06,221 --> 00:45:07,806
Never in my life.

566
00:45:11,101 --> 00:45:12,560
It must be very difficult...

567
00:45:12,644 --> 00:45:15,313
for you to have
to put up with us.

568
00:45:15,397 --> 00:45:16,564
It must be very difficult...

569
00:45:16,648 --> 00:45:19,566
for you to have
to live with yourself.

570
00:45:19,650 --> 00:45:23,195
You lie in the sun
and swim in the sea...

571
00:45:23,278 --> 00:45:26,323
and flirt with your prostitutes.

572
00:45:26,407 --> 00:45:30,369
And there are people I know,
people I grew up with...

573
00:45:30,452 --> 00:45:32,246
who are fighting
for their lives...

574
00:45:32,329 --> 00:45:34,956
and dying for what
they believe in.

575
00:45:35,039 --> 00:45:36,708
And all you do is sing.

576
00:45:40,712 --> 00:45:42,338
What's there to sing about?

577
00:45:42,422 --> 00:45:47,551
We are in the middle of a war,
not an opera house.

578
00:45:47,634 --> 00:45:49,636
And you, you think
you are so cultured...

579
00:45:49,720 --> 00:45:51,722
with your pasta
and your panettone...

580
00:45:51,805 --> 00:45:53,348
and your puffed-up opera.

581
00:45:56,310 --> 00:45:59,313
Why don't you take your holiday
on somebody else's island?

582
00:46:04,025 --> 00:46:05,860
What is there to sing about?

583
00:46:07,778 --> 00:46:10,698
There is singing
when babies are baptised...

584
00:46:10,740 --> 00:46:15,493
when you celebrate a marriage.

585
00:46:15,577 --> 00:46:17,579
Men sing as they work.

586
00:46:17,662 --> 00:46:22,083
Soldiers sing
as they march into battle...

587
00:46:22,167 --> 00:46:27,297
and there is singing
when people die.

588
00:46:27,339 --> 00:46:30,174
I have always found something
in life worth singing about...

589
00:46:31,759 --> 00:46:35,054
and for that
I cannot apologise.

590
00:46:39,725 --> 00:46:42,102
For the fact that
I've caused you pain...

591
00:46:42,186 --> 00:46:45,438
I cannot apologise enough.

592
00:46:45,521 --> 00:46:50,735
I have not been able
to imagine, until now...

593
00:46:50,777 --> 00:46:53,321
the offence I have given.

594
00:47:29,396 --> 00:47:31,481
-What are those?
-My things.

595
00:47:31,564 --> 00:47:34,526
 I can see that. Why?

596
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:37,654
 I'm going to stay
in the encampment with my men.

597
00:47:37,737 --> 00:47:39,196
I think it will be best.

598
00:47:39,279 --> 00:47:40,531
But you must understand...

599
00:47:40,614 --> 00:47:42,950
I made an arrangement
with your quartermaster.

600
00:47:43,033 --> 00:47:44,743
We agreed the terms.

601
00:47:44,827 --> 00:47:47,287
I would not feel comfortable...

602
00:47:47,371 --> 00:47:49,456
Letting him down.

603
00:47:49,540 --> 00:47:53,626
Therefore,
I think you should stay.

604
00:47:53,710 --> 00:47:57,547
 I don't think
your daughter would agree.

605
00:47:57,630 --> 00:47:59,799
My daughter
understands the importance...

606
00:47:59,882 --> 00:48:01,175
of honouring an arrangement.

607
00:48:01,259 --> 00:48:03,136
I'll speak to the quartermaster.

608
00:48:03,219 --> 00:48:06,347
Make sure you continue
to get your medical supplies.

609
00:48:06,430 --> 00:48:09,599
I've enjoyed meeting you.

610
00:48:09,683 --> 00:48:11,560
I'm only sorry
about the circumstances.

611
00:48:33,581 --> 00:48:37,042
Giovenezza, giovenezza

612
00:48:37,125 --> 00:48:40,920
Primavera di bellezza

613
00:48:41,046 --> 00:48:44,674
Giovenezza, giovenezza

614
00:48:44,758 --> 00:48:48,719
Primavera di bellezza

615
00:48:59,229 --> 00:49:00,856
"Citizens of Cephallonia.

616
00:49:00,939 --> 00:49:03,524
"In these unfortunate
and difficult times...

617
00:49:03,608 --> 00:49:05,276
"Let us show the world...

618
00:49:05,360 --> 00:49:07,987
"how two ancient cultures
can coexist...

619
00:49:08,071 --> 00:49:11,741
"and behave in a civilised
manner towards one another.

620
00:49:11,824 --> 00:49:14,952
"Please join us
in an evening of relaxation...

621
00:49:15,036 --> 00:49:18,956
"as we extend the hand
of friendship to you all."

622
00:50:14,215 --> 00:50:15,633
I'll be back in a moment.

623
00:50:28,770 --> 00:50:30,897
My friend thinks
you are very pretty.

624
00:50:30,981 --> 00:50:33,775
Why doesn't he tell me himself?

625
00:50:33,859 --> 00:50:35,527
He's too shy.

626
00:50:37,154 --> 00:50:40,281
He wants to know
if you'll dance with him.

627
00:50:40,364 --> 00:50:43,367
No, I can't--
not with a German.

628
00:50:44,577 --> 00:50:46,829
But tell him thank you.

629
00:50:46,912 --> 00:50:49,707
Tell him I don't mean
to be rude.

630
00:50:54,336 --> 00:50:55,962
Uno momento.

631
00:52:10,782 --> 00:52:12,117
Don't stay up too late.

632
00:53:37,821 --> 00:53:39,990
Antonio!

633
00:53:46,871 --> 00:53:49,207
It's Turkish.

634
00:53:49,290 --> 00:53:51,668
From the Great War.

635
00:53:51,751 --> 00:53:53,419
We should explode it.

636
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:55,546
The explosive must have decayed.

637
00:53:55,630 --> 00:53:58,632
It's been floating
for about twenty years.

638
00:53:58,715 --> 00:54:00,509
We could have put on
a good show.

639
00:54:18,317 --> 00:54:21,445
 We are going
to explode the bomb.

640
00:54:21,529 --> 00:54:23,905
It will be
a fantastic explosion...

641
00:54:23,989 --> 00:54:26,199
and when the time comes...

642
00:54:26,283 --> 00:54:29,577
nobody must come down
to the beach.

643
00:54:29,661 --> 00:54:32,622
You must watch
from where you are.

644
00:55:34,721 --> 00:55:36,556
Capitano!

645
00:56:03,206 --> 00:56:07,710
You must be one of the most
stupid people I've ever met.

646
00:56:07,794 --> 00:56:11,047
You wanted to show off so
you nearly get us all killed.

647
00:56:11,130 --> 00:56:12,423
I can see your lips moving...

648
00:56:12,507 --> 00:56:14,050
but I can't hear
a word you're saying.

649
00:56:14,133 --> 00:56:16,510
It should pass--
in a day or two.

650
00:56:16,593 --> 00:56:19,137
Your father says
it will pass in a day or two.

651
00:56:19,221 --> 00:56:20,889
Does he?

652
00:56:21,014 --> 00:56:23,475
Is that what
the great doctor says?

653
00:56:23,558 --> 00:56:25,769
What are you saying?

654
00:56:25,852 --> 00:56:28,522
Are you saying
how beautiful life is...

655
00:56:28,605 --> 00:56:30,314
since the Italians arrived?

656
00:56:30,398 --> 00:56:32,358
All my life I've been waiting.

657
00:56:32,441 --> 00:56:35,069
I don't know
how I survived before you came.

658
00:56:35,152 --> 00:56:39,282
Are you saying how much
you missed having me around?

659
00:56:39,365 --> 00:56:41,659
I miss you so much
I can't sleep at night.

660
00:56:41,742 --> 00:56:43,202
The other night
when you were dancing...

661
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:45,203
the way you were moving...

662
00:56:46,871 --> 00:56:49,624
The turn of your head.

663
00:56:50,959 --> 00:56:52,961
I thought
I could watch you forever.

664
00:56:55,046 --> 00:56:57,631
You think you can come here...

665
00:56:57,715 --> 00:57:01,510
and turn my whole world
upside-down?

666
00:57:04,179 --> 00:57:04,471
 Iodine.

667
00:57:06,599 --> 00:57:08,058
Bandages.

668
00:57:08,142 --> 00:57:10,394
Dressings.
This is all I have.

669
00:57:10,477 --> 00:57:11,728
I can't give you any morphine.

670
00:57:11,853 --> 00:57:14,314
And we need
all the quinine we have.

671
00:57:14,397 --> 00:57:15,648
12,000 of our men
on the mainland...

672
00:57:15,773 --> 00:57:17,108
are sick with malaria.

673
00:57:17,191 --> 00:57:19,152
Supplies
are not getting through.

674
00:57:19,235 --> 00:57:21,529
Nobody knows why, nobody
knows what is happening...

675
00:57:21,654 --> 00:57:23,615
and I'm going to eat.

676
00:57:27,367 --> 00:57:31,371
You know,
when I met Pelagia's mother...

677
00:57:31,455 --> 00:57:35,500
she was betrothed
to somebody else.

678
00:57:35,584 --> 00:57:38,086
He nearly killed me.

679
00:57:38,211 --> 00:57:40,463
I had to leave the island.

680
00:57:40,546 --> 00:57:42,548
I had to lie low for a while.

681
00:57:45,843 --> 00:57:49,722
She wants to train
to be a doctor, you know.

682
00:57:49,805 --> 00:57:53,683
You think
she'd make a good doctor?

683
00:57:53,808 --> 00:57:56,227
I think she'd make
a very good doctor.

684
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:02,025
 Oh, uh...

685
00:58:04,861 --> 00:58:07,322
Another thing.

686
00:58:07,446 --> 00:58:11,200
This is a very ancient land...

687
00:58:11,283 --> 00:58:13,494
and we have had nothing
but earthquakes...

688
00:58:13,577 --> 00:58:16,038
and slaughter for 2,000 years.

689
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:18,707
We've had massacres
at Sami and Fiskardo...

690
00:58:18,791 --> 00:58:21,417
and God knows where else.

691
00:58:21,501 --> 00:58:25,004
There will be more.

692
00:58:25,129 --> 00:58:28,883
It's only a question of time.

693
00:58:28,967 --> 00:58:31,386
So don't make any plans.

694
00:58:35,348 --> 00:58:38,684
Sul mare luccia

695
00:58:38,767 --> 00:58:42,145
L'astro d'argento

696
00:58:42,229 --> 00:58:45,732
 Placida e' I'onda

697
00:58:45,816 --> 00:58:49,236
Prospero e' il vento

698
00:58:49,319 --> 00:58:53,406
Venite all'agile

699
00:58:53,489 --> 00:58:56,867
Barchetta mia

700
00:58:56,951 --> 00:59:00,079
Santa Lucia

701
00:59:00,162 --> 00:59:03,707
Santa Lucia

702
00:59:03,790 --> 00:59:07,919
Venite all'agile

703
00:59:08,003 --> 00:59:11,047
Barchetta mia

704
00:59:11,131 --> 00:59:14,467
Santa Lucia

705
00:59:14,551 --> 00:59:21,265
Santa

706
00:59:21,348 --> 00:59:24,476
Lucia

707
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:25,686
 Bravo!

708
00:59:38,740 --> 00:59:42,035
After the war,
I'll leave it with you.

709
00:59:45,287 --> 00:59:47,414
You're very sweet.

710
00:59:53,462 --> 00:59:56,548
The Allies have landed
in ltaly.

711
00:59:56,632 --> 00:59:57,925
We can all go home then.

712
00:59:59,425 --> 01:00:01,135
I can't believe it.

713
01:00:01,218 --> 01:00:03,220
You really want this war
to be over?

714
01:00:03,304 --> 01:00:05,222
What is wrong
with you Italians?

715
01:00:05,306 --> 01:00:07,433
We don't have your advantages,
Gunther.

716
01:00:07,558 --> 01:00:09,936
-Advantages?

717
01:00:10,019 --> 01:00:11,520
 The advantage
of thinking that...

718
01:00:11,604 --> 01:00:13,605
other races
are inferior to yours.

719
01:00:13,688 --> 01:00:15,023
It's a question of science.

720
01:00:15,106 --> 01:00:16,775
You can't alter
a scientific fact.

721
01:00:16,858 --> 01:00:18,443
I don't care about science.

722
01:00:18,526 --> 01:00:20,403
It's morality that counts.

723
01:00:20,487 --> 01:00:21,738
What is your morality?

724
01:00:21,821 --> 01:00:22,989
If I were to see a man...

725
01:00:23,073 --> 01:00:24,532
being set upon by others...

726
01:00:24,616 --> 01:00:26,618
I would think
that man was my brother.

727
01:00:26,701 --> 01:00:28,118
That is my morality.

728
01:00:28,202 --> 01:00:30,663
I would make myself
believe it's personal.

729
01:00:30,746 --> 01:00:32,957
For me, too,
the war is personal.

730
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:35,125
I lost both my grandfathers
in the Great War.

731
01:00:35,209 --> 01:00:36,794
 A war that you started.

732
01:00:36,877 --> 01:00:38,003
And my father's brother...

733
01:00:38,087 --> 01:00:39,672
two of my mother's brothers.

734
01:00:39,797 --> 01:00:43,049
I grew up in a country
where it was hard to survive.

735
01:00:43,091 --> 01:00:45,176
We were hungry all the time.

736
01:00:45,218 --> 01:00:47,720
All we ever knew about
was defeat. But now--

737
01:00:47,804 --> 01:00:49,222
Sometimes it is better...

738
01:00:49,305 --> 01:00:53,226
to lose than to have
so much blood on your hands.

739
01:00:53,309 --> 01:00:54,477
It's a beautiful night...

740
01:00:54,560 --> 01:00:56,478
and everything is peaceful...

741
01:00:56,561 --> 01:00:59,982
and we should think
about falling in love.

742
01:02:49,500 --> 01:02:51,543
That's beautiful.

743
01:02:51,627 --> 01:02:52,962
What is it?

744
01:02:54,255 --> 01:02:56,131
It's "Pelagia's Song."

745
01:03:51,558 --> 01:03:54,019
I wrote you that song
because I love you.

746
01:03:56,187 --> 01:03:58,689
I don't care
if the world knows it.

747
01:04:00,900 --> 01:04:02,067
I couldn't care less...

748
01:04:02,151 --> 01:04:04,778
if I never pick up
the mandolin again.

749
01:04:04,862 --> 01:04:09,199
When I was playing, it felt like
my hands were lumps of wood.

750
01:04:10,492 --> 01:04:15,288
It felt as if every note
was sour, stale.

751
01:04:17,832 --> 01:04:20,710
And then I realised--

752
01:04:20,793 --> 01:04:23,463
it's useless.

753
01:04:23,546 --> 01:04:25,380
It's hopeless.

754
01:04:26,840 --> 01:04:30,677
It can't begin to express
the way I feel about you.

755
01:05:53,504 --> 01:05:55,089
Next time you see him...

756
01:05:55,172 --> 01:05:57,425
tell him I have got
his mandolin.

757
01:06:00,136 --> 01:06:02,263
He left it in the square.

758
01:06:32,457 --> 01:06:36,878
Four more boys from the village
have left to join Mandras.

759
01:06:38,755 --> 01:06:41,341
Constantine's boys.

760
01:06:41,424 --> 01:06:43,593
Kostas's brother,
what's his name?

761
01:06:43,676 --> 01:06:45,219
George.

762
01:06:45,302 --> 01:06:48,931
He's only fifteen.

763
01:06:49,014 --> 01:06:51,016
He always worshipped Mandras.

764
01:06:52,517 --> 01:06:53,810
Do you love him?

765
01:06:54,978 --> 01:06:56,813
We are engaged to be married.

766
01:06:58,315 --> 01:07:00,274
I am not talking about Mandras.

767
01:07:12,661 --> 01:07:14,496
When you fall in love...

768
01:07:14,579 --> 01:07:18,750
it is a temporary madness.

769
01:07:18,833 --> 01:07:23,672
It erupts like an earthquake,
and then it subsides.

770
01:07:23,755 --> 01:07:27,508
And when it subsides,
you have to make a decision.

771
01:07:27,591 --> 01:07:30,678
You have to work out
whether your roots...

772
01:07:30,761 --> 01:07:32,263
have become
so entwined together...

773
01:07:32,346 --> 01:07:34,056
that it is inconceivable...

774
01:07:34,139 --> 01:07:36,100
that you should ever part.

775
01:07:37,685 --> 01:07:41,771
Because this is what love is.

776
01:07:45,984 --> 01:07:49,362
Love is not breathlessness.
It is not excitement.

777
01:07:49,445 --> 01:07:52,282
It's not the desire to mate
every second of the day.

778
01:07:52,365 --> 01:07:53,825
It is not lying awake
at night...

779
01:07:53,908 --> 01:07:57,286
imagining that he is kissing
every part of your body.

780
01:08:01,081 --> 01:08:04,543
No, don't blush.

781
01:08:08,005 --> 01:08:10,047
I'm telling you some truths.

782
01:08:12,508 --> 01:08:14,760
That is just being in love...

783
01:08:14,844 --> 01:08:19,599
which any of us
can convince ourselves we are.

784
01:08:19,682 --> 01:08:23,351
Love itself
is what is left over...

785
01:08:23,435 --> 01:08:26,396
when being in love
has burned away.

786
01:08:28,356 --> 01:08:30,984
Doesn't sound very exciting,
does it?

787
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:36,031
But it is.

788
01:08:39,408 --> 01:08:42,912
Do you think that you
could begin to imagine...

789
01:08:42,995 --> 01:08:46,123
that that is how you will come
to feel with Captain Corelli?

790
01:08:54,839 --> 01:08:56,090
Pelagia...

791
01:08:57,967 --> 01:09:00,470
You must act honourably...

792
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,890
with respect
to Mandras and his mother.

793
01:09:07,809 --> 01:09:09,228
And...

794
01:09:11,063 --> 01:09:14,733
pray for the liberation
of the island...

795
01:09:14,816 --> 01:09:19,111
because then everything
becomes possible.

796
01:10:13,413 --> 01:10:14,788
Drosoula.

797
01:10:17,040 --> 01:10:19,293
All night I've been thinking
about Mandras.

798
01:10:21,253 --> 01:10:22,754
About me and Mandras.

799
01:10:24,756 --> 01:10:27,426
Thinking about how long
we've been apart.

800
01:10:40,479 --> 01:10:42,731
When did you arrive?

801
01:10:42,814 --> 01:10:44,190
Where is your ring?

802
01:10:46,192 --> 01:10:47,986
My fingers got too thin.

803
01:10:50,530 --> 01:10:52,073
I thought I would lose it.

804
01:10:56,535 --> 01:10:57,786
Where will you stay?

805
01:10:57,870 --> 01:10:59,371
I want to ask you something.

806
01:11:01,665 --> 01:11:03,834
We need to see
the Italian captain.

807
01:11:05,294 --> 01:11:08,464
I want you to ask him
to meet with us.

808
01:11:08,547 --> 01:11:10,924
As soon as you can.

809
01:11:11,007 --> 01:11:12,842
 In Germany,
the port of Hamburg...

810
01:11:12,926 --> 01:11:15,386
suffered a second day
of continuous air raids...

811
01:11:15,470 --> 01:11:17,764
from nearly
800 British aircraft...

812
01:11:17,847 --> 01:11:20,016
Leaving much of the city
in ruin.

813
01:11:20,099 --> 01:11:22,602
While, in ltaly,
Rome has finally fallen...

814
01:11:22,685 --> 01:11:25,520
to the Allied advance after
weeks of fierce fighting...

815
01:11:25,604 --> 01:11:28,232
and a huge bombing campaign
on the capital.

816
01:11:28,315 --> 01:11:29,900
Allied commandos...

817
01:11:29,983 --> 01:11:32,194
are closely watching
the Mediterranean countries...

818
01:11:32,277 --> 01:11:34,446
occupied by German
and Italian forces.

819
01:11:34,530 --> 01:11:37,491
It's not yet clear
what the German attitude...

820
01:11:37,574 --> 01:11:39,450
to an Italian withdrawal
might be...

821
01:11:39,534 --> 01:11:41,452
but Germany
will assume sole command...

822
01:11:41,536 --> 01:11:43,746
of many strategic territories.

823
01:11:43,829 --> 01:11:47,208
Hitler is expected to send
massive reinforcements...

824
01:11:47,291 --> 01:11:49,460
through the Balkans
and into Greece...

825
01:11:49,544 --> 01:11:52,004
as the Nazis struggle
to maintain supply routes...

826
01:11:52,087 --> 01:11:53,296
to northern Africa.

827
01:11:54,339 --> 01:11:55,715
Mandras is back.

828
01:11:55,799 --> 01:11:57,592
He wants to see you.

829
01:11:59,719 --> 01:12:01,638
La donna è mobile

830
01:12:01,721 --> 01:12:03,640
Qual piuma al vento

831
01:12:03,723 --> 01:12:07,434
Muta d'accento

832
01:12:07,518 --> 01:12:09,144
E di pensiero

833
01:12:09,228 --> 01:12:11,021
It's over! It's all over!

834
01:12:11,105 --> 01:12:12,940
-Mussolini has fallen!
-Finito!

835
01:12:13,023 --> 01:12:14,191
We're going home!

836
01:12:14,275 --> 01:12:15,526
Finito!

837
01:13:20,211 --> 01:13:23,422
Colonel Barge and I have agreed
the date for the surrender...

838
01:13:23,505 --> 01:13:25,799
of our heavy weapons
and machine guns--

839
01:13:25,883 --> 01:13:28,135
the fifteenth of September.

840
01:13:28,219 --> 01:13:30,011
That's in five days time.

841
01:13:31,804 --> 01:13:34,390
 Why should we
lay down our arms?

842
01:13:34,474 --> 01:13:36,392
They were our allies.

843
01:13:36,476 --> 01:13:39,354
Why should they be
dictating terms to us?

844
01:13:39,437 --> 01:13:41,022
We have surrendered.

845
01:13:41,105 --> 01:13:44,399
Mussolini has surrendered to
the British and the Americans...

846
01:13:44,483 --> 01:13:45,901
not to the Germans.

847
01:13:46,026 --> 01:13:48,904
 Colonel Barge
and I have agreed.

848
01:13:48,987 --> 01:13:53,492
If we surrender our arms,
do we have confirmation...

849
01:13:53,575 --> 01:13:55,953
that they will not
use force against us?

850
01:13:56,036 --> 01:13:57,371
 I have
a personal undertaking...

851
01:13:57,454 --> 01:13:58,746
from Colonel Barge
and his officers...

852
01:13:58,829 --> 01:14:00,831
that our troops
will be allowed safe passage.

853
01:14:00,915 --> 01:14:02,708
 My men will
never agree to return home...

854
01:14:02,792 --> 01:14:04,377
without their weapons.

855
01:14:04,460 --> 01:14:07,088
If you surrender your arms
in times of war...

856
01:14:07,171 --> 01:14:08,673
then you are no longer a man.

857
01:14:08,756 --> 01:14:10,091
 If you were
in their position...

858
01:14:10,174 --> 01:14:11,551
if you were German...

859
01:14:11,634 --> 01:14:14,511
you would want to be certain
for your own security...

860
01:14:14,594 --> 01:14:16,388
that the weapons
will not be passed on...

861
01:14:16,471 --> 01:14:19,641
to the Allied forces
or to the Greek partisans.

862
01:14:19,724 --> 01:14:21,059
Or turned against you.

863
01:14:23,520 --> 01:14:25,564
Or turned against you.

864
01:14:56,925 --> 01:14:59,928
You must be looking forward
to going home.

865
01:15:00,012 --> 01:15:03,682
There'll be people happy
to see you again, I'm sure.

866
01:15:03,765 --> 01:15:07,060
Your family, your mother,
your wife.

867
01:15:07,144 --> 01:15:08,394
Your girlfriend?

868
01:15:09,937 --> 01:15:11,689
 You wanted to see me?

869
01:15:11,772 --> 01:15:13,232
 We need arms.

870
01:15:13,316 --> 01:15:15,985
Machine guns,
ammunition, land mines...

871
01:15:16,068 --> 01:15:17,612
anything you can spare.

872
01:15:17,695 --> 01:15:19,488
How can I give you weapons?

873
01:15:19,572 --> 01:15:22,032
-You know I can't do that.
-You've surrendered.

874
01:15:22,115 --> 01:15:23,325
If you don't intend to fight...

875
01:15:23,408 --> 01:15:24,534
you won't be needing
your weapons.

876
01:15:24,659 --> 01:15:26,119
We have a country to defend.

877
01:15:26,203 --> 01:15:27,495
There is a massive build up...

878
01:15:27,579 --> 01:15:29,456
of German troops
on the mainland.

879
01:15:29,581 --> 01:15:32,792
The 117th Jaeger Division
is nearing the Corinth Canal.

880
01:15:32,876 --> 01:15:35,712
The 104th is moving south
from Yugoslavia.

881
01:15:35,794 --> 01:15:38,047
Then you are not
in any position to resist.

882
01:15:38,130 --> 01:15:39,381
Unless we act now.

883
01:15:39,465 --> 01:15:42,635
Do you know, Captain,
on Lefkada island...

884
01:15:42,718 --> 01:15:44,220
all the Italians
who surrendered...

885
01:15:44,303 --> 01:15:47,181
have been sent
to prison camps in the north.

886
01:15:51,392 --> 01:15:53,102
We heard they went home.

887
01:15:53,186 --> 01:15:55,688
The trains were diverted
in Albania.

888
01:15:55,772 --> 01:15:57,899
In this war, Captain...

889
01:15:57,982 --> 01:16:00,360
it's hard to know
who you can trust.

890
01:16:00,443 --> 01:16:03,571
But one thing is certain--

891
01:16:03,655 --> 01:16:05,447
you can't trust the Germans.

892
01:16:38,395 --> 01:16:40,105
Last night I dreamed
I was sitting...

893
01:16:40,188 --> 01:16:43,567
in a restaurant
in Piazza Navona...

894
01:16:43,650 --> 01:16:47,236
eating
zuppe di cozze piccante...

895
01:16:47,319 --> 01:16:50,239
then a plate
of tagliarini al boscaiolo.

896
01:16:57,121 --> 01:16:58,330
Colonel Barge has requested...

897
01:16:58,455 --> 01:17:01,416
I withdraw your battery
from Antisamos Beach.

898
01:17:04,335 --> 01:17:07,380
If they wanted to bring in
heavy reinforcements...

899
01:17:07,463 --> 01:17:10,633
this is where they would do it.

900
01:17:10,717 --> 01:17:12,385
Is this an order?

901
01:17:12,468 --> 01:17:14,052
Captain...

902
01:17:14,094 --> 01:17:16,054
don't you want to go home?

903
01:18:17,737 --> 01:18:19,030
Are you going to let us through?

904
01:18:19,113 --> 01:18:20,490
My orders are to supervise...

905
01:18:20,573 --> 01:18:22,700
the surrender
of your arms and weapons.

906
01:18:31,291 --> 01:18:34,461
The deadline for the hand-over
is at noon tomorrow.

907
01:18:34,545 --> 01:18:36,213
 Antonio.

908
01:18:38,798 --> 01:18:41,717
This order comes
from Colonel Barge.

909
01:18:41,801 --> 01:18:43,094
He has asked me personally...

910
01:18:43,177 --> 01:18:45,471
to assure you that
if you surrender your arms...

911
01:18:45,555 --> 01:18:48,766
you will be guaranteed
safe passage.

912
01:18:48,850 --> 01:18:52,018
Like the Italian garrison
at Lefkada?

913
01:18:53,395 --> 01:18:55,605
Lefkada?

914
01:18:55,689 --> 01:18:57,941
But they laid down
their weapons.

915
01:18:58,024 --> 01:18:59,276
They went home.

916
01:19:39,021 --> 01:19:42,065
You must be looking forward
to seeing ltaly again.

917
01:19:45,360 --> 01:19:46,695
Do you think
we could keep in touch?

918
01:19:49,030 --> 01:19:51,282
I mean, after the war,
of course.

919
01:20:05,086 --> 01:20:08,256
You can have my gun when
I've finished my cigarette.

920
01:20:12,969 --> 01:20:14,763
Get your hands off me, you ba--

921
01:20:32,445 --> 01:20:33,947
I understand your concern.

922
01:20:34,030 --> 01:20:36,491
If I were in your shoes, I would
be asking questions, too.

923
01:20:36,574 --> 01:20:38,493
Of course, we will
investigate what happened--

924
01:20:38,576 --> 01:20:40,954
I can tell you
what happened--

925
01:20:41,079 --> 01:20:42,205
My men are dead!

926
01:20:42,288 --> 01:20:43,914
...take the appropriate action.

927
01:20:43,997 --> 01:20:46,708
 What does that mean?

928
01:20:46,792 --> 01:20:50,420
Does it mean that I can write
to the families of these men...

929
01:20:50,504 --> 01:20:52,840
and tell them that their
murderers will be charged...

930
01:20:52,923 --> 01:20:54,466
that justice will prevail?

931
01:20:54,550 --> 01:20:57,760
You force us at gunpoint to
line up and surrender our arms.

932
01:20:57,844 --> 01:20:59,846
You impound our weapons.

933
01:20:59,929 --> 01:21:01,222
We're supposed to be allies!

934
01:21:01,305 --> 01:21:02,807
Captain Corelli, please!

935
01:21:04,350 --> 01:21:06,853
We need some kind of assurance.

936
01:21:09,647 --> 01:21:12,274
I can assure you
that the order to disarm...

937
01:21:12,357 --> 01:21:14,693
did not come
from my headquarters.

938
01:21:17,571 --> 01:21:19,948
 We have agreed to
the surrender of our arms...

939
01:21:20,073 --> 01:21:21,575
by noon tomorrow.

940
01:21:21,658 --> 01:21:24,578
We would like your assurance
that no more of our troops...

941
01:21:24,661 --> 01:21:28,581
will be forcibly disarmed
before that deadline.

942
01:21:28,664 --> 01:21:31,792
 Herr General,
by noon tomorrow...

943
01:21:31,876 --> 01:21:35,254
I guarantee
you'll be on your way home.

944
01:21:52,729 --> 01:21:55,564
This is not our war.

945
01:21:55,647 --> 01:21:57,774
This is between
the Greeks and the Germans.

946
01:21:57,858 --> 01:22:00,319
 Would you prefer we
left them to fight on their own?

947
01:22:02,279 --> 01:22:04,740
 The 4th Regiment
will hold Antisamos.

948
01:22:04,823 --> 01:22:07,034
We'll keep the 5th
in reserve at Assos...

949
01:22:07,116 --> 01:22:09,619
and I will take
the 8th and 9th to Argostoli.

950
01:22:14,123 --> 01:22:15,791
 All gun lines
to be in position...

951
01:22:15,875 --> 01:22:17,793
by first light tomorrow.

952
01:23:04,795 --> 01:23:06,463
If we resist now,
we can beat them.

953
01:23:06,547 --> 01:23:08,423
What if the Germans send planes?

954
01:23:08,549 --> 01:23:11,510
Don't go near Argostoli.
Stay away from Antisamos Beach.

955
01:23:11,552 --> 01:23:14,054
I want to lie across the road
so that you can't leave.

956
01:23:14,137 --> 01:23:17,098
Keep a gun with you
at all times. Promise me.

957
01:23:19,433 --> 01:23:21,185
Come back to me.

958
01:23:21,269 --> 01:23:22,645
Promise me.

959
01:23:25,940 --> 01:23:29,527
When it's over,
you will come back to me.

960
01:23:56,218 --> 01:23:58,179
 I know what you feel.

961
01:24:00,221 --> 01:24:03,183
You think if he died
your world will stop.

962
01:24:05,143 --> 01:24:07,103
I will look out for him.

963
01:25:29,263 --> 01:25:30,472
Pelagia!

964
01:25:49,782 --> 01:25:50,949
 Mama! Mama!

965
01:25:51,032 --> 01:25:52,659
 Pelagia!

966
01:25:54,244 --> 01:25:56,454
Stay here! It's not safe!

967
01:25:59,082 --> 01:26:00,584
Pelagia!

968
01:26:16,932 --> 01:26:18,100
Drosoula!

969
01:26:19,142 --> 01:26:20,977
 Drosoula!

970
01:26:21,060 --> 01:26:24,272
-Drosoula! Drosoula!
-What are you doing?

971
01:26:24,355 --> 01:26:27,650
-She's a traitor and a whore.
-Mandras.

972
01:26:27,775 --> 01:26:30,445
 Help me! Help me!

973
01:26:31,362 --> 01:26:32,489
Mandras.

974
01:26:32,614 --> 01:26:34,448
 Help me!

975
01:27:20,366 --> 01:27:22,284
The enemy's
a hundred metres away.

976
01:27:22,368 --> 01:27:23,953
There's heavy armour coming.

977
01:28:14,416 --> 01:28:15,625
Aah!

978
01:28:19,254 --> 01:28:20,547
Aah!

979
01:28:34,101 --> 01:28:35,686
Aaah!

980
01:31:42,317 --> 01:31:43,568
 Gunther.

981
01:31:57,998 --> 01:31:59,166
Gunther.

982
01:31:59,250 --> 01:32:00,584
Come on, move!

983
01:34:19,004 --> 01:34:20,923
 Shoot me.

984
01:36:15,363 --> 01:36:17,365
He's alive.

985
01:36:22,035 --> 01:36:23,245
 He's alive.

986
01:36:24,663 --> 01:36:26,623
He was alive when I found him.

987
01:36:35,965 --> 01:36:38,467
Fragments of uniform
in the bullet holes.

988
01:36:38,551 --> 01:36:41,011
-Splinters of rib.
-Just do it.

989
01:36:41,137 --> 01:36:42,763
I am not a surgeon.
I have no penicillin.

990
01:36:42,847 --> 01:36:43,973
Please!

991
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:45,891
I have no sterile water.
No serum.

992
01:36:46,016 --> 01:36:47,351
Please, Father, do it!

993
01:37:02,739 --> 01:37:04,658
Hold.

994
01:37:21,507 --> 01:37:23,968
Four of his ribs are broken.

995
01:37:48,407 --> 01:37:51,660
Papa! Antonio. Don't move.

996
01:37:51,744 --> 01:37:53,412
Don't move!

997
01:37:53,496 --> 01:37:56,165
If you even try to move,
you will haemorrhage to death.

998
01:37:56,248 --> 01:37:57,707
Uhh!

999
01:37:57,791 --> 01:37:59,417
No, you must lie still.

1000
01:37:59,501 --> 01:38:04,506
How--I don't--I don't...

1001
01:38:04,589 --> 01:38:08,093
You were lying
under Carlo's body.

1002
01:38:08,176 --> 01:38:12,596
If it wasn't for him,
you wouldn't be alive.

1003
01:38:16,850 --> 01:38:18,811
How did I get here?

1004
01:38:22,523 --> 01:38:24,191
Mandras found you.

1005
01:38:38,079 --> 01:38:43,792
 Antonio, you
should try and drink something.

1006
01:38:43,875 --> 01:38:45,252
Antonio?

1007
01:39:14,195 --> 01:39:17,240
What would you like for lunch?

1008
01:39:17,365 --> 01:39:19,784
Not that there
is any choice, of course.

1009
01:39:19,868 --> 01:39:21,744
But if there was...

1010
01:39:27,499 --> 01:39:35,174
We needed something--
steel, wire--to bind the bones.

1011
01:39:35,299 --> 01:39:40,762
Of course, they'll have to be
removed sometime in the future.

1012
01:39:40,845 --> 01:39:44,932
I could try and get some
new strings from somewhere.

1013
01:39:45,016 --> 01:39:47,101
I could ask around.

1014
01:40:40,234 --> 01:40:41,402
Antonio!

1015
01:40:42,903 --> 01:40:44,571
What are you doing?

1016
01:40:44,655 --> 01:40:46,322
 If they find me,
they will shoot you both.

1017
01:40:46,406 --> 01:40:48,282
They'll kill you
if you leave this house.

1018
01:40:48,366 --> 01:40:51,786
I don't belong here, Pelagia!
I never belonged here!

1019
01:40:51,869 --> 01:40:56,332
Ever since I came, look what
has happened all around you.

1020
01:40:56,416 --> 01:40:58,084
I love you.

1021
01:40:58,167 --> 01:40:59,501
I had no right
to make you love me...

1022
01:40:59,584 --> 01:41:01,545
when you weren't mine to love.

1023
01:41:03,171 --> 01:41:04,965
 No! Don't do that!

1024
01:41:12,222 --> 01:41:15,433
-Lemoni.

1025
01:41:15,516 --> 01:41:17,893
 Lemoni!

1026
01:41:17,977 --> 01:41:19,311
Go to Doctor Iannis's house.

1027
01:41:19,395 --> 01:41:20,521
Go now. Go!

1028
01:41:21,939 --> 01:41:23,149
Go now!

1029
01:41:24,275 --> 01:41:25,443
Mama will be back!

1030
01:42:42,597 --> 01:42:46,559
Dimitris will row you
to a boat out in the bay.

1031
01:42:50,480 --> 01:42:52,940
 You should be home
by tomorrow night.

1032
01:43:27,556 --> 01:43:29,224
We must go.

1033
01:43:42,903 --> 01:43:47,449
I had to see you again.
One last time.

1034
01:43:47,532 --> 01:43:49,159
We must go!

1035
01:43:51,578 --> 01:43:53,246
Pelagia--

1036
01:43:53,329 --> 01:43:55,790
Don't say anything.

1037
01:44:01,962 --> 01:44:03,255
Look at me.

1038
01:44:03,338 --> 01:44:04,548
 We must go!

1039
01:44:04,631 --> 01:44:06,550
-Go.
-Pelagia.

1040
01:44:06,633 --> 01:44:08,802
Go! Go.

1041
01:44:50,925 --> 01:44:54,303
Why did you save him?

1042
01:44:54,387 --> 01:44:56,764
Why didn't you
leave him to die?

1043
01:44:58,973 --> 01:45:01,434
I wanted you
to love me again.

1044
01:45:08,108 --> 01:45:14,738
In Albania, I made them read
every one of these to me.

1045
01:45:14,863 --> 01:45:18,158
"Mandras, I love you.
Mandras, I want you.

1046
01:45:18,242 --> 01:45:21,370
"Mandras, when are you
coming back?"

1047
01:45:25,665 --> 01:45:27,875
And then one day
a different letter.

1048
01:45:33,047 --> 01:45:36,384
"I don't know how
to describe my feelings.

1049
01:45:36,467 --> 01:45:38,511
"It's as if I've been
waiting a hundred years...

1050
01:45:38,594 --> 01:45:40,262
"to hear from you.

1051
01:45:40,345 --> 01:45:42,931
"Waiting a hundred years
for you to return.

1052
01:45:43,014 --> 01:45:46,435
"Once I thought
my heart was overflowing...

1053
01:45:46,518 --> 01:45:49,479
"with love for you.

1054
01:45:49,563 --> 01:45:52,607
"But now all I feel
is emptiness.

1055
01:45:52,691 --> 01:45:57,945
"And I think all the time
it was a pretence...

1056
01:45:58,028 --> 01:46:00,114
"that I never loved you at all."

1057
01:46:21,383 --> 01:46:22,843
I'm sorry.

1058
01:46:28,849 --> 01:46:30,642
I'm sorry.

1059
01:46:48,117 --> 01:46:53,747
 The war we thought
would never end is over.

1060
01:46:53,830 --> 01:46:59,544
And the island we thought we
had lost forever is ours again.

1061
01:47:06,801 --> 01:47:11,639
In the doctor's house
there are three of us now...

1062
01:47:11,722 --> 01:47:16,227
the doctor, his daughter...

1063
01:47:16,310 --> 01:47:18,520
who is training
to be a doctor...

1064
01:47:18,603 --> 01:47:20,188
and Lemoni.

1065
01:47:20,271 --> 01:47:22,482
Pelagia! Pelagia!

1066
01:47:24,984 --> 01:47:26,736
It's for you.

1067
01:47:27,987 --> 01:47:29,489
From ltaly.

1068
01:47:51,467 --> 01:47:53,594
 What is it?

1069
01:47:57,890 --> 01:47:59,808
It's a record.

1070
01:48:41,930 --> 01:48:46,226
We should start making supper,
that's what we should do.

1071
01:48:46,310 --> 01:48:47,519
Lemoni.

1072
01:48:56,152 --> 01:48:59,655
Antonio, I do not know...

1073
01:48:59,739 --> 01:49:01,908
if this letter
will reach you...

1074
01:49:01,991 --> 01:49:05,495
or even if you are alive.

1075
01:49:05,578 --> 01:49:08,789
Perhaps someone else
sent us your record...

1076
01:49:08,872 --> 01:49:11,500
and that is why
we found no note.

1077
01:49:13,835 --> 01:49:16,755
I would like to say
that Pelagia is happy...

1078
01:49:16,797 --> 01:49:21,093
but she is full of tears
she will not let fall...

1079
01:49:21,176 --> 01:49:26,055
and of a grief
no doctor can mend.

1080
01:49:26,138 --> 01:49:30,309
She blames herself for
the pain we have suffered...

1081
01:49:30,393 --> 01:49:33,479
and perhaps the same
is true for you.

1082
01:49:35,064 --> 01:49:38,817
You know I am not
a religious man...

1083
01:49:38,900 --> 01:49:41,736
but I believe this...

1084
01:49:41,820 --> 01:49:45,907
if there is a wound,
we must try to heal it...

1085
01:49:45,990 --> 01:49:50,120
if there is someone
whose pain we can cure...

1086
01:49:50,203 --> 01:49:53,414
we must search
till we find them...

1087
01:49:53,497 --> 01:49:57,501
if the gods have chosen
that we should survive...

1088
01:49:57,584 --> 01:49:59,545
it will be for a reason.

1089
01:52:55,666 --> 01:52:57,710
Where is your miracle
today then, eh?

1090
01:52:57,793 --> 01:53:00,129
What do we have
to say about that?

1091
01:53:38,873 --> 01:53:40,917
 Wake up.
Fetch the firewood.

1092
01:53:41,000 --> 01:53:43,378
Fix the roof.
Paint the house.

1093
01:53:43,461 --> 01:53:46,339
She's driving me mad.

1094
01:53:46,422 --> 01:53:49,925
When I was deaf,
I couldn't hear her...nagging.

1095
01:53:50,008 --> 01:53:52,177
But now--

1096
01:53:52,260 --> 01:53:56,390
Iatre, I beg of you, help me.

1097
01:53:56,473 --> 01:53:59,226
Put the pea back in my ear.

1098
01:53:59,309 --> 01:54:01,186
Iatre?

1099
01:54:08,234 --> 01:54:10,820
Lemoni?

1100
01:54:10,903 --> 01:54:13,406
Lemoni?

1101
01:54:13,489 --> 01:54:15,074
Lemoni?

1102
01:54:42,641 --> 01:54:44,767
I was looking for Lemoni.

1103
01:54:44,851 --> 01:54:47,854
She's down the road.

1104
01:54:47,937 --> 01:54:51,733
I went to the house.

1105
01:54:51,816 --> 01:54:55,236
It doesn't exist anymore.

1106
01:54:55,319 --> 01:54:57,780
We are building a new one.

1107
01:54:59,573 --> 01:55:01,700
Your father wrote
you got the record.

1108
01:55:03,869 --> 01:55:07,748
It's a guitar.
It's different.

1109
01:55:17,048 --> 01:55:19,550
I tried to live without you.

1110
01:55:19,633 --> 01:55:24,805
I tried to make myself believe
I could live without you.

1111
01:55:41,487 --> 01:55:43,238
The scar healed well.

1112
01:55:59,671 --> 01:56:04,634
Stamatis, do you love your wife?

1113
01:56:04,717 --> 01:56:09,805
If you love your wife,
my advice is be nice to her.

1114
01:56:09,888 --> 01:56:13,308
Bring in the wood
before she asks you for it.

1115
01:56:13,392 --> 01:56:18,730
If she is cold, then put
a shawl around her shoulders.

1116
01:56:18,814 --> 01:56:20,607
And bring her a flower...

1117
01:56:20,691 --> 01:56:23,150
every time you come back
from the field.

1118
01:56:23,234 --> 01:56:26,529
 You won't put the pea
back in my ear?

1119
01:56:26,612 --> 01:56:28,656
 Oh, no, no, no.

1120
01:56:28,781 --> 01:56:31,867
That would be against
the Hippocratic Oath.
