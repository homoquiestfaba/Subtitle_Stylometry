1
00:03:13,177 --> 00:03:16,639
To everything
there is a season.

2
00:03:16,639 --> 00:03:19,475
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

3
00:03:19,475 --> 00:03:23,228
Time to love,
and a time to hate.

4
00:03:23,228 --> 00:03:26,856
A time to keep silence,
and a time to speak.

5
00:03:31,235 --> 00:03:33,029
A time to cast away stones,

6
00:03:33,029 --> 00:03:36,282
and a time
to gather stones together.

7
00:03:36,282 --> 00:03:39,243
A time to kill,
and a time to heal.

8
00:03:40,619 --> 00:03:44,122
A time to break down,
and a time to build up.

9
00:03:44,122 --> 00:03:48,668
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.

10
00:03:48,668 --> 00:03:50,503
A time to mourn.

11
00:04:04,182 --> 00:04:07,769
(Screaming off screen)

12
00:04:43,500 --> 00:04:45,582
I know.

13
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:47,997
I know, girl,
that's what I'm talking about.

14
00:04:47,997 --> 00:04:49,704
I mean, he would have
straightened up his act by now,

15
00:04:49,704 --> 00:04:51,078
and he just didn't.

16
00:04:51,078 --> 00:04:55,575
I just don't have time
for these games, Charmaine.

17
00:04:55,575 --> 00:04:57,449
No.

18
00:04:57,449 --> 00:05:00,322
No, I'm fine.

19
00:05:00,322 --> 00:05:02,113
I'm fine.

20
00:05:10,357 --> 00:05:13,939
I mean, once he sees what's
really out there, he'll know.

21
00:05:15,978 --> 00:05:18,894
No, I think I'm just gonna go
back home.

22
00:05:18,894 --> 00:05:20,434
I think I might take
the semester off

23
00:05:20,434 --> 00:05:21,642
and hang around the house.

24
00:05:21,642 --> 00:05:23,516
(Police siren)

25
00:05:23,516 --> 00:05:25,014
Oh, shit.

26
00:05:25,014 --> 00:05:26,222
Shit, I gotta go, Charmaine.

27
00:05:26,222 --> 00:05:27,805
I think I'm getting pulled over.

28
00:05:30,605 --> 00:05:32,394
Oh, man!

29
00:05:48,623 --> 00:05:50,411
Damn it!

30
00:05:54,073 --> 00:05:55,239
God.

31
00:06:08,638 --> 00:06:10,511
Oh, God.

32
00:06:14,698 --> 00:06:16,153
What did I do?

33
00:06:16,153 --> 00:06:17,567
Well, ma'am,

34
00:06:17,609 --> 00:06:21,145
it looks like you can't seem
to drive in a straight line.

35
00:06:21,145 --> 00:06:23,556
Listen, I was just getting
a little tired.

36
00:06:23,556 --> 00:06:24,597
It won't happen again.

37
00:06:24,597 --> 00:06:25,886
Promise.

38
00:06:25,886 --> 00:06:28,298
Well, pumpkin,
I don't think that promise

39
00:06:28,298 --> 00:06:30,545
is gonna keep the rest of the
motorists on this road safe.

40
00:06:34,608 --> 00:06:38,970
I think they'll be okay.

41
00:06:38,970 --> 00:06:40,631
(Laughing)

42
00:06:40,631 --> 00:06:42,958
Look, I only have 100 more miles
to my mom's house in Ascension.

43
00:06:42,958 --> 00:06:44,370
Can you just please let me go?

44
00:06:44,370 --> 00:06:46,198
Yeah, well...

45
00:06:49,564 --> 00:06:51,891
Now what do we got here?

46
00:06:51,891 --> 00:06:53,304
Looks like you started the party
a little early, huh?

47
00:06:53,304 --> 00:06:54,965
(Laughing)

48
00:06:54,965 --> 00:06:57,042
I was just trying to stay awake.

49
00:06:57,042 --> 00:06:58,830
Sorry.

50
00:06:58,830 --> 00:07:02,320
I'm gonna have to ask you
to step out of the car, ma'am.

51
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:03,524
I'm really sorry.

52
00:07:03,524 --> 00:07:04,730
I mean, it won't happen--

53
00:07:04,730 --> 00:07:06,641
Step out of the goddamn car!

54
00:07:06,641 --> 00:07:07,595
Please,
I've just never been--

55
00:07:07,595 --> 00:07:08,552
Get out of this goddamn car.

56
00:07:08,552 --> 00:07:09,466
(Screaming)

57
00:07:09,466 --> 00:07:10,505
Get and turn around,
and hug that!

58
00:07:10,505 --> 00:07:11,584
Spread your legs!

59
00:07:11,584 --> 00:07:13,704
Spread it and shut up!

60
00:07:13,704 --> 00:07:15,573
(Crying)

61
00:07:18,564 --> 00:07:20,351
Turn around.

62
00:07:20,351 --> 00:07:22,428
I said turn around!

63
00:07:27,040 --> 00:07:28,286
(Laughing)

64
00:07:28,286 --> 00:07:30,904
You know,
I got a daughter your age,

65
00:07:30,904 --> 00:07:34,851
and I'd hate like hell
to see you spend the night

66
00:07:34,851 --> 00:07:36,513
in a dirty, stinking
holding cell,

67
00:07:36,513 --> 00:07:38,964
'cause I know you wouldn't
want to have to squat

68
00:07:38,964 --> 00:07:40,543
that pretty little ass of yours

69
00:07:40,543 --> 00:07:41,541
on some dirty toilet seat.

70
00:07:41,541 --> 00:07:42,745
No.

71
00:07:45,113 --> 00:07:48,521
What are you saying?

72
00:07:48,521 --> 00:07:51,387
I can't let you back on my road.

73
00:07:51,387 --> 00:07:53,921
I'm gonna have
to take your car keys.

74
00:07:53,921 --> 00:07:56,207
What am I supposed to do?

75
00:08:01,954 --> 00:08:03,075
Easy.

76
00:08:05,818 --> 00:08:07,311
Well, I tell you what.

77
00:08:07,311 --> 00:08:11,050
I could just give you a ride
down the road to a motel.

78
00:08:11,050 --> 00:08:15,245
You could spend the night
on me.

79
00:08:15,245 --> 00:08:17,985
I'll pay.

80
00:08:17,985 --> 00:08:19,937
And then in the morning when
you're all sobered up,

81
00:08:19,937 --> 00:08:23,011
I'll give you your keys back,
and you can just be on your way.

82
00:08:23,011 --> 00:08:25,296
But I need to get home.

83
00:08:25,296 --> 00:08:26,832
I just need to get home.

84
00:08:29,932 --> 00:08:32,174
Is your mama expecting you?

85
00:08:34,869 --> 00:08:37,154
No, she was already asleep.

86
00:08:39,852 --> 00:08:42,632
Well, now you got two choices.

87
00:08:42,632 --> 00:08:44,292
Go to the motel or go to jail.

88
00:08:49,935 --> 00:08:52,425
I'll take the motel.

89
00:08:52,425 --> 00:08:55,995
That's right.

90
00:08:55,995 --> 00:08:58,484
Right this way, señorita.

91
00:09:01,484 --> 00:09:03,806
Come on.

92
00:09:19,815 --> 00:09:22,011
Carter, glad to see
you could make it.

93
00:09:22,011 --> 00:09:24,664
I've only been waiting an hour.

94
00:09:24,664 --> 00:09:27,194
Yeah, well, time's getting
scarce nowadays.

95
00:09:27,194 --> 00:09:30,554
I guess it is,
all that money you making.

96
00:09:30,554 --> 00:09:34,286
You keep your goddamn eyes
off my pockets, Freddie.

97
00:09:37,478 --> 00:09:39,179
Are we gonna do some business,

98
00:09:39,179 --> 00:09:41,957
or just stand here and shoot
the breeze all fucking day?

99
00:09:41,957 --> 00:09:44,943
Got some new clients for you.

100
00:09:44,943 --> 00:09:46,478
Some real high-rollers.

101
00:09:51,048 --> 00:09:53,661
I need names and addresses
and social security numbers,

102
00:09:53,661 --> 00:09:54,613
and all that kind of thing.

103
00:09:54,613 --> 00:09:57,431
Carter.

104
00:09:57,431 --> 00:09:59,254
I got a truckload of Mexicans.

105
00:09:59,254 --> 00:10:00,748
Snagged them when
they were trying

106
00:10:00,748 --> 00:10:02,863
to make it across the border
in a U-Haul.

107
00:10:02,863 --> 00:10:05,182
You snagged them yourself, huh?

108
00:10:05,182 --> 00:10:08,457
Yeah.

109
00:10:08,457 --> 00:10:10,986
15 of them amigos.

110
00:10:10,986 --> 00:10:14,839
Got them in a safe house
down in Waco.

111
00:10:16,705 --> 00:10:20,310
I figured that you can put on
a pretty show

112
00:10:20,310 --> 00:10:21,883
with those Speedy Gonzales
mother-fuckers.

113
00:10:21,883 --> 00:10:22,878
You know,
running for their life.

114
00:10:27,156 --> 00:10:29,266
How much?

115
00:10:33,573 --> 00:10:37,840
$500 a piece,
for the whole motherlode.

116
00:10:37,840 --> 00:10:39,331
Even got a couple of teenagers.

117
00:10:42,646 --> 00:10:44,633
(Crashing)

118
00:10:44,633 --> 00:10:45,628
What the hell's the matter
with you?

119
00:10:46,994 --> 00:10:49,728
No kids!

120
00:10:49,728 --> 00:10:53,248
Goddamn it, you hear me?

121
00:10:53,248 --> 00:10:55,648
Ugh!

122
00:10:59,418 --> 00:11:00,826
I'll give you $250.

123
00:11:00,826 --> 00:11:04,389
You let them damn kids go.

124
00:11:04,389 --> 00:11:06,957
I want everybody else here
in less than 12 hours.

125
00:11:06,957 --> 00:11:09,110
You can stop at Sonic
on the way back.

126
00:11:09,110 --> 00:11:10,569
Get me a cherry limeade.

127
00:11:32,830 --> 00:11:34,690
God, my eyes
are like 1,000 pounds.

128
00:11:34,690 --> 00:11:37,672
I told you you wouldn't be able
to get any work done in the car.

129
00:11:37,672 --> 00:11:39,408
Why don't you just shut the
computer and put it away?

130
00:11:39,408 --> 00:11:43,423
Way to support
your wife there, Don.

131
00:11:43,423 --> 00:11:45,119
God, I told you
I had a deadline.

132
00:11:45,119 --> 00:11:46,485
Can you just give
a damn once, please?

133
00:11:47,932 --> 00:11:49,132
It's not that I don't give
a damn, Nancy.

134
00:11:49,132 --> 00:11:51,697
It's that we're on vacation.

135
00:11:51,697 --> 00:11:53,433
And when you're on vacation,
you don't work.

136
00:11:53,433 --> 00:11:55,833
That's, uh, why they call it
a vacation.

137
00:11:55,833 --> 00:11:59,309
You know, it never ceases
to amaze me

138
00:11:59,309 --> 00:12:01,087
that you always deem it
necessary

139
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:05,346
to tell people what to do.

140
00:12:05,346 --> 00:12:07,624
May I remind you that making
a stupid website 10 years ago

141
00:12:07,624 --> 00:12:10,310
does not make you the dictator
of everyone.

142
00:12:16,102 --> 00:12:17,715
Why don't we pull over
at the next place?

143
00:12:17,715 --> 00:12:19,121
Grab some coffee and a couple
of those beignets you like?

144
00:12:21,152 --> 00:12:23,177
I hate those beignets.

145
00:12:23,177 --> 00:12:24,417
I do not want to pull over.

146
00:12:24,417 --> 00:12:25,741
I just want to get there,
please.

147
00:12:25,741 --> 00:12:27,311
We're always rushing
everywhere, Nancy.

148
00:12:27,311 --> 00:12:29,502
Let's just mosey around
a bit

149
00:12:29,502 --> 00:12:32,853
and take in some
of the local flavor.

150
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,630
Mosey?

151
00:12:42,981 --> 00:12:45,750
Stupid website, huh?

152
00:12:45,750 --> 00:12:47,360
Well, next time you want to add

153
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:49,180
to that shoe collection
of yours,

154
00:12:49,180 --> 00:12:50,957
or flash the American Express
Platinum card

155
00:12:50,957 --> 00:12:52,157
around the way you like to,

156
00:12:52,199 --> 00:12:53,480
we'll see how stupid you think
the website is.

157
00:12:53,480 --> 00:12:55,792
May I remind you
that I have been there

158
00:12:55,792 --> 00:12:57,735
from the very beginning?

159
00:12:57,735 --> 00:12:59,141
Who, who stayed up all night
doing research for you?

160
00:12:59,141 --> 00:13:01,203
Who watched every dime for you?

161
00:13:01,203 --> 00:13:03,189
Who told you to sell
those tech stocks

162
00:13:03,189 --> 00:13:04,842
before they took a nose dive?

163
00:13:04,842 --> 00:13:06,497
I have been cleaning
your shit-stained underwear

164
00:13:06,497 --> 00:13:07,569
for years, Don!

165
00:13:09,569 --> 00:13:11,634
I deserve every pair of shoes
in my collection,

166
00:13:11,634 --> 00:13:13,990
so don't make me feel bad
about it.

167
00:13:13,990 --> 00:13:15,476
If anything,
you should be supporting me

168
00:13:15,476 --> 00:13:18,368
in my career, you idiot!

169
00:13:18,368 --> 00:13:21,050
Just try not to act normal,
Nancy!

170
00:13:21,050 --> 00:13:23,076
Fucking arrogant bastard.

171
00:13:23,076 --> 00:13:24,315
Supposed to be a vacation.

172
00:13:38,771 --> 00:13:41,702
I'm--

173
00:13:41,702 --> 00:13:44,430
I'm sorry that I called
your website stupid.

174
00:13:49,183 --> 00:13:52,523
Whatever.

175
00:13:52,523 --> 00:13:53,720
Don't worry about it.

176
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:57,062
Hey, hey!

177
00:14:02,053 --> 00:14:04,445
When did you stop listening?

178
00:14:04,445 --> 00:14:06,218
Okay, when did we stop listening
to each other?

179
00:14:10,299 --> 00:14:12,694
You haven't listened to a word
I've said in years.

180
00:14:12,694 --> 00:14:13,685
Stop.

181
00:14:13,685 --> 00:14:16,116
You know what?

182
00:14:16,116 --> 00:14:17,727
Fuck you.

183
00:14:17,727 --> 00:14:20,655
Fuck you.

184
00:14:20,655 --> 00:14:22,139
Yeah.

185
00:14:22,139 --> 00:14:23,212
Exactly.

186
00:14:23,212 --> 00:14:24,902
I thought we were talking about
listening, anyway.

187
00:14:24,902 --> 00:14:28,781
Listen to this, fuck you.

188
00:14:28,781 --> 00:14:30,099
Fuck you!

189
00:14:30,099 --> 00:14:31,089
No, fuck you.

190
00:14:31,089 --> 00:14:33,362
Fuck you.

191
00:14:33,362 --> 00:14:34,265
Stop it! Stop it!

192
00:14:34,265 --> 00:14:36,370
What are you, nuts?

193
00:14:36,370 --> 00:14:39,050
Get a hold of yourself.

194
00:14:39,050 --> 00:14:42,637
Jesus Christ.

195
00:15:01,739 --> 00:15:03,512
Hey!

196
00:15:38,855 --> 00:15:39,965
Yes, we're in the middle
of fucking nowhere!

197
00:15:39,965 --> 00:15:41,077
Can you just--

198
00:15:41,077 --> 00:15:42,273
Can you just send somebody,
please?

199
00:15:42,273 --> 00:15:44,623
Trace the call!

200
00:16:22,320 --> 00:16:24,173
Unbelievable,
it's been over an hour.

201
00:16:24,173 --> 00:16:26,888
Yeah, well, they probably had
to finish milking the cows

202
00:16:26,888 --> 00:16:29,316
before they headed out.

203
00:16:29,316 --> 00:16:31,290
Always on time
with the jokes there, Don.

204
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:33,102
Well, you know,

205
00:16:33,102 --> 00:16:34,995
there's nothing like playing
to a friendly audience.

206
00:16:38,452 --> 00:16:39,601
I wish they'd get here soon.

207
00:16:39,601 --> 00:16:41,869
I would hate to see what would
come out of those woods.

208
00:17:31,208 --> 00:17:32,686
Thank you very much
for coming.

209
00:17:32,686 --> 00:17:34,164
We got hit.

210
00:17:34,164 --> 00:17:36,835
Some guy hit us twice
and drove off.

211
00:17:41,973 --> 00:17:43,987
Can you start her up?

212
00:17:43,987 --> 00:17:45,176
Well, it wouldn't start
earlier.

213
00:17:45,176 --> 00:17:47,271
But look,
I'll try it again.

214
00:17:55,527 --> 00:17:59,347
(Engine stalling)

215
00:18:01,647 --> 00:18:03,951
Pretty good-looking gal
you got there.

216
00:18:06,454 --> 00:18:08,385
Thanks.

217
00:18:08,385 --> 00:18:10,724
Y'all going on a road trip?

218
00:18:10,724 --> 00:18:13,188
Hey, did you call
a tow truck?

219
00:18:13,188 --> 00:18:14,995
Where you all going?

220
00:18:14,995 --> 00:18:16,185
The casino in Marksville.

221
00:18:17,460 --> 00:18:20,412
Hell, that's 100 miles back down
the road from where you came.

222
00:18:20,412 --> 00:18:21,275
No, it's not.

223
00:18:21,275 --> 00:18:22,714
Oh, yes, it is.

224
00:18:26,240 --> 00:18:28,660
Oh, come on.

225
00:18:28,660 --> 00:18:30,013
You told me
you'd been there before.

226
00:18:30,013 --> 00:18:31,776
GPS says it's this way.

227
00:18:34,686 --> 00:18:36,985
This ain't none of my business,
but pretty gal like that?

228
00:18:36,985 --> 00:18:39,606
You ought to be taking her to
a nicer place than Marksville.

229
00:18:42,313 --> 00:18:43,219
No disrespect.

230
00:18:43,219 --> 00:18:45,392
None taken.

231
00:18:45,392 --> 00:18:47,319
Can't afford to have pride on
a night like this, right?

232
00:18:47,319 --> 00:18:48,219
That's right.

233
00:18:48,219 --> 00:18:50,641
So, did you call
a tow truck?

234
00:18:50,641 --> 00:18:54,580
Oh, hell, you ain't gonna get
a tow truck

235
00:18:54,580 --> 00:18:56,422
this time of night
within a hundred miles.

236
00:18:56,422 --> 00:18:59,870
You'll have to wait until about
8 a.m. in the morning.

237
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:01,304
8 a.m.?

238
00:19:01,304 --> 00:19:02,618
8 a.m.

239
00:19:02,618 --> 00:19:04,258
You're sure?

240
00:19:04,258 --> 00:19:07,622
I'm sure.

241
00:19:07,622 --> 00:19:11,026
Well, hell,
I'll tell you what.

242
00:19:11,026 --> 00:19:13,076
If you'd like, I can give you
and the pretty lady here

243
00:19:13,076 --> 00:19:15,373
a ride down to a little motel
about 15 minutes down the road.

244
00:19:17,502 --> 00:19:19,470
Get yourself a room,
get a good night's sleep

245
00:19:19,470 --> 00:19:20,658
and I'll make sure
you get a tow truck

246
00:19:20,698 --> 00:19:21,721
first thing in the morning.

247
00:19:21,721 --> 00:19:24,674
What about
a rental car company?

248
00:19:25,864 --> 00:19:29,469
Come on now, do I look like
I work for Enterprise?

249
00:19:29,469 --> 00:19:32,461
Hell, this time of night, I
should be sleeping in my car

250
00:19:32,461 --> 00:19:33,610
somewhere on the side
of the road.

251
00:19:33,610 --> 00:19:36,642
Now, if you wanna get your gear
and come with me,

252
00:19:36,642 --> 00:19:39,797
I'll take you down to that motel
if you'd like.

253
00:19:39,797 --> 00:19:43,241
Well, make up your mind, 'cause
I'm leaving in two minutes.

254
00:19:45,464 --> 00:19:47,471
Gotta protect and serve!

255
00:19:49,316 --> 00:19:51,692
We just need a minute
to gather our stuff.

256
00:19:57,342 --> 00:19:59,063
We're lucky he came.

257
00:19:59,063 --> 00:20:01,561
This is ridiculous,
absolutely--

258
00:20:01,561 --> 00:20:02,623
No, no, no!

259
00:20:02,623 --> 00:20:04,672
Do not take that thing.

260
00:20:04,672 --> 00:20:06,760
I hate that thing,
put it back.

261
00:20:06,760 --> 00:20:09,056
Put it down.

262
00:20:09,056 --> 00:20:11,717
You'll probably get arrested
or something.

263
00:20:45,318 --> 00:20:48,426
¶ Tell my mother
that I love her ¶

264
00:20:48,426 --> 00:20:50,675
¶ Tell my lover
there ain't no other ¶

265
00:20:50,675 --> 00:20:54,315
¶ Tell my brother I'll see him
down the road sometime ¶

266
00:20:54,315 --> 00:20:55,788
¶ Oh my ¶

267
00:20:55,788 --> 00:20:56,769
¶ My my my my ¶

268
00:20:56,769 --> 00:20:58,160
¶ My my my ¶

269
00:20:58,160 --> 00:21:00,530
Whoo!

270
00:21:00,530 --> 00:21:02,332
All right,
here we go folks.

271
00:21:03,885 --> 00:21:08,264
Welcome to the finest digs
in Parish.

272
00:21:08,264 --> 00:21:09,202
Oh, come on!

273
00:21:09,202 --> 00:21:10,062
Are you serious?

274
00:21:10,062 --> 00:21:13,785
Hey, it's not so bad.

275
00:21:13,785 --> 00:21:15,053
I'm sure you got yourself
one of those platinum cards

276
00:21:15,053 --> 00:21:18,078
you can just swipe,
swipe, swipe.

277
00:21:18,078 --> 00:21:19,346
Unbelievable

278
00:21:21,274 --> 00:21:23,992
I would rather stay in that car
than sleep in this shit hole.

279
00:21:23,992 --> 00:21:25,951
Well, you're gonna have yourself
a long walk,

280
00:21:25,951 --> 00:21:27,310
'cause as of now,
my shift is officially over.

281
00:21:31,307 --> 00:21:33,266
Who you calling now?

282
00:21:33,266 --> 00:21:35,865
911, this is a fucking
emergency!

283
00:21:37,264 --> 00:21:39,143
You're wasting your time, ma'am.

284
00:21:39,143 --> 00:21:41,142
As I said, I am the law,

285
00:21:41,142 --> 00:21:42,461
and I'm the only law in town.

286
00:21:42,461 --> 00:21:43,980
Great, now I don't even have
a signal.

287
00:21:43,980 --> 00:21:45,179
Don, give me your phone.

288
00:21:45,179 --> 00:21:48,777
Look, if you don't have a
signal, I'm not gonna have one.

289
00:21:51,689 --> 00:21:53,327
Great, this is just great.

290
00:21:53,327 --> 00:21:55,606
I'm stuck in the middle
of nowhere

291
00:21:55,606 --> 00:21:56,604
and I'm gonna catch crabs
tonight.

292
00:21:56,604 --> 00:21:59,323
Hey, this here's a fine
establishment.

293
00:21:59,323 --> 00:22:03,119
Matter of fact--

294
00:22:03,119 --> 00:22:05,956
I had my wedding
reception here.

295
00:22:05,956 --> 00:22:09,073
Now if you don't mind,
I've got business to tend to.

296
00:22:09,073 --> 00:22:11,431
On the side of the road,
right?

297
00:22:11,431 --> 00:22:13,709
Little something for my time?

298
00:22:13,709 --> 00:22:18,025
Go fuck yourself.

299
00:22:18,025 --> 00:22:19,943
Here.

300
00:22:19,943 --> 00:22:21,701
Unbelievable.

301
00:22:21,701 --> 00:22:23,140
We don't want any more trouble.

302
00:22:25,927 --> 00:22:28,442
Well, you don't start none,
there won't be none.

303
00:22:28,442 --> 00:22:30,399
Now you all sleep tight.

304
00:22:30,399 --> 00:22:32,874
Don't let the bed bugs bite.

305
00:22:32,874 --> 00:22:34,431
I'll get that car of yours
towed in the morning.

306
00:22:34,431 --> 00:22:37,027
In the meantime, I suggest you
wash this lady's mouth out.

307
00:22:39,462 --> 00:22:42,097
Now y'all get the hell
out of my car.

308
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:22,500
Nice, Motel Royal Vista.

309
00:23:22,500 --> 00:23:25,490
This is really romantic, Don.

310
00:23:35,061 --> 00:23:37,892
They're probably sleeping.

311
00:23:37,892 --> 00:23:39,088
Like we should be.

312
00:23:39,088 --> 00:23:41,681
This is romantic,
thank you!

313
00:23:41,681 --> 00:23:44,275
These are the kind of moments
that bring people closer.

314
00:23:59,185 --> 00:24:02,174
Hello!

315
00:24:02,174 --> 00:24:03,209
Hello?

316
00:24:03,209 --> 00:24:05,958
Hello!

317
00:24:05,958 --> 00:24:07,313
Hello.

318
00:24:07,313 --> 00:24:10,021
Oh, my God.

319
00:24:10,021 --> 00:24:12,293
Oh, my God,
this place is disgusting!

320
00:24:24,274 --> 00:24:25,668
I am so sorry!

321
00:24:25,668 --> 00:24:29,648
Wasn't expecting anybody in
this late.

322
00:24:29,648 --> 00:24:31,518
This is our slow season.

323
00:24:31,518 --> 00:24:33,469
Yeah, I'll bet.

324
00:24:33,469 --> 00:24:36,332
Um, we had an accident
down the road.

325
00:24:36,332 --> 00:24:40,512
Sheriff brought us here,
said you could get us a room.

326
00:24:40,512 --> 00:24:42,421
The sheriff brought you here?

327
00:24:42,421 --> 00:24:43,853
Yeah, that creepy sheriff.

328
00:24:43,853 --> 00:24:45,644
He kicked us out of his car.

329
00:24:47,117 --> 00:24:50,380
Yeah, that old Cleveland can be
a real son of a bitch sometimes.

330
00:24:50,380 --> 00:24:53,325
You know, I sang in the choir,
third grade, with him.

331
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:54,638
Couldn't carry a tune
to save his life.

332
00:24:54,638 --> 00:24:56,985
Yep, we heard.

333
00:24:58,140 --> 00:24:59,772
Uh, look, I don't want
to be rude,

334
00:24:59,772 --> 00:25:01,283
but we're pretty tired

335
00:25:01,283 --> 00:25:03,910
and we gotta get an early start
in the morning.

336
00:25:03,910 --> 00:25:06,258
So, uh, do you have a vacancy?

337
00:25:11,570 --> 00:25:13,041
Oh, sure, sure, sure!

338
00:25:13,041 --> 00:25:14,910
I forgot you big-city types

339
00:25:14,910 --> 00:25:18,805
don't always like
this small town chit-chat.

340
00:25:18,805 --> 00:25:21,947
Let me get you all fixed up.

341
00:25:21,947 --> 00:25:23,218
Can we get the cleanest room,
please?

342
00:25:23,218 --> 00:25:27,350
Around here,
we believe that cleanliness

343
00:25:27,350 --> 00:25:29,062
is next to godliness.

344
00:25:35,022 --> 00:25:36,254
Well, what do you need?

345
00:25:36,254 --> 00:25:37,960
King room would be ideal.

346
00:25:37,960 --> 00:25:40,943
King suite?

347
00:25:40,943 --> 00:25:45,153
$129.99.

348
00:25:45,153 --> 00:25:47,696
What?

349
00:25:47,696 --> 00:25:49,643
Oh, come on,
that's unbelievable!

350
00:25:49,643 --> 00:25:51,987
It is!

351
00:25:51,987 --> 00:25:54,848
We cater mostly
to the corporate type.

352
00:25:58,426 --> 00:26:01,321
A1 Trucking out of Appaloosas.

353
00:26:01,321 --> 00:26:02,709
It's our biggest customer,

354
00:26:02,709 --> 00:26:04,932
and they usually have us
full up.

355
00:26:04,932 --> 00:26:07,273
I'm sure.

356
00:26:07,273 --> 00:26:08,584
Take American Express?

357
00:26:08,584 --> 00:26:12,154
Oh, we gladly accept
all major credit cards.

358
00:26:12,154 --> 00:26:15,646
Great.

359
00:26:15,646 --> 00:26:18,027
Well, if you excuse me
for a minute,

360
00:26:18,027 --> 00:26:20,370
our credit card machine
is there in the back.

361
00:26:20,370 --> 00:26:22,113
I'll give it
a little swiping,

362
00:26:22,113 --> 00:26:23,066
be right back here.

363
00:26:23,066 --> 00:26:24,178
Don't you go anywhere.

364
00:26:50,464 --> 00:26:53,792
Uh, I'm really sorry,

365
00:26:53,792 --> 00:26:54,781
but there seems to be
some problem with your card.

366
00:26:54,781 --> 00:26:55,970
What?

367
00:26:55,970 --> 00:26:57,117
Problem?

368
00:26:57,117 --> 00:26:58,228
Can I use your phone?
Let me call them.

369
00:26:58,228 --> 00:26:59,733
Not to worry!

370
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,745
It's kind of slow
around here tonight.

371
00:27:02,745 --> 00:27:06,625
You've already told me how you
two have had a tough evening.

372
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:10,192
So your room tonight will be
complimentary, on us.

373
00:27:10,232 --> 00:27:12,808
Just a little old southern
hospitality!

374
00:27:15,779 --> 00:27:17,322
I can even turn on
those dirty movie channels

375
00:27:17,322 --> 00:27:20,850
if you want to blow off
a little steam.

376
00:27:20,850 --> 00:27:21,918
How thoughtful.

377
00:27:21,918 --> 00:27:22,909
We'll be okay.

378
00:27:22,909 --> 00:27:25,087
We just want to get some sleep.

379
00:27:28,653 --> 00:27:29,960
We're gonna need the key.

380
00:27:29,960 --> 00:27:31,584
Oh no, it's all friendly
around here.

381
00:27:31,584 --> 00:27:33,448
Nothing's locked up.

382
00:27:35,869 --> 00:27:37,293
You just take, uh, room 4.

383
00:27:37,293 --> 00:27:38,797
Just down the way there.

384
00:27:38,797 --> 00:27:40,301
Feel free to buzz me up front

385
00:27:40,301 --> 00:27:41,728
if you need anything at all.

386
00:27:41,728 --> 00:27:44,854
Dial 0, I'll be
at your beck and call.

387
00:27:44,854 --> 00:27:46,598
Thank you, good night.

388
00:27:49,722 --> 00:27:50,791
Sleep tight now!

389
00:28:31,118 --> 00:28:33,529
Dispatch, I'm in the area
and there's no car in sight.

390
00:28:33,529 --> 00:28:35,857
Are you sure
this is the right location?

391
00:28:35,857 --> 00:28:38,072
RADIO:
10-4, 313, mile marker 21.

392
00:28:38,072 --> 00:28:39,731
Looks like they must have got it
up and running.

393
00:28:39,731 --> 00:28:41,827
I'm heading back to my post.

394
00:28:41,827 --> 00:28:44,001
10-4.

395
00:28:53,840 --> 00:28:55,934
Oh, my God!

396
00:28:55,934 --> 00:28:58,343
Ugh, I'm definitely catching
a disease tonight.

397
00:29:00,987 --> 00:29:02,448
Well, I tell you after 8 years
in the marine corps,

398
00:29:02,448 --> 00:29:03,358
it'd take a lot worse than this
to scare me.

399
00:29:03,358 --> 00:29:05,528
Aren't you the macho man?

400
00:29:08,649 --> 00:29:12,045
Maybe I can sleep standing up
like a giraffe.

401
00:29:12,045 --> 00:29:13,939
Well, you already sleepwalk,

402
00:29:13,939 --> 00:29:16,029
so it would be
the next natural step.

403
00:29:16,029 --> 00:29:19,229
Maybe I could break
the world's record

404
00:29:21,637 --> 00:29:24,282
with saying "Fuck you"
enough times in one night.

405
00:29:24,282 --> 00:29:26,609
No, I think you've already
achieved that goal, Nancy.

406
00:29:26,609 --> 00:29:29,685
You may want to set the bar
a little higher.

407
00:29:29,685 --> 00:29:31,382
TV's broken.

408
00:29:31,382 --> 00:29:35,446
Oh my God, what is that?

409
00:29:35,746 --> 00:29:36,868
Don, there's blood on the wall!

410
00:29:40,812 --> 00:29:44,121
You sure?

411
00:29:44,121 --> 00:29:46,323
There's blood on the wall!

412
00:29:49,987 --> 00:29:51,406
Yeah, it's still wet.

413
00:29:51,406 --> 00:29:53,651
Ugh!

414
00:29:53,651 --> 00:29:56,329
Those A1 truckers
must like it rough.

415
00:29:56,329 --> 00:29:58,731
I am not staying here.

416
00:30:02,865 --> 00:30:04,679
Huh.

417
00:30:10,274 --> 00:30:12,243
We are leaving at 7:45 a.m.

418
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:13,266
No later!

419
00:30:13,266 --> 00:30:15,826
That was the plan.

420
00:30:15,826 --> 00:30:19,645
He didn't turn the porn on.

421
00:30:19,645 --> 00:30:21,339
Well, let's get some sleep.

422
00:30:28,573 --> 00:30:29,753
Oh, bed's comfortable.

423
00:30:41,601 --> 00:30:44,828
You're taking way
too much time, Jonas.

424
00:30:47,328 --> 00:30:48,349
God, Cleveland!

425
00:30:48,349 --> 00:30:50,120
Will you just let me log in?

426
00:30:50,120 --> 00:30:53,659
Why you always move so slow?

427
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:55,784
I'm going as fast as I can.

428
00:31:01,366 --> 00:31:03,725
Well, better hurry up
because we got a lot to do.

429
00:31:03,725 --> 00:31:04,902
We ain't got much time.

430
00:31:04,902 --> 00:31:06,240
I'm hurrying, all right?

431
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,576
I almost got the list
sent out to everybody.

432
00:31:07,576 --> 00:31:08,874
The whole list, all right?

433
00:31:17,330 --> 00:31:19,448
There, it's gone.

434
00:31:19,448 --> 00:31:20,706
It's about time.

435
00:31:23,494 --> 00:31:24,478
You idiot.

436
00:31:29,150 --> 00:31:33,473
Yes, sir, we can get a private
room for the congressman.

437
00:31:33,473 --> 00:31:35,832
That's right.

438
00:31:35,832 --> 00:31:37,478
From now on,

439
00:31:37,478 --> 00:31:41,210
he's gonna be known
as, uh, R15.

440
00:31:41,210 --> 00:31:43,489
Yeah, that's right.

441
00:32:23,991 --> 00:32:25,869
Don, put that down.

442
00:32:25,869 --> 00:32:27,200
That's disgusting.

443
00:32:27,200 --> 00:32:29,863
It's right
on the bar of soap.

444
00:32:29,863 --> 00:32:31,586
It's gross,
put that down!

445
00:32:31,586 --> 00:32:33,272
How did it get there?

446
00:32:33,272 --> 00:32:34,916
That's an article
you could write.

447
00:32:34,916 --> 00:32:35,972
Thrilling.

448
00:32:35,972 --> 00:32:38,988
You can almost see yourself
in this mirror.

449
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:42,707
Huh.

450
00:32:45,682 --> 00:32:49,715
Well, been an interesting
evening.

451
00:33:37,044 --> 00:33:39,662
Morning cannot come
soon enough.

452
00:33:45,249 --> 00:33:47,474
You know what this
reminds me of?

453
00:33:52,008 --> 00:33:54,237
Summer vacation bible school.

454
00:33:57,059 --> 00:33:58,892
What?

455
00:33:58,892 --> 00:34:00,570
Remember?

456
00:34:00,570 --> 00:34:03,066
The boys and girls had to sleep
in separate cabins,

457
00:34:03,066 --> 00:34:04,393
and for good reason.

458
00:34:04,393 --> 00:34:07,632
And you snuck into mine.

459
00:34:07,632 --> 00:34:08,845
We were so scared all we did
was hold each other

460
00:34:08,845 --> 00:34:10,130
and talk all night.

461
00:34:10,130 --> 00:34:11,261
We didn't even kiss.

462
00:34:12,159 --> 00:34:16,453
That's because
you were too scared.

463
00:34:16,453 --> 00:34:17,351
Oh, you were scared too.

464
00:34:19,457 --> 00:34:22,502
But when you finally did,
a week later...

465
00:34:26,718 --> 00:34:29,761
your lips were trembling.

466
00:34:42,397 --> 00:34:43,451
Where did we go wrong?

467
00:34:51,360 --> 00:34:55,527
Do you think I wanted it
to be like this?

468
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:58,918
Every girl wants the perfect
marriage and the perfect family.

469
00:34:58,918 --> 00:35:03,046
Nancy, I said I was sorry.

470
00:35:06,619 --> 00:35:08,604
I made a mistake.

471
00:35:08,604 --> 00:35:10,238
I'm sorry.

472
00:35:10,238 --> 00:35:14,560
Counselor said we just need
to relearn to communicate.

473
00:35:17,007 --> 00:35:19,301
That's why we went
on this trip, Nancy.

474
00:35:19,301 --> 00:35:22,804
But all you've done so far
is yell at me.

475
00:35:22,804 --> 00:35:25,842
What am I supposed to do
with all the anger?

476
00:35:32,880 --> 00:35:35,956
I made a mistake.

477
00:35:35,956 --> 00:35:38,055
A big one.

478
00:35:42,093 --> 00:35:45,083
That is the truest thing
that you have said all night.

479
00:35:48,268 --> 00:35:50,212
You know, I'm the one
popping Paxil.

480
00:35:50,212 --> 00:35:52,852
I'm the one popping
fertility drugs.

481
00:35:52,852 --> 00:35:55,298
I'm the one doing everything
that I can.

482
00:35:55,298 --> 00:35:56,699
I can't just stop feelings.

483
00:36:01,978 --> 00:36:03,374
I want to make it work.

484
00:36:03,374 --> 00:36:05,436
Baby, I'm gonna make it up
to you.

485
00:36:05,436 --> 00:36:06,290
Just give me another chance.

486
00:36:06,290 --> 00:36:08,619
I am just so angry.

487
00:36:08,619 --> 00:36:10,677
I'm angry at everybody
and everything,

488
00:36:10,677 --> 00:36:12,658
and I am not an angry person.

489
00:36:12,658 --> 00:36:14,175
I do not want to be
an angry person.

490
00:36:14,175 --> 00:36:17,706
And you're the one who made me
an angry person.

491
00:36:24,903 --> 00:36:28,312
I guess somebody checked in
next door.

492
00:36:28,312 --> 00:36:29,748
Yeah, checked in with a bang.

493
00:36:32,153 --> 00:36:34,865
God!

494
00:36:36,454 --> 00:36:38,160
What the hell?

495
00:36:44,443 --> 00:36:46,572
Hey, mind your own business.

496
00:36:53,629 --> 00:36:56,496
I want what they're drinking.

497
00:36:56,496 --> 00:36:58,707
Hey, I got an idea for you.

498
00:36:58,707 --> 00:37:00,995
You should write an article.

499
00:37:04,605 --> 00:37:06,460
Great sex in nasty hotels.

500
00:37:09,131 --> 00:37:11,959
I could probably win
the Pulitzer with that one.

501
00:37:13,350 --> 00:37:14,862
Holy shit.

502
00:37:14,862 --> 00:37:16,410
That's enough.

503
00:37:16,410 --> 00:37:17,685
Go talk to them.

504
00:37:17,685 --> 00:37:18,693
You want me to go over there?

505
00:37:18,693 --> 00:37:20,125
Yes!

506
00:37:20,125 --> 00:37:22,095
We're not gonna put up
with that all night.

507
00:37:22,095 --> 00:37:24,268
Go talk to them.

508
00:37:24,268 --> 00:37:25,973
All right.

509
00:37:46,223 --> 00:37:47,306
Sir, may I help you?

510
00:37:47,306 --> 00:37:49,275
Yeah, look, I'm, uh, sorry
to disturb you,

511
00:37:49,275 --> 00:37:51,670
but, um, I'm in the next room

512
00:37:51,670 --> 00:37:53,638
and my wife and I have just been
to hell and back

513
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:55,533
and well, we've been through
a rough night.

514
00:37:55,533 --> 00:37:58,467
Just appreciate it if you could
keep the noise down.

515
00:37:58,467 --> 00:38:00,361
Yeah, sure.

516
00:38:00,361 --> 00:38:02,252
Sorry to disturb you.

517
00:38:02,252 --> 00:38:04,417
Thanks.

518
00:38:04,454 --> 00:38:05,961
Hey!

519
00:38:05,961 --> 00:38:08,744
I'll give you $1,000
if you drive us into town?

520
00:38:13,512 --> 00:38:14,939
No, no, no thank you.

521
00:38:30,283 --> 00:38:31,362
What'd they say?

522
00:38:31,362 --> 00:38:32,289
They said they'd tone it down.

523
00:38:32,289 --> 00:38:34,677
Thank you.

524
00:38:34,677 --> 00:38:36,295
Yep.

525
00:38:40,383 --> 00:38:41,925
Maybe we can get a little
shut-eye before morning.

526
00:38:41,925 --> 00:38:42,887
Yeah.

527
00:38:57,568 --> 00:39:00,144
I got you covered.

528
00:39:00,144 --> 00:39:02,071
Yeah, no problem.

529
00:39:02,071 --> 00:39:04,337
Same place as before, right?

530
00:39:04,337 --> 00:39:06,028
Same place.

531
00:39:20,457 --> 00:39:21,958
You back again, huh?

532
00:39:28,070 --> 00:39:30,645
I wouldn't miss this
for the world.

533
00:39:34,677 --> 00:39:36,019
Have fun, boys.

534
00:40:04,352 --> 00:40:06,385
I got you something better
than those ponchos.

535
00:40:07,418 --> 00:40:09,684
Yeah, besides they sell for more
as sex slaves.

536
00:40:09,684 --> 00:40:10,796
Yeah.

537
00:40:10,796 --> 00:40:13,059
Got you this one.

538
00:40:13,059 --> 00:40:15,089
Ah, how about this?

539
00:40:15,089 --> 00:40:16,546
Oh!

540
00:40:16,546 --> 00:40:18,852
Fresh shipment of young hookers
from the Ukraine,

541
00:40:18,852 --> 00:40:20,009
or former Yugoslavia.

542
00:40:20,509 --> 00:40:21,980
Who cares, huh?

543
00:40:25,370 --> 00:40:27,973
You can't beat this
with a bat, man.

544
00:40:27,973 --> 00:40:29,580
How much?

545
00:40:29,580 --> 00:40:32,340
A thousand a piece.

546
00:40:32,340 --> 00:40:33,220
Oh, no, no, no, no.

547
00:40:33,220 --> 00:40:34,290
We said 250.

548
00:40:34,290 --> 00:40:36,969
But these here are, um,
multipurpose, man.

549
00:40:37,813 --> 00:40:39,880
Come on, look,
look what you got here.

550
00:40:39,880 --> 00:40:43,208
Okay, hey, hey,
I'm a businessman, you know?

551
00:40:44,394 --> 00:40:46,731
What, uh--

552
00:40:51,748 --> 00:40:54,157
You tell Carter Fairbanks
it's a pleasure.

553
00:40:54,157 --> 00:40:56,415
And maybe, uh,
maybe next year,

554
00:40:59,770 --> 00:41:01,338
I'll find out the location

555
00:41:01,338 --> 00:41:03,934
and I can be there
the night of the big show.

556
00:41:07,737 --> 00:41:10,580
The shit we get ourselves
into, huh?

557
00:41:12,811 --> 00:41:17,080
My grandmother told me to,
um, join the air force,

558
00:41:17,080 --> 00:41:19,658
stay single,
and be done with it.

559
00:41:19,658 --> 00:41:23,771
But no, I wanted to be
a journalist, look for love.

560
00:41:23,771 --> 00:41:26,350
Well, your grandmother
was a mean, lonely woman.

561
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,078
She was a 4-star general.

562
00:41:34,120 --> 00:41:36,230
Oh, for crying out loud.

563
00:41:38,690 --> 00:41:39,687
Forget it, I'm not--

564
00:41:39,687 --> 00:41:40,839
No, no, no, no, no,
go please!

565
00:41:42,913 --> 00:41:46,945
All right.

566
00:41:46,945 --> 00:41:48,328
Thank you.

567
00:43:33,772 --> 00:43:34,827
What's going on?

568
00:43:34,827 --> 00:43:36,070
Shit!

569
00:43:36,070 --> 00:43:37,475
You gotta stay calm, okay?

570
00:43:37,475 --> 00:43:39,581
Don't ask any questions.

571
00:43:39,581 --> 00:43:43,172
Just do what I tell you to do,
okay?

572
00:43:43,172 --> 00:43:46,991
Tell me what's going on!

573
00:43:46,991 --> 00:43:48,942
Don, what is going on?

574
00:43:50,736 --> 00:43:53,584
You gotta tell me
what's going on!

575
00:43:53,584 --> 00:43:55,728
They killed a girl.

576
00:43:57,909 --> 00:43:58,805
What?

577
00:43:58,805 --> 00:43:59,661
Right next door,
they killed somebody!

578
00:44:10,686 --> 00:44:12,476
I saw them through the window.

579
00:44:12,476 --> 00:44:13,409
That's crazy!

580
00:44:18,451 --> 00:44:19,537
Get in the closet!
Get in the closet!

581
00:44:19,537 --> 00:44:20,862
We got a good one.

582
00:44:20,862 --> 00:44:22,652
Go!

583
00:45:00,987 --> 00:45:02,540
Nancy!

584
00:45:02,540 --> 00:45:03,358
I think they're gone.

585
00:45:06,030 --> 00:45:07,118
Are you sure?

586
00:45:07,118 --> 00:45:08,438
Yeah, come here.

587
00:45:08,438 --> 00:45:09,408
You see that Buick?

588
00:45:09,408 --> 00:45:10,300
Yeah.

589
00:45:10,300 --> 00:45:13,439
That's our escape right there.

590
00:45:13,439 --> 00:45:15,845
I can hotwire it.

591
00:45:15,845 --> 00:45:17,205
Okay.

592
00:45:17,205 --> 00:45:19,026
All right.

593
00:45:19,026 --> 00:45:21,627
Let's get the fuck out of here,
all right?

594
00:45:27,046 --> 00:45:27,941
Ready?

595
00:45:40,486 --> 00:45:43,857
Look, that car.

596
00:45:43,896 --> 00:45:46,026
Maybe the keys are under
the visor or something.

597
00:45:46,026 --> 00:45:47,303
Looks good there,
let's go.

598
00:45:59,658 --> 00:46:01,752
This way!

599
00:46:01,752 --> 00:46:03,410
Oh, my God!

600
00:46:04,455 --> 00:46:05,769
Come on!

601
00:46:06,969 --> 00:46:09,869
Ahh!

602
00:46:33,286 --> 00:46:34,521
Holy fuck!

603
00:46:34,521 --> 00:46:37,724
Oh, my God,
what are we going to do?

604
00:46:37,724 --> 00:46:39,691
Fuck!

605
00:46:51,873 --> 00:46:53,145
Well, hello there,
big-city boy!

606
00:46:53,145 --> 00:46:55,342
Looks like you found yourself

607
00:46:55,342 --> 00:46:56,607
in the wrong place
at the wrong time.

608
00:46:56,607 --> 00:46:57,881
What do you want?

609
00:46:57,881 --> 00:46:58,807
You want money?

610
00:46:58,807 --> 00:46:59,731
I can get you money!

611
00:46:59,731 --> 00:47:00,615
I can get you $1000 cash.

612
00:47:00,615 --> 00:47:02,194
Take me to an ATM right now!

613
00:47:02,194 --> 00:47:03,929
Now what makes you think
I want your money?

614
00:47:03,929 --> 00:47:05,738
Why are you doing this, huh?

615
00:47:07,801 --> 00:47:09,073
What kind of sick shit is this?

616
00:47:09,073 --> 00:47:10,454
What are you doing this for?

617
00:47:10,454 --> 00:47:11,644
Hey now, who you calling sick?

618
00:47:11,644 --> 00:47:14,148
You're the one who
almost killed somebody.

619
00:47:14,148 --> 00:47:15,495
So you want to play rough,
city boy, huh?

620
00:47:15,495 --> 00:47:17,302
Tell him that my dad's
a U.S. Senator.

621
00:47:17,302 --> 00:47:18,149
Tell him!

622
00:47:18,149 --> 00:47:20,151
Hey, little lady there!

623
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:21,765
Even the President
of the United States of America

624
00:47:21,765 --> 00:47:23,304
ain't gonna get you
out of this fix.

625
00:47:24,423 --> 00:47:26,844
What the fuck did
we ever do to you?

626
00:47:26,844 --> 00:47:28,382
You sound like a gambling man,

627
00:47:28,382 --> 00:47:30,767
since you was going
to the casino and all.

628
00:47:33,246 --> 00:47:35,281
So how about we-- how about we
make ourselves a little bet?

629
00:47:35,281 --> 00:47:36,515
How about that?

630
00:47:36,515 --> 00:47:37,779
What?

631
00:47:37,779 --> 00:47:39,624
Did you see that white Buick
out in the parking lot?

632
00:47:39,624 --> 00:47:40,852
I know you saw it
when we was coming in.

633
00:47:40,852 --> 00:47:41,929
We call her old Betsy.

634
00:47:41,929 --> 00:47:44,692
She got about a, oh,
a half tank of gas in there.

635
00:47:44,692 --> 00:47:45,692
That ought to get you
to Lafayette,

636
00:47:45,692 --> 00:47:48,263
where your wife can take
a nice, hot shower.

637
00:47:48,263 --> 00:47:49,843
They even sell beer
after midnight.

638
00:47:51,262 --> 00:47:53,027
Key's under the visor.

639
00:47:53,027 --> 00:47:55,411
What do you say?

640
00:47:58,112 --> 00:48:00,260
What's the bet?

641
00:48:00,260 --> 00:48:02,212
Well, the bet is if you make it
to the car,

642
00:48:02,212 --> 00:48:03,744
you can drive out of here.

643
00:48:03,744 --> 00:48:05,857
And if you don't?

644
00:48:05,857 --> 00:48:07,967
Well, you don't!

645
00:48:08,961 --> 00:48:11,910
How do we know the car runs?

646
00:48:11,910 --> 00:48:13,412
'Cause I'm a man of my word,
goddamn it!

647
00:48:13,412 --> 00:48:15,290
I'm the law!

648
00:48:15,290 --> 00:48:17,662
I took an oath!

649
00:48:23,348 --> 00:48:25,994
Jesus, you scared the shit
out of me, Cleveland.

650
00:48:25,994 --> 00:48:29,511
What?

651
00:48:29,511 --> 00:48:31,311
What is it?

652
00:48:31,346 --> 00:48:33,106
He said there's a car out here.

653
00:48:33,106 --> 00:48:34,559
A car?

654
00:48:47,955 --> 00:48:49,160
Come on.

655
00:48:53,822 --> 00:48:56,145
All right.

656
00:48:56,145 --> 00:48:58,707
I saw him going
around the corner.

657
00:48:58,707 --> 00:48:59,756
Let's go.

658
00:48:59,756 --> 00:49:00,611
Over there?

659
00:49:03,249 --> 00:49:04,259
Oh, my God!

660
00:49:04,259 --> 00:49:07,012
Can you see it?

661
00:49:07,012 --> 00:49:09,456
It's right there,
all right?

662
00:49:09,456 --> 00:49:10,698
Okay.

663
00:49:10,698 --> 00:49:11,903
Let's go.

664
00:49:11,903 --> 00:49:13,375
No, wait!
What?

665
00:49:13,375 --> 00:49:16,524
It's too easy.

666
00:49:16,524 --> 00:49:19,548
Well, what other choice
do we have?

667
00:49:23,156 --> 00:49:25,022
Okay.

668
00:49:28,983 --> 00:49:30,338
Don, Don!

669
00:49:30,338 --> 00:49:32,117
Oh, my God!
Come on!

670
00:49:39,857 --> 00:49:41,639
Ahh!

671
00:49:41,639 --> 00:49:43,417
Go, go!

672
00:49:43,417 --> 00:49:44,772
Argh!

673
00:50:07,731 --> 00:50:08,853
Check the window.

674
00:50:12,787 --> 00:50:14,484
Oh, my God,
they're gone.

675
00:50:32,846 --> 00:50:33,928
I love you.

676
00:50:33,928 --> 00:50:35,706
I love you too.

677
00:50:35,706 --> 00:50:37,396
I love you.

678
00:51:04,786 --> 00:51:06,864
I see, compadre,
you got some cojones.

679
00:51:07,898 --> 00:51:09,051
Hell, this is gonna be
more fun than I thought.

680
00:51:09,051 --> 00:51:12,510
You told me if we made it
to the car, we could go.

681
00:51:12,510 --> 00:51:15,661
I'm gonna have to delegate
that answer to my associate.

682
00:51:15,661 --> 00:51:17,459
Sorry, brother.

683
00:51:17,459 --> 00:51:19,423
I decided to change my mind.

684
00:51:19,423 --> 00:51:21,920
Hey, you listen to me,
you sick fuck!

685
00:51:24,492 --> 00:51:26,140
You think this is a game?

686
00:51:26,140 --> 00:51:28,435
We're gonna change the rules
a little.

687
00:51:28,435 --> 00:51:31,426
We're gonna let my wife go,
and then I'm gonna give up.

688
00:51:31,426 --> 00:51:32,617
I'm gonna make it easy on you.

689
00:51:32,617 --> 00:51:33,919
Young man, I make the rules
around here.

690
00:51:33,919 --> 00:51:35,298
You live when I say you live,

691
00:51:35,298 --> 00:51:36,447
and you die
when I say you die--

692
00:51:40,167 --> 00:51:42,890
We are gonna die in here.

693
00:51:42,890 --> 00:51:44,694
Listen to me,
listen to me.

694
00:51:44,694 --> 00:51:45,613
We are not gonna die.

695
00:51:48,216 --> 00:51:51,005
We just need a plan.

696
00:51:51,005 --> 00:51:52,309
So, look around,
check in the drawers.

697
00:51:52,309 --> 00:51:54,949
Look for something,
anything, all right?

698
00:52:02,253 --> 00:52:06,120
Wait a minute.

699
00:52:06,120 --> 00:52:10,022
If he called us,
maybe we can call out.

700
00:52:19,827 --> 00:52:21,538
Dial tone.

701
00:52:26,619 --> 00:52:29,041
It's ringing.

702
00:52:29,041 --> 00:52:30,367
Hello!

703
00:52:30,367 --> 00:52:33,452
Hello, listen, somebody
is trying to kill us!

704
00:52:33,452 --> 00:52:35,479
We're at the Motel Royal Vista!

705
00:52:35,479 --> 00:52:37,006
Route 16, Garcia Parish.

706
00:52:37,006 --> 00:52:38,141
Didn't your mama ever tell you

707
00:52:38,141 --> 00:52:40,983
that it wasn't nice
to be a tattle tale?

708
00:52:40,983 --> 00:52:42,005
Hmm?

709
00:52:42,005 --> 00:52:43,759
Well, it's not.

710
00:52:43,759 --> 00:52:47,547
Now you're gonna have to get
a little spanking.

711
00:52:47,547 --> 00:52:49,697
Go on over there
and look out that window.

712
00:53:06,886 --> 00:53:09,024
Yeah, that's just in case

713
00:53:09,024 --> 00:53:10,783
the state troopers
come snooping around,

714
00:53:10,783 --> 00:53:13,153
or maybe some detective
wondering what happened to you.

715
00:53:13,153 --> 00:53:16,504
Look, I'll tell you
what I'm gonna do.

716
00:53:16,504 --> 00:53:18,333
If you call this thing off,

717
00:53:18,333 --> 00:53:21,133
first thing in the morning,
we can call my banker.

718
00:53:21,133 --> 00:53:23,002
I'll have a quarter of a million
dollars wired into your account

719
00:53:23,002 --> 00:53:24,761
Anywhere, anywhere you want!

720
00:53:24,761 --> 00:53:27,170
No questions asked.

721
00:53:31,567 --> 00:53:35,838
Hey, big-city boy,
didn't your mama ever tell you

722
00:53:35,838 --> 00:53:39,873
all the finer things in life
are free?

723
00:53:39,873 --> 00:53:42,078
Listen to me,
you are gonna burn in hell!

724
00:53:42,078 --> 00:53:44,761
You are gonna burn in fucking
hell, you mother-fucker!

725
00:53:44,761 --> 00:53:46,043
Yeah.

726
00:53:52,131 --> 00:53:53,370
We're out of time.

727
00:53:53,370 --> 00:53:54,304
We got to do something.

728
00:53:54,304 --> 00:53:55,117
We got to do it now.

729
00:54:02,335 --> 00:54:04,042
Come in.

730
00:54:06,138 --> 00:54:07,027
Got your cut, boss.

731
00:54:07,027 --> 00:54:07,883
It's about time.

732
00:54:13,324 --> 00:54:14,566
Well, you know,
I just love the smell of--

733
00:54:14,566 --> 00:54:17,278
Mmm, blood money.

734
00:54:17,278 --> 00:54:19,018
Yes, sir.

735
00:54:19,018 --> 00:54:22,576
Comes fast, spends fast.

736
00:54:22,576 --> 00:54:24,319
Almost like the days
of Ancient Rome

737
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:28,577
when gladiators used to fight
to the death.

738
00:54:28,577 --> 00:54:29,545
Why, yes, sir.

739
00:54:29,545 --> 00:54:31,016
Yes, sir, just like them
gladiators.

740
00:54:31,016 --> 00:54:34,497
Entertained the crowds.

741
00:54:34,497 --> 00:54:36,204
Any way you slice it,

742
00:54:38,287 --> 00:54:40,922
people will always pay money
to see blood hit the floor.

743
00:54:44,638 --> 00:54:46,027
Pays better than pussy.

744
00:54:46,027 --> 00:54:48,809
Better than poon tang?

745
00:54:48,809 --> 00:54:50,502
Shh, I don't know
about all that.

746
00:54:50,502 --> 00:54:51,546
Trust me.

747
00:54:51,546 --> 00:54:52,468
You're right.

748
00:54:52,468 --> 00:54:54,400
You take care
of them VIP customers?

749
00:54:54,400 --> 00:54:55,632
I did, I did.

750
00:54:55,632 --> 00:54:56,789
Took care of them very well.

751
00:54:56,789 --> 00:54:58,335
All right.

752
00:54:58,335 --> 00:55:00,997
Well, I am proud
to be an American.

753
00:55:00,997 --> 00:55:03,962
And I hope that you are too.

754
00:55:03,962 --> 00:55:05,319
I am.

755
00:55:05,319 --> 00:55:06,511
Well, take this from me,
it's a gift,

756
00:55:06,551 --> 00:55:09,215
and listen to it
every single day.

757
00:55:13,093 --> 00:55:15,936
And behave yourself.

758
00:55:22,434 --> 00:55:25,325
Okay, it's $10,000.

759
00:55:25,325 --> 00:55:26,774
It's your half.

760
00:55:33,919 --> 00:55:37,676
Supposed to be $12,000

761
00:55:37,676 --> 00:55:39,354
No, it's 10.

762
00:55:39,354 --> 00:55:41,580
You said you were gonna find me
some redheads this time.

763
00:55:41,580 --> 00:55:43,334
You know they like redheads.

764
00:55:43,334 --> 00:55:45,135
It's 12.

765
00:55:45,135 --> 00:55:47,287
Why don't you go to hell?

766
00:56:13,942 --> 00:56:16,702
I want two things, Jonas.

767
00:56:16,702 --> 00:56:18,842
$12,000 and respect.

768
00:56:23,236 --> 00:56:26,310
Because I am the law.

769
00:56:26,310 --> 00:56:28,878
Now, you better start figuring
out how you're gonna count

770
00:56:28,878 --> 00:56:31,207
another $2,000 off that stack,

771
00:56:31,207 --> 00:56:33,223
or I'm gonna have to figure out

772
00:56:33,223 --> 00:56:35,215
how I'm gonna wipe your brains
off that wall

773
00:56:35,215 --> 00:56:36,423
before we open in the morning.

774
00:56:39,797 --> 00:56:41,927
Now, hold on, Cleveland.

775
00:56:47,235 --> 00:56:49,833
Uh, I was just pulling
your chain, man.

776
00:56:49,833 --> 00:56:50,763
There.

777
00:56:50,763 --> 00:56:53,319
That's more than your share.

778
00:56:53,319 --> 00:56:55,065
It's all good.

779
00:56:56,307 --> 00:56:58,829
You ever tell me
to go to hell again,

780
00:56:58,829 --> 00:57:03,089
I swear to God
I will kill you on the spot.

781
00:57:03,089 --> 00:57:06,149
Never happen again.

782
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:12,358
Goddamn, I'm--

783
00:57:12,358 --> 00:57:13,676
I'm getting thirsty.

784
00:57:20,069 --> 00:57:22,235
Couple beers?

785
00:57:22,235 --> 00:57:23,705
That's a good idea.

786
00:57:23,705 --> 00:57:25,367
Yeah, sounds good.

787
00:57:44,613 --> 00:57:45,935
Don, come here!

788
00:57:45,935 --> 00:57:48,411
Someone must have called
the fire department.

789
00:57:48,411 --> 00:57:50,187
Wait, wait!

790
00:57:50,187 --> 00:57:52,007
We don't know who's who.

791
00:57:52,007 --> 00:57:53,576
It's the fire department.

792
00:57:53,576 --> 00:57:54,651
They're here to help us!

793
00:57:54,651 --> 00:57:55,722
Come on,
this is our only shot.

794
00:57:55,722 --> 00:57:57,211
We gotta make sure
they're legit.

795
00:57:59,439 --> 00:58:01,133
Jonas.

796
00:58:01,133 --> 00:58:03,782
Yeah, everything's all set,
just like you want, Carter.

797
00:58:03,782 --> 00:58:06,541
Yeah, we're right here.

798
00:58:06,541 --> 00:58:08,736
Don't you worry
about a thing, boss.

799
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:10,554
We got it covered.

800
00:58:24,313 --> 00:58:26,870
Well, looks like he's here
to put the fire out.

801
00:58:29,601 --> 00:58:32,686
I don't see anybody.

802
00:58:32,686 --> 00:58:34,458
Okay, come on right, okay.

803
00:58:34,458 --> 00:58:36,437
Look.

804
00:58:36,437 --> 00:58:39,440
When I open the door, we run
as fast as we can right to him.

805
00:58:39,440 --> 00:58:42,325
Okay, we don't stop.

806
00:58:42,325 --> 00:58:43,929
Straight there, all right?

807
00:58:43,929 --> 00:58:44,999
Yes.

808
00:58:44,999 --> 00:58:46,436
We use his radio
to call for help.

809
00:58:53,813 --> 00:58:55,500
Go, go!

810
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:57,189
Hey, hey, hey!

811
00:58:57,189 --> 00:58:58,586
Oh, my God, thank you so much
for coming here!

812
00:58:58,586 --> 00:58:59,537
They're trying to kill us!

813
00:58:59,537 --> 00:59:00,483
One second, one second!

814
00:59:00,483 --> 00:59:01,841
Listen to me.

815
00:59:01,841 --> 00:59:02,996
What's going on?

816
00:59:02,996 --> 00:59:03,942
There are four men.

817
00:59:03,942 --> 00:59:04,926
Yes, sir.

818
00:59:04,926 --> 00:59:05,961
They've killed a girl.

819
00:59:05,961 --> 00:59:07,075
They're playing some kind
of sick game.

820
00:59:07,075 --> 00:59:07,978
You need to contact the state
police now.

821
00:59:07,978 --> 00:59:08,927
Yes, sir.

822
00:59:08,927 --> 00:59:09,992
I need a weapon!

823
00:59:09,992 --> 00:59:10,939
All right, right around the back
there's an axe.

824
00:59:10,939 --> 00:59:11,892
You go grab it.

825
00:59:11,892 --> 00:59:12,880
I'm gonna go call it in
on the radio.

826
00:59:12,880 --> 00:59:13,869
You go.

827
00:59:13,869 --> 00:59:16,463
Honey, hurry up.

828
00:59:16,463 --> 00:59:17,818
Where is it?

829
00:59:21,278 --> 00:59:24,247
Where is it?

830
00:59:28,574 --> 00:59:29,885
Don!

831
00:59:41,135 --> 00:59:43,102
Oh, my God!

832
00:59:43,102 --> 00:59:44,620
Are you okay?

833
00:59:46,709 --> 00:59:48,480
I'm fine.

834
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:50,822
Let's take this truck.

835
00:59:50,822 --> 00:59:54,144
Okay.

836
00:59:56,149 --> 00:59:57,954
Careful!

837
01:00:03,418 --> 01:00:06,001
Don, hurry.

838
01:00:08,055 --> 01:00:09,942
Oh, my God!

839
01:00:09,942 --> 01:00:12,814
Run!

840
01:00:14,082 --> 01:00:15,891
This way!

841
01:00:21,723 --> 01:00:22,669
Fuckers!

842
01:00:22,669 --> 01:00:25,371
Oh my-- oh, my God!

843
01:00:27,468 --> 01:00:30,868
Don!

844
01:00:38,192 --> 01:00:41,581
There's a window!

845
01:00:41,581 --> 01:00:42,638
Get out the window.

846
01:00:42,638 --> 01:00:43,542
There's--

847
01:00:43,542 --> 01:00:44,683
Listen to me.

848
01:00:44,683 --> 01:00:46,846
If you make it to the car,
try to get the gun.

849
01:00:46,846 --> 01:00:48,073
Okay?

850
01:00:48,073 --> 01:00:49,093
I'll be right behind you.

851
01:00:49,093 --> 01:00:50,066
I will hold them off.

852
01:00:50,066 --> 01:00:51,136
Go!

853
01:00:51,136 --> 01:00:52,324
I can't go
without you, Don!

854
01:00:52,324 --> 01:00:53,548
Listen to me,
we're gonna make it.

855
01:00:53,548 --> 01:00:55,138
When you see someone,

856
01:00:55,138 --> 01:00:57,546
you start firing
and you don't stop.

857
01:00:57,546 --> 01:01:00,000
Go.

858
01:01:12,901 --> 01:01:14,988
All right, you mother-fucker!

859
01:01:21,024 --> 01:01:22,437
Goddamn it!

860
01:01:22,437 --> 01:01:23,763
We got to go in there and kill
that son of a bitch right now.

861
01:01:23,763 --> 01:01:25,642
He's gonna be a problem.

862
01:01:25,642 --> 01:01:27,519
Not yet.

863
01:01:27,519 --> 01:01:28,761
What do you mean,
not yet?

864
01:01:28,761 --> 01:01:32,344
He killed my cousin Cody,
you son of a bitch.

865
01:01:32,344 --> 01:01:34,011
I said not yet.

866
01:01:34,011 --> 01:01:37,425
Now, Carter,
you put that pistol away.

867
01:01:37,425 --> 01:01:39,321
Otherwise, one of us is gonna
die today.

868
01:01:41,290 --> 01:01:42,879
But which one?

869
01:01:42,879 --> 01:01:44,169
Now, why don't you give me
a chance?

870
01:01:44,169 --> 01:01:45,626
I bet you I could outdraw you.

871
01:01:47,498 --> 01:01:49,173
Don't get all tough
on me now.

872
01:01:52,293 --> 01:01:55,488
I like it when you do
the gladiator thing.

873
01:02:03,557 --> 01:02:05,676
Why don't we just get the show
back on the road?

874
01:02:05,676 --> 01:02:07,752
All right?

875
01:02:08,994 --> 01:02:09,944
All right.

876
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:26,312
Fuck!

877
01:02:28,645 --> 01:02:30,017
Find the gun, find the gun!

878
01:02:30,017 --> 01:02:31,057
There was a fucking gun.

879
01:02:32,510 --> 01:02:33,630
Ahh!

880
01:02:33,630 --> 01:02:36,574
Oh!

881
01:02:54,738 --> 01:02:56,004
Shit!

882
01:03:14,206 --> 01:03:16,577
Argh!

883
01:03:16,577 --> 01:03:19,084
You listen to me!

884
01:03:19,084 --> 01:03:22,730
Take me to my wife,
or I will fucking kill you!

885
01:03:39,269 --> 01:03:40,837
Easy now!

886
01:03:40,837 --> 01:03:45,125
You are one tough
son of a bitch.

887
01:03:45,125 --> 01:03:46,988
But I know you.

888
01:03:46,988 --> 01:03:50,676
You are not a real killer.

889
01:03:50,676 --> 01:03:53,608
I just work here.

890
01:03:53,608 --> 01:03:57,850
Where's my wife?

891
01:03:57,850 --> 01:04:00,819
You kill me and you ain't never
gonna find her!

892
01:04:00,819 --> 01:04:05,011
Just listen.

893
01:04:05,011 --> 01:04:06,629
Let's make a deal.

894
01:04:06,629 --> 01:04:10,191
I will help you and your wife
get out of here alive,

895
01:04:10,191 --> 01:04:14,515
but I need you to do
two things for me.

896
01:04:14,515 --> 01:04:17,950
One, let me walk out of here.

897
01:04:20,541 --> 01:04:22,828
And two?

898
01:04:22,828 --> 01:04:26,009
You go kill that son
of a bitch Cleveland first.

899
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:29,489
You shoot him right between
the fucking eyes.

900
01:04:29,489 --> 01:04:31,098
Agreed?

901
01:04:31,098 --> 01:04:33,096
I'm listening.

902
01:04:35,387 --> 01:04:37,115
Okay.

903
01:04:37,115 --> 01:04:39,816
Right behind you,
under that table,

904
01:04:39,816 --> 01:04:41,972
you're gonna find a pistol.

905
01:04:41,972 --> 01:04:44,509
It's fully loaded,
taped in place.

906
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:46,751
I'm ain't going nowhere.

907
01:04:57,730 --> 01:05:00,431
There.

908
01:05:00,431 --> 01:05:02,840
It's all good.

909
01:05:02,840 --> 01:05:06,768
We got a deal, right?

910
01:05:12,765 --> 01:05:15,464
I decided to change my mind.

911
01:05:15,464 --> 01:05:17,288
Stand up.

912
01:05:25,522 --> 01:05:28,183
Stop that whimpering.

913
01:05:28,183 --> 01:05:32,621
We're gonna walk out to my car
and if you run away,

914
01:05:32,621 --> 01:05:35,236
I shoot you down like a dog.

915
01:05:47,322 --> 01:05:48,585
Argh!

916
01:06:04,931 --> 01:06:09,109
Go, go, go, go!

917
01:06:51,206 --> 01:06:54,886
Whoo, we got ourselves
a gun fight!

918
01:06:56,871 --> 01:06:58,672
Hey, ya!

919
01:07:04,551 --> 01:07:06,176
Yee-ha!

920
01:07:09,265 --> 01:07:11,068
Run little doggie, run!

921
01:07:11,068 --> 01:07:12,055
Come on, you son of a bitch!

922
01:07:24,026 --> 01:07:25,481
I hope you run better
than you shoot!

923
01:07:59,023 --> 01:08:00,354
Ugh!

924
01:08:07,510 --> 01:08:10,857
Oh!

925
01:08:10,857 --> 01:08:13,007
My favorite part.

926
01:08:25,657 --> 01:08:27,588
Ah, you son of a bitch!

927
01:08:33,335 --> 01:08:35,939
Put that goddamn thing down,
you son of a bitch.

928
01:08:39,641 --> 01:08:41,528
Ugh!

929
01:09:43,430 --> 01:09:45,929
Carter!

930
01:09:45,929 --> 01:09:47,918
Carter.

931
01:09:50,244 --> 01:09:52,915
What's a matter, Cleveland?

932
01:09:52,915 --> 01:09:56,428
Don't want to play anymore?

933
01:09:56,428 --> 01:09:58,464
Help me.

934
01:09:58,464 --> 01:10:02,781
You know, I feel kind of
like an emperor.

935
01:10:02,781 --> 01:10:06,123
Should I give you the thumbs up,
or thumbs down?

936
01:10:08,406 --> 01:10:10,564
Goddamn, this ain't funny.

937
01:10:10,564 --> 01:10:12,598
Help me out.

938
01:10:14,438 --> 01:10:18,001
Come on.

939
01:10:18,001 --> 01:10:19,303
Goddamn it!

940
01:10:22,876 --> 01:10:24,133
And all I asked of you
is one goddamn thing,

941
01:10:24,133 --> 01:10:25,057
just stay organized.

942
01:10:25,057 --> 01:10:27,867
You just couldn't do it,
could you?

943
01:10:31,396 --> 01:10:33,031
These things cost.

944
01:10:33,031 --> 01:10:37,304
You're right about one thing.

945
01:10:37,304 --> 01:10:39,155
Somebody is gonna die tonight.

946
01:11:32,281 --> 01:11:34,333
To everything there is a season,

947
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,469
and a time to every purpose
under the heavens.

948
01:11:36,469 --> 01:11:40,646
A time to be born,
and a time to die.

949
01:11:40,646 --> 01:11:43,132
A time to plant,

950
01:11:43,132 --> 01:11:44,871
and a time to pluck up
that which is planted.

951
01:11:44,871 --> 01:11:47,793
A time to kill,

952
01:11:47,793 --> 01:11:49,966
and a time to heal.

953
01:11:49,966 --> 01:11:53,192
A time to break down,
and a time to build up.

954
01:11:53,192 --> 01:11:58,033
A time to weep,
and a time to laugh.

955
01:11:58,033 --> 01:11:59,554
A time to mourn

956
01:11:59,554 --> 01:12:04,258
as we say goodbye
to our dear friend, Sydney.

957
01:12:04,258 --> 01:12:08,400
We lament her loss yet we
rejoice in gaining the knowledge

958
01:12:08,400 --> 01:12:11,881
that she still continues
to look down upon us.

959
01:12:11,881 --> 01:12:14,885
Let's make Sydney proud.

960
01:12:14,885 --> 01:12:17,501
Go in peace.

961
01:12:17,501 --> 01:12:21,420
This funeral has ended.

962
01:12:36,930 --> 01:12:39,241
I'm so sorry for your loss.

963
01:12:39,241 --> 01:12:40,985
Thank you.

964
01:12:40,985 --> 01:12:42,160
Sydney was a friend of mine.

965
01:12:42,160 --> 01:12:45,031
Is there anything I can do?

966
01:12:45,031 --> 01:12:48,035
No, thank you.

967
01:12:48,035 --> 01:12:49,304
I can't think of anything.

968
01:12:49,304 --> 01:12:50,921
I have a place for you
to stay tonight

969
01:12:50,921 --> 01:12:53,918
if you don't want to take
the long drive home.

970
01:12:53,918 --> 01:12:57,056
Thank you, sir.

971
01:13:16,572 --> 01:13:19,448
We do have a code, you know.

972
01:13:19,448 --> 01:13:20,932
Code of silence.

973
01:13:23,019 --> 01:13:26,721
Yeah, I heard a rumor
from a little birdie

974
01:13:26,721 --> 01:13:28,734
that you've been running
your mouth

975
01:13:28,734 --> 01:13:32,079
about our organization.

976
01:13:32,079 --> 01:13:34,998
Well, I didn't figure you
were gonna level with me.

977
01:13:34,998 --> 01:13:37,484
Can't live by the code,
then you're gonna die by it.

978
01:13:48,810 --> 01:13:51,075
All right,
you take it easy there.
