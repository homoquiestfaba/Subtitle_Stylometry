Whoa!

38
00:03:17,122 --> 00:03:19,805
Gather 'round.
Class is in session.

39
00:03:21,320 --> 00:03:25,749
In the field, you must protect
your brain at all costs.

40
00:03:25,750 --> 00:03:27,229
We can repair any other damage,

41
00:03:27,230 --> 00:03:30,192
but it's not as though I'm
making back-up copies.

42
00:03:30,193 --> 00:03:33,822
One mind's all you have,
so be careful.

43
00:03:34,930 --> 00:03:38,699
Uptime. There's a limit to
how long your mind can run

44
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,809
on a cyber brain before you
must return to your body.

45
00:03:41,810 --> 00:03:45,374
If your neural image
changes too much, it will be

46
00:03:45,375 --> 00:03:48,939
incompatible with how you
left your human nervous system.

47
00:03:48,940 --> 00:03:51,223
You won't be able to download again.

48
00:03:56,786 --> 00:03:57,849
Overclocking.

49
00:03:57,850 --> 00:03:59,939
One of the many possible modifications

50
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:02,769
while running your
digitized mind, but beware.

51
00:04:02,770 --> 00:04:04,783
It simply consumes uptime faster.

52
00:04:14,230 --> 00:04:15,609
Body suits.

53
00:04:15,610 --> 00:04:19,159
Your bodies are immensely
strategically valuable.

54
00:04:19,160 --> 00:04:21,339
In addition to their gen:LOCK function,

55
00:04:21,340 --> 00:04:24,539
the body suits serve as intelligent armor,

56
00:04:24,540 --> 00:04:26,219
reading your nervous system's intent,

57
00:04:26,220 --> 00:04:28,401
and granting enhanced strength and speed.

58
00:04:29,236 --> 00:04:32,669
If you have to wear them all the time,
they may as well be useful.

59
00:04:32,670 --> 00:04:37,359
There's an always-on private
network between all uploaded minds.

60
00:04:37,360 --> 00:04:39,139
Think of it as telepathy.

61
00:04:39,140 --> 00:04:41,899
It will even allow you to
achieve gen:LOCK phase two,

62
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:47,630
where you can begin to share, well,
everything about your minds.

63
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,659
Aging out.
When the human brain reaches adulthood,

64
00:04:51,660 --> 00:04:54,509
it stops regenerating neurotransmitters.

65
00:04:54,510 --> 00:04:57,489
Gen:LOCK relies upon that
ability in a younger mind,

66
00:04:57,490 --> 00:04:59,864
hence you can age out of the program.

67
00:05:00,700 --> 00:05:01,809
Take Leon here.

68
00:05:01,810 --> 00:05:04,013
He was compatible, but
is just a bit too old.

69
00:05:04,014 --> 00:05:07,309
Hence there's too much risk
for him to join the program.

70
00:05:12,074 --> 00:05:15,720
<i>♪ And you know you will get

71
00:05:15,721 --> 00:05:17,898

75
00:05:43,017 --> 00:05:45,259
So all this time I've
been giving you space,

76
00:05:45,260 --> 00:05:48,149
I was also working on like
50 different opening lines.

77
00:05:48,150 --> 00:05:52,709
But then I realized all I really
wanted to do was say, "Hey."

78
00:05:52,710 --> 00:05:58,140
- So, hey.
- Hey.

79
00:05:59,390 --> 00:06:03,519
Damn. I didn't think about what
I wanted to say after "hey".

80
00:06:08,178 --> 00:06:11,359
So how do you think class is
going, sensei-chan?

81
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:12,244
Sensei-what?

82
00:06:12,245 --> 00:06:14,144
I don't know.
That's what Kazu calls you.

83
00:06:14,145 --> 00:06:15,439
Well, if your newbies don't get killed

84
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,610
on their first mission,
we'll call it a pass.

85
00:06:17,611 --> 00:06:19,264
Oh come on.
They're not that bad.

86
00:06:19,265 --> 00:06:20,919
Cammie's got
nerves around weapons.

87
00:06:20,920 --> 00:06:24,372
Kazu charges in alone.
Valentina always hangs back.

88
00:06:24,373 --> 00:06:26,309
They have raw talent as individuals,

89
00:06:26,310 --> 00:06:30,209
but refuse to trust or communicate,
so they fail as a fire team.

90
00:06:30,210 --> 00:06:31,979
They're going to get their
asses handed back to them

91
00:06:31,980 --> 00:06:33,539
in four-story-tall pieces.

92
00:06:33,540 --> 00:06:36,349
- Ooh, that's cold.
- It's how I see it.

93
00:06:36,350 --> 00:06:38,916
It's how Leon and Jodie see it.

94
00:06:39,053 --> 00:06:40,953
Yeah, okay.

95
00:06:42,000 --> 00:06:44,974
- Are we ever gonna talk about Jodie?
- Not if I can help it.

96
00:06:45,009 --> 00:06:46,760
- Miranda.
- What?

97
00:06:47,376 --> 00:06:49,446
Do you really want the details?

98
00:06:49,447 --> 00:06:52,839
It was years, Chase.
Years getting over you.

99
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,059
Then years trying to
finally get on with my life,

100
00:06:55,060 --> 00:06:56,919
but betraying everything by even trying.

101
00:06:56,920 --> 00:07:00,051
- And now what am I supposed to do?!
- Whoa. Hey, I don't know.

102
00:07:00,052 --> 00:07:03,173
Miranda... yes.

103
00:07:03,357 --> 00:07:06,020
- This is my fault.
- It isn't your...

104
00:07:06,310 --> 00:07:09,962
You did what you needed to do.
I don't blame you or anyone.

105
00:07:11,072 --> 00:07:15,526
For what it's worth,
it wasn't easy for me either.

106
00:07:15,527 --> 00:07:19,289
Ma and Dri, gone.

107
00:07:19,470 --> 00:07:21,189
Years of knowing you were out there,

108
00:07:21,190 --> 00:07:24,300
- but being told I couldn't reach out.
- When has that ever stopped you?

109
00:07:26,938 --> 00:07:28,489
It was because I'd be damned

110
00:07:28,490 --> 00:07:31,718
if I reached out and
then died on you twice.

111
00:07:31,930 --> 00:07:34,039
Nobody knew if I was going to make it.

112
00:07:34,040 --> 00:07:37,853
And I'm sorry, but I wasn't
going to put you through that again.

113
00:07:37,854 --> 00:07:39,554
You've seen the state I'm in.

114
00:07:40,530 --> 00:07:43,143
It's been a long road to
make peace with that,

115
00:07:43,144 --> 00:07:45,582
but I've made it.
I'm good.

116
00:07:45,583 --> 00:07:48,579
I'm here now.
All I can do is keep moving forward,

117
00:07:48,580 --> 00:07:51,118
and I'm not gonna watch
another chance go by.

118
00:07:51,119 --> 00:07:53,274
Do what you gotta do.

119
00:07:53,810 --> 00:07:58,934
But if you ever wanted
to try something again...

120
00:08:01,560 --> 00:08:05,984
- Well, you know where my tank is.
- I don't know.

121
00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:10,203
I don't know what to think anymore,
but maybe.

122
00:08:12,024 --> 00:08:15,636
Maybe you could try one of
those opening lines next time.

123
00:08:18,608 --> 00:08:20,255
Wonder if they'll ever sort it.

124
00:08:21,364 --> 00:08:22,949
Where did you come from?

125
00:08:22,950 --> 00:08:25,029
Just mixing from my Holon.
Chase does it all the time.

126
00:08:25,030 --> 00:08:26,291
Thought I'd give it a try.

127
00:08:26,292 --> 00:08:28,769
- What are you working on?
- Strider upkeep.

128
00:08:28,770 --> 00:08:30,799
They've been pushing them
hard to keep up with you guys.

129
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:32,584
They're pushing us just as hard.

130
00:08:32,585 --> 00:08:35,854
It doesn't help that I just cannae
seem to get comfy in me Holon.

131
00:08:35,889 --> 00:08:37,506
Something's off.

132
00:08:37,507 --> 00:08:39,505
- Off how?
- Hard to say.

133
00:08:39,510 --> 00:08:41,959
There's just something
about the way I'm wired.

134
00:08:41,960 --> 00:08:43,269
I just wanna be lower.

135
00:08:43,270 --> 00:08:46,559
It's like I'm having to run while wearing
the world's highest high heels.

136
00:08:46,560 --> 00:08:48,799
And with the way this
boxy armor throws me off,

137
00:08:48,800 --> 00:08:50,979
it's like I'm always
about to fall on me arse.

138
00:08:50,980 --> 00:08:54,229
Well, to fix that you'd have
to overhaul the endoskeleton itself.

139
00:08:54,230 --> 00:08:55,789
I mean, you'd literally have to rip

140
00:08:55,790 --> 00:08:58,098
those legs off and redo 'em.
Armor's easier.

141
00:08:58,099 --> 00:09:00,478
Just lay out your new patterns,
send it to the printers.

142
00:09:00,490 --> 00:09:01,527
Boom, done.

143
00:09:01,528 --> 00:09:04,379
- Wait, you can just do that?
- Yeah, check it.

144
00:09:04,380 --> 00:09:06,239
Vanguard designed
your armor for the ESU.

145
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:09,030
'Course, now the Colonel's got
my team covering maintenance

146
00:09:09,031 --> 00:09:11,820
for you guys, too. We use
those printers right over there.

147
00:09:13,621 --> 00:09:15,983
I could mod my kit?

148
00:09:15,984 --> 00:09:18,639
Not without authorization and, uh...

149
00:09:18,640 --> 00:09:22,509
not without this software that
I'm sending you right now.

150
00:09:22,510 --> 00:09:23,999
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you!

151
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:25,299
Don't mention it.

152
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,927
No but really, don't.
Like, you cannot tell anyone, okay?

153
00:09:27,928 --> 00:09:29,110
But check this out.

154
00:09:29,111 --> 00:09:33,461
See, Chase being all mopey lately
gave me some ideas.

155
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,232
- I've been working on something.
- Go on.

156
00:09:36,233 --> 00:09:40,287
He's just not right without these.

157
00:09:42,135 --> 00:09:46,057
I don't know if my legs have
been this tight my entire life.

158
00:09:46,058 --> 00:09:48,636
_

159
00:09:48,637 --> 00:09:50,337
I'm just saying it's harder.

160
00:09:54,597 --> 00:09:57,029
_

161
00:09:57,030 --> 00:09:59,239
- The commissary sells it.
- Nice!

162
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:02,233
- But not to you.
- I'm legal in Scotland.

163
00:10:02,234 --> 00:10:05,903
- If I order it with food.
- You're not in Scotland.

164
00:10:05,904 --> 00:10:10,227
_

165
00:10:10,228 --> 00:10:13,259
I'm with you, preferably
where there's dancing.

166
00:10:13,260 --> 00:10:15,789
You're out of luck.
We're not allowed off-base.

167
00:10:15,790 --> 00:10:17,650
What do they do for
fun around here then?

168
00:10:17,651 --> 00:10:20,129
The Ether, same as anywhere.

169
00:10:20,130 --> 00:10:22,200
You wanna game together?
Siege 2?

170
00:10:22,201 --> 00:10:23,150
<i> No!</i>

171
00:10:26,653 --> 00:10:29,099
You'd rather be bored
than hang out online?

172
00:10:29,100 --> 00:10:31,829
We spend all day, every day together.

173
00:10:31,830 --> 00:10:33,769
This is our first time off.

174
00:10:33,770 --> 00:10:36,209
You're the last people
I want to see right now.

175
00:10:36,210 --> 00:10:38,579
But we're supposed to be
working on team building, right?

176
00:10:38,580 --> 00:10:40,469
So let's go game together or something,

177
00:10:40,470 --> 00:10:43,333
improve the communication
or some shite.

178
00:10:44,010 --> 00:10:45,710
Come on!

179
00:10:46,589 --> 00:10:48,345
Alright.

180
00:10:48,346 --> 00:10:49,322
Whoo!

181
00:11:11,174 --> 00:11:13,642
<i>♪ Years of compression ♪</i>

182
00:11:13,643 --> 00:11:16,339
<i>♪ The years they come and go ♪</i>

183
00:11:16,340 --> 00:11:19,019
<i>♪ It's all subjective ♪</i>

184
00:11:19,020 --> 00:11:21,330
<i>♪ Worn boots and told you so's ♪</i>

185
00:11:21,331 --> 00:11:23,995
Do I have to do everything?

186
00:11:23,996 --> 00:11:25,506
<i>♪ Sews despair in to diamond rings ♪</i>

187
00:11:25,507 --> 00:11:27,854
<i>♪ Burning everything as far
as the eyes can see ♪</i>

188
00:11:27,905 --> 00:11:30,293
Kazu, do you really
need to look tougher?

189
00:11:31,810 --> 00:11:35,239
You have a hijab?
In here, but not out there?

190
00:11:35,240 --> 00:11:37,609
- Is it so unusual?
- No, not at all.

191
00:11:37,610 --> 00:11:39,889
It's just weird seeing you with long hair.

192
00:11:39,890 --> 00:11:43,730
I think she looks lovely.
Did you used to wear it this way?

193
00:11:44,963 --> 00:11:47,253
Oh, you look smashing.

194
00:11:47,254 --> 00:11:48,199
_

195
00:11:48,200 --> 00:11:51,533
I have to admit, it may
be time to use Val again.

196
00:11:51,534 --> 00:11:53,391
_

197
00:11:53,392 --> 00:11:55,248
__

198
00:11:55,249 --> 00:11:57,459
No.
Well, yes.

199
00:11:57,460 --> 00:12:00,499
I will now, but it's not role-playing.

200
00:12:00,500 --> 00:12:03,539
Kazu, do you not know, pal?
Oh, sorry, Val.

201
00:12:03,540 --> 00:12:05,024
You should say it.
It's not my place.

202
00:12:05,025 --> 00:12:10,749
Nyet, it's perfectly fine.
My body is physically female at present,

203
00:12:10,750 --> 00:12:15,138
but I'm starting to think,
maybe soon ... a change?

204
00:12:15,139 --> 00:12:16,392
_

205
00:12:16,393 --> 00:12:18,093
Think genderfluid.

206
00:12:18,094 --> 00:12:19,069
_

207
00:12:19,070 --> 00:12:21,843
- You've shifted before?
- A few times now.

208
00:12:21,844 --> 00:12:23,339
_

209
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:26,990
Sometimes, not now.
Perhaps again soon.

210
00:12:27,025 --> 00:12:28,699
I sense the pressure coming on again

211
00:12:28,700 --> 00:12:31,565
in a way I haven't in a long time.

212
00:12:32,134 --> 00:12:35,319
_

213
00:12:35,320 --> 00:12:37,623
You'll never know.

214
00:12:37,624 --> 00:12:40,374
What is taking Chase so long?

215
00:12:43,790 --> 00:12:44,640
Really?

216
00:12:44,641 --> 00:12:47,259
You can make yourself look
like anything you imagine,

217
00:12:47,260 --> 00:12:48,780
and you go with a hoodie.

218
00:12:48,781 --> 00:12:51,315
What can I say?
I gotta be me.

219
00:12:51,670 --> 00:12:55,239
- Are we gaming or what?
- Aye. We got several options you may fancy.

220
00:12:55,240 --> 00:12:56,940
We could go sci-fi.

221
00:12:58,350 --> 00:13:01,353
Are you joking?
We do this all day long.

222
00:13:02,370 --> 00:13:03,689
Pirates?

223
00:13:03,690 --> 00:13:06,673
Anyone wanna sail the high
seas looking for booty?

224
00:13:08,170 --> 00:13:11,430
Fantasy warriors.
Could go monster hunting.

225
00:13:12,410 --> 00:13:14,961
Come on!
Somebody pick something.

226
00:13:14,962 --> 00:13:19,216
_

227
00:13:20,464 --> 00:13:25,294
Uh ... I have a sudden
desire to hit the club.

228
00:13:26,493 --> 00:13:29,046
You dafties.
Yaz?

229
00:13:29,047 --> 00:13:32,500
I may retire.
Perhaps another time.

230
00:13:33,347 --> 00:13:36,379
- You got me.
- I guess.

231
00:13:36,380 --> 00:13:40,360
- Hey, what am I not g...
- Huh?

232
00:13:45,432 --> 00:13:48,345
What was that?
Has the Vanguard not paid its Ether bill?

233
00:13:48,346 --> 00:13:51,693
<i> Interceptors, ready
one and ready two. Scramble.</i>

234
00:13:51,694 --> 00:13:54,687
<i>Alert teams
Baker, Charlie, and gen:LOCK One.</i>

235
00:13:54,688 --> 00:13:55,295
<i>Report to North Mech Hangar...</i>

236
00:13:55,296 --> 00:13:57,686

- ...for immediate load up.

237
00:13:57,721 --> 00:14:01,951
- Oh hell.
- Come on! It's showtime.

238
00:14:02,920 --> 00:14:04,989
We'll be dropping
you in ten clicks north

239
00:14:04,990 --> 00:14:06,179
of the Dallas Data Center.

240
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:08,961
They're trying to bring down the Ether?
You can do that?

241
00:14:08,962 --> 00:14:11,139
It appears the Union is attacking one

242
00:14:11,140 --> 00:14:14,056
of the main distribution
nodes for the entire network.

243
00:14:14,057 --> 00:14:16,706
The area was evacuated
when the attack began,

244
00:14:16,710 --> 00:14:18,769
and since then, there's
been too much interference

245
00:14:18,770 --> 00:14:21,089
to get a good read
on the Union forces.

246
00:14:21,090 --> 00:14:23,490
We're not exactly sure
what you're heading into.

247
00:14:23,491 --> 00:14:24,489
_

248
00:14:24,490 --> 00:14:27,285
If it taps into the data center,
aren't we fucked already?

249
00:14:27,286 --> 00:14:29,822
Cammie, we have got
to work on your cursing!

250
00:14:29,823 --> 00:14:32,988
Why?
I curse pretty well already.

251
00:14:33,937 --> 00:14:35,474
Fine.

252
00:14:35,475 --> 00:14:37,377
Effed.
Aren't already effed?

253
00:14:37,378 --> 00:14:39,621
- We're not sure.
- Eh?

254
00:14:39,630 --> 00:14:43,599
This isn't our...
The Union's normal attack pattern.

255
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:46,339
Exactly.
The Union are like an infection.

256
00:14:46,340 --> 00:14:48,429
They creep.
They expand.

257
00:14:48,430 --> 00:14:51,779
This data center is hundreds
of miles from Union territory.

258
00:14:51,780 --> 00:14:53,359
We've never seen them extend their reach

259
00:14:53,360 --> 00:14:56,552
- this far in one go since...
- New York.

260
00:14:58,330 --> 00:15:02,374
Their usual MO  is to edge into
the next area and shove the Polity

261
00:15:02,375 --> 00:15:05,509
and its sympathizers out
with a minimum of collateral damage.

262
00:15:05,510 --> 00:15:07,519
They want the infrastructure intact.

263
00:15:07,520 --> 00:15:10,523
Maybe they've finally
decided to cripple the Ether.

264
00:15:10,524 --> 00:15:12,219
_

265
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,611
__

266
00:15:15,612 --> 00:15:17,349
Do you even listen?

267
00:15:17,350 --> 00:15:19,829
_

268
00:15:19,830 --> 00:15:23,739
Insufficient uptime to cover
both travel and the mission itself.

269
00:15:23,740 --> 00:15:26,073
This is how you'll usually deploy.
We fly you in.

270
00:15:26,074 --> 00:15:28,419
You upload, go take care of
business, then you download

271
00:15:28,420 --> 00:15:31,019
back into your human bodies,
quickly as possible.

272
00:15:31,020 --> 00:15:31,853
You fly home.

273
00:15:31,854 --> 00:15:35,079
At the risk of bringing our
bodies closer to the action.

274
00:15:35,080 --> 00:15:37,063
Can you tell how thrilled I am about that?

275
00:15:37,064 --> 00:15:40,411
_

276
00:15:40,412 --> 00:15:42,770
Uhh, now.

277
00:15:53,585 --> 00:15:56,427
Get your arse out of my face.

278
00:15:56,428 --> 00:15:59,605
_

279
00:16:01,776 --> 00:16:02,584
Prepare to drop.

280
00:16:02,585 --> 00:16:04,944
- We're coming in hot.
- How hot?

281
00:16:34,975 --> 00:16:39,140
Let's jam!

282
00:16:39,141 --> 00:16:42,155
Phew.

283
00:17:10,091 --> 00:17:12,329
All right, Yaz.
First area's clear.

284
00:17:12,330 --> 00:17:15,190
Turn on your camo.
We are moving up to Chase.

285
00:17:16,311 --> 00:17:18,395
Ready to advance.
I'll cover.

286
00:17:18,430 --> 00:17:20,718
Okay, go.

287
00:17:24,305 --> 00:17:27,332
H-Hey.
See that?

288
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:29,171
I'm shooting less friends.

289
00:18:05,110 --> 00:18:07,675
Huh?

290
00:18:17,463 --> 00:18:18,789
All right, grunts hang back.

291
00:18:18,790 --> 00:18:20,923
Striders, move up and we'll keep up the...

292
00:18:36,870 --> 00:18:38,582
Kazu, we have got

293
00:18:38,583 --> 00:18:41,000
to talk about collateral damage.

294
00:18:41,727 --> 00:18:43,896
- All clear over here.
- Okay.

295
00:18:43,897 --> 00:18:45,446
Everyone head for the main building.

296
00:18:45,447 --> 00:18:48,517
This is really weird.
There should be more resistance.

297
00:18:51,170 --> 00:18:54,770
No life signs in the building.
Send in the clowns.

298
00:18:59,980 --> 00:19:02,411
Negative contact.
No life, no ordinance.

299
00:19:02,412 --> 00:19:05,719
- Command?
- Take it.

300
00:19:05,720 --> 00:19:08,403
- You heard her. Two by two, grunts.
- Moving in.

301
00:19:08,404 --> 00:19:10,899
All right.
Striders secure inner perimeter.

302
00:19:10,900 --> 00:19:13,699
- Holons patrol the outfield.
- Do what now?

303
00:19:13,700 --> 00:19:16,449
Hang back, split up,
and keep your eyes open.

304
00:19:31,150 --> 00:19:32,211
Hm?

305
00:19:32,212 --> 00:19:36,051
Hey, look at me!
Still not shooting anybody I know.

306
00:19:36,562 --> 00:19:38,262
Kazu, you get big?

307
00:19:38,263 --> 00:19:40,749
_

308
00:19:40,750 --> 00:19:43,398
Who's in front of me?
Your camo's gone weird.

309
00:19:45,920 --> 00:19:47,439
Cammie, open fire.

310
00:19:47,440 --> 00:19:49,469
Oh, you want me to
shoot each other now, is it?

311
00:19:49,470 --> 00:19:51,577
- Make up your...
- Cammie! Shoot the damn gun!

312
00:20:10,560 --> 00:20:12,260
Chase, get her out of there.

313
00:20:15,150 --> 00:20:18,490
Do I just walk through?
Guys?

314
00:20:31,511 --> 00:20:33,211
- Doc?
- Do it.

315
00:20:51,981 --> 00:20:53,681
Cammie!

316
00:20:59,670 --> 00:21:03,338
- Oh crap.
- We got smoke. Everybody seal up.

317
00:22:42,357 --> 00:22:45,811
What happened?
Are you all right?

318
00:22:50,989 --> 00:22:52,538
Cammie, listen to me.

319
00:22:52,539 --> 00:22:54,941
I've opened a port to my optical sensors.

320
00:22:54,942 --> 00:22:56,759
I'm sharing my eyes with you.

321
00:22:56,760 --> 00:23:00,639
- Cammie?
- I-I can see!

322
00:23:00,640 --> 00:23:03,125
Me?
I've got no head!

323
00:23:03,126 --> 00:23:05,819
It worked!
Mindshare worked.

324
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:07,789
Wait, you've
never done this before?

325
00:23:07,790 --> 00:23:09,749
Not with Chase?

326
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,639
<i>Anvil Command.
Data Center secure.</i>

327
00:23:11,640 --> 00:23:13,609
<i>Last bogie seems to have moved off.</i>

328
00:23:13,610 --> 00:23:15,349
Re-establish the perimeter.

329
00:23:15,350 --> 00:23:18,589
Breakers, get the data
center operational again.

330
00:23:18,590 --> 00:23:22,170
Cammie's mind is still racing.
She's burning through her uptime.

331
00:23:23,230 --> 00:23:25,179
Secure Holons on the transports.

332
00:23:25,180 --> 00:23:28,637
Gen:LOCK One, prepare for download.

333
00:23:28,638 --> 00:23:30,564
- You got this?
- Yeah, we're good.

334
00:23:30,565 --> 00:23:32,076
Go take care of her.

335
00:23:32,077 --> 00:23:35,143
What the hell was that anyhow?
