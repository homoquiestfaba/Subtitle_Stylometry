1
00:00:13,840 --> 00:00:16,491
You know what my first memory is?

2
00:00:16,640 --> 00:00:18,722
Feeling special.

3
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,724
The first time I pooped,
there was applause.

4
00:00:21,880 --> 00:00:25,851
When we scribbled something in crayon,
it was a Picasso.

5
00:00:26,040 --> 00:00:28,042
Gold stickers for everyone.

6
00:00:28,880 --> 00:00:33,442
C+ in gym? Perfect attendance?
"Hey, here's 100 bucks."

7
00:00:33,600 --> 00:00:35,762
When we hit a new level on Wave Race,

8
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:38,321
it was like we won the Olympics.

9
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:41,768
For kids of my generation,
strike three meant one thing:

10
00:00:43,920 --> 00:00:45,604
take your base.

11
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:48,366
Look out, world. Here we come.

12
00:00:52,520 --> 00:00:55,205
Closer, closer, closer. There we go.

13
00:00:56,600 --> 00:00:59,763
- Look at that.
- You are so cute together.

14
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,127
Adorable. So, Jillian,

15
00:01:02,280 --> 00:01:05,363
Will tells us that you are going to
start working at Johnson & Johnson.

16
00:01:05,520 --> 00:01:08,888
- That's fantastic!
- Thank you. Yeah, I'm excited to start.

17
00:01:09,040 --> 00:01:11,122
Sales Analyst. It sounds so impressive.

18
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:14,807
Junior Sales Analyst. But the "Junior"
is gonna be gone by Christmas.

19
00:01:15,800 --> 00:01:18,326
And Will's finally being paid
at LA Weekly.

20
00:01:18,480 --> 00:01:19,891
- Way to go, you two.
- I know.

21
00:01:20,040 --> 00:01:22,042
I told you guys, we're a power couple.

22
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:25,361
Will, there's a little something
to get you started.

23
00:01:30,200 --> 00:01:31,804
Wow!

24
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,689
Thanks, Dad. Thanks, Mom.

25
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:37,731
Will, did I ever tell you
what my first job was?

26
00:01:37,880 --> 00:01:40,167
Was it, by any chance, stacking crates
of tomatoes in a warehouse, Dad?

27
00:01:40,320 --> 00:01:41,560
Correct.

28
00:01:41,720 --> 00:01:44,485
Must have been 100 degrees
in that warehouse.

29
00:01:44,640 --> 00:01:46,642
- You know what got me through?
- I'm gonna go with air conditioning.

30
00:01:46,800 --> 00:01:48,848
Air conditioning.

31
00:01:49,040 --> 00:01:51,281
There was one office
that was air conditioned.

32
00:01:51,440 --> 00:01:53,010
High above the floor.

33
00:01:53,160 --> 00:01:55,640
It was for the warehouse supervisor.

34
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:58,081
And I told myself right then and there,

35
00:01:58,240 --> 00:02:01,767
"I don't know how I'm gonna do it,
but I'm going to get to that office."

36
00:02:01,920 --> 00:02:04,241
Didn't that guy have a heart attack, Dad?

37
00:02:05,040 --> 00:02:08,647
It was an aneurysm.
The point is, I worked my way up

38
00:02:08,800 --> 00:02:12,202
until I was in charge of the entire
North American supply chain.

39
00:02:12,400 --> 00:02:15,006
I am proof there's nothing
you can't achieve.

40
00:02:15,160 --> 00:02:17,640
Exactly, and that's why
I'm saying this LA Weekly thing

41
00:02:17,800 --> 00:02:19,404
is really just a springboard for me.

42
00:02:19,560 --> 00:02:21,164
'Cause, I mean, I'm gonna dominate
their Web edition.

43
00:02:21,320 --> 00:02:24,085
I've got videos, live blogging,
interactive content.

44
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:27,642
- I'm building my brand.
- Brand?

45
00:02:36,320 --> 00:02:38,084
- You spent the money on a TV?
- Yeah.

46
00:02:38,240 --> 00:02:40,288
That's one of the largest televisions
available on the market today.

47
00:02:40,440 --> 00:02:42,761
Seventy inches. What?

48
00:02:43,800 --> 00:02:46,007
You want to know why
we're not living together? Exhibit A.

49
00:02:46,960 --> 00:02:49,531
Hey, J. La.
Was that your sister at graduation?

50
00:02:49,680 --> 00:02:51,250
- No.
- Are you sure?

51
00:02:52,600 --> 00:02:55,331
I saw her, like, hugging your parents
and giving your dad a little...

52
00:02:55,480 --> 00:02:57,084
I mean, can I get her phone number?

53
00:02:57,280 --> 00:03:00,250
- Is this the iStalkU?
- It's the iSearchU.

54
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:03,165
- If you could just mind your business.
- What is iStalkU?

55
00:03:03,320 --> 00:03:04,924
The iSearchU?

56
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:07,248
It's just an app that I'm developing.

57
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:10,006
Say there's a person that you want to
find, but they don't want to be found.

58
00:03:10,160 --> 00:03:12,731
Like, there's this girl,
and you've called her a million times,

59
00:03:12,920 --> 00:03:14,524
and she just won't return your messages.

60
00:03:14,680 --> 00:03:17,331
My app allows you to send them
a text message and...

61
00:03:18,760 --> 00:03:20,603
receive back their exact location.

62
00:03:20,800 --> 00:03:25,044
So there's nowhere to hide,
Jillian's sister. Nowhere.

63
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,043
No, you cannot have her number.

64
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,089
I'll find your sister.

65
00:03:29,240 --> 00:03:31,129
You're gonna end up in iJail
getting iRaped.

66
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:34,170
And I'm gonna handle the iStock IPO!

67
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:37,850
Yeah, yeah, yeah!

68
00:03:38,000 --> 00:03:40,321
- You don't even have a job.
- I got a business degree.

69
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:42,801
Unlike Broke Nuts over here,
I have marketable skills.

70
00:03:42,960 --> 00:03:45,042
Unlike you, Broke Nuts has a job.

71
00:03:45,240 --> 00:03:47,846
I have nine interviews this week.

72
00:03:50,040 --> 00:03:52,611
Today, it's Morgan Stanley...

73
00:03:54,320 --> 00:03:55,810
and Great Pacific.

74
00:03:56,840 --> 00:03:59,047
I love you all. Get your lives together.

75
00:03:59,200 --> 00:04:00,690
- Good luck, dude.
- Good luck.

76
00:04:00,880 --> 00:04:05,010
Excuse me, ma'am.
Would you like to be my guest?

77
00:04:05,160 --> 00:04:08,084
Hi, have we met? I'm Jillian.

78
00:04:08,240 --> 00:04:11,050
- God.
- Stop booing me, Charlie.

79
00:04:11,200 --> 00:04:13,202
Just one time. Just smoke with me.

80
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:15,169
Make an exception. We're celebrating.

81
00:04:15,320 --> 00:04:19,644
- Charlie got a job today.
- McDonald's or Taco Bell?

82
00:04:22,680 --> 00:04:24,921
Middle school chemistry teacher.

83
00:04:27,680 --> 00:04:30,206
I weep for our future.

84
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:48,283
Fuck me in the ass! Fuck me!

85
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,285
Hey, Brian.

86
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,926
Hey, Will. Looking good, buddy.

87
00:05:00,320 --> 00:05:02,641
We don't have a job for you.

88
00:05:03,640 --> 00:05:06,405
- What do you mean?
- I mean, we don't have a job for you.

89
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:07,641
We've downsized.

90
00:05:09,480 --> 00:05:10,970
Yeah, but I'm perfect for this job.

91
00:05:11,160 --> 00:05:13,891
I'm sorry, Will. Thank you very much.

92
00:05:15,040 --> 00:05:17,281
Look, Brian, I got three Webisodes
all ready to upload...

93
00:05:17,440 --> 00:05:19,761
"Where to Find the Best Beef Machaca,"
"How to Bike the LA River,"

94
00:05:19,960 --> 00:05:22,201
and "Why Ultimate Frisbee
is More Complex Than Chess."

95
00:05:22,360 --> 00:05:25,125
You're not alone.
I had to let eight people go last week.

96
00:05:27,480 --> 00:05:28,527
Why didn't you tell me?

97
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:33,322
Honestly, with everything going on
around here, I just forgot.

98
00:05:33,520 --> 00:05:34,806
Good.

99
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:41,287
You forgot? I spent two summers
interning here for free

100
00:05:41,480 --> 00:05:44,882
so that I could have a job waiting
for me after graduation, and you forgot.

101
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,690
Look, I've already told everybody
about this job.

102
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:50,208
I told my friends and my family and my
parents about this job, and you forgot!

103
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:52,681
Well, guess what, Brian?
You can't do this kind of shit, man!

104
00:05:52,840 --> 00:05:54,808
I deserve to be treated
a little better than this.

105
00:05:55,000 --> 00:05:57,890
And I think you owe me
a little more than "I forgot."

106
00:06:08,920 --> 00:06:10,331
I don't owe you shit.

107
00:06:13,400 --> 00:06:16,802
"Systems administrator"? No.

108
00:06:16,960 --> 00:06:18,564
"Nuclear pipe technician"?

109
00:06:18,720 --> 00:06:20,848
No, you haven't laid that much pipe, so...

110
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:23,207
I've laid a lot of pipe, Charles.
Ask your mother.

111
00:06:23,400 --> 00:06:24,845
Sick burn.

112
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:29,003
- "Unemployment benefits administrator."
- Yeah, dude, that one.

113
00:06:29,200 --> 00:06:31,009
That'd be ironic.

114
00:06:31,200 --> 00:06:33,407
It's not ironic if it's all the time.

115
00:06:33,560 --> 00:06:35,688
You know what's all the time?
Ball taps and kills.

116
00:06:35,840 --> 00:06:38,844
Dude, don't play dirty, man.
Don't play dirty.

117
00:06:39,040 --> 00:06:41,008
Oh, shit.

118
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:44,164
Dude, I honestly have no idea
what any of this shit means.

119
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:47,005
Well, you better figure it out soon.
The rent is due Friday.

120
00:06:47,160 --> 00:06:50,881
I know. I just need something to keep
the lights on until I find my dream job.

121
00:06:51,040 --> 00:06:53,884
I don't think you can
monetize masturbation.

122
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:56,650
It was too good.

123
00:06:57,640 --> 00:07:00,246
Oh, here's something
in the hospitality industry.

124
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:03,607
You don't have any sort of medical degree.

125
00:07:13,760 --> 00:07:17,367
Okay, there's a gun in the drawer,
but you probably won't need it.

126
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:19,409
All right. Good night, kid.

127
00:07:23,440 --> 00:07:26,808
There are Negroes on this boat!

128
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,689
I'm sorry to hear that.

129
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:34,002
You the new guy?

130
00:07:34,160 --> 00:07:36,049
- Yeah, I am new.
- Skeezy D.

131
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:38,326
Will.

132
00:07:41,160 --> 00:07:43,640
Three rooms. Keep the change.

133
00:07:44,680 --> 00:07:47,001
Girl, you better treat this man right.

134
00:07:47,160 --> 00:07:48,730
He was in Vietnam.

135
00:07:48,880 --> 00:07:50,325
Korea.

136
00:07:50,480 --> 00:07:52,687
Get in there and bust a nut,
Hawkeye Pierce!

137
00:07:53,760 --> 00:07:58,084
Hell, Cheryl's one of my best girls.

138
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:01,289
- Hard worker?
- That pussy comes correct.

139
00:08:02,320 --> 00:08:05,164
- Where'd you meet her?
- Met her at my last gig.

140
00:08:05,320 --> 00:08:08,847
- Which... where was that?
- Borders.

141
00:08:11,360 --> 00:08:13,169
Borders... Borders bookstore?

142
00:08:13,320 --> 00:08:15,800
Listen, man, shit went sideways, okay?

143
00:08:15,960 --> 00:08:18,691
Everybody was out of work.
I had to get out of there real quick.

144
00:08:18,840 --> 00:08:21,127
So, why "Skeezy D"?

145
00:08:24,440 --> 00:08:28,650
Men who hire prostitutes
aren't paying them for sex, Will.

146
00:08:28,800 --> 00:08:32,361
They're paying for danger.

147
00:08:32,520 --> 00:08:35,330
They're paying to feel alive.

148
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,961
Hey, motherfucker,
you better pay my bitch what you owe.

149
00:08:43,680 --> 00:08:47,571
They're paying
for a certain joie de vivre.

150
00:08:50,120 --> 00:08:51,406
That's French.

151
00:09:12,360 --> 00:09:14,647
I'm not resisting arrest.
Okay, I'm not resisting arrest.

152
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:17,326
Okay, I'm not resisting arrest. I'm not.

153
00:09:17,480 --> 00:09:19,164
I'm not. I'm not.

154
00:09:19,320 --> 00:09:21,129
Hey, bitch, we had a deal!

155
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,408
You were renting out rooms to hookers?

156
00:09:23,560 --> 00:09:25,130
- Skeezy said they're here every...
- No, no.

157
00:09:25,280 --> 00:09:27,123
That's not the kind of establishment
I'm running here.

158
00:09:27,280 --> 00:09:29,442
Read the sign there, kid.
It says "No prostitution."

159
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:32,126
That clearly includes hookers.

160
00:09:32,280 --> 00:09:34,521
You're fired.

161
00:09:34,680 --> 00:09:38,366
I'm sorry, Officer. I just got to be
a little more careful about who I hire.

162
00:09:38,520 --> 00:09:40,522
- You do that.
- Yeah. Will do. Will do.

163
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:43,087
Thanks for everything you do, Officer.

164
00:09:45,000 --> 00:09:46,365
Sorry, kid.

165
00:09:46,560 --> 00:09:48,688
Shit rolls downhill.
You know what I'm saying?

166
00:09:48,840 --> 00:09:52,367
You get it. You get it.
You'll be all right.

167
00:09:53,480 --> 00:09:55,482
Son of a bitch!

168
00:09:59,440 --> 00:10:01,044
Hey, Dad?

169
00:10:02,120 --> 00:10:03,963
I gotta ask you for money.

170
00:10:04,920 --> 00:10:07,082
Will, you're a grown-up now.

171
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:09,322
I'm not gonna give you any more money.

172
00:10:09,480 --> 00:10:11,084
Dad, what am I supposed to do?

173
00:10:11,240 --> 00:10:13,607
You want me to go
sell my body on the street?

174
00:10:13,800 --> 00:10:16,531
Enough of the life lessons here, man.
I am broke.

175
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:19,530
- I literally have no money for anything.
- I lost my job.

176
00:10:23,080 --> 00:10:24,366
Are you serious?

177
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:27,244
Afraid so.

178
00:10:29,280 --> 00:10:31,442
Well, what happened?

179
00:10:32,920 --> 00:10:36,811
Apparently, I was so successful
at streamlining the beverage supply chain

180
00:10:36,960 --> 00:10:39,361
that I made my own job obsolete.

181
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:44,284
So, what are you gonna do?

182
00:10:44,440 --> 00:10:46,488
I'm going to get a job!

183
00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:49,689
I'm gonna follow my ABC's, stay positive,

184
00:10:49,840 --> 00:10:52,207
and in the interim, look!

185
00:10:52,360 --> 00:10:54,966
I can tackle all the chores
I never had time for.

186
00:11:08,360 --> 00:11:10,362
You guys gotta get your lives together.

187
00:11:11,480 --> 00:11:14,086
Top 1 %, here I come, baby!

188
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,762
Hey, this guy got a job.

189
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,367
It's called Top Deck Securities.
I start clerking next month.

190
00:11:21,520 --> 00:11:24,410
If I kick ass,
I'll be making trades by December.

191
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,121
From this point on, it's gonna be
coffee and cocaine for me, baby.

192
00:11:28,280 --> 00:11:30,282
Do you take change for dollars?

193
00:11:30,440 --> 00:11:32,169
No, no. Keep it. You worked hard.

194
00:11:32,320 --> 00:11:34,322
You've got an incredible amount of torque.

195
00:11:37,640 --> 00:11:39,642
You deserve so much more money than this,

196
00:11:39,840 --> 00:11:42,525
but I'm on a teacher's salary.

197
00:11:46,040 --> 00:11:48,327
If you want to see the show,
you gotta pay for it.

198
00:11:48,520 --> 00:11:51,410
No, I'm just here for the free buffet.

199
00:11:51,600 --> 00:11:55,002
The buffet is free 'cause you're supposed
to be spending money on me.

200
00:11:56,560 --> 00:11:59,006
I guess I found a loophole.

201
00:11:59,160 --> 00:12:02,687
- Your friend's got an attitude.
- He's out of work.

202
00:12:02,840 --> 00:12:05,320
So buy him a lap dance to cheer him up.

203
00:12:11,800 --> 00:12:14,201
- Yeah.
- I'd like to get to know you sometime.

204
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:16,681
- Don't get her pregnant.
- Oh, hey, look.

205
00:12:16,880 --> 00:12:18,530
- I have a girlfriend.
- Yo, Will!

206
00:12:21,840 --> 00:12:24,764
- So, you're looking for a job?
- Yeah.

207
00:12:24,920 --> 00:12:29,084
What would you do if you won the lottery
and never had to work again?

208
00:12:29,240 --> 00:12:31,720
- I don't know.
- What's your passion?

209
00:12:33,040 --> 00:12:35,566
What do you love to do?

210
00:12:35,720 --> 00:12:38,166
I like to make funny YouTube videos.

211
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:40,044
Oh, if you like making YouTube videos,

212
00:12:40,200 --> 00:12:42,407
why aren't you looking
for corporate video work?

213
00:12:42,560 --> 00:12:45,643
Corporate? Yeah, I don't do corporate.

214
00:12:45,800 --> 00:12:47,882
Listen, babe.

215
00:12:48,040 --> 00:12:52,807
When you're first starting out,
you gotta stay flexible.

216
00:13:00,840 --> 00:13:02,888
- Do you know what we do here, Hamilton?
- Trade stocks.

217
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,202
Wrong. We make money.

218
00:13:05,360 --> 00:13:09,490
This is Hamilton. He is clerking for us.

219
00:13:09,680 --> 00:13:11,808
I had to shit-can that other douchebag

220
00:13:11,960 --> 00:13:14,725
because, well, I couldn't stand
looking at his face anymore.

221
00:13:14,880 --> 00:13:18,680
- Put all your orders in through him.
- Wait, I get to put in orders?

222
00:13:18,840 --> 00:13:22,083
- More than you can imagine.
- Hell, yeah.

223
00:13:22,280 --> 00:13:24,282
Go across the street,
get me three triple espressos.

224
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:26,442
Put three sugars in each one.
None of that Splenda shit.

225
00:13:26,600 --> 00:13:28,409
- I want the real thing.
- Go to Fatburger.

226
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:30,449
Get me 12 double XLs with extra cheese,

227
00:13:30,600 --> 00:13:32,921
12 chili-cheese fat fries,
nine milk shakes.

228
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:35,851
Hey, go to 7-Eleven. Pick me up
25 Black Cherry lottery tickets.

229
00:13:36,040 --> 00:13:38,361
Fifteen grand top prize.
You scratch them off.

230
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,170
Start from the bottom. Odd numbers first.

231
00:13:40,320 --> 00:13:44,484
- Go! Go, go, go...
- Still here? Still here?

232
00:13:45,480 --> 00:13:47,448
And I better fucking win!

233
00:13:50,520 --> 00:13:52,020
What are you doing?

234
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,567
- I need a sexy video of you.
- Yeah, I don't think so.

235
00:13:55,720 --> 00:13:58,883
I made an appointment
to donate sperm. What?

236
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:02,362
Your best idea for making rent
is masturbating into a cup?

237
00:14:02,520 --> 00:14:04,568
I'm an accomplished masturbator.

238
00:14:05,800 --> 00:14:07,802
Will, I don't know
what's going on with you.

239
00:14:07,960 --> 00:14:10,281
At school, you always had
a million different things going on.

240
00:14:10,440 --> 00:14:12,761
Your energy was contagious.
It's what I loved about you.

241
00:14:12,920 --> 00:14:17,403
And right now, it feels like you're just
flailing around, making it up as you go.

242
00:14:17,560 --> 00:14:19,927
I saw a job counselor last week.

243
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:23,090
Really? A job counselor?

244
00:14:23,240 --> 00:14:27,245
And she was all over me about
forming a strategy, and just really...

245
00:14:27,400 --> 00:14:29,243
She rode me to stay flexible,

246
00:14:29,400 --> 00:14:32,290
and so we decided to focus
on corporate video work.

247
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,762
I sent out my résumé.
I should start interviewing next week.

248
00:14:35,920 --> 00:14:37,922
Come here.

249
00:14:38,080 --> 00:14:41,607
Do you remember Ultimate Frisbee?
Not the districts, the regionals.

250
00:14:41,760 --> 00:14:44,604
I made that 50-yard huck to Sullivan.
It was an awesome pass.

251
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:48,810
- I don't know what we're talking about.
- What I'm saying is, don't worry.

252
00:14:48,960 --> 00:14:51,201
I'm at my best when my back
is against the wall.

253
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:53,488
This isn't college, Will.

254
00:14:54,440 --> 00:14:56,283
Please, I need you to step up.

255
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:02,966
Thirty years, one company. Wow!

256
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:06,522
An employer sees this,
and they see a dinosaur.

257
00:15:08,000 --> 00:15:12,164
Well, I can't say that
I agree with you there, Hernando.

258
00:15:12,320 --> 00:15:14,402
- Fernando.
- It's Fernando?

259
00:15:14,600 --> 00:15:16,921
You should do whatever you can
to look younger.

260
00:15:17,080 --> 00:15:18,923
For starters, lose the beard.

261
00:15:19,080 --> 00:15:21,890
An image consult is included
with the Platinum Package.

262
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:24,168
We'll give you a workstation,
some place to go every morning.

263
00:15:24,360 --> 00:15:29,241
And we will produce a video résumé
that will set you above the rabble.

264
00:15:29,400 --> 00:15:33,564
But all of that is just preparation
for the main event.

265
00:15:34,880 --> 00:15:38,282
Wilheimer has an 85%
placement rate, Mr. Davis.

266
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,171
- Wow!
- How do you think we make that number?

267
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,766
- Well, I...
- That's a rhetorical question.

268
00:15:43,960 --> 00:15:47,931
While everyone else is out
there wasting their time,

269
00:15:48,080 --> 00:15:50,321
meeting mid-level HR hacks,

270
00:15:50,480 --> 00:15:53,927
Wilheimer will be putting you
in front of the person

271
00:15:54,080 --> 00:15:58,085
who can pull the trigger
and actually hire you.

272
00:16:00,160 --> 00:16:02,891
- The decision maker?
- The decision maker.

273
00:16:04,720 --> 00:16:07,769
- That's right. Well...
- I like it.

274
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:10,161
Bottom line, how much are we talking here?

275
00:16:10,360 --> 00:16:15,651
The Platinum Package
is a one-time fee of $30,000.

276
00:16:21,280 --> 00:16:24,124
No, seriously, how much are we talking?

277
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:54,085
Hey, there!

278
00:16:54,280 --> 00:16:56,931
- Tough day?
- What?

279
00:16:58,800 --> 00:17:00,404
No, no, no.

280
00:17:00,560 --> 00:17:04,121
A tough day is just
an unrealized great day.

281
00:17:05,960 --> 00:17:08,611
Well, then, I'm gonna hook you up
with some Rockin' Moroccan.

282
00:17:08,760 --> 00:17:10,649
It's like legal hash.

283
00:17:11,680 --> 00:17:12,966
I'm Cammy. What's your name?

284
00:17:13,120 --> 00:17:15,282
- Roger.
- Roger that.

285
00:17:17,040 --> 00:17:18,804
Oh, to go, please.

286
00:17:20,680 --> 00:17:22,170
Hello?

287
00:17:23,040 --> 00:17:26,169
Oh, hey, honey. How are you?

288
00:17:26,320 --> 00:17:27,924
I'm at the office.

289
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,203
Oh, that music? Yeah, well, I...

290
00:17:31,400 --> 00:17:33,402
That's...

291
00:17:33,560 --> 00:17:35,927
You know Jerry.
He's just trying to jazz up his...

292
00:17:36,080 --> 00:17:38,003
I should get back to that meeting, honey.

293
00:17:38,200 --> 00:17:40,009
I'll see you in a few hours, okay?

294
00:17:40,200 --> 00:17:42,521
I love you too. Bye.

295
00:17:46,280 --> 00:17:48,760
That was my wife.

296
00:17:49,960 --> 00:17:54,249
Well, look, we have free Wi-Fi
and three-prong outlets out the wazoo.

297
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:56,646
So...

298
00:17:58,440 --> 00:18:00,807
And don't worry, Rog.

299
00:18:00,960 --> 00:18:03,566
No one here has a job.

300
00:18:29,360 --> 00:18:32,409
You children may begin.

301
00:18:32,560 --> 00:18:36,690
Now, the goal of this experiment
is to create an even coating,

302
00:18:36,880 --> 00:18:40,566
no excess charring, and no cold spots.

303
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:42,762
I mean it, Dayjon.

304
00:18:42,920 --> 00:18:45,969
And remember, don't stare in the flame
for too long, because it will...

305
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,880
steal your soul.

306
00:18:50,040 --> 00:18:52,042
Let me see that. Yeah.

307
00:19:01,760 --> 00:19:04,331
That is close to perfection.

308
00:19:04,480 --> 00:19:07,882
- Mr. Baxter?
- Stop calling me that!

309
00:19:08,080 --> 00:19:09,605
It's Charlie, okay?

310
00:19:09,760 --> 00:19:12,491
Okay, Charlie.

311
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,928
Why do all of our experiments
involve making food?

312
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,846
I get the munchies after free period.

313
00:19:20,000 --> 00:19:24,722
- Any more questions, Sergeant Buzzkill?
- No.

314
00:19:24,880 --> 00:19:26,689
- Mr. Baxter?
- It's Charlie!

315
00:19:26,840 --> 00:19:28,763
My sixth grade basketball coach just quit.

316
00:19:28,920 --> 00:19:30,524
You interested in the position?

317
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:34,002
I'm sorry, do I look like someone
with free time on his hands?

318
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:35,605
It's an extra $100 a week.

319
00:19:37,640 --> 00:19:39,688
They will prosper under my tutelage.

320
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:46,970
Tanya Sellers, Human Resources.

321
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:48,810
Sorry it took me so long
to get back to you.

322
00:19:49,000 --> 00:19:52,243
We received close to 1,000 résumés
for the videographer position.

323
00:19:52,400 --> 00:19:54,323
I was just glad that you called.

324
00:19:54,480 --> 00:19:56,369
Katherine Dunn oversees
our video services,

325
00:19:56,520 --> 00:19:58,522
but she's in China
on a leadership conference,

326
00:19:58,680 --> 00:20:01,968
so you get a nonstop flight
to the decision maker himself,

327
00:20:02,120 --> 00:20:03,531
Lawrence Wilheimer.

328
00:20:03,720 --> 00:20:04,926
He's a legend in executive placement.

329
00:20:05,080 --> 00:20:07,003
He revolutionized the game.

330
00:20:07,160 --> 00:20:09,686
- Make sure you check out his package.
- His retirement package?

331
00:20:09,840 --> 00:20:12,980
His package-package.
He's hung like a fucking minotaur.

332
00:20:13,080 --> 00:20:14,320
Fat.

333
00:20:18,800 --> 00:20:21,326
- William Davis.
- Yes, sir.

334
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:25,201
"Vast experience in all aspects
of video production."

335
00:20:26,360 --> 00:20:28,169
Could you elaborate on that?

336
00:20:28,320 --> 00:20:29,924
Well, sir, for the past seven years,

337
00:20:30,120 --> 00:20:32,726
I've been producing
original video content for YouTube.

338
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:35,888
- YouTube?
- Yes, sir.

339
00:20:36,040 --> 00:20:39,487
I think YouTube is the perfect training
ground for producing video résumés

340
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:41,290
that really stand out from the crowd.

341
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:44,569
And clients of Southern California's
premiere executive placement firm

342
00:20:44,760 --> 00:20:46,330
deserve those kind of résumés.

343
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,448
Ones that grab the employer's attention,
don't let go.

344
00:20:48,640 --> 00:20:50,244
Even if they say "uncle."

345
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:53,882
So, hire William Davis,
and your clients will...

346
00:20:56,720 --> 00:21:01,089
Hire William Davis, and your clients
will rise above the rest of the...

347
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:03,408
I'm so sorry about that.
Hire William Davis,

348
00:21:03,560 --> 00:21:06,245
and your clients will rise above and...

349
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,880
That's what you want, right?

350
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,323
My girlfriend and I are having a fight.
Do you mind if I...

351
00:21:13,720 --> 00:21:16,485
What could be more important?

352
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:18,563
Thank you, sir. That's what I'm saying.

353
00:21:20,560 --> 00:21:22,403
And send.

354
00:21:22,560 --> 00:21:24,085
So, where were we?

355
00:21:24,240 --> 00:21:27,005
I was showing you the door, Mr. Davis.

356
00:21:27,160 --> 00:21:28,366
That's it over there.

357
00:21:32,760 --> 00:21:34,683
Okay. Thank you.

358
00:21:38,800 --> 00:21:40,564
Look, sir, I don't think...

359
00:21:40,720 --> 00:21:43,007
I don't know if this is the exact
subject matter that you're looking for,

360
00:21:43,160 --> 00:21:45,288
but I think that this really
showcases my abilities

361
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,090
to recognize what's unique
about an individual

362
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:50,523
and how to foreground that
for the marketplace.

363
00:21:53,280 --> 00:21:54,805
What is your business philosophy?

364
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:58,926
It is all about customer satisfaction.

365
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:03,722
We are basically
the Burlington Coat Factory of bitches.

366
00:22:03,920 --> 00:22:06,651
I got bitches on layaway,
you know what I'm saying?

367
00:22:06,840 --> 00:22:09,286
For $599, you can mark down a bitch.

368
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,808
All right, hey, just, you know,
be careful with it, man.

369
00:22:13,320 --> 00:22:15,527
I really don't like these guys.

370
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,160
Watch your fingerprints. Are you serious?

371
00:22:18,320 --> 00:22:20,527
That's a big-boy TV. Come on, man.

372
00:22:20,680 --> 00:22:23,889
- Use an HDMI cord. Don't use...
- Thanks, bro.

373
00:22:24,040 --> 00:22:25,644
Take care of my TV, bro.

374
00:22:27,360 --> 00:22:31,001
- Yeah, this is Will.
- Will, Tanya, from Wilheimer.

375
00:22:31,200 --> 00:22:34,363
- Are you calling about my interview?
- Sure am.

376
00:22:34,520 --> 00:22:37,569
- Mr. Wilheimer pressing charges?
- You're in, player!

377
00:22:37,720 --> 00:22:39,370
- What?
- You're in.

378
00:22:39,520 --> 00:22:41,170
Starting salary is $26,000,

379
00:22:41,320 --> 00:22:44,210
partial health benefits
kick in after 90 days.

380
00:22:44,360 --> 00:22:46,203
Wait, are you saying that I have a job?

381
00:22:46,360 --> 00:22:47,521
That's what I'm saying.

382
00:22:47,720 --> 00:22:50,087
Wait, wait, wait!

383
00:22:52,000 --> 00:22:55,083
Hello, you got good news.

384
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,608
Tell Will he gets the job
as soon as he passes a drug test.

385
00:22:58,760 --> 00:23:01,001
Drug test? Is it multiple choice?

386
00:23:02,520 --> 00:23:04,602
Hey, what's up, Dad?

387
00:23:07,680 --> 00:23:08,681
What's going on?

388
00:23:08,840 --> 00:23:09,841
I got a job.

389
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:12,002
Hey!

390
00:23:12,200 --> 00:23:14,089
- That's great!
- I know.

391
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:16,368
It's at this place called Wilheimer.
They do job placement.

392
00:23:16,520 --> 00:23:19,285
Oh, yeah. I've heard good things.

393
00:23:19,440 --> 00:23:21,966
I just need one thing...

394
00:23:22,960 --> 00:23:24,883
and I'm good to go.

395
00:23:25,800 --> 00:23:27,290
- You're smoking pot?
- I'm an occasional user!

396
00:23:27,440 --> 00:23:29,124
I never smoke and drive!

397
00:23:29,280 --> 00:23:33,001
And you want me to urinate into this bottle
so that you can pass a drug test?

398
00:23:33,160 --> 00:23:35,891
- Goddamn it!
- Dad, look, there's no one else I can ask.

399
00:23:36,040 --> 00:23:39,328
I'm hanging by a thread with Jillian, plus
they might be able to screen for gender.

400
00:23:39,520 --> 00:23:42,888
Ethan is tainted, Luke is unclean,
and Charlie's radioactive.

401
00:23:43,040 --> 00:23:44,246
What am I supposed to do?

402
00:23:44,440 --> 00:23:45,680
Get new friends!

403
00:23:45,840 --> 00:23:47,171
I have a job.

404
00:23:47,360 --> 00:23:48,885
I've a real job for a real company.

405
00:23:49,040 --> 00:23:50,883
The kind of job that you've
been bugging me to get for years.

406
00:23:51,040 --> 00:23:53,088
And if I don't produce
an immaculate cup of urine,

407
00:23:53,280 --> 00:23:56,124
it's back to the unemployment line.
Is that what you want?

408
00:23:56,280 --> 00:23:58,647
No, it's not what I want. You know that.

409
00:23:58,800 --> 00:24:01,451
I just don't feel comfortable doing this.

410
00:24:02,040 --> 00:24:03,451
Okay.

411
00:24:03,600 --> 00:24:04,965
Air conditioning, so...

412
00:24:05,120 --> 00:24:07,327
- No.
- It was 100 degrees in that warehouse,

413
00:24:07,480 --> 00:24:09,323
and you did whatever it took
to get off the floor.

414
00:24:09,480 --> 00:24:11,881
And that's what I'm doing.
That's what I'm doing.

415
00:24:12,040 --> 00:24:13,849
I'm doing what you told me.

416
00:24:41,080 --> 00:24:42,969
What happened to you?

417
00:24:43,120 --> 00:24:45,202
Hey, I just pulled a hammy.

418
00:24:45,360 --> 00:24:47,089
- Pounding box?
- What?

419
00:24:47,240 --> 00:24:49,402
Pounding box? Putting it in that pussy.

420
00:24:49,560 --> 00:24:51,050
Giving it to her. Yeah.

421
00:24:51,200 --> 00:24:53,521
No, I was hitting the gym.

422
00:24:54,600 --> 00:24:57,444
- Hitting those weights.
- All right.

423
00:24:57,640 --> 00:24:59,768
- Ready to make it rain?
- Ready as I'll ever be.

424
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:05,650
What are you doing?

425
00:25:05,800 --> 00:25:09,009
I'm required to be in here,
in case you try some monkey business.

426
00:25:09,160 --> 00:25:12,130
Okay. Are you gonna
come in the stall with me too?

427
00:25:12,320 --> 00:25:15,369
No stall, baby doll.
You gotta rock out with that cock out.

428
00:25:15,520 --> 00:25:17,966
I'll just be right behind here,
listening close.

429
00:25:18,160 --> 00:25:21,369
Okay, I kind of have a shy bladder.

430
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:24,649
Oh, that's too bad,
because you have 30 seconds.

431
00:25:24,800 --> 00:25:26,245
Starting now!

432
00:25:29,680 --> 00:25:33,082
If you're having trouble,
just think of waterfalls!

433
00:25:34,600 --> 00:25:39,083
Or, like, fire hoses just
blasting water out.

434
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:43,528
22, 21...

435
00:25:43,680 --> 00:25:46,251
Think of, like, things gushing!

436
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,249
Or, like, squirting.

437
00:25:48,440 --> 00:25:50,647
18, 17...

438
00:25:50,800 --> 00:25:55,169
You know, I'm a squirter, but only if I'm,
like, comfortable with a person.

439
00:25:57,200 --> 00:26:01,091
Ten, nine, eight,

440
00:26:01,240 --> 00:26:05,404
seven, six, five...

441
00:26:05,560 --> 00:26:07,244
All right, that's enough! I'm coming in!

442
00:26:08,480 --> 00:26:09,561
Got it!

443
00:26:11,080 --> 00:26:12,570
Hi-ho, Silver.

444
00:26:15,920 --> 00:26:17,285
Wow!

445
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:26,409
Oh, my God. Oh, shit.

446
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,241
Man, I should get a job more often.

447
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:33,011
- Fuck, yeah!
- Fuck, yeah! That was awesome.

448
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:35,804
I have something else for you.

449
00:26:35,960 --> 00:26:37,086
Back door?

450
00:26:37,280 --> 00:26:38,930
- Yeah, I'll go get my strap-on.
- Okay.

451
00:26:39,080 --> 00:26:40,286
You love it!

452
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:44,970
What is this?

453
00:26:50,080 --> 00:26:52,082
Can I see it?

454
00:26:52,240 --> 00:26:54,242
Yeah, yeah. Of course.

455
00:26:56,000 --> 00:26:57,240
Oh, baby.

456
00:27:00,160 --> 00:27:03,084
My unique skill set allows me
to seamlessly integrate

457
00:27:03,240 --> 00:27:05,561
into a range of management structures,

458
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:09,327
which makes me highly employable
in today's marketplace.

459
00:27:10,520 --> 00:27:14,206
Mainly I've found that dealing
with people is my best skill.

460
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,611
I have a lot of charisma.

461
00:27:20,280 --> 00:27:24,126
An ordinary man takes everything
as a blessing or a curse.

462
00:27:24,280 --> 00:27:27,329
A warrior takes it as a challenge.

463
00:27:28,800 --> 00:27:30,564
Who are you?

464
00:27:40,520 --> 00:27:42,204
Exciting stuff.

465
00:27:42,360 --> 00:27:43,646
Yeah, it's riveting.

466
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:48,126
Just follow the boilerplate,
and you'll be fine.

467
00:27:48,280 --> 00:27:51,602
Clients choose from three backgrounds.
Skyline.

468
00:27:51,760 --> 00:27:56,129
There's also Corner Office and Bookshelf.

469
00:27:56,320 --> 00:27:58,641
Corner Office and Bookshelf. Got it.

470
00:28:03,280 --> 00:28:05,328
I made a video in here once.

471
00:28:06,440 --> 00:28:08,966
And I'm not the only one.

472
00:28:09,160 --> 00:28:11,481
Okay, thank you. Thank you.

473
00:28:11,640 --> 00:28:13,961
Oh, Mr. Wilheimer, I wanted
to thank you for this opportunity.

474
00:28:14,120 --> 00:28:17,169
Oh, well, always on the lookout
for fresh talent, Will.

475
00:28:17,320 --> 00:28:18,651
Just one thing.

476
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,491
Could you put me in touch
with that fellow from your video?

477
00:28:21,640 --> 00:28:23,324
The...

478
00:28:26,640 --> 00:28:28,483
Yes, sir. In six months to a year.

479
00:28:30,640 --> 00:28:33,120
Depending on good behavior.

480
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:50,364
What the fuck? What the fuck!

481
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:54,606
How is it possible to be this bad?

482
00:28:54,760 --> 00:28:56,364
Ball.

483
00:28:57,600 --> 00:28:58,681
Okay.

484
00:28:59,840 --> 00:29:02,525
Kwan, let's review the basics.

485
00:29:02,680 --> 00:29:03,886
Give and go!

486
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:08,370
Jesus Christ.

487
00:29:12,440 --> 00:29:16,001
Big Stuff, anyone ever show you
how to set a pick?

488
00:29:16,160 --> 00:29:17,207
No.

489
00:29:21,320 --> 00:29:23,004
Get ready to bring some pain.

490
00:29:31,600 --> 00:29:33,250
Hamilton!

491
00:29:33,400 --> 00:29:34,731
Come here!

492
00:29:36,160 --> 00:29:38,811
This is deer scent.

493
00:29:39,000 --> 00:29:41,207
I use it out in the wild when I hunt.

494
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:43,889
I use it in here,

495
00:29:44,040 --> 00:29:47,931
when I think a clerk
is ready for his very own desk.

496
00:29:50,040 --> 00:29:51,280
Drink it.

497
00:29:56,000 --> 00:29:57,240
Hold it!

498
00:29:58,520 --> 00:30:00,682
I'm gonna go ahead and let him
make up his own mind.

499
00:30:02,320 --> 00:30:04,322
Do you want your own desk?

500
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:07,446
Or do you want to be a fucking clerk
the rest of your life?

501
00:30:08,840 --> 00:30:10,444
Your call.

502
00:30:23,320 --> 00:30:24,765
Two-to-one he drinks the deer cum.

503
00:30:27,440 --> 00:30:29,283
Deer cum?

504
00:30:29,440 --> 00:30:31,681
Drink it. Drink the deer cum.

505
00:30:31,840 --> 00:30:33,763
Deer cum.

506
00:30:33,920 --> 00:30:36,764
Deer cum! Deer cum! Deer cum!

507
00:30:54,280 --> 00:30:57,648
Uh-oh! Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I think it's coming back up.

508
00:30:57,800 --> 00:30:59,928
500 bucks says he gonna hurl.

509
00:31:01,480 --> 00:31:05,007
- Breathe.
- You like that nutty taste in your mouth?

510
00:31:05,160 --> 00:31:06,810
Oh, that's Bambi batter.

511
00:31:07,840 --> 00:31:09,330
Give it to me.

512
00:31:09,480 --> 00:31:10,481
Roll it around.

513
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,086
Awesome!

514
00:31:44,040 --> 00:31:45,530
Did you see the arc on that?

515
00:31:48,080 --> 00:31:49,366
You're my bitch.

516
00:31:49,520 --> 00:31:50,965
Hey, guys, you're gonna want
to pause the game for this.

517
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:52,849
- Ethan, what are you doing, man?
- Come on, man!

518
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:55,446
It's a game of Halo!
Relax, I've got something to show you.

519
00:31:55,640 --> 00:31:57,881
- Wait!
- Come on, move.

520
00:31:58,800 --> 00:32:00,802
This better be good.

521
00:32:04,800 --> 00:32:06,040
Oh, my God!

522
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,123
Dude, I found some extra tubing
in my chem class.

523
00:32:08,320 --> 00:32:09,685
I put my little boys and girls to work.

524
00:32:09,840 --> 00:32:11,729
- Nice!
- What's the special occasion?

525
00:32:11,880 --> 00:32:13,405
Yeah, we're celebrating me getting a desk.

526
00:32:13,560 --> 00:32:15,847
- Oh, that's right.
- And me buying an island.

527
00:32:16,000 --> 00:32:17,923
- You're not buying an island.
- No?

528
00:32:18,120 --> 00:32:20,168
Because I met someone who knows
Warren Buffett's bridge partner.

529
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,402
I'm gonna offer him some stock
from my company

530
00:32:22,560 --> 00:32:24,801
in exchange for Warren Buffett's
cell phone number.

531
00:32:25,000 --> 00:32:27,480
I'm gonna iSearchU Warren Buffett,
pitch him my app,

532
00:32:27,640 --> 00:32:30,405
gain access to billions of dollars
in venture capital,

533
00:32:30,560 --> 00:32:33,564
buy my island,
and populate it with porn stars.

534
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:36,041
I'm sorry I doubted you.

535
00:32:36,200 --> 00:32:38,601
- No, you didn't know the plan.
- I didn't know the plan.

536
00:32:40,120 --> 00:32:42,282
Rick. What's up, man?

537
00:32:45,600 --> 00:32:50,561
Oh, Will, this is Katherine Dunn,
Vice President of our Client Services.

538
00:32:50,720 --> 00:32:53,929
It's good to have you back.
Get ready to have your mind blown.

539
00:32:54,080 --> 00:32:56,606
Because I'm taking video résumés
to the next level.

540
00:32:56,760 --> 00:32:58,683
Okay? Ready for this?

541
00:33:03,600 --> 00:33:06,809
People think accountants are a bunch
of number-crunching nerds,

542
00:33:07,000 --> 00:33:08,445
but I'm a jazz buff

543
00:33:08,600 --> 00:33:12,207
I like to think of the tax code
as my instrument.

544
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:45,000
I'm Tom Wilson,
at tomwilsonaccountant.com.

545
00:33:48,440 --> 00:33:50,966
That was quite impactful.

546
00:33:51,120 --> 00:33:52,281
So, what do we think?

547
00:33:52,440 --> 00:33:53,771
I think it makes him seem youthful.

548
00:33:53,920 --> 00:33:56,082
Yeah, until now,
I always thought of Tom as a total dud.

549
00:33:59,680 --> 00:34:02,843
This is an executive placement firm,
Mr. Davis,

550
00:34:03,000 --> 00:34:05,241
not MTV.

551
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:07,801
Yeah, nobody's going to hire this guy
because of his personality.

552
00:34:07,960 --> 00:34:10,201
Yeah, he needs to look professional.

553
00:34:10,400 --> 00:34:13,210
Everyone's always loved
the old résumés, so...

554
00:34:15,040 --> 00:34:16,929
You seem to have mistaken this video

555
00:34:17,080 --> 00:34:21,165
as an opportunity
to express yourself, Mr. Davis.

556
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:25,086
From now on, you will follow
the guidebook to the letter.

557
00:34:25,240 --> 00:34:29,086
Yeah, I found the guidebook
to be kind of limiting.

558
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:34,244
I wrote the guidebook, Mr. Davis.

559
00:34:34,400 --> 00:34:36,209
And while I have you here,

560
00:34:36,360 --> 00:34:40,001
there are some issues of comportment
that apparently need clarification.

561
00:34:40,160 --> 00:34:43,403
You will maintain
a professional appearance.

562
00:34:43,600 --> 00:34:46,729
That means a suit and a tie.

563
00:34:47,880 --> 00:34:50,611
It does not mean sneakers.

564
00:34:50,760 --> 00:34:53,331
It does not mean khakis.

565
00:34:53,480 --> 00:34:57,041
It does not mean that unwashed rag
you call a T-shirt.

566
00:34:58,840 --> 00:35:00,046
Got it.

567
00:35:00,240 --> 00:35:01,685
"Got it"?

568
00:35:02,600 --> 00:35:03,601
Understood?

569
00:35:07,360 --> 00:35:09,567
And while I was away,

570
00:35:09,720 --> 00:35:14,123
I was a recipient of several
of your reply-all e-mails.

571
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:18,046
They were inappropriate, offensive,

572
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:22,171
and most of all, not funny.

573
00:35:22,320 --> 00:35:26,325
Nobody wants a birthday spanking
from you, Mr. Davis.

574
00:35:30,360 --> 00:35:35,048
And finally, I took a look
at your Facebook page

575
00:35:35,200 --> 00:35:38,409
and was confronted with this sordid image.

576
00:35:41,080 --> 00:35:43,242
I was there for the buffet.

577
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:49,401
You are an employee
of this company, Mr. Davis.

578
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,724
Your behavior must conform
to the exacting standards

579
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:57,208
of the Wilheimer Executive Placement Firm.

580
00:35:57,360 --> 00:35:59,761
- Is that understood?
- Understood.

581
00:35:59,920 --> 00:36:02,400
- Understood?
- Understood.

582
00:36:06,800 --> 00:36:08,723
Hi, Pearl. Roger Davis.

583
00:36:08,880 --> 00:36:10,723
Is Mr. Gentry in?

584
00:36:10,880 --> 00:36:12,689
He's not? Okay.

585
00:36:12,840 --> 00:36:16,083
Do you know if he's had a chance
to look at my résumé yet?

586
00:36:17,480 --> 00:36:20,848
Regional Distribution Manager,
Scanner and Disk Duplicator Division?

587
00:36:22,480 --> 00:36:25,370
No. Okay.

588
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:32,245
Do you know if he received the package
of Rockin' Moroccan coffee that...

589
00:36:32,400 --> 00:36:35,563
Oh, hello?
Okay, why don't you hang up first?

590
00:36:39,520 --> 00:36:41,329
- Hey!
- Hey.

591
00:36:41,480 --> 00:36:42,845
Hi, buddy!

592
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,366
Come on into my office here.

593
00:36:46,520 --> 00:36:48,124
Cammy, come on over.

594
00:36:48,280 --> 00:36:50,931
This is Will.
Will, this is my friend, Cammy.

595
00:36:51,080 --> 00:36:53,242
Hey, Will. How's the job working out?

596
00:36:53,440 --> 00:36:55,841
- It's good.
- Good.

597
00:36:56,000 --> 00:36:57,843
Dad, what did you do to your beard?

598
00:36:58,000 --> 00:37:01,482
Well, I lost two jobs in a week
to people in their 30s.

599
00:37:01,640 --> 00:37:05,690
So Cammy volunteered
to make me look ten years younger.

600
00:37:05,840 --> 00:37:08,684
Gothic Raven. What do you think?

601
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:11,203
Yeah.

602
00:37:11,360 --> 00:37:13,044
Cammy, are you helping him out
with his Twitter feed, too?

603
00:37:13,200 --> 00:37:15,009
Oh, Rog doesn't need any help.

604
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,050
Yeah? I think Rog needs
a little bit of help.

605
00:37:18,200 --> 00:37:22,410
"My friend Jim lost his mother
yesterday. LOL, Jim."

606
00:37:22,560 --> 00:37:24,528
What? "Lots of love."

607
00:37:24,720 --> 00:37:26,961
It's okay. You want another one, Rog?

608
00:37:27,120 --> 00:37:29,441
Keep them coming.
Oh, one for Will, too, please.

609
00:37:29,640 --> 00:37:31,722
- Oh, yeah.
- I'm okay, whoever you are.

610
00:37:31,880 --> 00:37:33,803
So, what's up?

611
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,725
Well, my supervisor's back from leave,
and she is a total ballbuster.

612
00:37:36,880 --> 00:37:38,564
I mean, she was on my ass
about my e-mails,

613
00:37:38,720 --> 00:37:40,643
and my Facebook page,
and how I dress in front of everybody.

614
00:37:40,800 --> 00:37:42,723
It was humiliating.

615
00:37:42,880 --> 00:37:44,962
Wait, this isn't how you dress
at work, is it?

616
00:37:45,120 --> 00:37:48,363
Dad, I'm the video guy.
Who cares what I look like?

617
00:37:48,520 --> 00:37:51,729
Look, just stop, okay? Stop for a second.

618
00:37:51,880 --> 00:37:56,522
Your clients pay $30,000
for your services.

619
00:37:56,680 --> 00:37:58,170
They care what you look like.

620
00:37:58,320 --> 00:38:01,483
You need to conform to their standards,
not the other way around.

621
00:38:01,640 --> 00:38:05,281
And the fact that you can't grasp that
is mind-boggling!

622
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:07,846
What is up with you?

623
00:38:08,000 --> 00:38:11,322
What is up with me is,
I've sent out hundreds of résumés,

624
00:38:11,480 --> 00:38:13,767
and I've gotten only three interviews.

625
00:38:13,920 --> 00:38:17,083
What is up with me is,
I don't want to hear you bitch and moan

626
00:38:17,240 --> 00:38:20,164
that your employer makes you act
in a professional manner.

627
00:38:20,360 --> 00:38:21,771
That is what's up with me.

628
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,082
Okay, Dad, well, look,
I'm sorry for telling you how I feel.

629
00:38:24,280 --> 00:38:27,045
I didn't know just because I have a job and
you don't that you wouldn't listen to me.

630
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:31,370
Oh, I'm listening, all right,
but all I hear is a spoiled little brat!

631
00:38:32,520 --> 00:38:33,646
Okay.

632
00:38:36,640 --> 00:38:37,971
You look like Billy Mays.

633
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:43,371
- I look like Willie Mays?
- You look like Billy Mays!

634
00:38:43,520 --> 00:38:45,488
Who's Billy Mays?

635
00:38:46,120 --> 00:38:48,407
If you're gonna tell someone off,
make it clear!

636
00:39:01,560 --> 00:39:03,403
What do you think?

637
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:06,803
Hot. Very, very hot.

638
00:39:09,200 --> 00:39:11,487
They're Prada.

639
00:39:11,640 --> 00:39:13,449
They were $779.

640
00:39:15,240 --> 00:39:17,208
I know. I just...

641
00:39:19,040 --> 00:39:21,281
I just want them
to take me seriously at work.

642
00:39:21,440 --> 00:39:24,046
Everybody takes you seriously.

643
00:39:24,720 --> 00:39:27,326
- They do?
- Yes, they do.

644
00:39:27,480 --> 00:39:29,403
Sophomore year.

645
00:39:29,560 --> 00:39:32,564
We're running Ultimate Frisbee drills
down in the lounge.

646
00:39:33,760 --> 00:39:36,001
Ethan comes in and says
that there's a situation

647
00:39:36,160 --> 00:39:38,128
that I need to handle downstairs.

648
00:39:38,280 --> 00:39:43,320
So, I go downstairs,
and I see this tiny little person

649
00:39:43,520 --> 00:39:45,409
in pajamas and slippers,

650
00:39:45,560 --> 00:39:49,007
and she is so, so angry.

651
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,365
I was trying to study.

652
00:39:52,760 --> 00:39:56,526
The moment that I saw you, I knew that
you were someone to take seriously.

653
00:40:00,680 --> 00:40:02,921
What are you gonna do about work, Will?

654
00:40:52,000 --> 00:40:53,684
Have a nice day, boys!

655
00:40:58,840 --> 00:41:01,286
Hey! Ooh, it's coming down.

656
00:41:03,080 --> 00:41:05,560
- Look at you.
- Yeah, right?

657
00:41:06,280 --> 00:41:08,123
Look at you.

658
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,123
Oh, yeah.

659
00:41:10,320 --> 00:41:12,766
- Yeah, looks good.
- Well... Thanks.

660
00:41:14,120 --> 00:41:17,488
- So, is anything good here?
- Oh, everything's good here.

661
00:41:17,640 --> 00:41:18,846
- Really?
- Yeah.

662
00:41:19,000 --> 00:41:21,162
Can I get two pork and bean burritos,

663
00:41:21,320 --> 00:41:23,209
four beef machacas, and two beers?

664
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:27,884
- Hey, what are you doing?
- I'm paying for our...

665
00:41:28,040 --> 00:41:29,644
No, you're not. Tonight's on me.

666
00:41:37,560 --> 00:41:38,607
Oh, man.

667
00:41:38,760 --> 00:41:40,888
This is my first machaca. It's great.

668
00:41:43,840 --> 00:41:45,046
Hey, Dad.

669
00:41:46,080 --> 00:41:47,650
I'm sorry about last week.

670
00:41:49,600 --> 00:41:51,170
Yeah, me too.

671
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:58,201
Could we get some beer, please?
Two tequila shots.

672
00:41:59,520 --> 00:42:01,010
Let's get hammered.

673
00:42:01,200 --> 00:42:02,326
Cheers.

674
00:42:04,240 --> 00:42:05,366
Drink up.

675
00:42:07,080 --> 00:42:08,206
- Fuck.
- See?

676
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:09,361
Yeah, it's all right.

677
00:42:09,520 --> 00:42:11,249
All right, Dad.
You know why we're doing this?

678
00:42:11,400 --> 00:42:12,526
- Why?
- We're doing this

679
00:42:12,680 --> 00:42:14,205
so that what's-his-name...

680
00:42:14,360 --> 00:42:15,646
- Your...
- Oh, my guy?

681
00:42:15,840 --> 00:42:18,446
James Gentry. The decision maker.

682
00:42:18,640 --> 00:42:21,291
Right. So James Gentry
can find out who you are.

683
00:42:21,440 --> 00:42:24,125
Yeah. Who am I?

684
00:42:25,360 --> 00:42:27,249
You're a great man.

685
00:42:30,000 --> 00:42:33,686
You supported me my whole life, Dad.
Let me repay the favor, please.

686
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:37,121
Okay.

687
00:42:37,320 --> 00:42:39,049
- Okay. Ready?
- Okay.

688
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:41,447
- Do this again, that makes me know.
- Yeah, okay.

689
00:42:42,240 --> 00:42:43,924
Let's press record.

690
00:42:45,800 --> 00:42:48,531
- Go.
- My name is Roger Davis.

691
00:42:48,680 --> 00:42:51,809
I'm very punctual, and faithful...

692
00:42:52,000 --> 00:42:55,243
Oh, God! I'm so terrible at this.

693
00:42:58,680 --> 00:43:02,401
I need to do something productive.

694
00:43:05,000 --> 00:43:06,570
Something worthwhile.

695
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,404
Really all it's about.

696
00:43:13,200 --> 00:43:15,487
Do you know, work has always
been more important to me

697
00:43:15,640 --> 00:43:17,483
than anyone else I know?

698
00:43:17,640 --> 00:43:21,087
It just has. I love it. I love it.

699
00:43:25,560 --> 00:43:28,723
I just need to get into
the employer and see them.

700
00:43:28,880 --> 00:43:31,281
Do you know? One-on-one.

701
00:43:31,440 --> 00:43:34,523
And if they can just
somehow get to know me,

702
00:43:34,680 --> 00:43:35,806
just even a little bit,

703
00:43:35,960 --> 00:43:39,009
then they would know
why they should hire me.

704
00:43:40,440 --> 00:43:43,444
That is the goal. That's the goal.

705
00:43:46,880 --> 00:43:49,645
So, anyway, I'm sorry. I'm blabbering on.

706
00:43:49,800 --> 00:43:51,643
All right, we need to do this.

707
00:43:51,800 --> 00:43:54,451
- All right.
- No, we're good.

708
00:43:54,600 --> 00:43:55,965
No, I'll try it, I'll try it.

709
00:43:56,120 --> 00:43:57,724
Dad, another time.

710
00:43:58,400 --> 00:43:59,640
All right.

711
00:43:59,800 --> 00:44:02,531
If I drink anymore of this,
this is not going to go well.

712
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:04,205
- Well, we got six more to go.
- Whoa!

713
00:44:05,440 --> 00:44:06,487
Yeah!

714
00:44:07,880 --> 00:44:09,644
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

715
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,121
- Absolutely!
- You did!

716
00:44:12,280 --> 00:44:13,611
You did, too.

717
00:44:30,400 --> 00:44:34,041
- Good afternoon, Mr. Buffett.
- Oh, jeez!

718
00:44:34,200 --> 00:44:36,487
I am sure you're wondering
how I knew that you were in town.

719
00:44:36,640 --> 00:44:39,962
Because you read it in the LA Times?

720
00:44:40,120 --> 00:44:41,360
Damn it!

721
00:44:41,520 --> 00:44:44,364
Actually, through the use
of GPS triangulation,

722
00:44:44,520 --> 00:44:46,522
my app, the iSearchU,

723
00:44:46,680 --> 00:44:48,284
allowed me to send you a text message

724
00:44:48,440 --> 00:44:50,169
and receive back your exact location,

725
00:44:50,320 --> 00:44:52,607
right down to this stall. It's incredible!

726
00:44:52,760 --> 00:44:56,003
You know Foursquare
does that already, right?

727
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,446
No, no, no. You don't get it.

728
00:44:57,600 --> 00:45:00,206
Foursquare lets you
tell other people where you are.

729
00:45:00,360 --> 00:45:03,921
My app tells me where you are
even if you don't want me to know.

730
00:45:04,080 --> 00:45:05,889
It's a game changer, sir, okay?

731
00:45:06,040 --> 00:45:08,088
I'm telling you, if you say yes right now,

732
00:45:08,240 --> 00:45:11,164
I can promise you 50-50 in my company.

733
00:45:14,720 --> 00:45:16,927
60-40.

734
00:45:17,080 --> 00:45:18,809
You drive a hard bargain, sir.

735
00:45:18,960 --> 00:45:21,361
65-35, last offer.

736
00:45:23,440 --> 00:45:26,569
You know... I like it.

737
00:45:27,560 --> 00:45:29,085
You do?

738
00:45:29,240 --> 00:45:31,402
Let me text my people.

739
00:45:31,560 --> 00:45:33,688
Oh, my God! I knew that you would like it.

740
00:45:33,840 --> 00:45:36,764
You're the Oracle of Omaha.
You are a visionary like me, sir.

741
00:45:36,960 --> 00:45:39,167
This is incredible.

742
00:45:39,320 --> 00:45:40,810
What the fuck is this?

743
00:45:40,960 --> 00:45:42,450
What the fuck? Hey!

744
00:45:43,880 --> 00:45:45,848
Who has security guards
when they take shits?

745
00:45:46,000 --> 00:45:47,889
What the fuck is wrong with you, Buffett?

746
00:45:48,040 --> 00:45:50,281
You can't hide from the iStalkU!

747
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:52,124
Buffett!

748
00:45:53,320 --> 00:45:56,881
Double-shot white chocolate mocha
with extra cream.

749
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,849
Where are we on the Fredericks video?

750
00:45:59,000 --> 00:46:00,843
On schedule for tomorrow afternoon.

751
00:46:01,680 --> 00:46:04,331
I was hoping for some personal time
tomorrow afternoon.

752
00:46:06,040 --> 00:46:07,041
Say no more.

753
00:46:07,240 --> 00:46:09,925
I will stay late tonight and get it
to you first thing in the morning.

754
00:46:13,320 --> 00:46:14,685
Will?

755
00:46:15,880 --> 00:46:17,848
There are going to be
some changes around here.

756
00:46:19,280 --> 00:46:20,611
Changes?

757
00:46:20,760 --> 00:46:24,367
I'm taking Wilheimer
into the 21 st century.

758
00:46:24,520 --> 00:46:29,363
There will be a new position created,
Vice President of Corporate Communications.

759
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:32,967
You keep up the good work,
that Vice President is you.

760
00:46:35,360 --> 00:46:37,169
- Hey, Fernando.
- Fernando.

761
00:46:37,320 --> 00:46:38,606
- Sorry?
- Fernando.

762
00:46:38,760 --> 00:46:41,730
Fernando, right.
Tanya said that I should talk to you.

763
00:46:41,880 --> 00:46:43,405
About what?

764
00:46:43,560 --> 00:46:45,483
I have some extra work
that I'm doing tonight,

765
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:47,768
and I just need a little help.

766
00:46:47,920 --> 00:46:50,969
- You want me to do your work for you?
- No, no, no.

767
00:46:51,160 --> 00:46:54,164
What I'm saying is that she said
that I should talk to you.

768
00:46:54,320 --> 00:46:55,481
About, you know...

769
00:46:58,160 --> 00:46:59,685
I have ADD.

770
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:04,206
You know there's
two Fernandos in this office?

771
00:47:05,520 --> 00:47:08,649
Fernando Little,
Director of Client Services,

772
00:47:08,840 --> 00:47:11,366
Division Sales Leader,
three years running.

773
00:47:11,520 --> 00:47:13,443
And Fernando, the janitor.

774
00:47:16,320 --> 00:47:18,527
Mi madre, she's a psychiatrist.

775
00:47:18,680 --> 00:47:21,411
So, I can hook you up
with whatever you need.

776
00:47:21,560 --> 00:47:22,846
Those are drugs.

777
00:47:24,600 --> 00:47:25,886
Saw you last night.

778
00:47:28,120 --> 00:47:29,690
With tu papa.

779
00:47:31,360 --> 00:47:33,044
You're not gonna tell anyone, are you?

780
00:47:35,280 --> 00:47:37,248
Wasn't close to mi papa.

781
00:47:38,280 --> 00:47:39,691
Your words...

782
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:42,760
They moved me.

783
00:47:47,280 --> 00:47:50,250
I will take it to the grave.

784
00:47:51,760 --> 00:47:53,922
Now, someone with extra work...

785
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:58,330
- may I recommend...
- Dexedrine?

786
00:48:01,040 --> 00:48:02,485
Sexy Dexy.

787
00:48:03,200 --> 00:48:07,649
He's an attorney.
And I worked at his legal practice,

788
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,280
as an intern...

789
00:48:10,440 --> 00:48:14,650
Mainly I found that dealing
with people was my best skill.

790
00:48:14,800 --> 00:48:17,201
So, he would have me deliver...

791
00:48:17,360 --> 00:48:19,408
We started out delivering packages...

792
00:48:21,720 --> 00:48:24,246
And then ultimately...

793
00:48:24,400 --> 00:48:26,368
I have a lot of charisma.

794
00:48:27,840 --> 00:48:28,921
My unique... I can be...

795
00:48:29,080 --> 00:48:30,491
...makes me highly...

796
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,008
...highly employable
in today's marketplace.

797
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,248
I'm Lawrence Wilheimer and I'm old!

798
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:41,482
And I don't understand technology
because I'm so old.

799
00:48:41,640 --> 00:48:44,246
So I have Will
clear my browser history every day!

800
00:48:45,760 --> 00:48:46,807
Oh, my God!

801
00:48:46,960 --> 00:48:48,689
- Who's the decision maker?
- You are.

802
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:51,286
- You... You're... You are...
- That's good.

803
00:48:52,760 --> 00:48:54,728
- Will Davis.
- Dude!

804
00:48:54,880 --> 00:48:56,848
- You're viral!
- What?

805
00:48:57,000 --> 00:49:00,607
Your Skeezy video has over
114,000 hits on YouTube!

806
00:49:00,760 --> 00:49:02,808
- YouTube?
- Yeah, YouTube.

807
00:49:03,000 --> 00:49:04,001
YouTube? YouTube?

808
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,605
It's fucking YouTube.
Am I saying this wrong?

809
00:49:05,760 --> 00:49:07,125
- Yeah, that's YouTube.
- That's YouTube, right?

810
00:49:07,280 --> 00:49:08,406
- Yeah, that's...
- Yeah, let him know.

811
00:49:08,560 --> 00:49:09,686
It's YouTube, Will!

812
00:49:14,680 --> 00:49:16,205
Well, I structured my business

813
00:49:16,360 --> 00:49:19,489
around the same eco-friendly model
as Ben and Jerry's.

814
00:49:19,680 --> 00:49:20,761
You know what I'm sayin'?

815
00:49:20,920 --> 00:49:23,651
Bitches going to go for
the pimp with best work environment.

816
00:49:23,800 --> 00:49:26,644
That's why we got free STD testing,
free condoms...

817
00:49:26,800 --> 00:49:29,340
I'm viral! Yes!

818
00:49:29,440 --> 00:49:33,365
And even a dental plan.
You can't be having no toothless bitches!

819
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,926
How much you know about us
as a company, Will?

820
00:49:37,080 --> 00:49:39,082
Absolutely nothing.

821
00:49:39,240 --> 00:49:42,722
Join the club, brother. We will fix that.

822
00:49:42,880 --> 00:49:44,962
- Sweat Body Spray?
- Yeah.

823
00:49:45,120 --> 00:49:46,485
When kids put that on,

824
00:49:46,640 --> 00:49:48,642
I want them to know
they're sending a message.

825
00:49:48,800 --> 00:49:51,246
- Guess what the message is?
- "I'm cool."

826
00:49:51,400 --> 00:49:54,051
No, the message is, "I'm down to fuck."

827
00:49:54,200 --> 00:49:56,851
- Okay.
- Or be fucked.

828
00:49:58,480 --> 00:50:01,927
Hey, Lon. I still don't know
why I'm here exactly.

829
00:50:02,080 --> 00:50:03,923
Why you're here?
I'll tell you why you're here.

830
00:50:04,080 --> 00:50:06,003
You're here because I want you

831
00:50:06,160 --> 00:50:08,527
to head up
our Internet and viral marketing.

832
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,040
You're offering me a job?

833
00:50:12,200 --> 00:50:13,804
I saw the Skeezy D video,

834
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:15,928
and it blew my fucking mind inside out!

835
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:17,411
I'm up all night. I can't sleep

836
00:50:17,560 --> 00:50:20,291
because I'm watching this video
over and over and over again,

837
00:50:20,440 --> 00:50:23,205
screaming at the TV,
"Just tell me what you want me to buy!"

838
00:50:24,680 --> 00:50:26,728
Yeah. Ooh, spank that monkey.

839
00:50:26,880 --> 00:50:28,803
Spank, spank that monkey, yeah.

840
00:50:30,120 --> 00:50:32,168
That's my niece.

841
00:50:32,320 --> 00:50:35,051
All right, so what kind of salary
are we talking?

842
00:50:35,200 --> 00:50:37,726
Okay. I can offer you 22.

843
00:50:37,880 --> 00:50:40,087
Ooh, that's not a lot.

844
00:50:41,080 --> 00:50:42,445
Will...

845
00:50:42,640 --> 00:50:46,008
We're marketing to kids that were doing
triple irony in kindergarten.

846
00:50:46,160 --> 00:50:47,889
And you...

847
00:50:48,040 --> 00:50:49,485
You are so fucking ironic,

848
00:50:49,640 --> 00:50:52,530
you've gone all the way around the track,
back to authentic.

849
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:57,126
You're irontic, man. You're irontic!

850
00:50:57,320 --> 00:50:58,481
"Irontic"?

851
00:50:59,880 --> 00:51:02,884
- Ding-dong! Going down.
- What are you doing?

852
00:51:03,080 --> 00:51:06,721
Will, if you told me to take
our entire marketing budget

853
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:10,726
and blow it on a billboard with nothing
but pictures of fat, veiny cocks, I'd do it!

854
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:12,331
I'll do whatever you say!

855
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,086
Tell me what to do, man.
Tell me what to do!

856
00:51:16,240 --> 00:51:17,287
Guess who's awesome?

857
00:51:17,440 --> 00:51:19,920
I am. Will is awesome. I did it.

858
00:51:20,080 --> 00:51:21,844
I stepped up, babe. I did exactly...

859
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:24,162
There you are. I did exactly
what you told me to do.

860
00:51:24,320 --> 00:51:26,641
I stepped up big time.
And I got great news for us.

861
00:51:26,800 --> 00:51:28,928
- I got fired.
- What?

862
00:51:30,920 --> 00:51:32,001
I got fired today.

863
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,083
They called me in to Human Resources,

864
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:37,483
and I thought I was getting promoted.
That's how stupid I am.

865
00:51:37,640 --> 00:51:39,290
You're not stupid.

866
00:51:40,680 --> 00:51:42,091
Yeah, I am.

867
00:51:43,240 --> 00:51:44,765
I'm $90,000 in debt.

868
00:51:44,920 --> 00:51:48,561
And I spent $779 on a pair of shoes!

869
00:51:48,720 --> 00:51:51,166
It's going to be okay.

870
00:51:51,320 --> 00:51:53,766
No, it's not.
How is this going to be okay?

871
00:51:53,960 --> 00:51:56,725
Because you're gonna...
You're gonna get another job.

872
00:52:01,960 --> 00:52:03,962
I'm sorry, Will...

873
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,922
What are you... What are we celebrating?

874
00:52:13,880 --> 00:52:16,929
Katherine is gonna
put me up for a promotion.

875
00:52:20,840 --> 00:52:23,047
That's great! That's great.

876
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,008
At least one of us has a career, right?

877
00:52:27,200 --> 00:52:28,531
Come here.

878
00:52:30,000 --> 00:52:31,365
That's great.

879
00:52:33,200 --> 00:52:35,009
What am I going to do for rent?

880
00:52:46,600 --> 00:52:48,011
Hey, roomie!

881
00:52:51,840 --> 00:52:55,208
FYI, we leave porn laying around,
so just, like, embrace it.

882
00:52:56,720 --> 00:52:58,643
The week started out bad.

883
00:52:58,800 --> 00:53:00,723
My severance ran out.
The mortgage was due.

884
00:53:00,880 --> 00:53:04,362
I pillaged my 401 (k). I was spiraling.

885
00:53:04,520 --> 00:53:08,002
And then on Tuesday,
I finally get an interview with Xerox.

886
00:53:09,160 --> 00:53:13,085
And I went in there and I killed.

887
00:53:13,240 --> 00:53:17,882
I mean, it was the kind of interview
that you dream about.

888
00:53:18,040 --> 00:53:23,080
And it was so good,
that I remember tearing up in the elevator.

889
00:53:23,240 --> 00:53:26,130
And I knew... I knew they were
gonna send me on to Gentry.

890
00:53:26,280 --> 00:53:29,329
I knew I was finally going to meet
the decision maker.

891
00:53:33,280 --> 00:53:36,250
And ever since then, nothing.

892
00:53:39,640 --> 00:53:41,290
Bupkis.

893
00:53:42,160 --> 00:53:44,162
I just need the bathroom key.

894
00:53:46,240 --> 00:53:47,685
Sorry.

895
00:53:51,400 --> 00:53:52,765
Cammy!

896
00:53:52,920 --> 00:53:54,809
How do I get to James Gentry?

897
00:53:55,000 --> 00:53:57,924
I've e-mailed, I've texted,
I've twittered.

898
00:53:58,080 --> 00:54:00,401
I've called his home. I spoke to his wife.

899
00:54:00,560 --> 00:54:01,925
You called his house?

900
00:54:02,080 --> 00:54:03,411
Well, the conversation was brief.

901
00:54:03,560 --> 00:54:05,005
It was dinner time. She had company.

902
00:54:05,160 --> 00:54:06,730
But I think I made an impression!

903
00:54:06,880 --> 00:54:08,882
Maybe you should focus
on more than one job listing.

904
00:54:09,040 --> 00:54:10,769
I'm so perfect for this job!

905
00:54:10,920 --> 00:54:12,922
I just have to get myself
in front of the guy

906
00:54:13,080 --> 00:54:15,924
who can actually pull the trigger
and hire me!

907
00:54:16,080 --> 00:54:18,162
It is ABC time!

908
00:54:18,320 --> 00:54:21,927
One way or another,
I've got to get to the decision maker.

909
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:24,128
- Yes.
- Whoa!

910
00:54:26,520 --> 00:54:30,047
James Gentry, prepare to meet Roger Davis.

911
00:54:35,120 --> 00:54:36,360
Yo.

912
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:39,046
Hey, man. Listen to my dad's latest tweet.

913
00:54:39,200 --> 00:54:40,326
"It ends today.

914
00:54:40,480 --> 00:54:43,609
"ABC, equal sign,
Annihilation Brings Closure.

915
00:54:43,800 --> 00:54:45,802
"Roger Davis,
symbol for greater than James Gentry."

916
00:54:45,960 --> 00:54:47,086
What the hell does that mean?

917
00:54:47,240 --> 00:54:49,129
I don't know, man, but it sounds ominous.

918
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:50,725
Yeah, it definitely doesn't sound good.

919
00:54:52,000 --> 00:54:54,401
Yeah, this is bad.
Look, Luke, we gotta go find my dad.

920
00:54:54,600 --> 00:54:55,840
All right, here I come.

921
00:54:57,400 --> 00:55:00,210
Yeah, it's Fifth and Spring,
right off the 101, big gray building.

922
00:55:08,480 --> 00:55:09,606
Excuse me, sir.

923
00:55:09,760 --> 00:55:11,046
Check in with the front desk, please.

924
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,730
Oh, right, right.

925
00:55:14,480 --> 00:55:17,609
All right.
I'll take care of that this afternoon.

926
00:55:17,760 --> 00:55:20,411
All right. All right, bye-bye.

927
00:55:21,560 --> 00:55:22,925
Good afternoon.

928
00:55:25,480 --> 00:55:27,881
Roger Davis here to see James Gentry.

929
00:55:28,040 --> 00:55:29,405
You could sign in.

930
00:55:32,120 --> 00:55:33,690
Sir?

931
00:55:35,600 --> 00:55:37,921
I'm going to need you
to exit the building.

932
00:55:41,920 --> 00:55:43,365
Okay.

933
00:55:48,280 --> 00:55:50,521
Or... how about this?

934
00:55:51,960 --> 00:55:56,284
How about I'm not going anywhere
until after I see the decision maker.

935
00:56:07,040 --> 00:56:08,201
Katherine?

936
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:11,009
- Mr. Wilheimer.
- Yeah.

937
00:56:11,160 --> 00:56:13,322
Look, family emergency.
I need to leave early.

938
00:56:13,480 --> 00:56:14,925
We're starting the Fredericks meeting.

939
00:56:15,080 --> 00:56:16,764
Okay. Well, how important is it
that I'm there?

940
00:56:16,920 --> 00:56:18,763
How important is keeping your job?

941
00:56:20,280 --> 00:56:22,362
Katherine, I'm sorry. My dad needs me.

942
00:56:23,560 --> 00:56:25,483
Nearest exit, everybody!

943
00:56:31,880 --> 00:56:32,881
Go, mi amigo.

944
00:56:33,040 --> 00:56:35,407
Wait, did you pull that for me?

945
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:37,244
Go to tu papa.

946
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,440
- Hurry up!
- He's at Millennium Plaza.

947
00:56:52,920 --> 00:56:54,126
How do you know?

948
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,242
iStalkU, motherfucker!

949
00:57:07,200 --> 00:57:10,204
You can't wait here, sir.
Why don't you find a Starbucks?

950
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,801
Why don't you find a suck-my-cock-bucks?

951
00:57:14,640 --> 00:57:18,122
Sorry. That was uncalled for.

952
00:57:19,000 --> 00:57:20,490
Where are we going?

953
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,688
It's saying he's, like, around...

954
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:27,371
I shouldn't have said what I said.

955
00:57:27,520 --> 00:57:30,171
But I'd like to let you know
that if you call Pearl,

956
00:57:30,320 --> 00:57:32,641
Pearl knows me and you just tell her...

957
00:57:32,840 --> 00:57:35,002
Hey, hey! That's my dad.

958
00:57:35,160 --> 00:57:37,049
- Will?
- Whatever he did, if you just let him go,

959
00:57:37,200 --> 00:57:39,567
I promise I'll get him home safely.

960
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:42,451
Look, please, sir.
Don't embarrass him anymore.

961
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:44,526
Please.

962
00:57:50,200 --> 00:57:51,725
Go on, Mr. Davis.

963
00:57:51,880 --> 00:57:53,086
Thank you.

964
00:57:58,240 --> 00:58:01,210
Wait a minute. That's... That's Gentry.

965
00:58:01,360 --> 00:58:04,807
That's him. That's the decision maker.

966
00:58:37,640 --> 00:58:38,846
Dad!

967
00:58:45,160 --> 00:58:46,161
Go!

968
00:58:51,360 --> 00:58:53,488
I was captain of my Ultimate Frisbee team.

969
00:58:53,640 --> 00:58:54,880
Shut up!

970
00:58:55,040 --> 00:58:57,361
Hold it. Hold it!

971
00:58:57,520 --> 00:58:59,568
Hold it, hold it. Thank you.

972
00:58:59,760 --> 00:59:01,649
No! Oh!

973
00:59:01,800 --> 00:59:03,131
Hold it, hold on!

974
00:59:11,400 --> 00:59:13,209
Mr. Gentry, my name is Roger Davis.

975
00:59:14,320 --> 00:59:16,049
Stay away from me. I'll call security.

976
00:59:16,240 --> 00:59:17,844
They know I'm here.

977
00:59:18,000 --> 00:59:20,890
Now, sir. I know you must think
that I'm psychotic.

978
00:59:21,040 --> 00:59:23,247
I'm not psychotic. I'm not.

979
00:59:23,400 --> 00:59:26,131
I'm just a man driven to desperation

980
00:59:26,280 --> 00:59:30,330
by months and months
of rejection and indifference.

981
00:59:31,160 --> 00:59:32,685
I'm a human being,

982
00:59:32,880 --> 00:59:35,326
asking for an opportunity
to tell you face to face

983
00:59:35,480 --> 00:59:39,565
why I think I would be great
for your company.

984
00:59:42,760 --> 00:59:45,570
This is my resume. My son made this.

985
00:59:47,520 --> 00:59:49,522
Why me?

986
00:59:50,880 --> 00:59:54,282
Because you, sir, are the decision maker.

987
01:00:05,440 --> 01:00:07,363
What happened?

988
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,484
I got an interview.

989
01:00:10,640 --> 01:00:13,140
Yeah!

990
01:00:13,240 --> 01:00:14,890
- Nice!
- All right!

991
01:00:18,040 --> 01:00:19,883
- Yes!
- There we go.

992
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,124
There can be only one.

993
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:51,442
- Hey.
- Hey.

994
01:01:55,560 --> 01:01:57,244
Katherine wants to see you in her office.

995
01:01:57,440 --> 01:01:58,726
Fuck.

996
01:02:01,720 --> 01:02:03,290
Goodbye head?

997
01:02:03,440 --> 01:02:06,603
What? No. What is wrong with you?

998
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:11,123
I'm really bored.

999
01:02:23,480 --> 01:02:25,562
Isn't it a glorious day?

1000
01:02:26,920 --> 01:02:28,251
What's glorious about it?

1001
01:02:28,400 --> 01:02:30,971
I've rid this company of the dead wood.

1002
01:02:31,120 --> 01:02:32,610
We are leaner and meaner.

1003
01:02:34,040 --> 01:02:37,601
This is a contract.

1004
01:02:39,160 --> 01:02:40,605
It's a what?

1005
01:02:41,680 --> 01:02:44,001
You're now Vice President
of Corporate Communications.

1006
01:02:44,160 --> 01:02:48,245
Your salary is $52,000.

1007
01:02:50,040 --> 01:02:51,246
52,000?

1008
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:55,086
You'll be doing the work of three people.
Get used to eating dinner at your desk.

1009
01:02:57,320 --> 01:03:00,927
Now that I've turned you around,
it was easier to kick you upstairs

1010
01:03:01,080 --> 01:03:03,128
than to train someone new.

1011
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:05,851
Just don't forget who did the kicking.

1012
01:03:07,320 --> 01:03:09,049
- Yeah.
- Come here.

1013
01:03:15,640 --> 01:03:18,644
I own you, Mr. Davis.

1014
01:03:24,760 --> 01:03:27,923
Get to work, VP.

1015
01:03:51,920 --> 01:03:53,445
Yes!

1016
01:03:58,640 --> 01:04:00,051
Why are you massaging my girlfriend?

1017
01:04:00,200 --> 01:04:02,009
Don't break her concentration.

1018
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:04,128
She's about to get
to the Living Legend achievement.

1019
01:04:04,280 --> 01:04:06,044
This is fucking crazy, man!
She's on a killing spree.

1020
01:04:06,200 --> 01:04:07,201
Killing frenzy.

1021
01:04:07,400 --> 01:04:10,483
- Your girlfriend is a fucking prodigy, bro.
- Bong me.

1022
01:04:12,000 --> 01:04:13,968
You light it. Light it for her.

1023
01:04:14,160 --> 01:04:16,561
"Bong me"? Hey, what's up with you, man?

1024
01:04:16,720 --> 01:04:19,371
I lost a half a million dollars today.

1025
01:04:21,440 --> 01:04:24,649
I am fucked. I let everybody down, dude.

1026
01:04:24,800 --> 01:04:27,041
I let Tyler Perry down.

1027
01:04:27,200 --> 01:04:29,089
Oprah, Barack Obama...

1028
01:04:29,240 --> 01:04:31,368
I let Barack Obama down. I am fucked, man.

1029
01:04:31,520 --> 01:04:34,205
- Stay with it.
- I'm on it.

1030
01:04:34,360 --> 01:04:36,124
You guys don't understand, man.

1031
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:39,727
You guys don't understand.
I drank deer cum!

1032
01:04:39,880 --> 01:04:41,848
- Move!
- Oh, God. Shit!

1033
01:04:42,000 --> 01:04:43,604
Hey, Jillian, can I talk to you
for a second?

1034
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,808
- Boo!
- No.

1035
01:04:45,960 --> 01:04:47,405
Okay. All right.

1036
01:04:48,720 --> 01:04:50,563
Game over, bitches!

1037
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,210
What are you doing? You can't do that.

1038
01:04:52,360 --> 01:04:53,340
You can't pull the cord out.
Why are you doing that?

1039
01:04:53,440 --> 01:04:55,681
- Boo!
- Don't boo me.

1040
01:04:55,840 --> 01:04:57,808
You don't... Don't boo. Stop booing me!

1041
01:04:57,960 --> 01:04:59,849
I'm surprised at you, Will.

1042
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:03,600
Dude, get out of here.

1043
01:05:04,720 --> 01:05:06,529
Sudden trauma can hurt the LED.

1044
01:05:08,160 --> 01:05:10,447
Wait, come here.
Save me, save me, save me! I don't...

1045
01:05:11,080 --> 01:05:13,447
- Bong me.
- Bong coming in.

1046
01:05:13,600 --> 01:05:16,331
All right, Jillian. I need you to step up.

1047
01:05:18,240 --> 01:05:19,810
Oh, my God.

1048
01:05:32,440 --> 01:05:34,249
Bring home the bacon, baby.

1049
01:05:34,400 --> 01:05:36,926
Oh, fuck. Let's eat some bacon right now.

1050
01:05:49,240 --> 01:05:50,685
Mr. Diller?

1051
01:05:53,000 --> 01:05:55,810
I just want to say I'm sorry I screwed up.

1052
01:05:55,960 --> 01:05:59,681
And thank you for the opportunity and...

1053
01:06:03,080 --> 01:06:04,809
I'm sorry I let you down.

1054
01:06:10,080 --> 01:06:12,082
Where in the fuck
do you think you're going?

1055
01:06:13,360 --> 01:06:15,601
Sit the fuck down.

1056
01:06:17,240 --> 01:06:20,244
What kind of fucking pussy generation
do you come from, anyway?

1057
01:06:21,440 --> 01:06:23,044
You never apologize.

1058
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:25,726
Never, ever.
You burn the fucking house down,

1059
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:28,008
you roll up your fucking sleeves
and you build another one.

1060
01:06:28,160 --> 01:06:30,401
Now, get the fuck back out there
and make the money back.

1061
01:06:30,560 --> 01:06:32,688
You got it?

1062
01:06:32,880 --> 01:06:34,245
Go.

1063
01:06:38,720 --> 01:06:42,167
Yo, this will never happen again.

1064
01:06:42,320 --> 01:06:43,401
Thank you so much.

1065
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:48,531
Goddamn it.

1066
01:06:49,920 --> 01:06:51,490
Send the fucking custodian in.

1067
01:07:12,200 --> 01:07:14,567
Bring it in. Okay, circle up.

1068
01:07:15,200 --> 01:07:18,727
All right. Now, I know
we haven't won a game yet,

1069
01:07:18,880 --> 01:07:21,690
but we have been losing by less and less.

1070
01:07:21,840 --> 01:07:24,889
And I know for a fact that
their two best players have head lice.

1071
01:07:26,120 --> 01:07:28,487
I'm saying we have a chance today.

1072
01:07:29,440 --> 01:07:31,169
A chance for victory.

1073
01:07:32,280 --> 01:07:33,725
A chance for redemption.

1074
01:07:36,520 --> 01:07:37,965
Hands in.

1075
01:07:38,120 --> 01:07:40,009
Victory on three.

1076
01:07:40,200 --> 01:07:43,409
One, two, three. Victory!

1077
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:51,000
Great season!
You guys played your hearts out.

1078
01:07:51,160 --> 01:07:52,924
You did it.

1079
01:07:55,360 --> 01:07:58,364
Everybody is a winner.

1080
01:07:59,120 --> 01:08:02,010
We are so proud of you.

1081
01:08:02,160 --> 01:08:04,083
Next year, no scoreboard, right?

1082
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,163
All right. Here you go, honey.

1083
01:08:06,320 --> 01:08:08,084
No, no, no. No trophies!

1084
01:08:09,240 --> 01:08:10,651
No trophies this year.

1085
01:08:10,800 --> 01:08:12,290
We always get trophies.

1086
01:08:12,480 --> 01:08:15,051
Trophies don't mean anything
unless you earn them.

1087
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,929
They're just plastic junk.

1088
01:08:17,760 --> 01:08:19,125
Look.

1089
01:08:20,960 --> 01:08:22,371
No!

1090
01:08:22,520 --> 01:08:26,411
My childhood bedroom
is filled to the brim with trophies,

1091
01:08:26,560 --> 01:08:28,927
and I haven't won a thing in my life.

1092
01:08:29,120 --> 01:08:31,327
You would have to be born
already in a coma

1093
01:08:31,480 --> 01:08:33,369
to do as little with your life as I have.

1094
01:08:33,520 --> 01:08:35,921
- Excuse me.
- Stop it, stop! Listen to me.

1095
01:08:36,080 --> 01:08:37,241
Listen, guys.

1096
01:08:38,080 --> 01:08:39,081
Listen to me.

1097
01:08:40,720 --> 01:08:43,849
Now, I've spent the last
five years of my life

1098
01:08:44,000 --> 01:08:46,890
practically living on a cum-stained couch.

1099
01:08:48,600 --> 01:08:51,683
I smoke $200 of weed a week.

1100
01:08:54,080 --> 01:08:56,082
I've been wearing the same
pair of socks for so long

1101
01:08:56,240 --> 01:08:58,720
that the fabric of the sock
has literally become one

1102
01:08:58,880 --> 01:09:00,609
with the skin of my little toe.

1103
01:09:00,760 --> 01:09:03,001
And why? Why?

1104
01:09:05,240 --> 01:09:06,605
Because when I was growing up,

1105
01:09:06,760 --> 01:09:09,445
they gave me trophies for losing.

1106
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:11,090
Do you understand what I'm saying?

1107
01:09:12,560 --> 01:09:14,642
No trophy, Sam.

1108
01:09:18,200 --> 01:09:20,009
Kwan, no trophies!

1109
01:09:20,640 --> 01:09:23,484
No trophies!

1110
01:09:41,520 --> 01:09:42,760
Thanks, Charlie.

1111
01:09:44,960 --> 01:09:47,281
Don't call me Charlie.

1112
01:09:47,440 --> 01:09:49,090
Call me Coach.

1113
01:10:03,400 --> 01:10:05,528
- This place is foul.
- I know.

1114
01:10:06,720 --> 01:10:09,041
- There's porn everywhere.
- I know.

1115
01:10:12,040 --> 01:10:14,281
Look, this is just temporary.

1116
01:10:14,480 --> 01:10:16,209
I got a good steady job now.

1117
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:19,170
I mean, I don't want to jinx it,

1118
01:10:19,360 --> 01:10:22,523
but they're talking about
Employee of the Month.

1119
01:10:22,680 --> 01:10:25,445
I don't think that's a thing
that people do anymore.

1120
01:10:25,600 --> 01:10:27,887
It is. And I'm gonna get it.

1121
01:10:28,040 --> 01:10:29,121
For us.

1122
01:10:35,080 --> 01:10:36,684
What I'm saying is, it's gonna be okay.

1123
01:10:55,560 --> 01:10:57,085
Oh, Will...

1124
01:10:57,240 --> 01:10:58,571
Is this your girlfriend?

1125
01:10:58,720 --> 01:11:01,485
Jillian, this is Katherine Dunn.

1126
01:11:01,640 --> 01:11:03,563
- Hello.
- Hi, Jillian.

1127
01:11:03,720 --> 01:11:08,362
I think that Jillian
should be thanking me, don't you?

1128
01:11:08,520 --> 01:11:10,249
- Thanking you for what?
- For what?

1129
01:11:10,400 --> 01:11:12,368
For what?

1130
01:11:12,520 --> 01:11:18,163
For turning you into the responsible
little worker bee that you are.

1131
01:11:20,120 --> 01:11:22,691
- It was very nice to meet you.
- You, too.

1132
01:11:22,880 --> 01:11:24,291
Enjoy the party, dears.

1133
01:11:28,400 --> 01:11:30,482
- Wow.
- I know.

1134
01:11:30,680 --> 01:11:33,286
But she's making me Vice President.

1135
01:11:37,000 --> 01:11:40,049
All signed. Just got to turn it in.

1136
01:11:46,120 --> 01:11:48,043
Where did you find that?

1137
01:11:48,240 --> 01:11:51,528
I called Lon Zimmet.

1138
01:11:53,160 --> 01:11:54,650
He went on and on about you,

1139
01:11:54,800 --> 01:11:57,167
and used the word "cock"
like, 1,000 times.

1140
01:11:57,320 --> 01:11:58,970
Yeah, he does that.

1141
01:12:02,560 --> 01:12:04,289
I need to say something.

1142
01:12:04,440 --> 01:12:06,204
What?

1143
01:12:09,920 --> 01:12:11,809
I'm 22 years old and I have no idea

1144
01:12:11,960 --> 01:12:14,042
what I'm gonna do
with the rest of my life.

1145
01:12:14,800 --> 01:12:18,009
And I'm fine with that.
I have a lot to offer the world,

1146
01:12:18,160 --> 01:12:21,209
and this is just the beginning,
and if you want to take a job

1147
01:12:21,360 --> 01:12:23,601
with some shady start-up company
that has nothing to offer you

1148
01:12:23,760 --> 01:12:26,445
but stock options and a dream,
then you should do that!

1149
01:12:28,000 --> 01:12:29,968
Yeah, you know,
maybe we're not all geniuses.

1150
01:12:30,120 --> 01:12:32,248
So we're not the greatest generation,
so what?

1151
01:12:32,400 --> 01:12:35,324
These are our lives,
and we're gonna make the most of 'em!

1152
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:42,089
I love you, Jillian.

1153
01:12:47,360 --> 01:12:49,840
Come on, come on. Don't be shy.

1154
01:13:01,560 --> 01:13:03,642
Hey, Katherine,
can I talk to you for a second?

1155
01:13:03,800 --> 01:13:04,847
Sure.

1156
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,526
So, I wanted to thank you
for this opportunity.

1157
01:13:07,680 --> 01:13:11,048
- Oh, pleasure.
- But yeah, the job, it's not really for me.

1158
01:13:12,680 --> 01:13:16,207
- You're joking.
- No. I quit.

1159
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:19,241
Wow.

1160
01:13:20,560 --> 01:13:21,800
Cocky little shit.

1161
01:13:22,720 --> 01:13:25,803
What, are you gonna go play house
with that ugly little girlfriend of yours?

1162
01:13:26,000 --> 01:13:27,206
- Maybe I will.
- Maybe you will.

1163
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:30,682
But let me tell you something.
You won't, because you won't have a job.

1164
01:13:30,880 --> 01:13:34,566
So I want you to be prepared for what it
feels like to be on the unemployment line.

1165
01:13:34,760 --> 01:13:38,526
Because as of this moment forward,
I'm going to do everything in my power

1166
01:13:38,720 --> 01:13:41,300
to ensure that you never work
in this town again.

1167
01:13:41,400 --> 01:13:43,721
Hey, put that in your Facebook.

1168
01:14:15,120 --> 01:14:17,300
- Should I put my showcase here?
- Yeah, would you?

1169
01:14:17,400 --> 01:14:19,687
I found this working late one night,

1170
01:14:19,840 --> 01:14:23,049
and I thought it was
a good opportunity to express myself.

1171
01:14:30,400 --> 01:14:31,640
Merry Christmas.

1172
01:14:34,160 --> 01:14:35,764
Take that minotaur cock.

1173
01:14:51,240 --> 01:14:54,767
Is it tough out there? No doubt.

1174
01:14:56,640 --> 01:14:59,564
But we all need a job. So, what do you do?

1175
01:15:00,240 --> 01:15:01,810
Chug, chug, chug!

1176
01:15:01,960 --> 01:15:04,281
Find the thing that you were meant to do.

1177
01:15:06,320 --> 01:15:08,049
Work your ass off to get it.

1178
01:15:11,360 --> 01:15:13,010
Never stop believing.

1179
01:15:14,360 --> 01:15:16,169
Never quit.

1180
01:15:38,160 --> 01:15:40,561
Hello. Skeezy D blowin' up the Internet.

1181
01:15:40,680 --> 01:15:44,162
Everybody rollin' up to me like,
"How can I roll Skeezy-style?"

1182
01:15:45,640 --> 01:15:47,005
Well, look.

1183
01:15:50,040 --> 01:15:51,849
Sweat.

1184
01:15:52,000 --> 01:15:53,843
Get your fuck on.

1185
01:15:54,720 --> 01:15:56,529
It's a dick!

1186
01:15:57,880 --> 01:16:00,281
Fucking great!

1187
01:16:01,160 --> 01:16:05,563
Will, I'd like to officially welcome you
to the Sweat team.

1188
01:16:05,720 --> 01:16:08,007
Thanks, Lon.

1189
01:16:08,160 --> 01:16:09,889
But I'm gonna have to
turn down your offer.

1190
01:16:10,080 --> 01:16:13,004
- What?
- I've started my own production company,

1191
01:16:13,160 --> 01:16:16,164
but I would be honored
to have Sweat as my first client.

1192
01:16:19,720 --> 01:16:20,767
Yeah.

1193
01:16:25,880 --> 01:16:28,963
In other words, don't just feel special.

1194
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:31,720
Be special.

1195
01:16:39,160 --> 01:16:42,209
Do you love your wife? Of course you do.

1196
01:16:42,360 --> 01:16:44,124
But when she tells you
she's going shopping,

1197
01:16:44,280 --> 01:16:47,921
how do you know she's not actually
going to a sordid motel like this one?

01:16:48,120 --> 01:16:49,451
- Hello, lover.
- Hello.

1199
01:16:56,920 --> 01:16:58,968
Your husband says he's working late.

1200
01:16:59,120 --> 01:17:01,487
Well, what kind of work
are we really talking about?

1201
01:17:03,840 --> 01:17:06,320
Hey, Jezebel, sin.

1202
01:17:12,240 --> 01:17:16,609
Come and join the more
than 150,000 satisfied customers

1203
01:17:16,760 --> 01:17:19,411
who have all used iStalkU.

1204
01:17:19,560 --> 01:17:21,324
Let your loved ones know you care

1205
01:17:21,480 --> 01:17:23,881
by never letting them
out of your virtual sight.

1206
01:17:31,760 --> 01:17:33,364
And cut!

1207
01:17:55,520 --> 01:17:56,646
- We got it.
- All right!
