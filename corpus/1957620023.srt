1
00:00:10,644 --> 00:00:12,413
JJ (VOICEOVER): Friendship
is a very delicate word,

2
00:00:12,513 --> 00:00:17,151
with various definitions, each
holding its own personal value.

3
00:00:17,251 --> 00:00:19,120
Webster's definition
is, "one attached

4
00:00:19,220 --> 00:00:21,755
to another by personal regard."

5
00:00:21,855 --> 00:00:24,592
This is ours.

6
00:00:24,692 --> 00:00:28,596
[music playing]

7
00:02:07,561 --> 00:02:09,163
JJ (VOICEOVER): Spanish Harlem.

8
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:10,564
I was born here.

9
00:02:10,664 --> 00:02:14,268
That's where I spent the
first 12 years of my life.

10
00:02:14,368 --> 00:02:16,170
My name is Juan Jose Lopez.

11
00:02:16,270 --> 00:02:17,571
I'm a Puerto Rican.

12
00:02:17,671 --> 00:02:18,572
And that's my mom.

13
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,474
She was born in Puerto
Rico and raised.

14
00:02:20,574 --> 00:02:22,710
She immigrated here
for a better life.

15
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,778
My father, I never knew him.

16
00:02:24,878 --> 00:02:26,380
Mom never spoke much about him.

17
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,418
Alls I knew was that he was
gunned down in a drug deal.

18
00:02:30,518 --> 00:02:32,520
It was just my mom
and I. She was a very

19
00:02:32,620 --> 00:02:34,555
proud woman and a hard worker.

20
00:02:34,655 --> 00:02:36,490
She always wanted a
better life for us.

21
00:02:36,590 --> 00:02:39,527
Today, all her hard work
had finally paid off.

22
00:02:39,627 --> 00:02:41,829
She had saved enough money
to move us out of Harlem

23
00:02:41,929 --> 00:02:44,565
and move us up to the
Bronx, which is OK by me.

24
00:02:44,665 --> 00:02:48,402
It just put me closer
to Yankee Stadium.

25
00:02:48,502 --> 00:02:53,374
187th Street and Belmont Avenue,
this would be my new home.

26
00:02:53,474 --> 00:02:56,410
We moved on a block which had
about 30 kids, mostly Italian,

27
00:02:56,510 --> 00:02:59,380
some Irish, couple of Jews,
and one Puerto Rican--

28
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,281
me.

29
00:03:04,218 --> 00:03:05,819
This would be the
first time I met Joey

30
00:03:05,919 --> 00:03:08,055
Esposito and Louie Mazzarino.

31
00:03:08,155 --> 00:03:09,323
It was in the cards
that the three of us

32
00:03:09,423 --> 00:03:10,924
would become true friends.

33
00:03:22,803 --> 00:03:24,972
Beautiful, now we got Puerto
Ricans living over here.

34
00:03:25,072 --> 00:03:26,974
We're moving to Yonkers.

35
00:03:27,074 --> 00:03:27,908
Your mother made gravy.

36
00:03:28,008 --> 00:03:28,876
Come on upstairs.

37
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,578
Just one more hand, dad.

38
00:03:30,678 --> 00:03:31,712
What'd I say?

39
00:03:31,812 --> 00:03:32,613
Now!

40
00:03:37,818 --> 00:03:40,421
What did I tell you about
that goddamn landlord?

41
00:03:40,521 --> 00:03:42,723
They don't give a shit about us.

42
00:03:42,823 --> 00:03:44,958
He don't care we been
paying rent here 14 years.

43
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:47,628
All he cares about is money.

44
00:03:47,728 --> 00:03:49,263
He rents to spics.

45
00:03:49,363 --> 00:03:50,831
I met her in the hallway.

46
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,999
They seemed like nice people.

47
00:03:52,099 --> 00:03:53,233
Nice people?

48
00:03:53,334 --> 00:03:54,268
Where they from?

49
00:03:54,368 --> 00:03:56,904
They moved here from Harlem.

50
00:03:57,004 --> 00:03:58,138
Nice people?

51
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,873
There are no nice
people from Harlem.

52
00:03:59,973 --> 00:04:01,909
Only animals.

53
00:04:02,009 --> 00:04:04,612
We're moving to Yonkers.

54
00:04:04,712 --> 00:04:07,915
Dad, can I go play stickball?

55
00:04:08,015 --> 00:04:09,950
You didn't finish.

56
00:04:10,050 --> 00:04:10,918
I'm full.

57
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,686
Oh, you're full?

58
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:15,188
When I was your age, we
ate maybe once a day,

59
00:04:15,289 --> 00:04:16,390
and not food like this.

60
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:17,858
We ate a meal like
this once a week.

61
00:04:17,958 --> 00:04:21,829
I mean, you people around
here, you eat like kings.

62
00:04:21,929 --> 00:04:23,297
And you know why?

63
00:04:23,397 --> 00:04:25,299
Because I break my ass all
week doing construction so

64
00:04:25,399 --> 00:04:26,734
yous can eat food like this.

65
00:04:26,834 --> 00:04:29,603
Carmine, for Christ's
sake, it's macaroni.

66
00:04:29,703 --> 00:04:30,938
Costs a quarter.

67
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:32,272
Let him go.

68
00:04:32,373 --> 00:04:34,308
That's not the point, Fran.

69
00:04:34,408 --> 00:04:35,643
He should learn
to respect money.

70
00:04:40,381 --> 00:04:41,349
Go ahead, go.

71
00:04:41,449 --> 00:04:42,616
Be back by six.

72
00:04:42,716 --> 00:04:44,518
And stay away from
that Puerto Rican kid.

73
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:48,922
Did you eat enough?
Are you full?

74
00:04:49,022 --> 00:04:50,123
Yes, mommy.

75
00:04:50,223 --> 00:04:52,893
You make the best
chicken and rice.

76
00:04:52,993 --> 00:04:54,828
[non-english]

77
00:05:00,768 --> 00:05:01,569
I'm scared.

78
00:05:01,669 --> 00:05:03,036
What are you scared about?

79
00:05:03,136 --> 00:05:04,738
Everything's different here.

80
00:05:04,838 --> 00:05:07,541
I don't know anyone,
and I miss my friends.

81
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:11,579
I'm scared, too.

82
00:05:11,679 --> 00:05:13,847
You're scared, too, mommy?

83
00:05:13,947 --> 00:05:15,349
Yes.

84
00:05:15,449 --> 00:05:17,918
Don't be scared, momma.
I'll protect you.

85
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:22,390
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Stickball was the most

86
00:05:22,490 --> 00:05:24,257
popular sport in New York City.

87
00:05:24,358 --> 00:05:26,259
Whether you were in
Harlem or up in the Bronx,

88
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:28,496
there was a pickup
game on every corner.

89
00:05:28,596 --> 00:05:30,898
As I watched, my heart
pounded with excitement.

90
00:05:30,998 --> 00:05:35,403
I wanted to play, but they
didn't even notice I was there.

91
00:05:35,503 --> 00:05:38,071
Joey was by far the best
athlete in the neighborhood.

92
00:05:38,171 --> 00:05:39,373
He could play any position.

93
00:05:39,473 --> 00:05:40,808
And man, was he a great hitter.

94
00:05:43,377 --> 00:05:45,579
Louie was a great pitcher.

95
00:05:45,679 --> 00:05:49,517
He had all kinds of
junk on his ball.

96
00:05:49,617 --> 00:05:51,351
That's Nicky Tomatoes.

97
00:05:51,452 --> 00:05:54,655
His family owned a food
stand in the neighborhood.

98
00:05:54,755 --> 00:05:57,324
He was the worst
hitter I ever saw.

99
00:05:57,425 --> 00:05:59,092
He couldn't hit water if
he jumped out of a boat.

100
00:06:03,564 --> 00:06:06,434
There's tomato juice
all over the bat.

101
00:06:06,534 --> 00:06:08,469
JJ (VOICEOVER): Bubbles
Cardillo, at 12 years old,

102
00:06:08,569 --> 00:06:10,704
he weighed over 200 pounds.

103
00:06:10,804 --> 00:06:12,239
The only belt that
could hold his pants up

104
00:06:12,339 --> 00:06:13,641
was the Belt Parkway.

105
00:06:13,741 --> 00:06:16,877
He was the slowest
moving human I ever met.

106
00:06:16,977 --> 00:06:17,911
Hold, hold!

107
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:18,846
Hold!

108
00:06:21,682 --> 00:06:23,451
I told you to hold!

109
00:06:23,551 --> 00:06:24,952
Pay up or asses up.

110
00:06:27,921 --> 00:06:29,256
Pay up or asses up!

111
00:06:29,356 --> 00:06:31,258
I ain't got no money!

112
00:06:31,358 --> 00:06:34,595
Asses up, come on!

113
00:06:34,695 --> 00:06:36,830
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Pay up or asses up.

114
00:06:36,930 --> 00:06:39,166
We never had to pay in Harlem
because we had no money.

115
00:06:39,266 --> 00:06:40,768
Shit.

116
00:06:40,868 --> 00:06:42,936
JJ (VOICEOVER): I heard of asses
up, but never with your pants

117
00:06:43,036 --> 00:06:43,637
down.

118
00:06:43,737 --> 00:06:45,773
That must really hurt.

119
00:06:45,873 --> 00:06:46,707
Nail him.

120
00:06:50,978 --> 00:06:51,679
Ow!

121
00:06:51,779 --> 00:06:53,647
JOEY: Look at that, [laugh].

122
00:06:53,747 --> 00:06:55,749
Let him a big red mark.

123
00:06:55,849 --> 00:06:58,185
LOUIE: Hey, there goes
that Puerto Rican kid.

124
00:06:58,285 --> 00:06:59,186
What's his name?

125
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,420
Juan, I think.

126
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:02,255
LOUIE: He's been
watching us all game.

127
00:07:02,355 --> 00:07:04,191
You want to go talk to him?

128
00:07:04,291 --> 00:07:06,527
Nah, my dad said to stay away.

129
00:07:06,627 --> 00:07:08,496
We're moving to Yonkers.

130
00:07:08,596 --> 00:07:10,698
Where is Yonkers?

131
00:07:10,798 --> 00:07:13,601
I'm not sure, but
I think it's far.

132
00:07:19,640 --> 00:07:21,909
There's my favorite guy, hm.

133
00:07:22,009 --> 00:07:22,843
How was your day?

134
00:07:22,943 --> 00:07:24,845
It was OK.

135
00:07:24,945 --> 00:07:26,046
What'd you do?

136
00:07:26,146 --> 00:07:27,481
I watched a game.

137
00:07:27,581 --> 00:07:29,216
Did you make any new friends?

138
00:07:29,316 --> 00:07:30,217
Not yet, mom.

139
00:07:30,317 --> 00:07:32,019
Good night.

140
00:07:32,119 --> 00:07:34,488
Baby, don't forget
to brush your teeth

141
00:07:34,588 --> 00:07:35,623
and say your prayers.

142
00:07:45,566 --> 00:07:48,035
Dear god, please
bless my mom and please

143
00:07:48,135 --> 00:07:50,403
bless all my friends
in my old apartment,

144
00:07:50,504 --> 00:07:52,606
especially my cousin Carlos.

145
00:07:52,706 --> 00:07:56,043
Please protect me in this new
place and in my new school.

146
00:07:56,143 --> 00:07:57,845
And say hello to my dad.

147
00:07:57,945 --> 00:08:00,213
Amen.

148
00:08:00,313 --> 00:08:01,682
Oh, yeah, don't
forget the Yankees.

149
00:08:01,782 --> 00:08:02,983
They need a lot
of help this year.

150
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,622
CARMINE: No way!

151
00:08:08,722 --> 00:08:10,490
FRANCES: Would you please
keep your voice down?

152
00:08:10,591 --> 00:08:12,025
I don't want the
whole neighborhood

153
00:08:12,125 --> 00:08:13,260
to know our business!

154
00:08:13,360 --> 00:08:14,461
CARMINE: This is my house!

155
00:08:14,562 --> 00:08:16,163
I'll yell all I want!

156
00:08:16,263 --> 00:08:17,430
They don't have to listen!

157
00:08:17,531 --> 00:08:19,032
FRANCES: Just this
once, could we please

158
00:08:19,132 --> 00:08:21,669
go somewhere as a family?

159
00:08:21,769 --> 00:08:25,205
Dear god, please
love my mom and dad.

160
00:08:25,305 --> 00:08:28,876
And help fix my dad's temper
so he won't yell as much.

161
00:08:28,976 --> 00:08:32,846
Please bless my sister,
Louie, and all my friends.

162
00:08:32,946 --> 00:08:35,415
Amen.

163
00:08:35,515 --> 00:08:38,251
Oh, yeah, don't
forget the Yankees.

164
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:41,021
Amen.

165
00:08:41,121 --> 00:08:42,322
[bell ringing]

166
00:08:42,422 --> 00:08:43,924
JJ (VOICEOVER): It was my
first day at my new school.

167
00:08:44,024 --> 00:08:45,626
It was actually
going pretty good

168
00:08:45,726 --> 00:08:47,828
until I ran into Johnny Ryan.

169
00:08:47,928 --> 00:08:49,396
Hey, chico.

170
00:08:49,496 --> 00:08:51,264
Do you know who I am?

171
00:08:51,364 --> 00:08:52,199
No.

172
00:08:52,299 --> 00:08:53,801
No?

173
00:08:53,901 --> 00:08:56,103
Well, I'm the one who you give
your lunch money to every day.

174
00:08:56,203 --> 00:08:58,572
There I was, my first
day at my new school,

175
00:08:58,672 --> 00:09:00,874
and this kid wanted
my lunch money.

176
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:04,377
I felt all alone, but I was
willing to stand my ground.

177
00:09:04,477 --> 00:09:06,113
You gotta take it from me.

178
00:09:06,213 --> 00:09:07,347
- OK.
- Get off me!

179
00:09:07,447 --> 00:09:08,348
Ow, geez!

180
00:09:08,448 --> 00:09:09,316
Come on!

181
00:09:09,416 --> 00:09:10,517
Come on, get off of me!

182
00:09:10,618 --> 00:09:11,451
Hey, get off of him!

183
00:09:11,551 --> 00:09:12,352
Come on!

184
00:09:12,452 --> 00:09:13,621
Move!
Get off of him.

185
00:09:13,721 --> 00:09:14,888
Get off him.

186
00:09:14,988 --> 00:09:16,489
Hey, it's between
me and him, Esposito.

187
00:09:16,590 --> 00:09:18,225
It's not fair.
You jumped him.

188
00:09:18,325 --> 00:09:20,093
It's only six on one.

189
00:09:20,193 --> 00:09:21,662
Now it's three on six.

190
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,163
Shit, here we go again.

191
00:09:25,899 --> 00:09:28,068
I'm not through
with you yet, spic.

192
00:09:28,168 --> 00:09:30,003
Let's go.

193
00:09:30,103 --> 00:09:32,005
JJ (VOICEOVER): From that
moment on, the three of us

194
00:09:32,105 --> 00:09:33,206
were inseparable.

195
00:09:33,306 --> 00:09:34,708
We all shared a strong bond.

196
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,477
But Joey, he was special,
kind of like the big brother

197
00:09:37,577 --> 00:09:38,378
I never had.

198
00:09:38,478 --> 00:09:39,379
You OK?

199
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,313
Yeah.

200
00:09:40,413 --> 00:09:41,581
OK, take care.

201
00:09:51,859 --> 00:09:53,293
Hey, we're going for pizza.

202
00:09:53,393 --> 00:09:55,062
You wanna come?

203
00:09:55,162 --> 00:09:57,931
Sure.

204
00:09:58,031 --> 00:09:58,899
Come on.

205
00:10:03,270 --> 00:10:04,171
Hey, ma.

206
00:10:04,271 --> 00:10:05,505
Where you been?

207
00:10:05,605 --> 00:10:06,874
Oh, you make me so nervous.

208
00:10:06,974 --> 00:10:09,476
You know, I called the
school looking for you!

209
00:10:09,576 --> 00:10:10,711
There was a fight, ma.

210
00:10:10,811 --> 00:10:12,612
Oh my god, are you all right?

211
00:10:12,713 --> 00:10:13,613
Come here, let me look at you.

212
00:10:13,714 --> 00:10:14,614
[italian].

213
00:10:14,715 --> 00:10:15,949
Well, he got in a fight.

214
00:10:20,487 --> 00:10:22,389
Let me feel your head.

215
00:10:22,489 --> 00:10:24,324
He's warm.

216
00:10:24,424 --> 00:10:25,392
I'll make you some brioche.

217
00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:27,527
No, pop, not me.

218
00:10:27,627 --> 00:10:28,561
My friend.

219
00:10:28,662 --> 00:10:30,563
Let me see that eye.

220
00:10:30,664 --> 00:10:33,333
Hm, nice shot.

221
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,035
I'll make you some brioche, too.

222
00:10:35,135 --> 00:10:36,603
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Brioche, never heard

223
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:37,971
of the damn thing in my life.

224
00:10:38,071 --> 00:10:40,207
But the Italians,
they swear by it.

225
00:10:40,307 --> 00:10:43,110
From a sore throat to a
toothache to broken bones,

226
00:10:43,210 --> 00:10:45,278
if you were sick, that's
what they gave you.

227
00:10:48,716 --> 00:10:49,817
It's not bad.

228
00:10:53,653 --> 00:10:56,890
It's good.

229
00:10:56,990 --> 00:10:59,492
I can't believe your
parents own a pizzeria.

230
00:10:59,592 --> 00:11:01,862
Can you eat all
the pizza you want?

231
00:11:01,962 --> 00:11:03,130
Yeah.

232
00:11:03,230 --> 00:11:07,000
But the sauce upsets my stomach,
so I've got to watch it.

233
00:11:07,100 --> 00:11:08,969
Do your parents own
a pizza shop, too?

234
00:11:09,069 --> 00:11:10,103
No, my dad's a bricklayer.

235
00:11:10,203 --> 00:11:12,072
Any my mom, she
takes care of us.

236
00:11:12,172 --> 00:11:15,642
- Bricklayer?
- He's a construction worker.

237
00:11:15,743 --> 00:11:17,010
What's your dad do?

238
00:11:17,110 --> 00:11:19,012
My dad died a long time ago.

239
00:11:19,112 --> 00:11:20,948
But my mom has a house
cleaning business.

240
00:11:21,048 --> 00:11:22,482
My dad says
you're from Harlem.

241
00:11:22,582 --> 00:11:24,084
What's it like there?
- Great.

242
00:11:24,184 --> 00:11:24,918
I miss it.

243
00:11:25,018 --> 00:11:26,319
I had a lot of friends there.

244
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,655
And my cousin Carlos,
we'd play stickball, too.

245
00:11:28,756 --> 00:11:30,323
I saw your game the other day.

246
00:11:30,423 --> 00:11:31,624
Are you any good?

247
00:11:31,725 --> 00:11:32,960
I'm OK.

248
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:34,895
We play again on Sunday.
Come down?

249
00:11:34,995 --> 00:11:35,628
Really?

250
00:11:35,729 --> 00:11:36,629
Thanks.

251
00:11:36,730 --> 00:11:37,597
I better get home.

252
00:11:37,697 --> 00:11:38,832
Let's go, I'll walk yous.

253
00:11:38,932 --> 00:11:40,968
Thanks for the pizza, Louie.

254
00:11:41,068 --> 00:11:42,435
Thanks for helping
me at the playground.

255
00:11:42,535 --> 00:11:44,037
Hey, no sweat.

256
00:11:44,137 --> 00:11:45,605
How do you say your name again?

257
00:11:45,705 --> 00:11:47,574
It's Juan Jose.

258
00:11:47,674 --> 00:11:49,142
That's too hard.

259
00:11:49,242 --> 00:11:50,343
How about JJ?

260
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:51,411
Yeah, JJ.

261
00:11:51,511 --> 00:11:52,545
I like it.
- See you, Louie.

262
00:11:52,645 --> 00:11:53,613
All right, see you guys later.

263
00:11:53,713 --> 00:11:54,782
See you later.

264
00:11:59,619 --> 00:12:00,487
Hey, mom.

265
00:12:00,587 --> 00:12:01,755
Mom!

266
00:12:01,855 --> 00:12:03,190
[spanish],, what
happened to your eye?

267
00:12:03,290 --> 00:12:04,157
I had a great day, mom.

268
00:12:04,257 --> 00:12:05,759
I got in a fight
with six Irish kids.

269
00:12:05,859 --> 00:12:07,427
They wanted to take
my lunch money.

270
00:12:07,527 --> 00:12:08,762
They what?

271
00:12:08,862 --> 00:12:11,264
It's OK, because Joey
and Louie had my back.

272
00:12:11,364 --> 00:12:12,399
Joey and Louie?

273
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,534
Joey Esposito from next
door and Louie Mazzarino

274
00:12:14,634 --> 00:12:15,668
from the pizzeria.

275
00:12:15,769 --> 00:12:17,004
What pizzeria?

276
00:12:17,104 --> 00:12:19,139
Louie's parents own a
pizzeria down the block.

277
00:12:19,239 --> 00:12:20,808
Louie's father fixed my eye.
- Uh-huh.

278
00:12:20,908 --> 00:12:22,442
Oh, no.
Let me see that eye, [spanish].

279
00:12:22,542 --> 00:12:24,011
Mom, did you hear me?

280
00:12:24,111 --> 00:12:25,612
His parents own a pizzeria.

281
00:12:25,712 --> 00:12:27,447
All the pizza he can eat.

282
00:12:27,547 --> 00:12:28,381
Who?

283
00:12:28,481 --> 00:12:29,983
Louie!

284
00:12:30,083 --> 00:12:32,752
But he can't eat a lot because
the sauce upsets his stomach.

285
00:12:32,853 --> 00:12:34,721
Mom, I love this place.

286
00:12:34,822 --> 00:12:37,124
OK, [spanish].

287
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,591
Listen, I hope you
didn't eat too much,

288
00:12:38,691 --> 00:12:40,760
OK, because I made dinner.

289
00:12:40,861 --> 00:12:42,229
Go wash up.

290
00:12:42,329 --> 00:12:43,430
Oh, mom.

291
00:12:43,530 --> 00:12:46,599
Next time you go to A&P,
can you get some brioche?

292
00:12:46,699 --> 00:12:48,501
Brioche.

293
00:12:48,601 --> 00:12:50,037
What the hell is brioche?

294
00:12:53,173 --> 00:12:55,075
JJ (VOICEOVER): I couldn't
wait for Sunday to roll around.

295
00:12:55,175 --> 00:12:57,510
They had asked me
to play stickball.

296
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:58,478
Who's this kid?

297
00:12:58,578 --> 00:12:59,847
This is JJ.

298
00:12:59,947 --> 00:13:01,248
Whose team is he on?

299
00:13:01,348 --> 00:13:02,382
He's on my team.

300
00:13:02,482 --> 00:13:03,917
It's me, Louie, and JJ.

301
00:13:04,017 --> 00:13:05,685
Just to make it fair,
we'll take Tomatoes.

302
00:13:05,785 --> 00:13:09,056
You're up first.

303
00:13:09,156 --> 00:13:10,958
JJ (VOICEOVER): So here I
was, Sunday, at the schoolyard

304
00:13:11,058 --> 00:13:12,259
with my new friends.

305
00:13:12,359 --> 00:13:15,095
Nicky caught, Louie
pitched, I played short,

306
00:13:15,195 --> 00:13:16,930
and Joey covered the outfield.

307
00:13:17,030 --> 00:13:19,032
This was my big chance
to prove myself.

308
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:20,633
Bubbles was up
first and hit a line

309
00:13:20,733 --> 00:13:22,402
drive that spun Louie's cap.

310
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:25,072
I dove to my left, and to
everyone's surprise, including

311
00:13:25,172 --> 00:13:28,842
my own, I came up with it.

312
00:13:28,942 --> 00:13:30,510
Bottom of the ninth, two outs.

313
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:31,811
We were down a run.

314
00:13:31,912 --> 00:13:34,747
Joey hit a homer.

315
00:13:34,848 --> 00:13:36,216
Louie tripled.

316
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,651
Now, it wasn't that the
game was so important.

317
00:13:38,751 --> 00:13:39,752
But I had something to prove.

318
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,554
I stepped up to the plate.

319
00:13:41,654 --> 00:13:43,256
My hands were soaking wet.

320
00:13:43,356 --> 00:13:44,557
I was sweating.

321
00:13:44,657 --> 00:13:46,826
I turned my cap around so I
could see the ball better.

322
00:13:46,927 --> 00:13:50,497
I wasn't swinging
till I saw my pitch.

323
00:13:50,597 --> 00:13:53,666
Holy shit, what are you
waiting for, Christmas?

324
00:13:53,766 --> 00:13:54,701
He gets two swings.

325
00:13:54,801 --> 00:13:56,669
Give him something he can hit!

326
00:13:56,769 --> 00:13:59,973
Come on, JJ, wait
for your pitch!

327
00:14:00,073 --> 00:14:01,208
JJ (VOICEOVER):
That pissed me off.

328
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:02,910
The next pitch was
right down the pipe.

329
00:14:03,010 --> 00:14:06,246
I swung as hard as I could.

330
00:14:06,346 --> 00:14:09,549
The ball sailed right
out of the schoolyard.

331
00:14:09,649 --> 00:14:12,419
[cheering]

332
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:15,455
We won.

333
00:14:15,555 --> 00:14:18,158
From that day on, it
was Joey, Louie, and me.

334
00:14:18,258 --> 00:14:21,228
We were the team to beat.

335
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:22,162
Shit!

336
00:14:25,966 --> 00:14:27,000
Oh, yeah!

337
00:14:27,100 --> 00:14:28,035
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Our personalities

338
00:14:28,135 --> 00:14:29,302
were all different.

339
00:14:29,402 --> 00:14:30,537
Joey was a leader.

340
00:14:30,637 --> 00:14:31,571
He was a thinker.

341
00:14:31,671 --> 00:14:33,273
Louie was a hypochondriac.

342
00:14:33,373 --> 00:14:35,175
There was always
something wrong with him.

343
00:14:35,275 --> 00:14:36,809
He always carried a
bottle of that pink stuff

344
00:14:36,910 --> 00:14:38,111
in his back pocket.

345
00:14:38,211 --> 00:14:40,480
And me, I was a wild one.

346
00:14:40,580 --> 00:14:42,415
I could never say no to a dare.

347
00:14:42,515 --> 00:14:43,550
Louie, you OK?

348
00:14:43,650 --> 00:14:44,918
You're not gonna shit
in your pants, are you?

349
00:14:45,018 --> 00:14:46,053
I'm fine.

350
00:14:46,153 --> 00:14:47,320
OK, here's the plan.

351
00:14:47,420 --> 00:14:48,922
Louie, you keep watch
around the corner.

352
00:14:49,022 --> 00:14:51,591
Two whistles if anyone
comes, you got that?

353
00:14:51,691 --> 00:14:52,525
I'll watch the back door.

354
00:14:52,625 --> 00:14:53,826
JJ, you go in.

355
00:14:53,927 --> 00:14:54,761
What should I take?

356
00:14:54,861 --> 00:14:55,662
Get the chickens.

357
00:14:55,762 --> 00:14:56,596
We'll get $2 apiece.

358
00:14:56,696 --> 00:14:57,530
I'll work the rope.

359
00:15:06,073 --> 00:15:09,542
[speaking chinese]

360
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:11,945
Pull the rope!

361
00:15:12,045 --> 00:15:15,548
[speaking chinese]

362
00:15:18,618 --> 00:15:20,520
JJ (VOICEOVER): We bought
a watermelon with the money

363
00:15:20,620 --> 00:15:22,089
we got from the chickens.

364
00:15:22,189 --> 00:15:27,360

we ran into Mrs. Calisuano.

366
00:15:29,762 --> 00:15:32,665
JJ (VOICEOVER): Big, old
Italian woman with a mustache.

367
00:15:32,765 --> 00:15:34,267
And boy, was she mean.

368
00:15:34,367 --> 00:15:35,935
Her husband died in the war.

369
00:15:36,036 --> 00:15:38,005
She's been wearing that
black dress ever since.

370

MRS. CALISUANO:

371
00:15:47,981 --> 00:15:49,449
JJ (VOICEOVER): And
that's when it happened.

372
00:15:53,086 --> 00:15:56,089
I think she's dead.

00:15:56,189 --> 00:15:57,624

[screaming]

375
00:16:02,996 --> 00:16:04,031
All right, baby.

376
00:16:04,131 --> 00:16:05,165
Give me a hard 8.

377
00:16:08,435 --> 00:16:09,269
Shit!

378
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:09,969
A 7!

379
00:16:10,070 --> 00:16:11,404
It's a honey.

380
00:16:11,504 --> 00:16:12,539
Shut up and roll.

381
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:19,412
Honey, honey, give me a 7!

382
00:16:19,512 --> 00:16:20,447
Crap.

383
00:16:20,547 --> 00:16:22,682
That's it, I'm out.

384
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:24,384
Why don't you
bet your Twinkie?

385
00:16:24,484 --> 00:16:25,518
No way.

386
00:16:25,618 --> 00:16:28,588
You got no money
because you always eating.

387
00:16:28,688 --> 00:16:30,823
So?

388
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:32,992
Wow, who's that?

389
00:16:33,093 --> 00:16:34,361
LOUIE: That's Gina Peluso.

390
00:16:34,461 --> 00:16:36,629
She lives in the next building.

391
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:37,964
Joey likes her.

392
00:16:38,065 --> 00:16:38,931
Hey, leave me alone!

393
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:40,767
Ow, get off me!

394
00:16:43,803 --> 00:16:44,871
He's cute.

395
00:16:44,971 --> 00:16:47,774
You always do that
in front of her!

396
00:16:47,874 --> 00:16:48,775
Shut up.

397
00:16:48,875 --> 00:16:51,010
Let's go to the beach.

[MUSIC - LOVIN' SPOONFUL,
 "SUMMER IN THE CITY"]

399
00:16:58,017 --> 00:16:59,886
(SINGING) Hot town,
summer in the city.

400
00:16:59,986 --> 00:17:02,255
Back of my neck gettin'
dirty and gritty.

401
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:04,257
Been down, isn't it a pity?

402
00:17:04,357 --> 00:17:06,526
Doesn't seem to be a
shadow in the city.

403
00:17:06,626 --> 00:17:09,062
All around, people
looking half-dead.

404
00:17:09,162 --> 00:17:12,065
Walking on the sidewalk,
hotter than a match head.

405
00:17:12,165 --> 00:17:14,667
But at night, it's
a different world.

406
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,069
Go out and find a girl.

407
00:17:16,169 --> 00:17:18,438
Come on, come on,
and dance all night.

408
00:17:18,538 --> 00:17:20,440
Despite the heat,
it'll be all right.

409
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:22,442
And babe, don't you
know it's a pity--

410
00:17:22,542 --> 00:17:25,345
JJ (VOICEOVER): This is what
we call the beach, tar beach.

411
00:17:25,445 --> 00:17:28,715
It was our private
resort, most of the time.

[speaking italian]

414
00:17:48,401 --> 00:17:50,303
JJ (VOICEOVER): Sunday
became a big day at Joey's.

415
00:17:50,403 --> 00:17:52,372
Since my mom had to
work, Louie's parents

416
00:17:52,472 --> 00:17:54,907
had to run the pizzeria,
we had macaroni

417
00:17:55,007 --> 00:17:58,411
every Sunday at Joey's, which
made his mom really happy.

418
00:17:58,511 --> 00:18:00,280

us eat our food.

What are you doing here?

421
00:18:05,585 --> 00:18:06,553
I'm eating.

you doing here?

- Hey, Fran.

got a money tree.

Well, I'm glad you
three bananas are here.

429
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:24,137
I want you to stop bothering
that old lady downstairs.

430
00:18:24,237 --> 00:18:25,472
I just ran into
her in the hallway.

431
00:18:25,572 --> 00:18:26,939
She said you three
knuckleheads almost

432
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:28,408
killed her with a watermelon.

433
00:18:28,508 --> 00:18:29,609
And stay off the goddamn roof.

434
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:32,078
That old lady
deserves what she gets.

435
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:33,846
But you should
keep your pants on.

00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:34,747

437
00:18:34,847 --> 00:18:35,748
Why?

438
00:18:35,848 --> 00:18:38,418
What are you laughing about?

439
00:18:38,518 --> 00:18:40,520
I would've loved to see
the look on her face.

00:18:41,588 --> 00:18:42,589

forgetting something?

443
00:18:51,164 --> 00:18:52,532
What?

444
00:18:52,632 --> 00:18:53,666
Oh, oh.

445
00:18:53,766 --> 00:18:54,601
Yeah.

00:18:57,069 --> 00:18:59,272

it to be, Joey?

Tickets to the Yankee game!

450
00:19:03,610 --> 00:19:05,812
Four tickets to
the Yankee game.

451
00:19:05,912 --> 00:19:10,317
And not just four tickets,
four box seats over the Yankee

dugout versus Boston.

453
00:19:12,419 --> 00:19:13,820

who might want to go?

Oh, we do!

455
00:19:14,887 --> 00:19:15,788
Right here, yeah, yeah.

00:19:15,888 --> 00:19:17,123
Come on, yeah.

457
00:19:17,224 --> 00:19:18,191
Think I should let them go?

458
00:19:18,291 --> 00:19:19,359
Yeah, let them go.

All right, you go.

That's it, next Sunday.

461
00:19:22,329 --> 00:19:24,331
But you gotta leave
that old lady alone.

JJ (VOICEOVER): The
Yankee game was great.

463
00:19:26,266 --> 00:19:27,800
It was my first time
ever in box seats.

464
00:19:27,900 --> 00:19:30,703
I was used to sitting up in
the bleachers with the pigeons.

465
00:19:30,803 --> 00:19:34,140
The Yankees swept that weekend,
which put them in first place.

466
00:19:34,241 --> 00:19:37,277
The next day was
Monday, school day.

467
00:19:37,377 --> 00:19:38,678
But we had other plans.

468
00:19:38,778 --> 00:19:39,946
Oh!
Come on, guys!

469
00:19:40,046 --> 00:19:40,847
Look at that!
Look at that!

470
00:19:40,947 --> 00:19:41,781
Oh!
Oh, yeah!

471
00:19:41,881 --> 00:19:42,715
Look at that.

472
00:19:42,815 --> 00:19:43,516
Guys, we got it.

473
00:19:43,616 --> 00:19:44,717
Come on, help me, help me.

00:19:44,817 --> 00:19:45,885
Hey, you kids.

00:19:45,985 --> 00:19:47,720
Do you mind if I
take your picture?

476
00:19:47,820 --> 00:19:48,888
You kids sure are lucky.

477
00:19:48,988 --> 00:19:51,724
I mean, no one ever
catches fish in this lake.

478
00:19:51,824 --> 00:19:52,825
What are your names?

479
00:19:52,925 --> 00:19:55,094
I'm Joey Esposito.

480
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:56,529
Beautiful.

481
00:19:56,629 --> 00:19:59,332
You don't want to go to
school, don't go to school.

482
00:19:59,432 --> 00:20:01,033
He'll end up being like
one of them wise guys

483
00:20:01,133 --> 00:20:02,068
on the street corner, a bum.

484
00:20:02,168 --> 00:20:03,903
How was school yesterday?

485
00:20:04,003 --> 00:20:06,439
It was OK.

486
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,275
How was school yesterday?

487
00:20:08,375 --> 00:20:10,109
It was OK, mom.

488
00:20:10,209 --> 00:20:11,511
Let me tell you
something, Juan.

489
00:20:11,611 --> 00:20:14,614
We did not move up here
for you to play hooky, OK?

What'd you get?

493
00:20:23,189 --> 00:20:24,791
I got a week.

494
00:20:24,891 --> 00:20:29,128
Wow, I got a shot at
the head and three days.

495
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:30,930
Louie, what did you get?

496
00:20:31,030 --> 00:20:31,864
I got nothing.

497
00:20:31,964 --> 00:20:33,733
You got nothing?

Nah.

499
00:20:35,067 --> 00:20:39,038
But you guys are banned from
the pizzeria for a week.

500
00:20:39,138 --> 00:20:40,340
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Could you believe it?

501
00:20:40,440 --> 00:20:42,241
The guy who took our
picture with the fish

502
00:20:42,342 --> 00:20:43,876
was from the Daily News.

503
00:20:43,976 --> 00:20:46,313
Our faces were printed
smack on the front page

504
00:20:46,413 --> 00:20:47,880
of the Bronx Leisure section.

505
00:20:50,683 --> 00:20:55,154
So what do you
guys want to do now?

506
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:56,823
I got no money.

507
00:20:56,923 --> 00:20:57,757
I'm broke.

508
00:20:57,857 --> 00:20:58,658
Me, too.

509
00:21:02,529 --> 00:21:04,230
Hey, let's go
get some chickens.

510
00:21:04,331 --> 00:21:05,798
- Ah, the chicks?
- Yeah.

511
00:21:05,898 --> 00:21:06,966
No way!

512
00:21:07,066 --> 00:21:08,668
We're already in trouble.

513
00:21:08,768 --> 00:21:09,636
So stay here.

514
00:21:14,607 --> 00:21:16,843
Hey!

515
00:21:16,943 --> 00:21:19,579
All right, I'm in!

516
00:21:19,679 --> 00:21:20,980
Same way as last
time, you got that?

517
00:21:28,488 --> 00:21:29,922
JJ: Ow!
Stop!

518
00:21:30,022 --> 00:21:30,890
Get off me!

519
00:21:30,990 --> 00:21:31,891
Ow, my leg!

520
00:21:31,991 --> 00:21:32,892
Let me go!

521
00:21:32,992 --> 00:21:33,793
Let me go!

[speaking chinese]

523
00:21:41,534 --> 00:21:43,436
Bye-bye, bye-bye!

524
00:21:43,536 --> 00:21:45,171
Our luck still hadn't changed.

525
00:21:45,271 --> 00:21:46,606
The chinks were waiting for us.

526
00:21:46,706 --> 00:21:49,709
And boy, did I catch a
beating in that kitchen.

527
00:21:49,809 --> 00:21:52,311
After that, we
turned to the Lord.

528
00:21:52,412 --> 00:21:53,813
The body of Christ.

529
00:21:53,913 --> 00:21:54,747
Amen.

530
00:21:59,051 --> 00:22:00,219
The body of Christ.

531
00:22:00,319 --> 00:22:01,821
Amen.

532
00:22:01,921 --> 00:22:03,823
JJ (VOICEOVER): Louie's parents
made him become an altar boy.

533
00:22:03,923 --> 00:22:05,892
They figured it would
keep him out of trouble.

534
00:22:05,992 --> 00:22:07,460
And that was OK by us.

535
00:22:07,560 --> 00:22:10,129
That just gave us access to
all the wine we could drink.

536
00:22:10,229 --> 00:22:11,197
Come on, Louie, hurry up!

537
00:22:11,297 --> 00:22:12,098
Louie, hurry up!
Let's go!

538
00:22:12,198 --> 00:22:13,232
Come on.

539
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:14,501
Hurry, take it,
take it, take it!

540
00:22:14,601 --> 00:22:15,502
Come on.
- Come on.

541
00:22:15,602 --> 00:22:16,903
Come on.
- It's cold.

542
00:22:17,003 --> 00:22:17,604
Here you go, JJ.
Go on.

543
00:22:17,704 --> 00:22:20,773
Go on,

544
00:22:20,873 --> 00:22:24,210
(sighs) You three
are all good boys.

545
00:22:24,310 --> 00:22:25,545
Come from good families.

546
00:22:25,645 --> 00:22:27,279
I know all your parents.

547
00:22:27,380 --> 00:22:28,781
You have any idea why
you're here today?

548
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:34,787
There was some wine taken
from the church last week.

549
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:38,525
Someone said they saw you
two headed for your roof,

550
00:22:38,625 --> 00:22:39,892
carrying two cases of wine.

551
00:22:42,795 --> 00:22:46,365
Now I'm only going
to ask you this once,

552
00:22:46,466 --> 00:22:47,800
did you take the wine?

553
00:22:47,900 --> 00:22:48,735
Nope.

554
00:22:50,670 --> 00:22:51,504
Nope.

555
00:22:58,244 --> 00:22:59,378
I can't lie to God.

556
00:23:03,583 --> 00:23:04,517
I can't lie to God?

557
00:23:04,617 --> 00:23:05,818
My dad's gonna kill me.

558
00:23:10,222 --> 00:23:11,891
I got a month.

559
00:23:11,991 --> 00:23:12,825
I got two weeks.

560
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,263
What do you want from me?

561
00:23:17,363 --> 00:23:18,164
I told the truth.

562
00:23:20,833 --> 00:23:22,201
JJ (VOICEOVER):
Summer came and went.

563
00:23:22,301 --> 00:23:23,470
The new school year started.

564
00:23:23,570 --> 00:23:25,337
Things calmed down
with out parents.

565
00:23:25,438 --> 00:23:27,039
Big Tony ran the neighborhood.

566
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:29,676
He opened up a social club
around the corner of our house.

567
00:23:29,776 --> 00:23:31,744
We loved to watch
these guys in action.

568
00:23:31,844 --> 00:23:35,214
They had money, fancy clothes,
and the best looking women

569
00:23:35,314 --> 00:23:36,783
in town.

570
00:23:36,883 --> 00:23:39,952
Joey loved this lifestyle, and
he wanted to be a part of it.

571
00:23:40,052 --> 00:23:42,755
Before long, he was
sweeping up, serving

572
00:23:42,855 --> 00:23:44,957
'em coffee in the social club.

573
00:23:50,329 --> 00:23:51,130
It's great money.

574
00:23:51,230 --> 00:23:52,965
Beats stealing chickens.

575
00:23:53,065 --> 00:23:53,900
How much you got saved?

576
00:23:54,000 --> 00:23:55,001
Close to 200.

577
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:56,035
Whoa.

578
00:23:56,135 --> 00:23:57,303
What are ya gonna do with it?

579
00:23:57,403 --> 00:23:58,871
Eh. save it.

580
00:23:58,971 --> 00:24:01,641
One day, the three of us are
gonna open up our own business.

581
00:24:01,741 --> 00:24:03,776
You know, you guys
should start saving too.

582
00:24:03,876 --> 00:24:05,011
JJ (VOICEOVER): That was Joey.

583
00:24:05,111 --> 00:24:06,913
Always planning and
worrying about us.

584
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:10,016
The three of us had a dream to
open up our own bar one day.

585
00:24:10,116 --> 00:24:12,885
A place where all our
family and friends could go.

586
00:24:12,985 --> 00:24:14,754
Louie started working
at the pizzeria,

587
00:24:14,854 --> 00:24:18,525
and I started delivering, would
you believe it, the Daily News.

588
00:24:18,625 --> 00:24:19,526
- Hey, Mrs. M.
- Hey

589
00:24:19,626 --> 00:24:20,459
Hey, Joey.

590
00:24:20,560 --> 00:24:21,728
How's it going?
- Very

591
00:24:21,828 --> 00:24:22,428
Good.

592
00:24:22,529 --> 00:24:23,630
Check it out, man.

593
00:24:29,502 --> 00:24:35,675
[door creaks]

594
00:24:35,775 --> 00:24:36,375
Psst.

595
00:24:36,475 --> 00:24:37,409
Hey, Joey.

596
00:24:37,510 --> 00:24:38,911
JJ, what are you doing here?

597
00:24:39,011 --> 00:24:40,547
Louie's waiting outside
we're going to meet

598
00:24:40,647 --> 00:24:41,981
Gina and her friends for pizza.

599
00:24:42,081 --> 00:24:43,415
You wanna come?

600
00:24:43,516 --> 00:24:45,217
I still need to clean the car.

601
00:24:45,317 --> 00:24:46,653
'Bout an hour, OK?

602
00:24:46,753 --> 00:24:47,620
OK.

603
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:49,656
Hey-- Hey, what
are you doing here?

604
00:24:49,756 --> 00:24:50,623
Huh?

605
00:24:50,723 --> 00:24:51,758
This ain't a
playground here, kid.

606
00:24:51,858 --> 00:24:52,625
Huh?

607
00:24:52,725 --> 00:24:54,093
- Get off me.
- Get off you?

608
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,161
I'll kick you in the ass.

609
00:24:55,261 --> 00:24:58,364
Get the hell out of here.

610
00:24:58,464 --> 00:24:59,899
This ain't a playground.

611
00:24:59,999 --> 00:25:02,769
Now how come you're not hanging
around with you own kind?

612
00:25:02,869 --> 00:25:03,903
Come here.

613
00:25:04,003 --> 00:25:05,938
Make sure and Armor All
the wheels this time.

614
00:25:08,708 --> 00:25:10,042
This a double?

615
00:25:15,147 --> 00:25:17,249
How's it going, Joey?

616
00:25:17,349 --> 00:25:19,151
Sal, can I ask you something?

617
00:25:19,251 --> 00:25:21,888
Sure-- Sure, kid.

618
00:25:21,988 --> 00:25:23,856
There's this girl, Gina,
and she lives next door to me,

619
00:25:23,956 --> 00:25:25,725
and i was thinking of maybe
getting her something.

620
00:25:25,825 --> 00:25:27,226
You like this girl, Gina?

621
00:25:27,326 --> 00:25:28,427
Yeah.

622
00:25:28,527 --> 00:25:29,361
OK.

623
00:25:29,461 --> 00:25:30,329
Here's what you do.

624
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:32,164
Buy her a box of chocolates.

625
00:25:32,264 --> 00:25:33,499
Women love chocolates.

626
00:25:33,600 --> 00:25:34,701
What kind?

627
00:25:34,801 --> 00:25:37,169
You go to Russo's
on Arthur revenue.

628
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:40,006
You tell the lady you
want the ones with the uh,

629
00:25:40,106 --> 00:25:42,441
the cherries inside.

630
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:43,375
Make sure to give wrap it.

631
00:25:43,475 --> 00:25:44,310
Are you sure?

632
00:25:44,410 --> 00:25:45,612
Trust Sally.

633
00:25:45,712 --> 00:25:47,546
Answer Do I know chocolates?
- Thanks, Sally.

634
00:25:47,647 --> 00:25:48,681
Any time, kid.

635
00:25:53,352 --> 00:25:56,823
Are you fucking kidding me?

636
00:25:56,923 --> 00:26:01,360
Alphonse, we've been through
this shit 90 fucking times

637
00:26:01,460 --> 00:26:02,261
already.

638
00:26:02,361 --> 00:26:03,495
It's simple.

639
00:26:03,596 --> 00:26:07,634
You borrow money you
don't pay it back.

640
00:26:07,734 --> 00:26:09,936
Hey, Tony, look--

641
00:26:10,036 --> 00:26:12,371
Not for nothing--
nobody-- y-you--

642
00:26:12,471 --> 00:26:14,106
you're robbing me here.

643
00:26:14,206 --> 00:26:16,242
I mean-- I mean you
charged me five points.

644
00:26:16,342 --> 00:26:18,878
I could've done it for three
points from Johnny White Shoes.

645
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:21,380
Hey-- hey, I don't give a
shit about Johnny White Shoes.

646
00:26:21,480 --> 00:26:22,915
You owe me money.

647
00:26:23,015 --> 00:26:24,250
I don't think--

648
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:27,053
I don't think I should have
to pay you two extra points.

649
00:26:27,153 --> 00:26:27,954
Listen to this you--

650
00:26:28,054 --> 00:26:30,222
you stuttering piece of shit.

651
00:26:30,322 --> 00:26:31,658
A deal is a deal.

652
00:26:34,393 --> 00:26:35,728
Then fuck-- fuck you.

653
00:26:35,828 --> 00:26:37,096
You gotta wait for your money.

654
00:26:37,196 --> 00:26:38,264
Fuck me?

655
00:26:38,364 --> 00:26:39,999
[thud]

656
00:26:49,642 --> 00:26:51,711
- What should we do?
- We do nothing.

657
00:26:51,811 --> 00:26:53,145
We say nothing.

658
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,282
We never tell anybody
about this, OK?

659
00:26:56,382 --> 00:26:57,884
OK?

660
00:26:57,984 --> 00:26:58,617
OK.

661
00:26:58,718 --> 00:27:01,688
OK, put your heads in.

662
00:27:01,788 --> 00:27:03,255
On three, I swear.

663
00:27:03,355 --> 00:27:04,356
One.
Two.

664
00:27:04,456 --> 00:27:05,291
Three.

665
00:27:05,391 --> 00:27:06,225
(TOGETHER) I swear.

666
00:27:10,730 --> 00:27:12,231
JJ (VOICEOVER): 15
years later, Joey

667
00:27:12,331 --> 00:27:15,601
was working for Pauly, who ran
the social club for Big Tony.

668
00:27:15,702 --> 00:27:17,136
Louie was making pizzas.

669
00:27:17,236 --> 00:27:18,237
And me?

670
00:27:18,337 --> 00:27:20,039
I was digging graves
at Woodlawn Cemetery. .

671
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,374
We still had our dream
of owning the bar,

672
00:27:22,474 --> 00:27:24,576
but that dream
was slipping away.

673
00:27:24,677 --> 00:27:27,546
None of us were able
to save any money.

674
00:27:27,646 --> 00:27:31,150
Our stick ball game went from
the schoolyard to the streets.

675
00:27:31,250 --> 00:27:33,986
Joey, Louie, and me, we
were still the team to beat.

676
00:27:51,938 --> 00:27:54,073
Hey-- hey, Mr. M. How
about a couple beers?

677
00:27:54,173 --> 00:27:57,343
- What kind?
- Coldest you got.

678
00:27:57,443 --> 00:27:59,511
Hey, Pop.

679
00:27:59,611 --> 00:28:00,446
Thank you.

680
00:28:00,546 --> 00:28:01,848
Here you go gentlemen.

681
00:28:01,948 --> 00:28:02,949
You share of the
stick ball game.

682
00:28:03,049 --> 00:28:04,250
Don't spend it all in one place.

683
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,184
Thank you.

684
00:28:05,284 --> 00:28:06,152
Thank, Joey.

685
00:28:06,252 --> 00:28:08,620
Let me give you
three guys a tip.

686
00:28:08,721 --> 00:28:11,157
Whatever you do today,
don't go up the block.

687
00:28:11,257 --> 00:28:12,792
What're you
talking about, Pop?

688
00:28:12,892 --> 00:28:13,760
Just do what I say.

689
00:28:13,860 --> 00:28:14,961
Don't go there.

690
00:28:15,061 --> 00:28:16,195
Why not?

691
00:28:16,295 --> 00:28:19,665
Because they're giving
jobs away today, that's why.

692
00:28:19,766 --> 00:28:21,233
We already got jobs.

693
00:28:21,333 --> 00:28:23,369
Then explain to me why
you're playing stick ball

694
00:28:23,469 --> 00:28:26,105
on the street for money, eh?

695
00:28:26,205 --> 00:28:31,043
Hey, Pops, give me, uh,
a slice and a iced tea.

696
00:28:31,143 --> 00:28:34,781
Two-fifty, and
I'm not your Pop.

697
00:28:34,881 --> 00:28:36,382
Thanks, Pops.
[laughs]

698
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:37,483
Skinny Sammy.

699
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:38,918
What's going on?

700
00:28:39,018 --> 00:28:41,320
Hey, JJ, man I didn't
even see you standing there.

701
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:42,254
How you doin'?

702
00:28:42,354 --> 00:28:43,589
All right, man.

703
00:28:43,689 --> 00:28:45,157
You guys still playing football
in that league on Sundays?

704
00:28:45,257 --> 00:28:46,225
Shit, man.

705
00:28:46,325 --> 00:28:47,193
We running that league.

706
00:28:47,293 --> 00:28:48,727
Man, that competition
must be weak.

707
00:28:48,828 --> 00:28:50,329
Whoa, whoa.
Weak?

708
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,563
Shit, man.

709
00:28:51,663 --> 00:28:52,531
I don't see your ass
out there anymore.

710
00:28:52,631 --> 00:28:54,333
How bout a little 6 on 6?

711
00:28:54,433 --> 00:28:55,902
Hey, man, check this out.

712
00:28:56,002 --> 00:28:58,437
I ain't wasting my time unless
y'all putting up some green.

713
00:28:58,537 --> 00:28:59,471
How about a hundred?

714
00:28:59,571 --> 00:29:00,706
No way.

715
00:29:00,807 --> 00:29:02,208
how about 200?

716
00:29:02,308 --> 00:29:03,709
For a game?

717
00:29:03,810 --> 00:29:05,244
200 a man.

718
00:29:05,344 --> 00:29:06,345
Now you're talking.

719
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,513
Two weeks from Sunday
at the high school.

720
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:08,647
You guys better show up.

721
00:29:08,747 --> 00:29:09,816
You got-- you guys got a ref?

722
00:29:09,916 --> 00:29:11,183
Yeah we got a ref.

723
00:29:11,283 --> 00:29:12,819
All right, the motherfucker
better be honest.

724
00:29:12,919 --> 00:29:14,120
Hey, don't sweat
it Skinny Sammy.

725
00:29:14,220 --> 00:29:16,755
Winning team's got
to give the ref $100.

726
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,792
You guys better bring
the motherfucking Giants.

727
00:29:19,892 --> 00:29:21,660
You always get us
into this shit, JJ.

728
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:23,162
Hey, I only sad 100.

729
00:29:23,262 --> 00:29:24,897
He said 2.

730
00:29:24,997 --> 00:29:26,065
Don't worry about it.

731
00:29:29,668 --> 00:29:31,103
[sighs]

732
00:29:31,203 --> 00:29:33,739
So what's the
story with this bar?

733
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:34,874
I didn't see it yet.

734
00:29:34,974 --> 00:29:36,408
Guys said it needs
a little work.

735
00:29:36,508 --> 00:29:38,677
His brother had it 22 years,
probably never fixed it up.

736
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,147
It's been closed 6
months, since he died.

737
00:29:41,247 --> 00:29:41,848
So how much?

738
00:29:41,948 --> 00:29:43,049
It's not that much.

739
00:29:43,149 --> 00:29:44,483
it's even got a
small kitchen, Louie.

740
00:29:44,583 --> 00:29:46,285
Guy said we could have
everything inside, including

741
00:29:46,385 --> 00:29:48,587
the inventory, and we could use
his liquor license until we get

742
00:29:48,687 --> 00:29:49,822
it transferred into our name.

743
00:29:49,922 --> 00:29:52,158
Plus, a ten year
lease for 30 grand.

744
00:29:52,258 --> 00:29:53,926
Then I figured we'd
get another 15 or 20

745
00:29:54,026 --> 00:29:55,627
to fix it up, so probably 50.

746
00:29:55,727 --> 00:29:57,463
That's great.
What do I gotta make?

747
00:29:57,563 --> 00:29:58,898
5,000 pizzas for my share?

748
00:29:58,998 --> 00:30:01,300
And he's gotta
dig 12,000 graves?

749
00:30:01,400 --> 00:30:02,401
I don't understand.

750
00:30:02,501 --> 00:30:03,802
You know what your problem is?

751
00:30:03,903 --> 00:30:04,937
You worry so much
it makes you sick.

752
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:06,605
No, I'm serious.
Look at you.

753
00:30:06,705 --> 00:30:08,274
Eye drops, ear
drops, nose drops.

754
00:30:08,374 --> 00:30:09,808
If it ain't his
stomach it's his head.

755
00:30:09,909 --> 00:30:11,477
If it ain't his
head it's his ass.

756
00:30:11,577 --> 00:30:13,045
Louie, relax.

757
00:30:13,145 --> 00:30:14,380
I don't understand this guy.

758
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:17,349
What does me being sick
got to do with the bar?

759
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:18,617
So, are you in?

760
00:30:18,717 --> 00:30:20,452
Yeah, I'm in.

761
00:30:20,552 --> 00:30:21,487
Let's do it.

762
00:30:21,587 --> 00:30:22,821
Let's do it.

763
00:30:22,922 --> 00:30:26,258
My brother Philly had
this brace for 22 years.

764
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:29,228
22 years.

765
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:32,164
Now, believe me, he
made a lot of money.

766
00:30:32,264 --> 00:30:34,901
A lot of money.

767
00:30:35,001 --> 00:30:37,169
That was before your time.

768
00:30:37,269 --> 00:30:40,539
And the women, listen,
my brother Philly

769
00:30:40,639 --> 00:30:45,044
wasn't a handsome man, but
when you own a bar, the women,

770
00:30:45,144 --> 00:30:48,480
(WHOOP) they love you.

771
00:30:48,580 --> 00:30:50,983
Sorry to hear about your
brother, Mr. Slotnick.

772
00:30:51,083 --> 00:30:52,484
It was for the best.

773
00:30:52,584 --> 00:30:54,753
His kidneys were shot.

774
00:30:54,853 --> 00:30:56,956
Don't ever grow old.

775
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:58,690
Place needs a lot of work,

776
00:30:58,790 --> 00:31:00,192
What work?

777
00:31:00,292 --> 00:31:04,496
A little paint, a couple of
nails and it's brand new.

778
00:31:04,596 --> 00:31:06,665
We were hoping you would
hold a note for the 30 grand

779
00:31:06,765 --> 00:31:08,034
for five years.

780
00:31:08,134 --> 00:31:09,501
I mean, it probably
won't even take that long.

781
00:31:09,601 --> 00:31:10,836
Just help us get it going.

782
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,438
Mr. Slotnick, I know if
you could hold the note,

783
00:31:12,538 --> 00:31:14,440
we can come up the money to fix
this place up, and get it open.

784
00:31:14,540 --> 00:31:16,108
I can't do it.

785
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:19,011
I'm moving to Miami,
I need the cash.

786
00:31:19,111 --> 00:31:20,779
You boys have my number.

787
00:31:20,879 --> 00:31:22,949
Think it over and
get back to me.

788
00:31:23,049 --> 00:31:27,186
I was your age, I would
jump all over this deal.

789
00:31:31,623 --> 00:31:37,964
Me

790
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:42,268
[speaking italian]

791
00:31:42,368 --> 00:31:43,102
Excuse me, Don.

792
00:31:43,202 --> 00:31:44,636
Tony-- Tony, Connie called.

793
00:31:44,736 --> 00:31:46,172
She's drunk.

794
00:31:46,272 --> 00:31:47,940
Now I told her you weren't
here, but she's on her way over.

795
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:48,941
I know it.

796
00:31:49,041 --> 00:31:50,542
You see this, Don Pasquale?

797
00:31:50,642 --> 00:31:51,477
Huh?

798
00:31:51,577 --> 00:31:52,778
I'm leaving.

799
00:31:52,878 --> 00:31:53,980
You tell her you ain't
seen me for a week.

800
00:31:54,080 --> 00:31:56,082
This is fucking
broad's a nut job.

801
00:31:56,182 --> 00:31:57,916
I'd love to make her disappear.

802
00:31:58,017 --> 00:31:59,918
Come on, Don Pasquale,
I'll take you home.

803
00:32:00,019 --> 00:32:00,819
Hey, Tony.

804
00:32:00,919 --> 00:32:03,422
All right

805
00:32:03,522 --> 00:32:04,856
- Hey, Tony.
- Hey.

806
00:32:04,957 --> 00:32:05,757
Hey.

807
00:32:05,857 --> 00:32:06,692
What's up, Pauly?

808
00:32:06,792 --> 00:32:07,926
Nothing.

809
00:32:08,027 --> 00:32:10,662
It's just another
aggravating day.

810
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:11,930
So, what do you got for me?

811
00:32:12,031 --> 00:32:12,931
All right.

812
00:32:13,032 --> 00:32:14,500
Here's the action for today.

813
00:32:14,600 --> 00:32:17,903
The jeweler wants the Yanks 100
times, you want to cover it?

814
00:32:18,004 --> 00:32:19,238
Yeah, hell with him.

815
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:21,607
He don't pay, I
get a free watch.

816
00:32:21,707 --> 00:32:23,142
All right.

817
00:32:23,242 --> 00:32:25,411
Here's money from Aldo, the
bus driving the chicken man.

818
00:32:25,511 --> 00:32:28,447
You know that, uh, skinny
guy at the used car lot,

819
00:32:28,547 --> 00:32:29,715
down on Jerome avenue?

820
00:32:29,815 --> 00:32:30,916
What-- what's his name?

821
00:32:31,017 --> 00:32:31,850
Barry.

822
00:32:31,950 --> 00:32:32,818
Yeah, Barry.

823
00:32:32,918 --> 00:32:34,253
Look, he's late.

824
00:32:34,353 --> 00:32:36,222
So you save me, and I'll
see you talk to him for me.

825
00:32:36,322 --> 00:32:37,523
OK?

826
00:32:37,623 --> 00:32:38,857
Tomorrow.
Salute.

827
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:39,992
Salute.

828
00:32:42,628 --> 00:32:44,163
Mm, Pauley.

829
00:32:44,263 --> 00:32:45,998
Remember that bar I
was telling you about?

830
00:32:46,098 --> 00:32:47,233
I'm putting together
some investors

831
00:32:47,333 --> 00:32:48,834
and you're the first
one we thought of.

832
00:32:48,934 --> 00:32:51,403
(LAUGHING) You
go slow, huh Joey?

833
00:32:51,503 --> 00:32:52,538
Look.

834
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:54,540
I'd love to help you,
but I'm a married man.

835
00:32:54,640 --> 00:32:56,875
I got a kid in college, I got
another one going next year.

836
00:32:56,975 --> 00:33:00,679
Plus, I got a mortgage
on the house, right?

837
00:33:00,779 --> 00:33:04,116
Plus, I'm into
Tony for 20 grand.

838
00:33:04,216 --> 00:33:05,684
I can't do it, kid.

839
00:33:05,784 --> 00:33:08,154
Well, what about Tony?

840
00:33:08,254 --> 00:33:09,821
Forget about it.

841
00:33:09,921 --> 00:33:11,090
He'll ask five points.

842
00:33:11,190 --> 00:33:13,725
You'll end up with
Tony as your partner.

843
00:33:13,825 --> 00:33:17,029
All right, Pauley.
Thanks anyway.

844
00:33:17,129 --> 00:33:18,197
Get outta here.

845
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:26,572
- Any luck?
- Forget it.

846
00:33:26,672 --> 00:33:27,973
He's in the hole himself.

847
00:33:28,074 --> 00:33:30,909
Louie, how about your parents?
- It's been slow.

848
00:33:31,009 --> 00:33:32,978
Plus, my pops, he
hates the bar business.

849
00:33:33,079 --> 00:33:34,913
He's never going to do it.

850
00:33:35,013 --> 00:33:36,315
What about your cousin, Carlos?

851
00:33:36,415 --> 00:33:37,616
He must have a lot of
dirty money laying around.

852
00:33:37,716 --> 00:33:39,318
He's got a lot of dirty
money laying around.

853
00:33:39,418 --> 00:33:40,886
Problem is, he's opening
up an after hours

854
00:33:40,986 --> 00:33:41,887
joint right here in the Bronx.

855
00:33:41,987 --> 00:33:43,455
It's all tied up.

856
00:33:43,555 --> 00:33:44,156
Fuck.

857
00:33:44,256 --> 00:33:45,391
Pauley, where is he?

858
00:33:45,491 --> 00:33:46,792
Connie, what are
you doing here?

859
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:48,727
- Where is that son of a bitch?
- Shh.

860
00:33:48,827 --> 00:33:49,795
Will you keep it down?

861
00:33:49,895 --> 00:33:52,030
Don't shush me.

862
00:33:52,131 --> 00:33:53,532
Where the fuck is he?

863
00:33:53,632 --> 00:33:55,634
Look, I swear on my eyes,
I ain't seen him in a week.

864
00:33:55,734 --> 00:33:56,635
Now what do you want from me?

865
00:33:56,735 --> 00:33:58,604
Oh, you are lying.

866
00:33:58,704 --> 00:34:00,339
You want to know what
that bastard did to me?

867
00:34:00,439 --> 00:34:02,941
He cut off my credit cards,
and he hasn't made a payment

868
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,510
on my car in over three months.

869
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:05,311
Look

870
00:34:05,411 --> 00:34:06,578
They're gonna take it away.

871
00:34:06,678 --> 00:34:07,579
Let me drive you home.

872
00:34:07,679 --> 00:34:09,248
- Get your fucking hands off me.
- OK.

873
00:34:09,348 --> 00:34:10,082
OK.

874
00:34:10,182 --> 00:34:11,583
What does he want, me to work?

875
00:34:11,683 --> 00:34:13,685
Connie, not for nothing,
but things have been slow.

876
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:15,187
It's not like it used to be.

877
00:34:15,287 --> 00:34:17,756
Don't bullshit me.

878
00:34:17,856 --> 00:34:19,925
That cheap bastard is loaded.

879
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,560
He told me things, Pauley.

880
00:34:21,660 --> 00:34:24,430
Don't think that I don't
know what he's up to.

881
00:34:24,530 --> 00:34:26,298
I know he's got money
hidden in that fake wall

882
00:34:26,398 --> 00:34:29,401
in the bedroom closet.
- Will you--

883
00:34:29,501 --> 00:34:30,869
Look Connie, let
me drive you home.

884
00:34:30,969 --> 00:34:33,472
If Tony finds out you're
here he's going to be pissed.

885
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:40,612
He doesn't want to talk to me,
fine, but I bet the IRS would.

886
00:34:40,712 --> 00:34:41,713
I bet they would.

887
00:34:44,250 --> 00:34:46,285
Looks like Tony's got
his hands full, huh?

888
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,154
Fuck him, he deserves
whatever he gets.

889
00:34:48,254 --> 00:34:50,656
Must have 100 grand
in that wall, easy.

890
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,990
Probably.

891
00:34:52,090 --> 00:34:53,725
You know what I'm
thinking, right?

892
00:34:53,825 --> 00:34:54,893
What are you?
[non-english]?

893
00:34:54,993 --> 00:34:56,027
Forget about it.

894
00:34:56,128 --> 00:34:57,028
Why?

895
00:34:57,129 --> 00:34:57,896
It's our ticket to the bar.

896
00:34:57,996 --> 00:34:59,198
What do you think?

897
00:34:59,298 --> 00:35:00,466
This is a poor man's
village [non-english]??

898
00:35:00,566 --> 00:35:01,933
He ain't going to
take off your tongue.

899
00:35:02,033 --> 00:35:02,734
This guy will cut your
fucking heart out.

900
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:03,835
Forget about it.

901
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,837
JJ, he's a made guy.

902
00:35:05,937 --> 00:35:06,772
You know, I know who he is.

903
00:35:06,872 --> 00:35:07,806
Fuck him.

904
00:35:07,906 --> 00:35:09,208
He's always been an asshole.

905
00:35:09,308 --> 00:35:10,976
He doesn't give a shit
about anybody but himself.

906
00:35:11,076 --> 00:35:12,544
I say, let's do it.

907
00:35:12,644 --> 00:35:14,180
He's taken everybody's money
in this neighborhood for years.

908
00:35:14,280 --> 00:35:16,948
I say, let's pay the
son of a bitch back.

909
00:35:17,048 --> 00:35:18,250
[laughs]

910
00:35:18,350 --> 00:35:19,951
The hell's so funny?

911
00:35:20,051 --> 00:35:20,852
You're nuts.

912
00:35:20,952 --> 00:35:21,787
You know that?

913
00:35:21,887 --> 00:35:23,322
You're fucking nuts.

914
00:35:23,422 --> 00:35:24,756
Yeah maybe I'm nuts.

915
00:35:24,856 --> 00:35:25,724
I don't know.

916
00:35:31,563 --> 00:35:32,298
Gina.

917
00:35:32,398 --> 00:35:33,332
Hey, you're not even dressed.

918
00:35:33,432 --> 00:35:36,034
Come on, we're gonna be late.

919
00:35:36,134 --> 00:35:38,937
Joey, when are we
going to get married?

920
00:35:39,037 --> 00:35:40,071
We ain't got time
to get married,

921
00:35:40,172 --> 00:35:41,707
baby, we get reservations.
Come on.

922
00:35:41,807 --> 00:35:44,376
Joe, I'm serious.

923
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,712
We've been dating,
what, 15 years?

924
00:35:46,812 --> 00:35:47,646
16

925
00:35:47,746 --> 00:35:49,147
OK, 16.

926
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:50,816
I just want to get
to know you better.

927
00:35:50,916 --> 00:35:52,884
Joseph, I'm serious.

928
00:35:56,355 --> 00:35:58,457
Gina, you know we're
trying to save for the bar.

929
00:35:58,557 --> 00:35:59,791
I ain't got that kind of money.

930
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,360
You got any idea what
it costs to get married?

931
00:36:01,460 --> 00:36:04,730
You gotta get limos,
flowers, food, wedding hall.

932
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,266
What, between me and you
we know 150 people each?

933
00:36:07,366 --> 00:36:08,700
I get married, I go
15 grand in the hole.

934
00:36:08,800 --> 00:36:10,402
Easy.
I ain't got that kind of money.

935
00:36:10,502 --> 00:36:11,603
My parents ain't got it.

936
00:36:11,703 --> 00:36:13,472
Your parents ain't
giving it to us.

937
00:36:13,572 --> 00:36:14,306
Come on.

938
00:36:14,406 --> 00:36:16,275
We can't afford to get married.

939
00:36:16,375 --> 00:36:17,409
Let's go, get dressed.

940
00:36:22,681 --> 00:36:23,515
I'm pregnant.

941
00:36:26,252 --> 00:36:29,221
What're you thinking Joey?

942
00:36:29,321 --> 00:36:30,889
We're gonna have a baby.

943
00:36:33,559 --> 00:36:36,695
So, how did this happen?

944
00:36:36,795 --> 00:36:38,730
Come on guys, I know how
it happened, but when?

945
00:36:38,830 --> 00:36:39,665
How long?

946
00:36:39,765 --> 00:36:40,932
Almost four months.

947
00:36:41,032 --> 00:36:41,933
Are you going to get married?

948
00:36:42,033 --> 00:36:43,068
Mhm

949
00:36:43,168 --> 00:36:44,236
You guys can't
afford a wedding.

950
00:36:44,336 --> 00:36:45,537
Yeah, I worked
it out with Vito.

951
00:36:45,637 --> 00:36:47,138
I'm getting his place,
a buffet, [inaudible]

952
00:36:47,239 --> 00:36:48,640
I'm asking Roberta to sing.

953
00:36:48,740 --> 00:36:49,575
That's it.

954
00:36:49,675 --> 00:36:50,309
When?

955
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:51,710
Next Saturday.

956
00:36:51,810 --> 00:36:53,078
Saturday?

957
00:36:53,178 --> 00:36:54,480
I guess you got to send the
invitations through the phone.

958
00:36:54,580 --> 00:36:56,181
Friends and family.
Real small.

959
00:36:56,282 --> 00:36:57,316
How about a toast?

960
00:37:00,786 --> 00:37:02,120
To Joey and Gina.

961
00:37:02,220 --> 00:37:05,291
I've known both of you
almost all my life.

962
00:37:05,391 --> 00:37:08,694
To two people who
share so much love.

963
00:37:08,794 --> 00:37:12,731
Not only with each other,
but with JJ and myself.

964
00:37:12,831 --> 00:37:14,866
And now you're
adding to the family.

965
00:37:14,966 --> 00:37:18,970
And I just want to say that
we both love you very much.

966
00:37:19,070 --> 00:37:20,872
And congratulations.

967
00:37:20,972 --> 00:37:21,807
Thank you, Louie.

968
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:22,741
(ALL) Salute.

969
00:37:25,210 --> 00:37:26,712
Thank you.

970
00:37:26,812 --> 00:37:27,646
Let's eat.

971
00:37:37,356 --> 00:37:39,224
And what did you say?

972
00:37:39,325 --> 00:37:40,526
I said no.

973
00:37:40,626 --> 00:37:42,594
Father Riley looks
Louie square in the eye,

974
00:37:42,694 --> 00:37:46,031
and before you even ask him if
he did anything, Louie goes,

975
00:37:46,131 --> 00:37:47,265
I said I can't lie to God.

976
00:37:47,366 --> 00:37:49,535
[all laughing]

977
00:37:49,635 --> 00:37:51,202
JJ and I get
punished for a month.

978
00:37:51,303 --> 00:37:52,571
Louis gets off for
ratting us out.

979
00:37:52,671 --> 00:37:54,373
And then Old Lady
Calisuano got her revenge

980
00:37:54,473 --> 00:37:56,107
on us for knocking her out.

981
00:37:56,207 --> 00:37:57,909
She was the one that
told Father Riley.

982
00:37:58,009 --> 00:38:00,145
She must be 90 by now?

983
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:01,146
Don't worry about her.

984
00:38:01,246 --> 00:38:02,714
She gonna outlive all of us.

985
00:38:02,814 --> 00:38:05,617
Must have been great
growing up together like that.

986
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,386
Oh, it was fun.

987
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:09,054
These guys are inseparable.

988
00:38:09,154 --> 00:38:11,457
When Joey and I would make
a date, the three of them

989
00:38:11,557 --> 00:38:12,924
would pick me up.

990
00:38:13,024 --> 00:38:16,094
Hey guys, I hate to break
this up, but I got to go.

991
00:38:16,194 --> 00:38:17,228
Where are you going?

992
00:38:17,329 --> 00:38:18,497
I gotta go see
my cousin, Carlos.

993
00:38:18,597 --> 00:38:19,598
You going to Harlem now?

994
00:38:19,698 --> 00:38:20,532
It's 11:30.

995
00:38:20,632 --> 00:38:22,133
Gotta pick up some money.

996
00:38:22,233 --> 00:38:23,469
Can't wait for day time?

997
00:38:23,569 --> 00:38:24,703
It's my old neighborhood.

998
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:25,637
Come on, JJ.

999
00:38:25,737 --> 00:38:27,038
You haven't been
there in 15 years.

1000
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:27,939
You taking Lisette?

1001
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:28,974
Nah.

1002
00:38:29,074 --> 00:38:30,075
I'm gonna drop her off first.

1003
00:38:30,175 --> 00:38:31,009
Be careful.

1004
00:38:31,109 --> 00:38:32,711
Always big brother.

1005
00:38:32,811 --> 00:38:33,879
Bye.

1006
00:38:33,979 --> 00:38:34,813
Hey.

1007
00:38:34,913 --> 00:38:36,181
Congratulations.

1008
00:38:36,281 --> 00:38:37,115
Night, Gigi.

1009
00:38:37,215 --> 00:38:39,951
Bye.

1010
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,887
I don't like that Carlos.

1011
00:38:41,987 --> 00:38:42,921
I don't trust him.

1012
00:38:48,794 --> 00:38:50,061
Hey, man.

1013
00:38:50,161 --> 00:38:51,096
Hey.

1014
00:38:51,196 --> 00:38:52,364
It's a private party, all right.

1015
00:38:52,464 --> 00:38:53,264
You on the list?

1016
00:38:53,365 --> 00:38:54,866
List?

1017
00:38:54,966 --> 00:38:57,403
Just go tell Carlos, cousin JJ's
here from the Bronx, all right?

1018
00:39:03,375 --> 00:39:04,309
Yeah.

1019
00:39:04,410 --> 00:39:05,577
I need Carlos to the back door.

1020
00:39:08,279 --> 00:39:10,048
So what's going on, man?
You busy?

1021
00:39:17,623 --> 00:39:19,991
[laughs] Hey, primo.

1022
00:39:20,091 --> 00:39:21,326
How's Aunt Maria?

1023
00:39:21,427 --> 00:39:22,728
She's doing good, man.

1024
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:23,495
How's business?

1025
00:39:23,595 --> 00:39:25,196
We making money, primo.

1026
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:27,332
We making money.

1027
00:39:27,433 --> 00:39:29,334
I can see that.

1028
00:39:29,435 --> 00:39:31,937
Hey, Manny, this is my primo.

1029
00:39:32,037 --> 00:39:35,306
Whenever he comes here you
treat him like a King, OK?

1030
00:39:35,407 --> 00:39:37,208
Sure, Carlos.

1031
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:38,744
Nice to meet you.

1032
00:39:41,513 --> 00:39:42,914
Are you ready?

1033
00:39:43,014 --> 00:39:43,849
Vamos.

1034
00:39:50,722 --> 00:39:52,658
Manny keep your
eye on everything.

1035
00:39:52,758 --> 00:39:53,925
Be back in a little while.

1036
00:39:54,025 --> 00:39:55,494
That ain't no problem.

1037
00:40:01,299 --> 00:40:12,343
[italian singing]

1038
00:40:12,444 --> 00:40:13,479
- You look beautiful.
- Hey Jay.

1039
00:40:13,579 --> 00:40:14,713
- Hey, brother.
- How are you?

1040
00:40:14,813 --> 00:40:15,914
You look handsome.
- Thank you.

1041
00:40:16,014 --> 00:40:16,848
You are handsome.

1042
00:40:16,948 --> 00:40:17,783
Hey.

1043
00:40:17,883 --> 00:40:18,884
Look at you.

1044
00:40:18,984 --> 00:40:19,818
Where's Louie?

1045
00:40:19,918 --> 00:40:21,152
He went to go
pick up his date.

1046
00:40:21,252 --> 00:40:22,287
Louie's got a date?

1047
00:40:22,387 --> 00:40:23,221
Mhm.

1048
00:40:23,321 --> 00:40:25,223
Hey, here he comes now.

1049
00:40:25,323 --> 00:40:26,157
Hey guys.

1050
00:40:26,257 --> 00:40:27,292
Beautiful.

1051
00:40:27,392 --> 00:40:28,594
So I miss anything?

1052
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:31,129
Just Roberta singing
"Santa Lucia" again.

1053
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,831
Ah, you look great.

1054
00:40:32,931 --> 00:40:34,132
Thank you.

1055
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,568
So, who this?

1056
00:40:36,668 --> 00:40:37,569
I'm sorry, everyone.

1057
00:40:37,669 --> 00:40:39,137
This is Laura.
Everybody.

1058
00:40:39,237 --> 00:40:40,038
Hi.

1059
00:40:40,138 --> 00:40:41,172
I'm Lisette.

1060
00:40:41,272 --> 00:40:43,008
- JJ.
- Joey.

1061
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:44,309
This is my wife, Gina.

1062
00:40:44,409 --> 00:40:45,744
Louie's told me so
much about all of you.

1063
00:40:45,844 --> 00:40:47,412
I feel I already know you.

1064
00:40:47,513 --> 00:40:49,014
- Where are you from?
- Westchester.

1065
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,348
White Plains.
- Whoa.

1066
00:40:50,448 --> 00:40:51,483
Good going, Louie.

1067
00:40:51,583 --> 00:40:52,684
What do you do?

1068
00:40:52,784 --> 00:40:54,052
I'm in my second
year of residency

1069
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,053
at Westchester Medical Center.

1070
00:40:56,588 --> 00:40:57,989
What?
What's funny?

1071
00:40:58,089 --> 00:40:58,924
What's so funny?

1072
00:40:59,024 --> 00:41:00,926
It's perfect.

1073
00:41:01,026 --> 00:41:01,993
This kid's always sick.

1074
00:41:02,093 --> 00:41:02,994
Match made in heaven.

1075
00:41:03,094 --> 00:41:04,129
Come on, Joey.

1076
00:41:04,229 --> 00:41:05,196
Ah, the Tarentella.

1077
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:06,097
Let's go.

1078
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,098
Mikey, come on.

1079
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,297
The hell are
you doing in here?

1080
00:42:12,397 --> 00:42:13,965
Just doing a little tootskie.

1081
00:42:14,065 --> 00:42:15,366
What're you doing
that shit for?

1082
00:42:15,466 --> 00:42:17,202
Celebrate, bro.
You want a hit?

1083
00:42:17,302 --> 00:42:19,204
Man, get that away from me.

1084
00:42:19,304 --> 00:42:20,606
What's the matter?

1085
00:42:20,706 --> 00:42:22,641
I don't appreciate you
doing that at my wedding.

1086
00:42:22,741 --> 00:42:24,209
How long you been
doing this for?

1087
00:42:24,309 --> 00:42:26,578
Do it once in a blue moon.

1088
00:42:26,678 --> 00:42:28,479
I bet you get it
from Carlos, right?

1089
00:42:28,580 --> 00:42:29,948
Yeah.

1090
00:42:30,048 --> 00:42:31,516
Hey, Joey, what's the big deal?
I do it once in a while.

1091
00:42:31,617 --> 00:42:33,351
Stop breaking my balls.
- Hey.

1092
00:42:33,451 --> 00:42:34,920
Got little kids
running around in here.

1093
00:42:35,020 --> 00:42:37,322
I don;t Like the idea of you
bringing that around my family.

1094
00:42:37,422 --> 00:42:39,625
Besides, you put me in a
stupid football game tomorrow.

1095
00:42:39,725 --> 00:42:40,926
Let me tell you something, pal.

1096
00:42:41,026 --> 00:42:42,861
You better be up and
ready in the morning.

1097
00:42:42,961 --> 00:42:44,195
It's your wedding night.

1098
00:42:44,295 --> 00:42:46,031
You're worried about a
stupid football game?

1099
00:42:46,131 --> 00:42:48,299
Let's have some fun.

1100
00:42:48,399 --> 00:42:50,435
Besides, we got a song to sing.

1101
00:42:50,535 --> 00:42:51,336
Get outta here.

1102
00:42:56,407 --> 00:42:57,909
May we have your
attention, please.

1103
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:00,011
Can we have the
bride down front?

1104
00:43:00,111 --> 00:43:00,846
Gina, please.

1105
00:43:00,946 --> 00:43:02,648
Have a seat in the chair, huh?

1106
00:43:06,151 --> 00:43:08,787
Now, since we had no
budget for a band--

1107
00:43:08,887 --> 00:43:10,856
And I am practically
out of songs--

1108
00:43:10,956 --> 00:43:12,691
Please allow us
to present to you,

1109
00:43:12,791 --> 00:43:14,893
live on stage for
the very first time--

1110
00:43:14,993 --> 00:43:17,095
And maybe the last time.

1111
00:43:17,195 --> 00:43:18,396
Ladies and gentlemen--

1112
00:43:18,496 --> 00:43:20,298
Please give a
warm welcome to--

1113
00:43:20,398 --> 00:43:21,232
(TOGETHER) Gina's Boys.

1114
00:43:26,805 --> 00:43:28,740
What are you guys gonna do?

1115
00:43:28,840 --> 00:43:30,275
(SINGING) Ooga
ooga ooga chacka.

1116
00:43:30,375 --> 00:43:36,982
(SINGING) I can't stop this
feeling, deep inside of me.

1117
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:41,920
Girl you just don't
realize what you do to me.

1118
00:43:42,020 --> 00:43:45,757
(TOGETHER; SINGING) When you
hold me in your arms so tight,

1119
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:49,661
you let me know
everything's all right.

1120
00:43:52,831 --> 00:43:55,867
I'm hooked on a feeling.

1121
00:43:55,967 --> 00:43:58,704
well i don't believe it.

1122
00:43:58,804 --> 00:44:00,405
That you're in love with me.

1123
00:44:04,810 --> 00:44:07,679
Lips as sweet as can be.

1124
00:44:07,779 --> 00:44:11,149
It's taste is on my mind.

1125
00:44:11,249 --> 00:44:17,188
Girl you got me thirsty
for another cup of wine.

1126
00:44:27,032 --> 00:44:27,866
Wow.

1127
00:44:32,637 --> 00:44:35,907
Congratulations Mr. Esposito.

1128
00:44:36,007 --> 00:44:38,309
Congratulations to
you Mrs. Esposito.

1129
00:44:45,751 --> 00:44:46,718
You're not really
going to play

1130
00:44:46,818 --> 00:44:48,686
football tomorrow, are you?

1131
00:44:48,787 --> 00:44:50,956
I have to.

1132
00:44:51,056 --> 00:44:54,425
Sure I can't change your mind?

1133
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,393
Hmm?

1134
00:44:55,493 --> 00:45:02,233
Well-- you can try.

1135
00:45:02,333 --> 00:45:11,476
Okay

1136
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:12,377
Come here.

1137
00:45:16,681 --> 00:45:18,083
[whistle blowing]

1138
00:45:18,183 --> 00:45:19,017
Aw, Sal.

1139
00:45:19,117 --> 00:45:21,419
Stop blowing the
whistle, will you?

1140
00:45:21,519 --> 00:45:22,553
I'm practicing.

1141
00:45:22,653 --> 00:45:24,522
Go practice over
there, please.

1142
00:45:24,622 --> 00:45:26,224
[speaking italian]

1143
00:45:26,324 --> 00:45:27,959
Jesus.

1144
00:45:28,059 --> 00:45:29,795
Where the hell's JJ?
Did you call him?

1145
00:45:29,895 --> 00:45:31,362
Yeah I called him.

1146
00:45:31,462 --> 00:45:32,663
Was he sleeping?

1147
00:45:32,764 --> 00:45:33,564
He was out cold.

1148
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:35,433
Sound like he was dead.

1149
00:45:35,533 --> 00:45:36,768
Louie, is he coming?

1150
00:45:36,868 --> 00:45:38,336
Yeah, he's on his way.

1151
00:45:38,436 --> 00:45:39,270
Hey, here they come.

1152
00:45:39,370 --> 00:45:40,205
Get up.

1153
00:45:42,640 --> 00:45:43,641
Holy shit.

1154
00:45:43,741 --> 00:45:45,643
Look at the size of these guys.

1155
00:45:45,743 --> 00:45:46,845
We're in trouble.

1156
00:45:46,945 --> 00:46:02,961
[intense music]

1157
00:46:03,061 --> 00:46:04,529
Where's the ref at?

1158
00:46:04,629 --> 00:46:08,366
He's over there
eating his breakfast.

1159
00:46:08,466 --> 00:46:09,567
Is that him?

1160
00:46:09,667 --> 00:46:10,869
Are you sure he knows
what he's doing?

1161
00:46:10,969 --> 00:46:12,203
Sure he does.

1162
00:46:12,303 --> 00:46:13,738
He coached for 22 years.
- All right, all right.

1163
00:46:13,839 --> 00:46:15,040
Well where's that loud
mouthed Puerto Rican at?

1164
00:46:15,140 --> 00:46:16,474
He ain't here yet.
We'll start without him.

1165
00:46:16,574 --> 00:46:17,475
Sit a man.
- Yo, man.

1166
00:46:17,575 --> 00:46:18,844
Well it's still $200 a man.

1167
00:46:18,944 --> 00:46:20,211
Whether he shows or not.
All right?

1168
00:46:20,311 --> 00:46:21,146
You're covered.

1169
00:46:23,281 --> 00:46:24,115
Go.

1170
00:46:29,387 --> 00:46:31,489
I got a score
for him right here.

1171
00:46:53,144 --> 00:46:54,812
[slam]

1172
00:46:54,913 --> 00:46:57,048
Hey get off him.

1173
00:46:57,148 --> 00:46:58,083
You OK?

1174
00:46:58,183 --> 00:46:59,317
I thought we were
playing touch, man.

1175
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:00,618
Don't worry,
we'll get him back.

1176
00:47:00,718 --> 00:47:02,287
Gimme your hand.

1177
00:47:02,387 --> 00:47:07,225
[sighs]

1178
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,226
[whistle blows]

1179
00:47:08,326 --> 00:47:09,127
Halftime.

1180
00:47:20,805 --> 00:47:22,908
Sorry I'm late fellas.
What's the score?

1181
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,943
21-7 and they're up JJ.

1182
00:47:25,043 --> 00:47:26,411
Holy fuck they're big.

1183
00:47:26,511 --> 00:47:27,345
Eh.

1184
00:47:27,445 --> 00:47:29,047
Try blocking them.

1185
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,715
Come on guys we're in.
Let's go.

1186
00:47:30,815 --> 00:47:31,616
Let's go.

1187
00:47:34,685 --> 00:47:35,753
This time block them, huh?

1188
00:47:35,853 --> 00:47:37,722
Mad at me, Joey?

1189
00:47:37,822 --> 00:47:38,756
Fuck you.

1190
00:47:38,856 --> 00:47:39,657
Come on.

1191
00:47:39,757 --> 00:47:41,592
I overslept.

1192
00:47:41,692 --> 00:47:43,194
Let's kick their ass

1193
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:43,895
Let's do it.

1194
00:47:43,995 --> 00:47:56,774
[whistle blows]

1195
00:47:56,874 --> 00:47:58,376
Yo, Sammy, that's one.

1196
00:47:58,476 --> 00:48:01,846
You see that shit?

1197
00:48:01,947 --> 00:48:02,981
Yeah.

1198
00:48:09,454 --> 00:48:52,030
-

1199
00:48:52,130 --> 00:48:54,732
Sal, How much time?

1200
00:48:54,832 --> 00:48:56,101
8 seconds left.

1201
00:48:56,201 --> 00:48:57,235
it's the fourth down.

1202
00:48:57,335 --> 00:48:58,303
Last play.

1203
00:48:58,403 --> 00:49:00,271
You guys don't score
now, it's no blood.

1204
00:49:00,371 --> 00:49:02,440
Capiche?

1205
00:49:02,540 --> 00:49:03,674
Let's go.

1206
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:05,110
JJ, can-- can you throw?

1207
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:06,744
- Shit yeah.
- All right.

1208
00:49:06,844 --> 00:49:07,712
Give me a reverse.

1209
00:49:07,812 --> 00:49:09,247
They'll think it's a run.

1210
00:49:09,347 --> 00:49:10,415
I'll be all alone on the left
hand side of the end zone.

1211
00:49:10,515 --> 00:49:11,582
Get it to me.
- I'll put it there.

1212
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:12,517
Let's go.

1213
00:49:14,252 --> 00:49:15,486
Let's go baby.
come on, Let's go.

1214
00:49:18,623 --> 00:49:19,457
Watch him on the outside.

1215
00:49:22,427 --> 00:49:23,228
Red.

1216
00:49:23,328 --> 00:49:24,429
Set.

1217
00:49:24,529 --> 00:49:25,496
Blue one.

1218
00:49:25,596 --> 00:49:26,431
Hike.

1219
00:49:41,546 --> 00:49:42,347
Touchdown.

1220
00:49:42,447 --> 00:49:43,148
Game.

1221
00:49:43,248 --> 00:49:44,749
You all right, Joey?

1222
00:49:44,849 --> 00:49:47,818
Joey, you OK?

1223
00:49:47,918 --> 00:49:50,788
You all right?

1224
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:54,392
Be a lot better
when you pay me.

1225
00:49:54,492 --> 00:49:55,360
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1226
00:49:58,563 --> 00:49:59,464
Next time.

1227
00:49:59,564 --> 00:50:01,299
We're going for
pizza, you want to come?

1228
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:03,934
Actually, I was thinking
of a little macaroni

1229
00:50:04,035 --> 00:50:05,870
over at the Espositio house.

1230
00:50:05,970 --> 00:50:06,804
Don't push it.

1231
00:50:06,904 --> 00:50:07,705
Good throw.

1232
00:50:20,618 --> 00:50:24,655
[knocking]

1233
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:26,591
Hey.

1234
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:28,259
Hey, what's up, kid?

1235
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,494
Here's today's bets, Paul.

1236
00:50:29,594 --> 00:50:30,328
Yeah?

1237
00:50:30,428 --> 00:50:32,197
What about that used car guy?

1238
00:50:32,297 --> 00:50:33,631
I'm on it.
?

1239
00:50:33,731 --> 00:50:35,133
Look.
Do me a favor.

1240
00:50:35,233 --> 00:50:36,867
If that broad, Connie,
comes in here you tell her,

1241
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:38,336
I'm not here.
All right?

1242
00:50:38,436 --> 00:50:39,204
You got it.

1243
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,572
Bitch has been
calling all day.

1244
00:50:41,672 --> 00:50:42,507
Hey.

1245
00:50:42,607 --> 00:50:43,741
How you doing?

1246
00:50:43,841 --> 00:50:45,943
It's Louie's birthday,
man, I forgot all about it.

1247
00:50:46,043 --> 00:50:47,178
Yeah, me too.

1248
00:50:47,278 --> 00:50:48,313
Don't tell him we
told you, all right?

1249
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:49,580
- No.
- You know what we'll do?

1250
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:50,848
Go out to dinner tonight.
We'll celebrate.

1251
00:50:50,948 --> 00:50:52,350
We'll bring the girls.
- Yeah.

1252
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,418
I'm going to the Bathroom.
I'll meet you at the bar.

1253
00:50:53,518 --> 00:50:54,319
- Want a drink?
- You buying?

1254
00:51:03,094 --> 00:51:05,563
[tapping]

1255
00:51:05,663 --> 00:51:09,534

Give us a couple of scotches.

1258
00:51:11,702 --> 00:51:13,070
We're celebrating
my buddy's birthday.

Sal, Jay whatever he wants.

1267
00:51:26,384 --> 00:51:28,353
This is his fifth
one in the last hour.

1268
00:51:28,453 --> 00:51:29,187
Hey.

1269
00:51:29,287 --> 00:51:30,455
What're you keeping count, man?

Standing around for an hour
with my thumb up my ass.

1277
00:51:40,365 --> 00:51:41,299
This guy's never, ever there.

1278
00:51:41,399 --> 00:51:42,400
Well do me a favor.

1279
00:51:42,500 --> 00:51:43,201
Keep trying.

1280
00:51:43,301 --> 00:51:44,502
Pauley's breaking my balls.

1281
00:51:44,602 --> 00:51:46,504
What do you want to
do today, birthday boy?

1282
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:48,105
I thought we'd go to
dinner with the girls.

1283
00:51:48,206 --> 00:51:49,307
What do you think?

1284
00:51:49,407 --> 00:51:51,041
You like this girl, huh Louie?

1285
00:51:51,142 --> 00:51:51,976
It's not like that.

1286
00:51:52,076 --> 00:51:53,211
She's a nice girl, JJ.

1287
00:51:53,311 --> 00:51:54,512
They're all nice girls.

1288
00:51:54,612 --> 00:51:55,713
Right, Sally?

1289
00:51:55,813 --> 00:51:56,881
But, if she had a heart,
she'd be giving you some.

1290
00:51:56,981 --> 00:51:58,183
Come on.

1291
00:51:58,283 --> 00:51:59,884
We're taking it slow, all right?
- Hey Sally.

1292
00:51:59,984 --> 00:52:01,419
One for the road.

1293
00:52:01,519 --> 00:52:02,853
One more and you
won't see the road.

1294
00:52:02,953 --> 00:52:03,888
It's OK.

1295
00:52:03,988 --> 00:52:05,089
I don't need to see the road.

1296
00:52:05,190 --> 00:52:08,125
Hey, so where are we going?

1297
00:52:08,226 --> 00:52:09,227
Hunt's Point?

1298
00:52:09,327 --> 00:52:10,395
I'm not going to Hunt's Point.

1299
00:52:10,495 --> 00:52:11,629
No way.
- Yes you are.

1300

It's your birthday.
Take care, Sally.

1301
00:52:12,997 --> 00:52:13,931

1302
00:52:14,031 --> 00:52:15,099
Hey.

Hey.
Don't forget to use a rubber.

1304
00:52:16,801 --> 00:52:17,702
All right, Sal.

1305
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,035
You got shit luck, Louie.

1306
00:52:51,135 --> 00:52:52,136
Not a hooker around.

1307
00:52:52,237 --> 00:52:53,304
Listen, guys.

1308
00:52:53,404 --> 00:52:54,705
I'm not going

All right?

1310
00:52:56,073 --> 00:52:58,509
We're going to hose her
down real good for you, Louie.

1311
00:52:58,609 --> 00:53:00,177
Maybe we should check
the west side highway.

1312
00:53:00,278 --> 00:53:01,612
First, check
around this corner.

1313
00:53:06,984 --> 00:53:07,785

1326
00:53:40,418 --> 00:53:41,752
Do you take credit card?

1327
00:53:41,852 --> 00:53:42,920
Cash only.

1328
00:53:43,020 --> 00:53:44,889

1329
00:53:44,989 --> 00:53:46,491
Hey, hey.

00:53:47,725 --> 00:53:48,493
Here's the 40.

1332
00:53:48,593 --> 00:53:49,794
But you better be good.

1333
00:53:49,894 --> 00:53:50,795
Pull up there.

1334
00:53:50,895 --> 00:53:51,662
Only, you two gotta get out.

1336
00:53:52,697 --> 00:53:53,664
We can't watch?

1337
00:53:53,764 --> 00:53:54,565
No.

1338
00:53:57,968 --> 00:53:59,937
She got some ass, Louie.

1339
00:54:00,037 --> 00:54:01,906
Some rack, too.

1340
00:54:02,006 --> 00:54:04,008
Let's go.

1341
00:54:04,108 --> 00:54:04,942
Happy birthday, Louie.

1342
00:54:11,616 --> 00:54:13,083
Don't cum all over
the seats, Louie.

1343
00:54:13,183 --> 00:54:14,018
Hey don't worry about it.

1344
00:54:16,521 --> 00:54:17,154
Hi.

1345

OK, Joey.

1348
00:54:23,027 --> 00:54:25,696
But this would be a lot easier
if you took your pants down.

1349
00:54:25,796 --> 00:54:26,597
Oh.

1350
00:54:32,570 --> 00:54:33,738
OK.

1351
00:54:33,838 --> 00:54:35,205
You can touch my tits but
you only get two minutes.

1352
00:54:35,306 --> 00:54:36,441
So concentrate.

1353

honey, concentrate.

1354
00:54:46,250 --> 00:54:47,284

Nah, I'm OK.

1437
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:25,202
Let me lie here.

1438
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:27,071
Are you sure?

1439
00:58:27,171 --> 00:58:28,038
Got any of that pain stuff?

1440
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:42,452
Hey, JJ.

1441
00:58:42,553 --> 00:58:43,621
Where you been?

1442
00:58:43,721 --> 00:58:45,089
You look like shit.

1443
00:58:45,189 --> 00:58:46,557
I just got reamed by
Lisette for three hours, man.

1444
00:58:46,657 --> 00:58:47,958
I don't need it from you guys.
All right?

1445
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:49,093
Oh yeah?

1446
00:58:49,193 --> 00:58:50,327
That's too bad because
she rang that freakin'

1447
00:58:50,427 --> 00:58:51,528
phone off the hook last night.

1448
00:58:51,629 --> 00:58:52,830
I ain't get any
sleep because of you.

1449
00:58:52,930 --> 00:58:54,198
- So where were you?
- I was out with Carlos.

1450
00:58:54,298 --> 00:58:55,399
We were drinking. i
crashed at his place, man.

1451
00:58:55,499 --> 00:58:58,135
It's no big deal.

1452
00:58:58,235 --> 00:58:59,069
Want a beer?

1453
00:59:01,639 --> 00:59:04,241
Yo, Mr. M. You
got any brioche?

1454
00:59:04,341 --> 00:59:05,409
What's the matter?

1455
00:59:05,509 --> 00:59:08,378
Rough night?

1456
00:59:08,478 --> 00:59:10,514
What time did you get home?

1457
00:59:10,615 --> 00:59:12,382
About nine this morning.

1458
00:59:12,482 --> 00:59:13,718
How was Lisette?

1459
00:59:13,818 --> 00:59:15,152
Standing at the door
with a bat in her hand.

1460
00:59:15,252 --> 00:59:17,254
Salute.

1461
00:59:17,354 --> 00:59:20,224
- So, What did you tell her?
- Told her the truth.

1462
00:59:20,324 --> 00:59:22,727
Had too much to drink and
crashed at my cousin's place.

1463
00:59:22,827 --> 00:59:23,694
What are you doing today?

1464
00:59:23,794 --> 00:59:24,962
Going home to sleep, man.

1465
00:59:25,062 --> 00:59:26,463
I'm fucking beat.
- Well do me a favor.

1466
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:27,898
How about going to see
Barry first, to see

1467
00:59:27,998 --> 00:59:29,667
he's got our money.
- I'll take care of it tomorrow.

1468
00:59:29,767 --> 00:59:30,901
All right?
- No.

1469
00:59:31,001 --> 00:59:32,036
It's not all right.
It's been a week.

1470
00:59:32,136 --> 00:59:33,638
Pauley wants his money.
All right.

1471
00:59:33,738 --> 00:59:34,471
Forget about it all right
I'll take care of it.

1472
00:59:34,571 --> 00:59:35,806
Hey.

1473
00:59:35,906 --> 00:59:36,774
I said I'll take care of
it tomorrow, all right.

1474
00:59:36,874 --> 00:59:39,409
It's no fucking big deal.

1475
00:59:39,509 --> 00:59:40,678
See you guys later, man.

1476
00:59:43,681 --> 00:59:45,415
What's his fucking problem?

1477
00:59:45,515 --> 00:59:46,450
I don't know, Joey.

1478
00:59:46,550 --> 00:59:48,318
He's been acting weird lately.

1479
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:49,319
Hey.

1480
00:59:49,419 --> 00:59:50,220
Well i gotta get this money.

1481
00:59:50,320 --> 00:59:51,922
You want to take a ride?

1482
00:59:52,022 --> 00:59:53,691
Yeah, sure.

1483
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:55,325
See ya, Pops.

1484
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:56,293
Hey, Junior.

1485
00:59:56,393 --> 00:59:57,695
What?

1486
00:59:57,795 --> 00:59:59,196
When are you going to
do some work around here?

1487
00:59:59,296 --> 01:00:00,497
I need a rest, you know?

1488
01:00:00,597 --> 01:00:02,366
Pops, [non-english]
I'll close up tonight.

1489
01:00:11,008 --> 01:00:12,242
Bet Pauley would love this.

1490
01:00:12,342 --> 01:00:13,177
Yeah.

1491
01:00:13,277 --> 01:00:14,111
He would.

1492
01:00:19,216 --> 01:00:19,850
Hey.

1493
01:00:19,950 --> 01:00:22,052
Who set off the lights?

1494
01:00:22,152 --> 01:00:22,787
Jesus Christ.

1495
01:00:22,887 --> 01:00:23,988
You're finally here.

1496
01:00:24,088 --> 01:00:25,189
What do you mean,
I'm finally here?

1497
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,156
I'm always here.

1498
01:00:26,256 --> 01:00:27,457
I'm married to this place.

1499
01:00:27,557 --> 01:00:28,358
Congratulations.

1500
01:00:28,458 --> 01:00:29,526
We're real proud of you.

1501
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:30,728
And, Barry, what
the fuck's going

1502
01:00:30,828 --> 01:00:32,262
on between you and Pauley?
- Pauley?

1503
01:00:32,362 --> 01:00:33,864
I got no problem with Pauley.
- All right.

1504
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:35,232
Listen to me.
You're a good guy.

1505
01:00:35,332 --> 01:00:36,166
Don't piss him off.

1506
01:00:36,266 --> 01:00:37,201
Just pay him the money.

1507
01:00:37,301 --> 01:00:38,969
I paid Pauley.

1508
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:39,670
You paid who?

1509
01:00:39,770 --> 01:00:40,905
You paid Pauley?

1510
01:00:41,005 --> 01:00:41,872
No.

1511
01:00:41,972 --> 01:00:44,675
I gave the money
to JJ last week.

1512
01:00:44,775 --> 01:00:46,343
You gave the money to JJ?

1513
01:00:46,443 --> 01:00:47,444
On my kids.

1514
01:00:47,544 --> 01:00:50,280
I gave JJ $500 last week.

1515
01:00:52,783 --> 01:00:53,851
All right, Barry,
we'll straighten

1516
01:00:53,951 --> 01:00:55,720
this out with Pauley for you.

1517
01:00:55,820 --> 01:00:57,187
Well I hope you do.

1518
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:58,889
This ain't gonna lass
up my credit will it?

1519
01:00:58,989 --> 01:01:01,458
I told you, we'll
will take care of it.

1520
01:01:01,558 --> 01:01:02,626
Hey, Bar.

1521
01:01:02,727 --> 01:01:04,428
What's in the box?

1522
01:01:04,528 --> 01:01:05,362
The box?

1523
01:01:05,462 --> 01:01:06,663
Yeah.

1524
01:01:06,764 --> 01:01:07,664
It's a dishwasher.

1525
01:01:07,765 --> 01:01:08,766
Brand new.

1526
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:14,338
Here we are.

1527
01:01:14,438 --> 01:01:16,273
Wow that smells great.

1528
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:17,541
So, Louie.

1529
01:01:17,641 --> 01:01:19,509
I hear you're in love.

1530
01:01:19,609 --> 01:01:21,311
I hear she's a wonderful girl.

1531
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:22,612
And a doctor.
- Yeah.

1532
01:01:22,713 --> 01:01:23,547
She's really special.

1533
01:01:23,647 --> 01:01:25,382
We get along great, too.

1534
01:01:25,482 --> 01:01:26,583
Well, don't rush
into anything.

1535
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,252
Be careful.

1536
01:01:28,352 --> 01:01:29,386
Thanks.

1537
01:01:29,486 --> 01:01:30,955
Don't worry
about this guy, ma.

1538
01:01:31,055 --> 01:01:32,556
He can't even make
up his mind when

1539
01:01:32,656 --> 01:01:34,258
he gets dressed in the morning.
Louie ain't rushing to nothing.

1540
01:01:34,358 --> 01:01:35,793
Just take your time.

1541
01:01:35,893 --> 01:01:36,727
You're a good boy.

1542
01:01:36,827 --> 01:01:38,262
You deserve the best.

1543
01:01:38,362 --> 01:01:39,296
Thanks Mrs. E.

1544
01:01:39,396 --> 01:01:40,230
Wait a minute.

1545
01:01:40,330 --> 01:01:41,031
I forgot.

1546
01:01:41,131 --> 01:01:42,299
Where's the third musketeer?

1547
01:01:42,399 --> 01:01:43,233
He's not feeling too good.

1548
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:44,168
He's at home.

1549
01:01:46,636 --> 01:01:48,839
What's in the box?

1550
01:01:48,939 --> 01:01:51,441
Joey bought us a dishwasher.

1551
01:01:51,541 --> 01:01:53,110
A dishwasher.

1552
01:01:53,210 --> 01:01:54,378
From the big shot.

1553
01:01:54,478 --> 01:01:55,645
What?

1554
01:01:55,746 --> 01:01:57,447
Did it fall off a truck, Joey?
- Be nice.

1555
01:01:57,547 --> 01:01:59,449
He worked hard for
that dishwasher.

1556
01:01:59,549 --> 01:02:00,450
Worked hard?

1557
01:02:00,550 --> 01:02:01,718
He probably hit the numbers.

1558
01:02:01,819 --> 01:02:03,187
This kid never worked
hard in his life.

1559
01:02:03,287 --> 01:02:05,422
And what's wrong with the
washer I bought you, huh?

1560
01:02:05,522 --> 01:02:06,323
Come on, pop.

1561
01:02:06,423 --> 01:02:07,657
Things an antique.

1562
01:02:07,758 --> 01:02:08,725
That's something that
worked when the Dodger's

1563
01:02:08,826 --> 01:02:11,361
were still playing in Brooklyn.

1564
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:12,396
That's funny?

1565
01:02:12,496 --> 01:02:13,530
Hey.

1566
01:02:13,630 --> 01:02:14,564
You bought that
with dirty money.

1567
01:02:14,664 --> 01:02:15,900
I don't want it in the house.

1568
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,835
It's a gift from our
son, and it's staying.

1569
01:02:17,935 --> 01:02:19,636
Don't disrespect me.

1570
01:02:19,736 --> 01:02:20,704
This is my house.

1571
01:02:20,805 --> 01:02:22,039
What I say goes.
I pay the bills.

1572
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:22,739
Not him.

1573
01:02:22,840 --> 01:02:23,673
That's enough.

1574
01:02:23,774 --> 01:02:24,574
Shut up.

1575
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:25,876
Stop yelling at her.

1576
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,244
You've been doing
it all my life.

1577
01:02:27,344 --> 01:02:28,145
I'm tired of it.

1578
01:02:28,245 --> 01:02:29,179
No more.

1579
01:02:29,279 --> 01:02:30,480
You're right.

1580
01:02:30,580 --> 01:02:33,417
I ain't proud of what I do,
but I do what I gotta do.

1581
01:02:33,517 --> 01:02:34,751
I always took care of myself.

1582
01:02:34,852 --> 01:02:37,321
I never asked you for
nothing I ain't gonna

1583
01:02:37,421 --> 01:02:39,223
work for Tony forever, pop.

1584
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:42,126
I'm going to open up that
bar with Louie and JJ.

1585
01:02:42,226 --> 01:02:44,328
I'm gonna show
you I ain't a bum.

1586
01:02:48,165 --> 01:02:48,966
Louie.

1587
01:02:49,066 --> 01:02:50,734
Come on.

1588
01:02:50,835 --> 01:02:52,502
Thanks for the food
Mrs. E. It was great.

1589
01:02:52,602 --> 01:02:53,403
Any time.

1590
01:03:01,345 --> 01:03:02,146
I'll hook it up later.

1591
01:03:13,623 --> 01:03:14,859
Hey, JJ.

1592
01:03:14,959 --> 01:03:16,526
You missed a great
meal at Joey's mom's.

1593
01:03:16,626 --> 01:03:17,494
She was asking about you.

1594
01:03:19,997 --> 01:03:21,765
You guys want a drink?

1595
01:03:21,866 --> 01:03:23,000
Hey, Jay.

1596
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,634
What's going on with you, man?

1597
01:03:24,734 --> 01:03:25,669
I mean look at you.

1598
01:03:25,769 --> 01:03:26,570
You're drinking all the time.

1599
01:03:26,670 --> 01:03:27,637
I see you doing Coke.

1600
01:03:27,737 --> 01:03:28,839
Talk to me.
- I'm fine.

1601
01:03:28,939 --> 01:03:29,874
I'm OK, man.
- No.

1602
01:03:29,974 --> 01:03:31,408
You're not OK.

1603
01:03:31,508 --> 01:03:33,310
I got your mother and your
girlfriend calling me all night

1604
01:03:33,410 --> 01:03:34,044
long.

1605
01:03:34,144 --> 01:03:35,379
What's going on?
- Hey.

1606
01:03:35,479 --> 01:03:36,713
Let me tell you something.

1607
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:37,882
I can take care of my
mother my girlfriend.

1608
01:03:37,982 --> 01:03:39,183
Mind your own fucking business.
OK?

1609
01:03:39,283 --> 01:03:40,150
Hey.
Hey.

1610
01:03:40,250 --> 01:03:41,718
Hey.
Mind my own fucking business?

1611
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,387
How about I go tell Pauley,
right now, you stole from him?

1612
01:03:43,487 --> 01:03:44,421
Fuck you.

1613
01:03:44,521 --> 01:03:45,789
I know Barry give you the money.

1614
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:47,457
I'm your brother.
How could you do this to me?

1615
01:03:47,557 --> 01:03:48,358
Fuck you.

1616
01:03:48,458 --> 01:03:51,461
And fuck Pauley.

1617
01:03:51,561 --> 01:03:52,729
What's the matter with you?

1618
01:03:52,829 --> 01:03:56,033
You broke my watch,
you fucking scumbag.

1619
01:03:56,133 --> 01:03:57,501
JJ, where you going?

1620
01:03:57,601 --> 01:03:59,669
Give me a drink.

1621
01:03:59,769 --> 01:04:01,071
Joey.

1622
01:04:01,171 --> 01:04:04,108
There's obviously something
wrong with him, man.

1623
01:04:04,208 --> 01:04:05,109
Hey.

1624
01:04:05,209 --> 01:04:06,443
You guys are supposed
to be friends.

1625
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:14,018
Bubbles, you want
something to drink?

1626
01:04:14,118 --> 01:04:15,285
Espresso?
Anything?

1627
01:04:15,385 --> 01:04:16,220
No.

1628
01:04:16,320 --> 01:04:17,721
I'm OK Joey.

1629
01:04:17,821 --> 01:04:18,889
Maybe an espresso.

1630
01:04:18,989 --> 01:04:20,090
Come on.

1631
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,892
Let's get this show on the road.

1632
01:04:21,992 --> 01:04:23,793
Hey, relax tough guy.
Just give us a minute.

1633
01:04:23,894 --> 01:04:25,930
OK?

1634
01:04:26,030 --> 01:04:28,999
You sure you could
beat this guy?

1635
01:04:29,099 --> 01:04:31,501
It's a lot of
pressure on me Joey.

1636
01:04:31,601 --> 01:04:32,436
No-- No pressure.

1637
01:04:32,536 --> 01:04:33,603
Louie rub his shoulders.

1638
01:04:33,703 --> 01:04:34,838
There's no pressure on you.

1639
01:04:34,939 --> 01:04:36,073
Hey.

1640
01:04:36,173 --> 01:04:37,641
Not for nothing, but
if you guys think

1641
01:04:37,741 --> 01:04:40,010
I'm going to wait around all
day, you can forget about it.

1642
01:04:40,110 --> 01:04:42,779
Stop putting pressure
on him, will you?

1643
01:04:42,879 --> 01:04:43,847
Forget the espresso.

1644
01:04:43,948 --> 01:04:45,015
It will make you choke.
- Yeah.

1645
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,550
Yeah.
- Listen to me.

1646
01:04:46,650 --> 01:04:50,620
I never saw this guy before.
you sure he ain't a ringer?

1647
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:52,422
I can beat him Joey.

1648
01:04:52,522 --> 01:04:53,457
OK.

1649
01:04:53,557 --> 01:04:54,992
I got 250 on this game.

1650
01:04:55,092 --> 01:04:56,126
Do I make it 500?

1651
01:04:58,728 --> 01:04:59,629
Yeah.

1652
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,265
You sure?

1653
01:05:01,365 --> 01:05:02,199
Yeah.

1654
01:05:02,299 --> 01:05:03,233
I'm sure.

1655
01:05:03,333 --> 01:05:05,402
OK.

1656
01:05:05,502 --> 01:05:07,037
No pressure.
- No.

1657
01:05:07,137 --> 01:05:08,538
No pressure.
- You're cool?

1658
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:09,606
I'm cool.

1659
01:05:09,706 --> 01:05:11,675
Real calm.

1660
01:05:11,775 --> 01:05:14,211
Real calm, huh?

1661
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:15,579
500!

1662
01:05:15,679 --> 01:05:18,882
[cheering]

1663
01:05:18,983 --> 01:05:19,849
Joey.

1664
01:05:19,950 --> 01:05:21,285
Lisette.

1665
01:05:21,385 --> 01:05:22,386
It's JJ.

1666
01:05:22,486 --> 01:05:24,788
He hasn't been home in two days.
I'm worried.

1667
01:05:24,888 --> 01:05:25,922
I know something has happened.

1668
01:05:26,023 --> 01:05:26,890
Don't worry.

1669
01:05:26,991 --> 01:05:28,325
He's probably with Carlos.

1670
01:05:28,425 --> 01:05:31,195
No I called Carlos,
Carlos hasn't heard from JJ.

1671
01:05:31,295 --> 01:05:31,928
OK.

1672
01:05:32,029 --> 01:05:33,063
Just calm down.

1673
01:05:33,163 --> 01:05:34,431
Me and Joey we'll
go look for him.

1674
01:05:34,531 --> 01:05:36,133
Don't worry.

1675
01:05:36,233 --> 01:05:39,069
There's something
you two should know.

1676
01:05:39,169 --> 01:05:40,904
JJ's been doing drugs.

1677
01:05:41,005 --> 01:05:42,406
Do you mean the coke?

1678
01:05:42,506 --> 01:05:43,640
No.

1679
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:45,275
JJ's been doing heroin.

1680
01:05:45,375 --> 01:05:45,976
Heroin?

1681
01:05:46,076 --> 01:05:48,178
Why didn't you tell us?

1682
01:05:48,278 --> 01:05:50,014
He said he had
it under control.

1683
01:05:50,114 --> 01:05:53,150
He made me-- he made me
promise not to tell anyone.

1684
01:05:53,250 --> 01:05:54,218
Who's he doing it with?

1685
01:05:54,318 --> 01:05:55,519
He's been doing
it with Carlos,

1686
01:05:55,619 --> 01:05:58,455
but Carlos hasn't heard
from JJ in two days.

1687
01:05:58,555 --> 01:06:00,724
He thinks he went to
Hunt's Point to cop it.

1688
01:06:00,824 --> 01:06:01,491
OK.
Listen.

1689
01:06:01,591 --> 01:06:02,526
You stay home.

1690
01:06:02,626 --> 01:06:03,660
Stay by the phone,
and we'll find him.

1691
01:06:03,760 --> 01:06:04,528
Don't worry.
- No.

1692
01:06:04,628 --> 01:06:05,662
I want to go.

1693
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:06,663
Listen to me.

1694
01:06:06,763 --> 01:06:07,998
You stay home by the phone.

1695
01:06:08,098 --> 01:06:09,199
If JJ calls, you beep me.

1696
01:06:09,299 --> 01:06:09,933
OK?

1697
01:06:10,034 --> 01:06:10,867
Don't worry.

1698
01:06:10,967 --> 01:06:12,369
We'll find him.

1699
01:06:12,469 --> 01:06:15,772
Call me if you
hear anything, huh?

1700
01:06:15,872 --> 01:06:17,241
Hey, Anthony.

1701
01:06:17,341 --> 01:06:18,608
You know JJ's cousin, Carlos?
- Yeah.

1702
01:06:18,708 --> 01:06:19,743
What about him?

1703
01:06:19,843 --> 01:06:21,011
Where's his after
hours joint at?

1704
01:06:21,111 --> 01:06:23,813
It's over there by
Zerega and Tremont.

1705
01:06:23,913 --> 01:06:25,782
What's the matter?

1706
01:06:25,882 --> 01:06:27,517
Pete, you want to take a ride?

1707
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:28,285
Sure, Joey.

1708
01:06:28,385 --> 01:06:29,486
- What's up?
- Come on.

1709
01:06:29,586 --> 01:06:30,420
Let's go.

1710
01:06:34,091 --> 01:06:35,392
All right.
You want a game?

1711
01:06:35,492 --> 01:06:36,293
You got a game.

1712
01:06:36,393 --> 01:06:37,227
Here we go.

1713
01:06:46,436 --> 01:06:48,338
Hey.

1714
01:06:48,438 --> 01:06:49,673
Look who it is.

1715
01:06:49,773 --> 01:06:53,177
But I already told that bitch,
I don't know where he is.

1716
01:06:55,479 --> 01:06:57,981
You could get killed for
doing that shit around here.

1717
01:06:58,082 --> 01:06:58,915
Yeah?

1718
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,884
Yeah.

1719
01:07:00,984 --> 01:07:02,319
Where's JJ?

1720
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:04,988
I'm gonna tell you the
same thing I told his girl.

1721
01:07:05,089 --> 01:07:07,491
He's probably at Hunt's Point.

1722
01:07:07,591 --> 01:07:08,658
Where in Hunt's Point?

1723
01:07:08,758 --> 01:07:10,160
Where in Hunt's Point?

1724
01:07:12,729 --> 01:07:14,198
Try Hunt's Point Avenue.

1725
01:07:14,298 --> 01:07:16,066
There's a warehouse
in the market.

1726
01:07:16,166 --> 01:07:18,102
It's a big grey-brown building.

1727
01:07:18,202 --> 01:07:20,104
If I ever find out you
give him anything again,

1728
01:07:20,204 --> 01:07:21,705
I'll fucking kill you.

1729
01:07:21,805 --> 01:07:22,639
Oh--

1730
01:07:28,145 --> 01:07:30,046
Carlos, you OK?
You OK?

1731
01:07:30,147 --> 01:07:31,648
What fucking good are you bro?

1732
01:08:29,038 --> 01:08:29,939
Check there.

1733
01:08:30,039 --> 01:08:31,141
All right.

1734
01:08:52,596 --> 01:08:53,230
Joey.

1735
01:08:53,330 --> 01:08:54,364
He's over here.

1736
01:09:29,098 --> 01:09:31,901
This will make
him feel better.

1737
01:09:32,001 --> 01:09:32,802
He doesn't look too good.

1738
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:44,113
He took a bad
dose of something.

1739
01:09:44,214 --> 01:09:46,516
His body's rejecting it.

1740
01:09:46,616 --> 01:09:48,818
You sure he's
got to go to rehab?

1741
01:09:48,918 --> 01:09:50,220
He's addicted, Joey.

1742
01:09:50,320 --> 01:09:51,455
He needs to clean out.

1743
01:09:54,023 --> 01:09:54,824
Louie.

1744
01:09:57,894 --> 01:10:00,797
[vomiting]

1745
01:10:00,897 --> 01:10:15,144
[coughing]

1746
01:10:15,245 --> 01:10:16,079
Sit up.

1747
01:10:16,179 --> 01:10:18,582
Hey.

1748
01:10:18,682 --> 01:10:20,317
Welcome back.

1749
01:10:20,417 --> 01:10:23,253
How you feeling?

1750
01:10:23,353 --> 01:10:24,220
I'm cold.

1751
01:10:24,321 --> 01:10:25,822
Get a blanket.

1752
01:10:32,796 --> 01:10:34,831
How'd I get here?

1753
01:10:34,931 --> 01:10:35,899
We came and got you, Jay.

1754
01:10:38,868 --> 01:10:40,203
How'd you find me?

1755
01:10:40,304 --> 01:10:42,872
Carlos.

1756
01:10:42,972 --> 01:10:44,173
You're sick, Jay.

1757
01:10:44,274 --> 01:10:45,208
We're gonna bring you to rehab.

1758
01:10:45,309 --> 01:10:46,643
OK?
- No.

1759
01:10:46,743 --> 01:10:47,777
I'll be all right.

1760
01:10:47,877 --> 01:10:48,678
You shouldn't--

1761
01:10:48,778 --> 01:10:49,746
JJ listen to me.

1762
01:10:49,846 --> 01:10:51,415
You were shooting in
there for two days.

1763
01:10:51,515 --> 01:10:53,417
If they hadn't found you,
you would have overdosed.

1764
01:10:53,517 --> 01:10:54,751
I'm not going nowhere.

1765
01:10:54,851 --> 01:10:55,719
I'm fine.

1766
01:10:55,819 --> 01:10:56,620
Let me go.

1767
01:10:56,720 --> 01:10:57,721
It's OK.

1768
01:10:57,821 --> 01:10:58,655
No.

1769
01:10:58,755 --> 01:10:59,356
Let me go.

1770
01:10:59,456 --> 01:11:00,290
Grab his legs.

1771
01:11:00,390 --> 01:11:01,958
Let me go.
No!

1772
01:11:02,058 --> 01:11:02,892
Let me go!

1773
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:04,728
No, Louie.
No.

1774
01:11:04,828 --> 01:11:05,729
Louie help me.

1775
01:11:05,829 --> 01:11:06,496
Mommy.

1776
01:11:06,596 --> 01:11:09,733
[inaudible] Help me Louie.

1777
01:11:09,833 --> 01:11:10,734
No!

1778
01:11:10,834 --> 01:11:12,902
No!

1779
01:11:13,002 --> 01:11:13,837
No.

1780
01:11:13,937 --> 01:11:16,139
No.

1781
01:11:16,239 --> 01:11:18,207
I'm so scared.

1782
01:11:18,308 --> 01:11:19,142
I'm so scared.

1783
01:11:19,242 --> 01:11:20,109
[crying]

1784
01:11:20,209 --> 01:11:21,110
It'll be all right.

1785
01:11:21,210 --> 01:11:22,679
It'll be all right.

1786
01:11:25,549 --> 01:11:27,384
I'm sorry I took the money.

1787
01:11:27,484 --> 01:11:32,088
I'm so sorry I took the money.

1788
01:11:32,188 --> 01:11:34,858
I still owe Pauley 500.

1789
01:11:34,958 --> 01:11:36,693
Bubbles won the pool game.

1790
01:11:36,793 --> 01:11:39,095
Don't worry.

1791
01:11:39,195 --> 01:11:43,132
[hopeful music]

1792
01:11:43,232 --> 01:11:44,033
Hey, hey, hey.

1793
01:11:58,848 --> 01:12:01,250
JJ (VOICEOVER): Spent
the fall of '96 in rehab.

1794
01:12:01,351 --> 01:12:02,652
Upstate New York.

1795
01:12:02,752 --> 01:12:04,354
I wasn't allowed any visitors.

1796
01:12:04,454 --> 01:12:05,655
I felt like a criminal.

1797
01:12:05,755 --> 01:12:08,324
It was the loneliest
three months of my life.

1798
01:12:08,425 --> 01:12:11,027
Our dream of owning a
bar seemed to be drifting

1799
01:12:11,127 --> 01:12:13,296
further and further away.

1800
01:12:13,397 --> 01:12:15,198
Louie and Laura
had gotten engaged.

1801
01:12:15,298 --> 01:12:18,802
And Gina, she was now in her
seventh month of pregnancy.

1802
01:12:18,902 --> 01:12:22,005
Me coming home made
our family complete.

1803
01:12:22,105 --> 01:12:22,972
Surprise!

1804
01:12:23,072 --> 01:12:24,941
[cheering]

1805
01:12:25,041 --> 01:12:25,909
Welcome home.

1806
01:12:35,018 --> 01:12:35,819
It's OK.

1807
01:12:35,919 --> 01:12:37,353
It's OK.

1808
01:12:37,454 --> 01:12:38,321
I love you mom.

1809
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:39,222
I love you too.

1810
01:12:39,322 --> 01:12:40,724
I missed you.

1811
01:12:40,824 --> 01:12:42,125
I missed you.

1812
01:12:42,225 --> 01:12:43,192
You look good.

1813
01:12:43,292 --> 01:12:44,127
Thank you.

1814
01:12:44,227 --> 01:12:45,028
Hey.

1815
01:12:45,128 --> 01:12:46,930
Hey brother.

1816
01:12:47,030 --> 01:12:47,997
- Look who's here.
- Louie.

1817
01:12:48,097 --> 01:12:48,898
Jay.

1818
01:12:51,401 --> 01:12:53,069
You look good.
- Thank you.

1819
01:12:53,169 --> 01:12:54,203
Thank you.

1820
01:12:54,303 --> 01:12:55,238
Hey, uh, Lisette
gave me the news.

1821
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:56,640
Congratulations you guys.

1822
01:12:56,740 --> 01:12:57,340
Thanks.

1823
01:12:57,441 --> 01:12:58,608
What're you drinking?

1824
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,109
- You buying?
- I always buy.

1825
01:13:00,209 --> 01:13:01,044
Come on.

1826
01:13:01,144 --> 01:13:03,346
What do you want?

1827
01:13:03,447 --> 01:13:05,081
I'll have a cranberry juice.

1828
01:13:05,181 --> 01:13:06,249
All right.

1829
01:13:06,349 --> 01:13:08,217
Xavier, three
cranberries, please.

1830
01:13:08,317 --> 01:13:09,753
JJ, welcome home.

1831
01:13:09,853 --> 01:13:11,755
- Thanks, Stevie.
- Drinks are on the house.

1832
01:13:11,855 --> 01:13:12,522
Salute.

1833
01:13:12,622 --> 01:13:13,590
(TOGETHER) Salute, boys.

1834
01:13:16,926 --> 01:13:17,661
Hey.

1835
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:19,863
Got a little something for ya.

1836
01:13:19,963 --> 01:13:20,730
Aw.

1837
01:13:20,830 --> 01:13:21,898
What'd you guys get me?
- Huh?

1838
01:13:21,998 --> 01:13:22,832
Oh, man.

1839
01:13:22,932 --> 01:13:23,800
You think?

1840
01:13:26,603 --> 01:13:27,871
A Yankee hat.
All right.

1841
01:13:27,971 --> 01:13:29,739
Thanks, brother.
- They won the series.

1842
01:13:29,839 --> 01:13:31,340
You don't have to
tell me, brother.

1843
01:13:31,441 --> 01:13:32,809
That's all I did was
follow them up there.

1844
01:13:32,909 --> 01:13:34,678
I was getting so bored, I
started watching the Mets.

1845
01:13:34,778 --> 01:13:35,411
The Mets?

1846
01:13:35,512 --> 01:13:36,946
You did have it rough.

1847
01:13:37,046 --> 01:13:37,881
Hey.

1848
01:13:37,981 --> 01:13:39,282
You know something?

1849
01:13:39,382 --> 01:13:41,718
I want to thank you
guys for everything.

1850
01:13:41,818 --> 01:13:43,286
You guys are like my brothers.

1851
01:13:43,386 --> 01:13:46,055
And, uh-- And I love you.

1852
01:13:46,155 --> 01:13:47,290
And it's good to be home.

1853
01:13:47,390 --> 01:13:48,291
Hey.

1854
01:13:48,391 --> 01:13:49,593
It's good to have you home.

1855
01:13:54,430 --> 01:13:55,599
Now, if you guys
will excuse me,

1856
01:13:55,699 --> 01:13:57,801
I have to go dance
with my favorite lady.

1857
01:14:02,171 --> 01:14:03,439
Xavier.

1858
01:14:03,540 --> 01:14:05,775
Put some vodka in here.

1859
01:14:05,875 --> 01:14:22,325
[romantic music]

1860
01:14:22,425 --> 01:14:24,661
Baby, let's dance.

1861
01:14:24,761 --> 01:14:26,930
Baby, I got a headache.

1862
01:14:27,030 --> 01:14:28,264
Did you eat?

1863
01:14:28,364 --> 01:14:29,599
Yeah.

1864
01:14:29,699 --> 01:14:31,367
Tomorrow you're going
to go see Dr. Derico.

1865
01:14:31,467 --> 01:14:32,936
You probably have allergies.

1866
01:14:33,036 --> 01:14:34,904
Something like that.

1867
01:14:35,004 --> 01:14:36,172
Yes, dear.

1868
01:14:36,272 --> 01:14:37,106
Come here.

1869
01:14:43,379 --> 01:14:44,848
Giuseppe.

1870
01:14:44,948 --> 01:14:46,482
How are ya?
- How you doing?

1871
01:14:46,583 --> 01:14:47,551
How's the family?

1872
01:14:47,651 --> 01:14:49,385
Good. everybody's great.

1873
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,054
I hear you're
going to be a father.

1874
01:14:51,154 --> 01:14:52,856
Couple more months.

1875
01:14:52,956 --> 01:14:53,790
Jesus.

1876
01:14:53,890 --> 01:14:54,824
Time flies.

1877
01:14:54,924 --> 01:14:56,860
I remember the
day you were born.

1878
01:14:56,960 --> 01:14:59,428
You were in such a rush
to get out see the world.

1879
01:14:59,529 --> 01:15:02,799
You jumped right
out into my hands.

1880
01:15:02,899 --> 01:15:05,702
Well, let's see what's
going on here now.

1881
01:15:08,471 --> 01:15:11,975
Bad, uh, headaches, dizziness.

1882
01:15:12,075 --> 01:15:14,410
How long has this been going on?
- Little while.

1883
01:15:14,510 --> 01:15:16,813
Did you change your diet?

1884
01:15:16,913 --> 01:15:19,716
I eat what I
always eat, macaroni.

1885
01:15:19,816 --> 01:15:24,287
Well, uh-- Let's take a look.

1886
01:15:24,387 --> 01:15:25,755
And we'll see what's going on.

1887
01:15:30,660 --> 01:15:31,928
What do you see?

1888
01:15:32,028 --> 01:15:32,829
Nothing.

1889
01:15:32,929 --> 01:15:36,733
[laughs] OK.

1890
01:15:36,833 --> 01:15:39,068
Now, i want to
check your reflexes.

1891
01:15:39,168 --> 01:15:40,737
So, relax your leg.

1892
01:15:44,874 --> 01:15:46,509
You're the luckiest
motherfucker in basketball.

1893
01:15:46,610 --> 01:15:48,477
Luck?
That's skill, buddy.

1894
01:15:48,578 --> 01:15:49,779
Watch this.
You ready?

1895
01:15:49,879 --> 01:15:50,947
Let's go, bring it on.

1896
01:15:51,047 --> 01:15:51,848
All right.

1897
01:15:54,317 --> 01:15:55,184
I need a rest, man.

1898
01:15:55,284 --> 01:15:56,519
Rest?

1899
01:15:56,620 --> 01:15:57,687
Man, I was dominating
you under them boards.

1900
01:16:01,057 --> 01:16:02,626
Hey, you know what
I think, Louie?

1901
01:16:02,726 --> 01:16:04,127
I don't think there's
anything wrong with you, man.

1902
01:16:04,227 --> 01:16:07,997
I just think you're
addicted to that shit.

1903
01:16:08,097 --> 01:16:10,299
It's good to
have you home, JJ.

1904
01:16:10,399 --> 01:16:11,567
It's good to be home, Louie.

1905
01:16:20,143 --> 01:16:21,110
Am I gonna live?

1906
01:16:21,210 --> 01:16:22,679
Oh, you're fine.

1907
01:16:22,779 --> 01:16:24,981
Your blood pressure
is a little high.

1908
01:16:25,081 --> 01:16:26,616
And as far as the
headaches, that

1909
01:16:26,716 --> 01:16:30,253
could be caused by many
things, stress, overwork.

1910
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:32,288
I'd like you to see a
specialist friend of mine

1911
01:16:32,388 --> 01:16:33,890
at New York University.

1912
01:16:33,990 --> 01:16:37,360
Hell do some tests, run a CAT
scan, check you out real good.

1913
01:16:37,460 --> 01:16:39,028
It's probably nothing.

1914
01:16:39,128 --> 01:16:40,263
You're the boss.

1915
01:16:40,363 --> 01:16:41,230
Good.

1916
01:16:41,330 --> 01:16:42,398
Here's his name and phone.

1917
01:16:42,498 --> 01:16:43,933
Now, make an
appointment tomorrow,

1918
01:16:44,033 --> 01:16:46,535
and we should have some
answers by the end of the week.

1919
01:16:46,636 --> 01:16:48,271
All right.

1920
01:16:48,371 --> 01:16:49,172
Thanks, doc.

1921
01:16:49,272 --> 01:16:50,539
OK.

1922
01:16:50,640 --> 01:16:51,975
And give my love to Gina.

1923
01:16:52,075 --> 01:16:52,876
You got it.

1924
01:17:01,117 --> 01:17:02,351
[doorbell ringing]

1925
01:17:03,820 --> 01:17:05,188
Dr. Derrico, hi.

1926
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:06,322
Come in.

1927
01:17:06,422 --> 01:17:07,256
Thank you.

1928
01:17:11,494 --> 01:17:13,329
Is, uh, Joey home?

1929
01:17:13,429 --> 01:17:14,497
Yeah, he's inside.

1930
01:17:14,597 --> 01:17:15,564
Joseph.

1931
01:17:15,665 --> 01:17:18,567
Dr. Derrico's here.

1932
01:17:18,668 --> 01:17:19,502
Thank you.

1933
01:17:19,602 --> 01:17:20,403
Hey, doc.

1934
01:17:20,503 --> 01:17:21,570
Twice in one week?

1935
01:17:21,671 --> 01:17:23,406
I ain't paying for this one.

1936
01:17:23,506 --> 01:17:24,674
Hi, Joey.

1937
01:17:24,774 --> 01:17:26,776
You want a beer,
soda or anything?

1938
01:17:26,876 --> 01:17:28,377
No, no, I'm fine.

1939
01:17:28,477 --> 01:17:29,312
Sit down.

1940
01:17:39,422 --> 01:17:41,024
So what's up, doc?

1941
01:17:44,560 --> 01:17:48,998
Your-- your test
results came back.

1942
01:17:49,098 --> 01:17:49,933
Yeah?

1943
01:17:53,269 --> 01:17:54,103
It's not good.

1944
01:17:56,806 --> 01:17:59,608
You have a brain tumor, Joey.

1945
01:17:59,709 --> 01:18:04,480
They call it a
cerebral astrocytoma.

1946
01:18:04,580 --> 01:18:06,716
It's on your brain stem.

1947
01:18:06,816 --> 01:18:09,418
What does that mean?

1948
01:18:09,518 --> 01:18:10,920
It's inoperable.

1949
01:18:13,289 --> 01:18:14,891
Well, they have to be
able to do something.

1950
01:18:14,991 --> 01:18:18,094
Can't they give him
drugs or radiation?

1951
01:18:18,194 --> 01:18:21,197
They've had very little
success treating this type

1952
01:18:21,297 --> 01:18:22,331
of tumor at this stage.

1953
01:18:25,134 --> 01:18:26,836
I'm sorry.

1954
01:18:26,936 --> 01:18:30,339
I wrote a prescription
for your pain.

1955
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:36,512
You may experience drowsiness,
seizures, possible paralysis.

1956
01:18:36,612 --> 01:18:39,315
Everybody's different.

1957
01:18:39,415 --> 01:18:41,918
How long?

1958
01:18:42,018 --> 01:18:44,520
Two to six months.

1959
01:18:44,620 --> 01:18:47,723
You never know
with these things.

1960
01:18:47,824 --> 01:18:50,326
You're young, you're strong.

1961
01:18:50,426 --> 01:18:51,694
We gotta go.

1962
01:18:51,795 --> 01:18:53,362
Go where?

1963
01:18:53,462 --> 01:18:56,165
We gotta tell my mom and dad.

1964
01:18:56,265 --> 01:18:59,769
[music playing]

1965
01:20:03,967 --> 01:20:05,368
Hey, Joey.

1966
01:20:05,468 --> 01:20:06,435
We'll catch a flick.

1967
01:20:06,535 --> 01:20:07,370
You wanna go?

1968
01:20:09,873 --> 01:20:12,341
Hey, what's wrong?

1969
01:20:12,441 --> 01:20:15,744
Need to talk to you guys.

1970
01:20:15,845 --> 01:20:19,515
I got what they call a
cerebral astrocytoma.

1971
01:20:19,615 --> 01:20:21,885
The fuck is that?

1972
01:20:21,985 --> 01:20:24,420
It's a brain tumor, JJ.

1973
01:20:24,520 --> 01:20:27,623
They say it's pretty bad.

1974
01:20:27,723 --> 01:20:29,893
There's something I need to do.

1975
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:31,895

So what do we do?

We give him five
minutes, we take the train.

01:28:08,351 --> 01:28:10,653
Hold it.

scared the shit out of us!

Where's your car?

2150
01:28:17,292 --> 01:28:19,495
They towed it on me.

2151
01:28:19,595 --> 01:28:20,996
My registration was up.

2152
01:28:21,096 --> 01:28:22,965
I even told the cop that my
Uncle Pete was in the job.

2153
01:28:23,065 --> 01:28:24,733
Nothing.

I'll be there for you.

2334
01:37:57,139 --> 01:38:02,410
I lit a lot of candles,
said a lot of prayers.

2335
01:38:02,510 --> 01:38:06,982
Called up the hospital,
let you know that I care.

2336
01:38:07,082 --> 01:38:09,751
Well, they say you
done flipped out,

2337
01:38:09,851 --> 01:38:12,320
drove your car into the lake.

2338
01:38:12,420 --> 01:38:17,059
Shouted obscenities and
the Lord's name in vain.

2339
01:38:17,159 --> 01:38:20,028
So take your time, friend.

2340
01:38:20,128 --> 01:38:22,030
You'll be all right.

2341
01:38:22,130 --> 01:38:30,005
When you're all done healing,
we'll go out every night.

2342
01:38:30,105 --> 01:38:34,977
'Cause your my friend,
my friend for life.

2343
01:38:35,077 --> 01:38:39,914
Let 'em say we're crazy,
two youths in the night.

2344
01:38:40,015 --> 01:38:44,886
You're my friend,
my friend for life.

2345
01:38:44,987 --> 01:38:49,257
Partners in crime,
we live a crazy life.

2346
01:38:49,357 --> 01:38:54,429
But you're my friend,
my friend for life.

2347
01:38:54,529 --> 01:38:56,831
And I miss you.

2348
01:38:56,931 --> 01:39:00,402
And I hope you'll be all right.

2349
01:39:07,275 --> 01:39:11,546
High in the mountains,
traveling through the clouds.

2350
01:39:11,646 --> 01:39:16,118
We'd stare at a
brand-new world we found.

2351
01:39:16,218 --> 01:39:21,489
We'd reminisce the old town,
knock it to the ground.

2352
01:39:21,589 --> 01:39:26,294
Barroom fights and
wild Friday nights.

2353
01:39:26,394 --> 01:39:32,034
Rock and roll music till
the morning light was all we

2354
01:39:32,134 --> 01:39:35,537
needed to stay happy with life.

2355
01:39:35,637 --> 01:39:40,142
And now you're gone,
and it hurts me inside.

2356
01:39:40,242 --> 01:39:45,213
I guess all that drugging
made you lose your mind.

2357
01:39:45,313 --> 01:39:47,749
Well, how can I sleep when--

2358
01:39:47,849 --> 01:39:50,985
when you're on my mind?

2359
01:39:51,086 --> 01:39:53,721
I need a miracle this time.

2360
01:39:53,821 --> 01:39:57,459
I need a miracle this time.

2361
01:39:57,559 --> 01:40:02,064
You're my friend,
my friend for life.

2362
01:40:02,164 --> 01:40:06,901
Let 'em say we're crazy,
two youths in the night.

2363
01:40:07,001 --> 01:40:08,970
You're my friend.

2364
01:40:09,071 --> 01:40:11,306
My friend for life.

2365
01:40:11,406 --> 01:40:15,910
Did a lot of crazy things
on a dare in the night.

2366
01:40:16,010 --> 01:40:20,982
And you're my friend,
my friend for life.

2367
01:40:21,083 --> 01:40:23,751
Partners in crime.

2368
01:40:23,851 --> 01:40:26,020
We live a crazy life.

2369
01:40:29,624 --> 01:40:31,826
Well, you're my friend.

2370
01:40:31,926 --> 01:40:33,895
My friend.

2371
01:40:33,995 --> 01:40:36,464
Yeah, you're my friend.

2372
01:40:36,564 --> 01:40:40,168
Doesn't matter who's
right or wrong.

2373
01:40:40,268 --> 01:40:43,405
You're my friend.

2374
01:40:43,505 --> 01:40:47,742
Let 'em say, let 'em
say that we're crazy.

2375
01:41:02,190 --> 01:41:03,191
Doesn't matter.

2376
01:41:05,860 --> 01:41:07,595
No, no, doesn't matter.

2377
01:41:10,265 --> 01:41:17,772
No, no, doesn't matter
who's right or wrong.

2378
01:41:17,872 --> 01:41:18,940
Let me tell you.

2379
01:41:19,040 --> 01:41:20,074
Let me tell you.

2380
01:41:20,175 --> 01:41:21,676
You're my friend.

2381
01:41:21,776 --> 01:41:25,180
