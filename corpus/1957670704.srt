1
00:00:01,569 --> 00:00:06,574
- (soft violins)

2
00:00:12,946 --> 00:00:17,951
(R&B music)

3
00:00:53,287 --> 00:00:54,188
- (mumbles)

4
00:00:54,222 --> 00:00:55,823
- Yeah, it is, like everytime,

5
00:00:55,856 --> 00:00:58,859
I mean everything I do, she just

6
00:00:58,892 --> 00:01:01,429
- I understand, I
understand Glenn, I do.

7
00:01:01,462 --> 00:01:04,698
You know, it's just funny
that, how life is sometimes.

8
00:01:04,732 --> 00:01:07,835
You know, sometimes
relationships just
don't work out

9
00:01:07,868 --> 00:01:10,104
the way we want
them to work out.

10
00:01:10,138 --> 00:01:14,108
You know, but, you know, I
just hate to see you like this.

11
00:01:14,142 --> 00:01:15,876
I mean, come on, Glenn.

12
00:01:15,909 --> 00:01:17,111
You've got to be strong

13
00:01:17,145 --> 00:01:18,279
and you've got to
get out of this.

14
00:01:18,312 --> 00:01:19,880
You've got to snap out of it.

15
00:01:19,913 --> 00:01:22,283
I don't want you being
depressed like this.

16
00:01:22,316 --> 00:01:24,218
There are too many
women out there.

17
00:01:24,252 --> 00:01:25,619
There are too many

18
00:01:25,653 --> 00:01:26,820
and you are a good man

19
00:01:26,854 --> 00:01:28,122
and believe me, you
can get a woman,

20
00:01:28,156 --> 00:01:30,291
any woman you want.

21
00:01:30,324 --> 00:01:31,492
You're a successful doctor.

22
00:01:31,525 --> 00:01:32,726
You have so much going on.

23
00:01:32,760 --> 00:01:35,229
and if she can't
see that, fuck her.

24
00:01:35,263 --> 00:01:40,268
(hip-hop music)

25
00:01:56,950 --> 00:01:58,519
- [Glenn] A lot of people
don't understand how

26
00:01:58,552 --> 00:02:02,490
a friendly game of dominoes can
lead into some serious shit.

27
00:02:02,523 --> 00:02:04,558
Now, I was getting over
a breakup with my girl,

28
00:02:04,592 --> 00:02:06,427
getting together
with a few friends.

29
00:02:06,460 --> 00:02:08,862
At least I thought
they were my friends.

30
00:02:08,896 --> 00:02:11,632
Who would know that a good
time would turn into this.

31
00:02:13,066 --> 00:02:15,603
Normally, there are three
sides to every story,

32
00:02:16,737 --> 00:02:19,973
my side, her side,
and the truth.

33
00:02:20,874 --> 00:02:23,311
In this case, there were five,

34
00:02:24,478 --> 00:02:27,080
four guys, plus the truth.

35
00:02:28,882 --> 00:02:29,883
(laughing)

36
00:02:29,917 --> 00:02:31,219
- [Man] Fuck you man.

37
00:02:32,386 --> 00:02:34,288
- All this time,
we waiting on you.

38
00:02:34,322 --> 00:02:36,123
- Brother, you ain't
gotta wait for nobody.

39
00:02:36,156 --> 00:02:37,291
Yeah, you wait 'cuz you want to.

40
00:02:37,325 --> 00:02:38,692
You start when you want to.

41
00:02:38,726 --> 00:02:40,060
Nobody asked you to wait.

42
00:02:40,093 --> 00:02:41,595
- We ain't drinking beer.

43
00:02:41,629 --> 00:02:44,365
- Hell, man I come when
I'm ready, same as usual.

44
00:02:44,398 --> 00:02:47,468
- [Glenn] Wesley, like the
dearest of people everywhere

45
00:02:47,501 --> 00:02:50,304
was one who we
least appreciated.

46
00:02:51,739 --> 00:02:54,408
If there's anybody you ever
wanted to have your back,

47
00:02:54,442 --> 00:02:56,444
it's Wesley.

48
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:58,145
But sometimes, he's
got your back so hard,

49
00:02:58,178 --> 00:03:00,948
you feel like you're
carrying a brother.

50
00:03:00,981 --> 00:03:04,285
And now, this new thing he's
going through with women,

51
00:03:04,318 --> 00:03:05,653
man, I don't know.

52
00:03:05,686 --> 00:03:07,921
You tell me.

53
00:03:07,955 --> 00:03:10,324
- That's why you give
me a while girl anytime.

54
00:03:10,358 --> 00:03:11,825
- What?
- Yep, that's what I said.

55
00:03:11,859 --> 00:03:13,294
- You know why?

56
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,162
Because they don't care
nothing what you have to say.

57
00:03:15,195 --> 00:03:17,331
Now, I'm talking to this
white girl the other day

58
00:03:17,365 --> 00:03:19,667
and I told her, you
know what I said?

59
00:03:19,700 --> 00:03:23,337
I said, "See you later, because
I'm going to get me some

60
00:03:23,371 --> 00:03:26,674
"fellatio on the patio
and what time I be back,

61
00:03:26,707 --> 00:03:27,775
"you better not ask."
(laughing)

62
00:03:27,808 --> 00:03:28,942
(laughing)

63
00:03:28,976 --> 00:03:30,444
- Lying motherfucker.

64
00:03:30,478 --> 00:03:33,681
- He can't even, he can't
even spell fellatio.

65
00:03:33,714 --> 00:03:36,317
(laughing)

66
00:03:37,685 --> 00:03:39,820
- [Voiceover] Me and this
brother had this girl one time.

67
00:03:41,355 --> 00:03:43,624
Naw, that's another story.

68
00:03:45,726 --> 00:03:48,862
You see, his whole
trip is respect.

69
00:03:48,896 --> 00:03:51,965
He don't give it
and he ain't got it.

70
00:03:51,999 --> 00:03:54,034
Now, at one time or another,

71
00:03:54,067 --> 00:03:56,470
something must have cost him

72
00:03:56,504 --> 00:04:00,207
'cuz now he's out to
make everybody pay.

73
00:04:00,240 --> 00:04:01,609
- I'm telling you, man,

74
00:04:01,642 --> 00:04:04,011
tramps, every one of 'em, man.

75
00:04:04,044 --> 00:04:06,847
Women ain't shit,
from, from Carla to

76
00:04:06,880 --> 00:04:09,717
Wanda to Sheila,
all the same man.

77
00:04:09,750 --> 00:04:10,984
- [Samuel] Shit, you
can name all day.

78
00:04:11,018 --> 00:04:12,653
- [Chris] Every one
of 'em's some tramps.

79
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:13,721
- Chris, man.

80
00:04:13,754 --> 00:04:14,888
- Nah, no exceptions, man.

81
00:04:14,922 --> 00:04:16,223
- Man, wait, now hold on.

82
00:04:16,256 --> 00:04:18,158
- Bullshit, you
pussy-whipped motherfucker.

83
00:04:19,327 --> 00:04:20,894
Every one of them
hoes is some tramps.

84
00:04:20,928 --> 00:04:22,396
Now, you look around the
table and you tell us

85
00:04:22,430 --> 00:04:24,031
which one of us
haven't been turned out

86
00:04:24,064 --> 00:04:27,000
by some low-life,
open-your-leg-tramp hoe

87
00:04:27,034 --> 00:04:28,869
to anybody that come around.

88
00:04:28,902 --> 00:04:31,004
Name one of use who haven't.

89
00:04:31,038 --> 00:04:33,574
- [Voiceover] Samuel,
I met through Chris.

90
00:04:33,607 --> 00:04:36,043
Now, they were
friends before us.

91
00:04:36,076 --> 00:04:37,578
I liked his loyalty,

92
00:04:37,611 --> 00:04:41,248
which regardless of sides
went always with his friend,

93
00:04:41,281 --> 00:04:43,116
he's on everybody's side.

94
00:04:45,953 --> 00:04:48,155
Anybody else got a problem?

95
00:04:48,188 --> 00:04:50,257
He's the man with the plan,

96
00:04:50,290 --> 00:04:53,727
(chuckles) as if he can
keep his own shit straight.

97
00:04:53,761 --> 00:04:56,530
I mean, he can pretend
with everybody else,

98
00:04:56,564 --> 00:04:58,366
but we know what's
really going on, right?

99
00:04:59,367 --> 00:05:01,769
Ol' Captain Save-A-Hoe.

100
00:05:01,802 --> 00:05:03,003
- Look, I'm all over town, baby.

101
00:05:03,036 --> 00:05:04,438
You just better keep up.

102
00:05:04,472 --> 00:05:06,407
Everyday is something,
something everyday.

103
00:05:06,440 --> 00:05:07,875
Shit, what's today?

104
00:05:07,908 --> 00:05:10,210
Look, I ain't got to tell
y'all. Y'all know how it was.

105
00:05:10,243 --> 00:05:12,680
Before, I couldn't have told
you the day of the week,

106
00:05:12,713 --> 00:05:14,214
trembling just to watch TV,

107
00:05:14,247 --> 00:05:15,849
scared of a love scene,

108
00:05:15,883 --> 00:05:17,618
nevermind pop radio.

109
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:21,254
Love songs was torture,
but you know what?

110
00:05:21,288 --> 00:05:24,425
To hell with Gina or the
motherfucker that she left with.

111
00:05:24,458 --> 00:05:26,694
You know, I was thinking
of stalking Kenny G.

112
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,228
- [Chris] (chuckles)
Why? (laughing)

113
00:05:28,261 --> 00:05:31,732
- Now, it's a different
girl every day.

114
00:05:31,765 --> 00:05:34,735
Shit, my dick don't get hard
without my appointment book.

115
00:05:35,836 --> 00:05:37,805
- This is what all
y'all need to be doing.

116
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:39,573
A bunch of drunk-ass alcoholics.

117
00:05:39,607 --> 00:05:41,609
- Like you don't drink?

118
00:05:41,642 --> 00:05:44,478
- No, but I ain't trying
to keep nothing from y'all.

119
00:05:44,512 --> 00:05:46,079
If I had brought enough, man,

120
00:05:46,113 --> 00:05:48,416
all y'all would be
welcome to some'n.

121
00:05:48,449 --> 00:05:50,584
But, I didn't.

122
00:05:50,618 --> 00:05:52,486
(laughing)

123
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:53,887
- [Glenn] You gave me your word.

124
00:05:53,921 --> 00:05:55,956
- [Samuel] And you believed him.

125
00:05:55,989 --> 00:05:57,658
- Shit, that was
a long time ago.

126
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,159
- [Glenn] A long time ago--

127
00:05:59,192 --> 00:06:02,663
- I know when I broke up with
Karen, this what I told her.

128
00:06:04,031 --> 00:06:06,233
I told her that I wasn't
gonna smoke with nobody else,

129
00:06:06,266 --> 00:06:07,668
you know, because that
was supposed to be

130
00:06:07,701 --> 00:06:09,837
special between us.
- [Samuel] No.

131
00:06:09,870 --> 00:06:11,238
(laughing)

132
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:12,940
Well, I'm over at her
crib the other day

133
00:06:12,973 --> 00:06:16,510
'cuz I'm still tapping
that ass (laughs)

134
00:06:16,544 --> 00:06:19,513
and she offered me a little
bit of the herb she had

135
00:06:19,547 --> 00:06:21,314
to take with me and
I told her, you know,

136
00:06:21,348 --> 00:06:22,916
"No, I don't need it."

137
00:06:22,950 --> 00:06:26,353
I said, "I can't smoke
with nobody except you."

138
00:06:26,386 --> 00:06:28,021
Telling lies so
motherfucking good,

139
00:06:28,055 --> 00:06:30,791
you would swear it was
the truth, you know.

140
00:06:30,824 --> 00:06:32,560
- You turned down smoke?

141
00:06:34,027 --> 00:06:35,128
- It's true, though, man.

142
00:06:35,162 --> 00:06:36,697
I wasn't trying to lie.

143
00:06:36,730 --> 00:06:37,965
- [Glenn] A liar ain't
gotta try to lie.

144
00:06:37,998 --> 00:06:39,332
- Meant every word at the time.

145
00:06:39,366 --> 00:06:40,701
(laughing)

146
00:06:40,734 --> 00:06:42,936
- I am astonished at
your recovery, man.

147
00:06:42,970 --> 00:06:44,872
I mean after all of the
shit she put you through.

148
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:45,939
Man, look at you, man.

149
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:47,140
- On top of that, another man?

150
00:06:47,174 --> 00:06:48,809
- Then, he had to
move in with his mama.

151
00:06:48,842 --> 00:06:49,943
(laughing)

152
00:06:49,977 --> 00:06:52,946
- [Samuel] Damn, man.

153
00:06:52,980 --> 00:06:56,484
Damn, the treachery, man.

154
00:06:56,517 --> 00:06:59,319
- Your delayed
punctuality precludes you

155
00:06:59,352 --> 00:07:03,323
from the knowledge that
this issue is closed.

156
00:07:03,356 --> 00:07:07,495
(R&B music)

157
00:07:07,528 --> 00:07:10,230
- Wait until you see
what I got for him.

158
00:07:10,263 --> 00:07:11,965
- What you got for who?

159
00:07:11,999 --> 00:07:14,067
- This time, the fire.

160
00:07:14,101 --> 00:07:16,203
- If it's over, you
need to leave him alone.

161
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,405
- I have left him alone,

162
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,907
with a vengeance.

163
00:07:19,940 --> 00:07:21,041
- For what?

164
00:07:21,074 --> 00:07:22,743
- For everything.

165
00:07:22,776 --> 00:07:24,344
For not loving me.

166
00:07:25,913 --> 00:07:28,215
For all those years.

167
00:07:28,248 --> 00:07:29,850
- I am, however, grateful.

168
00:07:29,883 --> 00:07:31,218
(laughing)

169
00:07:31,251 --> 00:07:34,087
for the considerate
acknowledgement

170
00:07:34,121 --> 00:07:36,423
of my extraordinary recovery.

171
00:07:36,456 --> 00:07:40,060
- Will somebody get me a
tourniquet before I bleed, shit.

172
00:07:40,093 --> 00:07:45,098
(hip-hop music playing)

173
00:07:46,266 --> 00:07:49,069
Alright, damn, nigga,
it was just a joke.

174
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:50,704
Alright, I'm sorry.

175
00:07:50,738 --> 00:07:52,640
- You ain't sorry.

176
00:07:53,473 --> 00:07:55,208
- Fuck you, then. (chuckles)

177
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:57,410
- Hey, hey, hey, y'all leave
the young blood alone, man.

178
00:07:57,444 --> 00:07:59,580
He's just like that
because you gang up on him.

179
00:07:59,613 --> 00:08:01,281
Look, now can we start
this game sometime

180
00:08:01,314 --> 00:08:02,716
before I got to go?

181
00:08:03,751 --> 00:08:04,852
- Where you gotta go?

182
00:08:04,885 --> 00:08:06,086
- Hold up.

183
00:08:06,119 --> 00:08:07,287
- Hey, shit, I'll
find somewhere.

184
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:08,789
Hell, anywhere. It
ain't for you to know.

185
00:08:08,822 --> 00:08:10,257
- Alright, now.

186
00:08:10,290 --> 00:08:15,162
(dominoes rattling)

187
00:08:17,230 --> 00:08:20,067
- Alright, now we're
getting somewhere.

188
00:08:20,100 --> 00:08:25,105
(R&B music playing)

189
00:08:31,011 --> 00:08:36,016
(laughing)

190
00:08:38,586 --> 00:08:39,419
- You better beware.

191
00:08:39,452 --> 00:08:40,888
- Beware of what?

192
00:08:40,921 --> 00:08:42,455
- [Chris] Go ahead and pass,
you know you wanna pass.

193
00:08:42,489 --> 00:08:45,793
- What are you hiding and
looking to turn away from?

194
00:08:45,826 --> 00:08:48,662
- What am I? What are you?

195
00:08:48,696 --> 00:08:50,463
- Hey, fellas. Come on.

196
00:08:50,497 --> 00:08:52,966
- Play the game if
you're gonna play.

197
00:08:53,000 --> 00:08:57,671
- Months, I've been
swearing that I hated him.

198
00:08:57,705 --> 00:08:59,940
Guess what I finally got
around to telling him.

199
00:08:59,973 --> 00:09:01,341
(scoffs)

200
00:09:01,374 --> 00:09:03,677
I said I loved him.

201
00:09:03,711 --> 00:09:07,681
- (inhales and
sighs) And do you?

202
00:09:07,715 --> 00:09:08,982
- [Samuel] You want
something to worry about?

203
00:09:09,016 --> 00:09:10,450
You worry about you.

204
00:09:10,483 --> 00:09:12,853
Hell, if I could, I'd take
all of this loving I'm getting

205
00:09:12,886 --> 00:09:14,487
so you satisfied too.

206
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,023
See, so don't
reproach me for mine.

207
00:09:16,056 --> 00:09:17,691
(laughing)

208
00:09:17,725 --> 00:09:19,292
- As long as you're
happy, so am I.

209
00:09:19,326 --> 00:09:22,129
- Maybe next time after a
down stroke, I'll call you up.

210
00:09:22,162 --> 00:09:24,564
Say, "Glenn, how
was it for you?"

211
00:09:29,136 --> 00:09:30,871
- You're doing the
right thing, Samuel.

212
00:09:30,904 --> 00:09:32,940
Stand all of them hoes in a row.

213
00:09:32,973 --> 00:09:35,609
- [Samuel] That's
right. That is right.

214
00:09:35,643 --> 00:09:37,878
- Tell them, the first
one to step out of place,

215
00:09:37,911 --> 00:09:39,880
straight to the back
of the line they go.

216
00:09:39,913 --> 00:09:41,148
- Now, what you got
to say about it, huh?

217
00:09:41,181 --> 00:09:42,382
At least I've got
something I can say.

218
00:09:42,415 --> 00:09:43,717
What you got to say about it?

219
00:09:43,751 --> 00:09:44,985
- [Glenn} I think (mumbles)
- [Samuel] 15.

220
00:09:45,018 --> 00:09:45,953
- [Chris] You don't
need to smoke no weed.

221
00:09:45,986 --> 00:09:47,187
- What I got to say about what?

222
00:09:47,220 --> 00:09:49,122
- Oh, come on, pretend
like you don't know,

223
00:09:49,156 --> 00:09:52,059
as if you're not aware
that something is wrong.

224
00:09:52,092 --> 00:09:56,396
- That day when he
told me he loved me,

225
00:09:56,429 --> 00:09:58,498
it was in a way
I've never heard.

226
00:09:59,867 --> 00:10:02,102
There was a tear on every word.

227
00:10:03,436 --> 00:10:05,272
(sighing)

228
00:10:07,174 --> 00:10:11,779
His eyes had so
much hope inside.

229
00:10:13,180 --> 00:10:17,951
Black horses driving a
coach for a bride and groom,

230
00:10:21,254 --> 00:10:24,892
on the way to a long
awaited honeymoon.

231
00:10:26,860 --> 00:10:28,528
I knew those eyes.

232
00:10:28,561 --> 00:10:30,864
- Look, I have no intentions
of saying anything,

233
00:10:30,898 --> 00:10:33,566
but if you insist on hearing
what it is you think I think,

234
00:10:33,600 --> 00:10:35,435
if you knew what I was
thinking, then I wouldn't

235
00:10:35,468 --> 00:10:38,338
have to open my mouth
to tell you to shut up.

236
00:10:38,371 --> 00:10:40,173
- So, how is your daughter?

237
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:42,342
- That's right, Samuel.

238
00:10:42,375 --> 00:10:43,677
Make sure you get yours.

239
00:10:43,711 --> 00:10:45,112
(laughing)

240
00:10:45,145 --> 00:10:46,980
- Now, you don't think
she's doing the same thing?

241
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:49,049
- Look, look, listen, man,

242
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,018
If they get back together, fine.

243
00:10:51,051 --> 00:10:52,920
You know, he didn't ask
for none of this shit.

244
00:10:52,953 --> 00:10:54,688
He might as well make the
best of the situation.

245
00:10:54,722 --> 00:10:55,622
- [Wesley] So, how
is your little girl?

246
00:10:55,655 --> 00:10:57,925
- She's doing fine, man. Thanks.

247
00:10:57,958 --> 00:10:59,927
She lifts my spirits.

248
00:11:00,828 --> 00:11:02,595
You know what she said to me?

249
00:11:02,629 --> 00:11:06,433
She said, "Daddy, I told
you to marry Mommy."

250
00:11:07,400 --> 00:11:08,702
- Well, you did ask her, right?

251
00:11:08,736 --> 00:11:11,104
- She said I was too late.

252
00:11:11,138 --> 00:11:14,207
- Wait a minute,
you waited 14 years.

253
00:11:14,241 --> 00:11:16,143
How long you expect
a bitch to wait?

254
00:11:16,176 --> 00:11:17,945
- Are we gonna talk about this?

255
00:11:17,978 --> 00:11:19,312
Because what did I say?

256
00:11:19,346 --> 00:11:21,281
- Well, when you love somebody
what's the difference?

257
00:11:21,314 --> 00:11:22,415
- What's the difference?

258
00:11:22,449 --> 00:11:23,751
To a woman, a lot.

259
00:11:23,784 --> 00:11:25,118
Hell, a lot to a woman.

260
00:11:25,152 --> 00:11:26,453
- Look, I didn't understand.

261
00:11:26,486 --> 00:11:28,621
I mean, the way I felt,
we had a perfect life.

262
00:11:28,655 --> 00:11:30,323
- Yeah, you might
have thought so,

263
00:11:30,357 --> 00:11:31,992
but what did she?

264
00:11:32,025 --> 00:11:33,493
- She never complained.

265
00:11:33,526 --> 00:11:36,997
I mean, I didn't know
how important it was.

266
00:11:38,031 --> 00:11:39,299
- [Wesley] Y'all can count them.

267
00:11:39,332 --> 00:11:40,333
- Yeah, well, what
did she have to say?

268
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,835
- (chuckles) Say?

269
00:11:41,869 --> 00:11:44,571
She tossed him far out the
door, is what she said.

270
00:11:44,604 --> 00:11:47,975
- She does love me as
much as ever. I know it.

271
00:11:48,008 --> 00:11:51,244
- Shit, that's
straight up bullshit.

272
00:11:51,278 --> 00:11:52,479
- Motherfucker, damn.

273
00:11:52,512 --> 00:11:54,681
- I just don't want
this boy to get hurt.

274
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:57,084
- I'm going to be fine, man.

275
00:11:57,117 --> 00:12:00,320
I'm embraced by a wonder
of my love for her

276
00:12:00,353 --> 00:12:04,191
and the understanding of
its importance in my life.

277
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:05,793
- Yeah, well, she
loves you, you think?

278
00:12:05,826 --> 00:12:07,294
- Hey, with all of
her heart and soul.

279
00:12:07,327 --> 00:12:08,495
That's what I do.

280
00:12:08,528 --> 00:12:09,696
- Alright, well,
she's gonna be back.

281
00:12:09,729 --> 00:12:10,864
- [Samuel] Please.
- [Wesley] Trust me.

282
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:13,000
(laughing)

283
00:12:13,033 --> 00:12:14,167
- Listen to you, man.

284
00:12:14,201 --> 00:12:16,536
Fools, all of y'all.

285
00:12:16,569 --> 00:12:18,538
- [Wesley] Your mama's
a female impersonator.

286
00:12:18,571 --> 00:12:20,440
- She ain't going nowhere.

287
00:12:20,473 --> 00:12:23,977
You the only one when she
kicked your ass out good.

288
00:12:24,011 --> 00:12:25,312
- [Glenn] Samuel, ease up.

289
00:12:25,345 --> 00:12:27,380
- It's the same
as any woman, man.

290
00:12:27,414 --> 00:12:30,717
I mean, she got game on you.

291
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,719
She's playing you for a sucker

292
00:12:32,752 --> 00:12:35,022
'cuz she's got
all the power now.

293
00:12:35,055 --> 00:12:37,190
Standing on your fucking
neck with all of her

294
00:12:37,224 --> 00:12:38,859
weight pressed down.

295
00:12:38,892 --> 00:12:41,694
- And if she back
up for a minute it's
just to gather speed.

296
00:12:41,728 --> 00:12:43,130
(laughing)

297
00:12:43,163 --> 00:12:47,067
- Even when you not
around, she is playing you,

298
00:12:47,100 --> 00:12:48,902
and it's getting worse, man.

299
00:12:48,936 --> 00:12:50,537
So, you remember I said that.

300
00:12:50,570 --> 00:12:52,005
- She knows all your buttons

301
00:12:52,039 --> 00:12:55,342
and the combination to
kick your ass besides.

302
00:12:55,375 --> 00:12:56,576
- [Glenn] Y'all need to quit.

303
00:12:56,609 --> 00:12:58,645
- You got you a beat
down coming, baby.

304
00:12:58,678 --> 00:13:01,214
- A beat down, that's
exactly what you got.

305
00:13:01,248 --> 00:13:03,183
- Thinking you're getting
ready for a reunion.

306
00:13:03,216 --> 00:13:05,652
Nigga, you better
get ready to cry.

307
00:13:05,685 --> 00:13:08,655
- Worse thing you could
imagine, don't be surprised.

308
00:13:08,688 --> 00:13:10,924
- She took from me my family.

309
00:13:10,958 --> 00:13:13,093
Doesn't matter
whatever happens else.

310
00:13:13,126 --> 00:13:15,662
- You can believe that
lie if you want to.

311
00:13:15,695 --> 00:13:18,231
That still don't
make that shit true.

312
00:13:18,265 --> 00:13:19,766
Because, see, what
you're dealing with here,

313
00:13:19,799 --> 00:13:23,236
is a rebel bitch on
the attack (laughing).

314
00:13:23,270 --> 00:13:25,172
- She ain't gonna be through
with this motherfucker

315
00:13:25,205 --> 00:13:26,940
until he bleeding out his eyes

316
00:13:26,974 --> 00:13:28,976
and the last drop dries.

317
00:13:31,078 --> 00:13:35,448
- Punishing him
gradually and by degrees.

318
00:13:35,482 --> 00:13:38,285
- Anybody needs to get
realistic it's you, not me.

319
00:13:38,318 --> 00:13:40,787
I'm not the one running around
chasing a thousands girls,

320
00:13:40,820 --> 00:13:43,456
every single one, all that
look like the last kind

321
00:13:43,490 --> 00:13:45,792
claiming some kind of
victory in disguise.

322
00:13:45,825 --> 00:13:47,594
- Yeah, well, better than you.

323
00:13:47,627 --> 00:13:49,196
- It's all a power trip, man.

324
00:13:49,229 --> 00:13:50,430
It ain't if it's nothing else.

325
00:13:50,463 --> 00:13:51,865
- [Samuel] Ain't if
it's nothing else?

326
00:13:51,899 --> 00:13:52,966
- I mean, you ask anybody
that got some sense

327
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,567
and they will tell you.

328
00:13:54,601 --> 00:13:57,237
Otherwise, everybody in
the world would know.

329
00:13:57,270 --> 00:13:59,973
Man, she is playing
with your mind.

330
00:14:00,007 --> 00:14:01,308
Not enough that you can see it,

331
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,676
just enough to blind you.

332
00:14:05,112 --> 00:14:07,280
It's nothing in these words
that she's coming at you with,

333
00:14:07,314 --> 00:14:10,283
it's in the intentions
that's behind it.

334
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:13,921
She's got a vice and
she's just fastening it,

335
00:14:13,954 --> 00:14:15,722
tighter.

336
00:14:15,755 --> 00:14:19,459
Calculated tenderness,
just for the effect of it.

337
00:14:20,627 --> 00:14:23,163
Got a minefield of
revelations for him

338
00:14:23,196 --> 00:14:26,433
time-released so that
the agony is more spread.

339
00:14:29,102 --> 00:14:32,439
You going to die for a long
time before you really do.

340
00:14:33,506 --> 00:14:34,807
- [Voiceover] Listen to this,

341
00:14:34,841 --> 00:14:37,810
I'm trying to
concentrate on this game.

342
00:14:37,844 --> 00:14:39,279
With relentless
fools like these,

343
00:14:39,312 --> 00:14:41,381
you learn to chill
your feelings quick.

344
00:14:43,984 --> 00:14:45,318
Not a day goes by
I don't think about

345
00:14:45,352 --> 00:14:47,287
that wedding and all
of the pain it caused.

346
00:14:47,320 --> 00:14:52,225
(R&B music)

347
00:14:59,967 --> 00:15:00,767
- [Man] Everybody, everybody.

348
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:01,935
Your attention, please.

349
00:15:01,969 --> 00:15:03,370
It's time for the old custom,

350
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,372
the throwing of the garter belt.

351
00:15:05,405 --> 00:15:07,040
- Come on Chris, get our
motherfucking ass up, man.

352
00:15:07,074 --> 00:15:08,375
You ain't got to catch
the damned thing.

353
00:15:08,408 --> 00:15:09,742
Just get in line.

354
00:15:11,678 --> 00:15:13,546
- Honey, it don't look
like they want to catch it.

355
00:15:13,580 --> 00:15:15,548
- Look, can we go?
What we waiting for?

356
00:15:15,582 --> 00:15:17,017
- Now, where's Glenn?

357
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:18,952
- He's probably getting
his hair weaved.

358
00:15:18,986 --> 00:15:21,688
- [Glenn] Look, if I
was eligible I'd be
standing over here.

359
00:15:24,992 --> 00:15:27,294
Say something else
about my hair.

360
00:15:27,327 --> 00:15:29,062
- [Samuel] You better
grab that shit.

361
00:15:29,096 --> 00:15:31,564
Unlucky motherfucker
like yourself.

362
00:15:31,598 --> 00:15:34,567
- Ask your mama if I'm
unlucky motherfucker.

363
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:36,569
- Why you gotta go there?

364
00:15:36,603 --> 00:15:38,405
- [Wesley] Why not?

365
00:15:38,438 --> 00:15:40,573
They need to hurry up, 'cuz
my drink is getting limp.

366
00:15:41,941 --> 00:15:44,411
- Anything you got is limp,
limp-dick motherfucker.

367
00:15:44,444 --> 00:15:46,813
- I give to you, my
friends, a treasure.

368
00:15:46,846 --> 00:15:47,647
- Fuck you.

369
00:15:47,680 --> 00:15:48,348
- Fuck you.

370
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:49,049
- Fuck you.

371
00:15:49,082 --> 00:15:49,716
- Fuck you.

372
00:15:49,749 --> 00:15:50,917
- Fuck you.

373
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:51,751
- [Groom] Believe
it or not, a prize.

374
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:53,486
(glass chime together)

375
00:15:53,520 --> 00:15:54,587
- Fuck you.

376
00:15:55,788 --> 00:15:57,424
- Fuck both of y'all.

377
00:15:57,457 --> 00:16:00,127
- May God bless some lucky man.

378
00:16:02,762 --> 00:16:04,864
- Ain't y'all gonna get it?

379
00:16:04,897 --> 00:16:05,698
- Fuck you.

380
00:16:06,799 --> 00:16:08,368
- [Wesley] It get's
very, very intimidating.

381
00:16:08,401 --> 00:16:09,402
I'm gonna get me some.

382
00:16:09,436 --> 00:16:14,441
(R&B music)

383
00:16:16,643 --> 00:16:19,779
- Tell us, when was the
last time you had a woman?

384
00:16:19,812 --> 00:16:23,216
Just any time, tell us when
was the last time when.

385
00:16:23,250 --> 00:16:26,119
Otherwise, you need to shut
the fuck up until then, nigga.

386
00:16:26,153 --> 00:16:27,920
(laughing)

387
00:16:27,954 --> 00:16:29,556
- Listen, let me
tell you what you do.

388
00:16:29,589 --> 00:16:31,424
- [Chris] No, no,
no, I'll tell you.

389
00:16:31,458 --> 00:16:34,127
- Nigga, you can't tell me
shit in the shape you in.

390
00:16:34,161 --> 00:16:35,628
- Please, listen to me.

391
00:16:35,662 --> 00:16:36,963
Between a man and a woman,

392
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,632
everything is controlled.

393
00:16:39,666 --> 00:16:42,235
There is but one master
who possesses the object

394
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:44,237
of the other's desire hold.

395
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:47,974
One authority commands
the keys to the kingdom

396
00:16:48,007 --> 00:16:49,409
around which is gate,

397
00:16:49,442 --> 00:16:52,645
where and the other outside
is required to wait.

398
00:16:52,679 --> 00:16:56,149
Make no false move, lest
you give yourself away,

399
00:16:56,183 --> 00:16:59,652
betraying your feelings
puts the other on you.

400
00:16:59,686 --> 00:17:03,890
Kisses connive,
embraces deceive.

401
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:07,160
Watch your back, says
your lover, if you was me,

402
00:17:07,194 --> 00:17:10,730
lest you lose the floodgates
to expanding your heart

403
00:17:10,763 --> 00:17:15,435
filling your soul with ecstasy
to sanctify every part.

404
00:17:16,536 --> 00:17:20,940
Your love, something
that begins all acquired

405
00:17:20,973 --> 00:17:22,875
and ends deafening you.

406
00:17:24,544 --> 00:17:28,648
Her eyes, the pools of
coolness that you swim through.

407
00:17:28,681 --> 00:17:32,385
Her voice, the music of angels
that strum at your heart.

408
00:17:33,886 --> 00:17:36,489
Tender and moist and
serene to the touch,

409
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:41,128
her body, God with
the power to bless.

410
00:17:41,161 --> 00:17:44,131
- With all that,
you ain't said shit.

411
00:17:44,164 --> 00:17:46,233
- [Glenn] Shit,
that's knowledge.

412
00:17:47,134 --> 00:17:49,269
- You must have to be dumb.

413
00:17:49,302 --> 00:17:51,671
- Nigga, I ain't gotta be
dumb to whoop your bitch ass.

414
00:17:51,704 --> 00:17:53,206
- No-pussy-getting motherfucker,

415
00:17:53,240 --> 00:17:55,041
always fucking with somebody.

416
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:58,378
- All I asked Glenn, nigga,
is what are gonna do?

417
00:17:58,411 --> 00:17:59,812
- I don't have to do anything.

418
00:17:59,846 --> 00:18:02,048
- That's perfect right there.

419
00:18:02,081 --> 00:18:03,716
- He turned off all the engines

420
00:18:03,750 --> 00:18:05,685
and the pilot has
to come to him.

421
00:18:07,554 --> 00:18:09,356
- Don't be a fool, dude.

422
00:18:09,389 --> 00:18:11,023
She got your number, man.

423
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:13,460
It ain't no
protection from that.

424
00:18:13,493 --> 00:18:15,228
- Man, she's just a
woman like anyone else.

425
00:18:15,262 --> 00:18:17,029
- No, you just a woman.

426
00:18:17,063 --> 00:18:19,866
(laughing)

427
00:18:19,899 --> 00:18:21,134
- Listen to this punk.

428
00:18:21,168 --> 00:18:23,236
She's guilty man,
I'm telling you.

429
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:26,239
- Give me a motherfucking
break, motherfucker.

430
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:29,642
Please, I mean, this
girl could eat glass.

431
00:18:29,676 --> 00:18:31,644
She don't give a damn about you.

432
00:18:31,678 --> 00:18:35,148
To do what she did,
or else how could she?

433
00:18:35,182 --> 00:18:37,584
I'm telling, this
is how sisters are.

434
00:18:37,617 --> 00:18:39,486
This is what they do.

435
00:18:39,519 --> 00:18:42,255
She is trampling all
the fuck over you.

436
00:18:42,289 --> 00:18:44,090
- Sisters will do that.

437
00:18:44,123 --> 00:18:46,159
- [Wesley] That's
exactly what they do.

438
00:18:46,193 --> 00:18:48,161
They cut off your Johnson,
then they serve it to you,

439
00:18:48,195 --> 00:18:49,529
after they microwave it.

440
00:18:49,562 --> 00:18:51,164
- Sisters, I know.

441
00:18:51,198 --> 00:18:53,166
(laughing)

442
00:18:53,200 --> 00:18:55,335
- Sisters don't play.

443
00:18:55,368 --> 00:19:00,373
(R&B music)

444
00:19:05,812 --> 00:19:09,616
- We are the same, I just
want you to know that

445
00:19:09,649 --> 00:19:13,085
everything is going
to work out, okay?

446
00:19:13,119 --> 00:19:14,287
- You really think so?

447
00:19:14,321 --> 00:19:15,788
- Baby, I know so.

448
00:19:15,822 --> 00:19:18,191
- (scoffs) Alright,
if you say so.

449
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,959
- (mumbles) okay.

450
00:19:19,992 --> 00:19:21,294
- Can you get me
something to drink, baby?

451
00:19:21,328 --> 00:19:22,895
- Sure.

452
00:19:22,929 --> 00:19:24,231
- Thanks.

453
00:19:32,138 --> 00:19:33,373
- [Man] Hey baby, excuse me.

454
00:19:33,406 --> 00:19:34,907
Is this seat taken?

455
00:19:39,078 --> 00:19:42,815
Why don't you join
me in the Jacuzzi?

456
00:19:42,849 --> 00:19:44,183
Come on.

457
00:19:55,194 --> 00:19:57,597
- [Voiceover] Now,
he's straight fronting.

458
00:19:57,630 --> 00:19:59,499
His mind ain't on dominoes.

459
00:19:59,532 --> 00:20:00,833
Since that woman left his ass,

460
00:20:00,867 --> 00:20:03,202
man, he's been all jacked up.

461
00:20:04,537 --> 00:20:06,973
All that shit he talking,
nothing but a front.

462
00:20:08,174 --> 00:20:09,976
Underneath it all,
he all bruised up.

463
00:20:11,043 --> 00:20:12,612
He talks like he's beyond it,

464
00:20:13,646 --> 00:20:15,315
but let's see who brings it up.

465
00:20:16,182 --> 00:20:17,216
I'm not.

466
00:20:19,986 --> 00:20:21,721
- I didn't have a
muscle to stand.

467
00:20:23,022 --> 00:20:25,024
I was broadsided,
you understand.

468
00:20:26,225 --> 00:20:28,495
One minute I'm in
my cozy little room,

469
00:20:29,862 --> 00:20:31,230
then came a tornado.

470
00:20:32,532 --> 00:20:34,233
Tossed me through hellfire,

471
00:20:35,635 --> 00:20:37,904
a thousand miles elsewhere
landed me somewhere,

472
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:40,740
somewhere I know not.
- [Woman] This feels so good.

473
00:20:42,909 --> 00:20:44,911
She fixed her mouth
to say it's over.

474
00:20:46,346 --> 00:20:48,315
How she managed to put
those words together

475
00:20:48,348 --> 00:20:49,749
is beyond me today.

476
00:20:51,150 --> 00:20:53,219
She was unhappy.

477
00:20:53,252 --> 00:20:54,821
I had no idea.

478
00:20:56,556 --> 00:20:59,058
Gravity compelled
me to my knees.

479
00:20:59,091 --> 00:21:02,462
I begged without
interruption, please.

480
00:21:02,495 --> 00:21:05,565
How could she do this to me?

481
00:21:05,598 --> 00:21:10,603
Myself, our
daughter, the family.

482
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:14,541
It could not be done.

483
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:18,110
Oh it was out of her control.

484
00:21:19,512 --> 00:21:22,882
She may as well have said
that day, "God broke with me."

485
00:21:22,915 --> 00:21:26,819
If I was unworthy of
forgiveness, then so was he.

486
00:21:26,853 --> 00:21:30,590
An internal flame consumed
me from outside within

487
00:21:30,623 --> 00:21:34,361
and with such hatred,
so wrongly baptized.

488
00:21:36,062 --> 00:21:38,097
It was a miracle I didn't die.

489
00:21:39,298 --> 00:21:41,968
Everybody had died, it
was just the same as.

490
00:21:43,736 --> 00:21:48,408
To say it as unbearable is
to only hint at the truth.

491
00:21:49,609 --> 00:21:52,445
Clouds rose up and
blackened the sky.

492
00:21:52,479 --> 00:21:54,280
The sun smoldered,
taking my vision,

493
00:21:54,313 --> 00:21:57,817
that nothing existed
between it in my eye.

494
00:21:59,318 --> 00:22:02,221
Neither my step or the
ground together were aware.

495
00:22:03,723 --> 00:22:05,458
I was conscious only of pain,

496
00:22:06,659 --> 00:22:09,429
pain encompassing
all everywhere.

497
00:22:11,130 --> 00:22:13,165
All this and more
I could forgive,

498
00:22:15,668 --> 00:22:18,505
but that she put another
man between her legs,

499
00:22:20,106 --> 00:22:22,575
legs that brought my
child into this world.

500
00:22:22,609 --> 00:22:25,578
That is the reason
that she must die.

501
00:22:26,779 --> 00:22:29,849
So, tonight as the cock
crows, so she will lie.

502
00:22:31,183 --> 00:22:33,486
It will be brutal
- [Chris] Talking all that

503
00:22:33,520 --> 00:22:36,055
and so hurt.
- [Chris] shit (mumbling).

504
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,323
- Check this out,
check this out.

505
00:22:37,356 --> 00:22:42,361
(hip-hop music
drowns out speech)

506
00:23:33,880 --> 00:23:35,347
- You gonna play or not?

507
00:23:35,381 --> 00:23:36,816
What are you throwing out?

508
00:23:36,849 --> 00:23:38,050
- Connect the dots, man.

509
00:23:38,084 --> 00:23:39,318
- Come on, man.

510
00:23:39,351 --> 00:23:40,787
- Then she told me one day,

511
00:23:40,820 --> 00:23:42,622
I'd be grateful
for what happened.

512
00:23:42,655 --> 00:23:44,156
Said "You gonna
thank me one day."

513
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:46,759
- Shit man, I'd kill a bitch
do some shit like that to me.

514
00:23:48,360 --> 00:23:50,730
Excuse my language.

515
00:23:50,763 --> 00:23:52,231
- You would not.

516
00:23:52,264 --> 00:23:54,834
- Shit, nigga, I'm a
cold-blooded motherfucker.

517
00:23:54,867 --> 00:23:57,036
You may think I'm not.

518
00:23:57,069 --> 00:23:58,738
You can kid yourself
all you like, baby,

519
00:23:58,771 --> 00:24:02,074
but believe me I ain't playing.

520
00:24:02,108 --> 00:24:03,409
- Alright all y'all.

521
00:24:03,442 --> 00:24:05,478
- You ain't got to believe me.

522
00:24:05,512 --> 00:24:07,246
Do something and find out.

523
00:24:07,279 --> 00:24:08,715
- Whatever you say, OJ.

524
00:24:08,748 --> 00:24:10,917
- OJ is right. You'll be
waiting to get out of jail.

525
00:24:10,950 --> 00:24:13,252
- Y'all let them women treat
y'all like a bunch of bitches,

526
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:14,687
but to me they will not.

527
00:24:14,721 --> 00:24:15,955
- That's right.

528
00:24:18,725 --> 00:24:23,395
- So, Chris, do you love me?

529
00:24:26,799 --> 00:24:28,267
- [Chris] Oh, get out.

530
00:24:29,435 --> 00:24:31,604
- (laughing) What?

531
00:24:32,539 --> 00:24:34,774
(laughing)

532
00:24:34,807 --> 00:24:37,109
What, what do you
mean "get out"?

533
00:24:38,645 --> 00:24:40,379
We're in the middle of nowhere.

534
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:41,814
Are you kidding?

535
00:24:45,284 --> 00:24:46,485
You're serious.

536
00:24:47,887 --> 00:24:49,455
You're serious,
you're not kidding?

537
00:24:49,488 --> 00:24:50,923
Quit playing, Chris.

538
00:24:52,091 --> 00:24:53,292
You're serious? We're in
the middle of nowhere.

539
00:24:53,325 --> 00:24:55,461
How am I? Where
am I going to go?

540
00:25:00,833 --> 00:25:01,968
- [Operator] Thank you, ma'am.

541
00:25:02,001 --> 00:25:04,503
Your taxi will be
available in 45 minutes.

542
00:25:07,006 --> 00:25:09,642
- With all due respect,
Chris, kiss my ass.

543
00:25:09,676 --> 00:25:11,978
- Damn, nigga, I'm waiting
for a couple hoes right now.

544
00:25:12,011 --> 00:25:13,813
What the fuck are you doing?

545
00:25:13,846 --> 00:25:16,315
I'm feeling sorry for
you, you pitiful man.

546
00:25:16,348 --> 00:25:17,817
- If you ever looked
in the mirror,

547
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:20,052
you'd see that you ain't
got enough pity to spare.

548
00:25:20,086 --> 00:25:22,321
- [Wesley] You
know what's a trip?

549
00:25:22,354 --> 00:25:24,624
How after your girl
gives you the rule,

550
00:25:24,657 --> 00:25:26,158
and how beautiful she gets?

551
00:25:26,192 --> 00:25:27,393
- Ain't that the truth.

552
00:25:27,426 --> 00:25:28,961
- You could be
unfortunate in the face,

553
00:25:28,995 --> 00:25:30,396
blind in one eye,

554
00:25:30,429 --> 00:25:33,132
but you be wringing your
hands to keep from the crowd.

555
00:25:34,033 --> 00:25:36,836
- Yeah, that's the truth, too.

556
00:25:36,869 --> 00:25:38,605
- Baby can sound so
innocent and sweet

557
00:25:38,638 --> 00:25:41,507
with a venom that
no poison can beat.

558
00:25:41,540 --> 00:25:44,176
- Now, which thing
she did was this?

559
00:25:44,210 --> 00:25:46,012
- Eventually, she say some
other woman is going to be

560
00:25:46,045 --> 00:25:47,680
lucky to have me one day.

561
00:25:47,714 --> 00:25:49,649
- Oh, that's a body slam there.

562
00:25:49,682 --> 00:25:51,450
- When you find somebody,

563
00:25:51,483 --> 00:25:53,019
she gonna be mad then.

564
00:25:53,052 --> 00:25:54,687
- [Glenn] Man, I was
trying so hard to be cool.

565
00:25:54,721 --> 00:25:56,789
I told her no more,
not to do that,

566
00:25:56,823 --> 00:25:58,691
and now to this
day, swear to God,

567
00:25:58,725 --> 00:26:00,192
she haven't stopped yet.

568
00:26:00,226 --> 00:26:01,527
- I'd be adding them up.

569
00:26:01,560 --> 00:26:02,962
That's another ass-whooping
coming you got.

570
00:26:02,995 --> 00:26:03,930
(laughing)

571
00:26:03,963 --> 00:26:05,264
- You think I'm lying.

572
00:26:05,297 --> 00:26:08,034
It's torture and
it's intentional.

573
00:26:08,067 --> 00:26:10,937
- [Wesley] Mmm-hmm, 'cuz a
scorned woman's fury is hell.

574
00:26:10,970 --> 00:26:12,972
- Worse thing is, I
didn't deserve it.

575
00:26:13,005 --> 00:26:15,942
- Oh, please, nigga that's a
God-damned lie right there.

576
00:26:15,975 --> 00:26:18,711
You would've dogged that bitch
out anytime you could have.

577
00:26:18,745 --> 00:26:20,947
First time somebody
gave you an opportunity.

578
00:26:20,980 --> 00:26:22,214
- Don't try to run my business.

579
00:26:22,248 --> 00:26:24,550
Sure, I was tempted
but I never did.

580
00:26:24,583 --> 00:26:26,018
That's the difference
right there.

581
00:26:26,052 --> 00:26:28,554
- The difference right
there is you a hypocrite.

582
00:26:28,587 --> 00:26:30,657
That's what you are.

583
00:26:30,690 --> 00:26:32,058
Anything wrong
with somebody else,

584
00:26:32,091 --> 00:26:33,793
you the first one
to point it out.

585
00:26:33,826 --> 00:26:36,028
- No, nobody can loan
even a dollar to you.

586
00:26:36,062 --> 00:26:38,731
You loan him a dollar,
don't expect to see it back.

587
00:26:38,765 --> 00:26:40,633
He'll make a deduction
for every favor,

588
00:26:40,667 --> 00:26:42,468
counting from the
first one back.

589
00:26:42,501 --> 00:26:45,071
"Don't you remember when
I did so-and-so for you?"

590
00:26:45,104 --> 00:26:46,906
I mean, not that that's
what he'll tell you,

591
00:26:46,939 --> 00:26:48,574
but only to himself.

592
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:50,209
Anybody claim a
debt that you owe,

593
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:51,811
you'll credit them blame.

594
00:26:51,844 --> 00:26:53,212
Calling me a hypocrite.

595
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,415
- Hold, hold, hold the
fuck on right there.

596
00:26:56,448 --> 00:26:57,684
Now, wait a minute, man.

597
00:26:57,717 --> 00:27:00,019
Now, what about that
patient I sent you?

598
00:27:00,052 --> 00:27:03,255
After hearing his case, you
tell me who I thought about.

599
00:27:03,289 --> 00:27:05,925
Who? Who could
make all the money?

600
00:27:05,958 --> 00:27:08,360
You fucking cleaned up.

601
00:27:08,394 --> 00:27:10,362
Why should I expect anything?

602
00:27:10,396 --> 00:27:11,597
You're the
motherfucking surgeon.

603
00:27:11,630 --> 00:27:13,565
You did all the work,

604
00:27:13,599 --> 00:27:16,769
even though not a damned
thing was wrong with his neck.

605
00:27:16,803 --> 00:27:19,271
And why should you, huh?

606
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:22,008
Nigga, I brought you a
motherfucking goldmine.

607
00:27:22,041 --> 00:27:24,010
Now, you tell me if
that had been you,

608
00:27:24,043 --> 00:27:26,913
you wouldn't have made some
type of stake in that shit,

609
00:27:26,946 --> 00:27:29,248
some type of claim to find.

610
00:27:29,281 --> 00:27:30,717
And now, you want
to talk about this

611
00:27:30,750 --> 00:27:32,518
piss-ass change I owe you.

612
00:27:32,551 --> 00:27:34,620
Motherfucker, I don't owe
you a god-damned dime.

613
00:27:34,653 --> 00:27:36,122
- What I tell you?

614
00:27:36,155 --> 00:27:37,857
- No, no, the money ain't
even the motherfucking point.

615
00:27:37,890 --> 00:27:40,860
The point is, it's that
same thing with your woman.

616
00:27:40,893 --> 00:27:43,763
How high her legs are
in there, I don't care.

617
00:27:43,796 --> 00:27:46,699
But you curse yourself
every time you swear.

618
00:27:46,733 --> 00:27:48,267
- Wait, wait a minute.

619
00:27:48,300 --> 00:27:49,769
- What?

620
00:27:49,802 --> 00:27:50,970
Oh, it's alright for you to
fuck other people's wives.

621
00:27:51,003 --> 00:27:53,305
You just don't want
nobody fucking yours.

622
00:27:53,339 --> 00:27:54,741
- Well, as long as you're
not fucking my wife,

623
00:27:54,774 --> 00:27:56,242
what business is it of yours?

624
00:27:56,275 --> 00:27:57,376
- How do you know I haven't?

625
00:27:57,409 --> 00:27:59,311
- [Group] Woah, woah, woah.

626
00:27:59,345 --> 00:28:01,380
- Somebody just tell me
what the fuck is going on?

627
00:28:01,413 --> 00:28:03,082
- Look, wait everybody,
just wait a minute.

628
00:28:03,115 --> 00:28:04,316
- Look, what are
you trying to say?

629
00:28:04,350 --> 00:28:05,818
- What you misunderstood
what I said?

630
00:28:05,852 --> 00:28:08,287
- No, motherfucker I didn't
misunderstand a damned thing,

631
00:28:08,320 --> 00:28:10,389
but if you want to clarify,
you go right ahead.

632
00:28:10,422 --> 00:28:11,991
- I ain't gotta
clarify a damned thing,

633
00:28:12,024 --> 00:28:13,993
like I give a fuck
what you think.

634
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,127
- I warned you, motherfucker.

635
00:28:15,161 --> 00:28:16,662
Now, you want to test me?

636
00:28:16,695 --> 00:28:19,231
- It's that motherfucker
who's you need to kick ass.

637
00:28:19,265 --> 00:28:21,567
- Everybody just
calm the fuck down.

638
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,502
- You better grab that
motherfucker before I do.

639
00:28:23,535 --> 00:28:25,171
- Nigga, you ain't
grabbing nobody, who?

640
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:27,273
- Hey, look man, the man
is fucking your wife, okay.

641
00:28:27,306 --> 00:28:29,175
That's who you need to
choke. Choke him out.

642
00:28:29,208 --> 00:28:31,744
- No warnings, just ass
whipping from here out.

643
00:28:31,778 --> 00:28:33,512
- What are you gonna
do to me, sissy?

644
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,447
Same thing you did
to your woman's man?

645
00:28:35,481 --> 00:28:36,682
- [Samuel] On general principle,

646
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:38,484
the motherfucker
ought to be dead.

647
00:28:38,517 --> 00:28:40,486
- [Wesley] Son of a
bitch, you go to far.

648
00:28:40,519 --> 00:28:41,788
- Hey look man, let him alone.

649
00:28:41,821 --> 00:28:43,289
That's what he needs to hear.

650
00:28:43,322 --> 00:28:45,825
Hey look man, cold-cock
that punk when he's alone.

651
00:28:45,858 --> 00:28:47,193
- [Glenn] You better
close your mouth.

652
00:28:47,226 --> 00:28:48,627
- Threatening is all you
can do when all it takes

653
00:28:48,660 --> 00:28:50,262
is a little girl to cripple you.

654
00:28:50,296 --> 00:28:51,297
- What's gotta be
wrong with you man?

655
00:28:51,330 --> 00:28:52,698
You go too far for what?

656
00:28:52,731 --> 00:28:55,501
- Look, anybody's a fool
to sit on his hands.

657
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,702
That's your woman, man.

658
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:58,370
Take back what's yours.

659
00:28:58,404 --> 00:28:59,872
- No, he can't claim
what ain't his.

660
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:03,175
- Just shut up. All of
you just shut the fuck up.

661
00:29:03,209 --> 00:29:04,911
- Fuck you, Wesley, fuck you.

662
00:29:06,245 --> 00:29:08,647
Bitch, I'll kill all
of you motherfuckers,

663
00:29:08,680 --> 00:29:11,217
'cuz that's just how I
am, nigga, I don't care.

664
00:29:11,250 --> 00:29:12,451
You can call it genes.

665
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,786
You can call it demons.

666
00:29:13,820 --> 00:29:16,455
You can call it personality.

667
00:29:16,488 --> 00:29:19,525
Apologize, for what,
when it's a lie?

668
00:29:19,558 --> 00:29:20,893
Only apology you're
gonna get from me

669
00:29:20,927 --> 00:29:23,896
is me pulling my motherfucking
knife out your back,

670
00:29:23,930 --> 00:29:25,998
God-damned hypocrite.

671
00:29:26,032 --> 00:29:29,735
- No, you're gonna apologize,
if I have to make you.

672
00:29:29,768 --> 00:29:32,738
- Bitch, you better move
that motherfucking finger.

673
00:29:32,771 --> 00:29:35,141
- You gonna regret this
day, from every day now on.

674
00:29:35,174 --> 00:29:36,909
- Just fucking shut up.

675
00:29:36,943 --> 00:29:39,946
- [Voiceover] Fellas, fellas.
Can't we all just get along?

676
00:29:41,013 --> 00:29:42,748
Bitch, motherfucker.

677
00:29:44,116 --> 00:29:49,121
(phone ringing)

678
00:29:51,757 --> 00:29:52,724
- Hello?

679
00:29:54,093 --> 00:29:56,595
Oh, hey baby.

680
00:29:58,264 --> 00:29:59,298
Nothing.

681
00:30:00,366 --> 00:30:02,301
Nothing, just getting dressed.

682
00:30:03,469 --> 00:30:05,004
Oh, I'm getting ready
to go do some dancing.

683
00:30:05,037 --> 00:30:08,307
Thought I would go out and
do some dancing someplace.

684
00:30:09,976 --> 00:30:11,210
No, I don't know.

685
00:30:13,612 --> 00:30:14,981
Oh, is that your other line?

686
00:30:16,382 --> 00:30:17,649
Oh, okay baby.

687
00:30:18,885 --> 00:30:20,452
Yeah, for a while.

688
00:30:24,090 --> 00:30:25,858
- [Samuel] Don't tell me.

689
00:30:25,892 --> 00:30:27,226
- [Glenn] She got another call.

690
00:30:27,259 --> 00:30:28,460
Said she'd call back.

691
00:30:28,494 --> 00:30:29,795
- [Chris] And now
she should be calling

692
00:30:29,828 --> 00:30:31,630
that motherfucker back.

693
00:30:31,663 --> 00:30:33,365
Instead she's calling you.

694
00:30:33,399 --> 00:30:34,466
- [Samuel] She's
got your black ass

695
00:30:34,500 --> 00:30:35,701
on permanent hold.

696
00:30:35,734 --> 00:30:36,969
- [Wesley] That's
patience right there.

697
00:30:37,003 --> 00:30:39,805
If you can't have
patience, forget it.

698
00:30:39,838 --> 00:30:42,875
Then, you're losing
control of yourself.

699
00:30:42,909 --> 00:30:44,110
- [Chris] Okay, well
let's see how long

700
00:30:44,143 --> 00:30:46,278
you're waiting until
your next call.

701
00:30:46,312 --> 00:30:49,315
Then, we're gonna see
how patient you are.

702
00:30:49,348 --> 00:30:50,316
- [Wesley] You think, for once,

703
00:30:50,349 --> 00:30:51,951
that this nigga ain't patient?

704
00:30:51,984 --> 00:30:53,219
He's begging so hard,

705
00:30:53,252 --> 00:30:54,987
his knees are scraping
up against the ground,

706
00:30:55,021 --> 00:30:56,755
just hoping, just one time,

707
00:30:56,788 --> 00:30:58,891
that that little
phone will ring.

708
00:30:58,925 --> 00:31:01,160
It's all about
control, can't you see.

709
00:31:01,193 --> 00:31:02,895
- [Chris] (mumbles)
I'm telling you.

710
00:31:02,929 --> 00:31:05,497
You think she don't
have control of him?

711
00:31:05,531 --> 00:31:07,666
- [Wesley] No, no, no,
baby. Patience, please.

712
00:31:07,699 --> 00:31:09,001
- [Samuel] No, no,
no, no, look bitch.

713
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,903
You don't see him
calling her, do you?

714
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,138
- [Glenn] I don't
call her for nothing.

715
00:31:12,171 --> 00:31:17,176
(R&B music playing)

716
00:31:18,945 --> 00:31:20,746
- [Chris] You
think she's guilty.

717
00:31:20,779 --> 00:31:22,181
I mean, what happened
between you two

718
00:31:22,214 --> 00:31:24,583
was because of what
both of y'all did.

719
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:26,252
You think she's sad right now?

720
00:31:26,285 --> 00:31:28,187
Nigga, don't even
try and do that.

721
00:31:28,220 --> 00:31:31,023
And anyway, you said that
you ain't did nothing,

722
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,624
according to you.

723
00:31:34,660 --> 00:31:35,761
- What did you say?

724
00:31:35,794 --> 00:31:37,964
- What did I say, what?

725
00:31:37,997 --> 00:31:40,732
- [Glenn] Just now,
what did you say?

726
00:31:43,902 --> 00:31:45,337
- What did I say about what?

727
00:31:45,371 --> 00:31:48,007
- I didn't do nothing, according
to me, was what you said.

728
00:31:48,040 --> 00:31:49,541
- That's what you did.

729
00:31:49,575 --> 00:31:51,377
- [Chris] Yeah, well, nigga I
could have said anything. So?

730
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,544
- But you said according to me.

731
00:31:52,578 --> 00:31:53,879
- Well, what if I did?

732
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,015
If I did, I was just
repeating what you said.

733
00:31:56,048 --> 00:31:59,551
(laughing)

734
00:31:59,585 --> 00:32:01,387
- [Glenn] Uh, uh.

735
00:32:01,420 --> 00:32:03,855
I didn't do nothing,
was what I said.

736
00:32:03,889 --> 00:32:06,392
But what you said
was, according to me.

737
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,894
What I wanna know is
where you got that?

738
00:32:08,927 --> 00:32:10,729
- Does anybody know
what this motherfucker

739
00:32:10,762 --> 00:32:12,231
is talking about?

740
00:32:12,264 --> 00:32:15,701
- According to me, means you
got another side to compare.

741
00:32:15,734 --> 00:32:18,270
- He's saying you got another
viewpoint from somewhere.

742
00:32:19,271 --> 00:32:20,206
- Like from who?

743
00:32:21,673 --> 00:32:23,142
- [Glenn] You know from who.

744
00:32:23,175 --> 00:32:25,044
- No, no, no, nigga. Take
that look out your eye.

745
00:32:25,077 --> 00:32:27,846
- You know who. I'm asking you.

746
00:32:32,184 --> 00:32:35,521
- Yeah, well,
nevermind what I said.

747
00:32:35,554 --> 00:32:36,755
You wanna know what I think?

748
00:32:36,788 --> 00:32:38,090
I think you're losing
your God-damned mind.

749
00:32:38,124 --> 00:32:40,359
That's what I think.

750
00:32:40,392 --> 00:32:42,328
- You've been talking to her.

751
00:32:42,361 --> 00:32:44,830
- (scoffs) I ain't been
talking to nobody, man.

752
00:32:44,863 --> 00:32:46,932
And wait, what if I was?

753
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:48,167
What you gonna do to me?

754
00:32:48,200 --> 00:32:49,535
What, threaten me again?

755
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,370
Is that all you can do?

756
00:32:51,403 --> 00:32:52,604
You gonna threaten me to death?

757
00:32:52,638 --> 00:32:53,605
- Don't get slapped.

758
00:32:53,639 --> 00:32:55,374
- Man, who's gonna get slapped?

759
00:32:55,407 --> 00:32:58,044
Anybody slap me'll be a dead
motherfucker in this place.

760
00:32:58,077 --> 00:33:00,412
- It seems like you do a
whole lot of threatening, too.

761
00:33:00,446 --> 00:33:01,780
- Man, nigga, just
stay out of shit when

762
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:03,282
ain't nobody talking to you.

763
00:33:03,315 --> 00:33:04,716
- You know what, man, I'll
put my foot in your ass.

764
00:33:04,750 --> 00:33:05,917
- Yeah, well.

765
00:33:05,951 --> 00:33:07,619
Anytime you ready to
die motherfucker, do it.

766
00:33:07,653 --> 00:33:09,055
- Well, fuck you, motherfucker.

767
00:33:09,088 --> 00:33:10,956
- Man, get your motherfucking
shoe off of my chair.

768
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:14,293
- Fuck you, bitch. Asshole.

769
00:33:14,326 --> 00:33:17,796
- [Voiceover] Every puzzle in
its piece I have together now,

770
00:33:17,829 --> 00:33:19,665
and such adjoining.

771
00:33:22,068 --> 00:33:23,602
Now, I'm fit to kill.

772
00:33:24,736 --> 00:33:27,873
All together, with
one slice missing out.

773
00:33:27,906 --> 00:33:32,311
Using to conspire secretly
what alibi is about.

774
00:33:32,344 --> 00:33:35,614
My innocence is secure
as lovers at first sight.

775
00:33:36,982 --> 00:33:38,884
I'll surprise you in your sleep,

776
00:33:38,917 --> 00:33:41,253
that you need never to wake.

777
00:33:41,287 --> 00:33:44,090
Stealing your life
as you did mine,

778
00:33:44,123 --> 00:33:47,459
before you can
suspect the crime.

779
00:33:47,493 --> 00:33:49,428
- [Voiceover] They
talk about violence,

780
00:33:49,461 --> 00:33:52,431
like if it was
something cool to do.

781
00:33:52,464 --> 00:33:54,333
Who among us can say
there hasn't been a time

782
00:33:54,366 --> 00:33:57,636
when they weren't
swept up in the thing?

783
00:33:57,669 --> 00:34:02,608
(cheering)

784
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:07,646
(R&B music drowns out speech)

785
00:34:11,983 --> 00:34:14,186
- Take it out.

786
00:34:14,220 --> 00:34:15,621
All right, let's go.

787
00:34:15,654 --> 00:34:20,659
(music drowns out speech)

788
00:34:21,227 --> 00:34:25,231
(yelling)

789
00:34:26,698 --> 00:34:28,334
- [Man] Hold, hold,
hold, hold up.

790
00:34:28,367 --> 00:34:29,535
Game over, my man.

791
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:31,837
Woody Wood in the
motherfucking house.

792
00:34:31,870 --> 00:34:33,004
- [Wesley] What's up
with your shit man?

793
00:34:33,038 --> 00:34:35,207
- Man, fuck you. What's
up with your shit?

794
00:34:35,241 --> 00:34:40,246
(laughing)

795
00:34:42,047 --> 00:34:43,482
- No, no, no. My boys
are on their way.

796
00:34:43,515 --> 00:34:45,284
You motherfuckers got to bounce.

797
00:34:45,317 --> 00:34:47,219
- [Samuel] Wait,
wait, wait a minute.

798
00:34:47,253 --> 00:34:48,887
This is a public park, nigga.

799
00:34:48,920 --> 00:34:50,656
(arguing)

800
00:34:50,689 --> 00:34:52,158
- What are you
motherfucker, man.

801
00:34:53,259 --> 00:34:54,360
(punching thud)

802
00:34:57,763 --> 00:35:02,100
(kicking and screaming)

803
00:35:07,105 --> 00:35:10,576
- What does this
have to do with OJ?

804
00:35:10,609 --> 00:35:12,077
What, you think he did it?

805
00:35:12,110 --> 00:35:13,845
- [Group] Hell yeah.

806
00:35:13,879 --> 00:35:15,881
- [Chris] Listen, man.
Y'all are some fools, man.

807
00:35:15,914 --> 00:35:19,885
All of y'all, call
yourselves black men.

808
00:35:19,918 --> 00:35:22,988
- How are you gonna rationalize
so many coincidences?

809
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:24,990
- It wasn't no fucking
coincidences, man.

810
00:35:25,023 --> 00:35:26,258
Y'all just some sellouts.

811
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:28,093
- OJ Simpson killed Nicole.

812
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:29,161
- Oh man, that's
a lie right there.

813
00:35:29,195 --> 00:35:30,429
- The brother was framed.

814
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,164
- And that's
exactly what he was.

815
00:35:32,198 --> 00:35:33,732
- They all, the police,
in on this conspiracy.

816
00:35:33,765 --> 00:35:35,867
- Soon as a black man
gets any amount of power,

817
00:35:35,901 --> 00:35:37,669
they just sneak up from
behind and take it.

818
00:35:37,703 --> 00:35:38,570
- Don't let it be a white woman.

819
00:35:38,604 --> 00:35:39,738
- Oh, no, no.

820
00:35:39,771 --> 00:35:40,939
Then, you can kiss
your black ass goodbye.

821
00:35:40,972 --> 00:35:42,073
- You let the police
get away with that once,

822
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:43,008
and pretty soon--

823
00:35:43,041 --> 00:35:44,109
- Whether they guilty or not.

824
00:35:44,142 --> 00:35:46,278
- You got an
authoritarian state.

825
00:35:46,312 --> 00:35:47,546
They can get anybody--

826
00:35:47,579 --> 00:35:48,447
- I was an illegal
search and seizure.

827
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,681
- Anyplace, anytime.

828
00:35:49,715 --> 00:35:51,049
- Anybody that
happens too white,

829
00:35:51,082 --> 00:35:52,518
the whole case gets thrown out.

830
00:35:52,551 --> 00:35:54,620
- Who knows from where
the evidence, they got it.

831
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:56,588
I mean, it's not their
business to assume

832
00:35:56,622 --> 00:35:57,789
whether you're guilty or not.

833
00:35:57,823 --> 00:35:59,525
And for all of those
years of lynching,

834
00:35:59,558 --> 00:36:01,059
Emmett Tills and everybody else.

835
00:36:01,092 --> 00:36:02,561
Hell, if he didn't do
it, he might as well.

836
00:36:02,594 --> 00:36:03,395
- What about the DNA?

837
00:36:03,429 --> 00:36:04,796
- DNA? Hell.

838
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:06,398
Now, they using micro-biotics
to convict a black man.

839
00:36:06,432 --> 00:36:07,866
- The race card was
played by the defense.

840
00:36:07,899 --> 00:36:10,269
- Whether you're poor,
if you are black,

841
00:36:10,302 --> 00:36:11,937
you are a target.

842
00:36:11,970 --> 00:36:13,472
- And the phone calls.

843
00:36:13,505 --> 00:36:14,740
All what about?

844
00:36:14,773 --> 00:36:15,741
- You can't convict
a black man by that.

845
00:36:15,774 --> 00:36:17,309
- She had kids with that man.

846
00:36:17,343 --> 00:36:18,577
Look, I might not have before,

847
00:36:18,610 --> 00:36:20,646
but now I understand.

848
00:36:20,679 --> 00:36:22,047
- So, you'd kill somebody, too

849
00:36:22,080 --> 00:36:24,483
- Who me? No. (laughing)

850
00:36:24,516 --> 00:36:27,319
- And just because I'd do it,
don't mean that he did it.

851
00:36:27,353 --> 00:36:28,119
- That's right.

852
00:36:28,153 --> 00:36:28,987
- Could you do it?

853
00:36:29,020 --> 00:36:30,121
- [Glenn] Could I what?

854
00:36:30,155 --> 00:36:31,089
- Kill.

855
00:36:31,122 --> 00:36:32,258
- [Glenn] Kill somebody?

856
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:35,461
- Why not? Why not you? Hmm.

857
00:36:35,494 --> 00:36:37,496
- [Glenn] Well, fuck no.

858
00:36:37,529 --> 00:36:40,299
Anybody I put my hands
on wouldn't be her.

859
00:36:40,332 --> 00:36:42,968
- Now see, see how she got
your mind being played?

860
00:36:43,001 --> 00:36:44,169
- Straight out.

861
00:36:44,202 --> 00:36:45,671
- [Glenn] Why?

862
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:46,638
- [Chris] No, I'm gonna show
you what I would have done

863
00:36:46,672 --> 00:36:47,673
if I was OJ.

864
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:48,907
Look.

865
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,175
(stabs table) That's
what OJ (mumbles)

866
00:36:50,208 --> 00:36:51,643
- [Wesley] Fucker, what
you think you're doing.

867
00:36:51,677 --> 00:36:54,346
Get the fuck off, you crazy
bastard, man. Fuck you.

868
00:36:54,380 --> 00:36:56,114
- [Chris] I'm telling you
don't touch my knife, man.

869
00:36:56,147 --> 00:36:58,650
Just because you happy
right now, nigga,

870
00:36:58,684 --> 00:37:00,286
don't be surprised.

871
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:01,420
- [Glenn] Don't be
surprised, what?

872
00:37:01,453 --> 00:37:03,855
- Shit, she's
setting you up, baby.

873
00:37:03,889 --> 00:37:06,525
- Man, the way
she's got you, man.

874
00:37:06,558 --> 00:37:08,527
The way you feel right now,

875
00:37:08,560 --> 00:37:11,029
I bet you it's because that's
how she want him to feel.

876
00:37:11,062 --> 00:37:11,997
- [Samuel] That's right.

877
00:37:12,030 --> 00:37:14,199
(rock music playing)

878
00:37:18,304 --> 00:37:22,674
(car doors slam)

879
00:37:22,708 --> 00:37:24,209
- Darling, you know how I feel.

880
00:37:24,242 --> 00:37:25,277
- Yeah, I know how you feel
but don't worry about that.

881
00:37:25,311 --> 00:37:26,211
Everything's gonna be alright.

882
00:37:26,244 --> 00:37:27,446
- Your friends don't like me.

883
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:28,980
- Come on, let's
have a good time.

884
00:37:29,014 --> 00:37:29,881
- Wesley?

885
00:37:29,915 --> 00:37:31,317
- Misty.

886
00:37:31,350 --> 00:37:33,752
- I see some things
never change.

887
00:37:35,754 --> 00:37:37,656
- You've not met
Wesley's friends.

888
00:37:37,689 --> 00:37:38,657
- No, I heard about this.

889
00:37:38,690 --> 00:37:40,025
It's going to be cool.

890
00:37:40,058 --> 00:37:42,127
- Well, let me explain
something to you about the food.

891
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:43,729
It's a little different.

892
00:37:43,762 --> 00:37:44,796
It's going to be a bit greasy.

893
00:37:44,830 --> 00:37:46,332
There will be pig's feet.

894
00:37:46,365 --> 00:37:47,799
- Pigs feet?

895
00:37:47,833 --> 00:37:51,370
- Yes and I know they trot
around in mud all day,

896
00:37:51,403 --> 00:37:54,740
but somehow they make it work.

897
00:37:54,773 --> 00:37:56,475
And collard greens.

898
00:37:56,508 --> 00:37:58,243
And at first I thought
that they were spinach,

899
00:37:58,276 --> 00:37:59,678
but it's not spinach, actually.

900
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:02,648
Not really, I mean, it's
actually quite bitter.

901
00:38:02,681 --> 00:38:03,882
- Greens?

902
00:38:03,915 --> 00:38:05,684
- Girl, what do you know
about collard greens?

903
00:38:05,717 --> 00:38:07,719
I'm a collard green fiend.

904
00:38:07,753 --> 00:38:10,856
Oh, girl. Don't trip.
I grow collard greens.

905
00:38:10,889 --> 00:38:12,624
- Wesley!
- [pink dress] Mmm, yum.

906
00:38:20,532 --> 00:38:22,000
- Damn, look at Glenn's girl.

907
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,669
It looks like she got finer
since she left that nigga.

908
00:38:23,702 --> 00:38:25,537
- [Friend] Damn, no, shit.

909
00:38:25,571 --> 00:38:28,006
Body is ridiculous,
man. Preposterous.

910
00:38:28,039 --> 00:38:29,775
- It's ludicrous.

911
00:38:29,808 --> 00:38:31,109
- How long they've been
broken up now, anyway?

912
00:38:31,142 --> 00:38:33,779
- Fuck how long.
They broke up, man.

913
00:38:33,812 --> 00:38:34,946
Just because you
step to his girl,

914
00:38:34,980 --> 00:38:36,748
don't mean you doing
something wrong.

915
00:38:36,782 --> 00:38:38,617
- Nigga crying because
he got soft shoes on

916
00:38:38,650 --> 00:38:39,851
and that's what
wrong with the nigga.

917
00:38:39,885 --> 00:38:40,852
He's walking around with
these soft shoes on,

918
00:38:40,886 --> 00:38:41,753
slippers even.

919
00:38:41,787 --> 00:38:43,389
(laughing)
No I'm serious.

920
00:38:43,422 --> 00:38:45,056
You know what, see if it's me,

921
00:38:45,090 --> 00:38:47,025
you can't let a woman have
that kind of power over you.

922
00:38:47,058 --> 00:38:48,293
- [Samuel] That's right.

923
00:38:48,326 --> 00:38:49,461
- [Friend] You know
what I'm saying man?

924
00:38:49,495 --> 00:38:50,929
See, you gotta have
cleats on at all times.

925
00:38:50,962 --> 00:38:52,130
- That's right.

926
00:38:52,163 --> 00:38:53,399
- You let a woman
get over on you,

927
00:38:53,432 --> 00:38:55,066
nigga, she's gonna run
you over every time.

928
00:38:55,100 --> 00:38:56,301
Man, how is Glenn, man?

929
00:38:56,334 --> 00:38:57,268
Anybody see him?

930
00:38:57,302 --> 00:38:58,704
- [Man] I don't want to see him.

931
00:38:58,737 --> 00:39:00,972
I ain't got time to sit
around and watch no fool cry.

932
00:39:01,006 --> 00:39:03,308
(laughing)

933
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,977
- Jeanette called me last night
after talking with Brenda.

934
00:39:06,011 --> 00:39:08,480
- Mmm, girl. I
heard. How is she?

935
00:39:08,514 --> 00:39:09,314
- Oh, you heard?

936
00:39:09,347 --> 00:39:10,215
- Mmm-hmm.

937
00:39:10,248 --> 00:39:11,850
- Wait a minute. What?

938
00:39:12,851 --> 00:39:14,420
- Charlie, drunk as usual,

939
00:39:14,453 --> 00:39:17,288
jumped up and popped
her last night.

940
00:39:17,322 --> 00:39:18,957
- So, he hit her?

941
00:39:18,990 --> 00:39:22,093
- Wait a minute,
on purpose? Why?

942
00:39:22,127 --> 00:39:23,995
- Why? Who gives a damn why?

943
00:39:24,029 --> 00:39:26,164
A man ain't got no business
putting his hands on you.

944
00:39:26,197 --> 00:39:28,099
- He accused her
of sneaking off.

945
00:39:28,133 --> 00:39:30,669
- Did she?

946
00:39:30,702 --> 00:39:33,405
- Miss Thing, it doesn't matter
if she did the whole NBA.

947
00:39:33,439 --> 00:39:35,907
It don't matter. He still
does not give them the right.

948
00:39:35,941 --> 00:39:37,308
- You see a brother down,

949
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,777
you do nothing to encourage
him and to help him.

950
00:39:38,810 --> 00:39:40,245
See, that's the difference
between men and women.

951
00:39:40,278 --> 00:39:42,013
See, women stick together.
- [Man] That's right.

952
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,515
- [Man] See, I'm down
for helping somebody,

953
00:39:43,549 --> 00:39:45,851
but, damn, it's been how long?

954
00:39:45,884 --> 00:39:46,952
- Too long.

955
00:39:46,985 --> 00:39:48,019
- It's ridiculous.

956
00:39:48,053 --> 00:39:49,254
- [Man] Pitiful hostage.

957
00:39:49,287 --> 00:39:50,922
- See, y'all niggas
still tearing him down.

958
00:39:50,956 --> 00:39:52,424
A brother can't get
up with another nigga

959
00:39:52,458 --> 00:39:53,625
tearing him down.

960
00:39:53,659 --> 00:39:55,861
Women, one of them
see one of them down.

961
00:39:55,894 --> 00:39:57,362
Next thing you know
they calling each other.

962
00:39:57,395 --> 00:39:59,364
"Girl, help. I need some help."

963
00:39:59,397 --> 00:40:00,766
There are even girls who
don't like each other,

964
00:40:00,799 --> 00:40:02,333
will call each other to help.

965
00:40:02,367 --> 00:40:04,002
- She's over at
Jeanette's right now

966
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:05,537
trying to hide from him.

967
00:40:05,571 --> 00:40:07,506
- After that, she's gonna come
and stay with me for a while.

968
00:40:07,539 --> 00:40:09,475
- Well, my old
boyfriend, Lester,

969
00:40:09,508 --> 00:40:11,610
he's a supervisor up
there at the firm.

970
00:40:11,643 --> 00:40:13,645
He'll get that dog fired.

971
00:40:13,679 --> 00:40:15,647
All she got to do
is say the word.

972
00:40:15,681 --> 00:40:18,550
Lester do anything for me.

973
00:40:18,584 --> 00:40:20,351
- No, no, no. We shouldn't
do anything just yet.

974
00:40:20,385 --> 00:40:22,053
We don't want to
aggravate his attitude.

975
00:40:22,087 --> 00:40:23,221
- You know what, you're right.

976
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:24,456
- And his temper,
you know how they do.

977
00:40:24,490 --> 00:40:25,691
- Mmm-hmm, if we
fight him too soon,

978
00:40:25,724 --> 00:40:26,892
he's gonna get suspicious

979
00:40:26,925 --> 00:40:28,226
and he might just think
she's responsible.

980
00:40:28,259 --> 00:40:29,461
- [Woman] Yeah, you're right.

981
00:40:29,495 --> 00:40:31,196
Then, we should
wait. That's right.

982
00:40:31,229 --> 00:40:32,731
- Yeah, because
come a few weeks,

983
00:40:32,764 --> 00:40:34,633
he'll be in such bad shape
when he gets his pink slip.

984
00:40:34,666 --> 00:40:36,167
He'll think it's his fault.

985
00:40:36,201 --> 00:40:37,969
Okay, he ain't gonna
know what hit him.

986
00:40:38,003 --> 00:40:40,171
- He'll be so busy
looking for a job,

987
00:40:40,205 --> 00:40:42,207
he won't be worried
about who Brenda is doing

988
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,475
or who she's seeing.

989
00:40:43,509 --> 00:40:46,745
- Okay, that's what
it's all about.

990
00:40:46,778 --> 00:40:48,614
- [Glenn] And now
for the good stuff.

991
00:40:50,181 --> 00:40:52,250
You know what, man.

992
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:57,288
No more "I Love You's"
is my weapon for her.

993
00:40:57,889 --> 00:40:58,857
You hear me?

994
00:41:01,793 --> 00:41:04,129
The only kiss she
gets is in parting.

995
00:41:05,931 --> 00:41:07,298
- You really think she care?

996
00:41:09,100 --> 00:41:11,670
Well, what did she have to say?

997
00:41:11,703 --> 00:41:12,838
- [Glenn] Every word
out of her mouth

998
00:41:12,871 --> 00:41:15,273
is a question in my mind.

999
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:17,509
- Yeah, well, after my divorce,

1000
00:41:17,543 --> 00:41:20,812
Kelly had the nerve to
say she missed me one day.

1001
00:41:21,980 --> 00:41:23,181
- [Wesley] She missed you?

1002
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:26,184
- She missed me.
Ain't that a bitch?

1003
00:41:26,217 --> 00:41:27,352
- [Wesley] Damn.

1004
00:41:27,385 --> 00:41:28,954
- [Chris] I'm
telling you, player,

1005
00:41:28,987 --> 00:41:32,123
nothing I say to you about
her can you even afford

1006
00:41:32,157 --> 00:41:34,092
to second guess.

1007
00:41:35,794 --> 00:41:38,764
- No matter if my thoughts
embrace her all day,

1008
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:42,100
I can't be available anyway, yo.

1009
00:41:42,133 --> 00:41:44,135
- Yeah, well, just don't
get too comfortable,

1010
00:41:44,169 --> 00:41:45,436
whatever you do.

1011
00:41:45,470 --> 00:41:50,408
(R&B music playing)

1012
00:41:52,510 --> 00:41:55,947
- Ooh, woah.

1013
00:41:55,981 --> 00:41:58,650
He would never make
love in the daytime.

1014
00:41:59,785 --> 00:42:02,153
- Come on, never?

1015
00:42:02,187 --> 00:42:04,022
- Uh, uh, believe me.

1016
00:42:05,490 --> 00:42:08,293
That nigga made love like
he was following a road map

1017
00:42:08,326 --> 00:42:11,396
and if I turned the
wrong way, he was lost.

1018
00:42:11,429 --> 00:42:12,397
I mean, lost.

1019
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:13,632
- Not to change the subject,

1020
00:42:13,665 --> 00:42:15,801
but you're talking
about him again.

1021
00:42:15,834 --> 00:42:16,968
- James, I'm sorry.

1022
00:42:17,002 --> 00:42:18,136
I didn't mean anything
by it, alright?

1023
00:42:18,169 --> 00:42:19,905
- You don't need to apologize.

1024
00:42:19,938 --> 00:42:21,673
I ain't fading in the least.

1025
00:42:21,707 --> 00:42:23,241
You better recognize.

1026
00:42:23,274 --> 00:42:26,578
- Recognize? Recognize what?

1027
00:42:26,612 --> 00:42:28,647
- Maybe there's
something still there.

1028
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:32,250
(laughing)

1029
00:42:32,283 --> 00:42:35,020
- How would that make
you feel if it was?

1030
00:42:35,053 --> 00:42:36,521
- The way I feel ain't
got a damned thing to do

1031
00:42:36,554 --> 00:42:38,790
with what anybody
else is feeling.

1032
00:42:39,958 --> 00:42:41,627
- You see, that's
what I like about you.

1033
00:42:41,660 --> 00:42:43,361
I mean, you understand
my need to want to talk

1034
00:42:43,394 --> 00:42:45,196
about that.

1035
00:42:45,230 --> 00:42:46,231
- Always.

1036
00:42:48,233 --> 00:42:49,567
- I think I love him.

1037
00:42:51,036 --> 00:42:53,038
- Yeah, I know you do.

1038
00:42:54,072 --> 00:42:55,306
It's not over, is it?

1039
00:42:57,308 --> 00:43:01,179
- No, if it was over, I wouldn't
be about to cry right now.

1040
00:43:02,347 --> 00:43:03,615
Sorry, I kept you waiting.

1041
00:43:03,649 --> 00:43:06,451
- Oh, that's okay.
That's alright.

1042
00:43:06,484 --> 00:43:08,153
Well, let me ask you
something, though.

1043
00:43:08,186 --> 00:43:11,556
Why couldn't I just have
picked you up at home?

1044
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,058
- No reason.

1045
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:14,660
- I mean, you had to come
this way, It was on your way.

1046
00:43:14,693 --> 00:43:15,961
I mean, we could have
come here together.

1047
00:43:15,994 --> 00:43:18,529
Nobody would have had
to wait for nobody.

1048
00:43:18,563 --> 00:43:20,498
- It's no reason.
We're here now, okay?

1049
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,402
- I guess, I guess you're right.

1050
00:43:24,435 --> 00:43:26,404
I guess that's the main thing.

1051
00:43:26,437 --> 00:43:27,405
So.

1052
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:31,877
What's the special occasion?

1053
00:43:31,910 --> 00:43:35,981
I mean, usually when we get
together, it's usually on me.

1054
00:43:36,014 --> 00:43:38,316
- (laughing) It's
gotta be on somebody.

1055
00:43:38,349 --> 00:43:40,886
- I mean, what I'm saying is
usually whenever we go out,

1056
00:43:40,919 --> 00:43:42,788
I'm the one that makes
the arrangements.

1057
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:46,424
- What difference does it make?

1058
00:43:46,457 --> 00:43:48,026
- When was that, excuse me?

1059
00:43:49,027 --> 00:43:49,928
- You know what?

1060
00:43:49,961 --> 00:43:51,429
This has been going on too long.

1061
00:43:51,462 --> 00:43:54,700
You know, there's the house
that we didn't buy together,

1062
00:43:54,733 --> 00:43:56,902
the trip to the
Grand Cayman Islands.

1063
00:43:56,935 --> 00:43:58,569
I mean, I don't get it.

1064
00:43:58,603 --> 00:44:00,706
The French Riviera,
we never did that.

1065
00:44:00,739 --> 00:44:02,207
You know, what happened
to all of those things?

1066
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:05,711
- Look, Shay. Sales are
down at the office, okay?

1067
00:44:05,744 --> 00:44:07,112
Okay, but look.

1068
00:44:07,145 --> 00:44:09,815
Things are now finally
starting to turn around for me.

1069
00:44:10,982 --> 00:44:12,450
- And I've heard that before.

1070
00:44:14,485 --> 00:44:16,421
How many times do I
have to hear this, huh?

1071
00:44:16,454 --> 00:44:18,957
- Look, how many times
do I have to say it, huh?

1072
00:44:20,726 --> 00:44:22,794
- You know, I don't see
that there's a difference

1073
00:44:22,828 --> 00:44:24,395
this time at all.

1074
00:44:24,429 --> 00:44:27,198
You know, I don't expect
anything from you.

1075
00:44:27,232 --> 00:44:27,966
Nothing.

1076
00:44:27,999 --> 00:44:29,134
- Shay, look, okay.

1077
00:44:29,167 --> 00:44:31,469
I know you've been
taking this hard, okay.

1078
00:44:31,502 --> 00:44:33,138
But I promise you, Shay.

1079
00:44:33,171 --> 00:44:36,374
Just give it a little more time.

1080
00:44:36,407 --> 00:44:38,777
- (scoffs) Time?

1081
00:44:38,810 --> 00:44:43,281
If I had time, but
I don't have time.

1082
00:44:43,314 --> 00:44:44,750
You know, I'm all timed out.

1083
00:44:44,783 --> 00:44:45,650
- Oh, you're timed out?

1084
00:44:45,683 --> 00:44:46,451
- Fresh out.

1085
00:44:46,484 --> 00:44:47,919
- Oh, you're fresh out?

1086
00:44:47,953 --> 00:44:50,155
No, I'm the one that's
fresh the fuck out, okay?

1087
00:44:50,188 --> 00:44:51,757
How about fresh out
of my pocket, huh?

1088
00:44:51,790 --> 00:44:54,059
How about fresh out of
kicking my ass everyday,

1089
00:44:54,092 --> 00:44:55,827
so you can just kick back, huh?

1090
00:44:55,861 --> 00:44:58,563
How about fresh out of I'm
tired of waiting on you

1091
00:44:58,596 --> 00:45:00,331
to stop waiting on me?

1092
00:45:00,365 --> 00:45:01,733
- It ain't about your money.

1093
00:45:01,767 --> 00:45:02,600
- Oh, it ain't about the money

1094
00:45:02,633 --> 00:45:04,535
- No, it's about me.

1095
00:45:05,470 --> 00:45:06,905
- Look here, Shay.

1096
00:45:06,938 --> 00:45:09,841
Don't do this to us.

1097
00:45:09,875 --> 00:45:11,542
Give us a chance, Shay.

1098
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,446
- You know, what?

1099
00:45:15,480 --> 00:45:18,183
I won't be at home tonight

1100
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,751
and you can pack your things

1101
00:45:19,785 --> 00:45:21,552
and leave.
- Shay.

1102
00:45:23,221 --> 00:45:24,022
Okay?

1103
00:45:26,524 --> 00:45:28,393
- Shay, I love you.

1104
00:45:33,398 --> 00:45:36,167
The worst thing they say
you gotta take is a lie.

1105
00:45:36,201 --> 00:45:39,537
And the kindest gesture
you gotta do just a lie.

1106
00:45:39,570 --> 00:45:42,040
- [Wesley] Mmm-hmm,
because you never know.

1107
00:45:42,073 --> 00:45:43,842
- That's right.

1108
00:45:43,875 --> 00:45:46,144
- Well, all I got
to do is keep still

1109
00:45:46,177 --> 00:45:47,813
and I got her on the go.

1110
00:45:47,846 --> 00:45:49,280
- [Chris] Nigga, women
are contrary, man.

1111
00:45:49,314 --> 00:45:51,049
Don't you know that?

1112
00:45:51,082 --> 00:45:53,218
You gotta treat a woman
like she's some dirt

1113
00:45:53,251 --> 00:45:56,387
in order for her to flower.

1114
00:45:56,421 --> 00:45:57,655
- What?

1115
00:45:57,688 --> 00:45:59,690
- Look at how
you've been acting.

1116
00:45:59,724 --> 00:46:02,160
I mean, what has it gotten you?

1117
00:46:02,193 --> 00:46:04,195
Everything you've been doing.

1118
00:46:04,229 --> 00:46:05,463
I mean, if you want
to get a woman,

1119
00:46:05,496 --> 00:46:07,198
you've gotta kick
them in the teeth

1120
00:46:07,232 --> 00:46:10,235
in order for them to
know how to feel good.

1121
00:46:10,268 --> 00:46:11,669
Then, say some shit like,

1122
00:46:11,702 --> 00:46:12,904
"Pick that shit up off the floor

1123
00:46:12,938 --> 00:46:15,340
"before it dirty the
rest of the house."

1124
00:46:15,373 --> 00:46:18,810
Adding a curse for good
measure in between compliments,

1125
00:46:18,844 --> 00:46:21,412
just to keep them off balance
so they don't know where to go

1126
00:46:21,446 --> 00:46:23,581
or who to turn to.

1127
00:46:23,614 --> 00:46:25,683
Everytime, I guarantee you,

1128
00:46:25,716 --> 00:46:28,920
they'll come running
back for more.

1129
00:46:28,954 --> 00:46:31,222
When they in front
of they family,

1130
00:46:31,256 --> 00:46:35,026
you gotta find fault
with everything with them

1131
00:46:35,060 --> 00:46:37,195
and I bet you that
they will defend you

1132
00:46:37,228 --> 00:46:40,231
to you, yours or anybody
else who has anything

1133
00:46:40,265 --> 00:46:41,632
to say against you.

1134
00:46:43,301 --> 00:46:44,870
And then we're you're
ready to go take care

1135
00:46:44,903 --> 00:46:46,404
of your night business,

1136
00:46:47,705 --> 00:46:49,307
you gotta be able to
look them in the eye

1137
00:46:51,276 --> 00:46:55,780
and smile and lie
to them dead on.

1138
00:46:57,215 --> 00:47:00,285
Until you can do that, your
woman ain't ever coming back.

1139
00:47:00,318 --> 00:47:03,288
- You weak, pathetic little man.

1140
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:05,156
Look you ain't any man.

1141
00:47:07,225 --> 00:47:12,230
(R&B music playing)

1142
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:14,432
- [Voiceover] I don't
wanna talk about it,

1143
00:47:14,465 --> 00:47:17,035
but I gotta talk about it.

1144
00:47:17,068 --> 00:47:18,603
And who else can I talk to,

1145
00:47:18,636 --> 00:47:20,605
when I can't talk to her?

1146
00:47:22,840 --> 00:47:25,810
Every time we speak, she
drops me to my knees.

1147
00:47:29,981 --> 00:47:32,217
- I've been missing you.

1148
00:47:32,250 --> 00:47:34,019
- Everything's gonna be alright.

1149
00:47:36,955 --> 00:47:40,091
- How do I know you won't
all let it get to me.

1150
00:47:40,125 --> 00:47:42,160
- Look in my eyes.

1151
00:47:42,193 --> 00:47:43,929
You wanna know the truth?

1152
00:47:45,363 --> 00:47:47,832
- Can you forgive me?

1153
00:47:47,865 --> 00:47:49,100
I wanna trust you.

1154
00:47:50,535 --> 00:47:52,770
What about retribution?

1155
00:47:52,803 --> 00:47:53,704
- That's all over.

1156
00:47:57,808 --> 00:47:59,978
- You know where
I was last week?

1157
00:48:00,011 --> 00:48:03,614
- What are they saying, my eyes?

1158
00:48:05,716 --> 00:48:08,453
- The convention in Monterey.

1159
00:48:08,486 --> 00:48:10,021
I thought of you the whole time.

1160
00:48:11,056 --> 00:48:12,323
- Answer me.

1161
00:48:16,294 --> 00:48:18,196
- You love me.

1162
00:48:18,229 --> 00:48:19,564
- What else?

1163
00:48:22,067 --> 00:48:23,168
- I wasn't alone.

1164
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,373
- Tell me. What else?

1165
00:48:28,406 --> 00:48:31,376
- What? I don't know, what?

1166
00:48:31,409 --> 00:48:32,810
- You know.

1167
00:48:32,843 --> 00:48:35,613
- I don't k now what
you're talking about.

1168
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,581
- I'm yours.

1169
00:48:41,486 --> 00:48:43,821
- I was with him.

1170
00:48:43,854 --> 00:48:45,523
It wasn't just a convention.

1171
00:48:51,829 --> 00:48:54,032
- You must think I'm a fool.

1172
00:48:54,065 --> 00:48:56,301
- I wanna be honest with you.

1173
00:48:56,334 --> 00:49:00,405
- No, you wanna see
me suffer, is all.

1174
00:49:00,438 --> 00:49:03,508
- I didn't want you
to find out later.

1175
00:49:03,541 --> 00:49:07,412
- You wanted to see
me when you said it.

1176
00:49:07,445 --> 00:49:10,948
- You enjoy it. You satisfied?

1177
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:15,053
- I won't be satisfied
until we're together.

1178
00:49:19,890 --> 00:49:21,559
- Be my wife.

1179
00:49:26,931 --> 00:49:28,933
- Go on and call her.

1180
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,401
See if she's at home right now.

1181
00:49:30,435 --> 00:49:32,537
Let's see if you've got
the courage for that.

1182
00:49:32,570 --> 00:49:34,605
- I'd be weak to call.

1183
00:49:34,639 --> 00:49:36,607
- [Chris] Don't give me that.

1184
00:49:36,641 --> 00:49:40,078
- Yeah, well, I called my
girl like that one time.

1185
00:49:40,111 --> 00:49:43,948
She picks up the
phone and she says,

1186
00:49:43,981 --> 00:49:46,784
(groaning)

1187
00:49:46,817 --> 00:49:50,055
(laughing)

1188
00:49:50,088 --> 00:49:51,789
Not right now.

1189
00:49:51,822 --> 00:49:53,391
Call me back.

1190
00:49:53,424 --> 00:49:55,126
Yeah, I sure the fuck did.

1191
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:56,994
(laughing)

1192
00:49:58,496 --> 00:50:00,465
- Look. look, look, look.

1193
00:50:00,498 --> 00:50:02,467
What's the difference
to phone, huh?

1194
00:50:02,500 --> 00:50:05,270
Anything she's doing is
regardless to all that shit.

1195
00:50:05,303 --> 00:50:06,437
- No, no, no.

1196
00:50:06,471 --> 00:50:09,640
The phone is a
reminding fact, man.

1197
00:50:09,674 --> 00:50:12,410
That used to be his
number that he's calling.

1198
00:50:13,611 --> 00:50:15,846
You know, that was
your phone number.

1199
00:50:17,182 --> 00:50:20,318
And somebody else is
probably calling right now.

1200
00:50:20,351 --> 00:50:21,819
- [Wesley] Chill on the brother.

1201
00:50:21,852 --> 00:50:23,288
Whatever he does, why don't
you just leave him alone.

1202
00:50:23,321 --> 00:50:24,722
- Hey, he can express his
views the same as you,

1203
00:50:24,755 --> 00:50:25,990
motherfucker.

1204
00:50:26,023 --> 00:50:27,258
- Why don't you just
stay out of this?

1205
00:50:27,292 --> 00:50:28,559
- What, now you're
threatening me?

1206
00:50:28,593 --> 00:50:30,461
Ain't this some shit.

1207
00:50:30,495 --> 00:50:33,464
Huh? What, you done mustered
up some balls somewhere?

1208
00:50:33,498 --> 00:50:35,733
- Look, I'm just
telling you, is all.

1209
00:50:35,766 --> 00:50:36,934
- You don't tell me shit.

1210
00:50:36,967 --> 00:50:37,635
- [Wesley] Well
then, tell everybody.

1211
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:39,270
- I'll tell you.

1212
00:50:39,304 --> 00:50:41,606
- Well, tell everybody
what the fuck you gonna do.

1213
00:50:41,639 --> 00:50:42,840
- What you trying to do, man?

1214
00:50:42,873 --> 00:50:44,842
What you turning the
other cheek today?

1215
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:45,843
- I'm not gonna do nothing.

1216
00:50:45,876 --> 00:50:47,345
What you gonna do?

1217
00:50:47,378 --> 00:50:48,846
- Don't think this martyrdom
shit is going to bring

1218
00:50:48,879 --> 00:50:50,681
this ass whooping to quit.

1219
00:50:50,715 --> 00:50:52,417
- [Wesley] Fuck you,
then do it, huh?

1220
00:50:52,450 --> 00:50:53,918
Do it, motherfucker.

1221
00:50:53,951 --> 00:50:58,789
- Nevermind your brazen
chest, or your puffed up chin,

1222
00:50:58,823 --> 00:51:00,057
or your courage.

1223
00:51:01,292 --> 00:51:05,029
All the rest. You
all die the same.

1224
00:51:06,297 --> 00:51:07,598
The worst that
you could imagine,

1225
00:51:07,632 --> 00:51:10,135
you have not imagined yet.

1226
00:51:10,168 --> 00:51:12,870
Defenses against rage,

1227
00:51:12,903 --> 00:51:14,739
that's a corpse's jest.

1228
00:51:16,741 --> 00:51:18,709
You look at me as easy prey.

1229
00:51:20,311 --> 00:51:22,847
I look at you and see
what I have yet to do.

1230
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:24,682
And don't bother to look.

1231
00:51:24,715 --> 00:51:27,152
You will see me again.

1232
00:51:27,185 --> 00:51:30,755
Gradually and by degrees
you will be destroyed.

1233
00:51:32,523 --> 00:51:36,794
I will wrench your heart
of its last drop of blood

1234
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:40,097
for harms that it
offered me in mourn.

1235
00:51:52,109 --> 00:51:53,978
(moaning)

1236
00:51:54,011 --> 00:51:59,016
(hip-hop music)

1237
00:52:01,619 --> 00:52:04,054
(grunting)

1238
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:07,258
- Yeah. (moaning)

1239
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,331
How long do you
expect me to wait?

1240
00:52:13,364 --> 00:52:18,369
(hip-hop music playing)

1241
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:12,323
- [Voiceover] The phone,
nothing but a curse.

1242
00:53:12,357 --> 00:53:14,625
Standing there.

1243
00:53:14,659 --> 00:53:17,395
See how it's taunting me?

1244
00:53:17,428 --> 00:53:22,433
I can't move, standing here
with my insides all choked out.

1245
00:53:24,702 --> 00:53:27,405
How come nobody told
me it was even possible

1246
00:53:27,438 --> 00:53:28,639
to feel this way?

1247
00:53:29,640 --> 00:53:31,476
Sam could take it.

1248
00:53:31,509 --> 00:53:33,744
Even Wesley.

1249
00:53:33,778 --> 00:53:37,114
So, what the hell's
wrong with me?

1250
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:39,183
I can't even look at my
friends knowing exactly

1251
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:40,351
what they see,

1252
00:53:40,385 --> 00:53:43,421
a sorry ass fool with
spit all over me.

1253
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,855
How could this happen?

1254
00:53:44,889 --> 00:53:47,057
Somebody explain
that shit to me.

1255
00:53:49,360 --> 00:53:51,329
She waylaid me,

1256
00:53:51,362 --> 00:53:53,197
while we were still together.

1257
00:53:53,230 --> 00:53:54,532
While we were still a couple,

1258
00:53:54,565 --> 00:53:56,767
she lay in waiting, storing up,

1259
00:53:56,801 --> 00:54:00,137
waiting for the day
when she would hit me.

1260
00:54:00,170 --> 00:54:03,040
I was still loving her.

1261
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,209
That's the part that gets me.

1262
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:07,612
We had stuff that was only us,

1263
00:54:07,645 --> 00:54:09,146
that nobody knew.

1264
00:54:09,179 --> 00:54:12,082
And that she could plan
this after all that.

1265
00:54:13,884 --> 00:54:14,652
Woo.

1266
00:54:16,253 --> 00:54:18,856
No wonder I'm so fucked up.

1267
00:54:18,889 --> 00:54:21,859
I'm scared to leave the
house in case she calls,

1268
00:54:21,892 --> 00:54:24,729
in case this once she'll listen,

1269
00:54:25,863 --> 00:54:30,868
in case my words
land just right.

1270
00:54:32,403 --> 00:54:35,039
"I love you." I want to say.

1271
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:42,012
"How are you?" is all I can.

1272
00:54:43,548 --> 00:54:45,583
- Daddy, where are you?

1273
00:54:45,616 --> 00:54:50,555
(R&B music playing)

1274
00:54:57,194 --> 00:54:58,763
(screaming)

1275
00:54:58,796 --> 00:55:02,232
(laughing)

1276
00:55:02,266 --> 00:55:05,269
- [Wesley] Yeah, that's
what I thought so, too.

1277
00:55:05,302 --> 00:55:07,905
- You lucky I don't bust a
cap off in your bitch ass.

1278
00:55:07,938 --> 00:55:09,907
- [Wesley] Fuck you, niggas.

1279
00:55:12,242 --> 00:55:13,444
- Alright, ya'll.

1280
00:55:13,478 --> 00:55:14,445
Quit hogging up the
opportunity to talk.

1281
00:55:14,479 --> 00:55:17,247
Give somebody else one.

1282
00:55:17,281 --> 00:55:18,983
- [Wesley] Samuel, I tell
you what happened to me?

1283
00:55:20,618 --> 00:55:21,719
Hmm?

1284
00:55:21,752 --> 00:55:22,753
White girl from
Switzerland, I tell you?

1285
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:23,688
- No.

1286
00:55:23,721 --> 00:55:25,055
- I ain't tell you this?

1287
00:55:25,089 --> 00:55:26,624
- No motherfucker.

1288
00:55:26,657 --> 00:55:28,025
- Well, no, no,
no what, what now?

1289
00:55:28,058 --> 00:55:30,127
Tell us, who now?

1290
00:55:30,160 --> 00:55:31,696
- Well you know Richelle
and I were planning on

1291
00:55:31,729 --> 00:55:33,698
getting back together for weeks.

1292
00:55:33,731 --> 00:55:36,200
So she finally let me know,

1293
00:55:36,233 --> 00:55:38,202
just because we
getting back together

1294
00:55:38,235 --> 00:55:41,105
don't mean she's
letting her new man go.

1295
00:55:42,306 --> 00:55:44,575
- Oh ain't that a
bitch. (laughing)

1296
00:55:44,609 --> 00:55:45,976
- She actually did that shit?

1297
00:55:46,010 --> 00:55:47,077
(laughing)

1298
00:55:47,111 --> 00:55:48,579
- That's criminal man.

1299
00:55:48,613 --> 00:55:50,314
- No, no, she has the
nerve to sit me down

1300
00:55:50,347 --> 00:55:52,983
to tell me what type
of nigga he was, damn.

1301
00:55:53,017 --> 00:55:54,318
- Oh, man.

1302
00:55:54,351 --> 00:55:56,253
- And yet, you know
I wish a woman would

1303
00:55:56,286 --> 00:55:58,288
do some shit like
that to me man.

1304
00:55:58,322 --> 00:56:00,425
Drop that bitch off a freeway.

1305
00:56:00,458 --> 00:56:01,926
(laughing)

1306
00:56:01,959 --> 00:56:03,961
- The other day, I told
baby I was going out with

1307
00:56:03,994 --> 00:56:05,663
somebody new even
though it wasn't true.

1308
00:56:05,696 --> 00:56:07,231
(laughing)

1309
00:56:07,264 --> 00:56:09,434
- Even though she
really is (laughing).

1310
00:56:09,467 --> 00:56:12,503
- Whoa! Uh oh. (laughing)

1311
00:56:13,538 --> 00:56:15,440
- You know what though?

1312
00:56:15,473 --> 00:56:18,609
Man, everything she do,
see it go through her mind.

1313
00:56:18,643 --> 00:56:21,779
'Cuz she got to wonder if
I'm doing the same thing too.

1314
00:56:21,812 --> 00:56:24,482
- Now I caught myself
getting back at this

1315
00:56:24,515 --> 00:56:26,817
one time girl I had
for what she did to me.

1316
00:56:28,018 --> 00:56:31,188
Swore on my grave that I
was gonna make her pay.

1317
00:56:32,322 --> 00:56:35,926
So I saved paycheck
after paycheck,

1318
00:56:35,960 --> 00:56:37,695
'til that final payday.

1319
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,196
- That's the Hawaii?

1320
00:56:39,229 --> 00:56:43,267
- Mmm-hmm, mmm-hmm, Hawaii,
the Waikiki, Kiki Palace.

1321
00:56:43,300 --> 00:56:45,570
Her favorite best place
in the whole wide world.

1322
00:56:47,037 --> 00:56:49,507
Now we had been split for a
while then, by then, right.

1323
00:56:49,540 --> 00:56:54,378
So when I gave her the
ticket, she says, "Fine".

1324
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:58,816
(laughs) Now, martinis,
dinner by the shore,

1325
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:01,486
the whole nine yards right.

1326
00:57:01,519 --> 00:57:04,755
But now it's time to go
back to the room, I'm tired.

1327
00:57:06,223 --> 00:57:07,525
We say our good night and
you know, see you later,

1328
00:57:07,558 --> 00:57:09,560
you know, the whole thing.

1329
00:57:09,594 --> 00:57:12,530
She go to her room,
I go to my room.

1330
00:57:12,563 --> 00:57:15,199
She close her door,
I close my door.

1331
00:57:15,232 --> 00:57:18,168
But oh, a brother didn't
have to wait long.

1332
00:57:18,202 --> 00:57:21,506
Mmm, 'cuz I was ready.

1333
00:57:21,539 --> 00:57:25,242
Here she come, tap,
tap (knocking).

1334
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:30,915
She comes in, and
butt naked, freestyle

1335
00:57:30,948 --> 00:57:34,284
on the floor with a hotel
call girl. (laughing)

1336
00:57:36,186 --> 00:57:39,056
The look on her face was
worth the ticket alone.

1337
00:57:39,089 --> 00:57:42,560
(exhales sharply)
but damn, a brother

1338
00:57:42,593 --> 00:57:45,029
had a high price
the next day to pay.

1339
00:57:45,062 --> 00:57:47,532
But from the racket
coming from her headboard

1340
00:57:47,565 --> 00:57:51,001
outta her room, that's
the full day's and more.

1341
00:57:51,035 --> 00:57:56,040
(laughing)

1342
00:57:57,407 --> 00:57:59,877
- Fuck that man, I'd a
been making noise even if I

1343
00:57:59,910 --> 00:58:03,548
had to pretend, doing some
shit like this, you know.

1344
00:58:03,581 --> 00:58:05,550
- Hell or got a different room.

1345
00:58:05,583 --> 00:58:06,784
- (chuckles) Something.

1346
00:58:06,817 --> 00:58:08,786
(laughing)

1347
00:58:10,454 --> 00:58:12,289
- Ah, when Shelia and
I was breaking up,

1348
00:58:12,322 --> 00:58:14,224
this motherfucker called
the house one day.

1349
00:58:15,392 --> 00:58:17,394
Tell me to get my punk
ass up and put that

1350
00:58:17,427 --> 00:58:19,429
bitch on the phone,
just like this, right.

1351
00:58:19,463 --> 00:58:20,364
- [Glenn} Damn.

1352
00:58:20,397 --> 00:58:21,599
- I say, "What?"

1353
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:23,133
He said, "Nigga, you
heard what I said.

1354
00:58:23,167 --> 00:58:25,570
"Put that bitch on the phone."

1355
00:58:25,603 --> 00:58:27,304
So I say, "The fuck is this?"

1356
00:58:27,337 --> 00:58:28,773
'Cuz I wanted to know, you know.

1357
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:31,208
The motherfucker said,
"Nigga, this is me Bobby D.

1358
00:58:31,241 --> 00:58:34,478
"B-O-B-B-Y D."

1359
00:58:34,511 --> 00:58:36,547
Huh, ain't that a bitch?

1360
00:58:36,581 --> 00:58:38,415
- [Glenn] Yeah you
know one of your girls

1361
00:58:38,448 --> 00:58:39,884
must have called her like that.

1362
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,251
- You want to know
where it came from?

1363
00:58:41,285 --> 00:58:42,920
That's where it came from.

1364
00:58:42,953 --> 00:58:45,623
- Yeah, you do some shit like
that you better be prepared.

1365
00:58:45,656 --> 00:58:47,224
- Yeah, 'cuz it's coming back.

1366
00:58:47,257 --> 00:58:48,626
- Hell yeah.
- Coming back.

1367
00:58:48,659 --> 00:58:49,627
- Please believe.

1368
00:58:49,660 --> 00:58:51,161
- (chuckles) You see, they mark

1369
00:58:51,195 --> 00:58:52,262
their territory with that phone.

1370
00:58:52,296 --> 00:58:57,301
(R&B music)

1371
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,103
- He don't want her back.

1372
00:58:59,136 --> 00:59:00,404
Look at her.

1373
00:59:00,437 --> 00:59:03,307
Everything he does is
the wrong thing to do.

1374
00:59:03,340 --> 00:59:06,711
He can't move in to embrace
her without her turning away.

1375
00:59:08,212 --> 00:59:12,316
And every time he goes to
hold her he just gonna let go.

1376
00:59:13,618 --> 00:59:17,688
Wow, okay, you can't
let your good girl

1377
00:59:17,722 --> 00:59:21,325
have everything she
wants all the time.

1378
00:59:22,727 --> 00:59:24,361
And every time he tells
you something different,

1379
00:59:24,394 --> 00:59:26,631
deep down, he lying.

1380
00:59:27,698 --> 00:59:28,933
(doorbell ringing)

1381
00:59:28,966 --> 00:59:31,568
- Hey come on, the door's open.

1382
00:59:38,175 --> 00:59:39,644
- Hey Samuel.

1383
00:59:39,677 --> 00:59:41,712
- Donna, hey how you doin'?

1384
00:59:41,746 --> 00:59:44,048
I didn't expect to see you here.

1385
00:59:44,081 --> 00:59:45,616
How's everything?

1386
00:59:45,650 --> 00:59:47,885
- Good, but you
know why I'm here?

1387
00:59:47,918 --> 00:59:50,888
- No, don't tell me,
let me guess, Wesley.

1388
00:59:50,921 --> 00:59:52,022
- Mmm.

1389
00:59:52,056 --> 00:59:53,557
- Come one in.

1390
00:59:53,590 --> 00:59:55,893
- (sighs) Samuel I
don't know what to do.

1391
00:59:55,926 --> 00:59:58,028
I've tried everything.

1392
00:59:58,062 --> 01:00:00,030
- Come on Donna, dude's a
fool for you and you know it.

1393
01:00:01,932 --> 01:00:04,134
- But nothing I say makes
any difference to him.

1394
01:00:04,168 --> 01:00:06,370
- Look, can I get you
something to drink?

1395
01:00:06,403 --> 01:00:08,238
Juice, soda, beer?

1396
01:00:08,272 --> 01:00:09,907
- Yes, thank you.

1397
01:00:11,375 --> 01:00:15,379
You're his friend, what can
I do to make him understand

1398
01:00:15,412 --> 01:00:16,847
that there's nothing
there for me?

1399
01:00:16,881 --> 01:00:19,416
- Oh that's funny, you
doing everything you can

1400
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,086
to make him understand
it's over, and he's

1401
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:26,223
doing everything to make you
understand that it's not.

1402
01:00:30,394 --> 01:00:32,763
- Yeah but you know you
have to realize something

1403
01:00:32,797 --> 01:00:35,099
it was never that serious.

1404
01:00:35,132 --> 01:00:38,168
- Just don't tell
him that, all right?

1405
01:00:38,202 --> 01:00:41,638
- Mmm-mmm. I want
you to tell him that.

1406
01:00:43,140 --> 01:00:47,111
You can tell him that I
only showed interest in him

1407
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:49,947
so that I could get to know you.

1408
01:00:49,980 --> 01:00:53,117
And how I bided
my time with him,

1409
01:00:53,150 --> 01:00:55,552
waiting for this
moment to be with you.

1410
01:00:55,585 --> 01:00:57,254
- Hey, wait, wait, wait,
wait, wait, wait a minute,

1411
01:00:57,287 --> 01:00:59,724
wait a minute, now I don't
know what you heard okay.

1412
01:00:59,757 --> 01:01:02,960
Shay and I got our problems,
but this ain't one of 'em.

1413
01:01:02,993 --> 01:01:05,796
- (scoffs) So what
are you saying? Hmm?

1414
01:01:07,497 --> 01:01:09,734
- What I'm saying--
- Mmm-hmm.

1415
01:01:11,836 --> 01:01:14,504
- What I'm, what
I'm saying is no.

1416
01:01:20,344 --> 01:01:24,915
- You bitch and stop
looking at my ass.

1417
01:01:24,949 --> 01:01:27,818
(R&B music)

1418
01:01:27,852 --> 01:01:30,120
- And she put him through
a whole lot of things.

1419
01:01:30,154 --> 01:01:31,856
That I can empathize with.

1420
01:01:33,323 --> 01:01:37,461
But there is one thing that
he's got to understand,

1421
01:01:38,963 --> 01:01:41,966
for some reason, he's not.

1422
01:01:45,002 --> 01:01:46,203
- I'm listening.

1423
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,774
- It's her pussy.

1424
01:01:49,807 --> 01:01:54,812
(R&B music playing)

1425
01:02:04,054 --> 01:02:07,391
- Oh my God, I forgot.

1426
01:02:08,325 --> 01:02:10,961
You were kissing
me and I forgot.

1427
01:02:10,995 --> 01:02:12,362
- What good is that?

1428
01:02:12,396 --> 01:02:13,663
- [Voiceover] Yeah he finally
got his shit on there,

1429
01:02:13,697 --> 01:02:16,433
a hickey. Okay that's some shit.

1430
01:02:16,466 --> 01:02:18,836
What is that?

1431
01:02:18,869 --> 01:02:19,770
- [Glenn] You bad.

1432
01:02:19,804 --> 01:02:21,038
- [Wesley] He's bad, whoa.

1433
01:02:21,071 --> 01:02:22,406
- [Chris] Oh, why
can't I play that?

1434
01:02:25,509 --> 01:02:29,479
- [Glenn] (mumbles)
shuff up, shuff up.

1435
01:02:29,513 --> 01:02:31,548
- [Voiceover] What
I'm saying is nothing.

1436
01:02:31,581 --> 01:02:35,252
- [Donna] You bitch,
stop looking at my ass.

1437
01:02:36,586 --> 01:02:38,088
He was there all right.

1438
01:02:39,156 --> 01:02:40,557
And somebody else too.

1439
01:02:40,590 --> 01:02:41,525
- What?

1440
01:02:41,558 --> 01:02:43,193
- [Woman] Oh, that's it, mmm.

1441
01:02:43,227 --> 01:02:44,895
Any making up he
thought was gonna go on,

1442
01:02:44,929 --> 01:02:46,330
he can forget it now.

1443
01:02:46,363 --> 01:02:47,865
- He was with another woman?

1444
01:02:47,898 --> 01:02:49,133
- Yep.

1445
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,400
- [woman] I thought
you all had plans?

1446
01:02:50,434 --> 01:02:51,635
- [leather jacket] Yeah,
he had plans all right.

1447
01:02:51,668 --> 01:02:54,038
He planned that shit
all the way there.

1448
01:02:54,071 --> 01:02:56,173
- [Woman] Oh wait
a minute, back up.

1449
01:02:56,206 --> 01:02:57,908
- That fucking puto.

1450
01:02:57,942 --> 01:02:58,843
- [leather jacket] Yeah right.

1451
01:02:58,876 --> 01:03:00,077
- [Woman] What?

1452
01:03:00,110 --> 01:03:01,645
- I'm so damned pissed
I don't know what to do.

1453
01:03:01,678 --> 01:03:04,514
- [leather jacket] You don't
do anything, that's what.

1454
01:03:04,548 --> 01:03:07,551
You don't call, you don't
return his phone calls.

1455
01:03:07,584 --> 01:03:09,253
And if you see him in
public, play it off

1456
01:03:09,286 --> 01:03:10,487
like you never even knew.

1457
01:03:10,520 --> 01:03:12,089
And if he wants to make plans,

1458
01:03:12,122 --> 01:03:14,091
let him make plans all day long.

1459
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,828
But you don't have
to follow through.

1460
01:03:17,862 --> 01:03:19,063
- Amen.

1461
01:03:19,096 --> 01:03:20,998
- Si, si, I did the same
thing to Lonnie Black.

1462
01:03:21,031 --> 01:03:24,001
Some type of fag, had
that punk meeting me

1463
01:03:24,034 --> 01:03:26,403
all over town, for
dinner, for drinks.

1464
01:03:26,436 --> 01:03:30,374
Each time I'd say, "Oh I
don't know what happened,

1465
01:03:30,407 --> 01:03:31,942
"but next time, I'm there."

1466
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:34,044
Mmm, puto right now
probably waiting

1467
01:03:34,078 --> 01:03:36,380
for me somewhere (laughing).

1468
01:03:38,615 --> 01:03:40,284
- Oh girl, you'll
be okay though.

1469
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,785
- What about it.

1470
01:03:41,818 --> 01:03:43,120
- [Waitress] Here we
go ladies, your drinks.

1471
01:03:43,153 --> 01:03:44,388
- Thank you.

1472
01:03:44,421 --> 01:03:45,856
- [Waitress] Like
these, ready to order?

1473
01:03:45,890 --> 01:03:48,458
- [Glenn] I wanna see,
'cuz I'm really close here.

1474
01:03:48,492 --> 01:03:49,894
- [Chris] Hey man
you just watch out.

1475
01:03:49,927 --> 01:03:50,694
- [Wesley] Go ahead and pass,
you know you wanna pass.

1476
01:03:50,727 --> 01:03:51,962
- [Chris] Man shut up.

1477
01:03:51,996 --> 01:03:54,364
- I'm a tell you what
the last time I did.

1478
01:03:54,398 --> 01:03:57,767
All right? That, it was
Father's day a matter of fact.

1479
01:03:57,801 --> 01:03:59,603
Now she invited me
over to her place

1480
01:03:59,636 --> 01:04:02,272
to spend the day
because of that, right.

1481
01:04:02,306 --> 01:04:03,974
But I was back with
my family, it felt

1482
01:04:04,008 --> 01:04:06,776
so good my defenses
was down, you know.

1483
01:04:06,810 --> 01:04:10,147
She started complimenting so
I started complimenting back.

1484
01:04:10,180 --> 01:04:11,615
You know what I'm saying?

1485
01:04:11,648 --> 01:04:13,650
'Cuz I could she wanted
me, it wasn't hard to tell.

1486
01:04:13,683 --> 01:04:16,153
But I insisted no, you know?

1487
01:04:16,186 --> 01:04:18,288
Well I stood my
ground there too.

1488
01:04:18,322 --> 01:04:20,424
I'm telling you it was all
I could do to hold back.

1489
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,326
- (grunts) You held back?

1490
01:04:22,359 --> 01:04:23,961
- Wait a minute, what
you mean, you held back?

1491
01:04:25,362 --> 01:04:27,597
- I held back. You know.

1492
01:04:27,631 --> 01:04:29,666
- [Chris] What you hold back?

1493
01:04:29,699 --> 01:04:34,638
- I didn't go as far as
I, you know, as I could.

1494
01:04:34,671 --> 01:04:36,106
(laughing)

1495
01:04:36,140 --> 01:04:37,474
- You didn't put in you mean.

1496
01:04:37,507 --> 01:04:39,509
- You got to understand
man, I wasn't

1497
01:04:39,543 --> 01:04:41,345
going back to that
feeling, you know,

1498
01:04:41,378 --> 01:04:44,614
being dismissed, but it was
all I could do to resist.

1499
01:04:44,648 --> 01:04:46,816
- So what'd you do?

1500
01:04:46,850 --> 01:04:50,520
- Kept his clothes
on. (laughing)

1501
01:04:50,554 --> 01:04:51,688
- Oh is that all?

1502
01:04:51,721 --> 01:04:53,190
(laughing)

1503
01:04:53,223 --> 01:04:55,359
You know what, I should of
expected that shit from you.

1504
01:04:55,392 --> 01:04:58,028
- But I did for a
while, but it was good.

1505
01:04:58,062 --> 01:04:59,863
But still I'm not going
back to that feeling,

1506
01:04:59,896 --> 01:05:02,166
for my decency's sake,
so I kept a shred.

1507
01:05:03,400 --> 01:05:04,734
- [Chris] So what did you do?

1508
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:07,771
- Because the minute
you go all the way

1509
01:05:07,804 --> 01:05:09,539
the power has shifted control.

1510
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:10,774
- And they know it too.

1511
01:05:10,807 --> 01:05:12,342
Sit back and smoke
a cigarette on you.

1512
01:05:12,376 --> 01:05:14,278
- Yeah that's just
what they will.

1513
01:05:14,311 --> 01:05:16,846
- Ah, and then by then,
she started to bed.

1514
01:05:16,880 --> 01:05:20,050
- This motherfucker,
you believe this shit?

1515
01:05:20,084 --> 01:05:23,187
- She did man but
my mind was made.

1516
01:05:23,220 --> 01:05:26,223
Look it's surprised
me I did what I did.

1517
01:05:26,256 --> 01:05:27,857
- Aw, what the hell did you do?

1518
01:05:27,891 --> 01:05:29,193
- [Wesley] Yeah, what the hell?

1519
01:05:29,226 --> 01:05:30,660
- I held back.

1520
01:05:30,694 --> 01:05:32,729
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1521
01:05:32,762 --> 01:05:34,031
You holdin' back now huh?

1522
01:05:34,064 --> 01:05:35,799
What else did you
hold back Glenn?

1523
01:05:35,832 --> 01:05:37,367
- Nigga you full of shit.

1524
01:05:37,401 --> 01:05:40,470
- You fuck somebody
or either you don't.

1525
01:05:40,504 --> 01:05:41,905
- Wait, wait, you
held back what?

1526
01:05:41,938 --> 01:05:43,740
- No, no, no, no, no, what
the fuck he got to hold back?

1527
01:05:43,773 --> 01:05:46,810
- Listen, did you put it in?

1528
01:05:46,843 --> 01:05:48,512
- Not all the way.

1529
01:05:48,545 --> 01:05:52,049
(laughing)

1530
01:05:52,082 --> 01:05:54,651
- That little piece
of shit you got?

1531
01:05:54,684 --> 01:05:56,553
The moment you put
that motherfucker in

1532
01:05:56,586 --> 01:05:58,422
you go straight to the back.

1533
01:05:58,455 --> 01:06:01,491
- I didn't put it
in, not really.

1534
01:06:01,525 --> 01:06:03,593
- Oh please you a
God-damned liar.

1535
01:06:03,627 --> 01:06:07,564
- (chuckles) How did you
do it? What'd you do?

1536
01:06:07,597 --> 01:06:10,534
- What? I kept my
underwear on, all right?

1537
01:06:10,567 --> 01:06:12,602
Now how you like that?

1538
01:06:12,636 --> 01:06:14,871
Didn't take it out, I refused.

1539
01:06:14,904 --> 01:06:17,374
And she came two
times like that.

1540
01:06:17,407 --> 01:06:21,278
- Fuck you man, that,
that, that, what was that?

1541
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:24,914
Father's day right?
That was two months ago.

1542
01:06:24,948 --> 01:06:26,950
- [Voiceover] But
this dude's crazy.

1543
01:06:26,983 --> 01:06:29,486
Some people you can
talk to, but him,

1544
01:06:30,420 --> 01:06:32,389
he's never gonna change.

1545
01:06:32,422 --> 01:06:33,790
- [Glenn] You scared
that's all, you scared.

1546
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,425
- I'm sorry you
want to sit down?

1547
01:06:35,459 --> 01:06:36,726
- [Woman] Oh no I'm fine.

1548
01:06:36,760 --> 01:06:38,795
- Oh, oh, you gotta
excuse my manners,

1549
01:06:38,828 --> 01:06:40,264
I ain't see you, you know.

1550
01:06:40,297 --> 01:06:41,631
- No really I wouldn't
want to trouble you.

1551
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:43,400
- Baby ain't no trouble at all.

1552
01:06:43,433 --> 01:06:47,437
Actually, you know, you
can, you can share it.

1553
01:06:48,638 --> 01:06:50,040
- How?

1554
01:06:50,074 --> 01:06:52,176
- You can sit on my lap.

1555
01:06:54,078 --> 01:06:56,046
Come on baby I'm just
trying to be polite.

1556
01:06:56,080 --> 01:06:57,947
- No that was so disrespectful.

1557
01:06:57,981 --> 01:06:59,316
- Wait, wait, how is
that disrespectful?

1558
01:06:59,349 --> 01:07:00,817
All I asked, I just
posed the question.

1559
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:02,152
- You just being
rude and indecent.

1560
01:07:02,186 --> 01:07:04,821
- No, hypothetically,
that's what, you know,

1561
01:07:04,854 --> 01:07:07,624
if I did something it'd be
different, I ain't do shit.

1562
01:07:07,657 --> 01:07:09,259
- Mmm-mmm, you know
what, you're just

1563
01:07:09,293 --> 01:07:10,660
a sorry excuse for a gentleman.

1564
01:07:11,795 --> 01:07:14,631
- You know what, take
the fucking seat.

1565
01:07:14,664 --> 01:07:16,900
Yeah, can't even make fun
of, and fucking eating too.

1566
01:07:16,933 --> 01:07:18,268
Shit, sit your ass down.

1567
01:07:18,302 --> 01:07:19,769
- [Wesley] I like that shit.

1568
01:07:19,803 --> 01:07:21,538
- All right gimme this,
gimme something, fuck it.

1569
01:07:22,706 --> 01:07:25,342
Man, fuck that, bitches
man, I'm telling you.

1570
01:07:25,375 --> 01:07:28,845
It's, man hell no, you
ain't never gonna catch

1571
01:07:28,878 --> 01:07:31,014
me being punked out by some hoe.

1572
01:07:31,047 --> 01:07:32,949
You know what I do to a hoe?

1573
01:07:32,982 --> 01:07:35,119
This what I did to this
one bitch one time.

1574
01:07:36,386 --> 01:07:38,855
I took this hoe for everything
she had in her crib.

1575
01:07:38,888 --> 01:07:42,626
Everything. I left only
two things for her.

1576
01:07:44,228 --> 01:07:48,698
A toothbrush and a roll of film.

1577
01:07:48,732 --> 01:07:52,269
Her toothbrush, you
know, you know what

1578
01:07:52,302 --> 01:07:54,171
she saw when she developed
that roll of film?

1579
01:07:54,204 --> 01:07:55,805
- Mmm?

1580
01:07:55,839 --> 01:07:58,308
- Her toothbrush sticking
straight out my black ass.

1581
01:07:58,342 --> 01:08:03,347
(laughing)

1582
01:08:04,481 --> 01:08:06,316
- But man, you
made that shit up.

1583
01:08:06,350 --> 01:08:07,884
- No it takes a
sick motherfucker to

1584
01:08:07,917 --> 01:08:10,120
think of some shit
like that (laughing).

1585
01:08:10,154 --> 01:08:14,023
- (laughing) Whoever thought
of it, I take off my hat.

1586
01:08:14,057 --> 01:08:15,459
- And you made that up.

1587
01:08:15,492 --> 01:08:17,627
- Yeah you're right,
that's some bullshit.

1588
01:08:17,661 --> 01:08:19,729
That's like that
Father's day shit man.

1589
01:08:19,763 --> 01:08:22,199
I think that's
some bullshit too.

1590
01:08:22,232 --> 01:08:24,468
Who gonna let you fuck
'em with your drawers on?

1591
01:08:24,501 --> 01:08:25,702
- Come on man, what

1592
01:08:25,735 --> 01:08:26,903
you trying to do?
- [Glenn] What?

1593
01:08:26,936 --> 01:08:28,071
- Well I'm just
saying, you know,

1594
01:08:28,104 --> 01:08:29,573
you need to get a
motherfucking ass grip.

1595
01:08:29,606 --> 01:08:33,210
- Listen, everything she's
done to me is not what I do.

1596
01:08:33,243 --> 01:08:34,978
When she don't know
where to find me,

1597
01:08:35,011 --> 01:08:37,914
now she has to imagine
all the lurid details.

1598
01:08:37,947 --> 01:08:40,083
- Yeah, she ain't gotta
imagine a damn thing

1599
01:08:40,116 --> 01:08:42,386
all she gotta do is look at
them mirrors on the ceiling.

1600
01:08:42,419 --> 01:08:45,355
- Mmm-hmm but look out that
she don't catch your game.

1601
01:08:45,389 --> 01:08:48,692
- No shit, better
cuddle up real tight.

1602
01:08:48,725 --> 01:08:50,760
- Keep it all outta
sight 'cuz there won't

1603
01:08:50,794 --> 01:08:52,696
be no getting her
back if she knew.

1604
01:08:52,729 --> 01:08:54,097
- She might already do.

1605
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,899
- [Samuel] You have
to make her a sex tape

1606
01:08:55,932 --> 01:08:57,401
or something for her to believe.

1607
01:08:58,568 --> 01:09:01,238
- Man, shit, you want
everybody to believe

1608
01:09:01,271 --> 01:09:05,041
that you so confident
and high man,

1609
01:09:05,074 --> 01:09:06,109
but I know better baby.

1610
01:09:06,142 --> 01:09:07,944
- How do you know anything?

1611
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:10,079
- Shit, just looking
at you I can see.

1612
01:09:10,113 --> 01:09:11,548
- Oh, what is the
problem with you?

1613
01:09:11,581 --> 01:09:12,616
- Oh well, well pick
you the phone man,

1614
01:09:12,649 --> 01:09:13,783
nevermind what I said.

1615
01:09:13,817 --> 01:09:15,519
- I ain't got to
pick up a damn thing.

1616
01:09:15,552 --> 01:09:16,953
- No, pick up the
phone, let's see.

1617
01:09:19,155 --> 01:09:21,124
- No, 'cuz I knew
you were scared.

1618
01:09:21,157 --> 01:09:22,091
- Why should he be?

1619
01:09:22,125 --> 01:09:23,193
- Who said he was scared?

1620
01:09:23,227 --> 01:09:24,093
- I said it, me.

1621
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:27,631
You know you want to,
pick up the phone.

1622
01:09:27,664 --> 01:09:28,832
- Why don't you just
chill out on the brother?

1623
01:09:30,300 --> 01:09:33,737
- Talking about how bad he
is, well, let's see then.

1624
01:09:33,770 --> 01:09:35,972
- Scared of what?
Why should he be?

1625
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:39,809
- He quaking in his
boots, scared to death.

1626
01:09:39,843 --> 01:09:42,646
Scared that she
might not be home.

1627
01:09:42,679 --> 01:09:46,149
Or that she might be home
but be a little busy.

1628
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:50,654
- Yeah well what fucking
difference does it make you?

1629
01:09:50,687 --> 01:09:52,656
- Just scared of the
truth, that's all.

1630
01:09:52,689 --> 01:09:54,291
- I don't see the
big fucking deal.

1631
01:09:54,324 --> 01:09:56,293
- (chuckles) He can't do it.

1632
01:09:56,326 --> 01:09:57,727
- Yeah that's
character, something

1633
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:59,796
you don't know shit about.

1634
01:09:59,829 --> 01:10:02,399
- No a weak character,
that's what he is.

1635
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:04,334
- Yeah motherfucker,
I said chill.

1636
01:10:04,368 --> 01:10:05,602
I mean what is it
you trying to prove?

1637
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,272
- What am I? What are you?

1638
01:10:08,305 --> 01:10:12,008
What you trying to prove
how big and bad he is?

1639
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,343
- Come on, enough of that shit.

1640
01:10:13,377 --> 01:10:14,444
- No fuck you.

1641
01:10:14,478 --> 01:10:15,512
- No fuck you.

1642
01:10:15,545 --> 01:10:17,781
- No fuck you
motherfucker, for real.

1643
01:10:17,814 --> 01:10:19,849
- Well I beat the
living shit outta you.

1644
01:10:19,883 --> 01:10:22,686
- Hey, don't do something
you gonna be sorry for.

1645
01:10:22,719 --> 01:10:23,853
- Yeah well I ain't like you,

1646
01:10:23,887 --> 01:10:25,255
I ain't just talking,
I'll do it too.

1647
01:10:25,289 --> 01:10:28,124
- Ain't nobody gonna
do nothing to nobody.

1648
01:10:29,559 --> 01:10:31,027
- Yeah, ain't nobody talking
to you, you little bitch.

1649
01:10:31,060 --> 01:10:32,596
- You pussy motherfucker,
I'm talking to you.

1650
01:10:32,629 --> 01:10:35,365
- Whatever Chris
said, man shut up.

1651
01:10:37,233 --> 01:10:38,868
I was thinking about
something else.

1652
01:10:38,902 --> 01:10:40,203
- Nah, I'm just
tired of his shit.

1653
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,806
- Look, forget it.

1654
01:10:42,839 --> 01:10:43,873
- No, no man, fuck that.

1655
01:10:43,907 --> 01:10:45,475
- You threatening? (chuckles)

1656
01:10:45,509 --> 01:10:46,610
- I am, all right?

1657
01:10:46,643 --> 01:10:48,211
I'm scared man, is that what you

1658
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:49,779
motherfuckers wanted to hear?

1659
01:10:49,813 --> 01:10:51,180
- What I tell you?

1660
01:10:51,214 --> 01:10:52,882
- I'll give him
something to be scared.

1661
01:10:52,916 --> 01:10:55,385
That's the only reason
I want to kick his ass.

1662
01:10:55,419 --> 01:10:58,221
- God! God! God!

1663
01:10:58,254 --> 01:11:00,390
- There ain't no use
to feeling scared now.

1664
01:11:00,424 --> 01:11:02,526
Whether she comes back
or not ain't up to you.

1665
01:11:02,559 --> 01:11:04,294
Regardless to what you think.

1666
01:11:04,328 --> 01:11:05,762
- No it isn't.

1667
01:11:07,063 --> 01:11:08,565
But I just can't stop.

1668
01:11:08,598 --> 01:11:12,402
- Besides, she already told
you, if you was listening.

1669
01:11:12,436 --> 01:11:14,137
She said never right?

1670
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:15,372
- Well that's what she said.

1671
01:11:15,405 --> 01:11:16,239
- Well man, no it's
not necessarily true.

1672
01:11:16,272 --> 01:11:19,776
- Never again, never.

1673
01:11:21,378 --> 01:11:23,480
You think she crying and sad?

1674
01:11:23,513 --> 01:11:25,749
Shit, she laughing at you.

1675
01:11:25,782 --> 01:11:27,551
- It doesn't mean
anything man, nothing.

1676
01:11:27,584 --> 01:11:29,419
- Except it does to me.

1677
01:11:29,453 --> 01:11:30,887
- She's shitting all over you.

1678
01:11:30,920 --> 01:11:32,589
- Every chance she get.

1679
01:11:32,622 --> 01:11:34,190
- So how's that for you?

1680
01:11:34,223 --> 01:11:35,759
- You think she
really give a shit?

1681
01:11:35,792 --> 01:11:38,061
- She don't give a fuck.

1682
01:11:38,094 --> 01:11:41,698
- (laughing) If she
was coming back man,

1683
01:11:41,731 --> 01:11:43,600
ask yourself, would she do that?

1684
01:11:43,633 --> 01:11:44,901
- Everything she does,

1685
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:49,573
goes out of her
way to make me mad.

1686
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:52,776
- She'll be around long
enough to get tired,

1687
01:11:52,809 --> 01:11:55,445
tired of finally
kicking your ass.

1688
01:11:55,479 --> 01:11:59,383
- Then it's gonna be
goodbye for real, you know.

1689
01:11:59,416 --> 01:12:04,253
Start waving bye-bye now
'cuz you might as well.

1690
01:12:04,287 --> 01:12:06,856
- You just might as well.

1691
01:12:06,890 --> 01:12:09,693
- You think she
losing sleep man?

1692
01:12:09,726 --> 01:12:12,195
She having the time
of her fucking life.

1693
01:12:12,228 --> 01:12:15,298
Man she tossing and turning
but not from crying.

1694
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:16,800
- It's killing me.

1695
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,802
- [Wesley] You just about
have died my brother.

1696
01:12:18,835 --> 01:12:20,804
- Feels like I have.

1697
01:12:20,837 --> 01:12:23,573
- Yeah she's sleeping
good right now.

1698
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:26,643
And waking up justly
tired (laughing).

1699
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:29,245
- See you gonna make
me do something to you.

1700
01:12:30,414 --> 01:12:32,248
- It's just when I felt
like was over it man,

1701
01:12:32,281 --> 01:12:33,783
I'm right back to where I am.

1702
01:12:33,817 --> 01:12:35,118
- You in hell.

1703
01:12:35,151 --> 01:12:37,621
- You put your ass there.

1704
01:12:38,655 --> 01:12:40,223
- She the devil, that girl, man.

1705
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:42,826
- I am trying to tell you.

1706
01:12:42,859 --> 01:12:44,661
- I just wanna die.

1707
01:12:44,694 --> 01:12:47,464

01:12:59,208 --> 01:13:01,845
- No, no, no, no, that's

01:14:09,846 --> 01:14:13,216
- Mama? Is that my mama?

1744
01:14:13,249 --> 01:14:14,484
- [Samuel] No, look

1745
01:14:14,518 --> 01:14:16,185
Now she says she

- Talk to her.

- Just leave me

1753
01:14:30,900 --> 01:14:32,235
(pounding)

1754
01:14:35,271 --> 01:14:37,807
(Wesley sobbing)

1755
01:14:39,943 --> 01:14:41,611
I love her man.

1756
01:14:41,645 --> 01:14:46,282
Why? Why she have to leave?

1757
01:14:48,652 --> 01:14:52,188
Come on man, I mean

1758
01:14:52,221 --> 01:14:56,259

01:14:57,661 --> 01:15:00,564
I mean, come on man, I'm not

1760
01:15:01,765 --> 01:15:03,767
Sam you know I wouln't

1761
01:15:03,800 --> 01:15:06,269
You know that man.

1764
01:15:11,975 --> 01:15:16,980
(sobbing)

1765
01:15:18,347 --> 01:15:22,251
The bitch could have waited
man, shit (sniffles).

1766
01:15:26,623 --> 01:15:31,360
Man, I mean the bitch
could've waited man.

1767
01:15:33,763 --> 01:15:36,600
She could've waited man.

1768
01:15:36,633 --> 01:15:41,638
She could've waited
man (sobbing).

1769
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:52,882
- Cuss her out for me.

1770
01:15:54,383 --> 01:15:56,485
- All right fool, oh
you gonna regret it.

1771
01:15:56,519 --> 01:15:58,287
- You don't, I will.

1772
01:16:00,056 --> 01:16:01,958
- Are you sure, you sure?

1773
01:16:01,991 --> 01:16:03,660
- No I can't help it
anymore, all right.

1774
01:16:03,693 --> 01:16:05,695
- Good, it's about time.

1775
01:16:05,729 --> 01:16:10,734
- (chuckles) Does she
got you man, she got you.

1776
01:16:11,500 --> 01:16:13,703
Don't you see it?

1777
01:16:13,737 --> 01:16:15,839
- I'm gonna find out right now.

1778
01:16:15,872 --> 01:16:17,040
- Come on man, don't I said.

1779
01:16:17,073 --> 01:16:19,108
- Look motherfucker, let
me tell you something,

1780
01:16:19,142 --> 01:16:20,644
it's my phone.

1781
01:16:20,677 --> 01:16:21,878
- All right, all right, all
right, stupid motherfucker.

1782
01:16:21,911 --> 01:16:23,212
- You don't want to
call somebody get

1783
01:16:23,246 --> 01:16:25,014
your own phone and
don't call 'em.

1784
01:16:25,048 --> 01:16:26,515
- From now on,
don't ask me shit.

1785
01:16:26,549 --> 01:16:29,052
- Ugh, to hell with your advice.

1786
01:16:29,085 --> 01:16:31,655
What did it any good?
Huh, your advice?

1787
01:16:31,688 --> 01:16:33,222
- Look I'm just
telling you, don't.

1788
01:16:34,523 --> 01:16:35,992
- To hell with your advice man.

1789
01:16:36,025 --> 01:16:37,661
- [Samuel] That's right,
show her who the man is.

1790
01:16:40,529 --> 01:16:41,798
- You know what?

1791
01:16:41,831 --> 01:16:44,067
You don't tell me man.

1792
01:16:44,100 --> 01:16:46,970
Go to hell, every last
fucking one of y'all,

1793
01:16:47,003 --> 01:16:48,638
just go to hell, all right.

1794
01:16:48,672 --> 01:16:50,573
That's all I got to say.

1795
01:16:50,606 --> 01:16:55,611
(phone beeping)

1796
01:17:02,251 --> 01:17:03,419
- You gonna pay.

1797
01:17:03,452 --> 01:17:04,654
- Yeah that's what you say.

1798
01:17:04,688 --> 01:17:05,922
- No no, that's
what you gonna do.

1799
01:17:05,955 --> 01:17:07,523
- Man we're gonna see
about that ain't we?

1800
01:17:07,556 --> 01:17:08,925
- Oh we ain't gonna
see about a damn thing.

1801
01:17:08,958 --> 01:17:10,694
It's gonna happen you know.

1802
01:17:10,727 --> 01:17:12,195
- Hey look, shut the
fuck up so I can hear.

1803
01:17:12,228 --> 01:17:14,097
- So shut the fuck up.

1804
01:17:14,130 --> 01:17:19,135
(R&B music playing)

1805
01:18:44,353 --> 01:18:47,090
- Something told me something.

1806
01:18:47,123 --> 01:18:51,594
That I should wait for
some kind of kind sign.

1807
01:18:51,627 --> 01:18:54,197
And that was what that was,

1808
01:18:54,230 --> 01:18:57,000
a divine presence in the
form of the worst kind.

1809
01:18:57,033 --> 01:18:59,535
- You feel better
now, don't you?

1810
01:18:59,568 --> 01:19:01,370
- A lot better.

1811
01:19:01,404 --> 01:19:02,605
- Well?

1812
01:19:02,638 --> 01:19:03,807
- Well what?

1813
01:19:03,840 --> 01:19:05,541
- You know damn well what.

1814
01:19:05,574 --> 01:19:06,642
- [Wesley] Come on
man, you're not gonna

1815
01:19:06,675 --> 01:19:08,111
tell us what she said?

1816
01:19:08,144 --> 01:19:10,713
- (sighs) It don't matter, I
got her right where I want her.

1817
01:19:10,746 --> 01:19:12,648
She mine anyway.

1818
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:14,650
- What the hell?

1819
01:19:14,683 --> 01:19:18,354
- Anywhere she move,
she move into view.

1820
01:19:18,387 --> 01:19:20,123
- Yeah that's some bullshit too.

1821
01:19:20,156 --> 01:19:22,125
- Look man, what
did she say to you?

1822
01:19:22,158 --> 01:19:26,695
- No, no, no, no, no, no,
you can't believe this

1823
01:19:26,729 --> 01:19:28,431
motherfucker, the way he lies.

1824
01:19:29,698 --> 01:19:31,567
- Why should I lie? For who?

1825
01:19:31,600 --> 01:19:33,469
- Look, you gonna
tell us or not?

1826
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:35,571
- It kicking your
ass, nigga, you just a

1827
01:19:35,604 --> 01:19:38,842
cream puff, a big fucking fake.

1828
01:19:38,875 --> 01:19:41,677
- You ain't shit and that's why.

1829
01:19:41,710 --> 01:19:43,646
- See, that was your last time.

1830
01:19:43,679 --> 01:19:44,914
- Forget it.

1831
01:19:44,948 --> 01:19:46,149
- No, no, no man,
I'm tired of him.

1832
01:19:46,182 --> 01:19:47,750
All he got else
to say is goodbye.

1833
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:50,086
- Leave the
motherfucker alone man.

1834
01:19:50,119 --> 01:19:51,354
What can he do?

1835
01:19:51,387 --> 01:19:52,922
- Oh no, he heard me
but he had to just

1836
01:19:52,956 --> 01:19:54,157
keep on like he didn't.

1837
01:19:54,190 --> 01:19:56,359
When you gonna learn
you don't disrespect me?

1838
01:19:56,392 --> 01:19:58,261
- Hey kiss my ass motherfucker.

1839
01:19:58,294 --> 01:19:59,863
I'm really getting tired
of this motherfucker.

1840
01:19:59,896 --> 01:20:02,832
- It ain't gonna be no
next time, this time.

1841
01:20:02,866 --> 01:20:07,036
- She said for me to meet
her tomorrow for sex.

1842
01:20:07,070 --> 01:20:09,172
If I had the time.

1843
01:20:09,205 --> 01:20:12,441
(laughing)

1844
01:20:12,475 --> 01:20:15,278
- You expect us to
believe that shit?

1845
01:20:15,311 --> 01:20:17,613
- It don't matter, I
ain't going either way.

1846
01:20:17,646 --> 01:20:19,415
- Did she really say that man?

1847
01:20:19,448 --> 01:20:22,852
- It's not the first time,
she trying to play me.

1848
01:20:22,886 --> 01:20:25,388
(chuckles) But I
just cut the line.

1849
01:20:25,421 --> 01:20:28,291
I got her now to where she
can't move, check mate.

1850
01:20:28,324 --> 01:20:29,959
- [Wesley] Yeah you
got to check your mate.

1851
01:20:29,993 --> 01:20:32,428
- [Chris] That's
what you got to do.

1852
01:20:32,461 --> 01:20:34,697
- Every time.

1853
01:20:34,730 --> 01:20:37,934
- Congratulations
baby, you got all these

1854
01:20:37,967 --> 01:20:41,170
stupid motherfuckers fooled
but not me you don't.

1855
01:20:43,839 --> 01:20:46,142
- She said she was
gonna get married.

1856
01:20:46,175 --> 01:20:47,443
- Married?

1857
01:20:47,476 --> 01:20:49,712
- My wife is getting married.

1858
01:20:49,745 --> 01:20:51,314
- She ain't your wife.

1859
01:20:51,347 --> 01:20:52,949
- Married to who?

1860
01:20:52,982 --> 01:20:54,317
- You did ask, didn't you?

1861
01:20:54,350 --> 01:20:56,052
- No, I didn't.

1862
01:20:56,085 --> 01:20:57,786
- Shit, that's what
you should have.

1863
01:20:57,820 --> 01:21:01,224
- She getting married,
don't you understand that?

1864
01:21:01,257 --> 01:21:03,927
That's everyday fucking
on a regular basis.

1865
01:21:03,960 --> 01:21:07,596
- Look, who is it man?

1866
01:21:07,630 --> 01:21:10,099
- It is isn't it, the same man?

1867
01:21:10,133 --> 01:21:12,001
- Who doesn't matter.

1868
01:21:12,035 --> 01:21:13,669
- Don't let that
happen to you man.

1869
01:21:13,702 --> 01:21:17,306
Marriage? Kick that
motherfucker's ass
just for the idea.

1870
01:21:17,340 --> 01:21:20,343
- Fuck being caution,
now ain't the time.

1871
01:21:20,376 --> 01:21:22,611
- Look, nothing is all I can do.

1872
01:21:22,645 --> 01:21:24,247
- No, nothing hell.

1873
01:21:24,280 --> 01:21:26,082
- What can he but cry?

1874
01:21:26,115 --> 01:21:28,751
- Send that motherfucker to
hell, that's what you need to.

1875
01:21:28,784 --> 01:21:32,321
- Break down baby, cry,
you know you want to.

1876
01:21:32,355 --> 01:21:36,425
- 'Cuz I'll be damned,
everybody gonna die.

1877
01:21:36,459 --> 01:21:40,196
- Strong motherfucker,
just look at you know.

1878
01:21:40,229 --> 01:21:43,366
Simple ass pussy, you
are weak and you're fake.

1879
01:21:43,399 --> 01:21:48,104
- I impart this small seed
to yield a field of hate.

1880
01:21:48,137 --> 01:21:52,108
That with vines of contempt
will choke off her mate.

1881
01:21:52,141 --> 01:21:56,479
Everything I would do,
she will now herself.

1882
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:03,386
At last your last grand stroke
against me, tell her from me,

1883
01:22:05,254 --> 01:22:08,057
you played yourself.

1884
01:22:08,091 --> 01:22:11,094
- Man that's a final
ass whooping you
know you can't take.

1885
01:22:12,428 --> 01:22:16,032
- I will marry her
never, tell her that now.

1886
01:22:16,065 --> 01:22:18,067
I've been pushed to
indifference that I

1887
01:22:18,101 --> 01:22:20,836
will go out of my
way to express.

1888
01:22:20,869 --> 01:22:25,874
She can do anything to
anyone anytime anywhere.

1889
01:22:26,609 --> 01:22:28,244
She's outta my life.

1890
01:22:28,277 --> 01:22:31,247
- Look, marriage is nothing,
it don't mean a thing.

1891
01:22:31,280 --> 01:22:33,849
- You lost motherfucker.

1892
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,219
Nigga you lose.

1893
01:22:36,252 --> 01:22:41,257
- All my best, this
is my now solemn wish.

1894
01:22:42,391 --> 01:22:43,926
- What you should've
asked was who.

1895
01:22:43,959 --> 01:22:48,197
- No, no, no, no, no, he
ain't ready for that baby.

1896
01:22:48,231 --> 01:22:50,099
- No you wrong about that.

1897
01:22:50,133 --> 01:22:52,868
- Yeah, well if he
was he would've asked.

1898
01:22:52,901 --> 01:22:54,737
- [Wesley] He can take
anything, he just don't know it.

1899
01:22:54,770 --> 01:22:56,272
- [Chris] Nah he
can't take this one.

1900
01:22:56,305 --> 01:22:57,706
He can't take it,
I'm telling you.

1901
01:22:57,740 --> 01:22:59,275
- What makes you think so, huh?

1902
01:22:59,308 --> 01:23:01,544
You know there's
nothing I hate more

1903
01:23:01,577 --> 01:23:04,947
than a weak ass, punk
ass, punk like you.

1904
01:23:04,980 --> 01:23:06,949
- Nigga I will kick
your hypocrit ass.

1905
01:23:06,982 --> 01:23:09,752
- Fuck you, I still
have a wife nigga.

1906
01:23:09,785 --> 01:23:11,354
(grunting)

1907
01:23:11,387 --> 01:23:14,390
Oh, get off, get off.

1908
01:23:15,991 --> 01:23:17,860
- Hey, hey, grab that
motherfucker, grab him.

1909
01:23:17,893 --> 01:23:20,129
- Get off me (mumbles)
brother get off me.

1910
01:23:20,163 --> 01:23:21,530
- Fuck you motherfucker.

1911
01:23:21,564 --> 01:23:22,431
- Don't ever touch me.

1912
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:23,099
- No man.

1913
01:23:23,132 --> 01:23:24,033
(thudding punch)

1914
01:23:24,067 --> 01:23:24,800
- Do that, let me get this.

1915
01:23:24,833 --> 01:23:25,701
- Be a fucking nigga..

1916
01:23:25,734 --> 01:23:26,402
- What the?

1917
01:23:26,435 --> 01:23:27,203
(thudding punch)

1918
01:23:27,236 --> 01:23:28,371
(punching)

1919
01:23:28,404 --> 01:23:30,806
- Glenn, no, Glenn,
Glenn, Glenn.

1920
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:31,607
- [Chris] Get him off me.

1921
01:23:31,640 --> 01:23:32,808
This ain't over man.

1922
01:23:32,841 --> 01:23:34,810
- [Samuel] Fuck, come on.

1923
01:23:34,843 --> 01:23:36,945
- [Glenn] Chris, I'm sorry man.

1924
01:23:36,979 --> 01:23:37,946
- [Chris] Fuck off.

1925
01:23:37,980 --> 01:23:39,448
- [Glenn] I'm sorry.

1926
01:23:39,482 --> 01:23:41,484
I just snapped man, I'm
sorry man, I just snapped.

1927
01:23:41,517 --> 01:23:43,486
- Yeah you damn
right you snapped.

1928
01:23:43,519 --> 01:23:45,821
But I got something
that'll snap for your ass.

1929
01:23:45,854 --> 01:23:47,290
- Well you ought to be
thanking this motherfucker

1930
01:23:47,323 --> 01:23:48,824
that I didn't kick your ass.

1931
01:23:48,857 --> 01:23:50,226
- All this shit over a phone?

1932
01:23:50,259 --> 01:23:52,995
What all did she say to you man?

1933
01:23:53,028 --> 01:23:54,830
- She just said she needs me.

1934
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,432
- That's a God-damned lie.

1935
01:23:56,465 --> 01:23:57,833
- Fuck you man, how do you know?

1936
01:23:57,866 --> 01:23:59,102
- Because I'm the
first motherfucker

1937
01:23:59,135 --> 01:24:00,569
she told it to, all right.

1938
01:24:00,603 --> 01:24:02,305
- Which is what
according to you?

1939
01:24:04,039 --> 01:24:05,408
- I'm marrying her.

1940
01:24:05,441 --> 01:24:07,310
Isn't that what she said?

1941
01:24:07,343 --> 01:24:08,311
- Who's marrying who?

1942
01:24:08,344 --> 01:24:09,345
- Whose wife?

1943
01:24:09,378 --> 01:24:10,579
- [Wesley] This motherfucker?

1944
01:24:10,613 --> 01:24:11,780
- You?

1945
01:24:11,814 --> 01:24:13,416
- Isn't that what she said?

1946
01:24:13,449 --> 01:24:15,618
Man, what you think about that?

1947
01:24:15,651 --> 01:24:16,852
She gonna be my wife.

1948
01:24:16,885 --> 01:24:19,522
- (scoffs) Did you ask
her or did she ask you?

1949
01:24:19,555 --> 01:24:20,989
- That ain't even important.

1950
01:24:21,023 --> 01:24:22,858
- I thought you didn't
even believe in marriage?

1951
01:24:22,891 --> 01:24:24,660
- Well shit, I might
marry one of 'em just to

1952
01:24:24,693 --> 01:24:26,129
keep the other ones on hold.

1953
01:24:26,162 --> 01:24:28,997
- Now she knows all the lies
that this motherfucker go tell.

1954
01:24:29,031 --> 01:24:31,033
- But the truth, she don't.

1955
01:24:31,066 --> 01:24:33,302
- I ain't got to tell
her nothing about you.

1956
01:24:33,336 --> 01:24:35,938
- Look, look, everything she
gonna know about you man.

1957
01:24:35,971 --> 01:24:37,606
- [Voiceover] Now I can
crack this motherfucker in

1958
01:24:37,640 --> 01:24:39,708
the face with this
glass right now.

1959
01:24:39,742 --> 01:24:41,177
- You can't man.

1960
01:24:41,210 --> 01:24:43,512
- [Voiceover] Twist the
broken in every God-damn cut.

1961
01:24:43,546 --> 01:24:45,181
- No, no he ain't
marrying nobody.

1962
01:24:45,214 --> 01:24:46,882
Ain't nobody marrying nobody.

1963
01:24:46,915 --> 01:24:51,854
- [Voiceover] But naw,
hold up, they say keep

1964
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:54,623
your friends close and
your enemies closer.

1965
01:24:54,657 --> 01:24:55,958
- [Samuel] He ain't
marrying nobody.

1966
01:24:55,991 --> 01:24:57,193
- Congratulations my ass.

1967
01:24:57,226 --> 01:24:58,127
- [Voiceover] So
the fucker sat in

1968
01:24:58,161 --> 01:24:59,695
my house and drank out my cup.

1969
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,730
- Wait, wait, wait,
look, even if you do

1970
01:25:01,764 --> 01:25:03,966
what kind of marriage
you think you gonna have?

1971
01:25:03,999 --> 01:25:05,968
- [Voiceover] I will be so
close beside this motherfucker

1972
01:25:06,001 --> 01:25:07,736
ain't nobody going
to be able to tell

1973
01:25:07,770 --> 01:25:08,704
who the fuck's coming up.

1974
01:25:08,737 --> 01:25:09,872
- I gotta talk to you man.

1975
01:25:09,905 --> 01:25:12,040
Somebody gonna
hurt for this shit.

1976
01:25:12,074 --> 01:25:13,409
- Fuck that man,
you can break that.

1977
01:25:13,442 --> 01:25:14,877
- [Voiceover] We gonna see.

1978
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:16,979
- Look guys we all friends
here, right? Huh? Huh?

1979
01:25:17,012 --> 01:25:18,647
- All right, all
right, just calm down.

1980
01:25:18,681 --> 01:25:20,183
- All right, look, look,
there's plenty to drink.

1981
01:25:20,216 --> 01:25:22,585
- Yeah and, and, and
Chris, Chris got the weave.

1982
01:25:22,618 --> 01:25:24,853
- So all this, just, let's
just relax, all right.

1983
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:26,822
Just a very important
night for us all

1984
01:25:26,855 --> 01:25:29,091
so let's all just calm down.

1985
01:25:29,124 --> 01:25:32,928
- Nigga I'm calm, I'm just
worried about Chris here.

1986
01:25:32,961 --> 01:25:35,030
Is he okay?

1987
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:37,933
- Yeah, no, well I'm, look,

1989
01:26:12,100 --> 01:26:16,305
(water trickling)

1990
01:26:16,339 --> 01:26:21,344
(soft R & B music)

1991
01:26:36,992 --> 01:26:39,962
(screaming)

1992
01:26:39,995 --> 01:26:45,000
(screaming)

1993
01:26:47,202 --> 01:26:52,174
(soft R&B music)

1994
01:27:40,088 --> 01:27:45,093
(hip hop music)
