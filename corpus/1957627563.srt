1
00:00:01,301 --> 00:00:03,403
(dramatic music playing)

2
00:00:29,463 --> 00:00:31,465
Brian: Sit down, Kim.
I'll get the dishes later.

3
00:00:31,465 --> 00:00:33,333
Kim: No, Brian.

4
00:00:33,333 --> 00:00:35,002
Come on, you're pregnant,
and I'm stuffed.

5
00:00:35,002 --> 00:00:36,036
No, I am fine.

6
00:00:36,036 --> 00:00:37,070
I've been sitting
all night.

7
00:00:37,070 --> 00:00:38,472
Let's help clear the table.

8
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:40,908
Mary: She's right.
If I don't get some help,

9
00:00:40,908 --> 00:00:42,209
I'll be here
till the Ice Age.

10
00:00:42,209 --> 00:00:44,545
You notice my husband's
already gone upstairs.

11
00:00:44,545 --> 00:00:46,313
Have a cup, Brian.

12
00:00:47,114 --> 00:00:49,383
See, I shouldn't
open my big mouth.

13
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:50,517
Excuse me.

14
00:00:50,517 --> 00:00:52,686
He hates it when someone
calls his bluff.

15
00:00:52,686 --> 00:00:54,888
Mm-hmm.
Just like his father.

16
00:01:26,220 --> 00:01:29,256
Hey, Avery.
How's it going?

17
00:01:29,256 --> 00:01:30,991
Nobody wants
to play with me.

18
00:01:30,991 --> 00:01:34,228
Not true.
I want to play with you,
but I'm busy, see?

19
00:01:35,362 --> 00:01:36,797
Why don't you do it later?

20
00:01:36,797 --> 00:01:38,497
I can't.

21
00:01:38,497 --> 00:01:40,801
Gotta get this completed
by tomorrow morning.

22
00:01:40,801 --> 00:01:42,569
If I don't get it in,
no grant money.

23
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:44,404
Center goes bust, kaput.

24
00:01:44,404 --> 00:01:46,773
Mary, have you
seen that notebook

25
00:01:46,773 --> 00:01:48,375
with a little
federal ID number?

26
00:01:48,375 --> 00:01:49,643
Oh, that's okay.
I got it!

27
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:57,017
It'd be all my fault.
Be a terrible mess.

28
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:01,989
Avery, don't bother
your grandpa.

29
00:02:01,989 --> 00:02:03,724
He's busy. Besides,
we gotta go. Come on.

30
00:02:05,626 --> 00:02:07,561
I'll be right down, Brian.
(clears throat)

31
00:02:15,802 --> 00:02:18,038
-Is he still up there?
What's the matter with him?
-Yeah.

32
00:02:18,038 --> 00:02:19,840
-You want me to go get him?
-Nothing. Nothing.
No, no, no, it doesn't matter.

33
00:02:19,840 --> 00:02:21,341
He's got a lot on his mind.
It's not important.

34
00:02:21,341 --> 00:02:22,209
-Mwah.
-Goodbye.

35
00:02:22,209 --> 00:02:23,877
-Dinner was great.
-Oh, thanks.

36
00:02:23,877 --> 00:02:25,345
-Thank you.
-Nice to see you.

37
00:02:25,345 --> 00:02:28,749
-Honey, we gotta go.
-Ooh, goodbye,
my beautiful boy.

38
00:02:28,749 --> 00:02:31,952
Oh, drive carefully.
Okay, bye, love you!

39
00:02:31,952 --> 00:02:33,387
-(sighs)
-Bye!

40
00:02:33,387 --> 00:02:35,255
-Bye.
-(door shuts)

41
00:02:38,025 --> 00:02:41,028
-Bob?
-(engine starts)

42
00:02:41,028 --> 00:02:43,530
-Bob?
-Nearly finished, dear.

43
00:02:43,530 --> 00:02:45,065
(sighs)

44
00:02:50,938 --> 00:02:53,540
(upbeat music)

45
00:03:24,071 --> 00:03:26,607
(people singing)

46
00:03:29,977 --> 00:03:33,680
-(people cheering)
-Bob, it's Aisha's birthday.

47
00:03:33,680 --> 00:03:35,415
Happy birthday, Aisha!

48
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:38,418
Does this mean
Aisha has the day off?

49
00:03:38,418 --> 00:03:41,288
-All: No!
-No!

50
00:04:06,613 --> 00:04:09,650
(panting)

51
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,521
(sighs)

52
00:04:14,521 --> 00:04:17,957
Hi, may I speak with
Mr. Garvin, please?

53
00:04:17,957 --> 00:04:20,194
Dr. Robert Shushan,
Developmental Activity Center.

54
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,100
Hey, you forgot about me.

55
00:04:28,168 --> 00:04:31,305
No, no, no. We were--
we were going to speak,
I thought, a couple--

56
00:04:32,906 --> 00:04:36,376
Ah, no.
No, I understand your concerns.

57
00:04:37,544 --> 00:04:40,147
No, we're
a sheltered workshop

58
00:04:40,147 --> 00:04:42,616
for the developmentally
disabled,

59
00:04:42,616 --> 00:04:46,720
and we have successfully
filled loads and loads
of service contracts.

60
00:04:46,720 --> 00:04:49,723
Absolutely convinced
we can fill yours.

61
00:04:49,723 --> 00:04:52,659
The price is--
it's negotiable.

62
00:04:54,194 --> 00:04:56,496
No, no, no,
let me come to you.

63
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,665
No, I think it's better
we talk face-to-face.

64
00:04:58,665 --> 00:05:00,968
Uh, why--
why not right now? Huh?

65
00:05:00,968 --> 00:05:03,504
No time like the present.

66
00:05:03,504 --> 00:05:07,741
Yeah, absolutely.
I'll be there in an hour.

67
00:05:07,741 --> 00:05:10,777
-Dana!
-Yes!

68
00:05:10,777 --> 00:05:13,647
There's the grant application
that needs to be copied

69
00:05:13,647 --> 00:05:16,517
and messengered
no later than 11:00.

70
00:05:16,517 --> 00:05:18,018
Cake?

71
00:05:42,808 --> 00:05:44,211
(tires screech)

72
00:05:44,211 --> 00:05:47,414
(ominous music)

73
00:05:47,414 --> 00:05:50,183
(groaning)

74
00:05:58,125 --> 00:06:00,227
(tires screech)

75
00:06:18,612 --> 00:06:20,280
(door handle rattling)

76
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:27,688
(man grunts)

77
00:06:54,715 --> 00:06:56,517
Bob.

78
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:01,622
(heart monitor beeping)

79
00:07:01,622 --> 00:07:03,423
Bob.

80
00:07:07,060 --> 00:07:09,963
-Hi.
-Hmm.

81
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:12,065
Shh, shh, shh.

82
00:07:14,768 --> 00:07:17,337
You're in the hospital.

83
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:18,438
Hospital?

84
00:07:18,438 --> 00:07:19,439
Mm-hmm.

85
00:07:20,841 --> 00:07:22,309
You had a heart attack.

86
00:07:22,309 --> 00:07:24,511
(grunts)

87
00:07:24,511 --> 00:07:25,579
-Shh.
-No.

88
00:07:25,579 --> 00:07:28,315
-It's all right. Shh.
-Oh.

89
00:07:28,315 --> 00:07:29,750
Oh, the contract.

90
00:07:29,750 --> 00:07:32,719
-Shh. No, no. Shh.
-No... No, the contract.

91
00:07:32,719 --> 00:07:35,589
-Contract...
-Bob, you've got
to let that go.

92
00:07:35,589 --> 00:07:38,892
Put it out of your mind
right now.

93
00:07:38,892 --> 00:07:40,060
You're not well.

94
00:07:41,929 --> 00:07:43,697
Gotta give yourself
a chance.

95
00:07:46,933 --> 00:07:47,935
(gasps)

96
00:07:50,771 --> 00:07:52,873
(indistinct PA announcement)

97
00:07:56,844 --> 00:07:58,579
Dr. Robert Shushan!

98
00:07:58,579 --> 00:08:01,215
Uh, who?
Doctor who?

99
00:08:01,215 --> 00:08:03,684
Dr. Shushan.
He had an accident.

100
00:08:03,684 --> 00:08:04,685
Uh...

101
00:08:10,624 --> 00:08:11,758
Brian?

102
00:08:14,328 --> 00:08:16,964
He brought you
those flowers.

103
00:08:16,964 --> 00:08:18,232
Aren't they beautiful?

104
00:08:19,867 --> 00:08:21,301
Where is he?

105
00:08:22,970 --> 00:08:26,540
He had to leave town
for work this morning.

106
00:08:26,540 --> 00:08:29,710
He said he'd be back
as soon as he could.

107
00:08:29,710 --> 00:08:31,378
He couldn't stay.

108
00:08:31,378 --> 00:08:32,746
Hm-mm.

109
00:08:37,518 --> 00:08:39,886
Man: Dr. Shushan!
I saved his life.

110
00:08:39,886 --> 00:08:41,822
Well, sir,
he's in intensive care.

111
00:08:41,822 --> 00:08:45,092
I'm sorry, but only
his family members
are allowed to visit.

112
00:08:45,092 --> 00:08:47,261
I saved his life!
I found him! It was me!

113
00:08:47,261 --> 00:08:50,931
-Sir, why are you yelling?
-Excuse me.

114
00:08:50,931 --> 00:08:54,935
I'm Dr. Shushan's wife.

115
00:08:54,935 --> 00:08:56,436
I am James Jones!

116
00:08:56,436 --> 00:08:59,139
(giggles nervously)
Yes. I'd like to thank you

117
00:08:59,139 --> 00:09:01,508
for what you did,
Mr. Jones.

118
00:09:01,508 --> 00:09:04,144
Uh, if you'd like,
I'll take you to him.

119
00:09:04,144 --> 00:09:05,846
That is what I want.

120
00:09:08,482 --> 00:09:11,084
(heart monitor beeping)

121
00:09:24,064 --> 00:09:28,836
He's very sick, James.
He's lucky you found him.

122
00:09:30,137 --> 00:09:31,371
Shushan will live.

123
00:09:31,371 --> 00:09:33,207
It's not his time
to join the great spirit.

124
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:37,511
-(device beeps loudly)
-(groans)

125
00:09:37,511 --> 00:09:40,881
-(murmurs)
-Um, they say that his heart
will make little blips--

126
00:09:43,016 --> 00:09:45,319
-(door opens)
-James.

127
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:47,354
(door slams)

128
00:09:47,354 --> 00:09:49,890
(dramatic music)

129
00:09:49,890 --> 00:09:51,358
Woman on PA:
Dr. Meyers.

130
00:09:51,358 --> 00:09:54,127
Dr. Paul Meyers.
Please contact...

131
00:09:57,264 --> 00:10:00,567
(birds chirping)

132
00:10:01,969 --> 00:10:04,805
(TV on, indistinct)

133
00:10:11,378 --> 00:10:13,480
You're sulking.

134
00:10:13,480 --> 00:10:16,450
Goes with the diet.
I think it's therapeutic.

135
00:10:16,450 --> 00:10:19,486
Well, why don't
you get off that couch
and move around a little?

136
00:10:19,486 --> 00:10:20,721
Been home
for over a week.

137
00:10:20,721 --> 00:10:22,523
The doctor
wants you exercising.

138
00:10:22,523 --> 00:10:24,358
Maybe we should make love.

139
00:10:26,927 --> 00:10:28,762
Just joking.

140
00:10:28,762 --> 00:10:30,464
I don't see the humor.

141
00:10:31,899 --> 00:10:33,200
I almost lost you.

142
00:10:33,200 --> 00:10:36,203
I don't think we have another
chance if this happens again.

143
00:10:36,203 --> 00:10:38,739
Fine, Mary.

144
00:10:41,475 --> 00:10:43,577
Your food's in the fridge.
I'll be back soon.

145
00:10:43,577 --> 00:10:46,780
I'll stop by the shop
and pick up the car
if it's ready.

146
00:10:46,780 --> 00:10:49,016
How long
you gonna be?

147
00:10:49,016 --> 00:10:50,083
I don't know.
A few hours.

148
00:10:54,021 --> 00:10:56,089
Call Brian.

149
00:10:56,089 --> 00:10:58,592
Why don't you call Brian
and tell him to call me?

150
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,196
Call Brian.

151
00:11:03,664 --> 00:11:06,667
(gentle orchestral music)

152
00:11:09,369 --> 00:11:11,238
(indistinct chatter)

153
00:11:20,147 --> 00:11:22,583
-Sorry I'm late.
-Hi.

154
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,486
Boy, you look great,
considering all you've
been through.

155
00:11:27,788 --> 00:11:29,957
The flowers were
very beautiful.
Thank you.

156
00:11:29,957 --> 00:11:32,359
Oh, yeah,
you're welcome.

157
00:11:32,359 --> 00:11:34,328
You had to go to town.

158
00:11:35,662 --> 00:11:37,531
Yeah, I'm sorry.
I-- I had to...

159
00:11:37,531 --> 00:11:40,000
I had to lock in
that... bid,

160
00:11:40,000 --> 00:11:42,202
and then when I got back,
it was just crazy.

161
00:11:42,202 --> 00:11:44,304
I-- I meant to visit you,
but I-- I've been nuts.

162
00:11:44,304 --> 00:11:45,539
(chuckling)
No, I know, I know, I know.

163
00:11:45,539 --> 00:11:48,175
You hear the one about
the fellow who came into the bar

164
00:11:48,175 --> 00:11:49,810
and yelled
at the bartender,

165
00:11:49,810 --> 00:11:51,411
"Quick, give me 10 martinis,"

166
00:11:51,411 --> 00:11:54,848
and the bartender
looks at him and puts
10 martinis out on the bar,

167
00:11:54,848 --> 00:11:56,350
and he starts drinking
them really fast,

168
00:11:56,350 --> 00:11:58,519
two, three, four, five,
like that.

169
00:11:58,519 --> 00:12:01,021
And the bartender says,
"Hey, slow down.

170
00:12:01,021 --> 00:12:03,257
I wouldn't
drink 'em that fast
if I were you."

171
00:12:03,257 --> 00:12:05,325
And the fella says...
(slurping)

172
00:12:05,325 --> 00:12:08,762
"You'd drink 'em this fast
if you had what I have."

173
00:12:08,762 --> 00:12:11,865
And the bartender says...

174
00:12:12,799 --> 00:12:14,768
"What do you have?"

175
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:16,737
And he says...

176
00:12:16,737 --> 00:12:18,138
"Fifty cents."

177
00:12:18,138 --> 00:12:19,640
(both chuckle)

178
00:12:20,774 --> 00:12:21,608
That's good.

179
00:12:24,811 --> 00:12:26,980
(sighs)

180
00:12:26,980 --> 00:12:29,149
What is wrong, Brian?

181
00:12:32,352 --> 00:12:34,288
Nothing's wrong.

182
00:12:34,288 --> 00:12:36,123
Boy, oh, boy.

183
00:12:36,123 --> 00:12:38,292
I don't know how
you ever got so angry.

184
00:12:38,292 --> 00:12:40,527
I'm not angry.

185
00:12:40,527 --> 00:12:42,863
Well, it has to be fixed.

186
00:12:42,863 --> 00:12:46,233
Whatever it is
that's wrong between us,

187
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,901
it has to be fixed.

188
00:12:55,242 --> 00:12:56,777
Why?

189
00:12:56,777 --> 00:12:59,179
I-- I don't understand.

190
00:12:59,179 --> 00:13:01,982
Why-- Why does
it have to be fixed?

191
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,952
That's an appalling question.

192
00:13:04,952 --> 00:13:07,321
No, it's not.

193
00:13:07,321 --> 00:13:09,456
It's a-- It's a--
It's a good question.

194
00:13:11,325 --> 00:13:13,660
Dad, whatever this is...

195
00:13:13,660 --> 00:13:18,432
what-- whatever our relationship
has become, it works.

196
00:13:18,432 --> 00:13:21,568
You know?
We-- We don't fight.
We're polite.

197
00:13:22,603 --> 00:13:27,374
We do holidays together.
We-- We get along.
We have peace.

198
00:13:27,374 --> 00:13:29,743
It's pretty good.
A lot of people don't have that.

199
00:13:31,111 --> 00:13:32,779
I just-- I just thought
that after--

200
00:13:32,779 --> 00:13:35,549
I can't-- I can't--
I don't have time.

201
00:13:35,549 --> 00:13:37,618
-Sir. Sir. Excuse me.
-Yes, sir.

202
00:13:37,618 --> 00:13:40,454
Uh, can I order?
I'm-- I'm pressed for time.

203
00:13:40,454 --> 00:13:42,089
Waiter:
I'll be right there.

204
00:13:43,924 --> 00:13:45,492
Brian:
What do you want?

205
00:13:51,999 --> 00:13:55,802
Mary, if I don't have my work,
I might just as well be dead.

206
00:13:55,802 --> 00:13:58,505
All I know is work.

207
00:13:58,505 --> 00:14:00,574
All you know.

208
00:14:00,574 --> 00:14:03,944
You know what I mean.
I promise you, I will
get some time off.

209
00:14:03,944 --> 00:14:06,313
I'm not talking
about a vacation.

210
00:14:06,313 --> 00:14:07,514
I'm talking about us.

211
00:14:07,514 --> 00:14:09,583
Us? The two of us?

212
00:14:09,583 --> 00:14:12,853
Us. Us. And "us" is not us
if one of us is dead.

213
00:14:12,853 --> 00:14:14,454
Oh, please.

214
00:14:14,454 --> 00:14:17,090
People have heart attacks
all the time,

215
00:14:17,090 --> 00:14:19,226
and they
go back to work.

216
00:15:01,068 --> 00:15:03,070
(all cheering)

217
00:15:04,304 --> 00:15:05,639
Welcome back, Doctor!

218
00:15:07,674 --> 00:15:09,977
Great to see you.

219
00:15:15,449 --> 00:15:18,118
All right!
We missed you!

220
00:15:18,118 --> 00:15:19,419
-I bet.
-It was very relaxing.

221
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:21,355
-(laughs)
-Yeah.

222
00:15:21,355 --> 00:15:24,358
Uh, look, Geller
wants to see you, uh,
whenever you feel up to it.

223
00:15:24,358 --> 00:15:27,461
Okay, good.
Okay, good. Hi, Grace!

224
00:15:27,461 --> 00:15:29,296
Hi.

225
00:15:31,131 --> 00:15:32,799
(phone rings)

226
00:15:32,799 --> 00:15:34,601
Woman:
One moment, please.

227
00:15:34,601 --> 00:15:37,004
(phones ringing)

228
00:15:38,672 --> 00:15:40,807
Bob.
(laughs)

229
00:15:40,807 --> 00:15:41,975
So good to see you back.

230
00:15:41,975 --> 00:15:44,478
Oh, good to be back.
I can't just sit.

231
00:15:44,478 --> 00:15:46,146
Come on in.
Have a seat.

232
00:15:46,146 --> 00:15:47,581
Sure. Thanks.

233
00:15:49,316 --> 00:15:52,920
I mean, I--
I feel great, actually.

234
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:56,223
I mean, I should have
been doing the exercise.

235
00:15:56,223 --> 00:15:58,859
This just gives me
a little more incentive.

236
00:15:58,859 --> 00:16:01,995
Of course. Hey, how's Mary
handling all this?

237
00:16:01,995 --> 00:16:03,931
Oh, she's a trooper.

238
00:16:03,931 --> 00:16:05,199
But I'm-- I'm fine.

239
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,068
Good. You know, I--
I wouldn't minimize this.

240
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:11,171
You know, Bob...

241
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:13,440
your work here
over the the decades

242
00:16:13,440 --> 00:16:15,242
has been
an enormous effort.

243
00:16:15,242 --> 00:16:17,978
And I know that everyone
that sits on the board,
including myself,

244
00:16:17,978 --> 00:16:20,080
are deeply indebted.

245
00:16:20,080 --> 00:16:24,318
Well, I just...
get up and go to work
like anybody else.

246
00:16:24,318 --> 00:16:27,554
But that's, uh, thank you.
That's very comforting.

247
00:16:27,554 --> 00:16:29,923
Very, very flattering.

248
00:16:29,923 --> 00:16:32,693
Well, it needed
to be said.

249
00:16:32,693 --> 00:16:35,696
Your illness was
a real wake-up call for us.

250
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:38,498
Was a wake-up call
for you guys?

251
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:41,435
Yeah. I mean, the center
depends on you,

252
00:16:41,435 --> 00:16:43,937
which is why
the board has come

253
00:16:43,937 --> 00:16:46,340
to some collective decisions.

254
00:16:46,340 --> 00:16:49,343
We want to find a way
to maintain the same level

255
00:16:49,343 --> 00:16:51,411
of leadership
you've shown us.

256
00:16:51,411 --> 00:16:53,046
Will you help us in return?

257
00:16:57,084 --> 00:17:00,120
Uh... I'll...

258
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:01,822
I'll do anything
for the center.

259
00:17:01,822 --> 00:17:04,458
What-- What, uh...

260
00:17:04,458 --> 00:17:07,560
What-- What can I do?

261
00:17:07,560 --> 00:17:09,663
(indistinct chatter)

262
00:17:13,333 --> 00:17:15,169
-You knew?
-Well, I guessed.

263
00:17:15,169 --> 00:17:16,369
I mean, you're close
to retirement--

264
00:17:16,369 --> 00:17:19,640
37 years.
That son of a...

265
00:17:19,640 --> 00:17:21,474
"We want you
to leave, Bob.

266
00:17:21,474 --> 00:17:23,242
But before you go,
find your replacement."

267
00:17:23,242 --> 00:17:26,079
That's like a firing squad
getting you to dig
your own grave

268
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:28,315
before they shoot you!

269
00:17:29,016 --> 00:17:30,417
(mutters)

270
00:17:35,822 --> 00:17:37,524
Man: It's lunchtime!

271
00:17:39,459 --> 00:17:42,262
It's lunchtime,
and I need help!

272
00:17:43,530 --> 00:17:44,831
Uh, what kind of help?

273
00:17:44,831 --> 00:17:47,334
I forgot my lunch!

274
00:17:48,902 --> 00:17:52,773
-Well, I'm sorry about that.
-I forgot my lunch!

275
00:17:52,773 --> 00:17:54,508
I saved your life.

276
00:17:54,508 --> 00:17:58,745
You-- You should
buy me lunch, Dr. Shushan.

277
00:18:15,929 --> 00:18:18,632
Might have been quicker
if we'd done this as takeout.

278
00:18:18,632 --> 00:18:20,467
I like it here!

279
00:18:20,467 --> 00:18:23,403
No need to yell, James.

280
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,078
You're an angry man today.

281
00:18:32,779 --> 00:18:34,047
I am.

282
00:18:36,917 --> 00:18:37,918
Why?

283
00:18:39,720 --> 00:18:42,890
-Doesn't concern you.
-Confide!

284
00:18:45,592 --> 00:18:48,462
You are disturbing
other people, James.

285
00:18:48,462 --> 00:18:50,797
That is not acceptable.

286
00:18:50,797 --> 00:18:53,066
I love everybody.

287
00:18:53,066 --> 00:18:57,204
Blessed be all who walk
in the Kingdom of God!

288
00:19:01,208 --> 00:19:02,976
Tell me
why you're angry.

289
00:19:02,976 --> 00:19:06,346
I saved your life. We're like--
We're like blood brothers!

290
00:19:06,346 --> 00:19:09,149
I know you. Heh.

291
00:19:09,149 --> 00:19:10,450
You work too hard.

292
00:19:10,450 --> 00:19:12,019
The people at the center
don't help you.

293
00:19:12,019 --> 00:19:16,123
(scoffs) The people
at the center canned me.

294
00:19:20,060 --> 00:19:21,628
They fired me.

295
00:19:22,696 --> 00:19:24,898
(mutters)

296
00:19:24,898 --> 00:19:26,133
(silverware clattering loudly)

297
00:19:26,133 --> 00:19:28,669
How can they fire
Dr. Shushan?

298
00:19:28,669 --> 00:19:30,537
The world should know
what you have done!

299
00:19:30,537 --> 00:19:32,439
-It's not right.
They can't fire you!
-We're gonna have to go.

300
00:19:32,439 --> 00:19:33,740
Can I have my bill, please?
Sorry about this.

301
00:19:33,740 --> 00:19:36,109
How could you
let them fire you?
You let them fire you!

302
00:19:36,109 --> 00:19:37,678
I didn't let them fire me!
I didn't have any choice,
James.

303
00:19:37,678 --> 00:19:39,680
Well, we will stop them!
We will stop them.

304
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:42,216
No, we will talk to them.
They don't know what
they're doing!

305
00:19:42,216 --> 00:19:44,117
We're gonna go talk to them.
We will go back to the center...

306
00:19:44,117 --> 00:19:47,421
-No, injustice! Injustice!
-Oh, shut up! Shut up!

307
00:19:47,421 --> 00:19:49,756
Shut up! Shut up!
Shut up!

308
00:19:52,492 --> 00:19:53,594
(James whimpers softly)

309
00:19:55,362 --> 00:19:56,964
(traffic noise)

310
00:20:13,280 --> 00:20:14,848
(sighs)

311
00:20:14,848 --> 00:20:17,684
Excuse me.
I'm terribly sorry.

312
00:20:17,684 --> 00:20:18,752
Excuse me, ma'am.

313
00:20:31,064 --> 00:20:33,066
(indistinct chatter)

314
00:20:33,066 --> 00:20:35,469
Yeah, in this box
right here.

315
00:20:42,709 --> 00:20:44,711
(distant train whistle)

316
00:20:56,190 --> 00:20:57,191
(grunts)

317
00:21:04,665 --> 00:21:05,899
Hey.

318
00:21:07,000 --> 00:21:11,071
Hey! What the hell
do you think you're doing?

319
00:21:11,071 --> 00:21:12,873
-I'm helping.
-Well, knock it off.

320
00:21:12,873 --> 00:21:14,675
All that stuff's got to go
to the next stop.

321
00:21:18,779 --> 00:21:21,515
You took it out.
You put it back.

322
00:21:21,515 --> 00:21:22,583
Go on.

323
00:21:24,952 --> 00:21:27,287
Let's go, Wolfman.
Hello?

324
00:21:32,860 --> 00:21:33,861
(grunts)

325
00:21:36,797 --> 00:21:39,366
(faint chatter)

326
00:21:45,405 --> 00:21:47,741
How was your lunch
with Mr. Jones?

327
00:21:51,678 --> 00:21:55,883
Do they have an interview
appointment scheduled
for my replacement?

328
00:21:58,352 --> 00:22:00,888
Yeah. Tomorrow.

329
00:22:10,864 --> 00:22:13,233
I want a desk!
I have to have a desk!

330
00:22:13,233 --> 00:22:14,535
-I have to have a desk!
-Whoa. What?

331
00:22:14,535 --> 00:22:16,336
A desk! I want one!

332
00:22:16,336 --> 00:22:20,040
I don't understand.
You want someplace
to write something down?

333
00:22:20,040 --> 00:22:23,510
Yeah! No! I--

334
00:22:23,510 --> 00:22:26,480
I don't know! I just--
I just need to have a desk.

335
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:28,549
This isn't a desk, but if
you want to write something--

336
00:22:28,549 --> 00:22:30,184
I said a desk!

337
00:22:30,184 --> 00:22:32,319
It's gotta be a desk!

338
00:22:32,319 --> 00:22:34,154
You're getting fired,
give me your desk!

339
00:22:36,523 --> 00:22:37,824
(whimpers softly)

340
00:22:43,030 --> 00:22:45,632
(grunting)

341
00:22:45,632 --> 00:22:47,668
Crazy.

342
00:22:47,668 --> 00:22:50,804
(laughing)

343
00:22:50,804 --> 00:22:55,275
Desk. Desk to sit at.
Desk.

344
00:22:55,275 --> 00:22:58,912
Desk. Desk. Desk.

345
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,480
Desk to sit at.

346
00:23:00,480 --> 00:23:03,417
Desk to sit at.
Desk to sit at.

347
00:23:03,417 --> 00:23:06,119
-James. James. James.
-Desk.

348
00:23:06,119 --> 00:23:09,223
I'm sorry
I yelled at you
at lunch.

349
00:23:11,024 --> 00:23:13,260
Do I get a desk?

350
00:23:13,260 --> 00:23:16,697
Doesn't have
to be your desk.
Any desk would do.

351
00:23:17,931 --> 00:23:19,833
What do you want
a desk for?

352
00:23:23,170 --> 00:23:24,905
Hmm?

353
00:23:28,375 --> 00:23:31,879
Two cases...
toilet paper!

354
00:23:31,879 --> 00:23:34,281
Two cases paper towels!

355
00:23:36,016 --> 00:23:37,584
One case, not two!

356
00:23:38,986 --> 00:23:41,889
See what happens?
One case, not two!

357
00:23:41,889 --> 00:23:44,992
This is what you get
without without a desk!

358
00:23:44,992 --> 00:23:48,495
-Calm down, James.
-You-- You get it wrong!

359
00:23:50,030 --> 00:23:54,001
Y-You get everything wrong.
You only get one damn case!

360
00:23:54,001 --> 00:23:55,936
'Cause...

361
00:23:55,936 --> 00:23:57,638
'Cause they--
they won't listen.

362
00:23:57,638 --> 00:23:58,906
Who won't listen?

363
00:23:58,906 --> 00:24:00,407
Nobody!

364
00:24:00,407 --> 00:24:03,644
People don't listen because
you don't make them listen.

365
00:24:03,644 --> 00:24:06,246
You have to present yourself
in a different light.

366
00:24:08,649 --> 00:24:10,517
Light!

367
00:24:11,652 --> 00:24:16,290
Okay, forget about light.
It's not light. It's you.

368
00:24:16,290 --> 00:24:18,859
It's how you are,
what you look like,
how you sound.

369
00:24:18,859 --> 00:24:21,862
This is who I am.
I'm-- I'm James Jones.

370
00:24:21,862 --> 00:24:24,765
I got Cherokee blood
in my veins!

371
00:24:24,765 --> 00:24:26,567
And-- and if people
don't like it,

372
00:24:26,567 --> 00:24:28,001
-they can just--
-They can what?

373
00:24:28,001 --> 00:24:29,369
They can leave you alone?

374
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:32,072
They can not listen?
What?

375
00:24:33,307 --> 00:24:36,310
Let me-- Let me try
something here.

376
00:24:36,310 --> 00:24:39,379
See how straight
that broom is?

377
00:24:40,480 --> 00:24:41,882
Okay, hold that broom.

378
00:24:43,250 --> 00:24:45,485
Stand straight with it.
Here, take it in your hand.

379
00:24:45,485 --> 00:24:47,120
People don't care
what I look like.

380
00:24:47,120 --> 00:24:50,691
Yes, they do. Believe me.
Now, take the broom.

381
00:24:55,963 --> 00:24:56,997
(sniffles)

382
00:24:56,997 --> 00:24:58,198
Okay. There you go.

383
00:24:58,198 --> 00:24:59,466
Now hold it up
a little higher.

384
00:24:59,466 --> 00:25:01,001
Put your
shoulder blades together.

385
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:02,436
Keep it straight.
Straight.

386
00:25:02,436 --> 00:25:05,405
Get your forehead back,
get your chin up.

387
00:25:05,405 --> 00:25:08,175
That's it.
You feel straight?

388
00:25:08,175 --> 00:25:10,777
Okay, now start walking.
Try walking straight.

389
00:25:12,479 --> 00:25:14,982
Good.

390
00:25:14,982 --> 00:25:16,917
(chuckles)
Good.

391
00:25:16,917 --> 00:25:18,485
(laughs)
Yeah.

392
00:25:18,485 --> 00:25:20,354
I'm walking.

393
00:25:20,354 --> 00:25:22,022
I'm walking like
a damn supervisor!

394
00:25:22,022 --> 00:25:23,857
Yeah, now people
will listen to you.

395
00:25:23,857 --> 00:25:24,858
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

396
00:25:24,858 --> 00:25:27,094
Walking like a guy
somebody'd be listening to.

397
00:25:27,094 --> 00:25:28,028
Yeah.

398
00:25:29,796 --> 00:25:31,832
Now do I get a desk?

399
00:25:33,567 --> 00:25:36,970
(gentle piano music)

400
00:25:36,970 --> 00:25:38,972
-Attaboy, Brian.
-Dad! Dad!

401
00:25:38,972 --> 00:25:41,208
-(phone ringing)
-You just have to get
the kite up in the air.

402
00:25:41,208 --> 00:25:43,477
If you hold the line,
it's probably better.

403
00:25:43,477 --> 00:25:45,746
Let me come, and I'll hold
the kite for you, and--

404
00:25:45,746 --> 00:25:48,448
-I can't get it--
-Hold on a second, Brian.
There's the phone.

405
00:25:48,448 --> 00:25:50,184
-Can you help me?
-Hello?

406
00:25:50,184 --> 00:25:53,587
-Dad, come here!
-Hello! Hey, I thought you
had forgotten about me.

407
00:25:53,587 --> 00:25:56,490
-You couldn't forget about...
-Dad, come here!

408
00:25:56,490 --> 00:25:59,293
(laughs) I'm your man.
I'll be right there...

409
00:25:59,293 --> 00:26:01,862
-Brian: Dad where are you?
-I have nothing else to do.

410
00:26:01,862 --> 00:26:04,331
-I'll see you right away.
-Dad, where are you?!

411
00:26:05,933 --> 00:26:07,868
(clock ticking)

412
00:26:07,868 --> 00:26:10,304
(sighs)

413
00:26:12,406 --> 00:26:14,408
(clock chiming softly)

414
00:26:51,545 --> 00:26:55,048
I'm so sorry, Mary.
I let you down.

415
00:26:55,048 --> 00:26:56,583
Can't figure out
how it happened.

416
00:26:59,353 --> 00:27:02,122
I've been looking back
at my life, and I have...

417
00:27:02,122 --> 00:27:05,926
no idea how I got
to this place.

418
00:27:08,462 --> 00:27:11,565
I-- I showed somebody
how to stand up straight today.

419
00:27:11,565 --> 00:27:16,436
James Jones, the fellow
who pulled me out of the car.

420
00:27:16,436 --> 00:27:19,773
I showed him how
to stand up straight.

421
00:27:23,143 --> 00:27:24,811
And he was so happy.

422
00:27:28,115 --> 00:27:29,650
I don't understand.

423
00:27:29,650 --> 00:27:31,985
Well, it's-- it's what
I started out doing,

424
00:27:31,985 --> 00:27:33,420
it was what I wanted
to do with my life,

425
00:27:33,420 --> 00:27:37,291
show people how to use
the outside of themselves,

426
00:27:37,291 --> 00:27:39,426
how to change
the way they look,

427
00:27:39,426 --> 00:27:42,663
the way people looked at them
so that they could...

428
00:27:42,663 --> 00:27:45,966
-free the inside
of themselves.
-Mm.

429
00:27:45,966 --> 00:27:49,837
Uh, good self-esteem
and... confidence.

430
00:27:52,339 --> 00:27:56,777
I've wasted all these years
pushing papers, and...

431
00:27:56,777 --> 00:28:00,380
applying for grants
and looking at budgets.

432
00:28:01,882 --> 00:28:06,620
I've become an administrator,
a bureaucrat.

433
00:28:06,620 --> 00:28:10,090
I've hurt
everyone I ever loved...

434
00:28:10,090 --> 00:28:14,027
(crying) doing something
I never intended to do
in the first place.

435
00:28:17,130 --> 00:28:18,765
Oy...
(sighs)

436
00:28:20,434 --> 00:28:23,437
I think I've lost
my soul, Mary.

437
00:28:24,538 --> 00:28:28,008
And I have no idea
how I can get it back.

438
00:28:32,045 --> 00:28:33,514
(sighs)

439
00:28:49,530 --> 00:28:51,532
(indistinct chatter)

440
00:28:57,504 --> 00:28:59,740
Magna cum laude.

441
00:29:01,575 --> 00:29:03,076
And you have
a master's degree

442
00:29:03,076 --> 00:29:05,345
from the Northwestern
School of Business.

443
00:29:08,549 --> 00:29:10,717
That's very impressive.

444
00:29:10,717 --> 00:29:12,219
Thank you.

445
00:29:13,887 --> 00:29:17,191
But there's more to this
than just administration.

446
00:29:17,191 --> 00:29:20,194
I mean, you have to be
hands-on with these people.

447
00:29:20,194 --> 00:29:23,130
It requires--
you have to use instinct.

448
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,933
-You have to have passion.
-Mm-hmm. I understand.

449
00:29:25,933 --> 00:29:31,071
And some of them
are profoundly disabled,
and that requires a...

450
00:29:32,873 --> 00:29:34,808
...a great deal
of patience.

451
00:29:34,808 --> 00:29:37,444
Of course.

452
00:29:37,444 --> 00:29:40,681
But I think I'm well equipped
to function along those lines.

453
00:29:41,882 --> 00:29:44,785
Yeah, well,
confidence is a good thing.

454
00:29:46,119 --> 00:29:49,423
Who the hell keeps
stuffing shoes
in the damn toilet?!

455
00:29:49,423 --> 00:29:52,226
-James.
-I my work hard!
I can't take this!

456
00:29:52,226 --> 00:29:54,094
You're interrupting.

457
00:29:54,094 --> 00:29:56,096
You're not listening,
just like everybody else!

458
00:29:56,096 --> 00:29:58,832
Walk away, James.
We'll talk about it later.

459
00:29:58,832 --> 00:30:01,969
-I saved your life!
-Get out!

460
00:30:09,343 --> 00:30:11,578
(James groans loudly)

461
00:30:11,578 --> 00:30:13,113
(chuckling)

462
00:30:16,149 --> 00:30:19,186
Well, that's kind of
what I mean about...

463
00:30:19,186 --> 00:30:20,754
Oh, did you get that
on your suit?

464
00:30:20,754 --> 00:30:24,525
Oh, I'm sorry.
Uh, does it smell?

465
00:30:24,525 --> 00:30:25,792
Ohh.

466
00:30:39,907 --> 00:30:41,241
You're angry.

467
00:30:42,276 --> 00:30:43,310
Well, you yelled!

468
00:30:43,310 --> 00:30:47,080
You yelled too, so we're even,
but that's not why you're angry.

469
00:30:48,949 --> 00:30:50,951
Why are you angry, James?

470
00:30:52,186 --> 00:30:54,721
Because people
won't give you a desk?

471
00:30:55,889 --> 00:30:58,659
'Cause people won't
listen to you? Why?

472
00:31:03,964 --> 00:31:06,300
Say it.
Say what you're thinking.

473
00:31:11,371 --> 00:31:13,207
I want to be the...

474
00:31:13,207 --> 00:31:15,509
I want to be the kind
of person that-- that...

475
00:31:18,545 --> 00:31:20,447
that my father
would be proud of!

476
00:31:22,316 --> 00:31:24,451
What kind
of a person is that?

477
00:31:25,686 --> 00:31:28,555
Somebody that people
listen to.

478
00:31:28,555 --> 00:31:32,359
Somebody that sits
at a desk... like you!

479
00:31:34,595 --> 00:31:36,797
I'm sure your father
loves you, James.

480
00:31:36,797 --> 00:31:38,999
Not love! Uh, proud!

481
00:31:38,999 --> 00:31:40,634
I want my father
to be proud of me.

482
00:31:41,869 --> 00:31:43,437
Bob:
And he isn't?

483
00:31:45,839 --> 00:31:48,909
I haven't...

484
00:31:48,909 --> 00:31:52,746
I haven't seen my father
since I was...

485
00:31:52,746 --> 00:31:54,681
six years old.

486
00:31:55,582 --> 00:31:57,951
Then he's not
a part of your life, James.

487
00:31:59,586 --> 00:32:04,491
But he is near,
and-- and we will
see each other soon!

488
00:32:04,491 --> 00:32:07,427
It's-- It's part
of the great destiny.

489
00:32:07,427 --> 00:32:09,530
Great Destiny?

490
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:10,764
Yeah.

491
00:32:10,764 --> 00:32:15,102
Things that have
to happen, things that--
that will happen.

492
00:32:15,102 --> 00:32:16,970
Bob: And you want
to be ready?

493
00:32:16,970 --> 00:32:19,106
Ready.

494
00:32:21,775 --> 00:32:23,577
Yeah.

495
00:32:25,012 --> 00:32:27,347
He will--
He will look at me...

496
00:32:29,550 --> 00:32:31,318
And he will be...

497
00:32:31,318 --> 00:32:33,287
he will be happy it is me.

498
00:32:35,689 --> 00:32:37,291
Proud of me.

499
00:32:41,328 --> 00:32:42,996
I wanna be ready.

500
00:32:48,735 --> 00:32:52,072
This has been
a good conversation, James.

501
00:32:58,078 --> 00:33:00,080
(indistinct chatter)

502
00:33:02,850 --> 00:33:05,452
I need
James Jones's file.

503
00:33:05,452 --> 00:33:07,120
Why?

504
00:33:13,026 --> 00:33:15,896
Mr. Jones
is a walking catastrophe.

505
00:33:15,896 --> 00:33:18,665
He has bounced around
the system his entire life,

506
00:33:18,665 --> 00:33:21,101
and that is because
nobody can handle him.

507
00:33:21,101 --> 00:33:23,370
He is defensive,
he is recalcitrant,

508
00:33:23,370 --> 00:33:25,572
and he has been known
to be violent.

509
00:33:25,572 --> 00:33:26,874
I'm a big boy, Dana.

510
00:33:28,809 --> 00:33:30,711
You know,
you don't owe him anything.

511
00:33:33,080 --> 00:33:34,748
I'll get you the file.

512
00:33:35,983 --> 00:33:38,185
(toilet flushing)

513
00:33:40,153 --> 00:33:41,788
James?

514
00:33:41,788 --> 00:33:43,857
-James?
-(grunts)

515
00:33:43,857 --> 00:33:46,827
I've come to the conclusion
that you're absolutely right

516
00:33:46,827 --> 00:33:49,363
about having a desk.

517
00:33:49,363 --> 00:33:53,200
-What?
-I think it's important
that you have a desk.

518
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,002
A desk?

519
00:33:55,002 --> 00:33:56,837
You better believe it.

520
00:33:56,837 --> 00:33:58,272
Then I--
Then I can sit down.

521
00:33:58,272 --> 00:34:00,340
I'll have-- I'll have paper.
I'll have pencils.

522
00:34:00,340 --> 00:34:02,009
I-- I could
have a phone.

523
00:34:02,009 --> 00:34:03,810
(chuckling)
Wait, hang on a second.

524
00:34:03,810 --> 00:34:05,379
It-- It's going to happen,

525
00:34:05,379 --> 00:34:08,315
but you're going
to have to earn it.

526
00:34:08,315 --> 00:34:10,083
Okay, then
I'll work harder.

527
00:34:10,083 --> 00:34:13,387
No, no, that's not
what I mean. Not work.

528
00:34:13,387 --> 00:34:17,024
It's you. You're going
to have to earn it

529
00:34:17,024 --> 00:34:18,692
by getting yourself
cleaned up.

530
00:34:18,692 --> 00:34:20,627
Gonna have to take
a shower every day,

531
00:34:20,627 --> 00:34:23,063
you're gonna have to get
new clothes, get a haircut,

532
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:24,864
something done
about that beard.

533
00:34:24,864 --> 00:34:27,134
-Okay?
-Well, I can't
do all that.

534
00:34:27,134 --> 00:34:29,002
Sure, you can.

535
00:34:30,270 --> 00:34:31,871
No, you don't--
you don't understand.

536
00:34:33,273 --> 00:34:35,342
Talk to me, James.

537
00:34:37,444 --> 00:34:39,179
It's too hard!
It's too many words!

538
00:34:39,179 --> 00:34:42,482
Well then,
how can I understand?

539
00:34:47,221 --> 00:34:49,456
Follow me, Dr. Shushan.

540
00:34:51,225 --> 00:34:53,659
Hurry up, Dr. Shushan.

541
00:34:55,027 --> 00:35:00,100
James!
Where are you taking me?

542
00:35:14,047 --> 00:35:16,817
-Hold on tight,
Dr. Shushan!
-Okay.

543
00:35:16,817 --> 00:35:19,119
Don't let anybody
pick your pocket!

544
00:35:19,119 --> 00:35:20,821
I'm right behind you,
James.

545
00:35:20,821 --> 00:35:22,689
You don't need to yell.

546
00:35:22,689 --> 00:35:27,027
Oh Lord, Our Savior,
bless this bus and all
who ride within!

547
00:35:29,563 --> 00:35:35,335
(speaking Spanish)

548
00:35:35,335 --> 00:35:37,704
Hold it down, James.

549
00:35:37,704 --> 00:35:40,974
And keep Dr. Shushan
from getting shot!

550
00:35:40,974 --> 00:35:44,444
Or knifed!
Or robbed!

551
00:35:51,952 --> 00:35:54,721
-Hey, Wolf Man! What's up?
-(James shouts)

552
00:35:55,989 --> 00:35:58,158
That dude
has his shots, man.
(laughs)

553
00:35:58,158 --> 00:36:00,327
See, Dr. Shushan?

554
00:36:00,327 --> 00:36:02,796
Around here, you can't walk
like a supervisor.

555
00:36:02,796 --> 00:36:05,098
Unless you're a cop.

556
00:36:05,098 --> 00:36:07,034
Gotta walk tough.
You gotta be tough.

557
00:36:07,034 --> 00:36:09,503
-Man: Nice jacket, man.
-(high-pitched shout)

558
00:36:09,503 --> 00:36:11,905
-(men laugh)
-Why I studied karate.

559
00:36:11,905 --> 00:36:14,007
(distant sirens)

560
00:36:14,875 --> 00:36:16,910
(car alarm blaring,
men talking)

561
00:36:24,251 --> 00:36:28,121
(door buzzes)

562
00:36:36,697 --> 00:36:38,966
-James?
-Yeah.

563
00:36:46,740 --> 00:36:48,542
And just who might you be?

564
00:36:48,542 --> 00:36:52,312
I'm Dr. Robert Shushan.
I'm a friend of James'.

565
00:36:52,312 --> 00:36:55,015
I didn't know James
had friends.

566
00:36:55,015 --> 00:36:57,251
Dr. Shushan
runs the center,
Mrs. Flowers.

567
00:36:57,251 --> 00:36:59,086
He's-- He's a great man.

568
00:36:59,086 --> 00:37:01,755
-Why is he here?
-To see my life.

569
00:37:01,755 --> 00:37:04,858
I run a good home.
Understand?

570
00:37:04,858 --> 00:37:06,059
If you are some kind
of an inspector--

571
00:37:06,059 --> 00:37:09,229
Pl-Please. No. Uh...
James is right.

572
00:37:09,229 --> 00:37:11,965
I'm here to find out
more about James.

573
00:37:14,701 --> 00:37:16,236
Follow me, Dr. Shushan.

574
00:37:16,236 --> 00:37:17,638
Excuse me, please.
Thank you.

575
00:37:20,607 --> 00:37:22,609
(footsteps ascending stairs)

576
00:37:33,954 --> 00:37:37,257
(distant siren wails)

577
00:37:37,257 --> 00:37:39,860
(young man
groaning softly)

578
00:37:42,029 --> 00:37:44,031
You got to keep
your covers on, Bobby.

579
00:37:46,600 --> 00:37:49,870
(gentle orchestral music)

580
00:37:49,870 --> 00:37:51,004
(Bobby grunting softly)

581
00:38:01,648 --> 00:38:03,684
What is this, James?

582
00:38:05,686 --> 00:38:08,689
(Bobby grunting softly)

583
00:38:12,459 --> 00:38:14,928
This here
is Jesus Christ.

584
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:18,098
That's a cross.

585
00:38:19,299 --> 00:38:20,968
And this is the good book.

586
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,306
I'm studying to be a minister
'cause I believe in God.

587
00:38:29,510 --> 00:38:30,944
Who is this?

588
00:38:30,944 --> 00:38:32,913
Maybe my father.

589
00:38:34,214 --> 00:38:38,252
My father is, uh,
is a full-blooded
Cherokee Indian.

590
00:38:38,252 --> 00:38:39,520
He's strong.

591
00:38:41,088 --> 00:38:42,656
I'm gonna meet him.

592
00:38:44,124 --> 00:38:45,125
My father.

593
00:38:46,827 --> 00:38:47,828
Someday.

594
00:39:42,683 --> 00:39:47,020
(soft orchestral
music plays)

595
00:39:49,156 --> 00:39:51,258
Holy cow, sweetheart.
You scared the li--

596
00:39:51,258 --> 00:39:52,492
Where have you been, Bob?

597
00:39:52,492 --> 00:39:54,661
Where have I been?
You won't believe...

598
00:39:54,661 --> 00:39:56,396
I thought you had
another heart attack.

599
00:39:56,396 --> 00:39:57,764
You can't pick up a phone?

600
00:39:57,764 --> 00:39:59,533
No, no, there was
no phone where I was.

601
00:39:59,533 --> 00:40:00,767
You left your car
at the center.

602
00:40:00,767 --> 00:40:03,036
I found Dana at home.
She didn't know where you were.

603
00:40:03,036 --> 00:40:05,439
She said
you'd been fired.

604
00:40:05,439 --> 00:40:07,374
No, uh, I'm--
I'm being eased out.

605
00:40:07,374 --> 00:40:09,343
I'm being eased out.
I've got to find my own--

606
00:40:09,343 --> 00:40:11,645
I'm not the mother
of your son.

607
00:40:11,645 --> 00:40:14,648
I am not someone
who's been physically
or mentally challenged.

608
00:40:14,648 --> 00:40:17,017
So what am I?

609
00:40:17,017 --> 00:40:19,419
-What-- What are you?
-What am I?

610
00:40:19,419 --> 00:40:23,056
-What am I to you?
-You're my wife, Mary.

611
00:40:23,056 --> 00:40:25,092
I have a little piece of paper
that says that,

612
00:40:25,092 --> 00:40:26,994
but I don't feel
like your wife
or your partner.

613
00:40:26,994 --> 00:40:28,795
I feel like something
you scraped off your shoe.

614
00:40:28,795 --> 00:40:30,664
Mary, I'm-- I'm so--

615
00:40:30,664 --> 00:40:33,233
I'm-- I just realized
I'm beginning to--

616
00:40:33,233 --> 00:40:34,868
I mean, I'm out of it now,

617
00:40:34,868 --> 00:40:38,205
but I've-- I've-- I have
been going through...

618
00:40:38,205 --> 00:40:41,074
-a mid-life crisis.
-Midlife crisis?

619
00:40:41,074 --> 00:40:43,944
-Midlife.
-You're going
to live to 120?

620
00:40:43,944 --> 00:40:47,414
No, it's not a joke, Mary.
Look at me.

621
00:40:47,414 --> 00:40:49,917
Look at me.
Look at me fresh.

622
00:40:49,917 --> 00:40:53,420
I've been fired.
I'm out of there.

623
00:40:53,420 --> 00:40:54,922
I mean,
I have the one thing
to do with James,

624
00:40:54,922 --> 00:40:56,356
the fella who pulled me
out of the car.

625
00:40:56,356 --> 00:41:00,027
I owe it to him, and I--
I owe it to myself,
but-- but then it's...

626
00:41:00,027 --> 00:41:02,129
Goodbye, Geller.
Goodbye center.

627
00:41:02,129 --> 00:41:04,898
It's just you and me.
I love you, sweetheart.

628
00:41:04,898 --> 00:41:06,800
I love you, Mary.

629
00:41:08,202 --> 00:41:11,471
I don't want to go
along with this and find out
down the road it's the same.

630
00:41:11,471 --> 00:41:14,508
I don't want to wait.
I want to be with you now.

631
00:41:14,508 --> 00:41:19,813
Look, what-- what I've been
doing with James tonight,

632
00:41:19,813 --> 00:41:22,216
it's what I talked
to you about the other night.

633
00:41:22,216 --> 00:41:24,751
It's, uh...

634
00:41:24,751 --> 00:41:27,221
It's what
I started out doing.

635
00:41:27,221 --> 00:41:31,725
I mean, this--
this has just been--
it's been closure, you know?

636
00:41:31,725 --> 00:41:34,127
I'm wrapping up
the mess of my life,

637
00:41:34,127 --> 00:41:36,463
and I'm starting out again.

638
00:41:36,463 --> 00:41:38,932
Just you and me, fresh.

639
00:41:38,932 --> 00:41:42,236
I feel, Mary,
I feel like a bird.

640
00:41:42,236 --> 00:41:45,839
I feel like I'm-- I've never
felt like this in my life.

641
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,140
Oh, look at you.

642
00:41:48,408 --> 00:41:50,711
You're so pretty.

643
00:41:52,646 --> 00:41:54,948
Oh, Mary, I love you.

644
00:42:00,554 --> 00:42:03,724
(shears buzzing)

645
00:42:11,932 --> 00:42:14,735
Barber: Mm-hmm.
Oh, be with you in a sec.

646
00:42:14,735 --> 00:42:16,436
Grab a seat.

647
00:42:23,777 --> 00:42:26,246
Patron: Just...
very little.

648
00:42:33,754 --> 00:42:37,024
(ominous music)

649
00:42:37,991 --> 00:42:41,361
(James groaning softly)

650
00:42:41,361 --> 00:42:43,964
(scraping)

651
00:42:45,199 --> 00:42:47,167
(mutters)

652
00:42:48,569 --> 00:42:50,604
(James groaning softly)

653
00:42:50,604 --> 00:42:53,640
(breathing hard)

654
00:42:55,609 --> 00:42:57,744
(grunts)

655
00:42:57,744 --> 00:43:01,014
-(snipping)
-(buzzing)

656
00:43:07,554 --> 00:43:10,023
-(shouts)
-Man: Oh!

657
00:43:12,926 --> 00:43:15,696
-James!
-Man: Son of a gun.
You got me good, Ed.

658
00:43:15,696 --> 00:43:19,066
(seagulls calling,
distant siren)

659
00:43:34,047 --> 00:43:37,251
(breathing heavily)

660
00:43:37,251 --> 00:43:39,253
(church bell clanging)

661
00:43:44,157 --> 00:43:46,293
Well, we didn't get
very far in there, did we?

662
00:43:46,293 --> 00:43:49,496
(exhales)
I'm afraid.

663
00:43:50,597 --> 00:43:54,101
In the Bible,
Samson cut his hair
and he became weak.

664
00:43:54,101 --> 00:43:56,537
-I can't be weak.
-Will you trust me

665
00:43:56,537 --> 00:43:59,173
if I tell you that a haircut
will not make you weak?

666
00:43:59,173 --> 00:44:01,542
He had a razor.
He was gonna
shave off my beard!

667
00:44:01,542 --> 00:44:04,278
No, he was going
to trim your beard.
That was the idea.

668
00:44:04,278 --> 00:44:07,648
No, my beard...

669
00:44:07,648 --> 00:44:09,583
Great men have beards.

670
00:44:10,984 --> 00:44:14,588
(laughs)

671
00:44:14,588 --> 00:44:16,356
I'm not a great man, James.

672
00:44:16,356 --> 00:44:17,591
You are great.

673
00:44:17,591 --> 00:44:19,126
No, I wish I were,
but I'm not great.

674
00:44:19,126 --> 00:44:21,728
I'm just an ordinary fella.

675
00:44:23,630 --> 00:44:27,167
You remember when
you were yelling at me
about injustice?

676
00:44:27,167 --> 00:44:30,838
That I just let them
fire me? Remember?

677
00:44:30,838 --> 00:44:31,972
Well, you were right.

678
00:44:31,972 --> 00:44:35,576
I-I didn't put up a fight
because...

679
00:44:35,576 --> 00:44:40,414
with his fancy shirt and him
brimming over with confidence,

680
00:44:40,414 --> 00:44:43,383
he made me believe
that he had the right,

681
00:44:43,383 --> 00:44:46,119
that he had the--
the power

682
00:44:46,119 --> 00:44:48,822
to do whatever
he wanted with me.

683
00:44:48,822 --> 00:44:51,592
Fire me, whatever.
No matter.

684
00:44:52,793 --> 00:44:55,028
Then...

685
00:44:55,028 --> 00:44:57,331
you are not strong.

686
00:44:57,331 --> 00:45:00,300
No. Not always.

687
00:45:00,300 --> 00:45:02,135
But...

688
00:45:04,071 --> 00:45:07,674
That's how the world is, James.
If you don't...

689
00:45:07,674 --> 00:45:13,146
if you don't look like you
deserve a desk, you're not
going to get that desk.

690
00:45:20,754 --> 00:45:22,990
James:
Ah, it's too yellow.

691
00:45:26,994 --> 00:45:29,229
Too purple.
It's way too purple.

692
00:45:29,229 --> 00:45:31,465
This is really
difficult, James.

693
00:45:31,465 --> 00:45:33,734
Wait, wait. Wait.

694
00:45:33,734 --> 00:45:35,335
This one's for you,
Dr. Shushan.

695
00:45:35,335 --> 00:45:36,703
(laughs)

696
00:45:36,703 --> 00:45:37,905
James, why should I bother

697
00:45:37,905 --> 00:45:40,874
if you are not going
to take this seriously?

698
00:45:40,874 --> 00:45:42,643
-I am serious.
-No, you're not.

699
00:45:42,643 --> 00:45:45,445
Just look at this pile.

700
00:45:45,445 --> 00:45:47,781
-No suits.
-Suits?

701
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:51,151
-You wear a suit.
-My father wears a suit.

702
00:45:51,151 --> 00:45:53,453
-Great men wear suits.
-You don't need a suit.

703
00:45:53,453 --> 00:45:55,856
If we could just settle
on a shirt and a pair of pants.

704
00:45:55,856 --> 00:45:57,858
Suit.
Suits is important!

705
00:45:57,858 --> 00:45:59,092
James, you're
just being silly.

706
00:45:59,092 --> 00:46:00,561
I am trying to help you.

707
00:46:00,561 --> 00:46:02,162
(shouts)

708
00:46:06,066 --> 00:46:09,069
I don't need you to-- to--

709
00:46:09,069 --> 00:46:11,872
to help me walk
with a broom no reason!

710
00:46:11,872 --> 00:46:14,775
I don't-- I don't
need you to tell me to--

711
00:46:14,775 --> 00:46:17,377
to use soap for no reason!

712
00:46:18,679 --> 00:46:19,880
You don't--

713
00:46:22,416 --> 00:46:24,818
You don't know what I need.

714
00:46:26,320 --> 00:46:27,888
-You need a suit.
-No!

715
00:46:32,826 --> 00:46:34,795
I need my father.

716
00:46:37,698 --> 00:46:40,601
I want to-- I want to--
I want to stand up straight

717
00:46:40,601 --> 00:46:42,836
and wear a suit
when I see my father.

718
00:46:44,104 --> 00:46:47,875
Help me. Help me find
my father, Dr. Shushan.

719
00:46:47,875 --> 00:46:52,379
That is--
That is what I need.
That is all I want.

720
00:46:55,115 --> 00:46:56,250
That's all.

721
00:47:01,355 --> 00:47:04,057
James.

722
00:47:08,795 --> 00:47:11,465
Oh, James.

723
00:47:18,906 --> 00:47:20,908
(chair whirring)

724
00:47:23,777 --> 00:47:25,245
(gasps)

725
00:47:25,312 --> 00:47:28,482
(dentist drills buzzing)

726
00:47:31,518 --> 00:47:34,388
-James. James.
-Mm-hmm?

727
00:47:34,388 --> 00:47:37,724
Think about the desk.
The desk.

728
00:47:37,724 --> 00:47:41,195
Can you see it?
It's a fine desk.

729
00:47:41,195 --> 00:47:43,397
Wood. With drawers.

730
00:47:43,397 --> 00:47:45,933
You can put things in it.
Papers.

731
00:47:45,933 --> 00:47:49,837
And it's got a little tray.
Slides out.

732
00:47:49,837 --> 00:47:53,373
You can put
a typewriter on it.

733
00:47:53,373 --> 00:47:56,376
The desk, James.

734
00:47:56,376 --> 00:47:57,711
Picture the desk.

735
00:47:59,813 --> 00:48:01,849
Hi, Dana.

736
00:48:03,450 --> 00:48:05,185
Okay...

737
00:48:05,185 --> 00:48:07,921
(soft piano music)

738
00:48:53,600 --> 00:48:56,904
(laughs)

739
00:48:56,904 --> 00:48:58,572
Here you are, sir.

740
00:48:58,572 --> 00:49:01,241
(music continues)

741
00:49:04,211 --> 00:49:05,245
I dare ya.

742
00:49:16,523 --> 00:49:18,091
(crunch)

743
00:49:19,993 --> 00:49:23,197
(both laughing)

744
00:49:26,500 --> 00:49:28,936
-Teeth still in your mouth?
-(both laugh)

745
00:49:28,936 --> 00:49:30,871
We gotta get those plans
over to Ralph and Sophie

746
00:49:30,871 --> 00:49:32,339
so we can get going
on these estimates,

747
00:49:32,339 --> 00:49:33,707
'cause they
really wanna move.

748
00:49:33,707 --> 00:49:35,475
I'll get on it
right after lunch.

749
00:49:42,749 --> 00:49:44,685
Brian,
you all right?

750
00:49:44,685 --> 00:49:46,019
Yeah, you know,
I just remembered,

751
00:49:46,019 --> 00:49:48,155
I gotta return some--
some calls.

752
00:49:48,155 --> 00:49:50,157
Why don't you guys go ahead?
I'll catch up.

753
00:49:50,157 --> 00:49:51,258
-Okay?
-All right, man.

754
00:49:51,258 --> 00:49:52,793
-I'll be right there.
-Okay.

755
00:49:54,361 --> 00:49:57,764
(James laughing)

756
00:50:05,005 --> 00:50:07,241
(phone ringing)

757
00:50:12,913 --> 00:50:15,148
-Hello.
-Dr. Shushan?

758
00:50:15,148 --> 00:50:17,618
Rosalyn Flowers.
I hope you don't
mind my calling.

759
00:50:17,618 --> 00:50:19,219
I got your number
from James.

760
00:50:19,219 --> 00:50:20,654
Something wrong?

761
00:50:20,654 --> 00:50:23,290
I'd like to introduce you
to somebody.

762
00:50:23,290 --> 00:50:25,125
Somebody close to James.

763
00:50:25,125 --> 00:50:28,095
I think it's important
that you two talk.

764
00:50:28,095 --> 00:50:31,465
(choir singing)

765
00:50:31,465 --> 00:50:38,372
♪ Where my Savior died ♪

766
00:50:39,306 --> 00:50:44,378

767
00:50:44,378 --> 00:50:50,784

771
00:51:04,164 --> 00:51:06,667
-Dr. Shushan.
-Yes.

772
00:51:06,667 --> 00:51:08,602
I'm the pastor here.
Jessie Haynes.

773
00:51:08,602 --> 00:51:10,771
-(chuckles) How do you do?
-Will you sit with me?

774
00:51:10,771 --> 00:51:11,772
Of course.

775
00:51:17,578 --> 00:51:20,814
I've been hearing
a lot about you
from James these days.

776
00:51:20,814 --> 00:51:23,116
Quite a character,
isn't he?

777
00:51:23,116 --> 00:51:25,886
I've been working with him
for some time.

778
00:51:25,886 --> 00:51:28,522
You know, he has a goal
to be an ordained minister
one day.

779
00:51:28,522 --> 00:51:30,023
Yeah, he told me.

780
00:51:30,023 --> 00:51:33,193
I mean, he certainly has
a profound religious conviction.

781
00:51:33,193 --> 00:51:35,796
-Mm.
-Hope he's able
to realize it.

782
00:51:37,831 --> 00:51:39,933
During the course
of his training here,

783
00:51:39,933 --> 00:51:42,903
James would often speak
of finding his father.

784
00:51:42,903 --> 00:51:46,139
And then he stopped,
and I asked why.

785
00:51:47,508 --> 00:51:51,278
He seems to have found him,
and he's you.

786
00:51:54,948 --> 00:51:57,351
Oh, boy.
(sighs)

787
00:51:59,253 --> 00:52:00,587
Well...

788
00:52:00,587 --> 00:52:02,489
I-- I can't say
that I'm surprised.

789
00:52:02,489 --> 00:52:06,827
Certainly I--
I've-- I've never portrayed
myself as his father.

790
00:52:06,827 --> 00:52:09,162
He has a very
vivid imagination.

791
00:52:09,162 --> 00:52:12,032
But I think what
he's looking for

792
00:52:12,032 --> 00:52:14,468
maybe is a guide,
a mentor.

793
00:52:14,468 --> 00:52:16,603
I think
what he's looking for

794
00:52:16,603 --> 00:52:18,772
is someone to love.

795
00:52:18,772 --> 00:52:20,908
Someone to be
his family.

796
00:52:22,009 --> 00:52:24,945
I would hate
to see him hurt,
Dr. Shushan.

797
00:52:30,784 --> 00:52:32,786
(indistinct chatter)

798
00:52:34,621 --> 00:52:36,723
James.

799
00:52:36,723 --> 00:52:39,293
You wanna home with me
for supper tonight?

800
00:52:39,293 --> 00:52:43,363
Thought it might be a good idea
for you to meet my son.

801
00:52:44,364 --> 00:52:46,233
-Son?
-Yeah, my son Brian.

802
00:52:46,233 --> 00:52:49,870
He lives here in town
with his family.

803
00:52:49,870 --> 00:52:51,638
-He has his own family?
-Yeah.

804
00:52:51,638 --> 00:52:53,373
He's very busy.
I don't see much of him,

805
00:52:53,373 --> 00:52:54,942
but he's coming
to supper tonight,

806
00:52:54,942 --> 00:52:56,543
and I thought it might
be nice for you to join us.

807
00:52:56,543 --> 00:52:58,445
-Okay?
-All right.

808
00:52:58,445 --> 00:53:01,849
Okay.
I'll give you a lift back
to Mrs. Flowers'.

809
00:53:01,849 --> 00:53:03,450
You can put on
your new suit.

810
00:53:03,450 --> 00:53:05,619
-Okay.
-Okay.

811
00:53:11,959 --> 00:53:14,995
(silverware clinking softly)

812
00:53:27,841 --> 00:53:29,977
-(exhales)
-(clears throat)

813
00:53:36,416 --> 00:53:38,485
I hope Brian's all right.

814
00:53:38,485 --> 00:53:41,722
He probably
just got hung up at work.

815
00:53:41,722 --> 00:53:43,657
They've been
really busy there lately,

816
00:53:43,657 --> 00:53:45,025
and he likes to be there,
watching everything.

817
00:53:45,025 --> 00:53:47,227
I like these noodles!

818
00:53:47,227 --> 00:53:48,262
Bob: We're glad
you like the noodles.

819
00:53:48,262 --> 00:53:50,430
I'm eating like a--
like a supervisor.

820
00:53:50,430 --> 00:53:51,532
(laughter)

821
00:53:51,532 --> 00:53:52,733
James:
Better believe it.

822
00:53:52,733 --> 00:53:54,501
Would you pass
the bread please?

823
00:53:54,501 --> 00:53:56,003
Bread.

824
00:53:58,605 --> 00:54:00,374
Thank you.

825
00:54:00,374 --> 00:54:02,176
Please and thank you.
That's--

826
00:54:02,176 --> 00:54:03,377
That's good, young man.

827
00:54:03,377 --> 00:54:05,179
(James chuckles)

828
00:54:05,179 --> 00:54:07,848
Mrs. Flowers
would like you.
That's right.

829
00:54:07,848 --> 00:54:09,950
-(door opens, closes)
-Brian: Hello!

830
00:54:09,950 --> 00:54:12,753
Bob: Hey, the prodigal son.

831
00:54:13,921 --> 00:54:15,923
Ah. I'm sorry I'm late.

832
00:54:15,923 --> 00:54:17,291
We had a bunch
of change orders,

833
00:54:17,291 --> 00:54:18,358
and then the traffic
was crazy.

834
00:54:18,358 --> 00:54:19,560
-Hi, sweetheart.
-Hi, honey.

835
00:54:19,560 --> 00:54:21,862
Hey. Hey.
How's school?

836
00:54:21,862 --> 00:54:23,864
-Good.
-Good. Good.

837
00:54:23,864 --> 00:54:25,532
Bob:
Brian...

838
00:54:25,532 --> 00:54:27,568
Brian, this is James Jones.

839
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:29,570
James, this
is my son, Brian.

840
00:54:29,570 --> 00:54:32,606
-How do you do, James?
-I'm doing okay.

841
00:54:35,843 --> 00:54:38,312
Brian wants
to shake your hand, James.

842
00:54:41,715 --> 00:54:45,652
I, uh, I understand
you've been getting along
well with my father.

843
00:54:45,652 --> 00:54:47,821
You'll have to give me
some pointers.

844
00:54:47,821 --> 00:54:49,523
(laughter)

845
00:54:52,125 --> 00:54:53,193
(Brian chuckles)

846
00:54:54,761 --> 00:54:58,165
Uh, How long have you, uh,
been at the center, James?

847
00:55:01,468 --> 00:55:03,303
(clears throat loudly)

848
00:55:05,072 --> 00:55:08,976
James has been working
at the center for over
eight years, Brian.

849
00:55:08,976 --> 00:55:11,845
I just got
to know him recently,
and we've become friends.

850
00:55:11,845 --> 00:55:15,282
-Right, James?
-James is a hero.

851
00:55:15,282 --> 00:55:17,985
He saved Bob's life,
you know?

852
00:55:17,985 --> 00:55:19,586
Don't remind him.

853
00:55:19,586 --> 00:55:21,622
It's nice to see that--
that something good

854
00:55:21,622 --> 00:55:23,123
came out of such
a bad thing.

855
00:55:24,658 --> 00:55:26,860
James, what is it
that you do at the center?

856
00:55:26,860 --> 00:55:29,429
(breathes heavily)

857
00:55:29,429 --> 00:55:30,964
(groans softly)

858
00:55:30,964 --> 00:55:32,065
(clears throat)

859
00:55:35,002 --> 00:55:36,904
(James murmurs)

860
00:55:36,904 --> 00:55:39,573
-How come he doesn't
talk anymore?
-Shh.

861
00:55:39,573 --> 00:55:42,309
He doesn't have to say anything
if he doesn't want to do,
honey, okay?

862
00:55:42,309 --> 00:55:44,511
-You just eat. Okay?
-(groans softly)

863
00:55:47,714 --> 00:55:51,185
Maybe James doesn't
want to be on display.

864
00:55:51,185 --> 00:55:54,288
He's not on display, Brian.

865
00:55:57,057 --> 00:55:59,927
(whimpering softly)

866
00:56:09,136 --> 00:56:10,671
Those are James's new teeth,

867
00:56:10,671 --> 00:56:12,573
and they're--
they're probably un--

868
00:56:12,573 --> 00:56:14,641
Are they
uncomfortable, James?

869
00:56:14,641 --> 00:56:16,510
(chair clattering)

870
00:56:18,145 --> 00:56:19,813
It's okay.

871
00:56:25,919 --> 00:56:26,920
James!

872
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:32,426
Wait. Please. Stop!

873
00:56:35,529 --> 00:56:39,099
You... you've got a son!

874
00:56:39,099 --> 00:56:40,801
Yes, I do.

875
00:56:40,801 --> 00:56:45,339
A son with-- with a job,
a job with a desk!

876
00:56:45,339 --> 00:56:46,874
Yes. He does.

877
00:56:48,475 --> 00:56:50,444
A job with a desk.

878
00:56:51,478 --> 00:56:53,347
You must be...

879
00:56:55,048 --> 00:56:56,850
You must be very proud.

880
00:57:29,416 --> 00:57:31,051
Woman:
Hi, Sandra.

881
00:57:35,923 --> 00:57:37,758
-Well done.
-Hi.

882
00:57:59,746 --> 00:58:02,416
I need your signature
on this.

883
00:58:07,421 --> 00:58:09,389
It's been three days.
You think he's coming back?

884
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:14,361
No, he's...
down at his church.

885
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:16,964
Left his dentures
with the pastor.

886
00:58:16,964 --> 00:58:18,265
Gonna give him a call?

887
00:58:18,265 --> 00:58:20,934
No, I don't think James
wants to hear from me.

888
00:58:20,934 --> 00:58:23,170
(scoffs)
Well, he's just hurting.

889
00:58:23,170 --> 00:58:26,139
You just can't sit by.
It's not right.

890
00:58:27,641 --> 00:58:29,710
He needs you now
more than ever.

891
00:58:30,777 --> 00:58:32,412
Don't leave it
like this, Bob.

892
00:58:34,781 --> 00:58:39,753
♪ It's a highway
to heaven ♪

893
00:58:39,753 --> 00:58:42,689

(cheers and applause)

905
00:59:16,356 --> 00:59:17,357
Thanks.

906
00:59:18,692 --> 00:59:20,794
That was wonderful.

907
00:59:20,794 --> 00:59:22,062
You wanna come up, James?

908
00:59:27,734 --> 00:59:28,969
Take your time.

909
00:59:37,711 --> 00:59:40,080
(clears throat)

910
00:59:42,349 --> 00:59:44,618
We bow.

911
00:59:44,618 --> 00:59:47,521
To the glory of the Lord.

912
00:59:47,521 --> 00:59:50,057
-We are humble.
-(congregation agrees)

913
00:59:50,057 --> 00:59:51,892
We are all humble.

914
00:59:51,892 --> 00:59:54,428
Woman:
Amen, Lord.

915
00:59:54,428 --> 00:59:55,996
We take a breath...

916
00:59:58,031 --> 01:00:00,567
-...and he is there.
-Amen.

917
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,069
We make mistakes.

918
01:00:04,004 --> 01:00:07,407
Fall down.
And he is still there.

919
01:00:07,407 --> 01:00:08,942
Yeah.

920
01:00:08,942 --> 01:00:11,979
-We are all in his sights.
-Man: Amen.

921
01:00:11,979 --> 01:00:13,814
-We're all in his heart.
-Woman: Oh, yeah.

922
01:00:13,814 --> 01:00:15,148
Man: Amen.

923
01:00:15,148 --> 01:00:18,218
-Some of us are black.
-(murmurs of agreement)

924
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:21,421
-Some of us are white.
-(more murmurs of agreement)

925
01:00:21,421 --> 01:00:24,625
-Some of us are Cherokee.
-Woman: Amen.

926
01:00:24,625 --> 01:00:26,360
But in His eyes...

927
01:00:28,428 --> 01:00:29,663
We are one.

928
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:32,900
(cheers and applause)

929
01:00:38,939 --> 01:00:41,942
No matter what sad things...

930
01:00:43,477 --> 01:00:47,948
what bad things try to drag us
down to the ground...

931
01:00:49,483 --> 01:00:51,518
We can still look up.

932
01:00:53,420 --> 01:00:55,455
We can stand up straight,

933
01:00:55,455 --> 01:00:58,458
straight and tall,
and we will.

934
01:01:00,827 --> 01:01:05,566
For the love of God...
we will.

935
01:01:10,771 --> 01:01:12,272
-Amen.
-Amen!

936
01:01:12,272 --> 01:01:15,442
-Amen.
-(cheers and applause)

937
01:01:36,296 --> 01:01:38,765
(indistinct chatter)

938
01:01:46,740 --> 01:01:51,178
James, you're so much
more independent

939
01:01:51,178 --> 01:01:53,380
than I ever dreamt, James.

940
01:01:54,348 --> 01:01:59,319
You--
You spoke with the voice
of a supervisor up there.

941
01:01:59,319 --> 01:02:02,589
The voice God gave you
to make people listen.

942
01:02:04,091 --> 01:02:07,127
I was...
I was so proud.

943
01:02:09,463 --> 01:02:13,033
I'm-- I'm so sorry.

944
01:02:14,201 --> 01:02:15,769
I was thinking with my head.

945
01:02:15,769 --> 01:02:18,172
I wasn't thinking
with my heart

946
01:02:18,172 --> 01:02:20,174
when I invited you home
to supper.

947
01:02:20,174 --> 01:02:23,177
I thought maybe it might
make your path clearer

948
01:02:23,177 --> 01:02:25,412
if I introduced you
to my son--

949
01:02:25,412 --> 01:02:27,347
Find my father,
Dr. Shushan.

950
01:02:29,650 --> 01:02:32,352
I don't know whether I can
find your father, James.

951
01:02:32,352 --> 01:02:35,622
Try. That's what
you always say to me.

952
01:02:35,622 --> 01:02:40,394
I will try.
I will try with
everything I possibly can.

953
01:02:42,062 --> 01:02:43,530
Okay?

954
01:02:45,933 --> 01:02:47,701
A desk.

955
01:02:47,701 --> 01:02:51,238
(laughs)

956
01:02:51,238 --> 01:02:53,106
The barber?

957
01:02:53,106 --> 01:02:55,442
(James laughing)

958
01:02:56,977 --> 01:02:58,979
(both laughing)

959
01:03:10,557 --> 01:03:12,693
-Good morning!
-James.

960
01:03:13,627 --> 01:03:14,828
Here.

961
01:03:14,828 --> 01:03:16,129
What are these?

962
01:03:16,129 --> 01:03:20,067
Memos!
Supervisors give memos.

963
01:03:20,067 --> 01:03:21,768
What are they about?

964
01:03:21,768 --> 01:03:24,805
About things. Our parish.
The place is a mess!

965
01:03:24,805 --> 01:03:27,808
Got work to do, Dana!
Work to do!

966
01:03:35,983 --> 01:03:36,984
(sighs)

967
01:03:51,031 --> 01:03:52,833
Regulation FBI.

968
01:03:58,172 --> 01:03:59,306
(clears throat)

969
01:04:09,283 --> 01:04:12,152
Woman 1:
James got his hair cut.

970
01:04:12,152 --> 01:04:14,488
Woman 2: I love your hair,
James.

971
01:04:16,156 --> 01:04:18,358
Woman 3: It's better
like he is now.

972
01:04:24,131 --> 01:04:25,599
Oh, take a look at James.

973
01:04:25,599 --> 01:04:26,834
Woman: Yeah.

974
01:04:34,474 --> 01:04:36,176
(clattering)

975
01:04:43,083 --> 01:04:45,452
I'll be, uh, out of the way
in a minute.

976
01:04:45,452 --> 01:04:48,088
You, uh,
you take your time.

977
01:04:49,323 --> 01:04:52,492
I take my time.
I'm out of a job.

978
01:04:52,492 --> 01:04:54,094
Can't forget things,
though.

979
01:04:54,094 --> 01:04:55,662
Oh, don't worry
about that.

980
01:04:55,662 --> 01:04:57,096
I could do this route
in my sleep.

981
01:05:01,702 --> 01:05:03,303
Okay, that's it.

982
01:05:03,303 --> 01:05:05,038
I'll see you
in two weeks.

983
01:05:05,038 --> 01:05:07,875
Oh, you gotta be more careful.
Gotta take your time.

984
01:05:08,742 --> 01:05:10,444
Excuse me?

985
01:05:12,379 --> 01:05:15,849
Paper towels and toilet paper
are still in the truck.

986
01:05:17,284 --> 01:05:18,886
The list.
Go ahead. Check the list.

987
01:05:24,358 --> 01:05:26,326
By golly, you're right.

988
01:05:26,326 --> 01:05:27,528
Double order.
I didn't even notice.

989
01:05:30,397 --> 01:05:31,698
Well, okay.

990
01:05:31,698 --> 01:05:33,233
Good to have someone
around to keep me honest.

991
01:05:34,568 --> 01:05:36,370
(laughs)

992
01:05:43,944 --> 01:05:46,880
(sighs)
Trying to find a Gordon Jones
without an address.

993
01:05:46,880 --> 01:05:48,982
This is one hell
of a haystack.

994
01:05:48,982 --> 01:05:51,151
Well, we'll get somebody,
we'll ask him...

995
01:05:51,151 --> 01:05:53,720
He was in the Air Force.
He went to Japan...

996
01:05:53,720 --> 01:05:56,089
Oh, he's not Caucasian.
He's Cherokee.

997
01:05:56,089 --> 01:05:58,058
Yes, he's 1/16th Cherokee.

998
01:05:58,058 --> 01:06:00,294
Oh, James said his father
was a chief.

999
01:06:00,294 --> 01:06:03,263
(laughing)
1/16th chief.

1000
01:06:03,263 --> 01:06:06,066
-James: See what
I'm talking about?
-Right.

1001
01:06:06,066 --> 01:06:08,335
This outlet over here.

1002
01:06:09,603 --> 01:06:11,138
Sparks came
out of it once.

1003
01:06:11,138 --> 01:06:12,906
Really?

1004
01:06:12,906 --> 01:06:14,241
Follow me.
Th-The bathroom.

1005
01:06:14,241 --> 01:06:16,043
There's a million things
wrong in the bathroom.

1006
01:06:16,043 --> 01:06:19,112
...69-1680.

1007
01:06:25,152 --> 01:06:26,653
Yes.

1008
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:29,890
Yes. I'd like to speak
to a Gordon Jones, please.

1009
01:06:29,890 --> 01:06:31,458
Oh, he isn't? No.

1010
01:06:31,458 --> 01:06:34,828
Nothing, like looking
through a thousand
death certificates

1011
01:06:34,828 --> 01:06:36,196
to cheer up your day.

1012
01:06:36,196 --> 01:06:38,398
Well, you can add two more
with our names to the list.

1013
01:06:38,398 --> 01:06:39,566
What's this?

1014
01:06:39,566 --> 01:06:42,169
James Jones has reported
to the city inspector, no less,

1015
01:06:42,169 --> 01:06:46,607
$7,500 worth of repairs
that have to be done now!

1016
01:06:46,607 --> 01:06:47,975
Well, I'm glad
you find this so amusing.

1017
01:06:47,975 --> 01:06:50,310
I'm sure you can get
the board just to chortle
about it as well.

1018
01:06:50,310 --> 01:06:52,913
Well, you have to admit,
he's doing his job.

1019
01:06:52,913 --> 01:06:54,915
Get him to stop the memos.

1020
01:06:54,915 --> 01:06:57,217
(telephone rings)

1021
01:06:58,986 --> 01:07:00,087
Shushan.

1022
01:07:02,890 --> 01:07:04,191
Now?

1023
01:07:04,191 --> 01:07:06,193
(indistinct chatter)

1024
01:07:10,330 --> 01:07:12,900
Whoa.
You wanted to see me?

1025
01:07:14,301 --> 01:07:15,969
Yes, Bob.
Come on in.

1026
01:07:19,173 --> 01:07:20,207
Hi, George.

1027
01:07:21,341 --> 01:07:24,444
We asked you to find
your replacement, and, uh...

1028
01:07:24,444 --> 01:07:26,480
you obviously
haven't done it.

1029
01:07:26,480 --> 01:07:28,715
Well, I knew
you were looking.

1030
01:07:28,715 --> 01:07:30,317
It just seemed better
you make the choice.

1031
01:07:30,317 --> 01:07:32,519
Anybody can do this job.

1032
01:07:32,519 --> 01:07:35,556
Just need to get
a hard-working paper pusher

1033
01:07:35,556 --> 01:07:38,592
with a half-decent heart,
and Dana'll do the rest.

1034
01:07:40,394 --> 01:07:42,496
Dr. Shushan!

1035
01:07:44,798 --> 01:07:46,600
I need to find
Dr. Shushan.

1036
01:07:46,600 --> 01:07:48,869
Now's not a good time,
James.

1037
01:07:48,869 --> 01:07:50,237
-Where is he?
-Well, he's--

1038
01:07:50,237 --> 01:07:51,705
he's meeting
with Mr. Geller.

1039
01:07:51,705 --> 01:07:55,042
He'll be back
in a while, okay?

1040
01:07:55,042 --> 01:07:57,578
(exhales)

1041
01:07:58,812 --> 01:08:01,648
You've tried
our patience, Bob.

1042
01:08:01,648 --> 01:08:05,219
It's our estimation
that you've shirked your
day-to-day responsibilities.

1043
01:08:05,219 --> 01:08:06,787
Oh, no,
I don't think so.

1044
01:08:06,787 --> 01:08:09,223
I think I have just
become aware of them.

1045
01:08:09,223 --> 01:08:12,259
James Jones
is parading around here
like some sort of supervisor.

1046
01:08:12,259 --> 01:08:14,761
He's working very hard.
He's very proud.

1047
01:08:14,761 --> 01:08:17,430
You have allowed him to incur
thousands of dollars of debt,

1048
01:08:17,430 --> 01:08:19,131
which the center
must now pay.

1049
01:08:19,131 --> 01:08:20,567
(chuckling)
Come on.

1050
01:08:20,567 --> 01:08:23,403
Those are repairs that should
have been made ages ago.

1051
01:08:24,371 --> 01:08:26,372
I knew you'd have
your rationale.

1052
01:08:26,372 --> 01:08:28,774
This board asked
only one thing of you,

1053
01:08:28,774 --> 01:08:31,245
and that was to find a director
to carry on in your footsteps,

1054
01:08:31,245 --> 01:08:32,880
and you failed us.

1055
01:08:32,880 --> 01:08:37,084
While squandering your time
on some... escapade.

1056
01:08:37,084 --> 01:08:40,754
You forced my hand, Bob.
We found your replacement.

1057
01:08:40,754 --> 01:08:43,023
Well...

1058
01:08:43,023 --> 01:08:45,225
You're finished.

1059
01:08:50,297 --> 01:08:53,367
Geller: All right,
let's turn to page 23
of the fiscal budget...

1060
01:08:56,236 --> 01:08:58,238
(dramatic music)

1061
01:09:08,015 --> 01:09:09,015
Woman: There.

1062
01:09:11,184 --> 01:09:12,653
James.

1063
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,388
What are you doing?

1064
01:09:16,690 --> 01:09:18,992
Take it back, Dr. Shushan.

1065
01:09:18,992 --> 01:09:20,827
What's the matter, James?

1066
01:09:20,827 --> 01:09:22,763
No, take it back.
I don't want this desk no more.

1067
01:09:22,763 --> 01:09:25,899
-Why?
-It got you fired.

1068
01:09:25,899 --> 01:09:27,501
I got you fired.

1069
01:09:27,501 --> 01:09:31,805
I was already fired, James,
and this-- this desk is yours.

1070
01:09:31,805 --> 01:09:35,142
You've earned it.
You keep it.

1071
01:09:35,142 --> 01:09:37,877
My leaving the center...

1072
01:09:37,877 --> 01:09:41,215
that's all part of
the great destiny, isn't it?

1073
01:09:41,215 --> 01:09:42,816
But the-- the inspector.

1074
01:09:42,816 --> 01:09:45,018
"The inspector."

1075
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:47,020
Let me tell you
something, James.

1076
01:09:48,889 --> 01:09:53,126
You did the right thing.
You do the right thing.

1077
01:09:53,126 --> 01:09:57,164
You've taught me things,
James.

1078
01:09:57,164 --> 01:09:59,266
-Me?
-Yeah, you.

1079
01:10:01,301 --> 01:10:03,637
I stood up straight today.

1080
01:10:03,637 --> 01:10:07,074
(both laughing)

1081
01:10:07,074 --> 01:10:10,344
I just wish that...

1082
01:10:10,344 --> 01:10:12,546
We're trying
to find your father.

1083
01:10:12,546 --> 01:10:15,082
We're looking for him.

1084
01:10:15,082 --> 01:10:16,984
I don't know whether
we're going to have any luck.

1085
01:10:16,984 --> 01:10:19,186
I don't even know for sure
whether he's still alive.

1086
01:10:19,186 --> 01:10:22,589
Don't say that,
Dr. Shushan!

1087
01:10:22,589 --> 01:10:24,825
He's out there.
I know he's out there.

1088
01:10:24,825 --> 01:10:28,996
Okay. Okay.
Then we'll keep looking.

1089
01:10:31,098 --> 01:10:33,867
It's late, you want me
to give you a lift home?

1090
01:10:35,636 --> 01:10:38,605
No... I'm gonna
finish my work.

1091
01:10:41,408 --> 01:10:42,509
Good night, James.

1092
01:10:42,509 --> 01:10:44,411
You stood up straight
today, huh?

1093
01:10:44,411 --> 01:10:46,213
-Yeah.
-(laughter)

1094
01:10:48,182 --> 01:10:50,884
Give me five,
Dr. Shushan.

1095
01:10:52,886 --> 01:10:54,955
Okay. Okay, everybody,

1096
01:10:54,955 --> 01:10:57,891
let's get this desk back
where it belongs, okay?

1097
01:10:57,891 --> 01:11:00,160
-All: Okay!
-Good night, James.

1098
01:11:01,695 --> 01:11:03,497
Good night, Dr. Shushan.

1099
01:11:05,532 --> 01:11:06,867
Good night,
everybody.

1100
01:11:06,867 --> 01:11:09,136
All: Good night!
Good night, Dr. Shusen.

1101
01:11:11,738 --> 01:11:13,440
(desk squeaking on floor)

1102
01:11:16,276 --> 01:11:18,478
(phone ringing)

1103
01:11:22,616 --> 01:11:23,517
(phone beeps)

1104
01:11:24,384 --> 01:11:25,385
Mary:
Hello?

1105
01:11:26,854 --> 01:11:29,056
Oh. Uh, Yeah.

1106
01:11:29,056 --> 01:11:30,924
Hold on a second, please.

1107
01:11:30,924 --> 01:11:34,862
Honey. Someone says
that he's Gordon Jones.

1108
01:11:35,596 --> 01:11:37,431
-Hello?
-(Mary grunts)

1109
01:11:50,110 --> 01:11:53,046
(seagulls calling)

1110
01:12:05,058 --> 01:12:07,961
I'm looking
for Gordon Jones.

1111
01:12:09,129 --> 01:12:10,497
He's down there.

1112
01:12:14,635 --> 01:12:17,971
(pot clattering,
water running)

1113
01:12:19,673 --> 01:12:21,375
Mr. Jones?

1114
01:12:24,311 --> 01:12:25,879
I'm Bob Shushan.

1115
01:12:39,059 --> 01:12:40,961
You know my son.

1116
01:12:40,961 --> 01:12:42,296
Yes, I do.

1117
01:12:45,432 --> 01:12:47,034
Why are you
looking for me?

1118
01:12:47,034 --> 01:12:50,204
(chuckles) He asked me
to find his father.

1119
01:12:52,306 --> 01:12:53,674
He asked?

1120
01:12:54,808 --> 01:12:56,343
(sighs)

1121
01:12:56,343 --> 01:12:59,613
You went through
a lot of trouble to find me.

1122
01:12:59,613 --> 01:13:02,316
I don't get it.
What's everybody want?

1123
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:06,553
James is a good man,
Mr. Jones.

1124
01:13:06,553 --> 01:13:09,156
He made his way
the best he could.

1125
01:13:09,156 --> 01:13:10,757
He doesn't want anything.

1126
01:13:10,757 --> 01:13:12,793
Anything except...

1127
01:13:12,793 --> 01:13:14,595
Well, I was going
to say love.

1128
01:13:14,595 --> 01:13:18,031
Uh, I don't think he wants
anything except his father.

1129
01:13:18,031 --> 01:13:21,301
You-- Do you think you're
able to give them that?

1130
01:13:23,570 --> 01:13:25,839
I don't Why
he doesn't hate me.

1131
01:13:25,839 --> 01:13:26,840
(chuckles)

1132
01:13:26,840 --> 01:13:28,575
He doesn't hate you.

1133
01:13:28,575 --> 01:13:31,577
He loves you...
unequivocally.

1134
01:13:41,989 --> 01:13:43,357
How is he?

1135
01:13:45,325 --> 01:13:47,895
Oh, th-that's a long story.

1136
01:13:47,895 --> 01:13:51,331
Do you have somewhere
we could sit and talk?

1137
01:13:52,332 --> 01:13:54,234
We brought him home.

1138
01:13:55,636 --> 01:13:58,205
You can't tell much
with a baby,

1139
01:13:58,205 --> 01:14:00,641
but he wasn't right.

1140
01:14:00,641 --> 01:14:02,776
When he was two,
he grabbed hold

1141
01:14:02,776 --> 01:14:07,548
of a hot oven rack...
and he didn't feel a thing.

1142
01:14:08,682 --> 01:14:10,484
Just wasn't right.

1143
01:14:12,052 --> 01:14:14,087
My wife left.

1144
01:14:14,087 --> 01:14:17,191
Took the other kids
and left James with me.

1145
01:14:19,793 --> 01:14:21,795
I did the best I could.

1146
01:14:22,596 --> 01:14:25,332
Back in those days,
there was nobody to go to,

1147
01:14:25,332 --> 01:14:27,000
nobody to ask for help.

1148
01:14:29,002 --> 01:14:32,005
Even if he was like
a regular kid...

1149
01:14:32,005 --> 01:14:33,574
there was no way.

1150
01:14:36,243 --> 01:14:37,577
Look at me now.

1151
01:14:41,315 --> 01:14:42,916
It's all I know how to do.

1152
01:14:46,452 --> 01:14:49,256
What kind of father
would I have been?

1153
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:56,663
You think I did
the wrong thing, don't you?

1154
01:14:59,933 --> 01:15:02,503
(chuckles)

1155
01:15:02,503 --> 01:15:05,305
(sighs)

1156
01:15:05,305 --> 01:15:06,907
I'm probably
the last man in the world

1157
01:15:06,907 --> 01:15:09,076
to be the judge
of that, Mr. Jones.

1158
01:15:12,212 --> 01:15:13,547
(Jones sighs)

1159
01:15:13,547 --> 01:15:16,850
The whole thing
takes courage, doesn't it?

1160
01:15:18,252 --> 01:15:19,853
Bob: Oh, it sure does,
Mr. Jones.

1161
01:15:19,853 --> 01:15:21,755
It sure does.

1162
01:15:39,206 --> 01:15:40,440
James.

1163
01:15:41,742 --> 01:15:42,910
(sighs)

1164
01:15:45,746 --> 01:15:46,747
We found him.

1165
01:15:47,915 --> 01:15:51,919
Your father.
He's here, living in this city.

1166
01:15:54,321 --> 01:15:55,622
(exhales sharply)

1167
01:16:00,494 --> 01:16:02,062
Well, I have--
I have to see him!

1168
01:16:02,062 --> 01:16:03,664
Take me to him.
Take me to him now!

1169
01:16:03,664 --> 01:16:05,299
No, no, no.
Hang on a second.

1170
01:16:05,299 --> 01:16:06,867
You and me,
we have to talk first.

1171
01:16:06,867 --> 01:16:08,202
No, no, no,
we have to see him!

1172
01:16:08,202 --> 01:16:10,237
We have to call him,
and then we have to--

1173
01:16:10,237 --> 01:16:12,372
He doesn't have a telephone.

1174
01:16:12,372 --> 01:16:15,542
He doesn't have a desk job.
Doesn't have a car.

1175
01:16:15,542 --> 01:16:16,643
He's a dishwasher.

1176
01:16:16,643 --> 01:16:19,146
He doesn't have
much of anything.

1177
01:16:20,380 --> 01:16:22,816
Does he, uh...
does he have a beard?

1178
01:16:22,816 --> 01:16:25,586
(chuckles)
No, he doesn't even
have a beard.

1179
01:16:25,586 --> 01:16:29,056
But he has a son.
That son is you.

1180
01:16:29,056 --> 01:16:31,491
(both laughing)

1181
01:16:31,491 --> 01:16:32,593
Come here.

1182
01:16:35,495 --> 01:16:36,997
(James chuckling)

1183
01:16:38,732 --> 01:16:40,968
Ah, God. We found him.

1184
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:42,236
(laughing)

1185
01:16:43,537 --> 01:16:46,773
Dr. Shushan. Uh...

1186
01:16:46,773 --> 01:16:49,109
Your son, Brian,
he should be there.

1187
01:16:49,109 --> 01:16:50,978
He should be there when
I meet my father,

1188
01:16:50,978 --> 01:16:53,814
so that-- so that...

1189
01:16:53,814 --> 01:16:56,683
So that you're not alone
when-- when I leave you.

1190
01:17:01,021 --> 01:17:02,489
James...

1191
01:17:04,391 --> 01:17:07,995
I haven't been
much of a father to my son.

1192
01:17:09,530 --> 01:17:10,898
He can forgive you.

1193
01:17:10,898 --> 01:17:12,733
I don't know.

1194
01:17:12,733 --> 01:17:14,568
Dr. Shushan...

1195
01:17:14,568 --> 01:17:17,337
the son has feelings
for his father that never die.

1196
01:17:17,337 --> 01:17:18,739
Never!

1197
01:17:18,739 --> 01:17:20,807
That kind of love
is forever.

1198
01:17:20,807 --> 01:17:23,243
He's-- he's waiting
to see you,

1199
01:17:23,243 --> 01:17:25,979
just like I'm-- just like
I'm waiting to see my father.

1200
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:27,881
(chuckles)

1201
01:17:33,720 --> 01:17:35,589
(phone ringing,
indistinct chatter)

1202
01:17:35,589 --> 01:17:36,657
Brian: That's fine,
it looks great.

1203
01:17:36,657 --> 01:17:38,392
Just make sure that we have
a model, 'cause I know

1204
01:17:38,392 --> 01:17:39,626
that they need this
by Thursday.

1205
01:17:39,626 --> 01:17:43,597
(indistinct chatter)

1206
01:17:46,633 --> 01:17:47,467
(chuckles)

1207
01:17:47,467 --> 01:17:50,103
Just joking.
You wanna to come get some air?

1208
01:17:52,239 --> 01:17:55,909
Uh, why? Dad, this is--
this is not a good time.

1209
01:17:56,844 --> 01:17:59,746
Well, you sound
just like me.
Five minutes.

1210
01:17:59,746 --> 01:18:01,582
(traffic noise)

1211
01:18:07,554 --> 01:18:08,822
I don't quite
know how to begin.

1212
01:18:08,822 --> 01:18:10,757
Dad, you-- you don't
have to do this.

1213
01:18:10,757 --> 01:18:12,559
Yes, I do.

1214
01:18:12,559 --> 01:18:14,728
This, uh, father-son thing.

1215
01:18:14,728 --> 01:18:17,798
It seems to be
something that...

1216
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:20,133
doesn't give up
very easily.

1217
01:18:20,133 --> 01:18:21,134
Well, here we are.

1218
01:18:21,134 --> 01:18:22,636
(chuckles)
Yeah, here we are.

1219
01:18:22,636 --> 01:18:25,806
James, he wants his father
so much that nothing,

1220
01:18:25,806 --> 01:18:29,710
no amount of hurt,
is going to get in his way.

1221
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:32,179
And we found him,
and we've, uh,

1222
01:18:32,179 --> 01:18:35,182
set up a reunion
between the two of them.

1223
01:18:36,650 --> 01:18:39,386
There's the address.
He wants you to be there.

1224
01:18:42,289 --> 01:18:45,125
He just, he, uh...

1225
01:18:45,125 --> 01:18:46,994
he doesn't want
to leave me alone

1226
01:18:46,994 --> 01:18:49,196
without a... pfft...

1227
01:18:49,196 --> 01:18:50,764
H-He has no understanding

1228
01:18:50,764 --> 01:18:52,900
of the kind of problems
that we have.

1229
01:18:52,900 --> 01:18:54,835
Well, he never really
knew his father.

1230
01:18:56,202 --> 01:18:58,772
-That makes it easier?
-Yeah, I think it makes it
a lot easier.

1231
01:18:58,772 --> 01:19:00,507
It's a fantasy.
It's not real.

1232
01:19:03,510 --> 01:19:06,446
How can we undo this?
Oh, Dad, why are you doing this?

1233
01:19:06,446 --> 01:19:08,815
You can't undo it.
It's done!

1234
01:19:08,815 --> 01:19:11,151
I didn't have a father.

1235
01:19:13,086 --> 01:19:15,088
Look, I know you want
to be that person,

1236
01:19:15,088 --> 01:19:16,723
but you're not.

1237
01:19:16,723 --> 01:19:19,059
You never have been,
because you chose

1238
01:19:19,059 --> 01:19:20,127
to keep yourself apart..

1239
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:22,529
You weren't there
in the morning when I woke up.

1240
01:19:22,529 --> 01:19:25,098
You-- You came home
after I went to bed.

1241
01:19:25,098 --> 01:19:26,099
You...

1242
01:19:27,835 --> 01:19:29,002
You left me alone.

1243
01:19:29,002 --> 01:19:30,671
I don't know what
I was thinking, I don't--

1244
01:19:30,671 --> 01:19:32,039
Well, I don't either.

1245
01:19:32,039 --> 01:19:34,273
Brian, Wait a minute.
Come here. Come here, please.

1246
01:19:34,273 --> 01:19:37,244
Just-- just--
just for a second, just...

1247
01:19:37,244 --> 01:19:39,513
(exhales)
Please, come here. Come here.

1248
01:19:43,416 --> 01:19:46,353
My whole life...
has been wrong.

1249
01:19:46,353 --> 01:19:48,255
Wrong.
(chuckles) All of it.

1250
01:19:48,255 --> 01:19:49,156
I mean, it was...

1251
01:19:50,424 --> 01:19:54,561
I mean, it's easy
to blame it on the work.

1252
01:19:54,561 --> 01:19:56,129
But I wasn't even
doing the work

1253
01:19:56,129 --> 01:19:57,331
I was supposed to do.

1254
01:19:57,331 --> 01:19:59,233
I had-- I had
my head in the sand

1255
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:02,236
like a damn ostrich.

1256
01:20:02,236 --> 01:20:05,272
I mean, I was afraid
of... risk.

1257
01:20:05,272 --> 01:20:08,208
I was afraid of confrontation.
I was afraid of adventure.

1258
01:20:08,208 --> 01:20:11,278
I was afraid of love.
I was afraid to love you.

1259
01:20:11,278 --> 01:20:13,747
I was-- I was afraid
to love me.

1260
01:20:22,222 --> 01:20:23,991
I-I'm sorry.

1261
01:20:28,929 --> 01:20:31,431
(distant seagulls calling)

1262
01:20:34,334 --> 01:20:35,702
I'm sorry, too.

1263
01:20:45,245 --> 01:20:47,614
You better get yourself
back to work.

1264
01:20:49,983 --> 01:20:51,351
Yeah, I gotta go.

1265
01:21:04,932 --> 01:21:07,234
I should have said
thank you.

1266
01:21:08,802 --> 01:21:10,404
I should have said that.

1267
01:21:11,572 --> 01:21:12,706
If I'd been...

1268
01:21:23,150 --> 01:21:25,686
(indistinct chatter on TV)

1269
01:21:26,820 --> 01:21:29,356
(sighs) He's been locked
in his room all morning.

1270
01:21:29,356 --> 01:21:30,958
He says he'll be down soon.

1271
01:21:30,958 --> 01:21:32,925
(chuckles)
Okay.

1272
01:21:32,925 --> 01:21:34,161
I have butterflies.

1273
01:21:34,161 --> 01:21:35,596
(chuckling)
Me, too.

1274
01:21:35,596 --> 01:21:37,197
(footsteps)

1275
01:21:38,565 --> 01:21:40,601
My Lord!

1276
01:21:40,601 --> 01:21:43,403
Bob: Holy cow.

1277
01:21:43,403 --> 01:21:44,872
I'd have shaved
that beard myself

1278
01:21:44,872 --> 01:21:48,208
if I knew you were
so handsome, James.

1279
01:21:48,208 --> 01:21:49,443
(applause)

1280
01:21:51,712 --> 01:21:53,814
James, you moving out
already?

1281
01:21:53,814 --> 01:21:55,215
My father and me
will live--

1282
01:21:55,215 --> 01:21:58,385
Now, let's just take it
one step at a time,

1283
01:21:58,385 --> 01:22:00,521
if you please.

1284
01:22:00,521 --> 01:22:02,723
Today, you meet
your father.

1285
01:22:02,723 --> 01:22:04,023
That's today.

1286
01:22:05,392 --> 01:22:08,695
I'll take this,
put it in your closet.

1287
01:22:08,695 --> 01:22:10,631
Keep it packed,
ready to go.

1288
01:22:11,465 --> 01:22:13,934
So when that day comes...

1289
01:22:13,934 --> 01:22:15,869
it'll be there.

1290
01:22:15,869 --> 01:22:17,104
-Understand?
-(James sniffles)

1291
01:22:21,008 --> 01:22:23,076
Thank you.
Thank you Mrs. Flowers.

1292
01:22:23,076 --> 01:22:25,646
(both chuckling)

1293
01:22:25,646 --> 01:22:26,847
Now you go on, now.

1294
01:22:26,847 --> 01:22:28,382
You don't want
to be late.

1295
01:22:28,382 --> 01:22:30,684
I don't want my father to...

1296
01:22:30,684 --> 01:22:32,419
to be the only one
without a beard.

1297
01:22:32,419 --> 01:22:33,754
(Bob chuckles)

1298
01:22:33,754 --> 01:22:35,222
I'll be there
in a second, James.

1299
01:22:35,222 --> 01:22:36,557
Bye-bye, James!

1300
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:38,759
Man: Bye, James.

1301
01:22:42,029 --> 01:22:43,497
Thank you.

1302
01:22:43,497 --> 01:22:45,398
Thank you, Dr. Shushan.

1303
01:22:46,433 --> 01:22:48,502
(chuckles)

1304
01:22:56,276 --> 01:22:59,513
(light instrumental music)

1305
01:22:59,513 --> 01:23:01,782
(children playing)

1306
01:23:12,459 --> 01:23:14,127
It's still early, James.

1307
01:23:15,529 --> 01:23:16,763
James: Still early.

1308
01:23:23,403 --> 01:23:25,105
(chuckles)

1309
01:23:33,180 --> 01:23:34,715
I am...

1310
01:23:34,715 --> 01:23:36,550
I am happy you are here.

1311
01:23:36,550 --> 01:23:39,052
(chuckling)
Thanks. Thank you, James.

1312
01:23:39,052 --> 01:23:41,822
Because now, when--
when I leave your father,

1313
01:23:41,822 --> 01:23:43,490
he won't be alone.

1314
01:23:48,662 --> 01:23:51,164
Your father
is a great man!

1315
01:23:52,099 --> 01:23:53,600
You should grow a beard.

1316
01:23:54,934 --> 01:23:55,969
(chuckling)

1317
01:24:05,546 --> 01:24:06,647
I thought about it.

1318
01:24:08,749 --> 01:24:10,217
Finding a father
seemed to be

1319
01:24:10,217 --> 01:24:12,686
an important thing
to be a part of.

1320
01:24:14,688 --> 01:24:16,023
Dr. Shushan.

1321
01:24:17,023 --> 01:24:18,025
Doctor Shushan.

1322
01:24:19,393 --> 01:24:21,161
That's him, James...

1323
01:24:21,161 --> 01:24:22,663
That's your father.

1324
01:24:26,500 --> 01:24:27,568
He's not a...

1325
01:24:27,568 --> 01:24:29,303
He's not
an Indian chief.

1326
01:24:31,538 --> 01:24:33,907
And he doesn't
have a desk.

1327
01:24:36,677 --> 01:24:38,145
But he is a great man.

1328
01:24:39,179 --> 01:24:40,514
To me.

1329
01:24:42,349 --> 01:24:43,916
Because he is my father.

1330
01:24:43,916 --> 01:24:45,786
Go tell him that.

1331
01:24:48,622 --> 01:24:49,623
My father.

1332
01:24:58,432 --> 01:25:00,067
James?

1333
01:25:00,067 --> 01:25:02,369
Damn you, Dad.

1334
01:25:02,369 --> 01:25:04,304
(laughing)

1335
01:25:04,304 --> 01:25:06,306
(dramatic music)

1336
01:25:13,380 --> 01:25:15,916
(Gordon crying)

1337
01:25:20,687 --> 01:25:22,956
(both crying)

1338
01:25:22,956 --> 01:25:25,259
Ohh. Look at ya.

1339
01:25:25,259 --> 01:25:26,994
You look like
an executive.

1340
01:25:26,994 --> 01:25:28,362
(James laughing)

1341
01:25:39,573 --> 01:25:42,409
Come on...

1342
01:25:42,409 --> 01:25:44,745
Kim: Come say hello
to Grandma.

1343
01:25:44,745 --> 01:25:47,214
-Mary: Look at you.
-Kim: Oh, look.

1344
01:25:47,214 --> 01:25:49,416
-(baby cooing)
-Mary: Hello, beauty.

1345
01:25:49,416 --> 01:25:53,452
-Hello. Ohh.
-(Kim laughing)

1346
01:25:53,452 --> 01:25:55,923
(baby cooing)

1347
01:25:55,923 --> 01:25:57,724
-(chuckles)
-Kim: Oh, it's fine.

1348
01:26:00,561 --> 01:26:03,096
Is this most beautiful child
you've ever seen?

1349
01:26:04,164 --> 01:26:06,666
You look beautiful.

1350
01:26:06,666 --> 01:26:09,436
(baby cooing)

1351
01:26:09,436 --> 01:26:10,537
Thank you.

1352
01:26:13,373 --> 01:26:14,975
Very beautiful.

1353
01:26:37,331 --> 01:26:39,066
(sighs)

1354
01:26:40,367 --> 01:26:42,536
I know how
it feels, Avery.

1355
01:26:42,536 --> 01:26:47,040
Young guy swoops in,
everybody makes a big fuss.

1356
01:26:47,040 --> 01:26:48,375
What does he know?

1357
01:26:48,375 --> 01:26:50,744
-Nothin'.
-Nothing.

1358
01:26:51,812 --> 01:26:54,014
He's gonna grow real fast.

1359
01:26:54,014 --> 01:26:55,916
He's going to be a real good
friend for you.

1360
01:26:57,451 --> 01:26:59,419
Everybody
forgot about me.

1361
01:27:00,754 --> 01:27:02,489
Ohh.

1362
01:27:02,489 --> 01:27:04,258
That's a terrible feeling.

1363
01:27:05,592 --> 01:27:08,262
We have to do something
about that.

1364
01:27:08,262 --> 01:27:09,563
Don't you
have to work?

1365
01:27:09,563 --> 01:27:10,998
Never again.

1366
01:27:12,699 --> 01:27:14,535
Walk... this way.

1367
01:27:17,838 --> 01:27:19,773
(laughing)

1368
01:27:21,541 --> 01:27:22,442
Bob: Faster!

1369
01:27:22,442 --> 01:27:23,510
(Avery laughing)

1370
01:27:24,611 --> 01:27:26,346
Faster.

1371
01:27:26,346 --> 01:27:27,814
There you go!

1372
01:27:29,916 --> 01:27:30,817
That's it.

1373
01:27:32,052 --> 01:27:34,054
Keep-- Keep a steady hold
on the line.

1374
01:27:38,892 --> 01:27:40,127
Yeah.
(chuckles)

1375
01:27:40,127 --> 01:27:41,728
Avery: It's flying!

1376
01:27:41,728 --> 01:27:43,931
Grandpa, look!
It's flying!

1377
01:27:43,931 --> 01:27:45,432
It's flying!

1378
01:27:45,432 --> 01:27:47,134
Good going, Avery!

1379
01:27:53,040 --> 01:27:55,342
(Avery laughing)

1380
01:27:57,044 --> 01:27:58,212
You bought him
a kite?

1381
01:27:58,212 --> 01:28:00,647
(laughing)
I bought it for me.

1382
01:28:00,647 --> 01:28:02,616
Wow, it looks like fun.

1383
01:28:02,616 --> 01:28:04,151
It is fun.

1384
01:28:04,151 --> 01:28:05,385
A lot of fun.

1385
01:28:06,420 --> 01:28:08,488
(Avery laughing)

1386
01:28:13,227 --> 01:28:14,327
