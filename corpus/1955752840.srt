1
00:01:22,927 --> 00:01:24,229
Eggy.

2
00:01:26,798 --> 00:01:29,133
You mind if I share your cab?

3
00:01:38,641 --> 00:01:39,841
Charlie?

4
00:01:43,213 --> 00:01:45,549
It's ironic, isn't it?

5
00:01:45,582 --> 00:01:48,152
You look like a gentleman,
I look like a pleb.

6
00:01:49,120 --> 00:01:51,323
If I was you,
I'd unlock your cab.

7
00:02:10,374 --> 00:02:13,078
Pete, get us out of here!

8
00:02:34,532 --> 00:02:36,334
You think that shit's
gonna work this time?

9
00:02:37,401 --> 00:02:39,204
You're way out of your depth.

10
00:03:25,182 --> 00:03:26,383
Fuck!

11
00:05:36,747 --> 00:05:38,516
Take him out!

12
00:05:48,860 --> 00:05:50,427
Merlin! We've got a Code Purple.

13
00:05:50,457 --> 00:05:51,498
My driver's down.

14
00:05:51,528 --> 00:05:53,731
Permission to blow
these fuckers away.

15
00:05:53,761 --> 00:05:54,869
<i>Denied.</i>

16
00:05:54,899 --> 00:05:56,867
Cannot be contained.

17
00:05:56,901 --> 00:05:58,536
Head south,
I'm clearing the route.

18
00:06:42,146 --> 00:06:43,415
Shit!

19
00:06:49,620 --> 00:06:51,055
Merlin,
I'm entering Hyde Park.

20
00:06:51,088 --> 00:06:52,957
Can I get on with it?

21
00:06:56,231 --> 00:06:57,431
Merlin!

22
00:06:57,461 --> 00:06:59,362
<i>Dark zone confirmed.
Permission to fire.</i>

23
00:06:59,396 --> 00:07:00,665
Thank fuck for that!

24
00:07:16,346 --> 00:07:19,182
<i>No time to relax.
Police are right behind you.</i>

25
00:07:19,216 --> 00:07:21,519
You have 30 seconds before
they reach your position.

26
00:07:21,552 --> 00:07:23,754
Go directly
to Rendezvous Swan.

27
00:07:34,365 --> 00:07:37,067
Merlin, you do realize I haven't
even got a windscreen right now?

28
00:07:37,100 --> 00:07:38,535
<i>I seem to remember
from your training</i>

29
00:07:38,569 --> 00:07:40,271
<i>you were rather good
at holding your breath.</i>

30
00:09:19,069 --> 00:09:20,305
<i>It wasn't
a revenge mission.</i>

31
00:09:20,338 --> 00:09:22,540
<i>Charlie could've just
killed you immediately.</i>

32
00:09:22,574 --> 00:09:24,375
Not boasting, but I
trained him well enough

33
00:09:24,409 --> 00:09:25,809
that even he wouldn't
mess that up.

34
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:26,981
<i>Merlin, I'm sorry,</i>

35
00:09:27,011 --> 00:09:28,411
<i>we're gonna have to do
the debrief tomorrow.</i>

36
00:09:28,445 --> 00:09:29,747
I've got to get
to a dinner tonight...

37
00:09:29,777 --> 00:09:30,818
and if I miss it,
let's just say

38
00:09:30,848 --> 00:09:32,149
Charlie might as well
have killed me.

39
00:09:32,179 --> 00:09:33,054
<i>Well, if you can't wait</i>

40
00:09:33,084 --> 00:09:34,221
<i>for the police
to clear the park...</i>

41
00:09:34,251 --> 00:09:35,752
<i>there's another way out
in the corner.</i>

42
00:09:46,530 --> 00:09:47,730
Fuck!

43
00:09:49,433 --> 00:09:51,269
How important is that dinner?

44
00:09:56,172 --> 00:09:57,372
Let me show you.

45
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:44,055
For fuck's sake!

46
00:10:47,358 --> 00:10:49,393
Babe.

47
00:10:50,627 --> 00:10:51,929
I'm home!

48
00:10:51,963 --> 00:10:53,163
I'm here.

49
00:10:59,469 --> 00:11:01,238
What the hell happened?

50
00:11:01,271 --> 00:11:04,742
It's a long story
that deserves a kiss.

51
00:11:04,776 --> 00:11:07,277
Not even JB
would kiss you right now.

52
00:11:09,179 --> 00:11:11,848
If you really love me,
just one little kiss.

53
00:11:15,786 --> 00:11:17,320
You were really gonna do it?

54
00:11:17,350 --> 00:11:18,458
Yeah.

55
00:11:18,488 --> 00:11:20,023
Now, that is
true love right there.

56
00:11:20,056 --> 00:11:22,259
Amazing. I'm gonna
go get changed.

57
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:34,237
And Tilde made that
for you herself, bruv.

58
00:11:35,638 --> 00:11:37,340
The royal baker's
not available.

59
00:11:38,608 --> 00:11:39,877
Shut up, Brandon.

60
00:11:39,910 --> 00:11:42,179
Especially if you
want some of this.

61
00:11:42,213 --> 00:11:44,381
Wait. Is that that
Swedish stuff right there?

62
00:11:44,411 --> 00:11:45,218
Yes.

63
00:11:45,248 --> 00:11:46,649
No, no. I ain't drinkin'
none of that.

64
00:11:46,683 --> 00:11:48,352
Last time here,
I was wrecked, man.

65
00:11:48,385 --> 00:11:50,354
Yeah, but that's 'cause you
were a lightweight, Jamal.

66
00:11:51,688 --> 00:11:54,625
No, no, babe, I'm good.
Not for me, thank you.

67
00:11:54,659 --> 00:11:56,761
What?
What's going on, man?

68
00:11:56,791 --> 00:11:57,832
I'm meeting her parents

69
00:11:57,862 --> 00:11:59,228
for the first time
tomorrow night.

70
00:12:00,229 --> 00:12:02,298
I wanna make a good
impression, so what?

71
00:12:02,332 --> 00:12:04,668
Yeah, Jamal,
are you free to dogsit JB

72
00:12:04,702 --> 00:12:06,037
tomorrow night
while we're there?

73
00:12:06,069 --> 00:12:08,439
Sorry, bruv, I've got
to look after my nan tomorrow.

74
00:12:08,472 --> 00:12:09,674
But Liam's free, though.

75
00:12:09,704 --> 00:12:10,810
Yeah?

76
00:12:10,840 --> 00:12:12,976
I can't, mate.
I'm allergic to dogs.

77
00:12:13,006 --> 00:12:13,914
Bullshit.

78
00:12:13,944 --> 00:12:15,245
Dogshit, actually.

79
00:12:16,446 --> 00:12:18,215
That leaves you, Brandon.
What you doing tomorrow night?

80
00:12:18,248 --> 00:12:19,816
Yeah, I'll look after
your dog, mate,

81
00:12:19,849 --> 00:12:21,418
but I got one condition.

82
00:12:21,448 --> 00:12:22,557
What's that?

83
00:12:22,587 --> 00:12:24,188
- You have a drink with us.
- Yeah.

84
00:12:24,222 --> 00:12:25,423
Got to do it, babe.

85
00:12:25,453 --> 00:12:26,592
Got to do it.

86
00:12:26,622 --> 00:12:28,158
Brandon, happy birthday!

87
00:12:28,726 --> 00:12:30,094
Happy birthday.

88
00:12:30,127 --> 00:12:31,429
- Yeah.
- Cheers.

89
00:12:32,161 --> 00:12:33,361
Shit.

90
00:12:35,998 --> 00:12:38,969
<i>My drugs are everywhere.</i>

91
00:12:40,871 --> 00:12:42,573
<i>They were never my thing...</i>

92
00:12:42,607 --> 00:12:43,841
<i>but here I am,</i>

93
00:12:43,873 --> 00:12:47,978
<i>running the biggest
drug cartel in the world.</i>

94
00:12:48,012 --> 00:12:52,483
<i>The only downside is having to
live in the middle of nowhere.</i>

95
00:12:54,885 --> 00:12:58,489
<i>You know, these ruins
are technically undiscovered.</i>

96
00:12:58,521 --> 00:13:01,792
<i>I just added a few touches
to remind me of home.</i>

97
00:13:02,992 --> 00:13:07,030
<i>I grew up on all that
awesome 50s nostalgia.</i>

98
00:13:07,064 --> 00:13:10,501
Grease. American Graffiti.
Happy Days.

99
00:13:11,768 --> 00:13:13,236
<i>But I digress.</i>

100
00:13:13,271 --> 00:13:15,139
<i>The thing
you need to understand</i>

101
00:13:15,171 --> 00:13:17,240
<i>is the hard work
and ingenuity...</i>

102
00:13:17,273 --> 00:13:20,610
<i>it took to achieve
a global monopoly...</i>

103
00:13:20,643 --> 00:13:22,060
on the drug trade.

104
00:13:22,090 --> 00:13:26,182
And that's all on me.
Not to toot my own horn...

105
00:13:26,215 --> 00:13:27,717
I just think
it's really important

106
00:13:27,752 --> 00:13:29,620
for new recruits
to understand...

107
00:13:29,652 --> 00:13:32,556
the history
of The Golden Circle.

108
00:13:37,026 --> 00:13:40,797
So. Lifelong friends?

109
00:13:40,830 --> 00:13:42,733
Charles, do you think
your buddy here

110
00:13:42,766 --> 00:13:44,267
is worthy of joining us?

111
00:13:44,300 --> 00:13:45,868
Ms. Poppy, I would
not have brought him

112
00:13:45,902 --> 00:13:47,503
all the way to see you
if I didn't think so.

113
00:13:47,537 --> 00:13:49,472
Excellent.
Well, you hungry?

114
00:13:49,502 --> 00:13:50,678
Starving.

115
00:13:50,708 --> 00:13:53,077
Wonderful! Right this way.

116
00:13:53,109 --> 00:13:54,911
Make yourselves at home.

117
00:13:56,280 --> 00:13:58,314
So, fellas...

118
00:13:58,348 --> 00:14:02,185
I have a couple of things
that I wanna clarify.

119
00:14:03,353 --> 00:14:05,455
You understand that
in The Golden Circle...

120
00:14:05,488 --> 00:14:08,959
my authority is never
to be questioned, right?

121
00:14:08,992 --> 00:14:10,761
And the importance
of following orders?

122
00:14:10,794 --> 00:14:12,929
Do you understand that?

123
00:14:12,963 --> 00:14:15,031
And the value of loyalty?

124
00:14:15,965 --> 00:14:18,034
It's easy to nod, isn't it?

125
00:14:20,737 --> 00:14:23,440
I don't like easy.
I like proof.

126
00:14:28,345 --> 00:14:31,247
- What's your name?
- Angel, ma'am.

127
00:14:31,281 --> 00:14:32,782
Angel, baby.

128
00:14:32,812 --> 00:14:33,919
Hey.

129
00:14:33,949 --> 00:14:36,219
Your old pal, Charles,
has messed up.

130
00:14:36,252 --> 00:14:37,655
That's all
I'm gonna tell you,

131
00:14:37,685 --> 00:14:38,824
'cause that's all
you need to know.

132
00:14:38,854 --> 00:14:40,358
So put him
in the mincer, okay?

133
00:15:42,752 --> 00:15:44,955
No, Miss Poppy!

134
00:16:04,275 --> 00:16:05,475
Good job!

135
00:16:06,944 --> 00:16:09,045
See my salon across the way?

136
00:16:12,382 --> 00:16:14,385
Head there for your makeover.

137
00:16:24,527 --> 00:16:27,430
Eggsy,
I hope you're hungry.

138
00:16:30,233 --> 00:16:33,170
Babe, I was gonna
grab breakfast at work.

139
00:16:33,203 --> 00:16:34,471
This looks lovely,
but I'm running late.

140
00:16:34,505 --> 00:16:37,841
I just thought maybe
we could practice?

141
00:16:37,871 --> 00:16:38,978
For tonight.

142
00:16:39,008 --> 00:16:40,710
Practice?

143
00:16:40,740 --> 00:16:41,749
Eating?

144
00:16:41,779 --> 00:16:44,949
You said you've never
eaten at a palace before.

145
00:16:44,982 --> 00:16:48,752
And Pappa is sort of picky
about table manners.

146
00:16:48,786 --> 00:16:51,821
Well, as it happens, babe,
I've got this shit on lock.

147
00:16:51,854 --> 00:16:53,189
I know what every single one

148
00:16:53,223 --> 00:16:55,158
of them knives
and forks is for.

149
00:16:57,627 --> 00:16:59,629
This is a butter knife.

150
00:16:59,662 --> 00:17:00,963
It's the only one
you need to remember,

151
00:17:00,997 --> 00:17:02,232
the rest of
the cutlery is easy.

152
00:17:02,262 --> 00:17:03,370
You start from the outside,

153
00:17:03,400 --> 00:17:05,603
and you work your way in
with each course.

154
00:17:05,636 --> 00:17:08,439
And never let anyone
describe you as "H.K.L.P."...

155
00:17:08,469 --> 00:17:09,608
What's that?

156
00:17:09,638 --> 00:17:11,241
"Holds knife like pen."

157
00:17:11,273 --> 00:17:12,508
A habit erroneously believed

158
00:17:12,541 --> 00:17:14,610
to be upper class
dining etiquette.

159
00:17:14,645 --> 00:17:16,513
It is quite the opposite.

160
00:17:18,816 --> 00:17:23,287
White wine, pudding wine,
red wine, water and pop.

161
00:17:23,319 --> 00:17:25,188
Or whatever tipple
takes your fancy.

162
00:17:27,023 --> 00:17:28,258
Am I supposed to wait
for everyone else

163
00:17:28,291 --> 00:17:29,626
to be served
before I start eating?

164
00:17:29,658 --> 00:17:31,361
Only if the dish
being served is cold.

165
00:17:31,395 --> 00:17:34,498
Or if the Queen is present.
Otherwise tuck in.

166
00:17:36,032 --> 00:17:37,400
Got to be honest...

167
00:17:37,434 --> 00:17:39,803
never really thought the
royalty bit would be relevant.

168
00:17:40,771 --> 00:17:42,106
Harry would've been chuffed.

169
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,776
I wish I could've met him.

170
00:17:51,315 --> 00:17:53,751
You miss him too,
don't you, Mr. Pickle?

171
00:18:06,029 --> 00:18:07,431
Mr. Pickle says, "Yeah."

172
00:18:09,066 --> 00:18:10,900
Hey, no, no,
sit down, I'm fine.

173
00:18:10,934 --> 00:18:12,837
I'm fine. Have a good day.

174
00:18:13,669 --> 00:18:14,869
Okay.

175
00:18:41,831 --> 00:18:45,034
Galahad! You're late.

176
00:18:45,068 --> 00:18:46,837
We were wondering
if you'd had

177
00:18:46,870 --> 00:18:48,705
a second encounter
with Charlie.

178
00:18:48,739 --> 00:18:51,575
I wish. I'm looking forward
to finishing him off.

179
00:18:56,111 --> 00:18:57,447
All right, gents.

180
00:18:58,948 --> 00:19:00,183
Merlin, come in.

181
00:19:00,754 --> 00:19:01,954
Galahad and Lancelot,

182
00:19:01,984 --> 00:19:04,120
please remain
for Merlin's debrief.

183
00:19:04,154 --> 00:19:07,724
Everyone else,
reconvene at 1900 hours.

184
00:19:08,992 --> 00:19:10,194
So...

185
00:19:11,660 --> 00:19:13,796
the man who attacked
Galahad in the taxi

186
00:19:13,830 --> 00:19:15,366
was Charlie Hesketh.

187
00:19:15,398 --> 00:19:17,466
Rejected Kingsman
applicant turned bad.

188
00:19:17,501 --> 00:19:20,002
We last saw him back
at Richmond Valentine's HQ.

189
00:19:20,035 --> 00:19:22,338
<i>I've caught
a fucking spy!</i>

190
00:19:26,443 --> 00:19:28,112
Like everyone else there...

191
00:19:28,145 --> 00:19:30,247
Charlie had a security
implant in his neck.

192
00:19:30,280 --> 00:19:33,216
A weakness we had no
choice but to exploit.

193
00:19:35,252 --> 00:19:39,322
Hey, Merlin. Still
fucking spectacular?

194
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:44,360
Come on, guys, loosen up.
We saved the world.

195
00:19:44,994 --> 00:19:46,262
Yeah.

196
00:19:46,296 --> 00:19:50,267
Unfortunately, Galahad,
you also saved Charlie.

197
00:19:50,300 --> 00:19:53,270
When you electrocuted him,
you damaged his implant.

198
00:19:53,303 --> 00:19:54,838
Instead of
his head exploding...

199
00:19:54,870 --> 00:19:57,340
he only lost an arm
and his vocal chords.

200
00:19:58,273 --> 00:19:59,542
Fucker should be thanking me.

201
00:19:59,576 --> 00:20:01,310
And now he's back
for revenge?

202
00:20:01,344 --> 00:20:03,046
We don't think so, sir.

203
00:20:03,076 --> 00:20:04,183
We believe
he's being recruited

204
00:20:04,213 --> 00:20:05,615
by an unknown organization.

205
00:20:05,648 --> 00:20:06,849
Lancelot?

206
00:20:06,883 --> 00:20:08,284
Got the police
autopsy reports

207
00:20:08,318 --> 00:20:11,154
from Charlie's colleagues
in the SUVs.

208
00:20:11,187 --> 00:20:12,656
They're not just
goons for hire.

209
00:20:13,356 --> 00:20:14,891
Fingerprints removed.

210
00:20:14,921 --> 00:20:16,029
Teeth filed smooth.

211
00:20:16,059 --> 00:20:18,596
I did a face recognition.
Nothing.

212
00:20:18,626 --> 00:20:19,598
And that thing?

213
00:20:19,628 --> 00:20:23,266
A cosmetic tattoo
made of 24-carat gold.

214
00:20:23,767 --> 00:20:25,135
They all had them.

215
00:20:25,167 --> 00:20:28,973
Seems like we're looking at some
kind of underworld organization.

216
00:20:32,876 --> 00:20:35,545
<i>Senora Poppy has sent me
for my makeover.</i>

217
00:20:35,579 --> 00:20:36,779
Follow me.

218
00:20:41,217 --> 00:20:42,619
<i>Please take your shirt off.</i>

219
00:21:24,394 --> 00:21:25,628
It's beautiful, isn't it?

220
00:21:26,797 --> 00:21:28,399
Not that.

221
00:21:29,265 --> 00:21:30,533
This.

222
00:21:33,604 --> 00:21:35,372
Bon appetit.

223
00:22:15,345 --> 00:22:17,014
How is it?

224
00:22:17,047 --> 00:22:19,049
It's delicious.

225
00:22:20,216 --> 00:22:23,387
Welcome to Golden Circle.

226
00:22:41,738 --> 00:22:43,774
I think we should
do you the favor

227
00:22:43,807 --> 00:22:46,076
of conversing
in English, yes.

228
00:22:48,945 --> 00:22:50,179
So, tell me...

229
00:22:50,213 --> 00:22:51,414
what do you do?

230
00:22:51,447 --> 00:22:54,016
I work for Kingsman,
the tailors, Your Highness.

231
00:22:54,050 --> 00:22:57,253
You may address my daughter
as "Your Highness."

232
00:22:57,287 --> 00:23:00,790
Please address the Queen and
myself with "Your Majesty."

233
00:23:00,823 --> 00:23:03,192
Pappa, this is
a family dinner...

234
00:23:03,225 --> 00:23:05,628
not some state function.

235
00:23:05,662 --> 00:23:08,498
Well then, Eggsy.

236
00:23:08,531 --> 00:23:10,867
What do you make
of the current situation

237
00:23:10,900 --> 00:23:12,969
in the Indian
financial markets?

238
00:23:13,403 --> 00:23:14,605
Pappa!

239
00:23:19,242 --> 00:23:20,476
Well...

240
00:23:22,979 --> 00:23:24,881
I don't think we can
underestimate the impact

241
00:23:24,915 --> 00:23:27,649
of ECB's quantitative
easing measures.

242
00:23:27,679 --> 00:23:28,788
And of course,
the liquidity wave

243
00:23:28,818 --> 00:23:30,485
from the US Federal
Reserve rate hike...

244
00:23:30,520 --> 00:23:31,989
getting pushed back.

245
00:23:41,396 --> 00:23:43,031
Frida Kahlo.

246
00:23:43,066 --> 00:23:47,170
Well, other than the 1939
acquisition by the Louvre...

247
00:23:47,203 --> 00:23:48,504
she wasn't really acknowledged

248
00:23:48,538 --> 00:23:50,240
until the new Mexicanisimo
art movement...

249
00:23:50,272 --> 00:23:51,942
of the late 1970s.

250
00:23:56,879 --> 00:23:58,514
Moorish revival.

251
00:23:58,548 --> 00:24:00,416
The Palazzo Sammezzano.

252
00:24:00,450 --> 00:24:01,752
In Tuscany.

253
00:24:02,418 --> 00:24:04,119
Beautiful.

254
00:24:05,422 --> 00:24:06,656
Bluetooth technology.

255
00:24:06,688 --> 00:24:08,323
Which, of course,
got its name

256
00:24:08,358 --> 00:24:10,126
from the legendary
Danish king...

257
00:24:10,159 --> 00:24:11,793
Harald Blatand, whose name

258
00:24:11,828 --> 00:24:14,963
translates to
"Bluetooth" in English.

259
00:24:14,998 --> 00:24:16,599
And the Bluetooth logo
is his initials

260
00:24:16,631 --> 00:24:18,200
in Norse runic symbols.

261
00:24:18,233 --> 00:24:20,302
And, as I'm sure you know...

262
00:24:20,336 --> 00:24:22,705
the Bluetooth logo
is his initials...

263
00:24:22,739 --> 00:24:24,508
in Norse runic symbols.

264
00:24:24,945 --> 00:24:26,145
<i>My God, Eggsy.</i>

265
00:24:26,175 --> 00:24:28,011
<i>Why isn't he eating
his fucking pudding?</i>

266
00:24:28,043 --> 00:24:29,878
I need to research
this gold tattoo.

267
00:24:29,913 --> 00:24:31,214
I found records
of other people

268
00:24:31,248 --> 00:24:32,716
with the same
body modifications.

269
00:24:34,450 --> 00:24:35,852
All of them have
high level involvement...

270
00:24:35,885 --> 00:24:37,987
with crime and international
drug trafficking.

271
00:24:38,021 --> 00:24:41,089
And there's rumors of something
called The Golden Circle.

272
00:24:48,665 --> 00:24:50,099
Best agent or best friend?

273
00:24:59,075 --> 00:25:01,878
Come on, JB.
Give it a rest, mate.

274
00:25:01,912 --> 00:25:05,115
Stop scratching the door.
I'm gonna get the blame now.

275
00:25:05,147 --> 00:25:06,347
There you are. Happy?

276
00:25:21,231 --> 00:25:22,965
With the decks and all that.

277
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:26,636
Shit, boy!

278
00:25:26,669 --> 00:25:28,037
What the...

279
00:25:35,444 --> 00:25:36,713
Do you reckon, JB...

280
00:25:37,681 --> 00:25:39,016
model material?

281
00:25:41,918 --> 00:25:44,987
<i>I must say, you're really
not as I expected.</i>

282
00:25:46,255 --> 00:25:48,358
Well, thank you very much...

283
00:25:48,392 --> 00:25:50,026
Your Majesty.

284
00:25:50,059 --> 00:25:51,795
<i>Eggsy?
Is that you, mate?</i>

285
00:25:51,828 --> 00:25:53,762
<i>What the fuck
is going on here?</i>

286
00:25:53,796 --> 00:25:55,165
<i>You a gangster now
or something?</i>

287
00:25:55,197 --> 00:25:57,766
Fuckin' hell. Is that Tilde's
mom and dad's house?

288
00:25:57,800 --> 00:25:59,435
Tell you what. Whatever
you're doing, I want in.

289
00:26:01,169 --> 00:26:02,872
Put it down!

290
00:26:03,406 --> 00:26:04,808
Why?

291
00:26:05,407 --> 00:26:07,444
I said, put it down now!

292
00:26:07,476 --> 00:26:08,678
What's wrong with it?

293
00:26:09,445 --> 00:26:11,180
Shut it! Fucking shut it!

294
00:26:11,213 --> 00:26:12,848
- Eggsy.
- I beg your pardon?

295
00:26:12,883 --> 00:26:14,651
<i>Shut it! Shut it now!</i>

296
00:26:14,684 --> 00:26:17,119
All right, mate.
Chill your boots.

297
00:26:18,221 --> 00:26:20,723
Eggsy, what...

298
00:26:20,756 --> 00:26:22,858
No. My God, no.
I'm so sorry.

299
00:26:23,960 --> 00:26:25,329
You shut up and all.
You got me in enough trouble.

300
00:26:53,021 --> 00:26:55,358
The next order of business...

301
00:26:55,392 --> 00:26:57,260
Agent Percival.

302
00:27:04,000 --> 00:27:05,200
<i>Arthur.</i>

303
00:27:08,672 --> 00:27:09,873
Fuck.

304
00:27:15,677 --> 00:27:17,313
Yep.

305
00:27:17,347 --> 00:27:20,751
Kingsman is crumpets.

306
00:27:22,417 --> 00:27:26,322
Like toast, but British.

307
00:27:26,356 --> 00:27:28,023
And to say thank you...

308
00:27:28,057 --> 00:27:30,627
I got you a present, Charlie.

309
00:27:30,659 --> 00:27:35,698
My guys made you this.

310
00:27:37,800 --> 00:27:42,405
Bigger, badder, better.
I call it...

311
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:44,974
ARMageddon.

312
00:28:04,194 --> 00:28:06,128
Let's see
if your game improves.

313
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:20,276
Ouch.

314
00:28:58,181 --> 00:28:59,982
Someone decides
to wipe out

315
00:29:00,015 --> 00:29:01,817
every Kingsman property...

316
00:29:01,850 --> 00:29:04,220
every agent, and somehow...

317
00:29:04,253 --> 00:29:07,022
conveniently,
you weren't at home.

318
00:29:07,056 --> 00:29:08,825
I could say the same thing
about you.

319
00:29:08,858 --> 00:29:11,226
What, you think
I'd kill Roxy?

320
00:29:11,260 --> 00:29:14,097
And my mate, Brandon,
and my fucking dog?

321
00:29:14,129 --> 00:29:15,329
No.

322
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:18,801
You think I would?

323
00:29:23,338 --> 00:29:25,809
This thing...

324
00:29:26,742 --> 00:29:29,110
hacked us.

325
00:29:29,145 --> 00:29:31,514
Clearly, this arm can be
remotely controlled.

326
00:29:32,781 --> 00:29:34,116
I'm only alive
because my address

327
00:29:34,149 --> 00:29:36,352
wasn't on the database
with the agents.

328
00:29:37,220 --> 00:29:38,521
Whoever Charlie's
working with

329
00:29:38,554 --> 00:29:43,292
doesn't think that mere
staff are missile-worthy.

330
00:29:44,292 --> 00:29:45,727
This ain't funny.

331
00:29:45,762 --> 00:29:47,864
Roxy is dead!

332
00:29:47,896 --> 00:29:50,032
Everyone's dead! Gone!
Do you even care?

333
00:29:50,066 --> 00:29:51,601
Pull yourself together.

334
00:29:51,634 --> 00:29:54,069
Remember your training.

335
00:29:54,102 --> 00:29:56,005
There's no time for emotion
in this scenario.

336
00:29:59,347 --> 00:30:00,547
Now...

337
00:30:00,577 --> 00:30:02,744
as all surviving agents
are present,

338
00:30:02,779 --> 00:30:05,147
we follow
the doomsday protocol.

339
00:30:05,181 --> 00:30:08,385
When that's done,
and only then...

340
00:30:10,653 --> 00:30:12,789
you may shed a tear
in private.

341
00:30:15,590 --> 00:30:17,560
Okay.

342
00:30:17,592 --> 00:30:19,128
What's the doomsday protocol?

343
00:30:20,597 --> 00:30:22,199
We go shopping.

344
00:30:36,413 --> 00:30:39,915
We're from Kingsman.
We'd like to buy some wine.

345
00:30:39,948 --> 00:30:42,952
And use tasting room
number three, please.

346
00:30:46,588 --> 00:30:48,058
Not one of
my predecessors

347
00:30:48,090 --> 00:30:50,292
has ever been
in this situation before.

348
00:30:52,494 --> 00:30:53,896
Thank God.

349
00:30:57,099 --> 00:30:58,299
A...

350
00:31:01,637 --> 00:31:02,871
Remember this?

351
00:31:02,906 --> 00:31:04,174
Yeah,
how could I forget?

352
00:31:13,448 --> 00:31:16,518
Whatever's in that safe is the
answer to all our problems.

353
00:31:32,768 --> 00:31:33,970
Is that it?

354
00:31:34,002 --> 00:31:36,205
I suppose that must be
upper-class humor.

355
00:31:37,906 --> 00:31:39,175
I don't get it.

356
00:31:39,207 --> 00:31:41,143
Me neither. What the fuck
are we supposed to do now?

357
00:31:42,912 --> 00:31:44,114
I think we should
drink a toast

358
00:31:44,146 --> 00:31:45,982
to our fallen comrades.

359
00:31:50,523 --> 00:31:51,723
To Roxy.

360
00:31:51,753 --> 00:31:52,988
Roxy.

361
00:32:01,164 --> 00:32:03,233
- To Arthur.
- Arthur.

362
00:32:08,169 --> 00:32:09,504
Should we do one for JB?

363
00:32:09,538 --> 00:32:10,738
I think we should.

364
00:32:24,319 --> 00:32:26,388
I should have seen it coming.

365
00:32:27,056 --> 00:32:28,790
Charlie, the taxi.

366
00:32:28,823 --> 00:32:30,158
It's all my fault.

367
00:32:30,192 --> 00:32:33,997
No, that's bullshit, Merlin.
It ain't all your fault.

368
00:32:34,830 --> 00:32:36,498
You're the best, bruv.

369
00:32:36,531 --> 00:32:38,434
Honestly, without you...

370
00:32:38,467 --> 00:32:40,669
I'd have lost it
a long time ago.

371
00:32:43,405 --> 00:32:45,107
I think we should
drink to Scotland.

372
00:32:45,140 --> 00:32:48,043
I think we've probably
had enough, to be honest.

373
00:32:48,977 --> 00:32:50,346
You're probably right.

374
00:32:57,887 --> 00:33:00,222
- Merlin.
- Aye?

375
00:33:00,255 --> 00:33:02,524
I think we're going
to Kentucky.

376
00:33:02,559 --> 00:33:04,527
Fried Chicken?

377
00:33:04,557 --> 00:33:05,732
I love fried chicken.

378
00:33:05,762 --> 00:33:08,298
No, proper Kentucky. Look.

379
00:33:09,165 --> 00:33:11,133
You know what else I love?

380
00:33:11,166 --> 00:33:12,735
Country and western music.

381
00:33:42,065 --> 00:33:45,101
Here's where we leave
the casks to age.

382
00:33:45,134 --> 00:33:46,335
Unfortunately, we can't go in,

383
00:33:46,368 --> 00:33:49,004
as it's a temperature-controlled
environment.

384
00:33:49,039 --> 00:33:51,674
So let's move on to
our world class stud farm...

385
00:33:51,706 --> 00:33:54,609
and meet three of
our Kentucky Derby winners.

386
00:33:57,579 --> 00:33:59,749
Biometric security scanner
just to protect

387
00:33:59,781 --> 00:34:02,016
a few old barrels of whiskey?

388
00:34:02,050 --> 00:34:03,653
Pull the other one, love.

389
00:34:04,520 --> 00:34:05,720
Got it.

390
00:34:13,062 --> 00:34:14,497
Are you getting anything?

391
00:34:15,363 --> 00:34:16,563
Not yet.

392
00:34:18,204 --> 00:34:19,404
Fucking hell.

393
00:34:19,434 --> 00:34:21,236
It's a shame
it's not scotch.

394
00:34:23,405 --> 00:34:25,073
Hang on.

395
00:34:25,108 --> 00:34:26,475
According to this,
there's a huge

396
00:34:26,508 --> 00:34:28,543
underground structure
right beneath us.

397
00:34:28,577 --> 00:34:30,513
And if my calculations
are correct...

398
00:34:34,383 --> 00:34:35,583
This...

399
00:34:36,051 --> 00:34:37,553
is the way in.

400
00:34:40,089 --> 00:34:41,890
Fucking hell, Merlin. Shit.

401
00:34:41,923 --> 00:34:43,459
You know, my mama...

402
00:34:44,225 --> 00:34:46,461
she always told me...

403
00:34:46,495 --> 00:34:50,032
us southerners get our good
manners from the British.

404
00:34:50,066 --> 00:34:53,169
I was thinkin',
ain't that a pity.

405
00:34:53,202 --> 00:34:55,271
Y'all didn't keep nothing
for yourselves.

406
00:35:02,278 --> 00:35:05,781
Y'all ain't never heard of
knocking before you enter?

407
00:35:05,814 --> 00:35:08,050
Well, actually we had
an invitation. Didn't we?

408
00:35:08,080 --> 00:35:09,221
- Yeah.
- Did you now?

409
00:35:09,251 --> 00:35:12,187
Yeah. It came in the
shape of a bottle.

410
00:35:12,220 --> 00:35:14,088
We're from the Kingsman
tailor shop in London.

411
00:35:14,122 --> 00:35:15,657
Maybe you've heard of us?

412
00:35:15,687 --> 00:35:16,795
The Kingsman.

413
00:35:16,825 --> 00:35:19,093
Yeah.

414
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:20,495
That's where y'all got
them fine suits

415
00:35:20,530 --> 00:35:22,131
and them fancy
spectacles y'all got on?

416
00:35:22,164 --> 00:35:23,700
- Exactly.
- That's right.

417
00:35:23,733 --> 00:35:26,068
Y'all look damn sharp.

418
00:35:26,100 --> 00:35:27,436
Let me see
if I got it right, here.

419
00:35:27,470 --> 00:35:30,740
You want me to believe that
it's normal for a tailor...

420
00:35:30,772 --> 00:35:34,077
to hack through an advanced
biometric security system...

421
00:35:34,109 --> 00:35:36,646
with nothing but a little
bitty old watch on?

422
00:35:42,017 --> 00:35:43,818
I can promise you...

423
00:35:43,848 --> 00:35:44,958
that dog don't hunt.

424
00:35:44,988 --> 00:35:46,622
So why don't you go on and
get down on your knees...

425
00:35:46,655 --> 00:35:48,724
and tell me
who you really work for.

426
00:35:59,401 --> 00:36:02,104
That's 1963 Statesman Reserve.

427
00:36:02,138 --> 00:36:03,506
You just made it personal.

428
00:36:24,225 --> 00:36:26,495
Who the fuck are you?

429
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:39,242
A bottle
in a secret wall.

430
00:36:40,776 --> 00:36:42,979
You really expect me
to take that seriously?

431
00:36:44,446 --> 00:36:46,348
See, I think
your story's horse shit.

432
00:36:46,381 --> 00:36:49,818
Y'all just trying to cover
for a failed rescue mission.

433
00:36:49,852 --> 00:36:52,388
You here for the
lepidopterist, ain't you?

434
00:36:56,492 --> 00:36:58,928
Okay, so your
mystery bottle?

435
00:37:01,631 --> 00:37:03,031
Look anything like that,
right there?

436
00:37:03,064 --> 00:37:05,334
Yes. Same brand,
much older.

437
00:37:05,868 --> 00:37:07,068
All right.

438
00:37:08,370 --> 00:37:09,671
Let's see here.

439
00:37:11,006 --> 00:37:12,241
You know why the measurement

440
00:37:12,274 --> 00:37:15,310
of alcohol content's
called "proof"?

441
00:37:15,345 --> 00:37:16,712
Fuck off!

442
00:37:16,745 --> 00:37:19,580
For Pete's sake.

443
00:37:19,615 --> 00:37:21,450
See, comes from back
in the old days...

444
00:37:21,484 --> 00:37:24,020
when pirates wanted to test
the strength of their rum.

445
00:37:24,053 --> 00:37:26,455
They used to pour a little
bit out on gunpowder.

446
00:37:30,059 --> 00:37:32,327
That'll make you wanna slap
your mama right there, boy.

447
00:37:33,533 --> 00:37:34,733
And if the gunpowder,

448
00:37:34,763 --> 00:37:36,399
if it burnt when
they set it alight...

449
00:37:36,432 --> 00:37:38,134
they considered it proof...

450
00:37:38,167 --> 00:37:40,370
that their rum
was good and strong.

451
00:37:42,303 --> 00:37:44,840
But see, I ain't got
no gunpowder on me, do I?

452
00:37:46,776 --> 00:37:48,077
But I'm pretty sure
you boys'll make

453
00:37:48,111 --> 00:37:49,944
just as impressive
of a sound...

454
00:37:49,977 --> 00:37:51,481
when I set your balls on fire.

455
00:37:55,751 --> 00:37:58,120
Or you could just tell me who
the fuck y'all really are...

456
00:37:58,150 --> 00:37:59,291
and how the hell
y'all found us.

457
00:37:59,321 --> 00:38:00,756
Look,
for the last time,

458
00:38:00,789 --> 00:38:03,258
we have nothing to protect
but our honor.

459
00:38:03,292 --> 00:38:05,127
So you can take
your cheap horse piss

460
00:38:05,157 --> 00:38:06,331
that you call whiskey...

461
00:38:06,361 --> 00:38:07,896
which, by the way,
is spelled without an "e"...

462
00:38:07,930 --> 00:38:10,366
and is nothing compared
to a single malt scotch...

463
00:38:10,399 --> 00:38:12,669
and you can go
fuck yourself.

464
00:38:15,437 --> 00:38:16,838
What about you?

465
00:38:16,868 --> 00:38:18,010
- Me?
- Yeah.

466
00:38:18,040 --> 00:38:20,542
No, I love
a Jack and Coke, bruv.

467
00:38:20,575 --> 00:38:23,646
But I do agree with the part
where you go fuck yourself.

468
00:38:27,254 --> 00:38:28,454
All right.

469
00:38:28,484 --> 00:38:29,554
Y'all ain't got
nothing to protect

470
00:38:29,584 --> 00:38:30,819
other than your honor.

471
00:38:31,954 --> 00:38:34,057
Let's see what happens
when we change things up.

472
00:38:42,164 --> 00:38:43,799
- Fuck me.
- Harry?

473
00:38:43,832 --> 00:38:45,868
Y'all got three seconds
to tell me the truth.

474
00:38:45,898 --> 00:38:47,005
Wait. No.

475
00:38:47,035 --> 00:38:48,206
- No!
- Harry!

476
00:38:48,236 --> 00:38:50,138
He can't hear you.
But I can, so talk.

477
00:38:50,171 --> 00:38:52,273
- No!
- Get down, Harry!

478
00:38:52,307 --> 00:38:54,142
- Harry! Harry!
- That's two.

479
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,444
- Harry!
- Harry!

480
00:38:55,477 --> 00:38:57,046
- Harry!
- Three.

481
00:38:57,079 --> 00:38:58,781
Stop!

482
00:38:59,448 --> 00:39:01,350
Their story checked out.

483
00:39:01,383 --> 00:39:03,418
I opened our doomsday
scenario locker

484
00:39:03,452 --> 00:39:05,354
and that umbrella was in it.

485
00:39:05,387 --> 00:39:08,591
Kingsman.
It's got our logo on it.

486
00:39:09,896 --> 00:39:11,096
I'm really sorry.

487
00:39:11,126 --> 00:39:13,762
My apologies, boys.

488
00:39:13,794 --> 00:39:15,897
I hope there ain't
no hard feelings.

489
00:39:15,930 --> 00:39:17,130
I was just doin' my job.

490
00:39:18,066 --> 00:39:19,300
Welcome to the Statesman,

491
00:39:19,334 --> 00:39:21,502
independent
intelligence agency.

492
00:39:21,537 --> 00:39:22,838
Just like y'all, I reckon.

493
00:39:22,870 --> 00:39:25,039
But our founders went
into the booze business.

494
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,273
Thank the sweet Lord above.

495
00:39:26,845 --> 00:39:28,045
This is Ginger Ale.

496
00:39:28,075 --> 00:39:29,810
She's our strategy executive.

497
00:39:29,845 --> 00:39:31,045
Hello.

498
00:39:31,546 --> 00:39:33,715
I'm Agent Tequila.

499
00:39:33,749 --> 00:39:35,685
This is the part
where you untie us.

500
00:39:39,254 --> 00:39:40,556
Thank you.

501
00:39:46,734 --> 00:39:47,934
Harry.

502
00:39:47,964 --> 00:39:49,432
- Hello.
- Hello, mate.

503
00:39:54,269 --> 00:39:55,872
<i>Harry.</i>

504
00:39:55,905 --> 00:39:57,105
<i>How do you do?</i>

505
00:39:58,106 --> 00:39:59,908
Have we met before?

506
00:39:59,941 --> 00:40:04,345
Harry, it's okay. It's fine.
They know that we know you.

507
00:40:04,379 --> 00:40:06,781
I think there must be
some mistake.

508
00:40:06,814 --> 00:40:09,517
It's been such
a long time, Harry.

509
00:40:09,551 --> 00:40:12,688
I need to get
my brogues resoled.

510
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:15,557
Yeah, and my oxfords
are done in as well.

511
00:40:15,591 --> 00:40:17,894
Why are you telling me
about your shoes?

512
00:40:23,030 --> 00:40:24,230
I'm a lepidopterist.

513
00:40:25,066 --> 00:40:26,367
You're a what?

514
00:40:26,401 --> 00:40:27,936
I study butterflies.

515
00:40:31,941 --> 00:40:35,477
Well, you wanted to be before
you joined the army, but...

516
00:40:37,412 --> 00:40:38,881
Harry, look at me.

517
00:40:45,454 --> 00:40:46,823
<i>It's good to see you.</i>

518
00:40:47,827 --> 00:40:49,027
<i>We'll be back soon.</i>

519
00:40:49,057 --> 00:40:52,093
So these fellas right here
are our doomsday protocol?

520
00:40:52,127 --> 00:40:55,497
Turns out, our founder's
tailor was Kingsman.

521
00:40:57,966 --> 00:40:59,301
What the fuck
have you done to him?

522
00:40:59,334 --> 00:41:01,603
Nothing. Only tried
to help him.

523
00:41:01,637 --> 00:41:02,937
He's got
retrograde amnesia.

524
00:41:02,972 --> 00:41:04,205
Now, we knew
from his eyeglasses

525
00:41:04,235 --> 00:41:05,277
that he was intelligence.

526
00:41:05,307 --> 00:41:06,542
We just didn't know whose.

527
00:41:07,642 --> 00:41:09,244
How did he get here?

528
00:41:11,580 --> 00:41:13,649
What the hell?

529
00:41:13,682 --> 00:41:15,984
Tequila, I'm getting
a crazy spike...

530
00:41:16,017 --> 00:41:18,653
of extreme low frequency waves
11 miles from here.

531
00:41:18,687 --> 00:41:20,623
I'm gonna need you to
escort me there immediately.

532
00:41:48,649 --> 00:41:50,151
I need your alpha gel.

533
00:41:51,854 --> 00:41:53,689
I'll go check the church.

534
00:42:08,202 --> 00:42:10,372
<i>We developed
our alpha gel technology</i>

535
00:42:10,405 --> 00:42:11,606
<i>for our own agents...</i>

536
00:42:11,640 --> 00:42:13,408
<i>in the event of a head shot.</i>

537
00:42:13,441 --> 00:42:14,877
<i>The gel protects the brain.</i>

538
00:42:14,910 --> 00:42:17,513
<i>Then, in the lab,
we use nanites...</i>

539
00:42:17,546 --> 00:42:20,249
<i>micro-bots,
to repair tissue damage.</i>

540
00:42:26,789 --> 00:42:28,390
<i>There are side effects.</i>

541
00:42:28,423 --> 00:42:29,624
<i>Partial amnesia...</i>

542
00:42:29,658 --> 00:42:31,660
<i>regression to
the younger self.</i>

543
00:42:31,693 --> 00:42:35,664
<i>With no idea who he was,
there was nothing we could do.</i>

544
00:42:36,598 --> 00:42:39,066
But now
you guys are here...

545
00:42:39,100 --> 00:42:41,102
there's a good chance
we can bring him back.

546
00:43:09,303 --> 00:43:10,503
You're late.

547
00:43:10,533 --> 00:43:12,167
Why are you
still wearing that?

548
00:43:12,200 --> 00:43:15,803
Until you get rid of
the perimeter landmines...

549
00:43:15,838 --> 00:43:18,240
I'll keep wearing the suit,
thank you very much.

550
00:43:18,270 --> 00:43:19,378
Scaredy-cat.

551
00:43:19,408 --> 00:43:20,709
Shut up and sit down.

552
00:43:20,742 --> 00:43:22,077
Let's go!

553
00:43:24,946 --> 00:43:27,316
<i>Crocodile Rock, please.</i>

554
00:43:29,184 --> 00:43:31,053
<i>Fuck you!</i>

555
00:43:32,988 --> 00:43:36,692
<i>Hey, hey, Elton, language.</i>

556
00:43:36,725 --> 00:43:39,962
<i>Okay, as fabulous
as your catalogue is...</i>

557
00:43:39,995 --> 00:43:42,531
<i>I think I want to hear
some Gershwin.</i>

558
00:43:44,771 --> 00:43:45,971
I still can't believe...

559
00:43:46,001 --> 00:43:48,504
you got away with
kidnapping Elton John.

560
00:43:48,537 --> 00:43:51,372
I know! But with Valentine
abducting those celebrities...

561
00:43:51,405 --> 00:43:54,309
it seemed silly not to take
advantage of the confusion.

562
00:43:55,910 --> 00:43:58,313
Shit. Has Elton
got the blue rash?

563
00:44:01,550 --> 00:44:02,750
<i>Lights.</i>

564
00:44:04,553 --> 00:44:06,488
<i>Hey, Elton.</i>

565
00:44:06,521 --> 00:44:08,522
<i>Have you been a bad boy again?</i>

566
00:44:09,624 --> 00:44:12,093
<i>You're lying.
Look at your hands.</i>

567
00:44:15,696 --> 00:44:16,964
What is it?

568
00:44:16,997 --> 00:44:19,934
<i>It's proof that my plan
is gonna work.</i>

569
00:44:19,968 --> 00:44:24,205
<i>It's also the first sign
of a slow and horrible death.</i>

570
00:44:25,874 --> 00:44:28,144
<i>Don't worry, I can fix it.</i>

571
00:44:28,176 --> 00:44:29,812
<i>Tell me who
you partied with.</i>

572
00:44:33,582 --> 00:44:35,151
It was Angel.

573
00:44:35,783 --> 00:44:39,753
<i>Not very angelic.</i>

574
00:44:39,787 --> 00:44:41,423
<i>Gonna have to clip his wings.</i>

575
00:45:18,026 --> 00:45:19,961
Close the door behind you.

576
00:45:28,336 --> 00:45:30,838
At what point are you
going to start behaving

577
00:45:30,872 --> 00:45:32,740
like a Statesman, Tequila?

578
00:45:32,774 --> 00:45:35,310
You wanna go back
to being a rodeo clown?

579
00:45:35,343 --> 00:45:37,278
No, sir. I apologize, sir.

580
00:45:39,515 --> 00:45:41,350
I'm Champagne.

581
00:45:41,383 --> 00:45:43,852
But anyone who knows
what's good for him...

582
00:45:45,354 --> 00:45:46,888
calls me Champ.

583
00:45:47,689 --> 00:45:49,290
Sorry for your troubles.

584
00:45:50,057 --> 00:45:51,892
As your American cousins...

585
00:45:51,926 --> 00:45:57,133
I'm placing all of Statesman's considerably
larger resources at your disposal.

586
00:45:59,734 --> 00:46:02,403
Can you imagine us
in the clothing business?

587
00:46:05,874 --> 00:46:08,076
Now, how can I help you?

588
00:46:08,109 --> 00:46:10,012
First of all,
I've got to thank you

589
00:46:10,044 --> 00:46:11,613
for saving Agent Galahad.

590
00:46:11,643 --> 00:46:12,817
Wait.

591
00:46:12,847 --> 00:46:14,715
You said that
you were Galahad.

592
00:46:14,749 --> 00:46:17,051
No, he's talking
about the butterfly guy.

593
00:46:17,086 --> 00:46:18,754
That used to be
his handle.

594
00:46:18,784 --> 00:46:19,925
Galahad always said,

595
00:46:19,955 --> 00:46:21,156
"You've got to look at
the bigger picture...

596
00:46:21,189 --> 00:46:23,223
"ask 'why' as well as 'who'."

597
00:46:23,258 --> 00:46:25,260
So if someone wanted
to take out Kingsman...

598
00:46:25,294 --> 00:46:27,462
then they've got to be
planning something major.

599
00:46:27,495 --> 00:46:28,762
So what do you know?

600
00:46:28,796 --> 00:46:30,164
They're a drug cartel,
we think.

601
00:46:30,198 --> 00:46:32,568
The name Golden Circle
keeps coming up.

602
00:46:32,600 --> 00:46:35,035
We'll look
into them. What else?

603
00:46:35,069 --> 00:46:37,638
One of our former trainees
is working with them.

604
00:46:37,673 --> 00:46:40,274
Charlie Hesketh.
Total prick.

605
00:46:40,307 --> 00:46:42,577
You got any promising
leads on him?

606
00:46:42,607 --> 00:46:43,748
His ex-girlfriend.

607
00:46:43,778 --> 00:46:46,747
I've been tracking her
through social media.

608
00:46:46,780 --> 00:46:50,151
We believe she's still
in contact with him.

609
00:46:50,184 --> 00:46:53,922
And she's going to
Glastonbury Music Festival.

610
00:46:55,156 --> 00:46:57,024
Good.

611
00:46:57,059 --> 00:46:59,394
Agent Tequila,
break out your dancing shoes.

612
00:46:59,428 --> 00:47:00,662
You have a new mission.

613
00:47:00,696 --> 00:47:01,997
Yes, sir.

614
00:47:02,765 --> 00:47:03,966
Hold up.

615
00:47:06,138 --> 00:47:07,338
You feeling okay?

616
00:47:07,368 --> 00:47:10,372
I'm a little tired,
but fine, thanks.

617
00:47:10,402 --> 00:47:11,543
Galahad, you ready?

618
00:47:11,573 --> 00:47:12,677
Your face...

619
00:47:12,707 --> 00:47:14,076
You got...

620
00:47:16,812 --> 00:47:18,847
What the fuck?

621
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:20,515
Shit.

622
00:47:21,716 --> 00:47:22,916
Head to the sick bay.

623
00:47:22,950 --> 00:47:25,454
Have Ginger check you out.

624
00:47:25,486 --> 00:47:28,389
Hey, give him
your glasses.

625
00:47:32,660 --> 00:47:35,030
You're in luck, kid.
Put 'em on.

626
00:47:36,097 --> 00:47:37,931
You get
our finest senior agent

627
00:47:37,966 --> 00:47:39,901
to join you instead.

628
00:47:39,934 --> 00:47:42,503
Right now,
he's in our New York office.

629
00:47:42,537 --> 00:47:45,140
Galahad, meet Agent Whiskey.

630
00:47:47,642 --> 00:47:49,077
<i>Kid...</i>

631
00:47:49,111 --> 00:47:52,681
looks like we're hookin' up
with a chick at a rock concert.

632
00:47:52,714 --> 00:47:54,783
My favorite kind of mission.

633
00:47:54,816 --> 00:47:57,252
<i>I'm sending my jet
to pick you up.</i>

634
00:48:08,263 --> 00:48:11,267
We've dealt with
this kind of amnesia before.

635
00:48:11,300 --> 00:48:14,937
Harry's like a computer
that needs to be rebooted.

636
00:48:16,238 --> 00:48:20,042
We need to recreate a shock
or trauma from his past...

637
00:48:20,075 --> 00:48:21,443
to trigger his memory.

638
00:48:22,977 --> 00:48:24,312
I hope you're right.

639
00:48:33,921 --> 00:48:35,290
<i>Excuse me.</i>

640
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:38,026
<i>There seems to be
some sort of a problem here.</i>

641
00:48:38,059 --> 00:48:40,696
<i>Help! Somebody!</i>

642
00:48:40,729 --> 00:48:44,033
What the hell is
going on? Help me!

643
00:48:46,868 --> 00:48:48,103
Help!

644
00:48:49,742 --> 00:48:50,942
God!

645
00:48:50,972 --> 00:48:53,242
Stop! Fuck!

646
00:49:14,367 --> 00:49:15,567
Get him out now.

647
00:49:15,597 --> 00:49:17,533
No, no, wait. His instincts
are gonna kick in.

648
00:49:29,745 --> 00:49:31,347
No. I'm sorry to do this.

649
00:49:52,300 --> 00:49:54,535
- Are you okay?
- What happened?

650
00:49:54,568 --> 00:49:57,137
Harry, you've forgotten
who you are.

651
00:49:57,171 --> 00:50:00,574
We thought this might
jog your memory.

652
00:50:00,609 --> 00:50:03,678
Look, when you were young,
you had a choice.

653
00:50:03,711 --> 00:50:06,447
To either be a lepidopterist
or to join the army.

654
00:50:06,481 --> 00:50:09,283
You chose the army.
That led to Kingsman.

655
00:50:09,316 --> 00:50:12,286
You became a Kingsman agent.

656
00:50:12,321 --> 00:50:13,755
I doubt whether
I'd work for anyone

657
00:50:13,789 --> 00:50:14,989
who drowns their employees.

658
00:50:15,856 --> 00:50:17,158
I want to go home.

659
00:50:17,191 --> 00:50:18,793
I want
my butterfly collection.

660
00:50:20,095 --> 00:50:21,629
I want to see Mother.

661
00:50:23,164 --> 00:50:25,300
<i>There's nothing more
we can do.</i>

662
00:50:26,700 --> 00:50:28,269
It's time to let him go.

663
00:50:37,979 --> 00:50:39,448
<i>Babe, I wish
I could stay longer,</i>

664
00:50:39,481 --> 00:50:41,116
<i>but I've got to go on
with this mission.</i>

665
00:50:41,149 --> 00:50:44,252
Wait, wait, wait.

666
00:50:44,285 --> 00:50:46,789
Before you go,
I wanna show you something.

667
00:50:50,158 --> 00:50:52,694
I know he could
never replace JB...

668
00:50:52,727 --> 00:50:54,129
but...

669
00:50:56,097 --> 00:50:58,265
My days.

670
00:50:58,300 --> 00:51:00,535
I hoped he might
make you happy.

671
00:51:03,504 --> 00:51:06,140
And give you another reason
to come back home soon.

672
00:51:06,874 --> 00:51:08,208
I love him.

673
00:51:08,243 --> 00:51:10,345
But I don't need another
reason to come home.

674
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:21,156
I apologize.
Just waiting for my friend.

675
00:51:21,189 --> 00:51:23,091
I'll be back as soon
as I can, I promise.

676
00:51:24,825 --> 00:51:26,927
- Got to go save the world?
- Yep.

677
00:51:26,961 --> 00:51:28,763
Well, if you save the world...

678
00:51:29,964 --> 00:51:31,733
you know what that means.

679
00:51:31,767 --> 00:51:33,402
Yeah, all right.

680
00:51:36,671 --> 00:51:37,871
Bye, buddy.

681
00:51:44,077 --> 00:51:45,613
Got the passes
from my contact.

682
00:51:46,481 --> 00:51:48,450
You're gonna love Glastonbury.

683
00:51:49,383 --> 00:51:51,385
Well, that's
the easy part, kid.

684
00:51:51,419 --> 00:51:53,522
Take a look
in the glove box.

685
00:51:57,892 --> 00:51:59,260
Fucking hell, bruv.

686
00:51:59,294 --> 00:52:01,729
Thought everything was supposed
to be bigger in America.

687
00:52:01,763 --> 00:52:04,165
Is this why you overcompensate
with these massive cars?

688
00:52:04,198 --> 00:52:05,966
Goes on your finger.

689
00:52:06,001 --> 00:52:07,368
The surveillance tracker
is in the tip.

690
00:52:07,401 --> 00:52:10,771
Apply light pressure for three
seconds to release it.

691
00:52:16,644 --> 00:52:19,213
Okay, so according
to her Instagram feed...

692
00:52:19,247 --> 00:52:22,216
Charlie's ex-girlfriend
is up ahead at the VIP bar.

693
00:52:22,249 --> 00:52:24,084
Which one of us is gonna
plant the tracker?

694
00:52:24,118 --> 00:52:25,454
Bands, boys.

695
00:52:26,187 --> 00:52:28,223
Yeah, that's fine.

696
00:52:28,256 --> 00:52:30,959
I say we both
make an approach...

697
00:52:30,992 --> 00:52:32,894
whoever gets on best,
goes for it.

698
00:52:32,928 --> 00:52:34,529
Well, it doesn't have
to be a competition, bruv.

699
00:52:34,562 --> 00:52:35,931
Why don't we just
go up to her...

700
00:52:35,964 --> 00:52:37,232
shake her hand,
pat her on the back,

701
00:52:37,265 --> 00:52:39,401
whatever, you know.
Job done.

702
00:52:39,434 --> 00:52:42,604
The hand is not
a mucous membrane, Eggsy.

703
00:52:42,638 --> 00:52:44,572
Neither is the back.

704
00:52:44,604 --> 00:52:46,406
They teach you anything
at Kingsman?

705
00:52:46,441 --> 00:52:47,876
What are you talking about?

706
00:52:47,908 --> 00:52:50,611
Our trackers are designed
to enter the bloodstream.

707
00:52:50,644 --> 00:52:53,981
They circulate harmlessly,
providing full audio and GPS.

708
00:52:54,011 --> 00:52:55,186
Mucus membrane.

709
00:52:55,216 --> 00:52:56,885
That's like up the nose,
isn't it?

710
00:52:56,917 --> 00:52:58,854
What the fuck am I gonna do?
Stick my finger...

711
00:53:02,723 --> 00:53:04,926
It's not just inside
the nose, is it?

712
00:53:04,959 --> 00:53:07,963
- No, Eggsy, it ain't.
- Fuck.

713
00:53:07,995 --> 00:53:09,830
All right,
I'll take the first crack.

714
00:53:09,863 --> 00:53:11,566
Watch and learn, buddy.

715
00:53:14,234 --> 00:53:15,637
Good luck.

716
00:53:21,443 --> 00:53:23,343
- Here you go, ma'am.
- Thank you.

717
00:53:23,373 --> 00:53:24,516
Miss, I beg your pardon.

718
00:53:24,546 --> 00:53:26,814
Now, I don't
wanna pester you...

719
00:53:26,847 --> 00:53:28,716
but I just have to know,
what time are you playing?

720
00:53:29,883 --> 00:53:31,519
I'm not in a band.

721
00:53:31,553 --> 00:53:33,020
God.
Who did you think I was?

722
00:53:33,053 --> 00:53:34,454
Please don't say
someone ghastly.

723
00:53:34,488 --> 00:53:37,158
God damn it,
now I feel like a fool.

724
00:53:37,191 --> 00:53:41,562
I just assumed that a woman
with your charisma...

725
00:53:41,595 --> 00:53:43,731
well, she just had
to be somebody.

726
00:53:43,765 --> 00:53:44,965
Right.

727
00:53:45,303 --> 00:53:46,503
Thank you.

728
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:48,035
No, it's okay.
I know you didn't mean

729
00:53:48,068 --> 00:53:49,336
to make me feel
like a dumbass.

730
00:53:49,370 --> 00:53:50,604
So I'll let you
make it up to me

731
00:53:50,638 --> 00:53:52,473
by letting me
buy you a drink.

732
00:53:53,140 --> 00:53:54,475
Follow my finger.

733
00:53:58,979 --> 00:54:01,014
What are we doing?

734
00:54:01,048 --> 00:54:03,083
Swiping to the left.

735
00:54:03,117 --> 00:54:05,220
What, you don't do
Tinder in America?

736
00:54:05,252 --> 00:54:06,588
Tinder what?

737
00:54:06,620 --> 00:54:09,624
Do you know, I think it's
probably a generational thing.

738
00:54:09,656 --> 00:54:12,627
It translates as
"Go away, old man."

739
00:54:16,030 --> 00:54:17,265
Be good, be cool.

740
00:54:17,698 --> 00:54:18,898
Bye.

741
00:54:20,200 --> 00:54:22,036
Thank you for that.

742
00:54:22,069 --> 00:54:24,205
- I'm Clara.
- River.

743
00:54:24,238 --> 00:54:27,207
Bloody hell, is that the time?

744
00:54:27,237 --> 00:54:28,346
You know what,
I'm so jetlagged

745
00:54:28,376 --> 00:54:30,310
I don't know
if I'm coming or going.

746
00:54:30,345 --> 00:54:31,913
Where've you been?
Anywhere nice?

747
00:54:31,946 --> 00:54:35,216
South America. Been spending
a bit of time out there.

748
00:54:35,249 --> 00:54:36,484
Training with the shaman,

749
00:54:36,517 --> 00:54:38,753
and trying to really connect
with my spirit animal.

750
00:54:38,787 --> 00:54:40,922
- Yeah.
- I'm a crow.

751
00:54:40,955 --> 00:54:42,658
And, hang on, let me guess...

752
00:54:42,691 --> 00:54:44,292
- No.
- Jaguar.

753
00:54:44,325 --> 00:54:46,428
What? No! My God!

754
00:54:46,461 --> 00:54:48,530
- Yes?
- How did you even know that?

755
00:54:48,562 --> 00:54:51,231
Look, it totally is.
Check it out.

756
00:54:51,265 --> 00:54:53,867
Ino Moxo.
Black jaguar. Very nice.

757
00:54:53,901 --> 00:54:57,071
You know what?
I wanna buy you a drink.

758
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,716
Eggsy sent this
from Glastonbury.

759
00:55:09,749 --> 00:55:13,321
And #bluerash is
trending on Twitter.

760
00:55:13,354 --> 00:55:15,656
Have you found any correlation
between these cases?

761
00:55:15,689 --> 00:55:17,791
Only recreational drug use.

762
00:55:20,162 --> 00:55:22,097
I know.
Not very Statesman-like.

763
00:55:22,830 --> 00:55:24,531
Tequila here...

764
00:55:24,566 --> 00:55:27,768
he is our resident bad boy.

765
00:55:27,801 --> 00:55:29,269
You don't think
this could be related

766
00:55:29,303 --> 00:55:31,472
to The Golden Circle,
do you?

767
00:55:31,506 --> 00:55:35,408
A drug cartel
poisoning its customers?

768
00:55:35,443 --> 00:55:36,745
Doesn't make sense.

769
00:55:43,684 --> 00:55:45,821
<i>Poppy, would you
pass the sugar, please?</i>

770
00:55:46,354 --> 00:55:48,022
<i>Okay.</i>

771
00:55:48,055 --> 00:55:51,760
But it's really bad for you.

772
00:55:51,792 --> 00:55:54,829
Eight times more addictive
than cocaine.

773
00:55:54,863 --> 00:55:57,499
Five times more likely
to cause death.

774
00:55:57,531 --> 00:55:59,167
But it's legal...

775
00:55:59,200 --> 00:56:01,502
so, you go ahead.
Knock yourself out.

776
00:56:02,803 --> 00:56:05,939
Don't get me started
on tobacco and alcohol.

777
00:56:05,973 --> 00:56:08,376
Peddle that stuff
and you're in Fortune 500.

778
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:10,044
But me? No!

779
00:56:10,077 --> 00:56:11,479
I'm out here hiding

780
00:56:11,513 --> 00:56:14,182
in the middle of
nowhere. Homesick.

781
00:56:14,214 --> 00:56:15,582
Because I sell drugs.

782
00:56:15,615 --> 00:56:19,119
Pops. You're doing this
because you're homesick?

783
00:56:19,153 --> 00:56:20,855
Yes.

784
00:56:20,888 --> 00:56:23,157
I want freedom.

785
00:56:23,191 --> 00:56:25,093
I want fame.

786
00:56:25,126 --> 00:56:28,495
Our profits were 250
billion dollars last year.

787
00:56:28,530 --> 00:56:29,997
I am the most successful
businesswoman

788
00:56:30,030 --> 00:56:32,166
in the world,
but nobody knows who I am.

789
00:56:32,196 --> 00:56:33,338
Pops, Pops.

790
00:56:33,368 --> 00:56:35,303
It's not long now?

791
00:56:35,336 --> 00:56:37,271
You're right, thank you.

792
00:56:37,303 --> 00:56:38,673
Sorry to interrupt you.

793
00:56:38,705 --> 00:56:41,341
You wanted to see me,
Madam Poppy?

794
00:56:41,374 --> 00:56:44,411
Yes, Angel.
In The Golden Circle...

795
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:46,613
we do not sample
the merchandise...

796
00:56:46,647 --> 00:56:49,651
and we do not break the rules.

797
00:56:49,684 --> 00:56:52,419
Which is why I have
invested in robots...

798
00:56:52,454 --> 00:56:54,789
because they are
so much more reliable

799
00:56:54,821 --> 00:56:57,124
and trustworthy
than human beings.

800
00:57:26,988 --> 00:57:28,723
No.

801
00:57:45,705 --> 00:57:48,075
Sorry we never
found your friends.

802
00:57:48,109 --> 00:57:50,311
Well, we all go on
our separate journeys...

803
00:57:50,345 --> 00:57:51,980
but, ultimately,
we'll all arrive

804
00:57:52,013 --> 00:57:53,581
at the same destination.

805
00:57:53,613 --> 00:57:56,649
Shall we check my tent?
See if they're there?

806
00:57:56,684 --> 00:57:58,954
- Yeah.
- Come on.

807
00:58:05,559 --> 00:58:07,194
This is amazing.

808
00:58:08,830 --> 00:58:10,264
Come on.

809
00:58:10,298 --> 00:58:13,334
You know what, I'm busting
for a pee actually.

810
00:58:13,367 --> 00:58:15,069
You could do it on me
if you want.

811
00:58:17,638 --> 00:58:18,973
Maybe in a bit.

812
00:58:19,707 --> 00:58:21,374
Give me a sec, yeah?

813
00:58:21,408 --> 00:58:23,912
Okay, but hurry up, River.

814
00:58:23,944 --> 00:58:26,914
Been waiting all night for you
to at least kiss me.

815
00:58:33,559 --> 00:58:34,759
Hey!

816
00:58:34,789 --> 00:58:37,758
<i>Hi, babe.
Bit of a nightmare.</i>

817
00:58:37,792 --> 00:58:39,127
<i>I've got to sleep
with a target...</i>

818
00:58:39,160 --> 00:58:41,862
<i>but I won't do it, unless
you agree that it's all right.</i>

819
00:58:41,896 --> 00:58:44,432
You've got
to be fucking kidding.

820
00:58:44,464 --> 00:58:46,267
What was I, target practice?

821
00:58:46,300 --> 00:58:48,803
<i>Babe, surely it's better that
I'm honest with you...</i>

822
00:58:48,836 --> 00:58:50,537
<i>rather than me doing it
and not telling you.</i>

823
00:58:50,571 --> 00:58:53,406
<i>Kind of got a bit of a "save
the world" situation here.</i>

824
00:58:53,441 --> 00:58:55,310
How the fuck
is screwing someone

825
00:58:55,343 --> 00:58:56,944
gonna save the world?

826
00:58:56,977 --> 00:58:58,879
Well, it's
a bit complicated...

827
00:58:58,912 --> 00:59:01,849
but trust me, I would not be
doing it if I didn't have to.

828
00:59:04,986 --> 00:59:07,421
Babe, please believe me.
I love you.

829
00:59:07,455 --> 00:59:08,656
You are the person
I wanna spend

830
00:59:08,689 --> 00:59:09,957
the rest of my life with.

831
00:59:12,026 --> 00:59:13,260
Is that a proposal?

832
00:59:16,530 --> 00:59:18,365
<i>Because I think I'd give you
my permission.</i>

833
00:59:18,399 --> 00:59:22,203
<i>Having that security, knowing
that we were committed...</i>

834
00:59:22,236 --> 00:59:25,205
<i>In that context, yeah.
Yeah, I'd feel different.</i>

835
00:59:26,274 --> 00:59:28,243
Right. Well, I mean...

836
00:59:28,273 --> 00:59:29,413
I want to be with you,

837
00:59:29,443 --> 00:59:31,044
but being
a public figure, babe...

838
00:59:31,079 --> 00:59:32,314
like a prince...

839
00:59:33,285 --> 00:59:34,485
It's a bit of a factor,
you know,

840
00:59:34,515 --> 00:59:35,817
what with my job and stuff.

841
00:59:37,450 --> 00:59:39,620
No, no, no, come on. Okay.

842
00:59:39,653 --> 00:59:41,688
Look, we need to talk
about this properly.

843
00:59:41,722 --> 00:59:43,824
Just give me
five minutes, okay?

844
00:59:44,725 --> 00:59:47,428
<i>Don't put
yourself down, Eggsy.</i>

845
00:59:47,461 --> 00:59:49,697
<i>I'm sure you can last
longer than that.</i>

846
01:00:15,923 --> 01:00:18,593
- What's the matter?
- Nothing.

847
01:00:18,626 --> 01:00:20,026
I just feel that
our spirit animals

848
01:00:20,060 --> 01:00:21,729
need more time
to get in sync...

849
01:00:21,763 --> 01:00:25,132
and find a harmonious bond
on the spiritual plane.

850
01:00:25,164 --> 01:00:26,367
Totally.

851
01:00:26,399 --> 01:00:27,767
Yeah?

852
01:00:27,801 --> 01:00:30,305
Or we could just...

853
01:00:31,571 --> 01:00:32,874
fuck?

854
01:00:32,875 --> 01:00:37,875
Subrip: P i x

855
01:00:38,646 --> 01:00:39,948
Clara, I don't think I can.

856
01:00:49,756 --> 01:00:51,691
But you know what?

857
01:00:51,725 --> 01:00:54,194
My crow is looking
for a place to nest.

858
01:01:38,039 --> 01:01:39,372
Good work, Eggsy!

859
01:01:39,406 --> 01:01:40,774
Tracker fully functional.

860
01:01:42,977 --> 01:01:45,847
Don't worry, I've been through
this with Whiskey before.

861
01:01:46,847 --> 01:01:48,248
Nice to be working
with an agent

862
01:01:48,283 --> 01:01:50,017
who knows what he's doing.

863
01:01:50,984 --> 01:01:54,622
<i>Mr. Crow. My turn.</i>

864
01:01:54,655 --> 01:01:56,523
I'm sorry. I can't.

865
01:01:56,557 --> 01:01:57,825
I'm in a relationship.

866
01:01:57,859 --> 01:02:00,228
That's adorable.
Listen, so am I.

867
01:02:00,260 --> 01:02:03,997
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

868
01:02:04,597 --> 01:02:05,833
I can't.

869
01:02:06,300 --> 01:02:07,500
Bye, Clara.

870
01:02:12,839 --> 01:02:14,040
<i>This is Princess T,</i>

871
01:02:14,075 --> 01:02:15,376
<i>please leave a message.</i>

872
01:02:17,611 --> 01:02:18,912
<i>Motor Manor Hotel...</i>

873
01:02:18,946 --> 01:02:21,147
Yeah, can you put me through
to Princess Tilde, please.

874
01:02:21,182 --> 01:02:23,884
Actually, sir, I'm just
looking at my computer...

875
01:02:23,917 --> 01:02:25,452
and I'm afraid
that the princess

876
01:02:25,482 --> 01:02:26,657
is already checked out.

877
01:02:26,687 --> 01:02:27,889
<i>Thank you.</i>

878
01:02:30,524 --> 01:02:31,724
Fuck!

879
01:02:58,685 --> 01:02:59,888
Harry.

880
01:03:01,955 --> 01:03:04,224
- What's going on?
- I was just packing.

881
01:03:04,258 --> 01:03:05,458
Look at these
lovely toiletries

882
01:03:05,493 --> 01:03:07,761
Merlin very kindly gave me
as a leaving present.

883
01:03:07,794 --> 01:03:09,030
Here, try this aftershave.

884
01:03:10,196 --> 01:03:11,899
Yeah, I know, Harry.
I'm wearing it.

885
01:03:14,801 --> 01:03:16,171
Listen, you can't
just give up.

886
01:03:17,343 --> 01:03:18,543
Give up?

887
01:03:18,573 --> 01:03:21,676
No, on the contrary. I'm
about to achieve my dream.

888
01:03:21,709 --> 01:03:22,943
Researching rare butterflies

889
01:03:22,977 --> 01:03:25,413
alongside some of the finest
minds in entomology.

890
01:03:35,122 --> 01:03:38,760
You know, you may as well
have me stuck up on this wall.

891
01:03:38,792 --> 01:03:42,396
'Cause you're never gonna find a
butterfly more interesting than me.

892
01:03:42,426 --> 01:03:43,534
Sorry?

893
01:03:43,564 --> 01:03:48,035
When you and I first met,
I was just, like, a maggot.

894
01:03:48,068 --> 01:03:49,437
Maggots turn into flies.

895
01:03:49,470 --> 01:03:51,038
Perhaps you mean larva.

896
01:03:51,071 --> 01:03:53,006
Larva, yeah, okay.
Whatever. The point is...

897
01:03:53,039 --> 01:03:55,108
everyone wanted
to squash me.

898
01:03:56,343 --> 01:03:57,711
But not you.

899
01:03:57,745 --> 01:04:00,815
You helped me
to become a caterpillar.

900
01:04:00,847 --> 01:04:02,449
And now I've got wings.

901
01:04:03,417 --> 01:04:05,452
I'm flying higher
than I ever dreamed.

902
01:04:05,486 --> 01:04:07,288
And that is all thanks to you.

903
01:04:07,321 --> 01:04:09,356
I hate to seem rude,
but I need to finish packing

904
01:04:09,386 --> 01:04:10,561
and get some sleep.

905
01:04:10,591 --> 01:04:11,992
Harry, you can't
just walk away.

906
01:04:12,026 --> 01:04:13,594
Kingsman needs you.

907
01:04:13,627 --> 01:04:15,930
The whole world needs you.

908
01:04:18,731 --> 01:04:20,300
I need you.

909
01:04:21,169 --> 01:04:23,404
Eggy, whoever the Harry was

910
01:04:23,437 --> 01:04:25,940
that you knew,
he's gone, I'm afraid.

911
01:04:26,305 --> 01:04:27,505
Goodbye.

912
01:05:06,513 --> 01:05:07,814
That's not a martini.

913
01:05:07,847 --> 01:05:09,783
It is in Kentucky.

914
01:05:09,816 --> 01:05:11,019
Fair enough.

915
01:05:19,325 --> 01:05:20,762
<i>Here's to you, Eggsy.</i>

916
01:05:20,794 --> 01:05:23,164
You're exactly
what Kingsman needs.

917
01:05:33,841 --> 01:05:35,075
<i>This is Princess T.</i>

918
01:05:35,109 --> 01:05:36,544
<i>Please leave a message.</i>

919
01:05:40,113 --> 01:05:41,882
Can I have
another martini, please?

920
01:05:41,915 --> 01:05:43,318
Sure.

921
01:05:44,318 --> 01:05:45,518
Thanks.

922
01:05:59,399 --> 01:06:00,599
Give up.

923
01:06:35,435 --> 01:06:36,903
You know what?

924
01:06:36,937 --> 01:06:39,240
That was the best martini
I've ever had.

925
01:06:40,374 --> 01:06:41,742
Keep the change.

926
01:06:41,774 --> 01:06:43,043
Thanks.

927
01:06:57,557 --> 01:06:58,825
It's all right.
Don't panic.

928
01:06:58,859 --> 01:07:01,596
Just thought I'd bring you
a little leaving present.

929
01:07:07,167 --> 01:07:08,568
What do you think?
He's lovely, isn't he?

930
01:07:09,803 --> 01:07:11,338
Would you like to hold him?

931
01:07:14,408 --> 01:07:15,608
Hello.

932
01:07:24,484 --> 01:07:26,720
Do you think
I should shoot him?

933
01:07:26,754 --> 01:07:29,223
- Are you quite mad?
- What? What's the problem?

934
01:07:29,256 --> 01:07:31,358
- No! You can't!
- What?

935
01:07:31,392 --> 01:07:33,594
- No, you'll have to shoot me!
- Shoot you?

936
01:07:33,624 --> 01:07:34,530
Well, I will shoot you.

937
01:07:34,560 --> 01:07:36,030
No. No one's sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

938
01:07:36,060 --> 01:07:37,101
Well, what about you, Harry?

939
01:07:37,131 --> 01:07:38,533
You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!

940
01:07:38,566 --> 01:07:39,766
Do you remember?

941
01:08:02,189 --> 01:08:04,124
<i>You were sick enough
to shoot a puppy!</i>

942
01:08:32,018 --> 01:08:33,954
- It was a blank.
- Yes, Harry. Yes!

943
01:08:33,984 --> 01:08:35,058
It was a fucking blank!

944
01:08:35,088 --> 01:08:36,126
That's right. It was a blank!

945
01:08:36,156 --> 01:08:37,425
I would never hurt Mr. Pickle!

946
01:08:37,457 --> 01:08:39,292
<i>- Yes, Harry!
- He lived to a ripe old age!</i>

947
01:08:39,326 --> 01:08:40,795
He died of pancreatitis!

948
01:08:46,966 --> 01:08:48,669
You're not Mr. Pickle.

949
01:08:55,875 --> 01:08:57,075
Eggsy.

950
01:08:58,845 --> 01:09:00,313
Hello, Harry.

951
01:09:12,792 --> 01:09:14,327
Eggsy.

952
01:09:19,332 --> 01:09:21,067
- Valentine has to be stopped.
- No, I know.

953
01:09:21,102 --> 01:09:22,302
- He has a device.
- It's all right.

954
01:09:22,335 --> 01:09:24,204
It's sorted. Don't worry.

955
01:09:24,237 --> 01:09:26,240
We got a lot of
catching up to do.

956
01:09:27,006 --> 01:09:29,209
Well, well.

957
01:09:29,242 --> 01:09:31,478
I suppose I should
cancel that taxi.

958
01:09:32,179 --> 01:09:33,614
Yes.

959
01:09:33,648 --> 01:09:34,916
If you don't mind...

960
01:09:36,649 --> 01:09:37,852
Merlin.

961
01:09:39,719 --> 01:09:41,755
Welcome back...

962
01:09:41,789 --> 01:09:42,989
Galahad.

963
01:09:47,627 --> 01:09:49,563
<i>Now that we've finished
the debrief, Harry...</i>

964
01:09:49,595 --> 01:09:51,464
<i>here's a couple of
welcome back gifts.</i>

965
01:09:51,499 --> 01:09:53,134
First up...

966
01:09:53,166 --> 01:09:55,134
a brand-new Kingsman watch.

967
01:09:55,164 --> 01:09:56,306
Advanced software,

968
01:09:56,336 --> 01:09:58,405
it can hack into anything
with a microchip.

969
01:09:58,438 --> 01:09:59,805
It is the bollocks.

970
01:09:59,840 --> 01:10:01,308
And Merlin...

971
01:10:01,341 --> 01:10:02,542
I made you these.

972
01:10:05,978 --> 01:10:07,280
A...

973
01:10:25,432 --> 01:10:28,001
Thank you, Merlin, Eggsy.

974
01:10:28,035 --> 01:10:30,137
- How do I look?
- You look...

975
01:10:30,170 --> 01:10:33,974
Like some faggot lookin' for
an eye fuckin'.

976
01:10:35,741 --> 01:10:37,009
Now...

977
01:10:37,044 --> 01:10:40,247
why don't you
get out of our bar...

978
01:10:40,280 --> 01:10:43,184
before I take out
your other one?

979
01:10:43,216 --> 01:10:45,085
Now, is that any way
to welcome a visitor

980
01:10:45,117 --> 01:10:46,954
from out of town, moonshine?

981
01:10:46,987 --> 01:10:48,389
Okay.

982
01:10:49,555 --> 01:10:52,192
Suck my southern dick...

983
01:10:52,225 --> 01:10:54,060
bitch.

984
01:10:54,094 --> 01:10:56,530
I don't think
that'll be necessary.

985
01:10:57,798 --> 01:10:59,332
Good day, sir.

986
01:11:03,536 --> 01:11:05,104
Well?

987
01:11:05,139 --> 01:11:06,974
What are you ladies
waitin' for?

988
01:11:07,541 --> 01:11:08,843
Manners...

989
01:11:10,576 --> 01:11:11,776
maketh...

990
01:11:14,215 --> 01:11:15,616
man.

991
01:11:17,216 --> 01:11:18,885
Do you know what that means?

992
01:11:21,088 --> 01:11:23,023
Then let me
teach you a lesson.

993
01:11:33,465 --> 01:11:35,367
Are we going to stand
around here all day?

994
01:11:35,402 --> 01:11:36,803
Or are we going to...

995
01:11:38,405 --> 01:11:40,374
You big...

996
01:11:58,457 --> 01:12:00,393
Well, pick him up.

997
01:12:00,428 --> 01:12:03,898
Now, that is not what I call
a Kentucky welcome.

998
01:12:05,933 --> 01:12:10,069
Manners maketh man.

999
01:12:10,103 --> 01:12:11,505
Let me translate that for you.

1000
01:12:31,296 --> 01:12:32,496
What's wrong with me, Merlin?

1001
01:12:32,526 --> 01:12:33,663
I thought you fixed me?

1002
01:12:33,693 --> 01:12:35,963
Well, we rebuilt
your neural pathways.

1003
01:12:35,996 --> 01:12:38,298
But it'll take time to get
your coordination back.

1004
01:12:59,085 --> 01:13:00,720
And the phantom butterflies?

1005
01:13:00,754 --> 01:13:02,488
You will
experience episodes...

1006
01:13:02,522 --> 01:13:03,756
lapses of clarity.

1007
01:13:03,790 --> 01:13:05,859
You'll be back
to normal soon.

1008
01:13:23,009 --> 01:13:25,512
I feel like a tornado
in a trailer park.

1009
01:13:30,482 --> 01:13:33,452
<i>Mr. President,
my name is Poppy Adams.</i>

1010
01:13:33,486 --> 01:13:36,689
<i>I believe the UN has no teeth.</i>

1011
01:13:36,724 --> 01:13:38,525
<i>So I've selected you,
as leader of the free world,</i>

1012
01:13:38,558 --> 01:13:40,426
<i>to receive this communication.</i>

1013
01:13:40,460 --> 01:13:42,128
<i>And I invite you
to begin negotiations...</i>

1014
01:13:42,161 --> 01:13:46,198
on the largest scale
hostage situation in history.

1015
01:13:46,232 --> 01:13:47,433
A few weeks ago,

1016
01:13:47,466 --> 01:13:49,269
an engineered virus
was released...

1017
01:13:49,303 --> 01:13:52,104
contained in all
varieties of my product.

1018
01:13:52,139 --> 01:13:56,609
<i>Cannabis, cocaine, heroin,
opium, ecstasy...</i>

1019
01:13:56,643 --> 01:13:58,045
<i>and crystal meth.</i>

1020
01:13:59,313 --> 01:14:01,949
<i>Some of you
are already infected.</i>

1021
01:14:01,982 --> 01:14:04,018
<i>And this is
what you can expect</i>

1022
01:14:04,050 --> 01:14:05,951
<i>in the coming days.</i>

1023
01:14:05,986 --> 01:14:08,988
<i>After a brief
incubation period...</i>

1024
01:14:09,022 --> 01:14:10,991
victims present
with stage one symptoms.

1025
01:14:12,358 --> 01:14:13,560
A blue rash.

1026
01:14:14,397 --> 01:14:15,597
Next...

1027
01:14:15,627 --> 01:14:17,630
second stage symptoms appear.

1028
01:14:17,664 --> 01:14:19,433
Mania...

1029
01:14:19,465 --> 01:14:21,100
as the virus
enters the brain.

1030
01:14:21,134 --> 01:14:23,470
<i>Very distressing to the victim</i>

1031
01:14:23,502 --> 01:14:25,238
<i>and those around them.</i>

1032
01:14:26,406 --> 01:14:27,707
<i>Stage three...</i>

1033
01:14:28,913 --> 01:14:30,113
Paralysis.

1034
01:14:30,143 --> 01:14:33,013
Muscles enter a state
of catastrophic seizure.

1035
01:14:33,046 --> 01:14:35,915
And once the muscles of
the thorax become affected...

1036
01:14:35,950 --> 01:14:38,519
breathing becomes
impossible...

1037
01:14:38,551 --> 01:14:42,889
leading to a very nasty death
within 12 hours.

1038
01:14:44,692 --> 01:14:49,896
But I have good news to
the millions already affected.

1039
01:14:49,929 --> 01:14:51,664
It doesn't have
to be this way.

1040
01:14:51,698 --> 01:14:54,969
I have an antidote.

1041
01:15:09,750 --> 01:15:12,987
What have you done to me,
you fucking bitch?

1042
01:15:14,888 --> 01:15:16,622
100% effective...

1043
01:15:16,656 --> 01:15:18,392
and ready to
ship out worldwide

1044
01:15:18,424 --> 01:15:20,026
at a moment's notice.

1045
01:15:20,059 --> 01:15:22,262
- Get out of my room!
- You have my word.

1046
01:15:22,295 --> 01:15:23,964
- Get out!
- I will do this...

1047
01:15:23,996 --> 01:15:27,566
if the following
conditions are met.

1048
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,271
Get out of my fucking room!

1049
01:15:31,505 --> 01:15:34,341
<i>First, you agree
to end the war on drugs,</i>

1050
01:15:34,375 --> 01:15:35,774
<i>once and for all.</i>

1051
01:15:35,808 --> 01:15:38,512
<i>All classes of substance
are legalized...</i>

1052
01:15:38,545 --> 01:15:40,514
<i>paving the way
to a new marketplace</i>

1053
01:15:40,546 --> 01:15:43,616
<i>in which sales
are regulated and taxed...</i>

1054
01:15:43,649 --> 01:15:45,050
<i>as per alcohol.</i>

1055
01:15:45,085 --> 01:15:50,390
<i>And second, my colleagues and
I receive full legal immunity.</i>

1056
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:51,560
<i>Meet my terms...</i>

1057
01:15:51,590 --> 01:15:52,729
<i>and I look forward
to helping you</i>

1058
01:15:52,759 --> 01:15:54,861
<i>keep our beloved
country great...</i>

1059
01:15:54,893 --> 01:15:56,228
<i>boosting our ailing economy,</i>

1060
01:15:56,263 --> 01:15:59,399
<i>and easing spending
on law enforcement.</i>

1061
01:15:59,433 --> 01:16:01,769
Or continue this
blinkered, outmoded...

1062
01:16:01,801 --> 01:16:05,738
and, frankly, disastrous
exercise in prohibition...

1063
01:16:05,772 --> 01:16:08,042
and live with blood
on your hands.

1064
01:16:09,108 --> 01:16:11,644
<i>Save lives. Legalize.</i>

1065
01:16:17,183 --> 01:16:19,986
I told you that shit
was no good for you.

1066
01:16:28,862 --> 01:16:30,664
<i>Who is Poppy Adams?</i>

1067
01:16:30,697 --> 01:16:32,433
<i>After graduating
Harvard Business School...</i>

1068
01:16:32,465 --> 01:16:33,799
<i>Adams was briefly held</i>

1069
01:16:33,834 --> 01:16:35,702
<i>for serious mental
health issues...</i>

1070
01:16:35,734 --> 01:16:37,771
<i>before disappearing
without a trace.</i>

1071
01:16:37,804 --> 01:16:40,473
<i>Intelligent, ambitious,
ruthless,</i>

1072
01:16:40,506 --> 01:16:44,009
<i>lacks empathy,
superficial charm.</i>

1073
01:16:44,044 --> 01:16:47,647
<i>All the elements
of a great CEO.</i>

1074
01:16:47,679 --> 01:16:50,116
<i>Or a psychopath.</i>

1075
01:16:50,146 --> 01:16:51,154
<i>Following the broadcast</i>

1076
01:16:51,184 --> 01:16:52,752
<i>of Adams's message
to the president...</i>

1077
01:16:52,786 --> 01:16:54,955
<i>there were scenes
of chaos today...</i>

1078
01:16:54,987 --> 01:16:57,590
<i>at medical centers across the
country and around the world.</i>

1079
01:16:57,624 --> 01:16:58,925
We have
no more beds available.

1080
01:16:58,959 --> 01:17:02,028
The hospital is
at full capacity.

1081
01:17:02,062 --> 01:17:03,630
<i>The blue rash
is now being renamed</i>

1082
01:17:03,664 --> 01:17:04,930
<i>"The Dancing Disease"...</i>

1083
01:17:04,964 --> 01:17:08,368
<i>as victims begin to exhibit
stage two symptoms.</i>

1084
01:17:14,207 --> 01:17:15,942
Let's prep the cryo unit.

1085
01:17:15,975 --> 01:17:17,277
You want to freeze him?

1086
01:17:17,309 --> 01:17:18,678
Exactly.

1087
01:17:18,711 --> 01:17:19,912
<i>Victims of the virus</i>

1088
01:17:19,947 --> 01:17:22,482
<i>caused by contaminated
recreational drugs...</i>

1089
01:17:22,515 --> 01:17:26,452
<i>flooded hospitals and clinics
in fear for their lives.</i>

1090
01:17:29,555 --> 01:17:30,991
<i>Curfews and no travel orders</i>

1091
01:17:31,023 --> 01:17:32,992
<i>are being considered
as authorities assess</i>

1092
01:17:33,026 --> 01:17:34,728
<i>the scale of the disaster.</i>

1093
01:17:35,127 --> 01:17:36,796
Close it.

1094
01:17:38,197 --> 01:17:39,698
<i>But there has still been</i>

1095
01:17:39,732 --> 01:17:41,734
<i>no official response
from the president...</i>

1096
01:17:41,768 --> 01:17:44,805
<i>who remains locked
in emergency talks.</i>

1097
01:17:46,539 --> 01:17:49,175
Prepare a presidential decree.

1098
01:17:49,209 --> 01:17:51,544
Tell intelligence and law
enforcement to stand down.

1099
01:17:51,577 --> 01:17:53,679
We're gonna dance
to this lady's tune.

1100
01:17:53,709 --> 01:17:54,818
Good.

1101
01:17:54,848 --> 01:17:56,983
We can make this work.

1102
01:17:57,017 --> 01:17:58,417
We spin it
that it's not a matter

1103
01:17:58,451 --> 01:17:59,752
of negotiation
with terrorists.

1104
01:17:59,786 --> 01:18:01,755
No, what I'm proposing...

1105
01:18:01,787 --> 01:18:04,656
is we appear
to agree to her demands

1106
01:18:04,691 --> 01:18:06,093
to prevent global panic...

1107
01:18:06,125 --> 01:18:11,496
and then let the junkie scum
go down in flames.

1108
01:18:13,599 --> 01:18:15,535
Yeah.

1109
01:18:15,567 --> 01:18:19,538
Take Poppy Adams and her so-called
Golden Circle down with them.

1110
01:18:19,572 --> 01:18:24,243
No drug users, no drug trade.
It's a win-win situation here.

1111
01:18:24,277 --> 01:18:27,646
But, sir, we're not talking
about a handful of hostages.

1112
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:29,148
We could be looking
at the deaths

1113
01:18:29,182 --> 01:18:31,018
of hundreds
of millions worldwide.

1114
01:18:31,050 --> 01:18:32,317
Hundreds of millions
of criminals,

1115
01:18:32,352 --> 01:18:33,787
burdens to society.

1116
01:18:34,621 --> 01:18:36,123
Am I right, McCoy?

1117
01:18:36,153 --> 01:18:37,293
Absolutely, sir.

1118
01:18:37,323 --> 01:18:39,125
But, sir, that's...

1119
01:18:39,158 --> 01:18:41,795
What about people who were
just experimenting?

1120
01:18:41,827 --> 01:18:43,763
Folks who self-medicate?

1121
01:18:43,796 --> 01:18:46,698
Functioning
professionals? Kids?

1122
01:18:46,732 --> 01:18:48,467
Spare me the crap, Fox.

1123
01:18:48,500 --> 01:18:49,902
The fact is,

1124
01:18:49,935 --> 01:18:52,973
this presidency has just
won the war on drugs.

1125
01:18:53,005 --> 01:18:54,240
Congratulations, sir.

1126
01:18:54,808 --> 01:18:56,743
Thank you.

1127
01:18:58,711 --> 01:19:01,814
And that deserves a toast.

1128
01:19:01,849 --> 01:19:04,451
This is
totally unethical, sir.

1129
01:19:04,483 --> 01:19:06,185
Fox, shut up!

1130
01:19:06,885 --> 01:19:09,022
McCoy, declare martial law.

1131
01:19:09,055 --> 01:19:11,758
<i>We need to keep control,
commandeer stadiums,</i>

1132
01:19:11,791 --> 01:19:13,693
<i>schools, civic centers...</i>

1133
01:19:13,727 --> 01:19:15,127
<i>order a press blackout.</i>

1134
01:19:15,161 --> 01:19:16,997
<i>And put the military
on standby</i>

1135
01:19:17,030 --> 01:19:19,066
<i>to round these junkies up.</i>

1136
01:19:20,000 --> 01:19:21,768
Whether they broke
the law or not,

1137
01:19:21,801 --> 01:19:24,071
those victims
are human beings.

1138
01:19:26,339 --> 01:19:27,539
Tequila.

1139
01:19:28,541 --> 01:19:30,077
He's a great guy.

1140
01:19:31,477 --> 01:19:33,345
And a great agent.

1141
01:19:33,379 --> 01:19:37,149
Right now, he's lying in deep
freeze waitin' on our help.

1142
01:19:37,183 --> 01:19:39,585
We can't make
this personal, sir.

1143
01:19:39,618 --> 01:19:40,887
Personal?

1144
01:19:40,920 --> 01:19:43,823
Agent, we can't stand by
and let folks like him die.

1145
01:19:43,856 --> 01:19:46,393
These people,
we're their only hope.

1146
01:19:48,161 --> 01:19:49,997
Now, we have
to find that antidote.

1147
01:19:50,030 --> 01:19:52,633
Poppy's stockpiles, well,
they could be anywhere.

1148
01:19:52,666 --> 01:19:54,601
She must have some on hand.

1149
01:19:54,634 --> 01:19:56,203
Locate Poppy...

1150
01:19:57,336 --> 01:20:00,072
and obtain a sample
for analysis.

1151
01:20:00,106 --> 01:20:01,974
Maybe it can be replicated.

1152
01:20:02,008 --> 01:20:03,475
<i>Sorry to cut in, guys.</i>

1153
01:20:03,509 --> 01:20:05,045
<i>But Charlie is on the phone
with his girlfriend.</i>

1154
01:20:05,077 --> 01:20:07,312
<i>Looping you in now.</i>

1155
01:20:07,345 --> 01:20:08,915
<i>Don't worry.
I'm on a payphone...</i>

1156
01:20:08,947 --> 01:20:11,550
covered in
a fucking blue rash.

1157
01:20:11,584 --> 01:20:12,885
Why didn't you tell me?

1158
01:20:12,919 --> 01:20:15,488
<i>All you said was,
"Don't take any drugs."</i>

1159
01:20:15,522 --> 01:20:17,924
<i>It was a music festival
for fuck's sake.</i>

1160
01:20:17,956 --> 01:20:22,028
Fuck. Shit. Shit! Okay.

1161
01:20:23,162 --> 01:20:25,231
Listen. You need to get
to the lab in Italy.

1162
01:20:25,264 --> 01:20:26,767
<i>Do you remember
where we went skiing?</i>

1163
01:20:26,799 --> 01:20:29,268
Yes. Yes, I remember.

1164
01:20:29,303 --> 01:20:30,637
Yeah. Meet me there

1165
01:20:30,670 --> 01:20:32,371
and I'll give you
the antidote.

1166
01:20:33,740 --> 01:20:35,041
Okay.

1167
01:20:38,877 --> 01:20:40,713
All right. Jet's ready.

1168
01:20:40,746 --> 01:20:43,282
Whiskey, Galahad,
get to Italy.

1169
01:20:47,252 --> 01:20:49,155
You two need to fix
this code name thing.

1170
01:20:49,188 --> 01:20:50,723
And with all
due respect, sir...

1171
01:20:50,756 --> 01:20:52,058
I don't think Galahad senior

1172
01:20:52,091 --> 01:20:53,626
is ready to return
to fieldwork.

1173
01:20:54,728 --> 01:20:56,996
- I did actually mean...
- Of course.

1174
01:20:57,030 --> 01:20:59,599
And with all disrespect...

1175
01:20:59,633 --> 01:21:01,401
I'm not going anywhere
without him.

1176
01:21:02,669 --> 01:21:05,372
Brains, skills...

1177
01:21:06,572 --> 01:21:07,772
skipping rope?

1178
01:21:10,143 --> 01:21:11,944
- It's a lasso.
- Whatever.

1179
01:21:12,545 --> 01:21:13,780
Come on.

1180
01:21:15,916 --> 01:21:17,684
Go on. Vamoose.

1181
01:21:17,716 --> 01:21:18,986
Yes, sir.

1182
01:21:31,697 --> 01:21:33,066
Drink it.

1183
01:21:44,876 --> 01:21:46,478
<i>It's working already.</i>

1184
01:21:46,513 --> 01:21:48,314
<i>Thank God.</i>

1185
01:21:48,948 --> 01:21:50,148
Agent Whiskey.

1186
01:21:50,183 --> 01:21:52,752
<i>Antidote confirmed
at the target's location.</i>

1187
01:21:52,785 --> 01:21:54,121
<i>Good luck.</i>

1188
01:22:02,562 --> 01:22:04,863
Hold up. We need you
down here, Galahad.

1189
01:22:04,898 --> 01:22:06,299
To secure the control room.

1190
01:22:06,331 --> 01:22:08,067
Probably a good idea, Harry.

1191
01:22:09,001 --> 01:22:10,670
Call you from the top, yeah?

1192
01:22:19,446 --> 01:22:21,247
<i>Buongiorno!</i>

1193
01:22:21,281 --> 01:22:22,582
<i>Buongiorno.</i>

1194
01:22:35,829 --> 01:22:37,030
Hey!

1195
01:22:38,031 --> 01:22:39,232
So sorry about this.

1196
01:22:44,769 --> 01:22:47,073
At the controls. In position.

1197
01:23:06,192 --> 01:23:08,261
Keep this cable car here
till we get back.

1198
01:23:08,295 --> 01:23:09,863
<i>Roger that, Eggsy.</i>

1199
01:23:09,896 --> 01:23:11,831
Clara's definitely here.

1200
01:23:11,865 --> 01:23:13,265
We're getting warmer.

1201
01:23:18,170 --> 01:23:21,475
Harry Hart, Harry Hart,
super spy, super spy.

1202
01:23:22,341 --> 01:23:24,978
Looks like we've got a door.

1203
01:23:25,010 --> 01:23:26,213
Yep.

1204
01:23:26,978 --> 01:23:28,180
There you go.

1205
01:23:38,624 --> 01:23:40,292
I'll cover.

1206
01:23:41,428 --> 01:23:42,628
Hi, there.

1207
01:23:43,862 --> 01:23:45,530
Sorry I'm late.

1208
01:23:45,563 --> 01:23:47,966
You guys did not make
this place easy to find.

1209
01:23:48,000 --> 01:23:49,935
Who are you?

1210
01:23:49,969 --> 01:23:52,605
I'm here to collect
this antidote.

1211
01:23:52,638 --> 01:23:53,838
For Singapore?

1212
01:23:54,573 --> 01:23:55,776
Yeah.

1213
01:23:59,211 --> 01:24:02,581
You are Wu Ting Feng?

1214
01:24:06,553 --> 01:24:07,753
Yes.

1215
01:24:09,054 --> 01:24:11,323
Hey, how are you still alive?

1216
01:24:11,357 --> 01:24:13,559
River, what are you
doing here?

1217
01:24:13,589 --> 01:24:14,663
River?

1218
01:24:14,693 --> 01:24:15,928
Hi, Clara.

1219
01:24:15,961 --> 01:24:19,066
What happens at Glasto,
stays in Glasto.

1220
01:24:21,934 --> 01:24:23,702
- You motherfucker!
- Bye, Charlie.

1221
01:24:23,736 --> 01:24:25,839
Sound the alarm!

1222
01:24:25,871 --> 01:24:27,372
You fucking cockroach!

1223
01:24:27,407 --> 01:24:29,409
- Jam the door!
- Give...

1224
01:24:36,448 --> 01:24:38,050
Fuck!

1225
01:24:38,084 --> 01:24:39,952
Galahad, we're coming.

1226
01:24:39,986 --> 01:24:41,688
<i>All clear at the bottom?</i>

1227
01:24:42,621 --> 01:24:44,990
<i>Galahad, come in!</i>

1228
01:24:45,023 --> 01:24:46,825
- Open the fucking door.
- They've locked.

1229
01:24:46,858 --> 01:24:48,094
Open the door!

1230
01:24:49,961 --> 01:24:51,263
Harry, come on, we're in.
Let's go.

1231
01:24:51,296 --> 01:24:52,732
Away, butterflies.

1232
01:24:52,764 --> 01:24:55,234
Butterfly? No, Harry. You've
got to shut the doors, please.

1233
01:24:55,268 --> 01:24:57,236
<i>Come on.
We've gotta go now. Please!</i>

1234
01:24:57,268 --> 01:24:59,204
Shut the fucking door, Harry!

1235
01:24:59,237 --> 01:25:00,840
<i>Harry, are you there?</i>

1236
01:25:02,207 --> 01:25:04,544
Well done, Harry.
Good. Thanks, man.

1237
01:25:04,577 --> 01:25:05,777
Come on. Now!

1238
01:25:07,947 --> 01:25:09,316
- It's done.
- Thank you.

1239
01:25:33,171 --> 01:25:34,874
You all good
down there, Harry?

1240
01:25:34,907 --> 01:25:36,142
All clear.

1241
01:25:41,680 --> 01:25:42,880
<i>Hello, Eggsy.</i>

1242
01:25:44,049 --> 01:25:46,152
Enjoy the ride, bruv.

1243
01:25:55,161 --> 01:25:56,363
Shit.

1244
01:26:05,405 --> 01:26:07,307
All the buttons are dead.
Controls gone.

1245
01:26:07,340 --> 01:26:09,576
Everything's in shutdown.
You're on your own, Eggsy.

1246
01:26:55,220 --> 01:26:56,455
What the fuck is that?

1247
01:27:12,705 --> 01:27:13,905
My God.

1248
01:27:47,674 --> 01:27:49,743
You've gotta be
fucking kidding!

1249
01:28:08,527 --> 01:28:10,396
- Jesus fucking Christ!
- What the fuck is that?

1250
01:28:10,429 --> 01:28:12,732
What the hell is that?

1251
01:28:12,764 --> 01:28:13,964
Shit!

1252
01:28:39,023 --> 01:28:43,829
That's the first decent shit
I've had in three weeks.

1253
01:28:48,433 --> 01:28:50,836
Harry, meet us at the
emergency rendezvous point.

1254
01:28:50,870 --> 01:28:52,070
Roger that.

1255
01:28:52,772 --> 01:28:54,040
Got you on the GPS.

1256
01:29:22,835 --> 01:29:24,504
So weird to think
this tiny thing

1257
01:29:24,536 --> 01:29:26,238
could save the world.

1258
01:29:26,272 --> 01:29:28,040
Let me have a look.

1259
01:29:31,743 --> 01:29:32,943
Harry.

1260
01:29:37,316 --> 01:29:38,818
Am I late?

1261
01:29:39,618 --> 01:29:40,853
You found the antidote.

1262
01:29:43,790 --> 01:29:44,990
Get down!

1263
01:30:01,974 --> 01:30:03,343
You fucking dickhead!

1264
01:30:03,375 --> 01:30:04,842
Fuck you!
I just saved your life!

1265
01:30:04,876 --> 01:30:07,080
Yeah, and cost millions
of people theirs!

1266
01:30:20,660 --> 01:30:23,629
All right, they're going
for cover and reloading.

1267
01:30:23,662 --> 01:30:25,898
I'll fix their wagons.
Cover me, boys!

1268
01:30:28,771 --> 01:30:29,971
Wait.

1269
01:30:30,001 --> 01:30:32,571
Eggsy, I think he could be
working for the other side.

1270
01:30:32,604 --> 01:30:34,439
What the fuck
is wrong with you?

1271
01:30:34,473 --> 01:30:37,009
You're having
a brain fart! Look!

1272
01:30:37,042 --> 01:30:40,580
Does that look like
he's working with them?

1273
01:30:40,612 --> 01:30:43,548
Harry, are you seeing
butterflies again?

1274
01:30:43,581 --> 01:30:44,983
I know what I'm seeing.

1275
01:31:36,868 --> 01:31:39,438
Good job
he didn't need our help.

1276
01:31:39,472 --> 01:31:42,207
Thank fucking Christ
I didn't need any backup!

1277
01:31:48,581 --> 01:31:51,016
I'm out of ammo!
Troop carrier coming in.

1278
01:31:51,049 --> 01:31:52,249
What've you got?

1279
01:31:53,986 --> 01:31:55,186
Fuck!

1280
01:31:59,259 --> 01:32:00,894
Shit!
There's a fuck ton of 'em!

1281
01:32:04,229 --> 01:32:05,865
What is this?

1282
01:32:05,898 --> 01:32:08,868
Looks like you packed for a fucking
slumber party, not a mission!

1283
01:32:09,969 --> 01:32:12,838
And they've got
fucking Gatling guns!

1284
01:32:12,871 --> 01:32:16,174
You have 10 seconds to
surrender before we open fire!

1285
01:32:16,204 --> 01:32:17,345
Guys, hurry up!

1286
01:32:17,375 --> 01:32:18,413
10!

1287
01:32:18,443 --> 01:32:19,844
Hey!

1288
01:32:19,879 --> 01:32:22,015
-9!
- Butterfly guy!

1289
01:32:23,287 --> 01:32:24,487
8!

1290
01:32:24,517 --> 01:32:26,419
You don't look like
Ginger fixed you right.

1291
01:32:26,449 --> 01:32:27,555
7!

1292
01:32:27,585 --> 01:32:28,725
I said I'm empty!

1293
01:32:28,755 --> 01:32:30,256
-6!
- Give me yours.

1294
01:32:30,561 --> 01:32:31,761
5!

1295
01:32:31,791 --> 01:32:33,125
Harry, give him
the fucking gun!

1296
01:32:33,157 --> 01:32:34,357
4!

1297
01:32:35,627 --> 01:32:38,063
Harry, no!

1298
01:32:42,201 --> 01:32:43,636
Fuck it! Fire!

1299
01:32:43,670 --> 01:32:44,904
Harry, get down!

1300
01:32:52,411 --> 01:32:53,812
I mean, honestly, Harry,

1301
01:32:53,845 --> 01:32:55,281
what the fuck
is wrong with you?

1302
01:32:55,313 --> 01:32:57,682
He broke the vial on purpose!

1303
01:32:57,716 --> 01:33:00,118
You're a fucking idiot!
You're out of control, Harry!

1304
01:33:00,152 --> 01:33:02,221
If we made it out of here,
he was gonna kill us both!

1305
01:33:07,093 --> 01:33:09,629
For fuck's sake, it looks like
he wouldn't have fucking had to!

1306
01:33:09,661 --> 01:33:11,097
Ye of little faith.

1307
01:33:32,785 --> 01:33:35,153
This does not mean
you're off the fucking hook!

1308
01:33:36,121 --> 01:33:37,590
We need to go dark.

1309
01:33:37,622 --> 01:33:38,857
We don't know
who else at Statesman

1310
01:33:38,890 --> 01:33:41,359
could be working against us.

1311
01:33:41,389 --> 01:33:42,497
Shit! This is all my fault.

1312
01:33:42,527 --> 01:33:43,599
You weren't ready
for the field

1313
01:33:43,629 --> 01:33:44,699
and I pushed for it!

1314
01:33:44,729 --> 01:33:45,801
He showed his hand.

1315
01:33:45,831 --> 01:33:47,633
You think
he'd have let us live?

1316
01:33:47,666 --> 01:33:49,667
You should be thanking me
for saving our arses!

1317
01:33:49,697 --> 01:33:50,773
Saving our arses?

1318
01:33:50,803 --> 01:33:52,338
Try saying that
to fucking Whiskey!

1319
01:34:02,548 --> 01:34:04,951
You are unbelievable!

1320
01:34:04,983 --> 01:34:06,852
<i>- Merlin, can you hear me?
- Yes, Eggsy.</i>

1321
01:34:06,885 --> 01:34:08,187
Whiskey's down.
He's been shot.

1322
01:34:08,687 --> 01:34:10,089
What happened?

1323
01:34:16,961 --> 01:34:19,831
He got caught
in the crossfire.

1324
01:34:19,865 --> 01:34:21,901
<i>I've applied the alpha gel.
We'll bring him in.</i>

1325
01:34:21,933 --> 01:34:23,768
But first, I've gotta find a
way to get back up to that lab

1326
01:34:23,803 --> 01:34:25,604
and retrieve more antidote.

1327
01:34:28,307 --> 01:34:31,410
<i>Charlie, what's
happening? Where are you?</i>

1328
01:34:31,442 --> 01:34:33,044
<i>Everything's under control.</i>

1329
01:34:33,077 --> 01:34:35,781
I'm sorry, Charlie.
I'm so sorry.

1330
01:34:35,813 --> 01:34:38,082
<i>Please don't tell Poppy
it was me they followed.</i>

1331
01:34:38,116 --> 01:34:39,584
<i>Don't worry, darling.</i>

1332
01:34:39,618 --> 01:34:41,620
<i>What happens in Italy...</i>

1333
01:34:44,122 --> 01:34:45,357
<i>stays in Italy.</i>

1334
01:34:46,524 --> 01:34:47,759
Thank you.

1335
01:35:00,907 --> 01:35:05,478
Merlin, change of plans.
Wu Ting Feng, Singapore.

1336
01:35:05,510 --> 01:35:06,745
<i>- Who?
- Exactly.</i>

1337
01:35:06,778 --> 01:35:08,446
It's the only
lead we've got.

1338
01:35:08,481 --> 01:35:10,148
So I suggest
you find out who he is.

1339
01:35:12,049 --> 01:35:13,249
Come on.

1340
01:35:17,089 --> 01:35:19,858
Wu Ting Feng, he's
an assistant at a law firm.

1341
01:35:19,890 --> 01:35:21,527
Let's get through
their firewall.

1342
01:35:21,559 --> 01:35:22,794
Yep.

1343
01:35:23,696 --> 01:35:24,930
Merlin...

1344
01:35:24,963 --> 01:35:27,433
have you ever wanted
to do more than this?

1345
01:35:28,433 --> 01:35:30,035
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

1346
01:35:30,065 --> 01:35:31,006
This is vital.

1347
01:35:31,036 --> 01:35:32,704
Without us, they'd be lost.

1348
01:35:32,737 --> 01:35:35,039
I know, but you know
what I mean.

1349
01:35:35,073 --> 01:35:37,475
Get out there
in the field.

1350
01:35:37,505 --> 01:35:38,680
Well, have you ever asked?

1351
01:35:38,710 --> 01:35:39,946
Of course I have.

1352
01:35:39,978 --> 01:35:42,414
But every time an agent's
position has come up...

1353
01:35:42,447 --> 01:35:45,250
Whiskey has voted
against me.

1354
01:35:45,283 --> 01:35:47,184
- No.
- Yeah.

1355
01:35:47,219 --> 01:35:49,488
Wait, wait, wait.
Look, check it out.

1356
01:35:49,518 --> 01:35:50,592
Email in from Poppy,

1357
01:35:50,622 --> 01:35:52,491
from a senior partner
at the firm.

1358
01:35:53,925 --> 01:35:55,460
They're coordinates.

1359
01:35:59,064 --> 01:36:00,299
Cambodia?

1360
01:36:01,366 --> 01:36:03,835
You have any reconnaissance
drones down in Asia?

1361
01:36:03,868 --> 01:36:05,537
Sure do.
Sending them in right now.

1362
01:36:12,309 --> 01:36:13,879
<i>The government today urged</i>

1363
01:36:13,909 --> 01:36:15,082
<i>Golden Circle victims...</i>

1364
01:36:15,112 --> 01:36:17,048
<i>to report to
the temporary field hospitals</i>

1365
01:36:17,081 --> 01:36:19,951
<i>now set up across the country.</i>

1366
01:36:19,984 --> 01:36:21,786
<i>The president's
handling of the crisis</i>

1367
01:36:21,819 --> 01:36:24,590
<i>has been commended
by other world leaders.</i>

1368
01:36:24,624 --> 01:36:27,359
Damn. Politics has
never been so easy.

1369
01:36:27,393 --> 01:36:29,528
Jesus, Fox.

1370
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:30,862
What?

1371
01:36:38,804 --> 01:36:40,173
God.

1372
01:36:44,881 --> 01:36:46,081
Like I said, sir...

1373
01:36:46,111 --> 01:36:48,814
this affects all people
from all backgrounds.

1374
01:36:48,847 --> 01:36:50,648
I'm disappointed, Fox.

1375
01:36:50,682 --> 01:36:52,550
Disappointed and disgusted.

1376
01:36:52,584 --> 01:36:55,588
Mr. President,
I routinely work

1377
01:36:55,621 --> 01:36:58,056
a 20 hour day for you,
7 days a week.

1378
01:36:58,090 --> 01:37:01,227
Maybe some can do that
without chemical help.

1379
01:37:01,259 --> 01:37:04,396
Countless people
are going to die.

1380
01:37:04,429 --> 01:37:06,064
You can save them, sir.

1381
01:37:06,965 --> 01:37:08,568
Innocent people like me.

1382
01:37:10,935 --> 01:37:12,839
Not that innocent.

1383
01:37:43,272 --> 01:37:44,472
He looks great.

1384
01:37:44,502 --> 01:37:45,702
Good.

1385
01:37:50,875 --> 01:37:52,243
Good news, gentlemen.

1386
01:37:52,277 --> 01:37:53,879
He'll be back on
his feet in no time.

1387
01:37:53,912 --> 01:37:55,880
I'm not certain
that's a good idea.

1388
01:37:55,910 --> 01:37:57,019
What do you mean?

1389
01:37:57,049 --> 01:37:59,085
I shot Agent Whiskey.
Deliberately.

1390
01:37:59,422 --> 01:38:00,622
What, why?

1391
01:38:00,652 --> 01:38:01,853
He was working against us.

1392
01:38:01,888 --> 01:38:03,988
And until we find out why,
I say we trust no one.

1393
01:38:04,022 --> 01:38:06,157
Merlin, Harry's sick.

1394
01:38:06,191 --> 01:38:08,059
This whole thing
is my fault.

1395
01:38:08,093 --> 01:38:09,594
I thought he was ready.

1396
01:38:14,899 --> 01:38:17,469
I'm sorry,
I've got to take this.

1397
01:38:17,502 --> 01:38:18,903
Listen to me.

1398
01:38:18,937 --> 01:38:20,539
This is not about
my mental health.

1399
01:38:20,572 --> 01:38:23,175
If there's a chance there's
a double agent in our midst...

1400
01:38:23,207 --> 01:38:27,879
or worse, if Statesman itself
has a dark agenda...

1401
01:38:27,912 --> 01:38:29,580
we have to safeguard
this mission.

1402
01:38:29,613 --> 01:38:33,551
We both know the president
wants these victims dead.

1403
01:38:33,585 --> 01:38:34,953
Hey, baby.

1404
01:38:36,921 --> 01:38:38,156
<i>Hey.</i>

1405
01:38:40,229 --> 01:38:41,429
Fuck.

1406
01:38:41,459 --> 01:38:44,262
Look, Harry, I trust you.
I always have.

1407
01:38:44,295 --> 01:38:48,899
But it's about this situation.
We need Statesman's resources.

1408
01:38:48,933 --> 01:38:51,001
And I need to know
that you are fit for work.

1409
01:38:51,036 --> 01:38:52,771
Babe, why didn't
you call me?

1410
01:38:52,804 --> 01:38:54,305
<i>Are you the banana man?</i>

1411
01:38:54,339 --> 01:38:55,841
Listen, we're on
the verge of finding

1412
01:38:55,874 --> 01:38:57,475
an antidote.
It's gonna be all right.

1413
01:38:57,505 --> 01:38:58,380
Now, look left for me.

1414
01:38:58,410 --> 01:38:59,678
There's nothing wrong
with my brain.

1415
01:38:59,711 --> 01:39:01,178
Look right.

1416
01:39:01,213 --> 01:39:02,481
Can you remember
the headline

1417
01:39:02,514 --> 01:39:04,250
when you uncovered that
spy ring in the Pentagon?

1418
01:39:04,282 --> 01:39:06,417
The football.
England beat Germany, 5-1.

1419
01:39:06,451 --> 01:39:07,952
Thatcher's
assassination attempt.

1420
01:39:07,982 --> 01:39:09,056
Charles and Di's wedding.

1421
01:39:09,086 --> 01:39:10,656
<i>Hey, Bjorn Borg.</i>

1422
01:39:21,166 --> 01:39:22,902
Babe, if you can hear me,

1423
01:39:22,934 --> 01:39:25,204
I want you to know
that I love you.

1424
01:39:25,237 --> 01:39:27,273
<i>And if we get through this,
and you'll have me back...</i>

1425
01:39:27,305 --> 01:39:30,142
<i>I wanna be with you.
No matter what.</i>

1426
01:39:30,172 --> 01:39:31,246
I promise
I won't let you down.

1427
01:39:31,276 --> 01:39:32,877
It's all gonna be all right.

1428
01:39:32,911 --> 01:39:34,312
My favorite singer.

1429
01:39:34,345 --> 01:39:36,581
I don't bloody know.
How would I know that?

1430
01:39:36,615 --> 01:39:38,917
- It's John Denver.
- Merlin!

1431
01:39:38,951 --> 01:39:40,953
Have you got eyes
on that location yet?

1432
01:39:40,987 --> 01:39:43,055
Soon. The reconnaissance
drone's about an hour away.

1433
01:39:43,085 --> 01:39:44,225
Which gives us time
to sort out...

1434
01:39:44,255 --> 01:39:45,957
Bollocks, we haven't
time for anything.

1435
01:39:45,991 --> 01:39:48,294
I'm leaving now.
With or without you.

1436
01:40:06,277 --> 01:40:08,213
Hello!

1437
01:40:08,246 --> 01:40:09,615
Identify yourself.

1438
01:40:09,648 --> 01:40:14,185
My name is Stacey Prewitt.
I'm Ms. Poppy Adams' attorney.

1439
01:40:14,219 --> 01:40:16,288
Poppy, you expecting
a lawyer tonight?

1440
01:40:16,321 --> 01:40:18,357
Yes. Please send him in.

1441
01:40:18,389 --> 01:40:21,493
<i>But don't forget to
reactivate the landmines.</i>

1442
01:40:26,831 --> 01:40:28,365
Good evening, Ms. Adams.

1443
01:40:28,399 --> 01:40:33,671
<i>My lawyer is bringing you
the document right now.</i>

1444
01:40:33,705 --> 01:40:35,174
<i>Hurry up.</i>

1445
01:40:35,204 --> 01:40:36,311
<i>And once you countersign,</i>

1446
01:40:36,341 --> 01:40:37,675
<i>it becomes
an executive decree...</i>

1447
01:40:37,705 --> 01:40:38,814
<i>and you can't back out,</i>

1448
01:40:38,844 --> 01:40:40,145
<i>and then I release
the antidote.</i>

1449
01:40:40,178 --> 01:40:41,513
Can you give me any assurance

1450
01:40:41,546 --> 01:40:43,314
you can get it
out there in time?

1451
01:40:43,344 --> 01:40:44,420
<i>And where's it
gonna come from?</i>

1452
01:40:44,450 --> 01:40:45,783
<i>How long it'll take
to distribute?</i>

1453
01:40:45,817 --> 01:40:48,420
I wouldn't worry about that.
I have secure stockpiles...

1454
01:40:48,454 --> 01:40:51,490
hidden in every
major city worldwide.

1455
01:40:51,523 --> 01:40:53,926
And when I enter
the access code...

1456
01:40:53,959 --> 01:40:55,359
my fleet of drones

1457
01:40:55,393 --> 01:40:58,263
will distribute
the antidote immediately.

1458
01:40:58,295 --> 01:41:00,798
So don't dilly-dally
signin' that document

1459
01:41:00,832 --> 01:41:02,600
'cause time is running out.

1460
01:41:05,438 --> 01:41:06,772
You dumb bitch!

1461
01:41:16,749 --> 01:41:17,949
You all right?

1462
01:41:19,852 --> 01:41:21,887
What was that
phone call you got?

1463
01:41:21,920 --> 01:41:24,189
Let's not, Harry.

1464
01:41:24,222 --> 01:41:25,523
I don't think
you'd sympathize...

1465
01:41:25,557 --> 01:41:27,725
and I'm not really in
the mood for a lecture.

1466
01:41:31,729 --> 01:41:32,929
All right.

1467
01:41:35,634 --> 01:41:38,571
How about a martini?
For old times' sake?

1468
01:41:40,671 --> 01:41:41,871
Yeah, all right.

1469
01:41:54,853 --> 01:41:56,822
I had a girlfriend.

1470
01:41:59,457 --> 01:42:00,657
I lost her.

1471
01:42:01,559 --> 01:42:03,129
And it broke me.

1472
01:42:05,097 --> 01:42:07,532
And now,
if this mission fails...

1473
01:42:08,966 --> 01:42:10,301
she's gonna die.

1474
01:42:12,304 --> 01:42:14,607
I know it's against
Kingsman rules,

1475
01:42:14,639 --> 01:42:16,674
having a relationship.

1476
01:42:20,679 --> 01:42:22,480
When I was shot...

1477
01:42:22,514 --> 01:42:24,082
can you guess
what the last thing was

1478
01:42:24,115 --> 01:42:25,584
that flashed through my mind?

1479
01:42:28,053 --> 01:42:31,756
It was absolutely nothing.

1480
01:42:34,026 --> 01:42:35,728
I had no ties.

1481
01:42:36,428 --> 01:42:39,397
No bittersweet memories.

1482
01:42:39,429 --> 01:42:41,499
I was leaving nothing behind.

1483
01:42:43,468 --> 01:42:45,738
Never experienced
companionship...

1484
01:42:46,737 --> 01:42:48,273
never been in love...

1485
01:42:49,374 --> 01:42:51,309
and in that moment...

1486
01:42:51,343 --> 01:42:55,046
all I felt was loneliness...

1487
01:42:55,080 --> 01:42:56,314
and regret.

1488
01:42:57,950 --> 01:42:59,483
I'm sorry.

1489
01:42:59,518 --> 01:43:00,718
Don't be.

1490
01:43:02,754 --> 01:43:05,291
Just know that
having something to lose...

1491
01:43:07,358 --> 01:43:09,794
is what makes life
worth living.

1492
01:43:10,661 --> 01:43:12,764
Now, let's go
and save your girl.

1493
01:43:14,099 --> 01:43:15,801
I missed you, Harry.

1494
01:43:21,005 --> 01:43:22,406
Gentlemen.

1495
01:43:22,439 --> 01:43:24,343
I hate to break up a party.

1496
01:43:24,375 --> 01:43:27,512
We're nearly there,
so I suggest we get ready.

1497
01:43:28,813 --> 01:43:30,013
Follow me.

1498
01:43:39,624 --> 01:43:41,727
Yes.

1499
01:43:51,202 --> 01:43:52,803
Hello, gorgeous.

1500
01:43:52,833 --> 01:43:53,975
I'm Jack. What's your name?

1501
01:43:54,005 --> 01:43:56,307
How would you like to ride
home on a real cowboy?

1502
01:43:56,341 --> 01:43:57,910
I got a six pack
of cold ones on ice

1503
01:43:57,940 --> 01:43:59,113
and my roomie's
out all night.

1504
01:43:59,143 --> 01:44:02,379
So you can scream my name
as loud as you need to, sugar.

1505
01:44:02,414 --> 01:44:05,184
I hate to do this
to you, Jack.

1506
01:44:05,214 --> 01:44:06,320
Who's this pretty lady?

1507
01:44:06,350 --> 01:44:07,752
She's dead.

1508
01:44:07,786 --> 01:44:10,388
Cops said wrong place,
wrong time.

1509
01:44:10,420 --> 01:44:12,557
Hey, honey. I'm heading
to the grocery store.

1510
01:44:17,528 --> 01:44:18,897
<i>My name is Poppy Adams.</i>

1511
01:44:35,685 --> 01:44:36,885
Ginger.

1512
01:44:36,915 --> 01:44:40,352
Goddamn butterfly guy shot me
in the fucking head.

1513
01:44:40,384 --> 01:44:41,853
Why would he do that?

1514
01:44:44,456 --> 01:44:46,858
Well, I'm guessing
you didn't fix him right.

1515
01:44:46,892 --> 01:44:48,493
And where the hell is he?

1516
01:44:48,527 --> 01:44:52,230
He's on his way to Cambodia
with Eggsy and Merlin.

1517
01:44:52,263 --> 01:44:54,299
That's where Poppy's base is.

1518
01:44:54,332 --> 01:44:56,033
Eggsy's gonna need backup.

1519
01:44:56,067 --> 01:44:57,301
Yes, he is.

1520
01:44:57,335 --> 01:44:58,771
<i>Get the Silver Pony
on the runway</i>

1521
01:44:58,804 --> 01:45:00,005
and ready to take off.

1522
01:45:10,749 --> 01:45:12,050
Hey, hey.

1523
01:45:12,082 --> 01:45:14,652
Looking good, Merlin.

1524
01:45:15,319 --> 01:45:17,188
Feeling good, Eggsy.

1525
01:45:20,224 --> 01:45:22,493
Right. This is yours.

1526
01:45:23,896 --> 01:45:25,096
That's for you.

1527
01:45:37,843 --> 01:45:39,545
Press the "S".

1528
01:45:40,310 --> 01:45:41,880
Minesweeper.

1529
01:45:41,912 --> 01:45:43,880
Courtesy of Statesman.

1530
01:45:43,915 --> 01:45:46,151
- And what about these?
- Careful.

1531
01:45:46,183 --> 01:45:47,652
Those are hand grenades.

1532
01:45:49,920 --> 01:45:51,889
As discussed...

1533
01:45:51,923 --> 01:45:53,123
this is for the endgame.

1534
01:45:53,991 --> 01:45:55,526
I'm entrusting it to you.

1535
01:46:02,200 --> 01:46:04,670
And I'm entrusting this...

1536
01:46:07,606 --> 01:46:08,806
to me.

1537
01:46:31,063 --> 01:46:34,899
<i>Millions of Golden Circle
victims worldwide...</i>

1538
01:46:34,933 --> 01:46:37,736
<i>are now entering
stage three paralysis.</i>

1539
01:46:40,275 --> 01:46:41,475
<i>In his latest statement...</i>

1540
01:46:41,505 --> 01:46:43,075
<i>the president promised
he was doing</i>

1541
01:46:43,107 --> 01:46:44,474
<i>everything in his power...</i>

1542
01:46:44,509 --> 01:46:47,646
<i>to speed up negotiations
and save lives.</i>

1543
01:46:47,679 --> 01:46:49,347
<i>But fears are growing
that for many,</i>

1544
01:46:49,380 --> 01:46:51,149
<i>it may soon be too late.</i>

1545
01:46:51,183 --> 01:46:54,352
<i>Our thoughts and prayers
are with the victims.</i>

1546
01:46:54,384 --> 01:46:55,653
<i>God help us all.</i>

1547
01:47:38,830 --> 01:47:40,866
Right.
This is where we split up.

1548
01:47:40,898 --> 01:47:42,299
Pincer movement.

1549
01:47:42,332 --> 01:47:43,667
Merlin, you're with me.

1550
01:47:43,701 --> 01:47:45,904
Eggsy, you signal
when we're in position.

1551
01:47:54,112 --> 01:47:56,181
Don't move.

1552
01:47:57,215 --> 01:47:59,918
You move, we die.

1553
01:48:08,359 --> 01:48:10,528
Luckily, I have this.

1554
01:48:18,870 --> 01:48:22,640
This spray will freeze
the trigger mechanism...

1555
01:48:22,674 --> 01:48:25,743
give us a split second.

1556
01:48:26,545 --> 01:48:29,047
So on the count of three...

1557
01:48:29,080 --> 01:48:30,348
what I want you to...

1558
01:48:30,380 --> 01:48:31,616
Merlin!

1559
01:48:47,398 --> 01:48:49,467
Merlin, what the fuck
have you done?

1560
01:48:49,500 --> 01:48:53,070
Our journey together
began many years ago...

1561
01:48:53,104 --> 01:48:55,741
when your father
did the same thing for us.

1562
01:48:55,773 --> 01:48:58,475
Our journey began
with a mistake I made.

1563
01:48:58,509 --> 01:49:00,579
Give me the can.
That's an order.

1564
01:49:01,045 --> 01:49:02,245
Can's empty.

1565
01:49:02,781 --> 01:49:04,549
Split second's over.

1566
01:49:04,582 --> 01:49:06,218
You two need to get going.

1567
01:49:06,250 --> 01:49:07,952
No, no, no. There's got
to be another way.

1568
01:49:07,982 --> 01:49:08,991
He's right.

1569
01:49:09,021 --> 01:49:10,522
Mission comes first.

1570
01:49:10,554 --> 01:49:11,889
Bollocks,
mission comes first!

1571
01:49:11,919 --> 01:49:12,993
Eggsy!

1572
01:49:13,023 --> 01:49:15,660
This is no time for emotion.
Remember your training.

1573
01:49:15,693 --> 01:49:17,129
Or we all die.

1574
01:49:19,430 --> 01:49:21,232
Now get on with it.

1575
01:49:21,264 --> 01:49:23,768
Do as you're told.
Move it!

1576
01:49:31,209 --> 01:49:32,409
Go.

1577
01:49:41,286 --> 01:49:42,486
It's been an honor.

1578
01:49:44,555 --> 01:49:45,756
Good luck.

1579
01:50:23,495 --> 01:50:25,330
<i>- Poppy, come in.
- Roger.</i>

1580
01:50:26,464 --> 01:50:27,664
Are you expecting
another lawyer?

1581
01:50:28,899 --> 01:50:30,500
There's
a guy here singing.

1582
01:50:32,269 --> 01:50:33,571
Singing?

1583
01:50:44,749 --> 01:50:46,585
<i>Bring him to me.</i>

1584
01:50:58,629 --> 01:51:00,631
Poppy,
we got a situation here.

1585
01:51:39,571 --> 01:51:41,839
He stepped on a land mine.

1586
01:51:41,872 --> 01:51:44,276
Can we get somebody out there
to clean that up?

1587
01:51:46,176 --> 01:51:47,545
Hello?

1588
01:52:03,862 --> 01:52:05,797
Crap. We're under attack.

1589
01:52:05,830 --> 01:52:07,798
Code five. Code five.

1590
01:52:07,828 --> 01:52:08,836
You two,
off your fuckin' asses.

1591
01:52:08,866 --> 01:52:11,101
Guard the door.

1592
01:52:11,134 --> 01:52:13,537
Sir Elton, stay here.
We're under attack.

1593
01:52:16,139 --> 01:52:18,375
- Is it a rescue attempt?
- Might be.

1594
01:52:19,376 --> 01:52:20,576
Yes!

1595
01:52:31,722 --> 01:52:32,990
Isn't that supposed
to be Saturday?

1596
01:52:33,023 --> 01:52:35,093
- What day is it today?
- Wednesday.

1597
01:52:35,125 --> 01:52:36,325
Exactly!

1598
01:53:17,033 --> 01:53:19,271
- Elton, just calm down.
- Fuck you!

1599
01:53:31,049 --> 01:53:32,350
Stay there, Elton.

1600
01:53:32,380 --> 01:53:33,488
Fuck off!

1601
01:53:33,518 --> 01:53:35,520
Or I'll fuck you up.

1602
01:54:10,420 --> 01:54:11,620
Fuck me.

1603
01:55:10,880 --> 01:55:13,218
Holy cow.
Get this out of here. Go!

1604
01:55:15,051 --> 01:55:16,254
Eggsy, get the case.

1605
01:55:21,091 --> 01:55:22,760
You are going to tell me...

1606
01:55:22,794 --> 01:55:24,327
what the access code is.

1607
01:56:54,919 --> 01:56:57,354
Come on, Jet. Good girl.

1608
01:57:02,926 --> 01:57:04,295
Motherfucker!

1609
01:57:36,760 --> 01:57:39,028
Get out of the way, Elton.

1610
01:57:39,063 --> 01:57:41,332
Stay down.
It's not allowed to hurt me.

1611
01:57:41,366 --> 01:57:42,566
Thank you.

1612
01:58:20,670 --> 01:58:21,870
<i>Fuck you, Poppy!</i>

1613
01:58:22,572 --> 01:58:23,874
<i>Fuck you, Poppy!</i>

1614
01:58:24,541 --> 01:58:26,544
Fuck you, Elton.

1615
01:58:27,946 --> 01:58:30,615
Kill Elton John.

1616
01:58:33,750 --> 01:58:34,950
Fuck!

1617
01:58:37,021 --> 01:58:38,723
Elton, take the ball.

1618
01:58:48,136 --> 01:58:49,336
Thank you.

1619
01:58:49,366 --> 01:58:51,768
Now, go off
and save the world.

1620
01:58:51,801 --> 01:58:53,604
If I save the world,
can I have two tickets

1621
01:58:53,634 --> 01:58:54,809
to your next concert?

1622
01:58:54,839 --> 01:58:56,807
Darling,
if you save the world,

1623
01:58:56,840 --> 01:58:58,643
you can have a backstage pass.

1624
01:59:06,917 --> 01:59:08,652
Fuck you.

1625
01:59:11,655 --> 01:59:12,956
Time's up.

1626
01:59:12,990 --> 01:59:14,259
Fuck!

1627
01:59:19,862 --> 01:59:21,062
Bennie, Bennie, Bennie!

1628
01:59:21,302 --> 01:59:22,502
Get them!

1629
01:59:22,532 --> 01:59:23,732
Got it.

1630
01:59:24,736 --> 01:59:26,104
Kill him, Bennie!

1631
01:59:26,137 --> 01:59:28,438
Here, heel! Heel! Good boy!

1632
01:59:28,472 --> 01:59:29,672
Come on!

1633
01:59:35,946 --> 01:59:37,180
Give me the code.

1634
01:59:37,214 --> 01:59:38,950
No. We're not done yet.

1635
01:59:45,022 --> 01:59:46,290
Lucky for you, Charlie...

1636
01:59:46,320 --> 01:59:47,394
one of us understands

1637
01:59:47,424 --> 01:59:48,925
what it means
to be a gentleman.

1638
01:59:54,465 --> 01:59:55,934
Let's make this fair.

1639
02:00:42,679 --> 02:00:43,947
Give me the code!

1640
02:00:43,981 --> 02:00:45,916
I can't.

1641
02:00:45,950 --> 02:00:47,718
Only Poppy knows it.

1642
02:00:47,750 --> 02:00:49,553
Well, then you're no use
to me, are you?

1643
02:00:50,158 --> 02:00:51,358
For the record, Charlie...

1644
02:00:51,388 --> 02:00:54,725
I'm more of a gentleman
than you'll ever be.

1645
02:00:54,759 --> 02:00:57,328
But right now, it's time
to drop the gentle bit.

1646
02:00:58,496 --> 02:00:59,964
This is for Kingsman.

1647
02:01:00,965 --> 02:01:02,567
For my mate Brandon.

1648
02:01:03,300 --> 02:01:05,134
For Roxy.

1649
02:01:05,167 --> 02:01:06,704
For JB.

1650
02:01:09,005 --> 02:01:10,575
And for Merlin.

1651
02:01:12,142 --> 02:01:13,844
Good night, bruv.

1652
02:01:40,269 --> 02:01:42,439
Hey, fellas.

1653
02:01:42,473 --> 02:01:44,041
You're going to
give us the code.

1654
02:01:46,009 --> 02:01:47,278
Or what?

1655
02:01:47,312 --> 02:01:49,514
'Cause you don't seem like
the kind of gentleman

1656
02:01:49,546 --> 02:01:52,049
who would hurt a lady.

1657
02:01:54,884 --> 02:01:57,687
Perhaps not.
Call me old-fashioned...

1658
02:01:57,720 --> 02:02:00,122
I don't consider genocide
especially ladylike.

1659
02:02:00,157 --> 02:02:02,894
Right. Enough small talk.

1660
02:02:05,066 --> 02:02:06,266
Give us the code.

1661
02:02:06,296 --> 02:02:07,564
Sure.

1662
02:02:07,598 --> 02:02:09,901
No. I don't think so.

1663
02:02:19,942 --> 02:02:21,544
Heroin.

1664
02:02:21,577 --> 02:02:22,946
You know, where I come from...

1665
02:02:22,979 --> 02:02:25,049
this shit you've been peddling's
ruined a lot of lives.

1666
02:02:26,215 --> 02:02:28,352
But yours is even more deadly.

1667
02:02:28,384 --> 02:02:30,454
But it feels so nice,
it's gonna make you

1668
02:02:30,487 --> 02:02:32,289
lower your guard.

1669
02:02:32,322 --> 02:02:35,826
Our colleague, Merlin,
may he rest in peace...

1670
02:02:35,858 --> 02:02:38,361
managed to synthesize your
horrible little formula...

1671
02:02:38,396 --> 02:02:39,697
and speed up its effects.

1672
02:02:39,731 --> 02:02:42,733
So I would say you have
just under eight minutes...

1673
02:02:42,767 --> 02:02:45,569
before paralysis sets in
and your breathing stops.

1674
02:02:45,603 --> 02:02:48,305
But, of course,
you know all about that.

1675
02:02:48,339 --> 02:02:51,341
So here's the deal. You release
the antidote worldwide,

1676
02:02:51,375 --> 02:02:53,176
and we make sure
you get a dose.

1677
02:02:53,210 --> 02:02:55,311
I have to give you
the code to live?

1678
02:02:55,345 --> 02:02:58,582
Honey, you're so smart.
You should work for me.

1679
02:02:58,616 --> 02:03:01,185
Right. Give us the code.

1680
02:03:01,219 --> 02:03:05,189
Why not? The decree's getting
signed soon...

1681
02:03:05,223 --> 02:03:06,890
anyhoo.

1682
02:03:07,523 --> 02:03:09,893
It's "Viva las vegan."

1683
02:03:10,995 --> 02:03:12,195
Get it?

1684
02:03:12,764 --> 02:03:15,232
"Viva las..."

1685
02:03:17,634 --> 02:03:19,704
Come snuggle with me.

1686
02:03:20,504 --> 02:03:22,573
I like you.

1687
02:03:24,575 --> 02:03:26,778
I don't think
that's terribly likely.

1688
02:03:49,037 --> 02:03:50,237
She's OD'd.

1689
02:03:50,267 --> 02:03:51,736
You gave her too much.

1690
02:03:51,768 --> 02:03:53,303
Did I?

1691
02:03:53,336 --> 02:03:55,939
You know, I really don't have as much
experience with all this drug stuff...

1692
02:03:55,973 --> 02:03:57,173
as people think.

1693
02:03:57,640 --> 02:03:58,975
Better be the right code.

1694
02:04:02,813 --> 02:04:06,282
"Viva las..."

1695
02:04:06,317 --> 02:04:07,618
So?

1696
02:04:11,188 --> 02:04:12,523
Don't move, kid.

1697
02:04:12,555 --> 02:04:13,758
You try anything funny,

1698
02:04:13,791 --> 02:04:14,992
and I'll turn
this thing electric.

1699
02:04:16,593 --> 02:04:19,229
Now give up your guns,
fellas. Slide 'em over.

1700
02:04:24,640 --> 02:04:25,840
Whiskey.

1701
02:04:25,870 --> 02:04:27,738
We are all
on the same side here.

1702
02:04:27,768 --> 02:04:28,876
You've had a head injury.

1703
02:04:28,906 --> 02:04:30,674
The exact same thing
happened to Harry.

1704
02:04:30,707 --> 02:04:33,176
You're havin' some
sort of brain glitch.

1705
02:04:33,210 --> 02:04:36,080
Nope. My brain's
all good, kid.

1706
02:04:36,612 --> 02:04:38,048
And you know what?

1707
02:04:38,081 --> 02:04:41,852
I reckon the same was true for
your friend Harry over here.

1708
02:04:41,884 --> 02:04:44,887
Real fine instincts,
I'll give him that.

1709
02:04:44,921 --> 02:04:46,322
So stay still...

1710
02:04:46,352 --> 02:04:47,461
or I'll dice him up so small,

1711
02:04:47,491 --> 02:04:48,595
you can take him
home in a bucket...

1712
02:04:48,625 --> 02:04:49,993
and still have room
for what's left

1713
02:04:50,027 --> 02:04:51,562
of your buddy, Merlin.

1714
02:04:52,597 --> 02:04:54,264
Well, that's just
fucking great.

1715
02:04:54,298 --> 02:04:55,866
You're working
for the president?

1716
02:04:55,899 --> 02:04:57,134
That asshole?

1717
02:04:58,268 --> 02:05:02,406
Hell no. It's a matter
of personal principle, agent.

1718
02:05:02,438 --> 02:05:04,941
No more drug users.

1719
02:05:04,974 --> 02:05:08,044
And the Statesman
share price rockets.

1720
02:05:09,513 --> 02:05:12,816
So those are your principles?
Making money?

1721
02:05:12,849 --> 02:05:15,152
Our agencies were
founded to uphold peace.

1722
02:05:15,184 --> 02:05:16,387
To protect the innocent.

1723
02:05:16,420 --> 02:05:18,488
Do you wanna know
who was innocent?

1724
02:05:18,522 --> 02:05:21,526
My high school sweetheart.

1725
02:05:21,992 --> 02:05:23,827
Love of my life.

1726
02:05:23,861 --> 02:05:25,763
Pregnant with my little boy.

1727
02:05:26,662 --> 02:05:28,633
He'd be about your age now...

1728
02:05:28,666 --> 02:05:30,634
if his mama hadn't got caught
in the crossfire...

1729
02:05:30,664 --> 02:05:31,771
when two meth head freaks

1730
02:05:31,801 --> 02:05:34,839
decided to rob
a fucking convenience store.

1731
02:05:37,375 --> 02:05:40,544
A world without
those people in it...

1732
02:05:40,576 --> 02:05:43,046
sure smells like peace to me.

1733
02:05:43,813 --> 02:05:45,982
<i>You break the law...</i>

1734
02:05:46,017 --> 02:05:47,885
<i>you pay the price.</i>

1735
02:05:48,551 --> 02:05:50,586
<i>Good riddance...</i>

1736
02:05:50,620 --> 02:05:52,890
<i>to all of them.</i>

1737
02:05:57,627 --> 02:06:00,897
That's why I got
to destroy that case.

1738
02:06:00,930 --> 02:06:04,634
Now slide it over,
Agent Galahad.

1739
02:06:09,505 --> 02:06:11,107
Thank you.

1740
02:06:11,140 --> 02:06:13,109
Do you know what, Harry?

1741
02:06:13,143 --> 02:06:14,343
I think he's got a point.

1742
02:06:16,847 --> 02:06:20,151
I think it sounds
like a bright idea.

1743
02:08:36,887 --> 02:08:40,957
Put alpha gel on that,
dickhead.

1744
02:08:50,866 --> 02:08:52,469
"Viva las vegan."

1745
02:08:54,670 --> 02:08:55,972
This one's for you, Merlin.

1746
02:09:10,492 --> 02:09:11,692
<i>It's a day
of worldwide celebration</i>

1747
02:09:11,722 --> 02:09:14,124
<i>as millions rejoice...</i>

1748
02:09:14,157 --> 02:09:17,528
<i>after they or their loved ones
were saved from death.</i>

1749
02:09:29,439 --> 02:09:32,108
<i>Distribution of The Golden
Circle antidote continues...</i>

1750
02:09:32,142 --> 02:09:34,044
<i>and field hospitals
are emptying...</i>

1751
02:09:34,077 --> 02:09:37,414
<i>as victims return
to their homes tonight, cured.</i>

1752
02:09:58,667 --> 02:10:00,903
Come on, Liam. Man, come on.

1753
02:10:00,938 --> 02:10:03,407
Yes! Yes! Yes!

1754
02:10:09,012 --> 02:10:10,648
- I love you, man!
- I love you!

1755
02:10:10,680 --> 02:10:12,916
I'm never touching
that shit again!

1756
02:10:16,219 --> 02:10:17,419
What happened?

1757
02:10:18,755 --> 02:10:20,991
- Did I miss something?
- You sure did.

1758
02:10:21,023 --> 02:10:25,128
From now on, Tequila,
I suggest you stick to booze.

1759
02:10:27,764 --> 02:10:29,333
<i>The president
actively sanctioned</i>

1760
02:10:29,366 --> 02:10:32,603
<i>the deaths of hundreds
of millions of people...</i>

1761
02:10:33,469 --> 02:10:35,972
<i>and lied to the public.</i>

1762
02:10:36,005 --> 02:10:39,175
<i>I am proud to be responsible
for his impeachment...</i>

1763
02:10:39,209 --> 02:10:41,010
<i>and I will do everything I can</i>

1764
02:10:41,044 --> 02:10:43,514
<i>to ensure a smooth
transition of power.</i>

1765
02:10:44,514 --> 02:10:47,384
In honor
of this historic occasion,

1766
02:10:47,417 --> 02:10:48,853
we have purchased...

1767
02:10:49,887 --> 02:10:52,223
a distillery in Scotland.

1768
02:10:53,328 --> 02:10:54,528
This shows the world...

1769
02:10:54,558 --> 02:10:59,430
that Kingsman is now
joining the liquor business.

1770
02:11:00,063 --> 02:11:02,399
Before we were cousins.

1771
02:11:02,432 --> 02:11:06,836
Now we're brothers,
working side-by-side.

1772
02:11:06,870 --> 02:11:10,006
All our resources
are now yours.

1773
02:11:10,040 --> 02:11:12,276
You can rebuild.

1774
02:11:12,308 --> 02:11:14,243
Yeah, y'all shittin'
in high cotton now.

1775
02:11:15,444 --> 02:11:17,814
Agent Tequila,
this is a formal occasion...

1776
02:11:17,848 --> 02:11:19,649
where's your tie and jacket?

1777
02:11:19,679 --> 02:11:20,820
Sorry, sir.

1778
02:11:20,850 --> 02:11:24,588
Maybe the Kingsman boys
can dress you properly.

1779
02:11:25,688 --> 02:11:27,258
To our union!

1780
02:11:28,325 --> 02:11:29,525
To our union!

1781
02:11:33,162 --> 02:11:35,165
Final order of business...

1782
02:11:35,965 --> 02:11:37,399
we would be honored

1783
02:11:37,433 --> 02:11:40,970
if one of you would be
our new Agent Whiskey.

1784
02:11:41,005 --> 02:11:45,876
Yeah, this two Galahad thing
is just fucking confusing.

1785
02:11:47,076 --> 02:11:48,512
Well, I'm very honored...

1786
02:11:50,813 --> 02:11:52,015
Champ...

1787
02:11:53,817 --> 02:11:56,020
I'd like to throw
my hat in the ring.

1788
02:12:00,290 --> 02:12:01,490
All right!

1789
02:12:02,593 --> 02:12:03,928
Statesmen, the vote.

1790
02:12:06,929 --> 02:12:08,898
Looks like she's in.

1791
02:12:08,932 --> 02:12:10,233
Have a seat.

1792
02:12:14,771 --> 02:12:16,539
To Agent Whiskey!

1793
02:12:16,572 --> 02:12:17,772
Agent Whiskey!

1794
02:12:25,314 --> 02:12:26,514
Cheers!

1795
02:12:31,220 --> 02:12:33,624
Are you sure
I don't look like a dick?

1796
02:12:36,526 --> 02:12:37,726
Look in the mirror.

1797
02:12:43,633 --> 02:12:45,001
What do you see?

1798
02:12:45,035 --> 02:12:48,537
Someone who can't believe
what the fuck is going on.

1799
02:12:49,840 --> 02:12:51,575
I see a man
who is honorable...

1800
02:12:53,776 --> 02:12:55,045
brave...

1801
02:12:55,745 --> 02:12:57,414
loyal...

1802
02:12:57,447 --> 02:12:59,717
who's fulfilled
his huge potential.

1803
02:13:01,384 --> 02:13:03,754
A man who's done
something good with his life.

1804
02:13:05,054 --> 02:13:07,290
I owe you everything, Harry.

1805
02:13:08,558 --> 02:13:09,960
Thank you.

1806
02:13:09,992 --> 02:13:11,294
Don't mention it.

1807
02:13:12,562 --> 02:13:13,762
You ready?

1808
02:13:16,532 --> 02:13:18,468
Not a doubt in my mind.

1809
02:14:10,153 --> 02:14:13,055
<i>As one of our
founding Kingsman once said...</i>

1810
02:14:13,089 --> 02:14:15,058
<i>this is not the end.</i>

1811
02:14:15,091 --> 02:14:18,228
<i>It is not even the beginning
of the end.</i>

1812
02:14:18,260 --> 02:14:22,732
<i>But it is, perhaps,
the end of the beginning.</i>

1813
02:14:23,500 --> 02:14:24,768
Yeah!

1814
02:14:27,798 --> 02:14:34,798
_

1815
