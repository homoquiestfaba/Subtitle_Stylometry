00:03:23,036 --> 00:03:24,503
I'm gonna rip your head off!

2
00:03:24,904 --> 00:03:26,269
Donnie...

3
00:03:26,606 --> 00:03:28,301
...you're not in Vietnam.

4
00:03:28,508 --> 00:03:30,476
Man, you scared the shit out of me.

5
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:34,973
Yeah, take my board. Yeah.

6
00:03:36,516 --> 00:03:39,485
-Hey, Mom.
-Hi, baby.

7
00:03:57,070 --> 00:03:58,503
Hey!

8
00:04:14,821 --> 00:04:16,220
Morning.

9
00:04:17,357 --> 00:04:19,154
You're going to school today,
right, Tony?

10
00:04:19,359 --> 00:04:22,886
Don't worry about it, Dad.
l'm just gonna get wet.

11
00:04:23,096 --> 00:04:25,826
l don't want my son
to be a ditchdigger.

12
00:04:29,736 --> 00:04:30,998
l got him, Dad, okay?

13
00:04:32,405 --> 00:04:35,704
Don't ever go outside
dressed like that again.

14
00:04:45,752 --> 00:04:48,186
One, two, three.

15
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,580
Yeah!

16
00:05:46,045 --> 00:05:48,639
-lt's big today.
-They're there, huh?

17
00:05:48,848 --> 00:05:50,543
That's Skip charging.

18
00:05:59,225 --> 00:06:00,783
Shit, dude.

19
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:07,732
lt's judgment day, boys.
Let's paddle.

20
00:06:07,934 --> 00:06:09,367
You broads aren't surfing now.

21
00:06:09,569 --> 00:06:11,093
l ain't surfing no sloppy seconds.

22
00:06:11,304 --> 00:06:13,966
You're working rat patrol, mop top.

23
00:06:15,041 --> 00:06:19,068
Jay, you're on parking-lot detail.
Keep it local.

24
00:06:20,246 --> 00:06:22,476
And you, Peralta, the boneyard.

25
00:06:22,682 --> 00:06:24,445
l don't want our boards
hitting a piling.

26
00:06:24,650 --> 00:06:27,084
l better not see any dings.

27
00:06:27,286 --> 00:06:29,811
lf you wanna surf the cove,
you gotta earn it.

28
00:06:41,801 --> 00:06:43,962
Look at that right.

29
00:07:01,587 --> 00:07:02,849

30
00:07:03,756 --> 00:07:05,553
Hey, here.

31
00:07:07,927 --> 00:07:09,690
Hey, you should get out, man.

32
00:07:17,336 --> 00:07:20,032
Let's go, brother. Get out there.

33
00:07:33,586 --> 00:07:34,883
Vals!

34
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,351
What the fuck?

35
00:07:41,761 --> 00:07:43,058
Go back to the Valley, kooks!

36
00:07:49,535 --> 00:07:51,867
Are you guys lost or what?

37
00:07:52,071 --> 00:07:53,538
-This is private.
-You're not the law.

38
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:55,468
Go back to the Valley, you kooks!

39
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:57,404
-No Vals.
-Get out of here, man.

40
00:07:57,610 --> 00:07:59,805
-No.
-Locals only.

41
00:08:00,012 --> 00:08:03,106
You guys have, like, a blue, like,
'67 Chevy Camaro?

42
00:08:03,316 --> 00:08:05,079
Yeah, maybe.

43
00:08:06,052 --> 00:08:08,213
-Hey! My carburetor!
-Get the fuck out, kook.

44
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:09,752
-Thattaboy, Jay boy.
-Hey. Hey!

45
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:11,446
-Valley bitch.
-Leave now.

46
00:08:14,760 --> 00:08:16,785
-Yeah, Tony!
-Help me out here.

47
00:08:16,996 --> 00:08:19,760
Fucking anal pirate fags!

48
00:08:21,634 --> 00:08:22,965
Go back, faggot!

49
00:08:24,136 --> 00:08:25,330
Hey, grab my board!

50
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,438
Thanks a lot, pal.

51
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:37,441
Now, get out there and surf,
you little grommets.

52
00:08:37,650 --> 00:08:39,379
Don't screw up.

53
00:08:43,022 --> 00:08:45,855
Yeah, and then she had
a big old head.

54
00:08:46,325 --> 00:08:48,452
Chino, let me toke on that.

55
00:08:48,661 --> 00:08:50,788
You got one in your hair, bro.

56
00:08:50,997 --> 00:08:53,056
Yeah, it's my backup joint.

57
00:08:55,968 --> 00:08:57,162
He's gonna go under.

58
00:08:58,170 --> 00:09:01,162
-Hey, there goes Tony.
-Little wetback.

59
00:09:03,709 --> 00:09:06,371
Yeah. That was a good one.

60
00:09:06,979 --> 00:09:08,537
Hey, here comes Jay.

61
00:09:23,963 --> 00:09:25,453
There goes Stacy.
There goes Stacy.

62
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,469
Wipeout!

63
00:09:34,674 --> 00:09:35,868
Milk and cookies.

64
00:09:36,075 --> 00:09:37,599
Hey.

65
00:09:40,446 --> 00:09:42,539
Oh, my God.

66
00:09:43,316 --> 00:09:45,250
Back to the boneyard for you, pal.

67
00:09:47,887 --> 00:09:49,286
Come on.

68
00:10:07,873 --> 00:10:10,569
-Perfect timing.
-Ahoy.

69
00:10:10,943 --> 00:10:12,638
Yeah, put your
sweeping hat on, man.

70
00:10:15,715 --> 00:10:19,207
l'll say it, man. This shop's a shithole.
Come on. Get to work, huh?

71
00:10:24,657 --> 00:10:27,091
Surf's up, man! Yeah!

72
00:10:28,594 --> 00:10:31,791
l'm sorry, man. ls your equilibrium
shit messing with you again?

73
00:10:31,998 --> 00:10:36,298
Come on. That's not right.
We know he's got bad ears. Come on.

74
00:10:36,502 --> 00:10:38,129
Sid!

75
00:10:41,907 --> 00:10:43,101
That-- That was good.

76
00:10:43,309 --> 00:10:45,334
-Oh, man, l'm sorry, Sid.
-That was a good one.

77
00:10:45,544 --> 00:10:46,841
lt's cool, man.

78
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:51,005
Hey, why do l pay you when l should
have you arrested for loitering?

79
00:10:51,417 --> 00:10:54,716
-You don't pay me.
-Well, now you know why, Sid.

80
00:10:54,920 --> 00:10:56,046
Where are your pals, man?

81
00:10:58,124 --> 00:10:59,785
Yeah.

82
00:11:34,193 --> 00:11:35,387
Hey!

83
00:11:41,033 --> 00:11:42,796
You got my stuff?

84
00:11:43,002 --> 00:11:44,526
Yeah. Hi.

85
00:11:45,204 --> 00:11:46,603
-Yeah.
-Hi.

86
00:11:46,806 --> 00:11:48,501
This isn't a library...

87
00:11:48,708 --> 00:11:52,371
...so it's 1 0 bucks to browse.
You got 1 0 bucks?

88
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:58,316
Didn't bring any money today.

89
00:11:58,517 --> 00:12:01,247
Yeah, well, why'd you come into
my store, then, asshole?

90
00:12:02,021 --> 00:12:03,454
Hey.

91
00:12:05,324 --> 00:12:07,349
Go browse in the Valley, kook.

92
00:12:08,060 --> 00:12:10,392
Okay, so, what?
You got cash, or...? What?

93
00:12:10,596 --> 00:12:13,622
Man, l got something
better than cash.

94
00:12:14,867 --> 00:12:17,734
These are urethane
skateboard wheels.

95
00:12:17,937 --> 00:12:19,802
They're ure-what?

96
00:12:20,973 --> 00:12:22,634
Urethane, man. lt comes from oil.

97
00:12:22,842 --> 00:12:24,366
-From oil?
-Yep.

98
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,569
With these, you can do the same
hard turns you do on your surfboard.

99
00:12:27,780 --> 00:12:28,804
-Yeah?
-Yep.

100
00:12:29,014 --> 00:12:31,380
You can even climb walls, man,
because they grip.

101
00:12:31,584 --> 00:12:32,608
-They grip?
-They grip?

102
00:12:32,818 --> 00:12:34,410
-They grip.
-Shit.

103
00:12:38,924 --> 00:12:42,087
-Sid. Sid, you should've seen us.
-Check these out.

104
00:12:43,796 --> 00:12:45,764
They're urethane.
They come from oil.

105
00:12:45,965 --> 00:12:47,455
And they grip.

106
00:13:01,647 --> 00:13:03,342
Who's got bad karma?

107
00:13:06,152 --> 00:13:08,120
l said, who's got bad karma?

108
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:11,016
-l got the worst karma, Skip.
-Dude, right here, Skip.

109
00:13:11,223 --> 00:13:13,748
-Oh, no, no.
-Give it to me, me.

110
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:15,950
-l'm first. Come on.
-lt's my board.

111
00:13:16,162 --> 00:13:18,062
Come on, you little pervert.

112
00:13:27,506 --> 00:13:29,030
Oh, my God.

113
00:13:36,348 --> 00:13:37,542
-Nice.
-Ripping, dude.

114
00:13:37,750 --> 00:13:40,378
-ls that all right or what?
-lnsane. lnsane.

115
00:13:40,586 --> 00:13:42,281
Red Dog, hit it.

116
00:13:43,722 --> 00:13:45,781
Yeah, surf it like a wave, man.

117
00:13:46,192 --> 00:13:47,386
Yeah, Red Dog.

118
00:13:47,593 --> 00:13:49,458
-Hey, Kathy.
-Hi, Kath.

119
00:13:49,662 --> 00:13:51,289
Hey, get back here.

120
00:13:51,497 --> 00:13:54,022
Hey, dude, is that your sister?

121
00:13:54,934 --> 00:13:56,595
l grew up, Stacy.

122
00:13:56,802 --> 00:13:58,770
No shit.

123
00:14:04,844 --> 00:14:07,210
-Yeah, Jay.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

124
00:14:07,413 --> 00:14:09,005
-Jay boy.
-Come on, Jay.

125
00:14:11,250 --> 00:14:12,740
-Yeah!
-Jay boy!

126
00:14:15,321 --> 00:14:17,016
Oh, my God.

127
00:14:17,223 --> 00:14:19,657
-Yeah.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

128
00:14:22,394 --> 00:14:23,986
Pull my ankles. No, pull my ankles.

129
00:14:24,196 --> 00:14:26,187
Come on, Stacy.

130
00:14:26,966 --> 00:14:29,025
Yeah, Stace.

131
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,528
l can't help it. l love long hair.

132
00:14:35,608 --> 00:14:37,200
-Come on.
-Later.

133
00:14:37,409 --> 00:14:39,274
That was gnarly.

134
00:14:40,546 --> 00:14:43,640
Go-- Go slow. Go slow.
Oh, no. Are you okay?

135
00:14:43,849 --> 00:14:45,316
Yeah.

136
00:14:45,751 --> 00:14:47,275
Should my weight
be on my back foot?

137
00:14:47,486 --> 00:14:50,478
Well, yeah, l mean, that's--
That's how l do it. l mean...

138
00:14:50,689 --> 00:14:52,247
...it might be different, though...

139
00:14:52,458 --> 00:14:54,983
...the whole center-of-gravity thing,
you know, for girls.

140
00:14:55,194 --> 00:14:58,129
-Yeah.
-You know, your back--

141
00:15:00,799 --> 00:15:02,494
Tony.

142
00:15:14,280 --> 00:15:15,770
Tony!

143
00:15:15,981 --> 00:15:18,006
Oh, yeah. Bring it in.

144
00:15:22,521 --> 00:15:24,318
Yeah!

00:15:25,190 --> 00:15:26,589
Yeah. ls that all right or what?

146
00:15:27,459 --> 00:15:28,653
Yeah.

147
00:15:28,861 --> 00:15:31,261
Fingers together, T.A. Chop, chop.

148
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:37,268
-Tony.
-Exactly.

149
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:41,336
Safe.

150
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:46,669
Stacy, you're gonna need more speed
than that if you wanna pull it off, right?

151
00:15:46,879 --> 00:15:49,439
That's right. Listen to the master.

152
00:15:49,949 --> 00:15:52,417
Grab your pad
and take notes, Peralta.

153
00:15:53,852 --> 00:15:56,150
Yeah, Tony.

154
00:15:56,355 --> 00:15:58,983
Yeah, nice, T.A. Nice.

155
00:16:00,192 --> 00:16:03,684
-Yeah, nice, Jay.
-Yeah, Jay boy.

156
00:16:03,896 --> 00:16:08,196
Hey, Billy, man, if we built a decent
skateboard, we would rake it in, man.

157
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:11,130
l don't make toys, bro. l'm a shaper.

158
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:14,465
Hey, l-- l think we should
start a skateboard team, man.

159
00:16:14,673 --> 00:16:16,607
Sid. Out of here, man. Come on.

160
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:20,210
Thank you. You little maggot. Scat.

161
00:16:20,412 --> 00:16:22,437
Beat it, Sid.

162
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:24,479
So, what do you think, man?

163
00:16:24,683 --> 00:16:29,313
Well, there's more concrete in
the world than good surf breaks.

164
00:16:29,521 --> 00:16:32,649
Yeah, l hear that, man.
There's money in this.

165
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:37,986
There's only beer.

166
00:16:45,804 --> 00:16:50,036
l mean, how many 1 6-year-old
surfers wear watches, man?

167
00:16:50,576 --> 00:16:53,477
-lncoming!
-Yeah, and where's he going?

168
00:16:53,679 --> 00:16:55,271
Yeah, well...

169
00:16:56,015 --> 00:16:57,778
...he's got a job.

170
00:16:58,617 --> 00:17:00,517
Yeah, my point exactly.

171
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:03,119
He's not one of us, man.

172
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:06,785
-You know, he's not a pirate.
-Going to work, Peralta?

173
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:08,482
Yeah, get a haircut, man.

174
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:13,995
You dropped your cigarette.

175
00:17:14,199 --> 00:17:17,726
Give me the doobie, Sid.
Come on, you fucking homo.

176
00:17:20,539 --> 00:17:22,530
Get the fuck out of the way.

177
00:17:25,544 --> 00:17:28,741
You cut the check. Thanks.

178
00:17:36,121 --> 00:17:39,181
Oh, man. l'm still short.

179
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,916
You got any cash, J.B.?

180
00:17:45,764 --> 00:17:47,561
Yeah, right here.

181
00:17:49,001 --> 00:17:51,595
-l can't do that.
-No, no, no. Mom, check it out.

182
00:17:51,804 --> 00:17:53,829
lt's got Sid's name on it.

183
00:17:57,976 --> 00:17:59,841
l love you boys.

184
00:18:01,146 --> 00:18:04,673
Mom, Skip is putting together
a skate team.

185
00:18:05,350 --> 00:18:07,045
Far out.

186
00:18:07,252 --> 00:18:09,846
Hey, so who do you think
they're gonna put on the team?

187
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:11,886
Hopefully all of us.

188
00:18:29,374 --> 00:18:31,205
-Come on.
-Shut up.

189
00:18:32,778 --> 00:18:36,976
Hey, listen, when you're riding for one
of these shops around town-- Yeah?

190
00:18:37,182 --> 00:18:38,513
You mean a little faggot shop?

191
00:18:38,717 --> 00:18:40,446
--you can have off days.

192
00:18:40,652 --> 00:18:43,519
You have an off day riding
for this shop, it's treason.

193
00:18:43,722 --> 00:18:47,783
Yeah, you got to approach every day
like it's your last. All right?

194
00:18:47,993 --> 00:18:50,188
-Yep.
-Anyone got a problem with that?

195
00:18:50,395 --> 00:18:52,863
-Nope.
-No.

196
00:18:53,065 --> 00:18:55,033
-Stecyk?
-Peggy.

197
00:18:55,234 --> 00:18:56,997
-Oh, no way.
-Take off your shirt, Peggy.

198
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:58,726
-Wentzle.
-See them Tater Tots.

199
00:18:58,937 --> 00:19:00,370
-Jay.
-Shut up.

200
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:01,766
-Biniak.
-Let me see.

201
00:19:01,974 --> 00:19:04,408
-Yes.
-Shogo.

202
00:19:04,610 --> 00:19:08,307
T.A. Red Dog. Baby Sid.

Wear them with pride, man.

204
00:19:11,316 --> 00:19:14,217
Yeah, wear them with pride, man.

205
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:17,820
Or we'll rip them off your bony backs,
you understand?

206
00:19:18,657 --> 00:19:20,056
-Yeah.
-That's insane.

207
00:19:20,259 --> 00:19:21,487
Okay.

208
00:19:21,693 --> 00:19:24,821
Now, has everyone seen this?

209
00:19:25,697 --> 00:19:27,665
-Skateboard competition.
-You can't even read.

210
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:29,663
You have one month to prepare.

211
00:19:29,868 --> 00:19:33,099
And we're gonna have training
starting at 4 every day, all right?

212
00:19:33,305 --> 00:19:35,102
We gotta get serious here.
We have to...

213
00:19:35,307 --> 00:19:38,208
...because there are gonna be
hundreds of skaters from all over...

214
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,310
...and we need to shut them down.

215
00:19:40,512 --> 00:19:42,002
Yeah!

216
00:19:43,315 --> 00:19:46,773

-Thanks, Skip.
-Let's go.

222
00:20:03,735 --> 00:20:07,102
Hey, Skip,

223
00:20:11,310 --> 00:20:13,244

00:20:13,445 --> 00:20:15,310
All right. Let's go.

225
00:20:15,847 --> 00:20:18,816
Hey, l'm not bailing

226
00:20:19,017 --> 00:20:20,678
Oh, shit. Get the gate. Get the gate.

-Close the door. Come on. Quick.

228
00:20:24,957 --> 00:20:26,686
-Get back here!
-Come on.

229
00:20:26,892 --> 00:20:30,020
lt was supposed to keep them
out of trouble, man.

230
00:20:30,229 --> 00:20:31,856
Let us in!

231
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:34,498
Get back here! Hey!

232
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,308
Speed wobble!

233
00:20:58,857 --> 00:21:01,382
-Asshole.
-Dude, he's got the inner-ear problem.

234
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,320
Suck my inner ear, Jay boy.
Fucking dick!

235
00:21:22,948 --> 00:21:24,745
Hey. Move!

236
00:21:25,350 --> 00:21:27,011
Hey, Donnie.

00:21:44,636 --> 00:21:47,161
-Hey, what's up, guys?
-What's up, Mark?

238
00:21:48,140 --> 00:21:49,767
Hey.

239
00:21:49,975 --> 00:21:51,943
Hey, Philaine.

240
00:21:53,245 --> 00:21:55,907
You guys look bad as shit.

241
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:57,843
Look at you.

242
00:21:58,050 --> 00:21:59,711
You get off me, lady.

243
00:22:02,087 --> 00:22:04,282
Bitchen, huh? Hey.

244
00:22:07,292 --> 00:22:08,554
-You hungry?
-Yeah.

245
00:22:08,760 --> 00:22:11,320
-l got tamales in the kitchen.
-Come on, guys. Let's go.

246
00:22:11,530 --> 00:22:14,499
-l'm starving.
-What's going on?

247
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,781
She's-- She's crazy, Jay.

248
00:22:41,593 --> 00:22:44,528
That's why you love her, right?

249
00:22:47,366 --> 00:22:51,029
Mark, can you--? Yeah, just grab
a load and give us a minute.

250
00:22:52,871 --> 00:22:54,338
Thanks.

251
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:57,231
Hey, man, cover that shit up,
you know.

252
00:22:57,442 --> 00:22:59,808
Yeah. Sorry about that.

253
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:02,844
Like, what? Was he kidding?

254
00:23:06,218 --> 00:23:09,187
You look good. You know?

255
00:23:11,356 --> 00:23:12,618
Come on. Let me see the back.

256
00:23:16,294 --> 00:23:19,388
l like it. You look good.

257
00:23:21,633 --> 00:23:25,660
You'll always be my boy, you know.
Don't worry about that.

258
00:23:31,009 --> 00:23:33,307
Dude, l want you to have this.

259
00:23:40,585 --> 00:23:42,018
Come on, Jay.

260
00:24:16,688 --> 00:24:18,178
Jay!

261
00:25:07,138 --> 00:25:11,234
You learned that trick from me.
Watch this. l've been practicing.

262
00:25:11,443 --> 00:25:12,740
-Hey.
-What's up, Jay?

263
00:25:12,944 --> 00:25:14,434
Hey.

264
00:25:17,549 --> 00:25:19,983
lt's not looking so good, man.

265
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:24,121
No, dude. There's an occasional set.
lt's really not that bad.

266
00:25:27,459 --> 00:25:32,658
We were up at the Zephyr shop
yesterday with Skip and everybody...

267
00:25:32,864 --> 00:25:34,593
...when you were at work.

268
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,162
And....

269
00:25:38,770 --> 00:25:41,762
So Tony got on the team, right?

270
00:25:41,973 --> 00:25:47,673
And Sid and Peggy and Biniak
and Red Dog and Shogo.

271
00:25:50,015 --> 00:25:51,778
What about you?

272
00:25:53,151 --> 00:25:54,914
Yeah, l got on.

273
00:25:58,557 --> 00:26:00,218
Sorry, man.

274
00:26:00,759 --> 00:26:02,158
lt's all right.

275
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,225
Hey, what's that?

276
00:26:28,086 --> 00:26:31,021
With no end to the drought in sight,
authorities have announced...

277
00:26:31,222 --> 00:26:33,247
...emergency measures
for water rationing...

278
00:26:33,458 --> 00:26:35,289
-...that may force homeowners...
-Hey, Dad.

279
00:26:35,493 --> 00:26:37,427
-...to keep lawns and pools dry.
-Hey, boy.

280
00:26:37,629 --> 00:26:39,358
The Action 8 News Team
will explain--

281
00:26:39,564 --> 00:26:42,897
Hey, they told us to conserve water.

282
00:26:43,101 --> 00:26:44,966
We'll take you to the
drought conference--

283
00:26:45,170 --> 00:26:48,230
-So how were the waves?
-Don't even ask.

284
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,134
Yeah.

285
00:27:07,492 --> 00:27:09,050
Son of a bitch!

286
00:27:23,074 --> 00:27:24,735
We're here.

287
00:27:25,043 --> 00:27:27,136
Hey, hey, wait, wait, wait.
Come on. Hey.

288
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:28,812
Wait, now. Wait.

289
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,810
Hey, one at a time.
One at a time, all right?

290
00:27:33,018 --> 00:27:36,579
Hey, T.A., get inside
their heads, okay? Yeah?

291
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:40,887
Yeah, sorry. Yeah,
sorry about that. Sorry. Yeah.

292
00:27:41,092 --> 00:27:42,821
lt's an emergency. Yeah, hi.

293
00:27:43,028 --> 00:27:47,158
Oh, nice socks, man.
Nice socks. Nice socks.

294
00:27:47,999 --> 00:27:52,368
Yeah, this is Skip Engblom
and the Zephyr Skateboard Team.

295
00:27:52,570 --> 00:27:55,801
Here's our entry fees.
Now, where's our trophies?

296
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:59,338
Excuse me.
Go to the end of the line.

297
00:27:59,544 --> 00:28:03,071
Yeah, l thought this was
the end of the line, man. ls it not?

298
00:28:03,281 --> 00:28:06,546
-Go to the end of the line.
-Hey, man, listen. l'm--

299
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:08,651
-Yeah.
-Yeah? l'm sure we could...

300
00:28:08,853 --> 00:28:10,548
-...work something out here.
-Yeah.

301
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:13,849
-ls that good?
-Put your money out there.

302
00:28:14,259 --> 00:28:17,387
All right. You and your boys are okay.
All right, have a good day.

303
00:28:17,595 --> 00:28:20,120
-You right there are okay.
-Hey, you have a nice day, man.

304
00:28:20,331 --> 00:28:23,198
-Have a nice day.
-You're next now. Step up.

305
00:28:25,437 --> 00:28:26,836
Son of a bitch.

306
00:28:30,475 --> 00:28:32,238
Where's the course?

307
00:28:35,380 --> 00:28:37,211
There's a nice L-Sit
by Russ Howell.

308
00:28:37,415 --> 00:28:39,781
He's gonna press up now
into a handstand...

309
00:28:39,984 --> 00:28:42,452
-...and back down on his board.
-ldiot.

310
00:28:42,954 --> 00:28:45,013
What are we supposed to do
with this tabletop?

311
00:28:45,223 --> 00:28:46,747
Dude, l don't know.

312
00:28:46,958 --> 00:28:48,949
Looks like he's gonna end
with some 360s here.

313
00:28:49,160 --> 00:28:50,991
Looks like three or four
of them at least.

314
00:28:51,196 --> 00:28:53,460
Great run for Russ Howell.
Let's hear it for Russ.

315
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,530
What do l--?

316
00:29:00,038 --> 00:29:03,007
Next up, Ty Page,
riding for Unity Skateboards.

317
00:29:04,342 --> 00:29:07,778
Ty Page, starting off
with some 1 80 end-overs.

318
00:29:07,979 --> 00:29:11,779
And now l think he's gonna--
He's gonna press up into a handstand.

319
00:29:13,351 --> 00:29:16,980
There's a nice handstand across the
platform, back down onto his board.

320
00:29:18,423 --> 00:29:20,482
Looks like he's setting up
for, yes, a daffy...

321
00:29:20,692 --> 00:29:22,250
...and into a one-footed heelie.

322
00:29:23,027 --> 00:29:26,121
And ends up with a 360
in front of the judges.

323
00:29:26,331 --> 00:29:28,026
Nice run for Ty Page.

324
00:29:30,068 --> 00:29:33,629
Looks like a 9.5, a 9 and 1 0 for
Ty Page. Those are real good marks.

325
00:29:33,838 --> 00:29:36,398
Should put him right at the top
of the competition today.

326
00:29:36,608 --> 00:29:40,169
Next up, Jay Adams,
riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

327
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:42,673
And there we go.

328
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,129
Okay, here we go with Jay Adams.

329
00:30:02,767 --> 00:30:04,257
Nice.

330
00:30:07,672 --> 00:30:10,300
Doing these low--
These low, driving turns.

331
00:30:18,516 --> 00:30:19,710
Yeah, Jay boy.

332
00:30:19,918 --> 00:30:22,785
-Low 1 80 with Royal Christie.
-All right, Jay.

333
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:28,952
Oh, but he's all right.

334
00:30:35,633 --> 00:30:37,794
He's hopping up in the air
three or four inches.

335
00:30:38,002 --> 00:30:41,062
l don't even know what to call that.
l've never seen it.

336
00:30:43,074 --> 00:30:45,406
He's, like, off the ramp.

337
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:56,081
That's it for Jay Adams. Let's see what
the judges are gonna score him.

338
00:30:56,287 --> 00:30:58,949
Yeah, dude. Oh, my God.

339
00:30:59,157 --> 00:31:02,888
He didn't do a single wheelie.
He didn't do a single compulsory trick.

340
00:31:03,094 --> 00:31:05,119
Well, you gotta give him a score.

341
00:31:06,598 --> 00:31:08,657
Looks like two 7 s
and an 8 for Jay Adams...

342
00:31:08,867 --> 00:31:11,461
-Oh, come on.
-...riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

343
00:31:12,470 --> 00:31:14,131
You don't know how to judge.

344
00:31:14,339 --> 00:31:16,170
Hey, you blew me away.

345
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,865
What? You want to blow me?

346
00:31:20,044 --> 00:31:21,238
Maybe.

347
00:31:21,446 --> 00:31:24,244
Next up will be Tony Alva,
riding for Zephyr Skateboards.

348
00:31:24,449 --> 00:31:25,882
-Yeah.
-T.A.

349
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:30,778
Yeah.

350
00:31:32,323 --> 00:31:34,848
He started out with some
quick S-turns up onto the bank.

351
00:31:39,163 --> 00:31:41,563
-Frontside 1 80 power slide.
-That's it, T.A.

352
00:31:48,606 --> 00:31:50,301
Very nice walking spinner.

353
00:31:58,516 --> 00:32:01,246
lnto a 360, maybe a 540.

354
00:32:02,253 --> 00:32:04,949
Another low-driving turn,
touching his hands to the ground.

355
00:32:07,492 --> 00:32:08,686
Yeah.

356
00:32:09,193 --> 00:32:13,687
Here he comes toward the judges.
Ends up with a low-driving 360.

357
00:32:13,898 --> 00:32:15,263
That was a great run for Alva.

358
00:32:15,466 --> 00:32:17,457
Looks like we have
two 1 0s and a 9...

359
00:32:17,669 --> 00:32:19,728
-...the highest score of the day.
-Yeah.

360
00:32:19,938 --> 00:32:24,204
Up next from Mar Vista, California,
an independent skater, Stacy Peralta.

361
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,172
The dude showed.

362
00:32:26,377 --> 00:32:29,403
-Go, Stacy.
-Yeah, Stace.

363
00:32:30,949 --> 00:32:34,043
Come on, Stacy.

364
00:32:34,252 --> 00:32:37,085
-Yeah.
-Where'd that come from, Stace?

365
00:32:37,288 --> 00:32:41,588
Up, up, using the whole ramp,
hands on the ground.

366
00:32:42,994 --> 00:32:44,859
Yeah.

367
00:32:47,398 --> 00:32:49,559
And there's another one of those
low maneuvers...

368
00:32:49,767 --> 00:32:51,462
...out of the pages
of Surfer Magazine.

369
00:33:00,345 --> 00:33:02,108
Looks like he's winding up
for some 360s.

370
00:33:02,313 --> 00:33:04,941
One, two, three, four, five.

371
00:33:05,149 --> 00:33:08,778
Five 360s. Amazing.
We haven't seen that many all day.

372
00:33:10,054 --> 00:33:11,248
Hey, Stacy!

373
00:33:11,489 --> 00:33:13,650
Back across the flat
and there's his finish.

374
00:33:13,858 --> 00:33:18,386
Two 1 0s and a 9 bring him
into a first-place tie with Tony Alva.

375
00:33:19,163 --> 00:33:21,358
Oh, my God.

376
00:33:26,304 --> 00:33:28,465
-You're disqualified.
-What are you talking about?

377
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:30,698
-You touched the course.
-Everyone touched--

378
00:33:30,908 --> 00:33:32,569
Read the rules. You're disqualified.

379
00:33:32,777 --> 00:33:34,938
Hey, man. Hey, man. Look. Look.
The dude tied me.

380
00:33:35,146 --> 00:33:36,909
Can your dirty ass even read?

381
00:33:39,517 --> 00:33:41,508
-T.A.
-Yeah, Mad Dog.

382
00:33:41,719 --> 00:33:44,051
-My dirty ass, right?
-Hey, ease up. Ease up, man.

383
00:33:44,255 --> 00:33:45,745
-You saw that--
-Yeah, ease up.

384
00:33:45,957 --> 00:33:49,120
-Hey. Off the fairgrounds.
-Cut these kids some slack, man.

385
00:33:49,327 --> 00:33:50,385
-Slack?
-Yeah.

386
00:33:50,595 --> 00:33:53,758
Who do you think you are, coming
to our contest and pulling this shit?

387
00:33:53,965 --> 00:33:57,924
Pulling what shit, man? My boys
are kicking your girls' asses.

388
00:33:58,136 --> 00:34:00,195
Every judge on the panel
is on your payroll.

389
00:34:00,405 --> 00:34:02,498
What kind of shit is that, huh?

390
00:34:03,408 --> 00:34:05,035
Watch it.

391
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:06,574
-Yeah?
-Yeah.

392
00:34:06,778 --> 00:34:09,178
Step up to the plate, man.
One at a time.

393
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,348
You want it?
Come on, will it be all of you?

394
00:34:11,549 --> 00:34:14,848
Come on. Yeah?

395
00:34:15,319 --> 00:34:17,378
Come on.

396
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:21,925
Hey, look. All right.
lt's gone, all right?

397
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:25,095
Look, man.
These kids are at a tender age.

398
00:34:25,296 --> 00:34:27,696
-They tense easily, okay?
-Yeah.

399
00:34:27,899 --> 00:34:30,129
Your boy who punched
my official is out.

400
00:34:30,334 --> 00:34:31,733
-Oh, come on.
-No concession.

401
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:34,029
-That's bullshit.
-Tony Alva's been disqualified.

402
00:34:34,238 --> 00:34:36,729
-Next up, junior women's freestyle.
-Tony, wait.

403
00:34:36,941 --> 00:34:38,374
Tony.

404
00:34:38,876 --> 00:34:41,037
l just wanted Dad to see
the stupid trophy.

405
00:34:41,245 --> 00:34:44,009
-Who gives a shit about Dad?
-Yeah, hey, hey, T.A., man.

406
00:34:44,215 --> 00:34:47,582
Listen, you stood up for your friend,
man. We're proud of you.

407
00:34:47,785 --> 00:34:49,946
This contest don't mean shit
to me anyway!

408
00:34:50,154 --> 00:34:54,147
Hey, come here. Look at me. Look,
someone had to deck that asshole.

409
00:34:54,358 --> 00:34:56,087
Look at me. Look at me.

410
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,127
lt was either you or me, man.
All right? Okay?

411
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:01,628
Our freestyle champion today

412
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:04,631
...an independent skater
with a great surf style.

-...a real up-and-comer.
-All right, Jay.

416
00:35:17,982 --> 00:35:20,507

417
00:35:21,152 --> 00:35:22,881

-But l messed up.

That's a nice ride, man.

Yeah, well, suit yourself.

425
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:45,772
lt's one of the benefits
of having a job.

426
00:35:46,244 --> 00:35:48,712
Yeah, well, you got me there, man.

427
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:54,176
-We're going home.
-Okay.

428
00:35:56,087 --> 00:35:58,112
Skip called me bro.

429
00:35:58,322 --> 00:36:00,790
-Skip called you bro?
-Yeah, he said, ''bro.''

430

-No, he didn't.
-Yes, he did.

00:36:02,560 --> 00:36:04,619
He said, ''You look hungry, bro.''

00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,421
He said, ''You look hungry, bro''?

433
00:36:06,631 --> 00:36:08,758
Yes, totally.

434
00:36:08,966 --> 00:36:11,764
Skip Engblom
doesn't call anybody bro.

435
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:19,106
Let's see your trophies, Wentzle.

436
00:36:26,517 --> 00:36:28,280
Take a seat, man.

00:36:29,086 --> 00:36:31,179

-You earned it, bro.
-Dude, you're one of us now.

443
00:36:45,169 --> 00:36:47,103
That maggot's always

444
00:36:49,307 --> 00:36:52,970
-Yeah, wear it with pride, man.
-You know l will.

445
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:55,175
Hey, Stacy, that T-shirt...

00:36:55,379 --> 00:36:59,076
...will get you more titty
than you ever dreamed of, man.

448
00:37:04,088 --> 00:37:06,113

-Yeah, you do.
-Yeah!

450
00:37:09,760 --> 00:37:11,990
Hey, you guys made a mess
of that contest today.

451
00:37:12,196 --> 00:37:14,630
-Oh, yeah!
-Yeah!

452
00:37:15,866 --> 00:37:17,493
They look at you
as the enemy, right?

453
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,170
-But it's good to have enemies.
-Yeah.

454
00:37:20,371 --> 00:37:22,305
-A toast.
-A toast!

455
00:37:22,506 --> 00:37:23,700
To the boy kings!

456
00:37:24,742 --> 00:37:28,508
You're all a bunch
of filthy pillow-biters!

457
00:37:28,713 --> 00:37:31,204
-We learn from the best!
-Oh, you're dead.

458
00:37:31,415 --> 00:37:32,677
Stop! Stop!

459
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:36,375
You can't act like that here.
This is a family restaurant!

460
00:37:39,390 --> 00:37:40,755
Hey, get off him!

461
00:37:42,059 --> 00:37:43,185
Hey! Hey!

462
00:37:43,394 --> 00:37:44,884
lt's a family restaurant!

463
00:37:46,197 --> 00:37:48,188
-Get him, Skip.
-Go, Skip!

464
00:38:11,522 --> 00:38:13,490
Jay boy.

465
00:38:14,859 --> 00:38:17,020
You kicked ass, man.

466
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:20,663
See you, Skip.

467
00:38:38,282 --> 00:38:40,443
l got second place, Mom.

468
00:38:40,651 --> 00:38:42,642
You would've been stoked.

469
00:38:47,491 --> 00:38:48,856
Baby.

470
00:38:49,060 --> 00:38:50,618
Baby.

471
00:38:53,230 --> 00:38:56,165
l wish l could've been there
to see you.

472
00:38:57,501 --> 00:38:59,162
What time do you get off?

473
00:39:01,372 --> 00:39:03,533
Three more hours.

474
00:39:04,575 --> 00:39:07,169
There's fish sticks
in the freezer, baby.

475
00:39:08,879 --> 00:39:12,076
You know, l'm gonna make some cash
and get you out of this place.

476
00:39:28,032 --> 00:39:30,330
Relax, Sylvia.

477
00:40:59,023 --> 00:41:02,356
-lt's still flat.
-Yeah. Three days in a row.

478
00:41:02,560 --> 00:41:03,925
Hey!

479
00:41:04,628 --> 00:41:05,595
Get in.

480
00:41:08,299 --> 00:41:09,664
Stop, stop, stop.

481
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:11,562
Right here. Right here.

482
00:41:15,406 --> 00:41:17,931
Hey, isn't that the girl from Del Mar?

483
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:23,340
-Dude, what are we doing here?
-Shut up, dork.

484
00:41:23,547 --> 00:41:25,208
And sit back.

485
00:41:32,423 --> 00:41:33,856
Damn it, Jay!

486
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,788
You know how much this is
gonna cost me? You're an idiot!

487
00:41:38,262 --> 00:41:39,593
Jesus.

488
00:41:42,366 --> 00:41:44,800
-Down, guys.
-Get down. Get down.

489
00:41:45,002 --> 00:41:46,492
Sid, get off me.

490
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,469
Grab your skates, boys. Let's roll.

491
00:41:56,313 --> 00:41:58,611
Dude, are we gonna rob this place?

492
00:42:07,858 --> 00:42:10,520
This wave breaks 2 4 hours a day,
every day.

493
00:42:10,728 --> 00:42:14,425
And you know what, bros?
We're gonna be the first to ride it!

494
00:42:18,269 --> 00:42:20,169
Dude! That's so genius.

495
00:42:20,371 --> 00:42:23,204
Dude, there's no way.
This is way too gnarly.

496
00:42:23,407 --> 00:42:25,534
Not if you got the balls.

497
00:42:34,184 --> 00:42:35,344
Dude.

498
00:42:48,299 --> 00:42:50,665
-Oh, Jay.
-Dude, you did a backflip.

499
00:42:53,170 --> 00:42:55,730
Let's lose this stupid diving board.

500
00:42:55,940 --> 00:42:57,635
Piece of shit.

501
00:42:59,109 --> 00:43:01,304
Dude, hit it low, man.

502
00:43:01,512 --> 00:43:02,638
Yeah, Tony!

503
00:43:02,846 --> 00:43:04,905
Yeah! You guys see that?
l carved it.

504
00:43:07,217 --> 00:43:08,377
Over the light.

505
00:43:08,586 --> 00:43:09,917
Oh, my God!

506
00:43:10,120 --> 00:43:13,180
-Dude, you were so far over it.
-That was crazy.

507
00:43:15,092 --> 00:43:17,287
-Yes!
-Yeah!

508
00:43:41,051 --> 00:43:42,348
Are you all right, man?

509
00:43:46,090 --> 00:43:47,580
l can't feel my feet.

510
00:43:53,030 --> 00:43:56,193
But then again,
l can never feel my feet.

511
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:03,336
-Right there! Through there.
-Where?

512
00:44:04,341 --> 00:44:06,434
l love the drought!

513
00:44:17,087 --> 00:44:19,988
There's a pool right next door!
lt's an amoeba!

514
00:44:30,434 --> 00:44:33,062
