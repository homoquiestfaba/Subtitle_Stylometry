00:00:35,560 --> 00:00:37,551
<i>My name is Richard.</i>

2
00:00:39,640 --> 00:00:41,631
<i>So what else do you need to know?</i>

3
00:00:41,720 --> 00:00:44,154
<i>Stuff about my family or where I'm from?</i>

4
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,791
<i>None of that matters.</i>

5
00:00:48,280 --> 00:00:51,556
<i>Not once you cross the ocean
and cut yourself loose...</i>

6
00:00:51,640 --> 00:00:55,633
<i>...looking for something more beautlful,
something more exciting...</i>

7
00:00:55,720 --> 00:00:58,632
<i>...and yes, I admit,
something more dangerous.</i>

8
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:02,673
<i>So after 18 hours in the back of an airplane...</i>

9
00:01:02,760 --> 00:01:07,151
<i>...three dumb movies, two plastic meals,
six beers and absolutely no sleep...</i>

10
00:01:07,240 --> 00:01:09,117
<i>...I finally touch down...</i>

11
00:01:09,200 --> 00:01:11,589
<i>- Hey, you! How about you?
... in Bangkok.</i>

12
00:01:11,680 --> 00:01:14,399
Do you want to go to the waterfall?
Floating market!

13
00:01:14,480 --> 00:01:16,516
1,500. Cheap for you! Come on! Hey!

14
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:19,071
Hey! Do you need somewhere to stay?

15
00:01:19,160 --> 00:01:21,913
- I'll find my own place, thanks.
- What you want, man?

16
00:01:22,000 --> 00:01:24,230
<i>And this is it. Bangkok.</i>

17
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,311
<i>Good- time city.</i>

18
00:01:26,400 --> 00:01:28,391
<i>Gateway to Southeast Asia.</i>

19
00:01:28,480 --> 00:01:33,156
<i>Where dollars and Deutschmarks get turned
into counterfeit watches and genuine scars.</i>

20
00:01:33,240 --> 00:01:35,629
Good time! Boy! Girl! Fucking!
No problem!

21
00:01:35,720 --> 00:01:39,599
<i>- This is where the hungry come to feed.
- You wanna drink snake blood?</i>

22
00:01:40,440 --> 00:01:42,510
Wait a minute. Did you say snake blood?

23
00:01:42,600 --> 00:01:44,591
Oh, yeah!

24
00:01:45,560 --> 00:01:48,028
- No, thanks.
- What is wrong with snake blood?

25
00:01:48,120 --> 00:01:51,954
- I just... don't like the idea.
- Maybe you're scared.

26
00:01:52,040 --> 00:01:54,759
- Afraid of something new.
- I just don't like the idea.

27
00:01:54,840 --> 00:01:56,637
Like every tourist!

28
00:01:56,720 --> 00:01:58,711
You want it all be safe.

29
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:00,791
Just like America!

30
00:02:03,640 --> 00:02:05,551
<i>So never refuse an invitation.</i>

31
00:02:07,120 --> 00:02:10,112
<i>Never resist the unfamiliar.</i>

32
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,191
<i>Never fail to be polite.</i>

33
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:29,157
Gentlemen...

34
00:02:29,240 --> 00:02:31,231
<i>...that was excellent.</i>

35
00:02:31,320 --> 00:02:33,311
<i>And never outstay your welcome.</i>

36
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:38,270
<i>Just keep your mind open
and suck in the experience.</i>

37
00:02:39,120 --> 00:02:41,111
<i>And If it hurts...</i>

38
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,191
<i>...it's probably worth it.</i>

39
00:02:44,800 --> 00:02:45,994
Hey.

40
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,071
- Good evening.
- Hi.

41
00:02:48,160 --> 00:02:50,310

No, you don't.

No, you're right. I don't.

00:06:09,320 --> 00:06:11,311
<i>Ahh, that's better!</i>

00:06:15,560 --> 00:06:17,551
<i>Thanks.</i>

78
00:06:18,600 --> 00:06:20,670
It was the beach. You understand?

79
00:06:21,880 --> 00:06:24,713
The beach. It was too...

80
00:06:25,280 --> 00:06:30,195
...beautiful. Too much input, too much...
sensation. I-I try to keep it under control...

81

<i>...but itjust keeps spilling out
and spilling out and spilling out.</i>

82

You see, erm...

83
00:06:38,120 --> 00:06:40,111
...she's on an island.

84
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:44,193
And the island is... is perfect.

85
00:06:44,280 --> 00:06:47,352
I mean... I mean, real perfection here.

86
00:06:47,440 --> 00:06:50,750
I'm notjust talking about... "Oh, that's nice. "

87
00:06:52,240 --> 00:06:54,231
It's the real fuckin' deal, OK?

88
00:06:56,320 --> 00:06:58,311
It's perfect.

89
00:06:58,400 --> 00:07:01,119
See, it's like a... a lagoon.

90
00:07:01,200 --> 00:07:03,191
Ya know, a tidal... lagoon.

91
00:07:03,280 --> 00:07:05,271
See, it's sealed in by cliffs.

92
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:08,193
Totally fuckin' secret, totally fuckin'...

93
00:07:08,280 --> 00:07:10,271
...forbidden.

94
00:07:10,360 --> 00:07:12,237
And nobody can ever, ever...

95
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,311
...ever, ever go there. Ever.

96
00:07:16,120 --> 00:07:17,951
But a few people went...

97
00:07:18,040 --> 00:07:20,190
<i>...once upon a time.</i>

98
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:23,238
Men and women with ideals.
You understand?

99
00:07:23,320 --> 00:07:27,518
I'm notjust talking about the usual...
travellin' fuckin' wanks.

100
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,551
Do you believe in that place?

101
00:07:31,440 --> 00:07:33,396
No.

102
00:07:33,480 --> 00:07:36,756
But I guess you're gonna tell me
that I should, right?

103
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:44,712
It doesnae fuckin' matter
what I think any more.

104
00:07:44,800 --> 00:07:46,791
It's up to you.

105
00:07:48,160 --> 00:07:50,276
Ideals, eh?

106
00:07:50,360 --> 00:07:52,476
We were just fuckin' parasites!

107
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,949
The big, chunky Charlie!

108
00:07:59,640 --> 00:08:01,631
See, I-I was the one...

109
00:08:01,720 --> 00:08:05,554
<i>...that was trying to find the cure.
Procurer of the cure.</i>

110
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,230
I said to them "You've got to leave. "

111
00:08:09,800 --> 00:08:12,598
"You've got to leave this place. "

112
00:08:14,200 --> 00:08:16,316
But they wouldnae listen.

113
00:08:20,120 --> 00:08:22,793
No offence an' all, but...

114
00:08:23,880 --> 00:08:26,394
...you're fucked in the head, right?

115
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,071
Here, Richard.

116
00:08:45,440 --> 00:08:47,431
It's been nice knowin' you, man.

117
00:08:49,280 --> 00:08:51,271
Yeah. You, too.

118
00:09:16,400 --> 00:09:18,994
Be careful! Electric... Electricity!

119
00:09:20,760 --> 00:09:23,991
<i>- Ma'am! Ma'am!
- Chill, man!</i>

120
00:09:24,080 --> 00:09:26,116
No worry!

121
00:09:33,200 --> 00:09:34,918
Hey! Man.

122
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:36,991
There is a letter for you.

123
00:09:37,080 --> 00:09:38,877
A what?

124
00:09:38,960 --> 00:09:40,757
Letter on your door.

125
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:05,031
No fuckin' way!

126
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,079
Do you...

127
00:10:25,280 --> 00:10:27,271
<i>Hello?</i>

128
00:11:00,160 --> 00:11:02,151
<i>You hope...</i>

129
00:11:02,800 --> 00:11:04,631
<i>...and you dream...</i>

130
00:11:06,040 --> 00:11:09,430
<i>...but you never believe that
something's gonna happen for you.</i>

131
00:11:10,960 --> 00:11:12,951
<i>Not like it does in the movies.</i>

132
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:18,031
<i>And when it actually does...</i>

133
00:11:19,840 --> 00:11:21,831
<i>...you want it to feel different.</i>

134
00:11:24,440 --> 00:11:26,829
<i>More visceral.</i>

135
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:29,275
<i>More real.</i>

136
00:11:36,920 --> 00:11:38,911
<i>I was waiting for it to hit me.</i>

137
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:44,311
<i>But it just wouldn't happen.</i>

138

<i>The police were pissed because he was
travelling under a false passport.</i>

00:11:57,000 --> 00:11:58,991
Go ahead, sign the statement.

143
00:12:06,960 --> 00:12:08,871
It's OK.

144
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:13,078
It just say he cut his wrists -
already dead when you found him.

145
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:17,274
<i>But they didn't ask me about the map, so...</i>

146
00:12:17,360 --> 00:12:18,873
No problem.

147
00:12:18,960 --> 00:12:21,838
<i>...I didn't tell 'em.</i>

Good luck!

150
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:37,751
Excuse me.

151
00:12:42,200 --> 00:12:44,191
Look... I mean...

152
00:12:45,720 --> 00:12:48,314
<i>...this island may not actually even exist.</i>

153
00:12:48,400 --> 00:12:51,039
Even if it does, I don't know
if we can get there or not.

154
00:12:51,120 --> 00:12:53,873
I just wondered if you wanted
to come with me.

155
00:12:53,960 --> 00:12:55,951
That's all.

156
00:13:08,320 --> 00:13:10,436
Hey! You wanna take a hike?

157
00:13:11,200 --> 00:13:13,191
Uh... a-a trip, ajourney?

158
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,791
With y-your girlfriend and me?

159
00:13:15,880 --> 00:13:18,075
I mean, the two of you and me. Together.

160
00:13:18,160 --> 00:13:20,628
- I-I'm talking about the secret isla...
- Hi.

161
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,994
Hi.

162
00:13:25,760 --> 00:13:29,389
I just feel like everyone tries
to do something different, but...

163
00:13:29,480 --> 00:13:31,789
<i>...you always wind up doing the same thing.</i>

164
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:39,398
<i>I realised that I had absolutely no idea
of how I was gonna get there.</i>

165
00:13:41,520 --> 00:13:43,078
<i>But Étienne...</i>

166
00:13:43,160 --> 00:13:46,516
<i>I mean, I have to hand it
to the guy. He was great.</i>

167
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:49,194
<i>I mean, he organised
the whole thing - tickets...</i>

168
00:13:49,280 --> 00:13:51,510
<i>...timetables, the whole damn trip.</i>

169
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:55,559
<i>Bangkok to Surat Thani.
Surat Thani to Na Thon.</i>

170
00:13:55,640 --> 00:13:57,631
<i>Na Thon to Chaweng.</i>

00:13:57,720 --> 00:13:59,950
<i>500 miles in 24 hours...</i>

172
00:14:00,040 --> 00:14:02,429
<i>...at less than 400 baht.</i>

173
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:05,470
<i>Trust me, that's a very good deal.</i>

174
00:14:10,600 --> 00:14:12,909
<i>We were headed for the great unknown.</i>

175
00:14:13,000 --> 00:14:16,913
<i>But to get there, we had to follow
the regular tourist trail.</i>

176
00:14:32,440 --> 00:14:35,273
<i># A little less pushin'

183
00:14:46,000 --> 00:14:49,549
It's arranged. Tomorrow morning. 1800 baht.

184
00:14:49,640 --> 00:14:51,437
Ah, great man! Nice work!

185
00:14:51,520 --> 00:14:54,398
There is one problem.
He will not take us to the island.

186
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:57,950
It's in the national park
and it's forbidden to go there. But...

187
00:14:58,680 --> 00:15:01,911
<i>...we are allowed to travel to this one
to stay for one night.</i>

188
00:15:02,000 --> 00:15:04,116
Yeah... No, see, that's the wrong one.

189
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:06,191
Yeah, I know that.

190
00:15:06,280 --> 00:15:08,510
Right. But how do we get
from there to there?

191
00:15:08,600 --> 00:15:11,273
- We swim.
- We swim?

192
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:14,830
Yeah. We leave our rucksacks
on this island and then we swim.

193
00:15:14,920 --> 00:15:18,879
- You can swim, can't you, Richard?
- Of course I can swim.

194
00:15:18,960 --> 00:15:22,270
- So no problem.
- So h-how far is it, though?

195
00:15:22,360 --> 00:15:24,430
I don't know. One or two kilometres.

196
00:15:24,520 --> 00:15:28,479
- Cool. Cool... Not far at all
- Stop it, Richard. It will be worth it.

197
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,438
An adventure. And just... the three of us.

198
00:15:38,640 --> 00:15:40,471
Uh-oh.

199
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,309
<i>"Can you swim?"</i>

200
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:48,996
"I can swim! Oh, yeah! I am French and
I have the beautiful girlfriend, too! Huh!"

201
00:15:51,840 --> 00:15:53,831
Great

202
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:56,388
<i>- Goddammit!
- Locked out, huh?</i>

203
00:15:57,960 --> 00:15:59,951
Yeah.

204
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,351
<i>- Lost your key?
- Uh-huh.</i>

205
00:16:04,840 --> 00:16:06,831
<i>- Bummer!
- Yeah, bummer!</i>

206
00:16:08,360 --> 00:16:11,591
So, uh... you wanna
grab a beer or somethin'?

207
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:21,829
- You're better off without her.
- Sammy, how the fuck would you know?!

208
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,911
You've never even met her!

209
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:27,356
I'm just tryin' to help the guy
through the dark times.

210
00:16:27,440 --> 00:16:30,034
- It's not a problem.
- You see, Zeph?

211
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:33,271
- It's not a problem.
- Change the fuckin' subject.

212
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:38,631
All right. Let's talk about how you spend
an hour in front of the mirror every day.

213
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:42,872
<i>Oh, that's nice You know this guy?
He likes to wipe his ass with tree leaves.</i>

214
00:16:42,960 --> 00:16:46,236
He thinks he's some sort of
jungle commando.

215
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:47,992
<i>- Whatever.
- I swear to God!</i>

216
00:16:48,080 --> 00:16:50,071
<i>- Whatever.
- Damn!</i>

217
00:16:50,160 --> 00:16:51,957
I presume...

218
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:55,077
<i>...you know the story
of the Kentucky fried mouse.</i>

219
00:16:55,160 --> 00:16:56,798
Yeah.

220
00:16:56,880 --> 00:16:58,871
Woman bites into a chicken leg...

221
00:16:58,960 --> 00:17:01,190
<i>...and it turns out to be, uh... a mouse.</i>

222
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:02,554
Right?

223
00:17:02,640 --> 00:17:04,631
It's an urban myth.

224
00:17:05,640 --> 00:17:09,838
Exactly. It always happened
to a friend of a friend of someone else.

225
00:17:09,920 --> 00:17:11,638
- So?
- So...

226
00:17:11,720 --> 00:17:15,918
<i>...I guess there's this urban myth
goin' around here at the moment.</i>

227
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,638
It's about a beach.

228
00:17:19,280 --> 00:17:21,271
- Yeah?
- Uh-huh.

229
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:24,636
And this beach is... perfect, man.

230
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,711
It's on an island, right?

231
00:17:27,200 --> 00:17:29,350
Hidden from the sea.

232
00:17:30,080 --> 00:17:32,071
Now, imagine. You got...

233
00:17:32,160 --> 00:17:33,718
<i>...pure white sand.</i>

234
00:17:33,800 --> 00:17:35,791
Crystal-clear water.

235
00:17:35,880 --> 00:17:38,838
<i>- Palm trees.
- Yeah, with coconuts and shit!</i>

236
00:17:38,920 --> 00:17:41,195
Yo, tell him the best part, dawg.

237
00:17:41,280 --> 00:17:42,269
Plus...

238
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:44,351
...enough dope, Richard...

239
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:47,079
<i>...to smoke all day, every day...</i>

240
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:50,311
<i>- ... for the rest of your goddamn life!
- Yeah! Mad weed!</i>

241
00:17:52,280 --> 00:17:57,673
<i>Only a few people know exactly where
it is, and they keep it absolutely secret.</i>

242
00:17:57,760 --> 00:18:00,672
No one's actually ever met
any of these people.

243
00:18:00,760 --> 00:18:03,149
Exactly. It's a Kentucky fried mouse!

244
00:18:03,240 --> 00:18:04,229
Hm!

245
00:18:04,320 --> 00:18:06,993
Although, if I had a key to a place like that...

246
00:18:07,080 --> 00:18:12,393
<i>...I'd keep it to myself cos... you don't want
every fuckin' asshole in Thailand...</i>

247
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:14,198
...turnin' up! Boo-boo!

248
00:18:14,280 --> 00:18:16,430
<i>Yeah, yeah.</i>

249
00:18:16,520 --> 00:18:18,988
So whaddaya think
about that story, Richard?

250
00:18:22,200 --> 00:18:23,952
It's good.

251
00:18:24,040 --> 00:18:26,031
It's a good story.

252
00:18:26,120 --> 00:18:28,680
Hey, you! I got your key!

253
00:18:31,280 --> 00:18:33,794
<i>Now, I know it wasn't a part of the plan...</i>

254
00:18:33,880 --> 00:18:36,872
<i>...but I made a decision
to leave a copy of the map.</i>

255
00:18:37,640 --> 00:18:40,916
<i>I'm not gonna say it was
the best decision I ever made.</i>

256
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:46,237
<i>I told myself that spreading news
is a part of a traveller's nature.</i>

257
00:18:47,280 --> 00:18:49,635
<i>But If I was being completely honest...</i>

258
00:18:50,680 --> 00:18:52,750
<i>...I was just like everybody else:</i>

259
00:18:53,560 --> 00:18:55,869
<i>...shit-scared of the great unknown.</i>

260
00:18:56,600 --> 00:18:59,592
<i>Desperate to take
a little piece of home with me.</i>

261
00:19:11,720 --> 00:19:14,712
<i>- Richard?
- Are you ready?</i>

262
00:19:14,800 --> 00:19:16,791
Yeah, yeah. I'm coming.

263
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:20,871
Let's go.

264
00:20:01,840 --> 00:20:03,831
<i># Feel dead</i>

265
00:20:04,120 --> 00:20:05,872
<i># Feel dead</i>

266
00:20:06,400 --> 00:20:08,038
<i># Feel dead</i>

267
00:20:08,400 --> 00:20:10,595
<i># Feel dead</i>

00:20:10,680 --> 00:20:13,672
<i># Happy</i>

269
00:20:17,960 --> 00:20:19,359
Françoise?

270
00:20:19,440 --> 00:20:21,954
<i>Chut! Étienne will be angry if I wake him.</i>

271
00:20:22,040 --> 00:20:25,271
He thinks I waste time,
taking photographs of the sky.

272
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:29,111
Oh...

273
00:20:34,640 --> 00:20:37,632
- I think so, too.
- Yeah?

274
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:39,711
Have a look.

275
00:20:41,960 --> 00:20:44,793
One night, I will get the perfect photograph.

276
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,154
Hi!

277
00:20:56,240 --> 00:20:58,231
Whoa!

278
00:21:10,920 --> 00:21:12,911
You realise that...

279
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,991
<i>...in the eternity of space...</i>

280
00:21:17,040 --> 00:21:20,157
...there's probably a planet out there, right...

281
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:22,631
<i>...just like this one...</i>

282
00:21:22,720 --> 00:21:24,392
...where another you...

283
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:27,074
<i>...is photographing back down towards us.</i>

284
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:32,357
I mean, essentially, you are photographing
yourself in a parallel universe.

285
00:21:32,440 --> 00:21:34,431
Incredible.

286
00:21:35,560 --> 00:21:37,551
Yeah...

287
00:21:37,640 --> 00:21:40,108
There are infinite worlds out there, ya know?

288
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:42,509
Where anything you want to happen...

289
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,238
<i>...does happen.</i>

290
00:21:44,320 --> 00:21:46,311
Richard, do you know something?

291
00:21:46,400 --> 00:21:47,355
Hm?

292
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,238
This is just the kind of pretentious bullshit...

293
00:21:50,320 --> 00:21:54,074
...Americans always say to French girls...
so they can sleep with them.

294
00:21:57,000 --> 00:21:58,991
God! Sorry.

295
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:01,150
I thought I was doin' pretty good.

296
00:22:01,240 --> 00:22:03,629
It's just the sky, Richard. Let's try.

297
00:22:04,080 --> 00:22:06,071
Yeah.

298
00:22:06,160 --> 00:22:08,151
<i>Idiot.</i>

299
00:22:12,000 --> 00:22:14,594
<i>Un, deux, trois...</i>

300
00:22:14,680 --> 00:22:15,590
<i>...quatre.</i>

301
00:22:15,680 --> 00:22:18,877
<i>When you develop
an infatuation for someone...</i>

302
00:22:18,960 --> 00:22:23,317
<i>...you always find a reason to believe
that this is exactly the person for you.</i>

303
00:22:23,400 --> 00:22:25,550
<i>It doesn't need to be a good reason.</i>

304
00:22:25,640 --> 00:22:28,757
<i>Taking photographs of the night sky,
for example.</i>

305
00:22:28,840 --> 00:22:30,831
<i>Now, in the long run...</i>

306
00:22:30,920 --> 00:22:35,596
<i>...that's just the kind of dumb, irritating habit
that would cause you to split up.</i>

307
00:22:35,680 --> 00:22:37,830
<i>But in the haze of infatuation...</i>

308
00:22:38,560 --> 00:22:42,269
<i>...it's just what you've been searching for
all these years.</i>

309
00:22:48,360 --> 00:22:50,954
<i>- One kilometre.
- Two.</i>

310
00:22:51,040 --> 00:22:54,794
<i>- Richard?
- I don't know. I'm American.</i>

311
00:22:54,880 --> 00:22:57,952
- So?
- We think in miles, not kilometres.

312
00:22:58,040 --> 00:23:00,429
OK. So how many miles do you think it is?

313
00:23:01,480 --> 00:23:04,995
I don't know.
But it looks like a long way away.

314
00:23:05,080 --> 00:23:07,640
If it's too far, we're gonna drown.

315
00:23:12,080 --> 00:23:14,469
But if we don't try,
we'll never know, right?

316
00:23:15,520 --> 00:23:17,192
Right.

317
00:23:21,080 --> 00:23:23,230
So let's go!

318
00:23:30,560 --> 00:23:32,198
<i>Whoo!</i>

319
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,272
<i>- Are you guys all right?
- Yeah, we're OK.</i>

320
00:23:59,360 --> 00:24:01,351
I think we're about halfway.

321
00:24:05,160 --> 00:24:07,799
Oh, fuck! Richard!

322
00:24:08,480 --> 00:24:10,471
<i>- Fuck!
- What?</i>

323
00:24:10,560 --> 00:24:12,232
I saw a fin!

324
00:24:12,320 --> 00:24:15,198
<i>- Tsk! What? Are you joking?
- No, no, no!</i>

325
00:24:15,280 --> 00:24:16,838
A fin!

326
00:24:17,840 --> 00:24:19,239
OK, a shark fin?

327
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:23,108
I don't know. Just a fin.
Over there, about 100 metres.

328
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:28,312
- Well, was it big?
- Yes.

329
00:24:30,240 --> 00:24:32,435
What the fuck do you expect me
to do about it?!

330
00:24:32,520 --> 00:24:34,988
Nothing! I just thought you should know.

331
00:24:35,080 --> 00:24:37,230
To be honest, I'd rather you hadn't told me!

332
00:24:37,320 --> 00:24:41,108
- OK, I'm sorry.
- Well, it's a bit fuckin' late now, isn't it?!

333
00:24:51,880 --> 00:24:55,111
Françoise! Françoise! She's gone!

334
00:24:55,200 --> 00:24:56,758
Oh, my God!

335
00:24:56,840 --> 00:25:01,550
<i>- Oh, my God! OK, what happened?
- She just went under the water!</i>

336
00:25:01,640 --> 00:25:03,631
She was pulled under!

337
00:25:05,360 --> 00:25:06,793
<i>Françoise!</i>

338
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:09,519
Françoise! I don't see her!

339
00:25:10,280 --> 00:25:12,111
Oh, fuck! It's her bag!

340
00:25:12,200 --> 00:25:15,715
OK. Was there a shark?
Did you see a shark, Étienne?

341
00:25:15,800 --> 00:25:19,472
I don't know!

342
00:25:19,560 --> 00:25:21,391
Fuck!

343
00:25:21,920 --> 00:25:23,035
Don't fuck me!

344
00:25:29,920 --> 00:25:32,036
<i>Fuck you!</i>

345
00:25:34,200 --> 00:25:36,111
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

346
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,840
Oh, you Europeans, you're so funny

347
00:25:40,920 --> 00:25:43,798
You have such a playful sense of humour

348
00:25:43,880 --> 00:25:46,917
No wonder your comedy
has conquered the world

349
00:25:47,000 --> 00:25:49,594
- What about Molière?
- Who?

350
00:25:50,120 --> 00:25:51,712
Oh, fuck off!

351
00:26:45,680 --> 00:26:47,318
<i>- Agh!
- Come on.</i>

352
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,991
<i>Wow!</i>

353
00:27:13,040 --> 00:27:16,112
Now, this is what I call a lot of dope!

354
00:27:21,080 --> 00:27:23,071
<i>Oh, putain!</i>

355
00:27:29,080 --> 00:27:31,071
<i>T'as du papier à rouler?</i>

356
00:27:39,720 --> 00:27:42,109
Hey! Tch, tch, tch!

357
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,751
OK... OK...

358
00:28:48,480 --> 00:28:51,836
<i>We're gonna go this way.
OK? Shut up. Shut up.</i>

359
00:30:16,200 --> 00:30:18,191
Argh! Agh!

360
00:30:20,000 --> 00:30:21,718
Aï!

361
00:30:30,880 --> 00:30:32,871
<i>Sure, we should've turned back.</i>

362
00:30:33,640 --> 00:30:35,631
<i>But I wasn't going to.</i>

363
00:30:35,720 --> 00:30:37,711
<i>Not now.</i>

364
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:40,234
<i>I just kept telling them we'd get there.</i>

365
00:30:40,320 --> 00:30:41,833
<i>"Trust me...</i>

366
00:30:41,920 --> 00:30:44,195
<i>...it's paradise. "</i>

367
00:30:44,280 --> 00:30:47,317
If we take this down,
it should lead us all the way.

368
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,831
Come on!

369
00:31:22,400 --> 00:31:24,391
<i>Oh, God!</i>

370
00:31:32,640 --> 00:31:35,438
<i>Putain de merde!</i>

371
00:31:40,960 --> 00:31:42,951
<i>Well?</i>

372
00:31:43,040 --> 00:31:46,510
<i>- Well what?
- How do we get down?</i>

373
00:31:46,600 --> 00:31:49,956
How am I supposed to know?
Do I have to decide everything?

374
00:31:50,040 --> 00:31:53,032
- We'll jump.
- Fuck! You wanted to be in command!

375
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:56,908
I only took command because
you lost your nerve, French boy!

376
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,309
Yeah. And look where you've taken us!

377
00:32:00,560 --> 00:32:02,551
- We'll jump.
- If you're not happy...

378
00:32:02,640 --> 00:32:04,949
<i>...you can just take over. All right, sir?!</i>

379
00:32:05,040 --> 00:32:06,951
<i>All right, I will.</i>

380
00:32:07,040 --> 00:32:10,316
- There. We climb down there.
- We can jump.

381
00:32:10,400 --> 00:32:13,358
Françoise! Look... We're not gonnajump!

382
00:32:13,440 --> 00:32:16,432
All right? So just can it!
And as for climbing down there...

383
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:17,748
<i>...that is just...</i>

384
00:32:17,840 --> 00:32:20,513
<i>...an asshole suggestion!</i>

385
00:32:22,680 --> 00:32:26,753
- Calling me an asshole?
- Yeah. And that's just the start of it.

386
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:29,513
- All right, fuckface, let's do it!
- Motherfucker!

387
00:32:30,200 --> 00:32:31,394
<i>Françoise!</i>

388
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,839
- Shit!
- Françoise!

389
00:32:43,000 --> 00:32:45,275
Come on, guys! It's OK!

390
00:32:45,360 --> 00:32:48,511
It's not dangerous! Come on!

391
00:32:48,600 --> 00:32:50,955
Drop the bags down! Come on!

392
00:32:51,040 --> 00:32:53,838
All right. So we'll jump.

393
00:32:53,920 --> 00:32:56,354
Oh, fuck!

394
00:33:06,240 --> 00:33:08,708
<i>Whoa!</i>

395
00:33:08,800 --> 00:33:10,711
Whoo-hoo!

396
00:33:10,800 --> 00:33:12,950
Did you see that? Shit!

397
00:33:13,040 --> 00:33:15,031
Whoo! Whoo-hoo!

398
00:33:15,120 --> 00:33:16,348
Yes!

399
00:33:16,440 --> 00:33:18,431
Whoo-hoo!

400
00:33:28,720 --> 00:33:31,280
<i>Oh, my God!</i>

401
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,758
Congratulations!

402
00:33:35,840 --> 00:33:39,435
Took me the best part of an hour
to work up the balls to do that.

403
00:33:41,440 --> 00:33:46,070
Mind you, I was on my own, so you have to
make allowances. Ya know what I mean?

404
00:33:47,520 --> 00:33:50,114
I think maybe you'd better meet up with Sal.

405
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:52,998
Jesus Christ! We're fuckin' here!

406
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,196
Do ya realise that?

407
00:33:58,680 --> 00:34:00,671
Don't you go anywhere!

408
00:34:07,040 --> 00:34:08,632
All right.

409
00:34:08,720 --> 00:34:10,711
You're doin' well.

410
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:14,956
<i>- Ciao! Sonja! ¿A que sí?
- Hi.</i>

411
00:34:20,480 --> 00:34:22,471
<i>Noisy kitchen!</i>

412
00:34:22,560 --> 00:34:24,357
How are ya doin'?

413
00:34:24,440 --> 00:34:27,238
- What's for dinner?
- One guess. Fish.

414
00:34:27,320 --> 00:34:29,276
<i>I don't know what we expected.</i>

415
00:34:29,360 --> 00:34:32,830
<i>People living in a cave,
maybe even a few guys in tents.</i>

416
00:34:32,920 --> 00:34:34,114
Gregorio!

417
00:34:34,200 --> 00:34:36,111
<i>But nothing like this.</i>

418
00:34:36,200 --> 00:34:38,156
- How are you, Keaty?
- Don't smoke 'em!

419
00:34:38,240 --> 00:34:40,800
<i>It was like we arrived into a lost world.</i>

420
00:34:40,880 --> 00:34:46,637
<i>A full-scale community of travellers - not just
passing through, but actually living here.</i>

421
00:34:50,240 --> 00:34:52,231
<i>I suddenly became aware...</i>

422
00:34:53,000 --> 00:34:54,991
<i>...that we weren't even invited.</i>

423
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:03,720
<i>- The guy who drew it?
- Daffy.</i>

424
00:35:04,360 --> 00:35:06,749
Yeah... Yeah. He's dead.

425
00:35:06,840 --> 00:35:08,956
<i>What? No way!</i>

426
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:12,715
Yeah. He cut his wrists open
in a hotel room on the Khao San Road.

427
00:35:12,800 --> 00:35:15,792
- You have seen this?!
- Well, I came afterwards.

428
00:35:18,200 --> 00:35:20,998
Well, that's sad news.

429
00:35:21,920 --> 00:35:24,832
He was... one of the founders
of our community.

430
00:35:24,920 --> 00:35:26,478
Oh.

431
00:35:26,560 --> 00:35:28,551
But he became depressed.

432
00:35:28,640 --> 00:35:31,029
<i>Crazy.</i>

433
00:35:32,240 --> 00:35:37,030
The police didn't know what to do with
the body, so I guess they'll incinerate him.

434
00:35:41,520 --> 00:35:44,512
Do you think he gave a map to anybody else?

435
00:35:44,600 --> 00:35:46,750
I- I... No, I don't think so.

436
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:50,234
And you. Have you
shown this map to anybody?

437
00:35:50,320 --> 00:35:51,309
No.

438
00:35:52,000 --> 00:35:52,989
No.

439
00:35:53,920 --> 00:35:55,399
No.

440
00:35:57,280 --> 00:35:58,474
Good.

441
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:03,598
We value our secrecy.

442
00:36:07,560 --> 00:36:09,869
<i>- Yeah!
- Whoo!</i>

443
00:36:27,480 --> 00:36:29,471
You hear that? You hear that?

444
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:34,551
Look at this guy.

445
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,870
<i>Oh, c'est magnffique.</i>

446
00:37:28,520 --> 00:37:30,750
Oh, it's so fucking beautiful, man!

447
00:38:02,040 --> 00:38:04,793
- Neighbours!
- Hey! I've got your oils, man.

448
00:38:07,040 --> 00:38:09,031
I want to give you something.

449
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,556
<i>Listen up, everybody.</i>

450
00:38:12,640 --> 00:38:14,437
OK.

451
00:38:14,520 --> 00:38:17,956
Tomorrow, I will travel
for many miles on a bicycle.

452
00:38:18,920 --> 00:38:19,909
Um...

453
00:38:20,000 --> 00:38:20,989
Vicki.

454
00:38:21,080 --> 00:38:22,911
Uh... Uh...

455
00:38:23,000 --> 00:38:25,195
<i>Uh... Sutra cu putovati...</i>

456
00:38:25,280 --> 00:38:27,157
<i>...mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

457
00:38:27,240 --> 00:38:29,595
Great! Very good. Hélène?

458
00:38:29,680 --> 00:38:31,671
Very good!

459
00:38:31,760 --> 00:38:36,311
<i>Sutra cu putovati... mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

460
00:38:36,400 --> 00:38:37,674
<i>Very good.</i>

461
00:38:38,680 --> 00:38:40,750
Right. It's far too easy, though.

462
00:38:40,840 --> 00:38:43,877
<i>- Oh, please!
- Yes! OK.</i>

463
00:38:44,400 --> 00:38:48,313
<i>Sutra cu putovati mnogo
milja biciklom. Da posetim svoju tatu...</i>

464
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:53,520
<i>...koji cuva koze na planini.
There's more, ya know!</i>

465
00:38:53,600 --> 00:38:56,637
<i>- You always know everything!
- Richard!</i>

466
00:38:59,840 --> 00:39:01,319
<i>Sutra...</i>

467
00:39:01,400 --> 00:39:02,879
<i>...cu...</i>

468
00:39:02,960 --> 00:39:04,359
<i>...putovati...</i>

469
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,431
<i>...mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

470
00:39:06,520 --> 00:39:07,873
<i>Yes! Richard!</i>

471
00:39:07,960 --> 00:39:09,791
Represented, man!

472
00:39:09,880 --> 00:39:13,270
<i>Sutra cu putovati
mnogo milja biciklom.</i>

473
00:39:14,240 --> 00:39:15,719
<i>This became our world.</i>

474
00:39:16,640 --> 00:39:18,870
<i>And these people, our family.</i>

475
00:39:20,360 --> 00:39:23,796
<i>Back home was just one more place
we didn't think about.</i>

476
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,038
<i>I settled in.</i>

477
00:39:26,120 --> 00:39:27,917
<i>I found my vocation:</i>

478
00:39:28,000 --> 00:39:29,991
<i>...the pursuit...</i>

479
00:39:30,080 --> 00:39:31,593
<i>...of pleasure.</i>

480
00:39:45,280 --> 00:39:47,271
<i>Sal was the leader.</i>

481
00:39:47,360 --> 00:39:51,319
<i>But it wasn't a big deal. I mean,
there wasn't any ideology or shit like that.</i>

482
00:39:51,400 --> 00:39:55,313
<i>It was just a beach resort...
for people who don't like beach resorts.</i>

483
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:56,913
<i>...some of us build.</i>

484
00:39:57,000 --> 00:39:59,958
Even paradise takes a little shaping.

485
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:06,036
<i>For years, they kept this place a secret.</i>

486
00:40:06,120 --> 00:40:10,318
<i>They didn't need to tell anyone.
They were practically self-sufficient.</i>

487
00:40:10,400 --> 00:40:16,350
<i>They just had to sail back once in a while
to trade a little marijuana and buy some rice.</i>

488
00:40:18,640 --> 00:40:22,269
We grow our own, so no stealing
from the farmers on the other side.

489
00:40:22,360 --> 00:40:24,669
And do they know that you're living here?

490
00:40:24,760 --> 00:40:29,038
Oh, yeah. But they keep to their side
and we don't trespass on their turf.

491
00:40:29,120 --> 00:40:33,875
A couple of years ago, they said that we
could stay, but nobody else should come.

492
00:40:33,960 --> 00:40:36,952
- Which kind of suits us as well.
- So you was lucky, ya know.

493
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:38,439
Very lucky.

494
00:40:38,520 --> 00:40:41,159
<i>There was Keaty, who only cared
about two things.</i>

495
00:40:41,240 --> 00:40:43,231
Thank you, Lord...

496
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:46,073
<i>...for the twin pillars of civilisation:</i>

497
00:40:47,000 --> 00:40:48,433
...Christianity...

498
00:40:48,520 --> 00:40:51,159
<i>...and cricket.</i>

499
00:40:54,320 --> 00:40:55,753
<i>There were the Swedes:</i>

500
00:40:55,840 --> 00:40:57,831
<i>...Christo, Sten and Karl.</i>

501
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:59,911
We like fishing.

502
00:41:01,680 --> 00:41:04,274
- And in the winter, we like skiing.
- Yeah!

503
00:41:05,840 --> 00:41:08,400
Of course, in Thailand, there is no skiing.

504
00:41:08,480 --> 00:41:10,869
<i>We wait, OK?</i>

505
00:41:10,960 --> 00:41:13,155
We wait for the fish to come.

506
00:41:17,520 --> 00:41:18,873
Get it?

507
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,679
<i>- Shit! No way!
- Whoo!</i>

508
00:41:21,760 --> 00:41:24,832
And I said to thee "I shall provide!"

509
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:26,558
Yeah!

510
00:41:29,760 --> 00:41:31,512
- Stop it.
- What?

511
00:41:36,280 --> 00:41:38,953
<i>Our resident chef was known as Unhygenix.</i>

512
00:41:39,040 --> 00:41:40,553
Let's cook!

513
00:41:40,640 --> 00:41:42,790
<i>On account of his obsession with soap.</i>

514
00:41:42,880 --> 00:41:44,871
Fish, fish, fish!

515
00:41:49,480 --> 00:41:51,471
Still I smell of fish!

516
00:41:51,560 --> 00:41:56,236
<i>There was a range of sporting
and leisure activities to suit all tastes.</i>

517
00:41:56,320 --> 00:41:58,311
Étienne is good at soccer.

518
00:41:58,400 --> 00:42:01,233
Ya know, I could do that if I wanted to.

519
00:42:01,320 --> 00:42:04,073
- I just don't want to.
- What are you talking about?

520
00:42:05,120 --> 00:42:08,396
- Making conversation.
- Do you have a girlfriend?

521
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:11,031
- Here?
- Anywhere.

522
00:42:12,400 --> 00:42:14,755
No. Why?

523
00:42:15,520 --> 00:42:17,636
Just making conversation.

524
00:42:18,920 --> 00:42:20,911
<i>Whoo!</i>

525
00:42:23,360 --> 00:42:28,878
Right arm over wicket. Three balls remaining.
Is there anyone who still doesn't understand?

526
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:42,189
<i>The only person I didn't like was Sal's
boyfriend, Bugs - our on- island carpenter.</i>

527
00:42:42,280 --> 00:42:44,271
Hey, Richard! Can you do this?

528
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,236
Can you make anything?

529
00:42:49,000 --> 00:42:51,389
A man should have a talent in his hands.

530
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:54,630
<i>Here we go, people!</i>

531
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,438
Surprise!

532
00:42:56,520 --> 00:42:59,159
<i>So every community has its rituals.</i>

533
00:42:59,240 --> 00:43:03,438
<i>Well, ours was simple:
The last one to arrive tattoos the next.</i>

534
00:43:03,520 --> 00:43:05,511
It fuckin' hurts, OK?

535
00:43:05,600 --> 00:43:08,068
<i>What did he say?</i>

536
00:43:10,720 --> 00:43:11,755
Agh!

537
00:43:14,000 --> 00:43:16,275
Andy, bring yours closer.

538
00:43:16,360 --> 00:43:18,351
<i>Come on, Richard!</i>

539
00:43:23,360 --> 00:43:25,476
Ohhhh, God!

540
00:43:27,200 --> 00:43:29,475
Ohh, God!

541
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,991
Ohh, Jesus!

542
00:43:32,680 --> 00:43:35,672
<i>That fuckin' hurt!</i>

543
00:43:39,120 --> 00:43:41,953
<i>All in all, this really was paradise.</i>

544
00:43:42,040 --> 00:43:44,031
<i>Except for one thing.</i>

545
00:43:45,040 --> 00:43:47,031
<i>Desire is desire...</i>

546
00:43:47,120 --> 00:43:48,997
<i>...wherever you go.</i>

547
00:43:49,080 --> 00:43:51,071
<i>The sun will not bleach it...</i>

548
00:43:51,160 --> 00:43:53,549
<i>...nor the tide wash it away.</i>

549
00:43:55,120 --> 00:43:57,111
Françoise.

550
00:44:30,680 --> 00:44:32,636
One: She's just teasin' ya.

551
00:44:32,720 --> 00:44:35,109
<i>What are you talking about?</i>

552
00:44:35,200 --> 00:44:37,156
Two: You don't speak French.

553
00:44:37,240 --> 00:44:39,231
Three: He speaks French.

554
00:44:39,320 --> 00:44:41,629
In fact, even better than that, four:

555
00:44:41,720 --> 00:44:43,711
<i>...he is French.</i>

556
00:44:44,320 --> 00:44:48,711
Five: He's much better at football -
sorry, soccer - than you.

557
00:44:49,400 --> 00:44:51,960
And six: You're a bit strange, Rich.

558
00:44:52,040 --> 00:44:55,749
Some girls like that in a man, but not
the sort of girls you wanna be with.

559
00:44:55,840 --> 00:44:59,276
- Is that right?
- Come on, your last girlfriend chucked ya.

560
00:44:59,360 --> 00:45:02,477
- It was not my fault!
- And seven: Look at your thumbs, man!

561
00:45:02,560 --> 00:45:05,233
- They're well-defined.
- What does that mean?

562
00:45:05,320 --> 00:45:07,311
You play a lot of video games!

563
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,953
That is a powerful index of incompatibility.

564
00:45:11,520 --> 00:45:14,751
Why do I get the feeling
you're trying to tell me something?

565
00:45:14,840 --> 00:45:18,196
You haven't a hope - not a bleedin'
chicken's chance in Thailand.

566
00:45:18,280 --> 00:45:20,589
- Know what I mean?
- Thank you.

567
00:45:21,400 --> 00:45:24,073
So, enjoy the beach and cut the bullshit.

568
00:45:24,160 --> 00:45:27,277
<i>- Thank you very much.
- It's my pleasure!</i>

569
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,391
<i>No, you cannot... No!</i>

570
00:45:30,480 --> 00:45:32,835
No! No, leave me!

571
00:45:32,920 --> 00:45:34,831
<i>- Leave me!
- Hey! That's my bed!</i>

572
00:45:34,920 --> 00:45:37,798
- I can deal with it!
- I don't want you to deal with it!

573
00:45:37,880 --> 00:45:39,757
<i>It won't take a minute.</i>

574
00:45:39,840 --> 00:45:42,638
Really, no! No, I must go to mainland!

575
00:45:43,360 --> 00:45:46,318
I'm sick. I've got to. Sal!

576
00:45:46,400 --> 00:45:49,915
What's this? You want to go
to the mainland to see a dentist?

577
00:45:50,000 --> 00:45:52,673
- Yes.
- It's out of the question.

578
00:45:54,720 --> 00:45:56,711
Come on!

579
00:45:56,800 --> 00:45:58,791
Lt'll be fun.

580
00:45:58,880 --> 00:46:00,359
<i>Be brave.</i>

581
00:46:00,440 --> 00:46:02,431
<i>How's it going, Richard?</i>

582
00:46:03,440 --> 00:46:05,112
Fine. Fine.

583
00:46:05,200 --> 00:46:07,555
- Are you OK with this?
- Yeah.

584
00:46:08,760 --> 00:46:10,990
I mean, we have a secret here, right?

585
00:46:11,080 --> 00:46:14,595
Sometimes people need to
take a little pain to keep it that way.

586
00:46:15,600 --> 00:46:17,158
Excellent.

587
00:46:17,240 --> 00:46:19,231
Excellent attitude.

588
00:46:19,320 --> 00:46:21,754
No problem.

589
00:46:21,840 --> 00:46:24,593
<i>Oh, shit!</i>

590
00:46:28,160 --> 00:46:31,550
<i>Good work!</i>

591
00:46:31,640 --> 00:46:34,393
<i>Kill the pain, boy.</i>

592
00:46:39,400 --> 00:46:41,630
Take a drink.

593
00:46:53,400 --> 00:46:55,391
<i>Richard.</i>

594
00:46:55,480 --> 00:46:56,799
Yeah?

595
00:46:56,880 --> 00:46:59,155
Would you like to come
to the beach with me?

596
00:47:04,840 --> 00:47:06,432
Sure. Yeah.

597
00:47:17,320 --> 00:47:19,311
Are you happy, Richard?

598
00:47:19,880 --> 00:47:21,711
Happy?

599
00:47:21,800 --> 00:47:22,869
Yeah.

600
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,951
Yeah... Yeah, I-I guess.

601
00:47:25,040 --> 00:47:27,600
I mean, the beach, ya know, it's just perfect.

602
00:47:27,680 --> 00:47:29,671
Do you think that I ignore you?

603
00:47:33,080 --> 00:47:34,433
No.

604
00:47:34,520 --> 00:47:36,317
But I do.

605
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:41,110
It's because I'm with Étienne.
It's difficult for me to spend time with you.

606
00:47:47,840 --> 00:47:52,231
I don't suppose that there's any...
you know, special reason that you should.

607
00:47:54,080 --> 00:47:56,958
- Spend time with me, that is.
- Of course there is.

608
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:58,553
I like you.

609
00:47:58,640 --> 00:48:00,039
A lot.

610
00:48:00,120 --> 00:48:02,839
Have you... Have you
told this to Étienne? Or...

611
00:48:02,920 --> 00:48:03,909
No.

612
00:48:04,000 --> 00:48:06,195
It's our secret.

613
00:48:07,200 --> 00:48:08,349
OK.

614
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,357
Look! There! The plankfon. Shrimps.

615
00:48:12,440 --> 00:48:14,476
When they're disturbed, they glow.

616
00:48:14,560 --> 00:48:16,551
Come on!

617
00:48:17,200 --> 00:48:21,398
<i># I'm coming, not drowning
Swimming closer to you</i>

618
00:48:58,520 --> 00:49:00,158
<i># I'm moving</i>

619
00:49:00,240 --> 00:49:02,231
<i># I feel it</i>

620
00:49:03,560 --> 00:49:05,551
<i># I'm coming, not drowning</i>

621
00:49:08,200 --> 00:49:10,191
<i># I'm moving, I feel it</i>

622
00:49:12,480 --> 00:49:15,711
<i># I'm coming, not drowning</i>

623
00:49:16,600 --> 00:49:18,591
<i># I'm moving, I'm coming</i>

624
00:49:18,680 --> 00:49:20,671
<i># Can you hear what I hear?</i>

625
00:49:20,760 --> 00:49:22,751
<i># It's calling you, my dear...</i>

626
00:49:22,840 --> 00:49:26,799
<i>That night, we promised ourselves,
and we honestly believed...</i>

627
00:49:26,880 --> 00:49:28,871
<i>...that no one would ever know.</i>

628
00:49:31,000 --> 00:49:33,673
- I wanna talk.
- About what?

629
00:49:34,320 --> 00:49:36,311
About you and Françoise.

630
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:39,551
Whaddaya mean... me and Françoise?

631
00:49:42,280 --> 00:49:44,271
I mean, Richard...

632
00:49:45,440 --> 00:49:47,715
- ... that I want her to be happy.
- Yeah.

633
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,791
I mean, of course.

634
00:49:49,880 --> 00:49:52,075
- We all do, right?
- Shut up!

635
00:49:53,160 --> 00:49:55,230
Please shut the fuck up.

636
00:50:00,120 --> 00:50:02,111
And if happy is with you...

637
00:50:02,200 --> 00:50:04,760
<i>...then I will not stand in her way.</i>

638
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,511
Étienne, man, I...

639
00:50:09,600 --> 00:50:13,991
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- Fuck you, Richard! I know!

640
00:50:14,080 --> 00:50:15,991
OK? I know!

641
00:50:16,080 --> 00:50:18,036
Everybody knows!

642
00:50:28,800 --> 00:50:31,394
<i>The problem is seeing the fish.</i>

643
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,435
With the heavy rain and the bad light...

644
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,114
<i>...it's very difficult to catch them.</i>

645
00:50:37,200 --> 00:50:39,589
It can last for days.

646
00:50:40,280 --> 00:50:42,236
Sometimes...

647
00:50:42,320 --> 00:50:44,311
<i>...we get really hungry.</i>

648
00:50:52,040 --> 00:50:53,917
Gimme that.

649
00:50:56,280 --> 00:50:57,998
Richard!

650
00:51:21,720 --> 00:51:23,711
Richard! Richard!

651
00:51:24,360 --> 00:51:26,476
Come out!

652
00:51:27,720 --> 00:51:29,711
I can't hear you!

653
00:51:34,600 --> 00:51:36,795
And you can't hear me.

654
00:51:38,320 --> 00:51:40,754
- Shark!
- Come!

655
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:02,830
Shark!

656
00:52:08,720 --> 00:52:11,075
Ohh!

657
00:52:15,840 --> 00:52:18,434
<i>All right, all right.</i>

658
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,511
All right, all right, all right!

659
00:52:21,960 --> 00:52:23,154
Shh!

660
00:52:24,600 --> 00:52:28,593
Now before I start, there's just
a couple of things you have to remember.

661
00:52:30,320 --> 00:52:32,550
Number one: You have to remain calm.

662
00:52:32,640 --> 00:52:34,631
Right?

663
00:52:35,720 --> 00:52:38,837
And number two: You have to show no fear.

664
00:52:38,920 --> 00:52:41,434
- Teach it, teach it.
- Because the sharks...

665
00:52:41,520 --> 00:52:44,353
You see, the sharks, they can sense that fear.

666
00:52:45,120 --> 00:52:47,509
Just as easily as they can sense blood.

667
00:52:48,880 --> 00:52:50,871
<i>And so it went for me.</i>

668
00:52:50,960 --> 00:52:52,951
<i>Just as I knew it would.</i>

669
00:52:53,040 --> 00:52:55,031
Just as nature had ordained.

670
00:52:55,120 --> 00:52:57,554
Its... jaw wide open.

671
00:52:58,560 --> 00:53:04,829
Row upon row of these razor-sharp teeth
glinting underwater like... jagged diamonds.

672
00:53:04,920 --> 00:53:08,993
It's tail fin sweeping back and forth
as it surged in for the kill.

673
00:53:10,240 --> 00:53:11,639
<i>I swear to God...</i>

674
00:53:11,720 --> 00:53:14,154
<i>...my whole llfe
flashed before my eyes.</i>

675
00:53:15,840 --> 00:53:17,432
<i>Really.</i>

676
00:53:17,520 --> 00:53:20,273
I had nothing left to offer
except for pure reflex.

677
00:53:20,360 --> 00:53:21,873
<i>Pure reflex...</i>

678
00:53:21,960 --> 00:53:25,873
<i>...and mankind's basic drive for survival
that somehow...</i>

679
00:53:25,960 --> 00:53:29,839
...shouts "No! I will not die today!"

680
00:53:29,920 --> 00:53:32,434
- Yes!
- Whoo!

681
00:53:34,240 --> 00:53:37,198
<i>At that instant, I knew
it was either the shark or me.</i>

682
00:53:37,280 --> 00:53:39,430
<i>The shark knew it.</i>

683
00:53:39,520 --> 00:53:41,511
<i>I knew it.</i>

684
00:53:42,920 --> 00:53:44,638
But jeez... God!

685
00:53:44,720 --> 00:53:49,111
It's nothin' personal, right? It's just
the way the world works. It's nature.

686
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:53,990
<i>But... If I remember correctly...</i>

687
00:53:56,520 --> 00:53:58,909
<i>...in that last glimmer of its eyes...</i>

688
00:54:01,320 --> 00:54:03,436
...there was a moment between us...

689
00:54:07,280 --> 00:54:09,589
...where it said "Hey, Richard, man. "

690
00:54:10,760 --> 00:54:12,239
<i>"Enjoy your dinner. "</i>

691
00:54:25,520 --> 00:54:28,910
Strange thing, killing a shark,
isn't it, Richard?

692
00:54:31,640 --> 00:54:33,631
It's just a big fish, Bugs.

693
00:54:33,720 --> 00:54:35,631
Just a big fish?

694
00:54:35,720 --> 00:54:40,350
Yeah, maybe! Maybe when it's just a baby
and it hasn't really learned to kill yet.

695
00:54:40,440 --> 00:54:42,431
Then maybe it's just a big fish.

696
00:54:43,200 --> 00:54:47,352
But when it's a great white angry mother
with the taste of blood on its tongue...

697
00:54:47,440 --> 00:54:49,510
<i>...now that's a different story.</i>

698
00:54:57,480 --> 00:54:59,550
<i>Oh, God! Jeez...</i>

699
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,631
I'm sorry, Bugs. Is itjust me?

700
00:55:01,720 --> 00:55:04,439
Or does this wet weather
make everyone so damn tired?

701
00:55:04,520 --> 00:55:08,593
Maybe we can hear your very different
and, I'm sure, very interesting story...

702
00:55:08,680 --> 00:55:11,478
<i>...some other time, huh?</i>

703
00:55:14,120 --> 00:55:16,270
Very interesting, Keaty!

704
00:55:16,360 --> 00:55:19,158
<i>Vrlo interesantno.</i>

705
00:55:23,640 --> 00:55:26,438
<i>Molto interessante!</i>

706
00:55:26,520 --> 00:55:29,830
<i>- Good night, young lovers.
- Shut up!</i>

707
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:33,595
<i>For a while, we were untouchable
in our happiness.</i>

708
00:55:37,320 --> 00:55:39,311
All right! Everybody!

709
00:55:39,400 --> 00:55:42,278
<i>Quiet!</i>

710
00:55:42,360 --> 00:55:46,876
We have a situation. It's not a disaster.
But as some of you may have heard...

711
00:55:46,960 --> 00:55:50,999
<i>...a couple of sacks of rice have
become contaminated by a fungus.</i>

712
00:55:51,080 --> 00:55:53,310
- Yeah.
- It's cos we keep it in that shack.

713
00:55:53,400 --> 00:55:55,994
- How many more times must this happen?
- Rice run!
