1
00:00:11,365 --> 00:00:14,448
-  Where are we gonna find it?

2
00:00:20,581 --> 00:00:23,411
-  Jacob, what did you do?

3
00:00:23,411 --> 00:00:24,401
- What?

4
00:00:24,401 --> 00:00:26,041
-  Did you mean to hurt it?

5
00:00:26,041 --> 00:00:26,874
- What?

6
00:00:26,874 --> 00:00:27,951
- Did you hurt it on purpose?

7
00:00:27,951 --> 00:00:29,114
- What's "on purpose"?

8
00:00:30,492 --> 00:00:32,591
-  Did you mean to kill it

9
00:00:32,591 --> 00:00:34,241
or was it an accident, sweetheart?

10
00:00:34,241 --> 00:00:35,491
Daddy and I want to know.

11
00:00:37,541 --> 00:00:38,374
Look at me.

12
00:00:40,801 --> 00:00:41,634
Jacob.

13
00:00:44,461 --> 00:00:45,971
Just turn the camera off.

14
00:00:45,971 --> 00:00:46,968
Just turn it off.

15
00:01:07,419 --> 00:01:10,919
- This is the kind of shit I come home to.

16
00:01:15,231 --> 00:01:16,214
Seven pairs.

17
00:01:22,901 --> 00:01:24,074
Seven pairs.

18
00:01:29,551 --> 00:01:30,554
Sounds bother him.

19
00:01:32,941 --> 00:01:34,244
Certain sounds, anyway.

20
00:01:37,851 --> 00:01:39,424
Like high heels on linoleum.

21
00:01:44,901 --> 00:01:45,951
Yeah, well...

22
00:01:47,461 --> 00:01:49,561
I'm keeping track of this shit now, Jacob.

23
00:01:51,551 --> 00:01:52,401
I'm recording it.

24
00:02:00,139 --> 00:02:04,472
- I hate you, mom!

25
00:02:07,398 --> 00:02:08,384
- You hear that?

26
00:02:09,771 --> 00:02:10,831
That's Jacob blowing a fit

27
00:02:10,831 --> 00:02:13,320
because I told him he had to reimburse me.

28
00:02:15,515 --> 00:02:16,941
You wanna monster out, that's fine.

29
00:02:16,941 --> 00:02:18,401
Monster out.

30
00:02:18,401 --> 00:02:20,085
-  Leave me alone.

31
00:02:20,085 --> 00:02:22,574
Fucking psycho.

32
00:02:22,574 --> 00:02:25,281
- Yeah, I'm a fucking psycho.

33
00:02:25,281 --> 00:02:26,921
'Cause I told him, until he reimburses me,

34
00:02:26,921 --> 00:02:28,706
he's not getting his PlayStation back.

35
00:02:30,571 --> 00:02:31,794
I'm recording this!

36
00:02:41,611 --> 00:02:42,631
Jacob.

37
00:02:42,631 --> 00:02:44,101
It was seven pairs.

38
00:02:44,101 --> 00:02:47,141
-  I didn't
touch your stupid shoes.

39
00:02:47,141 --> 00:02:48,091
- What?

40
00:02:48,091 --> 00:02:51,091
- I didn't
touch your stupid shoes.

41
00:02:51,091 --> 00:02:51,924
- Very funny.

42
00:02:55,171 --> 00:02:56,004
What did you throw?

43
00:02:56,004 --> 00:02:57,601
What smashed?

44
00:02:57,601 --> 00:02:58,434
- Nothing.

45
00:03:00,181 --> 00:03:01,674
You're the one "monstering out", okay?

46
00:03:01,674 --> 00:03:03,651
Just take a bath or something...

47
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:18,331
Welcome to the worst town in America;

48
00:03:18,331 --> 00:03:19,621
Parma, Ohio.
- Hey.

49
00:03:20,861 --> 00:03:25,101
I am here interviewing the
aloof new boy of the school,

50
00:03:25,101 --> 00:03:27,534
Jacob Bell, everyone!

51
00:03:28,411 --> 00:03:29,591
Save "hi", Jacob.

52
00:03:29,591 --> 00:03:30,694
Stop it!

53
00:03:37,311 --> 00:03:38,504
- My name is Abbey.

54
00:03:39,441 --> 00:03:42,421
I live in Parma, Ohio--

55
00:03:42,421 --> 00:03:43,991
Oh shit!

56
00:03:43,991 --> 00:03:45,134
I'm thirty.

57
00:03:46,821 --> 00:03:48,632
Well, mid 30s.

58
00:03:48,632 --> 00:03:49,884
Mid to late 30s.

59
00:03:50,931 --> 00:03:51,871
Not 40...

60
00:03:52,794 --> 00:03:54,214
Definitely not 40.

61
00:04:03,351 --> 00:04:04,444
My name is Abbey.

62
00:04:05,801 --> 00:04:07,024
I'm 42 years old.

63
00:04:09,041 --> 00:04:10,044
I'm a single mom.

64
00:04:11,591 --> 00:04:16,021
My son, Jacob, he just
turned 16, which is...

65
00:04:17,188 --> 00:04:19,714
Well, that's a handful
for any kind of mom.

66
00:04:22,771 --> 00:04:23,821
The thing is...

67
00:04:26,031 --> 00:04:27,151
Jacob is...

68
00:04:30,811 --> 00:04:32,301
I think he is, anyway...

69
00:04:37,681 --> 00:04:39,111
I think he's going to...

70
00:04:45,135 --> 00:04:46,385
This is stupid.

71
00:04:49,521 --> 00:04:50,831
-  Dude, we gotta get outta here.

72
00:04:50,831 --> 00:04:52,331
We're gonna get arrested, bro.

73
00:04:56,001 --> 00:04:56,951
What are you doing?

74
00:04:59,481 --> 00:05:00,594
- Natural selection.

75
00:05:01,891 --> 00:05:03,601
-  Oh, don't even
play like that, bro.

76
00:05:03,601 --> 00:05:06,316
You're gonna cause a fucking
accident or something.

77
00:05:06,316 --> 00:05:07,181
Oh fuck!

78
00:05:07,181 --> 00:05:08,813
Shit!

79
00:05:08,813 --> 00:05:10,846
Get the fuck out of here, bro!

80
00:05:10,846 --> 00:05:12,179
Dude go, go, go!

81
00:05:20,542 --> 00:05:21,792
- Look at this.

82
00:05:25,381 --> 00:05:27,844
If this was just for
his geometry assignment,

83
00:05:31,821 --> 00:05:33,414
why would he draw himself, huh?

84
00:05:37,338 --> 00:05:39,644
"To demonstrate scale" my ass.

85
00:05:42,615 --> 00:05:43,765
And here, look at this.

86
00:05:48,781 --> 00:05:51,181
Why would a 14 year old
boy even have this, huh?

87
00:05:57,952 --> 00:05:59,881
What kind of kid wants
to turn his pellet gun

88
00:05:59,881 --> 00:06:01,144
into an automatic weapon?

89
00:06:04,181 --> 00:06:06,541
Bump stocks were not invented
for fucking air guns,

90
00:06:06,541 --> 00:06:07,531
I'll tell you that.

91
00:06:12,631 --> 00:06:13,891
I'm sorry, I just...

92
00:06:15,861 --> 00:06:18,011
I don't understand why there
aren't more resources out there

93
00:06:18,011 --> 00:06:19,851
to deal with this kind of thing.

94
00:06:19,851 --> 00:06:21,314
I reported him two years ago.

95
00:06:22,441 --> 00:06:24,151
And yeah, they launched an investigation,

96
00:06:24,151 --> 00:06:26,458
put Jacob under surveillance.

97
00:06:26,458 --> 00:06:28,186
"Your son provided a rational explanation

98
00:06:28,186 --> 00:06:29,878
"for every offense."

99
00:06:31,201 --> 00:06:32,301
That's what they said.

100
00:06:33,398 --> 00:06:34,938
"Rational explanation."

101
00:06:36,321 --> 00:06:37,371
Now I'm the bad guy

102
00:06:37,371 --> 00:06:39,801
'cause Jacob served time
in a diversion program

103
00:06:42,529 --> 00:06:43,479
and we had to move.

104
00:06:45,769 --> 00:06:46,602
Again.

105
00:06:49,914 --> 00:06:51,181
He's already in therapy,

106
00:06:51,181 --> 00:06:53,268
so couldn't blame me for that one.

107
00:07:00,511 --> 00:07:02,431
My mom spent a shit ton in legal fees

108
00:07:02,431 --> 00:07:04,064
to get all this stuff back, too.

109
00:07:04,991 --> 00:07:07,014
God forbid it goes on his record.

110
00:07:07,951 --> 00:07:08,826
She's like,

111
00:07:08,826 --> 00:07:09,961
"You don't wanna be the boy
who cried 'wolf', do you?"

112
00:07:09,961 --> 00:07:10,924
I'm like, "No, mom.

113
00:07:11,998 --> 00:07:12,838
"I don't."

114
00:07:15,351 --> 00:07:18,681
By the way, the boy who cried wolf

115
00:07:21,001 --> 00:07:22,464
got eaten by the fuckin' wolf.

116
00:07:29,601 --> 00:07:31,571
- We were talking about how
to get more bang for your buck

117
00:07:31,571 --> 00:07:33,421
out of everyone's favorite AR-15.

118
00:07:33,421 --> 00:07:34,951
And with you guys shooting the .223s

119
00:07:34,951 --> 00:07:37,947
or the 5.56s, everyone knows--

120
00:07:41,891 --> 00:07:44,774
-  Sleeping Jacob
is my favorite Jacob.

121
00:07:46,261 --> 00:07:50,461
He had almost a two hour tantrum.

122
00:07:50,461 --> 00:07:51,964
Worked himself into a fit.

123
00:07:53,431 --> 00:07:54,544
Now he's sleeping.

124
00:07:55,771 --> 00:07:57,757
Honey, I don't think
you can climb on that!

125
00:07:57,757 --> 00:07:59,821
-  There are all those
babies living in there.

126
00:07:59,821 --> 00:08:00,654
-  That's somebody's--

127
00:08:00,654 --> 00:08:01,880
That's a birdhouse.

128
00:08:01,880 --> 00:08:02,713
No, no!

129
00:08:02,713 --> 00:08:04,125
Babies, no!

130
00:08:04,125 --> 00:08:05,984
-  There are baby birds in there.

131
00:08:05,984 --> 00:08:07,817
-  Let go, now!

132
00:08:08,975 --> 00:08:09,998
- What?

133
00:08:09,998 --> 00:08:11,415
-  Let go.

134
00:08:12,251 --> 00:08:14,991
-  That's why that bird
is swooping at your head.

135
00:08:14,991 --> 00:08:16,180
-  They're very upset.

136
00:08:16,180 --> 00:08:17,551
-  Walk away!

137
00:08:27,931 --> 00:08:29,784
- You know that's illegal, right?

138
00:08:30,821 --> 00:08:32,691
-  The light's red.

139
00:08:32,691 --> 00:08:34,291
- What are you recording me for?

140
00:08:35,559 --> 00:08:36,392
-  I want to capture

141
00:08:36,392 --> 00:08:38,091
that miraculous transformation you make.

142
00:08:39,001 --> 00:08:40,291
When you're alone in the car with mom

143
00:08:40,291 --> 00:08:42,291
to when you're not alone
in the car with mom.

144
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:44,301
- For what; for who?

145
00:08:50,401 --> 00:08:53,431
Hey, Detective Kelly, remember me?

146
00:08:53,431 --> 00:08:55,371
Mom's freaking out again.

147
00:08:55,371 --> 00:08:56,431
- Knock it off.

148
00:08:56,431 --> 00:08:58,189
- She came home totally hammered

149
00:08:58,189 --> 00:09:01,751
and she cut up all her shoes.

150
00:09:01,751 --> 00:09:03,631
She's probably gonna say I did it,

151
00:09:03,631 --> 00:09:04,831
but just for the record.

152
00:09:05,751 --> 00:09:06,584
Later.

153
00:09:07,901 --> 00:09:08,734
-  You're disgusting.

154
00:09:08,734 --> 00:09:10,454
Look me in the eye and say that again.

155
00:09:11,891 --> 00:09:13,561
- You were drunk.

156
00:09:13,561 --> 00:09:15,281
You cut up your shoes.

157
00:09:15,281 --> 00:09:16,114
Again.

158
00:09:18,511 --> 00:09:19,994
Fucking go already.

159
00:09:23,931 --> 00:09:26,341
- Well, he knows I'm recording, so.

160
00:09:26,341 --> 00:09:28,541
Technically, he's still
in the car with mom.

161
00:09:29,921 --> 00:09:32,684
This may be the "other Jacob" emerging.

162
00:09:34,171 --> 00:09:35,324
The fake Jacob.

163
00:09:37,418 --> 00:09:42,131
The thing is, he doesn't
fit the profile of a...

164
00:09:43,111 --> 00:09:46,831
I mean he has friends
and gets good grades.

165
00:09:46,831 --> 00:09:48,014
His teachers like him.

166
00:09:49,361 --> 00:09:51,381
Except from that one
jerky science teacher,

167
00:09:51,381 --> 00:09:53,024
everyone loves the fake Jacob.

168
00:09:56,741 --> 00:10:00,064
To be honest, every time
they tell me I'm wrong,

169
00:10:01,172 --> 00:10:02,791
that I'm exaggerating his symptoms,

170
00:10:02,791 --> 00:10:05,994
I feel this enormous sense of relief.

171
00:10:07,301 --> 00:10:09,984
I mean, what if it is me?

172
00:10:11,632 --> 00:10:13,044
What if Jacob is okay?

173
00:10:16,108 --> 00:10:18,674
"Psychosomatic projection",
I think they call it.

174
00:10:19,801 --> 00:10:21,911
It's when you experience
this trauma as a kid,

175
00:10:21,911 --> 00:10:24,711
this extreme fucking trauma

176
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:28,421
and you project that on your husband,

177
00:10:28,421 --> 00:10:30,224
your kid, your parents.

178
00:10:32,561 --> 00:10:34,361
Then I think, "What if it's not me?"

179
00:10:36,781 --> 00:10:38,044
What if it's genetic?

180
00:10:40,511 --> 00:10:44,011
Sometimes when I look in
his eyes I get this replay,

181
00:10:44,011 --> 00:10:46,744
this instant fucking replay of Jerry,

182
00:10:47,580 --> 00:10:50,828
and I imagine him in that
Mustang with his sawed off--

183
00:10:51,661 --> 00:10:52,811
-  Pickup
and drop-off only, ma'am.

184
00:10:52,811 --> 00:10:53,644
-  Thank you!

185
00:10:53,644 --> 00:10:54,477
Sorry.

186
00:10:55,951 --> 00:10:57,164
This is his room.

187
00:11:04,281 --> 00:11:05,751
When he's not at school,

188
00:11:05,751 --> 00:11:08,104
this is where he spends most of his time.

189
00:11:10,891 --> 00:11:11,984
All of his time.

190
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:16,821
This is Adolf.

191
00:11:16,821 --> 00:11:17,654
Hi!

192
00:11:18,551 --> 00:11:20,924
Last one died, so this is Adolf Junior.

193
00:11:21,889 --> 00:11:23,874
Or Adolf Junior Jr., maybe.

194
00:11:27,292 --> 00:11:28,244
As you can see,

195
00:11:30,036 --> 00:11:31,551
he plays a lot of video games.

196
00:11:31,551 --> 00:11:33,514
I think that's pretty normal.

197
00:11:34,659 --> 00:11:35,654
I mean,

198
00:11:37,791 --> 00:11:38,734
is that normal?

199
00:11:40,351 --> 00:11:42,301
Spend five, six hours a day?

200
00:11:42,301 --> 00:11:43,531
I don't know, just...

201
00:11:44,771 --> 00:11:45,784
Shooting people.

202
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:49,504
People say it's normal.

203
00:11:51,351 --> 00:11:52,184
People.

204
00:11:56,081 --> 00:11:59,094
What's not normal, is this.

205
00:12:05,501 --> 00:12:06,454
Are you kidding me?

206
00:12:06,454 --> 00:12:07,287
Jesus.

207
00:12:08,731 --> 00:12:10,781
- Talk American.

208
00:12:10,781 --> 00:12:13,085
-  Would you like
me better if I was British?

209
00:12:14,121 --> 00:12:14,954
- No.

210
00:12:17,031 --> 00:12:17,864
-  Hey, you've gotta help me

211
00:12:17,864 --> 00:12:18,944
with my science project.

212
00:12:20,278 --> 00:12:21,694
- It's so easy.

213
00:12:21,694 --> 00:12:23,944
-  It's
not easy for all of us.

214
00:12:25,275 --> 00:12:27,011
Aren't you supposed to be
really smart or something?

215
00:12:27,011 --> 00:12:27,961
What are you doing?

216
00:12:30,971 --> 00:12:32,234
You're such an asshole!

217
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:34,383
- Whatever.

218
00:12:34,383 --> 00:12:36,021
He's fucking old anyway.

219
00:12:36,021 --> 00:12:36,854
-  Why?

220
00:12:36,854 --> 00:12:38,361
You think we should just
kill off all old people?

221
00:12:38,361 --> 00:12:39,407
- Yes!

222
00:12:39,407 --> 00:12:40,862
That is a good idea!

223
00:12:40,862 --> 00:12:41,697
-  Oh Whatever.
-  See?

224
00:12:41,697 --> 00:12:44,261
You're already halfway done
with your science project.

225
00:12:44,261 --> 00:12:45,321
- Fucking jaw off...

226
00:12:46,241 --> 00:12:47,891
-  Say what you just said.

227
00:12:49,831 --> 00:12:50,664
I'm serious.

228
00:12:50,664 --> 00:12:51,811
Say what you just said.

229
00:12:51,811 --> 00:12:52,644
- Stop already.

230
00:12:54,161 --> 00:12:55,251
-  Knock it off.

231
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:56,261
- Chill, mom, seriously.

232
00:12:56,261 --> 00:12:57,094
-  Let go.

233
00:12:57,094 --> 00:12:57,927
Ow, you're hurting me.

234
00:12:57,927 --> 00:12:59,208
- I'm not even touching you.

235
00:13:00,751 --> 00:13:01,584
- Jacob!

236
00:13:08,811 --> 00:13:10,961
See, that's exactly
what I'm talking about.

237
00:13:18,631 --> 00:13:23,631
Okay, I got this when he was
around two of wetting the bed

238
00:13:25,641 --> 00:13:26,874
with his diapers on.

239
00:13:30,991 --> 00:13:33,841
I caught him taking them
off, pissing the bed,

240
00:13:33,841 --> 00:13:35,741
and putting his diapers back on again.

241
00:13:36,931 --> 00:13:38,344
Little creep.

242
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,274
Shit, where's the charging thingy?

243
00:13:46,511 --> 00:13:47,344
Testing.

244
00:13:55,531 --> 00:13:56,421
All right...

245
00:13:57,931 --> 00:14:01,464
Okay, so it's May 4th, 2018, by the way.

246
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,041
Jacob should be home any minute.

247
00:14:04,941 --> 00:14:07,351
If his PlayStation isn't back in his room,

248
00:14:07,351 --> 00:14:08,848
he's gonna rip my jaw off.

249
00:14:09,830 --> 00:14:10,663
That's what he said,

250
00:14:10,663 --> 00:14:12,408
"I'll rip your fucking jaw off."

251
00:14:15,461 --> 00:14:16,294
Look, I know.

252
00:14:16,294 --> 00:14:18,521
I know I'm not handling
this well; I know that.

253
00:14:19,531 --> 00:14:21,011
He can't keep breaking my shit.

254
00:14:21,011 --> 00:14:22,511
He's not a little kid anymore.

255
00:14:24,908 --> 00:14:27,201
I know, I know...

256
00:14:29,708 --> 00:14:30,644
I'm a mom.

257
00:14:33,921 --> 00:14:34,878
I'm a mom--

258
00:14:45,351 --> 00:14:46,184
Hey.

259
00:14:59,141 --> 00:14:59,974
- Mom...

260
00:15:01,591 --> 00:15:02,691
What the hell is this?

261
00:15:04,031 --> 00:15:06,271
- Sign it, and I will give
you your PlayStation back.

262
00:15:06,271 --> 00:15:07,471
- Are you fucking joking?

263
00:15:07,471 --> 00:15:08,668
- Lose the attitude, Jacob.

264
00:15:08,668 --> 00:15:11,631
You can pay me back a
little bit at a time.

265
00:15:21,481 --> 00:15:22,641
Why are you calling me?

266
00:15:22,641 --> 00:15:24,148
- Why do you think?

267
00:15:24,148 --> 00:15:25,681
- I'm not recording you.

268
00:15:25,681 --> 00:15:26,514
- Where is it?

269
00:15:36,221 --> 00:15:37,571
- It's not in there, Jacob.

270
00:15:39,236 --> 00:15:41,591
- Where the fuck is my PlayStation?

271
00:15:41,591 --> 00:15:43,081
I told you; I warned you!

272
00:15:43,081 --> 00:15:46,544
- And I told you if you sign
it, you will get it back.

273
00:15:52,361 --> 00:15:55,134
Jacob, don't do that.

274
00:15:58,091 --> 00:16:01,611
God, if you could just not
be a little shit for once...

275
00:16:01,611 --> 00:16:03,401
Okay, you know what?

276
00:16:03,401 --> 00:16:04,234
I'm out.

277
00:16:04,234 --> 00:16:05,481
I'm not doing this with you.

278
00:16:07,032 --> 00:16:08,248
Okay--

279
00:16:08,248 --> 00:16:09,228
Jacob!

280
00:16:09,228 --> 00:16:10,061
Stop it now!

281
00:16:10,894 --> 00:16:11,727
No!

282
00:17:27,736 --> 00:17:28,736
- I'm sorry.

283
00:17:34,794 --> 00:17:35,627
- I know.

284
00:18:04,991 --> 00:18:09,954
-  So, what was the
worst day of your life?

285
00:18:11,641 --> 00:18:12,661
- Jesus...

286
00:18:15,091 --> 00:18:17,444
Probably the day my stepmom moved in.

287
00:18:18,731 --> 00:18:19,564
-  Why?

288
00:18:21,051 --> 00:18:21,884
- I don't know.

289
00:18:21,884 --> 00:18:23,611
Because it just meant my
mom wasn't coming home

290
00:18:23,611 --> 00:18:26,504
and it made everything like really final.

291
00:18:29,941 --> 00:18:31,061
And she sucks.

292
00:18:31,061 --> 00:18:32,704
She's the worst.

293
00:18:34,881 --> 00:18:36,723
-  Want me to just kill her?

294
00:18:36,723 --> 00:18:39,751
- Yeah, Jacob, fantastic idea.

295
00:18:39,751 --> 00:18:40,584
Thank you.

296
00:18:43,001 --> 00:18:46,131
So, is it true you moved here

297
00:18:46,131 --> 00:18:48,271
because you got kicked out of Riverside?

298
00:18:48,271 --> 00:18:49,104
- Is that your question?

299
00:18:49,104 --> 00:18:50,301
-  Yeah.

300
00:18:50,301 --> 00:18:52,029
- You and everybody else.

301
00:18:52,029 --> 00:18:54,196
Ask me something original.

302
00:18:55,905 --> 00:18:57,641
-  Okay,

303
00:18:57,641 --> 00:18:59,794
what's with the long sleeves all the time?

304
00:19:00,941 --> 00:19:03,371
- What's with all the
fuckin' push-up bras?

305
00:19:03,371 --> 00:19:04,841
-  Whoa, it's truth or dare.

306
00:19:04,841 --> 00:19:06,051
You have to answer.

307
00:19:06,051 --> 00:19:06,884
C'mon--

308
00:19:06,884 --> 00:19:07,853
- Stop it.

309
00:19:07,853 --> 00:19:09,608
It's a stupid game.

310
00:19:09,608 --> 00:19:11,941
- Okay, and this is his Risperidone.

311
00:19:11,941 --> 00:19:14,601
It's kinda like an antidepressant.

312
00:19:14,601 --> 00:19:19,601
Well, actually it's an
antipsychotic but that's a bit much.

313
00:19:20,311 --> 00:19:22,061
He takes that with the Carbamazepine,

314
00:19:22,061 --> 00:19:23,545
which is for seizures.

315
00:19:23,545 --> 00:19:24,601
Well, that's wrong.

316
00:19:24,601 --> 00:19:27,301
I mean, it's not wrong, it's
just not why he takes it.

317
00:19:28,781 --> 00:19:33,741
Adderall, 15 milligrams
of this every morning.

318
00:19:33,741 --> 00:19:36,668
For his, y'know--

319
00:19:36,668 --> 00:19:38,154
His attention deficit.

320
00:19:39,251 --> 00:19:40,661
Can you hear me now?

321
00:19:40,661 --> 00:19:42,781
- I can hear you just fine.

322
00:19:42,781 --> 00:19:44,381
Your face just keeps freezing up.

323
00:19:44,381 --> 00:19:46,721
Why can't we just talk on the telephone?

324
00:19:46,721 --> 00:19:47,831
- You look fine, mom.

325
00:19:47,831 --> 00:19:49,134
- Yeah, look at my hair!

326
00:19:49,134 --> 00:19:51,311
Let me get some lipstick on.

327
00:19:51,311 --> 00:19:53,121
- Listen, mom, Jacob's gonna be home soon.

328
00:19:53,121 --> 00:19:53,954
Could you just--

329
00:19:53,954 --> 00:19:54,787
- I'm listening, honey.

330
00:19:54,787 --> 00:19:57,371
I'm just getting my lipstick thingy.

331
00:19:57,371 --> 00:19:59,601
- He's having the tantrums again.

332
00:19:59,601 --> 00:20:01,251
The other day, he pinned
me up against a wall

333
00:20:01,251 --> 00:20:02,861
and I couldn't get out
from underneath him.

334
00:20:02,861 --> 00:20:04,271
- Well why would you let him do that?

335
00:20:04,271 --> 00:20:06,644
Boys aren't supposed to
wrestle with their mothers.

336
00:20:06,644 --> 00:20:08,011
That's what fathers are for.

337
00:20:08,011 --> 00:20:08,844
- No, don't.

338
00:20:08,844 --> 00:20:10,188
Don't do that.

339
00:20:10,188 --> 00:20:11,021
- What?

340
00:20:11,021 --> 00:20:12,231
What'd I do?

341
00:20:12,231 --> 00:20:13,281
I didn't even say his name.

342
00:20:13,281 --> 00:20:14,391
- We weren't wrestling, mom.

343
00:20:14,391 --> 00:20:15,638
He was angry, okay?

344
00:20:15,638 --> 00:20:17,021
- Well he's a teenager.

345
00:20:17,021 --> 00:20:19,441
Teenagers are moody, especially boys.

346
00:20:19,441 --> 00:20:20,274
All those hormones.

347
00:20:20,274 --> 00:20:21,631
- No, this wasn't hormones, mom.

348
00:20:21,631 --> 00:20:25,718
His eyes, they were blank, detached.

349
00:20:28,071 --> 00:20:29,051
He looked like...

350
00:20:30,141 --> 00:20:31,334
He looked like Jerry.

351
00:20:33,152 --> 00:20:35,729
- I don't wanna do this again, Abbey.

352
00:20:35,729 --> 00:20:37,001
- I know you don't want to do this, mom.

353
00:20:37,001 --> 00:20:38,031
I don't want to do this either,

354
00:20:38,031 --> 00:20:39,491
but what if they were wrong?

355
00:20:39,491 --> 00:20:41,228
I mean, mom, if you could have
done something to stop Jerry,

356
00:20:41,228 --> 00:20:43,091
you would have done it, right?

357
00:20:43,091 --> 00:20:45,201
- You don't even know
what you're talking about!

358
00:20:45,201 --> 00:20:47,041
You were a baby.

359
00:20:47,041 --> 00:20:48,490
- I was twelve.

360
00:20:48,490 --> 00:20:50,261
- I don't wanna talk about this.

361
00:20:50,261 --> 00:20:52,321
- Mom, there must have
been some kind of signs.

362
00:20:52,321 --> 00:20:54,281
You must have noticed something.

363
00:20:54,281 --> 00:20:56,738
- I can't believe this is happening again.

364
00:20:56,738 --> 00:20:59,061
Are you taking your medications?

365
00:20:59,061 --> 00:21:01,613
- Yes, of course I'm taking my medication.

366
00:21:01,613 --> 00:21:03,341
- But they're not helping?

367
00:21:03,341 --> 00:21:04,521
- They're not helping Jacob.

368
00:21:04,521 --> 00:21:05,961
Jesus, mom.

369
00:21:05,961 --> 00:21:08,091
- Okay, what did you find?

370
00:21:08,091 --> 00:21:09,676
Did you find something?

371
00:21:09,676 --> 00:21:11,501
- No, I don't...

372
00:21:11,501 --> 00:21:13,921
He's cutting up my shoes again

373
00:21:13,921 --> 00:21:17,331
and the nicks on his arms.

374
00:21:17,331 --> 00:21:18,571
- New nicks?

375
00:21:18,571 --> 00:21:19,404
- No.

376
00:21:19,404 --> 00:21:20,237
I don't know.

377
00:21:21,101 --> 00:21:23,711
I mean, mom, what if he hurts me?

378
00:21:23,711 --> 00:21:25,171
What if he hurts someone else?

379
00:21:25,171 --> 00:21:28,271
- Abigail, the things you're saying...

380
00:21:28,271 --> 00:21:29,474
What you're implying,

381
00:21:30,311 --> 00:21:31,651
it's very serious.

382
00:21:31,651 --> 00:21:33,341
- I know!

383
00:21:33,341 --> 00:21:35,671
- I don't think you should tell anyone.

384
00:21:35,671 --> 00:21:37,401
- I'm telling you, mom.

385
00:21:37,401 --> 00:21:39,991
- And I believed you the last time,

386
00:21:39,991 --> 00:21:41,743
all the way to the end.

387
00:21:41,743 --> 00:21:44,161
Universities look for that kind of stuff.

388
00:21:44,161 --> 00:21:45,868
I know they say they don't, but they do.

389
00:21:45,868 --> 00:21:48,061
And all those medications you have him on,

390
00:21:48,061 --> 00:21:49,061
they all go on his record.

391
00:21:49,061 --> 00:21:50,271
I warned you about that;

392
00:21:50,271 --> 00:21:53,591
If something bad happens
and Jacob takes the fall.

393
00:21:53,591 --> 00:21:55,995
- No, mom, I'm trying
to prevent something bad

394
00:21:55,995 --> 00:21:57,721
from happening.

395
00:21:57,721 --> 00:21:59,213
- Maybe you should talk to Howard.

396
00:22:00,046 --> 00:22:00,879
You remember Howard?

397
00:22:00,879 --> 00:22:01,781
Howard's a vault.

398
00:22:01,781 --> 00:22:02,641
- 'Kay, you know what, mom?

399
00:22:02,641 --> 00:22:03,881
I gotta go.

400
00:22:03,881 --> 00:22:05,221
I'll call you later.

401
00:22:05,221 --> 00:22:09,311
- Abigail, you're not sure, are you?

402
00:22:09,311 --> 00:22:11,111
- I'll call you later.

403
00:22:11,111 --> 00:22:12,621
- Call who later?

404
00:22:12,621 --> 00:22:13,454
-  Is that Jacob?

405
00:22:13,454 --> 00:22:14,831
Honey, is that you?

406
00:22:14,831 --> 00:22:15,854
- Nana?

407
00:22:18,258 --> 00:22:19,692
What up, Nana?

408
00:22:19,692 --> 00:22:21,951
- Oh my god, you're gigantic!

409
00:22:21,951 --> 00:22:23,929
So handsome!

410
00:22:23,929 --> 00:22:25,561
- Aw, c'mon now, Nana.

411
00:22:25,561 --> 00:22:27,499
You say that to all the boys!

412
00:22:27,499 --> 00:22:30,091
-  What a horrible face.

413
00:22:30,091 --> 00:22:31,391
Uncross your eyes!

414
00:22:31,391 --> 00:22:32,611
- Nana, my eyes are stuck!

415
00:22:32,611 --> 00:22:34,291
I'm gonna be cross-eyed forever!

416
00:22:34,291 --> 00:22:35,124
Oh my god!

417
00:22:35,124 --> 00:22:35,998
Nana, no!

418
00:22:40,501 --> 00:22:42,751
Hey, thanks for the
birthday cash you sent.

419
00:22:42,751 --> 00:22:43,891
That was awesome.

420
00:22:43,891 --> 00:22:45,298
-  I wanted to get you a present,

421
00:22:45,298 --> 00:22:47,331
but you're so hard to shop for these days.

422
00:22:47,331 --> 00:22:48,501
- Oh, so get this.

423
00:22:48,501 --> 00:22:50,351
Urban has these killer combat boots.

424
00:22:50,351 --> 00:22:52,221
You can order them online and everything.

425
00:22:52,221 --> 00:22:53,161
-  Urban...

426
00:22:53,161 --> 00:22:55,091
Urban what?

427
00:22:55,091 --> 00:22:57,221
- Here, just type in this website, ready?

428
00:22:57,221 --> 00:22:58,334
- Oh no, no, no.

429
00:22:58,334 --> 00:22:59,167
I can't.

430
00:22:59,167 --> 00:23:01,501
Just buy the boots with the
birthday present I sent.

431
00:23:01,501 --> 00:23:03,631
- What if you set me up with a credit card

432
00:23:03,631 --> 00:23:05,661
and I'll hook you up with
a dope-ass Snapchat account

433
00:23:05,661 --> 00:23:08,221
where you can see what I'm
doing like every five minutes.

434
00:23:08,221 --> 00:23:09,977
- Don't listen to him, mom.

435
00:23:09,977 --> 00:23:11,278
- Yeah, you may have gotten bigger

436
00:23:11,278 --> 00:23:13,211
but you haven't changed a bit!

437
00:23:13,211 --> 00:23:14,701
- Is that a yes?

438
00:23:14,701 --> 00:23:17,651
- No, you can get him a
credit card when he's 18.

439
00:23:17,651 --> 00:23:18,484
-  Deal.

440
00:23:18,484 --> 00:23:20,114
But I better put a limit on it.

441
00:23:22,831 --> 00:23:24,331
- Did you just hang up on her?

442
00:23:25,744 --> 00:23:27,274
Why would you do that?

443
00:23:27,274 --> 00:23:28,982
- When I'm 18?

444
00:23:28,982 --> 00:23:29,815
Please.

445
00:23:50,011 --> 00:23:50,934
-  Jacob?

446
00:23:55,101 --> 00:23:57,562
Jacob, I know you're down here.

447
00:24:08,031 --> 00:24:09,094
Jacob, honey?

448
00:24:10,892 --> 00:24:11,725
- Ah!

449
00:24:11,725 --> 00:24:13,741
-  Oh my god!

450
00:24:13,741 --> 00:24:14,901
Jesus, you scared...

451
00:24:17,928 --> 00:24:18,891
God damn it...

452
00:24:21,874 --> 00:24:23,431
Are you in my robe?

453
00:24:23,431 --> 00:24:25,486
-  Shipping
out your Eczema cream,

454
00:24:25,486 --> 00:24:26,319
but we couldn't retail your--

455
00:24:28,294 --> 00:24:30,571
For the cosmetic moisturizing gloves

456
00:24:30,571 --> 00:24:33,221
because it looks like your
mom's credit card expired.

457
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:35,866
- He install this himself?

458
00:24:35,866 --> 00:24:37,031
- I don't know, I guess he must have.

459
00:24:37,031 --> 00:24:39,201
- Man, you got a smart kid on your hands.

460
00:24:39,201 --> 00:24:41,541
- Yeah, thanks.

461
00:24:41,541 --> 00:24:42,801
I really appreciate it.

462
00:24:42,801 --> 00:24:43,634
- Yeah.

463
00:24:59,314 --> 00:25:01,164
- God, it smells like crap in here.

464
00:25:02,151 --> 00:25:04,051
Like burnt rubber or something...

465
00:25:11,911 --> 00:25:14,031
His baby pictures.

466
00:25:14,031 --> 00:25:16,184
He was six when he started drawing these.

467
00:25:17,321 --> 00:25:18,631
As you can see, they've been rescued

468
00:25:18,631 --> 00:25:20,304
from the trash a few times.

469
00:25:23,051 --> 00:25:24,644
I asked him if that was me;

470
00:25:26,110 --> 00:25:28,194
if that was Jacob in Mommy's belly.

471
00:25:29,631 --> 00:25:31,964
He said no, it was Nana;

472
00:25:33,191 --> 00:25:34,844
he didn't know who the baby was.

473
00:25:37,138 --> 00:25:42,084
I mean, if that's Nana,
then who's the baby?

474
00:25:44,511 --> 00:25:46,211
I never told him about my brother.

475
00:25:49,561 --> 00:25:51,014
I never told him about Jerry.

476
00:25:54,351 --> 00:25:55,184
Anyway...

477
00:26:05,151 --> 00:26:06,834
Oh, nice, Jacob.

478
00:26:08,931 --> 00:26:11,232
Oh, Jesus...

479
00:26:11,232 --> 00:26:12,464
Shit.

480
00:26:46,541 --> 00:26:48,371
Oh my god!

481
00:26:48,371 --> 00:26:49,814
Shit, shit, shit!

482
00:26:50,751 --> 00:26:53,304
No, c'mon, get back in.

483
00:26:54,529 --> 00:26:57,304
He feeds these to Adolf, that's all.

484
00:27:12,969 --> 00:27:13,886
What the...

485
00:27:18,446 --> 00:27:19,696
Jesus Christ...

486
00:27:25,184 --> 00:27:26,434
Holy shit.

487
00:27:31,995 --> 00:27:34,495
What the fuck did he do to it?

488
00:27:40,141 --> 00:27:41,101
Oh, Jesus...

489
00:27:43,051 --> 00:27:44,639
I suppose you're gonna
find a rational explanation

490
00:27:44,639 --> 00:27:45,854
for this too, huh?

491
00:27:48,361 --> 00:27:49,484
My name is Abbey.

492
00:27:50,481 --> 00:27:51,744
I'm 42 years old.

493
00:27:52,601 --> 00:27:53,604
I'm a single mom.

494
00:27:55,511 --> 00:28:00,511
I think my 16 year old
son is a psychopath.

495
00:28:03,778 --> 00:28:05,528
I'm not trying to prove it anymore.

496
00:28:06,781 --> 00:28:09,044
By the time, I'm sure it'll be too late.

497
00:28:10,685 --> 00:28:13,035
I'm not doing this for
the authorities, either.

498
00:28:13,983 --> 00:28:15,761
No, I'm...

499
00:28:15,761 --> 00:28:17,374
I'm making these videos for you.

500
00:28:19,344 --> 00:28:20,944
For all you other moms out there

501
00:28:22,517 --> 00:28:25,814
who know deep down that
your kid is a bad kid.

502
00:28:28,090 --> 00:28:29,604
But you still love him.

503
00:28:33,231 --> 00:28:34,484
Because he's your son.

504
00:28:37,939 --> 00:28:39,289
We're gonna look for signs.

505
00:28:41,371 --> 00:28:43,471
We're gonna look for patterns, you and me,

506
00:28:44,541 --> 00:28:46,341
and together, we're gonna figure out

507
00:28:47,731 --> 00:28:49,011
if you are "that" mom

508
00:28:51,053 --> 00:28:52,584
and if your kid is "that" kid.

509
00:28:55,487 --> 00:28:56,801
I mean, let's face it.

510
00:28:58,858 --> 00:29:00,074
If I'm wrong,

511
00:29:02,921 --> 00:29:05,171
if these videos never
see the light of day...

512
00:29:06,921 --> 00:29:11,024
But if I'm right, if you're watching this,

513
00:29:14,561 --> 00:29:17,594
I'm already dead.

514
00:29:23,151 --> 00:29:25,211
I'm not saying therapists can't help,

515
00:29:25,211 --> 00:29:26,831
but do your own research.

516
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,111
And not just on the internet either;

517
00:29:28,111 --> 00:29:30,514
there are books, interviews,
published studies.

518
00:29:31,391 --> 00:29:33,031
Okay, so there's the usual stuff;

519
00:29:33,031 --> 00:29:36,691
the lack of empathy, antisocial behavior,

520
00:29:36,691 --> 00:29:37,691
pathological lying.

521
00:29:37,691 --> 00:29:39,221
That's a big one.

522
00:29:39,221 --> 00:29:40,731
But then there are the more subtle signs

523
00:29:40,731 --> 00:29:45,038
like chronic conspiracy
theories or racism.

524
00:29:46,531 --> 00:29:48,141
That's a big one.

525
00:29:48,141 --> 00:29:50,864
NPV, Narcissistic Personality Disorder.

526
00:29:52,301 --> 00:29:54,721
I hope you're writing this down.

527
00:29:54,721 --> 00:29:57,213
I guess you could always just rewind.

528
00:29:58,481 --> 00:29:59,314
By the way,

529
00:30:00,998 --> 00:30:03,676
if you're not a mom with a troubled kid

530
00:30:03,676 --> 00:30:04,926
and you're watching this,

531
00:30:07,086 --> 00:30:08,286
you're a psychopath too.

532
00:30:10,551 --> 00:30:12,014
Have some fucking respect.

533
00:30:13,911 --> 00:30:14,744
-  You're crazy.

534
00:30:14,744 --> 00:30:15,861
I don't know, man.

535
00:30:15,861 --> 00:30:17,821
- This is Jacob Bell

536
00:30:17,821 --> 00:30:22,191
coming to you live with the
electro shock challenge.

537
00:30:22,191 --> 00:30:24,211
We got a electric dog collar

538
00:30:24,211 --> 00:30:26,451
that I stole from my stupid neighbor

539
00:30:28,071 --> 00:30:33,071
and this should pack a pretty
heavy punch to my jugular.

540
00:30:33,081 --> 00:30:34,851
So let's try some levels.

541
00:30:34,851 --> 00:30:37,981
Let's start with...

542
00:30:37,981 --> 00:30:38,814
Eight.

543
00:30:38,814 --> 00:30:39,941
-  An eight?

544
00:30:39,941 --> 00:30:40,774
Oh shit, man.

545
00:30:40,774 --> 00:30:41,771
You are out of your mind!

546
00:30:41,771 --> 00:30:42,865
- Pussy.

547
00:30:43,731 --> 00:30:44,735
Three--

548
00:30:44,735 --> 00:30:45,568
-  I don't know about this, man.

549
00:30:45,568 --> 00:30:47,140
- Two, one.

550
00:30:48,874 --> 00:30:50,173
- Oh shit!

551
00:30:51,151 --> 00:30:53,870
Bro, are you all right?

552
00:30:53,870 --> 00:30:56,201
- That was fucking awesome!

553
00:30:58,764 --> 00:31:01,121
- What kind of supplies.

554
00:31:01,121 --> 00:31:03,791
- Well, the science lab is missing

555
00:31:04,691 --> 00:31:09,691
some specimen pins,
closures, sodium hydroxide,

556
00:31:11,601 --> 00:31:13,831
a container of formaldehyde.

557
00:31:13,831 --> 00:31:15,781
- Great, so if I hadn't stopped by today

558
00:31:15,781 --> 00:31:19,341
I'd just have to guess
why my son got detention?

559
00:31:19,341 --> 00:31:20,421
- We sent the letter.

560
00:31:20,421 --> 00:31:22,641
- I told you that's not my signature.

561
00:31:22,641 --> 00:31:24,481
- Listen, is this gonna go on his record.

562
00:31:24,481 --> 00:31:25,741
- His record?

563
00:31:25,741 --> 00:31:28,514
No, this stays in his
file until he graduates.

564
00:31:29,601 --> 00:31:30,434
- I don't know why

565
00:31:30,434 --> 00:31:32,421
you guys are still
teaching dissection anyway.

566
00:31:32,421 --> 00:31:34,881
It was banned in the Riverside
district two years ago.

567
00:31:34,881 --> 00:31:36,631
- It's not about dissection, really.

568
00:31:36,631 --> 00:31:38,881
It's more about electric
muscle stimulation;

569
00:31:38,881 --> 00:31:41,461
teaching the students
about the human body.

570
00:31:41,461 --> 00:31:43,031
- Great.

571
00:31:43,031 --> 00:31:46,261
- Look, Jacob is a very gifted student.

572
00:31:46,261 --> 00:31:48,231
I wouldn't worry so much
about what's in his file,

573
00:31:48,231 --> 00:31:51,041
just put it into conversation with him.

574
00:31:51,041 --> 00:31:53,422
Transparency is key
with this sort of thing.

575
00:31:53,422 --> 00:31:54,360
- Of course.

576
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,801
I'm so sorry to have barged in.

577
00:31:56,801 --> 00:31:58,601
- Which parking lot are you in?

578
00:32:00,016 --> 00:32:02,561
-  Where are you going?

579
00:32:02,561 --> 00:32:05,404
Well, he's not going to
Greg's house, that's obvious.

580
00:32:12,187 --> 00:32:14,437
What is he doing over here?

581
00:32:29,313 --> 00:32:30,146
What?

582
00:32:32,094 --> 00:32:33,070
Oh no...

583
00:32:33,070 --> 00:32:33,903
No, no.

584
00:32:38,386 --> 00:32:42,311
I mean, it's not like he can get a gun.

585
00:32:42,311 --> 00:32:43,144
Right?

586
00:32:58,744 --> 00:33:01,594
All right, well, it's on.

587
00:33:02,531 --> 00:33:05,994
I can't figure out how to
do the "record" thingy.

588
00:33:10,061 --> 00:33:13,884
Spy camera number one; kitchen cam.

589
00:33:18,281 --> 00:33:22,481
Okay, so kitchen cam is
housed in this nifty little

590
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:25,961
electrical outlet thingy.

591
00:33:25,961 --> 00:33:29,074
Kitchen cam, meet living room cam.

592
00:33:30,791 --> 00:33:33,531
Looks like a normal digital
picture frame, right?

593
00:33:33,531 --> 00:33:36,231
Except, see that little
pinhole right there?

594
00:33:36,231 --> 00:33:38,031
That's actually a camera.

595
00:33:38,031 --> 00:33:39,271
The best part?

596
00:33:39,271 --> 00:33:40,644
It's motion activated.

597
00:33:41,621 --> 00:33:44,421
Same deal with the one I'm
putting in Jacob's room.

598
00:33:44,421 --> 00:33:45,501
Jacob cam.

599
00:33:45,501 --> 00:33:48,031
So these new cameras will let me see

600
00:33:48,031 --> 00:33:50,551
what Jacob's up to when I'm not home.

601
00:33:50,551 --> 00:33:52,634
Okay, here we go.

602
00:34:00,871 --> 00:34:02,321
Hi Dr. Arden.

603
00:34:02,321 --> 00:34:05,184
I'm sorry, I completely
lost track of time.

604
00:34:05,184 --> 00:34:06,499
- No worries.

605
00:34:06,499 --> 00:34:07,491
You remember me?

606
00:34:07,491 --> 00:34:09,281
- Of course, yeah!

607
00:34:09,281 --> 00:34:13,811
- I watched that clip you
sent; that video from Jacob.

608
00:34:13,811 --> 00:34:16,031
When did this start?

609
00:34:16,031 --> 00:34:17,324
This behavior?

610
00:34:18,814 --> 00:34:20,971
- When he was a baby.

611
00:34:20,971 --> 00:34:22,411
An infant.

612
00:34:22,411 --> 00:34:24,661
He didn't like to be touched

613
00:34:24,661 --> 00:34:28,334
so he'd just lay there screaming at me.

614
00:34:28,334 --> 00:34:31,391
I mean, I was always his mom, you know?

615
00:34:31,391 --> 00:34:33,721
His hero, his protector,

616
00:34:33,721 --> 00:34:37,981
but by the time he was 14 I
didn't know who he was anymore.

617
00:34:37,981 --> 00:34:41,511
- I understand he received
counseling at the time.

618
00:34:41,511 --> 00:34:44,394
- He's been in counseling
since he was seven years old.

619
00:34:45,791 --> 00:34:49,091
He was drawing these disturbing pictures

620
00:34:49,941 --> 00:34:53,541
with this baby with this knife

621
00:34:53,541 --> 00:34:56,161
and, I don't know, some kind of bloodbath.

622
00:34:56,161 --> 00:34:58,741
- Your mother mentioned that, yeah...

623
00:34:58,741 --> 00:35:00,359
Do you remember the
pictures you used to draw

624
00:35:00,359 --> 00:35:02,674
when you were a young girl, Abbey?

625
00:35:05,371 --> 00:35:06,691
- No.

626
00:35:06,691 --> 00:35:09,781
- Yeah, your mother, she
didn't want them in the house.

627
00:35:09,781 --> 00:35:12,494
- I'm sorry...
- What's that?

628
00:35:12,494 --> 00:35:15,531
- I was kinda hoping we
could just talk about Jacob.

629
00:35:15,531 --> 00:35:17,221
- Of course, of course.

630
00:35:17,221 --> 00:35:20,844
Was he ever diagnosed as CU?

631
00:35:21,801 --> 00:35:24,474
Callous and unemotional traits?

632
00:35:25,541 --> 00:35:27,201
- No.

633
00:35:27,201 --> 00:35:30,071
- Has he ever been hospitalized.

634
00:35:30,071 --> 00:35:32,831
- No, he's pretty much outsmarted

635
00:35:32,831 --> 00:35:34,384
every therapist he's ever had.

636
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:36,861
- Do you think Jacob

637
00:35:36,861 --> 00:35:39,884
is really capable of harming you, Abbey?

638
00:35:41,791 --> 00:35:42,624
- I don't know.

639
00:35:44,044 --> 00:35:46,876
I mean, I keep having this crazy dream

640
00:35:46,876 --> 00:35:49,681
where I'm standing on a stool

641
00:35:49,681 --> 00:35:51,281
in the middle of the living room

642
00:35:52,223 --> 00:35:54,601
and there's something around my neck.

643
00:35:54,601 --> 00:35:57,161
Like a rope, but not a rope.

644
00:35:57,161 --> 00:35:58,304
Smoother than a rope.

645
00:36:00,489 --> 00:36:03,581
I've wet myself, I know that sounds crazy,

646
00:36:03,581 --> 00:36:05,901
but my pajama bottoms are wet.

647
00:36:05,901 --> 00:36:07,034
They're itchy.

648
00:36:09,415 --> 00:36:12,444
- How did you get up on that stool?

649
00:36:13,721 --> 00:36:14,554
- I don't know.

650
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:17,504
All I know is that something has happened.

651
00:36:18,381 --> 00:36:21,991
He's done something really really bad.

652
00:36:21,991 --> 00:36:23,631
-  Who?

653
00:36:23,631 --> 00:36:24,464
- Jacob.

654
00:36:28,426 --> 00:36:29,874
And he's giggling,

655
00:36:30,951 --> 00:36:33,521
laughing like he's
proud of what he's done;

656
00:36:33,521 --> 00:36:34,741
he's won, somehow.

657
00:36:34,741 --> 00:36:36,244
Like the joke's on me.

658
00:36:37,135 --> 00:36:40,644
I just kinda wanna step off the stool.

659
00:36:41,811 --> 00:36:43,121
- Do you?

660
00:36:43,121 --> 00:36:44,511
- What?

661
00:36:44,511 --> 00:36:45,631
Oh, no.

662
00:36:45,631 --> 00:36:46,464
No.

663
00:36:46,464 --> 00:36:49,474
- I'd like you to consider, for a moment,

664
00:36:50,771 --> 00:36:54,604
that it's not Jacob who
put you up on that stool.

665
00:36:55,701 --> 00:36:56,781
- What?

666
00:36:56,781 --> 00:36:58,521
I put myself up there?

667
00:36:58,521 --> 00:36:59,861
I wrapped a cord around my own neck

668
00:36:59,861 --> 00:37:02,231
and strung myself from the ceiling?

669
00:37:02,231 --> 00:37:04,951
- Is there any chance that in this dream

670
00:37:04,951 --> 00:37:08,544
it was Jerry who put you up on that stool?

671
00:37:09,631 --> 00:37:10,464
- Seriously?

672
00:37:12,249 --> 00:37:16,421
- I don't want to rule out
any possibilities, that's all.

673
00:37:16,421 --> 00:37:17,791
- I can't believe this is happening.

674
00:37:17,791 --> 00:37:19,177
Of course this is happening.

675
00:37:19,177 --> 00:37:23,951
- The fact that Jacob just
turned 16 is significant, Abbey.

676
00:37:23,951 --> 00:37:27,821
That's the same age
that Jerry was when he--

677
00:37:27,821 --> 00:37:30,798
- Yeah, you know what, I get it.

678
00:37:30,798 --> 00:37:32,781
The last thing I need right now

679
00:37:32,781 --> 00:37:35,181
is someone else telling
me that I'm the problem.

680
00:37:36,291 --> 00:37:37,734
Fucking asshole.

681
00:37:39,701 --> 00:37:40,960
Fuck.

682
00:37:47,281 --> 00:37:48,131
Look at the rest.

683
00:38:07,992 --> 00:38:08,825
Not bad.

684
00:38:13,301 --> 00:38:15,201
It looks like a smoke detector, right?

685
00:38:17,011 --> 00:38:18,204
Safety first.

686
00:38:19,171 --> 00:38:23,154
Okay, so it's Monday, 3:30-ish.

687
00:38:26,951 --> 00:38:28,431
It's smaller than his, I know,

688
00:38:28,431 --> 00:38:31,794
but when we moved it was his
turn to get the big closet.

689
00:38:32,681 --> 00:38:35,394
Hey, take a look at this.

690
00:38:35,394 --> 00:38:36,227
Eh?

691
00:38:38,971 --> 00:38:41,854
That, my friends, is a live feed.

692
00:38:43,821 --> 00:38:47,161
I couldn't figure out how to get you,

693
00:38:47,161 --> 00:38:49,911
mister nanny cam, to hook up.

694
00:38:49,911 --> 00:38:51,441
You're too old.

695
00:38:51,441 --> 00:38:53,781
You're incompatible or something.

696
00:38:53,781 --> 00:38:55,561
Don't take it personally.

697
00:38:55,561 --> 00:38:57,421
Yeah, see, look.

698
00:38:57,421 --> 00:39:00,021
That one went off 'cause
no one's in the living room

699
00:39:00,909 --> 00:39:02,114
or the kitchen.

700
00:39:03,721 --> 00:39:07,061
Now I think Jacob cam is
still recording, because,

701
00:39:07,061 --> 00:39:09,714
do you see that in there?

702
00:39:11,391 --> 00:39:16,391
That, my friends, is a
birthday present from dad.

703
00:39:16,571 --> 00:39:18,611
Belated, FYI.

704
00:39:18,611 --> 00:39:22,201
It is an aquarium with a couple of rats.

705
00:39:22,201 --> 00:39:24,101
I'm not joking, that's what he wanted.

706
00:39:48,811 --> 00:39:51,191
We're supposed to be
getting him gym shorts

707
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:54,104
and a 200 watt transformer,
whatever the hell that is.

708
00:39:55,481 --> 00:39:57,031
We've been at this store
all of five minutes

709
00:39:57,031 --> 00:39:58,281
and Jacob is already MIA.

710
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:01,364
Surprise.

711
00:40:03,061 --> 00:40:04,101
Just show me the cover.

712
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,771
- Greg's mom let him get
this when he was, like, 12.

713
00:40:05,771 --> 00:40:07,084
- Well I'm not Greg's mom.

714
00:40:11,688 --> 00:40:13,311
- What's with the drives?

715
00:40:13,311 --> 00:40:14,144
- Oh, um...

716
00:40:14,144 --> 00:40:15,801
For my photos.

717
00:40:15,801 --> 00:40:16,634
- What photos?

718
00:40:16,634 --> 00:40:17,467
- You know, for work.

719
00:40:17,467 --> 00:40:18,901
Real estate listings, open houses.

720
00:40:18,901 --> 00:40:20,141
This says 18 and over, Jacob.

721
00:40:20,141 --> 00:40:20,974
- What listings?

722
00:40:20,974 --> 00:40:22,461
You haven't sold a
property in like a year.

723
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:23,341
- I can't let you get this.

724
00:40:23,341 --> 00:40:24,394
Get something else.

725
00:40:27,011 --> 00:40:28,134
- Like a PlayStation?

726
00:40:29,921 --> 00:40:32,421
- Actually, I was thinking
maybe instead of paying me back

727
00:40:32,421 --> 00:40:35,611
we could work out a
different kind of deal.

728
00:40:35,611 --> 00:40:36,908
-  Like what?

729
00:40:36,908 --> 00:40:37,741
- I don't know.

730
00:40:37,741 --> 00:40:39,871
Maybe we could talk, have a conversation.

731
00:40:39,871 --> 00:40:41,944
-  About what?

732
00:40:43,143 --> 00:40:45,301
- I don't know, anything.

733
00:40:45,301 --> 00:40:46,201
Whatever comes up.

734
00:40:47,581 --> 00:40:49,831
You know, 15 minutes a day
for like, I don't know,

735
00:40:49,831 --> 00:40:50,704
a week.

736
00:40:51,691 --> 00:40:52,524
- Five days?

737
00:40:53,531 --> 00:40:54,761
- Seven.

738
00:40:54,761 --> 00:40:55,594
- Four.

739
00:40:56,771 --> 00:40:57,724
- Fine, five.

740
00:41:00,191 --> 00:41:02,791
- How 'bout we have a
conversation right now

741
00:41:02,791 --> 00:41:05,904
for an hour and 15 minutes
and I get it back today?

742
00:41:07,501 --> 00:41:08,934
- Starting tomorrow, Jacob.

743
00:41:11,761 --> 00:41:12,851
Hey, honey, turn right.

744
00:41:12,851 --> 00:41:15,001
Your transformer thingy
should be in aisle four.

745
00:41:15,001 --> 00:41:16,091
What do you need it for anyway?

746
00:41:16,091 --> 00:41:17,461
Hey, can you slow down?

747
00:41:17,461 --> 00:41:19,791
- Conversation starts tomorrow, mom.

748
00:41:19,791 --> 00:41:20,864
- Oh c'mon, Jacob.

749
00:41:23,681 --> 00:41:26,521
-  So you moved
here with your mom, right?

750
00:41:26,521 --> 00:41:27,354
- Yup.

751
00:41:28,811 --> 00:41:29,814
- Well, where's your dad?

752
00:41:31,431 --> 00:41:32,671
- That's enough.

753
00:41:32,671 --> 00:41:33,651
Your turn.
- C'mon.

754
00:41:33,651 --> 00:41:34,931
- How do you like being filmed?

755
00:41:34,931 --> 00:41:35,921
- Oh, come on.

756
00:41:35,921 --> 00:41:36,754
-  How do you like it?

757
00:41:36,754 --> 00:41:38,261
Yo, I'm in the street, Jacob.

758
00:41:38,261 --> 00:41:39,411
That's dangerous.

759
00:41:39,411 --> 00:41:41,161
Stop, I'm serious.

760
00:41:41,161 --> 00:41:41,994
Fucking dick.

761
00:41:43,831 --> 00:41:46,051
- No, I already uploaded all the footage

762
00:41:46,051 --> 00:41:47,961
on an external drive and I can't view it

763
00:41:47,961 --> 00:41:49,768
because I keep getting this
error message that says,

764
00:41:49,768 --> 00:41:51,348
"operation not allowed".

765
00:41:52,261 --> 00:41:53,624
I need what program?

766
00:41:55,671 --> 00:41:57,791
You guys are real crooks, you know that?

767
00:41:57,791 --> 00:41:58,911
-  Hi.

768
00:41:58,911 --> 00:42:00,541
- Jacob?

769
00:42:00,541 --> 00:42:01,481
- What's that?

770
00:42:01,481 --> 00:42:03,301
-  I didn't say anything.

771
00:42:03,301 --> 00:42:04,321
- Your face keeps freezing.

772
00:42:04,321 --> 00:42:05,154
Can you hear me?

773
00:42:05,154 --> 00:42:05,987
- Yeah, I can hear you.

774
00:42:05,987 --> 00:42:06,820
Can you hear me?

775
00:42:06,820 --> 00:42:07,653
-  What's that?

776
00:42:07,653 --> 00:42:09,461
- I said I can hear you fine.

777
00:42:09,461 --> 00:42:10,551
- Mom.

778
00:42:10,551 --> 00:42:11,384
-  What?

779
00:42:11,384 --> 00:42:12,554
Why can't you hear me?

780
00:42:13,761 --> 00:42:14,884
- Gotcha.

781
00:42:15,771 --> 00:42:18,388
You thought this is a live feed, right?

782
00:42:18,388 --> 00:42:20,001
Here's a little tip.

783
00:42:20,001 --> 00:42:22,781
If you don't see your image in
the bottom right hand corner,

784
00:42:22,781 --> 00:42:23,614
it's not live.

785
00:42:23,614 --> 00:42:25,271
It's prerecorded.

786
00:42:25,271 --> 00:42:26,291
So even though it seems

787
00:42:26,291 --> 00:42:28,061
like we're having a
conversation right now,

788
00:42:28,061 --> 00:42:29,024
we're really not.

789
00:42:30,694 --> 00:42:31,527
Sike!

790
00:42:31,527 --> 00:42:32,554
I'm totally kidding.

791
00:42:32,554 --> 00:42:34,966
I'm using this new program Greg has.

792
00:42:34,966 --> 00:42:36,874
What's it called, dude?

793
00:42:37,924 --> 00:42:39,171
- What's what called?

794
00:42:39,171 --> 00:42:40,771
- This new program they're beta testing

795
00:42:40,771 --> 00:42:43,071
that's better than Google
Hangout or whatever.

796
00:42:44,342 --> 00:42:47,234
He said it's called "Smart
Chat for Idiots", I guess.

797
00:42:48,951 --> 00:42:49,784
Mom--

798
00:42:49,784 --> 00:42:50,874
- That's not funny.

799
00:42:50,874 --> 00:42:51,913
-  Mom.

800
00:42:51,913 --> 00:42:52,746
- What?

801
00:42:53,881 --> 00:42:55,091
- Do you know why it's called that?

802
00:42:55,091 --> 00:42:56,281
-  No, I don't.

803
00:42:56,281 --> 00:42:57,291
It's probably a spinoff

804
00:42:57,291 --> 00:42:58,841
from the whole "For Dummies" franchise.

805
00:42:58,841 --> 00:43:01,061
- Oh and guess what I'm doing right now.

806
00:43:01,061 --> 00:43:01,894
- I don't know.

807
00:43:01,894 --> 00:43:03,201
You're talking to me, sort of.

808
00:43:03,201 --> 00:43:04,781
- Eh, wrong, try again.

809
00:43:04,781 --> 00:43:06,321
- You're fucking with her, right?

810
00:43:06,321 --> 00:43:08,504
- The "F" word is not okay, Greg.

811
00:43:09,491 --> 00:43:10,324
Right mom?

812
00:43:11,771 --> 00:43:13,901
- Who are you messing with?

813
00:43:13,901 --> 00:43:15,101
Are you messing with me?

814
00:43:16,409 --> 00:43:17,591
-  Jacob!

815
00:43:17,591 --> 00:43:19,244
- Jesus Christ!

816
00:43:19,244 --> 00:43:20,811
Fuck off.

817
00:43:20,811 --> 00:43:21,971
- I'm hanging up right now.

818
00:43:21,971 --> 00:43:23,471
-  Topic number one.

819
00:43:23,471 --> 00:43:25,733
How many idiots can there
really be in this world?

820
00:43:25,733 --> 00:43:28,641
- And this does not count as
one of our conversations, FYI.

821
00:43:28,641 --> 00:43:29,755
- I mean, we've got Greg here.

822
00:43:29,755 --> 00:43:31,151
He's clearly an idiot.

823
00:43:31,151 --> 00:43:32,221
And then there's...

824
00:43:33,171 --> 00:43:34,071
Well, there's you.

825
00:43:35,541 --> 00:43:37,491
You're an ever bigger idiot than he is.

826
00:43:38,461 --> 00:43:41,261
Because even though I actually
told you this wasn't live,

827
00:43:41,261 --> 00:43:43,701
that it couldn't be unless
you saw your own image

828
00:43:43,701 --> 00:43:45,001
in the bottom right hand corner,

829
00:43:45,001 --> 00:43:48,291
you're still talking back
to this prerecorded video,

830
00:43:48,291 --> 00:43:49,124
aren't you?

831
00:43:50,961 --> 00:43:52,181
Sorry to break it to you, mom,

832
00:43:52,181 --> 00:43:55,101
but the only part of "Smart
Chat for Idiots" that's real

833
00:43:55,101 --> 00:43:56,324
is the idiot part.

834
00:43:57,159 --> 00:43:58,271
And that would be...

835
00:44:02,461 --> 00:44:04,111
I bet there's a little part of you

836
00:44:04,111 --> 00:44:05,891
that still wants to believe this is live.

837
00:44:05,891 --> 00:44:06,724
Am I right?

838
00:44:10,398 --> 00:44:12,728
"Jacob is live."

839
00:44:12,728 --> 00:44:13,817
"Snapchat me."

840
00:44:13,817 --> 00:44:16,448
"I'm one of the cool moms."

841
00:44:18,241 --> 00:44:19,111
Well guess what.

842
00:44:20,227 --> 00:44:22,151
You'll never be one of the cool moms

843
00:44:22,151 --> 00:44:23,934
because you're a fucking idiot.

844
00:44:25,551 --> 00:44:27,881
One convo down, only four to go.

845
00:44:27,881 --> 00:44:29,931
So why don't we meet back here tomorrow?

846
00:44:31,531 --> 00:44:33,112
Same time, same--

847
00:44:35,451 --> 00:44:36,284
Place.

848
00:44:38,001 --> 00:44:38,864
You still there?

849
00:44:40,381 --> 00:44:41,214
You better be.

850
00:44:42,841 --> 00:44:45,571
Because I'm holding up
my end of the bargain.

851
00:44:45,571 --> 00:44:46,821
Because that was our deal

852
00:44:47,751 --> 00:44:52,751
and I want my fucking PlayStation back.

853
00:45:14,121 --> 00:45:15,301
Mom!

854
00:45:15,301 --> 00:45:16,391
-  One sec!

855
00:45:16,391 --> 00:45:17,934
- You got another package!

856
00:45:21,293 --> 00:45:22,126
- What?

857
00:45:24,626 --> 00:45:25,476
What did you say?

858
00:45:26,431 --> 00:45:28,694
Oh, probably just my Eczema cream.

859
00:45:31,861 --> 00:45:33,961
- You should really be wearing your mitts.

860
00:45:37,481 --> 00:45:38,880
So what'd you think?

861
00:45:38,880 --> 00:45:40,271
- On what?

862
00:45:40,271 --> 00:45:41,314
- The video.

863
00:45:42,261 --> 00:45:44,931
- I thought it was mean.

864
00:45:46,611 --> 00:45:47,731
- I totally got you.

865
00:45:47,731 --> 00:45:49,344
- It's not funny, Jacob.

866
00:45:50,445 --> 00:45:53,104
You called me an idiot
in front of your friend.

867
00:45:54,051 --> 00:45:55,278
- He's not my friend.

868
00:45:56,684 --> 00:45:58,361
- What do you mean?

869
00:45:58,361 --> 00:45:59,254
What happened?

870
00:46:02,721 --> 00:46:03,554
Jacob?

871
00:46:07,491 --> 00:46:08,691
- How many minutes left?

872
00:46:09,761 --> 00:46:10,934
- Don't be like that.

873
00:46:13,561 --> 00:46:14,394
Fine,

874
00:46:16,701 --> 00:46:19,114
fifteen starting now.

875
00:46:20,521 --> 00:46:21,354
- Cheater.

876
00:46:23,891 --> 00:46:26,504
Volt 100, meet mom.

877
00:46:27,771 --> 00:46:29,334
Or maybe this is Volt 200.

878
00:46:31,491 --> 00:46:32,881
-  So what happened
with you and Greg?

879
00:46:32,881 --> 00:46:34,091
- Nothing.

880
00:46:34,091 --> 00:46:35,731
-  Can we just talk for a minute?

881
00:46:35,731 --> 00:46:36,704
- We are talking.

882
00:46:38,941 --> 00:46:40,651
What's that thing?

883
00:46:40,651 --> 00:46:43,734
Um, I just thought I'd
put some pictures up.

884
00:46:44,741 --> 00:46:46,001
So what happened with you and Greg?

885
00:46:46,001 --> 00:46:47,981
- Is that on a digital loop or something?

886
00:46:47,981 --> 00:46:49,561
- Digital what?

887
00:46:49,561 --> 00:46:50,681
Can you stop doing that?

888
00:46:50,681 --> 00:46:52,081
Stop pivoting.

889
00:46:52,081 --> 00:46:52,914
Just talk to me.

890
00:46:52,914 --> 00:46:54,711
What happened with you and Greg?

891
00:46:54,711 --> 00:46:56,531
Did you guys have a fight or something?

892
00:46:56,531 --> 00:46:57,541
- Doesn't matter.

893
00:46:57,541 --> 00:46:59,418
- Of course it matters,
he's your best friend.

894
00:46:59,418 --> 00:47:00,741
- No, he's not.

895
00:47:00,741 --> 00:47:03,801
He's a lowlife circumcised douche bag.

896
00:47:03,801 --> 00:47:04,634
- What?

897
00:47:04,634 --> 00:47:06,781
- How many photos are in this thing?

898
00:47:06,781 --> 00:47:08,491
- I don't know, twelve, maybe?

899
00:47:08,491 --> 00:47:10,071
- Who took this one at the beach?

900
00:47:10,071 --> 00:47:11,151
Dad?

901
00:47:11,151 --> 00:47:11,984
- Probably.

902
00:47:11,984 --> 00:47:13,542
Jacob, what do you mean by circumcised?

903
00:47:13,542 --> 00:47:14,741
- He's even a shitty photographer.

904
00:47:14,741 --> 00:47:15,652
- Jacob!

905
00:47:15,652 --> 00:47:16,485
- I don't know, mom.

906
00:47:16,485 --> 00:47:18,501
Circumcised, like they cut
the tip of his dick off.

907
00:47:19,736 --> 00:47:20,914
- So?

908
00:47:20,914 --> 00:47:22,114
- So he's a fucking Jew.

909
00:47:23,380 --> 00:47:24,213
- So?

910
00:47:25,311 --> 00:47:27,991
- I totally remember those gay pajamas.

911
00:47:27,991 --> 00:47:29,731
- Jacob, what do you
care if Greg is Jewish?

912
00:47:29,731 --> 00:47:31,831
- Why do you get to ask all the questions?

913
00:47:33,341 --> 00:47:35,211
So how come my inheritance is contingent

914
00:47:35,211 --> 00:47:37,081
on me going to college?

915
00:47:37,081 --> 00:47:38,131
Doesn't Nana know by now

916
00:47:38,131 --> 00:47:39,681
that college is a total waste of time?

917
00:47:39,681 --> 00:47:41,371
What did you major in, again?

918
00:47:41,371 --> 00:47:42,454
Psychology?

919
00:47:43,621 --> 00:47:45,501
-  What's your point, Jacob?

920
00:47:45,501 --> 00:47:48,201
- Hasn't it ever occurred to
you that college is just a scam

921
00:47:48,201 --> 00:47:52,131
perpetuated by none other
than, well, dumbfuck parents?

922
00:47:52,131 --> 00:47:52,964
-  Jacob...

923
00:47:52,964 --> 00:47:53,911
- Isn't it a little strange

924
00:47:53,911 --> 00:47:56,541
that right before a kid turns 18,

925
00:47:56,541 --> 00:47:57,374
right when their parents

926
00:47:57,374 --> 00:47:59,401
still have legal authority over them

927
00:47:59,401 --> 00:48:01,481
happens to coincide with the exact age

928
00:48:01,481 --> 00:48:03,921
of your average would-be freshman?

929
00:48:03,921 --> 00:48:07,241
Right in that unbelievably
little convenient pocket of time,

930
00:48:07,241 --> 00:48:11,441
kids get coerced by their own
parents into a nationwide,

931
00:48:11,441 --> 00:48:14,474
bonafide, institutionalized Ponzi scheme.

932
00:48:16,371 --> 00:48:18,278
Wow, you look shit faced in that one.

933
00:48:24,781 --> 00:48:27,014
-  Wanna know why I
think you should go to college?

934
00:48:28,451 --> 00:48:30,201
'Cause I think you're really smart.

935
00:48:31,470 --> 00:48:33,341
- So what do I need college for?

936
00:48:33,341 --> 00:48:36,081
- Because it's a great place to, you know,

937
00:48:36,081 --> 00:48:37,111
figure out what you're good at,

938
00:48:37,111 --> 00:48:38,511
what you want to do in life.

939
00:48:39,561 --> 00:48:41,231
- Total propaganda.

940
00:48:41,231 --> 00:48:42,461
I already know what I'm good at.

941
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:43,931
- Yeah?

942
00:48:43,931 --> 00:48:45,331
What are you good at, Jacob?

943
00:48:46,221 --> 00:48:47,841
- You don't know?

944
00:48:47,841 --> 00:48:49,331
-  I think you're
good at a lot of things.

945
00:48:49,331 --> 00:48:50,918
- Name one.

946
00:48:50,918 --> 00:48:53,281
-  Well I think
your good at science.

947
00:48:53,281 --> 00:48:54,861
- Not according to Mr. Fuckner.

948
00:48:54,861 --> 00:48:56,231
-  Yeah, can we talk
about that for a minute?

949
00:48:56,231 --> 00:48:58,384
Why you got detention from Mr. Buckner?

950
00:49:00,051 --> 00:49:01,521
- You want a hint?

951
00:49:01,521 --> 00:49:02,354
-  No, Jacob.

952
00:49:02,354 --> 00:49:03,871
I don't want a hint,
I want you to tell me.

953
00:49:03,871 --> 00:49:05,201
- Ow, fuck!

954
00:49:05,201 --> 00:49:06,371
It fucking bit me!

955
00:49:06,371 --> 00:49:07,204
-  Oh my god, honey.

956
00:49:07,204 --> 00:49:08,037
Let me see!
- Ow, ow, ow!

957
00:49:08,037 --> 00:49:09,611
My finger, it's bleeding everywhere.

958
00:49:09,611 --> 00:49:10,444
-  I can't see.

959
00:49:10,444 --> 00:49:11,808
Which finger?

960
00:49:15,058 --> 00:49:15,891
- Gotcha.

961
00:49:18,821 --> 00:49:19,654
See mom.

962
00:49:19,654 --> 00:49:20,934
I'm good at psychology.

963
00:49:21,921 --> 00:49:23,421
I don't need a fucking degree.

964
00:49:28,071 --> 00:49:29,794
- What is wrong with you?

965
00:49:34,291 --> 00:49:35,484
- Mom, your alarm.

966
00:49:37,421 --> 00:49:40,844
-  For your information,
Nana's mother was Jewish.

967
00:49:41,851 --> 00:49:43,504
So technically, you're a Jew too.

968
00:49:44,981 --> 00:49:46,301
- Seriously, can you shut it off?

969
00:49:46,301 --> 00:49:47,751
It's really fucking annoying.

970
00:50:13,981 --> 00:50:14,814
- Hello?

971
00:50:16,241 --> 00:50:17,711
Hi.

972
00:50:17,711 --> 00:50:19,214
Yes, I heard.

973
00:50:21,861 --> 00:50:22,694
What?

974
00:50:24,037 --> 00:50:24,870
Oh my god.

975
00:50:27,191 --> 00:50:28,104
Is Greg okay?

976
00:50:32,021 --> 00:50:34,351
Well, if he's too afraid
to admit Jacob did it,

977
00:50:34,351 --> 00:50:36,451
how am I supposed to talk to him about it?

978
00:50:38,421 --> 00:50:42,261
Well, no, I understand, but
maybe we should file a police--

979
00:50:44,741 --> 00:50:46,834
No, of course, I understand.

980
00:50:50,091 --> 00:50:51,814
Hey, maybe I could come by.

981
00:50:54,181 --> 00:50:55,354
No, sure.

982
00:50:56,511 --> 00:50:58,944
Look, I'm so sorry.

983
00:51:06,379 --> 00:51:09,546
The boys were playing with a gas mask.

984
00:51:10,541 --> 00:51:13,594
Someone put formaldehyde
in the air canister.

985
00:51:23,421 --> 00:51:24,254
Boys.

986
00:51:24,254 --> 00:51:25,131
Boys, boys, boys, stop!

987
00:51:25,131 --> 00:51:25,964
Jacob!

988
00:51:27,086 --> 00:51:28,481
You're not in trouble, sweetheart.

989
00:51:28,481 --> 00:51:30,731
She just doesn't want
you to throw it at her.

990
00:51:31,631 --> 00:51:33,214
Jacob, don't throw that at her.

991
00:51:33,214 --> 00:51:34,047
- No!

992
00:51:34,047 --> 00:51:34,880
-  Don't throw it!

993
00:51:34,880 --> 00:51:35,713
Jacob--

994
00:51:41,761 --> 00:51:42,594
Hey.

995
00:51:42,594 --> 00:51:43,427
- What's on your face?

996
00:51:43,427 --> 00:51:44,861
You look like a freak.

997
00:51:44,861 --> 00:51:46,111
-  So where you going?

998
00:51:46,111 --> 00:51:46,994
- Stalker.

999
00:51:48,231 --> 00:51:51,231
Listen, I think you should spend
this weekend with your dad.

1000
00:51:52,331 --> 00:51:54,031
I bought you a bus ticket.

1001
00:51:54,031 --> 00:51:55,676
- Fuck, mom, I'm 16.

1002
00:51:55,676 --> 00:51:59,154
- 3:00 p.m. tomorrow,
you're on a bus to see dad.

1003
00:52:14,745 --> 00:52:15,578
- Mom?

1004
00:52:25,111 --> 00:52:26,541
-  Launched a joint air strike

1005
00:52:26,541 --> 00:52:29,761
with the United States
and France against Syria.

1006
00:52:29,761 --> 00:52:32,335
White Power marched through
the streets of Charlottesville

1007
00:52:32,335 --> 00:52:34,914
without hoods and without shame.

1008
00:52:37,489 --> 00:52:40,594
This is the largest national
rally in over two decades.

1009
00:52:40,594 --> 00:52:43,991
There's a lot more of us
than this country realizes

1010
00:52:43,991 --> 00:52:45,091
and we're done hiding.

1011
00:52:46,231 --> 00:52:47,144
Did you see that?

1012
00:52:47,144 --> 00:52:48,221
They maced me.

1013
00:52:48,221 --> 00:52:49,097
This is war!

1014
00:52:49,097 --> 00:52:50,815
We'll kill these people if we have to.

1015
00:52:54,031 --> 00:52:58,741
Perfect storm of easy access
to guns, ongoing cuts and--

1016
00:53:53,904 --> 00:53:56,601
- Yes, yes, I am spying on my son.

1017
00:53:56,601 --> 00:53:58,301
I never told him about my brother.

1018
00:54:01,511 --> 00:54:03,641
I never told him about Jerry.

1019
00:54:04,881 --> 00:54:05,714
-  Weirdo.

1020
00:54:05,714 --> 00:54:08,001
- Standing on a stool in the
middle of the living room

1021
00:54:08,001 --> 00:54:10,834
and there's something around my neck.

1022
00:54:11,931 --> 00:54:13,431
What the fuck did he do to it?

1023
00:54:15,021 --> 00:54:15,863
Jacob!

1024
00:54:15,863 --> 00:54:16,863
Stop it now!

1025
00:54:18,526 --> 00:54:19,652
What if it's genetic?

1026
00:54:19,652 --> 00:54:23,652
- No!

1027
00:54:25,421 --> 00:54:29,584
- The boy who cried wolf got
eaten by the fucking wolf.

1028
00:54:30,901 --> 00:54:31,748
-  Dude, go, go!

1029
00:54:37,031 --> 00:54:37,864
- Jacob cam.

1030
00:54:37,864 --> 00:54:38,911
- Remember me?
- Jerry.

1031
00:54:40,891 --> 00:54:42,394
My name is Abbey.

1032
00:54:45,501 --> 00:54:47,101
I think my 16 year old son

1033
00:54:49,741 --> 00:54:50,734
is a psychopath.

1034
00:55:09,605 --> 00:55:14,605
- Well, actually, he's at his dad's.

1035
00:55:15,351 --> 00:55:17,294
I told you, Frank was fine with it.

1036
00:55:19,371 --> 00:55:21,201
He's not missing any school.

1037
00:55:21,201 --> 00:55:22,261
It's Friday.

1038
00:55:22,261 --> 00:55:25,180
That's him on the other
line, I gotta call you back.

1039
00:55:25,180 --> 00:55:26,013
No, Frank.

1040
00:55:27,551 --> 00:55:30,091
Mom, I didn't dump him on anyone, okay?

1041
00:55:30,091 --> 00:55:31,691
Can you give me a fucking break?

1042
00:55:32,751 --> 00:55:33,584
Hello?

1043
00:55:34,433 --> 00:55:35,266
Shit...

1044
00:55:51,081 --> 00:55:51,914
Hello?

1045
00:56:03,478 --> 00:56:04,311
Hello?

1046
00:56:15,961 --> 00:56:17,469
Hey, Frank, sorry about that.

1047
00:56:17,469 --> 00:56:18,469
I was just--

1048
00:56:19,488 --> 00:56:20,524
What do you mean?

1049
00:56:22,101 --> 00:56:24,814
No, I dropped him off
at the station at 2:45.

1050
00:56:26,621 --> 00:56:27,454
Fairview.

1051
00:56:29,251 --> 00:56:31,321
Well did you actually
go down and pick him up

1052
00:56:31,321 --> 00:56:32,154
or did you just--

1053
00:56:33,711 --> 00:56:34,544
Hold on.

1054
00:56:38,021 --> 00:56:38,854
Jacob!

1055
00:56:39,691 --> 00:56:41,191
-  See, if I was surrounded

1056
00:56:41,191 --> 00:56:42,521
by six or eight of these things,

1057
00:56:42,521 --> 00:56:43,911
would I stand a chance with them?

1058
00:56:43,911 --> 00:56:45,071
Well there's no problem.

1059
00:56:45,071 --> 00:56:46,527
If you have a gun,
shoot them in the head--

1060
00:56:46,527 --> 00:56:47,428
- No, I don't know, it's just...

1061
00:56:47,428 --> 00:56:51,178
The television just went
off for some reason.

1062
00:56:52,178 --> 00:56:53,781
Just bear with me, Frank.

1063
00:56:53,781 --> 00:56:54,614
Don't hang up.

1064
00:56:59,801 --> 00:57:00,634
Jacob!

1065
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:09,214
Yeah, he's here.

1066
00:57:14,217 --> 00:57:15,622
Turn it down.

1067
00:57:15,622 --> 00:57:16,455
- What?

1068
00:57:16,455 --> 00:57:17,954
- Your stereo, turn it down.

1069
00:57:21,440 --> 00:57:23,261
He's supposed to be with you...

1070
00:57:23,261 --> 00:57:24,094
Frank.

1071
00:57:25,421 --> 00:57:26,254
- Hello?

1072
00:57:28,301 --> 00:57:29,134
Obviously.

1073
00:57:31,541 --> 00:57:32,374
Oh really?

1074
00:57:32,374 --> 00:57:33,801
On a scale of 1 to 10, what's scarier?

1075
00:57:33,801 --> 00:57:35,431
Me not calling or mom
standing in front of me

1076
00:57:35,431 --> 00:57:37,367
with a butcher knife?

1077
00:57:37,367 --> 00:57:38,590
- It's not a butcher knife.

1078
00:57:38,590 --> 00:57:40,397
It's not a butcher knife!

1079
00:57:40,397 --> 00:57:42,828
I was making a salad; it's a salad knife.

1080
00:57:42,828 --> 00:57:43,661
- Jesus...

1081
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:45,751
Can we have some privacy, please?

1082
00:57:45,751 --> 00:57:46,584
Dad?

1083
00:57:48,111 --> 00:57:48,944
- Shit.

1084
00:57:53,343 --> 00:57:54,288
Define "privacy".

1085
00:57:55,832 --> 00:57:57,071
Butcher knife.

1086
00:57:57,071 --> 00:57:57,904
Please.

1087
00:58:01,201 --> 00:58:02,451
- I don't know.

1088
00:58:05,566 --> 00:58:06,399
- Shit.

1089
00:58:13,485 --> 00:58:14,783
- Oh my god, yes.

1090
00:58:14,783 --> 00:58:17,588
I know, but, y'know, she's my mom.

1091
00:58:19,474 --> 00:58:20,724
- Unbelievable.

1092
00:58:23,101 --> 00:58:26,661
Jacob's saying he didn't
want to leave me alone.

1093
00:58:26,661 --> 00:58:28,711
That he was worried I might "freak out".

1094
00:58:31,823 --> 00:58:32,656
Oh shit.

1095
00:58:33,694 --> 00:58:35,029
Shit, shit, shit, shit, shit...

1096
00:58:35,029 --> 00:58:40,029
No...

1097
00:58:46,231 --> 00:58:48,131
Look, I know I shouldn't
have pawned him off

1098
00:58:48,131 --> 00:58:49,281
on his dad for the weekend,

1099
00:58:49,281 --> 00:58:52,455
but I just needed to clear
my fucking head, okay?

1100
00:58:52,455 --> 00:58:53,711
It's not like I can turn him in.

1101
00:58:53,711 --> 00:58:55,791
He'd probably say the
lizards were already dead

1102
00:58:55,791 --> 00:58:58,254
and he was just doing
a science experiment.

1103
00:58:59,201 --> 00:59:01,990
You know Greg is never gonna rat him out.

1104
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,951
Pun intended.

1105
00:59:03,951 --> 00:59:05,301
So what does that leave me?

1106
00:59:06,396 --> 00:59:07,996
I just wish I could talk to him.

1107
00:59:09,087 --> 00:59:11,054
But he doesn't know how to talk.

1108
00:59:12,461 --> 00:59:13,674
He never really learned.

1109
00:59:17,201 --> 00:59:21,821
If you can still talk
to your son, talk to him

1110
00:59:22,721 --> 00:59:25,644
before he hates you for
allowing him not to.

1111
00:59:29,701 --> 00:59:30,801
I mean, let's face it.

1112
00:59:33,301 --> 00:59:35,751
Even if I could turn him
in, I probably wouldn't.

1113
00:59:38,211 --> 00:59:40,361
For the same millions
of reasons you can't.

1114
00:59:41,261 --> 00:59:42,094
Y'know?

1115
00:59:42,991 --> 00:59:47,991
One more school, one more
semester, one more doctor.

1116
00:59:49,721 --> 00:59:50,744
One more chance.

1117
01:00:12,481 --> 01:00:13,314
Jacob?

1118
01:00:14,241 --> 01:00:15,334
Can we talk?

1119
01:00:17,321 --> 01:00:18,424
I wanna talk.

1120
01:00:21,472 --> 01:00:22,364
I wanna listen.

1121
01:00:23,921 --> 01:00:24,754
Jacob...

1122
01:00:29,381 --> 01:00:31,224
Sweetheart, you still have my phone.

1123
01:01:48,265 --> 01:01:49,098
Jacob?

1124
01:01:57,826 --> 01:01:58,659
Jacob?

1125
01:02:07,921 --> 01:02:08,754
Jacob.

1126
01:02:10,971 --> 01:02:13,231
Unlock the door!

1127
01:02:13,231 --> 01:02:14,064
Jacob!

1128
01:02:17,931 --> 01:02:19,651
You think this is funny?

1129
01:02:19,651 --> 01:02:20,884
Unlock the fucking door.

1130
01:02:28,771 --> 01:02:29,911
Oh no, no, no...

1131
01:02:32,781 --> 01:02:33,614
Oh fuck...

1132
01:02:34,729 --> 01:02:37,062
Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck...

1133
01:02:39,131 --> 01:02:39,964
Okay.

1134
01:02:46,471 --> 01:02:47,684
Jacob, honey.

1135
01:02:49,011 --> 01:02:52,801
Okay, I understand you're
upset about the, you know,

1136
01:02:52,801 --> 01:02:57,801
about the cameras, but I
didn't show anything to anyone.

1137
01:02:58,561 --> 01:03:00,711
I promise, okay?

1138
01:03:00,711 --> 01:03:03,504
So just unlock the door, okay?

1139
01:03:04,491 --> 01:03:05,674
I'm not mad.

1140
01:03:06,801 --> 01:03:07,634
I won't be mad.

1141
01:03:10,864 --> 01:03:11,697
Damn it!

1142
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:13,655
Damn it!

1143
01:03:24,153 --> 01:03:26,104
You think your mother's stupid?

1144
01:03:26,104 --> 01:03:28,441
You think I'm stupid?

1145
01:03:28,441 --> 01:03:29,274
Fuck you...

1146
01:03:30,292 --> 01:03:31,125
All right.

1147
01:03:38,609 --> 01:03:39,629
Let's see if we just--

1148
01:04:16,630 --> 01:04:17,463
Jacob!

1149
01:04:19,519 --> 01:04:20,352
Jacob!

1150
01:04:24,518 --> 01:04:25,351
Jacob!

1151
01:04:31,105 --> 01:04:31,938
Jacob!

1152
01:04:39,601 --> 01:04:41,832
- Sorry about the whole chair thing.

1153
01:04:41,832 --> 01:04:43,504
It's for your own protection.

1154
01:04:44,601 --> 01:04:47,374
Volt 100 tried to escape too.

1155
01:04:48,281 --> 01:04:51,171
Three times, to be exact.

1156
01:04:51,171 --> 01:04:53,371
I haven't figured out
the exact voltage yet.

1157
01:04:54,381 --> 01:04:56,173
Didn't wanna risk it

1158
01:04:56,173 --> 01:04:57,124
for your sake.

1159
01:05:00,215 --> 01:05:02,254
I like your movie!

1160
01:05:04,204 --> 01:05:05,361
I'm not crazy about where you were going

1161
01:05:05,361 --> 01:05:06,651
with the ending, though.

1162
01:05:07,691 --> 01:05:10,081
I mean, where were you going with it?

1163
01:05:10,081 --> 01:05:12,404
Did you really think
I'd shoot up my school?

1164
01:05:13,791 --> 01:05:14,924
So lame.

1165
01:05:17,111 --> 01:05:18,461
We can do better than that.

1166
01:05:20,961 --> 01:05:22,244
So here's the deal, mom.

1167
01:05:23,158 --> 01:05:26,086
Mom!

1168
01:05:26,086 --> 01:05:26,919
Mom.

1169
01:05:28,651 --> 01:05:30,241
Good.

1170
01:05:30,241 --> 01:05:32,731
I've cloned your screen, FYI.

1171
01:05:32,731 --> 01:05:33,991
And everything in your room is hot

1172
01:05:33,991 --> 01:05:36,214
so I wouldn't try anything stupid, okay?

1173
01:05:37,731 --> 01:05:38,884
Nod or something.

1174
01:05:42,221 --> 01:05:43,791
Good.

1175
01:05:43,791 --> 01:05:45,431
So this might be very
hard for you to believe

1176
01:05:45,431 --> 01:05:47,821
but I'm actually not a psychopath.

1177
01:05:47,821 --> 01:05:51,034
I mean, if I was, don't you
think you'd be dead by now?

1178
01:05:53,371 --> 01:05:55,001
And for your information,

1179
01:05:55,001 --> 01:05:57,361
I legally can't be
diagnosed with anything more

1180
01:05:57,361 --> 01:05:59,444
than sociopathic tendencies.

1181
01:06:00,461 --> 01:06:01,631
Under 18.

1182
01:06:01,631 --> 01:06:02,531
Brain's...

1183
01:06:03,801 --> 01:06:05,001
Still developing.

1184
01:06:06,811 --> 01:06:09,851
Of course, Jerry was 16 too,

1185
01:06:09,851 --> 01:06:12,284
so technically he wasn't
a psychopath either.

1186
01:06:14,041 --> 01:06:16,061
But seven kids...

1187
01:06:17,431 --> 01:06:18,454
That's jacked up.

1188
01:06:22,821 --> 01:06:24,874
The internet doesn't keep secrets, mom.

1189
01:06:27,371 --> 01:06:29,781
So here's what's going to happen next;

1190
01:06:29,781 --> 01:06:31,531
I'm going to come in there.

1191
01:06:31,531 --> 01:06:33,291
I'm going to remove your gag,

1192
01:06:33,291 --> 01:06:35,061
you're not going to say anything.

1193
01:06:35,061 --> 01:06:36,941
You're not even gonna open your mouth.

1194
01:06:36,941 --> 01:06:37,994
Got it?

1195
01:06:40,535 --> 01:06:42,131
Then I'm going to untie your hands

1196
01:06:42,131 --> 01:06:43,571
and you're going to use this

1197
01:06:44,971 --> 01:06:47,284
to record a new ending to the movie.

1198
01:06:48,631 --> 01:06:50,054
Part one.

1199
01:06:52,118 --> 01:06:53,598
"My name is Abbey.

1200
01:06:53,598 --> 01:06:55,548
"I'm 42 years old.

1201
01:06:55,548 --> 01:06:59,248
"I'm a single mom and my
son is not a psychopath."

1202
01:07:00,571 --> 01:07:02,194
You have to really mean it, mom.

1203
01:07:04,338 --> 01:07:06,581
"I'm the one with problems".

1204
01:07:06,581 --> 01:07:10,051
Pause; you have to pause after that part.

1205
01:07:10,051 --> 01:07:12,328
You have to really reflect for a minute.

1206
01:07:14,018 --> 01:07:16,491
"I'm the one who needs help."

1207
01:07:16,491 --> 01:07:17,761
Pause again.

1208
01:07:17,761 --> 01:07:19,401
I mean if you could
get a little teary-eyed

1209
01:07:19,401 --> 01:07:22,384
for this next part, that would
totally, totally sell it.

1210
01:07:23,278 --> 01:07:25,544
"I'm the one who told Jerry to do it.

1211
01:07:27,638 --> 01:07:28,998
"I'm the psychopath."

1212
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:32,661
Think you can do that?

1213
01:07:36,420 --> 01:07:38,131
- Somebody help!

1214
01:07:38,131 --> 01:07:40,061
- Sorry, but that's the deal, mom.

1215
01:07:40,061 --> 01:07:41,541
Non-negotiable.

1216
01:07:41,541 --> 01:07:44,841
Then you turn the camera off,
I tie your hands back up,

1217
01:07:44,841 --> 01:07:47,121
I go into the other room and
I play back the recording,

1218
01:07:47,121 --> 01:07:49,619
and if I like it, if you do a really

1219
01:07:49,619 --> 01:07:53,431
really good job with it,
then I upload the footage

1220
01:07:53,431 --> 01:07:56,051
to a protected cloud server and you,

1221
01:07:56,051 --> 01:07:57,701
you get to come out of your room!

1222
01:07:59,371 --> 01:08:01,641
I'm gonna delete the other footage.

1223
01:08:01,641 --> 01:08:03,184
Or most of it, anyway.

1224
01:08:04,611 --> 01:08:06,471
And if you ever mess with me again

1225
01:08:07,611 --> 01:08:10,061
you'll be the one in a
fucking diversion program.

1226
01:08:12,171 --> 01:08:13,004
Cool?

1227
01:08:21,341 --> 01:08:22,254
Memorize it.

1228
01:09:17,077 --> 01:09:17,910
- Jacob.

1229
01:09:19,069 --> 01:09:20,236
Jacob, please.

1230
01:10:05,964 --> 01:10:07,304
My name is Abbey.

1231
01:10:09,531 --> 01:10:10,934
I'm 42 years old.

1232
01:10:13,331 --> 01:10:17,491
I'm a single mom and my son...

1233
01:10:21,011 --> 01:10:22,414
My son is not a psychopath.

1234
01:10:27,170 --> 01:10:29,420
I'm the one who needs help.

1235
01:10:32,291 --> 01:10:33,781
I'm the one who told him...

1236
01:10:35,702 --> 01:10:37,394
Who told Jerry to do it.

1237
01:10:42,112 --> 01:10:43,695
I'm the psychopath.

1238
01:10:49,291 --> 01:10:51,744
- Out-fucking-standing.

1239
01:11:00,071 --> 01:11:00,961
Arms.

1240
01:11:00,961 --> 01:11:02,772
- Jacob, please.

1241
01:11:02,772 --> 01:11:03,611
- Arms.

1242
01:11:03,611 --> 01:11:05,281
- You have what you want.

1243
01:11:05,281 --> 01:11:07,066
I'm not gonna tell anybody,
just let me sit here

1244
01:11:07,066 --> 01:11:08,561
until you come back, okay?

1245
01:11:08,561 --> 01:11:09,594
- Final warning.

1246
01:11:10,511 --> 01:11:12,611
- Jacob, you said that was part one.

1247
01:11:12,611 --> 01:11:13,444
What's part two?

1248
01:11:15,121 --> 01:11:16,004
No!

1249
01:11:16,004 --> 01:11:16,837
No!

1250
01:11:16,837 --> 01:11:17,874
No!

1251
01:11:17,874 --> 01:11:19,211
Stop it!

1252
01:11:19,211 --> 01:11:20,191
What is that?

1253
01:11:20,191 --> 01:11:22,246
Jacob, stop it right now!

1254
01:11:40,133 --> 01:11:42,216
- I didn't wanna do that.

1255
01:11:44,931 --> 01:11:46,471
Why did you make me do that?

1256
01:11:53,407 --> 01:11:54,240
Shit.

1257
01:11:57,418 --> 01:11:59,150
I didn't wanna do that.

1258
01:11:59,150 --> 01:11:59,983
I didn't...

1259
01:11:59,983 --> 01:12:00,816
I didn't.

Jacob.

1306
01:13:40,261 --> 01:13:42,461
I'm pretty sure you can
see me through this.

1307
01:13:43,381 --> 01:13:44,994
When I turn it on, anyway.

1308
01:13:46,081 --> 01:13:49,331
I don't see any other
cameras around here, so...

1309
01:13:50,391 --> 01:13:51,894
Listen, I just...

1310
01:13:51,894 --> 01:13:55,271
I just wanted to tell you
that I know what I did

1311
01:13:55,271 --> 01:13:57,384
was a really really shitty thing to do.

1312
01:13:59,091 --> 01:14:00,234
And I'm sorry.

1313
01:14:01,454 --> 01:14:02,287
I'm sorry.

1314
01:14:05,694 --> 01:14:07,114
I made a mistake.

1315
01:14:08,011 --> 01:14:09,884
Moms screw up sometimes.

1316
01:14:10,811 --> 01:14:12,164
And I screwed up.

1317
01:14:13,881 --> 01:14:15,861
And I know I should have told you.

1318
01:14:15,861 --> 01:14:17,611
I should have told you about Jerry.

1319
01:14:22,202 --> 01:14:23,035
He was 16.

1320
01:14:26,791 --> 01:14:30,270
Papa bought him this car,

1321
01:14:30,270 --> 01:14:33,021
this old beat up Mustang.

1322
01:14:33,021 --> 01:14:35,631
Jerry used to take me out in it for rides

1323
01:14:35,631 --> 01:14:39,071
with the windows down,
and the engine was so loud

1324
01:14:39,071 --> 01:14:41,674
it used to just drown out the whole world.

1325
01:14:42,751 --> 01:14:43,751
Nobody else existed.

1326
01:14:45,531 --> 01:14:46,784
Just him and me.

1327
01:14:48,891 --> 01:14:50,341
We all knew he was hurting.

1328
01:14:50,341 --> 01:14:53,361
He was keeping to himself a lot

1329
01:14:54,881 --> 01:14:56,664
and his eyes changed.

1330
01:14:57,721 --> 01:15:00,824
It's like they stopped looking.

1331
01:15:02,241 --> 01:15:03,454
They stopped seeing.

1332
01:15:05,563 --> 01:15:08,370
But you know, if you need
help, you ask for it.

1333
01:15:08,370 --> 01:15:13,324
That's how it worked in my
family and he didn't ask.

1334
01:15:15,937 --> 01:15:17,231
He didn't ask...

1335
01:15:19,663 --> 01:15:23,501
Then one day he took a
shotgun down to Bridge Creek

1336
01:15:23,501 --> 01:15:27,591
where all the kids would
be making out in their cars

1337
01:15:29,861 --> 01:15:31,414
and no one knows why he did it.

1338
01:15:35,061 --> 01:15:38,528
But all of a sudden he just
came flying out of that Mustang

1339
01:15:39,461 --> 01:15:41,074
and started shooting.

1340
01:15:43,281 --> 01:15:44,114
Kids.

1341
01:15:45,231 --> 01:15:46,064
Classmates.

1342
01:15:46,064 --> 01:15:47,819
Everybody; anybody.

1343
01:15:47,819 --> 01:15:49,173
No reason.

1344
01:15:49,173 --> 01:15:50,006
No reason.

1345
01:15:50,006 --> 01:15:52,244
Just because he could.

1346
01:15:54,930 --> 01:15:55,847
Seven kids.

1347
01:15:57,551 --> 01:15:58,384
Seven.

1348
01:16:00,888 --> 01:16:02,054
None of them survived.

1349
01:16:04,545 --> 01:16:05,974
He blew them to pieces.

1350
01:16:09,301 --> 01:16:10,251
And the thing is...

1351
01:16:13,801 --> 01:16:15,231
I didn't hate him so much

1352
01:16:15,231 --> 01:16:16,631
for killing those kids

1353
01:16:19,231 --> 01:16:21,371
as I did for putting a gun to his own head

1354
01:16:24,731 --> 01:16:26,921
before I had a chance to say goodbye...

1355
01:16:30,501 --> 01:16:33,324
Before I got one last
ride in that Mustang.

1356
01:16:41,201 --> 01:16:42,034
Well...

1357
01:16:44,341 --> 01:16:45,511
I was just a kid...

1358
01:16:46,761 --> 01:16:47,594
Barely 12.

1359
01:16:50,464 --> 01:16:52,594
But the thing is, honey,

1360
01:16:54,371 --> 01:16:55,264
sweetheart,

1361
01:16:57,251 --> 01:16:59,234
you are nothing like him.

1362
01:17:01,841 --> 01:17:05,064
You are nothing like Jerry.

1363
01:17:08,103 --> 01:17:10,794
You couldn't kill anybody, Jacob.

1364
01:17:12,878 --> 01:17:15,164
I know that; I know you can't.

1365
01:17:16,781 --> 01:17:18,381
You're not capable of it.

1366
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,734
I don't believe that you are.

1367
01:17:24,880 --> 01:17:27,297
I don't believe that you are.

1368
01:17:38,399 --> 01:17:39,899
I love you, honey.

1369
01:17:42,456 --> 01:17:44,206
Your mommy loves you.

1370
01:17:45,285 --> 01:17:46,118
I do.

1371
01:17:48,720 --> 01:17:49,970
I'm so sorry...

1372
01:17:54,009 --> 01:17:55,092
I'm so sorry.

1373
01:17:58,983 --> 01:17:59,816
Okay...

1374
01:18:26,760 --> 01:18:27,593
Jacob.

1375
01:18:30,610 --> 01:18:32,777
Jacob, honey, I'm thirsty.

1376
01:18:34,864 --> 01:18:36,941
Your mother needs some water.

1377
01:18:40,439 --> 01:18:41,514
I'll, um...

1378
01:18:43,294 --> 01:18:45,194
I'll turn my back to the door.

1379
01:19:20,840 --> 01:19:23,757
Please don't take my sunshine away.

1380
01:19:39,296 --> 01:19:41,379
What do you want from me?

1381
01:20:03,761 --> 01:20:05,245
-  Hey, Nana!

1382
01:20:05,245 --> 01:20:08,138
Yeah, yeah, mom's just taking a nap.

1383
01:20:08,138 --> 01:20:10,912
I'm sorry, I gotta run.
- Help!

1384
01:20:10,912 --> 01:20:11,745
Help!

1385
01:20:12,682 --> 01:20:15,432
Somebody help me!

1386
01:20:15,432 --> 01:20:16,762
He's gonna kill me!

1387
01:20:16,762 --> 01:20:18,872
He's gonna fucking kill me!

1388
01:20:18,872 --> 01:20:20,062
Help me!

1389
01:20:20,062 --> 01:20:21,260
Help!

1390
01:20:21,260 --> 01:20:23,143
Help, please, help me!

1391
01:20:23,143 --> 01:20:24,198
Help me!

1392
01:20:24,198 --> 01:20:25,641
Mom!

1393
01:20:25,641 --> 01:20:27,541
-  That was really stupid, mom.

1394
01:20:28,581 --> 01:20:29,414
- Jacob.

1395
01:20:33,302 --> 01:20:34,135
Jacob.

1396
01:20:35,231 --> 01:20:37,181
Jacob, you have to stop this right now.

1397
01:20:38,461 --> 01:20:39,911
How long have I been in here?

1398
01:20:41,181 --> 01:20:43,681
How long have I fucking
been in here, god damn it?

1399
01:20:47,221 --> 01:20:48,524
- Part two.

1400
01:20:53,045 --> 01:20:55,128
- I'm not gonna say that.

1401
01:20:56,495 --> 01:20:58,981
I'm not gonna say that.

1402
01:20:58,981 --> 01:20:59,921
-  I'm warning you.

1403
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:00,971
- No!

1404
01:21:00,971 --> 01:21:02,044
I'm warning you!

1405
01:21:04,033 --> 01:21:07,212
Is this what you want?

1406
01:21:07,212 --> 01:21:09,591
Is this how you want your movie to end?

1407
01:21:09,591 --> 01:21:10,841
- That's gonna hurt, mom.

1408
01:21:14,761 --> 01:21:15,594
Go ahead.

1409
01:21:16,651 --> 01:21:18,151
It's not gonna kill you.

1410
01:21:18,151 --> 01:21:19,560
It'll just, you know...

1411
01:21:25,881 --> 01:21:29,411
You're making this a lot more
difficult than it has to be.

1412
01:21:29,411 --> 01:21:32,721
Turn the camera off,
turn the camera back on,

1413
01:21:32,721 --> 01:21:36,251
say your lines, turn the
camera back off again.

1414
01:21:36,251 --> 01:21:37,281
That's it.

1415
01:21:37,281 --> 01:21:38,191
Ta-da!

1416
01:21:38,191 --> 01:21:39,304
No more closet.

1417
01:21:41,321 --> 01:21:43,261
- I don't believe you.

1418
01:21:43,261 --> 01:21:44,131
-  You're mumbling.

1419
01:21:44,131 --> 01:21:45,564
Talk into the camera.

1420
01:21:49,061 --> 01:21:50,348
- I don't believe you.

1421
01:21:54,891 --> 01:21:56,644
- Don't you get it?

1422
01:21:57,551 --> 01:22:00,003
I'm trying to fucking help you.

1423
01:22:00,003 --> 01:22:03,361
You were never supposed to
be in the closet this long.

1424
01:22:03,361 --> 01:22:04,366
That wasn't part of the plan!

1425
01:22:04,366 --> 01:22:07,024
That was not part of the plan!

1426
01:22:07,969 --> 01:22:08,802
Fuck...

1427
01:22:13,052 --> 01:22:13,885
- Oh!

1428
01:22:15,311 --> 01:22:16,521
No!

1429
01:22:16,521 --> 01:22:17,981
Oh, baby...

1430
01:22:17,981 --> 01:22:20,341
Sweetheart, you're sick.

1431
01:22:20,341 --> 01:22:21,174
You're sick...

1432
01:22:25,111 --> 01:22:27,074
You need help; it's not your fault.

1433
01:22:28,081 --> 01:22:29,294
It's not your fault.

1434
01:22:30,329 --> 01:22:31,234
I can help you.

1435
01:22:33,643 --> 01:22:35,972
Mommy can help you.

1436
01:22:35,972 --> 01:22:40,972
- You sure about that, mom?

1437
01:23:02,944 --> 01:23:05,680
- Somebody help me.

1438
01:23:05,680 --> 01:23:06,513
Please...

1439
01:23:08,174 --> 01:23:09,007
Help...

1440
01:23:10,558 --> 01:23:11,391
Help!

1441
01:23:12,404 --> 01:23:14,443
Somebody help me...

1442
01:23:14,443 --> 01:23:15,276
Help me?

1443
01:23:17,613 --> 01:23:18,446
Somebody?

1444
01:23:19,943 --> 01:23:21,360
Somebody help me.

1445
01:23:22,849 --> 01:23:23,682
Jacob...

1446
01:23:24,622 --> 01:23:25,455
Jacob.

1447
01:23:26,757 --> 01:23:27,590
Jacob.

1448
01:23:29,301 --> 01:23:30,218
Let me out.

1449
01:23:32,038 --> 01:23:33,121
Let me out...

1450
01:23:54,891 --> 01:23:55,724
Jacob?

1451
01:23:58,336 --> 01:23:59,169
Jacob?

1452
01:24:00,010 --> 01:24:01,224
- Mom?

1453
01:24:01,224 --> 01:24:02,804
- Look at my hands.

1454
01:24:04,701 --> 01:24:05,831
Look at them.

1455
01:24:05,831 --> 01:24:06,721
Why are they getting better?

1456
01:24:06,721 --> 01:24:07,771
Why are they healing?

1457
01:24:09,091 --> 01:24:10,741
What were you putting in my meds?

1458
01:24:19,441 --> 01:24:20,764
Listen, I have to ask you.

1459
01:24:21,846 --> 01:24:23,584
If I do this, if I say the lines,

1460
01:24:25,761 --> 01:24:26,661
you gonna kill me?

1461
01:24:29,074 --> 01:24:30,814
- I'm not gonna kill you, Mom.

1462
01:24:32,833 --> 01:24:34,133
I'm not gonna kill anyone.

1463
01:24:36,191 --> 01:24:37,024
You are.

1464
01:24:39,121 --> 01:24:40,754
Part two.

1465
01:24:42,948 --> 01:24:44,674
"Jacob's not going to kill me.

1466
01:24:45,648 --> 01:24:47,334
"He's not going to kill anyone.

1467
01:24:48,608 --> 01:24:49,441
"I am."

1468
01:25:02,901 --> 01:25:04,344
- Jacob's not gonna kill me.

1469
01:25:07,141 --> 01:25:08,704
Jacob's not gonna kill anyone.

1470
01:25:12,851 --> 01:25:13,684
I am.

1471
01:25:16,061 --> 01:25:18,254
- Pretty pathetic, mom.

1472
01:25:19,761 --> 01:25:22,578
Might even be worse than
your bullshit melodramatic

1473
01:25:22,578 --> 01:25:25,351
"Jerry never said goodbye" monologue.

1474
01:25:25,351 --> 01:25:27,285
Follow the directions.

1475
01:25:27,285 --> 01:25:32,285
Power off, power on, say
your lines, power off again.

1476
01:25:33,031 --> 01:25:35,184
And sit up already,
you look like a zombie.

1477
01:25:36,479 --> 01:25:38,174
- And then what?

1478
01:25:38,174 --> 01:25:42,211
- Then I transfer the
footage and I set an alarm.

1479
01:25:42,211 --> 01:25:43,261
When you hear the alarm,

1480
01:25:43,261 --> 01:25:45,361
that means you can come out of the closet.

1481
01:25:46,457 --> 01:25:47,801
- And then what?

1482
01:25:47,801 --> 01:25:48,721
- I don't know, mom.

1483
01:25:48,721 --> 01:25:50,421
I'll be at school by then.

1484
01:25:50,421 --> 01:25:51,711
I mean, the most obvious choice

1485
01:25:51,711 --> 01:25:53,861
would be to get up on
the stool and y'know.

1486
01:25:56,661 --> 01:25:57,494
- Jacob.

1487
01:25:58,891 --> 01:26:01,441
This movie is not gonna
end the way you want it to.

1488
01:26:02,601 --> 01:26:03,641
- Oh really?

1489
01:26:03,641 --> 01:26:04,824
How's it going to end?

1490
01:26:05,711 --> 01:26:08,814
- Jacob is going to let his
mother out of the closet.

1491
01:26:10,981 --> 01:26:13,534
He thinks it's too late
for that, but it's not.

1492
01:26:14,561 --> 01:26:17,384
And together, they are
going to erase the footage,

1493
01:26:18,635 --> 01:26:19,824
all of it.

1494
01:26:21,068 --> 01:26:22,111
- "They" are?

1495
01:26:22,111 --> 01:26:22,944
Hm...

1496
01:26:24,481 --> 01:26:26,671
What a snooze fest.

1497
01:26:26,671 --> 01:26:27,591
Okay, how 'bout this?

1498
01:26:27,591 --> 01:26:29,821
How about Jacob threatens to do

1499
01:26:29,821 --> 01:26:32,751
exactly what his mother
always feared he would do,

1500
01:26:32,751 --> 01:26:35,826
sort of like a
self-fulfilling prophecy or,

1501
01:26:35,826 --> 01:26:37,531
what did you call it?

1502
01:26:37,531 --> 01:26:39,261
A psychosomatic projection!

1503
01:26:39,261 --> 01:26:40,901
Dude, that's good, write that down.

1504
01:26:40,901 --> 01:26:43,288
Okay, so Jacob says something like,

1505
01:26:43,288 --> 01:26:44,121
"Hey, mom.

1506
01:26:44,121 --> 01:26:46,068
"Record your lines or I'm
gonna take a gun to school

1507
01:26:46,068 --> 01:26:48,468
"and mow down the entire freshman class."

1508
01:26:52,031 --> 01:26:53,691
C'mon, mom.

1509
01:26:53,691 --> 01:26:56,061
You don't want those kids
to end up like Jerry's pals,

1510
01:26:56,061 --> 01:26:56,894
do 'ya?

1511
01:26:58,237 --> 01:26:59,711
I'm totally kidding.

1512
01:26:59,711 --> 01:27:01,801
Look, there's nothing
really to negotiate here.

1513
01:27:01,801 --> 01:27:04,771
I mean we both know you're
gonna climb up on that stool.

1514
01:27:04,771 --> 01:27:06,071
I mean, how could you not?

1515
01:27:08,568 --> 01:27:10,554
"I'm the one who told Jerry to do it.

1516
01:27:10,554 --> 01:27:11,958
"I'm the psychopath."

1517
01:27:15,244 --> 01:27:17,541
Of course, if you don't have
the balls to go through with it

1518
01:27:17,541 --> 01:27:20,574
you could always watch this
little video I made for you.

1519
01:27:25,251 --> 01:27:28,151
Oh, and I'll have the drives
with me so don't even bother.

1520
01:27:31,771 --> 01:27:32,684
Say your lines.

1521
01:27:35,546 --> 01:27:36,534
Say your lines!

1522
01:27:39,121 --> 01:27:40,848
Mom, just say your lines.

1523
01:27:40,848 --> 01:27:43,264
Say your fucking lines!

1524
01:27:47,031 --> 01:27:47,961
- Jacob...

1525
01:27:50,141 --> 01:27:51,301
Jacob?

1526
01:27:51,301 --> 01:27:52,134
- Mom?

1527
01:27:54,211 --> 01:27:55,651
You scared me.

1528
01:27:55,651 --> 01:27:57,111
I thought you...

1529
01:27:57,111 --> 01:27:59,451
I don't know, I thought
something happened or...

1530
01:27:59,451 --> 01:28:00,384
Are you okay?

1531
01:28:01,581 --> 01:28:03,614
Your camera is faced the wrong way.

1532
01:28:05,541 --> 01:28:07,841
-  I'm not gonna do it.

1533
01:28:07,841 --> 01:28:09,714
I'm not gonna say the lines.

1534
01:28:11,171 --> 01:28:12,254
I'm sorry.

1535
01:28:17,556 --> 01:28:18,814
-  What the fuck?

1536
01:28:20,571 --> 01:28:22,424
- I can't let you get away with this.

1537
01:28:23,811 --> 01:28:25,501
-  What are you doing?

1538
01:28:25,501 --> 01:28:26,334
Mom, stop.

1539
01:28:26,334 --> 01:28:27,167
Don't!

1540
01:28:28,851 --> 01:28:29,684
- Goodbye, Jacob.

1541
01:28:29,684 --> 01:28:30,517
- Mom, don't--

1542
01:28:32,416 --> 01:28:33,249
Mom?

1543
01:28:34,232 --> 01:28:35,712
Mom?

1544
01:28:35,712 --> 01:28:36,545
Fuck!

1545
01:28:37,483 --> 01:28:38,508
Mom?

1546
01:28:38,508 --> 01:28:40,011
Mom, mom, mom...

1547
01:28:40,011 --> 01:28:42,701
Please, please, please...

1548
01:28:42,701 --> 01:28:44,240
Mom?

1549
01:28:44,240 --> 01:28:47,329
Why did you do that?

1550
01:28:47,329 --> 01:28:48,412
Okay, okay...

1551
01:28:54,470 --> 01:28:55,303
Fuck!

1552
01:29:03,024 --> 01:29:03,857
Fuck...

1553
01:29:13,728 --> 01:29:15,145
Okay, okay, okay.

1554
01:29:33,417 --> 01:29:34,250
Come on...

1555
01:29:52,836 --> 01:29:53,919
Shit, shit...

1556
01:29:54,884 --> 01:29:56,717
Think, think, think...

1557
01:29:58,377 --> 01:29:59,210
Think!

1558
01:30:05,911 --> 01:30:06,744
Nana!

1559
01:30:08,771 --> 01:30:09,611
Nana...

1560
01:30:12,522 --> 01:30:14,395
Nana, uh...

1561
01:30:14,395 --> 01:30:15,342
Nana.

1562
01:30:15,342 --> 01:30:16,831
Na-na...

1563
01:30:17,841 --> 01:30:19,861
Something's wrong with mom.

1564
01:30:19,861 --> 01:30:20,694
She, uh...

1565
01:30:22,364 --> 01:30:23,927
She's...

1566
01:30:23,927 --> 01:30:27,320
She's covered in wires
and something happened.

1567
01:30:27,320 --> 01:30:28,721
Her body is...

1568
01:30:30,559 --> 01:30:32,682
What the fuck is happening?

1569
01:30:32,682 --> 01:30:34,540
What the fuck is happening to me?

1570
01:30:34,540 --> 01:30:37,250
What the fuck is happening to me?

1571
01:30:37,250 --> 01:30:38,888
What the fuck is happening to me?

1572
01:30:38,888 --> 01:30:41,138
What the fuck is happening?

1573
01:31:17,982 --> 01:31:18,815
Mom?

1574
01:31:21,314 --> 01:31:22,397
-  Ah!

1575
01:31:31,946 --> 01:31:34,599
What's so fucking funny?

1576
01:31:34,599 --> 01:31:37,354
- You're
the baby in the pictures!

1577
01:31:39,621 --> 01:31:41,896
You're the baby with the knife!

1578
01:31:41,896 --> 01:31:42,956
- No I'm not.

1579
01:31:42,956 --> 01:31:43,931
I'm not!

1580
01:31:43,931 --> 01:31:45,611
I'm not the baby!

1581
01:31:45,611 --> 01:31:48,304
You're the fucking baby!

1582
01:33:07,351 --> 01:33:11,135
-  911,
what's your emergency?

1583
01:33:11,135 --> 01:33:11,968
911?

1584
01:33:14,285 --> 01:33:15,618
Is anyone there?

1585
01:33:18,266 --> 01:33:19,099
Hello?

1586
01:33:20,325 --> 01:33:21,551
Hello?

1587
01:33:21,551 --> 01:33:22,624
- My name is Abbey.

1588
01:33:26,281 --> 01:33:27,494
I'm a single mom,

1589
01:33:30,287 --> 01:33:32,204
and my son is a psychopath.

1590
01:33:33,641 --> 01:33:36,441
-  Are you in
any danger right now, Abbey?

1591
01:33:37,851 --> 01:33:39,371
- No.

1592
01:33:39,371 --> 01:33:41,321
-  Is your son in danger?

1593
01:33:42,961 --> 01:33:43,824
- I killed him.

1594
01:33:45,571 --> 01:33:46,648
I killed my son.

1595
01:33:50,089 --> 01:33:52,467
-  Is this a prank?

1596
01:33:52,467 --> 01:33:53,300
- No.

1597
01:33:54,930 --> 01:33:56,348
-  All right.

1598
01:33:56,348 --> 01:33:57,876
You said you killed your--

1599
01:33:57,876 --> 01:33:58,884
- Check the videos.

1600
01:34:01,370 --> 01:34:02,620
It's all there.

1601
01:34:04,073 --> 01:34:06,823
-  Okay, all right.

1602
01:34:08,368 --> 01:34:12,838
You're on East Wilcock, is that right?

1603
01:34:12,838 --> 01:34:13,671
Ma'am?

1604
01:34:17,378 --> 01:34:20,014
Ma'am, stay on the phone with me.

1605
01:34:22,420 --> 01:34:23,920
Stay on the phone.

1606
01:34:24,901 --> 01:34:27,956
Help is on the way, ma'am.

1607
01:34:27,956 --> 01:34:31,619
Stay on the phone with
me, help is on the way.

1608
01:34:31,619 --> 01:34:33,240
Ma'am?

1609
01:34:33,240 --> 01:34:34,407
Are you there?

1610
01:34:35,394 --> 01:34:37,702
Stay on the phone with me, ma'am.

1611
01:34:37,702 --> 01:34:39,285
Help is on the way.

1612
01:34:51,272 --> 01:34:52,511
-  Sike.

1613
01:34:52,511 --> 01:34:54,701
You didn't think I actually
wanted you to kill yourself,

1614
01:34:54,701 --> 01:34:55,961
did you?

1615
01:34:55,961 --> 01:34:59,381
Look, I saw that footage
and I freaked out.

1616
01:34:59,381 --> 01:35:00,721
Okay, I didn't know what to do

1617
01:35:00,721 --> 01:35:05,721
and I guess I just wanted
you to feel the way I felt.

1618
01:35:05,941 --> 01:35:06,774
Okay?

1619
01:35:06,774 --> 01:35:08,701
I know things went a little too far

1620
01:35:08,701 --> 01:35:11,514
and I didn't mean to hurt you and I'm...

1621
01:35:13,308 --> 01:35:14,141
