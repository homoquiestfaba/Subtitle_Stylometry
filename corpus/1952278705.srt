1
00:00:26,730 --> 00:00:30,371
You kill your film
several times.

2
00:00:30,372 --> 00:00:33,279
Mostly by talking about it.

3
00:00:34,672 --> 00:00:36,452
A film is a dream.

4
00:00:36,453 --> 00:00:40,445
You kill it writing it down,
you kill it with a camera,

5
00:00:40,446 --> 00:00:43,089
Your film might come to life
for a moment or two when

6
00:00:43,090 --> 00:00:44,090
your actors breathe
life back into it,

7
00:00:44,630 --> 00:00:48,577
But then it dies again,
buried in film cans.

8
00:00:49,144 --> 00:00:53,709
Mysteriously, sometimes,
in the editing room...

9
00:00:54,631 --> 00:00:57,579
a miracle happens when you place
one image next to another

10
00:00:57,595 --> 00:01:01,369
so that when finally an
audience sits in the dark

11
00:01:01,370 --> 00:01:04,875
if you're lucky, very lucky,

12
00:01:05,863 --> 00:01:09,227
and sometimes I've
been lucky

13
00:01:09,415 --> 00:01:12,636
the dream flickers back
to life again.

14
00:01:15,119 --> 00:01:17,802
That's why I'm secretive.

15
00:01:18,337 --> 00:01:22,261
So, what's your favorite pasta?

16
00:01:22,649 --> 00:01:24,897
Finally, a serious question.

17
00:01:24,998 --> 00:01:30,597

21
00:01:52,996 --> 00:01:55,717
Good luck, Maestro.

22
00:02:18,647 --> 00:02:22,075
Maestro, maestro, maestro.

23
00:02:22,892 --> 00:02:25,753
Maestro Contini

24
00:02:26,358 --> 00:02:28,891
How do you begin?

25
00:02:29,259 --> 00:02:32,067
How do you begin
this thing?

26
00:02:32,857 --> 00:02:36,759
Page one, page one,
page one...

27
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:41,019
Page nothing.

28
00:06:12,987 --> 00:06:17,021
- Guido, you're here.
- Buongiorno, Dante.

29
00:06:17,022 --> 00:06:18,917
I've been looking for you
all over the place.

30
00:06:18,918 --> 00:06:20,418
The set's coming along, eh?

31
00:06:20,419 --> 00:06:23,659
- How are you?
- Bene, grazie, bene.

32
00:06:23,660 --> 00:06:27,147
My God you look terrible.
Better go to makeup.

33
00:06:27,148 --> 00:06:29,508
Forgot you've got a
press conference?

34
00:06:29,509 --> 00:06:32,988
- He has no tie.
- Yes, makeup and wardrobe.

35
00:06:32,989 --> 00:06:35,717
- Signor Contini, I’m Fausto.
- He's counting cost.

36
00:06:35,718 --> 00:06:37,018
The bank wants him here.

37
00:06:37,019 --> 00:06:40,017
- Signor Contini.
- Don’t speak to him, I speak to him.

38
00:06:40,018 --> 00:06:44,253
Okay. I have some questions
for Signor Contini.

39
00:06:44,254 --> 00:06:45,779
You all have questions for
Signor Contini.

40
00:06:45,780 --> 00:06:47,254
Yes, but please.

41
00:06:47,255 --> 00:06:50,229
I think it's customary for
there to be an approved

42
00:06:50,230 --> 00:06:52,663
script and budget before
filming commence.

43
00:06:52,664 --> 00:06:55,744
- Is he going to follow us?
- It's not my intention to be difficult,

44
00:06:55,745 --> 00:06:58,364
I'm a huge admirer of
Maestro Contini's movies

45
00:06:58,365 --> 00:07:00,745
your early films are...
everybody loves them.

46
00:07:00,746 --> 00:07:03,293
And I consider it a great
honor for me to be here.

47
00:07:04,295 --> 00:07:06,980
But nonetheless, I need
a script and a budget

48
00:07:06,981 --> 00:07:09,017
- Where do you want your messages?
- On my desk.

49
00:07:09,018 --> 00:07:11,678
- There's no room on your desk.
- Under my desk. In the trash. Non lo so.

50
00:07:11,679 --> 00:07:14,477
Ciao, Paula.
Get me a cigarette.

51
00:07:14,745 --> 00:07:17,430
We will never be ready
to shoot in ten days.

52
00:07:17,431 --> 00:07:18,431
Jaconelli...

53
00:07:18,036 --> 00:07:19,604
- What? Not ready?
- Ascolta me.

54
00:07:19,605 --> 00:07:22,262
Be careful what you say.
He's a spy from the bank.

55
00:07:22,263 --> 00:07:24,370
He's not exactly
from the bank.

56
00:07:24,371 --> 00:07:25,834
You have actors waiting
for you in your office.

57
00:07:25,835 --> 00:07:26,805
You have auditions
all morning.

58
00:07:26,806 --> 00:07:30,421
You should see what I found.
I found two sisters...

59
00:07:36,827 --> 00:07:39,090
I need a cigarette.

60
00:07:39,091 --> 00:07:42,703
He needs a shirt
and a tie, Lilli.

61
00:07:43,131 --> 00:07:45,201
Answer the question
and I will give you a coffee

62
00:07:45,202 --> 00:07:46,202
Answer another, and I will
give you a cigarette.

63
00:07:48,107 --> 00:07:51,648
- Actually need an Aspirin.
- Calm down.

64
00:07:51,649 --> 00:07:55,104
Directing a movie is a very
overrated job, we all know it.

65
00:07:55,653 --> 00:07:58,960
You just have to say yes
or no. What else? Nothing.

66
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:01,488
"Should this be Red?" Yes.
"Green?" No

67
00:08:01,489 --> 00:08:03,489
"More extras?" Yes
"More lipstick?" No

68
00:08:03,490 --> 00:08:05,571
Yes. No. Yes. No.

69
00:08:05,609 --> 00:08:09,129
That's right: That's directing.

70
00:08:09,587 --> 00:08:13,347
It doesn't seem to make any
difference what the answer is.

71
00:08:13,348 --> 00:08:17,269
So, please, Guido, yes or no.

72
00:08:17,270 --> 00:08:20,025
Do you want costumes
in this film?

73
00:08:20,924 --> 00:08:23,445
- Yes.
- You see? Simple.

74
00:08:24,738 --> 00:08:27,941
Might I know what period
the movie is in?

75
00:08:29,182 --> 00:08:30,807
Soon.

76
00:08:31,361 --> 00:08:35,230
You know I don’t allow
producers in here.

77
00:08:36,286 --> 00:08:38,616
Two minutes Guido.

78
00:08:40,144 --> 00:08:42,225
He’s gone.

79
00:08:43,491 --> 00:08:45,992
Have you written
a word of the script?

80
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:47,659
No.

81
00:08:47,660 --> 00:08:49,541
Are you in a panic?

82
00:08:51,666 --> 00:08:52,530
Yes.

83
00:08:52,531 --> 00:08:54,428
Is Luisa going with you
to the Press Conference?

84
00:08:54,429 --> 00:08:58,573
No. Nobody.
Dante and his spy.

85
00:08:58,574 --> 00:09:00,973
You need to shave.
You look terrible.

86
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,454
Why is there no
fire escape in here?

87
00:09:03,455 --> 00:09:05,526
What if somebody
needed to escape?

88
00:09:05,527 --> 00:09:08,475
I can't face these reporters.
I have nothing to say.

89
00:09:08,476 --> 00:09:10,153
You'll be fine.

90
00:09:10,484 --> 00:09:13,383
You’re a world class
liar, darling.

91
00:09:13,669 --> 00:09:16,045
Go out there and
lie for Italy.

92
00:09:16,571 --> 00:09:19,320
Lie for Italia.

93
00:09:29,103 --> 00:09:31,491
What the hell is
wrong with me?

94
00:09:31,492 --> 00:09:34,769
I can't sleep, I can't think,
I can't write.

95
00:09:34,770 --> 00:09:37,768
I can't breathe.
My heart is racing.

96
00:09:37,769 --> 00:09:39,619
Am I dying, Mamma?

97
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:41,722
I owe you flowers, I know.

98
00:09:41,723 --> 00:09:44,497
I will come to the cemetery
at the weekend.

99
00:09:44,706 --> 00:09:47,577
You should have let me
bury you in Roma, Mamma.

100
00:09:47,578 --> 00:09:49,713
Could have visited you
every week.

101
00:09:51,137 --> 00:09:53,584
Don't look at me like that.

102
00:09:53,585 --> 00:09:56,765
Oh, Guido, Guido.

103
00:09:59,002 --> 00:10:01,450
This is your Rome, Guido.

104
00:10:01,451 --> 00:10:04,920
The world sees Rome the
way you invented it.

105
00:10:05,121 --> 00:10:07,933
Your films did that.

106
00:10:07,934 --> 00:10:10,995
- I miss you.
- I miss you too.

107
00:10:30,011 --> 00:10:34,317
We are just waiting for the
arrival of Contini any moment now

108
00:10:34,506 --> 00:10:37,466
Could this film put the
Maestro back on top?

109
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:41,841
And here he is!

110
00:10:46,261 --> 00:10:48,500
Thank you for coming.

111
00:10:48,501 --> 00:10:51,324
Silenzio, per favore.
Thank you, thank you.

112
00:10:51,325 --> 00:10:53,821
Guido Contini's long time
producer, is about to speak

113
00:10:53,822 --> 00:10:56,565
I just want to say a few
words from my heart.

114
00:10:56,566 --> 00:10:59,789
I am humbled and thrilled to
announce that I'm producing

115
00:10:59,790 --> 00:11:02,057
Guido Contini's next film:

116
00:11:02,058 --> 00:11:03,856
"Italia"

117
00:11:03,857 --> 00:11:08,443
which will star once again
Contini's longtime inspiration

118
00:11:08,444 --> 00:11:12,893
the international film star,
Claudia Jenssen.

119
00:11:14,504 --> 00:11:17,533
We start shooting in ten
days time in Cinecitta

120
00:11:17,534 --> 00:11:19,335
That makes it one week
from Monday.

121
00:11:19,336 --> 00:11:21,916
Thank you, Maestro,
thank you very much.

122
00:11:21,917 --> 00:11:25,476
This is our ninth film
together. Guido Contini.

123
00:11:25,477 --> 00:11:27,835
Thanks for coming, everybody.

124
00:11:30,928 --> 00:11:34,692
- Maestro Contini.
- Yes?

125
00:11:34,693 --> 00:11:40,677
Grazie. Your new film is
called Italia. Big title.

126
00:11:40,678 --> 00:11:42,605
Actually it's my shortest
title yet.

127
00:11:42,606 --> 00:11:46,690
- But hardly a modest one.
- Films are not modest.

128
00:11:46,691 --> 00:11:48,927
They cost too much,
they take too long,

129
00:11:48,928 --> 00:11:51,472
and they involve
too many people.

130
00:11:51,898 --> 00:11:54,474
They should have
grand titles.

131
00:11:54,475 --> 00:11:58,167
And might you tell the press
what the film is about?

132
00:11:58,168 --> 00:12:00,193
Why?

133
00:12:03,505 --> 00:12:05,392
I still don't know what my
last film was about.

134
00:12:05,393 --> 00:12:09,090
That was the problem.
Nobody else did.

135
00:12:10,172 --> 00:12:12,724
Of course I can tell you
what my film is about

136
00:12:12,725 --> 00:12:15,717
I can tell you the story,
I can tell you....

137
00:12:15,718 --> 00:12:17,853
who I am going to cast,
the music I want to use,

138
00:12:17,854 --> 00:12:21,991
I can tell you everything.
But I won't.

139
00:12:22,208 --> 00:12:25,827
I'm afraid that what I say
might leak to the press.

140
00:12:26,331 --> 00:12:29,538
Our next film will be
exactly as it sounds.

141
00:12:29,539 --> 00:12:30,839
Italia.

142
00:12:30,840 --> 00:12:35,493
It's the very spirit of Italy.
Italy as a myth, as a woman,

143
00:12:35,494 --> 00:12:36,974
Italy as a dream.

144
00:12:36,975 --> 00:12:41,341
- Is this true?
- Sounds fantastic. Can't wait to see it.

145
00:12:41,342 --> 00:12:43,847
Do you consider
pornography art?

146
00:12:44,943 --> 00:12:47,690
- Signor Contini.
- Stephanie.

147
00:12:47,691 --> 00:12:49,765
Could you tell the fashionable
women of America

148
00:12:49,766 --> 00:12:52,175
who your favorite
designer is?

149
00:12:52,210 --> 00:12:56,190
I'm less interested in wrapping
than what might be inside.

150
00:12:56,855 --> 00:12:59,645
Signor Contini, you are a
man of the world, yes?

151
00:12:59,646 --> 00:13:02,474
Educated in Britain,
a home in Biarritz.

152
00:13:02,475 --> 00:13:06,774
With Italia is it fair to say that
you’ve come home for good?

153
00:13:06,775 --> 00:13:09,780
It's been a long time since you
made a movie with your wife

154
00:13:09,781 --> 00:13:12,417
Do you plan on casting her
in this new film?

155
00:13:12,418 --> 00:13:14,824
I told Luisa that when we got
married I would never again

156
00:13:14,825 --> 00:13:15,825
make love to
my leading lady.

157
00:13:16,695 --> 00:13:20,069
But she hasn't worked at all
since working with you.

158
00:13:20,070 --> 00:13:23,904
But why are you being so
tight-lipped about this film?

159
00:13:23,905 --> 00:13:27,815
It’s a serious question.
What’s the big deal?

160
00:13:29,619 --> 00:13:32,124
I would like to be here.

161
00:13:32,996 --> 00:13:36,184
You want me to be serious
in a press conference?

162
00:13:36,185 --> 00:13:38,698
I would like to be there.

163
00:13:38,982 --> 00:13:42,664
I thought I was the
clown in this circus.

164
00:13:42,665 --> 00:13:46,225
I would like to be
everywhere at once

165
00:13:46,226 --> 00:13:49,166
I know that’s a
contradiction in terms

166
00:13:50,113 --> 00:13:53,051
Artists do their best work
before they're famous.

167
00:13:53,052 --> 00:13:54,918
Now you're famous.

168
00:13:54,919 --> 00:14:00,768
Without wishing to be negative,
your last two films, they were...

169
00:14:00,769 --> 00:14:01,424
Flops?

170
00:14:01,425 --> 00:14:02,866
Your word, flops.

171
00:14:02,867 --> 00:14:06,678
And it's a problem
especially when

172
00:14:06,679 --> 00:14:10,874
My body's nearing fifty,
as my mind is nearing...

173
00:14:10,875 --> 00:14:11,718
ten.

174
00:14:11,719 --> 00:14:15,908
I'm just asking if you're nervous.
You seem nervous.

175
00:14:15,909 --> 00:14:18,777
- Excuse me?
- What I'm asking, Maestro,

176
00:14:18,778 --> 00:14:22,791
is have you run out
of things to say?

177
00:14:22,792 --> 00:14:27,075
I can hardly stay up,
and I can't get to sleep.

178
00:14:27,076 --> 00:14:29,797
And I don’t want to wake
tomorrow morning

179
00:14:29,797 --> 00:14:31,749
at the bottom of some heap.

180
00:14:31,750 --> 00:14:35,031
But why take it
so seriously?

181
00:14:35,309 --> 00:14:39,566
After all, there's nothing
at stake here, only me.

182
00:14:39,913 --> 00:14:44,300
I want to be young.
I want to be old.

183
00:14:44,301 --> 00:14:47,174
I would like to be wise
before my time and yet

184
00:14:47,175 --> 00:14:48,676
be foolish and brash
and bold.

185
00:14:48,677 --> 00:14:51,617
I would like the universe to
get down on its knees and say:

186
00:14:51,618 --> 00:14:53,288
"Guido, whatever you please.

187
00:14:53,289 --> 00:14:58,236
It's okay even if it's impossible,
we'll arrange it."

188
00:15:01,274 --> 00:15:03,142
That's all that I want.

189
00:15:01,174 --> 00:15:03,042
That's all that I want.

190
00:15:03,043 --> 00:15:05,159
I was wondering if you think
there's a limit to what

191
00:15:05,160 --> 00:15:06,805
you can show in a movie.

192
00:15:06,806 --> 00:15:08,649
What would you
like to see,

193
00:15:08,650 --> 00:15:10,908
that I haven't already
shown you?

194
00:15:11,790 --> 00:15:16,315
I am lusting for more

195
00:15:16,316 --> 00:15:18,612
Should I settle for less?

196
00:15:18,613 --> 00:15:21,358
I ask you: What's a
good thing for if not for

197
00:15:21,359 --> 00:15:22,846
taking it to excess?

198
00:15:22,847 --> 00:15:26,281
One limitation
I dearly regret.

199
00:15:26,282 --> 00:15:31,165
There's one of me
I've ever met.

200
00:15:36,613 --> 00:15:38,270
If you have any
questions about...

201
00:15:38,271 --> 00:15:44,041
I would like to have another
me to travel along with myself

202
00:15:44,723 --> 00:15:50,722
I would even like to be able
to sing a duet with myself

203
00:15:51,768 --> 00:15:54,798
I would like to be here sing
along with myself in a song

204
00:15:54,799 --> 00:15:56,722
To be there walking
down a lane now

205
00:15:56,723 --> 00:15:58,509
Everywhere, everywhere,
everywhere

206
00:15:58,510 --> 00:16:00,423
That's a contradiction
in terms.

207
00:16:00,424 --> 00:16:02,034
I want to be here,
with a counter here

208
00:16:02,035 --> 00:16:06,201
melody in the here, top
of the morning to you Guido.

209
00:16:06,202 --> 00:16:10,124
Guido!
Guido!

210
00:16:10,125 --> 00:16:14,696
Guido. Me, me, me.
I want to be Proust

211
00:16:14,697 --> 00:16:16,756
or the marquis de Sade.

212
00:16:16,757 --> 00:16:19,235
I would like to be Christ,
Mohammed, Buddha

213
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:21,787
But not have to believe
in God, and you know

214
00:16:21,788 --> 00:16:24,937
I mean it with
all of my heart.

215
00:16:24,938 --> 00:16:29,491
It's the end if something
important doesn't start

216
00:16:29,492 --> 00:16:33,737
I want to be young,
but I have to be old

217
00:16:33,738 --> 00:16:36,442
What I want is a tale
of sound and fury,

218
00:16:36,443 --> 00:16:38,299
that some idiot
went and told.

219
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:41,304
I would like the universe to
get down on its knees and say:

220
00:16:41,305 --> 00:16:45,113
"Guido, whatever you please.
It's okay even if it’s ridiculous,

221
00:16:45,114 --> 00:16:47,697
we'll arrange it."

222
00:16:54,534 --> 00:16:58,420
So arrange it.

223
00:16:59,005 --> 00:17:03,221
<i>Arrange it.</i>

224
00:17:04,272 --> 00:17:06,887
That's all that I want.

225
00:17:15,411 --> 00:17:21,220
Guido, Guido, Guido!

226
00:17:22,906 --> 00:17:28,905
Guido, Guido, Guido!

227
00:17:35,171 --> 00:17:39,772
Contini, Contini, Contini

228
00:17:40,194 --> 00:17:43,580
Guido!

229
00:17:43,881 --> 00:17:47,978
Bellavista Spa Hotel
Anzio, Italy

230
00:17:50,929 --> 00:17:52,836
- I need a room.
- Of course.

231
00:17:52,837 --> 00:17:54,573
- A suite.
- Yes.

232
00:17:54,574 --> 00:17:59,563
With a view of the sea,
balcony. Something with air.

233
00:18:00,205 --> 00:18:03,240
All of our suites have air.

234
00:18:03,482 --> 00:18:06,548
- Let me just look for you.
- I come from Milano.

235
00:18:06,750 --> 00:18:10,201
- I understand.
- On business. I'm a business man.

236
00:18:10,202 --> 00:18:12,558
Busy busy busy.

237
00:18:12,593 --> 00:18:16,804
Would Maestro Contini prefer
to register under a pseudonym?

238
00:18:18,000 --> 00:18:19,472
Please.

239
00:18:19,473 --> 00:18:23,395
- Signor Milano?
- Why not.

240
00:18:23,396 --> 00:18:26,162
Needless to say,
I love your films.

241
00:18:26,163 --> 00:18:29,781
Guilty pleasure.
Those early films.

242
00:18:29,782 --> 00:18:31,182
Not the flops.

243
00:18:33,539 --> 00:18:37,140
I need to see a doctor. Do you
know one who's discreet?

244
00:18:37,141 --> 00:18:41,139
I'd like to see him today in
my room, now, if possible.

245
00:18:41,140 --> 00:18:45,329
Consider it done.
Please.

246
00:18:45,330 --> 00:18:48,556
And I need to place
a call. To my wife.

247
00:18:49,188 --> 00:18:51,020
Here.

248
00:18:51,021 --> 00:18:56,609
You can take the call at
the lobby phone over there.

249
00:18:56,610 --> 00:18:58,299
- Luisa? tesoro...
- There you are.

250
00:19:00,296 --> 00:19:02,227
Is everybody mad at me?

251
00:19:02,228 --> 00:19:05,409
Well I'm mad at you.
Where are you?

252
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:07,894
I had to escape from
the press conference.

253
00:19:07,895 --> 00:19:10,134
Oh, I heard. Dramatic.

254
00:19:10,135 --> 00:19:12,713
Don't tease me.
I'm sick, Luisa.

255
00:19:12,714 --> 00:19:16,846
You're making a film.
You make a film, you get sick.

256
00:19:16,847 --> 00:19:17,865
It's what happens.

257
00:19:17,866 --> 00:19:22,517
No but this time
I'm really sick.

258
00:19:22,744 --> 00:19:24,563
Are you by yourself?

259
00:19:24,564 --> 00:19:26,625
Yes, of course
I'm by myself.

260
00:19:26,626 --> 00:19:30,327
Then shall I come?
- Yes, that’s why I'm calling.

261
00:19:30,328 --> 00:19:33,195
Please come, straight away.
That would be wonderful.

262
00:19:33,196 --> 00:19:34,496
Okay.

263
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:38,428
Great. Marvelous.

264
00:19:38,870 --> 00:19:41,175
I don't know
where you are.

265
00:19:41,176 --> 00:19:45,648
I don't know. Some spa.
I just kept driving.

266
00:19:45,649 --> 00:19:48,691
I can't come if I don’t
know where you are.

267
00:19:48,692 --> 00:19:52,819
Actually, it’s hardly worth it.
I'll be back in a day or two.

268
00:19:53,409 --> 00:19:54,897
Yeah...

269
00:19:56,224 --> 00:19:58,914
Yes, it's hardly worth it.

270
00:19:59,167 --> 00:20:01,706
I do wish you were here.

271
00:20:02,000 --> 00:20:06,370
Get some rest.
Take the waters.

272
00:20:06,371 --> 00:20:10,827
Sleep. Then come back here
and make a good movie.

273
00:20:11,027 --> 00:20:12,734
I love you.

274
00:20:12,735 --> 00:20:15,435
Get better.

275
00:20:27,141 --> 00:20:30,792
Your doctor is
on his way.

276
00:20:30,793 --> 00:20:34,660
This number. If a woman
answers, put it through

277
00:20:34,661 --> 00:20:35,652
to my room.

278
00:20:35,687 --> 00:20:39,230
- Otherwise...
- Wrong number.

279
00:20:46,382 --> 00:20:48,570
What?

280
00:20:49,558 --> 00:20:51,397
- Dottore.
- Si?

281
00:20:54,226 --> 00:20:56,726
What is she whispering?
Is it about my blood pressure?

282
00:20:56,727 --> 00:21:00,692
- Is it serious? Am I dying?
- Stress, exhaustion,

283
00:21:00,693 --> 00:21:03,689
your liver, your heart,
your kidneys,

284
00:21:03,690 --> 00:21:06,601
They are all very cross
with you, Signore.

285
00:21:06,836 --> 00:21:09,922
- Open wide.
- Ahhhh.

286
00:21:09,923 --> 00:21:12,185
But you've come
to the right place.

287
00:21:12,186 --> 00:21:15,056
There are a dozen mineral
springs around the town.

288
00:21:15,057 --> 00:21:18,909
The Roman emperors
came here for the waters.

289
00:21:18,910 --> 00:21:22,786
Pronto.

290
00:21:22,787 --> 00:21:26,925
I was lazing about my
bedroom when you called

291
00:21:26,926 --> 00:21:30,654
and an idea occurred to me
I thought you might be...

292
00:21:31,213 --> 00:21:34,762
wondering about.

293
00:21:35,669 --> 00:21:37,266
Guido.

294
00:21:37,267 --> 00:21:40,009
It's a very important call,
doctor. I have to take it.

295
00:21:40,010 --> 00:21:42,391
- Private call.
- As you wish.

296
00:21:42,392 --> 00:21:47,277
Who's not wearing
any clothes?

297
00:21:47,278 --> 00:21:52,468
I’m not, my darling.

298
00:21:52,469 --> 00:21:57,209
Whose afraid to
kiss your toes?

299
00:21:57,210 --> 00:22:00,995
I'm not.

300
00:22:01,095 --> 00:22:04,855
Your mama dear

301
00:22:04,855 --> 00:22:09,773
is blowing into your ear

302
00:22:09,962 --> 00:22:14,784
so you'll get it
loud and clear

303
00:22:15,145 --> 00:22:19,139
I need you to
squeeze me

304
00:22:19,140 --> 00:22:21,178
here

305
00:22:21,179 --> 00:22:25,161
and here

306
00:22:25,562 --> 00:22:29,187
and here

307
00:22:29,188 --> 00:22:32,634
Dottore, his pulse,
it's racing.

308
00:22:32,635 --> 00:22:35,129
- Is something wrong?
- What?

309
00:22:35,504 --> 00:22:40,029
Yes, yes, it's about my film.
It's from the Vatican.

310
00:22:40,030 --> 00:22:44,865
Go ahead, Monsignore.
Of course I'm listening.

311
00:22:44,866 --> 00:22:49,349
cootchie cootchie
cootchie coo

312
00:22:49,745 --> 00:22:55,014
I've got a plan for

313
00:22:55,015 --> 00:22:59,729
what I'm gonna
do to you

314
00:23:00,025 --> 00:23:03,377
So hot

315
00:23:03,378 --> 00:23:06,972
you're gonna steam

316
00:23:06,973 --> 00:23:10,177
and scream,

317
00:23:10,178 --> 00:23:13,141
and vibrate like a

318
00:23:13,142 --> 00:23:16,087
string I'm plucking.

319
00:23:16,088 --> 00:23:21,040
Kiss your fevered
little brow

320
00:23:21,041 --> 00:23:25,225
pinch your cheeks
'til you say "Ow"

321
00:23:25,226 --> 00:23:27,862
And I can hardly wait

322
00:23:27,863 --> 00:23:31,458
to show you how,

323
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:34,223
Guido!

324
00:23:34,224 --> 00:23:35,424
Who won't care if you
come to me tired

325
00:23:38,425 --> 00:23:44,042
and overworked?
I won’t! Bambino.

326
00:23:44,043 --> 00:23:46,545
Who knows the therapy

327
00:23:46,546 --> 00:23:49,196
to beat what you can
get from me?

328
00:23:49,197 --> 00:23:54,646
I don't!

329
00:23:56,738 --> 00:24:02,171
But this will

330
00:24:02,172 --> 00:24:07,774
have to be enough
for now

331
00:24:10,945 --> 00:24:16,521
Guido!

332
00:24:21,727 --> 00:24:24,297
Ciao.

333
00:24:36,737 --> 00:24:40,782
I love you, Guido.

334
00:24:49,530 --> 00:24:51,222
Guido!

335
00:24:51,655 --> 00:24:54,712
Ciao!

336
00:24:56,053 --> 00:24:58,822
- Carla
- I'm so happy to see you!

337
00:24:58,823 --> 00:25:01,506
I missed you so much.

338
00:25:01,899 --> 00:25:04,198
- Are you happy I'm here?
- Of course.

339
00:25:04,199 --> 00:25:06,297
But very happy or
just a little happy?

340
00:25:06,298 --> 00:25:07,298
Very happy!

341
00:25:07,982 --> 00:25:10,446
What's wrong?
You look very tired!

342
00:25:10,447 --> 00:25:12,938
Carla, all those bags
for one weekend?

343
00:25:12,939 --> 00:25:16,054
Yes. Belavista is a very
fashionable place.

344
00:25:16,055 --> 00:25:19,127
You know I stayed there
with my parents. During the war.

345
00:25:19,128 --> 00:25:21,681
Carla, there's something
I have to tell you. Look.

346
00:25:21,682 --> 00:25:24,211
They found out who
I am at the hotel.

347
00:25:24,212 --> 00:25:27,673
- No.
- Yes, it's horrible.

348
00:25:27,674 --> 00:25:29,536
Obviously we don't want to
be followed by the press,

349
00:25:29,537 --> 00:25:32,373
I found the most charming
pensione for you,

350
00:25:32,374 --> 00:25:34,258
right here, it's charming.

351
00:25:34,569 --> 00:25:36,762
Here at the station?

352
00:25:48,201 --> 00:25:52,032
Close the curtains,
it's too light in here.

353
00:25:53,484 --> 00:25:56,851
- Perfect. Go to the corridor.
- What?

354
00:25:56,852 --> 00:25:59,406
Yes. Count to ten,
turn back in,

355
00:25:59,407 --> 00:26:00,968
pretend you're in
the wrong room

356
00:26:00,969 --> 00:26:03,777
and I'm a
complete stranger.

357
00:26:03,778 --> 00:26:06,311
I love your games.

358
00:26:07,975 --> 00:26:10,085
- I'm here on business.
- Okay.

359
00:26:10,086 --> 00:26:12,348
- Wait, wait, your face.
- What about it?

360
00:26:12,349 --> 00:26:14,157
Get your makeup.

361
00:26:18,830 --> 00:26:21,528
I had a nightmare
last night.

362
00:26:21,529 --> 00:26:24,973
We went into that little
ally behind Piazza Navona

363
00:26:24,974 --> 00:26:27,479
Where I bought you
that scarf, remember?

364
00:26:27,480 --> 00:26:30,092
- The same your wife bought
- Don't move, Carla.

365
00:26:30,093 --> 00:26:33,501
When you wear it I never
know if it's hers or mine.

366
00:26:33,502 --> 00:26:38,100
So we were there on the
ground, naked, kissing.

367
00:26:38,101 --> 00:26:39,804
We didn't care.

368
00:26:39,805 --> 00:26:42,755
And then my husband
arrived and killed us both.

369
00:26:42,756 --> 00:26:44,513
With a shovel.

370
00:26:45,110 --> 00:26:47,942
Poor Luigi. He would
never do that.

371
00:26:47,943 --> 00:26:49,075
He's so sweet.

372
00:26:49,075 --> 00:26:52,325
He speaks Latin. He knows
all the roman emperors.

373
00:26:52,326 --> 00:26:53,958
Good for him.

374
00:26:53,959 --> 00:26:57,930
Perhaps there is a job
for him in the movie.

375
00:26:57,931 --> 00:26:59,573
Why not?

376
00:26:59,574 --> 00:27:02,482
You could work
well together.

377
00:27:03,037 --> 00:27:04,766
Beautiful.

378
00:27:04,767 --> 00:27:09,754
When you come in I want
you to be my little savage.

379
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:11,752
- Yes.
- Go, go.

380
00:27:11,753 --> 00:27:14,790
You think I'm one of
your actresses?

381
00:27:18,141 --> 00:27:21,613
Oh! Madonna!

382
00:27:21,614 --> 00:27:22,614
I'll pretend to
be asleep.

383
00:27:25,075 --> 00:27:27,743
What if I really found
the wrong room?

384
00:27:27,744 --> 00:27:28,960
Would you be jealous?

385
00:27:28,961 --> 00:27:31,318
Would you do
such a thing?

386
00:27:31,319 --> 00:27:32,835
Who knows?

387
00:27:46,016 --> 00:27:47,657
What happened?

388
00:27:47,658 --> 00:27:50,455
It was the woman
from the hotel.

389
00:27:50,456 --> 00:27:52,793
She wanted to
give me towels.

390
00:27:53,991 --> 00:27:56,329
- Come here.
- Okay.

391
00:27:56,706 --> 00:27:58,429
- What?
- You are a stranger.

392
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:02,201
- I don't know you.
- Just come here.

393
00:28:02,442 --> 00:28:04,810
Be savage.

394
00:28:06,813 --> 00:28:09,362
Show me.

395
00:28:11,256 --> 00:28:13,817
Excuse me.

396
00:28:14,468 --> 00:28:17,285
I've got the wrong room.

397
00:28:17,782 --> 00:28:20,096
Yes you have.

398
00:28:20,691 --> 00:28:24,253
And I don't have the
faintest idea who you are.

399
00:28:41,596 --> 00:28:43,592
Page one.

400
00:28:43,593 --> 00:28:46,430
Page one, page one,
page one.

401
00:28:46,631 --> 00:28:51,363
The figure emerges from
the darkness, like a goddess.

402
00:28:51,364 --> 00:28:54,631
She's Claudia, his muse.

403
00:28:54,632 --> 00:28:58,475
She takes the man’s face
and kisses him.

404
00:28:58,476 --> 00:29:03,399
And with that gesture he's
suddenly inspired to write

405
00:29:03,400 --> 00:29:07,395
something... profound.

406
00:29:10,241 --> 00:29:13,657
Mother of God,
give me a sign.

407
00:29:35,243 --> 00:29:37,673
- Excuse me, father.
- Buongiorno.

408
00:29:37,674 --> 00:29:40,236
- His Excellency, the Cardinal...
- Signor Contini!

409
00:29:40,237 --> 00:29:41,525
I'm a big fan!

410
00:29:41,526 --> 00:29:43,661
I would very much like
to speak to the cardinal

411
00:29:43,662 --> 00:29:46,713
Is Claudia Jensen
with you?

412
00:29:47,410 --> 00:29:49,078
- No.
- Pity.

413
00:29:49,079 --> 00:29:52,001
His Excellency is a big admirer
of Signorina Jenssen.

414
00:29:52,002 --> 00:29:54,899
I’m in need of some guidance,
some pointers...

415
00:29:54,900 --> 00:29:57,261
Do you think you can
find a signed photograph

416
00:29:57,262 --> 00:29:59,169
of Signorina Jenssen?

417
00:29:59,463 --> 00:30:01,919
- For His Excellency?
- Si.

418
00:30:02,507 --> 00:30:06,425
- I'm sure it would be possible.
- Truly? What a pleasure.

419
00:30:06,426 --> 00:30:09,746
Arrivederci, Maestro.

420
00:30:10,696 --> 00:30:14,866
Guido! Guidino!

421
00:30:15,094 --> 00:30:17,208
I'm not going to ask
how you find me.

422
00:30:17,209 --> 00:30:20,509
Please, it's my job. A producer
needs to know where his

423
00:30:20,510 --> 00:30:22,700
director is at all times.

424
00:30:22,701 --> 00:30:25,572
Even to know the pensione
where his mistress is staying.

425
00:30:25,573 --> 00:30:27,984
- Oh my God.
- I understand, Guido.

426
00:30:27,985 --> 00:30:31,597
Rome is absolutely unbearable.
The pressure.

427
00:30:31,598 --> 00:30:33,554
- It's not good.
- Really, you understand?

428
00:30:33,555 --> 00:30:35,957
Of course I understand.
Absolutely.

429
00:30:35,958 --> 00:30:38,624
You're not going to
drag me back?

430
00:30:38,625 --> 00:30:41,676
You're a genius and
genius must be served.

431
00:30:41,677 --> 00:30:44,873
Thank you my old friend.
Where are we going?

432
00:30:44,874 --> 00:30:47,471
You can't be in Rome?
Okay.

433
00:30:47,672 --> 00:30:50,341
Rome will come to you.

434
00:30:51,466 --> 00:30:54,574
It's a fantastic place
for you to focus.

435
00:30:54,575 --> 00:30:57,520
Everyone is here
to help the movie.

436
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,668
Everyone is here because
they love you, Guido.

437
00:31:01,952 --> 00:31:03,533
Look, with the flower
and the grass

438
00:31:03,534 --> 00:31:07,120
and with the arches of
the empire. Roman empire.

439
00:31:09,136 --> 00:31:10,257
You remember Donatella?

440
00:31:10,292 --> 00:31:11,924
- Ciao.
- Ciao.

441
00:31:11,925 --> 00:31:15,159
- Donatella, you tested her.
- I was very nervous

442
00:31:15,160 --> 00:31:19,164
He probably doesn't remember.
I was quite nervous.

443
00:31:19,165 --> 00:31:24,778
No, I remember you. We all
enjoyed you, so to speak.

444
00:31:24,779 --> 00:31:26,948
Maestro!

445
00:31:26,949 --> 00:31:29,147
Claudia's agent.

446
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:32,192
Did she like the script?

447
00:31:32,389 --> 00:31:35,400
No, no no no.
Impossibile.

448
00:31:35,401 --> 00:31:37,511
Are you telling me she
didn't get the script?

449
00:31:37,512 --> 00:31:41,094
Pierpaulo!
Claudia didn't get the script!

450
00:31:41,095 --> 00:31:43,221
Send her another one, for
Christ sake. Send her two!

451
00:31:43,222 --> 00:31:44,855
- Yes, I'm sorry.
- Cretino!

452
00:31:44,856 --> 00:31:46,394
Right now.

453
00:31:46,828 --> 00:31:48,262
Yes, that's what I say.

454
00:31:48,263 --> 00:31:50,880
People just don't realize she's
an actress as well as a star.

455
00:31:50,881 --> 00:31:55,273
I know Dante's dying to
talk to you. A dolpo. Ciao!

456
00:31:55,574 --> 00:31:56,874
Lombardo.

457
00:32:04,882 --> 00:32:06,710
What are we doing here?

458
00:32:07,127 --> 00:32:10,003
I'm happy. I brought
my swimsuit.

459
00:32:11,423 --> 00:32:13,555
It was Luisa's
birthday yesterday.

460
00:32:13,556 --> 00:32:17,978
What? No!
Oh please God, no.

461
00:32:17,979 --> 00:32:21,400
I spoke with her yesterday,
she didn't even mention it.

462
00:32:21,656 --> 00:32:25,164
- Give me a cigarette.
- What's that?

463
00:32:28,134 --> 00:32:30,539
- What's that?
- It's for Claudia.

464
00:32:30,540 --> 00:32:31,655
For which scene?

465
00:32:31,656 --> 00:32:34,233
I don't know which scene,
until I've seen the script.

466
00:32:34,234 --> 00:32:35,671
But she always likes
something like this,

467
00:32:35,672 --> 00:32:37,252
- Or you do.
- Looks like Folies Bergere,

468
00:32:37,253 --> 00:32:39,253
It's wrong. Italian women
don't wear those things.

469
00:32:39,254 --> 00:32:41,069
Don't knock the
Folies Bergere.

470
00:32:41,070 --> 00:32:43,436
It brings back happy
memories, that's where I...

471
00:32:43,437 --> 00:32:48,480
learned my art. All those
sequins, all those feathers.

472
00:32:48,755 --> 00:32:50,944
And you're wrong.

473
00:32:50,944 --> 00:32:52,364
You put Claudia in
one of these for that

474
00:32:52,365 --> 00:32:55,074
nightclub scene in
"Natura Morta".

475
00:32:55,638 --> 00:32:57,802
Why do people
love that film?

476
00:32:57,803 --> 00:33:01,311
Oh, Guido.
Don't, that's death.

477
00:33:01,312 --> 00:33:02,945
Every time we have to
start again.

478
00:33:02,946 --> 00:33:04,373
I'm trying to find it.

479
00:33:04,373 --> 00:33:05,531
You won’t find it with
your head jammed

480
00:33:05,532 --> 00:33:07,483
halfway up your arse.

481
00:33:08,220 --> 00:33:10,282
Ashtray.

482
00:33:10,555 --> 00:33:13,420
You were saying my head
is jammed up my arse.

483
00:33:13,421 --> 00:33:14,721
Halfway.

484
00:33:14,722 --> 00:33:18,575
I don't know. Why not dream
up something entertaining?

485
00:33:18,576 --> 00:33:21,641
Something with music.
With dancing.

486
00:33:21,928 --> 00:33:25,276
God knows we could use
a little "joie de vivre".

487
00:33:27,190 --> 00:33:31,238
Le Cinema today
is in a crisis.

488
00:33:31,239 --> 00:33:35,314
The directors are so
existentialistes.

489
00:33:35,647 --> 00:33:39,917
The movies are not worth
their entrance prices

490
00:33:40,199 --> 00:33:44,229
If no one sings a love song
when he's kissed.

491
00:33:44,721 --> 00:33:50,672
Love cannot be love
without "Le Singing",

492
00:33:50,900 --> 00:33:55,619
A string, a clarinet
a saxophone.

493
00:33:55,898 --> 00:34:00,352
Take a lesson from
this old Parisienne and

494
00:34:00,751 --> 00:34:06,750
the finest entertainment
she has known.

495
00:34:09,172 --> 00:34:14,955
Folies Bergere

496
00:34:16,001 --> 00:34:20,754
What a showing of color,
costume and dancing.

497
00:34:20,976 --> 00:34:25,159
Not a moment in life
could be more entrancing.

498
00:34:25,774 --> 00:34:30,833
Than an evening you
spend aux Folies Bergere.

499
00:34:31,136 --> 00:34:35,369
Folies Bergere.

500
00:34:35,370 --> 00:34:39,817
Not a soul in the world
could be in despair

501
00:34:40,204 --> 00:34:44,721
when he is glancing

502
00:34:44,977 --> 00:34:49,870
at the fabulous stage
des Folies Bergere

503
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:56,019
FOLIES BERGERE

504
00:34:56,765 --> 00:35:01,145
LA MUSIQUE, LA DANSE, LE
SON, LA LUMIERE!

505
00:35:01,503 --> 00:35:05,804
LES PETITS JOLIES SEINS DES
BELLES BOUQUETIERES

506
00:35:06,031 --> 00:35:10,594
SUR LA BELLE PASSARELLE DES
FOLIES BEREGERE,

507
00:35:10,868 --> 00:35:14,901
PAS DE MYSTERE

508
00:35:14,902 --> 00:35:19,206
LE SPECTACLE EST TOUT A
FAIT DECOUVERT.

509
00:35:19,440 --> 00:35:23,212
"ET PAS TROP CHER"

510
00:35:23,940 --> 00:35:28,250
VIENS CE SOIR AVEC MOI
AUX FOLIES BERGERE.

511
00:35:28,504 --> 00:35:31,962
Bon soir, bon soir,
bon soir.

512
00:35:31,963 --> 00:35:35,908
Je suis la vedette
des Folies Bergere.

513
00:35:36,734 --> 00:35:39,567
Vedette, it means "star".

514
00:35:40,123 --> 00:35:41,506
Let me tell you:

515
00:35:41,507 --> 00:35:44,774
Last night I looked
down at this table

516
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:45,979
in the chairs you are
sitting in now

517
00:35:45,980 --> 00:35:47,976
and what do I see?

518
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:51,003
A priest!
And next to him?

519
00:35:53,443 --> 00:35:57,561
Mon Dieu. Guido?
Guido Contini?

520
00:35:57,562 --> 00:36:00,403
What are you doing here
at the Folies Bergere?

521
00:36:00,404 --> 00:36:03,900
You naughty boy!
You're only nine years old!

522
00:36:03,901 --> 00:36:05,558
But I'm glad
you've come.

523
00:36:06,359 --> 00:36:08,334
Would you like to
join me on stage?

524
00:36:08,335 --> 00:36:11,634
Yes, come!
Come, come, come!

525
00:36:12,793 --> 00:36:14,727
Feeling better?

526
00:36:14,728 --> 00:36:16,247
There's no room for
hopelessness here,

527
00:36:16,248 --> 00:36:17,622
is there, Guido?

528
00:36:17,623 --> 00:36:20,785
We must explain something
to our young Guido.

529
00:36:21,038 --> 00:36:23,859
What do we want?
Laughter!

530
00:36:24,260 --> 00:36:26,945
What do we want?
Love!

531
00:36:27,346 --> 00:36:30,930
What do we want?
Dreams!

532
00:36:31,851 --> 00:36:34,144
Let us not forget,
Guido, mon cher,

533
00:36:34,145 --> 00:36:37,527
that is our privilege:
To entertain!

534
00:36:37,562 --> 00:36:40,144
Folies Bergere

535
00:36:40,145 --> 00:36:43,556
The music, the lights
and the laughter.

536
00:36:43,557 --> 00:36:46,878
The answer to what
you are after.

537
00:36:46,879 --> 00:36:50,799
Each night at the
Folies Bergere.

538
00:36:51,046 --> 00:36:53,544
Folies Bergere

539
00:36:53,545 --> 00:36:57,440
By the heavens above
you will swear

540
00:36:57,771 --> 00:37:01,175
there's nothing rarer.

541
00:37:01,176 --> 00:37:07,045
Than the Folies Bergere.

542
00:37:08,840 --> 00:37:14,471
Folies Bergere

543
00:37:14,758 --> 00:37:18,045
The stage overflowing
and giving

544
00:37:18,046 --> 00:37:21,337
a musical reason
for living

545
00:37:21,338 --> 00:37:25,148
each night at the
Folies Bergere.

546
00:37:25,486 --> 00:37:28,063
Folies Bergere

547
00:37:28,064 --> 00:37:32,041
To your modern
ideas I compare

548
00:37:32,382 --> 00:37:35,758
one derriere

549
00:37:35,759 --> 00:37:40,453
at the Folies Bergere

550
00:37:40,454 --> 00:37:43,858
The answer to what
you are after

551
00:37:43,859 --> 00:37:47,771
The music, the lights
and the laughter

552
00:37:48,314 --> 00:37:54,313
of the Follies Berger!

553
00:38:57,368 --> 00:39:00,353
The Cardinal is
right this way.

554
00:39:04,287 --> 00:39:08,260
Your Eminence,
Signor Contini is here.

555
00:39:19,323 --> 00:39:22,740
I like Charlie Chaplin.

556
00:39:23,410 --> 00:39:25,108
Me too.

557
00:39:25,109 --> 00:39:26,721
A genius.

558
00:39:28,170 --> 00:39:30,577
What can I do for you?

559
00:39:32,387 --> 00:39:35,413
- Do you believe in God?
- Signor Contini, please.

560
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:38,532
No, no, it's an
honest question.

561
00:39:38,533 --> 00:39:42,736
- Yes, I believe in God.
- So do I.

562
00:39:42,737 --> 00:39:44,586
Are you a catholic?

563
00:39:45,526 --> 00:39:49,781
Yes, very much so. Not as
much as I would like to be.

564
00:39:49,782 --> 00:39:52,013
Not as much as you would
like me to be, I’m sure,

565
00:39:52,014 --> 00:39:55,386
but certainly yes,
I'm trying.

566
00:39:55,387 --> 00:40:00,052
- Try harder.
- Yes, I will.

567
00:40:00,053 --> 00:40:03,514
Your Eminence...

568
00:40:04,704 --> 00:40:06,941
I'm not happy,

569
00:40:06,942 --> 00:40:09,328
I'm searching for something.

570
00:40:09,328 --> 00:40:11,617
I feel a sense of misery,
of despair...

571
00:40:11,618 --> 00:40:17,094
I saw your films. Not the flops,
the others, the good ones.

572
00:40:17,095 --> 00:40:20,951
But you think people need
to see so much sex?

573
00:40:20,952 --> 00:40:22,674
It's not necessary.

574
00:40:22,999 --> 00:40:26,266
We can all imagine.

575
00:40:26,681 --> 00:40:30,726
Excuse me. My films
are what I imagine.

576
00:40:30,727 --> 00:40:34,933
Then your imagination
has no moral training.

577
00:40:34,934 --> 00:40:37,004
How do you train
the imagination?

578
00:40:37,005 --> 00:40:41,192
Imagination is
God's garden.

579
00:40:41,193 --> 00:40:44,048
Don’t let the Devil
play in it.

580
00:40:44,049 --> 00:40:49,227
Teach our Italian women
to be wives, not whores.

581
00:40:49,228 --> 00:40:52,897
Don't make us look at
filth and debauchery.

582
00:40:52,898 --> 00:40:56,796
Make us proud
to be Italian.

583
00:41:04,301 --> 00:41:08,180
Pesaro
Italy 1926

584
00:41:09,312 --> 00:41:12,435
Guido!

585
00:41:14,080 --> 00:41:15,604
The money,
the money.

586
00:41:20,084 --> 00:41:22,635
- Let's go.
- Guido, go!

587
00:41:23,856 --> 00:41:25,427
Saraghina.

588
00:41:25,428 --> 00:41:30,647
Saraghina!

589
00:42:34,667 --> 00:42:38,162
So you little
Italian devils...

590
00:42:38,607 --> 00:42:42,501
You want to know
about love?

591
00:42:42,702 --> 00:42:45,589
Saraghina will tell you.

592
00:42:45,850 --> 00:42:49,082
If you want to make
a woman happy

593
00:42:49,300 --> 00:42:52,786
You rely on what
you were born with.

594
00:42:53,011 --> 00:42:56,844
Because it is in
your blood.

595
00:42:58,009 --> 00:43:02,670
Be Italian.

596
00:43:03,124 --> 00:43:06,150
Be Italian.

597
00:43:06,522 --> 00:43:12,074
Take a chance and try
to steal a fiery kiss.

598
00:43:13,334 --> 00:43:16,546
Be Italian.

599
00:43:17,047 --> 00:43:19,967
Be Italian.

600
00:43:20,257 --> 00:43:23,764
When you hold me,
don't just hold me

601
00:43:23,765 --> 00:43:27,181
but hold this!

602
00:43:32,545 --> 00:43:37,282
Please be gentle,

603
00:43:37,641 --> 00:43:40,749
sentimental,

604
00:43:41,212 --> 00:43:46,875
go ahead and try to
give my cheek a pat.

605
00:43:47,862 --> 00:43:51,401
But be daring

606
00:43:51,402 --> 00:43:54,936
and uncaring.

607
00:43:54,937 --> 00:43:58,437
When you pinch me
try to pinch me

608
00:43:58,438 --> 00:43:59,738
where there's fat!

609
00:44:02,623 --> 00:44:05,328
Be a singer,

610
00:44:05,329 --> 00:44:08,558
be a lover.

611
00:44:08,825 --> 00:44:14,824
Pick the flower now
before the chance is past.

612
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:18,517
Be Italian

613
00:44:18,750 --> 00:44:21,707
Be Italian.

614
00:44:22,008 --> 00:44:27,915
Live today as if it may
become your last!

615
00:46:06,878 --> 00:46:11,866
Be a singer,

616
00:46:13,888 --> 00:46:17,542
Be a lover.

617
00:46:17,543 --> 00:46:23,543
Pick the flower now
before the chance is past.

618
00:46:24,712 --> 00:46:27,713
Be Italian.

619
00:46:28,514 --> 00:46:31,451
Be Italian.

620
00:46:31,652 --> 00:46:34,972
Live today as
if it may

621
00:46:34,973 --> 00:46:37,234
become

622
00:46:37,235 --> 00:46:43,234
your last.

623
00:46:49,747 --> 00:46:53,480
Guido!

624
00:47:24,671 --> 00:47:26,590
I'm ashamed
of you, Guido.

625
00:47:26,591 --> 00:47:28,819
Mamma,
what did I do?

626
00:47:28,820 --> 00:47:30,739
Bring him here.

627
00:47:31,124 --> 00:47:35,363
That savage
is the devil.

628
00:47:35,364 --> 00:47:39,424
God will punish you for
your sins now and forever.

629
00:47:54,251 --> 00:47:56,189
What?

630
00:47:58,190 --> 00:48:01,370
- What?
- I can't breathe.

631
00:48:03,839 --> 00:48:06,416
Guido, don't die on me.
Can you imagine.

632
00:48:06,679 --> 00:48:09,442
Poor Luigi!
It would kill him.

633
00:48:09,690 --> 00:48:12,230
If I die it would
kill your husband?

634
00:48:12,562 --> 00:48:16,871
No, that's not what
I meant, Guidino. No.

635
00:48:17,436 --> 00:48:19,302
- Where are you going?
- I have to go to work.

636
00:48:19,303 --> 00:48:20,603
Carla, I can't breathe!

637
00:48:21,163 --> 00:48:23,196
- Let me come with you.
- It's impossible.

638
00:48:23,197 --> 00:48:25,034
- Why?
- Because it's impossible!

639
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:27,201
- Please!
- Why is it impossible?

640
00:48:27,202 --> 00:48:28,202
Look at your producer.

641
00:48:28,974 --> 00:48:31,072
He's married, he brings
his girlfriend to work

642
00:48:31,073 --> 00:48:32,831
and nobody cares.

643
00:48:32,832 --> 00:48:34,520
Guido, everybody
knows about me.

644
00:48:34,521 --> 00:48:35,937
Why, why won't you
let me near you?

645
00:48:35,938 --> 00:48:37,659
For the very same reason
you don’t want me to

646
00:48:37,660 --> 00:48:39,482
die on top of you. It's
not fair to your husband.

647
00:48:39,483 --> 00:48:40,669
- It's not fair to my wife!
- You're playing with me.

648
00:48:41,727 --> 00:48:44,223
You're twisting
everything.

649
00:48:44,561 --> 00:48:47,299
Please let me
come with you.

650
00:48:49,411 --> 00:48:53,242
I'll be here, waiting for
you, with my legs open.

651
00:48:55,125 --> 00:48:58,875
DIMMI QUANDO

652
00:48:59,148 --> 00:49:03,061
TU VERRAI

653
00:49:03,401 --> 00:49:08,039
DIMMI QUANDO
QUANDO QUANDO

654
00:49:08,681 --> 00:49:12,722
Let's say there were
ten sequences,

655
00:49:12,723 --> 00:49:15,078
each one set in a
different period,

656
00:49:15,079 --> 00:49:20,177
but played by the
same cast.

657
00:49:20,508 --> 00:49:22,727
Something light
and hectic,

658
00:49:22,728 --> 00:49:25,171
like Mozart would
do it, like Figaro.

659
00:49:25,172 --> 00:49:27,325
- Like the circus.
- Claudia will be amazing.

660
00:49:27,326 --> 00:49:30,997
- Sounds like a masterpiece.
- He hasn't written a word.

661
00:49:30,998 --> 00:49:35,370
A screenplay is first of
all a map. That's a map.

662
00:49:35,371 --> 00:49:38,405
Let's try to dig for
something else.

663
00:49:38,406 --> 00:49:42,149
Maybe a group of people
digging, in the desert.

664
00:49:49,095 --> 00:49:51,006
Luisa?

665
00:49:54,596 --> 00:49:56,380
Is that his wife?

666
00:49:56,640 --> 00:49:58,651
I can't believe
you came.

667
00:49:58,652 --> 00:50:01,641
The jungle drums said
it was an emergency.

668
00:50:01,642 --> 00:50:05,139
The jungle drums
exaggerated just a tiny bit.

669
00:50:05,140 --> 00:50:07,557
Not entirely.

670
00:50:07,779 --> 00:50:10,203
You haven't
been sleeping.

671
00:50:10,956 --> 00:50:14,369
I was dying,
until just now.

672
00:50:14,370 --> 00:50:15,688
Come.

673
00:50:20,562 --> 00:50:22,417
Don't think I forgot
your birthday.

674
00:50:22,418 --> 00:50:26,380
When you get home, the
house will be full of flowers.

675
00:50:26,597 --> 00:50:29,824
- Am I already going home?
- I hope not.

676
00:50:30,376 --> 00:50:33,073
Happy Birthday,
my darling.

677
00:50:38,825 --> 00:50:42,161
- Here she is. At last.
- Buona Sera.

678
00:50:42,162 --> 00:50:44,663
Magnificent.

679
00:50:44,936 --> 00:50:47,762
- You know Donatella?
- I do now.

680
00:50:52,138 --> 00:50:55,504
- Thank you for calling.
- You're saving the movie.

681
00:50:55,884 --> 00:50:58,172
Give him a good idea
for God's sake.

682
00:50:58,173 --> 00:51:00,660
Let's drink a toast
to Luisa's birthday.

683
00:51:00,661 --> 00:51:03,881
- Happy Birthday!
- It was Monday.

684
00:51:04,567 --> 00:51:07,080
- Happy Birthday!
- Thank you.

685
00:51:07,081 --> 00:51:09,266
Happy Birthday.

686
00:51:11,154 --> 00:51:14,198
- Maestro.
- Ah, Don Mario.

687
00:51:14,199 --> 00:51:16,392
Excuse me, darling,
this is Don Mario.

688
00:51:16,393 --> 00:51:17,800
This is my wife, Luisa.

689
00:51:17,801 --> 00:51:21,089
- A pleasure, Signora.
- Sit down, won't you?

690
00:51:21,090 --> 00:51:24,645
- Please. Please.
- Thanks. Buona Sera.

691
00:51:26,585 --> 00:51:29,844
I was telling your husband
how much I admire his movies.

692
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:33,474
Publicly, the church condemns
them. We have to.

693
00:51:33,475 --> 00:51:35,426
But we all love them.

694
00:51:35,427 --> 00:51:38,461
Last year we did our own
version of your "Il Vicolo"

695
00:51:38,462 --> 00:51:39,462
at the Christmas Party.

696
00:51:39,440 --> 00:51:42,887
- That I'd pay to see.
- Luisa was in that film.

697
00:51:42,888 --> 00:51:44,866
She was the best
thing in the movie.

698
00:51:44,867 --> 00:51:46,167
It's true. It was
your first part.

699
00:51:48,074 --> 00:51:51,334
Of course. You are
Luisa Acari. Oh my Lord!

700
00:51:51,335 --> 00:51:52,635
I was.

701
00:51:53,225 --> 00:51:55,269
You can't stop
being somebody.

702
00:51:55,576 --> 00:51:57,317
Can't you?

703
00:51:57,318 --> 00:52:00,750
Well there's a good catholic
wife for you, Guido.

704
00:52:00,751 --> 00:52:04,466
That's what they do:
Sacrifice.

705
00:52:04,467 --> 00:52:06,424
Still, Signora Contini...

706
00:52:06,425 --> 00:52:09,289
it must be a very
exciting life for you.

707
00:52:10,064 --> 00:52:15,025
My husband makes movies

708
00:52:15,559 --> 00:52:19,764
To make them he lives
a kind of dream.

709
00:52:20,395 --> 00:52:25,059
In which his actions aren't
always what they seem.

710
00:52:25,779 --> 00:52:30,572
He may be on to some
unique romantic theme.

711
00:52:32,222 --> 00:52:36,680
Some men run banks.
Some rule the world.

712
00:52:37,293 --> 00:52:41,324
Some earn their living
baking bread.

713
00:52:42,212 --> 00:52:46,819
My husband he goes
a little crazy

714
00:52:47,405 --> 00:52:53,204
making movies instead.

715
00:52:53,700 --> 00:52:58,162
My husband spins fantasies.

716
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:03,123
He lives them then
gives them to you all.

717
00:53:04,064 --> 00:53:08,532
Like Michelangelo he
paints his private dome.

718
00:53:09,369 --> 00:53:14,771
But can't distinguish what's
his work and what's his home.

719
00:53:16,167 --> 00:53:20,875
Some men sell stocks.
Some men punch clocks.

720
00:53:21,745 --> 00:53:25,762
Some leap where others
fear to tread.

721
00:53:26,598 --> 00:53:31,229
My husband as author
and director

722
00:53:31,953 --> 00:53:37,256
makes up stories
in his head.

723
00:53:54,682 --> 00:53:58,487
Guido Contini,
Luisa Contini,

724
00:53:58,785 --> 00:54:02,445
Number one genius
and number one fan.

725
00:54:03,019 --> 00:54:06,536
Guido Contini,
Luisa Contini,

726
00:54:06,904 --> 00:54:10,709
Passionate woman
in love with this man.

727
00:54:10,710 --> 00:54:14,484
Long ago.

728
00:54:16,034 --> 00:54:19,252
Many years ago.

729
00:54:19,817 --> 00:54:22,550
Once we two were

730
00:54:22,551 --> 00:54:26,237
Guido Contini,
Luisa his lover,

731
00:54:26,462 --> 00:54:30,091
actress with dreams
and a life of her own.

732
00:54:30,530 --> 00:54:34,482
Then we had no end
of world to discover,

733
00:54:34,483 --> 00:54:38,354
Singing together all
night on the phone.

734
00:54:38,355 --> 00:54:41,723
Long ago.

735
00:54:42,715 --> 00:54:46,462
Someone else ago.

736
00:54:48,067 --> 00:54:50,842
Signorina Acari,
per favore.

737
00:54:52,203 --> 00:54:55,762
Provino numero uno.
Luisa Acari.

738
00:54:56,022 --> 00:54:58,233
Your name is Italian.

739
00:54:58,233 --> 00:55:01,654
My father is Italian.
My mother is French.

740
00:55:02,199 --> 00:55:04,157
What have you
done before?

741
00:55:04,158 --> 00:55:05,733
I've waited.

742
00:55:05,734 --> 00:55:08,649
Waited for this?

743
00:55:10,420 --> 00:55:13,066
Waited tables.

744
00:55:13,356 --> 00:55:17,590
And, of course, I studied
theater and mime in Paris.

745
00:55:18,351 --> 00:55:22,052
But mostly
waited tables.
