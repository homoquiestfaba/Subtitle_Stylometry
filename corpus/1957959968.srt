(dog barking)
(birds chirping)

17
00:03:11,023 --> 00:03:12,173
- I gotta go, I'm late.

18
00:03:17,880 --> 00:03:19,590
Good luck on your first
day of school, honey.

19
00:03:19,590 --> 00:03:20,943
I'm sorry I can't take you.

20
00:03:22,365 --> 00:03:24,003
I know it's gonna be great.

21
00:03:28,470 --> 00:03:29,303
And don't worry,

22
00:03:29,303 --> 00:03:30,470
things are gonna get better.

(gentle music)
(birds chirping)

26
00:03:56,017 --> 00:03:57,030
- [David] Hey, Riordan.

27
00:03:57,030 --> 00:03:58,260
- [Riordan] Yo, what's up, David?

28
00:03:58,260 --> 00:03:59,746
- [David] Check this out.

29
00:03:59,746 --> 00:04:01,770
- [Riordan] Aw, man. (chuckles)

30
00:04:01,770 --> 00:04:02,693
What is it?

31
00:04:04,913 --> 00:04:06,160
(suspenseful music)

32
00:04:06,160 --> 00:04:07,440
- Hey, that's that new kid.

33
00:04:07,440 --> 00:04:09,570
- He just moved into Roach Motel.

34
00:04:09,570 --> 00:04:11,400
- Where'd he get those clothes?

35
00:04:11,400 --> 00:04:13,479
Salvation Army?

36
00:04:13,479 --> 00:04:15,152
- [Riordan] Yeah, he's stupid.

37
00:04:15,152 --> 00:04:18,985
(suspenseful music continues)

38
00:04:19,839 --> 00:04:21,322
- [David] Gotcha!

39
00:04:21,322 --> 00:04:22,500
- [Riordan] I got you too.

40
00:04:22,500 --> 00:04:23,746
(David and Riordan laughing)

41
00:04:23,746 --> 00:04:24,658
- [David] Did you hit that fool?

42
00:04:24,658 --> 00:04:27,322
- [Riordan] I got him, man.

43
00:04:27,322 --> 00:04:29,905

(door squeaks)

47
00:04:46,869 --> 00:04:47,702
- Okay.

48
00:04:47,702 --> 00:04:49,448
Those with the blue cards,

49
00:04:49,448 --> 00:04:51,031
go to the 200 room.

50
00:04:51,967 --> 00:04:55,366
And those with the yellow cards,

51
00:04:55,366 --> 00:04:57,008
go the, um...

52
00:04:57,008 --> 00:04:58,112
Wait a minute. Wait a minute.

53
00:04:58,112 --> 00:05:01,317
Those with the yellow
cards, go to the 200 room.

54
00:05:01,317 --> 00:05:04,317
Hey, you guys, you're not listening.

55
00:05:05,190 --> 00:05:07,773
(gentle music)

56
00:05:11,381 --> 00:05:12,471
- Hey, come on!

57
00:05:12,471 --> 00:05:14,042
Cut it out. Cut it out.

58
00:05:14,042 --> 00:05:14,918
Cut it out.

59
00:05:14,918 --> 00:05:16,111
Cut it out.

60
00:05:16,111 --> 00:05:17,286
All of you.

61
00:05:17,286 --> 00:05:18,933
(school children clamoring)

62
00:05:18,933 --> 00:05:19,766
Hold on.

63
00:05:20,609 --> 00:05:22,361
Whoa, off of him.

64
00:05:22,361 --> 00:05:23,991
Easy, easy, easy.

65
00:05:23,991 --> 00:05:28,008
(school children clamoring)

66
00:05:28,008 --> 00:05:30,591
(gentle music)

67
00:05:52,771 --> 00:05:55,688
(class chattering)

68
00:06:09,907 --> 00:06:12,490
(gentle music)

69
00:06:23,683 --> 00:06:25,320
- What do you think you're doing?

70
00:06:25,320 --> 00:06:26,493
It's my seat, punk.

71
00:06:27,720 --> 00:06:28,553
- I don't think so.

72
00:06:28,553 --> 00:06:29,490
Find another one.

73
00:06:29,490 --> 00:06:30,323
- Oh yeah?

74
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,300
- Look, it's the first day of school,

75
00:06:33,300 --> 00:06:34,750
nobody is assigned seats yet.

76
00:06:37,800 --> 00:06:40,083
- It's gonna be your last day, punk.

77
00:06:42,840 --> 00:06:43,673
- Hi, Clyde?

78
00:06:43,673 --> 00:06:44,506
- What's up?

79
00:06:44,506 --> 00:06:45,339
- The seat's mine.

80
00:06:45,339 --> 00:06:46,707
Back off, Psycho.

81
00:06:46,707 --> 00:06:49,830
(class chattering)

82
00:06:49,830 --> 00:06:51,450
- Sure, Clyde. I hear you.

83
00:06:51,450 --> 00:06:52,950
Didn't know it was yours, pal.

84
00:06:57,450 --> 00:06:59,190
- Tough guy, ain't you?

85
00:06:59,190 --> 00:07:00,836
- He's not so big.

86
00:07:00,836 --> 00:07:02,160
(Clyde chuckles)

87
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:04,510
- Well, they don't call
him Psycho for nothing.

88
00:07:06,150 --> 00:07:07,200
- I didn't know that.

89
00:07:09,240 --> 00:07:10,790
- You got guts in my book, kid.

90
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:12,930
What's your name?

91
00:07:12,930 --> 00:07:13,763
- Billy.

92
00:07:15,185 --> 00:07:16,500
- You're new here?

93
00:07:16,500 --> 00:07:17,950
- [Billy] Moved in last week.

94
00:07:20,400 --> 00:07:21,483
- Well, Billy boy,

95
00:07:23,714 --> 00:07:25,914
I think you got what
it takes to be Pack 13.

96
00:07:27,243 --> 00:07:28,293
- Pack 13?

97
00:07:29,359 --> 00:07:32,160
- Yeah, my boys,

98
00:07:32,160 --> 00:07:32,993
my colors.

99
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,833
- Why don't you come and hang with me?

100
00:07:37,820 --> 00:07:38,763
- I, I don't know.

101
00:07:39,780 --> 00:07:41,130
- What? What's the problem?

102
00:07:41,130 --> 00:07:42,150
- No problem.

103
00:07:42,150 --> 00:07:44,973
Uh, I just don't think
I need to be in a gang.

104
00:07:47,105 --> 00:07:49,079
(Clyde scoff)

105
00:07:49,079 --> 00:07:49,912
- Yeah, right.

106
00:07:49,912 --> 00:07:50,913
Right, right, right.

107
00:07:52,320 --> 00:07:53,673
Suit yourself, tough guy.

108
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,963
- Don't you want your chair back?

109
00:07:57,963 --> 00:08:00,324
(class chattering)

110
00:08:00,324 --> 00:08:03,330
- Nah, I can find my own.

111
00:08:03,330 --> 00:08:04,303
- Thanks.

112
00:08:04,303 --> 00:08:07,220
(class chattering)

113
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:10,522
- Up.

114
00:08:11,871 --> 00:08:14,788
(class chattering)

115
00:08:27,761 --> 00:08:29,586
- Hey, you guys, settle down.

116
00:08:29,586 --> 00:08:30,419
Come on.

117
00:08:30,419 --> 00:08:32,100
We don't have much time for the...

118
00:08:32,100 --> 00:08:33,751
So how are you guys doing?

119
00:08:33,751 --> 00:08:34,585
- [Class] Good.

120
00:08:34,585 --> 00:08:37,059
- Did you have a good summer?
Come on, I can't hear you.

121
00:08:37,059 --> 00:08:38,061
Did you have a good summer?

122
00:08:38,061 --> 00:08:38,894
- [Class] Yes.

123
00:08:38,894 --> 00:08:40,080
(overlapping chatter)

124
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:41,100
- How are you doing, Beth?

125
00:08:41,100 --> 00:08:42,450
Do you all know about this guy here,

126
00:08:42,450 --> 00:08:43,590
he made to the state finals?

127
00:08:43,590 --> 00:08:44,489
Big hand.

128
00:08:44,489 --> 00:08:47,160
(class cheering and applauding)

129
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,530
Clyde, so are you gonna
join us for another year?

130
00:08:49,530 --> 00:08:50,760
- Yes, ma'am.

131
00:08:50,760 --> 00:08:53,610
- Well, another year isn't
gonna kill any of us.

132
00:08:53,610 --> 00:08:54,443
Is it?

133
00:08:55,380 --> 00:08:57,893
I'm gonna see to it that
you get it right this year.

134
00:08:59,670 --> 00:09:01,920
Oh, we have a new student.

135
00:09:01,920 --> 00:09:03,030
Let's see.

136
00:09:03,030 --> 00:09:03,863
You are?

137
00:09:05,400 --> 00:09:06,900
- Billy.

138
00:09:06,900 --> 00:09:08,250
Billy McCluskey.

139
00:09:08,250 --> 00:09:09,240
- [Teacher] Well, Billy,
why don't you stand up

140
00:09:09,240 --> 00:09:11,541
so we can have a look at you?

141
00:09:11,541 --> 00:09:13,260
It says here you're from Michigan.

142
00:09:13,260 --> 00:09:14,298
Where in Michigan?

143
00:09:14,298 --> 00:09:15,270
- Mattawan.

144
00:09:15,270 --> 00:09:16,500
- Mattawan?

145
00:09:16,500 --> 00:09:17,610
Where's that?

146
00:09:17,610 --> 00:09:18,960
- Near Detroit.

147
00:09:18,960 --> 00:09:19,920
- [Teacher] Oh.

148
00:09:19,920 --> 00:09:21,450
Well, is there anything
you'd like to tell us

149
00:09:21,450 --> 00:09:22,710
about yourself?

150
00:09:22,710 --> 00:09:24,050
Hobbies or...

151
00:09:26,400 --> 00:09:27,870
- No.

152
00:09:27,870 --> 00:09:28,950
- [Teacher] Do you have
any brothers or sisters

153
00:09:28,950 --> 00:09:30,360
at the school?

154
00:09:30,360 --> 00:09:31,610
- Can I sit down, please?

155
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:33,653
- Well, I'll tell you what,

156
00:09:33,653 --> 00:09:35,363
you answer my question,
I'll think about it.

157
00:09:37,500 --> 00:09:40,290
- No, no brothers, no sisters, no family,

158
00:09:40,290 --> 00:09:41,550
just me and my mom.

159
00:09:41,550 --> 00:09:42,840
Can I sit down, please?

160
00:09:42,840 --> 00:09:44,490
- [Teacher] Yeah.

161
00:09:44,490 --> 00:09:45,330
Okay, people.

162
00:09:45,330 --> 00:09:47,190
Well, we have another new year here,

163
00:09:47,190 --> 00:09:49,470
and that means we start
the year off with a-

164
00:09:49,470 --> 00:09:50,610
- [All] Clean slate.

165
00:09:50,610 --> 00:09:52,140
- Yeah, you got the drill.

166
00:09:52,140 --> 00:09:53,850
Now, some of you guys,
you've been doing great.

167
00:09:53,850 --> 00:09:54,720
That's good.

168
00:09:54,720 --> 00:09:56,020
You keep up the good work.

169
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:59,460
Well, why don't some of you
other people look at this as a,

170
00:09:59,460 --> 00:10:01,140
as an opportunity to get back up there

171
00:10:01,140 --> 00:10:03,120
and make a change for the better?

172
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,320
I know you have a lot on your minds.

173
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,370
It's the first day of school

174
00:10:05,370 --> 00:10:07,470
so it all seems a bit overwhelming,

175
00:10:07,470 --> 00:10:08,520
but I really want you to know

176
00:10:08,520 --> 00:10:10,560
that there's always
somebody here to help you.

177
00:10:10,560 --> 00:10:13,124
The hard part is you're just
gonna have to ask for it.

178
00:10:13,124 --> 00:10:13,957
(bell ringing)

179
00:10:13,957 --> 00:10:16,050
Okay, I'll see most of
you in my history class,

180
00:10:16,050 --> 00:10:17,520
third period.

181
00:10:17,520 --> 00:10:19,140
Oh, you know, by the way,
the walls have been cleaned,

182
00:10:19,140 --> 00:10:21,933
so why don't you leave the
creativity to the art class?

183
00:10:26,310 --> 00:10:27,726
Good luck.

184
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:30,893
(spray paint hissing)

185
00:10:43,812 --> 00:10:47,250
(suspenseful music)

186
00:10:47,250 --> 00:10:50,907
- Well, well, well, it's the fresh meat.

187
00:10:50,907 --> 00:10:53,280
This is Snakes' territory, B.

188
00:10:53,280 --> 00:10:54,600
Snakes only.

189
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:55,983
Don't you know nothing.

190
00:10:57,330 --> 00:10:59,610
You're gonna have to pay a toll.

191
00:10:59,610 --> 00:11:01,083
So what's he gonna be?

192
00:11:02,640 --> 00:11:04,923
Bills or blood?

193
00:11:06,034 --> 00:11:07,440
- I, I,

194
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,520
I don't got any money.

195
00:11:08,520 --> 00:11:10,220
- I was hoping you would say that.

196
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:15,433
(suspenseful music continues)

197
00:11:29,050 --> 00:11:31,530
(Billy thuds)

198
00:11:31,530 --> 00:11:33,060
Come on, come out.

199
00:11:33,060 --> 00:11:33,960
I'm not gonna hurt you.

200
00:11:33,960 --> 00:11:35,415
Come out, come on.

201
00:11:35,415 --> 00:11:39,248
(suspenseful music continues)

202
00:11:42,986 --> 00:11:44,232
Come on, get up.

203
00:11:44,232 --> 00:11:45,065
Come on.

204
00:11:45,065 --> 00:11:46,680
Don't make this too easy on me.

205
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:47,983
Come on, don't make-

206
00:11:52,127 --> 00:11:54,450
- So you don't any help, huh, tough guy?

207
00:11:54,450 --> 00:11:56,700
- This is Snakes' territory, Clyde.

208
00:11:56,700 --> 00:11:57,570
You know the line.

209
00:11:57,570 --> 00:11:59,973
- So what you gonna make out of it, Dice?

210
00:12:02,640 --> 00:12:03,473
Shall we go?

211
00:12:18,413 --> 00:12:20,863
You had him up against
the ropes, huh, tough guy?

212
00:12:22,080 --> 00:12:23,340
- The name's Billy.

213
00:12:23,340 --> 00:12:24,173
- Yeah, I know.

214
00:12:24,173 --> 00:12:25,770
What the hell were you
doing in there anyways?

215
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:27,060
- What I normally doing in a bathroom.

216
00:12:27,060 --> 00:12:28,256
I had to go.

217
00:12:28,256 --> 00:12:29,145
(Clyde chuckles)

218
00:12:29,145 --> 00:12:31,230
- Oh boy, do you have a lot to learn.

219
00:12:31,230 --> 00:12:32,400
That's the Snakes' turf,

220
00:12:32,400 --> 00:12:33,270
you can't go in there.

221
00:12:33,270 --> 00:12:34,750
- [Billy] But where am I supposed to go?

222
00:12:34,750 --> 00:12:37,923
- Well, with no colors, little man, home.

223
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,050
- So how's about, uh,

224
00:12:40,050 --> 00:12:42,100
I take you to meet the boys after school?

225
00:12:43,110 --> 00:12:45,510
- Sure, I guess.

226
00:12:45,510 --> 00:12:46,740
- All right, guy.

227
00:12:46,740 --> 00:12:48,390
Meet me at the basketball courts.

228
00:12:55,710 --> 00:12:56,543
- Cool.

229
00:12:57,532 --> 00:13:00,115
(gentle music)

230
00:13:11,643 --> 00:13:13,200
(school children chattering)

231
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,604
- Hey, who wants to take my place?

232
00:13:14,604 --> 00:13:15,523
You wanna take my place?

233
00:13:15,523 --> 00:13:16,356
- Oh, no.

234
00:13:18,193 --> 00:13:21,706
(boy speaking faintly)

235
00:13:21,706 --> 00:13:25,123
(gentle music continues)

236
00:13:26,367 --> 00:13:27,303
- Hi, Billy!

237
00:13:32,010 --> 00:13:33,273
Hi, I'm Toni.

238
00:13:35,640 --> 00:13:36,473
- Hi.

239
00:13:37,950 --> 00:13:39,983
- Well, welcome to Central Middle School.

240
00:13:43,110 --> 00:13:44,280
It's okay.

241
00:13:44,280 --> 00:13:45,630
I know how you feel.

242
00:13:45,630 --> 00:13:48,180
I was the new kid on the block last year.

243
00:13:48,180 --> 00:13:49,140
This place looks tough,

244
00:13:49,140 --> 00:13:50,640
but you'll get the hang of it.

245
00:13:52,440 --> 00:13:53,273
- I hope so.

246
00:13:54,600 --> 00:13:55,433
- Well...

247
00:13:59,010 --> 00:14:01,810
Well, some of my friends are...

248
00:14:01,810 --> 00:14:05,750
Well, well, some of my friends are, uh...

249
00:14:09,060 --> 00:14:10,950
Some of my friends are forming a committee

250
00:14:10,950 --> 00:14:12,508
for the kick of it.

251
00:14:12,508 --> 00:14:14,908
Do you wanna come over
to my house and help out?

252
00:14:16,070 --> 00:14:16,923
- A party, Toni?

253
00:14:17,910 --> 00:14:19,593
Me and the boys, we'd love to.

254
00:14:20,430 --> 00:14:22,233
- Don't even dream about it, scuzz!

255
00:14:23,250 --> 00:14:24,360
He a friend of yours?

256
00:14:24,360 --> 00:14:26,913
- What-
- To the end, Toni.

257
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:29,940
(school children chattering)

258
00:14:29,940 --> 00:14:30,790
- That's too bad.

259
00:14:39,990 --> 00:14:41,420
- What are you tryna do to me?

260
00:14:41,420 --> 00:14:42,570
- Hey, who, tiger.

261
00:14:42,570 --> 00:14:44,280
Down, boy, down.

262
00:14:44,280 --> 00:14:47,370
Just trying to save you from
a lifetime of misery and pain.

263
00:14:47,370 --> 00:14:49,533
- I can make my own decisions, okay?

264
00:14:50,669 --> 00:14:51,502
(Clyde scoff)

265
00:14:51,502 --> 00:14:54,540
- Now, why on earth would I
let you do something like that?

266
00:14:54,540 --> 00:14:57,630
You'll cheer up once you meet my boys.

267
00:14:57,630 --> 00:15:00,360
- [Bill] I know about colors
and stuff, from my dad.

268
00:15:00,360 --> 00:15:01,620
- Ah, you're smarter than to listen

269
00:15:01,620 --> 00:15:03,863
to all that parental bull, ain't you?

270
00:15:03,863 --> 00:15:05,000
- No, I mean, you don't understand-

271
00:15:05,000 --> 00:15:06,180
- 'Cause, you know,

272
00:15:06,180 --> 00:15:08,880
all that crap that they
tell you is whacked.

273
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,150
I mean, "Our babies are getting
murdered in the streets.

274
00:15:12,150 --> 00:15:13,443
They're drug runners."

275
00:15:13,443 --> 00:15:15,750
Drug runners, can you believe that?

276
00:15:15,750 --> 00:15:19,680
And then they run to their
precious booze and pills.

277
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:20,973
Hypocrites, all of them.

278
00:15:21,840 --> 00:15:23,730
You know, the only place
you can get respect

279
00:15:23,730 --> 00:15:25,530
is on the streets;

280
00:15:25,530 --> 00:15:28,830
and if you don't have it,
you don't have anything.

281
00:15:28,830 --> 00:15:30,524
- Hey, it's mama's boy.

282
00:15:30,524 --> 00:15:32,220
- Yeah, that's the dork from Detroit.

283
00:15:32,220 --> 00:15:34,070
- [Clyde] Hey, this is Billy.

284
00:15:34,070 --> 00:15:36,120
He wants to be in the Pack.

285
00:15:36,120 --> 00:15:36,953
- What, man?

286
00:15:36,953 --> 00:15:38,418
- No, way, Clyde.

287
00:15:38,418 --> 00:15:40,617
- Hey, I'm a big dog here,

288
00:15:40,617 --> 00:15:42,063
and I vote we take him in.

289
00:15:43,920 --> 00:15:45,330
- On a trial basis, Clyde.

290
00:15:45,330 --> 00:15:47,310
Hey, we don't know if this kid can hang.

291
00:15:47,310 --> 00:15:48,360
- [Riordan] Yeah, man

292
00:15:50,250 --> 00:15:52,165
- On the trial basis then, okay?

293
00:15:52,165 --> 00:15:52,998
- Yeah.

294
00:15:52,998 --> 00:15:55,307
'Cause if he can't run with the wild dogs,

295
00:15:55,307 --> 00:15:56,340
(gang barking)

296
00:15:56,340 --> 00:15:58,410
stay on the porch.

297
00:15:58,410 --> 00:16:00,454
So we gots to be cool.

298
00:16:00,454 --> 00:16:03,573
(suspenseful music)

299
00:16:03,573 --> 00:16:04,830
- It's okay, Clyde.

300
00:16:04,830 --> 00:16:07,200
I mean, it's not that important.

301
00:16:07,200 --> 00:16:09,930
- Hey, just say the word, Billy boy,

302
00:16:09,930 --> 00:16:11,853
and we'll jump you in.

303
00:16:13,830 --> 00:16:15,496
Come here. You'll be part of a family.

304
00:16:15,496 --> 00:16:17,400
We'll always be there for you.

305
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:18,233
- Trial basis-

306
00:16:18,233 --> 00:16:19,560
- Hey, check this out.

307
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:22,020
We own everything from
the middle of that bridge

308
00:16:22,020 --> 00:16:22,853
to Avenue A.

309
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:25,103
- Own?

310
00:16:26,310 --> 00:16:29,040
- Oh yeah. It's more like a lease.

311
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,300
- From who?

312
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:31,133
- From them.

313
00:16:32,133 --> 00:16:34,633
(funky music)

314
00:16:37,999 --> 00:16:40,170
(suspenseful music)

315
00:16:40,170 --> 00:16:41,484
They're real.

316
00:16:41,484 --> 00:16:45,401
(suspenseful music continues)

317
00:16:46,770 --> 00:16:49,370
That's gonna be me someday, you know?

318
00:16:49,370 --> 00:16:50,760
It just takes time.

319
00:16:56,607 --> 00:16:58,320
- Ey, yo, Clyde!

320
00:16:58,320 --> 00:16:59,670
The Snakes, man.

321
00:16:59,670 --> 00:17:02,040
The Snakes, they got Slick in Beebo.

322
00:17:02,040 --> 00:17:03,750
Yo, man! Come on, man, come on!

323
00:17:03,750 --> 00:17:05,602
- Hey, you're not gonna wanna miss this.

324
00:17:05,602 --> 00:17:06,667
Let's get 'em!

325
00:17:06,667 --> 00:17:10,084
(gang members clamoring)

326
00:17:12,000 --> 00:17:14,250
You see that line?

327
00:17:14,250 --> 00:17:17,024
We're in Snake's territory now.

328
00:17:17,024 --> 00:17:20,536
(dramatic music)

329
00:17:20,536 --> 00:17:22,455
- [Boy] You're gonna get it now.

330
00:17:22,455 --> 00:17:26,213
(dramatic music continues)

331
00:17:26,213 --> 00:17:27,796
- Stay back, Billy!

332
00:17:30,072 --> 00:17:30,989
Let him go!

333
00:17:31,827 --> 00:17:34,988
(dramatic music continues)

334
00:17:34,988 --> 00:17:35,821
- [Group] Let's get them.

335
00:17:35,821 --> 00:17:36,654
Come on.

336
00:17:36,654 --> 00:17:39,404
(dramatic music)

337
00:17:42,022 --> 00:17:43,887
- Well, well, well look who's here.

338
00:17:43,887 --> 00:17:45,840
- Hey now, don't be afraid.

339
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,351
Stand your ground.

340
00:17:47,351 --> 00:17:48,870
(siren ringing)

341
00:17:48,870 --> 00:17:49,703
- Break it up.

342
00:17:49,703 --> 00:17:51,369
Break it up.
- I'm gonna get you, punk.

343
00:17:51,369 --> 00:17:52,760
- You know where to find me.

344
00:17:53,873 --> 00:17:54,706
- You've been warned before.

345
00:17:54,706 --> 00:17:57,193
This area is off limit.

346
00:17:57,193 --> 00:17:59,860
(siren wailing)

347
00:18:07,612 --> 00:18:08,573
- Hey, let's get him.

348
00:18:08,573 --> 00:18:09,740
There he goes!

349
00:18:13,303 --> 00:18:16,053
(dramatic music)

350
00:18:57,686 --> 00:19:00,350
(table clattering)

351
00:19:00,350 --> 00:19:03,933
(dramatic music continues)

352
00:19:07,255 --> 00:19:09,453
(Mr. Fallon screaming)

353
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:10,671
- Get outta my store!

354
00:19:10,671 --> 00:19:11,504
- Easy, easy.

355
00:19:11,504 --> 00:19:12,545
I'm leaving, okay?
- [Mr. Fallon] Leave!

356
00:19:12,545 --> 00:19:14,645
- I'm going.
- Go!

357
00:19:14,645 --> 00:19:15,478
Go on!

358
00:19:19,468 --> 00:19:24,468
They're getting younger
all the time. (sighs)

359
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,802
Oh look at this.

360
00:19:26,802 --> 00:19:28,500
Look at this.

361
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,480
Oh, look at this.

362
00:19:31,480 --> 00:19:33,282
(table clattering)

363
00:19:33,282 --> 00:19:34,115
Oh. Oh.

364
00:19:35,442 --> 00:19:37,305
All right. All right.

365
00:19:37,305 --> 00:19:38,138
Okay.

366
00:19:39,750 --> 00:19:40,914
Oh.

367
00:19:40,914 --> 00:19:43,106
(table clattering)

368
00:19:43,106 --> 00:19:45,093
Oh, look at this.

369
00:19:46,950 --> 00:19:48,393
Okay, let me sit.

370
00:19:50,127 --> 00:19:51,360
Okay.

371
00:19:51,360 --> 00:19:52,890
What a mess.

372
00:19:52,890 --> 00:19:54,360
What a mess.

373
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:55,800
What's this?

374
00:19:55,800 --> 00:19:57,420
Who are you?

375
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:58,380
Oh, yeah, I know,

376
00:19:58,380 --> 00:20:00,603
I recognize you by your wheels.

377
00:20:03,777 --> 00:20:04,610
Look at this.

378
00:20:04,610 --> 00:20:06,570
Two horses and no place to go.

379
00:20:06,570 --> 00:20:07,740
Okay.

380
00:20:07,740 --> 00:20:08,583
Here's a wagon.

381
00:20:09,720 --> 00:20:13,590
Oh, that's Margaret Mouse.

382
00:20:13,590 --> 00:20:15,900
You straight is way the heck up.

383
00:20:15,900 --> 00:20:17,250
Okay.

384
00:20:17,250 --> 00:20:18,450
Take it easy.

385
00:20:18,450 --> 00:20:19,293
Where's Rocco?

386
00:20:20,190 --> 00:20:22,713
Oh, Rocco, how are you feeling?

387
00:20:23,582 --> 00:20:25,650
'Cause if somebody
pulled my ear off, I'd...

388
00:20:25,650 --> 00:20:27,750
Why am I talking to you?
You can't even hear me.

389
00:20:27,750 --> 00:20:29,130
I said I'd feel the same way

390
00:20:29,130 --> 00:20:30,630
if somebody ripped my ear off.

391
00:20:31,524 --> 00:20:32,370
(Mr. Fallon sighs)

392
00:20:32,370 --> 00:20:34,140
Everybody calm down.

393
00:20:34,140 --> 00:20:36,750
Everybody calm down because
this has happened before.

394
00:20:36,750 --> 00:20:38,730
And I'm gonna fix your good as new,

395
00:20:38,730 --> 00:20:40,463
don't worry about it.

396
00:20:40,463 --> 00:20:41,853
I just gotta find the glue.

397
00:20:43,080 --> 00:20:45,150
Hello?
- Huh?

398
00:20:45,150 --> 00:20:45,983
- Hello?

399
00:20:45,983 --> 00:20:47,580
Is there something you want?

400
00:20:47,580 --> 00:20:49,030
Can I help you with anything?

401
00:20:51,092 --> 00:20:52,443
- No, no, no sir.

402
00:20:53,457 --> 00:20:55,023
- Oh, oh, you're browsing?

403
00:20:55,878 --> 00:20:57,093
- Y, y, yeah, yes, sir.

404
00:20:58,260 --> 00:20:59,093
- Well, I'm not sure,

405
00:20:59,093 --> 00:21:01,920
but I think if you stood up,

406
00:21:01,920 --> 00:21:02,940
you do better browsing

407
00:21:02,940 --> 00:21:04,563
'cause now you're browsing low.

408
00:21:07,470 --> 00:21:09,123
You see, everything you
see is from here down.

409
00:21:09,123 --> 00:21:11,280
You, you're missing
everything from here up.

410
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:12,830
I'm not sure, I could be wrong.

411
00:21:15,540 --> 00:21:16,443
She's pretty, huh?

412
00:21:18,258 --> 00:21:19,841
Dance ballerina.

413
00:21:19,841 --> 00:21:22,424
(gentle music)

414
00:21:33,939 --> 00:21:36,840
- I, i, is, is this
supposed to be a toy store?

415
00:21:36,840 --> 00:21:37,934
- It's not supposed to be a...

416
00:21:37,934 --> 00:21:39,421
It is a toy shop.

417
00:21:39,421 --> 00:21:41,130
- Well, well, well then
where's the Game Boy

418
00:21:41,130 --> 00:21:43,050
and the Mighty Morphin Power Rangers?

419
00:21:43,050 --> 00:21:44,100
- Who left you in charge

420
00:21:44,100 --> 00:21:46,410
of what's a good toy and what's a bad toy?

421
00:21:46,410 --> 00:21:47,280
- I know what's fun.

422
00:21:47,280 --> 00:21:49,620
- Oh, you know, what's fun?

423
00:21:49,620 --> 00:21:51,780
Like those hoodlums that chased
you in, yeah, that was fun.

424
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,150
No, we don't have toys that do that.

425
00:21:54,150 --> 00:21:56,103
That purple and green boy,

426
00:21:58,680 --> 00:22:00,390
what does he want with you?

427
00:22:00,390 --> 00:22:04,020
- Well, there's a fight in
the lot down the street.

428
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:05,070
- A fight?

429
00:22:05,070 --> 00:22:06,210
You lied to me?

430
00:22:06,210 --> 00:22:07,610
You mean you're one of them?

431
00:22:08,730 --> 00:22:09,990
You're a hoodlum.

432
00:22:09,990 --> 00:22:11,790
- Well, I'm, I'm, I'm not a hoodlum.

433
00:22:11,790 --> 00:22:14,820
Well, you see, it, it's my friend Clyde.

434
00:22:14,820 --> 00:22:15,960
Well, he's not really...

435
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,125
Well...

436
00:22:17,125 --> 00:22:17,958
- What? What?

437
00:22:17,958 --> 00:22:19,290
What?

438
00:22:19,290 --> 00:22:20,123
- It was the first day of school

439
00:22:20,123 --> 00:22:22,770
and I just wanted to join
the Science Club, honest.

440
00:22:22,770 --> 00:22:23,733
- The Science Club?

441
00:22:24,990 --> 00:22:27,210
Yeah, that happened to me one time.

442
00:22:27,210 --> 00:22:28,830
Excuse me.

443
00:22:28,830 --> 00:22:30,753
Being a member of a group.

444
00:22:31,830 --> 00:22:34,530
Ah, but you have to ask
yourself the question:

445
00:22:34,530 --> 00:22:35,850
Where's my integrity?

446
00:22:35,850 --> 00:22:37,380
Where's my moral strength?

447
00:22:37,380 --> 00:22:38,910
Where's my honesty?

448
00:22:38,910 --> 00:22:40,870
- I must have left 'em in Detroit.

449
00:22:40,870 --> 00:22:41,703
(Mr. Fallon laughing)

450
00:22:41,703 --> 00:22:42,633
- Detroit?

451
00:22:42,633 --> 00:22:43,894
So that means,

452
00:22:43,894 --> 00:22:47,060
so that means you're new
to the neighborhood, huh?

453
00:22:47,060 --> 00:22:48,570
(Mr. Fallon laughing)

454
00:22:48,570 --> 00:22:50,130
What's your name?

455
00:22:50,130 --> 00:22:51,690
- Billy.

456
00:22:51,690 --> 00:22:54,092
- That is absolutely correct.

457
00:22:54,092 --> 00:22:55,987
(metal rattling)

458
00:22:55,987 --> 00:22:57,720
(Mr. Fallon whistling)

459
00:22:57,720 --> 00:22:58,593
Ringa-linga-ling.

460
00:23:00,330 --> 00:23:01,163
- [Billy] What's that?

461
00:23:01,163 --> 00:23:04,890
- Oh, that is a puzzle.

462
00:23:04,890 --> 00:23:05,820
Isn't that wonderful?

463
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:06,653
Look at it.

464
00:23:06,653 --> 00:23:07,890
See the ring?

465
00:23:07,890 --> 00:23:10,873
You have to get the ring
off of these horseshoe.

466
00:23:10,873 --> 00:23:12,494
Ah.

467
00:23:12,494 --> 00:23:14,460
- But that, that's impossible.

468
00:23:14,460 --> 00:23:16,261
I mean, the ring's not big enough

469
00:23:16,261 --> 00:23:17,391
to go around the horseshoes,

470
00:23:17,391 --> 00:23:18,641
unless there's a break in it.

471
00:23:18,641 --> 00:23:19,813
- Yes, it is the way...

472
00:23:19,813 --> 00:23:21,660
So you think... What are
you trying to tell me?

473
00:23:21,660 --> 00:23:23,310
You think that the answers to the puzzle

474
00:23:23,310 --> 00:23:25,080
is that there's a crack in it?

475
00:23:25,080 --> 00:23:26,160
No.

476
00:23:26,160 --> 00:23:27,780
No, no, no, no.

477
00:23:27,780 --> 00:23:29,730
It's not because there's a crack in it,

478
00:23:29,730 --> 00:23:31,710
that would be a silly puzzle.

479
00:23:31,710 --> 00:23:33,300
If you say the, the,

480
00:23:33,300 --> 00:23:37,290
the solution is that there's a crack.

481
00:23:37,290 --> 00:23:38,123
Okay.

482
00:23:38,123 --> 00:23:39,603
- But if you could freeze
the horseshoe, then,

483
00:23:39,603 --> 00:23:41,550
they they contract.

484
00:23:41,550 --> 00:23:42,510
- No, no, no.

485
00:23:42,510 --> 00:23:45,963
This puzzle is done at room temperature.

486
00:23:47,007 --> 00:23:48,420
- Yeah, it's impossible.

487
00:23:48,420 --> 00:23:51,153
- Well, impossible things
are happening every day.

488
00:23:52,394 --> 00:23:54,038
Hey, hey, hey.

489
00:23:54,038 --> 00:23:56,788
(metal rattling)

490
00:23:58,959 --> 00:24:00,240
Ta-da!

491
00:24:00,240 --> 00:24:01,680
- How'd you do that?

492
00:24:01,680 --> 00:24:02,790
- Well, (chuckles)

493
00:24:02,790 --> 00:24:04,050
lucky, I guess.

494
00:24:04,050 --> 00:24:07,860
But problems are made to be solved.

495
00:24:07,860 --> 00:24:10,740
Like you, a scientific boy like you,

496
00:24:10,740 --> 00:24:11,617
you say things like,

497
00:24:11,617 --> 00:24:14,610
"Well, this is an old toy shop,"

498
00:24:14,610 --> 00:24:15,630
you're not interested.

499
00:24:15,630 --> 00:24:17,340
I love science.

500
00:24:17,340 --> 00:24:18,173
I love it.

501
00:24:18,173 --> 00:24:19,950
Science is a great subject,

502
00:24:19,950 --> 00:24:21,150
It's my favorite subject.

503
00:24:21,150 --> 00:24:22,170
I'll tell you the truth.

504
00:24:22,170 --> 00:24:24,090
I love everything about
science, everything,

505
00:24:24,090 --> 00:24:24,930
and interestingly...

506
00:24:24,930 --> 00:24:26,820
Oh, it's a hot subject.

507
00:24:26,820 --> 00:24:29,760
You know what I'm
talking about? (laughing)

508
00:24:29,760 --> 00:24:32,220
Okay, look, I'm gonna,

509
00:24:32,220 --> 00:24:34,052
I'm gonna tell you that
I got something for you

510
00:24:34,052 --> 00:24:35,040
right in here,

511
00:24:35,040 --> 00:24:36,480
something that's really beautiful.

512
00:24:36,480 --> 00:24:37,313
Ta-da!

513
00:24:38,370 --> 00:24:40,320
Gently, gently.

514
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:41,760
Okay.

515
00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:44,580
I have something for you.

516
00:24:44,580 --> 00:24:45,690
Hi.

517
00:24:45,690 --> 00:24:47,190
Okay.

518
00:24:47,190 --> 00:24:49,260
Okay. Easy does it.

519
00:24:49,260 --> 00:24:51,390
Easy does it?

520
00:24:51,390 --> 00:24:52,503
Yes. Okay.

521
00:24:53,550 --> 00:24:54,383
Attention.

522
00:24:55,470 --> 00:24:56,563
Yes, here we go.

523
00:24:57,451 --> 00:24:58,284
Okay.

524
00:24:59,280 --> 00:25:00,690
Okay.

525
00:25:00,690 --> 00:25:02,592
Gentle and beautiful.

526
00:25:02,592 --> 00:25:03,732
Look at that.

527
00:25:03,732 --> 00:25:05,790
Oh, that's lovely.

528
00:25:05,790 --> 00:25:07,282
Right here.

529
00:25:07,282 --> 00:25:08,115
Beautiful.

530
00:25:09,120 --> 00:25:10,230
Yes.

531
00:25:10,230 --> 00:25:13,260
Yes, Sarah, thank you for waiting.

532
00:25:13,260 --> 00:25:14,778
Oh, look at that.

533
00:25:14,778 --> 00:25:16,140
Look at that.

534
00:25:16,140 --> 00:25:17,466
Yes.

535
00:25:17,466 --> 00:25:19,140
(Mr. Fallon chuckles)

536
00:25:19,140 --> 00:25:21,630
And there's his cigar.

537
00:25:21,630 --> 00:25:22,563
How about that?

538
00:25:24,300 --> 00:25:25,173
- They're old.

539
00:25:26,100 --> 00:25:27,390
- They're antiques.

540
00:25:27,390 --> 00:25:28,710
And they are old,

541
00:25:28,710 --> 00:25:31,200
as are principles they represent:

542
00:25:31,200 --> 00:25:34,470
honesty, courage, integrity.

543
00:25:34,470 --> 00:25:37,650
This woman started colleges,

544
00:25:37,650 --> 00:25:39,150
universities for people.

545
00:25:39,150 --> 00:25:40,630
They all influenced lives.

546
00:25:40,630 --> 00:25:41,630
- Yeah. Yeah.

547
00:25:41,630 --> 00:25:43,320
I, I'm sure the planet that you come from,

548
00:25:43,320 --> 00:25:45,000
these things mean something;

549
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:45,900
but here on earth,

550
00:25:46,950 --> 00:25:48,210
I need something different.

551
00:25:48,210 --> 00:25:49,410
- No, I know what you need.

552
00:25:49,410 --> 00:25:51,360
You need a little respect.

553
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:53,130
Respect is what you need.

554
00:25:53,130 --> 00:25:53,963
Yes.

555
00:25:53,963 --> 00:25:55,710
- What I need is a bulletproof vest.

556
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:57,660
- A bulletproof vest?

557
00:25:57,660 --> 00:25:59,250
Is that what you want?

558
00:25:59,250 --> 00:26:00,660
A bulletproof vest?

559
00:26:00,660 --> 00:26:01,650
All right.

560
00:26:01,650 --> 00:26:06,330
I've got something just
as good right here.

561
00:26:06,330 --> 00:26:07,803
Have him back very soon.

562
00:26:08,790 --> 00:26:10,800
All right, here you are.

563
00:26:10,800 --> 00:26:12,993
This is for you.

564
00:26:14,190 --> 00:26:15,630
- A doll?

565
00:26:15,630 --> 00:26:18,903
- A royal knight in shining armor.

566
00:26:20,610 --> 00:26:22,950
And the coast is clear,

567
00:26:22,950 --> 00:26:24,123
so you better go home.

568
00:26:27,030 --> 00:26:29,670
Maybe both of you will learn something.

569
00:26:29,670 --> 00:26:30,930
- Both?

570
00:26:30,930 --> 00:26:34,023
- Well, there's you and there's him.

571
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:37,650
- You're nuts, huh?

572
00:26:37,650 --> 00:26:40,800
- Well, the jury's still out. (chuckles)

573
00:26:40,800 --> 00:26:41,913
Take care, Billy.

574
00:26:42,960 --> 00:26:43,793
(bell jingles)

575
00:26:43,793 --> 00:26:45,029
Take care.

576
00:26:45,029 --> 00:26:46,515
(bell jingles)

577
00:26:46,515 --> 00:26:49,098
(gentle music)

578
00:26:57,822 --> 00:26:59,155
- Mom, I'm home!

579
00:27:00,429 --> 00:27:01,262
Mom?

580
00:27:07,140 --> 00:27:07,973
Mom?

581
00:27:07,973 --> 00:27:11,414
(gentle music continues)

582
00:27:13,278 --> 00:27:15,695
(door bangs)

583
00:27:25,050 --> 00:27:27,300
You know that girl at school today,

584
00:27:27,300 --> 00:27:29,730
she's kinda cute, huh?

585
00:27:29,730 --> 00:27:30,783
She doesn't like me.

586
00:27:32,430 --> 00:27:33,380
She's nice, though.

587
00:27:35,375 --> 00:27:36,510
Of course she's probably
nice to everybody.

588
00:27:36,510 --> 00:27:38,733
You know, she's one of those nice people.

589
00:27:42,210 --> 00:27:44,110
Nice people don't like people like me.

590
00:27:56,683 --> 00:28:00,908
I just wish this past
year just never happened.

591
00:28:00,908 --> 00:28:01,741
I mean,

592
00:28:03,930 --> 00:28:06,870
I just wish you could just stop time

593
00:28:06,870 --> 00:28:08,940
and live the good parts

594
00:28:08,940 --> 00:28:12,243
and fast forward through the bad parts.

595
00:28:15,270 --> 00:28:16,960
You, you,

596
00:28:16,960 --> 00:28:17,913
you don't know time.

597
00:28:17,913 --> 00:28:20,403
You just, you just sit
on the shelf all day.

598
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:24,900
You're lucky you don't have
to worry about anything

599
00:28:24,900 --> 00:28:27,573
but looking good and being dusted.

600
00:28:31,800 --> 00:28:32,820
That's the life.

601
00:28:36,284 --> 00:28:39,201
(insects chirping)

602
00:28:40,484 --> 00:28:42,984
(dog barking)

603
00:28:53,663 --> 00:28:54,496
- Billy?

604
00:28:56,190 --> 00:28:57,366
Honey, what are you still doing up?

605
00:28:57,366 --> 00:28:58,830
Do you know what time it is?

606
00:28:58,830 --> 00:28:59,850
- Astronomy project.

607
00:28:59,850 --> 00:29:01,290
- Aye-yi-yi.

608
00:29:01,290 --> 00:29:02,640
Look at this.

609
00:29:02,640 --> 00:29:03,930
This is a mess.

610
00:29:03,930 --> 00:29:05,880
You have a homework on
your first day of school?

611
00:29:05,880 --> 00:29:07,650
No, it's not due till November.

612
00:29:07,650 --> 00:29:09,930
I just thought I'd get a headstart.

613
00:29:09,930 --> 00:29:10,880
- My kitchen knife.

614
00:29:13,740 --> 00:29:14,573
Right.

615
00:29:15,690 --> 00:29:16,523
Good boy.

616
00:29:18,540 --> 00:29:20,970
- I met some kids at school today.

617
00:29:20,970 --> 00:29:22,170
- God, I'm so exhausted.

618
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,870
That was my third double
shift in four days,

619
00:29:24,870 --> 00:29:27,717
my feet are killing me. (sighs)

620
00:29:27,717 --> 00:29:28,717
I gotta take a bath.

621
00:29:31,050 --> 00:29:33,138
- Yeah, they really liked me.

622
00:29:33,138 --> 00:29:34,305
- What, honey?

623
00:29:35,573 --> 00:29:36,406
- Nothing.

624
00:29:40,206 --> 00:29:41,039
- Okay.

625
00:29:43,546 --> 00:29:44,963
- Goodnight.

626
00:29:44,963 --> 00:29:46,213
I love you too.

627
00:29:47,461 --> 00:29:50,264
(objects clattering)

628
00:29:50,264 --> 00:29:51,097
- Billy?

629
00:29:52,470 --> 00:29:53,303
Billy.

630
00:29:58,101 --> 00:30:00,684
(somber music)

631
00:30:26,554 --> 00:30:29,471
(mysterious music)

632
00:30:38,807 --> 00:30:40,662
- [Yarik] Ow. (groans)

633
00:30:40,662 --> 00:30:42,098
Blasted leg.

634
00:30:42,098 --> 00:30:44,266
Oh. (groaning)

635
00:30:44,266 --> 00:30:47,737
(suspenseful music)

636
00:30:47,737 --> 00:30:48,672
Look at this.

637
00:30:48,672 --> 00:30:52,944
It's a bloody catastrophe. (muttering)

638
00:30:52,944 --> 00:30:55,105
(suspenseful music)

639
00:30:55,105 --> 00:30:58,188
When I catch up to the rotten rascal.

640
00:30:59,443 --> 00:31:01,390
(knight groaning)

641
00:31:01,390 --> 00:31:03,004
Where are you, traitor?

642
00:31:03,004 --> 00:31:03,837
You can't escape,

643
00:31:03,837 --> 00:31:08,837
I'll pursue you to the
ends of the earth. (groans)

644
00:31:08,902 --> 00:31:12,050
(suspenseful music)

645
00:31:12,050 --> 00:31:13,440
Hi Jove,

646
00:31:13,440 --> 00:31:14,580
you're but a pup,

647
00:31:14,580 --> 00:31:16,710
hardly a squire of of
worth by anyone's measure.

648
00:31:16,710 --> 00:31:17,670
- What do you want?

649
00:31:17,670 --> 00:31:19,290
- What were you thinking, lad?

650
00:31:19,290 --> 00:31:20,670
Look at me leg?

651
00:31:20,670 --> 00:31:23,320
This is not gonna make an
impossible task any easier.

652
00:31:24,270 --> 00:31:26,640
Are you sure it is you who,

653
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,926
who's needing me service?

654
00:31:27,926 --> 00:31:29,238
Oh, oh, oh.

655
00:31:29,238 --> 00:31:30,342
Oh!

656
00:31:30,342 --> 00:31:32,014
(armor clattering)

657
00:31:32,014 --> 00:31:33,300
(suspenseful music)

658
00:31:33,300 --> 00:31:34,428
- Mom!

659
00:31:34,428 --> 00:31:35,280
- Shh, shh, shh.

660
00:31:35,280 --> 00:31:36,113
- What do you want?

661
00:31:36,113 --> 00:31:37,143
- I, I believe, pup,

662
00:31:38,640 --> 00:31:40,380
that is for you to tell me.

663
00:31:40,380 --> 00:31:42,083
- Who are you?

664
00:31:42,083 --> 00:31:43,027
- I'm known as Yarik,

665
00:31:43,027 --> 00:31:45,390
knight of the Order of Fallon.

666
00:31:45,390 --> 00:31:49,488
And so it seems, by your
command, young squire,

667
00:31:49,488 --> 00:31:51,390
I'm again with an injury.

668
00:31:51,390 --> 00:31:54,870
It gives me the chills. (groaning)

669
00:31:54,870 --> 00:31:55,980
- Mom!

670
00:31:55,980 --> 00:31:57,330
- Why me, dear Lord?

671
00:31:57,330 --> 00:31:58,938
What can I make of this?

672
00:31:58,938 --> 00:31:59,948
- What's a better?

673
00:31:59,948 --> 00:32:00,900
What is it?

674
00:32:00,900 --> 00:32:02,340
- Right there, look!

675
00:32:02,340 --> 00:32:03,300
- She can't see me, lad.

676
00:32:03,300 --> 00:32:05,130
You're the only one who can see me.

677
00:32:05,130 --> 00:32:07,599
- Sweetie, you're dreaming.
- [Yarik] Oh, me leg.

678
00:32:07,599 --> 00:32:08,432
- Wake up.

679
00:32:08,432 --> 00:32:09,265
- I'm not dreaming!

680
00:32:09,265 --> 00:32:10,500
Right there, he's standing right there!

681
00:32:10,500 --> 00:32:11,940
- A bit tender.

682
00:32:11,940 --> 00:32:12,773
- Wake up, sweetie,

683
00:32:12,773 --> 00:32:14,040
you're still asleep.

684
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:14,873
- Go away!

685
00:32:14,873 --> 00:32:16,590
- Haven't you caused enough
trouble for one night?

686
00:32:16,590 --> 00:32:17,640
- Billy, you're still sleeping.

687
00:32:17,640 --> 00:32:19,627
- Does it look like I'm sleeping to you?

688
00:32:19,627 --> 00:32:21,573
There's a man in armor
standing at the foot of my bed!

689
00:32:21,573 --> 00:32:23,730
- Stop bouncing around.

690
00:32:23,730 --> 00:32:25,320
I told you she can't see me.

691
00:32:25,320 --> 00:32:27,330
- [Mom] Billy, sit down.

692
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:29,520
- You're the only one.

693
00:32:29,520 --> 00:32:30,353
- [Mom] Sit down!

694
00:32:30,353 --> 00:32:32,180
- Ah, let's, let's see what I got here

695
00:32:32,180 --> 00:32:33,453
on the old appendage.

696
00:32:34,421 --> 00:32:37,413
- Honey, you're dreaming.

697
00:32:38,796 --> 00:32:43,796
(armor squeaking)
(Yarik humming)

698
00:32:43,951 --> 00:32:45,240
You're all right now.

699
00:32:45,240 --> 00:32:46,073
- [Yarik] Very good.

700
00:32:46,073 --> 00:32:48,177
Here, there we go.
- Yeah, I'm fine.

701
00:32:49,993 --> 00:32:51,334
- Me leg's perfect.

702
00:32:51,334 --> 00:32:52,643
(armor clattering)

703
00:32:52,643 --> 00:32:55,140
- You see the reflection over there,

704
00:32:55,140 --> 00:32:56,730
from the fish tank?

705
00:32:56,730 --> 00:32:57,903
That's all it was.

706
00:32:59,490 --> 00:33:00,780
I'm gonna tuck you in.

707
00:33:00,780 --> 00:33:01,613
Come on.

708
00:33:03,060 --> 00:33:05,440
I know things have been tough on you

709
00:33:06,419 --> 00:33:09,447
'cause of your father and the move and on.

710
00:33:09,447 --> 00:33:10,560
You had a nightmare.

711
00:33:10,560 --> 00:33:12,330
I'm sorry.

712
00:33:12,330 --> 00:33:15,232
Honey, sleep tight and I'll
see you in the morning.

713
00:33:15,232 --> 00:33:16,065
- Okay.

714
00:33:17,045 --> 00:33:17,878
But...

715
00:33:19,902 --> 00:33:21,383
- You're all right now, aren't you?

716
00:33:22,950 --> 00:33:24,903
- Yeah, I'm fine.

717
00:33:24,903 --> 00:33:25,986
- Okay. Good.

718
00:33:27,322 --> 00:33:28,655
Good night, son.

719
00:33:29,636 --> 00:33:30,469
- Night.

720
00:33:32,880 --> 00:33:34,391
(Billy sighs)

721
00:33:34,391 --> 00:33:37,474
(suspenseful music)

722
00:33:38,790 --> 00:33:40,530
- That's enough of that, lad.

723
00:33:40,530 --> 00:33:43,180
No sense making all three
of us upset, now, is there?

724
00:33:45,230 --> 00:33:50,230
(Yarik groaning)
(armor squeaking)

725
00:33:51,150 --> 00:33:54,864
The leg won't seem to hold its place.

726
00:33:54,864 --> 00:33:57,720
Do you have something I
could tie it off with?

727
00:33:57,720 --> 00:33:58,770
A brace of some kind.

728
00:33:58,770 --> 00:33:59,603
Oh.

729
00:34:03,120 --> 00:34:04,410
- What do you want?

730
00:34:04,410 --> 00:34:06,120
- I told you before, lad,

731
00:34:06,120 --> 00:34:08,250
that is entirely your decision.

732
00:34:08,250 --> 00:34:12,093
I was summoned; at extreme
urgency, I might add;

733
00:34:12,960 --> 00:34:13,793
by you.

734
00:34:14,640 --> 00:34:15,480
- I did not.

735
00:34:15,480 --> 00:34:17,310
- I was more than surprised meself

736
00:34:17,310 --> 00:34:18,930
to be called at such an ungodly hour.

737
00:34:18,930 --> 00:34:22,440
But such as it is my duty
to serve, alas, here I am.

738
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,570
Don't try me patience now.

739
00:34:24,570 --> 00:34:27,718
Let's see how this is going to work out.

740
00:34:27,718 --> 00:34:29,700
(armor squeaking)

741
00:34:29,700 --> 00:34:32,220
Oh, this won't work at all.

742
00:34:32,220 --> 00:34:33,690
- This is ridiculous.

743
00:34:33,690 --> 00:34:35,490
I'm going outta my mind.

744
00:34:35,490 --> 00:34:38,310
- Oh, I wouldn't laugh if I were you.

745
00:34:38,310 --> 00:34:39,780
It's all your fault after all.

746
00:34:39,780 --> 00:34:40,680
- My fault?

747
00:34:40,680 --> 00:34:42,692
- Well, who do you think
threw me against the wall?

748
00:34:42,692 --> 00:34:47,692
- What?

749
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:58,202
(objects clattering)

750
00:35:13,710 --> 00:35:15,200
Where is that tin knight?

751
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:18,930
- At this moment, he's
limping down the stairwell.

752
00:35:18,930 --> 00:35:21,930
- You expect me to believe
that you're the tin knight?

753
00:35:21,930 --> 00:35:24,240
- Actually, Bill, your belief
is a little consequence.

754
00:35:24,240 --> 00:35:25,830
I'm here until the task is completed,

755
00:35:25,830 --> 00:35:26,880
whether you like it or not.

756
00:35:26,880 --> 00:35:28,860
- What are you talking about?

757
00:35:28,860 --> 00:35:30,450
- I'm here to help you.

758
00:35:30,450 --> 00:35:31,283
- Help me?

759
00:35:33,660 --> 00:35:34,500
- Well, (chuckles)

760
00:35:34,500 --> 00:35:37,023
perhaps it's time to go
over a few of the basics.

761
00:35:39,060 --> 00:35:40,260
As a knight,

762
00:35:40,260 --> 00:35:42,480
as a knight of the Order of Fallon,

763
00:35:42,480 --> 00:35:44,220
I'm bound by honored to appear in service

764
00:35:44,220 --> 00:35:45,360
wherever the need is greatest

765
00:35:45,360 --> 00:35:47,558
and the subject is worthiest.

766
00:35:47,558 --> 00:35:48,480
- Worthiest?

767
00:35:48,480 --> 00:35:49,350
Me?

768
00:35:49,350 --> 00:35:50,970
- Your concerns mirror me own, lad,

769
00:35:50,970 --> 00:35:52,110
but that is the oath I swore

770
00:35:52,110 --> 00:35:53,520
and the life I choose.

771
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:56,220
So I'm imagining that if you're
not the worthies of squires,

772
00:35:56,220 --> 00:35:58,530
your need must be especially great.

773
00:35:58,530 --> 00:36:00,210
- I don't need anything from you.

774
00:36:00,210 --> 00:36:01,881
- Oh, you don't?

775
00:36:01,881 --> 00:36:03,810
- Where do you come from anyway?

776
00:36:03,810 --> 00:36:06,360
- Well, without getting too technical,

777
00:36:06,360 --> 00:36:08,760
which I couldn't anyway, I'm simply,

778
00:36:08,760 --> 00:36:11,850
I'm from, I'm from there.

779
00:36:11,850 --> 00:36:13,980
You know? I'm from there.

780
00:36:13,980 --> 00:36:14,813
- Where?

781
00:36:15,843 --> 00:36:16,676
- Well there, you know?

782
00:36:16,676 --> 00:36:19,380
I mean, you can call it the other side,

783
00:36:19,380 --> 00:36:22,050
the magical plane, the other realm.

784
00:36:22,050 --> 00:36:23,790
But it all boils down to the same thing.

785
00:36:23,790 --> 00:36:24,990
I am stuck here.

786
00:36:24,990 --> 00:36:27,840
I can't get back there until
I assist you with your task.

787
00:36:27,840 --> 00:36:29,580
- [Billy] You're wasting your time.

788
00:36:29,580 --> 00:36:32,880
I don't need help from
you or from anybody.

789
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:34,560
- Well, I wouldn't mind getting back

790
00:36:34,560 --> 00:36:37,320
just as quickly as I can.

791
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:39,120
I have a lady waiting.

792
00:36:39,120 --> 00:36:40,343
- So just go.

793
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:43,170
- I can't go until your
hour of need is past.

794
00:36:43,170 --> 00:36:45,090
So if you'll just think
of something quick,

795
00:36:45,090 --> 00:36:46,050
I'll be gone from here

796
00:36:46,050 --> 00:36:49,173
and back in the arms of
my beautiful ballerina.

797
00:36:50,820 --> 00:36:52,410
- Ballerina?

798
00:36:52,410 --> 00:36:53,280
- The fair Katrina.

799
00:36:53,280 --> 00:36:54,690
She's quite majestic, you know?

800
00:36:54,690 --> 00:36:57,573
And so light.

801
00:36:58,437 --> 00:37:02,460
Her hands, graceful beyond words, really,.

802
00:37:02,460 --> 00:37:03,293
You know, she's

803
00:37:04,957 --> 00:37:05,957
a ballerina.

804
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,090
We were in the middle of a glorious dance

805
00:37:09,090 --> 00:37:10,143
when you called.

806
00:37:11,700 --> 00:37:14,250
- Well, it's all too overwhelming for me.

807
00:37:14,250 --> 00:37:15,900
I've got to sleep on it.

808
00:37:15,900 --> 00:37:18,000
- How can you sleep at a time like this?

809
00:37:18,000 --> 00:37:20,790
- I'm sure this is all just one big dream.

810
00:37:20,790 --> 00:37:23,133
- Let's, let's talk
about this now, shall we?

811
00:37:24,030 --> 00:37:25,770
- You're here to do what I say, right?

812
00:37:25,770 --> 00:37:27,570
- Well, more or less.

813
00:37:27,570 --> 00:37:28,980
- Good!

814
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:32,310
Then let me go to sleep.

815
00:37:32,310 --> 00:37:33,660
- But what of the task,

816
00:37:33,660 --> 00:37:36,633
the adventure I was
summoned to assist you with?

817
00:37:38,070 --> 00:37:38,903
- Adventure?

818
00:37:40,061 --> 00:37:44,340
If I can get through school
tomorrow without being killed,

819
00:37:44,340 --> 00:37:45,790
it's adventure enough for me.

820
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:48,720
I mean, you have to admit,

821
00:37:48,720 --> 00:37:51,960
this is just a pretty
hard story to swallow

822
00:37:51,960 --> 00:37:52,800
during the morning.

823
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:56,073
So just let me get some sleep.

824
00:37:59,407 --> 00:38:02,157
(birds chirping)

825
00:38:05,730 --> 00:38:07,950
- Up and at 'em, boyo!

826
00:38:07,950 --> 00:38:09,480
Time's are wasting.

827
00:38:09,480 --> 00:38:10,313
- Oh no.

828
00:38:11,936 --> 00:38:14,511
- [Mom] Did you get all that
stuff cleaned up off the floor?

829
00:38:14,511 --> 00:38:16,890
(paper rustles and thuds)

830
00:38:16,890 --> 00:38:17,723
- Yeah.

831
00:38:19,200 --> 00:38:20,917
- That's the way you clean up?

832
00:38:20,917 --> 00:38:23,400
- And look, there's a
paint stain right there?

833
00:38:23,400 --> 00:38:25,050
- This is the way you clean up?

834
00:38:25,050 --> 00:38:25,999
- Oh, this is glorious,

835
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,810
simply marvelous.
- Look at this paint stain.

836
00:38:27,810 --> 00:38:29,673
It's not gonna come off my table.

837
00:38:31,980 --> 00:38:33,120
- Mom, feel my head.

838
00:38:33,120 --> 00:38:34,313
Do I have a fever?

839
00:38:34,313 --> 00:38:36,000
(mom sighs)

840
00:38:36,000 --> 00:38:36,990
- Cool as a cucumber.

841
00:38:36,990 --> 00:38:38,070
- Cool as cucumber.

842
00:38:38,070 --> 00:38:39,630
- What, you don't wanna go
to school all of a sudden?

843
00:38:39,630 --> 00:38:41,100
Was this homework due for school?

844
00:38:41,100 --> 00:38:42,240
Is that what this is?

845
00:38:42,240 --> 00:38:44,370
- No, I told it's not due till November.

846
00:38:44,370 --> 00:38:45,203
All right. Good.

847
00:38:45,203 --> 00:38:47,070
Well, you're going to school.

848
00:38:47,070 --> 00:38:49,620
- Oh, he's a good looking chap.

849
00:38:49,620 --> 00:38:51,420
You have his eyes.

850
00:38:51,420 --> 00:38:52,980
- It's my dad.

851
00:38:52,980 --> 00:38:53,930
- What did you say?

852
00:38:55,470 --> 00:38:56,700
- You think dad was anything like me

853
00:38:56,700 --> 00:38:57,813
when he was my age?

854
00:39:01,039 --> 00:39:03,706
(pensive music)

855
00:39:07,560 --> 00:39:08,393
- No.

856
00:39:09,300 --> 00:39:10,740
No, you're nothing like your father.

857
00:39:10,740 --> 00:39:13,590
You're gonna make
something outta your life.

858
00:39:13,590 --> 00:39:14,850
No, get dressed, eat up,

859
00:39:14,850 --> 00:39:16,443
and brush your teeth.

860
00:39:19,759 --> 00:39:20,884
(pensive music)

861
00:39:20,884 --> 00:39:21,717
- Yeah. Yeah.

862
00:39:21,717 --> 00:39:22,550
I'm going.

863
00:39:24,281 --> 00:39:25,531
Brush my teeth.

864
00:39:31,456 --> 00:39:34,956
(pensive music continues)

865
00:39:38,724 --> 00:39:41,622
- [Teacher] Back then when
Columbus sailed this little ship.

866
00:39:41,622 --> 00:39:42,948
I mean, now, of course,

867
00:39:42,948 --> 00:39:45,627
there's travel by plane, train, cars.

868
00:39:45,627 --> 00:39:47,940
But back then, this was it, this was-

869
00:39:47,940 --> 00:39:49,440
- I'm certain that my leg will heal up

870
00:39:49,440 --> 00:39:52,260
as we approach the true task.

871
00:39:52,260 --> 00:39:55,320
What do you really think it is, really?

872
00:39:55,320 --> 00:39:56,153
- Shut up!

873
00:39:57,030 --> 00:39:58,293
Just stop talking!

874
00:39:59,370 --> 00:40:01,093
- I wasn't talking to you.

875
00:40:01,093 --> 00:40:02,468
- [Teacher] It'd be an
interesting thing for us to-

876
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,104
- I'll shut up if that's what you.

877
00:40:04,104 --> 00:40:05,138
I'll button my lip.

878
00:40:05,138 --> 00:40:08,388
Mum's the word if that's what you want.

879
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:10,590
- Pretty fascinating.

880
00:40:12,720 --> 00:40:17,220
Can you imagine what it
was like to sail a ship

881
00:40:17,220 --> 00:40:20,310
the size of this classroom
across the ocean?

882
00:40:20,310 --> 00:40:22,980
Now, who knows where
Columbus was really headed

883
00:40:22,980 --> 00:40:25,110
when he discovered the New World?

884
00:40:25,110 --> 00:40:25,950
- Angie.

885
00:40:25,950 --> 00:40:27,240
- India.
- Right.

886
00:40:27,240 --> 00:40:28,860
And that's why till this very day

887
00:40:28,860 --> 00:40:31,442
we call the Native people Indians.

888
00:40:31,442 --> 00:40:33,150
- Of course they don't
like being called Indians,

889
00:40:33,150 --> 00:40:34,830
they'd rather be called Native Americans

890
00:40:34,830 --> 00:40:35,910
or original people.

891
00:40:35,910 --> 00:40:37,530
- [Teacher] We all know that historians

892
00:40:37,530 --> 00:40:39,780
credit Christopher Columbus
with discovering America.

893
00:40:39,780 --> 00:40:41,010
- It seems to me there was already people

894
00:40:41,010 --> 00:40:42,300
living here at the time,

895
00:40:42,300 --> 00:40:44,160
and they discovered Columbus.

896
00:40:44,160 --> 00:40:46,910
- But it's actually been
revealed that he landed where?

897
00:40:48,240 --> 00:40:49,073
Class?

898
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:53,973
Clyde, where did Columbus really land?

899
00:40:55,590 --> 00:40:56,730
If I know that sauce hound,

900
00:40:56,730 --> 00:40:58,590
it was probably somewhere
near plenty of cheap women

901
00:40:58,590 --> 00:40:59,760
and cheap scotch.

902
00:40:59,760 --> 00:41:01,110
- Knock it off!

903
00:41:01,110 --> 00:41:03,870
- [Teacher] Billy, you have
the answer for us, right?

904
00:41:03,870 --> 00:41:04,703
Stand up.

905
00:41:11,512 --> 00:41:14,820
- You might wanna tell
San Salvador, The Bahamas.

906
00:41:14,820 --> 00:41:17,040
Of course Columbus was sleeping off

907
00:41:17,040 --> 00:41:18,750
a wicked case of the cabin spins

908
00:41:18,750 --> 00:41:20,010
when they reach land,

909
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:21,783
and never actually saw a thing.

910
00:41:26,340 --> 00:41:27,750
- Billy?

911
00:41:27,750 --> 00:41:29,160
- Um...

912
00:41:29,160 --> 00:41:30,600
- It's San Salvador, lad.

913
00:41:30,600 --> 00:41:32,040
- San Salvador.

914
00:41:32,040 --> 00:41:33,060
- [Teacher] Great, that's it?

915
00:41:33,060 --> 00:41:34,710
- Yeah!

916
00:41:34,710 --> 00:41:36,090
My boy's right.

917
00:41:36,090 --> 00:41:38,550
Yeah, he got that just fast.

918
00:41:38,550 --> 00:41:39,383
Yeah!
- Yes, he did.

919
00:41:39,383 --> 00:41:40,216
That's great.

920
00:41:40,216 --> 00:41:41,550
Clyde, why don't you just sit down, okay?

921
00:41:41,550 --> 00:41:42,383
- Oh yeah.

922
00:41:42,383 --> 00:41:43,418
Just you know?

923
00:41:44,370 --> 00:41:45,900
- Okay.

924
00:41:45,900 --> 00:41:50,400
Well, now Columbus' ambition
was to sail to the far east.

925
00:41:50,400 --> 00:41:51,360
See, in the 15th century,

926
00:41:51,360 --> 00:41:53,700
everybody thought the world was flat,

927
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,560
but you see today-
- Thank you.

928
00:41:54,560 --> 00:41:55,680
- [Teacher] We know different.

929
00:41:55,680 --> 00:41:56,827
Today everybody knows

930
00:41:56,827 --> 00:41:57,998
the world's a globe.
- You're welcome.

931
00:41:57,998 --> 00:42:01,181
(gentle music)

932
00:42:01,181 --> 00:42:04,931
(school children chattering)

933
00:42:13,590 --> 00:42:15,420
Surely I wasn't sent all this way

934
00:42:15,420 --> 00:42:16,920
merely to be a history tutor,

935
00:42:16,920 --> 00:42:17,970
but I've racked me brains

936
00:42:17,970 --> 00:42:19,650
and still come up with nothing.

937
00:42:19,650 --> 00:42:22,200
No wizards to battle, no dragons to fight,

938
00:42:22,200 --> 00:42:24,621
what in the name of
heaven you need help with?

939
00:42:24,621 --> 00:42:28,371
(school children chattering)

940
00:42:30,330 --> 00:42:31,293
What is it, lad?

941
00:42:32,484 --> 00:42:35,610
(school children chattering)

942
00:42:35,610 --> 00:42:36,465
- Toni.

943
00:42:36,465 --> 00:42:39,882
(gentle music continues)

944
00:42:54,792 --> 00:42:56,528
- Hey Toni, what happened?

945
00:42:56,528 --> 00:42:58,992
(boy speaking faintly)

946
00:42:58,992 --> 00:43:00,420
- Yes, of course,

947
00:43:00,420 --> 00:43:01,563
it's always a woman.

948
00:43:02,580 --> 00:43:03,570
Katrina, me darling,

949
00:43:03,570 --> 00:43:04,530
we're almost home.

950
00:43:04,530 --> 00:43:06,660
My leg feels better already.

951
00:43:06,660 --> 00:43:07,770
Go to her, lad.

952
00:43:07,770 --> 00:43:10,110
Let's join her for a repast.

953
00:43:10,110 --> 00:43:11,583
- She thinks I'm slime.

954
00:43:12,690 --> 00:43:14,133
- Well, these things change.

955
00:43:16,320 --> 00:43:18,600
- She even hates my friends.

956
00:43:18,600 --> 00:43:20,280
- Good friends are hard to find.

957
00:43:20,280 --> 00:43:23,670
If you have one friend, hold
him with bands of steel.

958
00:43:23,670 --> 00:43:24,843
Shakespeare said that.

959
00:43:26,715 --> 00:43:30,480
(school children chattering)

960
00:43:30,480 --> 00:43:32,040
Look at this, fella.

961
00:43:32,040 --> 00:43:34,770
He has this job, another on the weekend.

962
00:43:34,770 --> 00:43:35,610
His parents left home,

963
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:38,400
he's the sole support of his
younger brother and sister.

964
00:43:38,400 --> 00:43:39,270
He has great character,

965
00:43:39,270 --> 00:43:40,683
he'd make a fine friend.

966
00:43:42,570 --> 00:43:45,240
Now, here's a giant
fellow athlete an scholar.

967
00:43:45,240 --> 00:43:47,310
Someday he'll play a little
professional basketball,

968
00:43:47,310 --> 00:43:49,860
but he'll invest wisely.

969
00:43:49,860 --> 00:43:51,510
Quite serious about his business class,

970
00:43:51,510 --> 00:43:52,343
don't you know?

971
00:43:53,590 --> 00:43:55,443
Now, these two fellas

972
00:43:55,443 --> 00:43:57,750
have a wonderful and
cheerful outlook on life,

973
00:43:57,750 --> 00:44:00,150
which may very well be
the finest aspect of all.

974
00:44:01,260 --> 00:44:03,243
So what do you think?

975
00:44:06,129 --> 00:44:07,950
- I don't know.

976
00:44:07,950 --> 00:44:10,380
- The important thing is
to choose your friends

977
00:44:10,380 --> 00:44:12,827
and don't let them choose you.

978
00:44:12,827 --> 00:44:16,577
(school children chattering)

979
00:44:25,110 --> 00:44:27,905
Why don't you just go
and talk to her, lad?

980
00:44:27,905 --> 00:44:28,738
- No way!

981
00:44:28,738 --> 00:44:31,350
I, I can't even breathe around her.

982
00:44:31,350 --> 00:44:32,600
I can't even talk to her.

983
00:44:34,075 --> 00:44:35,637
- Oh.

984
00:44:35,637 --> 00:44:38,010
- Did you ever get that feeling
just by looking at a girl,

985
00:44:38,010 --> 00:44:40,560
it makes you wanna puke your guts up?

986
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,393
- Well-
- I mean, not,

987
00:44:41,393 --> 00:44:43,590
not like, like sick kind of puking,

988
00:44:43,590 --> 00:44:46,470
but kind of like if you
never saw her again that you,

989
00:44:46,470 --> 00:44:47,303
you'd die;

990
00:44:47,303 --> 00:44:48,360
but just by looking at her,

991
00:44:48,360 --> 00:44:51,150
it makes you sick to
your stomach, kind of.

992
00:44:51,150 --> 00:44:52,860
- And your hands get all sweaty?

993
00:44:52,860 --> 00:44:53,693
- [Billy] Yeah.

994
00:44:53,693 --> 00:44:55,110
- And your heart beats faster?

995
00:44:55,110 --> 00:44:56,430
- Pounds.

996
00:44:56,430 --> 00:44:57,263
- That's love.

997
00:44:58,110 --> 00:45:00,911
I'm on my way, Katrina, me darling.

998
00:45:00,911 --> 00:45:02,190
No. (chuckles)

999
00:45:02,190 --> 00:45:03,390
Laddie, do you trust me?

1000
00:45:04,800 --> 00:45:05,633
- I don't know.

1001
00:45:07,470 --> 00:45:08,739
- Well, I have a plan.

1002
00:45:08,739 --> 00:45:12,489
(school children chattering)

1003
00:45:22,710 --> 00:45:25,878
Billy, can I have a word with you?

1004
00:45:25,878 --> 00:45:29,628
(school children chattering)

1005
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,413
This wasn't part of the plan.

1006
00:45:33,413 --> 00:45:34,710
- Look, there's no way I can concentrate

1007
00:45:34,710 --> 00:45:36,900
with you buzzing around me all the time.

1008
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,460
- But she can't see me, lad

1009
00:45:38,460 --> 00:45:39,540
- But I can.

1010
00:45:39,540 --> 00:45:41,313
- How will my leg ever recover?

1011
00:45:43,484 --> 00:45:45,246
- Okay, here she comes.

1012
00:45:45,246 --> 00:45:47,927
- Just repeat me words, you'll do fine.

1013
00:45:47,927 --> 00:45:50,230
I hope you appreciate
what I'm going through.

1014
00:45:51,135 --> 00:45:53,718
(locker slams)

1015
00:45:55,706 --> 00:45:59,310
- [Billy] Uh... (clears throat)

1016
00:45:59,310 --> 00:46:00,143
- Yes?

1017
00:46:01,956 --> 00:46:03,397
- Uh...

1018
00:46:03,397 --> 00:46:04,536
(locker bangs)

1019
00:46:04,536 --> 00:46:07,249
- [Yarik] I'm very pleased
to see you again, me lady.

1020
00:46:07,249 --> 00:46:11,303
- I'm I'm very pleased to see you again,

1021
00:46:15,630 --> 00:46:16,463
Toni.

1022
00:46:20,460 --> 00:46:21,950
- Where's your buddy Clyde?

1023
00:46:21,950 --> 00:46:23,640
- [Yarik] It is hard for
me to see anything else

1024
00:46:23,640 --> 00:46:25,833
when beauty such as yourself is present.

1025
00:46:27,690 --> 00:46:29,870
- Well, he's not my friend.

1026
00:46:29,870 --> 00:46:31,993
I, I don't know what he wanted.

1027
00:46:31,993 --> 00:46:34,020
- [Yarik] I didn't say that.
- Cool it.

1028
00:46:34,020 --> 00:46:35,130
- Excuse me?

1029
00:46:35,130 --> 00:46:36,360
- I'm truly sorry if my accent

1030
00:46:36,360 --> 00:46:38,430
has caused you concern, fair maiden.

1031
00:46:38,430 --> 00:46:39,830
- I'm sorry for what I said.

1032
00:46:43,571 --> 00:46:44,790
What did I say?

1033
00:46:44,790 --> 00:46:46,200
- [Yarik] I'm truly sorry.

1034
00:46:46,200 --> 00:46:47,033
- Are you okay?

1035
00:46:47,033 --> 00:46:49,260
- [Yarik] For my only intentions
are to follow your wishes

1036
00:46:49,260 --> 00:46:52,680
in the hopes of one fine day
in the not too distant future,

1037
00:46:52,680 --> 00:46:54,525
when I might find a bonding of such a-

1038
00:46:54,525 --> 00:46:55,943
- Excuse me.
- Both our souls

1039
00:46:55,943 --> 00:46:59,190
singing like nightingales
under the brightest moon

1040
00:46:59,190 --> 00:47:00,690
might join together.

1041
00:47:00,690 --> 00:47:02,610
- Excuse me, Shakespeare.

1042
00:47:02,610 --> 00:47:04,514
Are you trying to help me or what?

1043
00:47:04,514 --> 00:47:05,347
- Oh.

1044
00:47:07,500 --> 00:47:09,227
- Speak English.

1045
00:47:09,227 --> 00:47:12,177
- I was...

1046
00:47:12,177 --> 00:47:13,590
- I'm sorry.

1047
00:47:13,590 --> 00:47:14,427
- [Yarik] I'm a jerk.

1048
00:47:14,427 --> 00:47:15,663
- I'm a jerk.

1049
00:47:19,601 --> 00:47:21,767
I, I guess I, I was a jerk,

1050
00:47:23,430 --> 00:47:26,390
but I, I really don't
hang out with those guys.

1051
00:47:26,390 --> 00:47:27,900
I, I just met 'em.

1052
00:47:27,900 --> 00:47:29,340
- [Yarik] I would take
the greatest of pleasures

1053
00:47:29,340 --> 00:47:31,980
in escorting you to
the joust some evening.

1054
00:47:31,980 --> 00:47:33,630
- You wanna see a movie sometime?

1055
00:47:35,310 --> 00:47:36,570
- Sure.

1056
00:47:36,570 --> 00:47:37,403
That'd be great.

1057
00:47:38,790 --> 00:47:41,190
- Hey, Billy boy, there's my number one.

1058
00:47:41,190 --> 00:47:43,443
I got big plans for you today.

1059
00:47:45,000 --> 00:47:45,963
- Not friends, huh?

1060
00:47:47,670 --> 00:47:49,593
- No, Toni, we're dance partners.

1061
00:47:52,080 --> 00:47:53,700
What's the matter, Toni?

1062
00:47:53,700 --> 00:47:54,840
You don't wanna dance with me?

1063
00:47:54,840 --> 00:47:56,081
What, are you afraid of men?

1064
00:47:56,081 --> 00:47:57,874
- You're always trying to show
how strong and tough you are,

1065
00:47:57,874 --> 00:48:00,450
but all you're showing is
how weak and stupid you are!

1066
00:48:00,450 --> 00:48:01,283
- Well, I'm weak?

1067
00:48:01,283 --> 00:48:03,570
- You wanna know what
strength is, it's like my dad:

1068
00:48:03,570 --> 00:48:05,463
to get a job, to be
able to take care of us;

1069
00:48:05,463 --> 00:48:07,800
even when he has hard
times, not to give up.

1070
00:48:07,800 --> 00:48:10,323
That's what strength
is, not scaring people.

1071
00:48:12,809 --> 00:48:14,976
- You know she's crazy
about both of us, don't you?

1072
00:48:14,976 --> 00:48:15,840
(Billy chuckles)

1073
00:48:15,840 --> 00:48:17,160
Well, forget about her.

1074
00:48:17,160 --> 00:48:19,530
Friends are what counts.

1075
00:48:19,530 --> 00:48:21,633
Now, don't say a word.

1076
00:48:22,830 --> 00:48:23,663
Here.

1077
00:48:23,663 --> 00:48:25,860
I know you haven't been
jumped in yet, but, um,

1078
00:48:25,860 --> 00:48:26,817
I want you to have this.

1079
00:48:26,817 --> 00:48:28,113
The boys want you in.

1080
00:48:29,190 --> 00:48:30,240
- Really?

1081
00:48:30,240 --> 00:48:31,590
- Yeah, it's a big deal.

1082
00:48:31,590 --> 00:48:32,423
Come on.

1083
00:48:33,450 --> 00:48:37,420
- Clyde, I don't know if
this is such a good idea.

1084
00:48:37,420 --> 00:48:38,310
- Thank me later.

1085
00:48:38,310 --> 00:48:39,780
Come on.

1086
00:48:39,780 --> 00:48:40,613
- Clyde.

1087
00:48:41,680 --> 00:48:43,860
- What? What, you got a date or something?

1088
00:48:43,860 --> 00:48:44,763
Come on!

1089
00:48:48,450 --> 00:48:49,283
- [Yarik] Billy.

1090
00:48:50,940 --> 00:48:51,773
Billy?

1091
00:48:55,320 --> 00:48:56,153
- Woo.

1092
00:48:57,330 --> 00:48:59,045
I thought I missed the bus.

1093
00:48:59,045 --> 00:48:59,982
- No.

1094
00:48:59,982 --> 00:49:02,508
(engine droning)

1095
00:49:02,508 --> 00:49:03,990
- Hi.
- Hey.

1096
00:49:03,990 --> 00:49:05,140
- You want some coffee?

1097
00:49:06,030 --> 00:49:07,290
- No.
- I don't wanna spill it

1098
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:09,115
before I get on the bus.

1099
00:49:09,115 --> 00:49:12,327
Ah, where are my cigarettes.

1100
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:13,377
You want a cigarette?

1101
00:49:14,370 --> 00:49:15,570
- No thanks.

1102
00:49:15,570 --> 00:49:17,220
- Mm.

1103
00:49:17,220 --> 00:49:18,053
Pickle?

1104
00:49:19,276 --> 00:49:20,553
Eh, high in salt.

1105
00:49:21,990 --> 00:49:23,220
It's the first time I've seen you smile

1106
00:49:23,220 --> 00:49:24,920
since you've started at the diner.

1107
00:49:26,520 --> 00:49:28,920
- I have a lot on my mind.

1108
00:49:28,920 --> 00:49:29,753
- Don't we all?

1109
00:49:31,680 --> 00:49:32,790
I know it's not easy,

1110
00:49:32,790 --> 00:49:35,760
a single mom raising a kid all on her own.

1111
00:49:35,760 --> 00:49:38,340
It's a small diner, people talk.

1112
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:41,430
Besides, we're all in the same boat.

1113
00:49:41,430 --> 00:49:42,880
I mean, I have two of my own.

1114
00:49:44,970 --> 00:49:47,160
Listen, if you ever wanna talk, I'm here.

1115
00:49:47,160 --> 00:49:48,903
I don't gossip.

1116
00:49:55,380 --> 00:49:56,213
So what happened?

1117
00:49:56,213 --> 00:49:58,593
I mean, was he in bed with everybody?

1118
00:49:59,730 --> 00:50:01,230
What, was he sleeping around wit everybody

1119
00:50:01,230 --> 00:50:02,310
and then you throw him out?

1120
00:50:02,310 --> 00:50:03,410
Is that what happened?

1121
00:50:07,860 --> 00:50:08,943
Was he a wife beater?

1122
00:50:09,960 --> 00:50:10,793
Is that it?

1123
00:50:10,793 --> 00:50:11,626
He beat you?

1124
00:50:13,050 --> 00:50:14,090
I don't know what...

1125
00:50:14,940 --> 00:50:17,880
Why do we always love the
ones who hurt us the most?

1126
00:50:17,880 --> 00:50:18,713
I don't know.

1127
00:50:18,713 --> 00:50:19,546
Is it, is it women?

1128
00:50:19,546 --> 00:50:21,000
I mean, we love them,

1129
00:50:21,000 --> 00:50:21,900
we leave them.

1130
00:50:21,900 --> 00:50:23,583
We love them, we go back to them.

1131
00:50:25,170 --> 00:50:27,213
It's our own fault, I guess, it's women.

1132
00:50:29,357 --> 00:50:32,100
Well, at least I got you to smile.

1133
00:50:32,100 --> 00:50:33,200
You have a nice smile.

1134
00:50:35,358 --> 00:50:38,610
(pensive music)

1135
00:50:38,610 --> 00:50:40,210
- I'm just worried about my kid.

1136
00:50:46,735 --> 00:50:48,082
(suspenseful music)

1137
00:50:48,082 --> 00:50:49,440
- I got a bad feeling about this.

1138
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:50,670
- What, are you chicken?

1139
00:50:50,670 --> 00:50:51,503
- No.

1140
00:50:52,710 --> 00:50:53,543
- Come on.

1141
00:50:53,543 --> 00:50:55,860
It's just a couple cans of spray paint.

1142
00:50:55,860 --> 00:50:57,653
Besides, who's gonna gonna miss 'em?

1143
00:50:58,560 --> 00:50:59,613
You're one of us now.

1144
00:51:00,930 --> 00:51:01,920
- Come on, Billy.

1145
00:51:01,920 --> 00:51:03,829
Time to earn that jacket.

1146
00:51:03,829 --> 00:51:06,746
(vehicles droning)

1147
00:51:21,055 --> 00:51:24,388
(door creeks and slams)

1148
00:51:27,150 --> 00:51:28,250
- Can I help you, son?

1149
00:51:30,579 --> 00:51:31,468
- No, no, sir.

1150
00:51:31,468 --> 00:51:32,301
No.

1151
00:51:32,301 --> 00:51:33,153
No, thank you.

1152
00:52:00,180 --> 00:52:02,040
- [Yarik] Isn't that jacket
just smashing, Billy?

1153
00:52:02,040 --> 00:52:03,903
They'll love it in juvenile hall.

1154
00:52:09,720 --> 00:52:10,980
If you really want to impress him,

1155
00:52:10,980 --> 00:52:12,845
why not take two?

1156
00:52:12,845 --> 00:52:13,980
Or three.

1157
00:52:13,980 --> 00:52:14,813
Or four.

1158
00:52:14,813 --> 00:52:16,080
Her, have another,

1159
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:17,080
have another, Billy.

1160
00:52:17,970 --> 00:52:19,703
Look, why don't you take the whole lot?

1161
00:52:19,703 --> 00:52:22,517
That's, that's sure to impress the lad.

1162
00:52:24,045 --> 00:52:25,260
- Hey, what's going on here, huh?

1163
00:52:25,260 --> 00:52:26,793
What's going on, big guy?

1164
00:52:28,380 --> 00:52:30,870
- The, uh, dis, display fell over.

1165
00:52:30,870 --> 00:52:33,120
- Oh, the display fell over.

1166
00:52:33,120 --> 00:52:35,400
Well, you know, that
stuff happens sometimes.

1167
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:37,887
Well, do you think you can put
these back where they were?

1168
00:52:37,887 --> 00:52:39,496
- Y, yes, sir.

1169
00:52:39,496 --> 00:52:42,346
- You think you can put 'em
back exactly where they were?

1170
00:52:43,470 --> 00:52:44,303
- Yes, yes, sir.

1171
00:52:44,303 --> 00:52:45,870
- How about you give it a try.

1172
00:52:45,870 --> 00:52:46,998
Go ahead.

1173
00:52:46,998 --> 00:52:49,831
(cans clattering)

1174
00:52:53,220 --> 00:52:54,360
- What's taking so long, man?

1175
00:52:54,360 --> 00:52:55,950
We thought you were caught.

1176
00:52:55,950 --> 00:52:58,313
- This is stupid. I'm not
going through with it.

1177
00:53:00,150 --> 00:53:01,816
- All right. Don't worry
about it, little buddy.

1178
00:53:01,816 --> 00:53:02,760
You'll get another chance.

1179
00:53:02,760 --> 00:53:04,060
Let's get outta here, man.

1180
00:53:11,760 --> 00:53:14,043
- Hey. (whistles)

1181
00:53:14,043 --> 00:53:15,570
You an artist, homes?

1182
00:53:15,570 --> 00:53:16,503
- No.
- No?

1183
00:53:18,507 --> 00:53:19,340
Then why do you need this, huh?

1184
00:53:21,120 --> 00:53:22,770
- Uh, I-
- Yeah.

1185
00:53:22,770 --> 00:53:23,603
- I, I didn't-
- You know what?

1186
00:53:23,603 --> 00:53:24,810
I've had enough of you guys.

1187
00:53:24,810 --> 00:53:25,890
Now you're gonna wait in the back with me

1188
00:53:25,890 --> 00:53:26,981
while I call your parents.

1189
00:53:26,981 --> 00:53:27,814
Let's go.

1190
00:53:27,814 --> 00:53:29,973
- Well, he did something
really bad, huh, Mom?

1191
00:53:31,728 --> 00:53:32,561
- Unreal.

1192
00:53:34,063 --> 00:53:35,733
Come here, don't stare.

1193
00:53:36,750 --> 00:53:37,770
You're right, that was bad.

1194
00:53:37,770 --> 00:53:40,540
You should never do something like that.

1195
00:53:40,540 --> 00:53:42,566
- What did you think was gonna happen?

1196
00:53:42,566 --> 00:53:44,583
What? I'm talking to you!

1197
00:53:44,583 --> 00:53:46,334
What were you even thinking of?

1198
00:53:46,334 --> 00:53:47,696
- Listen to me.

1199
00:53:47,696 --> 00:53:49,350
I said I didn't do it.

1200
00:53:49,350 --> 00:53:50,820
- I don't wanna talk about this anymore.

1201
00:53:50,820 --> 00:53:51,960
Go to your room.

1202
00:53:51,960 --> 00:53:52,793
- If Dad were here,

1203
00:53:52,793 --> 00:53:53,823
he'd understand.

1204
00:54:01,293 --> 00:54:04,043
(birds chirping)

1205
00:54:07,481 --> 00:54:10,148
(pensive music)

1206
00:54:51,750 --> 00:54:52,583
- Ah, come on, Billy.

1207
00:54:52,583 --> 00:54:54,330
It was a joke.

1208
00:54:54,330 --> 00:54:57,450
You know, Riordan's always
pulling the stunts like that.

1209
00:54:57,450 --> 00:54:59,750
- Yeah, it was like a
test of merit, you know?

1210
00:55:00,696 --> 00:55:02,013
- It wasn't very funny.

1211
00:55:03,270 --> 00:55:04,103
- Hey!

1212
00:55:04,972 --> 00:55:09,972
Get 'em!

1213
00:55:12,060 --> 00:55:12,990
- Billy, come on!

1214
00:55:12,990 --> 00:55:13,823
Hurry up!

1215
00:55:16,350 --> 00:55:18,090
- I've seen their kind before.

1216
00:55:18,090 --> 00:55:19,080
You stay in their company,

1217
00:55:19,080 --> 00:55:21,153
I predict nothing but bad times ahead.

1218
00:55:33,270 --> 00:55:35,400
- Well, you're in a gang.

1219
00:55:35,400 --> 00:55:36,783
- Are you a daft, boy?

1220
00:55:38,100 --> 00:55:38,933
- No.

1221
00:55:38,933 --> 00:55:42,150
I mean, the knight of Order of...

1222
00:55:42,150 --> 00:55:43,500
Well, something,

1223
00:55:43,500 --> 00:55:44,940
whatever you call it.

1224
00:55:44,940 --> 00:55:46,080
- Of Fallon.

1225
00:55:46,080 --> 00:55:48,090
And I'd hardly call it a gang.

1226
00:55:48,090 --> 00:55:49,950
- Well, what would you call it then?

1227
00:55:49,950 --> 00:55:53,370
A bunch of guys hanging
out in their castle?

1228
00:55:53,370 --> 00:55:55,140
You all wear the same clothes,

1229
00:55:55,140 --> 00:55:56,343
and you're all friends,

1230
00:55:57,180 --> 00:55:59,280
and you always have
somebody to watch your back.

1231
00:55:59,280 --> 00:56:00,630
- We're bound by honor,

1232
00:56:00,630 --> 00:56:01,650
a spirit of purpose,

1233
00:56:01,650 --> 00:56:03,450
a vow to help those in need,

1234
00:56:03,450 --> 00:56:05,433
not steal, terrorize and destroy.

1235
00:56:07,830 --> 00:56:09,120
If you wanna belong to something,

1236
00:56:09,120 --> 00:56:10,740
why not make it your own family?

1237
00:56:10,740 --> 00:56:12,180
- [Billy] I don't have a family.

1238
00:56:12,180 --> 00:56:13,800
- [Yarik] You have a mother who loves you.

1239
00:56:13,800 --> 00:56:14,633
- [Billy] Yeah.

1240
00:56:14,633 --> 00:56:16,320
Well, she sure does have
a funny way of showing it.

1241
00:56:16,320 --> 00:56:18,210
- [Yarik] You have a
lot to learn about love.

1242
00:56:18,210 --> 00:56:19,620
- Yeah, well, I don't do anything with her

1243
00:56:19,620 --> 00:56:21,815
and she doesn't do anything with me.

1244
00:56:21,815 --> 00:56:23,380
These are the only friends I have.

1245
00:56:23,380 --> 00:56:26,700
- Well, it seems to me you
don't have any real friends now,

1246
00:56:26,700 --> 00:56:27,600
but you certainly could.

1247
00:56:27,600 --> 00:56:29,100
You're a bright chap,

1248
00:56:29,100 --> 00:56:31,080
and sometimes bright good company

1249
00:56:31,080 --> 00:56:33,662
when you're not whining and
feeling sorry for yourself.

1250
00:56:33,662 --> 00:56:36,098
- [Dice] Help! Somebody!

1251
00:56:36,098 --> 00:56:37,745
- Do you hear that?

1252
00:56:37,745 --> 00:56:38,809
- What?

1253
00:56:38,809 --> 00:56:41,220
- [Dice] Help! (yelling faintly)

1254
00:56:41,220 --> 00:56:42,220
- Over here.

1255
00:56:43,286 --> 00:56:44,554
- [Dice] Help!

1256
00:56:44,554 --> 00:56:45,707
Help, I'm stuck!

1257
00:56:45,707 --> 00:56:46,800
- Do you hear that?

1258
00:56:46,800 --> 00:56:48,465
You hear that, lad?

1259
00:56:48,465 --> 00:56:49,298
- What?

1260
00:56:49,298 --> 00:56:50,131
- [Yarik]] Come here, lad.

1261
00:56:50,131 --> 00:56:53,460
Quickly.
- [Dice] Please, somebody!

1262
00:56:53,460 --> 00:56:54,690
- [Yarik] Look. See?

1263
00:56:54,690 --> 00:56:56,310
Down there, down there.

1264
00:56:56,310 --> 00:56:57,143
You see him?

1265
00:56:57,143 --> 00:57:00,774
- Help me, please!
- He's in trouble.

1266
00:57:00,774 --> 00:57:01,834
Hello?

1267
00:57:01,834 --> 00:57:03,417
- Ace, is that you?

1268
00:57:04,440 --> 00:57:05,940
- Let's get some help.

1269
00:57:05,940 --> 00:57:08,298
- I'm afraid there's no time, Billy.

1270
00:57:08,298 --> 00:57:09,360
- [Ace] Hey!

1271
00:57:09,360 --> 00:57:10,210
- We can do this.

1272
00:57:11,460 --> 00:57:12,690
- Are you nuts?

1273
00:57:12,690 --> 00:57:14,040
I'm not going down there for a kid

1274
00:57:14,040 --> 00:57:15,480
that would just as soon kill me.

1275
00:57:15,480 --> 00:57:17,040
- Billy, there's no time to get help.

1276
00:57:17,040 --> 00:57:18,450
That boy's life is in your hands.

1277
00:57:18,450 --> 00:57:19,583
It's all up to you.

1278
00:57:19,583 --> 00:57:20,947
- [Dice] Help!

1279
00:57:20,947 --> 00:57:22,364
Somebody, please!

1280
00:57:23,998 --> 00:57:24,949
Ace!

1281
00:57:24,949 --> 00:57:26,949
Somebody please help me!

1282
00:57:28,261 --> 00:57:29,212
Somebody!
- Hang on, man,

1283
00:57:29,212 --> 00:57:30,327
I'm coming.

1284
00:57:30,327 --> 00:57:31,818
- [Dice] Hurry, man! Hurry!

1285
00:57:31,818 --> 00:57:34,818
(suspenseful music)

1286
00:57:40,972 --> 00:57:42,722
Please, I'm slipping.

1287
00:57:43,661 --> 00:57:44,494
- Yarik?

1288
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,327
- What is it, lad?

1289
00:57:45,327 --> 00:57:46,620
- How's that leg feeling?

1290
00:57:46,620 --> 00:57:47,978
- Oh, it's getting better by the minute.

1291
00:57:47,978 --> 00:57:49,490
Keep at it, lad.

1292
00:57:49,490 --> 00:57:50,406
(Dice yelling faintly)

1293
00:57:50,406 --> 00:57:52,280
- [Dice] Come on!

1294
00:57:52,280 --> 00:57:54,814
(suspenseful music continues)

1295
00:57:54,814 --> 00:57:56,425
Hurry up!

1296
00:57:56,425 --> 00:57:57,573
Help me out!

1297
00:57:57,573 --> 00:57:59,710
(suspenseful music continues)

1298
00:57:59,710 --> 00:58:01,543
I can't get my leg up!

1299
00:58:02,851 --> 00:58:05,637
(Dice yelling faintly)

1300
00:58:05,637 --> 00:58:09,470
(suspenseful music continues)

1301
00:58:11,446 --> 00:58:14,779
(Dice yelling faintly)

1302
00:58:18,501 --> 00:58:19,532
My arm is weak.

1303
00:58:19,532 --> 00:58:20,365
Grab this arm.

1304
00:58:20,365 --> 00:58:23,069
Grab this part right here.

1305
00:58:23,069 --> 00:58:24,417
(Dice speaking faintly)

1306
00:58:24,417 --> 00:58:26,221
- [Billy] I got you. Swing it up.

1307
00:58:26,221 --> 00:58:29,797
- [Dice] Grab, grab it. (straining)

1308
00:58:29,797 --> 00:58:30,630
Grab it.

1309
00:58:31,729 --> 00:58:33,238
Come on.
- Okay. Uh, uh...

1310
00:58:33,238 --> 00:58:34,410
- Come on, man.

1311
00:58:34,410 --> 00:58:35,533
Do something.

1312
00:58:35,533 --> 00:58:36,366
- All right, see this?

1313
00:58:36,366 --> 00:58:37,199
See this?

1314
00:58:37,199 --> 00:58:38,032
This is the controller.

1315
00:58:38,032 --> 00:58:39,549
We're gonna go up. Can you hang on?

1316
00:58:39,549 --> 00:58:41,051
- I'm just trying to hold on.
- Okay. We're going up.

1317
00:58:41,051 --> 00:58:42,180
Here we go.
- Get us outta here, man.

1318
00:58:42,180 --> 00:58:43,286
(motor whirring)

1319
00:58:43,286 --> 00:58:45,027
(motor clanks)

1320
00:58:45,027 --> 00:58:46,893
Oh, man, what's wrong?

1321
00:58:46,893 --> 00:58:49,445
(suspenseful music)

1322
00:58:49,445 --> 00:58:50,278
- Okay.

1323
00:58:50,278 --> 00:58:52,437
- [Dice] Man, you gotta do something.

1324
00:58:52,437 --> 00:58:54,000
- Now what, dragon slayer?

1325
00:58:54,000 --> 00:58:54,833
We're stuck!

1326
00:58:54,833 --> 00:58:56,164
- [Dice] Who are you calling to?

1327
00:58:56,164 --> 00:58:58,384
- Uh, it's, it's my guard angel.

1328
00:58:58,384 --> 00:58:59,460
Just, just, don't worry about it, okay?

1329
00:58:59,460 --> 00:59:00,930
- Guardian angel?

1330
00:59:00,930 --> 00:59:02,770
That's fine with me.

1331
00:59:02,770 --> 00:59:05,103
- [Yarik] If you can't
climb up, climb down.

1332
00:59:06,120 --> 00:59:09,390
- If we can't climb up, let's climb down.

1333
00:59:09,390 --> 00:59:10,950
You can do that, can't you?

1334
00:59:10,950 --> 00:59:12,810
- [Dice] Yeah, I can do that.

1335
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,733
- [Billy] You can do it.

1336
00:59:14,733 --> 00:59:15,944
I'll go first.

1337
00:59:15,944 --> 00:59:17,550
(suspenseful music)

1338
00:59:17,550 --> 00:59:19,200
You know, you can follow me.

1339
00:59:20,790 --> 00:59:21,887
Don't be afraid.

1340
00:59:23,166 --> 00:59:25,020
You can do it.

1341
00:59:25,020 --> 00:59:25,890
Okay?

1342
00:59:25,890 --> 00:59:27,420
If you need support,

1343
00:59:27,420 --> 00:59:28,563
then use my shoulders.

1344
00:59:30,270 --> 00:59:31,290
And don't look down.

1345
00:59:31,290 --> 00:59:32,400
- All right.

1346
00:59:32,400 --> 00:59:33,900
Hey, man.

1347
00:59:33,900 --> 00:59:35,040
- What? Ow.

1348
00:59:35,040 --> 00:59:38,070
- With our colors and all,
you could have just...

1349
00:59:38,070 --> 00:59:39,240
Hey, thanks.

1350
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,680
Be careful.

1351
00:59:40,680 --> 00:59:42,076
- You too.

1352
00:59:42,076 --> 00:59:44,661
(suspenseful music)

1353
00:59:44,661 --> 00:59:47,640
(Dice straining)

1354
00:59:47,640 --> 00:59:49,005
Okay.

1355
00:59:49,005 --> 00:59:50,490
Put your foot on my shoulders.

1356
00:59:50,490 --> 00:59:51,600
- [Dice] All right.

1357
00:59:51,600 --> 00:59:52,433
Where is it?

1358
00:59:52,433 --> 00:59:55,169
(Billy straining)

1359
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:03,310
- [Billy] Okay. Here we go.

1360
01:00:04,414 --> 01:00:05,706
You're doing fine!

1361
01:00:05,706 --> 01:00:07,956
- [Dice] How are you doing?

1362
01:00:08,796 --> 01:00:09,629
- [Billy] What?

1363
01:00:09,629 --> 01:00:10,803
- [Dice] How are you doing?

1364
01:00:11,777 --> 01:00:14,040
- [Billy] You're fine.
How are you holding up?

1365
01:00:14,040 --> 01:00:15,210
- [Dice] Fine.

1366
01:00:15,210 --> 01:00:16,500
Are we there yet?

1367
01:00:16,500 --> 01:00:18,588
- [Billy] We're almost there.

1368
01:00:18,588 --> 01:00:20,163
- [Dice] Ow!

1369
01:00:20,163 --> 01:00:21,487
Sorry.
- [Billy] It's okay.

1370
01:00:21,487 --> 01:00:23,313
It's okay. I'm okay.

1371
01:00:23,313 --> 01:00:24,402
Are you okay?

1372
01:00:24,402 --> 01:00:25,537
- [Dice] Yeah.

1373
01:00:25,537 --> 01:00:27,787
- [Billy] Okay. We're here.

1374
01:00:29,921 --> 01:00:31,440
Where are we?

1375
01:00:31,440 --> 01:00:33,030
- [Boy] Don't worry, homie.

1376
01:00:33,030 --> 01:00:34,713
We in my territory now.

1377
01:00:38,944 --> 01:00:39,944
- Hey, Dice.

1378
01:00:41,040 --> 01:00:42,570
- Don't worry, you say?

1379
01:00:42,570 --> 01:00:43,620
- Relax.

1380
01:00:43,620 --> 01:00:44,880
I'm gonna take care of you.

1381
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:46,413
- Pack rat, get him!

1382
01:00:47,367 --> 01:00:48,200
- [Boy] Oh, yeah, little Billy, Billy.

1383
01:00:48,200 --> 01:00:50,100
Let's get him.
- Yeah, get that-

1384
01:00:50,100 --> 01:00:51,393
- Ey, yo, hold up, man.

1385
01:00:52,920 --> 01:00:54,923
- Hey, move it, Dice! Move it!

1386
01:00:55,860 --> 01:00:58,003
Look what they did to Psycho.

1387
01:00:58,003 --> 01:01:00,727
(suspenseful music)

1388
01:01:00,727 --> 01:01:03,000
- You, man, he saved my life.

1389
01:01:03,000 --> 01:01:03,930
I owe him, Ace.

1390
01:01:03,930 --> 01:01:05,780
- So do we.
- Hey, back up, back up.

1391
01:01:08,005 --> 01:01:10,518
He saved Dice's life, man.

1392
01:01:10,518 --> 01:01:12,146
I guess we gotta put it up to honor.

1393
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,394
- Honor?

1394
01:01:13,394 --> 01:01:14,410
- What about my honor?

1395
01:01:14,410 --> 01:01:15,337
- Stop, man!

1396
01:01:15,337 --> 01:01:17,397
(suspenseful music)

1397
01:01:17,397 --> 01:01:18,314
Well, hero,

1398
01:01:19,808 --> 01:01:21,985
you saved Dice's life.

1399
01:01:21,985 --> 01:01:23,570
You can say that gets you somewhere,

1400
01:01:23,570 --> 01:01:25,070
so he won't toss you up today.

1401
01:01:26,430 --> 01:01:28,860
But you still owe us for
what they did to Psycho.

1402
01:01:28,860 --> 01:01:29,710
- [Psycho] That's right, Ace.

1403
01:01:29,710 --> 01:01:31,380
- Look, I'm not part of their gang.

1404
01:01:31,380 --> 01:01:34,293
- Ey, man, you travel with
them and you wear their colors,

1405
01:01:35,190 --> 01:01:36,274
that makes you one of them.

1406
01:01:36,274 --> 01:01:37,673
(suspenseful music)

1407
01:01:37,673 --> 01:01:39,030
Listen, man,

1408
01:01:39,030 --> 01:01:41,160
the Snakes demand a fight of honor.

1409
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:43,023
You've got one day slide period.

1410
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,170
At the old warehouse tomorrow afternoon,

1411
01:01:46,170 --> 01:01:48,333
you and Psycho one on one.

1412
01:01:49,470 --> 01:01:51,910
Now get outta here
before I change my mind!

1413
01:01:54,030 --> 01:01:55,440
- I ain't waiting for tomorrow.

1414
01:01:55,440 --> 01:01:56,446
- Hey, Psycho!

1415
01:01:56,446 --> 01:01:59,029
(dog snarling)

1416
01:02:00,240 --> 01:02:02,374
- Tomorrow at the old warehouse!

1417
01:02:02,374 --> 01:02:03,207
You're mine, punk!

1418
01:02:14,321 --> 01:02:15,750
- Hot dog! Bravissimo!

1419
01:02:15,750 --> 01:02:18,060
That was some rescue, boyo.

1420
01:02:18,060 --> 01:02:18,903
Magnificent.

1421
01:02:19,980 --> 01:02:22,050
- Nice of you to pop in now.

1422
01:02:22,050 --> 01:02:24,000
I thought your leg healed and you split.

1423
01:02:24,000 --> 01:02:25,450
- Well, unfortunately for me,

1424
01:02:26,905 --> 01:02:28,410
you're still in need me services.

1425
01:02:28,410 --> 01:02:30,570
- Can I ask you a question?

1426
01:02:30,570 --> 01:02:32,490
- Anything you like, lad.

1427
01:02:32,490 --> 01:02:35,010
- How come the only time
I ever even need you,

1428
01:02:35,010 --> 01:02:37,020
you're know where to be found.

1429
01:02:37,020 --> 01:02:37,890
- But you pulled through,

1430
01:02:37,890 --> 01:02:39,480
rescued the boy, didn't you?

1431
01:02:39,480 --> 01:02:40,895
- Yeah.

1432
01:02:40,895 --> 01:02:43,143
And 20 kids back there
still wanna kill me.

1433
01:02:44,430 --> 01:02:45,750
Thanks for everything.

1434
01:02:45,750 --> 01:02:47,640
- Are you being sarcastic?

1435
01:02:47,640 --> 01:02:48,473
- No.

1436
01:02:49,560 --> 01:02:51,210
- What would you have me do, lad?

1437
01:02:52,170 --> 01:02:53,479
- I don't know. Something.

1438
01:02:53,479 --> 01:02:54,312
Anything.

1439
01:02:55,410 --> 01:02:57,460
What happened to your wish is my command?

1440
01:02:59,280 --> 01:03:00,780
- I think you got your stories confused.

1441
01:03:00,780 --> 01:03:02,103
I'm a knight, not a genie.

1442
01:03:07,260 --> 01:03:09,240
- I'm going to be killed.

1443
01:03:09,240 --> 01:03:10,440
- Don't worry.

1444
01:03:10,440 --> 01:03:12,780
I've seen the fire in your spirit, lad.

1445
01:03:12,780 --> 01:03:14,070
Going over the edge of that bridge,

1446
01:03:14,070 --> 01:03:15,363
'twas a brave deed.

1447
01:03:16,620 --> 01:03:19,322
- I've never thrown a punch in my life.

1448
01:03:19,322 --> 01:03:20,370
I'm going to be slaughtered.

1449
01:03:20,370 --> 01:03:23,040
- Is that all you're
worried about, the fight?

1450
01:03:23,040 --> 01:03:24,676
- No, Yarik.

1451
01:03:24,676 --> 01:03:26,043
I'm afraid of dying too.

1452
01:03:27,360 --> 01:03:28,320
- By Jove!

1453
01:03:28,320 --> 01:03:30,030
It's all come to me now.

1454
01:03:30,030 --> 01:03:32,280
The fates have sent me here now

1455
01:03:32,280 --> 01:03:33,720
to guide the young squire

1456
01:03:33,720 --> 01:03:35,223
along the path of the warrior.

1457
01:03:37,260 --> 01:03:38,936
I'm going to teach you how to fight,

1458
01:03:38,936 --> 01:03:41,250
(birds chirping)

1459
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,230
to stand up for your honor.

1460
01:03:43,230 --> 01:03:44,130
You see?

1461
01:03:44,130 --> 01:03:44,963
Come on. Come on.

1462
01:03:44,963 --> 01:03:46,629
Come on. See? Now, what are you gonna do?

1463
01:03:46,629 --> 01:03:47,462
What are you gonna do?

1464
01:03:47,462 --> 01:03:48,295
Come on at me.

1465
01:03:48,295 --> 01:03:51,033
Come on! Oh boy.

1466
01:03:51,033 --> 01:03:52,590
Now, you see, you see?

1467
01:03:52,590 --> 01:03:54,240
And that's with my bad leg too.

1468
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:55,440
You see what I used

1469
01:03:55,440 --> 01:03:57,060
is your own energy against you,

1470
01:03:57,060 --> 01:03:58,680
that's like reverse force.

1471
01:03:58,680 --> 01:03:59,850
That's a very good strategy

1472
01:03:59,850 --> 01:04:02,490
for a scientific fella like yourself.

1473
01:04:02,490 --> 01:04:04,110
- How about we not fight at all?

1474
01:04:04,110 --> 01:04:05,820
That's a good strategy.

1475
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,710
- Lad, it's a valuable thing, your life.

1476
01:04:07,710 --> 01:04:09,780
It's about about time
you learn to defend it.

1477
01:04:09,780 --> 01:04:10,613
Now get up.

1478
01:04:10,613 --> 01:04:11,790
I'm gonna show you a punch.

1479
01:04:11,790 --> 01:04:12,900
Boom!

1480
01:04:12,900 --> 01:04:14,100
Right in the chest.

1481
01:04:14,100 --> 01:04:15,630
You hit him right here, see?

1482
01:04:15,630 --> 01:04:17,340
Lots of people think in the stomach,

1483
01:04:17,340 --> 01:04:18,173
but it's not true.

1484
01:04:18,173 --> 01:04:20,338
Right there and he'll go (gasping)

1485
01:04:20,338 --> 01:04:22,260
and you'll the tide of the fight.

1486
01:04:22,260 --> 01:04:23,730
Now lets, let's try it here.

1487
01:04:23,730 --> 01:04:25,140
Hit me right in the chest.

1488
01:04:25,140 --> 01:04:26,313
That's how far you have to be,

1489
01:04:26,313 --> 01:04:28,350
it's from your nose to my chest.

1490
01:04:28,350 --> 01:04:29,183
You see?

1491
01:04:29,183 --> 01:04:30,600
- I can never get that close to him.

1492
01:04:31,440 --> 01:04:33,030
- Let's talk about defense.

1493
01:04:33,030 --> 01:04:34,560
Try to hit me.

1494
01:04:34,560 --> 01:04:35,393
Try to hit me.

1495
01:04:35,393 --> 01:04:36,419
Come on, try to hit me.

1496
01:04:36,419 --> 01:04:37,440
Try to hit me again.

1497
01:04:37,440 --> 01:04:38,550
Come on.

1498
01:04:38,550 --> 01:04:39,510
Right here in the chin.

1499
01:04:39,510 --> 01:04:40,830
Can't you hit me?

1500
01:04:40,830 --> 01:04:42,510
Ah, you see, you can't hit me.

1501
01:04:42,510 --> 01:04:44,820
Why? Because I'm using the old pyramid.

1502
01:04:44,820 --> 01:04:46,410
The pyramid, you put your hands together;

1503
01:04:46,410 --> 01:04:48,023
and when he takes the
swing right from here,

1504
01:04:48,023 --> 01:04:50,070
you are gonna move right with him.

1505
01:04:50,070 --> 01:04:50,903
See? Like that.

1506
01:04:50,903 --> 01:04:52,110
Again.

1507
01:04:52,110 --> 01:04:53,790
Go ahead, again.

1508
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:56,304
And then you can do anything
you want with him, you see?

1509
01:04:56,304 --> 01:04:57,513
'Cause he's so confused.

1510
01:04:58,416 --> 01:04:59,249
- I quit!

1511
01:04:59,249 --> 01:05:00,690
- Lad, you can't quit.

1512
01:05:00,690 --> 01:05:02,400
Your honor's at the stake.

1513
01:05:02,400 --> 01:05:06,000
And even if you are
beaten to a bloody pulp,

1514
01:05:06,000 --> 01:05:09,120
you can sleep with the peace
that you fought a man's fight

1515
01:05:09,120 --> 01:05:10,233
for his own dignity.

1516
01:05:11,280 --> 01:05:13,953
- Spoken like a man who's
never been beat up before.

1517
01:05:15,750 --> 01:05:16,583
- On the contrary.

1518
01:05:16,583 --> 01:05:17,430
Billy, I'm a warrior.

1519
01:05:17,430 --> 01:05:20,310
And if it's not the path for you to take,

1520
01:05:20,310 --> 01:05:22,380
it's the only one I know.

1521
01:05:22,380 --> 01:05:23,276
But-

1522
01:05:23,276 --> 01:05:24,420
- [Billy] But?

1523
01:05:24,420 --> 01:05:26,400
- But are you prepared to
walk away from the testament

1524
01:05:26,400 --> 01:05:28,113
knowing that you never even tried?

1525
01:05:29,010 --> 01:05:30,900
- But the guy's three times my size.

1526
01:05:30,900 --> 01:05:32,853
- Men are only small in cowardice.

1527
01:05:36,055 --> 01:05:38,250
(Yarik groans)

1528
01:05:38,250 --> 01:05:39,810
Yeah. Got your pride, didn't it?

1529
01:05:39,810 --> 01:05:40,643
Got your pride.

1530
01:05:40,643 --> 01:05:41,580
Well, you see that?

1531
01:05:41,580 --> 01:05:42,993
Pride is a good thing too.

1532
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,173
Pride is a very important aspect, nope?

1533
01:05:47,879 --> 01:05:50,550
You're a very aggressive
fella, very aggressive.

1534
01:05:50,550 --> 01:05:51,750
I'll have to use every...

1535
01:05:51,750 --> 01:05:52,650
Where are ya?

1536
01:05:52,650 --> 01:05:54,900
I'll have to use everything in my power

1537
01:05:54,900 --> 01:05:57,810
to sustain my survival with you.

1538
01:05:57,810 --> 01:05:59,460
I can see that right now.

1539
01:05:59,460 --> 01:06:00,330
Now I'm coming at you.

1540
01:06:00,330 --> 01:06:01,163
I'm angry, you see?

1541
01:06:01,163 --> 01:06:02,670
You threw me down a couple of times.

1542
01:06:02,670 --> 01:06:04,140
Here I come.

1543
01:06:04,140 --> 01:06:05,025
Watch out!

1544
01:06:05,025 --> 01:06:06,810
(both groan)

1545
01:06:06,810 --> 01:06:08,130
You've done it, lad.

1546
01:06:08,130 --> 01:06:09,210
You've done it!

1547
01:06:09,210 --> 01:06:10,323
You realize that.

1548
01:06:11,680 --> 01:06:13,980
I got a tiger on my hands.

1549
01:06:13,980 --> 01:06:16,380
Back off, you brute.

1550
01:06:16,380 --> 01:06:17,280
Climb up against it.

1551
01:06:17,280 --> 01:06:20,160
Now, but I still have a trick at all

1552
01:06:20,160 --> 01:06:20,993
to throw at you.

1553
01:06:20,993 --> 01:06:23,450
Up here, you dangerous creature.

1554
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:27,548
(uplifting music)

1555
01:06:27,548 --> 01:06:30,540
You know, you just about whipped me, lad.

1556
01:06:30,540 --> 01:06:33,273
I think you're, you're the man of the day.

1557
01:06:34,728 --> 01:06:37,073
(Yarik laughing)

1558
01:06:37,073 --> 01:06:38,487
That's, that's enough.

1559
01:06:38,487 --> 01:06:39,900
- [Billy] Come on. Come on.

1560
01:06:39,900 --> 01:06:41,610
- [Yarik] That's enough, lad.

1561
01:06:41,610 --> 01:06:45,909
Oh, well, we've covered a lot of ground

1562
01:06:45,909 --> 01:06:47,247
in a short period of time,

1563
01:06:47,247 --> 01:06:48,950
and we both seemed to have survived it.

1564
01:06:48,950 --> 01:06:51,246
- [Billy] I just hope
I can remember it all.

1565
01:06:51,246 --> 01:06:53,658
- As you feel the cause is pure,

1566
01:06:53,658 --> 01:06:55,737
(gentle music)

1567
01:06:55,737 --> 01:06:57,870
you feel the righteousness of it;

1568
01:06:57,870 --> 01:06:59,220
that gives you your memory.

1569
01:07:02,760 --> 01:07:03,593
Oh,

1570
01:07:05,211 --> 01:07:06,044
nice going, lad.

1571
01:07:07,851 --> 01:07:10,950
(Yarik sighs)

1572
01:07:10,950 --> 01:07:11,823
Look at me leg.

1573
01:07:11,823 --> 01:07:12,813
Lad, look.

1574
01:07:13,740 --> 01:07:15,290
It's holding. Look, look, look.

1575
01:07:17,796 --> 01:07:18,629
Look.

1576
01:07:22,080 --> 01:07:22,913
I'm telling you,

1577
01:07:22,913 --> 01:07:23,880
you keep moving like this,

1578
01:07:23,880 --> 01:07:25,830
I'll be gone before you know it.

1579
01:07:25,830 --> 01:07:27,270
Look.

1580
01:07:27,270 --> 01:07:29,100
- You'll be gone?

1581
01:07:29,100 --> 01:07:30,300
- Yes, of course.

1582
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,500
Home, lad.

1583
01:07:31,500 --> 01:07:32,850
Katrina's been waiting long enough,

1584
01:07:32,850 --> 01:07:34,980
don't you think? (chuckles)

1585
01:07:34,980 --> 01:07:35,813
- But-

1586
01:07:35,813 --> 01:07:38,130
- You're some fighter, Billy. I tell ya.

1587
01:07:38,130 --> 01:07:40,350
Look, my quest is all but done.

1588
01:07:40,350 --> 01:07:42,975
Look, look at this.
- What if I need you again?

1589
01:07:42,975 --> 01:07:44,725
I mean, you can't go.

1590
01:07:45,807 --> 01:07:47,013
- Oh, I must, son.

1591
01:07:47,940 --> 01:07:50,190
- You're not my father,
don't call me that!

1592
01:07:50,190 --> 01:07:51,772
- Billy.

1593
01:07:51,772 --> 01:07:53,287
- You, you're all the same.

1594
01:07:54,330 --> 01:07:56,010
You say you're here to help me, and then,

1595
01:07:56,010 --> 01:07:58,293
and then you leave when I need you.

1596
01:08:00,210 --> 01:08:01,650
Just like my mom,

1597
01:08:01,650 --> 01:08:03,033
she's trying to leave too.

1598
01:08:04,920 --> 01:08:07,316
I just wish you'd go home now.

1599
01:08:07,316 --> 01:08:10,149
(Billy sniffling)

1600
01:08:19,185 --> 01:08:20,018
Why, Yarik?

1601
01:08:20,018 --> 01:08:20,851
I mean,

1602
01:08:21,990 --> 01:08:23,433
why do you have to go too?

1603
01:08:25,890 --> 01:08:28,041
- Oh, it's not up to me, lad.

1604
01:08:28,041 --> 01:08:31,423
(Billy sniffling)

1605
01:08:31,423 --> 01:08:35,047
- But you taught me to do things, to,

1606
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:41,721
to be brave and to be a man,

1607
01:08:42,933 --> 01:08:45,733
like you're my father, and
now you're leaving too.

1608
01:08:48,510 --> 01:08:49,343
- Oh, laddie.

1609
01:08:50,340 --> 01:08:52,923
How much you must be hiding
under all these tears.

1610
01:08:54,420 --> 01:08:57,300
My time here is but a short while,

1611
01:08:57,300 --> 01:08:59,170
just enough to ease you on your way

1612
01:09:00,240 --> 01:09:02,460
through the season of testament.

1613
01:09:02,460 --> 01:09:03,643
As flattered as I am,

1614
01:09:04,903 --> 01:09:08,250
I wish to God I could have
a son such as yourself.

1615
01:09:08,250 --> 01:09:09,950
You're right, I'm not your father.

1616
01:09:13,019 --> 01:09:15,750
(somber music)

1617
01:09:15,750 --> 01:09:18,503
- The only ones that
really want me are Pack 13.

1618
01:09:21,210 --> 01:09:23,100
- Those misguided wasted childhood?

1619
01:09:23,100 --> 01:09:23,933
I think not.

1620
01:09:27,120 --> 01:09:29,100
They only need you to
make them feel important.

1621
01:09:29,100 --> 01:09:30,350
You are the life, me boy.

1622
01:09:31,470 --> 01:09:33,070
It's time you started living it.

1623
01:09:33,934 --> 01:09:37,351
(somber music continues)

1624
01:09:56,885 --> 01:10:00,468
How long can the two
of you sit in silence.

1625
01:10:07,149 --> 01:10:10,066
(cutlery clatters)

1626
01:10:12,150 --> 01:10:12,983
- Finished?

1627
01:10:14,370 --> 01:10:15,203
- I guess.

1628
01:10:26,236 --> 01:10:29,149
Just like I said, she's already gone.

1629
01:10:29,149 --> 01:10:31,050
- If you don't mind my asking,

1630
01:10:31,050 --> 01:10:32,650
how long has she been like this?

1631
01:10:34,230 --> 01:10:36,450
- Ever since my father died.

1632
01:10:36,450 --> 01:10:38,400
In a lot of ways, it's better this way.

1633
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:39,649
- Rubbish.

1634
01:10:39,649 --> 01:10:41,299
Family should do things together,

1635
01:10:42,360 --> 01:10:43,950
talk things out.

1636
01:10:43,950 --> 01:10:45,717
- I don't need advice from you.

1637
01:10:45,717 --> 01:10:47,580
Now I'm going to bed.

1638
01:10:47,580 --> 01:10:49,140
I've gotta fight for my honor tomorrow,

1639
01:10:49,140 --> 01:10:49,973
thanks to you.

1640
01:10:52,676 --> 01:10:55,343
(pensive music)

1641
01:11:13,750 --> 01:11:15,488
(window squeaks)

1642
01:11:15,488 --> 01:11:18,540
(insects chirping)

1643
01:11:18,540 --> 01:11:19,790
- Couldn't sleep, laddie?

1644
01:11:22,635 --> 01:11:24,113
- I'm sorry about what I said.

1645
01:11:26,187 --> 01:11:27,722
- Oh, well,

1646
01:11:27,722 --> 01:11:29,670
you have a lot on your mind.

1647
01:11:29,670 --> 01:11:30,993
Just remember what I said.

1648
01:11:31,950 --> 01:11:34,300
Keep your heart true,
your conviction's strong,

1649
01:11:35,460 --> 01:11:36,600
and you'll do just fine.

1650
01:11:36,600 --> 01:11:38,050
I'm very proud of you, laddie

1651
01:11:42,660 --> 01:11:43,910
- Thinking about Katrina?

1652
01:11:45,390 --> 01:11:46,223
- Mm.

1653
01:11:48,360 --> 01:11:49,893
Am I so easy to read?

1654
01:11:51,100 --> 01:11:53,010
(Billy chuckles)

1655
01:11:53,010 --> 01:11:53,843
- I'm learning.

1656
01:11:54,780 --> 01:11:55,770
- That you are, laddie,

1657
01:11:55,770 --> 01:11:56,733
that you are.

1658
01:12:01,140 --> 01:12:02,140
- You miss her, huh?

1659
01:12:03,091 --> 01:12:05,141
- With all my heart and with all my soul.

1660
01:12:06,480 --> 01:12:08,100
- Yeah.

1661
01:12:08,100 --> 01:12:10,410
Well, if you're half as good
a teacher as you say you are,

1662
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:11,810
you'll be with her tomorrow.

1663
01:12:13,290 --> 01:12:14,241
I'll try to get some sleep.

1664
01:12:14,241 --> 01:12:15,983
I'm gonna need all the help I can get.

1665
01:12:17,400 --> 01:12:18,776
- Good night, laddie.

1666
01:12:18,776 --> 01:12:20,026
- Night, Yarik.

1667
01:12:21,573 --> 01:12:24,374
(window squeaks)

1668
01:12:24,374 --> 01:12:27,291
(insects chirping)

1669
01:12:33,535 --> 01:12:37,285
(school children chattering)

1670
01:12:55,950 --> 01:12:57,333
What's that on your head?

1671
01:13:00,780 --> 01:13:04,440
- This is me lucky hat.

1672
01:13:04,440 --> 01:13:05,700
- It's not a hat.

1673
01:13:05,700 --> 01:13:06,570
- It is.

1674
01:13:06,570 --> 01:13:09,630
I'll have you know, this hat
has yet to fail me in battle.

1675
01:13:09,630 --> 01:13:11,423
Would you like the word it for luck?

1676
01:13:12,810 --> 01:13:14,909
- Are you out of your mind?

1677
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:16,253
- You don't like it?

1678
01:13:16,253 --> 01:13:17,608
- I hate it.

1679
01:13:17,608 --> 01:13:19,470
- You don't. (chuckles)

1680
01:13:19,470 --> 01:13:20,640
- I do.

1681
01:13:20,640 --> 01:13:22,667
- Ah, Billy, tell me you like me hat.

1682
01:13:23,897 --> 01:13:25,500
- Get away from me.

1683
01:13:25,500 --> 01:13:27,000
- Oh, here comes trouble.

1684
01:13:27,000 --> 01:13:28,170
Tell him to cast off,

1685
01:13:28,170 --> 01:13:29,310
we can handle the scrape alone.

1686
01:13:29,310 --> 01:13:30,143
I mean, together, you know,

1687
01:13:30,143 --> 01:13:30,976
but without him.

1688
01:13:30,976 --> 01:13:32,550
- Hey, Billy boy.

1689
01:13:32,550 --> 01:13:33,690
Where's your colors?

1690
01:13:33,690 --> 01:13:35,370
- I left them at home.

1691
01:13:35,370 --> 01:13:36,630
- Well, we can't worry about that.

1692
01:13:36,630 --> 01:13:38,070
We got other things to go over.

1693
01:13:38,070 --> 01:13:41,100
Those Snakes are going to
learn a lesson the hard way.

1694
01:13:41,100 --> 01:13:43,440
You are just the warmup today, pal .

1695
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:47,020
And after the pre-show,
the real battle begins.

1696
01:13:47,020 --> 01:13:48,540
(suspenseful music)

1697
01:13:48,540 --> 01:13:50,443
- What are you talking about?

1698
01:13:50,443 --> 01:13:52,290
- We've been trying to get those Snakes

1699
01:13:52,290 --> 01:13:54,660
into a face to face for a long time now,

1700
01:13:54,660 --> 01:13:56,693
and you set them up perfectly.

1701
01:13:56,693 --> 01:13:58,169
(suspenseful music)

1702
01:13:58,169 --> 01:13:59,790
- I thought this was a fight about honor,

1703
01:13:59,790 --> 01:14:01,740
not a gang war.

1704
01:14:01,740 --> 01:14:03,453
- Stop living in a fantasy world.

1705
01:14:04,290 --> 01:14:06,543
As soon as one of you go down, we move in.

1706
01:14:07,744 --> 01:14:10,050
We couldn't have done
it without your, buddy.

1707
01:14:10,050 --> 01:14:11,050
We'll see you there.

1708
01:14:11,975 --> 01:14:14,975
(suspenseful music)

1709
01:14:16,920 --> 01:14:17,753
- Good luck.

1710
01:14:20,537 --> 01:14:24,000
(suspenseful music)

1711
01:14:24,000 --> 01:14:24,833
- Billy,

1712
01:14:25,950 --> 01:14:27,240
you prepared well

1713
01:14:27,240 --> 01:14:28,770
and were bravely set to the testament,

1714
01:14:28,770 --> 01:14:30,213
but now you must bow out.

1715
01:14:31,050 --> 01:14:32,580
- But what about my honor?

1716
01:14:32,580 --> 01:14:33,600
- This isn't about honor,

1717
01:14:33,600 --> 01:14:35,250
it has nothing to do with honor.

1718
01:14:35,250 --> 01:14:36,850
You mustn't be a part of it now.

1719
01:14:39,120 --> 01:14:40,570
- Then you'll never get back.

1720
01:14:42,240 --> 01:14:44,520
- Even if it meant I would never return,

1721
01:14:44,520 --> 01:14:45,990
even if that's what it meant,

1722
01:14:45,990 --> 01:14:48,183
I couldn't let you do it and I won't.

1723
01:14:49,970 --> 01:14:53,459
- I don't know what I need to do, Yarik,

1724
01:14:53,459 --> 01:14:55,683
but I need to be there.

1725
01:14:55,683 --> 01:14:59,160
- Billy, if you make this
decision, you'll be alone.

1726
01:14:59,160 --> 01:15:01,313
There isn't any way on
earth I can help you.

1727
01:15:03,245 --> 01:15:05,520
(suspenseful music)

1728
01:15:05,520 --> 01:15:07,120
Billy!

1729
01:15:07,120 --> 01:15:10,953
(suspenseful music continues)

1730
01:15:14,685 --> 01:15:15,518
- Billy!

1731
01:15:16,860 --> 01:15:19,800
Is it true that you're
gonna be in a gang fight?

1732
01:15:19,800 --> 01:15:21,240
- [Billy] Who told you?

1733
01:15:21,240 --> 01:15:22,413
- Everyone's talking.

1734
01:15:23,646 --> 01:15:25,037
It's not true, is it?

1735
01:15:27,427 --> 01:15:28,927
- [Billy] Yeah, it, it's true.

1736
01:15:30,360 --> 01:15:32,850
- But you're not like them.

1737
01:15:32,850 --> 01:15:34,000
You're kind and gentle.

1738
01:15:34,860 --> 01:15:36,840
I know you're a good person.

1739
01:15:36,840 --> 01:15:38,883
Please don't do this.

1740
01:15:41,010 --> 01:15:42,510
- [Billy] My father said once,

1741
01:15:43,537 --> 01:15:45,487
"You can't walk away from a challenge."

1742
01:15:46,890 --> 01:15:47,943
I have to go.

1743
01:15:49,363 --> 01:15:50,613
- But I'm scared for you.

1744
01:15:51,750 --> 01:15:54,990
- I'm scared too. (sighs)

1745
01:15:54,990 --> 01:15:56,583
Why am I telling you this,

1746
01:15:58,020 --> 01:15:59,730
you of all people?

1747
01:15:59,730 --> 01:16:01,030
- Because you know I care.

1748
01:16:03,090 --> 01:16:05,280
Can I do anything to stop you?

1749
01:16:05,280 --> 01:16:06,930
There must be something I can do.

1750
01:16:08,040 --> 01:16:09,090
- Maybe say a prayer?

1751
01:16:16,710 --> 01:16:17,890
- Billy, be careful.

1752
01:16:25,155 --> 01:16:27,822
(pensive music)

1753
01:17:12,729 --> 01:17:15,146
(door slams)

1754
01:17:17,272 --> 01:17:20,272
(suspenseful music)

1755
01:17:45,453 --> 01:17:47,490
- This isn't right, Clyde.

1756
01:17:47,490 --> 01:17:49,440
You said a fair fight.

1757
01:17:49,440 --> 01:17:50,890
I can't go through with this.

1758
01:17:52,410 --> 01:17:54,090
- Don't do this to me, Billy.

1759
01:17:54,090 --> 01:17:55,680
- What are you guys doing here?

1760
01:17:55,680 --> 01:17:56,931
You can't come in.

1761
01:17:56,931 --> 01:17:58,773
- We can't come in?
- We have to.

1762
01:17:59,797 --> 01:18:01,200
- Man, hide in the back.

1763
01:18:01,200 --> 01:18:02,033
Be quiet.

1764
01:18:03,270 --> 01:18:04,359
- What the hell do you think those Snakes

1765
01:18:04,359 --> 01:18:06,930
are gonna to you anyways, huh?

1766
01:18:06,930 --> 01:18:10,530
Psycho there is gonna cut
you up into little pieces.

1767
01:18:10,530 --> 01:18:12,390
- You gotta take him quick, Psycho.

1768
01:18:12,390 --> 01:18:13,223
- Do it.

1769
01:18:14,940 --> 01:18:16,080
- Yo, Clyde,

1770
01:18:16,080 --> 01:18:17,340
no weapons, no interference,

1771
01:18:17,340 --> 01:18:19,350
don't touch my-
- Yeah, we know the rules.

1772
01:18:19,350 --> 01:18:20,500
- Let's get it on then.

1773
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:27,150
(suspenseful music)

1774
01:18:27,150 --> 01:18:28,568
- Purple and green.

1775
01:18:28,568 --> 01:18:29,401
- Gold!

1776
01:18:30,852 --> 01:18:32,602
- [Gang Members] War!

1777
01:18:34,090 --> 01:18:35,160
- Now's the time, lad,

1778
01:18:35,160 --> 01:18:36,153
the breath stopper.

1779
01:18:37,388 --> 01:18:39,970
- Psycho, we can call this off.

1780
01:18:39,970 --> 01:18:41,923
- I want you, fool.

1781
01:18:41,923 --> 01:18:45,340
(gang members clamoring)

1782
01:18:50,204 --> 01:18:53,343
You're not gonna fight at all, are you?

1783
01:18:53,343 --> 01:18:55,229
(Billy thuds)

1784
01:18:55,229 --> 01:18:58,646
(gang members clamoring)

1785
01:19:11,716 --> 01:19:14,012
- The pyramid, the...

1786
01:19:14,012 --> 01:19:17,429
(gang members clamoring)

1787
01:19:19,457 --> 01:19:20,592
That's it.

1788
01:19:20,592 --> 01:19:24,009
(gang members clamoring)

1789
01:19:35,529 --> 01:19:37,822
- [Gang Member] Come on, fight!

1790
01:19:37,822 --> 01:19:41,239
(gang members clamoring)

1791
01:19:43,982 --> 01:19:45,618
- [Gang Member] Come on, Psycho!

1792
01:19:45,618 --> 01:19:47,925
(gang members clamoring)

1793
01:19:47,925 --> 01:19:48,774
- Move!

1794
01:19:48,774 --> 01:19:50,525
- [Ace] Hey, I told you
not to touch him, Clyde.

1795
01:19:50,525 --> 01:19:52,074
- [Clyde] Yeah, right.

1796
01:19:52,074 --> 01:19:53,202
- [Ace] That ain't the way we do it.

1797
01:19:53,202 --> 01:19:54,035
- [Clyde] What, Ace?

1798
01:19:54,035 --> 01:19:54,868
I ain't doing nothing.

1799
01:19:54,868 --> 01:19:56,730
- Hey, you crossed the line.

1800
01:19:56,730 --> 01:19:57,563
- Yeah, sure.

1801
01:19:57,563 --> 01:19:58,573
We owe you one.

1802
01:19:59,479 --> 01:20:00,312
Go ahead.

1803
01:20:01,447 --> 01:20:02,280
- Reverse.

1804
01:20:03,374 --> 01:20:04,696
Reverse force.

1805
01:20:04,696 --> 01:20:08,113
(gang members clamoring)

1806
01:20:09,421 --> 01:20:11,629
That's a new one. We'll
call it the cannon ball.

1807
01:20:11,629 --> 01:20:15,046
(gang members clamoring)

1808
01:20:22,902 --> 01:20:25,169
(punch thuds)

1809
01:20:25,169 --> 01:20:28,586
(gang members clamoring)

1810
01:20:32,678 --> 01:20:34,207
Pyramid.

1811
01:20:34,207 --> 01:20:36,030
(punch thuds)
(Billy groans)

1812
01:20:36,030 --> 01:20:36,863
Oops.

1813
01:20:37,726 --> 01:20:41,476
(Psycho and Billy straining)

1814
01:20:43,927 --> 01:20:45,537
- Ah, you bit me, man.

1815
01:20:45,537 --> 01:20:46,370
What are you?

1816
01:20:46,370 --> 01:20:47,203
An animal?

1817
01:20:47,203 --> 01:20:48,561
- [Billy] Yes.

1818
01:20:48,561 --> 01:20:51,978
(gang members clamoring)

1819
01:20:59,113 --> 01:21:00,249
(Psycho gasps)

1820
01:21:00,249 --> 01:21:01,391
- That's it.

1821
01:21:01,391 --> 01:21:03,129
- That was my breath stopper.

1822
01:21:03,129 --> 01:21:05,879
- Psycho, Psycho, take the stick.

1823
01:21:08,019 --> 01:21:09,603
- Here, take this.

1824
01:21:09,603 --> 01:21:12,500
(gang members clamoring)

1825
01:21:12,500 --> 01:21:13,986
(chain rattles)

1826
01:21:13,986 --> 01:21:17,403
(gang members clamoring)

1827
01:21:42,071 --> 01:21:44,057
- Do it, come on!

1828
01:21:44,057 --> 01:21:45,032
- [Gang Members] Do it!

1829
01:21:45,032 --> 01:21:46,756
Do it! Do it!

1830
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:51,756
- What's the matter with you, people?

1831
01:21:52,683 --> 01:21:56,383
Am I the only one here that
can see how stupid this is?

1832
01:21:58,735 --> 01:22:01,402
(Billy panting)

1833
01:22:02,340 --> 01:22:04,173
This isn't a fight about honor.

1834
01:22:07,320 --> 01:22:09,843
This isn't a fight about respect or space.

1835
01:22:13,500 --> 01:22:14,613
- They owe us.

1836
01:22:15,450 --> 01:22:16,440
- Nothing.

1837
01:22:16,440 --> 01:22:18,590
They owe us nothing
and we deserve nothing.

1838
01:22:19,860 --> 01:22:22,233
- My father's dead now because of a fight,

1839
01:22:23,247 --> 01:22:24,747
and it didn't bring him honor.

1840
01:22:25,770 --> 01:22:27,220
It didn't bring him anything.

1841
01:22:28,260 --> 01:22:29,960
I didn't fight for my honor today,

1842
01:22:33,109 --> 01:22:34,653
I saved it by stopping.

1843
01:22:36,930 --> 01:22:39,030
I don't need your respect,

1844
01:22:39,030 --> 01:22:40,573
loyalty or anything.

1845
01:22:44,958 --> 01:22:47,708
(boxes thudding)

1846
01:22:50,045 --> 01:22:51,545
- Well, I'll be...

1847
01:22:53,321 --> 01:22:54,154
(Clyde scoffs)

1848
01:22:54,154 --> 01:22:56,790
- Nah, he wasn't part of Pack 13 anyways.

1849
01:22:56,790 --> 01:22:59,040
- Yeah, the fight was a bust, Clyde.

1850
01:22:59,040 --> 01:23:00,450
- Oh yeah?

1851
01:23:00,450 --> 01:23:02,610
The fight is on!

1852
01:23:02,610 --> 01:23:05,730
- Anyone who wants to
leave can do so right now.

1853
01:23:05,730 --> 01:23:08,643
- Anyone who wants to
leave can do so right now.

1854
01:23:09,717 --> 01:23:10,895
- [Gang Members] What?

1855
01:23:10,895 --> 01:23:11,812
What? What?

1856
01:23:21,480 --> 01:23:22,950
- But, uh,

1857
01:23:22,950 --> 01:23:25,410
anyone who wants to stay and finish this

1858
01:23:25,410 --> 01:23:27,424
can stay and fight right now!

1859
01:23:27,424 --> 01:23:28,665
- [Gang Members] Yeah!

1860
01:23:28,665 --> 01:23:30,461
- Let's go!
- Let's do it.

1861
01:23:30,461 --> 01:23:33,878
(gang members clamoring)

1862
01:23:44,202 --> 01:23:46,014
- You did it, boyo!

1863
01:23:46,014 --> 01:23:47,580
I knew you had it in you.

1864
01:23:47,580 --> 01:23:48,413
- Yeah?

1865
01:23:48,413 --> 01:23:50,490
I wasn't too sure about it myself.

1866
01:23:50,490 --> 01:23:51,900
- Warrior that I am,

1867
01:23:51,900 --> 01:23:53,940
you taught me a thing or two today.

1868
01:23:53,940 --> 01:23:55,320
- Really? What's that?

1869
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:58,350
- Sometimes it takes far
more courage and bravery

1870
01:23:58,350 --> 01:23:59,850
to sheath the the sword than to wield it.

1871
01:23:59,850 --> 01:24:01,410
Congratulations.

1872
01:24:01,410 --> 01:24:02,520
- Thanks.

1873
01:24:02,520 --> 01:24:03,353
- Wait up, lad.

1874
01:24:05,460 --> 01:24:07,610
- I can't imagine what
more there is to do.

1875
01:24:08,759 --> 01:24:10,650
- It's getting worse, isn't it?

1876
01:24:10,650 --> 01:24:11,636
- Billy!

1877
01:24:11,636 --> 01:24:12,959
- [Boy] Hey Billy, we seen you.

1878
01:24:12,959 --> 01:24:14,036
- [Girl] We were there.

1879
01:24:14,036 --> 01:24:14,869
- [Boy] You were great.

1880
01:24:14,869 --> 01:24:16,710
- All is not lost, boyo.

1881
01:24:16,710 --> 01:24:17,973
This could be the one.

1882
01:24:19,740 --> 01:24:21,690
Don't get we'll get shy on me now, lad.

1883
01:24:22,724 --> 01:24:23,974
Here she comes.

1884
01:24:25,857 --> 01:24:27,663
- I saw your fight today.

1885
01:24:29,100 --> 01:24:29,940
- You did?

1886
01:24:29,940 --> 01:24:32,130
- And I heard what you said.

1887
01:24:32,130 --> 01:24:33,300
- Oh.

1888
01:24:33,300 --> 01:24:37,683
- Well I, I thought you were very brave.

1889
01:24:38,640 --> 01:24:40,110
- Oh, not really.

1890
01:24:40,110 --> 01:24:41,040
- Yes, you were.

1891
01:24:42,990 --> 01:24:44,403
You were wonderful.

1892
01:24:45,240 --> 01:24:48,470
And everyone knows it.

1893
01:24:48,470 --> 01:24:51,420
Do you think maybe we could
sit together at lunch tomorrow?

1894
01:24:52,699 --> 01:24:53,532
- Yes.

1895
01:24:53,532 --> 01:24:54,365
- Yes. Yes.

1896
01:24:55,920 --> 01:24:57,370
- Well, great!

1897
01:24:57,370 --> 01:24:59,373
Then, then I'll see you there.

1898
01:24:59,373 --> 01:25:01,195
- Bye.
- Great.

1899
01:25:01,195 --> 01:25:02,820
Great.
- Bye

1900
01:25:02,820 --> 01:25:03,653
- Bye.

1901
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:07,373
Yes!

1902
01:25:07,373 --> 01:25:08,206
- Yes!

1903
01:25:08,206 --> 01:25:09,712
- Oh, are you okay?

1904
01:25:12,672 --> 01:25:15,523
(Yarik chuckles)

1905
01:25:15,523 --> 01:25:18,393
- I just can't figure it, can you?

1906
01:25:20,250 --> 01:25:22,913
- No, no, I can't.

1907
01:25:28,470 --> 01:25:30,150
- Well, downtown was the scene

1908
01:25:30,150 --> 01:25:33,180
of another serious incident
this afternoon, gang related,

1909
01:25:33,180 --> 01:25:34,530
young gang related.

1910
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:38,160
12-year-olds, 13-year-olds,
wounded, bloodshed.

1911
01:25:38,160 --> 01:25:40,200
Two ended up in the
County General Hospital.

1912
01:25:40,200 --> 01:25:43,320
Some say it's because of the
family values falling apart,

1913
01:25:43,320 --> 01:25:45,450
others say we need more
police on the streets.

1914
01:25:45,450 --> 01:25:48,691
Anyway, this is Sam Weinberg
sending it back to you, Pam.

1915
01:25:48,691 --> 01:25:51,358
(pensive music)

1916
01:25:54,750 --> 01:25:57,903
- I need the number for County
General Hospital, please.

1917
01:25:59,163 --> 01:26:02,663
(pensive music continues)

1918
01:26:03,763 --> 01:26:06,822
(Yarik groaning)

1919
01:26:06,822 --> 01:26:08,550
- Oh, oh, oh, oh.

1920
01:26:08,550 --> 01:26:09,383
Ooh.

1921
01:26:12,036 --> 01:26:12,869
Oh.

1922
01:26:15,977 --> 01:26:18,153
Ah, it seems I can't go no further, lad.

1923
01:26:19,283 --> 01:26:22,170
- [Billy] I don't know
what else to do, Yarik.

1924
01:26:22,170 --> 01:26:24,470
I mean, are you stuck
here till I'm president?

1925
01:26:25,410 --> 01:26:27,003
- Look at your mother's face.

1926
01:26:27,857 --> 01:26:28,993
- I mean, if we're up to me,

1927
01:26:28,993 --> 01:26:31,580
I'd have you back in your own world.

1928
01:26:31,580 --> 01:26:33,830
I know how much you miss her.
- Look, look at your mother.

1929
01:26:35,040 --> 01:26:37,320
I understand her very well, you know?

1930
01:26:37,320 --> 01:26:39,060
Her feeding of lost love.

1931
01:26:39,060 --> 01:26:41,283
Look, she's holding his picture.

1932
01:26:44,790 --> 01:26:46,590
- She must miss my dad an awful lot.

1933
01:26:47,610 --> 01:26:49,560
- To be separated from your
love is a horrible thing,

1934
01:26:49,560 --> 01:26:51,110
I wouldn't wish it upon a soul.

1935
01:26:54,660 --> 01:26:56,580
- Look, if you need Katrina so badly,

1936
01:26:56,580 --> 01:26:58,580
then why doesn't she just come here too?

1937
01:27:01,380 --> 01:27:02,663
Didn't you say that if the need is great

1938
01:27:02,663 --> 01:27:04,473
and the subject is worthy?

1939
01:27:05,580 --> 01:27:07,530
It looks to me like you need her badly.

1940
01:27:09,150 --> 01:27:11,580
- But it's your need that's
important here, laddie,

1941
01:27:11,580 --> 01:27:12,413
not mine.

1942
01:27:13,350 --> 01:27:15,660
- Well, then I won't
need anybody ever again.

1943
01:27:15,660 --> 01:27:17,160
'Cause what does it get you?

1944
01:27:17,160 --> 01:27:18,333
My father back?

1945
01:27:19,230 --> 01:27:22,320
It doesn't get anything
but hurt and being alone.

1946
01:27:22,320 --> 01:27:23,160
- Billy, you're not alone.

1947
01:27:23,160 --> 01:27:25,050
Don't you ever say that, lad.

1948
01:27:25,050 --> 01:27:27,630
The pain you feel for him now is dreadful,

1949
01:27:27,630 --> 01:27:29,040
but it's infinitely better

1950
01:27:29,040 --> 01:27:30,840
than never having felt love at all.

1951
01:27:30,840 --> 01:27:34,016
You carry your father's love
with you wherever you go.

1952
01:27:34,016 --> 01:27:35,370
You just can't feel it or feel him

1953
01:27:35,370 --> 01:27:36,450
because you're so blasted good

1954
01:27:36,450 --> 01:27:38,430
at feeling sorry for yourself.

1955
01:27:38,430 --> 01:27:40,230
Your father never left you,

1956
01:27:40,230 --> 01:27:42,510
he is part you, lad, always will be.

1957
01:27:42,510 --> 01:27:43,893
So don't despair, partner.

1958
01:27:46,470 --> 01:27:47,741
- Well, she does it to me too.

1959
01:27:47,741 --> 01:27:48,706
- Oh, "She does this.

1960
01:27:48,706 --> 01:27:49,539
I do that.

1961
01:27:49,539 --> 01:27:50,487
She does this."

1962
01:27:53,130 --> 01:27:55,230
Stop avoiding the problem.

1963
01:27:55,230 --> 01:27:56,530
What are you so afraid of.

1964
01:27:58,570 --> 01:28:00,030
(somber music)

1965
01:28:00,030 --> 01:28:01,735
- Losing her.

1966
01:28:01,735 --> 01:28:05,850
- Oh, well, that's a horse
of a different color now,

1967
01:28:05,850 --> 01:28:06,683
isn't it?

1968
01:28:07,620 --> 01:28:09,944
Perhaps you should be telling her this.

1969
01:28:09,944 --> 01:28:13,361
(somber music continues)

1970
01:28:16,738 --> 01:28:19,671
(Billy sighs)

1971
01:28:19,671 --> 01:28:22,254
(gentle music)

1972
01:28:26,610 --> 01:28:28,350
- Well, come on, Yarik.

1973
01:28:28,350 --> 01:28:31,200
This could be your ticket out
of here. Let's go talk to Mom.

1974
01:28:31,200 --> 01:28:32,840
- You don't need me, lad.

1975
01:28:32,840 --> 01:28:34,440
I have nothing left to teach you.

1976
01:28:34,440 --> 01:28:36,390
You're no longer a squire.

1977
01:28:36,390 --> 01:28:39,564
It's your turn to accept
the mantle of knighthood.

1978
01:28:39,564 --> 01:28:42,147
(gentle music)

1979
01:28:47,054 --> 01:28:50,471
(door squeaks and bangs)

1980
01:28:59,673 --> 01:29:01,680
(door slams)

1981
01:29:01,680 --> 01:29:02,786
- Where have you been?

1982
01:29:02,786 --> 01:29:05,369
(somber music)

1983
01:29:09,570 --> 01:29:11,722
God, Billy, look at you.

1984
01:29:11,722 --> 01:29:12,889
What happened?

1985
01:29:14,367 --> 01:29:16,200
- It's okay, Mom.

1986
01:29:16,200 --> 01:29:18,150
- What is this supposed to mean?

1987
01:29:18,150 --> 01:29:19,350
- It's, it's okay, Mom.

1988
01:29:19,350 --> 01:29:20,790
I, I'm okay.

1989
01:29:20,790 --> 01:29:21,720
- Where have you been?

1990
01:29:21,720 --> 01:29:22,890
Don't lie to me!

1991
01:29:22,890 --> 01:29:24,063
How could you do that?

1992
01:29:25,741 --> 01:29:27,690
- I'm not in a gang, Mom.

1993
01:29:27,690 --> 01:29:29,390
They wanted me to, but I said, no.

1994
01:29:33,180 --> 01:29:34,597
I promise.

1995
01:29:34,597 --> 01:29:37,180
(somber music)

1996
01:29:43,954 --> 01:29:48,708
- I saw on the news,
the jacket, (sniffles)

1997
01:29:48,708 --> 01:29:50,041
I got so afraid.

1998
01:29:52,199 --> 01:29:54,782
- But you never worried before.

1999
01:29:57,835 --> 01:30:01,173
- Billy, I worry about you all the time.

2000
01:30:03,943 --> 01:30:05,583
I just didn't like to show it.

2001
01:30:06,617 --> 01:30:10,034
(somber music continues)

2002
01:30:18,476 --> 01:30:19,783
(mom sighs)

2003
01:30:19,783 --> 01:30:22,950
When your father died, (sniffles)

2004
01:30:22,950 --> 01:30:24,393
I felt so abandoned.

2005
01:30:26,915 --> 01:30:29,043
- Yeah, me too.

2006
01:30:30,960 --> 01:30:34,320
- And you were becoming
the spitting image of him:

2007
01:30:34,320 --> 01:30:36,123
your laugh, your temper.

2008
01:30:37,552 --> 01:30:40,980
I just, I couldn't lose everything again.

2009
01:30:40,980 --> 01:30:42,786
I couldn't do it again.

2010
01:30:42,786 --> 01:30:46,203
(somber music continues)

2011
01:30:47,100 --> 01:30:49,381
Maybe I shut you out.

2012
01:30:49,381 --> 01:30:51,000
And the more I pulled away from you,

2013
01:30:51,000 --> 01:30:52,743
the more like him you became.

2014
01:30:54,438 --> 01:30:57,855
(somber music continues)

2015
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:00,319
- It's okay.

2016
01:31:02,772 --> 01:31:03,605
It's okay.

2017
01:31:05,669 --> 01:31:08,887
(mom sobbing)

2018
01:31:08,887 --> 01:31:09,720
- Tonight,

2019
01:31:10,650 --> 01:31:13,740
tonight I prayed with all my
heart and with all my soul

2020
01:31:13,740 --> 01:31:15,690
that if you would just in that door,

2021
01:31:15,690 --> 01:31:17,008
I would crawl through hell

2022
01:31:17,008 --> 01:31:20,493
to make sure you knew how
much I loved you. (sighs)

2023
01:31:23,220 --> 01:31:24,876
- I miss you so much.

2024
01:31:24,876 --> 01:31:28,293
(somber music continues)

2025
01:31:42,000 --> 01:31:47,000
- I'm sorry, sweetie.

2026
01:31:47,127 --> 01:31:49,170
You know, your father just got mixed up

2027
01:31:49,170 --> 01:31:50,463
with the wrong people.

2028
01:31:51,990 --> 01:31:54,347
He loved you and he loved me,

2029
01:31:58,170 --> 01:32:00,820
and he would never want
anything bad to happen to us.

2030
01:32:02,488 --> 01:32:04,738
- He doesn't have to worry.

2031
01:32:06,415 --> 01:32:08,998
(mom sniffles)

2032
01:32:10,454 --> 01:32:12,121
- I love you, Billy.

2033
01:32:13,680 --> 01:32:15,097
- I love you too.

2034
01:32:19,642 --> 01:32:20,475
(gentle music)

2035
01:32:20,475 --> 01:32:23,132
(mom sniffles)

2036
01:32:23,132 --> 01:32:26,549
(gentle music continues)

2037
01:32:30,091 --> 01:32:31,674
- Do you hear that?

2038
01:32:32,508 --> 01:32:34,154
- What?

2039
01:32:34,154 --> 01:32:36,452
(gentle music continues)

2040
01:32:36,452 --> 01:32:37,995
- Over here.

2041
01:32:37,995 --> 01:32:41,412
(gentle music continues)

2042
01:33:14,411 --> 01:33:17,828
(gentle music continues)

2043
01:33:55,298 --> 01:33:57,881
- [Mom] It's a beautiful night.

2044
01:34:00,870 --> 01:34:02,320
- Yeah, it is.

2045
01:34:02,320 --> 01:34:05,737
(gentle music continues)

2046
01:34:12,900 --> 01:34:14,127
Hi, Mr. Fallon.

2047
01:34:14,127 --> 01:34:17,703
- Ooh, welcome back, Billy. (chuckles)

2048
01:34:20,460 --> 01:34:21,810
- I came to return this.

2049
01:34:21,810 --> 01:34:23,043
- So soon?

2050
01:34:24,570 --> 01:34:26,007
- Thanks for everything, Mr. Fallon.

2051
01:34:26,007 --> 01:34:27,210
- Why? In fact, what did I do?

2052
01:34:27,210 --> 01:34:28,893
What are you thanking me for?

2053
01:34:30,090 --> 01:34:31,080
- You were right.

2054
01:34:31,080 --> 01:34:32,130
- I was right?

2055
01:34:32,130 --> 01:34:33,900
That happens so rarely.

2056
01:34:33,900 --> 01:34:34,890
Refresh my memory.

2057
01:34:34,890 --> 01:34:36,540
What did I say?

2058
01:34:36,540 --> 01:34:38,880
- You said problems
are meant to be solved.

2059
01:34:38,880 --> 01:34:40,980
- Oh, that's wonderful.

2060
01:34:40,980 --> 01:34:42,960
That's absolutely wonderful.

2061
01:34:42,960 --> 01:34:46,320
You know, I realize that
you have a great feeling

2062
01:34:46,320 --> 01:34:48,660
for these beautiful old toys.

2063
01:34:48,660 --> 01:34:52,050
How would you like to
work here as my helper,

2064
01:34:52,050 --> 01:34:53,553
earn a little money?

2065
01:34:55,230 --> 01:34:56,100
- When can I start?

2066
01:34:56,100 --> 01:34:57,030
- Come by Monday.

2067
01:34:57,030 --> 01:34:58,590
We'll talk about it.

2068
01:34:58,590 --> 01:35:00,332
I'll just put him away.

2069
01:35:00,332 --> 01:35:01,165
I'll put him right-

2070
01:35:01,165 --> 01:35:02,730
- You know, you might wanna put him with-

2071
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:04,410
- Oh, you know where he should go.

2072
01:35:04,410 --> 01:35:06,340
So put him, you put him

2073
01:35:10,380 --> 01:35:11,550
Perfect.

2074
01:35:11,550 --> 01:35:13,380
Right next to Katrina,

2075
01:35:13,380 --> 01:35:15,123
exactly where he wants to be.

2076
01:35:16,800 --> 01:35:17,850
- Yeah, you're right.

2077
01:35:18,720 --> 01:35:21,360
He has his lady, and I have mine.

2078
01:35:21,360 --> 01:35:22,193
- Oh my.

2079
01:35:23,073 --> 01:35:25,612
Isn't that something?

2080
01:35:25,612 --> 01:35:28,195
(gentle music)

2081
01:36:08,930 --> 01:36:11,513
(gentle music)

2082
01:36:37,785 --> 01:36:41,202
(gentle music continues)

2083
01:36:51,788 --> 01:36:54,371
(gentle music)

2084
01:37:27,956 --> 01:37:31,373
(gentle music continues)

2085
01:37:56,582 --> 01:37:59,999
(gentle music continues)

2086
01:38:27,168 --> 01:38:30,585
(gentle music continues)

2087
01:38:53,821 --> 01:38:57,238
(gentle music continues)
