1
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,797
Prime Minister Musayev,

2
00:05:52,369 --> 00:05:54,132
if you don't recognize me,

3
00:05:54,504 --> 00:05:57,132
Iook hard at my face and you'll understand.

4
00:05:58,308 --> 00:06:01,835
General Vasilly Topov
was not only my father,

5
00:06:02,512 --> 00:06:04,809
he was my comrade, my leader in battle.

6
00:06:05,047 --> 00:06:06,948
And now his fight
for the liberation of Pasalan

7
00:06:07,117 --> 00:06:08,345
is my own.

8
00:06:11,087 --> 00:06:12,555
His army is under my command,

9
00:06:12,856 --> 00:06:14,414
and I will stop at nothing

10
00:06:14,524 --> 00:06:15,990
to make his dreams become reality.

11
00:06:23,699 --> 00:06:24,792
Prime Minister Musayev,

12
00:06:24,901 --> 00:06:28,961
we have occupied
the Chernobyl nuclear power plant.

13
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:36,001
The abandoned city surrounding
the complex is under our control.

14
00:06:39,348 --> 00:06:41,145
No longer can we be ignored.

15
00:06:41,250 --> 00:06:43,013
Now, we are the occupiers.

16
00:06:46,689 --> 00:06:48,657
Any attempt to penetrate its borders

17
00:06:48,758 --> 00:06:50,885
will be met with fierce resistance.

18
00:06:53,396 --> 00:06:55,922
The reactor
has been rigged with explosives.

19
00:06:56,033 --> 00:06:58,626
Detonators have been set to 72 hours.

20
00:06:58,734 --> 00:07:00,725
Should our demands go unanswered,
they will go off.

21
00:07:01,370 --> 00:07:04,464
Such an explosion
would produce a radiation cloud

22
00:07:04,573 --> 00:07:06,666
100 times stronger
than the bombs dropped on Japan.

23
00:07:11,180 --> 00:07:12,841
We call for the imminent release of all

24
00:07:12,948 --> 00:07:15,940
227 political prisoners you've held captive.

25
00:07:17,753 --> 00:07:20,414
We call for the complete
and total independence of Pasalan.

26
00:07:21,957 --> 00:07:24,585
Nothing less will be deemed acceptable.

27
00:07:25,760 --> 00:07:28,696
Prime Minister Musayev, this fight
is not only about country and politics,

28
00:07:28,964 --> 00:07:31,090
it is about blood.

29
00:07:31,266 --> 00:07:32,233
Mine...

30
00:07:32,333 --> 00:07:33,300
...and now yours.

31
00:07:34,270 --> 00:07:36,067
We have your children.

32
00:07:36,505 --> 00:07:38,267
Should you ignore my demands

33
00:07:38,440 --> 00:07:40,238
they will be the first to go.

34
00:07:42,377 --> 00:07:44,743
I urge you to act responsibly.

35
00:07:46,816 --> 00:07:48,305
We ask only to be free,

36
00:07:49,417 --> 00:07:51,817
as you would want your children to be free.

37
00:08:02,397 --> 00:08:04,388
Come on, come on, come on.

38
00:08:06,034 --> 00:08:08,366
That's it. Hey, take it easy.

39
00:08:12,173 --> 00:08:13,401
This way.

40
00:08:16,344 --> 00:08:18,209
Okay, come on, come on.

41
00:08:18,613 --> 00:08:23,015
Over there, right over there.
All right, now take it easy. Take it easy.

42
00:08:24,285 --> 00:08:27,982
Hey, easy! For Christ's sake,
there's spare parts in there!

43
00:08:28,989 --> 00:08:30,150
Morons.

44
00:09:03,290 --> 00:09:04,348
Sit.

45
00:09:19,106 --> 00:09:21,506
-How do you feel?
-I feel good.

46
00:09:23,277 --> 00:09:25,074
-Any problems?
-No.

47
00:09:28,916 --> 00:09:31,248
-Do you know where you are?
-Yes.

48
00:09:32,485 --> 00:09:35,148
-Do you know why you're here?
-Yes.

49
00:09:36,356 --> 00:09:39,917
Is it necessary for you to question
the things you don't know?

50
00:09:40,027 --> 00:09:41,995
-No.
-Excuse me, Doctor.

51
00:09:42,329 --> 00:09:43,625
Thank you.

52
00:09:43,763 --> 00:09:46,096
Okay, can you please move
your right fingers,

53
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,997
one by one, beginning with the forefinger?

54
00:09:50,169 --> 00:09:52,730
-Limited range.
-All right.

55
00:09:53,140 --> 00:09:54,198
Okay.

56
00:09:55,942 --> 00:09:58,605
-Do you feel warm?
-Yes.

57
00:10:00,314 --> 00:10:02,178
I'm gonna cool you off.

58
00:10:18,998 --> 00:10:22,263
Very good. You were very good today.

59
00:10:54,165 --> 00:10:57,294
So you've seen the security tape
from the museum?

60
00:10:57,403 --> 00:10:58,562
I have.

61
00:10:59,271 --> 00:11:02,241
You want to describe what you saw,
or shall l?

62
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:06,133
I saw an armed assailant take
direct hits to vital areas

63
00:11:06,645 --> 00:11:09,705
and still manage
to overpower a security detail.

64
00:11:10,415 --> 00:11:12,576
This remind you of something?

65
00:11:13,419 --> 00:11:16,216
White Tower was shut down over a year ago.

66
00:11:16,755 --> 00:11:19,246
-Maybe it was something else.
-Maybe.

67
00:11:19,525 --> 00:11:23,984
But we should still prepare for the worst,
however remote the possibility.

68
00:11:25,230 --> 00:11:29,030
So, if we assume the worst,
the problem becomes ours to share.

69
00:11:29,167 --> 00:11:30,657
Hypothetically.

70
00:11:31,102 --> 00:11:33,832
So then, hypothetically,

71
00:11:34,539 --> 00:11:36,632
what is our shared solution?

72
00:12:26,757 --> 00:12:28,453
Let's load them up.

73
00:12:40,838 --> 00:12:45,207
On April 26th, 1986,
Chernobyl Reactor Number 4 exploded.

74
00:12:45,809 --> 00:12:48,778
Worst nuclear power plant accident
in history.

75
00:12:49,580 --> 00:12:51,377
The ensuing fire released a plume

76
00:12:51,482 --> 00:12:54,645
of highly radioactive fallout
into the atmosphere.

77
00:12:55,519 --> 00:12:57,419
The city of Chernobyl was evacuated

78
00:12:57,521 --> 00:13:00,422
and has remained abandoned
for over 20 years.

79
00:13:01,825 --> 00:13:04,055
We believe the rebels have set up
their bunker

80
00:13:04,161 --> 00:13:06,959
in one of the buildings adjacent
to the reactor complex,

81
00:13:07,097 --> 00:13:11,294
about two miles due east
from our current position in Chernobyl city.

82
00:13:14,171 --> 00:13:17,628
While the site itself
no longer has enough fuel to make a bomb,

83
00:13:17,740 --> 00:13:20,039
it has 100 times the radiation.

84
00:13:21,412 --> 00:13:25,439
An explosion in Reactor Number 3
would release that radiation.

85
00:13:26,917 --> 00:13:28,816
And now for the bad news.

86
00:13:28,918 --> 00:13:32,514
It appears the general's son has gotten
his hands on some of our weaponry.

87
00:13:33,689 --> 00:13:36,180
Here to explain, Dr. Richard Porter.

88
00:13:42,465 --> 00:13:45,127
In the 1960s, with war in Asia looming,

89
00:13:46,035 --> 00:13:49,266
the U.S. began research
into Operation Black Tower,

90
00:13:50,474 --> 00:13:53,306
what we've now come to call
the Universal Soldier program.

91
00:13:54,777 --> 00:13:59,646
A high-response, self-sustaining,
quick-healing, stronger, faster soldier,

92
00:13:59,749 --> 00:14:02,741
fueled by high-concentrate
nutritional supplements.

93
00:14:02,852 --> 00:14:06,652
A soldier that operates
without conscience or hesitation.

94
00:14:07,790 --> 00:14:10,588
By freezing a human body
with nitrogen-based gas,

95
00:14:10,693 --> 00:14:15,096
repairing it and reheating it
through thyroid and pituitary augmentation,

96
00:14:15,498 --> 00:14:18,729
we were able to revive
a recently-deceased soldier,

97
00:14:19,268 --> 00:14:21,634
and, in the process, improve them.

98
00:14:22,205 --> 00:14:24,537
Programmable and erasable.

99
00:14:25,941 --> 00:14:28,570
One that you can turn on and turn off.

100
00:14:29,645 --> 00:14:31,544
Deceased, as in dead?

101
00:14:33,548 --> 00:14:37,575
That's right.
Five years ago, the program was suspended,

102
00:14:37,686 --> 00:14:41,623
or, rather, replaced by a program
known as White Tower.

103
00:14:42,757 --> 00:14:45,885
Led by Dr. Robert Colin,
under my supervision,

104
00:14:45,994 --> 00:14:50,590
White Tower sought to improve and perfect
what Black Tower had introduced.

105
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:56,628
Using gene therapy techniques developed
during Dr. Colin's cloning research,

106
00:14:56,738 --> 00:15:01,698
we were able to give our UniSols
a DNA tune-up from the inside out.

107
00:15:02,010 --> 00:15:05,412
The new model was superior
in every physical capacity,

108
00:15:06,515 --> 00:15:08,506
a virtual killing machine.

109
00:15:09,684 --> 00:15:11,914
The next generation UniSols,

110
00:15:12,654 --> 00:15:15,020
or NGUs, as we like to call them.

111
00:15:16,558 --> 00:15:20,085
There was, however,
an incident in a government building.

112
00:15:21,897 --> 00:15:24,957
Twelve dead. Nobody injured.

113
00:15:26,168 --> 00:15:28,534
It was considered to be a malfunction,

114
00:15:28,637 --> 00:15:32,698
though I believe their temperature
had not been properly moderated.

115
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:36,834
We were instructed to shut down
all the existing NGUs, which we did.

116
00:15:37,112 --> 00:15:39,103
But there was a break-in.

117
00:15:39,781 --> 00:15:43,717
Some things were taken,
including a Series 7 model.

118
00:15:44,519 --> 00:15:48,454
We have reason to believe
it was my former colleague, Dr. Colin.

119
00:15:48,589 --> 00:15:51,457
We suspect
he's been continuing his studies.

120
00:15:52,493 --> 00:15:56,362
Colin's been operating
out of Eastern Europe as a gun-for-hire.

121
00:15:56,865 --> 00:16:00,630
Gentlemen, we'll be fighting
against the perfect soldier.

122
00:16:01,502 --> 00:16:04,835
One who is impervious to injury and pain,
quicker than hell,

123
00:16:04,939 --> 00:16:08,103
and with a nervous system
unaffected by radiation.

124
00:16:09,044 --> 00:16:12,012
We have four first-generation UniSols

125
00:16:12,112 --> 00:16:15,343
that are more than capable
in this type of endgame.

126
00:16:16,317 --> 00:16:17,614
Dismissed.

127
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:24,582
-You say four, Colonel.
-That's correct.

128
00:16:24,692 --> 00:16:28,219
-I thought there was five.
-There were. Now there's four.

129
00:16:28,329 --> 00:16:29,887
What happened to the fifth?

130
00:16:29,997 --> 00:16:34,058
He's the subject of a privately-funded
program run by Dr. Sandra Fleming.

131
00:16:34,168 --> 00:16:36,363
-Project Phoenix.
-Doing what?

132
00:16:37,404 --> 00:16:39,702
Behavioral modification therapy

133
00:16:39,840 --> 00:16:43,173
or psychological rehabilitation,
as Dr. Fleming calls it.

134
00:16:45,245 --> 00:16:48,215
She's trying to reintroduce him into society.

135
00:16:49,649 --> 00:16:53,518
He was one of the very first,
but by far the best of the group.

136
00:16:55,122 --> 00:16:58,888
Dr. Fleming has been conducting
her research in Switzerland.

137
00:17:01,594 --> 00:17:03,221
I think of escape.

138
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,391
Peaceful feeling.

139
00:17:13,473 --> 00:17:15,873
-Shame.
-Why do you say that?

140
00:17:18,244 --> 00:17:20,235
-I don't know.
-Yes, you do.

141
00:17:20,780 --> 00:17:23,511
Just say the first thing
that comes into your mind.

142
00:17:23,617 --> 00:17:25,208
I don't remember.

143
00:17:29,523 --> 00:17:31,717
Maybe for things I have done.

144
00:17:34,560 --> 00:17:36,494
What have you done, Luc?

145
00:17:41,100 --> 00:17:42,533
I don't know.

146
00:17:48,006 --> 00:17:49,736
I think he's hungry.

147
00:17:51,944 --> 00:17:53,808
Why don't you feed him?

148
00:18:10,462 --> 00:18:12,020
How do you feel?

149
00:18:13,666 --> 00:18:14,928
Helpless.

150
00:18:16,702 --> 00:18:19,866
Maybe you're feeling
the weight of responsibility.

151
00:18:20,340 --> 00:18:23,206
It's what it feels like to grow older, Luc.

152
00:18:24,509 --> 00:18:26,978
Do you realize how far you've come?

153
00:18:27,779 --> 00:18:30,577
Two years ago when we started this,
when you first woke up,

154
00:18:30,682 --> 00:18:33,242
you couldn't remember the day before.

155
00:18:36,588 --> 00:18:40,615
-My head feels full.
-It's just another stage in your development.

156
00:18:43,161 --> 00:18:44,890
We're getting there.

157
00:19:03,414 --> 00:19:07,078
You may have forgotten our agreement,
Doctor, but I haven't.

158
00:19:07,185 --> 00:19:09,345
Consider this my last reminder.

159
00:19:09,453 --> 00:19:14,186
I haven't forgotten, I've been in surgery,
which appears to be quite a success.

160
00:19:14,892 --> 00:19:18,727
-So, when will we do it?
-I told you, I'm gonna run a diagnostic...

161
00:19:18,830 --> 00:19:22,527
I have to guarantee the safety of my men,
as well as my own.

162
00:19:24,836 --> 00:19:26,700
It'll be taken care of.

163
00:19:27,638 --> 00:19:32,075
So you want to wait? Then I guess
the wire transfers can wait as well.

164
00:19:33,110 --> 00:19:35,079
What's the hurry, right?

165
00:19:36,014 --> 00:19:37,810
-Miles.
-Yes, Doctor?

166
00:19:38,249 --> 00:19:40,979
The general's son is growing anxious.

167
00:19:41,353 --> 00:19:45,413
He'd like to be micro-chipped this instant.
It can't possibly wait.

168
00:19:46,857 --> 00:19:50,588
I'm nobody's son anymore, Doctor.
It is Commander Topov.

169
00:19:52,563 --> 00:19:53,688
Right.

170
00:19:58,636 --> 00:20:01,264
I've done it to myself.
It does hurt a little bit now.

171
00:20:01,372 --> 00:20:02,839
Maybe for you.

172
00:20:06,844 --> 00:20:09,335
-Failsafe is active, sir.
-Satisfied?

173
00:20:10,848 --> 00:20:12,178
No. My men.

174
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:16,709
Fine. Round them up.

175
00:21:41,170 --> 00:21:43,160
Gentlemen, two-pronged objective.

176
00:21:43,272 --> 00:21:46,639
Securing of the reactor site
and the dismantling of the detonators,

177
00:21:46,743 --> 00:21:49,006
and the extraction
of the two known hostages.

178
00:21:49,177 --> 00:21:52,442
Now, we have reason to believe
that the children are being held here.

179
00:21:52,548 --> 00:21:54,107
However, their positions could be fluid,

180
00:21:54,217 --> 00:21:57,413
so we're moving in
on a staggered six-front maneuver.

181
00:21:57,519 --> 00:21:59,886
Disable all communication
and transportation vehicles

182
00:21:59,989 --> 00:22:02,923
that you encounter,
and remember the objective.

183
00:22:03,025 --> 00:22:07,428
If it comes down to either-or,
we go big picture and we take the reactor.

184
00:22:07,829 --> 00:22:11,424
-Are there any questions?
-What if we encounter the freak?

185
00:22:11,633 --> 00:22:13,464
Avoidance, if you can.

186
00:22:15,370 --> 00:22:18,862
-Keep it occupied.
-ls that the best you can do, Doctor?

187
00:22:19,875 --> 00:22:23,140
It's probably programmed
to defend the reactor site,

188
00:22:23,444 --> 00:22:25,913
so it'll stick close to it like a nest,

189
00:22:26,014 --> 00:22:31,008
making it impossible to use high-powered
weaponry in the presence of the explosives.

190
00:22:31,453 --> 00:22:34,944
Captain, your men should not engage
with the NGU.

191
00:22:36,190 --> 00:22:38,182
That's what my men are for.

192
00:22:55,944 --> 00:22:58,741
-It's hot in here.
-Take your coat off.

193
00:23:04,518 --> 00:23:07,248
-We've been here before?
-Every week.

194
00:23:08,590 --> 00:23:10,420
That's what I thought.

195
00:23:11,025 --> 00:23:14,985
-Can I get you guys some coffee?
-Yeah, sure, I'll have some coffee, thanks.

196
00:23:15,097 --> 00:23:18,793
-What would you like, Luc, to drink?
-Orange juice.

197
00:23:19,333 --> 00:23:22,359
Great. I'll be right back to take your orders.

198
00:23:25,740 --> 00:23:28,709
-How are your knees feeling?
-A little better.

199
00:23:29,410 --> 00:23:33,608
I think the anti-inflammatories are working.
We need to get you some more of those.

200
00:23:33,714 --> 00:23:36,979
The weather report said
there may be another snow front on the way.

201
00:23:37,084 --> 00:23:39,381
Could get a couple of inches
over the weekend.

202
00:23:39,486 --> 00:23:42,888
I think the cold weather's
been affecting your joints.

203
00:23:44,090 --> 00:23:47,254
The next shipment should be in
by next week, so...

204
00:23:59,140 --> 00:24:00,164
Luc!

205
00:24:02,175 --> 00:24:05,339
Luc, stop! Luc! No!

206
00:24:07,113 --> 00:24:08,876
Luc, stop! Luc!

207
00:24:10,583 --> 00:24:13,575
Luc, stop! Stop!

208
00:24:14,954 --> 00:24:16,649
No! Luc, no!

209
00:24:18,159 --> 00:24:19,921
No! Luc, stop, stop!

210
00:24:21,061 --> 00:24:22,494
Luc, stop!

211
00:24:25,131 --> 00:24:27,691
-Somebody help him.
-Go! Go! Go!

212
00:25:13,412 --> 00:25:15,540
-Man down! We got a man down.
-Move, move, move!

213
00:25:33,032 --> 00:25:36,762
-Let's go! Move, move, move! Go!
-Come on, come on!

214
00:25:50,349 --> 00:25:54,217
Hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceed to reactor complex.

215
00:25:54,920 --> 00:25:59,653
Repeat, hold fire, holding fire.
All units proceeding to reactor complex.

216
00:26:00,259 --> 00:26:03,922
Copy that. Unit One holding fire.
All units holding fire.

217
00:26:04,029 --> 00:26:06,429
-All systems green, sir.
-Good.

218
00:26:09,801 --> 00:26:13,499
The complex in sight.
All units falling into position, over.

219
00:26:17,643 --> 00:26:22,045
Unit One, Unit Two, two units,
report to the south perimeter. Cover your...

220
00:26:22,146 --> 00:26:24,411
Unit One holding. Contact back.

221
00:26:26,317 --> 00:26:28,285
I'll take the north side.

222
00:26:30,155 --> 00:26:32,520
Unit Two is on the move.
Proceeding to north perimeter.

223
00:26:32,623 --> 00:26:34,716
Unit Two to north perimeter.

224
00:26:36,861 --> 00:26:39,694
Unit Two, hold position in north perimeter.

225
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,097
We're on the south perimeter, Structure 3.
We're going in. Over.

226
00:26:46,204 --> 00:26:48,638
Burke, the show's on.
Send them in and provide cover.

227
00:26:48,739 --> 00:26:51,173
Sir, we have successfully taken out
all lines of defense.

228
00:26:51,275 --> 00:26:52,833
We need to send in two units.

229
00:26:52,944 --> 00:26:57,074
Negative. Send in the freaks.
That's an order, Burke. Pull back.

230
00:26:57,782 --> 00:26:59,113
Roger that.

231
00:27:00,418 --> 00:27:02,181
It's all yours, boys.

232
00:27:05,889 --> 00:27:07,482
Don't fuck it up.

233
00:27:44,762 --> 00:27:47,229
How long before they reach
the Meeting Point A?

234
00:27:47,330 --> 00:27:48,797
Stand by, sir.

235
00:28:28,103 --> 00:28:29,162
There he is. There he is.

236
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,263
-Shut him down.
-I'm on it.

237
00:29:00,337 --> 00:29:02,702
Holy shit, did you see that?
Did you see that?

238
00:29:04,273 --> 00:29:06,504
One is out. Tell Two and Three
One is down.

239
00:29:06,608 --> 00:29:09,702
We need Two, Three and Four to triangulate
on the new position. Do it!

240
00:29:40,943 --> 00:29:42,068
We're gonna triangulate... Come on!

241
00:29:42,176 --> 00:29:43,872
We're gonna triangulate on what's...
Hang on!

242
00:29:43,979 --> 00:29:45,241
Triangulate... Listen to me.

243
00:30:01,562 --> 00:30:03,463
Let him go! Let him go!
Move Four to the reactor.

244
00:30:03,565 --> 00:30:05,691
Have Three engage. Have Three engage.

245
00:31:01,489 --> 00:31:04,514
-What the hell is going on?
-He's too fast. They can't track him.

246
00:31:14,768 --> 00:31:16,861
All right, let's get Four to the reactor.
Get Four.

247
00:31:16,970 --> 00:31:19,063
Four moving to the reactor, sir.
Four moving.

248
00:31:40,193 --> 00:31:43,321
-Sir, approaching the reactor right now.
-Okay, there they are. There they are.

249
00:31:43,430 --> 00:31:46,957
-Shut them down, Doctor.
-Deactivate. Repeat, deactivate.

250
00:34:33,064 --> 00:34:36,294
Complete evac. Send the order.
Burke, complete evac. Pull them out!

251
00:34:36,400 --> 00:34:37,492
-Evac. Evac.
-Pull back now!

252
00:34:37,601 --> 00:34:39,502
-Get everybody out of there!
-Complete evac now. Complete evac.

253
00:34:39,604 --> 00:34:40,661
Colonel.

254
00:34:40,771 --> 00:34:43,399
Tell them to retreat. Get them out.
Get the men out of there.

255
00:34:43,507 --> 00:34:46,272
-Retreat. I repeat, retreat...
-Get them all out. Tell him that is an order...

256
00:34:46,376 --> 00:34:48,742
-You're not coming in clear.
-Sir.

257
00:35:21,043 --> 00:35:24,309
We're under fire. Unit One under fire.
Falling back.

258
00:35:53,242 --> 00:35:54,301
Shit.

259
00:35:54,811 --> 00:35:58,268
Colonel Petrov's down.
Request transportation.

260
00:35:58,547 --> 00:35:59,707
No, no.

261
00:36:00,550 --> 00:36:02,176
Request transport.

262
00:36:02,418 --> 00:36:03,442
Go. Go.

263
00:36:03,552 --> 00:36:06,681
Listen to me, God damn it.
You're coming with me.

264
00:36:12,395 --> 00:36:16,126
Go now. Take him with you. Go.

265
00:36:21,670 --> 00:36:24,138
Take him with you! Go!

266
00:36:27,643 --> 00:36:30,042
Look. Is he coming?

267
00:37:24,999 --> 00:37:28,366
-How's my boy?
-I feel good.

268
00:37:29,137 --> 00:37:33,096
Good. That's very good.
That's my good boy.

269
00:37:33,841 --> 00:37:34,866
Yes.

270
00:37:36,778 --> 00:37:38,143
Magnificent.

271
00:38:05,807 --> 00:38:07,138
That's because
we're gonna give you a chance

272
00:38:07,242 --> 00:38:09,004
to explain the situation when they get here.

273
00:38:09,109 --> 00:38:11,043
-I told you from the start...
-We were sitting ducks out there.

274
00:38:11,144 --> 00:38:13,306
You don't need to tell me.
I saw it with my own eyes.

275
00:38:13,414 --> 00:38:15,278
If you let us in,
we would've taken him out ourselves.

276
00:38:15,382 --> 00:38:17,407
You didn't stand a chance. You never did.

277
00:38:17,518 --> 00:38:21,852
-Hey, hey, come on. Knock it off. Get back.
-You don't have to like it, but it's the truth.

278
00:38:21,955 --> 00:38:24,754
It took on your entire outfit
and forced you to retreat.

279
00:38:24,859 --> 00:38:28,191
One man.
We're talking about a perfect specimen.

280
00:38:28,295 --> 00:38:31,321
One who knows nothing other
than to obey an order.

281
00:38:31,431 --> 00:38:33,296
Something you seem
to know nothing about.

282
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:36,369
-Fucking knock your teeth out!
-Hey, hey, hey! Get back!

283
00:38:45,913 --> 00:38:47,778
What the hell was that?

284
00:38:49,181 --> 00:38:53,209
"This imprudent act of aggression
has resulted in a swift response.

285
00:38:53,687 --> 00:38:57,680
"We have detonated one of the explosives
around the reactor.

286
00:38:58,292 --> 00:39:00,350
"Consider it a warning shot.

287
00:39:01,594 --> 00:39:04,826
"The world doesn't appear to apply pressure
to the Bosorow bullies.

288
00:39:04,932 --> 00:39:06,728
"They're allowing them to stall.

289
00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:10,060
"You are not doing anything.
Think about your children."

290
00:41:36,013 --> 00:41:38,710
I empathize with your father.

291
00:41:38,883 --> 00:41:40,145
I know how he feels.

292
00:41:41,351 --> 00:41:44,752
You only hope for your family to be safe.

293
00:41:45,190 --> 00:41:48,090
And when they are not you carry it with you

294
00:41:48,192 --> 00:41:49,352
Iike a cancer.

295
00:41:50,961 --> 00:41:53,691
Unlike me, he can change this.

296
00:41:57,836 --> 00:42:02,033
I would rather die
than see my father give in to you.

297
00:42:05,609 --> 00:42:07,634
And so it may be, for all of us.

298
00:42:08,746 --> 00:42:13,376
Hey. Stockholm syndrome, huh?
Bonding with the captives.

299
00:42:14,084 --> 00:42:15,607
You know, I'm touched.

300
00:42:15,718 --> 00:42:19,678
What's the matter with you, Doctor?
Did the kids pick on you in school?

301
00:42:19,790 --> 00:42:24,489
Yes, yes, they did.
I was asthmatic, bad athlete, terrible skin.

302
00:42:24,595 --> 00:42:27,586
-Don't be so hard on yourself.
-No, no, it's true.

303
00:42:27,697 --> 00:42:29,188
Perhaps I overcompensated.

304
00:42:29,299 --> 00:42:31,290
Yes, we all congratulate you
on your science project.

305
00:42:31,401 --> 00:42:34,995
Now, why don't you go back to your room?
You're boring us.

306
00:42:35,906 --> 00:42:39,033
Hey, you know, kids,
this is an important lesson.

307
00:42:39,509 --> 00:42:42,638
You always have to ask yourself
who's in control.

308
00:42:43,647 --> 00:42:49,176
It's not always the one doing the talking.
Sometimes it's the guy in the background.

309
00:42:50,953 --> 00:42:54,117
I mean, okay,
let's be honest with ourselves here.

310
00:42:54,358 --> 00:42:56,188
You call that an army?

311
00:42:56,359 --> 00:42:59,522
Come on, it's a bunch of peasants
with slingshots.

312
00:42:59,695 --> 00:43:02,562
But just one of my men, just one...

313
00:43:03,699 --> 00:43:05,394
That's all it took.

314
00:43:05,635 --> 00:43:09,662
Now I want you to imagine
an army of men like that.

315
00:43:11,641 --> 00:43:13,939
That, children,

316
00:43:15,845 --> 00:43:17,540
that is real power.

317
00:43:20,449 --> 00:43:21,575
Bravo.

318
00:43:24,253 --> 00:43:26,414
-Very captivating.
-Thank you.

319
00:43:29,826 --> 00:43:32,852
Or maybe your poodle
would like to get a word in.

320
00:43:32,962 --> 00:43:35,760
My poodle. Well, he's kind of shy.

321
00:43:35,865 --> 00:43:39,460
-No, please...
-He's not blessed with the gift of the gab.

322
00:43:41,070 --> 00:43:45,166
Then maybe you can shut the fuck up
and do what I'm paying you for.

323
00:43:47,577 --> 00:43:50,740
Hey, you're the boss.

324
00:44:03,326 --> 00:44:05,885
We think that the main detonators
are over here.

325
00:44:05,994 --> 00:44:07,962
Pull back and encompass
the whole compound.

326
00:44:08,063 --> 00:44:09,554
Copy that, sir.

327
00:44:09,999 --> 00:44:10,987
That's the cooling tower.

328
00:44:11,132 --> 00:44:13,692
If we can get in those pipes,
we can access the reactor there.

329
00:44:13,802 --> 00:44:16,862
It's probably been capped off after
the accident, but it can be reopened, sir.

330
00:44:20,041 --> 00:44:21,338
He's here.

331
00:44:39,060 --> 00:44:40,390
Hello, Luc.

332
00:44:43,431 --> 00:44:47,162
I expect you're feeling somewhat fatigued.
That's normal.

333
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:51,433
The sedation should wear off soon enough.

334
00:44:53,208 --> 00:44:54,334
Sandra?

335
00:44:54,442 --> 00:44:57,842
Dr. Fleming is here
and has authorized this examination,

336
00:44:57,945 --> 00:45:03,815
so there should be no cause for alarm.
We're your friends. You're home, Luc.

337
00:45:04,952 --> 00:45:08,184
I have a few questions for you.
Please answer yes or no.

338
00:45:08,289 --> 00:45:11,690
-I want to talk to Sandra.
-Just answer the questions.

339
00:45:12,994 --> 00:45:16,520
Do you see yourself as a person
who is a reliable worker?

340
00:45:18,767 --> 00:45:19,734
Yes.

341
00:45:19,833 --> 00:45:24,236
Do you see yourself as a person
who is original, comes up with new ideas?

342
00:45:24,940 --> 00:45:25,928
No.

343
00:45:26,440 --> 00:45:30,935
-ls relaxed? Handles stress well?
-Yes.

344
00:45:32,012 --> 00:45:34,947
-Starts quarrels with others?
-Sometimes.

345
00:45:36,517 --> 00:45:37,814
Yes or no.

346
00:45:39,186 --> 00:45:40,483
Sometimes.

347
00:45:42,922 --> 00:45:46,791
I'm gonna give you something
that will help with your recovery.

348
00:45:48,928 --> 00:45:51,420
I'm gonna make you feel better, Luc.

349
00:45:53,000 --> 00:45:55,058
Gonna make you whole again.

350
00:46:09,283 --> 00:46:10,614
Where am l?

351
00:46:19,092 --> 00:46:20,423
Where am I?

352
00:46:32,038 --> 00:46:34,836
We started him on a mixture of both
psychotropic drugs and ergogenics.

353
00:46:34,941 --> 00:46:36,431
-His system isn't ready for that.
-Methylphenidate

354
00:46:36,542 --> 00:46:38,237
-and mentenolone...
-Please, listen to me.

355
00:46:38,344 --> 00:46:39,778
His nervous system will break down.

356
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:42,848
You can't reverse years of hormonal therapy
in a day.

357
00:46:42,949 --> 00:46:47,249
It's like rehabilitating a fight dog,
then putting it back to fight.

358
00:46:47,453 --> 00:46:52,413
-This could backfire in a myriad of ways.
-Rehabilitation was never part of his design.

359
00:46:52,525 --> 00:46:54,720
And as you can see,
he's at odds with his nature.

360
00:46:54,827 --> 00:46:57,387
He was created to serve a need,
and he's not doing that.

361
00:46:57,497 --> 00:47:00,466
But now
you're just compounding the situation.

362
00:47:00,566 --> 00:47:04,365
Dr. Fleming, you have to ask yourself
whether a dog, once it has tasted blood,

363
00:47:04,469 --> 00:47:06,404
can ever forget that taste.

364
00:47:06,506 --> 00:47:11,307
There is substantial power inside of him
that I have spent two years regulating.

365
00:47:11,477 --> 00:47:14,412
If you unleash it this quickly,
you may not be able to control it.

366
00:47:14,514 --> 00:47:18,712
Just get him up to speed, Doc.
You let me worry about controlling it.

367
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:24,984
Listen. You said something
about some pipes earlier.

368
00:47:25,091 --> 00:47:26,058
-Yes, sir.
-You still think you can

369
00:47:26,159 --> 00:47:28,023
-get in through there?
-I know I can, sir.

370
00:47:28,126 --> 00:47:30,118
Okay, we're gonna try this your way.
Listen to me.

371
00:47:30,229 --> 00:47:32,594
This is strictly recon.
Do not engage this thing.

372
00:47:32,697 --> 00:47:33,959
It's not combat. You understand?

373
00:47:34,066 --> 00:47:35,693
-Yes, sir.
-Okay, let's go.

374
00:51:27,129 --> 00:51:28,858
Why is she in there?

375
00:51:29,331 --> 00:51:32,994
Unfortunately, at the moment,
she's the only one he trusts.

376
00:51:36,872 --> 00:51:40,773
You know, in business, as in life,
people are so distrustful.

377
00:51:40,942 --> 00:51:43,206
-They always want insurance.
-Yes, sir.

378
00:51:43,312 --> 00:51:46,940
I mean, whatever happened
to the handshake deal? Am I right?

379
00:51:47,048 --> 00:51:50,780
-You're right, sir.
-Failsafe. Everybody wants a failsafe.

380
00:51:51,619 --> 00:51:55,249
-But where is my failsafe? You understand?
-Yes, Doctor.

381
00:51:55,924 --> 00:51:59,120
No, no, I'm asking you. Where's my failsafe?

382
00:52:03,364 --> 00:52:06,630
-This is your failsafe.
-And why is that?

383
00:52:09,470 --> 00:52:12,463
Because the NGU cannot hurt
the commander and his men.

384
00:52:12,574 --> 00:52:13,700
Right.

385
00:52:13,875 --> 00:52:16,775
But... But he can.

386
00:52:17,278 --> 00:52:18,746
Indeed he can.

387
00:52:19,214 --> 00:52:21,272
-Very smart, Doctor.
-Of course it is.

388
00:52:21,382 --> 00:52:24,613
You see, Miles,
there's always a way around things.

389
00:52:24,752 --> 00:52:28,882
Now, I want you to count his fingers
and toes. No, I'm just kidding.

390
00:52:29,857 --> 00:52:32,655
We've come a long way from replicating
sheep, wouldn't you say, Miles?

391
00:52:32,760 --> 00:52:33,988
Yes, sir.

392
00:52:37,932 --> 00:52:39,797
Happy birthday, my boy.

393
00:53:30,316 --> 00:53:32,910
Colonel, I can disconnect this thing.

394
00:53:33,921 --> 00:53:35,478
That'll tip them off too soon.

395
00:53:35,588 --> 00:53:39,183
Find the kids. Do not engage the freak.
We need you alive.

396
00:53:39,692 --> 00:53:41,023
Roger that.

397
00:54:15,427 --> 00:54:17,622
He's going to do as he threatens, you know.

398
00:54:20,967 --> 00:54:22,126
Are you listening to me?

399
00:54:22,768 --> 00:54:25,397
I have to address the country in an hour.

400
00:54:25,505 --> 00:54:27,233
I can't discuss this with you right now.

401
00:54:27,873 --> 00:54:29,431
You are not alone in this.

402
00:54:30,008 --> 00:54:31,567
You think I don't know this?

403
00:54:32,011 --> 00:54:34,877
Sending in troops
was the act of a desperate man.

404
00:54:34,980 --> 00:54:36,778
That frightens me.

405
00:54:37,016 --> 00:54:38,573
They've left me with no choice.

406
00:54:38,817 --> 00:54:39,875
Yes they have.

407
00:54:40,118 --> 00:54:41,847
Is it right to sacrifice others' children
but not our own?

408
00:54:41,954 --> 00:54:42,944
And what then?

409
00:54:43,056 --> 00:54:44,023
What is proved?

410
00:54:46,658 --> 00:54:50,094
I am obliged to think beyond myself.

411
00:54:50,395 --> 00:54:52,295
Beyond our son and daughter.

412
00:54:52,464 --> 00:54:53,556
Obliged to what?

413
00:54:53,665 --> 00:54:55,600
Your image in history?

414
00:54:56,568 --> 00:55:00,197
If you allow something to happen to them,

415
00:55:01,039 --> 00:55:03,507
I will never forgive you.

416
00:55:57,695 --> 00:56:00,528
I hear two voices.
You guys picking this up? Over.

417
00:56:04,135 --> 00:56:07,229
There's a female voice.
That must be where he's got the kids.

418
00:56:26,090 --> 00:56:30,288
-We don't have all day, Miles.
-Yeah, right. Okay, Doctor, all right.

419
00:56:32,964 --> 00:56:37,333
Miles is gonna run the diagnostic today,
Andrew. Are you okay with that?

420
00:56:40,003 --> 00:56:43,303
-Yes.
-Okay, first question.

421
00:56:43,908 --> 00:56:46,569
You are a punctual and reliable person.

422
00:56:48,178 --> 00:56:49,237
Yes.

423
00:56:51,181 --> 00:56:54,241
You know how to make efficient use
of your time.

424
00:56:54,885 --> 00:56:55,909
Yes.

425
00:56:56,354 --> 00:57:00,255
Okay. Friends find you impulsive
and unpredictable.

426
00:57:01,826 --> 00:57:02,814
No.

427
00:57:03,727 --> 00:57:08,097
You like to spend leisure time relaxing
in a tranquil family atmosphere.

428
00:57:09,633 --> 00:57:10,657
Yes.

429
00:57:13,103 --> 00:57:16,004
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

430
00:57:21,778 --> 00:57:22,802
Yes.

431
00:57:26,383 --> 00:57:28,783
Andrew, did you hear the question?

432
00:57:31,021 --> 00:57:32,886
-Hook him up.
-Yes, sir.

433
00:57:41,097 --> 00:57:42,723
Okay, just a sec.

434
00:57:46,302 --> 00:57:49,099
Andrew, listen carefully.

435
00:57:50,673 --> 00:57:54,200
You often contemplate
the complexity of life.

436
00:57:57,313 --> 00:57:59,440
-No.
-That's right.

437
00:58:00,382 --> 00:58:03,249
You have to listen, Andrew. It's important.

438
00:58:42,224 --> 00:58:43,987
As the leader of a nation in crisis,

439
00:58:44,093 --> 00:58:49,190
my decisions have been dictated
by a single principle:

440
00:58:49,298 --> 00:58:51,959
to serve the common good of the people,

441
00:58:52,066 --> 00:58:54,126
no matter what might be sacrificed
in the process.

442
00:58:54,236 --> 00:58:58,968
While pride demands aggression
be met with aggression,

443
00:58:59,073 --> 00:59:02,908
humanity depends on diplomatic
and peaceful conflict resolution.

444
00:59:03,011 --> 00:59:06,913
It is therefore the responsibility
of those in positions of power

445
00:59:07,015 --> 00:59:11,451
to question any hard line policy

446
00:59:11,552 --> 00:59:13,783
that threatens survival as we know it.

447
00:59:13,889 --> 00:59:17,085
Therefore, I have authorized

448
00:59:17,191 --> 00:59:20,025
the release of 110 prisoners

449
00:59:20,129 --> 00:59:22,722
in exchange for immediate
deactivation of the detonator

450
00:59:22,830 --> 00:59:25,129
at Chernobyl reactor three.

451
00:59:25,234 --> 00:59:27,633
Over the next 48 hours

452
00:59:27,735 --> 00:59:32,070
all troops will stand down
in ceasefire mode,

453
00:59:32,173 --> 00:59:35,506
as the terms of exchange are implemented.

454
00:59:35,610 --> 00:59:38,511
The remaining prisoners
will then be released

455
00:59:38,646 --> 00:59:41,171
in exchange for the hostages.

456
00:59:54,662 --> 00:59:56,151
It's over, Luc.

457
01:00:16,651 --> 01:00:19,517
We might have had our share of differences,

458
01:00:20,420 --> 01:00:23,322
but it is the result that is important, yes?

459
01:00:25,392 --> 01:00:26,416
Yes.

460
01:00:27,227 --> 01:00:31,960
For a world leader to give in to the demands
of a small outfit such as our own,

461
01:00:33,867 --> 01:00:36,836
one should savor
the rarity of the experience.

462
01:00:38,004 --> 01:00:39,437
The thing is,

463
01:00:40,307 --> 01:00:45,438
to stop at this moment would be a shameful
waste of both leverage and position.

464
01:00:46,914 --> 01:00:48,676
Yeah, you're young, you'll learn,

465
01:00:48,782 --> 01:00:52,740
-but now we have to move...
-lt is over,

466
01:00:53,887 --> 01:00:57,755
-and that is that.
-That's not really for you to say,

467
01:00:58,858 --> 01:01:02,761
because there have been expenses.
Unanticipated expenses.

468
01:01:02,863 --> 01:01:07,323
It's hard to budget these things in advance.
Now, I have an army to build.

469
01:01:08,068 --> 01:01:12,300
And, like you said, moments like these
don't often present themselves.

470
01:01:12,539 --> 01:01:14,837
I don't think you're hearing me.

471
01:01:19,846 --> 01:01:23,440
You want to fuck around?
Is that what you're trying to do?

472
01:01:26,419 --> 01:01:28,079
You have been paid.

473
01:01:28,187 --> 01:01:31,351
You and me, our business together,
it is all over.

474
01:01:31,858 --> 01:01:33,916
You want to try to test me?

475
01:01:34,326 --> 01:01:36,955
Easy. Easy.

476
01:01:39,932 --> 01:01:41,331
Who is this?

477
01:01:43,002 --> 01:01:44,197
Vasilly!

478
01:02:23,208 --> 01:02:26,335
Okay. Very good.

479
01:02:27,613 --> 01:02:29,240
That's a good boy.

480
01:02:31,115 --> 01:02:32,742
We have to go now.

481
01:02:33,251 --> 01:02:36,153
You have to finish your job. Then we'll go.

482
01:02:39,591 --> 01:02:41,024
The children.

483
01:02:44,429 --> 01:02:46,398
Can I ask you a question?

484
01:02:48,099 --> 01:02:49,589
No, you cannot.

485
01:02:50,601 --> 01:02:54,833
You often contemplate
the complexity of life?

486
01:02:56,607 --> 01:02:59,838
Hey, it's not for you
to ask questions, understand?

487
01:03:05,416 --> 01:03:07,213
-Andrew.
-Yes or no?

488
01:03:08,486 --> 01:03:12,286
Andrew, you're tired.
You've been through a lot today.

489
01:03:13,691 --> 01:03:16,353
Are you a punctual and reliable person?

490
01:03:18,196 --> 01:03:20,892
I don't like your tone. Sit.

491
01:03:22,400 --> 01:03:25,426
-You answer my question.
-I'm not gonna...

492
01:03:26,604 --> 01:03:30,631
How do you feel? Do you feel warm?
Do you need me to cool you off?

493
01:03:31,309 --> 01:03:35,039
-Answer me. Answer my question.
-You answer my question.

494
01:03:35,345 --> 01:03:38,372
I'm not gonna an...
Andrew, I want you to sit down.

495
01:03:38,483 --> 01:03:44,388
I need to help... To cool you off now, please.
Sit down. I order you to sit!

496
01:03:45,655 --> 01:03:47,714
Stop it. You have to...

497
01:03:48,025 --> 01:03:50,017
You know how to put every minute
of your time to good purpose?

498
01:03:50,128 --> 01:03:52,891
-No! This is a mistake...
-Are you rested?

499
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:54,786
Are you happy?

500
01:03:55,333 --> 01:03:57,926
-Stop. Stop. No.
-Yes or no?

501
01:03:58,502 --> 01:04:02,405
You often think about humankind
and its destiny?

502
01:04:03,273 --> 01:04:04,570
Yes or no?

503
01:04:07,645 --> 01:04:08,872
Who am l?

504
01:04:39,276 --> 01:04:42,712
Be quiet. I'm on your side.
It's okay. It's okay.

505
01:04:43,179 --> 01:04:44,476
Are you one of them?

506
01:04:44,580 --> 01:04:47,379
-Who?
-One of the ones who can't be killed?

507
01:04:47,684 --> 01:04:51,950
Let's hope so. Now come with me
and be very quiet. Come on.

508
01:05:01,664 --> 01:05:04,691
Come on, let's go. Come on, let's go!

509
01:05:21,851 --> 01:05:24,012
Colonel, they've reactivated the detonators.

510
01:05:24,120 --> 01:05:26,987
-What the hell are you talking about?
-Look.

511
01:05:28,657 --> 01:05:30,522
What's the communication status
on Captain Burke?

512
01:05:30,626 --> 01:05:31,718
None.

513
01:05:33,729 --> 01:05:35,219
Game's back on.

514
01:06:16,437 --> 01:06:17,597
Communications are down.

515
01:06:17,705 --> 01:06:19,731
We've got no way of knowing
if anyone's alive over there.

516
01:06:19,842 --> 01:06:21,502
-What about Burke?
-Nothing.

517
01:06:21,609 --> 01:06:25,740
Is it possible your creation might have had
an episode, Dr. Porter?

518
01:06:25,981 --> 01:06:27,470
It's possible.

519
01:06:27,916 --> 01:06:30,942
Thirty minutes.
We're officially at Defcon One.

520
01:06:31,987 --> 01:06:33,146
Where are we with Deveraux?

521
01:06:33,254 --> 01:06:36,280
As he is right now,
he wouldn't stand a chance against the NGU.

522
01:06:36,391 --> 01:06:37,415
Dr. Fleming?

523
01:06:37,525 --> 01:06:40,119
If we proceed with the double dosage
and leave him something in reserve,

524
01:06:40,228 --> 01:06:42,788
-it's possible we can get him there.
-Then let's do it.

525
01:06:42,897 --> 01:06:45,058
But understand this is your last bullet.

526
01:06:45,166 --> 01:06:49,068
Assuming he survives, there'll be no
controlling him, no communication hookup.

527
01:06:49,170 --> 01:06:50,831
He'll know only
what he's been programmed for.

528
01:06:50,939 --> 01:06:53,533
To find those kids and stop the detonation.

529
01:06:53,641 --> 01:06:55,801
-Beyond that...
-Who's gonna dose him?

530
01:06:55,909 --> 01:06:59,505
-It's not gonna be safe in there. I'll do it.
-No, I will.

531
01:06:59,814 --> 01:07:01,371
I owe it to him.

532
01:07:29,010 --> 01:07:30,943
I know what's happening.

533
01:07:33,614 --> 01:07:36,845
-What is happening, Luc?
-I'm going back.

534
01:07:39,019 --> 01:07:40,749
I'm going to fight.

535
01:07:44,224 --> 01:07:45,282
Yeah.

536
01:07:48,895 --> 01:07:50,226
I remember.

537
01:07:58,405 --> 01:07:59,872
Give it to me.

538
01:08:02,276 --> 01:08:03,607
I'll do it.

539
01:08:05,344 --> 01:08:07,438
I want to be here with you.

540
01:08:10,250 --> 01:08:12,081
It's not safe for you.

541
01:08:13,587 --> 01:08:14,884
It's okay.

542
01:08:21,862 --> 01:08:23,021
Go now.

543
01:09:13,045 --> 01:09:14,033
Go.

544
01:14:52,112 --> 01:14:55,172
Run! Run! Get out of here!
Run! Go, go, go! Run!

545
01:15:58,945 --> 01:16:00,913
Fucking prick.

546
01:16:08,620 --> 01:16:10,452
Fucking prick...

547
01:18:21,552 --> 01:18:23,747
Keep asking them questions, just...

548
01:18:25,689 --> 01:18:29,056
Trying to get some... An answer.

549
01:18:32,462 --> 01:18:33,657
Nothing.

550
01:18:35,499 --> 01:18:37,433
Just a simple yes or no.

551
01:18:39,369 --> 01:18:40,928
It's ridiculous.

552
01:18:44,607 --> 01:18:47,076
I knew I had something to tell you.

553
01:18:48,679 --> 01:18:52,843
It was right there on the tip of my tongue.

554
01:18:54,785 --> 01:18:55,842
Shit.

555
01:18:58,054 --> 01:19:02,286
I'm sure I'll remember it in a minute, just...
Just wait right there.

556
01:19:05,262 --> 01:19:07,092
Something so familiar.

557
01:19:08,798 --> 01:19:10,425
Can't explain it.

558
01:19:12,403 --> 01:19:15,428
You know exactly
what I'm talking about, right?

559
01:19:16,005 --> 01:19:18,940
You understand. You don't have to answer.

560
01:19:21,344 --> 01:19:23,438
We're good like that, right?

561
01:19:30,987 --> 01:19:33,285
We've been over this all before.

562
01:19:42,165 --> 01:19:44,531
I'm just gonna do something here.

563
01:22:12,612 --> 01:22:15,514
I just remembered what I wanted to tell you.

564
01:22:19,620 --> 01:22:21,087
Wait a second.

565
01:22:50,818 --> 01:22:52,148
That's Luc.

566
01:22:54,354 --> 01:22:58,552
He's just used the booster shot.
Something must have slowed him down.

567
01:22:58,725 --> 01:23:01,626
We'll get another 20 good minutes
out of him.

568
01:23:02,662 --> 01:23:03,822
I hope.

569
01:24:15,000 --> 01:24:16,433
Come with me.
