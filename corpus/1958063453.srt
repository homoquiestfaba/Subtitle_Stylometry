- I'm sorry, I can't do it.

38
00:04:12,630 --> 00:04:14,330
- Your record is cleared.

39
00:04:15,210 --> 00:04:16,323
No identity.

40
00:04:18,013 --> 00:04:19,346
You don't exist.

41
00:04:20,693 --> 00:04:22,026
You don't exist.

42
00:04:23,373 --> 00:04:24,706
You don't exist.

43
00:04:26,133 --> 00:04:27,466
You don't exist.

44
00:06:21,630 --> 00:06:23,128
- I was wondering when he was going to

45
00:06:23,130 --> 00:06:25,378
try to cut all his loose ends.

46
00:06:25,380 --> 00:06:27,843
And doing this, what do
you think that makes you?

47
00:06:30,120 --> 00:06:31,888
It's just a vicious cycle.

48
00:06:31,890 --> 00:06:34,702
And when do you think it all ends for him?

49
00:06:37,410 --> 00:06:38,243
Does it hurt?

50
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:44,900
- When does it end?

51
00:06:53,400 --> 00:06:55,563
- Well, the dead has arisen.

52
00:06:56,870 --> 00:06:58,528
- Bone?

53
00:06:58,530 --> 00:07:00,230
- We thought you checked out, boy.

54
00:07:02,910 --> 00:07:04,228
- Oh, what's up?

55
00:07:04,230 --> 00:07:05,488
- Yeah, don't worry about that.

56
00:07:05,490 --> 00:07:08,548
We gonna take care of that
soon enough, all right?

57
00:07:08,550 --> 00:07:10,142
Glad you're back, man.

58
00:07:10,144 --> 00:07:10,975
- What?

59
00:07:10,977 --> 00:07:12,410
What happened?

60
00:07:14,940 --> 00:07:16,168
- So was there anything in particular

61
00:07:16,170 --> 00:07:17,308
that you're interested in?

62
00:07:17,310 --> 00:07:20,175
You need a two-door, four-door, SUV?

63
00:07:20,177 --> 00:07:21,508
- Nah, I just need something low-key

64
00:07:21,510 --> 00:07:23,098
so I can get back to Milwaukee.

65
00:07:23,100 --> 00:07:25,318
- Is there a
price range you wanna be in?

66
00:07:25,320 --> 00:07:26,776
- Don't matter the price.

67
00:07:26,778 --> 00:07:28,091
- I got you, okay.

68
00:07:28,093 --> 00:07:29,638
I might have a few things, though.

69
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:32,424
Let me grab some keys,
I think I got some cars.

70
00:07:32,426 --> 00:07:33,257
- Cool.

71
00:07:33,259 --> 00:07:35,056
- Be right back.

72
00:07:39,300 --> 00:07:41,290
- T.A., T.A., T.A.
- Fuck.

73
00:07:43,543 --> 00:07:44,728
- You know, you're a hard brother to find.

74
00:07:44,730 --> 00:07:46,143
Not good to show your face.

75
00:07:47,940 --> 00:07:49,858
- Figured I'd give myself
a moment to breathe.

76
00:07:49,860 --> 00:07:52,210
- Stupid and not like you,

77
00:07:52,212 --> 00:07:53,548
but apparently you've been doing

78
00:07:53,550 --> 00:07:54,628
a lot of things out of character.

79
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:55,531
- Come on now, nigga.

80
00:07:55,533 --> 00:07:58,134
That shit was faked, man.

81
00:07:58,136 --> 00:07:59,723
You know I don't get down like that.

82
00:08:00,570 --> 00:08:03,028
- Maybe, but that's not
a chance I could take.

83
00:08:03,030 --> 00:08:06,599
Plus, I'll be doing a lot of
other acquaintances a favor.

84
00:08:11,104 --> 00:08:13,198
- Now, you know you don't
gotta do this, right?

85
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,963
- I wouldn't do that if I was you.

86
00:08:14,965 --> 00:08:17,765
Might as well give that to
me and come on for this ride.

87
00:08:23,550 --> 00:08:24,928
Not completely stupid.

88
00:08:24,930 --> 00:08:25,954
Good.

89
00:09:03,420 --> 00:09:05,479
You seen which way he went?

90
00:09:05,481 --> 00:09:06,369
Fuck.

91
00:09:06,371 --> 00:09:07,202
- That motherfucker know we on his ass,

92
00:09:07,204 --> 00:09:09,988
so you know he ain't gonna
get caught slipping twice.

93
00:09:09,990 --> 00:09:11,608
- We make him come to us.

94
00:09:11,610 --> 00:09:15,401
Heard he got a girl back at
his old stomping grounds.

95
00:09:15,403 --> 00:09:16,918
- In motherfucking Milwaukee?

96
00:09:16,920 --> 00:09:17,878
- Let's see if he misses her.

97
00:09:17,880 --> 00:09:18,713
- You bet.

98
00:09:41,410 --> 00:09:42,603
- Agent Bender, sir.

99
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:46,531
Bender, sir.

100
00:09:46,533 --> 00:09:48,328
- What?

101
00:09:48,330 --> 00:09:49,408
What is it?

102
00:09:49,410 --> 00:09:50,788
- I followed up on a lead

103
00:09:50,790 --> 00:09:53,548
that's relating potentially
to the Little Dawn case.

104
00:09:53,550 --> 00:09:54,778
- Uh-huh.

105
00:09:54,780 --> 00:09:57,418
- You see, we've stumbled
across something big.

106
00:09:57,420 --> 00:10:00,328
Connections, networks,
and it puts all of us

107
00:10:00,330 --> 00:10:01,468
right in the center.

108
00:10:01,470 --> 00:10:02,938
- What do you need?

109
00:10:02,940 --> 00:10:05,758
- I need a all-hands-on-deck approach.

110
00:10:05,760 --> 00:10:08,758
- Miraflores, have you asked her for help?

111
00:10:08,760 --> 00:10:11,433
- Sir, this is more than just one person.

112
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:13,920
- What's she working on?

113
00:10:33,082 --> 00:10:34,121
- Stop!

114
00:10:38,823 --> 00:10:39,740
Don't move.

115
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:08,553
- I'm sorry.

116
00:11:11,820 --> 00:11:12,933
I know what I said,

117
00:11:15,240 --> 00:11:16,863
but I have to finish this.

118
00:11:21,900 --> 00:11:22,923
I have to go back.

119
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,115
- You hit hard with your strong ass.

120
00:11:36,117 --> 00:11:38,188
- Oh, I can hit a whole lot harder.

121
00:11:38,190 --> 00:11:39,021
Why'd you run?

122
00:11:39,023 --> 00:11:40,318
- Someone starts chasing me with a gun,

123
00:11:40,320 --> 00:11:41,218
I don't stick around.

124
00:11:41,220 --> 00:11:43,178
- You heard me yelling, and
I know you saw my badge.

125
00:11:43,180 --> 00:11:45,838
- I can get one of those
delivered to my house tomorrow.

126
00:11:45,840 --> 00:11:47,908
- There's a killing spree
going on in this city, okay?

127
00:11:47,910 --> 00:11:48,928
And the monster that did it

128
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:51,328
is staying at a warehouse you own.

129
00:11:51,330 --> 00:11:53,248
- Look, two envelopes filled with cash

130
00:11:53,250 --> 00:11:55,198
showed up in my PO box outta nowhere,

131
00:11:55,200 --> 00:11:56,638
talking about renting out my warehouse,

132
00:11:56,640 --> 00:11:58,738
pays for a given timeframe.

133
00:11:58,740 --> 00:11:59,668
- And?

134
00:11:59,670 --> 00:12:01,678
- And I accepted.

135
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:03,628
- Well, that seems unprofessional.

136
00:12:03,630 --> 00:12:04,618
- I got paid.

137
00:12:04,620 --> 00:12:06,118
That's all the professionalism I need.

138
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:07,828
- Yeah, that's right, 'cause you're a

139
00:12:07,830 --> 00:12:09,430
all-about-the-money type, right?

140
00:12:10,710 --> 00:12:12,402
- Thought you feds was
too busy getting killed

141
00:12:12,404 --> 00:12:14,534
to worry about little old me.

142
00:12:14,536 --> 00:12:15,538
- Good people died, you hear me?

143
00:12:15,540 --> 00:12:16,438
He paid for a spot.

144
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,179
Tell me who he is.

145
00:12:29,113 --> 00:12:29,968
Don't.

146
00:12:29,970 --> 00:12:31,055
- Don't what?

147
00:12:31,890 --> 00:12:33,598
- Don't try and talk me out of it.

148
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,038
- So you know it's a problem.

149
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:38,158
- The only problem is, is that
he's out there a free man.

150
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,178
I looked that monster in the
face and I didn't do anything.

151
00:12:40,180 --> 00:12:41,278
- Well, good.

152
00:12:41,280 --> 00:12:42,898
From everything you've told me,

153
00:12:42,900 --> 00:12:45,388
that's not enough evidence
to bring in a random guy.

154
00:12:45,390 --> 00:12:47,278
- That was his car in the parking lot.

155
00:12:47,280 --> 00:12:48,243
It was him.

156
00:12:49,320 --> 00:12:50,728
- Let's say you're right,

157
00:12:50,730 --> 00:12:53,008
with everything we know about him,

158
00:12:53,010 --> 00:12:54,658
and you try to take him alone,

159
00:12:54,660 --> 00:12:57,598
do you really think you'd be
standing here with me today?

160
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,043
You've got to let this go.

161
00:13:00,139 --> 00:13:01,888
- Man, you'd just think, with
a description of his face,

162
00:13:01,890 --> 00:13:04,318
there has to be something in the database.

163
00:13:04,320 --> 00:13:05,398
- And there wasn't.

164
00:13:05,400 --> 00:13:06,873
- With a skillset like that?

165
00:13:07,890 --> 00:13:10,618
There has to be a rap sheet or something.

166
00:13:10,620 --> 00:13:12,358
- Some people fall through the cracks.

167
00:13:12,360 --> 00:13:13,768
- Cracks?

168
00:13:13,770 --> 00:13:15,448
No one should be allowed
to walk through a city,

169
00:13:15,450 --> 00:13:18,598
flip it on its head, and
then just go about their day.

170
00:13:18,600 --> 00:13:19,858
- Look, you need to channel

171
00:13:19,860 --> 00:13:22,708
this energy into something constructive.

172
00:13:22,710 --> 00:13:24,358
Gruber's got this prison thing,

173
00:13:24,360 --> 00:13:27,358
scheme or something he told me about.

174
00:13:27,360 --> 00:13:29,483
Why don't you go see if
you can help him with that?

175
00:13:30,630 --> 00:13:32,308
- What about this Tyler?

176
00:13:32,310 --> 00:13:34,348
Maybe I ought to go see what he knows.

177
00:13:34,350 --> 00:13:35,818
- Tyler Franklin?

178
00:13:35,820 --> 00:13:37,108
- Yeah.

179
00:13:37,110 --> 00:13:38,728
- No, that's a no-go.

180
00:13:38,730 --> 00:13:41,548
Apparently we didn't cross
our t's and dot our i's.

181
00:13:41,550 --> 00:13:43,018
- He almost shot and killed an agent

182
00:13:43,020 --> 00:13:44,578
in the middle of a shootout.

183
00:13:44,580 --> 00:13:46,498
There's no double-checking needed.

184
00:13:46,500 --> 00:13:48,058
You can't be serious.

185
00:13:48,060 --> 00:13:49,563
- Goddamnit, I said no.

186
00:13:51,750 --> 00:13:52,583
- Sir.

187
00:13:53,850 --> 00:13:54,868
- The kid's a screw-up.

188
00:13:54,870 --> 00:13:56,518
He's gonna screw up again.

189
00:13:56,520 --> 00:13:58,258
- So we just give up.

190
00:13:58,260 --> 00:14:00,298
- Do I need to remind you that we won?

191
00:14:00,300 --> 00:14:01,833
- And I wonder at what cost.

192
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:33,598
- Who this?

193
00:14:33,600 --> 00:14:34,850
- Dorian, it's me, nigga.

194
00:14:35,940 --> 00:14:38,845
Look, I know you're in
Milwaukee right now,

195
00:14:38,847 --> 00:14:41,518
and I know what the fuck
you're trying to do too.

196
00:14:41,520 --> 00:14:42,486
- And what's that?

197
00:14:45,150 --> 00:14:48,684
- Yeah, I overheard your
loud ass last time we met up.

198
00:14:48,686 --> 00:14:50,428
- You're a sneaky little

199
00:14:50,430 --> 00:14:53,248
hiding motherfucker, just like a snake.

200
00:14:53,250 --> 00:14:55,228
- Nigga, listen carefully.

201
00:14:55,230 --> 00:14:57,088
I'm gonna say this one time.

202
00:14:57,090 --> 00:14:58,233
Don't do this shit.

203
00:14:59,445 --> 00:15:01,378
- Aw, a snake who's in love.

204
00:15:01,380 --> 00:15:03,183
Let me guess, you here too, huh?

205
00:15:05,700 --> 00:15:06,778
I'll take that as a yes.

206
00:15:06,780 --> 00:15:08,698
- Nigga, we go way back.

207
00:15:08,700 --> 00:15:10,185
- You got two options.

208
00:15:10,187 --> 00:15:11,457
- You ain't gotta do this shit.

209
00:15:11,459 --> 00:15:12,838
- Two options.

210
00:15:12,840 --> 00:15:14,640
You come with us and die like a man,

211
00:15:15,600 --> 00:15:17,878
or she's gonna die like
the bitch that she is.

212
00:15:17,880 --> 00:15:19,468
- So you wanna try to play me?

213
00:15:19,470 --> 00:15:21,748
- Don't test my patience.

214
00:15:21,750 --> 00:15:23,537
Call me when you're ready, bitch.

215
00:15:40,050 --> 00:15:42,418
- Man, I'm about sick and
tired of all this walking.

216
00:15:42,420 --> 00:15:44,398
- One more time around the block.

217
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,388
- I'm good.

218
00:15:45,390 --> 00:15:47,843
- No, you're lucky.

219
00:15:53,760 --> 00:15:55,678
- Bone, you didn't tell
me you was coming by.

220
00:15:55,680 --> 00:15:57,928
- My man, I just wanted
to come check on you, Ty.

221
00:15:57,930 --> 00:15:59,368
How you doing, man?

222
00:15:59,370 --> 00:16:01,627
- Ripping, still moving.

223
00:16:01,629 --> 00:16:03,268
- That's good, that's all that matters.

224
00:16:03,270 --> 00:16:04,111
- I can't thank you enough.

225
00:16:04,113 --> 00:16:06,748
- Man, listen, that's nothing.

226
00:16:06,750 --> 00:16:09,238
That's what we do, you understand?

227
00:16:09,240 --> 00:16:10,598
- Yeah.

228
00:16:10,600 --> 00:16:12,068
But you know, I don't know how or what,

229
00:16:12,070 --> 00:16:13,687
but I will repay you.

230
00:16:14,790 --> 00:16:15,723
- Gratitude.

231
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,323
That's what it is, man.

232
00:16:20,340 --> 00:16:23,368
That's the kind of energy
we need around us, baby.

233
00:16:23,370 --> 00:16:25,768
Somebody else gotta take over
this shit now, you feel me?

234
00:16:25,770 --> 00:16:26,762
- Take over?

235
00:16:26,764 --> 00:16:27,928
- Nigga, you funny.

236
00:16:27,930 --> 00:16:29,338
With T.A. and Key out the picture,

237
00:16:29,340 --> 00:16:30,903
somebody gotta take the reigns.

238
00:16:31,800 --> 00:16:33,658
Might as well be you.

239
00:16:33,660 --> 00:16:35,098
- That's a lot of responsibility.

240
00:16:35,100 --> 00:16:36,850
- And I'm glad you understand that.

241
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:40,893
So I'm gonna leave you two
lovebirds to it, all right?

242
00:16:42,000 --> 00:16:43,408
Get yourself together, man.

243
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:45,448
We got a lot of work to do, baby.

244
00:16:45,450 --> 00:16:46,975
- All right.

245
00:17:00,750 --> 00:17:03,573
- Hey, Miss, you wanna take a stroll?

246
00:17:04,608 --> 00:17:06,118
- That's sweet, but I'm not looking

247
00:17:06,120 --> 00:17:07,595
for a relationship right now.

248
00:17:07,597 --> 00:17:11,493
- Agent Miraflores,
I've been looking for you.

249
00:17:12,420 --> 00:17:13,785
- And why is that?

250
00:17:13,787 --> 00:17:16,318
- 'Cause I heard you're
looking for a killer,

251
00:17:16,320 --> 00:17:18,599
and I thought I might be of service.

252
00:17:18,601 --> 00:17:20,619
- Look, I don't have time for dead ends.

253
00:17:20,621 --> 00:17:24,038
- Well, how about a family member of his?

254
00:17:26,910 --> 00:17:28,650

00:17:37,242 --> 00:17:41,158
You wanna play a game or something?

260
00:17:41,160 --> 00:17:42,260
What's wrong with you?

261
00:17:43,470 --> 00:17:45,478
- When he said, "Run things,"

262
00:17:45,480 --> 00:17:47,130
do you think he meant everything?

263
00:17:48,468 --> 00:17:50,028
- I don't know.

264
00:17:50,030 --> 00:17:53,428
- Really, like, do you
know what this means?

265
00:17:53,430 --> 00:17:56,613
- I know I don't have a good
feeling about this or him.

266
00:17:58,860 --> 00:18:02,938
I was so excited to come
back home after graduation,

267
00:18:02,940 --> 00:18:06,028
but I had to come back
home to you in a coma.

268
00:18:06,030 --> 00:18:08,248
You know, at first, I
was supposed to be sad,

269
00:18:08,250 --> 00:18:10,528
but I was more mad that you put yourself

270
00:18:10,530 --> 00:18:11,883
in this type of situation.

271
00:18:12,810 --> 00:18:15,628
Then I thought, "Maybe he
would wake up and realize

272
00:18:15,630 --> 00:18:18,268
that you don't belong up
in this type of world."

273
00:18:18,270 --> 00:18:21,395
And I'll be here to help
you walk right away from it.

274
00:18:21,397 --> 00:18:26,248
And here you is, ready to go
right back into it.

275
00:18:26,250 --> 00:18:28,187
- I can't just walk away.

276
00:18:28,189 --> 00:18:29,878
- Yes, you can, Tyler.

277
00:18:29,880 --> 00:18:31,108
This isn't your life.

278
00:18:31,110 --> 00:18:31,943
- Look around.

279
00:18:32,820 --> 00:18:34,523
I'm an orphan that came from the dirt.

280
00:18:35,670 --> 00:18:38,343
No help, no assistance, no love.

281
00:18:40,040 --> 00:18:42,577
How do you think I got here, honest work?

282
00:18:42,579 --> 00:18:44,878
- Tyler, you do have someone.

283
00:18:44,880 --> 00:18:45,797
- Angela...

284
00:18:48,198 --> 00:18:50,615
- Tyler, my family is moving.

285
00:18:51,873 --> 00:18:53,060
- And?

286
00:18:53,062 --> 00:18:55,229
- And they want me to go with them.

287
00:18:55,231 --> 00:18:57,090
- You a grown-ass woman.

288
00:18:57,092 --> 00:18:58,891
You don't gotta go nowhere
you don't wanna go.

289
00:18:58,893 --> 00:19:00,663
What about that nice job you got?

290
00:19:01,560 --> 00:19:03,928
- The city's starting to
be too violent for them.

291
00:19:03,930 --> 00:19:06,480
And I believe it's a little
too violent for me too.

292
00:19:07,650 --> 00:19:09,405
- What about us?

293
00:19:09,407 --> 00:19:10,885
What do you want?

294
00:19:10,887 --> 00:19:14,263
- I want a reason to stay.

297
00:19:20,160 --> 00:19:22,648
- I heard about the bodies
piling up in Milwaukee,

298
00:19:22,650 --> 00:19:26,163
and I only know one man that
can create that kind of ruckus.

299
00:19:28,680 --> 00:19:30,118
- Okay, and who are you?

300
00:19:30,120 --> 00:19:31,622
- Reginald Banks.

301
00:19:31,624 --> 00:19:33,628
He is my nephew.

302
00:19:33,630 --> 00:19:36,508
My niece, bless her sweet soul,

303
00:19:36,510 --> 00:19:39,268
I finally got custody of
her when she was seven.

304
00:19:39,270 --> 00:19:40,508
They were married when
they were in their 20s.

305
00:19:40,510 --> 00:19:42,598
- Okay, listen, I can get a history lesson

306
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:44,068
some other time, okay?

307
00:19:44,070 --> 00:19:46,588
I need the important stuff, like his name,

308
00:19:46,590 --> 00:19:48,663
where he lays his head, stuff like that.

309
00:19:49,960 --> 00:19:51,838
- But I think you need to know who he is

310
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,538
and understand why he is the way he is

311
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:55,640
if you wanna stop him.

312
00:19:56,580 --> 00:19:58,593
You remember the Moncado sweep?

313
00:19:59,910 --> 00:20:03,088
- Yeah, the disappearance
of the ACEs Organization.

314
00:20:03,090 --> 00:20:04,588
It was a bloodbath,

315
00:20:04,590 --> 00:20:06,328
but I thought it was some
government conspiracy

316
00:20:06,330 --> 00:20:07,161
that wiped 'em out.

317
00:20:07,163 --> 00:20:09,748
It had to be, for all of them
to end up dead like that.

318
00:20:09,750 --> 00:20:14,308
- Nah, no group, no
secret government agents.

319
00:20:14,310 --> 00:20:15,153
Just one man.

320
00:20:16,170 --> 00:20:17,128
- Not possible.

321
00:20:17,130 --> 00:20:18,030
- You would think.

322
00:20:19,020 --> 00:20:22,678
But what they did unleashed
an evil in him that I see now

323
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:24,080
that he can't even turn off.

324
00:20:25,950 --> 00:20:27,538
He's a different breed, Miraflores,

325
00:20:27,540 --> 00:20:28,840
and I think you know that.

326
00:20:31,419 --> 00:20:32,908
You know, he's not perfect.

327
00:20:32,910 --> 00:20:35,177
No killing machine is.

328
00:20:35,179 --> 00:20:36,838
And what they did to his daughter,

329
00:20:36,840 --> 00:20:39,268
to my niece, was unimaginable.

330
00:20:39,270 --> 00:20:40,408
And you ask yourself maybe

331
00:20:40,410 --> 00:20:42,610
why I didn't try to
talk him out of it then.

332
00:20:43,743 --> 00:20:46,173
I don't know, but I can't sit back now.

333
00:20:48,030 --> 00:20:49,528
The death has to stop.

334
00:20:49,530 --> 00:20:51,238
- And I couldn't agree with you more.

335
00:20:51,240 --> 00:20:54,573
But until you give me a name,
there's nothing I can do.

336
00:20:56,770 --> 00:20:57,993
- I can give you three.

337
00:21:14,250 --> 00:21:15,083
- No, no.

338
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:17,608
Stay home.

339
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:18,603

You have to let it go, please.

397
00:23:52,530 --> 00:23:54,058
This is not about family anymore,

398
00:23:54,060 --> 00:23:55,528
and this is not what they would want.

399
00:23:55,530 --> 00:23:57,683
- There's a lot of things
they wouldn't have wanted.

00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:12,621
- No.

404
00:24:12,623 --> 00:24:14,609
- Come on, you haven't even
heard what I have to say yet.

405
00:24:14,611 --> 00:24:15,928
- You still working that hitman case?

406
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:16,761
- Yes.

407
00:24:16,763 --> 00:24:17,594
- Then no.

408
00:24:17,596 --> 00:24:19,978
- I'm so close to having
something good on him.

409
00:24:19,980 --> 00:24:22,330
- What do you charge a
man that can't be found?

410
00:24:24,180 --> 00:24:25,013
- You're scared.

411
00:24:26,550 --> 00:24:27,383
Why?

412
00:24:28,470 --> 00:24:29,608
You used to work close with Bender,

413
00:24:29,610 --> 00:24:31,228
that's the reason I came
to you in the first place.

414
00:24:31,230 --> 00:24:32,158
- Too many people close to him

415
00:24:32,160 --> 00:24:33,808
have ended up dead or missing,

416
00:24:33,810 --> 00:24:35,128
and I want no part of it.

417
00:24:35,130 --> 00:24:36,903
- This case or Bender?

418
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,268
- Both.

419
00:24:39,270 --> 00:24:40,867
- You don't trust him.

420
00:24:40,869 --> 00:24:43,263
- I don't trust anyone, especially you.

421
00:24:44,370 --> 00:24:45,543
- You swore an oath.

422
00:24:54,870 --> 00:24:57,270
I have something that can
make everything right.

423
00:25:03,840 --> 00:25:05,240
- This is my private number.

424
00:25:06,120 --> 00:25:08,320
Only call me if you
have something concrete.

425
00:25:29,460 --> 00:25:30,291
- Yeah.

426
00:25:30,293 --> 00:25:32,278
- US Attorney O'Malley,

427
00:25:32,280 --> 00:25:33,904
we need to get eyes on him.

428
00:25:37,117 --> 00:25:39,028
- How come I didn't
know about this place?

429
00:25:39,030 --> 00:25:40,443
- It's above your pay grade.

430
00:25:41,580 --> 00:25:43,138
- Why?

431
00:25:43,140 --> 00:25:43,973
- You'll see.

432
00:25:46,440 --> 00:25:48,328
- Another disloyal-ass nigga.

433
00:25:48,330 --> 00:25:50,193
My, these niggas.

434
00:25:51,300 --> 00:25:52,678
I swear, nigga, I thought you was

435
00:25:52,680 --> 00:25:54,033
a better nigga than that.

436
00:25:55,428 --> 00:25:57,178
You already had to kill his cousin.

437
00:26:04,842 --> 00:26:08,171
Man, these motherfuckers,
man, I swear to God.

438
00:26:08,173 --> 00:26:09,808
- Who the fuck is that?

439
00:26:09,810 --> 00:26:11,638
- Some clown who thought
it was a good idea

440
00:26:11,640 --> 00:26:13,048
to try to take advantage of us

441
00:26:13,050 --> 00:26:14,950
when we thought we was at a weak spot.

442
00:26:15,930 --> 00:26:17,913
So this nigger's name is The Messenger.

443
00:26:21,150 --> 00:26:22,330
That's who that is.

444
00:26:27,150 --> 00:26:28,828
- That ain't shit.

445
00:26:28,830 --> 00:26:30,178
You seen this shit before.

446
00:26:30,180 --> 00:26:31,067
You a body.

447
00:26:35,990 --> 00:26:37,888
- He probably going to clean the shit

448
00:26:37,890 --> 00:26:41,310
out his pants right now, man.

449
00:26:43,320 --> 00:26:45,898
- Man, what happened to you, man?

450
00:26:45,900 --> 00:26:46,733
Man up.

451
00:26:52,208 --> 00:26:54,838
- You know you need somebody
that can handle this shit.

452
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:58,680
Ty, my guy, he can grow
into it in due time.

453
00:27:01,058 --> 00:27:02,641
But do we got time?

454
00:27:03,786 --> 00:27:05,772
Let's get this nigger up outta here, man.

455
00:27:18,180 --> 00:27:19,760
- You should've left me alone.

456
00:27:19,762 --> 00:27:21,778
- You should have done a
better job at disappearing.

457
00:27:21,780 --> 00:27:23,520
- My files, are they gone?

458
00:27:23,522 --> 00:27:26,998
- Did you think
I'd completely erase them?

459
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:27,831
Don't worry, they're not

460
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:30,135
in the system, but they're somewhere.

461
00:27:30,137 --> 00:27:31,117
- Where?

462
00:27:31,119 --> 00:27:32,319
- Why don't you ask him?

463
00:27:35,040 --> 00:27:36,808
- No flashing your badges?

464
00:27:36,810 --> 00:27:38,908
No reading me my rights?

465
00:27:38,910 --> 00:27:40,744
- No, this one's off the books.

466
00:27:50,130 --> 00:27:52,083
You were an idiot for coming here.

467
00:27:53,378 --> 00:27:54,838
It's not like you.

468
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,403
It's almost like you wanna die.

469
00:27:58,080 --> 00:28:00,868
Holy shit, you do wanna die.

470
00:28:00,870 --> 00:28:03,208
Well, the good news is,
is that's gonna happen.

471
00:28:03,210 --> 00:28:04,648
But it's up to you on how painful

472
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,303
the experience is gonna be.

473
00:28:07,950 --> 00:28:09,598
Who did you tell?

474
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:10,893
- Tell who what?

475
00:28:13,800 --> 00:28:15,033
- Who knows about me?

476
00:28:16,380 --> 00:28:17,458
I need names.

477
00:28:17,460 --> 00:28:18,808
- I got nothing for you.

478
00:28:18,810 --> 00:28:21,718
- I'm gonna ask you one last time.

479
00:28:21,720 --> 00:28:22,678
Who knows about me?

480
00:28:22,680 --> 00:28:26,926
- You're paranoid, and this
isn't gonna end well for you.

481
00:28:26,928 --> 00:28:28,798
You can't cover up everything.

482
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:29,733
- I don't have to.

483
00:28:30,840 --> 00:28:33,958
I've got everything on
everyone, including you.

484
00:28:33,960 --> 00:28:37,138
If I go down, this gets leaked.

485
00:28:37,140 --> 00:28:39,628
You see, I will always win.

486
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,678
We will always win,

487
00:28:40,680 --> 00:28:42,975
because we understand the
necessity of what we do.

488
00:28:43,810 --> 00:28:44,713
What the fuck was that?

489
00:28:44,715 --> 00:28:46,148
- A dislocated thumb.

490
00:28:47,179 --> 00:28:48,512
- Fuck.

491
00:28:52,978 --> 00:28:55,078
- Damn,
these motherfuckers, man,

492
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,957
I swear to God.

493
00:28:57,923 --> 00:28:58,946
Bitch-ass nigger.

494
00:29:07,680 --> 00:29:10,888
- Baby, I can barely keep
eye contact with anyone.

495
00:29:10,890 --> 00:29:15,513
Can't eat, can't sleep,
can't even think straight.

496
00:29:17,280 --> 00:29:18,243
I feel unstable.

497
00:29:20,340 --> 00:29:21,840
But thanks for coming, though.

498
00:29:22,980 --> 00:29:23,813
I needed this.

499
00:29:26,473 --> 00:29:28,791
You know, when I'm around you,

500
00:29:28,793 --> 00:29:30,393
I feel like I can breathe again.

501
00:29:32,250 --> 00:29:33,550
- You need to go get help.

502
00:29:34,410 --> 00:29:36,358
You need to go see somebody.

503
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:39,203
People aren't meant to experience
the things that you have.

504
00:29:40,320 --> 00:29:41,153
- I can't.

505
00:29:42,360 --> 00:29:44,635
- Don't say you can't afford it.

506
00:29:44,637 --> 00:29:45,873
- I'm just too busy.

507
00:29:46,920 --> 00:29:49,378
- What, too busy with Bone?

508
00:29:49,380 --> 00:29:50,580
Don't seem like it help.

509
00:29:51,750 --> 00:29:52,918
- It doesn't matter.

510
00:29:52,920 --> 00:29:54,868
- But you do.

511
00:29:54,870 --> 00:29:55,770
Don't forget that.

512
00:29:58,050 --> 00:29:59,146
- Make sure
your motherfucking pipe

513
00:29:59,148 --> 00:30:01,528
ain't on safety, too, nigga.

514
00:30:01,530 --> 00:30:04,044
- Nigga, Glocks ain't got no safety.

515
00:30:04,046 --> 00:30:05,496
- Fuck up.

516
00:30:08,773 --> 00:30:10,101
I don't like that shirt, you know?

517
00:30:10,103 --> 00:30:11,853
- I don't like your mustache.

518
00:30:12,870 --> 00:30:15,058
- You thought you was
on a fucking X-Men movie

519
00:30:15,060 --> 00:30:16,010
with that shirt on?

520
00:30:16,860 --> 00:30:17,763
Dumb-ass shit.

521
00:30:18,900 --> 00:30:21,238
- Man, that's how you gonna do it?

522
00:30:21,240 --> 00:30:22,618
- Man, where the fuck is this bitch at?

523
00:30:22,620 --> 00:30:25,528
- Man, I don't know,
but he need to hurry up.

524
00:30:25,530 --> 00:30:27,275
Man, I don't know what's going on.

525
00:30:27,277 --> 00:30:29,127
- Oh shit, here this nigger go again.

526
00:30:30,120 --> 00:30:31,120
Fuck dude want, bro?

527
00:30:34,050 --> 00:30:34,953
- Change?

528
00:30:36,360 --> 00:30:37,191
Change?

529
00:30:37,193 --> 00:30:38,684
- Man, I ain't got no fucking change, man.

530
00:30:38,686 --> 00:30:40,200
- Change?

531
00:30:46,170 --> 00:30:48,958
Now, where the fuck is Dorian at, nigger?

532
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:50,967
- 4919 North 19th, nigger.

533
00:31:01,680 --> 00:31:03,808
- Ah, about damn time.

534
00:31:03,810 --> 00:31:05,728
I wasn't gonna wait too
much motherfucking longer.

535
00:31:05,730 --> 00:31:07,408
You ready to man up?

536
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:08,771
- You shouldn't have come here.

537
00:31:08,773 --> 00:31:10,408
- I can go wherever the fuck I please.

538
00:31:10,410 --> 00:31:12,418
You know, like that little restaurant

539
00:31:12,420 --> 00:31:13,978
where that pretty little thing works at.

540
00:31:13,980 --> 00:31:15,724
- You sure you wanna do this?

541
00:31:15,726 --> 00:31:17,401
- 100%.

542
00:31:17,403 --> 00:31:19,738
Hey, listen, leave me waiting any longer,

543
00:31:19,740 --> 00:31:21,520
and that bitch dead tonight.

544
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,340
- Was a third option, motherfucker.

545
00:31:47,340 --> 00:31:48,701
- T.A.?

546
00:31:56,910 --> 00:31:58,648
- Nigger, I thought you was dead.

547
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,928
- Me too, but I'm still alive.

548
00:32:00,930 --> 00:32:02,428
- And free.

549
00:32:02,430 --> 00:32:03,333
- I know, crazy.

550
00:32:04,980 --> 00:32:06,808
You know what they said about you?

551
00:32:06,810 --> 00:32:07,810
I know you wouldn't.

552
00:32:08,831 --> 00:32:10,331
- I know you know.

553
00:32:11,775 --> 00:32:14,802
There's some other niggers
that I'm worried about.

554
00:32:14,804 --> 00:32:16,137
- Bone's nephew.

555
00:32:18,060 --> 00:32:20,643
But thanks to you, I got put on top.

556
00:32:22,470 --> 00:32:23,303
- On top, huh?

557
00:32:27,060 --> 00:32:28,360
Congratulations, li'l bro.

558
00:32:29,304 --> 00:32:30,683
You're moving up in the world.

559
00:32:32,280 --> 00:32:34,078
- You should come by,
check us out sometime.

560
00:32:34,080 --> 00:32:35,953
You know I got your back.

561
00:32:35,955 --> 00:32:38,608
- Nah, I'ma lay low for a little bit.

562
00:32:38,610 --> 00:32:40,613
But I'ma beat through for sure.

563
00:32:59,768 --> 00:33:00,601
- Whoa.

564
00:33:01,500 --> 00:33:02,578
Bar fight?

565
00:33:02,580 --> 00:33:03,413
- What?

566
00:33:04,290 --> 00:33:05,698
Oh, long story.

567
00:33:05,700 --> 00:33:07,558
Anyway, what do you need?

568
00:33:07,560 --> 00:33:08,463
- What's going on?

569
00:33:09,330 --> 00:33:10,498
- There were a string of homicides

570
00:33:10,500 --> 00:33:12,388
last night that look targeted.

571
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,788
- Well, and the local PD can't handle it?

572
00:33:14,790 --> 00:33:17,488
- Miraflores, it's his work.

573
00:33:17,490 --> 00:33:19,348
Our favorite hitman, he's back.

574
00:33:19,350 --> 00:33:20,811
- And I'm the last to know?

575
00:33:20,813 --> 00:33:23,068
- Knowing you, I figured
you were already on it.

576
00:33:23,070 --> 00:33:24,770
- Well, how am I supposed to know?

577
00:33:25,950 --> 00:33:28,438
- You make any headway on his identity?

578
00:33:28,440 --> 00:33:29,390
- No.

579
00:33:29,392 --> 00:33:33,063
- You need to come to me
with any new info directly.

580
00:33:52,140 --> 00:33:53,130
- What's up, man?

581
00:33:54,120 --> 00:33:55,118
- I'm good.

582
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:56,179
- Just checking on you, man.

583
00:33:56,181 --> 00:33:57,715
You gonna bring this place down.

584
00:33:57,717 --> 00:33:59,458
- I'm just taking it all in.

585
00:33:59,460 --> 00:34:01,310
- Good, 'cause it's all yours, homie.

586
00:34:02,610 --> 00:34:04,133
- And you won't believe who's back.

587
00:34:05,580 --> 00:34:07,108
- Don't tell me.

588
00:34:07,110 --> 00:34:07,943
- T.A.

589
00:34:09,120 --> 00:34:10,053
- Wow.

590
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:12,893
- Told him to come by, but you know,

591
00:34:12,895 --> 00:34:14,543
he wanted to lay low for a minute.

592
00:34:15,474 --> 00:34:16,305
- Man, I never even thought

593
00:34:16,307 --> 00:34:19,305
he would've came back, that's all.

594
00:34:19,307 --> 00:34:20,493
That's good, though.

595
00:34:21,930 --> 00:34:24,148
He just gave another reason to celebrate.

596
00:34:24,150 --> 00:34:25,655
Go grab us a waitress.

- Goodbye, guys.

604
00:34:58,654 --> 00:34:59,487
- No!

605
00:35:02,205 --> 00:35:03,400
Jesse?

606
00:35:03,402 --> 00:35:04,235
Oh no!

607
00:35:06,230 --> 00:35:07,980
No, no, baby, no, no.

608
00:35:09,150 --> 00:35:09,983
No, no!

609
00:35:21,603 --> 00:35:24,478
- It's been a while
since we met like this.

610
00:35:24,480 --> 00:35:25,313
Must be big.

611
00:35:26,910 --> 00:35:29,248
- There was an execution-style
shooting last night.

612
00:35:29,250 --> 00:35:31,468
Suspect was wearing a black face mask.

613
00:35:31,470 --> 00:35:33,033
- He really is back.

614
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:36,088
Well, why just bring me in?

615
00:35:36,090 --> 00:35:38,218
We need everyone on this.

616
00:35:38,220 --> 00:35:39,298
- In due time.

617
00:35:39,300 --> 00:35:41,428
But first, I need you to tell me

618
00:35:41,430 --> 00:35:43,828
everything you've gathered about him.

619
00:35:43,830 --> 00:35:45,380
- It's not much, you know that.

620
00:35:46,230 --> 00:35:47,830
- So who've you been talking to?

621
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:52,708
When are the lies gonna stop?

622
00:35:52,710 --> 00:35:54,058
I know you know something.

623
00:35:54,060 --> 00:35:56,341
- Yeah, and I can say
the same thing to you.

624
00:35:56,343 --> 00:35:59,433
- I know you've been talking
to Attorney O'Malley.

625
00:36:01,548 --> 00:36:04,093
I hate what has to happen next.

626
00:36:06,450 --> 00:36:07,953
- When did you lose your soul?

627
00:36:08,820 --> 00:36:11,068
The murders, are they really him?

628
00:36:11,070 --> 00:36:12,388
- I don't know, I don't care.

629
00:36:12,390 --> 00:36:14,818
We got more important
issues to worry about.

630
00:36:14,820 --> 00:36:17,313
- Yes, you do.

631
00:36:19,470 --> 00:36:20,670
I'm glad we're all here.

632
00:36:22,680 --> 00:36:24,778
Did you tell her who hired me?

633
00:36:24,780 --> 00:36:27,208
Like I believe you said,
"Cleanse the city."

634
00:36:27,210 --> 00:36:28,468
- I did what I had to.

635
00:36:28,470 --> 00:36:30,178
- And what was that?

636
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:31,918
- I took responsibility.

637
00:36:31,920 --> 00:36:34,048
I took on the burden of everyone's sins.

638
00:36:34,050 --> 00:36:36,238
- That job's already taken.

639
00:36:36,240 --> 00:36:38,728
- You were just a tool for bloodshed.

640
00:36:38,730 --> 00:36:41,068
- But yet you tried to get me killed?

641
00:36:41,070 --> 00:36:44,218
- Some tools gotta be thrown
away after their first use.

642
00:36:44,220 --> 00:36:45,238
- Stop.

643
00:36:45,240 --> 00:36:46,588
Good people died.

644
00:36:46,590 --> 00:36:47,638
And if you're the one to blame,

645
00:36:47,640 --> 00:36:49,790
then maybe you won't
be leaving here alive.

646
00:36:54,450 --> 00:36:55,648
- Bone.

647
00:36:55,650 --> 00:36:57,688
Bone is the other side of the coin.

648
00:36:57,690 --> 00:36:59,218
He understands.

649
00:36:59,220 --> 00:37:00,928
- No, I did my research.

650
00:37:00,930 --> 00:37:03,628
He's just T.A.'s cousin
with a few connections.

651
00:37:03,630 --> 00:37:04,803
- Connections, indeed.

652
00:37:05,880 --> 00:37:09,123
He understands balance and order,

653
00:37:10,080 --> 00:37:12,358
which the two of you could be a part of.

654
00:37:12,360 --> 00:37:15,778
- Two guns to your head, and
now you want us to team up?

655
00:37:15,780 --> 00:37:18,088
I don't think so.

656
00:37:18,090 --> 00:37:19,588
- No, stop.

657
00:37:19,590 --> 00:37:20,698
Both of you are going in.

658
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:21,628
- He's not leaving alive.

659
00:37:21,630 --> 00:37:23,698
- You're not making the shots, okay?

660
00:37:23,700 --> 00:37:24,531
I am.

661
00:37:24,533 --> 00:37:25,738
You're not calling 'em for me.

662
00:37:25,740 --> 00:37:27,748
- He's not leaving alive.

663
00:37:27,750 --> 00:37:29,278
- Are you just gonna give
him the easy way out?

664
00:37:29,280 --> 00:37:31,948
He has to face the consequences.

665
00:37:31,950 --> 00:37:34,798
- Cute, but my plan's more effective.

666
00:37:34,800 --> 00:37:36,570
- And where has that gotten you?

667
00:38:03,144 --> 00:38:06,958
- And so they took everything from me.

668
00:38:06,960 --> 00:38:11,343
They didn't deserve what
those monsters did to them.

669
00:38:13,050 --> 00:38:15,903
There's no purpose, no life.

670
00:38:16,920 --> 00:38:20,638
Choices are made by the
ones with the biggest stick.

671
00:38:20,640 --> 00:38:22,168
- Do you believe that?

672
00:38:22,170 --> 00:38:23,509
- Does it matter?

673
00:38:23,511 --> 00:38:26,998
- Dimitri, is
that what they believed?

674
00:38:27,000 --> 00:38:28,648
- Don't.

675
00:38:28,650 --> 00:38:30,148
- Allayah and Alana?

676
00:38:30,150 --> 00:38:32,717
- Uncle already told you everything, huh?

677
00:38:33,570 --> 00:38:34,798
- Enough.

678
00:38:34,800 --> 00:38:37,348
We both just want this
senseless violence to stop.

679
00:38:37,350 --> 00:38:39,153
- It's all senseless, isn't it?

680
00:38:40,410 --> 00:38:42,053
- You're the one to talk.

681
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,508
- I'm the one to finish it.

682
00:38:45,510 --> 00:38:48,460
- The mayhem, it
won't stop with you, will it?

683
00:38:49,800 --> 00:38:51,200
What if we just finished it?

684
00:38:52,110 --> 00:38:52,943
All of it.

685
00:38:54,600 --> 00:38:55,978
This has to come to an end.

686
00:38:55,980 --> 00:38:57,898
Everyone has to go down,

687
00:38:57,900 --> 00:38:59,398
which in turn means you won't have to

688
00:38:59,400 --> 00:39:01,108
keep looking over your shoulder.

689
00:39:01,110 --> 00:39:03,058
I can't give you a way out like you want,

690
00:39:03,060 --> 00:39:05,158
but how about a peaceful night of sleep?

691
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,898
- This could all be pinned on Bender.

692
00:39:06,900 --> 00:39:08,848
- That's
just gonna bring him down.

693
00:39:08,850 --> 00:39:10,850
He has to have some sort of paper trail.

694
00:39:13,350 --> 00:39:16,113
- His hard drive, it's
how he protects himself.

695
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,398
It'll have all the evidence you'll need.

696
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:21,478
- Can you get it?

697
00:39:21,480 --> 00:39:24,723
- You mean you need me to
do the illegal stuff, right?

698
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:27,178
- Look, if you get it to me,

699
00:39:27,180 --> 00:39:29,488
I can get it to the right person.

700
00:39:29,490 --> 00:39:31,918
- You must be hopeless.

701
00:39:31,920 --> 00:39:33,058
- Call it angry.

702
00:39:33,060 --> 00:39:36,448
You know, I made myself a
promise that when I found you,

703
00:39:36,450 --> 00:39:38,428
I wouldn't let you get away again.

704
00:39:38,430 --> 00:39:43,078
- Well, it looks like I'm
not going anywhere for now.

705
00:39:43,080 --> 00:39:44,218
- And Bender?

706
00:39:44,220 --> 00:39:46,378
- The idiot is paranoid.

707
00:39:46,380 --> 00:39:47,698
We'll find him.

708
00:39:47,700 --> 00:39:49,498
We just have to wait on him to slip up.

709
00:39:49,500 --> 00:39:50,728
- We'll need to
figure out a way to get the-

710
00:39:50,730 --> 00:39:52,618
- I'll take care of it.

711
00:39:52,620 --> 00:39:53,703
Just give me time.

712
00:39:54,690 --> 00:39:56,903
- How could
I possibly trust you?

713
00:39:57,750 --> 00:40:00,170
- Trust my need for revenge.

714
00:40:16,181 --> 00:40:18,281
- Where the fuck is this fat motherfucker?

715
00:40:24,540 --> 00:40:26,218
It's about damn time.

716
00:40:26,220 --> 00:40:27,453
- Are you serious?

717
00:40:28,740 --> 00:40:30,358
FBI's all over my ass.

718
00:40:30,360 --> 00:40:33,118
I can't take a piss without
looking over my shoulder,

719
00:40:33,120 --> 00:40:35,788
and you're sitting here just
like it's a perfect day.

720
00:40:35,790 --> 00:40:36,688
- That hard to leave?

721
00:40:36,690 --> 00:40:39,628
- What do you think
I've been trying to do?

722
00:40:39,630 --> 00:40:41,488
And it takes you two
weeks after I've been made

723
00:40:41,490 --> 00:40:43,078
to answer my calls?

724
00:40:43,080 --> 00:40:44,163
I need a way out.

725
00:40:45,243 --> 00:40:46,408
- And you come to me for that?

726
00:40:46,410 --> 00:40:47,661
- After all I've done,
it's the least you owe me.

727
00:40:47,663 --> 00:40:49,413
- I don't owe you shit.

728
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,600
I just happen to be your only
option of a fast getaway.

729
00:40:55,500 --> 00:40:57,478
They froze all your accounts,

730
00:40:57,480 --> 00:40:59,488
got all kind of warrants on your ass,

731
00:40:59,490 --> 00:41:02,398
and you can't get in touch
with your other connections.

732
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:04,270
Don't forget who you're
talking to, Bender.

733
00:41:04,272 --> 00:41:05,878
- Oh, I know who I'm talking to,

734
00:41:05,880 --> 00:41:07,495
but if I go down, you go down too.

735
00:41:07,497 --> 00:41:08,973
- You like casinos?

736
00:41:10,500 --> 00:41:14,215
I like a nice night at
Potawatomi every now and then.

737
00:41:14,217 --> 00:41:15,448
- And your point?

738
00:41:15,450 --> 00:41:17,493
- I'm a humble, simple, betting man.

739
00:41:18,330 --> 00:41:21,633
And for a while, you
were actually a good bet.

740
00:41:22,800 --> 00:41:25,803
The eyes on you now, not so good.

741
00:41:29,130 --> 00:41:30,013
- Bone, don't do this.

742
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:31,918
- Make it look like a suicide.

743
00:41:31,920 --> 00:41:33,388

stress of what he did

744

to this great city of his.

745
00:41:35,010 --> 00:41:37,348
- I know you know about the hard drive.

746
00:41:37,350 --> 00:41:39,148
I got people who will release that info

747
00:41:39,150 --> 00:41:40,858
if anything happens to me.

748
00:41:40,860 --> 00:41:42,274
- You mean this hard drive?

749
00:41:48,236 --> 00:41:49,978
Careful who you trust, Bender.

750
00:41:49,980 --> 00:41:52,468

money more than relationships.

you, this is how it ends?

Hello.

837
00:45:39,810 --> 00:45:42,723
My name is Jacobi Norman.

838
00:45:44,820 --> 00:45:46,883
Don't worry about a
title for me right now.

839
00:45:47,760 --> 00:45:49,888
Just understand I'm Mr.
Head Honcho in charge here

840
00:45:49,890 --> 00:45:50,840
for the time being.

841
00:45:51,900 --> 00:45:56,433
And as such, I'm here to let you know that

842
00:45:58,350 --> 00:46:00,873
they found Bender dead
by suicide in his house.

843
00:46:01,920 --> 00:46:03,720
Neighbor reported hearing a gunshot,

844
00:46:04,957 --> 00:46:07,203
and police went in and found his body.

845
00:46:10,140 --> 00:46:12,598
As shocked and as unprepared
as you are by this,

846
00:46:12,600 --> 00:46:15,718
that puts a cold chill down my spine.

847
00:46:15,720 --> 00:46:18,448
I need to know about every single case

848
00:46:18,450 --> 00:46:20,248
you guys got going on.

849
00:46:20,250 --> 00:46:21,328
So get your shit together,

850
00:46:21,330 --> 00:46:24,933
because I want reports on my
desk by the end of the day.

851
00:46:26,940 --> 00:46:28,040
We are gonna start...

852
00:46:30,060 --> 00:46:31,973
What's this stuff still
doing on the ground?

853
00:46:32,820 --> 00:46:34,893
Come on, people, we are not Congress.

854
00:46:35,730 --> 00:46:37,498
We are gonna start working with efficiency

855
00:46:37,500 --> 00:46:39,183
and common sense around here.

856
00:46:41,460 --> 00:46:44,428
Can someone please get
this where it belongs?

857
00:46:44,430 --> 00:46:46,888
And the rest of you start
working on those reports.

858
00:46:46,890 --> 00:46:48,873
You, come with me.

859
00:47:02,100 --> 00:47:02,950
- I'm sorry, sir.

860
00:47:07,553 --> 00:47:08,884
You all right?

861
00:47:08,886 --> 00:47:09,717
- Yeah.

862
00:47:09,719 --> 00:47:11,548
- You should know we checked
every inch of Bender's place,

863
00:47:11,550 --> 00:47:14,122
and he was long gone.

864
00:47:14,124 --> 00:47:14,955
- Yeah, I know.

865
00:47:14,957 --> 00:47:16,283
Looks like the guilt brought him back.

866
00:47:17,213 --> 00:47:19,288
- That doesn't make any sense.

867
00:47:19,290 --> 00:47:23,313
- Nothing does in this
corrupted-ass place, except for you.

868
00:47:25,350 --> 00:47:28,280
Look, I don't believe
this was a suicide either.

869
00:47:28,282 --> 00:47:31,468
And I am positive that the
autopsy's gonna confirm that.

870
00:47:31,470 --> 00:47:34,143
- So what was it, a distraction?

871
00:47:36,123 --> 00:47:38,488
- You know, when I read your reports,

872
00:47:38,490 --> 00:47:40,140
I just knew I was gonna like you.

873
00:47:40,980 --> 00:47:41,811
There's a lot you can tell

874
00:47:41,813 --> 00:47:43,370
about an agent from their reports.

875
00:47:44,930 --> 00:47:46,588
You know what I can tell about you?

876
00:47:46,590 --> 00:47:47,998
- No, what?

877
00:47:48,000 --> 00:47:49,050
- You're trustworthy.

878
00:47:50,550 --> 00:47:51,628
And you confirmed that again

879
00:47:51,630 --> 00:47:53,530
by figuring all this out about Bender.

880
00:47:54,750 --> 00:47:58,888
- Well, thank you, but I
can't take all the credit.

881
00:47:58,890 --> 00:48:00,658
He kind of revealed himself.

882
00:48:00,660 --> 00:48:02,878
- Look, I assume that you know that

883
00:48:02,880 --> 00:48:04,443
the hitman is back in the city.

884
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:06,113
- Allegedly.

885
00:48:07,470 --> 00:48:08,303
- Right.

886
00:48:10,830 --> 00:48:12,418
So do you happen to have any clue

887
00:48:12,420 --> 00:48:15,369
where he allegedly might be?

888
00:48:15,371 --> 00:48:17,283
- No, no.

889
00:48:18,150 --> 00:48:19,113
I wish I did.

890
00:48:20,610 --> 00:48:21,443
- As do I.

891
00:48:24,331 --> 00:48:25,164
As do I.

892
00:48:58,801 --> 00:49:01,138
- Looks like the VPs are
trying to test our patience.

893
00:49:01,140 --> 00:49:04,348
They've been popping up in
seven of our territories.

894
00:49:04,350 --> 00:49:06,509
- Why ain't we taking off?

895
00:49:06,511 --> 00:49:08,718
- That was it, we already tried that.

896
00:49:08,720 --> 00:49:11,488
In my opinion, we're
still in recovery mode.

897
00:49:11,490 --> 00:49:12,504
I think it's better-

898
00:49:12,506 --> 00:49:14,075
- You've gotta be fucking
kidding me, right?

899
00:49:14,077 --> 00:49:16,183
"In my opinion, I think..."

900
00:49:17,400 --> 00:49:18,783
This that bullshit.

901
00:49:19,650 --> 00:49:21,028
This little nigga can't even come through

902
00:49:21,030 --> 00:49:22,263
with his mind made up.

903
00:49:23,940 --> 00:49:25,091
Bone, you should be the one-

904
00:49:25,093 --> 00:49:28,438
- I'm just a man waiting
on orders like you.

905
00:49:28,440 --> 00:49:29,777
- From a kid?

906
00:49:29,779 --> 00:49:31,179
- You can talk to me, nigga.

907
00:49:32,610 --> 00:49:35,257
- And what you gonna do with
that besides make me mad?

908

♪ I can't entertain you
niggers, I'll be too busy ♪

909
00:49:37,809 --> 00:49:39,039

Nothing, like I thought.

911
00:49:40,830 --> 00:49:41,927
Now put that little shit down

912
00:49:41,929 --> 00:49:45,479

your weak-ass orders.

No time for hesitation.

- Um...

931
00:50:46,515 --> 00:50:48,371
- Man, come on, stop playing.

932
00:50:48,373 --> 00:50:49,204
- What?

933
00:50:49,206 --> 00:50:50,037
What do you mean?

934
00:50:50,039 --> 00:50:52,228
- 'Cause I was gonna beg you
to make a choice like usual,

935
00:50:52,230 --> 00:50:54,598
just so we can end up
eating at Sherman Phoenix.

936
00:50:54,600 --> 00:50:56,861
- Because I like Sherman Phoenix.

937
00:50:56,863 --> 00:51:00,670
- I do too, but maybe we
just switch it up a little.

938
00:51:00,672 --> 00:51:01,678
- Okay.

939
00:51:01,680 --> 00:51:03,598
Well, let's switch it up, then.

940
00:51:03,600 --> 00:51:05,008
- We're going to Sherman Phoenix?

941
00:51:05,010 --> 00:51:07,343
- Yes.

942
00:51:11,611 --> 00:51:13,430
What happened to your hand?

943
00:51:13,432 --> 00:51:14,673
- I got angry.

944
00:51:16,080 --> 00:51:18,988
- And who was on the
other side of that anger?

945
00:51:18,990 --> 00:51:21,173
- Someone that just kept
running their mouth.

946
00:51:23,610 --> 00:51:24,778
I tried to keep it cool.

947
00:51:24,780 --> 00:51:26,278
- But you didn't.

948
00:51:26,280 --> 00:51:27,778
Tyler, if you keep on
going down this road,

949
00:51:27,780 --> 00:51:30,328
it's gonna change you for the worst.

950
00:51:30,330 --> 00:51:31,830
- What if I'm already changed?

951
00:51:33,574 --> 00:51:35,973
When I got shot, I went down as one man.

952
00:51:38,070 --> 00:51:42,298
But when I'm with you,
I feel myself again.

953
00:51:42,300 --> 00:51:43,498
I feel good.

954
00:51:43,500 --> 00:51:45,973
- So what happens when you're not with me?

955
00:51:48,450 --> 00:51:52,378
You know, for the longest
time, I dreamt of the day

956
00:51:52,380 --> 00:51:56,128
that you will wake up and see
the stupidity of all of this.

957
00:51:56,130 --> 00:51:58,708
But then we thought
that you was gonna die.

958
00:51:58,710 --> 00:51:59,541
You know, I just...

959
00:51:59,543 --> 00:52:00,693
I felt like I failed you.

960
00:52:01,591 --> 00:52:03,838
Then you made it through,

961
00:52:03,840 --> 00:52:04,918
and I just felt like

962
00:52:04,920 --> 00:52:07,678
I should have just told
you all my worries.

963
00:52:07,680 --> 00:52:09,028
You know, I wish that you would see

964
00:52:09,030 --> 00:52:11,493
the chance that God gave
you to leave this life.

965
00:52:14,391 --> 00:52:16,078
- I can't just leave.

966
00:52:16,080 --> 00:52:18,418
- Yes, you can, Tyler.

967
00:52:18,420 --> 00:52:19,713
It's destroying you.

968
00:52:20,550 --> 00:52:22,254
Don't you see that?

969
00:52:38,910 --> 00:52:39,993
- Long work day?

970
00:52:42,180 --> 00:52:43,013
- Was it you?

971
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,408
- Was what me?

972
00:52:45,410 --> 00:52:47,308
- We had a plan.

973
00:52:47,310 --> 00:52:48,988
All we had to do was wait
for the right moment.

974
00:52:48,990 --> 00:52:50,043
Why?

975
00:52:50,045 --> 00:52:51,088
- What are you talking about?

976
00:52:51,090 --> 00:52:52,858
- Stop playing dumb, okay?

977
00:52:52,860 --> 00:52:55,023
I put my career on the line for this plan.

978
00:52:56,850 --> 00:52:58,190
If they find out...

979
00:52:59,160 --> 00:53:00,333
Why'd you kill Bender?

980
00:53:07,320 --> 00:53:08,153
It wasn't you.

981
00:53:11,910 --> 00:53:12,743
Then who?

982
00:53:16,080 --> 00:53:18,808
- Somebody powerful who probably still

983
00:53:18,810 --> 00:53:20,433
has the hard drive right now,

984
00:53:21,840 --> 00:53:23,540
if they didn't destroy it already.

985
00:53:24,690 --> 00:53:25,590
- Who could it be?

986
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:29,820
- How far did you take Bender at his word?

987
00:53:30,990 --> 00:53:31,823
- Now?

988
00:53:32,910 --> 00:53:34,410
Not as far as I can throw him.

989
00:53:37,113 --> 00:53:38,938
- We have no other leads.

990
00:53:38,940 --> 00:53:39,773
- Bone.

991
00:53:43,560 --> 00:53:44,391
- I'll look into it.

992
00:53:44,393 --> 00:53:46,113
- Well, you better pray he has it.

993
00:53:53,100 --> 00:53:58,100
Oh, and Dimitri, don't you
ever come into my home again.

994
00:54:05,763 --> 00:54:06,596
Oh my God.

995
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,798
You want me to what?

996
00:54:10,800 --> 00:54:12,958
- Just let it sink in, okay?

997
00:54:12,960 --> 00:54:15,310
You don't have to make
any decisions right now.

998
00:54:17,184 --> 00:54:18,658
- Well, what about you?

999
00:54:18,660 --> 00:54:20,098
- Me?

1000
00:54:20,100 --> 00:54:24,208
No, my time here is not permanent.

1001
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,658
I'm more of a stepping stone.

1002
00:54:27,660 --> 00:54:28,988
- Oh.

1003
00:54:28,990 --> 00:54:30,418
- An exampled standard of what

1004
00:54:30,420 --> 00:54:32,613
the new head honcho oughta be.

1005
00:54:34,190 --> 00:54:36,518
- And you want that to be me?

1006
00:54:36,520 --> 00:54:37,918
- Mm-hmm.

1007
00:54:37,920 --> 00:54:39,268
- Sir, there are other agents

1008
00:54:39,270 --> 00:54:40,101
that have been here longer than me,

1009
00:54:40,103 --> 00:54:42,328
and I'm not qualified.

1010
00:54:42,330 --> 00:54:44,338
- Oh, gimme a break.

1011
00:54:44,340 --> 00:54:47,488
Qualifications are just
words on a piece of paper.

1012
00:54:47,490 --> 00:54:49,588
You've seen more in the last
year than half these agents

1013
00:54:49,590 --> 00:54:51,543
are gonna do in their entire careers.

1014
00:54:52,770 --> 00:54:54,670
Now, you need to understand something.

1015
00:54:55,573 --> 00:54:58,323
You got the attention of all
the right guys at the top,

1016
00:54:59,430 --> 00:55:01,618
and they think you can do this.

1017
00:55:01,620 --> 00:55:04,533
And more importantly, they can trust you.

1018
00:55:07,830 --> 00:55:12,511
- Sir, how do I lead people
that don't respect me

1019
00:55:12,513 --> 00:55:14,673
and, to be honest, I don't trust?

1020
00:55:16,404 --> 00:55:19,053
- Yeah, that is an unfortunate
occupational hazard,

1021
00:55:20,190 --> 00:55:22,378
especially in your case.

1022
00:55:22,380 --> 00:55:24,208
Look, all I'm asking you
to do is think about it.

1023
00:55:24,210 --> 00:55:26,523
There's no rush, okay?

1024
00:55:43,080 --> 00:55:46,045
- I know we in recovery
mode and all that shit,

1025
00:55:46,047 --> 00:55:48,153
but we could be making bigger moves.

1026
00:55:52,440 --> 00:55:54,778
Tyler my dude, but we need to be loyal

- Why'd you say that?

1031
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:08,188
- I'm saying that 'cause he
ain't built for this shit,

1032
00:56:08,190 --> 00:56:10,018
not for no shot-calling.

but shit, we gonna handle
his understandable mistake

1035
00:56:17,730 --> 00:56:20,583

- Man, what are you doing?

1067
00:57:44,400 --> 00:57:49,400
- Well, unfortunately, your OG here

1068
00:57:49,770 --> 00:57:51,753
just happens to be a fucking snake.

1069
00:57:53,610 --> 00:57:55,378
We've been tracking his movements

1070
00:57:55,380 --> 00:57:56,968
and come to find out

1071
00:57:56,970 --> 00:57:58,738
he been sneaking behind our backs,

1072
00:57:58,740 --> 00:58:00,393
killing our fucking people.

1073
00:58:04,710 --> 00:58:05,541
- So now what?

1074
00:58:05,543 --> 00:58:06,520
You kill the killer?

1075
00:58:07,680 --> 00:58:08,583
- No, you will.

1076
00:58:14,430 --> 00:58:15,263
- Why?

1077
00:58:16,140 --> 00:58:18,123
- I can appreciate your hesitancy,

1078
00:58:19,140 --> 00:58:21,508
but this nigger's full of envy,

1079
00:58:21,510 --> 00:58:22,341
and there ain't no room

1080
00:58:22,343 --> 00:58:24,748
for no motherfucker like
that in this organization.

1081
00:58:24,750 --> 00:58:25,833
He got to go.

1082
00:58:28,320 --> 00:58:30,320
He been plotting on you this whole time,

1083
00:58:31,538 --> 00:58:32,613
and you fell for it.

1084
00:58:34,560 --> 00:58:37,468
Good thing word got
back to me when it did.

1085
00:58:37,470 --> 00:58:38,570
Ain't that right, Jay?

1086
00:58:49,260 --> 00:58:50,248
- Gimme a reason why I shouldn't

1087
00:58:50,250 --> 00:58:52,100
blow your brains all over this floor.

1088
00:58:53,880 --> 00:58:55,473
- Nigger, you weak.

1089
00:58:57,150 --> 00:58:58,888
You don't know shit.

1090
00:58:58,890 --> 00:59:00,303
I know it and they know it.

1091
00:59:01,183 --> 00:59:03,788
I wouldn't give a fuck if
you was my mama, nigger.

1092
00:59:15,060 --> 00:59:18,963
- Listen, I know that was hard to do,

1093
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:21,873
but it was very necessary.

1094
00:59:27,540 --> 00:59:28,923
Now it's time to celebrate.

1095
00:59:32,550 --> 00:59:35,836
- Man, I think I need to go.

1096
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:39,918
- You need to go?

1097
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:42,903
Listen, I don't have the time for that.

1098
00:59:44,259 --> 00:59:45,859
You just killed one of your own,

1099
00:59:47,330 --> 00:59:49,030
and you did it for a valid reason.

1100
00:59:50,400 --> 00:59:53,728
You can't be showing no weakness,
I keep telling you that.

1101
00:59:53,730 --> 00:59:55,108
You keep doing that shit,

1102
00:59:55,110 --> 00:59:57,967
nobody's gonna listen to you, right?

1103
01:00:10,588 --> 01:00:13,088
Be able to grab the first one,

1104
01:00:14,274 --> 01:00:16,078
and you know, you take me over there,

1105
01:00:16,080 --> 01:00:17,836
I can handle that shit, nigga.

1106
01:00:17,838 --> 01:00:18,702
You know what I'm saying?

1107
01:00:18,704 --> 01:00:19,871
- Bone.
- Yeah.

1108
01:00:21,053 --> 01:00:22,653
- Why you had me do that, man?

1109
01:00:28,080 --> 01:00:29,163
This isn't the game.

1110
01:00:31,500 --> 01:00:32,583
This is death.

1111
01:00:36,510 --> 01:00:37,528
- This the part of the game

1112
01:00:37,530 --> 01:00:39,230
you need to understand, young dog.

1113
01:00:41,325 --> 01:00:42,156
You see, it ain't all about

1114
01:00:42,158 --> 01:00:43,258
fucking bitches and getting money.

1115
01:00:43,260 --> 01:00:45,118
You know that, right?

1116
01:00:45,120 --> 01:00:46,220
It's deeper than that.

1117
01:00:47,220 --> 01:00:48,393
All this shit we got?

1118
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:51,298
Blood, sweat, and tears,

1119
01:00:51,300 --> 01:00:52,948
hustling on them corners,

1120
01:00:52,950 --> 01:00:54,423
well before you came along.

1121
01:00:57,060 --> 01:00:58,801
What you need to understand is

1122
01:00:58,803 --> 01:01:01,503
this shit requires you to
know how to move pawns.

1123
01:01:02,880 --> 01:01:04,080
And when you learn that,

1124
01:01:05,404 --> 01:01:06,704
then you can do this shit.

1125
01:01:07,740 --> 01:01:09,286
- A pawn?

1126
01:01:09,288 --> 01:01:10,621
That's all I am?

1127
01:01:12,660 --> 01:01:17,660
- Listen, no one lives
forever, not even me.

1128
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:21,418
As much as I would like to think that,

1129
01:01:21,420 --> 01:01:22,683
it's just not realistic.

1130
01:01:24,330 --> 01:01:28,798
You know, when I think back
on when me and you first met,

1131
01:01:28,800 --> 01:01:30,898
I seen you breaking niggas,

1132
01:01:30,900 --> 01:01:32,491
the fearlessness you had in you,

1133
01:01:32,493 --> 01:01:34,533
that shit reminded me of myself.

1134
01:01:35,549 --> 01:01:39,748
Then, when you got shot, and
I seen you in the hospital,

1135
01:01:39,750 --> 01:01:43,113
it reminded me of every young
nigger that ever came along.

1136
01:01:44,160 --> 01:01:46,310
But one thing about
you that was different,

1137
01:01:47,970 --> 01:01:49,023
you was a fighter.

1138
01:01:50,220 --> 01:01:53,308
And that's when I knew you
had to carry this shit on.

1139
01:01:53,310 --> 01:01:54,748
- Carry what on?

1140
01:01:54,750 --> 01:01:55,858
- The balance.

1141
01:01:55,860 --> 01:01:58,618
You can't see it, but it's like gravity.

1142
01:01:58,620 --> 01:02:00,448
It's necessary.

1143
01:02:00,450 --> 01:02:01,438
You need to let me show you

1144
01:02:01,440 --> 01:02:04,378
what's behind these curtains,
man, 'cause I believe in you,

1145
01:02:04,380 --> 01:02:06,280
just like I told you in the beginning.

1146
01:02:07,860 --> 01:02:10,560
That's what's gonna move us
through this whole ordeal.

1147
01:02:13,590 --> 01:02:14,421
- I want peace.

1148
01:02:14,423 --> 01:02:15,843
- Nigga, fuck peace.

1149
01:02:16,860 --> 01:02:20,068
You think greatness is
attained in times of peace?

1150
01:02:20,070 --> 01:02:20,973
It's not.

1151
01:02:23,070 --> 01:02:26,523
The shit you did in that
basement was required.

1152
01:02:28,260 --> 01:02:29,370
Get that in your head.

1153
01:02:32,070 --> 01:02:34,048
That's what you gotta understand,

1154
01:02:34,050 --> 01:02:35,800
that ain't gonna be the first time.

1155
01:02:37,830 --> 01:02:40,887
But if you let me show
you, we gonna be all right.

1156
01:02:45,240 --> 01:02:46,113
- So now what?

1157
01:02:48,690 --> 01:02:49,773
- You locked in now.

1158
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:52,850
Ain't no getting out,
this shit is forever.

1159
01:02:54,780 --> 01:02:55,613
Wanna drink?

1160
01:03:13,650 --> 01:03:14,483
- Your gun.

1161
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:25,010
Where's the hard drive?

1162
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:27,974
- Hard drive?

1163
01:03:27,976 --> 01:03:30,693
I don't own a hard drive.

1164
01:03:32,070 --> 01:03:33,393
Dimitri Foster, right?

1165
01:03:34,830 --> 01:03:36,543
- Drive, now.

1166
01:03:38,310 --> 01:03:39,673
- Let's go inside and talk about this.

1167
01:03:39,675 --> 01:03:40,508
- Drive.

1168
01:03:55,620 --> 01:03:57,910
- So this is where you kill me?

1169
01:03:57,912 --> 01:03:59,248
A raggedly-ass warehouse?

1170
01:03:59,250 --> 01:04:00,748
- Where is it?

1171
01:04:00,750 --> 01:04:01,888
- Where's what?

1172
01:04:01,890 --> 01:04:03,388
- Don't play stupid.

1173
01:04:03,390 --> 01:04:05,818
Bender been working for
you the entire time.

1174
01:04:05,820 --> 01:04:07,288
- Bender?

1175
01:04:07,290 --> 01:04:08,613
The FBI agent?

1176
01:04:09,750 --> 01:04:12,538
- Why so desperate to
hide behind the curtains?

1177
01:04:12,540 --> 01:04:14,458
- Why are we at a warehouse near the dump?

1178
01:04:14,460 --> 01:04:16,863
- I know you run this city.

1179
01:04:17,940 --> 01:04:19,288
- Man, I don't know where the fuck

1180
01:04:19,290 --> 01:04:20,608
you getting your information from.

1181
01:04:20,610 --> 01:04:22,828
I'm just a man picking up the pieces.

1182
01:04:22,830 --> 01:04:23,663
- Get out.

1183
01:04:32,430 --> 01:04:34,378
You can make this painless.

1184
01:04:34,380 --> 01:04:36,741
Just tell me where it is.

1185
01:04:36,743 --> 01:04:38,338
- You kill me, you'll never find it.

1186
01:04:38,340 --> 01:04:39,873
- I thought you had no clue.

1187
01:04:40,950 --> 01:04:44,548
- Look at you, a man full of threats.

1188
01:04:44,550 --> 01:04:45,603
I will admit, though,

1189
01:04:46,530 --> 01:04:48,538
your follow-through game is impeccable.

1190
01:04:48,540 --> 01:04:50,793
- Then you know not to make me ask again.

1191
01:04:52,170 --> 01:04:54,748
- Before we proceed with the dramatics,

1192
01:04:54,750 --> 01:04:56,673
I would like to ask you one question.

1193
01:04:58,667 --> 01:04:59,848
When will all this shit break you?

1194
01:04:59,850 --> 01:05:02,128
- I could ask you the same thing.

1195
01:05:02,130 --> 01:05:03,418
- Nah, bruh.

1196
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,253
We different.

1197
01:05:05,640 --> 01:05:08,848
When I look at you, all
I see is desperation.

1198
01:05:08,850 --> 01:05:10,138
It's all in your eyes.

1199
01:05:10,140 --> 01:05:10,973
Pain,

1200
01:05:12,480 --> 01:05:13,313
death,

1201
01:05:14,340 --> 01:05:16,648
taking lives everywhere you go,

1202
01:05:16,650 --> 01:05:18,063
even the ones you love.

1203
01:05:19,230 --> 01:05:20,973
Yeah, Bender told me everything.

1204
01:05:22,350 --> 01:05:23,793
You were the perfect hire.

1205
01:05:24,690 --> 01:05:27,933
To me, I didn't give two fucks.

1206
01:05:29,190 --> 01:05:31,798
I'm gonna tell you just
like I tell everybody else.

1207
01:05:31,800 --> 01:05:34,558
Fall in line and get
the fuck outta my way.

1208
01:05:34,560 --> 01:05:36,453
- Not just picking up the pieces.

1209
01:05:39,570 --> 01:05:40,403
- Maybe yours.

1210
01:05:57,587 --> 01:05:59,008
- Hey, this is Angie.

1211
01:05:59,010 --> 01:06:00,868
I'm sorry I couldn't get to your call,

1212
01:06:00,870 --> 01:06:02,428
but if you leave your name and message,

1213
01:06:02,430 --> 01:06:04,018
I'll get back at you soon.

1214
01:06:04,020 --> 01:06:04,853
Thank you.

1215
01:06:06,300 --> 01:06:07,798
- Hey, baby.

1216
01:06:07,800 --> 01:06:09,350
About the other day, I'm sorry.

1217
01:06:10,810 --> 01:06:13,018
You know, there's a
lot going on right now,

1218
01:06:13,020 --> 01:06:14,373
a lot of responsibility,

1219
01:06:15,486 --> 01:06:16,675
and I hope you understand that.

1220
01:06:16,677 --> 01:06:18,303
But even if you don't, I do.

1221
01:06:19,380 --> 01:06:22,237
But I'm about to be on the
way over there to talk to you.

1222
01:06:46,050 --> 01:06:48,276
- You gonna make me ask?

1223
01:06:48,278 --> 01:06:50,775
- I was set up.

1224
01:06:50,777 --> 01:06:52,263
- Do you need more time off?

1225
01:06:53,100 --> 01:06:53,933
- No.

1226
01:06:55,543 --> 01:06:56,460
I'm pissed.

1227
01:06:57,600 --> 01:06:59,488
Bender was right.

1228
01:06:59,490 --> 01:07:00,323
It's Bone.

1229
01:07:01,650 --> 01:07:03,183
And he has the hard drive.

1230
01:07:04,570 --> 01:07:05,401
- How did you know?

1231
01:07:05,403 --> 01:07:06,958
Did he show you?

1232
01:07:06,960 --> 01:07:08,797
Did you see it?

1233
01:07:08,799 --> 01:07:10,182
- I know it.

1234
01:07:10,184 --> 01:07:11,495
- We cannot afford to go
off your guesses right now.

1235
01:07:11,497 --> 01:07:14,321
- I've been following his crew around.

1236
01:07:14,323 --> 01:07:16,558
I think I know where he's keeping it.

1237
01:07:16,560 --> 01:07:17,553
And if I'm right,

1238
01:07:18,990 --> 01:07:22,683
I think there's a way we can
kill two birds with one stone.

1239
01:07:41,806 --> 01:07:43,408
- Since when'd I tell you
to start sitting down?

1240
01:07:43,410 --> 01:07:44,848
- We got a new boss.

1241
01:07:44,850 --> 01:07:46,591
Asshole's cracking down on everybody.

1242
01:07:46,593 --> 01:07:48,907
- Man, that sounds like a you problem.

1243
01:08:00,930 --> 01:08:02,398
- It's kinda light.

1244
01:08:02,400 --> 01:08:03,692
They won't like that.

1245
01:08:03,694 --> 01:08:05,968
- Yeah, that hard drive from Bender,

1246
01:08:05,970 --> 01:08:07,020
I'll be keeping that,

1247
01:08:07,920 --> 01:08:09,808
which means I'm gonna be
giving you and your friends

1248
01:08:09,810 --> 01:08:11,510
what I wanna give you from now on.

1249
01:08:12,746 --> 01:08:14,728
Get the fuck outta my face.

1250
01:08:46,920 --> 01:08:49,077
- There was a list, a long one.

1251
01:08:52,200 --> 01:08:53,523
All your names are on it.

1252
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:03,573
- Bone, cuz, may I ask you a question?

1253
01:09:05,940 --> 01:09:08,523
Who was in charge when
all of this shit happened?

1254
01:09:09,630 --> 01:09:10,948
- Dog, you forgot what we said

1255
01:09:10,950 --> 01:09:12,900
when we first started this whole thing?

1256
01:09:14,003 --> 01:09:15,641
I was gonna play the back,

1257
01:09:15,643 --> 01:09:16,631
you was gonna play the front.

1258
01:09:16,633 --> 01:09:17,464
- Right, right, right.
- What happened

1259
01:09:17,466 --> 01:09:18,297
with all of that?

1260
01:09:18,299 --> 01:09:21,335
- So where's the man of
the hour, huh?

1261
01:09:21,337 --> 01:09:23,908
- Man, listen, I get it, man.

1262
01:09:23,910 --> 01:09:26,310
You took your shots, you
missed, and you pissed.

1263
01:09:27,360 --> 01:09:29,338
But we gonna get another chance.

1264
01:09:29,340 --> 01:09:31,228
Next time this lang stick his head out,

1265
01:09:31,230 --> 01:09:32,861
we gonna tear that motherfucker off.

1266
01:09:32,863 --> 01:09:35,043
- Was I ever really
calling the shots, bro?

1267
01:09:37,935 --> 01:09:40,690
- Dog, that's this shit talking.

1268
01:09:41,700 --> 01:09:43,588
Now it's Ty's time to shine.

1269
01:09:43,590 --> 01:09:44,458
- Oh.

1270
01:09:44,460 --> 01:09:47,578
- And hopefully, with our help,

1271
01:09:47,580 --> 01:09:49,780
he won't make the same
mistakes that we did.

1272
01:09:50,778 --> 01:09:51,838
- Right.

1273
01:09:51,840 --> 01:09:53,488
Right, right, right.

1274
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,080
So tell me, what's it?

1275
01:09:57,761 --> 01:09:58,953
Where's Egg?

1276
01:10:00,830 --> 01:10:02,553
Yeah, the hitman?

1277
01:10:03,420 --> 01:10:04,253
- Dimitri?

1278
01:10:05,646 --> 01:10:07,722
I don't know.

1279
01:10:07,724 --> 01:10:08,578
- What's he looking for, man?

1280
01:10:08,580 --> 01:10:09,736
- I don't know.

1281
01:10:09,738 --> 01:10:11,518
- Mm.

1282
01:10:11,520 --> 01:10:12,958
Are you sure?

1283
01:10:12,960 --> 01:10:13,791
- I'm positive.

1284
01:10:13,793 --> 01:10:17,050
Why would I call you in if I
had something to hide, man?

1285
01:10:17,052 --> 01:10:18,088
- Right.

1286
01:10:18,090 --> 01:10:20,609
- What's up with all
the 21 Questions, cuz?

1287
01:10:20,611 --> 01:10:22,467
- Hey, man.

1288
01:10:22,469 --> 01:10:23,837
♪ Girl, that nigga ain't shit ♪

1289
01:10:23,839 --> 01:10:24,868
♪ It ain't my kind ♪

1290
01:10:24,870 --> 01:10:28,948
- Dog, everything gonna be cool, man.

1291
01:10:28,950 --> 01:10:31,258
I just need T.A. to get back to T.A.

1292
01:10:31,260 --> 01:10:33,960
- How the fuck am I supposed
to get back to T.A., huh?

1293
01:10:35,070 --> 01:10:38,120
Knowing that this nigger
here is out here, huh?

1294
01:10:39,230 --> 01:10:42,093
- So you telling me you
worried about this clown?

1295
01:10:43,770 --> 01:10:46,620
Since when we worried about
motherfuckers like that, man?

1296
01:10:47,994 --> 01:10:51,436
Huh?

1297
01:10:51,438 --> 01:10:53,308
- Yeah, all right.
- Come on, baby.

1298
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:54,590
Come on.

1299
01:10:54,592 --> 01:10:55,486
♪ You just another guy ♪

1300
01:10:55,488 --> 01:11:00,255

- Baby.

1302
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,133
Angela.

1303
01:11:27,240 --> 01:11:30,048
- Tyler, you in too deep,

1304
01:11:30,050 --> 01:11:32,788
and I won't be a part of it.

1305
01:11:32,790 --> 01:11:33,623
I'm gone.

1306
01:11:34,484 --> 01:11:36,328
And don't come looking for me.

1307
01:11:36,330 --> 01:11:37,233
Angela.

1308
01:11:45,600 --> 01:11:47,300
- Damn, I hope they left this key.

1309
01:12:06,033 --> 01:12:07,558
- Man, what are you doing?

1310
01:12:07,560 --> 01:12:08,391
- Ty, man, I was just-

1311
01:12:08,393 --> 01:12:10,168
- We made the streets safe for you again.

1312
01:12:10,170 --> 01:12:11,998
We brought you back into our home.

1313
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,260
- Man, I ain't asked for shit.

1314
01:12:13,262 --> 01:12:15,075
- Nigga, you ain't have to.

1315
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:17,155
Now you sneak around like a little bitch.

1316
01:12:17,157 --> 01:12:19,707
- Oh, you feeling yourself, huh?

1317
01:12:19,709 --> 01:12:20,914
Man, there's a lot of shit going on

1318
01:12:20,916 --> 01:12:22,918
that you don't know nothing about.

1319
01:12:22,920 --> 01:12:24,970
Bone been-
- Bone's not in charge, I am.

1320
01:12:25,920 --> 01:12:27,298
- Wow.

1321
01:12:27,300 --> 01:12:28,948
Well, let me tell you something, nigga,

1322
01:12:28,950 --> 01:12:32,308
you killed a whole fucking
federal agent, and not in jail.

1323
01:12:32,310 --> 01:12:34,528
How the fuck do you think that happened?

1324
01:12:34,530 --> 01:12:35,638
Bone been playing us, nigga.

1325
01:12:35,640 --> 01:12:37,173
Get your shit together.

1326
01:12:38,310 --> 01:12:40,198
- Couldn't wait a second to
make your move, could you?

1327
01:12:40,200 --> 01:12:41,327
- Nigga, fuck you.

1328
01:12:44,252 --> 01:12:45,568
- Oh shit.

1329
01:12:45,570 --> 01:12:47,158
- How the fuck do you
think you and Keyshawn

1330
01:12:47,160 --> 01:12:49,160
kept slipping through the feds' fingers?

1331
01:12:50,340 --> 01:12:51,213
Luck, nigga?

1332
01:12:53,400 --> 01:12:55,318
And how do you reward me?

1333
01:12:55,320 --> 01:12:57,865
By outsourcing guns and drugs.

1334
01:12:57,867 --> 01:12:59,229
- Nigga, we was trying to come up.

1335
01:12:59,231 --> 01:13:01,529
- No, you got cocky, nigga.

1336
01:13:01,531 --> 01:13:03,395
Think I wasn't gonna find out.

1337
01:13:03,397 --> 01:13:05,608
I gave you all the game you got,

1338
01:13:05,610 --> 01:13:07,829
and that's how you repay me, cuz?

1339
01:13:13,290 --> 01:13:14,890
It was me that killed the bitch.

1340
01:13:22,650 --> 01:13:24,123
You forgot the rules, nigga.

1341
01:13:27,810 --> 01:13:29,248
- Your own cousin?

1342
01:13:29,250 --> 01:13:30,083
- That's right.

1343
01:13:32,130 --> 01:13:33,123
You slipping, man.

1344
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:03,601
- The hard drive.

1345
01:14:24,211 --> 01:14:25,798
- Don't you play dumb with me.

1346
01:14:25,800 --> 01:14:26,938
- I'm working on a case.

1347
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:28,468
- A case I should have
been informed about.

1348
01:14:28,470 --> 01:14:30,070
- I have to keep this to myself.

1349
01:14:32,148 --> 01:14:33,333
- Really?

1350
01:14:34,410 --> 01:14:36,958
You know, you're not sitting
in this chair just yet,

1351
01:14:36,960 --> 01:14:40,198
and you are seriously risking
the opportunity to do so.

1352
01:14:40,200 --> 01:14:42,528
So you either bring me up
to speed on what's going on,

1353
01:14:42,530 --> 01:14:43,858
or you put your badge and your gun

1354
01:14:43,860 --> 01:14:45,807
on this desk and you leave.

1355
01:14:46,644 --> 01:14:47,998
You can't trust us,

1356
01:14:48,000 --> 01:14:48,950
we can't trust you.

1357
01:14:55,620 --> 01:14:56,518
- Man, what?

1358
01:14:56,520 --> 01:14:58,448
- What you mean, "What?"

1359
01:14:58,450 --> 01:15:00,843
What, you best friends with the feds now?

1360
01:15:03,840 --> 01:15:08,518
Look man, I'm having a real
hard time not killing your ass.

1361
01:15:08,520 --> 01:15:10,174
- I know.

1362
01:15:12,990 --> 01:15:14,611
This her.

1363
01:15:14,613 --> 01:15:16,708
- Man, I'm not working
with the fucking feds.

1364
01:15:16,710 --> 01:15:19,408
It's the lot that got me into
this mess in the first place.

1365
01:15:19,410 --> 01:15:21,928
- Well, good, 'cause I'm
not one anymore anyway.

1366
01:15:21,930 --> 01:15:23,580
- Fuck outta here.
- Wait, what?

1367
01:15:24,654 --> 01:15:25,888
- It doesn't matter.

1368
01:15:25,890 --> 01:15:27,028
What does, is this evidence.

1369
01:15:27,030 --> 01:15:28,798
We need to finish this.

1370
01:15:28,800 --> 01:15:29,631
- We?

1371
01:15:29,633 --> 01:15:30,464
- Yeah.

1372
01:15:30,466 --> 01:15:31,918
- But I just outed Bone.

1373
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:33,870
I'm not going down with these-
- Stop.

1374
01:15:35,430 --> 01:15:36,830
He took everything from you.

1375
01:15:37,710 --> 01:15:39,628
Why not take everything from him?

1376
01:15:39,630 --> 01:15:41,065
- And then what?

1377
01:15:41,067 --> 01:15:43,170
Can we even take that shit to the feds?

1378
01:15:44,760 --> 01:15:46,768
- To be honest, I don't trust them either.

1379
01:15:46,770 --> 01:15:49,018
- Oh fuck, man.

1380
01:15:49,020 --> 01:15:50,548
- Maybe the guy that doesn't trust anyone

1381
01:15:50,550 --> 01:15:51,750
is the one we can trust.

1382
01:15:54,330 --> 01:15:56,096
- Man, y'all figure this shit out.

1383
01:16:00,840 --> 01:16:02,368
- Are you ready to do your job?

1384
01:16:02,370 --> 01:16:04,948
- I told you to only call me
if you had something concrete.

1385
01:16:04,950 --> 01:16:07,623
- Okay, look, I'm working
with the hitman, all right?

1386
01:16:08,730 --> 01:16:09,873
- Are you insane?

1387
01:16:10,860 --> 01:16:12,460
- He helped me get the evidence.

1388
01:16:13,530 --> 01:16:16,228
- Blinded by your own
ambition, just like Bender.

1389
01:16:16,230 --> 01:16:18,088
- No, I'm nothing like Bender.

1390
01:16:18,090 --> 01:16:19,438
Can I trust you?

1391
01:16:19,440 --> 01:16:20,638
- Can you trust me?

1392
01:16:20,640 --> 01:16:21,581
You're the one who called me.

1393
01:16:21,583 --> 01:16:23,308
- Look, if I get you the evidence,

1394
01:16:23,310 --> 01:16:25,798
will you just do what needs to be done?

1395
01:16:25,800 --> 01:16:28,186
- Even if it means bringing you in.

1396
01:16:31,890 --> 01:16:33,208
When?

1397
01:16:33,210 --> 01:16:34,860
- Tomorrow, I'll text you a time.

1398
01:16:36,180 --> 01:16:37,013
- Where?

1399
01:16:38,633 --> 01:16:40,288
- You choose.

1400
01:16:40,290 --> 01:16:42,268
- You sound just like
my wife on date night.

1401
01:16:42,270 --> 01:16:44,368
Listen, I don't got time for this.

1402
01:16:44,370 --> 01:16:46,470

- Well, it has to be a spot he chose.

1441
01:18:21,150 --> 01:18:23,818
Dimitri, I need you to know,

1442
01:18:23,820 --> 01:18:26,188
when this is over and we take them down,

1443
01:18:26,190 --> 01:18:27,388
you have to go down too, okay?

1444
01:18:27,390 --> 01:18:28,528
You just...

1445
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,330
You've done too much-
- I hear you.

1446
01:18:31,839 --> 01:18:32,756
I hear you.

1447
01:19:02,520 --> 01:19:03,353
This him?

1448
01:19:04,422 --> 01:19:05,255
- Mm-hmm.

1449
01:19:09,413 --> 01:19:10,563
Are you okay?

1450
01:19:12,150 --> 01:19:13,769
- Sorry.

1451
01:19:13,771 --> 01:19:14,818
- What's going on?

1452
01:19:14,820 --> 01:19:15,897
What's wrong?

1453
01:19:15,899 --> 01:19:16,997
- They know where I live.

1454
01:19:16,999 --> 01:19:17,830
- Huh?

1455
01:19:17,832 --> 01:19:19,229
- My family's not safe.

1456
01:19:19,231 --> 01:19:21,209
Think I'm being followed.

1457
01:19:21,211 --> 01:19:23,098
- Who could be following you?
- Well, well, well.

1458
01:19:23,100 --> 01:19:24,028
I'll take that.

1459
01:19:24,030 --> 01:19:25,588
Party without me?

1460
01:19:25,590 --> 01:19:26,740
I have eyes everywhere.

1461
01:19:27,750 --> 01:19:29,068
- You're not leaving with that.

1462
01:19:29,070 --> 01:19:30,388
- Hell if I'm not.

1463
01:19:30,390 --> 01:19:31,923
You must be Agent Miraflores.

1464
01:19:32,844 --> 01:19:35,815
Look just the way they described
you, sexy and succulent.

1465
01:19:35,817 --> 01:19:37,443
How you doing, angry man?

1466
01:19:40,410 --> 01:19:41,943
Okay, let's get to business.

1467
01:19:42,900 --> 01:19:44,300
I'm here to extend an offer.

1468
01:19:45,210 --> 01:19:48,148
There's a lot of power and
determination at this table.

1469
01:19:48,150 --> 01:19:49,858
Why let it go to waste

1470
01:19:49,860 --> 01:19:52,528
when we can do such great
things for this city?

1471
01:19:52,530 --> 01:19:54,268
- Is that the same lie you told T.A.?

1472
01:19:54,270 --> 01:19:55,889
- You mean the traitor?

1473
01:20:00,630 --> 01:20:02,780
- Man, what the fuck
is wrong with you, Ty?

1474
01:20:08,010 --> 01:20:09,928
Yo, man, stop this shit.

1475
01:20:09,930 --> 01:20:11,463
I'm not fighting no more, dog.

1476
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,498
- You a bitch-ass nigga.

1477
01:20:16,500 --> 01:20:17,493
Always been one.

1478
01:20:18,510 --> 01:20:23,510
- Listen, officially, I
can get up from this table,

1479
01:20:23,940 --> 01:20:26,883
walk away, and make all y'all disappear.

1480
01:20:28,416 --> 01:20:29,878
But I can't.

1481
01:20:29,880 --> 01:20:33,915
Why would I do that when we
have such a great thing going?

1482
01:20:33,917 --> 01:20:36,568
- If you even think
you're leaving this table,

1483
01:20:36,570 --> 01:20:37,820
I will happily shoot you.

1484
01:20:47,760 --> 01:20:48,593
- Guns, please.

1485
01:20:56,730 --> 01:20:58,738
I have eyes everywhere.

1486
01:20:58,740 --> 01:20:59,740
- Get on your knees.

1487
01:21:01,690 --> 01:21:02,810
- Look, man...

1488
01:21:04,180 --> 01:21:05,578
All right, I'm sorry, man.

1489
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,580
Sorry I brought you into this shit, dog.

1490
01:21:08,645 --> 01:21:11,093
There ain't shit but pain
and misery with this shit.

1491
01:21:12,690 --> 01:21:14,668
- Truly the man in charge.

1492
01:21:14,670 --> 01:21:15,933
- That was Key and T.A.

1493
01:21:16,950 --> 01:21:19,798
I'm just cleaning up the mess y'all made.

1494
01:21:19,800 --> 01:21:21,358
- And now you about to make somebody else

1495
01:21:21,360 --> 01:21:22,660
the face of it all, right?

1496
01:21:24,330 --> 01:21:25,630
- You ain't gotta do this.

1497
01:21:34,110 --> 01:21:35,643
- Don't complicate things.

1498
01:21:36,600 --> 01:21:39,628
All you gotta do is tell
people what they wanna hear,

1499
01:21:39,630 --> 01:21:41,968
not what they need to hear.

1500
01:21:41,970 --> 01:21:42,995
- Hmm.

1501
01:21:44,940 --> 01:21:45,773
- Dimitri.

1502
01:21:47,610 --> 01:21:48,805
- He needs to die.

1503
01:21:48,807 --> 01:21:49,963
- And what about us?

1504
01:21:51,090 --> 01:21:53,248
- It's a sacrifice.

1505
01:21:53,250 --> 01:21:55,918
- It's not gonna make it better, okay?

1506
01:21:55,920 --> 01:21:57,958
No, look, it can't help anything,

1507
01:21:57,960 --> 01:22:00,136
'cause it's just gonna make it worse.

1508
01:22:00,138 --> 01:22:01,391
- You know what?

1509
01:22:01,393 --> 01:22:05,671
This whole room, everybody
in it, we need to die.

1510
01:22:05,673 --> 01:22:07,615
- Move in, move in, move in!

1511
01:22:07,617 --> 01:22:09,255
- Everybody, put your hands up!

1512
01:22:16,543 --> 01:22:18,717
- Put the gun down.

1513
01:22:18,719 --> 01:22:20,433
Put the gun down.

1514
01:22:20,435 --> 01:22:21,765
- I'm not going to jail.

1515
01:22:32,890 --> 01:22:33,723
- No!

1516
01:22:41,145 --> 01:22:45,241
- Everybody put your hands
up and drop your weapons.

1517
01:23:22,871 --> 01:23:24,341
Drop your weapon!

1518
01:23:28,290 --> 01:23:29,121
- What happened?

1519
01:23:29,123 --> 01:23:30,353
We could have worked together, hmm?

1520
01:23:31,590 --> 01:23:32,635
Pitiful.

1521
01:24:00,900 --> 01:24:03,808
- I still don't know how they
figured out where I live.

1522
01:24:03,810 --> 01:24:06,088
- Relax, as soon as we heard
about it, we sent people over.

1523
01:24:06,090 --> 01:24:07,738
Your family's safe.

1524
01:24:07,740 --> 01:24:08,578
- Thanks.

1525
01:24:08,580 --> 01:24:09,508
- Take his ass away.

1526
01:24:09,510 --> 01:24:10,743
He got a new home now.

1527
01:24:19,680 --> 01:24:22,498
I had a feeling Bone
would make a move on us,

1528
01:24:22,500 --> 01:24:24,568
just didn't know how or when.

1529
01:24:24,570 --> 01:24:26,518
You know, having evidence on him is great,

1530
01:24:26,520 --> 01:24:30,093
but catching him in the
act, oh, it's even greater.

1531
01:24:30,960 --> 01:24:32,566
- Yeah.

1532
01:24:32,568 --> 01:24:34,288
What I'm really trying to figure out is

1533
01:24:34,290 --> 01:24:37,318
how the fuck you get away
with that without a leak?

1534
01:24:37,320 --> 01:24:38,278
I guarantee you're gonna find

1535
01:24:38,280 --> 01:24:39,988
a couple of your homies on that drive.

1536
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:42,178
- Yeah, you're probably right.

1537
01:24:42,180 --> 01:24:44,548
Well, we only told the ones
that we thought we could trust,

1538
01:24:44,550 --> 01:24:46,048
and that wasn't a lot, you know?

1539
01:24:46,050 --> 01:24:47,518
The ones that would do the right thing.

1540
01:24:47,520 --> 01:24:50,073
It wasn't easy, but it worked.

1541
01:24:51,870 --> 01:24:53,878
Everyone will catch wind of this soon.

1542
01:24:53,880 --> 01:24:55,653
The rest, we'll get to 'em.

1543
01:24:58,020 --> 01:24:59,570
Looks like the rumors are true.

1544
01:25:00,900 --> 01:25:02,253
You worked with the feds.

1545
01:25:04,560 --> 01:25:05,393
- Now what?

1546
01:25:06,540 --> 01:25:09,603
- Well, the way I see
it, you got two choices.

1547
01:25:11,310 --> 01:25:14,073
One, you could run.

1548
01:25:15,120 --> 01:25:16,708
There's a lot of distractions going on,

1549
01:25:16,710 --> 01:25:18,010
and maybe you'll get away.

1550
01:25:19,470 --> 01:25:23,128
Or two, word on the street
is I'm due for a promotion,

1551
01:25:23,130 --> 01:25:26,638
so I could see to it, with
the best of my ability,

1552
01:25:26,640 --> 01:25:29,128
to seek immunity for all your help.

1553
01:25:29,130 --> 01:25:29,961
- Even with all the shit that I've done?

1554
01:25:29,963 --> 01:25:32,073
- I mean, I didn't say
it was gonna be easy.

1555
01:25:38,640 --> 01:25:40,358
- Look, I'm tired of running.

1556
01:25:55,012 --> 01:25:57,568
- Hmm, what's so funny?

1557
01:25:57,570 --> 01:25:58,738
- You proud of yourself?

1558
01:25:58,740 --> 01:26:00,148
- Yeah, actually, I am.

1559
01:26:00,150 --> 01:26:02,185
- You have no idea what you've done.

1560
01:26:02,187 --> 01:26:03,543
- And what might that be?

1561
01:26:04,740 --> 01:26:06,140
- Baby girl, you didn't win.

1562
01:26:07,350 --> 01:26:09,153
I kept balance to this shit.

1563
01:26:11,520 --> 01:26:14,308
You just exposed Milwaukee

1564
01:26:14,310 --> 01:26:17,043
to the most horrifying situation.

1565
01:26:18,330 --> 01:26:20,913
And believe me, they coming.

1566
01:26:21,841 --> 01:26:23,523
- Well, we'll be waiting for 'em.

1567
01:26:24,840 --> 01:26:25,840
Enjoy your new home.

1568
01:26:29,820 --> 01:26:30,653
