1
00:02:08,562 --> 00:02:11,030
Plutonium...

2
00:02:11,031 --> 00:02:14,467
The key ingredient to nuclear bombs.

3
00:02:14,468 --> 00:02:18,070
This plutonium was stolen,

4
00:02:18,071 --> 00:02:20,106
gram by deadly gram,

5
00:02:20,107 --> 00:02:23,236
from a German nuclear power plant.

6
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:36,522
My organization...

7
00:02:36,523 --> 00:02:39,091
The United Nations Anti-Crime
Organization...

8
00:02:39,092 --> 00:02:41,694
Responds to nuclear terrorism.

9
00:02:41,695 --> 00:02:45,431
So when Karl Leitzig, a German
physicist,

10
00:02:45,432 --> 00:02:47,466
used this stolen plutonium

11
00:02:47,467 --> 00:02:50,169
to construct two nuclear bombs,

12
00:02:50,170 --> 00:02:52,171
his creations became

13
00:02:52,172 --> 00:02:54,774
UNACO's nightmare.

14
00:02:54,775 --> 00:02:56,334
Dr. Leitzig's "gadgets,"

15
00:02:56,710 --> 00:02:58,411
as we call them,

16
00:02:58,412 --> 00:03:00,312
utilized components smuggled out

17
00:03:00,313 --> 00:03:02,348
of the former Soviet Union...

18
00:03:02,349 --> 00:03:04,617
Highly restricted components

19
00:03:04,618 --> 00:03:07,219
supplied by a renegade Russian
general

20
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:10,156
and assembled under his supervision

21
00:03:10,157 --> 00:03:12,991
with the utmost German
craftsmanship.

22
00:03:15,462 --> 00:03:17,196
You see, the Russian general

23
00:03:17,197 --> 00:03:18,731
needed two bombs

24
00:03:18,732 --> 00:03:21,300
to change the course of world events.

25
00:03:21,301 --> 00:03:24,470
And Dr. Leitzig needed a job.

26
00:03:24,471 --> 00:03:27,600
It was the ideal partnership, until...

27
00:03:37,784 --> 00:03:41,420
Benin... your Soviet garbage.

28
00:03:41,421 --> 00:03:43,617
I am irradiated!

29
00:03:45,325 --> 00:03:46,226
Your neutron gun...

30
00:03:46,227 --> 00:03:48,195
I was testing it and it ruptured!

31
00:03:57,771 --> 00:03:59,535
And the bomb?

32
00:04:03,310 --> 00:04:05,779
What about it?

33
00:04:15,889 --> 00:04:18,381
They're gonna pull a lot of overtime.

34
00:04:35,408 --> 00:04:36,933
Well?

35
00:04:39,246 --> 00:04:40,279
I can't release your car

36
00:04:40,280 --> 00:04:43,079
without agricultural inspection.

37
00:04:44,484 --> 00:04:46,043
Yo!

38
00:04:47,854 --> 00:04:49,622
Radio for clearance... now.

39
00:04:49,623 --> 00:04:52,559
Okay, let's go!

40
00:04:56,496 --> 00:04:58,264
Control...

41
00:04:58,265 --> 00:05:02,535
Track 18, engine 4402,

42
00:05:02,536 --> 00:05:04,232
ready for departure.

43
00:05:07,474 --> 00:05:09,306
Out, out!

44
00:05:10,377 --> 00:05:12,141
Get out!

45
00:05:13,280 --> 00:05:14,714
Get out. Out! Come on!

46
00:05:19,553 --> 00:05:21,852
Come on, sit down! Move it, sit!

47
00:05:40,040 --> 00:05:41,668
Now, move!

48
00:05:43,410 --> 00:05:45,345
Stop there!

49
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:49,774
Shut up!

50
00:05:57,924 --> 00:05:59,654
Nein! Nein!

51
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:05,766
Shut up or you're all dead! Shut it!

52
00:06:24,284 --> 00:06:25,718
Be careful.

53
00:07:49,269 --> 00:07:51,261
Whoo!

54
00:07:53,073 --> 00:07:54,073
There's only one kind

55
00:07:54,074 --> 00:07:55,542
of bunny rabbit I slow down for.

56
00:07:55,642 --> 00:07:57,343
Uh-huh.

57
00:07:57,344 --> 00:07:58,477
Would've gone for roadkill,

58
00:07:58,478 --> 00:08:01,243
but rabbit's not in season.

59
00:08:03,116 --> 00:08:04,846
You're buying.

60
00:08:13,893 --> 00:08:16,261
Okay, yes. Thank you.

61
00:08:16,262 --> 00:08:18,163
Hey.- Hey.

62
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:22,134
Anything shakin'?- No, nothing for
us.

63
00:08:22,135 --> 00:08:24,036
Mmm.- Did you hear about Philpott?

64
00:08:24,037 --> 00:08:25,528
No.

65
00:08:25,638 --> 00:08:27,940
Baa! Broke his wrist at lunch.

66
00:08:27,941 --> 00:08:30,467
Oh no!-Yep.

67
00:08:30,577 --> 00:08:32,102
You did it?

68
00:08:32,212 --> 00:08:36,013
No! Boxing at the Harlem Athletic Club.

69
00:08:38,351 --> 00:08:40,582
There's something for your evening.

70
00:08:49,229 --> 00:08:51,721
4402, track 18...

71
00:08:51,831 --> 00:08:53,866
Slow to upcoming siderail

72
00:08:53,867 --> 00:08:55,836
to allow northbound passing.

73
00:08:55,935 --> 00:08:59,238
Listen, this is 4402.

74
00:08:59,239 --> 00:09:01,640
We don't slow for anyone.

75
00:09:01,641 --> 00:09:03,509
I've got a dozen of your people

76
00:09:03,510 --> 00:09:04,710
and I want the tracks

77
00:09:04,711 --> 00:09:06,779
cleared to Stuttgart, got it?

78
00:09:06,780 --> 00:09:09,306
Who is this?-Your worst nightmare.

79
00:09:14,721 --> 00:09:16,522
Northbound 1507...

80
00:09:16,523 --> 00:09:18,492
Emergency... slow for spur.

81
00:09:21,795 --> 00:09:23,195
Slow for spur! I am

82
00:09:23,196 --> 00:09:24,824
switching you in 500 meters.

83
00:09:47,287 --> 00:09:48,812
We don't flinch.

84
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:50,857
Shit, Alex.

85
00:10:04,838 --> 00:10:05,806
Alex!

86
00:10:16,616 --> 00:10:18,244
That was close.

87
00:10:28,895 --> 00:10:30,229
They've just found

88
00:10:30,230 --> 00:10:31,198
two bodies in Bremen railyard.

89
00:10:33,433 --> 00:10:35,163
4402, what do you want?

90
00:10:37,770 --> 00:10:39,932
I want your complete attention,

91
00:10:40,039 --> 00:10:41,907
your undying cooperation

92
00:10:41,908 --> 00:10:42,941
and your first-born.

93
00:10:42,942 --> 00:10:46,538
And I want a clear route to Stuttgart,

94
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,342
or I start killing hostages.

95
00:10:48,448 --> 00:10:50,280
Do you understand me?

96
00:10:51,451 --> 00:10:54,216
The route's yours.
Thank you.

97
00:11:04,364 --> 00:11:07,300
Sabrina, hey, check this out.

98
00:11:12,305 --> 00:11:14,467
Bremen again.

99
00:11:15,675 --> 00:11:18,144
Two in a row in a sleepy town.

100
00:11:19,512 --> 00:11:21,879
Find out the train's cargo.

101
00:11:23,383 --> 00:11:25,113
Yes.

102
00:11:25,218 --> 00:11:26,552
Will you please inform

103
00:11:26,553 --> 00:11:27,646
your commander-in-chief

104
00:11:27,754 --> 00:11:28,787
that UNACO's

105
00:11:28,788 --> 00:11:29,756
broad range of power

106
00:11:29,856 --> 00:11:31,423
has been sanctioned by

107
00:11:31,424 --> 00:11:33,052
the United Nations General Assembly

108
00:11:33,159 --> 00:11:34,889
and the Security Council? And...

109
00:11:34,994 --> 00:11:36,995
No, just the freedom

110
00:11:36,996 --> 00:11:38,965
to run my own operations.

111
00:11:40,366 --> 00:11:42,699
Look, could I get back to you, please?

112
00:11:42,802 --> 00:11:46,371
Thank you so much. Goodbye.

113
00:11:46,372 --> 00:11:47,973
Diplomats.

114
00:11:47,974 --> 00:11:50,108
Wouldn't that imply diplomacy?

115
00:11:50,109 --> 00:11:52,277
Ours is a strange language, Sahib.

116
00:11:52,278 --> 00:11:54,947
You better see what's going on.

117
00:11:54,948 --> 00:11:57,115
I trust this is not another attempt

118
00:11:57,116 --> 00:11:59,518
to get yourself out in the field, Ms.
Carver?

119
00:11:59,519 --> 00:12:01,286
Actually, I was just on my way out.

120
00:12:01,287 --> 00:12:02,654
After that phone call,

121
00:12:02,655 --> 00:12:03,623
some of us may be joining you.

122
00:12:06,693 --> 00:12:08,060
The Germans have a hijacked train

123
00:12:08,061 --> 00:12:10,095
moving from Bremen to Stuttgart.

124
00:12:10,096 --> 00:12:12,064
And possibly unrelated,

125
00:12:12,065 --> 00:12:13,098
a plutonium theft nearby.

126
00:12:13,099 --> 00:12:14,099
12 hostages,

127
00:12:14,100 --> 00:12:17,102
two dead male employees.

128
00:12:17,103 --> 00:12:18,170
There's been radio communication

129
00:12:18,171 --> 00:12:19,538
with the hijackers.

130
00:12:19,539 --> 00:12:20,739
Let's request a tape recorder,

131
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,507
Ms. Sanchez. Run a voiceprint.

132
00:12:22,508 --> 00:12:23,309
How much plutonium?

133
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:24,676
Don't know.

134
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:25,245
Let's pray

135
00:12:25,246 --> 00:12:27,279
it's not a trigger quantity.

136
00:12:27,280 --> 00:12:29,147
Right now, these are

137
00:12:29,148 --> 00:12:31,183
strictly German problems.

138
00:12:31,184 --> 00:12:33,218
You know how they are.

139
00:12:33,219 --> 00:12:34,720
What if the train crosses

140
00:12:34,721 --> 00:12:36,421
a border? Will we take over?

141
00:12:36,422 --> 00:12:38,118
Wishful thinking, Ms. Carver.

142
00:12:41,628 --> 00:12:43,762
I can switch him anywhere you want,

143
00:12:43,763 --> 00:12:45,797
but he might not want to go.

144
00:12:45,798 --> 00:12:47,266
He's on our train,

145
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:48,634
he will go where I send him.

146
00:12:48,635 --> 00:12:50,069
Give me a spur line.

147
00:12:51,371 --> 00:12:52,105
There's a long one

148
00:12:52,106 --> 00:12:53,438
coming up out of Rohrsen.

149
00:12:53,439 --> 00:12:55,408
Send him there.

150
00:13:02,582 --> 00:13:05,984
Franz, what was that?

151
00:13:05,985 --> 00:13:08,079
I think we left the main line.

152
00:13:10,490 --> 00:13:12,958
Yeah, we damn well have.

153
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:14,726
I know where we're going.

154
00:13:14,727 --> 00:13:16,025
You stop this thing.

155
00:13:25,705 --> 00:13:28,436
They know. They're stopping.

156
00:13:30,076 --> 00:13:32,110
No matter,

157
00:13:32,111 --> 00:13:34,410
my men are there.

158
00:13:57,370 --> 00:13:58,804
You... you should have had

159
00:13:58,805 --> 00:14:00,774
a coronary by now, anyhow.

160
00:14:00,907 --> 00:14:02,500
Come on. Come on.

161
00:14:03,710 --> 00:14:05,611
Come on.

162
00:14:06,779 --> 00:14:08,480
You want to do it?

163
00:14:08,481 --> 00:14:11,144
Nein! Nein!

164
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:14,052
Nein! Nein!

165
00:14:14,053 --> 00:14:15,282
Open the door!

166
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:47,781
A hostage has been executed.

167
00:14:53,359 --> 00:14:55,123
Do you like that?

168
00:15:00,466 --> 00:15:02,799
Clear me to Stuttgart.

169
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:11,342
You jerk me again, and two die.

170
00:15:22,054 --> 00:15:23,488
Now this screen's directly

171
00:15:23,489 --> 00:15:25,190
linked to the Bremen police.

172
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:27,192
How's the voiceprint coming?

173
00:15:27,193 --> 00:15:30,459
Mmm, no criminal record on this
clown...

174
00:15:30,530 --> 00:15:32,230
so far.

175
00:15:32,231 --> 00:15:33,732
Isn't that a Midwestern accent?

176
00:15:33,733 --> 00:15:35,767
Hmm.

177
00:15:35,768 --> 00:15:37,636
Where's he going?

178
00:15:37,637 --> 00:15:38,737
Nobody seems to know

179
00:15:38,738 --> 00:15:40,707
how much plutonium's been taken.

180
00:15:42,141 --> 00:15:44,303
What's that?

181
00:15:45,545 --> 00:15:47,846
Damn.

182
00:15:47,847 --> 00:15:48,748
That's a direct link

183
00:15:48,749 --> 00:15:50,782
to Bremen's incoming data.

184
00:15:50,783 --> 00:15:52,251
Where did that originate?

185
00:15:54,554 --> 00:15:56,421
New York here.

186
00:15:56,422 --> 00:15:58,423
Leitzig. He's the department head

187
00:15:58,424 --> 00:16:00,792
who smuggled out the plutonium.

188
00:16:00,793 --> 00:16:04,296
But that's highly classified.

189
00:16:04,297 --> 00:16:06,131
They don't knowi ts source,

190
00:16:06,132 --> 00:16:07,399
but they sure want

191
00:16:07,400 --> 00:16:08,698
to know if it's for real.

192
00:16:11,737 --> 00:16:14,139
Ms. Sanchez, prepare a review

193
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:16,109
of all available field agents.

194
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,448
Sounds good!

195
00:16:23,449 --> 00:16:25,350
Sounds real good.

196
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:29,054
Do you hear the phone?

197
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:30,990
It's your ears ringing.

198
00:16:35,862 --> 00:16:38,497
Why don't I get the phone?

199
00:16:38,498 --> 00:16:40,499
Hello?

200
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:42,634
Michael? It's Malcolm Philpott.

201
00:16:42,635 --> 00:16:45,628
Huh?! Ho-hold on!

202
00:16:49,475 --> 00:16:50,675
That's better. Who's this?

203
00:16:50,676 --> 00:16:52,377
It's Malcolm Philpott.

204
00:16:52,378 --> 00:16:56,448
Phil, man! How are you?

205
00:16:56,449 --> 00:16:58,116
I can't complain.

206
00:16:58,117 --> 00:17:00,385
Michael, is that the sound

207
00:17:00,386 --> 00:17:02,020
of bluegrass I hear

208
00:17:02,021 --> 00:17:03,121
in your voice, instead of Eton?

209
00:17:03,122 --> 00:17:07,822
Ahh, locals still call me "the Brit."

210
00:17:07,894 --> 00:17:09,590
Of course, not to my face.

211
00:17:09,662 --> 00:17:10,862
Of course. Well, Michael,

212
00:17:10,863 --> 00:17:12,898
it's been a while.

213
00:17:12,899 --> 00:17:14,561
Uh-huh.

214
00:17:14,634 --> 00:17:16,762
You're not going to remind me of...

215
00:17:16,836 --> 00:17:19,371
Laos? Do I need to?

216
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,507
Phil, Phil, Phil, please, listen.

217
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:24,170
I've been working on this bike

218
00:17:24,877 --> 00:17:26,175
for over a year now for Daytona.

219
00:17:26,245 --> 00:17:28,111
Qualifying's tomorrow.

220
00:17:28,180 --> 00:17:29,748
Would I call in a favor

221
00:17:29,749 --> 00:17:31,449
unless I needed it?

222
00:17:31,450 --> 00:17:32,684
What's that? I can't hear you!

223
00:17:32,685 --> 00:17:34,313
I can't hear what you're saying!

224
00:17:34,387 --> 00:17:36,879
Say that again?
Then turn her off!

225
00:17:38,691 --> 00:17:40,625
Look, Phil, why don't I get back

226
00:17:40,626 --> 00:17:42,661
to you in a couple of days, okay?

227
00:17:42,662 --> 00:17:44,790
Michael, Europe will be gone!

228
00:17:45,965 --> 00:17:47,666
Oh, really?

229
00:17:47,667 --> 00:17:48,930
Yes!

230
00:17:53,906 --> 00:17:55,073
There'll be a private jet waiting

231
00:17:55,074 --> 00:17:57,009
at the Lexington Airport.

232
00:17:57,076 --> 00:17:58,510
Where are we headed?

233
00:17:58,578 --> 00:17:59,545
First New York and then Munich.

234
00:17:59,546 --> 00:18:01,173
Bring work clothes.

235
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,914
And Michael, after this,

236
00:18:02,915 --> 00:18:04,508
we'll be even on Laos.

237
00:18:10,256 --> 00:18:12,157
Was that your ex-wife?

238
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,092
Worse.

239
00:18:17,964 --> 00:18:20,098
Okay, it's confirmed.

240
00:18:20,099 --> 00:18:20,933
No other law enforcement

241
00:18:20,933 --> 00:18:21,901
or news agency

242
00:18:21,968 --> 00:18:22,802
received that mysterious

243
00:18:22,803 --> 00:18:24,430
bomb message on their computers.

244
00:18:24,503 --> 00:18:26,204
No point in frightening half of

245
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:28,239
Europe before they finish breakfast.

246
00:18:28,240 --> 00:18:30,300
Keep searching, Ms. Sanchez.

247
00:18:32,912 --> 00:18:34,505
That there, yes.

248
00:18:36,082 --> 00:18:38,049
He's new... Rodenko.

249
00:18:38,050 --> 00:18:39,050
Another Russian?

250
00:18:39,051 --> 00:18:40,644
Politics we leave at home.

251
00:18:40,720 --> 00:18:42,621
The major happens to be a former

252
00:18:42,622 --> 00:18:44,591
railway engineer... our only one.

253
00:18:44,657 --> 00:18:48,193
So, Rodenko: Whitlock, physicist:

254
00:18:48,194 --> 00:18:50,857
Kolchinsky, combat chopper pilot:

255
00:18:50,930 --> 00:18:52,497
and Graham.

256
00:18:52,498 --> 00:18:54,194
Who's Graham?

257
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:56,134
He's a former business associate

258
00:18:56,135 --> 00:18:57,268
from my SAS days.

259
00:18:57,269 --> 00:18:58,703
That will fill the bill.

260
00:19:03,709 --> 00:19:05,910
However, I do foresee the need

261
00:19:05,911 --> 00:19:08,613
for an information analyst,

262
00:19:08,614 --> 00:19:11,209
expert marksman, linguist.

263
00:19:11,283 --> 00:19:13,809
Sir?
Get packed.

264
00:19:15,154 --> 00:19:16,645
Yes!

265
00:19:16,722 --> 00:19:18,748
Oh, man!

266
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:03,297
I see you made it.

267
00:20:03,369 --> 00:20:05,361
I just sat back and sipped mint juleps.

268
00:20:05,438 --> 00:20:07,005
Hey, how are you, buddy?!

269
00:20:07,006 --> 00:20:08,039
Good to see you again!

270
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,641
Good.

271
00:20:09,642 --> 00:20:10,809
What did you do,

272
00:20:10,810 --> 00:20:11,778
fall out of your easy chair?

273
00:20:11,844 --> 00:20:13,678
The noble art.

274
00:20:13,679 --> 00:20:15,113
Let me guess...

275
00:20:15,181 --> 00:20:17,673
You should see the other guy!

276
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,013
Oh, yeah!

277
00:20:19,085 --> 00:20:21,820
Oh my, what have we got here?

278
00:20:21,821 --> 00:20:25,090
Your secretary?- No.

279
00:20:25,091 --> 00:20:27,686
You old fart. Your girlfriend?

280
00:20:27,760 --> 00:20:29,422
No.

281
00:20:32,064 --> 00:20:33,794
Your teammate.

282
00:20:34,934 --> 00:20:36,800
No.

283
00:20:43,943 --> 00:20:45,434
Sir...

284
00:20:45,511 --> 00:20:47,445
hey've completed the radio

285
00:20:47,446 --> 00:20:48,480
patch to the hijackers.

286
00:20:48,481 --> 00:20:50,575
Splendid.

287
00:20:53,986 --> 00:20:55,750
Hello?

288
00:20:57,556 --> 00:20:59,457
Hello, is someone there?

289
00:21:03,362 --> 00:21:05,661
If you can hear me,

290
00:21:05,731 --> 00:21:07,432
I would like you to look

291
00:21:07,433 --> 00:21:09,402
upon me as your mediator.

292
00:21:09,468 --> 00:21:11,269
My goal is to help resolve

293
00:21:11,270 --> 00:21:12,403
your problems.

294
00:21:12,404 --> 00:21:14,805
How Christian.

295
00:21:16,408 --> 00:21:18,741
If you... care to look at it that way.

296
00:21:18,811 --> 00:21:20,178
By the way, my name is

297
00:21:20,179 --> 00:21:21,477
Malcolm Philpott, what's yours?

298
00:21:23,582 --> 00:21:25,917
Uh... Elvis Presley.

299
00:21:25,918 --> 00:21:28,153
Look, when I get to Stuttgart,

300
00:21:28,154 --> 00:21:30,123
we'll talk then, all right, Malcolm?

301
00:21:41,467 --> 00:21:42,934
Look, just because

302
00:21:42,935 --> 00:21:44,563
plutonium's been taken

303
00:21:44,637 --> 00:21:45,670
and a phantom message

304
00:21:45,671 --> 00:21:46,639
says there's a bomb,

305
00:21:46,705 --> 00:21:48,401
doesn't mean that there is.

306
00:21:48,474 --> 00:21:50,141
The message mentioned Leitzig

307
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:51,405
and the stolen reactor waste.

308
00:21:51,477 --> 00:21:52,510
Why bother to build it?

309
00:21:52,511 --> 00:21:54,212
Why not buy one off the Ukrainians

310
00:21:54,213 --> 00:21:56,014
or the Chinese?

311
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:56,715
Perhaps it is an end run...

312
00:21:56,716 --> 00:21:58,343
The least likely source.

313
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,147
We have to assume it's for real.

314
00:22:00,219 --> 00:22:01,319
Is that so? Then why doesn't he

315
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:03,688
just fly it there?

316
00:22:03,689 --> 00:22:06,056
It's a lot faster.

317
00:22:06,125 --> 00:22:07,625
Maybe... maybe...

318
00:22:07,626 --> 00:22:09,595
Maybe he's afraid of flying.

319
00:22:11,463 --> 00:22:13,898
Right.

320
00:22:13,999 --> 00:22:15,266
Phil, can I have a word

321
00:22:15,267 --> 00:22:16,895
with you for a minute?

322
00:22:26,445 --> 00:22:28,179
Now, look, I'm not

323
00:22:28,180 --> 00:22:30,215
questioning your judgment,

324
00:22:30,216 --> 00:22:31,946
but she's kind of iffy.

325
00:22:32,017 --> 00:22:34,816
You are questioning my judgment.

326
00:22:34,887 --> 00:22:36,621
Okay, it's just that

327
00:22:36,622 --> 00:22:38,591
we're going into a situation,

328
00:22:38,657 --> 00:22:39,225
I like to know

329
00:22:39,225 --> 00:22:40,193
I can count on people.

330
00:22:40,292 --> 00:22:41,954
Meaning?

331
00:22:42,027 --> 00:22:43,294
She's too good looking to be

332
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,263
anything more than window dressing.

333
00:22:45,264 --> 00:22:46,364
Michael, Ms. Carver

334
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:47,966
speaks four languages,

335
00:22:47,967 --> 00:22:50,436
she runs a mile faster than you ever
did.

336
00:22:50,536 --> 00:22:52,770
She's the best marksman

337
00:22:52,771 --> 00:22:53,805
I've ever known.

338
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:54,773
Mm-hmm, on a range.

339
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:55,741
What about combat?

340
00:22:55,841 --> 00:22:57,275
That's why you're here.

341
00:22:57,343 --> 00:22:59,676
If you don't think there's a bomb,

342
00:22:59,745 --> 00:23:00,845
why not get the train's radiation

343
00:23:00,846 --> 00:23:02,815
signature from a military satellite?

344
00:23:05,050 --> 00:23:06,746
Good idea, Sabrina.

345
00:23:26,538 --> 00:23:28,370
Satellite report...

346
00:23:28,440 --> 00:23:30,500
Elevated radiation levels in the first car

347
00:23:30,609 --> 00:23:32,443
confirm the presence of fissionable

348
00:23:32,444 --> 00:23:33,412
material on the train.

349
00:23:33,479 --> 00:23:36,574
There.- Mm-hmm.

350
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:37,449
At least it's not

351
00:23:37,450 --> 00:23:39,077
a wild goose chase, huh?

352
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:43,148
Is he slowing?

353
00:23:43,255 --> 00:23:44,951
No.

354
00:23:45,057 --> 00:23:46,992
Now what?

355
00:23:50,362 --> 00:23:52,888
You are the UN observers?

356
00:23:52,998 --> 00:23:54,626
Malcolm Philpott, UNACO.

357
00:23:54,733 --> 00:23:57,235
U.N. Anti-Crime unit.

358
00:23:57,236 --> 00:23:59,467
You can observe from over there.

359
00:24:01,740 --> 00:24:04,300
Excuse me, what is your name?

360
00:24:05,411 --> 00:24:07,245
Captain Wolfe.

361
00:24:07,246 --> 00:24:08,179
Captain Wolfe, I understand your

362
00:24:08,247 --> 00:24:10,182
reluctance to relinquish command,

363
00:24:10,282 --> 00:24:12,217
but if you confer with your superiors,

364
00:24:12,318 --> 00:24:14,252
you'll find that I have been

365
00:24:14,253 --> 00:24:16,222
authorized to lead this response.

366
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:18,823
Since when do you people tell

367
00:24:18,824 --> 00:24:21,794
a German anything on his own soil?

368
00:24:21,894 --> 00:24:24,363
Since 2:00 a.m.

369
00:24:28,667 --> 00:24:30,034
Are you running the board?

370
00:24:30,035 --> 00:24:31,333
Yes, sir.

371
00:24:31,437 --> 00:24:31,904
Route him on line 42,

372
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:33,873
through the country.

373
00:24:33,973 --> 00:24:35,640
These are German hostages.

374
00:24:35,641 --> 00:24:36,609
It is our problem.

375
00:24:36,709 --> 00:24:39,008
Ms. Carver, patch
me through to New York.

376
00:24:39,078 --> 00:24:40,578
There is a crucial bit

377
00:24:40,579 --> 00:24:42,548
of information that you don't know.

378
00:24:42,648 --> 00:24:44,310
What information?

379
00:24:45,551 --> 00:24:47,118
Hold those people.

380
00:24:47,119 --> 00:24:48,417
What information?

381
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,488
The hijackers may have

382
00:24:50,489 --> 00:24:52,890
an atomic bomb on the train.

383
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:56,086
May I speak to Hauptmann Wolfe?

384
00:24:58,530 --> 00:25:00,158
Herr Major.-Yeah.

385
00:25:00,265 --> 00:25:01,499
Hauptmann Wolfe.

386
00:25:01,500 --> 00:25:03,731
Er ist ein Englander.

387
00:25:03,836 --> 00:25:05,771
Philpott.

388
00:25:12,745 --> 00:25:14,873
Ja, Herr Major. Ja, ja.

389
00:25:17,016 --> 00:25:19,008
Thank you.

390
00:25:19,118 --> 00:25:21,519
Major Rodenko, Lieutenant

391
00:25:21,520 --> 00:25:22,749
Kolchinsky, I'm Malcolm Philpott.

392
00:25:22,855 --> 00:25:24,585
Welcome.

393
00:25:24,690 --> 00:25:26,955
Sir, we're uplinked.

394
00:25:30,562 --> 00:25:32,530
Major Gennadi Rodenko.

395
00:25:32,531 --> 00:25:34,056
Sabrina Carver.

396
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:36,534
There will be no calls

397
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:38,094
without my authorization.

398
00:25:38,203 --> 00:25:39,004
I was just calling

399
00:25:39,005 --> 00:25:40,632
my wife to let her know.

400
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:41,540
Yes. Look, let me

401
00:25:41,541 --> 00:25:44,100
make this very clear.

402
00:25:44,209 --> 00:25:46,804
No one will know about this bomb.

403
00:25:46,912 --> 00:25:48,642
You will talk to no one,

404
00:25:48,747 --> 00:25:50,548
you will not leave this room

405
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:51,812
unless I approve it.

406
00:25:51,917 --> 00:25:55,217
We're in a state of martial law here,

407
00:25:55,320 --> 00:25:57,050
and I'm the marshal.

408
00:25:57,156 --> 00:26:00,217
Welcome to the West.

409
00:26:00,325 --> 00:26:02,191
And we're his deputies.

410
00:26:04,630 --> 00:26:06,292
Idiot!

411
00:26:06,365 --> 00:26:08,800
German drivers... damn.

412
00:26:08,901 --> 00:26:10,733
Dr. Whitlock?-Yes?

413
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,538
Hi, I'm Dr. Petersen, Chief of Surgery.

414
00:26:13,539 --> 00:26:15,273
Good to meet you. Well?

415
00:26:15,274 --> 00:26:17,436
Carl Leitzig is highly irradiated.

416
00:26:17,543 --> 00:26:19,808
He has extensive DNA breakdown.

417
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,541
He received over 2000 rems.

418
00:26:22,648 --> 00:26:24,549
How long's he got?

419
00:26:24,650 --> 00:26:26,516
Perhaps 48 hours.

420
00:26:26,585 --> 00:26:28,315
Ah, hell.

421
00:26:31,924 --> 00:26:33,057
Rosie, you got to look

422
00:26:33,058 --> 00:26:34,425
past your bank account.

423
00:26:34,426 --> 00:26:37,157
I never trust banks, Alex.

424
00:26:37,229 --> 00:26:38,063
This isn't about money,

425
00:26:38,064 --> 00:26:40,032
it's about patriotism.

426
00:26:40,099 --> 00:26:41,199
See, I'm an American.

427
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,234
I love my country.

428
00:26:43,235 --> 00:26:45,036
America's lost right now.

429
00:26:45,037 --> 00:26:46,471
See, we define ourselves

430
00:26:46,472 --> 00:26:48,100
by who we hate, right?

431
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,241
And no matter what you say,

432
00:26:50,242 --> 00:26:52,211
the USSR was a very worthy opponent.

433
00:26:54,046 --> 00:26:55,613
'Cause of this new world order

434
00:26:55,614 --> 00:26:57,048
thing, can't use that.

435
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:58,616
No, once you know who you hate,

436
00:26:58,617 --> 00:27:00,586
everything works.

437
00:27:04,523 --> 00:27:05,991
Yeah?

438
00:27:06,058 --> 00:27:08,391
You handled your first obstacle well.

439
00:27:08,460 --> 00:27:09,228
Yeah, right... you got

440
00:27:09,229 --> 00:27:10,595
to let 'em know who's boss.

441
00:27:10,596 --> 00:27:13,731
Now we adjust our procedure.

442
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,133
I will initiate

443
00:27:15,134 --> 00:27:17,168
all telephone contact with you.

444
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:19,001
I will keep you informed.

445
00:27:20,072 --> 00:27:21,768
Yeah, right.

446
00:27:33,619 --> 00:27:36,120
I'm C.W. Whitlock, physicist.

447
00:27:36,121 --> 00:27:37,655
I've never made an atomic bomb,

448
00:27:37,656 --> 00:27:39,249
but I've wondered if I could.

449
00:27:39,324 --> 00:27:40,849
It's demanding, isn't it?

450
00:27:42,094 --> 00:27:42,761
Where's the train?

451
00:27:42,762 --> 00:27:45,595
Past Stuttgart. Where's it going?

452
00:27:50,569 --> 00:27:53,129
I'll just hang out here for a while, okay?

453
00:27:54,406 --> 00:27:55,506
Of course the German government

454
00:27:55,507 --> 00:27:57,542
are happy to let them chug on

455
00:27:57,543 --> 00:27:58,143
until they reach Switzerland,

456
00:27:58,144 --> 00:27:59,510
but the Swiss

457
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:00,678
are demanding action

458
00:28:00,679 --> 00:28:02,246
before they reach the border.

459
00:28:02,247 --> 00:28:03,948
A wise idea, sir.

460
00:28:03,949 --> 00:28:05,583
Excuse me. The hijackers just

461
00:28:05,584 --> 00:28:07,285
received a phone call from Munich.

462
00:28:07,286 --> 00:28:08,286
We didn't expect it...

463
00:28:08,287 --> 00:28:09,346
Missed getting anything.

464
00:28:09,421 --> 00:28:10,222
Damn it. I hope

465
00:28:10,223 --> 00:28:11,923
you're tuned in now.

466
00:28:11,924 --> 00:28:14,519
Yes.-Good.

467
00:28:14,593 --> 00:28:15,693
So... Ms. Carver, stay with us.

468
00:28:15,694 --> 00:28:17,390
It is to be gas somatol.

469
00:28:17,462 --> 00:28:18,462
Subdues motor reflexes

470
00:28:18,463 --> 00:28:20,432
for about two hours.

471
00:28:20,499 --> 00:28:22,024
I would recommend it.

472
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,701
Phil, sleeping gas and the public

473
00:28:23,702 --> 00:28:24,931
don't mix too well together.

474
00:28:25,003 --> 00:28:26,804
Sigi, any unpopulated areas

475
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:27,773
before Zurich?

476
00:28:27,839 --> 00:28:28,707
Only one... the train

477
00:28:28,708 --> 00:28:30,208
will be there in 40 minutes.

478
00:28:30,209 --> 00:28:31,837
Good. Excellent.

479
00:28:31,910 --> 00:28:32,811
The German military

480
00:28:32,812 --> 00:28:33,844
have agreed to back us.

481
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:36,547
You'll fly Michael and the major.

482
00:28:36,548 --> 00:28:37,516
Yes, sir.

483
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:40,178
Are you familiar with the M203?-
Very.

484
00:28:40,252 --> 00:28:41,419
We'll use that grenade launcher to

485
00:28:41,420 --> 00:28:43,454
crack some gas into the locomotive.

486
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,822
Wait a second... she's going

487
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:45,856
to shoot gas canisters

488
00:28:45,857 --> 00:28:47,655
into a train going 70 miles an hour?

489
00:28:47,726 --> 00:28:49,393
Yes, she is.

490
00:28:49,394 --> 00:28:50,428
We've got a situation here

491
00:28:50,429 --> 00:28:51,762
that could make Chernobyl look like

492
00:28:51,763 --> 00:28:52,797
a pop gun, and she's point man?

493
00:28:52,798 --> 00:28:57,702
Point person.- Hey! Now, enough.

494
00:28:57,703 --> 00:28:59,370
She has backup, sir?

495
00:28:59,371 --> 00:29:01,672
Yes, you... helicopter launch rockets.

496
00:29:01,673 --> 00:29:04,142
- Yay!
- All right, Phil.

497
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,011
Michael?- Mm-hmm?

498
00:29:09,081 --> 00:29:11,676
You can't call me Phil in this group.

499
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,849
What do you want me to call you?

500
00:29:14,920 --> 00:29:16,616
"Sir" would be appropriate.

501
00:29:18,190 --> 00:29:19,783
All right.

502
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,626
Let's do it.

503
00:29:28,533 --> 00:29:30,701
Don't let the boys' club bother you.

504
00:29:30,702 --> 00:29:34,298
What if I miss?-You can't.

505
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:49,221
C.W.- Malcolm.

506
00:29:49,288 --> 00:29:50,388
You've been boxing

507
00:29:50,389 --> 00:29:51,357
with the brothers again?

508
00:29:51,423 --> 00:29:53,257
I told you about that. You all right?

509
00:29:53,258 --> 00:29:56,093
I'm fine. How's Leitzig?

510
00:29:56,094 --> 00:29:58,362
He's dying, but he's got some time

511
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,730
before he slips into the grave.

512
00:29:59,731 --> 00:30:01,666
And he's not a big talker, I'm afraid.

513
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,501
Is there anything we can do?

514
00:30:03,502 --> 00:30:04,735
Sure, run another check

515
00:30:04,736 --> 00:30:06,437
on all of his acquaintances.

516
00:30:06,438 --> 00:30:07,805
You know, his friends, his lovers...

517
00:30:07,806 --> 00:30:09,473
I need some leverage.

518
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:11,238
Will do.

519
00:30:11,310 --> 00:30:12,743
If we can determine

520
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:14,111
the amount of plute he stole,

521
00:30:14,112 --> 00:30:16,113
it'll give us an idea of the size of

522
00:30:16,114 --> 00:30:18,049
the gadget that we're dealing with.

523
00:30:18,116 --> 00:30:20,017
What I can't figure out

524
00:30:20,018 --> 00:30:21,152
is who would send

525
00:30:21,153 --> 00:30:22,451
the message about the bomb,

526
00:30:22,521 --> 00:30:23,521
unless it was

527
00:30:23,522 --> 00:30:25,457
one of Leitzig's friends.

528
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:28,421
Perhaps it was an enemy.

529
00:31:59,284 --> 00:32:00,284
Does Sabrina Carver

530
00:32:00,285 --> 00:32:02,584
have Philpott by...?

531
00:32:02,654 --> 00:32:04,422
Her dad's some

532
00:32:04,423 --> 00:32:06,457
state department honcho,

533
00:32:06,458 --> 00:32:08,654
and a friend of Philpott's.

534
00:32:08,727 --> 00:32:10,161
I suffered under party

535
00:32:10,162 --> 00:32:12,131
member's children before.

536
00:32:12,197 --> 00:32:14,532
Same everywhere, eh?- Ah!

537
00:32:14,533 --> 00:32:15,699
Well, at least

538
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:17,328
she's not in command.

539
00:32:28,513 --> 00:32:30,106
Get down!

540
00:32:31,716 --> 00:32:33,912
Okay, one shot, Sabrina.

541
00:32:33,985 --> 00:32:35,953
One shot.

542
00:32:35,954 --> 00:32:37,650
Ah, my gas mask!

543
00:32:40,425 --> 00:32:42,189
How's our fuel?

544
00:32:42,260 --> 00:32:43,360
At this rate, we can make

545
00:32:43,361 --> 00:32:44,659
Istanbul, maybe more.

546
00:32:57,809 --> 00:32:58,799
Damn it!

547
00:33:00,278 --> 00:33:02,144
Gas! Gas!

548
00:33:02,214 --> 00:33:04,342
Gas! Gas! Gas!

549
00:33:06,051 --> 00:33:07,314
Gas!

550
00:33:09,621 --> 00:33:12,122
Yes! Perfect hit!

551
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:14,058
It's all yours!

552
00:33:14,059 --> 00:33:16,551
All right, let's go!

553
00:33:21,466 --> 00:33:23,934
UNACO 2 and 3, UNACO Leader.

554
00:33:23,935 --> 00:33:27,133
Formate on me. Hold back 50 meters.

555
00:33:31,276 --> 00:33:32,643
You okay?

556
00:33:32,644 --> 00:33:34,011
Yeah, I'm okay. I'm okay.

557
00:33:34,012 --> 00:33:37,141
Move it, you guys!- Check your loads.

558
00:33:42,521 --> 00:33:45,218
UNACO Leader, target in sight.

559
00:33:46,358 --> 00:33:48,025
Number three, hold position.

560
00:33:48,026 --> 00:33:49,760
Number two, move in!

561
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,855
Wilco.

562
00:33:51,930 --> 00:33:54,598
UNACO 2, system's ready.- Roger.

563
00:33:54,599 --> 00:33:56,192
Fire at will!

564
00:33:58,303 --> 00:34:01,398
On target! I got 'em! It's hit!

565
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,606
Gas in the car! Gas in the car!

566
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:13,049
Number three engaging. Bull's-eye!

567
00:34:16,021 --> 00:34:17,988
Number three, breaking off.

568
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:20,254
They are sleeping like babies!

569
00:34:22,160 --> 00:34:23,628
I'm dropping you down.

570
00:34:25,130 --> 00:34:27,264
Two and three, hold back.

571
00:34:27,265 --> 00:34:28,299
I'm moving in.

572
00:34:28,300 --> 00:34:29,800
We're right over it.

573
00:34:29,801 --> 00:34:31,168
We're right over the top.

574
00:34:31,169 --> 00:34:33,871
Number three, pull up!

575
00:34:33,872 --> 00:34:35,205
Oops.

576
00:34:35,206 --> 00:34:37,141
Steady, bring me down,

577
00:34:37,142 --> 00:34:38,175
bring me down.

578
00:34:38,176 --> 00:34:39,810
Bring me down, Kolchinsky.

579
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:40,178
That's it.

580
00:34:40,179 --> 00:34:43,480
Okay, to the right, to the right.

581
00:34:43,481 --> 00:34:45,143
Keep with it!

582
00:34:46,518 --> 00:34:48,852
Okay, I'm on! I'm on!

583
00:34:48,853 --> 00:34:50,685
Okay.

584
00:34:50,755 --> 00:34:53,657
Number two, move in. Stay close.

585
00:34:55,527 --> 00:34:57,394
Hold tight! Wait!

586
00:34:57,395 --> 00:34:59,530
Wait. Easy!

587
00:34:59,531 --> 00:35:01,398
Two alongside.

588
00:35:01,399 --> 00:35:03,834
Moving in closer.

589
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,835
Open fire!

590
00:35:04,836 --> 00:35:06,870
Shit, they are wide awake!

591
00:35:06,871 --> 00:35:09,673
They've got gas masks!
What?

592
00:35:09,674 --> 00:35:11,609
There's a fucking army in there!

593
00:35:13,111 --> 00:35:14,943
Got one, got one!

594
00:35:15,013 --> 00:35:16,113
Give me backup, come on!

595
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:17,309
Give me some backup!

596
00:35:17,382 --> 00:35:20,511
Can't take 'em out! I'm hit!

597
00:35:20,585 --> 00:35:24,181
- I got 'em!
- He's hit! He's hit!

598
00:35:27,425 --> 00:35:29,627
Aw, shit! Shit!

599
00:35:29,628 --> 00:35:34,932
Kolchinsky, are you okay?

600
00:35:34,933 --> 00:35:37,234
Talk to me, all right?-Yeah.

601
00:35:37,235 --> 00:35:40,070
Hold your fire! What's he doing?

602
00:35:40,071 --> 00:35:42,106
Taken hits, rotor vibrating.

603
00:35:42,107 --> 00:35:44,975
Back off! Back off! Watch out!

604
00:35:44,976 --> 00:35:47,241
Watch this.

605
00:36:01,593 --> 00:36:03,528
You bastard!

606
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:15,337
Mike! Mike, talk to me.

607
00:36:16,408 --> 00:36:18,400
Pull away! Pull away!

608
00:36:27,085 --> 00:36:29,145
Shit!

609
00:36:35,427 --> 00:36:37,361
Kolchinsky!

610
00:36:37,362 --> 00:36:39,422
Get your ass down here, now!

611
00:36:40,498 --> 00:36:42,194
Kolchinsky, come on!

612
00:36:43,935 --> 00:36:45,703
Come on! Closer!

613
00:36:45,704 --> 00:36:49,606
Shit! Give me the other clip.

614
00:36:49,607 --> 00:36:51,875
Come on! Get down here!

615
00:36:51,876 --> 00:36:53,071
Oh, God!

616
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:57,539
Come closer! Closer!

617
00:36:57,649 --> 00:36:58,782
You son of a bitch,

618
00:36:58,783 --> 00:37:00,818
get the fuck off my train!

619
00:37:00,819 --> 00:37:03,482
Closer, Kolchinsky! Get it down here!

620
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:05,786
Jump! Jump on it!

621
00:37:07,125 --> 00:37:09,890
Eat flames, cocksucker!- Ah! Ah!

622
00:37:13,531 --> 00:37:16,194
Come on, Graham, jump!

623
00:37:16,267 --> 00:37:18,035
Okay.

624
00:37:18,036 --> 00:37:20,232
Stay right there! Stay there!

625
00:37:22,874 --> 00:37:23,608
Okay, hang on!

626
00:37:23,609 --> 00:37:25,907
Let's get out of here!

627
00:37:26,010 --> 00:37:27,444
Fuck! Fuck!

628
00:37:43,128 --> 00:37:44,892
Fuck it.

629
00:37:46,765 --> 00:37:49,633
Grab on! Grab my hand!

630
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,762
You... yeah! Bastard.- It's okay.

631
00:37:51,870 --> 00:37:54,169
You're okay.

632
00:38:00,245 --> 00:38:02,379
Bad luck, eh?

633
00:38:02,380 --> 00:38:06,579
Yeah, lousy. Real lousy, yeah.

634
00:38:13,391 --> 00:38:15,859
A funeral pyre of twisted metal

635
00:38:15,860 --> 00:38:16,994
is all that remains

636
00:38:16,995 --> 00:38:18,623
of the elite German unit.

637
00:38:18,730 --> 00:38:21,165
Speculation as to the hostages' safety

638
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:21,933
continues as the train

639
00:38:21,934 --> 00:38:23,231
approaches Zurich,

640
00:38:23,334 --> 00:38:24,935
having crossed the Swiss border

641
00:38:24,936 --> 00:38:25,904
30 minutes ago.

642
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:28,939
Now we go live to Freight 4402

643
00:38:28,940 --> 00:38:30,909
entering Zurich.

644
00:38:31,009 --> 00:38:33,444
The identity or goals of the hijackers

645
00:38:33,545 --> 00:38:35,036
remains a mystery.

646
00:38:35,146 --> 00:38:37,980
- Hey, look!
- Oh my God.

647
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:39,416
What we've just witnessed

648
00:38:39,417 --> 00:38:42,387
is an execution by one of the...

649
00:38:42,487 --> 00:38:44,683
No, we're waiting for official word,

650
00:38:44,789 --> 00:38:46,190
but it appears to have been

651
00:38:46,191 --> 00:38:47,489
a cold-blooded retaliation

652
00:38:47,592 --> 00:38:48,892
for the German military's

653
00:38:48,893 --> 00:38:49,519
earlier attempt

654
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:52,119
to take control of the train.

655
00:38:52,230 --> 00:38:53,730
Two as promised.

656
00:38:53,731 --> 00:38:54,332
This obviously

657
00:38:54,333 --> 00:38:55,823
confirms the hijackers...

658
00:38:55,934 --> 00:38:58,130
But no mention of the bomb.

659
00:38:58,236 --> 00:39:00,865
At least we keep that secret.

660
00:39:00,972 --> 00:39:02,339
I should have known

661
00:39:02,340 --> 00:39:04,366
they'd have gas gear.

662
00:39:04,442 --> 00:39:06,377
They were too well prepared to
ignore...

663
00:39:06,444 --> 00:39:08,037
Aren't you ashamed?

664
00:39:08,146 --> 00:39:09,379
I told you I'd kill two

665
00:39:09,380 --> 00:39:11,349
if you screwed with me again.

666
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:20,324
Killing hostages will make no
difference.

667
00:39:20,325 --> 00:39:22,089
It's stupid! You're a fool!

668
00:39:23,528 --> 00:39:26,363
What happened to mediating,
Malcolm?

669
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,799
You're not taking sides now, are you?

670
00:39:31,002 --> 00:39:34,872
Dispatch, route me to Bolzano, Italy.

671
00:39:34,873 --> 00:39:37,172
The junction's in two kilometers.

672
00:39:40,011 --> 00:39:42,012
Bolzano.

673
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:45,609
And Malcolm, try to calm down.

674
00:39:54,826 --> 00:39:56,460
You couldn't have known.

675
00:39:56,461 --> 00:39:58,495
Tell the dead.

676
00:39:58,496 --> 00:40:00,530
I thought I knew him.

677
00:40:00,531 --> 00:40:04,491
Phil... sir... Angola.

678
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,270
You remember Angola?

679
00:40:08,339 --> 00:40:09,274
This guy fought in our unit,

680
00:40:09,275 --> 00:40:11,308
we fought with this guy.

681
00:40:11,309 --> 00:40:12,143
I don't remember his name,

682
00:40:12,144 --> 00:40:14,177
but I'd swear he's a merc.

683
00:40:14,178 --> 00:40:16,272
Maybe.

684
00:40:17,348 --> 00:40:19,416
Have Yolanda narrow her search

685
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:21,386
to the mercenary database.

686
00:40:21,452 --> 00:40:23,153
Yes, sir.

687
00:40:23,154 --> 00:40:26,420
"Know thy enemy," sir?- Right.

688
00:40:26,491 --> 00:40:28,425
If he is a mercenary, he'll never

689
00:40:28,426 --> 00:40:29,593
blow himself up for ideals...

690
00:40:29,594 --> 00:40:31,586
He's in this for the money.

691
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:33,598
He'll never detonate that bomb.

692
00:40:35,133 --> 00:40:36,795
Another assumption.

693
00:40:41,105 --> 00:40:42,539
Examine the route

694
00:40:42,540 --> 00:40:44,574
between Zurich and Bolzano.

695
00:40:44,575 --> 00:40:45,443
Maybe the Alps

696
00:40:45,444 --> 00:40:47,144
will give us an opportunity.

697
00:40:47,145 --> 00:40:49,774
Yeah, sir.

698
00:41:01,626 --> 00:41:03,760
Man, reminds me

699
00:41:03,761 --> 00:41:05,730
of blind dates I've had.

700
00:41:09,867 --> 00:41:12,166
Mmm, hold it!

701
00:41:13,438 --> 00:41:17,375
Probability of a match.

702
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:21,673
Not bad.

703
00:41:21,746 --> 00:41:24,875
Tierney, Alex.

704
00:41:27,051 --> 00:41:28,618
From the dead hijacker

705
00:41:28,619 --> 00:41:29,653
we shot off the train?

706
00:41:29,654 --> 00:41:31,748
Yeah.

707
00:41:33,758 --> 00:41:35,492
There aren't many R4s...

708
00:41:35,493 --> 00:41:36,626
South African.

709
00:41:36,627 --> 00:41:38,061
Fine weapon, but most governments

710
00:41:38,062 --> 00:41:40,097
don't do business with them.

711
00:41:40,098 --> 00:41:40,798
We're checking the serial number

712
00:41:40,799 --> 00:41:42,499
with the manufacturer

713
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,500
to find out who purchased

714
00:41:43,501 --> 00:41:44,469
this little gem.

715
00:41:44,470 --> 00:41:46,903
And then, we follow the money.

716
00:41:46,904 --> 00:41:48,238
Somebody has to be

717
00:41:48,239 --> 00:41:50,273
financing those hijackers.

718
00:41:50,274 --> 00:41:52,072
Mr. Philpott.

719
00:41:54,012 --> 00:41:56,313
Ahh, and there we are.

720
00:41:56,314 --> 00:41:58,949
AlexTierney, mercenary.

721
00:41:58,950 --> 00:42:02,152
Out of Miami, works for anyone.

722
00:42:02,153 --> 00:42:03,387
Look at that... I could

723
00:42:03,388 --> 00:42:05,422
beat that on one cylinder.

724
00:42:05,423 --> 00:42:06,456
Michael! There's always

725
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:07,824
Sebring or Watkins Glen.

726
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:09,459
We've gotten the okay from

727
00:42:09,460 --> 00:42:10,494
the Swiss and Italian governments.

728
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:13,522
Splendid! Now, as discussed,

729
00:42:13,598 --> 00:42:14,465
the train's route takes it

730
00:42:14,466 --> 00:42:16,434
through one alpine tunnel...

731
00:42:16,501 --> 00:42:17,235
10 kilometers long...

732
00:42:17,236 --> 00:42:19,204
We stop Tierney there.

733
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:20,537
We block both ends with locomotives

734
00:42:20,538 --> 00:42:22,572
onceTierney's inside.

735
00:42:22,573 --> 00:42:23,740
An Italian railcrew's on its way

736
00:42:23,741 --> 00:42:25,442
to rip up track deep in the tunnel.

737
00:42:25,443 --> 00:42:27,310
All right.

738
00:42:27,311 --> 00:42:28,212
Isn't what we're doing more

739
00:42:28,213 --> 00:42:30,247
important than whizzing in a circle?

740
00:42:30,248 --> 00:42:31,381
Sigi, we'll need

741
00:42:31,382 --> 00:42:32,350
direct radio communication

742
00:42:32,417 --> 00:42:33,683
with the Italian railcrew.

743
00:42:33,684 --> 00:42:35,653
Michael, please.

744
00:42:35,720 --> 00:42:37,655
And if the bomb detonates,

745
00:42:37,722 --> 00:42:38,722
then the effect will be

746
00:42:38,723 --> 00:42:41,488
minimized by the tunnel.

747
00:42:41,559 --> 00:42:42,592
I swear this guyTierney

748
00:42:42,593 --> 00:42:43,627
won't set it off.

749
00:42:43,628 --> 00:42:44,228
What if the control is

750
00:42:44,229 --> 00:42:46,496
in someone else's hands?

751
00:42:46,497 --> 00:42:48,365
I mean, it could be.

752
00:42:48,366 --> 00:42:52,369
Then... our mission will be over.

753
00:42:52,370 --> 00:42:54,134
The bomb will be dealt with.

754
00:42:56,574 --> 00:42:58,341
At its present rate,

755
00:42:58,342 --> 00:43:00,043
4402's about an hour

756
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,912
from the Swiss head of the tunnel.

757
00:43:01,913 --> 00:43:03,779
And there you have it.

758
00:43:05,249 --> 00:43:06,842
Mm-hmm.

759
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:32,075
Yeah?

760
00:43:32,076 --> 00:43:35,178
Collect insurance, kilometer 842.

761
00:43:35,179 --> 00:43:38,547
Got it. 10-4, good buddy.

762
00:43:42,787 --> 00:43:44,821
Sir, headquarters just called.

763
00:43:44,822 --> 00:43:45,922
Tierney's cellular received

764
00:43:45,923 --> 00:43:46,957
a nine-second call...

765
00:43:46,958 --> 00:43:49,793
Not enough time to trace its origin.

766
00:43:49,794 --> 00:43:51,990
Outside support. Thank you.

767
00:43:52,063 --> 00:43:53,897
Sigi, what's the status

768
00:43:53,898 --> 00:43:54,866
with the Italian railcrew?

769
00:43:58,769 --> 00:44:00,738
Attention, Italian crew...

770
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:18,822
Sir, 4402's slowing.

771
00:44:18,823 --> 00:44:20,790
What?

772
00:44:20,791 --> 00:44:23,488
Yes, the hijackers are slowing.

773
00:44:27,565 --> 00:44:29,830
Hustle! Hustle! Hustle!

774
00:44:31,636 --> 00:44:34,004
Come on!

775
00:44:34,005 --> 00:44:36,531
Okay, all right. Okay.

776
00:44:36,607 --> 00:44:38,473
Where are they?

777
00:44:40,178 --> 00:44:41,976
Just an alpine grade.

778
00:44:42,046 --> 00:44:45,210
It's yard 842, a supply yard.

779
00:44:46,284 --> 00:44:47,616
Damn!

780
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:50,717
Go! Let's go!

781
00:44:52,156 --> 00:44:53,954
I got it.

782
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:13,944
Great, where's the Italian military?

783
00:45:13,945 --> 00:45:15,879
Maybe they're already inside.

784
00:45:15,880 --> 00:45:18,145
No, they're Italian... they're late.

785
00:45:18,216 --> 00:45:19,809
To hell with it, let's go. Come on.

786
00:45:25,856 --> 00:45:27,424
Philpott, we don't see our

787
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:28,723
Italian backup, we're moving in.

788
00:45:48,813 --> 00:45:51,114
Sigi, the blip behind Tierney

789
00:45:51,115 --> 00:45:52,083
is our rear blockade?

790
00:45:52,149 --> 00:45:53,817
Yes, sir.

791
00:45:53,818 --> 00:45:54,951
They won't be leaving

792
00:45:54,952 --> 00:45:55,920
the way they came.

793
00:45:55,987 --> 00:45:58,154
And why isn't our Italian locomotive

794
00:45:58,155 --> 00:46:00,124
moving to blockade the other end?

795
00:46:02,026 --> 00:46:03,760
Italian dispatch, what's

796
00:46:03,761 --> 00:46:06,560
the status of your locomotive?

797
00:46:31,789 --> 00:46:34,524
Italian locomotive,

798
00:46:34,525 --> 00:46:37,560
clear to Tirano tunnel, over.

799
00:46:37,561 --> 00:46:39,359
Anything approaching?

800
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:43,030
Only my lunch.

801
00:46:55,246 --> 00:46:56,908
Alex!

802
00:46:56,981 --> 00:46:58,916
It's our mediator.

803
00:47:05,623 --> 00:47:07,424
Yes.

804
00:47:07,425 --> 00:47:09,059
Tierney, we've torn up track

805
00:47:09,060 --> 00:47:12,030
in front of you... stop the train.

806
00:47:12,096 --> 00:47:16,534
That's Mr. Tierney, if you please.

807
00:47:16,600 --> 00:47:18,268
There's no way out.

808
00:47:18,269 --> 00:47:20,238
We'll see about that.

809
00:47:30,214 --> 00:47:32,581
Hey, did you get it done?

810
00:47:53,904 --> 00:47:56,066
Ho! Ho!

811
00:48:10,354 --> 00:48:13,390
Two half-lengths!

812
00:48:13,391 --> 00:48:15,257
Bring the spanners!

813
00:48:25,870 --> 00:48:27,203
They replaced the rail. What

814
00:48:27,204 --> 00:48:29,139
the hell were those Italians doing?

815
00:48:31,842 --> 00:48:33,868
Let's go.

816
00:48:34,945 --> 00:48:36,675
Flare grenades first.

817
00:48:43,687 --> 00:48:45,383
Come on, come on!

818
00:48:50,661 --> 00:48:52,729
- Are we repaired?!
- Not yet!

819
00:48:52,730 --> 00:48:53,930
Rodenko, what the hell

820
00:48:53,931 --> 00:48:54,899
are you doing, guy?

821
00:48:56,267 --> 00:48:57,860
We got to go!

822
00:49:00,037 --> 00:49:02,097
Hit it, we got to go! We got to go!

823
00:49:15,286 --> 00:49:17,187
Okay.- Hit it, we're clear.

824
00:49:19,256 --> 00:49:22,192
Fuck! Fuck. Shit!

825
00:49:33,637 --> 00:49:37,870
- Major!
- I'm okay... flak-jacket.

826
00:49:50,788 --> 00:49:53,223
Shit, I only speak English.

827
00:50:10,508 --> 00:50:12,204
Fuck! Gun's jammed.

828
00:50:20,784 --> 00:50:22,878
Nick!

829
00:50:22,953 --> 00:50:24,615
Nick!

830
00:50:24,688 --> 00:50:27,123
Nick, stay down, we'll get to you!

831
00:50:30,127 --> 00:50:31,891
You're covered!

832
00:50:46,310 --> 00:50:48,011
Okay, let's go, let's go.

833
00:50:48,012 --> 00:50:48,980
Move it! Move it!

834
00:52:05,723 --> 00:52:09,023
At least the bomb didn't go off.

835
00:52:09,126 --> 00:52:12,392
Let's not let failure go to our heads.

836
00:52:14,798 --> 00:52:16,528
Yes, Philpott.

837
00:52:16,634 --> 00:52:17,634
Sir, we've got an ID from

838
00:52:17,635 --> 00:52:19,968
the South African manufacturer

839
00:52:20,070 --> 00:52:23,063
on the hijacker's weapon.- And?

840
00:52:23,173 --> 00:52:24,907
It was purchased on a standing

841
00:52:24,908 --> 00:52:26,206
Russian military account.

842
00:52:26,310 --> 00:52:28,311
Russian? What branch?

843
00:52:28,312 --> 00:52:29,612
Spetsnaz. No names

844
00:52:29,613 --> 00:52:30,581
on the requisition.

845
00:52:30,681 --> 00:52:31,914
See if they'll tell you who's

846
00:52:31,915 --> 00:52:33,543
authorized to use that account.

847
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:38,254
Russian.

848
00:52:38,255 --> 00:52:40,451
What's it like on the train?

849
00:52:40,524 --> 00:52:42,258
Always two men with guns

850
00:52:42,259 --> 00:52:43,227
watching the bomb.

851
00:52:43,327 --> 00:52:44,894
They never fed us.

852
00:52:44,895 --> 00:52:46,929
We'll get you some grub soon.

853
00:52:46,930 --> 00:52:48,798
Listen, tell me something...

854
00:52:48,799 --> 00:52:50,166
Did anybody tinker with it?

855
00:52:50,167 --> 00:52:51,863
Tinker?

856
00:52:51,935 --> 00:52:54,103
No, the leader

857
00:52:54,104 --> 00:52:55,138
only studied the outside.

858
00:52:55,139 --> 00:52:56,139
There's a locked

859
00:52:56,140 --> 00:52:57,840
telephone keypad.

860
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,841
Detonation code

861
00:52:58,842 --> 00:53:00,510
could be entered right there.

862
00:53:00,511 --> 00:53:02,241
Maybe it's a phone.

863
00:53:02,346 --> 00:53:04,180
Somebody could call it,

864
00:53:04,181 --> 00:53:04,982
like a fax machine.

865
00:53:04,983 --> 00:53:07,050
So, Tierney wouldn't blow

866
00:53:07,051 --> 00:53:09,085
himself up, but someone else would?

867
00:53:09,086 --> 00:53:10,787
No, no, he wouldn't let that happen.

868
00:53:10,788 --> 00:53:12,088
No, Mike, Tierney doesn't

869
00:53:12,089 --> 00:53:14,058
have a clue. He doesn't know.

870
00:53:18,162 --> 00:53:20,222
So despite valiant efforts,

871
00:53:20,297 --> 00:53:21,931
Freight 4402 continues south

872
00:53:21,932 --> 00:53:23,966
with its cargo of hostages.

873
00:53:23,967 --> 00:53:27,028
Brian Poole, BBC, Milan.

874
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:01,163
Hijacked train 4402 is proving to be

875
00:54:01,238 --> 00:54:03,172
a law enforcement nightmare.

876
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:04,874
Repeated attempts to overpower or

877
00:54:04,875 --> 00:54:06,909
outsmart the hijackers have failed,

878
00:54:06,910 --> 00:54:08,044
leaving a trail of bodies

879
00:54:08,045 --> 00:54:10,079
along the tracks...

880
00:54:10,080 --> 00:54:11,447
I got an inventory of materials

881
00:54:11,448 --> 00:54:14,484
unaccounted for from the plant.

882
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:15,918
How good

883
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:16,953
a bomb builder are you?

884
00:54:16,954 --> 00:54:18,955
You tell me.

885
00:54:18,956 --> 00:54:20,223
A sloppy scientist would use that

886
00:54:20,224 --> 00:54:22,258
much plutonium to make one bomb.

887
00:54:22,259 --> 00:54:24,360
Or he could be

888
00:54:24,361 --> 00:54:25,394
a craftsman and make two.

889
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,421
The latest reports put the train

890
00:54:27,498 --> 00:54:28,498
somewhere in the Alps,

891
00:54:28,499 --> 00:54:29,432
near the Italian border.

892
00:54:31,168 --> 00:54:33,669
Sigi.- Oh, thanks.

893
00:54:33,670 --> 00:54:34,937
There's a great deal of poetry

894
00:54:34,938 --> 00:54:36,566
and fine sentiment in a cup of tea.

895
00:54:36,640 --> 00:54:38,875
I hope there's also a lot of caffeine.

896
00:54:38,876 --> 00:54:40,840
Mr. Philpott, I've got Graham.

897
00:54:43,714 --> 00:54:45,248
Yeah, Philpott.

898
00:54:45,249 --> 00:54:47,283
You paged, "Bwana"?

899
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:51,521
You alone?- More or less.

900
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:53,723
Your team's chowin' down.

901
00:54:53,724 --> 00:54:56,956
Hey, Michael, it's your team, too.

902
00:54:58,295 --> 00:55:00,062
The hijackers' weapons search

903
00:55:00,063 --> 00:55:01,764
seems to have paid off.

904
00:55:01,765 --> 00:55:03,299
But there may be a problem

905
00:55:03,300 --> 00:55:07,069
with at least one of the Russians.

906
00:55:07,070 --> 00:55:09,539
No kidding... in my team?

907
00:55:09,540 --> 00:55:12,341
All right, all right.

908
00:55:12,342 --> 00:55:14,510
I think this whole hijacking

909
00:55:14,511 --> 00:55:16,480
is being financed out of Moscow.

910
00:55:17,581 --> 00:55:19,849
Brings new meaning to the term

911
00:55:19,850 --> 00:55:21,884
"Russian roulette," eh?

912
00:55:21,885 --> 00:55:23,786
Do you want me to split them up?

913
00:55:23,787 --> 00:55:24,821
No.

914
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,823
I'll keep a close watch.

915
00:55:26,824 --> 00:55:28,759
All right. Good luck.

916
00:55:33,864 --> 00:55:35,492
Thanks.

917
00:55:38,268 --> 00:55:40,499
Well?

918
00:55:42,773 --> 00:55:44,503
It's good.

919
00:55:45,943 --> 00:55:48,412
What did Philpott say?

920
00:55:48,478 --> 00:55:51,714
We tail the train.-That's all?

921
00:55:51,715 --> 00:55:54,048
That and a pat on the butt.

922
00:55:55,319 --> 00:55:57,220
Can't you find a way to just trust me?

923
00:55:58,789 --> 00:56:00,223
I don't know what you're

924
00:56:00,224 --> 00:56:01,257
talking about, sweetheart.

925
00:56:01,258 --> 00:56:03,022
The name's Sabrina.

926
00:56:04,795 --> 00:56:07,196
What are you holding back, Mike?

927
00:56:07,197 --> 00:56:09,757
Not a thing.

928
00:56:09,833 --> 00:56:12,098
I tell it like it is, and it's like this...

929
00:56:13,837 --> 00:56:15,772
I'm runnin' this field operation.

930
00:56:18,008 --> 00:56:20,142
Would you care to sit down?

931
00:56:20,143 --> 00:56:23,272
No... sir.

932
00:56:23,347 --> 00:56:25,111
Okay.

933
00:56:27,818 --> 00:56:29,343
You going to just stand there?

934
00:56:38,962 --> 00:56:41,090
Hey, hey, hey, speak English.

935
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:50,806
Porco? What's that, pork?

936
00:56:50,807 --> 00:56:52,708
Pig?

937
00:57:00,817 --> 00:57:02,149
Dispatch!

938
00:57:03,587 --> 00:57:05,588
Dispatch!

939
00:57:05,589 --> 00:57:07,790
This is dispatch.

940
00:57:07,791 --> 00:57:09,759
Route me to Trieste, all right?

941
00:57:09,760 --> 00:57:12,161
Arrange for a doctor with supplies.

942
00:57:12,162 --> 00:57:12,996
Mr.Tierney,

943
00:57:12,997 --> 00:57:14,965
where do you want him?

944
00:57:15,032 --> 00:57:16,728
I'll let you know.

945
00:57:30,681 --> 00:57:32,848
Global News Network, Munich.

946
00:57:32,849 --> 00:57:36,115
International Affairs Producer.

947
00:57:37,587 --> 00:57:39,655
International, Halloran.

948
00:57:39,656 --> 00:57:41,557
I want you to know that

949
00:57:41,558 --> 00:57:43,592
they have been hiding the facts.

950
00:57:43,593 --> 00:57:49,131
Freight 4402 is carrying a nuclear
bomb.

951
00:57:49,132 --> 00:57:50,800
Who is this?

952
00:57:50,801 --> 00:57:52,599
I'll call again.

953
00:57:54,237 --> 00:57:57,867
You're not going to believe this. Guys?

954
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,312
Cream, no sugar.

955
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,009
Mmm. Mm-hmm.

956
00:58:07,217 --> 00:58:08,884
Philpott.- Malcolm.

957
00:58:08,885 --> 00:58:10,513
Sir.-C.W., hang on.

958
00:58:10,587 --> 00:58:12,488
It's GNN... they want to know

959
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,082
if there's a bomb on the train.

960
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:15,958
Just cover it up.

961
00:58:15,959 --> 00:58:17,960
Yes, C.W., sorry.

962
00:58:17,961 --> 00:58:20,029
Leitzig's wavering... I asked him

963
00:58:20,030 --> 00:58:22,064
about the possibility of two bombs.

964
00:58:22,065 --> 00:58:23,232
I'm playing hardball.

965
00:58:23,233 --> 00:58:24,934
It could backfire.

966
00:58:24,935 --> 00:58:27,063
Yeah.

967
00:58:32,309 --> 00:58:33,800
Hey!

968
00:58:39,583 --> 00:58:41,449
Help! Help!

969
00:58:57,100 --> 00:59:00,703
Get a doctor! Now!

970
00:59:00,704 --> 00:59:02,639
Don't you die, you son of a...

971
00:59:08,945 --> 00:59:11,141
Damn!

972
00:59:16,353 --> 00:59:18,721
Help's comin', Franz.

973
00:59:18,722 --> 00:59:21,323
There is no such number.

974
00:59:21,324 --> 00:59:22,858
Please consult

975
00:59:22,859 --> 00:59:23,893
your international operator.

976
00:59:23,894 --> 00:59:25,694
Oh, man.

977
00:59:25,695 --> 00:59:27,830
Benin gave us a bogus number.

978
00:59:27,831 --> 00:59:29,865
I can't even call out.

979
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,001
He's left us to die.

980
00:59:32,002 --> 00:59:34,130
You're not going to die.

981
01:00:00,764 --> 01:00:03,032
No! Huh-uh! No!

982
01:00:03,033 --> 01:00:06,202
He's too young! Get me an old guy,

983
01:00:06,203 --> 01:00:10,106
a real old guy. I want a doctor.

984
01:00:10,107 --> 01:00:10,974
Come on.

985
01:00:10,975 --> 01:00:12,943
So much for an agent on board.

986
01:00:17,881 --> 01:00:20,382
You make me wait five minutes,

987
01:00:20,383 --> 01:00:21,417
and I kill this man.

988
01:00:21,418 --> 01:00:24,019
What are your demands?

989
01:00:24,020 --> 01:00:25,955
Cooperation!

990
01:00:26,022 --> 01:00:27,022
Is there a nuclear bomb

991
01:00:27,023 --> 01:00:27,956
on the train?

992
01:00:28,024 --> 01:00:29,992
Where's the goddamn doctor?

993
01:00:29,993 --> 01:00:31,655
Is there a bomb?

994
01:00:37,501 --> 01:00:39,001
Would you like to make

995
01:00:39,002 --> 01:00:40,369
a statement?

996
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,704
Go on.

997
01:00:41,705 --> 01:00:43,839
What group do you represent?

998
01:00:43,840 --> 01:00:46,775
When will you release the hostages?

999
01:00:46,776 --> 01:00:49,178
Is it true you are Red Brigade?

1000
01:00:49,179 --> 01:00:51,147
Aren't you American?

1001
01:00:51,148 --> 01:00:52,948
Stop! Stop right there.

1002
01:00:52,949 --> 01:00:53,917
Open your coat.

1003
01:00:57,754 --> 01:00:59,488
All right.

1004
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:01,788
Do you have a nuc...

1005
01:01:08,131 --> 01:01:10,032
As the siege of hijacked

1006
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:12,067
German train 4402 continues,

1007
01:01:12,068 --> 01:01:13,936
the question of how to deal

1008
01:01:13,937 --> 01:01:15,371
with an increasingly desperate

1009
01:01:15,372 --> 01:01:17,406
situation remains unanswered.

1010
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:18,474
The identity of the hijackers

1011
01:01:18,475 --> 01:01:20,444
is unclear, but reports confirm

1012
01:01:20,510 --> 01:01:22,244
at least one of the killers

1013
01:01:22,245 --> 01:01:23,279
is an American.

1014
01:01:23,280 --> 01:01:24,280
One German hostage

1015
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:25,748
has managed to escape...

1016
01:01:25,749 --> 01:01:27,945
Karl, why the hell did you do this?

1017
01:01:30,120 --> 01:01:34,256
Benin promised unlimited money

1018
01:01:34,257 --> 01:01:36,226
if I made him a bomb.

1019
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:38,194
It was an excuse,

1020
01:01:38,195 --> 01:01:40,629
and I used it as an excuse,

1021
01:01:40,630 --> 01:01:42,498
just to see if I could do it.

1022
01:01:42,499 --> 01:01:46,402
But then, he demanded another
bomb,

1023
01:01:46,403 --> 01:01:48,737
and that's when I was irradiated

1024
01:01:48,738 --> 01:01:50,773
by his inferior equipment.

1025
01:01:50,774 --> 01:01:52,741
Did you finish the second one?

1026
01:01:52,742 --> 01:01:54,472
Yes.

1027
01:01:57,681 --> 01:01:59,650
Who is this Benin?

1028
01:02:01,017 --> 01:02:03,352
General Konstantin Benin.

1029
01:02:03,353 --> 01:02:05,120
It was he who sent the killer.

1030
01:02:05,121 --> 01:02:06,956
And where is he now?

1031
01:02:06,957 --> 01:02:10,125
I don't know, but get him

1032
01:02:10,126 --> 01:02:13,392
and I will tell you anything.-Yeah.

1033
01:02:26,009 --> 01:02:28,744
What?! No, English! English!

1034
01:02:28,745 --> 01:02:32,546
He'll die unless he gets full
medical care.

1035
01:02:34,584 --> 01:02:38,420
Alex, I want... I want off.

1036
01:02:38,421 --> 01:02:41,724
No. No, no, stay. I need you.

1037
01:02:41,725 --> 01:02:44,991
No, not if I won't drive.

1038
01:02:47,197 --> 01:02:49,792
Mr. Tierney?- Patch him up!

1039
01:02:50,867 --> 01:02:52,301
What?!

1040
01:02:52,302 --> 01:02:54,203
I've just talked to my people,

1041
01:02:54,204 --> 01:02:56,173
and we can offer you a deal.

1042
01:02:57,641 --> 01:03:00,076
Yeah, right.- Now listen...

1043
01:03:01,811 --> 01:03:04,110
You're about to cross into Slovenia,

1044
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,115
and you haven't committed

1045
01:03:05,115 --> 01:03:06,083
any crimes there.

1046
01:03:06,149 --> 01:03:07,283
So just give up,

1047
01:03:07,284 --> 01:03:09,185
and they will let you walk.

1048
01:03:14,858 --> 01:03:16,859
Thank you so much for your concern,

1049
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:18,795
Malcolm, but I don't think so.

1050
01:03:18,895 --> 01:03:20,955
But really, thank you for offering.

1051
01:03:21,064 --> 01:03:25,160
Mr.Tierney, you stay on that train,

1052
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,464
you're a dead man.

1053
01:03:44,154 --> 01:03:46,155
So how'd you get to be

1054
01:03:46,156 --> 01:03:48,088
such a crackerjack shot?

1055
01:03:49,359 --> 01:03:50,918
Do you really care?

1056
01:03:51,027 --> 01:03:53,258
I bet you were army.

1057
01:03:53,330 --> 01:03:56,357
Biathlon... skiing and shooting...

1058
01:03:56,466 --> 01:03:58,094
For the US Olympic team.

1059
01:03:58,201 --> 01:04:01,831
We get a medal?- Bronze.

1060
01:04:01,938 --> 01:04:04,533
Oooh-eee. You going again?

1061
01:04:04,641 --> 01:04:07,702
No, I have another career now.

1062
01:04:07,811 --> 01:04:10,212
Uh-huh, what's that?

1063
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:12,581
Sergei, are Russian men

1064
01:04:12,582 --> 01:04:15,552
as narrow, rude and charmless

1065
01:04:15,618 --> 01:04:16,885
as our redneck

1066
01:04:16,886 --> 01:04:17,854
gentleman farmer here?

1067
01:04:17,954 --> 01:04:20,082
Redneck? What is redneck?

1068
01:04:20,190 --> 01:04:21,790
Hey, I was only getting some

1069
01:04:21,791 --> 01:04:22,759
background information on you.

1070
01:04:22,859 --> 01:04:25,327
If I'd asked him the same questions,

1071
01:04:25,328 --> 01:04:26,296
would have he got into such a tizzy?

1072
01:04:26,396 --> 01:04:27,863
I know that Philpott thinks you're

1073
01:04:27,864 --> 01:04:29,730
great, but I can't imagine why.

1074
01:04:29,833 --> 01:04:30,833
Well, Sabrina,

1075
01:04:30,834 --> 01:04:32,803
that's why you ain't boss.

1076
01:04:36,740 --> 01:04:39,471
Hey, come on, I'm only kidding.

1077
01:04:40,777 --> 01:04:43,212
Mike, I saved your ass in that boxcar.

1078
01:04:43,213 --> 01:04:45,011
That you did.

1079
01:04:45,115 --> 01:04:46,548
But I bet before this gig's over,

1080
01:04:46,549 --> 01:04:48,584
I repay the compliment.

1081
01:04:48,585 --> 01:04:50,519
God, you are so arrogant.

1082
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,653
Hey, remember...

1083
01:04:51,654 --> 01:04:53,623
Only the young die good.

1084
01:05:02,565 --> 01:05:03,133
Philpott.

1085
01:05:03,134 --> 01:05:05,102
Leitzig's confirmed it.

1086
01:05:05,201 --> 01:05:06,869
He made two bombs, both

1087
01:05:06,870 --> 01:05:08,463
for a General Konstantin Benin.

1088
01:05:08,571 --> 01:05:08,905
Good. Good work, Doctor.

1089
01:05:08,906 --> 01:05:10,806
Thank you.

1090
01:05:17,247 --> 01:05:20,445
Dispatch, I want Belgrade.

1091
01:05:23,153 --> 01:05:25,179
Switching to Belgrade.

1092
01:05:25,288 --> 01:05:26,288
That routes you

1093
01:05:26,289 --> 01:05:27,655
through Slovenia.

1094
01:05:29,292 --> 01:05:30,659
Good news, bad news.

1095
01:05:30,660 --> 01:05:32,288
We're all on headsets, sir.

1096
01:05:32,395 --> 01:05:34,364
There are two devices... two.

1097
01:05:34,464 --> 01:05:35,731
We don't know where the second one

1098
01:05:35,732 --> 01:05:37,701
is. It's probably not on the train.

1099
01:05:37,801 --> 01:05:39,429
Any change in plans?

1100
01:05:39,536 --> 01:05:40,903
I think that Tierney

1101
01:05:40,904 --> 01:05:41,872
is considering our deal.

1102
01:05:41,971 --> 01:05:43,338
Now keep following the train,

1103
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:44,637
but give him room.

1104
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,241
Philpott out.

1105
01:05:46,242 --> 01:05:48,768
Sir... Yolanda on the coded phone.

1106
01:05:48,878 --> 01:05:50,608
Ms. Sanchez.

1107
01:05:50,713 --> 01:05:53,012
Every Russian officer authorized

1108
01:05:53,116 --> 01:05:55,083
to use that weapons account

1109
01:05:55,084 --> 01:05:56,118
checked out... except one.

1110
01:05:56,119 --> 01:05:57,820
Now let me guess...

1111
01:05:57,821 --> 01:05:59,790
General Konstantin Benin.

1112
01:05:59,889 --> 01:06:02,757
Right.- Where's Benin now?

1113
01:06:02,826 --> 01:06:04,860
Nobody knows, not even the Russians.

1114
01:06:04,861 --> 01:06:07,126
Thank you, Ms. Sanchez.

1115
01:06:33,122 --> 01:06:34,818
That's it.

1116
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:45,058
Men's room.

1117
01:06:47,303 --> 01:06:49,137
The death train continues

1118
01:06:49,138 --> 01:06:50,106
its mysterious path...

1119
01:06:50,173 --> 01:06:51,698
Mmm, what's on your mind?

1120
01:06:52,775 --> 01:06:54,543
We were wondering,

1121
01:06:54,544 --> 01:06:55,512
does Tierney know

1122
01:06:55,578 --> 01:06:56,912
that the gadget might have

1123
01:06:56,913 --> 01:06:57,946
a remote detonator?

1124
01:06:57,947 --> 01:07:00,849
Well, it's worth tossing around.

1125
01:07:00,850 --> 01:07:01,651
With all the bashing

1126
01:07:01,652 --> 01:07:02,684
he's been taking,

1127
01:07:02,685 --> 01:07:04,677
he must be pretty well roasted by now.

1128
01:07:04,754 --> 01:07:05,821
All right, well, you keep

1129
01:07:05,822 --> 01:07:07,856
playing the mind games

1130
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:09,858
and we'll tail him through Slovenia.

1131
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,589
Will do.- Uh-huh.

1132
01:08:06,249 --> 01:08:07,150
Public Affairs.

1133
01:08:07,151 --> 01:08:09,119
It's Sabrina. Run this number.

1134
01:08:11,421 --> 01:08:13,655
It's from a payphone in Zagreb.

1135
01:08:13,656 --> 01:08:14,690
Got it.

1136
01:08:14,691 --> 01:08:16,558
Find out the last number called...

1137
01:08:16,559 --> 01:08:18,594
Rodenko was the one who made it.

1138
01:08:18,595 --> 01:08:21,663
A private call?-Yes.

1139
01:08:21,664 --> 01:08:24,031
I got to go, okay? Thanks, bye.

1140
01:08:51,394 --> 01:08:52,828
Freight 4402 remains

1141
01:08:52,829 --> 01:08:54,196
somewhat of a mystery.

1142
01:08:54,197 --> 01:08:55,831
Thinking of quitting?

1143
01:08:55,832 --> 01:08:57,130
No, I'm on course.

1144
01:08:57,200 --> 01:08:58,667
Rodenko tells me you're

1145
01:08:58,668 --> 01:08:59,701
negotiating with the police.

1146
01:08:59,702 --> 01:09:01,136
Fuck you, you commie sack of shit.

1147
01:09:01,137 --> 01:09:03,171
You're dumpin' out on me.

1148
01:09:03,172 --> 01:09:04,406
I can't even call you.

1149
01:09:04,407 --> 01:09:05,440
What's your phone number?

1150
01:09:05,441 --> 01:09:07,109
That's for security. Now

1151
01:09:07,110 --> 01:09:08,143
you stay loyal, you understand?

1152
01:09:08,144 --> 01:09:09,277
What's your goddamn

1153
01:09:09,278 --> 01:09:10,246
phone number?

1154
01:09:19,389 --> 01:09:21,824
Hey, drive this thing! Drive it!

1155
01:09:27,697 --> 01:09:30,132
- What?!
- Mr.Tierney...

1156
01:09:30,133 --> 01:09:32,267
Screw you.

1157
01:09:32,268 --> 01:09:33,169
I was just wondering,

1158
01:09:33,170 --> 01:09:36,004
did you know that your bomb

1159
01:09:36,005 --> 01:09:37,205
could be detonated by remote?

1160
01:09:37,206 --> 01:09:39,175
Just a phone call.

1161
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:44,446
If we knew who was behind this,

1162
01:09:44,447 --> 01:09:47,110
we could block any incoming call.

1163
01:09:50,920 --> 01:09:53,021
But I'd like to bet that you can't

1164
01:09:53,022 --> 01:09:54,991
take that bomb off the hook.

1165
01:10:03,766 --> 01:10:05,462
Halloran, please.

1166
01:10:08,471 --> 01:10:10,238
Halloran.

1167
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,174
The bomb... it is a 3-kilogram

1168
01:10:12,241 --> 01:10:13,942
plutonium construction.

1169
01:10:13,943 --> 01:10:15,210
The plutonium was stolen from

1170
01:10:15,211 --> 01:10:17,179
the Norton nuclear power plant

1171
01:10:17,180 --> 01:10:18,180
by Dr. Karl Leitzig,

1172
01:10:18,181 --> 01:10:19,881
who also built the bomb.

1173
01:10:19,882 --> 01:10:23,151
It is on Freight 4402.

1174
01:10:23,152 --> 01:10:24,653
I will reveal its destination

1175
01:10:24,654 --> 01:10:25,687
in due course.

1176
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:27,389
Hey, who is this?

1177
01:10:27,390 --> 01:10:28,957
Are the facts clear?

1178
01:10:28,958 --> 01:10:30,927
Yeah, I got 'em.

1179
01:10:41,838 --> 01:10:45,775
Hey, Captain Crunch, take us closer.

1180
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,409
What are you doing?- Evaluating.

1181
01:11:04,060 --> 01:11:07,295
We will all die sometime.

1182
01:11:07,296 --> 01:11:11,399
Oh, Karl, Karl... give me a break.

1183
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:14,169
We're trying to save lives here.

1184
01:11:14,170 --> 01:11:16,671
Very well.

1185
01:11:16,672 --> 01:11:17,973
The most difficult thing

1186
01:11:17,974 --> 01:11:20,008
is the nuclear trigger.

1187
01:11:20,009 --> 01:11:23,044
My hardest task was to make sure

1188
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:24,846
that they produce an absolutely

1189
01:11:24,847 --> 01:11:26,882
symmetrical detonation.

1190
01:11:26,883 --> 01:11:29,451
General Benin got the triggers.

1191
01:11:29,452 --> 01:11:31,052
They were 1990s

1192
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,420
Soviet designs, yeah?

1193
01:11:32,421 --> 01:11:34,890
And that keypad...

1194
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,925
Enters the detonation code.

1195
01:11:36,926 --> 01:11:40,095
And after one minute... poof.

1196
01:11:40,096 --> 01:11:43,098
It is irreversible.

1197
01:11:43,099 --> 01:11:44,566
Once the bomb starts,

1198
01:11:44,567 --> 01:11:46,536
only I can stop it.

1199
01:11:46,602 --> 01:11:48,370
So how do you disable

1200
01:11:48,371 --> 01:11:49,404
those triggers?

1201
01:11:49,405 --> 01:11:50,539
Dr. Whitlock,

1202
01:11:50,540 --> 01:11:53,575
I must save something...

1203
01:11:53,576 --> 01:11:54,743
Otherwise you will

1204
01:11:54,744 --> 01:11:55,777
just leave me to die.

1205
01:11:55,778 --> 01:11:57,546
A bomb on the train? GNN's

1206
01:11:57,547 --> 01:11:59,516
Roger Flint reports from Italy.

1207
01:11:59,582 --> 01:12:02,083
Unconfirmed reports have

1208
01:12:02,084 --> 01:12:03,118
suddenly escalated the situation

1209
01:12:03,119 --> 01:12:04,553
on hijacked Freight 4402,

1210
01:12:04,554 --> 01:12:06,588
now in Slovenia.

1211
01:12:06,589 --> 01:12:09,024
GNN believes there is a homemade

1212
01:12:09,025 --> 01:12:11,059
nuclear bomb on board the train.

1213
01:12:11,060 --> 01:12:14,362
All right, no one's screwing with us.

1214
01:12:14,363 --> 01:12:18,066
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1215
01:12:18,067 --> 01:12:19,001
The actual construction

1216
01:12:19,002 --> 01:12:20,035
of the bomb seems

1217
01:12:20,036 --> 01:12:21,036
to have been carried out

1218
01:12:21,037 --> 01:12:22,304
somewhere in Germany.

1219
01:12:22,305 --> 01:12:26,208
Well, that changes the game.

1220
01:12:26,209 --> 01:12:28,343
Sir, they've pinpointed the number

1221
01:12:28,344 --> 01:12:30,078
of the payphone call

1222
01:12:30,079 --> 01:12:31,112
Sabrina sent in... Munich.

1223
01:12:31,113 --> 01:12:33,181
Rodenko called Munich?-Yeah.

1224
01:12:33,182 --> 01:12:34,916
It's a cellular listed

1225
01:12:34,917 --> 01:12:36,886
to Blumen aus Deutschland.

1226
01:12:36,953 --> 01:12:38,286
No exact address.

1227
01:12:38,287 --> 01:12:39,915
Tell the Munich police.

1228
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,427
How long are we going

1229
01:12:45,428 --> 01:12:47,397
to follow this maniac?

1230
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:53,902
Until we're ordered otherwise.

1231
01:12:53,903 --> 01:12:56,972
I don't think Sir Philpott

1232
01:12:56,973 --> 01:12:59,007
is capable of making a decision.

1233
01:12:59,008 --> 01:13:00,203
But you are?

1234
01:13:02,278 --> 01:13:04,346
UNACO chopper, Philpott here.

1235
01:13:04,347 --> 01:13:06,715
People, how are we holding up?

1236
01:13:06,716 --> 01:13:08,912
Oh, just peachy.

1237
01:13:10,319 --> 01:13:13,255
Sir, out in the field it is apparent

1238
01:13:13,256 --> 01:13:14,823
we need to make

1239
01:13:14,824 --> 01:13:15,857
a more aggressive stance.

1240
01:13:15,858 --> 01:13:17,859
Oh, Ms. Carver, that call

1241
01:13:17,860 --> 01:13:20,362
you made proved to be unfriendly.

1242
01:13:20,363 --> 01:13:21,956
Got it.

1243
01:13:22,031 --> 01:13:24,466
Good hunting. Philpott out.

1244
01:13:28,771 --> 01:13:31,139
Kolchinsky...

1245
01:13:31,140 --> 01:13:34,167
land us on the roof
of the last car... now!

1246
01:13:36,178 --> 01:13:38,280
They'll kill us, Rodenko!

1247
01:13:38,281 --> 01:13:39,249
They won't kill me.

1248
01:13:43,753 --> 01:13:45,520
Do it!

1249
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,990
- No! No!
- Next time I'll kill you!

1250
01:14:06,042 --> 01:14:07,943
Nail him!

1251
01:14:07,944 --> 01:14:10,175
Okay.

1252
01:14:15,184 --> 01:14:17,252
Kolchinsky. Kolchinsky!

1253
01:14:17,253 --> 01:14:19,779
He's unconscious.- Holy shit!

1254
01:14:21,123 --> 01:14:21,724
Now what? Can you fly

1255
01:14:21,725 --> 01:14:23,758
one of these things, too?

1256
01:14:23,759 --> 01:14:25,728
That one.-What, this one?

1257
01:14:28,898 --> 01:14:32,133
Oh God, I guess not.

1258
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,968
Come on, Crunch, come on!

1259
01:14:36,472 --> 01:14:38,907
Come on, Crunch, wake up!

1260
01:14:40,176 --> 01:14:42,143
Mike! Pedals, Mike!

1261
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:43,703
I'm pedaling, Crunch, I'm pedaling.

1262
01:14:44,914 --> 01:14:46,348
Crunch, come on, man.

1263
01:14:46,349 --> 01:14:47,317
Okay, you're okay.

1264
01:14:48,384 --> 01:14:50,518
Stay with me. Stay with me.

1265
01:14:50,519 --> 01:14:51,619
Crunch, come on! Come on.

1266
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:53,589
You're okay! You're okay.

1267
01:15:06,102 --> 01:15:09,072
You got it?-You bet.

1268
01:15:37,767 --> 01:15:40,702
This is to record my intentions,

1269
01:15:40,703 --> 01:15:43,605
should I fail or should I die.

1270
01:15:45,808 --> 01:15:48,610
My name is General Konstantin Benin

1271
01:15:48,611 --> 01:15:51,513
of the former Soviet Union.

1272
01:15:51,514 --> 01:15:54,916
The hijacking of Freight 4402

1273
01:15:55,017 --> 01:15:57,987
was my doing.

1274
01:15:58,087 --> 01:16:00,147
The building of a nuclear bomb

1275
01:16:00,256 --> 01:16:02,691
was my plan.

1276
01:16:02,792 --> 01:16:06,820
It was not my intention to arm Iraq.

1277
01:16:06,929 --> 01:16:08,930
It was my intention

1278
01:16:08,931 --> 01:16:11,399
to revive the Soviet Union.

1279
01:16:11,400 --> 01:16:15,895
When the last coup failed, nerve failed.

1280
01:16:16,005 --> 01:16:18,506
But when the world hears

1281
01:16:18,507 --> 01:16:20,508
that a nuclear bomb is

1282
01:16:20,509 --> 01:16:22,478
in the hands of Iraq fanatics,

1283
01:16:22,578 --> 01:16:24,579
then the Russian army

1284
01:16:24,580 --> 01:16:27,049
will be forced to invade

1285
01:16:27,149 --> 01:16:28,516
to recover the bomb

1286
01:16:28,517 --> 01:16:30,145
for Russian security.

1287
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:34,556
And then, with our army mobilized,

1288
01:16:34,557 --> 01:16:37,527
our nerve will not fail

1289
01:16:37,626 --> 01:16:41,188
and there will be a new union...

1290
01:16:41,297 --> 01:16:44,927
A military union.

1291
01:17:00,616 --> 01:17:02,551
What are they doing?

1292
01:17:02,651 --> 01:17:04,643
Don't you know I've got the bomb?

1293
01:17:04,720 --> 01:17:07,246
We've got the bomb.

1294
01:17:08,924 --> 01:17:10,517
I know the code.

1295
01:17:10,626 --> 01:17:12,093
I can blow us all to hell.

1296
01:17:12,094 --> 01:17:13,128
You want proof?

1297
01:17:13,129 --> 01:17:14,996
I can blow us all to hell!

1298
01:17:14,997 --> 01:17:15,965
Alex, they believe you!

1299
01:17:19,435 --> 01:17:21,370
They damn sure will.

1300
01:17:26,142 --> 01:17:27,906
Hey, Philpott.

1301
01:17:29,812 --> 01:17:31,713
Dispatch.

1302
01:17:33,249 --> 01:17:34,016
This is Philpott.

1303
01:17:34,016 --> 01:17:34,984
What about my offer?

1304
01:17:35,084 --> 01:17:37,576
No, listen, this is my demand.

1305
01:17:37,686 --> 01:17:39,287
I want everybody on Earth to know

1306
01:17:39,288 --> 01:17:40,622
that I've got this bomb,

1307
01:17:40,623 --> 01:17:42,319
so here's what you're going to do...

1308
01:17:42,424 --> 01:17:44,416
You get GNN.

1309
01:17:44,527 --> 01:17:47,122
I want GNN on this train,

1310
01:17:47,229 --> 01:17:48,429
and we'll show the world

1311
01:17:48,430 --> 01:17:49,398
that I'm not bluffing.

1312
01:17:49,498 --> 01:17:50,132
Okay?

1313
01:17:50,133 --> 01:17:52,101
GNN? You mean a reporter?

1314
01:17:52,201 --> 01:17:54,202
Yeah... that curly-haired dude,

1315
01:17:54,203 --> 01:17:56,536
that cocky guy, whats-his-name?

1316
01:17:58,207 --> 01:17:59,574
By the awesome destructive

1317
01:17:59,575 --> 01:18:01,203
power of nuclear weapons.

1318
01:18:01,310 --> 01:18:03,905
Roger Flint?- Roger Flint, right.

1319
01:18:04,013 --> 01:18:06,447
I want Roger Flint on the train.

1320
01:18:06,448 --> 01:18:07,416
I'll pick him up in Belgrade.

1321
01:18:11,487 --> 01:18:13,046
Roger Flint.

1322
01:18:14,790 --> 01:18:16,157
No, he never saw me.

1323
01:18:16,158 --> 01:18:17,126
First I had on the gas mask,

1324
01:18:17,226 --> 01:18:18,160
and then in the tunnel

1325
01:18:18,160 --> 01:18:19,128
it was too dark.

1326
01:18:19,195 --> 01:18:20,695
All right. GNN's Roger Flint

1327
01:18:20,696 --> 01:18:22,460
has agreed to do it

1328
01:18:22,565 --> 01:18:24,124
as long as he gets an exclusive.

1329
01:18:24,233 --> 01:18:24,833
And so, Ms. Carver, you are

1330
01:18:24,834 --> 01:18:26,802
to be his camerama... person.

1331
01:18:26,902 --> 01:18:28,234
Philpott out.

1332
01:18:28,337 --> 01:18:29,337
Ms. Yamamuro, what's the word

1333
01:18:29,338 --> 01:18:30,636
on Benin's phone line?

1334
01:18:30,739 --> 01:18:31,739
Munich police have a good lead.

1335
01:18:31,740 --> 01:18:33,299
We need more than that.

1336
01:18:34,410 --> 01:18:36,106
You know about video cameras?

1337
01:18:36,212 --> 01:18:37,942
How hard could it be?

1338
01:18:38,047 --> 01:18:40,676
Hi. You Pierre?- Ah.

1339
01:18:40,783 --> 01:18:42,417
Mike Graham. This thing

1340
01:18:42,418 --> 01:18:43,785
still gonna take pictures?

1341
01:18:43,786 --> 01:18:46,984
Certainly. You get one shot.

1342
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:48,580
It's for me.

1343
01:18:50,159 --> 01:18:52,025
Just one?

1344
01:18:52,127 --> 01:18:54,995
Best we can do if you want video.

1345
01:18:56,665 --> 01:18:59,658
Stealth video... yeah.

1346
01:18:59,768 --> 01:19:02,328
As I wait for the approaching train,

1347
01:19:02,404 --> 01:19:04,639
I can say that I have never

1348
01:19:04,640 --> 01:19:05,608
covered a story like this.

1349
01:19:05,708 --> 01:19:07,768
Yugoslav army troops stand ready

1350
01:19:07,876 --> 01:19:09,277
should the hijackers

1351
01:19:09,278 --> 01:19:10,311
provoke an armed response.

1352
01:19:10,312 --> 01:19:12,013
Though I've been assured that

1353
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:13,983
due to the delicate nature of...

1354
01:19:18,520 --> 01:19:19,787
Jeez, what did you step in,

1355
01:19:19,788 --> 01:19:20,822
Crunch?

1356
01:19:20,823 --> 01:19:22,890
I hear it.

1357
01:19:22,891 --> 01:19:24,459
Just quit flickin'

1358
01:19:24,460 --> 01:19:25,428
your foot around, all right?

1359
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:26,527
She'll be comin'

1360
01:19:26,528 --> 01:19:27,695
around the mountain

1361
01:19:27,696 --> 01:19:28,530
She'll be comin' around

1362
01:19:28,531 --> 01:19:30,231
the mountain, when she comes...

1363
01:19:30,232 --> 01:19:32,934
Now release the vacuum advance

1364
01:19:32,935 --> 01:19:34,969
in number two cylinder.

1365
01:19:34,970 --> 01:19:37,496
Right, I got it.

1366
01:19:39,775 --> 01:19:42,143
He's coming in too fast.

1367
01:19:42,144 --> 01:19:44,012
Here it comes.

1368
01:19:44,013 --> 01:19:45,980
Freight 4402, approaching us now

1369
01:19:45,981 --> 01:19:47,950
at Belgrade Station.

1370
01:19:50,552 --> 01:19:52,020
It appears to be having

1371
01:19:52,021 --> 01:19:52,989
difficulty stopping.

1372
01:19:53,055 --> 01:19:55,286
Brake. Brake harder.

1373
01:19:59,028 --> 01:20:01,691
Yeah, I can drive this thing.

1374
01:20:19,481 --> 01:20:21,282
The hijackers are motioning us

1375
01:20:21,283 --> 01:20:22,317
toward the locomotive.

1376
01:20:22,318 --> 01:20:25,086
I can see Dr. Serafal Menigen

1377
01:20:25,087 --> 01:20:27,121
held at gunpoint by Alex Tierney.

1378
01:20:27,122 --> 01:20:30,058
I recognize you.- I'm Roger Flint.

1379
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:32,528
Right, Roger Flint, GNN.

1380
01:20:34,296 --> 01:20:35,662
Who's that?

1381
01:20:40,269 --> 01:20:42,238
Lois Dobbs, GNN video.

1382
01:20:45,541 --> 01:20:47,305
Come on.

1383
01:20:50,646 --> 01:20:52,945
Right, she's on board. Go, go!

1384
01:21:04,026 --> 01:21:07,028
All aboard underneath.- Splendid.

1385
01:21:07,029 --> 01:21:09,897
Go on, it's in there. Watch your head.

1386
01:21:11,767 --> 01:21:13,702
Crunch, you okay?-Yeah.

1387
01:21:15,504 --> 01:21:16,405
I thought you wanted

1388
01:21:16,406 --> 01:21:17,438
to show your bomb.

1389
01:21:17,439 --> 01:21:19,374
Shut up! Keep moving. It's in there.

1390
01:21:29,385 --> 01:21:32,321
It's right here, Roger. Fine, good.

1391
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,457
Is that on?- Not yet. Roger?

1392
01:21:36,458 --> 01:21:37,292
Turn it on. Get this is the shot.

1393
01:21:37,293 --> 01:21:39,660
You got this in the shot?

1394
01:21:39,661 --> 01:21:41,220
Yes, sir.

1395
01:21:45,467 --> 01:21:46,901
And we hope, within moments,

1396
01:21:46,902 --> 01:21:48,603
to uplink with Roger Flint

1397
01:21:48,604 --> 01:21:50,937
live aboard Freight 4402.

1398
01:22:08,891 --> 01:22:11,025
I'm set.- All right, good. Go ahead.

1399
01:22:11,026 --> 01:22:13,495
You ready to uplink, Lois?-Yes, sir.

1400
01:22:13,562 --> 01:22:17,999
Okay. Three, two, one.

1401
01:22:18,000 --> 01:22:20,835
We are now inside Freight 4402,

1402
01:22:20,836 --> 01:22:22,437
heading southeast.

1403
01:22:22,438 --> 01:22:23,938
Next to me is AlexTierney,

1404
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:25,703
leader of the hijackers.

1405
01:22:29,077 --> 01:22:30,945
Our Geiger counter confirms...

1406
01:22:30,946 --> 01:22:32,574
Look at Tierney.

1407
01:22:32,648 --> 01:22:33,582
Radioactive material

1408
01:22:33,583 --> 01:22:36,211
within this ominous steel box.

1409
01:22:39,688 --> 01:22:41,556
I'd speculate that the guarded

1410
01:22:41,557 --> 01:22:43,591
nature of law enforcement...

1411
01:22:43,592 --> 01:22:45,159
Whatever! Hello, world,

1412
01:22:45,160 --> 01:22:47,195
this is "Mondo" Tierney.

1413
01:22:47,196 --> 01:22:49,358
I have the bomb...

1414
01:22:52,434 --> 01:22:55,403
and I'm prepared to blow myself up

1415
01:22:55,404 --> 01:22:57,505
before being taken prisoner.

1416
01:22:57,506 --> 01:23:00,141
Now, I'm not insane,

1417
01:23:00,142 --> 01:23:02,243
and I'm not acting alone.

1418
01:23:02,244 --> 01:23:04,145
This is a covert operation

1419
01:23:04,146 --> 01:23:05,114
designed to rein...

1420
01:23:07,182 --> 01:23:11,052
rein...

1421
01:23:11,053 --> 01:23:13,215
Yes!
Rein...

1422
01:23:16,091 --> 01:23:18,356
Tierney's hit!

1423
01:23:21,296 --> 01:23:22,958
Get down!

1424
01:23:32,741 --> 01:23:36,678
Crunch!- One man, up front.

1425
01:23:46,088 --> 01:23:47,755
Michael? Kolchinsky?

1426
01:23:47,756 --> 01:23:49,384
Are you there?

1427
01:23:53,595 --> 01:23:56,997
UNACO, come in! Anyone!

1428
01:24:11,380 --> 01:24:13,214
Sabrina?

1429
01:24:13,215 --> 01:24:15,883
Yeah, okay. We're okay.- Good.

1430
01:24:15,884 --> 01:24:16,418
Come in, Michael.

1431
01:24:16,419 --> 01:24:18,452
What's happening?

1432
01:24:18,453 --> 01:24:19,921
We're secure. We've got

1433
01:24:19,922 --> 01:24:21,622
some wounded down here.

1434
01:24:21,623 --> 01:24:22,757
Hurry with medical.

1435
01:24:22,758 --> 01:24:24,056
On its way, Michael.

1436
01:24:40,208 --> 01:24:42,376
Do svidanya,

1437
01:24:42,377 --> 01:24:44,107
Cowboys.

1438
01:24:53,288 --> 01:24:54,755
We've got a situation here...

1439
01:24:54,756 --> 01:24:56,791
The bomb's counting down.

1440
01:24:56,792 --> 01:24:57,693
C.W., I need

1441
01:24:57,694 --> 01:24:59,727
the defusing sequence now.

1442
01:24:59,728 --> 01:25:01,697
Karl, it's counting down.

1443
01:25:05,467 --> 01:25:07,902
Technical difficulties.

1444
01:25:30,292 --> 01:25:33,260
Need that sequence... no bull.

1445
01:25:33,261 --> 01:25:35,129
Karl, do you understand?

1446
01:25:35,130 --> 01:25:36,189
It's counting down.

1447
01:25:39,201 --> 01:25:41,397
In this order only.

1448
01:25:44,239 --> 01:25:46,574
Black, blue...

1449
01:25:46,575 --> 01:25:48,609
Malcolm... black, blue...

1450
01:25:48,610 --> 01:25:49,977
green, yellow...

1451
01:25:49,978 --> 01:25:51,846
green, yellow...- Black, blue...

1452
01:25:51,847 --> 01:25:55,875
25, 24, 23...- ...green, yellow...

1453
01:25:55,951 --> 01:25:59,453
22, 21, 20.

1454
01:25:59,454 --> 01:26:01,155
Orange.- ...orange.

1455
01:26:01,156 --> 01:26:02,556
Michael, orange.

1456
01:26:02,557 --> 01:26:04,258
I got that. There's two left.

1457
01:26:04,259 --> 01:26:07,752
Wait, wait. Orange...

1458
01:26:09,131 --> 01:26:11,032
white, red.

1459
01:26:11,033 --> 01:26:12,967
Karl, are you sure?- No.

1460
01:26:12,968 --> 01:26:14,168
Eight...

1461
01:26:14,169 --> 01:26:16,170
It's probably white and red.

1462
01:26:16,171 --> 01:26:17,571
Probably white and red.

1463
01:26:17,572 --> 01:26:18,939
Six, five...

1464
01:26:18,940 --> 01:26:22,900
four, three, two, one.

1465
01:26:38,727 --> 01:26:40,787
The camera working?

1466
01:26:46,168 --> 01:26:48,369
We are hoping to regain our uplink

1467
01:26:48,370 --> 01:26:49,770
with Roger Flint and his crew

1468
01:26:49,771 --> 01:26:51,069
inside the train.

1469
01:26:57,245 --> 01:26:59,013
Ah, we can see activity

1470
01:26:59,014 --> 01:27:00,715
outside one of the boxcars.

1471
01:27:00,716 --> 01:27:04,485
Michael, the glass is only half empty.

1472
01:27:04,486 --> 01:27:06,153
Oh, really, how's that?

1473
01:27:06,154 --> 01:27:08,155
Well, Benin's second bomb

1474
01:27:08,156 --> 01:27:10,157
needs your attention.

1475
01:27:10,158 --> 01:27:12,693
Now?- I can think of no better time.

1476
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:14,228
You and Ms. Carver will be

1477
01:27:14,229 --> 01:27:15,963
picked up in five minutes.

1478
01:27:15,964 --> 01:27:17,830
Destination: Munich.

1479
01:27:19,167 --> 01:27:22,569
Just peachy. Just peachy.

1480
01:27:22,671 --> 01:27:25,806
Come on, it's not that bad.- Okay?

1481
01:27:25,807 --> 01:27:27,708
You got two legs.

1482
01:27:27,809 --> 01:27:30,945
No longer a catastrophic threat,

1483
01:27:30,946 --> 01:27:33,114
no longer a rolling hell,

1484
01:27:33,115 --> 01:27:35,816
the death train waits, empty.

1485
01:27:35,817 --> 01:27:37,852
German railway officials...

1486
01:27:37,853 --> 01:27:40,054
Yes, thank you.

1487
01:27:40,055 --> 01:27:41,489
The phone company's completed

1488
01:27:41,490 --> 01:27:43,459
the tap on Benin's cellular.

1489
01:27:43,558 --> 01:27:45,359
Excellent.

1490
01:27:45,360 --> 01:27:48,162
One second from oblivion.

1491
01:27:48,163 --> 01:27:50,064
For every living thing within miles,

1492
01:27:50,065 --> 01:27:51,065
it came down

1493
01:27:51,066 --> 01:27:52,266
to that one critical second.

1494
01:27:52,267 --> 01:27:54,268
Authorities have just confirmed that

1495
01:27:54,269 --> 01:27:56,003
the bomb Karl Leitzig constructed

1496
01:27:56,004 --> 01:27:57,705
would have indeed detonated.

1497
01:27:57,706 --> 01:28:01,074
German craftsmanship.

1498
01:28:02,811 --> 01:28:05,804
Karl, what about the second bomb?

1499
01:28:05,914 --> 01:28:06,914
Estimates on loss

1500
01:28:06,915 --> 01:28:07,905
of life from the blast...

1501
01:28:08,016 --> 01:28:10,451
up to five million people.- Karl.

1502
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,619
And from the fallout

1503
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,653
and subsequent radiation...

1504
01:28:12,654 --> 01:28:14,789
another 20 million people.- Karl.

1505
01:28:14,790 --> 01:28:16,490
Many of those casualties

1506
01:28:16,491 --> 01:28:18,526
would have suffered burns...

1507
01:28:18,527 --> 01:28:20,428
blindness, and eventually, cancer.

1508
01:28:22,364 --> 01:28:24,492
Here we go. On speaker.

1509
01:28:26,168 --> 01:28:28,135
Iraq.

1510
01:28:28,136 --> 01:28:30,105
General, if you are watching GNN,

1511
01:28:30,205 --> 01:28:32,506
you know the second device is reliable.

1512
01:28:32,507 --> 01:28:34,875
My people in Iraq will take delivery.

1513
01:28:34,876 --> 01:28:36,577
Meet me at 34 Zendlinge Strasse

1514
01:28:36,578 --> 01:28:38,612
in one hour.

1515
01:28:38,613 --> 01:28:40,080
I will have it.

1516
01:28:40,081 --> 01:28:42,316
Signed, sealed and delivered.

1517
01:28:42,317 --> 01:28:44,618
Philpott calling UNACO 1.

1518
01:28:44,619 --> 01:28:46,821
UNACO 1, go ahead.

1519
01:28:46,822 --> 01:28:48,723
It's Philpott.

1520
01:28:48,790 --> 01:28:50,324
I'm faxing you a firm location

1521
01:28:50,325 --> 01:28:51,659
for Benin's exchange.

1522
01:28:51,660 --> 01:28:53,652
It's a residential district in Munich.

1523
01:28:53,762 --> 01:28:55,029
How'd you get it, sir?

1524
01:28:55,030 --> 01:28:56,063
Off Benin's cellular.

1525
01:28:56,064 --> 01:28:57,064
Munich police are covering.

1526
01:28:57,065 --> 01:28:58,089
You'll just make it.

1527
01:28:58,200 --> 01:29:00,465
Sir, he'd never do that.

1528
01:29:01,536 --> 01:29:03,103
I beg your pardon?

1529
01:29:03,104 --> 01:29:05,073
Benin knows we have his number.

1530
01:29:05,173 --> 01:29:06,766
It's got to be a bluff.

1531
01:29:06,875 --> 01:29:09,071
It's all we have. You just be there.

1532
01:29:12,881 --> 01:29:16,340
If I bought a bomb, I'd fly it out, fast.

1533
01:29:16,451 --> 01:29:18,420
Hmm, are you doubting the chief?

1534
01:29:18,520 --> 01:29:21,021
Raoul?-Yeah?

1535
01:29:21,022 --> 01:29:22,623
How many airports around Munich

1536
01:29:22,624 --> 01:29:23,592
can handle private jets?

1537
01:29:23,692 --> 01:29:25,820
Besides the international? One.

1538
01:29:25,927 --> 01:29:27,928
Let's go there.- Okay.

1539
01:29:27,929 --> 01:29:29,591
No way... no, no, no, no way.

1540
01:29:29,698 --> 01:29:31,758
Get permission.

1541
01:29:35,704 --> 01:29:38,299
Yeah, well, we're on a snipe hunt.

1542
01:29:38,406 --> 01:29:39,897
Snipe? What's that?

1543
01:29:40,008 --> 01:29:41,943
Damned if I know.

1544
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:42,744
10 years in Kentucky

1545
01:29:42,745 --> 01:29:44,713
and I never saw one.

1546
01:29:44,813 --> 01:29:46,146
You know, I remember...

1547
01:29:46,147 --> 01:29:47,181
I think it was Panama...

1548
01:29:47,182 --> 01:29:48,115
There was this hot-shot

1549
01:29:48,183 --> 01:29:49,183
lieutenant and he had...

1550
01:29:49,184 --> 01:29:51,119
Wait! Wait! Shhh, shh!

1551
01:29:56,324 --> 01:29:58,293
Well?

1552
01:29:58,393 --> 01:30:00,885
You were lucky.- I was smart.

1553
01:30:08,837 --> 01:30:10,104
That's a Russian uniform.

1554
01:30:10,105 --> 01:30:11,733
Uh-huh, uh-huh. Okay.

1555
01:30:26,955 --> 01:30:30,392
Raoul, patch me to Philpott.

1556
01:30:30,492 --> 01:30:33,961
Phil, remember that time in Argentina?

1557
01:30:33,962 --> 01:30:35,294
You found them!

1558
01:30:35,363 --> 01:30:36,864
Just like I said.

1559
01:30:36,865 --> 01:30:37,865
We're going to lay low

1560
01:30:37,866 --> 01:30:39,300
until we get backup, okay?

1561
01:30:39,401 --> 01:30:40,994
Give me your exact location.

1562
01:30:56,651 --> 01:30:58,210
Mike!

1563
01:30:59,321 --> 01:31:01,347
Michael!

1564
01:31:09,898 --> 01:31:11,127
Shi-it!

1565
01:31:16,638 --> 01:31:19,073
You will fly us out of here now!

1566
01:31:21,843 --> 01:31:24,574
Go, go! Okay, go, go!

1567
01:31:50,138 --> 01:31:51,766
Cover me!

1568
01:32:23,138 --> 01:32:24,663
Mike!

1569
01:32:52,667 --> 01:32:54,260
Close the rear door!

1570
01:32:58,640 --> 01:33:01,041
Mike!

1571
01:33:02,644 --> 01:33:04,408
Shit!

1572
01:33:05,880 --> 01:33:07,473
Hey!

1573
01:33:21,196 --> 01:33:22,824
Drop the gun!

1574
01:33:27,836 --> 01:33:30,101
A clip! Where's a clip?

1575
01:33:31,172 --> 01:33:33,038
Shit.

1576
01:33:34,576 --> 01:33:36,204
Oh, damn!

1577
01:34:02,937 --> 01:34:04,701
Sabrina!

1578
01:34:06,074 --> 01:34:08,043
There you go! Here we go!

1579
01:34:09,444 --> 01:34:11,970
Come on! All right.

1580
01:34:24,259 --> 01:34:26,194
I'm out of ammo.

1581
01:34:26,261 --> 01:34:28,462
Where's Benin?- I nailed him.

1582
01:34:28,463 --> 01:34:30,464
Yeah?

1583
01:34:30,465 --> 01:34:32,499
Now we're even on the box car.

1584
01:34:32,500 --> 01:34:34,025
Yeah, yeah.

1585
01:34:40,508 --> 01:34:42,101
Oh, shit.

1586
01:34:43,344 --> 01:34:45,813
No. No way!

1587
01:34:56,491 --> 01:34:58,255
Black...

1588
01:35:00,762 --> 01:35:01,696
Oh God. Think it's got

1589
01:35:01,697 --> 01:35:03,530
the same diffusing sequence?

1590
01:35:03,531 --> 01:35:05,899
I don't know, I gotta believe so.

1591
01:35:05,900 --> 01:35:08,870
Black, blue...

1592
01:35:08,937 --> 01:35:11,805
green... Oh God, Michael.

1593
01:35:19,113 --> 01:35:21,281
Whoever is hearing this,

1594
01:35:21,282 --> 01:35:23,877
I give you the rest of your life.

1595
01:35:26,588 --> 01:35:28,523
Yeah, I knew it all along.

1596
01:35:30,225 --> 01:35:31,955
You too, huh?

1597
01:35:32,026 --> 01:35:34,393
Oh. Oh, yeah.

1598
01:35:37,498 --> 01:35:39,296
Oh yeah.

1599
01:36:00,121 --> 01:36:03,549
Michael? Michael, come in, will you?

1600
01:36:04,826 --> 01:36:06,593
Damn it, what is going on?

1601
01:36:06,594 --> 01:36:09,529
Ms. Carver... somebody... answer.

1602
01:36:09,530 --> 01:36:11,726
Michael!

1603
01:36:19,641 --> 01:36:21,542
What a night.

1604
01:36:23,511 --> 01:36:25,742
What a day.

1605
01:36:28,683 --> 01:36:30,811
I wonder who won Daytona.
