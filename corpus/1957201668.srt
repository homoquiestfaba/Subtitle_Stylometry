Hey, Monroe, check out

00:13:30,292 --> 00:13:32,259
- Uh, that's the house
right up there, Ronnie.

210
00:13:32,294 --> 00:13:35,745
Walk up the path and uh,
find a camp with down spouts.

[laughing]

212
00:13:39,853 --> 00:13:41,821

Okay, seriously,
you're gonna kill me.

214

don't throw it!

219

Got it.

Bye Ronnie!

223

224
00:14:02,945 --> 00:14:04,326
Hope you crash into an iceberg.

225
00:14:04,360 --> 00:14:07,432

Nicole, you wanna try?

233
00:16:03,272 --> 00:16:05,067
- You know I don't
do anything sporty.

234
00:16:05,102 --> 00:16:07,414
- Come on, it's easy,
we'll show you how.

235

- Come on Nicole,
I'll set you up.

236

parents are dead.

Oh, if it's too personal, I'll
promise not to tell anyone.

238
00:16:26,019 --> 00:16:28,711
- Look, they died when Monroe
and I were little kids.

239
00:16:28,746 --> 00:16:30,644
No one really knows how.

240
00:16:30,679 --> 00:16:33,268
I mean if they did,
they never told us, so.

241
00:16:33,302 --> 00:16:35,132
My grandparents never
talked about it,

242
00:16:35,166 --> 00:16:39,895
and my grandma just died,
so, yeah I don't know.

243
00:16:39,929 --> 00:16:41,621
- Wow.

244
00:16:41,655 --> 00:16:44,624
That totally sucks.

245
00:16:44,658 --> 00:16:49,663
- Yeah, it really, really sucks.

246
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,461
- [Lamont] Once I
find me a gas station,

247
00:16:54,496 --> 00:16:56,153
I'ma find me some new friends.

248
00:16:56,187 --> 00:16:58,293
And some new white bitches.

249
00:16:58,327 --> 00:16:59,880
Quarter mile, my ass.

250
00:16:59,915 --> 00:17:01,572
This is some bullshit!

251
00:17:01,606 --> 00:17:04,195
I'm gonna take my black
ass right back to New York.

252
00:17:04,230 --> 00:17:08,372
I'm the only black dude
in the state of Maine.

253
00:17:08,406 --> 00:17:11,099
I don't even see
any black bears.

254
00:17:11,133 --> 00:17:13,515
The roads aren't
even black up here!

255
00:17:13,549 --> 00:17:16,587
Where the fuck is
this gas station?!

256
00:17:16,621 --> 00:17:18,761
Shit.

257
00:17:18,796 --> 00:17:20,315
Whoa, was that a
mother fucking zebra?

Uh-uh, they eat people!

259
00:17:22,213 --> 00:17:24,284
I've seen enough horror movies.

260
00:17:24,319 --> 00:17:27,529
I'm getting up outta here.

261
00:17:27,563 --> 00:17:28,806
- Don't you think we should
be getting back to the house

262
00:17:28,840 --> 00:17:30,221
to pick up Lamont?

263
00:17:30,256 --> 00:17:32,361
- He's got Ronnie to keep
him company, he'll be fine.

264
00:17:32,396 --> 00:17:34,432
- You just want to be
alone with three hot girls.

265
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:38,264
- Okay, first of all,
one of them is my sister.

266
00:17:38,298 --> 00:17:43,303
And second of all, I
only need one hot girl.

267
00:17:44,373 --> 00:17:45,547
- Do you guys have a
different color board,

268
00:17:45,581 --> 00:17:48,515
because this one clashes
with my bathing suit.

269
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:50,793
- And I"m gonna give you
one guess who it's not.

270
00:17:50,828 --> 00:17:54,970
- Oooh, a loon!

271
00:17:56,903 --> 00:18:01,908
- Look, I know I've
been off, and I know

272
00:18:04,669 --> 00:18:07,776
with a little bit of time...

273
00:18:07,810 --> 00:18:12,712
No, hey, not apart, together.

274
00:18:12,746 --> 00:18:14,369
With a little bit of
time together, I know

275
00:18:14,403 --> 00:18:16,647
that I'm gonna get
readjusted again and,

276
00:18:16,681 --> 00:18:18,890
I really think that--

277
00:18:18,925 --> 00:18:20,444
- She's ready.

278
00:18:20,478 --> 00:18:24,275

We got company.

How you doing this
glorious afternoon?

until I saw you kids

We're just having a
little fun, that's all.

fun, I consider dangerous.

We're 80 miles from

I advise you to slow down,
and lower your voices.

we shouldn't show excitement

me to give you a ticket?

- No, no sir, absolutely
not, we'll be more careful.

318

You kids have a good day.

320

just lie there reading
your damn book?

You know, in a town with
indoor plumbing and cable TV.

This place is awesome.

hiking and swimming and fishing.

348
00:24:33,402 --> 00:24:35,784
You guys all need to lighten
up and go have some fun.

- Come on Ronnie, it'll be fun.

353
00:24:44,655 --> 00:24:46,795
- Yeah, we can learn all about
your amazing life exploits.

354
00:24:46,830 --> 00:24:48,935
- Yeah, that you
read about in books.

355
00:24:48,970 --> 00:24:50,489
- At least I can read.

356
00:24:50,523 --> 00:24:52,387
- Burn!

357
00:24:52,421 --> 00:24:54,354
- I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

358
00:24:54,389 --> 00:24:55,424
You're hot.

359
00:24:55,459 --> 00:24:58,842
- I know.

360
00:24:59,670 --> 00:25:03,260
- Okay remember if you've
done it, you have to drink.

361
00:25:03,294 --> 00:25:06,470
Never have I ever made out
with someone of the same sex.

362
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,784
Drink.

363
00:25:09,818 --> 00:25:11,855
- Really?

364
00:25:11,889 --> 00:25:13,581
- No, I don't need to know
this stuff about my sister.

365
00:25:13,615 --> 00:25:14,858
- That's what the parents
get for sending me

366
00:25:14,892 --> 00:25:16,445
to all-girl summer camp.

367
00:25:16,480 --> 00:25:19,414
- You did this at Catholic camp?

368
00:25:20,208 --> 00:25:22,624
Please don't tell me
it was one of the nuns.

369
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:27,215
- Wait, am I the only one
who hasn't kissed a girl?

370
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,229
Ow!

371
00:25:42,264 --> 00:25:43,818
- Okay, my turn.

372
00:25:43,852 --> 00:25:46,924
Never have I ever had more than

373
00:25:46,959 --> 00:25:49,306
two sexual partners in my life.

374
00:25:49,340 --> 00:25:50,963
- That's so stupid, now
everybody's gonna drink.

375
00:25:50,997 --> 00:25:52,240
- Cheers.

376
00:25:52,274 --> 00:25:55,623
[laughing]

377
00:25:55,657 --> 00:25:56,796
Dude, come on!

378
00:25:56,831 --> 00:25:57,590
- No, I didn't even
hear the question.

379
00:25:57,625 --> 00:25:58,833
- Of course you didn't.

380
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,248
- You know what, this
game's stupid okay,

381
00:26:00,282 --> 00:26:02,181
I'm gonna take a leak.

382
00:26:02,215 --> 00:26:05,184
- Come on, Ronnie.

383
00:26:05,218 --> 00:26:07,531
- I bet he's gonna go whack
off to the two of you kissing.

384
00:26:07,566 --> 00:26:09,153
- Gross.- Eww.

385
00:26:09,188 --> 00:26:11,431
- Alright, whatever
it's my turn.

386
00:26:11,466 --> 00:26:13,641
Never have I ever--

387
00:26:13,675 --> 00:26:15,712
- Hey Lamont's been gone
for three hours already.

388
00:26:15,746 --> 00:26:17,334
- Maybe he's getting lucky.

389
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,646
- Yeah, for three hours?

390
00:26:18,680 --> 00:26:20,579
- Just because you could
never last that long

391
00:26:20,613 --> 00:26:21,959
doesn't mean that
someone else couldn't.

392
00:26:21,994 --> 00:26:23,409
- Oh, ha ha.

393
00:26:23,443 --> 00:26:24,617
- Monroe.

394
00:26:24,652 --> 00:26:26,101
- Yeah, alright tell
you what, why don't we

395
00:26:26,136 --> 00:26:27,206
all go to the marina, we'll see

396
00:26:27,240 --> 00:26:29,346
if Captain Friendly
has seen him.

397
00:26:29,380 --> 00:26:30,485
Is that cool?

398
00:26:30,519 --> 00:26:31,348
- Okay.

399
00:26:31,382 --> 00:26:32,521
- Alright, let's go.

400
00:26:32,556 --> 00:26:36,318
- Fine, but nobody
better puke on me again.

401
00:26:36,353 --> 00:26:39,390
- Wait.

402
00:26:39,425 --> 00:26:43,325
Did you hear that?

403
00:26:45,949 --> 00:26:48,572
- What's wrong?

404
00:26:48,607 --> 00:26:52,334
- I hear something.

405
00:26:52,369 --> 00:26:55,406
- Gross!

406
00:26:55,441 --> 00:26:58,513
- He is so disgusting!

407
00:26:58,547 --> 00:27:02,448
- Hey Ronnie, we're
gonna go to the marina

408
00:27:02,482 --> 00:27:05,520
to check on Lamont,
we'll be back in a few.

409
00:27:05,554 --> 00:27:09,662
We'll leave you to
do your business.

410
00:27:11,250 --> 00:27:14,460
- [Ronnie] They're all
gonna laugh at you.

411
00:27:14,494 --> 00:27:17,912
Wait, wait.

412
00:27:17,946 --> 00:27:22,157
Guys, it's not what you, think.

413
00:27:22,192 --> 00:27:27,197
[ominous music]

414
00:28:37,923 --> 00:28:42,928
An autographed copy of
King's first pop-up book.

415
00:28:45,309 --> 00:28:49,555
I can't believe they
just left you here.

416
00:28:51,971 --> 00:28:55,941
Oh my...

417
00:28:56,182 --> 00:29:01,187
I will show you the
respect you deserve.

418
00:29:04,604 --> 00:29:06,779
- [Nicole] Who
invited that weirdo?

419
00:29:06,814 --> 00:29:08,194
- [Monroe] I know
he can be annoying,

420
00:29:08,229 --> 00:29:10,541
but you get used to him.

421
00:29:10,576 --> 00:29:12,440
We grew up next to one
another and you know,

422
00:29:12,474 --> 00:29:14,614
his parents looked after us.

423
00:29:14,649 --> 00:29:15,926
- [Nicole] Well if he
tries to rub up against me

424
00:29:15,961 --> 00:29:18,239
accidentally one more
time, I'm going to

425
00:29:18,273 --> 00:29:19,896
drown him in the lake.

426
00:29:19,930 --> 00:29:21,898
[loon cries]

427
00:29:21,932 --> 00:29:24,176
- [Lori] Uhhhh, what's that?

428
00:29:24,210 --> 00:29:28,249
- [Monroe] Ha ha,
now that's a loon.

429
00:29:36,498 --> 00:29:39,432
- [Nicole] Oh my god,
creep guy is still there.

430
00:29:39,467 --> 00:29:43,402
What a loser!

431
00:29:44,127 --> 00:29:45,749
- Guess you girls all
want me to go talk to him?

432
00:29:45,784 --> 00:29:46,992
- I'm not doing it.

433
00:29:47,026 --> 00:29:48,096
- I'll do it, I'm good
at getting loser guys

434
00:29:48,131 --> 00:29:51,859
to do anything I want.

435
00:29:55,207 --> 00:29:56,518
- You done on the lake?

436
00:29:56,553 --> 00:29:59,349
- No silly, we were
looking for our friend?

437
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,661
He's about this tall,
and he's wearing--

438
00:30:01,696 --> 00:30:04,354
- Negro?

439
00:30:04,388 --> 00:30:07,391
- Yeah, that's him,
have you seen him?

440
00:30:07,426 --> 00:30:10,153
- Saw him with you
when you came in here.

441
00:30:10,187 --> 00:30:12,362
- I mean since that time?

442
00:30:12,396 --> 00:30:14,536
- Nope.

443
00:30:14,571 --> 00:30:16,366
- He took the van with him.

444
00:30:16,400 --> 00:30:19,265
Did you see which way he went?

445
00:30:19,300 --> 00:30:24,305
- Went north, to
the gas station.

446
00:30:25,962 --> 00:30:29,758
That way, quarter mile.

447
00:30:29,793 --> 00:30:34,798
- It's so dark out, any
chance we could get a lift?

448
00:30:35,143 --> 00:30:40,148
- Not much traffic around
here, but someone like you?

449
00:30:41,184 --> 00:30:44,532
You could get lucky.

450
00:30:44,566 --> 00:30:45,567
- Forget it.

451
00:30:45,602 --> 00:30:49,123
Thanks anyway.

452
00:30:52,333 --> 00:30:53,541
- Well?

453
00:30:53,575 --> 00:30:56,095
- I think he likes little boys.

454
00:30:56,130 --> 00:30:57,786
- I meant Lamont.

455
00:30:57,821 --> 00:31:01,342
- I don't know if Lamont
likes little boys.

456
00:31:01,376 --> 00:31:03,240
- Did he say where Lamont went?

457
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:05,415
- Oh, hasn't seen him
and won't give us a ride

458
00:31:05,449 --> 00:31:06,899
to go look for him.

459
00:31:06,934 --> 00:31:08,418
So the gas station's
a quarter mile north,

460
00:31:08,452 --> 00:31:09,419
which means that way.

461
00:31:09,453 --> 00:31:10,489
- I know, I know.

462
00:31:10,523 --> 00:31:11,524
Let's go?

463
00:31:11,559 --> 00:31:13,354
- What are we gonna do?

464
00:31:13,388 --> 00:31:15,425
- Uh, walk?

465
00:31:15,459 --> 00:31:17,254
- I don't feel like walking.

466
00:31:17,289 --> 00:31:19,256
- You can stay here and
wait with Lurch if you want,

467
00:31:19,291 --> 00:31:21,672
but we're walking.

468
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,709
- [Nicole] I could
use the exercise.

469
00:31:23,743 --> 00:31:25,504
Don't want to end
up with a saggy ass.

470
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:28,852
No offense, sweetie.

471
00:31:30,854 --> 00:31:34,547
[ominous music]

472
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:39,863
- [Monroe] Knowing Lamont,
he's probably in Canada by now.

473
00:31:39,898 --> 00:31:41,830
- [Hilary] Why'd you
even let him drive?

474
00:31:43,971 --> 00:31:46,939
- Look out!

475
00:31:46,974 --> 00:31:50,839
Asshole, you don't even
have your sirens on?!

476
00:31:50,874 --> 00:31:51,910
You okay?

477
00:31:51,944 --> 00:31:55,775
- Thanks.

478
00:31:58,537 --> 00:31:59,952
- You kids shouldn't
be around here.

479
00:31:59,987 --> 00:32:01,471
- Sir, I think that's our car.

480
00:32:01,505 --> 00:32:02,610
- What's your name, son?

481
00:32:02,644 --> 00:32:04,370
- Monroe Bachman.

482
00:32:04,405 --> 00:32:05,958
- You staying at the
old Bachman house?

483
00:32:05,993 --> 00:32:09,824
- Yeah, it was
our grandparents'.

484
00:32:09,858 --> 00:32:11,722
- We're worried about our
friend Lamont Jackson,

485
00:32:11,757 --> 00:32:13,207
I mean is he alright?

486
00:32:13,241 --> 00:32:14,933
- The negro fella?

487
00:32:14,967 --> 00:32:16,831
- Yeah, if it was 1950.

488
00:32:16,865 --> 00:32:18,937
- Well I'm afraid the
news ain't good, miss.

489
00:32:18,971 --> 00:32:20,110
- What do you mean?

490
00:32:20,145 --> 00:32:21,732
- Does he have any
family in the area?

491
00:32:21,767 --> 00:32:22,941
- No, no what happened?

492
00:32:22,975 --> 00:32:24,321
- Anyone that we can call?

493
00:32:24,356 --> 00:32:26,772
No, please sir, can you
just tell us what happened?

494
00:32:26,806 --> 00:32:29,499
- Well it seems that he
was attacked by an animal.

495
00:32:29,533 --> 00:32:33,675
We need someone to
identify the remains.

496
00:32:33,710 --> 00:32:37,265
- He's dead?

497
00:32:40,027 --> 00:32:42,236
I'll do it.

498
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,133
- I'll go with you.

499
00:32:43,168 --> 00:32:45,273
- No.

500
00:32:45,308 --> 00:32:49,519
You don't want to see that.

501
00:32:49,553 --> 00:32:53,833
[machine guns and explosions,
indistinct yelling]

502
00:33:05,500 --> 00:33:09,194
- Normally, we have
you identify the face.

503
00:33:10,022 --> 00:33:13,646
We haven't found it yet.

504
00:33:19,031 --> 00:33:21,723
You okay?

505
00:33:21,758 --> 00:33:25,900
- Can we just do
this quick, please?

506
00:33:41,226 --> 00:33:44,746
- Dodd, which one has the arm?

507
00:33:51,650 --> 00:33:54,308
Damn it Dodd, those
are the intestines!

508
00:33:54,342 --> 00:33:58,174
- Sorry Sheriff, check
the one to the right.

509
00:34:04,594 --> 00:34:07,528
- I think that's him,
that's his tattoo.

510
00:34:07,562 --> 00:34:09,426
- Alright, then.

511
00:34:09,461 --> 00:34:10,979
- What kind of animal
attacks a man at a gas staion

512
00:34:11,014 --> 00:34:13,223
in the middle of the day?

513
00:34:13,258 --> 00:34:15,570
- Well we have wolves in
this part of the state.

514
00:34:15,605 --> 00:34:16,778
- A wolf attacked him?

515
00:34:16,813 --> 00:34:20,610
- Yeah, something wolf-like.

516
00:34:22,646 --> 00:34:24,303
- He see what did this?

517
00:34:24,338 --> 00:34:25,787
- No.

518
00:34:25,822 --> 00:34:27,168
- His office is right there,
and he didn't see anything?

519
00:34:27,203 --> 00:34:30,206
- Your friend went
inside, paid for his gas,

520
00:34:30,240 --> 00:34:32,449
and he came out and
went back to the car.

521
00:34:32,484 --> 00:34:33,899
- And between the
building and the minivan,

522
00:34:33,933 --> 00:34:37,385
my friend was torn apart
by a wolf, and that guy

523
00:34:37,420 --> 00:34:38,938
didn't hear or see anything?

524
00:34:38,973 --> 00:34:40,423
- He was out back.

525
00:34:40,457 --> 00:34:41,769
He didn't hear a thing.

526
00:34:41,803 --> 00:34:45,013
- I thought you said
Lamont paid inside.

527
00:34:46,187 --> 00:34:48,500
- Wait, son.

528
00:34:48,534 --> 00:34:49,639
- [Dodd] Sheriff?

529
00:34:49,673 --> 00:34:52,711
- Just let him
ask his questions.

530
00:34:52,918 --> 00:34:55,541
- You didn't hear anything?

531
00:34:55,576 --> 00:34:57,440
- Nope.

532
00:34:57,474 --> 00:35:00,201
- How is that possible?

533
00:35:00,236 --> 00:35:01,651
If you're getting ripped
apart by an animal

534
00:35:01,685 --> 00:35:03,515
you'd be screaming pretty
fucking loud, wouldn't you?

535
00:35:03,549 --> 00:35:05,862
- Lower your voice, boy.

536
00:35:05,896 --> 00:35:08,520
And watch your language.

537
00:35:08,554 --> 00:35:11,212
- I was out back,
couldn't hear anything

538
00:35:11,247 --> 00:35:15,596
but that loud rap music.

539
00:35:15,630 --> 00:35:18,219
Even if I was out front,
I probably couldn't

540
00:35:18,254 --> 00:35:22,258
have heard anything.

541
00:35:27,987 --> 00:35:32,716
- Nice quiet little town
you got here, sheriff.

542
00:35:45,729 --> 00:35:49,423
- What are we gonna do?

543
00:35:51,252 --> 00:35:54,497
- I don't know.

544
00:35:55,463 --> 00:35:58,639
I don't know what
the hell's going on.

546
00:36:05,335 --> 00:36:06,267

547
00:36:06,302 --> 00:36:07,303
- Not now Ronnie.

548
00:36:07,337 --> 00:36:08,235
- What happened?

549
00:36:08,269 --> 00:36:09,236
Where's Lamont?

550
00:36:09,270 --> 00:36:11,514
- Where's Lamont, Lamont's dead!

551
00:36:11,548 --> 00:36:13,136
- Ha, must be my birthday.

552
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:16,898
- It's not a joke
Ronnie, he's dead.

553
00:36:18,383 --> 00:36:22,214
- Wait, you mean metaphorically?

554
00:36:22,766 --> 00:36:27,771
[Nicole crying, sad piano music]

555
00:36:48,861 --> 00:36:51,416
You alright?

556
00:36:51,450 --> 00:36:54,350
It's okay.

557
00:36:54,384 --> 00:36:59,147
- I just can't
believe he's dead.

558
00:37:03,531 --> 00:37:06,638
What the fuck, get away
from me you fucking sicko!

559
00:37:06,672 --> 00:37:07,570
- What?

560
00:37:07,604 --> 00:37:09,157
- This jerkoff tried to kiss me!

561
00:37:09,192 --> 00:37:10,504
- What the fuck, Ronnie?

562
00:37:10,538 --> 00:37:12,644
- Hey, we all grieve in
different ways, right?

563
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:14,301
- And you grieve by making out?

564
00:37:14,335 --> 00:37:15,543
- I thought there
was a connection.

565
00:37:15,578 --> 00:37:17,269
- The only connection
is bringing my foot

566
00:37:17,304 --> 00:37:19,823
to your balls, you creep!

567
00:37:19,858 --> 00:37:22,688
I'm not staying in the same
house as this asshole anymore!

568
00:37:22,723 --> 00:37:25,588
- Way to go, asshole.

569
00:37:25,622 --> 00:37:27,175
- Why am I the asshole, alright?

570
00:37:27,210 --> 00:37:30,869
It's not like I'm the
one who killed Lamont.

571
00:37:32,664 --> 00:37:35,494
- Can you just, can you just
go somewhere and chill, please?

572
00:37:35,529 --> 00:37:37,565
- Where, into the forest
with the man-eating wolf?

573
00:37:37,600 --> 00:37:38,808
- Hey if it's a man-eating
wolf, you should have

574
00:37:38,842 --> 00:37:42,121
nothing to worry about.

575
00:37:42,156 --> 00:37:46,022
- Fine, I'll just
go sit and read.

576
00:37:50,440 --> 00:37:54,927
- He's gonna read a
Stephen King book to chill?

577
00:38:02,452 --> 00:38:05,938
- I'm so sorry about that.

578
00:38:07,181 --> 00:38:09,217
Ah man, I never thought
that he'd try to

579
00:38:09,252 --> 00:38:12,393
make a move on you now,
Ronnie surprises even me

580
00:38:12,428 --> 00:38:14,913
sometimes, I guess.

581
00:38:14,947 --> 00:38:19,642
- Is this all supposed to be
part of him growing on me?

582
00:38:28,271 --> 00:38:29,790
- What?

583
00:38:32,931 --> 00:38:35,520
What?

584
00:38:36,866 --> 00:38:37,591
Fine.

585
00:38:37,625 --> 00:38:39,351
I'll go apologize.

586
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:42,975
You know, it is possible
for someone to love me.

587
00:38:43,010 --> 00:38:47,601
- You know just, just
seeing Lamont there,

588
00:38:47,635 --> 00:38:50,362
like knowing I
couldn't do anything...

589
00:38:50,397 --> 00:38:53,434
- Monroe, I love you.

590
00:38:55,367 --> 00:38:58,336
- What was that?

591
00:39:00,993 --> 00:39:03,824
Oh great, a really good idea.

00:39:06,999 --> 00:39:08,346
Ronnie!

595
00:39:08,380 --> 00:39:09,588
- You are a
backstabbing hypocrite.

596
00:39:09,623 --> 00:39:10,520
- No wait, wait.

597
00:39:10,555 --> 00:39:11,797
- What happened now?

598
00:39:11,832 --> 00:39:12,971
- What happened is I go
back there to apologize,

599
00:39:13,005 --> 00:39:13,903
and this guy--

600
00:39:13,937 --> 00:39:15,042
- No, it's not what you think--

601
00:39:15,076 --> 00:39:15,939
- This guy's making
out with Nicole.

602
00:39:15,974 --> 00:39:17,838
- Oh, I was not!

603
00:39:17,872 --> 00:39:19,115
- What happened?

604
00:39:19,149 --> 00:39:20,323
- What happened is your
boyfriend was making out

605
00:39:20,358 --> 00:39:21,635
with the girl that
I was gonna marry.

606
00:39:21,669 --> 00:39:22,946
- Oh gimme a break.

607
00:39:22,981 --> 00:39:24,189
- You were making
out with Nicole?

608
00:39:24,223 --> 00:39:25,915
- He thought that she
was gonna marry him?

609
00:39:25,949 --> 00:39:28,193
- No, yes, not really.

610
00:39:28,227 --> 00:39:30,782

gotta let me explain.

611
00:39:30,816 --> 00:39:31,507
- Don't!

613
00:39:40,550 --> 00:39:42,207
Lori, wait, hey!

614
00:39:42,241 --> 00:39:44,485
- Get your hands off
of me, you asshole.

615
00:39:44,520 --> 00:39:46,211
- [Ronnie] At least I'm
not the asshole anymore!

616
00:39:46,245 --> 00:39:48,316
- Just stay out of this, Ronnie!

617
00:39:48,351 --> 00:39:49,697
Come on, please
just let me explain.

618
00:39:49,732 --> 00:39:52,528
- You left me to go to Iraq
for a year, and I wait.

619

Then you come back, you tell
me you need some time alone.

620
00:39:54,978 --> 00:39:56,394
And I wait.

621
00:39:56,428 --> 00:39:58,257
Then, you tell me you
wanna stay friends,

622
00:39:58,292 --> 00:40:00,398
and I wait some more?

623
00:40:00,432 --> 00:40:05,403
Finally, you invite me
up here, and now this?

624
00:40:06,369 --> 00:40:08,785
I was fucking waiting for this.

625
00:40:08,820 --> 00:40:10,442
- Hey, hey.

626
00:40:10,477 --> 00:40:12,548
She kissed me.

627
00:40:12,582 --> 00:40:14,377
- So you did kiss her.

628
00:40:14,412 --> 00:40:16,759
- No, no, no, you're not
even listening to me.

629
00:40:16,793 --> 00:40:18,554
- Listen to you?

630
00:40:18,588 --> 00:40:23,006
I don't ever want
to see you again.

631
00:40:23,628 --> 00:40:24,974
You know what?

632
00:40:25,008 --> 00:40:29,875

you for being crazy.

- Where's Lori?

637
00:40:50,827 --> 00:40:52,691
- She ran off into the woods.

638
00:40:52,726 --> 00:40:54,244
- Wait, you left her alone?

639
00:40:54,279 --> 00:40:56,488
- She didn't want
me to be near her.

640

If it hadn't been for
Nicole kissing me I--

641

- If you hadn't invited that
perverted friend of yours--

00:46:34,895 --> 00:46:36,034
was following me.

708
00:46:36,069 --> 00:46:37,035
- Yeah, I was following
you, didn't think

709
00:46:37,070 --> 00:46:38,485
you'd try to kill me for it.

710
00:46:38,519 --> 00:46:39,935
- Something happened to Lori.

711
00:46:39,969 --> 00:46:40,832
- What happened?

712
00:46:40,867 --> 00:46:42,869
- Her skull was crushed in.

713
00:46:42,903 --> 00:46:46,010
- How bad of an argument
did you guys have?

714
00:46:46,044 --> 00:46:47,666
- It wasn't me, you idiot.

715
00:46:47,701 --> 00:46:49,599
- Oh, an accident.

716
00:46:49,634 --> 00:46:51,187
Don't worry, I'll
corroborate the story,

717
00:46:51,222 --> 00:46:54,225
but you let me keep Nicole.

718
00:46:54,259 --> 00:46:56,779
- There's something so wrong
with you, you know that?

719
00:46:56,814 --> 00:46:58,988
- Yeah.

720
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:01,991
- Look, don't tell the girls
this, but I don't think

721
00:47:02,026 --> 00:47:05,339
it was an animal, I
think she was murdered.

722
00:47:05,374 --> 00:47:08,480
Something bashed
her, her skull in.

723
00:47:08,515 --> 00:47:10,620
- Fuck me.

724
00:47:10,655 --> 00:47:13,106
- Look I need your help,
come with me, I ...

725
00:47:13,140 --> 00:47:16,764
I need you to help
bury the body.

726
00:47:16,799 --> 00:47:19,284
- Cool.

727
00:47:19,319 --> 00:47:23,910
[ominous music]

728
00:47:28,949 --> 00:47:30,537
- Where the hell have you been?

729
00:47:30,571 --> 00:47:33,436
- I was burying
Lori, you know that.

730
00:47:33,471 --> 00:47:35,714
- Not you, him.

731
00:47:35,749 --> 00:47:37,199
- I was with Monroe.

732
00:47:37,233 --> 00:47:38,925
- How did you know
where Monroe was?

733
00:47:38,959 --> 00:47:40,858
- I saw him leaving the barn?

734
00:47:40,892 --> 00:47:42,273
- The girls didn't
tell you where I was?

735
00:47:42,307 --> 00:47:43,722
- So?

736
00:47:43,757 --> 00:47:44,827
- When we came back from the
woods after finding Lori,

737
00:47:44,862 --> 00:47:45,897
where were you?

738
00:47:45,932 --> 00:47:47,036
- I was here?

739
00:47:47,071 --> 00:47:48,417
- I called for you,
you didn't answer.

740
00:47:48,451 --> 00:47:49,625
- I was out back.

741
00:47:49,659 --> 00:47:51,592
- Ronnie, what were
you doing out there?

742
00:47:51,627 --> 00:47:52,766
- Clearing my head?

743
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:54,423
- Well you didn't
hear Lori screaming?

744
00:47:54,457 --> 00:47:55,873
- Of course I heard her
scream, half of Maine

745
00:47:55,907 --> 00:48:00,360
heard her scream, I just figured
she was yelling at Monroe.

746
00:48:00,843 --> 00:48:02,362
- What's out there?

747
00:48:02,396 --> 00:48:03,915
Is it really a wolf?

748
00:48:03,950 --> 00:48:06,297
- Monroe thinks it's a killer.

749
00:48:06,331 --> 00:48:08,437
I mean a killer wolf,
as we've clearly seen,

750
00:48:08,471 --> 00:48:10,508
with the wolfy fangs.

751
00:48:10,542 --> 00:48:12,890
- You think Lori was murdered?

752
00:48:13,891 --> 00:48:15,754
- It just didn't look
like an animal did that.

753
00:48:15,789 --> 00:48:17,618
- So you think Lamont
was murdered, too?

754
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:20,311
- I don't know I'm,
I'm still trying

755
00:48:20,345 --> 00:48:24,177
to put all the pieces together.

756
00:48:24,832 --> 00:48:26,006
- We have to call the sheriff.

757
00:48:26,041 --> 00:48:28,422
- With what phone?

758
00:48:28,457 --> 00:48:29,907
What if we go to a
neighbor's house?

759
00:48:29,941 --> 00:48:31,287
- Good idea!

760
00:48:31,322 --> 00:48:34,601
- Nicole, wait, wait!

761
00:48:34,635 --> 00:48:36,016
- Can someone help us?!

762
00:48:36,051 --> 00:48:37,811
Please!

763
00:48:37,845 --> 00:48:39,744
- Shh, shh, have you seen the
people in this town, Nicole?

764
00:48:39,778 --> 00:48:43,782
- Can anyone help us?!

765
00:48:46,440 --> 00:48:49,650
What's wrong with these people?

766
00:48:49,685 --> 00:48:54,034
- I have no idea.

767
00:48:56,968 --> 00:48:58,211
- Don't you think it's
strange that of this

768
00:48:58,245 --> 00:49:02,353
is happening where
Stephen King lives?

769
00:49:02,698 --> 00:49:04,113
- What was Lori wearing
before she left?

770
00:49:04,148 --> 00:49:05,528
- God, not now Ronnie.

771
00:49:05,563 --> 00:49:07,116
- No no, when we buried her,
she had on a sailor cap,

772
00:49:07,151 --> 00:49:08,255
did she have that on before?

773
00:49:08,290 --> 00:49:09,153
- What the fuck
does that have to do

774
00:49:09,187 --> 00:49:10,568
with anything, you pervert?

775
00:49:10,602 --> 00:49:11,949
- If you would just listen
to me, you would learn

776
00:49:11,983 --> 00:49:13,295
that in the Stephen
King short story

777
00:49:13,329 --> 00:49:15,262
The Man Who Loved Flowers,
a character wearing

778
00:49:15,297 --> 00:49:17,230
a sailor top was
killed with a hammer.

779
00:49:17,264 --> 00:49:18,645
- Lori wasn't
wearing a sailor top.

780
00:49:18,679 --> 00:49:20,026
- How do you know she
was killed with a hammer?

781
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:22,062
- Guys, this is my girlfriend
you're talking about.

782
00:49:22,097 --> 00:49:25,203
- Well technically,
ex-girlfriend.

783
00:49:26,515 --> 00:49:28,310
- Look stop, I didn't say
Lori was killed with a hammer,

784
00:49:28,344 --> 00:49:29,414
I just said that
the character was,

785
00:49:29,449 --> 00:49:31,071
and her head was
crushed like it.

786
00:49:31,106 --> 00:49:32,003
- Her head was crushed?

787
00:49:32,038 --> 00:49:33,522
- Ronnie, you're not helping.

788
00:49:33,556 --> 00:49:35,006
- Okay, well, what about Lamont?

789
00:49:35,041 --> 00:49:36,456
- What about Lamont,
what about Lamont,

790
00:49:36,490 --> 00:49:38,492
did a character get killed
by an animal in what,

791
00:49:38,527 --> 00:49:41,495
Stephen King's 210th novel?

792
00:49:41,530 --> 00:49:43,670
- Well, wolves do kill
the kid in The Stand.

793
00:49:43,704 --> 00:49:44,878
- Ronnie!

794
00:49:44,912 --> 00:49:45,810
- You're right, he
was under the control

795
00:49:45,844 --> 00:49:46,984
of the Dark Man, Randall Flagg.

796
00:49:47,018 --> 00:49:47,881
- Ronnie.

797
00:49:47,915 --> 00:49:48,744
- Look, how did Lamont die?

798
00:49:48,778 --> 00:49:50,056
- You are being morbid.

799
00:49:50,090 --> 00:49:51,402
- Just tell me how he died!

800
00:49:51,436 --> 00:49:52,575
- Fuck you, Ronnie.

801
00:49:52,610 --> 00:49:53,818
- You want to know
how Lamont died?

802
00:49:53,852 --> 00:49:55,130
He got torn limb from
limb in the minivan,

803
00:49:55,164 --> 00:49:56,890
and they found pieces of
him in the front seat,

804
00:49:56,924 --> 00:49:58,340
pieces of him in the
back seat, and whoever

805
00:49:58,374 --> 00:50:00,583
or whatever did this took
his head along with him,

806
00:50:00,618 --> 00:50:01,964
are you happy?

807
00:50:01,999 --> 00:50:03,448
- Oh my god.

808
00:50:03,483 --> 00:50:07,004
- Wait, if he was torn apart,
how do you know it was him?

809
00:50:07,659 --> 00:50:09,592
- I saw his arm, the
one with the tattoo.

810
00:50:09,627 --> 00:50:11,560
- Wait, his arm was severed?

811
00:50:11,594 --> 00:50:13,941
- Yeah it was, at the
shoulder, like a chicken wing.

812
00:50:13,976 --> 00:50:15,115
- Jesus Christ, Monroe.

813
00:50:15,150 --> 00:50:16,461
- No, he wants to know,
so I'm telling him.

814
00:50:16,496 --> 00:50:17,704
- I don't wanna know.

815
00:50:17,738 --> 00:50:18,981
- I think it should
have been ripped off.

816
00:50:19,016 --> 00:50:20,120
- That's enough!

817
00:50:20,155 --> 00:50:23,606
I'm not listening
to any more of this!

818
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:26,920
- Was his arm cut
apart, or torn off?

819
00:50:26,954 --> 00:50:28,749
Was the flesh ripped or sliced?

820
00:50:28,784 --> 00:50:29,750
Ooo, were there bite marks?

821
00:50:29,785 --> 00:50:30,648
- I'm not having
any more of this

822
00:50:30,682 --> 00:50:31,856
conversation with you, okay?

823
00:50:31,890 --> 00:50:33,789
- Then how do we know
it was an animal?

824
00:50:33,823 --> 00:50:36,033
If his arm was sliced, then
somebody, not something

825
00:50:36,067 --> 00:50:38,552
did this to him, and your
suspicions might be right.

826
00:50:38,587 --> 00:50:40,037
We could all be
in serious danger.

827
00:50:40,071 --> 00:50:41,072
- Don't you think two
of our friends dying

828
00:50:41,107 --> 00:50:43,316
qualifies us for serious danger?

829
00:50:43,350 --> 00:50:47,561
- No, not just serious danger.

830
00:50:48,148 --> 00:50:52,118
Stephen King danger.

831
00:50:52,704 --> 00:50:54,189
I think Lamont was
cut apart by a killer

832
00:50:54,223 --> 00:50:55,880
with a very sharp knife,
and his body parts

833
00:50:55,914 --> 00:50:58,607
strewn about the car, just
like in Strawberry Spring,

834
00:50:58,641 --> 00:51:00,885
from the King
collection Night Shift.

835
00:51:00,919 --> 00:51:02,645
They couldn't find
his head, either.

836
00:51:02,680 --> 00:51:04,406
- For crying out loud
Ronnie, why would anyone

837
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:07,857
try to kill us?

838
00:51:09,618 --> 00:51:11,413
- Oh my god, that's it.

839
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:13,000
- What's it?

840
00:51:13,035 --> 00:51:15,037
- Crying out loud

841
00:51:15,072 --> 00:51:17,660
That's it, crying out loud.

842
00:51:17,695 --> 00:51:20,180
Did you notice anything
odd about this town?

843
00:51:20,215 --> 00:51:22,079
- Well besides the fact that
people keep getting killed?

844
00:51:22,113 --> 00:51:23,563
- Yeah.

845
00:51:23,597 --> 00:51:27,601
Like the fact that it's
disturbingly quiet?

846
00:51:27,636 --> 00:51:30,535
[loon cries out]

847
00:51:30,570 --> 00:51:31,502
- This is ridiculous.

848
00:51:31,536 --> 00:51:33,400
- Is it?

849
00:51:33,435 --> 00:51:35,575
Think about it.

850
00:51:35,609 --> 00:51:38,578
Everyone in this town
is always whispering.

851
00:51:38,612 --> 00:51:42,961
The warden telling
us not to have fun?

852
00:51:42,996 --> 00:51:45,619
The ambulance drove by
with no sirens blaring.

853
00:51:45,654 --> 00:51:47,138
- I bet you Lamont was
playing his radio all loud

854
00:51:47,173 --> 00:51:48,760
and he got capped 'cuz of it.

855
00:51:48,795 --> 00:51:50,245
- And Lori was so mad at me.

856
00:51:50,279 --> 00:51:51,487
- Mad?

857
00:51:51,522 --> 00:51:52,764
She was yelling all over
the place, calling you

858
00:51:52,799 --> 00:51:54,525
an asshole, screaming
at the top of her lungs.

859
00:51:54,559 --> 00:51:57,769
Which I'm guessing didn't
make the killer very happy.

860
00:51:57,804 --> 00:52:01,635
- Why would anyone kill
just to shut people up?

861
00:52:08,539 --> 00:52:11,611
You need to stop
hanging out with him.

862
00:52:11,645 --> 00:52:12,922
Hey, Nicole?

863
00:52:12,957 --> 00:52:14,993
- [whispering] Hey Hil, Hilary.

864
00:52:15,028 --> 00:52:17,651
Just keep your voice down.

865
00:52:17,686 --> 00:52:21,310
Just in case.

866
00:52:33,011 --> 00:52:36,877
- Hilary, please tell me
you know what's going on.

867
00:52:36,912 --> 00:52:39,501
- I wish I did, but I don't.

868
00:52:39,535 --> 00:52:42,055
- Do you think
we're safe in here?

869
00:52:42,089 --> 00:52:46,404
- I don't know if
we're safe anywhere.

870
00:52:46,439 --> 00:52:48,889
- But we're still safer
inside than out, right?

871
00:52:48,924 --> 00:52:51,858
- I think so.

872
00:52:54,757 --> 00:52:57,933
Why don't you take a shower?

873
00:52:57,967 --> 00:53:00,453
I'll watch the door.

874
00:53:00,487 --> 00:53:05,423
[slow, mellow music]

875
00:53:45,325 --> 00:53:50,330
[creepy music]

876
00:53:51,366 --> 00:53:55,232
- [Disembodied voice] Hush...

877
00:54:08,797 --> 00:54:10,764
[Nicole screams]

878
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:13,422
- Whoa, whoa, what
happened, what's going on?

879
00:54:13,457 --> 00:54:14,734
- Is everyone alright?

880
00:54:14,768 --> 00:54:16,287
- I saw something outside.

881
00:54:16,322 --> 00:54:20,049
I can't be here anymore,
I'm not safe here anymore.

882
00:54:20,084 --> 00:54:21,706
- It'll be okay.

883
00:54:21,741 --> 00:54:23,674
Monroe will protect us.

884
00:54:23,708 --> 00:54:25,607
He's a war veteran.

885
00:54:25,641 --> 00:54:30,439
[ominous music]

886
00:54:52,289 --> 00:54:55,671
- [Disembodied voice] Shhh...

887
00:55:16,658 --> 00:55:19,281
- Oh, Jesus, what the fuck?

888
00:55:19,316 --> 00:55:21,697
- Ronnie?

889
00:55:21,732 --> 00:55:23,423
It's okay.

890
00:55:23,458 --> 00:55:26,357
Just Ronnie.

891
00:55:26,392 --> 00:55:28,911
- What the hell are
you doing out here?

892
00:55:28,946 --> 00:55:31,914
- I was taking a leak.

893
00:55:31,949 --> 00:55:34,745
- You were watching me
shower, weren't you?

894
00:55:34,779 --> 00:55:36,678
- No, I was taking a leak.

895
00:55:36,712 --> 00:55:37,748
- You come near
me again, and I'll

896
00:55:37,782 --> 00:55:41,303
claw your fucking eyes out.

897
00:55:42,373 --> 00:55:46,135
- You're disgusting.

898
00:55:46,619 --> 00:55:50,243
- I was taking a leak.

899
00:56:02,807 --> 00:56:06,086
- Well, it's better to
have a pervert out there

900
00:56:06,121 --> 00:56:08,192
instead of a killer, right?

901
00:56:08,226 --> 00:56:10,367
[loon cries]

902
00:56:10,401 --> 00:56:12,403
- I still don't want to
be trapped in this house.

903
00:56:12,438 --> 00:56:16,407
I feel like we're sitting ducks.

904
00:56:17,891 --> 00:56:20,825
I wonder if we can make
it to the boat easily.

905
00:56:20,860 --> 00:56:24,553
[Nicole screams]

906
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,628
- Shh, shh, shh, what's
the matter, why does

907
00:56:30,663 --> 00:56:32,112
everyone keep screaming?

908
00:56:32,147 --> 00:56:33,562
- Lamont's head is
in a window sill.

909
00:56:33,597 --> 00:56:34,356
- What?

910
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:36,565
- Where's Ronnie?

911
00:56:40,362 --> 00:56:43,020
- What happened?

912
00:56:43,054 --> 00:56:45,056
- You stay the
fuck away from us.

913
00:56:45,091 --> 00:56:47,024
- What is with your
family and stabbing me?

914
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:48,577
- Where were you just now?

915
00:56:48,612 --> 00:56:51,028
- In the bathroom, where
I just came out of.

916
00:56:51,062 --> 00:56:54,928
- I thought you took
a leak in the woods.

917
00:56:59,485 --> 00:57:01,590
- Okay.

918
00:57:01,625 --> 00:57:04,628
You got me.

919
00:57:07,665 --> 00:57:11,393
I was watching Nicole shower.

920
00:57:13,015 --> 00:57:16,640
- I'm going to vomit.

921
00:57:20,506 --> 00:57:24,682
- You don't leave our sight
again, do you understand?

922
00:57:26,960 --> 00:57:30,136
Stop doing that!

923
00:57:31,896 --> 00:57:36,591
[creepy music]

924
00:57:39,352 --> 00:57:43,943
- Are we just gonna
leave his head out there?

925
00:57:45,220 --> 00:57:47,878
- We can bury it tomorrow.

926
00:57:47,912 --> 00:57:52,227
- I'm sure as hell
not gonna touch it.

927
00:57:55,161 --> 00:57:56,403
- Just wait 'til tomorrow
morning and we can

928
00:57:56,438 --> 00:57:59,959
find the sheriff, okay?

929
00:58:02,927 --> 00:58:07,484
[ominous music]

930
00:58:39,412 --> 00:58:44,417
[slow, mellow music]

931
00:59:08,614 --> 00:59:12,721
[bike bell rings]

932
00:59:25,700 --> 00:59:28,737
[clown laughing]

933
00:59:29,669 --> 00:59:33,293
- Hey Lover Boy, why don't
you join us down here?

934
00:59:33,328 --> 00:59:35,606
Everyone floats.

935
00:59:35,641 --> 00:59:38,678
Down here, we all float.

936
00:59:38,713 --> 00:59:41,612
[clown laughs]

937
00:59:44,270 --> 00:59:47,929
Soul fist, redrum!

938
00:59:50,310 --> 00:59:51,657
- What is it, what's wrong?

939
00:59:51,691 --> 00:59:52,796
- Where's Nicole?

940
00:59:52,830 --> 00:59:54,073
- God, you're kidding me.

941
00:59:54,107 --> 00:59:55,522
- She's probably still
asleep in her bed.

942
00:59:55,557 --> 00:59:57,835
- What, with that
head in the window?

943
00:59:57,870 --> 01:00:00,217
- [whispering loudly] Nicole!

944
01:00:00,251 --> 01:00:02,633
Nicole!

945
01:00:02,668 --> 01:00:04,566
- You don't think she
went for the boat, do you?

946
01:00:04,601 --> 01:00:05,774
- Why the boat?

947
01:00:05,809 --> 01:00:07,396
- She thought it would be safer.

948
01:00:07,431 --> 01:00:09,329
- Oh, god.

949
01:00:09,364 --> 01:00:10,330
[Hilary gasps]

950
01:00:10,365 --> 01:00:12,678
What?

951
01:00:13,299 --> 01:00:15,957
Oh, fuck, the
front door is open.

952
01:00:15,991 --> 01:00:17,199
Come on Ronnie, let's
go, it'll be safer

953
01:00:17,234 --> 01:00:18,511
if we go together.

954
01:00:18,545 --> 01:00:20,651
- It'll be safer
if we stay in here.

955
01:00:20,686 --> 01:00:23,309
- Ronnie.

956
01:00:23,343 --> 01:00:27,209
- Or we could all go together.

957
01:00:27,244 --> 01:00:31,179
[boat engine roars,
then fades away]

958
01:00:34,354 --> 01:00:35,390
- She started the boat.

959
01:00:35,424 --> 01:00:36,460
- I don't see her.

960
01:00:36,494 --> 01:00:38,427
- Me either.

961
01:00:38,462 --> 01:00:41,603
Oh my god, I can't
believe she left us.

962
01:00:41,638 --> 01:00:44,226
- Oh god, no she didn't.

963
01:00:58,447 --> 01:01:01,450
Nicole?

964
01:01:07,491 --> 01:01:10,563
- Beach World.

965
01:01:13,290 --> 01:01:14,705
The main character ends
up going on a planet

966
01:01:14,740 --> 01:01:17,087
filled with sand and ends
up shoving piles of sand

967
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:19,503
down his throat.

968
01:01:19,537 --> 01:01:21,643
- You did this to her.

969
01:01:21,678 --> 01:01:22,886
- Hilary.

970
01:01:22,920 --> 01:01:24,611
- You're never around
when any of them die.

971
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:26,027
Or when Lamont's head showed up.

972
01:01:26,061 --> 01:01:27,200
- Not around, I was in the
cabin when Nicole died.

973
01:01:27,235 --> 01:01:28,374
- Were you?

974
01:01:28,408 --> 01:01:29,720
Because I'm pretty
sure I fell asleep.

975
01:01:29,755 --> 01:01:32,033
Were you awake the
whole night, huh?

976
01:01:32,067 --> 01:01:33,897
- I think I fell asleep
for a little while.

977
01:01:33,931 --> 01:01:35,657
- Long enough for
you to kill Nicole.

978
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:37,107
- This--you gotta be kidding me.

979
01:01:37,141 --> 01:01:38,556
Monroe.

980
01:01:38,591 --> 01:01:40,593
- You come near me, I will
stab you in the throat.

981
01:01:40,627 --> 01:01:44,770
Is that in any of
your fucking books?

982
01:01:45,218 --> 01:01:46,633
- You believe me I mean,
whoever killed Nicole

983
01:01:46,668 --> 01:01:49,084
took the boat and drove
off, you saw that.

984
01:01:49,119 --> 01:01:50,637
- I told you not
to leave our sight.

985
01:01:50,672 --> 01:01:51,777
- Yeah, but it's not like--

986
01:01:51,811 --> 01:01:56,540
- I told you not
to leave our sight.

987
01:02:03,789 --> 01:02:06,826
- You need help with that?

988
01:02:06,861 --> 01:02:10,036
- No.

989
01:02:16,525 --> 01:02:19,011
This doesn't look
good for you, Ronnie.

990
01:02:19,045 --> 01:02:20,909
- I can't believe you
think I killed our friends.

991
01:02:20,944 --> 01:02:21,772
- Friends?

992
01:02:21,807 --> 01:02:23,015
You hated Lamont.

993
01:02:23,049 --> 01:02:24,223
- Well not as much as
I hate other people,

994
01:02:24,257 --> 01:02:25,327
so that puts him in
my friend category.

995
01:02:25,362 --> 01:02:26,777
- She's right.

996
01:02:26,812 --> 01:02:28,675
You're never around
when they die.

997
01:02:28,710 --> 01:02:29,780
- Neither are you guys.

998
01:02:29,815 --> 01:02:30,747
- Yes, but we've
always been together

999
01:02:30,781 --> 01:02:32,196
whenever the killings occur.

1000
01:02:32,231 --> 01:02:35,027
- So maybe you're
both the killers.

1001
01:02:36,822 --> 01:02:39,203
I mean, why would I kill
Nicole, out of all people?

1002
01:02:39,238 --> 01:02:41,171
- To bring some sick
fantasy to life.

1003
01:02:41,205 --> 01:02:42,655
- I was asleep next
to you, you think your

1004
01:02:42,689 --> 01:02:44,139
Army Power Ranger
senses would detect

1005
01:02:44,174 --> 01:02:45,485
someone moving around.

1006
01:02:45,520 --> 01:02:46,417
- Everything fits.

1007
01:02:46,452 --> 01:02:47,660
- Everything does not fit.

1008
01:02:47,694 --> 01:02:48,834
- You read all those
Stephen King books.

1009
01:02:48,868 --> 01:02:50,076
- So what, I also
watch a lot of porn,

1010
01:02:50,111 --> 01:02:51,077
you don't see me fucking
Tori Black, do you?

1011
01:02:51,112 --> 01:02:53,217
- Get in my fucking pussy, yeah!

1012
01:02:53,252 --> 01:02:54,874
- Okay, not that I
wouldn't if I could,

1013
01:02:54,909 --> 01:02:57,532
so probably not
the best example.

1014
01:02:57,566 --> 01:02:58,844
- I think I believe him.

1015
01:02:58,878 --> 01:03:00,466
- Of course, who
wouldn't fuck Tori Black?

1016
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:02,399
- Oh my god Ronnie, I think I
believe you're not the killer.

1017
01:03:02,433 --> 01:03:05,747
- Oh, thank you.

1018
01:03:06,437 --> 01:03:08,060
- Why would he kill them,
what does he have to gain?

1019
01:03:08,094 --> 01:03:10,717
- Like I said, to bring some
sick Stephen King fantasy

1020
01:03:10,752 --> 01:03:12,616
into his boring, pathetic life.

1021
01:03:12,650 --> 01:03:17,000
- Look, I know he's pathetic.

1022
01:03:17,034 --> 01:03:19,002
And disgusting, and perverted--

1023
01:03:19,036 --> 01:03:21,659
- Hey, sitting right here, okay?

1024
01:03:21,694 --> 01:03:22,902
By the way, it's that
kind of mean-spirited talk

1025
01:03:22,937 --> 01:03:24,455
that turns people
into serial killers.

1026
01:03:24,490 --> 01:03:25,698
- Yeah, and it's comments
like that, that are not

1027
01:03:25,732 --> 01:03:28,252
helping your situation.

1028
01:03:28,287 --> 01:03:29,736
Alright, how are we
gonna settle this?

1029
01:03:29,771 --> 01:03:31,911
- Club him over the head and
wait for the sheriff to arrive.

1030
01:03:31,946 --> 01:03:33,637
- Well, we're not getting a
unanimous vote on that one.

1031
01:03:33,671 --> 01:03:34,603
- All we need is a majority.

1032
01:03:34,638 --> 01:03:36,502
- Alright, enough.

1033
01:03:36,536 --> 01:03:38,642
We'll just watch each other
until the sheriff arrives.

1034
01:03:38,676 --> 01:03:39,850
- What if the
sheriff never comes?

1035
01:03:39,885 --> 01:03:40,747
- What if the
sheriff's the killer?

1036
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:41,956
- What if you're the killer?

1037
01:03:41,990 --> 01:03:43,371
- Then Lamont would have
been the first to go.

1038
01:03:43,405 --> 01:03:46,995
- Look, assuming it's not
Ronnie, which I might,

1039
01:03:47,030 --> 01:03:49,066
perhaps, maybe believe--

1040
01:03:49,101 --> 01:03:50,481
- Might perhaps maybe?

1041
01:03:50,516 --> 01:03:52,069
- Then who are
the other options?

1042
01:03:52,104 --> 01:03:53,657
- I don't know, what about
the creepy pedophile guy

1043
01:03:53,691 --> 01:03:55,901
at the marina, or the
creepy waitress, or anyone

1044
01:03:55,935 --> 01:03:59,111
in this town prefaced
with with the word creepy?

1045
01:03:59,145 --> 01:04:00,629
- I guess there's the
game warden that we saw

1046
01:04:00,664 --> 01:04:01,768
on the lake yesterday.

1047
01:04:01,803 --> 01:04:03,460
- Yeah, the creepy game warden!

1048
01:04:03,494 --> 01:04:05,669
He probably took the boat.

1049
01:04:05,703 --> 01:04:09,328
I mean, anyone in this
town could be the killer.

1050
01:04:13,297 --> 01:04:16,128
Anyone.

1051
01:04:16,335 --> 01:04:18,233
- Who knows?

1052
01:04:18,268 --> 01:04:19,648
Maybe just living in
this queer little town

1053
01:04:19,683 --> 01:04:23,273
with nothing to do is enough
to drive somebody crazy.

1054
01:04:23,307 --> 01:04:28,036
- All work and no play
makes Jack a dull boy.

1055
01:04:28,071 --> 01:04:31,626
- Apparently someone really
wants it quiet around here.

1056
01:04:31,660 --> 01:04:34,042
- If he's telling the truth,
and I'm not saying he is,

1057
01:04:34,077 --> 01:04:37,597
but if he is, that means
someone else is out there.

1058
01:04:37,632 --> 01:04:40,014
- Yeah that's true, we
need to protect ourselves.

1059
01:04:40,048 --> 01:04:41,222
You know if there's
anything that I learned

1060
01:04:41,256 --> 01:04:42,119
when I was in Iraq--

1061
01:04:42,154 --> 01:04:43,293
- Iraq?

1062
01:04:43,327 --> 01:04:44,535
I thought you were a line cook.

1063
01:04:44,570 --> 01:04:46,020
- Yes, so was Steven
Segal in Under Siege,

1064
01:04:46,054 --> 01:04:48,056
do you doubt him?

1065
01:04:48,091 --> 01:04:50,369
I was a line cook in a
Ranger regiment, okay?

1066
01:04:50,403 --> 01:04:52,785
- Great, we can kill
him with your lasagna.

1067
01:04:52,819 --> 01:04:54,476
- Okay, regardless.

1068
01:04:54,511 --> 01:04:57,445
The best defense
is a good offense.

1069
01:04:57,479 --> 01:04:59,102
- Monroe's right.

1070
01:04:59,136 --> 01:05:00,862
We have to catch him.

1071
01:05:00,897 --> 01:05:05,211
- We need to set a trap, we
need to attract him in some way.

1072
01:05:05,246 --> 01:05:07,489
We need to come up with
some plan that would appeal

1073
01:05:07,524 --> 01:05:10,941
to his sick and
twisted imagination.

1074
01:05:10,976 --> 01:05:12,356
- I know.

1075
01:05:12,391 --> 01:05:14,117
Let's set something up out
of a Stephen King story.

1076
01:05:14,151 --> 01:05:15,428
- Oh, why didn't
I think of that?

1077
01:05:15,463 --> 01:05:16,809
- Because you have a tiny brain.

1078
01:05:16,843 --> 01:05:18,190
- Actually, if he's
trying to kill us

1079
01:05:18,224 --> 01:05:19,329
using identical murders

1080
01:05:19,363 --> 01:05:21,089
from King novels...

1081
01:05:21,124 --> 01:05:23,333
- He'll love the simplicity
of having it set up for him.

1082
01:05:23,367 --> 01:05:26,957
- I gotta admit, it's
a pretty good idea.

1083
01:05:26,992 --> 01:05:29,787
Can you come up with
anything better?

1084
01:05:29,822 --> 01:05:32,825
- We need to use
your grandparents'
Stephen King library.

1085
01:05:36,794 --> 01:05:41,765
- Why do our grandparents
have a Stephen King library?

1086
01:05:51,430 --> 01:05:53,087
- How long is this
gonna take, Ronnie?

1087
01:05:53,121 --> 01:05:54,674
- I think I got it.

1088
01:05:54,709 --> 01:05:55,779
You guys remember Last
Rung on the Ladder

1089
01:05:55,813 --> 01:05:59,231
in King's Night Shift?

1090
01:06:00,508 --> 01:06:03,304
I feel sad for people like you.

1091
01:06:03,338 --> 01:06:04,477
It's a story about
a brother and sister

1092
01:06:04,512 --> 01:06:06,238
who climb a ladder
to go to a barn?

1093
01:06:06,272 --> 01:06:07,687
- Well that's a good start.

1094
01:06:07,722 --> 01:06:09,241
- The sister climbs up the
ladder, she gets stuck,

1095
01:06:09,275 --> 01:06:10,518
dangling on the top rung.

1096
01:06:10,552 --> 01:06:11,898
- I'm not throwing
myself off a ladder.

1097
01:06:11,933 --> 01:06:13,383
- No no no, the brother
ends up saving her life

1098
01:06:13,417 --> 01:06:15,040
by putting hay at the bottom.

1099
01:06:15,074 --> 01:06:16,282
- So, no one dies?

1100
01:06:16,317 --> 01:06:17,283
- Well, when she
grows up she ends up

1101
01:06:17,318 --> 01:06:19,837
throwing herself off a building.

1102
01:06:19,872 --> 01:06:21,494
- I'm not dangling
from a ladder.

1103
01:06:21,529 --> 01:06:22,668
- Look, you don't have to.

1104
01:06:22,702 --> 01:06:25,015
We don't have to be
completely accurate.

1105
01:06:25,050 --> 01:06:26,154
Just trust me, I'm
not gonna let anything

1106
01:06:26,189 --> 01:06:29,088
happen to you, okay?

1107
01:06:29,123 --> 01:06:30,814
Alright, here's the plan.

1108
01:06:30,848 --> 01:06:32,609
We're gonna go in the
barn, you're gonna

1109
01:06:32,643 --> 01:06:35,232
climb up the hayloft,
start making lots of noise,

1110
01:06:35,267 --> 01:06:36,889
start pushing things
around, pretend like

1111
01:06:36,923 --> 01:06:38,270
you're looking for something--

1112
01:06:38,304 --> 01:06:41,307
- Sing, scream, then he'll
have to come get you.

1113
01:06:41,342 --> 01:06:43,413
- How do you know it's a he?

1114
01:06:43,447 --> 01:06:44,793
- Or a she.

1115
01:06:44,828 --> 01:06:45,898
- Ronnie, is there something
you're not telling us?

1116
01:06:45,932 --> 01:06:47,244
- No!

1117
01:06:47,279 --> 01:06:48,487
90 percent of serial
killers are Caucasian men

1118
01:06:48,521 --> 01:06:51,248
between 25 and 35 years of age.

1119
01:06:51,283 --> 01:06:52,939
- And don't you fall
into that category?

1120
01:06:52,974 --> 01:06:54,769
- Don't you?

1121
01:06:54,803 --> 01:06:55,908
- Hil!

1122
01:06:55,942 --> 01:06:57,254
Guys.

1123
01:06:57,289 --> 01:07:00,913
I don't care if it's a
he, or a she, or an It.

1124
01:07:00,947 --> 01:07:02,052
[clown laughs]

1125
01:07:02,087 --> 01:07:04,054
- Oh god, not the clown.

1126
01:07:04,089 --> 01:07:05,849
- We're gonna go into the barn.

1127
01:07:05,883 --> 01:07:08,645
We're going to hide, and
when the killer comes out,

1128
01:07:08,679 --> 01:07:10,302
I'm going to stab him.

1129
01:07:10,336 --> 01:07:12,718
- What, no!

1130
01:07:15,376 --> 01:07:17,723
- No?

1131
01:07:17,757 --> 01:07:21,830
- I mean, if we kill him,
we're no better than he is.

1132
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:23,315
Look, maybe he needs help.

1133
01:07:23,349 --> 01:07:27,319
Maybe he was hit by a car and
hasn't been the same since.

1134
01:07:27,353 --> 01:07:31,185
Look, whoever did this
doesn't deserve to die.

1135
01:07:33,049 --> 01:07:33,773
Great!

1136
01:07:33,808 --> 01:07:36,604
Alright, let's go.

1137
01:07:40,021 --> 01:07:41,471
What now?

1138
01:07:41,505 --> 01:07:44,094
- It's not that we don't
trust you, it's uh,

1139
01:07:44,129 --> 01:07:45,026
it's just that--

1140
01:07:45,061 --> 01:07:46,786
- We don't trust you.

1141
01:07:46,821 --> 01:07:48,754
You already told us how
to catch the killer so,

1142
01:07:48,788 --> 01:07:51,446
if you're not him, you should
have nothing to worry about.

1143
01:07:51,481 --> 01:07:52,896
- Yeah, except the maniacal
maniac on the loose!

1144
01:07:52,930 --> 01:07:55,071
- I'm willing to bet that if
you're tied to that chair,

1145
01:07:55,105 --> 01:07:56,900
the killer never shows up.

1146
01:07:56,934 --> 01:07:58,281
- Really.

1147
01:07:58,315 --> 01:07:59,696
Now you're willing to
bet your life on it?

1148
01:07:59,730 --> 01:08:02,181
- Get the rope.

1149
01:08:02,216 --> 01:08:03,631
- Hey wait a second,
it's not my fault

1150
01:08:03,665 --> 01:08:07,945
that Jean-Claude van Suck
over here fucked up again.

1151
01:08:10,569 --> 01:08:11,949
- Sit in the chair, Ronnie.

1152
01:08:11,984 --> 01:08:13,330
- Okay, look, I didn't
mean it, I didn't mean it.

1153
01:08:13,365 --> 01:08:15,125
I'm sure you didn't mean
to get your platoon killed.

1154
01:08:15,160 --> 01:08:19,957
- Sit in the god
damn chair, Ronnie.

1155
01:08:25,653 --> 01:08:26,792
- Okay, just not too
tight, I don't want to

1156
01:08:26,826 --> 01:08:28,000
have any circula--

1157
01:08:28,034 --> 01:08:31,831
I want my apology
steak medium well,

1158
01:08:31,866 --> 01:08:34,696
smothered in a grilled
I'm sorry onion, ow!

1159
01:08:34,731 --> 01:08:37,630
- Shut, up, Ronnie.

1160
01:08:40,150 --> 01:08:41,358
- No wait.

1161
01:08:41,393 --> 01:08:43,912
I know who the killer is!

1162
01:08:47,502 --> 01:08:52,507
[Ronnie hums the Jeopardy theme]

1163
01:09:08,558 --> 01:09:09,973
Ow!

1164
01:09:10,007 --> 01:09:11,043
It's Stephen King.

1165
01:09:11,077 --> 01:09:13,183
The killer is Stephen King.

1166
01:09:13,218 --> 01:09:16,186
No, I'm serious, it really is--

1167
01:09:16,773 --> 01:09:19,327
- You're an idiot.

1168
01:09:19,362 --> 01:09:24,090
- Mmmph, hmmph!

[ominous music]

1170
01:10:12,829 --> 01:10:14,831
- What?

1171
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:18,835
- Just climb the ladder and
wait for my signal, okay?

1172
01:10:19,594 --> 01:10:22,287
- Are you okay?

1173
01:10:23,011 --> 01:10:24,979
- Yeah.

1174
01:10:25,013 --> 01:10:28,569
Don't worry, sis.

1175
01:10:28,603 --> 01:10:32,124
The old Monroe is back.

1176
01:10:37,129 --> 01:10:39,200
Go on.

- Come on!

1181
01:11:30,216 --> 01:11:32,460
Come on, where are you?

1182
01:11:32,495 --> 01:11:34,255
I know you're here!

1183
01:11:34,290 --> 01:11:36,050

But I bet you never
expected this ending.

- What the fuck, Ronnie?

1203
01:14:08,547 --> 01:14:10,307
- I'm sorry, Monroe.

1204
01:14:10,342 --> 01:14:13,276
I just can't let you
kill Stephen King.

1205
01:14:13,310 --> 01:14:16,003
- He killed all of our
friends, you asshole.

1206
01:14:16,037 --> 01:14:17,936
- Well then, we'll turn him in.

1207
01:14:17,970 --> 01:14:20,663
At least he can keep
writing from jail.

Monroe, please, stay away,
you're scaring me, okay?

You hit me with a
fucking shovel, Ronnie?
