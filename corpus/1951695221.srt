1
00:00:39,400 --> 00:00:42,100
Hey, could you stop snoring?

2
00:00:42,200 --> 00:00:43,400
Thank you. Yeah.

3
00:00:43,400 --> 00:00:45,700
I think it's the breathing through the nose.

4
00:01:22,600 --> 00:01:24,900
That's it, that's it. Just a little bit more.

5
00:01:27,400 --> 00:01:29,500
Come on, it's easy. Just...

6
00:01:32,600 --> 00:01:34,800
Fine, suit yourself, dog breath.

7
00:01:38,600 --> 00:01:40,100
What have you been eating?

8
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:55,800
Yeah.

9
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:57,800
There you are.

10
00:01:58,800 --> 00:02:01,100
Present and accounted for.

11
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,800
Yes, I will let you in this time.

12
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:05,000
What surprise?

13
00:02:06,200 --> 00:02:08,200
No, no, no, I don't like surprises.

14
00:02:08,300 --> 00:02:09,400
All right, I like surprises.

15
00:02:09,400 --> 00:02:11,600
I just don't like not knowing
what they are in advance.

16
00:02:11,700 --> 00:02:13,600
Yeah, I know it's not.

17
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,400
What?

18
00:02:18,600 --> 00:02:20,000
Nothing.

19
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:22,100
What are you doing?

20
00:02:22,200 --> 00:02:24,300
Great, 11:00.

21
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:25,900
I'll be ready.

22
00:02:35,000 --> 00:02:36,300
All right.

23
00:02:41,800 --> 00:02:43,200
There we go.

24
00:02:57,700 --> 00:03:00,100
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.

25
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:17,800
Hey, loser! It's me!

26
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:27,800
Mmm?

27
00:03:37,600 --> 00:03:39,100
Hello.

28
00:03:42,900 --> 00:03:44,700
Where are you?

29
00:03:44,800 --> 00:03:46,500
Don't be an idiot.

30
00:04:01,100 --> 00:04:04,100
Did you see that guy?
He was right behind you.

31
00:04:07,300 --> 00:04:09,500
I'm so sorry.
I thought he was following you.

32
00:04:09,600 --> 00:04:10,700
He was following me.

33
00:04:10,700 --> 00:04:12,900
Exactly! That's what made me think
he was following you.

34
00:04:12,900 --> 00:04:14,000
Because I invited him.

35
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,200
Well, how am I supposed to know that?

36
00:04:15,200 --> 00:04:17,500
You're a clever boy,
you could have worked it out.

37
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:19,500
He was hiding in the bushes.

38
00:04:19,500 --> 00:04:22,000
- Dropped the keys.
- I told you I had a surprise.

39
00:04:22,100 --> 00:04:23,600
Try not to ruin my shoes, they're new.

40
00:04:23,700 --> 00:04:25,100
I'm sorry, but why would your surprise be

41
00:04:25,100 --> 00:04:27,200
a weird-looking creepy guy
sneaking around the house?

42
00:04:27,300 --> 00:04:29,300
- It wouldn't.
- Good 'cause I wouldn't want that.

43
00:04:30,900 --> 00:04:32,500
Found the keys.

44
00:04:33,400 --> 00:04:36,800
Ryan, I'd like you
to meet my brother, Patrick.

45
00:04:36,800 --> 00:04:41,800
Ryan, I'm so sorry about the whole
cricket-batting-your-head thing.

46
00:04:41,900 --> 00:04:44,500
These things happen. Pleased to meet you.

47
00:04:44,500 --> 00:04:47,500
Patrick, I'd like you
to meet my fiancé, Ryan.

48
00:04:48,300 --> 00:04:49,500
Fiancé?

49
00:04:50,200 --> 00:04:51,600
Fiancé.

50
00:04:52,500 --> 00:04:54,400
We're getting married!

51
00:05:04,000 --> 00:05:07,500
Patrick, Marilyn has told me
so much about you.

52
00:05:08,100 --> 00:05:09,300
She never mentioned you.

53
00:05:09,400 --> 00:05:11,700
- Patrick!
- What, Marilyn?

54
00:05:11,700 --> 00:05:14,100
Ryan and I have been working
on this show together for two years.

55
00:05:14,200 --> 00:05:15,800
I'm his makeup artist. You know that.

56
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:17,900
<i>- StarCrossed.
- Yes, the space soap.</i>

57
00:05:17,900 --> 00:05:19,300
- You've seen it.
- Yes, once.

58
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:21,400
- Yeah?
- It was by accident.

59
00:05:23,300 --> 00:05:26,200
Well, we met on the show,

60
00:05:27,200 --> 00:05:29,700
and I fell in love with Mookie
the moment I laid eyes on her.

61
00:05:29,800 --> 00:05:31,000
Mookie.

62
00:05:31,100 --> 00:05:34,100
- Lxnay on the Ookiemay.
- Okay way.

63
00:05:34,200 --> 00:05:36,600
I'm not sure your code is secure.

64
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,200
You don't wanna know what she calls me.

65
00:05:39,300 --> 00:05:41,100
No, no, I don't.

66
00:05:41,200 --> 00:05:44,300
- I call you Ryan?
- No.

67
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:47,300
Pepe?

68
00:05:47,300 --> 00:05:49,000
No, the other one.

69
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,700
You know.

70
00:05:53,600 --> 00:05:55,700
You are so dead.

71
00:05:58,100 --> 00:05:59,600
- So, he's staying?
- Oh, yeah.

72
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,500
- Well, he can't have my room.
- He doesn't want your room.

73
00:06:01,600 --> 00:06:02,600
What's wrong with it?

74
00:06:02,700 --> 00:06:05,100
- I'm sure it's a nice room.
- It's a great room.

75
00:06:05,100 --> 00:06:08,500
It's just that
Marilyn and I are gonna be married,

76
00:06:08,600 --> 00:06:12,100
and we're used to
sleeping in the same room.

77
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,400
We can share.

78
00:06:13,500 --> 00:06:16,100
- I don't wanna share. That's weird.
- Marilyn and I can share.

79
00:06:16,100 --> 00:06:17,900
- Well, then, I'll take my room.
- Let it go, Patrick.

80
00:06:17,900 --> 00:06:21,000
The room that shares a wall
with your room.

81
00:06:22,200 --> 00:06:23,900
Hey, check it out.

82
00:06:26,100 --> 00:06:27,600
Hey!

83
00:06:29,700 --> 00:06:34,400
I have to go over there.

84
00:06:45,100 --> 00:06:47,800
I don't think we exactly hit it off.

85
00:06:47,900 --> 00:06:51,000
It's okay, honey.
Patrick's just a little strange.

86
00:06:56,700 --> 00:06:58,800
Okay, a lot strange.

87
00:07:05,200 --> 00:07:06,300
Yeah.

88
00:07:07,000 --> 00:07:08,500
He's a psycho.

89
00:07:12,100 --> 00:07:13,700
He'll come around.

90
00:07:15,200 --> 00:07:17,500
How can he not?

91
00:07:23,500 --> 00:07:26,200
Where did Mom and Dad's furniture go?

92
00:07:26,300 --> 00:07:28,200
What do you mean?

93
00:07:28,200 --> 00:07:30,400
What did you do with the furniture?

94
00:07:30,500 --> 00:07:31,500
Well, it's funny you should ask.

95
00:07:31,600 --> 00:07:33,600
There are these things
called Internet auctions.

96
00:07:33,700 --> 00:07:35,900
- Love them, they're wicked.
- And addictive.

97
00:07:35,900 --> 00:07:39,000
You sold the furniture?
You sold Mom and Dad's furniture?

98
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,700
- A ton of other stuff, too.
- Stuff they left for us, both of us.

99
00:07:41,800 --> 00:07:43,500
Well, believe it or not,
there are people out there

100
00:07:43,600 --> 00:07:45,700
who don't just think
that all that junk is garbage.

101
00:07:45,700 --> 00:07:48,500
- That it's worth something.
- You mean, people like me.

102
00:07:48,600 --> 00:07:50,300
Hang on a sec.

103
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:52,000
Just one second.

104
00:07:57,500 --> 00:07:58,600
Oh!

105
00:07:59,200 --> 00:08:00,700
Is he sweet or what?

106
00:08:00,800 --> 00:08:02,200
I'll go with "or what."

107
00:08:02,300 --> 00:08:04,100
He's nervous.

108
00:08:04,200 --> 00:08:07,300
If you screw this up for me, I'll kill you.
I mean it, be normal.

109
00:08:07,400 --> 00:08:09,600
- I am just being myself.
- Right, instead be normal.

110
00:08:09,700 --> 00:08:11,900
I'm sorry, it's just kind of hard because...
Look at him.

111
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,400
I mean, what is this, some kind of a joke?

112
00:08:13,400 --> 00:08:16,100
- He's a gentleman, and I love him.
- He's an actor.

113
00:08:16,200 --> 00:08:17,900
- So what?
- So he lies for a living.

114
00:08:18,000 --> 00:08:19,200
Not to me he doesn't.

115
00:08:19,300 --> 00:08:21,500
- How do you know?
- Patrick, I know.

116
00:08:21,600 --> 00:08:24,500
He's a pro. Look, people like you,
you're not gonna see it coming.

117
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,300
You don't stand a chance.
They train for this kind of thing.

118
00:08:32,000 --> 00:08:34,500
- Here you go, chief.
- What is this?

119
00:08:35,000 --> 00:08:37,100
Season 2, enough said.

120
00:08:37,800 --> 00:08:39,600
No, no, I think I'll need a little more.

121
00:08:39,900 --> 00:08:41,500

137
00:09:38,200 --> 00:09:39,800
Well, can't be as bad as the last one.

138
00:09:39,800 --> 00:09:40,900
Go.

139
00:09:41,000 --> 00:09:42,900

- Karaoke!

140
00:09:45,100 --> 00:09:46,500

<i>Come on, virgins first.</i>

146
00:10:01,900 --> 00:10:03,900
Why would you tell him that?

147
00:10:05,400 --> 00:10:06,400
Think I'm missing something.

148
00:10:06,500 --> 00:10:09,000
- Where are you going?
- To let the dog out.

149
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:12,000
<i>Who let the dogs out?</i>

150
00:10:17,500 --> 00:10:19,500
They're still going.

151
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,100
Take your time.

152
00:10:22,200 --> 00:10:24,000
Go again if you want.

153
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,900
Mars?

154
00:10:28,100 --> 00:10:29,300
Mars?

155
00:10:29,900 --> 00:10:31,800
Oh, come on, where are you?

156
00:10:32,800 --> 00:10:34,300
Oh, there you are!

157
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,100
What're you doing, lad?

158
00:10:37,600 --> 00:10:40,600
They're still singing. Yep, it's you and me.

159
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:43,900
What have you found? Let's go see.
Come on.

160
00:10:45,700 --> 00:10:47,100
Is it dead?

161
00:10:52,600 --> 00:10:55,200
Boy, I wish
I could sleep. You guys asleep?

162
00:10:55,300 --> 00:10:58,500
Yes, Patrick, we're asleep. Now shut up.

163
00:10:58,600 --> 00:10:59,700
Hello!

164
00:11:00,300 --> 00:11:01,300
Is that you, Marilyn?

165
00:11:02,500 --> 00:11:05,000
Shut up and go to sleep.

166
00:11:05,100 --> 00:11:09,100
I'm doing a lot of tossing and turning.
I hope it's not keeping you guys up.

167
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:14,900
I guess we're not going to,
you know, tonight.

168
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:18,700
Sorry, I didn't hear that.

169
00:11:19,400 --> 00:11:21,300
What was the last part?

170
00:11:21,800 --> 00:11:22,800
Say again.

171
00:11:34,600 --> 00:11:36,800
Oh, come on.

172
00:11:38,800 --> 00:11:40,000
Morning.

173
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:44,300
That is just...

174
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:45,600
No!

175
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,300
- Better than naked.
- Barely.

176
00:11:48,400 --> 00:11:50,400
Hey, I'm making breakfast. You want in?

177
00:11:50,500 --> 00:11:52,200
What is it, vegetarian?

178
00:11:52,300 --> 00:11:55,500
No, this is for the crazy
nothing-with-a-face Mookie diet.

179
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:56,800
What about fish?

180
00:11:56,900 --> 00:11:59,200
- What about them?
- She eats fish. Fish have faces.

181
00:11:59,300 --> 00:12:02,200
- Not cute, little, furry faces.
- Cute, little, fishy faces.

182
00:12:02,200 --> 00:12:04,000
Hey, man, she's your sister.

183
00:12:04,100 --> 00:12:06,500
This is for her.

184
00:12:06,500 --> 00:12:07,800
And this

185
00:12:09,400 --> 00:12:10,900
Is for us.

186
00:12:11,000 --> 00:12:12,300
You hungry?

187
00:12:13,200 --> 00:12:15,400
I will never be hungry again.

188
00:12:17,700 --> 00:12:18,900
You sure?

189
00:12:22,000 --> 00:12:23,400
I could eat.

190
00:12:41,500 --> 00:12:43,500
Spider fight.

191
00:12:43,600 --> 00:12:47,000
Oh, you can run, little creature,
but you cannot hide.

192
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,900
And he makes it. What the...

193
00:13:15,800 --> 00:13:17,000
Hey there.

194
00:13:17,100 --> 00:13:20,300
- What are you doing?
- Getting ready for the Christmas lights.

195
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,300
Yes, but the spiders...
Now they could be anywhere.

196
00:13:23,600 --> 00:13:24,700
Whoa.

197
00:13:25,200 --> 00:13:27,500
Sorry, buddy. I gotta take this.

198
00:13:37,900 --> 00:13:39,600
Hi, there. Ryan here.

199
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:45,400
Baby, she's nothing to me. Nothing at all.

200
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:49,200
I need the freedom.
I need the heat that I get from you.

201
00:13:49,300 --> 00:13:51,500
Until she's gone, we'll never be together.

202
00:13:51,600 --> 00:13:54,600
With her out of the way,
we've got the world,

203
00:13:54,700 --> 00:13:57,200
the power to be who we wanna be.

204
00:13:59,100 --> 00:14:01,600
I know, I know. That's why I love you.

205
00:14:04,000 --> 00:14:06,200
I knew it. I knew it.

206
00:14:06,200 --> 00:14:07,800
He is a liar and a cheat.

207
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:10,600
He's probably gonna make a play
for the Internet auction money as well.

208
00:14:10,700 --> 00:14:11,800
Look at him.

209
00:14:11,900 --> 00:14:14,600
Look at him, he's out there talking
about getting rid of my little sister,

210
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:16,700
and you, you fell for it!

211
00:14:36,600 --> 00:14:39,400
What forms are those?
Is that tae kwon do?

212
00:14:41,300 --> 00:14:44,000
- Not exactly.
- I recognize some of the moves.

213
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,500
Maybe you do,
or maybe you just say you do.

214
00:14:48,700 --> 00:14:50,500
Where did you train?

215
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,500
Right here.

216
00:14:54,100 --> 00:14:56,000
- I'm sorry?
- Video games.

217
00:14:56,700 --> 00:14:59,500
Deadly martial arts,
punching ones, mostly.

218
00:15:00,600 --> 00:15:02,500
That's different.

219
00:15:02,600 --> 00:15:04,200
I'm a human Xbox.

220
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:06,700
Really?

221
00:15:06,800 --> 00:15:08,400
Well, I guess that could be
a good way to learn.

222
00:15:08,500 --> 00:15:09,700
You?

223
00:15:09,800 --> 00:15:14,400
Oh, I just did a little fight choreography,
a bit of karate, out at Burbank.

224
00:15:18,700 --> 00:15:20,700
Oh, no, no, no, I couldn't.

225
00:15:27,300 --> 00:15:29,900
All right,
I guess I could do a little sparring.

226
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:51,800
No, really, I'm good. Thanks.

227
00:15:51,900 --> 00:15:54,100
- Come on. One round.
- I'm okay.

228
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:59,400
- What did you do?
- What did I do? I'm the one bleeding.

229
00:15:59,500 --> 00:16:02,600
We were sparring.
It was an accident. Tell her, Patrick.

230
00:16:03,600 --> 00:16:04,900
He hit me.

231
00:16:06,300 --> 00:16:07,400
Nice.

232
00:16:20,800 --> 00:16:24,600
What's stopping you now, actor boy, huh?
Not these brakes.

233
00:16:24,700 --> 00:16:26,200
What the...

234
00:16:27,000 --> 00:16:28,200
Oh, my.

235
00:16:28,900 --> 00:16:31,100
Oh, please don't hit my car.

236
00:16:32,700 --> 00:16:35,300
Please make my car have stopped it.

237
00:16:37,300 --> 00:16:39,400
Maybe slowed it down a bit?

238
00:16:49,300 --> 00:16:50,300
Hey.

239
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:52,100
Hey.

240
00:16:52,200 --> 00:16:53,700
What you doing?

241
00:16:56,400 --> 00:16:58,200
Of course, right, yeah.

242
00:16:58,300 --> 00:17:01,200
You're... The ax and the wood.

243
00:17:03,100 --> 00:17:05,300
- You wanted a hand?
- Please.

244
00:17:05,400 --> 00:17:07,700
- I used to love splitting logs.
- Really? That's nice.

245
00:17:07,700 --> 00:17:09,300
If you could just

246
00:17:10,300 --> 00:17:14,000
hold this steady for me,
it'll all be over so much quicker.

247
00:17:17,400 --> 00:17:20,000
- Don't miss.
- I won't.

248
00:17:30,000 --> 00:17:31,600
What have I done?

249
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:36,500
You okay?

250
00:17:38,700 --> 00:17:40,700
Hit your leg pretty hard.

251
00:17:47,900 --> 00:17:50,000
I guess we're good for wood.

252
00:18:03,100 --> 00:18:06,100
- I really need to talk to you.
- I'm listening.

253
00:18:08,100 --> 00:18:10,600
- What is that smell?
- Well, it wasn't me.

254
00:18:10,600 --> 00:18:13,900
- No, I didn't mean that.
- What did you mean?

255
00:18:13,900 --> 00:18:16,300
- Are you mad at me?
- I don't know. Should I be?

256
00:18:16,300 --> 00:18:18,900
If we're gonna fight, can you
at least let me know what it's about?

257
00:18:19,000 --> 00:18:21,600
- Or what, you gonna hit me?
- What? What would I... Oh, I get it.

258
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:24,000
No, no, no, maybe
we should just duke it out, huh?

259
00:18:24,100 --> 00:18:25,400
Don't you start.

260
00:18:25,400 --> 00:18:26,800
Why not? It worked so well with Patrick.

261
00:18:26,900 --> 00:18:28,200
No, seriously. Would you stop, please?

262
00:18:28,300 --> 00:18:29,700
Making him bleed will win him over.

263
00:18:29,800 --> 00:18:30,900
We've been through this.

264
00:18:31,000 --> 00:18:33,800
A brilliant, pugilist solution
to intra-family conflict.

265
00:18:33,900 --> 00:18:35,700
I never actually hit him.

266
00:18:35,800 --> 00:18:38,200
- Pugilist means hitting, right?
- Apparently.

267
00:18:38,200 --> 00:18:40,300
Mookie, I don't need for him
to be my best friend.

268
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:41,500
Good.

269
00:18:41,500 --> 00:18:43,600
I'd settle with just being able
to be in the same room as him.

270
00:18:43,700 --> 00:18:45,300
- Exactly.
- Without him wanting me dead.

271
00:18:45,300 --> 00:18:46,800
Here comes the melodrama.

272
00:18:46,900 --> 00:18:49,400
- Oh, that hurts.
- So does being karated in the nose.

273
00:18:50,600 --> 00:18:53,500
- Go away, we're fighting.
- I'll wait.

274
00:18:53,600 --> 00:18:56,700
See, this is exactly what I'm talking about.
Gas, that's the smell.

275
00:18:56,800 --> 00:18:58,800
Definitely gas.

276
00:18:58,800 --> 00:19:00,700
- Thought you might like a sundae.
- What?

277
00:19:00,800 --> 00:19:03,200
Spoons are in the kitchen by the oven.

278
00:19:04,500 --> 00:19:06,800
You're so cute with your little fists.

279
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,800
<i>MAN ON RADIO: That's a negative,
dispatch. Negative on the gas.</i>

280
00:19:09,900 --> 00:19:11,900
I just don't want it
to mess things up for us.

281
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,000
<i>How's that?</i>

282
00:19:13,100 --> 00:19:15,300
And by "it" you mean Patrick?

283
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:18,100
"It" seems more appropriate.

284
00:19:20,800 --> 00:19:23,500
<i>MAN 2: And all the burners? Over.</i>

285
00:19:23,600 --> 00:19:24,900
You cozy?

286
00:19:26,100 --> 00:19:29,500
<i>- I could be cozier.
- You need medical services? Over.</i>

287
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,100
Could you now?

288
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:35,200
<i>MAN 1:wandering around the house
with some kind of active firework. Over.</i>

289
00:19:37,000 --> 00:19:38,900
<i>MAN 2: You want police? Over.</i>

290
00:19:40,200 --> 00:19:42,900
<i>MAN 1: Hey, you ever watched
that show, StarCrossed?</i>

291
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,000
They should have it aired out in no time.

292
00:19:45,000 --> 00:19:47,500
<i>MAN 2: The space soap? Over.</i>

293
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:49,600
Is there another blanket?

294
00:19:52,100 --> 00:19:55,800
You are
so beautiful to me. Yes you are.

295
00:19:55,900 --> 00:19:57,700
Well, I hope you're not planning
on being up all night.

296
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,300
It's beddy-byes
for tired, little doggy woggy.

297
00:20:36,700 --> 00:20:39,700
Here we go. All right. Right.

298
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,600
Perfect.

299
00:20:48,600 --> 00:20:50,600
Take your time.

300
00:20:50,700 --> 00:20:52,400
Oh, no, no, no, it's not... I was...

301
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:54,200
- No, no, I wasn't. I was...
- I don't wanna know.

302
00:20:54,200 --> 00:20:55,900
- No, no, no, you can't go in there.
- I can't not.

303
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,400
Believe me,
it's no longer a matter of choice.

304
00:20:57,500 --> 00:20:58,700
No, I'm saving it for Ryan.

305
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:01,100
Excuse me? And excuse me.

306
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:04,000
No, no, no, you can't...

307
00:21:04,900 --> 00:21:06,100
Shoot.

308
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:07,700
Morning.

309
00:21:10,600 --> 00:21:14,500
Well, feel free to move around the house.
I'll save your place.

310
00:21:15,100 --> 00:21:16,300
Thanks.

311
00:21:19,400 --> 00:21:20,700
Freak.

312
00:21:20,800 --> 00:21:23,700
- Yeah, shower's just at the back there.
- Okay.

313
00:21:46,100 --> 00:21:48,900
- Yes!
- Oh, yeah, that's normal.

314
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,400
- Whoa, what're you doing?
- What?

315
00:21:51,500 --> 00:21:52,900
Well, the shower...
Aren't you running the shower?

316
00:21:53,000 --> 00:21:54,300
I am running a bath for Marilyn.

317
00:21:54,400 --> 00:21:56,000
- Hey, Mookie. Your bath's ready.
- Thanks.

318
00:21:56,100 --> 00:21:57,800
Are you gonna put those
Christmas lights up today?

319
00:21:57,900 --> 00:21:59,600
- Sure thing, babe.
- I don't do Christmas.

320
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,200
Well, Ryan does.

321
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,400
What did he do to you?
You know, don't answer that.

322
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:07,300
- Your brother thinks I should wash.
- Oh, I guess you're joining me.

323
00:22:07,300 --> 00:22:09,400
Oh, no. No. Not in the...

324
00:22:26,700 --> 00:22:29,100
- I got it.
- No, stop.

325
00:22:30,100 --> 00:22:32,900
No, that end. Not that end. Not that...

326
00:22:32,900 --> 00:22:35,800
Look, just please don't help.

327
00:22:42,300 --> 00:22:45,000
Right in the jingles, that's gotta hurt.

328
00:22:46,900 --> 00:22:48,900
I'll go get those lights.

329
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,600
What you doing?

330
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:57,300
Nothing.

331
00:22:59,000 --> 00:23:01,600
Getting the holiday home
ready for some fairy lights.

332
00:23:01,700 --> 00:23:06,000
I'd have gone with "Christmas lights."
But then again, I'm a guy, not an actor.

333
00:23:06,100 --> 00:23:08,500
- Well, be careful.
- Too late.

334
00:23:09,400 --> 00:23:11,200
I'm gonna go get some groceries.

335
00:23:11,300 --> 00:23:12,600
Call a cab?

336
00:23:14,000 --> 00:23:15,900
Why would I need a cab?

337
00:23:16,900 --> 00:23:18,300
No reason.

338
00:23:18,700 --> 00:23:20,300
Don't forget.

339
00:23:20,300 --> 00:23:22,600
Right, and I'll pick up a few odds and ends.

340
00:23:22,700 --> 00:23:25,300
Patrick, do you need anything?
Maybe a friend?

341
00:23:25,400 --> 00:23:27,900
I got everything I need right here.

342
00:23:28,500 --> 00:23:29,900
And there.

343
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:53,100
- All right, let's get cracking.
- Hack away, cracked actor.

344
00:23:55,000 --> 00:23:56,300
I'm sorry?

345
00:24:16,400 --> 00:24:20,100
- You off, sweetie?
- On foot, yes. Thank you very much.

346
00:24:21,700 --> 00:24:23,800
At least no one was hurt.

347
00:24:25,300 --> 00:24:26,800
Don't even...

348
00:24:30,800 --> 00:24:33,300
She acts like I wrecked the car.

349
00:24:33,400 --> 00:24:35,800
You wrecked the car, didn't you?

350
00:24:37,800 --> 00:24:39,400
Not on purpose.

351
00:24:41,500 --> 00:24:42,800
Now, then.

352
00:24:48,300 --> 00:24:51,700
It seems that the hunter
has become the hunted, huh?

353
00:24:52,200 --> 00:24:55,300
- Excuse me?
- How do you like your freedom now?

354
00:24:56,300 --> 00:24:57,600
My what?

355
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:02,800
Dance, monkey, dance!

356
00:25:22,500 --> 00:25:24,100
What're you doing?

357
00:25:31,500 --> 00:25:33,100
It was a mistake.

358
00:25:33,700 --> 00:25:36,200
You frightened the life out of me.

359
00:25:36,700 --> 00:25:38,800
Well, it won't happen again.

360
00:26:00,000 --> 00:26:01,400
Whoa, there. Hey, you got me?

361
00:26:13,100 --> 00:26:14,200
Yes!

362
00:26:14,800 --> 00:26:16,400
Yes, I've got you.

363
00:26:16,700 --> 00:26:18,800
As long as you got my back.

364
00:26:32,400 --> 00:26:33,800
Hello, Patrick speaking.

365
00:26:33,900 --> 00:26:35,300
<i>Can you run to my room and see</i>

366
00:26:35,300 --> 00:26:37,800
<i>if there's a birdless tofu turkey coupon
in there?</i>

367
00:26:37,800 --> 00:26:40,100
<i>- What?
- It should be in my pink purse.</i>

368
00:26:40,100 --> 00:26:43,100
No, no, I am holding the ladder right now.
It is a safety issue.

369
00:26:43,200 --> 00:26:44,400
<i>Just do it.</i>

370
00:26:44,500 --> 00:26:47,100
<i>- Look, I'm trying to tell you that...
- You could have done it in this time.</i>

371
00:26:47,200 --> 00:26:49,500
<i>- No, but...
- You could. I timed it.</i>

372
00:26:49,500 --> 00:26:50,600
You did not.

373
00:26:50,700 --> 00:26:52,600
<i>Just put the phone down
and get my purse.</i>

374
00:26:52,700 --> 00:26:54,600
<i>How hard can that be?</i>

375
00:26:54,600 --> 00:26:56,500
All right, hold please.

376
00:26:57,700 --> 00:27:01,200
No, I'm telling you, it's not in here.
I've looked, like, five times.

377
00:27:01,200 --> 00:27:04,200
<i>Oh, you're right. It's not.
I've got it right here.</i>

378
00:27:04,300 --> 00:27:05,700
<i>- We done?
- Done.</i>

379
00:27:44,100 --> 00:27:45,200
Ryan?

380
00:27:54,400 --> 00:27:55,800
Did you fall?

381
00:27:57,500 --> 00:28:01,000
I'm only asking because
it looks like you may have fallen.

382
00:28:01,100 --> 00:28:02,700
Looks like you might have had
a falling accident.

383
00:28:02,700 --> 00:28:05,000
Something undesired
and unforeseen happened,

384
00:28:05,100 --> 00:28:08,200
and couldn't be avoided,
and you fell.

385
00:28:09,700 --> 00:28:11,100
On your own.

386
00:28:11,700 --> 00:28:13,400
Wouldn't you say?

387
00:28:17,600 --> 00:28:18,700
Well.

388
00:28:20,200 --> 00:28:22,900
At least the bush broke your fall, huh?

389
00:28:29,600 --> 00:28:30,800
Or not.

390
00:28:40,300 --> 00:28:41,600
He's dead.

391
00:28:42,100 --> 00:28:43,800
What have you done?

392
00:28:45,900 --> 00:28:48,000
You haven't even started.

393
00:28:51,100 --> 00:28:52,400
I'm dead.

394
00:28:57,800 --> 00:28:59,700
Just taking a breather.

395
00:29:00,100 --> 00:29:01,500
Where's Ryan?

396
00:29:02,400 --> 00:29:05,000
- He's bushed.
- Yeah, but where is he?

397
00:29:06,100 --> 00:29:07,600
- Gone.
- Gone?

398
00:29:08,300 --> 00:29:10,500
Could you, maybe,
elaborate on that for me?

399
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:13,000
For a jog.

400
00:29:13,100 --> 00:29:14,600
- A jog?
- A jog. Yes.

401
00:29:14,700 --> 00:29:17,400
Yes, I'm thinking about doing the same.

402
00:29:21,400 --> 00:29:22,700
Whatever.

403
00:29:45,200 --> 00:29:46,200
Patrick.

404
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:50,300
Patrick.

405
00:30:04,900 --> 00:30:06,200
Patrick?

406
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,300
- Hey!
- Hi.

407
00:30:13,400 --> 00:30:15,800
- Hey.
- This is for you.

408
00:30:18,500 --> 00:30:21,200
- What is it?
- Well, open it and see.

409
00:30:33,200 --> 00:30:34,500
Wow.

410
00:30:40,200 --> 00:30:41,300
Thank you.

411
00:30:41,400 --> 00:30:43,300
Oh, it's not from me.

412
00:30:43,400 --> 00:30:45,200
- Huh?
- It's from Ryan.

413
00:30:50,000 --> 00:30:52,400
- Right.
- It was his idea.

414
00:30:52,500 --> 00:30:54,600
- Nice.
- He seems to like you.

415
00:30:55,600 --> 00:30:57,200
Well, I'm very likeable.

416
00:31:00,000 --> 00:31:01,100
Ryan?

417
00:31:03,000 --> 00:31:04,600
Ryan, you okay?

418
00:31:08,400 --> 00:31:10,200
Feel a little better?

419
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:12,900
A little less dead maybe?

420
00:31:21,500 --> 00:31:23,100
Your show's on.

421
00:31:35,300 --> 00:31:36,500
Mars!

422
00:31:37,600 --> 00:31:38,900
Mars!

423
00:31:39,000 --> 00:31:41,800
Bad dog! Look, sit. Come. Heel, no, just...

424
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,600
Don't... Just leave the dead alone!

425
00:31:43,700 --> 00:31:46,600
You are so getting a time-out here, mister.

426
00:31:48,400 --> 00:31:50,000
What's he doing?

427
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,600
Nothing. I was just...

428
00:31:55,200 --> 00:31:58,900
- I was just teaching him how to play.
- Oh.

429
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,400
- Play what?
- Play dead.

430
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:08,000
Which ex-girlfriend?

431
00:32:09,400 --> 00:32:12,900
Jan... Jane E...

432
00:32:13,000 --> 00:32:14,700
- Janie?
- Janie.

433
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:16,000
He's never dated a Janie.

434
00:32:16,100 --> 00:32:20,100
Oh, well, maybe if you go through the list,
one of them would ring a bell.

435
00:32:21,100 --> 00:32:22,500
- Gretchen?
- That's the one.

436
00:32:22,600 --> 00:32:24,700
Gretchen moved to Thailand.

437
00:32:25,400 --> 00:32:27,300
Oh, I guess that's where he's gone.

438
00:32:27,400 --> 00:32:30,000
He thought he'd look her up,
so he went to Thailand?

439
00:32:30,000 --> 00:32:33,300
- Well, you know how it is with exes.
- Yes, I do.

440
00:32:38,500 --> 00:32:39,900
- What are you doing?
- I'm calling Gretchen.

441
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,000
- In Thailand?
- I wanna know what's going on.

442
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:45,200
- Yeah, well, it's probably long distance.
- I'm aware of that.

443
00:32:45,300 --> 00:32:46,300
You have her number?

444
00:32:46,400 --> 00:32:49,000
Gretchen works at the embassy.
It shouldn't be too hard to track her down.

445
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:50,700
Gretchen. Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

446
00:32:50,800 --> 00:32:52,700
You know, it wasn't Gretchen.
It was someone else.

447
00:32:52,800 --> 00:32:53,800
Who?

448
00:32:53,900 --> 00:32:56,600
If only I could remember, then you'd
be able to follow up with a phone call,

449
00:32:56,700 --> 00:32:57,800
or a visit, or something.

450
00:32:57,800 --> 00:32:58,900
That would be nice.

451
00:32:59,000 --> 00:33:02,900
I am at the mercy of my own
failing memory and I feel so powerless.

452
00:33:02,900 --> 00:33:04,000
Chicken?

453
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,100
<i>Are you mad? I would rather die.</i>

454
00:33:07,200 --> 00:33:10,100
<i>Better death's dark dominion
than life at your side.</i>

455
00:33:10,100 --> 00:33:12,000
<i>Well, what about your dear Colt?</i>

456
00:33:12,000 --> 00:33:13,700
<i>I've harnessed the darkness of the void.</i>

457
00:33:13,800 --> 00:33:15,500
<i>A wrinkle in the time-space vortex</i>

458
00:33:15,600 --> 00:33:18,600
<i>will turn a second of pain
into an eternity of torture.</i>

459
00:33:18,700 --> 00:33:22,300
<i>Hell, if that's the case,
make mine a double.</i>

460
00:33:23,800 --> 00:33:26,700
<i>He's hit the plasma antimatter
containment coil.</i>

461
00:33:26,700 --> 00:33:29,000
- Want some help?
- No, I'm all right.

462
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,600
Carry on.

463
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:35,100
- Sure you don't need a hand?
- No, no. No hands.

464
00:33:37,700 --> 00:33:41,200
- How about now?
- No, no. Now I'm good.

465
00:33:51,600 --> 00:33:54,500
- Appreciate the offer, thanks.
- You're welcome.

466
00:34:07,600 --> 00:34:11,300
<i>Trickery and deceit.
He can't think he'll get away with this.</i>

467
00:34:11,300 --> 00:34:14,600
<i>Chin up, my beauty. We'll be sipping
Thermicilonian thunder water...</i>

468
00:34:17,400 --> 00:34:20,300
- About time to pack it in, don't you think?
- It's 7:00.

469
00:34:20,400 --> 00:34:21,600
- So that's a "no"?
- Yep.

470
00:34:21,700 --> 00:34:24,200
Sorry. Yes it's a no, or yes it's a yes,
you're gonna pack it in?

471
00:34:24,300 --> 00:34:25,900
I'm gonna wait up for Ryan.

472
00:34:25,900 --> 00:34:28,300
- And what if...
- What if what?

473
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:29,500
- He's late.
- I'll wait.

474
00:34:29,600 --> 00:34:31,300
- Very late?
- Don't mind.

475
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:32,600
Never?

476
00:34:33,200 --> 00:34:34,900
- What?
- Never mind.

477
00:34:40,200 --> 00:34:43,800
<i>- I'm buying.
- Baby, I'm already sold.</i>

478
00:34:52,100 --> 00:34:54,900
The joy knowing that I'm related to that.

479
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:56,800
Super.

480
00:35:24,400 --> 00:35:26,000
Oh, what the...

481
00:35:27,400 --> 00:35:29,700
What? I measured and everything.

482
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:36,800
No! Oh, inches!

483
00:35:37,500 --> 00:35:39,800
<i>Idiot! Don't you see what you've done?</i>

484
00:36:05,700 --> 00:36:07,000
Thirsty?

485
00:36:07,700 --> 00:36:09,100
No, just...

486
00:36:11,000 --> 00:36:12,300
Just having a nightcap.

487
00:36:12,400 --> 00:36:15,200
- You're covered in mud.
- Yes. Oh, yeah.

488
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,600
What are you doing out there?

489
00:36:20,300 --> 00:36:21,700
Gardening.

490
00:36:22,000 --> 00:36:23,400
At midnight?

491
00:36:23,900 --> 00:36:26,500
Well, it's the best time for...

492
00:36:27,000 --> 00:36:28,600
For planting.

493
00:36:28,600 --> 00:36:30,500
How does that work?

494
00:36:30,600 --> 00:36:32,200
Because of the plants.

495
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,100
They're all asleep.

496
00:36:34,100 --> 00:36:38,300
So, for them the move is just a bad dream,
and they wake up in a new, happy place.

497
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:39,500
What do you have to plant?

498
00:36:39,600 --> 00:36:43,200
I mean, what's so important
that you have to plant it now?

499
00:36:49,400 --> 00:36:51,400
- This little guy right here.
- Oh.

500
00:36:51,500 --> 00:36:54,300
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Just in time, too, by the looks of it.

501
00:36:54,300 --> 00:36:55,600
Patrick.

502
00:36:56,200 --> 00:36:57,300
Hmm?

503
00:36:57,300 --> 00:36:58,500
I really don't care.

504
00:36:58,600 --> 00:37:00,400
Well, someone has to.

505
00:37:01,100 --> 00:37:04,400
Is there anything else
you want to talk to me about?

506
00:37:05,800 --> 00:37:10,000
No, no, no,
I think I've covered it all pretty well.

507
00:37:10,000 --> 00:37:11,400
Maybe Ryan?

508
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:13,000
Hmm?

509
00:37:13,100 --> 00:37:14,200
Patrick.

510
00:37:14,300 --> 00:37:16,200
Oh, is he the guy with the...

511
00:37:16,300 --> 00:37:18,400
Like maybe where he went?

512
00:37:18,500 --> 00:37:20,600
What you may have said or done
to make him go?

513
00:37:20,700 --> 00:37:22,600
Me? Nothing. No.

514
00:37:23,800 --> 00:37:25,700
- Why?
- Oh, no reason.

515
00:37:25,800 --> 00:37:26,900
I thought it might be nice to know

516
00:37:27,000 --> 00:37:28,500
where my fiancé
has suddenly disappeared to,

517
00:37:28,600 --> 00:37:29,900
but don't let it bother you.

518
00:37:29,900 --> 00:37:32,800
Feel free to return
to your important botanical work.

519
00:37:32,900 --> 00:37:34,200
Yeah, well...

520
00:37:35,100 --> 00:37:36,700
I really should.

521
00:37:58,700 --> 00:37:59,800
Hello?

522
00:40:05,800 --> 00:40:07,900
What are you screaming about?

523
00:40:42,000 --> 00:40:43,100
Mars.

524
00:40:44,700 --> 00:40:45,900
Brekky.

525
00:40:50,400 --> 00:40:52,200
What have we got here?

526
00:40:57,300 --> 00:40:58,400
Wow.

527
00:40:59,100 --> 00:41:01,300
That's a prize inside.

528
00:41:07,000 --> 00:41:11,500
"From Mookie to Pepe.
Together forever till death do us part."

529
00:41:16,800 --> 00:41:18,200
Ryan's watch.

530
00:41:19,300 --> 00:41:22,000
What's Ryan's watch
doing in my Frootees?

531
00:41:44,300 --> 00:41:45,300
Ryan!

532
00:41:57,400 --> 00:41:58,500
What are you doing?

533
00:41:58,500 --> 00:41:59,800
I'm bored. I thought I'd get these lights up.

534
00:41:59,900 --> 00:42:01,500
Oh, good thinking.

535
00:42:01,500 --> 00:42:03,200
Were you calling for Ryan?

536
00:42:03,300 --> 00:42:05,600
No. No, no. He was just...

537
00:42:06,300 --> 00:42:08,500
He was doing the exact same thing
the other day.

538
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:10,700
- I know. He's so sweet.
- Oh, yes. How sweet.

539
00:42:10,700 --> 00:42:12,000
You know, just stir up those spiders.

540
00:42:12,100 --> 00:42:13,200
Get them up and scuttling about

541
00:42:13,300 --> 00:42:16,200
instead of safe and trackable in their lairs.

542
00:42:16,300 --> 00:42:19,000
Aren't you a little curious
about where he's got to?

543
00:42:19,100 --> 00:42:20,500
Very.

544
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:23,400
But it's better this way.

545
00:42:23,400 --> 00:42:26,200
- What way?
- This him-not-being-here way.

546
00:42:26,200 --> 00:42:27,300
Trust me.

547
00:42:27,300 --> 00:42:28,900
What does that mean?

548
00:42:29,000 --> 00:42:31,100
- Look, I know things.
- No, no, you don't.

549
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:32,300
- Yes, I do.
- No, you don't.

550
00:42:32,300 --> 00:42:33,700
He was gonna kill you. You know that?

551
00:42:33,700 --> 00:42:35,100
- What?
- Yes, indeed.

552
00:42:35,200 --> 00:42:36,800
You didn't know him so well now, did you?

553
00:42:36,900 --> 00:42:39,600
- He isn't gonna kill me.
- Not anymore, he's not.

554
00:42:39,700 --> 00:42:41,800
Why would he want to kill me?

555
00:42:41,900 --> 00:42:45,100
For his freedom. So he could feel her heat.

556
00:42:46,200 --> 00:42:47,900
What heat? Who's her?

557
00:42:48,000 --> 00:42:50,400
Probably Gretchen. Look,
I heard him on the phone. He was all,

558
00:42:50,500 --> 00:42:53,400
"Oh, you know, baby.
I need the heat that I get from you."

559
00:42:53,400 --> 00:42:56,300
"Until she's gone, we'll never be together."

560
00:42:58,400 --> 00:42:59,500
What?

561
00:42:59,600 --> 00:43:01,100
"With her out of the way,
we've got the world,

562
00:43:01,200 --> 00:43:03,600
"the power to be who we wanna be."

563
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,200
- Might have been something like that.
- It was exactly that, wasn't it?

564
00:43:08,200 --> 00:43:09,500
Maybe a little.

565
00:43:09,500 --> 00:43:12,000
He was running lines from the show.

566
00:43:13,300 --> 00:43:15,000
On his cell phone? I don't think so.

567
00:43:15,000 --> 00:43:18,000
<i>He was quoting StarCrossed
in an interview.</i>

568
00:43:18,800 --> 00:43:20,300
- No.
- Yes.

569
00:43:20,300 --> 00:43:23,300
What? You thought he was gonna kill me?

570
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:26,100
- No, I'm not an idiot.
- Yeah, you are.

571
00:43:26,200 --> 00:43:29,000
- Well, you'll get over him.
- He's coming back.

572
00:43:29,000 --> 00:43:31,500
- I really hope not.
- Well, I hope so.

573
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:34,500
- You'll be fine. You'll meet someone else.
- I don't want anyone else.

574
00:43:34,500 --> 00:43:37,000
I'll introduce you to one of my friends.

575
00:43:37,100 --> 00:43:40,600
- You don't have any friends, Patrick.
- Oh, I have friends.

576
00:43:41,500 --> 00:43:42,700
- I could.
- No, you couldn't.

577
00:43:43,900 --> 00:43:45,100
You have to be a normal person
to have friends.

578
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:46,700
You have to leave the house.

579
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:49,400
- See? Not necessarily.
- Call off the dog.

580
00:43:50,000 --> 00:43:51,200
Somebody?

581
00:43:55,600 --> 00:43:57,000
Patrick, this is really nice of you.

582
00:44:01,400 --> 00:44:04,000
- You gonna wear that?
- Why wouldn't I?

583
00:44:04,100 --> 00:44:06,300
I just thought you might
want to wear something pretty.

584
00:44:06,300 --> 00:44:08,200
- Thanks.
- Suit yourself.

585
00:44:08,200 --> 00:44:11,200
- Can we eat?
- Actually, no.

586
00:44:11,200 --> 00:44:13,200
Let's wait a minute.

587
00:44:13,200 --> 00:44:14,400
I'm not hungry yet.

588
00:44:15,600 --> 00:44:17,200
Okay, dinner.

589
00:44:17,200 --> 00:44:20,100
- Aren't you gonna get that?
- Aren't you?

590
00:44:20,200 --> 00:44:22,300
- You're right there.
- I think you should get it.

591
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:24,400
I think you were adopted.

592
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:43,000
Lovely Lumps,
your search for a soul mate is at an end.

593
00:44:44,300 --> 00:44:46,000
I beg your pardon?

594
00:44:47,200 --> 00:44:49,700
Hey. You must be Lovely Lumps.

595
00:44:51,300 --> 00:44:53,800
Sorry. Not ringing any bells.

596
00:44:54,400 --> 00:44:56,000
Date me please. Org.

597
00:44:56,700 --> 00:44:59,400
I think you've got the wrong address.

598
00:45:00,800 --> 00:45:02,000
Really?

599
00:45:02,500 --> 00:45:03,700
No!

600
00:45:07,100 --> 00:45:08,500
Look, I'm sorry.

601
00:45:08,600 --> 00:45:12,500
I've just been stood up like this
the last five times.

602
00:45:12,600 --> 00:45:14,900
Oh, well. Chin up.

603
00:45:16,800 --> 00:45:19,400
- I see you found us all right.
- Wrong address.

604
00:45:19,500 --> 00:45:21,900
Is it Quietly Sensitive All Male?

605
00:45:24,900 --> 00:45:26,000
Yeah.

606
00:45:26,000 --> 00:45:27,800
At date me please. Org?

607
00:45:28,600 --> 00:45:32,100
Oh, hey. No, I...

608
00:45:32,200 --> 00:45:36,700
I'm not into guys. I mean, it's fine.
I mean, if it weren't me.

609
00:45:38,300 --> 00:45:40,200
But it's fine, though.

610
00:45:42,400 --> 00:45:45,200
- Oh, this is...
- Chris.

611
00:45:45,300 --> 00:45:47,600
Chris, my quietly sensitive, all-male friend.

612
00:45:47,600 --> 00:45:50,000
- Oh, yeah?
- Met on the Internet.

613
00:45:50,100 --> 00:45:51,900
Never left the house.

614
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:09,800
Are you gonna join us?

615
00:46:09,900 --> 00:46:11,800
My name is Patrick.
I'll be your waiter for this evening.

616
00:46:11,900 --> 00:46:13,500
Please, pretend I'm not here.

617
00:46:13,600 --> 00:46:14,900
So, why am I here?

618
00:46:15,000 --> 00:46:16,700
I have no idea
why he's dragged you out here.

619
00:46:16,800 --> 00:46:18,200
I have a great fiancé,

620
00:46:18,300 --> 00:46:20,600
and I'm very happy
with the direction my life is taking.

621
00:46:20,600 --> 00:46:23,400
If veering wildly out of control
counts as a direction.

622
00:46:23,500 --> 00:46:26,000
So you're saying he's the one
who's unhappy and directionless?

623
00:46:26,100 --> 00:46:28,900
Mom and Dad have been gone
for 10 years, and he's still living at home.

624
00:46:29,000 --> 00:46:30,100
That is sad.

625
00:46:30,200 --> 00:46:33,000
Ten-and-a-quarter for those of us who
still care about the people who raised us

626
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,700
and fed us and gave us
a roof over our heads

627
00:46:34,800 --> 00:46:37,900
and the tuition to the grueling curriculum
of beauty school.

628
00:46:37,900 --> 00:46:41,200
It is the most highly regarded school
of makeup artistry in the world,

629
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,100
and it's what I wanted.

630
00:46:43,200 --> 00:46:46,000
- At least I have a job.
- Oh, and I don't.

631
00:46:46,100 --> 00:46:48,400
So, what do you do?

632
00:46:48,400 --> 00:46:49,700
Not here, remember?

633
00:46:49,700 --> 00:46:51,400
And what is wrong
with being a makeup artist?

634
00:46:51,500 --> 00:46:53,200
- Nothing.
- Nothing except everything.

635
00:46:53,300 --> 00:46:55,200
Everything she could have been.
She was as smart as Mom.

636
00:46:55,200 --> 00:46:56,400
She could have been a doctor.

637
00:46:56,500 --> 00:46:58,800
She could have cured them.

638
00:46:58,900 --> 00:47:00,000
Of car accidents?

639
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:03,500
She could have gone into brain surgeonry
or nuclear physicism or astronaut hood.

640
00:47:03,600 --> 00:47:06,400
She could have married a prince
or the dictator of a small country.

641
00:47:06,400 --> 00:47:07,600
She could have had her own stamp.

642
00:47:07,600 --> 00:47:10,300
But this is what I wanted.
You're the one who wants the stamp.

643
00:47:10,400 --> 00:47:12,400
Oh, and I would make
such a great princess.

644
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:13,800
Can we not start all this again?

645
00:47:13,900 --> 00:47:17,400
- You know, she had it all.
- Here we go with the head.

646
00:47:17,500 --> 00:47:19,500
- I got dropped on my head.
- You jumped off the roof.

647
00:47:19,500 --> 00:47:21,400
It was an accident. I fell.

648
00:47:21,500 --> 00:47:23,800
- In a cape and a mask?
- The damage was done.

649
00:47:23,900 --> 00:47:25,200
You were 27.

650
00:47:25,300 --> 00:47:26,700
Wait, hold on.

651
00:47:26,700 --> 00:47:28,800
When you jumped off the roof,
you were 27?

652
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:30,000
Fell.

653
00:47:30,100 --> 00:47:32,700
- In a cape and a mask?
- And tights. Yes.

654
00:47:34,600 --> 00:47:37,800
Look, obviously you guys
have some stuff to work through.

655
00:47:37,900 --> 00:47:39,300
I love Ryan.

656
00:47:39,300 --> 00:47:42,200
- Hey, you loved Mom and Dad.
- It's not an either / or thing.

657
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:44,800
I know that. How do you know it's not?

658
00:47:46,500 --> 00:47:49,800
- Is there any more of the sauce?
- What, you don't have legs?

659
00:47:56,300 --> 00:47:59,700
I'll check with the chef,
but I can't make any promises.

660
00:48:02,300 --> 00:48:03,800
I'm really sorry about this, Chris.

661
00:48:03,800 --> 00:48:06,200
My brother was trying to meddle,
and you got dragged into it.

662
00:48:06,200 --> 00:48:08,200
It was a bit weird, all back and forth,

663
00:48:08,300 --> 00:48:12,900
knowing that I was e-mailing
his lovely lumps rather than yours.

664
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:16,300
We shared a lot.
It'll always be special times to me.

665
00:48:16,400 --> 00:48:18,900
- Yeah.
- Precious moments.

666
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:21,300
Again, sorry for the confusion.

667
00:48:21,800 --> 00:48:23,000
Congratulations on the wedding.

668
00:48:23,100 --> 00:48:25,800
Oh, I don't think Marilyn
will be marrying Ryan any time soon.

669
00:48:25,900 --> 00:48:26,900
No, no, I will.

670
00:48:27,000 --> 00:48:29,500
Yes, but now
that you've met my friend Chris,

671
00:48:29,600 --> 00:48:31,100
you're probably feeling a little conflicted.

672
00:48:31,200 --> 00:48:32,400
Nope.

673
00:48:32,900 --> 00:48:34,700
Well, you know,
don't make any rash decisions.

674
00:48:34,800 --> 00:48:37,600
You know, think about it. Think it through.
Make sure you're certain.

675
00:48:37,700 --> 00:48:39,300
I'm certain.

676
00:48:39,400 --> 00:48:42,300
- No offense, Chris.
- Well, story of my life.

677
00:48:43,100 --> 00:48:45,600
Anyway, I should mosey.

678
00:48:46,800 --> 00:48:49,700
- Great food, Patrick.
- Marilyn's made better.

679
00:48:52,200 --> 00:48:54,000
Thank you for dinner.

680
00:48:55,100 --> 00:48:56,400
Call me.

681
00:49:28,900 --> 00:49:30,000
Mars?

682
00:49:36,400 --> 00:49:37,500
Mars?

683
00:51:01,500 --> 00:51:04,000
Okay. I'm off to the police station.

684
00:51:05,200 --> 00:51:07,900
You're right. It's a great idea. Thanks.

685
00:51:07,900 --> 00:51:10,400
Wait, a police station? A police station
with actual policemen in it?

686
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:13,000
He's been gone for almost 72 hours.

687
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:16,200
Let's at least give him the full 80.

688
00:51:16,300 --> 00:51:17,800
I'm gonna file a Missing Persons Report.

689
00:51:17,900 --> 00:51:20,700
- But he's not missing.
- Where is he?

690
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:22,300
- I don't know.
- Missing.

691
00:51:22,400 --> 00:51:23,800
Yeah, but just because
we don't know where he is,

692
00:51:23,900 --> 00:51:25,800
doesn't mean that
he's missing-persons missing, per se.

693
00:51:25,900 --> 00:51:28,900
- We have to talk to someone.
- I am through with therapy.

694
00:51:29,000 --> 00:51:30,000
You know, Ryan's aunt is a detective.

695
00:51:30,100 --> 00:51:31,600
Maybe she could give me some advice.

696
00:51:31,600 --> 00:51:34,100
You want advice? I'm your man.
What do you need to know?

697
00:51:34,100 --> 00:51:37,400
What a law enforcement officer thinks
I should do about my missing fiancé.

698
00:51:37,500 --> 00:51:38,700
Yeah, well, I can't help you there.

699
00:51:38,800 --> 00:51:42,300
- Police station then?
- But today we were gonna do something.

700
00:51:42,400 --> 00:51:44,500
- Like what?
- Like talk.

701
00:51:45,900 --> 00:51:47,300
About Ryan.

702
00:51:48,600 --> 00:51:50,100
Share stories, sing songs.

703
00:51:50,200 --> 00:51:51,600
Are you trying to torture me?

704
00:51:51,700 --> 00:51:55,000
No, if I was trying to torture you,
you'd know you were being tortured.

705
00:51:55,000 --> 00:51:56,800
Maybe this is karma.

706
00:51:56,900 --> 00:51:59,100
Karma? What have I ever done?

707
00:51:59,900 --> 00:52:03,100
- Well, you told Dad I was gay.
- Yeah, you were.

708
00:52:03,200 --> 00:52:04,200
- No, I wasn't.
- Yes, you were.

709
00:52:04,300 --> 00:52:05,700
You had that boyfriend... What's his name?

710
00:52:05,700 --> 00:52:07,200
- I never had a boyfriend!
- Yes, you did.

711
00:52:07,200 --> 00:52:09,900
The weird little guy in the dress.

712
00:52:10,000 --> 00:52:11,200
Amy.

713
00:52:12,000 --> 00:52:13,100
That was a girl?

714
00:52:13,100 --> 00:52:16,400
Yeah, well,
Amy could've been the giveaway.

715
00:52:16,500 --> 00:52:19,400
- Well, got to go.
- Yeah, but the police?

716
00:52:19,500 --> 00:52:22,500
I know you don't care, but I love that man.

717
00:52:22,600 --> 00:52:24,600
- He was all right.
- What?

718
00:52:27,000 --> 00:52:30,200
- He was kind of nice.
- Wow, that's a turnaround.

719
00:52:30,200 --> 00:52:32,900
It's too bad you drove him away.

720
00:52:32,900 --> 00:52:34,900
I really hate you.

721
00:52:36,100 --> 00:52:38,000
See, you say that, but...

722
00:52:47,400 --> 00:52:50,200
<i>Patrick.</i>

723
00:52:55,400 --> 00:52:56,400
Mars?

724
00:53:05,500 --> 00:53:10,600
<i>Patrick.</i>

725
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,400
Huh! Huh.

726
00:53:28,100 --> 00:53:29,400
Ow!

727
00:53:29,500 --> 00:53:31,200
Stupid tea!

728
00:53:31,200 --> 00:53:34,300
<i>Murder.</i>

729
00:53:41,500 --> 00:53:45,800
<i>Murderer.</i>

730
00:54:52,600 --> 00:54:54,100
This is crazy.

731
00:54:54,800 --> 00:54:56,300
I'm going nuts.

732
00:54:56,900 --> 00:54:58,300
This can't be happening.

733
00:54:58,300 --> 00:55:00,000
How can that happen?

734
00:55:00,100 --> 00:55:01,300
It can't.

735
00:55:02,300 --> 00:55:04,000
I'm imagining it.

736
00:55:05,400 --> 00:55:06,800
Still there.

737
00:55:09,700 --> 00:55:11,000
Mmm-hmm.

738
00:55:11,100 --> 00:55:12,900
Definitely still there.

739
00:55:13,000 --> 00:55:14,100
So.

740
00:55:15,600 --> 00:55:18,000
That's not going anywhere.
What do you do now?

741
00:55:18,100 --> 00:55:20,400
What do you do when the actor you buried

742
00:55:20,500 --> 00:55:24,900
unburies himself and ends up
on your back porch for everyone to see?

743
00:55:24,900 --> 00:55:26,700
For everyone to see.

744
00:55:28,100 --> 00:55:30,600
They could be seeing him right now.

745
00:55:40,300 --> 00:55:41,500
Oh, yeah.

746
00:55:42,100 --> 00:55:44,400
That's great
that that got here.

747
00:55:46,600 --> 00:55:48,700
That's just what I wanted.

748
00:56:50,300 --> 00:56:51,400
What's up?

749
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:19,100
What is that? That's marshmallows.

750
00:57:19,200 --> 00:57:21,000
But they're for me.

751
00:57:22,700 --> 00:57:23,700
Oops.

752
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:25,400
There we go.

753
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:36,300
Okay, so that's not Mars.

754
00:58:32,000 --> 00:58:34,300
Why won't you leave me alone?

755
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:37,800
Why won't you just stay dead?

756
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:48,100
No!

757
00:58:49,500 --> 00:58:50,600
No!

758
00:58:50,600 --> 00:58:52,500
Get away from me!

759
00:58:52,600 --> 00:58:55,400
I'm sorry I killed you,
but please don't kill me!

760
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:56,900
It's a fish.

761
00:58:58,500 --> 00:58:59,600
What?

762
00:59:02,500 --> 00:59:04,400
- Oh, I know that.
- You didn't kill him.

763
00:59:05,400 --> 00:59:07,500
Oh, it was all just a dream.

764
00:59:08,200 --> 00:59:10,200
All just a horrible dream.

765
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:13,700
He's not dead.

766
00:59:14,900 --> 00:59:19,100
Well, I mean, he looks pretty dead now,
but I wouldn't blame yourself.

767
00:59:19,100 --> 00:59:20,400
Not the fish.

768
00:59:20,500 --> 00:59:22,000
The crabs are still very much alive.

769
00:59:25,100 --> 00:59:26,800
- Ryan.
- What about him?

770
00:59:26,800 --> 00:59:30,000
- He's not dead.
- Why would he be dead?

771
00:59:30,000 --> 00:59:32,000
He wouldn't be.

772
00:59:33,200 --> 00:59:35,500
Why would you say that?

773
00:59:35,600 --> 00:59:38,100
- So, where did they come from?
- I picked them up on the way home.

774
00:59:38,200 --> 00:59:41,400
You brought these creatures
into our house?

775
00:59:41,400 --> 00:59:42,800
I thought you were a vegetarian.

776
00:59:42,900 --> 00:59:45,200
- Ovo-lacto-pesco.
- Bless you.

777
00:59:45,200 --> 00:59:48,000
- Every time.
- So, not a dream.

778
00:59:48,100 --> 00:59:50,100
I think I'm down a crab.

779
01:00:04,600 --> 01:00:06,600
You done with the hammer?

780
01:00:07,700 --> 01:00:09,700
- Why, you want it?
- No. No.

781
01:00:12,100 --> 01:00:15,300
I just need you to shut up
so I can get some sleep.

782
01:00:15,300 --> 01:00:19,200
I'm thinking some of the nail placements
might need rethinking.

783
01:00:21,400 --> 01:00:24,500
I can think of a few places
I'd like you to place them.

784
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:28,100
Ryan's aunt is coming by early tomorrow
so I need you to keep it down.

785
01:00:28,100 --> 01:00:30,100
Tomorrow? No, no, no,
tomorrow's not good for me.

786
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:33,600
- Why not?
- She's a detective.

787
01:00:33,600 --> 01:00:35,400
Yeah, that's why I called her.

788
01:00:35,500 --> 01:00:38,100
What if she finds we're inadvertently
breaking some obscure law?

789
01:00:38,200 --> 01:00:40,300
No, she won't,
but she may help us find Ryan.

790
01:00:40,400 --> 01:00:44,200
Ignorance is not a defense
when it comes to the fine print.

791
01:00:48,000 --> 01:00:49,800
Do you remember
when you used to actually help me

792
01:00:49,800 --> 01:00:52,600
as opposed to making my life misery?

793
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:54,100
Can't say I do.

794
01:00:54,200 --> 01:00:57,500
- The bully kid at school?
- Which one? There were a lot of them.

795
01:00:57,600 --> 01:01:00,300
You insisted on walking me home
every day, remember?

796
01:01:00,300 --> 01:01:01,700
Yeah, I hated that.

797
01:01:01,700 --> 01:01:03,600
Well, only because
you got beaten up every time.

798
01:01:03,700 --> 01:01:06,500
- That was a rough school.
- Tiny Tots Day Care.

799
01:01:06,500 --> 01:01:08,200
They worked in packs,
one of them had teeth.

800
01:01:08,300 --> 01:01:09,600
But you showed up every day.

801
01:01:09,700 --> 01:01:12,200
Yeah, well, Mom and Dad
asked me to keep an eye on you.

802
01:01:12,300 --> 01:01:13,900
No, they didn't.

803
01:01:14,000 --> 01:01:17,100
- I was going that way anyway.
- No, you weren't.

804
01:01:17,700 --> 01:01:20,200
Look, you're my brother, and I love you.

805
01:01:20,300 --> 01:01:21,700
Sometimes.

806
01:01:21,700 --> 01:01:25,400
But Ryan is never gonna replace you,
or Mom and Dad.

807
01:01:25,400 --> 01:01:26,500
Okay?

808
01:01:35,300 --> 01:01:37,100
Not anymore, he's not.

809
01:01:37,200 --> 01:01:39,000
What are you saying?

810
01:01:41,700 --> 01:01:44,900
Not any more than anyone else ever could,
he's not.

811
01:01:55,000 --> 01:01:56,600
Hello?

812
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:58,100
I'll get it.

813
01:02:03,300 --> 01:02:05,600
- Who is it?
- He's just in the bath.

814
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:08,300
Can I get you something,
a cup of tea maybe?

815
01:02:08,300 --> 01:02:10,900
- Marilyn!
- Patrick, it's Ryan's aunt.

816
01:02:12,600 --> 01:02:15,200
- To see us?
- About Ryan.

817
01:02:15,200 --> 01:02:18,800
- What about Ryan?
- She's a detective, remember?

818
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:21,300
What would I know about Ryan?
I don't know anything about Ryan.

819
01:02:21,300 --> 01:02:22,600
Hurry up.

820
01:02:25,800 --> 01:02:28,000
All right, I'll be right out.

821
01:02:37,200 --> 01:02:38,400
Patrick.

822
01:02:39,700 --> 01:02:40,900
Hello.

823
01:02:42,000 --> 01:02:43,700
Detective Morse.

824
01:02:45,500 --> 01:02:47,100
- Thought you were in the living room.
- I was.

825
01:02:47,100 --> 01:02:50,400
Yes, of course you were.
Everything all right in there?

826
01:02:50,500 --> 01:02:54,000
- Marilyn get you a nice cup of tea?
- That she did. Lovely young lady.

827
01:02:54,100 --> 01:02:56,800
Can I help you with something?

828
01:02:56,900 --> 01:02:59,500
- Ma'am? Officer?
- Detective.

829
01:02:59,600 --> 01:03:03,000
- I need to ask you some questions.
- Well, you know, shoot.

830
01:03:03,100 --> 01:03:05,800
Well, don't shoot but, you know, fire away.

831
01:03:05,900 --> 01:03:08,800
May I ask what it is you're doing out here?

832
01:03:10,300 --> 01:03:12,500
That's the question
you came all the way up here to ask?

833
01:03:12,600 --> 01:03:15,500
Top of my list, yes.

834
01:03:15,500 --> 01:03:19,100
- Well, I was coming to see you.
- Through the window?

835
01:03:19,100 --> 01:03:22,000
Yes. Through the window.

836
01:03:22,100 --> 01:03:24,500
How would that work?

837
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:26,400
As it turns out, not terribly well.

838
01:03:26,500 --> 01:03:27,800
If you were an officer of the law...

839
01:03:27,900 --> 01:03:30,400
Which I should just jump in here right now
and say I am not.

840
01:03:30,500 --> 01:03:32,900
...would this not strike you as suspicious?

841
01:03:33,000 --> 01:03:34,500
Which part?

842
01:03:34,600 --> 01:03:37,600
Finding a naked man climbing
out the rear window of the residence.

843
01:03:37,600 --> 01:03:39,300
Oh, that part.

844
01:03:39,300 --> 01:03:41,100
I guess that would depend
on the circumstances.

845
01:03:41,200 --> 01:03:42,800
How so?

846
01:03:45,100 --> 01:03:47,300
Yes. Yes, it would.

847
01:03:49,600 --> 01:03:51,000
I would normally use the door...

848
01:03:51,000 --> 01:03:54,800
But this morning, the window
seemed more appropriate, did it?

849
01:03:55,500 --> 01:03:57,900
It's a knob malfunction.

850
01:04:00,400 --> 01:04:02,900
Could you grab my towel?

851
01:04:07,100 --> 01:04:09,900
So, you've not seen
or heard from him since?

852
01:04:09,900 --> 01:04:11,600
Not a peep.

853
01:04:11,700 --> 01:04:15,300
But you've been present at the residence
the entire time?

854
01:04:15,400 --> 01:04:17,300
At the house, yes.

855
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:18,700
But you, Marilyn, you've left the premises?

856
01:04:18,800 --> 01:04:19,800
Yes.

857
01:04:19,900 --> 01:04:21,900
May I ask what reason you had
for leaving a crime scene?

858
01:04:22,000 --> 01:04:25,000
I've left a couple of times actually.
I went to get some groceries and...

859
01:04:25,100 --> 01:04:26,300
Can we go back to crime scene?

860
01:04:26,400 --> 01:04:29,100
Her fiancé goes missing
and she decides to go grocery shopping.

861
01:04:29,100 --> 01:04:30,800
I didn't know he was missing at that point.

862
01:04:30,900 --> 01:04:33,300
- But you admit that he's missing now?
- Oh, yes, of course he's missing.

863
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:38,700
And you saw this as an opportunity to pick
up some fresh fruit and veggies, did you?

864
01:04:38,800 --> 01:04:41,500
I don't know
how I'm supposed to answer that.

865
01:04:41,600 --> 01:04:44,500
Were you on good terms
with the missing gentleman?

866
01:04:44,600 --> 01:04:47,500
Ryan, your nephew, yes.
We were engaged to be married.

867
01:04:47,500 --> 01:04:50,300
You know that, you sent us a knife block.

868
01:04:50,300 --> 01:04:52,600
Och, you're welcome, dear.

869
01:04:52,700 --> 01:04:56,700
- Am I to infer from that that you were?
- Good terms. Yes.

870
01:04:56,800 --> 01:04:59,700
Had you and he ever discussed insurance?

871
01:05:00,100 --> 01:05:04,300
I see, so the multi-thousand-dollar
settlement was news to you.

872
01:05:04,400 --> 01:05:06,900
- Multi-thousand?
- That's right.

873
01:05:07,000 --> 01:05:09,800
Well, he was the best thing in the show.

874
01:05:09,900 --> 01:05:11,500
- Excuse me?
- You didn't think so?

875
01:05:11,600 --> 01:05:12,700
Of course I did.

876
01:05:12,800 --> 01:05:15,400
<i>- This is StarCrossed, the space soap?
- Daytime Emmy-nominated.</i>

877
01:05:15,500 --> 01:05:16,600
Not usually my thing.

878
01:05:16,700 --> 01:05:18,300
- It really sucked me in.
- Did it?

879
01:05:18,300 --> 01:05:21,600
- Ryan was very good.
- Yes. Yes, he was.

880
01:05:21,700 --> 01:05:24,200
- I thought you never watched it.
- I watched it a bunch of times.

881
01:05:24,300 --> 01:05:26,800
- You said once by accident.
- I lied.

882
01:05:26,900 --> 01:05:28,000
Not that I lie that often.

883
01:05:29,600 --> 01:05:32,900
- But you watched it and enjoyed it?
- Yes.

884
01:05:32,900 --> 01:05:35,400
Let's cut to the chase, shall we?

885
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:47,300
Sorry?

886
01:05:47,300 --> 01:05:50,600
Well, you stand to make a substantial
amount of money if Ryan doesn't turn up.

887
01:05:50,700 --> 01:05:51,900
- I do?
- She does?

888
01:05:51,900 --> 01:05:53,400
She does.

889
01:05:53,400 --> 01:05:55,600
I think the time for games is over, missy.

890
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,100
- Is it?
- Aye.

891
01:05:57,200 --> 01:05:59,900
This is a serious criminal investigation.

892
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:02,100
When did this become seriously criminal?

893
01:06:02,200 --> 01:06:07,000
When the black widow here lined
her web with the proceeds of a rising star.

894
01:06:07,100 --> 01:06:08,600
You think I murdered him?

895
01:06:08,700 --> 01:06:10,400
You're the one
throwing murder words around.

896
01:06:10,500 --> 01:06:13,800
And by murder words
she means the word "murdered."

897
01:06:13,900 --> 01:06:16,100
I'm going to need to look around.

898
01:06:16,200 --> 01:06:19,100
- Don't you need a warrant for that?
- Well, you could refuse.

899
01:06:19,100 --> 01:06:21,500
- Oh, great.
- But I'd advise against it.

900
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,300
Yeah, but you're the one
doing the looking around,

901
01:06:23,400 --> 01:06:25,100
so you're probably a little biased.

902
01:06:25,200 --> 01:06:26,700
I've got nothing to hide, search away.

903
01:06:26,800 --> 01:06:28,500
Actually, I'd prefer
to have a quick go-around,

904
01:06:28,600 --> 01:06:31,200
maybe with a vacuum cleaner,
just to clean up a little bit.

905
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:34,200
Just in case there are any, you know,
nasty surprises.

906
01:06:34,300 --> 01:06:36,200
And by nasty surprises,
I mean cleanliness issues

907
01:06:36,200 --> 01:06:39,000
rather than criminal-tampering issues.

908
01:06:41,200 --> 01:06:43,500
So, you're consenting to the search?

909
01:06:43,600 --> 01:06:45,300
- I am.
- Actually, a rain check would...

910
01:06:45,400 --> 01:06:46,800
Would be good.

911
01:06:47,900 --> 01:06:49,900
Then, if you'll excuse me,

912
01:06:51,900 --> 01:06:53,200
I'll take a look around.

913
01:06:56,700 --> 01:06:58,700
Herb garden?

914
01:06:58,800 --> 01:07:00,600
Just need the herbs.

915
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,700
So, not an electric ladder?

916
01:07:05,800 --> 01:07:08,000
God! They saw me coming.

917
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,600
No, I don't see it.

918
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:21,400
There, sweetie, that's an arm,

919
01:07:23,400 --> 01:07:25,100
and those are legs.

920
01:07:27,000 --> 01:07:28,900
So, everything in order?

921
01:07:32,100 --> 01:07:34,100
- Oh, yes.
- Great.

922
01:07:34,200 --> 01:07:36,300
- I'll see you downtown.
- No.

923
01:07:36,300 --> 01:07:37,900
You won't get away with this, little lady.

924
01:07:38,000 --> 01:07:39,800
I will be back with a warrant
and a forensics team.

925
01:07:39,900 --> 01:07:41,900
- Forensics?
- Don't go anywhere.

926
01:07:42,000 --> 01:07:44,000
I've got my eye on you.

927
01:07:44,000 --> 01:07:46,400
Yes, well, thanks for coming by.

928
01:07:52,500 --> 01:07:54,400
You, too, sweet cheeks.

929
01:08:00,000 --> 01:08:01,800
Well, she seems nice.

930
01:08:21,900 --> 01:08:24,300
I haven't done anything
so there's nothing to worry about.

931
01:08:24,400 --> 01:08:25,600
You haven't?

932
01:08:25,700 --> 01:08:29,300
Let her bring her DNA scanners,
her fingerprint lifters,

933
01:08:29,400 --> 01:08:31,400
and her snuffer dogs.

934
01:08:32,800 --> 01:08:34,600
What's a snuffer dog?

935
01:08:35,600 --> 01:08:40,300
Sorry, I'm a little hazy about who
and what shows up at police searches.

936
01:08:40,400 --> 01:08:42,000
Well, I could see sniffer dogs.

937
01:08:42,000 --> 01:08:45,400
How could she think I was responsible
for Ryan's disappearance?

938
01:08:45,500 --> 01:08:47,000
I have no idea.

939
01:09:21,500 --> 01:09:23,500
- You killed him?
- Not on purpose.

940
01:09:23,600 --> 01:09:26,000
You killed him by accident while
you were trying to kill him on purpose.

941
01:09:26,100 --> 01:09:27,500
You make it sound like it's my fault.

942
01:09:27,600 --> 01:09:30,100
- How do you live with yourself?
- I thought he was trying to kill you.

943
01:09:30,100 --> 01:09:32,600
<i>He was quoting StarCrossed
in an interview.</i>

944
01:09:32,700 --> 01:09:35,400
- I thought maybe I didn't like him.
- So you killed him?

945
01:09:35,500 --> 01:09:38,100
You think that's a normal response
to maybe not liking someone?

946
01:09:38,200 --> 01:09:40,900
Gee, I hope Patrick
maybe likes this one or it's...

947
01:09:41,000 --> 01:09:42,600
It was not like that,

948
01:09:42,700 --> 01:09:45,100
if that was supposed to be
the throat-cutting sound.

949
01:09:45,200 --> 01:09:47,300
- What is he doing in your bed?
- I didn't put him there.

950
01:09:47,400 --> 01:09:49,100
Well, he's there now.

951
01:09:49,200 --> 01:09:51,400
Well, I feel better knowing you know.

952
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:53,200
- You feel better?
- A bit.

953
01:09:53,200 --> 01:09:55,000
How dare you feel better?

954
01:09:55,100 --> 01:09:56,500
You've killed my fiancé,

955
01:09:56,600 --> 01:09:58,500
wrapped him up
in the one remaining family heirloom

956
01:09:58,500 --> 01:10:00,000
you haven't auctioned off online,

957
01:10:00,100 --> 01:10:02,500
and I only find about it
'cause there's a corpse in your bed,

958
01:10:02,600 --> 01:10:03,900
and I'm the one up for murder?

959
01:10:04,000 --> 01:10:06,100
Some things are better
if you just get them out in the open,

960
01:10:06,200 --> 01:10:07,500
you can talk about them and, you know...

961
01:10:07,600 --> 01:10:09,100
Oh, like murder?

962
01:10:11,400 --> 01:10:14,000
So, now what?
You gonna knock me off, too?

963
01:10:14,100 --> 01:10:15,900
No, you're my sister.

964
01:10:17,300 --> 01:10:19,200
How would that help me?

965
01:10:20,100 --> 01:10:21,200
Hello?

966
01:10:22,400 --> 01:10:24,500
Look, I'm sorry
about all this, I really am,

967
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:26,500
and not just because
you're the one going to jail for it.

968
01:10:26,600 --> 01:10:28,400
- Why are you such an idiot?
- Oh, I got dropped on my...

969
01:10:28,400 --> 01:10:30,000
Rhetorical.

970
01:10:30,800 --> 01:10:32,900
- What do we do now?
- Who's "we"?

971
01:10:33,000 --> 01:10:34,700
What do I do now?

972
01:10:35,300 --> 01:10:38,400
The way I see it,
you've got two options, jail...

973
01:10:39,800 --> 01:10:41,000
Okay.

974
01:10:41,500 --> 01:10:45,200
- No, you go to jail.
- Oh, I don't like that so much.

975
01:10:45,300 --> 01:10:46,900
Or get rid of the body.

976
01:10:47,000 --> 01:10:51,700
- I have tried that.
- Yeah, but I haven't.

977
01:10:52,000 --> 01:10:53,600
Are you kidding?

978
01:10:56,500 --> 01:10:57,900
Can't come back if it's in pieces.

979
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,500
- It has a name. Its name is Ryan.
- What do you want?

980
01:11:00,600 --> 01:11:02,900
Little bits can't drag themselves
out of the lake and up the hill.

981
01:11:02,900 --> 01:11:04,500
Well, you're pretty cavalier
with the power tools.

982
01:11:04,600 --> 01:11:07,900
- I thought you loved this guy.
- I did, very, very much.

983
01:11:08,000 --> 01:11:09,200
But you've taken him away from me

984
01:11:09,300 --> 01:11:10,900
and made me an accessory to murder,
haven't you?

985
01:11:11,000 --> 01:11:12,100
Involuntary manslaughter.

986
01:11:12,200 --> 01:11:13,500
I'm doing this for both of us.

987
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:16,000
I'm not sure I want
either of us to be doing this.

988
01:11:16,100 --> 01:11:17,900
Oh, jail it is then.

989
01:11:18,900 --> 01:11:20,500
I'll be outside.

990
01:11:36,900 --> 01:11:38,500
Voilà.

991
01:11:38,600 --> 01:11:40,400
You can't feed him that.

992
01:11:40,400 --> 01:11:42,800
Why not? The raw-food diet
is supposed to be good for them.

993
01:11:42,900 --> 01:11:46,200
Apparently, it'll give him a shiny coat
and his poo won't smell.

994
01:11:46,300 --> 01:11:48,400
You're feeding Ryan to Mars.

995
01:11:48,500 --> 01:11:51,300
No, not all at once.
I don't want him to get sick.

996
01:11:51,400 --> 01:11:53,200
What about me?

997
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:55,300
We could scatter him
around the garden, I guess,

998
01:11:55,400 --> 01:11:59,300
but there's always a chance
that they'll find him. Well, some of him.

999
01:12:02,600 --> 01:12:04,800
It just seems wrong.

1000
01:12:04,800 --> 01:12:06,900
That's because it is wrong.

1001
01:12:44,900 --> 01:12:47,500
You look awful. Soy turkey?

1002
01:12:49,100 --> 01:12:50,300
I'm still a bit queasy.

1003
01:12:50,400 --> 01:12:53,100
Well, it could have something to do
with the whole body-in-the-blender thing.

1004
01:12:53,200 --> 01:12:55,600
Didn't bother you
when you killed him though, did it?

1005
01:12:55,700 --> 01:12:57,200
Not as much as the mincing.

1006
01:12:57,300 --> 01:13:00,600
What can I say? When it comes to murder,
cleanup is a bitch.

1007
01:13:00,700 --> 01:13:03,500
None of this was supposed to happen.
This is terrible.

1008
01:13:03,600 --> 01:13:04,900
What's the problem?
I'm helping you out here.

1009
01:13:05,000 --> 01:13:07,500
This is the problem.
Shouldn't you be more upset?

1010
01:13:07,500 --> 01:13:09,100
- Oh, I could be madder.
- Or saner.

1011
01:13:09,200 --> 01:13:11,900
- This, coming from you?
- Hey, takes one to know one.

1012
01:13:11,900 --> 01:13:13,500
I don't want this.

1013
01:13:13,600 --> 01:13:15,800
I'm doing what I have to do
because my only living relative

1014
01:13:15,800 --> 01:13:17,900
is a murdering psychopath.

1015
01:13:38,600 --> 01:13:39,700
Mars?

1016
01:13:41,500 --> 01:13:42,700
Hey.

1017
01:13:44,100 --> 01:13:45,600
What you doing?

1018
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:49,900
Mars?

1019
01:13:50,500 --> 01:13:52,900
Mars, it's me, Patrick, remember?

1020
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:54,800
Patrick.

1021
01:13:57,300 --> 01:13:58,400
Mars?

1022
01:14:11,400 --> 01:14:13,400
You're feeding him to the neighbors' dogs?

1023
01:14:13,500 --> 01:14:15,500
Mars can't eat him all.

1024
01:14:16,100 --> 01:14:18,100
- Why not?
- Well, there's quite a bit.

1025
01:14:18,100 --> 01:14:22,600
He didn't look like that big of a guy
but we have made quite a meal out of him.

1026
01:14:26,100 --> 01:14:28,200
Can you get the door for me?

1027
01:14:29,700 --> 01:14:30,800
No.

1028
01:14:37,500 --> 01:14:39,500
This is bad. He was a good guy.

1029
01:14:39,600 --> 01:14:42,200
- What?
- Ryan, he was a good guy.

1030
01:14:42,200 --> 01:14:44,400
- I thought you hated him.
- I did at the time.

1031
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:47,800
- At the time he was alive?
- Well, yes, he made great breakfast.

1032
01:14:47,900 --> 01:14:50,800
Well, now he can make
great lunches and dinners as well.

1033
01:14:50,800 --> 01:14:52,300
That's not funny.

1034
01:14:52,300 --> 01:14:54,000
Why didn't you think of this
before he was dead?

1035
01:14:54,100 --> 01:14:56,200
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't know
what it would be like if he was dead

1036
01:14:56,200 --> 01:14:58,900
until after he was dead.
I'm having a hard time with this.

1037
01:14:59,000 --> 01:15:00,100
How do you think I feel?

1038
01:15:00,200 --> 01:15:02,100
Well, to be honest,
I'm finding your whole response

1039
01:15:02,200 --> 01:15:03,600
to murder thing a little peculiar.

1040
01:15:03,600 --> 01:15:05,700
Oh, I'm sorry,
is there some sort of standard response?

1041
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:06,800
How am I supposed to respond?

1042
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,300
Oh, I don't know,
maybe not quite so eager

1043
01:15:08,400 --> 01:15:10,400
to turn your soul mate into Kibbles 'n Bits.

1044
01:15:10,500 --> 01:15:12,800
These are not the actions of a vegetarian!

1045
01:15:12,800 --> 01:15:15,700
- What happened to ovo-lacto-pesco, huh?
- Bless you.

1046
01:15:15,700 --> 01:15:17,300
He had a face.

1047
01:15:17,300 --> 01:15:19,600
He had a cute, fuzzy face.

1048
01:15:19,700 --> 01:15:22,000
You should be happy.
You wanted him gone, he's gone.

1049
01:15:22,100 --> 01:15:25,100
I'm just the aid
in aiding and abetting, remember?

1050
01:15:25,200 --> 01:15:27,500
I wish he wasn't dead.

1051
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:31,200
I can't eat, I can't sleep,
I can't think straight.

1052
01:15:31,200 --> 01:15:34,000
- I can't stand this anymore.
- Why not?

1053
01:15:34,100 --> 01:15:37,900
- Mars can't even look me in the eyes.
- Guilty conscience?

1054
01:15:38,000 --> 01:15:39,100
Me or the dog?

1055
01:15:39,200 --> 01:15:43,800
Ryan was a caring, honest, funny man,
and you took him away from me.

1056
01:15:43,900 --> 01:15:45,800
I've done a terrible thing.

1057
01:15:45,800 --> 01:15:47,600
I've dragged
the two most important people

1058
01:15:47,700 --> 01:15:49,500
in my life down with me.

1059
01:15:49,600 --> 01:15:51,400
Okay, one of them is a dog,
but you know what I mean.

1060
01:15:51,500 --> 01:15:52,700
I think so.

1061
01:15:52,700 --> 01:15:54,200
You were right and I was wrong.

1062
01:15:54,200 --> 01:15:57,000
The guy was a keeper
and I threw him away.

1063
01:15:57,100 --> 01:15:59,100
I'm very, very sorry.

1064
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,200
- Ryan.
- Ryan!

1065
01:16:03,500 --> 01:16:07,900
- Ryan.
- Ryan!

1066
01:16:09,500 --> 01:16:10,600
Ryan.

1067
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:41,500
Detective?

1068
01:16:58,100 --> 01:16:59,700
Ryan!

1069
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,400
No.

1070
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:04,000
I buried you. I sank you.

1071
01:17:04,100 --> 01:17:06,000
She cut you up!

1072
01:17:06,100 --> 01:17:09,600
He's back!
He's back and you fed him to the dogs!

1073
01:17:14,100 --> 01:17:15,300
No, no, Patrick, I'm not dead.

1074
01:17:19,500 --> 01:17:20,800
Not dead.

1075
01:17:21,500 --> 01:17:22,700
Undead!

1076
01:17:25,200 --> 01:17:26,900
Escape, Marilyn!

1077
01:17:26,900 --> 01:17:31,400
Save yourself! I'll send this abomination
back to the hell from whence it came!

1078
01:17:31,500 --> 01:17:34,600
No, seriously, I didn't die.
You didn't kill me.

1079
01:17:44,200 --> 01:17:46,400
But look at you.

1080
01:17:46,500 --> 01:17:48,500
I know, it's all in the makeup.

1081
01:17:48,500 --> 01:17:51,200
You're sweet, but it was you
that made the character so alive.

1082
01:17:51,300 --> 01:17:52,700
Thanks, babe.

1083
01:17:52,800 --> 01:17:55,000
- You were so dead.
- He was, wasn't he?

1084
01:17:55,100 --> 01:17:57,700
Honey, I wanted to get a few shots
for my portfolio before you messed it up.

1085
01:17:57,800 --> 01:17:59,800
Oh, I'm sorry, sugar lips.

1086
01:18:02,200 --> 01:18:04,700
- I didn't kill you?
- No.

1087
01:18:04,700 --> 01:18:06,900
We knew you'd never come around
to accepting Ryan on your own,

1088
01:18:07,000 --> 01:18:09,900
so we just thought
we'd give you a little nudge.

1089
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:11,300
Little nudge?

1090
01:18:11,400 --> 01:18:13,700
I choreographed
the ladder accident myself,

1091
01:18:13,800 --> 01:18:15,700
<i>using my stunt training.</i>

1092
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:19,400
I never went for groceries.

1093
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:21,700
She was hiding in the backyard
working on my make up.

1094
01:18:21,700 --> 01:18:23,500
<i>And I kept you busy
on the phone.</i>

1095
01:18:23,500 --> 01:18:26,200
<i>Birdless tofu turkey coupons.</i>

1096
01:18:26,300 --> 01:18:28,700
But I buried you.

1097
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:31,300
No, actually you buried him.

1098
01:18:33,400 --> 01:18:35,800
- What is that?
- An inflatable sex man.

1099
01:18:35,900 --> 01:18:39,500
- An inflatable sex man. What...
- I filled him with water.

1100
01:18:41,700 --> 01:18:43,700
<i>Marilyn had him laying around.
He was perfect.</i>

1101
01:18:43,800 --> 01:18:45,400
Yes, yes he was.

1102
01:18:46,900 --> 01:18:49,400
Perfect for staging my honey's death.

1103
01:18:52,000 --> 01:18:53,100
I threw you in the lake.

1104
01:18:53,100 --> 01:18:55,400
<i>Yes, yes you did.</i>

1105
01:18:55,500 --> 01:18:56,900
<i>Inflatable.</i>

1106
01:18:57,000 --> 01:19:00,100
- He's a floater.
- Amongst other talents.

1107
01:19:00,200 --> 01:19:02,200
The police, what about the police?

1108
01:19:04,000 --> 01:19:06,700
Just me,
sweet cheeks, only me.

1109
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:10,000
- You saw me naked.
- Oh, yeah.

1110
01:19:11,700 --> 01:19:13,100
Thank you.

1111
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:18,700
- Thank you for not being dead.
- Thanks for not killing me.

1112
01:19:18,700 --> 01:19:20,500
Come here, big guy.

1113
01:19:22,900 --> 01:19:24,500
You, you are so evil.

1114
01:19:25,900 --> 01:19:28,600
And you, you're like Scottish evil.

1115
01:19:28,700 --> 01:19:30,600
But that was so good.

1116
01:19:30,700 --> 01:19:33,500
I knew you and Ryan would hit it off.
You just couldn't admit it to yourself.

1117
01:19:33,600 --> 01:19:35,100
I admit it! I admit it!

1118
01:19:35,200 --> 01:19:37,900
I found the perfect woman and
now I finally got a brother of my own.

1119
01:19:38,000 --> 01:19:40,200
Yes. Yes, you did.

1120
01:19:40,300 --> 01:19:43,100
- Can you...
- This is so beautiful.

1121
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:46,300
- Brother?
- Oh, would you listen to that?

1122
01:19:46,300 --> 01:19:48,000
I'm getting a bit weepy here.

1123
01:19:48,000 --> 01:19:51,100
- What do you need, bro?
- Stop hug now.

1124
01:19:51,100 --> 01:19:52,400
Pepe.

1125
01:19:55,100 --> 01:19:56,100
Sorry, dude.

1126
01:19:57,100 --> 01:19:58,600
<i>With her out of the way,
we've got the world,</i>

1127
01:19:58,700 --> 01:20:00,700
<i>the power to be who we wanna be.</i>

1128
01:20:00,800 --> 01:20:04,500
<i>These feelings are so new to me.
How can I trust them?</i>

1129
01:20:04,600 --> 01:20:08,800
<i>I've learned kilos by almost losing you
to that Paranta freezian bounty hunter.</i>

1130
01:20:08,900 --> 01:20:11,500
<i>How could I ever again risk that
when my love for you is infinite?</i>

1131
01:20:11,600 --> 01:20:14,400
<i>As infinite as the crushing force
of an imploding star.</i>

1132
01:20:14,400 --> 01:20:15,700
<i>Oh, Colt.</i>

1133
01:20:18,200 --> 01:20:19,900
<i>I was sad to see her go.</i>

1134
01:20:20,000 --> 01:20:22,100
<i>Sad to leave that glimmering beauty
from another race</i>

1135
01:20:22,100 --> 01:20:23,900
<i>so different from my own.</i>

1136
01:20:24,000 --> 01:20:28,400
<i>But happy. Happy to be back amongst
the red-hot, fiery solar winds</i>

1137
01:20:28,400 --> 01:20:32,100
<i>that would take me
to the icy-blue planets of the perimeter.</i>

1138
01:20:39,400 --> 01:20:41,700
- That'll be her.
- Oh, great, she found it.

1139
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:45,300
- Oh, great, she did. Who's she?
- Oh, no.

1140
01:20:45,400 --> 01:20:46,400
What?

1141
01:20:46,500 --> 01:20:48,800
In all the excitement,
we totally forgot to tell you.

1142
01:20:48,900 --> 01:20:51,700
- What? So tell me now.
- My little sis.

1143
01:20:51,700 --> 01:20:52,700
Sister?

1144
01:20:52,800 --> 01:20:55,200
Yeah, she's coming
to help with the wedding.

1145
01:20:55,300 --> 01:20:56,300
Oh.

1146
01:20:56,400 --> 01:20:58,000
- What?
- Nothing.

1147
01:20:58,100 --> 01:21:00,100
- What's wrong?
- It's nothing.

1148
01:21:00,100 --> 01:21:01,300
Great.

1149
01:21:01,400 --> 01:21:04,700
I've just really been enjoying
all the quality time, you know?

1150
01:21:04,800 --> 01:21:07,900
- Get out of here.
- You'll love her.

1151
01:21:14,600 --> 01:21:16,500
I mean, did you have to park
across the driveway?

1152
01:21:16,500 --> 01:21:18,400
I never liked that bush anyway.

1153
01:21:18,400 --> 01:21:21,400
- You still gonna marry him?
- Elise, please.

1154
01:21:21,500 --> 01:21:24,200
So, you couldn't talk them out of this?

1155
01:21:25,000 --> 01:21:27,100
- Oh, he tried.
- Really?

1156
01:21:27,200 --> 01:21:29,400
- Really.
- I like him already.

1157
01:21:30,200 --> 01:21:32,400
- Elise, remember what I said?
- What? You said be myself.

1158
01:21:32,500 --> 01:21:34,700
- I never said that.
- Oh, whatever.

1159
01:21:34,700 --> 01:21:39,000
This is my future brother-in-law, Patrick.
Patrick, this is my sister, Elise.

1160
01:21:39,000 --> 01:21:40,100
Hi.

1161
01:21:42,300 --> 01:21:43,500
Hello.

1162
01:21:49,600 --> 01:21:52,200
You are beautiful.

1163
01:21:52,300 --> 01:21:55,500
- Whoa, there.
- Well, you're not bad yourself.

1164
01:21:55,600 --> 01:21:58,900
Well, perhaps you'd like me
to show you around?

1165
01:22:00,800 --> 01:22:03,000
Perhaps I would.

1166
01:22:03,000 --> 01:22:04,900
Oh, no, no, not gonna happen.

1167
01:22:04,900 --> 01:22:07,200
- Maybe I'll do the showing.
- No, no, no, I'm on it.

1168
01:22:07,300 --> 01:22:09,700
- Okay, let's go, come on.
- Yeah.

1169
01:22:09,800 --> 01:22:11,500
That was the living room.

1170
01:22:11,500 --> 01:22:13,800
No, no, you're not.

1171
01:22:13,800 --> 01:22:17,400
You, you are coming with me.

1172
01:27:41,800 --> 01:27:43,300
All of us!

1173
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,600
Now, turn that bloody thing off!
