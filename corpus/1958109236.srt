1
00:00:51,790 --> 00:00:53,304
I'll take caller number seven right now.

2
00:00:53,314 --> 00:00:55,359
Oh, man, this is caller seven!

3
00:00:55,403 --> 00:00:56,969
- Huh?
- I'm caller seven, right?

4
00:00:57,013 --> 00:00:58,526
You're caller number seven.
Who is this?

5
00:00:58,536 --> 00:01:00,103
This is Butcher Duke!

6
00:01:00,147 --> 00:01:02,801
Do I get to play for the home or what?

7
00:01:02,845 --> 00:01:04,663
I mean, Kathy and I
have been dreaming about this

8
00:01:04,673 --> 00:01:05,761
ever since we first saw 'em

9
00:01:05,804 --> 00:01:07,893
drive by on the highway, you know?

10
00:01:07,937 --> 00:01:09,373
Now, if you beat Creek Thompson

11
00:01:09,417 --> 00:01:11,114
two out of three games,

12
00:01:11,158 --> 00:01:13,508
you win a manufactured home.

13
00:01:13,551 --> 00:01:14,639
You bet I do!

14
00:01:14,683 --> 00:01:15,945
It's so funny 'cause people say

15
00:01:15,988 --> 00:01:17,468
these are tornado magnets,

16
00:01:17,512 --> 00:01:18,991
you know, these manufactured houses,

17
00:01:19,035 --> 00:01:20,155
and I say, "No, they're not.

18
00:01:20,167 --> 00:01:21,690
They're not tornado magnets."

19
00:01:21,733 --> 00:01:23,126
It's not like tornado's like,

20
00:01:23,170 --> 00:01:25,259
"Ooh, ooh, manufactured house."

21
00:01:25,302 --> 00:01:28,871
You know, what I tell people
is, "Look, if God wants ya,

22
00:01:28,914 --> 00:01:30,438
he's gonna take ya."

23
00:01:30,481 --> 00:01:33,571
I think this is God's way of showing me.

24
00:01:33,615 --> 00:01:35,791
You know, "This is it, Butch.

25
00:01:35,834 --> 00:01:37,749
You can do it."

26
00:01:47,063 --> 00:01:52,155
I tell ya, I mean, of course,
I'm human, I have some doubts.

27
00:01:52,199 --> 00:01:54,940
Butcher had a chance to win at state

28
00:01:54,984 --> 00:01:56,681
and he lost the first round.

29
00:01:59,031 --> 00:02:01,469
I'm content where I am, I'm happy,

30
00:02:01,512 --> 00:02:03,645
but I know if I can win this home,

31
00:02:03,688 --> 00:02:05,560
man, it'll make things better.

32
00:02:27,059 --> 00:02:29,584
Game end match, Mr. Thompson.

33
00:02:30,802 --> 00:02:32,369
Not only did Butcher lose

34
00:02:32,413 --> 00:02:35,764
a double-wide mobile home that day,

35
00:02:35,807 --> 00:02:39,768
he also lost a big piece
of his warrior heart.

36
00:02:41,161 --> 00:02:44,642
Some say he's never been the same since.

37
00:02:54,783 --> 00:02:56,567
All right, guys, so why are we here?

38
00:02:56,611 --> 00:02:59,135
- To have fun!
- Why is that?

39
00:02:59,179 --> 00:03:01,355
Because we're not very good.

40
00:03:01,398 --> 00:03:03,052
Not very good.

41
00:03:03,095 --> 00:03:05,097
We had a tough year last year,
didn't we, Knox?

42
00:03:05,141 --> 00:03:08,057
- Yeah.
- We didn't win a match.

43
00:03:08,100 --> 00:03:09,928
But guess what.

44
00:03:09,972 --> 00:03:11,669
That was okay with me.

45
00:03:11,713 --> 00:03:13,236
I had a great time with you guys.

46
00:03:13,280 --> 00:03:14,585
I feel closer to you.

47
00:03:14,629 --> 00:03:16,316
I mean, really,
I'd call you my best friends

48
00:03:16,326 --> 00:03:18,285
if that wasn't a little weird.

49
00:03:18,328 --> 00:03:19,938
I've got goals for the team,

50
00:03:19,982 --> 00:03:21,766
but I need to know what your goals are.

51
00:03:21,810 --> 00:03:23,333
Okay, Faith, what do we got?

52
00:03:23,377 --> 00:03:26,684
I really want to learn
a between-a-leg shot.

53
00:03:26,728 --> 00:03:29,034
That's my favorite shot,
we're gonna work on that.

54
00:03:29,078 --> 00:03:30,166
Kaylee, what do we got?

55
00:03:30,210 --> 00:03:31,994
I want to be able to serve straight.

56
00:03:32,037 --> 00:03:34,779
Yeah, I don't think
you got a serve in last year.

57
00:03:34,823 --> 00:03:37,304
Knox, what do you got,
what's your goal this year?

58
00:03:37,347 --> 00:03:40,220
To not cry.

59
00:03:40,263 --> 00:03:43,919
- How about you, Jack?
- I want a girlfriend.

60
00:03:43,962 --> 00:03:45,312
Me too.

61
00:03:45,355 --> 00:03:47,401
So, we got a match on Friday,

62
00:03:47,444 --> 00:03:49,751
and I decided to go to the east side

63
00:03:49,794 --> 00:03:51,709
to pick up some new blood.

64
00:03:51,753 --> 00:03:52,928
Make him feel welcome.

65
00:03:52,971 --> 00:03:54,277
John.

66
00:03:57,149 --> 00:03:59,239
Tell us a little bit about yourself, bud.

67
00:03:59,282 --> 00:04:01,893
I want to get better at self-expression,

68
00:04:01,937 --> 00:04:06,028
lyrical poetry, and dance, mainly.

69
00:04:06,071 --> 00:04:08,291
Well, piggy-backing off of John,

70
00:04:08,335 --> 00:04:10,293
I'm in anger management.

71
00:04:10,337 --> 00:04:12,295
And you all know I needed it.

72
00:04:12,339 --> 00:04:14,819
You know, I used to throw my racket.

73
00:04:14,863 --> 00:04:16,778
Sorry about that, Knox.

74
00:04:16,821 --> 00:04:21,565
I still can't drive or vote
or go roller skating.

75
00:04:22,958 --> 00:04:25,743
But guess what, I can coach tennis.

76
00:04:25,787 --> 00:04:28,659
And this year, we're gonna win a match,

77
00:04:28,703 --> 00:04:31,619
and I think it starts Friday
at Ramsey, right?

78
00:04:31,662 --> 00:04:33,185
- Yeah!
- Okay, who's gonna have

79
00:04:33,229 --> 00:04:35,144
a forehand this year?

80
00:04:35,187 --> 00:04:37,146
- That's right. Forehand.
- Forehand.

81
00:04:37,189 --> 00:04:38,669
- Backhand.
- Backhand.

82
00:04:38,713 --> 00:04:40,062
- Volley.
- Volley.

83
00:04:40,105 --> 00:04:41,281
- Lob.
- Lob.

84
00:04:41,324 --> 00:04:45,546
And between-the-legs overhead spin shot.

85
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,072
Start again!

86
00:05:02,432 --> 00:05:04,956
I hope you're enjoying
the Saturday afternoon movie,

87
00:05:05,000 --> 00:05:06,958
Over the Top, with Sly Stallone,

88
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:08,351
but I'll be quick.

89
00:05:08,395 --> 00:05:09,918
We have two bedrooms, three bedrooms,

90
00:05:09,961 --> 00:05:11,398
four bedrooms, five bedrooms,

91
00:05:11,441 --> 00:05:14,531
all the way up to two or three bedrooms.

92
00:05:14,575 --> 00:05:15,837
But, listen, believe me today.

93
00:05:15,880 --> 00:05:17,360
Come on down after the movie.

94
00:05:17,404 --> 00:05:20,407
I want to serve you quality today!

95
00:05:22,626 --> 00:05:26,151
- That was your dad.
- And he looked good.

96
00:05:26,195 --> 00:05:29,590
We looked at the numbers,
okay, and a big reason

97
00:05:29,633 --> 00:05:32,462
for your dad's success
was his commercial campaigns,

98
00:05:32,506 --> 00:05:34,116
so we were thinking...

99
00:05:34,159 --> 00:05:36,466
- Hire an actor.
- Why not do it with you?

100
00:05:36,510 --> 00:05:38,338
It's not easy being the son

101
00:05:38,381 --> 00:05:41,297
of an ex-tennis pro mobile home mogul,

102
00:05:41,341 --> 00:05:45,388
but with his daddy
evading taxes in South Vietnam,

103
00:05:45,432 --> 00:05:48,565
Delta's doing the best he can.

104
00:05:48,609 --> 00:05:50,262
- Oh.
- You are the one

105
00:05:50,306 --> 00:05:53,353
who's sitting in the executive chair, okay?

106
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:54,716
And you could really change this.

107
00:05:54,745 --> 00:05:56,268
I'm flattered, ladies, I really am,

108
00:05:56,312 --> 00:05:58,575
but, you know, I just...

109
00:05:58,619 --> 00:06:00,621
You're young and exciting.

110
00:06:00,664 --> 00:06:02,405
And think about it, with tiny homes,

111
00:06:02,449 --> 00:06:05,234
our audience is young people anyway.

112
00:06:05,277 --> 00:06:07,236
So what type of commercial are we thinking?

113
00:06:07,279 --> 00:06:08,368
Oh, a good one.

114
00:06:10,065 --> 00:06:12,763
I like that.

115
00:06:12,807 --> 00:06:15,636
- Hey, Don?
- Yeah, boss.

116
00:06:15,679 --> 00:06:17,594
Could you get us a camera?

117
00:06:17,638 --> 00:06:18,987
We're shooting a commercial.

118
00:06:19,030 --> 00:06:20,641
That sounds like a good idea.

119
00:06:26,821 --> 00:06:28,562
Yeah, all right, I got to go.

120
00:06:28,605 --> 00:06:30,172
I'll teach you later.

121
00:06:30,215 --> 00:06:31,913
Bye, guys! See you tomorrow.

122
00:06:31,956 --> 00:06:33,741
See you, Butch.

123
00:06:39,181 --> 00:06:41,009
- What's up, Gordy?
- Hey, Butch.

124
00:06:41,052 --> 00:06:42,358
Uh, where are we going?

125
00:06:42,402 --> 00:06:44,447
- I need a protein shake.
- Protein shake.

126
00:06:44,491 --> 00:06:47,407
Yeah, yeah, get in, let's go.

127
00:06:47,450 --> 00:06:50,148
The tag, and here comes
the man formerly known

128
00:06:50,192 --> 00:06:53,282
as Will Lockhart, now under the spell...

129
00:06:53,325 --> 00:06:54,979
Oh, I'm hungry, Mom.

130
00:06:55,023 --> 00:06:56,764
Well, there's things in the fridge.

131
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,374
Help yourself.

132
00:07:00,028 --> 00:07:01,028
What?

133
00:07:03,074 --> 00:07:05,990
Oh my gosh, Emily is getting married?

134
00:07:06,034 --> 00:07:08,602
Who's Ellis?

135
00:07:08,645 --> 00:07:11,387
Dadgummit, why didn't you tell me this?

136
00:07:11,431 --> 00:07:13,824
I thought you and Emily were gonna talk.

137
00:07:13,868 --> 00:07:16,653
You know we haven't talked in forever, Mom.

138
00:07:16,697 --> 00:07:18,699
Gosh, look at this guy.

139
00:07:18,742 --> 00:07:19,830
He kind of looks like me.

140
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:25,662
Oh, hey, did you finish
your side of the guest list

141
00:07:25,706 --> 00:07:27,925
for... so we can start
sending out invitations?

142
00:07:27,969 --> 00:07:30,232
Uh, yeah, I've got,
like, an idea in my head.

143
00:07:30,275 --> 00:07:33,757
Um, I know I want to invite my Uncle Greg

144
00:07:33,801 --> 00:07:36,020
and that side of the family
like my cousins.

145
00:07:36,064 --> 00:07:37,534
Yeah, are they... they're driving in?

146
00:07:37,544 --> 00:07:38,926
- Yeah, driving in.
- Oh, that's great.

147
00:07:38,936 --> 00:07:39,971
I'm so glad they can make it.

148
00:07:39,981 --> 00:07:41,112
I know.

149
00:07:41,156 --> 00:07:44,028
And, then, obviously my paintball team.

150
00:07:44,072 --> 00:07:47,467
Um, how many is that?

151
00:07:47,510 --> 00:07:49,860
Um...

152
00:07:49,904 --> 00:07:52,210
I think it's 20, about.

153
00:07:52,254 --> 00:07:54,822
- Twenty? Twenty people?
- Can we maybe just invite,

154
00:07:54,865 --> 00:07:56,998
like, half of the paintball team?

155
00:07:57,041 --> 00:08:00,262
I guess we could invite
just, like, the Raptors,

156
00:08:00,305 --> 00:08:03,178
- but I mean...
- Okay, who's on the Raptors?

157
00:08:03,221 --> 00:08:06,398
Tyler, Matt, Ben, Reggie,

158
00:08:06,442 --> 00:08:08,488
the one with the glass eye.

159
00:08:08,531 --> 00:08:12,666
There's Jim, there's Chris, there's Danny.

160
00:08:12,709 --> 00:08:14,145
And that's just the defense.

161
00:08:14,189 --> 00:08:18,410
So the offense is Tim, Brad, Matt, Carter.

162
00:08:18,454 --> 00:08:20,282
If I invite Carter, I have to invite Marcus

163
00:08:20,325 --> 00:08:21,501
'cause he's, you know.

164
00:08:21,544 --> 00:08:24,329
Felony Marcus?

165
00:08:24,373 --> 00:08:25,766
- What?
- Felony Marcus?

166
00:08:25,809 --> 00:08:27,550
Don't bring up the felony again.

167
00:08:27,594 --> 00:08:29,334
It's always the felony with Marcus,

168
00:08:29,378 --> 00:08:31,467
the felony this, the felony that.

169
00:08:31,511 --> 00:08:35,079
They're my paintball team, babe!

170
00:08:36,994 --> 00:08:40,345
I'm sorry, I didn't mean to raise my voice.

171
00:08:40,389 --> 00:08:42,304
I'm just so stressed out.

172
00:08:42,347 --> 00:08:44,219
Babe, you don't need to be stressed.

173
00:08:44,262 --> 00:08:45,732
- Why are you stressing?
- I can't help it.

174
00:08:45,742 --> 00:08:48,789
There's a lot of expenditures
happening right now,

175
00:08:48,832 --> 00:08:50,399
and I'm kind of balling on a budget,

176
00:08:50,442 --> 00:08:52,749
and my couponing can only go so far.

177
00:08:52,793 --> 00:08:54,534
And I don't mean to be mean,
but your family

178
00:08:54,577 --> 00:08:57,885
is not really able to help out, and...

179
00:08:57,928 --> 00:09:00,844
Gosh, is your dad even gonna be there?

180
00:09:02,716 --> 00:09:04,805
Looks like Ellis is about to open

181
00:09:04,848 --> 00:09:06,807
a can of daddy issues.

182
00:09:06,850 --> 00:09:08,059
Can we just... can we just focus

183
00:09:08,069 --> 00:09:10,985
on the logistical stuff right now?

184
00:09:11,028 --> 00:09:13,248
Okay.

185
00:09:13,291 --> 00:09:16,991
- So, catering...
- Got it covered.

186
00:09:17,034 --> 00:09:20,472
Mom's got the gumbo
and all the broth premade,

187
00:09:20,516 --> 00:09:22,997
so we just got to heat it up
on the day of the wedding.

188
00:09:23,040 --> 00:09:25,695
Sorry, the broth?

189
00:09:25,739 --> 00:09:27,958
Yeah, I thought we talked about this.

190
00:09:28,002 --> 00:09:30,047
The broth from Thanksgiving?

191
00:09:30,091 --> 00:09:31,832
I was kind of thinking
we could do something

192
00:09:31,875 --> 00:09:35,139
a little nicer for the dinner.

193
00:09:35,183 --> 00:09:37,446
Nicer than chicken broth, babe?

194
00:09:37,489 --> 00:09:40,318
Oh, my arm is hurting.

195
00:09:40,362 --> 00:09:42,494
I'm having a heart attack.

196
00:09:42,538 --> 00:09:44,496
I don't know, guys.
I can't do this.

197
00:09:44,540 --> 00:09:45,933
Let's just hire an actor.

198
00:09:45,976 --> 00:09:49,284
Delta, look at me, look at Jennifer.

199
00:09:49,327 --> 00:09:51,112
Look at me.
Say, "I'm Delta Thompson."

200
00:09:51,155 --> 00:09:52,983
- I'm Delta Thompson.
- Say it again.

201
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,463
- I'm Delta Thompson?
- With force.

202
00:09:54,506 --> 00:09:56,247
- I'm Delta Thompson.
- One more time!

203
00:09:56,291 --> 00:09:57,597
I'm Delta Thompson!

204
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,076
Are you having a good day?

205
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,643
I know I am!

206
00:10:00,687 --> 00:10:03,559
Are you tired of living
in the dump you're living in?

207
00:10:03,603 --> 00:10:05,039
Well, not to fear

208
00:10:05,082 --> 00:10:07,345
because we've got the solution for you!

209
00:10:07,389 --> 00:10:08,390
That's right!

210
00:10:08,433 --> 00:10:10,044
And by the way,

211
00:10:10,087 --> 00:10:13,656
we have 0% APR financing,

212
00:10:13,700 --> 00:10:15,615
and I know what that means!

213
00:10:15,658 --> 00:10:18,879
We've got homes with one bathroom...

214
00:10:18,922 --> 00:10:20,837
- Two bedrooms!
- Two bedrooms!

215
00:10:24,711 --> 00:10:27,104
Oh, no!

216
00:10:27,148 --> 00:10:28,715
It looks like it broke!

217
00:10:28,758 --> 00:10:29,977
But guess what.

218
00:10:30,020 --> 00:10:32,153
We want to give you homes today.

219
00:10:32,196 --> 00:10:33,676
That's gonna be a thousand dollars.

220
00:10:33,720 --> 00:10:36,331
- You said $15 an hour.
- Mm, thousand dollars.

221
00:10:36,374 --> 00:10:37,854
I'm gonna need that right now.

222
00:10:37,898 --> 00:10:40,378
Ladies, you know I'm not good with numbers.

223
00:10:40,422 --> 00:10:42,554
It's an extra 15 for
the two wings you broke too.

224
00:10:42,598 --> 00:10:43,817
You broke that.

225
00:10:43,860 --> 00:10:45,732
I'm not God, I didn't create the wind.

226
00:10:45,775 --> 00:10:48,212
All right, let's see your grunts.

227
00:10:48,256 --> 00:10:50,084
Everybody's got to have a grunt.

228
00:10:50,127 --> 00:10:53,696
Serena, John McEnroe, Connors, Borg,

229
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:55,306
Dominique Ravicii.

230
00:10:55,350 --> 00:10:57,091
Okay, Djokovic, Murray.

231
00:10:57,134 --> 00:10:59,049
- Should I name more?
- No.

232
00:10:59,093 --> 00:11:02,009
Okay, all right, here we go.

233
00:11:02,052 --> 00:11:03,967
Oh, that was awesome!

234
00:11:04,011 --> 00:11:06,056
Let's go. Here we go, John.

235
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:08,189
Whoa, let's go, here we go, Jack.

236
00:11:09,669 --> 00:11:12,236
Okay, doesn't mean
you have to hit the ball hard

237
00:11:12,280 --> 00:11:14,586
'cause you didn't even touch the ball.

238
00:11:14,630 --> 00:11:18,155
So, Kaylee, don't tell
the rest of the kids this,

239
00:11:18,199 --> 00:11:21,115
but you're probably my favorite student.

240
00:11:21,158 --> 00:11:23,117
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

241
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:24,814
I said probably, not yet.

242
00:11:24,858 --> 00:11:26,294
I haven't made up my mind, but...

243
00:11:26,337 --> 00:11:29,863
- Okay.
- It's between you and Knox,

244
00:11:29,906 --> 00:11:33,605
Faith, and Jack, so...

245
00:11:33,649 --> 00:11:35,825
- Okay.
- Oh, look who's here.

246
00:11:35,869 --> 00:11:38,262
That's your dad.

247
00:11:40,787 --> 00:11:43,224
- Hey, Brad.
- How are you doing, Butch?

248
00:11:43,267 --> 00:11:44,965
You got it.

249
00:11:46,575 --> 00:11:47,837
Bye.

250
00:11:57,891 --> 00:11:59,109
Man, I don't know, Gordy.

251
00:11:59,153 --> 00:12:00,981
I've... I've thought about calling her,

252
00:12:01,024 --> 00:12:04,158
I've thought about,
you know, going to her work,

253
00:12:04,201 --> 00:12:07,161
try to catch her coming out.

254
00:12:07,204 --> 00:12:09,293
I don't know where she lives now,

255
00:12:09,337 --> 00:12:12,601
but maybe I could figure that out.

256
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:16,561
It's hard, man.

257
00:12:17,954 --> 00:12:18,999
Whose house is this?

258
00:12:20,957 --> 00:12:23,177
You know whose it is.

259
00:12:23,220 --> 00:12:25,745
We're at your estranged daughter's house.

260
00:12:30,750 --> 00:12:32,490
All right, here it goes.

261
00:12:32,534 --> 00:12:34,057
Emily?

262
00:12:35,493 --> 00:12:38,061
- Did you hear that?
- Emily?

263
00:12:38,105 --> 00:12:40,324
Hello?

264
00:12:40,368 --> 00:12:42,587
There you are.

265
00:12:42,631 --> 00:12:44,851
- Dad.
- Gosh.

266
00:12:44,894 --> 00:12:47,070
Hey. Butcher Duke.

267
00:12:47,114 --> 00:12:48,289
Sir, Ellis Perkins.

268
00:12:48,332 --> 00:12:50,595
It is so nice to meet you.

269
00:12:50,639 --> 00:12:51,683
Hey, Emily.

270
00:12:51,727 --> 00:12:53,860
- You look good.
- Thanks. You too.

271
00:12:53,903 --> 00:12:55,905
Uh, what are you... what are you doing here?

272
00:12:55,949 --> 00:12:58,603
Well, I heard my daughter
was getting married.

273
00:12:58,647 --> 00:13:01,868
I thought I'd come by
and say congratulations.

274
00:13:01,911 --> 00:13:04,044
- That's exciting.
- Yeah.

275
00:13:04,087 --> 00:13:06,133
Thank you, it means a lot.

276
00:13:06,176 --> 00:13:07,472
Things are... things are going well?

277
00:13:07,482 --> 00:13:09,005
You still working at the hospital?

278
00:13:09,049 --> 00:13:10,833
Yeah, yeah, I guess I've been working there

279
00:13:10,877 --> 00:13:12,661
for about a year, so...

280
00:13:12,704 --> 00:13:15,969
- It's going well?
- Yeah, I love it. It's great.

281
00:13:16,012 --> 00:13:17,840
You still playing tennis?

282
00:13:17,884 --> 00:13:19,189
Uh, no.

283
00:13:19,233 --> 00:13:20,800
I didn't know you played tennis.

284
00:13:20,843 --> 00:13:23,759
- She's good.
- Played in like middle school.

285
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:25,848
State runner-up.

286
00:13:27,371 --> 00:13:29,634
Em, I just...

287
00:13:29,678 --> 00:13:31,854
I just want to say, um,

288
00:13:31,898 --> 00:13:34,944
I know I wasn't the best father,

289
00:13:34,988 --> 00:13:38,034
but I'm different,
and I just want to let you know

290
00:13:38,078 --> 00:13:40,297
that I care about you.

291
00:13:42,212 --> 00:13:43,518
I just wanted to tell you that

292
00:13:43,561 --> 00:13:45,346
and, I don't know, you're getting married

293
00:13:45,389 --> 00:13:47,435
and I'd just, uh,

294
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:50,786
I'd just like to be
a part of it if I could.

295
00:13:50,830 --> 00:13:52,179
- Okay.
- Is anybody

296
00:13:52,222 --> 00:13:54,877
walking you down the aisle?

297
00:13:54,921 --> 00:13:58,098
Uh, yeah, so I think
I'm probably just gonna

298
00:13:58,141 --> 00:13:59,229
walk myself down the aisle.

299
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,579
Just keep it simple.

300
00:14:01,623 --> 00:14:03,538
Okay.

301
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:07,672
Okay, well, um...

302
00:14:07,716 --> 00:14:10,588
Well, gosh, it's good to meet you, Ellis.

303
00:14:10,632 --> 00:14:11,720
The pleasure is mine, sir.

304
00:14:11,763 --> 00:14:12,895
Truly.

305
00:14:12,939 --> 00:14:16,203
And, Emily, I'll see you around, okay?

306
00:14:16,246 --> 00:14:17,900
All right, bye, guys.

307
00:14:17,944 --> 00:14:19,336
Bye.

308
00:14:28,084 --> 00:14:30,043
Look, all I'm saying is,
I think it's pretty cool

309
00:14:30,086 --> 00:14:32,262
that your dad came by.

310
00:14:32,306 --> 00:14:34,298
I think so too. I think it was
really a big step for him,

311
00:14:34,308 --> 00:14:39,052
but I am not there yet, so...

312
00:14:40,401 --> 00:14:41,881
Okay.

313
00:14:41,924 --> 00:14:45,797
I mean, what did he do
that was so terrible?

314
00:14:45,841 --> 00:14:47,669
Um, I'll show you.

315
00:14:55,111 --> 00:14:58,158
Golly! Emily!

316
00:14:58,201 --> 00:14:59,724
- Dad!
- What?

317
00:14:59,768 --> 00:15:02,205
Stop, please!

318
00:15:02,249 --> 00:15:04,077
Your daughter is cheating.

319
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:06,166
Emily!

320
00:15:06,209 --> 00:15:07,297
Stop!

321
00:15:07,341 --> 00:15:10,648
- Oh, wow.
- Yeah.

322
00:15:10,692 --> 00:15:12,476
Dad, you're embarrassing me.

323
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:14,652
Get a ride home!

324
00:15:14,696 --> 00:15:18,047
Stop, you're embarrassing me.

325
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:21,964
What did you say?

326
00:15:25,750 --> 00:15:28,492
Wow he... he knows how to throw a punch.

327
00:15:28,536 --> 00:15:29,972
Mm.

328
00:15:31,365 --> 00:15:33,106
Your kid's a cheater, man!

329
00:15:33,149 --> 00:15:34,455
- Dad!
- What?

330
00:15:34,498 --> 00:15:36,979
Stop, please!

331
00:15:37,023 --> 00:15:38,328
Get a ride home.

332
00:15:38,372 --> 00:15:40,504
Get a ride home!

333
00:15:40,548 --> 00:15:43,116
Hey, that's my daughter.

334
00:15:43,159 --> 00:15:44,639
Agh!

335
00:15:44,682 --> 00:15:47,163
- Emily!
- Dad, stop.

336
00:15:50,558 --> 00:15:52,081
What'd you say, mofo?

337
00:15:52,125 --> 00:15:55,084
Golly! Emily!

338
00:15:55,128 --> 00:15:56,912
Come on, dear.

339
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,306
We've been shooting like 60%
for free throws.

340
00:15:59,349 --> 00:16:00,655
It's ridiculous.

341
00:16:00,698 --> 00:16:02,787
Thirty or forty feet from the basket.

342
00:16:02,831 --> 00:16:04,267
No way.

343
00:16:04,311 --> 00:16:05,790
Watch this, if they score here,

344
00:16:05,834 --> 00:16:07,260
I swear I'm gonna throw this remote.

345
00:16:07,270 --> 00:16:09,316
- Momma, I'll throw it.
- Do not throw my remote.

346
00:16:09,359 --> 00:16:11,100
I'll buy you a new one.

347
00:16:11,144 --> 00:16:13,146
I don't even smoke, but I want to start.

348
00:16:13,189 --> 00:16:16,366
Well, to cheer you up, look what I found

349
00:16:16,410 --> 00:16:17,977
in the attic last night.

350
00:16:18,020 --> 00:16:19,195
Oh my goodness.

351
00:16:19,239 --> 00:16:20,762
Look at that.

352
00:16:20,805 --> 00:16:24,070
- Little Butcher.
- Little me.

353
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,681
- Aww.
- Yeah, and...

354
00:16:26,724 --> 00:16:28,813
- Tennis rackets.
- Yeah.

355
00:16:28,857 --> 00:16:31,294
- What?
- And I need you to move out.

356
00:16:32,774 --> 00:16:35,559
- What?
- I need you to move out.

357
00:16:35,603 --> 00:16:36,952
Why?

358
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:39,520
You've been here ten years.

359
00:16:39,563 --> 00:16:40,782
Yeah?

360
00:16:40,825 --> 00:16:44,264
And because Jan is wanting a place to stay.

361
00:16:44,307 --> 00:16:47,136
I can share a room with Jan, Mom.

362
00:16:47,180 --> 00:16:49,704
Jan would not go for that.

363
00:16:49,747 --> 00:16:51,053
You don't know that.

364
00:16:51,097 --> 00:16:52,479
Well, how long are you gonna give me?

365
00:16:52,489 --> 00:16:54,448
Nine days.

366
00:16:54,491 --> 00:16:57,364
Nine days?

367
00:16:57,407 --> 00:16:59,496
- Nine days?
- Nine days.

368
00:17:03,152 --> 00:17:06,155
Sometimes life is hard, buddy.

369
00:17:06,199 --> 00:17:08,070
Even your mom will punch you in the gut

370
00:17:08,114 --> 00:17:10,681
every once in a while.

371
00:17:15,208 --> 00:17:18,254
Jump over him, nice.
Oh, that'll do it.

372
00:17:18,298 --> 00:17:21,562
- Hey!
- Hey, ladies. How's it going?

373
00:17:21,605 --> 00:17:24,565
Hey, uh, we just thought we'd come

374
00:17:24,608 --> 00:17:25,653
and talk a little bit,

375
00:17:25,696 --> 00:17:26,948
talk a little bit about the day.

376
00:17:26,958 --> 00:17:28,569
Okay, yeah.
How's the morning going?

377
00:17:28,612 --> 00:17:30,527
We're out of money.

378
00:17:31,789 --> 00:17:35,097
Okay. Uh, what do you mean?

379
00:17:35,141 --> 00:17:37,273
The houses aren't selling.

380
00:17:37,317 --> 00:17:40,363
Right, but, ladies, in English,
what do you mean?

381
00:17:40,407 --> 00:17:43,279
So we need to sell more and get more money

382
00:17:43,323 --> 00:17:45,542
or this business is over.

383
00:17:45,586 --> 00:17:46,891
Listen to me.

384
00:17:46,935 --> 00:17:49,764
My daddy always used to say,

385
00:17:49,807 --> 00:17:52,114
"Don't ever sell the business.

386
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,638
Even if you have to fire
your best employees,

387
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:56,727
even if you have to fire
Jennifer and Kelly,

388
00:17:56,771 --> 00:17:58,599
don't sell the business."

389
00:17:58,642 --> 00:18:00,253
I mean, word for word, he said that?

390
00:18:00,296 --> 00:18:04,039
He said, "Even if you have
to burn down the property

391
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:07,738
and claim insurance,
never sell the business."

392
00:18:07,782 --> 00:18:09,392
We said, "Oh, we ran out of lights.

393
00:18:09,436 --> 00:18:10,872
Oops, I knocked over a candle.

394
00:18:10,915 --> 00:18:12,265
Oops, that candle happened to be

395
00:18:12,308 --> 00:18:14,049
next to a trash can
full of gas."

396
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,095
- Okay, let's...
- We know you're stressed.

397
00:18:16,138 --> 00:18:19,968
But I think I have an idea to save us.

398
00:18:20,011 --> 00:18:21,317
Okay.

399
00:18:21,361 --> 00:18:24,190
Here we go. Let's go, Knox.

400
00:18:24,233 --> 00:18:26,322
Okay, little harder, little harder.

401
00:18:26,366 --> 00:18:27,454
Okay, that was terrible.

402
00:18:27,497 --> 00:18:29,369
One more.

403
00:18:29,412 --> 00:18:31,719
- All right, Kaylee, come on.
- Mr. Duke?

404
00:18:31,762 --> 00:18:32,894
- Come on.
- Uh, we're with

405
00:18:32,937 --> 00:18:34,417
Village Homes Tiny Homes.

406
00:18:34,461 --> 00:18:37,768
- Hey, how's it going?
- Creek Thompson's old business.

407
00:18:37,812 --> 00:18:39,640
Yeah? What do you want?

408
00:18:39,683 --> 00:18:41,903
We have a business proposition.

409
00:18:41,946 --> 00:18:42,860
Okay, hold on a sec.

410
00:18:42,904 --> 00:18:44,297
Hey, guys?

411
00:18:44,340 --> 00:18:46,071
Why don't you guys go ahead
and do some push-ups

412
00:18:46,081 --> 00:18:46,864
and sit-ups back there?

413
00:18:46,908 --> 00:18:50,303
Drop down, give me 120.

414
00:18:50,346 --> 00:18:52,043
- Butcher Duke.
- Jennifer Calloway.

415
00:18:52,087 --> 00:18:52,870
Lovely to meet you.

416
00:18:52,914 --> 00:18:54,394
Kelly Anderson, hi.

417
00:18:54,437 --> 00:18:56,439
- What's going on?
- We want to invite you

418
00:18:56,483 --> 00:18:58,920
to a big tennis rematch event,

419
00:18:58,963 --> 00:19:01,618
this time against Delta Thompson.

420
00:19:01,662 --> 00:19:06,493
And if you beat him,
you will win a tiny home.

421
00:19:06,536 --> 00:19:07,929
Okay.

422
00:19:07,972 --> 00:19:09,365
So...

423
00:19:09,409 --> 00:19:10,584
Think about it.

424
00:19:10,627 --> 00:19:12,455
- Think about it.
- What?

425
00:19:12,499 --> 00:19:14,979
What do you mean?

426
00:19:15,023 --> 00:19:16,590
Do I...

427
00:19:19,288 --> 00:19:20,507
You're gonna call me or...

428
00:19:22,291 --> 00:19:23,945
I'll call...

429
00:19:27,644 --> 00:19:30,038
It's not every day you get a second chance

430
00:19:30,081 --> 00:19:32,997
to play tennis for a tiny home.

431
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,000
What will Butcher do?

432
00:19:36,044 --> 00:19:38,568
What the hell's a tiny home?

433
00:19:38,612 --> 00:19:40,179
You've got to go for it.

434
00:19:40,222 --> 00:19:41,484
What if I lose again?

435
00:19:41,528 --> 00:19:43,007
So, you already lost.

436
00:19:43,051 --> 00:19:45,706
No one can think of you any less.

437
00:19:45,749 --> 00:19:49,971
Once you've hit rock bottom,
there's only one way: up.

438
00:19:50,014 --> 00:19:51,581
Okay, that's my line.

439
00:19:51,625 --> 00:19:53,225
All right, have you ever
had your heart ripped out

440
00:19:53,235 --> 00:19:54,715
on the tennis court?

441
00:19:54,758 --> 00:19:58,327
I was this close to winning
a double-wide mobile home,

442
00:19:58,371 --> 00:19:59,937
and I lost and it hurt.

443
00:19:59,981 --> 00:20:02,244
We lost every match last year.

444
00:20:02,288 --> 00:20:05,116
We're still showing up, though.

445
00:20:05,160 --> 00:20:09,382
I mean, you live with your mom, Butch.

446
00:20:11,384 --> 00:20:14,561
You got to go for it, Butch.

447
00:20:14,604 --> 00:20:16,258
So you guys really think I got a shot?

448
00:20:16,302 --> 00:20:18,565
Yeah.

449
00:20:18,608 --> 00:20:19,696
- Really?
- Yeah.

450
00:20:19,740 --> 00:20:23,091
Like, seventyish percent.

451
00:20:23,134 --> 00:20:25,267
- Fifty.
- Thirty-five.

452
00:20:25,311 --> 00:20:27,704
- Yeah.
- Thirty-five, yeah.

453
00:20:29,315 --> 00:20:31,621
Not as good as I wanted, but...

454
00:20:35,669 --> 00:20:37,975
Here he comes, the challenger!

455
00:20:38,019 --> 00:20:40,500
Out to win a manufactured home tonight:

456
00:20:40,543 --> 00:20:41,718
Butcher Duke!

457
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:42,893
Go, Butcher!

458
00:20:42,937 --> 00:20:44,286
Go, Butcher!

459
00:20:46,506 --> 00:20:48,377
Duke!

460
00:21:01,260 --> 00:21:04,175
Challenging Butcher Duke to a tennis match

461
00:21:04,219 --> 00:21:06,134
and the winner gets a tiny home, so...

462
00:21:06,177 --> 00:21:08,484
- Babe, look, it's Delta.
- And will the match be

463
00:21:08,528 --> 00:21:10,617
in one of the tiny homes?

464
00:21:12,401 --> 00:21:14,316
Yeah, wasn't he, like, a grade above us?

465
00:21:14,360 --> 00:21:16,100
- Yeah.
- June, I love you.

466
00:21:16,144 --> 00:21:17,885
Uh, you're great, uh...

467
00:21:17,928 --> 00:21:19,756
Didn't you date him?

468
00:21:19,800 --> 00:21:21,758
- No, I dated you.
- Oh.

469
00:21:21,802 --> 00:21:24,195
...the home that Butcher Duke
will be winning?

470
00:21:24,239 --> 00:21:27,373
Babe, look, it's your dad.

471
00:21:27,416 --> 00:21:30,201
Hold on!

472
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,028
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, sir,

473
00:21:31,072 --> 00:21:31,942
this is a live...

474
00:21:31,986 --> 00:21:33,466
This thing rolling?

475
00:21:33,509 --> 00:21:34,945
I'll tell you something.

476
00:21:34,989 --> 00:21:36,512
I'm Butcher Duke.

477
00:21:36,556 --> 00:21:41,125
I lost a mobile home
opportunity 20 years ago.

478
00:21:41,169 --> 00:21:42,997
Not this time.

479
00:21:43,040 --> 00:21:45,086
It means something this time.

480
00:21:45,129 --> 00:21:46,217
I lost my daughter.

481
00:21:46,261 --> 00:21:47,426
I haven't talked to her in two years.

482
00:21:47,436 --> 00:21:49,699
My wife's dead, she died in a mudslide.

483
00:21:49,743 --> 00:21:52,093
Okay, I live with my mom.
I'm 45.

484
00:21:52,136 --> 00:21:53,660
It's embarrassing.

485
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:56,271
I've been in anger management
for 18 months,

486
00:21:56,315 --> 00:21:58,229
but I'm a different person.

487
00:21:58,273 --> 00:22:00,754
So I'm here, and I'm here
to tell you, June,

488
00:22:00,797 --> 00:22:02,321
I accept this challenge.

489
00:22:02,364 --> 00:22:03,974
Yes!

490
00:22:04,018 --> 00:22:06,455
- You look good today, June.
- Thank you.

491
00:22:06,499 --> 00:22:08,631
Thank you.

492
00:22:08,675 --> 00:22:09,850
This is gonna be a fun match

493
00:22:09,893 --> 00:22:11,015
because you're gonna watch a young buck

494
00:22:11,025 --> 00:22:14,463
just pounce on an, uh, older man, uh...

495
00:22:17,161 --> 00:22:19,990
Oh, this is clearly getting
kind of emotional.

496
00:22:20,034 --> 00:22:21,470
- It's all right.
- What'd you say?

497
00:22:21,514 --> 00:22:23,646
Oh. Boys, we don't need

498
00:22:23,690 --> 00:22:25,256
to bring this to a violent place.

499
00:22:25,300 --> 00:22:27,433
- I'm gonna grab him...
- Pan in, pan in, pan in.

500
00:22:27,476 --> 00:22:29,652
Good. All right.

501
00:22:29,696 --> 00:22:31,496
Like I said, I've been
in anger management now

502
00:22:31,524 --> 00:22:33,264
for 18 months.

503
00:22:33,308 --> 00:22:34,614
I almost hit him.

504
00:22:34,657 --> 00:22:36,659
I wanted to hit him, but that's...

505
00:22:36,703 --> 00:22:37,660
Why aren't you more excited?

506
00:22:37,704 --> 00:22:39,575
Your dad is on TV right now.

507
00:22:39,619 --> 00:22:41,838
He's playing for a tiny home, babe.

508
00:22:41,882 --> 00:22:43,927
That's no small thing.

509
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:47,888
I mean, it's a small house,
but it's no small thing.

510
00:22:53,154 --> 00:22:55,939
- You think I can beat Delta?
- I do.

511
00:22:55,983 --> 00:22:57,623
I've always thought you could do anything

512
00:22:57,637 --> 00:22:59,073
you wanted to do.

513
00:22:59,116 --> 00:23:01,205
You know that.

514
00:23:02,685 --> 00:23:04,557
I just wish Kathy was here, you know?

515
00:23:04,600 --> 00:23:06,907
- I miss her.
- I miss her, too.

516
00:23:06,950 --> 00:23:09,126
I want to talk to Emily.

517
00:23:09,170 --> 00:23:10,737
Oh, well.

518
00:23:10,780 --> 00:23:14,175
Maybe winning a tiny home
will change everything.

519
00:23:48,078 --> 00:23:49,558
Everything okay there, Butch?

520
00:23:49,602 --> 00:23:52,387
Seem a little quiet.

521
00:23:52,431 --> 00:23:54,563
Yeah, I'm just...

522
00:23:54,607 --> 00:23:56,783
...just really missing
my wife today.

523
00:23:56,826 --> 00:23:59,394
Hm, I didn't know you were married.

524
00:23:59,438 --> 00:24:00,787
Oh, I'm not.

525
00:24:00,830 --> 00:24:03,354
She died in a mudslide.

526
00:24:08,838 --> 00:24:11,058
It's just hard, you know?

527
00:24:11,101 --> 00:24:12,102
Yeah.

528
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,582
I mean, it could be worse, right?

529
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:18,500
She could've died in,
you know, volcanic molten lava,

530
00:24:18,544 --> 00:24:19,944
you know, like my cousin Steve did.

531
00:24:25,594 --> 00:24:27,117
Wait a second.

532
00:24:27,161 --> 00:24:28,336
Where are we, Gordy?

533
00:24:28,379 --> 00:24:30,686
You know where we are.

534
00:24:30,730 --> 00:24:33,167
We're at your dead wife's grave.

535
00:24:33,210 --> 00:24:35,648
How do you know where my wife is buried?

536
00:24:35,691 --> 00:24:37,606
Go to her, Butch.

537
00:24:52,926 --> 00:24:55,015
Hey, Butch?

538
00:24:55,058 --> 00:24:56,277
It's not that one.

539
00:24:56,320 --> 00:24:57,887
It's the one over there.

540
00:24:57,931 --> 00:24:59,585
Yeah.

541
00:25:31,747 --> 00:25:33,009
Ah!

542
00:25:42,453 --> 00:25:43,977
Well, how'd you think I was hitting?

543
00:25:44,020 --> 00:25:46,109
I mean, I think you're hitting pretty well.

544
00:25:46,153 --> 00:25:47,241
You got a couple days left.

545
00:25:47,284 --> 00:25:48,580
I'd keep working on your backhand.

546
00:25:48,590 --> 00:25:50,505
- Yeah.
- Just keep drilling.

547
00:25:50,549 --> 00:25:52,507
- Serve is okay, though, right?
- Yeah.

548
00:25:52,551 --> 00:25:54,107
- I feel good about the serve.
- Looking good as ever.

549
00:25:54,117 --> 00:25:56,250
- Yeah.
- Maybe better.

550
00:25:56,293 --> 00:25:58,687
Ah, thanks, man. Yeah.

551
00:25:58,731 --> 00:26:01,168
So, what's the latest with you and Emily?

552
00:26:01,211 --> 00:26:03,953
- How are you guys?
- She's getting married, man.

553
00:26:03,997 --> 00:26:05,389
- Wow.
- I didn't even know

554
00:26:05,433 --> 00:26:07,827
she was engaged.

555
00:26:07,870 --> 00:26:09,263
You know, apparently, he's some,

556
00:26:09,306 --> 00:26:12,048
you know, state champion paintballer.

557
00:26:12,092 --> 00:26:13,310
I guess that pays these days.

558
00:26:13,354 --> 00:26:14,790
You know, people gamble online,

559
00:26:14,834 --> 00:26:18,315
they can play paintball,
make mon... I don't get it,

560
00:26:18,359 --> 00:26:19,882
know what I mean?

561
00:26:19,926 --> 00:26:22,624
You know, I just... yeah.

562
00:26:22,668 --> 00:26:26,367
Well, I don't... I don't mean
to be a big advice giver,

563
00:26:26,410 --> 00:26:28,151
but just don't give up.

564
00:26:28,195 --> 00:26:29,457
- Yeah.
- Don't give up.

565
00:26:31,633 --> 00:26:33,504
I can't, man.

566
00:26:33,548 --> 00:26:35,637
She's all I got.

567
00:26:43,123 --> 00:26:44,820
Dang.

568
00:26:44,864 --> 00:26:46,953
Ooh, okay, I already like this one.

569
00:26:46,996 --> 00:26:48,389
Okay.

570
00:26:48,432 --> 00:26:50,739
- It's pretty good.
- It's doughy.

571
00:26:50,783 --> 00:26:52,436
Look at this one.

572
00:26:52,480 --> 00:26:53,916
It's got a remote to it.

573
00:26:53,960 --> 00:26:57,398
- Oh, it's like a hospital bed?
- Yeah.

574
00:26:57,441 --> 00:26:58,921
Like, soft and firm.

575
00:26:58,965 --> 00:27:00,923
Oh my gosh, I don't know
if I'm gonna be able

576
00:27:00,967 --> 00:27:02,359
to get out of this.

577
00:27:02,403 --> 00:27:06,189
Like, I legitimately... I don't know.

578
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:09,628
It's like putting my face
in, like, a lamb's belly.

579
00:27:09,671 --> 00:27:11,455
Whoa, look at this giant one.

580
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,588
Can we get the huge one?

581
00:27:15,416 --> 00:27:17,331
I feel like royalty.

582
00:27:17,374 --> 00:27:19,899
I feel like I should have, like, jewels

583
00:27:19,942 --> 00:27:21,552
just draped around me.

584
00:27:21,596 --> 00:27:23,153
Yeah, this one is nice too 'cause, like,

585
00:27:23,163 --> 00:27:24,904
when I'm mad at you, I can be on my side

586
00:27:24,947 --> 00:27:26,732
and I don't have to touch you.

587
00:27:26,775 --> 00:27:28,288
Look how many kids we can fit in this bed.

588
00:27:28,298 --> 00:27:30,170
Oh my God, no, please.

589
00:27:30,213 --> 00:27:32,389
- Whoa.
- Oh, man.

590
00:27:32,433 --> 00:27:33,869
- That's it.
- You ready?

591
00:27:33,913 --> 00:27:35,349
Yes.

592
00:27:35,392 --> 00:27:37,960
Robobed.

593
00:27:40,180 --> 00:27:42,704
Oh, let's wake up, the baby is crying.

594
00:27:42,748 --> 00:27:45,098
Uh-oh, "Wah, Mom,
I need milk, Mom."

595
00:27:45,141 --> 00:27:47,317
The pregnancy joke is funny
when I make it, not you.

596
00:27:47,361 --> 00:27:48,536
Going back to bed.

597
00:27:53,236 --> 00:27:55,543
I can't wait to live with you.

598
00:27:56,805 --> 00:27:58,502
Me neither.

599
00:28:00,504 --> 00:28:02,593
Hey, Jennifer,
thanks again for staying late.

600
00:28:02,637 --> 00:28:04,160
I mean, that's what I'm here for.

601
00:28:05,945 --> 00:28:07,207
How's the training going?

602
00:28:07,250 --> 00:28:08,338
Oh, it's great, you know.

603
00:28:08,382 --> 00:28:11,080
Uh, my forehand, great.

604
00:28:11,124 --> 00:28:12,995
Backhand could use a little work.

605
00:28:13,039 --> 00:28:15,302
And I'm gonna surprise him
on my serve, I'm telling ya.

606
00:28:15,345 --> 00:28:17,260
That's good to hear.

607
00:28:17,304 --> 00:28:19,959
- Thanks so much.
- Yeah, of course.

608
00:28:20,002 --> 00:28:21,961
- Can I show you something?
- Yeah.

609
00:28:22,004 --> 00:28:24,659
So, this is one of my favorites.

610
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:25,965
His name is Wilburforce.

611
00:28:26,008 --> 00:28:27,662
They call him The Force because he... oh!

612
00:28:27,706 --> 00:28:28,968
You see that?

613
00:28:29,011 --> 00:28:30,133
Gets him at the hip, but guess what,

614
00:28:30,143 --> 00:28:31,405
he's gonna get back up.

615
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:32,657
He's a little squatty, a little scrawny,

616
00:28:32,667 --> 00:28:33,581
but that's what I like about him.

617
00:28:33,624 --> 00:28:34,887
He's energized, he's ready.

618
00:28:34,930 --> 00:28:37,193
Oh! Gets to jump over,
leaps over him.

619
00:28:37,237 --> 00:28:39,805
Pulls back, he leaps over him.

620
00:28:39,848 --> 00:28:40,980
Ah, oh, yeah.

621
00:28:41,023 --> 00:28:42,982
Ooh!

622
00:28:43,025 --> 00:28:44,548
Oh!

623
00:28:44,592 --> 00:28:46,986
Oh, wow!

624
00:28:47,029 --> 00:28:50,076
Hot dog.

625
00:28:50,119 --> 00:28:52,818
I don't know about you,
but that gets me jazzed.

626
00:28:52,861 --> 00:28:56,082
Yeah, I mean, I went to a WWE match...

627
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:59,215
- Whoa, professional?
- Yeah.

628
00:28:59,259 --> 00:29:00,651
That's amazing.

629
00:29:00,695 --> 00:29:03,698
Man, Jennifer, I just...

630
00:29:03,742 --> 00:29:05,037
I can't believe I'm asking you this,

631
00:29:05,047 --> 00:29:08,529
but if I can, after all this is over,

632
00:29:08,572 --> 00:29:13,403
take you out to dinner
somewhere nice like Cheddar's?

633
00:29:13,447 --> 00:29:15,449
- Yeah.
- Yeah?

634
00:29:15,492 --> 00:29:17,364
Yeah, I'd really like that.

635
00:29:19,409 --> 00:29:21,498
Man, hot dog!

636
00:29:21,542 --> 00:29:23,196
You did it, Delta, you asked her.

637
00:29:32,379 --> 00:29:34,163
Yeah, I should probably get that.

638
00:29:34,207 --> 00:29:36,557
- Yeah, I'll...
- All right.

639
00:29:36,600 --> 00:29:37,906
See you, Jennifer.

640
00:29:37,950 --> 00:29:41,040
- Have a good evening.
- Yeah, you too.

641
00:29:43,216 --> 00:29:45,479
Oh, hey, uh, Village Homes.

642
00:29:45,522 --> 00:29:47,350
Delta Thompson speaking.

643
00:29:47,394 --> 00:29:49,613
Oh, tiny homes, no, no, no,
you can be normal sized

644
00:29:49,657 --> 00:29:51,528
in a tiny home.

645
00:29:52,703 --> 00:29:54,488
Up.

646
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,490
Toss above the head.

647
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,927
Okay? So let's take a look
at you guys.

648
00:29:58,971 --> 00:30:01,887
Okay. The serve is the most
important part of the game.

649
00:30:04,063 --> 00:30:05,107
Okay.

650
00:30:08,371 --> 00:30:09,198
Okay, that's enough.

651
00:30:09,242 --> 00:30:11,026
There you go.

652
00:30:11,070 --> 00:30:12,811
Close, close.

653
00:30:12,854 --> 00:30:14,725
Last year, you hit rock bottom.

654
00:30:14,769 --> 00:30:16,249
Where do you go from here?

655
00:30:16,292 --> 00:30:17,946
- Up.
- Up, that's it.

656
00:30:17,990 --> 00:30:19,818
Okay, here we go.

657
00:30:22,037 --> 00:30:22,951
What?

658
00:30:22,995 --> 00:30:25,562
Oh, almost, Kaylee!

659
00:30:25,606 --> 00:30:26,694
All right.

660
00:30:26,737 --> 00:30:28,261
Good job on the serves.

661
00:30:28,304 --> 00:30:30,002
All right, so as you guys know,

662
00:30:30,045 --> 00:30:32,874
do you remember what Faith's goal was?

663
00:30:32,918 --> 00:30:36,530
- Between the legs?
- Between-the-legs shot.

664
00:30:36,573 --> 00:30:38,837
Okay, that's good.

665
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:40,099
Oh, that's close.

666
00:30:44,190 --> 00:30:45,713
- Hm.
- Did it make it?

667
00:30:45,756 --> 00:30:47,846
You think we should make you another goal?

668
00:30:47,889 --> 00:30:49,543
- Yeah.
- John?

669
00:30:49,586 --> 00:30:51,675
You want to show us
what you've been working on?

670
00:30:53,982 --> 00:30:57,464
Um, so, yeah, I've been
working on some poetry,

671
00:30:57,507 --> 00:30:59,770
so I thought I could
share it with you guys.

672
00:31:01,598 --> 00:31:03,687
"Tennis racket, tennis racket,

673
00:31:03,731 --> 00:31:05,211
I don't like you very much.

674
00:31:05,254 --> 00:31:06,516
You think you're great,

675
00:31:06,560 --> 00:31:08,431
but you're not great and stuff.

676
00:31:08,475 --> 00:31:12,174
You make me feel like it's hard to hit you.

677
00:31:12,218 --> 00:31:14,742
But, Trish, you know,
I could never quit you."

678
00:31:18,354 --> 00:31:20,879
- Woo! Yeah.
- Woo.

679
00:31:22,706 --> 00:31:25,884
Hey there, welcome to
Delta Thompson's virtual tour.

680
00:31:25,927 --> 00:31:28,190
Delta, you got this.

681
00:31:28,234 --> 00:31:30,932
Hey there, welcome to
Delta Thompson's virtual tour.

682
00:31:30,976 --> 00:31:32,934
I'm your host, Delta Thompson.

683
00:31:32,978 --> 00:31:35,284
Sure, sure, a tiny home
can most definitely fit

684
00:31:35,328 --> 00:31:36,851
four dogs, abs... absolutely.

685
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:38,277
I don't know why you're doubting that.

686
00:31:38,287 --> 00:31:40,681
This is our Colorado B-style house.

687
00:31:40,724 --> 00:31:42,509
This thing is high.

688
00:31:42,552 --> 00:31:45,164
Wow, it's long.

689
00:31:45,207 --> 00:31:48,471
Holy moly, and it's a tiny home.

690
00:31:48,515 --> 00:31:49,767
Are you kidding me?
Do you not know

691
00:31:49,777 --> 00:31:51,126
what APR financing is?

692
00:31:51,170 --> 00:31:54,303
You can see this thing
is full of ample space.

693
00:31:54,347 --> 00:31:57,741
I'm talking square feet upon square feet

694
00:31:57,785 --> 00:31:59,482
upon square feet.

695
00:31:59,526 --> 00:32:01,213
You come on down here,
you come on down today,

696
00:32:01,223 --> 00:32:02,877
I'll give you a tour myself.

697
00:32:02,921 --> 00:32:04,966
Full-blown kitchen with a working sink,

698
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:07,099
running water.

699
00:32:07,142 --> 00:32:08,839
Okay, it's not working right now.

700
00:32:08,883 --> 00:32:11,190
That's a love seat
for when you got those couples.

701
00:32:11,233 --> 00:32:14,758
Leopard blanket not included.

702
00:32:14,802 --> 00:32:17,152
Even rich people can't afford homes

703
00:32:17,196 --> 00:32:18,980
that withstand hurricanes, okay?

704
00:32:19,024 --> 00:32:20,590
Full-on medicine cabinet.

705
00:32:20,634 --> 00:32:23,158
That's right there... uh-oh, scary movie!

706
00:32:23,202 --> 00:32:25,378
Scary movie! It's just me.
Scary movie.

707
00:32:25,421 --> 00:32:27,413
Hey, ladies and gentlemen,
I just want you to subscribe

708
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,207
to my channel.

709
00:32:28,250 --> 00:32:29,208
It's right here.

710
00:32:29,251 --> 00:32:31,558
Yes, a mobile home is a...

711
00:32:31,601 --> 00:32:33,952
Okay, okay, well, if you want
to call me that, then...

712
00:32:38,782 --> 00:32:41,481
That was not very good.

713
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:48,314
Do you ever just have a tough day?

714
00:32:48,357 --> 00:32:50,794
How do you get through that?
What's the worst...

715
00:32:50,838 --> 00:32:52,492
...worst day
you've been through?

716
00:32:52,535 --> 00:32:53,797
Oh, there's been a lot of them,

717
00:32:53,841 --> 00:32:55,582
but you go home, you sleep it off,

718
00:32:55,625 --> 00:32:57,671
and you come back recharged.

719
00:32:57,714 --> 00:32:58,977
Yeah.

720
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,198
Don, what's it like to love someone

721
00:33:03,242 --> 00:33:05,461
for so many years?

722
00:33:07,333 --> 00:33:09,944
It's pretty good.

723
00:33:09,988 --> 00:33:11,728
We want to serve you...

724
00:33:11,772 --> 00:33:13,165
...quality homes...

725
00:33:13,208 --> 00:33:14,862
...today!

726
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,434
Are you tired of people
saying you have a lazy eye?

727
00:33:21,477 --> 00:33:23,784
He is so hot.

728
00:33:24,828 --> 00:33:26,787
When I was a little hijo,

729
00:33:26,830 --> 00:33:30,791
people used to make fun of my lazy oho.

730
00:33:30,834 --> 00:33:33,489
So come on down to Abe's Eye Repair.

731
00:33:33,533 --> 00:33:35,665
Get rid of that lazy eye
and get yourself...

732
00:33:35,709 --> 00:33:38,668
Ooh, I bet he smells like olive oil.

733
00:33:42,846 --> 00:33:44,674
Kind of not what I expected.

734
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:46,024
Wait.

735
00:33:47,329 --> 00:33:48,591
I think this is it.

736
00:33:53,074 --> 00:33:54,293
Yeah, definitely.

737
00:33:54,336 --> 00:33:56,338
It's him.

738
00:33:58,123 --> 00:34:00,560
Cut!

739
00:34:00,603 --> 00:34:02,127
This is a cool place.

740
00:34:02,170 --> 00:34:04,390
Wow, it's like a thrift shop,
but, like, professional.

741
00:34:04,433 --> 00:34:06,338
I'm kind of in the middle
of something important.

742
00:34:06,348 --> 00:34:08,002
- Can I help you?
- Kelly Anderson.

743
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:09,569
Jennifer Calloway.
Lovely to meet you.

744
00:34:09,612 --> 00:34:11,049
Village Homes Tiny House.

745
00:34:11,092 --> 00:34:12,692
Are you familiar with
the Village Homes Tiny House?

746
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:13,834
No idea.

747
00:34:13,877 --> 00:34:17,403
Introducing Wilburforce.

748
00:34:17,446 --> 00:34:19,187
A local hero

749
00:34:19,231 --> 00:34:21,494
who happens to be the most famous

750
00:34:21,537 --> 00:34:24,410
part-time minor league wrestler in town.

751
00:34:24,453 --> 00:34:26,890
- Our boss...
- ...is a huge fan.

752
00:34:26,934 --> 00:34:28,544
- Makes sense.
- And he's participating

753
00:34:28,588 --> 00:34:32,157
in the biggest tennis match of the season.

754
00:34:32,200 --> 00:34:34,942
And what we want you to do

755
00:34:34,985 --> 00:34:37,945
is be the preshow entertainment.

756
00:34:37,988 --> 00:34:42,080
And what does this "preshow"
entertainment entail?

757
00:34:42,123 --> 00:34:45,953
Before the show, you'll be
entertaining the audience.

758
00:34:45,996 --> 00:34:47,911
As in...

759
00:34:47,955 --> 00:34:51,567
You will be wrestling
volunteers from the audience

760
00:34:51,611 --> 00:34:52,611
for 30 seconds, just...

761
00:34:55,484 --> 00:34:57,007
Bam, bam, bam!

762
00:34:57,051 --> 00:34:58,313
We know a lot about wrestling.

763
00:34:58,357 --> 00:35:01,099
Yeah, no, you don't, but...

764
00:35:01,142 --> 00:35:02,404
Hm.

765
00:35:02,448 --> 00:35:04,363
You know what?

766
00:35:04,406 --> 00:35:05,407
I'll do it.

767
00:35:05,451 --> 00:35:06,843
Nice doing business with you.

768
00:35:06,887 --> 00:35:09,585
- Thank you, ladies.
- Our hotmail is on the card.

769
00:35:09,629 --> 00:35:13,459
So, guys, I'm gonna teach you
the poach today.

770
00:35:13,502 --> 00:35:15,504
Does anybody know what the poach is?

771
00:35:15,548 --> 00:35:16,810
- No.
- No one?

772
00:35:16,853 --> 00:35:19,900
- The egg.
- There's a poached egg.

773
00:35:19,943 --> 00:35:23,077
Has anybody ever poached a whale

774
00:35:23,121 --> 00:35:25,340
off the coast of Madagascar?

775
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:28,300
- No.
- Well, I have, okay?

776
00:35:28,343 --> 00:35:29,779
Let's keep that between us.

777
00:35:29,823 --> 00:35:31,651
Okay, John, you're gonna start.

778
00:35:31,694 --> 00:35:32,956
This is the poach.

779
00:35:36,046 --> 00:35:37,265
Boom!

780
00:35:37,309 --> 00:35:38,832
Did you see that?

781
00:35:38,875 --> 00:35:40,084
You guys think you can do that?

782
00:35:40,094 --> 00:35:41,617
- Yeah.
- Okay, Friday,

783
00:35:41,661 --> 00:35:43,315
when we play this match against Ramsey,

784
00:35:43,358 --> 00:35:45,273
they're not gonna be expecting it.

785
00:35:45,317 --> 00:35:48,320
Okay? Rackets up, get excited.

786
00:35:48,363 --> 00:35:50,017
You're gonna want to aim right there.

787
00:35:50,060 --> 00:35:51,584
See Knox's belly?

788
00:35:51,627 --> 00:35:54,021
Just right in the center, okay?

789
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,501
Come on.

790
00:35:56,937 --> 00:35:58,373
Yes! Yes.

791
00:35:58,417 --> 00:36:01,985
When she becomes the cougar,
you become the leopard.

792
00:36:02,029 --> 00:36:03,422
Right? Cougar, leopard.

793
00:36:03,465 --> 00:36:05,946
Now go get it, go get it.

794
00:36:05,989 --> 00:36:07,165
Whoa! What the...

795
00:36:07,208 --> 00:36:08,688
- Did you see that angle?
- Yeah.

796
00:36:08,731 --> 00:36:10,646
Oh my gosh! Right here.

797
00:36:10,690 --> 00:36:12,648
All right, bring it in,
right here, bring it in.

798
00:36:12,692 --> 00:36:14,520
Let's go, let's go.

799
00:36:14,563 --> 00:36:16,913
Who... who are we gonna celebrate today?

800
00:36:16,957 --> 00:36:18,306
- Me?
- Kaylee.

801
00:36:18,350 --> 00:36:20,395
On three, "Kaylee."

802
00:36:20,439 --> 00:36:23,572
One, two, three, Kaylee!

803
00:36:26,488 --> 00:36:28,621
- Hi.
- Hi.

804
00:36:44,289 --> 00:36:45,497
Is there anything in particular

805
00:36:45,507 --> 00:36:46,900
you're looking for?

806
00:36:46,943 --> 00:36:51,774
Well, primarily rackets and some balls

807
00:36:51,818 --> 00:36:54,168
and maybe some snacks.

808
00:36:54,212 --> 00:36:57,345
So, just like that, yeah.

809
00:36:57,389 --> 00:36:59,739
Ooh, oats and honey.

810
00:36:59,782 --> 00:37:01,871
Yeah, I'll take all these.

811
00:37:01,915 --> 00:37:04,961
- What do these do?
- Uh, those go over the grip.

812
00:37:05,005 --> 00:37:07,181
Yeah, I'll need five of these.

813
00:37:07,225 --> 00:37:08,835
I'll take this.

814
00:37:08,878 --> 00:37:10,532
Basket of balls, all right.

815
00:37:12,926 --> 00:37:14,275
- Okay.
- And...

816
00:37:16,277 --> 00:37:18,932
Cool, uh...

817
00:37:18,975 --> 00:37:20,803
You know, I have a girlfriend.

818
00:37:20,847 --> 00:37:22,283
- You do?
- Mm-hm.

819
00:37:22,327 --> 00:37:23,589
- Well, good.
- Yeah.

820
00:37:23,632 --> 00:37:25,243
Glad to hear that.

821
00:37:27,245 --> 00:37:30,639
Do you, uh, do you have any advice for me?

822
00:37:30,683 --> 00:37:33,947
Well, women really like to be listened to.

823
00:37:33,990 --> 00:37:36,906
Do you have any other advice
besides listening?

824
00:37:36,950 --> 00:37:38,681
'Cause it's hard for me
to do that sometimes.

825
00:37:38,691 --> 00:37:40,997
Do you have a sense of humor?

826
00:37:41,041 --> 00:37:43,478
- Women like sense of humor.
- Okay.

827
00:37:43,522 --> 00:37:45,306
- What's your name?
- Wendy.

828
00:37:45,350 --> 00:37:47,308
I'm Delta. Delta Thompson.

829
00:37:47,352 --> 00:37:49,267
- Knock-knock.
- Who's there?

830
00:37:49,310 --> 00:37:50,964
- Interrupting cow.
- Interrupting...

831
00:37:51,007 --> 00:37:53,314
Moo!

832
00:37:58,276 --> 00:38:01,104
- Hey!
- Hey! How's it going?

833
00:38:01,148 --> 00:38:02,454
Oh.

834
00:38:02,497 --> 00:38:03,923
- Nice to see you again.
- Good to see you.

835
00:38:03,933 --> 00:38:07,372
Um, I thought maybe we could
just hit some balls.

836
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:09,635
- Yeah, that sounds good.
- And I got some snacks.

837
00:38:09,678 --> 00:38:11,985
- Oh, awesome.
- Oats and honey,

838
00:38:12,028 --> 00:38:13,682
and these are some baked fish.

839
00:38:13,726 --> 00:38:15,771
- Thanks.
- Yeah. Let's head this way.

840
00:38:15,815 --> 00:38:17,295
Let's... let's go.

841
00:38:17,338 --> 00:38:19,558
Yeah, I hard-boiled an egg this morning.

842
00:38:19,601 --> 00:38:21,255
Oh, wow, was that your first time?

843
00:38:21,299 --> 00:38:23,126
No, I do that every morning.

844
00:38:23,170 --> 00:38:25,390
Typically, I try and do
a soft boil or a medium boil.

845
00:38:25,433 --> 00:38:28,218
I can never get the soft boil right.

846
00:38:28,262 --> 00:38:30,090
- One.
- Two.

847
00:38:31,352 --> 00:38:32,962
Sorry, that was a little high.

848
00:38:35,965 --> 00:38:38,707
Three. Sugar!

849
00:38:38,751 --> 00:38:40,448
- Okay.
- One.

850
00:38:40,492 --> 00:38:42,363
Two.

851
00:38:42,407 --> 00:38:45,148
- Three.
- Four.

852
00:38:45,192 --> 00:38:48,369
Oh, we almost had five!

853
00:38:48,413 --> 00:38:50,153
Hey, you did pretty good out there.

854
00:38:50,197 --> 00:38:52,808
Thanks. You weren't
too bad, though.

855
00:38:52,852 --> 00:38:54,375
Oh.

856
00:38:55,811 --> 00:38:57,422
You might want to get a lesson, though.

857
00:38:57,465 --> 00:38:59,598
It wouldn't hurt.

858
00:38:59,641 --> 00:39:02,949
Yeah. Yeah, that's a good idea.

859
00:39:07,388 --> 00:39:09,129
Knock knock.

860
00:39:11,523 --> 00:39:14,917
Ellis, Emily, welcome.

861
00:39:14,961 --> 00:39:16,310
Glad you're here.

862
00:39:16,354 --> 00:39:17,877
Well, how'd you guys meet?

863
00:39:17,920 --> 00:39:20,227
- Tell me how you met.
- Uh, was it freshman year

864
00:39:20,270 --> 00:39:21,653
- of high school?
- Freshman year of high school,

865
00:39:21,663 --> 00:39:25,406
I'd eaten some really old chicken fingers

866
00:39:25,450 --> 00:39:27,016
- for breakfast, and...
- Yes.

867
00:39:27,060 --> 00:39:29,671
But, we were in line getting food,

868
00:39:29,715 --> 00:39:32,457
and he, instead of puking, like,

869
00:39:32,500 --> 00:39:34,763
on his tray, he leaned over
and puked on mine.

870
00:39:34,807 --> 00:39:37,200
Well, now that's
kind of romantic, a little,

871
00:39:37,244 --> 00:39:38,811
- isn't it?
- Yeah.

872
00:39:38,854 --> 00:39:40,595
- I think so.
- Kinda cute,

873
00:39:40,639 --> 00:39:42,423
- puked on the first date.
- But...

874
00:39:42,467 --> 00:39:44,469
I played it off pretty well, I thought.

875
00:39:44,512 --> 00:39:46,862
Oh, good, well who's got the debt?

876
00:39:46,906 --> 00:39:48,908
Who's got the debt here?

877
00:39:48,951 --> 00:39:50,388
- Sorry, debt?
- Yeah,

878
00:39:50,431 --> 00:39:52,955
every counseling situation I come in,

879
00:39:52,999 --> 00:39:55,654
one of the two has debt,

880
00:39:55,697 --> 00:39:57,960
so who is it?

881
00:39:58,004 --> 00:39:59,517
- I don't have any debt.
- That's good.

882
00:39:59,527 --> 00:40:01,355
- And I don't think you...
- But, what...?

883
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:04,184
Um, I was only talking about,
'cause I have some loans

884
00:40:04,227 --> 00:40:05,794
I took out.

885
00:40:05,838 --> 00:40:07,046
- Just the ones...
- Oh, like, you still have

886
00:40:07,056 --> 00:40:08,841
- those loans?
- I mean, like,

887
00:40:08,884 --> 00:40:11,191
you know, I have the credit
paid for my house,

888
00:40:11,234 --> 00:40:12,888
and, like, car payments.

889
00:40:12,932 --> 00:40:14,097
You're gonna have, like, some debt.

890
00:40:14,107 --> 00:40:15,761
I mean, everyone has debt.

891
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:17,197
- No.
- Right, it's like a...

892
00:40:17,240 --> 00:40:18,493
- It's a fairly com...
- Not everyone.

893
00:40:18,503 --> 00:40:19,798
No, that's a fairly common thing.

894
00:40:19,808 --> 00:40:21,767
- No.
- How much debt is it, Emily?

895
00:40:21,810 --> 00:40:24,334
The number?

896
00:40:24,378 --> 00:40:27,076
- A few thousand.
- A few thousand?

897
00:40:27,120 --> 00:40:29,688
- 50,000.
- $50,000 in debt.

898
00:40:29,731 --> 00:40:33,213
- Okay.
- Oh, God.

899
00:40:33,256 --> 00:40:34,823
All right.

900
00:40:34,867 --> 00:40:37,696
Well, why didn't you tell me
you had that much debt?

901
00:40:37,739 --> 00:40:39,296
- 'Cause that...
- My dad never taught me

902
00:40:39,306 --> 00:40:40,863
how to, like, manage finances,
so I don't know

903
00:40:40,873 --> 00:40:42,821
- what you're expecting.
- Okay, this is something

904
00:40:42,831 --> 00:40:46,008
we've got to work on, obviously.

905
00:40:46,052 --> 00:40:49,011
We can work on it.

906
00:40:49,055 --> 00:40:51,710
So, how do you guys feel about pets?

907
00:40:54,364 --> 00:40:56,758
- Um.
- Do you want them?

908
00:40:56,802 --> 00:40:59,369
Do you like them?

909
00:40:59,413 --> 00:41:01,633
- You first, Ellis.
- Sure, uh,

910
00:41:01,676 --> 00:41:04,984
I like dogs.

911
00:41:05,027 --> 00:41:06,855
- Cats I'm allergic to...
- Yeah, okay.

912
00:41:06,899 --> 00:41:08,727
...and I think they're
really cold and mean.

913
00:41:08,770 --> 00:41:12,078
- Oh, okay.
- That's a little...

914
00:41:12,121 --> 00:41:14,341
Oh, you like cats now, too?

915
00:41:14,384 --> 00:41:15,951
Do you have cat debt?

916
00:41:15,995 --> 00:41:17,649
Do... all the money

917
00:41:17,692 --> 00:41:19,467
- that you pay for cats.
- Yeah, yeah, no, actually I do

918
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:22,001
have cat debt, because I had to get surgery

919
00:41:22,044 --> 00:41:24,351
- for Toby when he had cancer.
- Oh, how'd that work out?

920
00:41:24,394 --> 00:41:26,614
Toby's dead, babe.

921
00:41:26,658 --> 00:41:28,181
Oh, my God.

922
00:41:29,965 --> 00:41:31,619
I'm so glad you're here.

923
00:41:33,360 --> 00:41:36,189
Okay, the wedding's coming up.

924
00:41:36,232 --> 00:41:39,148
We've got details I'd like to hear about.

925
00:41:39,192 --> 00:41:43,892
Bridesmaids, who's walking you
down the aisle?

926
00:41:43,936 --> 00:41:45,807
Um.

927
00:41:45,851 --> 00:41:47,461
Well, I, uh...

928
00:41:47,505 --> 00:41:49,550
- I know who my bridesmaids are.
- Okay.

929
00:41:49,594 --> 00:41:52,553
Who's walking you down the aisle, Emily?

930
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:54,816
Um, I mean, we were
talking about it earlier.

931
00:41:54,860 --> 00:41:58,472
I think I'm probably just gonna
walk myself down the aisle.

932
00:41:58,516 --> 00:42:01,214
Oh, that's so sad.

933
00:42:46,912 --> 00:42:48,827
And you know Jennifer and I kinda have

934
00:42:48,870 --> 00:42:50,655
a little thing going, right?

935
00:42:50,698 --> 00:42:52,570
No, what thing, what kind of thing?

936
00:42:52,613 --> 00:42:54,963
Well, we signed a thing,
we talked to Don, so he said...

937
00:42:55,007 --> 00:42:57,444
No flirting with the coworkers
or customers that come in.

938
00:42:57,487 --> 00:42:59,664
Look, it's just me and Jennifer, Val, okay?

939
00:42:59,707 --> 00:43:01,361
I know you thought we had something,

940
00:43:01,404 --> 00:43:03,058
but it's not there anymore.

941
00:43:03,102 --> 00:43:05,137
I just don't wanna see you
get your heart broken again.

942
00:43:05,147 --> 00:43:07,672
Well, you're the one that
broke my heart, Valerie.

943
00:43:09,412 --> 00:43:10,631
Hey, hey there, Don.

944
00:43:10,675 --> 00:43:12,372
- Yeah?
- You mind if I talk to you

945
00:43:12,415 --> 00:43:14,983
- in your office for a second?
- Come on in.

946
00:43:15,027 --> 00:43:16,637
I'm smitten, I'm a...

947
00:43:16,681 --> 00:43:19,684
I'm a love bug, and I don't know
what to do, Don,

948
00:43:19,727 --> 00:43:22,164
and I'm... I'm about to be squashed here.

949
00:43:22,208 --> 00:43:23,775
What advice do you give?

950
00:43:23,818 --> 00:43:26,691
Start slow, maybe ya ask her to lunch.

951
00:43:26,734 --> 00:43:28,083
- Okay.
- Some place quiet,

952
00:43:28,127 --> 00:43:30,651
and where you can build up a rapport.

953
00:43:30,695 --> 00:43:33,480
Mhm, all right.

954
00:43:33,523 --> 00:43:37,179
And Don, what is 0 APR?

955
00:43:41,619 --> 00:43:43,925
Oh, look at that.

956
00:43:57,504 --> 00:43:59,235
- Let's go, y'all.
- Faith, you wanna, uh...?

957
00:43:59,245 --> 00:44:00,410
- You wanna break into groups?
- Yeah.

958
00:44:00,420 --> 00:44:02,683
- Okay.
- You gotta work.

959
00:44:02,727 --> 00:44:06,034
- What is this?
- Kay, Butch, um, so,

960
00:44:06,078 --> 00:44:07,809
we know that your match
is coming up pretty soon,

961
00:44:07,819 --> 00:44:10,212
and we wanna help you,
because you've been helping us

962
00:44:10,256 --> 00:44:13,433
for the last couple years now,
and we wanna train with you

963
00:44:13,476 --> 00:44:16,436
- to help you get your home.
- You wanna train with me?

964
00:44:16,479 --> 00:44:18,743
- Yeah.
- Okay.

965
00:44:18,786 --> 00:44:20,092
Go!

966
00:44:22,094 --> 00:44:23,965
Oh, yeah, come on, you got it.

967
00:44:24,009 --> 00:44:25,924
Come on, y'all.

968
00:44:27,969 --> 00:44:30,319
Keep 'em up, don't touch the ground.

969
00:44:32,495 --> 00:44:35,542
Ooh, John, you throwing up?

970
00:44:35,585 --> 00:44:36,717
Yeah?

971
00:44:36,761 --> 00:44:40,373
10, 9, 8...

972
00:44:40,416 --> 00:44:42,592
- 3, 4...
- Ugh!

973
00:44:42,636 --> 00:44:45,030
There ya go... 5...

974
00:44:45,073 --> 00:44:48,294
Come on, other way, Faith, come on.

975
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:49,774
You got it.

976
00:44:49,817 --> 00:44:51,079
Got it.

977
00:44:51,123 --> 00:44:52,951
Come on, guys, come on!

978
00:44:56,650 --> 00:44:59,348
Yeah, this is, uh... this is
one of my favorite models,

979
00:44:59,392 --> 00:45:01,873
and it's actually

980
00:45:01,916 --> 00:45:03,962
incredibly

981
00:45:04,005 --> 00:45:08,488
huge for what we call a tiny home.

982
00:45:11,404 --> 00:45:13,101
Hey, Ray, uh,

983
00:45:13,145 --> 00:45:15,016
- we got any sales today?
- No.

984
00:45:15,060 --> 00:45:16,539
- No?
- No.

985
00:45:16,583 --> 00:45:18,193
All right.

986
00:45:18,237 --> 00:45:20,848
Yes, uh, it's a walk-in closet,
really, if you walk in and...

987
00:45:20,892 --> 00:45:24,199
- Oh, cool.
- Yeah, and I can close you in.

988
00:45:24,243 --> 00:45:26,288
It's almost like a third bedroom,

989
00:45:26,332 --> 00:45:28,247
if you want.

990
00:45:28,290 --> 00:45:30,640
- Hey, Valerie, how's it going?
- Hey, good, how are you?

991
00:45:30,684 --> 00:45:32,642
- Good, all right, see ya.
- Good.

992
00:45:34,340 --> 00:45:37,473
I said it'd be a bit small for a bedroom.

993
00:45:37,517 --> 00:45:39,780
Absolutely, it'd be a great bedroom.

994
00:45:39,824 --> 00:45:41,434
We get any sales today?

995
00:45:41,477 --> 00:45:43,784
No, not... not that I'm aware of.

996
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:46,918
Well, this is our...
this is our toilet, and...

997
00:45:46,961 --> 00:45:49,529
- It says don't use it.
- Yeah, some local teenagers

998
00:45:49,572 --> 00:45:51,966
come often in there to take dookies,

999
00:45:52,010 --> 00:45:55,013
but we try to prevent that by...

1000
00:45:55,056 --> 00:45:56,579
- Oh.
- Yeah, see,

1001
00:45:56,623 --> 00:45:58,581
- so that was that smell.
- Yeah.

1002
00:45:58,625 --> 00:46:00,801
You... so you don't want a tiny house?

1003
00:46:00,845 --> 00:46:04,631
No, no, no, I... I have a really big house.

1004
00:46:27,915 --> 00:46:29,874
Delta? Mike Clark.

1005
00:46:29,917 --> 00:46:32,006
- Nice to meet you, sir.
- What do you got there?

1006
00:46:32,050 --> 00:46:34,443
It's a candy bar.

1007
00:46:34,487 --> 00:46:37,620
Winners don't eat candy.

1008
00:46:37,664 --> 00:46:39,274
- Yes, sir.
- Let's go.

1009
00:46:41,059 --> 00:46:43,670
Delta, the most important thing
is consistency.

1010
00:46:43,713 --> 00:46:45,019
- Okay.
- Making the other guy

1011
00:46:45,063 --> 00:46:46,586
have to hit one more ball.

1012
00:46:53,201 --> 00:46:54,855
- What was that?
- I don't know,

1013
00:46:54,899 --> 00:46:56,465
you hit it harder.

1014
00:46:58,032 --> 00:47:00,382
Try to see the ball hit the strings, Delta.

1015
00:47:05,387 --> 00:47:08,042
Delta, you sure you're right handed?

1016
00:47:08,086 --> 00:47:09,827
All right, good job.

1017
00:47:09,870 --> 00:47:11,270
But, you wanna try to hit the ball.

1018
00:47:11,306 --> 00:47:12,568
- Oh, okay.
- Okay?

1019
00:47:14,222 --> 00:47:16,040
All right, let me show,
let me show you something.

1020
00:47:16,050 --> 00:47:18,748
Backstretch, toss, and then swing.

1021
00:47:18,792 --> 00:47:20,262
- Great.
- Like you're throwing a ball.

1022
00:47:20,272 --> 00:47:22,143
- Yeah.
- But, get that racket back there

1023
00:47:22,187 --> 00:47:23,797
like you're scratching your back.

1024
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:26,321
I have a back scratcher, uh, back home

1025
00:47:26,365 --> 00:47:28,541
that's, uh... it's in the shape of a hand.

1026
00:47:28,584 --> 00:47:30,412
Oh, okay, well, good for you.

1027
00:47:30,456 --> 00:47:31,926
Why don't we use the racket
out here, though?

1028
00:47:31,936 --> 00:47:34,329
- Okay.
- That's it.

1029
00:47:34,373 --> 00:47:36,636
Nice, that's it.

1030
00:47:36,679 --> 00:47:39,291
- Great serve.
- There we go, I did it.

1031
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:42,033
Maybe... maybe now we could go grab a beer.

1032
00:47:42,076 --> 00:47:43,328
No, let's just get this over with.

1033
00:47:43,338 --> 00:47:44,731
Okay.

1034
00:47:46,167 --> 00:47:48,866
Thank you so much, Mike.

1035
00:47:48,909 --> 00:47:50,955
Any last advice?

1036
00:47:50,998 --> 00:47:53,305
Yeah, well,

1037
00:47:53,348 --> 00:47:55,263
you're not very good.

1038
00:47:55,307 --> 00:47:58,397
You might wanna consider
changing it to a doubles match.

1039
00:48:05,143 --> 00:48:06,927
There's just like an air of death

1040
00:48:06,971 --> 00:48:10,148
over the apartment right now,
'cause I think Marcus's ferret

1041
00:48:10,191 --> 00:48:12,672
got in the walls and died,

1042
00:48:12,715 --> 00:48:15,544
and it smells so bad that I threw up

1043
00:48:15,588 --> 00:48:17,720
in my sleep last night,
I'm not even joking.

1044
00:48:17,764 --> 00:48:20,027
- Baby, that's not good.
- Is that normal?

1045
00:48:20,071 --> 00:48:21,768
- No.
- I just...

1046
00:48:21,811 --> 00:48:23,813
I just wanna live with you so bad.

1047
00:48:23,857 --> 00:48:25,815
I... I don't wanna live in

1048
00:48:25,859 --> 00:48:28,079
a smelly, haunted apartment anymore.

1049
00:48:28,122 --> 00:48:29,907
Okay, well we have like a week

1050
00:48:29,950 --> 00:48:32,344
until we get married,
so maybe we can make it.

1051
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:38,480
Boys, woo!

1052
00:48:38,524 --> 00:48:40,439
- All right.
- Big paintball game today?

1053
00:48:40,482 --> 00:48:42,920
It's a scrimmage, but yeah, still big.

1054
00:48:42,963 --> 00:48:44,573
- All right, be good.
- Later!

1055
00:48:53,278 --> 00:48:55,454
Okay, listen, Jack, Kailey,

1056
00:48:55,497 --> 00:48:57,499
you guys are gonna start us off, okay?

1057
00:48:57,543 --> 00:48:59,414
Knox, Faith, you're gonna close it down.

1058
00:48:59,458 --> 00:49:00,981
- All right, we ready?
- Yeah.

1059
00:49:01,025 --> 00:49:03,418
Okay, one, two, three, go for it!

1060
00:49:03,462 --> 00:49:06,117
All right, let's go, Jack, Kailey, come on.

1061
00:49:06,160 --> 00:49:07,988
- Go, guys! Kailey!
- Let's go, let's go.

1062
00:49:08,032 --> 00:49:10,208
- Go!
- Yeah!

1063
00:49:10,251 --> 00:49:12,601
Come on, Jack, come on!

1064
00:49:12,645 --> 00:49:14,647
What was this?

1065
00:49:14,690 --> 00:49:16,605
That... I didn't teach you that.

1066
00:49:16,649 --> 00:49:18,259
Come on, Jack, you got this!

1067
00:49:18,303 --> 00:49:20,522
Woo!

1068
00:49:20,566 --> 00:49:22,133
Jack, yeah!

1069
00:49:22,176 --> 00:49:24,265
- Yeah!
- Yes, yes!

1070
00:49:24,309 --> 00:49:25,701
First point of the day.

1071
00:49:25,745 --> 00:49:28,095
Yeah, Kailey!

1072
00:49:28,139 --> 00:49:30,054
Hold on a second, guys.

1073
00:49:30,097 --> 00:49:32,317
Okay, doing what we worked on.

1074
00:49:32,360 --> 00:49:34,754
All right a little softer, yeah?

1075
00:49:34,797 --> 00:49:37,626
Okay, and just cross court over the net.

1076
00:49:39,715 --> 00:49:42,631
- A little higher.
- Woo, come on, Kail.

1077
00:49:42,675 --> 00:49:43,893
I just want you to relax.

1078
00:49:47,810 --> 00:49:49,421
Okay, listen.

1079
00:49:49,464 --> 00:49:52,380
Okay, I think you're
thinking about it too much.

1080
00:49:52,424 --> 00:49:53,991
- Why are we here?
- To have fun.

1081
00:49:54,034 --> 00:49:55,253
To have fun.

1082
00:49:55,296 --> 00:49:56,863
Proud of you, you're gonna get it.

1083
00:49:56,906 --> 00:49:58,821
Let's go, right here,
okay, here we go, Kailey.

1084
00:49:58,865 --> 00:50:00,606
- Come on.
- Come on, Kailey!

1085
00:50:00,649 --> 00:50:02,434
- You can do this!
- Yeah!

1086
00:50:05,959 --> 00:50:07,439
Way to go!

1087
00:50:07,482 --> 00:50:09,006
Whoa, yeah!

1088
00:50:09,049 --> 00:50:10,485
Awesome, you guys.

1089
00:50:10,529 --> 00:50:12,139
- Kailey, you did it!
- Yeah.

1090
00:50:12,183 --> 00:50:14,011
Yes!

1091
00:50:16,404 --> 00:50:17,840
I got ball.

1092
00:50:19,364 --> 00:50:20,582
Totes, yes!

1093
00:50:20,626 --> 00:50:22,236
Way to go!

1094
00:50:22,280 --> 00:50:25,631
It's the poach off the coast
of Madagascar, is what that is.

1095
00:50:25,674 --> 00:50:27,763
Boom, boom.

1096
00:50:29,678 --> 00:50:31,680
- It's all right.
- Keep your eye on the ball.

1097
00:50:33,639 --> 00:50:34,988
- Hey.
- Oh.

1098
00:50:35,032 --> 00:50:38,122
Come on, Knox, please, please, God.

1099
00:50:41,081 --> 00:50:43,736
Hey, whoa, Knox, no.

1100
00:50:43,779 --> 00:50:46,391
No, don't you get my court wet.

1101
00:50:46,434 --> 00:50:47,653
Don't.

1102
00:50:47,696 --> 00:50:49,176
Hey, bud, hey, just take a break,

1103
00:50:49,220 --> 00:50:51,342
take a break, you can come back,
come on, take a break.

1104
00:50:51,352 --> 00:50:53,789
Go, John, come on, John, fill in.

1105
00:50:53,833 --> 00:50:55,574
Hey, you're okay.

1106
00:50:55,617 --> 00:50:57,097
You almost got one in.

1107
00:50:57,141 --> 00:50:59,186
No crying, you didn't cry.

1108
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,667
Who's got a ball?

1109
00:51:03,495 --> 00:51:05,627
We got destroyed today,

1110
00:51:05,671 --> 00:51:07,629
but you know what?

1111
00:51:07,673 --> 00:51:10,110
Somebody got a serve in for the first time.

1112
00:51:10,154 --> 00:51:12,460
Kailey.

1113
00:51:12,504 --> 00:51:15,463
Faith got a poach, how about that?

1114
00:51:15,507 --> 00:51:18,684
You just learned that this week.

1115
00:51:18,727 --> 00:51:22,122
Knox almost cried.

1116
00:51:22,166 --> 00:51:24,603
But, he didn't.

1117
00:51:24,646 --> 00:51:27,693
Jack, Kailey,

1118
00:51:27,736 --> 00:51:29,695
I think there's something there.

1119
00:51:29,738 --> 00:51:31,740
- Mm, mhm.
- Yeah?

1120
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:33,829
You listen here, Jack.

1121
00:51:33,873 --> 00:51:35,570
You better guard her heart.

1122
00:51:37,137 --> 00:51:39,052
And I someone out there expressing himself.

1123
00:51:39,096 --> 00:51:40,619
John, how do you feel?

1124
00:51:40,662 --> 00:51:42,882
Feel like I had good, you know,

1125
00:51:42,925 --> 00:51:44,797
eye contact with the ball and all that,

1126
00:51:44,840 --> 00:51:47,321
but, um, I don't know,
I feel like I could've

1127
00:51:47,365 --> 00:51:49,541
expressed myself more.

1128
00:51:49,584 --> 00:51:50,890
Well, guess what?

1129
00:51:50,933 --> 00:51:52,370
It's never too late.

1130
00:51:52,413 --> 00:51:54,154
John, close this out.

1131
00:51:54,198 --> 00:51:55,678
- Can I get a beat, please?
- Come on.

1132
00:52:03,946 --> 00:52:07,254
- Call this one "The Pancake."
- Oh, oh.

1133
00:52:07,298 --> 00:52:10,039
Oh, oh, oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1134
00:52:28,319 --> 00:52:31,148
This is our Colorado D unit,
it's one of my favorite units.

1135
00:52:31,191 --> 00:52:32,758
Oh, the Colorado, I like that.

1136
00:52:32,801 --> 00:52:35,326
Yeah, it's Colorado
because in Colorado they have

1137
00:52:35,369 --> 00:52:37,806
a lot of trees,
and this is completely made out

1138
00:52:37,850 --> 00:52:39,286
- a lot of wood.
- I like the...

1139
00:52:39,330 --> 00:52:41,114
I like the pine and the lighter floor

1140
00:52:41,158 --> 00:52:43,464
that kinda gives it
more of an open feeling.

1141
00:52:43,508 --> 00:52:46,554
- Sure, yeah.
- Now, is this Formica, or, um...?

1142
00:52:46,598 --> 00:52:48,513
Uh, I don't know who it's for.

1143
00:52:48,556 --> 00:52:50,471
But, I'm not sure,
I don't know who Mica is.

1144
00:52:50,515 --> 00:52:52,778
- And this bathroom?
- The teenagers often come in

1145
00:52:52,821 --> 00:52:55,955
and take dookies at night,
but we try and prevent that,

1146
00:52:55,998 --> 00:52:58,087
and we'll get you a clean one before.

1147
00:52:58,131 --> 00:53:00,133
Have they... but not in this one, right?

1148
00:53:00,177 --> 00:53:01,526
Like, they... teenagers don't...

1149
00:53:01,569 --> 00:53:03,267
You know, I actually can't even remember.

1150
00:53:03,310 --> 00:53:04,606
This, everything, the stain of wood,

1151
00:53:04,616 --> 00:53:06,748
the size, has everything we're looking for.

1152
00:53:06,792 --> 00:53:09,795
Good, but you don't want it?

1153
00:53:09,838 --> 00:53:11,579
No, I mean, we'll take it.

1154
00:53:11,623 --> 00:53:13,538
- We'll take this.
- Real... uh, really?

1155
00:53:13,581 --> 00:53:15,714
- Yeah.
- Yes, yes!

1156
00:53:15,757 --> 00:53:17,803
You can have it, it's yours.

1157
00:53:17,846 --> 00:53:20,240
- Yes, yes.
- Thank you.

1158
00:53:20,284 --> 00:53:21,850
Pleasure doing business.

1159
00:53:21,894 --> 00:53:23,983
- You... yeah.
- Hot dog.

1160
00:53:24,026 --> 00:53:25,419
Yes!

1161
00:53:48,703 --> 00:53:50,879
- Come on in, come on in.
- Yeah, okay, cool.

1162
00:53:50,923 --> 00:53:52,272
- Awesome.
- Yeah.

1163
00:53:52,316 --> 00:53:53,969
Man.

1164
00:53:54,013 --> 00:53:56,929
So, first just, like,
take a feel of the home, like,

1165
00:53:56,972 --> 00:53:58,626
kind of reach out, feel the air.

1166
00:53:58,670 --> 00:54:00,715
- Do you feel it?
- Yeah, real something.

1167
00:54:00,759 --> 00:54:02,282
This is good.

1168
00:54:02,326 --> 00:54:04,197
This is our farm basin sink.

1169
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:07,374
You got two sides, no disposal,
but there is room.

1170
00:54:07,418 --> 00:54:09,115
- Full oven.
- Full oven

1171
00:54:09,158 --> 00:54:11,020
- for all of the cookies you...
- Oh, my God, it's got two racks.

1172
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:14,120
Yeah, also, don't forget
to look at this microwave.

1173
00:54:14,163 --> 00:54:15,687
- Two racks!
- Make sure you remove

1174
00:54:15,730 --> 00:54:18,516
- the papers.
- Golly, Ma.

1175
00:54:18,559 --> 00:54:20,474
It's better than your microwave.

1176
00:54:20,518 --> 00:54:21,726
What is this... this the bathroom?

1177
00:54:21,736 --> 00:54:23,434
Yeah, come on in, follow me in.

1178
00:54:23,477 --> 00:54:25,958
This is awesome.

1179
00:54:26,001 --> 00:54:27,307
Wow.

1180
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:28,874
This is great, ladies.

1181
00:54:28,917 --> 00:54:30,735
- What else you got?
- Well, we got the Dryclone.

1182
00:54:30,745 --> 00:54:32,443
Mom, these are like yours at home.

1183
00:54:32,486 --> 00:54:35,228
Yeah, guess Mom won't be
doing your laundry anymore.

1184
00:54:35,272 --> 00:54:37,099
Nah, she'll come over and help me.

1185
00:54:37,143 --> 00:54:39,058
- All this room.
- No way.

1186
00:54:39,101 --> 00:54:41,887
- Yes, if you have a baby.
- My gosh, Kelly.

1187
00:54:41,930 --> 00:54:44,585
Right here, you can store it right there.

1188
00:54:44,629 --> 00:54:46,935
It's kind of like a ladder, which adds a...

1189
00:54:46,979 --> 00:54:49,024
- Whoa!
- ...a key of... ow!

1190
00:54:49,068 --> 00:54:51,113
Ow, oh, uh, watch your head.

1191
00:54:51,157 --> 00:54:52,767
- Well?
- I'll take it.

1192
00:54:52,811 --> 00:54:55,770
- I'm gonna win this thing and...
- That's what we wanna hear.

1193
00:54:55,814 --> 00:54:57,772
I think I got a good shot at Delta.

1194
00:54:57,816 --> 00:55:00,035
Yeah, I mean, now that it's doubles,

1195
00:55:00,079 --> 00:55:02,211
like, I think it'll be even more fun

1196
00:55:02,255 --> 00:55:05,302
and more publicity
will come to the both of us.

1197
00:55:05,345 --> 00:55:07,598
- Did you say "doubles"?
- Yeah, you need to find a buddy.

1198
00:55:07,608 --> 00:55:09,470
It's kind of like, you see,
we're working better

1199
00:55:09,480 --> 00:55:12,221
- as a team.
- So, no... okay, whoa, whoa, whoa.

1200
00:55:12,265 --> 00:55:14,180
So, Delta and I are not playing?

1201
00:55:14,223 --> 00:55:15,703
- Oh, oh, no, no, no.
- Singles?

1202
00:55:15,747 --> 00:55:17,391
You will be playing,
just with two other people

1203
00:55:17,401 --> 00:55:18,783
also on the court at the same time.

1204
00:55:18,793 --> 00:55:20,752
So, I gotta find a partner by tomorrow?

1205
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:23,624
- Delta's got one, so you should.
- Yes.

1206
00:55:23,668 --> 00:55:25,974
Dang it!

1207
00:55:26,018 --> 00:55:28,107
Um.

1208
00:55:28,150 --> 00:55:31,110
Uh, Jennifer let's show her
the linoleum options.

1209
00:55:31,153 --> 00:55:32,677
Crawl on over.

1210
00:55:32,720 --> 00:55:35,636
- Follow us.
- Just right down stairs.

1211
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,204
I'll be down there in a minute, Mom.

1212
00:55:40,424 --> 00:55:43,209
God.

1213
00:55:43,252 --> 00:55:44,776
Gotta buy this home.

1214
00:55:48,823 --> 00:55:51,217
I'm content where I am, I'm happy,

1215
00:55:51,260 --> 00:55:53,306
but I know if I can win this home,

1216
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,526
man, it'll make things better.

1217
00:56:01,445 --> 00:56:04,273
Look, just give me a minute, okay?

1218
00:56:04,317 --> 00:56:06,972
Delta changed the rules
from singles to doubles,

1219
00:56:07,015 --> 00:56:08,930
and I need a doubles partner,

1220
00:56:08,974 --> 00:56:11,759
so please, will you be my doubles partner?

1221
00:56:11,803 --> 00:56:13,761
- No.
- No?

1222
00:56:13,805 --> 00:56:15,850
Dad, I haven't played tennis
in like nine years.

1223
00:56:15,894 --> 00:56:17,504
Uh, like that matters.

1224
00:56:17,548 --> 00:56:19,941
Come on, you can pick it up.

1225
00:56:19,985 --> 00:56:23,118
Please, this is hard for me
to come here and ask.

1226
00:56:23,162 --> 00:56:25,860
Look, I'm sorry,
it's just not gonna happen.

1227
00:56:25,904 --> 00:56:29,342
But, I'm glad you're doing this,

1228
00:56:29,386 --> 00:56:32,693
but I can't, I'm sorry.

1229
00:56:32,737 --> 00:56:34,695
- You're serious?
- Yeah.

1230
00:56:34,739 --> 00:56:36,175
I'm serious.

1231
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:41,300
- Good to see you, Ellis.
- Always a pleasure, sir.

1232
00:56:41,310 --> 00:56:42,964
- All right, take care.
- Yeah.

1233
00:56:52,321 --> 00:56:54,672
Looks like you're
my doubles partner, Gordy.

1234
00:56:57,544 --> 00:57:00,547
Yes.

1235
00:57:00,591 --> 00:57:02,365
Let's see how many
we can get in a row... one.

1236
00:57:02,375 --> 00:57:03,811
Count yours out.

1237
00:57:03,855 --> 00:57:05,509
I'm at zero, all right, one.

1238
00:57:05,552 --> 00:57:07,162
- Two.
- I got one.

1239
00:57:07,206 --> 00:57:08,512
- Two.
- All right,

1240
00:57:08,555 --> 00:57:10,644
work on your back hand side, see this?

1241
00:57:10,688 --> 00:57:13,342
Doubles, we're gonna have
a lot of volleying tomorrow.

1242
00:57:13,386 --> 00:57:16,345
Five, six... I'm beating you.

1243
00:57:16,389 --> 00:57:17,695
- One.
- Seven.

1244
00:57:19,697 --> 00:57:20,915
That's it, that's it.

1245
00:57:20,959 --> 00:57:22,700
Hey, we may win a point.

1246
00:57:22,743 --> 00:57:25,180
All right, 10 in a row, come on, Gordy.

1247
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:27,269
We can't leave till we get 10.

1248
00:57:27,313 --> 00:57:30,925
One, two,

1249
00:57:30,969 --> 00:57:32,318
three... good.

1250
00:57:32,361 --> 00:57:34,146
Four... play it.

1251
00:57:34,189 --> 00:57:35,887
Oh, well start again.

1252
00:57:35,930 --> 00:57:38,019
Okay, 10 in a row,
trying to be positive here.

1253
00:57:38,063 --> 00:57:40,021
- Here we go... one.
- Okay.

1254
00:57:40,065 --> 00:57:41,501
Oh, almost!

1255
00:57:41,545 --> 00:57:43,068
You know what, five in a row.

1256
00:57:43,111 --> 00:57:44,320
- Five in a row, okay.
- How about five in a row?

1257
00:57:44,330 --> 00:57:46,245
Here we go... one,

1258
00:57:46,288 --> 00:57:48,116
two.

1259
00:57:48,160 --> 00:57:49,988
- Sorry.
- Uh-uh.

1260
00:57:50,031 --> 00:57:51,206
- Sorry.
- Hey, Gordy,

1261
00:57:51,250 --> 00:57:53,470
come here real quick.

1262
00:57:53,513 --> 00:57:55,515
You're not doing bad,

1263
00:57:55,559 --> 00:57:57,778
but I think it's important
you know something.

1264
00:57:57,822 --> 00:57:59,519
- What's that?
- Okay,

1265
00:57:59,563 --> 00:58:01,826
- you know I live with my mom.
- Uh-huh.

1266
00:58:01,869 --> 00:58:04,829
- She's kicking me out.
- Why?

1267
00:58:04,872 --> 00:58:07,962
I don't know, menopause probably.

1268
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,269
So, if we don't win tomorrow,

1269
00:58:10,312 --> 00:58:12,053
I don't have a home.

1270
00:58:12,097 --> 00:58:15,100
I need you to step it up
on the game here, okay?

1271
00:58:15,143 --> 00:58:17,494
- You're all I got here.
- Yeah, yeah.

1272
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:19,234
- Right?
- I can do it.

1273
00:58:19,278 --> 00:58:21,541
Here we go.

1274
00:58:21,585 --> 00:58:22,890
That's it.

1275
00:58:22,934 --> 00:58:24,152
Come on, buddy.

1276
00:58:24,196 --> 00:58:25,676
There you go, come on.

1277
00:58:25,719 --> 00:58:27,416
Come on, Gordy.

1278
00:58:27,460 --> 00:58:29,331
Come on, recover.

1279
00:58:29,375 --> 00:58:32,378
Recover, recover.

1280
00:58:32,421 --> 00:58:35,903
Recover, recover, recover.

1281
00:58:35,947 --> 00:58:39,254
Gordy, God, Gordy.

1282
00:58:43,955 --> 00:58:45,652
Let's pick 'em up.

1283
00:58:55,532 --> 00:58:59,144
Think we got a chance tomorrow, Gordy?

1284
00:58:59,187 --> 00:59:01,886
Yeah, we always have a chance, Butch.

1285
00:59:04,758 --> 00:59:07,065
Always got a chance.

1286
00:59:09,807 --> 00:59:12,331
I just love looking at old pictures.

1287
00:59:12,374 --> 00:59:15,769
This is one of your dad,
I think he was about 8 or 9,

1288
00:59:15,813 --> 00:59:17,641
- and look at all that hair.
- Oh, my God.

1289
00:59:17,684 --> 00:59:20,078
I know, gosh, he had more than me.

1290
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:22,646
And here's another one, we did...
we never cut his hair.

1291
00:59:22,689 --> 00:59:24,822
- Yeah, well...
- We just let it grow.

1292
00:59:24,865 --> 00:59:26,258
He rocked the chili bowl.

1293
00:59:28,086 --> 00:59:31,263
Now, Ms. Ems, let's look at you.

1294
00:59:31,306 --> 00:59:32,786
- Look.
- Drill team.

1295
00:59:32,830 --> 00:59:35,441
- Love it.
- Oh, I miss being a cowgirl.

1296
00:59:35,484 --> 00:59:38,270
I loved watching you, I loved watching you.

1297
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,228
Look at this one, look at this one.

1298
00:59:40,272 --> 00:59:43,014
- It's so beautiful, I love it.
- Oh, my gosh.

1299
00:59:43,057 --> 00:59:46,278
Where did you even get a dress
from, like, the 1890s?

1300
00:59:46,321 --> 00:59:48,672
Well, actually your dad picked that out

1301
00:59:48,715 --> 00:59:50,804
- and bought it for you.
- He's always had

1302
00:59:50,848 --> 00:59:52,545
really good taste, I guess.

1303
00:59:52,589 --> 00:59:55,592
And this is one I found
in the attic the other day.

1304
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:57,855
I'd forgotten I even had it.

1305
00:59:57,898 --> 00:59:59,596
Oh, my gosh, with his tennis rackets.

1306
00:59:59,639 --> 01:00:01,989
Tennis rackets and tennis shoes.

1307
01:00:02,033 --> 01:00:03,904
Grandma, you set him up for this.

1308
01:00:03,948 --> 01:00:07,038
Oh, I love it.

1309
01:00:07,081 --> 01:00:09,344
I think Ellis looks like your dad.

1310
01:00:09,388 --> 01:00:12,391
- Oh, God.
- June Cooper, Channel 5 News.

1311
01:00:12,434 --> 01:00:14,567
We are here live
at the Caswell Tennis Center

1312
01:00:14,611 --> 01:00:16,525
for the game to beat all games.

1313
01:00:16,569 --> 01:00:19,050
The clash of the local titans.

1314
01:00:19,093 --> 01:00:20,791
Delta Thompson and Butcher Duke

1315
01:00:20,834 --> 01:00:22,923
are finally going to battle it out

1316
01:00:22,967 --> 01:00:26,361
for a 20 year grudge over tennis.

1317
01:00:26,405 --> 01:00:28,745
Do you think that Butcher is
prepared for it this go around?

1318
01:00:28,755 --> 01:00:30,365
I'm sure he's ready.

1319
01:00:30,409 --> 01:00:33,281
Who do you think is gonna
take away the big trophy today?

1320
01:00:33,325 --> 01:00:34,543
Delta.

1321
01:00:36,241 --> 01:00:37,808
- Mr. Wilbur Force.
- Yes?

1322
01:00:37,851 --> 01:00:39,287
Delta Thompson, big fan.

1323
01:00:39,331 --> 01:00:41,115
Here's my demo tape.

1324
01:00:41,159 --> 01:00:43,683
It's my wrestling portfolio,
got a couple of my moves on 'em.

1325
01:00:43,727 --> 01:00:45,337
I thought maybe you could watch it

1326
01:00:45,380 --> 01:00:47,068
and give me some pointers,
and that'd be really cool

1327
01:00:47,078 --> 01:00:50,124
- because then you would show me.
- I'll see what I can do, okay?

1328
01:00:50,168 --> 01:00:52,083
- Okay.
- Um, do you know what?

1329
01:00:52,126 --> 01:00:55,216
- Can you hold this for a second?
- Yeah, of course.

1330
01:00:55,260 --> 01:00:56,468
All right, hey,
I'll see ya out there, okay?

1331
01:00:56,478 --> 01:00:58,567
See you out there on the court.

1332
01:01:03,355 --> 01:01:04,704
Yes.

1333
01:01:04,748 --> 01:01:07,446
I am here interviewing with Slaton Ralls.

1334
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:10,492
He is the chair referee at today's match.

1335
01:01:10,536 --> 01:01:12,320
All right, guys, tonight's a big night.

1336
01:01:12,364 --> 01:01:14,366
There's a tiny home on the line,
this is important.

1337
01:01:14,409 --> 01:01:16,411
This is not play around.

1338
01:01:23,114 --> 01:01:24,724
- Hey.
- Just came to wish you

1339
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:27,379
- good luck.
- Thanks, I'm gonna need it.

1340
01:01:41,262 --> 01:01:43,656
Goodbye.

1341
01:01:43,700 --> 01:01:45,387
Yeah, Butcher, you're gonna win,
and I love you,

1342
01:01:45,397 --> 01:01:47,573
and you're kind of like a dad figure to me.

1343
01:01:47,616 --> 01:01:50,619
Please don't... please, please don't lose.

1344
01:02:54,945 --> 01:02:56,675
Um, how are you feeling?
Do you have any words

1345
01:02:56,685 --> 01:03:00,341
that you'd like to give
to your mentor and your coach?

1346
01:03:00,385 --> 01:03:02,126
Good luck.

1347
01:03:13,137 --> 01:03:15,313
How y'all doing tonight?

1348
01:03:17,184 --> 01:03:19,752
Before this amazing, life-changing match,

1349
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:21,710
we have a little pre-show entertainment

1350
01:03:21,754 --> 01:03:23,790
- we'd like to introduce to you.
- Match is on, babe.

1351
01:03:23,800 --> 01:03:26,150
So, you know him,

1352
01:03:26,193 --> 01:03:27,673
- you love him.
- You love him.

1353
01:03:27,716 --> 01:03:30,197
Some of you who volunteer
might wrestle him.

1354
01:03:30,241 --> 01:03:33,722
It is... Wilbur Force!

1355
01:03:41,339 --> 01:03:43,297
Ugh, this guy gives me the heebie-jeebies.

1356
01:03:43,341 --> 01:03:44,821
You don't like Wilbur Force?

1357
01:03:44,864 --> 01:03:47,258
No, he looks like
he smells like mayonnaise.

1358
01:03:47,301 --> 01:03:49,913
We're looking for some volunt...

1359
01:03:49,956 --> 01:03:51,828
Volunteers.

1360
01:03:54,308 --> 01:04:01,359
Oh, say can you see,

1361
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:04,710
by the dawn's

1362
01:04:04,753 --> 01:04:08,235
early light,

1363
01:04:08,279 --> 01:04:13,110
what so proudly...

1364
01:04:20,204 --> 01:04:23,424
- You ready, Gordy?
- Yep, just got the diarrhea.

1365
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:27,428
Oh, say does that

1366
01:04:27,472 --> 01:04:30,692
star-spangled

1367
01:04:30,736 --> 01:04:35,045
banner yet wave...

1368
01:04:36,785 --> 01:04:38,918
- Babe, are you crying?
- Yeah.

1369
01:04:38,962 --> 01:04:41,834
O'er the land

1370
01:04:41,878 --> 01:04:46,665
of the free,

1371
01:04:46,708 --> 01:04:50,234
and the home

1372
01:04:50,277 --> 01:04:53,106
of the...

1373
01:04:55,152 --> 01:04:56,849
- Is it "brave"?
- Brave.

1374
01:04:56,893 --> 01:04:58,982
- Brave!
- Brave.

1375
01:05:02,072 --> 01:05:03,334
Thank you.

1376
01:05:03,377 --> 01:05:04,770
Come on.

1377
01:05:13,822 --> 01:05:16,651
Don't you hurt my baby!

1378
01:05:40,066 --> 01:05:41,720
He's got a pulse.

1379
01:05:55,168 --> 01:05:58,476
Ladies and gentlemen,
the event of the evening,

1380
01:05:58,519 --> 01:06:01,087
featuring the team of Delta Thompson

1381
01:06:01,131 --> 01:06:03,350
and Nobeck Ivandich.

1382
01:06:09,226 --> 01:06:13,404
Butcher Duke and Gordy.

1383
01:06:13,447 --> 01:06:15,014
The format for tonight's match

1384
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,712
is best two out of three games

1385
01:06:17,756 --> 01:06:19,279
wins the match.

1386
01:06:19,323 --> 01:06:22,239
Remember, a tiny home
is on the line tonight.

1387
01:06:24,937 --> 01:06:26,286
Let's go!

1388
01:06:26,330 --> 01:06:29,811
Let's go, Butcher, let's go!

1389
01:06:34,686 --> 01:06:38,037
- 15, love.
- All right, Butch, let's go.

1390
01:06:38,081 --> 01:06:40,300
Come on, come on.

1391
01:06:40,344 --> 01:06:41,867
Come on, Delta!

1392
01:06:52,008 --> 01:06:53,270
That's not what we needed.

1393
01:06:55,446 --> 01:06:57,883
15, all.

1394
01:07:11,027 --> 01:07:13,290
Come on.

1395
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:18,599
Yes!

1396
01:07:33,353 --> 01:07:34,789
Game one winner:

1397
01:07:34,833 --> 01:07:36,487
Delta Thompson.

1398
01:07:38,576 --> 01:07:41,057
Come on, Butchy!

1399
01:07:41,100 --> 01:07:42,536
Well, hello again.

1400
01:07:42,580 --> 01:07:44,190
It's been a while.

1401
01:07:44,234 --> 01:07:47,106
It sure don't look good
for Butch about now.

1402
01:07:47,150 --> 01:07:49,978
If he only had a better tennis partner.

1403
01:07:50,022 --> 01:07:51,589
A good friend.

1404
01:07:51,632 --> 01:07:53,243
A daughter with tennis experience

1405
01:07:53,286 --> 01:07:56,463
who needs to reconcile with her daddy.

1406
01:08:03,905 --> 01:08:06,865
Well, looky there.

1407
01:08:06,908 --> 01:08:09,737
- Oh, my gosh, you came.
- Well, I saw you on TV.

1408
01:08:09,781 --> 01:08:11,261
You're kinda getting killed out here.

1409
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,524
Yeah, I could definitely use you.

1410
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:15,178
Well, let's get you a tiny home.

1411
01:08:15,221 --> 01:08:16,614
Let's do it, come on.

1412
01:08:16,657 --> 01:08:18,572
Wait a minute.

1413
01:08:18,616 --> 01:08:20,313
Oh, come on, this isn't right.

1414
01:08:20,357 --> 01:08:22,707
You may not switch partners
in the middle of the match.

1415
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,926
Yeah, and we watched tape
on him, we know how he plays.

1416
01:08:24,970 --> 01:08:27,277
Come on, man, it's my daughter.

1417
01:08:27,320 --> 01:08:29,496
Let her play.

1418
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,151
Fine, but no funny business,

1419
01:08:32,195 --> 01:08:33,848
for real.

1420
01:08:41,552 --> 01:08:43,815
Let's go, baby, woo!

1421
01:08:50,256 --> 01:08:52,084
- Yes!
- 15, love.

1422
01:08:52,128 --> 01:08:53,433
That's my girl.

1423
01:08:58,873 --> 01:09:01,615
30, love.

1424
01:09:13,627 --> 01:09:15,194
- Here we go, wake up.
- Yeah.

1425
01:09:18,328 --> 01:09:19,807
Yes!

1426
01:09:22,201 --> 01:09:23,507
Game two winner:

1427
01:09:23,550 --> 01:09:25,117
Butcher Duke.

1428
01:09:27,424 --> 01:09:30,035
Listen, I know you don't speak English,

1429
01:09:30,078 --> 01:09:32,864
but come on, kill.

1430
01:09:32,907 --> 01:09:34,344
Kill.

1431
01:09:36,259 --> 01:09:38,957
Whoever wins this game wins the match.

1432
01:09:39,000 --> 01:09:42,047
Remember, a tiny home
is on the line tonight.

1433
01:09:48,314 --> 01:09:50,795
Love, 15.

1434
01:09:53,145 --> 01:09:54,581
Come on.

1435
01:09:57,062 --> 01:10:00,021
- Love, 30.
- You're doing good.

1436
01:10:05,070 --> 01:10:06,550
See.

1437
01:10:10,771 --> 01:10:13,121
You got this.

1438
01:10:13,165 --> 01:10:15,907
Love, 40.

1439
01:10:15,950 --> 01:10:17,390
I just want you know, whether we win

1440
01:10:17,430 --> 01:10:20,477
this match or not,
I'm just glad you're here.

1441
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,392
Okay, everyone's staring,
let's just get back.

1442
01:10:22,435 --> 01:10:24,611
Okay, real quick,
one more thing, one more thing.

1443
01:10:24,655 --> 01:10:26,613
- What?
- I do need to win

1444
01:10:26,657 --> 01:10:28,388
- this home though, though.
- Okay, yeah, Dad,

1445
01:10:28,398 --> 01:10:29,824
the ref is, like, staring at us right now.

1446
01:10:29,834 --> 01:10:31,183
Okay, okay.

1447
01:10:33,881 --> 01:10:35,492
15, 40.

1448
01:10:35,535 --> 01:10:37,276
Let's go, Em.

1449
01:10:39,670 --> 01:10:41,976
- Yes!
- 30, 40.

1450
01:10:42,020 --> 01:10:43,326
Yes.

1451
01:10:46,720 --> 01:10:48,635
Me.

1452
01:10:57,383 --> 01:10:58,906
Yes!

1453
01:11:06,131 --> 01:11:07,393
No way!

1454
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:13,747
- Oh yeah.
- Yes.

1455
01:11:17,360 --> 01:11:19,449
Oh, God.

1456
01:11:19,492 --> 01:11:22,060
Ah, it's all right, hey, it's all right.

1457
01:11:22,103 --> 01:11:23,931
Yes!

1458
01:11:44,691 --> 01:11:46,780
- Dang it!
- It looks like the next point

1459
01:11:46,824 --> 01:11:48,956
- will win, Butch?
- What'd you say?

1460
01:11:49,000 --> 01:11:52,351
I said, "It looks like
the next point will win, Butch."

1461
01:11:52,395 --> 01:11:54,135
I know how to keep score, turd burglar.

1462
01:11:54,179 --> 01:11:56,877
Dad, Dad, it's okay.

1463
01:11:56,921 --> 01:11:58,662
Do you breathing.

1464
01:11:58,705 --> 01:12:01,012
What are we gonna do?
It's the last point.

1465
01:12:01,055 --> 01:12:02,753
You remember the poach?

1466
01:12:02,796 --> 01:12:05,495
- Off the coast of Madagascar?
- Is there any other coast?

1467
01:12:05,538 --> 01:12:07,279
Oh, my God, let's do this.

1468
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:09,803
Sudden death, final point.

1469
01:12:09,847 --> 01:12:12,545
Delta, go Delta!

1470
01:12:12,589 --> 01:12:16,375
Quiet, please, a tiny home is on the line.

1471
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,159
I wanna win this home, it's obvious.

1472
01:12:18,203 --> 01:12:19,542
I wouldn't be training the way I am

1473
01:12:19,552 --> 01:12:21,119
if I didn't wanna win the home.

1474
01:12:21,162 --> 01:12:23,469
But, I need to know that
it's okay with the people I love

1475
01:12:23,513 --> 01:12:27,255
that, if I don't win it,

1476
01:12:27,299 --> 01:12:28,431
it's gonna be okay.

1477
01:13:05,642 --> 01:13:08,253
Yeah!

1478
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:10,027
Who gives this young lady
today in holy matrimony

1479
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:13,291
to this young man?

1480
01:15:13,334 --> 01:15:15,336
Her dead mother and I.

1481
01:15:37,315 --> 01:15:40,666
Well, things sure worked out for Butcher.

1482
01:15:40,710 --> 01:15:44,975
What a happy ending.

1483
01:15:45,018 --> 01:15:48,456
"But, what about Delta?"
you might be asking.

1484
01:15:48,500 --> 01:15:50,633
Hi, I'm Delta Thompson!

1485
01:15:50,676 --> 01:15:53,984
We have zero percent APR financing,

1486
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,942
and I know what that means now!

1487
01:15:55,986 --> 01:15:59,032
We've got tiny homes
we're excited to show you!

1488
01:15:59,076 --> 01:16:02,470
And we wanna serve you quality today!

1489
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:05,343
He lost the business.

1490
01:16:05,386 --> 01:16:09,129
But, he's pursuing his lifelong dream.

1491
01:16:24,841 --> 01:16:27,147
- Yeah!
- Yeah!

1492
01:16:37,505 --> 01:16:39,116
Give 'em what the people want.

1493
01:16:39,159 --> 01:16:40,987
- Oh yeah.
- You give 'em what the...

1494
01:16:41,031 --> 01:16:42,989
Give 'em what the people want.

1495
01:16:53,783 --> 01:16:56,307
Hot dog, I love wrestling.

1496
01:18:02,634 --> 01:18:05,376
Well, I hope you enjoyed our story.

1497
01:18:05,419 --> 01:18:07,204
I sure did.

1498
01:18:07,247 --> 01:18:09,075
Who you been talking to, Gordy?

1499
01:18:09,119 --> 01:18:11,425
You know who I'm talking to, Butch.

1500
01:18:14,167 --> 01:18:16,256
No, no, I don't.
