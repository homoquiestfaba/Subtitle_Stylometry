1
00:00:02,877 --> 00:00:06,047
(dramatic electronic music)

2
00:00:14,472 --> 00:00:16,933
They're calling him
the Jackson Strangler.

3
00:00:16,975 --> 00:00:18,101
Who is he?

4
00:00:18,143 --> 00:00:19,519
Where is he?

5
00:00:19,561 --> 00:00:20,603
(static crackling)

6
00:00:20,645 --> 00:00:21,789
We have a little
bit more information

7
00:00:21,813 --> 00:00:23,815
from the neighborhood's
pastor wife.

8
00:00:23,857 --> 00:00:24,857
Yes.

9
00:00:25,650 --> 00:00:26,818
If you know anything,

10
00:00:26,860 --> 00:00:28,111
this is a tragic incident.

11
00:00:28,153 --> 00:00:29,362
(static crackling)

12
00:00:29,404 --> 00:00:31,031
And this is not the
time to be silent.

13
00:00:31,072 --> 00:00:33,074
This is a very
tight-knit community,

14
00:00:33,116 --> 00:00:34,701
and we need you to come forward.

15
00:00:34,743 --> 00:00:38,997
Jackson Strangler needs
to be brought to justice.

16
00:00:39,039 --> 00:00:40,307
Have you heard that,
Jackson Strangler?

17
00:00:40,331 --> 00:00:41,833
We're coming for you.

18
00:00:41,875 --> 00:00:43,043
I'm Michelle Mitchell,

19
00:00:43,084 --> 00:00:45,003
and you're watching
Channel 10 News.

20
00:00:45,045 --> 00:00:46,087
(static crackling)

21
00:00:46,129 --> 00:00:47,398
Neighbors in the
community say that

22
00:00:47,422 --> 00:00:50,467
the crime is typically
extremely low.

23
00:00:50,508 --> 00:00:52,385
That's why they were
caught by surprise

24
00:00:52,427 --> 00:00:56,473
when informed that the Jackson
Strangler has struck again.

25
00:00:56,514 --> 00:00:58,058
(static crackling)

26
00:00:58,099 --> 00:00:59,976
Yeah, it's, uh...

27
00:01:00,018 --> 00:01:00,935
That's unfortunate.

28
00:01:00,977 --> 00:01:03,188
You know, um, this hit me hard.

29
00:01:03,229 --> 00:01:06,316
You know, I-I used to see her
around the neighborhood a lot.

30
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:09,795
(sighs) Didn't think it was
gonna happen here, you know,

31
00:01:09,819 --> 00:01:11,571
this Jackson Strangler thing.

32
00:01:11,613 --> 00:01:12,613
It's, um,

33
00:01:13,073 --> 00:01:14,157
it's gotta stop.

34
00:01:14,199 --> 00:01:16,076
It's, it's, it's too much.

35
00:01:16,117 --> 00:01:17,786
Like, when, when do it end?

36
00:01:19,120 --> 00:01:22,290

Why you on these
dating sites anyway?

75
00:03:15,153 --> 00:03:16,279
What up with old boy John,

76
00:03:16,321 --> 00:03:18,198
you remember John
with the crusty feet?

77
00:03:18,239 --> 00:03:19,157
He had crusty feet,

78
00:03:19,199 --> 00:03:20,408
but he was real good to you.

79
00:03:20,450 --> 00:03:23,161
First of all, I'm not
a little girl anymore.

80
00:03:23,203 --> 00:03:24,496
I am a grown woman.

81
00:03:24,537 --> 00:03:25,663
I'm trying to find a man,

82
00:03:25,705 --> 00:03:27,374
I don't need you
telling me what to do.

83
00:03:27,415 --> 00:03:30,543
Sylvester, you need to
find you something to do.

84
00:03:30,585 --> 00:03:31,585
Okay.

85
00:03:33,588 --> 00:03:35,298
[Bartender] Hi, what
can I get for you?

86
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,657
To my girl Tanya,

87
00:04:00,699 --> 00:04:04,577
who just so happens to
finally gotten a real job

88
00:04:04,619 --> 00:04:07,122
(chuckles) making some
real money downtown.

89
00:04:07,163 --> 00:04:08,307
Thank God!
(friends laughing)

90
00:04:08,331 --> 00:04:10,583
Maybe now you can
finally stop dancing.

91
00:04:11,876 --> 00:04:13,086
Whoo-hoo!

92
00:04:13,128 --> 00:04:15,463
Let me borrow a dollar.

93
00:04:15,505 --> 00:04:16,506
Girl,

94
00:04:16,548 --> 00:04:17,882
can I please get
my first paycheck

95
00:04:17,924 --> 00:04:19,300
before you get to begging?

96
00:04:20,385 --> 00:04:24,264
I should be asking you for
some money, Miss Lawyer.

97
00:04:24,305 --> 00:04:25,932
Well, as long as
you're not asking me,

98
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:27,434
because the last time I checked,

99
00:04:27,475 --> 00:04:29,102
I think you still
owe me 30 bucks

100
00:04:29,144 --> 00:04:30,287
from the last time we hung out.

101
00:04:30,311 --> 00:04:31,104
(Tanya mutters mockingly)
(friends laugh)

102
00:04:31,146 --> 00:04:32,063
Jessica,

103
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:33,606
girl, it's like that old saying.

104
00:04:33,648 --> 00:04:36,109
[Both] Long as I owe
you, you'll never go broke!

105
00:04:36,151 --> 00:04:38,611
(both laughing)

106
00:04:38,653 --> 00:04:40,822
[Jessica] Why do I
always feel so broke?

107
00:04:40,864 --> 00:04:42,115
I don't know.

108
00:04:42,157 --> 00:04:44,284
Probably because I
owe you money too.

109
00:04:44,325 --> 00:04:45,118
(friends laugh)

110
00:04:45,160 --> 00:04:46,953
That's a good one!

111
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:50,665
Girl, what's up with you?

112
00:04:52,083 --> 00:04:54,002
That guy over there.

113
00:04:54,044 --> 00:04:55,044
Do you see him?

114
00:04:56,338 --> 00:04:57,964
Well, yeah, he's
right in front of us.

115
00:04:58,006 --> 00:04:59,299
No.

116
00:04:59,341 --> 00:05:00,717
Do you see him?

117
00:05:01,760 --> 00:05:04,220
Girl, what are
you talking about?

118
00:05:04,262 --> 00:05:05,388
I don't know.

119
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:08,558
He looks real familiar.

120
00:05:14,272 --> 00:05:17,108
I think he's a killer.
(Elaine coughs)

121
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:18,150
A what?

122
00:05:19,944 --> 00:05:22,280
Ooh, a killer.

123
00:05:22,322 --> 00:05:24,324
Maybe he's got a gun, girls.

124
00:05:24,366 --> 00:05:25,784
No.

125
00:05:25,825 --> 00:05:26,868
Seriously.

126
00:05:28,453 --> 00:05:30,413
I've seen that face on the TV.

127
00:05:33,333 --> 00:05:35,377
(gasps) Wait.

128
00:05:36,544 --> 00:05:37,712
I think she right.

129
00:05:39,297 --> 00:05:41,508
I think that's the
Jackson Strangler.

130
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:44,843
No way.

131
00:05:46,971 --> 00:05:48,598
Girls,

132
00:05:48,640 --> 00:05:52,352
I think maybe you've had a
little too much to drink tonight.

133
00:05:52,394 --> 00:05:53,853
First of all,

134
00:05:53,895 --> 00:05:55,438
I don't drink.

135
00:05:55,480 --> 00:05:57,273
And second of all,

136
00:05:57,315 --> 00:05:58,566
I'm calling the police.

137
00:05:58,608 --> 00:05:59,442
[Elaine] Mm-mm, no.

138
00:05:59,484 --> 00:06:00,902
You can't do that.

139
00:06:00,944 --> 00:06:01,736
[Tanya] And why not?

140
00:06:01,778 --> 00:06:02,946
Because!

141
00:06:02,987 --> 00:06:05,240
If that's the guy
we think it is,

142
00:06:05,281 --> 00:06:06,616
this guy ain't no joke.

143
00:06:06,658 --> 00:06:09,369
They can't find one
witness on this guy.

144
00:06:09,411 --> 00:06:11,705
They all either come
up missing or dead.

145
00:06:12,747 --> 00:06:14,517
Then that's a risk I'm
just gonna have to take,

146
00:06:14,541 --> 00:06:16,042
now isn't it?

147
00:06:16,084 --> 00:06:17,377
(Elaine sighs)

148
00:06:17,419 --> 00:06:19,337
All right, but don't
say I didn't warn you.

149
00:06:19,379 --> 00:06:20,422
You never listen.

150
00:06:22,382 --> 00:06:25,427
(smooth R&B music)

151
00:06:33,727 --> 00:06:36,479
(quiet hip hop music)
(metal rattles)

152
00:06:36,521 --> 00:06:40,150
Man, how long we gotta
keep making these drop-offs?

153
00:06:40,191 --> 00:06:41,735
Till my kids turn 18, goofy.

154
00:06:42,610 --> 00:06:43,987
Well, how long is that?

155
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:46,406
(Pooch chuckles)

156
00:06:46,448 --> 00:06:49,242
Man, why we keep going
through this every month?

157
00:06:49,284 --> 00:06:50,744
How many kids do I got?

158
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:51,953
10.

159
00:06:51,995 --> 00:06:53,222
From those 10, how
many are from my wife?

160
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:54,372
None.

161
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:55,457
Exactly.

162
00:06:55,498 --> 00:06:56,291
Man, Pooch,

163
00:06:56,332 --> 00:06:57,792
that's a long time.

164
00:06:57,834 --> 00:07:00,628
I don't think I could do
that many deliveries, man.

165
00:07:00,670 --> 00:07:01,814
How about you?
You wanna make 'em?

166
00:07:01,838 --> 00:07:02,940
- I can do it.
- You wanna do 'em?

167
00:07:02,964 --> 00:07:03,631
- Yeah.
- Go on, get the money

168
00:07:03,673 --> 00:07:04,424
from this dude, man,

169
00:07:04,466 --> 00:07:05,592
since he don't want to.

170
00:07:05,633 --> 00:07:06,843
- You sure?
- Man, I got this.

171
00:07:06,885 --> 00:07:08,404
Oh, you know what?
Fall back, fall back.

172
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:09,929
Check this one out.

173
00:07:09,971 --> 00:07:11,931
You don't wanna make
the deliveries no more?

174
00:07:11,973 --> 00:07:13,933
It's not a problem,
you just let me know,

175
00:07:13,975 --> 00:07:14,768
all right?

176
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:15,953
We'll take care of everything.

177
00:07:15,977 --> 00:07:17,413
'Cause anything can
happen to you, you know.

178
00:07:17,437 --> 00:07:19,981
You can get shot
on the expressway,

179
00:07:20,023 --> 00:07:21,023
come up missing.

180
00:07:21,816 --> 00:07:22,960
But at least you
gave me a heads up

181
00:07:22,984 --> 00:07:25,111
so I can find somebody
to replace you.

182
00:07:25,153 --> 00:07:27,197
[Crew Member] Man, come on...

183
00:07:27,238 --> 00:07:28,406
I got this, bro.

184
00:07:28,448 --> 00:07:30,742
Come on, Pooch, you
would kill me, man?

185
00:07:31,993 --> 00:07:34,496
Look, man, we got four
days to make these drops.

186
00:07:34,537 --> 00:07:36,373
Some of my baby
mamas ain't nice.

187
00:07:36,414 --> 00:07:37,916
Do me a favor,

188
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:38,957
count the money.

189
00:07:43,129 --> 00:07:45,924
(low tense music)

190
00:08:12,283 --> 00:08:14,869
(door thunks)

191
00:08:14,911 --> 00:08:15,912
(door thuds)

192
00:08:15,954 --> 00:08:17,706
[Dennis] It took
you long enough.

193
00:08:17,747 --> 00:08:18,957
I had to get the rope.

194
00:08:18,998 --> 00:08:20,417
What rope?

195
00:08:20,458 --> 00:08:21,501
You said get the rope.

196
00:08:21,543 --> 00:08:22,561
I didn't say get the rope.

197
00:08:22,585 --> 00:08:24,421
I already put 'em
in the rug, man.

198
00:08:24,462 --> 00:08:25,523
If I was gonna wait
for you and the rope,

199
00:08:25,547 --> 00:08:27,757
she would have
turned like a mummy.

200
00:08:27,799 --> 00:08:30,260
(scoffs) All right.

201
00:08:30,301 --> 00:08:31,261
Who car is this?

202
00:08:31,302 --> 00:08:33,304
Who you think it is?

203
00:08:33,346 --> 00:08:34,305
It's that chick, no?

204
00:08:34,347 --> 00:08:35,515
She's a nurse.

205
00:08:35,557 --> 00:08:38,018
What, you think I change
profession overnight?

206
00:08:38,059 --> 00:08:40,562
Stop asking these
dumb questions.

207
00:08:42,397 --> 00:08:43,606
You know what?

208
00:08:43,648 --> 00:08:44,524
Hurry up and get
her outta here, man.

209
00:08:44,566 --> 00:08:46,735
I got a lot of stops to make.

210
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,776
Right.

211
00:08:48,403 --> 00:08:50,530
Aren't you gonna help me?

212
00:08:50,572 --> 00:08:51,489
I already did.

213
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:52,323
I get the bitch,

214
00:08:52,365 --> 00:08:53,533
and you dump them.

215
00:08:53,575 --> 00:08:55,410
And the trunk is open
for you, Cinderella.

216
00:08:55,452 --> 00:08:56,536
Hurry up, man.

217
00:08:56,578 --> 00:08:58,288
I always get the
short end of the stick.

218
00:08:58,329 --> 00:08:59,497
(Dennis laughs)

219
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:01,058
You rather be like
the chick in the back

220
00:09:01,082 --> 00:09:04,002
and be the short
end of this knife?

221
00:09:04,044 --> 00:09:06,713
(both laugh)

222
00:09:06,755 --> 00:09:07,756
Wait a minute...

223
00:09:08,715 --> 00:09:10,050
Get the body outta here,

224
00:09:10,091 --> 00:09:11,051
dump it in the river.

225
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:12,092
I gotta go.

226
00:09:12,635 --> 00:09:13,803
I ain't got all day.

227
00:09:14,971 --> 00:09:16,139
(door slams)

228
00:09:16,181 --> 00:09:18,641
(Dennis sighs)

229
00:09:22,354 --> 00:09:23,605
Hey!

230
00:09:24,314 --> 00:09:25,857
She's not even wrapped up, man!

231
00:09:27,692 --> 00:09:29,069
Okay, do it!

232
00:09:29,110 --> 00:09:30,110
She heavy!

233
00:09:30,612 --> 00:09:31,863
Hey, I need some help!

234
00:09:33,198 --> 00:09:34,616
Jesus, man.

235
00:09:34,657 --> 00:09:36,159
(door clunks)

236
00:09:36,201 --> 00:09:36,951
(alert dings)

237
00:09:36,993 --> 00:09:39,204
Gotta do everything myself.

238
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,624
(door slams)

239
00:09:45,293 --> 00:09:46,544
You...

240
00:09:46,586 --> 00:09:48,880
Man, you didn't
even wrap her, man.

241
00:09:48,922 --> 00:09:51,299
You want me to
put a bow on it?

242
00:09:51,341 --> 00:09:52,634
Come on, man.

243
00:09:52,676 --> 00:09:54,427
This is your first time?
I mean...

244
00:09:54,469 --> 00:09:57,222
(low tense music)

245
00:10:33,425 --> 00:10:35,802
(door slams)

246
00:10:39,764 --> 00:10:40,640
What's up?

247
00:10:40,682 --> 00:10:41,641
He with you?

248
00:10:41,683 --> 00:10:42,475
[Rashaad] I got him.

249
00:10:42,517 --> 00:10:43,476
This guy's certifiable.

250
00:10:43,518 --> 00:10:44,718
I can't get him to say a word.

251
00:10:45,812 --> 00:10:50,191
Put him in the car,
I'll make him talk.

252
00:10:57,365 --> 00:10:59,701
(door slams)

253
00:11:05,623 --> 00:11:07,667
So what'd you do with the body?

254
00:11:07,709 --> 00:11:08,585
What body?

255
00:11:08,626 --> 00:11:11,338
Man, you gonna play stupid?

256
00:11:11,379 --> 00:11:12,589
Who said that I was playing?

257
00:11:12,630 --> 00:11:14,400
Okay, look, we gonna
do this one of two ways,

258
00:11:14,424 --> 00:11:16,009
the hard way or my way.

259
00:11:16,968 --> 00:11:18,595
You do the picking,
but either way,

260
00:11:18,636 --> 00:11:20,430
you are gonna lose.

261
00:11:20,472 --> 00:11:24,059
I got four witnesses that put
you at the scene of the crime.

262
00:11:24,100 --> 00:11:25,226
Three.

263
00:11:25,268 --> 00:11:26,478
What?

264
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:27,687
Yep.

265
00:11:27,729 --> 00:11:29,689
As of right now, you
only got three witness.

266
00:11:29,731 --> 00:11:31,941
The fourth witness is dead.

267
00:11:33,401 --> 00:11:34,401
Say what?

268
00:11:35,612 --> 00:11:36,821
Yo, Jacobs!

269
00:11:39,366 --> 00:11:41,701
How many witnesses we
got in the Jackson case?

270
00:11:41,743 --> 00:11:43,870
Well, we had four.

271
00:11:43,912 --> 00:11:47,540
They found one of the ladies
beaten to death in her closet.

272
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:49,584
Husband came home,
put up his jacket,

273
00:11:49,626 --> 00:11:50,418
found his old lady
(shutter clicks)

274
00:11:50,460 --> 00:11:51,460
hanging there instead.

275
00:11:52,379 --> 00:11:53,713
Oh, and get this,

276
00:11:53,755 --> 00:11:55,107
they found the same
rope around her neck

277
00:11:55,131 --> 00:11:56,131
as the others.

278
00:11:56,966 --> 00:11:59,552
All signs lead to Dennis.

279
00:11:59,594 --> 00:12:00,720
How is that possible?

280
00:12:00,762 --> 00:12:01,930
He was in custody yesterday.

281
00:12:01,971 --> 00:12:03,890
Well, your guess
is as good as mine.

282
00:12:05,350 --> 00:12:07,060
(Rashaad sighs)

283
00:12:07,102 --> 00:12:08,102
Hey, guys,

284
00:12:09,437 --> 00:12:10,437
I know people.

285
00:12:11,564 --> 00:12:13,900
You really think
it's just one of us?

286
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:17,612
(chuckles) I got a team.

287
00:12:17,654 --> 00:12:19,698
And as of right now,

288
00:12:19,739 --> 00:12:22,492
you only have one
body on your watch.

289
00:12:22,534 --> 00:12:23,827
Do you wanna make it two?

290
00:12:23,868 --> 00:12:25,245
Man, get this
animal outta here.

291
00:12:25,286 --> 00:12:29,165
Yeah, it's about time
I get outta this car.

292
00:12:34,587 --> 00:12:37,173
(door slams)

293
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:42,929
(door slams)

294
00:12:42,971 --> 00:12:46,266
(deep dramatic music)

295
00:12:50,603 --> 00:12:53,106
(phone chimes)

296
00:13:05,493 --> 00:13:07,996
(phone chimes)

297
00:13:12,834 --> 00:13:15,545
(phone chimes)

298
00:13:24,512 --> 00:13:26,431
Hey, baby, I'm sorry.

299
00:13:27,640 --> 00:13:29,309
(sighs) I got a
big case at work.

300
00:13:29,351 --> 00:13:30,643
Yeah, I kind of figured.

301
00:13:30,685 --> 00:13:32,812
But you could have called,
I've been waiting forever.

302
00:13:32,854 --> 00:13:33,854
Hey, I'm sorry.

303
00:13:35,440 --> 00:13:37,359
(Rashaad chuckles)

304
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:38,400
I'm sorry.

305
00:13:39,027 --> 00:13:40,737
Did you order yet?

306
00:13:40,779 --> 00:13:42,197
No, I was waiting for you.

307
00:13:42,238 --> 00:13:44,324
Oh, okay.
(phone rings)

308
00:13:44,366 --> 00:13:48,578
Hold on.

309
00:13:48,620 --> 00:13:50,663
Okay, I gotta, I
gotta take this.

310
00:13:50,705 --> 00:13:52,332
Just a second. Hello?

311
00:13:52,374 --> 00:13:54,334
Whoa, whoa, whoa,
whoa, whoa, slow down.

312
00:13:55,877 --> 00:13:58,963
No, no, you are not
going to make that call.

313
00:13:59,005 --> 00:14:02,133
Why would you?
(deep tense music)

314
00:14:02,175 --> 00:14:04,678
Look, I'm trying to protect you!

315
00:14:04,719 --> 00:14:05,804
And you...

316
00:14:05,845 --> 00:14:06,971
Hello?

317
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:08,890
Hello?

318
00:14:09,724 --> 00:14:12,686
(Rashaad exhales sharply)

319
00:14:12,727 --> 00:14:13,978
Look, baby, I-I gotta go.

320
00:14:14,020 --> 00:14:14,854
Rain check, okay?

321
00:14:14,896 --> 00:14:16,022
Rain check what?

322
00:14:16,064 --> 00:14:17,857
You just got here!
And now I gotta go.

323
00:14:17,899 --> 00:14:18,775
You can't.

324
00:14:18,817 --> 00:14:19,734
But I will.

325
00:14:19,776 --> 00:14:20,694
I need you!

326
00:14:20,735 --> 00:14:21,975
I have to go home to my wife!

327
00:14:41,756 --> 00:14:44,592
(insects chirping)

328
00:14:50,807 --> 00:14:52,892
(door knocks)

329
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:55,895
No, I'm not as happy
as a caged bird. Free!

330
00:14:55,937 --> 00:14:57,856
(Tanya laughs)

331
00:14:57,897 --> 00:14:59,858
Hold on one second. Hold on.

332
00:14:59,899 --> 00:15:01,818
(door squeaks)
(alarm beeps)

333
00:15:01,860 --> 00:15:04,195
(Tanya laughs)

334
00:15:04,237 --> 00:15:05,905
Say what?
(door thuds)

335
00:15:05,947 --> 00:15:09,451
(scoffs) You know how I do.
(envelope rustling)

336
00:15:09,492 --> 00:15:10,577
Hm.

337
00:15:10,618 --> 00:15:11,745
(Tanya chuckles)

338
00:15:11,786 --> 00:15:14,122
Yeah, well, look, when
the boys are away,

339
00:15:14,164 --> 00:15:16,082
and it's just me
and my lonesome,

340
00:15:16,124 --> 00:15:19,377
trust me, it's gonna
be a good night.

341
00:15:19,419 --> 00:15:20,920
(Tanya laughs)

342
00:15:20,962 --> 00:15:23,590
Girl, they went with my
mama to some oldies concert.

343
00:15:23,631 --> 00:15:26,760
You know she always trying
to put 'em up on the dusties.

344
00:15:26,801 --> 00:15:27,969
(laughs) Yeah.

345
00:15:29,929 --> 00:15:31,973
What you mean,
"What about Alex?"

346
00:15:32,807 --> 00:15:34,017
He's at Bible study.

347
00:15:35,894 --> 00:15:37,854
But guess who finally
got the nerve?

348
00:15:37,896 --> 00:15:39,105
(Tanya laughs)

349
00:15:39,147 --> 00:15:41,816
Guess who finally got
the nerve to stop?

350
00:15:41,858 --> 00:15:42,984
I'm tired.

351
00:15:44,235 --> 00:15:47,947
Yeah, well, it's what's
best for me and my boys.

352
00:15:47,989 --> 00:15:49,407
(Tanya laughs softly)

353
00:15:49,449 --> 00:15:51,469
But I wouldn't have been able
to do it without you, girl.

354
00:15:51,493 --> 00:15:52,952
You've been my rock.

355
00:15:52,994 --> 00:15:54,621
(Tanya laughs)

356
00:15:54,662 --> 00:15:55,663
Yeah.

357
00:15:55,705 --> 00:15:56,705
I know.

358
00:15:58,541 --> 00:16:01,628
(deep ominous music)

359
00:16:15,517 --> 00:16:17,769
(phone thuds)

360
00:16:19,854 --> 00:16:22,065
What are you doing here?

361
00:16:25,568 --> 00:16:26,653
(intense dramatic music)

362
00:16:26,695 --> 00:16:29,406
(Tanya screaming)

363
00:16:34,202 --> 00:16:35,078
[Rashaad] Hey, baby.

364
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,037
Hey, babe.

365
00:16:36,079 --> 00:16:36,871
Mm.
How you doing?

366
00:16:36,913 --> 00:16:38,373
How was your day?

367
00:16:38,415 --> 00:16:41,001
Bad. (laughs)

368
00:16:41,042 --> 00:16:43,503
All on account of the
Jackson Strangler.

369
00:16:43,545 --> 00:16:44,629
The Jackson who?

370
00:16:44,671 --> 00:16:45,964
Strangler.

371
00:16:46,006 --> 00:16:47,507
The guy, it's been
all over the news.

372
00:16:47,549 --> 00:16:48,883
Oh, I've been swamped.

373
00:16:48,925 --> 00:16:50,969
All right, so a
guy walks into a bar,

374
00:16:51,011 --> 00:16:52,178
picks up random women,

375
00:16:52,220 --> 00:16:53,513
two or three hours later,

376
00:16:53,555 --> 00:16:54,681
they find 'em strangled.

377
00:16:55,557 --> 00:16:56,516
- Wow.
- Mm-hmm.

378
00:16:56,558 --> 00:16:57,598
And that's not the kicker.

379
00:16:58,476 --> 00:17:01,396
This guy's been on the
run for three months.

380
00:17:01,438 --> 00:17:02,897
No witnesses.

381
00:17:02,939 --> 00:17:03,940
Dang, none?

382
00:17:03,982 --> 00:17:05,150
Not one.

383
00:17:06,276 --> 00:17:07,694
Hmm.

384
00:17:07,736 --> 00:17:09,696
Wow.

385
00:17:09,738 --> 00:17:12,032
(low soft music)

386
00:17:12,073 --> 00:17:13,950
Where's your ring?

387
00:17:13,992 --> 00:17:15,535
Huh?

388
00:17:15,577 --> 00:17:16,577
Your ring.

389
00:17:17,912 --> 00:17:18,747
Ah, it's...

390
00:17:18,788 --> 00:17:20,123
I think it's...

391
00:17:20,165 --> 00:17:22,667
I-I think my hand got
all sweaty at the office,

392
00:17:22,709 --> 00:17:23,543
and I took it off,

393
00:17:23,585 --> 00:17:25,420
and I just threw it on the desk.

394
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,212
The office?

395
00:17:26,254 --> 00:17:27,630
- Mm-hmm.
- Yeah, you,

396
00:17:27,672 --> 00:17:29,066
you said you were working
in the field today,

397
00:17:29,090 --> 00:17:30,675
said you weren't
going in the office.

398
00:17:30,717 --> 00:17:31,509
- Huh?
- Said you weren't going

399
00:17:31,551 --> 00:17:32,469
in the office.

400
00:17:32,510 --> 00:17:34,554
- Huh?
- You said you weren't going

401
00:17:34,596 --> 00:17:36,014
in the office.

402
00:17:36,056 --> 00:17:37,724
Yes, I did!

403
00:17:37,766 --> 00:17:39,059
No, no,

404
00:17:39,100 --> 00:17:40,244
you said you weren't
going in the office,

405
00:17:40,268 --> 00:17:41,728
and that was today

406
00:17:41,770 --> 00:17:44,189
'cause I specifically
remember you saying today.

407
00:17:44,230 --> 00:17:46,191
No, no, I didn't.

408
00:17:46,232 --> 00:17:47,335
Yes, you did.
No, I didn't.

409
00:17:47,359 --> 00:17:49,110
- You did!
- No, I didn't.

410
00:17:49,152 --> 00:17:50,153
(Angie sighs)

411
00:17:50,195 --> 00:17:51,571
Look, no, I didn't!

412
00:17:51,613 --> 00:17:53,090
I mean, it could have
been today, yesterday,

413
00:17:53,114 --> 00:17:54,074
could have been last year.

414
00:17:54,115 --> 00:17:55,367
What difference does it make?

415
00:17:55,408 --> 00:17:56,927
Can I just finish the story?
Okay, okay,

416
00:17:56,951 --> 00:17:58,036
fine, fine, go ahead.

417
00:17:58,078 --> 00:17:59,096
[Rashaad] Without
being interrupted?

418
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:00,121
Yes, please, do finish.

419
00:18:01,247 --> 00:18:02,791
Please finish.
Okay.

420
00:18:02,832 --> 00:18:03,832
Yes, go ahead.

421
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:06,920
Where was I?

422
00:18:06,961 --> 00:18:07,962
Um...

423
00:18:08,004 --> 00:18:08,797
No witnesses.

424
00:18:08,838 --> 00:18:10,048
No witnesses, right.

425
00:18:10,090 --> 00:18:12,425
Up until four ladies
come out of a bar

426
00:18:12,467 --> 00:18:15,178
and see a woman getting into
the car with the suspect.

427
00:18:15,220 --> 00:18:18,098
Okay, so you do
have some leads?

428
00:18:18,139 --> 00:18:19,158
That's good.
No, it's bad.

429
00:18:19,182 --> 00:18:21,476
Well, no, it's bad
because (sighs)

430
00:18:21,518 --> 00:18:24,270
one of the women ended up dead.

431
00:18:24,312 --> 00:18:25,605
- What?
- Yeah, the woman,

432
00:18:25,647 --> 00:18:27,649
husband comes home,
opens the closet,

433
00:18:27,691 --> 00:18:28,942
she's strangled.

434
00:18:28,983 --> 00:18:29,776
So now we're down
to three witness.

435
00:18:29,818 --> 00:18:31,236
And the funny thing is,

436
00:18:31,277 --> 00:18:36,157
this murder has the same MO
of a guy we have in custody.

437
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:39,285
Okay, well,

438
00:18:39,327 --> 00:18:41,121
but how can he be involved

439
00:18:41,162 --> 00:18:43,373
if he's, he's in your custody?

440
00:18:43,415 --> 00:18:44,666
I said the exact same thing.

441
00:18:44,708 --> 00:18:46,376
(phone rings)

442
00:18:46,418 --> 00:18:48,545
[Angie] (sighs) Weird.

443
00:18:48,586 --> 00:18:49,921
Hello?

444
00:18:49,963 --> 00:18:51,172
Hey, Jacobs, what's up?

445
00:18:53,174 --> 00:18:54,175
What?

446
00:18:57,095 --> 00:18:58,304
Where?

447
00:18:59,973 --> 00:19:01,307
Lexington and what?

448
00:19:02,934 --> 00:19:04,102
All right.

449
00:19:04,144 --> 00:19:06,146
All right, all
right, I'm on my way.

450
00:19:06,187 --> 00:19:06,980
Babe, I gotta go.
What is it?

451
00:19:07,022 --> 00:19:08,064
What is it? W-wait, what?

452
00:19:08,106 --> 00:19:09,166
- They found another-
- Wait, what?

453
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,358
They found another body.

454
00:19:10,400 --> 00:19:12,277
You said Lexington?
Lexington and what?

455
00:19:12,318 --> 00:19:14,029
(Rashaad sighs)

456
00:19:14,070 --> 00:19:16,239
Rashaad, Lexington and what?

457
00:19:18,283 --> 00:19:19,909
It's Lexington and Sixth.

458
00:19:20,827 --> 00:19:22,162
Sixth?

459
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,621
Babe,

460
00:19:23,663 --> 00:19:26,291
that's where Valerie
and Tanya lives.

461
00:19:26,332 --> 00:19:28,209
I know, baby.

462
00:19:28,251 --> 00:19:30,337
I know. I'll be back.

463
00:19:36,134 --> 00:19:39,429
(deep unsettling music)

464
00:19:39,471 --> 00:19:43,266
(camera shutter clicking)

465
00:19:47,896 --> 00:19:49,939
I don't get it.

466
00:19:49,981 --> 00:19:51,941
I was just on the
phone with her.

467
00:19:54,027 --> 00:19:55,904
What did she sound like?

468
00:19:58,073 --> 00:19:59,366
All right, I guess.

469
00:20:01,868 --> 00:20:04,204
I mean, she was in a good mood.

470
00:20:04,245 --> 00:20:05,997
Her, her kids were away,

471
00:20:08,291 --> 00:20:09,834
she was enjoying her time.

472
00:20:12,170 --> 00:20:15,173
She was happy to finally
be breaking off things

473
00:20:15,215 --> 00:20:16,341
with this guy.

474
00:20:17,050 --> 00:20:18,426
[Detective] Really?

475
00:20:18,468 --> 00:20:19,468
Yeah.

476
00:20:21,096 --> 00:20:23,431
Unfortunately, it
didn't go as planned.

477
00:20:25,934 --> 00:20:26,934
Wow.

478
00:20:28,603 --> 00:20:31,940
Is there anything
else you can think of?

479
00:20:31,981 --> 00:20:37,278
(sniffs) Look, I just
need a moment, all right?

480
00:20:39,114 --> 00:20:40,073
I'm Detective Williams.

481
00:20:40,115 --> 00:20:41,324
Private Investigator Tony.

482
00:20:41,366 --> 00:20:42,367
What do we got?

483
00:20:42,409 --> 00:20:44,202
Well, no signs
of forced entry,

484
00:20:44,244 --> 00:20:45,829
but this is
definitely a homicide.

485
00:20:45,870 --> 00:20:47,205
[Rashaad] Hm.

486
00:20:47,247 --> 00:20:50,291
We had blood that we sent
to the lab for processing.

487
00:20:50,333 --> 00:20:53,294
Vic's in her mid
twenties, cute girl.

488
00:20:53,336 --> 00:20:55,422
She lives here with her mother.

489
00:20:55,463 --> 00:20:57,424
Her mom was out to a concert

490
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:59,843
and came home and found a rope
around her daughter's neck.

491
00:20:59,884 --> 00:21:01,261
Daughter's name is-

492
00:21:01,302 --> 00:21:02,302
- Tanya Griffin.

493
00:21:02,971 --> 00:21:04,097
Oh, so you know her?

494
00:21:04,139 --> 00:21:05,306
Yeah, um,

495
00:21:06,307 --> 00:21:07,600
it's my wife's cousin.

496
00:21:08,518 --> 00:21:09,518
Um,

497
00:21:10,729 --> 00:21:14,065
Val, her mother, took my
wife in when she was a kid

498
00:21:14,107 --> 00:21:16,443
after her mother had died, so...

499
00:21:16,484 --> 00:21:18,528
They're, they're real close.

500
00:21:18,570 --> 00:21:20,739
Oh my gosh, I can't imagine.

501
00:21:20,780 --> 00:21:22,198
Wow.

502
00:21:22,240 --> 00:21:24,951
Okay, I'm gonna keep a
close eye on this case.

503
00:21:24,993 --> 00:21:26,161
- Okay.
- Okay?

504
00:21:26,202 --> 00:21:29,205
And I want you to give
my regards to your wife.

505
00:21:29,247 --> 00:21:30,206
I will, I will.

506
00:21:30,248 --> 00:21:31,458
Okay.

507
00:21:31,499 --> 00:21:33,585
We're gonna find
out who did this,

508
00:21:33,626 --> 00:21:35,754
and when we do, it's
not gonna be pretty.

509
00:21:37,714 --> 00:21:38,714
Yeah. Yeah.

510
00:21:39,924 --> 00:21:41,092
Oh.

511
00:21:41,134 --> 00:21:42,719
I gotta get going.

512
00:21:42,761 --> 00:21:45,138
Uh, my husband and I are
celebrating our 20th anniversary,

513
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,223
and I wanna get home quick

514
00:21:47,265 --> 00:21:49,351
so I can celebrate
the 21st with him too.

515
00:21:50,685 --> 00:21:53,146
So, but I'm pretty sure you
can handle all this, right?

516
00:21:53,188 --> 00:21:53,980
Yeah. Yeah, I got it.

517
00:21:54,022 --> 00:21:55,231
Yeah.
Okay.

518
00:21:55,273 --> 00:21:57,359
Hey, take care of yourself.

519
00:21:59,152 --> 00:22:00,320
[Rashaad] I will. You too.

520
00:22:00,362 --> 00:22:02,072
[Tony] Okay, thanks.

521
00:22:06,451 --> 00:22:09,371
(door squeaks)

522
00:22:15,126 --> 00:22:17,337
(alarm chimes)
(door thuds)

523
00:22:17,379 --> 00:22:20,340
(Angie breathing shallowly)

524
00:22:20,382 --> 00:22:23,593
(tense somber music)

525
00:22:27,972 --> 00:22:28,848
(Angie cries)
Angie,

526
00:22:28,890 --> 00:22:30,225
what are you doing here?

527
00:22:30,266 --> 00:22:31,351
What are you doing here?

528
00:22:31,393 --> 00:22:33,019
I assumed you
weren't gonna tell me.

529
00:22:33,061 --> 00:22:35,230
This is not the time or
place for this, all right?

530
00:22:35,271 --> 00:22:37,565
I will talk to you
when we get home.

531
00:22:37,607 --> 00:22:38,483
You get-

532
00:22:38,525 --> 00:22:40,819
- You want me to
go home and wait

533
00:22:40,860 --> 00:22:43,822
so someone else in my
family can get murdered

534
00:22:43,863 --> 00:22:44,614
and you not tell me?

535
00:22:44,656 --> 00:22:46,241
Babe, look, listen to me.

536
00:22:46,282 --> 00:22:48,785
Now, don't do-
Do not call me babe!

537
00:22:52,330 --> 00:22:54,207
You are wrong.

538
00:22:54,249 --> 00:22:56,501
You knew she was a
witness in this case,

539
00:22:56,543 --> 00:22:58,378
and you didn't do anything!

540
00:22:58,420 --> 00:22:59,713
You didn't do anything!
Look...

541
00:22:59,754 --> 00:23:00,422
Look...

542
00:23:00,463 --> 00:23:01,463
Hey, Val.

543
00:23:03,466 --> 00:23:06,553
Oh, auntie.
(Valerie cries)

544
00:23:06,594 --> 00:23:10,348
(Valerie mutters indistinctly)

545
00:23:10,390 --> 00:23:11,850
Oh, my baby girl.

546
00:23:17,272 --> 00:23:19,399
They took my one and only.

547
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:20,567
(Valerie cries)

548
00:23:20,608 --> 00:23:24,237
Somebody help me. (crying)

549
00:23:24,279 --> 00:23:26,573
(Angie shushing)

550
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:28,074
It's all right.

551
00:23:28,116 --> 00:23:29,325
It's okay.

552
00:23:29,367 --> 00:23:31,828
It's okay. We'll
get through this.

553
00:23:31,870 --> 00:23:32,912
Hey.

554
00:23:32,954 --> 00:23:33,788
You know, Val, I
wish I could have...

555
00:23:33,830 --> 00:23:35,248
(hand slaps)
You shut it.

556
00:23:35,290 --> 00:23:36,833
I looked through her cell phone,

557
00:23:36,875 --> 00:23:40,754
and I saw all the text
messages that you sent her.

558
00:23:40,795 --> 00:23:41,379
What?

559
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,048
Oh yeah.

560
00:23:43,089 --> 00:23:44,089
Your husband

561
00:23:45,008 --> 00:23:48,303
knew that my baby
girl was in danger.

562
00:23:48,345 --> 00:23:50,680
Oh, but he wanted
to play Mr. Columbo.

563
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:54,267
What is she talking
about, Rashaad?

564
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,394
Via text, and I'll quote,

565
00:23:56,436 --> 00:23:57,479
"Don't worry about it.

566
00:23:58,271 --> 00:23:59,939
I'll protect you."

567
00:23:59,981 --> 00:24:02,484
How dare you try
to protect someone,

568
00:24:02,525 --> 00:24:04,611
and you can't even
protect your own wife.

569
00:24:04,652 --> 00:24:05,612
Look, Auntie Val, I-

570
00:24:05,653 --> 00:24:08,281
- Only by marriage.

571
00:24:08,323 --> 00:24:09,741
Ms. Thomas,

572
00:24:09,783 --> 00:24:12,285
we need you to come with us to
go over some of the details.

573
00:24:12,327 --> 00:24:13,495
Okay.

574
00:24:14,454 --> 00:24:15,789
Listen,

575
00:24:15,830 --> 00:24:17,665
I don't know what
you're gonna do,

576
00:24:17,707 --> 00:24:19,459
and I don't know how
you're gonna do it,

577
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:21,628
but you better find out who
did this to my daughter.

578
00:24:21,670 --> 00:24:23,838
Do you understand me?

579
00:24:25,382 --> 00:24:26,591
Yes, ma'am.

580
00:24:32,389 --> 00:24:35,684
(Angie sighs softly)

581
00:24:37,185 --> 00:24:38,645
I'll see you at home.

582
00:24:48,279 --> 00:24:49,322
Why?

583
00:24:49,364 --> 00:24:51,825
(Dennis laughing)

584
00:24:51,866 --> 00:24:52,866
Why not?

585
00:24:54,494 --> 00:24:55,495
Look, man,

586
00:24:55,537 --> 00:24:57,122
now, you hit that one girl,

587
00:24:58,832 --> 00:25:00,834
and it's like, "Okay,
I'll take that one,"

588
00:25:00,875 --> 00:25:02,877
but now you messed
with my family, man.

589
00:25:03,920 --> 00:25:05,296
And why you gonna
mess with Tanya?

590
00:25:06,506 --> 00:25:07,733
Why are you gonna
mess with Tanya?

591
00:25:07,757 --> 00:25:09,300
Tanya ain't done
nothing to anybody.

592
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,844
She, she's a good girl, man.

593
00:25:10,885 --> 00:25:11,511
Who?

594
00:25:11,553 --> 00:25:13,096
Tanya!

595
00:25:13,138 --> 00:25:14,431
Man,

596
00:25:14,472 --> 00:25:17,142
I didn't tell them to
knock off no Tanya.

597
00:25:17,183 --> 00:25:18,935
And let me tell you something,

598
00:25:18,977 --> 00:25:21,563
I took a lot of lives
off these streets,

599
00:25:21,604 --> 00:25:23,606
but Tanya was not one of them.

600
00:25:24,399 --> 00:25:25,984
But, uh,

601
00:25:26,026 --> 00:25:28,862
I really like the name,
maybe I should have.

602
00:25:28,903 --> 00:25:31,740
Well, if you didn't
do it, who did?

603
00:25:31,781 --> 00:25:34,409
If it was my job to find out,

604
00:25:34,451 --> 00:25:35,845
I would be the one
wearing the badge,

605
00:25:35,869 --> 00:25:37,454
now, wouldn't I, my brother?

606
00:25:37,495 --> 00:25:38,580
I ain't your brother!

607
00:25:39,622 --> 00:25:42,459
It looks like you got
a lot of work to do.

608
00:25:42,500 --> 00:25:43,500
Jacobs!

609
00:25:44,627 --> 00:25:45,628
Take him, man.

610
00:25:48,673 --> 00:25:52,886
(sighs) Here we go again.

611
00:25:52,927 --> 00:25:55,263

my wife and I are truly praying
for you and your family.

677
00:29:14,295 --> 00:29:17,424
Your daughter spent a
tremendous amount of time

678
00:29:17,465 --> 00:29:21,761
along with Brother Alex
doing anything and everything

679
00:29:21,803 --> 00:29:23,722
to bless the house of the Lord.

680
00:29:23,763 --> 00:29:25,765
And I am so happy

681
00:29:25,807 --> 00:29:30,353
that she made it right
before she left us.

682
00:29:30,395 --> 00:29:31,896
So if there's anything at all,

683
00:29:31,938 --> 00:29:33,773
and I do mean anything,

684
00:29:33,815 --> 00:29:35,567
we're here for you.

685
00:29:35,608 --> 00:29:37,610

[Valerie] Thank you.

690
00:29:46,870 --> 00:29:48,747
So sorry for your loss.

691
00:29:48,788 --> 00:29:49,956
This is from Poochie.

692
00:29:49,998 --> 00:29:52,959
(Valerie mutters)

693
00:29:54,586 --> 00:29:55,879
I'll be right back.

694
00:30:00,133 --> 00:30:01,384
[Pooch] Everything cool?

695
00:30:01,426 --> 00:30:02,695
- Yeah, everything good, man.
- She done?

696
00:30:02,719 --> 00:30:04,079
- Yes, sir.
- All right, what's up.

697
00:30:05,805 --> 00:30:07,033
Yo, Pooch,
(tense hip hop music)

698
00:30:07,057 --> 00:30:08,391
what you doing here, man?

699
00:30:08,433 --> 00:30:09,601
(Pooch chuckles)

700
00:30:09,642 --> 00:30:11,245
It's funny, I could
ask you the same thing.

701
00:30:11,269 --> 00:30:11,853
Really?

702
00:30:11,895 --> 00:30:13,730
Yeah, really.

703
00:30:13,772 --> 00:30:15,648
See, I'm surprised to
see you here at all.

704
00:30:15,690 --> 00:30:17,317
Especially considering

705
00:30:17,359 --> 00:30:20,612
you the reason she dead
in the first place.

706
00:30:20,653 --> 00:30:22,864
See now, when she was with me,

707
00:30:22,906 --> 00:30:23,906
she had it made.

708
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,745
Nice cars, jewelry, all the
money she could ask for.

709
00:30:28,787 --> 00:30:30,580
Then when she got with you

710
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:31,873
and joined this church,

711
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:34,459
that's when her
life spiraled down,

712
00:30:35,627 --> 00:30:37,420
giving all her
money to that God.

713
00:30:37,462 --> 00:30:39,798
Well, you know what
the good book says?

714
00:30:39,839 --> 00:30:41,841
It's better to give than
to receive, my brother.

715
00:30:41,883 --> 00:30:43,802
Yeah, well look
where that got her.

716
00:30:43,843 --> 00:30:44,761
(Alex chuckles)

717
00:30:44,803 --> 00:30:46,930
Pooch, you got it all wrong.

718
00:30:48,056 --> 00:30:51,768
When Tanya got with me, her
life changed for the better.

719
00:30:51,810 --> 00:30:53,853
(chuckles) It was
all in God's plan.

720
00:30:53,895 --> 00:30:56,773
See, he allowed her to
get with a scum like you

721
00:30:56,815 --> 00:30:58,024
so when she got with me,

722
00:30:58,066 --> 00:30:59,901
she would know what a
real man looks like.

723
00:31:01,653 --> 00:31:03,822
(Pooch chuckles)

724
00:31:03,863 --> 00:31:04,989
I got you.

725
00:31:07,534 --> 00:31:09,202
You and your goons can leave.

726
00:31:23,925 --> 00:31:27,095
(deep somber music)

727
00:31:58,460 --> 00:31:59,460
Baby.

728
00:32:01,921 --> 00:32:04,049
You haven't said
anything to me all day,

729
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:04,799
and something's gotta give.

730
00:32:04,841 --> 00:32:06,259
I mean, can we talk?

731
00:32:06,301 --> 00:32:08,303
No, Tevin Campbell, we cannot.

732
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,139
We have nothing to talk about.

733
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,017
Oh.

734
00:32:15,101 --> 00:32:16,662
Okay, because I thought
we would want to catch up,

735
00:32:16,686 --> 00:32:20,815
seeing as you haven't talked
to me in a week and a half.

736
00:32:20,857 --> 00:32:22,400
Why should I?

737
00:32:22,442 --> 00:32:24,611
So you can leave the
important stuff out?

738
00:32:26,112 --> 00:32:29,866
No, so that we can
be adults for once.

739
00:32:29,908 --> 00:32:30,950
Yeah, right.

740
00:32:30,992 --> 00:32:33,036
Coming from the
biggest kid I know.

741
00:32:33,995 --> 00:32:38,875
Look, I know how
much you loved Tanya.

742
00:32:38,917 --> 00:32:41,628
Okay? I was just
trying to protect you.

743
00:32:41,670 --> 00:32:42,879
Protect me?

744
00:32:42,921 --> 00:32:43,922
(low tense music)

745
00:32:43,963 --> 00:32:45,340
How?

746
00:32:45,382 --> 00:32:48,468
You were just trying
to protect yourself!

747
00:32:48,510 --> 00:32:49,761
(Angie stammers)

748
00:32:49,803 --> 00:32:50,929
Please, explain,

749
00:32:50,970 --> 00:32:52,406
how in the world were
you protecting me?

750
00:32:52,430 --> 00:32:55,809
Okay, this is a very
high-profile case.

751
00:32:55,850 --> 00:32:57,268
Very high!

752
00:32:57,310 --> 00:33:01,147
This isn't some hit-and-run
or some pickpocketing fiasco.

753
00:33:01,189 --> 00:33:04,025
This man has a
14-person body count!

754
00:33:05,276 --> 00:33:07,320
And unless you want to be 15,

755
00:33:07,362 --> 00:33:09,948
you need to trust my judgment.

756
00:33:09,989 --> 00:33:11,032
Trust?

757
00:33:14,035 --> 00:33:15,453
Let's not,

758
00:33:15,495 --> 00:33:17,914
let's not even talk
about trust right now.

759
00:33:17,956 --> 00:33:19,332
Because you and I both know

760
00:33:19,374 --> 00:33:22,043
that honesty is not exactly
your strong suit now, is it?

761
00:33:22,085 --> 00:33:24,129
(Rashaad chuckles)

762
00:33:24,170 --> 00:33:25,839
So this is what
this is about, huh?

763
00:33:25,880 --> 00:33:28,842
Yes, and you
thought it wasn't?

764
00:33:28,883 --> 00:33:33,013
(chuckles) No, I thought that
I heard that you forgave me.

765
00:33:33,054 --> 00:33:34,472
Forgiven, yes.

766
00:33:34,514 --> 00:33:35,514
Forgotten?

767
00:33:36,433 --> 00:33:37,642
No.

768
00:33:37,684 --> 00:33:38,601
No, well, they both
sound the same to me.

769
00:33:38,643 --> 00:33:39,811
Yeah, right, well,

770
00:33:41,062 --> 00:33:43,273
I guess you need to hear
a little bit better.

771
00:33:43,314 --> 00:33:45,358
Go get your ears checked.

772
00:33:45,400 --> 00:33:46,960
And you know, this
is not the first time

773
00:33:46,985 --> 00:33:48,778
you kept something
major from me.

774
00:33:48,820 --> 00:33:52,449
And every time I think the
last time is the last time,

775
00:33:52,490 --> 00:33:54,409
guess who comes
out with the remix?

776
00:33:58,663 --> 00:34:02,083
You got all those people
at that job fooled,

777
00:34:02,125 --> 00:34:03,752
but I know you
very well, Rashaad.

778
00:34:06,254 --> 00:34:07,630
No, no you don't

779
00:34:07,672 --> 00:34:08,965
because if you knew me at all,

780
00:34:09,007 --> 00:34:11,926
you would know I
was a changed man.

781
00:34:11,968 --> 00:34:14,054
Changed where?

782
00:34:14,095 --> 00:34:16,139
You couldn't change the
tire that's on your car

783
00:34:16,181 --> 00:34:17,181
if you wanted to.

784
00:34:19,517 --> 00:34:20,517
Besides,

785
00:34:21,936 --> 00:34:24,064
I have proof of your infidelity.

786
00:34:24,105 --> 00:34:25,231
(chuckles) No,

787
00:34:25,273 --> 00:34:26,566
you have accusation.

788
00:34:26,608 --> 00:34:28,943
And that's exactly
what you're gonna have

789
00:34:28,985 --> 00:34:30,612
if you keep going like this,

790
00:34:30,653 --> 00:34:31,446
nothing.

791
00:34:31,488 --> 00:34:32,238
Mm-hmm.

792
00:34:32,280 --> 00:34:33,740
You're right. Nothing.

793
00:34:33,782 --> 00:34:36,117
That's what we've had
for the last 10 years.

794
00:34:36,159 --> 00:34:39,287
Ever since you messed it up
with that thing from work!

795
00:34:40,580 --> 00:34:43,124
And it's not my fault that you
haven't been able to fix it.

796
00:34:45,293 --> 00:34:48,421
So will you please
just leave me alone?

797
00:34:48,463 --> 00:34:49,964
Angie.

798
00:34:50,006 --> 00:34:54,219
Angie! (sighs)

799
00:34:56,805 --> 00:35:00,308
(Rashaad exhales sharply)

800
00:35:07,357 --> 00:35:11,027
Ms. Griffin, what exactly
brings you in to see us today?

801
00:35:11,069 --> 00:35:13,947
Well, the other day at
my daughter's funeral-

802
00:35:13,988 --> 00:35:15,657
- Um, homegoing.

803
00:35:15,699 --> 00:35:16,741
I'm sorry?

804
00:35:16,783 --> 00:35:18,952
Um, when believers pass on,

805
00:35:18,993 --> 00:35:20,870
we call it a homegoing,

806
00:35:20,912 --> 00:35:22,122
not a funeral.

807
00:35:22,163 --> 00:35:24,791
The saints, they returned
back to the Father.

808
00:35:24,833 --> 00:35:26,126
And it is my understanding,

809
00:35:26,167 --> 00:35:30,171
although Tanya always went
back and forth with God,

810
00:35:30,213 --> 00:35:32,298
she got it right in
her final moments.

811
00:35:32,340 --> 00:35:34,092
Yeah. Oh, whatever.

812
00:35:34,134 --> 00:35:35,093
I know you told me

813
00:35:35,135 --> 00:35:36,970
that if I ever needed anything,

814
00:35:37,012 --> 00:35:38,179
not to be afraid to ask.

815
00:35:38,221 --> 00:35:40,140
Oh yes, definitely.

816
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:41,349
We're always here to help,

817
00:35:41,391 --> 00:35:44,436
especially for those
who were so generous,

818
00:35:44,477 --> 00:35:47,188
such as Sister Tanya
was to our ministry.

819
00:35:48,189 --> 00:35:51,359
Well, when I heard
you speak on her giving,

820
00:35:52,610 --> 00:35:56,156
I got to thinking about
how much she really gives,

821
00:35:56,197 --> 00:35:59,534
whether it's her
time, her energy,

822
00:36:00,744 --> 00:36:01,744
her money.

823
00:36:02,537 --> 00:36:03,872
Hmm.

824
00:36:03,913 --> 00:36:07,125
I forgot all those countless
days she spent up in here

825
00:36:07,167 --> 00:36:10,962
serving in the food
pantry, the bookstore.

826
00:36:11,004 --> 00:36:12,130
Oh yes,

827
00:36:12,172 --> 00:36:15,008
and I didn't mention
the prison ministry.

828
00:36:15,050 --> 00:36:17,052
(laughs) Oh my goodness,

829
00:36:17,093 --> 00:36:18,887
she was such a blessing.

830
00:36:20,096 --> 00:36:22,223
Her and Alex used
to get up earlier

831
00:36:22,265 --> 00:36:24,768
and minister to the imprisoned.

832
00:36:24,809 --> 00:36:26,936
Always giving from the heart

833
00:36:26,978 --> 00:36:28,646
and never asking for a dime.

834
00:36:28,688 --> 00:36:30,106
I'm asking for it.

835
00:36:30,148 --> 00:36:31,149
Oh?
(low tense music)

836
00:36:31,191 --> 00:36:32,025
Yes.

837
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:33,151
I'm here to collect.

838
00:36:33,193 --> 00:36:34,611
Um, to collect what?

839
00:36:34,652 --> 00:36:36,029
Oh, you know!

840
00:36:36,071 --> 00:36:38,198
All the money you owe her.

841
00:36:38,239 --> 00:36:40,909
You see, my daughter was
not as much a businesswoman

842
00:36:40,950 --> 00:36:42,118
as I am.

843
00:36:42,160 --> 00:36:44,829
That's why you were
able to get over on her,

844
00:36:44,871 --> 00:36:47,415
you'll find up until her death.

845
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,625
Um,

846
00:36:48,667 --> 00:36:49,667
passing.

847
00:36:51,044 --> 00:36:52,087
Excuse me?

848
00:36:52,128 --> 00:36:54,047
Well, again,

849
00:36:54,089 --> 00:36:56,216
believers don't die.

850
00:36:56,257 --> 00:36:58,426
According to John 3:16,

851
00:36:58,468 --> 00:37:01,262
"In him, we have
everlasting life."

852
00:37:01,304 --> 00:37:03,223
We don't, um,

853
00:37:03,264 --> 00:37:05,100
die, we just pass on.
Uh, yeah yeah.

854
00:37:05,141 --> 00:37:06,351
Well, yeah,

855
00:37:07,686 --> 00:37:09,062
as I said,

856
00:37:09,104 --> 00:37:11,189
you'll find, to the exact date,

857
00:37:11,231 --> 00:37:15,318
a list of all the days
she served at the church.

858
00:37:16,736 --> 00:37:17,736
Um...

859
00:37:19,114 --> 00:37:19,989
I'm confused.

860
00:37:20,031 --> 00:37:21,199
Oh, don't be.

861
00:37:21,241 --> 00:37:23,410
Each date is marked to a T

862
00:37:23,451 --> 00:37:25,370
I even highlighted
a couple for you.

863
00:37:27,205 --> 00:37:28,205
Um...

864
00:37:30,250 --> 00:37:31,918
Ms. Griffin, (chuckles)

865
00:37:31,960 --> 00:37:35,171
I think that we might have
some type of misunderstanding.

866
00:37:35,213 --> 00:37:37,716
Here at Fellowship
Christian Church,

867
00:37:37,757 --> 00:37:41,094
we pride ourselves in making
sure that each and every one

868
00:37:41,136 --> 00:37:43,722
of our people are
well taken care of,

869
00:37:43,763 --> 00:37:46,516
whether it's
financially, physically,

870
00:37:46,558 --> 00:37:49,310
and especially spiritually.

871
00:37:49,352 --> 00:37:50,770
[Valerie] Oh, well-

872
00:37:50,812 --> 00:37:53,148
- Our members are in
full understanding

873
00:37:53,189 --> 00:37:56,317
that they served in
a voluntary basis

874
00:37:56,359 --> 00:38:00,155
and that the fruits from
their seeds are sewn

875
00:38:00,196 --> 00:38:03,074
and manifested in heaven.

876
00:38:03,116 --> 00:38:05,118
I do understand.

877
00:38:05,160 --> 00:38:07,746
But I'm not a member,
my daughter was,

878
00:38:07,787 --> 00:38:10,498
even though I begged
her not to join

879
00:38:10,540 --> 00:38:13,293
and waste her time with
all this foolishness,

880
00:38:13,335 --> 00:38:17,630
especially with her mother
being a proud atheist.

881
00:38:17,672 --> 00:38:18,965
Oh yes,

882
00:38:19,007 --> 00:38:20,300
that's right.

883
00:38:20,342 --> 00:38:23,678
I don't even believe in
this so-called God of yours.

884
00:38:25,180 --> 00:38:26,198
I don't know, what time is it?

885
00:38:26,222 --> 00:38:27,366
- Um, this-
- Oh, that's all right,

886
00:38:27,390 --> 00:38:28,558
I gotta go.

887
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,310
Go ahead, look over
those documents.

888
00:38:30,352 --> 00:38:32,812
My QuickPay information is
right at the bottom there.

889
00:38:32,854 --> 00:38:34,230
Oh, and by the way,

890
00:38:34,272 --> 00:38:36,983
as long as you get everything
paid in full by next week,

891
00:38:37,025 --> 00:38:41,321
there'll be no reason for me
to get my legal team involved.

892
00:38:41,363 --> 00:38:43,323
You have been so kind.

893
00:38:43,365 --> 00:38:44,949
Thank you for your time.

894
00:38:44,991 --> 00:38:46,117
You have a wonderful day.

895
00:38:56,961 --> 00:38:58,755
[Jessica] Mrs. Jones.

896
00:38:58,797 --> 00:39:00,090
Yes?

897
00:39:00,131 --> 00:39:01,508
Is your husband around?

898
00:39:03,134 --> 00:39:04,594
Who are you?

899
00:39:04,636 --> 00:39:07,013
I was actually, um, a really
good friend of your cousin's,

900
00:39:07,055 --> 00:39:08,848
and this is my friend Elaine.

901
00:39:08,890 --> 00:39:09,890
We both were.

902
00:39:11,142 --> 00:39:13,329
She's a little too nervous to
come with me today, though.

903
00:39:13,353 --> 00:39:14,979
Um,

904
00:39:15,021 --> 00:39:17,691
anyway, we think we know
who killed your cousin,

905
00:39:17,732 --> 00:39:19,526
and it's not who
everyone thinks it is.

906
00:39:19,567 --> 00:39:21,277
What do you mean?

907
00:39:21,319 --> 00:39:22,737
Listen,

908
00:39:22,779 --> 00:39:23,571
I gotta go.

909
00:39:23,613 --> 00:39:25,031
Both our numbers are on here.

910
00:39:25,073 --> 00:39:26,241
You call me later,

911
00:39:26,282 --> 00:39:27,551
and I'll be able to talk
to you about it then.

912
00:39:27,575 --> 00:39:28,910
Okay?
Uh, wait a minute,

913
00:39:28,952 --> 00:39:31,329
why didn't you just
go to the police?

914
00:39:31,371 --> 00:39:33,415
It's really complicated.

915
00:39:33,456 --> 00:39:35,291
We know how much you
loved your cousin,

916
00:39:35,333 --> 00:39:37,377
and we wanted to tell you first.

917
00:39:37,419 --> 00:39:38,753
I'm sorry, I gotta go.

918
00:39:44,259 --> 00:39:47,721
(deep tense music)

919
00:39:47,762 --> 00:39:50,223
Listen, I don't
know what's going on,

920
00:39:50,265 --> 00:39:55,311
but some strange woman just
rolled up on me on the street

921
00:39:55,353 --> 00:39:57,397
and said that she knows
who really killed Tanya.

922
00:39:57,439 --> 00:39:59,041
[Rashaad] What do you
mean who killed Tanya?

923
00:39:59,065 --> 00:40:00,233
The Jackson Strangler did it.

924
00:40:00,275 --> 00:40:01,067
Are you serious?

925
00:40:01,109 --> 00:40:02,235
Yes!

926
00:40:02,277 --> 00:40:03,486
Now, to be honest,

927
00:40:03,528 --> 00:40:04,362
I thought she was one of
your little girlfriend

928
00:40:04,404 --> 00:40:05,280
at first, but-
See,

929
00:40:05,321 --> 00:40:06,340
see, now you're playing around.

930
00:40:06,364 --> 00:40:07,240
Stop playing.

931
00:40:07,282 --> 00:40:08,575
I'm being serious. Come on!

932
00:40:08,616 --> 00:40:10,136
[Rashaad] Okay, what
exactly is she saying?

933
00:40:10,160 --> 00:40:12,370
Did she even mention the
Jackson Strangler at all?

934
00:40:12,412 --> 00:40:14,622
Well, she says she
doesn't even think

935
00:40:14,664 --> 00:40:16,750
the Jackson Strangler had
anything to do with it.

936
00:40:16,791 --> 00:40:18,501
[Rashaad] What?
Are you serious?

937
00:40:18,543 --> 00:40:19,419
That's ridiculous.

938
00:40:19,461 --> 00:40:20,604
He had everything to do with it.

939
00:40:20,628 --> 00:40:21,546
Who else could it be?

940
00:40:21,588 --> 00:40:23,048
That's what the woman said.

941
00:40:23,089 --> 00:40:24,275
[Rashaad] Okay, someone
like her is pretty dangerous

942
00:40:24,299 --> 00:40:25,383
by herself.

943
00:40:25,425 --> 00:40:26,777
We better put her in
witness protection

944
00:40:26,801 --> 00:40:28,762
before she ends up dead too.

945
00:40:28,803 --> 00:40:31,431
Okay, well, she did
give me her number,

946
00:40:31,473 --> 00:40:33,016
so I'll text it to you.

947
00:40:33,058 --> 00:40:36,227
[Rashaad] Yes, text
it to me right away.

948
00:40:36,269 --> 00:40:38,271
And hey, stay safe out here.

949
00:40:38,313 --> 00:40:39,272

950
00:40:39,314 --> 00:40:40,565

I want the truth.

from my husband.

accept what you want to hear

to accept the truth.

You're immature. All right?

994
00:42:43,521 --> 00:42:44,397
I mean, look at
how you're acting.

995
00:42:44,439 --> 00:42:45,440

anymore at all.

1004

00:43:04,000 --> 00:43:05,585
It's called a
woman that's scorned.

1006
00:43:05,627 --> 00:43:06,937
No, it's called a
woman that's selfish.

00:43:06,961 --> 00:43:09,714
H-how am I selfish, Rashaad?

1008
00:43:09,756 --> 00:43:12,217
Because I want my
husband all to myself

1009
00:43:12,258 --> 00:43:15,261
and not sharing him with half
of the women in the city?

1010
00:43:15,303 --> 00:43:16,096
It ain't half!

00:43:16,137 --> 00:43:17,137

00:43:27,482 --> 00:43:32,487

- Oh. (stammers)

00:46:14,649 --> 00:46:17,277
while I finished
packing his stuff.

1085
00:46:17,318 --> 00:46:18,318
Oh wait!

1086
00:46:19,779 --> 00:46:23,283
(Angie sighs)

1087
00:46:23,324 --> 00:46:24,324
Baby,

1088
00:46:25,618 --> 00:46:28,747
those are the
divorce papers, okay?

1089
00:46:28,788 --> 00:46:30,915
Make sure you sign
them when you wake up.

1090
00:46:32,500 --> 00:46:33,918
Get him outta here.

1091
00:46:33,960 --> 00:46:35,295
[Jarvis] All right, let's go.

1092
00:46:35,337 --> 00:46:38,423
(deep dramatic music)

1093
00:46:43,720 --> 00:46:44,804
Live from Channel 10,

1094
00:46:44,846 --> 00:46:46,282
we're bringing you
the latest details

1095
00:46:46,306 --> 00:46:48,808
on the disappearance
of the mother of three,

1096
00:46:48,850 --> 00:46:50,101
Jessica Turner.

1097
00:46:50,143 --> 00:46:52,062
Police say that
she was found dead

1098
00:46:52,103 --> 00:46:54,314
just two and a half
miles from her residence.

1099
00:46:54,356 --> 00:46:56,733
Now, if you're not familiar
with who this woman is,

1100
00:46:56,775 --> 00:46:58,151
let me catch you up.

1101
00:46:58,193 --> 00:47:01,029
Jessica is a key witness to
the Jackson Strangler murder

1102
00:47:01,071 --> 00:47:03,114
and also has information
on the death of her friend,

1103
00:47:03,156 --> 00:47:04,366
who's also a key witness.

1104
00:47:04,407 --> 00:47:06,493
Now, with Jessica, there
is foul play involved,

1105
00:47:06,534 --> 00:47:09,329
and the autopsy reports are
waiting to be confirmed.

1106
00:47:09,371 --> 00:47:11,664
If you have any information
about this case,

1107
00:47:11,706 --> 00:47:15,001
please contact your local
authorities as soon as possible.

1108
00:47:15,043 --> 00:47:16,211
I'm Michelle Mitchell,

1109
00:47:16,252 --> 00:47:18,380
and you're watching
Channel 10 News.

1110
00:47:19,673 --> 00:47:23,051
(tense unsettling music)

1111
00:47:48,702 --> 00:47:49,911
Hey.

1112
00:47:49,953 --> 00:47:51,472
[Elaine] Hey, you hear
about what happened?

1113
00:47:51,496 --> 00:47:52,914
Yeah, I just saw the news.

1114
00:47:52,956 --> 00:47:54,725
[Elaine] Look, I'm just
trying to keep it all together.

1115
00:47:54,749 --> 00:47:55,851
It's just so much, you know.

1116
00:47:55,875 --> 00:47:57,043
I'm so sorry.

1117
00:47:57,085 --> 00:47:58,396
[Elaine] I'm so
sorry for tearing up.

1118
00:47:58,420 --> 00:47:59,504
No, no, no,

1119
00:47:59,546 --> 00:48:01,172
don't apologize for crying.

1120
00:48:01,214 --> 00:48:02,549
- Look,
- It was your friend.

1121
00:48:02,590 --> 00:48:04,801
[Elaine] if there's
anything I can do to help out,

1122
00:48:04,843 --> 00:48:06,052
an end to this.

1123
00:48:06,094 --> 00:48:07,846
I'm just so tired of
murders, you know.

1124
00:48:07,887 --> 00:48:10,098
I just want-
Listen.

1125
00:48:10,140 --> 00:48:12,892
We need to talk, face-to-face.

1126
00:48:12,934 --> 00:48:14,078
[Elaine] As a matter of fact,

1127
00:48:14,102 --> 00:48:15,895
I have an idea of
what's going on here.

1128
00:48:15,937 --> 00:48:17,564
I was thinking the same thing.

1129
00:48:17,605 --> 00:48:20,859
[Elaine] Can you have your
husband meet me at the station?

1130
00:48:20,900 --> 00:48:21,776
Yeah.

1131
00:48:21,818 --> 00:48:22,777
[Elaine] I'm ready to talk.

1132
00:48:22,819 --> 00:48:24,320
Okay.

1133
00:48:24,362 --> 00:48:26,382
[Elaine] Please, have him
meet me as soon as possible.

1134
00:48:26,406 --> 00:48:27,157
Okay.

1135
00:48:27,198 --> 00:48:28,950
[Elaine] Okay. Goodbye.

1136
00:48:32,454 --> 00:48:34,706
(tense dramatic music)

1137
00:48:34,748 --> 00:48:37,834
(Rashaad coughs)

1138
00:48:37,876 --> 00:48:38,960
Rough night?

1139
00:48:40,837 --> 00:48:45,633
You could say that.

1140
00:48:46,843 --> 00:48:49,387
So I understand you were
the last person to talk

1141
00:48:49,429 --> 00:48:50,221
to Ms. Griffin.

1142
00:48:50,263 --> 00:48:51,681
Yes.

1143
00:48:51,723 --> 00:48:55,310
It wasn't exactly the greatest
experience, but, of course,

1144
00:48:55,352 --> 00:48:58,063
I am one to believe that
everything happens for a reason.

1145
00:48:58,104 --> 00:48:59,939
(Rashaad laughs)

1146
00:48:59,981 --> 00:49:01,441
Yeah, that's what they say.

1147
00:49:01,483 --> 00:49:04,861
I just wish I understood
the reason for this one.

1148
00:49:04,903 --> 00:49:06,946
Maybe I could have done more.

1149
00:49:06,988 --> 00:49:08,406
Tell me more.

1150
00:49:08,448 --> 00:49:11,034
You want the long version
or the short version?

1151
00:49:11,076 --> 00:49:14,120
(scoffs lightly)
Well, whatever.

1152
00:49:14,162 --> 00:49:16,039
I got water, I'm good.

1153
00:49:16,873 --> 00:49:18,875
Well, Tanya,

1154
00:49:18,917 --> 00:49:20,794
she always had a
thing for married men.

1155
00:49:20,835 --> 00:49:21,795
Really?

1156
00:49:21,836 --> 00:49:23,046
Yeah.

1157
00:49:23,088 --> 00:49:25,298
I don't know if it was,
like, obsession or what,

1158
00:49:25,340 --> 00:49:28,802
but she always talked about
it like a fantasy, you know?

1159
00:49:28,843 --> 00:49:31,221
Then, one day about
nine years ago,

1160
00:49:31,262 --> 00:49:33,098
she put it into action.

1161
00:49:33,139 --> 00:49:34,057
They met at a club,

1162
00:49:34,099 --> 00:49:35,934
- Mm.
- Had drinks,

1163
00:49:35,975 --> 00:49:37,102
exchanged numbers,

1164
00:49:37,811 --> 00:49:39,896
now the rest is in the air.

1165
00:49:39,938 --> 00:49:41,022
Nine years later,

1166
00:49:41,064 --> 00:49:42,941
a couple STDs,

1167
00:49:42,982 --> 00:49:44,150
two kids.

1168
00:49:44,192 --> 00:49:46,528
So, no divorce?

1169
00:49:46,569 --> 00:49:47,821
Right.

1170
00:49:47,862 --> 00:49:50,782
My girl always fell
for the okie dokie.

1171
00:49:50,824 --> 00:49:52,176
He always promised
to leave his wife,

1172
00:49:52,200 --> 00:49:53,910
but he never did.

1173
00:49:53,952 --> 00:49:55,203
Okay, (sighs)

1174
00:49:55,245 --> 00:49:57,747
but what does this have to
do with the other night?

1175
00:49:57,789 --> 00:49:58,998
A lot.

1176
00:49:59,040 --> 00:50:01,001
You see, she had met
this new guy, Alex,

1177
00:50:01,042 --> 00:50:02,127
a good man.

1178
00:50:02,168 --> 00:50:04,921
Worked 9-to-5, church guy.

1179
00:50:04,963 --> 00:50:06,423
They hit it off quickly,

1180
00:50:06,464 --> 00:50:08,818
and she was finally starting
to leave Mr. Married Man alone.

1181
00:50:08,842 --> 00:50:09,926
Mm-hmm.

1182
00:50:09,968 --> 00:50:11,177
That night,

1183
00:50:11,219 --> 00:50:13,513
she had to see him one
last time to cut all ties.

1184
00:50:14,723 --> 00:50:16,850
She had been hinting at
telling his wife everything.

1185
00:50:16,891 --> 00:50:19,019
You know, since she
changed her life,

1186
00:50:19,060 --> 00:50:21,062
she wanted to make
everything good.

1187
00:50:21,104 --> 00:50:24,649
So how did you feel about
her dating married guys?

1188
00:50:24,691 --> 00:50:25,692
I hated it.

1189
00:50:25,734 --> 00:50:26,609
Ah?
(low intense music)

1190
00:50:26,651 --> 00:50:28,028
I knew she deserved better.

1191
00:50:28,069 --> 00:50:29,213
She knew she deserved better.

1192
00:50:29,237 --> 00:50:31,656
Well, did you ever
express that to her?

1193
00:50:31,698 --> 00:50:33,033
Absolutely.

1194
00:50:33,074 --> 00:50:36,828
Plenty of times, but never
really ended too well.

1195
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:41,374
(thumping dance music)
(Tanya laughing)

1196
00:50:41,416 --> 00:50:43,710
Girl, when do you
get enough of this?

1197
00:50:43,752 --> 00:50:45,712
Girl, enough of what?

1198
00:50:45,754 --> 00:50:46,963
Being that man's secret.

1199
00:50:47,005 --> 00:50:48,590
(Tanya laughs)

1200
00:50:48,631 --> 00:50:49,924
Girl, bye.

1201
00:50:49,966 --> 00:50:52,510
What she doesn't
know won't hurt her.

1202
00:50:52,552 --> 00:50:55,055
But it will
eventually hurt you.

1203
00:50:55,096 --> 00:50:55,972
(laughs) Girl,

1204
00:50:56,014 --> 00:50:58,266
I am in love.

1205
00:50:58,308 --> 00:51:00,560
You do remember what
that feels like, right?

1206
00:51:00,602 --> 00:51:03,355
Or have you been single
for so long you forgot?

1207
00:51:04,814 --> 00:51:06,066
No.

1208
00:51:06,107 --> 00:51:09,152
I'm waiting on God
to send my husband,

1209
00:51:09,194 --> 00:51:11,154
rather than take someone else's.

1210
00:51:12,530 --> 00:51:13,530
I'm waiting.

1211
00:51:14,491 --> 00:51:17,077
You do remember what
that feels like, right?

1212
00:51:17,118 --> 00:51:18,453
What?

1213
00:51:18,495 --> 00:51:19,662
Waiting.

1214
00:51:19,704 --> 00:51:22,874
Or have you been easy
for too long you forgot?

1215
00:51:22,916 --> 00:51:25,168
(Tanya laughs)

1216
00:51:25,210 --> 00:51:27,587
This is why we wear these,

1217
00:51:27,629 --> 00:51:30,674
to remind ourselves
what we're waiting for.

1218
00:51:30,715 --> 00:51:32,050
Girl, whatever.

1219
00:51:32,092 --> 00:51:33,718
He's my sons' father.

1220
00:51:33,760 --> 00:51:36,262
No, he's their mother's trap.

1221
00:51:36,304 --> 00:51:38,098
And I promise you,

1222
00:51:38,139 --> 00:51:40,684
if you don't let Christ
free you from that snare,

1223
00:51:40,725 --> 00:51:42,227
the only end will be death.

1224
00:51:44,270 --> 00:51:45,939
Is that a threat?

1225
00:51:45,980 --> 00:51:47,941
No. That's a prophecy.

1226
00:51:47,982 --> 00:51:50,026
And you better take your heed.

1227
00:51:50,068 --> 00:51:52,404
Your kids don't even
know who their daddy is.

1228
00:51:55,448 --> 00:51:56,741
[Tanya] What do you know?

1229
00:51:56,783 --> 00:51:57,783
I know enough.

1230
00:52:00,954 --> 00:52:02,038
(Rashaad sighs heavily)

1231
00:52:02,080 --> 00:52:03,080
Wow.

1232
00:52:05,917 --> 00:52:07,335
Kids never knew their father?

1233
00:52:08,670 --> 00:52:10,171
Mm, that's cold-blooded.

1234
00:52:11,006 --> 00:52:12,173
Yikes.

1235
00:52:14,009 --> 00:52:16,094
(Rashaad moans)

1236
00:52:16,136 --> 00:52:17,721
What's wrong?

1237
00:52:17,762 --> 00:52:19,139
I just...

1238
00:52:19,180 --> 00:52:21,307
I-I hate guys like that.

1239
00:52:25,270 --> 00:52:26,855
Sounds like a POI.

1240
00:52:27,731 --> 00:52:29,024
POI?

1241
00:52:29,065 --> 00:52:30,191
Person of interest.

1242
00:52:31,026 --> 00:52:32,444
You think so?

1243
00:52:32,485 --> 00:52:34,821
I mean, yeah, man
cheating on his wife?

1244
00:52:34,863 --> 00:52:37,490
You know, sounds like
highlights from my life.

1245
00:52:37,532 --> 00:52:39,784
I mean, except for
the kids, you know.

1246
00:52:39,826 --> 00:52:42,120
My wife didn't want
'em, I didn't either.

1247
00:52:42,162 --> 00:52:44,205
Um, it's a typical case.

1248
00:52:45,081 --> 00:52:47,792
Guy wants to whack
off his side piece

1249
00:52:47,834 --> 00:52:50,086
just to get a clean slate.

1250
00:52:50,128 --> 00:52:51,129
Wow.

1251
00:52:51,171 --> 00:52:52,255
I never thought of that.

1252
00:52:52,297 --> 00:52:54,716
You don't get paid to think.

1253
00:52:54,758 --> 00:52:55,758
I do.

1254
00:52:56,551 --> 00:52:58,178
Do you have a
description on this guy?

1255
00:52:58,219 --> 00:52:59,219
I don't.

1256
00:52:59,846 --> 00:53:01,181
Wait. (scoffs)

1257
00:53:01,222 --> 00:53:03,683
What? You said they were
together for nine years.

1258
00:53:03,725 --> 00:53:06,353
Yeah, she was, not me.

1259
00:53:06,394 --> 00:53:07,812
I never even seen the guy.

1260
00:53:09,064 --> 00:53:10,249
I wouldn't have even
thought he was real

1261
00:53:10,273 --> 00:53:12,359
if it wasn't for the kids.

1262
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:14,361
That's the thing with Tanya.

1263
00:53:14,402 --> 00:53:17,155
She kept this man top secret.

1264
00:53:17,197 --> 00:53:18,948
Victoria's Secret classified,

1265
00:53:18,990 --> 00:53:19,783
if you know what I mean.

1266
00:53:19,824 --> 00:53:21,034
Hmm.

1267
00:53:21,076 --> 00:53:23,036
Well, did you ever
meet the "nice guy"?

1268
00:53:23,078 --> 00:53:24,037
Alex?

1269
00:53:24,079 --> 00:53:25,288
Of course.

1270
00:53:26,623 --> 00:53:29,417
Every Sunday, we all went
to the same church, and...

1271
00:53:29,459 --> 00:53:32,212
Well, I mean, me and Alex did.

1272
00:53:32,253 --> 00:53:33,880
And then, one day,
he ran into her,

1273
00:53:33,922 --> 00:53:37,884
and they clicked, and she started
coming to church with him.

1274
00:53:37,926 --> 00:53:39,260
(Elaine chuckles)

1275
00:53:39,302 --> 00:53:42,305
It's kind of funny
how it all worked out.

1276
00:53:42,347 --> 00:53:44,224
Like the Word says,

1277
00:53:44,265 --> 00:53:45,266
some plant,

1278
00:53:46,101 --> 00:53:47,769
others water,

1279
00:53:47,811 --> 00:53:50,021
but God gives the increase.

1280
00:53:51,272 --> 00:53:52,440
I was planting.

1281
00:53:53,233 --> 00:53:54,859
Alex was watering.

1282
00:53:54,901 --> 00:53:57,862
(deep hip hop music)

1283
00:53:59,864 --> 00:54:02,575
Hey, let me holler at you.

1284
00:54:03,368 --> 00:54:04,786
Boy, bye.

1285
00:54:04,828 --> 00:54:05,912
I got a man.

1286
00:54:05,954 --> 00:54:08,331
First of all, I didn't
even ask you that.

1287
00:54:08,373 --> 00:54:10,083
So what you want?

1288
00:54:10,125 --> 00:54:11,584
(Alex laughs)

1289
00:54:11,626 --> 00:54:13,044
Look at you.

1290
00:54:13,086 --> 00:54:15,714
You so used to someone trying
to take something from you,

1291
00:54:15,755 --> 00:54:19,259
you're not used to a brother
trying to give you something.

1292
00:54:19,300 --> 00:54:21,302
And what is it that
you want to give me?

1293
00:54:22,345 --> 00:54:23,888
My number.

1294
00:54:23,930 --> 00:54:25,807
(scoffs) Boy, bye.

1295
00:54:25,849 --> 00:54:26,975
I do not have time for this.

1296
00:54:27,017 --> 00:54:27,934
No, no, no, no,
I'm, I'm just joking.

1297
00:54:27,976 --> 00:54:29,227
I'm just joking.

1298
00:54:29,269 --> 00:54:31,104
I'm just joking.

1299
00:54:31,146 --> 00:54:32,164
Unless you really want it.

1300
00:54:32,188 --> 00:54:33,273
See?

1301
00:54:33,314 --> 00:54:34,107
(laughs) No, for real though.

1302
00:54:34,149 --> 00:54:35,316
For real, for real.

1303
00:54:35,358 --> 00:54:37,485
My church is a
couple of blocks up.

1304
00:54:37,527 --> 00:54:39,863
You should pop in
on us one Sunday.

1305
00:54:39,904 --> 00:54:41,281
No, I'm good.

1306
00:54:41,322 --> 00:54:42,657
Come on, it'll
be good for you.

1307
00:54:42,699 --> 00:54:46,578
Look, I ain't been to church
since I was, like, five.

1308
00:54:46,619 --> 00:54:48,246
I doubt I got anything to wear.

1309
00:54:48,288 --> 00:54:49,914
I gotta go.

1310
00:54:49,956 --> 00:54:51,416
Can I at least get your name?

1311
00:54:53,209 --> 00:54:54,270
Well, I guess
she saw him again,

1312
00:54:54,294 --> 00:54:55,462
and he kept asking,

1313
00:54:55,503 --> 00:54:57,172
and one thing led to another,

1314
00:54:57,213 --> 00:54:59,924
and next thing you know,
they were like glue.

1315
00:55:01,259 --> 00:55:02,969
You never saw one
without the other.

1316
00:55:04,179 --> 00:55:05,388
(Tanya sighs)

1317
00:55:05,430 --> 00:55:09,184
So, what are we calling this?

1318
00:55:09,225 --> 00:55:10,143
(chuckles) What?

1319
00:55:10,185 --> 00:55:11,227
This.

1320
00:55:11,269 --> 00:55:13,313
Us. (chuckles)

1321
00:55:13,355 --> 00:55:14,939
What are we, uh,

1322
00:55:14,981 --> 00:55:16,149
what, are we dating?

1323
00:55:16,191 --> 00:55:17,067
(Alex laughs)

1324
00:55:17,108 --> 00:55:18,108
Nah.

1325
00:55:19,235 --> 00:55:20,362
See, a real man?

1326
00:55:21,279 --> 00:55:22,530
A real man don't date.

1327
00:55:23,656 --> 00:55:24,656
He courts.

1328
00:55:25,700 --> 00:55:26,826
Oh.

1329
00:55:26,868 --> 00:55:27,535
Well, then I guess
you consider yourself

1330
00:55:27,577 --> 00:55:29,037
to be a real man then?

1331
00:55:29,079 --> 00:55:30,079
Well, yeah.

1332
00:55:31,456 --> 00:55:33,667
Tanya, when you think of a date,

1333
00:55:33,708 --> 00:55:37,087
you think of the
calendar, right?

1334
00:55:37,128 --> 00:55:38,338
Yeah.

1335
00:55:38,380 --> 00:55:41,341
Okay, and if there's
something on that date

1336
00:55:41,383 --> 00:55:42,485
that doesn't fit your schedule,

1337
00:55:42,509 --> 00:55:44,052
what do you do?

1338
00:55:44,094 --> 00:55:45,363
You try to find one that does.

1339
00:55:45,387 --> 00:55:47,555
Exactly. You
adjust your schedule.

1340
00:55:49,265 --> 00:55:52,477
Tanya, I don't have
to adjust my schedule

1341
00:55:52,519 --> 00:55:53,687
because I found you.

1342
00:55:55,397 --> 00:55:56,398
That's deep.

1343
00:55:57,273 --> 00:55:58,942
No, baby girl,

1344
00:55:58,983 --> 00:55:59,983
that's favor.

1345
00:56:03,154 --> 00:56:04,154
Tell me something.

1346
00:56:05,240 --> 00:56:07,367
What is it that you see in me?

1347
00:56:07,409 --> 00:56:08,660
Hmm. Honestly?

1348
00:56:10,078 --> 00:56:12,372
I see a sweet,

1349
00:56:12,414 --> 00:56:13,832
beautiful,

1350
00:56:13,873 --> 00:56:15,250
intelligent,

1351
00:56:15,291 --> 00:56:16,376
and wonderful woman of God.

1352
00:56:16,418 --> 00:56:18,294
(Tanya laughs)

1353
00:56:18,336 --> 00:56:20,296
She's laughing at me. (laughs)

1354
00:56:20,338 --> 00:56:21,214
What's funny?

1355
00:56:21,256 --> 00:56:22,256
It's just...

1356
00:56:23,008 --> 00:56:24,217
That's not what I see

1357
00:56:24,259 --> 00:56:26,302
when I look at
myself in the mirror.

1358
00:56:26,344 --> 00:56:27,303
Really?

1359
00:56:27,345 --> 00:56:28,345
No.

1360
00:56:29,264 --> 00:56:32,267
You see, I see a
woman that's broken,

1361
00:56:32,308 --> 00:56:33,435
torn,

1362
00:56:34,227 --> 00:56:35,227
not worthy.

1363
00:56:36,187 --> 00:56:37,187
Plus,

1364
00:56:38,440 --> 00:56:39,607
I have a past.

1365
00:56:39,649 --> 00:56:41,443
It's time you
forget about the past.

1366
00:56:42,944 --> 00:56:44,904
You know the story
of Hosea and Gomer?

1367
00:56:44,946 --> 00:56:48,700
(chuckles) I told you I
needed to brush up on my Bible.

1368
00:56:48,742 --> 00:56:50,744
Well, let me enlighten you.

1369
00:56:50,785 --> 00:56:53,830
You see, um, Gomer
knew a lot of men,

1370
00:56:54,956 --> 00:56:56,791
but Hosea had
married her anyway.

1371
00:57:00,128 --> 00:57:02,255
He accepted her for her.

1372
00:57:02,297 --> 00:57:03,590
He forgot about her past.

1373
00:57:05,425 --> 00:57:08,428
When a man loves a woman,

1374
00:57:08,470 --> 00:57:09,929
I mean truly loves a woman,

1375
00:57:11,723 --> 00:57:15,352
there's nothing he
won't do to be with her

1376
00:57:15,393 --> 00:57:16,603
and only her.

1377
00:57:18,688 --> 00:57:21,441
Can I be desperately
honest with you?

1378
00:57:21,483 --> 00:57:23,068
I wouldn't have
it any other way.

1379
00:57:25,612 --> 00:57:27,447
I know we've been
talking for a few weeks,

1380
00:57:27,489 --> 00:57:30,617
and I like you, I really do.

1381
00:57:30,658 --> 00:57:32,452
I mean, you're really dope,

1382
00:57:32,494 --> 00:57:34,412
(laughs) but-

1383
00:57:34,454 --> 00:57:36,664
- You're seeing
someone else, right?

1384
00:57:40,126 --> 00:57:41,294
Yeah.

1385
00:57:41,336 --> 00:57:42,545
Tanya, I'm not stupid.

1386
00:57:44,089 --> 00:57:45,423
So what, you stalking me?

1387
00:57:45,465 --> 00:57:47,842
Well, not stalking
you exactly.

1388
00:57:47,884 --> 00:57:50,053
But I have seen him
around with his wife.

1389
00:57:51,137 --> 00:57:53,515
You realize that's not who
God has for you, right?

1390
00:57:56,059 --> 00:57:57,394
Look,

1391
00:57:57,435 --> 00:57:58,579
he says he's gonna leave her.

1392
00:57:58,603 --> 00:57:59,396
(laughs) Yeah.

1393
00:57:59,437 --> 00:58:00,605
And you believe that?

1394
00:58:02,148 --> 00:58:04,109
Look, all I'm saying is this,

1395
00:58:05,193 --> 00:58:07,987
pay attention to what's
right here in front of you,

1396
00:58:08,029 --> 00:58:09,029
right now.

1397
00:58:10,365 --> 00:58:11,365
Okay?

1398
00:58:13,785 --> 00:58:15,995
All right, well, hey, let's eat.

1399
00:58:16,037 --> 00:58:17,330
We got a picnic, right?

1400
00:58:17,372 --> 00:58:19,874
So I assume the two of
them still stayed together?

1401
00:58:19,916 --> 00:58:21,001
Well, yeah.

1402
00:58:21,042 --> 00:58:23,003
I mean, Poochie had
a problem with it.

1403
00:58:23,044 --> 00:58:23,670
Poochie?

1404
00:58:23,712 --> 00:58:25,547
Wait, who's Poochie?

1405
00:58:26,297 --> 00:58:27,674
Granny, I'm hungry.

1406
00:58:27,716 --> 00:58:29,527
Okay, let's see what they
have over here for us, okay?

1407
00:58:29,551 --> 00:58:30,551
Okay.

1408
00:58:31,720 --> 00:58:33,013
Thank you, ma'am.

1409
00:58:33,054 --> 00:58:34,448
Really do appreciate
what you're doing

1410
00:58:34,472 --> 00:58:35,682
for the community here.

1411
00:58:35,724 --> 00:58:37,058
Yeah, we appreciate it.

1412
00:58:37,100 --> 00:58:38,143
Thank you.
God bless you.

1413
00:58:38,184 --> 00:58:39,644
Thank you so much.

1414
00:58:39,686 --> 00:58:41,580
You know, this is exactly what
we need in this neighborhood,

1415
00:58:41,604 --> 00:58:43,064
people that actually care.

1416
00:58:43,106 --> 00:58:45,525
Not like these low-life that's
passing around this poison

1417
00:58:45,567 --> 00:58:46,860
to our babies.

1418
00:58:46,901 --> 00:58:48,546
Well, the Lord provides,
doesn't he, Mrs. Gunther?

1419
00:58:48,570 --> 00:58:49,362
Yes, he does.

1420
00:58:49,404 --> 00:58:50,655
He does more as well.

1421
00:58:50,697 --> 00:58:53,199
He provides, he guides,
and he keeps us.

1422
00:58:53,241 --> 00:58:54,534
He's a good God. Yes.

1423
00:58:54,576 --> 00:58:55,678
- That's right.
- He's a good God.

1424
00:58:55,702 --> 00:58:56,870
- That's right.
- Amen, yes.

1425
00:58:56,911 --> 00:58:58,079
(Alex chuckles)

1426
00:58:58,121 --> 00:58:59,140
All right, y'all keep
doing what you're doing,

1427
00:58:59,164 --> 00:59:00,373
all right?
We will.

1428
00:59:00,415 --> 00:59:01,895
- We will.
- All right. Come on, baby.

1429
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:05,045
You know what, baby?

1430
00:59:05,086 --> 00:59:06,463
I'm gonna go inside

1431
00:59:06,504 --> 00:59:07,690
and see if there's some more
juices and water, all right?

1432
00:59:07,714 --> 00:59:08,733
- All right, baby.
- Okay? You good?

1433
00:59:08,757 --> 00:59:09,817
- I'm good. I'm great.
- Fellas,

1434
00:59:09,841 --> 00:59:11,509
hey, hey, watch your mama.

1435
00:59:11,551 --> 00:59:12,594
- A'ight.
- Watch her.

1436
00:59:14,137 --> 00:59:15,889
Hey yo, Slim?

1437
00:59:15,930 --> 00:59:17,182
Slim!

1438
00:59:17,223 --> 00:59:18,223
Come here.

1439
00:59:19,642 --> 00:59:21,686
What do you want, Poochie?

1440
00:59:21,728 --> 00:59:22,604
Man, that's how you greet me?

1441
00:59:22,645 --> 00:59:24,522
What you want me to call you?

1442
00:59:24,564 --> 00:59:25,732
My baby daddy?

1443
00:59:27,442 --> 00:59:28,568
(Tanya laughs)

1444
00:59:28,610 --> 00:59:29,778
My bad.

1445
00:59:29,819 --> 00:59:31,946
Were we still keeping
that our little secret?

1446
00:59:31,988 --> 00:59:34,824
Or did your wife finally
put two and two together?

1447
00:59:34,866 --> 00:59:38,286
You know, it's only
been, what, nine years?

1448
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,081
I think it's about
time she knows.

1449
00:59:41,122 --> 00:59:42,540
Don't you think?

1450
00:59:42,582 --> 00:59:43,458
You better not.

1451
00:59:43,500 --> 00:59:44,626
(laughs) Well, why not?

1452
00:59:45,669 --> 00:59:46,670
You know,

1453
00:59:48,004 --> 00:59:50,048
you didn't send your
drop off guys this month

1454
00:59:50,090 --> 00:59:51,090
to keep it quiet.

1455
00:59:52,384 --> 00:59:55,387
I thought that was a sign that
you were ready to come clean,

1456
00:59:55,428 --> 00:59:56,638
dirty.

1457
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:58,515
My money been kind of tight.

1458
00:59:58,556 --> 00:59:59,556
Really?

1459
01:00:00,517 --> 01:00:01,702
Well, I wonder how
tight it's gonna be

1460
01:00:01,726 --> 01:00:03,645
when your wife
finds out about us.

1461
01:00:04,854 --> 01:00:08,316
You know, them attorney
fees can get real hefty.

1462
01:00:08,358 --> 01:00:11,861
Then when I come forward,
it's like a domino effect.

1463
01:00:11,903 --> 01:00:14,030
All your other baby mamas, gone.

1464
01:00:14,072 --> 01:00:15,299
Listen here.
(deep ominous music)

1465
01:00:15,323 --> 01:00:17,450
You ever wonder why
they call me Poochie?

1466
01:00:17,492 --> 01:00:18,827
Hm?

1467
01:00:18,868 --> 01:00:22,205
'Cause that's the name of
the guy that killed my mama.

1468
01:00:22,247 --> 01:00:23,998
Real cool, easy-going,

1469
01:00:25,750 --> 01:00:27,085
'til you mess with him.

1470
01:00:27,836 --> 01:00:29,212
Then people end up dead.

1471
01:00:30,880 --> 01:00:32,757
(chuckles) See,
I'm just like him.

1472
01:00:34,551 --> 01:00:36,845
See, on the streets,
they called him Poochie,

1473
01:00:37,846 --> 01:00:40,306
but at home, we
called him Daddy.

1474
01:00:40,348 --> 01:00:43,685
I got no problem taking
my baby mama out either.

1475
01:00:45,937 --> 01:00:47,439
Boys!

1476
01:00:47,480 --> 01:00:48,648
Boys!
Tanya!

1477
01:00:48,690 --> 01:00:49,315
What are you doing?
Yes, ma'am?

1478
01:00:49,357 --> 01:00:50,357
Come here.

1479
01:00:53,570 --> 01:00:55,238
There's somebody I
want you to meet.

1480
01:00:57,532 --> 01:00:59,576
This is Mr. Edwards.

1481
01:00:59,617 --> 01:01:01,828
He's your mom's good friend.

1482
01:01:01,870 --> 01:01:03,329
Say hi.
What's up?

1483
01:01:03,371 --> 01:01:05,498
- Hey.
- How you doing?

1484
01:01:05,540 --> 01:01:06,332
Hey, mister.

1485
01:01:06,374 --> 01:01:07,208
Hm?

1486
01:01:07,250 --> 01:01:08,668
What do you know,

1487
01:01:08,710 --> 01:01:10,503
we got the same last name.

1488
01:01:10,545 --> 01:01:11,338
(Pooch chuckles)

1489
01:01:11,379 --> 01:01:12,589
Nice car.

1490
01:01:12,630 --> 01:01:14,090
Yeah?

1491
01:01:14,132 --> 01:01:16,426
Maybe your daddy'll buy one
just like it for you one day.

1492
01:01:19,679 --> 01:01:21,181
Sir,

1493
01:01:21,222 --> 01:01:22,640
we don't have a daddy.

1494
01:01:22,682 --> 01:01:23,892
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,

1495
01:01:24,893 --> 01:01:26,519
what'd I tell you
about that, huh?

1496
01:01:26,561 --> 01:01:28,646
Don't ever say you
ain't got no daddy.

1497
01:01:28,688 --> 01:01:30,440
Okay?

1498
01:01:30,482 --> 01:01:31,358
What'd I tell you?

1499
01:01:31,399 --> 01:01:32,734
He's just like the devil, right?

1500
01:01:33,902 --> 01:01:35,028
He's always there,

1501
01:01:36,404 --> 01:01:37,864
even if you don't see him.

1502
01:01:39,657 --> 01:01:41,117
Hey, baby!

1503
01:01:41,159 --> 01:01:42,159
Hey, um,

1504
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:46,289
we didn't have any more
juice or water, okay?

1505
01:01:46,331 --> 01:01:47,582
But we got a bunch of chips.

1506
01:01:47,624 --> 01:01:48,708
(Alex laughs)

1507
01:01:48,750 --> 01:01:50,543
Who's this?

1508
01:01:50,585 --> 01:01:53,588
This is, um, (clears throat)

1509
01:01:53,630 --> 01:01:54,756
this is him.

1510
01:01:55,507 --> 01:01:56,507
- Him?
- Him.

1511
01:01:57,592 --> 01:01:59,719
Oh! (clears throat)

1512
01:01:59,761 --> 01:02:01,388
Him! Okay, okay.

1513
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:03,347
How's it going?

1514
01:02:04,224 --> 01:02:05,850
All right, well,
I better get going.

1515
01:02:05,892 --> 01:02:08,436
(engine revs)

1516
01:02:16,152 --> 01:02:18,613
So that was the last
they heard from Poochie?

1517
01:02:18,655 --> 01:02:20,240
Not exactly.

1518
01:02:20,281 --> 01:02:22,617
[Tanya] Alex! Alex!
(door banging)

1519
01:02:22,659 --> 01:02:23,618
Alex!
(tense dramatic music)

1520
01:02:23,660 --> 01:02:25,453
What is going on?

1521
01:02:25,495 --> 01:02:26,663
- Alex!
- What is going on?

1522
01:02:26,705 --> 01:02:27,580
Let me in, hurry
up! Let me in!

1523
01:02:27,622 --> 01:02:28,873
Hurry!

1524
01:02:28,915 --> 01:02:29,708
Baby, baby,

1525
01:02:29,749 --> 01:02:30,750
what, what?

1526
01:02:30,792 --> 01:02:32,043
Baby? What is going on?

1527
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,253
I think he's following me.

1528
01:02:33,294 --> 01:02:34,254
What? What are
you talking about?

1529
01:02:34,295 --> 01:02:35,505
Who's following you?

1530
01:02:35,547 --> 01:02:36,607
Poochie! He's
trying to kill me.

1531
01:02:36,631 --> 01:02:37,716
What?

1532
01:02:37,757 --> 01:02:38,633
Look, I've been,

1533
01:02:38,675 --> 01:02:39,801
I've been trying to tell him

1534
01:02:39,843 --> 01:02:41,302
ever since I started
over with God.

1535
01:02:41,344 --> 01:02:42,780
And I've been trying to
come clean with this wife,

1536
01:02:42,804 --> 01:02:43,864
but I gotta tell him first.

1537
01:02:43,888 --> 01:02:45,282
Tanya, what are
you talking about?

1538
01:02:45,306 --> 01:02:48,101
Alex, I don't know
who my sons' father is!

1539
01:02:48,143 --> 01:02:48,852
L-Listen,

1540
01:02:48,893 --> 01:02:50,270
first of all, calm down.

1541
01:02:50,311 --> 01:02:51,980
No one's gonna lay
a finger on you

1542
01:02:52,022 --> 01:02:53,231
as long as I'm around.

1543
01:02:53,273 --> 01:02:53,940
I'll die first.

1544
01:02:53,982 --> 01:02:54,941
Come on, come on.

1545
01:02:54,983 --> 01:02:56,067
[Tanya] Hide me, please.

1546
01:02:56,109 --> 01:03:00,155
(Alex shushes)
(door knocking)

1547
01:03:00,196 --> 01:03:01,196
Who is it?

1548
01:03:02,157 --> 01:03:03,676
[Pooch] You know who
it is, man, stop playing.

1549
01:03:03,700 --> 01:03:05,702
(Alex clears throat)

1550
01:03:05,744 --> 01:03:07,037
Can I help you?

1551
01:03:07,078 --> 01:03:08,621
Not unless you
work at Popeye's

1552
01:03:08,663 --> 01:03:10,457
and got two breasts
and a thigh from me.

1553
01:03:10,498 --> 01:03:11,666
(Pooch laughs)

1554
01:03:11,708 --> 01:03:13,185
Come on, man, I'm
looking for my lady.

1555
01:03:13,209 --> 01:03:14,377
Your lady?
(low tense music)

1556
01:03:14,419 --> 01:03:15,419
Yeah, my lady.

1557
01:03:16,421 --> 01:03:17,648
I'm sure she told
you we had history.

1558
01:03:17,672 --> 01:03:19,215
You know what it is, come on.

1559
01:03:20,759 --> 01:03:22,802
Hey, man, you can
check this whole house.

1560
01:03:22,844 --> 01:03:24,429
You're not gonna
find her nowhere.

1561
01:03:25,513 --> 01:03:26,514
I know she in here

1562
01:03:26,556 --> 01:03:27,974
(sniffs) 'cause I can smell her.

1563
01:03:28,016 --> 01:03:29,768
(lips smacking) Come here, baby.

1564
01:03:29,809 --> 01:03:30,602
Come on, Slim.

1565
01:03:30,643 --> 01:03:31,770
Where you at, girl?

1566
01:03:31,811 --> 01:03:34,189
(phone rings)

1567
01:03:35,690 --> 01:03:37,317
Hello?

1568
01:03:37,359 --> 01:03:40,362
Spence, what's up? And
this better be good.

1569
01:03:40,403 --> 01:03:41,403
What?

1570
01:03:42,781 --> 01:03:45,075
All right, I'm on my way.

1571
01:03:45,116 --> 01:03:46,826
All right.
(deep dramatic music)

1572
01:03:46,868 --> 01:03:49,412
[Alex] Man, stay
away from us, Poochie.

1573
01:03:49,454 --> 01:03:50,288
Oh.

1574
01:03:50,330 --> 01:03:50,997
(elbow thumps)

1575
01:03:51,039 --> 01:03:52,082
Man.
(door thuds)

1576
01:03:52,123 --> 01:03:54,000
You heard what I said!

1577
01:03:54,042 --> 01:03:55,210
You heard me, right?

1578
01:03:56,878 --> 01:03:59,047
Yeah, you gonna see me again.

1579
01:03:59,089 --> 01:04:01,966
Yeah, but I'm not so
sure you want to see me.

1580
01:04:02,008 --> 01:04:03,510
Get, get outta my house.

1581
01:04:05,804 --> 01:04:06,864
Well, looks like it's time

1582
01:04:06,888 --> 01:04:08,473
for me to pay Mr.
Poochie a visit.

1583
01:04:08,515 --> 01:04:10,576
W-wait, but don't you want
me to finish telling you

1584
01:04:10,600 --> 01:04:11,851
about the married guy?

1585
01:04:11,893 --> 01:04:13,728
Wait, I thought
that was Poochie.

1586
01:04:13,770 --> 01:04:16,690
Oh no, they're two
totally different guys.

1587
01:04:16,731 --> 01:04:19,693
Remember, I told you she was
fascinated with married men.

1588
01:04:19,734 --> 01:04:23,446
She was running game on both
of these guys at the same time.

1589
01:04:23,488 --> 01:04:24,531
Really?

1590
01:04:24,572 --> 01:04:25,572
Oh yeah.

1591
01:04:26,700 --> 01:04:28,535
As a matter of fact,

1592
01:04:28,576 --> 01:04:31,830
I know I told you I couldn't
describe what he looks like,

1593
01:04:31,871 --> 01:04:33,665
but I do know what
he sounds like.

1594
01:04:35,417 --> 01:04:36,876
Okay.

1595
01:04:36,918 --> 01:04:37,979
It's actually funny, though,

1596
01:04:38,003 --> 01:04:40,171
because that's how
everything adds up

1597
01:04:40,213 --> 01:04:42,382
to the night she was murdered.

1598
01:04:42,424 --> 01:04:43,591
I heard his voice too.

1599
01:04:46,678 --> 01:04:47,887
Yeah?

1600
01:04:47,929 --> 01:04:48,722
Mm-hmm.

1601
01:04:48,763 --> 01:04:49,889
Yep.

1602
01:04:49,931 --> 01:04:52,392
I was talking to Tanya
when he walked in,

1603
01:04:52,434 --> 01:04:56,438
and then she dropped the phone
in shock when she saw him.

1604
01:04:56,479 --> 01:04:57,897
The thing is,

1605
01:04:57,939 --> 01:04:59,149
the phone never hung up.

1606
01:05:00,191 --> 01:05:01,609
Yeah.
(tense ominous music)

1607
01:05:01,651 --> 01:05:02,986
(Tanya laughs)

1608
01:05:03,028 --> 01:05:06,823
(phone thuds)
(sharp menacing music)

1609
01:05:06,865 --> 01:05:08,241
What are you doing here?

1610
01:05:08,283 --> 01:05:10,326
You know exactly
what I'm doing here.

1611
01:05:13,496 --> 01:05:17,584
You think I'm just gonna
let you, quote, unquote,

1612
01:05:17,625 --> 01:05:19,294
"lay it all out on the table"?

1613
01:05:20,628 --> 01:05:21,921
Tell my wife about me and you

1614
01:05:21,963 --> 01:05:23,882
and let you get away with it?

1615
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:24,799
No, no, no,

1616
01:05:24,841 --> 01:05:27,135
you know I'm smarter than that.

1617
01:05:27,177 --> 01:05:28,177
Shut up!

1618
01:05:29,804 --> 01:05:31,348
Save it for the birds.

1619
01:05:34,142 --> 01:05:36,019
Yo.
(alarm chimes)

1620
01:05:36,061 --> 01:05:37,270
What's going on?

1621
01:05:37,312 --> 01:05:39,731
(chuckles) My man,
you're right on time.

1622
01:05:39,773 --> 01:05:40,607
Hm.

1623
01:05:40,648 --> 01:05:41,775
Hey, baby,

1624
01:05:41,816 --> 01:05:44,486
tell Marvin Gaye what's
going on. (laughs)

1625
01:05:44,527 --> 01:05:45,612
Baby?

1626
01:05:45,653 --> 01:05:47,405
Oh, what, you didn't know?

1627
01:05:47,447 --> 01:05:50,700
Baby girl's been
playing both of us, dog.

1628
01:05:50,742 --> 01:05:52,243
No, no, I was playing you.

1629
01:05:52,285 --> 01:05:53,912
I do not live that life anymore.

1630
01:05:53,953 --> 01:05:55,789
Oh, oh, I'm sorry.

1631
01:05:55,830 --> 01:05:56,664
I'm sorry, I forgot.

1632
01:05:56,706 --> 01:05:57,791
She all saved now.

1633
01:05:57,832 --> 01:06:00,502
See, she started
dating the choir boy,

1634
01:06:00,543 --> 01:06:02,545
and she all sanctified.

1635
01:06:03,797 --> 01:06:06,299
Yeah, but she been
playing us, dog.

1636
01:06:07,509 --> 01:06:08,510
Oh, and by the way,

1637
01:06:09,803 --> 01:06:11,012
I'm them boys' papi.

1638
01:06:11,971 --> 01:06:13,473
What is this
dude talking about?

1639
01:06:13,515 --> 01:06:15,725
Dude? Oh, hold on, one
second, my name ain't dude.

1640
01:06:15,767 --> 01:06:17,268
I'm Officer Rashaad.

1641
01:06:17,310 --> 01:06:19,229
And that might
make a difference,

1642
01:06:19,270 --> 01:06:20,814
but it's not in the
next couple minutes

1643
01:06:20,855 --> 01:06:22,190
'cause you're gonna be dead.

1644
01:06:22,232 --> 01:06:23,650
But, long story short,

1645
01:06:24,359 --> 01:06:26,611
I've been giving her the loving,

1646
01:06:26,653 --> 01:06:28,488
and she's been getting
the money from you.

1647
01:06:28,530 --> 01:06:30,865
I mean, I liked
that deal, honestly,

1648
01:06:30,907 --> 01:06:33,827
but all good things
must come to an end.

1649
01:06:33,868 --> 01:06:34,911
Yeah, like you.

1650
01:06:34,953 --> 01:06:36,013
Hey, hey, hey,
hey, hey now, wait.

1651
01:06:36,037 --> 01:06:37,539
Hold up.

1652
01:06:37,580 --> 01:06:38,580
Hold up.

1653
01:06:39,207 --> 01:06:40,667
Don't do anything stupid.

1654
01:06:41,835 --> 01:06:42,752
So lemme get this straight.

1655
01:06:42,794 --> 01:06:44,838
You invited me over here

1656
01:06:44,879 --> 01:06:46,339
so that you can tell me

1657
01:06:46,381 --> 01:06:47,692
that the kids that
I've been paying

1658
01:06:47,716 --> 01:06:51,511
for you to keep quiet from
my wife aren't even mine?

1659
01:06:51,553 --> 01:06:53,388
And you thought I'd
be okay with that?

1660
01:06:55,015 --> 01:06:57,017
I tried to tell you, Poochie.

1661
01:06:57,058 --> 01:07:00,979
You owe me $300,532.23.

1662
01:07:01,021 --> 01:07:03,189
Wow, that's a lot of money.

1663
01:07:04,274 --> 01:07:05,626
Now, I thought you said
you didn't love this dude.

1664
01:07:05,650 --> 01:07:06,401
Wait, what?

1665
01:07:06,443 --> 01:07:08,028
Mm-hmm.

1666
01:07:08,069 --> 01:07:09,696
I never said that.

1667
01:07:09,738 --> 01:07:11,197
Don't listen to him, Rashaad.

1668
01:07:11,239 --> 01:07:12,949
Those words never
came out of my mouth.

1669
01:07:12,991 --> 01:07:14,534
Yeah, you remember,

1670
01:07:14,576 --> 01:07:16,369
that night at the club.

1671
01:07:16,411 --> 01:07:17,120
Wait a minute.

1672
01:07:17,162 --> 01:07:18,038
Wait, wait, wait a minute.

1673
01:07:18,079 --> 01:07:19,581
- Yeah.
- What?

1674
01:07:19,622 --> 01:07:20,999
No.

1675
01:07:21,041 --> 01:07:22,208
(Rashaad stammers)

1676
01:07:22,250 --> 01:07:26,004
I said I didn't love you...

1677
01:07:26,046 --> 01:07:27,922
I didn't love you like that,

1678
01:07:27,964 --> 01:07:29,632
I-I wasn't in love with you,

1679
01:07:29,674 --> 01:07:31,051
not that I didn't love you.

1680
01:07:31,092 --> 01:07:32,093
Oh.

1681
01:07:32,135 --> 01:07:33,720
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

1682
01:07:33,762 --> 01:07:35,221
You've been lying to him

1683
01:07:35,263 --> 01:07:37,307
about me then lying to me

1684
01:07:37,349 --> 01:07:39,184
about how you feel about me.

1685
01:07:39,225 --> 01:07:40,935
(intense ominous music)

1686
01:07:40,977 --> 01:07:42,187
It's not like that.

1687
01:07:42,228 --> 01:07:44,773
It's just, it's just a
big misunderstanding.

1688
01:07:44,814 --> 01:07:46,941
No, no no, it ain't.

1689
01:07:46,983 --> 01:07:49,694
I think I understand
everything perfectly.

1690
01:07:51,071 --> 01:07:54,574
(alarm chimes)

1691
01:07:54,616 --> 01:07:57,744
(door slams)

1692
01:07:57,786 --> 01:07:59,245
Now we're alone.

1693
01:08:02,165 --> 01:08:03,392
Come here, I wanna
tell you something.

1694
01:08:03,416 --> 01:08:04,292
[Tanya] No...
(stammering fearfully)

1695
01:08:04,334 --> 01:08:05,561
No, I just wanna talk to you.

1696
01:08:05,585 --> 01:08:07,962
- Rashaad, I'm sorry.
- No, no, no. (shushes)

1697
01:08:08,004 --> 01:08:09,673
(sharp menacing music)

1698
01:08:09,714 --> 01:08:10,507
Come here!

1699
01:08:10,548 --> 01:08:11,466
[Tanya] Rashaad!

1700
01:08:11,508 --> 01:08:12,717
Rashaad!

1701
01:08:12,759 --> 01:08:16,721
Rashaad, please please please!
(Rashaad yelling)

1702
01:08:16,763 --> 01:08:19,724
(Rashaad laughs)

1703
01:08:19,766 --> 01:08:23,478
Well, it seems like you
solved this whole thing

1704
01:08:24,979 --> 01:08:27,273
just by hearing my
voice on the phone.

1705
01:08:28,274 --> 01:08:30,110
That, and you introduced
yourself to Poochie

1706
01:08:30,151 --> 01:08:31,319
when he walked in.

1707
01:08:31,361 --> 01:08:31,945
Mm.

1708
01:08:31,986 --> 01:08:32,986
Dead giveaway.

1709
01:08:34,364 --> 01:08:38,076
I know you tried hard to put
this on the Jackson Strangler,

1710
01:08:38,118 --> 01:08:40,662
but what's done in the
dark always comes to light.

1711
01:08:40,704 --> 01:08:42,497
(chuckles) Yeah,

1712
01:08:43,665 --> 01:08:45,166
always does.

1713
01:08:46,334 --> 01:08:49,087
Guess I'm gonna just
have to kill you.

1714
01:08:49,129 --> 01:08:50,189
[Officer] I wouldn't
do that if I were you.

1715
01:08:50,213 --> 01:08:53,174
(low tense music)

1716
01:09:06,354 --> 01:09:07,522
Breaking news.

1717
01:09:07,564 --> 01:09:08,874
We've just been
told by authorities

1718
01:09:08,898 --> 01:09:11,901
that they have taken into
custody one of their own,

1719
01:09:11,943 --> 01:09:14,154
a 22-year police veteran.

1720
01:09:14,195 --> 01:09:15,530
Rashaad Williams was arrested

1721
01:09:15,572 --> 01:09:17,323
for the death of Tanya Griffin,

1722
01:09:17,365 --> 01:09:19,117
who was found dead
in her apartment

1723
01:09:19,159 --> 01:09:21,911
that she shared with her
mother and two children.

1724
01:09:21,953 --> 01:09:23,079
(Angie sighs)

1725
01:09:23,121 --> 01:09:25,623
We need to talk, face-to-face.

1726
01:09:26,624 --> 01:09:29,336
So how long have you
known about this?

1727
01:09:29,377 --> 01:09:31,629
Girl, let's
start with forever.

1728
01:09:32,881 --> 01:09:35,717
Wait a minute, why didn't
you just go to the police?

1729
01:09:35,759 --> 01:09:37,302
It's really complicated.

1730
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:38,803
I wanted to look
out for my girl

1731
01:09:38,845 --> 01:09:40,138
because I knew they were dating.

1732
01:09:40,180 --> 01:09:41,973
We know how much
you loved your cousin,

1733
01:09:42,015 --> 01:09:43,433
and we wanted to tell you first.

1734
01:09:43,475 --> 01:09:45,852
And I wanted to prove to her
that there were other women

1735
01:09:45,894 --> 01:09:46,895
besides you and her.

1736
01:09:48,355 --> 01:09:52,275
It just so happens she didn't
get the chance to see them.

1737
01:09:52,317 --> 01:09:53,943
Guess they were meant for you.

1738
01:10:03,495 --> 01:10:05,038
Williams is also
linked to the murder

1739
01:10:05,080 --> 01:10:09,876
of one of Tanya's best friends,
46-year-old Jessica Turner.

1740
01:10:09,918 --> 01:10:11,336
More news at 10:00.

1741
01:10:12,045 --> 01:10:13,505
Hey, listen,

1742
01:10:13,546 --> 01:10:15,882
I hate that you had to
find out about your husband

1743
01:10:15,924 --> 01:10:17,092
and your cousin this way.

1744
01:10:17,133 --> 01:10:18,551
No, no, look,

1745
01:10:18,593 --> 01:10:20,845
(chuckles) I would've
found out eventually.

1746
01:10:23,098 --> 01:10:24,200
I'm just trying to figure out

1747
01:10:24,224 --> 01:10:26,518
how we're going to
prove all of this.

1748
01:10:28,144 --> 01:10:29,479
Oh, trust me,

1749
01:10:29,521 --> 01:10:30,855
I have the perfect setup.

1750
01:10:42,117 --> 01:10:43,243
I see y'all got him.

1751
01:10:43,284 --> 01:10:45,578
Whoo! I'm so glad.

1752
01:10:45,620 --> 01:10:48,915
'Cause I don't carry
this around for nothing.

1753
01:10:48,957 --> 01:10:51,918
