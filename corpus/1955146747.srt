00:11:33,093 --> 00:11:37,162
I KNOW, I KNOW.
IT'S JUST-- IT'S JUST WEIRD.

211
00:11:37,164 --> 00:11:38,963
YOU LIVE WITH THESE PEOPLE
SINCE YOU'RE A KID,

212
00:11:38,965 --> 00:11:41,099
AND THEN,
A DOCTOR COMES ALONG,

213
00:11:41,101 --> 00:11:42,400
AND TELLS YOU
THAT THEY'RE NOT REAL.

214
00:11:42,402 --> 00:11:43,702
THAT IT DOESN'T EXIST,

215

AND IT'S GONNA MAKE
YOU ALL BETTER.

217
00:11:46,306 --> 00:11:50,041
AND... AND THEN
EVERYONE'S GONE.
