1
00:00:03,069 --> 00:00:03,932
Okay, go.

2
00:00:03,960 --> 00:00:04,545
Okay.

3
00:00:05,412 --> 00:00:06,307
- Movie.
- Mm-hmm.

4
00:00:06,545 --> 00:00:07,330
- Three words.
- Mm-hmm.

5
00:00:07,332 --> 00:00:09,422
<i>- Whole idea.
- It's Dances With Wolves.</i>

6
00:00:09,425 --> 00:00:10,305
Ellie will never get it.

7
00:00:10,306 --> 00:00:11,416
That movie came out before I did.

8
00:00:13,959 --> 00:00:14,992
You're dancing.

9
00:00:15,027 --> 00:00:16,127
<i>Step Up. Step Up Revolution.</i>

10
00:00:16,161 --> 00:00:17,295
<i>Step Up 3D.</i>

11
00:00:19,097 --> 00:00:20,991
Second clue.

12
00:00:21,067 --> 00:00:22,134
You're howling.

13
00:00:22,168 --> 00:00:23,435
<i>Twilight. Twilight: New Moon.</i>

14
00:00:23,469 --> 00:00:24,769
<i>Twilight: Eclipse. Twilight: Breaking Dawn.</i>

15
00:00:24,804 --> 00:00:26,203
<i>Twilight: Breaking Dawn part 2.</i>

16
00:00:26,238 --> 00:00:28,272
Honey, I'm dancing. I'm a wolf.

17
00:00:28,307 --> 00:00:30,207
<i>It's Dances with Wolves.</i>

18
00:00:30,242 --> 00:00:32,776
I still don't know what you're saying.

19
00:00:32,811 --> 00:00:33,777
[Imitates buzzer] You talked.

20
00:00:33,812 --> 00:00:34,778
- Our turn.
- Yeah.

21
00:00:34,813 --> 00:00:37,614
It is time to kick some ass.

22
00:00:37,649 --> 00:00:39,183
Of all the things to get macho about,

23
00:00:39,217 --> 00:00:40,617
you pick charades?

24
00:00:40,652 --> 00:00:42,385
He's the Dirty Harry of game night.

25
00:00:42,420 --> 00:00:43,719
- Who's that?
- Oh, God.

26
00:00:43,754 --> 00:00:46,556
We'll never win anything.

27
00:00:46,590 --> 00:00:47,991
Okay, go.

28
00:00:48,025 --> 00:00:49,010
Okay, um...

29
00:00:49,020 --> 00:00:50,186
Movie.

30
00:00:50,221 --> 00:00:51,354
One word.

31
00:00:51,389 --> 00:00:52,623
Whole idea.

32
00:00:52,657 --> 00:00:53,624
You.

33
00:00:53,658 --> 00:00:54,625
It's raining.

34
00:00:54,659 --> 00:00:56,026
You eat a hot dog.

35
00:00:56,060 --> 00:00:58,027
It's undercooked.

36
00:00:58,061 --> 00:00:59,562
You walk downstairs.

37
00:00:59,596 --> 00:01:00,563
<i>- Argo!
- Argo!</i>

38
00:01:00,597 --> 00:01:02,865
- [Yells]
- Yes!

39
00:01:02,900 --> 00:01:05,300
<i>How did you get Argo from that?</i>

40
00:01:05,335 --> 00:01:06,590
We were in New York
together. It was raining.

41
00:01:06,593 --> 00:01:07,993
- I got hungry.
- I bought him a hot dog.

42
00:01:08,027 --> 00:01:09,160
It made me nauseous.

43
00:01:09,195 --> 00:01:10,863
So we took the subway back to the hotel...

44
00:01:10,897 --> 00:01:13,365
<i>Both: And watched
Argo on pay-per-view.</i>

45
00:01:13,399 --> 00:01:14,599
See, grandma?

46
00:01:14,633 --> 00:01:17,134
Those are clues.

47
00:01:17,168 --> 00:01:19,203
Uh-oh, got to go. Sorry, guys.

48
00:01:19,237 --> 00:01:21,472
What, now? It's ice cream sundae time.

49
00:01:21,507 --> 00:01:23,240
Sorry, I'm just a little tired.

50
00:01:24,315 --> 00:01:25,648
Oh, come on, you're putting on lipstick.

51
00:01:25,682 --> 00:01:27,484
You're not tired.

52
00:01:27,518 --> 00:01:30,085
Do you have another date with Carl?

53
00:01:30,120 --> 00:01:31,653
Okay, fine, yes.

54
00:01:31,687 --> 00:01:33,088
We're going to Sam Oliver's.

55
00:01:33,123 --> 00:01:34,456
I love that place.

56
00:01:34,491 --> 00:01:37,226
The lighting makes me look taller.

57
00:01:37,260 --> 00:01:39,495
Why can't I meet this mysterious Carl?

58
00:01:39,529 --> 00:01:40,996
Oh, it's only been a few weeks,

59
00:01:41,031 --> 00:01:42,697
and who knows if anything's gonna happen?

60
00:01:42,732 --> 00:01:43,698
Oh, I do.

61
00:01:43,733 --> 00:01:45,733
Something's gonna happen.

62
00:01:46,902 --> 00:01:48,636
Okay, go. Have fun.

63
00:01:48,670 --> 00:01:49,803
- Good night, guys.
- Bye-bye, honey.

64
00:01:49,838 --> 00:01:50,804
Have a good time.

65
00:01:50,839 --> 00:01:51,265
[Laughs]

66
00:01:51,490 --> 00:01:53,457
She's hiding something.

67
00:01:53,492 --> 00:01:56,227
She usually drags me to
meet the guys she's dating.

68
00:01:56,261 --> 00:01:58,797
So what's going on with Carl?

69
00:01:58,831 --> 00:02:00,131
Ready. Go.

70
00:02:00,166 --> 00:02:01,965
He's married. He's a criminal.

71
00:02:02,000 --> 00:02:03,567
He doesn't have a face.

72
00:02:05,103 --> 00:02:06,403
He doesn't have a face?

73
00:02:06,437 --> 00:02:08,005
That's your guess?

74
00:02:08,039 --> 00:02:09,710
I hate game night.

75
00:02:09,715 --> 00:02:11,181
All right, I'm going to Sam Oliver's

76
00:02:11,216 --> 00:02:12,282
to find out what's happening.

77
00:02:12,317 --> 00:02:13,617
And by the way, that lighting thing

78
00:02:13,652 --> 00:02:14,852
is all in her head.

79
00:02:14,886 --> 00:02:16,419
She's short no matter where you take her.

Hey, Liz.

82
00:02:27,030 --> 00:02:28,631
Sean, what are you doing here?

83
00:02:28,666 --> 00:02:30,433
Just meeting some friends.

84
00:02:30,468 --> 00:02:31,434
You know, Tim and Chris.

85
00:02:31,469 --> 00:02:32,808
Those are people.

86
00:02:32,812 --> 00:02:34,280
Not real people.

87
00:02:34,314 --> 00:02:35,481
You're spying on me.

88
00:02:35,515 --> 00:02:37,249
I am... yes.

89
00:02:37,284 --> 00:02:39,718
But why have you been
so secretive about Carl?

90
00:02:39,753 --> 00:02:41,287
Is he a criminal? Does he have a wife?

91
00:02:41,321 --> 00:02:44,156
How's his face? Does he have one?

92
00:02:44,190 --> 00:02:47,293
Rainbow cocktails flying in.

93
00:02:47,327 --> 00:02:50,595
Oh, that dodo bartender had
no idea how to make these,

94
00:02:50,629 --> 00:02:51,663
so I staged a mutiny.

95
00:02:51,697 --> 00:02:53,063
Made 'em myself.

96
00:02:53,098 --> 00:02:55,300
- Hello.
- Hello.

97
00:02:55,334 --> 00:02:56,434
Sean, this is Carl.

98
00:02:56,468 --> 00:02:57,426
Carl, Sean.

99
00:02:57,427 --> 00:03:00,329
Look at Sean all naked without a drink.

100
00:03:00,363 --> 00:03:01,463
Here, you take this one.

101
00:03:01,498 --> 00:03:02,764
I'll go make another.

102
00:03:02,798 --> 00:03:05,166
Maybe this time, that tattooed man God

103
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:06,800
behind the bar will pay attention.

104
00:03:12,818 --> 00:03:15,820
So no wife there.

105
00:03:15,854 --> 00:03:17,922
I know. Isn't it great? What a catch.

106
00:03:17,957 --> 00:03:19,157
Just so we're clear,

107
00:03:19,191 --> 00:03:21,224
Carl is super gay.

108
00:03:21,259 --> 00:03:22,326
He came to earth

109
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:25,562
when his gay planet burst into flames.

110
00:03:25,596 --> 00:03:28,131
What? Carl is gay?

111
00:03:28,166 --> 00:03:30,700
Ugh, thanks for nothing, match.com.

112
00:03:32,203 --> 00:03:33,770
Oh, my God. You know he's gay.

113
00:03:33,804 --> 00:03:35,172
That's why you didn't want me to meet him.

114
00:03:35,206 --> 00:03:36,439
- I can explain.
- [Gasps]

115
00:03:36,473 --> 00:03:38,841
You're cheating on me
with another gay man...

116
00:03:41,478 --> 00:03:43,812
Who makes delicious cocktails.

117
00:03:44,914 --> 00:03:46,782
Damn it, that's good.

118
00:03:52,059 --> 00:03:53,892
I can't believe you're sneaking around

119
00:03:53,927 --> 00:03:55,994
seeing another gay man.

120
00:03:56,029 --> 00:03:59,031
I'm so stupid. I never even suspected.

121
00:03:59,065 --> 00:04:00,799
I'm sorry. I wasn't looking for it.

122
00:04:00,834 --> 00:04:03,134
It just happened.

123
00:04:03,168 --> 00:04:06,137
Oh, please, these things don't just happen.

124
00:04:06,171 --> 00:04:09,473
Come on, Sean, you know
it's always been you.

125
00:04:09,507 --> 00:04:11,408
Do I?

126
00:04:11,443 --> 00:04:14,778
All I'm hearing right now are just words.

127
00:04:14,813 --> 00:04:17,181
Can't a girl have more
than one gay best friend?

128
00:04:17,216 --> 00:04:17,775
No.

129
00:04:17,799 --> 00:04:20,801
Have you no respect for traditional values?

130
00:04:23,171 --> 00:04:24,505
I'm sorry.

131
00:04:24,539 --> 00:04:26,340
It's just, you and I used
to go out all the time,

132
00:04:26,374 --> 00:04:28,642
and now all we do is sit
at home with your family.

133
00:04:28,677 --> 00:04:30,778
I am 26 years old.

134
00:04:32,580 --> 00:04:36,015
I tell people I'm 26 years old.

135
00:04:36,049 --> 00:04:38,150
I need to get out more.

136
00:04:38,185 --> 00:04:39,251
You deceived me.

137
00:04:39,286 --> 00:04:41,654
I would never do that to you.

138
00:04:41,689 --> 00:04:43,623
You know what you are?

139
00:04:43,657 --> 00:04:44,990
Movie.

140
00:04:45,025 --> 00:04:46,158
Two words.

141
00:04:46,193 --> 00:04:47,193
<i>Liar Liar.</i>

142
00:04:52,034 --> 00:04:54,903
So this Christmas, we have
some fun, exciting products

143

that'll ensure your website

144
00:04:58,040 --> 00:04:59,208
And for your Jewish customers,

145
00:04:59,242 --> 00:05:02,411
we have some things
that are right-on-ukkah.

146
00:05:02,445 --> 00:05:04,680
Oh, Tippy, you are my favorite vendor.

147
00:05:04,714 --> 00:05:06,880
You are vend-orable.

148
00:05:06,915 --> 00:05:09,550
And you are my smartest
and handsomest buyer.

149
00:05:09,585 --> 00:05:10,784
I always look forward to coming here

150
00:05:10,819 --> 00:05:11,995
and gettin' my Sean on.

151
00:05:12,947 --> 00:05:14,080
- [Chuckles]
- Now, come on.

152
00:05:14,115 --> 00:05:15,314
Do that thing you do.

153
00:05:15,349 --> 00:05:16,315
Oh, no.

154
00:05:16,350 --> 00:05:17,517
- Come on.
- You want me to?

155
00:05:17,551 --> 00:05:18,652
- I want you to do it.
- I'm gonna do it.

156
00:05:18,686 --> 00:05:19,786
- Do it.
- Watch this.

157
00:05:19,820 --> 00:05:22,788
Okay, I like this one but in this fabric

158
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:24,222
but with this mistletoe pattern.

159
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,390
All: Ooh!

160
00:05:25,424 --> 00:05:27,159
I like this belt but in a brass buckle.

161
00:05:27,193 --> 00:05:28,694
All: Ah!

162
00:05:28,728 --> 00:05:31,263
And this, I never want to see again.

163
00:05:31,297 --> 00:05:33,498
[Applause]

164
00:05:33,533 --> 00:05:34,733
Hang on, everybody.

165
00:05:34,738 --> 00:05:36,505
Ever since I bought this company,

166
00:05:36,539 --> 00:05:38,873
I've watched Sean predict the latest trends

167
00:05:38,908 --> 00:05:40,374
while you've all marveled,

168
00:05:40,409 --> 00:05:42,710
your tiny mouths slack-jawed in wonder

169
00:05:42,745 --> 00:05:45,079
like yokels in a burlesque tent.

170
00:05:46,548 --> 00:05:49,416
We're all flattered by
that assessment, sir.

171
00:05:49,450 --> 00:05:50,717
But Sean's not the only one

172
00:05:50,752 --> 00:05:52,318
who can spot the latest
trends and pounce on them.

173
00:05:52,353 --> 00:05:53,353
Jerry, now.

174
00:05:56,090 --> 00:05:58,759
Right now, nothing's as
white-hot as medieval fantasy:

175
00:05:58,793 --> 00:06:00,393
<i>The Hobbit, Game of Yhrones,</i>

176
00:06:00,428 --> 00:06:02,529
restaurants where jousting is encouraged.

177
00:06:03,634 --> 00:06:04,634
I love fantasy.

178
00:06:04,668 --> 00:06:06,035
Of course you do,

179
00:06:06,069 --> 00:06:08,304
because your real life is a
bleak wasteland of monotony.

180
00:06:08,339 --> 00:06:10,473
It's better since I got cable.

181
00:06:11,808 --> 00:06:13,209
Anyway, all of the men in that genre

182
00:06:13,244 --> 00:06:14,910
wear our next big product...

183
00:06:14,945 --> 00:06:16,712
[Snaps fingers]

184
00:06:16,747 --> 00:06:18,347
Chain mail pants.

185
00:06:20,183 --> 00:06:22,351
I bought 300 pairs of these
off a film production company

186
00:06:22,385 --> 00:06:24,953
that lost its financing when
Shaquille O'Neal dropped out.

187
00:06:25,675 --> 00:06:26,641
This is really heavy.

188
00:06:26,676 --> 00:06:27,977
Can I please put it down?

189
00:06:28,011 --> 00:06:31,780
It's "may I," and no.

190
00:06:31,814 --> 00:06:33,782
Max, I don't know that
we're gonna sell these.

191
00:06:33,816 --> 00:06:36,017
Our customers are pretty discerning,

192
00:06:36,051 --> 00:06:39,120
and they like their pants under 50 pounds.

193
00:06:39,154 --> 00:06:43,024
Oh, look, Sean is so
intimidated by my savvy.

194
00:06:43,058 --> 00:06:44,325
What say you, Hunter?

195
00:06:44,360 --> 00:06:45,860
Are these pants hip? Yea or nay.

196
00:06:45,895 --> 00:06:47,639
I'm gonna go with nay, Max.

197
00:06:47,643 --> 00:06:48,617
Unwise.

198
00:06:48,798 --> 00:06:51,064
In the name of Shaquille
O'Neal, we will sell these pants.

199
00:06:52,901 --> 00:06:54,735
You can put those down now, Jerry.

200
00:06:54,770 --> 00:06:57,137
We don't know that.

201
00:07:03,011 --> 00:07:04,211
Oh, sorry.

202
00:07:04,245 --> 00:07:05,445
I overslept.

203
00:07:05,479 --> 00:07:08,181
Oh, fun night with your bitch, Carl?

204
00:07:09,784 --> 00:07:12,385
Just tell me how the sales meeting went.

205
00:07:12,420 --> 00:07:13,386
It was fantastic.

206
00:07:13,421 --> 00:07:14,454
Oprah came. You missed it.

207
00:07:14,488 --> 00:07:16,289
She gave everybody a car.

208
00:07:16,324 --> 00:07:19,826
Sean, I am not going to
apologize for seeing Carl.

209
00:07:19,860 --> 00:07:21,860
I'm allowed to have friends
who want to do something

210
00:07:21,894 --> 00:07:23,429
other than sit at home with their family

211
00:07:23,463 --> 00:07:24,797
and play charades.

212
00:07:24,831 --> 00:07:26,998
Did someone say charades?

213
00:07:27,033 --> 00:07:29,335
Charades is my jam.

214
00:07:29,369 --> 00:07:31,403
Really? Mine too.

215
00:07:31,438 --> 00:07:33,205
I have a very expressive body.

216
00:07:33,239 --> 00:07:36,608
It says things my mouth wouldn't dare.

217
00:07:36,643 --> 00:07:37,709
Oh.

218
00:07:39,341 --> 00:07:40,642
Let's take it for a spin.

219
00:07:40,676 --> 00:07:42,210
Game night, tonight, my house.

220
00:07:42,245 --> 00:07:43,611
We need a fourth player.

221
00:07:43,646 --> 00:07:45,413
The person who used to come
developed a drinking problem

222
00:07:45,447 --> 00:07:47,315
and now can't even get to work on time.

223
00:07:47,349 --> 00:07:49,417
- Oh, poor thing.
- Hmm.

224
00:07:49,451 --> 00:07:50,886
Oh, don't feel sorry for her.

225
00:07:50,920 --> 00:07:52,154
She has a new, sassy friend

226
00:07:52,188 --> 00:07:54,755
who doesn't call 9:30 a late night.

227
00:07:56,091 --> 00:07:57,925
What do you say, Tippy?

228
00:07:57,959 --> 00:07:59,526
Want to replace her?

229
00:07:59,560 --> 00:08:01,028
You'd have to be willing to play charades,

230
00:08:01,062 --> 00:08:04,398
then conveniently leave
before it's time to clean up.

231
00:08:04,432 --> 00:08:05,833
Eff yeah!

232
00:08:05,867 --> 00:08:07,034
Can I bring anything?

233
00:08:07,068 --> 00:08:08,769
Just your loyalty.

234
00:08:11,882 --> 00:08:13,349
Oh, and maybe a seven-layer dip...

235
00:08:13,383 --> 00:08:14,851
or five, whatever you have time for.

236
00:08:20,061 --> 00:08:21,695
And go.

237
00:08:21,729 --> 00:08:22,696
Movie.

238
00:08:22,730 --> 00:08:24,097
Three words.

239
00:08:24,131 --> 00:08:25,931
Whole idea.

240
00:08:25,966 --> 00:08:26,932
Smack!

241
00:08:26,967 --> 00:08:28,166
Ow!

242
00:08:28,201 --> 00:08:29,201
That hurt.

243
00:08:30,737 --> 00:08:32,237
Mascara.

244
00:08:32,271 --> 00:08:33,739
Itchy eyes.

245
00:08:33,773 --> 00:08:34,740
Smack!

246
00:08:34,774 --> 00:08:35,741
Ow!

247
00:08:35,775 --> 00:08:36,742
Stop slapping me.

248
00:08:36,776 --> 00:08:38,077
I'm doing the best I can.

249
00:08:38,111 --> 00:08:40,545
<i>God's sakes. It's Boys Don't Cry.</i>

250
00:08:40,580 --> 00:08:41,946
Yes.

251
00:08:41,981 --> 00:08:43,347
You are good at this, lady.

252
00:08:43,381 --> 00:08:45,182
I want you as my partner next time.

253
00:08:45,217 --> 00:08:47,085
You're fun. She's fun.

254
00:08:47,085 --> 00:08:49,954
Way better than the other one.

255
00:08:49,988 --> 00:08:51,823
You're more fun than anyone.

256
00:08:51,857 --> 00:08:53,892
And look how beautiful you are.

257
00:08:53,926 --> 00:08:55,512
Such a sense of style.

258
00:08:55,515 --> 00:08:57,314
Will you take me shopping sometime?

259
00:08:57,349 --> 00:08:58,616
You're on.

260
00:08:58,650 --> 00:09:00,984
Why'd it take you so long
to get a decent friend?

261
00:09:02,287 --> 00:09:05,189
So we done here?

262
00:09:05,223 --> 00:09:06,823
No, we're just taking a break.

263
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,259
Come on, let's get our sundaes.

264
00:09:08,293 --> 00:09:09,260
Race you to the freezer.

265
00:09:09,294 --> 00:09:10,261
Losers eat second.

266
00:09:10,295 --> 00:09:12,629
Bam!

267
00:09:12,663 --> 00:09:13,729
Ow.

268
00:09:13,764 --> 00:09:14,897
We're just getting ice cream,

269
00:09:14,931 --> 00:09:18,234
not storming a Walmart on Black Friday.

270
00:09:18,269 --> 00:09:20,436
Tippy's got a lot of energy.

271
00:09:20,471 --> 00:09:23,699
Yeah, like that chimp that
tore that guy's nuts off.

272
00:09:23,704 --> 00:09:25,171
Hey, hey, hey.

273
00:09:25,206 --> 00:09:26,772
First of all, there's a
part of me that's delighted

274
00:09:26,807 --> 00:09:29,074
by what you just said.

275
00:09:29,142 --> 00:09:30,709
Second of all, Tippy's our guest.

276
00:09:30,743 --> 00:09:32,944
Let's give her a chance.

277
00:09:32,979 --> 00:09:33,945
Sean, sit down.

278
00:09:33,980 --> 00:09:35,514
I have a surprise for you.

279
00:09:35,548 --> 00:09:36,948
Oh, we don't need to do that.

280
00:09:36,983 --> 00:09:39,251
Sit down and close your eyes.

281
00:09:39,285 --> 00:09:40,252
Come on, dad.

282
00:09:40,286 --> 00:09:41,720
She's our guest.

283
00:09:41,754 --> 00:09:43,755
Let's give her a chance.

284
00:09:43,789 --> 00:09:45,156
Okay.

285
00:09:45,190 --> 00:09:48,092
[Both giggling]

286
00:09:48,127 --> 00:09:50,661
[Sean yelling]

287
00:09:50,695 --> 00:09:52,963
[Tippy laughing]

288
00:09:52,998 --> 00:09:54,532
[Muffled] I don't like this!

289
00:09:54,566 --> 00:09:55,900
He said he wants more.

290
00:09:55,934 --> 00:09:57,435
Oh! [Laughs]

291
00:09:57,469 --> 00:09:58,469
[Yells]

292
00:10:02,542 --> 00:10:04,175
Hey, Sean.

293
00:10:04,209 --> 00:10:05,977
I wrote the copy for
Max's chain mail pants,

294
00:10:06,012 --> 00:10:07,679
which have been on our website for a week.

295
00:10:07,713 --> 00:10:09,313
Guess how many we sold.

296
00:10:09,348 --> 00:10:10,782
If your number is higher than zero,

297
00:10:10,816 --> 00:10:13,384
revise it downward.

298
00:10:13,418 --> 00:10:15,153
Poor you.

299
00:10:15,187 --> 00:10:18,822
How many of these you think we could sell?

300
00:10:18,857 --> 00:10:19,857
Oh, my God.

301
00:10:19,891 --> 00:10:21,091
Did you get that from Tippy?

302
00:10:21,126 --> 00:10:22,460
No, it was a gift from Queen Elizabeth.

303
00:10:22,494 --> 00:10:24,928
It was part of her jubilee.

304
00:10:24,963 --> 00:10:27,230
You've been seeing a
lot of that chick lately.

305
00:10:27,265 --> 00:10:28,231
I know.

306
00:10:28,266 --> 00:10:29,566
First it was game night.

307
00:10:29,600 --> 00:10:30,967
Then it was pizza night.

308
00:10:31,001 --> 00:10:33,036
Then it was "I'm in bed
but my back door's open

309
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:36,343
so she let herself in and I
almost called the cops" night.

310
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:37,647
What started out as a friendship

311
00:10:37,681 --> 00:10:40,150
has turned into a hostage crisis.

312
00:10:40,184 --> 00:10:41,151
We should get Tippy to buy

313
00:10:41,185 --> 00:10:42,452
a pair of those chain mail pants,

314
00:10:42,486 --> 00:10:43,920
then push her in the lake.

315
00:10:45,996 --> 00:10:48,264
Solve both our problems.

316
00:10:48,298 --> 00:10:49,365
That would never work.

317
00:10:49,399 --> 00:10:50,700
She's as strong as a grizzly bear.

318
00:10:50,734 --> 00:10:52,535
Oh, Hunter, I want you to jazz up the copy

319
00:10:52,570 --> 00:10:53,836
on those chain mail pants.

320
00:10:53,871 --> 00:10:55,939
This whole project has
been enormously successful,

321
00:10:55,973 --> 00:10:58,941
but we still have a few pairs left.

322
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,208
Oh, come on, Max.

323
00:11:00,242 --> 00:11:01,509
No one's bought any of them.

324
00:11:01,544 --> 00:11:02,811
And even if we do sell a pair,

325
00:11:02,845 --> 00:11:05,280
they'll cost as much to ship as a llama.

326
00:11:07,416 --> 00:11:08,416
I once shipped a llama...

327
00:11:08,451 --> 00:11:10,151
very expensive.

328
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:10,922
Fascinating.

329
00:11:10,937 --> 00:11:12,037
I want to hear all about

330
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,639
the packaging and mailing of livestock.

331
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:15,506
Please elaborate in a different locale.

332
00:11:18,243 --> 00:11:19,944
I do not appreciate
you shaming me like that

333
00:11:19,978 --> 00:11:20,945
in front of Sean.

334
00:11:20,979 --> 00:11:22,213
If this was a Japanese company,

335
00:11:22,247 --> 00:11:24,649
I'd be within my rights
to chop your head off.

336
00:11:24,683 --> 00:11:26,384
I'm pretty sure you're confusing

337
00:11:26,418 --> 00:11:28,820
the Japanese with Klingons.

338
00:11:28,854 --> 00:11:30,354
Don't play the race card with me.

339
00:11:31,989 --> 00:11:33,857
Look, we have to show Sean that I am right.

340
00:11:33,891 --> 00:11:36,326
So tonight we are going
to viral market the pants

341
00:11:36,361 --> 00:11:38,362
by wearing them to bars all over town.

342
00:11:38,396 --> 00:11:40,096
We'll be tweeted and tumblr'd

343
00:11:40,130 --> 00:11:41,732
until the entire Internet is abuzz

344
00:11:41,766 --> 00:11:44,968
about the two dapper dudes
in the stainless steel slacks.

345
00:11:46,670 --> 00:11:48,337
Yeah, I don't want to do that.

346
00:11:48,372 --> 00:11:49,972
Be in the chain mail pants by 8:00.

347
00:11:50,006 --> 00:11:52,274
And don't wear that shirt.
We don't want to look stupid.

348
00:11:58,188 --> 00:12:01,357
Ugh, they said that place
was supposed to be fusion?

349
00:12:01,391 --> 00:12:03,658
Yeah, fusion between ew and yuck.

350
00:12:03,692 --> 00:12:06,027
[Laughs]

351
00:12:06,061 --> 00:12:07,695
[Laughs]

352
00:12:07,730 --> 00:12:09,931
Tippy, you're so funny.

353
00:12:09,965 --> 00:12:11,600
What? What'd I say?

354
00:12:11,634 --> 00:12:13,168
[Laughs]

355
00:12:13,202 --> 00:12:15,737
"What'd I say?" [Laughs]

356
00:12:15,771 --> 00:12:18,405
[Laughs]

357
00:12:18,440 --> 00:12:21,575
Carl, you maniac, you are so funny.

358
00:12:21,610 --> 00:12:24,245
[Laughs] Ah, oh, Tippy, my side.

359
00:12:24,279 --> 00:12:27,281
Stop it. [Laughs]

360
00:12:27,315 --> 00:12:30,317
[Laughing]

361
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:35,255
Oh, you're the funniest gay man I know.

362
00:12:35,289 --> 00:12:36,523
[Laughs]

363
00:12:36,557 --> 00:12:38,224
You just laugh-spat on me.

364
00:12:38,259 --> 00:12:39,225
I'm out of here.

365
00:12:39,260 --> 00:12:42,093
[Laughter]

366
00:12:42,128 --> 00:12:43,395
Oh, my God.

367
00:12:43,429 --> 00:12:44,105
Tippy is so much fun.

368
00:12:44,424 --> 00:12:46,058
I know, and Carl's the greatest.

369
00:12:46,092 --> 00:12:47,493
Oh, good, then it's all working out.

370
00:12:47,528 --> 00:12:48,761
Yeah, except for one thing.

371
00:12:48,795 --> 00:12:50,596
- What's that?
- I hate him.

372
00:12:50,631 --> 00:12:51,517
Can we talk?

373
00:12:52,703 --> 00:12:53,936
So what's going on, Liz?

374
00:12:53,990 --> 00:12:56,092
I used to think Carl was fun and bitchy,

375
00:12:56,126 --> 00:12:58,427
but it turns out he's just bitchy.

376
00:12:58,461 --> 00:13:01,029
But when you came in, you
were just laughing so hard.

377
00:13:01,063 --> 00:13:02,063
I have to.

378
00:13:02,098 --> 00:13:03,332
If I don't laugh at his jokes,

379
00:13:03,366 --> 00:13:07,703
he makes fun of me and
calls me "Liz Miserableh."

380
00:13:07,737 --> 00:13:10,939
[Laughs]

381
00:13:10,973 --> 00:13:12,906
What a jerk.

382
00:13:12,941 --> 00:13:14,908
Why are you still hanging out with him?

383
00:13:14,943 --> 00:13:16,744
'Cause you were having
so much fun with Tippy,

384
00:13:16,778 --> 00:13:18,279
and I wanted to make you jealous.

385
00:13:18,313 --> 00:13:20,348
God, who does that?

386
00:13:23,752 --> 00:13:24,719
Well, the truth is, I...

387
00:13:24,753 --> 00:13:25,650
I'll tell you who.

388
00:13:25,660 --> 00:13:28,528
A petty, pathetic person

389
00:13:28,562 --> 00:13:32,432
who's insecure and a
terrible, terrible friend.

390
00:13:32,467 --> 00:13:34,501
You were right when you
said that I deceived you,

391
00:13:34,535 --> 00:13:35,935
and you would never do that to me

392
00:13:35,970 --> 00:13:38,771
'cause you're a good person.

393
00:13:38,806 --> 00:13:40,207
I'm sorry. I interrupted you.

394
00:13:40,241 --> 00:13:41,908
What were you going to say?

395
00:13:44,878 --> 00:13:46,245
I forgive you.

396
00:13:47,780 --> 00:13:48,544
Hey.

397
00:13:48,548 --> 00:13:49,749
I was thinking,

398
00:13:49,783 --> 00:13:52,118
why don't we all go out
for drinks after work?

399
00:13:52,152 --> 00:13:54,320
Sean's bestie will hang with...

400
00:13:54,354 --> 00:13:55,554
Sean's other bestie.

401
00:13:55,589 --> 00:13:56,555
[Laughs]

402
00:13:56,590 --> 00:13:59,758
It'll be a bestie festie, aah!

403
00:13:59,792 --> 00:14:01,793
That sounds awful.

404
00:14:03,029 --> 00:14:05,530
I mean awful.

405
00:14:05,564 --> 00:14:06,765
Why can't I say "awesome"?

406
00:14:06,799 --> 00:14:07,766
Oh, there I go.

407
00:14:07,800 --> 00:14:09,101
That sounds awful.

408
00:14:09,135 --> 00:14:10,335
Oh, my God.

409
00:14:13,847 --> 00:14:15,480
- Hey, Liz.
- Oh, hey, Ellie.

410
00:14:15,514 --> 00:14:16,947
I think your dad's in with Max.

411
00:14:16,982 --> 00:14:19,517
Actually, I'm here to see you.

412
00:14:19,551 --> 00:14:21,085
We need you back in our lives.

413
00:14:21,119 --> 00:14:22,353
Why?

414
00:14:22,388 --> 00:14:24,288
Because Tippy keeps
calling me Ellie-Belly,

415
00:14:24,322 --> 00:14:26,156
then poking me in the gut.

416
00:14:27,659 --> 00:14:28,860
Really, you don't like her?

417
00:14:28,894 --> 00:14:30,094
'Cause your dad loves her.

418
00:14:30,128 --> 00:14:32,529
Actually, he can't stand her.

419
00:14:32,563 --> 00:14:34,798
Shut up and tell me more.

420
00:14:36,501 --> 00:14:40,003
I'm not proud of this, but
I am very excited right now.

421
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:41,505
The other day, Tippy let herself in,

422
00:14:41,539 --> 00:14:43,039
and my dad hid in that
closet under the stairs

423
00:14:43,073 --> 00:14:44,307
where all the spiders are.

424
00:14:44,341 --> 00:14:47,310
He screamed for a full
hour without making a sound.

425
00:14:49,479 --> 00:14:50,913
Oh, my God.

426
00:14:50,947 --> 00:14:52,981
I can't believe he's been lying to me,

427
00:14:53,016 --> 00:14:55,117
even after I came clean about Carl.

428
00:14:55,151 --> 00:14:57,185
So what are you gonna do?

429
00:14:57,220 --> 00:14:58,521
Movie. Four words.

430
00:14:58,555 --> 00:15:00,289
Just tell me.

431
00:15:00,323 --> 00:15:02,357
<i>There will be blood.</i>

432
00:15:04,026 --> 00:15:06,060
I think you guys make up these movies.

433
00:15:16,256 --> 00:15:18,256
[Both chuckling]

434
00:15:20,159 --> 00:15:21,226
Well, it's been three minutes.

435
00:15:21,260 --> 00:15:22,427
Looks like Liz isn't gonna show.

436
00:15:22,461 --> 00:15:23,561
I guess we should call it a night.

437
00:15:23,596 --> 00:15:24,763
Wait.

438
00:15:24,797 --> 00:15:26,464
It's okay if Liz doesn't come.

439
00:15:26,498 --> 00:15:27,733
You know what's crazy?

440
00:15:27,767 --> 00:15:29,467
My place is only two blocks from here.

441
00:15:29,501 --> 00:15:32,903
Maybe we should go there and make love.

442
00:15:32,938 --> 00:15:34,371
What?

443
00:15:34,405 --> 00:15:36,440
You know you want to.

444
00:15:36,474 --> 00:15:37,808
No, I don't.

445
00:15:37,843 --> 00:15:39,243
I think you do.

446
00:15:39,277 --> 00:15:41,411
I really don't.

447
00:15:41,446 --> 00:15:43,447
Come on, let's do it.

448
00:15:43,481 --> 00:15:44,448
No, let's not.

449
00:15:44,482 --> 00:15:45,616
I love what we have, Sean.

450
00:15:45,650 --> 00:15:47,817
Let's take it to the next level.

451
00:15:47,852 --> 00:15:50,286
You know I'm gay.

452
00:15:50,320 --> 00:15:52,222
We're all a little something.

453
00:15:52,256 --> 00:15:54,557
I'm not just a little gay.

454
00:15:54,591 --> 00:15:55,591
No.

455
00:15:55,626 --> 00:15:58,561
You're a big, strong gay.

456
00:16:00,998 --> 00:16:02,197
Oh, hey, guys.

457
00:16:02,232 --> 00:16:03,732
Sean, I have great news.

458
00:16:03,767 --> 00:16:07,302
I got us two tickets to see
Justin Timberlake on the 15th.

459
00:16:07,336 --> 00:16:09,138
- You want to go?
- Justin Timberlake?

460
00:16:09,172 --> 00:16:10,605
Yes. Oh, my God.

461
00:16:10,640 --> 00:16:12,107
It's in Madison,

462
00:16:12,142 --> 00:16:14,309
so I thought we could spend
the night at my aunt's cabin.

463
00:16:14,343 --> 00:16:15,944
That sounds fantastic.

464
00:16:15,979 --> 00:16:18,479
I know, right? [Laughs]

465
00:16:18,513 --> 00:16:20,782
Only I'm not free that weekend.

466
00:16:22,851 --> 00:16:25,820
So I thought you could take Tippy instead.

467
00:16:25,854 --> 00:16:27,388
Wait. What's happening?

468
00:16:27,422 --> 00:16:29,824
Tippy, are you a big J.T. fan?

469
00:16:29,858 --> 00:16:30,858
[Gasps]

470
00:16:30,893 --> 00:16:32,160
Oh, my God.

471
00:16:32,194 --> 00:16:36,196
We're going to see J.T. in
Madison and spend the night.

472
00:16:36,230 --> 00:16:37,463
Hang on, the 15th?

473
00:16:37,498 --> 00:16:40,100
- Mm-hmm.
- I thought you said the 50th.

474
00:16:41,202 --> 00:16:43,003
I have a thing on the 15th.

475
00:16:43,037 --> 00:16:44,070
- Oh, no, you don't.
- Yeah, yeah.

476
00:16:44,105 --> 00:16:45,071
- Nope.
- It's on the...

477
00:16:45,106 --> 00:16:46,206
- Mm-mm.
- Yup.

478
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:47,473
- Checked your calendar.
- But I... so did I...

479
00:16:47,508 --> 00:16:48,741
- Yup, it's free.
- Nope.

480
00:16:48,776 --> 00:16:50,910
- Totally clear.
- This is so exciting.

481
00:16:50,944 --> 00:16:52,477
I'm gonna have you all to myself.

482
00:16:52,512 --> 00:16:55,114
I'm just gonna run to
the little girls' room.

483
00:16:55,148 --> 00:16:56,548
Don't drink too much.

484
00:16:56,582 --> 00:16:57,917
I have clean sheets on my bed,

485
00:16:57,951 --> 00:16:59,551
and I don't want them to stay that way.

486
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:00,585
[Gasps]

487
00:17:04,257 --> 00:17:05,457
Did you see that?

488
00:17:05,491 --> 00:17:06,457
[Scoffs]

489
00:17:06,491 --> 00:17:08,426
Tippy made a pass at me.

490
00:17:08,460 --> 00:17:09,760
Well, as much as I like her,

491
00:17:09,795 --> 00:17:10,995
I'm gonna have to break things off.

492
00:17:11,030 --> 00:17:12,831
- Oh, well, let's go.
- Hey.

493
00:17:12,865 --> 00:17:13,998
You are so full of crap.

494
00:17:14,033 --> 00:17:15,499
I know you don't like Tippy.

495
00:17:15,534 --> 00:17:17,969
What?

496
00:17:18,003 --> 00:17:21,239
Ellie told me because she's not a liar.

497
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:24,074
Ellie... damn it, there's
always a loose end.

498
00:17:24,108 --> 00:17:27,110
[Pants jingling]

499
00:17:30,215 --> 00:17:32,249
Max, we have been to four bars already.

500
00:17:32,283 --> 00:17:33,317
I want to go home.

501
00:17:33,351 --> 00:17:35,418
I feel like I'm wearing a
cheese grater for a jockstrap.

502
00:17:35,453 --> 00:17:36,419
Suck it up, man.

503
00:17:36,454 --> 00:17:37,454
That's our target audience.

504
00:17:37,488 --> 00:17:38,620
Let's go.

505
00:17:38,655 --> 00:17:41,423
Wow, the betties sure
are going crazy tonight,

506
00:17:41,458 --> 00:17:42,992

Yeah, dungeons and douche bags.

[Both snicker]

511
00:17:51,301 --> 00:17:52,335
Are we finished?

512
00:17:52,369 --> 00:17:54,202
'Cause that was the least mean feedback

513
00:17:54,237 --> 00:17:55,237
we've had all night.

514
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:56,604
Yes, I need a drink.

515
00:17:56,638 --> 00:17:58,306
I snagged a pube, and
if I don't dull the pain,

516
00:17:58,341 --> 00:17:59,841
I'm gonna start crying.

517

[Both groan]

518
00:18:04,765 --> 00:18:06,032
Sean was right.

519
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:07,367
I suck at trendsetting.

520
00:18:07,401 --> 00:18:08,734
Oh, don't beat yourself up.

00:18:08,769 --> 00:18:11,337
Look, you shouldn't try to out-Sean Sean.

522
00:18:11,371 --> 00:18:12,904
You're the boss, the big-picture guy.

523
00:18:12,939 --> 00:18:15,574
Okay, you've got to be Max to the Max.

524
00:18:15,608 --> 00:18:16,575
Ah, yes.

525
00:18:16,609 --> 00:18:18,277
I've got to do what bosses do:

526
00:18:18,311 --> 00:18:20,612
take credit for other
people's achievements.

527
00:18:20,646 --> 00:18:22,414
Thank you, Hunter.

528
00:18:22,449 --> 00:18:24,216
I'm glad I thought of that.

529
00:18:24,250 --> 00:18:25,217
You lied to me.

530
00:18:25,251 --> 00:18:26,550
Because you lied to me.

531
00:18:26,585 --> 00:18:28,119
Oh, and I'll tell you something else.

532
00:18:28,153 --> 00:18:30,588
You suck at charades.

533
00:18:30,622 --> 00:18:32,423
Ha! That is laughable.

534
00:18:32,458 --> 00:18:34,392
Here's me pantomime-laughing at you.

535
00:18:36,295 --> 00:18:38,696
Oh, oh, and here's me looking confused

536
00:18:38,730 --> 00:18:40,398
because your pantomime sucks.

when I was in the bathroom.

Listen, Tippy, we don't...

Shh!

542
00:18:55,980 --> 00:19:00,082
I have never been so relieved
to taste soap in my life.

543
00:19:00,117 --> 00:19:03,285
Tippy, you and Sean are
never going to happen.

544
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:05,587
You're just jealous
because you had your chance

545
00:19:05,622 --> 00:19:07,356
and you lost him.

546
00:19:07,391 --> 00:19:08,690
Lost him?

547
00:19:08,725 --> 00:19:10,092
I... I didn't lose him.

548
00:19:10,127 --> 00:19:11,360
Sean, did I lose you?

549
00:19:11,395 --> 00:19:14,062
No, we just had a fight.

550
00:19:14,096 --> 00:19:15,430
You could never lose me,

551
00:19:15,464 --> 00:19:19,034
even if we were in that
maze from that movie, uh...

552
00:19:19,068 --> 00:19:20,635
[Snaps fingers] It was Valentine's Day.

553
00:19:20,669 --> 00:19:22,303
We ordered those dumplings.
I had that goatee.

554
00:19:22,338 --> 00:19:23,704
<i>- You told me it wasn't working.
- The Shining.</i>

555
00:19:23,739 --> 00:19:25,040
<i>That's it, the shining.</i>

556
00:19:25,074 --> 00:19:26,508
And I had to spend the night at your place

557
00:19:26,542 --> 00:19:28,209
because I was too afraid to go home.

558
00:19:28,244 --> 00:19:30,044
And you stayed there for
a week because there were...

559
00:19:30,078 --> 00:19:31,145
Both: Eight-year-old twins...

560
00:19:31,179 --> 00:19:32,646
- In your building.
- In my building.

561
00:19:34,749 --> 00:19:37,017
Tippy,

562
00:19:37,051 --> 00:19:41,087
if I were to ever wake up
on the wrong side of gay,

563
00:19:41,121 --> 00:19:42,721
this is the only woman I'd be with.

564
00:19:45,559 --> 00:19:46,559
Okay, Sean.

565
00:19:46,593 --> 00:19:48,127
It's your loss.

566
00:19:48,162 --> 00:19:50,163
It would've been a wild ride.

567
00:19:54,167 --> 00:19:55,633
So would I really be the only woman

568
00:19:55,668 --> 00:19:57,369
you'd want to be with?

569
00:19:57,403 --> 00:19:58,570
Of course.

570
00:19:58,604 --> 00:19:59,971
But just so we're clear,

571
00:20:00,005 --> 00:20:02,607
there's, like, a million
dudes in line ahead of you.

572
00:20:02,641 --> 00:20:03,942
And just so we're clear,

573
00:20:03,976 --> 00:20:07,679
there are, like, a million
dudes in line ahead of you.

574
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:09,513
And a couple chicks.

575
00:20:09,548 --> 00:20:10,581
You mean the waitress at the...

576
00:20:10,615 --> 00:20:12,383
Yeah.

577
00:20:12,417 --> 00:20:14,552
I'm sorry I cheated on you with Carl.

578
00:20:14,586 --> 00:20:17,555
Oh, I'm sorry I wasn't honest either.

579
00:20:17,589 --> 00:20:20,191
In my defense, I thought
I could get away with it.

580
00:20:23,462 --> 00:20:26,529
[Chuckling] Wild night.

581
00:20:26,564 --> 00:20:29,499
Hey, but at least we're going
to that J.T. concert together.

582
00:20:29,533 --> 00:20:32,402
- Oh, Sean.
- No?

583
00:20:32,436 --> 00:20:35,171
That was back when we
were lying to each other.

584
00:20:35,206 --> 00:20:36,339
Tippy?

585
00:20:36,373 --> 00:20:37,940
Tippy, is that you?

586
00:20:37,975 --> 00:20:39,509
Sorry, Lorna, it's just me.

587
00:20:39,543 --> 00:20:40,977
Oh, what?

588
00:20:41,044 --> 00:20:42,211
What's happening?

589
00:20:42,245 --> 00:20:44,980
Tippy and I have parted ways.

590
00:20:45,014 --> 00:20:47,216
Oh, I see.

591
00:20:47,250 --> 00:20:48,550
I got to get some water.

592
00:20:48,585 --> 00:20:50,852
Sorry, you're stuck with me again, Lorna.

593
00:20:50,886 --> 00:20:53,489
Oh, that's all right, Liz.

594
00:20:53,523 --> 00:20:55,557
I was getting tired of Tippy anyway.

595
00:20:55,592 --> 00:20:57,092
I'm glad to have you back.

596
00:20:57,126 --> 00:20:58,192
Aw.

597
00:20:58,227 --> 00:20:59,327
That's so sweet.

598
00:20:59,361 --> 00:21:01,028
Two of my favorite women
in the whole world...

599
00:21:01,062 --> 00:21:02,062
I was just being nice.

600
00:21:02,097 --> 00:21:03,063
I'm devastated.

601
00:21:03,098 --> 00:21:04,298
Good night.

602
