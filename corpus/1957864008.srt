00:11:33,693 --> 00:11:34,902
Excuse me, ma'am.

189
00:11:35,194 --> 00:11:36,821
Do you have any change?

190
00:11:37,405 --> 00:11:38,906
I know you do.

Hi. Hi. How's your night going?

200
00:12:13,149 --> 00:12:14,149
Good.

201
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:16,485
Oh, you don't need to
worry about that, Jessica.

202
00:12:16,610 --> 00:12:17,945
Oh, well, that makes it easy.

203
00:12:18,237 --> 00:12:22,700
Um, it's going good. I, you know,
just ran into a guy outside.

204
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:24,553
He asked for some money,
you know how it is.

205
00:12:24,577 --> 00:12:27,955
Oh, I apologize. It's a
real problem around here.

206
00:12:28,247 --> 00:12:31,167
It's no worries at all. I
always like helping him out.

207
00:12:31,417 --> 00:12:34,670
Gave him some money.
You know, $20.

208
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,631
Well, that is very kind of you.

209
00:12:38,215 --> 00:12:41,302
You can go ahead and have a seat.
They'll be starting shortly.

00:12:43,012 --> 00:12:44,597
Okay, did you Mark her here?

212
00:12:44,805 --> 00:12:46,599
It was Jessica.

213
00:12:46,849 --> 00:12:48,184
Hi again.

214
00:12:48,392 --> 00:12:49,518
Thank you for being here.

215
00:12:49,643 --> 00:12:52,313
Of course. You know,
I love these things.

216
00:12:52,521 --> 00:12:54,440
Can I see your ID please?

217
00:12:54,940 --> 00:12:56,192
Oh, yeah. Of course.

218
00:12:56,567 --> 00:12:58,611
Sorry. No, it's not.

219
00:12:58,819 --> 00:13:00,029
What's the matter?

220
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:02,406
Oh, nothing. I just need
to update your information.

221
00:13:02,782 --> 00:13:04,259
We had some issues
in our last video.

222
00:13:04,283 --> 00:13:06,803
Oh, the address on there is old.
I haven't updated it in years.

223
00:13:09,997 --> 00:13:11,832
Okay, look. I'm going
to level with you.

224
00:13:12,041 --> 00:13:14,251
We don't get a ton of people
with your income level.

225
00:13:14,460 --> 00:13:17,588
We have two tonight but they're
more interested in you than anybody.

226
00:13:17,797 --> 00:13:18,881
Oh.

227
00:13:19,590 --> 00:13:21,790
Try to make an impression
tonight. You know, stand out.

228
00:13:21,967 --> 00:13:25,429
Don't I always. Of
course. Thank you.

229
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:26,596
Hmm.

Cuz I swear. I… [Footsteps]

246
00:14:43,340 --> 00:14:44,140
Okay. Hey, everyone.

247
00:14:44,300 --> 00:14:47,261
My name is Aaron and I'm going to be
leading the discussion this evening.

248
00:14:47,511 --> 00:14:49,991
First thing I gotta get you to
do is turn those cellphones off.

249
00:14:50,055 --> 00:14:52,117
If you're afraid you can
get an emergency phone call,

250
00:14:52,141 --> 00:14:54,578
you can leave your cellphones at the
front desk and they'll notify you.

251
00:14:54,602 --> 00:14:57,730
Other than that, all
electronics have gotta be off.

252
00:14:58,439 --> 00:15:00,065
Okay, we're good.
Phones are off.

253
00:15:00,608 --> 00:15:02,359
Okay, let's head
back and we'll start.

[Music continues in the
background] [Footsteps]

255
00:15:11,243 --> 00:15:11,952
Alright, good.

256
00:15:12,244 --> 00:15:13,662
Great. Everyone
found their seats?

257
00:15:13,954 --> 00:15:14,622
Perfect.

258
00:15:14,955 --> 00:15:17,708
So, I'll introduce
myself real. [Man coughs]

259
00:15:18,250 --> 00:15:20,669
Are we good? Alright, we good?

260
00:15:20,920 --> 00:15:22,588
Yeah. Yeah.

261
00:15:22,671 --> 00:15:23,839
Anyway,

262
00:15:24,423 --> 00:15:27,103
I lead these discussions all around
the United States and the world

263
00:15:27,259 --> 00:15:29,803
and companies hire me to be
a dispassionate listener.

264
00:15:30,346 --> 00:15:32,386
Meaning, it's my job to get
unbiased information for

265
00:15:32,448 --> 00:15:34,706
those companies to use when
creating their new products.

266
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,853
So guys, tonight, I
have no vested interest.

267
00:15:38,062 --> 00:15:38,662
I'm not a cop.

268
00:15:38,745 --> 00:15:40,435
I just want to better

process when purchasing
consumer products.

270
00:15:42,483 --> 00:15:44,485
Make sense?
- Yeah?

271
00:15:44,568 --> 00:15:45,568
Yeah. Great.

272
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,101
Okay. So, let's get to
know you a bit better.

273
00:15:48,184 --> 00:15:50,532
Let's get a conversation
going, shall we?

274
00:15:51,575 --> 00:15:54,975
Let's start by just talking about what we
all do and what brings us together tonight.

275
00:15:55,245 --> 00:15:56,580
Who wants to go first?

276
00:15:57,206 --> 00:15:58,582
I'm cash.

277
00:15:59,458 --> 00:16:00,751
Michelle, right?

278
00:16:01,043 --> 00:16:01,643
Yeah.

279
00:16:01,835 --> 00:16:04,915
Well, it's a great incentive certainly
but that's not the only reason, right?

280
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,884
Matthew, why are
you here tonight?

281
00:16:09,301 --> 00:16:10,344
I'm a student.

282
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:11,261
You're a student?

283
00:16:11,512 --> 00:16:13,389
Great. Okay. Um and
what are you studying?

284
00:16:13,597 --> 00:16:14,348
Psychology?

285
00:16:14,431 --> 00:16:15,431
Psychology.

286
00:16:15,516 --> 00:16:16,116
Nice.

287
00:16:16,225 --> 00:16:18,345
Okay. Wait. Anybody in the
room need to be evaluated?

288
00:16:18,435 --> 00:16:19,937
Hey, whoa. Huh?

289
00:16:20,604 --> 00:16:21,730
I'm kidding.

290
00:16:21,939 --> 00:16:22,939
Kidding.

291
00:16:23,232 --> 00:16:24,672
So, being a student
brings you here.

292
00:16:24,733 --> 00:16:27,236
I mean, cash just like she said.

293
00:16:27,611 --> 00:16:28,611
Told you.

294
00:16:28,696 --> 00:16:30,030
Oh, okay. Fantastic.

295
00:16:30,364 --> 00:16:32,533
Great. Um what
about you, Michael?

296
00:16:33,701 --> 00:16:35,202
Is that thing on?

Oh, yeah. We record
all the sessions.

Oh, well, I don't think
I should tell them.

Oh, oh, it's just for
review purposes only. It's

internal. Don't worry,
completely confidential.

00:16:45,587 --> 00:16:47,589
Okay, I want a boat.

302
00:16:47,965 --> 00:16:49,717
Oh, that's interesting.
Um, what kind?

303
00:16:50,175 --> 00:16:51,593
Big boat.

304
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:56,640
Oh, okay. Uh great. A big boat.

305
00:16:57,182 --> 00:16:58,182
Now, let's see.

306
00:16:58,267 --> 00:17:00,853
Uh Jessica, what do
you do for a living?

307
00:17:01,353 --> 00:17:02,688
Uh I'm an attorney.

308
00:17:02,896 --> 00:17:03,981
Really?

309
00:17:04,648 --> 00:17:05,733
What firm?

310
00:17:05,941 --> 00:17:07,526
Oh, it's a smaller firm.

311
00:17:07,651 --> 00:17:08,651
Okay, great.

312
00:17:08,819 --> 00:17:09,987
Which one?

313
00:17:11,321 --> 00:17:13,198
I'm a partner. Oh, partner.

314
00:17:13,407 --> 00:17:14,616
Okay, so what brings you here?

315
00:17:14,825 --> 00:17:20,372
Well, honestly, I am here to maybe
field some potential clients.

316
00:17:20,581 --> 00:17:23,459
Anybody here need
legal representation?

317
00:17:25,252 --> 00:17:27,981
I think I might have something for
you. If you take government contract.

318
00:17:28,005 --> 00:17:30,549
Well, a partner is
very impressive.

319
00:17:30,632 --> 00:17:33,218

this going to take?

to the questionnaire

I just started at this
new gig a week ago.

Well it's really important
that you specify.

They're very particular about the
occupations that you have here.

going to be an issue.

been there before.

Okay. How do we not
know each other?

You know, actually. Michelle,

358

can I have you grab your things
and meet me out here, please?

fucking kidding me.

Emily, since you seem
to know all of this,

would you enlighten us with the
definition of morality please?

582
00:33:02,397 --> 00:33:06,447
Morality is the
differentiation of intentions,

between wrong and right.

Yes, in some cases,
you’re exactly right.

Uh ethics refers to rules
defined by an external source.

are the internal rules.

Ethically, it is
wrong to kill someone.
