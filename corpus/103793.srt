He was with us in the terminal.

PETER: We were in a hurry.
We ran all the way to the gate.

he was missing?

our baggage here.

this has happened before.

we never lose our luggage.

by accident last year.

that's what my wife meant...

when she said
it's a family travel tradition.

334
00:22:18,804 --> 00:22:22,296
We'll call Chicago and, uh...
notify them of the situation.

335
00:22:22,374 --> 00:22:25,172
The odds are that's where he is.

337
00:22:27,279 --> 00:22:30,339

he'd be anywhere else.

356
00:23:45,957 --> 00:23:47,117
MARV: Arizona?

357
00:23:52,364 --> 00:23:54,764
That's very smart, Marv.

358
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:57,894
You bust out of jail to rob
fourteen cents from Santa Claus?

359
00:23:57,969 --> 00:23:59,436
Every little bit helps.

360
00:23:59,471 --> 00:24:02,463
Besides,
now we got our new nickname.

361
00:24:02,541 --> 00:24:04,600
We're the Sticky Bandits.

362
00:24:05,510 --> 00:24:07,569
Real cute.

363
00:24:07,612 --> 00:24:08,909

MARV: What's the matter?

368
00:25:43,642 --> 00:25:45,166
HARRY: Thought I saw something.

369
00:25:54,586 --> 00:25:56,713
Pardonnez-moi, mon cherie.

370
00:25:58,623 --> 00:26:00,022

371
00:26:01,159 --> 00:26:02,854
HARRY: Serves you right.
Come on, let's go!

372
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,123
MARV: I think she likes me.

373
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:08,560
Ahh.

374
00:26:43,001 --> 00:26:44,434
Excuse me. Where's the lobby?

375
00:26:44,502 --> 00:26:46,094
Down the hall and to the left.

376
00:26:46,171 --> 00:26:47,536
Thanks.

377
00:27:01,119 --> 00:27:02,780

little refrigerators...

387
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,417
you have to open with a key.

388
00:27:41,059 --> 00:27:43,027
Credit card? You got it.

389
00:27:46,698 --> 00:27:49,258
Plaza hotel reservations.
May I help you?

and one of those

395
00:28:01,246 --> 00:28:03,214
you have to open with a key.

396
00:28:03,248 --> 00:28:05,910
Sir, you'll need a major
credit card upon check-in.

CONClERGE: Yes, two at 8:00,
Henri--Mr. Yamamoto.

400
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:20,357
Hold on a second.

401
00:28:25,070 --> 00:28:26,469
I'll call you back, Henri.

402
00:28:29,007 --> 00:28:30,133
Hi.

403
00:28:35,046 --> 00:28:36,536
Can I help you?

404
00:28:36,581 --> 00:28:38,640
Reservation for McCallister?

405
00:28:40,552 --> 00:28:42,782
A reservation for yourself?

406
00:28:42,821 --> 00:28:45,517
Ma'am, my feet are hardly
touching the ground.

407
00:28:45,557 --> 00:28:47,457
I'm barely able
to look over this counter.

408
00:28:47,492 --> 00:28:50,222
How could I make
a hotel reservation?

409
00:28:50,261 --> 00:28:51,455
Think about it--

410
00:28:51,496 --> 00:28:54,488
a kid going into a hotel,
making a reservation?

411
00:28:54,532 --> 00:28:56,625
I don't think so.

412
00:28:57,969 --> 00:28:59,800
I'm confused.

413
00:28:59,838 --> 00:29:01,362
I'm traveling with my dad.

414
00:29:01,439 --> 00:29:03,737
He's on business.
He's at a meeting.

415
00:29:03,775 --> 00:29:05,072
I hate meetings...

416
00:29:05,110 --> 00:29:06,873
plus I'm not allowed to go in.

417
00:29:06,911 --> 00:29:08,276
I can only sit in the lobby.

418
00:29:08,313 --> 00:29:09,439
That's boring...

419
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,472
so my dad dropped me off here.

420
00:29:12,684 --> 00:29:13,810
He gave me his credit card...

421
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:15,820
and said whoever
was checking people in...

422
00:29:15,854 --> 00:29:17,378
to let me in the hotel room...

423
00:29:17,422 --> 00:29:19,481
so I won't get into mischief...

424
00:29:19,524 --> 00:29:21,992
and, ma'am, sometimes I do
get into mischief.

425
00:29:23,194 --> 00:29:25,389
We all do!

426
00:29:27,699 --> 00:29:29,030
OFFlCER: Merry Christmas.

427
00:29:31,035 --> 00:29:32,332
No sign of him.

428
00:29:32,403 --> 00:29:34,928
We'll have to be able
to get ahold of you.

429
00:29:35,006 --> 00:29:37,304
-You have hotel arrangements?
-Yeah.

430
00:29:37,342 --> 00:29:40,038
Do you have
a recent photo of the boy?

431
00:29:41,913 --> 00:29:43,312
PETER: I have one in my wallet.

432
00:29:44,749 --> 00:29:46,307
I don't have my wallet.

433
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,218
My wallet's in my bag.

434
00:29:50,255 --> 00:29:51,882
Kevin was looking in my bag
at the airport.

435
00:29:51,923 --> 00:29:54,016
He was looking for batteries.
Kevin has my wallet.

436
00:29:54,058 --> 00:29:55,923
Did you have credit cards
in the wallet?

437
00:29:55,960 --> 00:29:57,359
Credit cards, money.

438
00:29:57,395 --> 00:29:59,955
We'll notify
the credit card companies.

439
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,124
If your son has the cards...

440
00:30:01,166 --> 00:30:04,693
we can get a location on him
when and if he uses them.

441
00:30:04,769 --> 00:30:07,863
I don't think Kevin even knows
how to use a credit card.

442
00:30:10,642 --> 00:30:11,904
Wow! It worked.

443
00:30:16,047 --> 00:30:18,140
-Cedric.
-Yes?

444
00:30:18,183 --> 00:30:20,549
Don't count your tips
in public...

445
00:30:21,853 --> 00:30:25,949

about that young fellow.

Enjoy your stay with us.

448
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:38,861
Don't forget to remind your dad
when he arrives...

449
00:30:38,937 --> 00:30:41,428
that he has to come down
and sign a couple of things.

450
00:30:41,506 --> 00:30:43,872

This is one of our
finest suites, sir.

00:31:14,606 --> 00:31:16,301
This is great!

Wow! A huge bed just for me!

460
00:31:31,856 --> 00:31:32,982

461
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,423

462
00:31:41,032 --> 00:31:42,693
How convenient!

Hey!

464
00:31:49,841 --> 00:31:51,274
Did you want me
to put the key in the bag...

465
00:31:52,176 --> 00:31:53,609
or did you just want
to hang on to it?

466
00:31:53,645 --> 00:31:55,237
I'll hang on to it.

467
00:31:58,650 --> 00:32:00,345
Is everything all right, sir?

468
00:32:00,385 --> 00:32:01,647
Is the temperature
in the room OK?

469
00:32:01,686 --> 00:32:02,812
It's OK.

470
00:32:02,854 --> 00:32:04,378
Do you know how the TV works?

471
00:32:04,422 --> 00:32:06,913
I'm ten years old. TV's my life.

472
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:09,086
Well...

473
00:32:13,231 --> 00:32:14,357
Oh, I'm sorry.

474
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,799
And there's plenty more
where that came from.

I was singin'
at the Blue Monkey last night.

She was not! She was smooching
with your brother.

Mr. Duncan is donating it
to the Children's Hospital...

717
00:47:55,639 --> 00:47:57,937
and the day after Christmas...

718

we empty all the money
in the cash register...

719
00:48:01,211 --> 00:48:04,669

right down to the hospital.

needs it more than I do.

when we had the chance.

of the same thing.

If you aren't going
to use your heart...

1055
01:11:20,309 --> 01:11:22,300
then what's the difference
if it gets broken?

1056
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,278
If you just keep it
to yourself...

1057
01:11:24,313 --> 01:11:26,543
maybe it'll be like
my roller blades--

1058
01:11:26,582 --> 01:11:28,550
when you do decide to try it...

1059
01:11:28,584 --> 01:11:30,211
it won't be any good.

1060
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:31,719
You should take a chance.

1061
01:11:31,754 --> 01:11:33,278
You got nothing to lose.

1062

A bit of truth in there
somewhere.

1063
01:11:36,659 --> 01:11:38,126

might still be broken...

01:11:39,895 --> 01:11:41,362
but it isn't gone.

1066
01:11:41,397 --> 01:11:43,888
If it was gone,
you wouldn't be this nice.

1067
01:11:44,933 --> 01:11:46,298
Thank you.

1068
01:11:48,871 --> 01:11:50,099
Do you know that it's been...

1069
01:11:51,874 --> 01:11:54,638
a couple of years
since I've talked to anybody?

1070
01:11:54,677 --> 01:11:57,077
That's OK.
You're really good at it.

1071
01:11:57,112 --> 01:11:58,238
You're not boring.

1072
01:11:58,280 --> 01:12:00,077
You don't mumble or spit
when you talk.

1073
01:12:00,115 --> 01:12:02,242
You should do it more often.

1074
01:12:02,284 --> 01:12:03,581
You just have to wear
an outfit...

1075
01:12:03,619 --> 01:12:05,211
that doesn't have
pigeon poop on it.

1076
01:12:05,254 --> 01:12:07,245
[Woman laughs]

1077
01:12:08,257 --> 01:12:09,724
Oh, I have been working
very hard...

1078
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:12,249
at keeping people away,
haven't l?

1079
01:12:12,294 --> 01:12:15,024
I always think I'll have
a lot of fun if I'm alone...

1080
01:12:15,064 --> 01:12:17,464
but being alone isn't much fun.

1081
01:12:17,533 --> 01:12:20,229
I don't care how much
people bug me sometimes...

1082
01:12:20,302 --> 01:12:23,328
I'd rather be with somebody
than by myself.

1083
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:25,830
So what are you doing
running around the streets...

1084
01:12:25,908 --> 01:12:27,341
on Christmas Eve alone?

1085
01:12:27,376 --> 01:12:29,344
Did you get into trouble?

1086
01:12:29,378 --> 01:12:31,437
Yeah.

1087
01:12:31,480 --> 01:12:33,004
WOMAN:
You've done something wrong?

1088
01:12:33,048 --> 01:12:34,572
A lot of things.

1089
01:12:36,985 --> 01:12:40,648
Did you know that a good deed
erases a bad deed?

1090
01:12:40,689 --> 01:12:42,122
It's getting pretty late.

1091
01:12:42,157 --> 01:12:44,182
I don't know
if I'll have enough time...

1092
01:12:44,226 --> 01:12:46,888
to erase
all the bad deeds I did.

1093
01:12:46,929 --> 01:12:48,726
Well, it's Christmas Eve.

1094
01:12:48,764 --> 01:12:50,527
Good deeds
count for extra tonight.

1095
01:12:50,599 --> 01:12:53,591
-They do?
-Of course they do.

1096
01:12:53,669 --> 01:12:55,899
So you must think
of the most important thing...

1097
01:12:55,938 --> 01:12:57,462
that you can do for others...

1098
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,166
and go and do it.

1099
01:12:59,975 --> 01:13:02,170
Just follow the star
in your own heart.

1100
01:13:03,779 --> 01:13:05,269
OK.

1101
01:13:06,281 --> 01:13:07,748
It's getting pretty late.

1102
01:13:07,783 --> 01:13:09,273
I better get going.

1103
01:13:16,458 --> 01:13:19,757
If I don't see you again,
I hope everything turns out OK.

1104
01:13:19,795 --> 01:13:21,126
Thank you.

1105
01:13:22,331 --> 01:13:23,889
Say good-bye to your birds
for me.

1106
01:13:23,966 --> 01:13:25,092
Oh, I will.

1107
01:13:33,809 --> 01:13:34,935
Merry Christmas.

1108
01:13:34,977 --> 01:13:36,376
Merry Christmas.

1109
01:13:36,412 --> 01:13:39,870
If you need somebody to trust,
it can be me.

1110
01:13:39,915 --> 01:13:42,247
I won't forget to remember you.

1111
01:13:43,285 --> 01:13:45,253
Don't make promises
you can't keep.

1112
01:14:01,069 --> 01:14:07,736
CHlLDREN SlNGlNG: Distant stars
at home up in the heavens

1113
01:14:07,776 --> 01:14:11,234
Wonder what they see

1114
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:14,738
Are they watching me?

1115
01:14:14,783 --> 01:14:17,752
Christmas star

1116
01:14:17,786 --> 01:14:22,086
You watch the world so wisely

1117
01:14:22,124 --> 01:14:26,060
At my journey's end

1118
01:14:26,094 --> 01:14:29,154
Will you be my true friend?

1119
01:14:29,231 --> 01:14:32,997
Starlight, shine bright

1120
01:14:33,068 --> 01:14:37,004
See me through the dark night

1121
01:14:37,072 --> 01:14:40,838
Light my pathway

1122
01:14:40,876 --> 01:14:44,368
Guide me home for Christmas

1123
01:14:44,413 --> 01:14:46,711
DUNCAN: All the money
in the cash register...

1124
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:50,411
Mr. Duncan is going to donate
to the Children's Hospital.

1125
01:14:51,019 --> 01:14:54,682
MARV: At midnight tonight, we're
hitting Duncan's Toy Chest.

1126
01:14:54,723 --> 01:14:56,714
You can mess
with a lot of things...

1127
01:14:56,758 --> 01:14:59,727
but you can't mess with kids
on Christmas.

1128
01:17:20,268 --> 01:17:21,360
CONClERGE:
We'd like to offer you...

1129
01:17:21,436 --> 01:17:23,529
a complimentary suite
while you're here.

1130
01:17:24,272 --> 01:17:26,740
It's a penthouse
with a view of the park.

1131
01:17:26,775 --> 01:17:27,901
I think
you'll find it satisfactory.

1132
01:17:27,943 --> 01:17:31,470
It was recently vacated by
the Countess of Worcestershire.

1133
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:34,846
What kind of hotel allows
a child to check in alone?

1134
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:37,545
The boy had a very
convincing story.

1135
01:17:37,586 --> 01:17:39,986
What kind of idiots
are working here?

1136
01:17:40,656 --> 01:17:43,489
The finest in New York.

1137
01:17:43,525 --> 01:17:45,891
PETER: When you discovered
the credit card was stolen--

1138
01:17:45,927 --> 01:17:48,020
I made the discovery.

1139
01:17:48,063 --> 01:17:49,587
Why did you let him leave?

1140
01:17:50,599 --> 01:17:52,590
When we attempted
to confront him, he ran.

1141
01:17:52,668 --> 01:17:53,828
You scared him away.

1142
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:56,029
KATE: It's Christmas Eve,
and because of you...

1143
01:17:56,104 --> 01:17:58,572
our child is lost in one of
the biggest cities in the world.

1144
01:18:02,411 --> 01:18:04,936
Could you take our family
and our luggage up to the room?

1145
01:18:04,980 --> 01:18:06,379
Yes, sir.

1146
01:18:06,415 --> 01:18:07,814
Run along, Cedric.

1147
01:18:07,849 --> 01:18:09,544
I'm going down
to the police station...

1148
01:18:09,584 --> 01:18:11,711
and make sure
they're trying to find Kevin.

1149
01:18:11,753 --> 01:18:13,550
I want you to stay
with the kids.

1150
01:18:13,588 --> 01:18:16,079
-No. I'm going to look for him.
-What?

1151
01:18:16,124 --> 01:18:17,557
With all due respect, madam...

1152
01:18:17,592 --> 01:18:20,390
your son is lost in one of
the biggest cities in the world.

1153
01:18:21,530 --> 01:18:23,498
Could you stay out of this,
please?

1154
01:18:23,565 --> 01:18:25,123
As you wish.

1155
01:18:25,200 --> 01:18:27,532
Thank you. I don't think
it's a good idea...

1156
01:18:27,569 --> 01:18:30,436
for you to run around
New York City all by yourself.

1157
01:18:30,472 --> 01:18:32,337
If our son can do it,
I can do it.

1158
01:18:32,374 --> 01:18:33,671
Peter, I'll be fine.

1159
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:34,835
The way I'm feeling...

1160
01:18:34,876 --> 01:18:36,867
no mugger or murderer
would dare mess with me.

1161
01:18:38,346 --> 01:18:40,610
CONClERGE: Madam, there are
hundreds of parasites...

1162
01:18:40,649 --> 01:18:41,980
armed to the teeth--

1163
01:18:44,319 --> 01:18:46,810
Do bundle up.
It's awfully cold outside.

1164
01:18:52,728 --> 01:18:54,719
[Clock chiming]

1165
01:19:21,690 --> 01:19:24,090
Marv, Marv, come on. Let's go.

1166
01:19:45,680 --> 01:19:47,113
Marv...

1167
01:19:47,149 --> 01:19:48,309
crowbars up.

1168
01:19:54,222 --> 01:19:55,985
Merry Christmas, Harry.

1169
01:20:00,796 --> 01:20:03,287
Happy Hanukkah, Marv.

1170
01:20:12,674 --> 01:20:15,768
MARV: This is more money
than I can even count.

1171
01:20:15,811 --> 01:20:18,041
HARRY: Makes you wonder
why we spent so much time...

1172
01:20:18,079 --> 01:20:19,205
robbing private homes.

1173
01:20:19,247 --> 01:20:20,805
MARV: Ha ha!

1174
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:37,060
MARV: The amazing thing is,
we're fugitives from the law...

1175
01:20:37,132 --> 01:20:39,498
we're up to our elbows
in cash...

1176
01:20:39,534 --> 01:20:41,126
and nobody even knows about it.

1177
01:20:45,440 --> 01:20:46,907
He's back!

1178
01:20:48,276 --> 01:20:49,743
He took our picture!

1179
01:20:49,778 --> 01:20:51,336
How did my hair look?

1180
01:20:57,319 --> 01:20:58,809
KEVlN: This is it.

1181
01:20:58,854 --> 01:21:00,344
No turning back.

1182
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,187
Another Christmas
in the trenches.

1183
01:21:05,126 --> 01:21:08,857
No!

1184
01:21:10,332 --> 01:21:12,323
[Alarm bell ringing]

1185
01:21:12,400 --> 01:21:13,765
Wow.

1186
01:21:13,802 --> 01:21:15,269
HARRY: That's it. Get the money!

1187
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,770
I'll kill him!

1188
01:21:16,805 --> 01:21:18,705
That little friggin'
son of a dirty...

1189
01:21:26,414 --> 01:21:28,177
-I'm coming, Harry!
-Marv!

1190
01:21:28,717 --> 01:21:34,656
HARRY: Aah!

1191
01:21:37,359 --> 01:21:38,621
Harry?

1192
01:21:38,660 --> 01:21:40,855
Uhhh...

1193
01:21:40,896 --> 01:21:42,124
Harry!

1194
01:21:43,265 --> 01:21:44,357
That was incredible!

1195
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,900
[Mutters]

1196
01:21:48,403 --> 01:21:50,268
I twisted my ankle
on that board there.

1197
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,399
-Where is he?
-Hey, guys, smile!

1198
01:21:55,744 --> 01:21:57,371
HARRY: Come on. Come on!

1199
01:21:57,412 --> 01:21:58,538
Help me.

1200
01:21:58,580 --> 01:21:59,877
MARV: I got you.

1201
01:21:59,915 --> 01:22:01,075
I got you.

1202
01:22:27,542 --> 01:22:29,032
Taxi!

1203
01:22:35,250 --> 01:22:36,410
Times Square.

1204
01:22:58,273 --> 01:22:59,638
MARV: Where'd he go?

1205
01:23:01,910 --> 01:23:03,901
KEVlN:
I'm up here! Come and get me!

1206
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:06,846
Let's kill!

1207
01:23:06,881 --> 01:23:08,576
Hold on, pea-brain.

1208
01:23:08,616 --> 01:23:09,844
We got busted last time...

1209
01:23:09,884 --> 01:23:12,318
because we underestimated
that little bundle of misery.

1210
01:23:12,354 --> 01:23:14,049
This ain't like the last time.

1211
01:23:14,089 --> 01:23:16,319
This ain't his house.
The kid's running scared.

1212
01:23:16,391 --> 01:23:18,052
He ain't got a plan.

1213
01:23:19,260 --> 01:23:20,989
May I do the thinking, please?

1214
01:23:22,731 --> 01:23:23,891
Thank you.

1215
01:23:26,334 --> 01:23:27,460
Sonny!

1216
01:23:27,502 --> 01:23:28,969
Yes?

1217
01:23:29,004 --> 01:23:31,472
HARRY: Nothing would thrill me
more greatly...

1218
01:23:31,506 --> 01:23:32,973
than to shoot you.

1219
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,475
Knocking off a youngster...

1220
01:23:34,509 --> 01:23:37,342
ain't going to mean
all that much to me, understand?

1221
01:23:37,379 --> 01:23:38,505
KEVlN: Mm-hmm.

1222
01:23:38,546 --> 01:23:42,107
But since we're in a hurry,
I'll make a deal with you.

1223
01:23:42,150 --> 01:23:44,311
You throw down your camera...

1224
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,820
and we won't hurt you.

1225
01:23:46,855 --> 01:23:49,619
You'll never hear from us again.

1226
01:23:49,691 --> 01:23:51,158
OK?

1227
01:23:51,192 --> 01:23:52,557
You promise?

1228
01:23:53,294 --> 01:23:56,821
I cross my heart
and hope to die.

1229
01:23:56,898 --> 01:23:58,729
OK.

1230
01:24:04,572 --> 01:24:07,234
OK, kid, give it to me.

1231
01:24:14,182 --> 01:24:16,082
MARV: Ohh...

1232
01:24:16,117 --> 01:24:17,311
Direct hit!

1233
01:24:23,458 --> 01:24:25,449
How many fingers
am I holding up, Marv?

1234
01:24:27,395 --> 01:24:28,521
Eight?

1235
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:34,931
OK, kid.
You want to throw bricks?

1236
01:24:34,969 --> 01:24:36,527
Go ahead!
Throw another one!

1237
01:24:42,243 --> 01:24:44,108
If you can't do any better
than that, kid...

1238
01:24:44,145 --> 01:24:45,669

01:44:10,844 --> 01:44:12,573
[Harry muttering]

1422
01:44:15,515 --> 01:44:22,751
Aah!

1423
01:44:24,758 --> 01:44:25,986
Bye! Thanks!

1424
01:44:46,280 --> 01:44:48,248
[Siren]

1425
01:44:52,386 --> 01:44:54,718
OFFlCER: Jeez, it looks like
the Fourth of July!

1426
01:44:55,956 --> 01:44:58,015
We'll take the bridge.
You guys get the tunnel.

1427
01:44:58,058 --> 01:44:59,548
Let's go. Come on!

1428
01:45:02,195 --> 01:45:03,685
[Harry and Marv muttering]

1429
01:45:07,301 --> 01:45:08,996
Oh, my God!

1430
01:45:09,036 --> 01:45:10,367
[Gunshot]

1431
01:45:19,646 --> 01:45:21,045
OFFlCER:
All right, you guys, let's go.

1432
01:45:21,081 --> 01:45:23,015
SECOND OFFlCER:
Come on. On yourfeet.

1433
01:45:23,050 --> 01:45:24,210
HARRY: Take it easy.

1434
01:45:28,021 --> 01:45:30,251
OFFlCER: You guys
should've started earlier.

1435
01:45:30,290 --> 01:45:32,520
The prisoners
have already exchanged gifts.

1436
01:45:32,559 --> 01:45:34,527
MARV: We missed the presents?

1437
01:45:34,561 --> 01:45:35,926
He made us hide out
in a store...

1438
01:45:35,962 --> 01:45:38,590
so we could steal
the charity money.

1439
01:45:38,632 --> 01:45:40,429
-Shut up, Marv!
-Aah!

1440
01:45:41,435 --> 01:45:43,801
HARRY: You got the right
to remain silent, you know.

1441
01:45:44,705 --> 01:45:45,933
He's a little cranky.

1442
01:45:46,006 --> 01:45:47,701
We just broke out of prison
a few days ago.

1443
01:45:47,774 --> 01:45:50,436
Shut up, Marv! Jeez!

1444
01:45:50,510 --> 01:45:52,774
-Get them out of here.
-Let's go.

1445
01:45:52,813 --> 01:45:54,508
MARV: Remember,
if this makes the papers...

1446
01:45:54,548 --> 01:45:56,106
we're no longer the Wet Bandits.

1447
01:45:56,149 --> 01:45:57,776
We're the Sticky Bandits!

1448
01:45:57,818 --> 01:46:00,412
Ow! That's Sticky!
That's "S"...

1449
01:46:00,454 --> 01:46:01,580
HARRY: Shut it!

1450
01:46:01,621 --> 01:46:02,952
MARV: "T," uh...

1451
01:46:02,989 --> 01:46:05,116
-"l."
-"l."

1452
01:46:17,003 --> 01:46:18,493
OFFlCER:
Mr. Duncan, it's all over.

1453
01:46:18,538 --> 01:46:20,699
We apprehended the thieves,
and we recovered your money.

1454
01:46:20,774 --> 01:46:22,036
DUNCAN: Good.
I want to get that money...

1455
01:46:22,109 --> 01:46:24,509
over to the Children's Hospital.

1456
01:46:24,544 --> 01:46:26,034
OFFlCER:
I'll handle it personally.

1457
01:46:26,113 --> 01:46:27,580
DUNCAN: Thank you very much.

1458
01:46:27,614 --> 01:46:29,377
INSPECTOR:
Excuse me, Mr. Duncan.

1459
01:46:29,416 --> 01:46:30,849
I found this note.

1460
01:46:30,884 --> 01:46:32,818
Looks like a kid
broke your window.

1461
01:46:49,736 --> 01:46:52,398
Turtledoves.

1462
01:46:52,472 --> 01:46:53,632
Ohh.

1463
01:47:01,081 --> 01:47:02,776
KATE: Oh, excuse me.
I'm looking for my son.

1464
01:47:02,816 --> 01:47:04,113
He's this boy right here.

1465
01:47:06,586 --> 01:47:07,848
Excuse me. Please help me.

1466
01:47:07,921 --> 01:47:09,047
This boy right here,
have you seen him?

1467
01:47:09,122 --> 01:47:10,919
This one. Please?

1468
01:47:19,533 --> 01:47:21,000
I'm looking for my son.

1469
01:47:21,034 --> 01:47:23,002
He's been missing
for two days.

1470
01:47:23,036 --> 01:47:24,503
OFFlCER:
Have you filed a report?

1471
01:47:24,538 --> 01:47:26,005
KATE: Yes, of course we have.

1472
01:47:28,108 --> 01:47:29,473
Then trust us.

1473
01:47:29,509 --> 01:47:30,669
We'll handle it.

1474
01:47:32,579 --> 01:47:33,739
Oh.

1475
01:47:36,049 --> 01:47:37,209
But I'm his mother.

1476
01:47:38,919 --> 01:47:40,011
I realize that, ma'am...

1477
01:47:40,086 --> 01:47:41,576
but you're looking
for a needle in a haystack.

1478
01:47:42,756 --> 01:47:44,246
Do you have kids?

1479
01:47:45,325 --> 01:47:46,451
Yes, ma'am.

1480
01:47:46,493 --> 01:47:48,461
And what would you do
if one of them was missing?

1481
01:47:50,464 --> 01:47:53,558
I'd probably be doing
the same thing you're doing.

1482
01:47:54,568 --> 01:47:55,728
Thank you.

1483
01:47:58,338 --> 01:48:00,465
Look, put yourself
in your kid's shoes.

1484
01:48:00,507 --> 01:48:02,873
Where would you go?
What would you do?

1485
01:48:02,909 --> 01:48:06,003
Me? I'd probably be lying dead
in a gutter somewhere.

1486
01:48:07,514 --> 01:48:08,947
Oh, but not Kevin.

1487
01:48:08,982 --> 01:48:12,748
No. Kevin is so much stronger
and braver than I am.

1488
01:48:14,154 --> 01:48:16,486
I know Kevin's fine.
I'm sure he is.

1489
01:48:16,523 --> 01:48:18,320
Fine.

1490
01:48:18,358 --> 01:48:20,519
But he's still all by himself
in a big city...

1491
01:48:21,895 --> 01:48:23,726
and he doesn't deserve that.

1492
01:48:23,763 --> 01:48:26,391
He deserves to be at home
with his own family...

1493
01:48:26,433 --> 01:48:28,094
around his Christmas tree.

1494
01:48:31,771 --> 01:48:33,102
Oh, dear God.

1495
01:48:34,374 --> 01:48:35,602
I know where he is.

1496
01:48:36,576 --> 01:48:38,100
I need to get
to Rockefeller Center.

1497
01:48:39,045 --> 01:48:40,171
Hop in.

1498
01:48:40,213 --> 01:48:41,737
Thank you.

1499
01:48:45,986 --> 01:48:48,045
KEVlN: I know I don't deserve
a Christmas...

1500
01:48:48,121 --> 01:48:50,089
even if I did do a good deed.

1501
01:48:51,124 --> 01:48:52,682
I don't want any presents.

1502
01:48:52,759 --> 01:48:54,488
Instead, I want to take back...

1503
01:48:54,528 --> 01:48:57,190
every mean thing
I ever said to my family....

1504
01:48:57,230 --> 01:48:59,460
even if they don't take back
the things they said.

1505
01:48:59,499 --> 01:49:01,899
I don't care.
I'll love all of them...

1506
01:49:02,903 --> 01:49:04,530
including Buzz.

1507
01:49:04,571 --> 01:49:08,337
If I can only see one,
can I see my mother?

1508
01:49:08,375 --> 01:49:11,902
I'll never want another thing
as long as I live.

1509
01:49:11,945 --> 01:49:13,412
I just want my mother.

1510
01:49:13,446 --> 01:49:15,346
I know I won't see her
tonight...

1511
01:49:15,382 --> 01:49:17,907
but promise me
I can see her again...

1512
01:49:17,951 --> 01:49:19,942
sometime, anytime.

1513
01:49:19,986 --> 01:49:23,922
Even if it's just once and only
for a couple of minutes.

1514
01:49:23,990 --> 01:49:26,288
I just need to tell her
I'm sorry.

1515
01:49:34,367 --> 01:49:35,527
Kevin?

1516
01:49:42,342 --> 01:49:43,502
Mom?

1517
01:49:46,212 --> 01:49:47,907
Wow. That worked fast.

1518
01:49:58,558 --> 01:49:59,855
KATE: Oh, Kevin.

1519
01:50:01,728 --> 01:50:03,628
Mom, I'm sorry.

1520
01:50:05,165 --> 01:50:06,655
I'm sorry, too.

1521
01:50:19,546 --> 01:50:21,207
KEVlN: Merry Christmas, Mom.

1522
01:50:23,550 --> 01:50:25,677
KATE:
Merry Christmas, sweetheart.

1523
01:50:26,720 --> 01:50:28,085
Thank you.

1524
01:50:29,155 --> 01:50:30,383
Let's go.

1525
01:50:31,391 --> 01:50:32,858
KEVlN:
How'd you know I was here?

1526
01:50:32,926 --> 01:50:34,154
KATE: I know you
and Christmas trees...

1527
01:50:34,194 --> 01:50:35,786
and this is the biggest around.

1528
01:50:35,829 --> 01:50:37,023
KEVlN: Where's everybody else?

1529
01:50:37,063 --> 01:50:38,189
KATE: They're at the hotel.

1530
01:50:38,231 --> 01:50:39,892
They didn't like
the palm trees, either.

1531
01:51:02,455 --> 01:51:03,888
[Snoring]

1532
01:51:24,044 --> 01:51:26,774
Holy smokes! It's morning!

1533
01:51:28,148 --> 01:51:29,945
It's Christmas morning, man.

1534
01:51:31,384 --> 01:51:33,682
Fuller, don't get your hopes up.

1535
01:51:33,753 --> 01:51:35,243
FULLER: Huh?

1536
01:51:35,321 --> 01:51:37,255
I don't think
Santa Claus visits hotels.

1537
01:51:37,290 --> 01:51:39,758
Are you nuts? He's omnipresent.

1538
01:51:39,826 --> 01:51:41,521
He goes everywhere.

1539
01:51:43,163 --> 01:51:45,063
Hey, guys, wake up!
It's Christmas!

1540
01:51:49,736 --> 01:51:50,862
Mom, Dad, it's Christmas!

1541
01:51:50,904 --> 01:51:52,064
FRANK: What?!

1542
01:51:55,675 --> 01:51:56,937
GlRL: What on earth?

1543
01:51:56,976 --> 01:51:58,466
JEFF: Come on. I wanna find out.

1544
01:52:03,983 --> 01:52:05,644
ROD: Oh, wow.

1545
01:52:05,719 --> 01:52:07,687
JEFF:
Where did it all come from?

1546
01:52:07,721 --> 01:52:09,780
KEVlN:
Mom! Dad! You got to see this!

1547
01:52:14,394 --> 01:52:16,294
-Gosh.
-Peter!

1548
01:52:16,329 --> 01:52:17,694
BUZZ: Are you sure
we're in the right room?

1549
01:52:19,032 --> 01:52:21,227
-Look at all this stuff!
-Yeah!

1550
01:52:21,267 --> 01:52:23,360
-Oh, wow!
-Look!

1551
01:52:24,037 --> 01:52:25,698
FRANK: Don't open any of mine.
I mean it.

1552
01:52:25,739 --> 01:52:27,206
Who's Mr. Duncan?

1553
01:52:27,240 --> 01:52:29,299
KATE: Duncan? I don't know.

1554
01:52:29,342 --> 01:52:30,639
All right.
Everyone just calm down.

1555
01:52:30,677 --> 01:52:33,373
Calm down. Hey, hey!

1556
01:52:33,413 --> 01:52:35,438
All right. Now...

1557
01:52:35,482 --> 01:52:40,215
if Kevin hadn't screwed up
in the first place again...

1558
01:52:40,286 --> 01:52:43,847
then we wouldn't be in this most
perfect and huge hotel room...

1559
01:52:43,923 --> 01:52:45,857
with a truckload
of all this free stuff...

1560
01:52:45,892 --> 01:52:47,519
so...

1561
01:52:47,560 --> 01:52:48,686
I think it only fair...

1562
01:52:48,728 --> 01:52:51,356
that Kevin get to open up
the first present.

1563
01:52:51,998 --> 01:52:53,124
Then I'll go...

1564
01:52:53,166 --> 01:52:54,793
and the rest of you, and so on.

1565
01:52:59,272 --> 01:53:01,900
Merry Christmas, Kev.

1566
01:53:01,941 --> 01:53:03,704
Merry Christmas, Buzz.

1567
01:53:06,379 --> 01:53:07,505
PETER: Merry Christmas, Kevin.

1568
01:53:07,547 --> 01:53:09,242
FRANK: OK, Kevin!

1569
01:53:09,282 --> 01:53:11,512
All right! Merry Christmas!

1570
01:53:13,586 --> 01:53:15,611
Enough of this gooey sh--

1571
01:53:15,688 --> 01:53:17,349
show...of emotion.

1572
01:53:17,423 --> 01:53:18,515
Everyone, let's dig in!

1573
01:53:18,591 --> 01:53:21,754
-All right!
-Everybody, wait.

1574
01:53:21,795 --> 01:53:23,353
LESLlE: Save the paper.
We can use it next year.

1575
01:53:23,396 --> 01:53:25,455
Give me the bows.

1576
01:54:01,034 --> 01:54:02,661
Merry Christmas.

1577
01:54:05,138 --> 01:54:06,571
Kevin!

1578
01:54:06,639 --> 01:54:08,266
Merry Christmas!

1579
01:54:09,275 --> 01:54:10,435
I got something for you.

1580
01:54:18,818 --> 01:54:19,910
What's this?

1581
01:54:19,986 --> 01:54:21,453
It's a turtledove.

1582
01:54:21,487 --> 01:54:23,421
I have one, you have one.

1583
01:54:23,456 --> 01:54:25,356
As long as we each
have a turtledove...

1584
01:54:25,391 --> 01:54:26,915
we'll be friends forever.

1585
01:54:30,964 --> 01:54:33,228
Oh, Kevin.

1586
01:54:36,236 --> 01:54:38,397
Thank you.

1587
01:54:39,639 --> 01:54:41,903
I won't forget you. Trust me.

1588
01:54:50,650 --> 01:54:51,810
WOMAN: Oh.

1589
01:55:10,169 --> 01:55:12,399
Mr. McCallister's
room service bill, sir.

1590
01:55:14,507 --> 01:55:15,701
Merry Christmas, sir.

1591
01:55:17,076 --> 01:55:18,236
Uh, oh.

1592
01:55:22,282 --> 01:55:23,977
Nice family.

1593
01:55:24,017 --> 01:55:25,507
Really.

1594
01:55:34,394 --> 01:55:36,328
