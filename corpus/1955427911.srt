1228
01:21:34,640 --> 01:21:36,233
JB: Well, that's it, folks.

1229
01:21:36,308 --> 01:21:39,357
We are making history today

1230
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:43,737
as Jed Perfectus is a few miles
from the finish line!

1231
01:21:44,274 --> 01:21:46,777
Some will say Jed got a lucky break

1232
01:21:46,860 --> 01:21:48,862
when his main rival was attacked by an army

1233
01:21:48,987 --> 01:21:50,989
of bloodthirsty revolutionaries.

1234
01:21:51,073 --> 01:21:53,075
Well, I say tough titties.

1235
01:21:53,158 --> 01:21:55,411
It's out with the old and in with the new,

1236
01:21:55,494 --> 01:21:58,498
as America welcomes its newest,

1237
01:21:58,622 --> 01:22:01,592
and least likely to procreate, champion!

1238
01:22:02,000 --> 01:22:05,095
- I'm gonna win! Holy Jesus.

Will you look at that, Eve!

1240
01:22:07,172 --> 01:22:08,924
Are you gonna score them?

1241
01:22:09,007 --> 01:22:11,556
Shut up! Let me enjoy this!

1242
01:22:11,635 --> 01:22:16,232
I don't know, Jed, it could be
another case of premature celebration.

1243
01:22:16,515 --> 01:22:18,938
No, no, no, no, no!

1244
01:22:19,017 --> 01:22:22,442
Frankenstein is doomed!
I know that for a fact!

1245
01:22:26,692 --> 01:22:27,944
ANNIE: What are you doing?

1246
01:22:28,026 --> 01:22:32,202
Neither of us knows what's
waiting over that finishing line.

1247
01:22:32,281 --> 01:22:36,536
Well, it's definitely a violent death,
but we're not stopping now.

1248
01:22:36,702 --> 01:22:42,459
This race is fixed
and so was your Resistance.

1249
01:22:42,541 --> 01:22:44,635
I don't want to see you get hurt, Annie.

1250
01:22:44,710 --> 01:22:46,383
So, you think we can just drive away?

1251
01:22:46,462 --> 01:22:50,307
There's an island off the coast
that's made of garbage,

1252
01:22:50,382 --> 01:22:52,134
it's called Garbantis.

1253
01:22:52,217 --> 01:22:53,639
I can't do that.

1254
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:55,642
Can you give me a reason why not?

1255
01:22:59,057 --> 01:23:01,685
Because I can't imagine spending
the rest of my life

1256
01:23:01,768 --> 01:23:05,568
with a man who finished
second to Jed Perfectus.

1257
01:23:10,027 --> 01:23:13,952
And besides, the winner
gets to meet The Chairman.

1258
01:23:14,031 --> 01:23:17,126
Oh! Yes, oh, God, that is disgusting.

1259
01:23:17,576 --> 01:23:20,750
You are awful, awful, awful ugly people.

1260

Oh, what the shit!

1261
01:23:24,458 --> 01:23:28,178
Holy moly, mack-a-roly, race fans! Can it be?

1262
01:23:28,253 --> 01:23:31,257
Another miraculous recovery for Frankenstein?

1263
01:23:33,091 --> 01:23:34,684
Why won't you die?

1264
01:23:34,927 --> 01:23:36,349

Not really.

1278
01:24:33,110 --> 01:24:35,784
Isn't he headed straight for the studio?

1279
01:24:35,988 --> 01:24:40,038
Well, it looks like 60 points
for Jed and we are signing off.

You are so dead.

1285
01:25:10,022 --> 01:25:11,820
The truth is,

1286
01:25:11,898 --> 01:25:17,371
I've lost track of my score,
my time, my position.

1287
01:25:17,446 --> 01:25:20,245
Maybe Jed is winning the race,
even though he's dead.

1288
01:25:21,158 --> 01:25:23,536
Now, we could run down
those people over there,

1289
01:25:23,619 --> 01:25:25,292
that would be 50 points.

1290
01:25:25,370 --> 01:25:27,623
Or how about those people over there?

1291
01:25:27,706 --> 01:25:29,629
That would be another 50 points.

1292
01:25:29,708 --> 01:25:35,306
But what about that man over there?

1293
01:25:36,465 --> 01:25:41,346
He must be worth at least 1,000 points.
