1
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,982
Mom, you be careful.

2
00:02:29,191 --> 00:02:31,235
ALPENA, MICHIGAN 1984

3
00:02:32,319 --> 00:02:35,739
I think this is longer than it used to be!
What a lovely day.

4
00:02:35,948 --> 00:02:38,617
BASED ON A TRUE STORY

5
00:02:38,825 --> 00:02:43,247
- Dad is looking so well.
- He is, isn't he? He always was a fighter.

6
00:02:44,998 --> 00:02:49,628
- Look at Mahtob.
- She's such a daddy's girl.

7
00:02:49,837 --> 00:02:51,964
Well, so were you.

8
00:02:53,215 --> 00:02:57,511
Moody, Mahtob, Dad!
Come on. Fresh, home-made lemonade.

9
00:02:57,719 --> 00:02:59,763
Come on, everybody.

10
00:02:59,972 --> 00:03:03,851
Mom, Daddy's teaching me
how to fish again.

11
00:03:08,355 --> 00:03:13,068
- Can I see today's catch?
- One of these days, oh ye of little faith.

12
00:03:14,236 --> 00:03:17,406
- Here you go. Dad, d'you want lemonade?
- Yes.

13
00:03:17,614 --> 00:03:18,949
OK.

14
00:03:19,157 --> 00:03:21,076
- Ah.
- Sour?

15
00:03:21,285 --> 00:03:25,831
- A little.
- Not enough sugar? I never get that right.

16
00:03:26,039 --> 00:03:31,170
Hey, Mahtob.
What vitamins do we get from lemons?

17
00:03:31,378 --> 00:03:34,798
- What vitamins do we get from lemons?
- Vitamin C.

18
00:03:35,007 --> 00:03:37,426
Yes. What vitamins
do we get from bananas?

19
00:03:37,634 --> 00:03:41,305
- Vitamin C, vitamin B and fibre.
- Right!

20
00:03:43,599 --> 00:03:47,728
- None of my kids was as smart as that.
- Great. Thanks, Mom

21
00:03:47,936 --> 00:03:50,439
- And what are you gonna be?
- A nurse.

22
00:03:50,647 --> 00:03:53,817
- You can be a doctor as well.
- A doctor and a nurse.

23
00:03:54,026 --> 00:03:57,613
How do you teach Mahtob to fish
when you've never caught one?

24
00:03:57,821 --> 00:04:01,700
Honey, it's the best way.
This way I'm totally unprejudiced.

25
00:04:01,909 --> 00:04:06,455
He bought all this fishing equipment
and he's had her out there every day.

26
00:04:06,663 --> 00:04:11,210
If it's a choice between your lemonade
and my fishing, I know where I stand.

27
00:04:11,418 --> 00:04:15,339
- I wanna sit on Daddy's lap.
- Well, it's my turn.

28
00:04:15,547 --> 00:04:18,967
- Don't fight over me, girls.
- You should find another lap.

29
00:04:24,765 --> 00:04:27,267
And then we have... Thank you.

30
00:04:27,476 --> 00:04:32,689
.. a 30-year-old woman with a Class 3
Pap smear for a TAH, so I think...

31
00:04:32,898 --> 00:04:36,693
The Iranians have prayed themselves
back into the Stone Age.

32
00:04:36,902 --> 00:04:40,197
Why would anybody come to the States
to study medicine?

33
00:04:40,405 --> 00:04:42,783
You can get a degree in Iran in two weeks.

34
00:04:42,991 --> 00:04:44,493
Seven days.

35
00:04:44,701 --> 00:04:48,830
The Ayatollah's got some great ideas.
A soldier gets wounded, let him die.

36
00:04:49,039 --> 00:04:50,958
He's gonna go to paradise anyway.

37
00:04:51,166 --> 00:04:54,711
- See that newspaper?
- The Iranian funny page?

38
00:04:54,920 --> 00:04:59,800
How can he read that thing?
Looks like one of my prescriptions!

39
00:05:00,008 --> 00:05:02,052
I've read that prescription.

40
00:05:37,838 --> 00:05:40,465
- No, no, don't turn it off.
- It's OK.

41
00:05:43,510 --> 00:05:46,847
- Honey, what's wrong?
- Nothing's wrong. I'm fine.

42
00:05:51,185 --> 00:05:54,938
What's wrong?
The family - is everything all right?

43
00:05:55,147 --> 00:05:57,191
Everybody's fine. They're fine.

44
00:05:58,275 --> 00:06:02,654
By the way, Mammal phoned.
He and Nasserine have had a baby boy.

45
00:06:03,739 --> 00:06:06,283
That's great.

46
00:06:09,620 --> 00:06:12,247
A couple of doctors
were making cracks again.

47
00:06:13,749 --> 00:06:16,210
- Who were they?
- What does it matter?

48
00:06:16,418 --> 00:06:19,463
It matters, Moody. It matters.

49
00:06:19,671 --> 00:06:22,424
We moved here to get away from all that.

50
00:06:22,633 --> 00:06:26,220
- God, it's just so awful!
- Oh, honey, forget it.

51
00:06:27,638 --> 00:06:32,643
Honey, forget it.
There are dumb people everywhere.

52
00:06:34,603 --> 00:06:36,605
Forget it.

53
00:06:36,813 --> 00:06:39,566
"And the genie roared with laughter.
Ha ha ha!"

54
00:06:39,775 --> 00:06:42,361
"O thou poor thief
of a thousand alleyways. "

55
00:06:42,569 --> 00:06:45,239
"You think you can marry
the Sultan's daughter

56
00:06:45,447 --> 00:06:48,992
when all the princes in Persia
are seeking her hand?"

57
00:06:49,201 --> 00:06:52,246
"You foolish slave,
replied Aladdin boldly. "

58
00:06:52,454 --> 00:06:55,582
"Have you forgotten
the precious jewels in the cave?"

59
00:06:55,791 --> 00:06:58,085
"You have the wits of a donkey. "

60
00:06:58,293 --> 00:07:01,588
"I should put you back
into the dirty old lamp. "

61
00:07:01,797 --> 00:07:05,133
- Is there really Aladdin's cave?
- There must be.

62
00:07:05,342 --> 00:07:09,471
- Can we find it?
- I'm not sure if I know where it is, but...

63
00:07:09,680 --> 00:07:13,684
You know, I was born in Persia.
They call it Iran now.

64
00:07:13,892 --> 00:07:18,397
If I took you there,
maybe we could look for it together.

65
00:07:18,605 --> 00:07:24,528
Iran's got caves and mountains
and deserts, just like in the story.

66
00:07:24,736 --> 00:07:28,991
And mosques
that are so beautiful they're like jewels.

67
00:07:29,199 --> 00:07:33,120
When the sun shines on them
they dazzle your eyes.

68
00:07:33,328 --> 00:07:35,372
Would you like to see those?

69
00:07:36,748 --> 00:07:38,792
OK. Where were we?

70
00:07:40,419 --> 00:07:42,462
- Daddy?
- Uh-huh?

71
00:07:42,671 --> 00:07:45,215
Do I hate Americans?

72
00:07:46,300 --> 00:07:48,093
Of course not.

73
00:07:48,302 --> 00:07:52,306
Lucille says I hate Americans
because you're from Iran.

74
00:08:00,939 --> 00:08:06,653
Sweetheart... Lucille doesn't really know
what she's talking about.

75
00:08:08,113 --> 00:08:11,950
So we shouldn't pay
too much attention to her.

76
00:08:12,159 --> 00:08:14,995
I've lived in America for 20 years.

77
00:08:15,204 --> 00:08:17,956
I'm as American as apple pie.

78
00:08:19,041 --> 00:08:23,128
And so are you. Give me a kiss.

79
00:08:24,796 --> 00:08:26,840
Big hugs.

80
00:08:27,966 --> 00:08:30,093
Mmm. Big hugs.

81
00:09:05,587 --> 00:09:09,758
That was Ameh Bozorg.
It's always the same.

82
00:09:11,885 --> 00:09:14,429
She cries and cries on the phone.

83
00:09:15,514 --> 00:09:20,018
"You're like a son to me.
When your mother died, I raised you. "

84
00:09:20,227 --> 00:09:22,813
"I'm sick.
You're not here to look after me. "

85
00:09:23,021 --> 00:09:25,482
- Is she sick?
- No, no, she's not sick.

86
00:09:26,692 --> 00:09:30,487
She's 58. She feels old, but she's not sick.

87
00:09:30,696 --> 00:09:34,074
- Same old guilt trip.
- Oh, honey, come on.

88
00:09:34,283 --> 00:09:37,160
She's your sister. Phone her more often.

89
00:09:37,369 --> 00:09:40,080
Phoning's no good. She wants to see me.

90
00:09:40,289 --> 00:09:44,710
Now Mammal and Nasserine have had
the baby, everybody's there except me.

91
00:09:44,918 --> 00:09:48,630
It's been ten years.
I haven't seen my family for ten years.

92
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:52,509
Mammal and Reza have been here.
Why doesn't she come?

93
00:09:52,718 --> 00:09:56,555
She's hardly been out of Tehran.
She wants to see me over there.

94
00:09:56,763 --> 00:10:01,727
They want to see us.
They've never met you or Mahtob.

95
00:10:01,935 --> 00:10:06,148
- She asks why we can't go for a vacation.
- You'll have to explain it to them.

96
00:10:06,356 --> 00:10:10,485
- Explain what?
- We can't go to Iran.

97
00:10:10,694 --> 00:10:12,696
Why not?

98
00:10:12,905 --> 00:10:16,200
I'm not taking Mahtob to Iran.
It's much too violent.

99
00:10:16,408 --> 00:10:19,536
We're not going to go sightseeing
to the Persian Gulf.

100
00:10:19,745 --> 00:10:22,915
We're going to spend two weeks
with my family.

101
00:10:23,123 --> 00:10:25,709
Moody, there's too much
going on over there.

102
00:10:25,918 --> 00:10:30,047
Look, your family is welcome here
any time. You know that.

103
00:10:31,173 --> 00:10:34,218
Maybe you should just go there yourself.

104
00:10:34,426 --> 00:10:38,138
No. I don't mean that either.
None of us should go. It's not safe.

105
00:10:38,347 --> 00:10:40,682
- Mommy!
- I'm coming!

106
00:10:40,891 --> 00:10:43,018
You're getting it out of proportion.

107
00:10:43,227 --> 00:10:46,897
I haven't seen any of them for ten years.

108
00:10:47,105 --> 00:10:48,524
- Honey, I...
- Mommy!

109
00:10:48,732 --> 00:10:51,318
All right! I'm coming!

110
00:10:53,862 --> 00:10:55,906
No, it's OK. Go ahead.

111
00:11:29,940 --> 00:11:32,484
Honey, I want to go more than anything.

112
00:11:32,693 --> 00:11:35,529
I miss them so much.

113
00:11:35,737 --> 00:11:38,824
You're always talking
about how important family is.

114
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:44,371
All I want to do is go for two weeks
with you and Mahtob and visit my family.

115
00:11:44,580 --> 00:11:48,250
- Moody, it scares me.
- What scares you, honey?

116
00:11:49,334 --> 00:11:51,920
Look at me.

117
00:11:52,129 --> 00:11:57,676
Do you honestly think that I would take
you and Mahtob anywhere dangerous?

118
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:02,306
I love you both
more than anything in the whole world.

119
00:12:02,514 --> 00:12:06,059
Listen. Mahtob's got a vacation.

120
00:12:06,268 --> 00:12:09,813
She starts a new school. It's a good time.

121
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,577
I swear to you...

122
00:12:24,912 --> 00:12:27,122
on the sacred Koran

123
00:12:27,331 --> 00:12:33,378
that you won't be in any danger,
that we'll be back after two weeks

124
00:12:33,587 --> 00:12:38,759
and that I wouldn't do anything
to jeopardise yours or Mahtob's safety.

125
00:12:41,512 --> 00:12:45,516
Come on, honey.
It's not such a big deal.

126
00:13:47,744 --> 00:13:50,747
Look what they're doing.

127
00:14:01,633 --> 00:14:04,178
- Hello, Betty.
- Hello, Nasserine.

128
00:14:04,386 --> 00:14:06,513
It's so good to see you.

129
00:14:10,601 --> 00:14:13,020
This is Mahtob.

130
00:14:13,228 --> 00:14:17,900
- Betty! Betty! This is Ameh Bozorg!
- Sweetheart, that's Daddy's sister.

131
00:14:20,819 --> 00:14:24,865
- Oh, my goodness. Look. Mahtob.
- Mahtob!

132
00:14:26,158 --> 00:14:28,702
Moonlight. You are moonlight.

133
00:14:28,911 --> 00:14:32,164
I know. Mahtob means "moonlight".

134
00:14:32,372 --> 00:14:34,166
Mahtob.

135
00:14:34,374 --> 00:14:38,253
Betty? I'm so happy.
Now you can be with us.

136
00:14:38,462 --> 00:14:41,673
Yes. It's only for two weeks
but I'm very pleased.

137
00:14:41,882 --> 00:14:44,426
I remember your house
in America very well.

138
00:14:44,635 --> 00:14:48,430
- Mammal, it's so good to see you.
- Finally you're here, Betty.

139
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:53,018
Yes. I'm so glad we could come for a visit.
Congratulations on the baby.

140
00:14:53,227 --> 00:14:54,561
Thank you.

141
00:14:56,939 --> 00:14:58,690
- What?
- Nothing.

142
00:14:58,899 --> 00:15:05,656
She says Mahtob looks almost exact
to Moody and to Ameh Bozorg.

143
00:15:17,835 --> 00:15:21,797
- Some reception, huh?
- Oh, my gosh. It's amazing.

144
00:15:22,005 --> 00:15:25,342
- You know all these people?
- All of them.

145
00:15:26,510 --> 00:15:28,554
Oh, boy. This is all my family.

146
00:15:28,762 --> 00:15:32,891
- Obviously they really missed you.
- The car's just over here.

147
00:15:41,900 --> 00:15:43,944
Go ahead. Unwrap it. It's a gift.

148
00:15:46,154 --> 00:15:48,574
Thank you. Isn't that nice?

149
00:15:51,910 --> 00:15:54,663
Oh, thank you. Thank you.

150
00:15:54,872 --> 00:15:57,124
- Go on, put it on.
- Now?

151
00:15:57,332 --> 00:16:01,461
Yeah. It's, er... They've gone
to a lot of trouble. It'll make them happy.

152
00:16:01,670 --> 00:16:04,214
- All right.
- It's pretty good quality.

153
00:16:06,049 --> 00:16:08,093
Let's get in the car.

154
00:16:58,727 --> 00:17:01,730
God... it all looks so different.

155
00:17:05,734 --> 00:17:09,321
You said foreign women
don't have to wear Islamic dress.

156
00:17:09,530 --> 00:17:12,449
Yeah, I know. I made a mistake.

157
00:17:13,534 --> 00:17:15,953
It's all changed.

158
00:17:16,161 --> 00:17:20,457
Anyway, it's only when you leave
the house or when you go outside.

159
00:17:20,666 --> 00:17:25,295
You saw the women. I didn't recognise
half my family. They were all covered.

160
00:17:25,504 --> 00:17:31,009
Last time only half of them wore chadors.
It's all new.

161
00:17:31,218 --> 00:17:34,513
- What would happen if I didn't wear this?
- Ameh Bozorg?

162
00:17:44,314 --> 00:17:46,358
She says you'd get arrested.

163
00:17:58,704 --> 00:18:02,291
- I have to go to the bathroom.
- Wait. We're almost there.

164
00:18:15,095 --> 00:18:16,763
Hi.

165
00:18:22,311 --> 00:18:26,064
No! They're hurting him, Mommy!
They're hurting him!

166
00:18:26,273 --> 00:18:28,442
They're hurting him, Mommy!

167
00:18:28,650 --> 00:18:32,529
It's a way of saying welcome.
They give the meat to the poor.

168
00:18:32,738 --> 00:18:36,116
Honey, we have to step over it.
It's expected.

169
00:18:36,325 --> 00:18:38,785
Just hang on to me.

170
00:18:52,591 --> 00:18:54,384
Mahtob...

171
00:19:14,238 --> 00:19:19,201
It's the Friday prayer.
From Tehran University.

172
00:19:50,107 --> 00:19:52,067
Mahmood...

173
00:20:01,285 --> 00:20:03,328
Prayers.

174
00:21:09,728 --> 00:21:14,566
Don't forget we've got
to get some things for your mom and dad.

175
00:21:16,360 --> 00:21:19,238
Thank you, honey. Let me do you.

176
00:21:23,867 --> 00:21:25,369
All right?

177
00:21:33,085 --> 00:21:37,130
<i>Fix your scarf!
Fix your hair! Cover your hair!</i>

178
00:21:58,944 --> 00:22:02,865
They didn't know you were foreign.
They wouldn't have been so harsh.

179
00:22:03,073 --> 00:22:07,619
- It was a little bit of hair.
- You gotta be careful. They're very strict.

180
00:22:08,704 --> 00:22:11,248
You must cover all.
You must not be careless!

181
00:22:11,456 --> 00:22:17,045
Every hair that is not covered is like a
dagger aimed at the heart of our martyrs!

182
00:22:17,254 --> 00:22:19,298
Come on.

183
00:22:19,506 --> 00:22:22,384
Just give it time, sweetheart. It's OK.

184
00:22:38,567 --> 00:22:40,611
Look at these hands.

185
00:22:47,034 --> 00:22:49,203
Sshh!

186
00:23:01,381 --> 00:23:03,759
- Mom...
- Sshh!

187
00:23:14,353 --> 00:23:17,439
I guess that means we can eat.

188
00:23:39,002 --> 00:23:41,839
Come on, sit up straight.

189
00:23:54,059 --> 00:23:56,436
Is it because I didn't wear a chador?

190
00:23:56,645 --> 00:24:00,190
Honey, you misinterpreted.
She wasn't looking at you.

191
00:24:00,399 --> 00:24:03,527
You didn't see. She looked at me...

192
00:24:03,735 --> 00:24:07,322
It was the same feeling today
when the police stopped me.

193
00:24:07,531 --> 00:24:10,117
It was with such dislike.

194
00:24:11,910 --> 00:24:15,414
It just seems so primitive sometimes.

195
00:24:15,622 --> 00:24:19,710
All religious beliefs seem primitive
when they're not your own.

196
00:24:19,918 --> 00:24:22,546
But to cover them up
and hide them away?

197
00:24:22,754 --> 00:24:26,758
- Are they afraid of women's sexuality?
- No, that's not the reason.

198
00:24:26,967 --> 00:24:30,429
Iranian women like to wear the chador.
It's a mark of respect.

199
00:24:30,637 --> 00:24:34,683
When the Shah tried to ban them
they had demonstrations in the streets.

200
00:24:34,892 --> 00:24:37,769
Most women wanted to bring it back.

201
00:24:41,148 --> 00:24:46,820
Sorry. I know it's a different culture.
I guess I... just don't understand it.

202
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,035
Why is Mammal angry at you,
and the others?

203
00:24:53,243 --> 00:24:56,538
They seem to be going at you all the time.

204
00:24:57,623 --> 00:25:00,792
My family... they're very religious.

205
00:25:01,001 --> 00:25:04,963
They're not sophisticated.
They're basically country people.

206
00:25:06,256 --> 00:25:09,051
It's all changed so much.

207
00:25:09,259 --> 00:25:13,138
It's all back to the Koran.
It's been that way since the Revolution.

208
00:25:13,347 --> 00:25:15,432
When they moved into this house,

209
00:25:15,641 --> 00:25:18,727
they got rid of all the furniture -
all of it.

210
00:25:19,770 --> 00:25:25,067
Now they see me and...
I seem so Americanised.

211
00:25:25,275 --> 00:25:27,778
And you have an American wife.

212
00:25:30,405 --> 00:25:32,825
- Yeah.
- I'm sorry.

213
00:25:33,033 --> 00:25:35,786
The last thing I wanted
was to insult them...

214
00:25:35,994 --> 00:25:37,329
I know.

215
00:25:42,626 --> 00:25:46,004
Honey, it's going
to seem strange for a while,

216
00:25:46,213 --> 00:25:49,424
but, believe me, they want to love you.

217
00:25:49,633 --> 00:25:52,886
They will. I promise.

218
00:25:53,095 --> 00:25:54,596
OK.

219
00:25:57,975 --> 00:25:59,810
- What?
- Nothing.

220
00:26:00,018 --> 00:26:02,896
- Nothing.
- What's so funny?

221
00:26:03,105 --> 00:26:06,233
You know they think
we make love all the time?

222
00:26:07,693 --> 00:26:09,528
- Who?
- The family.

223
00:26:09,736 --> 00:26:11,780
Why?

224
00:26:11,989 --> 00:26:15,367
After they make love
they have to take a shower.

225
00:26:15,576 --> 00:26:19,371
They can't pray unless they do.
It's considered unclean.

226
00:26:19,580 --> 00:26:23,041
We're taking two or three showers a day!

227
00:26:23,250 --> 00:26:26,170
Oh, God! What, they think
we're two rabbits?

228
00:26:28,630 --> 00:26:31,842
I'm not taking another shower.
You knew the whole time!

229
00:26:32,050 --> 00:26:36,597
- I didn't know you were such a swinger!
- You knew that all along!

230
00:26:36,805 --> 00:26:40,434
- You were out in the hall giggling!
- Don't get mad.

231
00:27:29,191 --> 00:27:31,860
- Don't go.
- I have to.

232
00:27:33,111 --> 00:27:36,240
- Please stay.
- I can't.

233
00:27:36,448 --> 00:27:39,868
You've been getting up early
every morning. Don't go.

234
00:27:40,077 --> 00:27:43,080
What's the matter with you?
We're with my family.

235
00:27:43,288 --> 00:27:46,750
They're Sayyeds -
direct descendants of Mohammed.

236
00:27:46,959 --> 00:27:51,171
Of course, to a sophisticated American
that must seem primitive.

237
00:28:42,848 --> 00:28:46,518
- Betty?
- Oh, God, you scared me.

238
00:28:46,727 --> 00:28:48,562
I wondered where you were.

239
00:28:48,770 --> 00:28:54,193
- I got the most beautiful picture.
- Light's gone. Coming in?

240
00:28:54,401 --> 00:28:55,903
Yeah.

241
00:29:08,207 --> 00:29:10,459
- Betty?
- What?

242
00:29:13,712 --> 00:29:16,924
Something happened
before we came out here.

243
00:29:17,132 --> 00:29:18,467
What?

244
00:29:18,675 --> 00:29:22,721
I didn't want to tell you about it.
We were coming out here, so...

245
00:29:22,930 --> 00:29:24,973
Moody, what happened?

246
00:29:32,356 --> 00:29:35,067
I got fired from the hospital.

247
00:29:36,151 --> 00:29:37,986
You got fired?

248
00:29:38,195 --> 00:29:41,448
It happened just before we left.

249
00:29:41,657 --> 00:29:44,034
Literally, two days.

250
00:29:49,248 --> 00:29:52,626
I can't believe it. They can't do that.

251
00:29:52,835 --> 00:29:57,714
Yes, they can. If they can find someone
who can do the job for less money.

252
00:29:57,923 --> 00:30:00,259
Oh, no.

253
00:30:00,467 --> 00:30:03,011
And who isn't an Iranian.

254
00:30:04,137 --> 00:30:07,724
Oh... Moody, I can't believe that.

255
00:30:07,933 --> 00:30:13,105
- Your work was going so well.
- You think they like Iranians in Michigan?

256
00:30:14,064 --> 00:30:19,111
It's always there... just under the surface.

257
00:30:21,947 --> 00:30:25,075
Not one of my colleagues

258
00:30:25,284 --> 00:30:27,786
has ever stood up for me
whenever there was trouble.

259
00:30:27,995 --> 00:30:29,580
Honey, that's not true.

260
00:30:29,788 --> 00:30:33,250
We're talking
about the medical profession.

261
00:30:33,458 --> 00:30:37,337
They're supposed to be
an educated group of people.

262
00:30:37,546 --> 00:30:39,590
What are we gonna do?

263
00:30:42,968 --> 00:30:47,306
Well... I'll tell you what we're gonna do.

264
00:30:47,514 --> 00:30:51,185
We're gonna go home tomorrow
and find out how this happened.

265
00:30:51,393 --> 00:30:54,313
We'll appeal. It's America. We've got laws.

266
00:30:54,521 --> 00:30:57,191
We've got friends.
You've got lots of friends.

267
00:30:57,399 --> 00:30:59,776
And this just can't happen.

268
00:31:02,112 --> 00:31:03,614
Hey!

269
00:31:04,698 --> 00:31:07,618
Stop that. Look at you
messing everything up.

270
00:31:07,826 --> 00:31:09,703
Get your own stuff together.

271
00:31:09,912 --> 00:31:13,999
- I don't think they'll let this through.
- Maybe Mammal can ship it.

272
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:18,587
Do you wanna pack Toby Bunny
or carry him? It's gonna be hot.

273
00:31:18,795 --> 00:31:20,339
- Pack him.
- OK.

274
00:31:20,547 --> 00:31:23,926
Sit down and fold up
all those clothes you messed up.

275
00:31:24,134 --> 00:31:26,929
- Can I put them in the suitcase?
- Yes.

276
00:31:27,137 --> 00:31:30,140
Sweetheart, you haven't packed.
Do you want me to do it?

277
00:31:30,349 --> 00:31:32,267
No.

278
00:31:38,148 --> 00:31:43,445
You must take passport to the airport
three days before to get approval.

279
00:31:43,654 --> 00:31:47,616
- Approval? What approval?
- You must get stamp.

280
00:31:47,825 --> 00:31:50,828
- You cannot leave today.
- When's the next flight?

281
00:31:51,036 --> 00:31:53,080
I don't know.

282
00:31:58,752 --> 00:32:02,172
- Moody, what is this?
- I don't know.

283
00:32:02,381 --> 00:32:05,926
We'll have to wait
for the next available flight, I guess.

284
00:32:10,597 --> 00:32:13,141
How could you not
take care of the passports?

285
00:32:13,350 --> 00:32:18,772
- Didn't somebody tell you about this?
- Nobody thought about it.

286
00:32:18,981 --> 00:32:24,069
We'll go to the airport
and tell them we didn't know about it.

287
00:32:24,278 --> 00:32:28,615
Maybe they'll let us through. If not,
we'll sit and wait for the next flight.

288
00:32:28,824 --> 00:32:31,952
I don't know how to say this to you.

289
00:32:33,203 --> 00:32:36,331
We're not going back. We're staying here.

290
00:32:38,125 --> 00:32:40,210
What do you mean? How long?

291
00:32:40,419 --> 00:32:43,630
I want to get a job here. In a hospital.

292
00:32:44,715 --> 00:32:48,844
- What?
- I want us to live in Iran.

293
00:32:49,928 --> 00:32:52,890
No. No.

294
00:32:53,098 --> 00:32:56,310
- There's nothing for me in America.
- No.

295
00:32:58,187 --> 00:33:02,983
Are you crazy? We're Americans.
Your daughter's an American.

296
00:33:03,192 --> 00:33:05,652
Moody, honey,
you're upset about your job.

297
00:33:05,861 --> 00:33:08,322
I understand that. We're gonna fix it.

298
00:33:08,530 --> 00:33:10,616
- I want Mahtob to grow up here.
- No!

299
00:33:10,824 --> 00:33:14,119
- I think she should become a Muslim.
- No! No.

300
00:33:17,581 --> 00:33:19,625
You lied to me.

301
00:33:20,709 --> 00:33:24,963
You lied to me. You held the Koran
and swore nothing was gonna happen.

302
00:33:25,172 --> 00:33:28,467
- Mommy.
- You were planning this all the time.

303
00:33:28,675 --> 00:33:31,178
- Aren't we going home today?
- Yes, we are.

304
00:33:31,386 --> 00:33:35,516
- Go downstairs and say goodbye.
- All right.

305
00:33:41,146 --> 00:33:43,565
Moody, I know what's been going on.

306
00:33:43,774 --> 00:33:47,110
They've got no right.
You've got to resist it.

307
00:33:55,202 --> 00:33:59,414
I know how much you miss your family,
how guilty they make you feel.

308
00:33:59,623 --> 00:34:02,084
I know the pressure
they're putting on you.

309
00:34:02,292 --> 00:34:06,004
I promise we'll come back.
We'll spend time here.

310
00:34:06,213 --> 00:34:08,590
But we can't stay here.

311
00:34:08,799 --> 00:34:11,718
This is a backward, primitive country.

312
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:15,389
I won't live here
or bring up my daughter here.

313
00:34:15,597 --> 00:34:19,434
How can you consider raising
Mahtob here with how they treat women?

314
00:34:19,643 --> 00:34:22,271
- I know it's the right decision.
- No.

315
00:34:22,479 --> 00:34:25,858
- For all of us. For you and for Mahtob.
- You can't mean this.

316
00:34:26,066 --> 00:34:30,529
I'm a doctor. They're desperate
for doctors. I could do a lot of good here.

317
00:34:30,737 --> 00:34:33,073
- Please...
- Besides, I'm a Muslim.

318
00:34:33,282 --> 00:34:35,534
- This is where I should be.
- Don't do this.

319
00:34:35,742 --> 00:34:39,037
I know it seems harsh,
but it's the best thing for all of us.

320
00:34:39,246 --> 00:34:43,542
- Mahtob could learn real values here.
- No! I won't stay here. You can't...

321
00:34:43,750 --> 00:34:45,836
You listen to me.

322
00:34:46,044 --> 00:34:48,130
You're in my country now.

323
00:34:48,338 --> 00:34:51,717
You're my wife. You do as I say.
You understand me?

324
00:34:53,468 --> 00:34:55,512
We're staying here.

325
00:35:28,837 --> 00:35:32,257
Mammal, would you translate for me?

326
00:35:34,927 --> 00:35:39,389
Please excuse me if I don't get my words
straight. I'm a bit shaken up.

327
00:35:42,893 --> 00:35:47,022
I wanted to talk to you to see
if you could understand my feelings.

328
00:35:51,944 --> 00:35:55,113
Moody and I have been married
for seven years.

329
00:35:55,322 --> 00:35:58,617
We have loved each other very much
and trusted each other.

330
00:35:58,826 --> 00:36:00,953
Trust was always very important.

331
00:36:03,872 --> 00:36:06,083
I didn't want to come here.

332
00:36:06,291 --> 00:36:09,545
Moody knew that.
I made it very clear to him.

333
00:36:09,753 --> 00:36:14,424
The only reason I came was to visit
with you so you could meet our daughter.

334
00:36:17,511 --> 00:36:19,680
But I was frightened.

335
00:36:20,556 --> 00:36:24,768
So Moody swore to me on the holy Koran
that nothing like this could happen.

336
00:36:28,313 --> 00:36:31,859
He held the Koran and he swore to me.

337
00:36:32,067 --> 00:36:34,111
Isn't that true, Moody?

338
00:36:34,319 --> 00:36:37,322
I had to. You wouldn't
have come with me if I hadn't.

339
00:36:40,075 --> 00:36:42,286
Baba Hajji, you're a religious man.

340
00:36:42,494 --> 00:36:45,873
How can Moody swear on the Koran
and then do this to me?

341
00:37:02,139 --> 00:37:04,349
Allah will forgive him.

342
00:37:09,563 --> 00:37:11,607
No! No!

343
00:37:11,815 --> 00:37:14,943
Ameh Bozorg, Ameh Bozorg,
please help me! Please!

344
00:37:25,537 --> 00:37:28,874
No, you can't do this. Damn you!

345
00:37:29,082 --> 00:37:34,713
Damn you! You can't keep me here!
You had this planned all along!

346
00:37:34,922 --> 00:37:37,174
Damn you!

347
00:38:11,667 --> 00:38:14,253
I'll be with you.

348
00:38:16,463 --> 00:38:18,715
I'll help you.

349
00:38:25,138 --> 00:38:27,349
You try to go to sleep.

350
00:38:33,230 --> 00:38:35,774
Where are the cheque-books
and credit cards?

351
00:38:35,983 --> 00:38:40,112
And I'll need the house keys
and the keys to the car.

352
00:38:43,740 --> 00:38:46,410
They're in the small bag, I think.

353
00:38:53,667 --> 00:38:55,002
Moody?

354
00:38:57,588 --> 00:39:01,175
- Talk to me. Please!
- There's nothing more to say.

355
00:39:02,759 --> 00:39:06,096
Oh, Moody, please. Please talk to me.

356
00:39:13,437 --> 00:39:14,771
Mahmood...

357
00:39:32,414 --> 00:39:36,293
<i>I told you to stop calling here.
No, she's not available.</i>

358
00:39:36,502 --> 00:39:40,631
She's also my wife,
which means she wants to do what I want.

359
00:39:41,924 --> 00:39:45,219
You're not helping him by doing this.

360
00:39:45,427 --> 00:39:49,723
Yes, I know and I'm very sorry,
but this isn't gonna help his illness,

361
00:39:49,932 --> 00:39:51,975
so please leave us alone.

362
00:39:52,184 --> 00:39:54,228
No, I will not discuss...

363
00:39:55,312 --> 00:40:00,192
I really don't care about that. The State
Department can do what the hell it likes!

364
00:40:19,336 --> 00:40:22,631
Betty, you've got to eat.

365
00:40:22,840 --> 00:40:26,426
You can't keep this up.
You're gonna make yourself sick.

366
00:40:33,934 --> 00:40:39,147
If I thought you really wanted to stay here,
we could have such a great life.

367
00:40:46,029 --> 00:40:51,952
You know... when I first heard
the Shah was leaving Iran...

368
00:40:52,161 --> 00:40:55,706
it was just after Mahtob was born.

369
00:40:55,914 --> 00:40:59,960
I couldn't believe it. It was just amazing.

370
00:41:00,169 --> 00:41:04,339
They had everyone on the streets.
Millions of people.

371
00:41:06,717 --> 00:41:09,386
I should have been here.

372
00:41:10,429 --> 00:41:13,932
For the first time,
we could say to everyone,

373
00:41:14,141 --> 00:41:19,188
"This is our faith. This is our way of life.
This is who we are. "

374
00:41:20,939 --> 00:41:23,108
And nothing could stop us.

375
00:41:25,611 --> 00:41:28,155
You can't imagine what that was like.

376
00:41:41,543 --> 00:41:45,005
I know things have been hard for you,
but they'll get better.

377
00:41:45,214 --> 00:41:47,257
I promise you.

378
00:42:04,983 --> 00:42:08,695
- Dear Lord, hear our prayer.
- Dear Lord, hear our prayer.

379
00:42:08,904 --> 00:42:11,824
Please help us leave Iran
and get back to America.

380
00:42:12,032 --> 00:42:15,744
Please help us leave Iran
and get back to America.

381
00:42:15,953 --> 00:42:17,955
Please let nothing separate us.

382
00:42:18,163 --> 00:42:20,249
Please let nothing separate us.

383
00:42:20,457 --> 00:42:23,293
And keep us always safe in your care.

384
00:42:23,502 --> 00:42:26,129
And keep us always safe in your care.

385
00:42:26,338 --> 00:42:28,173
- Amen.
- Amen.

386
00:42:41,019 --> 00:42:42,855
<i>- Hello.
- Hello, Betty.</i>

387
00:42:43,063 --> 00:42:46,358
<i>- Mom? Oh, God!
- Don't talk. Just listen.</i>

388
00:42:46,567 --> 00:42:51,238
<i>You are to go to the 'American Interests
section of the Swiss Embassy.</i>

389
00:42:51,446 --> 00:42:54,324
<i>There is no US Embassy
in Tehran any more.</i>

390
00:42:54,533 --> 00:42:57,035
<i>It's on Khiaban Fereshteh Street.</i>

391
00:42:57,244 --> 00:43:01,039
<i>Their number is 625475.</i>

392
00:43:01,248 --> 00:43:03,917
- 625475...
- What are you doing?

393
00:43:04,126 --> 00:43:07,588
It was ringing. I answered it.

394
00:43:07,796 --> 00:43:10,090
Why do you wanna humiliate me?

395
00:43:10,299 --> 00:43:13,177
You don't touch the phone
or leave the house.

396
00:43:13,385 --> 00:43:14,887
- Do you understand?
- Yes!

397
00:43:56,845 --> 00:43:58,639
<i>Swiss Embassy.</i>

398
00:43:58,847 --> 00:44:01,016
American Interests section.

399
00:44:01,225 --> 00:44:03,602
<i>I can't hear. You'll have to talk louder.</i>

400
00:44:03,810 --> 00:44:07,189
<i>- I can't talk louder.
- I can't hear you, caller.</i>

401
00:44:08,273 --> 00:44:10,317
<i>'Are you there, caller?.</i>

402
00:44:11,693 --> 00:44:14,112
<i>'Are you there, caller?.</i>

403
00:44:14,321 --> 00:44:17,741
Please help me. I'm being held hostage.

404
00:44:17,950 --> 00:44:21,537
<i>You'll have to talk louder.
You're very faint.</i>

405
00:44:21,745 --> 00:44:24,998
I'm being held hostage. Please help me.

406
00:44:25,207 --> 00:44:27,960
<i>I'm sorry. I can't hear you, caller.</i>

407
00:44:34,883 --> 00:44:36,635
Who were you talking to?

408
00:44:36,844 --> 00:44:38,178
- When?
- On the phone.

409
00:44:38,387 --> 00:44:40,722
- No one.
- Don't lie to me!

410
00:44:40,931 --> 00:44:44,142
- Stop it, Daddy!
- It's OK. It's between Mommy and me.

411
00:44:44,351 --> 00:44:48,272
It was nothing. I tried to call Nasserine.
I got the wrong number.

412
00:44:48,480 --> 00:44:52,192
What do you think?
You think you can lie to me?

413
00:44:52,401 --> 00:44:56,113
You think you can do anything
without me knowing about it?

414
00:44:56,321 --> 00:44:58,115
My family tell me everything.

415
00:44:58,323 --> 00:45:01,618
They're watching you all the time,
so don't be stupid.

416
00:45:01,827 --> 00:45:03,996
Mommy isn't stupid.

417
00:45:09,793 --> 00:45:14,548
She's gonna have to start school soon.
We'll have to get her the right clothes.

418
00:45:14,756 --> 00:45:17,968
- I don't wanna go to school.
- What school? When?

419
00:45:34,401 --> 00:45:37,779
American Interests... The Swiss Embassy.

420
00:45:37,988 --> 00:45:42,117
Khiaban Fereshteh is the name
of the street. Khiaban Fereshteh.

421
00:46:06,391 --> 00:46:08,435
<i>Swiss Embassy.</i>

422
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:14,107
My name is Betty Mahmoody.
I'm an American citizen.

423
00:46:14,316 --> 00:46:16,151
<i>Show your passport inside.</i>

424
00:46:28,705 --> 00:46:30,833
- Thank you.
- Passport.

425
00:46:31,041 --> 00:46:35,420
We don't have our passports. My husband
has them. We're American citizens.

426
00:46:37,881 --> 00:46:40,801
- You can go.
- Mommy, we can go home!

427
00:46:51,395 --> 00:46:53,313
My name is Nicole Adjanian.

428
00:46:53,522 --> 00:46:56,191
Betty Mahmoody.
This is my daughter, Mahtob.

429
00:46:56,400 --> 00:46:58,068
- Please sit.
- Thank you.

430
00:46:59,444 --> 00:47:01,572
We're so glad to see you.

431
00:47:03,240 --> 00:47:05,784
I spoke with my mother
in the United States.

432
00:47:05,993 --> 00:47:08,662
I know the State Department is into this.

433
00:47:08,871 --> 00:47:12,124
We're just very happy to be here.
We'll sleep anywhere.

434
00:47:12,332 --> 00:47:15,460
For as long as it takes,
until you can get us out.

435
00:47:15,669 --> 00:47:19,298
What are you talking about?
You cannot stay here.

436
00:47:21,049 --> 00:47:25,387
I can't go back to my husband.
I wanna go home to the United States.

437
00:47:25,596 --> 00:47:27,931
That may be, but you are in Iran.

438
00:47:29,183 --> 00:47:32,603
- You are married to an Iranian?
- Yes.

439
00:47:32,811 --> 00:47:34,980
- Then you are an Iranian citizen.
- No.

440
00:47:35,189 --> 00:47:39,443
I'm not. I'm an American citizen
and my daughter's an American citizen.

441
00:47:39,651 --> 00:47:43,489
We were born in the United States.
We have American passports.

442
00:47:43,697 --> 00:47:47,409
I mean, we don't have them with us.
My husband has them.

443
00:47:47,618 --> 00:47:50,704
We've never changed our citizenship.

444
00:47:52,331 --> 00:47:56,793
If you marry an Iranian man, you
automatically become an Iranian citizen.

445
00:47:57,002 --> 00:47:59,796
The laws regarding women are very strict.

446
00:48:00,005 --> 00:48:03,509
You cannot travel anywhere
without written permission.

447
00:48:03,717 --> 00:48:07,930
You have no rights to the children.
They go to the man in a divorce.

448
00:48:09,932 --> 00:48:12,684
I'm sorry,
but you have to go back to your husband.

449
00:48:12,893 --> 00:48:15,646
But we'll never get out of Iran.

450
00:48:15,854 --> 00:48:19,650
We're being held hostage.
It was almost impossible to come here.

451
00:48:19,858 --> 00:48:24,696
Mrs Mahmoody, there are many American
women here in similar circumstances.

452
00:48:28,075 --> 00:48:30,953
May I ask you why you came to Iran?

453
00:48:36,792 --> 00:48:38,836
I don't know.

454
00:48:40,546 --> 00:48:42,589
I don't know.

455
00:48:44,174 --> 00:48:46,301
I was afraid to come.

456
00:48:49,763 --> 00:48:52,140
I wanted to please him.

457
00:48:52,349 --> 00:48:54,893
I trusted him.

458
00:48:55,102 --> 00:48:58,772
I was frightened
but I never thought this would happen.

459
00:48:58,981 --> 00:49:01,692
I thought of him as an American.

460
00:49:04,069 --> 00:49:07,573
He's changed. Oh, God, he's changed.

461
00:49:09,074 --> 00:49:10,951
Look, Mrs Mahmoody...

462
00:49:12,327 --> 00:49:17,833
Many came back after the Revolution
feeling guilty about being away,

463
00:49:18,041 --> 00:49:21,920
about turning their backs
on Iran and on Islam.

464
00:49:23,297 --> 00:49:28,802
Now Iran is an Islamic state and that's
a wonderful thing for many Iranians.

465
00:49:32,848 --> 00:49:35,851
Well, if there is anything I can do...

466
00:49:36,059 --> 00:49:41,106
Maybe if you need to organise
telephone calls to the US

467
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:44,693
or if you want to write letters home,
let me know.

468
00:49:59,500 --> 00:50:03,170
So if Daddy asks,
we went for a walk and got lost.

469
00:50:11,470 --> 00:50:13,639
Mommy! Mommy! Mommy!

470
00:50:13,847 --> 00:50:16,016
- Where were you?
- I went for a walk!

471
00:50:16,225 --> 00:50:19,478
- Huh? Where were you?
- We went for a walk!

472
00:50:19,686 --> 00:50:21,021
Shut up!

473
00:50:22,815 --> 00:50:27,236
You try anything like this again,
I'll kill you.

474
00:50:33,659 --> 00:50:35,702
Oh, my God.

475
00:50:57,933 --> 00:51:01,562
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

476
00:51:01,770 --> 00:51:04,690
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

477
00:51:04,898 --> 00:51:09,236
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mahtob</i>

478
00:51:09,444 --> 00:51:12,656
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

00:51:14,032 --> 00:51:17,661
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

480
00:51:17,870 --> 00:51:22,291
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

481
00:51:22,499 --> 00:51:26,044
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mahtob</i>

482
00:51:26,253 --> 00:51:30,090
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

483
00:51:46,315 --> 00:51:47,816
Hi.

484
00:51:48,025 --> 00:51:49,359
Hi.

485
00:51:53,280 --> 00:51:55,782
Nasserine said you wanted to see me.

486
00:51:57,034 --> 00:51:59,620
I can't believe she's five, can you?

487
00:52:01,163 --> 00:52:02,498
No.

488
00:52:05,334 --> 00:52:09,838
Thank you for today.
The doll and everything.

489
00:52:14,134 --> 00:52:15,969
I miss her.

490
00:52:22,434 --> 00:52:25,687
Seems I haven't
spent much time with her lately.

491
00:52:28,398 --> 00:52:30,067
Moody...

492
00:52:31,944 --> 00:52:34,613
I wanna make it work.

493
00:52:37,866 --> 00:52:40,786
You were such a wonderful father today.

494
00:52:40,994 --> 00:52:43,997
It brought it all back.

495
00:52:44,206 --> 00:52:47,668
Honey, I want you to be happy.
I want to make you happy.

496
00:52:49,253 --> 00:52:51,797
I need you to help me.

497
00:52:56,218 --> 00:52:57,886
Oh, Betty.

498
00:53:02,641 --> 00:53:04,768
I didn't want it to be like this.

499
00:53:06,353 --> 00:53:10,274
I love you. I never wanna hurt you.

500
00:53:11,358 --> 00:53:16,071
Oh, Moody. Moody, I need you to help me.

501
00:53:19,408 --> 00:53:21,577
We can't stay in this house.

502
00:53:21,785 --> 00:53:25,789
It's my sister's house.
She'd be insulted if we went away.

503
00:53:25,998 --> 00:53:29,251
No. She doesn't want us here.
She doesn't like me.

504
00:53:31,378 --> 00:53:33,213
We got nowhere else to go.

505
00:53:33,422 --> 00:53:35,799
We could stay
with Mammal and Nasserine.

506
00:53:36,008 --> 00:53:38,468
We helped them
when they were in the States.

507
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:42,723
Nasserine goes to classes.
I could babysit. I could help.

508
00:53:42,931 --> 00:53:44,433
Please.

509
00:53:47,269 --> 00:53:48,896
Oh, Betty.

510
00:53:50,189 --> 00:53:52,232
I don't wanna lose you.

511
00:53:56,361 --> 00:53:59,448
I want you to tell me
anything I can ever do.

512
00:54:02,868 --> 00:54:05,078
- The kitchen?
- Kitchen.

513
00:54:07,539 --> 00:54:11,126
I'll cook for you.
I'm so grateful, Nasserine.

514
00:54:17,216 --> 00:54:19,051
Thank you so much.

515
00:54:26,600 --> 00:54:29,394
I was telling them
the same rules apply as before.

516
00:54:50,249 --> 00:54:52,292
You have to wear a chador tonight.

517
00:54:52,501 --> 00:54:53,836
Oh?

518
00:54:54,044 --> 00:54:57,047
My uncle's a mullah.
He's highly respected.

519
00:54:57,256 --> 00:55:01,260
He's a very influential man.
He's written books on Islam.

520
00:55:02,845 --> 00:55:05,931
Maybe he's gonna help me get a job.

521
00:55:10,269 --> 00:55:13,105
Betty, you are very good Iranian cook.

522
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:16,024
- Thank you.
- You are lucky people.

523
00:55:19,361 --> 00:55:21,405
Why you wear chador?

524
00:55:24,825 --> 00:55:27,494
- I thought I had to.
- But why?

525
00:55:27,703 --> 00:55:32,499
Chador is Persian tradition.
It's not necessary to wear it inside.

526
00:55:32,708 --> 00:55:35,377
It is exaggerated with some people now.

527
00:55:37,462 --> 00:55:39,506
Mahmood told me you read Koran.

528
00:55:39,715 --> 00:55:42,426
Yes. I try.

529
00:55:42,634 --> 00:55:44,511
- I like to.
- Very good.

530
00:55:44,720 --> 00:55:48,640
- You go to Koran class?
- No.

531
00:55:50,434 --> 00:55:53,937
Mahmood must send you there.
They are in English language.

532
00:56:01,069 --> 00:56:05,240
- Would you like?
- Yes. Very much.

533
00:56:10,787 --> 00:56:14,541
The Hadiths or reports
are the collected sayings of the Prophet

534
00:56:14,750 --> 00:56:18,003
with additional commentaries
by devout and learned men.

535
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:23,175
In our readings from the Koran, we'll
consider the Hadiths when appropriate.

536
00:56:23,383 --> 00:56:26,094
- What page are we on?
- I don't know. She just...

537
00:56:27,262 --> 00:56:30,766
- You're American.
- Yes.

538
00:56:31,934 --> 00:56:36,355
.. without there being on it an imam
guiding the people to God.

539
00:56:36,563 --> 00:56:39,149
- We lived there!
- You're kidding?

540
00:56:39,358 --> 00:56:41,652
- Chicago.
- But I lived in Michigan.

541
00:56:41,860 --> 00:56:43,237
- Where?
- Near Lancing.

542
00:56:43,445 --> 00:56:46,198
- Where?
- It's a little place. Owosso.

543
00:56:46,406 --> 00:56:50,786
I lived there for five years!
I went to grammar school there.

544
00:56:50,994 --> 00:56:54,915
- My husband had his own practice there.
- My husband's a doctor too.

545
00:56:55,123 --> 00:56:57,376
I can't believe this!

546
00:56:58,377 --> 00:57:03,924
Now I work for an English language
magazine for Islamic women.

547
00:57:04,132 --> 00:57:06,677
- Have you become Muslim?
- Mm-hm.

548
00:57:08,136 --> 00:57:13,016
- Did you convert?
- Well, I wanted to, I guess.

549
00:57:13,225 --> 00:57:17,729
My husband was happy I did.
It made things a lot better.

550
00:57:20,023 --> 00:57:21,859
Er... I gotta go.

551
00:57:22,067 --> 00:57:24,111
- Ellen, it's been...
- No, really.

552
00:57:33,245 --> 00:57:34,872
Moody.

553
00:57:35,080 --> 00:57:40,127
I just met an American woman in class.
From Owosso. Her husband's a doctor.

554
00:57:40,335 --> 00:57:42,421
- Are they here?
- They just left.

555
00:57:42,629 --> 00:57:45,007
She's invited us over. Is that all right?

556
00:57:45,215 --> 00:57:47,259
Yeah, that's fine.

557
00:57:48,844 --> 00:57:52,890
I want you to ask questions
when you're out with your daddy.

558
00:57:53,098 --> 00:57:56,977
I want you to ask him questions
about taxis and buses.

559
00:57:57,186 --> 00:57:59,688
- And how much things cost.
- OK.

560
00:57:59,897 --> 00:58:06,361
All right? Ask him questions about signs.
What the signs mean, what they say.

561
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:08,697
- All right.
- Then you can teach me.

562
00:58:08,906 --> 00:58:11,617
Why do you wanna learn all that?

563
00:58:11,825 --> 00:58:14,161
I have to if we're gonna get out of here.

564
00:58:16,163 --> 00:58:19,124
<i>- What's that?
- His name on the sign.</i>

565
00:58:19,333 --> 00:58:23,670
- What's he sell?
- All kinds of things they sell here.

566
00:58:24,963 --> 00:58:29,384
These are pictures of people
who died in the war.

567
00:58:37,434 --> 00:58:40,270
- Why all these questions, honey?
- What's that?

568
00:58:40,479 --> 00:58:45,025
- That's the rest of the market and...
- What do they do?

569
00:58:57,788 --> 00:59:00,374
Telephone. Telephone.

570
00:59:11,802 --> 00:59:15,180
The moment the Shah left
I wanted to go back to Iran,

571
00:59:15,389 --> 00:59:17,307
but Ellen didn't want to.

572
00:59:17,516 --> 00:59:21,353
So I said, "Fine. I'll go without you. "

573
00:59:21,562 --> 00:59:23,897
So she came.

574
00:59:25,065 --> 00:59:29,111
The first year in Iran
things were very bad between us.

575
00:59:29,319 --> 00:59:32,114
She couldn't adjust. Could you, Ellen?

576
00:59:32,322 --> 00:59:35,909
It took quite a time before she understood
how to be a good wife.

577
00:59:43,917 --> 00:59:45,961
Warm, isn't it?

578
00:59:47,212 --> 00:59:48,714
Yes.

579
00:59:53,677 --> 00:59:55,721
Why did you come back?

580
00:59:56,805 --> 00:59:59,683
I mean, my God,
he let you go home to the States...

581
00:59:59,892 --> 01:00:02,186
and you came back.

582
01:00:02,394 --> 01:00:04,938
Maybe at the beginning if...

583
01:00:05,147 --> 01:00:09,109
Of course there was the custody problem
with the kids, so...

584
01:00:10,611 --> 01:00:12,654
It was tough for me.

585
01:00:12,863 --> 01:00:15,949
I had no experience.
A small American town.

586
01:00:18,702 --> 01:00:22,873
- Was he violent?
- Not in the States, never.

587
01:00:23,081 --> 01:00:25,876
You're not supposed to. It's not Islamic.

588
01:00:28,670 --> 01:00:32,549
Marriages do work out here.
They can be good.

589
01:00:34,092 --> 01:00:39,348
It's been hard for me at times,
but you've got to give it time, Betty.

590
01:00:39,556 --> 01:00:42,392
Islam has such beauty in it.

591
01:00:42,601 --> 01:00:46,063
I mean, I'm glad my kids
are growing up as Muslims.

592
01:00:49,316 --> 01:00:50,901
Ellen...

593
01:00:51,109 --> 01:00:56,156
I'm so happy we're friends. When you told
me you were from home, I was thrilled.

594
01:00:56,365 --> 01:00:58,200
It was like a miracle.

595
01:00:59,284 --> 01:01:00,786
Ellen...

596
01:01:05,165 --> 01:01:08,210
I have something I want to tell you.

597
01:01:08,418 --> 01:01:12,965
If I do, can you keep it a secret?
Not tell your husband?

598
01:01:15,133 --> 01:01:17,261
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

599
01:01:18,554 --> 01:01:21,765
Ellen, I'm sorry. Please forget I spoke.

600
01:01:24,351 --> 01:01:27,521
No, it's OK. Go ahead.

601
01:01:28,605 --> 01:01:32,442
I won't tell him. That's a promise.

602
01:01:32,651 --> 01:01:34,695
Would you take this letter for me?

603
01:01:34,903 --> 01:01:37,322
I'm trying to get back home to America.

604
01:01:37,531 --> 01:01:41,827
My family is working on it, but Moody
knows where I am every minute.

605
01:01:43,871 --> 01:01:48,750
Are you crazy? Don't you realise
what can happen? Terrible things.

606
01:01:48,959 --> 01:01:50,836
You just can't, Betty.

607
01:01:51,044 --> 01:01:53,881
If you were caught,
they could execute you.

608
01:02:02,347 --> 01:02:06,477
It's for the Embassy. Please.

609
01:02:20,657 --> 01:02:22,534
Can you believe that?

610
01:02:22,743 --> 01:02:26,914
They're desperate for doctors,
they've got casualties from the war,

611
01:02:27,122 --> 01:02:30,209
but because I trained in America,
no one will give me a job.

612
01:02:30,417 --> 01:02:32,336
<i>It's not the reason.</i>

613
01:02:35,672 --> 01:02:40,677
Hard to believe this country was getting
sophisticated before the Revolution.

614
01:02:40,886 --> 01:02:44,223
We were building chemical plants,
oil refineries,

615
01:02:44,431 --> 01:02:47,184
multi-million dollar installations.

616
01:02:47,392 --> 01:02:51,980
They're all rotting because nobody knows
how to operate them!

617
01:02:52,189 --> 01:02:54,024
It's all so primitive!

618
01:02:58,862 --> 01:03:03,575
Honey, somebody needs to go to
the market. We're out of meat and things.

619
01:03:03,784 --> 01:03:07,287
- I can't go.
- It's for tonight's dinner.

620
01:03:07,496 --> 01:03:11,750
I can't go. You'll have to wait
till Nasserine gets back.

621
01:03:11,959 --> 01:03:14,044
She's late. What'll we do tonight?

622
01:03:14,253 --> 01:03:17,548
I don't know!
Can't you go by yourself for a change?

623
01:03:18,632 --> 01:03:21,176
Yeah. I can, really.

624
01:03:21,385 --> 01:03:24,888
I know the way. It's not far.
I'll take the children.

625
01:03:33,272 --> 01:03:35,983
You give me a list of everything you need

626
01:03:36,191 --> 01:03:39,736
and I'll tell you what time
for you to be back here.

627
01:03:41,238 --> 01:03:44,491
Take the baby with you.
Mahtob can stay here with me.

628
01:04:06,680 --> 01:04:10,559
- You are American?
- Yes.

629
01:04:11,643 --> 01:04:14,146
I need dozaari for the telephone.

630
01:04:14,354 --> 01:04:18,942
I was in America many times.
New York. Amarillo, Texas.

631
01:04:21,028 --> 01:04:22,738
You want to telephone?

632
01:04:24,281 --> 01:04:26,783
Please. Come. Please.

633
01:04:36,084 --> 01:04:37,586
Thank you.

634
01:04:42,716 --> 01:04:46,261
American Interests section.
Nicole Adjanian.

635
01:04:47,346 --> 01:04:51,809
Nicole, it's Betty. Have you heard anything
from the State Department?

636
01:04:53,435 --> 01:04:55,896
No, I can't.

637
01:04:56,104 --> 01:05:00,526
Because he watches me all the time
or he has somebody watch me.

638
01:05:01,819 --> 01:05:06,323
I didn't know that.
Will they let us go if I get a divorce?

639
01:05:08,659 --> 01:05:10,118
What?

640
01:05:11,370 --> 01:05:15,541
I can't do that... I can't do that.

641
01:05:17,793 --> 01:05:22,506
I won't leave her.
Nicole... Nicole, I won't leave her!

642
01:05:24,716 --> 01:05:27,928
All right. I'll get to the Embassy if I can.

643
01:05:39,314 --> 01:05:41,567
Thank you. You're very kind.

644
01:05:41,775 --> 01:05:45,487
You can use the telephone
when you want. No problem.

645
01:05:46,780 --> 01:05:50,200
- Thank you.
- I like America very much.

646
01:05:50,409 --> 01:05:53,078
My son was with University of Texas.

647
01:05:54,454 --> 01:05:56,373
That is my son.

648
01:05:56,582 --> 01:05:58,625
He is a martyr for the war.

649
01:06:00,711 --> 01:06:05,799
My name is Hamid.
Any time for telephone, you come here.

650
01:06:09,303 --> 01:06:11,346
I'm Betty.

651
01:06:16,518 --> 01:06:20,898
- Who'll take me to school tomorrow?
- I don't know, honey.

652
01:06:21,106 --> 01:06:24,026
It'll either be me or it'll be Daddy.

653
01:06:24,234 --> 01:06:28,030
- But I want you to.
- I don't know if I can, Mahtob.

654
01:06:29,615 --> 01:06:32,075
Why can't you?

655
01:06:33,869 --> 01:06:35,370
Honey...

656
01:06:38,040 --> 01:06:42,211
I promise you I'll be there
and everything will be all right.

657
01:06:44,046 --> 01:06:45,547
OK?

658
01:06:47,841 --> 01:06:49,343
Come on.

659
01:06:50,469 --> 01:06:52,137
- Dear Lord.
- Dear Lord.

660
01:06:52,346 --> 01:06:54,014
- Hear our prayer.
- Hear our prayer.

661
01:06:54,223 --> 01:06:57,851
- We beg you to help us leave Iran.
- We beg you to help us leave Iran.

662
01:06:58,060 --> 01:07:01,939
- And get back to America.
- And get back to America.

663
01:07:05,901 --> 01:07:11,907
I'll be back this afternoon, sweetheart.
I'll be back. I'll be back, sweetheart.

664
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,160
Sweetheart, I'll be back.
I'll be here, sweetheart.

665
01:07:15,369 --> 01:07:19,498
- I don't wanna go! Daddy, please!
- Don't worry, baby.

666
01:07:19,706 --> 01:07:26,088
Mommy, please! Mommy, don't leave me!
Don't leave me!

667
01:08:01,999 --> 01:08:05,627
Nasserine, take the baby. I'll get the rice.

668
01:08:14,428 --> 01:08:16,096
Hamid. I can't stay.

669
01:08:16,305 --> 01:08:19,725
You must come inside.
There is someone here.

670
01:08:25,063 --> 01:08:28,025
Miss Nassimi. She came to help you.

671
01:08:30,444 --> 01:08:32,988
Hamid told me you wished to leave Iran.

672
01:08:33,197 --> 01:08:35,532
You know it is extremely dangerous.

673
01:08:35,741 --> 01:08:37,951
I have to get back to the United States.

674
01:08:38,160 --> 01:08:41,205
- Why don't you try to get a divorce?
- No.

675
01:08:41,413 --> 01:08:45,042
If I get a divorce, my husband
will get custody of my daughter.

676
01:08:45,250 --> 01:08:48,795
If they catch you with your daughter,
they could execute you.

677
01:08:49,004 --> 01:08:51,173
- I can't leave her. I have to...
- Please.

678
01:08:52,257 --> 01:08:55,636
Wait. I think we can help you.

679
01:08:55,844 --> 01:08:58,096
My brother has helped many people here.

680
01:08:58,305 --> 01:09:02,601
I will be here Wednesday and Thursday
at this time if you can come.

681
01:09:04,228 --> 01:09:08,398
Here is my telephone number.
Memorise it, please. Don't keep it.

682
01:09:12,653 --> 01:09:14,112
Thank you.

683
01:09:18,617 --> 01:09:20,077
Betty!

684
01:09:25,499 --> 01:09:27,376
I got the rice.

685
01:09:28,752 --> 01:09:30,420
Sorry.

686
01:09:39,096 --> 01:09:41,515
What happened?

687
01:09:41,723 --> 01:09:43,767
She was crying all day again.

688
01:09:45,018 --> 01:09:47,104
I had to go pick her up.

689
01:09:47,312 --> 01:09:50,274
We can't make her do this, Moody.
She's frightened.

690
01:09:50,482 --> 01:09:55,821
I know. Tomorrow they want you
to go to school with her.

691
01:09:56,029 --> 01:09:57,364
OK.

692
01:09:58,448 --> 01:10:00,868
They want you to stay with her every day.

693
01:10:01,076 --> 01:10:04,288
Of course. Of course I'll stay with her.

694
01:10:05,372 --> 01:10:07,708
They're all devout women there.

695
01:10:09,084 --> 01:10:11,128
You'll be watched.

696
01:10:13,088 --> 01:10:14,715
OK.

697
01:10:16,383 --> 01:10:19,386
I just want Mahtob to be happy.

698
01:10:19,595 --> 01:10:22,931
I want her to have a happy childhood.
Don't you want that?

699
01:10:23,140 --> 01:10:26,602
Islam's the greatest gift
I can give my child.

700
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:08,370
You said there'd be no danger.
Mahtob could have been killed!

701
01:12:08,579 --> 01:12:13,208
America's doing this. Who supplies the
bombs, the planes? Who's backing Iraq?

702
01:12:13,417 --> 01:12:17,546
Don't be so naive. America's responsible
for this war, no one else!

703
01:12:37,191 --> 01:12:40,194
You should not behave this way.

704
01:12:40,402 --> 01:12:42,362
I had to tell Hormoz.

705
01:12:42,571 --> 01:12:45,949
It is your duty as a wife
to tell your husband everything!

706
01:12:46,158 --> 01:12:48,202
You cannot have secrets!

707
01:13:30,702 --> 01:13:33,455
Very nice. Very nice.

708
01:13:41,213 --> 01:13:44,967
Mahtob... very nice.

709
01:13:45,175 --> 01:13:46,885
Very nice.

710
01:13:50,097 --> 01:13:55,310
I am very sorry... It's bad in Iran.

711
01:13:55,519 --> 01:13:58,147
Bad for you... your husband.

712
01:13:59,314 --> 01:14:01,150
I'm sorry.

713
01:14:03,110 --> 01:14:07,281
We help you. We help you. Help you.

714
01:14:09,283 --> 01:14:12,744
- Could I use the telephone?
- Telephone? Nah! Nah.

715
01:14:16,248 --> 01:14:22,296
Husband, no telephone.
You inside. You inside.

716
01:14:22,504 --> 01:14:24,006
Right.

717
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:30,762
You come after morning. Eleven.

718
01:14:30,971 --> 01:14:34,516
- After morning.
- I can come late with Mahtob?

719
01:14:39,980 --> 01:14:42,524
Thank you.

720
01:14:43,775 --> 01:14:46,737
<i>There are three principal ways
out of Iran.</i>

721
01:14:47,821 --> 01:14:52,201
You could go to Baluchistan and then
across the mountains into Pakistan.

722
01:14:52,409 --> 01:14:57,039
In the south-west to Bandar Abbas,
then across the Gulf by boat to Oman.

723
01:14:57,247 --> 01:14:59,291
This is the most dangerous route.

724
01:14:59,500 --> 01:15:04,505
From Tehran, across the Zagros
Mountains, through Kurdistan into Turkey.

725
01:15:04,713 --> 01:15:08,008
There are checkpoints
and the border's heavily armed.

726
01:15:08,217 --> 01:15:11,553
- Which way do you think is best?
- The Gulf.

727
01:15:14,556 --> 01:15:16,391
How much will it cost?

728
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:21,939
When you and your daughter are back in
America, perhaps you will reimburse me.

729
01:15:22,147 --> 01:15:26,318
Dollars would be of more help to me
than Iranian currency.

730
01:15:28,654 --> 01:15:30,697
Keep in touch with my sister.

731
01:15:30,906 --> 01:15:32,908
Right.

732
01:15:37,746 --> 01:15:40,040
<i>Run! Run!</i>

733
01:15:44,962 --> 01:15:47,714
- Where were you?
- Stop it, Daddy!

734
01:15:47,923 --> 01:15:49,925
Where have you been?!

735
01:16:00,644 --> 01:16:02,604
Mommy!

736
01:16:02,813 --> 01:16:05,983
- Mommy!
- Get up! Get up!

737
01:16:16,577 --> 01:16:20,080
I'm gonna kill you! I'm gonna cut you up!
You're gonna be dead!

738
01:16:25,169 --> 01:16:26,670
Get out.

739
01:16:42,561 --> 01:16:43,896
Betty!

740
01:16:48,233 --> 01:16:49,651
Betty!

741
01:17:23,936 --> 01:17:25,771
Nicole Adjanian.

742
01:17:25,979 --> 01:17:27,898
Nicole Adjanian.

743
01:17:29,650 --> 01:17:33,904
Nicole? He's gonna kill me.
He's gonna kill me.

744
01:17:34,112 --> 01:17:36,615
He said he was gonna kill me.

745
01:17:54,675 --> 01:17:57,386
She is from the Embassy.
I need to take Mahtob.

746
01:18:00,556 --> 01:18:03,183
Nah, nah! Impossible. Child goes to father.

747
01:18:03,392 --> 01:18:06,186
He's going to kill me.
I have to get my daughter.

748
01:18:06,395 --> 01:18:08,522
Madam, you wait, husband come.

749
01:18:08,730 --> 01:18:11,316
- I want my baby!
- Madam! Madam!

750
01:18:11,525 --> 01:18:14,236
I want my baby! I want my baby!

751
01:18:14,444 --> 01:18:17,364
I want my baby!

752
01:18:17,573 --> 01:18:19,992
Betty, they won't let you take her.

753
01:18:20,200 --> 01:18:23,662
The State Department want you
to go to the Iranian Foreign Minister.

754
01:18:23,871 --> 01:18:30,043
No! The State Department don't understand
the culture. They'll only make things worse!

755
01:18:30,252 --> 01:18:34,173
- You wait for your husband.
- Tell her I want my baby. I want my baby!

756
01:18:36,633 --> 01:18:40,137
I cannot. Please, please...

757
01:19:21,094 --> 01:19:23,305
Listen, honey, don't talk right now.

758
01:19:23,514 --> 01:19:27,643
Because I have to tell you you can't talk
about Hamid or the Embassy

759
01:19:27,851 --> 01:19:31,021
because if you do,
they'll never let us get away.

760
01:19:31,230 --> 01:19:34,399
Don't say anything. Do you hear me?

761
01:19:36,485 --> 01:19:39,363
Mommy, don't leave me. Don't go away.

762
01:19:39,571 --> 01:19:41,990
I promise you. I promise I won't leave you.

763
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:44,701
Do you hear? I won't leave you.

764
01:19:53,210 --> 01:19:57,339
- Where are Mammal and Nasserine?
- You, don't ask questions.

765
01:20:00,926 --> 01:20:03,595
Is that enough for you, sweetheart?

766
01:20:11,436 --> 01:20:13,480
They've moved in with Ameh Bozorg.

767
01:20:29,037 --> 01:20:31,623
- Moody, what are you doing?
- Mommy!

768
01:20:31,832 --> 01:20:35,377
Please don't take her!
Moody! Moody! Please!

769
01:20:35,586 --> 01:20:39,214
Please don't take her!
Moody, please don't take her! Moody!

770
01:20:39,423 --> 01:20:42,092
Moody, please! Moody!

771
01:20:46,430 --> 01:20:48,807
Moody!

772
01:20:49,016 --> 01:20:51,185
Moody!

773
01:20:52,019 --> 01:20:55,606
Moody, don't take her! Don't take her!

774
01:21:00,611 --> 01:21:05,073
Does Mommy take you on adventures?
Come on, where does she take you?

775
01:21:05,282 --> 01:21:07,493
To Koran class.

776
01:21:07,701 --> 01:21:09,786
We saw some camels.

777
01:21:09,995 --> 01:21:11,497
Yeah?

778
01:21:12,789 --> 01:21:14,833
You go anywhere else?

779
01:21:17,336 --> 01:21:19,922
How come you were
late for school yesterday?

780
01:21:20,130 --> 01:21:23,133
- We got lost.
- No, you didn't! I know you didn't!

781
01:21:23,342 --> 01:21:25,594
- We did!
- Where the hell where you?!

782
01:21:28,180 --> 01:21:30,015
- Where were you?!
- We got lost!

783
01:21:30,224 --> 01:21:32,601
- Where were you?!
- We got lost!

784
01:22:17,521 --> 01:22:19,022
Moody?

785
01:22:20,691 --> 01:22:23,068
Moody, please don't leave.

786
01:22:24,611 --> 01:22:29,408
How's Mahtob? Please!
Please don't leave. Is she all right?

787
01:23:13,202 --> 01:23:16,455
Mahtob. Mahtob.

788
01:23:37,476 --> 01:23:39,353
<i>Betty?</i>

789
01:23:41,230 --> 01:23:42,773
Betty?

790
01:23:55,702 --> 01:23:58,080
Mahtob. Mahtob.

791
01:23:58,288 --> 01:24:01,625
You brought her back to me.
Thank you. Thank you.

792
01:24:03,293 --> 01:24:07,130
My baby. Thank you, Moody.

793
01:24:12,136 --> 01:24:19,434
<i>Happy birthday to you
Happy birthday to you</i>

794
01:24:19,643 --> 01:24:23,939
<i>Happy birthday, dear Mahtob</i>

795
01:24:24,148 --> 01:24:27,693
<i>Happy birthday to you</i>

796
01:25:17,117 --> 01:25:20,204
- Will you be all right?
- Yes, but when will you be back?

797
01:25:20,412 --> 01:25:25,000
- I'll be back as soon as I can. Be brave.
- I will.

798
01:25:44,728 --> 01:25:46,897
We will fly you to Bandar Abbas

799
01:25:47,105 --> 01:25:50,609
and then take you by speedboat
across the Gulf.

800
01:25:55,739 --> 01:25:58,408
I'll never be able to thank you.

801
01:25:59,993 --> 01:26:02,663
Please, Betty. There's really no need.

802
01:26:05,374 --> 01:26:09,044
Just make the journey safely.

803
01:26:13,966 --> 01:26:16,885
I wish you could have seen this
in the summer.

804
01:26:18,512 --> 01:26:21,265
All the flowers have gone now, of course.

805
01:26:21,473 --> 01:26:25,102
Gardens have always
had a special place in Persia.

806
01:26:25,310 --> 01:26:27,437
Throughout our history.

807
01:26:27,646 --> 01:26:30,732
In fact, the word "paradise"
is a Persian word.

808
01:26:32,734 --> 01:26:35,320
It's hard to believe
that the idea of paradise

809
01:26:35,529 --> 01:26:38,615
will always be
intimately connected with Iran.

810
01:26:40,909 --> 01:26:46,081
Whenever I think of what's happening to
my country, I try to remember its gardens.

811
01:26:49,960 --> 01:26:53,088
You must try and phone me now
whenever you can.

812
01:26:55,048 --> 01:26:56,758
By Christmas you'll be home.

813
01:27:10,147 --> 01:27:11,815
Betty.

814
01:27:17,571 --> 01:27:20,449
Merry Christmas.

815
01:27:21,909 --> 01:27:24,077
<i>I'm sorry. The Gulf got too dangerous.</i>

816
01:27:24,286 --> 01:27:27,706
Warships are checking
all the civilian boats.

817
01:27:27,915 --> 01:27:31,627
Zahedan is safer, so I've booked
a flight for you and Mahtob

818
01:27:31,835 --> 01:27:35,380
on Wednesday 29th January,
ten days from now.

819
01:27:35,589 --> 01:27:39,676
Wednesday. Good.
Moody's at the hospital on Wednesdays.

820
01:27:39,885 --> 01:27:43,597
On the 29th, take Mahtob
to the school bus as usual.

821
01:27:43,806 --> 01:27:46,183
We will pick you both up
from the bus stop,

822
01:27:46,391 --> 01:27:49,353
take you to a safe house
until it's time to go.

823
01:27:52,064 --> 01:27:54,441
<i>Was he in pain?</i>

824
01:27:55,984 --> 01:27:57,486
Is he now?

825
01:27:59,029 --> 01:28:02,115
How much? How long has he known?

826
01:28:03,700 --> 01:28:07,371
- So he's not responding to the treatment?
- What is it?

827
01:28:09,873 --> 01:28:13,502
- And they offered that?
- What?

828
01:28:13,710 --> 01:28:16,547
Mother, would you hold on for a moment?

829
01:28:16,755 --> 01:28:21,176
It's my father. He's not doing well.
They feel they should operate and...

830
01:28:21,385 --> 01:28:26,390
Tell her you'll go to America to see him.
Tell her you're going. Go on.

831
01:28:26,598 --> 01:28:30,060
Tell her you're going to see him.
Tell her now.

832
01:28:35,941 --> 01:28:39,361
Mom? Moody says we can come home.

833
01:28:45,409 --> 01:28:49,037
- I'm sorry about your father.
- Thank you.

834
01:29:00,174 --> 01:29:02,843
Will you be able to come home with us?

835
01:29:03,051 --> 01:29:07,181
No, I can't go.
I'd lose my job at the hospital.

836
01:29:08,974 --> 01:29:13,770
- But it's all right for Mahtob to come?
- No. You'll have to go on your own.

837
01:29:18,609 --> 01:29:21,570
- I can't go without Mahtob.
- Why not?

838
01:29:21,778 --> 01:29:24,865
You'll see your father.
What's the problem?

839
01:29:27,284 --> 01:29:29,578
I won't go without her.

840
01:29:37,127 --> 01:29:39,087
Betty...

841
01:29:40,756 --> 01:29:42,883
You'll leave as soon as possible.

842
01:29:43,091 --> 01:29:46,720
You'll see your father
and liquidate all our assets in the States.

843
01:29:50,974 --> 01:29:53,644
It's my money and I want it!

844
01:29:55,562 --> 01:29:58,857
Don't do it, Betty.
You'll never see your daughter again.

845
01:29:59,066 --> 01:30:03,570
- He won't allow you back in the country.
- My father is dying.

846
01:30:03,779 --> 01:30:07,199
I don't think he'd want you to
if it meant losing your daughter.

847
01:30:07,407 --> 01:30:10,744
Why can't I go now, come back
and later try to get out?

848
01:30:10,953 --> 01:30:14,581
You can't leave Mahtob here,
not with Moody's family.

849
01:30:14,790 --> 01:30:17,584
They're from the provinces,
more fanatical than most.

850
01:30:17,793 --> 01:30:19,795
This regime encourages them.

851
01:30:20,003 --> 01:30:24,800
Some people here consider a girl
ready for marriage at nine years of age.

852
01:30:25,008 --> 01:30:27,052
Child brides are not unknown.

853
01:30:27,261 --> 01:30:30,639
If you want to be free, with Mahtob,

854
01:30:30,848 --> 01:30:34,309
you've got to leave on the 29th
as we agreed.

855
01:30:34,518 --> 01:30:39,273
But he may send me out before,
maybe tomorrow. He hasn't said.

856
01:30:49,408 --> 01:30:51,034
For the war.

857
01:30:51,243 --> 01:30:54,705
They take them younger and younger.
12 years old, some of them.

858
01:30:54,913 --> 01:30:58,250
They give them plastic keys to paradise,
made in Taiwan,

859
01:30:58,458 --> 01:31:01,628
and tell them they'll go
straight to heaven if they die.

860
01:31:01,837 --> 01:31:04,381
They use them sometimes
to clear minefields.

861
01:31:04,590 --> 01:31:07,217
They run across the field
and get blown to pieces.

862
01:31:08,927 --> 01:31:10,262
OK.

863
01:31:14,725 --> 01:31:16,852
We've only a week to go.

864
01:31:17,060 --> 01:31:22,274
He's got to get your passport validated.
He can't do it in the time. It's impossible.

865
01:31:22,483 --> 01:31:26,403
He trusts you now.
Try and do anything you can to delay him.

866
01:31:27,946 --> 01:31:31,700
- Where were you?
- Moody. I went to the market.

867
01:31:32,868 --> 01:31:37,080
I wanted to buy my father some gifts
but I couldn't find anything.

868
01:31:37,289 --> 01:31:39,333
The one day I come home early.

869
01:31:41,502 --> 01:31:45,255
I've let you go. I've given you freedom.

870
01:31:47,716 --> 01:31:50,344
OK. Listen to me.

871
01:31:50,552 --> 01:31:56,892
If you don't do as I say, I'll lock you up
and you'll never see Mahtob again.

872
01:31:57,100 --> 01:32:00,020
On the 26th
you get on that plane to America.

873
01:32:00,229 --> 01:32:03,190
You send everything back here
and then you return.

874
01:32:03,398 --> 01:32:08,195
In the meantime, do not touch the phone
or set foot out of the house. Is that clear?

875
01:32:08,403 --> 01:32:09,738
Yes.

876
01:32:11,448 --> 01:32:13,575
Moody?

877
01:32:13,784 --> 01:32:18,163
- You booked for the 26th?
- What do you mean? Of course I booked.

878
01:32:18,372 --> 01:32:20,916
You got the validation?
Remember last time?

879
01:32:21,124 --> 01:32:24,753
Zia knows people. It's all been done.

880
01:32:38,016 --> 01:32:41,979
I hope your father gets well.
I'm sorry we can't see you off tomorrow.

881
01:32:42,187 --> 01:32:45,357
Please come back to us. We love you.

882
01:32:56,618 --> 01:32:58,829
They want me to go back to the hospital.

883
01:33:09,590 --> 01:33:11,091
I gotta go.

884
01:33:45,792 --> 01:33:47,836
I have to go to the market.

885
01:33:48,045 --> 01:33:52,049
There's a few things that I need.
It'll take me about 20 minutes.

886
01:33:52,257 --> 01:33:54,968
- I'll go.
- No, no. It's all right.

887
01:33:55,177 --> 01:33:56,887
I need some fresh air.

888
01:33:57,095 --> 01:34:01,141
I'd like to buy some gifts for my father.
There's been no time.

889
01:34:14,696 --> 01:34:19,034
Honey? Mahtob,
get your scarf and your jacket.

890
01:35:05,247 --> 01:35:07,249
Houssein.

891
01:35:08,959 --> 01:35:11,295
Houssein.

892
01:35:15,716 --> 01:35:17,759
Houssein, I have her with me.

893
01:35:17,968 --> 01:35:21,972
This is the last chance I have.
We have to leave now.

894
01:35:31,982 --> 01:35:33,817
Betty. Come.

895
01:35:38,864 --> 01:35:42,743
My brother wants you
to call your husband and delay him.

896
01:35:42,951 --> 01:35:47,122
First I must call Houssein
and tell him you're safe.

897
01:35:49,708 --> 01:35:52,961
- I forgot Toby Bunny.
- What?

898
01:35:54,004 --> 01:35:56,131
I forgot Toby Bunny.

899
01:35:56,340 --> 01:36:00,260
Honey... Honey, do you want
to go home to America?

900
01:36:01,345 --> 01:36:04,139
Mahtob, stop crying.

901
01:36:04,348 --> 01:36:06,517
Stop crying.

902
01:36:07,935 --> 01:36:09,561
Listen now.

903
01:36:10,479 --> 01:36:14,107
If we go back for Toby Bunny,
we have to stay with Daddy.

904
01:36:14,316 --> 01:36:17,110
Do you want that?

905
01:36:17,319 --> 01:36:19,905
But when will I see my daddy again?

906
01:36:20,113 --> 01:36:22,324
I don't know.

907
01:36:25,786 --> 01:36:27,287
Stop crying now.

908
01:36:28,455 --> 01:36:30,541
I love you.

909
01:36:30,749 --> 01:36:33,544
I love you. You be my big, brave girl.

910
01:36:36,964 --> 01:36:38,298
All right.

911
01:36:38,507 --> 01:36:43,137
<i>- Moody, I'm not gonna get on that plane.
- Why not? What are you planning?</i>

912
01:36:43,345 --> 01:36:46,140
Nothing. I'm not planning anything.

913
01:36:46,348 --> 01:36:49,351
<i>- I'll call the police.
- Go ahead and call the police.</i>

914
01:36:49,560 --> 01:36:52,521
<i>- There are things I'd like to tell them.
- Like what?</i>

915
01:36:52,729 --> 01:36:57,401
Like I know the clinic isn't legal.
You don't have an operating permit.

916
01:36:57,609 --> 01:37:02,489
I found out. I sit there all day long.
You think I wouldn't notice?!

917
01:37:02,698 --> 01:37:05,325
<i>I'm only trying to be good to you.</i>

918
01:37:05,534 --> 01:37:08,912
<i>- Yes.
- We don't need the police.</i>

919
01:37:09,121 --> 01:37:13,542
I agree. That won't be necessary.

920
01:37:13,750 --> 01:37:18,172
<i>So we can get together
and talk about this, Betty. Betty?</i>

921
01:37:18,380 --> 01:37:20,215
I'll have to think about it.

922
01:37:20,424 --> 01:37:24,178
You'd better.
I don't believe a word you say any more.

923
01:37:26,263 --> 01:37:31,226
How could you take Mahtob away?
You're stealing my child.

924
01:37:31,435 --> 01:37:34,396
No. I'm not gonna
promise you anything, Betty.

925
01:37:34,605 --> 01:37:37,024
You're my wife. Get your ass back here!

926
01:37:39,568 --> 01:37:41,320
Hello, Betty. This is Zia.

927
01:37:41,528 --> 01:37:47,159
Zia. I want you to tell Moody
that I have a lawyer.

928
01:37:48,702 --> 01:37:50,829
Tell Moody I won't meet with him alone.

929
01:37:51,038 --> 01:37:56,835
If he wants to talk with me, I'll be there
between 11 and 12 tomorrow morning

930
01:37:57,044 --> 01:37:59,213
and six and eight tomorrow afternoon.

931
01:37:59,421 --> 01:38:01,256
You tell him that.

932
01:38:02,508 --> 01:38:07,596
We're ready. We must go. They'll
find you if you stay any longer in Tehran.

933
01:38:07,805 --> 01:38:09,598
OK. Let me get my things.

934
01:38:09,807 --> 01:38:14,061
We've had no time to organise paperwork,
so you may have difficulty in Turkey,

935
01:38:14,269 --> 01:38:16,021
but they won't send you back.

936
01:38:16,230 --> 01:38:18,774
Get to the US Embassy
when you get to Ankara.

937
01:38:18,982 --> 01:38:22,945
We'll drive you to the Zagros Mountains.
Tribesmen will take you across.

938
01:38:23,153 --> 01:38:28,033
They're Kurdish. Most are friendly.
They know how to avoid the checkpoints.

939
01:38:28,242 --> 01:38:30,619
Do not let anybody know
you're American.

940
01:38:32,120 --> 01:38:35,707
First you must be careful
of the checkpoint outside Tehran.

941
01:38:39,128 --> 01:38:40,838
Betty...

942
01:38:41,046 --> 01:38:45,175
Very soon I hope you will be strolling
again in your own garden at home.

943
01:38:45,384 --> 01:38:47,219
In America.

944
01:39:47,070 --> 01:39:48,697
Hurry.

945
01:42:34,071 --> 01:42:35,572
What?

946
01:42:43,831 --> 01:42:45,874
What are you doing?

947
01:42:46,083 --> 01:42:48,252
Oh, God, what are you doing?

948
01:42:49,169 --> 01:42:50,504
No.

949
01:42:54,842 --> 01:42:57,052
Please.

950
01:42:57,261 --> 01:42:58,971
Please.

951
01:45:23,782 --> 01:45:28,287
- Mommy? Mommy. Mommy, wake up!
- No.

952
01:45:28,495 --> 01:45:33,208
- Mommy!
- No, get off me! Get off me!

953
01:45:33,417 --> 01:45:35,252
Get off me!

954
01:47:09,680 --> 01:47:12,975
- Mommy.
- No, it's OK. It's OK.

955
01:49:56,847 --> 01:49:59,516
Turkey! Turkey!

956
01:51:47,666 --> 01:51:49,710
We're home, baby.

957
01:51:51,003 --> 01:51:53,046
- We're home.
- Mommy.

958
01:51:59,636 --> 01:52:07,603
BETTY AND MAHTOB WERE RE-UNITED WITH
THEIR FAMILY ON FEBRUARY 9TH 1986

959
01:52:07,811 --> 01:52:21,742
MANY WOMEN AND CHILDREN ARE HELD AGAINST THEIR WILL IN FOREIGN COUNTRIES. BETTY IS NOW A SUCCESSFUL
WRITER AND LECTURER DEDICATED TO HELPING THOSE WHO FIND THEMSELVES IN SIMILAR CIRCUMSTANCES.
