DEAN (V.O.): <i>Here's the dirty
little secret about being rich.</i>

3
00:01:00,675 --> 00:01:03,877
<i>It's not about the money.</i>

4
00:01:03,879 --> 00:01:06,612
<i>It's about the way people see you.</i>

5
00:01:06,614 --> 00:01:09,950
<i>The way you see yourself.</i>

6
00:01:09,952 --> 00:01:12,686
<i>Fuck money.</i>

7
00:01:12,688 --> 00:01:18,595
<i>For kids like Joe Hunt and me,
being rich is about respect.</i>

9
00:01:24,233 --> 00:01:25,832
<i>My name is Dean Karney.</i>

10
00:01:25,834 --> 00:01:29,703
<i>I grew up with parents
who were middle class...</i>

11
00:01:29,705 --> 00:01:31,537
<i>the opposite of rich.</i>

12
00:01:31,539 --> 00:01:32,739
<i>But they wanted the best for me...</i>

<i>scraped together tuition
fees to send me...</i>

14
00:01:34,709 --> 00:01:38,311
<i>to the most elite prep

<i>where I first met Joe...</i>

17
00:01:42,283 --> 00:01:44,984
<i>the scholarship kid with no friends.</i>

18
00:01:44,986 --> 00:01:48,788
<i>The only thing we had in common
is that neither of us belonged.</i>

19
00:01:48,790 --> 00:01:51,391
<i>I learned early on that
the key was to fake it...</i>

20
00:01:51,393 --> 00:01:53,659
<i>until you make it.</i>

21
00:01:53,661 --> 00:01:56,329
<i>I'd use my charm,
wit, and backhand...</i>

<i>CEO's, actual royalty.</i>

24
00:02:01,536 --> 00:02:04,237
<i>I played the part perfectly.</i>

25
00:02:04,239 --> 00:02:06,005
<i>By the time I was 25...</i>

26
00:02:06,007 --> 00:02:09,810
<i>I signed a deal worth a
quarter of a billion dollars.</i>

27
00:02:09,812 --> 00:02:13,680
<i>I had it all, the house,
the money, the girl.</i>

28
00:02:13,682 --> 00:02:16,650
<i>And I had the best

<i>In Beverly Hills, the

<i>It's the best life.</i>

31
00:02:24,326 --> 00:02:26,960
<i>So, let me go back.</i>

32
00:02:26,962 --> 00:02:29,429
<i>It all started six years after
high school and let's just...</i>

33
00:02:29,431 --> 00:02:32,299
<i>say that I wasn't exactly
living up to my full potential.</i>

34
00:02:32,301 --> 00:02:34,767
Are you ready to buy a car,
you handsome son of a bitch?

35
00:02:34,769 --> 00:02:36,302
What do you got?

36
00:02:36,304 --> 00:02:37,570
Well, I got a Bentley.

37
00:02:37,572 --> 00:02:38,838
Boring.

38
00:02:38,840 --> 00:02:41,008
What? You don't like a Bentley?

39
00:02:41,010 --> 00:02:45,682
I got a 1979 IROC driven by
Stallone for three months.

40
00:02:48,350 --> 00:02:50,286
I got a Corvette.

41
00:02:51,754 --> 00:02:53,423
Let me see the 'Vette.

42
00:02:56,624 --> 00:03:00,993
DEAN (V.O.): <i>And there
he was, my old classmate.</i>

43
00:03:00,995 --> 00:03:03,296
<i>He hadn't changed a bit.</i>

44
00:03:03,298 --> 00:03:04,664
If we take the over and the under...

45
00:03:04,666 --> 00:03:08,367
DEAN (V.O.): <i>He was still
the smartest guy in the room.</i>

46
00:03:08,369 --> 00:03:10,772
<i>Still wearing the cheapest suit.</i>

47
00:03:13,374 --> 00:03:15,342
Sorry, ahh...

48
00:03:15,344 --> 00:03:16,475
Corvette.

49
00:03:16,477 --> 00:03:18,280
Mr. Ioku... thank you.

50
00:03:19,781 --> 00:03:22,415
- Dean.
- Joe.

51
00:03:22,417 --> 00:03:24,418
- It's been forever.
- Way too long.

52
00:03:24,420 --> 00:03:26,086
Come here, man.

53
00:03:26,088 --> 00:03:30,356
So, making moves, what have you been up to?

54
00:03:30,358 --> 00:03:32,325
I am working at the Pacific Stock Exchange.

55
00:03:32,327 --> 00:03:34,694
Wall Street of the West, nice.

56
00:03:34,696 --> 00:03:36,096
And what are you up to?

57
00:03:36,098 --> 00:03:40,099
A bit of this, a bit of that.

58
00:03:40,101 --> 00:03:42,336
Are you living downtown?

59
00:03:42,338 --> 00:03:43,969
I'm still living with my father.

60
00:03:43,971 --> 00:03:45,338
Are you shitting me?

61
00:03:45,340 --> 00:03:46,907
Are they not paying you?

62
00:03:46,909 --> 00:03:48,444
Barely.

63
00:03:52,681 --> 00:03:54,848
Is that cash?

64
00:03:54,850 --> 00:03:57,516
Yeah, I just sold the Biltmores a Corvette.

65
00:03:57,518 --> 00:03:59,652
Joe, you shouldn't be
working for these guys.

66
00:03:59,654 --> 00:04:02,122
You should be these guys.
You've gotta get your own thing.

67
00:04:02,124 --> 00:04:05,425
Thanks, I appreciate it.

68
00:04:05,427 --> 00:04:10,497
That would take investors, and
money, and things I don't have.

69
00:04:10,499 --> 00:04:12,435
You know, we would make the perfect team.

70
00:04:14,535 --> 00:04:16,702
Come to Spago tonight. It's
Charlie Bottom's birthday.

71
00:04:16,704 --> 00:04:18,372
We could go talk to him.

72
00:04:18,374 --> 00:04:19,572
Charlie Bottoms from high school?

73
00:04:19,574 --> 00:04:20,807
Yeah.

74
00:04:20,809 --> 00:04:21,908
Yeah, I don't think he's gonna
want to give me his money, Dean.

75
00:04:21,910 --> 00:04:24,944
Of course, he will. Just do
what you did to those guys.

76
00:04:24,946 --> 00:04:26,780
You know, pitch 'em gold.

77
00:04:26,782 --> 00:04:29,882
I don't think so. These
guys hated me in high school.

78
00:04:29,884 --> 00:04:31,117
I can't.

79
00:04:31,119 --> 00:04:32,853
Yes, Joe, you can.

80
00:04:32,855 --> 00:04:35,988
With your brains and my connections.

81
00:04:35,990 --> 00:04:38,427
Think about it, we could own this town.

82
00:04:42,131 --> 00:04:45,601
That's a yes, right? That
looks like a yes to me.

83
00:04:47,169 --> 00:04:49,603
- Okay.
- Yes, Joe!

84
00:04:49,605 --> 00:04:50,603
Okay.

85
00:04:50,605 --> 00:04:52,773
So it is Spago at 9:00
and it's a costume party.

86
00:04:52,775 --> 00:04:54,540
We'll both go as Reagan's.

87
00:04:54,542 --> 00:04:57,576
You're going come, right? Promise?

88
00:04:57,578 --> 00:04:58,711
Yeah.

89
00:04:58,713 --> 00:04:59,612
Okay, cool.

90
00:04:59,614 --> 00:05:01,617
See you later. It's great to see you, man.

91
00:05:06,888 --> 00:05:09,956
DEAN (V.O.): <i>L.A. was
never a nine-to-five town.</i>

92
00:05:09,958 --> 00:05:12,459
<i>Deals were made at night
at places so exclusive...</i>

93
00:05:12,461 --> 00:05:15,595
<i>just getting in meant you
had your checkbook ready.</i>

94
00:05:15,597 --> 00:05:18,632
<i>Most exclusive of all was
Spago, which is where...</i>

95
00:05:18,634 --> 00:05:22,735
<i>Charlie Bottoms was holding
his 23rd birthday bash.</i>

96
00:05:22,737 --> 00:05:24,905
<i>Halloween in July.</i>

97
00:05:24,907 --> 00:05:27,641
Sorry, kid, it's a private party.

98
00:05:27,643 --> 00:05:30,543
Oh no, I'm invited. I'm
here with Dean Karney.

99
00:05:30,545 --> 00:05:32,978
- Oh yeah, sure you are.
- Yeah.

100
00:05:32,980 --> 00:05:35,548
I pity tha muthafucka'! Back of the line!

101
00:05:35,550 --> 00:05:38,718
No, it is Charlie Bottoms
birthday and I'm joining him.

102
00:05:38,720 --> 00:05:40,989
Make a hole! Make a hole!

103
00:05:50,064 --> 00:05:53,502
Get out of the way.

104
00:05:57,573 --> 00:05:58,975
Ladies.

105
00:06:00,107 --> 00:06:01,540
Dean! Hey!

106
00:06:01,542 --> 00:06:02,742
- DEAN: Joe!
- There he is.

107
00:06:02,744 --> 00:06:06,612
Joe, what are you doing? Come on in.

108
00:06:06,614 --> 00:06:08,615
Charlie will be 24 by
the time we get inside.

109
00:06:08,617 --> 00:06:10,115
Come on, Mr. T, may we?

110
00:06:10,117 --> 00:06:12,052
- You got it.
- Thank you.

111
00:06:12,054 --> 00:06:13,823
- Thank you.
- See you later.

112
00:06:21,730 --> 00:06:24,163
Dude, what happened to
us both being Reagan?

113
00:06:24,165 --> 00:06:30,005
We are both Reagan, I'm Nancy.
It's called edge, come on.

114
00:06:31,973 --> 00:06:33,572
Holy shit.

115
00:06:33,574 --> 00:06:34,944
Right, I told you, dude.

116
00:06:36,711 --> 00:06:39,014
Ladies, it is so good to see you.

117
00:06:41,249 --> 00:06:42,548
You're late.

118
00:06:42,550 --> 00:06:45,185
And you are beautiful.

119
00:06:45,187 --> 00:06:48,187
You are forgiven. Charity case?

120
00:06:48,189 --> 00:06:49,826
- Old friend.
- I'm Joe.

121
00:06:52,761 --> 00:06:56,730
DEAN (V.O.): <i>The girls at
Spago were out of control.</i>

122
00:06:56,732 --> 00:07:00,165
<i>We ran with a pack of
babes called, The Groovers.</i>

123
00:07:00,167 --> 00:07:02,668
<i>When any new scene hit LA...</i>

124
00:07:02,670 --> 00:07:04,873
<i>they were always on
the crest of the wave.</i>

00:07:07,208 --> 00:07:12,011
<i>♪ They're making
it your intention ♪</i>

126
00:07:12,013 --> 00:07:17,117
<i>♪ Love those dreams
Scheme those schemes ♪</i>

127
00:07:17,119 --> 00:07:21,588
DEAN (V.O.): <i>You don't come to
California for the sunshine.</i>

128
00:07:21,590 --> 00:07:24,727
<i>You come for girls
like Sydney Evans.</i>

129
00:07:36,804 --> 00:07:38,572
Mean Dean.

130
00:07:38,574 --> 00:07:41,341
Hey, Delicious.

131
00:07:41,343 --> 00:07:46,045
- You know her?
- Are you ready?

132
00:07:46,047 --> 00:07:50,050
- What was that for?
- Edge.

133
00:07:50,052 --> 00:07:53,218
There they are! My boys!

134
00:07:53,220 --> 00:07:56,021
Gentlemen, allow me to introduce to you...

135
00:07:56,023 --> 00:07:59,793
our semi-assassinated
President, Joe Hunt...

136
00:07:59,795 --> 00:08:01,595
a very close friend of mine.

137
00:08:01,597 --> 00:08:04,730
Joe, you remember Kyle and Scott Biltmore.

138
00:08:04,732 --> 00:08:07,300
Man, that shit is twisted! I love it!

139
00:08:07,302 --> 00:08:10,002
DEAN (V.O.): <i>This crew was
the epitome of a good time.</i>

140
00:08:10,004 --> 00:08:13,706
<i>Which meant the world
clamored to be around them.</i>

141
00:08:13,708 --> 00:08:16,910
<i>I once watched Tom Cruise's
date excuse herself to go...</i>

142
00:08:16,912 --> 00:08:19,144
<i>to the ladies room, only to
leave out the back door...</i>

143
00:08:19,146 --> 00:08:20,947
<i>with both Biltmores.</i>

144
00:08:20,949 --> 00:08:23,917
<i>Then there was Charlie Bottoms.</i>

145
00:08:23,919 --> 00:08:25,384
<i>Aside from being blessed
with good looks...</i>

146
00:08:25,386 --> 00:08:29,055
<i>he was a mastermind in business.</i>

147
00:08:29,057 --> 00:08:32,359
<i>And what did all three of these
Harvard alumni have in common?</i>

148
00:08:32,361 --> 00:08:33,494
<i>Money.</i>

149
00:08:33,496 --> 00:08:36,696
<i>These were the richest
kids in Beverly Hills.</i>

150
00:08:36,698 --> 00:08:37,797
Happy birthday, Charlie.

151
00:08:37,799 --> 00:08:40,133
Thanks for coming.

152
00:08:40,135 --> 00:08:44,803
<i>(FUNK MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

153
00:08:44,805 --> 00:08:46,708
Got you a gift, Charlie.

154
00:08:54,915 --> 00:08:57,216
What's this, gold?

155
00:08:57,218 --> 00:09:00,052
I've been studying the market
going back forty quarters.

156
00:09:00,054 --> 00:09:02,889
And if we invest in gold right now.

157
00:09:02,891 --> 00:09:04,356
My dad is in gold.

158
00:09:04,358 --> 00:09:06,025
And he says the market's gonna tank.

159
00:09:06,027 --> 00:09:08,128
How is the system going to handle that?

160
00:09:08,130 --> 00:09:09,796
That's why we reverse gold.

161
00:09:09,798 --> 00:09:11,831
We buy and sell a pair of puts and calls...

162
00:09:11,833 --> 00:09:13,432
and set a spread against volatility.

163
00:09:13,434 --> 00:09:14,868
Hold on, shut up a minute.

164
00:09:14,870 --> 00:09:16,403
Hey, did we go to high school together?

165
00:09:16,405 --> 00:09:17,803
No, no, seriously he looks familiar.

166
00:09:17,805 --> 00:09:19,739
Shit! Yeah! Hey, I fucking know this kid!

167
00:09:19,741 --> 00:09:22,008
He was the one who was thrown
off that debate team, right?

168
00:09:22,010 --> 00:09:23,876
And then I stuffed the guy in a locker.

169
00:09:23,878 --> 00:09:25,077
We reverse gold.

170
00:09:25,079 --> 00:09:27,846
- Okay, I've got a Macallan...
- We reverse gold.

171
00:09:27,848 --> 00:09:33,855
Macallan 12, a Glenlivet, a Makers.

172
00:09:38,392 --> 00:09:40,393
Happy birthday, Charlie.

173
00:09:40,395 --> 00:09:42,327
Hey!

174

with Beverly Hills royalty.</i>

346
00:19:11,698 --> 00:19:13,732
Mean Dean gonna get this
show on the road, or what?

347
00:19:13,734 --> 00:19:16,736
Probably boning in the bathroom.

348
00:19:16,738 --> 00:19:18,407
Go get him and hurry it up!

349
00:19:19,906 --> 00:19:22,441
Dean, we took a hit in the market today.

350
00:19:22,443 --> 00:19:23,909
What? How bad?

351
00:19:23,911 --> 00:19:26,412
We wiped out.

352
00:19:26,414 --> 00:19:28,580
- All of it?
- Half.

353
00:19:28,582 --> 00:19:29,749
The rest is still in the account.

354
00:19:29,751 --> 00:19:33,586
Yo, Dean, your guests are waiting!

355
00:19:33,588 --> 00:19:37,823
Uh, just give us a second, Kyle.

356
00:19:37,825 --> 00:19:40,726
Wait, what are you doing?

357
00:19:40,728 --> 00:19:42,961
I'm giving Kyle his money back.

358
00:19:42,963 --> 00:19:44,096
What, you're gonna tell him now?

359
00:19:44,098 --> 00:19:46,432
After the presentation,
in private, yes, I have to.

360
00:19:46,434 --> 00:19:50,536
What presentation, Joe? There
is no way these guys will buy...

361
00:19:50,538 --> 00:19:52,672
our pitch if Kyle's
bitching about a wipe out.

362
00:19:52,674 --> 00:19:54,406
I know, but I don't have a choice.

363
00:19:54,408 --> 00:19:56,308
All you have is your rep.

364
00:19:56,310 --> 00:19:58,076
Dean, I'm just gonna
be honest with the guy.

365
00:19:58,078 --> 00:19:59,679
He knew there were risks
when he got involved.

366
00:19:59,681 --> 00:20:02,748
He doesn't know.

367
00:20:02,750 --> 00:20:04,950
What do you mean, he doesn't know?

368
00:20:04,952 --> 00:20:07,752
There was no apologies?

369
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:09,555
You gave me his money without him knowing?

370
00:20:09,557 --> 00:20:11,057
Sorry, I wanted to put wind in your sails.

371
00:20:11,059 --> 00:20:12,192
I should have told you the truth.

372
00:20:12,194 --> 00:20:18,530
But think how many legends
started exactly like this.

373
00:20:18,532 --> 00:20:21,499
The Kennedys were rum runners
before they ran the world.

374
00:20:21,501 --> 00:20:24,772
This is our chance, come on.

375
00:20:31,011 --> 00:20:32,912
Gentlemen, if I can have
your attention, please?

376
00:20:32,914 --> 00:20:35,548
Thank you for coming by tonight.

377
00:20:35,550 --> 00:20:37,883
Some of you may remember my friend...

378
00:20:37,885 --> 00:20:40,385
Joe Hunt from High School.

379
00:20:40,387 --> 00:20:44,056
We spoke to some of you guys
at Spago around three weeks ago.

380
00:20:44,058 --> 00:20:45,257
If you can't remember the night...

381
00:20:45,259 --> 00:20:48,728
it's the night Charlie has been
trying to forget ever since.

382
00:20:48,730 --> 00:20:50,363
No way.

383
00:20:50,365 --> 00:20:52,964
But I'm not the guy to talk
to you about the minutia...

384
00:20:52,966 --> 00:20:54,733
of why we are here.

385
00:20:54,735 --> 00:20:59,741
So, Joe? You want to...

386
00:21:01,442 --> 00:21:05,144
Want to tell them about our proposal?

387
00:21:05,146 --> 00:21:07,813
DEAN (V.O.): <i>You want
to talk about a paradox?</i>

388
00:21:07,815 --> 00:21:10,816
<i>Joe's bad break was our lucky day.</i>

389
00:21:10,818 --> 00:21:13,118
<i>When he got caught in my lie...</i>

390
00:21:13,120 --> 00:21:16,756
<i>we broke through to
a whole, new level.</i>

391
00:21:16,758 --> 00:21:21,697
<i>All he had to do was
cross one tiny line.</i>

392
00:21:24,598 --> 00:21:25,998
Gentlemen!

393
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,768
You are the young Turks
of L.A. heirs to empires...

394
00:21:28,770 --> 00:21:30,435
sons of scions.

395
00:21:30,437 --> 00:21:34,173
But, what would you do
to earn it on your own?

396
00:21:34,175 --> 00:21:37,977
To look your fathers in
the eye, not for a handout.

397
00:21:37,979 --> 00:21:41,980
But with a handful of cash,
that you pulled down, with this!

398
00:21:41,982 --> 00:21:45,984
Dump the opportunity at your
fingertips? Fuck no! Seize it.

399
00:21:45,986 --> 00:21:50,556
Now is the time to own your own destiny...

400
00:21:50,558 --> 00:21:55,861
and become part of something great!

401
00:21:55,863 --> 00:21:56,961
The BBC.

402
00:21:56,963 --> 00:22:00,566
What does BBC stand for?

403
00:22:00,568 --> 00:22:01,700
Exactly.

404
00:22:01,702 --> 00:22:03,701
Within that question lies our hook?

405
00:22:03,703 --> 00:22:08,807
Each investor will ask, "What is
BBC?" Are we a holding company?

406
00:22:08,809 --> 00:22:13,077
Are we an investment
pool? Are we a social club?

407
00:22:13,079 --> 00:22:14,747
All the above.

408
00:22:14,749 --> 00:22:18,083
Buy on mystery. Sell on history.

409
00:22:18,085 --> 00:22:20,452
I like it.

410
00:22:20,454 --> 00:22:22,221
Sounds like old money.

411
00:22:22,223 --> 00:22:24,789
Fuck old money!

412
00:22:24,791 --> 00:22:29,127
How about we make some new money?

413
00:22:29,129 --> 00:22:32,698
We all stand on the verge of
wildly profitable ventures...

414
00:22:32,700 --> 00:22:34,967
in this room alone.

415
00:22:34,969 --> 00:22:38,971
Scott, you bought a Benz
in Munich, drove it...

416
00:22:38,973 --> 00:22:43,741
across Europe and sold it right
here for twice what you paid.

417
00:22:43,743 --> 00:22:47,179
That is a hundred percent profit.

418
00:22:47,181 --> 00:22:50,215
Charlie, how many times
have you advised your dad...

419
00:22:50,217 --> 00:22:54,720
on energy stocks, only for
him to make the big move.

420
00:22:54,722 --> 00:22:58,857
And Kyle, you believed
in my trading system...

421
00:22:58,859 --> 00:23:00,792
to the tune of $10,000.

422
00:23:00,794 --> 00:23:02,728
- You what?
- I did?

423
00:23:02,730 --> 00:23:05,730
Yes! You did!

424
00:23:05,732 --> 00:23:08,166
And here's your first disbursement check!

425
00:23:08,168 --> 00:23:11,836
Wait, five thousand
dollars? Is this what's left?

426
00:23:11,838 --> 00:23:15,673
No, that is profit.

427
00:23:15,675 --> 00:23:17,843
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Instead of
admitting we lost five grand...</i>

428
00:23:17,845 --> 00:23:19,278
The rest is still in gold.

429
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:22,080
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Joe told
them we made five grand.</i>

430
00:23:22,082 --> 00:23:26,085
Fifty percent, in three weeks.

431
00:23:26,087 --> 00:23:27,720
Yeah.

432
00:23:27,722 --> 00:23:29,223
God damn.

433
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:36,060
This is just a loan.

434
00:23:36,062 --> 00:23:38,963
Okay.

435
00:23:38,965 --> 00:23:40,965
What do we do if he
asks for his money back?

436
00:23:40,967 --> 00:23:43,602
Look, Dean, this weekend?

437
00:23:43,604 --> 00:23:44,970
You're gonna scrounge up every dime...

438
00:23:44,972 --> 00:23:47,972
so we can reinvest and make his money back.

439
00:23:47,974 --> 00:23:50,643
You got it, Joe.

440
00:23:50,645 --> 00:23:53,746
So guys, think it over, let us know.

441
00:23:53,748 --> 00:23:55,079
We'll see you later.

442
00:23:55,081 --> 00:23:56,584
Bullshit.

443
00:23:59,086 --> 00:24:02,086
You guys are coming out with us tonight.

444
00:24:02,088 --> 00:24:05,924
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

445
00:24:05,926 --> 00:24:07,893
Yo, Tim!

446
00:24:07,895 --> 00:24:11,564
This cash machine, right here,
is my new best friend, Joe Hunt.

447
00:24:11,566 --> 00:24:14,299
If he ever waits in line again,
and I'll sic the wolf on you.

448
00:24:14,301 --> 00:24:16,602
He doesn't mean that,
Tim. Pleasure to meet you.

449
00:24:16,604 --> 00:24:19,571
Welcome to Spago, Mr. Hunt.

450
00:24:19,573 --> 00:24:20,873
Thanks, Tim.

451
00:24:20,875 --> 00:24:21,876
Hello, Tim.

452
00:24:23,077 --> 00:24:24,876
Ladies.

453
00:24:24,878 --> 00:24:26,578
Gentlemen, if I may.

454
00:24:26,580 --> 00:24:28,980
To Paradox Philosophy.

455
00:24:28,982 --> 00:24:31,717
Wait, wait, wait, Para-what?

456
00:24:31,719 --> 00:24:32,852
Paradox Philosophy.

457
00:24:32,854 --> 00:24:35,854
It's our theory that is
outlined in each prospectus.

458
00:24:35,856 --> 00:24:39,090
Three weeks ago, Joe blew
his pitch to you guys.

459
00:24:39,092 --> 00:24:43,127
And tonight, he made you five grand, Kyle.

460
00:24:43,129 --> 00:24:44,296
That is a paradox.

461
00:24:44,298 --> 00:24:46,065
Winning by losing.

462
00:24:46,067 --> 00:24:48,834
Seeing the paradox
allows you to do things...

463
00:24:48,836 --> 00:24:51,069
that you thought you couldn't.

464
00:24:51,071 --> 00:24:54,339
Cross lines you said you wouldn't.

465
00:24:54,341 --> 00:24:55,974
For example, Charlie.

466
00:24:55,976 --> 00:24:59,345
What is the worst thing
you can imagine doing?

467
00:24:59,347 --> 00:25:03,115
The worst? Murder?

468
00:25:03,117 --> 00:25:04,983
Okay, perfect.

469
00:25:04,985 --> 00:25:08,686
So could you kill someone
for a million dollars?

470
00:25:08,688 --> 00:25:10,021
No.

471
00:25:10,023 --> 00:25:11,323
See?

472
00:25:11,325 --> 00:25:13,124
That's a line you can't cross.

473
00:25:13,126 --> 00:25:14,626
Yeah, but who would?

474
00:25:14,628 --> 00:25:15,760
Well, no one here for sure, but...

475
00:25:15,762 --> 00:25:17,096
Kyle, what if you walked into a room...

476
00:25:17,098 --> 00:25:18,730
and your mother was being raped?

477
00:25:18,732 --> 00:25:20,699
Would you kill then?

478
00:25:20,701 --> 00:25:24,036
If my mother was being
raped? Yes, well, fuck yeah.

479
00:25:24,038 --> 00:25:26,005
Yeah, but under those
circumstances, anybody would.

480
00:25:26,007 --> 00:25:27,271
Okay, so then change the circumstances...

481
00:25:27,273 --> 00:25:28,673
and you'll cross that line...

482
00:25:28,675 --> 00:25:31,710
the line you said you wouldn't cross.

483
00:25:31,712 --> 00:25:35,114
So by shifting your perspective
you can justify anything.

484
00:25:35,116 --> 00:25:37,682
Justify, that implies right and wrong.

485
00:25:37,684 --> 00:25:39,884
But if you reconcile your perspective...

486
00:25:39,886 --> 00:25:43,023
then right and wrong become relative.

487
00:25:44,825 --> 00:25:49,228
Chateau la fete Rothschild,
1959 finest Bordeaux.

488
00:25:49,230 --> 00:25:50,429
Hey, yo, we didn't order that.

489
00:25:50,431 --> 00:25:54,700
This is complements of Chef
Puck's closest friend, sir.

490
00:25:54,702 --> 00:25:57,435
Dean. Excuse me, boys.

491
00:25:57,437 --> 00:26:00,038
He asks that you go alone.

492
00:26:00,040 --> 00:26:02,176
That's okay, come on, Dean.

493
00:26:04,979 --> 00:26:07,179
I think he's awful.
You think he's talented?

494
00:26:07,181 --> 00:26:08,313
Yes, I do.

495
00:26:08,315 --> 00:26:09,714
Oh my God, his art is...

496
00:26:09,716 --> 00:26:11,016
Graffiti, first of all, looks bourgeois.

497
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:12,116
No, it doesn't.

498
00:26:12,118 --> 00:26:12,984
And all of his art looks
like it's finger painting.

499
00:26:12,986 --> 00:26:14,952
I love finger painting, it's so mature.

500
00:26:14,954 --> 00:26:16,721
Oh, that's why everyone
thinks he's a genius.

501
00:26:16,723 --> 00:26:17,990
Because you love him,
and you say it publicly.

502
00:26:17,992 --> 00:26:19,057
WARHOL: So?

503
00:26:19,059 --> 00:26:20,858
But I'm telling you this,
no one is gonna remember...

504
00:26:20,860 --> 00:26:22,827
Jean-Michel Basket...

505
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:24,096
Basquiat.

506
00:26:24,098 --> 00:26:26,030
Basquiat... in like, 15
minutes. Forget about it.

507
00:26:26,032 --> 00:26:28,067
- Oh, Joe, hello.
- Mr. Levin.

508
00:26:28,069 --> 00:26:31,336
You came to say hi, and
you brought Dean anyway.

509
00:26:31,338 --> 00:26:33,838
Mr. Levin, I want to say
thank you for the wine.

510
00:26:33,840 --> 00:26:35,473
And but of course I had to
bring my partner with me.

511
00:26:35,475 --> 00:26:37,209
Well, I guess I'll have to respect that.

512
00:26:37,211 --> 00:26:39,411
But if you don't call me Ron,
I might have to murder you.

513
00:26:39,413 --> 00:26:43,281
And this is my friend, Andy. Andy, Joe.

514
00:26:43,283 --> 00:26:44,883
It is a pleasure to meet you.

515
00:26:44,885 --> 00:26:46,484
WARHOL: Nice to meet you.

516
00:26:46,486 --> 00:26:49,721
Andy is in town doing, are you ready?

517
00:26:49,723 --> 00:26:53,192
An episode of The Love
Boat, with Milton Berle.

518
00:26:53,194 --> 00:26:55,827
Oh, and apparently Milton
Berle has a Love Boat...

519
00:26:55,829 --> 00:26:58,262

So you know, Ron.

527
00:27:17,117 --> 00:27:19,984

percent in three weeks.

you took a horrible beating...

We really should get together
and talk about you investing.

You see I knew it the

You're a hustler, just like me.

537
00:27:42,909 --> 00:27:44,910
Thank you so much for coming to say hi.

538
00:27:44,912 --> 00:27:47,445
You will excuse us, won't you, Joe?

539
00:27:47,447 --> 00:27:48,547
Of course, of course.

540
00:27:48,549 --> 00:27:55,319
Joe, this is for you. Sugar,

Hey, can we have a word real quick?

We have an investment company.

558
00:28:56,383 --> 00:28:59,317
And I was just talking to Andy Warhol.

559
00:28:59,319 --> 00:29:02,453
Do you know Andy Warhol,
have you heard of him?

560
00:29:02,455 --> 00:29:03,355
Come see me!

561
00:29:03,357 --> 00:29:06,024
Obviously yeah, you have heard of him.

562
00:29:06,026 --> 00:29:07,159
Yeah.

But, I'm you know, trying

564
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,230
But I don't know anything about the scene.

565
00:29:12,232 --> 00:29:14,232
It looks like you are getting
to know the scene pretty well.

566
00:29:14,234 --> 00:29:15,433
No, the art scene.

567
00:29:15,435 --> 00:29:18,569
I don't know the first thing about it.

568
00:29:18,571 --> 00:29:24,076
So, I was thinking,
maybe you could tutor me?

569
00:29:24,078 --> 00:29:25,243
Tutor you?

570
00:29:25,245 --> 00:29:27,246
You know, give me a crash course in art.

571
00:29:27,248 --> 00:29:28,413
I don't know anything about it.

572
00:29:28,415 --> 00:29:32,584
I got this for you.

573
00:29:32,586 --> 00:29:38,026

574
00:29:39,193 --> 00:29:40,595

I had been working at Rothchild for a year.

640
00:33:00,694 --> 00:33:03,295
When suddenly I found
myself thrown in front...

641
00:33:03,297 --> 00:33:06,298
of a discipline committee and
was forced to defend myself.

642
00:33:06,300 --> 00:33:09,601
And I had nothing.

00:33:09,603 --> 00:33:13,838

them good, so I came clean.

They take your license?

00:33:16,276 --> 00:33:18,175
No, I mean they could have,
they should have, but no.

646
00:33:18,177 --> 00:33:21,179
Because what I was doing
wasn't illegal... yet.

647
00:33:21,181 --> 00:33:26,484
I was ahead of the law. I mean,
it was unethical and corrupt.

648
00:33:26,486 --> 00:33:28,487
Immoral if you believe
in that sort of thing.

649
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:32,257
But it wasn't illegal, so they had nothing.

650
00:33:32,259 --> 00:33:35,160
So guess what they did.

651
00:33:35,162 --> 00:33:39,364
They asked me to write the code...

652
00:33:39,366 --> 00:33:43,401

trading that I had been doing.

653
00:33:43,403 --> 00:33:46,137
How brilliant is that?

654
00:33:46,139 --> 00:33:50,342

Kind of sounds too good to be true.

694
00:35:23,002 --> 00:35:25,270
It looks true to me.

695
00:35:25,272 --> 00:35:26,638
DEAN (V.O.): <i>We pulled in everyone.</i>

696
00:35:26,640 --> 00:35:29,908
<i>BBC was no longer our game.
It belonged to all of us.</i>

697
00:35:29,910 --> 00:35:32,910
<i>It was a family, which
was the secret to the BBC.</i>

698
00:35:32,912 --> 00:35:34,145
- I'm in.
- All right.

699
00:35:34,147 --> 00:35:35,379
DEAN (V.O.): <i>We wanted
members with friends...</i>

700
00:35:35,381 --> 00:35:37,314
<i>and families who were
titans of the west coast.</i>

701
00:35:37,316 --> 00:35:38,485
I'm in.

702
00:35:40,953 --> 00:35:42,390
I'm in.

703
00:35:44,258 --> 00:35:48,259
- I'm in.
- How much?

704
00:35:48,261 --> 00:35:51,595
Call.

705
00:35:51,597 --> 00:35:52,930
Boys!

706
00:35:52,932 --> 00:35:54,935
Come on, guys. Come on.

707
00:35:56,903 --> 00:35:58,169
Gentlemen...

708
00:35:58,171 --> 00:36:00,272
DEAN (V.O.): <i>But Ron didn't
trust outside brokers.</i>

709
00:36:00,274 --> 00:36:02,439
<i>Insisted on using his own.</i>

710
00:36:02,441 --> 00:36:03,475
RECEPTIONIST (OVER SPEAKER): <i>Good
morning, Morgan Brokerage.</i>

711
00:36:03,477 --> 00:36:04,575
<i>How may I help you?</i>

712
00:36:04,577 --> 00:36:05,977
Hello, Frank Piedmont please.

713
00:36:05,979 --> 00:36:06,914
RECEPTIONIST (OVER
SPEAKER): <i>One moment.</i>

714
00:36:08,515 --> 00:36:09,613
FRANK (OVER SPEAKER):
<i>Frank Piedmont.</i>

715
00:36:09,615 --> 00:36:11,783
Hello, Frank, I'm here with Joe Hunt.

716
00:36:11,785 --> 00:36:13,951
FRANK (OVER SPEAKER):
<i>Hey, Ron, hey, Joe.</i>

717
00:36:13,953 --> 00:36:15,620
Good afternoon, Mr. Piedmont.

718
00:36:15,622 --> 00:36:17,721
Ron has told me about your
unique trading system...

719
00:36:17,723 --> 00:36:19,790
in the gold commodities market.

720
00:36:19,792 --> 00:36:21,660
I'm impressed. That's not easy to do.

721
00:36:21,662 --> 00:36:24,462
Most people lose their shirts
if they stay in gold too long.

722
00:36:24,464 --> 00:36:25,629
I'm sorry to be so direct...

723
00:36:25,631 --> 00:36:28,269
but I would like to check
the balance in the account.

724
00:36:39,345 --> 00:36:42,413
Frank, do you mind
saying that one more time?

725
00:36:42,415 --> 00:36:44,082
FRANK (OVER SPEAKER): <i>At closing
market today, the account...</i>

726
00:36:44,084 --> 00:36:46,383
<i>balance was four million,
one hundred thousand...</i>

727
00:36:46,385 --> 00:36:48,288
<i>two dollars and five cents.</i>

728
00:36:53,894 --> 00:36:54,926
Thank you, Frank.

729
00:36:54,928 --> 00:36:58,331
Joe will be back in
touch very soon, I'm sure.

730
00:37:00,334 --> 00:37:02,633
Remember the butterflies
in your gut right now.

731
00:37:02,635 --> 00:37:06,805
And know that is the show.

732
00:37:06,807 --> 00:37:08,807
You sell a BMW, you pay your rent.

733
00:37:08,809 --> 00:37:10,741
You refine a tanker full of crude...

734
00:37:10,743 --> 00:37:12,676
you cover your overhead for a year.

735
00:37:12,678 --> 00:37:16,448
But if you perform on the
account I just handed you...

736
00:37:16,450 --> 00:37:22,787
then your lives will never be the same.

737
00:37:22,789 --> 00:37:27,058
Think big and you will be big.

738
00:37:27,060 --> 00:37:29,727
Unless, of course, I got you boys wrong.

739
00:37:29,729 --> 00:37:34,499
I mean, after all, what
does the BBC stand for again?

740
00:37:34,501 --> 00:37:35,533
Oh right.

741
00:37:35,535 --> 00:37:38,602
Bitching Boring Crew?

742
00:37:38,604 --> 00:37:43,677
The Brainless Boneheaded Cartel?

743
00:37:46,513 --> 00:37:56,720
Or are you, the Billionaire Boys Club?

744
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:58,555
DEAN (V.O.): <i>One Ron said
think big, we took it to heart.</i>

745
00:37:58,557 --> 00:38:01,926
<i>From now on, every
check that came in...</i>

746
00:38:01,928 --> 00:38:03,595
<i>went towards more luxury.</i>

747
00:38:03,597 --> 00:38:06,633
<i>Which meant more loans.</i>

748
00:38:07,834 --> 00:38:09,100
Billionaire...

749
00:38:09,102 --> 00:38:10,671
Or bust.

750
00:38:12,138 --> 00:38:15,406
As one of our first
investors, Mr. Baxter...

751
00:38:15,408 --> 00:38:17,477
I wanted to come by personally
and deliver this check.

752
00:38:19,613 --> 00:38:23,747
50 percent return, just like we promised.

753
00:38:23,749 --> 00:38:27,785
I don't normally invest, but
I have to say that the BBC...

754
00:38:27,787 --> 00:38:31,423
has really struck a cord with me.

755
00:38:31,425 --> 00:38:33,792
Especially watching
young men like yourselves.

756
00:38:33,794 --> 00:38:37,729
I can only hope my sons
follow in your footsteps.

757
00:38:37,731 --> 00:38:43,500
Which is why I've decided.

758
00:38:43,502 --> 00:38:45,872
And invest it for them, in the BBC.

759
00:38:48,874 --> 00:38:50,875
Hell, I even took out a second mortgage.

760
00:38:50,877 --> 00:38:54,479
I'm hooked. I'm hooked.

761
00:38:54,481 --> 00:38:55,946
<i>You're probably
wondering why we take</i>

762
00:38:55,948 --> 00:38:59,750
<i>this money when we just got
four mil from Ron Levin.</i>

763
00:38:59,752 --> 00:39:02,654
<i>We weren't actually holding
Ron's money in our hands.</i>

764
00:39:02,656 --> 00:39:05,622
<i>We were just authorized to
trade that money on his behalf.</i>

765
00:39:05,624 --> 00:39:07,794
<i>We were paper rich, but cash poor.</i>

766
00:39:15,502 --> 00:39:17,634
Dean, look at this.

767
00:39:17,636 --> 00:39:20,238
That's his kid's college fund.

768
00:39:20,240 --> 00:39:23,174
That is the house that they live in.

769
00:39:23,176 --> 00:39:25,977
We can't keep promising
fifty percent returns.

770
00:39:25,979 --> 00:39:28,212
We are committing fraud.

771
00:39:28,214 --> 00:39:30,151
Should we give it back?

772
00:39:34,153 --> 00:39:39,823
Honestly, Joe, the only
difference between high risk...

773
00:39:39,825 --> 00:39:44,432
investing and a Ponzi
scheme, is how it all ends.

774
00:39:46,765 --> 00:39:50,738
That check is just one more
reason, to pull it all off.

775
00:39:54,841 --> 00:39:57,575
You know what beats a kids college fund?

776
00:39:57,577 --> 00:39:59,843
Four kids college funds.

777
00:39:59,845 --> 00:40:04,048
We are gonna make Baxter so much money...

778
00:40:04,050 --> 00:40:07,218
he pays off both his mortgages.

779
00:40:07,220 --> 00:40:09,156
And sends every kid to grad school.

780
00:40:17,897 --> 00:40:19,763
Hi, I'm meeting Burt Langdon.

781
00:40:19,765 --> 00:40:22,200
Oh, Mr. Langdon just called.

782
00:40:22,202 --> 00:40:24,134
He wanted me to tell you that
he had a family emergency...

783
00:40:24,136 --> 00:40:26,837
and that he will call you
tomorrow and he was very sorry.

784
00:40:26,839 --> 00:40:28,542
Oh, thanks.

785
00:40:37,249 --> 00:40:43,020
Okay, so who has got the big
schlong, is it Scott or Kyle?

786
00:40:43,022 --> 00:40:46,024
What? You are sleeping with both of them!

787
00:40:46,026 --> 00:40:48,091
No, but it is kind of a disaster.

788
00:40:48,093 --> 00:40:50,263
Something is very wrong with you guys.

789
00:40:53,732 --> 00:40:55,033
Are you following me?

790
00:40:55,035 --> 00:40:58,269
What? No, I had a meeting here.

791
00:40:58,271 --> 00:41:00,171
I think he is stalking you.

792
00:41:00,173 --> 00:41:03,042
No, I swear. You can ask the hostess.

793
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:07,245
We're kidding.

794
00:41:07,247 --> 00:41:08,680
I have to go meet Dean.

795
00:41:08,682 --> 00:41:10,247
No, you don't.

796
00:41:10,249 --> 00:41:11,950
Such a nightmare when your
girlfriends hate your boyfriend.

797
00:41:11,952 --> 00:41:13,151
Oh...

798
00:41:13,153 --> 00:41:16,955
Come on, I'll take you to
see Scotty boy or is it Kyle?

799
00:41:16,957 --> 00:41:18,923
Whoever is home.

800
00:41:18,925 --> 00:41:20,258
- Love you, babes.
- Bye.

801
00:41:20,260 --> 00:41:22,263
- See you tonight at the gallery.
- Bye.

802
00:41:26,365 --> 00:41:29,866
So, do you not like Dean for Q?

803
00:41:29,868 --> 00:41:31,868
Or do you just not like Dean at all?

804
00:41:31,870 --> 00:41:33,604
I am not a fan of Mean Dean.

805
00:41:33,606 --> 00:41:34,705
Mean Dean?

806
00:41:34,707 --> 00:41:36,707
Why does everyone call him that?

807
00:41:36,709 --> 00:41:38,776
You don't know?

808
00:41:38,778 --> 00:41:41,178
In third grade he burned down
the game room at Camp Tawonga...

809
00:41:41,180 --> 00:41:42,980
and blamed my cousin Jake for it.

810
00:41:42,982 --> 00:41:44,948
Jake got sent home for the entire summer...

811
00:41:44,950 --> 00:41:47,785
and Dean won the camp tennis championship.

812
00:41:47,787 --> 00:41:49,220
That's not a coincidence.

813
00:41:49,222 --> 00:41:51,888
You are talking about third grade.

814
00:41:51,890 --> 00:41:53,890
A leopard doesn't change its spots.

815
00:41:53,892 --> 00:41:55,627
Acutally a leopard does change its spots...

816
00:41:55,629 --> 00:41:58,930
according to Scientific American.

817
00:41:58,932 --> 00:42:00,932
Are you always this ahh, literal?

818
00:42:00,934 --> 00:42:02,700
Oh yeah, always.

819
00:42:02,702 --> 00:42:07,270
Do you want some?

820
00:42:07,272 --> 00:42:08,272
No thanks.

821
00:42:08,274 --> 00:42:09,807
I'm good.

822
00:42:09,809 --> 00:42:12,343
Do you not drink?

823
00:42:12,345 --> 00:42:14,281
I've actually never had a sip.

824
00:42:16,115 --> 00:42:17,115
Tell me more.

825
00:42:17,117 --> 00:42:19,816
What do you want to know?

826
00:42:19,818 --> 00:42:20,951
Everything.

827
00:42:20,953 --> 00:42:23,854
Wow, okay.

828
00:42:23,856 --> 00:42:25,423
Yeah, I'm from the Valley.

829
00:42:25,425 --> 00:42:29,127
I went to Harvard School for
Boys on a full scholarship.

830
00:42:29,129 --> 00:42:31,194
My mom left when I was 15.

831
00:42:31,196 --> 00:42:34,866
So I choose to stay with
my dad. Okay, your turn.

832
00:42:34,868 --> 00:42:37,769
I grew up in Beverly Hills.

833
00:42:37,771 --> 00:42:40,904
I went to an all-girls high school.

834
00:42:40,906 --> 00:42:44,676
My parents are still together,
happily if there's such a thing.

835
00:42:44,678 --> 00:42:46,778
Have you always wanted to be an artist?

836
00:42:46,780 --> 00:42:48,779
Always is a strong word, but yeah.

837
00:42:48,781 --> 00:42:51,082
Yeah, I guess so.

838
00:42:51,084 --> 00:42:54,084
Cool. And you said you had a show tonight?

839
00:42:54,086 --> 00:42:55,386
Not me, my boss.

840
00:42:55,388 --> 00:42:59,122
JOE: Oh, is his stuff any good?

841
00:42:59,124 --> 00:43:01,959
I'll let you be the judge.

842
00:43:01,961 --> 00:43:03,830
Was that an invitation?

843
00:43:12,071 --> 00:43:15,973
Hey, Dad.

844
00:43:15,975 --> 00:43:18,109
Where did you get all the fancy clothes?

845
00:43:18,111 --> 00:43:21,446
At Armani, they're nice, right?

846
00:43:21,448 --> 00:43:23,714
With the way things are going...

847
00:43:23,716 --> 00:43:25,917
we're not gonna have to worry
about anything ever again.

848
00:43:25,919 --> 00:43:28,218
- I'm gonna set you up.
- You're gonna set me up?

849
00:43:28,220 --> 00:43:29,220
Yeah.

850
00:43:29,222 --> 00:43:30,187
BBC is really taking off.

851
00:43:30,189 --> 00:43:34,091
I'm going to get you out of this shit hole.

852
00:43:34,093 --> 00:43:36,227
I thought that the one good
thing I did in my life was to

853
00:43:36,229 --> 00:43:37,861
get you an quality education.

854
00:43:37,863 --> 00:43:39,863
So you can have a better life than me.

855
00:43:39,865 --> 00:43:41,866
But had I known that you were
going to emulate these people

856
00:43:41,868 --> 00:43:45,502
that think they are better than us.

857
00:43:45,504 --> 00:43:48,071
Joe, it's my experience
that if you are honest

858
00:43:48,073 --> 00:43:49,741
in business, things don't happen this fast.

859
00:43:49,743 --> 00:43:51,412
You worry too much.

860
00:43:54,214 --> 00:43:57,451
<i>(MUSIC PLAYING)</i>

861
00:44:01,521 --> 00:44:05,758
Dude, this suit is lethal.

862
00:44:09,129 --> 00:44:13,531
Joe, gold was down 15 percent at the bell.

863
00:44:13,533 --> 00:44:15,301
It'll correct.

864
00:44:17,102 --> 00:44:19,236
What do you mean the installers broke it!

865
00:44:19,238 --> 00:44:21,939
- I'm sorry...
- Just get out of my sight!

866
00:44:21,941 --> 00:44:23,343
Now!

867
00:44:55,508 --> 00:44:58,308
You look beautiful.

868
00:44:58,310 --> 00:44:59,912
Hardly.

869
00:45:02,948 --> 00:45:04,885
Nice suit.

870
00:45:07,153 --> 00:45:08,886
Look, if you ever want
to be taken seriously...

871
00:45:08,888 --> 00:45:11,589

872

Whoa, whoa, whoa, Sydney.

873
00:45:13,359 --> 00:45:16,227

let this guy bring you down?

874

This guy?

875

Look at his glasses.

876
00:45:18,531 --> 00:45:20,531
He looks like Clark Kent on Quaaludes.

877
00:45:20,533 --> 00:45:24,334
They are very fashionable glasses.

878
00:45:24,336 --> 00:45:27,138
Seriously, Sydney.

879
00:45:27,140 --> 00:45:30,174
How many people would be here

880
00:45:30,176 --> 00:45:35,212
How many of these ideas, did he run by you?

881
00:45:35,214 --> 00:45:37,216
He's lucky to have you.

882
00:45:39,051 --> 00:45:40,386
So lucky...

883

This is our ticket to

897

It was originally built
for gold, but Joe thinks...

898
00:47:14,379 --> 00:47:16,948
we make a fortune using
it in the energy sector.

899
00:47:16,950 --> 00:47:20,350
So there's a company in
Chicago, it's called Cogenco.

900
00:47:20,352 --> 00:47:22,386
They turn oil-burning furnaces into coal.

901
00:47:22,388 --> 00:47:24,020
But they are in Chapter 11...

902
00:47:24,022 --> 00:47:26,457
because they still haven't
figured out how to grind it.

903
00:47:26,459 --> 00:47:30,127
So you want to use a gold mill for coal?

904
00:47:30,129 --> 00:47:34,332
This deal, is worth a quarter
of a billion dollars...

905
00:47:34,334 --> 00:47:36,466
in the first three years.

906
00:47:36,468 --> 00:47:39,303
And we are using your money to buy it.

907
00:47:39,305 --> 00:47:41,604
Told ya, Ron, Joe is a genius.

908
00:47:41,606 --> 00:47:42,805
Yeah, I know you told me, Dean.

909
00:47:42,807 --> 00:47:45,109
But it is a forgone conclusion
that everything you say...

910
00:47:45,111 --> 00:47:46,613
is completely full of shit.

911
00:47:52,618 --> 00:47:54,384
Is that the bouncer?

912
00:47:54,386 --> 00:47:56,220
That is my new bodyguard.

913
00:47:56,222 --> 00:47:57,520
Why do you need a bodyguard?

914
00:47:57,522 --> 00:47:59,689
Exactly what we want each share-holder

915
00:47:59,691 --> 00:48:01,359
to wonder when we walk in.

916
00:48:01,361 --> 00:48:03,026
Tim, it's good to see you!

917
00:48:03,028 --> 00:48:04,330
Good to be seen.

918
00:48:06,298 --> 00:48:09,500
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Cogenco had
big debts, $3 million worth.</i>

919
00:48:09,502 --> 00:48:12,703
<i>We agreed to pay them off using
Ron's money and in exchange</i>

920
00:48:12,705 --> 00:48:15,673
<i>the board agreed to sell us
the company and merge it.</i>

<i>...convince the shareholders.</i>

924
00:48:20,747 --> 00:48:26,783
I stand before you today with a proposal.

925
00:48:26,785 --> 00:48:28,586
So what's the question?

926
00:48:28,588 --> 00:48:33,390
The 1,000-pound elephant in this room...

927
00:48:33,392 --> 00:48:36,493
is 'how old are these
boys?' Well let me tell ya.

928
00:48:36,495 --> 00:48:39,029
I'm 24.

929
00:48:39,031 --> 00:48:41,564
My Chief Operating Officer, Dean Karny.

930
00:48:41,566 --> 00:48:43,299
He's 25.

931
00:48:43,301 --> 00:48:47,238
In fact, there isn't a single
member of BBC Consolidated...

932
00:48:47,240 --> 00:48:50,473
that's over the age of 30.

933
00:48:50,475 --> 00:48:52,075
And that should scare you.

934
00:48:52,077 --> 00:48:54,678
You're damn right it does.

935
00:48:54,680 --> 00:49:00,683
Because you have no clue how
we solved in a matter of months

936
00:49:00,685 --> 00:49:06,524
what 10 years of R&D has
landed you $3 million in debt

937
00:49:06,526 --> 00:49:09,459
and one vote away from bankruptcy.

938
00:49:09,461 --> 00:49:12,129
Inaction right now will render you extinct!

939
00:49:12,131 --> 00:49:18,071
But guts right now will make you rich!

The choice is yours.

941

DEAN (V.O.): <i>Three hours after
walking into that room...</i>

942
00:49:27,146 --> 00:49:29,479
<i>we left with a deal
for two corporations...</i>

943
00:49:29,481 --> 00:49:31,515
<i>twelve million in stock options...</i>

944
00:49:31,517 --> 00:49:34,819
<i>and patents worth a

<i>Fuck Google. Fuck
Facebook. Fuck them all!</i>

00:49:38,156 --> 00:49:40,424
<i>We were the first.</i>

947
00:49:40,426 --> 00:49:43,461
This house was inspired by Richard Myren.

948
00:49:43,463 --> 00:49:45,229
Three bedrooms, two baths.

949
00:49:45,231 --> 00:49:48,866
It can be rented unfurnished
or fully furnished...

950
00:49:48,868 --> 00:49:50,537
that's up to you.

951
00:49:55,607 --> 00:49:58,375
What are we doing here?

952
00:49:58,377 --> 00:49:59,613
What do you think, Dean?

953
00:50:05,151 --> 00:50:06,883
We owe disbursements to everyone...

954
00:50:06,885 --> 00:50:08,785
and no one is reinvesting.

955
00:50:08,787 --> 00:50:09,921
How can we afford this place?

956
00:50:09,923 --> 00:50:13,457
Ron is wiring us our half
of the profits next week.

957
00:50:13,459 --> 00:50:18,464
Then we own Congenco and
a deal worth $250 million.

958
00:50:21,868 --> 00:50:23,437
Wow.

959
00:50:26,472 --> 00:50:28,471

you wanted to get me...

960
00:50:28,473 --> 00:50:31,274

961
00:50:31,276 --> 00:50:33,213
Yeah.

962
00:50:36,682 --> 00:50:39,852

A couple of turntables by the jacuzzi.

1042
00:55:00,044 --> 00:55:01,178
He means Minister to the Shah...

1043
00:55:01,180 --> 00:55:04,080
Joe, Joe, what you have
here at the BBC is stunning.

1044
00:55:04,082 --> 00:55:09,019
It's so good. It's like
a fucking family, man!

1045
00:55:09,021 --> 00:55:10,821
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Izzy
was Charlie's friend.</i>

1046
00:55:10,823 --> 00:55:12,855
<i>They met one summer in Greece.</i>

1047
00:55:12,857 --> 00:55:15,691
<i>Like most Beverly Hills kids,
Izzy hated his father...</i>

1048
00:55:15,693 --> 00:55:16,826
<i>but he had good reason.</i>

1049
00:55:16,828 --> 00:55:20,997
<i>His dad was literally
a world-class asshole.</i>

1050
00:55:20,999 --> 00:55:22,866
<i>He was wanted by
Iranian Intelligence...</i>

1051
00:55:22,868 --> 00:55:24,767
<i>and was on the FBI watch list.</i>

1052
00:55:24,769 --> 00:55:26,937
- Okay, time to go home.
- Okay, okay.

1053
00:55:26,939 --> 00:55:28,971
Somebody put this guy in a cab.

1054
00:55:28,973 --> 00:55:30,577
Bye. Bye, Charlie.

1055
00:55:31,676 --> 00:55:33,576
Bye!

1056
00:55:33,578 --> 00:55:35,678
In you go, Izzy.

1057
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,649
Joe, I'm serious, I want to join the BBC.

1058
00:55:38,651 --> 00:55:41,451
Come to San Francisco and meet my father.

1059
00:55:41,453 --> 00:55:43,086
He's a very wealthy man.

1060
00:55:43,088 --> 00:55:45,024
Okay, Izzy, we'll talk soon.

1061
00:55:55,767 --> 00:55:59,035
Can't believe you're
leaving me at Christmas.

1062
00:55:59,037 --> 00:56:01,037
What's London got that I don't got?

1063
00:56:01,039 --> 00:56:02,441
Hmm?

1064
00:56:04,209 --> 00:56:05,878
Snow.

1065
00:56:08,247 --> 00:56:12,115
Oh, there's plenty of that here. Huh?

1066
00:56:12,117 --> 00:56:14,521
There we go.

1067
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:19,823
You're such an idiot.

1068
00:56:19,825 --> 00:56:24,928
I am a charming handsome lovely
idiot that you cannot resist.

1069
00:56:24,930 --> 00:56:26,696
You know that's empty right?

1070
00:56:26,698 --> 00:56:28,801
No...

1071
00:56:32,203 --> 00:56:35,707
Go on then. Go home.

1072
00:56:45,184 --> 00:56:47,854
Uh-uh-uh...
patience.

1073
00:56:53,926 --> 00:56:57,995
Now, have you been a good boy this year?

1074
00:56:57,997 --> 00:57:00,897
Yeah, very.

1075
00:57:00,899 --> 00:57:03,633
I find that hard to believe.

1076
00:57:03,635 --> 00:57:05,137
I know.

1077
00:57:09,207 --> 00:57:13,245
Hey, I love you, too.

1078
00:57:24,222 --> 00:57:29,158
Whoa. What is that?

1079
00:57:29,160 --> 00:57:31,328
Nineteen sixty two, Derringer four barrel.

1080
00:57:31,330 --> 00:57:34,798
I found it at the Costa Mesa
gun show for two hundred bucks.

1081
00:57:34,800 --> 00:57:38,569
Restored, thing's worth ten grand.

1082
00:57:38,571 --> 00:57:41,941
See, Dean? Even my body
guard is an entrepreneur.

1083
00:57:46,578 --> 00:57:48,548
Ryan, get me Frank Piedmont.

1084
00:57:50,582 --> 00:57:51,714
FRANK (OVER SPEAKER): <i>Hello?</i>

1085
00:57:51,716 --> 00:57:54,350
Hey Frank, it is Joe Hunt.

1086
00:57:54,352 --> 00:57:57,254
Just calling about that
final disbursement check.

1087
00:57:57,256 --> 00:57:59,355
Ron's bank in New York still
hasn't received it from you.

1088
00:57:59,357 --> 00:58:00,756
Disbursement?

1089
00:58:00,758 --> 00:58:02,658
You did send it, right?

1090
00:58:02,660 --> 00:58:04,664
Okay, wait. Is this a part of the story?

1091
00:58:11,069 --> 00:58:12,269
What story?

1092
00:58:12,271 --> 00:58:14,738
The story, Joe.

1093
00:58:14,740 --> 00:58:16,772
Joe, what's he talking about?

1094
00:58:16,774 --> 00:58:19,075
What story, Frank?

1095
00:58:19,077 --> 00:58:21,580
FRANK (OVER SPEAKER): <i>Are
you messing with me?</i>

1096
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:24,881
Does it sound like I'm messing with you?

1097
00:58:24,883 --> 00:58:28,919
Joe, listen, Ron told me he was
a producer for network news...

1098
00:58:28,921 --> 00:58:31,154
doing an expose on your gold system.

1099
00:58:31,156 --> 00:58:35,225
He got me to issue
statements on a phony account.

1100
00:58:35,227 --> 00:58:37,861
DEAN (V.O.): <i>And that's
the day bombs dropped.</i>

1101
00:58:37,863 --> 00:58:39,261
Phony?

1102
00:58:39,263 --> 00:58:41,698
Yeah, the money was not even real.

1103
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:43,265
Phony? What's phony?

1104
00:58:43,267 --> 00:58:44,968
It was all part of the story.

1105
00:58:44,970 --> 00:58:47,136
He had a camera crew in my office...

1106
00:58:47,138 --> 00:58:49,138
filming me during our first call.

1107
00:58:49,140 --> 00:58:50,973
What do you think?

1108
00:58:50,975 --> 00:58:53,377
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Turns out Frank
wasn't Ron's broker at all.</i>

1109
00:58:53,379 --> 00:58:55,645
<i>He thought Ron was a
network news reporter...</i>

1110
00:58:55,647 --> 00:58:58,247
<i>doing a story on investing.</i>

1111
00:58:58,249 --> 00:59:01,218
I'm the only one who knew there
is no money in that account.

1112
00:59:01,220 --> 00:59:03,986
Stay on the line, Joe.

1113
00:59:03,988 --> 00:59:05,921
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Ron conned him
into pretending the account...</i>

1114
00:59:05,923 --> 00:59:09,058
<i>was real, so that he could use
it to get a $1.5 million...</i>

1115
00:59:09,060 --> 00:59:11,361
<i>bank loan from somebody else.</i>

1116
00:59:11,363 --> 00:59:13,964
14.4 million in cash?

1117
00:59:13,966 --> 00:59:17,366
In an account at Thorton Brokerage?

1118
00:59:17,368 --> 00:59:19,368
How long will the approval take?

1119
00:59:19,370 --> 00:59:20,973
Won't take long at all.

1120
00:59:29,247 --> 00:59:30,381
Joe?

1121
00:59:30,383 --> 00:59:32,214
DEAN (V.O.): <i>Ron was
big time, all right.</i>

1122
00:59:32,216 --> 00:59:35,185
<i>Big time con man.</i>

1123
00:59:35,187 --> 00:59:40,790
But if you perform on the
account I just handed you.

1124
00:59:40,792 --> 00:59:42,792
I invest in relationships.

1125
00:59:42,794 --> 00:59:44,294
People not stock.

1126
00:59:44,296 --> 00:59:45,995
Joe, I'm from Wall Street.

1127
00:59:45,997 --> 00:59:48,400
Do you think people really
get rich playing by the rules?

1128
00:59:52,805 --> 00:59:54,073
SYDNEY: Joe!

1129
00:59:56,207 --> 01:00:00,444
You're never gonna believe
what happened today!

1130
01:00:00,446 --> 01:00:03,383
Joe, my pieces are gonna be in a show.

1131
01:00:06,785 --> 01:00:07,917
What's wrong?

1132
01:00:07,919 --> 01:00:09,486
Ron Levin burnt me down, Syd.

1133
01:00:09,488 --> 01:00:11,321
What?

1134
01:00:11,323 --> 01:00:14,223
There wasn't ever any money in the account.

1135
01:00:14,225 --> 01:00:16,292
Why would he do that?

1136
01:00:16,294 --> 01:00:18,296
Because, he's a hustler.

1137
01:00:23,468 --> 01:00:25,303
Just like me.

1138
01:00:27,238 --> 01:00:29,071
Look at this.

1139
01:00:29,073 --> 01:00:31,908
Tim has a friend at the LAPD.

1140
01:00:31,910 --> 01:00:34,444
Ron is under Federal
indictment in three states.

1141
01:00:34,446 --> 01:00:41,051
For bank violations, larceny,
check kiting, and postal fraud.

1142
01:00:41,053 --> 01:00:42,953
Postal fraud!

1143
01:00:42,955 --> 01:00:44,988
I am such an idiot!

1144
01:00:44,990 --> 01:00:47,256
You know how much money I put
into Congenco at this point!

1145
01:00:47,258 --> 01:00:49,258
Everything! And now it's fucked!

1146
01:00:49,260 --> 01:00:52,863
I am such a fucking idiot!
Fucker! An idiot! Mother fucker!

1147
01:00:52,865 --> 01:00:54,363
Joe, Joe, stop, stop, you're
gonna hurt yourself. Stop!

1148
01:00:54,365 --> 01:00:57,299
Sydney, look around! Look
at this house, and the car!

1149
01:00:57,301 --> 01:00:59,836
And my office! Is all
gone without Ron's money!

1150
01:00:59,838 --> 01:01:01,404
I'm fucked!

1151
01:01:01,406 --> 01:01:04,377
Okay, just calm down.

1152
01:01:11,216 --> 01:01:15,185
I don't understand. He gave me a Rolex.

1153
01:01:15,187 --> 01:01:18,223
It's the nicest gift
anyone's ever given me.

1154
01:01:20,959 --> 01:01:23,459
It's ticking.

1155
01:01:23,461 --> 01:01:25,731
The second hand on a Rolex sweeps.

1156
01:01:27,533 --> 01:01:29,935
It's a fake.

1157
01:01:32,571 --> 01:01:35,037
What if we just leave town for a while?

1158
01:01:35,039 --> 01:01:37,040
Just while this all blows over.

1159
01:01:37,042 --> 01:01:39,008
Syd, I can't just leave town.

1160
01:01:39,010 --> 01:01:41,444
I owe a lot of money to a lot of people.

1161
01:01:41,446 --> 01:01:44,446
Real people.

1162
01:01:44,448 --> 01:01:49,285
Retirement plans, and college funds.

1163
01:01:49,287 --> 01:01:52,524
I need to pay them back.

1164
01:02:04,403 --> 01:02:06,506
Beautiful. Okay.

1165
01:02:10,843 --> 01:02:12,308
Ron!

1166
01:02:12,310 --> 01:02:14,513
Oh, no, he's fine.

1167
01:02:16,314 --> 01:02:17,848
We need to talk.

1168
01:02:17,850 --> 01:02:20,015
Nicholas, meet my broker, Joe Hunt.

1169
01:02:20,017 --> 01:02:22,051
Spending some of our money, Joe?

1170
01:02:22,053 --> 01:02:23,319
Looks like a perfect fit.

1171
01:02:23,321 --> 01:02:25,321
Well, I wouldn't expect
anything but the best.

1172
01:02:25,323 --> 01:02:27,357
- Thank you, Nicholas.
- Thank you.

1173
01:02:27,359 --> 01:02:28,859
- Network news?
- Oh.

1174
01:02:28,861 --> 01:02:30,861
- You conned me.
- Ah, is that what you think?

1175
01:02:30,863 --> 01:02:33,095
Yes, a phony bank account
with no money in it.

1176
01:02:33,097 --> 01:02:34,564
An expose for sweeps week?

1177
01:02:34,566 --> 01:02:37,102
You have been playing me this whole time?

1178
01:02:40,171 --> 01:02:43,939
Did you ever believe in me?

1179
01:02:43,941 --> 01:02:46,878
Yes, and yes.

1180
01:02:49,013 --> 01:02:50,113
You know, Nicholas I don't think...

1181
01:02:50,115 --> 01:02:51,314
these are gonna fit in my trunk.

1182
01:02:51,316 --> 01:02:54,017
Why don't I come back next
week and try the smaller set.

1183
01:02:54,019 --> 01:02:56,352
Look, there is a perfect
explanation for all of this.

1184
01:02:56,354 --> 01:02:57,453
Okay, I'm all ears.

1185
01:02:57,455 --> 01:02:58,555
Excuse me, Mr. Levin?

1186
01:02:58,557 --> 01:03:00,892
Would you allow us to take
them outside and check?

1187
01:03:03,327 --> 01:03:05,263
Well, if you insist.

1188
01:03:07,932 --> 01:03:09,933
Oh shoot, I was right.

1189
01:03:09,935 --> 01:03:13,169
So close. Well, why don't we go ahead...

1190
01:03:13,171 --> 01:03:14,904
and try the smaller set
while we're out here.

1191
01:03:14,906 --> 01:03:16,506
Excellent idea, Mr. Levin.

1192
01:03:16,508 --> 01:03:19,508
Give us one moment, we'll
be right back. Thank you.

1193
01:03:19,510 --> 01:03:22,946
You can do anything in Beverly
Hills with a Rolex and a Rolls.

1194
01:03:22,948 --> 01:03:25,518
Fake Rolex, Ron?

1195
01:03:27,551 --> 01:03:29,586
Swing by the house, Joe.

1196
01:03:29,588 --> 01:03:31,354
I'll explain everything.

1197
01:03:31,356 --> 01:03:33,355
It's not nearly as sordid as you think.

1198
01:03:33,357 --> 01:03:37,294
Oh and Joe... do me a favor.

1199
01:03:37,296 --> 01:03:40,466
Tip Edwardo for me.

1200
01:03:44,169 --> 01:03:47,203
What do you mean, Ron's
burned us? Where is the money?

1201
01:03:47,205 --> 01:03:49,205
It was never there in the first place.

1202
01:03:49,207 --> 01:03:52,308
No, wait. What about the shares? Huh?

1203
01:03:52,310 --> 01:03:54,209
BBC's finished, Kyle.

1204
01:03:54,211 --> 01:03:56,345
You know, I can just see the
look on my old man's face now.

1205
01:03:56,347 --> 01:03:58,348
Yeah, no shit.

1206
01:03:58,350 --> 01:04:00,519
God, I just want to squash that bug.

1207
01:04:03,120 --> 01:04:05,057
Maybe we should.

1208
01:04:06,325 --> 01:04:08,261
Should what?

1209
01:04:10,261 --> 01:04:12,962
Fuck him up.

1210
01:04:12,964 --> 01:04:15,464
Well, he's con man. What's
he gonna do? Go to the cops?

1211
01:04:15,466 --> 01:04:18,037
Yeah, seriously.

1212
01:04:19,705 --> 01:04:21,705
What would you guys do alone
