1
00:01:10,003 --> 00:01:14,565
- Hey!
- I'm sorry, Miss Callum. No music.

2
00:01:14,641 --> 00:01:18,475
Isn't it one of the rules of the road -
the driver controls the radio?

3
00:01:18,545 --> 00:01:22,504
Not during her driver's test.

4
00:01:22,582 --> 00:01:25,608
Make a left.

5
00:01:27,821 --> 00:01:30,654
Perfect, huh?

6
00:01:31,825 --> 00:01:36,922
Wow. Has anybody ever told you
you have really amazing eyes?

7
00:01:36,996 --> 00:01:40,124
I'm not just saying that
to butter you up, it's true.

8
00:01:40,200 --> 00:01:44,227
You should think about wearing more
pastels - light blues, pale greens.

9
00:01:44,304 --> 00:01:49,264
They'd so bring out your eyes
and totally work for you.

10
00:01:49,342 --> 00:01:50,775
Oh!

11
00:01:50,844 --> 00:01:53,642
That's Daddy's factory.
Isn't it the cutest?

12
00:01:53,713 --> 00:01:56,375
Do you know him?
Reed Callum. He's the best.

13
00:01:58,284 --> 00:02:01,447
Absolutely not allowed!

14
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:04,456
But it's an emergency.
It's my sister. Please?

15
00:02:09,262 --> 00:02:10,889
Courtney?
Give me the deets.

16
00:02:10,964 --> 00:02:14,331
I found the most
perfect dress for my party.

17
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:17,335
- Only... promise you won't freak.
- Hmm?

18
00:02:17,403 --> 00:02:19,633
It's... orange.

19
00:02:19,706 --> 00:02:22,174
- Miss Callum!
- One second.

20
00:02:22,242 --> 00:02:24,972
If you do not get off the phone
and resume driving,

21
00:02:25,044 --> 00:02:27,274
you'll not get your driver's license.

22
00:02:29,983 --> 00:02:36,149
OK, ask her, is she sure the dress
isn't maybe, like, terra cotta or something.

23
00:02:36,222 --> 00:02:40,022
Pretty please? I gave you
that nice tip about pastels!

24
00:02:43,163 --> 00:02:45,063
Are you sure it isn't terra cotta?

25
00:02:47,267 --> 00:02:49,326
Yeah, I'm sure.

26
00:02:49,836 --> 00:02:52,771
- It's definitely orange.
- Uh...

27
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:57,242
Tell her she can get the dress
if I can wear her Jimmy Choos.

28
00:02:57,310 --> 00:03:02,043
Get the dress. But you have to
let her wear your gym shoes.

29
00:03:02,115 --> 00:03:04,481
Goodbye.

30
00:03:05,785 --> 00:03:08,652
Yes! Wrap it up.

31
00:03:08,721 --> 00:03:12,020
Aren't you at all
concerned about the price?

32
00:03:12,091 --> 00:03:14,059
Of course I am.
How much?

33
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,459
$1000.

34
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:19,896
Great! It's even sorta,
kinda within my budget.

35
00:03:19,966 --> 00:03:21,661
OK, then.

36
00:03:21,734 --> 00:03:25,192
Thing is, me and my sister
are best, best friends.

37
00:03:25,271 --> 00:03:29,298
Every year, we divide up colors,
favorite actors and fragrances,

38
00:03:29,375 --> 00:03:32,742
so there's nothing to fight about.
Isn't that smart?

39
00:03:32,812 --> 00:03:37,476
The reason I'm so cool about the orange
thing is because it's her cotillion, her night.

40
00:03:37,550 --> 00:03:40,417
She should completely have
whatever she wants.

41
00:03:40,486 --> 00:03:44,820
Oh, Mr. Reeves, if only you could have
been there for my party.

42
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:50,887
Of course, I didn't know you,
so I probably would have called security.

43
00:03:51,764 --> 00:03:54,096
Pull into the parking lot.

44
00:03:54,167 --> 00:04:00,572
I'm done? You're not even making me
do any yucky three-point turns?

45
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:04,201
Miss Callum, I take it you're
used to getting what you want.

46
00:04:04,277 --> 00:04:06,837
Well, yeah.

47
00:04:06,913 --> 00:04:10,906
The truth of the matter is, while you
handled the car quite competently,

48
00:04:10,984 --> 00:04:14,818
you seem to have
a very real problem staying focused.

49
00:04:14,887 --> 00:04:17,981
That's what Daddy says, too. Oh...

50
00:04:18,057 --> 00:04:22,255
But it's not something
you can flunk me for, right?

51
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:27,496
Sir, before you do anything rash,
let me just say this:

52
00:04:27,567 --> 00:04:31,003
If I don't pass today, I am gonna
be back here every possible second,

53
00:04:31,070 --> 00:04:34,130
requesting you and only you,
again and again...

54
00:04:34,207 --> 00:04:36,107
and again...

55
00:04:36,175 --> 00:04:38,735
for as totally long as it takes.

56
00:04:43,616 --> 00:04:45,914
On second thought... you pass.

57
00:04:47,086 --> 00:04:49,281
Thank you!

58
00:04:49,355 --> 00:04:51,915
Oh, sorry. Oh, sorry.

59
00:04:55,962 --> 00:04:58,726
I got you something.

60
00:04:58,798 --> 00:04:59,958
Oh, uh...

61
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:04,163
- How long we been in business, partner?
- 20 years ago today. Is that unreal?

62
00:05:04,237 --> 00:05:05,602
We've done good.

63
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:08,334
We'd do better
if you'd taken the Ketchem deal,

64
00:05:08,408 --> 00:05:12,674
but you're Mr. Slow and Steady
and I've learned to live with that.

65
00:05:12,745 --> 00:05:18,479
- Good. There's more to life than money.
- True, but look what money can buy.

66
00:05:18,551 --> 00:05:19,950
What's that?

67
00:05:20,019 --> 00:05:24,649
How long have you talked about trying
to make time to get back to your hobby?

68
00:05:24,724 --> 00:05:27,887
Since way before
the girls were born. Why?

69
00:05:27,960 --> 00:05:31,020
What photo would make
your collection complete?

70
00:05:31,097 --> 00:05:34,294
The gold-spotted skipper,
the most elusive butterfly of all.

71
00:05:34,367 --> 00:05:37,427
But one which can often be found
in the Ecuadorian rain forest

72
00:05:37,503 --> 00:05:41,837
at the end of the rainy season. Right?
Go ahead, open it.

73
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:44,103
What is this?

74
00:05:44,177 --> 00:05:46,236
What is...?

75
00:05:46,312 --> 00:05:48,837
Is this for real?
Are you...?

76
00:05:48,915 --> 00:05:50,780
No, wait, wait. l-l-I...

77
00:05:50,850 --> 00:05:53,842
I can't just up and leave, Bob.
This Monday?

78
00:05:53,920 --> 00:05:55,547
Yes, you can.

79
00:05:55,621 --> 00:05:58,055
Look, I'll handle things at work. Trust me.

80
00:05:58,124 --> 00:06:00,786
When the stars align,
you gotta go for it.

81
00:06:00,860 --> 00:06:03,624
No. Courtney's party -
I can't be gone for that.

82
00:06:03,696 --> 00:06:04,993
Sure you can.

83
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:06,463
You're the only guy I know

84
00:06:06,532 --> 00:06:11,697
who belongs to a country club he's never
been to. Courtney knows it's not your style.

85
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:16,401
Do you actually think she'll even notice
if you're not there? She's a teenage girl.

86
00:06:16,476 --> 00:06:20,071
"Daddy" is the last thing on her mind.

87
00:06:20,146 --> 00:06:21,340
Wow.

88
00:06:21,414 --> 00:06:24,850
- You did this for me?
- Who deserves it more, pal?

89
00:06:24,917 --> 00:06:27,852
What can I say? Thank you, Bob.
It's much appreciated.

90
00:06:27,920 --> 00:06:29,854
My pleasure.

91
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,820
What the heck?

92
00:06:38,898 --> 00:06:42,766
Hey, congratulations!

93
00:06:42,835 --> 00:06:44,598
What is this?

94
00:06:44,670 --> 00:06:47,730
Isn't it fabulous, Daddy?
Can you believe I passed?

95
00:06:47,807 --> 00:06:50,640
Where's Corrine?
I thought she drove you to the test.

96
00:06:50,710 --> 00:06:55,670
She did. We dropped her at the market.
Don't worry. We gave her cab fare.

97
00:06:55,748 --> 00:06:58,740
You expect her to take a taxi home
with all those groceries?

98
00:06:58,818 --> 00:07:00,547
Oh, no.

99
00:07:00,620 --> 00:07:03,783
I'm sorry.
I never thought about that part.

100
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:07,724
I was so excited to give you the good news.
Should I go back and get her?

101
00:07:07,794 --> 00:07:10,422
No. I'm sure she's probably
already on her way home.

102
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:14,227
I'm really sorry.
It won't ever happen again, I promise.

103
00:07:14,300 --> 00:07:18,100
- But isn't the sign adorable?
- They sell those at the DMV now?

104
00:07:18,171 --> 00:07:22,574
No, silly. She ordered it last week, just in
case. Custom-made and only 200 bucks!

105
00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:27,102
Courtney can have it for when she gets her
license. I used our frequent-shoppers card,

106
00:07:27,180 --> 00:07:33,312
which, with the 12% discount and the 4.95
cash rebate, means it only really cost...

107
00:07:34,220 --> 00:07:37,883
- $171.05
- Yeah, what she said!

108
00:07:37,957 --> 00:07:40,858
- A bargain.
- In their world, it is.

109
00:07:40,927 --> 00:07:44,124
OK, now...

110
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,324
Ready for this?

111
00:07:51,170 --> 00:07:53,866
You did not get me a car?

112
00:07:53,940 --> 00:07:57,376
For me? Really?

113
00:07:57,443 --> 00:07:59,604
- What is it?
- A genuine classic.

114
00:07:59,679 --> 00:08:02,443
Wait. Doesn't "classic" just mean old?

115
00:08:02,515 --> 00:08:04,983
- And used?
- Yeah?

116
00:08:12,658 --> 00:08:16,219
It's so cute. Oh!

117
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:19,594
It's exactly like the one
Mom's driving in the old pictures.

118
00:08:19,665 --> 00:08:24,227
It is your mother's old car. I had Ralph
down at the dairy return it to mint condition.

119
00:08:24,303 --> 00:08:26,703
Daddy, that's so hot
and totally special.

120
00:08:26,772 --> 00:08:29,366
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

121
00:08:29,442 --> 00:08:31,410
Let's take her for a cruise!

122
00:08:31,477 --> 00:08:34,378
Hang on there, hot shot.
This car's a stick shift.

123
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:36,381
A stick? Ew.

124
00:08:36,449 --> 00:08:38,713
So before you grind through the gears

125
00:08:38,784 --> 00:08:42,447
of a brand-new transmission,
I worked out a deal with a friend.

126
00:08:42,522 --> 00:08:47,186
He's gonna teach you on a vehicle
that's not quite so... delicate.

127
00:08:50,129 --> 00:08:54,498
Look, son, in all the years Reed Callum
has been our number one milk buyer,

128
00:08:54,567 --> 00:08:56,728
he's never once asked me for a favor.

129
00:08:56,802 --> 00:08:59,703
Exactly my point.
He didn't ask me, he asked you.

130
00:08:59,772 --> 00:09:03,572
You're the one's gonna
teach his daughter to drive a stick.

131
00:09:03,643 --> 00:09:06,544
That's not fair!
Why should I let her wreck my truck?

132
00:09:06,612 --> 00:09:09,172
Because I bought you that truck
to help me out,

133
00:09:09,248 --> 00:09:12,581
which is what you'll be doing
by keeping Mr. Callum happy.

134
00:09:12,652 --> 00:09:17,783
You don't understand, Dad. Taylor Callum
is a spoiled, stuck-up, condescending...

135
00:09:17,857 --> 00:09:22,226
Wow. "Condescending."
Big word for a farm boy.

136
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,991
Miss Callum.
We didn't know you were here.

137
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,001
Obviously.

138
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:34,005
- Please excuse my boy. He can be...
- Unkind? Judgmental?

139
00:09:34,073 --> 00:09:37,270
In desperate need of a long, hot shower?

140
00:09:37,343 --> 00:09:39,675
Here, hold her a second.

141
00:09:42,014 --> 00:09:44,039
Ew! Ugh!

142
00:09:44,116 --> 00:09:47,779
Why'd you do that? I was gonna
take her to get her inoculation.

143
00:09:47,853 --> 00:09:50,981
Excuse me, do I look like
a pig-holding kind of girl?

144
00:09:51,057 --> 00:09:55,960
Don't worry, Jackson. I'll deal with Nanette.
You start the driving lesson.

145
00:09:56,028 --> 00:09:57,222
Dad, come on.

146
00:10:00,066 --> 00:10:02,694
Let's go.

147
00:10:11,677 --> 00:10:15,374
I told you, first is up and to the left.
What's the problem?

148
00:10:15,448 --> 00:10:18,315
I'm trying, OK?
Quit hollering.

149
00:10:20,853 --> 00:10:24,914
Good. Now ease off the clutch
and give it some gas.

150
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:26,856
OK.

151
00:10:32,298 --> 00:10:35,199
Sorry. This is hopeless.

152
00:10:35,267 --> 00:10:37,929
Yeah, that's the trouble
with people like you.

153
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:39,471
People like me?

154
00:10:39,538 --> 00:10:44,237
Yeah. Rich, pampered chicks
that glide through life without a clue.

155
00:10:44,310 --> 00:10:49,748
Do you have any idea what it means
to actually work at something?

156
00:10:49,815 --> 00:10:51,214
You're mean.

157
00:10:54,820 --> 00:10:58,449
Look, can we just...
Can we just try this again?

158
00:11:00,760 --> 00:11:03,058
Start her up and put in the clutch.

159
00:11:12,071 --> 00:11:13,595
Wow! I did it.

160
00:11:13,673 --> 00:11:17,700
Hallelujah! Now ease off the clutch
and give it some gas.

161
00:11:26,419 --> 00:11:28,353
I've got it, Jackson!

162
00:11:28,421 --> 00:11:30,582
See what happens when you try?

163
00:11:41,100 --> 00:11:43,330
- Wait, stop the truck.
- What?

164
00:11:43,402 --> 00:11:45,563
- I need to check on Martha.
- Martha who?

165
00:11:45,638 --> 00:11:47,401
Stay here.

166
00:11:58,818 --> 00:12:00,718
- Is she sick?
- Pregnant.

167
00:12:00,786 --> 00:12:04,552
Due any day. I'm trying
to make sure everything's OK.

168
00:12:04,623 --> 00:12:07,592
Thought I told you to wait in the truck.

169
00:12:07,660 --> 00:12:09,855
You're not the boss of me.

170
00:12:09,929 --> 00:12:13,160
Did you at least put on
the parking brake?

171
00:12:19,171 --> 00:12:20,729
Oh, no!

172
00:12:20,806 --> 00:12:23,036
Stop, please!

173
00:12:27,813 --> 00:12:31,476
I can't believe...!
It's my truck!

174
00:12:40,025 --> 00:12:41,424
Wha...?

175
00:12:42,194 --> 00:12:46,153
Jackson... I'm so, so sorry.

176
00:12:47,800 --> 00:12:51,395
I killed your truck.
How could I do that?

177
00:12:53,072 --> 00:12:56,371
Look... I know it wasn't on purpose.

178
00:12:56,442 --> 00:13:01,937
But it's so horrible. I'm a terrible person.
But don't worry, though, OK?

179
00:13:02,014 --> 00:13:06,474
Daddy will totally pay to haul it out of there
and get it fixed.

180
00:13:08,554 --> 00:13:10,454
It's gonna cost me how much?

181
00:13:10,523 --> 00:13:13,390
800 for the recovery
and 2000 for the repairs?

182
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:18,761
But you can use my discount card.
Then it'll only be 2450 total.

183
00:13:18,831 --> 00:13:21,994
All because you didn't
set the parking brake?

184
00:13:22,067 --> 00:13:24,092
I'm sorry, Daddy, really.

185
00:13:24,170 --> 00:13:29,233
What can I say? It was all my fault.
But you're the one who made me go there!

186
00:13:29,308 --> 00:13:33,267
Jackson Meade is the last boy
I'd ever be hanging out with.

187
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:35,404
- He is kinda cute.
- Ya think?

188
00:13:35,481 --> 00:13:37,005
- Awesome smile.
- Good hair.

189
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,846
- Totally hot.
- Girls!

190
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:43,480
You both seem to think
I've got a money tree in the backyard.

191
00:13:43,556 --> 00:13:48,721
Your carelessness, your spending -
it's gotta stop.

192
00:13:51,030 --> 00:13:55,797
When you say the spending's gotta stop,
you don't mean <i>stop</i> stop, right?

193
00:13:55,868 --> 00:14:01,534
'Cause pulling back, we can definitely do,
but cut us off completely, we might die.

194
00:14:07,213 --> 00:14:09,238
I'm so glad you're doing this.

195
00:14:09,315 --> 00:14:12,842
Hasn't it been forever
since you've taken a real vacation?

196
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:14,783
Longer, I think.

197
00:14:14,854 --> 00:14:16,378
Hey, Court.

198
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,854
You're OK with me not being at your party?

199
00:14:19,925 --> 00:14:22,792
Totally. I know you think
the whole thing's silly.

200
00:14:22,862 --> 00:14:27,356
If you were there, I'd have to make you
dance with me... in front of everybody.

201
00:14:27,433 --> 00:14:29,799
Ew, yeah.
That wouldn't be so pretty.

202
00:14:29,869 --> 00:14:32,303
I pinky promise -
I've warned the other girls -

203
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:35,863
even though it won't be easy,
I'll stick to your budget.

204
00:14:35,941 --> 00:14:40,207
$ 25,000, not one single penny more!

205
00:14:40,279 --> 00:14:41,507
Deal.

206
00:14:51,023 --> 00:14:54,117
Darn it. I can navigate a computer
better than a bunch of geeks,

207
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:57,685
but I can't work this stupid can opener!

208
00:14:57,763 --> 00:15:00,926
- Um, Court?
- Yes.

209
00:15:01,000 --> 00:15:03,696
You might wanna try plugging it in.

210
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:06,633
Oh.

211
00:15:07,806 --> 00:15:12,300
Don't you hate Corrine's day off?

212
00:15:14,647 --> 00:15:17,844
Shoppers Anonymous.

213
00:15:17,917 --> 00:15:20,750
Hold on. She's right here. Heather.

214
00:15:26,258 --> 00:15:29,091
Where are you? For real?

215
00:15:29,161 --> 00:15:33,393
That is so amazing. Plus what?

216
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:36,400
No way!
OK, it's too good to be true.

217
00:15:36,468 --> 00:15:39,130
Do not move.
We're out the door.

218
00:15:39,204 --> 00:15:40,728
We've gotta go, now.

219
00:15:40,806 --> 00:15:45,436
Heather's at Tivanello's and she found
the perfect tangerine slides for my dress.

220
00:15:45,511 --> 00:15:47,103
- Plus...
- What?

221
00:15:47,179 --> 00:15:50,876
She says, just this second, they got in
two dozen pairs of the short boots

222
00:15:50,950 --> 00:15:53,646
you've combed the city for
in lavender and baby blue!

223
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:58,156
- Why are we still here?
- Grab your credit card. I'll get my phone.

224
00:16:04,229 --> 00:16:08,928
Jackson must be one great teacher, Tay.
You're driving this car like an old pro.

225
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,765
<i>Trés impressive. non?</i>

226
00:16:24,216 --> 00:16:26,081
Oh, no.

227
00:16:26,151 --> 00:16:28,483
This... You...

228
00:16:28,554 --> 00:16:30,613
I... Uhh!

229
00:16:30,689 --> 00:16:33,487
I just really don't know where I failed.

230
00:16:33,559 --> 00:16:36,289
- Nowhere. You're perfect.
- The absolute best.

231
00:16:36,362 --> 00:16:39,798
I'm not talking about me, girls,
I'm talking about you two.

232
00:16:39,865 --> 00:16:44,097
We know. We're total screw-ups
and we couldn't be sorrier.

233
00:16:44,169 --> 00:16:47,036
- What can we do?
- We can't go on like this.

234
00:16:47,106 --> 00:16:49,939
This kitchen
was your mother's favorite room.

235
00:16:50,009 --> 00:16:53,706
She created our most popular recipes here.
Something's gotta change.

236
00:16:53,779 --> 00:16:57,545
I've done nothing to teach you
anything about responsibility.

237
00:16:57,616 --> 00:17:00,744
That's not true. We always put
our clothes in the hamper.

238
00:17:00,819 --> 00:17:03,549
- I separate my colors from the whites.
- Yeah.

239
00:17:03,622 --> 00:17:08,582
I'm talking about
reaching a little higher, ladies.

240
00:17:08,660 --> 00:17:12,619
- We could take out the trash once a week.
- Twice, if that's what you want.

241
00:17:12,698 --> 00:17:15,326
No. I've come to a decision.

242
00:17:15,401 --> 00:17:16,732
Uh-oh.

243
00:17:16,802 --> 00:17:21,205
- This sounds bad.
- You're canceling our personal trainer?

244
00:17:21,273 --> 00:17:25,767
I'm insisting you take a summer job.

245
00:17:26,145 --> 00:17:27,339
You're teasing, right?

246
00:17:27,413 --> 00:17:30,905
I really don't think he is, girls.
This is very serious business.

247
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:37,286
It's settled. Tomorrow morning, bright
and early, you report to work at the dairy.

248
00:17:37,356 --> 00:17:41,292
But my cotillion's next Saturday.

249
00:17:41,360 --> 00:17:43,487
I'm the only girl that doesn't have a date.

250
00:17:43,562 --> 00:17:46,690
Who am I supposed to do
the Spotlight Dance with?

251
00:17:46,765 --> 00:17:51,862
You don't understand. There's a million
details we have to handle. I can't work.

252
00:17:51,937 --> 00:17:54,906
You can and you will.
Your shift is from seven to three.

253
00:17:54,973 --> 00:17:57,771
You can party-plan afterwards.

254
00:17:57,843 --> 00:18:01,335
Seven... in the morning?

255
00:18:01,413 --> 00:18:02,880
That's earlier than school!

256
00:18:02,948 --> 00:18:07,851
Don't do this. We won't spend anything or
go anywhere! We'll become social rejects!

257
00:18:07,920 --> 00:18:11,219
I've cancelled your credit cards
and revoked your allowance.

258
00:18:11,290 --> 00:18:15,886
You girls are finally gonna learn
what it means to earn what you want.

259
00:18:21,533 --> 00:18:23,763
<i>Good morning. River City!</i>

260
00:18:23,836 --> 00:18:29,468
<i>Shake off those cobwebs</i>.
<i>wipe the sleep from your eyes. It's five...</i>

261
00:18:37,749 --> 00:18:38,807
Uhh!

262
00:18:44,022 --> 00:18:45,819
Ahh, stop! I can't take it.

263
00:18:45,891 --> 00:18:49,725
- Rise and shine, working girls.
- Turn off the light.

264
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:53,788
Let's go. I got a plane to catch
and you have to report to duty.

265
00:18:53,866 --> 00:18:56,733
- If the sun isn't up, why should we be?
- Yeah.

266
00:18:56,802 --> 00:19:00,499
Nobody ever said that reality was pretty.

267
00:19:00,572 --> 00:19:03,905
- Aah!
- Ow!

268
00:19:07,579 --> 00:19:08,568
Dads.

269
00:19:08,647 --> 00:19:13,983
Remember, where I'm headed
is so remote, there's no cell service.

270
00:19:14,052 --> 00:19:15,747
Ach, why even live?

271
00:19:15,821 --> 00:19:18,619
My point is, I can't be checking up on you,

272
00:19:18,690 --> 00:19:22,854
so I need you guys to promise me
that everything is gonna go OK.

273
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,987
Of course it will, Daddy.

274
00:19:25,063 --> 00:19:27,497
We won't embarrass you, we promise.

275
00:19:27,566 --> 00:19:30,729
Who knows?
You might even like working.

276
00:19:30,802 --> 00:19:34,863
You might find it interesting.

277
00:19:34,940 --> 00:19:39,502
OK, all right, OK.
Just... Just try to behave, OK?

278
00:19:39,578 --> 00:19:42,775
Make a good impression.
Make me proud.

279
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:46,784
Will you quit worrying? They have to
love us. We're the boss's daughters.

280
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:50,913
Yeah. OK.
Bye, girls.

281
00:19:50,989 --> 00:19:53,583
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

282
00:19:53,659 --> 00:19:57,595
- Remember, blinker, blinker.
- Yeah, we got it, Dad.

283
00:19:57,663 --> 00:19:59,688
- Up to the left.
- Seatbelts on.

284
00:19:59,765 --> 00:20:01,392
- Love you.
- Love you, too.

285
00:20:01,466 --> 00:20:02,831
- Whoo-hoo!
- Whoa!

286
00:20:26,491 --> 00:20:29,358
- Knock, knock!
- Morning, Uncle Bob.

287
00:20:29,428 --> 00:20:33,524
Girls! You're right on time.

288
00:20:33,599 --> 00:20:39,504
Just give me one quick second.

289
00:20:39,571 --> 00:20:41,129
There.

290
00:20:41,206 --> 00:20:45,142
So... Bet you never figured
it would come to this.

291
00:20:45,210 --> 00:20:46,700
Isn't it so cruel of Daddy?

292
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:50,441
You know, he's only doing
what he thinks is best.

293
00:20:50,515 --> 00:20:52,244
Did he get off to the airport OK?

294
00:20:52,317 --> 00:20:55,047
He's way excited.
That was really nice of you.

295
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:57,611
Hey, what are friends for?

296
00:20:57,689 --> 00:21:02,752
Anyway, it's Fran Walker, our production
supervisor, you'll be reporting to.

297
00:21:02,828 --> 00:21:07,424
So let's track her down
and get you to work.

298
00:21:13,639 --> 00:21:17,075
- What a great picture of Mom.
- She was something, your mother.

299
00:21:17,142 --> 00:21:19,167
The power behind the throne.

300
00:21:19,244 --> 00:21:23,374
Look at you, all grown up
and ready to follow in her footsteps.

301
00:21:23,448 --> 00:21:28,545
- We're here 'cause Daddy's forcing us.
- We're complete disasters in the kitchen.

302
00:21:28,620 --> 00:21:31,384
Not like Mom at all.

303
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:35,756
We hope you'll let us work in an office,
answering phones, making coffee.

304
00:21:35,827 --> 00:21:38,796
- Working people love coffee, right?
- Mm-hmm.

305
00:21:38,864 --> 00:21:41,833
She's being way modest,
but Courtney's a computer geek.

306
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:45,734
Like, if you need supplies,
online shopping is her specialty.

307
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:49,968
Taylor's a total math-head. She can figure
out sale prices better than anybody.

308
00:21:50,042 --> 00:21:51,566
Oh, stop.

309
00:21:51,643 --> 00:21:58,606
Your father was very specific about
wanting you here on the production line.

310
00:21:58,684 --> 00:22:01,244
Please, no. Not that.

311
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:04,255
We'll start you off with something simple.

312
00:22:04,323 --> 00:22:06,723
- But, over there?
- Mm-hmm.

313
00:22:06,792 --> 00:22:09,590
- Like them?
- Yeah.

314
00:22:09,661 --> 00:22:13,097
Wearing that?

315
00:22:13,165 --> 00:22:15,827
Mm-hmm.

316
00:22:15,901 --> 00:22:16,890
OK.

317
00:22:38,457 --> 00:22:41,722
Honestly, I wish you knew
how hilarious you look.

318
00:22:41,793 --> 00:22:46,924
- Like you look any better.
- Except I can't see me, so who cares?

319
00:22:49,034 --> 00:22:50,331
What are you doing?

320
00:22:50,402 --> 00:22:53,030
I am so gonna send
a picture to Jackson Meade.

321
00:22:53,105 --> 00:22:55,073
- Courtney, gimme that!
- No!

322
00:22:55,140 --> 00:22:56,437
No!

323
00:22:59,111 --> 00:23:00,043
Uh-oh.

324
00:23:00,112 --> 00:23:01,579
Now look what you did!

325
00:23:01,646 --> 00:23:04,581
Taylor, just get it!
Do something!

326
00:23:04,649 --> 00:23:06,947
- Stop the presses.
- What?

327
00:23:07,018 --> 00:23:10,613
My sister's phone kinda accidentally
flew into one of your tubs.

328
00:23:10,689 --> 00:23:12,987
A phone?
Which tub?

329
00:23:13,058 --> 00:23:16,926
We don't know.
We lost track.

330
00:23:18,697 --> 00:23:23,327
Well, this is great. What are we
supposed to do, scrap the whole run?

331
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,336
How could you two be so careless?

332
00:23:25,404 --> 00:23:29,397
We're sorry. We're new at this.
It's not like we meant to cause trouble.

333
00:23:29,474 --> 00:23:35,208
- It was a simple mistake.
- Yeah, a costly and stupid mistake.

334
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:39,478
Hold on, Mr. Whatever-Your-Last-Name-Is.

335
00:23:39,551 --> 00:23:42,452
You can't call Daddy.
He's out of cell range, remember?

336
00:23:42,521 --> 00:23:44,250
But you're not.

337
00:23:44,322 --> 00:23:46,756
Hello? Why call me? I'm right here.

338
00:23:49,428 --> 00:23:51,623
Hm.

339
00:23:51,696 --> 00:23:55,496
Problem solved.

340
00:23:55,567 --> 00:23:57,467
Ew.

341
00:23:57,536 --> 00:24:01,632
And how do you suppose I make up
for the four minutes of lost production time?

342
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,968
My phone!

343
00:24:03,041 --> 00:24:05,134
Can you control
the speed of the machine?

344
00:24:05,210 --> 00:24:06,734
Yeah.

345
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:11,613
OK. Then, if you ramp it up
by 15 seconds for 16 minutes,

346
00:24:11,683 --> 00:24:15,210
then you'll regain your lost time
and be back on schedule! Yeah.

347
00:24:15,287 --> 00:24:18,313
Yeah, what she said.

348
00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:23,227
This is coming out of your pay.
Back to work.

349
00:24:38,310 --> 00:24:40,608
Wait, no.
That's backwards.

350
00:24:40,679 --> 00:24:41,771
Come on!

351
00:24:41,847 --> 00:24:42,871
Oh.

352
00:24:45,250 --> 00:24:47,275
'K, this one's not good.

353
00:24:48,720 --> 00:24:51,416
Oh! Ick.

354
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:55,392
Finally, quitting time.
Oh, yeah.

355
00:24:55,460 --> 00:24:58,657
Hate to break it to you, sis -
it's only lunch.

356
00:25:00,198 --> 00:25:01,187
Yeah.

357
00:25:03,802 --> 00:25:06,032
I am not happy right now!

358
00:25:06,104 --> 00:25:07,332
Oh.

359
00:25:13,612 --> 00:25:15,705
Oh.

360
00:25:15,780 --> 00:25:18,408
Hm.

361
00:25:18,917 --> 00:25:21,112
This is a tad awkward.

362
00:25:21,186 --> 00:25:23,279
Yeah.

363
00:25:23,355 --> 00:25:27,189
Just smile and wave
and maybe they won't hurt us.

364
00:25:29,561 --> 00:25:30,892
- Hi.
- Hi.

365
00:25:33,465 --> 00:25:38,562
All because of one dropped cell phone.
These people seriously need to lighten up.

366
00:25:38,637 --> 00:25:40,798
Courtney, Taylor!
What are you doing here?

367
00:25:40,872 --> 00:25:44,399
Mr. Perez! Heather didn't tell you?
Daddy sent us to work.

368
00:25:44,476 --> 00:25:45,534
Ah...

369
00:25:45,610 --> 00:25:48,909
Guess that explains
this morning's production slowdown.

370
00:25:48,980 --> 00:25:51,744
- You heard?
- Everybody heard.

371
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:55,650
- Life in a small company - no secrets.
- Oh!

372
00:25:55,720 --> 00:25:59,588
- Where are your lunches?
- There isn't a caterer?

373
00:26:00,825 --> 00:26:06,889
Well, until you can take that up with your
father, you'll have to rely on our machines.

374
00:26:10,268 --> 00:26:11,792
- Gross.
- Ew.

375
00:26:14,773 --> 00:26:18,607
Gina and I can't wait for the party.
We're flattered you included us.

376
00:26:18,677 --> 00:26:21,646
Are you kidding?
You guys are like my second parents.

377
00:26:21,713 --> 00:26:24,773
- Heather says it's gonna be great.
- If I ever get a date.

378
00:26:24,849 --> 00:26:27,716
- You still haven't asked anybody?
- Like who?

379
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:32,920
- Bye.
- <i>Au revoir.</i>

380
00:26:34,926 --> 00:26:37,224
How about him?

381
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,763
- Who's that?
- His name is Philippe.

382
00:26:39,831 --> 00:26:43,323
An exchange student from France
living with the Millers for a year.

383
00:26:43,401 --> 00:26:46,461
Your dad got him
an internship for the summer.

384
00:26:46,538 --> 00:26:48,005
Huh.

385
00:26:48,073 --> 00:26:51,474
Good ol' Dad.

386
00:26:51,543 --> 00:26:54,979
What are you doing?
Go after him!

387
00:26:55,046 --> 00:26:58,311
Make up for this lousy lunch
by having a French pastry for dessert.

388
00:26:58,383 --> 00:27:01,944
Taylor! I can't. What if he doesn't like me?
What if he says no?

389
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:06,616
It's all too terrifying
and potentially humiliating. I can't move.

390
00:27:11,730 --> 00:27:14,893
Oh, yeah!
It's Monday, I forgot.

391
00:27:14,966 --> 00:27:19,665
You're gonna love this. This is one of your
dad's ideas called "Homemade Jams."

392
00:27:30,048 --> 00:27:33,484
# Early in the mornin', risin' and shine

393
00:27:33,551 --> 00:27:36,816
# Joinin' my friends in the workin' line

394
00:27:36,888 --> 00:27:40,085
# Might be tired,
but we don't pull blame

395
00:27:40,158 --> 00:27:42,991
# Got a lot to do today

396
00:27:43,061 --> 00:27:46,360
# And we're bound to be a family

397
00:27:46,431 --> 00:27:50,231
# And we're bound to call this home

398
00:27:50,301 --> 00:27:53,600
# Happy to be right here, you see

399
00:27:53,672 --> 00:27:57,073
# Workin' at the creamery

400
00:27:57,142 --> 00:28:00,202
# Creams to curdle and butter to churn

401
00:28:00,278 --> 00:28:03,736
# Surrounded by cattle everywhere I turn

402
00:28:03,815 --> 00:28:06,978
# Hope they're right
when they say it won't hurt

403
00:28:07,052 --> 00:28:10,510
# Livin' on nothin' but yogurt

404
00:28:10,588 --> 00:28:13,989
# Well, we're bound to be a family

405
00:28:14,059 --> 00:28:17,722
# And we're bound to call this home

406
00:28:17,796 --> 00:28:21,061
# We're happy to be right here, you see

407
00:28:21,132 --> 00:28:25,865
# Together at the creamery

408
00:28:33,378 --> 00:28:37,405
All right, if anybody wants to come up
and join us, now is your chance.

409
00:28:37,482 --> 00:28:41,680
Ooh! Me and my sister are really
good singers! Can we do backup?

410
00:28:41,753 --> 00:28:46,213
Thanks anyway,
but this band's for real working folk.

411
00:28:46,291 --> 00:28:48,486
You'd be better off
joining the Pretenders.

412
00:29:04,142 --> 00:29:08,772
It's so rude, the way everybody's acting
like they're not watching us but they so are.

413
00:29:08,847 --> 00:29:10,781
Just waiting for us to mess up again.

414
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:16,253
Yeah! Would it be so hard to be
supportive? We're trying our best.

415
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,915
Maybe if we moved a bit faster.

416
00:29:18,990 --> 00:29:21,220
Like it's not hard enough?

417
00:29:22,594 --> 00:29:27,896
Come on, Court, let's show 'em
what the Callum girls are made of.

418
00:29:27,966 --> 00:29:30,833
Yeah.

419
00:29:40,211 --> 00:29:42,236
Oh!

420
00:29:42,313 --> 00:29:45,009
No.

421
00:29:45,083 --> 00:29:48,211
Sorry, our bad.

422
00:29:48,286 --> 00:29:51,983
Honest mistake.
Point us to the mops and we'll clean up.

423
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,620
- Good blueberries, though. Yeah.
- What she said.

424
00:30:03,635 --> 00:30:05,466
I... Um...

425
00:30:05,537 --> 00:30:07,164
No, don't go.

426
00:30:07,238 --> 00:30:09,001
Little help?

427
00:30:09,073 --> 00:30:11,098
Somebody? Anyone?

428
00:30:17,916 --> 00:30:20,817
Get shoe... Shoe...

429
00:30:28,726 --> 00:30:31,786
OK.

430
00:30:31,863 --> 00:30:33,387
Yay!

431
00:30:35,433 --> 00:30:39,392
I cannot wait to tell Corrine
we did our own laundry!

432
00:30:39,470 --> 00:30:41,267
- I'm taking this for proof.
- Court?

433
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,328
- Yeah?
- Put it down.

434
00:30:42,407 --> 00:30:45,171
'K.

435
00:30:46,878 --> 00:30:49,039
- There you go, Joyce.
- Thanks, Melvin.

436
00:30:49,113 --> 00:30:54,483
Peter Palmer. This should get you
one step closer to that new patio.

437
00:30:54,552 --> 00:30:57,544
Not this week. This one's going
towards my daughter's braces.

438
00:30:57,622 --> 00:30:59,749
- Good one.
- Do you have one for us?

439
00:30:59,824 --> 00:31:05,194
Well, if it isn't the Callum sisters!
Don't you look beautiful?

440
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:09,199
Thanks, Melvin. You, too. So how much
do we get for one whole day?

441
00:31:09,267 --> 00:31:15,137
Believe it or not, my darlings, you don't
get paid unless you work an entire week.

442
00:31:15,206 --> 00:31:18,107
That's no fair. How am I supposed to
buy nail polish and bubble bath?

443
00:31:18,176 --> 00:31:19,370
Yeah.

444
00:31:19,444 --> 00:31:24,347
By putting that pretty little nose
to the grindstone and keeping it there.

445
00:31:24,415 --> 00:31:26,144
That would really hurt.

446
00:31:26,217 --> 00:31:28,981
And you'd totally end up
looking like a pug dog.

447
00:31:29,053 --> 00:31:30,748
Yeah.

448
00:31:30,822 --> 00:31:34,690
'Night, Melvin! I'm so happy
to see you're still around.

449
00:31:43,768 --> 00:31:45,793
There he is!

450
00:31:49,440 --> 00:31:51,533
What are you doing here? Slumming?

451
00:31:51,609 --> 00:31:55,545
"Gliding through life without a clue."

452
00:31:55,613 --> 00:31:59,811
- Actually, we were working.
- We made it through one whole day.

453
00:31:59,884 --> 00:32:01,909
I guess miracles never cease.

454
00:32:04,255 --> 00:32:08,589
Daddy left me the check for your truck.
Would you like me to bring it over later?

455
00:32:08,660 --> 00:32:10,855
Or I can come by and get it.

456
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:15,457
That's OK. I was kinda hoping
to see how Martha's doing.

457
00:32:15,533 --> 00:32:16,864
Really?

458
00:32:16,935 --> 00:32:19,529
How about I come over around seven?

459
00:32:19,604 --> 00:32:21,731
That'll work.

460
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:25,207
I'll see you then.

461
00:32:25,276 --> 00:32:26,641
OK.

462
00:32:26,711 --> 00:32:28,235
Come on.

463
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:36,413
If it wasn't for your dad,
I don't know what we'd have done.

464
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:41,447
- Everybody else was so harsh.
- Is it our fault Daddy owns the place?

465
00:32:41,526 --> 00:32:43,824
I saw an adorable
French guy in the lunchroom.

466
00:32:43,895 --> 00:32:46,557
He's an exchange student
living with the Millers.

467
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,965
- She wants him to be her party date.
- Is Richie Miller invited to your party?

468
00:32:51,035 --> 00:32:54,027
Why would he be?
He's hardly the cotillion type.

469
00:32:54,105 --> 00:32:56,573
- Then it's perfect!
- What?

470
00:32:56,641 --> 00:33:01,908
After dinner, we'll take Richie an invitation.
We'll say it got lost in the mail.

471
00:33:01,980 --> 00:33:05,313
He'll mention Frenchie,
we'll act all surprised and invite him!

472
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:07,715
- Heather, that's brilliant.
- I know!

473
00:33:07,785 --> 00:33:09,150
- Wanna come?
- I can't.

474
00:33:09,220 --> 00:33:12,189
She's gonna see Jackson.
He's gonna be your boyfriend.

475
00:33:12,256 --> 00:33:16,386
- Really? He's hot.
- And way in love with my sister.

came back, which made me feel awful.

I'm sure you were hurt, thinking...

498
00:34:37,642 --> 00:34:41,305
To be honest, I didn't even know
there was gonna be a party.

499
00:34:41,379 --> 00:34:43,279
Oh!

00:34:43,347 --> 00:34:46,145
But you wanna come?
Everybody's gonna be there.

501
00:34:46,217 --> 00:34:49,050
- Everyone.
- Will there be video games?

502
00:34:50,354 --> 00:34:55,519
Richie, it's a dance party,
with tons of beautiful girls like us.

503
00:34:55,593 --> 00:34:58,426
Oh.

504
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:02,863
If it make you feel more comfortable,
you could bring someone.

505
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:08,201
- Like a friend, a foreign exchange student.
- If you happen to have one.

506
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:11,764
- I do! He's from France.
- You're kidding!

507
00:35:11,843 --> 00:35:14,073
Is he here?
Should we ask him now?

508
00:35:14,145 --> 00:35:19,344
He's upstairs.
Why don't I go see what he thinks?

509
00:35:19,417 --> 00:35:21,715
- Nice.
- Yes.

510
00:35:32,130 --> 00:35:36,123
Wow. So, this is my first American...

511
00:35:36,200 --> 00:35:38,191
How you call it?

512
00:35:38,269 --> 00:35:40,999
"How you call it?"
Isn't that darling?

513
00:35:41,072 --> 00:35:44,701
It's a cotillion,
a kind of coming-out party.

514
00:35:44,775 --> 00:35:47,266
Coming out of what?

515
00:35:47,345 --> 00:35:49,575
Philippe, you're so funny!

516
00:35:49,647 --> 00:35:53,378
So will you come and be Courtney's date?

517
00:35:53,451 --> 00:35:58,582
It would... please me much... to attend.

518
00:35:58,656 --> 00:36:01,819
Thank you, Philippe.
I'm thrilled.

519
00:36:01,893 --> 00:36:05,385
Look for me at work tomorrow, OK? Oh...

520
00:36:05,463 --> 00:36:07,897
We're glad you're coming, too.
See you there.

521
00:36:07,965 --> 00:36:11,867
Bye.

522
00:36:13,171 --> 00:36:17,267
<i>Good morning. River City!</i>
<i>Can you believe it? It's 5:30...</i>

523
00:36:17,341 --> 00:36:19,206
Oh, no! Jackson!

524
00:36:19,277 --> 00:36:23,270
<i>It's time for a beautiful</i>
<i>brand-new morning.</i>

525
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:25,907
Did you say something?

526
00:36:25,983 --> 00:36:28,474
Jackson - I stood him up.

527
00:36:28,553 --> 00:36:30,885
I blew it.

528
00:36:30,955 --> 00:36:34,220
I'll bet he hates my guts.

529
00:36:34,292 --> 00:36:38,490
And the really bad news is...
we have to go to work again.

530
00:36:38,563 --> 00:36:41,498
<i>Your favorite hits</i>
<i>from the '</i>7<i>0s. '80s and '90s.</i>

531
00:36:46,704 --> 00:36:49,969
- You're not listening. Our checks bounced.
- All of them.

532
00:36:50,041 --> 00:36:52,032
But that just can't be.

533
00:36:52,109 --> 00:36:56,068
My books have always
been unimpeachable.

534
00:36:56,147 --> 00:37:00,584
Why do you think that I've never relied
on the computer monkey business?

535
00:37:00,651 --> 00:37:04,485
Because I always make them out by hand
so they're absolutely perfect.

536
00:37:04,555 --> 00:37:09,925
- I think the banks would beg to differ.
- Well, I'm not responsible...

537
00:37:09,994 --> 00:37:12,861
- Maybe they know something.
- Where's your father?

538
00:37:12,930 --> 00:37:18,630
- Why did our checks bounce?
- Wait, shh. Please, please. Quiet. Um...

539
00:37:18,703 --> 00:37:21,797
- We seem to be broke.
- What?

540
00:37:21,872 --> 00:37:25,831
Daddy ran out of money?
Oh, there's no possible way.

541
00:37:25,910 --> 00:37:29,869
Unfortunately, there is a way.

542
00:37:30,881 --> 00:37:34,044
I just got off the phone
with Nelson Partridge at the bank.

543
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:37,645
Apparently your father
took more than luggage on his trip.

544
00:37:37,722 --> 00:37:40,213
Our company account
is completely wiped out.

545
00:37:40,291 --> 00:37:44,387
- There's no money?
- He didn't do anything bad. He couldn't.

546
00:37:44,462 --> 00:37:47,363
- He wouldn't.
- I'd never believe it, but the money's gone.

547
00:37:47,431 --> 00:37:50,798
There has to be an explanation.
I've known Reed over 20 years.

548
00:37:50,868 --> 00:37:53,564
This is not something he's capable of.

549
00:37:53,638 --> 00:37:56,664
He's done everything he can
to make this a great place to work.

550
00:37:56,741 --> 00:38:00,541
I've been here since the very beginning
and I can assure all of you

551
00:38:00,611 --> 00:38:03,478
that Reed Callum is a true humanitarian.

552
00:38:03,547 --> 00:38:06,311
Before we jump to terrible,
damaging conclusions,

553
00:38:06,384 --> 00:38:10,184
maybe the best thing I can do
is get on a plane and try to track him down.

554
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,552
What are we supposed to do
in the meantime?

555
00:38:12,623 --> 00:38:14,284
If I'm not paid, I'm not working.

556
00:38:14,358 --> 00:38:18,021
No. We have to keep working
or we'll miss our delivery deadlines.

557
00:38:18,095 --> 00:38:20,427
Please, just for today.

558
00:38:20,498 --> 00:38:23,797
We owe Mr. Callum that much
until we get this straightened out.

559
00:38:23,868 --> 00:38:29,602
Daddy would never rip you guys off.
He loves this place and he loves all of you.

560
00:38:29,674 --> 00:38:32,234
Which is why we need
to get back to work at once!

561
00:38:32,310 --> 00:38:34,141
No!

562
00:38:43,554 --> 00:38:47,217
Ugh! Oh, no!

563
00:38:47,291 --> 00:38:49,418
Oh, dear!

564
00:38:49,493 --> 00:38:51,484
Look at you!

565
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:56,590
- Sorry. So sorry.
- Stay right there.

566
00:38:56,667 --> 00:38:58,726
Just stay there.

567
00:39:10,381 --> 00:39:14,374
This is terrible. Everybody's freaking out,
Daddy's gone, his money's gone.

568
00:39:14,452 --> 00:39:18,445
- Are we gonna be poor?
- Bite your tongue!

569
00:39:18,522 --> 00:39:24,119
We just have to hope Uncle Bob can track
him down and get to the bottom of this.

570
00:39:24,195 --> 00:39:30,225
Do you think Bob's left yet? I want him
to tell Daddy how much we believe in him.

571
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,326
Come on, let's go see.

572
00:39:37,908 --> 00:39:40,968
That's weird. He left.

573
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:43,878
Why's this in the trash?

574
00:39:43,948 --> 00:39:46,280
And all broken.

575
00:39:46,350 --> 00:39:52,721
Do you think Uncle Bob flipped out 'cause
he actually believes Daddy's a crook?

576
00:39:52,790 --> 00:39:57,227
Or what if it's Uncle Bob who's the crook?
Think about it, Court.

577
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,263
What if that's how come
he gave Dad a generous trip?

578
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:04,233
- To get him out of the way and set him up!
- That's so evil.

579
00:40:04,301 --> 00:40:08,328
I know. But listen,
we're positive Daddy didn't take the money

580
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:12,900
and yet it's gone,
so who else could be a logical suspect?

581
00:40:12,977 --> 00:40:15,207
What are we gonna do?

582
00:40:17,114 --> 00:40:19,810
Girls. This is an unexpected surprise.

583
00:40:19,884 --> 00:40:24,014
Come on in. Courtney and Taylor Callum,
this is Keith, my husband.

584
00:40:24,088 --> 00:40:26,750
- Hi.
- He works the night shift at the dairy.

585
00:40:26,824 --> 00:40:29,122
- Hello, girls.
- Hi, Keith.

586
00:40:29,193 --> 00:40:32,026
We're sorry to barge in
on you like this, Fran.

587
00:40:32,096 --> 00:40:34,826
But look.

588
00:40:34,899 --> 00:40:35,957
Oh.

589
00:40:36,033 --> 00:40:38,467
Should this mean something to me?

590
00:40:38,536 --> 00:40:41,505
Daddy gave that picture
to Bob as a gift last week.

591
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:45,440
Only we found it in Bob's trash
in his office with the glass smashed.

592
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:48,637
Taylor thought, what if it's
Bob who took the money? I agree!

593
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:52,204
I'd buy that. Something about this guy
always seemed a bit off to me.

594
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:55,946
Like making us call him "Uncle"
when we're not even related.

595
00:40:56,020 --> 00:40:57,180
Yeah, right.

596
00:40:57,254 --> 00:41:01,213
It's no secret Bob was furious
when your dad wouldn't sell the dairy.

597
00:41:01,292 --> 00:41:02,281
Sell the dairy?

598
00:41:02,359 --> 00:41:06,796
Old Man Ketchem wanted to buy us out,
convert to a fully-automated plant like his.

599
00:41:06,864 --> 00:41:09,833
Your dad wouldn't hear of it
'cause we'd be out of work.

600
00:41:09,900 --> 00:41:11,527
I knew Daddy was a good guy.

601
00:41:11,602 --> 00:41:15,698
In my opinion, Bob never got over
missing out on that bag of cash.

602
00:41:15,773 --> 00:41:17,001
So what do we do now?

603
00:41:17,074 --> 00:41:19,941
Why don't you stay for dinner
and we'll talk about it?

604
00:41:20,010 --> 00:41:23,912
- We're making pizza.
- We don't want to intrude.

605
00:41:23,981 --> 00:41:27,348
- You won't intrude. We'll put you to work.
- Yeah.

606
00:41:28,853 --> 00:41:31,321
OK.

607
00:41:33,324 --> 00:41:36,760
- He's such a show-off, isn't he?
- You're just jealous.

608
00:41:36,827 --> 00:41:38,920
Who knew cooking could be so fun?

609
00:41:38,996 --> 00:41:44,127
Take my advice, girls.
Marry someone who loves to cook.

610
00:41:44,201 --> 00:41:45,190
Whoa!

611
00:41:45,269 --> 00:41:49,433
- What are we doing, feeding an army?
- This one's for an elderly neighbor.

612
00:41:49,507 --> 00:41:54,137
- That's so sweet.
- It's just the neighborly thing to do.

613
00:41:55,613 --> 00:41:56,910
Whoo!

614
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:00,206
I am not eating that!

615
00:42:02,019 --> 00:42:04,886
We have to get our flowers
from the Gilded Lily.

616
00:42:04,955 --> 00:42:08,516
Everybody knows they do the most
gorgeous arrangements in town.

617
00:42:08,592 --> 00:42:11,891
Yeah, but they're also twice
as expensive as everybody else.

618
00:42:11,962 --> 00:42:14,829
Well, duh!
What do you think makes them the best?

619
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,595
OK. If we spend $10,000 on flowers,

620
00:42:17,668 --> 00:42:22,128
we can have the balloon arch or the
ice sculpture, but we can't afford both.

621
00:42:22,206 --> 00:42:23,730
Aw, bummer.

622
00:42:23,807 --> 00:42:26,640
Let's be practical.
The ice sculpture will melt.

623
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:29,975
But it's so classic!
It's our signature thing. We need it.

624
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:32,379
What if we cut out
the seafood appetizer bar?

625
00:42:32,449 --> 00:42:36,510
That's the most original thing on our menu.
Everybody will love it!

626
00:42:36,587 --> 00:42:40,614
Obviously, we're just gonna
have to ask our dads for more money.

627
00:42:40,691 --> 00:42:47,062
Haven't they been clear? We have to work
in our budget. They're not giving us more.

628
00:42:47,131 --> 00:42:50,123
This is unfair. Why does
everything have to cost so much?

629
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,466
Sarah insists we must have steak
and lobster. What's wrong with chicken?

630
00:42:54,538 --> 00:42:58,634
This isn't some stupid business banquet.
Chicken's a tacky no-no.

631
00:42:58,709 --> 00:43:03,544
Seriously! I mean, if we're not gonna
top last year's girls, why even do this at all?

632
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:05,548
- Exactly.
- Hmph!

633
00:43:05,616 --> 00:43:09,177
Maybe we're not figuring it out right.
Gimme the numbers. I'll talk to Taylor.

634
00:43:09,253 --> 00:43:13,087
- She's like Rain Man with math.
- Plus she's been through this already.

635
00:43:13,157 --> 00:43:16,388
I'll bet she can tell us
what we're doing wrong.

636
00:43:19,830 --> 00:43:25,791
See? It's impossible. When did the world
get to be so expensive?

637
00:43:25,869 --> 00:43:28,804
I've got a feeling
it's always been this way, Court.

638
00:43:28,872 --> 00:43:32,171
We're just finally being forced
to pay attention.

639
00:43:32,242 --> 00:43:37,407
Whoever came up with "ignorance is bliss"
was really onto something.

640
00:43:37,481 --> 00:43:43,113
Speaking of that, after being
at Fran's tonight, I was thinking...

641
00:43:43,187 --> 00:43:45,587
Uh-oh.
This can't be good.

642
00:43:45,656 --> 00:43:50,059
With everything going on at the dairy
and Daddy being out of reach,

643
00:43:50,127 --> 00:43:54,325
doesn't it feel like it's sort of
up to us to try to fix this mess?

644
00:43:54,398 --> 00:43:56,491
No.

645
00:43:56,567 --> 00:44:00,196
Court... you saw how it is.

646
00:44:00,270 --> 00:44:05,731
People like Fran and Keith
totally depend on Dad for... their life.

647
00:44:05,809 --> 00:44:09,643
Can we seriously sit back
and let it all fall apart?

648
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:13,308
Talor, hello. I thought we were
talking about my party problems.

649
00:44:13,384 --> 00:44:17,047
Well... in a weird way, we are.

650
00:44:19,623 --> 00:44:25,823
I think we should use your party allowance
to cover the dairy workers' salaries.

651
00:44:25,896 --> 00:44:29,195
You got me so good. For a second,
I thought you were serious.

652
00:44:29,266 --> 00:44:31,131
I am.

653
00:44:31,201 --> 00:44:34,500
Have you totally lost it?
I can't do that.

654
00:44:34,571 --> 00:44:38,029
The girls and I are splitting all costs,
the way it's always done.

655
00:44:38,108 --> 00:44:40,508
If I can't contribute,
how can I be part of it?

656
00:44:40,577 --> 00:44:46,072
I guess you can't. I'm really sorry,
but this is totally a family emergency.

657
00:44:46,150 --> 00:44:48,380
It's not my emergency.

658
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:53,219
It's fine for you to be noble, you
already had your most amazing cotillion.

659
00:44:53,290 --> 00:44:55,554
Now it's my turn.

660
00:44:55,626 --> 00:44:59,960
My chance to shine. It's really
mean of you to try to take that away.

661
00:45:00,030 --> 00:45:04,399
All right, OK? Calm down.
It was only a suggestion.

662
00:45:04,468 --> 00:45:07,164
We'll have to figure out
another way to help.

663
00:45:07,237 --> 00:45:11,264
Exactly.
Thank you for coming to your senses.

664
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,903
Oh, no!

665
00:45:14,978 --> 00:45:18,573
I still have to deal with Jackson.

666
00:45:23,954 --> 00:45:27,253
Meade Dairy Farms. Uh, yeah.

667
00:45:27,324 --> 00:45:30,054
Whom may I say is calling? Yeah.

668
00:45:30,127 --> 00:45:35,190
Hold on a minute. I'll get him.
It's Taylor Callum, for you.

669
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:38,291
I'm not here.

670
00:45:38,368 --> 00:45:41,826
He says he's not here.

671
00:45:41,905 --> 00:45:47,775
All right. She's says she's sorry she didn't
make it by last night. She'd like to explain.

672
00:45:47,845 --> 00:45:52,373
I'm not interested, OK?
Just tell her to put the check in the mail.

673
00:45:56,987 --> 00:45:58,386
Uh, Taylor.

674
00:45:58,455 --> 00:46:01,913
He had to run off
to the bathroom. Um...

675
00:46:01,992 --> 00:46:04,153
OK.

676
00:46:04,228 --> 00:46:07,129
Yeah, I'll tell him.
OK, bye.

677
00:46:14,371 --> 00:46:19,809
We're asking everybody to report
to the lunchroom for a meeting. Melvin?

678
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:22,402
It won't take long. Hi.

679
00:46:22,479 --> 00:46:24,640
Look, we will find a solution.

680
00:46:24,715 --> 00:46:30,915
Trouble is, all our products are perishable.
A shutdown is something we can't afford.

681
00:46:30,988 --> 00:46:33,786
How long do you think
we should work without pay?

682
00:46:33,857 --> 00:46:36,655
Do you think my landlord cares
if our inventory goes bad?

683
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,888
He wants to know
when I'm gonna pay the rent!

684
00:46:38,962 --> 00:46:43,661
The reality is, most of us live paycheck
to paycheck. I'm as loyal as anyone,

685
00:46:43,734 --> 00:46:46,396
but if there's no future here,
we wanna know that now.

686
00:46:46,470 --> 00:46:50,497
Of course there's a future!
It's just gonna require some patience.

687
00:46:56,046 --> 00:47:01,279
Please, it's just... Look, I know
we will find an answer to this problem.

688
00:47:01,351 --> 00:47:05,082
Do me a huge favor?
I left my cell phone in the car.

689
00:47:05,155 --> 00:47:06,315
So?

690
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,053
So I need to see if Jackson called
so I can call him back.

691
00:47:10,127 --> 00:47:13,255
- Please go get it for me.
- Why can't you?

692
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:17,357
Because, unlike some people,
I'm actually listening to what's going on.

693
00:47:17,434 --> 00:47:21,063
- Please, Court? Please?
- Fine, but you owe me.

694
00:47:21,138 --> 00:47:23,368
- Thanks, sis. You're a doll.
- Whatev.

695
00:47:23,440 --> 00:47:26,932
I know, we're all in this together, though.

696
00:47:30,514 --> 00:47:32,607
- We're trying, people...
- Uh...

697
00:47:32,683 --> 00:47:35,277
- Excuse me.
- Shh!

698
00:47:35,352 --> 00:47:39,220
- Everybody! Excuse me.
- Shh!

699
00:47:39,289 --> 00:47:42,281
Um... hi.

700
00:47:42,359 --> 00:47:47,319
I know the situation
is way terrible and scary but I, um...

701
00:47:47,397 --> 00:47:52,460
See, I was wondering if I could fix it
so there was money for your paychecks.

702
00:47:52,536 --> 00:47:54,697
Shh! Quiet. Quiet, please.

703
00:47:54,771 --> 00:47:58,002
Please, let her finish.

704
00:47:59,743 --> 00:48:05,113
If I could do that, would you
keep on working until my dad gets back?

705
00:48:05,182 --> 00:48:08,310
Maybe, yeah.
But come on, you're a kid.

706
00:48:08,385 --> 00:48:12,321
Even you can't have
that kind of cash laying around.

707
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:16,086
I don't. But I think I can get it.

708
00:48:16,693 --> 00:48:20,561
How? By selling
your solid-gold sports car?

709
00:48:23,000 --> 00:48:26,697
Or auctioning off your collection
of designer handbags?

710
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,829
Since when do you care
what happens to us?

711
00:48:28,906 --> 00:48:30,498
Can I say what I was trying to say?

712
00:48:30,574 --> 00:48:35,409
Why? So we can make more sacrifices
to support your lifestyle?

713
00:48:35,479 --> 00:48:38,846
We don't need your pity, honey,
we need answers!

714
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,441
Don't pretend to relate to us.
You can't.

715
00:48:41,518 --> 00:48:45,614
Please! If you'll all go back to your jobs
and give me till the end of the day.

716
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,179
What if we don't trust you?

717
00:48:47,257 --> 00:48:50,249
You'd never work here
if your father didn't force you.

718
00:48:50,327 --> 00:48:56,027
Let's get real. You and your sister
are nothing but a pair of spoiled brats.

719
00:49:00,604 --> 00:49:02,595
You're right...

720
00:49:03,640 --> 00:49:05,631
about all of it.

721
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:11,109
But maybe that's why I'm trying to change.

722
00:49:21,358 --> 00:49:24,816
- Philippe! Hey.
- <i>Bonjour</i>. Courtney. How are you?

723
00:49:24,895 --> 00:49:29,696
I can't believe it's the first time we've
seen each other. I've been looking for you.

724
00:49:29,766 --> 00:49:32,599
For most of the day,
Ralph and I, we're on the road.

725
00:49:32,669 --> 00:49:36,969
Delivery guys.
Kinda goes with the turf, you know?

726
00:49:37,040 --> 00:49:41,670
- You're still coming to my party, right?
- Cannot wait.

727
00:49:41,745 --> 00:49:45,442
There's one thing
I should have mentioned the other night.

728
00:49:45,515 --> 00:49:50,316
See, since you said you'd be my...
my date, there's this...

729
00:49:50,387 --> 00:49:54,585
One big tradition at these parties is
a special deal called the Spotlight Dance.

730
00:49:54,658 --> 00:49:59,686
As in, all eyes are on the girls
being celebrated?

731
00:49:59,763 --> 00:50:04,860
Exactly. The four honorees and their dates,
out there in front of everybody.

732
00:50:04,935 --> 00:50:08,803
- Is that something you'd be cool with?
- Why I would not be?

733
00:50:08,872 --> 00:50:11,568
It can be a bit embarrassing.

734
00:50:11,641 --> 00:50:14,201
That is the beauty of being a foreigner.

735
00:50:14,277 --> 00:50:17,474
Everybody is a stranger,
so who care what they think?

736
00:50:17,547 --> 00:50:21,847
If you need for me
to dance with you, I dance.

737
00:50:21,918 --> 00:50:24,716
Great. Thanks.

738
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:27,120
Bye!

739
00:50:27,190 --> 00:50:30,159
All right, Romeo, get in the truck.

740
00:50:35,265 --> 00:50:38,291
Hm.

741
00:50:38,368 --> 00:50:40,632
What am I to do?
I need to make my rent.

742
00:50:40,704 --> 00:50:44,367
I know. We all do.
This is just a temporary situation, OK?

743
00:50:47,244 --> 00:50:49,303
Fran, do you know where my sister is?

744
00:50:49,379 --> 00:50:53,748
- She and Melvin had to run an errand.
- Oh, thanks.

745
00:50:53,817 --> 00:50:56,012
Don't worry, I promise you....

746
00:50:56,720 --> 00:51:00,986
- Thanks, ma'am. We're all done?
- Mm-hmm.

747
00:51:01,058 --> 00:51:05,256
Here you go.
Isn't it pretty?

748
00:51:05,328 --> 00:51:09,924
- Are you sure you want to do this?
- Totally.

749
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,468
You're a good girl, Taylor.

750
00:51:16,540 --> 00:51:20,567
Excuse me, folks.

751
00:51:20,644 --> 00:51:23,738
If I could just have
your attention for a minute.

752
00:51:23,814 --> 00:51:28,342
Due to the remarkable generosity
of our very own Taylor Callum...

753
00:51:28,418 --> 00:51:31,012
- And my sister Courtney.
- Yeah.

754
00:51:31,088 --> 00:51:34,785
...the current payroll has been guaranteed.

755
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:37,486
- All right!
- Whoo!

756
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:44,560
Melvin will be handing out your
reissued checks at the end of your shift.

757
00:51:46,303 --> 00:51:53,232
And, well, hopefully, this will tide us over
until Reed gets back. Thanks.

758
00:52:05,922 --> 00:52:07,651
- Joyce.
- Thank you.

759
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:10,090
- Taylor, talk to me.
- Not here.

760
00:52:10,160 --> 00:52:14,995
- Where did that money come from?
- We shouldn't talk about it till we're home.

761
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:21,429
l-I don't get it.
How could you do this to me?

762
00:52:21,505 --> 00:52:27,341
Courtney, I'm so, so sorry.
We really didn't have any other choice.

763
00:52:27,410 --> 00:52:31,312
Yes, we did.
It's my party budget, my money!

764
00:52:31,381 --> 00:52:34,111
The only reason Daddy
put your name on the account

765
00:52:34,184 --> 00:52:39,019
is because you're better at bank math.
You promised you weren't gonna touch it.

766
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:43,321
I know.
But then we got to work.

767
00:52:43,393 --> 00:52:47,022
You heard them. If the dairy goes under,
they might lose their houses.

768
00:52:47,097 --> 00:52:52,330
Their kids won't get to go to college.
It's serious stuff they're dealing with.

769
00:52:52,402 --> 00:52:54,370
Yeah, but we're only kids.

770
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:58,703
Why should it be up to us
to fix everybody's problems?

771
00:52:58,775 --> 00:53:05,578
Do you seriously even understand
half the stuff they're talking about?

772
00:53:05,649 --> 00:53:08,345
No. Not totally.

773
00:53:09,819 --> 00:53:12,811
But I know
we have some sort of a duty there.

774
00:53:12,889 --> 00:53:13,981
Maybe you do.

775
00:53:14,057 --> 00:53:17,857
My duty is to show up at work
and stay out of trouble like Daddy wanted.

776
00:53:17,928 --> 00:53:20,556
If you knew what was good for you,
that's what you'd do.

777
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:23,758
Look, I'll bet you can
still be a part of the party.

778
00:53:23,833 --> 00:53:27,633
- We'll talk to the other girls, compromise.
- Yeah, right.

779
00:53:27,704 --> 00:53:31,902
Sarah Van Dyke was dying to kick me out
for suggesting we switch to chicken.

780
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,877
- What if I explained the situation?
- You've done enough damage.

781
00:53:35,946 --> 00:53:38,608
I think this is what you wanted all along.

782
00:53:38,682 --> 00:53:41,708
If my party's wrecked,
everybody remembers yours as the best.

783
00:53:41,785 --> 00:53:46,518
Courtney, that's not true.
How could you even think that?

784
00:53:46,590 --> 00:53:48,990
I'm never speaking to you again!

785
00:53:49,059 --> 00:53:52,517
Courtney, come on! Courtney!

786
00:53:52,596 --> 00:53:56,327
Don't talk to me,
you horrible traitor! Go away!

787
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:39,072
- What do you want?
- I brought you your check.

788
00:54:39,142 --> 00:54:43,010
I told you to mail it.

789
00:54:43,079 --> 00:54:46,537
Jackson...

790
00:54:46,616 --> 00:54:50,484
The other night, I wanted to come over...

791
00:54:50,553 --> 00:54:55,217
But I fell asleep.
The whole working thing wiped me out.

792
00:54:55,292 --> 00:54:59,956
Considering how foreign it must be, I'm
surprised your body didn't go into shock.

793
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:02,328
Who knows?
Maybe it did.

794
00:55:12,075 --> 00:55:17,445
They're saying my truck's gonna be ready
day after tomorrow. How sweet is that?

795
00:55:19,849 --> 00:55:22,716
What are you doing?

796
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:25,584
What's wrong?

797
00:55:25,655 --> 00:55:28,317
Everything!

798
00:55:28,391 --> 00:55:33,124
My father's company's broke. Half the
people think he did horrible, terrible things.

799
00:55:33,196 --> 00:55:35,596
We've got no way to reach him.

800
00:55:36,366 --> 00:55:42,100
My one attempt to help ended up with my
sister thinking I'm an evil, devious witch.

801
00:55:44,341 --> 00:55:47,708
- Now she's not even speaking to me.
- Sounds bad.

802
00:55:51,581 --> 00:55:54,379
Wanna know the most pathetic part?

803
00:55:57,320 --> 00:56:01,757
The only person I could come up with
to unload on thinks I'm a spoiled brat.

804
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:05,226
A condescending spoiled brat.

805
00:56:05,295 --> 00:56:07,593
Right.

806
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:12,601
Jackson? Jackson! Come quick,
I need you. Martha's getting ready to calf.

807
00:56:12,669 --> 00:56:14,660
Let's go.

808
00:56:16,940 --> 00:56:21,809
I don't know what's wrong.
It was moving along, then it just stopped.

809
00:56:21,878 --> 00:56:25,746
- But her water bag broke, right?
- About ten minutes ago.

810
00:56:25,815 --> 00:56:29,216
- I think she's distracted.
- What?

811
00:56:29,285 --> 00:56:33,483
By that bull. She keeps eyeing him
like she'd prefer a little privacy.

812
00:56:33,556 --> 00:56:35,547
Taylor, cows aren't like people.

813
00:56:35,625 --> 00:56:37,115
Says you.

814
00:56:37,193 --> 00:56:41,562
Name one female in the universe who'd
want to be on display going through this.

815
00:56:50,607 --> 00:56:51,972
Shoo!

816
00:56:52,041 --> 00:56:55,067
Get out of here!
Shoo! Shoo!

817
00:56:55,145 --> 00:56:58,080
Get out of here.
Give poor mama cow a break.

818
00:57:00,283 --> 00:57:03,252
Hmph!

819
00:57:04,888 --> 00:57:06,719
OK.

820
00:57:10,727 --> 00:57:13,195
There, that's better, huh?

821
00:57:13,263 --> 00:57:17,199
Now you can push your little baby out
with some dignity.

822
00:57:19,636 --> 00:57:25,268
- She's doing it. She's pushing.
- Yeah. Here we go.

823
00:57:25,341 --> 00:57:27,241
That's my good cow.

824
00:57:27,310 --> 00:57:29,938
OK, OK. Here it comes.

825
00:57:30,013 --> 00:57:34,507
OK, OK. Here it comes.
Here it comes.

826
00:57:34,584 --> 00:57:35,778
Ha!

827
00:57:35,852 --> 00:57:37,752
Check it out.

828
00:57:37,821 --> 00:57:39,880
Well done, Martha.

829
00:57:39,956 --> 00:57:43,687
It's a girl,
just like we were hoping for.

830
00:57:43,760 --> 00:57:45,955
Look how cute she is.

831
00:57:48,298 --> 00:57:50,289
- Good job.
- Oh...

832
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:54,097
She's so sweet.

833
00:57:54,170 --> 00:57:58,436
Welcome to the world, little one. Oh!

834
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,712
I have to admit, I'm amazed
how great you were with Martha.

835
00:58:07,784 --> 00:58:11,083
What can I say?
We totally bonded.

836
00:58:11,154 --> 00:58:14,089
I never would have predicted that
in a million years.

837
00:58:14,157 --> 00:58:18,116
You should get to know a person
before you make judgments.

838
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,924
Sort of the way you did with me?

839
00:58:20,997 --> 00:58:23,795
Sort of how we both did.

840
00:58:41,618 --> 00:58:43,745
<i>Good morning. River City!</i>

841
00:58:43,820 --> 00:58:50,248
<i>Shake off those cobwebs. wipe the sleep</i>
<i>from your eyes. It's 5:30 in the morning!</i>

842
00:59:30,833 --> 00:59:37,170
Courtney, I know you're mad but, please?
We can still try to work out the party thing.

843
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:41,040
You've got the most important stuff -
your date, your fabulous dress...

844
00:59:41,110 --> 00:59:45,911
- Too bad I don't have a sister.
- Come on, can't we talk about this?

845
00:59:45,982 --> 00:59:50,646
No. You're not worthy. You can't talk about
my dress, you can't talk about Philippe.

846
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:53,655
You're not even
allowed to say the date anymore!

847
00:59:53,723 --> 00:59:59,252
For the rest of your ugly life, I want July 10
totally stricken from your vocabulary.

848
01:00:01,431 --> 01:00:05,925
What are you doing? That beeping means
you have to reset the expiration date.

849
01:00:06,002 --> 01:00:10,234
Don't worry about it, Thomas. I'm on it.

850
01:00:10,306 --> 01:00:12,900
<i>Expiration date reset.</i>

851
01:00:15,612 --> 01:00:18,445
You are never gonna believe
what's happening now.

852
01:00:18,514 --> 01:00:20,914
- The new checks didn't bounce...
- No.

853
01:00:20,984 --> 01:00:26,286
But I heard that yesterday, the storage silo
refrigeration system shut down.

854
01:00:26,356 --> 01:00:28,916
All our milk's gone bad.

855
01:00:28,992 --> 01:00:32,587
- Shouldn't someone have monitored that?
- Bob Fenwick. It was his job.

856
01:00:32,662 --> 01:00:37,156
But he was too busy robbing the company.
He didn't have time for anything else.

857
01:00:37,233 --> 01:00:39,633
It was Bob, not Reed, who took the money?

858
01:00:39,702 --> 01:00:45,641
Think about it, Thomas. Who always had
our best interests at heart and who didn't?

859
01:00:47,110 --> 01:00:51,604
Folks, let's focus on the present.
Without milk, or the money to pay for more,

860
01:00:51,681 --> 01:00:53,911
we can't fill any of the orders we have.

861
01:00:53,983 --> 01:00:55,541
So what do we do?

862
01:00:55,618 --> 01:00:59,281
We don't have a choice.
We finish the cycle we're in and shut down.

863
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,483
What happens to our accounts
awaiting deliveries this weekend?

864
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:07,860
I'll just have to start making some phone
calls and hopefully, they'll understand.

865
01:01:07,930 --> 01:01:09,830
- This is a disaster.
- Oh, yeah.

866
01:01:09,899 --> 01:01:13,096
Two or three weeks without work, I won't
keep up with my mortgage payments.

867
01:01:13,169 --> 01:01:16,935
We have no idea how we're gonna
send Charlie back to college this fall.

868
01:01:17,006 --> 01:01:20,237
Wait, what if I talked to Jackson Meade?

869
01:01:20,309 --> 01:01:23,244
Maybe his dad could give us milk
on credit for a few days.

870
01:01:23,312 --> 01:01:29,182
Our world doesn't work like that. Credit's
a luxury nobody in this industry can afford.

871
01:01:29,252 --> 01:01:31,743
Sarah, I still have $5000.

872
01:01:31,821 --> 01:01:36,918
If we all make a few sacrifices and
compromise, I'm sure we can work this out.

873
01:01:36,993 --> 01:01:40,895
Excuse me, is this a cotillion
or a charity event?

874
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:45,400
What do you expect me to do, pull money
out of thin air? I'm not a magician.

875
01:01:45,468 --> 01:01:48,904
I'd cry for you,
but I don't want my mascara to run.

876
01:01:48,971 --> 01:01:52,429
We have to pay the caterer
and the country club tonight.

877
01:01:52,508 --> 01:01:58,447
If you can't deliver your full share, then it
breaks my heart to tell you, but you're out.

878
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:01,176
Love you!

879
01:02:01,250 --> 01:02:03,013
I don't want that color.

880
01:02:04,987 --> 01:02:11,392
Well, I can at least ask, right? If he says no,
he says no, and we'll go from there.

881
01:02:11,461 --> 01:02:13,895
Congratulations! You win.

882
01:02:13,963 --> 01:02:18,093
I've officially been kicked out of
my own party. You must be thrilled.

883
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,133
I've gotta go.

884
01:02:22,805 --> 01:02:24,136
Whoa.

885
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:25,401
What's the deal?

886
01:02:25,475 --> 01:02:30,037
It's done,it's over. According to Sarah,
me minus my money equals bye-bye!

887
01:02:30,113 --> 01:02:35,210
OK, I'm really sorry, but have you not
been listening to anything this morning?

888
01:02:35,284 --> 01:02:37,309
It's only getting worse and worse.

889
01:02:37,386 --> 01:02:41,186
We've got all these great people
with their entire futures at stake.

890
01:02:41,257 --> 01:02:45,819
Without the cash to replace the spoiled
milk, everybody's gonna lose their jobs.

891
01:02:45,895 --> 01:02:51,060
And, I'm sorry,
this became my responsibility... when?

892
01:02:51,134 --> 01:02:53,227
You know, for once in your life,

893
01:02:53,302 --> 01:02:57,466
it might be nice to spend two seconds
thinking about somebody else!

894
01:02:57,540 --> 01:03:03,501
Why should I? I hate this place.
I don't care what Daddy wanted! I quit, OK?

895
01:03:14,557 --> 01:03:17,788
Taylor, that's not something
I can even ask my father.

896
01:03:17,860 --> 01:03:19,987
How come?

897
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:24,590
Look, my dad's a really good man -
too good. He'll help anybody in trouble.

898
01:03:24,667 --> 01:03:29,434
But that's no way to keep a small farm
like ours in business.

899
01:03:29,505 --> 01:03:35,535
If we take on one more dollar of debt,
it's gonna crush us.

900
01:03:35,611 --> 01:03:38,079
Can I say one thing?

901
01:03:38,147 --> 01:03:40,741
Living in the real world stinks.

902
01:03:45,288 --> 01:03:49,657
Heather, stop wiggling
so I can get this pinned.

903
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:51,420
Oh, no. Hide me.

904
01:03:51,494 --> 01:03:54,861
- It's just Courtney.
- Exactly.

905
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:56,962
Hello?

906
01:03:57,033 --> 01:04:00,628
Hey, honey, come on in.

907
01:04:02,171 --> 01:04:05,368
- How come you're not at work?
- Long story.

908
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,501
How do you like her party dress?

909
01:04:08,578 --> 01:04:11,342
I thought you found
something fabulous at Holly's.

910
01:04:11,414 --> 01:04:15,145
I did. We can't afford it.

911
01:04:15,218 --> 01:04:20,349
Who cares? This is gonna be
even better. It's perfect.

912
01:04:20,423 --> 01:04:22,516
That's exactly what I told her!

913
01:04:22,592 --> 01:04:24,958
- Mom, could you give us a minute?
- Um...

914
01:04:25,027 --> 01:04:28,019
I'll go get you girls some iced tea.

915
01:04:28,097 --> 01:04:30,827
Thanks.

916
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:34,826
You weren't supposed to see any of this.

917
01:04:34,904 --> 01:04:38,101
- It's so humiliating.
- What's the big deal?

918
01:04:38,174 --> 01:04:41,632
Are you kidding? You with your
"designer" this and "couture" that.

919
01:04:41,711 --> 01:04:44,475
Who cares?
It's not like we're in competition.

920
01:04:44,547 --> 01:04:48,278
Maybe it doesn't feel like that to you.
You get everything you want.

921
01:04:48,351 --> 01:04:51,377
It's hard for me, Courtney.
It always has been.

922
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:56,016
I love you, but, come on, do you ever
stop to think about anyone but yourself?

923
01:04:56,092 --> 01:04:58,788
- Oh, no.
- What?

924
01:04:58,861 --> 01:05:02,797
That's exactly what Taylor said.
Am I really that bad?

925
01:05:02,865 --> 01:05:08,030
Well, yeah, but why wouldn't you be?
Your whole life's been a total fairy tale.

926
01:05:08,104 --> 01:05:10,766
How are you supposed
to have a clue about reality?

927
01:05:10,840 --> 01:05:14,241
That doesn't mean I deserve
to act like some spoiled princess.

928
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:17,609
Who am I? Sarah? Yuck!

929
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,341
No, Court.

930
01:05:19,415 --> 01:05:22,851
Underneath, you're a really good person.

931
01:05:22,919 --> 01:05:24,978
Thanks.

932
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:29,388
But... I think it's time for me
to do better than that.

933
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:37,899
You're home early.

934
01:05:39,502 --> 01:05:41,527
Anything we need to talk about?

935
01:05:44,140 --> 01:05:46,506
I miss Mom.

936
01:05:46,575 --> 01:05:49,703
It doesn't seem fair, does it?

937
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:54,682
She just always knew the right thing to say.
Whenever me and Taylor were fighting,

938
01:05:54,750 --> 01:05:58,277
she was the only one
who could get us back together.

939
01:05:58,354 --> 01:06:00,879
She was that way with everybody.

940
01:06:00,957 --> 01:06:04,586
Your father used to call her
his secret weapon.

941
01:06:04,660 --> 01:06:09,688
And you know why? Because she had
compassion and she had perspective.

942
01:06:09,765 --> 01:06:15,635
She knew better than anybody that
her good life was just a happy accident.

943
01:06:15,705 --> 01:06:17,400
Yeah.

944
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:21,601
- Do you want some yogurt?
- Sure.

945
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,145
Your mom's recipe. Best one.

946
01:06:27,683 --> 01:06:30,709
I'm afraid we've come at this
from every possible angle

947
01:06:30,786 --> 01:06:33,880
and quite frankly,
there's no money, no milk.

948
01:06:33,956 --> 01:06:36,823
We're out of options.

949
01:06:36,892 --> 01:06:39,656
Unless...

950
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,720
Back in a flash!

951
01:06:45,267 --> 01:06:47,929
- Hey, Ralph.
- Hey, what's up?

952
01:06:48,004 --> 01:06:49,403
Well, um...

953
01:06:49,472 --> 01:06:52,873
My dad told me how much fun you had
restoring my mom's old Mustang,

954
01:06:52,942 --> 01:06:56,070
so I was wondering, do you wanna buy it?

955
01:06:56,145 --> 01:06:59,512
What? I thought you were
crazy about that car.

956
01:06:59,582 --> 01:07:04,144
I am. But considering the latest nightmare
here, I'm desperate for extra cash,

957
01:07:04,220 --> 01:07:07,451
and selling my car
is the only solution I can think of.

958
01:07:07,523 --> 01:07:11,084
Honestly, Taylor, as much as I'd love
to get my hands on that baby,

959
01:07:11,160 --> 01:07:13,390
it's just not anything I can afford.

960
01:07:13,462 --> 01:07:17,330
Please, Ralph.
You have no idea how important this is.

961
01:07:17,400 --> 01:07:19,891
Yeah, I get that.

962
01:07:19,969 --> 01:07:22,130
All I got is nine grand.

963
01:07:25,541 --> 01:07:27,202
I'll take it.

964
01:07:27,276 --> 01:07:29,267
Awesome!

965
01:07:32,882 --> 01:07:35,942
Here you go, Jackson.
This is a down payment.

966
01:07:38,754 --> 01:07:39,982
Wow.

967
01:07:40,056 --> 01:07:42,650
I can't believe you sold your car.

968
01:07:42,725 --> 01:07:44,659
Me neither.

969
01:07:44,727 --> 01:07:48,094
It really doesn't feel like I had a choice.

970
01:07:56,138 --> 01:07:59,471
Taylor!
I'm so glad you're home.

971
01:07:59,542 --> 01:08:02,568
Wait, you're actually speaking to me?

972
01:08:02,645 --> 01:08:05,705
Heather's dad said
the only reason the dairy's not closing

973
01:08:05,781 --> 01:08:09,273
is 'cause you sold your car
to get money to buy fresh milk.

974
01:08:09,351 --> 01:08:11,945
That's just a nasty rumor, right?

975
01:08:12,021 --> 01:08:16,117
Well, I just took the bus home.
What does that tell you?

976
01:08:16,192 --> 01:08:19,423
But you can't sell your car.
It's not right.

977
01:08:19,495 --> 01:08:22,362
Just tell me what I can do to help.

978
01:08:22,431 --> 01:08:26,959
Too late. You'd be better off putting
your time and energy into your party.

979
01:08:27,036 --> 01:08:31,735
Sarah and those girls don't care about me.
All they wanted was my money.

980
01:08:31,807 --> 01:08:36,267
Why would I even want to be a part
of their stupid party?

981
01:08:36,345 --> 01:08:38,711
Especially if I lose what I have with you.

982
01:08:38,781 --> 01:08:43,218
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

983
01:08:47,323 --> 01:08:50,952
Maybe we can use the rest of
my party budget to help us out.

984
01:08:51,026 --> 01:08:52,721
Sure.

985
01:08:52,795 --> 01:08:59,325
But, even with your 5000, we're
still 1000 short on the milk money.

986
01:09:00,035 --> 01:09:02,936
I think I have an idea. Come on!

987
01:09:05,141 --> 01:09:10,010
Since I haven't even worn it yet,
I'd like a full refund, please.

988
01:09:15,384 --> 01:09:16,510
Wow.

989
01:09:16,585 --> 01:09:22,251
I had no idea doing the right thing
could be so painful.

990
01:09:29,231 --> 01:09:32,758
- Hello?
- Bonjour, <i>Courtney. it's Philippe.</i>

991
01:09:32,835 --> 01:09:35,167
I know it is last minute,
but I was wondering,

992
01:09:35,237 --> 01:09:38,832
since we have this so-called
Dance of the Spotlight on Saturday,

993
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:43,311
<i>would you like to have dinner and practice</i>
<i>with me tonight at the country club?</i>

994
01:09:43,379 --> 01:09:45,643
The Millers invited you to be their guest.

995
01:09:45,714 --> 01:09:47,011
Uh, well, um...

996
01:09:47,082 --> 01:09:50,313
See, Philippe, I actually
need to talk to you about that.

997
01:09:50,386 --> 01:09:54,379
- Something is wrong?
- Very. I, uh...

998
01:09:54,456 --> 01:09:57,254
As it turns out,
I'm not gonna be a part of the cotillion.

999
01:09:57,326 --> 01:09:59,760
I, um... dropped out.

1000
01:09:59,828 --> 01:10:02,524
That is even more reason
for you to come with me.

1001
01:10:02,598 --> 01:10:08,002
If Saturday is not working, we'll create
our own spotlight to celebrate you tonight.

1002
01:10:08,070 --> 01:10:10,038
- Great.
- <i>Bye.</i>

1003
01:10:10,105 --> 01:10:12,096
Bye.

1004
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:35,127
It was so nice of you to invite me.
This is really fun.

1005
01:10:35,197 --> 01:10:39,566
It was all Philippe's idea.
He's quite taken with you, Courtney.

1006
01:10:39,635 --> 01:10:43,071
I'm blushing, aren't I?
How embarrassing is that?

1007
01:10:43,138 --> 01:10:47,040
- We should dance, no?
- We should dance, yes!

1008
01:10:47,109 --> 01:10:48,508
Will you excuse us?

1009
01:10:48,577 --> 01:10:53,105
As long as nobody's making me dance,
you're completely excused.

1010
01:11:02,992 --> 01:11:05,392
Wow. You really know
what you're doing.

1011
01:11:05,461 --> 01:11:08,589
I should. My parents
put me in lessons since I was ten.

1012
01:11:24,613 --> 01:11:26,478
Oh, no.

1013
01:11:27,583 --> 01:11:31,041
So it's true. Weston said
he thought he saw you here tonight.

1014
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:35,352
Given your desperate cries of poverty,
I'm amazed you can afford dinner.

1015
01:11:35,424 --> 01:11:39,690
I'm a guest... of the Millers.
May I help you with something?

1016
01:11:39,762 --> 01:11:42,287
Speaking of guests,
it's only fair to tell you,

1017
01:11:42,364 --> 01:11:46,596
we left word for the people on your list
letting them know they're dis-invited.

1018
01:11:46,669 --> 01:11:51,629
It was Sarah's idea. It was the only way
we could make up the budget deficit.

1019
01:11:51,707 --> 01:11:56,167
In case you care, turns out we're gonna
end up with every single thing we wanted,

1020
01:11:56,245 --> 01:11:58,873
despite that you nearly
sabotaged the event.

1021
01:11:58,947 --> 01:12:01,677
We convinced our dads
to kick in the extra dollars

1022
01:12:01,750 --> 01:12:04,810
and all it cost us
was a half an hour of crocodile tears.

1023
01:12:04,887 --> 01:12:08,721
- You must be so proud.
- Crab legs, oyster bar, steak, lobster,

1024
01:12:08,791 --> 01:12:10,884
the balloon arch, the ice sculpture...

1025
01:12:10,959 --> 01:12:14,395
Seems like the only thing
that won't be there is... you.

1026
01:12:14,463 --> 01:12:17,159
- Try not to be too heartbroken, Sarah.
- I won't.

1027
01:12:17,232 --> 01:12:20,360
If you'll excuse us,
Philippe and I have a dance to finish.

1028
01:12:20,436 --> 01:12:24,998
Twirl me, Philippe.
Twirl me now.

1029
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,509
Hey. Hi.
What are you doing here?

1030
01:12:36,585 --> 01:12:42,524
Judging by how you seemed buying the
milk, I thought you could use cheering up.

1031
01:12:42,591 --> 01:12:44,354
Come on in.

1032
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,361
So, explain to me this.

1033
01:12:49,431 --> 01:12:54,835
If those are the kind of girls
involved in this... cotillion,

1034
01:12:54,903 --> 01:12:59,397
why you wanted to be part
of it in the first place?

1035
01:12:59,475 --> 01:13:01,602
Wow, Philippe.

1036
01:13:01,677 --> 01:13:04,578
I honestly wish I could tell you.

1037
01:13:04,646 --> 01:13:09,413
I guess because it all looked
so glamorous and cool when Taylor did it.

1038
01:13:09,485 --> 01:13:11,453
Maybe that's the problem.

1039
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:16,822
I've spent so long trying to be my sister,
now I just need to be me.

1040
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:30,864
- <i>Did you make a speech?</i>
- <i>Yeah.</i>

1041
01:13:30,939 --> 01:13:32,770
<i>What did you say?</i>

1042
01:13:32,841 --> 01:13:36,572
<i>Well. you know</i> . <i>just the kind of things...</i>

1043
01:13:36,645 --> 01:13:40,809
You know what's so crazy
about this whole ordeal?

1044
01:13:40,883 --> 01:13:43,909
It's sure given me
a new appreciation for my dad.

1045
01:13:43,986 --> 01:13:45,010
I'll bet.

1046
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:47,715
The way he makes it all look so easy -

1047
01:13:47,790 --> 01:13:51,021
running the dairy,
taking care of me and Courtney...

1048
01:13:51,093 --> 01:13:54,722
He never even complains.

1049
01:13:54,797 --> 01:13:57,698
I sure wish he'd get home already.

1050
01:13:57,766 --> 01:14:01,293
Well, not right this second...

1051
01:14:01,370 --> 01:14:05,602
'cause then I wouldn't have
the nerve to do this.

1052
01:14:06,842 --> 01:14:08,833
Popcorn?

1053
01:14:22,858 --> 01:14:24,621
How's it going, girls?

1054
01:14:24,693 --> 01:14:27,253
Great. We're getting the hang of this gig.

1055
01:14:27,329 --> 01:14:28,694
Well, that's good.

1056
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:31,892
Uh, listen, I was wondering,
are you two busy tomorrow night?

1057
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:33,093
Not anymore.

1058
01:14:33,168 --> 01:14:37,696
Keith and I are having a "we can't believe
we survived this awful week" party

1059
01:14:37,773 --> 01:14:39,968
and we'd love it if you could be there.

1060
01:14:40,042 --> 01:14:41,270
Sounds fun.

1061
01:14:41,343 --> 01:14:44,369
The dairy band's gonna play,
everybody's bringing food...

1062
01:14:44,446 --> 01:14:48,405
- We're happy to bring sodas and cups.
- Excellent. My place, 7 pm.

1063
01:14:48,484 --> 01:14:49,610
'K!

1064
01:14:51,386 --> 01:14:55,083
# She couldn't sing to save her soul
didn't know a thing on the keys

1065
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:59,059
# She headed to the valley,
got a job at the creamery

1066
01:14:59,127 --> 01:15:02,858
# The girls made her welcome
and told her what to know

1067
01:15:02,931 --> 01:15:07,027
# About milk and cheese and real
ice cream, until the cows came home

1068
01:15:07,102 --> 01:15:12,938
# Now she's in the promised land
'cause she followed the beat of the band

1069
01:15:19,081 --> 01:15:21,948
Thank you.
Thank you.

1070
01:15:22,017 --> 01:15:27,148
Before we sing the next song, I just
wanted to say that, thanks to you all,

1071
01:15:27,222 --> 01:15:30,623
we're still in business.

1072
01:15:32,828 --> 01:15:38,198
And we couldn't have done it
without the amazing financial

1073
01:15:38,267 --> 01:15:42,033
and moral support of the Callum girls.

1074
01:15:46,074 --> 01:15:47,302
Yeah.

1075
01:15:48,777 --> 01:15:53,771
Some of you may not know this, but tonight
was supposed to be Courtney's cotillion.

1076
01:15:53,849 --> 01:15:58,218
Who cares?
I'd much rather be here with all of you!

1077
01:15:58,287 --> 01:15:59,777
Fair enough.

1078
01:15:59,855 --> 01:16:06,090
But after everything you've done, you
should get to have your Spotlight Dance.

1079
01:16:06,161 --> 01:16:07,355
- You ready?
- Yeah.

1080
01:16:07,429 --> 01:16:08,555
OK.

1081
01:16:08,630 --> 01:16:12,726
A-one, two, a-one, two, three.

1082
01:16:12,801 --> 01:16:16,601
Folks, folks!
Sorry to interrupt.

1083
01:16:16,672 --> 01:16:19,004
We've got an emergency.

1084
01:16:20,909 --> 01:16:25,141
I don't understand. How could all the
products we made this week be expired?

1085
01:16:25,213 --> 01:16:26,908
That's the point.
They're not.

1086
01:16:26,982 --> 01:16:30,315
Somewhere, the date stamp
was incorrectly set.

1087
01:16:30,385 --> 01:16:35,880
The first two accounts I stopped at tonight
refused delivery. Yogurt, cheese - all of it.

1088
01:16:35,958 --> 01:16:37,721
Couldn't you explain it was a mistake?

1089
01:16:37,793 --> 01:16:42,127
It's not that easy. Who is gonna wanna
buy something they think has gone bad?

1090
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,961
Couldn't we put new lids on
with the right date?

1091
01:16:45,033 --> 01:16:49,595
Health Code regulations prohibit a product
from being sold once it's been resealed.

1092
01:16:49,671 --> 01:16:56,099
We'd have to start a whole new run from
scratch or lose at least 14 major accounts.

1093
01:16:57,646 --> 01:17:00,046
How could this have happened?

1094
01:17:02,784 --> 01:17:04,251
It was me.

1095
01:17:06,355 --> 01:17:09,654
The day when I was mad at you
about getting exiled from my party.

1096
01:17:09,725 --> 01:17:12,888
That's the date
I must have accidentally set.

1097
01:17:12,961 --> 01:17:15,191
<i>Expiration date reset.</i>

1098
01:17:15,263 --> 01:17:20,030
Today. The whole entire dairy
is gonna crash and burn because of me.

1099
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:21,091
Whoa, whoa.

1100
01:17:21,169 --> 01:17:23,637
But we can salvage this, right?

1101
01:17:23,705 --> 01:17:27,766
What if we started the run right now?
We're all here. We could all pitch in.

1102
01:17:27,843 --> 01:17:31,370
Except for the fact that
we're almost out of milk again.

1103
01:17:31,446 --> 01:17:32,879
I could fix that.

1104
01:17:32,948 --> 01:17:36,315
- Dad, no. How can we afford it?
- We can't afford not to help.

1105
01:17:36,385 --> 01:17:40,446
If the dairy goes belly-up,
we lose their business and half our income.

1106
01:17:40,522 --> 01:17:43,013
So let's get moving.

1107
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,116
Not so fast!

1108
01:17:45,193 --> 01:17:51,223
Even if everybody works, we don't have
the manpower for an all-inventory run.

1109
01:17:51,299 --> 01:17:53,824
We'd have to get
machines going double-time,

1110
01:17:53,902 --> 01:17:57,599
we'd need people unloading
and reloading the fleet of trucks....

1111
01:17:57,673 --> 01:18:01,473
Unless you've got
25 extra bodies, it's impossible.

1112
01:18:01,543 --> 01:18:05,980
He's right. Simply wanting
to make it happen is not enough.

1113
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:11,743
Hold on. I know where
we can get more volunteers.

1114
01:18:11,820 --> 01:18:16,154
Get down to the dairy and get started.
Taylor and I will meet you there soon.

1115
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:17,589
Let's go.

1116
01:18:20,062 --> 01:18:22,428
# I don't wanna grow up

1117
01:18:22,497 --> 01:18:25,091
# Don't wanna figure this out

1118
01:18:25,167 --> 01:18:27,897
# I know you set me up

1119
01:18:27,969 --> 01:18:31,029
# Don't want this dragging you down

1120
01:18:31,106 --> 01:18:33,370
# I don't wanna grow up

1121
01:18:33,442 --> 01:18:36,138
# Don't wanna figure this out

1122
01:18:36,211 --> 01:18:39,271
# I know you set me up

1123
01:18:39,347 --> 01:18:44,410
# Don't want this dragging you down
Don't want this dragging you down

1124
01:18:44,486 --> 01:18:47,148
# Don't want to figure out

1125
01:18:47,222 --> 01:18:51,056
# Don't wanna see you around

1126
01:18:51,126 --> 01:18:55,859
# One more time

1127
01:18:56,998 --> 01:18:59,626
- Sorry to interrupt. Can I borrow your mic?
- Yeah.

1128
01:18:59,701 --> 01:19:03,137
What do you think you're doing?
You're not welcome here.

1129
01:19:03,205 --> 01:19:05,673
I know.
But I'm desperate.

1130
01:19:05,741 --> 01:19:08,437
So what else is new?

1131
01:19:08,510 --> 01:19:11,104
Um... Hi.

1132
01:19:11,179 --> 01:19:15,673
You guys,
can you please listen a minute?

1133
01:19:15,751 --> 01:19:21,018
I know I have no right to ask this,
but my father's dairy is in horrible trouble.

1134
01:19:21,089 --> 01:19:26,527
If we don't get extra help, a lot of wonderful,
hardworking people will lose their jobs.

1135
01:19:26,595 --> 01:19:28,586
And we care... why?

1136
01:19:28,663 --> 01:19:31,029
- Because you should.
- Hmph.

1137
01:19:31,099 --> 01:19:34,125
Because we're all part
of the same community.

1138
01:19:34,202 --> 01:19:40,141
Look, until a few days ago...
I was just like all of you.

1139
01:19:40,208 --> 01:19:44,008
I didn't know, I didn't care.

1140
01:19:44,079 --> 01:19:48,140
But I've learned stuff.
Everybody in this room is so lucky.

1141
01:19:48,216 --> 01:19:52,983
And it's just an accident of birth. We have
no clue what most people are up against.

1142
01:19:53,054 --> 01:19:57,514
But it's not too late to learn.
It feels really good to help other people.

1143
01:19:57,592 --> 01:20:00,026
It's an amazing rush
to give something back.

1144
01:20:00,095 --> 01:20:03,792
That's good, because you know
what you can give back? The microphone!

1145
01:20:03,865 --> 01:20:07,961
Sarah, no! There's more to life
than balloon arches and ice sculptures.

1146
01:20:08,036 --> 01:20:10,300
- Give it back!
- No, give it back to me!

1147
01:20:10,372 --> 01:20:13,933
No! I want it now!
Sarah, give me the microphone!

1148
01:20:24,319 --> 01:20:26,981
The dessert parade!

1149
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:37,931
Oh, créme brulée.

1150
01:20:41,336 --> 01:20:44,271
OK, everybody.
I need you to bring this in.

1151
01:20:53,515 --> 01:20:55,278
OK.

1152
01:20:55,350 --> 01:20:57,147
- OK.
- There's one.

1153
01:20:57,219 --> 01:20:59,210
All right.

1154
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,883
All right, good job, guys.

1155
01:21:05,293 --> 01:21:08,387
I don't get it.
How could I have failed?

1156
01:21:08,463 --> 01:21:11,955
You didn't. You were awesome.
I would have followed you anywhere.

1157
01:21:12,033 --> 01:21:15,799
Because you're not a pathetic
Sarah clone. Did you see those zombies?

1158
01:21:15,871 --> 01:21:22,367
Inhale, exhale. Even without those losers,
there has to be a way we can get this done.

1159
01:21:22,444 --> 01:21:24,537
Where are your friends?

1160
01:21:24,613 --> 01:21:26,638
Lost in their own little worlds.

1161
01:21:26,715 --> 01:21:29,411
- So they're not coming?
- No.

1162
01:21:30,852 --> 01:21:32,183
It's over.

1163
01:21:32,254 --> 01:21:33,881
So what do we do now?

1164
01:21:33,955 --> 01:21:38,119
I'm afraid we have to send everyone home.
OK, guys. Shut it down.

1165
01:21:38,193 --> 01:21:40,252
Let's power down.

1166
01:21:40,328 --> 01:21:43,297
Did I hear this place
could use a little help?

1167
01:21:43,365 --> 01:21:44,423
Daddy!

1168
01:21:47,903 --> 01:21:50,235
You're here!
You're home!

1169
01:21:50,305 --> 01:21:53,399
With a whole group
of your friends to pitch in, too.

1170
01:21:53,475 --> 01:21:56,342
But you, with them... How?

1171
01:21:56,411 --> 01:22:01,542
I was on my trip, missing you two, realizing
where I really wanted to be was home,

1172
01:22:01,616 --> 01:22:03,811
so I came back.

1173
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:07,821
When I went to look for you at the club,
this whole crew pounced on me.

1174
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:13,919
After you left, we were all, like,
"Wow, what Courtney said was so right.

1175
01:22:13,995 --> 01:22:16,759
We have to get outside ourselves
and help people."

1176
01:22:16,831 --> 01:22:21,234
And then your sweet dad showed up,
so confused and out of the loop.

1177
01:22:21,303 --> 01:22:25,103
We gave him the headlines,
and here we are, reporting for duty.

1178
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:28,506
- Let's get busy here.
- Let's get back to work.

1179
01:22:28,576 --> 01:22:30,203
Come on.

1180
01:22:30,278 --> 01:22:32,644
<i># Wake up every morning</i>
<i>from your alarm clock warning</i>

1181
01:22:32,714 --> 01:22:35,808
<i># Take the 8:15 into the city</i>

1182
01:22:35,884 --> 01:22:39,012
<i># There's a whistle up above</i>

1183
01:22:39,087 --> 01:22:42,022
<i># And the girls who try to look pretty</i>

1184
01:22:42,090 --> 01:22:45,491

1185
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:48,529

1186

1187
01:22:52,067 --> 01:22:54,797

1188
01:22:54,869 --> 01:22:58,361

1195
01:23:27,202 --> 01:23:31,263
<i># Takin' care of business</i>

1196
01:23:31,339 --> 01:23:34,706
Well, troops,
against all odds, we pulled this off.

1197
01:23:40,015 --> 01:23:43,348
I don't know how I'll ever
be able to thank you enough.

1198
01:23:43,418 --> 01:23:48,253
Tomorrow I'll figure out
how much damage Bob Fenwick did.

1199
01:23:48,323 --> 01:23:54,489
But tonight, I want you to know, as long as
I'm in business, every one of you has a job.

1200
01:23:54,562 --> 01:23:56,962
You're the best!

1201
01:24:02,237 --> 01:24:04,705
To my own Taylor and Courtney...

1202
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:08,869
Thank you, girls...
from the bottom of my heart.

1203
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:12,538
You really came through
when it mattered the most.

1204
01:24:12,614 --> 01:24:14,172
Thanks.

1205
01:24:18,353 --> 01:24:21,880
Now, before I send you all home
for a well-earned sleep,

1206
01:24:21,956 --> 01:24:26,359
I'm told there's still
one last thing we have to do, so...

1207
01:24:26,428 --> 01:24:29,090
Courtney, Philippe,

1208
01:24:29,164 --> 01:24:33,362
it's time for your spotlight dance.

1209
01:24:55,690 --> 01:25:01,253
# I believe you can shine

1210
01:25:01,329 --> 01:25:03,695
# If you have to grab the stars

1211
01:25:03,765 --> 01:25:06,290
# Right out of the sky

1212
01:25:06,367 --> 01:25:09,097
# Don't look back

1213
01:25:09,170 --> 01:25:11,331
# Close your eyes

1214
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:17,675
# Sometimes you have to see it
from your heart to get it right

1215
01:25:17,745 --> 01:25:20,839
# Sooner or later
when the dust has cleared

1216
01:25:20,915 --> 01:25:23,713
# The sun comes out,
you're still here

1217
01:25:23,785 --> 01:25:28,347
# Look at what you've found

1218
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:32,223
# Figure it out,
it's simple when you think about it

1219
01:25:32,293 --> 01:25:34,761
# Who you are inside

1220
01:25:34,829 --> 01:25:37,093
# Let it out

1221
01:25:37,165 --> 01:25:42,102
# Everything you wanna be
is coming around

1222
01:25:42,170 --> 01:25:47,130
# It's all good now

1223
01:25:47,208 --> 01:25:52,339
# It all works out

1224
01:25:52,413 --> 01:25:56,406
# You'll see it all

1225
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:59,453
# Comes down

1226
01:25:59,521 --> 01:26:02,388
# To taking chances, living life

1227
01:26:02,457 --> 01:26:05,620
# Just in time to get it right

1228
01:26:05,693 --> 01:26:08,719
# Sooner or later
when the dust has cleared

1229
01:26:08,796 --> 01:26:11,594
# The sun comes out,
you're still here

1230
01:26:11,666 --> 01:26:16,603
# Look at what you've found

1231
01:26:16,671 --> 01:26:20,937
# It's all good now

1232
01:26:31,452 --> 01:26:32,976
How's it going?

1233
01:26:33,054 --> 01:26:35,852
Well, we'll survive.... barely.

1234
01:26:35,924 --> 01:26:38,518
- It's really that bad?
- Yep.

1235
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:42,962
Money's gone. It's basically like
we're starting over.

1236
01:26:43,031 --> 01:26:47,934
I'm so sorry, Daddy. How could he
do that? You were his best friend!

1237
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:50,095
Greed's a funny thing, girls.

1238
01:26:50,171 --> 01:26:53,800
Has a way of getting
the best of some people.

1239
01:26:53,875 --> 01:26:55,809
It's all so evil.

1240
01:26:55,877 --> 01:26:59,711
We're definitely in for some
serious belt-tightening around here.

1241
01:26:59,781 --> 01:27:03,581
No vacations, no more country clubs,
no shopping sprees.

1242
01:27:05,987 --> 01:27:09,718
It's gonna be OK.
We can do this.

1243
01:27:09,791 --> 01:27:11,691
For sure.

1244
01:27:11,759 --> 01:27:15,024
But we can still
buy new school shoes, right?

1245
01:27:15,096 --> 01:27:17,326
Just one pair each?

1246
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:21,401
What?

1247
01:27:21,469 --> 01:27:23,164
We'll see.

1248
01:27:25,273 --> 01:27:26,604
- OK...
- Be strong, Court.

1249
01:27:26,674 --> 01:27:29,074
- Yeah.
- Be strong.

1250
01:27:29,143 --> 01:27:31,270
It's OK.

1251
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:41,654
- Thanks for breakfast.
- No girls this morning?

1252
01:27:41,723 --> 01:27:44,487
I snuck into their rooms
and shut off their alarms.

1253
01:27:44,559 --> 01:27:48,928
All things considered,
I figure they deserve a few days off.

1254
01:27:48,997 --> 01:27:52,160
I'm gonna grab my briefcase
and I'm outta here. Have a good day.

1255
01:27:52,233 --> 01:27:53,598
Bye-bye.

1256
01:27:56,070 --> 01:27:57,731
- Girls?
- Hey, Daddy.

1257
01:27:57,805 --> 01:27:59,739
Just the guy we were about to look for.

1258
01:27:59,807 --> 01:28:02,298
What are you doing?
I was gonna let you sleep in.

1259
01:28:02,377 --> 01:28:05,778
- Sleep in? No way.
- OK, what's going on?

1260
01:28:05,847 --> 01:28:10,250
- You're not gonna believe what we found.
- Not "we," "you."

1261
01:28:10,318 --> 01:28:13,754
I don't know how she does it,
but before we ever left the dairy,

1262
01:28:13,821 --> 01:28:17,450
Courtney got into Bob's computer
and retrieved his hard drive. Genius!

1263
01:28:18,493 --> 01:28:21,929
I found his plane reservations
for two to the Cayman Islands.

1264
01:28:21,996 --> 01:28:25,727
And I found out where he's staying.
Check this out.

1265
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:31,766
- Live on streaming video!
- Oh, man!

1266
01:28:31,839 --> 01:28:35,468
I'm doing an auto save
so you can turn it over to the FBI.

1267
01:28:35,543 --> 01:28:38,205
Nice job, ladies.

1268
01:28:38,279 --> 01:28:41,442
I'm gonna call them
as soon as I get to work.

1269
01:28:41,516 --> 01:28:45,475
Wait! You can't go without us!
Just give us two seconds to change.

1270
01:28:45,553 --> 01:28:48,681
- Don't you want to get some sleep?
- Are you kidding?

1271
01:28:48,756 --> 01:28:51,850
If we're at the dairy,
that's eight hours we can't be at the mall.

1272
01:28:51,926 --> 01:28:54,861
That's a very good point. Let's go.
