1
00:00:48,014 --> 00:00:49,038
Strike.

2
00:00:55,255 --> 00:00:56,244
One out.

3
00:01:08,268 --> 00:01:10,259
-Strike three.
-No way.

4
00:01:24,551 --> 00:01:26,109
-I got it.
-I got it.

5
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:34,885
Get your heads in the game!

6
00:01:45,905 --> 00:01:47,634
You're gonna let him kill the kid?

7
00:02:11,798 --> 00:02:13,026
Check out Sugar.

8
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:16,630
He put on 20 pounds,
and now he's going for 20 more.

9
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:21,672
All muscle, dude.
Rock solid.

10
00:02:22,742 --> 00:02:24,232
Right... solid bones!

11
00:02:27,180 --> 00:02:29,842
Eat slowly, kid.
It's not going anywhere!

12
00:02:32,952 --> 00:02:36,217
If you hustled as hard as him,
you'd be hungry too.

13
00:02:41,761 --> 00:02:43,490
-I got it. I got it.
-I got it.

14
00:02:43,863 --> 00:02:45,990
-Fly ball.
-Fly ball.

15
00:02:46,065 --> 00:02:48,499
-Line drive.
-Line drive.

16
00:02:48,568 --> 00:02:50,661
-Ground ball.
-Ground ball.

17
00:02:50,737 --> 00:02:52,762
-Ground ball.
-Ground ball.

18
00:02:52,839 --> 00:02:54,932
-Home run.
-Home run.

19
00:02:55,008 --> 00:02:57,340
-Home run.
-Home run.

20
00:02:57,410 --> 00:02:58,707
Home run.

21
00:03:32,645 --> 00:03:33,737
What about this kid?

22
00:03:33,813 --> 00:03:37,180
Salvador Torres?
He's been with us for about a week.

23
00:03:37,517 --> 00:03:39,485
Good potential. Raw talent.

24
00:03:41,020 --> 00:03:42,578
We gonna sign him?

25
00:03:42,655 --> 00:03:46,352
Soon, I hope. I'm talking to his agent.
They got two other offers.

26
00:03:46,426 --> 00:03:48,553
From two other teams for about a hundred.

27
00:03:49,762 --> 00:03:51,024
He's good.

28
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,697
What about him?

29
00:03:56,769 --> 00:03:58,361
Miguel Santos?

30
00:03:58,671 --> 00:04:02,129
Great arm.
We signed him two year ago for 15.

31
00:04:02,208 --> 00:04:04,142
Good deal. He throw any junk?

32
00:04:04,210 --> 00:04:06,872
Sugar, show him your curve.

33
00:04:15,521 --> 00:04:18,081
Not bad. Mind if I try something?

34
00:04:18,157 --> 00:04:19,146
Please, go ahead.

35
00:04:19,225 --> 00:04:20,817
Do you mind? May l?

36
00:04:22,028 --> 00:04:23,154
Give him the ball.

37
00:04:25,298 --> 00:04:26,788
It's a spike curve.

38
00:04:28,001 --> 00:04:30,765
Gives you more rotation, more movement.

39
00:04:31,037 --> 00:04:32,265
You try.

40
00:04:33,673 --> 00:04:34,867
This way.

41
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:38,675
Yeah. Just like that. Come on, let's go.

42
00:04:41,114 --> 00:04:42,138
Throw it!

43
00:04:51,824 --> 00:04:55,760
It's okay, son. These things take time.
You'll figure it out.

44
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:56,988
He'll be all right.

45
00:05:01,234 --> 00:05:03,668
-Your performance...
-Your performance...

46
00:05:03,736 --> 00:05:05,499
-ln the mound...
-ln the mound...

47
00:05:05,571 --> 00:05:07,095
-ls not...
-ls not...

48
00:05:07,173 --> 00:05:08,538
-As good...
-As good...

49
00:05:08,608 --> 00:05:10,667
-As last year.
-As last year.

50
00:05:10,743 --> 00:05:12,472
-What is the problem?
-What is the problem?

51
00:05:12,545 --> 00:05:14,638
-What is the problem?
-What is the problem?

52
00:05:14,714 --> 00:05:16,375
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

53
00:05:16,449 --> 00:05:18,041
-I don't know.
-I don't know.

54
00:05:18,117 --> 00:05:20,381
-Maybe my mechanic.
-Maybe my mechanic.

55
00:05:20,453 --> 00:05:22,478
-Maybe my mechanic.
-Maybe my mechanic.

56
00:05:22,555 --> 00:05:25,115
-I want to give you a chance.
-I want to give you a chance.

57
00:05:25,191 --> 00:05:27,716
-I want to give you a chance.
-I want to give you a chance.

58
00:05:27,794 --> 00:05:30,024
-It's up to you.
-It's up to you.

59
00:05:30,096 --> 00:05:32,064
-It's up to you.
-It's up to you.

60
00:05:32,131 --> 00:05:33,826
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

61
00:05:35,001 --> 00:05:36,491
-Thank you.
-Thank you.

62
00:05:36,569 --> 00:05:38,833
-I'll do my best.
-I'll do my best.

63
00:05:38,905 --> 00:05:41,305
-I'll do my best.
-I'll do my best.

64
00:05:41,374 --> 00:05:43,672
-I'll do my best.
-I'll do my best.

65
00:05:47,947 --> 00:05:50,074
-Have a good weekend.
-You too.

66
00:07:15,835 --> 00:07:18,167
Sugar! Give me a ball!

67
00:07:18,237 --> 00:07:19,966
Hey, what's up?

68
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:33,942
-I got one!
-I got one!

69
00:07:35,087 --> 00:07:37,146
-Hi, Sis.
-Hello.

70
00:07:38,458 --> 00:07:41,916
-Any news about the States?
-ls that all you want to hear about?

71
00:07:44,330 --> 00:07:46,355
Hi, Grandma.
Looking beautiful today.

72
00:07:46,432 --> 00:07:48,366
What's up? How's the TV?

73
00:07:48,434 --> 00:07:50,129
Erica won't let me watch baseball.

74
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,365
Not during American Idol.

75
00:07:52,839 --> 00:07:55,967
Hello, Miguel. Do you have
any good news for your mother?

76
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:57,134
Yes...

77
00:07:57,210 --> 00:07:58,677
You're going to the States?

78
00:07:58,744 --> 00:08:00,371
Not yet, Mom.

79
00:08:00,446 --> 00:08:03,006
But I learned
how to throw a spike curve.

80
00:08:03,082 --> 00:08:04,174
A spike curve...

81
00:08:04,817 --> 00:08:06,079
What's that?

82
00:08:16,929 --> 00:08:19,090
I'm still working out the mechanics!

83
00:08:31,277 --> 00:08:33,245
When are you going to finish this?

84
00:08:33,779 --> 00:08:37,237
Soon. It's just hard
to find the time.

85
00:08:37,316 --> 00:08:38,840
It's pretty.

86
00:08:39,685 --> 00:08:43,280
I'm trying to match the chairs
my dad made, but I can't get it right.

87
00:08:43,456 --> 00:08:45,788
I think it's perfect.

88
00:08:46,859 --> 00:08:49,453
When I'm done,
I'll make you one just like it.

89
00:08:50,296 --> 00:08:52,856
And the rest of the house?
When will it be done?

90
00:08:53,833 --> 00:08:55,767
A month, maybe two...

91
00:08:56,102 --> 00:08:59,230
Do you know we just did it
where my mom's kitchen is gonna be?

92
00:09:00,139 --> 00:09:02,004
Don't tell me that!

93
00:09:02,141 --> 00:09:05,907
Why not? Next time we can do it
in Grandma's bedroom.

94
00:09:08,514 --> 00:09:11,278
Or we could do it on the roof?

95
00:09:14,453 --> 00:09:17,115
I hope you make it to the States.

96
00:09:17,189 --> 00:09:20,750
You hope?
Baby, there's nobody better than me.

97
00:09:21,327 --> 00:09:23,454
Okay, then...

98
00:09:23,529 --> 00:09:25,463
how about...

99
00:09:25,731 --> 00:09:27,323
I know you'll make it.

100
00:09:27,466 --> 00:09:29,161
Now we're talking.

101
00:09:29,835 --> 00:09:32,565
And the first thing
I'm going to do when I get there...

102
00:09:32,672 --> 00:09:34,936
I'm going to buy a Cadillac.

103
00:09:35,141 --> 00:09:38,133
And I'll drive it through
the ocean and bring you back with me.

104
00:09:38,210 --> 00:09:41,179
You can't drive a Cadillac on water.

105
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,943
Sure you can.
In the U.S. they build all kinds of cars.

106
00:09:45,051 --> 00:09:47,576
Ones that drive on water.

107
00:09:47,653 --> 00:09:49,143
You're crazy.

108
00:09:49,322 --> 00:09:50,949
I can take you to New York.

109
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,957
There's snow there
in Yankee Stadium.

110
00:09:53,025 --> 00:09:54,652
Want to see me play
in Yankee Stadium?

111
00:09:54,760 --> 00:09:58,924
It doesn't snow during
the baseball season, silly.

112
00:09:59,031 --> 00:10:01,522
So we'll go for Christmas.

113
00:10:03,336 --> 00:10:04,769
Promise?

114
00:10:04,937 --> 00:10:06,131
Sure. Next Christmas...

115
00:10:06,205 --> 00:10:09,106
we'll cross the sea
in my Cadillac car-boat. Done.

116
00:10:09,175 --> 00:10:11,575
You really are crazy.

117
00:10:17,583 --> 00:10:21,019
She was hot.
But I liked my hair too much.

118
00:10:21,087 --> 00:10:23,248
I liked it too, Javi.

119
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:28,652
If you liked your hair
so much, why did you cut it?

120
00:10:28,761 --> 00:10:31,457
I wanted a different look.

121
00:10:31,597 --> 00:10:33,292
Or a different girl.

122
00:10:35,568 --> 00:10:37,001
Hey, stop playing...

123
00:10:37,069 --> 00:10:39,196
This arm is worth a million dollars.

124
00:10:39,271 --> 00:10:41,569
He's right!
That arm's worth money.

125
00:10:41,641 --> 00:10:43,768
May God bless the golden arm!

126
00:10:43,843 --> 00:10:46,038
You call that flabby
rubber band an arm?

127
00:10:46,112 --> 00:10:47,602
Oh, Miguel!

128
00:10:48,014 --> 00:10:51,609
Dude, this arm throws a 95.
What does yours throw?

129
00:10:52,351 --> 00:10:54,876
Well, I threw 98
in Double-A in Portland.

130
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,649
-98?
-That's right.

131
00:10:56,722 --> 00:10:58,917
Then why are you at the streetlights...

132
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:01,323
selling cell phone chargers?

133
00:11:02,662 --> 00:11:05,153
And the one you sold me
doesn't even work.

134
00:12:33,586 --> 00:12:36,612
Many of you are thinking
about your families.

135
00:12:38,190 --> 00:12:39,623
Your girlfriends.

136
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:42,386
Your siblings.

137
00:12:43,462 --> 00:12:44,451
Your grandparents.

138
00:12:46,165 --> 00:12:49,100
I know a lot of you
are feeling the pressure.

139
00:12:52,104 --> 00:12:54,766
But I'm going to tell you
something very important.

140
00:12:55,541 --> 00:12:57,600
Forget about it all.

141
00:12:58,944 --> 00:13:02,471
The only thing you've got
to think about is yourselves.

142
00:13:03,616 --> 00:13:06,107
Put all your energy into your game...

143
00:13:06,385 --> 00:13:08,717
into your development
as a ballplayer.

144
00:13:09,755 --> 00:13:12,053
Forget about everything else.

145
00:13:12,124 --> 00:13:14,217
And just play.

146
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:17,155
You want to succeed?

147
00:13:17,863 --> 00:13:22,300
You've got to be like a racehorse,
focused on your final goal.

148
00:13:23,202 --> 00:13:24,999
Because everything...

149
00:13:25,070 --> 00:13:29,598
absolutely everything
depends on you.

150
00:14:15,421 --> 00:14:19,653
Berroa. When you finish,
go to Alvarez's office.

151
00:14:42,514 --> 00:14:44,880
Hey, Sugar,
they made me an offer.

152
00:14:45,818 --> 00:14:48,514
Congratulations.
What did they offer you?

153
00:14:48,587 --> 00:14:50,555
A hundred fifteen.

154
00:14:51,724 --> 00:14:55,421
But my agent takes like forty of it.

155
00:14:55,494 --> 00:14:57,189
How much did you sign for?

156
00:14:58,564 --> 00:15:00,657
Oh, you know.
About the same.

157
00:15:01,400 --> 00:15:02,992
Did you get any other offers?

158
00:15:03,068 --> 00:15:05,969
The Yankees and Seattle,
but not as much.

159
00:15:06,238 --> 00:15:11,471
Well, just don't get cocky.
Nobody likes a dickhead on the team.

160
00:15:11,543 --> 00:15:13,067
Welcome to the team.

161
00:15:22,721 --> 00:15:24,848
So, why do they call you Sugar?

162
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:28,451
Well, I'm sweet with the ladies.

163
00:15:28,527 --> 00:15:31,792
But mostly I've got
the sweetest knuckle curve there is.

164
00:15:31,864 --> 00:15:35,163
Bullshit! You just learned
that the other day.

165
00:15:35,701 --> 00:15:37,794
They call him Sugar because
he eats so much dessert!

166
00:15:39,939 --> 00:15:41,406
He's just jealous.

167
00:15:54,586 --> 00:15:57,214
Dude, we got you
a little going away present.

168
00:16:09,134 --> 00:16:10,624
You should go to the Dodgers.

169
00:16:10,736 --> 00:16:12,761
I heard they're looking
for first basemen.

170
00:16:13,172 --> 00:16:15,504
To hell with that shit.

171
00:16:15,741 --> 00:16:18,232
The coaches are
even tougher over there.

172
00:16:19,445 --> 00:16:21,003
No more curfews.

173
00:16:21,080 --> 00:16:23,742
No more trainers telling me
what to do and how to do it.

174
00:16:24,283 --> 00:16:26,410
I feel good like this, man.

175
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:28,316
Forget about it.

176
00:16:34,259 --> 00:16:36,625
"No hats inside the building, son!"

177
00:16:36,996 --> 00:16:40,557
"Cut your meat with the knife,
but eat it with the fork!"

178
00:16:40,799 --> 00:16:43,427
"Never put the meat
in your mouth with the knife!"

179
00:16:43,502 --> 00:16:45,993
"Or you'll chop off your tongue!"

180
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:48,266
"Ten o'clock! Lights out!"

181
00:16:48,340 --> 00:16:49,705
Line drive.

182
00:16:49,775 --> 00:16:51,003
-Line drive.
-Line drive.

183
00:16:51,076 --> 00:16:52,338
Fly ball.

184
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:53,435
-Fly ball.
-Fly ball.

185
00:16:53,512 --> 00:16:54,638
Home run.

186
00:16:54,713 --> 00:16:55,737
-Home run.
-Home run.

187
00:16:55,814 --> 00:16:56,906
I got it. I got it.

188
00:16:56,982 --> 00:16:58,415
-I got it. I got it.
-I got it. I got it.

189
00:16:59,852 --> 00:17:02,878
Take me out to the ball game

190
00:17:02,955 --> 00:17:05,423
Take me out to the crowd

191
00:17:05,791 --> 00:17:08,851
Buy me some peanuts and Cracker Jack

192
00:17:08,927 --> 00:17:11,521
I don't care if I never get back

193
00:17:11,630 --> 00:17:14,758
Let me root, root, root for the home team

194
00:17:14,833 --> 00:17:16,960
If they don't win it's a shame

195
00:17:17,036 --> 00:17:18,697
For it's one, two...

196
00:17:39,191 --> 00:17:40,681
Have fun last night?

197
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:43,350
Feel better now?

198
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:45,118
Let's go.

199
00:17:46,565 --> 00:17:47,725
Okay, okay.

200
00:17:47,800 --> 00:17:49,495
Here we go, here we go!

201
00:17:50,402 --> 00:17:52,029
Okay, Sugar, let's do this!

202
00:18:09,988 --> 00:18:11,387
Strike one.

203
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:20,496
Strike two.

204
00:18:21,567 --> 00:18:23,467
Three. Strike three.

205
00:18:36,482 --> 00:18:37,949
Strike three.

206
00:18:49,428 --> 00:18:52,363
Hey, wipe that smile off your face.

207
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:58,035
Salvador, warm up.
You're pitching the next inning.

208
00:19:07,546 --> 00:19:08,979
Let's go.

209
00:19:13,218 --> 00:19:15,743
Just when I was
starting to like you.

210
00:19:16,021 --> 00:19:18,353
You go and do something stupid.

211
00:19:19,057 --> 00:19:21,389
What have you got to say
for yourselves?

212
00:19:21,460 --> 00:19:23,519
Alfonso was with us too.

213
00:19:23,595 --> 00:19:25,119
Don't give me excuses.

214
00:19:25,197 --> 00:19:27,461
Your behavior is unacceptable.

215
00:19:27,533 --> 00:19:30,525
You need to understand.
You've still got a long way to go.

216
00:19:30,602 --> 00:19:33,662
First, you've got to make it
to the minor leagues.

217
00:19:33,739 --> 00:19:36,640
Rookie ball.
Single-A, Double-A...

218
00:19:36,708 --> 00:19:38,175
Triple-A.

219
00:19:38,243 --> 00:19:43,203
All that before you
even set foot in the majors.

220
00:19:43,782 --> 00:19:47,218
So you had better watch what you do.

221
00:19:47,286 --> 00:19:50,847
Because nobody's going
to take this shit...

222
00:19:50,923 --> 00:19:52,891
from a pair of Dominican rookies...

223
00:19:52,958 --> 00:19:54,755
when you get to the U.S.

224
00:19:55,761 --> 00:19:57,729
You've been invited to spring training.

225
00:20:00,999 --> 00:20:02,261
Congratulations.

226
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,543
You've got a call.
He says it's important.

227
00:20:43,842 --> 00:20:46,811
This was your father's.
I want you to take it with you.

228
00:20:47,346 --> 00:20:50,008
God has given you
a marvelous gift.

229
00:20:50,215 --> 00:20:52,945
And God willing,
you'll do great things with it.

230
00:20:56,989 --> 00:21:00,789
Miguelito! Don't ever forget
your Uncle Angel.

231
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,358
Lupe! Your cousin Lupe!

232
00:21:02,427 --> 00:21:03,416
I'm Omayra.

233
00:21:03,528 --> 00:21:04,517
Your cousin. Lupe.

234
00:21:04,596 --> 00:21:05,858
Lola! Your Aunt Lola!

235
00:21:05,931 --> 00:21:07,865
Remember we went skinny-dipping
at the Malecon...

236
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:08,922
When?

237
00:21:09,001 --> 00:21:11,492
You were like eight
and terrified of goats.

238
00:21:11,570 --> 00:21:12,696
My nephew.

239
00:21:12,771 --> 00:21:13,760
Your neighbor Ana.

240
00:21:13,839 --> 00:21:16,967
You cried and cried...
You were such a baby, man.

241
00:21:17,042 --> 00:21:18,600
What's your name again?

242
00:21:18,677 --> 00:21:20,110
I'm Omayra. Your cousin.

243
00:21:20,178 --> 00:21:21,167
Your Uncle Jefe!

244
00:21:21,246 --> 00:21:22,235
Uncle Angel.

245
00:21:22,314 --> 00:21:23,542
I grew up around here.

246
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:26,413
Don't give me any shit. I taught you
everything you know, hear?

247
00:21:26,885 --> 00:21:28,512
Hey, Frank, what's up?

248
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:33,655
I'm proud of you, kid.
Your father would be, too.

249
00:21:35,661 --> 00:21:38,494
Thanks. I owe it all to you.

250
00:21:38,597 --> 00:21:39,586
Not all of it.

251
00:21:39,765 --> 00:21:41,392
Just forty percent.

252
00:21:42,567 --> 00:21:45,968
I spent the best years
of my life playing in the U.S.

253
00:21:46,505 --> 00:21:49,941
Remember...
Life gives you lots of opportunities.

254
00:21:50,008 --> 00:21:51,873
Baseball only gives you one.

255
00:21:51,943 --> 00:21:54,878
When it comes, take advantage of it
as much as you can. Enjoy it.

256
00:21:56,214 --> 00:21:57,681
How's the new curve?

257
00:21:57,849 --> 00:21:59,180
It's sweet.

258
00:21:59,251 --> 00:22:00,548
Here.

259
00:22:01,253 --> 00:22:02,550
What's this for?

260
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,145
For your autograph.

261
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,955
I'm kidding, you arrogant prick.

262
00:22:09,027 --> 00:22:11,257
That's so you'll write
to your family.

263
00:22:11,963 --> 00:22:14,090
And to me, too, if you feel like it.

264
00:22:45,163 --> 00:22:47,290
So where's that boyfriend of yours?

265
00:22:47,599 --> 00:22:48,759
Which one?

266
00:22:48,834 --> 00:22:51,098
That ugly kid you've got.

267
00:22:51,269 --> 00:22:52,429
Fernando!

268
00:22:52,904 --> 00:22:54,701
He's out there dancing with Sofia.

269
00:22:54,773 --> 00:22:56,240
With who?

270
00:22:56,308 --> 00:22:57,900
With Sofia.

271
00:22:58,844 --> 00:23:02,245
You know, Sis...
I'm very proud of you.

272
00:23:02,314 --> 00:23:04,407
I know you're going
to do great things, too.

273
00:23:04,683 --> 00:23:06,275
We all know it.

274
00:23:06,985 --> 00:23:08,577
I'm going to miss you.

275
00:23:09,020 --> 00:23:10,851
Come on. Let's go dance.

276
00:23:10,922 --> 00:23:13,720
No, you go. I'll come later.

277
00:23:13,792 --> 00:23:15,851
And tell Fernando
to watch it with my girl...

278
00:23:15,927 --> 00:23:17,827
unless he wants
problems with me, okay?

279
00:23:54,566 --> 00:23:57,467
Ladies and gentlemen, from the flight deck.

280
00:23:57,669 --> 00:24:00,968
Still apparently
about 110 miles from the Phoenix airport.

281
00:24:01,673 --> 00:24:04,335
Estimating an on-time arrival at the gate.

282
00:24:42,147 --> 00:24:43,341
Check this out.

283
00:24:44,082 --> 00:24:45,606
Did you look in the fridge?

284
00:24:49,421 --> 00:24:51,082
To the States.

285
00:24:51,857 --> 00:24:54,223
To the States. We've arrived!

286
00:25:02,367 --> 00:25:04,198
To the States!

287
00:25:09,107 --> 00:25:10,734
What's up, Jorge!

288
00:25:18,984 --> 00:25:23,546
Never, never, never
drink from the hotel minibar.

289
00:25:23,622 --> 00:25:25,249
That stuff is really expensive.

290
00:25:25,323 --> 00:25:29,316
You want beer? Buy it at the store.

291
00:25:29,594 --> 00:25:31,289
You want to see titties?

292
00:25:31,830 --> 00:25:33,889
There are magazines for that.

293
00:25:33,965 --> 00:25:35,728
Don't use the pay-per-view
in the hotel.

294
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,563
Okay, you boys ready?

295
00:25:38,236 --> 00:25:41,000
-French toast, please?
-Okay. Who's next?

296
00:25:43,108 --> 00:25:44,803
-French toast.
-French toast.

297
00:25:59,391 --> 00:26:00,790
All right, let's go.

298
00:26:00,859 --> 00:26:02,952
Go. Go, go, go.

299
00:26:03,028 --> 00:26:04,290
Brad Johnson.

300
00:26:04,896 --> 00:26:10,163
Just out of college.
They signed him for a million dollars.

301
00:26:11,303 --> 00:26:15,000
There's a lot of guys like that.
Don't let it intimidate you.

302
00:26:15,206 --> 00:26:20,200
Everyone knows
Dominicans rule the game.

303
00:26:20,345 --> 00:26:22,905
What's this about
Dominicans ruling the game?

304
00:26:22,981 --> 00:26:26,041
I think he was talking
about the Venezuelans.

305
00:26:26,151 --> 00:26:27,880
Are these your brothers?

306
00:26:27,953 --> 00:26:31,389
Are you telling me
all Dominicans look the same?

307
00:26:31,489 --> 00:26:32,786
Exactly.

308
00:26:32,857 --> 00:26:35,382
Miguel and Marcos.
Up from Boca Chica.

309
00:26:36,161 --> 00:26:38,186
Ed and Orlando.

310
00:26:38,363 --> 00:26:41,196
I left these fools behind
when I moved up to Double-A.

311
00:26:41,266 --> 00:26:43,666
-But you couldn't hang in Wichita.
-I hurt my knee, asshole.

312
00:26:44,202 --> 00:26:46,227
But I'm healthy now.
You'll see.

313
00:26:46,304 --> 00:26:49,296
Fifty bucks you're
back in lowa next month.

314
00:26:49,374 --> 00:26:52,104
Fifty bucks that next month...

315
00:26:52,177 --> 00:26:54,338
you're still an asshole.

316
00:26:57,849 --> 00:27:00,613
Now you just remember that
until you reach the top,

317
00:27:00,685 --> 00:27:03,813
there's always guys above you
hustling to keep you down here

318
00:27:03,888 --> 00:27:06,322
and guys below you pushing
to take your jobs.

319
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:12,122
Now we got 75 pitchers in this camp
for less than 50 positions come April 3rd.

320
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,664
You do the math.

321
00:27:13,732 --> 00:27:15,199
You're all gonna work hard.

322
00:27:41,926 --> 00:27:43,723
Bring over Leonard.

323
00:28:12,290 --> 00:28:14,258
Welcome to America, son.

324
00:28:24,436 --> 00:28:26,597
Today I pitched to Gus Leonard.

325
00:28:26,805 --> 00:28:28,067
You strike him out?

326
00:28:28,807 --> 00:28:29,967
Yes...

327
00:28:30,041 --> 00:28:31,372
Liar.

328
00:28:31,443 --> 00:28:33,673
-You don't believe me?
-No.

329
00:28:33,745 --> 00:28:37,272
OK, but...
I got one strike at least.

330
00:28:37,749 --> 00:28:40,217
So, do you like it there?

331
00:28:40,285 --> 00:28:41,650
It's different.

332
00:28:41,720 --> 00:28:44,518
The food here is really sweet.

333
00:28:44,589 --> 00:28:47,456
But I thought you liked
sweet things.

334
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:53,195
All the players are really good.

335
00:28:53,498 --> 00:28:54,897
But not like you.

336
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,093
No, of course not.

337
00:28:57,635 --> 00:28:59,330
But they're pretty good.

338
00:29:01,473 --> 00:29:02,906
I miss you.

339
00:29:03,608 --> 00:29:05,371
I miss you, too.

340
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:17,685
Time, Ump.

341
00:29:44,182 --> 00:29:45,376
Come on, let's see what you got.

342
00:29:45,450 --> 00:29:46,917
Come on.

343
00:29:47,886 --> 00:29:49,114
Let's go.

344
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:56,119
Strike.

345
00:30:04,369 --> 00:30:05,597
Strike.

346
00:30:07,639 --> 00:30:09,038
That's it right there!

347
00:30:11,176 --> 00:30:12,541
Let's go! One more!

348
00:30:19,584 --> 00:30:20,846
Yeah, man.

349
00:31:02,093 --> 00:31:03,458
Good catch.

350
00:31:03,795 --> 00:31:04,921
Thanks, man.

351
00:31:07,599 --> 00:31:08,861
I just got lucky.

352
00:31:25,183 --> 00:31:26,582
French toast, right?

353
00:31:27,252 --> 00:31:28,913
No. Egg.

354
00:31:28,987 --> 00:31:30,921
-Egg, please.
-Eggs?

355
00:31:30,989 --> 00:31:33,355
No problem. How'd you like 'em?

356
00:31:35,026 --> 00:31:36,084
Yes.

357
00:31:37,829 --> 00:31:39,421
Okay...

358
00:31:40,098 --> 00:31:42,658
Scrambled, over easy, sunny side up?

359
00:31:48,673 --> 00:31:50,334
French toast.

360
00:31:50,408 --> 00:31:51,568
No eggs?

361
00:31:52,977 --> 00:31:54,444
You sure?

362
00:31:54,512 --> 00:31:56,139
French toast, please.

363
00:31:57,181 --> 00:32:00,048
All right, honey. French toast it is.

364
00:32:12,063 --> 00:32:14,088
This is scrambled.

365
00:32:17,235 --> 00:32:18,862
Scrambled.

366
00:32:19,871 --> 00:32:21,168
Scrambled.

367
00:32:21,239 --> 00:32:22,934
This is over easy.

368
00:32:23,508 --> 00:32:25,032
Over easy.

369
00:32:26,344 --> 00:32:28,869
Okay, this one's a little trickier, okay?

370
00:32:28,947 --> 00:32:30,938
-Sunny...
-Sunny...

371
00:32:31,015 --> 00:32:32,380
-Side...
-Side...

372
00:32:32,450 --> 00:32:33,712
-Up.
-Up.

373
00:32:34,485 --> 00:32:37,147
Sunny side up. On the house.

374
00:32:38,690 --> 00:32:40,021
Thank you.

375
00:32:40,091 --> 00:32:41,251
You're welcome.

376
00:33:08,019 --> 00:33:09,850
They're sending Antonio back.

377
00:33:12,056 --> 00:33:13,250
And you guys?

378
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:14,756
We're staying here. Rookie ball.

379
00:33:15,860 --> 00:33:17,293
Go take a look at the list.

380
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:30,474
We're not together?

381
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,041
Straight to Single-A with Jorge.

382
00:33:33,177 --> 00:33:34,474
Congratulations.

383
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:43,251
Where's l-A?

384
00:34:05,676 --> 00:34:08,474
A lot of the ball players
have stayed at our house.

385
00:34:08,546 --> 00:34:12,175
We've had Dominicans
and Venezuelan boys.

386
00:34:12,750 --> 00:34:15,514
A Colombian and even one from Panama.

387
00:34:15,586 --> 00:34:19,352
Last year we had a boy, Junior Sanchez.
Nice boy.

388
00:34:19,957 --> 00:34:23,222
Decent glove,
but he couldn't bunt to save his life.

389
00:34:23,294 --> 00:34:26,229
Two out of twelve in sacrifice situations.

390
00:34:26,297 --> 00:34:28,993
Yeah. He cost us at least two victories.

391
00:34:29,067 --> 00:34:32,628
Oh, Earl, that's generous. I'd say four or five.

392
00:34:36,307 --> 00:34:40,710
Okay, Miguel. You put your things down
and I'll show you around.

393
00:34:43,748 --> 00:34:45,511
This is the kitchen.

394
00:34:45,983 --> 00:34:48,713
You can help yourself to anything
you'd like.

395
00:34:48,786 --> 00:34:50,720
If there are special foods you'd like to eat,

396
00:34:50,788 --> 00:34:54,155
just write them down
on the grocery list right here.

397
00:34:56,294 --> 00:34:59,354
Oh, and this drawer here is a little funny.

398
00:34:59,430 --> 00:35:01,728
You have to be careful or it'll...

399
00:35:03,568 --> 00:35:06,264
This is the washer and the dryer.

400
00:35:06,337 --> 00:35:07,998
For your clothes.

401
00:35:08,272 --> 00:35:10,103
You put the soap in here.

402
00:35:10,475 --> 00:35:11,737
"Soup."

403
00:35:11,809 --> 00:35:14,403
And this one is just hot air.

404
00:35:16,848 --> 00:35:18,440
The bathroom.

405
00:35:22,653 --> 00:35:26,089
This is your new cuarto. Bedroom.

406
00:35:26,491 --> 00:35:29,824
You do with it as you please.
Except no girls.

407
00:35:30,561 --> 00:35:33,394
Chicas. No chicas.

408
00:35:34,532 --> 00:35:37,763
No drinking. No cervezas in the casa.

409
00:35:38,903 --> 00:35:42,031
-No chicas in the bedroom.
-I already told him that one.

410
00:35:42,106 --> 00:35:44,199
Okay. What about a quiet time?

411
00:35:44,275 --> 00:35:45,401
Oh, right.

412
00:35:45,877 --> 00:35:50,143
There's no real curfew,
but you must be quiet after 10:00.

413
00:35:50,214 --> 00:35:53,615
Diez. After diez.

414
00:35:56,187 --> 00:35:57,347
-10:00.
-Yeah.

415
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,513
Okay.

416
00:36:00,191 --> 00:36:01,783
That's all we ask.

417
00:36:01,859 --> 00:36:05,260
It's our job to keep you healthy
and focused on baseball.

418
00:36:05,329 --> 00:36:07,593
And we take pride in that.

419
00:36:11,502 --> 00:36:15,233
Everyone is so proud, Miguelito.
It's all we talk about.

420
00:36:15,606 --> 00:36:16,766
Did you get the money?

421
00:36:16,974 --> 00:36:17,963
Of course.

422
00:36:18,376 --> 00:36:21,607
And Victor, can he start construction
of the house again?

423
00:36:21,946 --> 00:36:23,811
I'll be sending money
every two weeks now.

424
00:36:24,315 --> 00:36:27,546
We just paid him.
He's coming next week.

425
00:36:27,818 --> 00:36:29,945
Did you get something
for yourself like I said?

426
00:36:30,254 --> 00:36:31,949
Me? What do I need?

427
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,884
-Don't say that, Mom...
-Why?

428
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:36,081
You didn't get anything?

429
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:39,557
Well, maybe a pair of shoes,
but I am not telling.

430
00:36:39,964 --> 00:36:41,864
Good for you, Mom.

431
00:36:42,667 --> 00:36:45,192
Miguel. Time for dinner.

432
00:36:46,337 --> 00:36:49,272
I have to go, Mom.
The lady's calling me.

433
00:36:49,340 --> 00:36:50,466
Smells like dinner.

434
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:52,702
Don't forget
who your real mother is.

435
00:36:52,910 --> 00:36:55,378
Are you going to prefer
her cooking to mine now?

436
00:36:55,947 --> 00:36:57,642
Impossible, Mom.

437
00:36:58,149 --> 00:37:01,209
We love you. We miss you.
Strike one out for me, okay?

438
00:37:01,452 --> 00:37:03,147
I love you. Bye.

439
00:37:04,789 --> 00:37:05,881
Dear God.

440
00:37:05,957 --> 00:37:08,653
Thank you for this meal we're about to eat

441
00:37:08,726 --> 00:37:11,627
and for blessing us with our new guest.

442
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:14,164
Thank you for guiding him safely
on his journey

443
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:17,531
from the Dominican Republic to Bridgetown.

444
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:22,130
And finally, Lord, please look kindly
on our Swing this season.

445
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:24,868
May all of the players stay healthy and...

446
00:37:25,776 --> 00:37:27,266
Well, why not?

447
00:37:27,345 --> 00:37:30,542
If there's anything you can do to help us
win another championship,

448
00:37:30,615 --> 00:37:32,378
we'll take that, too.

449
00:37:32,683 --> 00:37:34,810
-Amen.
-Amen.

450
00:37:38,189 --> 00:37:41,283
So, Miguel, do you eat meatloaf back home?

451
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,328
I already told you, Michael,
he doesn't speak any English.

452
00:37:44,395 --> 00:37:47,523
I know, but I'm just curious to know
what he thinks of the meatloaf.

453
00:37:47,598 --> 00:37:49,930
Well, what do you care, you didn't cook it.

454
00:37:50,001 --> 00:37:52,731
I doubt they have meatloaf in
the Dominican Republic, dear.

455
00:37:52,803 --> 00:37:56,796
Well, I'll bet they have something similar.
They probably just have another name for it.

456
00:38:12,590 --> 00:38:14,558
I like. Thank you.

457
00:38:15,626 --> 00:38:17,116
Very good, Miguel.

458
00:38:17,628 --> 00:38:20,529
De nada to you, mi amigo. De nada to you.

459
00:38:43,254 --> 00:38:44,687
C'mon, let's find you a suit.

460
00:38:44,855 --> 00:38:47,016
I can't afford a suit.

461
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:50,388
I didn't say buy a suit.
I said find a suit.

462
00:38:50,695 --> 00:38:53,926
So when you make it to the big leagues,
you'll know what looks good.

463
00:38:55,566 --> 00:38:56,726
Like it?

464
00:38:57,134 --> 00:39:01,264
Hot damn! That's what's up, bro!

465
00:39:01,405 --> 00:39:02,429
It's cool?

466
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:05,301
Man, you look like an all-star.

467
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:11,907
Starting pitcher for American League

468
00:39:11,982 --> 00:39:18,820
from Kansas City, Miguel Sugar Santos.

469
00:39:23,127 --> 00:39:24,856
What about you?
You try one.

470
00:39:24,995 --> 00:39:28,487
Me? Nah...
I'm all washed up.

471
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,930
C'mon, man. Don't say that.

472
00:39:34,872 --> 00:39:35,998
Hey.

473
00:39:38,075 --> 00:39:39,269
Very nice.

474
00:39:39,510 --> 00:39:42,570
Dude, you have no idea.
Just wait till we go to Big Muddy's.

475
00:39:42,747 --> 00:39:43,736
Big Muddy's?

476
00:39:47,718 --> 00:39:49,845
You have to be 21 to drink there.

477
00:39:50,254 --> 00:39:52,722
This is my old license.
They won't know the difference.

478
00:39:56,494 --> 00:39:58,086
Are you crazy?

479
00:39:58,629 --> 00:40:01,063
Who's going to believe
I'm this ugly fool?

480
00:40:01,298 --> 00:40:04,290
You wish you were this good-looking.

481
00:40:04,735 --> 00:40:07,932
Believe me.
They won't know the difference.

482
00:40:40,604 --> 00:40:43,971
Hey, Santos. You're right over there.

483
00:40:59,256 --> 00:41:00,689
What up, flaco?

484
00:41:00,758 --> 00:41:04,353
Dude, I was totally psyched
when I saw your name on the squad.

485
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:05,861
Yeah, okay.

486
00:41:05,930 --> 00:41:07,420
Hey, good times.

487
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,599
Good evening, ladies and gentlemen,
boys and girls.

488
00:41:46,670 --> 00:41:49,264
You're listening to "Swing Time" on WKBI.

489
00:41:49,340 --> 00:41:52,400
Welcome to another exciting season
of Swing baseball.

490
00:41:52,476 --> 00:41:55,445
As always, we've got some new faces
that we'll get to see tonight,

491
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:58,846
including Brad Johnson, the highly touted
second baseman out of Stanford.

492
00:41:58,916 --> 00:42:00,611
He'll make his pro debut.

493
00:42:00,951 --> 00:42:02,543
It's a great night for Swing baseball

494
00:42:02,620 --> 00:42:05,350
and a great night for a bite and a brew
after the game at Harlow's,

495
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,754
your local pub and proud sponsor.

496
00:42:07,825 --> 00:42:12,319
Oh, say, can you see

497
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:16,924
By the dawn's early light

498
00:42:17,001 --> 00:42:21,665
What so proudly we hailed...

499
00:42:22,339 --> 00:42:26,901
Leading off for Wisconsin,
the second baseman, Tim Lewis.

500
00:42:55,439 --> 00:42:57,339
Relax, take it easy!

501
00:43:11,989 --> 00:43:13,354
Come on.

502
00:43:20,230 --> 00:43:21,925
That's outside for ball four.

503
00:43:21,999 --> 00:43:25,992
Santos is apparently feeling some butterflies
for his first professional outing.

504
00:43:26,070 --> 00:43:27,970
Hailing all the way from
the Dominican Republic,

505
00:43:28,038 --> 00:43:31,337
this young man wowed the organization
with his power in spring training.

506
00:43:31,408 --> 00:43:34,241
But tonight, he's off to a rocky start.

507
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,801
Relax, Sugar.

508
00:43:36,847 --> 00:43:39,645
It's the same game
we played back home.

509
00:43:40,417 --> 00:43:44,751
That's all it is. So relax.
Let's have some fun, okay?

510
00:43:45,489 --> 00:43:46,513
See? Just like home.

511
00:43:46,590 --> 00:43:50,788
Now batting, right fielder, Luis Encarnacion.

512
00:44:08,479 --> 00:44:09,673
Strike.

513
00:45:10,441 --> 00:45:12,409
Line drive, hit in the air to left center field.

514
00:45:12,476 --> 00:45:16,139
That's gonna get down into the gap
and go for a double.

515
00:45:16,213 --> 00:45:19,842
Santos has been nearly unhittable
through the first six innings tonight.

516
00:45:19,917 --> 00:45:22,385
That's just the second hit he's given up.

517
00:45:33,597 --> 00:45:34,825
Ground ball towards third.

518
00:45:34,898 --> 00:45:37,093
This is gonna eat up Ramirez
and go out into left.

519
00:45:37,167 --> 00:45:38,634
You suck, Ramirez.

520
00:45:39,236 --> 00:45:43,639
One man's gonna score
and Santos has given up his first run.

521
00:45:45,142 --> 00:45:46,268
Time.

522
00:45:47,544 --> 00:45:51,537
Fans, join us for our next home game,
next Friday night...

523
00:45:51,615 --> 00:45:54,015
Nice game, son. Enjoy this.

524
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,512
Good game, Sugar.

525
00:45:56,120 --> 00:45:59,317
But that wasn't my fault.
I can go longer.

526
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:03,483
Take it easy. It's your first game.

527
00:46:04,294 --> 00:46:07,024
You hear that, son? That's for you.

528
00:46:54,211 --> 00:46:56,441
You think they know how to salsa?

529
00:46:56,580 --> 00:46:57,842
Go for it.

530
00:46:58,982 --> 00:47:00,540
But remember...

531
00:47:00,884 --> 00:47:03,853
just because they dance with you
doesn't mean they want anything else.

532
00:47:04,388 --> 00:47:06,481
Not from you, anyway.

533
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:08,181
What's up?!

534
00:47:09,827 --> 00:47:11,089
Hey, Slim!

535
00:47:11,295 --> 00:47:14,958
What's up, fellows?
Hey, good game, good game.

536
00:47:15,599 --> 00:47:18,124
Flaco, man, what's up with this flaco, huh?

537
00:47:18,202 --> 00:47:20,466
You all call this flaco?

538
00:47:21,038 --> 00:47:23,802
You thought you could lead us...

539
00:47:25,008 --> 00:47:27,306
C'mon, let's go for it.

540
00:47:28,645 --> 00:47:30,579
Let's do it.

541
00:48:52,529 --> 00:48:58,331
Dude, give me my keys.
You are not driving my car.

542
00:49:01,171 --> 00:49:01,939
Leaning, leaning

543
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,238
Leaning, leaning

544
00:49:05,309 --> 00:49:09,541
Safe and secure from all alarms

545
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:13,913
Leaning, leaning

546
00:49:13,984 --> 00:49:18,546
Leaning on the everlasting arms

547
00:49:18,622 --> 00:49:23,286
What have I to dread, what have I to fear

548
00:49:23,360 --> 00:49:27,319
Leaning on the everlasting arms

549
00:49:30,500 --> 00:49:32,559
How'd you like the service?

550
00:49:33,303 --> 00:49:35,703
Our church?
I hope it wasn't too boring for you.

551
00:49:35,772 --> 00:49:38,764
Did you go to church
in the Dominican Republic?

552
00:49:40,177 --> 00:49:41,940
I'm sorry. I don't think...

553
00:49:42,012 --> 00:49:43,502
Well, that's okay.

554
00:49:43,580 --> 00:49:47,346
You understand more than
a lot of the folks around here, I bet.

555
00:49:48,185 --> 00:49:50,085
Hey, good luck tonight.

556
00:49:54,725 --> 00:49:58,491
Who is your...favorite player?

557
00:49:58,662 --> 00:50:02,462
Robinson Cano from the Yankees. And you?

558
00:50:02,532 --> 00:50:04,932
-Roberto Clemente.
-Who is that?

559
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,060
What?

560
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:09,032
Man, come on,
you don't know about Clemente?

561
00:50:09,106 --> 00:50:11,597
-Dominican?
-No, he's Puerto Rican.

562
00:50:12,409 --> 00:50:13,899
Man, this is tragic.

563
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,813
Do you know who Babe Ruth is?

564
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,908
Baby Ruth. The chocolate.

565
00:50:25,188 --> 00:50:27,383
Hey, you like TV on the Radio?

566
00:50:27,457 --> 00:50:28,788
TV what?

567
00:50:29,126 --> 00:50:30,684
Here. Check it out.

568
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,484
"Santos stings Owls with 8 Ks."

569
00:51:35,025 --> 00:51:37,823
What kind of shoddy journalism is that?
They don't even mention me.

570
00:51:59,116 --> 00:52:02,142
At what point in the game did you know
you had your best stuff tonight?

571
00:52:02,219 --> 00:52:04,983
When did you realize you were
going to be a good pitcher?

572
00:52:05,956 --> 00:52:09,187
I knew since I was very young
I would be a good pitcher.

573
00:52:09,292 --> 00:52:11,556
Ten, eleven years old, around then.

574
00:52:11,761 --> 00:52:16,061
Thanks to God, I've had
the opportunity to develop my talents.

575
00:52:18,201 --> 00:52:22,103
He knew very early that he was going
to pitch good. 11 years.

576
00:52:44,161 --> 00:52:48,222
That forever, as we pray

577
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:52,231
proper, that you will never
forsake us or never leave us.

578
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:57,467
We ask this in Jesus' name, amen.

579
00:52:57,674 --> 00:53:00,370
I have in my hands a rulebook.

580
00:53:03,313 --> 00:53:05,543
Hey, Miguel. Come on inside.

581
00:53:05,615 --> 00:53:07,549
My first strikeout.

582
00:53:08,185 --> 00:53:10,619
Oh, Miguel, you're so sweet.

583
00:53:11,788 --> 00:53:14,484
Congratulations.
I heard you pitched awesome tonight.

584
00:53:17,494 --> 00:53:20,258
Hey, everyone. This is Miguel.

585
00:53:20,330 --> 00:53:24,323
He's from the Dominican Republic
and now he pitches for the Swing.

586
00:53:24,568 --> 00:53:25,899
Hi, Miguel.

587
00:53:29,806 --> 00:53:31,273
What's up, man?

588
00:53:32,142 --> 00:53:34,770
-You want to play?
-No, no. Thank you.

589
00:53:34,844 --> 00:53:37,472
No, come on. It's like soccer.
Do you play soccer?

590
00:53:37,547 --> 00:53:39,242
No. Baseball.

591
00:53:39,316 --> 00:53:42,877
Well, this is foosball. Foosball.

592
00:53:42,953 --> 00:53:45,217
-Foosball.
-Yeah, you got it.

593
00:53:49,859 --> 00:53:52,259
You know, I used to be a pitcher.
In the Little Leagues.

594
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:53,796
I wasn't very good, though.

595
00:53:54,631 --> 00:53:57,862
I heard that the beaches in the
Dominican Republic are really beautiful.

596
00:54:04,574 --> 00:54:08,840
All right, guys. Let's get started.
Everybody grab a seat.

597
00:54:15,218 --> 00:54:17,516
All right, well,
I'm glad you guys could all come.

598
00:54:17,587 --> 00:54:19,748
Last year we didn't have
half as many people in our group.

599
00:54:19,823 --> 00:54:22,553
So I think this just goes to show
the great job

600
00:54:22,626 --> 00:54:25,220
that we've been doing
in spreading the word.

601
00:54:26,229 --> 00:54:28,823
Yeah, this year I want us to work harder.

602
00:54:28,898 --> 00:54:31,731
I know a lot of you guys
are studying for the SATs

603
00:54:31,801 --> 00:54:35,567
or preparing for college applications.
All of that's very important.

604
00:54:35,639 --> 00:54:41,009
But, we need to remember that our spiritual
accomplishments are more important.

605
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:44,279
What we do in school or for a job,

606
00:54:44,347 --> 00:54:46,508
that's just a small part of who we are.

607
00:54:46,583 --> 00:54:48,380
We're only here by the grace of God,

608
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,477
so let's get out there and share that grace.

609
00:54:53,089 --> 00:54:54,750
No, it's not good.

610
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:58,557
Because I haven't been playing well.

611
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:05,601
Well, I'm working hard, but...

612
00:55:06,569 --> 00:55:08,730
I don't know. They might.

613
00:55:11,608 --> 00:55:14,441
Listen, let's talk about this later.

614
00:55:16,112 --> 00:55:19,411
Yeah, so... Tell me about...
