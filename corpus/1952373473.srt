351
00:30:35,955 --> 00:30:38,852

361
00:33:32,884 --> 00:33:36,709
Mine dad told me a storie about you.

362
00:33:37,316 --> 00:33:39,959
Your dad is Syracuse?

363
00:33:39,960 --> 00:33:42,041
Yeah, The fisherman.

364
00:33:42,042 --> 00:33:46,033
So, Do you have magic powers?

365
00:33:46,034 --> 00:33:48,636
Do you?
- You know, I don`t.

366
00:33:48,637 --> 00:33:52,001
Oke.You don`t.

367
00:33:52,014 --> 00:33:55,425
Can you make me better?

368
00:33:55,999 --> 00:33:58,028
Better ?

371
00:34:08,313 --> 00:34:10,908
Annie.

00:34:11,565 --> 00:34:14,220
I`m Ondine.

373
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:16,864
Ondine.

374
00:34:18,266 --> 00:34:21,583
I`m examining it for webs.

375
00:34:21,584 --> 00:34:24,252
Well, Do I, Disappoint you?

376
00:34:24,253 --> 00:34:29,900
Ondine it`s French isn`t it?
What is a French Selkie doing here?

377
00:34:29,901 --> 00:34:34,821
Who said that I, Was French?
- You got lost, Did you?

378
00:34:35,274 --> 00:34:39,251
Yes, I, Suppose, I did get lost.

379
00:34:39,252 --> 00:34:41,921
Your cold?
- Suddenly.

380
00:34:41,922 --> 00:34:47,067
Cause you are on land now.
- Your natural habbit has it in the water, You see.

381
00:34:47,068 --> 00:34:49,057
You seemed to know a lot about me.

382
00:34:49,058 --> 00:34:51,833
Yes, I have been reading...

383
00:34:51,834 --> 00:34:54,329
Researching...

384
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,251
Want to come inside?

385
00:34:56,252 --> 00:34:59,616
If, I cross the treshold,
- You might put on hex on me.

386
00:34:59,617 --> 00:35:04,454
What is a "Hex" ?
- It`s bad news a hex.

387
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:15,676
Maybe under water feels better.
- Better then what?

388
00:35:15,677 --> 00:35:21,491
Some days I`m sick all the time.
- Does it feel better under water?

389
00:35:21,697 --> 00:35:23,671
I`m not sure, I know what you mean.

390
00:35:23,672 --> 00:35:28,317
Oh, Come on, Let`s not try and fool each other.
- We both know the truth.

391
00:35:28,318 --> 00:35:33,651
And if we are not safe for it,
- There is no point of being friends.

392
00:35:33,652 --> 00:35:35,680
So, We have to be friends then ?

393
00:35:35,681 --> 00:35:39,044
We could be,
If we play fair to each other.

394
00:35:39,045 --> 00:35:42,255
I need you to be specific.

395
00:35:42,302 --> 00:35:46,548
Feel any better in that home of yours under the waves?

396
00:35:47,689 --> 00:35:51,051
But, Definitely feels different.

397
00:35:51,052 --> 00:35:56,372
And I, Know you don`t talk down there,
- You sing.

398
00:35:56,373 --> 00:36:00,658
Yes, Singing travels by under water.

399
00:36:00,659 --> 00:36:03,018
What about the cold?

400
00:36:03,019 --> 00:36:04,932
You get used to it.

401
00:36:04,933 --> 00:36:09,715
Oh, Of course you have a sealcoat don`t you ?

402
00:36:11,037 --> 00:36:12,411
Mine sealcoat?

403
00:36:12,412 --> 00:36:18,560
Look, There is no point of being around the bush.
- I, Do know these things, I , Have been studying them.

404
00:36:21,029 --> 00:36:25,033
So, Tell me about mine sealcoat.

405
00:36:25,034 --> 00:36:27,042
You lose it when you get out of the water.

406
00:36:27,043 --> 00:36:29,679
And you can`t go back until you find it again.

407
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:32,428
And if you do find it, And bury it on land.

408
00:36:32,429 --> 00:36:36,427
You can stay for seven years,
- And you cry seven tears.

409
00:36:36,428 --> 00:36:38,403
But when the crying is done.

410
00:36:38,404 --> 00:36:43,783
Youre kind of folk can not find the excepted happienes.
- With the..

411
00:36:43,784 --> 00:36:47,040
What is it called?
- Are you lost for words?

412
00:36:47,041 --> 00:36:49,076
A landsman, That`s what.

413
00:36:49,077 --> 00:36:54,402
Selkie women often find unexpected happienes with a landsman.

414
00:36:54,403 --> 00:36:57,600
And that`s all, I know.

415
00:36:58,448 --> 00:37:03,101
This is my granny`s place.
He misses her.

416
00:37:09,389 --> 00:37:11,083
Where do you live?

417

418
00:37:14,448 --> 00:37:17,958
She, Will be wondering where I`am.

419
00:37:20,422 --> 00:37:23,618
See you again.

420
00:37:24,427 --> 00:37:28,504
Your cheek is wet?
- Is that one of the seven tears.

421
00:37:28,505 --> 00:37:32,595
Maybe.
- You have only six left.

422
00:37:37,096 --> 00:37:39,163

Stunts like this.

00:38:11,170 --> 00:38:15,174
It`s not a recreation.
- So it is only for spasms?

432
00:38:15,175 --> 00:38:17,911
You don`t say spasms.
You say, Specially`s, Do it Johny?

433
00:38:17,912 --> 00:38:19,232

What`s there something up?
- Why did you think?

442
00:38:57,012 --> 00:39:00,691
Was it battery trouble?
- It got wet.

447
00:39:15,094 --> 00:39:19,706
We invented Selkies.

Can, I help?

462
00:41:29,912 --> 00:41:33,337

Weird?

472
00:43:19,399 --> 00:43:23,123
You don`t get Salmon`s from shaling.
- Shaling.

473
00:43:24,018 --> 00:43:26,066
Only with a gear net.

474
00:43:26,067 --> 00:43:29,430
Curiouser and curiouser.
- Where did you hear that?

475

Alice said that.
- To the White rabbit.

And you expect us to believe that?
- No, But it is the truth.

483
00:44:32,141 --> 00:44:35,766
Show us your gear nets. Hold on.

00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:44,789
That`s not wet.
- I know.

485
00:44:44,790 --> 00:44:49,335
So, how did you dry them?
- I didn`t. I told you, I didn`t use them.

486
00:44:55,443 --> 00:44:58,119
There is a girl here, Circus.
- Where?

487
00:44:58,120 --> 00:45:01,250
In your net.

488
00:45:01,611 --> 00:45:05,800
Is that illegal?
- No, But...It`s unusual.

489
00:45:06,531 --> 00:45:09,333
And you can see her?
- She`s right here in front of me.

490
00:45:09,334 --> 00:45:12,363
Ask her how, I caught the Salmon.

491
00:45:12,364 --> 00:45:15,045
How did he catch them up?

492
00:45:15,046 --> 00:45:17,008
Trouling.

493
00:45:17,009 --> 00:45:19,718
And you want us to believe in fairytales?

494
00:45:19,719 --> 00:45:22,248
Yes.

495
00:45:23,003 --> 00:45:25,097
What did she say?

496
00:45:25,098 --> 00:45:29,244
She said: Yes. Realy.
- You got to believe her.

497
00:45:29,277 --> 00:45:32,928

Is that all right?
- No.

500
00:46:01,965 --> 00:46:05,325
That it is a relief in a way, Things are not in my mind.

501
00:46:05,326 --> 00:46:08,973
These will talk.
- Of course they will.

502
00:46:08,974 --> 00:46:12,296
What wil they say?

503
00:46:12,297 --> 00:46:14,244
Take your pick.

00:46:14,245 --> 00:46:19,032
Circus. Clowns. Salmon. A girl.

505
00:46:19,565 --> 00:46:23,056
I`m going to the harbor.
- Do you want me to drop you off.

00:47:42,540 --> 00:47:46,536
The underwear could be better.
- Didn`t fit?

523
00:47:46,537 --> 00:47:49,887
Tighten on the edges.

524
00:47:49,888 --> 00:47:53,086
You have edges?

525
00:47:56,557 --> 00:47:59,252
I, Knew it wasn`t a storie.
- What wasn`t a storie?

526
00:47:59,253 --> 00:48:02,931
Youre just a shit storie teller any way.
I, Knew it had to be true.

527
00:48:02,932 --> 00:48:06,566
Ondine, This is my daughter, Annie.

528
00:48:06,567 --> 00:48:09,467

00:48:11,935 --> 00:48:15,461
Buying clothes.
- Oke.

531
00:48:18,644 --> 00:48:23,289
This town is what you call.
- Southorely challenged.

532
00:48:23,290 --> 00:48:25,938
What does that mean?

533
00:48:25,939 --> 00:48:29,418
A supermodel`s nightmare.

534
00:48:36,777 --> 00:48:39,992
Does Selkies do lingerie?

535
00:48:40,097 --> 00:48:41,658
Why not?

536
00:48:41,659 --> 00:48:45,650
They wear seaweed knickers,
- And a skelpy bra.

537
00:48:45,651 --> 00:48:49,347
But that`s underwater,
- Won`t do here.

538
00:48:50,984 --> 00:48:56,151
I suggest you don`t buy them all dad,
- Just a selection.

539
00:48:59,895 --> 00:49:01,905
That`s where I, Found her...

540
00:49:01,906 --> 00:49:04,126
...Roan Carraig.

541
00:49:04,127 --> 00:49:07,860
You know what it means?
- Searock.

542
00:49:07,861 --> 00:49:11,901
It`s a kind a sanctuary,
- For her kind.

543
00:49:11,902 --> 00:49:14,598
Her kind?
- Yeah.

544
00:49:14,599 --> 00:49:18,203
The well dressed kind.

545
00:49:20,719 --> 00:49:24,077
What do you think?

546
00:49:24,711 --> 00:49:29,003
Or should we say what do they think?

547
00:49:56,737 --> 00:50:00,068
You have cleaned the place.

548
00:50:00,762 --> 00:50:04,168
Like Snowwhite.

549
00:50:05,420 --> 00:50:06,933
Is that all right?

550
00:50:06,934 --> 00:50:12,108
I`m not a dwarf you know,
- I`m little, But not a dwarf.

551
00:50:13,204 --> 00:50:15,859
Who is Snowwhite?
- Does it matter ?

552
00:50:15,860 --> 00:50:19,145
She didn`t swim.

553
00:50:21,193 --> 00:50:23,168
Can you swim, Annie?

554
00:50:23,169 --> 00:50:27,455
No, There is no pool in the town.
- I never had lessons.

555
00:50:27,868 --> 00:50:31,474
I think it could relax you a lot.

556
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:33,928
Unless you a have fear of water.

557
00:50:33,929 --> 00:50:39,202
I wouldn`t have a fear of water,
- With a water creature a round me.

558
00:50:43,200 --> 00:50:46,465
Oke then, Come on.

559
00:50:48,433 --> 00:50:51,784
What will a wear?

560
00:50:51,831 --> 00:50:54,975
Underwear.

561
00:51:02,535 --> 00:51:05,569
She`s gone already.

562
00:51:05,967 --> 00:51:09,201
Where?
- The caravan on the Poulin.

563
00:51:09,202 --> 00:51:13,558
Is that where she sleeps?
- Your waterbaby.

564
00:51:23,176 --> 00:51:26,486
I tought, I might take her out for the day.

565
00:51:26,487 --> 00:51:30,504
The regatta starts at three.
- Oh, The three of ya.

566
00:51:30,505 --> 00:51:33,862
Diving for pearls?

567
00:51:35,171 --> 00:51:37,940
Something like that.

568
00:51:39,256 --> 00:51:42,833
What kind a stories are you spinning?

569
00:51:46,197 --> 00:51:48,329

You see?

572
00:51:58,619 --> 00:52:00,965
You see? You are a sea-creature.

573
00:52:00,966 --> 00:52:04,267
You think?
- I know.

574
00:52:04,268 --> 00:52:07,270
Relax...

575
00:52:11,168 --> 00:52:14,846
Okee, Let`s go on the raft?

576
00:52:38,508 --> 00:52:39,868
What`s That?

577
00:52:39,869 --> 00:52:43,426
Just something, I found.
- You found your sealcoat.

578
00:52:43,427 --> 00:52:46,616
Maybe.
- Are you goinig to bury it?

579
00:52:46,617 --> 00:52:47,978
Would you like me to bury it?

580
00:52:47,979 --> 00:52:51,288
Yes, Because that means you wil be here for seven years.

581

Watch this.

586
00:53:25,391 --> 00:53:28,534
Seventeen steps.

587
00:53:29,390 --> 00:53:33,736
And, It is our secret,
- We tell nobody.

588
00:53:35,984 --> 00:53:40,002
You know dad, If she bury`s her sealcoat.

Unles her Selkie husband claimes her back.

Nice fries.
- Here..

594
00:54:28,528 --> 00:54:32,406
And the last thing is that she can make a wish come true.

595
00:54:32,407 --> 00:54:33,713
Please, Annie.

596
00:54:33,714 --> 00:54:38,728

The brakes swept.

What happend?
- She fell in the water. Chassing that rock.

611
00:56:33,845 --> 00:56:36,688
The brakes went mad.
- By the pier she saved me.

612
00:56:36,689 --> 00:56:40,600
Your waterbaby? Clown.

613
00:56:40,601 --> 00:56:44,332
Come on, Will get you upstairs and you go to the bad quik.

614
00:56:49,986 --> 00:56:52,661
The brakes they didn`t go did it?

615
00:56:52,662 --> 00:56:56,240
No, She did it herself.

616
00:56:56,313 --> 00:57:00,317
Why? Did she do it herself?
- To test me maybe.

617
00:57:00,318 --> 00:57:03,935
See how much I do for her.

618
00:57:07,675 --> 00:57:11,524
Strange, Feels like home.

619
00:57:12,647 --> 00:57:15,335
Who is this woman, Annie?

620
00:57:15,336 --> 00:57:19,044
She`s from the Orkney Islands.
- She swam around the coast to here.

621
00:57:19,045 --> 00:57:20,121
What if she was?

622
00:57:20,122 --> 00:57:23,785
I might be imaging.... scratch over there.

623
00:57:23,786 --> 00:57:25,982
A little bit cold around the thigh region.

624
00:57:25,983 --> 00:57:27,784
Stop him ma,
- Close the door.

625
00:57:27,785 --> 00:57:30,474
Your Clown of a fisherman,
- He wouldn`t notice though, Now would he.

626
00:57:30,475 --> 00:57:33,784
Close the door ma.

627
00:57:33,785 --> 00:57:37,161
Did he claimed her to the fishery`s board?

628
00:57:37,162 --> 00:57:40,472
How much would you do for her?

629
00:57:40,473 --> 00:57:42,915
You are testing me to?

630
00:57:42,916 --> 00:57:46,060
I`m sorry..

631
00:57:48,050 --> 00:57:51,352
So, Why do they call you Circus the Clown?

632
00:57:51,353 --> 00:57:54,096
Because I was one for years..

633
00:57:54,097 --> 00:57:56,705
I drink.

634
00:57:56,706 --> 00:57:59,904
What made you stop?

635
00:58:00,044 --> 00:58:01,290
Annie.

636
00:58:01,291 --> 00:58:04,387
I Came back from a week on the trollers.And..

637
00:58:04,388 --> 00:58:08,701
Found her without conscious, Her mother out in the pis.

638
00:58:08,702 --> 00:58:11,564
I tought one of us better be sober.

639
00:58:11,565 --> 00:58:14,774
And then she kicked me out.

640
00:58:14,775 --> 00:58:19,321
You could take Annie with you ?
- Ah.. This is Ireland.

641
00:58:19,381 --> 00:58:22,077
Men like me don`t get custody.

642
00:58:22,078 --> 00:58:24,720
Some one was looking for her. Who ?
- A man.

643
00:58:24,721 --> 00:58:26,249
A dark haired man?
- Yeah...

644
00:58:26,250 --> 00:58:28,744
You didn`t tell them ?
- What is her name ? - Ondine.

645
00:58:28,745 --> 00:58:31,392
That is not what he called her.

646
00:58:32,730 --> 00:58:35,948
Men like you?
- Fisherman.

647
00:58:46,113 --> 00:58:49,197
Are you dry ?

648
00:59:00,470 --> 00:59:03,354
Didn`t Annie tell you?

649
00:59:03,355 --> 00:59:06,794
When a Selk make love to a fisherman..

650
00:59:06,795 --> 00:59:09,324
She weeps...

651
00:59:09,690 --> 00:59:12,149
Salt tears.

652
00:59:30,260 --> 00:59:34,467
You said you died in the water.

653
00:59:35,233 --> 00:59:37,923
How many lives do you have?

654
00:59:37,924 --> 00:59:40,420
For you?

655
00:59:40,473 --> 00:59:43,183

Two years, Seven months and..

01:00:10,410 --> 01:00:13,573
You are doing very well, Syracuse.
- It`s about the girl father.

660
01:00:13,574 --> 01:00:18,360
Oh, Yes. The one you have met out fishing.

661
01:00:19,278 --> 01:00:23,498
I drew her up in the net, Father.
- She look prettty real to me.Circus.

662
01:00:23,499 --> 01:00:28,419

You have sinned with her?
- I, Suppose.

665
01:00:34,232 --> 01:00:36,253
Offcourse.

666
01:00:36,254 --> 01:00:39,564
And I, Don`t suppose,
- You want the absolution.

667
01:00:39,565 --> 01:00:41,627
No.
-No?

668
01:00:41,628 --> 01:00:46,894
So, Why are you here, Syracuse?

669
01:00:46,895 --> 01:00:50,311
You know the storie about the king?
- Who had a secrect.

670
01:00:50,312 --> 01:00:54,957
It drove him mad, So...
- He told it to the tree.

671
01:00:54,958 --> 01:00:59,770
Okee, Son, Pertend I`m a tree...

672
01:01:00,278 --> 01:01:05,311
She brings me luck, And, I don`t know why..

673
01:01:07,223 --> 01:01:09,892
I`m afraid, Father..

674
01:01:10,284 --> 01:01:12,579
Cause..

675
01:01:12,927 --> 01:01:16,458
I`m beginning to hope..

676
01:01:16,931 --> 01:01:19,313
We should never lose hope,
- Syracuse.

677
01:01:19,314 --> 01:01:22,379
She was drown father,
- Mine net brought her back to life.

678
01:01:22,380 --> 01:01:24,176
It doesn`t make sense.
- I know.

679
01:01:24,177 --> 01:01:26,748
None of them make sense,
That`s why, I`m afraid.

680
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:31,394
I know somethings going to happend,
- Something wonderfull.

681
01:01:31,395 --> 01:01:34,406
Or terrible..

682
01:01:35,934 --> 01:01:39,198
She is the kind a girl she is.

683
01:01:39,992 --> 01:01:43,517
She is the kind a person she is.

684
01:01:44,697 --> 01:01:48,009
And that is my secret.

685
01:01:49,303 --> 01:01:52,613

Hey, you Syracuse?

01:02:17,018 --> 01:02:19,726
What do you call her?

695

747
01:08:14,153 --> 01:08:19,400
Have you got your lights on, Hey?
- The cops will get you if you don`t.

748
01:08:39,269 --> 01:08:41,205
Maybe it is all a lie.

749
01:08:41,206 --> 01:08:46,618
Maybe you walked in to the sea,
- To get away from a bad marriage.

750
01:08:46,619 --> 01:08:48,434
Would you believe that?

751
01:08:48,435 --> 01:08:51,392

01:09:15,147 --> 01:09:18,205

So why are you here?

779
01:11:41,312 --> 01:11:43,701
Do you speak their language now?

01:11:47,126 --> 01:11:51,791
I wish you where dead.
- None of us have that luck.

782

787
01:12:10,035 --> 01:12:11,782
About what?

788
01:12:11,783 --> 01:12:15,813
She came from nowhere. Drunk.

789
01:12:15,814 --> 01:12:18,404
They should talk to her not me.

790
01:12:18,405 --> 01:12:23,671
Tell them that, I will.
- And then you tell me.

791
01:12:23,751 --> 01:12:26,613
Nothing.

792
01:12:44,489 --> 01:12:47,159

Why aren`t you blaming me?

803
01:13:44,182 --> 01:13:46,564
Just for once you had nothing to do with it.

804
01:13:46,565 --> 01:13:48,820
Why do if feel if as i did?

805
01:13:48,821 --> 01:13:53,392
Beacause you are Circus,
- You get everything wrong.

806
01:13:57,906 --> 01:14:00,961
I met him on this ferry.

807
01:14:00,962 --> 01:14:03,857
Where was, I?

808
01:14:03,858 --> 01:14:07,892

Take Annie home, When she`s stronger then i,
- Get out of this thing. I can`t..go up.

That`s what you have always wanted, Ins`t it?
- Yes.

811
01:14:19,992 --> 01:14:23,471
So, you got it.

But, I don`t want that woman there.

813
01:14:27,422 --> 01:14:30,004

Maura, I don`t
- Show some respect, It is his funeral.

818
01:15:03,938 --> 01:15:06,063
Get rid of her , Circus.

819
01:15:06,064 --> 01:15:09,331
Who?
- Your waterbaby.

820
01:15:09,332 --> 01:15:13,111
She brings good luck than bad.

821
01:15:37,186 --> 01:15:40,297
Two more Maggie.

822
01:15:56,076 --> 01:15:58,960

01:16:14,733 --> 01:16:17,456
Property of the finder.

01:16:32,127 --> 01:16:37,340
Why are you looking at me like that?
- Cause you are a Selkie.

825
01:16:37,434 --> 01:16:40,109
I`m a alcoholic.

01:22:09,762 --> 01:22:14,051
You fell of the wagon?
-..Bigtime..

871
01:22:15,226 --> 01:22:17,901
Circus of fools.

872
01:22:17,902 --> 01:22:22,088
I was turning around the big tub.

873
01:22:23,890 --> 01:22:27,893
I`m back in saw-dust now.

874
01:22:27,894 --> 01:22:31,346
And it takes like shit.

875
01:22:35,957 --> 01:22:39,214
You know what my problem is, Buddy?

876
01:22:39,215 --> 01:22:42,725
You can`t take good luck.

877
01:22:44,621 --> 01:22:48,233
Ten out of then, Sherlock.

878
01:22:48,606 --> 01:22:51,923
Misery is easy, Syracuse.

879
01:22:51,924 --> 01:22:55,174
Happines you have to work at.

880
01:22:55,234 --> 01:22:57,890
Why didn`t the tree say that?

881
01:22:57,891 --> 01:23:01,209
The tree is not going to tell you anything.

882
01:23:05,735 --> 01:23:09,584
What a bout the girl?
- Ah.. She`s gone.

883
01:23:10,110 --> 01:23:11,927
And Annie?

884
01:23:11,928 --> 01:23:13,997
She`s getting out today.

885
01:23:13,998 --> 01:23:16,633
I am taking her home with me.

886
01:23:16,634 --> 01:23:21,420
After that, There is no..Choices,
- Is there buddy.

887
01:23:22,594 --> 01:23:24,738
No.

888
01:23:25,311 --> 01:23:27,300
Why are you crying?

889
01:23:27,301 --> 01:23:30,603
I am not,
- Yes, You are i can tell.

890
01:23:30,604 --> 01:23:35,295
Maybe because you are back in the road again.
- You are home.

891
01:23:35,296 --> 01:23:39,948
Where is Ondine?
- Ondine... Had to go for a while..

892
01:23:39,949 --> 01:23:43,959
That`s why you cry ?
- It`s not, I swear.

893
01:23:43,960 --> 01:23:47,310
Did her husband come?
- It must have.

894
01:23:47,311 --> 01:23:51,329
Cause she`s gone,
- On sea business.

895
01:23:51,330 --> 01:23:53,971
She will be back you know.
- Do you think.

896
01:23:53,972 --> 01:23:56,722
I know,
- She left something here.

897
01:23:56,723 --> 01:23:59,466
What?

898
01:24:07,096 --> 01:24:10,939
What time is it ?
- Half one.

899
01:24:11,337 --> 01:24:16,058
Why didn`t you wake me?
- Cause you where sleeping like a baby.

900
01:24:16,059 --> 01:24:21,146
I tought you where the baby,
- It doesn`t look like it.

901
01:24:22,755 --> 01:24:27,060
You want breakfast ?
- Lunch.

902
01:24:30,010 --> 01:24:32,920
There you are baby.

903
01:24:58,437 --> 01:25:00,399
Annie, That song.

904
01:25:00,400 --> 01:25:03,636
What song ?
- Just a minute ago.

905
01:25:10,711 --> 01:25:16,273
It`s real.
- Off course it`s real, Sigur Rs.

906
01:25:30,089 --> 01:25:32,471
Annie, I have to go out for a bit.

907
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:34,802
I`l take you to your moms.
- No.

908
01:25:34,803 --> 01:25:38,819
I can`t leave you on your own.
- Yes you can, I feel much better.

909
01:25:38,820 --> 01:25:41,483
Are you sure?

910
01:25:41,484 --> 01:25:45,102
You have got some unfinished sea business?

911
01:25:45,462 --> 01:25:47,483
I suppose.

912
01:25:47,484 --> 01:25:49,046
Go on then.

913
01:25:49,047 --> 01:25:52,897
I`m kind a busy here any way.

914
01:27:11,908 --> 01:27:16,278
There were seals down there.
- Blasting on the rock.

915
01:27:16,279 --> 01:27:18,280
Mine kind, Ha.

916
01:27:18,281 --> 01:27:23,695
I didn`t say that,
- No, But you thought it.

917
01:27:25,597 --> 01:27:28,841
And the storm came up.

918
01:27:28,842 --> 01:27:34,990
They slipt in to the water one by one.
-..I was going to joined them...

919
01:27:38,654 --> 01:27:41,951
What changed your mind?

920
01:27:42,612 --> 01:27:45,922
What changed yours?

921
01:27:48,932 --> 01:27:53,405
She was switching channel`s on the T.V.

922
01:27:53,665 --> 01:27:55,652
Your song came on.

923
01:27:55,653 --> 01:27:58,965
It was never mine song.

924
01:28:00,339 --> 01:28:05,257
So, Tell me,
- No, Take me home.

925
01:28:05,258 --> 01:28:09,006
Where is home?
- Where do you think ?

926
01:28:09,978 --> 01:28:13,014
You tell me the truth now.

927
01:28:13,015 --> 01:28:16,305
The truth?

928
01:28:16,306 --> 01:28:20,310
The truth is, I`m a creature from the sea,
- That found her a sealcoat...

929
01:28:20,311 --> 01:28:23,019
And buryd it, Because she found a family,
- That she liked.

930
01:28:23,020 --> 01:28:25,676
Please.

931
01:28:25,677 --> 01:28:28,520
That`s..ehh.

932
01:28:28,801 --> 01:28:31,443
That`s one truth.

933
01:28:31,444 --> 01:28:34,709
You don`t want to know the other.

934
01:28:35,456 --> 01:28:38,500
Try me.

935
01:28:39,467 --> 01:28:42,310
Oke.

936
01:28:44,153 --> 01:28:48,838
I`m a prisoner and a drug mule from Romania.

937
01:28:48,839 --> 01:28:52,250
I said, The real truth.

938
01:28:54,879 --> 01:28:58,209
This is the real truth.

939
01:28:58,210 --> 01:29:03,159
I was on a boat, With a kilo of heroine in a backpack.

940
01:29:03,183 --> 01:29:07,564
The coastguard came Vladic let me swim for it,
- Vladic.

941
01:29:07,565 --> 01:29:10,191
My Selkie husband.

942
01:29:10,192 --> 01:29:12,774
Mine Peshta. (Pimp)

943
01:29:34,128 --> 01:29:37,338
He was like a monster,
- From a fairytail.

944
01:29:37,339 --> 01:29:40,380
But, He couldn`t swim.

945
01:29:40,381 --> 01:29:43,807
So, He made me take to the water.

946
01:29:44,994 --> 01:29:47,723
I was always a good swimmer.

947
01:29:47,724 --> 01:29:51,777
But, Your Irishe waves woar me down.

948
01:29:52,490 --> 01:29:56,556
I swam til i couldn`t swim no more.

949
01:29:56,802 --> 01:30:00,113
Then i floated.

950
01:30:00,360 --> 01:30:03,639
Then i sank.

951
01:30:05,052 --> 01:30:08,162
It was olmost an relief.

952
01:30:10,679 --> 01:30:15,404
I said, Here goes..

953
01:30:15,405 --> 01:30:19,002
I die..

954
01:30:26,926 --> 01:30:30,469
And that is the truth.

955
01:30:32,753 --> 01:30:36,563
You brought me back to life.

956
01:30:36,758 --> 01:30:40,795
I found a caravan,
- A family.

957
01:30:42,304 --> 01:30:45,802
Now its gone oke.

958
01:30:46,516 --> 01:30:49,766
The caravan is going nowhere.

959
01:30:57,155 --> 01:31:00,479
What is your real name?

960
01:31:04,052 --> 01:31:06,451
Joanna.

961
01:31:06,852 --> 01:31:09,447
Joanna.

962
01:31:17,907 --> 01:31:21,230
Just, Tell her you where all  your way on sea business.

963
01:31:21,231 --> 01:31:24,762
Sea business?

964
01:31:29,240 --> 01:31:31,289
I told him nothing.
- Told who?

965
01:31:31,290 --> 01:31:33,278
Not true, Little girl.

966
01:31:33,279 --> 01:31:37,878
You told us a bout the seven tears.
- And the Selkie island.

967
01:31:37,918 --> 01:31:39,946
And how Ondine came out of the water.

968
01:31:39,947 --> 01:31:43,218
But, It is nothing important.
- I swear.

969
01:31:43,317 --> 01:31:46,013
Seven tears are important.
- Surely.

970
01:31:46,014 --> 01:31:47,989
And the Selkie island.

971
01:31:47,990 --> 01:31:53,417
Still some details, I got to get more clear,

01:36:07,650 --> 01:36:12,418
<i>Her solicitor said that, she will be departed,
