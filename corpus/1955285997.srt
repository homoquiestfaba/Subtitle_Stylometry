[NICK] So Tyler's been living with me
for about five years, but I've known him

180
00:21:21,480 --> 00:21:23,562
pretty much since I moved here.

181
00:21:23,680 --> 00:21:29,050
And if he's at home, that means that Hannah
and Mae and Griffin are probably there,

182
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,527
cos they/re kinda like
our unofficial room-mates.

183
00:21:31,640 --> 00:21:35,770
Unlike Danielle, who's our official room-mate,
which means she pays rent.

184

She's only been there for a little vvhile,
but she seems pretty cool.

Er, she's getting her undergraduate
and she's...

you home, you know.
