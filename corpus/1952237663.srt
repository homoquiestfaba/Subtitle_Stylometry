1
00:01:48,241 --> 00:01:52,007
Then I took it out to eat it.

2
00:01:54,447 --> 00:01:56,005
It was…

3
00:01:57,617 --> 00:01:59,084
this big.

4
00:01:59,819 --> 00:02:05,780
Yellow, tasty looking sponge cake.

5
00:02:06,226 --> 00:02:08,490
I held it in my bosom all day.

6
00:02:10,630 --> 00:02:15,294
Then I saw a girl carrying
her sister on her back.

7
00:02:16,136 --> 00:02:18,604
Looked obvious
they were starving.

8
00:02:19,539 --> 00:02:25,808
So pale, weak and helpless

9
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:31,675
I turned away to eat it.

10
00:02:32,218 --> 00:02:35,984
But I ended up giving it to them.

11
00:02:37,524 --> 00:02:41,290
It must've been warm since

12
00:02:41,728 --> 00:02:44,993
I carried it around all day.

13
00:02:47,333 --> 00:02:53,602
I didn't know if I'll ever
have cake like that again.

14
00:02:57,644 --> 00:03:02,513
She gobbled it down and shoved
some in her sisters mouth.

15
00:03:03,917 --> 00:03:07,620
Think God will remember that?

16
00:03:07,620 --> 00:03:09,485
Though its been 30 years?

17
00:03:12,225 --> 00:03:13,487
Absoposilutely.

18
00:03:14,127 --> 00:03:16,041
Remembering is His specialty.

19
00:03:16,930 --> 00:03:18,090
Of course.

20
00:03:18,831 --> 00:03:27,603
That song, Father Can you
play it for me, again?

21
00:03:50,230 --> 00:03:52,095
You can do CPR, right?

22
00:03:55,635 --> 00:03:56,602
Go!

23
00:03:59,138 --> 00:04:00,105
Stop!

24
00:04:03,543 --> 00:04:04,510
Again!

25
00:04:16,623 --> 00:04:17,590
200 Joules.

26
00:04:30,036 --> 00:04:31,003
Charge.

27
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:40,546
Those who seek direct communication
with God are prone to self-hatred…

28
00:04:40,546 --> 00:04:42,849
The Devil will eat right into you.

29
00:04:42,849 --> 00:04:46,611
As St Bruno said, “Suicide
is to die a martyr for Satan.”

30
00:04:47,220 --> 00:04:50,189
It's worse than first degree murder.

31
00:04:50,823 --> 00:04:53,199
It's worth a life sentence…
in hell.

32
00:04:55,828 --> 00:04:58,231
20 Hail Mary's, get
lots of sun

33
00:04:58,231 --> 00:04:59,789
and take a cold shower.

34
00:05:00,033 --> 00:05:06,404
Get Gods help through science
and take some anti-depressants

35
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,103
Stop thinking about
killing yourself.

36
00:05:10,143 --> 00:05:14,204
And… forget the
bastard who dumped you.

37
00:05:21,621 --> 00:05:22,781
Father…

38
00:05:24,023 --> 00:05:27,455
I'll deal with the bastards
and the worldly matters.

39
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,672
You just stick to praying, Father.

40
00:05:31,831 --> 00:05:35,494
Ask the bishop to send
me to Emmanuel Labs, please?

41
00:05:37,036 --> 00:05:41,996
The Vatican does not
approve of that experiment.

42
00:05:43,543 --> 00:05:47,707
Sarah died on Monday
even after 8 surgeries.

43
00:05:48,247 --> 00:05:50,623
Hyo-sung went into
a coma yesterday.

44
00:05:52,118 --> 00:05:55,281
It kills me to watch them dying.

45
00:05:56,022 --> 00:06:01,187
No one knows what
really goes on at that lab.

46
00:06:03,029 --> 00:06:05,293
I want to save people.

47
00:06:07,834 --> 00:06:11,197
I told you to go to med school
since you were in the crib,

48
00:06:11,237 --> 00:06:14,540
study ophthalmology,
and heal my eyes.

49
00:06:14,540 --> 00:06:17,243
But Father, I must go and…

50
00:06:17,243 --> 00:06:20,110
Enough! I'll just give you absolution.

51
00:06:23,816 --> 00:06:26,376
Stick to the confession!
Geeze!

52
00:06:30,022 --> 00:06:33,982
<i>Dear patients, I regret not
seeing you before I left.</i>

53
00:06:34,727 --> 00:06:38,093
<i>I was busy preparing
for my sudden vacation.</i>

54
00:06:39,332 --> 00:06:41,596
<i>I packed a bunch of things.</i>

55
00:06:42,435 --> 00:06:44,197
<i>But they say to bring my body only.</i>

56
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:48,241
<i>The monastery prepared a
luxurious hotel for me.</i>

57
00:06:48,241 --> 00:06:54,379
<i>Fr. Emmanuel Memorial Biochemical Labs
At times like this I'm glad I joined The Order.</i>

58
00:06:55,248 --> 00:06:57,876
EV, namely Emmanuel Virus.

59
00:06:58,217 --> 00:07:01,584
When infected with it,
the symptoms are…

60
00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:05,124
First, blisters start
to form at the limbs,

61
00:07:05,124 --> 00:07:08,428
then around the lips
eyelids, inside the nose,

62
00:07:08,428 --> 00:07:10,390
then spreads to the
middle of the body

63
00:07:10,430 --> 00:07:13,334
through the respiratory
and digestive tracts

64
00:07:13,833 --> 00:07:18,293
The blisters cluster together
get bigger, and burst open.

65
00:07:18,638 --> 00:07:20,500
If the lesions form in the muscles,

66
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:23,843
it can form big ulcers
and will hemorrhage.

67
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:26,145
If it reaches the
internal organs,

68
00:07:26,145 --> 00:07:28,207
the patient will start
coughing up a lot of blood,

69
00:07:28,247 --> 00:07:30,953
and eventually die
of excessive bleeding.

70
00:07:31,217 --> 00:07:32,684
There is no cure.

71
00:07:33,019 --> 00:07:36,517
So if you were to get
infected during the experiment…

72
00:07:38,424 --> 00:07:39,982
all is lost.

73
00:07:42,028 --> 00:07:42,995
Now.

74
00:07:44,430 --> 00:07:46,591
Instead of the usual answer.

75
00:07:47,233 --> 00:07:51,391
What is your real purpose for
volunteering for this experiment?

76
00:07:52,038 --> 00:07:55,701
On occasion, some people come
here thinking prayer is useless.

77
00:07:55,741 --> 00:07:59,107
and with the intent to
commit a “dramatic suicide”.

78
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:02,013
That is very discouraging for us.

79
00:08:03,916 --> 00:08:05,178
By nature…

80
00:08:06,319 --> 00:08:08,381
it's hard to distinguish
the state of mind of

81
00:08:08,421 --> 00:08:12,187
those who want
martyrdom or suicide.

82
00:08:12,825 --> 00:08:15,861
I expect you're not
someone like that are you?

83
00:08:16,629 --> 00:08:18,392
Are you sure about this?

84
00:08:18,631 --> 00:08:20,394
My prayers work fine.

85
00:08:20,733 --> 00:08:24,294
Please look at
the camera and speak.

86
00:08:32,645 --> 00:08:35,308
Since Father Emmanuel
isolated the virus,

87
00:08:35,348 --> 00:08:39,118
there's not been one African
among the 600 victims.

88
00:08:39,118 --> 00:08:41,921
They've all been
Caucasians or Asians.

89
00:08:41,921 --> 00:08:45,424
And over 80% of them
have been missionaries,

90
00:08:45,424 --> 00:08:47,187
namely single males.

91
00:08:47,727 --> 00:08:51,491
That's why the people here call
the disease the “Curse of Bazira”.

92
00:08:51,531 --> 00:08:53,593
Bazira is the goddess
of widows.

93
00:08:53,633 --> 00:08:56,395
First, we administer the
vaccine we have developed,

94
00:08:56,435 --> 00:08:59,302
then an inactive
EV inside the body.

95
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:02,839
Then we observe if the
vaccine functions properly.

96
00:09:04,243 --> 00:09:08,599
<i>Grant me the following in the name
of our Lord Jesus Christ</i>

97
00:09:09,348 --> 00:09:12,978
<i>Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.</i>

98
00:09:13,819 --> 00:09:18,085
<i>Like a cripple without limbs,
let me not move freely.</i>

99
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:24,020
<i>Remove my cheeks,
that tears may not roll down them.</i>

100
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:28,722
<i>Crush my lips and tongue,
that I may not sin with them.</i>

101
00:09:29,035 --> 00:09:32,538
<i>Pull out my nails
that I may grasp nothing.</i>

102
00:09:32,538 --> 00:09:36,894
<i>Let my shoulders and back be bent
that I may carry nothing.</i>

103
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:42,836
<i>Like a man with tumor in the head
let me lack judgment.</i>

104
00:09:44,016 --> 00:09:47,980
<i>Ravage my body sworn to chastity
leave me with no pride,</i>

105
00:09:48,020 --> 00:09:50,198
<i>and have me live in shame.</i>

106
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:53,526
<i>Let no one pray for me.</i>

107
00:09:53,526 --> 00:09:58,014
<i>But only the grace of the Lord
Jesus Christ have mercy on me.</i>

108
00:10:07,039 --> 00:10:09,349
<i>A month has gone by already.</i>

109
00:10:09,542 --> 00:10:14,411
<i>Watching the grand view through
the window is more fun than TV.</i>

110
00:10:16,248 --> 00:10:17,977
<i>The hotel owner gave me
her best room,</i>

111
00:10:18,017 --> 00:10:20,383
<i>saying I'm handsome.</i>

112
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:25,845
<i>Thanks to all the sunlight
my skin is tanned and peeling.</i>

113
00:11:56,348 --> 00:11:59,181
<i>Time of death, 3:31 p.m.</i>

114
00:12:11,831 --> 00:12:13,192
<i>Grant me the following</i>

115
00:12:13,232 --> 00:12:16,136
<i>in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.</i>

116
00:12:17,236 --> 00:12:20,899
<i>Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.</i>

117
00:12:21,841 --> 00:12:23,002
<i>Like a cripple without limbs…</i>

118
00:12:23,042 --> 00:12:25,203
His skin…

119
00:12:27,146 --> 00:12:29,126
<i>let me not move freely…</i>

120
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:32,481
<i>6 months later</i>

121
00:12:44,730 --> 00:12:46,632
Touch my leg, Father!

122
00:12:46,632 --> 00:12:49,635
Please pray for me, Father!

123
00:12:49,635 --> 00:12:51,193
Please, Father?

124
00:12:52,037 --> 00:12:55,006
My daughter has leukemia!

125
00:13:12,625 --> 00:13:14,286
I heard…

126
00:13:15,528 --> 00:13:20,295
people are coming to seek prayers
from The Bandaged Saint?

127
00:13:21,133 --> 00:13:23,575
Don't know how that
nonsense started.

128
00:13:28,941 --> 00:13:32,043
Though I did hear
of some people getting cured.

129
00:13:33,345 --> 00:13:36,051
Guess it can have
a psychological effect.

130
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:41,606
After all, you're the only one
who survived out of 50 volunteers.

131
00:13:43,522 --> 00:13:44,489
Right?

132
00:13:47,326 --> 00:13:51,990
Wow! You're so lucky!

133
00:14:07,947 --> 00:14:11,280
Are you the miracle
survivor out of 500?

134
00:14:12,017 --> 00:14:15,180
My son has cancer!

135
00:14:16,222 --> 00:14:18,782
Please pray for him!

136
00:14:20,726 --> 00:14:24,787
It's just a psychological effect
Theres nothing I can do.

137
00:14:29,034 --> 00:14:30,496
Channel 9 won't come on, Mom.

138
00:14:30,536 --> 00:14:31,798
Let's pray kids.

139
00:14:37,843 --> 00:14:42,007
Did you ever live in Busan?

140
00:14:44,817 --> 00:14:49,083
We are gathered here
to pray for Kang-woo.

141
00:14:50,522 --> 00:14:52,990
Born under Your grace and love,

142
00:14:54,126 --> 00:14:57,391
embracing even
a wounded street dog…

143
00:14:58,530 --> 00:15:00,998
he was a kind hearted boy.

144
00:15:01,734 --> 00:15:04,638
Remember his goodness
and have mercy on him.

145
00:15:05,037 --> 00:15:08,040
In Jesus' name we pray.

146
00:15:08,040 --> 00:15:09,007
–Amen.
–Amen.

147
00:15:11,443 --> 00:15:18,281
I don't believe in this
but since it's from an old friend…

148
00:15:23,322 --> 00:15:25,085
Now, I recognize you, son.

149
00:15:25,925 --> 00:15:27,773
Sorry. You're a Father, now.

150
00:15:30,329 --> 00:15:32,092
I'm sorry, Father.

151
00:15:35,434 --> 00:15:38,403
You used to come over
for noodles.

152
00:15:38,537 --> 00:15:42,803
Fifth grade, right?
You lived at the church orphanage?

153
00:15:44,243 --> 00:15:46,105
My son could never pass stray

154
00:15:46,145 --> 00:15:49,808
cats and was so good
to the orphans.

155
00:15:50,215 --> 00:15:53,911
Your sister was so shy and
ran out whenever I came over.

156
00:15:55,020 --> 00:15:59,582
She had calluses on her feet
and Kang-woo made me touch them.

157
00:16:04,430 --> 00:16:07,797
Her parents rented
a small room in our house.

158
00:16:09,435 --> 00:16:12,893
Her father was
a high school drop out.

159
00:16:13,439 --> 00:16:18,399
This is my blood shed for
you so that sins may be forgiven.

160
00:16:18,644 --> 00:16:23,980
One day, they left her in my room
and said they'd be back soon.

161
00:16:24,717 --> 00:16:26,378
But they never came back!

162
00:16:27,419 --> 00:16:30,222
So I took the three-year-old

163
00:16:30,222 --> 00:16:33,191
in and raised her
like a daughter and puppy.

164
00:16:33,625 --> 00:16:36,265
<i>Happy Hanbok</i>
Shed call me “mommy”

165
00:16:36,428 --> 00:16:38,293
I'm her mommy-in-law, now.

166
00:16:41,834 --> 00:16:44,098
Marriage was no big deal.

167
00:16:44,636 --> 00:16:48,299
She just moved from sleeping
in my bed to Kang-woo's.

168
00:16:51,543 --> 00:16:56,310
Why'd you buy the laver
at that place again, Mom?

169
00:16:57,316 --> 00:17:04,882
I told you it's no good and
the owner's a cocksucker

170
00:17:36,221 --> 00:17:37,586
You hate Kimbap?

171
00:17:38,624 --> 00:17:42,082
No, I'm sensitive to smell
these days.

172
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:45,490
I suddenly got a whiff of blood.

173
00:17:50,135 --> 00:17:51,500
Kang-woos home.

174
00:17:52,638 --> 00:17:54,740
–Mom, I caught a cold!
–What?

175
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,141
Hi, Sang-hyun!

176
00:17:56,141 --> 00:17:58,203
I told you
to wear your long johns.

177
00:17:58,243 --> 00:18:01,110
–Were here, too
–Welcome.

178
00:18:02,247 --> 00:18:03,633
My friend the priest.

179
00:18:04,016 --> 00:18:06,718
This is our dam's
manager and his wife.

180
00:18:06,718 --> 00:18:10,222
It's an honor, Father
I'm Young-du

181
00:18:10,222 --> 00:18:13,125
She's a Filipina
so she's Catholic.

182
00:18:13,125 --> 00:18:15,184
Say hello, Evelyn.

183
00:18:23,635 --> 00:18:27,503
–Tae-ju!
–How've you been?

184
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:36,771
Here comes the Police Chief!

185
00:18:37,116 --> 00:18:42,179
Please, I quit
the force a long time ago.

186
00:18:43,622 --> 00:18:46,085
He's the dam's security
head This is Fr. Hyun, Sang-hyun

187
00:18:46,125 --> 00:18:47,226
Hello.

188
00:18:47,226 --> 00:18:48,787
Do you like fishing Father?

189
00:18:48,827 --> 00:18:53,532
Get on his good side and you
can fish there though its banned.

190
00:18:53,532 --> 00:18:56,195
Daytimes a bit tricky.
Come by at nights.

191
00:18:56,235 --> 00:18:59,295
–Have a seat, Father
–Let's get started.

192
00:19:03,942 --> 00:19:08,402
Koreans don't
appreciate Mahjong.

193
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:13,619
Would you like to play, Father?

194
00:19:13,619 --> 00:19:16,588
–Sorry. I don't know how
–I see.

195
00:19:18,624 --> 00:19:22,492
Did I tell you about Father Hyun
praying for Kang-woo?

196
00:19:24,429 --> 00:19:27,887
I was standing right
next to my son.

197
00:19:28,333 --> 00:19:33,338
Suddenly, I felt something hot
come down on my head.

198
00:19:33,338 --> 00:19:39,607
I felt tingly all over like
someone was poking me with needles.

199
00:19:42,848 --> 00:19:47,876
Then my boy said
“It feels hot right here, Mom.”

200
00:19:51,123 --> 00:19:53,489
Then the cancer vanished.

201
00:19:54,026 --> 00:19:55,288
It vanished?

202
00:19:57,930 --> 00:20:00,592
You always feel tingly
cuz of your blood pressure.

203
00:20:00,632 --> 00:20:03,192
But I did a biopsy just in case.

204
00:20:05,637 --> 00:20:10,199
The endoscope showed
it was esophagus cancer.

205
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,606
Women shouldn't
get sedated endoscopes.

206
00:20:14,046 --> 00:20:18,278
Doctors secretly rape them.

207
00:20:24,923 --> 00:20:26,083
I win!

208
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,395
Three closed triplets!

209
00:20:30,829 --> 00:20:32,387
That's 8 points.

210
00:20:36,435 --> 00:20:40,303
Can we turn the heater down?

211
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:42,006
But I'm cold.

212
00:20:44,643 --> 00:20:46,227
Kang-woo says he's cold!

213
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,374
Thank you very much.

214
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:19,105
I'm losing so much.

215
00:21:19,845 --> 00:21:22,313
Instead of the hot water bag!

216
00:21:55,347 --> 00:21:58,383
I'm going down to get
the lights in the store.

217
00:23:09,621 --> 00:23:11,733
Don't you love our Mahjong gang?

218
00:23:16,428 --> 00:23:18,730
Wednesdays. Mercury. Water.

219
00:23:18,730 --> 00:23:21,290
Oasis! How's that
for our gang's name?

220
00:26:27,218 --> 00:26:29,482
She's a Catholic Veronica.

221
00:26:30,722 --> 00:26:32,690
She was in a bad hit-and-run.

222
00:26:34,826 --> 00:26:36,589
Lost a lot of blood.

223
00:26:37,028 --> 00:26:38,810
She doesn't have much time.

224
00:26:44,235 --> 00:26:46,298
Let this water call to mind
your baptismal sharing…

225
00:26:46,338 --> 00:26:50,502
in Christ's redeeming
passion and resurrection.

226
00:26:52,143 --> 00:26:55,306
Veronica. Make your confession.

227
00:27:16,935 --> 00:27:22,140
By the power the apostolic See
has given me in the name of the…

228
00:27:22,140 --> 00:27:24,002
Father, the Son,
and the Holy Spirit, I grant you

229
00:27:24,042 --> 00:27:25,692
a plenary indulgence and…

230
00:27:30,615 --> 00:27:32,617
pardon for all your sins.

231
00:27:32,617 --> 00:27:33,584
Amen.

232
00:27:37,522 --> 00:27:40,082
Through this holy anointing…

233
00:27:42,427 --> 00:27:45,331
may the Lord in his
love and mercy help you…

234
00:27:47,132 --> 00:27:50,397
with the grace of the Holy Spirit.

235
00:27:53,038 --> 00:27:54,096
And…

236
00:27:55,240 --> 00:27:57,708
may the Lord who
frees you from sin…

237
00:27:58,643 --> 00:28:02,704
save you and raise you up.

238
00:28:04,816 --> 00:28:05,680
Amen.

239
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:43,708
Where'd you wander
off to this time?

240
00:31:45,436 --> 00:31:48,439
I woke up I was at the pharmacy.

241
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:50,498
And some man walked past.

242
00:31:51,442 --> 00:31:53,818
Aren't there pills
for sleepwalking?

243
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:57,675
I should lock your room
from the outside.

244
00:31:57,715 --> 00:32:00,025
Should've got me pills
for my cold.

245
00:32:01,319 --> 00:32:02,441
Weren't you cold?

246
00:32:03,021 --> 00:32:04,682
You never catch a cold.

247
00:32:08,226 --> 00:32:09,784
She's a Yeti, Mom.

248
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:21,747
Smells like
when you had gastritis.

249
00:32:21,839 --> 00:32:23,704
I'll go find the pills.

250
00:32:26,744 --> 00:32:28,905
Must you do this to believe me?

251
00:32:32,917 --> 00:32:35,784
Don't grab my heart so hard.

252
00:32:52,537 --> 00:32:55,404
When I drank Hyo-sung's blood…

253
00:32:55,740 --> 00:32:57,390
the blisters disappeared.

254
00:32:58,142 --> 00:33:00,980
It's as if the vampire cells
suppressed EV.

255
00:33:02,447 --> 00:33:04,493
But, it doesn't last very long.

256
00:33:06,617 --> 00:33:07,584
Father…

257
00:33:08,419 --> 00:33:11,983
I didn't choose the blood
that was transfused into me!

258
00:33:12,523 --> 00:33:14,787
You know I went
there to do good!

259
00:33:20,431 --> 00:33:23,195
Now, I thirst after
all sinful pleasures.

260
00:33:24,335 --> 00:33:28,101
But how can I get human
blood without killing!

261
00:33:28,740 --> 00:33:29,707
First…

262
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,611
The Lord said not to worry
about what to eat.

263
00:33:34,045 --> 00:33:36,619
For He feeds even
the birds in the sky.

264
00:33:36,814 --> 00:33:37,781
Here.

265
00:33:57,635 --> 00:33:58,693
I think I won.

266
00:33:59,937 --> 00:34:02,201
Small four winds!

267
00:34:02,840 --> 00:34:05,150
Closed, half flush,
bonus 3 points!

268
00:34:06,444 --> 00:34:08,412
30 bucks! You lose!

269
00:34:11,516 --> 00:34:15,077
Some priest.
From Macao or something?

270
00:34:15,420 --> 00:34:20,881
He's the only one
who survived out of 500.

271
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,786
500, yeah right.

272
00:35:00,031 --> 00:35:01,396
When did you go out?

273
00:35:02,333 --> 00:35:04,198
I didn't see you.

274
00:35:53,417 --> 00:35:57,183
It's ah…
kind of an infectious disease.

275
00:35:58,723 --> 00:35:59,779
Scary, isn't it?

276
00:36:00,625 --> 00:36:03,594
How different…
without his glasses.

277
00:36:06,330 --> 00:36:07,991
How can you get infected?

278
00:36:10,334 --> 00:36:12,996
Not through a kiss for sure.

279
00:36:13,538 --> 00:36:16,302
I never kissed
anyone in my life.

280
00:36:20,845 --> 00:36:21,903
Until now.

281
00:36:50,841 --> 00:36:53,207
I don't get shy.

282
00:36:55,246 --> 00:36:57,271
I didn't run out cuz I'm shy.

283
00:36:58,616 --> 00:37:01,483
Back in Busan…

284
00:37:02,820 --> 00:37:05,064
It's cuz I was
sick of everything.

285
00:37:10,328 --> 00:37:14,890
The mom, idiot son,
and the dark, damp house.

286
00:37:15,433 --> 00:37:18,095
The non-stop weepy, old songs.

287
00:37:25,243 --> 00:37:27,302
I waited for you to come.

288
00:37:28,346 --> 00:37:30,473
The orphanage boy…

289
00:37:32,817 --> 00:37:34,375
I waited for you…

290
00:37:35,419 --> 00:37:36,886
when I was young…

291
00:37:39,123 --> 00:37:41,091
cuz the idiot liked you.

292
00:37:42,226 --> 00:37:44,387
When you came,
he left me alone.

293
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:54,602
I'm not a shy person.

294
00:38:08,419 --> 00:38:10,387
I run out on my bare feet…

295
00:38:11,322 --> 00:38:14,291
to escape from
this hell sooner.

296
00:38:23,834 --> 00:38:25,893
I even run out from my sleep.

297
00:38:26,337 --> 00:38:28,396
They think its sleepwalking.

298
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:33,003
I feel awake only then
and asleep the rest of the time.

299
00:39:56,026 --> 00:39:57,186
Honey!

300
00:39:58,929 --> 00:39:59,987
Tae-ju!

301
00:40:00,231 --> 00:40:01,289
Hot water bag!

302
00:40:02,533 --> 00:40:03,500
Tae-ju?

303
00:40:05,736 --> 00:40:06,998
Tae-ju!

304
00:40:40,337 --> 00:40:41,599
You bitch!

305
00:40:42,239 --> 00:40:44,341
There she goes again.

306
00:40:44,341 --> 00:40:46,243
I fed you and raised you!

307
00:40:46,243 --> 00:40:49,007
Go put her to bed!

308
00:40:50,014 --> 00:40:53,177
You can't even change
your husband's hot water bag?

309
00:40:53,217 --> 00:40:56,380
How dare you!

310
00:40:56,821 --> 00:40:57,788
I win.

311
00:40:58,122 --> 00:40:59,089
Let go!

312
00:41:04,728 --> 00:41:08,432
Stomach troubles?
What took you so long?

313
00:41:08,432 --> 00:41:11,402
Eat up other's money
and you'll get diarrhea.

314
00:41:21,145 --> 00:41:22,465
What's got into you?

315
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,572
This looks fun.

316
00:41:26,717 --> 00:41:28,685
So exciting to touch.

317
00:41:31,021 --> 00:41:32,883
I could do it all night, too.

318
00:41:32,923 --> 00:41:35,101
You don't even know
how to do it.

319
00:41:35,826 --> 00:41:36,884
Me?

320
00:41:38,028 --> 00:41:39,586
I know how to do it.

321
00:41:40,731 --> 00:41:41,891
I'm good.

322
00:41:44,335 --> 00:41:47,099
They are on fire!

323
00:41:48,138 --> 00:41:51,642
I can't wait till next Wednesday.

324
00:41:51,642 --> 00:41:53,906
Then how about Sundays, too?

325
00:41:55,246 --> 00:41:56,213
Why not?

326
00:41:57,515 --> 00:41:58,482
Well…

327
00:42:00,718 --> 00:42:03,820
It's Easter Sunday
I'm staying at the hospital.

328
00:42:04,522 --> 00:42:07,491
It's best to leave things
in wanting.

329
00:42:09,527 --> 00:42:10,494
Mom…

330
00:42:13,531 --> 00:42:14,498
I…

331
00:42:16,734 --> 00:42:19,396
can't live like this anymore.

332
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:22,100
I…

333
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:27,406
I want to help the needy.

334
00:42:31,315 --> 00:42:34,773
Maybe I can volunteer
at a hospital or something.

335
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:39,280
On Sundays.

336
00:43:26,837 --> 00:43:28,395
Thank you for coming.

337
00:43:29,640 --> 00:43:31,198
Don't come again.

338
00:43:32,443 --> 00:43:35,310
But I came to help the needy.

339
00:43:38,115 --> 00:43:41,380
Its a bigger sin for a priest.

340
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:44,683
I'm not Catholic.

341
00:43:46,023 --> 00:43:48,787
To me, you're just a needy,
single man.

342
00:43:49,627 --> 00:43:53,393
We can both go to hell for this.

343
00:43:54,131 --> 00:43:56,837
I don't have faith
I'm not going to hell.

344
00:44:02,039 --> 00:44:03,199
But I…

345
00:44:06,343 --> 00:44:08,946
I have a terrible disease.

346
00:44:08,946 --> 00:44:11,471
I'm too damn healthy.

347
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:15,480
Just once,
I wish I could be sick in bed.

348
00:44:42,546 --> 00:44:43,774
It's okay.

349
00:44:45,215 --> 00:44:49,379
Hyo-sung's in a coma.

350
00:44:50,821 --> 00:44:55,087
Unless his vitals drop
no one will come in here at nights.

351
00:46:39,730 --> 00:46:42,392
Sorry, I hurt you.

352
00:46:45,936 --> 00:46:49,303
No, its good.

353
00:46:51,041 --> 00:46:52,702
Its strange, but good.

354
00:46:56,446 --> 00:46:59,779
Is it supposed to
feel this good?

355
00:47:35,419 --> 00:47:36,886
What's wrong with me?

356
00:47:39,723 --> 00:47:41,691
Are other women like this?

357
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:47,493
Am I a pervert?

358
00:51:26,316 --> 00:51:27,874
Did you eat?

359
00:51:28,618 --> 00:51:30,779
Ah, yes.

360
00:51:32,722 --> 00:51:35,384
Can we meet
during the day next week?

361
00:51:36,827 --> 00:51:38,385
Daytimes a bit…

362
00:51:39,930 --> 00:51:41,898
We could be together longer.

363
00:51:45,535 --> 00:51:48,835
I don't want to keep my disease
a secret from you.

364
00:51:50,240 --> 00:51:51,901
I am…

365
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:57,675
a kind of a…

366
00:52:47,330 --> 00:52:49,890
I don't kill anyone you know.

367
00:52:50,433 --> 00:52:52,094
Hyo-sung…

368
00:52:52,936 --> 00:52:55,803
He loved helping the hungry.

369
00:52:57,040 --> 00:53:00,305
He'd offer me his blood,
if he wasn't in a coma.

370
00:53:01,545 --> 00:53:04,673
If you only heard
the sponge cake story.

371
00:53:05,815 --> 00:53:09,581
No one blames someone
for getting hurt in an accident!

372
00:53:10,520 --> 00:53:13,226
No one gets criticized
for having cancer!

373
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:18,792
I went there to do good!

374
00:53:27,537 --> 00:53:29,698
So what if I'm a vampire?

375
00:53:31,641 --> 00:53:34,906
Did you like me cuz I'm a priest?

376
00:53:35,645 --> 00:53:38,815
Its not that, is it?
That's just my job.

377
00:53:38,815 --> 00:53:40,577
Being a vampire is
like having different palates…

378
00:53:40,617 --> 00:53:47,181
or different biorhythms
don't you think?

379
00:53:47,924 --> 00:53:51,290
When two people are in love,
does it really matter?

380
00:53:52,229 --> 00:53:53,787
No, what I mean is…

381
00:53:55,932 --> 00:53:57,780
You hate that I'm a vampire?

382
00:53:58,235 --> 00:54:01,438
Think I could've slept
with you if I wasn't?

383
00:54:01,438 --> 00:54:03,906
How could I have sex with you?

384
00:54:04,241 --> 00:54:05,902
As just a priest?

385
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:10,372
Come with me.

386
00:54:10,513 --> 00:54:12,757
I'll take you away from this hell.

387
00:54:16,419 --> 00:54:19,479
You liked doing it with me
Kang-woo's no fun.

388
00:54:25,829 --> 00:54:26,887
Tae-ju?

389
00:54:35,238 --> 00:54:36,500
What's going on?

390
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,659
The toilet's not flushing.

391
00:54:54,624 --> 00:54:56,182
It's going down now.

392
00:55:14,444 --> 00:55:15,502
Closing time.

393
00:56:06,229 --> 00:56:07,430
Hello?

394
00:56:07,430 --> 00:56:08,795
<i>How can…</i>

395
00:56:10,233 --> 00:56:12,098
someone become a vampire?

396
00:56:15,038 --> 00:56:17,506
Can you catch it through sex?

397
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:25,580
Can you turn me into one?

398
00:57:07,524 --> 00:57:12,393
Vampires are…
cuter than I thought.

399
00:57:19,936 --> 00:57:21,301
Can you bend this?

400
00:57:22,439 --> 00:57:24,100
What for?

401
00:57:43,927 --> 00:57:45,775
Can you jump down from here?

402
00:57:57,240 --> 00:57:59,003
Too high?

403
00:58:37,213 --> 00:58:38,475
I'm ready.

404
00:59:25,828 --> 00:59:27,214
Did Kang-woo do that?

405
00:59:29,532 --> 00:59:31,050
Does he hurt you often?

406
00:59:34,437 --> 00:59:36,098
Not often…

407
00:59:37,840 --> 00:59:42,209
Want me to rip him up
like that coin?

408
00:59:54,123 --> 00:59:59,584
I lived as their dog
my whole life…

409
01:00:01,130 --> 01:00:06,591
feeding the idiot, washing him
and even helping him masturbate.

410
01:00:08,338 --> 01:00:09,703
You know…

411
01:00:11,140 --> 01:00:13,404
I'm practically a virgin.

412
01:00:15,244 --> 01:00:16,108
He's…

413
01:00:17,714 --> 01:00:20,376
Does it hurt?

414
01:00:30,426 --> 01:00:34,192
Can't you volunteer
somewhere else?

415
01:00:35,131 --> 01:00:37,111
Mental hospitals are so scary.

416
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:46,909
Drink it.

417
01:00:53,616 --> 01:00:56,278
Can't you go back to the lab?

418
01:00:57,120 --> 01:01:01,580
Ask if there's any way
for a cure?

419
01:01:03,126 --> 01:01:06,289
Sunlight is bound to hit me
on my way there.

420
01:01:07,630 --> 01:01:08,790
Sunlight…

421
01:01:10,633 --> 01:01:15,593
I wish I can see the sunrise
over the sea before I die.

422
01:01:18,041 --> 01:01:20,202
What are you thinking!

423
01:01:21,744 --> 01:01:23,871
Vampires can't see the sunlight!

424
01:01:25,014 --> 01:01:27,073
I don't care if it's at night.

425
01:01:28,217 --> 01:01:33,587
The moon, the stars
and even a firefly…

426
01:01:35,224 --> 01:01:36,987
Be the miracle worker!

427
01:01:37,126 --> 01:01:39,788
Make the blind see!

428
01:01:42,131 --> 01:01:43,996
Give me the vampire blood!

429
01:01:44,434 --> 01:01:47,096
It even killed EV!

430
01:01:47,537 --> 01:01:48,938
Please, Sang-hyun!

431
01:01:48,938 --> 01:01:51,702
Come here!

432
01:01:52,842 --> 01:01:55,902
Sang-hyun! Father Hyun!

433
01:01:56,813 --> 01:01:58,872
Please!

434
01:01:59,415 --> 01:02:01,576
Just a little bit, please?

435
01:02:04,520 --> 01:02:07,387
I'm no longer
a priest nor a friar.

436
01:02:09,425 --> 01:02:12,292
Forget the rules!
Forget the Vatican!

437
01:02:13,229 --> 01:02:14,787
I'm leaving!

438
01:02:18,735 --> 01:02:21,397
Father Hyun! Father Hyun!

439
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,903
I don't know
why you wandered astray.

440
01:02:29,145 --> 01:02:33,172
But I know you'll get through this.

441
01:02:34,517 --> 01:02:38,977
I took pity on you
when you were young.

442
01:02:40,623 --> 01:02:43,490
We had you over for noodles.

443
01:02:45,428 --> 01:02:49,990
You can stay here
as long as you want.

444
01:02:50,733 --> 01:02:51,700
Thank you.

445
01:02:55,938 --> 01:02:57,803
Tae-ju…

446
01:02:59,642 --> 01:03:05,080
She's really good at heart.

447
01:03:06,516 --> 01:03:12,887
I'm giving the shop
and everything to her.

448
01:03:16,025 --> 01:03:18,186
Did I do it too hard?

449
01:03:23,533 --> 01:03:25,000
It's perfect.

450
01:03:29,539 --> 01:03:31,404
One more time, then?

451
01:03:59,435 --> 01:04:01,037
Good night.

452
01:04:01,037 --> 01:04:02,504
Sweet dreams.

453
01:05:21,317 --> 01:05:22,682
Get out! Go!

454
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:26,588
Hurry!

455
01:05:27,823 --> 01:05:31,486
Go! Someone will see you!

456
01:05:40,436 --> 01:05:41,698
No! Don't!

457
01:06:01,223 --> 01:06:07,128
♪ <i>The seagulls flying
in the distance…</i>

458
01:06:07,430 --> 01:06:13,536
♪ <i>I called, but no response.</i>

459
01:06:13,536 --> 01:06:19,041
♪ <i>O, my hometown by the waters
where bright blue stars glisten…</i>

460
01:06:19,041 --> 01:06:25,276
♪ <i>in my dreams full of sorrow.</i>

461
01:06:27,817 --> 01:06:30,127
Remember Tae-ju
when she was young?

462
01:06:31,120 --> 01:06:32,781
Wasn't she cute?

463
01:06:33,723 --> 01:06:36,025
When she was 12

464
01:06:36,025 --> 01:06:38,892
she woke me up
and showed me her panties.

465
01:06:39,729 --> 01:06:41,049
Said she peed blood.

466
01:06:43,032 --> 01:06:46,900
Cuz mom worked her day
and night with needlework.

467
01:06:48,137 --> 01:06:50,503
We cried together all night.

468
01:06:53,843 --> 01:06:57,973
Planning on taking all night?

469
01:07:01,617 --> 01:07:02,937
It's only 9 o'clock.

470
01:07:03,619 --> 01:07:07,988
The hospital and police questioning
will take hours.

471
01:07:09,225 --> 01:07:11,284
What if the sun comes up?

472
01:07:25,841 --> 01:07:27,308
I said, no!

473
01:07:28,744 --> 01:07:30,268
Just a little bit?

474
01:07:32,114 --> 01:07:34,480
They'll find out with an autopsy!

475
01:07:36,919 --> 01:07:40,480
Why go somewhere else
for blood?

476
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:42,988
We have blood right here.

477
01:07:45,227 --> 01:07:46,785
Put the knife down.

478
01:07:47,730 --> 01:07:49,197
Yeah, put it down.

479
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:56,404
No! Don't come near me!

480
01:09:33,636 --> 01:09:38,198
One female. Unconscious.
Well be going soon.

481
01:09:55,624 --> 01:10:01,392
Don't mention
that I let you fish here.

482
01:10:02,331 --> 01:10:05,095
I'll take care of everything.

483
01:10:28,023 --> 01:10:31,227
Father Hyun… Father…

484
01:10:31,227 --> 01:10:34,390
He became ill again for our sins!

485
01:10:37,132 --> 01:10:40,035
Grant me the following

486
01:10:40,035 --> 01:10:43,095
in the name of
our Lord Jesus Christ.

487
01:10:43,639 --> 01:10:48,303
Like a leper rotting in flesh,
let all avoid me.

488
01:10:48,844 --> 01:10:52,014
Like a cripple without limbs

489
01:10:52,014 --> 01:10:54,778
let me not move freely.

490
01:10:55,417 --> 01:10:57,319
Remove my cheeks

491
01:10:57,319 --> 01:11:00,288
that tears may
not roll down them.

492
01:11:02,625 --> 01:11:05,187
There was a house
at the bottom of the lake.

493
01:11:05,227 --> 01:11:06,785
A submerged village.

494
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,193
I thought he was dead.

495
01:11:11,834 --> 01:11:15,702
But when I went up
he'd float up, too.

496
01:11:16,438 --> 01:11:18,300
So I put him in a closet
in the house

497
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:21,002
and a big rock on his chest.

498
01:11:23,145 --> 01:11:25,670
What if he comes out
and chases me?

499
01:11:27,616 --> 01:11:31,074
I should've put a rock
at the closet door, too.

500
01:11:32,321 --> 01:11:34,687
Death is the end. Right Father?

501
01:11:35,924 --> 01:11:37,904
When you're dead, you're dead?

502
01:11:51,640 --> 01:11:52,607
See?

503
01:11:54,943 --> 01:11:57,468
Vampires are not immortal.

504
01:11:59,315 --> 01:12:00,899
You still want my blood?

505
01:12:04,320 --> 01:12:08,279
You want to see
this dark world that badly?

506
01:12:10,526 --> 01:12:12,790
You live on other's blood

507
01:12:13,529 --> 01:12:15,773
but won't give me
a drop of yours!

508
01:12:21,637 --> 01:12:24,475
Give me absolution and
I'll give it to you.

509
01:12:32,014 --> 01:12:35,077
God the Father of mercies,
has reconciled the world to himself

510
01:12:35,117 --> 01:12:38,678
through the death
and resurrection of his Son…

511
01:12:39,221 --> 01:12:43,313
and sent the Holy Spirit among us
for the forgiveness of sins;

512
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:45,087
through the ministry of the Church

513
01:12:45,127 --> 01:12:47,371
may God give you
pardon and peace…

514
01:12:47,730 --> 01:12:51,393
and I absolve you from your sins
in the name of the Father…

515
01:12:51,433 --> 01:12:53,395
and of the Son
and of the Holy Spirit.

516
01:12:53,435 --> 01:12:54,402
Amen.

517
01:12:55,337 --> 01:12:57,805
Let us praise the Lord.

518
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:05,675
The Lord's mercy endures forever.

519
01:13:08,217 --> 01:13:12,381
The Lord has forgiven your sins.

520
01:14:15,217 --> 01:14:16,980
Go home and rest.

521
01:14:19,321 --> 01:14:21,585
You must be tired.

522
01:14:24,726 --> 01:14:26,785
She's my only friend.

523
01:14:27,629 --> 01:14:30,792
I know shell get better
if you pray for her.

524
01:14:37,539 --> 01:14:39,006
Please.

525
01:14:42,144 --> 01:14:45,840
In the name of the Father,
the Son, and the Holy Spirit.

526
01:14:46,114 --> 01:14:47,081
Amen.

527
01:14:50,919 --> 01:14:53,786
I pray to Tae-ju.

528
01:14:54,523 --> 01:14:57,583
Please wake up
and listen to my prayer.

529
01:15:00,128 --> 01:15:03,932
I said Kang-woo was drunk
from a bottle of So-ju.

530
01:15:03,932 --> 01:15:06,992
So say the same to the cops.

531
01:15:07,936 --> 01:15:10,939
When this is all over
we will be together.

532
01:15:10,939 --> 01:15:13,806
We must not meet for a while.

533
01:15:16,044 --> 01:15:20,315
Though my face may seem
cold and rigid…

534
01:15:20,315 --> 01:15:22,476
my heart only beats for you.

535
01:15:23,819 --> 01:15:28,984
<i>When we meet again
I believe we'll finally be happy.</i>

536
01:15:31,426 --> 01:15:32,393
<i>Father?</i>

537
01:15:33,328 --> 01:15:34,989
<i>Doing it this way…</i>

538
01:15:35,531 --> 01:15:39,592
<i>feels like I'll live on inside you.</i>

539
01:16:24,713 --> 01:16:25,714
Stop all the…

540
01:16:25,714 --> 01:16:26,976
thinking, longing.

541
01:16:27,916 --> 01:16:33,582
The police needs the body
to close the case.

542
01:16:35,724 --> 01:16:43,187
Kang-woo couldn't swim, Mrs Ra
You gotta move on with your life.

543
01:16:44,333 --> 01:16:45,698
Kang-woo can swim.

544
01:16:53,542 --> 01:16:55,984
Father Hyun's still not
taking calls?

545
01:16:56,545 --> 01:16:58,393
It must've been a big shock.

546
01:17:02,217 --> 01:17:04,791
Still, he could've come
to the funeral.

547
01:17:11,627 --> 01:17:12,594
Kang-woo!

548
01:17:13,829 --> 01:17:14,796
Kang-woo!

549
01:17:19,434 --> 01:17:21,336
I'm Sang-hyun, Ma'am.

550
01:17:21,336 --> 01:17:22,854
I know I'm all wet but…

551
01:17:23,238 --> 01:17:24,398
My poor baby.

552
01:17:25,240 --> 01:17:26,942
What took you so long?

553
01:17:26,942 --> 01:17:28,705
Why didn't you call?

554
01:17:29,845 --> 01:17:33,076
Bastard! You son of a bitch!

555
01:17:35,717 --> 01:17:37,519
–Mrs Ra!
–Mrs Ra!

556
01:17:37,519 --> 01:17:39,077
Wake up Mrs Ra!

557
01:17:41,523 --> 01:17:44,788
Drink this, Mrs Ra!

558
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:52,798
This is why we should all watch
our blood pressures.

559
01:17:53,835 --> 01:17:55,200
Watch our drinking.

560
01:17:55,737 --> 01:17:57,783
And stay away from salty foods.

561
01:18:00,342 --> 01:18:07,180
Let's give Mrs Ra
our positive energy, Oasis-style.

562
01:18:07,716 --> 01:18:10,276
Starting with Tae-ju.

563
01:18:12,821 --> 01:18:13,981
Mom…

564
01:18:14,923 --> 01:18:18,188
How long's it been?

565
01:19:00,936 --> 01:19:02,403
Why are you so wet?

566
01:19:02,838 --> 01:19:03,805
What?

567
01:19:07,442 --> 01:19:08,500
Is there a leak?

568
01:19:11,613 --> 01:19:12,978
Whys it so damp?

569
01:19:18,420 --> 01:19:20,888
Come here and
stop imagining things.

570
01:19:27,729 --> 01:19:30,197
It's all psychological.

571
01:19:32,434 --> 01:19:35,206
Stop making a fuss
and will you come here?

572
01:20:30,926 --> 01:20:32,393
Was he here, too?

573
01:20:37,632 --> 01:20:38,599
He? Who?

574
01:20:41,436 --> 01:20:46,806
♪ <i>Seagulls flying
in the distance…</i>

575
01:21:57,712 --> 01:21:58,900
Don't fall for it.

576
01:21:59,514 --> 01:22:01,230
It's all just an illusion.

577
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:04,781
It's just psychological.

578
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:05,370
You're going?

579
01:23:09,417 --> 01:23:12,875
How can someone do it
five times, straight?

580
01:24:06,641 --> 01:24:10,372
Mom never once
threw me a birthday party.

581
01:24:19,220 --> 01:24:20,278
How dare you!

582
01:24:38,239 --> 01:24:42,608
But she always gave me
plenty to eat.

583
01:24:44,312 --> 01:24:45,370
Then thank her.

584
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:49,283
Thank you.

585
01:24:54,722 --> 01:24:59,127
Can't you go to that detective?

586
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:01,107
Aren't you thirsty these days?

587
01:25:06,034 --> 01:25:08,806
I'll throw you
a birthday party this year.

588
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:12,841
Really?

589
01:25:12,841 --> 01:25:15,217
The first birthday party
in my life?

590
01:25:16,544 --> 01:25:21,277
But… I don't know
when my birthday is.

591
01:25:35,730 --> 01:25:37,789
But who made you boss?

592
01:25:38,933 --> 01:25:40,195
Telling me this and that

593
01:25:40,235 --> 01:25:41,687
and hitting me around.

594
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,906
Kang-woo never laid
a hand on me.

595
01:26:32,420 --> 01:26:33,580
Did Kang-woo…

596
01:26:34,622 --> 01:26:36,180
beat you or not?

597
01:26:37,926 --> 01:26:39,587
Why does that matter?

598
01:26:41,729 --> 01:26:43,287
That's why he died!

599
01:26:44,332 --> 01:26:45,799
Don't make excuses!

600
01:26:46,834 --> 01:26:48,893
You would've killed him anyway.

601
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:53,141
So you can have me for yourself.

602
01:26:53,141 --> 01:26:56,975
Do you know how hard
I tried not to kill people?

603
01:26:59,914 --> 01:27:02,026
You can't even begin to imagine!

604
01:27:04,319 --> 01:27:07,482
A blood thirsty beast
is growling inside me!

605
01:27:08,523 --> 01:27:11,583
But I tiptoed around
afraid to hurt anyone.

606
01:27:14,729 --> 01:27:16,390
I killed him cuz of you.

607
01:27:19,334 --> 01:27:20,301
To save you.

608
01:27:23,838 --> 01:27:25,703
To save me?

609
01:27:29,043 --> 01:27:31,221
Then why am I living
a nightmare?

610
01:27:33,114 --> 01:27:36,918
I stay up trembling
at the thought of

611
01:27:36,918 --> 01:27:40,183
your cold hand touching me.

612
01:27:40,822 --> 01:27:42,142
How did this happen?

613
01:27:49,931 --> 01:27:51,091
Mom!

614
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:54,899
Mom!

615
01:27:56,137 --> 01:27:57,939
I'm done for.

616
01:27:57,939 --> 01:27:59,804
He's going to kill me.

617
01:28:00,541 --> 01:28:02,304
Poor Kang-woo…

618
01:28:03,044 --> 01:28:06,172
My poor, dear mom…

619
01:28:07,215 --> 01:28:11,379
You treated that devil like a son
and this is what you get?

620
01:28:13,221 --> 01:28:14,688
Did I do it alone?

621
01:28:15,923 --> 01:28:17,481
It was your idea.

622
01:28:23,731 --> 01:28:26,634
No! It was his idea!

623
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,142
He said he'll kill
the mother and son!

624
01:28:30,038 --> 01:28:31,300
Honest!

625
01:29:04,439 --> 01:29:07,704
I'm sorry. Please forgive me.

626
01:29:09,644 --> 01:29:13,142
We were a happy family of three
till you infested us!

627
01:29:13,214 --> 01:29:14,476
You're a germ!

628
01:29:20,321 --> 01:29:23,290
You said I was cute, you cunt!

629
01:29:36,037 --> 01:29:38,198
Mommy, mommy…

630
01:29:39,140 --> 01:29:40,698
Look at me.

631
01:29:42,043 --> 01:29:44,068
You can't die like this.

632
01:29:45,513 --> 01:29:46,480
Mom.

633
01:29:50,218 --> 01:29:53,085
Tell me you forgive me.

634
01:29:53,721 --> 01:29:54,779
Mom…

635
01:29:55,223 --> 01:29:56,588
Look at me.

636
01:29:56,924 --> 01:30:01,229
If you forgive me blink once.

637
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:03,993
Just one blink? Please?

638
01:30:07,235 --> 01:30:10,204
Just once? Please?

639
01:30:19,914 --> 01:30:20,881
Let's go!

640
01:30:21,215 --> 01:30:24,581
That devil will suck
all the blood out of you, too!

641
01:30:29,223 --> 01:30:30,190
Let go!

642
01:30:32,627 --> 01:30:33,491
Let go!

643
01:30:40,535 --> 01:30:43,095
Stay back you devil!

644
01:30:52,213 --> 01:30:53,863
I want to go to Kang-woo.

645
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:55,880
Kill me, please.

646
01:30:56,417 --> 01:30:57,782
You want to go?

647
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:02,685
Go to your husband?

648
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:09,992
Really?

649
01:35:52,913 --> 01:35:55,177
Happy birthday, Tae-ju.

650
01:36:00,921 --> 01:36:05,187
Completely white
just like daylight.

651
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:16,492
That's a good girl.

652
01:37:17,131 --> 01:37:23,437
From now on, we wear shoes
inside the house like in the States.

653
01:37:23,437 --> 01:37:25,405
Cuz I'm in charge, now.

654
01:37:26,941 --> 01:37:30,570
You have to
sleep during the day, too.

655
01:37:31,312 --> 01:37:32,677
And eat at night…

656
01:37:35,316 --> 01:37:36,504
Did you just move?

657
01:37:44,925 --> 01:37:47,189
Watch TV while I'm out.

658
01:37:51,131 --> 01:37:53,292
A scary movies gonna be on.

659
01:40:04,932 --> 01:40:06,695
I'm not ashamed at all!

660
01:40:08,135 --> 01:40:09,102
I told you!

661
01:40:09,737 --> 01:40:10,991
I'll get the blood!

662
01:40:11,438 --> 01:40:13,000
Stealing from the hospital?

663
01:40:13,040 --> 01:40:14,842
–There's more.
–What?

664
01:40:14,842 --> 01:40:17,071
I'm helping people
who want to commit suicide.

665
01:40:17,111 --> 01:40:20,574
I know many people like that
from listening to confessions.

666
01:40:20,614 --> 01:40:23,914
If I run out, I'll find more
through the Internet.

667
01:40:24,918 --> 01:40:30,788
They face death more peacefully
if I help them.

668
01:40:35,629 --> 01:40:38,665
If they just give it to you,
what fun is that?

669
01:40:47,441 --> 01:40:49,487
It tastes much better this way.

670
01:40:50,010 --> 01:40:52,320
How many has to die
for your taste?

671
01:40:52,913 --> 01:40:58,374
Maybe around 500?
How's that, Father?

672
01:40:59,019 --> 01:41:01,395
I told you
I'm not a Father anymore!

673
01:41:01,522 --> 01:41:05,185
Oh dear, the Father is mad.

674
01:41:06,326 --> 01:41:09,989
Stop acting so humane!
You're not even human.

675
01:41:12,032 --> 01:41:13,233
Then what are we?

676
01:41:13,233 --> 01:41:15,741
We're human-eating beasts
that's what!

677
01:41:22,743 --> 01:41:25,317
Is it a sin for a fox
to eat a chicken?

678
01:41:50,437 --> 01:41:52,598
Don't make me regret
saving you.

679
01:41:54,041 --> 01:41:58,671
Kill me or save me
you'll regret either way.

680
01:41:59,213 --> 01:42:00,680
We're through!

681
01:42:12,126 --> 01:42:17,792
I dump him
and he drops me like this?

682
01:42:27,241 --> 01:42:29,607
You're the only one
I've got, now.

683
01:43:42,216 --> 01:43:45,777
You said women are
safe from EV.

684
01:43:46,520 --> 01:43:50,980
Your blood is completely
mixed with mine.

685
01:43:53,927 --> 01:43:55,986
Then, I'm no longer
a woman?

686
01:44:07,241 --> 01:44:08,401
Hold on.

687
01:44:13,213 --> 01:44:14,475
I'll get a doctor.

688
01:44:52,019 --> 01:44:53,179
Hello?

689
01:44:56,423 --> 01:44:57,788
How do you feel…

690
01:45:26,820 --> 01:45:27,684
Tae-ju…

691
01:45:29,923 --> 01:45:31,584
What day is it today?

692
01:45:40,934 --> 01:45:43,937
The eyes are so telling.

693
01:45:43,937 --> 01:45:48,542
They can express everything
between yes and no.

694
01:45:48,542 --> 01:45:51,670
What good is just a yes or no?

695
01:45:52,612 --> 01:45:55,877
You need a subject and verb
to communicate.

696
01:45:58,418 --> 01:46:02,582
The subject is
what's being stared at.

697
01:46:03,323 --> 01:46:06,293
If you stare at something
for over 4 seconds…

698
01:46:06,526 --> 01:46:10,292
others will automatically
turn to look, too.

699
01:46:11,131 --> 01:46:12,913
Is that a published theory?

700
01:46:14,935 --> 01:46:16,717
Haven't had the chance yet.

701
01:46:18,438 --> 01:46:22,332
I'm an expert at reading the eyes
after 2 years of marriage

702
01:46:23,510 --> 01:46:25,072
That's why her Korean's
not improving.

703
01:46:25,112 --> 01:46:27,979
Can you tell
what mom's saying?

704
01:46:28,315 --> 01:46:30,077
That's what I'm talking about!

705
01:46:30,117 --> 01:46:33,780
Tae-ju just saw me
peek over at Mrs Ra.

706
01:46:34,521 --> 01:46:38,685
She knew what I was going to say,
before I said it.

707
01:46:39,226 --> 01:46:40,887
By glancing at my eyes.

708
01:46:43,330 --> 01:46:48,835
Mrs Ra said I'd win
if I took this piece.

709
01:46:48,835 --> 01:46:51,838
And that she wants
some Vodka.

710
01:46:51,838 --> 01:46:52,896
Vodka!

711
01:46:55,542 --> 01:46:57,066
I win!

712
01:46:57,411 --> 01:46:59,473
Closed, Self-draw,
bonus 3 points,

713
01:46:59,513 --> 01:47:00,701
Big three dragons!

714
01:47:02,015 --> 01:47:03,983
See that?

715
01:47:05,318 --> 01:47:08,185
Thank you, Mrs Ra.

716
01:47:10,724 --> 01:47:12,692
You want to play that bad?

717
01:47:14,728 --> 01:47:18,186
How about teaming her up
with Evelyn?

718
01:47:19,232 --> 01:47:23,498
If you blink it means “yes”.

719
01:47:24,137 --> 01:47:27,197
A long blink means “no”.

720
01:47:27,841 --> 01:47:29,142
Okay?

721
01:47:29,142 --> 01:47:32,270
Blink if you understand.

722
01:47:43,723 --> 01:47:44,985
Throw it away.

723
01:47:45,625 --> 01:47:47,286
Mrs Ra is back!

724
01:47:47,828 --> 01:47:50,296
Evelyn? Vodka.

725
01:48:07,614 --> 01:48:08,672
“D”.

726
01:48:09,316 --> 01:48:12,683
“D”, what?

727
01:48:13,420 --> 01:48:15,400
You can move
your finger, mom?

728
01:48:16,423 --> 01:48:18,271
What's wrong with your nail?

729
01:48:18,925 --> 01:48:24,886
“L”. It's another letter!

730
01:48:25,632 --> 01:48:26,496
What?

731
01:48:26,733 --> 01:48:30,294
“L, D”.

732
01:48:31,037 --> 01:48:32,339
Or “D, L”?

733
01:48:32,339 --> 01:48:35,141
“D” comes last, “LD”.

734
01:48:35,141 --> 01:48:37,055
Maybe she wants the “LCD” on?

735
01:48:37,310 --> 01:48:39,713
There's probably
a “C” somewhere.

736
01:48:39,713 --> 01:48:42,181
“C”…

737
01:48:59,132 --> 01:49:00,099
Found it!

738
01:49:06,039 --> 01:49:08,007
–“K”!
–“K”?

739
01:49:09,543 --> 01:49:10,976
LDK?

740
01:49:19,619 --> 01:49:23,385
Ladies Delaying,
Killing the game.

741
01:49:24,925 --> 01:49:27,627
“D” comes last! “KLD”!

742
01:49:27,627 --> 01:49:29,686
Mrs Ra, it's “DKL”, right?

743
01:49:33,433 --> 01:49:35,435
She says, no.

744
01:49:35,435 --> 01:49:39,496
“KLD”? “KILLED”?

745
01:49:41,141 --> 01:49:42,199
I'm right?

746
01:49:44,210 --> 01:49:47,373
See? It's “KILLED”!

747
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,792
Whatever, let's keep
the game alive.

748
01:49:52,719 --> 01:49:57,486
–Whose turn is it?
–Killed who?

749
01:50:13,039 --> 01:50:15,745
Mahjong brings back
memories of Kang-woo?

750
01:50:16,910 --> 01:50:19,970
Mom… it's not your fault.

751
01:50:20,413 --> 01:50:22,381
He didn't die cuz of you.

752
01:50:22,816 --> 01:50:24,977
Stop playing and go to bed.

753
01:50:27,621 --> 01:50:29,282
Tae-ju's so strong.

754
01:50:37,731 --> 01:50:40,834
Stop torturing yourself

755
01:50:40,834 --> 01:50:42,699
Look at me, Mrs Ra.

756
01:50:43,136 --> 01:50:45,438
It was an accident.

757
01:50:45,438 --> 01:50:47,497
No one killed Kang-woo.

758
01:51:19,939 --> 01:51:23,375
It's not like Tae-ju
and Sang-hyun killed…

759
01:52:45,925 --> 01:52:48,086
Selfish humans.

760
01:52:50,029 --> 01:52:55,490
Bastards coming to play Mahjong
with a grieving family

761
01:53:01,141 --> 01:53:02,108
What?

762
01:53:03,710 --> 01:53:06,178
Why you little shit.

763
01:53:09,415 --> 01:53:14,978
I'm leaving,
cuz shit smells not scares.

764
01:53:38,711 --> 01:53:41,680
Honey! No!

765
01:53:54,527 --> 01:53:56,085
Oh, Young-du.

766
01:53:56,930 --> 01:53:58,295
Young-du!

767
01:54:24,123 --> 01:54:25,090
Stop it.

768
01:55:12,138 --> 01:55:15,505
You easy-blood drinking coward.

769
01:55:57,317 --> 01:56:00,878
It's cuz he's dead
and the heart stopped pumping.

770
01:56:03,923 --> 01:56:05,982
Cut off the ankles and…

771
01:56:06,626 --> 01:56:12,997
hang them over the bathtub
and let gravity do the rest.

772
01:56:14,634 --> 01:56:19,056
<i>We can put the blood in Tupperware
and keep it in the fridge</i>

773
01:56:20,139 --> 01:56:24,576
I thought of using a motor pump
but this works best.

774
01:56:25,712 --> 01:56:28,748
Sucking a little
and throwing the body away is

775
01:56:31,217 --> 01:56:33,593
treating life too lightly, isn't it?

776
01:56:52,338 --> 01:56:53,396
Evelyn…

777
01:56:56,542 --> 01:57:02,174
How could I have made
all those Kimbaps without you?

778
01:57:03,316 --> 01:57:04,977
It's over now.

779
01:57:06,819 --> 01:57:08,081
Happy?

780
01:57:21,634 --> 01:57:23,036
Tae-ju.

781
01:57:23,036 --> 01:57:25,300
Listen to me carefully.

782
01:57:28,641 --> 01:57:30,357
Why do I have to run away?

783
01:57:34,614 --> 01:57:35,802
From my own house?

784
01:57:35,915 --> 01:57:40,073
Wont they search the house
when they find the 4 people missing?

785
01:57:47,727 --> 01:57:52,687
They'll come in here
without dusting off their shoes?

786
01:57:52,832 --> 01:57:58,237
Search the house, open the cabinet
and open the curtains…

787
01:57:58,237 --> 01:58:00,797
Then well die?

788
01:58:05,011 --> 01:58:06,672
What are you doing?

789
01:58:12,118 --> 01:58:14,279
You already had your fill.

790
01:58:50,623 --> 01:58:51,988
Where are we going?

791
01:59:02,535 --> 01:59:03,900
Where are you going?

792
01:59:05,338 --> 01:59:06,703
The sun's coming up!

793
02:00:41,934 --> 02:00:44,442
Didn't you have your fill
from Evelyn?

794
02:07:23,736 --> 02:07:27,103
I wanted to live
with you forever and ever.

795
02:07:30,909 --> 02:07:32,757
Together again in hell then.

796
02:07:36,615 --> 02:07:39,880
When you're dead, you're dead.

797
02:07:42,521 --> 02:07:45,979
It's been fun, Father
