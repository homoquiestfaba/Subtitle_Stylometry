1
00:02:00,667 --> 00:02:01,751
- Where you been?

2
00:02:02,168 --> 00:02:03,878
- hospital, helping carmela.

3
00:02:04,274 --> 00:02:06,089
-the devotion that kid shows.

4
00:02:06,464 --> 00:02:08,883
I just think of
My marie, the kids,

5
00:02:09,092 --> 00:02:11,386
In that situation,
God forbid.

6
00:02:11,886 --> 00:02:12,887
My ma--

7
00:02:13,179 --> 00:02:15,390
- who the fuck would take care of her
Something happens?

8
00:02:15,556 --> 00:02:17,392
Except sil and you guys.

9
00:02:23,271 --> 00:02:24,855
Colombians knock off
At noon.

10
00:02:25,278 --> 00:02:26,567
<i>then it's empty.</i>

11
00:02:29,270 --> 00:02:30,872
Managers unit's down a flight.

12
00:02:42,290 --> 00:02:44,083
¡cuidado! ¡que alguien viene!

13
00:02:48,883 --> 00:02:50,597
- who's in there?
- open it.

14
00:02:56,264 --> 00:02:58,182
¡no dispares, soy yo!

15
00:03:02,478 --> 00:03:03,855
What the fuck?

16
00:03:04,856 --> 00:03:05,857
Get back!

17
00:03:09,152 --> 00:03:11,070
- shoot the prick.
- get the fuck out
Of the way.

18
00:03:18,369 --> 00:03:20,872
Cocksucking miserable
Spic shit!

19
00:03:21,164 --> 00:03:22,874
It's supposed to be
Empty here daytimes.

20
00:03:22,957 --> 00:03:24,751
- jesus, my fucking balls!

21
00:03:29,756 --> 00:03:30,757
The money!

22
00:03:32,675 --> 00:03:34,469
Fuck, my fucking balls.

23
00:03:34,886 --> 00:03:36,763
- oogatz here.
- the freeze.

24
00:03:40,183 --> 00:03:41,059
Nothing.

25
00:03:41,559 --> 00:03:43,686
Come on, let's blow.
Lot of fucking noise
We made.

26
00:03:43,978 --> 00:03:45,063
Fuck that.

27
00:03:47,565 --> 00:03:49,275
- close the goddamn door.

28
00:04:05,291 --> 00:04:07,252
This fucking shit
For a lousy two g's?

29
00:04:15,885 --> 00:04:16,970
Oh, anthony.

30
00:04:18,471 --> 00:04:20,265
- hi, uncle bobby.
- hiya, sweetheart.

31
00:04:22,267 --> 00:04:23,268
Cugin'.

32
00:04:24,060 --> 00:04:25,186
I'm gonna go ahead.

33
00:04:28,481 --> 00:04:29,565
What's up?

34
00:04:29,691 --> 00:04:31,776
You were at south mountain
Arena yesterday

35
00:04:31,985 --> 00:04:34,362
Trying to buy a gun
From that asshole
In the snack shop.

36
00:04:34,570 --> 00:04:35,572
- who told you that?

37
00:04:35,780 --> 00:04:37,991
- we know how you feel,
But you can't do this.

38
00:04:38,157 --> 00:04:40,285
I can't believe you
Know this.  Who told
You this?

39
00:04:40,451 --> 00:04:42,954
Look, if my pops was
Laying in there shot up

40
00:04:43,079 --> 00:04:45,290
- i'd be thinking
The same thing.
- but you can't go there.

41
00:04:45,582 --> 00:04:46,583
Yeah, why the fuck not?

42
00:04:46,791 --> 00:04:48,459
<i>listen to me,
I'm your uncle.</i>

43
00:04:48,668 --> 00:04:51,879
Junior's in federal lock-up.
No one's getting to him there.

44
00:04:52,255 --> 00:04:54,090
Well, it's difficult,
But not impossible.

45
00:04:54,257 --> 00:04:56,759
Trust me.
Your dad does not want
You to get involved.

46
00:04:57,260 --> 00:05:00,680
You gotta channel
That rage elsewheres.
Golden gloves.

47
00:05:01,055 --> 00:05:03,391
- what?
- dumbbells or something.

48
00:05:03,683 --> 00:05:04,976
Fuck your girlfriend more.

49
00:05:06,686 --> 00:05:08,479
You little hothead here.

50
00:05:29,083 --> 00:05:31,169
Did you park in emergency
Or in the garage?

51
00:05:31,252 --> 00:05:32,754
What's going on
In there?

52
00:05:33,463 --> 00:05:36,466
They're on rounds
Or something, dr. Plepler
And the indian girl.

53
00:05:40,261 --> 00:05:41,679
Hi, did you bring me
My sweater?

54
00:05:42,472 --> 00:05:43,473
Your sweater?

55
00:05:43,765 --> 00:05:45,683
Man, jesus, fuck!

56
00:05:46,476 --> 00:05:48,686
All right, take it easy.
What is your problem?

57
00:05:48,853 --> 00:05:51,189
My problem is i'm
Old enough to sit
With dad all night,

58
00:05:51,272 --> 00:05:53,066
Be a messenger boy,
Bring shit from
The house,

59
00:05:53,191 --> 00:05:54,651
- but i'm too young to deal
With the larger issues?

60
00:05:54,984 --> 00:05:55,985
- what are you talking about?

61
00:05:56,569 --> 00:05:57,987
Like you didn't
Put them up to it.

62
00:05:58,279 --> 00:06:00,281
Put who up to what?

63
00:06:02,575 --> 00:06:04,953
God, he was in such
A good mood this morning.

64
00:06:10,583 --> 00:06:13,586
I told the nurse  that i thought he
Moved his eyebrows  at around 5:30.

65
00:06:13,753 --> 00:06:16,756
Did she pass that along?
'Cause if not, i'm gonna
Be furious.

66
00:06:17,465 --> 00:06:19,759
Mrs. Soprano, you're really
Gonna have to recalibrate

67
00:06:19,968 --> 00:06:21,678
Your expectations
At this point.

68
00:06:22,262 --> 00:06:25,682
We can't even maintain
His blood pressure
At a level that we'd like.

69
00:06:25,890 --> 00:06:29,185
Until his fever dissipates
And his white cell
Count comes down,

70
00:06:29,477 --> 00:06:30,979
We're a long way
From home.

71
00:06:31,562 --> 00:06:33,189
But he's really
Fighting.

72
00:06:40,363 --> 00:06:41,990
Mom, he's really strong.

73
00:06:43,157 --> 00:06:44,158
That is true.

74
00:06:50,957 --> 00:06:52,083
Hi, dad.

75
00:07:26,159 --> 00:07:27,452
<i>monastery?</i>

76
00:08:01,778 --> 00:08:04,280
I received these
This morning.

77
00:08:06,866 --> 00:08:09,160
Do i really look
That much like this guy?

78
00:08:09,369 --> 00:08:12,580
To a certain extent,
All caucasians look alike.

79
00:08:12,956 --> 00:08:15,291
Look,
I'm not finnerty.

80
00:08:15,959 --> 00:08:18,169
I didn't sell you
This heating equipment.

81
00:08:18,753 --> 00:08:21,381
But i am kind of
Worried about what
I might have done.

82
00:08:23,883 --> 00:08:26,261
Because you see,
Yesterday--

83
00:08:26,469 --> 00:08:28,972
Yes, tell us,
There's no fraud
Without a fairy tale.

84
00:08:29,389 --> 00:08:31,474
Yesterday, i was diagnosed
With alzheimer's.

85
00:08:33,268 --> 00:08:34,269
- oh, my.

86
00:08:34,477 --> 00:08:36,562
And i'm in this
Strange city and--

87
00:08:37,063 --> 00:08:39,065
Please come inside.

88
00:08:43,861 --> 00:08:45,071
I came here because
I thought

89
00:08:45,280 --> 00:08:48,157
You could help
Me reach finnerty.

90
00:08:48,783 --> 00:08:52,662
I have his wallet.
I have his briefcase,
But i'm not him.

91
00:08:55,582 --> 00:08:57,959
Excuse the brothers
For laughing.

92
00:08:58,376 --> 00:09:00,169
One day we will
All die,

93
00:09:00,461 --> 00:09:02,755
And then we'll be
The same as that tree.

94
00:09:03,172 --> 00:09:04,382
No me, no you.

95
00:09:05,883 --> 00:09:08,261
Be that as it may,
We need heat.

96
00:09:08,553 --> 00:09:11,180
We need to find someone who will
Take responsibility.

97
00:09:12,056 --> 00:09:13,182
Well, i can't do that.

98
00:09:13,474 --> 00:09:15,059
Then the lawsuit
Proceeds.

99
00:09:29,991 --> 00:09:31,159
Hey, go home
And i'll stay.

100
00:09:31,367 --> 00:09:32,952
I just had chinese food.

101
00:09:38,958 --> 00:09:40,168
-  carmela?

102
00:09:41,085 --> 00:09:42,754
-  dr. Melfi, hi.
How are you?

103
00:09:43,379 --> 00:09:45,173
How  are you is
More the point.

104
00:09:45,391 --> 00:09:47,884
I'm running around crazy.
My son was supposed
To get coffee,

105
00:09:48,176 --> 00:09:51,054
Or tell the maid to.
It's the one thing
I have to have.

106
00:09:52,764 --> 00:09:54,682
I got your note.
It was so thoughtful.

107
00:09:54,974 --> 00:09:56,684
I've been calling
The hospital

108
00:09:56,768 --> 00:09:59,062
-  and they say that
Anthony's stabilized.

109
00:09:59,270 --> 00:10:00,480
- that's what they say.

110
00:10:00,563 --> 00:10:02,982
If you or anyone
Needs anything,

111
00:10:03,066 --> 00:10:05,860
To talk or to run
Interference with
The doctors,

112
00:10:06,152 --> 00:10:07,278
<i>- don't hesitate to call.</i>

113
00:10:07,362 --> 00:10:08,988
- i appreciate that.
Thank you.

114
00:10:09,072 --> 00:10:11,491
I have plenty of people
Around i can talk to.

115
00:10:12,158 --> 00:10:13,284
Of course.

116
00:10:14,077 --> 00:10:15,161
Good luck.

117
00:10:22,585 --> 00:10:24,170
- morning, gab. Is he ready?

118
00:10:24,379 --> 00:10:25,463
- he's eating.

119
00:10:25,755 --> 00:10:27,590
We're picking up
Mrs. S. At 10:00.

120
00:10:27,757 --> 00:10:30,677
I saw her tuesday.
How's she holding up,
Poor thing?

121
00:10:30,760 --> 00:10:32,553
Not so hotso, really.

122
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:34,555
- coffee?
- yeah, thanks.

123
00:10:38,559 --> 00:10:40,979
You hear about the thing
In the old neighborhood?

124
00:10:41,271 --> 00:10:43,064
I'm not busy enough
For all this?

125
00:10:43,189 --> 00:10:46,651
Couple of guys left three
On the floor in some
Colombian laundry.

126
00:10:54,075 --> 00:10:55,368
Two guys we know,
Huh?

127
00:10:55,577 --> 00:10:56,661
Total bloodbath.

128
00:10:56,869 --> 00:10:58,871
Somebody said
A million plus.

129
00:10:59,080 --> 00:11:00,290
What a score.

130
00:11:00,665 --> 00:11:01,583
Fuckin' a.

131
00:11:02,166 --> 00:11:03,960
<i>sil, benny
 says you have to go.</i>

132
00:11:04,168 --> 00:11:05,253
- yeah, all right.

133
00:11:06,087 --> 00:11:07,463
Listen, don't forget...

134
00:11:08,673 --> 00:11:10,758
Oh, honey,
Your asthma kicking up?

135
00:11:11,968 --> 00:11:14,679
Springtime. Pollen's out of control.

136
00:11:16,264 --> 00:11:17,890
- i am so proud of you.

137
00:11:18,474 --> 00:11:21,561
- acting boss.
I hoped the day
Would never come.

138
00:11:21,978 --> 00:11:23,563
You've always
Sold yourself short.

139
00:11:23,980 --> 00:11:26,357
You know, that's
Not what i mean.
You know me.

140
00:11:27,567 --> 00:11:29,986
All i ever wanted
Was to carve out
A little piece,

141
00:11:30,271 --> 00:11:31,655
Enjoy some grandkids.

142
00:11:31,868 --> 00:11:34,487
But how many guys
Could step into
Tony's shoes

143
00:11:34,573 --> 00:11:36,790
- and do the job
You're doing?
- you think?

144
00:11:36,950 --> 00:11:38,782
You have such strength
In crisis.

145
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:41,083
Benny told me
He feels honored
To drive you.

146
00:11:41,453 --> 00:11:44,877
You're firm about
What you want without
Being obnoxious about it.

147
00:11:45,168 --> 00:11:48,463
Sil, have you asked
Yourself what happens

148
00:11:48,671 --> 00:11:51,674
If, god forbid,
Tony soprano doesn't
Recover?

149
00:11:57,055 --> 00:12:00,266
Listen, gab,
I never talk to you
About my work.

150
00:12:00,475 --> 00:12:01,476
And?

151
00:12:02,185 --> 00:12:04,270
I'm gonna tell you something
I never told anybody.

152
00:12:05,688 --> 00:12:07,190
Back when jackie
Was at the end,

153
00:12:07,357 --> 00:12:10,068
He floated the idea
Of me stepping up
To the big seat.

154
00:12:10,985 --> 00:12:12,570
Not tony, me.

155
00:12:13,071 --> 00:12:14,072
- really?

156
00:12:14,656 --> 00:12:16,658
- yeah, but i thought...
It's not for me.

157
00:12:16,866 --> 00:12:18,576
- still, you wouldn't
Sneeze at it.

158
00:12:19,160 --> 00:12:21,371
I never saw myself
As that kind of guy.

159
00:12:21,579 --> 00:12:23,373
I'm more behind
The scenes--

160
00:12:23,456 --> 00:12:24,582
Advice,

161
00:12:25,458 --> 00:12:26,751
Strategy.

162
00:12:28,461 --> 00:12:30,088
But here you are, sil.

163
00:12:30,755 --> 00:12:32,966
The times make
The man, honey,

164
00:12:33,174 --> 00:12:34,968
Not the other way
Around.

165
00:12:36,552 --> 00:12:39,389
- asians flip for horror films.
Plus, there's ancillary--

166
00:12:41,057 --> 00:12:42,392
No change with tony.

167
00:12:42,767 --> 00:12:44,560
Carmela's in
Goddamn pieces.

168
00:12:45,561 --> 00:12:48,189
Memo-- get some coffee
Up to carmela's house.

169
00:12:50,858 --> 00:12:53,987
Sil, bobby was making
Collections up in roseville
Again last night.

170
00:12:54,279 --> 00:12:56,864
My time is limited.
Get him over and let's
Resolve this.

171
00:13:06,457 --> 00:13:08,459
- how's the skip doing?
- same.

172
00:13:08,585 --> 00:13:10,253
You forget something,
Like my cut?

173
00:13:10,587 --> 00:13:13,256
You believe this guy?
You should've lost some
Weight in that nose,

174
00:13:13,683 --> 00:13:16,884
Keep it out
Of everybody's business.
I'm working on it.

175
00:13:19,262 --> 00:13:20,680
It's these fucking
Flowers right here.

176
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:23,266
Get this shit out
Of here.

177
00:13:30,189 --> 00:13:32,483
That was junior's
Neighborhood, so now
It's mine.

178
00:13:32,567 --> 00:13:34,152
Keep your voice down here.

179
00:13:34,360 --> 00:13:35,361
<i>  a va'napola--.</i>

180
00:13:35,486 --> 00:13:38,072
- it was eugene's  going on three
Years. And eugene was with me.

181
00:13:38,281 --> 00:13:41,576
- you should have never had it to begin
With, except for the beef with
The tasty freeze route.

182
00:13:41,784 --> 00:13:44,078
Junior ruled on it,
And it wasn't right then.

183
00:13:44,287 --> 00:13:45,872
This fucking guy.

184
00:13:46,372 --> 00:13:47,582
Easy.

185
00:13:48,082 --> 00:13:50,460
- how much
We talking about?
- three g's a week.

186
00:13:51,085 --> 00:13:53,755
Maybe that's what that miserab'
Admitted to you. I heard five.

187
00:13:54,088 --> 00:13:54,964
- you heard wrong.

188
00:13:56,257 --> 00:13:57,675
What do we
Do here, sil?

189
00:14:00,970 --> 00:14:01,971
- here's the thing.

190
00:14:02,180 --> 00:14:03,181
- What, skip?

191
00:14:04,265 --> 00:14:06,351
For the time being,
It's bobby's.

192
00:14:07,977 --> 00:14:11,564
But he's still gonna
Kick up to you 20%.

193
00:14:11,981 --> 00:14:13,983
- how long's
For the time being?
- yeah, sil.

194
00:14:15,360 --> 00:14:17,070
What, do you
Speak norwegian?

195
00:14:17,278 --> 00:14:20,365
For now.  We'll see
How much is there.

196
00:14:25,578 --> 00:14:27,872
Hi, everyone.
My god, you poor thing.

197
00:14:28,581 --> 00:14:31,167
Hey,  we just need
Some irish spring.

198
00:14:38,258 --> 00:14:39,175
Good morning.

199
00:14:52,981 --> 00:14:54,065
Another one?

200
00:15:00,488 --> 00:15:03,074
- know what i
Found out yesterday?
- what's that?

201
00:15:09,789 --> 00:15:11,874
I was diagnosed
Actually...

202
00:15:14,252 --> 00:15:15,461
With alzheimer's.

203
00:15:17,088 --> 00:15:18,756
Man,  i'm sorry
To hear that.

204
00:15:21,551 --> 00:15:23,678
My uncle has
Memory loss.

205
00:15:24,387 --> 00:15:25,555
Maybe it's hereditary.

206
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:27,765
Someone's probably
Studying that.

207
00:15:33,688 --> 00:15:35,064
Is it possible

208
00:15:36,274 --> 00:15:37,984
That i am kevin finnerty?

209
00:15:40,153 --> 00:15:41,279
All right, i'll stop.

210
00:16:42,757 --> 00:16:43,883
- sil.

211
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:45,885
- what?

212
00:16:46,261 --> 00:16:48,471
You heard about this
Oran street takedown?

213
00:16:48,888 --> 00:16:50,181
<i>the colombians?
That you?</i>

214
00:16:50,556 --> 00:16:52,183
My guy had the tip.

215
00:16:52,475 --> 00:16:54,852
Should be a nice
Chunk for everybody.

216
00:16:55,186 --> 00:16:56,271
<i>everybody?</i>

217
00:16:56,479 --> 00:16:59,482
Carmela,
She gets t's cut under
The circumstances, correct?

218
00:16:59,857 --> 00:17:00,984
<i>it's your call.</i>

219
00:17:02,068 --> 00:17:04,153
I know it's
My fucking call.

220
00:17:07,782 --> 00:17:09,576
Yes, that is
The correct thing.

221
00:17:11,369 --> 00:17:13,663
Oh, ladies' room's
Next door.

222
00:17:13,871 --> 00:17:15,456
I can reach it
From here.

223
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:18,376
Grim fucking scene,
That i.c.u.

224
00:17:18,585 --> 00:17:20,378
<i>she's one brave lady.</i>

225
00:17:20,878 --> 00:17:24,674
I was just saying,
I'm gonna get t's piece
Of my half to sil for her.

226
00:17:24,966 --> 00:17:25,967
- of the thing.

227
00:17:26,185 --> 00:17:27,260
- back up there, bruto.

228
00:17:27,468 --> 00:17:29,679
Your half?  I did
All the heavy lifting.

229
00:17:29,971 --> 00:17:31,889
You would never have
Heard about it without
My information.

230
00:17:32,056 --> 00:17:33,975
Big help.
It was fucking mayhem.

231
00:17:34,058 --> 00:17:35,560
You said the place
Was empty.

232
00:17:35,685 --> 00:17:38,563
Doc says i need
An ultrasound on
My groin and balls.

233
00:17:38,771 --> 00:17:40,690
Sil, you wanna
Weigh in here?

234
00:17:45,778 --> 00:17:47,363
It breaks
Half and half.

235
00:17:47,572 --> 00:17:49,866
You both kick tony's
To me to deal with.

236
00:17:50,366 --> 00:17:53,453
I'll have it for you
Sil, the whole 80k.

237
00:17:54,787 --> 00:17:57,290
Ho, ho, ho, 80k?
How's that 20%
Of a million?

238
00:17:57,675 --> 00:18:00,376
Have a cookie,
You're delirious.
It was 750, tops.

239
00:18:00,668 --> 00:18:03,087
Fuck it all, paulie.
Tommy cased that shithole.

240
00:18:03,379 --> 00:18:06,174
<i>what's with the fucking
Accounting out there?</i>

241
00:18:06,466 --> 00:18:08,468
<i>that's a 100 grand apiece.
You got it?</i>

242
00:18:08,676 --> 00:18:10,470
<i>we're looking
After carmela.</i>

243
00:18:10,887 --> 00:18:12,764
- no question.
- of course.

244
00:18:13,264 --> 00:18:15,058
Sooner than later,
Paulie.

245
00:18:15,892 --> 00:18:18,269
I gotta piss first.
You want half
Of that, too?

246
00:18:25,151 --> 00:18:29,072
<i>j.t.:
In a prior incarnation,
I would get my load on,</i>

247
00:18:29,489 --> 00:18:31,866
Blow 20 residuals
At the track.

248
00:18:32,367 --> 00:18:33,785
As writers,

249
00:18:35,286 --> 00:18:37,872
We are all hung up.

250
00:18:39,165 --> 00:18:41,459
But we are also
Hung up

251
00:18:41,876 --> 00:18:43,586
On our own hang-up.

252
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:47,090
We mythologize
Our inner narrative.

253
00:18:47,257 --> 00:18:50,051
Take for example,
"beowulf."

254
00:18:51,052 --> 00:18:52,262
Who is grendel,

255
00:18:52,470 --> 00:18:55,056
But the habit,
The disease.

256
00:18:56,766 --> 00:18:59,269
Ah, fresh casualties
In the battle
Of the blank page.

257
00:18:59,560 --> 00:19:02,063
Welcome to the writer's guild.
Have a seat.

258
00:19:03,690 --> 00:19:05,191
Take me...

259
00:19:06,776 --> 00:19:08,069
My past as an addict.

260
00:19:11,990 --> 00:19:13,074
Get the fuck up!
Come on!

261
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,290
Give me that
Fucking fisheye.

262
00:19:20,373 --> 00:19:23,084
I'm offering you
A way to wipe your
Fucking obligation.

263
00:19:23,167 --> 00:19:25,169
Wasn't  me who told you
To start gambling again.

264
00:19:25,378 --> 00:19:27,088
I can't write a feature now.

265
00:19:27,171 --> 00:19:28,965
I just landed a staff job.

266
00:19:29,173 --> 00:19:32,677
People are seeing
Huge profits with these
Digital horror movies.

267
00:19:32,885 --> 00:19:34,971
Douchebags who never
Made a film before.

268
00:19:35,054 --> 00:19:37,682
That  "saw" thing,
400 grand to make,

269
00:19:37,890 --> 00:19:40,059
Took in 100 mil
Worldwide.

270
00:19:41,853 --> 00:19:43,479
I'm 100% well.

271
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:46,190
I deliver this script,
I owe you nothing?

272
00:19:46,357 --> 00:19:48,484
You hear this dude?
100% well.

273
00:19:48,568 --> 00:19:50,987
He's a bad boy, huh,
With that lingo?

274
00:19:51,279 --> 00:19:53,072
Real fucking
Dark character.

275
00:19:55,867 --> 00:19:57,952
My idea is "saw" meets
"godfather 2."

276
00:19:59,162 --> 00:20:01,289
Proven track record--
Both genres.

277
00:20:01,456 --> 00:20:04,459
Young wiseguy, assassin,
Gets betrayed by his people.
They whack him.

278
00:20:04,584 --> 00:20:07,670
Leave his body parts
In dumpsters all

279
00:20:07,754 --> 00:20:10,089
Around the city.
Long story short,

280
00:20:10,256 --> 00:20:13,760
He is put back together by science,
Or maybe it's supernatural.

281
00:20:14,052 --> 00:20:17,180
And he gets fucking
Payback on everyone
Who fucked him over,

282
00:20:17,263 --> 00:20:19,265
Including the cunt
He was engaged to.

283
00:20:19,390 --> 00:20:22,685
She was getting porked
By his boss the night
The hero was killed.

284
00:20:23,561 --> 00:20:25,063
We'll have a meeting
Tomorrow.

285
00:20:25,480 --> 00:20:28,191
We hear what you've fleshed
Out before we go to script.

286
00:20:28,483 --> 00:20:31,861
Bing, 2:30.
Don't make me
Come look for you.

287
00:20:49,462 --> 00:20:50,755
An entire room

288
00:20:51,756 --> 00:20:53,466
Full of writers,

289
00:20:53,591 --> 00:20:55,677
And you did nothing!

290
00:21:01,975 --> 00:21:03,977
Sir, it's family only
In the unit.

291
00:21:04,185 --> 00:21:05,770
I'll be out of your hair
In a minute, sister.

292
00:21:05,853 --> 00:21:08,982
I keep telling you people,
I'm gonna have to call
The hospital administrator.

293
00:21:17,782 --> 00:21:20,868
I wanted to let you know
There's a major package
Coming your way

294
00:21:21,077 --> 00:21:23,788
From paulie and vito,
Very significant.

295
00:21:23,955 --> 00:21:26,165
You all have done
So much already.

296
00:21:26,666 --> 00:21:29,252
We just found out
Insurance won't pay
For physical therapy.

297
00:21:29,586 --> 00:21:31,963
Bastards.
So thank you.

298
00:21:33,381 --> 00:21:34,882
You wanna come in,
Say hello?

299
00:21:37,677 --> 00:21:38,678
Uh, sure.

300
00:21:58,364 --> 00:21:59,490
- hello, father.

301
00:21:59,782 --> 00:22:00,783
- silvio.

302
00:22:18,509 --> 00:22:22,096
I have napoleons,
But i also got fruit
For a certain party.

303
00:22:22,305 --> 00:22:23,389
Either's good.

304
00:22:23,598 --> 00:22:26,392
The program says
Sugar after meals
- tells the body you're full.

305
00:22:26,601 --> 00:22:27,810
- when you married my cousin,

306
00:22:27,894 --> 00:22:30,313
Everybody used to say you
Looked like john travolta.

307
00:22:31,314 --> 00:22:33,608
He's almost back
To his white suit.

308
00:22:41,824 --> 00:22:44,494
The bacala question.
Bobby don't have
Any claim.

309
00:22:44,702 --> 00:22:47,997
I don't know why sil ruled so
Half-assed on you.
It's not my style.

310
00:22:48,122 --> 00:22:51,209
- he's worried more about taking
Care of carmela than the actual
Fucking earners.

311
00:22:51,501 --> 00:22:53,419
- please.
With johnny awaiting trial

312
00:22:53,503 --> 00:22:55,588
And the feds
Freezing his assets,

313
00:22:55,922 --> 00:22:58,007
Who do you think's
Keeping ginny in
Butter brickle?

314
00:22:58,299 --> 00:23:01,594
Lucky for me,
Those last years
I was in the can,

315
00:23:01,886 --> 00:23:05,306
My kid brother billy
Took care of patty
And the grandkids.

316
00:23:08,309 --> 00:23:11,396
Only to have that
Motherfucking animal
Blundetto--

317
00:23:11,688 --> 00:23:13,022
Don't do it
To yourself, philly.

318
00:23:15,692 --> 00:23:17,110
It's hard to forget.

319
00:23:18,987 --> 00:23:20,405
I don't forget.

320
00:23:29,414 --> 00:23:30,915
I forget what
We were talking about.

321
00:23:31,624 --> 00:23:32,917
Me too.
What the fuck was it?

322
00:23:34,919 --> 00:23:37,088
Carmela.
The thing is--

323
00:23:38,089 --> 00:23:39,507
You want coffee, coz?

324
00:23:39,716 --> 00:23:41,301
If you're already
Making it.

325
00:23:41,718 --> 00:23:43,803
Hot water
And lemon, hon.

326
00:23:46,306 --> 00:23:47,515
H onestly...

327
00:23:49,017 --> 00:23:50,893
How can i short carmela?

328
00:23:52,895 --> 00:23:54,314
Maybe i'm not
Following you.

329
00:23:54,522 --> 00:23:57,525
I'm as supportive
As the next guy,
But there's a point.

330
00:23:58,026 --> 00:23:59,986
And what if tony
Takes a turn
For the worse?

331
00:24:00,403 --> 00:24:02,697
I'm gonna hand her
$100,000,

332
00:24:03,114 --> 00:24:04,699
And he dies
The next day?

333
00:24:06,826 --> 00:24:08,119
Be money
Down the drain.

334
00:24:08,286 --> 00:24:10,705
It's tempting,
But you can't think
That way.

335
00:24:15,627 --> 00:24:16,794
<i>you all set now?</i>

336
00:24:17,712 --> 00:24:20,214
Yeah, i'm living
It up here.

337
00:24:20,590 --> 00:24:22,425
You  still stewing
About that money?

338
00:24:22,592 --> 00:24:24,302
Spend some,
You'll get over it.

339
00:24:24,510 --> 00:24:25,887
I'll never get over it.

340
00:24:27,513 --> 00:24:29,599
Certain people--
Let me tell you.

341
00:24:29,807 --> 00:24:31,517
Oh, come on,
Not sil again.

342
00:24:31,726 --> 00:24:34,020
Carmela.
He's a fucking vegetable.

343
00:24:34,187 --> 00:24:37,398
But i still gotta pay
Tribute to the princess
Of little italy.

344
00:24:37,899 --> 00:24:39,901
- the boss' wife.
What are you gonna do?

345
00:24:40,193 --> 00:24:41,611
- fuck her.

346
00:24:54,768 --> 00:24:55,978
I'm on my way in now.

347
00:24:56,770 --> 00:24:59,481
Yeah, good, and you might
Want to take care of that
Thing we talked about.

348
00:25:00,149 --> 00:25:00,983
- which thing?

349
00:25:01,150 --> 00:25:02,985
<i>- that big piece of pie you
 were bringing to the hospital.</i>

350
00:25:03,360 --> 00:25:04,945
- she's expecting you,
So make it happen.

351
00:25:05,279 --> 00:25:06,155
- what are you worried about?

352
00:25:06,655 --> 00:25:08,782
I think i know who
I'm fucking dealing
With here.

353
00:25:09,074 --> 00:25:10,075
- i resent that.

354
00:25:10,576 --> 00:25:11,952
- you have a problem
Taking orders from me?

355
00:25:12,453 --> 00:25:14,455
Keep your shirt on.
It's done.

356
00:25:24,048 --> 00:25:26,967
Don't get in bed
With him again.
You dislodged his drains.

357
00:25:28,552 --> 00:25:29,845
That was my daughter.

358
00:25:30,471 --> 00:25:33,182
And i can't help but think
That physical affection
Means something.

359
00:25:48,364 --> 00:25:50,574
They refrigerate
This place, huh?

360
00:25:59,875 --> 00:26:00,959
There you go.

361
00:26:15,557 --> 00:26:16,684
<i>what are you still
Doing out there?</i>

362
00:26:16,850 --> 00:26:18,477
I got involved
In a lawsuit.

363
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:19,478
<i>- a lawsuit?</i>

364
00:26:19,645 --> 00:26:21,146
- could create
Problems later.

365
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:22,648
<i>what kind of lawsuit?</i>

366
00:26:26,485 --> 00:26:27,569
- also...

367
00:26:27,945 --> 00:26:28,946
<i>- what?</i>

368
00:26:29,279 --> 00:26:31,782
I had an accident.
I fell down some stairs.

369
00:26:31,949 --> 00:26:33,075
<i>oh my god!</i>

370
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:35,077
The doctor said...

371
00:26:37,663 --> 00:26:38,872
<i>what d he say?</i>

372
00:26:40,582 --> 00:26:42,584
"mild concussion,"
He said.

373
00:26:43,085 --> 00:26:44,378
Told me i'd be okay.

374
00:26:44,670 --> 00:26:46,380
<i>that's it.
I'm coming out there.</i>

375
00:26:48,173 --> 00:26:50,968
<i>my mother's over here anyway.
She can stay with the kids.</i>

376
00:26:53,762 --> 00:26:55,055
No, don't do that.

377
00:26:56,765 --> 00:26:59,184
<i>are you telling
Me everything?</i>

378
00:27:12,448 --> 00:27:14,074
J.t., i want
To introduce you

379
00:27:14,158 --> 00:27:17,077
To carmine lupertazzi
My co-executive
Producer on the project.

380
00:27:17,161 --> 00:27:18,746
Nice to finally meet.

381
00:27:18,871 --> 00:27:21,665
I heard tidbits of what
Chris has got in mind--
The genre and so forth.

382
00:27:22,583 --> 00:27:23,751
But, j.t.,
I gotta warn you,

383
00:27:24,084 --> 00:27:26,670
I'm very hands-on.
I learned that
The hard way.

384
00:27:29,256 --> 00:27:30,382
I wanna welcome all
Of you to the first
Meeting

385
00:27:30,549 --> 00:27:33,469
Of possible investors
On this project.

386
00:27:34,178 --> 00:27:37,473
Some of you know
I've had nine pictures
Under my subspecies,

387
00:27:37,681 --> 00:27:40,184
Four in the "south beach
Strumpet" series alone,

388
00:27:40,476 --> 00:27:43,354
Each with 30,000-plus
Dvds in print.

389
00:27:44,063 --> 00:27:46,273
That being said,
I usually find it
Helpful at this stage

390
00:27:46,357 --> 00:27:49,568
To include my
Prospective partners
And get your inputs

391
00:27:50,069 --> 00:27:52,780
Or notes as we call them.

392
00:27:53,572 --> 00:27:55,366
J.t., you're on.

393
00:28:00,663 --> 00:28:03,457
We've been working on a new
Kind of slasher film.

394
00:28:03,957 --> 00:28:05,668
It takes place
In the world of...

395
00:28:06,085 --> 00:28:07,169
You know...

396
00:28:10,547 --> 00:28:11,548
Um, the mafia.

397
00:28:11,757 --> 00:28:13,759
It's about
A wiseguy with a big mouth

398
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,260
And bigger dreams.

399
00:28:18,180 --> 00:28:19,848
Anyway, they call him
"the butcher."

400
00:28:20,766 --> 00:28:22,559
- no, they don't.
- why the fuck not?

401
00:28:22,977 --> 00:28:26,146
Need i remind you
Of a certain butcher
Out of a.c.?

402
00:28:26,772 --> 00:28:27,856
Right.

403
00:28:28,065 --> 00:28:29,566
Not "butcher."
Go on, j.t.

404
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:32,069
So, right.

405
00:28:32,444 --> 00:28:35,072
He's kind of
Outshining his boss.

406
00:28:35,364 --> 00:28:38,450
So the guy has him clipped,
But he's still alive

407
00:28:38,784 --> 00:28:40,077
When they cut him up.

408
00:28:40,577 --> 00:28:42,246
He's gonna feel
That the next day.

409
00:28:44,456 --> 00:28:45,457
Right.

410
00:28:45,582 --> 00:28:46,750
So at the dump,

411
00:28:46,959 --> 00:28:49,086
His body
Reassembles itself,

412
00:28:49,253 --> 00:28:51,171
All except for
A hand that got crushed.

413
00:28:51,380 --> 00:28:53,465
So he ties a cleaver

414
00:28:53,674 --> 00:28:54,883
Onto the stump

415
00:28:55,050 --> 00:28:57,678
<i>and he goes out
To get revenge
On everyone,</i>

416
00:28:57,970 --> 00:29:01,348
Especially the boss, which
Is a pretty solid role.

417
00:29:01,765 --> 00:29:04,560
Right now it's called
"pork store killer."

418
00:29:04,768 --> 00:29:06,478
But i'm thinking...

419
00:29:06,854 --> 00:29:08,063
Just...

420
00:29:09,273 --> 00:29:10,357
"cleaver."

421
00:29:13,652 --> 00:29:15,946
I'm confused.
You said he's dead.

422
00:29:17,156 --> 00:29:19,783
How's he evening
Up with anybody?
He's a ghost?

423
00:29:20,868 --> 00:29:23,662
As i understood,
A zombie of sorts.

424
00:29:24,371 --> 00:29:25,748
Great title,
By the way.

425
00:29:26,373 --> 00:29:27,583
<i>but if they jointed him,</i>

426
00:29:27,875 --> 00:29:30,252
He's not gonna end up
All in the same dump.

427
00:29:30,878 --> 00:29:33,547
- and how's that
A slasher film?
- what are you talking about?

428
00:29:33,964 --> 00:29:36,759
A slasher.
A couple of kids
Naked in a lake.

429
00:29:37,051 --> 00:29:39,678
Certified maniac
On the loose,
Not a ghost.

430
00:29:40,262 --> 00:29:43,057
Actually, the maniac
Is almost always
A supernatural force.

431
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:45,351
Freddy, jason, michael myers
From "halloween."

432
00:29:45,559 --> 00:29:46,852
Get the fuck out.

433
00:29:47,186 --> 00:29:49,480
Easy, sil, easy.
He's making a point.

434
00:29:50,064 --> 00:29:52,858
Michael myers is
An escaped mental patient.

435
00:29:53,067 --> 00:29:55,361
Jason and freddy,
Different kind of movie.

436
00:29:55,569 --> 00:29:57,071
Well, that's the kind
We're doing here.

437
00:29:57,154 --> 00:29:59,156
"saw," "the ring"--
They made millions.

438
00:29:59,281 --> 00:30:02,368
And that's not even
Including "the godfather"
Angle, which we got here.

439
00:30:03,786 --> 00:30:04,870
<i>what if...</i>

440
00:30:07,956 --> 00:30:10,376
They disposed him
At stops

441
00:30:10,751 --> 00:30:13,462
That happened
To be along the same route?

442
00:30:14,672 --> 00:30:17,049
Then he would all end up
In the same dump.

443
00:30:18,884 --> 00:30:20,260
But he's a ghost?

444
00:30:21,261 --> 00:30:22,262
I don't know.

445
00:30:22,471 --> 00:30:24,848
"ghostbusters"--
Another fucking
Money machine.

446
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:30,980
Cavalry's here.
I brought some cannelloni.

447
00:30:31,355 --> 00:30:32,356
Again.

448
00:30:33,774 --> 00:30:36,986
It's got bechamel  on it,
So five, six hours out of the
Fridge, tops.

449
00:30:43,450 --> 00:30:44,451
Look at her.

450
00:30:44,785 --> 00:30:47,079
That word "plucky,"
Is that what it means?

451
00:30:47,663 --> 00:30:49,957
Only, when do i get
To spend some face time
With the skip?

452
00:30:50,249 --> 00:30:52,584
Hospital gets ticked off.
We'll try to sneak you.

453
00:30:52,751 --> 00:30:54,378
<i>man on tv:
...in this mob family
Domestic shooting,</i>

454
00:30:54,545 --> 00:30:57,256
Which some observers
Note carries the echoes

455
00:30:57,464 --> 00:30:59,883
<i>of the death of soul great
Marvin gaye.</i>

456
00:31:00,551 --> 00:31:03,262
<i>as 20-year-old anthony
Soprano jr. Himself</i>

457
00:31:03,554 --> 00:31:05,180
Told our amy kean,

458
00:31:05,681 --> 00:31:07,057
"growing up soprano,

459
00:31:07,558 --> 00:31:09,685
<i>it's just plain weird."</i>

460
00:31:14,273 --> 00:31:15,357
Carmela?

461
00:31:21,071 --> 00:31:23,574
- i swear to god,
I'm gonna fucking kill you!
- what the fuck?

462
00:31:23,866 --> 00:31:25,659
You made a fool of
Yourself and our family

463
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:27,870
On national
Fucking television?

464
00:31:28,078 --> 00:31:29,371
I didn't even say
That shit.

465
00:31:29,747 --> 00:31:32,166
They totally
Misquoted me.
- holy shit.

466
00:31:32,875 --> 00:31:34,960
Well, of course they did.
That's what they do.

467
00:31:36,170 --> 00:31:37,880
Which is why i
And everybody else

468
00:31:38,047 --> 00:31:40,466
Told you, "don't talk
To the press!"

469
00:31:40,758 --> 00:31:42,885
You're the one
Who looked like
A total asshole.

470
00:31:43,052 --> 00:31:44,970
Dragging me around like
I was five years old.

471
00:31:45,054 --> 00:31:47,056
You are a cross to bear.
That's all you are.

472
00:31:47,264 --> 00:31:49,266
To your father, to me,
To everybody.

473
00:31:49,767 --> 00:31:52,186
Fuck this.
Fuck it all!

474
00:31:55,064 --> 00:31:57,983
Jesus, mel, the hell's
Wrong with you?

475
00:31:58,776 --> 00:32:00,361
What's wrong with me?

476
00:32:00,486 --> 00:32:01,945
What's wrong with me?

477
00:32:02,154 --> 00:32:03,280
Mom.

478
00:32:07,951 --> 00:32:09,453
It had to happen.
She's fried.

479
00:32:27,763 --> 00:32:30,975
You have any extra compensation
For what you've been going through?

480
00:32:31,183 --> 00:32:32,977
Nah, part of the job.

481
00:32:33,686 --> 00:32:34,853
Like they say,

482
00:32:35,980 --> 00:32:38,357
With great power comes
Great responsibility.

483
00:32:40,985 --> 00:32:43,654
You know, vito called me
"skip" the other day.

484
00:32:43,862 --> 00:32:44,863
Really?

485
00:32:45,364 --> 00:32:46,865
Slip of the tongue no doubt,

486
00:32:47,282 --> 00:32:49,284
But i noticed
He didn't correct himself.

487
00:32:49,451 --> 00:32:50,577
See?

488
00:32:51,662 --> 00:32:54,957
If it did become
Permanent, your compensation
Might be...

489
00:32:55,582 --> 00:32:56,750
- don't go there.

490
00:33:02,881 --> 00:33:04,883
Hi, gab.
I need sil for a second.

491
00:33:04,967 --> 00:33:06,969
Can you keep it short?
He's pretty beat.

492
00:33:09,972 --> 00:33:11,974
This better be
Important, bobby.

493
00:33:12,182 --> 00:33:15,060
Got a new baby and two kids
In private school.

494
00:33:15,185 --> 00:33:17,062
This arrangement
With vito is killing me.

495
00:33:17,271 --> 00:33:18,772
It's 9:30 at night.

496
00:33:19,356 --> 00:33:21,859
Bobby, i don't remember
What the fuck it was.

497
00:33:22,276 --> 00:33:25,070
Roseville,
This temporary shit.
I need an answer already.

498
00:33:25,863 --> 00:33:27,281
I'm going out of my
Fucking mind here.

499
00:33:27,573 --> 00:33:29,074
I'm liable to do
Something drastic.

500
00:33:29,366 --> 00:33:31,952
Calm the fuck down.
Let me think.

501
00:33:37,374 --> 00:33:38,584
Mornings are better.

502
00:33:40,961 --> 00:33:42,546
I'll come up
With a solution.

503
00:33:43,672 --> 00:33:45,549
I don't want you
To worry about it.

504
00:33:51,180 --> 00:33:54,058
I must have sounded odd
At the supermarket
The other day.

505
00:33:56,060 --> 00:33:58,062
See, you're
Tony's therapist.

506
00:33:59,355 --> 00:34:00,856
Whether
It's appropriate...

507
00:34:01,482 --> 00:34:02,858
How can i help you?

508
00:34:04,777 --> 00:34:06,362
It's about my son.

509
00:34:07,154 --> 00:34:08,864
Both kids, really.

510
00:34:09,865 --> 00:34:11,158
The situation

511
00:34:12,868 --> 00:34:15,871
With the shooting.
I'm very worried
About them.

512
00:34:16,080 --> 00:34:17,164
Sure.

513
00:34:18,374 --> 00:34:20,084
It's a very
Serious problem,

514
00:34:21,960 --> 00:34:23,253
You know, guns
In the home.

515
00:34:24,463 --> 00:34:28,258
It's a societal concern.
Obviously, we learned
Our lesson too late.

516
00:34:31,178 --> 00:34:33,681
I immediately removed
All the firearms
From the house

517
00:34:33,764 --> 00:34:36,183
After the goings-on
At tony's uncle's.

518
00:34:37,851 --> 00:34:39,061
Anyway, last night,

519
00:34:39,478 --> 00:34:42,481
I was shrieking
At my son,

520
00:34:43,983 --> 00:34:47,277
And i said something
Very cruel.

521
00:34:50,364 --> 00:34:53,367
And especially since
He's been trying
So hard...

522
00:34:55,285 --> 00:34:57,079
How are you doing?

523
00:34:59,748 --> 00:35:01,667
You know,
I'm frazzled certainly,

524
00:35:01,750 --> 00:35:03,752
But i am more
Worried about them.

525
00:35:03,961 --> 00:35:05,671
They're not kids anymore.

526
00:35:06,171 --> 00:35:07,548
When they were young,

527
00:35:08,382 --> 00:35:10,759
There were certain things
We could tell them
About tony's life.

528
00:35:10,968 --> 00:35:14,763
You know, lies.
We'll just call
Them what they were.

529
00:35:15,055 --> 00:35:17,349
- but now...
- so the issue
Isn't just

530
00:35:18,058 --> 00:35:19,560
Guns in the home.

531
00:35:26,650 --> 00:35:29,153
Honestly, i think
About my son in front
Of those cameras,

532
00:35:29,278 --> 00:35:31,155
Having to vouch
For all this.

533
00:35:31,864 --> 00:35:33,365
<i>my daughter
And her friends.</i>

534
00:35:34,158 --> 00:35:35,451
They have to face

535
00:35:35,659 --> 00:35:38,370
All these years
Of facading.

536
00:35:39,163 --> 00:35:40,748
They do or you do?

537
00:35:43,667 --> 00:35:46,462
The minute i met tony,
I knew who that guy was.

538
00:35:47,254 --> 00:35:50,758
On my second date,
He brought me and my
Mother each a dozen roses

539
00:35:50,883 --> 00:35:53,260
And my father
A $200 power drill.

540
00:35:54,345 --> 00:35:57,181
Not the typical story
Of young love.

541
00:36:01,185 --> 00:36:03,854
And i don't know
If i loved him
In spite of it...

542
00:36:07,983 --> 00:36:09,485
Or because of it.

543
00:36:12,071 --> 00:36:13,864
Parents
Weren't like that.

544
00:36:15,574 --> 00:36:16,659
And i knew,

545
00:36:16,784 --> 00:36:19,578
Whether consciously or not,
I knew that behind
That power drill,

546
00:36:19,745 --> 00:36:22,164
There was probably
Some guy with
A broken arm,

547
00:36:22,247 --> 00:36:23,874
You know, or worse.

548
00:36:25,584 --> 00:36:27,753
And you coped
With that, how?

549
00:36:30,547 --> 00:36:32,466
I'd go to my priest,
And i would cry,

550
00:36:32,549 --> 00:36:35,260
And say how bad i felt
About how my husband
Made his money,

551
00:36:35,469 --> 00:36:36,762
But that was bullshit.

552
00:36:38,472 --> 00:36:41,266
Because there are
Far bigger crooks
Than my husband.

553
00:36:47,648 --> 00:36:48,983
But the kids...

554
00:36:49,984 --> 00:36:53,570
They don't decide
Who they're born to.

555
00:36:55,364 --> 00:36:56,657
So now what?

556
00:37:00,160 --> 00:37:02,162
Yeah, that's just it.
Now what?

557
00:37:03,872 --> 00:37:06,083
It's all out
In the open now,
The whole thing.

558
00:37:06,667 --> 00:37:07,876
And them, they're not

559
00:37:08,168 --> 00:37:09,753
<i>in grade school anymore.
They become...</i>

560
00:37:11,463 --> 00:37:13,048
The longer they stay
With us...

561
00:37:15,175 --> 00:37:16,176
Complicit.

562
00:37:18,554 --> 00:37:19,555
Oh, god.

563
00:37:27,479 --> 00:37:31,483
Putting aside the moral
And legal issues,

564
00:37:33,068 --> 00:37:35,571
Clarity can't be
A bad thing.

565
00:37:45,372 --> 00:37:48,584
Tony's second night
In the coma, i told
Him i loved him.

566
00:37:51,045 --> 00:37:53,547
When was the last time
I said that?

567
00:38:01,347 --> 00:38:03,557
Are you afraid you aren't
Going to feel that way

568
00:38:03,766 --> 00:38:05,476
When he wakes up?

569
00:38:10,773 --> 00:38:14,652
Anthony tells me things are
Better between you.

570
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:24,244
I can't breathe.

571
00:38:24,662 --> 00:38:26,455
- it's all right.
- come here, honey.

572
00:38:26,580 --> 00:38:27,581
Can't breathe.

573
00:38:29,375 --> 00:38:30,376
- it's all right.

574
00:38:31,168 --> 00:38:32,252
Can't breathe.

575
00:38:38,550 --> 00:38:39,551
It's okay, honey.

576
00:38:39,760 --> 00:38:40,970
You're gonna be okay.

577
00:38:43,055 --> 00:38:45,182
- what's going on?
- would you move
Your car, please, sir?

578
00:38:46,266 --> 00:38:48,769
Sil, i didn't hear
From you.

579
00:38:52,982 --> 00:38:54,650
Sil's on the canvas now.

580
00:38:54,858 --> 00:38:56,860
Fucking 100% disaster.

581
00:38:57,069 --> 00:38:58,153
Point is, tony goes,

582
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,863
Let's face it,

583
00:39:00,155 --> 00:39:03,659
Somebody's gonna have to
Step into the breach.

584
00:39:05,160 --> 00:39:06,453
I'm a young man.

585
00:39:07,371 --> 00:39:09,581
Now without the weight,

586
00:39:10,457 --> 00:39:11,750
I'm a healthy man

587
00:39:12,960 --> 00:39:14,378
With longevity.

588
00:39:23,971 --> 00:39:25,848
I hear sil
Is at st. Barnabas.

589
00:39:26,056 --> 00:39:28,267
My god, what is
Happening to us
Around here?

590
00:39:28,350 --> 00:39:30,853
Sil's gonna be fine.
You have enough worries.

591
00:39:31,478 --> 00:39:32,646
Listen, sweetheart,

592
00:39:33,355 --> 00:39:35,649
You're expecting
Something, and i can't
Get into specifics,

593
00:39:36,567 --> 00:39:38,068
And tony wouldn't
Want me to,

594
00:39:38,569 --> 00:39:41,864
But there are certain
People looking over our
Shoulders right now.

595
00:39:42,573 --> 00:39:45,659
'S okay, vito.
I'm not expecting anything.
Money's not an issue.

596
00:39:45,868 --> 00:39:48,078
Like you said, i got
Bigger worries,

597
00:39:48,245 --> 00:39:49,580
Like this son of mine.

598
00:39:50,664 --> 00:39:52,458
You gotta trust me
On this, hon.

599
00:39:52,958 --> 00:39:55,169
Suspicions get raised
If we were to move it

600
00:39:55,461 --> 00:39:56,670
To you at this moment.

601
00:39:58,380 --> 00:39:59,465
I got this.

602
00:40:01,258 --> 00:40:03,052
Your ma says
Now's our moment.

603
00:40:03,260 --> 00:40:05,262
The main thing,
When people come
To sit with dad,

604
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:08,849
The doctors want
Positive talk.
- it helps in his recovery.

605
00:40:08,974 --> 00:40:10,059
- got it.

606
00:40:12,269 --> 00:40:13,979
Oof, madonn'
He looks terrible.

607
00:40:14,271 --> 00:40:17,566
Uncle paulie,
You can't say stuff
Like that.

608
00:40:17,775 --> 00:40:19,568
You have to
Stay positive.

609
00:40:19,777 --> 00:40:23,072
Yeah, it's just nothing prepares
You for that.
Uncle paulie!

610
00:40:25,866 --> 00:40:27,951
Only one person
At a time, please.

611
00:40:30,245 --> 00:40:31,747
She's a ballbuster.

612
00:40:32,873 --> 00:40:35,876
Finn's on his way up.
I'll be back in a few
Minutes, okay?

613
00:40:36,251 --> 00:40:38,545
Remember, stay positive.

614
00:41:03,070 --> 00:41:06,573
I gotta wear a jock,
The doc says.
Keep the testes elevated.

615
00:41:10,369 --> 00:41:12,454
Of course, it could
Be a lot worse, right?

616
00:41:13,247 --> 00:41:15,958
They gave me
An ultrasound,
No rupture.

617
00:41:19,753 --> 00:41:23,465
I mean, the good thing is
I hurt it doing a major piece
Of business.

618
00:41:24,550 --> 00:41:27,386
<i>i saw a little action,
And the next thing,</i>

619
00:41:27,553 --> 00:41:29,346
<i>i was at the urologist. </i>

620
00:41:30,681 --> 00:41:34,268
Fucking guy tells me i can't expect
The same things from my body no more.

621
00:41:35,686 --> 00:41:37,980
<i>i tell you, t,
First the eyes,
Then the teeth.</i>

622
00:41:38,272 --> 00:41:40,482
Next you find out
You can't take pissing
For granted.

623
00:41:40,774 --> 00:41:42,151
Some joke, huh?

624
00:41:44,278 --> 00:41:45,571
When i was in the service,

625
00:41:45,654 --> 00:41:48,657
I won the chin-ups cup
Three weeks in a row.

626
00:41:49,074 --> 00:41:51,076
Fucking beautiful
Definition, too.

627
00:41:51,285 --> 00:41:53,746
Guy asked me to model
For the boxing poster.

628
00:41:54,246 --> 00:41:57,875
He was half a fag,
But i was flattered,
Just the same.

629
00:41:58,250 --> 00:41:59,376
Now look at this.

630
00:41:59,585 --> 00:42:02,671
Fucking wrinkles like
An old lady's cunt.

631
00:42:06,467 --> 00:42:07,885
You don't think it's
Gonna happen to you,

632
00:42:08,177 --> 00:42:09,678
But i'm feeling it, tony.

633
00:42:14,683 --> 00:42:16,185
Phineas fogg

634
00:42:16,852 --> 00:42:17,853
Back in town.

635
00:42:18,145 --> 00:42:20,064
He forgets
All the little people.

636
00:42:20,272 --> 00:42:21,357
Hey, vito,

637
00:42:22,066 --> 00:42:24,777
How's mr. Soprano doing?
Let's hope he
Pulls through, huh?

638
00:42:30,074 --> 00:42:31,158
Hi.

639
00:42:34,578 --> 00:42:36,163
So glad you're here.

640
00:42:37,247 --> 00:42:38,248
I'm gonna let
You two lovebirds be.

641
00:42:44,755 --> 00:42:47,174
That-- don't
Worry about him.
He's harmless.

642
00:42:50,052 --> 00:42:51,178
That fucking agita, t.

643
00:42:52,763 --> 00:42:55,474
I mean, do i blame
Myself for this life?
The shit that happens,

644
00:42:55,849 --> 00:42:56,767
Like with puss.

645
00:42:57,059 --> 00:42:59,853
Standup one day,
F.b.i. Rat fuck
The next.

646
00:43:02,064 --> 00:43:04,984
I felt it here, t.
- i felt it right here.

647
00:43:05,150 --> 00:43:07,277
- will you please shut up
In there?

648
00:43:08,779 --> 00:43:09,947
I'm sorry.

649
00:43:11,156 --> 00:43:12,866
Yes, the inn
At the oaks.

650
00:43:15,160 --> 00:43:17,371
Left on
Jamboree boulevard?

651
00:43:19,456 --> 00:43:21,750
Out towards the beacon.

652
00:43:23,460 --> 00:43:25,170
What is that beacon
Anyway?

653
00:43:29,675 --> 00:43:30,968
God damn it!

654
00:43:31,176 --> 00:43:32,469
Shut up!
Shut up in there!

655
00:43:32,761 --> 00:43:33,846
- so i said to ma--

656
00:43:44,273 --> 00:43:45,566
Dr. Budraja,
Stat to room 3.

657
00:43:46,483 --> 00:43:47,985
Nurse, don't leave!

658
00:43:48,569 --> 00:43:49,445
Help!

659
00:43:50,654 --> 00:43:51,864
<i>- out of the way, sir.</i>

660
00:43:52,781 --> 00:43:53,949
What's happening?

661
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:56,869
<i>soprano, v-tach
On the monitor.</i>

662
00:43:57,369 --> 00:43:58,954
- thready pulse.
- take his pressure.
Get a board ready.

663
00:43:59,246 --> 00:44:01,165
- 80 palp.
- all right,
Let's bag him.

664
00:44:02,249 --> 00:44:04,460
Oh my god, is he dying?
Where's my mom?

665
00:44:05,252 --> 00:44:06,462
I don't know
What's happening.

666
00:44:07,671 --> 00:44:08,881
- one, two, three.

667
00:44:12,468 --> 00:44:13,552
Still v-tach at 210.

668
00:44:14,470 --> 00:44:15,846
150 mg. Of amiodaraone.

669
00:44:17,056 --> 00:44:18,557
Grab the paddles.
Clear the room.

670
00:44:18,766 --> 00:44:19,975
Cardiovert at 100.

671
00:44:20,351 --> 00:44:22,061
<i>- dad!
- stand back.</i>

672
00:44:24,146 --> 00:44:25,564
- all clear.
- clear.

673
00:44:28,651 --> 00:44:29,652
200.

674
00:44:30,069 --> 00:44:31,153
- stand back.

675
00:44:31,654 --> 00:44:32,863
- all clear.
- clear.

676
00:45:24,957 --> 00:45:25,874
Excuse me.

677
00:45:26,667 --> 00:45:28,585
Is this
The finnerty reunion?

678
00:45:28,669 --> 00:45:30,671
Hello there.
They're waiting for you.

679
00:45:31,171 --> 00:45:32,881
- me?
- of course.

680
00:45:35,759 --> 00:45:38,762
- has kevin finnerty arrived?
- we don't talk like that here.

681
00:45:39,471 --> 00:45:40,973
What do you mean?

682
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:43,183
Your family's inside.

683
00:45:46,145 --> 00:45:48,647
- what family?
- they're here to welcome you.

684
00:45:49,565 --> 00:45:50,774
I don't understand.

685
00:45:51,275 --> 00:45:53,569
- you're going home.
- i am?

686
00:46:08,667 --> 00:46:10,169
Everyone's in there.

687
00:46:17,760 --> 00:46:20,179
<i>- you can't bring
Business in there.
- girl: daddy.</i>

688
00:46:24,558 --> 00:46:27,561
I lost my real briefcase.
My whole life was in it.

689
00:46:29,563 --> 00:46:31,148
<i>don't go, daddy.</i>

690
00:46:35,778 --> 00:46:36,570
- what is that?

691
00:46:37,279 --> 00:46:38,656
- briefcases aren't allowed.

692
00:46:39,073 --> 00:46:40,282
- no, the voice.

693
00:46:40,366 --> 00:46:41,659
- please, let me
Take that from you.

694
00:46:43,369 --> 00:46:44,662
- looks like
It weighs a ton.

695
00:46:44,953 --> 00:46:47,581
- i don't want to.
Well, you need to.
You need to let go.

696
00:46:48,957 --> 00:46:50,959
<i>we love you, daddy.
Don't leave us.</i>

697
00:47:04,181 --> 00:47:05,182
For some reason...

698
00:47:07,059 --> 00:47:07,977
I'm scared.

699
00:47:08,185 --> 00:47:09,561
Well, there's nothing
To be scared of.

700
00:47:12,272 --> 00:47:13,649
You can let it go.

701
00:47:14,984 --> 00:47:16,068
Just come say hello.

702
00:47:18,946 --> 00:47:19,780
All right.

703
00:47:24,576 --> 00:47:25,577
<i>- daddy!</i>

704
00:47:29,373 --> 00:47:31,875
<i>please don't leave us,
Daddy.  We love you.</i>

705
00:47:44,847 --> 00:47:45,973
<i>dad?</i>

706
00:47:46,765 --> 00:47:48,058
His eyes are open.

707
00:47:49,476 --> 00:47:50,477
Daddy, look at
Me right here.

708
00:47:52,646 --> 00:47:54,857
<i>all right, normal
Sinus rhythm.
- pulse and pressure?</i>

709
00:47:54,982 --> 00:47:56,984
<i>- nurse: good.
Oh my god! Thank god. Thank god.</i>

710
00:47:59,945 --> 00:48:01,071
<i>hang an amiodaraone drip</i>

711
00:48:01,363 --> 00:48:03,449
<i>and send off a set
Of electrolytes now.</i>

712
00:48:04,366 --> 00:48:06,577
Dad, look,
Here you are.

713
00:48:10,956 --> 00:48:13,083
So i'm holding his hand,
And all of a sudden

714
00:48:13,375 --> 00:48:15,085
<i>the machines
Go bullshit.</i>

715
00:48:15,377 --> 00:48:16,754
You told us,
For christ's sake.

716
00:48:16,962 --> 00:48:18,672
Those fucking doctors,
It's their fault.

717
00:48:19,673 --> 00:48:21,675
- skip's gonna make it.
He's conscious.

718
00:48:24,261 --> 00:48:25,179
Oh, thank god!

719
00:48:48,952 --> 00:48:50,162
I got it, honey.

720
00:48:53,248 --> 00:48:56,460
- fuck took you so long?
- i had to get it together,
Didn't i?

721
00:49:01,256 --> 00:49:03,050
We gotta get
That cut to her now.

722
00:49:03,258 --> 00:49:05,844
Easy, that's
A fucking guilty move.

723
00:49:06,762 --> 00:49:08,472
Tony's conscious.
You capisce?

724
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:10,975
Everybody and his mother was in there
Talking to him

725
00:49:11,183 --> 00:49:14,353
When he was in that coma. Carmela.
Who knows what the fuck they said?

726
00:49:15,270 --> 00:49:16,146
Maybe

727
00:49:16,355 --> 00:49:17,648
He's expecting
That money.

728
00:49:25,781 --> 00:49:27,950
He can't talk yet
Because of the tube

729
00:49:28,158 --> 00:49:31,453
That was in his throat.
Maybe we should consider
Ourselves lucky there.

730
00:49:34,748 --> 00:49:36,875
But we are very happy,
Aren't we?

731
00:49:38,085 --> 00:49:40,254
Anthony, you had us
So worried.

732
00:49:40,671 --> 00:49:43,882
I haven't been
To church that much
Since i quit playing bingo.

733
00:49:47,261 --> 00:49:48,262
What, honey?

734
00:49:51,348 --> 00:49:52,850
I'm dead, right?

735
00:49:57,354 --> 00:49:59,982
No no, you're
In the hospital
With all of us.

736
00:50:00,774 --> 00:50:01,984
In newark.

737
00:50:02,359 --> 00:50:03,777
Mr. Soprano,
How are you today?

738
00:50:04,570 --> 00:50:06,780
I'm dr. Vahapsideh.
I'm a neologist.

739
00:50:13,162 --> 00:50:14,663
How's he doing,
Sweetheart?

740
00:50:15,164 --> 00:50:17,166
I don't know if we're
Out of the woods yet,
But he's hanging in.

741
00:50:17,374 --> 00:50:21,378
He just passed his
First simple mental
Acuity test, so...

742
00:50:21,670 --> 00:50:24,173
Your strength,
That was the difference.

743
00:50:28,469 --> 00:50:30,054
Oh, a little something
From us.

744
00:50:31,764 --> 00:50:34,058
Help defray medical costs,
Rehabilitation.

745
00:50:34,266 --> 00:50:37,186
Jesus, i don't know
What to say.

746
00:50:37,853 --> 00:50:41,065
- this is what we do, honey.
- i'd want the same for my marie.

747
00:50:41,482 --> 00:50:42,775
Or my ma.

748
00:50:50,074 --> 00:50:51,367
We're here if you need anything.

749
00:51:10,052 --> 00:51:11,971
Great fucking news, t.

750
00:51:15,766 --> 00:51:17,559
See you're up
And around.

751
00:51:21,855 --> 00:51:22,856
Best.

752
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:36,870
"sometimes i go about
In pity for myself,

753
00:51:37,871 --> 00:51:39,248
<i>and all the while,</i>

754
00:51:39,456 --> 00:51:41,959
<i>a great wind carries me
Across the sky.</i>

755
00:51:42,751 --> 00:51:44,253
Ojibwe saying."

756
00:51:45,045 --> 00:51:46,171
Indians, right?

757
00:51:49,049 --> 00:51:49,967
Who put this up?

758
00:51:56,265 --> 00:51:58,976
Listen, t,
Something i wanted
To talk to you about.

759
00:52:05,065 --> 00:52:07,067
I'm gonna take another run
At the movie business.

760
00:52:10,779 --> 00:52:11,780
I know

761
00:52:12,072 --> 00:52:14,575
You haven't
Liked that in the past,

762
00:52:14,783 --> 00:52:16,368
But i'm going about it
In a whole different way.

763
00:52:16,869 --> 00:52:18,078
In fact,

764
00:52:18,454 --> 00:52:21,248
I'm hoping you'll become an
Investor when you feel
A little better,

765
00:52:21,373 --> 00:52:24,251
And i can explain
What we're doing.
It's pretty exciting.

766
00:52:24,585 --> 00:52:27,755
We'll own the neg. That's what
They call it. It means negative.

767
00:52:31,258 --> 00:52:33,469
I'm holding a large
Ownership position

768
00:52:33,677 --> 00:52:36,680
Open for you.
I hope you approve.

769
00:52:40,267 --> 00:52:41,352
Actually,

770
00:52:42,978 --> 00:52:44,146
Frankly...,

771
00:52:44,772 --> 00:52:46,357
All due respect,

772
00:52:47,358 --> 00:52:48,359
I think you owe me this,

773
00:52:50,277 --> 00:52:51,945
As i came to you
About adriana.

774
00:52:54,365 --> 00:52:56,784
<i>you've got him up?
I know how it looks,</i>

775
00:52:57,076 --> 00:52:59,453
But he should be upright
As much as possible.

776
00:52:59,870 --> 00:53:01,163
- i'm gonna leave
You two alone.

777
00:53:01,372 --> 00:53:02,581
- thanks for everything.

778
00:53:10,881 --> 00:53:12,967
I don't know
How you do it.

779
00:53:30,067 --> 00:53:32,277
That's gotta feel
Good, huh?

780
00:53:33,779 --> 00:53:35,280
The simple things.
