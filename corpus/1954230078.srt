1
00:00:05,805 --> 00:00:06,571
Action!

2
00:00:06,606 --> 00:00:07,672
Move! Move, damn it!

3
00:00:07,707 --> 00:00:08,940
Damn it, move!

4
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,710
This is the opening of
"24: Live Another Day."

5
00:00:11,744 --> 00:00:14,745
We start with CIA ops chasing somebody.

6
00:00:14,779 --> 00:00:17,482
The series begins running, you know?

7
00:00:17,516 --> 00:00:18,882
Freeze it right there.

8
00:00:18,917 --> 00:00:21,586
That Jack Bauer has survived,
intact, to live another day

9
00:00:21,620 --> 00:00:23,354
is good news for a lot of people.

10
00:00:23,388 --> 00:00:25,389
What the hell have you been
doing the past four years?

11
00:00:25,424 --> 00:00:27,558
I was really excited
that "24" was coming back.

12
00:00:27,593 --> 00:00:28,759
I couldn't believe it.

13
00:00:29,928 --> 00:00:31,095
There's fireballs. There's action.

14
00:00:31,129 --> 00:00:33,897
It's all good, "24" kind of stuff.

15
00:00:33,932 --> 00:00:35,232
It's a high-octane thriller

16
00:00:35,266 --> 00:00:36,867
with, literally, time ticking down.

17
00:00:36,901 --> 00:00:39,236
- It's a self-destruct program.
- Damn it!

18
00:00:39,270 --> 00:00:40,838
Why is he here? Why is he back?

19
00:00:40,872 --> 00:00:42,305
Jack Bauer is a traitor and a psychopath.

20
00:00:42,340 --> 00:00:44,174
Is he here to harm the president?

21
00:00:44,208 --> 00:00:45,242
Is he here to help the president?

22
00:00:45,276 --> 00:00:46,610
We don't know.

23
00:00:46,644 --> 00:00:49,112
If an American president is
assassinated on foreign soil,

24
00:00:49,147 --> 00:00:50,580
you're looking at a world war.

25
00:00:50,615 --> 00:00:53,683
London and the CIA will never be the same.

26
00:01:00,758 --> 00:01:01,758
Man: Action!

27
00:01:03,694 --> 00:01:04,827
It's Bauer.

28
00:01:04,862 --> 00:01:07,596
This year, we have some
crazy stuff coming up,

29
00:01:07,631 --> 00:01:09,632
stuff we haven't done before.

30
00:01:09,667 --> 00:01:12,068
Coto: It's a story that starts
from moment one, this season.

31
00:01:12,102 --> 00:01:14,203
The train is already moving,
and you got to run to catch up.

32
00:01:14,237 --> 00:01:17,373
And you're on for a ride from
episode one all the way through.

33
00:01:17,407 --> 00:01:18,340
There's not one letup.

34
00:01:18,375 --> 00:01:19,341
Simone: Help me!

35
00:01:19,376 --> 00:01:21,177
What's wonderful is it is "24,"

36
00:01:21,211 --> 00:01:23,479
but it's a new iteration of "24."

37
00:01:23,513 --> 00:01:26,248
The show is set in London, England.

38
00:01:26,283 --> 00:01:29,618
And it's the first time we've
actually shot fully on location.

39
00:01:29,653 --> 00:01:31,187
What brings Jack to London

40
00:01:31,221 --> 00:01:33,222
is he's been out of the United States

41
00:01:33,256 --> 00:01:35,658
since the very end of season eight.

42
00:01:35,692 --> 00:01:38,160
He managed to escape to Eastern Europe,

43
00:01:38,194 --> 00:01:39,795
where he's been underground
for 4 1/2 years...

44
00:01:39,829 --> 00:01:41,563
Man: Target acquired.

45
00:01:41,597 --> 00:01:46,001
And has resurfaced because of
the circumstances of the day,

46
00:01:46,035 --> 00:01:49,037
to protect the president
of the Untied States.

47
00:01:49,072 --> 00:01:50,672
Katz: James Heller,
played by William Devane,

48
00:01:50,707 --> 00:01:53,208
was formerly in the series
as the secretary of defense.

49
00:01:53,242 --> 00:01:55,343
President Heller, In
this case, is in London.

50
00:01:55,377 --> 00:01:57,745
Man: People have never been comfortable

51
00:01:57,779 --> 00:02:00,682
with our using drones for
targeted assassinations.

52
00:02:00,716 --> 00:02:02,383
Mr. President?

53
00:02:02,418 --> 00:02:04,385
I'm thinking I don't blame them.

54
00:02:04,420 --> 00:02:07,722
Devane: We're here to negotiate
a treaty... a drone treaty.

55
00:02:07,756 --> 00:02:09,456
It's a precarious situation,

56
00:02:09,490 --> 00:02:13,861
so I have to come and
actually do it myself.

57
00:02:13,895 --> 00:02:15,362
James: I think the most important thing

58
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:20,034
is for the prime minister
to hear the news from me.

59
00:02:20,068 --> 00:02:22,302
Katz: And while he's there, of course,

60
00:02:22,337 --> 00:02:24,872
Jack emerges with news of an attack.

61
00:02:24,906 --> 00:02:28,108
The question being asked in the
initial part of the series is,

62
00:02:28,142 --> 00:02:31,411
"is Jack Bauer there to
assassinate the president?"

63
00:02:31,446 --> 00:02:33,280
Gordon: Jack is an international fugitive,

64
00:02:33,314 --> 00:02:35,415
and he's wanted, not just by our country,

65
00:02:35,450 --> 00:02:36,950
but by every country.

66
00:02:36,984 --> 00:02:38,885
I know How many lives you've saved,

67
00:02:38,919 --> 00:02:40,987
but they're just gonna
see a man who snapped,

68
00:02:41,021 --> 00:02:43,389
who went off on a... a revenge spree.

69
00:02:43,423 --> 00:02:45,258
A man whose country labels him a criminal.

70
00:02:45,292 --> 00:02:46,860
Coto: Fans of the series remember,

71
00:02:46,894 --> 00:02:49,062
you know, Jack left off as a fugitive.

72
00:02:49,096 --> 00:02:51,898
You were really something...

73
00:02:51,932 --> 00:02:52,899
in your time.

74
00:02:52,933 --> 00:02:54,667
Basically, CTU was turned off,

75
00:02:54,701 --> 00:02:56,102
and Jack was left in the darkness.

76
00:02:56,137 --> 00:02:59,605
And now a CIA team is hunting down Jack.

77
00:02:59,640 --> 00:03:00,740
[Groans]

78
00:03:00,774 --> 00:03:01,741
Man: Cut!

79
00:03:01,775 --> 00:03:03,075
But Jack is onto something,

80
00:03:03,109 --> 00:03:05,478
and there's much more than
just him having been caught.

81
00:03:05,512 --> 00:03:07,546
There's a larger mystery
that he's trying to uncover.

82
00:03:07,581 --> 00:03:09,248
Cassar: Why is he here? Why is he back?

83
00:03:09,283 --> 00:03:11,216
Does this have something
to do with the president?

84
00:03:11,251 --> 00:03:13,252
And does it have something
to do with these drones?

85
00:03:13,287 --> 00:03:14,687
So, really, that becomes our mystery.

86
00:03:14,721 --> 00:03:16,789
Two weeks ago, I intercepted intel framing

87
00:03:16,823 --> 00:03:18,623
an assassination attempt
on President Heller

88
00:03:18,658 --> 00:03:20,425
supposed to take place
in London... here, today.

89
00:03:20,459 --> 00:03:22,394
- You're gonna help me.
- I'm afraid I can't do that.

90
00:03:22,428 --> 00:03:23,862
But you don't have a choice.

91
00:03:23,897 --> 00:03:27,166
Gordon: Despite being hunted
and... and being made a pariah,

92
00:03:27,200 --> 00:03:29,802
Jack is still a hero.
He cannot help himself.

93
00:03:29,836 --> 00:03:31,203
Has anyone ever mentioned

94
00:03:31,237 --> 00:03:33,538
your rather... spectacularly rude habit

95
00:03:33,572 --> 00:03:36,874
of asking for favors accompanied
by the threat of a gun?

96
00:03:38,311 --> 00:03:40,545
Sutherland: What brought me
back was really Howard Gordon,

97
00:03:40,579 --> 00:03:42,246
who was our lead writer.

98
00:03:42,281 --> 00:03:44,882
Called me up and said, "Look,
I've... I've had this idea

99
00:03:44,917 --> 00:03:46,884
"for about 12 episodes for a while,

100
00:03:46,919 --> 00:03:49,553
"and it's kind of just gnawing at me.

101
00:03:49,587 --> 00:03:50,822
Would you be interested in doing it?"

102
00:03:50,856 --> 00:03:52,756
Gordon: We really wanted to see Jack Bauer.

103
00:03:52,791 --> 00:03:54,558
Look, it's really like
seeing an old friend again.

104
00:03:55,794 --> 00:03:57,594
And I have to say, when we saw the dailies

105
00:03:57,629 --> 00:03:59,363
of Jack Bauer for the first time,

106
00:03:59,397 --> 00:04:01,199
we just all smiled and
looked at each other.

107
00:04:01,233 --> 00:04:03,400
Katz: He really looks great. He's cut.

108
00:04:03,435 --> 00:04:06,002
He looks like someone who's been living raw

109
00:04:06,037 --> 00:04:07,571
and on the edge for years.

110
00:04:07,605 --> 00:04:08,806
You know who I am.

111
00:04:08,840 --> 00:04:10,774
Trigger an alarm, and
I'll blow your head off.

112
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,677
I think he found Jack again pretty quickly.

113
00:04:13,712 --> 00:04:16,847
Kiefer and Jack Bauer are pretty
well connected at this point.

114
00:04:16,881 --> 00:04:17,914
We didn't waste any time.

115
00:04:17,949 --> 00:04:19,182
Our first week,

116
00:04:19,217 --> 00:04:22,352
we were just stock blocked
with action and dialogue,

117
00:04:22,386 --> 00:04:25,255
so he had to fit into and he
had to do it quickly, and he did.

118
00:04:25,289 --> 00:04:28,225
Sutherland: And it is very
exciting to be Jack Bauer again.

119
00:04:28,259 --> 00:04:29,259
Move!

120
00:04:29,293 --> 00:04:31,694
Gordon: It is not just Kiefer, of course.

121
00:04:31,729 --> 00:04:34,297
A good number of the old
team are back together.

122
00:04:34,332 --> 00:04:36,532
It was like the band
came together for this.

123
00:04:36,567 --> 00:04:38,000
Evan is a... is a... is a veteran.

124
00:04:38,034 --> 00:04:39,702
<i>He's the most veteran writer on the show...</i>

125
00:04:39,737 --> 00:04:42,037
was there since season two,
and I came in at season five.

126
00:04:42,072 --> 00:04:44,407
Katz: We're lucky enough
to get John Cassar back,

127
00:04:44,441 --> 00:04:46,642
who was our producer
and director for years.

128
00:04:46,677 --> 00:04:49,078
Cassar: I've done 58
episodes and the TV movie,

129
00:04:49,112 --> 00:04:52,147
so to have it come back
again is very exciting.

130
00:04:52,182 --> 00:04:54,984
Sutherland: Jon directed so
many of the seasons of "24"

131
00:04:55,018 --> 00:04:56,785
that I really do rely on him greatly.

132
00:04:56,819 --> 00:04:57,987
Action!

133
00:04:58,021 --> 00:04:59,821
We're gonna push this as hard as we can.

134
00:04:59,856 --> 00:05:01,223
If we lose the base,

135
00:05:01,258 --> 00:05:02,758
those men will have died in vain!

136
00:05:02,792 --> 00:05:04,159
Look, I'm not saying we quit.

137
00:05:04,194 --> 00:05:06,228
I'm just suggesting that we withdraw,

138
00:05:06,263 --> 00:05:08,597
wait until the rancor dies down.

139
00:05:08,631 --> 00:05:09,831
I don't have time.

140
00:05:09,866 --> 00:05:11,833
Katz: We're doing 12
episodes, instead of 24.

141
00:05:11,868 --> 00:05:14,703
This is a special-event series.

142
00:05:14,737 --> 00:05:15,771
Here we go!

143
00:05:15,805 --> 00:05:16,772
Those 12 episodes

144
00:05:16,806 --> 00:05:18,707
are still gonna represent one full day.

145
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,909
Somewhere within it,

146
00:05:20,943 --> 00:05:23,077
we're going to skip an hour
or two, or maybe a big chunk.

147
00:05:23,112 --> 00:05:25,079
Sutherland: We're not
trying to change the show.

148
00:05:25,114 --> 00:05:27,515
Jack is not gonna be skipping.

149
00:05:27,549 --> 00:05:29,884
You know, it's not gonna
be a romantic comedy.

150
00:05:29,919 --> 00:05:31,219
He's gonna have a crappy day,

151
00:05:31,253 --> 00:05:32,820
and he's gonna fight his way through it,

152
00:05:32,854 --> 00:05:34,655
and... and... and that's what the show is.

153
00:05:34,689 --> 00:05:36,925
Certain dynamics are different,
but the show isn't different.

154
00:05:36,959 --> 00:05:38,259
You're going after the wrong guy.

155
00:05:38,294 --> 00:05:40,728
Cassar: I think all the
action and special effects

156
00:05:40,762 --> 00:05:42,563
are what you usually expect on "24,"

157
00:05:42,597 --> 00:05:44,097
and, really, that's what I'm going for...

158
00:05:44,132 --> 00:05:46,166
and maybe a little beyond what you expect,

159
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,435
and that's what we always,

160
00:05:47,469 --> 00:05:50,137
I think, expect our
audience to expect from us.

161
00:05:50,171 --> 00:05:51,672
Action!

162
00:05:51,706 --> 00:05:53,741
Cut. Yeah, baby!

163
00:05:53,775 --> 00:05:55,609
[Claps] That's the one.

164
00:06:03,539 --> 00:06:05,473
[Beeping]

165
00:06:07,209 --> 00:06:10,044
This year may be my favorite
cast that we've ever had.

166
00:06:10,078 --> 00:06:11,078
It's extraordinary.

167
00:06:11,112 --> 00:06:12,713
Cassar: First, we've got some characters

168
00:06:12,748 --> 00:06:14,015
that you loved that we've brought back.

169
00:06:14,049 --> 00:06:15,550
My God. Chloe.

170
00:06:15,584 --> 00:06:16,717
Woman: What happened to you?

171
00:06:16,752 --> 00:06:18,218
Coto: The notorious Chloe O'Brian.

172
00:06:18,253 --> 00:06:20,855
Chloe's not nearly the same individual

173
00:06:20,889 --> 00:06:22,757
that we saw in season eight.

174
00:06:22,791 --> 00:06:24,158
Rajskub: Chloe is with the group

175
00:06:24,192 --> 00:06:26,626
that believes in information being freed.

176
00:06:26,661 --> 00:06:29,530
They have no qualms
about letting out secrets.

177
00:06:29,564 --> 00:06:31,998
It's the opposite of how
Chloe used to believe.

178
00:06:32,033 --> 00:06:33,267
Coto: She has turned anti-government.

179
00:06:33,301 --> 00:06:34,568
She has become

180
00:06:34,602 --> 00:06:37,237
kind of like a darker
version of Edward Snowden.

181
00:06:37,272 --> 00:06:38,972
Intelligence agencies keep secrets

182
00:06:39,006 --> 00:06:40,907
because what they're doing is criminal.

183
00:06:40,942 --> 00:06:42,442
That's naive, even for you.

184
00:06:42,476 --> 00:06:43,577
You're smarter than that.

185
00:06:43,611 --> 00:06:45,211
You don't get to judge me,

186
00:06:45,245 --> 00:06:46,580
not after what I've been through.

187
00:06:46,614 --> 00:06:49,015
Rajskub: Chloe and Jack start out at odds

188
00:06:49,050 --> 00:06:51,851
because Jack has kind
of come out of nowhere

189
00:06:51,886 --> 00:06:53,553
and wants her to go with him

190
00:06:53,588 --> 00:06:59,192
and help him to stop this
plot against the president.

191
00:06:59,226 --> 00:07:02,128
Jack, in four years of hiding,
doesn't really trust anybody,

192
00:07:02,162 --> 00:07:04,464
and Chloe has gone
through her own evolution.

193
00:07:04,498 --> 00:07:07,633
And they don't start off
as the best of friends.

194
00:07:07,667 --> 00:07:09,668
We're not the same Chloe
and Jack as we were,

195
00:07:09,703 --> 00:07:10,936
and we're not seeing eye to eye.

196
00:07:10,971 --> 00:07:13,005
Chloe: Why are you doing this, Jack?

197
00:07:13,039 --> 00:07:15,107
Some fantasy that, if you save Heller,

198
00:07:15,141 --> 00:07:16,341
all will be forgiven?

199
00:07:16,375 --> 00:07:18,611
You knew Heller. You know he's a good man.

200
00:07:18,645 --> 00:07:20,613
<i>No, I don't know that.</i>

201
00:07:20,647 --> 00:07:23,381
William Devane is reprising
his role as Heller.

202
00:07:23,416 --> 00:07:25,084
Devane: I'm now the president,

203
00:07:25,118 --> 00:07:28,353
the most powerful man in the free world.

204
00:07:28,387 --> 00:07:30,388
Katz: His daughter Audrey,

205
00:07:30,423 --> 00:07:33,825
who Jack was deeply in
love with, and she with him,

206
00:07:33,859 --> 00:07:37,996
but who ended up going to
China and being tortured

207
00:07:38,030 --> 00:07:40,298
for information about Jack.

208
00:07:40,333 --> 00:07:44,102
Audrey is a lot better than
when we last saw her. [Chuckles]

209
00:07:44,137 --> 00:07:46,971
Audrey is working again with her dad.

210
00:07:47,006 --> 00:07:48,439
I know that look.

211
00:07:48,473 --> 00:07:49,941
What's your problem?

212
00:07:49,975 --> 00:07:52,276
Devane: She's like the
lady of the White House.

213
00:07:52,310 --> 00:07:54,145
Her mother passed away years ago,

214
00:07:54,179 --> 00:07:57,782
so she basically does everything with me.

215
00:07:57,816 --> 00:07:59,550
It's sort of that thing, you know,

216
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:03,254
when someone has gone
through a really hard time,

217
00:08:03,288 --> 00:08:07,191
I think people are fragile around her

218
00:08:07,225 --> 00:08:08,359
and kind of protecting her.

219
00:08:08,393 --> 00:08:10,561
Katz: She's also married
to his chief of staff,

220
00:08:10,595 --> 00:08:13,164
the man who helped her come back

221
00:08:13,198 --> 00:08:16,933
from... from a near-catatonic
mental breakdown.

222
00:08:16,968 --> 00:08:18,702
Donovan: I play Mark Boudreau,

223
00:08:18,736 --> 00:08:19,836
and he is the chief of staff

224
00:08:19,871 --> 00:08:21,504
to the president of the United States.

225
00:08:21,539 --> 00:08:24,875
Coto: Tate Donovan is a great
character this season, Boudreau.

226
00:08:24,909 --> 00:08:27,678
He's operating purely from
pain in his opposition to Bauer,

227
00:08:27,712 --> 00:08:29,746
who he sees as a threat,
not only to the country

228
00:08:29,781 --> 00:08:33,150
but to his wife and to her
well-being, to her sanity.

229
00:08:33,184 --> 00:08:34,718
The president should be made aware.

230
00:08:34,752 --> 00:08:35,852
You weren't there.

231
00:08:35,887 --> 00:08:38,454
You didn't see what
Bauer did to his family...

232
00:08:38,489 --> 00:08:40,290
what he did to Audrey.

233
00:08:40,324 --> 00:08:43,693
He really does not like Jack Bauer.

234
00:08:43,727 --> 00:08:44,860
As long as she lives,

235
00:08:44,895 --> 00:08:46,729
she's never gonna hear the name Jack Bauer.

236
00:08:46,763 --> 00:08:48,231
Donovan: In the first episode,

237
00:08:48,265 --> 00:08:50,800
I order his death or something terrible,

238
00:08:50,834 --> 00:08:55,437
and, you know, that doesn't
bode well for a character,

239
00:08:55,471 --> 00:08:57,406
if you order Jack Bauer's death.

240
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,407
[Laughs]

241
00:08:58,441 --> 00:09:00,542
Coto: So, it's an interesting triangle

242
00:09:00,577 --> 00:09:03,179
that's kind of cracked apart
when... when Jack appears.

243
00:09:03,213 --> 00:09:04,646
Katz: With Tate Donovan,

244
00:09:04,681 --> 00:09:06,515
we have several new people that feel like

245
00:09:06,549 --> 00:09:07,683
they were born to be on the show.

246
00:09:07,718 --> 00:09:09,651
Where in God's name have you been?

247
00:09:09,686 --> 00:09:11,853
Chloe is working with the
leader of a hacker group.

248
00:09:11,887 --> 00:09:15,190
His name is Adrian Cross, and
he's played by Michael Wincott.

249
00:09:15,225 --> 00:09:19,261
And he's a charismatic,
almost prophet-like figure

250
00:09:19,295 --> 00:09:23,098
who presides over this group of misfits

251
00:09:23,132 --> 00:09:25,200
who help him dig out
information about governments

252
00:09:25,235 --> 00:09:26,835
and spread it.

253
00:09:26,869 --> 00:09:29,570
We acquire and disseminate
information... nothing more.

254
00:09:29,605 --> 00:09:33,208
You make it sound like
what you do is benign.

255
00:09:33,242 --> 00:09:35,509
We both know that's not true.

256
00:09:35,544 --> 00:09:38,479
Gordon: The CIA station
chief is Agent Navarro,

257
00:09:38,513 --> 00:09:40,014
who's played by Benjamin Bratt.

258
00:09:40,049 --> 00:09:41,382
Bratt: For me as an actor,

259
00:09:41,416 --> 00:09:43,551
to be invited to come on
board and... and participate,

260
00:09:43,585 --> 00:09:46,487
to really jump on board this roller coaster

261
00:09:46,521 --> 00:09:48,522
that is a global phenomenon
has been a real thrill.

262
00:09:48,557 --> 00:09:49,523
Man: Cut!

263
00:09:49,558 --> 00:09:51,425
With "24," you can never be certain

264
00:09:51,460 --> 00:09:53,561
that someone is what they say they are.

265
00:09:53,595 --> 00:09:56,297
But what I know of who
I play, at this point,

266
00:09:56,331 --> 00:09:58,165
is that he is a calm leader.

267
00:09:58,199 --> 00:10:00,801
He's cautious. He's very thorough.

268
00:10:00,835 --> 00:10:03,403
Hey, um...

269
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:04,604
sorry I shut you down.

270
00:10:04,639 --> 00:10:08,375
Strahovski: I play Kate
Morgan, the CIA agent.

271
00:10:08,409 --> 00:10:10,710
When we meet her, she's packing
up because she's being demoted.

272
00:10:10,745 --> 00:10:13,313
Coto: Her husband was
revealed to be a traitor,

273
00:10:13,347 --> 00:10:14,915
selling secrets to the Chinese,

274
00:10:14,949 --> 00:10:18,485
and she's about to be
transferred back to the States.

275
00:10:18,519 --> 00:10:22,054
Strahovski: Before that, she
was a pretty great field agent,

276
00:10:22,089 --> 00:10:25,392
very impulsive, and one
of the best that they had.

277
00:10:25,426 --> 00:10:27,560
- Katz: She sees capturing Bauer
- Bang! Bang!

278
00:10:27,595 --> 00:10:29,829
- As her way of redeeming herself.
- Drop your weapon!

279
00:10:29,863 --> 00:10:31,431
- Turn around!
- Bratt: She has instincts that

280
00:10:31,465 --> 00:10:34,200
are very in sync with Jack
Bauer when he was a young agent,

281
00:10:34,234 --> 00:10:36,735
and goes a long way to proving herself

282
00:10:36,770 --> 00:10:38,838
to be reestablished as part of my crew.

283
00:10:38,872 --> 00:10:40,773
I'm the one that got inside Bauer's head...

284
00:10:40,808 --> 00:10:42,741
not you, not Erik, not anybody.

285
00:10:42,776 --> 00:10:44,343
She has to go
head-to-head with Jack,

286
00:10:44,377 --> 00:10:46,245
and that's not easy to
do, for anybody to do.

287
00:10:46,280 --> 00:10:47,613
Erik: What is she doing here?

288
00:10:47,647 --> 00:10:50,282
I reinstated her, Just
until we get Bauer back.

289
00:10:50,317 --> 00:10:52,451
Erik Ritter arrived at the station

290
00:10:52,485 --> 00:10:54,920
to take Kate's job when she transfers out,

291
00:10:54,954 --> 00:10:56,622
and he's impatiently waiting.

292
00:10:56,656 --> 00:10:57,790
She might be trying to prove herself.

293
00:10:57,824 --> 00:10:58,957
I don't care.

294
00:10:58,991 --> 00:11:00,793
But you don't expect me
to work with her, do you?

295
00:11:00,827 --> 00:11:02,894
I expect you to do your job
without questioning my orders.

296
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:05,731
Gbenga, who, of course, everyone
knows from "The Wire" fame,

297
00:11:05,765 --> 00:11:07,299
is Erik.

298
00:11:07,333 --> 00:11:09,801
Erik thinks that Kate
is not fit to do the job.

299
00:11:09,836 --> 00:11:11,970
She may have been at one
point, but not any longer,

300
00:11:12,004 --> 00:11:13,504
and he is, and he'll do it well.

301
00:11:13,539 --> 00:11:14,572
Navarro: Kate Morgan isn't there.

302
00:11:14,606 --> 00:11:15,606
She's not even on the books.

303
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:18,276
This goes bad, it's on you.

304
00:11:18,311 --> 00:11:20,045
When it looks like she's gaining traction,

305
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:21,847
he's very threatened at first.

306
00:11:21,881 --> 00:11:23,280
Cut them loose!

307
00:11:24,115 --> 00:11:25,616
Kate: Leave him.

308
00:11:25,651 --> 00:11:27,117
Are you out of your mind?!

309
00:11:27,152 --> 00:11:29,320
He's coming with us. He knows something.

310
00:11:30,155 --> 00:11:32,457
This was not your fault.

311
00:11:32,491 --> 00:11:35,259
Margot, our main
antagonist, our main villain,

312
00:11:35,293 --> 00:11:39,663
is a woman who swears her
revenge on President Heller.

313
00:11:39,697 --> 00:11:44,034
Margot is a driven,
motivated, passionate woman

314
00:11:44,069 --> 00:11:48,405
with a cause in mind,
and her cause is revenge.

315
00:11:48,439 --> 00:11:51,541
This family has worked
too hard for too long

316
00:11:51,576 --> 00:11:55,212
to let anyone or anything get in its way.

317
00:11:55,247 --> 00:11:57,714
Katz: Margot's daughter,
Simone, has been raised

318
00:11:57,749 --> 00:12:01,718
with not only radical politics
and to believe in terrorism,

319
00:12:01,753 --> 00:12:03,653
but to obey her mother

320
00:12:03,688 --> 00:12:06,322
and do whatever her mother asks.

321
00:12:06,357 --> 00:12:08,291
Simone has a very strong set of beliefs

322
00:12:08,325 --> 00:12:09,693
that she's been brought up with.

323
00:12:09,727 --> 00:12:11,327
She would stop at nothing.

324
00:12:11,362 --> 00:12:12,929
She is ruthless, in a way,

325
00:12:12,963 --> 00:12:16,232
but I don't see her as,
in any way, a bad person.

326
00:12:16,267 --> 00:12:18,734
I think she just genuinely
does what she thinks is right.

327
00:12:18,769 --> 00:12:20,169
Simone: That man is trying to kill me!

328
00:12:20,204 --> 00:12:21,137
Help me! Help me!

329
00:12:21,171 --> 00:12:22,305
Man: Leave the girl alone!

330
00:12:22,339 --> 00:12:23,940
[Grunting]

331
00:12:23,974 --> 00:12:25,875
Sutherland: "24" really
is an ensemble show.

332
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:29,478
It can only be as good as... as
the cast that takes you there,

333
00:12:29,513 --> 00:12:32,080
and we couldn't have asked for better.

334
00:12:32,115 --> 00:12:35,918
Erik: I will shoot you in the
back of the head... I swear to God!

335
00:12:48,419 --> 00:12:50,820
There is something about the UK...

336
00:12:50,854 --> 00:12:52,956
in many ways, our relationship to the UK

337
00:12:52,990 --> 00:12:54,557
is so special and so deep

338
00:12:54,591 --> 00:12:55,825
that it felt like the right place.

339
00:12:55,859 --> 00:12:56,992
And it's iconic.

340
00:12:57,027 --> 00:12:58,694
Cassar: This is really
the first time we've taken

341
00:12:58,729 --> 00:13:00,730
the whole production to another
city, so it's very exciting,

342
00:13:00,764 --> 00:13:02,465
and I think we picked the right city.

343
00:13:02,499 --> 00:13:04,066
I just love this city.

344
00:13:04,100 --> 00:13:05,835
London's filled with history.

345
00:13:05,869 --> 00:13:07,236
The visuals speak for themselves.

346
00:13:07,270 --> 00:13:10,039
You can point the camera
almost anywhere, and it's great.

347
00:13:10,073 --> 00:13:12,774
Our first day, we were
right in central London,

348
00:13:12,809 --> 00:13:15,377
you know, right off of piccadilly circus.

349
00:13:15,412 --> 00:13:16,412
I was born here,

350
00:13:16,446 --> 00:13:17,746
and I was about 3,

351
00:13:17,780 --> 00:13:20,182
so there's a kind of a
nationalistic pride I have

352
00:13:20,216 --> 00:13:21,450
about England.

353
00:13:21,484 --> 00:13:24,386
Not only will it be exciting,
as it has been for me

354
00:13:24,421 --> 00:13:26,788
to work here as an actor and for our crew,

355
00:13:26,823 --> 00:13:31,326
I hope for the viewing audience,
it'll be like going on a trip.

356
00:13:31,360 --> 00:13:32,527
You know?

357
00:13:32,562 --> 00:13:34,896
We're gonna show you London
in a very different way.

358
00:13:34,931 --> 00:13:36,064
B-marker.

359
00:13:36,098 --> 00:13:38,433
Erik: Stop where you are!
Stop! Get on the ground!

360
00:13:39,234 --> 00:13:41,837
We shot right on the Thames.
We were just on the beach.

361
00:13:41,871 --> 00:13:44,238
And we had boats coming up
with guys with machine guys

362
00:13:44,273 --> 00:13:46,140
and guys coming down the wharf

363
00:13:46,175 --> 00:13:48,509
and another guy coming over down the beach,

364
00:13:48,543 --> 00:13:49,944
and so I was in the middle of kind of

365
00:13:49,979 --> 00:13:52,213
playing all of that action
and getting focused on that.

366
00:13:52,247 --> 00:13:53,547
Man: Cut! Excellent!

367
00:13:53,582 --> 00:13:54,882
And then I looked up,

368
00:13:54,916 --> 00:13:56,284
and you could clearly
see that it was London.

369
00:13:56,318 --> 00:13:57,986
Man: Eight camera, right
here. Exact same thing.

370
00:13:58,020 --> 00:13:59,820
One of the interesting
things about "24" was,

371
00:13:59,855 --> 00:14:01,254
even when we were in Los Angeles

372
00:14:01,289 --> 00:14:03,423
or in New York or Washington,

373
00:14:03,458 --> 00:14:06,927
it was never a show about
monuments and big buildings.

374
00:14:06,962 --> 00:14:08,328
It was always... it took place

375
00:14:08,363 --> 00:14:10,063
in the back streets and alleys,

376
00:14:10,098 --> 00:14:12,265
and... and that's also
applied here in London.

377
00:14:12,300 --> 00:14:13,333
Action.

378
00:14:13,368 --> 00:14:15,268
We shot in the back alleys.

379
00:14:15,303 --> 00:14:16,836
We were at a block-housing project.

380
00:14:16,871 --> 00:14:19,206
So, that's all part of "24," also,

381
00:14:19,240 --> 00:14:21,941
because people are hiding,
and people are undercover,

382
00:14:21,976 --> 00:14:23,610
and so you can't be always
right in the main streets

383
00:14:23,644 --> 00:14:24,611
with all the people.

384
00:14:24,645 --> 00:14:26,413
Man: I've got a confirm on the target.

385
00:14:26,447 --> 00:14:29,582
Hooded sweatshirt, 30
feet from the south wall.

386
00:14:29,617 --> 00:14:31,885
Man 2: And go, go, go!

387
00:14:31,919 --> 00:14:34,888
London has been very cooperative
about letting us shoot places.

388
00:14:34,922 --> 00:14:36,055
So, we shot on the tube,

389
00:14:36,089 --> 00:14:38,625
and we do some terrible things on the tube,

390
00:14:38,659 --> 00:14:42,094
but they would not let
anyone jump the fare barrier

391
00:14:42,129 --> 00:14:44,797
and... and... and get on for free.

392
00:14:44,832 --> 00:14:46,499
- That was the one restriction.
- One step too far.

393
00:14:46,534 --> 00:14:48,100
- Not having any of that.
- Yes. Yes.

394
00:14:50,470 --> 00:14:53,872
He's coming your way. He's probably armed.

395
00:14:53,907 --> 00:14:55,641
Cassar: We're doing,
you know, big shootouts,

396
00:14:55,675 --> 00:14:56,875
and right on day one,

397
00:14:56,910 --> 00:14:58,277
the armorers were showing us guns

398
00:14:58,311 --> 00:14:59,478
that I'd never even seen before.

399
00:14:59,513 --> 00:15:02,048
We've got quite a lot of
weaponry on this series,

400
00:15:02,082 --> 00:15:03,815
and we're gonna start with Jack's gun.

401
00:15:03,850 --> 00:15:05,717
We've updated it for this series of "24."

402
00:15:05,752 --> 00:15:08,086
He used to have a HK USP Compact.

403
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:10,789
We now have a HK P30.

404
00:15:10,823 --> 00:15:13,391
He also uses other agents' guns throughout,

405
00:15:13,426 --> 00:15:16,294
particularly the Glock 17,
which is our CIA weapon.

406
00:15:16,328 --> 00:15:21,099
We've also provided gun
cameras, which fit on the front,

407
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,301
give something visual for
the director to read off.

408
00:15:23,335 --> 00:15:26,438
Our different tactical agents,
when we see them in the field...

409
00:15:26,472 --> 00:15:28,940
they have a HK MP7.

410
00:15:28,974 --> 00:15:31,109
They also have an M4 derivative,

411
00:15:31,143 --> 00:15:32,243
and this is a bit of fun,

412
00:15:32,278 --> 00:15:36,581
which is a corner shot
9-millimeter Glock 17,

413
00:15:36,615 --> 00:15:39,249
but if I show you how it operates,

414
00:15:39,284 --> 00:15:40,952
it just comes up like that.

415
00:15:40,986 --> 00:15:43,420
Come back around...

416
00:15:43,455 --> 00:15:45,522
and you can fire around corners.

417
00:15:45,557 --> 00:15:47,925
Camera mounted on the
front with a monitor here.

418
00:15:47,960 --> 00:15:49,927
- Drop the weapon! Put it on the ground!
- Putting the weapon down!

419
00:15:49,962 --> 00:15:50,795
Get on the ground, Bauer!

420
00:15:50,829 --> 00:15:52,463
- [Gunshots]
- Aah!

421
00:15:55,100 --> 00:15:56,333
Here we go. Action!

422
00:15:56,367 --> 00:15:58,034
[Screams]

423
00:15:59,870 --> 00:16:01,472
My name's Mark Mottram.

424
00:16:01,506 --> 00:16:03,474
I'm the stunt coordinator on "24."

425
00:16:03,508 --> 00:16:04,541
Jon moves so quick.

426
00:16:04,576 --> 00:16:06,510
He knows where he's going, knows the shots.

427
00:16:06,544 --> 00:16:08,645
We just got to be on top
of everything, you know?

428
00:16:08,679 --> 00:16:09,846
And it's got to be ready.

429
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,281
If I'm holding him up,
he's kicking me up the butt.

430
00:16:11,316 --> 00:16:12,616
Do you know what I mean? So...

431
00:16:12,650 --> 00:16:14,283
Kiefer picks it up so quick.
Do you know what I mean?

432
00:16:14,318 --> 00:16:16,185
I mean [Scoffs] he's
done this a million times.

433
00:16:16,220 --> 00:16:17,687
It's like driving a car to him, you know?

434
00:16:17,722 --> 00:16:19,089
We literally set a few moves.

435
00:16:19,123 --> 00:16:21,190
He comes in, picks it up
like, you know, nothing,

436
00:16:21,225 --> 00:16:23,627
which is really quite cool, yeah.

437
00:16:23,661 --> 00:16:25,394
Mark and his team, I
think, are really good,

438
00:16:25,429 --> 00:16:26,997
and they really are a team.

439
00:16:27,798 --> 00:16:30,433
They're shooting at us! Move! Move!

440
00:16:30,467 --> 00:16:33,436
They've had a very busy
episode one and two.

441
00:16:33,470 --> 00:16:34,937
[Indistinct shouting]

442
00:16:34,971 --> 00:16:37,240
It was filled with fights and action,

443
00:16:37,274 --> 00:16:38,941
so they've hit the floor running,

444
00:16:38,975 --> 00:16:40,343
and... and the poor guys, I don't think,

445
00:16:40,377 --> 00:16:41,777
are gonna get much of a break.

446
00:16:41,811 --> 00:16:43,346
I think... I think
they're gonna be very busy

447
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:45,080
through the 12 episodes.

448
00:16:45,115 --> 00:16:47,783
3, 2, 1, action!

449
00:16:49,052 --> 00:16:50,052
Cut!

450
00:16:50,086 --> 00:16:51,120
Man: All right.

451
00:16:51,154 --> 00:16:52,788
The guys that do our special effects...

452
00:16:52,822 --> 00:16:55,423
they've been a crack crew.
It's very important for "24."

453
00:16:55,458 --> 00:16:58,127
We blow things up. It's
what we're known for.

454
00:16:58,161 --> 00:17:01,429
And so, coming to the UK
was not gonna change that.

455
00:17:01,464 --> 00:17:03,331
Bullet hits, things breaking,

456
00:17:03,366 --> 00:17:05,300
atmosphere, obviously, in all our sets,

457
00:17:05,334 --> 00:17:06,434
which is smoke and water.

458
00:17:06,469 --> 00:17:07,869
In the first two episodes,

459
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:10,104
we've already had, I think,

460
00:17:10,139 --> 00:17:12,006
probably over a dozen explosions.

461
00:17:16,212 --> 00:17:17,812
Man: Cut! That was awesome!

462
00:17:27,348 --> 00:17:29,182
[Indistinct shouting]

463
00:17:29,216 --> 00:17:33,619
Gordon: "24" sort of was
created in the context of 9/11,

464
00:17:33,654 --> 00:17:36,823
but Jack really has become, in some ways,

465
00:17:36,857 --> 00:17:39,759
the lightning rod and the litmus test

466
00:17:39,793 --> 00:17:43,329
for this very complicated
world we're living in.

467
00:17:43,363 --> 00:17:45,397
So I think, culturally,
he really came to be

468
00:17:45,432 --> 00:17:48,568
this reflection of what
we hoped a hero could be

469
00:17:48,602 --> 00:17:49,735
in these very complicated times.

470
00:17:49,770 --> 00:17:51,637
- We all wish
- They're shooting at us! Move!

471
00:17:51,672 --> 00:17:54,106
we knew a Jack Bauer, had
a Jack Bauer protecting us.

472
00:17:54,140 --> 00:17:55,741
He really is A pretty
classic American hero.

473
00:17:55,776 --> 00:17:57,509
Jack Bauer is the kind of character

474
00:17:57,543 --> 00:18:01,981
that has universal appeal in
that he is a man of principles.

475
00:18:02,015 --> 00:18:03,349
Come on, Mr. Bauer.

476
00:18:03,383 --> 00:18:05,217
His principles drive his every action.

477
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:06,218
Now or never.

478
00:18:06,252 --> 00:18:07,987
Katz: The character has taken on

479
00:18:08,021 --> 00:18:09,888
kind of a little bit of a mythic status,

480
00:18:09,922 --> 00:18:11,190
a little larger than life.

481
00:18:11,224 --> 00:18:14,058
There's a lot of speculation
about what's happened to him,

482
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,695
who he is after he fell off the deep end

483
00:18:16,729 --> 00:18:18,429
at the end of season eight.

484
00:18:18,464 --> 00:18:19,664
Kiefer's playing it

485
00:18:19,699 --> 00:18:22,066
with an incredible amount of intensity

486
00:18:22,101 --> 00:18:26,437
and need to succeed
and a need to be a hero.

487
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:28,907
The character is... it's like a kind of

488
00:18:28,941 --> 00:18:30,875
this fantastic long-lost friend, you know?

489
00:18:30,909 --> 00:18:33,111
And so we got to see each other again.

490
00:18:33,145 --> 00:18:37,548
Fox was very, very gutsy
to... to do a show like "24."

491
00:18:37,582 --> 00:18:40,518
Raver: "24," for me, was really a catalyst

492
00:18:40,552 --> 00:18:44,622
for how television was
viewed and is viewed.

493
00:18:44,656 --> 00:18:46,590
"24" was one of the sort of first,

494
00:18:46,625 --> 00:18:49,393
like, binge-watching of shows.

495
00:18:49,427 --> 00:18:53,664
Classic "24" kind of had
that addictive, you know...

496
00:18:53,698 --> 00:18:55,900
all the plots leading to
the end of that episode.

497
00:18:55,934 --> 00:18:57,668
You couldn't wait... you
know, the binge-watching.

498
00:18:57,702 --> 00:19:00,504
And now that's become the model,

499
00:19:00,539 --> 00:19:02,239
and we have so much great programming

500
00:19:02,273 --> 00:19:04,374
that came after that.

501
00:19:04,409 --> 00:19:07,144
Television, to me, is
the most exciting medium,

502
00:19:07,178 --> 00:19:08,311
and I'm telling you this

503
00:19:08,346 --> 00:19:09,746
<i>as an actor who does films and television.</i>

504
00:19:09,780 --> 00:19:11,814
For all of those reasons

505
00:19:11,849 --> 00:19:14,717
that television has become
as exciting as it is,

506
00:19:14,752 --> 00:19:18,888
"24" was one of the aspects
that helped shape that,

507
00:19:18,923 --> 00:19:20,757
and for that, I will always be proud.

508
00:19:20,791 --> 00:19:22,825
Cassar: We were fortunate to just be

509
00:19:22,860 --> 00:19:25,028
right at the leading edge of that wave.

510
00:19:25,062 --> 00:19:28,130
It was kind of a new age
of... of, you know, television.

511
00:19:28,165 --> 00:19:30,833
It was really exciting to
keep pushing the limits,

512
00:19:30,868 --> 00:19:33,069
and... and I don't think that's gonna stop.

513
00:19:33,103 --> 00:19:35,471
I mean, I think "24" is
still one of those shows,

514
00:19:35,505 --> 00:19:37,873
and... and even though we're
coming back after being,

515
00:19:37,907 --> 00:19:39,975
you know, after being laid off for a while,

516
00:19:40,009 --> 00:19:42,778
I think we're still gonna
be on that leading edge.

517
00:19:42,812 --> 00:19:45,347
Rajskub: What's cool, I think, about "24"

518
00:19:45,382 --> 00:19:47,583
is that it reflects the
issues that are going on today.

519
00:19:47,617 --> 00:19:50,219
Cassar: "24" was always
dealing with stories

520
00:19:50,253 --> 00:19:52,220
that were ripped right
out of the headlines,

521
00:19:52,254 --> 00:19:54,556
and so I think that's always
part of what we give you

522
00:19:54,591 --> 00:19:55,924
when... when we give you "24."

523
00:19:55,959 --> 00:19:59,127
Katz: Several things that
really have become bigger issues

524
00:19:59,161 --> 00:20:01,763
in the four years since
the show's been on...

525
00:20:01,798 --> 00:20:05,366
drone warfare, the advent of WikiLeaks,

526
00:20:05,401 --> 00:20:06,534
and hyper-government surveillance

527
00:20:06,569 --> 00:20:07,869
and people revealing that.

528
00:20:07,904 --> 00:20:11,706
It's thrilling that there are
so many story lines started

529
00:20:11,740 --> 00:20:15,210
and in gear right here in this first hour.

530
00:20:15,244 --> 00:20:16,811
It's just amazing.

531
00:20:16,845 --> 00:20:18,279
Certain facts have been covered up by us.

532
00:20:18,314 --> 00:20:19,581
I think, you know,

533
00:20:19,615 --> 00:20:21,749
most television would
like to be this relevant.

534
00:20:21,783 --> 00:20:24,252
You don't need to have
watched the show before

535
00:20:24,286 --> 00:20:25,953
to watch the show now.

536
00:20:25,988 --> 00:20:28,222
We're designing it so that you can just,

537
00:20:28,256 --> 00:20:30,524
you know, get on board the moving train.

538
00:20:30,558 --> 00:20:31,892
Cassar: It's very quick.

539
00:20:31,927 --> 00:20:33,393
- It gets your heart racing.
- Get down! Get down!

540
00:20:33,428 --> 00:20:36,230
It's been described as
a soap opera on crack.

541
00:20:36,264 --> 00:20:39,166
Sutherland: We shoot it
faster. It's more instinctive.

542
00:20:39,200 --> 00:20:40,467
It's just simply more exciting.

543
00:20:40,502 --> 00:20:42,869
Coto: It becomes an
edge-of-your-seat experience.

544
00:20:42,903 --> 00:20:46,206
This is gonna be so
satisfying to the fans of "24."

545
00:20:46,241 --> 00:20:47,341
The show's coming back,

546
00:20:47,375 --> 00:20:48,509
and there's nothing we can do to stop it.

547
00:20:48,543 --> 00:20:49,776
Hey!

548
00:20:52,747 --> 00:20:54,448
They want blood!

549
00:20:55,150 --> 00:20:56,150
Stop, stop.

550
00:20:56,184 --> 00:20:57,851
Jack: This is bigger than President Heller.

551
00:20:57,885 --> 00:20:59,352
They're planning a full-scale attack.

552
00:20:59,386 --> 00:21:00,654
[Projectile whistling]

553
00:21:01,889 --> 00:21:03,657
[Beeping]

554
