Let's get a pic of the kids
for our Loud Wall of Fame.

179
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:21,250
Oh, great idea!
Everyone, hold up your trophies!

180

- Yeah.
- Not sure I'll show up, but...

182
00:08:26,333 --> 00:08:28,750

Hey. Guys, wait for me.

186
00:08:35,416 --> 00:08:38,833
- Look, it's the Loud sisters!
- Nobody tosses a baton like that one.

187

She embalmed my Uncle Jack!

188
00:08:41,750 --> 00:08:43,833
I wish my family
was as talented as they are.

189
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:49,166
- [man] Selfie!
- [woman] Can I get an autograph?

190
00:08:49,791 --> 00:08:51,708
Enough loudness. Scoots out.

191
00:08:52,541 --> 00:08:55,375
Hey! You gotta pay
to ride this hog, sonny.

192
00:08:55,458 --> 00:08:59,500
Wait! Hey? Hey, guys?
I want to be in the photo.

[poignant music playing]

194
00:09:04,458 --> 00:09:07,083
Oh, you just must be
so proud of your girls.

Loser!

199
00:09:18,791 --> 00:09:23,041
- Guess! I'm gonna be in the newspaper!
- That lady wants to interview us on TV!

200
00:09:23,125 --> 00:09:25,000
- [Lori] Most "likes" ever.
- Me too.

201
00:09:25,083 --> 00:09:27,458
- [Dad] How cool is that?
- [sisters] Yeah!

202
00:09:28,083 --> 00:09:30,625

Name one thing that makes me special.

230
00:10:51,208 --> 00:10:54,750
How about three? You've read
every single <i>Ace Savvy</i> comic twice,

231
00:10:55,583 --> 00:10:58,458
you're the fifth-best junior magician
in Royal Woods,

232
00:10:59,083 --> 00:11:00,833
and that history report you wrote?

Anyone can do those things.

[sighs] Admit it, Clyde. I'm always going
to be stuck in my sisters' shadows.

237
00:11:14,458 --> 00:11:16,750
I know exactly what'll cheer you up.

238
00:11:17,666 --> 00:11:19,500
My homemade cream puffs!

239
00:11:19,583 --> 00:11:22,916

Too much cinnamon? Not enough cinnamon?

245
00:11:35,500 --> 00:11:38,458
Actually, the recipe doesn't call
for cinnamon but I can add it...

246

No, Clyde, it's the best!

everyone is good at something.

[Clyde]<i> Nice one, Clyde.
You just made it worse.</i>

251
00:11:52,208 --> 00:11:54,375
Well, I'm not that good at baking.

252
00:11:55,458 --> 00:11:57,291
Then how do you explain this?

253
00:11:59,083 --> 00:12:00,208
[Clyde] I'm just lucky.

254
00:12:00,791 --> 00:12:03,125
- Baking runs in my family.
- What do you mean?

<i>Remember when I took that trip
to France with my Nana Gayle?</i>

- Bonjour.

my great-great-Nana Collette,</i>

259
00:12:14,083 --> 00:12:16,375
<i>- who ran a crepe shop in Calais.</i>
- Bonjour.

260
00:12:16,458 --> 00:12:20,250
<i>And my great-great-great-great-great-Nana
Helene, who baked for French royal family.</i>

00:12:20,333 --> 00:12:21,875
<i>Enchanté.</i>

[Clyde] <i>When I got home,
Nana Gayle showed me their recipe books</i>

263

<i>and I made cream puffs.</i>

264
00:12:27,125 --> 00:12:29,333
<i>She said baking was in my genes,</i>

265
00:12:29,416 --> 00:12:32,375
<i>just like Nana May,
Nana Colette, and Nana Helene.</i>

266
00:12:33,541 --> 00:12:35,666
- [gasps]
- Sorry, was that confusing?

267
00:12:35,750 --> 00:12:37,291
- It was a lot of nanas.
- No!

268
00:12:37,375 --> 00:12:39,500
You just gave me an awesome idea!

269
00:12:39,583 --> 00:12:42,000

of the world are we from?

- Who spit toothpaste on my arm?
- Clyde's family's from France.

Well, my family is from right here
in Royal Woods, honey.

I'm not sure where my family is
from originally. Why?

512
00:24:14,625 --> 00:24:16,375
Oh, let's not pry, Angus.

513
00:24:16,458 --> 00:24:19,125
The family is only here on holiday.

514
00:24:19,208 --> 00:24:21,416
Yes, well, I do hope you enjoy your visit.

515
00:24:21,500 --> 00:24:23,958
You'll find lovely accommodations
in the village.

516
00:24:24,041 --> 00:24:27,166
Or they could stay here!
It's their family's castle after all.

517
00:24:27,250 --> 00:24:28,500
- You mean it?
- We can stay?

518
00:24:28,583 --> 00:24:29,750
[all cheering] Yes!

519
00:24:30,583 --> 00:24:33,250
What a marvelous idea.

520
00:24:33,333 --> 00:24:34,500
[cheering]

521
00:24:34,583 --> 00:24:37,875
- I've never been so excited.
- Can we call you Aunty Morag?

522
00:24:37,958 --> 00:24:40,958
- [gasps] Oi! Hands off the antiques.
- Oh!

523
00:24:42,791 --> 00:24:45,083
- Oh, my.
- It was like that already.

524
00:24:45,666 --> 00:24:47,625
- [crashing]
- [cat meows]

525
00:24:48,125 --> 00:24:49,458
[chuckles] That one's on me.

526
00:24:49,541 --> 00:24:53,166
Uh, Mr. Angus, sir,
what can you tell us about our ancestors?

527
00:24:53,250 --> 00:24:56,625
Oh! A grander clan
this land has never seen!

528
00:24:58,416 --> 00:25:00,166
- [Luna] Whoa!
- [Lola] No way!

529
00:25:00,250 --> 00:25:02,625
Am I experiencing double vision?

530
00:25:02,708 --> 00:25:04,583
It's old-timey us!

531
00:25:04,666 --> 00:25:06,625
When did we pose for this?

532
00:25:06,708 --> 00:25:10,375
[Lori] Ten girls and one boy.
Literally just like us.

533
00:25:10,458 --> 00:25:11,500
That's amazing.

534
00:25:11,583 --> 00:25:12,500
Yes!

535
00:25:12,583 --> 00:25:14,375
Yeah. How about that?

536
00:25:15,708 --> 00:25:18,625
Just a week. Only for a week.

537
00:25:18,708 --> 00:25:21,041
Would you fancy a look
at the rest of the castle?

538
00:25:21,125 --> 00:25:21,958
[all] Yes!

539
00:25:22,041 --> 00:25:24,791
[Luan] Last one to their room
is a Scotch egg. Get it?

540
00:25:24,875 --> 00:25:26,666
- [Leni] No, I don't.
- No touching!

541
00:25:26,750 --> 00:25:27,916
[screams]

542
00:25:28,000 --> 00:25:31,333
It's just impossible to find
good help these days.

543
00:25:31,416 --> 00:25:32,500
- [Luan] Woo-hoo!
- Oh!

544
00:25:32,583 --> 00:25:36,791
No roughhousing. Hey, you!
Hey, hands off the tapestries. Tapestries!

545
00:25:37,833 --> 00:25:41,958
So, let me guess.
The sisters were all special, right?

546
00:25:42,041 --> 00:25:44,708
Oh, aye! All were exceptional.

547
00:25:44,791 --> 00:25:48,875
Our loch has never seen anything
quite like the Loud lassies!

548
00:25:49,458 --> 00:25:50,458
Of course.

549
00:25:51,291 --> 00:25:52,583
But there was also...

550
00:25:52,666 --> 00:25:53,750
- Stinkin!
- Lincoln!

551
00:25:53,833 --> 00:25:55,541
- Come here.
- Hurry!

552
00:25:55,625 --> 00:25:57,625
- Chop, chop!
- Sorry, Angus, I gotta go.

553
00:25:57,708 --> 00:25:58,833
What? What is it?

554
00:25:58,916 --> 00:26:00,416
[Lori] You have to see this.

555
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:03,541
Wow! Look at this!

556
00:26:04,500 --> 00:26:06,250
We all get our own rooms!

557
00:26:06,333 --> 00:26:08,000
[sisters] Lincoln, come look.

558
00:26:08,083 --> 00:26:10,083
I can jam in peace.

559
00:26:10,958 --> 00:26:11,958
Cool.

560
00:26:12,375 --> 00:26:14,083
I can rest in peace.

561
00:26:14,166 --> 00:26:15,166
Spooky.

562
00:26:15,583 --> 00:26:16,583
Whoa!

563
00:26:16,625 --> 00:26:19,791
No more tea parties
ruined by Lana's burping.

564
00:26:19,875 --> 00:26:21,291
Wanna bet?

565
00:26:21,375 --> 00:26:23,375
- [belches loudly]
- [laughs]

566
00:26:23,458 --> 00:26:25,083
My room has a hot tub.

567
00:26:25,958 --> 00:26:27,291
Yeah, I noticed.

568
00:26:27,375 --> 00:26:28,625
Whoa!

569
00:26:29,416 --> 00:26:31,750
I've found my happy place.

570
00:26:31,833 --> 00:26:33,416
- [explosion]
- Boom-boom!

571
00:26:33,500 --> 00:26:35,416
Mine has a fashion runway!

572
00:26:35,500 --> 00:26:36,625
[Lincoln] Styling!

573
00:26:37,208 --> 00:26:40,000
- [mic feedback]
- Mine is big enough to be a comedy club.

574
00:26:40,083 --> 00:26:42,416
[laughs] We each have our own bathroom!

575
00:26:42,500 --> 00:26:43,500
[all] What?

576
00:26:43,541 --> 00:26:46,000
I'm gonna take like 100 leaks a day.

577
00:26:46,083 --> 00:26:47,625
- [toilet flushes]
- [screams]

578
00:26:48,166 --> 00:26:50,333
- Ah, there you are, lad.
- [Lily giggles]

579
00:26:51,083 --> 00:26:53,958
Before you were whisked away,
I tried to tell you

580
00:26:54,041 --> 00:26:58,083
that the most special
of all your ancestors was the duke.

581
00:26:58,166 --> 00:26:59,375
The duke?

582
00:26:59,458 --> 00:27:03,541
Aye. And don't you know,
you'll be staying in his room.

583
00:27:05,166 --> 00:27:06,166
[gasps]

584
00:27:08,375 --> 00:27:09,458
Whoa!

585
00:27:10,875 --> 00:27:15,041
Wait. The boy in the painting
was the duke?

586
00:27:15,125 --> 00:27:17,041
- Aye.
- Hang on.

587
00:27:17,125 --> 00:27:20,125
The boy in the painting
with the white hair was the duke?

588
00:27:20,208 --> 00:27:21,083
Aye.

589
00:27:21,166 --> 00:27:24,541
The boy in the painting
with the white hair that had ten sisters

590
00:27:24,625 --> 00:27:26,916
and looked just like me was the duke?

591
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,000
The one and only!

592
00:27:28,083 --> 00:27:30,583
He was the most special Loud
there ever was.

593
00:27:30,666 --> 00:27:31,708
Yes!

594
00:27:32,583 --> 00:27:35,250
[Angus] Far and wide people knew his name.

595
00:27:35,333 --> 00:27:38,916
His deeds were noble. His heart was stout!

596
00:27:39,000 --> 00:27:40,125
- Whoa!
- Whoa!

597
00:27:40,208 --> 00:27:41,833
Sweet digs, Stinkin.

598
00:27:41,916 --> 00:27:44,083
The boy was the duke!

599
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,333
Whatever tugs your tonsils, bro.

600
00:27:46,416 --> 00:27:49,041
Hey, Angus, what's the deal
with all the dragon stuff?

601
00:27:49,125 --> 00:27:51,125
Ah, so you noticed!

602
00:27:51,208 --> 00:27:53,916
If it's dragons you fancy,
there's something you should see.

603
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,625
- [Lana] Ha!
- [Angus] Come with me.

604
00:27:55,708 --> 00:27:56,708
[gasps]

605
00:27:57,666 --> 00:27:58,875
Whoa.

606
00:27:58,958 --> 00:28:02,000
[noble music playing]

607
00:28:03,791 --> 00:28:08,583
The reason why dragons are celebrated here
is that they are a part of our history.

608
00:28:08,666 --> 00:28:11,041
I knew it! Dragons are for reals.

609
00:28:11,125 --> 00:28:13,166
[imitates buzzer] Sounds like hooey to me!

610
00:28:13,250 --> 00:28:15,541
Oh, they're as real
as the tartan in my kilt.

611
00:28:16,083 --> 00:28:19,750
In fact, your ancestors
had their very own dragon.

612
00:28:19,833 --> 00:28:22,333
And when the family left, so did she.

613
00:28:26,708 --> 00:28:28,791
Whoa, a dragon cave!

614
00:28:28,875 --> 00:28:30,000
Keep dreaming.

615
00:28:30,083 --> 00:28:31,791
If it's proof you need,

616
00:28:31,875 --> 00:28:35,666
take a gander at what
your ancestors' dragon left behind.

617
00:28:36,500 --> 00:28:38,708
Whoa! Oh, man. I told you!

618
00:28:38,791 --> 00:28:40,291
This is wack-a-doodle!

619
00:28:40,375 --> 00:28:43,458
Miss Lynn, if you wouldn't mind
taking Miss Lily for a moment.

620
00:28:43,541 --> 00:28:44,375
[giggles]

621
00:28:44,458 --> 00:28:47,166
Just as we hoped
that someday Louds would return,

622
00:28:47,750 --> 00:28:50,125
we hoped a dragon would too.

623
00:28:50,625 --> 00:28:52,833
[gasps] It's hatched!

624
00:28:52,916 --> 00:28:55,083
You mean there's a dragon
on the loose in here?

625
00:28:55,166 --> 00:28:57,458
- Uh-oh.
- No sudden movements.

626
00:28:57,541 --> 00:29:00,250
Easy does it. Remain calm!

627
00:29:00,333 --> 00:29:01,250
[both] Angus!

628
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,125
Ah! Run for your lives!

629
00:29:03,208 --> 00:29:04,500
[shouting]

630
00:29:04,583 --> 00:29:06,375
[laughing]

631
00:29:07,333 --> 00:29:09,208
- Aw, so cute.
- Puppy dragon.

632
00:29:09,291 --> 00:29:11,208
Look at that little face.

633
00:29:11,291 --> 00:29:14,000
- [chuckles]
- We gotta name this little pup.

634
00:29:15,416 --> 00:29:16,666
Lela.

635
00:29:17,416 --> 00:29:19,166
[Lana] Her name is Lela.

636
00:29:19,250 --> 00:29:20,625
[Luan] I love her so much.

637
00:29:20,708 --> 00:29:21,833
She's so cute.

638
00:29:21,916 --> 00:29:24,666
Biologically improbable yet so adorable.

639
00:29:24,750 --> 00:29:26,291
Can we keep her?

640
00:29:26,375 --> 00:29:29,375
Okay. But I am not changing her diaper.

641
00:29:29,458 --> 00:29:30,875
- Yes!
- Thanks, Mom.

642
00:29:30,958 --> 00:29:33,166
[trumpet playing off-key]

643
00:29:33,250 --> 00:29:35,125
Dude, pick a key.

644
00:29:35,208 --> 00:29:36,458
[trumpet sputters]

645
00:29:36,541 --> 00:29:37,625
[trumpet clatters]

646
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:40,583
[noble music playing]

647
00:29:42,291 --> 00:29:44,375
Uh, what are you doing, honey?

648
00:29:44,458 --> 00:29:46,166
Duke-ing.

649
00:29:46,291 --> 00:29:47,583
Right in front of us?

650
00:29:47,666 --> 00:29:50,000
You know we have our own bathrooms now.

651
00:29:50,083 --> 00:29:51,875
[laughing]

652
00:29:51,958 --> 00:29:53,958
[regal music playing]

653
00:29:59,541 --> 00:30:00,541
Hmm?

654
00:30:02,875 --> 00:30:03,875
Hmm.

655
00:30:07,083 --> 00:30:08,208
[trumpet sputters]

656
00:30:08,291 --> 00:30:09,791
[all laughing]

657
00:30:09,875 --> 00:30:11,708
Nice toilet paper scarf.

658
00:30:11,791 --> 00:30:14,083
Seriously? Pantaloons this time of year?

659
00:30:14,166 --> 00:30:17,833
I think Lincoln's gone
a little panta-looney. Get it?

660
00:30:18,791 --> 00:30:20,291
[exclaims] What the what?

661
00:30:20,958 --> 00:30:23,291
At least someone knows royalty
when they see it.

662
00:30:23,375 --> 00:30:27,666
The rest of you might wanna get on board.
'Cause this Loud is about to rule.

663
00:30:28,250 --> 00:30:30,708
- Dinner is served.
- [Lincoln] I'm okay.

664
00:30:30,791 --> 00:30:33,208
- I cooked everything in the castle.
- Whoa!

665
00:30:33,291 --> 00:30:35,750
I ran out of garlic, so I used Gaelic.

666
00:30:35,833 --> 00:30:37,375
[laughs] Good one, Dad.

667
00:30:41,958 --> 00:30:44,166
- [all cheering]
- [Luan] I call the turkey!

668
00:30:44,250 --> 00:30:45,500
Save some for me.

669
00:30:45,583 --> 00:30:47,041
[Lana] Yay, burritos!

670
00:30:48,000 --> 00:30:49,666
This is all your doing.

671
00:30:49,750 --> 00:30:51,333
It was my pleasure.

672
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:52,708
[screams]

673
00:30:55,666 --> 00:30:56,666
What a day!

674
00:30:56,750 --> 00:30:59,083
The Louds are back and so is a dragon.

675
00:30:59,166 --> 00:31:00,833
[laughs gleefully]

676
00:31:01,416 --> 00:31:02,416
[Lily giggles]

677
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,666
Bawitotos.

678
00:31:06,750 --> 00:31:07,833
[sniffs]

679
00:31:07,916 --> 00:31:09,500
[whimpers]

680
00:31:10,833 --> 00:31:11,958
[coos]

681
00:31:15,083 --> 00:31:16,291
[giggles]

682
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,500
I'm so glad we did this.

683
00:31:18,583 --> 00:31:21,958
[in Scottish accent] Aye, m'lady.
What a happy clan we have.

684
00:31:22,500 --> 00:31:24,000
Thanks, Angus.

685
00:31:24,083 --> 00:31:25,750
- Mmm.
- [Lily] Bawitos.

686
00:31:25,833 --> 00:31:29,000
So, what's a guy got to do
to become the duke around here?

687
00:31:29,083 --> 00:31:29,916
Come again?

688
00:31:30,000 --> 00:31:33,333
I was thinking about it,
and the duke and I look alike,

689
00:31:33,416 --> 00:31:37,791
we both have ten sisters, white hair,
a turkey tail, we're the same height...

690
00:31:38,625 --> 00:31:39,833
Dragon.

691
00:31:40,791 --> 00:31:41,875

693
00:31:43,916 --> 00:31:45,500
Whoa!

694
00:31:45,583 --> 00:31:47,708
Holy moly, she grows fast.

695
00:31:47,791 --> 00:31:49,166
Big girl!

696
00:31:49,250 --> 00:31:50,291
[all laugh]

697
00:31:50,375 --> 00:31:54,666
So the way I see it,
A plus B equals me being the new duke!

698
00:31:54,750 --> 00:31:55,958
What do you think?

699
00:31:56,041 --> 00:31:59,041
Lincoln, I'm afraid
it's not that simple, lad.

700
00:31:59,125 --> 00:32:03,083
[sighs] Wisely spoken.
You should listen to Angus.

701
00:32:03,166 --> 00:32:06,166
One can only become the duke
by making life better

702
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:08,125
for the people and our village.

703
00:32:08,208 --> 00:32:09,750
I see.

704
00:32:09,833 --> 00:32:12,375
Help the town and become the duke.

705
00:32:13,208 --> 00:32:14,416
Piece of cake.

706
00:32:14,500 --> 00:32:17,000
Now, if you'll excuse me,
I've got work to do.

707
00:32:17,083 --> 00:32:20,416
'Cause tomorrow, I'm gonna duke
this town up! Oh, yeah!

708
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:25,083
You fool! Blathering on
to that featherbrained boy

709
00:32:25,166 --> 00:32:26,791
about becoming the duke!

710
00:32:26,875 --> 00:32:29,250
Oh, the people would love a new duke.

711
00:32:29,333 --> 00:32:32,208
[imitating Angus]
"Oh, the people would love a new duke.”

712
00:32:32,291 --> 00:32:34,958
[normal voice] I don't care a jot
about those peasants!

713
00:32:35,041 --> 00:32:38,666
They're not peasants, Morag.
They're our neighbors, friends.

714
00:32:38,750 --> 00:32:40,500
Enough with your twaddle!

715
00:32:40,583 --> 00:32:44,500
Thanks to you flapping your gob,
I'm stuck with these hooligans!

716
00:32:44,583 --> 00:32:47,875
Crashing through the crowded halls,
dodging girls like...

717
00:32:47,958 --> 00:32:51,083
- Ping pong balls?
- Just to reach the bathroom on time.

718
00:32:51,166 --> 00:32:52,750
[chuckles] That's rather catchy.

719
00:32:52,833 --> 00:32:54,875
Don't you get cheeky with me.

720
00:32:54,958 --> 00:32:58,958
My ancestors have cared
for this castle in peace and quiet

721
00:32:59,041 --> 00:33:01,250
ever since they drove away the...

722
00:33:01,333 --> 00:33:06,791
I mean, ever since the, you know,
the first Louds sailed away forever.

723
00:33:06,875 --> 00:33:11,958
Oh, I deserve better than
to be banished to your wretched hovel.

724
00:33:12,041 --> 00:33:13,666
It's only for a week.

725
00:33:14,666 --> 00:33:18,500
And you'll have oodles of quietness here
in my little castle.

726
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:21,791
Shall I give you the grand t... Oof.

727
00:33:21,875 --> 00:33:22,750
Oh.

728
00:33:22,833 --> 00:33:24,208
Good night, Morag.

729
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:27,916

730
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:32,166
[dreamy music playing]

731
00:33:37,041 --> 00:33:39,833
Castle spirits, hear my plea.

732
00:33:39,916 --> 00:33:42,958
I summon a Loud from my family.

733
00:33:43,041 --> 00:33:46,083
On mystic winds, across Scottish moors,

734
00:33:46,166 --> 00:33:49,750
send the girl
who once walked these floors.

- What time is it?
- It's late.

740
00:34:07,583 --> 00:34:09,500
I'm still parachute-lagged.

741
00:34:09,583 --> 00:34:12,041
What's this about, Luce? I need my sleep.

742
00:34:12,125 --> 00:34:16,458
My family from this world,
meet our family from another.

743
00:34:16,541 --> 00:34:18,375
Lucille Loud.

744
00:34:20,333 --> 00:34:21,708
Charmed, I'm sure.

745
00:34:21,791 --> 00:34:23,791

[grunting]

747
00:34:25,250 --> 00:34:26,750
O-M-Ghost!

748
00:34:26,833 --> 00:34:29,291
She's like a glow-in-the-dark Lucy.

749
00:34:29,375 --> 00:34:33,416
It's a pleasure to meet you,
and to be home after 400 years.

750
00:34:33,500 --> 00:34:36,083
[gasps] Dragons and ghosts?

751
00:34:36,666 --> 00:34:38,666
- This place has everything.
- Whoa.

752
00:34:38,750 --> 00:34:40,875
- She's literally floating.
- Whoa.

753
00:34:40,958 --> 00:34:43,416
- Love the see-through look.
- Wow!

754
00:34:44,125 --> 00:34:45,583
- Honey?
- What?

755
00:34:45,666 --> 00:34:48,291
We did take this trip to meet relatives.

756
00:34:48,375 --> 00:34:50,458
Yeah, but not creepy ghosty ones.

757
00:34:50,541 --> 00:34:52,250

761

- Good morning, Morag.
- Your athletic supporter, sir?

762
00:35:11,166 --> 00:35:12,791
Not mine. [laughs]

763

[groans]

764
00:35:14,666 --> 00:35:16,083
Dear Old Aggie,

765
00:35:16,166 --> 00:35:19,250
you so cleverly drove away
those royal ruffians

766
00:35:19,333 --> 00:35:20,958
to have peace and quiet.

767
00:35:21,041 --> 00:35:24,666
How pained you'd be to hear
new Louds have returned!

768
00:35:24,750 --> 00:35:27,375
Thank goodness it's only for a week.

769
00:35:27,958 --> 00:35:29,583
- I wanna ride her!
- My turn!

770
00:35:29,666 --> 00:35:31,625
Oh, you found it. Thanks, Morag.

771
00:35:32,458 --> 00:35:33,458
[Morag] Ow.

772
00:35:35,416 --> 00:35:38,458
Oh! Poor Aggie!
Look what those beasts did to you.

[screams]

774
00:35:45,166 --> 00:35:47,750

- Ah.

775
00:35:47,833 --> 00:35:48,958
Excellent.

776
00:35:49,041 --> 00:35:50,875
[humming]

777
00:35:51,583 --> 00:35:52,875
Is someone there?

778
00:35:52,958 --> 00:35:54,333
- I...

00:35:54,416 --> 00:35:55,833

782

Only for a week.

783
00:36:04,125 --> 00:36:05,500
[Angus] Good day, lad.

784
00:36:05,583 --> 00:36:08,166
You got that right.
I'm about to become the new duke!

to start polishing that crown.

Oh, how glorious. Loch Loud will have

your family to move here, eh?

Don't worry. I can fix everything.

1198
00:58:11,041 --> 00:58:13,416
I'm the duke, remember? Here, watch.

1199
00:58:13,500 --> 00:58:14,375
[grunts]

1200
00:58:14,458 --> 00:58:15,791
See? Good as new.

1201
00:58:17,083 --> 00:58:18,083
[chuckles]

1202
00:58:21,541 --> 00:58:22,875
- [crowd gasps]
- Oh, no!

1203
00:58:22,958 --> 00:58:24,958
It's okay. You still have the fish shop.

1204
00:58:25,041 --> 00:58:26,375
That's a relief.

1205
00:58:30,500 --> 00:58:32,625
- [shouting]
- [woman] How could you?

1206
00:58:32,708 --> 00:58:35,416
- We trusted you.
- I loved that chippie!

1207
00:58:35,500 --> 00:58:36,625
How dare he?

1208
00:58:36,708 --> 00:58:38,958
[crowd shouting indistinctly]

1209
00:58:41,541 --> 00:58:42,416
Lincoln!

1210
00:58:42,500 --> 00:58:44,500
[Lincoln sobbing]

1211
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,166
- What a mess.
- [Leni] It's a disaster.

1212
00:58:49,250 --> 00:58:51,875
- [Lana] This place is trashed.
- [Luna] Total bummer.

1213
00:58:51,958 --> 00:58:54,000
[laughing]

1214
00:58:56,375 --> 00:58:58,083
[grumbles]

1215
00:58:59,166 --> 00:59:01,333
[laughs]

1216
00:59:09,541 --> 00:59:11,541
[sighing]

1217
00:59:19,541 --> 00:59:21,791
Oh, don't be sad.

1218
00:59:21,875 --> 00:59:25,750
Lela did precisely what
she was asked to do.

1219
00:59:30,500 --> 00:59:31,500
That's it.

1220
00:59:31,916 --> 00:59:32,916
[swallows]

1221
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:38,375
Good girl! Morag needs you
to be big and strong.

1222
00:59:40,333 --> 00:59:42,916
- [roars]
- [chuckling]

1223
00:59:43,000 --> 00:59:45,375
[ominous music playing]

1224
00:59:45,458 --> 00:59:48,583
Even dukes have bad days, sire.

1225
00:59:48,666 --> 00:59:53,583
[Lincoln] Bad day? Try "worst day ever."
From the worst duke ever.

1226
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:54,583
[gasps]

1227
00:59:54,666 --> 00:59:57,208
It hurts me to hear you say such a thing.

1228
00:59:57,291 --> 00:59:59,958
The people need you now more than ever.

1229
01:00:00,041 --> 01:00:02,083
[sisters] Lincoln? Lincoln?

1230
01:00:02,166 --> 01:00:04,166
Hey, everyone! I found him!

1231
01:00:04,583 --> 01:00:06,625
- [Lori gasps]
- [all clamoring]

1232
01:00:06,708 --> 01:00:08,583
- Are you all right?
- How you doing, buddy?

1233
01:00:08,666 --> 01:00:12,500
- We were worried about you, honey.
- Yeah, you really bombed out there.

1234
01:00:12,583 --> 01:00:14,000
- Lola!
- Not funny.

1235
01:00:14,083 --> 01:00:15,250
Totally uncool, dude.

1236
01:00:15,333 --> 01:00:17,833
If you'll let me finish!

1237
01:00:17,916 --> 01:00:21,208
We all blow it sometimes.
[whispering] Even me.

1238
01:00:21,291 --> 01:00:23,750
We want you to know
that we talked about it,

1239
01:00:23,833 --> 01:00:26,375
and tomorrow,
we're gonna help you rebuild the town.

1240
01:00:26,958 --> 01:00:30,250
Really? Aw, you guys are the best.

1241
01:00:30,333 --> 01:00:33,166
Well, of course they are! They're Louds!

1242
01:00:33,250 --> 01:00:35,291
Do you think the people will forgive me?

1243
01:00:35,375 --> 01:00:38,958
If there's one thing about our people,
it's that they don't keep a grudge.

1244
01:00:39,041 --> 01:00:40,833
[villagers chanting outside]

1245
01:00:40,916 --> 01:00:44,625
Go home, Duke!
Go home, Duke! Go home, Duke!

1246
01:00:44,708 --> 01:00:47,083
- We've lost everything!
- Out with you!

1247
01:00:47,166 --> 01:00:48,250
Leave our loch!

1248
01:00:48,333 --> 01:00:50,083
They're just blowing off some steam.

1249
01:00:50,166 --> 01:00:53,125
- Oh, they'll come around.
- Just give 'em time, bro.

1250
01:00:54,458 --> 01:00:56,208
No, they're right.

1251
01:01:00,541 --> 01:01:02,875
Sire, no. I beg of you.

1252
01:01:04,208 --> 01:01:06,291
I don't deserve to be the duke.

1253
01:01:08,333 --> 01:01:09,875
Can we go home now?

1254
01:01:33,833 --> 01:01:36,250
Toodle pip. Bye-bye!

1255
01:01:36,333 --> 01:01:38,125
[laughs gleefully]

1256
01:01:38,208 --> 01:01:41,708
I wouldn't want this
to be seen by the wrong eyes.

1257
01:01:41,791 --> 01:01:43,250
[chuckles]

1258
01:01:43,333 --> 01:01:47,541
Now, dear Aggie,
it's time I fulfilled my destiny.

1259
01:01:59,916 --> 01:02:04,083
Gasp. It cannot be. Old Aggie betrayed us!

1260
01:02:08,083 --> 01:02:14,291
My dearest friends, thanks to you,
the Louds will be gone forevermore!

1261
01:02:14,375 --> 01:02:16,041
- [cheering]
- Great job!

1262
01:02:18,083 --> 01:02:20,375
Glad that's over. Back home we go.

1263
01:02:20,458 --> 01:02:22,750
Oh, sorry, almost forgot to mention.

1264
01:02:22,833 --> 01:02:25,708
Before the Louds skedaddled off,

1265
01:02:25,791 --> 01:02:29,166
they requested that I be crowned duchess!

1266
01:02:29,250 --> 01:02:30,791
I was like, "Me? What?"

1267
01:02:30,875 --> 01:02:33,958
They were like,
"Yeah, totally, you're the best.”

1268
01:02:34,041 --> 01:02:38,416
It was so embarrassing.
But how could I say no?

1269
01:02:38,500 --> 01:02:39,625
[crowd gasping]

1270
01:02:39,708 --> 01:02:43,250
So let's get on with it.
Trumpets, robe, adoration.

1271
01:02:43,333 --> 01:02:44,375
[fanfare playing]

1272
01:02:44,458 --> 01:02:45,833
Morag, this is not...

1273
01:02:45,916 --> 01:02:48,416
By the power vested in me,
blahddy blah blah,

1274
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:52,333
Angus dubs me the Duchess of Loch Loud!

1275
01:02:54,666 --> 01:02:56,208
You can't do this.

1276
01:02:56,291 --> 01:02:58,166
Silence, you ninny.

1277
01:03:04,916 --> 01:03:06,541
Oh, for argyle's sake.

1278
01:03:08,458 --> 01:03:10,583
[laughs menacingly]

1279
01:03:11,291 --> 01:03:14,916
[crowd chanting] Duchess!
Duchess! Duchess!

1280
01:03:15,000 --> 01:03:17,208
[fanfare playing]

1281
01:03:17,291 --> 01:03:19,125
No!

1282
01:03:19,208 --> 01:03:21,041
- [gasping]
- [trumpets sputter]

1283
01:03:21,125 --> 01:03:23,333
The Louds did no such thing.

1284
01:03:23,416 --> 01:03:26,250
I was there.
They never gave you the crown!

1285
01:03:26,333 --> 01:03:29,458
- [groans]
- Angus is as honest as the day is long.

1286
01:03:29,541 --> 01:03:31,250
Is it true, Morag?

1287
01:03:32,416 --> 01:03:34,750
You know what? I could lie.

1288
01:03:35,458 --> 01:03:36,875
But why bother?

1289
01:03:36,958 --> 01:03:39,333
Guilty as accused!

1290
01:03:39,416 --> 01:03:40,458
[crowd gasps]

1291
01:03:40,541 --> 01:03:44,291
Our people deserve better
than a liar and a thief!

1292
01:03:44,375 --> 01:03:47,041
We willnae stand for it! Imposter!

1293
01:03:47,958 --> 01:03:51,208
Very well.
I tried doing this the nice way.

1294
01:03:51,291 --> 01:03:54,250
Now I'll do it my way.

1295
01:03:56,750 --> 01:03:57,750
Huh?

1296
01:03:58,291 --> 01:03:59,916
[Lela roars]

1297
01:04:18,708 --> 01:04:21,000
We've been run out of lots
of malls before,

1298
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,625
but never a whole country.

1299
01:04:22,708 --> 01:04:25,375
I didn't get to say goodbye to Scott!

1300
01:04:25,458 --> 01:04:27,458
- [sobbing]
- Lela!

1301
01:04:27,541 --> 01:04:28,958
Or Lucille.

1302
01:04:29,625 --> 01:04:33,125
- Yo, Luce, looks like you'll get a chance.
- [Lucy] Gasp!

1303
01:04:33,875 --> 01:04:35,750
Cousins! Cousins!

1304
01:04:36,583 --> 01:04:37,583
Lucille.

1305
01:04:37,666 --> 01:04:39,625
I come with grave news.

1306
01:04:39,708 --> 01:04:40,875
The best kind.

1307
01:04:40,958 --> 01:04:42,333
Not this time, Lucy.

1308
01:04:42,416 --> 01:04:46,916
Morag has stolen the crown
from our family and made herself duchess.

1309
01:04:47,000 --> 01:04:47,833
- Rude!
- What?

1310
01:04:47,916 --> 01:04:48,916
That's nefarious.

1311
01:04:49,000 --> 01:04:50,166
She can't do that.

1312
01:04:50,250 --> 01:04:52,583
We knew Morag couldn't be trusted.

1313
01:04:53,166 --> 01:04:54,625
But I did trust her.

1314
01:04:54,708 --> 01:04:58,166
- [Lucille] I fear it gets worse.
- Of course it does.

1315
01:04:58,250 --> 01:05:01,916
Morag is using the dragon
to chase away the people of Loch Loud.

1316
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:03,333
- What?
- How?

1317
01:05:03,416 --> 01:05:08,958
With the ancient dragon stone.
It can turn a good dragon evil.

1318
01:05:09,625 --> 01:05:11,791
Wait. My dragon ride.

1319
01:05:11,875 --> 01:05:15,791
That's why I couldn't control Lela!
She was under Morag's power.

1320
01:05:15,875 --> 01:05:19,250
Translation, Morag wrecked
the village, not you.

1321
01:05:19,833 --> 01:05:21,625
It's still my fault.

1322
01:05:22,375 --> 01:05:26,125
I wanted to be the duke so badly,
I let Morag trick me.

1323
01:05:26,833 --> 01:05:29,166
Now those people will lose their homes.

1324
01:05:30,666 --> 01:05:32,750
I've gotta do something about this.

1325
01:05:33,750 --> 01:05:36,083
No, we all do.

1326
01:05:36,166 --> 01:05:38,208
You're always helping us.

1327
01:05:38,291 --> 01:05:40,500
This time, we're helping you.

1328
01:05:42,666 --> 01:05:46,083
[uplifting music playing]

1329
01:05:46,166 --> 01:05:47,791
[indistinct chatter]

1330
01:05:48,500 --> 01:05:49,833
[Angus] Careful now.

1331
01:05:50,833 --> 01:05:52,708
Hurry. Come on, this way.

1332
01:05:52,791 --> 01:05:54,916
- [Lincoln] Angus.
- Blow me bagpipes!

1333
01:05:55,000 --> 01:05:56,500
Sire! Sisters!

1334
01:05:56,583 --> 01:06:00,083
You're back! But I'm afraid
Morag is mad as a March hare!

1335
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:04,250
We know. We've got a plan
to get that scepter and save the village.

1336
01:06:08,708 --> 01:06:10,125
[Morag laughs]

1337
01:06:10,208 --> 01:06:14,875
I'd say day one as the duchess
has been a smashing success!

1338
01:06:14,958 --> 01:06:18,583
[sighs] Peace and quiet at last.

1339
01:06:20,250 --> 01:06:22,083
[Lincoln on PA] <i>Testing one, two, three.</i>

1340
01:06:22,166 --> 01:06:24,208
- What?
- <i>Let's start the show.</i>

1341
01:06:24,291 --> 01:06:25,541
The Louds!

1342
01:06:27,625 --> 01:06:31,500
- I don't ding-dang get it.
- A boat, a crown, a muscle-arm?

1343
01:06:31,583 --> 01:06:34,666
And a smiley-face poop?
What is Leni trying to tell us?

1344
01:06:34,750 --> 01:06:35,875
[Lily giggling]

1345
01:06:37,000 --> 01:06:38,416
Boat go bye-bye.

1346
01:06:39,083 --> 01:06:40,458
- [both scream]
- Kids!

1347
01:06:40,541 --> 01:06:42,708
- [Dad] Starboard!
- [Mom] What does that mean?

1348
01:06:42,791 --> 01:06:44,166
[Dad] I don't know!

1349
01:06:45,791 --> 01:06:47,041
[Lela growls]

1350
01:06:50,833 --> 01:06:53,041
I thought I was done with you!

1351
01:06:53,125 --> 01:06:56,750
Show yourselves,
you deplorable, knee-high plonkers.

1352
01:06:57,416 --> 01:06:59,125
- [cheers, applause]
- Ah!

1353
01:06:59,208 --> 01:07:00,041
Okay, girls!

1354
01:07:00,125 --> 01:07:03,708
Operation "Get The Scepter From Morag
And Save The Village Before It's Too Late

1355
01:07:03,791 --> 01:07:06,875
And Also Think Of A Shorter Name
For This Operation" is a go!

1356
01:07:06,958 --> 01:07:08,458
Luan, you're up.

1357
01:07:10,041 --> 01:07:14,791
<i>There once was a duchess named Morag
Whose hair smelled like a floor rag</i>

1358
01:07:15,708 --> 01:07:19,166
<i>When she stole the crown
Everyone frowned</i>

1359
01:07:19,250 --> 01:07:21,666
<i>'Cause now their ruler was a poo-bag</i>

1360
01:07:21,750 --> 01:07:22,791
[laughs]

1361
01:07:22,875 --> 01:07:24,916
Come on, feel the noise!

1362
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:28,333
[loud guitar distortion playing]

1363
01:07:28,416 --> 01:07:29,416
Fore!

1364
01:07:30,916 --> 01:07:32,041
Leni, go!

1365
01:07:35,875 --> 01:07:36,875
Yay!

1366
01:07:38,208 --> 01:07:39,791
Ah! My eyes!

1367
01:07:41,500 --> 01:07:43,791
That teeth whitening was worth it.

1368
01:07:43,875 --> 01:07:44,916
Oops. Sorry.

1369
01:07:45,000 --> 01:07:49,291
- Lucy, you know what to do.
- Morag, catch me if you can.

1370
01:07:54,500 --> 01:07:55,333
Gotcha.

1371
01:07:55,416 --> 01:07:57,958
I was almost a goner. Maybe next time.

1372
01:07:58,041 --> 01:07:59,458
Fire!

1373
01:08:01,208 --> 01:08:03,083
Angus! What is going on?

1374
01:08:03,166 --> 01:08:06,375
- My dear Louds, it's madness!
- Where are the kids?

1375
01:08:06,458 --> 01:08:09,458
Oh, you know, just battling
a fire-breathing dragon.

1376
01:08:09,541 --> 01:08:11,166
- This way.
- Wait! I'm not ready.

1377
01:08:13,000 --> 01:08:16,208
- [in Scottish accent] Now I'm ready.
- Blow me bagpipes!

1378
01:08:18,208 --> 01:08:20,416
That's it, Luce! Keep coming!

1379
01:08:20,500 --> 01:08:23,041
Here we go. It's my turn. I can do this.

1380
01:08:23,125 --> 01:08:24,291
[grunts]

1381
01:08:24,875 --> 01:08:26,375
Yes! I'm on the dragon.

1382
01:08:26,458 --> 01:08:28,250
Ah! I'm on the dragon!

1383
01:08:28,333 --> 01:08:29,750
Easy now.

1384
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:31,708
[exclaims]

1385
01:08:32,250 --> 01:08:33,083
Phew.

1386
01:08:33,166 --> 01:08:34,166
[gasps]

1387
01:08:34,708 --> 01:08:35,708
Fire!

1388
01:08:36,291 --> 01:08:37,458
[roaring]

1389
01:08:37,541 --> 01:08:38,916
- [grunts]
- [both scream]

1390
01:08:40,291 --> 01:08:42,916
- [gasps] You!
- I won't let you get away with this!

1391
01:08:43,000 --> 01:08:44,250
- Let go!
- Never.

1392
01:08:44,333 --> 01:08:46,000
- [Lincoln] You stole it.
- It's mine!

1393
01:08:46,083 --> 01:08:49,250
Lincoln needs our help.
We have to get the others.

1394
01:08:50,208 --> 01:08:51,708
[roaring]

1395
01:08:51,791 --> 01:08:54,041
I command you to let go!

1396
01:08:54,125 --> 01:08:57,000
Command?
Is that what this is all about? Power?

1397
01:08:57,083 --> 01:09:02,250
Ha! No, this crown will guarantee
no Louds ever bother me again!

1398
01:09:04,458 --> 01:09:07,000
[gasps] Hate to bother you, but...

1399
01:09:07,083 --> 01:09:08,291
[screaming]

1400
01:09:09,500 --> 01:09:10,583
[screams]

1401
01:09:11,125 --> 01:09:12,375
Ah! [grunts]

1402
01:09:15,958 --> 01:09:17,333
[Luna] Lincoln!

1403
01:09:17,416 --> 01:09:18,625
[Lola] We're coming!

1404
01:09:19,291 --> 01:09:20,958
- [gasps]
- Holy moly!

1405
01:09:21,958 --> 01:09:24,625
- Ah! There he is!
- [Mom] My baby!

1406
01:09:24,708 --> 01:09:26,833
[Luan] We're here, brother. Don't worry.

1407
01:09:27,541 --> 01:09:29,833
- [all scream]
- No, Lela!

1408
01:09:30,541 --> 01:09:33,541
[Morag cackles] Oh, you really bungled it.

1409
01:09:34,291 --> 01:09:38,208
You should have sailed away
while you had the chance!

1410
01:09:38,291 --> 01:09:39,416
[gasps, grunts]

1411
01:09:40,083 --> 01:09:44,083
Now prepare to be loud no more!

1412
01:09:44,166 --> 01:09:45,500
[whimpering]

1413
01:09:47,500 --> 01:09:48,541
Fire!

1414
01:09:49,166 --> 01:09:50,666
No!

1415
01:09:50,750 --> 01:09:52,041
Stop!

1416
01:09:55,541 --> 01:09:56,791
- [gasps]
- Lincoln!

1417
01:09:56,875 --> 01:10:00,208
You want the crown so bad?
Come and get it!

1418
01:10:00,291 --> 01:10:02,166
- Lincoln!
- Don't do this!

1419
01:10:02,250 --> 01:10:03,250
Lela.

1420
01:10:10,125 --> 01:10:12,458
- Lincoln!
- What do we do now?

1421
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:15,958
[Dad] Just don't panic. Don't panic!
Don't panic! Don't panic!

1422
01:10:16,625 --> 01:10:20,291
Oh, what a pity. Nowhere to run.

1423
01:10:20,375 --> 01:10:24,458
This isn't the way to get what you want.
Maybe you can tell everyone you're sorry.

1424
01:10:24,541 --> 01:10:26,125
Why, yes, I could...

1425
01:10:26,208 --> 01:10:28,250
if I were a hare-brained fool!

1426
01:10:28,333 --> 01:10:30,875
Now give me the crown!

1427
01:10:30,958 --> 01:10:31,958
[gasps]

1428
01:10:32,583 --> 01:10:33,833
Never, Morag.

1429
01:10:33,916 --> 01:10:35,708
It's "Duchess" to you.

1430
01:10:35,791 --> 01:10:39,666
You can have all the crowns in the world,
but you'll never be the duchess.

1431
01:10:40,333 --> 01:10:42,541
You will never be special!

1432
01:10:42,625 --> 01:10:45,750
Just plain, boring Lincoln Loud.

1433
01:10:45,833 --> 01:10:50,000
Always in your sisters' shadows,
just where you belong.

1434
01:10:51,875 --> 01:10:52,875
You're wrong.

1435
01:10:53,875 --> 01:10:57,333
I'm the fifth-best junior magician
in Royal Woods.

1436
01:10:57,416 --> 01:10:58,250
What?

1437
01:10:58,333 --> 01:11:00,125
What enchantment is this?

1438
01:11:01,333 --> 01:11:02,333
Enough!

1439
01:11:07,083 --> 01:11:08,750
No more tricks!

1440
01:11:10,625 --> 01:11:13,291
Except one! Presto!

1441
01:11:15,583 --> 01:11:19,625
Dragon, obliterate this ninny
and bring me the crown!

1442
01:11:21,125 --> 01:11:22,125
What?

1443
01:11:25,583 --> 01:11:26,416
Oh, dear.

1444
01:11:26,500 --> 01:11:28,208
[triumphant music playing]

1445
01:11:28,291 --> 01:11:30,166
Ta-da! Lela!

1446
01:11:31,458 --> 01:11:32,833
No!

1447
01:11:34,583 --> 01:11:35,583
[gasps]

1448
01:11:36,166 --> 01:11:38,375
Backup plan. [laughing]

1449
01:11:38,458 --> 01:11:41,666
We did it! Way to go, Lily! [laughs]

1450
01:11:41,750 --> 01:11:45,291
All I wanted was my peace and quiet.

1451
01:11:45,375 --> 01:11:48,625
- And I will have it! Give me the crown!
- Let go!

1452
01:11:50,666 --> 01:11:52,875
[all screaming]

1453
01:11:54,458 --> 01:11:56,625
Lincoln!

1454
01:11:57,750 --> 01:11:59,291
Gotcha, Lil!

1455
01:12:00,083 --> 01:12:01,083
[thump]

1456
01:12:01,625 --> 01:12:02,625
Wait. What?

1457
01:12:03,291 --> 01:12:06,666
[triumphant music soaring]

1458
01:12:06,750 --> 01:12:07,583
Lela!

1459
01:12:07,666 --> 01:12:08,708
Good girl.

1460
01:12:12,000 --> 01:12:13,000
Slow down, Rita!

1461
01:12:15,208 --> 01:12:16,625
- Careful, sweetie.
- Ow!

1462
01:12:17,875 --> 01:12:18,875
[gasps]

1463
01:12:19,708 --> 01:12:21,625
Lily flying dragon!

1464
01:12:22,416 --> 01:12:24,125
- [cheering]
- [giggling]

1465
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,500
Let me go, you horrid beast!

1466
01:12:29,791 --> 01:12:32,125
- That was awesome!
- Way to go, Linc and Lily!

1467
01:12:33,000 --> 01:12:34,375
My babies!

1468
01:12:34,958 --> 01:12:37,208
Oh, Lela, we can't thank you enough.

1469
01:12:37,875 --> 01:12:39,375
Way to go, Lincoln.

1470
01:12:39,458 --> 01:12:40,666
We love you, Lela.

1471
01:12:40,750 --> 01:12:42,125
Who's a good dragon?

1472
01:12:42,208 --> 01:12:45,333
To the Louds! For saving our home!

1473
01:12:45,416 --> 01:12:51,041
To Lincoln, whom history will remember
as the loudest of the Louds!

1474
01:12:51,125 --> 01:12:53,416
[all cheering]

1475
01:12:53,500 --> 01:12:55,541
I'm sorry we doubted you.

1476
01:12:56,208 --> 01:12:57,208
[growls]

1477
01:12:59,458 --> 01:13:03,416
Duke Loud hoo! Duke Loud ha!
Duke Loud ho, ho, ho!

1478
01:13:04,333 --> 01:13:06,458
Our duke is back!

1479
01:13:06,541 --> 01:13:08,291
[all cheering]

1480
01:13:13,541 --> 01:13:16,541
What you waiting for, Linc?
Put that baby on.

1481
01:13:16,625 --> 01:13:18,791
If you don't, I will.

1482
01:13:21,250 --> 01:13:25,166
Ever since we came here,
I wanted this crown more than anything.

1483
01:13:25,250 --> 01:13:28,958
I thought if I had it,
I'd finally be special like my sisters.

1484
01:13:29,750 --> 01:13:30,833
When I wore it,

1485
01:13:30,916 --> 01:13:33,125
all I cared about
was what it would do for me,

1486
01:13:33,208 --> 01:13:35,083
not what I could do for you.

1487
01:13:35,666 --> 01:13:37,750
I'm sorry for being selfish.

1488
01:13:38,666 --> 01:13:39,500
The thing is,

1489
01:13:39,583 --> 01:13:42,750
someone kept trying to tell me
what it really means to wear the crown,

1490
01:13:42,833 --> 01:13:44,208
but I wouldn't listen.

1491
01:13:44,833 --> 01:13:46,208
I'm sorry for that too.

1492
01:13:48,541 --> 01:13:51,958
That's why there's only one person
who deserves to wear this crown.

1493
01:13:52,750 --> 01:13:56,666
- Angus, with the power vested in me...
- Lad, no.

1494
01:13:56,750 --> 01:13:58,875
- By the royal Loud family...
- I can't.

1495
01:13:58,958 --> 01:14:02,083
I dub thee the Duke of Loch Loud!

1496
01:14:02,166 --> 01:14:05,250
No, no, I'm just a simple groundskeeper.

1497
01:14:05,333 --> 01:14:08,666
- Oh, you're so much more.
- You're like family.

1498
01:14:08,750 --> 01:14:10,375
You've always been there for us.

1499
01:14:12,208 --> 01:14:14,375
[boy] The people have spoken, Angus.

1500
01:14:14,458 --> 01:14:16,291
- [gasping]
- The duke!

1501
01:14:16,375 --> 01:14:19,625
[warm music playing]

1502
01:14:19,708 --> 01:14:21,750
- Astonishing.
- It's our family.

1503
01:14:21,833 --> 01:14:23,416
Yo, cuz!

1504
01:14:23,500 --> 01:14:27,125
Twelve more ghosts. [laughs]
That's fine. I'm totally fi...

1505
01:14:28,791 --> 01:14:31,750
A more worthy duke
I've never laid eyes upon.

1506
01:14:31,833 --> 01:14:35,375
For you are the true caretaker
of our home and us all.

1507
01:14:35,458 --> 01:14:37,541
Thank you, Your Dukeship.

1508
01:14:42,916 --> 01:14:45,333
Well, blow my bagpipes.

1509
01:14:45,416 --> 01:14:47,416
- [cheering]
- [roars]

1510
01:14:48,583 --> 01:14:49,666
[coughs] Oh!

1511
01:14:50,291 --> 01:14:53,500
- So, Duke, what about me fish shop?
- What about my chip shop?

1512
01:14:53,583 --> 01:14:54,666
What about her?

1513
01:14:55,750 --> 01:14:56,750
Oh, dear.

1514
01:14:57,916 --> 01:14:59,666
Unhand me, beast!

1515
01:14:59,750 --> 01:15:02,500
The dragon is the true guardian
of the loch.

1516
01:15:02,583 --> 01:15:04,458
She shall decide Morag's fate.

1517
01:15:06,166 --> 01:15:07,333
[laughs]

1518
01:15:07,416 --> 01:15:10,666
The joke's on you,
you scaly, putrid lummox!

1519
01:15:10,750 --> 01:15:13,333
You gave me my peace and quiet.

1520
01:15:13,416 --> 01:15:15,041
[seals barking]

1521
01:15:15,125 --> 01:15:17,083
What? No. No!

1522
01:15:17,166 --> 01:15:20,416
No!

1523
01:15:21,500 --> 01:15:25,708
Lincoln, you giving the crown
to Angus was the coolest!

1524
01:15:25,791 --> 01:15:27,958
You're a good dude, dude.

1525
01:15:28,041 --> 01:15:29,125
Yes!

1526
01:15:29,208 --> 01:15:32,166
But all that stuff
about you not feeling special...

1527
01:15:32,250 --> 01:15:33,291
What was that?

1528
01:15:34,958 --> 01:15:36,083
[sighs]

1529
01:15:36,166 --> 01:15:38,375
You're all so good at everything.

1530
01:15:38,458 --> 01:15:41,583
You win trophies,
get your pictures taken, and...

1531
01:15:41,666 --> 01:15:43,583
I wanted to be special too.

1532
01:15:43,666 --> 01:15:46,333
Lincoln, you <i>are</i> special.

1533
01:15:46,416 --> 01:15:47,291
I am?

1534
01:15:47,375 --> 01:15:50,833
Yeah. Just like how Angus
takes care of everyone in Loch Loud.

1535
01:15:50,916 --> 01:15:52,875
You take care of us.

1536
01:15:52,958 --> 01:15:54,250
Every day, bro.

1537
01:15:54,333 --> 01:15:55,625
For reals.

1538
01:15:55,708 --> 01:15:58,625
That's why you're
the most special brother ever.

1539
01:15:58,708 --> 01:16:00,375
- Literally.
