1
00:00:14,095 --> 00:00:16,845
(dramatic music)

2
00:00:41,761 --> 00:00:45,344
(dramatic music continues)

3
00:00:57,971 --> 00:01:00,554
(gentle music)

4
00:01:32,978 --> 00:01:36,478
(gentle music continues)

5
00:01:51,081 --> 00:01:53,831
(dramatic music)

6
00:02:10,578 --> 00:02:14,161
(dramatic music continues)

7
00:02:46,091 --> 00:02:48,841
(birds chirping)

8
00:02:50,041 --> 00:02:51,208
- Who are you?

9
00:02:59,411 --> 00:03:00,244
- Coffee.

10
00:03:05,795 --> 00:03:06,628
- God.

11
00:03:07,477 --> 00:03:10,710
- I waited till left the driveway.

12
00:03:10,710 --> 00:03:12,750
Oh, you didn't get any sleep, did you?

13
00:03:12,750 --> 00:03:13,583
- No.

14
00:03:13,583 --> 00:03:14,587
- Same dream?

15
00:03:14,587 --> 00:03:15,420
- Mm-hmm.

16
00:03:15,420 --> 00:03:17,580
I wish I could describe it to you, Min.

17
00:03:17,580 --> 00:03:18,600
It's always so sweet

18
00:03:18,600 --> 00:03:20,400
and there's somebody there,

19
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,700
and then I'm so frightened at the end.

20
00:03:23,700 --> 00:03:24,533
- Of what?

21
00:03:24,533 --> 00:03:26,400
- I don't know.

22
00:03:26,400 --> 00:03:27,990
- Well, come on, get dressed,

23
00:03:27,990 --> 00:03:29,190
you gotta help me find an outfit

24
00:03:29,190 --> 00:03:30,380
for this museum benefit.

25
00:03:30,380 --> 00:03:31,213
- Okay.

26
00:03:31,213 --> 00:03:32,046
But I have to be back by three,

27
00:03:32,046 --> 00:03:33,508
'cause Daniel gets home
around (indistinct).

28
00:03:33,508 --> 00:03:35,505
- Moira, why do you put up with this shit?

29
00:03:35,505 --> 00:03:37,650
I can personally introduce you to three

30
00:03:37,650 --> 00:03:39,415
of the best divorce attorneys in town.

31
00:03:39,415 --> 00:03:40,590
They'll guarantee that you walk away

32
00:03:40,590 --> 00:03:41,423
with most of the money,

33
00:03:41,423 --> 00:03:42,570
and half the property.

34
00:03:42,570 --> 00:03:44,481
- It's not about money
and property with Daniel.

35
00:03:44,481 --> 00:03:46,983
You don't just walk away from him.

36
00:03:48,060 --> 00:03:49,950
He hates to lose.

37
00:03:49,950 --> 00:03:51,960
- So he hates to lose, they all do.

38
00:03:51,960 --> 00:03:52,793
You deserve better than this,

39
00:03:52,793 --> 00:03:54,123
I wish you knew that.

40
00:03:54,990 --> 00:03:57,780
- Min, you don't know him like I do.

41
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,100
- Thank God for that.

42
00:03:59,100 --> 00:03:59,933
Come on.

43
00:04:02,010 --> 00:04:02,970
- [Moira] It's getting awfully late, Min,

44
00:04:02,970 --> 00:04:03,803
what are we doing here?

45
00:04:03,803 --> 00:04:05,310
- [Mindy] This is the last stop.

46
00:04:05,310 --> 00:04:06,143
- [Moira] Uh-oh, what?

47
00:04:06,143 --> 00:04:07,444
- [Mindy] Promisee you won't scream?

48
00:04:07,444 --> 00:04:08,828
- [Moira] Okay, why?

49
00:04:08,828 --> 00:04:10,290
- [Mindy] I'm getting my cards read.

50
00:04:10,290 --> 00:04:12,660
- [Moira] Oh Mindy, please.

51
00:04:12,660 --> 00:04:14,986
- First the past.

52
00:04:14,986 --> 00:04:18,164
The empress, upside down.

53
00:04:18,164 --> 00:04:21,990
That probably has to do with
your marital difficulties.

54
00:04:21,990 --> 00:04:24,420
You just had a set back.

55
00:04:24,420 --> 00:04:25,713
- Told you she was good.

56
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,220
- Second, present.

57
00:04:29,220 --> 00:04:30,920
Ooh, the lover.

58
00:04:30,920 --> 00:04:32,493
- I like that.

59
00:04:35,459 --> 00:04:38,580
(dramatic music)

60
00:04:38,580 --> 00:04:40,080
What?

61
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:43,203
- I'm sorry, I'm getting
this incredible distraction.

62
00:04:44,163 --> 00:04:46,913
(dramatic music)

63
00:04:51,051 --> 00:04:53,790
- I'm gonna wait in the car.

64
00:04:53,790 --> 00:04:55,443
- Someone is looking for you,

65
00:04:57,233 --> 00:05:01,170
but there's a dark
presence keeping you apart,

66
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,670
and it frightens you.

67
00:05:02,670 --> 00:05:04,410
- Stop it, please.

68
00:05:04,410 --> 00:05:06,287
- You can't keep running from it.

69
00:05:06,287 --> 00:05:08,340
- I said stop it.

70
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,273
- Moira.

71
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:13,350
(dramatic music)

72
00:05:14,580 --> 00:05:15,993
What are you so upset about?

73
00:05:16,890 --> 00:05:18,813
She told you about the dream did she?

74
00:05:19,860 --> 00:05:21,638
- What did you tell her about me, Mind,

75
00:05:21,638 --> 00:05:24,060
that I had insomnia, nightmares, what?

76
00:05:24,060 --> 00:05:24,893
- No.

77
00:05:24,893 --> 00:05:27,063
I didn't even mention you, I swear.

78
00:05:28,380 --> 00:05:30,194
Look, here's her card, okay.

79
00:05:30,194 --> 00:05:32,433
She said to call her if you need anything.

80
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:34,853
- Can we go now?

81
00:05:34,853 --> 00:05:35,686
- Yes.

82
00:05:37,776 --> 00:05:40,526
(dramatic music)

83
00:05:44,629 --> 00:05:47,971
(car engine revving)

84
00:05:47,971 --> 00:05:50,721
(dramatic music)

85
00:06:17,923 --> 00:06:19,209
- Turn around.

86
00:06:19,209 --> 00:06:20,301
- (indistinct)

87
00:06:20,301 --> 00:06:22,301
- Shh, just turn around.

88
00:06:28,050 --> 00:06:30,590
Just be quiet, don't make much noise.

89
00:06:31,792 --> 00:06:34,625
(Beverly moaning)

90
00:06:41,729 --> 00:06:45,335
(Mindy and Moira laughing)

91
00:06:45,335 --> 00:06:46,652
- Call me.

92
00:06:46,652 --> 00:06:49,485
(Beverly moaning)

93
00:06:55,069 --> 00:06:55,902
- Bye Min.

94
00:07:03,223 --> 00:07:06,467
(car horn honking)

95
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:08,118
(Beverly moaning)

96
00:07:08,118 --> 00:07:10,868
(dramatic music)

97
00:07:27,117 --> 00:07:29,950
(Beverly moaning)

98
00:07:30,789 --> 00:07:33,539
(dramatic music)

99
00:07:41,953 --> 00:07:44,786
(Beverly moaning)

100
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:55,669
- Just lay down here.

101
00:08:01,740 --> 00:08:02,573
- Harder.

102
00:08:03,848 --> 00:08:06,598
(dramatic music)

103
00:08:08,381 --> 00:08:11,214
(Beverly moaning)

104
00:08:12,552 --> 00:08:13,385
- Shh.

105
00:08:15,049 --> 00:08:18,432
(Beverly moaning)

106
00:08:18,432 --> 00:08:20,349
- You're so disgusting.

107
00:08:23,466 --> 00:08:25,006
(Beverly moaning)

108
00:08:25,006 --> 00:08:25,839
- Shh.

109
00:08:38,429 --> 00:08:39,372
- I gotta go.

110
00:08:39,372 --> 00:08:40,205
- No.

111
00:08:40,205 --> 00:08:41,163
- I gotta go.

112
00:08:41,163 --> 00:08:42,824
I gotta go.

113
00:08:42,824 --> 00:08:45,574
(dramatic music)

114
00:08:52,711 --> 00:08:55,378
(bird chirping)

115
00:08:59,534 --> 00:09:00,367
Moira.

116
00:09:01,628 --> 00:09:03,124
- What is it, Daniel?

117
00:09:03,124 --> 00:09:04,320
- Honey, could you
please put some coffee on

118
00:09:04,320 --> 00:09:05,570
for Miss Keen and myself?

119
00:09:07,847 --> 00:09:10,593
- You want me to make
coffee for your secretary?

120
00:09:10,593 --> 00:09:13,440
- I want you to make
coffee for anyone I ask.

121
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,405
My secretary takes care
of my business affairs,

122
00:09:15,405 --> 00:09:17,552
you take care of the house.

123
00:09:17,552 --> 00:09:19,833
You'll serve coffee to
the gardener if I ask.

124
00:09:22,214 --> 00:09:24,797
(gentle music)

125
00:09:39,990 --> 00:09:41,190
Moira,

126
00:09:41,190 --> 00:09:42,940
would you please bring me a cognac?

127
00:09:59,610 --> 00:10:01,020
- Here you are dear.

128
00:10:01,020 --> 00:10:01,860
- Thanks.

129
00:10:01,860 --> 00:10:02,693
Please, sit.

130
00:10:03,718 --> 00:10:04,794
- Okay.

131
00:10:04,794 --> 00:10:06,163
- How was your day today?

132
00:10:06,163 --> 00:10:07,197
- Fine.

133
00:10:07,197 --> 00:10:08,947
Did a little shopping with Melinda.

134
00:10:10,020 --> 00:10:12,000
- Did you buy something nice?

135
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:14,370
- I found something I think you'll like.

136
00:10:14,370 --> 00:10:15,510
- Well that's good, you can wear it

137
00:10:15,510 --> 00:10:17,640
to Councilman Roger's party next week.

138
00:10:17,640 --> 00:10:18,894
- Fine.

139
00:10:18,894 --> 00:10:21,690
- I want to apologize about today.

140
00:10:21,690 --> 00:10:24,210
I realize I haven't spent
much time with you lately,

141
00:10:24,210 --> 00:10:26,250
and I understand your jealousy

142
00:10:26,250 --> 00:10:29,100
towards all the time I've had
to spend with my secretary.

143
00:10:31,020 --> 00:10:33,573
So your little emotional
outburst is forgiven.

144
00:10:35,910 --> 00:10:36,743
Come here.

145
00:10:37,626 --> 00:10:39,497
(dramatic music)

146
00:10:39,497 --> 00:10:40,513
Come here.

147
00:10:40,513 --> 00:10:44,096
(dramatic music continues)

148
00:10:51,232 --> 00:10:53,815
(gentle music)

149
00:11:00,411 --> 00:11:03,828
(gentle music continues)

150
00:11:29,463 --> 00:11:32,880
(gentle music continues)

151
00:12:05,668 --> 00:12:09,085
(gentle music continues)

152
00:12:34,899 --> 00:12:37,466
(thunder booming)

153
00:12:37,466 --> 00:12:40,216
(dramatic music)

154
00:12:53,632 --> 00:12:57,215
(dramatic music continues)

155
00:13:48,603 --> 00:13:50,740
(phone ringing)

156
00:13:50,740 --> 00:13:52,860
- Don't you dare.

157
00:13:52,860 --> 00:13:53,853
- I gotta get it.

158
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:56,010
Hello.

159
00:13:56,010 --> 00:13:58,203
- Reed, can you talk?

160
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:01,140
- I'm a little busy right
now, if you catch my drift.

161
00:14:01,140 --> 00:14:03,090
- I can't believe you answered the phone.

162
00:14:03,090 --> 00:14:03,940
- I'm sorry, man.

163
00:14:05,130 --> 00:14:06,150
I'll call you tomorrow.

164
00:14:06,150 --> 00:14:06,983
- Okay, bye.

165
00:14:07,830 --> 00:14:08,910
It's always something with that guy.

166
00:14:08,910 --> 00:14:09,930
- You're so insensitive.

167
00:14:09,930 --> 00:14:11,248
- Oh come on, Gina,

168
00:14:11,248 --> 00:14:12,180
where were we?

169
00:14:12,180 --> 00:14:13,397
- Gina?

170
00:14:13,397 --> 00:14:15,033
I don't think so.

171
00:14:17,250 --> 00:14:18,083
- Suzie?

172
00:14:56,220 --> 00:14:58,260
- There's no way I could have
been undercut on that deal.

173
00:14:58,260 --> 00:14:59,752
I want that property.

174
00:14:59,752 --> 00:15:03,460
Now if someone in my organization
is leaking information

175
00:15:04,330 --> 00:15:05,742
I wanna know who

176
00:15:05,742 --> 00:15:07,492
and I wanna know now.

177
00:15:12,482 --> 00:15:14,173
(glass shattering)

178
00:15:14,173 --> 00:15:17,043
I can't believe it, I lost
the Philadelphia deal.

179
00:15:18,600 --> 00:15:19,433
- I'm sorry.

180
00:15:26,400 --> 00:15:28,113
- My coffee is cold.

181
00:15:29,190 --> 00:15:30,270
- I'll make some more.

182
00:15:30,270 --> 00:15:31,113
- With what?

183
00:15:33,921 --> 00:15:35,833
I'll get some on the way to the office.

184
00:15:35,833 --> 00:15:38,416
(gentle music)

185
00:15:59,610 --> 00:16:02,470
- Please help me, I'm
going out of my mind.

186
00:16:15,603 --> 00:16:18,520
(knocking on door)

187
00:16:21,246 --> 00:16:23,079
- Yeah, just a minute.

188
00:16:25,328 --> 00:16:28,245
(knocking on door)

189
00:16:29,490 --> 00:16:30,966
Yeah, who is it?

190
00:16:30,966 --> 00:16:32,910
- Jesus, Nick, I've been
knocking for 10 minutes,

191
00:16:32,910 --> 00:16:34,370
I thought you were in
the shower or something.

192
00:16:34,370 --> 00:16:35,283
- Be right down.

193
00:16:38,310 --> 00:16:40,080
- Jesus, you look like shit.

194
00:16:40,080 --> 00:16:40,913
- Thanks.

195
00:16:40,913 --> 00:16:41,853
- What, did you party too much last night?

196
00:16:41,853 --> 00:16:43,410
- Nah, I just couldn't sleep.

197
00:16:43,410 --> 00:16:44,660
- Well take something,
man, 'cause you're starting

198
00:16:44,660 --> 00:16:46,620
to look like the walking dead.

199
00:16:46,620 --> 00:16:48,300
- It's not like insomnia or anything,

200
00:16:48,300 --> 00:16:51,483
I mean I sleep, I just have these dreams.

201
00:16:51,483 --> 00:16:53,340
- I tell you it's that spicy Thai food,

202
00:16:53,340 --> 00:16:54,672
after 11:00 it'll kill you.

203
00:16:54,672 --> 00:16:56,156
Go wash your face.

204
00:16:56,156 --> 00:16:57,960
Hey, I left the key in your mailbox

205
00:16:57,960 --> 00:16:59,160
for that job off Ocean Park,

206
00:16:59,160 --> 00:17:00,300
did you find it?

207
00:17:00,300 --> 00:17:01,800
- Yeah, yeah, I got it somewhere.

208
00:17:01,800 --> 00:17:03,707
I checked out the house, it's not too bad.

209
00:17:03,707 --> 00:17:05,853
- I told the agent you'd call her today.

210
00:17:06,720 --> 00:17:09,420
If it was just a fix up I'd do it myself.

211
00:17:09,420 --> 00:17:10,700
The real estate lady
says she wants the house

212
00:17:10,700 --> 00:17:13,080
on the market like yesterday.

213
00:17:13,080 --> 00:17:15,040
So I told her next me you're the best,

214
00:17:15,040 --> 00:17:17,820
a little strange but good.

215
00:17:17,820 --> 00:17:20,351
- Hey, thanks, pal, I owe you one.

216
00:17:20,351 --> 00:17:21,780
- That's all right.

217
00:17:21,780 --> 00:17:24,000
She left right after you called anyway.

218
00:17:24,000 --> 00:17:25,740
- Sorry about that too.

219
00:17:25,740 --> 00:17:27,390
- She wanted to talk.

220
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:29,640
After midnight I don't wanna
talk to nobody about nothing

221
00:17:29,640 --> 00:17:31,503
unless it's a 976 number.

222
00:17:32,790 --> 00:17:33,810
Figured if I turned out the light

223
00:17:33,810 --> 00:17:36,006
maybe I wouldn't see her mouth moving.

224
00:17:36,006 --> 00:17:36,839
The problem is I said

225
00:17:36,839 --> 00:17:39,577
"Look, Gina, I'm trying
to concentrate here,

226
00:17:39,577 --> 00:17:41,700
"all this gabbing ain't helping."

227
00:17:41,700 --> 00:17:43,260
- Let me guess, your candor

228
00:17:43,260 --> 00:17:44,730
and your sensitivity didn't work,

229
00:17:44,730 --> 00:17:45,840
and she split.

230
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:47,778
- Nah, it turns out her name ain't Gina.

231
00:17:47,778 --> 00:17:49,830
- You're a big Reed.

232
00:17:49,830 --> 00:17:52,290
- Well maybe but at least I sleep nights.

233
00:17:52,290 --> 00:17:53,280
Hey, let's go get some chow,

234
00:17:53,280 --> 00:17:55,590
'cause you ain't got anything to eat here.

235
00:17:55,590 --> 00:17:56,940
Hey, that's what you need.

236
00:17:56,940 --> 00:17:57,773
- What?

237
00:17:57,773 --> 00:17:59,940
- A woman yapping at you for
about an hour every night,

238
00:17:59,940 --> 00:18:01,200
it'll put you right to sleep man,

239
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:02,513
I swear to God.

240
00:18:02,513 --> 00:18:05,180
(Nick laughing)

241
00:18:07,063 --> 00:18:09,813
(engine revving)

242
00:18:29,061 --> 00:18:31,978
(knocking on door)

243
00:18:34,802 --> 00:18:37,830
- Why did you say those
things to me yesterday?

244
00:18:37,830 --> 00:18:39,480
How do you know about the dreams?

245
00:18:40,530 --> 00:18:41,733
- He's in your dreams?

246
00:18:43,969 --> 00:18:45,183
All right, come in.

247
00:18:50,970 --> 00:18:53,070
I feel it so strongly.

248
00:18:53,070 --> 00:18:56,550
There is someone there,
he's looking for you.

249
00:18:56,550 --> 00:18:58,200
I don't know who or why,

250
00:18:58,200 --> 00:19:00,885
but you must feel it.

251
00:19:00,885 --> 00:19:03,103
- I feel like I know him.

252
00:19:03,103 --> 00:19:04,833
I know his touch.

253
00:19:05,700 --> 00:19:06,540
I know his face.

254
00:19:06,540 --> 00:19:07,410
I can feel him,

255
00:19:07,410 --> 00:19:09,933
but what does it mean?

256
00:19:11,257 --> 00:19:13,020
- I can't answer your questions

257
00:19:13,020 --> 00:19:14,336
unless I give you a reading,

258
00:19:14,336 --> 00:19:17,130
and you don't believe in that.

259
00:19:17,130 --> 00:19:19,563
- Please, Cicily, I feel
like I'm going crazy.

260
00:19:22,050 --> 00:19:23,321
- All right.

261
00:19:23,321 --> 00:19:25,200
I'll need an object,

262
00:19:25,200 --> 00:19:26,750
do you have something personal?

263
00:19:27,810 --> 00:19:29,340
- How about this?

264
00:19:29,340 --> 00:19:30,173
- That's fine.

265
00:19:31,017 --> 00:19:33,767
(dramatic music)

266
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,930
- What?

267
00:19:45,930 --> 00:19:47,280
- Where did that come from?

268
00:19:48,469 --> 00:19:53,167
- He gave it to me last
night in the dream.

269
00:19:53,167 --> 00:19:54,723
- Psychokinetic teleportation.

270
00:19:55,652 --> 00:19:58,402
(dramatic music)

271
00:20:06,995 --> 00:20:08,373
Oh he loves you.

272
00:20:10,460 --> 00:20:13,200
He loves you so much.

273
00:20:13,200 --> 00:20:14,650
- I feel like I love him too.

274
00:20:16,951 --> 00:20:17,784
I,

275
00:20:19,110 --> 00:20:21,063
I can't have him though, he's not real.

276
00:20:23,280 --> 00:20:24,303
- Yes he is real.

277
00:20:25,170 --> 00:20:27,150
He's the missing part of your life

278
00:20:27,150 --> 00:20:29,283
that so desperately needs to be found.

279
00:20:30,540 --> 00:20:31,955
It's a love that has transcended heaven

280
00:20:31,955 --> 00:20:35,853
and Earth and materialized
in the palm of your hand.

281
00:20:37,230 --> 00:20:38,253
- You're scaring me.

282
00:20:39,510 --> 00:20:41,110
- There's something else, Moira.

283
00:20:42,420 --> 00:20:45,240
For as much as your fate
wants to bring you together

284
00:20:45,240 --> 00:20:46,778
there's a dark, evil power determined

285
00:20:46,778 --> 00:20:48,363
to keep you apart.

286
00:20:49,200 --> 00:20:51,600
- I don't wanna hear anymore of this.

287
00:20:51,600 --> 00:20:52,650
I never should have come here.

288
00:20:52,650 --> 00:20:53,880
- I know you're afraid,

289
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:57,858
but you must help him try to find you.

290
00:20:57,858 --> 00:21:01,413
If you don't, Moira, it'll
never be finished, never.

291
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:05,094
(gentle music)

292
00:21:22,049 --> 00:21:23,190
- May I help you?

293
00:21:23,190 --> 00:21:24,510
- Hi, just one, please.

294
00:21:24,510 --> 00:21:25,793
- Right this way.

295
00:21:25,793 --> 00:21:27,843
- No, no, it's a great piece of property.

296
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,620
- So how much is that lady
paying for the fix up?

297
00:21:31,620 --> 00:21:34,773
- Same as always, 150
a day plus materials.

298
00:21:35,790 --> 00:21:37,110
Why don't you give her a call,

299
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:38,370
tell her you'll take the job.

300
00:21:38,370 --> 00:21:39,270
You know you need the money,

301
00:21:39,270 --> 00:21:40,590
you ain't worked in weeks.

302
00:21:40,590 --> 00:21:41,940
Maybe you can get her
to come up a little bit,

303
00:21:41,940 --> 00:21:43,257
you know, if you catch my drift.

304
00:21:43,257 --> 00:21:44,728
- You're unbelievable.

305
00:21:44,728 --> 00:21:45,870
- What are you talking about?

306
00:21:45,870 --> 00:21:46,770
She ain't a bad looking broad

307
00:21:46,770 --> 00:21:48,003
for a woman her age.

308
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,143
- I don't even know how
I spend time with you.

309
00:21:55,344 --> 00:21:58,094
(dramatic music)

310
00:22:02,310 --> 00:22:05,610
- Hi good morning, could I
get you something to drink?

311
00:22:05,610 --> 00:22:07,020
- Just coffee, thanks.

312
00:22:07,020 --> 00:22:08,864
- Okay, I'll be right back.

313
00:22:08,864 --> 00:22:11,614
(dramatic music)

314
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:19,650
- What she say?

315
00:22:19,650 --> 00:22:20,730
- There's no answer.

316
00:22:20,730 --> 00:22:21,930
Look, I gotta go to the marina,

317
00:22:21,930 --> 00:22:22,830
I'll give her a call from there.

318
00:22:22,830 --> 00:22:23,663
- All right.

319
00:22:24,616 --> 00:22:27,366
(dramatic music)

320
00:22:31,560 --> 00:22:34,489
- [Waiter] Here you go,
ma'am, here's your coffee.

321
00:22:34,489 --> 00:22:36,120
Do you take cream and sugar with that?

322
00:22:36,120 --> 00:22:37,140
- [Moira] Do you have any sweetener?

323
00:22:37,140 --> 00:22:38,700
- Of course.

324
00:22:38,700 --> 00:22:39,810
There you go.

325
00:22:39,810 --> 00:22:41,160
Are you ready to order now?

326
00:22:42,084 --> 00:22:43,653
- Just give me a minute.

327
00:22:45,900 --> 00:22:48,273
- Excuse me, ma'am, are you feeling okay?

328
00:22:49,209 --> 00:22:50,559
- Yeah, I'm fine, I'm fine.

329
00:22:52,107 --> 00:22:54,857
(dramatic music)

330
00:23:15,000 --> 00:23:16,208
- Hey Nick,

331
00:23:16,208 --> 00:23:18,041
what is it this week?

332
00:23:18,041 --> 00:23:19,430
- I had to add some rot lights, back stays

333
00:23:19,430 --> 00:23:21,090
in case of rough water.

334
00:23:21,090 --> 00:23:22,440
- You're not gonna see much rough water

335
00:23:22,440 --> 00:23:23,520
tied up to that dock.

336
00:23:23,520 --> 00:23:25,230
- Did you come down here
to bust my chops, Ned,

337
00:23:25,230 --> 00:23:27,210
or did you come here for a reason?

338
00:23:27,210 --> 00:23:28,760
- Rent on the slip's due again.

339
00:23:32,070 --> 00:23:34,620
- Look, I'll have to pay you
in a couple weeks ago, okay?

340
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,690
I just got a house unbelievable nearby,

341
00:23:36,690 --> 00:23:39,180
in fact I gotta go call the
real estate lady right now.

342
00:23:39,180 --> 00:23:40,330
Say, you got a quarter?

343
00:23:41,459 --> 00:23:42,453
- Get out.

344
00:23:44,190 --> 00:23:45,023
Here.

345
00:23:45,023 --> 00:23:45,856
- Thanks.

346
00:23:47,340 --> 00:23:48,690
- I'll add it to your bill.

347
00:24:09,248 --> 00:24:10,201
- Hi, Marion.

348
00:24:10,201 --> 00:24:11,700
- Hi Nick Bridges.

349
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:12,717
- Nice to meet you.

350
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,143
- I'm really sorry, Reed gave me a key,

351
00:24:14,143 --> 00:24:15,930
but I must have misplaced it somewhere.

352
00:24:15,930 --> 00:24:18,220
- Oh, that's all right, I
have a backdoor key with me.

353
00:24:18,220 --> 00:24:20,010
There are holes that need to be patched

354
00:24:20,010 --> 00:24:21,325
and plastered all through the house,

355
00:24:21,325 --> 00:24:22,544
everything needs paint.

356
00:24:22,544 --> 00:24:25,320
Oh, this banister is
loose, it needs some work.

357
00:24:25,320 --> 00:24:26,649
And there's water damage

358
00:24:26,649 --> 00:24:29,430
to the master bedroom ceiling upstairs,

359
00:24:29,430 --> 00:24:30,263
follow me.

360
00:24:35,910 --> 00:24:37,743
Come on, I won't bite you.

361
00:24:45,828 --> 00:24:48,578
(dramatic music)

362
00:25:16,514 --> 00:25:18,165
- Oh my God, that's it.

363
00:25:18,165 --> 00:25:21,748
(dramatic music continues)

364
00:25:34,317 --> 00:25:36,027
- Out here the rain
gutters have blown down,

365
00:25:36,027 --> 00:25:38,220
and I want you to check
the shutters out, please.

366
00:25:38,220 --> 00:25:40,103
Come on, I'll show you the downstairs.

367
00:25:45,467 --> 00:25:48,159
(knocking on door)

368
00:25:48,159 --> 00:25:50,909
(dramatic music)

369
00:26:15,004 --> 00:26:18,587
(dramatic music continues)

370
00:26:25,590 --> 00:26:27,120
The kitchen needs a lot of cosmetic work,

371
00:26:27,120 --> 00:26:29,100
but it's in pretty good shape, you know?

372
00:26:29,100 --> 00:26:30,119
Speaking of pretty good shape,

373
00:26:30,119 --> 00:26:32,088
you work out?

374
00:26:32,088 --> 00:26:33,671
- Uh, no, not much.

375
00:26:34,541 --> 00:26:37,291
(dramatic music)

376
00:26:42,990 --> 00:26:44,970
- Well I'd really like to
start showing the house soon,

377
00:26:44,970 --> 00:26:46,407
so do what you can to spruce the place up,

378
00:26:46,407 --> 00:26:49,103
and I will be a very happy woman.

379
00:26:49,103 --> 00:26:52,380
(dramatic music)

380
00:26:52,380 --> 00:26:53,213
Something wrong?

381
00:26:54,480 --> 00:26:55,530
- No.

382
00:26:55,530 --> 00:26:56,577
I'm sorry.

383
00:26:56,577 --> 00:26:58,557
Everything seems great.

384
00:26:58,557 --> 00:27:00,870
I'd say a week, maybe two at the most.

385
00:27:00,870 --> 00:27:02,280
- Great, I'll come by in a couple of days

386
00:27:02,280 --> 00:27:03,288
to check out the progress.

387
00:27:03,288 --> 00:27:06,155
And if you need anything at all,

388
00:27:06,155 --> 00:27:08,197
just give me a call okay?

389
00:27:08,197 --> 00:27:10,947
(dramatic music)

390
00:27:28,918 --> 00:27:31,585
(gentle music)

391
00:27:43,920 --> 00:27:45,570
- Moira.

392
00:27:45,570 --> 00:27:47,853
- Oh, Daniel, hi.

393
00:27:48,942 --> 00:27:51,269
- You seem nervous.

394
00:27:51,269 --> 00:27:52,473
Did I frighten you?

395
00:27:54,120 --> 00:27:57,153
- No, I just didn't expect
you to be here that's all.

396
00:28:00,630 --> 00:28:02,823
- You're late, where were you?

397
00:28:04,590 --> 00:28:06,450
- Well I had met Mindy for lunch,

398
00:28:06,450 --> 00:28:08,730
and then we took in a new exhibit

399
00:28:08,730 --> 00:28:09,878
at the Fourth Street Gallery.

400
00:28:09,878 --> 00:28:11,823
- Ah, did you like it?

401
00:28:12,720 --> 00:28:13,710
- It's not really my cup of tea,

402
00:28:13,710 --> 00:28:14,543
I, oh.

403
00:28:15,690 --> 00:28:16,620
- If you're gonna lie, Moira,

404
00:28:16,620 --> 00:28:18,960
you better learn to do a better job.

405
00:28:18,960 --> 00:28:20,763
Melinda called here asking for you.

406
00:28:21,600 --> 00:28:23,460
You know, if I didn't know any better,

407
00:28:23,460 --> 00:28:25,650
I would think that you
were seeing someone.

408
00:28:25,650 --> 00:28:27,033
Pick up the fucking mail.

409
00:28:30,111 --> 00:28:31,440
(Moira crying)

410
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:33,090
I have a business dinner tonight,

411
00:28:34,380 --> 00:28:35,575
when you and I get back,

412
00:28:35,575 --> 00:28:38,220
you and I are gonna have
a very clear discussion

413
00:28:38,220 --> 00:28:39,520
of what's expected of you.

414
00:28:40,898 --> 00:28:43,481
(gentle music)

415
00:28:47,730 --> 00:28:49,590
I have another job for you.

416
00:28:49,590 --> 00:28:50,897
No.

417
00:28:50,897 --> 00:28:53,310
I want you to follow my wife.

418
00:28:53,310 --> 00:28:54,480
I wanna know where she goes,

419
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:57,173
who she sees, how long she stays.

420
00:28:57,173 --> 00:28:58,143
Right.

421
00:28:59,040 --> 00:29:01,527
I wanna know if she's having an affair,

422
00:29:01,527 --> 00:29:04,360
and if she is I want details.

423
00:29:04,360 --> 00:29:07,777
(gentle music continues)

424
00:29:14,501 --> 00:29:15,420
- I wish you'd tell me when you're gonna

425
00:29:15,420 --> 00:29:16,950
use me as an excuse, Moira.

426
00:29:16,950 --> 00:29:18,180
God, I feel terrible.

427
00:29:18,180 --> 00:29:19,146
- No, no, it's okay.

428
00:29:19,146 --> 00:29:21,870
I should have been thinking faster.

429
00:29:21,870 --> 00:29:23,340
I should have been home on time.

430
00:29:23,340 --> 00:29:24,660
- Don't be crazy.

431
00:29:24,660 --> 00:29:25,890
I'm calling my lawyer.

432
00:29:25,890 --> 00:29:26,723
- Forget it, Mindy.

433
00:29:26,723 --> 00:29:28,672
- If this isn't sufficient
grounds for divorce,

434
00:29:28,672 --> 00:29:29,887
I don't know what is.

435
00:29:29,887 --> 00:29:32,611
- You don't divorce a man like Daniel,

436
00:29:32,611 --> 00:29:35,880
he'd make sure I ended up with nothing.

437
00:29:35,880 --> 00:29:36,810
- So what?

438
00:29:36,810 --> 00:29:39,243
At least you'd still
have your self respect.

439
00:29:40,290 --> 00:29:42,590
- I'm not gonna get far
on self respect, am I?

440
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:47,910
- Moira, if he won't
give you a fair divorce,

441
00:29:47,910 --> 00:29:49,410
then humiliate him into it.

442
00:29:49,410 --> 00:29:50,430
- Yeah, how?

443
00:29:50,430 --> 00:29:52,380
- You told me yourself
he's screwing his secretary

444
00:29:52,380 --> 00:29:53,700
under this very roof,

445
00:29:53,700 --> 00:29:55,320
and there's gotta be a
way to turn that around,

446
00:29:55,320 --> 00:29:56,669
and make it work for you.

447
00:29:56,669 --> 00:29:58,200
- Mindy, you're talking about a man

448
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,330
who socializes with
judges and politicians,

449
00:30:00,330 --> 00:30:01,470
it's my word against his,

450
00:30:01,470 --> 00:30:03,697
and whoever he's throwing
a campaign contribution to.

451
00:30:03,697 --> 00:30:05,142
- You know as well as I do

452
00:30:05,142 --> 00:30:08,190
the minute something
starts to stink bad enough

453
00:30:08,190 --> 00:30:09,360
judges and politicians

454
00:30:09,360 --> 00:30:11,617
are the first ones off this band wagon.

455
00:30:11,617 --> 00:30:15,540
- Do you have any idea what
you're suggesting I do?

456
00:30:15,540 --> 00:30:20,160
- I'm suggesting blackmail,
extortion, incrimination.

457
00:30:20,160 --> 00:30:22,239
Humiliation is the one
thing a man like Daniel

458
00:30:22,239 --> 00:30:24,213
cannot deal with.

459
00:30:25,140 --> 00:30:26,130
- You know there was a time

460
00:30:26,130 --> 00:30:28,560
when I really thought I loved him,

461
00:30:28,560 --> 00:30:31,380
thought he would take
such good care of me.

462
00:30:31,380 --> 00:30:33,030
How could I have been that wrong?

463
00:30:34,620 --> 00:30:35,797
I need some air.

464
00:30:40,727 --> 00:30:44,253
- Honey, you know there
is no real Mr. Right.

465
00:30:45,090 --> 00:30:48,420
Any relationship is good
for a few years at best,

466
00:30:48,420 --> 00:30:49,617
then you get what you can out of it,

467
00:30:49,617 --> 00:30:50,717
and you move on.

468
00:30:50,717 --> 00:30:53,160
- Do you really believe that?

469
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,110
- I'm living proof of that.

470
00:30:55,110 --> 00:30:56,070
Three ex husbands,

471
00:30:56,070 --> 00:30:57,423
and I loved all of them,

472
00:30:58,437 --> 00:30:59,610
for a few months anyway.

473
00:30:59,610 --> 00:31:00,720
- Don't you think that there's someone

474
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:02,100
out there for everyone?

475
00:31:02,100 --> 00:31:04,890
Someone you could spend
the rest of your life with?

476
00:31:04,890 --> 00:31:05,723
- No.

477
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:08,280
- You're full of it.

478
00:31:08,280 --> 00:31:10,680
Melinda Taft, Vaneggers and Ryan,

479
00:31:10,680 --> 00:31:13,180
otherwise you wouldn't be
seeing a fortune teller.

480
00:31:15,291 --> 00:31:17,874
(gentle music)

481
00:31:23,340 --> 00:31:25,383
- Hey Nick, Nick, where are you?

482
00:31:27,570 --> 00:31:28,403
- Yeah?

483
00:31:29,451 --> 00:31:31,501
- Come on down, I got a surprise for you.

484
00:31:36,660 --> 00:31:40,017
Hey Nick, this is Fawn, her friend Vicki.

485
00:31:40,017 --> 00:31:41,432
Fawn, Nick, Nick, Vicki.

486
00:31:41,432 --> 00:31:42,265
- Hi.

487
00:31:42,265 --> 00:31:44,097
Reed, what are you doing?

488
00:31:44,097 --> 00:31:46,080
- It turns out Fawn and I were gonna go

489
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,449
catch that new French film at the Royale,

490
00:31:48,449 --> 00:31:50,940
and her friend Vicki
here had nothing to do.

491
00:31:50,940 --> 00:31:52,620
- You were gonna catch a French film?

492
00:31:52,620 --> 00:31:53,453
- Yeah.

493
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,727
- Oh, I just love foreign films,

494
00:31:54,727 --> 00:31:57,600
they're so artistic.

495
00:31:57,600 --> 00:31:59,357
- Yeah, me too.

496
00:31:59,357 --> 00:32:01,590
- So there I am standing
in front of the theater

497
00:32:01,590 --> 00:32:03,360
with two of the prettiest girls in town,

498
00:32:03,360 --> 00:32:04,849
thinking to myself "What a shame?"

499
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:06,150
- You thought that to yourself, did you?

500
00:32:06,150 --> 00:32:07,860
- Yeah, to myself.

501
00:32:07,860 --> 00:32:09,450
- Great place, Nick.

502
00:32:09,450 --> 00:32:10,283
- Thanks.

503
00:32:10,283 --> 00:32:11,239
- I thought what a shame
that my friend Nick

504
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,200
is sitting home alone.

505
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:16,800
- You are gonna love my friend Vicki.

506
00:32:16,800 --> 00:32:19,091
She's very smart.

507
00:32:19,091 --> 00:32:21,840
She's into art and stuff like that,

508
00:32:21,840 --> 00:32:24,450
but she's a little shy.

509
00:32:24,450 --> 00:32:26,220
- Can you excuse me for just a second?

510
00:32:26,220 --> 00:32:27,053
- Sure.

511
00:32:27,053 --> 00:32:28,800
- Reed, what the hell are you doing?

512
00:32:28,800 --> 00:32:29,997
I am not in the mood for this tonight.

513
00:32:29,997 --> 00:32:33,150
- I know that, Nick, you're
never in the mood anymore,

514
00:32:33,150 --> 00:32:33,983
so I'm doing you a favor.

515
00:32:33,983 --> 00:32:35,160
I'm taking your mind,

516
00:32:35,160 --> 00:32:36,330
whatever's left of it,

517
00:32:36,330 --> 00:32:38,070
off of whatever it is
that's bothering you,

518
00:32:38,070 --> 00:32:39,390
and putting it back where it belongs.

519
00:32:39,390 --> 00:32:42,030
So lighten up and enjoy the party, pal.

520
00:32:42,030 --> 00:32:44,253
Okay, come on, let's have a toast here.

521
00:32:45,584 --> 00:32:48,167
(gentle music)

522
00:32:57,967 --> 00:33:01,384
(gentle music continues)

523
00:33:05,704 --> 00:33:08,954
- You know, I really have to get going.

524
00:33:10,260 --> 00:33:11,093
Fawn.
- What?

525
00:33:11,093 --> 00:33:11,926
- Now.

526
00:33:13,020 --> 00:33:14,696
- Yeah, sure, I'll take you.

527
00:33:14,696 --> 00:33:15,626
- It was really nice to meet you, Nick.

528
00:33:15,626 --> 00:33:17,181
Don't get up.

529
00:33:17,181 --> 00:33:19,024
- You know, we should really
do this again sometime.

530
00:33:19,024 --> 00:33:22,061
How about we go to that new
film at the Royale next week?

531
00:33:22,061 --> 00:33:23,580
It'll be fabulous.

532
00:33:23,580 --> 00:33:25,380
- Maybe Nick'll feel better by then.

533
00:33:27,030 --> 00:33:27,870
- After you drop them off,

534
00:33:27,870 --> 00:33:29,100
why don't you come back by?

535
00:33:29,100 --> 00:33:30,300
- Come back by?

536
00:33:30,300 --> 00:33:32,700
If I get real lucky tonight

537
00:33:32,700 --> 00:33:33,803
I might get lucky to night.

538
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:37,053
If I get really lucky
tonight, you catch my drift.

539
00:33:40,031 --> 00:33:43,042
- I just don't wanna
be alone tonight, okay?

540
00:33:43,042 --> 00:33:43,875
- Alone?

541
00:33:43,875 --> 00:33:45,030
What the hell is wrong with you, Nick?

542
00:33:45,030 --> 00:33:47,035
You've been alone all night.

543
00:33:47,035 --> 00:33:49,080
Even if I get turned
down on both accounts,

544
00:33:49,080 --> 00:33:50,490
why would I wanna come back here?

545
00:33:50,490 --> 00:33:51,810
I'll go find a dark bar

546
00:33:51,810 --> 00:33:53,677
and get drunk or something
because you my friend

547
00:33:53,677 --> 00:33:55,478
have become a real drag.

548
00:33:55,478 --> 00:33:56,700
You don't wanna talk about it,

549
00:33:56,700 --> 00:33:58,170
you don't want anybody's help,

550
00:33:58,170 --> 00:34:00,240
you just sit around and pine over

551
00:34:00,240 --> 00:34:02,790
drawings of some fantasy dream lady,

552
00:34:02,790 --> 00:34:05,296
and you're starting to depress me.

553
00:34:05,296 --> 00:34:06,129
And if you know me at all

554
00:34:06,129 --> 00:34:08,220
you know that this is all I am,

555
00:34:08,220 --> 00:34:10,567
and I can't afford to be where you are.

556
00:34:11,439 --> 00:34:14,022
(gentle music)

557
00:34:30,895 --> 00:34:33,645
(dramatic music)

558
00:34:39,770 --> 00:34:42,437
(clock tolling)

559
00:34:44,346 --> 00:34:46,929
(gentle music)

560
00:35:03,898 --> 00:35:06,565
(intense music)

561
00:35:35,278 --> 00:35:37,945
(gentle music)

562
00:36:24,158 --> 00:36:27,241
- This isn't just a dream, I know it.

563
00:36:32,270 --> 00:36:33,853
- Well, well, well.

564
00:36:34,989 --> 00:36:36,987
It's 3:00 in the morning,

565
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:38,223
and you're still up.

566
00:36:39,510 --> 00:36:42,330
Waiting to have our little conversation?

567
00:36:42,330 --> 00:36:44,280
- Daniel, you've had a bit to drink,

568
00:36:44,280 --> 00:36:45,859
don't you think this
could wait til morning?

569
00:36:45,859 --> 00:36:48,109
- What would you do be
doing up at this hour?

570
00:36:49,170 --> 00:36:52,834
You don't wanna talk,
you don't wanna sleep,

571
00:36:52,834 --> 00:36:54,827
what is it that you want, Moira?

572
00:36:56,100 --> 00:36:58,173
You wanna walk around in a haze?

573
00:36:59,340 --> 00:37:02,940
You're disrespectful, you're evasive,

574
00:37:02,940 --> 00:37:05,163
and now you've become a liar too.

575
00:37:06,630 --> 00:37:08,730
You know, I don't understand you.

576
00:37:08,730 --> 00:37:10,830
I have given everything any woman

577
00:37:10,830 --> 00:37:12,751
could possibly want,

578
00:37:12,751 --> 00:37:15,930
and you have nothing to do all day except

579
00:37:15,930 --> 00:37:18,467
take care of the house,

580
00:37:18,467 --> 00:37:19,367
and you know what?

581
00:37:20,427 --> 00:37:22,563
You have managed to neglect that too.

582
00:37:23,580 --> 00:37:24,568
- Daniel,

583
00:37:24,568 --> 00:37:27,870
if you don't like the
way I keep your house,

584
00:37:27,870 --> 00:37:29,733
why don't you hire a house keeper?

585
00:37:31,080 --> 00:37:32,400
- Don't you tell me what to do.

586
00:37:32,400 --> 00:37:35,250
I will not have a stranger in my house,

587
00:37:35,250 --> 00:37:37,140
touching my personal things,

588
00:37:37,140 --> 00:37:38,580
do you hear me?

589
00:37:38,580 --> 00:37:39,990
I ask you to do one thing,

590
00:37:39,990 --> 00:37:40,823
one thing,

591
00:37:40,823 --> 00:37:42,540
and you can't even get that right.

592
00:37:42,540 --> 00:37:43,380
- Daniel, please.

593
00:37:43,380 --> 00:37:45,147
- Shut the fuck up when I'm talking.

594
00:37:45,147 --> 00:37:45,980
Do you hear me?

595
00:37:45,980 --> 00:37:46,977
You're gonna clean,

596
00:37:46,977 --> 00:37:49,112
and then you're gonna clean
some more, you hear me?

597
00:37:49,112 --> 00:37:50,160
And you're gonna clean

598
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:51,247
because if you can't sleep

599
00:37:51,247 --> 00:37:54,187
then you're gonna clean
all night every night,

600
00:37:54,187 --> 00:37:55,020
do you hear me?

601
00:37:55,020 --> 00:37:55,853
- Daniel, just stop.

602
00:37:55,853 --> 00:37:57,686
- Shut the fuck up and clean.

603
00:37:57,686 --> 00:38:00,436
(dramatic music)

604
00:38:02,643 --> 00:38:05,010
You'll clean, do you understand?

605
00:38:05,010 --> 00:38:07,967
You'll clean until you understand
how much I have given you,

606
00:38:07,967 --> 00:38:10,795
and how much I can takeaway.

607
00:38:10,795 --> 00:38:11,628
Clean.

608
00:38:16,563 --> 00:38:19,146
(gentle music)

609
00:38:21,874 --> 00:38:24,204
(Moira crying)

610
00:38:24,204 --> 00:38:25,037
- [TV] Beautiful cubic zirconia ring

611
00:38:25,037 --> 00:38:26,589
that I personally have ever seen,

612
00:38:26,589 --> 00:38:27,643
ever seen

613
00:38:27,643 --> 00:38:28,523
look at this cut.

614
00:38:28,523 --> 00:38:30,750
Look at the clarity in that ring,

615
00:38:30,750 --> 00:38:31,583
it's magnificent.

616
00:38:31,583 --> 00:38:35,381
This is a solitary cut,
cubic zirconia ring.

617
00:38:35,381 --> 00:38:39,330
Two carrots, two carrots,

618
00:38:39,330 --> 00:38:41,310
and no one will ever know.

619
00:38:41,310 --> 00:38:42,210
Now, ladies and gentleman,

620
00:38:42,210 --> 00:38:44,594
we only have 15 rings.

621
00:38:44,594 --> 00:38:47,261
(phone ringing)

622
00:38:48,478 --> 00:38:51,145
(phone ringing)

623
00:38:54,000 --> 00:38:54,833
- Hello.

624
00:38:54,833 --> 00:38:58,172
- Hey, Reed, hope it's not too late, man,

625
00:38:58,172 --> 00:38:59,640
hope I'm not interrupting anything.

626
00:38:59,640 --> 00:39:01,290
- Nick?

627
00:39:01,290 --> 00:39:02,490
It's 3:00 in the morning,

628
00:39:02,490 --> 00:39:04,440
what's the matter, what are
you doing up at this hour?

629
00:39:04,440 --> 00:39:06,510
- Well I watched the Home Shopping Network

630
00:39:06,510 --> 00:39:07,390
for a couple hours,

631
00:39:07,390 --> 00:39:09,540
and cleaned out the fridge.

632
00:39:09,540 --> 00:39:11,190
- That is truly the most pathetic thing

633
00:39:11,190 --> 00:39:12,303
I have ever heard.

634
00:39:13,530 --> 00:39:15,300
Nick, do me a favor, would you?

635
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,980
Get a life.

636
00:39:16,980 --> 00:39:17,813
- I just wanted to call,

637
00:39:17,813 --> 00:39:20,880
and say I'm sorry for acting so weird.

638
00:39:20,880 --> 00:39:23,159
- I know, I know, it's okay man.

639
00:39:23,159 --> 00:39:25,440
- I'll talk to you tomorrow, okay?

640
00:39:25,440 --> 00:39:26,273
- Yeah, yeah.

641
00:39:26,273 --> 00:39:27,106
You all right?

642
00:39:27,106 --> 00:39:27,939
- Yeah, I'm fine.

643
00:39:27,939 --> 00:39:29,730
I'll give you a call tomorrow.

644
00:39:29,730 --> 00:39:32,483
- [TV] We're down to 10 rings,
this is your last chance.

645
00:39:37,649 --> 00:39:38,935
(gentle music)

646
00:39:38,935 --> 00:39:40,336
if you want the most beautiful rings

647
00:39:40,336 --> 00:39:41,598
you've ever seen in your life,

648
00:39:41,598 --> 00:39:43,955
you gotta call right now.

649
00:39:43,955 --> 00:39:47,372
(gentle music continues)

650
00:39:51,191 --> 00:39:52,302
- [Daniel] Moira.

651
00:39:52,302 --> 00:39:53,135
- Mr. Davis.

652
00:39:53,135 --> 00:39:54,141
- Morning Mark.

653
00:39:54,141 --> 00:39:55,233
Moira.

654
00:39:56,940 --> 00:39:57,773
This coffee's cold.

655
00:39:57,773 --> 00:39:58,606
Have you seen my wife?

656
00:39:58,606 --> 00:39:59,439
- [Mark] No, sir.

657
00:40:05,250 --> 00:40:06,083
- All right, come on, let's go,

658
00:40:06,083 --> 00:40:07,253
I'll call her from the office.

659
00:40:10,982 --> 00:40:13,565
(gentle music)

660
00:40:17,506 --> 00:40:19,983
(phone ringing)

661
00:40:19,983 --> 00:40:24,210
- Mindy, can you come over right now?

662
00:40:24,210 --> 00:40:25,443
I wanna divorce Daniel.

663
00:40:28,330 --> 00:40:29,163
- Moira.

664
00:40:31,103 --> 00:40:32,070
(gentle music)

665
00:40:32,070 --> 00:40:34,240
Moira, I got here as fast as I could.

666
00:40:36,366 --> 00:40:37,199
Hey,

667
00:40:39,320 --> 00:40:41,730
what did he do to you?

668
00:40:41,730 --> 00:40:43,860
- I need a divorce, Mindy.

669
00:40:43,860 --> 00:40:46,233
I don't know who else to call.

670
00:40:46,233 --> 00:40:47,580
- Well it's about time.

671
00:40:47,580 --> 00:40:50,343
Okay, what we need is a plan.

672
00:40:51,390 --> 00:40:53,550
- I just wanna scratch his eyes out.

673
00:40:53,550 --> 00:40:54,783
- That's a good plan.

674
00:40:56,225 --> 00:40:59,149
- I need to find a way to make him let go.

675
00:40:59,149 --> 00:41:02,070
And then I wanna be
far, far away from him.

676
00:41:02,070 --> 00:41:04,127
- Hey, hey, don't cry.

677
00:41:05,747 --> 00:41:07,923
You're gonna make me cry.

678
00:41:09,560 --> 00:41:11,190
Look, you're doing the right thing,

679
00:41:11,190 --> 00:41:12,513
you gotta fight back.

680
00:41:13,820 --> 00:41:15,442
- I'm scared.

681
00:41:15,442 --> 00:41:17,109
- I know, it's okay.

682
00:41:18,895 --> 00:41:19,728
It's okay.

683
00:41:20,640 --> 00:41:22,640
Come on, sweetie, let's get you dressed.

684
00:41:24,346 --> 00:41:25,190
(gentle music)

685
00:41:25,190 --> 00:41:26,945
- I don't like being in here, Mindy.

686
00:41:26,945 --> 00:41:29,463
- Relax, you said he was in Lancaster.

687
00:41:29,463 --> 00:41:32,089
- Well I never believe a word he says.

688
00:41:32,089 --> 00:41:32,922
- It'll just take a minute.

689
00:41:33,893 --> 00:41:34,726
Okay.

690
00:41:36,264 --> 00:41:37,440
It's voice activated.

691
00:41:37,440 --> 00:41:38,523
With this little transmitter

692
00:41:38,523 --> 00:41:42,120
everything Daniel D. Davis
says will be recorded,

693
00:41:42,120 --> 00:41:43,113
both sides.

694
00:41:45,180 --> 00:41:46,110
Maybe we can catch him

695
00:41:46,110 --> 00:41:47,883
and his secretary in the act.

696
00:41:49,200 --> 00:41:50,643
Wish we had a video camera.

697
00:41:51,870 --> 00:41:53,430
- Where'd you get all this stuff?

698
00:41:53,430 --> 00:41:54,780
- Oh, my ex-husband,

699
00:41:54,780 --> 00:41:57,120
he used to record his conversations.

700
00:41:57,120 --> 00:41:58,561
- He was an attorney for god's sake.

701
00:41:58,561 --> 00:41:59,910
- I know.

702
00:41:59,910 --> 00:42:02,207
The Rolls-Royce and the house in Carmel.

703
00:42:02,207 --> 00:42:05,340
- How can a wife do this to her husband?

704
00:42:05,340 --> 00:42:07,050
- How can a husband humiliate

705
00:42:07,050 --> 00:42:09,090
and abuse his wife on a daily basis?

706
00:42:09,090 --> 00:42:11,370
You're not doing anything to him,

707
00:42:11,370 --> 00:42:12,920
you're just getting it on tape.

708
00:42:14,190 --> 00:42:15,600
- You know, you're much too good at this,

709
00:42:15,600 --> 00:42:16,450
it's frightening.

710
00:42:23,070 --> 00:42:24,660
- Hey.

711
00:42:24,660 --> 00:42:26,070
Find anything interesting there?

712
00:42:26,070 --> 00:42:28,200
- No, you get the same junk mail I do.

713
00:42:28,200 --> 00:42:29,190
How's that job going?

714
00:42:29,190 --> 00:42:30,990
You're home a little early, aren't you?

715
00:42:30,990 --> 00:42:32,040
- If you really wanna know,

716
00:42:32,040 --> 00:42:32,951
I had lunch at the coffee house,

717
00:42:32,951 --> 00:42:34,501
I picked up some new rain gutters,

718
00:42:34,501 --> 00:42:36,570
and I came home.

719
00:42:36,570 --> 00:42:37,530
- You mutinous dog.

720
00:42:37,530 --> 00:42:39,390
You don't take this job
very seriously, do you?

721
00:42:39,390 --> 00:42:40,743
My ass is kind of on the line here.

722
00:42:40,743 --> 00:42:42,540
- Reed I'll get the job done, okay?

723
00:42:42,540 --> 00:42:44,190
Don't worry about it.

724
00:42:44,190 --> 00:42:45,510
My head's just not in it today.

725
00:42:45,510 --> 00:42:46,470
- Well that's just it, Nick,

726
00:42:46,470 --> 00:42:48,543
your head's not into anything lately.

727
00:42:50,030 --> 00:42:52,020
Even that boat of yours.

728
00:42:52,020 --> 00:42:52,853
Why don't you just go

729
00:42:52,853 --> 00:42:54,000
do whatever it is you wanna do?

730
00:42:54,000 --> 00:42:56,523
Go save a whale or something, whatever.

731
00:42:57,570 --> 00:42:58,470
Make a change, man.

732
00:42:58,470 --> 00:43:00,923
If this lake ain't working
for you, pick another one.

733
00:43:03,930 --> 00:43:05,700
I'm not smart like you are, Nick,

734
00:43:05,700 --> 00:43:07,080
if I had half the education you have,

735
00:43:07,080 --> 00:43:08,640
and knew one tenth the things

736
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:10,230
that are in your head,

737
00:43:10,230 --> 00:43:11,530
I'd go do something great.

738
00:43:19,900 --> 00:43:22,483
(gentle music)

739
00:43:38,818 --> 00:43:42,235
(gentle music continues)

740
00:44:08,963 --> 00:44:10,560
- Cicily, what did you mean when you said

741
00:44:10,560 --> 00:44:12,630
it would never be finished?

742
00:44:12,630 --> 00:44:14,906
- Well, it's like anything
else in life, Moira,

743
00:44:14,906 --> 00:44:16,800
you can't run away from your problems,

744
00:44:16,800 --> 00:44:19,191
you have to face them and take action.

745
00:44:19,191 --> 00:44:21,183
- You think I'm doing this to myself?

746
00:44:22,140 --> 00:44:23,250
- No.

747
00:44:23,250 --> 00:44:25,383
But you are allowing it to happen.

748
00:44:26,555 --> 00:44:31,500
You have the power to change
the direction of your life,

749
00:44:31,500 --> 00:44:33,483
but you must have the courage to do it.

750
00:44:34,620 --> 00:44:37,980
Sometimes it's good to take inventory,

751
00:44:37,980 --> 00:44:40,440
and sweet out the things we don't need,

752
00:44:40,440 --> 00:44:44,070
and make room for something else.

753
00:44:44,070 --> 00:44:46,260
- You're right, I know you're right.

754
00:44:46,260 --> 00:44:47,098
Thank you.

755
00:44:47,098 --> 00:44:49,331
- I'm always here for you, my dear.

756
00:44:49,331 --> 00:44:51,914
(gentle music)

757
00:44:55,484 --> 00:44:58,734
(intense gentle music)

758
00:45:11,265 --> 00:45:12,257
- Moira.

759
00:45:12,257 --> 00:45:14,490
- [Moira] I'm in here, honey.

760
00:45:14,490 --> 00:45:15,783
I hope you're hungry.

761
00:45:19,620 --> 00:45:20,550
- Oh, honey, look at this.

762
00:45:20,550 --> 00:45:22,023
This is beautiful,

763
00:45:22,860 --> 00:45:24,450
but I'm afraid I've
gotta go to Philadelphia

764
00:45:24,450 --> 00:45:25,600
on business right away.

765
00:45:27,090 --> 00:45:29,097
- I'm sorry about last night.

766
00:45:29,097 --> 00:45:30,273
- That's my girl.

767
00:45:31,274 --> 00:45:33,540
I promise you as soon as I get back

768
00:45:33,540 --> 00:45:34,890
we'll do something special.

769
00:45:37,225 --> 00:45:38,818
Okay.

770
00:45:38,818 --> 00:45:40,953
I'm gonna go pack.

771
00:45:40,953 --> 00:45:43,536
(gentle music)

772
00:45:55,941 --> 00:45:58,691
(fire crackling)

773
00:46:21,664 --> 00:46:24,909
(clock tolling)

774
00:46:24,909 --> 00:46:27,659
(dramatic music)

775
00:46:38,748 --> 00:46:41,331
(gentle music)

776
00:46:56,289 --> 00:46:59,706
(gentle music continues)

777
00:47:28,332 --> 00:47:30,999
(sensual music)

778
00:48:42,050 --> 00:48:44,698
(thunder booming)

779
00:48:44,698 --> 00:48:47,448
(dramatic music)

780
00:48:58,514 --> 00:49:02,097
(dramatic music continues)

781
00:49:41,164 --> 00:49:42,497
(gentle music)

782
00:49:42,497 --> 00:49:45,414
(knocking on door)

783
00:49:46,924 --> 00:49:49,674
(dramatic music)

784
00:49:53,454 --> 00:49:56,287
(nail gun firing)

785
00:50:05,546 --> 00:50:08,069
(nail gun firing)

786
00:50:08,069 --> 00:50:08,902
- Hello.

787
00:50:08,902 --> 00:50:09,735
Excuse me.

788
00:50:13,021 --> 00:50:14,018
I'll get it.

789
00:50:14,018 --> 00:50:14,851
- No, no, it's okay, I got it.

790
00:50:14,851 --> 00:50:17,085
- I didn't mean to frighten you.

791
00:50:17,085 --> 00:50:21,252
I wonder if you could tell
me who owns this house.

792
00:50:23,392 --> 00:50:24,309
- It's you.

793
00:50:29,174 --> 00:50:30,924
- How do you know me?

794
00:50:32,710 --> 00:50:34,388
- You wouldn't believe me.

795
00:50:34,388 --> 00:50:36,648
- I think I would.

796
00:50:36,648 --> 00:50:37,883
I have to go.

797
00:50:37,883 --> 00:50:39,300
- No, wait.

798
00:50:39,300 --> 00:50:41,040
Come on, please, don't go.

799
00:50:41,040 --> 00:50:42,120
- I don't know you.

800
00:50:42,120 --> 00:50:44,400
- My name's Nick, Nick Richardson.

801
00:50:44,400 --> 00:50:46,341
I dream about you.

802
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:47,970
(gentle music)

803
00:50:47,970 --> 00:50:49,270
You do know me, don't you?

804
00:50:50,821 --> 00:50:52,163
- Yeah.

805
00:50:52,163 --> 00:50:54,513
I don't understand how
this can be happening.

806
00:50:56,147 --> 00:50:58,933
I need some time to think about it.

807
00:50:58,933 --> 00:51:00,810
- I don't even know your name.

808
00:51:00,810 --> 00:51:02,010
- It's Moira.

809
00:51:02,010 --> 00:51:02,850
- Don't just walk away,

810
00:51:02,850 --> 00:51:04,250
promise me you'll come back.

811
00:51:05,963 --> 00:51:08,703
- I can't, I'm married.

812
00:51:10,740 --> 00:51:12,390
- Then at least meet me somewhere

813
00:51:13,560 --> 00:51:14,393
so we can talk,

814
00:51:14,393 --> 00:51:16,863
so we can try and understand all this.

815
00:51:18,660 --> 00:51:20,510
Don't just walk away from me, please.

816
00:51:21,570 --> 00:51:22,680
I have to go to the marina tomorrow,

817
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:25,200
there's a little park by the boat slips,

818
00:51:25,200 --> 00:51:26,584
meet me there.

819
00:51:26,584 --> 00:51:28,636
(gentle music)

820
00:51:28,636 --> 00:51:29,553
- I'll try.

821
00:51:31,159 --> 00:51:34,576
(gentle music continues)

822
00:51:56,473 --> 00:51:57,306
- Moira.

823
00:51:58,740 --> 00:52:00,930
Hey, what happened to you,

824
00:52:00,930 --> 00:52:01,950
I thought we were gonna celebrate

825
00:52:01,950 --> 00:52:03,864
Mr. Davis' unscheduled departure.

826
00:52:03,864 --> 00:52:05,251
- I was out.

827
00:52:05,251 --> 00:52:07,874
- Well I know you were out.

828
00:52:07,874 --> 00:52:09,150
What's wrong with you?

829
00:52:09,150 --> 00:52:11,104
You're as nervous as a cat.

830
00:52:11,104 --> 00:52:13,470
How much caffeine have you had today?

831
00:52:13,470 --> 00:52:15,124
- Mindy, I met someone.

832
00:52:15,124 --> 00:52:16,980
- What?

833
00:52:16,980 --> 00:52:18,883
- I met someone.

834
00:52:18,883 --> 00:52:20,491
- Excuse me?

835
00:52:20,491 --> 00:52:22,050
I heard what you said,

836
00:52:22,050 --> 00:52:24,870
I guess I just must have
missed something here.

837
00:52:24,870 --> 00:52:27,420
You're saying to me between yesterday

838
00:52:27,420 --> 00:52:30,270
and today while driving around in your car

839
00:52:30,270 --> 00:52:32,043
you just happened to meet someone?

840
00:52:33,111 --> 00:52:34,890
Have you been seeing someone all along?

841
00:52:34,890 --> 00:52:35,883
- No, no, I haven't,

842
00:52:35,883 --> 00:52:38,933
I swear I just met him by accident.

843
00:52:38,933 --> 00:52:40,980
- Well but kind of bait
are you using, honey,

844
00:52:40,980 --> 00:52:43,020
'cause they ain't biting
on what I'm fishing with.

845
00:52:43,020 --> 00:52:45,150
- Listen, it's a little more
complicated than that, Mindy.

846
00:52:45,150 --> 00:52:47,421
I have to meet him at the marina tomorrow.

847
00:52:47,421 --> 00:52:49,833
- Well, so what, you
want a ride or something?

848
00:52:50,940 --> 00:52:53,293
What is so complicated about this?

849
00:52:53,293 --> 00:52:56,156
I mean you're married to
a man that's an asshole,

850
00:52:56,156 --> 00:52:58,740
you're having an affair
with one that's not,

851
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,820
you tell him he's impeccable.

852
00:52:59,820 --> 00:53:00,933
- Mindy, please.

853
00:53:02,040 --> 00:53:03,214
- What's his name?

854
00:53:03,214 --> 00:53:04,681
- His name's Nick.

855
00:53:04,681 --> 00:53:05,640
- Nick.

856
00:53:05,640 --> 00:53:06,999
That's a nice name.

857
00:53:06,999 --> 00:53:08,520
What's he do?

858
00:53:08,520 --> 00:53:09,480
- I don't know.

859
00:53:09,480 --> 00:53:10,688
I think he's a carpenter or something.

860
00:53:10,688 --> 00:53:13,050
- Interesting, interesting.

861
00:53:13,050 --> 00:53:14,310
How's he in bed?

862
00:53:14,310 --> 00:53:15,143
- Melinda.

863
00:53:15,143 --> 00:53:16,800
- What?

864
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,240
- I just met him.

865
00:53:18,240 --> 00:53:19,500
I'm so nervous.

866
00:53:19,500 --> 00:53:20,777
- What are you nervous about?

867
00:53:20,777 --> 00:53:22,320
Moira, you deserve to be happy,

868
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:23,610
whether you realize it or not.

869
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:24,443
I need a drink.

870
00:53:26,042 --> 00:53:27,546
And I am not gonna sit here,

871
00:53:27,546 --> 00:53:30,930
and watch you let this guy
slip through your fingers.

872
00:53:30,930 --> 00:53:32,490
Either that or give me the address,

873
00:53:32,490 --> 00:53:33,930
and I'll go meet him.

874
00:53:33,930 --> 00:53:34,763
- Mind?

875
00:53:34,763 --> 00:53:35,596
- Yes?

876
00:53:35,596 --> 00:53:36,723
- Does this mean you think I should go?

877
00:53:36,723 --> 00:53:37,920
- Ugh, are you crazy?

878
00:53:37,920 --> 00:53:38,753
Yes.

879
00:53:38,753 --> 00:53:40,523
(Moira and Melinda laughing)

880
00:53:40,523 --> 00:53:43,106
(gentle music)

881
00:54:11,130 --> 00:54:13,289
- I didn't think you'd come.

882
00:54:13,289 --> 00:54:16,409
I didn't know how to find you.

883
00:54:16,409 --> 00:54:18,492
- I wasn't sure I should.

884
00:54:20,000 --> 00:54:21,513
- Do you believe in fate?

885
00:54:22,620 --> 00:54:23,453
Destiny?

886
00:54:26,130 --> 00:54:27,280
- I didn't think I did.

887
00:54:28,200 --> 00:54:29,673
I can't explain this.

888
00:54:30,930 --> 00:54:33,840
- I think I've dreamed
about you all my life.

889
00:54:33,840 --> 00:54:34,710
When I was a little kid,

890
00:54:34,710 --> 00:54:37,013
I used to think that everybody
dreamed about someone.

891
00:54:38,834 --> 00:54:41,938
The past few months you've
been in my sleep every night.

892
00:54:41,938 --> 00:54:43,338
I thought I was going crazy.

893
00:54:46,050 --> 00:54:47,200
- I know what you mean.

894
00:54:48,990 --> 00:54:50,940
- I can't believe you're actually here.

895
00:54:54,510 --> 00:54:56,243
Come on, I wanna show you something.

896
00:55:00,030 --> 00:55:01,530
This is it.

897
00:55:01,530 --> 00:55:02,493
- That's your boat?

898
00:55:03,420 --> 00:55:05,040
- It's my mistress.

899
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:06,540
40-foot catch double ender.

900
00:55:06,540 --> 00:55:07,500
- It's beautiful.

901
00:55:07,500 --> 00:55:08,333
- Thanks.

902
00:55:08,333 --> 00:55:09,704
- I've never been on a boat before.

903
00:55:09,704 --> 00:55:11,310
- (indistinct)

904
00:55:11,310 --> 00:55:13,260
Well you either love it or you hate it.

905
00:55:14,220 --> 00:55:17,220
I've been rebuilding it
for the past two years.

906
00:55:17,220 --> 00:55:19,020
She was originally builtin 1938,

907
00:55:19,020 --> 00:55:20,250
and I redesigned the spar

908
00:55:20,250 --> 00:55:21,300
and the rigging myself,

909
00:55:21,300 --> 00:55:23,449
and then I rebuilt and
realigned the haul so that-

910
00:55:23,449 --> 00:55:24,309
- Wait, wait, wait.

911
00:55:24,309 --> 00:55:26,007
I have no idea what that means.

912
00:55:26,007 --> 00:55:29,280
- I'm sorry, I guess I get a
little carried away sometimes.

913
00:55:29,280 --> 00:55:30,286
- That's all right, don't be sorry.

914
00:55:30,286 --> 00:55:32,460
It's nice to see someone with passion

915
00:55:32,460 --> 00:55:34,252
about something they love.

916
00:55:34,252 --> 00:55:36,963
- I love the sea, I always have.

917
00:55:37,860 --> 00:55:39,180
You know, I've always had this fantasy

918
00:55:39,180 --> 00:55:41,730
about just sailing away to Fiji

919
00:55:41,730 --> 00:55:42,903
or Bora Bora.

920
00:55:43,740 --> 00:55:47,250
I don't know, just leaving
and never coming back.

921
00:55:47,250 --> 00:55:48,250
- So why didn't you?

922
00:55:49,159 --> 00:55:50,725
- I don't know.

923
00:55:50,725 --> 00:55:52,713
I'm not brave enough, I guess.

924
00:55:54,600 --> 00:55:57,870
- I've always felt like I've
been waiting for something too.

925
00:55:57,870 --> 00:56:00,453
I suppose that's just an
excuse for being a coward.

926
00:56:03,270 --> 00:56:05,183
- You don't have anything to be afraid of.

927
00:56:07,476 --> 00:56:08,776
So you wanna take her out?

928
00:56:09,792 --> 00:56:11,165
- You mean right now?

929
00:56:11,165 --> 00:56:12,704
- Sure, why not?

930
00:56:12,704 --> 00:56:15,990
Hey, come on, let's see
if you love to sail.

931
00:56:18,888 --> 00:56:21,471
(gentle music)

932
00:56:28,082 --> 00:56:31,499
(gentle music continues)

933
00:56:55,192 --> 00:56:58,692
(gentle music continuing)

934
00:57:51,337 --> 00:57:54,837
(gentle music continuing)

935
00:58:18,187 --> 00:58:20,220
So how do you like sailing?

936
00:58:20,220 --> 00:58:21,570
- I love it.

937
00:58:21,570 --> 00:58:22,920
I wanna see where you live.

938
00:58:24,639 --> 00:58:25,472
- Okay.

939
00:58:26,372 --> 00:58:28,955
(gentle music)

940
00:58:50,460 --> 00:58:52,427
This place is a mess.

941
00:58:52,427 --> 00:58:53,427
- It's okay.

942
00:58:54,980 --> 00:58:57,660
- Look, make yourself comfortable.

943
00:58:57,660 --> 00:58:59,160
I'll be right back, I'm sorry.

944
00:59:02,790 --> 00:59:03,790
- Mind if I come up?

945
00:59:05,160 --> 00:59:07,673
- Sure, if you don't mind the mess.

946
00:59:20,097 --> 00:59:21,123
- You drew these?

947
00:59:22,110 --> 00:59:22,943
- Yeah.

948
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:25,170
- Wonderful.

949
00:59:25,170 --> 00:59:26,370
- Thanks.

950
00:59:26,370 --> 00:59:27,320
Don't look at that.

951
00:59:29,130 --> 00:59:29,973
- Is that me?

952
00:59:32,130 --> 00:59:32,963
- Sort of.

953
00:59:34,350 --> 00:59:35,763
Hey, look, come on.

954
00:59:38,714 --> 00:59:41,488
(gentle music)

955
00:59:41,488 --> 00:59:44,245
This is my favorite time of day.

956
00:59:44,245 --> 00:59:45,980
- Nick, it's beautiful.

957
00:59:45,980 --> 00:59:47,852
- You're beautiful.

958
00:59:47,852 --> 00:59:51,269
(gentle music continues)

959
01:00:21,840 --> 01:00:23,928
(gentle music continuing)

960
01:00:23,928 --> 01:00:25,023
You hungry?

961
01:00:25,023 --> 01:00:25,856
- No.

962
01:00:26,729 --> 01:00:27,670
- Cold?

963
01:00:27,670 --> 01:00:28,587
- A little.

964
01:00:30,918 --> 01:00:31,751
- Come on.

965
01:00:33,732 --> 01:00:36,315
(gentle music)

966
01:00:57,513 --> 01:01:00,050
You don't have to do
anything you don't wanna do.

967
01:01:00,050 --> 01:01:00,883
- I know.

968
01:01:04,086 --> 01:01:06,110
I wanna do everything with you.

969
01:01:06,110 --> 01:01:08,693
(gentle music)

970
01:01:36,256 --> 01:01:39,673
(gentle music continues)

971
01:01:51,370 --> 01:01:54,787
(gentle music continues)

972
01:02:28,402 --> 01:02:31,902
(gentle music continuing)

973
01:03:23,245 --> 01:03:26,745
(gentle music continuing)

974
01:04:23,468 --> 01:04:26,218
(dramatic music)

975
01:04:27,239 --> 01:04:28,586
- [Moira] I have to go.

976
01:04:28,586 --> 01:04:30,169
- Meet me tomorrow.

977
01:04:31,294 --> 01:04:32,127
- Where?

978
01:04:34,313 --> 01:04:36,551
- There's a little coffee shop on Sevio,

979
01:04:36,551 --> 01:04:38,618
let's say noon.

980
01:04:38,618 --> 01:04:40,295
- I know it.

981
01:04:40,295 --> 01:04:41,128
Okay.

982
01:04:41,995 --> 01:04:42,828
- I'll walk you down.

983
01:04:42,828 --> 01:04:43,740
- Nuh-uh.

984
01:04:43,740 --> 01:04:44,840
I'll see you tomorrow.

985
01:04:46,230 --> 01:04:48,240
Look so warm and cozy,

986
01:04:48,240 --> 01:04:49,790
I wanna remember you like this.

987
01:05:05,160 --> 01:05:05,993
- Moira.

988
01:05:10,638 --> 01:05:12,205
Am I late?

989
01:05:12,205 --> 01:05:13,320
- No, I'm early.

990
01:05:13,320 --> 01:05:14,310
- No, I was early,

991
01:05:14,310 --> 01:05:15,330
I was walking around the block

992
01:05:15,330 --> 01:05:17,180
for half an hour trying to kill time.

993
01:05:19,331 --> 01:05:20,883
Is something wrong?

994
01:05:21,884 --> 01:05:22,717
- No.

995
01:05:22,717 --> 01:05:23,973
I'm nervous.

996
01:05:25,290 --> 01:05:27,450
This is all so overwhelming.

997
01:05:27,450 --> 01:05:29,880
I'm not sure I understand any of this.

998
01:05:29,880 --> 01:05:31,430
- I don't understand it either.

999
01:05:32,640 --> 01:05:34,540
Nothing's ever felt this right for me.

1000
01:05:36,390 --> 01:05:38,190
That sounded pretty silly didn't it?

1001
01:05:39,330 --> 01:05:40,680
- I just need a little time

1002
01:05:41,550 --> 01:05:43,860
to let this all sink in.

1003
01:05:43,860 --> 01:05:46,203
- Just tell me I'm not dreaming this.

1004
01:05:47,190 --> 01:05:48,023
- You're not.

1005
01:05:51,090 --> 01:05:52,377
You have to get back to work,

1006
01:05:52,377 --> 01:05:54,120
and I have an appointment.

1007
01:05:54,120 --> 01:05:55,950
- Meet me tonight.

1008
01:05:55,950 --> 01:05:56,783
Come to my house,

1009
01:05:56,783 --> 01:05:57,750
or I'll come to you.

1010
01:05:57,750 --> 01:05:59,050
- No, that's not possible.

1011
01:06:01,200 --> 01:06:02,300
- Promise you'll come.

1012
01:06:04,050 --> 01:06:05,100
Every time you leave,

1013
01:06:06,169 --> 01:06:08,073
I get scared.

1014
01:06:10,620 --> 01:06:11,453
Promise me.

1015
01:06:13,050 --> 01:06:13,883
- All right.

1016
01:06:15,569 --> 01:06:18,828
I promise.

1017
01:06:18,828 --> 01:06:21,411
(gentle music)

1018
01:06:51,137 --> 01:06:53,887
(dramatic music)

1019
01:07:02,940 --> 01:07:04,380
- You're sure about this?

1020
01:07:04,380 --> 01:07:05,610
- Yes, sir.

1021
01:07:05,610 --> 01:07:07,084
I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.

1022
01:07:07,084 --> 01:07:08,595
(dramatic music)

1023
01:07:08,595 --> 01:07:10,578
- I want you to stay on the case.

1024
01:07:10,578 --> 01:07:11,943
- Yes, sir, I will.

1025
01:07:13,020 --> 01:07:14,270
- I wanna know who he is.

1026
01:07:19,620 --> 01:07:21,030
- Daniel, hi.

1027
01:07:21,030 --> 01:07:22,170
- Hi, honey.

1028
01:07:22,170 --> 01:07:23,003
- I'm sorry dinner is late,

1029
01:07:23,003 --> 01:07:24,060
I'll have it ready as soon as I can.

1030
01:07:24,060 --> 01:07:25,499
- Oh, that's okay.

1031
01:07:25,499 --> 01:07:26,700
Dinner can wait.

1032
01:07:26,700 --> 01:07:28,700
I think I deserve a proper welcome home.

1033
01:07:30,338 --> 01:07:33,373
(dramatic music)

1034
01:07:33,373 --> 01:07:34,380
- Ow, Daniel, don't.

1035
01:07:34,380 --> 01:07:35,213
Stop, you're hurting me.

1036
01:07:35,213 --> 01:07:36,540
- Shut up and get upstairs.

1037
01:07:37,650 --> 01:07:39,150
You shut up.

1038
01:07:39,150 --> 01:07:41,580
You're always wining about something.

1039
01:07:41,580 --> 01:07:44,730
You just stop it, just stop it.

1040
01:07:44,730 --> 01:07:46,380
How am I supposed to believe you?

1041
01:07:49,437 --> 01:07:52,320
You know, if you weren't such a liar,

1042
01:07:52,320 --> 01:07:54,224
I wouldn't have to do this to you.

1043
01:07:54,224 --> 01:07:55,583
But you're a liar.

1044
01:07:55,583 --> 01:07:56,831
Liar.

1045
01:07:56,831 --> 01:07:57,664
Liar.

1046
01:07:58,658 --> 01:07:59,643
Liar.

1047
01:07:59,643 --> 01:08:01,071
Liar.

1048
01:08:01,071 --> 01:08:02,597
A liar.

1049
01:08:02,597 --> 01:08:03,430
A liar.

1050
01:08:04,452 --> 01:08:07,838
(dramatic music)

1051
01:08:07,838 --> 01:08:10,421
(Moira crying)

1052
01:08:19,459 --> 01:08:23,042
(dramatic music continues)

1053
01:08:46,055 --> 01:08:48,972
(knocking on door)

1054
01:08:53,443 --> 01:08:54,973
- Hey, come on in.

1055
01:08:54,973 --> 01:08:57,270
- I'm sorry, Nick, I can't stay.

1056
01:08:57,270 --> 01:08:58,770
- Moira, what's the matter?

1057
01:08:58,770 --> 01:09:00,000
- I can't come here anymore.

1058
01:09:00,000 --> 01:09:00,990
- What is it?

1059
01:09:00,990 --> 01:09:03,450
- I mean I can't see you anymore, not now,

1060
01:09:03,450 --> 01:09:04,484
it's too complicated.

1061
01:09:04,484 --> 01:09:06,030
- Don't say that, Moira,
don't even say it.

1062
01:09:06,030 --> 01:09:07,980
- Look, if my husband finds out,

1063
01:09:07,980 --> 01:09:09,900
he's not gonna just let me go.

1064
01:09:09,900 --> 01:09:11,965
He's not gonna let this happen.

1065
01:09:11,965 --> 01:09:12,892
- Look at me.

1066
01:09:12,892 --> 01:09:13,725
Look at me and tell me

1067
01:09:13,725 --> 01:09:15,960
you don't feel exactly the same way I do.

1068
01:09:15,960 --> 01:09:17,760
- It's not about feelings right now.

1069
01:09:18,990 --> 01:09:20,424
It's more complicated than that.

1070
01:09:20,424 --> 01:09:22,680
I'd die if anything happened to you.

1071
01:09:22,680 --> 01:09:23,513
- Moira.

1072
01:09:24,362 --> 01:09:27,112
(dramatic music)

1073
01:09:45,990 --> 01:09:47,735
- I can't take it anymore, Mindy.

1074
01:09:47,735 --> 01:09:49,140
Every minute in this house

1075
01:09:49,140 --> 01:09:50,890
is like another minute off my life.

1076
01:09:55,200 --> 01:09:56,760
I gotta find a way to
get him into that office

1077
01:09:56,760 --> 01:09:58,230
and get the tape.

1078
01:09:58,230 --> 01:10:00,208
There's gotta be some shred,

1079
01:10:00,208 --> 01:10:02,283
some word of misbehavior.

1080
01:10:03,136 --> 01:10:04,440
(dramatic music)

1081
01:10:04,440 --> 01:10:05,910
- Moira.

1082
01:10:05,910 --> 01:10:08,028
- Okay, I gotta go, he's
waiting for me downstairs.

1083
01:10:08,028 --> 01:10:10,334
We'll be at Councilman Rodger's party.

1084
01:10:10,334 --> 01:10:11,167
Okay, bye.

1085
01:10:15,270 --> 01:10:16,370
- [Daniel] We're late.

1086
01:10:17,656 --> 01:10:18,656
- I'm ready.

1087
01:10:19,620 --> 01:10:21,450
- Well don't you look beautiful

1088
01:10:21,450 --> 01:10:23,610
in your very green dress.

1089
01:10:23,610 --> 01:10:24,480
- Thank you.

1090
01:10:24,480 --> 01:10:25,330
- You're welcome.

1091
01:10:26,250 --> 01:10:27,660
I had a problem come up,

1092
01:10:27,660 --> 01:10:28,650
there was a labor dispute,

1093
01:10:28,650 --> 01:10:30,690
and I'm gonna have to
meet you at the party.

1094
01:10:30,690 --> 01:10:33,240
- Daniel, you know I don't like
to go to these things alone.

1095
01:10:33,240 --> 01:10:36,120
- Come on, Moira, you
won't be alone at all,

1096
01:10:36,120 --> 01:10:38,760
your gold digging friend
Melinda will be there,

1097
01:10:38,760 --> 01:10:39,810
drinking and flirting,

1098
01:10:39,810 --> 01:10:42,263
and looking for another
wealthy husband, I'm sure.

1099
01:10:43,830 --> 01:10:46,140
- Moira, look, this
party is very important

1100
01:10:46,140 --> 01:10:47,040
to the councilman.

1101
01:10:47,040 --> 01:10:48,718
Now he needs to know
that he has our support,

1102
01:10:48,718 --> 01:10:50,559
so when you get there
I want you to explain

1103
01:10:50,559 --> 01:10:51,963
why I'm late.

1104
01:10:53,310 --> 01:10:54,860
I'll be there as soon as I can.

1105
01:10:58,325 --> 01:10:59,430
(dramatic music)

1106
01:10:59,430 --> 01:11:00,717
Drive carefully.

1107
01:11:03,236 --> 01:11:04,236
- Mr. Davis.

1108
01:11:12,192 --> 01:11:14,942
(dramatic music)

1109
01:11:21,970 --> 01:11:25,553
(dramatic music continues)

1110
01:12:18,202 --> 01:12:19,619
- You look great.

1111
01:12:23,377 --> 01:12:25,380
I'm sorry to ask you to come over so late,

1112
01:12:25,380 --> 01:12:28,117
it's just that, well, I wanted to see you.

1113
01:12:29,195 --> 01:12:31,260
- You look wonderful in a tuxedo.

1114
01:12:31,260 --> 01:12:32,370
- Here, let me take that for you.

1115
01:12:32,370 --> 01:12:33,203
- Thank you.

1116
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:37,050
So, where's Mrs. Davis?

1117
01:12:37,050 --> 01:12:38,709
- Oh, she's at a party.

1118
01:12:38,709 --> 01:12:40,860
I'm gonna meet up with her a little later.

1119
01:12:40,860 --> 01:12:42,799
- Ah, we're safe.

1120
01:12:42,799 --> 01:12:45,549
(dramatic music)

1121
01:12:53,561 --> 01:12:56,264
(Beverly laughing)

1122
01:12:56,264 --> 01:12:57,111
What are you doing?

1123
01:12:57,111 --> 01:12:58,290
- Afraid are you?

1124
01:12:58,290 --> 01:12:59,240
Well you should be.

1125
01:13:00,913 --> 01:13:03,559
You know when I was in
Philadelphia last week

1126
01:13:03,559 --> 01:13:06,390
some very vital information
about my company

1127
01:13:06,390 --> 01:13:08,940
mysteriously leaked into
the hands of a competitor,

1128
01:13:10,110 --> 01:13:12,393
and I lost a very, very big deal.

1129
01:13:13,440 --> 01:13:15,393
Now I don't like that,

1130
01:13:16,617 --> 01:13:20,043
and there are files
missing from my office.

1131
01:13:21,060 --> 01:13:22,137
- I didn't take them.

1132
01:13:22,137 --> 01:13:22,972
- Don't lie to me.

1133
01:13:22,972 --> 01:13:23,805
- [Beverly] I didn't take them.

1134
01:13:23,805 --> 01:13:24,638
- [Daniel] Don't lie to me.

1135
01:13:24,638 --> 01:13:25,864
(Beverly crying)

1136
01:13:25,864 --> 01:13:28,560
You know, you are a very
pretty girl, Miss Keen,

1137
01:13:28,560 --> 01:13:31,473
and I have enjoyed fucking you very much,

1138
01:13:33,210 --> 01:13:36,663
but if I don't have those
files back by tomorrow morning,

1139
01:13:38,858 --> 01:13:40,758
you're not gonna be so pretty anymore.

1140
01:13:42,047 --> 01:13:43,468
Now do you understand me?

1141
01:13:43,468 --> 01:13:44,965
Do you understand me?

1142
01:13:44,965 --> 01:13:46,235
- I understand.

1143
01:13:46,235 --> 01:13:47,068
- Huh?

1144
01:13:50,095 --> 01:13:52,178
Now get out of here.

1145
01:13:52,178 --> 01:13:54,928
(dramatic music)

1146
01:14:24,513 --> 01:14:25,346
- My God.

1147
01:14:28,642 --> 01:14:31,225
(gentle music)

1148
01:14:46,260 --> 01:14:47,520
- [Investigator] An independent contractor

1149
01:14:47,520 --> 01:14:49,290
by the name of Nicholas Richardson.

1150
01:14:49,290 --> 01:14:51,331
She spent the afternoon
with him on his boat,

1151
01:14:51,331 --> 01:14:53,217
and that evening they
were in his residence

1152
01:14:53,217 --> 01:14:55,131
at 19 Beach Walk.

1153
01:14:55,131 --> 01:14:56,100
There's more,

1154
01:14:56,100 --> 01:14:56,933
but mostly the same.

1155
01:14:56,933 --> 01:14:58,500
- [Daniel] Are you sure about this?

1156
01:14:58,500 --> 01:15:01,246
- [Investigator] Yes,
sir, Mr. Davis, I'm sorry.

1157
01:15:01,246 --> 01:15:02,579
- [Daniel] Stan.

1158
01:15:03,925 --> 01:15:04,758
- My God.

1159
01:15:05,932 --> 01:15:08,682
(dramatic music)

1160
01:15:11,741 --> 01:15:14,324
(gentle music)

1161
01:15:31,198 --> 01:15:34,615
(gentle music continues)

1162
01:16:15,683 --> 01:16:18,442
(dramatic music)

1163
01:16:18,442 --> 01:16:19,630
(Moira screaming)

1164
01:16:19,630 --> 01:16:21,390
- Whoa, take it easy.

1165
01:16:21,390 --> 01:16:24,265
I just came by to see if I
could get the tape recorder.

1166
01:16:24,265 --> 01:16:26,430
- I gotta get out of here right now, Min.

1167
01:16:26,430 --> 01:16:27,263
- What's going on?

1168
01:16:27,263 --> 01:16:29,460
- Daniel came in while I
was looking for the tape

1169
01:16:29,460 --> 01:16:30,870
so I hid behind the bar.

1170
01:16:30,870 --> 01:16:32,336
He was with his secretary, Beverly.

1171
01:16:32,336 --> 01:16:35,730
Min, he threatened to kill
her for betraying him.

1172
01:16:35,730 --> 01:16:37,120
- God, he found the tape?

1173
01:16:37,120 --> 01:16:38,640
- You don't understand,

1174
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,600
I heard part of the tape,

1175
01:16:39,600 --> 01:16:40,890
he had me followed.

1176
01:16:40,890 --> 01:16:42,210
He knows about Nick.

1177
01:16:42,210 --> 01:16:43,500
He knows about everything.

1178
01:16:43,500 --> 01:16:45,420
And he knows that I betrayed him.

1179
01:16:45,420 --> 01:16:46,410
- Do you have the tape?

1180
01:16:46,410 --> 01:16:48,038
- It's in the side pocket of the bag.

1181
01:16:48,038 --> 01:16:49,230
I gotta get out of here

1182
01:16:49,230 --> 01:16:50,670
before he realizes I'm not at the party,

1183
01:16:50,670 --> 01:16:52,650
he's gonna come looking for me.

1184
01:16:52,650 --> 01:16:53,812
- No.

1185
01:16:53,812 --> 01:16:54,645
If he's had you followed,

1186
01:16:54,645 --> 01:16:55,830
chances are somebody's
still following you.

1187
01:16:55,830 --> 01:16:56,730
- Oh my God,

1188
01:16:56,730 --> 01:16:57,810
and they know I'm here.

1189
01:16:57,810 --> 01:16:59,398
- Listen, this is what we're gonna do.

1190
01:16:59,398 --> 01:17:00,687
I want you to get in your car,

1191
01:17:00,687 --> 01:17:02,296
go to Cicily's down by the beach, okay?

1192
01:17:02,296 --> 01:17:03,630
- They'll just follow us.

1193
01:17:03,630 --> 01:17:04,463
- That's okay.

1194
01:17:04,463 --> 01:17:05,880
They can only follow one of us at a time,

1195
01:17:05,880 --> 01:17:07,073
this'll work, trust me.

1196
01:17:07,073 --> 01:17:07,950
- Min.

1197
01:17:07,950 --> 01:17:09,165
- Here, come on.

1198
01:17:09,165 --> 01:17:10,401
- God.

1199
01:17:10,401 --> 01:17:11,234
- Don't lose that tape.

1200
01:17:11,234 --> 01:17:13,567
- I won't, come on.

1201
01:17:13,567 --> 01:17:16,317
(dramatic music)

1202
01:17:56,700 --> 01:17:57,990
- Are you all right?

1203
01:17:57,990 --> 01:17:58,823
- You tell me.

1204
01:17:58,823 --> 01:17:59,940
I knew I was never gonna be able

1205
01:17:59,940 --> 01:18:01,170
to get away from this man.

1206
01:18:01,170 --> 01:18:02,523
- You can and you will.

1207
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:05,153
- I don't have the courage.

1208
01:18:05,153 --> 01:18:07,200
I'm not strong enough.

1209
01:18:07,200 --> 01:18:09,240
- You can remain a victim or not.

1210
01:18:09,240 --> 01:18:10,350
You have a choice.

1211
01:18:10,350 --> 01:18:11,183
Make it.

1212
01:18:12,983 --> 01:18:13,816
- Oh God.

1213
01:18:13,816 --> 01:18:14,649
- Sorry guys.

1214
01:18:14,649 --> 01:18:17,250
You're never gonna believe
what else is on this tape.

1215
01:18:17,250 --> 01:18:18,289
Daniel and Congressman Murphy

1216
01:18:18,289 --> 01:18:21,523
are involved in some kind
of land fraud or something.

1217
01:18:21,523 --> 01:18:23,466
They're falsifying documents.

1218
01:18:23,466 --> 01:18:25,440
Anyway, the files are missing,

1219
01:18:25,440 --> 01:18:27,240
somebody got wind of it.

1220
01:18:27,240 --> 01:18:28,800
If we can get those files, Moira,

1221
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:30,840
you wouldn't have to be afraid anymore.

1222
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:32,863
This could put him away.

1223
01:18:32,863 --> 01:18:33,696
- I can do it.

1224
01:18:33,696 --> 01:18:35,071
I can get the files.

1225
01:18:35,071 --> 01:18:35,904
- Good.

1226
01:18:35,904 --> 01:18:37,710
Give me your keys,

1227
01:18:37,710 --> 01:18:38,883
give me your jacket.

1228
01:18:39,960 --> 01:18:40,793
We'll switch cars.

1229
01:18:40,793 --> 01:18:42,150
By the time they figure
out what's going on

1230
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:43,710
you'll have time to get to a hotel,

1231
01:18:43,710 --> 01:18:46,110
and register under a different name.

1232
01:18:46,110 --> 01:18:48,150
- I have someplace to
go where I'll be safe.

1233
01:18:48,150 --> 01:18:49,270
Look, I'll call you.

1234
01:18:49,270 --> 01:18:50,493
- Be careful.

1235
01:18:52,650 --> 01:18:53,750
- Mind.

1236
01:18:53,750 --> 01:18:55,580
- Oh, that would be helpful.

1237
01:18:57,540 --> 01:18:59,189
- You were right,

1238
01:18:59,189 --> 01:19:01,290
he was a missing part of my life,

1239
01:19:01,290 --> 01:19:02,123
and I found him.

1240
01:19:02,970 --> 01:19:03,803
Thank you.

1241
01:19:05,900 --> 01:19:07,863
- It'll soon be all finished.

1242
01:19:09,237 --> 01:19:11,987
(dramatic music)

1243
01:19:18,690 --> 01:19:19,523
- Moira?

1244
01:19:20,720 --> 01:19:22,287
(dramatic music)

1245
01:19:22,287 --> 01:19:23,120
Moira?

1246
01:19:24,159 --> 01:19:26,794
(dramatic music continues)

1247
01:19:26,794 --> 01:19:27,627
Moira?

1248
01:19:29,511 --> 01:19:30,344
Moira?

1249
01:19:31,487 --> 01:19:33,457
Moira, where the hell are you?

1250
01:19:35,959 --> 01:19:38,709
(dramatic music)

1251
01:19:46,997 --> 01:19:48,247
Son of a bitch.

1252
01:19:50,935 --> 01:19:51,768
Moira?

1253
01:19:52,655 --> 01:19:56,238
(dramatic music continues)

1254
01:20:01,821 --> 01:20:04,440
(phone ringing)

1255
01:20:04,440 --> 01:20:05,273
- Yeah.

1256
01:20:05,273 --> 01:20:06,690
- Where's my wife?

1257
01:20:06,690 --> 01:20:08,310
- I'm tailing her right now.

1258
01:20:08,310 --> 01:20:09,309
As soon as she lands somewhere

1259
01:20:09,309 --> 01:20:11,073
I'll give you a call, Mr. Davis.

1260
01:20:11,910 --> 01:20:13,439
- You do that.

1261
01:20:13,439 --> 01:20:16,189
(dramatic music)

1262
01:20:39,585 --> 01:20:42,252
(phone ringing)

1263
01:20:47,503 --> 01:20:48,960
- Hello.

1264
01:20:48,960 --> 01:20:51,840
- Beverly Keen, this is Moira Davis.

1265
01:20:51,840 --> 01:20:52,920
Please don't hang up,

1266
01:20:52,920 --> 01:20:54,870
I need to talk to you about my husband.

1267
01:20:54,870 --> 01:20:56,002
I know what he did to you.

1268
01:20:56,002 --> 01:20:57,270
I wanna help you,

1269
01:20:57,270 --> 01:20:58,830
and you can help me.

1270
01:20:58,830 --> 01:21:00,810
- I can't talk to you on the phone.

1271
01:21:00,810 --> 01:21:01,867
- Well then meet me.

1272
01:21:01,867 --> 01:21:03,950
Listen, I know you have
no reason to trust me,

1273
01:21:03,950 --> 01:21:05,280
but your life is in danger

1274
01:21:05,280 --> 01:21:06,335
because of those files.

1275
01:21:06,335 --> 01:21:07,563
Please.

1276
01:21:08,400 --> 01:21:09,750
- Where?

1277
01:21:09,750 --> 01:21:10,994
- At a house that's being renovated.

1278
01:21:10,994 --> 01:21:14,550
1734 Seaview, by the marina.

1279
01:21:14,550 --> 01:21:16,383
And please bring the files.

1280
01:21:18,028 --> 01:21:20,553
- All right, fine.

1281
01:21:25,249 --> 01:21:26,400
(dramatic music)

1282
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:29,067
(phone ringing)

1283
01:21:31,830 --> 01:21:32,880
- Yeah?

1284
01:21:32,880 --> 01:21:34,830
- Mr. Davis, I followed your wife's car

1285
01:21:34,830 --> 01:21:36,000
all over the place.

1286
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,021
She pulled into Melinda Ryan's driveway,

1287
01:21:38,021 --> 01:21:41,473
but when I got close it wasn't your wife,

1288
01:21:41,473 --> 01:21:42,813
it was Miss Ryan.

1289
01:21:44,054 --> 01:21:45,840
They must have switched cars.

1290
01:21:45,840 --> 01:21:48,060
I'm sorry, Mr. Davis.

1291
01:21:48,060 --> 01:21:49,571
- You're sorry?

1292
01:21:49,571 --> 01:21:51,493
You don't know what sorry is.

1293
01:21:52,552 --> 01:21:55,302
(dramatic music)

1294
01:22:11,079 --> 01:22:15,371
(dramatic music continues)

1295
01:22:15,371 --> 01:22:17,839
(phone ringing)

1296
01:22:17,839 --> 01:22:19,309
- Pick up.

1297
01:22:19,309 --> 01:22:20,263
- [Answering Machine] Hi, this is Nick.

1298
01:22:20,263 --> 01:22:21,096
- Nick.

1299
01:22:21,096 --> 01:22:21,929
- [Answering Machine]
I'm not in right now.

1300
01:22:21,929 --> 01:22:22,890
If you leave your name

1301
01:22:22,890 --> 01:22:23,871
and number at the sound of the tone,

1302
01:22:23,871 --> 01:22:25,923
I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

1303
01:22:27,210 --> 01:22:29,400
- Nick, it's me, Moira.

1304
01:22:29,400 --> 01:22:31,500
I'm so sorry, Nick.

1305
01:22:31,500 --> 01:22:32,970
I'm so sorry.

1306
01:22:32,970 --> 01:22:34,230
My husband, he's crazy, Nick,

1307
01:22:34,230 --> 01:22:35,253
he had us followed.

1308
01:22:36,839 --> 01:22:39,672
(banging on door)

1309
01:22:40,731 --> 01:22:43,481
(dramatic music)

1310
01:23:00,734 --> 01:23:04,317
(dramatic music continues)

1311
01:23:06,420 --> 01:23:07,253
- [Moira] He'll be looking for me,

1312
01:23:07,253 --> 01:23:08,970
and I know he'll come there, Nick.

1313
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:10,200
I'm somewhere where he can't find me,

1314
01:23:10,200 --> 01:23:12,541
and soon, very soon all
of this will be over.

1315
01:23:12,541 --> 01:23:13,374
Nick, I do love you.

1316
01:23:13,374 --> 01:23:15,541
Don't give up on us, okay?

1317
01:23:17,688 --> 01:23:18,521
- Nick?

1318
01:23:21,089 --> 01:23:22,528
What the hell happened?

1319
01:23:22,528 --> 01:23:23,361
Nick?

1320
01:23:23,361 --> 01:23:24,595
Anybody here?

1321
01:23:24,595 --> 01:23:27,660
(dramatic music)

1322
01:23:27,660 --> 01:23:29,013
What's with the door, man?

1323
01:23:29,919 --> 01:23:32,790
- Son of a bitch, where's my wife?

1324
01:23:32,790 --> 01:23:35,194
- I don't know what you're
talking about, I swear.

1325
01:23:35,194 --> 01:23:38,070
I didn't know she was married, I swear it.

1326
01:23:38,070 --> 01:23:39,074
- You dumb fuck.

1327
01:23:39,074 --> 01:23:41,711
Now you got three seconds
to tell me where my wife is,

1328
01:23:41,711 --> 01:23:44,664
or I'm gonna blow your fucking brains out.

1329
01:23:44,664 --> 01:23:46,495
- I don't know who your wife is,

1330
01:23:46,495 --> 01:23:47,463
I swear to God.

1331
01:23:47,463 --> 01:23:48,644
- Really?

1332
01:23:48,644 --> 01:23:50,322
Well then how do you
explain the love message

1333
01:23:50,322 --> 01:23:51,420
on your machine?

1334
01:23:51,420 --> 01:23:52,611
- It ain't me.

1335
01:23:52,611 --> 01:23:53,790
This ain't my house.

1336
01:23:53,790 --> 01:23:55,583
I'm just looking for my friend, Nick.

1337
01:23:56,640 --> 01:23:57,699
- Nick?

1338
01:23:57,699 --> 01:23:58,767
- Yeah.

1339
01:23:58,767 --> 01:24:01,517
(dramatic music)

1340
01:24:11,663 --> 01:24:15,246
(dramatic music continues)

1341
01:24:25,980 --> 01:24:26,813
- Reed?

1342
01:24:29,884 --> 01:24:30,717
Reed?

1343
01:24:32,040 --> 01:24:32,873
Reed?

1344
01:24:35,653 --> 01:24:37,560
- You better get the number of that truck?

1345
01:24:37,560 --> 01:24:39,508
- What the hell happened?

1346
01:24:39,508 --> 01:24:40,800
- I don't know, he came
after me from behind,

1347
01:24:40,800 --> 01:24:42,300
some psycho thought I was you.

1348
01:24:42,300 --> 01:24:43,200
That's funny, huh?

1349
01:24:47,180 --> 01:24:48,783
- I'll get you some ice.

1350
01:24:49,725 --> 01:24:51,325
- I hope this broad is worth it.

1351
01:24:52,260 --> 01:24:53,370
Next time tell your girlfriend

1352
01:24:53,370 --> 01:24:54,203
not to leave a kiss

1353
01:24:54,203 --> 01:24:56,522
and tell message on the answering machine.

1354
01:24:56,522 --> 01:24:57,870
- She left a message?

1355
01:24:57,870 --> 01:24:58,703
- Yeah.

1356
01:25:03,390 --> 01:25:04,223
- [Moira] He'll be looking for me,

1357
01:25:04,223 --> 01:25:05,970
and I know he'll come there, Nick.

1358
01:25:05,970 --> 01:25:07,230
I'm somewhere where he can't find me,

1359
01:25:07,230 --> 01:25:09,300
and soon, very soon all this will be over.

1360
01:25:09,300 --> 01:25:11,913
Nick, I do love you,
don't give up on us okay.

1361
01:25:15,060 --> 01:25:16,010
- She's in trouble.

1362
01:25:18,450 --> 01:25:19,350
You gonna be okay?

1363
01:25:20,700 --> 01:25:21,810
I can't just sit here,

1364
01:25:21,810 --> 01:25:22,773
I gotta find her.

1365
01:25:25,170 --> 01:25:26,003
- How?

1366
01:25:27,292 --> 01:25:28,332
- I don't know.

1367
01:25:28,332 --> 01:25:29,673
I gotta try.

1368
01:25:30,810 --> 01:25:32,450
- Be careful.

1369
01:25:32,450 --> 01:25:35,033
(gentle music)

1370
01:26:00,240 --> 01:26:01,073
- Hello Melinda.

1371
01:26:02,943 --> 01:26:05,340
- I knew you'd show up sooner or later.

1372
01:26:05,340 --> 01:26:06,573
- Oh, I bet you did.

1373
01:26:08,220 --> 01:26:10,050
Where's my wife?

1374
01:26:10,050 --> 01:26:10,883
- I don't know.

1375
01:26:11,735 --> 01:26:13,302
- You did this, didn't you?

1376
01:26:13,302 --> 01:26:14,867
You put these ideas into her head,

1377
01:26:14,867 --> 01:26:16,630
you talked her into
leaving me, didn't you?

1378
01:26:16,630 --> 01:26:17,797
- No, you did,

1379
01:26:20,108 --> 01:26:21,608
I just helped her.

1380
01:26:24,866 --> 01:26:25,699
Good shot.

1381
01:26:27,307 --> 01:26:29,998
Is that how you hit, Moira?

1382
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:31,665
- [Daniel] Shut up.

1383
01:26:37,239 --> 01:26:38,280
- [Congressman Murphy] You assured me

1384
01:26:38,280 --> 01:26:39,818
this wouldn't be a problem.

1385
01:26:39,818 --> 01:26:41,460
How how'd they get that
information, Davis?

1386
01:26:41,460 --> 01:26:43,470
You better get to the bottom of this fast.

1387
01:26:43,470 --> 01:26:45,570
I promise you if my name is
linked to this in any way...

1388
01:26:45,570 --> 01:26:47,370
- [Daniel] That will not
happen, Congressman Murphy,

1389
01:26:47,370 --> 01:26:48,255
if you'll just hear me out.

1390
01:26:48,255 --> 01:26:50,400
- [Congressman Murphy]
Just take care of it.

1391
01:26:50,400 --> 01:26:51,630
- Where did you get that?

1392
01:26:51,630 --> 01:26:52,692
- I bugged your office.

1393
01:26:52,692 --> 01:26:55,037
- They can't prove anything with that.

1394
01:26:55,037 --> 01:26:56,963
- Oh, yes I can.

1395
01:26:56,963 --> 01:26:58,650
I made lots of copies,

1396
01:26:58,650 --> 01:27:00,388
and sent 'em out all over town.

1397
01:27:00,388 --> 01:27:02,910
Now it's your turn to be humiliated,

1398
01:27:02,910 --> 01:27:05,393
you self obsessed son of a bitch.

1399
01:27:08,653 --> 01:27:10,109
- I'll kill you.

1400
01:27:10,109 --> 01:27:11,357
(knocking on door)

1401
01:27:11,357 --> 01:27:12,383
- Door's open.

1402
01:27:12,383 --> 01:27:13,562
- [Man] Melinda.

1403
01:27:13,562 --> 01:27:14,864
Melinda, where are you?

1404
01:27:14,864 --> 01:27:17,514
I got here as fast as I could.

1405
01:27:17,514 --> 01:27:20,097
(gentle music)

1406
01:27:22,008 --> 01:27:24,758
(dramatic music)

1407
01:27:45,760 --> 01:27:49,343
(dramatic music continues)

1408
01:28:14,850 --> 01:28:17,433
(gentle music)

1409
01:28:34,666 --> 01:28:37,416
(dramatic music)

1410
01:29:14,812 --> 01:29:18,395
(dramatic music continues)

1411
01:29:19,998 --> 01:29:22,831
(thunder booming)

1412
01:30:19,028 --> 01:30:21,695
(gentle music)

1413
01:30:55,620 --> 01:30:56,620
- Oh my God.

1414
01:31:02,583 --> 01:31:05,333
(dramatic music)

1415
01:31:14,561 --> 01:31:18,544
- I'm very disappointed in you, Moira.

1416
01:31:18,544 --> 01:31:21,377
(Moira screaming)

1417
01:31:26,794 --> 01:31:28,652
(Moira coughing)

1418
01:31:28,652 --> 01:31:31,552
(dramatic music)

1419
01:31:31,552 --> 01:31:34,385
(Daniel groaning)

1420
01:31:39,607 --> 01:31:42,440
(Moira screaming)

1421
01:31:52,177 --> 01:31:55,010
(dramatic music)

1422
01:32:17,908 --> 01:32:19,075
- You're dead.

1423
01:32:21,303 --> 01:32:24,136
(nail gun firing)

1424
01:32:26,200 --> 01:32:28,783
(gentle music)

1425
01:32:35,699 --> 01:32:36,616
- You okay?

1426
01:32:38,584 --> 01:32:39,637
It's over.

1427
01:32:39,637 --> 01:32:40,804
It's all over.

1428
01:32:43,603 --> 01:32:46,182
- Don't ever let me go, Nick.

1429
01:32:46,182 --> 01:32:48,765
(gentle music)

1430
01:32:50,499 --> 01:32:53,332
(dramatic music)

1431
01:32:58,929 --> 01:33:00,844
- What's the matter honey,

1432
01:33:00,844 --> 01:33:02,463
having a bad dream?

1433
01:33:07,200 --> 01:33:08,447
How about some coffee?

1434
01:33:10,218 --> 01:33:12,968
(dramatic music)
