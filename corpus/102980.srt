Our boy did real good today, Jimbo.

- Where is everybody? Where's Roarke?
- Back there.

- Come with mama, baby.
- Vamos, babaloo. Volante! Volante!

What's the matter, Jimmy?

523
00:45:32,810 --> 00:45:35,973
- Check the area for secondary devices?
- [Roarke] The perimeter is clear.

- Did you print this shit? Is it printed?
- It's all been bagged and tagged.

There's no harm in listening...

- Fine.
