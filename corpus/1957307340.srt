You're a celebrity, Victor.

104
00:06:22,208 --> 00:06:24,083
Why don't you take
full advantage of that?

105
00:06:24,167 --> 00:06:26,667
If you can't make
the most of this situation,

106
00:06:26,750 --> 00:06:28,250
then how can anybody else?

107
00:06:28,333 --> 00:06:29,958

109
00:06:36,792 --> 00:06:38,042

What do people do
to people like me, huh?

112
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,708
Stick me in a zoo?
Lock me in a lab?

113
00:06:45,792 --> 00:06:47,208

114
00:06:47,292 --> 00:06:49,583
You're locked up here.

115

I mean, you're no more free
here in this apartment

116

locked behind bars.

118

what a choice is?

121
00:07:04,250 --> 00:07:05,583
You think I'm stupid?

122
00:07:06,708 --> 00:07:07,958
You don't think
I want to be out there

123
00:07:08,042 --> 00:07:09,083
all the time?

124
00:07:11,458 --> 00:07:13,125
I am literally...

125
00:07:14,042 --> 00:07:15,292
a statistic.

126
00:07:17,500 --> 00:07:20,042
And I don't need
to be confronted

127
00:07:20,125 --> 00:07:21,667
by more people like you,

128
00:07:21,750 --> 00:07:24,208

into my life.

129
00:07:25,000 --> 00:07:26,583

148
00:08:36,083 --> 00:08:37,375
I get it.

149
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:41,417

what it's like to be you?

150

that we're not all
the same either.
