1
00:00:26,276 --> 00:00:27,903
It's such a long way down

2
00:00:28,737 --> 00:00:29,947
and strange.

3
00:00:31,240 --> 00:00:32,449
The word becomes

4
00:00:33,742 --> 00:00:34,868
flesh.

5
00:00:35,827 --> 00:00:36,870
No.

6
00:00:37,412 --> 00:00:38,997
The body remains...

7
00:00:40,207 --> 00:00:41,375
what?

8
00:00:50,717 --> 00:00:53,053
She had traveled
light-years to get here.

9
00:00:54,096 --> 00:00:57,766
And in the vaporous fields of
her home star no one had bodies,

10
00:00:58,141 --> 00:01:00,477
or names, or identities -

11
00:01:01,436 --> 00:01:05,816
a living thought or feeling
stretching out in all directions -

12
00:01:07,901 --> 00:01:10,237
not measured or desired.

13
00:01:11,530 --> 00:01:12,823
Not owned.

14
00:01:15,826 --> 00:01:18,245
But here, in the flesh

15
00:01:21,123 --> 00:01:23,250
the revolution had come.

16
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,104
America had just
been liberated by Triple M,

17
00:01:44,563 --> 00:01:46,523
the Multi Media Monopoly.

18
00:01:47,858 --> 00:01:50,235
A collaborator,
I worked for the Ad Agency

19
00:01:50,611 --> 00:01:53,363
that swept Triple M into power
in the first place

20
00:01:53,697 --> 00:01:56,908
and, despite fierce
competition, kept it there.

21
00:01:58,452 --> 00:02:00,329
On the surface, nothing had changed.

22
00:02:01,121 --> 00:02:04,750
It was tough but at last we
were able to convince the population

23
00:02:05,083 --> 00:02:08,754
that their choice of the new regime
had been their own idea.

24
00:02:11,548 --> 00:02:13,967
It was a dictatorship
of the consumer now.

25
00:02:16,011 --> 00:02:18,096
What most people wanted,
most of the time,

26
00:02:18,430 --> 00:02:20,307
and were willing to pay for, was good.

27
00:02:20,641 --> 00:02:22,768
Whatever defied the market was bad.

28
00:02:23,101 --> 00:02:25,729
Mid-size, automatic, whatever.

29
00:02:26,480 --> 00:02:30,108
Disposable income was
the chief revolutionary virtue.

30
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,571
Everyone had what they wanted, always.

31
00:02:34,905 --> 00:02:37,491
As long as they did their part
and threw themselves,

32
00:02:37,824 --> 00:02:41,161
body and soul, towards the aim
of economic supremacy.

33
00:02:46,958 --> 00:02:49,544
But some people questioned
the agency's wisdom.

34
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:53,423
Some wondered if we hadn't
lost something important in ourselves.

35
00:02:53,757 --> 00:02:56,760
Some people resisted the inevitable
logic of the marketplace.

36
00:02:57,719 --> 00:03:00,305
A hated and feared underground
had begun to form.

37
00:03:00,722 --> 00:03:01,973
The partisans.

38
00:03:02,307 --> 00:03:04,851
Counter-revolutionaries
with no credit rating.

39
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:08,021
Living outside the corporate
body of the status quo.

40
00:03:08,772 --> 00:03:10,941
They were rounded up
and exiled to the moon

41
00:03:11,274 --> 00:03:14,444
to work the concessions of
the various Triple M theme parks.

42
00:03:14,778 --> 00:03:17,531
Terrorists were suspected everywhere.

43
00:03:17,864 --> 00:03:19,116
Like this.

44
00:03:20,075 --> 00:03:21,118
Right.
- No.

45
00:03:21,451 --> 00:03:25,664
Down?
- In. Down. Up. Back. Try it.

46
00:03:27,582 --> 00:03:30,293
Right, that's it. Will you
be needing ammunition?

47
00:03:31,878 --> 00:03:33,046
And it was me,

48
00:03:34,047 --> 00:03:35,132
just me,

49
00:03:35,757 --> 00:03:37,551
at the start of it all.

50
00:03:38,969 --> 00:03:40,887
The logical conclusion of all this

51
00:03:41,304 --> 00:03:44,558
is to think of each individual
as an investment:

52
00:03:44,891 --> 00:03:48,103
a stock, an actual property
with growth potential.

53
00:03:48,437 --> 00:03:52,691
The analysis proves that sexually
active and sexually available adults

54
00:03:53,024 --> 00:03:54,568
are the biggest spenders.

55
00:03:55,026 --> 00:03:56,153
And why is that?

56
00:03:56,611 --> 00:03:59,322
Because we market everything
so as to remind them

57
00:04:00,031 --> 00:04:03,535
that their identification with
obviously popular brand names

58
00:04:04,077 --> 00:04:06,663
will make them feel
better about themselves

59
00:04:06,997 --> 00:04:09,750
and make them appear
more attractive to others.

60
00:04:13,962 --> 00:04:17,048
It's the income generated
by the pursuit of happiness

61
00:04:17,382 --> 00:04:20,510
that subsidizes the revolution's
continued growth.

62
00:04:20,844 --> 00:04:25,098
I think the possibility exists for a
sort of chain reaction of market value.

63
00:04:25,432 --> 00:04:29,227
Well, it sounds appropriately
cutting edge but, I don't know...

64
00:04:29,561 --> 00:04:30,687
technical.

65
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:32,981
Fucking.

66
00:04:36,276 --> 00:04:39,029
When two people have sex
they invest in one another.

67
00:04:39,571 --> 00:04:43,575
Each one then goes to a credit machine,
they scan in their bar code,

68
00:04:44,284 --> 00:04:47,412
choose the new sexual activity
credit category

69
00:04:47,746 --> 00:04:50,207
and punch in their sex partner's name.

70
00:04:50,957 --> 00:04:54,753
When the central computer registers
the two entries it pairs them.

71
00:04:55,212 --> 00:04:59,382
Then each partner's value as a
consumer increases by a certain percent

72
00:04:59,800 --> 00:05:01,968
based on the current
state of the market.

73
00:05:04,596 --> 00:05:07,724
It was just an idea.
But that was my job.

74
00:05:08,058 --> 00:05:09,726
I was an idea man.

75
00:05:10,560 --> 00:05:13,188
Triple M took over
and worked out all the bugs,

76
00:05:13,522 --> 00:05:15,774
most notably creating
an insurance scheme

77
00:05:16,107 --> 00:05:17,943
that protected product and investor

78
00:05:18,276 --> 00:05:21,363
from the creation of bogus,
unearned personal value.

79
00:05:27,661 --> 00:05:29,704
The consequences were to be expected.

80
00:05:30,580 --> 00:05:34,543
Acts of love, charity and eroticism
for their own sake

81
00:05:35,085 --> 00:05:38,421
were soon seen
as perverse self-indulgences.

82
00:05:38,922 --> 00:05:42,884
Inhumane, uncivilized, barbaric.

83
00:06:00,068 --> 00:06:02,153
It's such a long way down,

84
00:06:02,487 --> 00:06:03,780
and strange.

85
00:06:05,365 --> 00:06:07,367
The word becomes flesh.

86
00:06:09,703 --> 00:06:10,704
No.

87
00:06:11,663 --> 00:06:14,124
The body becomes...

88
00:06:15,709 --> 00:06:16,835
what?

89
00:06:39,024 --> 00:06:43,320
The problem with heart surgery is
that it's perceived to be a last resort.

90
00:06:43,653 --> 00:06:45,989
A set back. One becomes stigmatized.

91
00:06:46,323 --> 00:06:49,576
It's for old people.
Sick people. Frankly, it's unattractive.

92
00:06:49,910 --> 00:06:51,703
It's got to be re-directed.

93
00:06:52,037 --> 00:06:53,872
Heart disease can no longer be seen

94
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:56,917
as a sign of bad living, wrong diets,
age and infirmity.

95
00:06:57,250 --> 00:07:00,378
It's the kind of thing that hip
thirty-year-olds might do

96
00:07:00,712 --> 00:07:01,963
because they can.

97
00:07:02,339 --> 00:07:04,841
People have to want heart surgery.

98
00:07:05,175 --> 00:07:07,761
It's their right!
- It might be worthwhile

99
00:07:08,094 --> 00:07:11,556
merging heartattack.com with
the Delirium Drug Corporation campaign.

100
00:07:11,890 --> 00:07:14,726
Good thinking, Benson.
Cecile, do you have those figures?

101
00:07:18,647 --> 00:07:22,108
As of eleven o'clock this morning
Delirium is the leading manufacturer

102
00:07:22,442 --> 00:07:26,237
of Viagamon, the virility enhancement
pill and many other sexual stimulants.

103
00:07:26,571 --> 00:07:29,783
I think we may be able to
cross-collateralize our interests here.

104
00:07:30,116 --> 00:07:33,370
And in the short term create
a recreational geriatric sex market.

105
00:07:33,703 --> 00:07:35,872
They'll want preventative heart surgery.

106
00:07:36,206 --> 00:07:38,541
I see a possibility
with higher end health clubs.

107
00:07:38,875 --> 00:07:40,877
It will involve insurance companies.

108
00:07:41,211 --> 00:07:43,505
I was never the most
ambitious man

109
00:07:44,047 --> 00:07:46,591
and my prestige at the firm
was fading fast.

110
00:07:47,258 --> 00:07:48,301
And no wonder.

111
00:07:49,052 --> 00:07:52,013
Compare the nature of the importance
my associates attach

112
00:07:52,347 --> 00:07:53,974
to the success of the campaign

113
00:07:54,307 --> 00:07:56,059
to that which I feel compelled

114
00:07:56,393 --> 00:07:58,561
to attribute to Cecile's behind.

115
00:07:58,937 --> 00:08:01,856
Jack? That's your account, right?

116
00:08:02,524 --> 00:08:05,235
Which?
- Brutal Youth children's wear.

117
00:08:05,819 --> 00:08:09,114
Yes, that's me. I've been doing
some preliminary conceptualizing.

118
00:08:11,157 --> 00:08:13,994
Yes, we've seen those.
Nice work, Jack.

119
00:08:14,577 --> 00:08:17,956
But, to be honest, the feeling is
the whole approach could be more...

120
00:08:18,289 --> 00:08:19,374
well, sexy.

121
00:08:19,708 --> 00:08:21,334
Much more provocative.

122
00:08:26,506 --> 00:08:27,841
The children's wear?

123
00:08:28,216 --> 00:08:30,051
Kids are not just children, Jack.

124
00:08:31,886 --> 00:08:33,304
They're consumers.

125
00:08:37,934 --> 00:08:39,728
Seems to have gone well.
- Think so?

126
00:08:40,061 --> 00:08:42,230
You didn't get fired.
- Look at that.

127
00:08:42,564 --> 00:08:44,190
What?
- The sky.

128
00:08:45,150 --> 00:08:46,317
It's just weather.

129
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:49,696
Cecile?
- Yes.

130
00:08:50,113 --> 00:08:53,116
You have nice legs.
- Thank you.

131
00:08:54,576 --> 00:08:56,786
Making a pass at someone
was risky

132
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,872
in the early days of the revolution.

133
00:08:59,330 --> 00:09:01,166
Although sex sold everything

134
00:09:01,499 --> 00:09:04,085
and aphrodisiacs
were the nation-state's cash crop,

135
00:09:04,419 --> 00:09:08,048
rape was punishable by death
and sexual harassment in the work place

136
00:09:08,381 --> 00:09:10,592
could do real damage
to your credit rating.

137
00:09:11,092 --> 00:09:13,470
There's more to me
than just my legs, you know.

138
00:09:21,686 --> 00:09:23,938
I don't doubt that for a minute, Cecile.

139
00:09:40,288 --> 00:09:42,165
Left.
- Right.

140
00:10:08,358 --> 00:10:11,653
Complimenting Cecile on her figure
was a necessary risk.

141
00:10:12,153 --> 00:10:13,780
I needed an alibi.

142
00:10:30,421 --> 00:10:32,882
Is there anything else
you need me to do?

143
00:10:33,216 --> 00:10:37,387
I'd like you to go to the window
and gaze out at the approaching storm.

144
00:10:43,101 --> 00:10:44,352
Like this?

145
00:10:59,075 --> 00:11:02,787
Okay. Now, there's going to be
a security desk on the left.

146
00:11:03,121 --> 00:11:05,373
You know what to do.
When you get her signal,

147
00:11:05,707 --> 00:11:07,876
move to the phone, punch in the code.

148
00:11:08,209 --> 00:11:09,419
I'll count to ten.

149
00:11:21,264 --> 00:11:23,433
What?
- There's no one here.

150
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:26,394
It's open. Look.
- No, no, no. Come away.

151
00:11:26,853 --> 00:11:29,856
But we're right here.
- No. Something's wrong.

152
00:11:30,190 --> 00:11:31,441
This is too easy.

153
00:11:54,631 --> 00:11:58,343
No. We shouldn't.
After all, we work together.

154
00:11:59,219 --> 00:12:01,054
You knew that when you came in here.

155
00:12:01,512 --> 00:12:04,265
I'm just playing hard to get.
Did it work?

156
00:12:08,686 --> 00:12:10,939
Maybe we should call this off.

157
00:12:12,607 --> 00:12:16,069
Why? What happened?
- I'm doing this for the wrong reasons.

158
00:12:16,402 --> 00:12:19,530
There are no wrong reasons.
You, of all people, must know that.

159
00:12:19,864 --> 00:12:22,283
Let's fuck and increase
our buying power.

160
00:12:31,793 --> 00:12:33,628
There's this thing between us now.

161
00:12:36,839 --> 00:12:38,132
I'm sorry.

162
00:12:53,481 --> 00:12:54,649
Downstairs. Quick.

163
00:13:02,115 --> 00:13:04,367
You fucker.
I bet you do this all the time.

164
00:13:07,870 --> 00:13:10,581
You can do things to me. I'll let you.

165
00:13:12,000 --> 00:13:13,751
I'll get you a taxi.

166
00:13:32,228 --> 00:13:33,938
What happened?
- A bombing.

167
00:13:34,272 --> 00:13:36,983
Counter-revolutionaries hit
the Triple M building.

168
00:13:37,317 --> 00:13:39,485
Come on, you can't stay here.
Move along.

169
00:13:45,992 --> 00:13:48,995
Go back to your homes. All is well.

170
00:13:49,620 --> 00:13:51,164
Details at eleven.

171
00:13:51,914 --> 00:13:56,252
Go back to your homes.
All is well. Details at eleven.

172
00:13:57,670 --> 00:13:58,963
Go back to your homes.

173
00:14:02,425 --> 00:14:05,053
Ten people were killed
and dozens injured

174
00:14:05,386 --> 00:14:09,599
when counter-revolutionaries attacked
the Information Services building.

175
00:14:09,932 --> 00:14:14,228
Government troops foiled their attempt
to immobilize the broadcast feed.

176
00:14:14,562 --> 00:14:17,315
The assassins were chased to
the New Jersey border,

177
00:14:17,648 --> 00:14:20,318
where a standoff is reported
to be in progress.

178
00:14:31,871 --> 00:14:32,872
Cecile.

179
00:14:34,457 --> 00:14:37,126
She'd have to wait.
I couldn't take any chances.

180
00:14:45,510 --> 00:14:49,389
I wandered the streets all night trying
to get word of what really happened.

181
00:14:49,722 --> 00:14:53,601
Information came in pieces,
contradictory, confused,

182
00:14:53,935 --> 00:14:55,561
too simple to be true.

183
00:14:56,521 --> 00:14:59,440
I sent three young kids out
to do nothing more complicated

184
00:14:59,774 --> 00:15:02,485
than throw a few switches
and interrupt the news.

185
00:15:02,819 --> 00:15:04,654
And now this.

186
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,031
More blood on my hands,

187
00:15:07,657 --> 00:15:08,991
more lives lost.

188
00:15:09,575 --> 00:15:10,660
For what?

189
00:15:11,119 --> 00:15:13,454
A different idea
of a worthwhile life?

190
00:15:13,996 --> 00:15:15,998
Some different conception of freedom?

191
00:15:16,749 --> 00:15:19,585
Or was I just doing
the same thing as Triple M,

192
00:15:19,961 --> 00:15:23,214
generating opportunities
for yet another kind of desire?

193
00:15:23,923 --> 00:15:25,341
The would-be hero,

194
00:15:26,050 --> 00:15:27,093
the would-be martyr,

195
00:15:28,136 --> 00:15:29,595
the would-be saint?

196
00:15:30,471 --> 00:15:34,183
How could one man make
so many mistakes and live?

197
00:16:02,462 --> 00:16:03,754
Hey, Rachel.

198
00:16:04,464 --> 00:16:07,967
Listen, I won't be in today.
I don't feel well.

199
00:16:10,094 --> 00:16:11,429
Thank you.

200
00:16:14,140 --> 00:16:15,349
Is Cecile there?

201
00:16:16,809 --> 00:16:17,810
No?

202
00:16:18,936 --> 00:16:21,647
No, nothing. I'll try back later.

203
00:16:32,033 --> 00:16:34,619
Cecile.
- I'm going to make a claim against you.

204
00:16:35,244 --> 00:16:38,498
Well, you have to do what
you have to do, Cecile.

205
00:16:39,373 --> 00:16:40,750
But I wish you wouldn't.

206
00:16:41,083 --> 00:16:43,836
You took advantage of me.
- I thought you wanted me to.

207
00:16:44,170 --> 00:16:46,631
What will people say?
- Look,

208
00:16:46,964 --> 00:16:48,799
no one has to know about this.

209
00:16:50,051 --> 00:16:51,093
I told Rachel.

210
00:16:52,386 --> 00:16:53,763
Why did you tell Rachel?

211
00:16:55,181 --> 00:16:58,476
She's my supervisor.
She has to co-sign my insurance claim.

212
00:17:04,690 --> 00:17:08,236
In those dark days a person
could insure their sex appeal.

213
00:17:08,861 --> 00:17:12,281
What had happened between Cecile
and me was a small collision

214
00:17:12,615 --> 00:17:17,328
that had left her confidence dented
and her value as a consumer compromised.

215
00:17:20,831 --> 00:17:23,209
The insurance company
would have to investigate

216
00:17:23,543 --> 00:17:26,420
and prove that our failed tryst
was in no way her fault.

217
00:17:32,093 --> 00:17:33,719
So what you're claiming

218
00:17:34,053 --> 00:17:37,974
is that you've never had sexual
intercourse with anyone but your wife?

219
00:17:38,474 --> 00:17:40,017
Yes.
- Who drowned?

220
00:17:40,935 --> 00:17:43,104
Yes, shortly after the revolution.

221
00:17:45,982 --> 00:17:48,150
Are you a religious man, Mister Bell?

222
00:17:48,484 --> 00:17:49,485
No.

223
00:17:50,528 --> 00:17:51,654
Are you sure?

224
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,756
I'm sorry to be the one
to tell you this,

225
00:18:11,090 --> 00:18:13,509
but with such a narrow band
of sexual activity,

226
00:18:13,843 --> 00:18:18,306
even with your position with the agency,
your consumer potential is very low,

227
00:18:18,639 --> 00:18:21,183
which, of course, means
an increase in your premium.

228
00:18:21,559 --> 00:18:23,352
I just want to do the right thing.

229
00:18:23,769 --> 00:18:25,229
Cecile, your case is upheld.

230
00:18:25,813 --> 00:18:28,733
Your premium remains
the same and your buying power too.

231
00:18:32,695 --> 00:18:36,073
Another black mark on the soul
of the gross national product.

232
00:18:36,782 --> 00:18:39,744
I was a thorn in the side
of the God-like economy,

233
00:18:40,077 --> 00:18:43,831
an inept leader of a resistance
doing little or no good at all,

234
00:18:44,373 --> 00:18:47,293
a cancer the authorities
wouldn't put up with forever

235
00:18:47,627 --> 00:18:51,213
and a covert strategist that partisans
could probably do without.

236
00:18:54,300 --> 00:18:58,054
But I was glad for Cecile.
I could understand her worry.

237
00:18:58,804 --> 00:19:00,640
It was a culture of desire.

238
00:19:01,057 --> 00:19:03,893
You had to want in order to be wanted

239
00:19:04,226 --> 00:19:07,188
and you had to be wanted
in order to survive.

240
00:19:16,906 --> 00:19:18,991
Mid-size. Automatic. Whatever.

241
00:19:20,201 --> 00:19:21,535
Thirty-five.

242
00:19:22,203 --> 00:19:23,371
Thank you.

243
00:19:44,517 --> 00:19:45,518
Like this.

244
00:19:47,019 --> 00:19:48,521
Right.
- No.

245
00:19:48,854 --> 00:19:52,483
Down?
- In. Down. Up. Back. Try.

246
00:19:54,485 --> 00:19:56,821
That's it.
Will you be needing ammunition?

247
00:20:26,517 --> 00:20:28,060
You sure you weren't followed?

248
00:20:28,394 --> 00:20:30,730
We did like Boss said, we split up.

249
00:20:31,272 --> 00:20:34,191
I tried to call.
I thought they'd trace the cell phones.

250
00:20:34,525 --> 00:20:36,444
Then I contacted Orchard Street.

251
00:20:36,944 --> 00:20:39,447
Orchard Street?
- They took that guy in.

252
00:20:39,780 --> 00:20:41,741
We saw it. We were standing there.

253
00:20:49,331 --> 00:20:50,708
William, take off.
- What?

254
00:20:51,041 --> 00:20:52,585
Scram. The back way. Now.

255
00:20:56,630 --> 00:20:59,216
Help me! Help me!
They're holding me hostage!

256
00:21:41,509 --> 00:21:43,844
I don't know what came over me.

257
00:21:44,178 --> 00:21:46,806
You said they took you hostage.
- She's my sister.

258
00:21:47,139 --> 00:21:48,724
Arrest him!
- For what?

259
00:21:49,058 --> 00:21:50,100
How old are you?

260
00:23:26,614 --> 00:23:27,656
Of course.

261
00:23:28,866 --> 00:23:30,784
It's such a long way down.

262
00:23:32,828 --> 00:23:33,913
And strange.

263
00:23:43,714 --> 00:23:44,840
Are you okay?

264
00:23:46,133 --> 00:23:47,384
The Boss is dead.

265
00:23:48,135 --> 00:23:52,348
Shit. No wonder.
Triple M's been all over the place.

266
00:23:56,060 --> 00:23:57,144
I'm outta here.

267
00:23:57,978 --> 00:24:00,272
Find a place to be. Good luck.

268
00:24:05,277 --> 00:24:06,654
Can I buy you a drink?

269
00:24:07,154 --> 00:24:08,197
I've got one.

270
00:24:09,448 --> 00:24:10,783
Can you buy me a drink?

271
00:24:11,742 --> 00:24:13,744
How old are you?
- Seventeen.

272
00:24:14,203 --> 00:24:16,080
Get out of here.
- No, really.

273
00:24:16,413 --> 00:24:18,123
Besides, I like older women.

274
00:25:20,102 --> 00:25:23,564
She's healthy but extremely
sensitive, physically.

275
00:25:24,940 --> 00:25:27,276
She's not barcoded.
- I know.

276
00:25:28,444 --> 00:25:32,281
My guess is she's an exile,
probably escaped during transport.

277
00:25:33,866 --> 00:25:36,160
Either that or she's...
- An immigrant.

278
00:25:37,286 --> 00:25:39,955
Soto speak.
- Any chance we can keep her here?

279
00:25:40,289 --> 00:25:41,415
It would be dangerous

280
00:25:41,749 --> 00:25:44,001
especially after the bombing last night.

281
00:25:45,002 --> 00:25:46,754
Triple M is on the look out for...

282
00:25:48,255 --> 00:25:49,381
immigrants.

283
00:25:51,467 --> 00:25:55,471
The major sore spot with Triple M
was the old regime's alleged contact

284
00:25:55,804 --> 00:25:59,099
with Star 147X in
the constellation Monday.

285
00:25:59,433 --> 00:26:02,478
Named after the hapless scientist
who first discovered it,

286
00:26:02,811 --> 00:26:04,063
Doctor Vincent Monday.

287
00:26:04,396 --> 00:26:06,690
It was assumed
the intelligence on that star

288
00:26:07,024 --> 00:26:11,236
still contributed unknown resources
towards the counter-revolutionary aim.

289
00:26:13,822 --> 00:26:14,948
Whatever it was,

290
00:26:15,365 --> 00:26:16,784
if it even existed,

291
00:26:17,618 --> 00:26:19,953
Triple M was determined to find out.

292
00:26:31,965 --> 00:26:33,467
What do you call yourself?

293
00:26:35,511 --> 00:26:36,804
No Body.

294
00:26:56,490 --> 00:26:58,575
It would take her time
to get used to it.

295
00:26:59,451 --> 00:27:01,787
The weight, the fatigue,

296
00:27:02,621 --> 00:27:05,958
the pressure of a boundary
between her and the rest of the world,

297
00:27:06,291 --> 00:27:07,751
between her and others.

298
00:27:08,752 --> 00:27:11,630
Here, even time has a body,

299
00:27:12,464 --> 00:27:14,967
a direction, weight.

300
00:27:30,816 --> 00:27:34,278
There are twenty or thirty people
all fucking each other downstairs.

301
00:27:35,028 --> 00:27:36,113
Yeah.

302
00:27:37,447 --> 00:27:38,824
I'm too depressed.

303
00:27:40,200 --> 00:27:41,577
Is there a credit machine?

304
00:27:42,327 --> 00:27:44,371
There's a lot of value being generated.

305
00:27:45,247 --> 00:27:46,498
Is this a brokerage firm?

306
00:27:47,499 --> 00:27:50,252
No. They just do it
because it feels good.

307
00:28:00,846 --> 00:28:03,182
You mean you're counter-revolutionaries?

308
00:28:06,476 --> 00:28:09,188
We were trying to save the world.
- From what?

309
00:28:11,815 --> 00:28:13,192
I don't know exactly.

310
00:28:13,567 --> 00:28:16,278
Your friend, the Boss,
was he a fanatic too?

311
00:28:16,987 --> 00:28:19,865
Is that what they call it?
- Malcontent, antisocial,

312
00:28:20,199 --> 00:28:22,201
enemy of the consumer, whatever.

313
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:33,587
He wasn't from around here.

314
00:28:55,609 --> 00:28:56,735
What's it like?

315
00:28:59,613 --> 00:29:00,948
It's scary at first.

316
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,167
Do you feel...

317
00:29:14,253 --> 00:29:15,462
taken advantage of?

318
00:29:21,510 --> 00:29:22,511
Yeah.

319
00:29:48,036 --> 00:29:50,080
It is such a long way down,

320
00:29:50,455 --> 00:29:51,665
and strange,

321
00:29:52,666 --> 00:29:53,792
to be one,

322
00:29:54,376 --> 00:29:55,419
alone.

323
00:29:57,212 --> 00:29:58,338
But to be one,

324
00:29:59,548 --> 00:30:00,632
whole.

325
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:17,190
That's too much.
Keep your mouth closed.

326
00:30:28,994 --> 00:30:31,121
Swallow. Relax this.

327
00:30:37,169 --> 00:30:38,211
Now eating.

328
00:30:49,681 --> 00:30:50,682
Chew.

329
00:31:09,076 --> 00:31:12,454
Listen, I have to go to work.
If the phone rings, don't answer it.

330
00:31:12,788 --> 00:31:15,332
If someone knocks on the door,
don't open it.

331
00:31:16,208 --> 00:31:17,376
Lay low.

332
00:31:19,961 --> 00:31:21,380
Lay low.

333
00:31:27,386 --> 00:31:29,304
Where the hell is Cecile?

334
00:31:29,638 --> 00:31:33,225
Shit! The CEO has been chewing
my head off for over an hour!

335
00:31:34,017 --> 00:31:37,771
Jack! What do you know about this
terrorist attack at the News Building?

336
00:31:39,272 --> 00:31:41,191
Some people were killed.

337
00:31:42,067 --> 00:31:43,860
And where were you
when it happened?

338
00:31:44,945 --> 00:31:48,990
Here. Working. Cecile too.

339
00:31:49,408 --> 00:31:51,451
Where the fuck is Cecile?

340
00:31:51,868 --> 00:31:55,080
Shit! Forget it. Benson, in my office!

341
00:31:57,582 --> 00:32:02,045
Look, Jack, I'm taking you off
the Brutal Youth kid's wear account.

342
00:32:02,379 --> 00:32:06,383
Putting you in charge of the soda pop
in the schools campaign. It's crucial.

343
00:32:07,134 --> 00:32:08,301
Sorry.

344
00:32:10,804 --> 00:32:12,431
That was it for me I thought.

345
00:32:12,764 --> 00:32:16,143
Gently nudged from the inner circle
while my associates orbited

346
00:32:16,476 --> 00:32:20,313
closer and closer around the CEO
and heavyweights up at Triple M.

347
00:32:20,647 --> 00:32:22,816
They must have known
I was a security risk.

348
00:32:23,150 --> 00:32:26,236
It was only a matter of time now
before the axe came down full.

349
00:32:26,570 --> 00:32:29,030
Jack, you have a visitor at reception.

350
00:32:42,627 --> 00:32:44,212
I thought you were dead.

351
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:46,006
But then...

352
00:32:46,923 --> 00:32:47,924
What?

353
00:32:49,676 --> 00:32:52,012
I mean, at the beach, in the car...

354
00:32:56,558 --> 00:32:59,060
You got my gun?
- Yeah.

355
00:33:03,356 --> 00:33:04,357
Keep it.

356
00:33:07,819 --> 00:33:10,322
Are you okay?
- Did you talk to anyone else?

357
00:33:10,655 --> 00:33:14,367
What happened at the News Center?
- lt was like they were expecting us.

358
00:33:14,701 --> 00:33:16,703
I got this bad feeling,
so I took off.

359
00:33:17,037 --> 00:33:19,998
But then they surrounded
the building and it's all out war.

360
00:33:20,832 --> 00:33:23,668
But you managed to sabotage
the broadcast feed, right?

361
00:33:24,044 --> 00:33:26,838
Like I said, it was too easy.
So we just left.

362
00:33:28,006 --> 00:33:29,466
Well, somebody did.

363
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,512
Maybe they did it themselves.

364
00:33:34,304 --> 00:33:36,014
As an excuse, like.

365
00:33:39,851 --> 00:33:41,645
You got to disappear for a while.

366
00:33:42,812 --> 00:33:44,439
Can't I just go to your house?

367
00:33:45,148 --> 00:33:47,901
I'm already under suspicion.
You know anyone else?

368
00:33:49,319 --> 00:33:53,490
I met this girl, Cecile. She's like 25
or something but I think she's ok.

369
00:33:54,032 --> 00:33:56,701
My associate, Cecile? She's reactionary.

370
00:33:57,202 --> 00:33:58,787
I think she's coming around.

371
00:33:59,788 --> 00:34:00,830
Really?

372
00:34:01,164 --> 00:34:03,041
We only spent
one night together.

373
00:34:03,375 --> 00:34:05,710
But I think she's beginning
to see the light.

374
00:34:06,044 --> 00:34:10,423
You spent the night with Cecile?
- Jack, call on line five.

375
00:34:13,885 --> 00:34:17,430
Okay. Find her. Give me a call
in a few days. Be careful.

376
00:34:22,852 --> 00:34:23,853
Yeah?

377
00:34:41,162 --> 00:34:42,455
Thank you for coming.

378
00:34:45,292 --> 00:34:46,459
What happened?

379
00:34:48,670 --> 00:34:51,798
I met this boy. I was upset.

380
00:34:55,468 --> 00:34:58,763
He took me to a party where people
make love because it feels good.

381
00:35:00,348 --> 00:35:01,766
Oh no, Cecile.

382
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,068
It looked bad for Cecile.

383
00:35:13,194 --> 00:35:15,739
I came down hard on William
for being so reckless.

384
00:35:17,073 --> 00:35:21,911
But after all he was my best operative.
I couldn't afford to scare him too much.

385
00:35:23,371 --> 00:35:26,291
What did I expect from
a seventeen-year-old, anyway?

386
00:35:27,375 --> 00:35:29,044
He was in it for the adventure.

387
00:35:29,753 --> 00:35:33,131
With a naturally high metabolism
the attention deficit remedies

388
00:35:33,465 --> 00:35:36,426
they gave him at school
had almost no effect.

389
00:35:37,135 --> 00:35:39,137
He was a natural born lady's man

390
00:35:39,471 --> 00:35:43,141
and had recruited
some of our most effective female spies.

391
00:35:43,892 --> 00:35:47,354
This court finds you guilty of engaging
in sexual activity

392
00:35:47,687 --> 00:35:51,191
that robs the revolution
of its right to your personal value,

393
00:35:51,524 --> 00:35:53,985
generating no income
for the common cause

394
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:55,945
the autonomy of the individual,

395
00:35:56,279 --> 00:35:59,115
a gross impedance
of human potential for progress,

396
00:35:59,449 --> 00:36:01,284
a blow against a thriving economy,

397
00:36:02,661 --> 00:36:06,164
an inconsiderate and perverse
insistence on one's own selflessness.

398
00:36:07,415 --> 00:36:11,920
You are sentenced to two years
hard labor teaching high school. Next.

399
00:37:00,176 --> 00:37:03,930
Because of the high incidence
of handgun-related violence in school,

400
00:37:04,264 --> 00:37:06,766
only convicts were assigned
teaching positions.

401
00:37:08,143 --> 00:37:11,646
Students were regularly sedated
with attention deficit remedies

402
00:37:11,980 --> 00:37:15,817
and learned most everything
through virtual reality play stations.

403
00:37:39,340 --> 00:37:42,343
Although everything imaginable
was available on the web,

404
00:37:42,802 --> 00:37:45,305
certain texts had disappeared.

405
00:37:53,313 --> 00:37:55,732
Interactivity and equal access
to information

406
00:37:56,065 --> 00:37:58,818
were the cornerstone
of the revolution's rhetoric,

407
00:37:59,152 --> 00:38:02,322
but no one seemed to notice,
or at least feel,

408
00:38:02,655 --> 00:38:07,702
the loss of expression officially deemed
malcontent, antisocial, and cynical.

409
00:38:12,916 --> 00:38:16,336
I knew. I was the architect
of the agency's Demographics

410
00:38:16,753 --> 00:38:18,588
and Target Marketing programs.

411
00:38:19,130 --> 00:38:22,884
The people were our targets
and we listened to their language.

412
00:38:23,218 --> 00:38:24,761
We monitored their dreams.

413
00:38:25,220 --> 00:38:28,515
We took note
of every choice they made in cyberspace.

414
00:38:29,098 --> 00:38:32,101
We studied their buying motives
and propensities,

415
00:38:32,560 --> 00:38:35,188
then created messages
that perfectly reflected

416
00:38:35,522 --> 00:38:37,565
their existing emotional states.

417
00:38:38,024 --> 00:38:41,069
No one could hide.
Triple M could recognize any citizen

418
00:38:41,402 --> 00:38:43,571
as soon as they
turned on their computer.

419
00:38:44,405 --> 00:38:45,657
The web would dynamically

420
00:38:45,990 --> 00:38:48,493
reconfigure itself
to suit that individual.

421
00:38:48,827 --> 00:38:50,537
Something you could hold,

422
00:38:50,870 --> 00:38:53,665
read on your own,
think about in private.

423
00:38:54,249 --> 00:38:58,628
This was considered elitist,
immoral and bad for business.

424
00:39:01,673 --> 00:39:03,591
"Such is the character
of that tomorrow

425
00:39:03,925 --> 00:39:06,386
which mere lapse of time
can never make till dawn.

426
00:39:07,303 --> 00:39:10,181
The light that puts out our eyes
is darkness to us.

427
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:13,476
Only that day dawns
to which we are awake."

428
00:39:25,905 --> 00:39:29,993
What is it?
- I just wanted to say I was sorry.

429
00:39:34,664 --> 00:39:35,999
Can you run an errand?

430
00:39:39,377 --> 00:39:42,213
Can you bring this book
to Convict 13K slash 2?

431
00:39:43,047 --> 00:39:45,967
Can she be trusted?
- Yes, she's my friend.

432
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:55,727
Maybe you should hide it on you.

433
00:40:02,692 --> 00:40:06,070
Convict 13K slash...?
- Rita Morales.

434
00:40:50,406 --> 00:40:51,783
No. Not like that.

435
00:40:57,789 --> 00:40:59,332
What's that in your pants?

436
00:41:19,644 --> 00:41:23,064
No, not like that.
- Here, you try it.

437
00:41:23,731 --> 00:41:25,942
No, really, I have to go.

438
00:41:38,663 --> 00:41:40,331
He made us do it.

439
00:41:55,346 --> 00:41:56,889
Where is it?

440
00:42:07,400 --> 00:42:08,985
13K slash 2.

441
00:42:12,280 --> 00:42:13,948
I'm not through with you yet.

442
00:42:31,966 --> 00:42:35,595
Did you make them do that?
- It was nice.

443
00:42:38,014 --> 00:42:42,060
Look, William, Martha and her friend
are not my responsibility. But you are.

444
00:42:42,935 --> 00:42:45,271
And I'm required to ask you
these questions.

445
00:42:48,316 --> 00:42:50,026
"Are you sexually active?"

446
00:42:54,280 --> 00:42:55,615
Go back to class.

447
00:43:33,027 --> 00:43:35,613
"The size and capacity
of the human brain

448
00:43:36,030 --> 00:43:38,866
seems to have made
its greatest increase

449
00:43:39,200 --> 00:43:43,162
in direct relation to the rigors
of the Earth's Ice Age."

450
00:43:52,588 --> 00:43:55,883
"Perhaps the evolution
of the need to think ahead,

451
00:43:56,217 --> 00:43:58,261
to plan, to wait,

452
00:43:58,678 --> 00:44:03,641
are attributable to survival
in these extreme conditions, crisis."

453
00:45:52,416 --> 00:45:53,668
You have to go back.

454
00:45:54,835 --> 00:45:56,587
There's nothing you can do here.

455
00:45:58,798 --> 00:46:02,176
I can't go back alone.

456
00:46:06,305 --> 00:46:09,100
She was the latest
in a long line of messengers

457
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,977
sent to retrieve an errant son;

458
00:46:11,310 --> 00:46:14,438
some small lost chunk of
their planet's collective intelligence.

459
00:46:15,231 --> 00:46:18,859
The longer she stayed the harder
it would be for her to go back.

460
00:46:19,610 --> 00:46:23,322
Many more before her had tried,
tried to go back,

461
00:46:23,864 --> 00:46:27,785
to walk back into the sea they had
once walked out of so easily,

462
00:46:28,494 --> 00:46:30,579
only to be washed back ashore crying

463
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:33,833
their first real human tears
of loss and regret.

464
00:46:40,548 --> 00:46:42,008
Open UP-

465
00:46:43,217 --> 00:46:44,719
Be one of us.

466
00:46:45,594 --> 00:46:46,929
Get ahead.

467
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:49,223
Be empowered.

468
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:52,059
Do things your own way.

469
00:46:53,644 --> 00:46:54,937
Take control.

470
00:46:55,855 --> 00:46:57,231
You're in charge.

471
00:46:58,691 --> 00:47:00,359
Be all you want to be.

472
00:47:01,819 --> 00:47:03,487
It's a whole wide world.

473
00:47:04,405 --> 00:47:05,656
The future.

474
00:47:07,658 --> 00:47:09,118
Welcome.
- Fuck off.

475
00:47:09,660 --> 00:47:12,121
Show me today's test scores.
History. Tenth grade.

476
00:47:12,455 --> 00:47:14,957
Class D. Fall semester. History.

477
00:47:15,291 --> 00:47:19,003
Exam 5. Student 1397: Janine Masters.

478
00:47:19,337 --> 00:47:22,923
Score: 37 percent. Student 1267:

479
00:47:23,257 --> 00:47:26,635
Robert Formosa. Score: 54 percent.

480
00:47:27,053 --> 00:47:32,016
Student 6478: Emily Chen.
Score: 63 percent.

481
00:47:32,350 --> 00:47:37,313
Student 7912:
Warren Cucarulo. Score: 12 percent.

482
00:47:37,897 --> 00:47:40,775
Student 1959:
William Hendrix.

483
00:47:41,108 --> 00:47:43,277
Score: 100 percent.

484
00:47:49,658 --> 00:47:51,827
Are you okay?
- Oh, yeah. I'm fine.

485
00:47:52,286 --> 00:47:53,537
What happened?

486
00:47:53,871 --> 00:47:58,000
Oh, nothing. He just threatened
to extend my sentence.

487
00:47:58,918 --> 00:48:02,838
Bastard.
- But he didn't. He didn't do it.

488
00:48:26,070 --> 00:48:27,113
Where is he?

489
00:48:29,907 --> 00:48:31,033
He's absent today.

490
00:48:35,454 --> 00:48:36,914
Let's check the lavatory.

491
00:49:34,472 --> 00:49:36,474
He's here somewhere.
He checked his gun.

492
00:49:37,600 --> 00:49:39,185
Bring the girl to my office.

493
00:49:51,780 --> 00:49:53,407
This was found in his locker.

494
00:49:55,618 --> 00:49:57,036
It's mine.

495
00:49:58,370 --> 00:50:00,539
Of course.
You'll be charged accordingly.

496
00:50:00,873 --> 00:50:02,374
That's not what concerns me.

497
00:50:02,791 --> 00:50:06,420
This kid, William, he's scored
100 percent on every test this semester.

498
00:50:06,754 --> 00:50:09,924
He's bright.
- Don't play dumb with me, 17B slash 8!

499
00:50:10,257 --> 00:50:12,009
Five.
- What? - 17B slash 5.

500
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:15,596
You know as well as I do
these tests are meant to screen out

501
00:50:15,930 --> 00:50:18,891
the smart kids and keep
the rest as dumb as possible!

502
00:50:19,225 --> 00:50:21,435
There's only
one explanation for William's

503
00:50:21,769 --> 00:50:24,688
breadth of knowledge and curiosity!
And you know it!

504
00:50:28,651 --> 00:50:29,944
What could she say?

505
00:50:31,320 --> 00:50:32,613
How could she tell?

506
00:50:33,322 --> 00:50:34,823
Maybe it was true.

507
00:50:36,242 --> 00:50:37,576
William was an immigrant.

508
00:50:39,912 --> 00:50:43,499
I had to. I'm sorry.
They were going to arrest him anyway.

509
00:50:44,041 --> 00:50:45,084
It's okay.

510
00:50:45,668 --> 00:50:48,754
They say he's the leader
of a terrorist youth group.

511
00:50:49,588 --> 00:50:53,008
He's wanted for rape.
He's an immigrant.

512
00:50:55,052 --> 00:50:57,137
Rita, William is not a rapist.

513
00:50:57,513 --> 00:51:00,349
They throw parties where
everyone takes sexual stimulants

514
00:51:00,683 --> 00:51:03,102
and make love without
generating market value.

515
00:51:04,019 --> 00:51:05,062
SQ?

516
00:51:05,729 --> 00:51:07,565
So, it undermines the whole system.

517
00:51:08,190 --> 00:51:10,985
Cecile, please don't talk like that.

518
00:51:11,318 --> 00:51:13,654
What is going on with you
and Principal Funk?

519
00:51:16,824 --> 00:51:19,410
We made a deal a while ago.

520
00:51:20,244 --> 00:51:25,040
In exchange for taking
two years off my sentence

521
00:51:25,374 --> 00:51:28,752
we increase his personal value.

522
00:51:29,795 --> 00:51:33,424
He's got connections
at the stock exchange.

523
00:51:34,842 --> 00:51:36,302
You mean you fuck him.

524
00:51:38,804 --> 00:51:40,222
He fucks me.

525
00:51:47,313 --> 00:51:48,480
Cecile.

526
00:51:54,653 --> 00:51:55,696
Up here.

527
00:52:05,122 --> 00:52:07,541
Hey. Come on. It's not too far to fall.

528
00:52:32,358 --> 00:52:36,904
Jack, we're gonna have to get a jump
on that soda pop campaign.

529
00:52:37,237 --> 00:52:40,157
The city's decided to move
the machines in tomorrow.

530
00:52:40,658 --> 00:52:42,868
We're gonna come
at it from a new angle.

531
00:52:43,202 --> 00:52:44,453
A "news" angle.

532
00:52:44,787 --> 00:52:47,623
Abercrombie, has this product
been checked out yet?

533
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:50,751
What do you mean by checked out?

534
00:52:51,085 --> 00:52:53,587
It's a high caffeine drink.
- So?

535
00:52:54,088 --> 00:52:56,757
Kids at school
are given attention deficit remedies.

536
00:52:57,091 --> 00:52:59,134
Are there no adverse side effects?

537
00:52:59,468 --> 00:53:02,388
How do I know, Jack?
It's what the people want.

538
00:53:03,555 --> 00:53:05,307
It's what Triple M wants.

539
00:53:05,641 --> 00:53:07,351
Triple M are the people, Jack.

540
00:53:07,810 --> 00:53:11,063
And don't take that high and mighty
naysayer tone with me.

541
00:53:13,607 --> 00:53:16,110
Look, we've had our eye on you.

542
00:53:20,656 --> 00:53:21,907
Thanks,Jack.

543
00:53:41,427 --> 00:53:44,763
Doc. It's me. Can I come over?

544
00:54:09,455 --> 00:54:10,831
This is Jack's place?

545
00:54:11,665 --> 00:54:12,708
Yes.

546
00:54:13,417 --> 00:54:14,752
And who are you?

547
00:54:17,254 --> 00:54:18,505
No Body.

548
00:54:33,103 --> 00:54:34,730
I'm not from around here.

549
00:54:39,943 --> 00:54:41,069
Can we talk?

550
00:54:47,785 --> 00:54:48,869
What's the latest?

551
00:54:49,661 --> 00:54:53,123
It's this soda.
It's likely to cause a reaction

552
00:54:53,457 --> 00:54:56,251
in kids under the influence
of attention deficit remedy.

553
00:54:56,919 --> 00:54:59,379
What kind of reaction?
- It's hard to say.

554
00:55:00,339 --> 00:55:01,715
I'll have this analyzed.

555
00:55:03,967 --> 00:55:05,385
How's our friend?

556
00:55:05,719 --> 00:55:06,762
Hidden.

557
00:55:07,179 --> 00:55:10,766
You know that if she stays here
long enough she'll be stuck.

558
00:55:11,266 --> 00:55:12,684
We've seen this before.

559
00:55:13,018 --> 00:55:15,813
There's nothing she can do,
for us at least.

560
00:55:18,565 --> 00:55:20,484
Can you convince her to go back?

561
00:55:24,863 --> 00:55:28,909
Maybe. If I can keep her
from seeing people.

562
00:55:31,119 --> 00:55:32,788
That's how it starts.

563
00:55:37,084 --> 00:55:38,627
Getting involved

564
00:55:39,545 --> 00:55:40,754
with people.

565
00:55:42,047 --> 00:55:45,551
Caring about them.
Mutual dependency, that kind of thing.

566
00:55:46,927 --> 00:55:48,262
Love.

567
00:55:49,137 --> 00:55:50,973
Eventually, there's no escape.

568
00:55:56,770 --> 00:55:58,564
Why have you come here, then?

569
00:55:58,897 --> 00:56:01,108
I was sent to bring my friend back.

570
00:56:02,651 --> 00:56:03,902
There are more like you?

571
00:56:05,279 --> 00:56:06,613
We are all one.

572
00:56:07,531 --> 00:56:11,326
But part of us once came
down here and he got lost.

573
00:56:12,619 --> 00:56:14,121
How long has he been here?

574
00:56:16,039 --> 00:56:17,332
In your time?

575
00:56:19,126 --> 00:56:20,252
Ten years.

576
00:56:21,587 --> 00:56:23,380
Before the revolution, then.

577
00:56:24,715 --> 00:56:26,592
We're afraid he's addicted.

578
00:56:27,676 --> 00:56:28,677
To what?

579
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:31,722
To being human.

580
00:56:35,517 --> 00:56:37,978
Jack, this is Cecile.

581
00:56:38,604 --> 00:56:40,647
She's an enemy of the consumer.

582
00:56:53,076 --> 00:56:55,662
Over there.
- The bright one in Orion?

583
00:56:56,580 --> 00:56:57,706
No, next to it.

584
00:56:59,041 --> 00:57:01,919
It looks small from here,
but it's really big.

585
00:57:07,799 --> 00:57:09,885
Here it is, Star 147X

586
00:57:10,218 --> 00:57:11,929
in the constellation Monday.

587
00:57:12,262 --> 00:57:13,472
That's it.

588
00:57:14,222 --> 00:57:17,017
That's home! Jack, look!

589
00:57:18,060 --> 00:57:21,271
It was too late, I thought.
She had made a friend.

590
00:57:22,648 --> 00:57:26,109
You're the girl from Monday.
- What does it mean?

591
00:57:27,277 --> 00:57:28,695
First day of the week.

592
00:57:30,614 --> 00:57:31,907
A new start.

593
00:57:44,962 --> 00:57:45,963
Monday.

594
00:57:54,012 --> 00:57:55,222
So, it's true.

595
00:57:55,555 --> 00:57:59,017
Star 147X is in contact
with the counter-revolutionaries.

596
00:57:59,518 --> 00:58:01,687
They're just searching
for one of their own.

597
00:58:02,020 --> 00:58:04,773
Some troublemaker who got lost
down here years ago.

598
00:58:05,107 --> 00:58:08,902
Isn't it possible he's part of
the resistance? You might have met him.

599
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:10,320
I guess.

600
00:58:17,661 --> 00:58:19,663
I never would have suspected you.

601
00:58:19,997 --> 00:58:22,374
I never would have guessed
you were a partisan.

602
00:58:24,960 --> 00:58:26,545
Does she always sleep this much?

603
00:58:27,921 --> 00:58:31,425
It's normal in the beginning.
What are you going to do?

604
00:58:31,758 --> 00:58:34,594
I want to be part of it.
I want to join the resistance.

605
00:58:35,345 --> 00:58:37,180
You don't have much of a choice.

606
00:58:37,514 --> 00:58:40,058
If Triple M catch you,
you'll go to the moon.

607
00:58:40,392 --> 00:58:42,227
You're a counter-revolutionary.

608
00:58:42,561 --> 00:58:45,689
I like it, though. The danger.
It feels good.

609
00:58:47,816 --> 00:58:50,277
Tell me what to do.
Give me a mission, Jack.

610
00:58:50,819 --> 00:58:53,905
Well, for now. Just stay here with her.

611
00:58:54,448 --> 00:58:56,366
I've got to check in
with operatives.

612
00:58:56,700 --> 00:58:57,868
NOW?

613
00:58:58,201 --> 00:59:00,954
Triple M is planning something big.
We have to hurry.

614
00:59:03,999 --> 00:59:05,751
Do I still have nice legs?

615
00:59:47,667 --> 00:59:48,794
Listen.

616
00:59:52,506 --> 00:59:53,840
They're only tears.

617
00:59:54,341 --> 00:59:55,425
Water.

618
00:59:55,842 --> 00:59:56,927
Look.

619
01:00:06,645 --> 01:00:08,146
It was a long night.

620
01:00:33,463 --> 01:00:35,048
Hello?
- Jack?

621
01:00:35,632 --> 01:00:37,592
Doc.
- I can't say much now.

622
01:00:38,135 --> 01:00:40,178
But get over here
as soon as you can.

623
01:01:03,076 --> 01:01:04,077
Hello?

624
01:01:05,620 --> 01:01:06,663
Cecile?

625
01:01:07,372 --> 01:01:08,373
William?

626
01:01:09,749 --> 01:01:12,043
I'm in trouble, I can't talk long.

627
01:01:12,377 --> 01:01:16,214
They're tracing my call, this could be
the last time I'm able to use my phone.

628
01:01:16,548 --> 01:01:18,884
I need you to meet me
behind the Indian place.

629
01:01:19,509 --> 01:01:22,095
Just go through the building
two doors up the street.

630
01:01:32,105 --> 01:01:33,356
We have a mission.

631
01:01:37,986 --> 01:01:39,321
See?
- Yeah.

632
01:01:40,697 --> 01:01:43,408
This drink combined
with the attention deficit remedy

633
01:01:43,742 --> 01:01:45,785
will make even
the most well-adjusted kid

634
01:01:46,119 --> 01:01:49,206
excitable, paranoid,
and probably violent.

635
01:01:49,539 --> 01:01:51,082
What are they trying to do?

636
01:01:51,416 --> 01:01:53,418
They're trying to stir up trouble.

637
01:01:55,587 --> 01:01:58,632
The citizens will be thankful
the state has put it to an end.

638
01:02:00,091 --> 01:02:01,218
But first...

639
01:02:02,093 --> 01:02:03,511
first, there must be terror.

640
01:02:03,845 --> 01:02:06,264
Maybe I can stop
the delivery of the machines.

641
01:02:06,723 --> 01:02:07,807
Jack.

642
01:02:22,405 --> 01:02:23,615
Thirty-five.

643
01:02:25,659 --> 01:02:26,743
Thank you.

644
01:02:27,911 --> 01:02:29,287
Now we need coats.

645
01:02:33,458 --> 01:02:34,501
Right.

646
01:02:34,834 --> 01:02:35,877
Boutique.

647
01:03:13,540 --> 01:03:14,541
Who is this?

648
01:03:15,709 --> 01:03:17,627
It's okay.
She's not from around here.

649
01:03:18,253 --> 01:03:19,296
Hi.

650
01:04:09,637 --> 01:04:12,265
Leave her be.
She won't get far without her barcode.

651
01:04:47,967 --> 01:04:49,803
That was a close call, Jack.

652
01:04:51,096 --> 01:04:52,931
If you had fouled up
this campaign,

653
01:04:53,264 --> 01:04:55,725
I doubt the CEO
would have been able to save you.

654
01:04:56,643 --> 01:04:58,186
Why are you saving me?

655
01:04:58,603 --> 01:04:59,813
Curiosity.

656
01:05:01,398 --> 01:05:04,943
You see, Jack, we've monitored
your existence here on Earth

657
01:05:05,276 --> 01:05:08,405
nearly since the day you arrived
from Star 147X.

658
01:05:12,325 --> 01:05:13,952
Yes, of course, we know.

659
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,163
We were with you at the beginning.

660
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:19,374
How does it go?

661
01:05:19,916 --> 01:05:21,793
The word becomes flesh.

662
01:05:22,752 --> 01:05:23,837
No.

663
01:05:24,379 --> 01:05:25,922
The body becomes...

664
01:05:27,632 --> 01:05:28,758
what?

665
01:05:37,475 --> 01:05:38,643
I don't know.

666
01:05:43,690 --> 01:05:44,774
We were there.

667
01:05:45,692 --> 01:05:47,819
We were there as you tried to go back.

668
01:05:48,153 --> 01:05:50,280
When you tried to go back
and you couldn't.

669
01:05:51,114 --> 01:05:53,074
That long walk back into the sea

670
01:05:53,700 --> 01:05:55,660
and the hope you'd be freed
of this...

671
01:05:56,786 --> 01:05:57,829
well, this...

672
01:05:58,246 --> 01:05:59,372
body.

673
01:06:03,168 --> 01:06:04,169
Regrets?

674
01:06:04,502 --> 01:06:06,045
Is that what bothers you, Jack?

675
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:08,798
You're killing innocents
to make a point.

676
01:06:09,132 --> 01:06:11,176
No. You give us too much credit.

677
01:06:12,093 --> 01:06:16,598
It's always the same with you
extraterrestrial types. Such idealists!

678
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:18,683
No.

679
01:06:19,017 --> 01:06:21,269
We are the revolution

680
01:06:21,769 --> 01:06:25,523
because we knew the revolution
was good for business.

681
01:06:26,441 --> 01:06:28,568
What we didn't anticipate was

682
01:06:28,902 --> 01:06:32,030
that even the counter-revolution
is good for business.

683
01:06:32,447 --> 01:06:35,783
The resistance is good for business.

684
01:06:40,663 --> 01:06:41,706
Now,

685
01:06:42,624 --> 01:06:44,292
if you had come to us sooner,

686
01:06:44,626 --> 01:06:47,003
or if you would have been
more frank about it,

687
01:06:47,629 --> 01:06:50,006
we could have gone
into business together.

688
01:06:50,340 --> 01:06:52,217
A sort of merger.

689
01:06:52,926 --> 01:06:54,177
But now it's too late.

690
01:06:55,220 --> 01:06:56,513
We're taking over.

691
01:06:57,138 --> 01:06:58,848
You partisans are too soft.

692
01:06:59,682 --> 01:07:01,184
What's a little killing?

693
01:07:01,726 --> 01:07:05,772
The people themselves, the consumers,
they can't get enough of it.

694
01:07:07,148 --> 01:07:08,650
We are what we eat.

695
01:07:10,193 --> 01:07:11,986
You're eating yourselves alive.

696
01:07:12,320 --> 01:07:13,530
And what's it to you?

697
01:07:14,113 --> 01:07:18,076
What do you really know about
being a human being, anyway, Jack?

698
01:07:20,537 --> 01:07:22,830
It's eat or be eaten.

699
01:07:24,916 --> 01:07:27,210
If you don't eat, you die.

700
01:07:37,845 --> 01:07:40,265
Cecile says that you should go home.

701
01:07:41,933 --> 01:07:43,643
I want to see Cecile.

702
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:48,523
Cecile says you should go home,
you should go all the way home.

703
01:07:51,734 --> 01:07:52,777
No.

704
01:07:57,615 --> 01:07:59,576
Cecile's in a lot of trouble, you know.

705
01:08:00,577 --> 01:08:03,413
But we're not barbarians.
There's such a thing as bail.

706
01:08:04,539 --> 01:08:06,666
Now, I know that you're an immigrant

707
01:08:07,000 --> 01:08:09,294
and that this is
an assumed body and all that.

708
01:08:09,627 --> 01:08:11,838
But perhaps we can help
each other anyway.

709
01:08:15,967 --> 01:08:18,344
I have connections
at the stock exchange

710
01:08:18,678 --> 01:08:23,558
that will allow you to substitute
for Cecile's personal human value.

711
01:08:27,770 --> 01:08:29,522
That is, if you're interested?

712
01:08:44,412 --> 01:08:46,748
Look, I'm not a political man.
I'm just greedy.

713
01:08:47,081 --> 01:08:49,834
I want to have sex
to increase the value of my stock.

714
01:08:50,168 --> 01:08:52,503
It's nothing personal.
I'm not a pervert.

715
01:08:53,504 --> 01:08:56,049
I know about sex.
- Good.

716
01:08:57,175 --> 01:09:00,219
The problem is that even
with a drawer full of Viagamon,

717
01:09:00,553 --> 01:09:03,097
I can't fuck you enough
to raise the capital needed

718
01:09:03,431 --> 01:09:05,850
to post Cecile's bail
and to save her from exile.

719
01:09:11,189 --> 01:09:12,482
We'll need help.

720
01:09:22,450 --> 01:09:26,037
“Let us spend one day
as deliberately as nature.

721
01:09:30,249 --> 01:09:33,628
And not be thrown off the track
by every nutshell

722
01:09:33,961 --> 01:09:36,881
and mosquito's wing
that falls upon the rail.

723
01:09:41,386 --> 01:09:43,388
Let us not be overwhelmed.

724
01:09:45,056 --> 01:09:47,809
Weather this danger and you are safe,

725
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:50,561
for the rest of the way is down hill.

726
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:57,485
If the engine whistles, let it whistle
till it is hoarse for its pains.

727
01:10:20,883 --> 01:10:23,845
If the bells ring, why should we run?

728
01:10:24,971 --> 01:10:27,807
We will listen to the music
they make instead.

729
01:10:34,856 --> 01:10:37,066
Let us settle ourselves

730
01:10:38,276 --> 01:10:41,237
and work and wedge our feet downward

731
01:10:41,738 --> 01:10:44,824
through the mud and slush of opinion.

732
01:10:48,494 --> 01:10:51,497
That alluvion which covers the globe.

733
01:10:51,831 --> 01:10:55,084
Till we come to a hard bottom and rocks

734
01:10:55,793 --> 01:10:58,337
in place, which we can call

735
01:11:00,006 --> 01:11:01,132
reality.”

736
01:11:28,284 --> 01:11:30,036
It was too late, anyway.

737
01:11:30,411 --> 01:11:33,956
Warden Funk was accused
and sentenced for insider trading.

738
01:11:34,457 --> 01:11:38,085
His assets were frozen and
he couldn't do anything to keep Cecile

739
01:11:38,419 --> 01:11:40,797
from being sent into exile on the moon.

740
01:12:26,759 --> 01:12:29,470
I tried to explain to her
the situation we were in.

741
01:12:41,524 --> 01:12:45,486
Triple M was interested in keeping
us alive merely as objects of study.

742
01:12:51,158 --> 01:12:52,952
But she had learned disgust.

743
01:12:55,580 --> 01:12:58,749
She had had enough of the body
and wanted to go home.

744
01:13:06,173 --> 01:13:07,508
It's not possible.

745
01:13:12,013 --> 01:13:13,431
I have to go home.

746
01:13:16,309 --> 01:13:17,560
You can't.

747
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,147
I will try.

748
01:13:23,941 --> 01:13:25,151
I've tried.

749
01:13:25,818 --> 01:13:26,903
I failed.

750
01:13:28,571 --> 01:13:29,822
You'll die.

751
01:13:31,407 --> 01:13:32,658
Maybe not.

752
01:13:40,166 --> 01:13:43,252
Your heart is too much here.

753
01:13:45,087 --> 01:13:46,130
Maybe.

754
01:13:50,635 --> 01:13:51,761
Come with me.

755
01:13:53,262 --> 01:13:54,263
Try.

756
01:13:55,222 --> 01:13:56,641
Maybe it will work,

757
01:13:57,308 --> 01:13:59,310
the two of us trying at once.

758
01:14:01,771 --> 01:14:02,813
No.

759
01:14:03,981 --> 01:14:05,399
L'll wait for Cecile.

760
01:14:05,942 --> 01:14:07,401
She'll be back one day.

761
01:14:10,988 --> 01:14:14,241
Besides, I'm more
human now than ever.

762
01:14:16,702 --> 01:14:17,912
I belong here.

763
01:14:20,247 --> 01:14:21,415
Deserve it, even.

764
01:15:22,476 --> 01:15:24,061
It's only water.

765
01:17:05,246 --> 01:17:07,081
I'll never know if she made it.

766
01:17:10,084 --> 01:17:11,293
But i hope.

767
01:17:13,337 --> 01:17:14,421
And I try.

768
01:17:16,173 --> 01:17:17,216
To resist.

769
01:17:20,136 --> 01:17:23,472
Even me, whom no one needs pity,

770
01:17:24,723 --> 01:17:26,350
even I can see this.

771
01:17:28,185 --> 01:17:29,353
Now.

772
01:17:30,396 --> 01:17:31,981
What humans do.

773
01:17:34,024 --> 01:17:35,109
Try.
