WHAT IN GOD’S NAME IS MAMA CARRYING ON ABOUT?

180
00:09:13,252 --> 00:09:14,554
ZACH!

181
00:09:14,554 --> 00:09:17,156
ZACH, YOU’VE GOT HELP CLINTON WITH ROBERT E.

182
00:09:17,156 --> 00:09:19,392
HE’S GONE CRAZY.

183
00:09:19,392 --> 00:09:20,826
[woman shouting]

184
00:09:20,826 --> 00:09:22,461
HE’S GONNA KILL CLINTON.

185
00:09:22,461 --> 00:09:24,030
(Clinton) WHOA!

186
00:09:24,030 --> 00:09:26,332
COME ON!

187
00:09:26,332 --> 00:09:28,568
[shouting]

188
00:09:28,568 --> 00:09:30,503
[camel growling]

189
00:09:30,503 --> 00:09:31,771
(Mary Joan) HONEY, BE CAREFUL, NOW.

190
00:09:31,771 --> 00:09:33,506
ALL RIGHT, COME ON, BOY.

191
00:09:33,506 --> 00:09:36,008
CALM DOWN, ROBERT E.

192
00:09:36,008 --> 00:09:37,076
[camel growling] GOD! GOD DAMN IT!

193
00:09:37,076 --> 00:09:38,244
(Zach) COME ON, BOY.

194
00:09:38,244 --> 00:09:40,212
STOP!

195
00:09:40,212 --> 00:09:42,448
JESUS, MARY AND JOSEPH! WHAT ARE YOU DOING?

196
00:10:15,648 --> 00:10:17,183
GOOD LORD, CLINTON.

197
00:10:17,183 --> 00:10:19,085
YOU COULD HAVE BEEN KILLED, HONEY.

198
00:10:19,085 --> 00:10:21,621
RIGHT BEFORE SPARTA DIED,

199
00:10:21,621 --> 00:10:23,889
ROBERT E. STARTED ACTING KIND OF FUNNY.

200
00:10:23,889 --> 00:10:26,058
THERE YOU GO.

201
00:10:26,058 --> 00:10:27,960
YEAH.

202
00:10:27,960 --> 00:10:30,997
HANK SAID HE’D BE BY LATER TO LOOK AT HIM.

203
00:10:30,997 --> 00:10:32,431
(man) MRS. WHIT?

204
00:10:32,431 --> 00:10:34,000
OH, THAT’S WALTER.

205
00:10:34,000 --> 00:10:35,668
(Zach) WALTER?

206
00:10:35,668 --> 00:10:38,571
I THOUGHT HE WAS AWAY AT THAT COLORED MEDICAL SCHOOL.

207
00:10:38,571 --> 00:10:40,406
(Murtis) IT SEEMS HE DIDN’T HAVE ENOUGH MONEY

208
00:10:40,406 --> 00:10:42,108
TO FINISH THE YEAR, SO HE’S WORKING SOME.

209
00:10:42,108 --> 00:10:43,542
HELLO?

210
00:10:43,542 --> 00:10:46,579
MAYBE THE BOY CAN COME VISIT US, YOU KNOW, LATER.

211
00:10:46,579 --> 00:10:49,348
AFTER ALL, WITH DINNER AND THE READING OF THE WILL...

212
00:10:49,348 --> 00:10:53,419
BUT I INVITED HIM HERE BECAUSE OF THE WILL.

213
00:10:53,419 --> 00:10:55,421
MR. CRAWFORD SAYS HE’S IN IT.

214
00:10:55,421 --> 00:10:57,823
Y’ALL WIPE YOUR FEET OFF. Y’ALL WIPE YOUR FEET OFF.

215
00:10:57,823 --> 00:10:59,492
COME ON IN.

216
00:10:59,492 --> 00:11:00,626
HEY, WALTER.

217
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,495
HEY, ZACH. HOW YOU DOING?

218
00:11:02,495 --> 00:11:04,030
OH, I’M ALL RIGHT.

219
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:05,631
I’M REALLY SORRY TO HEAR ABOUT MR. WHIT.

220
00:11:05,631 --> 00:11:07,099
YEAH, I APPRECIATE YOU BEING HERE, THOUGH.

221
00:11:07,099 --> 00:11:09,101
COME ON IN. WHEN DID YOU GET BACK FROM SCHOOL?

222
00:11:09,101 --> 00:11:10,770
(Walter) OH, A COUPLE MONTHS AGO.

223
00:11:10,770 --> 00:11:12,671
BEEN DRIVING A BALER-- YOU WIPE YOUR FEET.

224
00:11:12,671 --> 00:11:14,874
(Zach) BOY, THAT’S GOT TO BE ROUGH WITH ALL THAT HEAT WE GOT--

225
00:11:14,874 --> 00:11:16,542
[Clinton clears throat] WALTER, HOW ARE YOU?

226
00:11:16,542 --> 00:11:17,877
(Walter) OH, I’M DOING VERY WELL.

227
00:11:17,877 --> 00:11:19,912
THANK YOU, CLINTON.

228
00:11:19,912 --> 00:11:23,282
(Murtis) WALTER, YOU HAVE JUST GROWN INTO A MAN, HAVEN’T YOU?

229
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,884
NEW YORK?

230
00:11:24,884 --> 00:11:27,053
(Mary Joan) OH, YOU’VE BEEN TALKING TO ZACH.

231
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:28,521
YEAH, BUT NEW YORK?

232
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:31,090
OF ALL THE PLACES.

233
00:11:31,090 --> 00:11:34,093
I LOVE HIM, BUT HE DOESN’T HAVE A LICK OF SENSE IN HIS HEAD.

234
00:11:34,093 --> 00:11:36,462
HE’S STUBBORN AS ALL GET-GO.

235
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,531
EVEN WHEN HE WAS A CHILD,

236
00:11:38,531 --> 00:11:40,132
YOU COULD TAKE A SWITCH TO ZACH,

237
00:11:40,132 --> 00:11:42,168
AND HE’D TURN RIGHT AROUND AND--

238
00:11:42,168 --> 00:11:44,303
AND JUST RAISE CAIN ALL OVER AGAIN.

239
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,405
MURTIS, YOU KNOW I JUST IGNORE ZACH.

240
00:11:46,405 --> 00:11:49,341
OH! OH!

241
00:11:49,341 --> 00:11:50,743
ARE YOU OKAY?

242
00:11:50,743 --> 00:11:52,611
CHARLOTTE, I’M ALL RIGHT.

243
00:11:52,611 --> 00:11:53,979
ANYWAY, THE ONLY WAY

244
00:11:53,979 --> 00:11:55,448
WE’RE SEEING NEW YORK IS ON A TOUR BUS.

245
00:11:55,448 --> 00:11:57,316
I’VE DECIDED THAT. GOOD.

246
00:11:57,316 --> 00:11:59,785
YOU KNOW, THEY SAY THAT IN NEW YORK

247
00:11:59,785 --> 00:12:01,253
YOU CAN’T GO OUT AT NIGHT

248
00:12:01,253 --> 00:12:03,122
OR ELSE A NEGRO WILL JUMP OUT OF A SHADOW

249
00:12:03,122 --> 00:12:04,690
AND SHOOT YOU WITH A BIG OLD GUN.

250
00:12:04,690 --> 00:12:06,692
YOU KNOW, CHARLOTTE, I DON’T BELIEVE THAT’S TRUE.

251
00:12:06,692 --> 00:12:08,594
WELL, CLINTON TOLD ME SO.

252
00:12:08,594 --> 00:12:11,664
OOOH, THAT PECAN PIE LOOKS LOVELY. HA HA!

253
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:13,399
THANK YOU.

254
00:12:13,399 --> 00:12:15,468
OH, I DIDN’T KNOW WE WERE SUPPOSED TO BRING DESSERT.

255
00:12:15,468 --> 00:12:18,370
WE WEREN’T. I JUST DID IT LAST MINUTE.

256
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:19,905
(Charlotte) WELL, IF I’D HAVE KNOWN, I WOULD’VE BROUGHT MY MOUSSE.

257
00:12:19,905 --> 00:12:21,874
IT’S A THREE-CHOCOLATE MOUSSE.

258
00:12:21,874 --> 00:12:24,276
WELL, HONEY, YOU JUST BRING IT NEXT TIME.

259
00:12:24,276 --> 00:12:25,811
Y’ALL NEED ANY HELP?

260
00:12:25,811 --> 00:12:27,646
OH, NO, WE GOT IT COVERED.

261
00:12:29,515 --> 00:12:32,151
HAVE YOU HAD YOUR MEDICATION?

262
00:12:33,652 --> 00:12:36,589
TWICE, SO I’D BE DOUBLY SANE TONIGHT.

263
00:12:38,724 --> 00:12:41,460
HONEY, PLEASE DON’T-- DON’T DO THAT IN HERE.

264
00:12:41,460 --> 00:12:43,762
IT’S SO NICE, AND IT SMELLS LIKE PIE.

265
00:12:49,602 --> 00:12:51,637
(Clinton) POWER WINDOWS, LEATHER UPHOLSTERY,

266
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:54,073
THAT’S ALL WELL AND GOOD. THAT WILL PLEASE THE MISSUS.

267
00:12:54,073 --> 00:12:55,975
SHE WEREN’T BORN WITH MUCH, BLESS HER HEART,

268
00:12:55,975 --> 00:12:57,676
BUT SHE SURE HAS A TASTE FOR FINER THINGS.

269
00:12:57,676 --> 00:12:59,945
I TOLD HER, "YOU LISTEN..."

270
00:12:59,945 --> 00:13:04,316
NOW, YOU CLIMB ON IN THERE AND SIT IN THAT BUCKET SEAT.

271
00:13:04,316 --> 00:13:06,919
HUH? GOOD?

272
00:13:06,919 --> 00:13:08,988
IT’S NICE.

273
00:13:08,988 --> 00:13:10,589
(Clinton) YOU LIKE WHAT YOU SEE, WALTER?

274
00:13:10,589 --> 00:13:12,424
I SURE DO.

275
00:13:12,424 --> 00:13:13,859
WHAT’S THE MOST EXPENSIVE VEHICLE YOU’VE EVER DRIVEN IN?

276
00:13:13,859 --> 00:13:16,662
M48 TANK, CREW TWO, SOUTH SAIGON. [laughs]

277
00:13:16,662 --> 00:13:18,330
[camel bellowing]

278
00:13:18,330 --> 00:13:21,000
YOU KNOW, YOU OUGHT TO GET YOURSELF ONE OF THESE, ZACH.

279
00:13:21,000 --> 00:13:23,602
THEY’RE NOT THAT EXPENSIVE IF YOU DON’T GET ONE

280
00:13:23,602 --> 00:13:25,938
WITH ALL THE DOODADS IN THEM LIKE I HAVE.

281
00:13:25,938 --> 00:13:28,007
WELL, MARY JOAN’S BEEN AFTER ME

282
00:13:28,007 --> 00:13:29,808
SINCE I-CAN’T-REMEMBER TO GET HER ONE.

283
00:13:29,808 --> 00:13:32,444
I PROMISED HER, IF I TAKE THAT JOB UP IN NEW YORK, I’D SEE ABOUT IT.

284
00:13:32,444 --> 00:13:33,712
(Clinton) NEW YORK?

285
00:13:33,712 --> 00:13:35,714
THAT SEEMS LIKE THE END OF THE EARTH.

286
00:13:35,714 --> 00:13:37,216
ARE YOU SERIOUSLY CONSIDERING THAT?

287
00:13:37,216 --> 00:13:39,919
THERE’S A LOT OF OPPORTUNITY THERE.

288
00:13:39,919 --> 00:13:41,487
WELL, THAT COULD BE A GOOD PLAY, THOUGH--

289
00:13:41,487 --> 00:13:43,122
YOU GO UP NORTH AND WORK A COUPLE OF YEARS

290
00:13:43,122 --> 00:13:44,990
AND COME BACK HOME WITH A BETTER RESUME.

291
00:13:44,990 --> 00:13:48,394
YEAH, SOMETHING LIKE THAT.

292
00:13:48,394 --> 00:13:50,196
I FIGURE WE’D MAKE SOME MONEY

293
00:13:50,196 --> 00:13:52,665
AND MAYBE SET A LITTLE BIT ASIDE,

294
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,400
NOT LIKE YOU AND CHARLOTTE, OF COURSE,

295
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,268
BUT ENOUGH THAT I CAN INVEST A BIT IN THE STOCK MARKET.

296
00:13:56,268 --> 00:13:58,037
STOCK MARKET? I WOULDN’T MESS WITH THAT.

297
00:13:58,037 --> 00:13:59,538
IT’S AN AWFUL BAD TIME.

298
00:13:59,538 --> 00:14:01,740
YOU KNOW, THERE ARE A LOT OF SMART FELLAS

299
00:14:01,740 --> 00:14:03,709
WHO HAVE BEEN LOSING THEIR SHIRTS.

300
00:14:03,709 --> 00:14:05,644
IF I WERE YOU, I’D JUST, YOU KNOW, HOLD ON TO WHAT YOU GOT.

301
00:14:05,644 --> 00:14:07,346
YEAH, WELL, IF YOU DON’T RISK IT,

302
00:14:07,346 --> 00:14:08,914
YOU DON’T DRINK CHAMPAGNE.

303
00:14:08,914 --> 00:14:10,583
AND WHAT IF YOU’RE DADDY HADN’T RISKED DRILLING

304
00:14:10,583 --> 00:14:12,084
THAT OIL WELL OUT THERE?

305
00:14:12,084 --> 00:14:13,452
YOU KNOW, I’M GONNA TELL YOU SOMETHING.

306
00:14:13,452 --> 00:14:15,688
MONEY IS A FUNNY THING, ZACH.

307
00:14:15,688 --> 00:14:17,623
NOW, THERE’S SOME FELLAS, THEY’LL SPIT ON A SEED,

308
00:14:17,623 --> 00:14:21,060
THEY’LL GROW A FOREST, AND THEN YOU GOT OTHER FELLAS,

309
00:14:21,060 --> 00:14:23,963
THEY’LL TURN A GARDEN OF EDEN INTO A DESERT.

310
00:14:26,765 --> 00:14:29,201
YEAH, I RECKON SO.

311
00:14:44,650 --> 00:14:47,653
[faint eerie noises]

312
00:14:53,826 --> 00:14:55,728
[breathing deeply]

313
00:15:16,015 --> 00:15:18,951
[rattling noise]

314
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,158
[thunder booming]

315
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:32,498
(man) I’VE JUST GOT SOME UNFINISHED BUSINESS

316
00:15:32,498 --> 00:15:34,633
I’VE GOT TO LOOK AFTER HERE.

317
00:15:34,633 --> 00:15:36,702
JUST HANG ON, NOW.

318
00:15:36,702 --> 00:15:38,504
HI.

319
00:15:38,504 --> 00:15:40,205
[laughs] YOU DIDN’T THINK I’D LEAVE

320
00:15:40,205 --> 00:15:42,207
WITHOUT SAYING GOOD-BYE, DID YOU?

321
00:15:42,207 --> 00:15:44,576
YOU KNOW YOUR OLD GRANDPA BETTER THAN THAT.

322
00:15:44,576 --> 00:15:48,013
YOU LOOK NONE THE WORSE SINCE I LEFT.

323
00:15:48,013 --> 00:15:50,282
WISH I COULD SAY THE SAME FOR OLD ROBERT E.

324
00:15:51,617 --> 00:15:54,453
COME ON OVER HERE, WILL YA?

325
00:15:54,453 --> 00:15:56,722
THAT’S MY BOY.

326
00:15:56,722 --> 00:15:57,990
[laughs]

327
00:15:57,990 --> 00:16:00,426
ARE YOU SURPRISED TO SEE ME?

328
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,661
WELL, I’M FULL OF SURPRISES.

329
00:16:02,661 --> 00:16:04,396
LET’S GET STARTED.

330
00:16:04,396 --> 00:16:07,399
THERE’S SOME OLD FELLAS UPSTAIRS CHOMPIN’ AT THE BIT TO MEET YOU.

331
00:16:09,001 --> 00:16:11,070
UP WE GO, COME ON.

332
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:16,709
DAMN IT TO HELL!

333
00:16:18,777 --> 00:16:20,813
SORRY FOR MY LANGUAGE, BOY.

334
00:16:20,813 --> 00:16:24,149
I JUST WISH YOUR GRANDMOTHER WOULD STOP MESSIN’ WITH MY EAR.

335
00:16:24,149 --> 00:16:25,484
COME ON.

336
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:28,020
(man #1) THAT’S TEN, GRANDDAD.

337
00:16:28,020 --> 00:16:29,755
TELL HIM, DADDY.

338
00:16:29,755 --> 00:16:31,890
(man #2) YOU CAN’T PUT THAT DOWN THERE; TAKE THAT BACK.

339
00:16:31,890 --> 00:16:32,925
I SURE CAN. WHY CAN’T HE?

340
00:16:32,925 --> 00:16:35,794
WHY--TELL HIM, DAD.

341
00:16:35,794 --> 00:16:37,496
POP, YOU-- YOU TAUGHT HIM.

342
00:16:37,496 --> 00:16:39,131
(man #2) YEAH, I TAUGHT HIM,

343
00:16:39,131 --> 00:16:41,100
BUT I DIDN’T TEACH HIM TO CHEAT LIKE THAT, YOU KNOW?

344
00:16:41,100 --> 00:16:43,235
AND LIKE I’M GONNA PLAY THIS DOUBLE DEUCE RIGHT THERE.

345
00:16:43,235 --> 00:16:45,003
[laughs]

346
00:16:45,003 --> 00:16:46,939
WHOA, HE DOES IT TO US EVERY TIME.

347
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:48,741
THERE HE IS. THERE IS OUR BOY.

348
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:50,909
(man #2) THAT’S OUR BOY.

349
00:16:50,909 --> 00:16:52,745
LITTLE SPARTA,

350
00:16:52,745 --> 00:16:56,415
THIS HERE IS YOUR GREAT-GREAT-GREAT- GRANDDADDY, LUCAS,

351
00:16:56,415 --> 00:16:58,450
SHAKE IS HAND.

352
00:16:58,450 --> 00:16:59,918

00:36:10,067 --> 00:36:12,470
DID YOU KILL ANYONE IN VIETNAM?

711
00:36:15,740 --> 00:36:17,375
YES, MA’AM.

712
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:23,381
WHAT’D IT FEEL LIKE?

713
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:25,783
[laughs]

714
00:36:25,783 --> 00:36:29,320
WELL, UH... IT BOTHERED ME AT FIRST.

715
00:36:29,320 --> 00:36:31,189
IT BOTHERED ME A LOT.

716
00:36:31,189 --> 00:36:33,591
THEN I GUESS I KIND OF GOT USED TO IT.

717
00:36:33,591 --> 00:36:35,726
AND HOW’D YOU DO THAT?

718
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:39,897
WITH, UH--WELL, YOU’RE KIND OF TRAPPED

719
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:41,465
IN THE SITUATION, YOU KNOW?

720
00:36:41,465 --> 00:36:42,800
YOU CAN’T-- WALLED IN.

721
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:46,170
YEAH, WALLED IN, WALLED IN, ALL RIGHT.

722
00:36:48,472 --> 00:36:52,176
IT TAKES A WHILE TO FIGURE OUT THE WALLS AIN’T GONNA MOVE,

723
00:36:52,176 --> 00:36:54,645
BUT SOONER OR LATER, YOU FIND A WAY TO GET ON WITH IT.

724
00:36:57,014 --> 00:36:58,616
[laughs]

725
00:36:58,616 --> 00:36:59,951
WHEW.

726
00:36:59,951 --> 00:37:03,621
YOU AIN’T MUCH ON SMALL TALK, ARE YOU?

727
00:37:03,621 --> 00:37:07,491
I SAVE MY SMALL TALK FOR SMALL PEOPLE.

728
00:37:15,366 --> 00:37:17,335
[exhales]

729
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:27,211
DO YOU EVER FEEL LIKE IT’S STILL THERE,

730
00:37:27,211 --> 00:37:30,247
YOU KNOW, WHEN YOU’RE LYING IN YOUR BED

731
00:37:30,247 --> 00:37:34,218
OR WHEN YOU JUST FORGET YOURSELF?

732
00:37:34,218 --> 00:37:37,321
SOMETIMES THE FEELING COMES BACK.

733
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,724
THAT’S WHAT I THOUGHT.

734
00:37:39,724 --> 00:37:46,097
I THINK, WHEN YOU LOSE A PART OF YOURSELF LIKE THAT,

735
00:37:46,097 --> 00:37:48,466
SOMETHING STILL STAYS WITH YOU FOREVER.

736
00:37:50,468 --> 00:37:53,070
YEAH, YEAH, I GUESS YOU’RE RIGHT.

737
00:38:05,883 --> 00:38:09,253
YOU KNOW WHAT YOU SHOULD DO?

738
00:38:09,253 --> 00:38:11,222
WHAT?

739
00:38:13,224 --> 00:38:15,059
YOU SHOULD TAKE ME OUT TO THE PRAIRIE

740
00:38:15,059 --> 00:38:17,695
AND MAKE LOVE TO ME.

741
00:38:20,031 --> 00:38:22,033

742
00:38:22,033 --> 00:38:23,467
HA!

743
00:38:25,703 --> 00:38:27,171
YOUR TURN.

744
00:38:40,051 --> 00:38:41,585
WANT TO SWITCH RIFLES AGAIN?

745
00:38:41,585 --> 00:38:43,721
NO, I DON’T.

746
00:38:48,726 --> 00:38:50,027
THANK YOU.

747
00:38:53,064 --> 00:38:55,733
I SEE YOU OVER THERE, BOY.

748
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:58,703
IT’S TIME YOU LEARNED HOW TO FIRE A RIFLE.

749
00:38:58,703 --> 00:39:00,738
COME HERE, SPARTA.

750
00:39:00,738 --> 00:39:04,742
COME ON, LET’S GIVE IT A TRY.

751
00:39:04,742 --> 00:39:06,610
LET’S GO.

752
00:39:06,610 --> 00:39:08,979
ALL RIGHT, THIS WILL BE FUN.

753
00:39:08,979 --> 00:39:11,415
COME ON, GET UP HERE.

754
00:39:11,415 --> 00:39:12,883
ALL RIGHT, FIRST OFF,

755
00:39:12,883 --> 00:39:15,152
GET A GOOD STANCE, LIKE THAT, ALL RIGHT?

756
00:39:15,152 --> 00:39:18,789
NOW, WHENEVER ANYBODY HANDS YOU A GUN,

757
00:39:18,789 --> 00:39:20,958
YOU ALWAYS ASSUME THAT IT’S LOADED.

758
00:39:20,958 --> 00:39:22,526
YOU DON’T PUT YOUR FINGER ON THE TRIGGER

759
00:39:22,526 --> 00:39:24,462
UNTIL YOU’RE READY TO FIRE, OKAY?

760
00:39:24,462 --> 00:39:25,930
NOW, DON’T HOLD HER TOO TIGHT,

761
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:27,565
OR ELSE SHE’LL SHAKE WHEN YOU GO TO FIRE.

762
00:39:27,565 --> 00:39:30,801
OKAY, AND JUST RELAX.

763
00:39:30,801 --> 00:39:34,004
RELAX, OR ELSE YOU’RE GONNA MISS YOUR TARGET.

764
00:39:34,004 --> 00:39:37,041
OKAY, GET SOMETHING IN YOUR SIGHT.

765
00:39:39,844 --> 00:39:41,846
OPEN YOUR EYES UP.

766
00:39:41,846 --> 00:39:43,547
YOU GOT TO SEE YOUR TARGET.

767
00:39:43,547 --> 00:39:45,983
WHAT IF THAT WAS A DEER

768
00:39:45,983 --> 00:39:49,053
OR A BIRD OR SOMETHING, AND IT’S MOVING?

769
00:39:49,053 --> 00:39:50,888
ALL RIGHT.

770
00:39:50,888 --> 00:39:54,692
NOW, HOLD YOUR BREATH.

771
00:39:54,692 --> 00:39:56,894
OKAY, I’M GONNA COCK THE GUN FOR YA.

772
00:39:56,894 --> 00:40:01,565
[gun clicks]

773
00:40:01,565 --> 00:40:03,801
AND SQUEEZE THE TRIGGER.

774
00:40:06,570 --> 00:40:08,506
FIRE.

775
00:40:10,508 --> 00:40:13,344
FIRE.

776
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,912
GOD DAMN IT, FIRE.

777
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:16,580
[gunshot]

778
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,259
I JUST DON’T KNOW WHERE I WENT WRONG WITH THAT BOY.

779
00:40:29,527 --> 00:40:30,995
WELL...

780
00:40:30,995 --> 00:40:32,997
YOU KNOW HE NEEDS A HUG FROM HIS MOTHER

781
00:40:32,997 --> 00:40:35,533
JUST TO GET THE COURAGE TO BREATHE.

782
00:40:35,533 --> 00:40:37,301
SOMETIMES IT SEEMS LIKE HE’S AFRAID

783
00:40:37,301 --> 00:40:39,069
OF JUST ABOUT EVERYTHING.

784
00:40:41,806 --> 00:40:43,407
ALL I WANTED OUT OF THIS LIFE

785
00:40:43,407 --> 00:40:45,543
WAS A SON I COULD TAKE HUNTING AND FISHING.

786
00:40:45,543 --> 00:40:49,013
YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED THE LAST TIME WE WENT FISHING?

787
00:40:49,013 --> 00:40:51,916
I WENT TO BAIT WITH A LIVE NIGHT CRAWLER,

788
00:40:51,916 --> 00:40:54,018
AND HE UPS AND STARTS SCREAMING AND CRYING,

789
00:40:54,018 --> 00:40:56,887
AND HE BEGS ME NOT TO PUT IT ON A HOOK.

790
00:40:56,887 --> 00:41:00,024
IT’S THERE CORKSCREWING IN MY HAND,

791
00:41:00,024 --> 00:41:01,859
AND HE’S OVER THERE CRYING OVER IT,

792
00:41:01,859 --> 00:41:03,928
CRYING OVER A WORM.

793
00:41:06,464 --> 00:41:08,532
I’VE LOST A LOT OF SLEEP OVER IT,

794
00:41:08,532 --> 00:41:10,935
AND I STILL CAN’T FIGURE OUT

795
00:41:10,935 --> 00:41:13,404
HOW HE GOT SO GODDANG SENSITIVE.

796
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,873
AND I TELL MARY JOAN NOT TO PUT UP WITH IT.

797
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:17,508
SHE’S BEEN TO THAT WOMAN’S COLLEGE,

798
00:41:17,508 --> 00:41:19,610
AND SHE READ ALL THEM CHILD PSYCHOLOGY BOOKS,

799
00:41:19,610 --> 00:41:22,546
SO SHE THINKS SHE KNOWS EVERYTHING ABOUT EVERYTHING.

800
00:41:25,382 --> 00:41:28,152
IT AIN’T EVEN LIKE HAVING A SON.

801
00:41:28,152 --> 00:41:30,321
OH, YOU’RE WRONG THERE, ZACH.

802
00:41:30,321 --> 00:41:32,156
YOU’RE WRONG.

803
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:34,124
HE’S A FINE BOY.

804
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,527
YOU OUGHT TO BE PROUD OF HIM.

805
00:41:36,527 --> 00:41:39,597
HE’LL STRAIGHTEN UP.

806
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,565
HE’LL TURN OUT JUST FINE.

807
00:41:43,834 --> 00:41:46,837
BESIDES, THERE’S MORE TO LIFE THAN BAITING A HOOK

808
00:41:46,837 --> 00:41:48,873
OR SHOOTING A DANG GUN.

809
00:41:48,873 --> 00:41:50,574
NO, BUT IT’S A SYMPTOM.

810
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,109
IT’S A SYMPTOM.

811
00:41:52,109 --> 00:41:56,513
YOU KNOW HOW SHARP LIFE’S TEETH ARE.

812
00:41:56,513 --> 00:42:00,117
I JUST DON’T WANT TO SEE MY BOY EATEN UP, THAT’S ALL.

813
00:42:02,653 --> 00:42:05,556
[gunshot]

814
00:42:05,556 --> 00:42:07,391
(Sparta) HEY, PARTNER.

815
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:10,995
HOP IN.

816
00:42:23,040 --> 00:42:26,410
THAT GUN SCARES YOU, DON’T IT?

817
00:42:26,410 --> 00:42:28,679
BUT THE GUN CAN’T SHOOT ITSELF.

818
00:42:28,679 --> 00:42:31,315
SOMEBODY’S GOT TO PULL THE TRIGGER, DON’T THEY?

819
00:42:33,050 --> 00:42:35,953
THEN IT AIN’T THE GUN THAT’S GOT YOU SCARED, IS IT?

820
00:42:38,222 --> 00:42:40,691
SO WHAT ALL YOU THINK YOU MIGHT DO ABOUT IT?

821
00:42:43,093 --> 00:42:44,528

SOUNDS TO ME LIKE THAT TREE GOT A HAINT ON IT.

1236
01:07:21,437 --> 01:07:23,639
[scoffs]

1237
01:07:23,639 --> 01:07:26,776
IF I WERE YOU, I’D...

1238
01:07:26,776 --> 01:07:29,278
I’D CUT THE DANG THING DOWN.

1239
01:07:44,760 --> 01:07:47,696
LESS THAN THIS IF YOU WANT TO WIN.

1240
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,144
[thumps]

1241
01:08:07,616 --> 01:08:09,185
WELL, YOU’RE LUCKY.

1242
01:08:09,185 --> 01:08:13,889
IT’S JUST A PIECE OF YOUR TOE, NO STITCHES.

1243
01:08:13,889 --> 01:08:17,293
I’LL SEE IF I CAN’T DIG UP A FIRST AID KIT.

1244
01:08:17,293 --> 01:08:19,862
TRUNK OF MY CADDY. HERE ARE THE KEYS.

1245
01:08:19,862 --> 01:08:22,865
ALL RIGHT, BE BACK IN NO TIME.

1246
01:08:50,626 --> 01:08:52,695
YOU WANT TO EXPLAIN THIS, CLINTON?

1247
01:08:55,431 --> 01:08:58,367
(Clinton) THIS IS MY HOME.

1248
01:09:00,870 --> 01:09:04,540
WELL, THIS IS WHERE CHARLOTTE AND I LIVE.

1249
01:09:04,540 --> 01:09:06,375
I GOT NOTHING.

1250
01:09:08,544 --> 01:09:10,980
WELL, WHAT ABOUT THEM OIL RIGS OUT THERE?

1251
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,384
YOU EVER SEE THEM PUMPING?

1252
01:09:17,520 --> 01:09:20,022
THE DAMN THINGS DRIED UP ON ME.

1253
01:09:20,022 --> 01:09:22,791
I JUST CAN’T BELIEVE THIS, CLINTON.

1254
01:09:22,791 --> 01:09:24,093
[laughs]

1255
01:09:24,093 --> 01:09:26,328
I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING IT MYSELF.

1256
01:09:28,330 --> 01:09:31,867
NO SAVINGS?

1257
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,869
STOCK MARKET.

1258
01:09:33,869 --> 01:09:35,804
LOST EVERYTHING TRYING TO WIN IT BACK.

1259
01:09:38,908 --> 01:09:40,576
YOU GOT ENOUGH TO LIVE?

1260
01:09:40,576 --> 01:09:42,111
YEAH, WELL,

1261
01:09:42,111 --> 01:09:45,147
NOT COUNTING WHAT I LOST TO YOU SHOOTING,

1262
01:09:45,147 --> 01:09:49,985
I GOT PROBABLY A WEEK TILL TUESDAY.

1263
01:09:49,985 --> 01:09:52,221
WE WERE HOPING OLD SPARTA WOULD, YOU KNOW,

1264
01:09:52,221 --> 01:09:54,223
LEAVE US SOMETHING IN HIS WILL, BUT, YOU KNOW,

1265
01:09:54,223 --> 01:09:57,059
IT JUST WASN’T MEANT TO BE, SO...

1266
01:09:57,059 --> 01:10:00,029
AT LEAST YOU DON’T HAVE ANY KIDS TO FEED.

1267
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:06,502
YEAH, I GUESS WE CAN BE THANKFUL FOR THAT.

1268
01:10:11,941 --> 01:10:14,577
I AIN’T GONNA TELL ANYBODY ABOUT THIS, CLINTON,

1269
01:10:14,577 --> 01:10:16,845
NOT EVEN MARY JOAN.

1270
01:10:16,845 --> 01:10:19,448
WELL, I APPRECIATE THAT, ZACH.

1271
01:10:22,351 --> 01:10:26,288
WELL, LET’S WRAP THAT UP AND FINISH THAT COFFIN,

1272
01:10:26,288 --> 01:10:29,058
MR. TOE-TICKLING CHAMPION.

1273
01:11:27,750 --> 01:11:29,385
COME ON, GIMPY.

1274
01:11:29,385 --> 01:11:31,620
IF WE GET DRUNK NOW, WE CAN STILL BE SOBER

1275
01:11:31,620 --> 01:11:34,089
IN TIME TO TAKE CARE OF ROBERT E.

1276
01:11:34,089 --> 01:11:36,158
[laughs]

1277
01:11:42,631 --> 01:11:45,567
[saw scraping]

1278
01:12:07,256 --> 01:12:09,825
HEY, DON’T YOU THINK 6:00 IN THE MORNING

1279
01:12:09,825 --> 01:12:11,794
IS A LITTLE EARLY FOR PRUNING?

1280
01:12:13,662 --> 01:12:15,798
YOU KNOW, CUTTING IT DOWN IS NOT GONNA CHANGE ANYTHING.

1281
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,335
YOU MEAN, IT WON’T CHANGE ANYTHING FOR YOU,

1282
01:12:20,335 --> 01:12:23,439
BUT FOR ME, IT’S GONNA DO A WORLD OF GOOD.

1283
01:12:26,008 --> 01:12:27,943
JUST OUT OF CURIOSITY, MARY JOAN,

1284
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:30,346
WHEN ARE YOU GONNA FORGIVE ME?

1285
01:12:30,346 --> 01:12:33,382
I CAN’T FORGIVE YOU. ONLY GOD CAN DO THAT.

1286
01:12:33,382 --> 01:12:35,284
I’M NOT TALKING ABOUT THE BABY.

1287
01:12:35,284 --> 01:12:37,119
I WANT TO KNOW WHEN YOU’RE GONNA FORGIVE ME

1288
01:12:37,119 --> 01:12:39,021
FOR MY REAL SIN.

1289
01:12:39,021 --> 01:12:40,789
YOU’RE NOT MAKING ANY SENSE.

1290
01:12:40,789 --> 01:12:43,225
NOW, COME ON IN THE HOUSE AND GET SOME SLEEP.

1291
01:12:43,225 --> 01:12:46,662
YOU’VE ALWAYS HATED ME, LONG BEFORE THE ABORTION.

1292
01:12:46,662 --> 01:12:48,697
DON’T WASTE OUR TIME DENYING IT.

1293
01:12:48,697 --> 01:12:50,766
ALL RIGHT, YOU’RE NOT MY TYPE.

1294
01:12:50,766 --> 01:12:53,402
AND WHY IS IT, EXACTLY, YOU THINK THAT IS,

1295
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:55,471
THAT YOU DON’T LIKE ME?

1296
01:12:55,471 --> 01:12:56,972
MIRANDA, I DON’T KNOW.

1297
01:12:56,972 --> 01:12:59,141
IT’S NOT SOMETHING CONCRETE

1298
01:12:59,141 --> 01:13:00,676
THAT I CAN PUT MY FINGER ON RIGHT NOW.

1299
01:13:00,676 --> 01:13:02,378
’CAUSE I WAS SO PRETTY.

1300
01:13:02,378 --> 01:13:05,447
THAT’S MY SIN, AND THAT MADE YOU JEALOUS,

1301
01:13:05,447 --> 01:13:08,450
’CAUSE ALL YOUR LIFE, YOU PLAYED BY THE RULES,

1302
01:13:08,450 --> 01:13:10,219
BUT ON A HOT SUMMER NIGHT,

1303
01:13:10,219 --> 01:13:13,455
THE BOYS DIDN’T EXACTLY GO LOOKING FOR NICE GIRLS.

1304
01:13:13,455 --> 01:13:15,257
WELL, MARY JOAN,

1305
01:13:15,257 --> 01:13:19,294
MAYBE IT SEEMS TO YOU THAT I HAVE DANCED WITH THE SERPENT,

1306
01:13:19,294 --> 01:13:23,132
THAT I HAVE OFFENDED THE MORAL CODE AND SANCTITY

1307
01:13:23,132 --> 01:13:25,634
OF THIS GODFORSAKEN STRETCH OF PRAIRIE,

1308
01:13:25,634 --> 01:13:27,336
BUT I HAVE PAID A VERY HIGH PRICE

1309
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:30,239
FOR WHATEVER I’M SUPPOSED TO HAVE DONE TO Y’ALL,

1310
01:13:30,239 --> 01:13:31,840
AND MAYBE THAT AIN’T GOOD ENOUGH FOR YOU.

1311
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:35,744
MAYBE YOU WANT ME TO TAKE MY LIFE

1312
01:13:35,744 --> 01:13:39,448
TO ATONE FOR TAKING THAT INDIAN BOY’S SEED.

1313
01:13:39,448 --> 01:13:41,817
WELL, I’LL LOOK YOU STRAIGHT IN THE EYE,

1314
01:13:41,817 --> 01:13:44,553
AND I’LL TELL YOU I WILL NOT SPEND THE REST OF MY LIFE

1315
01:13:44,553 --> 01:13:46,889
ROTTING AWAY IN THAT ASYLUM,

1316
01:13:46,889 --> 01:13:48,857
WAITING FOR YOUR FORGIVENESS.

1317
01:13:48,857 --> 01:13:51,794
SO THAT TREE IS COMING DOWN,

1318
01:13:51,794 --> 01:13:54,096
AND I’M GONNA PULL OUT ANYTHING BAD

1319
01:13:54,096 --> 01:13:56,131
THAT’S GROWN IN MY HEART

1320
01:13:56,131 --> 01:13:59,067
UNTIL I’M ABLE TO COME OUT AND START LIVING AGAIN.

1321
01:14:00,936 --> 01:14:02,437
YOU GIVE ME THAT SAW.

1322
01:14:02,437 --> 01:14:04,306
I DON’T THINK SO.

1323
01:14:04,306 --> 01:14:05,707
I SAID GIVE IT TO ME-- YOU GIVE--

1324
01:14:05,707 --> 01:14:07,509
OH!

1325
01:14:07,509 --> 01:14:10,579
I ONLY GIVE THINGS UP TO BOYS, MARY JOAN, DON’T YOU KNOW?

1326
01:14:10,579 --> 01:14:13,115
YOU WANT IT? YOU TAKE IT, OKAY, HONEY?

1327
01:14:13,115 --> 01:14:14,683
THESE ARE MY NEW SLIPPERS.

1328
01:14:14,683 --> 01:14:18,053
NOW, YOU GO AHEAD AND GIVE IT TO ME.

1329
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,255
YOU’RE BEHAVING LIKE A CHILD, AND YOU’RE GONNA GET HURT.

1330
01:14:20,255 --> 01:14:22,257
YES, I AM.

1331
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:25,460
MIRANDA, GIVE ME THE SAW.

1332
01:14:25,460 --> 01:14:27,362
I’M LIKE ONE OF THOSE SAVAGES YOU SEE

1333
01:14:27,362 --> 01:14:28,797
IN THE NATIONAL GEOGRAPHIC.

1334
01:14:28,797 --> 01:14:30,699
YOU WANT TO COMMUNICATE WITH ME?

1335
01:14:30,699 --> 01:14:33,635
THEN YOU’VE GOT TO DESCEND TO MY PRIMITIVE,

1336
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:36,638
CARNAL, SINFUL LEVEL.

1337
01:14:36,638 --> 01:14:37,673
UHH!

1338
01:14:43,145 --> 01:14:44,079
AAH!

1339
01:14:47,416 --> 01:14:50,352
[both screaming]

1340
01:14:53,288 --> 01:14:55,057
OH, LORD.

1341
01:14:59,161 --> 01:15:01,496
MIRANDA, MARY JOAN!

1342
01:15:03,165 --> 01:15:05,033
OHH! [gasps]

1343
01:15:06,368 --> 01:15:08,670
[grunting]

1344
01:15:12,641 --> 01:15:14,509
[laughs]

1345
01:15:14,509 --> 01:15:16,144
[laughter]

1346
01:15:24,553 --> 01:15:27,556
[sobbing]

1347
01:15:31,960 --> 01:15:34,062
(Mary Joan) MIRANDA, WHAT IS IT?

1348
01:15:34,062 --> 01:15:36,531
I DIDN’T HAVE ANY ABORTION.

1349
01:15:38,400 --> 01:15:40,903
BUT I ABORTED MY BABY...

1350
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:47,109
IN HERE.

1351
01:15:49,011 --> 01:15:51,813
IN HERE, I ABORTED MY BABY.

1352
01:15:51,813 --> 01:15:54,449
I PLANNED ON GOING TO THE CITY AND HAVING IT DONE,

1353
01:15:54,449 --> 01:15:57,386
ONLY GOD BEAT ME TO IT.

1354
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:05,227
IT JUST FLOWED OUT OF ME.

1355
01:16:07,229 --> 01:16:11,767
PART OF ME DIED,

1356
01:16:11,767 --> 01:16:14,269
AND IT HURT.

1357
01:16:14,269 --> 01:16:18,307
IT HURT LIKE I’VE NEVER, EVER BEEN HURT.

1358
01:16:20,409 --> 01:16:22,244
MIRANDA, WHY WOULD YOU SAY

1359
01:16:22,244 --> 01:16:26,515
THAT YOU HAD AN ABORTION WHEN YOU HAD A MISCARRIAGE?

1360
01:16:26,515 --> 01:16:29,418
BECAUSE I DIDN’T.

1361
01:16:29,418 --> 01:16:33,488
IN MY HEART, I KILLED MY BABY.

1362
01:16:34,890 --> 01:16:37,859
THAT’S WHY GOD TOOK HIM.

1363
01:16:37,859 --> 01:16:39,928
WE CAN’T LIE TO GOD.

1364
01:16:39,928 --> 01:16:41,630
YOU WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND, MARY JOAN.

1365
01:16:41,630 --> 01:16:43,799
YOU JUST WOULDN’T UNDERSTAND.

1366
01:16:47,336 --> 01:16:50,639
I TRIED TO HOLD IT.

1367
01:16:50,639 --> 01:16:53,675
I JUST KEPT WONDERING IF GOD WAS PUNISHING ME,

1368
01:16:53,675 --> 01:16:56,611
PUNISHING ME FOR LOVING THAT BOY,

1369
01:16:56,611 --> 01:16:59,481
FOR GIVING HIM ALL THE LOVE I HAD.

1370
01:16:59,481 --> 01:17:03,952
HE’S NOT PUNISHING YOU, MIRANDA.

1371
01:17:03,952 --> 01:17:07,255
AND IF HE IS, WELL...

1372
01:17:07,255 --> 01:17:10,425
THEN HE’S AN ASSHOLE.

1373
01:17:10,425 --> 01:17:14,196
OH, LORD. AM I GONNA GO TO HELL FOR SAYING THAT?

1374
01:17:14,196 --> 01:17:17,165
ONLY IF GOD REALLY IS AN ASSHOLE, HONEY.

1375
01:17:17,165 --> 01:17:23,572
[laughter]

1376
01:17:23,572 --> 01:17:27,242
COME ON. 12?

1377
01:17:27,242 --> 01:17:29,244
12, MY BUTT.

1378
01:17:29,244 --> 01:17:31,513
SWEAR TO GOD.

1379
01:17:31,513 --> 01:17:32,914
MY BUTT.

1380
01:17:32,914 --> 01:17:35,917
SWEAR TO GOD.

1381
01:17:35,917 --> 01:17:37,819
GOD. WELL...

1382
01:17:37,819 --> 01:17:39,988
I DIDN’T DO IT UNTIL I WAS 16.

1383
01:17:39,988 --> 01:17:41,623
I’M SORRY FOR YOU.

1384
01:17:41,623 --> 01:17:44,559
[both laugh]

1385
01:17:44,559 --> 01:17:45,794
WHO WITH?

1386
01:17:47,929 --> 01:17:49,331
JENNY.

1387
01:17:49,331 --> 01:17:51,833
THE MAID? YES, SIR.

1388
01:17:51,833 --> 01:17:53,802
WHEW.

1389
01:17:53,802 --> 01:17:57,172
YES, SIR, AND SHE WAS SWEET AS PEACH PIE.

1390
01:17:57,172 --> 01:17:59,474
[both laughing]

1391
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:03,912
THERE I WAS.

1392
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:08,683
I WAS ORGANIZING MY SHOE TREE,

1393
01:18:08,683 --> 01:18:13,355
AND THEN I--I FELT THIS BIG OLD WET LIP

1394
01:18:13,355 --> 01:18:15,057
RIGHT ON MY EAR.

1395
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:16,725
AHH.

1396
01:18:16,725 --> 01:18:19,695
AND BOOM, BANG-- I WAS A MAN.

1397
01:18:19,695 --> 01:18:22,330
[both laughing]

1398
01:18:22,330 --> 01:18:24,533
THAT MUST’VE BEEN GREAT.

1399
01:18:24,533 --> 01:18:27,402
HELL NO. I WAS SCARED TO DEATH.

1400
01:18:27,402 --> 01:18:30,138
AND THEN WHEN MY MAN-ROOT GOT SWOLLEN.

1401
01:18:30,138 --> 01:18:33,041
[both laughing]

1402
01:18:33,041 --> 01:18:35,043
I THOUGHT I HAD TETANUS!

1403
01:18:35,043 --> 01:18:36,611
[laughter]

1404
01:18:36,611 --> 01:18:38,246
I DIDN’T KNOW WHAT WAS GOIN’ ON.

1405
01:18:38,246 --> 01:18:40,015
SHE WENT FOR THE EAR, HUH?

1406
01:18:40,015 --> 01:18:43,085
IT’S THE DAMNEDEST THING.

1407
01:18:43,085 --> 01:18:44,453
YOU KNOW WHAT?

1408
01:18:44,453 --> 01:18:46,054
