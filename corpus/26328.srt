1
00:00:33,880 --> 00:00:35,438
Went through the crack--

2
00:00:35,482 --> 00:00:38,007
Our twelfth edition of
the Psychic Friends Network--

3
00:00:38,051 --> 00:00:39,018
Shea Stadium--

4
00:00:41,054 --> 00:00:43,420
You're watching TV Time...

5
00:00:43,457 --> 00:00:45,186
the only network
playing lots of old stuff...

6
00:00:45,225 --> 00:00:47,420
in nothing but black and white.

7
00:00:48,962 --> 00:00:51,863
Why, it's fun
for the whole family!

8
00:00:51,898 --> 00:00:55,959
TV Time--
remember, you're soaking in it.

9
00:00:56,002 --> 00:00:58,470
This Friday on TV Time...

10
00:00:58,505 --> 00:01:01,633
Take the phone off the hook
and the plastic off the couch.

11
00:01:01,842 --> 00:01:05,608
That's right,
it's the Pleasantville marathon!

12
00:01:05,645 --> 00:01:10,548
24 hours chocked full
of pure family values.

13
00:01:10,584 --> 00:01:12,108
Featuring the warm greeting...

14
00:01:12,152 --> 00:01:13,619
Honey, I'm home.

15
00:01:13,653 --> 00:01:15,120
Proper nutrition...

16
00:01:15,155 --> 00:01:16,213
Do you want some more cookies?

17
00:01:16,256 --> 00:01:19,282
And, of course, safe sex.

18
00:01:19,326 --> 00:01:21,261
Why, it's a scrapbook...

19
00:01:21,261 --> 00:01:23,388
of all your favorite
Pleasantville memories.

20
00:01:23,430 --> 00:01:25,265
There's
"Trouble At The Barbershop..."

21
00:01:25,265 --> 00:01:27,290
"Fireman For a Day..."

22
00:01:27,334 --> 00:01:28,460
"The Big Game..."

23
00:01:28,502 --> 00:01:31,164
And who could forget
"Bud Gets a Job"?

24
00:01:31,204 --> 00:01:32,606
So join all your favorites...

25
00:01:32,606 --> 00:01:34,403
Mary Sue, Bud, George,
and Betty...

26
00:01:34,441 --> 00:01:37,535
and oh, yes, Mr. Johnson
at the soda shop.

27
00:01:37,577 --> 00:01:38,908
But wait, there's more!

28
00:01:38,945 --> 00:01:40,503
If you put
your thinking caps on...

29
00:01:40,547 --> 00:01:43,539
you could win $1,000 in our
Pleasantville trivia contest...

30
00:01:43,583 --> 00:01:46,518
plus a free trip to the
Pleasantville of your choice.

31
00:01:46,553 --> 00:01:50,455
Flash-back
to kinder, gentler times...

32
00:01:50,490 --> 00:01:52,253
on the Pleasantville marathon...

33
00:01:52,292 --> 00:01:55,523
this Friday only on...

34
00:02:17,684 --> 00:02:18,946
I mean, hi.

35
00:02:18,985 --> 00:02:21,351
Look,
you probably don't think...

36
00:02:21,388 --> 00:02:23,549
I should be asking you this.

37
00:02:23,590 --> 00:02:25,524
I mean,
not knowing you well and all.

38
00:02:26,927 --> 00:02:32,024
I--I mean, I know you.
Everybody knows you.

39
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,590
I just don't know you...
technically.

40
00:02:37,170 --> 00:02:39,968
Anyhow...

41
00:02:40,006 --> 00:02:42,167
I don't know what you're doing
this weekend...

42
00:02:42,209 --> 00:02:44,609
but my mom's leaving town...

43
00:02:44,644 --> 00:02:48,205
and she's letting me borrow
the car, so, you know...

44
00:02:57,624 --> 00:03:00,457
Okey-dokey,
so just give me a call.

45
00:03:00,494 --> 00:03:01,620
Let me know.

46
00:03:03,129 --> 00:03:05,290
Bye.

47
00:03:05,332 --> 00:03:07,459
For those of you going on
to college next year...

48
00:03:07,501 --> 00:03:09,332
the chance of finding
a good job...

49
00:03:09,369 --> 00:03:13,135
will actually decrease
by the time you graduate.

50
00:03:13,173 --> 00:03:15,004
The available number
of entry-level jobs...

51
00:03:15,041 --> 00:03:18,704
over the next four years.

52
00:03:18,745 --> 00:03:23,614
Median income for those jobs
will go down as well.

53
00:03:23,650 --> 00:03:26,778
Obviously, my friends,
it's a competitive world...

54
00:03:26,987 --> 00:03:30,184
and good grades
are your only ticket through.

55
00:03:30,223 --> 00:03:31,713
In fact, by the year 2000...

56
00:03:31,758 --> 00:03:35,091
...chance of contracting HIV
from a non-monogamous life...

57
00:03:35,128 --> 00:03:37,619
will climb to 1 in 150.

58
00:03:37,664 --> 00:03:42,067
The odds of dying in an auto
accident are only 1 in 2500.

59
00:03:42,102 --> 00:03:43,694
Now,
this marks a drastic increase...

60
00:03:43,737 --> 00:03:46,297
...from 14 years ago
when ozone depletion...

61
00:03:46,339 --> 00:03:48,204
of its current level.

62
00:03:48,241 --> 00:03:50,368
By the time
you are 30 years old...

63
00:03:50,410 --> 00:03:53,345
average global temperature
will have risen 2 1/2 degrees...

64
00:03:53,380 --> 00:03:55,541
causing such
catastrophic consequences...

65
00:03:55,582 --> 00:04:00,212
as typhoons, floods,
widespread drought, and famine.

66
00:04:00,253 --> 00:04:04,485
OK, who can tell me
what famine is?

67
00:04:14,200 --> 00:04:16,100
Honey, I'm home.

68
00:04:19,139 --> 00:04:22,370
Hello, darling.
How was your day?

69
00:04:22,409 --> 00:04:24,775
Oh, swell.
You know, Mr. Connell says...

70
00:04:24,811 --> 00:04:27,075
if things keep going
the way they are...

71
00:04:27,147 --> 00:04:29,547
I might be seeing that promotion
sooner than I thought.

72
00:04:29,583 --> 00:04:32,118
Oh, darling, that's wonderful.

73
00:04:32,118 --> 00:04:34,382
I always knew you could do it.

74
00:04:35,622 --> 00:04:39,422
Hey, pumpkin, what's that smell?
ls that your meat loaf?

75
00:04:39,459 --> 00:04:40,790
It might be.

76
00:04:40,827 --> 00:04:42,260
It might be.

77
00:04:42,295 --> 00:04:44,695
Oh, pumpkin,
you sure know the way...

78
00:04:44,731 --> 00:04:47,165
to this man's heart.

79
00:04:47,200 --> 00:04:49,430
No, that was not the deal.

80
00:04:49,469 --> 00:04:52,734
No, you have custody
first weekend of every month.

81
00:04:52,772 --> 00:04:54,239
This is the first weekend.

82
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,765
No. I'm not gonna bail you out.

83
00:04:56,843 --> 00:04:59,573
I'm going out of town
this weekend.

84
00:04:59,613 --> 00:05:00,875
La Costa.

85
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:04,608
Barry, if I want to have a mud
bath with my new boyfriend...

86
00:05:04,651 --> 00:05:06,414
that's my business, isn't it?

87
00:05:06,453 --> 00:05:08,683
Hey, where are those kids?

88
00:05:08,722 --> 00:05:10,587
Right behind you, Father.

89
00:05:10,624 --> 00:05:13,159
Right behind you, Father.

90
00:05:13,159 --> 00:05:17,596
Mother, Father, Bud has
a little surprise for you.

91
00:05:17,631 --> 00:05:18,859
What's that, Bud?

92
00:05:18,898 --> 00:05:20,593
First place in the science fair.

93
00:05:21,768 --> 00:05:23,827
There were
lots of swell projects.

94
00:05:23,870 --> 00:05:25,838
I guess
mine was just the swellest.

95
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:27,430
Darling, that's wonderful...

96
00:05:27,474 --> 00:05:29,635
except there's
no such word as "swellest."

97
00:05:29,676 --> 00:05:32,645
Well, gee whiz, Mom,
it wasn't the English fair.

98
00:05:32,679 --> 00:05:35,204
[Laughter]

99
00:05:35,248 --> 00:05:36,806
No, that's not the point.

100
00:05:36,850 --> 00:05:40,547
The point is,
you're supposed to see them.

101
00:05:40,587 --> 00:05:43,147
Fine. See them another time.

102
00:05:44,424 --> 00:05:45,789
What's a mother to do?

103
00:05:45,825 --> 00:05:48,191
What's a mother to do?

104
00:05:59,339 --> 00:06:02,433
OK, in the very first
Pleasantville episode...

105
00:06:02,475 --> 00:06:04,204
whose window did Bud break...

106
00:06:04,244 --> 00:06:06,212
when he was playing
with his father's golf clubs?

107
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:07,645
Easy. Mr. Jenkins.

108
00:06:07,681 --> 00:06:10,172
What job did Mr. Jenkins have?

109
00:06:11,418 --> 00:06:13,511
Salesman.

110
00:06:13,553 --> 00:06:18,684
What did they name the cat
they found in the gutter?

111
00:06:18,725 --> 00:06:20,192
Scout?

112
00:06:20,226 --> 00:06:22,524
Marmalade.

113
00:06:22,562 --> 00:06:25,190
All right, all right.

114
00:06:25,231 --> 00:06:27,165
Here's one.

115
00:06:27,200 --> 00:06:29,168
Why did their parents
come home early...

116
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:31,170
from their weekend at the lake?

117
00:06:33,339 --> 00:06:35,742
'Cause Bud didn't
answer the phone...

118
00:06:35,742 --> 00:06:37,573
and they were worried about him.

119
00:06:37,610 --> 00:06:40,909
Man...you're unbelievable.

120
00:06:40,947 --> 00:06:43,916
You'll win this thing for sure.
When is it on?

121
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:48,546
Marathon starts at 6:30,
contest is tomorrow at noon.

122
00:06:48,621 --> 00:06:52,785
Thousand bucks, huh?
And it's on all night?

123
00:06:52,826 --> 00:06:55,192
Of course. That's why
they call it a marathon.

124
00:06:57,664 --> 00:07:00,690
Oh, my God, he is so pathetic.

125
00:07:00,734 --> 00:07:03,726
I can't believe
you're related to him.

126
00:07:03,770 --> 00:07:05,271
Only on my parents' side.

127
00:07:05,271 --> 00:07:07,569
Yeah, but you guys
are twins and stuff.

128
00:07:07,607 --> 00:07:10,735
You must be from
the cool side of the uterus.

129
00:07:10,777 --> 00:07:13,268
Oh, my God, here they come.

130
00:07:14,681 --> 00:07:17,309
Oh, my God,
just don't do anything.

131
00:07:17,350 --> 00:07:18,476
What?

132
00:07:27,727 --> 00:07:29,262
Saw you at the mall yesterday.

133
00:07:29,262 --> 00:07:31,526
Yeah, I saw you, too.

134
00:07:31,564 --> 00:07:34,590
So, you gonna watch
the concert on MTV tonight?

135
00:07:34,634 --> 00:07:36,727
Yeah. You?

136
00:07:41,241 --> 00:07:43,766
My mom's gonna be out of town.

137
00:07:45,979 --> 00:07:48,743
-Cool.
-Cool.

138
00:07:48,815 --> 00:07:50,646
It was so amazing, Daph.

139
00:07:50,683 --> 00:07:53,345
I was, like,
"My mom's gonna go out of town."

140
00:07:53,386 --> 00:07:55,786
And he was like,
"Well, maybe we could..."

141
00:07:55,822 --> 00:07:58,791
And I was, "Yeah, sure."
And he was, "Cool."

142
00:07:58,858 --> 00:08:01,554
I know. He's so smart.

143
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,655
I'm thinking about that
red thing I got at the mall.

144
00:08:05,698 --> 00:08:06,995
It's not slutty.

145
00:08:08,601 --> 00:08:11,263
It's fun.

146
00:08:11,304 --> 00:08:13,738
Well, hello,
he's not coming over to study.

147
00:08:13,773 --> 00:08:15,341
Yeah, I know.

148
00:08:15,341 --> 00:08:19,300
Well, sometimes
I'm jealous of you, too.

149
00:08:19,345 --> 00:08:22,678
He's not homeless, Howard.
They don't say where he lives.

150
00:08:24,651 --> 00:08:26,516
Well, it's a silly question.

151
00:08:27,854 --> 00:08:30,550
Because nobody's homeless
in Pleasantville.

152
00:08:32,725 --> 00:08:34,590
'Cause that's
just not what it's like.

153
00:08:38,565 --> 00:08:40,533
Look, Howard, it's almost 6:30.

154
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:42,501
I gotta go.

155
00:09:10,363 --> 00:09:11,887
-What are you doing?
-What are you doing?

156
00:09:11,931 --> 00:09:15,662
Cut it out, David. Mark Davis
is gonna be here in minutes.

157
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,671
Great. The Pleasantville
marathon starts at 6:30.

158
00:09:18,705 --> 00:09:21,640
I don't believe this!
He's gonna be here!

159
00:09:21,674 --> 00:09:23,539
You can watch it upstairs.

160
00:09:23,576 --> 00:09:25,771
Upstairs?!

161
00:09:25,812 --> 00:09:27,871
It doesn't have any stereo!

162
00:09:32,018 --> 00:09:34,384
Oh, my God.

163
00:09:34,420 --> 00:09:35,944
Oh, my God!

164
00:09:35,989 --> 00:09:39,117
David, stop stressing.
You can turn it on normally.

165
00:09:39,158 --> 00:09:42,389
No, I can't. It's a new TV, Jen.

166
00:09:42,428 --> 00:09:44,919
It doesn't work
without a remote.

167
00:09:44,964 --> 00:09:46,591
Oh, my God, he's here!

168
00:09:54,641 --> 00:09:56,700
TV repair.

169
00:09:56,743 --> 00:09:58,005
TV repair?

170
00:09:58,044 --> 00:09:59,568
Yeah. TV busted?

171
00:10:00,980 --> 00:10:03,380
Well, here I am.

172
00:10:08,988 --> 00:10:12,719
Holy cow, look at that.

173
00:10:12,759 --> 00:10:14,727
Had a little disaster,
didn't you, fella?

174
00:10:14,761 --> 00:10:16,023
Well, yeah, sort of.

175
00:10:16,062 --> 00:10:18,462
Well, we'll get you fixed up
in no time.

176
00:10:20,800 --> 00:10:22,597
I know how
I'd feel if mine went out.

177
00:10:22,635 --> 00:10:26,196
Almost like losing a friend.

178
00:10:26,406 --> 00:10:29,864
You know,
we didn't call any TV repair.

179
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,969
That makes it a lucky day
for both of us, doesn't it?

180
00:10:33,012 --> 00:10:34,980
Do you think
you could do this soon?

181
00:10:35,014 --> 00:10:37,448
-It's almost 6:30.
-What's the hurry?

182
00:10:37,483 --> 00:10:39,917
Pleasantville marathon
starts at 6:30.

183
00:10:42,655 --> 00:10:45,624
Pleasantville?
Gosh, I love that show.

184
00:10:45,658 --> 00:10:47,023
Watched it for years.

185
00:10:47,060 --> 00:10:49,927
That's not the reason.
I've got a date at 6:30.

186
00:10:49,963 --> 00:10:52,488
Who did Muffin take
to the masquerade ball...

187
00:10:52,532 --> 00:10:54,500
when her date came down
with the measles?

188
00:10:54,500 --> 00:10:57,663
-Her father.
-That's right.

189
00:10:57,704 --> 00:11:00,673
-And how'd she dress him?
-As Prince Charming.

190
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:04,074
Nice. Remember the one
where Bud lost his cousin...

191
00:11:04,110 --> 00:11:07,511
when he was supposed
to be watching him?

192
00:11:07,547 --> 00:11:09,139
What department store
did they go to?

193
00:11:09,182 --> 00:11:11,742
-Mclntyre's.
-McGinty's.

194
00:11:11,784 --> 00:11:14,617
No. Mclntyre's. Remember?

195
00:11:14,654 --> 00:11:17,214
For the very best
in men's attire

196
00:11:17,256 --> 00:11:20,453
Head right down to Mclntyre's

197
00:11:23,529 --> 00:11:24,996
That's right.

198
00:11:27,900 --> 00:11:29,162
Listen...

199
00:11:31,804 --> 00:11:35,069
Why don't you take
this remote instead?

200
00:11:35,108 --> 00:11:36,871
It's got a little more
oomph in it.

201
00:11:36,909 --> 00:11:38,240
Oomph?

202
00:11:38,277 --> 00:11:41,508
Sure.
Big beautiful set like that?

203
00:11:41,547 --> 00:11:44,539
You want something that'll
put you right in the show.

204
00:11:49,789 --> 00:11:51,814
It's great. We'll take it.

205
00:11:54,227 --> 00:11:56,127
Thank you.

206
00:11:56,162 --> 00:11:59,063
Well, I better get going.

207
00:11:59,098 --> 00:12:00,588
Your show's almost on...

208
00:12:00,633 --> 00:12:03,193
and it's almost time
for your date.

209
00:12:08,541 --> 00:12:10,702
Take care now.

210
00:12:35,201 --> 00:12:37,601
Whether it's on the track
at lndy...

211
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:40,730
or driving around the block,
only new Pennzoil...

212
00:12:40,773 --> 00:12:42,297
For program information...

213
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,036
Honey, I'm home.

214
00:12:48,081 --> 00:12:49,173
Great.

215
00:12:49,215 --> 00:12:50,204
Let me see that.

216
00:12:50,249 --> 00:12:51,739
No way.

217
00:13:03,062 --> 00:13:06,759
Gee whiz, Mary Sue,
why can't I borrow your radio?

218
00:13:06,833 --> 00:13:08,767
I promised Betty Jean
she could use it.

219
00:13:08,801 --> 00:13:09,893
Do you mind?

220
00:13:09,936 --> 00:13:12,097
This is only the most important
moment of my life!

221
00:13:12,138 --> 00:13:14,106
Forget it, Jen!
I've waited a year for this!

222
00:13:14,140 --> 00:13:16,938
Come on, David,
just give it to me!

223
00:13:16,976 --> 00:13:19,274
-Forget it!
-No way, Bud!

224
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:22,142
Forget it, Mary Sue!

225
00:13:22,181 --> 00:13:25,378
Come on, Bud!
It's mine! Give it back!

226
00:13:35,294 --> 00:13:36,727
Oh, my God.

227
00:13:36,762 --> 00:13:39,253
-What happened?
-I'm not sure.

228
00:13:42,168 --> 00:13:43,795
Hi, Sport. Hi, Muffin.

229
00:13:43,836 --> 00:13:46,304
Better get a move on.
You'll be late for school.

230
00:13:47,406 --> 00:13:50,239
-What did you do?
-I don't know.

231
00:13:52,178 --> 00:13:54,840
Look at me! I'm pasty!

232
00:13:54,881 --> 00:13:56,678
Over here!

233
00:13:57,750 --> 00:13:59,911
Told you it was your lucky day.

234
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,182
I bet you thought
I was just a fan or something.

235
00:14:02,221 --> 00:14:03,779
What happened?

236
00:14:03,823 --> 00:14:06,383
A miracle. Every time
I thought I'd found someone...

237
00:14:06,425 --> 00:14:08,394
they'd turn out
to disappoint me.

238
00:14:08,394 --> 00:14:11,693
They'd know the early episodes,
but not the later ones.

239
00:14:11,731 --> 00:14:15,132
They'd know all about Muffin,
but not about Bud.

240
00:14:15,168 --> 00:14:16,658
What the hell is going on?

241
00:14:16,702 --> 00:14:19,000
Can't talk like that here.

242
00:14:19,038 --> 00:14:22,166
You're in...Well, you know.

243
00:14:22,208 --> 00:14:25,268
Bud, Mary Sue,
breakfast is on the table.

244
00:14:25,311 --> 00:14:27,404
We're in Pleasantville?

245
00:14:27,446 --> 00:14:29,676
A dream come true, huh?

246
00:14:29,715 --> 00:14:31,307
Listen, this really isn't funny.

247
00:14:31,350 --> 00:14:33,944
I have a very important date
in five minutes!

248
00:14:33,986 --> 00:14:36,079
You don't have to worry
about that anymore.

249
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:41,319
Bitch.

250
00:14:42,328 --> 00:14:44,228
You have got to get us
out of here!

251
00:14:44,263 --> 00:14:46,458
-Why would I do that?
-Because we don't belong!

252
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:50,158
Sure you do.
Mclntyre's department store...

253
00:14:50,236 --> 00:14:52,204
their father dressed
as Prince Charming.

254
00:14:52,238 --> 00:14:54,035
That was gorgeous, Bud.

255
00:14:54,073 --> 00:14:56,974
-My name is David!
-Oh, God!

256
00:14:57,009 --> 00:14:59,842
This is a strange way of
showing your appreciation.

257
00:14:59,879 --> 00:15:01,847
Hey, we appreciate it.
We really do.

258
00:15:01,881 --> 00:15:03,781
We just want to go home now.

259
00:15:03,816 --> 00:15:07,149
But you don't know how long I've
looked for someone like you.

260
00:15:07,186 --> 00:15:10,451
I'm very disappointed.

261
00:15:10,489 --> 00:15:12,980
In fact, I'm starting
to get a little upset.

262
00:15:13,025 --> 00:15:14,720
No, don't get upset.

263
00:15:14,760 --> 00:15:17,695
Well, wouldn't you?
You look for someone for years.

264
00:15:17,730 --> 00:15:20,028
You pour your heart into it--

265
00:15:20,066 --> 00:15:22,500
This is a privilege, you know!

266
00:15:22,702 --> 00:15:25,136
I don't think I'd better
talk about this now.

267
00:15:25,171 --> 00:15:26,729
Where are you going?

268
00:15:26,772 --> 00:15:30,071
I don't think we should discuss
this until I'm composed.

269
00:15:30,109 --> 00:15:31,508
Wait a minute!

270
00:15:31,711 --> 00:15:34,111
Maybe in a while
when I'm not so emotional!

271
00:15:34,146 --> 00:15:37,877
Give you a week or two
to change your attitude!

272
00:15:37,917 --> 00:15:39,942
Come back!

273
00:15:39,986 --> 00:15:41,248
Come back!

274
00:15:46,292 --> 00:15:48,226
A week or two?

275
00:15:53,299 --> 00:15:55,927
Oh, God.

276
00:15:55,968 --> 00:15:58,129
What's gonna happen?

277
00:15:58,170 --> 00:16:00,968
I don't know. It's not possible.
Is it possible?

278
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:04,306
Bud, Mary Sue,
your breakfast is getting cold.

279
00:16:04,343 --> 00:16:07,141
It can't be possible.

280
00:16:18,190 --> 00:16:19,959
Well, come on, kids.

281
00:16:19,959 --> 00:16:23,292
You're not going to school
without breakfast inside you.

282
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:27,158
Forward march.

283
00:16:47,286 --> 00:16:49,811
I just love you in that sweater,
Mary Sue.

284
00:16:49,855 --> 00:16:52,119
It's so flattering.

285
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:53,819
Thanks.

286
00:16:56,796 --> 00:16:57,854
Morning, kids.

287
00:16:57,897 --> 00:17:01,333
Better get a move on,
or you'll be late for school.

288
00:17:01,367 --> 00:17:03,164
I don't believe this.

289
00:17:03,202 --> 00:17:04,537
Neither do l.

290
00:17:04,537 --> 00:17:06,903
Well, come on, dig in.

291
00:17:06,939 --> 00:17:09,464
I put blueberries in them
just the way you like.

292
00:17:12,044 --> 00:17:14,308
Well, come on, sweetie,
it's getting late.

293
00:17:15,548 --> 00:17:19,143
Actually, I'm not hungry.

294
00:17:21,087 --> 00:17:22,611
Nonsense, young lady.

295
00:17:22,822 --> 00:17:25,484
You're gonna start your day off
with a nice, big breakfast.

296
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:27,583
Here we go. Sit down.

297
00:17:29,362 --> 00:17:32,422
Here's some pancakes and eggs.

298
00:17:34,467 --> 00:17:38,961
Sausage and
some good crisp bacon.

299
00:17:41,207 --> 00:17:43,300
And, of course, a ham steak.

300
00:17:47,279 --> 00:17:50,510
You eat on up,
then it's off to school.

301
00:17:58,557 --> 00:18:00,081
Hurry, hurry.

302
00:18:09,068 --> 00:18:12,094
I'm gonna hurl, David,
I swear to God.

303
00:18:12,138 --> 00:18:13,901
Just take deep breaths.

304
00:18:13,939 --> 00:18:17,568
It's all that animal fat.
I can feel it in my pores.

305
00:18:17,610 --> 00:18:19,601
I still don't see why
we're doing this.

306
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:21,340
Because we're supposed
to be in school.

307
00:18:21,380 --> 00:18:23,371
We're supposed to be at home.

308
00:18:23,416 --> 00:18:25,350
We're supposed to be in color!

309
00:18:25,384 --> 00:18:26,476
Oh, God!

310
00:18:26,519 --> 00:18:28,248
Hello, Bud.

311
00:18:29,321 --> 00:18:31,255
Hello, Mr. Simpson.

312
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,087
Hear your dad's got a new car.

313
00:18:33,125 --> 00:18:37,528
Oh, yeah. A Buick. It's swell.

314
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:39,588
Great.

315
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,191
Do you know that guy?

316
00:18:43,235 --> 00:18:46,261
Yeah.
He owns the hardware store.

317
00:18:46,305 --> 00:18:48,432
You listen to me
for just a minute!

318
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:51,534
I don't know what you've done,
but you better fix it!

319
00:18:51,577 --> 00:18:54,102
I had a date with Mark Davis,
and I even bought new underwear!

320
00:18:54,146 --> 00:18:57,115
We have to play along
until that guy shows up again.

321
00:18:57,149 --> 00:18:58,548
Play along?

322
00:18:58,584 --> 00:19:01,576
Yes! I am Bud Parker,
and you are Mary Sue.

323
00:19:03,656 --> 00:19:05,487
No. I'm not gonna do it.

324
00:19:05,524 --> 00:19:07,526
If I don't dress like this
for Mom...

325
00:19:07,526 --> 00:19:08,993
I'm sure not gonna
do it for you!

326
00:19:09,028 --> 00:19:10,996
We have no choice, Jen.

327
00:19:10,996 --> 00:19:12,623
We are stuck here
until that guy shows up again.

328
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:14,530
Why can't we just explain it
to somebody?

329
00:19:14,567 --> 00:19:16,296
To who?

330
00:19:28,681 --> 00:19:30,581
Go! Go! Go!

331
00:19:38,324 --> 00:19:40,417
Here, kitty.

332
00:19:46,265 --> 00:19:48,324
Oh, God.

333
00:19:48,400 --> 00:19:49,765
We are.

334
00:19:51,570 --> 00:19:54,505
We're stuck in Nerdville.

335
00:20:00,012 --> 00:20:03,175
I knew you'd pay a price
for this.

336
00:20:03,215 --> 00:20:04,705
I knew you couldn't be
so hopelessly geek-ridden...

337
00:20:04,750 --> 00:20:10,518
for so long without suffering
some really tragic consequences.

338
00:20:10,556 --> 00:20:12,547
But it's just not fair.

339
00:20:12,591 --> 00:20:15,788
I was getting really popular.

340
00:20:15,995 --> 00:20:19,795
Debbie Russell transferred
to another school...

341
00:20:19,999 --> 00:20:22,401
and my skin was really great
since March.

342
00:20:22,401 --> 00:20:24,737
Mark Davis was finally starting
to come around.

343
00:20:24,737 --> 00:20:26,034
Hello, Mary Sue.

344
00:20:31,277 --> 00:20:34,371
What's all the commotion?
Where's the cat?

345
00:20:38,217 --> 00:20:39,275
It's...

346
00:20:46,158 --> 00:20:47,489
Right.

347
00:20:49,161 --> 00:20:52,028
I'll see you at school,
Mary Sue.

348
00:21:01,473 --> 00:21:03,236
Who's that?

349
00:21:03,275 --> 00:21:07,541
Skip Martin,
captain of the basketball team.

350
00:21:07,580 --> 00:21:09,480
Does he like me?

351
00:21:10,816 --> 00:21:13,376
As a matter of fact, he does.

352
00:21:28,434 --> 00:21:30,766
Those are my friends?

353
00:21:30,803 --> 00:21:34,830
Peggy Jane, Lisa Anne,
Betty Jean.

354
00:21:34,873 --> 00:21:37,398
Can we do any better?

355
00:21:37,443 --> 00:21:39,843
I don't think so.

356
00:21:50,255 --> 00:21:54,419
Last week, class, we discussed
the geography of Main Street.

357
00:21:54,460 --> 00:21:58,658
This week we're going to be
talking about Elm Street.

358
00:21:58,697 --> 00:22:01,632
Now, can anyone tell me
the difference...

359
00:22:01,667 --> 00:22:04,500
between Elm Street
and Main Street?

360
00:22:04,536 --> 00:22:05,662
Tommy.

361
00:22:05,704 --> 00:22:07,729
It's not as long?

362
00:22:07,773 --> 00:22:10,298
That's right, Tommy.
It's not as long.

363
00:22:10,342 --> 00:22:13,175
Also, it only has houses...

364
00:22:13,212 --> 00:22:17,410
so the geography of Main Street
is different...

365
00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,849
than the geography
of Elm Street.

366
00:22:22,154 --> 00:22:25,248
Yeah. What's outside
of Pleasantville?

367
00:22:32,531 --> 00:22:34,726
I don't understand.

368
00:22:34,767 --> 00:22:38,430
Outside of Pleasantville.

369
00:22:38,470 --> 00:22:40,131
What's at
the end of Main Street?

370
00:22:41,306 --> 00:22:45,333
Mary Sue, you should know
the answer to that.

371
00:22:45,377 --> 00:22:49,871
The end of Main Street
is just the beginning again.

372
00:23:54,012 --> 00:23:56,344
Come on, men, let's go!

373
00:23:59,852 --> 00:24:02,616
That's it, men, keep it up.
Big game tomorrow.

374
00:24:15,701 --> 00:24:16,759
Hiya, Bud.

375
00:24:16,802 --> 00:24:17,769
Hiya, Skip.

376
00:24:17,803 --> 00:24:19,270
Hiya, Bud.

377
00:24:20,606 --> 00:24:21,573
Hiya, Skip.

378
00:24:21,607 --> 00:24:23,700
Bud, can I ask you a question?

379
00:24:23,742 --> 00:24:25,266
Sure.

380
00:24:25,310 --> 00:24:27,938
Well...

381
00:24:27,980 --> 00:24:30,471
If I was
to go up to your sister...

382
00:24:30,516 --> 00:24:32,507
What I mean is,
if I was to go up to Mary Sue--

383
00:24:32,551 --> 00:24:35,611
Oh, my God.
Are we in that episode?

384
00:24:35,654 --> 00:24:38,316
-What?
-I don't believe this.

385
00:24:38,357 --> 00:24:39,483
What's the matter?

386
00:24:39,525 --> 00:24:43,052
You want to ask her out tonight
and give her your school pin.

387
00:24:43,262 --> 00:24:44,661
Yeah. How'd you know?

388
00:24:46,765 --> 00:24:49,290
Look, Skip, I don't think...

389
00:24:49,334 --> 00:24:51,495
it's a real good time for that
right now.

390
00:24:51,537 --> 00:24:53,732
What do you mean?

391
00:24:53,772 --> 00:24:56,935
Well, what I mean is...

392
00:24:56,975 --> 00:25:00,035
Mary Sue's
a little different lately.

393
00:25:00,078 --> 00:25:02,774
She won't go out with me?

394
00:25:02,815 --> 00:25:04,806
No, hey, I didn't say that.

395
00:25:04,850 --> 00:25:08,445
I don't know what I'd do
if she wouldn't go out with me.

396
00:25:26,705 --> 00:25:29,731
Come here, guys.
Don't touch it. Stay back.

397
00:25:29,775 --> 00:25:32,335
I'm sure
we'll work something out.

398
00:25:32,377 --> 00:25:35,505
-I thought you liked him.
-Yeah, but I don't know.

399
00:25:35,547 --> 00:25:38,710
One date, Jen.
That's all I'm asking.

400
00:25:38,750 --> 00:25:40,615
If you don't go out
with this guy...

401
00:25:40,652 --> 00:25:42,415
we could throw their whole
universe out of whack.

402
00:25:42,454 --> 00:25:44,945
It's too weird, David.
This place gives me the creeps.

403
00:25:44,990 --> 00:25:46,423
Did you know
the books are blank?

404
00:25:46,458 --> 00:25:48,551
-What?
-I went in the library.

405
00:25:48,594 --> 00:25:49,959
They have covers
and nothing inside of them.

406
00:25:49,995 --> 00:25:51,860
What were you
doing in a library?

407
00:25:51,897 --> 00:25:54,866
I got lost.
Oh, wait, look at this.

408
00:25:54,900 --> 00:25:57,425
Know why the firemen
only rescue cats out of trees?

409
00:25:57,469 --> 00:25:59,835
-Nothing burns around here.
-Jen, stop!

410
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:03,603
They don't even need firemen!
I could really use a cigarette!

411
00:26:03,642 --> 00:26:07,078
Jen, listen.
I will get us out of here.

412
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,580
I really will,
but if we don't play along...

413
00:26:09,615 --> 00:26:11,947
we can alter
their whole existence...

414
00:26:11,984 --> 00:26:13,918
and then we may never get home.

415
00:26:13,952 --> 00:26:16,580
You really think
anybody's gonna notice...

416
00:26:16,622 --> 00:26:18,988
if I don't have
a chocolate malt with this guy?

417
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:23,853
You won't believe
what we just heard!

418
00:26:23,896 --> 00:26:27,662
-Skip's gonna ask you out!
-That's not all!

419
00:26:27,699 --> 00:26:30,497
He's gonna give you his pin!

420
00:26:33,138 --> 00:26:36,608
Are you sure
I'm supposed to wear this?

421
00:26:36,608 --> 00:26:39,441
I could kill a guy
with these things.

422
00:26:39,478 --> 00:26:40,877
It's in your closet.

423
00:26:40,946 --> 00:26:42,937
I've worn kinky stuff before--

424
00:26:42,981 --> 00:26:45,951
-He won't notice anyway.
-Why not?

425
00:26:45,951 --> 00:26:49,045
They just don't notice
that kind of thing around here.

426
00:26:49,087 --> 00:26:53,114
-So what's the point?
-Jen, please.

427
00:26:53,158 --> 00:26:55,718
Hello. I've got three pounds
of underwire on here.

428
00:26:55,761 --> 00:26:58,787
Just go with the program.
I'm late for work.

429
00:26:58,830 --> 00:27:00,058
Work?

430
00:27:11,910 --> 00:27:15,676
Yeah, sorry.
I just had to help my folks...

431
00:27:15,714 --> 00:27:18,684
and then I couldn't find my hat.

432
00:27:18,684 --> 00:27:21,175
I didn't know what to do.

433
00:27:21,219 --> 00:27:23,153
What's wrong?

434
00:27:23,188 --> 00:27:26,158
Well, I always
wipe down the counter...

435
00:27:26,158 --> 00:27:28,854
and then you set out
the napkins and glasses...

436
00:27:28,894 --> 00:27:31,658
and then I make
the French fries.

437
00:27:31,697 --> 00:27:35,656
But you didn't come
so I just kept on wiping.

438
00:27:40,572 --> 00:27:42,870
I'm sorry.

439
00:27:48,714 --> 00:27:51,911
You know,
if this ever happens again...

440
00:27:54,853 --> 00:27:56,878
You can make the fries...

441
00:27:56,922 --> 00:27:58,981
even if I haven't put out
the napkins yet.

442
00:28:01,760 --> 00:28:03,489
Thank you.

443
00:28:29,621 --> 00:28:31,680
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

444
00:28:31,723 --> 00:28:33,816
What?

445
00:28:33,859 --> 00:28:36,987
Usually, I put out the burger
and you finish with the lettuce.

446
00:28:37,029 --> 00:28:39,998
OK, listen.
Do you have the lettuce?

447
00:28:41,233 --> 00:28:42,757
Have you cooked the burgers?

448
00:28:44,569 --> 00:28:46,571
Put on the lettuce,
finish the burger...

449
00:28:46,571 --> 00:28:48,630
and pretend it was me doing it
the whole time.

450
00:28:50,275 --> 00:28:51,867
You can do it, really.

451
00:29:09,594 --> 00:29:12,154
I sure am glad you said
you'd come out with me tonight.

452
00:29:12,197 --> 00:29:15,860
Well, gee whiz, Skip.
I sure am glad you asked me.

453
00:29:15,901 --> 00:29:19,598
I don't know if I ever said this
to you before...

454
00:29:19,638 --> 00:29:23,165
but I think you're just
about the keenest girl...

455
00:29:23,208 --> 00:29:24,334
in the whole school.

456
00:29:24,543 --> 00:29:26,943
Really, Skip? The keenest?

457
00:29:26,978 --> 00:29:28,878
Oh, yeah.

458
00:29:30,082 --> 00:29:32,617
What can I get you two?

459
00:29:32,617 --> 00:29:34,744
I don't know, Bud.

460
00:29:34,786 --> 00:29:37,687
I guess I'll have my usual
cheeseburger and a cherry Coke.

461
00:29:37,722 --> 00:29:42,625
I don't know, Bud.
I'll have a salad and an Evian.

462
00:29:44,796 --> 00:29:46,957
Cheeseburger it is.

463
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,056
You see?

464
00:29:50,102 --> 00:29:52,900
The whole time we were in Civics
together...

465
00:29:52,938 --> 00:29:55,600
I really wanted to come over
and sit next to you...

466
00:29:55,640 --> 00:29:58,336
but you were always sat between
Lisa Anne and Peggy Jane.

467
00:29:58,376 --> 00:30:02,836
And you always seemed
so smart and everything.

468
00:30:02,881 --> 00:30:06,009
Like that report you did
on our town hall.

469
00:30:06,051 --> 00:30:09,384
Gosh. I didn't know
what I'd talk to you about.

470
00:30:09,588 --> 00:30:14,116
Yeah. Well, sometimes
talking's overrated.

471
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:15,649
Don't you think?

472
00:30:17,729 --> 00:30:20,061
Oh, right.

473
00:30:21,133 --> 00:30:24,296
So I know I haven't been steady
with anybody or anything...

474
00:30:24,336 --> 00:30:26,827
but I just don't want
to rush it.

475
00:30:26,872 --> 00:30:29,306
There's kids that are even
holding hands already...

476
00:30:29,341 --> 00:30:33,300
but I figure there's plenty
of time for that later on.

477
00:30:35,680 --> 00:30:39,013
Can you excuse me
for just a second?

478
00:30:50,162 --> 00:30:51,993
Oh, God.

479
00:30:53,265 --> 00:30:55,699
Oh, God.

480
00:30:55,734 --> 00:30:58,828
-Did he give it to you?
-I bet he did.

481
00:30:58,904 --> 00:31:00,371
I don't think he knows how.

482
00:31:00,405 --> 00:31:03,374
I bet he's gonna take her
to Lovers Lane.

483
00:31:03,408 --> 00:31:05,171
I bet he is.

484
00:31:05,210 --> 00:31:07,770
I bet
he's even gonna hold her hand.

485
00:31:16,788 --> 00:31:21,020
So, anyhow, I really wanted
to sit next to you in Civics--

486
00:31:21,059 --> 00:31:23,391
-You want to get out of here?
-What?

487
00:31:23,428 --> 00:31:25,259
Do you want to go somewhere?

488
00:31:25,297 --> 00:31:27,765
But where could we go?

489
00:31:27,799 --> 00:31:29,357
Lovers Lane.

490
00:31:31,836 --> 00:31:32,894
Lovers Lane?

491
00:31:32,938 --> 00:31:36,965
Yeah, Lover's Lane.
You up for it?

492
00:31:37,976 --> 00:31:39,443
Come on.

493
00:31:39,477 --> 00:31:41,035
Come on.

494
00:31:48,987 --> 00:31:50,388
Oh, shit.

495
00:31:50,388 --> 00:31:52,356
Jennifer!

496
00:31:52,390 --> 00:31:55,086
Jennifer, stop!

497
00:31:55,126 --> 00:31:56,991
Stop!

498
00:31:57,028 --> 00:31:59,929
You can't do this, Jennifer!
He doesn't exist!

499
00:31:59,965 --> 00:32:03,230
You can't do this to someone
who doesn't exist!

500
00:32:08,506 --> 00:32:11,168
It sure is pretty.

501
00:32:11,209 --> 00:32:15,236
Oh, yeah. Gorgeous.

502
00:32:15,280 --> 00:32:19,011
To be honest, Mary Sue,
I didn't think you'd want...

503
00:32:19,050 --> 00:32:21,712
to come here until we'd been
pinned for a little while.

504
00:32:21,753 --> 00:32:26,417
Oh, Skip, you can pin me
anytime you want to.

505
00:32:29,761 --> 00:32:32,321
Or maybe I should just pin you.

506
00:32:32,364 --> 00:32:35,128
That's silly, Mary Sue.

507
00:32:35,166 --> 00:32:37,100
How could you possibly pin me?

508
00:32:59,958 --> 00:33:01,255
Son, what's wrong?

509
00:33:01,293 --> 00:33:03,454
Have you seen Mary Sue?

510
00:33:03,495 --> 00:33:05,986
No. She's still out with Skip.
Is something the matter?

511
00:33:06,031 --> 00:33:08,898
No.
I was just worried about her.

512
00:33:16,174 --> 00:33:18,870
Bud, your sister's
getting older now.

513
00:33:18,910 --> 00:33:21,435
She'll naturally
be going out with boys.

514
00:33:22,847 --> 00:33:24,542
But she's a fine young woman.

515
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:27,813
She would never do anything
for us to be concerned about.

516
00:33:29,487 --> 00:33:30,852
Honest.

517
00:33:47,305 --> 00:33:50,832
I think I better go home now,
Mary Sue.

518
00:33:50,875 --> 00:33:52,206
Why?

519
00:33:52,243 --> 00:33:56,202
I think I might be ill.

520
00:33:56,247 --> 00:33:58,442
Something's happening to me.

521
00:33:58,483 --> 00:34:01,350
That's supposed to happen.

522
00:34:02,420 --> 00:34:04,445
It is?

523
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:07,014
Yeah. Trust me.

524
00:34:08,827 --> 00:34:11,352
Do you want some more cookies?

525
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:14,490
No, thanks. I'm fine.

526
00:34:16,901 --> 00:34:19,961
How about
some marshmallow rice squares?

527
00:34:20,004 --> 00:34:21,369
Those are swell.

528
00:34:21,406 --> 00:34:23,169
No, I'm fine, thank you.

529
00:34:24,909 --> 00:34:27,309
-Who could that be?
-I've got it.

530
00:34:32,350 --> 00:34:35,513
Hi. You took off so quick
I wasn't sure you were OK.

531
00:34:35,553 --> 00:34:39,182
No, I'm fine.
I just had to get home early.

532
00:34:39,224 --> 00:34:42,557
You know how when we close up...

533
00:34:42,594 --> 00:34:45,324
I close the register,
then you lower the blinds...

534
00:34:45,363 --> 00:34:48,526
and I turn out the lights,
and we both lock the doors?

535
00:34:48,566 --> 00:34:52,434
Well, you weren't around
this time...

536
00:34:52,470 --> 00:34:57,874
so I did the whole thing
by myself.

537
00:34:57,909 --> 00:35:00,002
Wow.

538
00:35:01,012 --> 00:35:05,244
And I didn't even do it
in the same order.

539
00:35:05,283 --> 00:35:09,014
First I lowered the blinds,
then I closed the register.

540
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:14,423
Hello, Betty.

541
00:35:14,459 --> 00:35:16,450
Hello, Bill.

542
00:35:21,900 --> 00:35:24,596
OK, well, that's great.
Thank you for stopping by.

543
00:35:24,636 --> 00:35:26,069
I appreciate it.

544
00:35:30,408 --> 00:35:33,002
I'll see you tomorrow.

545
00:35:34,045 --> 00:35:37,981
Well, gee, thanks, Skip.
I sure had a wonderful time.

546
00:35:40,985 --> 00:35:42,646
Me, too.

547
00:35:42,687 --> 00:35:44,678
Night.

548
00:36:00,972 --> 00:36:02,997
Hello, Mr. Johnson.

549
00:36:03,041 --> 00:36:04,565
Oh, hello, Mary Sue.

550
00:36:06,044 --> 00:36:08,979
-What did you do to him?
-Nothing.

551
00:36:09,013 --> 00:36:12,244
What do you mean, "nothing"?
That's not nothing.

552
00:36:12,283 --> 00:36:15,650
Why don't you relax, Bud?
We had a nice time.

553
00:36:15,687 --> 00:36:18,747
I am really sleepy,
and I have to wake up...

554
00:36:18,957 --> 00:36:21,619
early in the morning
to go to school. Night.

555
00:37:05,069 --> 00:37:08,368
Hi. Looks like it's gonna be
another beautiful sunny day.

556
00:37:08,406 --> 00:37:11,569
High 72, low 72,
not a cloud in the sky.

557
00:37:13,044 --> 00:37:16,480
It's 8:00 in the morning.
Are you watching television?

558
00:37:44,809 --> 00:37:47,278
Oh, no.

559
00:37:47,278 --> 00:37:49,075
Come on, men.
Let's get in positions.

560
00:37:49,113 --> 00:37:52,048
We got a big game next week.
Let's go.

561
00:37:52,083 --> 00:37:53,243
Come on.

562
00:37:59,490 --> 00:38:02,391
Oh, my God.

563
00:38:02,460 --> 00:38:05,759
You can't do this, Jennifer.
I warned you.

564
00:38:05,797 --> 00:38:07,424
So what's the big deal?

565
00:38:07,465 --> 00:38:09,433
OK. They're not good
at basketball anymore.

566
00:38:09,467 --> 00:38:11,697
Oh, my God. What a tragedy.

567
00:38:11,736 --> 00:38:12,828
You don't understand.

568
00:38:12,870 --> 00:38:15,270
You're messing with
their whole goddamn universe.

569
00:38:15,306 --> 00:38:17,274
Maybe it needs
to be messed with, David.

570
00:38:17,308 --> 00:38:18,673
Did that ever occur to you?

571
00:38:18,710 --> 00:38:20,405
Hey, M.S., how you doing?

572
00:38:20,445 --> 00:38:22,140
Cool, P.J., how you doing?

573
00:38:22,180 --> 00:38:25,581
Cool. Cool.

574
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:26,709
Cool.

575
00:38:26,751 --> 00:38:29,413
"Cool"? What are you
doing to these people?

576
00:38:29,454 --> 00:38:32,287
-If I don't, who will?
-But they're happy.

577
00:38:32,323 --> 00:38:35,520
Nobody is happy in a
poodle skirt and a sweater set.

578
00:38:37,195 --> 00:38:39,129
You really like this, don't you?

579
00:38:39,163 --> 00:38:42,826
No, it's not like
you think it's funny or dorky.

580
00:38:42,867 --> 00:38:45,131
You really like it.

581
00:38:45,169 --> 00:38:46,636
No. You have it all wrong.

582
00:38:46,671 --> 00:38:48,298
I am personally mortified
to be your sister.

583
00:38:48,373 --> 00:38:50,307
You have no right
to do this to them.

584
00:38:50,341 --> 00:38:52,172
David, listen to me
for just a minute.

585
00:38:52,210 --> 00:38:55,304
They don't want to be geeks.
They want to be attractive.

586
00:38:55,346 --> 00:38:57,644
They have a lot of potential.
They just don't know any better.

587
00:38:57,682 --> 00:38:59,343
They don't have
that kind of potential.

588
00:38:59,384 --> 00:39:01,648
Oh, yeah? Look at that.

589
00:39:05,223 --> 00:39:07,919
Wow. What happened to your gum?

590
00:39:08,126 --> 00:39:09,218
I gotta go.

591
00:39:09,260 --> 00:39:10,784
I'm gonna meet Skip
at the flagpole.

592
00:39:54,439 --> 00:39:56,964
Well, I don't think
it's anything to worry about.

593
00:39:57,175 --> 00:39:59,541
You cut down on greasy
foods and chocolate.

594
00:39:59,577 --> 00:40:01,636
You know, things like that.

595
00:40:01,679 --> 00:40:04,477
It'll probably just clear up
on its own.

596
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,884
Jesus Christ.

597
00:40:36,814 --> 00:40:39,442
Do you think we could have
two cheeseburgers...

598
00:40:39,484 --> 00:40:41,213
and some cherry Cokes?

599
00:40:43,621 --> 00:40:45,418
I'll be right with you.

600
00:40:45,456 --> 00:40:46,923
Thanks.

601
00:40:53,030 --> 00:40:55,931
Two cheeseburgers,
two cherry Cokes.

602
00:40:59,370 --> 00:41:01,565
There aren't any cheeseburgers.

603
00:41:04,709 --> 00:41:07,371
I thought
we talked about this.

604
00:41:07,411 --> 00:41:08,810
What's the point, Bud?

605
00:41:09,781 --> 00:41:12,909
You make hamburgers.
That is the point.

606
00:41:12,950 --> 00:41:14,884
No. I know I do.

607
00:41:14,919 --> 00:41:18,719
It's always the same, you know?

608
00:41:18,756 --> 00:41:21,486
Grill the bun, flip the meat,
melt the cheese.

609
00:41:21,526 --> 00:41:24,495
It never changes.
It never gets better or worse.

610
00:41:24,495 --> 00:41:26,463
OK, just listen for a second.

611
00:41:26,497 --> 00:41:28,465
The other night when I closed
by myself, that was different.

612
00:41:28,533 --> 00:41:30,558
Forget about that!

613
00:41:33,504 --> 00:41:35,836
I really liked it, though.

614
00:41:37,875 --> 00:41:38,864
Come here.

615
00:41:43,681 --> 00:41:44,909
Look.

616
00:41:44,949 --> 00:41:47,850
You can't always
like what you do.

617
00:41:47,885 --> 00:41:50,979
Sometimes you just gotta do it
because it's your job.

618
00:41:51,022 --> 00:41:54,287
And even if you don't like it,
you just gotta do it anyway.

619
00:41:54,325 --> 00:41:55,519
Why?

620
00:41:55,560 --> 00:41:57,994
So they can have
their hamburgers!

621
00:41:59,430 --> 00:42:00,829
I'm sorry.

622
00:42:00,865 --> 00:42:02,355
You know what I really like?

623
00:42:02,400 --> 00:42:05,494
-What's that?
-Christmas time.

624
00:42:05,536 --> 00:42:08,096
See, every year on December 3...

625
00:42:08,306 --> 00:42:10,934
I get to paint the Christmas
decorations in the window...

626
00:42:10,975 --> 00:42:13,637
and every year I get to paint
a different thing.

627
00:42:13,678 --> 00:42:16,112
Here, I'll show you.

628
00:42:21,886 --> 00:42:23,444
Wow. That's pretty good.

629
00:42:23,487 --> 00:42:25,389
Thanks, but this morning
I was thinking...

630
00:42:25,389 --> 00:42:28,483
and I realized that I look
forward to it all year.

631
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,585
And then I thought,
"Gee, that seems awfully silly.

632
00:42:30,628 --> 00:42:33,722
"It seems like a long time
to wait for just one moment."

633
00:42:33,764 --> 00:42:35,095
Don't you think?

634
00:42:35,132 --> 00:42:38,568
Well, don't you?

635
00:42:38,603 --> 00:42:43,040
I think that you should try not
to think about that anymore.

636
00:42:45,610 --> 00:42:47,635
I'll try that, then.

637
00:42:49,981 --> 00:42:52,916
-Morning, Jim.
-How are you, Bill?

638
00:42:52,950 --> 00:42:55,510
Have they ever lost before?

639
00:42:55,586 --> 00:42:57,747
Basketball?
No, they sure haven't.

640
00:42:57,788 --> 00:43:00,382
It just feels wrong, that's all.

641
00:43:00,424 --> 00:43:02,551
Maybe that's where
they get that saying...

642
00:43:02,593 --> 00:43:04,390
"You can't win 'em all."

643
00:43:04,428 --> 00:43:06,862
That's a good point, Ralph.
They do have that saying.

644
00:43:06,898 --> 00:43:10,527
But they do win 'em all.
They've always won 'em all.

645
00:43:10,568 --> 00:43:14,163
Mr. Mayor, here. Go ahead.

646
00:43:14,372 --> 00:43:18,365
Don't be silly, Roy. I couldn't
possibly take your spot.

647
00:43:20,378 --> 00:43:23,575
What I want to know is,
if they've never lost before...

648
00:43:23,614 --> 00:43:27,451
and they've never tied before,
isn't that winning 'em all?

649
00:43:27,451 --> 00:43:30,614
He's right.
That's what you call it.

650
00:43:30,655 --> 00:43:33,021
Yeah, that's true.

651
00:43:33,057 --> 00:43:35,491
He said it would clear up
on its own...

652
00:43:35,526 --> 00:43:39,462
if she just stayed away
from fried foods and sweets.

653
00:43:39,497 --> 00:43:45,629
Except it's spread
to her lips now, too.

654
00:43:45,670 --> 00:43:47,103
Oh, I don't know.

655
00:43:47,138 --> 00:43:50,471
And you say it was just red?

656
00:43:50,508 --> 00:43:54,410
Well, you know, like real red.

657
00:43:54,445 --> 00:43:56,003
I know what you mean.

658
00:43:56,047 --> 00:43:57,912
That's like this car
that was in front...

659
00:43:57,949 --> 00:43:59,849
of Bill Johnson's soda shop.

660
00:43:59,884 --> 00:44:03,047
I was going by it
and it looked green.

661
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:06,181
Real green.
Have you seen him lately?

662
00:44:06,223 --> 00:44:08,054
I was getting my sewing machine
fixed across the street...

663
00:44:08,092 --> 00:44:12,222
and he was sitting in the window
of his shop just staring.

664
00:44:12,430 --> 00:44:15,729
That is strange.

665
00:44:27,211 --> 00:44:28,838
It's your bid, Betty.

666
00:44:38,622 --> 00:44:41,614
What goes on up at Lovers Lane?

667
00:44:42,893 --> 00:44:44,588
What do you mean?

668
00:44:44,628 --> 00:44:48,223
Well, you hear
these things lately--

669
00:44:48,265 --> 00:44:50,167
kids spending so much time
up there.

670
00:44:50,167 --> 00:44:53,898
Is it holding hands?
That kind of thing?

671
00:44:55,039 --> 00:44:57,132
That and...

672
00:44:58,209 --> 00:44:59,699
What?

673
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:02,940
It doesn't matter.

674
00:45:02,980 --> 00:45:05,676
No. I want to know.

675
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:11,016
Well...sex.

676
00:45:16,160 --> 00:45:17,718
What's sex?

677
00:45:23,901 --> 00:45:25,960
You sure you want to know this?

678
00:45:29,040 --> 00:45:31,770
Well...

679
00:45:31,809 --> 00:45:33,834
You see, Mom...

680
00:45:33,911 --> 00:45:37,176
when two people really love
each other very, very much...

681
00:45:37,214 --> 00:45:39,739
and they want to share that...

682
00:45:47,758 --> 00:45:50,056
Are you OK?

683
00:45:54,065 --> 00:45:56,329
It's just that...

684
00:45:57,701 --> 00:46:02,070
your father would never
do anything like that.

685
00:46:07,578 --> 00:46:11,810
Well, you know, Mom...

686
00:46:11,849 --> 00:46:14,909
there are other ways
to enjoy yourself...

687
00:46:14,952 --> 00:46:17,147
without Dad.

688
00:46:33,037 --> 00:46:35,267
Sweetie, you coming to bed?

689
00:46:36,807 --> 00:46:40,607
Yeah. I'm just going
to take a bath first.

690
00:47:17,014 --> 00:47:19,642
Oh, my goodness.

691
00:48:05,729 --> 00:48:06,787
Oh, shit.

692
00:48:12,836 --> 00:48:14,235
Oh, God.

693
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:22,311
Fire!

694
00:48:43,234 --> 00:48:44,997
Cat?

695
00:48:55,946 --> 00:48:57,880
OK, right here.

696
00:48:57,915 --> 00:49:00,145
All right, stop.

697
00:49:00,184 --> 00:49:01,708
Stop!

698
00:49:06,090 --> 00:49:07,751
Where is it?

699
00:49:07,791 --> 00:49:08,917
Whoa!

700
00:49:17,468 --> 00:49:20,062
Here, grab the nozzle.

701
00:49:20,104 --> 00:49:23,096
-But where's the cat?
-Just hold on tight.

702
00:49:23,140 --> 00:49:25,335
Whoa!

703
00:49:25,376 --> 00:49:28,402
So that's what these things do.

704
00:49:31,849 --> 00:49:35,376
In honor and in recognition
of your heroism...

705
00:49:35,419 --> 00:49:39,788
and with great appreciation from
the citizens of Pleasantville...

706
00:49:39,823 --> 00:49:43,190
I am pleased to present you with
this special commendation...

707
00:49:43,227 --> 00:49:45,457
from the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

708
00:50:09,586 --> 00:50:13,113
-That sure was swell.
-Thank you, Margaret.

709
00:50:13,157 --> 00:50:16,593
I baked you
some of my oatmeal cookies.

710
00:50:16,794 --> 00:50:20,355
Oh, no.
You baked those for Whitey.

711
00:50:20,397 --> 00:50:22,831
No. I baked them for you.

712
00:50:24,101 --> 00:50:25,432
No. You baked them for Whitey.

713
00:50:25,469 --> 00:50:28,063
-I baked them for you.
-No--

714
00:50:28,105 --> 00:50:31,074
No. I baked them for you.

715
00:50:34,111 --> 00:50:35,408
Thank you.

716
00:50:36,413 --> 00:50:37,846
Sure.

717
00:51:16,920 --> 00:51:18,387
What's going on?

718
00:51:18,422 --> 00:51:22,153
I'm not sure.
They want to ask you a question.

719
00:51:22,192 --> 00:51:24,251
I didn't really know
how to handle it.

720
00:51:32,536 --> 00:51:33,662
How you doing?

721
00:51:39,977 --> 00:51:42,673
You wanted to ask me something?

722
00:51:46,583 --> 00:51:49,051
How'd you know about the fire?

723
00:51:49,086 --> 00:51:50,053
What?

724
00:51:53,657 --> 00:51:56,057
How'd you know
how to put it out?

725
00:51:58,962 --> 00:52:04,093
Well, where I used to live,
that's just what firemen did.

726
00:52:06,537 --> 00:52:08,630
And where's that?

727
00:52:14,711 --> 00:52:17,578
Outside of Pleasantville.

728
00:52:24,321 --> 00:52:26,551
What's outside of Pleasantville?

729
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:30,253
It doesn't matter.
It's not important.

730
00:52:30,294 --> 00:52:32,626
What's outside of Pleasantville?

731
00:52:54,318 --> 00:52:56,684
There are some places...

732
00:52:56,720 --> 00:53:00,713
that the road doesn't go
in a circle.

733
00:53:00,757 --> 00:53:03,692
There are some places
where the road keeps going.

734
00:53:03,727 --> 00:53:05,194
Keeps going?

735
00:53:07,998 --> 00:53:09,329
Keeps going?

736
00:53:09,366 --> 00:53:12,961
Yeah, it just keeps going.

737
00:53:13,036 --> 00:53:16,403
It all keeps going.
Roads and rivers.

738
00:53:16,440 --> 00:53:18,340
Like the mighty Mississippi?

739
00:53:18,375 --> 00:53:19,501
What?

740
00:53:26,416 --> 00:53:29,078
I thought the books were blank.

741
00:53:29,119 --> 00:53:30,518
They were.

742
00:53:32,122 --> 00:53:34,352
This was not my fault.

743
00:53:34,391 --> 00:53:35,756
When they asked me
what it was about...

744
00:53:35,792 --> 00:53:38,727
I didn't remember because
I read it back in tenth grade.

745
00:53:38,762 --> 00:53:40,354
When I told them
what I did remember...

746
00:53:40,397 --> 00:53:42,262
that's when the pages filled in.

747
00:53:42,299 --> 00:53:44,494
The pages filled in?

748
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:47,527
But only up until the part
with the raft...

749
00:53:47,571 --> 00:53:49,368
'cause that's as far as I read.

750
00:53:51,174 --> 00:53:53,506
Do you know how it ends?

751
00:53:53,544 --> 00:53:56,274
-Yeah, I do.
-So how does it end?

752
00:54:03,420 --> 00:54:06,583
Well, OK.

753
00:54:06,623 --> 00:54:08,591
Let's see,
they were running away--

754
00:54:08,625 --> 00:54:10,422
Huck and the slave.

755
00:54:10,460 --> 00:54:13,224
They were going up the river,
trying to get free.

756
00:54:13,263 --> 00:54:16,391
And, in trying to get free...

757
00:54:16,433 --> 00:54:20,164
they see that
they're sort of free already.

758
00:54:25,642 --> 00:54:26,836
Oh, my God.

759
00:54:32,816 --> 00:54:34,579
What about this one?

760
00:54:37,254 --> 00:54:38,846
Oh, yeah. This is great.

761
00:54:39,056 --> 00:54:43,083
This kid Holden Caulfield.
He's a really lonely kid.

762
00:54:43,126 --> 00:54:45,424
He gets kicked out
of boarding school.

763
00:55:05,115 --> 00:55:07,515
Look at 'em.

764
00:55:07,551 --> 00:55:09,519
It's spreadin'
all over the place.

765
00:55:09,553 --> 00:55:10,850
Look at her books.

766
00:55:11,888 --> 00:55:13,617
Look at her sweater.

767
00:55:14,791 --> 00:55:18,192
Going up to that lake
all the time is one thing...

768
00:55:18,228 --> 00:55:20,196
but now they're going
to a library?

769
00:55:20,230 --> 00:55:22,630
What's next?

770
00:55:24,835 --> 00:55:26,302
You're right.

771
00:55:26,336 --> 00:55:29,396
Somebody ought
to do something about that.

772
00:55:35,412 --> 00:55:37,346
Soon.

773
00:55:43,520 --> 00:55:45,511
You're probably wondering...

774
00:55:45,555 --> 00:55:48,525
why I asked to stop by
and see you today.

775
00:55:48,525 --> 00:55:51,495
I'm sure you've noticed
the same things we all have.

776
00:55:51,495 --> 00:55:55,397
Certain changes in the town.

777
00:55:55,432 --> 00:55:58,799
You know what I mean by changes?

778
00:56:00,203 --> 00:56:01,431
Changes.

779
00:56:01,471 --> 00:56:03,405
Changes.

780
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:07,240
And I'm not just talking
about big stuff like the fire.

781
00:56:07,277 --> 00:56:09,802
It's the little things.
Did you hear about Bill Miller?

782
00:56:09,846 --> 00:56:11,313
No. What?

783
00:56:11,348 --> 00:56:13,578
Wife wants him
to get one of those new beds.

784
00:56:13,617 --> 00:56:16,484
One of those big beds?

785
00:56:16,520 --> 00:56:20,513
Oh, my gosh. What's he gonna do?

786
00:56:20,557 --> 00:56:22,616
I don't know. It's everywhere.

787
00:56:22,659 --> 00:56:25,228
Bill Anderson's boy
just quit his job at the market.

788
00:56:25,228 --> 00:56:26,525
Quit?

789
00:56:26,563 --> 00:56:28,899
Just took his apron off right in
the middle of an order...

790
00:56:28,899 --> 00:56:30,924
said,
"I don't feel like it anymore."

791
00:56:30,967 --> 00:56:32,958
Groceries all over the counter.

792
00:56:33,170 --> 00:56:35,536
Took 'em three hours
just to sort it out.

793
00:56:37,741 --> 00:56:41,541
Everybody
really likes you, George.

794
00:56:41,578 --> 00:56:44,206
-Well...
-No, they do.

795
00:56:44,247 --> 00:56:47,182
Not just 'cause you're a good
bowler. People respect you.

796
00:56:47,217 --> 00:56:49,208
Well, thank you.

797
00:56:49,252 --> 00:56:51,888
It's important for them to see
someone they respect...

798
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:53,856
stand up for what's right.

799
00:56:53,890 --> 00:56:56,654
If you love a place,
you can't just sit back...

800
00:56:56,693 --> 00:56:59,890
and watch this kind of thing
happen, can you?

801
00:56:59,930 --> 00:57:01,898
No, of course not.

802
00:57:01,932 --> 00:57:04,924
That is why I want you
to be a member...

803
00:57:04,968 --> 00:57:07,300
of the Pleasantville
Chamber of Commerce.

804
00:57:09,473 --> 00:57:11,839
Oh, my gosh.

805
00:57:13,243 --> 00:57:14,904
I hardly know what to say.

806
00:57:16,780 --> 00:57:18,680
It's just like yours.

807
00:57:18,715 --> 00:57:21,741
It is exactly like mine, George.

808
00:57:25,021 --> 00:57:26,750
You can start by saying yes.

809
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:31,593
And by getting me one of
those swell pineapple kabobs.

810
00:57:31,628 --> 00:57:33,493
Well, sure. You bet!

811
00:57:33,530 --> 00:57:35,225
Betty, Bob wants to try...

812
00:57:35,265 --> 00:57:37,256
some of your great
hors d'oeuvres.

813
00:57:49,946 --> 00:57:51,641
I'll get her.

814
00:58:00,023 --> 00:58:01,388
Are you OK?

815
00:58:13,603 --> 00:58:15,036
You all right?

816
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:21,606
What am I going to do?

817
00:58:23,580 --> 00:58:27,676
I can't go out there this way.

818
00:58:27,717 --> 00:58:30,550
How can I go out there this way?

819
00:58:34,024 --> 00:58:36,720
Look at me.

820
00:58:36,760 --> 00:58:40,355
It's OK. It's all right.

821
00:58:45,302 --> 00:58:47,293
Have you got any makeup?

822
00:58:51,508 --> 00:58:54,500
In my handbag.

823
00:58:58,748 --> 00:59:00,909
Honey, where are you?

824
00:59:02,786 --> 00:59:04,048
Here. Give me your cheek.

825
00:59:08,558 --> 00:59:11,322
Here. Give me the other. There.

826
00:59:12,963 --> 00:59:16,990
That's good.
Now lift your chin up.

827
00:59:17,033 --> 00:59:18,796
-Is it working?
-Yes.

828
00:59:20,403 --> 00:59:22,428
Here, look at me.

829
00:59:43,894 --> 00:59:46,055
What?

830
00:59:46,096 --> 00:59:48,826
Does it look OK?

831
00:59:48,865 --> 00:59:50,696
Yeah. It looks just like it did.

832
00:59:53,803 --> 00:59:56,795
And they won't be able to tell?

833
00:59:56,840 --> 00:59:59,536
No, they won't be able to tell.

834
00:59:59,576 --> 01:00:03,034
Betty, are you in there?

835
01:00:03,079 --> 01:00:04,444
Boy...

836
01:00:20,530 --> 01:00:21,929
Coming, sweetie.

837
01:00:35,712 --> 01:00:37,907
Aren't you a little bit early?

838
01:00:37,948 --> 01:00:41,440
I brought you something
from the library.

839
01:00:42,819 --> 01:00:43,945
It's an art book.

840
01:00:45,822 --> 01:00:48,154
Oh, my gosh, Bud.

841
01:00:49,426 --> 01:00:52,122
Since you liked to paint,
it might help to...

842
01:01:06,876 --> 01:01:10,073
Gee whiz.

843
01:01:15,852 --> 01:01:18,980
Who is...Titian?

844
01:01:19,022 --> 01:01:20,853
I'm not sure.

845
01:02:18,281 --> 01:02:20,146
It's beautiful, Bud.

846
01:02:26,956 --> 01:02:28,253
What's wrong?

847
01:02:29,726 --> 01:02:31,921
No, it's just...

848
01:02:31,961 --> 01:02:34,225
I'll never be able to do that.

849
01:02:34,264 --> 01:02:36,994
Well, you just started.
I mean, you can't do it now.

850
01:02:37,033 --> 01:02:38,967
That's not it.

851
01:02:39,002 --> 01:02:42,938
Just where am I gonna see
colors like that?

852
01:02:44,774 --> 01:02:48,111
Must be awful lucky
to see colors like that.

853
01:02:48,111 --> 01:02:51,911
I'll bet they don't know
how lucky they are.

854
01:02:59,789 --> 01:03:03,088
-How you doing?
-Swell.

855
01:03:03,126 --> 01:03:07,790
Look, you probably don't think
I should be asking you this.

856
01:03:11,768 --> 01:03:14,066
Will you go out with me tonight?

857
01:03:20,944 --> 01:03:23,708
Hey, Mr. Simpson,
your lawn looks great.

858
01:03:40,797 --> 01:03:42,788
Well, come here, young fella.

859
01:03:45,168 --> 01:03:47,136
You know, I've been thinking.

860
01:03:47,170 --> 01:03:49,001
I might have been
a little hasty the other day...

861
01:03:49,038 --> 01:03:51,199
when you asked to come home.

862
01:03:51,241 --> 01:03:55,177
It just took me
by such surprise, you know?

863
01:03:55,211 --> 01:03:58,669
So even though
I can't make any promises...

864
01:03:58,715 --> 01:04:01,047
I figured
if you asked me real nice...

865
01:04:01,084 --> 01:04:04,076
I might just be willing
to talk about it again.

866
01:04:04,120 --> 01:04:07,647
-I can't.
-What?

867
01:04:07,690 --> 01:04:08,850
Talk about it right now.

868
01:04:08,892 --> 01:04:12,123
I'll be honest with you, Bud.
I'm getting concerned...

869
01:04:12,162 --> 01:04:15,097
about what I'm seeing
on some of these reruns.

870
01:04:15,131 --> 01:04:16,621
Reruns?

871
01:04:16,666 --> 01:04:20,397
Like when Margaret Henderson
makes her cookies for Whitey.

872
01:04:20,436 --> 01:04:22,927
Those are not your cookies, Bud.

873
01:04:22,972 --> 01:04:25,167
I know they're not my cookies--

874
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:28,644
Those are Whitey's cookies, Bud.
They belong to him.

875
01:04:28,678 --> 01:04:31,347
Then he eats them and asks her
to go to Lovers Lane--

876
01:04:31,347 --> 01:04:33,338
I would love to talk about
all this right now...

877
01:04:33,383 --> 01:04:36,750
but I am really in a hurry.
I can't hear you!

878
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:38,845
It's really cruddy reception!
We'll talk later!

879
01:04:51,968 --> 01:04:53,196
What's wrong?

880
01:04:54,837 --> 01:04:57,032
Listen...

881
01:04:57,073 --> 01:04:59,132
You're reading.

882
01:04:59,175 --> 01:05:02,008
I can't believe you started
such a dorky fad.

883
01:05:02,045 --> 01:05:03,706
It's D.H...

884
01:05:04,847 --> 01:05:05,939
Lawrence.

885
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:07,711
You ever heard of him?

886
01:05:08,818 --> 01:05:12,481
Yeah, I read a couple of pages.
Seemed kind of sexy.

887
01:05:12,689 --> 01:05:14,452
It is.

888
01:05:14,490 --> 01:05:17,948
Can I ask you a question?

889
01:05:17,994 --> 01:05:19,052
Sure.

890
01:05:23,266 --> 01:05:26,326
How come
I'm still in black and white?

891
01:05:26,369 --> 01:05:27,461
What?

892
01:05:27,503 --> 01:05:29,471
I've had
10 times as much sex...

893
01:05:29,505 --> 01:05:33,874
as the rest of these girls,
and I still look like this.

894
01:05:33,910 --> 01:05:36,071
I mean, they spend like an hour
in the back seat of some car...

895
01:05:36,112 --> 01:05:37,841
and all of a sudden,
they're in Technicolor?

896
01:05:39,415 --> 01:05:43,317
I don't know.
Maybe it's not just the sex.

897
01:05:53,363 --> 01:05:54,796
Where is it?

898
01:05:54,831 --> 01:05:57,197
A little bit farther, I think.

899
01:05:58,234 --> 01:06:01,260
WKPV,
the sounds of Pleasantville.

900
01:06:01,304 --> 01:06:04,831
Here's a new one for
all you kids out at Lovers Lane.

901
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:26,257
Wow.

902
01:07:08,871 --> 01:07:10,361
It's amazing, huh?

903
01:07:50,346 --> 01:07:52,280
We're closed right now.

904
01:07:52,315 --> 01:07:55,580
Oh, I'm sorry. I...

905
01:07:56,586 --> 01:07:59,180
Hi. I just thought that--

906
01:07:59,222 --> 01:08:02,123
No. Come on in.

907
01:08:06,329 --> 01:08:08,422
It's beautiful.

908
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,090
Thanks.

909
01:08:12,135 --> 01:08:15,298
I was just trying to do
one of these still lifes.

910
01:08:15,338 --> 01:08:17,272
Kind of having a tough time.

911
01:08:17,306 --> 01:08:19,297
I think it looks nice.

912
01:08:20,610 --> 01:08:23,340
Well, here's what
it's supposed to look like.

913
01:08:26,916 --> 01:08:28,611
Oh, my.

914
01:08:28,651 --> 01:08:31,017
Here. Look at this.

915
01:08:32,955 --> 01:08:35,219
-Where did you get this?
-Bud brought it to me.

916
01:08:35,258 --> 01:08:38,421
-My Bud?
-Yeah. Here's my favorite.

917
01:08:42,432 --> 01:08:44,559
What do you think?

918
01:08:44,600 --> 01:08:47,569
Isn't it great
how she's resting like that?

919
01:08:49,405 --> 01:08:51,396
She's crying.

920
01:08:51,441 --> 01:08:53,170
No, she's not.

921
01:08:53,209 --> 01:08:55,973
Yes, she is.

922
01:09:10,560 --> 01:09:13,461
-Wait.
-No. I've got to go.

923
01:09:13,496 --> 01:09:15,293
It's all right. Let me see.

924
01:09:32,482 --> 01:09:34,541
It's beautiful.

925
01:09:34,584 --> 01:09:37,519
It's beautiful.

926
01:09:39,422 --> 01:09:41,481
You shouldn't cover that up.

927
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,968
Here. Let me just...

928
01:11:32,335 --> 01:11:33,802
So what's it like?

929
01:11:33,836 --> 01:11:36,327
-What?
-Out there.

930
01:11:37,773 --> 01:11:39,866
Well, it's...

931
01:11:41,110 --> 01:11:45,069
It's louder, and...

932
01:11:45,114 --> 01:11:47,514
scarier, I guess.

933
01:11:47,550 --> 01:11:51,179
And it's a lot more dangerous.

934
01:11:51,220 --> 01:11:53,120
Sounds fantastic.

935
01:11:54,523 --> 01:11:57,185
The other night, some kids
came up to go swimming...

936
01:11:57,226 --> 01:11:59,251
and they took off
all their clothes.

937
01:12:01,697 --> 01:12:04,757
Do you want some berries?

938
01:12:04,834 --> 01:12:06,802
Some berries.
I picked them myself.

939
01:12:06,836 --> 01:12:09,361
Really?

940
01:12:09,405 --> 01:12:11,373
Yeah, there's lots of stuff.

941
01:12:11,407 --> 01:12:12,669
Like what?

942
01:12:15,344 --> 01:12:17,437
Here, I'll show you.

943
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:32,350
Here.

944
01:12:32,395 --> 01:12:33,794
Go ahead. Try it.

945
01:12:47,643 --> 01:12:48,871
What are you doing?

946
01:12:48,911 --> 01:12:50,845
It's 6:30.

947
01:12:50,880 --> 01:12:52,677
So?

948
01:12:52,715 --> 01:12:55,684
We were gonna...

949
01:12:55,718 --> 01:12:57,379
You know.

950
01:12:57,420 --> 01:13:00,787
Oh, I can't.

951
01:13:01,857 --> 01:13:04,758
-Why not?
-I'm busy.

952
01:13:04,794 --> 01:13:08,730
-With what?
-I'm studying.

953
01:13:13,436 --> 01:13:14,425
Good evening.

954
01:13:14,470 --> 01:13:15,562
Good evening.

955
01:13:16,906 --> 01:13:18,203
Evening.

956
01:13:18,240 --> 01:13:20,333
-George.
-Good evening, Norm.

957
01:13:42,531 --> 01:13:43,896
Honey, I'm home.

958
01:13:56,979 --> 01:13:59,641
Honey, I'm home.

959
01:14:12,595 --> 01:14:15,029
-What was that?
-I don't know.

960
01:14:38,354 --> 01:14:40,015
What is that?

961
01:14:42,525 --> 01:14:43,719
What's going on?

962
01:14:43,759 --> 01:14:45,488
It's rain.

963
01:14:45,528 --> 01:14:46,859
Real rain?

964
01:14:47,963 --> 01:14:49,624
You don't have rain either?

965
01:14:49,665 --> 01:14:53,294
Well, of course you don't.
It's OK.

966
01:14:53,335 --> 01:14:55,667
Here, come on.

967
01:15:04,580 --> 01:15:06,741
What's going on?

968
01:15:06,782 --> 01:15:08,340
It's rain.

969
01:15:09,451 --> 01:15:11,282
It's OK. It's fine.

970
01:15:12,621 --> 01:15:14,088
There's nothing to be scared of.

971
01:15:16,525 --> 01:15:17,992
Here, I'll show you.

972
01:15:21,030 --> 01:15:23,828
It's just rain. It's OK.

973
01:15:23,866 --> 01:15:25,390
It's fine. Come on out.

974
01:15:25,434 --> 01:15:28,528
You see? Look!

975
01:15:28,571 --> 01:15:30,505
You see?

976
01:15:32,575 --> 01:15:34,634
Come on! Come on!

977
01:15:34,710 --> 01:15:35,836
It's cold.

978
01:15:45,454 --> 01:15:46,614
Cool.

979
01:15:54,563 --> 01:15:56,360
Honey, I'm home.

980
01:16:05,074 --> 01:16:07,372
Where's my dinner?

981
01:16:25,628 --> 01:16:27,619
Where's my dinner?

982
01:16:40,976 --> 01:16:43,035
Where's my dinner?

983
01:17:17,713 --> 01:17:19,442
What happened?

984
01:17:21,450 --> 01:17:23,008
Are you all right?

985
01:17:24,720 --> 01:17:25,880
What is it?

986
01:17:32,761 --> 01:17:34,422
Rain.

987
01:17:34,496 --> 01:17:36,555
Real rain?

988
01:17:42,571 --> 01:17:44,061
Oh, my God.

989
01:17:46,742 --> 01:17:48,710
Are you all right?

990
01:17:48,744 --> 01:17:52,771
I came home like I always do...

991
01:17:52,815 --> 01:17:54,840
and I went in the front door...

992
01:17:54,883 --> 01:17:56,817
and I took off my coat...

993
01:17:56,852 --> 01:17:59,184
and I put down my briefcase...

994
01:17:59,221 --> 01:18:01,985
and I said, "Honey, I'm home."

995
01:18:02,024 --> 01:18:03,992
Only there was no one there.

996
01:18:05,627 --> 01:18:07,652
No wife.

997
01:18:07,696 --> 01:18:09,129
No lights.

998
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,458
-No dinner.
-No dinner?

999
01:18:14,737 --> 01:18:16,204
I went to the oven.

1000
01:18:16,238 --> 01:18:18,832
I thought maybe she had made me
one of those TV dinners.

1001
01:18:18,874 --> 01:18:19,966
Yeah, sure.

1002
01:18:20,009 --> 01:18:21,670
She hadn't.

1003
01:18:21,710 --> 01:18:23,610
She was gone.

1004
01:18:23,645 --> 01:18:26,978
I looked and looked and looked.

1005
01:18:28,217 --> 01:18:30,014
She was gone.

1006
01:18:30,052 --> 01:18:32,816
It's gonna be fine, George.

1007
01:18:32,855 --> 01:18:34,584
You're with us now.

1008
01:18:39,061 --> 01:18:41,256
What are we gonna do, Bob?

1009
01:18:44,133 --> 01:18:45,828
Well, we're safe for now.

1010
01:18:45,868 --> 01:18:48,098
Thank goodness
we're in a bowling alley.

1011
01:18:48,137 --> 01:18:51,106
But if George here
doesn't get his dinner...

1012
01:18:51,140 --> 01:18:53,608
any one of us could be next.

1013
01:18:53,642 --> 01:18:55,507
It could be you, Gus.

1014
01:18:55,544 --> 01:18:57,512
Or you, Roy.

1015
01:18:57,579 --> 01:18:59,672
Or even you, Ralph.

1016
01:18:59,715 --> 01:19:02,047
That is real rain out there,
gentlemen.

1017
01:19:02,084 --> 01:19:06,680
This isn't some little virus
that'll clear up on its own.

1018
01:19:06,722 --> 01:19:09,316
Something is happening
to our town.

1019
01:19:10,759 --> 01:19:14,320
And I think we can all see
where it's coming from.

1020
01:19:18,200 --> 01:19:20,930
Why don't you show them
what you showed me before?

1021
01:19:24,039 --> 01:19:26,030
It's OK, Roy. Come on up here.

1022
01:19:33,148 --> 01:19:35,116
I know, Roy.

1023
01:19:42,257 --> 01:19:44,657
Thanks.

1024
01:19:45,961 --> 01:19:49,158
He asked her what she was doing.

1025
01:19:49,198 --> 01:19:51,758
She said nothing.
She was just thinking.

1026
01:19:52,868 --> 01:19:56,304
My friends, this isn't
about George's dinner.

1027
01:19:56,338 --> 01:19:59,000
It's not about Roy's shirt.

1028
01:19:59,041 --> 01:20:00,838
It's a question of values.

1029
01:20:00,876 --> 01:20:02,571
It's a question of whether...

1030
01:20:02,611 --> 01:20:05,136
we want to hold on
to those values...

1031
01:20:05,180 --> 01:20:07,944
that made this place great.

1032
01:20:07,983 --> 01:20:11,885
So a time has come
to make a decision.

1033
01:20:11,920 --> 01:20:15,720
Are we in this thing alone...

1034
01:20:15,757 --> 01:20:17,816
or are we in it together?

1035
01:20:21,663 --> 01:20:22,857
Together.

1036
01:22:16,278 --> 01:22:19,509
-I told you where I was.
-All night?

1037
01:22:19,715 --> 01:22:22,912
I got caught in the storm.
You were gone all night, too.

1038
01:22:22,951 --> 01:22:24,919
Look...

1039
01:22:24,953 --> 01:22:28,480
Let's just forget about it.
We'll just go to the meeting.

1040
01:22:28,523 --> 01:22:31,890
No. I told you, George,
I'm not going to that meeting.

1041
01:22:31,927 --> 01:22:35,158
-Sure you are.
-No, I'm not.

1042
01:22:35,197 --> 01:22:37,757
Look at me, George.

1043
01:22:37,799 --> 01:22:42,259
Look at my face.
That meeting's not for me.

1044
01:22:42,304 --> 01:22:44,238
You'll put on some makeup.

1045
01:22:44,273 --> 01:22:46,241
I don't want
to put on some makeup.

1046
01:22:46,308 --> 01:22:50,074
It goes away. It'll go away.

1047
01:22:50,112 --> 01:22:54,344
I don't want it to go away.

1048
01:22:58,053 --> 01:23:00,453
Now, you listen to me.

1049
01:23:03,759 --> 01:23:05,522
You're coming to this meeting.

1050
01:23:05,560 --> 01:23:07,892
You're going to put on
some makeup.

1051
01:23:07,929 --> 01:23:10,523
You're going to be home
at 6:00 every night...

1052
01:23:10,565 --> 01:23:14,023
and you're going to have dinner
ready on this table.

1053
01:23:16,872 --> 01:23:21,104
No, I'm not, sweetie.

1054
01:23:30,285 --> 01:23:32,981
I made you a meat loaf.

1055
01:23:34,956 --> 01:23:38,983
Put it in the oven and turn
this little knob up to 350.

1056
01:23:40,228 --> 01:23:43,197
If you put the pie in
40 minutes later...

1057
01:23:43,231 --> 01:23:45,927
it'll be hot
in time for dessert.

1058
01:23:48,036 --> 01:23:52,530
I made a couple of lunches
for you for tomorrow...

1059
01:23:52,574 --> 01:23:55,907
and put them
in brown paper bags.

1060
01:23:59,915 --> 01:24:02,110
I'm going to go now.

1061
01:24:02,150 --> 01:24:03,378
Where are you gonna go?

1062
01:24:05,320 --> 01:24:07,083
I'm going to go now.

1063
01:24:10,492 --> 01:24:14,258
Don't go out there like that.
They'll see you.

1064
01:24:14,296 --> 01:24:16,093
They'll see you.

1065
01:24:16,131 --> 01:24:19,100
Betty, come back here!

1066
01:24:19,134 --> 01:24:21,568
It's beautiful. Can I open it?

1067
01:24:21,603 --> 01:24:22,934
Sure.

1068
01:24:26,608 --> 01:24:28,166
Where'd you get it?

1069
01:24:28,243 --> 01:24:30,507
It was a prop
from the school play.

1070
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:36,450
Thank you.

1071
01:24:51,233 --> 01:24:52,962
Whitey.

1072
01:24:53,001 --> 01:24:56,937
Hey, Bud, why aren't you
at the town meeting right now?

1073
01:24:56,972 --> 01:24:58,564
No reason. How come you're not?

1074
01:24:58,607 --> 01:25:03,010
We're supposed to go around
and let everyone know about it.

1075
01:25:03,044 --> 01:25:05,410
I thought maybe it was
because you were too busy...

1076
01:25:05,447 --> 01:25:08,905
entertaining
your colored girlfriend.

1077
01:25:08,950 --> 01:25:11,316
Why don't you guys
get the hell out of here?

1078
01:25:11,353 --> 01:25:14,686
All right. We'll do that.

1079
01:25:16,224 --> 01:25:19,594
Margaret, you can come over and
make those oatmeal cookies...

1080
01:25:19,594 --> 01:25:21,425
for me anytime you want to.

1081
01:25:27,936 --> 01:25:29,198
People.

1082
01:25:30,439 --> 01:25:31,565
People!

1083
01:25:31,606 --> 01:25:34,074
Roy Campbell's
got a blue front door.

1084
01:25:34,109 --> 01:25:37,044
-It's always been blue.
-People.

1085
01:25:37,078 --> 01:25:40,138
People, please.

1086
01:25:40,182 --> 01:25:41,513
Please.

1087
01:25:43,919 --> 01:25:46,444
I think we all know
what's been going on here.

1088
01:25:46,488 --> 01:25:48,149
Up until now...

1089
01:25:48,190 --> 01:25:53,958
everything around here has
always been, well, pleasant.

1090
01:25:53,995 --> 01:25:57,658
Recently, certain things
have become unpleasant.

1091
01:25:58,934 --> 01:26:02,392
Now, it seems to me...

1092
01:26:02,437 --> 01:26:05,031
that the first thing
we have to do...

1093
01:26:05,073 --> 01:26:08,133
is to separate out the things
that are pleasant...

1094
01:26:08,176 --> 01:26:10,303
from the things
that are unpleasant.

1095
01:27:15,410 --> 01:27:17,708
That's Betty Parker, isn't it?

1096
01:27:17,746 --> 01:27:19,737
That is an outrage.

1097
01:27:36,431 --> 01:27:38,831
What the hell
do you think you're doing?

1098
01:27:39,034 --> 01:27:41,366
Get in here. Now!

1099
01:27:44,639 --> 01:27:46,539
You think this is a toy?

1100
01:27:46,575 --> 01:27:49,703
You think it's your own little
goddamn coloring book?

1101
01:27:49,744 --> 01:27:51,109
It just sort of happened.

1102
01:27:51,146 --> 01:27:53,205
A deluge doesn't just happen.

1103
01:27:53,248 --> 01:27:55,307
Bolts of lightning
don't just happen.

1104
01:27:55,350 --> 01:27:57,181
I didn't do anything wrong.

1105
01:27:57,218 --> 01:27:59,618
Oh, no?
Let me show you something.

1106
01:27:59,654 --> 01:28:02,088
Go on, try it.

1107
01:28:03,158 --> 01:28:06,685
Boom ! Right there!
What do you call that?

1108
01:28:06,728 --> 01:28:08,719
You don't deserve this place.

1109
01:28:08,763 --> 01:28:11,391
You don't deserve
to live in this paradise.

1110
01:28:11,433 --> 01:28:13,128
Where's the remote control
I gave you?

1111
01:28:13,168 --> 01:28:14,294
Why?

1112
01:28:14,336 --> 01:28:15,860
Because you're coming home,
you little twerp...

1113
01:28:16,071 --> 01:28:18,699
and I'm gonna put this place
back the way it was.

1114
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:21,072
I can't let you do that.

1115
01:28:21,109 --> 01:28:23,077
I'm sorry.
I'm not gonna let you do that.

1116
01:28:23,111 --> 01:28:25,636
Just give me the damn remote!

1117
01:28:25,680 --> 01:28:26,806
I'm gonna go now.

1118
01:28:26,848 --> 01:28:27,872
You're not going anywhere.

1119
01:28:28,083 --> 01:28:30,574
You're gonna get that remote
and come home...

1120
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:34,122
and we're gonna make
everybody happy again.

1121
01:28:34,122 --> 01:28:36,522
Where you going in such a hurry?

1122
01:28:36,558 --> 01:28:38,827
That's not real friendly.

1123
01:28:38,827 --> 01:28:42,092
Let's see if
she looks like her picture.

1124
01:28:42,130 --> 01:28:44,360
You want to be friendly,
don't you?

1125
01:28:44,399 --> 01:28:47,197
Why don't you show us what's
under that nice blue dress?

1126
01:28:47,235 --> 01:28:48,793
Yeah, come on!

1127
01:28:51,139 --> 01:28:54,233
Where you going?
There's nowhere to go.

1128
01:28:55,276 --> 01:28:58,302
That is a lovely shade of blue.

1129
01:28:58,346 --> 01:29:01,315
Don't you think
that's a lovely shade of blue?

1130
01:29:13,428 --> 01:29:15,828
Get out of here!

1131
01:29:15,864 --> 01:29:18,662
Go on! Get out of here!

1132
01:29:22,137 --> 01:29:23,399
Are you OK?

1133
01:29:29,277 --> 01:29:31,643
What?

1134
01:30:59,033 --> 01:31:01,331
It's OK. He's not in there.

1135
01:31:14,983 --> 01:31:17,952
It's OK. All right?

1136
01:31:17,986 --> 01:31:21,513
I'm gonna get you out of here,
all right?

1137
01:31:21,556 --> 01:31:22,750
Are you OK?

1138
01:31:26,327 --> 01:31:27,760
Keep 'em coming!

1139
01:31:35,570 --> 01:31:37,697
No, Mary Sue,
it's better this way.

1140
01:31:37,739 --> 01:31:40,071
This is the only book I've ever
read in my whole life...

1141
01:31:40,275 --> 01:31:42,334
and you're not gonna put it
on that fire!

1142
01:31:42,377 --> 01:31:44,038
Just give me the book!

1143
01:31:50,819 --> 01:31:53,014
It's me.

1144
01:32:24,752 --> 01:32:26,515
Let's go inside.

1145
01:32:52,914 --> 01:32:56,441
Just thought
I'd try to tidy it up a bit.

1146
01:33:03,091 --> 01:33:07,391
It's OK. It's OK.

1147
01:33:07,428 --> 01:33:10,363
Once we sweep it up,
it'll be all right again.

1148
01:33:19,574 --> 01:33:22,600
He's right. Let's...

1149
01:33:22,644 --> 01:33:24,407
Help me with this, will you?

1150
01:33:24,445 --> 01:33:25,776
Sure.

1151
01:33:25,813 --> 01:33:29,112
Good. Put this up in here.

1152
01:33:32,553 --> 01:33:34,578
People!

1153
01:33:36,958 --> 01:33:38,084
People!

1154
01:33:40,595 --> 01:33:44,053
This is not the answer, people.

1155
01:33:44,098 --> 01:33:46,760
No matter how upset
we may get...

1156
01:33:46,801 --> 01:33:49,668
or how frustrated we may be...

1157
01:33:49,704 --> 01:33:52,730
we're not gonna solve
our problems out in the street.

1158
01:33:52,774 --> 01:33:55,174
It's just the wrong way
to do it.

1159
01:33:55,209 --> 01:33:58,110
We have to find
a code of conduct...

1160
01:33:58,146 --> 01:34:00,614
that we can all agree
to live by.

1161
01:34:00,648 --> 01:34:05,483
I asked George and Ralph here
to sketch out a few ideas...

1162
01:34:05,520 --> 01:34:08,978
and I think they've done
a terrific job.

1163
01:34:09,023 --> 01:34:11,890
If we can all agree to these,
we can take a vote...

1164
01:34:11,926 --> 01:34:15,418
and I think we can start off
in the right direction.

1165
01:34:15,463 --> 01:34:21,424
"One--all public disruption
and acts of vandalism...

1166
01:34:21,469 --> 01:34:23,596
"are to cease immediately.

1167
01:34:23,638 --> 01:34:27,699
"Two--all citizens
of Pleasantville...

1168
01:34:27,742 --> 01:34:29,710
"are to treat each other...

1169
01:34:29,744 --> 01:34:32,770
"in a courteous
and pleasant manner."

1170
01:34:32,814 --> 01:34:36,841
"Courteous and pleasant manner."
That's not too bad.

1171
01:34:36,884 --> 01:34:40,786
"Three--the area commonly known
as Lovers Lane...

1172
01:34:40,822 --> 01:34:43,222
"as well as the Pleasantville
public library...

1173
01:34:43,257 --> 01:34:45,521
"shall be closed
until further notice."

1174
01:34:48,997 --> 01:34:51,227
"Four--the only permissible
recorded music...

1175
01:34:51,265 --> 01:34:53,096
"shall be the following:

1176
01:34:53,134 --> 01:34:55,932

"the marches

1178
01:34:58,139 --> 01:35:00,130
"or The Star-Spangled Banner.

1179
01:35:00,174 --> 01:35:03,075
"In no event
shall any music be tolerated...

1180
01:35:03,111 --> 01:35:05,944
"that is not of a temperate

1181
01:35:07,548 --> 01:35:12,576
"Five--there shall be
no public sale of umbrellas...

1182
01:35:12,620 --> 01:35:15,987
"or preparation for

1183
01:35:18,126 --> 01:35:22,654
"Six--no bed frame

1184
01:35:22,697 --> 01:35:23,994
"measuring

01:35:26,667 --> 01:35:30,763

01:35:34,942 --> 01:35:37,968
"despite the recent availability

1188
01:35:39,914 --> 01:35:44,112
"Eight--all elementary
and high school curriculum...

1189
01:35:44,152 --> 01:35:47,178
"shall teach the non-changeist
view of history...

1190
01:35:47,221 --> 01:35:51,624
"emphasizing continuity

1191
01:35:53,594 --> 01:35:54,993
Wow.

1192
01:35:57,598 --> 01:35:59,065
Hey...

1193
01:35:59,100 --> 01:36:00,567
this thing still works.

1194
01:36:01,702 --> 01:36:02,726
Turn that off!

1195
01:36:02,770 --> 01:36:04,897
You're not allowed
to do that now!

1196
01:36:11,813 --> 01:36:12,973
Sure you are.

1197
01:37:20,381 --> 01:37:22,941
Wow, this is good.

1198
01:37:22,984 --> 01:37:24,918
You just do it?

1199
01:37:30,958 --> 01:37:32,687
Don't worry.
We'll get you a new one.

1200
01:37:32,727 --> 01:37:37,687
I don't know what I'd do
if I couldn't paint anymore.

1201
01:37:45,706 --> 01:37:48,038
Maybe I have an idea.

1202
01:38:35,323 --> 01:38:36,347
Shameless.

1203
01:39:59,206 --> 01:40:01,436
When are they gonna
let them out?

1204
01:40:01,475 --> 01:40:04,069
Hey, what are you kids
doing out there?

1205
01:40:06,514 --> 01:40:08,448
There's someone to see you, Bud.

1206
01:40:17,792 --> 01:40:19,193
Is this a bad time?

1207
01:40:19,193 --> 01:40:21,559
No, it's fine. Come on in.

1208
01:40:24,231 --> 01:40:25,960
I brought you something.

1209
01:40:26,000 --> 01:40:28,400
Thank you.

1210
01:40:28,436 --> 01:40:31,098
-Cocktail olives.
-Everything else was frozen.

1211
01:40:31,138 --> 01:40:32,935
I didn't know how to--

1212
01:40:32,973 --> 01:40:34,304
I appreciate it.

1213
01:40:38,579 --> 01:40:41,605
-Your mom went out.
-Went out?

1214
01:40:41,816 --> 01:40:43,977
Yeah.
She went out for a little while.

1215
01:40:44,018 --> 01:40:45,849
When?

1216
01:40:45,886 --> 01:40:49,219
Three days ago.

1217
01:40:54,295 --> 01:40:57,196
Jeez, everything is so cockeyed.

1218
01:40:57,231 --> 01:40:59,995
I didn't even know
it was Tuesday.

1219
01:41:00,034 --> 01:41:02,502
Tuesday we play bridge
with the Jenkins.

1220
01:41:02,536 --> 01:41:05,471
There was no bridge. It's--

1221
01:41:08,909 --> 01:41:11,104
Can I have one of those?

1222
01:41:11,145 --> 01:41:12,908
Sure. Yeah. You hungry?

1223
01:41:12,947 --> 01:41:18,078
Mrs. Benson was making
meat loaf next door.

1224
01:41:18,119 --> 01:41:20,178
I almost climbed in
her kitchen window.

1225
01:41:24,625 --> 01:41:27,992
What happened?
One minute, everything's fine.

1226
01:41:28,028 --> 01:41:30,019
The next...

1227
01:41:32,066 --> 01:41:33,499
What went wrong?

1228
01:41:33,534 --> 01:41:37,061
Nothing went wrong.
People change.

1229
01:41:37,104 --> 01:41:38,469
People change?

1230
01:41:38,506 --> 01:41:40,872
Yeah, people change.

1231
01:41:40,908 --> 01:41:43,376
Can they change back?

1232
01:41:47,181 --> 01:41:49,445
I don't know.
I think it's harder.

1233
01:41:53,421 --> 01:41:54,581
You OK?

1234
01:41:56,957 --> 01:41:59,653
Yeah. Not fair, you know?

1235
01:41:59,693 --> 01:42:01,684
You get used to one thing and--

1236
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:04,523
I know. It's not.

1237
01:42:08,169 --> 01:42:11,002
Bud Parker, William Johnson...

1238
01:42:11,038 --> 01:42:14,030
you are charged with desecration
of a public building...

1239
01:42:14,074 --> 01:42:16,406
and with the intentional use
of prohibited paint colors...

1240
01:42:16,444 --> 01:42:18,435
in violation of the
Pleasantville code of conduct...

1241
01:42:18,479 --> 01:42:20,276
and laws of common decency.

1242
01:42:20,314 --> 01:42:22,908
Do you admit
that on the night of May 1st...

1243
01:42:22,950 --> 01:42:24,645
you did willfully
and consciously apply...

1244
01:42:24,685 --> 01:42:26,619
the following
forbidden paint colors...

1245
01:42:26,654 --> 01:42:29,589
to the north wall of the
Pleasantville police station...

1246
01:42:29,623 --> 01:42:32,717
red, pink, vermilion, puce,
chartreuse...

1247
01:42:32,927 --> 01:42:37,091
umber, blue, aqua, oxblood,
green, peach, crimson...

1248
01:42:37,131 --> 01:42:40,294
yellow, olive, and magenta?

1249
01:42:40,334 --> 01:42:43,462
Yeah, I do. Where's our lawyer?

1250
01:42:43,504 --> 01:42:46,064
I think we want to keep
these proceedings...

1251
01:42:46,106 --> 01:42:48,006
as pleasant as possible.

1252
01:42:48,042 --> 01:42:50,135
I don't think a lawyer
will be necessary.

1253
01:42:53,314 --> 01:42:56,545
Do you further admit
that this unnatural depiction...

1254
01:42:56,584 --> 01:42:59,144
occurred in full public view
where it was accessible to...

1255
01:42:59,186 --> 01:43:01,450
and in plain sight
of minor children?

1256
01:43:01,489 --> 01:43:04,049
It was accessible to everyone.

1257
01:43:04,091 --> 01:43:07,060
Let the record show that
the defendants have answered...

1258
01:43:07,094 --> 01:43:09,289
in the affirmative
to all charges.

1259
01:43:11,031 --> 01:43:12,498
Do you have anything
to say in your defense?

1260
01:43:12,533 --> 01:43:15,001
Yeah, I do--

1261
01:43:18,973 --> 01:43:22,136
I didn't mean to hurt anybody.

1262
01:43:26,680 --> 01:43:30,741
Maybe if I painted
something different.

1263
01:43:30,784 --> 01:43:33,514
Or maybe I could use
less colors or something.

1264
01:43:33,554 --> 01:43:37,388
Or, you know, certain colors.
Or maybe I could--

1265
01:43:37,424 --> 01:43:40,450
You could pick out
the colors beforehand...

1266
01:43:40,528 --> 01:43:42,359
and then they wouldn't
bother anybody.

1267
01:43:42,396 --> 01:43:45,365
-I've got something to say.
-Very well.

1268
01:43:45,399 --> 01:43:47,390
You don't have a right
to do this.

1269
01:43:50,337 --> 01:43:52,999
I mean...

1270
01:43:53,040 --> 01:43:55,201
I know you want it
to stay pleasant around here...

1271
01:43:55,242 --> 01:44:00,612
but there are so many things...

1272
01:44:00,648 --> 01:44:02,741
that are so much better.

1273
01:44:02,783 --> 01:44:07,083
Like silly or sexy...

1274
01:44:07,121 --> 01:44:11,683
or dangerous or brief.

1275
01:44:11,725 --> 01:44:17,561
And every one of those things
is in you all the time...

1276
01:44:17,598 --> 01:44:19,532
if you just have the guts
to look for them.

1277
01:44:19,567 --> 01:44:21,034
That's enough.

1278
01:44:21,068 --> 01:44:22,660
I thought I was allowed
to defend myself.

1279
01:44:22,703 --> 01:44:25,035
-You're not allowed to lie.
-I'm not lying.

1280
01:44:25,072 --> 01:44:29,532
You see those faces up there?
They're no different than you.

1281
01:44:29,577 --> 01:44:31,636
They just see something
inside themselves--

1282
01:44:31,679 --> 01:44:33,840
I said that's enough.

1283
01:44:34,048 --> 01:44:35,675
I'll show you. Dad?

1284
01:44:35,716 --> 01:44:37,775
Yeah, Bud?

1285
01:44:37,818 --> 01:44:43,085
It's OK, Dad.
Just listen for a sec.

1286
01:44:43,123 --> 01:44:44,818
I know you miss her.

1287
01:44:44,858 --> 01:44:48,385
I mean, you told me you did...

1288
01:44:48,429 --> 01:44:53,366
but maybe it's not just
the cooking or the cleaning...

1289
01:44:53,434 --> 01:44:55,698
that you miss.

1290
01:44:55,736 --> 01:44:59,263
Maybe it's something else.

1291
01:44:59,306 --> 01:45:03,709
Maybe you can't even
describe it.

1292
01:45:03,744 --> 01:45:06,577
Maybe you only know it
when it's gone.

1293
01:45:08,515 --> 01:45:11,882
Maybe it's like
there's a whole piece of you...

1294
01:45:12,086 --> 01:45:13,280
that's missing, too.

1295
01:45:18,692 --> 01:45:20,455
Look at her, Dad.

1296
01:45:24,732 --> 01:45:26,529
Doesn't she look pretty
like that?

1297
01:45:28,802 --> 01:45:33,296
Doesn't she look
just as beautiful...

1298
01:45:33,340 --> 01:45:35,240
as the first time you met her?

1299
01:45:37,511 --> 01:45:40,344
You really want her back
the way she was?

1300
01:45:49,657 --> 01:45:51,852
Doesn't she look wonderful?

1301
01:45:56,430 --> 01:46:01,390
Now, don't you wish
you could tell her that?

1302
01:46:12,312 --> 01:46:14,212
You're out of order.

1303
01:46:14,248 --> 01:46:16,239
Why am I out of order?

1304
01:46:16,283 --> 01:46:18,547
I'm not gonna let you turn
this courtroom into a circus.

1305
01:46:18,585 --> 01:46:21,713
I don't think it's a circus.
I don't think they do, either.

1306
01:46:24,158 --> 01:46:26,388
This behavior must stop at once.

1307
01:46:26,427 --> 01:46:28,725
That's just the point.

1308
01:46:28,762 --> 01:46:30,525
It can't stop at once
because it's in you...

1309
01:46:30,564 --> 01:46:33,328
and you can't stop
something inside you.

1310
01:46:33,367 --> 01:46:34,664
It is not inside me.

1311
01:46:34,702 --> 01:46:36,761
-Sure it is.
-No, it is not.

1312
01:46:40,307 --> 01:46:42,241
What do you want to do to me
right now?

1313
01:46:42,276 --> 01:46:46,906
Come on.
Everyone is turning colors.

1314
01:46:46,947 --> 01:46:49,177
Kids are making out
in the street.

1315
01:46:49,216 --> 01:46:52,413
No one is getting their dinner.
Hell, you could have a flood.

1316
01:46:52,453 --> 01:46:54,978
Pretty soon, the women
could be going off to work...

1317
01:46:55,189 --> 01:46:57,282
while the men stayed at home
and cooked.

1318
01:46:57,324 --> 01:46:59,588
-That is not going to happen.
-But it could!

1319
01:46:59,626 --> 01:47:01,594
No, it could not!

1320
01:47:34,895 --> 01:47:37,625
Hey, look at this!

1321
01:48:21,441 --> 01:48:23,375
What an image.

1322
01:48:23,410 --> 01:48:24,707
Shut up.

1323
01:49:15,696 --> 01:49:17,926
You sure you don't
want to come home?

1324
01:49:17,965 --> 01:49:20,957
Yeah. I gotta do this
for a little while.

1325
01:49:21,034 --> 01:49:23,059
Besides, you think
I even have a chance...

1326
01:49:23,103 --> 01:49:25,731
of getting into college
back there?

1327
01:49:25,772 --> 01:49:27,069
Honestly?

1328
01:49:31,712 --> 01:49:34,772
-Got your admissions letter?
-Right here.

1329
01:49:36,817 --> 01:49:39,479
I did the slut thing, David.

1330
01:49:39,553 --> 01:49:41,783
Got kinda old.

1331
01:49:43,523 --> 01:49:45,514
I'll come back
and check on you soon.

1332
01:50:02,576 --> 01:50:05,704
You turned into
a pretty cool guy.

1333
01:50:05,746 --> 01:50:08,647
How'd that happen?

1334
01:50:08,682 --> 01:50:09,842
I don't know.

1335
01:50:12,185 --> 01:50:13,482
I'll see you.

1336
01:50:35,208 --> 01:50:37,403
Just don't forget about me.

1337
01:50:37,444 --> 01:50:41,574
Even if you never come back.

1338
01:50:41,615 --> 01:50:43,173
I just don't want you
to forget about me.

1339
01:50:43,216 --> 01:50:44,911
I couldn't do that.

1340
01:50:54,594 --> 01:50:57,927
-Here.
-What's this?

1341
01:50:57,965 --> 01:51:00,934
Lots of stuff.
A meat loaf sandwich...

1342
01:51:00,968 --> 01:51:02,993
And a hard-boiled egg...

1343
01:51:03,036 --> 01:51:05,561
and some marshmallow
rice squares.

1344
01:51:07,808 --> 01:51:11,608
There's some fried chicken
in there, too.

1345
01:51:13,981 --> 01:51:16,609
Don't skip dinner just 'cause
you're not here anymore.

1346
01:51:16,650 --> 01:51:19,118
I won't.
I thought you weren't--

1347
01:51:19,152 --> 01:51:21,916
I had to come say good-bye.

1348
01:51:28,996 --> 01:51:32,124
Just wear this on the trip...

1349
01:51:32,165 --> 01:51:35,931
in case it gets cold.

1350
01:51:35,969 --> 01:51:37,664
It's a pretty short trip.

1351
01:51:37,704 --> 01:51:39,569
Still...

1352
01:51:50,717 --> 01:51:53,185
I am just so proud of you.

1353
01:51:53,220 --> 01:51:54,949
Thanks.

1354
01:51:58,892 --> 01:52:00,189
I know.

1355
01:52:00,227 --> 01:52:01,785
I love you, too.

1356
01:52:11,671 --> 01:52:13,161
Well...

1357
01:52:15,008 --> 01:52:17,636
Well...

1358
01:52:17,677 --> 01:52:20,305
I guess you better stand back.

1359
01:53:15,135 --> 01:53:17,865
That concludes the first hour
of the Pleasantville marathon.

1360
01:53:17,904 --> 01:53:19,030
Don't forget...

1361
01:53:19,072 --> 01:53:20,835
we'll be going all night long
until noon tomorrow--

1362
01:54:00,647 --> 01:54:02,638
I thought you went out of town.

1363
01:54:02,682 --> 01:54:04,309
Came back.

1364
01:54:09,723 --> 01:54:11,247
What's wrong?

1365
01:54:11,291 --> 01:54:14,351
I don't know.
Everything's so fucked up.

1366
01:54:14,394 --> 01:54:18,160
I got halfway down there
and thought, "What am I doing?"

1367
01:54:18,198 --> 01:54:20,223
He's nine years younger
than I am.

1368
01:54:20,267 --> 01:54:22,827
Doesn't make me feel younger.
Makes me feel older.

1369
01:54:26,339 --> 01:54:29,900
When your father was here,
I used to think this was it.

1370
01:54:29,943 --> 01:54:31,706
This was the way
it was always going to be.

1371
01:54:31,745 --> 01:54:33,940
I had the right house,
the right car...

1372
01:54:33,980 --> 01:54:35,971
the right life--

1373
01:54:36,016 --> 01:54:38,746
There is no right house,
there is no right car.

1374
01:54:42,422 --> 01:54:44,754
God, my face must be a mess.

1375
01:54:45,792 --> 01:54:47,282
It looks great.

1376
01:54:47,327 --> 01:54:51,388
That's really sweet, but
I'm sure it does not look great.

1377
01:54:51,431 --> 01:54:52,989
Sure, it does.

1378
01:55:00,740 --> 01:55:02,298
Come here.

1379
01:55:04,077 --> 01:55:06,944
I'm 40. It's not supposed
to be like this.

1380
01:55:06,980 --> 01:55:09,813
It's not supposed
to be anything.

1381
01:55:09,849 --> 01:55:11,077
Hold still.

1382
01:55:15,055 --> 01:55:17,717
How'd you get so smart
all of a sudden?

1383
01:55:20,894 --> 01:55:23,328
I had a good day.

1384
01:56:01,534 --> 01:56:03,126
So what's gonna happen now?

1385
01:56:08,875 --> 01:56:10,843
I don't know.

1386
01:56:10,877 --> 01:56:13,368
Do you know
what's going to happen now?

1387
01:56:15,482 --> 01:56:18,178
No. I don't.

1388
01:56:32,565 --> 01:56:34,465
I guess I don't, either.

1389
01:56:40,000 --> 01:56:50,000
