Now, you look like an adaptable girl.

362
00:17:25,500 --> 00:17:26,541
It's Kat.

363
00:17:26,625 --> 00:17:30,958
Well, come on up, Kat.
Get a close-up of this marvelous mollusk!

364

373
00:18:01,041 --> 00:18:02,041
[nun] Okay.

374
00:18:03,500 --> 00:18:05,958
Slow, deep breaths, Kat.

[breathing slows]

376
00:18:07,791 --> 00:18:10,166
Um, let's take a look.

377
00:18:13,625 --> 00:18:15,500
- Oh!
- [Kat gasps]

378
00:18:15,583 --> 00:18:17,333
What's... What's on my hand?

379
00:18:18,166 --> 00:18:22,208
Ah, okay.
You've never seen this before, right?

380
00:18:22,291 --> 00:18:23,291
Never.

381
00:18:23,958 --> 00:18:28,291
Uh, well, the mark proves
that you're special, Kat.

382
00:18:29,041 --> 00:18:31,458
But it has to be our secret.

383
00:18:31,541 --> 00:18:32,583
Huh?

384
00:18:32,666 --> 00:18:35,875
- [nun] That's how I can protect you.
- Protect me from what?

385
00:18:36,375 --> 00:18:38,958
That stupid octopus. It bit me, right?

386
00:18:39,041 --> 00:18:42,000
- It wasn't the octopus.
- You're just protecting your job!

387

Tell no one, Kat!

388
00:18:48,083 --> 00:18:51,750
So, what do we believe
just happened? Sweetie?

389
00:18:51,833 --> 00:18:54,000
{\an8}[gasps softly] Kay-Kay is a sorceress!

390
00:18:54,083 --> 00:18:58,458
No, she's clearly telekinetic.
Her mind can move matter.

391
00:18:58,541 --> 00:19:02,208
Well, I would posit
that Kay-Kay is an interrupter.

392

393
00:19:04,583 --> 00:19:07,583
Oh, come on, Siobhan, leave her alone.

394
00:19:09,250 --> 00:19:11,041

401
00:19:29,541 --> 00:19:31,583
I was braggin' to the wrong demon.

402
00:19:32,166 --> 00:19:34,291
Duh! When Belzer found out,

403
00:19:34,375 --> 00:19:37,250
he called this an insurrection,
a rebellion!

404
00:19:37,833 --> 00:19:39,541
Now, we're stuck here for life!

405
00:19:39,625 --> 00:19:41,625

00:20:34,541 --> 00:20:37,958
Imagine! She could summon us
to the Land of the Living!

425
00:20:38,041 --> 00:20:41,708
But... But demons aren't allowed up there.
I mean, Belzer claims it's dangerous.

426
00:20:41,791 --> 00:20:45,166
Dangerous? Wild, he never even been there.

427
00:20:45,750 --> 00:20:49,333
Then that's where we'll build our faire!

428

What?! [laughs]

429
00:20:52,500 --> 00:20:55,750
{\an8}That's amazing, Wild. You're right!
He would never know.

Shh! Not so loud.
We're right under his nose!

432
00:21:02,250 --> 00:21:03,500
So what do we do now?

433
00:21:03,583 --> 00:21:06,500
Think it's time to see our Hell Maiden.
Got any spare hair cream?

Sweet Siobhan told Mummy all about her.

Now the state's paying <i>him</i>
to take in criminals.

452
00:21:55,458 --> 00:22:00,583
That's our business model, Bests.
How dare you compete with Klax Korp!

453
00:22:00,666 --> 00:22:06,041
[laughs nervously] Well, technically,
it's not competing if you have no prison.

- [grumbles]
- He's right, Lane.

455
00:22:08,333 --> 00:22:11,583

to win the vote.

Oh, yes, uh, the old-guard members.
They would vote for you!

[Wilma] Listen, listen to me, Kat.

535
00:26:48,583 --> 00:26:51,583
You need to swim like we taught you.
All the way up.

536
00:26:51,666 --> 00:26:53,791
- Aren't you coming?
- Right behind you, baby!

537
00:26:53,875 --> 00:26:55,000
Mama, I'm scared!

538
00:26:55,083 --> 00:26:58,875

Who are you?
What are you doing in my dream?

550

Greetings, Hell Maiden!

551
00:27:37,750 --> 00:27:38,750
Me?

552
00:27:38,833 --> 00:27:40,916
Uh… [clears throat]
You... You've got the mark, right?

[nun] <i>Tell no one, Kat!</i>

554
00:27:43,333 --> 00:27:45,625
What mark? I don't have a mark.

555
00:27:45,708 --> 00:27:46,791
Sure, you do.

556
00:27:47,583 --> 00:27:48,583
It's right there.

557
00:27:49,333 --> 00:27:50,208
Hey!

- What do you want?
- [Wendell gasps]

559
00:27:52,291 --> 00:27:54,750
We are Wendell and Wild.

560
00:27:54,833 --> 00:27:57,500
- Your personal demons.
- Who?

561
00:27:57,583 --> 00:27:59,583
Well, you can summon us
to the Land of the Living.

562
00:27:59,666 --> 00:28:02,416
- Why would I do that?
- 'Cause we'll give you whatever you want.

563
00:28:03,000 --> 00:28:05,958
{\an8}Huh. Only thing I want is my parents.

564
00:28:06,875 --> 00:28:08,166
{\an8}And they're dead.

565
00:28:08,250 --> 00:28:10,166
Uh-huh. Conference.

566
00:28:10,666 --> 00:28:13,916
- We can't raise the dead.
- Well, we do know how to lie.

567
00:28:14,000 --> 00:28:15,750
Oh! I like that plan.

568
00:28:16,333 --> 00:28:19,250
- No problemo!
- That's right! You do your bit…

569
00:28:19,333 --> 00:28:21,333
And we'll bring 'em back alive.

570
00:28:21,958 --> 00:28:23,125
That's ridiculous.

571
00:28:23,208 --> 00:28:25,333
- Well, I mean...
- What do you got to lose?

572

[breathes deeply]

573
00:28:28,625 --> 00:28:30,958
{\an8}Fine. So what do I do?

574
00:28:31,041 --> 00:28:35,083
- Okay, now, first, find Bearz-a-bub.
- [Kat] What's a Bearz-a-bub?

575
00:28:35,166 --> 00:28:38,041
Finds Hell Maidens for demons.
Found you for us.

576
00:28:38,125 --> 00:28:40,375
- Well, it marked your hand so we'd know.
- [Kat] Then what?

577
00:28:40,458 --> 00:28:44,000
Then, you take it
to the grave site next full moon.

578
00:28:44,083 --> 00:28:47,083
- It'll tell you what to do.
- [Wendell] Oh, yeah, one more thing!

579
00:28:47,166 --> 00:28:49,333

Oh, Helley.

You should have returned it.

What, the... the Nigerian Prince?

636

[Wild] Yeah. He said
if we helped him escape, he'd...

637
00:32:20,416 --> 00:32:23,250
[Wendell] That's nothing but a scam, Wild!

638
00:32:23,333 --> 00:32:25,250
[Wild] That's sound financial planning!

639
00:32:25,333 --> 00:32:28,541
How 'bout I snap your horns off,
rub 'em together, and make a fire?

- All right, okay!

We got a serious problem to solve,

See, Wendell?

657
00:33:18,541 --> 00:33:22,416
I bet folks would pay a lot
to come back from the dead, right?

658
00:33:23,291 --> 00:33:25,916
Yeah, sure, only that was just a tick.

659
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:29,000
We need to test the cream
on something bigger.

We'll dig up her parents
and test the cream!

And if it works?

671
00:34:02,250 --> 00:34:06,291
There'll be plenty of dough
to build our faire! [laughs]

Kay-Kay, sometimes it's harder
to let go when you've just met.

00:35:26,583 --> 00:35:27,791
No, it's not.

690

Maybe he was just trying
to save the school.

Not Kay-Kay! Not my custom.

00:45:24,208 --> 00:45:25,958
Is our secret safe?

884
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:27,333
[grumbles]

885

[slithering]

886
00:45:29,791 --> 00:45:32,375
I know what you are, Kat.
You're a Hell Maiden.

887
00:45:32,958 --> 00:45:34,416
But how could you know that?

888
00:45:34,500 --> 00:45:37,166
I'm… kind of an expert.

889
00:45:38,125 --> 00:45:41,916
And you do not want
certain parties finding out about you.

890
00:45:42,791 --> 00:45:44,333
Why do you care about me?

891
00:45:44,833 --> 00:45:47,875
I care because I was just like you.

892
00:45:47,958 --> 00:45:50,166
[Kat] Oh, so you were stupid too!

893
00:45:50,250 --> 00:45:54,041
- You aren't stupid, Kat.
- Stupid enough to get my parents killed!

894
00:45:54,125 --> 00:45:56,125
Stupid enough to just watch 'em drown,

895
00:45:56,208 --> 00:45:59,333
not even try to help!
Stupid enough to believe they could ever...

896
00:45:59,416 --> 00:46:02,291
Stop! It couldn't have
all been your fault, Kat.

897
00:46:02,375 --> 00:46:04,416
You're nothing like me!

898
00:46:04,500 --> 00:46:06,375

We were so worried, Kay-Kay,
when you didn't get on the bus.

902
00:46:18,916 --> 00:46:21,541
- Where were you?
- You gonna arrest me, Klax Korp?

903
00:46:21,625 --> 00:46:24,541
- Arrest you?
- You <i>are</i> the prison people.

904
00:46:24,625 --> 00:46:26,958
Why, yes, private prisons.

905
00:46:27,041 --> 00:46:30,375
With trauma therapy,
full detox, and whole-being cleanses.

906
00:46:30,458 --> 00:46:32,500
You ever been inside a private prison?

907
00:46:33,000 --> 00:46:33,958
Well, no.

00:46:40,041 --> 00:46:41,125
I didn't think so.

912
00:46:48,250 --> 00:46:49,250
[Sloane] It's the cutest.

913
00:46:49,333 --> 00:46:50,750
That dream you had…

914
00:46:53,625 --> 00:46:57,041
{\an8}Maybe it was just some students
messing with you.

915
00:46:57,125 --> 00:46:59,791
{\an8}I said they were demons, Raúl!

916
00:46:59,875 --> 00:47:02,750
My personal demons. And they lied!

917
00:47:04,000 --> 00:47:06,250
Hmm. Maybe demons aren't
the most trustworthy creatures

918
00:47:06,333 --> 00:47:07,375

[both] Ugh!

00:48:11,166 --> 00:48:14,250

00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,000
than your parents.

Oh, you creepy old dude!

Forgive me, Father,
but you wouldn't even be here without Kat.

Remember your first demon, Helley?

971
00:49:27,416 --> 00:49:30,250
You were just 12 when we captured it.

972
00:49:30,333 --> 00:49:32,791
Yes, made me summon demons,

973
00:49:32,875 --> 00:49:35,916
just so you could add them
to your stupid collection.

974
00:49:36,458 --> 00:49:41,416
I made you my right foot of justice,
and you quit on me!

975
00:49:41,500 --> 00:49:43,500
It had nothing to do with justice!

976
00:49:43,583 --> 00:49:45,041
It was entrapment.

977
00:49:45,916 --> 00:49:46,791
It was wrong.

There's a new Hell Maiden
at RBC, isn't there?

She's… She's safe!

982
00:50:03,291 --> 00:50:06,166
My bear would've told me she'd arrived,

983
00:50:06,250 --> 00:50:09,041
given me time to train and protect her.

984
00:50:09,125 --> 00:50:11,500
But you stole it from me.

985

has stolen it from you.

They're demons!

It couldn't have been.

1023
00:52:50,333 --> 00:52:52,000
We drowned him right here.

Gonna pop your clogs permanently!

Wait! I-I-I can get you the votes!

1034
00:53:15,041 --> 00:53:16,791
- Ah!
- For our new prison?

1035
00:53:17,375 --> 00:53:18,708
- How?
- [sighs]

1036

[mellow cheerful music playing]

1040
00:53:27,041 --> 00:53:29,208
{\an8}Um, we raised Padre, here.

1041
00:53:29,291 --> 00:53:30,166
From the dead.

1042
00:53:30,750 --> 00:53:35,083
Now, they can raise
the old-guard members you need.

1043
00:53:35,750 --> 00:53:37,708
The ones rotting in the cemetery?

1044
00:53:37,791 --> 00:53:40,333
Sure! Have 'em all cleaned up,
ready to vote by morning.

1045
00:53:40,916 --> 00:53:43,541
- [both laughing]
- Yes!

1046
00:53:43,625 --> 00:53:45,166
Get those prison votes,

1047
00:53:45,250 --> 00:53:47,833
{\an8}and we'll make you rich.

1048
00:53:47,916 --> 00:53:50,708
{\an8}Rich enough to build our Dream Faire?

1049
00:53:50,791 --> 00:53:51,708
Certainly!

1050
00:53:51,791 --> 00:53:54,250
We'll pull the permits,
fast-track construction...

1051
00:53:54,333 --> 00:53:55,500
And Bob's your uncle!

1052
00:53:56,333 --> 00:53:59,000
[clears throat] What about my school?

1053
00:53:59,083 --> 00:54:00,500
Of course, Father.

1054
00:54:00,583 --> 00:54:04,250
RBC shall have
our full financial support now!

1055
00:54:06,416 --> 00:54:07,625
Mmm.

1056
00:54:08,583 --> 00:54:12,333
Those brewery workers are
in the same cemetery.

1057
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:14,291
Gah!
