1
00:00:28,376 --> 00:00:31,683
And earthquake and a hurricane

2
00:00:31,814 --> 00:00:34,686
may have delayed this day.

3
00:00:34,817 --> 00:00:38,777
But this is a day that
would not be denied.

4
00:00:38,908 --> 00:00:44,348
For this day, we celebrate Dr.
Martin Luther King Jr's return

5
00:00:44,479 --> 00:00:45,915
to the National Mall.

6
00:00:46,046 --> 00:00:48,265
I never thought
I'd live to see this day.

7
00:00:51,268 --> 00:00:56,578
A monument to Martin
Luther King dedicated

8
00:00:56,708 --> 00:01:02,801
by our first African-American
President on the National Mall.

9
00:01:02,932 --> 00:01:04,890
It was a long struggle.

10
00:01:05,021 --> 00:01:07,502
But America, all
of us, together, we

11
00:01:07,632 --> 00:01:11,636
got there because of Martin
and so many others like him.

12
00:01:11,767 --> 00:01:15,597
I remember dear brother Malcolm,
how the corners of his mouth

13
00:01:15,727 --> 00:01:18,774
turned up when his smile
and his devilish laugh.

14
00:01:18,904 --> 00:01:20,297
You know?

15
00:01:20,428 --> 00:01:25,433
And then there were their wives.

16
00:01:25,563 --> 00:01:27,478
They carried on
in their struggle

17
00:01:27,609 --> 00:01:29,654
even after their
men were... were...

18
00:01:29,785 --> 00:01:31,613
Were... were gunned
down in cold blood.

19
00:01:31,743 --> 00:01:34,659
I mean, they were a sisterhood,
born of sorrow, yes.

20
00:01:34,790 --> 00:01:39,316
But it became a
sisterhood of greatness.

21
00:01:39,447 --> 00:01:42,189
It's Betty and Coretta
I remember the most.

22
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:45,583
When Martin was jailed during
the fight for voting rights,

23
00:01:45,714 --> 00:01:49,805
Coretta rushed down to Selma,
Alabama to be by his side.

24
00:01:49,935 --> 00:01:52,416
It was there that
she met Malcolm

25
00:01:52,547 --> 00:01:54,723
for the first and only time.

26
00:01:54,853 --> 00:01:56,203
Then we'll take it off.

27
00:01:56,333 --> 00:01:57,333
Yeah.

28
00:02:02,861 --> 00:02:04,709
I'd like to think the
folks in this part of the world

29
00:02:04,733 --> 00:02:06,735
would do well to listen
to Dr. Martin Luther King,

30
00:02:06,865 --> 00:02:10,652
and give him what he is asking
for, before some other faction

31
00:02:10,782 --> 00:02:13,872
comes along and takes
it some other way.

32
00:02:14,003 --> 00:02:15,265
What he wants is the balance.

33
00:02:15,396 --> 00:02:16,701
And it is a right.

34
00:02:16,832 --> 00:02:19,791
And it will be gotten
one way or the other.

35
00:02:22,881 --> 00:02:28,235
Now I believe in nonviolence if
a person is nonviolent with me.

36
00:02:28,365 --> 00:02:31,107
But if my enemy does not
believe in nonviolence,

37
00:02:31,238 --> 00:02:33,892
then practicing nonviolence
then, in my opinion,

38
00:02:34,023 --> 00:02:35,981
is a waste of time.

39
00:02:36,112 --> 00:02:38,158
If the sick that dog
on you, you shoot it.

40
00:02:38,288 --> 00:02:39,637
Understand me?

41
00:03:00,702 --> 00:03:02,486
Mrs. King.

42
00:03:02,617 --> 00:03:04,227
Malik.

43
00:03:04,358 --> 00:03:07,012
I know you by the name Malcolm.

44
00:03:07,143 --> 00:03:09,276
Well, you didn't
know I changed it then.

45
00:03:09,406 --> 00:03:10,905
I guess they called you
down here to the church

46
00:03:10,929 --> 00:03:12,409
when they heard I
was coming, huh?

47
00:03:12,540 --> 00:03:15,020
You know it's irresponsible
to talk the way you do.

48
00:03:15,151 --> 00:03:17,762
We got enough problems down
here without you showing up

49
00:03:17,893 --> 00:03:18,937
and bringing us more.

50
00:03:19,068 --> 00:03:20,219
I didn't come here
to make trouble.

51
00:03:20,243 --> 00:03:21,810
I'm here to support Dr. King.

52
00:03:21,940 --> 00:03:22,811
You should thank me.

53
00:03:22,941 --> 00:03:24,291
And so should he.

54
00:03:24,421 --> 00:03:26,094
If his enemies wind have
given him what he wants,

55
00:03:26,118 --> 00:03:27,792
it's only because I
scared the pants off them.

56
00:03:27,816 --> 00:03:30,340
And if we wind up fighting
amongst ourselves over strategy

57
00:03:30,471 --> 00:03:33,256
and lose sight of the bigger
picture, who do we thank then?

58
00:03:33,387 --> 00:03:34,387
I agree.

59
00:03:34,431 --> 00:03:36,303
We need to be self empowered.

60
00:03:36,433 --> 00:03:39,697
We need a strong sense of pride
in ourselves and our history.

61
00:03:39,828 --> 00:03:42,483
That's why I'm asking Dr.
King to link up his struggle

62
00:03:42,613 --> 00:03:44,939
with that about black and brown
brothers and sisters in Africa

63
00:03:44,963 --> 00:03:46,661
and the rest of the world.

64
00:03:46,791 --> 00:03:48,116
Well, shouldn't we deal with
our own fires in this country

65
00:03:48,140 --> 00:03:49,420
before we go putting out others?

66
00:03:49,533 --> 00:03:50,273
You're missing the point.

67
00:03:50,404 --> 00:03:51,840
Oh, am I?

68
00:03:51,970 --> 00:03:54,799
We get those countries to
censor ours in the United

69
00:03:54,930 --> 00:03:58,107
Nations and you'll see some
real change down here real fast.

70
00:03:58,238 --> 00:04:00,979
We push for that, we
risk bringing down Johnson.

71
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:05,419
And no other President
has done more for us.

72
00:04:05,549 --> 00:04:08,465
If he's that great, why is
your husband in jail right now?

73
00:04:12,513 --> 00:04:15,777
My husband has faith,
as do I, that right

74
00:04:15,907 --> 00:04:17,518
will triumph in men's hearts.

75
00:04:20,172 --> 00:04:21,826
Well, someone has faith.

76
00:04:21,957 --> 00:04:22,957
That's for sure.

77
00:04:25,352 --> 00:04:27,484
I'm glad I met you, Mrs. King.

78
00:04:27,615 --> 00:04:30,095
I can see where Dr.
King gets his strength.

79
00:04:33,882 --> 00:04:34,882
Minister.

80
00:04:39,540 --> 00:04:41,063
I was rude of earlier.

81
00:04:48,505 --> 00:04:50,290
Thank you for coming.

82
00:05:22,844 --> 00:05:24,367
How are you holding on?

83
00:05:24,498 --> 00:05:27,588
I hate it here.

84
00:05:27,718 --> 00:05:30,025
Oh, I know.

85
00:05:30,155 --> 00:05:33,594
Never gets any easier, does it?

86
00:05:33,724 --> 00:05:35,465
How are the children?

87
00:05:35,596 --> 00:05:36,423
Worried.

88
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:38,642
They wanted to come down.

89
00:05:38,773 --> 00:05:41,863
Edith's with them.

90
00:05:41,993 --> 00:05:44,996
You should see the
support you're getting.

91
00:05:45,127 --> 00:05:49,044
All the news stations
are down here.

92
00:05:49,174 --> 00:05:50,741
Backers are in town.

93
00:05:50,872 --> 00:05:53,004
Even Malcolm X came.

94
00:05:53,135 --> 00:05:56,225
To glorify himself, no doubt.

95
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:59,707
That man gives the
struggle a bad name.

96
00:05:59,837 --> 00:06:00,708
I don't know.

97
00:06:00,838 --> 00:06:03,058
He's seemed different in person.

98
00:06:03,188 --> 00:06:05,060
Even changed his name.

99
00:06:05,190 --> 00:06:09,194
He refuses to disavow violence.

100
00:06:09,325 --> 00:06:13,111
We need the White man to make
any progress in this country.

101
00:06:13,242 --> 00:06:16,201
And threatening him with
violence is not the answer.

102
00:06:18,769 --> 00:06:20,292
I think he's softening.

103
00:06:22,991 --> 00:06:26,124
In his heart, he
wants what we want.

104
00:06:26,255 --> 00:06:31,956
I think it's possible that he
could come around given time.

105
00:06:35,090 --> 00:06:41,052
I sure hope you're
right, for all of our sake.

106
00:06:47,494 --> 00:06:49,800
Go to sleep, sweetie.

107
00:06:49,931 --> 00:06:51,106
Close your eyes.

108
00:06:54,370 --> 00:06:55,893
Go to sleep.

109
00:07:09,646 --> 00:07:11,996
What you doing up still?

110
00:07:12,127 --> 00:07:12,780
Time to get you to bed.

111
00:07:12,910 --> 00:07:14,912
Go on now.

112
00:07:15,043 --> 00:07:16,740
Tom, won't you head home?

113
00:07:16,871 --> 00:07:19,003
Malcolm told me to
stay and watch you all.

114
00:07:19,134 --> 00:07:20,788
Nothing's going
to happen tonight.

115
00:07:20,918 --> 00:07:22,137
Now go on.

116
00:07:22,267 --> 00:07:23,636
Sister Antoinette's
going want you home.

117
00:07:23,660 --> 00:07:24,792
I'll see you in the morning.

118
00:07:41,722 --> 00:07:44,246
Two such beautiful girls.

119
00:07:44,376 --> 00:07:46,117
Now get straight to sleep, OK?

120
00:07:49,512 --> 00:07:52,297
Stay in bed.

121
00:08:06,834 --> 00:08:07,965
Oh, Malcolm.

122
00:08:08,096 --> 00:08:09,619
You scared me.

123
00:08:09,750 --> 00:08:11,969
I parked a couple of
blocks away just to be safe.

124
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:12,840
Daddy.

125
00:08:12,970 --> 00:08:13,754
Daddy.

126
00:08:13,884 --> 00:08:14,537
Attallah.

127
00:08:14,668 --> 00:08:15,973
Daddy.

128
00:08:16,104 --> 00:08:17,105
Qubilah, come over here.

129
00:08:17,235 --> 00:08:18,062
Daddy.

130
00:08:18,193 --> 00:08:18,802
No time to be sleeping.

131
00:08:18,933 --> 00:08:20,456
Daddy's home.

132
00:08:20,587 --> 00:08:21,239
I missed you both.

133
00:08:21,370 --> 00:08:22,023
You miss me?

134
00:08:22,153 --> 00:08:23,807
Yes.

135
00:08:23,938 --> 00:08:25,524
I just put them to bed and
you riling them all up again.

136
00:08:25,548 --> 00:08:26,549
Oh, come on.

137
00:08:26,680 --> 00:08:27,724
Who wants some ice cream?

138
00:08:27,855 --> 00:08:28,986
- I do.
- I do.

139
00:08:29,117 --> 00:08:30,117
Yeah, let's go.

140
00:08:33,774 --> 00:08:35,166
I got something for you girls.

141
00:08:39,562 --> 00:08:41,172
Wow.

142
00:08:41,303 --> 00:08:42,130
What is it?

143
00:08:42,260 --> 00:08:43,479
It's Big Ben.

144
00:08:43,610 --> 00:08:45,263
It's a giant clock in England.

145
00:08:45,394 --> 00:08:46,569
It's for your sisters too.

146
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:50,921
And this here is
England's national anthem.

147
00:08:51,052 --> 00:08:53,620
That's where I got
this, London, England.

148
00:08:53,750 --> 00:08:55,752
It's where I got to
see the real Big Ben.

149
00:09:04,152 --> 00:09:06,589
Did you visit the
queen in her castle?

150
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,199
No.

151
00:09:08,330 --> 00:09:10,410
Daddy didn't get the meat
this time, he was too busy.

152
00:09:10,506 --> 00:09:12,856
But one day.

153
00:09:12,987 --> 00:09:15,467
Now, go to bed.

154
00:09:15,598 --> 00:09:16,598
I love you.

155
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:26,106
You know they wouldn't
let me into Paris.

156
00:09:26,130 --> 00:09:27,654
Made me turn back to London.

157
00:09:27,784 --> 00:09:30,570
I'm sure the FBI had their
fingers all over that.

158
00:09:30,700 --> 00:09:31,788
Stay home.

159
00:09:31,919 --> 00:09:33,137
Stop all this traveling.

160
00:09:33,268 --> 00:09:34,268
The girls need you here.

161
00:09:34,356 --> 00:09:35,139
I need you.

162
00:09:35,270 --> 00:09:36,880
I can't.

163
00:09:37,011 --> 00:09:38,597
If I'm going to introduce
that new resolution at the UN

164
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:40,971
sanctioning this country, I
need to find other nations

165
00:09:41,102 --> 00:09:43,234
willing to stand up
against dollarism.

166
00:09:43,365 --> 00:09:44,801
It's not easy.

167
00:09:44,932 --> 00:09:47,021
Once they drop those dollars
on you, your soul goes.

168
00:09:47,151 --> 00:09:48,718
I don't care about any of that.

169
00:09:48,849 --> 00:09:51,001
We got one month in his house
before the courts take it

170
00:09:51,025 --> 00:09:51,765
from us.

171
00:09:51,895 --> 00:09:53,114
And then what?

172
00:09:53,244 --> 00:09:55,159
This is all the girls
have ever known.

173
00:09:55,290 --> 00:09:56,378
Where we going to go?

174
00:09:56,508 --> 00:09:57,248
We got no money.

175
00:09:57,379 --> 00:09:59,033
We got nothing.

176
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:03,080
Elijah Muhammad gave us this
house and I plan to keep it.

177
00:10:03,211 --> 00:10:04,429
He didn't give us this house.

178
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:06,040
It's his house.

179
00:10:06,170 --> 00:10:07,974
He only let us live here
because you were preaching

180
00:10:07,998 --> 00:10:09,609
for the nation.

181
00:10:09,739 --> 00:10:10,934
And when he kicked you out,
he kicked you out of his house

182
00:10:10,958 --> 00:10:12,263
too.

183
00:10:12,394 --> 00:10:13,830
What you expect?

184
00:10:13,961 --> 00:10:15,678
You put the man down in
public every chance you get.

185
00:10:15,702 --> 00:10:17,878
I'll stop putting
him down when he apologizes

186
00:10:18,008 --> 00:10:19,899
to the young mothers of all
those children he had out

187
00:10:19,923 --> 00:10:21,359
of wedlock.

188
00:10:21,490 --> 00:10:22,989
He should get down on his
knees and beg forgiveness

189
00:10:23,013 --> 00:10:24,319
for seducing them.

190
00:10:24,449 --> 00:10:26,234
Malcolm, his men are
calling him every day

191
00:10:26,364 --> 00:10:28,062
threatening to kill you.

192
00:10:28,192 --> 00:10:29,909
Anything happens to me, my new
organization of Muslim brothers

193
00:10:29,933 --> 00:10:31,258
will take care of
you and our family.

194
00:10:31,282 --> 00:10:32,738
Your new organization
of Muslim brothers

195
00:10:32,762 --> 00:10:35,417
can barely afford to
keep their offices open.

196
00:10:35,547 --> 00:10:37,724
I'm supposed to rely on them?

197
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:38,899
Malcolm, I need a job.

198
00:10:39,029 --> 00:10:40,378
No.

199
00:10:40,509 --> 00:10:43,904
The woman's place is in
the home with the kids.

200
00:10:44,034 --> 00:10:46,515
Well, we need somewhere
safe to raise our kids.

201
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,996
You'll get it soon enough.

202
00:10:49,126 --> 00:10:51,302
After I'm gone.

203
00:10:51,433 --> 00:10:52,845
- Don't talk like that.
- Well, why not?

204
00:10:52,869 --> 00:10:53,609
I'm practically a dead man.

205
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,523
I don't want to hear it.

206
00:10:54,654 --> 00:10:55,654
I don't want to hear it.

207
00:10:55,742 --> 00:10:56,742
You know what it's true.

208
00:10:56,786 --> 00:10:58,832
They're going to kill me, Betty.

209
00:10:58,962 --> 00:11:00,762
Hell, I'd kill me too
after some of the things

210
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:02,444
I said about Elijah
and the nation.

211
00:11:08,276 --> 00:11:11,540
What are we supposed
to do without you?

212
00:11:11,671 --> 00:11:14,935
We've already been through this.

213
00:11:15,065 --> 00:11:17,154
There's a destiny for all of us.

214
00:11:17,285 --> 00:11:18,678
Nothing can keep us from it.

215
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:30,037
Anyway, as long as I'm here,
I'm going to enjoy my ice cream.

216
00:12:03,897 --> 00:12:07,814
My sweet brown sugar, I
wish I had more to give you.

217
00:12:14,472 --> 00:12:15,822
So what do you think?

218
00:12:15,952 --> 00:12:17,475
A boy?

219
00:12:17,606 --> 00:12:19,477
Fifth time's a charm?

220
00:12:19,608 --> 00:12:20,914
I don't know.

221
00:12:21,044 --> 00:12:25,005
But if it is, he's
waiting to see his daddy.

222
00:12:25,135 --> 00:12:26,876
And you better be there for him.

223
00:12:30,575 --> 00:12:31,272
What you trying to do?

224
00:12:31,402 --> 00:12:32,839
Make more babies.

225
00:12:32,969 --> 00:12:34,101
As many as possible.

226
00:12:43,066 --> 00:12:46,548
Before going to London, I
traveled down to see Dr. King.

227
00:12:46,678 --> 00:12:47,830
They wouldn't let
me in the prison,

228
00:12:47,854 --> 00:12:49,812
but I did get to see Mrs. King.

229
00:12:49,943 --> 00:12:50,943
Really?

230
00:12:50,987 --> 00:12:54,382
Yeah, she's a strong sister.

231
00:12:54,512 --> 00:12:55,818
Not as strong as you though.

232
00:12:57,777 --> 00:12:59,256
I went to Tuskegee too.

233
00:12:59,387 --> 00:13:02,390
Your old alma mater
invited me to speak.

234
00:13:02,520 --> 00:13:03,826
I got scared of him.

235
00:13:03,957 --> 00:13:04,957
I bet you did.

236
00:13:07,961 --> 00:13:10,528
Oh, Tuskegee.

237
00:13:10,659 --> 00:13:13,357
I remember back in Detroit
when my mama put me on a train

238
00:13:13,488 --> 00:13:15,098
and go down there.

239
00:13:15,229 --> 00:13:19,711
I was just 17 and on my way
to college for the first time.

240
00:13:19,842 --> 00:13:23,411
And I was so sheltered
up until then.

241
00:13:23,541 --> 00:13:25,108
We were on a station platform.

242
00:13:25,239 --> 00:13:28,677
And there she was, this woman
who loved me all my life

243
00:13:28,808 --> 00:13:32,507
struggling to tell me what
I find when I got there.

244
00:13:32,637 --> 00:13:35,031
Honest White folks
showing their true racism.

245
00:13:35,162 --> 00:13:36,685
Yeah.

246
00:13:36,816 --> 00:13:38,750
Yeah, it was the first time
I ever seen her at a loss

247
00:13:38,774 --> 00:13:40,210
for words.

248
00:13:40,341 --> 00:13:42,082
I didn't understand
until I got there.

249
00:13:45,172 --> 00:13:47,348
You know, I couldn't believe
the people I didn't even

250
00:13:47,478 --> 00:13:48,566
know could hate me so much.

251
00:13:48,697 --> 00:13:49,697
Mm-hmm.

252
00:13:52,744 --> 00:13:54,746
I didn't know how to
react until I met you.

253
00:14:04,234 --> 00:14:09,196
I'm sorry for everything.

254
00:14:27,649 --> 00:14:28,476
Go.
Go.

255
00:14:28,606 --> 00:14:29,606
Go.

256
00:14:33,568 --> 00:14:35,135
Hit 'em now.

257
00:14:41,489 --> 00:14:44,884
Mommy.

258
00:14:45,014 --> 00:14:45,841
Daddy.

259
00:14:45,972 --> 00:14:46,798
Mommy.

260
00:14:46,929 --> 00:14:47,929
What is it?

261
00:14:52,369 --> 00:14:54,110
Get up.

262
00:14:54,241 --> 00:14:56,112
Get up!

263
00:15:00,682 --> 00:15:01,770
Get the babies.

264
00:15:12,781 --> 00:15:13,651
Come on.
Come on.

265
00:15:13,782 --> 00:15:14,652
Come on.
Come on.

266
00:15:14,783 --> 00:15:15,783
Stay with me.

267
00:15:18,743 --> 00:15:19,440
Go with your mom.

268
00:15:19,570 --> 00:15:20,397
Go with your mom.

269
00:15:20,528 --> 00:15:21,528
Come on.

270
00:15:33,454 --> 00:15:34,759
Come here.

271
00:15:34,890 --> 00:15:35,760
Come here.

272
00:15:35,891 --> 00:15:36,936
Come here.

273
00:15:56,781 --> 00:15:57,826
Hey, girls.

274
00:15:57,957 --> 00:15:59,045
Oh.

275
00:15:59,175 --> 00:16:00,916
Come on, I got to talk to you.

276
00:16:01,047 --> 00:16:02,613
I've arranged for
Tom to take you

277
00:16:02,744 --> 00:16:04,591
and the kids back to stay with
him and sister Antoinette.

278
00:16:04,615 --> 00:16:05,355
What?

279
00:16:05,486 --> 00:16:06,486
What about you?

280
00:16:06,530 --> 00:16:07,551
I've got to go to the airport.

281
00:16:07,575 --> 00:16:08,402
I've got a speech in Detroit.

282
00:16:08,532 --> 00:16:09,620
Today?

283
00:16:09,751 --> 00:16:10,771
I'm not going to be scared away.

284
00:16:10,795 --> 00:16:12,014
Malcolm, the kids need you.

285
00:16:12,145 --> 00:16:13,146
They are terrified.

286
00:16:13,276 --> 00:16:14,471
They don't know
what's happening.

287
00:16:14,495 --> 00:16:15,844
It's too dangerous here.

288
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,978
It's worse for them if
I stay here with you.

289
00:16:19,108 --> 00:16:21,806
Things are going to change soon.

290
00:16:21,937 --> 00:16:25,114
We'll get a new
house, someplace safe.

291
00:16:25,245 --> 00:16:28,161
Just think about the future.

292
00:16:28,291 --> 00:16:30,380
That's where our hope lies.

293
00:16:42,479 --> 00:16:44,829
With what they
could salvage from the fire,

294
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:49,269
Betty and the kids moved in with
Tom and his wife Antoinette.

295
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:51,010
We called her Tony.

296
00:16:51,140 --> 00:16:52,968
A week went by.

297
00:16:53,099 --> 00:16:55,840
They were getting threatening
calls day and night.

298
00:16:55,971 --> 00:16:58,495
And still, they always
answered the phone

299
00:16:58,626 --> 00:17:01,324
hoping it would be
Malcolm on the line.

300
00:17:04,545 --> 00:17:05,850
- Hello?
- Hey, Tony.

301
00:17:05,981 --> 00:17:06,981
It's Malcolm.

302
00:17:07,069 --> 00:17:07,765
Can I speak to Betty, please?

303
00:17:07,896 --> 00:17:09,376
Just a minute.

304
00:17:19,429 --> 00:17:21,083
Malcolm.

305
00:17:21,214 --> 00:17:22,998
Hey, how are you doing?

306
00:17:23,129 --> 00:17:24,652
How are the girls?

307
00:17:24,782 --> 00:17:26,436
Missing you.

308
00:17:26,567 --> 00:17:28,873
Me too.

309
00:17:29,004 --> 00:17:30,527
Some good news.

310
00:17:30,658 --> 00:17:32,810
I spoke to my sister Ella
about helping with the house.

311
00:17:32,834 --> 00:17:34,377
She said that she'd
paid the down payment

312
00:17:34,401 --> 00:17:35,943
and put it in her name
since no one to sell to me.

313
00:17:35,967 --> 00:17:37,317
Oh, that's great, honey.

314
00:17:37,447 --> 00:17:38,448
Whatever it takes.

315
00:17:38,579 --> 00:17:39,710
Whatever it takes.

316
00:17:39,841 --> 00:17:44,541
I just want us to
be together again.

317
00:17:47,022 --> 00:17:48,415
What is it?

318
00:17:48,545 --> 00:17:50,243
What is it?

319
00:17:50,373 --> 00:17:51,679
Some coward called this morning

320
00:17:51,809 --> 00:17:53,376
and said, wake up, brother.

321
00:17:53,507 --> 00:17:56,336
Sounded like a White man trying
to put fear into my heart

322
00:17:56,466 --> 00:17:58,425
and into the hearts of
everyone who follows me.

323
00:17:58,555 --> 00:18:01,471
I can't let them do that.

324
00:18:01,602 --> 00:18:03,232
I have to leave now to
preach up in Harlem.

325
00:18:03,256 --> 00:18:04,909
Would it bother you
to bring the girls?

326
00:18:05,040 --> 00:18:06,085
Of course not.

327
00:18:08,783 --> 00:18:10,872
I love you, Betty.

328
00:18:11,002 --> 00:18:13,527
I... I love you too.

329
00:18:23,754 --> 00:18:25,365
He wants us to come
to the Autobahn.

330
00:18:25,495 --> 00:18:27,715
Oh, sister Betty,
that's wonderful.

331
00:18:27,845 --> 00:18:28,542
Tom.

332
00:18:28,672 --> 00:18:30,065
I heard.

333
00:18:30,196 --> 00:18:31,719
I'll drive you there.

334
00:18:31,849 --> 00:18:33,547
We better get a move
on or you'll be late.

335
00:18:33,677 --> 00:18:35,636
Oh, thank you so much.

336
00:18:35,766 --> 00:18:36,766
You go on.

337
00:18:36,854 --> 00:18:37,875
I'll take care of the baby.

338
00:18:37,899 --> 00:18:38,508
Thank you, sister Antoinette.

339
00:18:38,639 --> 00:18:39,727
Thank you.

340
00:19:00,269 --> 00:19:01,836
I come to these
things all the time.

341
00:19:01,966 --> 00:19:03,011
All the time.

342
00:19:08,669 --> 00:19:10,540
Assalamu alaikum,
brothers and sisters.

343
00:19:11,715 --> 00:19:13,630
Get your hand of my pocket.

344
00:19:22,770 --> 00:19:23,858
Hold it.
Hold it.

345
00:19:23,988 --> 00:19:24,859
Don't get excited.

346
00:19:24,989 --> 00:19:26,295
Let's stay cool, brothers.

347
00:19:26,426 --> 00:19:27,862
Everything is going
to be all right.

348
00:20:34,929 --> 00:20:36,670
I was afraid something like this

349
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,193
would happen.

350
00:20:38,324 --> 00:20:42,545
Nothing good can ever come
from preaching violence.

351
00:20:42,676 --> 00:20:45,069
That is such a loss.

352
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,115
They say his wife's pregnant.

353
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:49,335
Oh, the poor woman.

354
00:20:52,381 --> 00:20:56,646
Martin, we have to
reach out to her.

355
00:20:56,777 --> 00:21:00,737
I've already made a
statement to the press.

356
00:21:00,868 --> 00:21:01,956
Something more personal.

357
00:21:06,439 --> 00:21:07,788
Hate leads to
more and more hate.

358
00:21:07,918 --> 00:21:10,181
Those are Malcolm
supporters burning down

359
00:21:10,312 --> 00:21:11,661
the nation's mosque.

360
00:21:11,792 --> 00:21:13,010
Today in Harlem.

361
00:21:13,141 --> 00:21:14,708
The burning of a
Nation a Islam mosques.

362
00:21:14,838 --> 00:21:16,468
Serves them right for
what the Nation done to him.

363
00:21:16,492 --> 00:21:18,581
Dark and twisted Malcolm X,

364
00:21:18,712 --> 00:21:22,498
who used his extraordinary
genius for evil intent.

365
00:21:22,629 --> 00:21:25,022
Nation of Islam spokesperson
Louis Farrakhan was...

366
00:21:25,153 --> 00:21:27,547
Their religion wasn't nothing
but four senior citizens

367
00:21:27,677 --> 00:21:29,157
and a beat up,
old station wagon.

368
00:21:29,288 --> 00:21:30,637
Now look at all of them.

369
00:21:30,767 --> 00:21:32,769
Malcolm didn't know
what he was playing with.

370
00:21:32,900 --> 00:21:34,118
No, he didn't.

371
00:21:34,249 --> 00:21:36,077
He didn't know what
he was playing with.

372
00:21:36,207 --> 00:21:38,688
You just don't jump up against
a divine messenger of God

373
00:21:38,819 --> 00:21:39,472
like he did.

374
00:21:39,602 --> 00:21:40,908
He has to die.

375
00:21:41,038 --> 00:21:42,431
And God obliged to it.

376
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:45,565
Talk like that's what
brother Malcolm killed.

377
00:21:45,695 --> 00:21:47,784
Minister Farrakhan's trying
to take his own position

378
00:21:47,915 --> 00:21:49,482
in the Nation.

379
00:21:49,612 --> 00:21:51,875
He got them all riled up and
now look what's happened.

380
00:21:52,006 --> 00:21:53,573
I can't stand to see it.

381
00:21:53,703 --> 00:21:57,577
I just want to keep all
this away from my kids.

382
00:21:57,707 --> 00:21:59,753
They'll be able to see
how much their daddy meant

383
00:21:59,883 --> 00:22:01,363
to people at the funeral.

384
00:22:01,494 --> 00:22:02,756
They're not going.

385
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:03,886
What?

386
00:22:03,931 --> 00:22:05,889
They're not going.

387
00:22:06,020 --> 00:22:08,718
I couldn't protect them from
seeing their father killed.

388
00:22:08,849 --> 00:22:12,331
I couldn't protect them from
seeing their house burned down.

389
00:22:12,461 --> 00:22:14,202
I'm going to protect them now.

390
00:22:14,333 --> 00:22:15,595
Sister Betty.

391
00:22:15,725 --> 00:22:20,382
Keeping them safe,
that's what's important.

392
00:22:20,513 --> 00:22:22,253
That's more important
than anything.

393
00:22:27,346 --> 00:22:33,090
Here at this final
hour in this quiet place,

394
00:22:33,221 --> 00:22:38,313
Harlem has come to bid farewell
to one of its brightest hopes.

395
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:44,406
Extinguished now and
gone from us forever.

396
00:22:44,537 --> 00:22:49,759
Malcolm was our manhood,
our living Black manhood.

397
00:22:49,890 --> 00:22:55,069
And in honoring him, we
honor the best in ourselves.

398
00:22:55,199 --> 00:22:56,984
However, we may have...

399
00:23:32,889 --> 00:23:34,543
Just look at her, Tom.

400
00:23:34,674 --> 00:23:38,852
She's got no money, no
home and she's pregnant.

401
00:23:38,982 --> 00:23:40,201
What's going to happen to her?

402
00:23:56,130 --> 00:23:58,306
Sister Betty, I
brought you some tea.

403
00:23:58,437 --> 00:24:01,178
Oh, thank you, sister.

404
00:24:05,269 --> 00:24:07,228
The telegram came.

405
00:24:07,358 --> 00:24:10,536
It's from Martin Luther King Jr.

406
00:24:10,666 --> 00:24:11,666
Read it.

407
00:24:18,935 --> 00:24:21,547
I was certainly saddened
by the shocking and tragic

408
00:24:21,677 --> 00:24:23,810
assassination of your husband.

409
00:24:23,940 --> 00:24:28,075
While we did not always
see eye to eye on methods

410
00:24:28,205 --> 00:24:31,426
to solve the race
problem, I always

411
00:24:31,905 --> 00:24:34,298
had a deep affection
for Malcolm.

412
00:24:34,429 --> 00:24:35,865
He was an eloquent spokesman

413
00:24:35,996 --> 00:24:37,301
for his point of view.

414
00:24:37,432 --> 00:24:39,478
And no one can honestly
doubt that Malcolm

415
00:24:39,608 --> 00:24:41,175
had a great concern
for the problems

416
00:24:41,305 --> 00:24:43,351
that we face as a race.

417
00:24:43,482 --> 00:24:46,049
While I know that this is
a difficult hour for you...

418
00:24:46,180 --> 00:24:51,272
I am sure that God will give
you the strength to endure.

419
00:24:51,402 --> 00:24:56,146
I will certainly be
remembering you in my prayers.

420
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:59,410
And please know that
you have my deepest sympathy.

421
00:24:59,541 --> 00:25:01,456
Always considered me a friend.

422
00:25:01,587 --> 00:25:05,808
And if I can do anything to
ease the heavy load that you

423
00:25:05,939 --> 00:25:08,768
are forced to carry
at this time...

424
00:25:08,898 --> 00:25:11,901
Please feel free to call on me.

425
00:25:12,032 --> 00:25:16,950
Martin Luther King Jr.

426
00:25:20,823 --> 00:25:23,217
He should have values him
when he meant something.

427
00:25:29,876 --> 00:25:32,182
After Malcolm died
it felt like the whole nation

428
00:25:32,313 --> 00:25:33,532
was in a fever.

429
00:25:33,662 --> 00:25:36,230
Students protested
the war in Vietnam.

430
00:25:36,360 --> 00:25:40,364
Watts burned, then Detroit.

431
00:25:40,495 --> 00:25:42,889
The Black Panthers
preached revolution

432
00:25:43,019 --> 00:25:46,240
using Malcolm's early speeches
to justify their actions.

433
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,112
And Betty, well, she...
She... she had her hands full

434
00:25:49,243 --> 00:25:50,723
just raising six girls.

435
00:25:50,853 --> 00:25:51,941
That's right.

436
00:25:52,072 --> 00:25:53,639
The boy she and
Malcolm never came.

437
00:25:53,769 --> 00:25:56,946
Instead, they got twin girls.

438
00:25:57,077 --> 00:25:58,731
We all helped her.

439
00:25:58,861 --> 00:26:00,901
And with the royalties from
Malcolm's autobiography,

440
00:26:00,994 --> 00:26:04,519
we were able to raise enough to
please a down payment on a home

441
00:26:04,650 --> 00:26:05,738
in Mount Vernon.

442
00:26:05,868 --> 00:26:07,783
A nice home away
from the city where

443
00:26:07,914 --> 00:26:11,613
Barry could give her
children a sheltered life

444
00:26:11,744 --> 00:26:12,745
she had dreamed of.

445
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,140
Hello?

446
00:26:17,271 --> 00:26:18,751
In here.

447
00:26:18,881 --> 00:26:20,883
Trying to make some
clothes for the kids.

448
00:26:21,014 --> 00:26:23,233
Then I came just in time.

449
00:26:23,364 --> 00:26:25,279
Oh, they've gotten so big.

450
00:26:25,409 --> 00:26:26,628
What's all this?

451
00:26:26,759 --> 00:26:28,021
I took up a collection.

452
00:26:28,151 --> 00:26:30,414
Oh, bless you,
sister Antoinette.

453
00:26:30,545 --> 00:26:31,198
Look at you.

454
00:26:31,328 --> 00:26:32,852
Oh, look at you.

455
00:26:32,982 --> 00:26:34,070
You look good.

456
00:26:34,201 --> 00:26:34,941
Girl, please.

457
00:26:35,071 --> 00:26:36,290
I'm run ragged.

458
00:26:36,420 --> 00:26:38,901
I got diapers and
daycare up to here.

459
00:26:39,032 --> 00:26:41,295
I feel like the old
woman in the shoe.

460
00:26:43,689 --> 00:26:45,299
Oh, this will be
nice for Qubilah.

461
00:26:45,429 --> 00:26:46,648
Mm-hmm.

462
00:26:46,779 --> 00:26:48,737
Oh, this is pretty one.

463
00:26:48,868 --> 00:26:50,130
Yeah, I like that one too.

464
00:26:50,260 --> 00:26:52,088
Oh, I love these.

465
00:26:52,219 --> 00:26:54,569
So how you doing
up here in suburbia?

466
00:26:54,700 --> 00:26:55,788
It's all right.

467
00:26:55,918 --> 00:26:57,318
Except every time
a neighbor see us,

468
00:26:57,354 --> 00:27:00,314
they think we're going
to blow something up.

469
00:27:00,444 --> 00:27:03,143
Well, you're
lucky to be up here.

470
00:27:03,273 --> 00:27:06,102
In Harlem, there's
fighting every day.

471
00:27:06,233 --> 00:27:08,714
It's like Malcolm
said, the chickens

472
00:27:08,844 --> 00:27:11,673
are coming home to roost.

473
00:27:11,804 --> 00:27:13,283
He wouldn't like that.

474
00:27:13,414 --> 00:27:14,981
He preached self-defense.

475
00:27:15,111 --> 00:27:17,592
He was for peace and self
empowerment through knowledge.

476
00:27:17,723 --> 00:27:21,248
Violence was always
a last resort.

477
00:27:21,378 --> 00:27:22,945
You should get out there.

478
00:27:23,076 --> 00:27:25,034
Tell people who he really was.

479
00:27:25,165 --> 00:27:27,733
No, there's other
ways I can be a service.

480
00:27:27,863 --> 00:27:29,952
Volunteering, helping people.

481
00:27:30,083 --> 00:27:31,123
That's what I'm doing now.

482
00:27:37,046 --> 00:27:38,961
These are the startling
images from Memphis

483
00:27:39,092 --> 00:27:41,572
yesterday where civil rights
leader Martin Luther King

484
00:27:41,703 --> 00:27:44,663
Jr. had come to a rally was
striking sanitation workers

485
00:27:44,793 --> 00:27:46,708
for better wages.

486
00:27:46,839 --> 00:27:50,016
The so-called nonviolent
march quickly got out of hand.

487
00:27:50,146 --> 00:27:53,236
And King and his cohorts had
to flee for safety, leaving

488
00:27:53,367 --> 00:27:55,848
his power and influence within
the movement he created very

489
00:27:55,978 --> 00:27:56,978
much in doubt.

490
00:27:58,154 --> 00:28:00,069
President Johnson
offered federal...

491
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:01,810
Yes.

492
00:28:01,941 --> 00:28:03,943
Your husband's
a coward and a hypocrite.

493
00:28:04,073 --> 00:28:06,336
He's next.

494
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,555
Who are you?

495
00:28:07,686 --> 00:28:08,861
Why do you hate him so?

496
00:28:18,740 --> 00:28:20,873
Martin?

497
00:28:21,003 --> 00:28:22,003
Martin.

498
00:28:24,485 --> 00:28:28,054
They called again, didn't they?

499
00:28:28,184 --> 00:28:29,882
And they're calling me a coward.

500
00:28:35,017 --> 00:28:37,890
They're saying I'm responsible.

501
00:28:38,020 --> 00:28:40,675
And Martin Luther
King's non-violence

502
00:28:40,806 --> 00:28:43,373
is causing violence.

503
00:28:43,504 --> 00:28:45,158
They're wrong.

504
00:28:45,288 --> 00:28:48,683
You're the one trying to make
sense out of all this chaos.

505
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:53,209
Maybe I let it
all go to my head.

506
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:57,518
A Nobel Prize, the
march on Washington.

507
00:29:00,173 --> 00:29:02,044
I thought I changed the world.

508
00:29:02,175 --> 00:29:06,570
I look back and I don't feel
like I accomplished much.

509
00:29:06,701 --> 00:29:07,354
You have.

510
00:29:07,484 --> 00:29:09,225
Not fast enough.

511
00:29:09,356 --> 00:29:11,097
Not after what
happened in Memphis.

512
00:29:11,227 --> 00:29:14,535
There are folks that are
saying they don't even

513
00:29:14,665 --> 00:29:17,843
want me to come back.

514
00:29:17,973 --> 00:29:20,584
And maybe they're right not to.

515
00:29:20,715 --> 00:29:24,371
People want answers, Cori.

516
00:29:24,501 --> 00:29:28,418
And then I don't know
if I have them anymore.

517
00:29:28,549 --> 00:29:32,118
You always said this struggle
would take a long time.

518
00:29:32,248 --> 00:29:34,816
And that the way
wouldn't be easy.

519
00:29:34,947 --> 00:29:37,123
People need you, Martin.

520
00:29:37,253 --> 00:29:41,257
Never underestimate the
value of your leadership.

521
00:29:46,262 --> 00:29:50,527
What is the secret
of your faith in me?

522
00:29:50,658 --> 00:29:56,446
How is it that you believe in me
more than I believe in myself?

523
00:29:56,577 --> 00:29:59,493
Because you're a
vessel for greatness.

524
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,805
I've known it from
the instant we met.

525
00:30:20,949 --> 00:30:21,950
Thank you.

526
00:30:32,265 --> 00:30:34,093
Let's hurry and get inside.

527
00:30:34,223 --> 00:30:35,268
Oh.

528
00:30:35,398 --> 00:30:36,660
All right, don't let it get wet.

529
00:30:36,791 --> 00:30:38,351
Will Daddy be home
from Memphis by then?

530
00:30:38,401 --> 00:30:39,272
Why?

531
00:30:39,402 --> 00:30:40,447
I want him to see it too.

532
00:30:40,577 --> 00:30:42,144
Oh.

533
00:30:42,275 --> 00:30:44,712
Come Easter, your daddy will
be wherever he needs to be.

534
00:30:44,843 --> 00:30:46,018
Patience.

535
00:30:46,148 --> 00:30:46,888
Patience.

536
00:30:47,019 --> 00:30:48,019
I'm coming.

537
00:30:53,112 --> 00:30:54,330
Hello.

538
00:30:54,461 --> 00:30:55,288
Coretta, it's Jesse.

539
00:30:55,418 --> 00:30:56,985
Oh, Jesse.

540
00:30:57,116 --> 00:30:58,465
Oh, just one moment.

541
00:30:58,595 --> 00:31:00,684
Yoki, what did I say?

542
00:31:00,815 --> 00:31:04,297
I just want to say
it one more time.

543
00:31:04,427 --> 00:31:05,864
Jesse, so tell me.

544
00:31:05,994 --> 00:31:07,169
How's everything going?

545
00:31:07,300 --> 00:31:08,562
Doc, just got shot.

546
00:31:10,651 --> 00:31:11,651
Mamma?

547
00:31:14,089 --> 00:31:15,221
Go put that dress away.

548
00:31:20,487 --> 00:31:21,923
Coretta, you there?

549
00:31:22,054 --> 00:31:23,054
Coretta?

550
00:31:26,710 --> 00:31:29,670
Go on.

551
00:31:29,800 --> 00:31:31,237
It's bad, Cori.

552
00:31:31,367 --> 00:31:32,367
He's gone.

553
00:31:34,762 --> 00:31:42,762
Martin Luther King dedicated
his life to love and to justice

554
00:31:43,858 --> 00:31:46,774
between fellow human beings.

555
00:31:46,905 --> 00:31:51,126
He died from the
cause of that effort.

556
00:31:51,257 --> 00:31:54,608
In this difficult day,
in this difficult time

557
00:31:54,738 --> 00:31:55,609
for the United States...

558
00:31:55,739 --> 00:31:58,351
I was in my room.

559
00:31:58,481 --> 00:32:01,180
I heard the shot.

560
00:32:01,310 --> 00:32:04,705
By the time I got there,
he was already gone.

561
00:32:04,835 --> 00:32:08,578
He spoke so strongly
that night at Memphis.

562
00:32:10,624 --> 00:32:12,321
What an inspiration.

563
00:32:12,452 --> 00:32:17,196
He had a premonition and
he still didn't back down.

564
00:32:17,326 --> 00:32:20,721
We can make an effort
as Martin Luther King did

565
00:32:20,851 --> 00:32:24,986
to understand and to comprehend.

566
00:32:25,117 --> 00:32:27,357
Senator Kennedy's offered
a private plane to fly you down

567
00:32:27,423 --> 00:32:28,903
to get Martin.

568
00:32:29,034 --> 00:32:30,533
And Harry Belafonte called
and said he was on his way

569
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,733
to Atlanta.

570
00:32:32,863 --> 00:32:35,562
What's happening with
the march in Memphis?

571
00:32:35,692 --> 00:32:36,692
That's been canceled.

572
00:32:44,614 --> 00:32:47,008
We need to go ahead with it.

573
00:32:47,139 --> 00:32:48,662
They're rioting
across the country.

574
00:32:48,792 --> 00:32:50,664
We have to do something.

575
00:32:50,794 --> 00:32:54,015
We have to show that the
way to deal with Martin's

576
00:32:54,146 --> 00:32:56,975
assassination is
through nonviolence.

577
00:32:57,105 --> 00:32:59,368
We need to consecrate
his legacy.

578
00:32:59,499 --> 00:33:01,588
And what about
the death threats?

579
00:33:01,718 --> 00:33:03,242
Nothing's going to happen.

580
00:33:03,372 --> 00:33:04,372
How do you know that?

581
00:33:07,507 --> 00:33:10,423
Because I'll be
right by your side.

582
00:33:10,553 --> 00:33:11,685
And so will the children.

583
00:33:11,815 --> 00:33:13,252
It's what Martin
would have wanted.

584
00:33:18,909 --> 00:33:21,303
OK.

585
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:24,437
Just four days after
her husband's assassination,

586
00:33:24,567 --> 00:33:27,440
seeking to heal a wounded
and grieving nation,

587
00:33:27,570 --> 00:33:31,139
a dignified and composed Coretta
Scott King, widow of slain

588
00:33:31,270 --> 00:33:33,968
civil rights leader Martin
Luther King Jr, Together

589
00:33:34,099 --> 00:33:37,928
with three of her four children,
led a silent and peaceful march

590
00:33:38,059 --> 00:33:40,975
of over 21,000 through
downtown Memphis today.

591
00:33:41,106 --> 00:33:44,587
The very city where her husband
was so ruthlessly gunned down.

592
00:33:44,718 --> 00:33:47,677
Continuing his work, she
called for economic justice

593
00:33:47,808 --> 00:33:51,594
for the city's Black sanitation
workers and an end to racism.

594
00:34:03,519 --> 00:34:04,757
After Martin's
death, Coretta worked

595
00:34:04,781 --> 00:34:07,219
hard to keep his causes alive.

596
00:34:07,349 --> 00:34:09,264
She thought the
best way to do it

597
00:34:09,395 --> 00:34:14,356
was to get a national
holiday to honor him.

598
00:34:14,487 --> 00:34:15,879
Betty worked hard.

599
00:34:16,010 --> 00:34:18,012
She was always volunteering.

600
00:34:18,143 --> 00:34:18,969
Oh, I'm so sorry.

601
00:34:19,100 --> 00:34:20,362
Oh, sister Betty.

602
00:34:20,493 --> 00:34:22,277
When are you going to
learn to be on time?

603
00:34:22,408 --> 00:34:24,128
I was helping some of
my young sisters enrol

604
00:34:24,192 --> 00:34:25,498
they're kids in preschool.

605
00:34:25,628 --> 00:34:27,848
Then I just thought by
my councilman's office.

606
00:34:27,978 --> 00:34:29,023
Can you believe it?

607
00:34:29,154 --> 00:34:31,199
Another round of budget cuts.

608
00:34:31,330 --> 00:34:33,114
When the taxpayers
going to learn?

609
00:34:33,245 --> 00:34:36,813
Pay a little now or
a whole lot later.

610
00:34:36,944 --> 00:34:37,727
What?

611
00:34:37,858 --> 00:34:38,728
Is not funny.

612
00:34:38,859 --> 00:34:40,817
I wasn't laughing at you.

613
00:34:40,948 --> 00:34:42,388
I'm just wondering
what Malcolm would

614
00:34:42,515 --> 00:34:44,517
say if he saw you running
around like this with all

615
00:34:44,647 --> 00:34:46,127
these causes.

616
00:34:46,258 --> 00:34:48,390
He always wanted
you to stay at home.

617
00:34:48,521 --> 00:34:51,306
I do whatever I can
to help out the sisters.

618
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,962
Oh, there's a good spot.

619
00:34:55,093 --> 00:34:58,444
Listen, uh, you've heard about
this Black political convention

620
00:34:58,574 --> 00:35:00,141
in Gary, Indiana?

621
00:35:00,272 --> 00:35:01,272
Yes.

622
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:02,970
They asked me to speak at it.

623
00:35:03,101 --> 00:35:05,407
So you're going, right?

624
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,062
Oh, I don't think so.

625
00:35:08,193 --> 00:35:10,238
All those radicals.

626
00:35:10,369 --> 00:35:11,809
They twisted everything
Malcolm stood

627
00:35:11,892 --> 00:35:13,241
for to justify their actions.

628
00:35:13,372 --> 00:35:15,374
It's not just
radicals who are going.

629
00:35:15,504 --> 00:35:17,854
It's the whole Black community.

630
00:35:17,985 --> 00:35:19,421
It'll be a historic event.

631
00:35:19,552 --> 00:35:22,381
The first of its kind.

632
00:35:22,511 --> 00:35:25,471
If you don't go and speak up
for who Malcolm really was,

633
00:35:25,601 --> 00:35:27,777
those radical groups
will claim him.

634
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,998
And you'll lose
your man for good.

635
00:35:31,129 --> 00:35:33,566
This is your chance to
set the record straight.

636
00:35:37,222 --> 00:35:39,006
Coretta's going to
represent Martin.

637
00:35:49,843 --> 00:35:52,933
Mamma, do you really have to go?

638
00:35:53,063 --> 00:35:53,934
Don't worry, Qubilah.

639
00:35:54,064 --> 00:35:55,501
I'll be back in a few days.

640
00:35:55,631 --> 00:35:56,631
All right?

641
00:35:56,719 --> 00:35:58,678
Why do you have to leave it all?

642
00:35:58,808 --> 00:36:01,289
I have to go for daddy.

643
00:36:01,420 --> 00:36:05,206
Qubilah, honey,
mamma's going to be OK.

644
00:36:05,337 --> 00:36:07,643
You can trust me on that.

645
00:36:07,774 --> 00:36:08,557
All right?

646
00:36:08,688 --> 00:36:10,994
Give me a hug.

647
00:36:11,125 --> 00:36:12,692
I love you.

648
00:36:12,822 --> 00:36:13,822
I love you too.

649
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,090
See you later.

650
00:36:20,221 --> 00:36:25,966
The Black National Political
Convention was something else.

651
00:36:26,096 --> 00:36:28,664
Over 10,000 people showed up.

652
00:36:28,795 --> 00:36:30,318
It seemed like
everyone was there.

653
00:36:30,449 --> 00:36:33,234
Reverend Jackson, Amiri
Baraka, Shirley Chisholm, even

654
00:36:33,365 --> 00:36:34,757
Minister Farrakhan.

655
00:36:34,888 --> 00:36:37,847
I remember Betty had a place
of honor on stage right

656
00:36:37,978 --> 00:36:39,371
beside Coretta.

657
00:36:39,501 --> 00:36:40,763
It was the first time they met.

658
00:36:40,894 --> 00:36:43,201
Mrs.
Coretta Scott King.

659
00:36:54,255 --> 00:36:57,476
I'm glad to see you all here.

660
00:36:57,606 --> 00:37:01,610
And I know my husband would
have been glad as well.

661
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:09,923
As you know, we live
in a nation trouble

662
00:37:10,053 --> 00:37:17,060
with the triple evils of
racism, war and poverty.

663
00:37:17,191 --> 00:37:20,238
We need to address
these issues and we

664
00:37:20,368 --> 00:37:22,936
need to address them now.

665
00:37:25,808 --> 00:37:29,595
That's why I would like to say
a special word to the women

666
00:37:29,725 --> 00:37:30,725
in the audience.

667
00:37:35,253 --> 00:37:39,605
We are a powerful force.

668
00:37:42,390 --> 00:37:46,394
And our nation's
greatest untapped resource.

669
00:37:46,525 --> 00:37:53,401
Together, with men, we can
repair our injured society.

670
00:37:53,532 --> 00:37:58,276
With our faith and
our determination,

671
00:37:58,406 --> 00:38:03,890
we can build new hope,
establish new communities,

672
00:38:04,020 --> 00:38:10,549
construct new cities,
create a new nation.

673
00:38:13,116 --> 00:38:14,116
Yes!

674
00:38:19,122 --> 00:38:24,476
Yes, form a new
world, a just world.

675
00:38:24,606 --> 00:38:29,829
A world dedicated to families
and equality for all.

676
00:38:29,959 --> 00:38:33,180
A world of peace.

677
00:38:48,108 --> 00:38:50,328
And now, someone
who's making sure that we all

678
00:38:50,458 --> 00:38:54,201
can walk in survival when
we go with Malcom X. Let's

679
00:38:54,332 --> 00:38:56,421
welcome sister Betty Shabazz.

680
00:39:03,123 --> 00:39:04,123
Thank you.

681
00:39:06,605 --> 00:39:09,564
I think it's wonderful to see
so many Black face out there

682
00:39:09,695 --> 00:39:10,695
today.

683
00:39:21,924 --> 00:39:25,841
I know that for many of you,
my husband's words by any means

684
00:39:25,972 --> 00:39:31,151
necessary have become a rallying
cry for violent overthrow.

685
00:39:31,281 --> 00:39:34,110
But that's not who he was.

686
00:39:34,241 --> 00:39:38,463
During his pilgrimage to
Mecca, he met many people.

687
00:39:38,593 --> 00:39:40,421
And not just Black ones.

688
00:39:40,552 --> 00:39:44,338
People from all races,
all backgrounds,

689
00:39:44,469 --> 00:39:46,819
people who were kind to him.

690
00:39:46,949 --> 00:39:49,691
That was an education.

691
00:39:49,822 --> 00:39:53,739
He valued education and the
truth that came with it.

692
00:39:53,869 --> 00:39:58,613
I'm the truth, he once said,
no matter who tells it.

693
00:39:58,744 --> 00:40:04,140
I'm for justice, no matter
who it's for or against.

694
00:40:04,271 --> 00:40:07,056
I am human being
first and foremost.

695
00:40:07,187 --> 00:40:11,670
And as such, I am for whoever
and whatever benefits humanity

696
00:40:11,800 --> 00:40:13,411
as a whole.

697
00:40:13,541 --> 00:40:15,674
Now I know that's not
Malcolm some of you

698
00:40:15,804 --> 00:40:19,504
know or associate my
husband's memory with it.

699
00:40:19,634 --> 00:40:22,289
But that is who he was.

700
00:40:22,420 --> 00:40:26,641
And it's who we should
all aspire to be.

701
00:40:26,772 --> 00:40:27,773
Thank you.

702
00:40:43,832 --> 00:40:45,791
It was a beautiful speech.

703
00:40:45,921 --> 00:40:48,794
I'm sure a lot of people were
surprised to hear it coming

704
00:40:48,924 --> 00:40:50,491
from you.

705
00:40:50,622 --> 00:40:53,842
Well, it's not what they
thought about Malcolm.

706
00:40:53,973 --> 00:40:57,585
I suppose it's easy to
assume things about people.

707
00:40:57,716 --> 00:40:59,413
Yes.

708
00:40:59,544 --> 00:41:02,460
I been watching you on TV.

709
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:04,984
Admiring you.

710
00:41:05,114 --> 00:41:08,074
Envying you too.

711
00:41:08,204 --> 00:41:10,206
People love you
and your husband.

712
00:41:10,337 --> 00:41:14,167
You know, I met your husband
in Selma just before he died.

713
00:41:14,297 --> 00:41:15,951
He told me.

714
00:41:16,082 --> 00:41:17,866
He said you were
a strong sister.

715
00:41:17,997 --> 00:41:18,867
He said that?

716
00:41:18,998 --> 00:41:20,956
He made a point of it.

717
00:41:21,087 --> 00:41:23,002
Well, how about that?

718
00:41:23,132 --> 00:41:25,265
I half way suspected
when he complimented me,

719
00:41:25,395 --> 00:41:27,833
he was just trying to
curry favor with Martin.

720
00:41:27,963 --> 00:41:30,052
Oh, Malcolm curried
favor with no one.

721
00:41:32,925 --> 00:41:36,015
Your husband did
something important.

722
00:41:36,145 --> 00:41:39,540
He gave our people a
sense of power and pride.

723
00:41:39,671 --> 00:41:42,978
He showed us that Black could
be beautiful and strong.

724
00:41:43,109 --> 00:41:45,894
Less threatening
to a lot of people.

725
00:41:46,025 --> 00:41:49,419
I was surprised by how
his death affected me.

726
00:41:49,550 --> 00:41:53,598
For weeks, I walked around
with a pain in my chest

727
00:41:53,728 --> 00:41:58,254
and a sense of depression, as if
I had lost someone dear to me.

728
00:41:58,385 --> 00:42:01,214
I wish we had had the chance
to bring Martin and Malcolm

729
00:42:01,344 --> 00:42:02,824
together.

730
00:42:02,955 --> 00:42:04,802
They could have been a real
force for reconciliation

731
00:42:04,826 --> 00:42:05,827
and healing.

732
00:42:05,958 --> 00:42:09,178
Great things could
have happened.

733
00:42:09,309 --> 00:42:12,617
Betty, things are really
going to change now.

734
00:42:12,747 --> 00:42:14,836
You should be a part of it.

735
00:42:14,967 --> 00:42:16,795
I got six kids to raise
and nothing to offer.

736
00:42:16,925 --> 00:42:18,579
But that's not true.

737
00:42:18,710 --> 00:42:20,233
You're a strong woman.

738
00:42:20,363 --> 00:42:21,408
You must know that?

739
00:42:27,632 --> 00:42:31,244
I'm so glad we had this
chance to talk together.

740
00:42:31,374 --> 00:42:33,376
I hope we can stay in touch.

741
00:42:33,507 --> 00:42:36,336
Me too.

742
00:42:36,466 --> 00:42:37,511
Are you all right?

743
00:42:42,560 --> 00:42:44,344
Minister Farrakhan?

744
00:42:44,474 --> 00:42:47,913
That man is responsible
for my husband's death.

745
00:42:48,043 --> 00:42:49,305
I can't prove it.

746
00:42:49,436 --> 00:42:50,611
But I know is true.

747
00:42:50,742 --> 00:42:52,787
I know how you feel.

748
00:42:52,918 --> 00:42:55,137
I never believed James
Earl Ray acted alone

749
00:42:55,268 --> 00:42:56,617
when he killed Martin.

750
00:42:56,748 --> 00:42:59,054
There were things that
were never investigated.

751
00:42:59,185 --> 00:43:01,927
They don't want us
to know the truth.

752
00:43:02,057 --> 00:43:06,975
So much was taken away
from us and our kids.

753
00:43:07,106 --> 00:43:09,151
They may have killed
our husbands, Betty.

754
00:43:09,282 --> 00:43:11,458
But they didn't
kill their ideas.

755
00:43:11,589 --> 00:43:13,808
Those are still alive.

756
00:43:13,939 --> 00:43:17,507
What's important now is
for to carry them forward.

757
00:43:22,730 --> 00:43:23,775
Come on.

758
00:43:29,302 --> 00:43:32,087
Over the next few
years, we made progress.

759
00:43:32,218 --> 00:43:33,412
The number of African-American
elected officials

760
00:43:33,436 --> 00:43:35,569
more than doubled.

761
00:43:35,700 --> 00:43:39,181
And Coretta continued to
fight for social justice

762
00:43:39,312 --> 00:43:42,489
and a national
holiday for Martin.

763
00:43:42,620 --> 00:43:44,970
Betty, she went back to school.

764
00:43:45,100 --> 00:43:50,671
It was tough with six kids,
but we all helped out.

765
00:43:50,802 --> 00:43:51,846
We wanted her to...

766
00:43:51,977 --> 00:43:54,327
We needed her to succeed.

767
00:43:54,457 --> 00:43:56,285
And she did.

768
00:43:56,416 --> 00:43:59,158
Armed with her PhD,
she got her first job

769
00:43:59,288 --> 00:44:04,163
at Medgar Evers College in
Crown Heights, Brooklyn.

770
00:44:04,293 --> 00:44:08,167
Hey, you think because
twice your age I can't relate?

771
00:44:08,297 --> 00:44:10,560
Girlfriend, I've
been where you at.

772
00:44:10,691 --> 00:44:12,214
You don't need a man to survive.

773
00:44:12,345 --> 00:44:15,130
You just need some training
so you can get a good job,

774
00:44:15,261 --> 00:44:16,697
take care of yourself
and your baby.

775
00:44:16,828 --> 00:44:18,394
You understand?

776
00:44:18,525 --> 00:44:19,526
Good.

777
00:44:19,657 --> 00:44:20,919
Now here.

778
00:44:21,049 --> 00:44:23,573
Here, take this to pay
for child childcare.

779
00:44:23,704 --> 00:44:25,401
And get here on time tomorrow.

780
00:44:25,532 --> 00:44:26,620
OK?

781
00:44:26,751 --> 00:44:28,666
Don't say a word.

782
00:44:28,796 --> 00:44:30,798
People helped me
when I needed it.

783
00:44:30,929 --> 00:44:32,713
Just pass it along.

784
00:44:32,844 --> 00:44:33,844
Go on.

785
00:44:39,111 --> 00:44:41,591
They said it, but
I didn't believe it.

786
00:44:41,722 --> 00:44:46,248
The widow of Malcolm X
coming to Crown Heights

787
00:44:46,379 --> 00:44:49,861
to teach at the school
honoring my husband.

788
00:44:49,991 --> 00:44:52,124
Myrlie Evers?

789
00:44:52,254 --> 00:44:53,778
Myrlie Evers.

790
00:44:53,908 --> 00:44:54,909
Oh, my gosh.

791
00:44:55,040 --> 00:44:56,432
It's so... it's an honor.

792
00:44:58,913 --> 00:44:59,697
Honor to meet you.

793
00:44:59,827 --> 00:45:00,523
Honor.

794
00:45:00,654 --> 00:45:02,047
Honor is mine.

795
00:45:02,177 --> 00:45:03,831
So what made you
want to work here?

796
00:45:08,270 --> 00:45:11,491
Well, you remember the
documentary on Malcolm?

797
00:45:11,621 --> 00:45:13,536
It was about three years ago.

798
00:45:13,667 --> 00:45:19,325
Well, I took my girls to see
it and it was hard to watch.

799
00:45:19,455 --> 00:45:21,055
My daughter Qubilah
said something to me.

800
00:45:21,153 --> 00:45:24,852
She said, Mommy, you look
so helpless in the movie.

801
00:45:24,983 --> 00:45:26,854
And she was right.

802
00:45:26,985 --> 00:45:28,682
That's exactly how I felt.

803
00:45:28,813 --> 00:45:30,336
I understand that feeling.

804
00:45:30,466 --> 00:45:33,165
I never want to
feel that way again.

805
00:45:33,295 --> 00:45:35,950
I just want to help others.

806
00:45:36,081 --> 00:45:37,517
So what about you?

807
00:45:37,647 --> 00:45:39,647
How did you keep moving
after your husband's death?

808
00:45:39,693 --> 00:45:42,391
Well, with Medgar, we knew
for years they'd become in

809
00:45:42,522 --> 00:45:43,697
to kill him eventually.

810
00:45:43,828 --> 00:45:44,959
Even joked about it.

811
00:45:47,570 --> 00:45:52,097
But nothing can prepare you for
the reality when it happens.

812
00:45:52,227 --> 00:45:53,707
It takes a long time to heal.

813
00:45:53,838 --> 00:45:56,057
A part of you never really does.

814
00:45:56,188 --> 00:45:59,234
But then again, life...

815
00:46:04,674 --> 00:46:06,285
Is that an engagement ring?

816
00:46:06,415 --> 00:46:08,766
Yeah.

817
00:46:08,896 --> 00:46:10,419
I'm getting remarried
in two months.

818
00:46:10,550 --> 00:46:11,290
Really?

819
00:46:11,420 --> 00:46:12,420
Yes.

820
00:46:12,465 --> 00:46:14,162
Oh, I'm so happy for you.

821
00:46:14,293 --> 00:46:14,989
Thank you.

822
00:46:15,120 --> 00:46:15,947
Wow.

823
00:46:16,077 --> 00:46:16,904
How about you?

824
00:46:17,035 --> 00:46:19,080
Is there a man in your life?

825
00:46:19,211 --> 00:46:23,476
Only one, Malcolm.

826
00:46:37,925 --> 00:46:41,276
No!

827
00:46:41,407 --> 00:46:42,060
Get away!

828
00:46:42,190 --> 00:46:42,843
Mamma!

829
00:46:42,974 --> 00:46:43,626
What?

830
00:46:43,757 --> 00:46:44,497
What is it, baby?

831
00:46:44,627 --> 00:46:46,455
Mommy!

832
00:46:46,586 --> 00:46:47,456
What?

833
00:46:47,587 --> 00:46:48,457
They're here to kill you!

834
00:46:48,588 --> 00:46:50,024
No one's going to hurt me.

835
00:46:50,155 --> 00:46:52,157
Nothing's going to happen.

836
00:46:52,287 --> 00:46:54,028
I saw a man!

837
00:46:54,159 --> 00:46:55,159
You were dreaming.

838
00:46:55,203 --> 00:46:56,901
You were dreaming, sweetheart.

839
00:46:57,031 --> 00:46:59,555
Why didn't you tell us Daddy's
killers were still out there?

840
00:46:59,686 --> 00:47:01,122
What are you talking about?

841
00:47:01,253 --> 00:47:03,124
I saw an interview on TV.

842
00:47:03,255 --> 00:47:05,561
They said Daddy's real killers
were still on the loose.

843
00:47:05,692 --> 00:47:06,736
That's just stories, baby.

844
00:47:06,867 --> 00:47:08,564
That's just stories.

845
00:47:08,695 --> 00:47:10,610
Look, no one's going
to take anything away

846
00:47:10,740 --> 00:47:12,177
from us every again.

847
00:47:12,307 --> 00:47:13,352
You hear me?

848
00:47:13,482 --> 00:47:16,834
You are so smart
and so beautiful,

849
00:47:16,964 --> 00:47:18,748
you're going to
have a great future.

850
00:47:18,879 --> 00:47:21,969
You and your sisters are going
to make something of yourself.

851
00:47:22,100 --> 00:47:23,797
I know you will.

852
00:47:23,928 --> 00:47:25,755
Just focused on that, OK?

853
00:47:41,771 --> 00:47:42,555
Hold on.

854
00:47:42,685 --> 00:47:43,685
Hold on.

855
00:47:58,963 --> 00:48:01,879
Martin, Dexter, no horseplay.

856
00:48:12,237 --> 00:48:12,933
Hi.

857
00:48:13,064 --> 00:48:14,804
Well, hello there.

858
00:48:14,935 --> 00:48:15,980
Is your mamma here?

859
00:48:16,110 --> 00:48:17,230
She's learning the bus stop.

860
00:48:17,329 --> 00:48:18,939
Well, is that so?

861
00:48:19,070 --> 00:48:19,722
Oh.

862
00:48:19,853 --> 00:48:20,941
Hey, girl.

863
00:48:21,072 --> 00:48:22,072
Betty.

864
00:48:22,116 --> 00:48:23,378
Oh, I'm so glad to see you.

865
00:48:23,509 --> 00:48:24,727
We made it.

866
00:48:24,858 --> 00:48:27,687
Oh, girl, let me
see these beauties.

867
00:48:27,817 --> 00:48:29,297
You must be Dexter.

868
00:48:29,428 --> 00:48:30,472
Martin.

869
00:48:30,603 --> 00:48:31,952
Bernice and Yolanda.

870
00:48:32,083 --> 00:48:32,779
Did I get that right?

871
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,780
You sure did.

872
00:48:33,911 --> 00:48:35,390
And yours are?

873
00:48:35,521 --> 00:48:39,612
Attallah, Qubilah,
Ilyasah, Malikah, Malaak.

874
00:48:39,742 --> 00:48:41,396
And you all met Gamila.

875
00:48:41,527 --> 00:48:42,789
Come on in.
Come on.

876
00:48:42,920 --> 00:48:43,920
Come on.

877
00:48:48,490 --> 00:48:50,057
All done, Mamma.

878
00:48:50,188 --> 00:48:51,537
All right, you
two bring this out.

879
00:48:51,667 --> 00:48:54,627
But no serving until we
finish making our coffee.

880
00:48:54,757 --> 00:48:56,324
Come on, Yoki,
you take the plates.

881
00:48:59,371 --> 00:49:00,981
They're really getting along.

882
00:49:01,112 --> 00:49:01,939
I know.

883
00:49:02,069 --> 00:49:03,244
It's nice to see.

884
00:49:05,768 --> 00:49:07,945
So I heard you're planning
to speak before Congress

885
00:49:08,075 --> 00:49:09,381
about Martin's holiday.

886
00:49:09,511 --> 00:49:10,904
Well, I have to do something.

887
00:49:11,035 --> 00:49:13,298
They keep shooting it down.

888
00:49:13,428 --> 00:49:17,041
And have ever since it was
first introduced 18 years ago.

889
00:49:17,171 --> 00:49:19,434
They don't want to
give it to a Black man.

890
00:49:19,565 --> 00:49:22,394
It's like Malcolm said, sitting
at the table don't make you

891
00:49:22,524 --> 00:49:26,876
a diner, unless you eat some of
what's on the plate, you know?

892
00:49:27,007 --> 00:49:28,966
Well, I hope he
was wrong about that.

893
00:49:44,329 --> 00:49:45,330
What's wrong?

894
00:49:45,460 --> 00:49:46,984
I didn't upset, you did I?

895
00:49:47,114 --> 00:49:47,985
Oh, no, no.

896
00:49:48,115 --> 00:49:49,160
It's Qubilah.

897
00:49:49,290 --> 00:49:52,511
She's having nightmares again.

898
00:49:52,641 --> 00:49:54,774
I think of all my children,
she was the one most

899
00:49:54,904 --> 00:49:56,428
affected by Malcolm's death.

900
00:49:59,648 --> 00:50:03,348
Well, have you talked
with anyone about it?

901
00:50:03,478 --> 00:50:04,871
Maybe it's time you did.

902
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,264
For both your sakes.

903
00:50:06,394 --> 00:50:08,074
I could give you the
name of the doctor who

904
00:50:08,179 --> 00:50:09,397
met with my children.

905
00:50:09,528 --> 00:50:11,530
It may help.

906
00:50:11,660 --> 00:50:14,098
I don't think so.

907
00:50:14,228 --> 00:50:16,665
You know, after Martin
died, I saw on TV

908
00:50:16,796 --> 00:50:19,190
how you led that march down in
Memphis with your little ones

909
00:50:19,320 --> 00:50:20,930
at your side.

910
00:50:21,061 --> 00:50:24,934
You took them right into the
city where he was shot dead.

911
00:50:25,065 --> 00:50:27,111
I was so amazed.

912
00:50:27,241 --> 00:50:28,895
But it's not a choice
I would have made.

913
00:50:33,117 --> 00:50:35,293
It's something I had to do.

914
00:50:35,423 --> 00:50:36,555
There was no choice.

915
00:50:47,653 --> 00:50:50,134
I'm so proud of you, Qubilah.

916
00:50:50,264 --> 00:50:51,961
Princeton.

917
00:50:52,092 --> 00:50:53,876
Your daddy would
have be proud too.

918
00:50:54,007 --> 00:50:57,228
He used to say education is
our passport to the future.

919
00:50:57,358 --> 00:50:58,751
For tomorrow belongs
to the people

920
00:50:58,881 --> 00:51:00,144
who prepare for it today.

921
00:51:00,274 --> 00:51:02,320
You told me that so many times.

922
00:51:02,450 --> 00:51:03,712
I know.

923
00:51:03,843 --> 00:51:05,473
But I never get tired
of quote your daddy.

924
00:51:05,497 --> 00:51:06,150
Now come on, let's...

925
00:51:06,280 --> 00:51:08,456
Mamma, wait.

926
00:51:08,587 --> 00:51:10,589
What's the matter?

927
00:51:10,719 --> 00:51:12,547
I want to go home.

928
00:51:12,678 --> 00:51:13,548
What are you talking about?

929
00:51:13,679 --> 00:51:14,462
We just got here.

930
00:51:14,593 --> 00:51:15,594
You can't go home now.

931
00:51:15,724 --> 00:51:16,724
Please?

932
00:51:18,640 --> 00:51:20,947
Baby, I know you're nervous.

933
00:51:21,078 --> 00:51:24,211
But everyone's nervous when
they go away to college.

934
00:51:24,342 --> 00:51:26,083
You going to be fine.

935
00:51:26,213 --> 00:51:27,736
It's your time.

936
00:51:27,867 --> 00:51:32,045
Now you take your life in your
hands and you run with it.

937
00:51:32,176 --> 00:51:34,134
OK?

938
00:51:34,265 --> 00:51:35,004
Now come on.

939
00:51:35,135 --> 00:51:36,441
Let's go see your dorm.

940
00:51:36,571 --> 00:51:38,356
Shoot, I'm more
excited than you.

941
00:51:46,103 --> 00:51:47,365
Is this true?

942
00:51:47,495 --> 00:51:51,020
It can't come as a
surprise to you, Cori.

943
00:51:51,151 --> 00:51:54,807
Hoover spied on presidents,
senators, business leaders.

944
00:51:54,937 --> 00:51:57,375
And it did not stop there.

945
00:51:57,505 --> 00:52:00,508
Whatever dirty tricks that sick
son of a bitch could think of,

946
00:52:00,639 --> 00:52:02,467
he'd do.

947
00:52:02,597 --> 00:52:05,861
He didn't care about
your rights or mine.

948
00:52:05,992 --> 00:52:09,865
He spied on everyone from John
Lennon to Albert Einstein.

949
00:52:09,996 --> 00:52:12,651
Hell, he even
targeted the Kennedys.

950
00:52:12,781 --> 00:52:14,392
Martin and I
always suspected they

951
00:52:14,522 --> 00:52:16,698
were taping our conversations.

952
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:19,919
But I never knew they were
bugging our home, our bedroom,

953
00:52:20,049 --> 00:52:22,095
even our children.

954
00:52:22,226 --> 00:52:24,228
I want these tapes suppressed.

955
00:52:24,358 --> 00:52:27,535
They never should have
existed to begin with.

956
00:52:27,666 --> 00:52:28,773
But I... I think you should let...

957
00:52:28,797 --> 00:52:29,797
No.

958
00:52:32,714 --> 00:52:36,588
I will not let the evil forces
of this country murder Martin

959
00:52:36,718 --> 00:52:37,850
again.

960
00:52:37,980 --> 00:52:40,722
Cori, I know you're upset.

961
00:52:40,853 --> 00:52:43,682
And believe me, I think
you have every right to be.

962
00:52:43,812 --> 00:52:48,208
But are you sure this is
the way you want to proceed?

963
00:52:48,339 --> 00:52:50,558
It's a sensitive time.

964
00:52:50,689 --> 00:52:53,300
President Carter is committed to
pushing through your husband's

965
00:52:53,431 --> 00:52:54,736
holiday.

966
00:52:54,867 --> 00:52:57,435
If you go to work trying
to suppress these tapes,

967
00:52:57,565 --> 00:53:00,394
people are going to wonder what
it is you are trying to hide.

968
00:53:03,528 --> 00:53:04,528
I don't care.

969
00:53:07,488 --> 00:53:10,883
Well, then I'll
set the paperwork and motion.

970
00:53:15,453 --> 00:53:17,368
I'm very sorry
this had to happen.

971
00:53:21,154 --> 00:53:23,461
I'll give you a call
later on this afternoon.

972
00:53:27,116 --> 00:53:28,116
Ralph?

973
00:53:32,034 --> 00:53:34,036
Have you heard them?

974
00:53:34,167 --> 00:53:36,909
Do you know what's
on these tapes?

975
00:53:37,039 --> 00:53:39,651
I have.

976
00:53:39,781 --> 00:53:44,917
There are things on those tapes
that should never come out.

977
00:53:45,047 --> 00:53:46,875
Personal things.

978
00:54:03,414 --> 00:54:05,503
Class, today, we are
fortunate to have a very

979
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,026
special surprise visitor.

980
00:54:07,156 --> 00:54:08,941
She's in town to
testify to the UN

981
00:54:09,071 --> 00:54:12,597
before she flies to India
to meet Indira Gandhi.

982
00:54:12,727 --> 00:54:14,767
So I think you may get a
sense of the kind of person

983
00:54:14,860 --> 00:54:16,514
I'm talking about.

984
00:54:16,644 --> 00:54:20,953
I want you to extend a warm
welcome to my dear friend,

985
00:54:21,083 --> 00:54:22,781
Coretta Scott King.

986
00:54:25,349 --> 00:54:27,220
Thank you so much.

987
00:54:27,351 --> 00:54:32,399
I'm always happy to lend my
services to Betty's causes.

988
00:54:32,530 --> 00:54:35,010
Right now, all of you
are her biggest calls,

989
00:54:35,141 --> 00:54:37,186
because you're the future.

990
00:54:37,317 --> 00:54:39,624
I know graduation is
a few months from now.

991
00:54:39,754 --> 00:54:42,148
So I'm sure you're
wondering what it's like out

992
00:54:42,279 --> 00:54:43,845
in the world.

993
00:54:43,976 --> 00:54:47,153
Doing good it seems like an
abstraction when bills have

994
00:54:47,284 --> 00:54:49,851
to be paid and kids
gotten off to school.

995
00:54:49,982 --> 00:54:54,029
But the impulse to help better
the lives of your fellow man

996
00:54:54,160 --> 00:54:56,728
should never be
ignored or set aside.

997
00:54:56,858 --> 00:55:01,559
The fact is, in helping
others, we do help ourselves.

998
00:55:01,689 --> 00:55:05,954
That's why I fight to give women
a voice, the poor opportunity

999
00:55:06,085 --> 00:55:09,218
and children a peaceful world.

1000
00:55:09,349 --> 00:55:15,007
Their success, their empowerment
vastly improves my world.

1001
00:55:15,137 --> 00:55:17,314
We're all connected.

1002
00:55:17,444 --> 00:55:20,665
Now, I didn't come
here to preach.

1003
00:55:20,795 --> 00:55:25,539
So I'd like to answer
your questions, if I can.

1004
00:55:25,670 --> 00:55:27,350
Did you always see
yourself as an activist?

1005
00:55:27,454 --> 00:55:29,543
Oh, heavens no.

1006
00:55:31,371 --> 00:55:32,894
I wanted to be an opera singer.

1007
00:55:33,025 --> 00:55:34,548
I was dead set on it.

1008
00:55:34,679 --> 00:55:37,246
When I was your age, I was
very much like all of you.

1009
00:55:37,377 --> 00:55:39,248
Big plans.

1010
00:55:39,379 --> 00:55:41,947
But God intervened.

1011
00:55:42,077 --> 00:55:46,473
He introduced me to
someone extraordinary.

1012
00:55:46,604 --> 00:55:50,390
Martin taught me the
value of self-sacrifice.

1013
00:55:50,521 --> 00:55:51,739
Changed my life forever.

1014
00:55:57,092 --> 00:55:58,093
Yes?

1015
00:55:58,224 --> 00:55:59,094
Thank you.

1016
00:55:59,225 --> 00:56:00,574
Thank you for coming, girl.

1017
00:56:00,705 --> 00:56:02,533
I know you changed some
lives in there today.

1018
00:56:02,663 --> 00:56:03,903
Something they'll never forget.

1019
00:56:04,012 --> 00:56:05,797
Oh, looking at those
girls reminded me

1020
00:56:05,927 --> 00:56:07,407
of when Martin and I were young.

1021
00:56:07,538 --> 00:56:10,149
He was so charming
and full of hope.

1022
00:56:10,279 --> 00:56:11,280
Life was ahead of us.

1023
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:13,500
We had so many dreams.

1024
00:56:13,631 --> 00:56:16,677
Oh, things aren't as
clear as time passes.

1025
00:56:16,808 --> 00:56:19,376
Dreaming wasn't the only thing
Malcolm and I was doing back.

1026
00:56:23,075 --> 00:56:25,425
Oh, busy as always.

1027
00:56:25,556 --> 00:56:26,383
Traveling.

1028
00:56:26,513 --> 00:56:28,559
The kids are well though.

1029
00:56:28,689 --> 00:56:30,822
That's good.

1030
00:56:30,952 --> 00:56:35,217
Betty, I have to
ask you something.

1031
00:56:35,348 --> 00:56:38,133
What is it?

1032
00:56:38,264 --> 00:56:42,007
Was Malcolm faithful to you?

1033
00:56:42,137 --> 00:56:43,312
Yes.

1034
00:56:43,443 --> 00:56:44,618
Of course.

1035
00:56:44,749 --> 00:56:46,315
He was a devout Muslim.

1036
00:56:46,446 --> 00:56:47,446
Why are you asking?

1037
00:56:50,885 --> 00:56:53,540
I've never talked to
anyone about this before.

1038
00:56:59,285 --> 00:57:00,852
A package came to the house.

1039
00:57:00,982 --> 00:57:04,769
This was back in '64, just
before Martin was supposed

1040
00:57:04,899 --> 00:57:08,642
to go to Oslo to pick up
the Nobel Peace Prize.

1041
00:57:08,773 --> 00:57:13,734
It was addressed to him, but
I always opened his mail.

1042
00:57:13,865 --> 00:57:15,083
I'm sure they knew that.

1043
00:57:17,825 --> 00:57:20,349
It was tapes.

1044
00:57:20,480 --> 00:57:23,048
They were filthy, horrible.

1045
00:57:23,178 --> 00:57:25,006
A letter came with them.

1046
00:57:25,137 --> 00:57:26,704
Anonymous of course.

1047
00:57:26,834 --> 00:57:30,534
The person who sent them... well,
now I know it was the FBI...

1048
00:57:30,664 --> 00:57:34,842
Threatened to expose Martin
if he accepted the prize.

1049
00:57:34,973 --> 00:57:36,278
I never confronted him.

1050
00:57:36,409 --> 00:57:38,759
But Martin knew that
I had heard the tapes.

1051
00:57:38,890 --> 00:57:46,890
And he was
crestfallen, mortified.

1052
00:57:47,202 --> 00:57:49,204
But he was also brave.

1053
00:57:49,335 --> 00:57:50,684
He threw the tapes
in the garbage

1054
00:57:50,815 --> 00:57:56,429
and when and accepted
his Nobel Peace Prize.

1055
00:57:56,560 --> 00:57:58,823
I supported that choice.

1056
00:57:58,953 --> 00:57:59,953
I still do.

1057
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:06,047
Martin wasn't a saint.

1058
00:58:10,922 --> 00:58:14,882
But that was a big
omission and I loved him.

1059
00:58:18,233 --> 00:58:21,541
And he loved you too.

1060
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,325
I'm sure.

1061
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:35,729
Qubilah?

1062
00:58:35,860 --> 00:58:37,905
Mom, I'm in here.

1063
00:58:38,036 --> 00:58:40,517
What are you doing home, honey?

1064
00:58:40,647 --> 00:58:43,389
School's not on break
for another week.

1065
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:45,043
I want to drop out.

1066
00:58:45,173 --> 00:58:46,173
What?

1067
00:58:46,261 --> 00:58:47,349
Why?

1068
00:58:47,480 --> 00:58:49,308
Mamma, I don't
fit in at Princeton.

1069
00:58:49,438 --> 00:58:50,657
How can you say that?

1070
00:58:50,788 --> 00:58:52,485
You're just as smart
as anyone there.

1071
00:58:52,616 --> 00:58:53,696
It's not about being smart.

1072
00:58:53,791 --> 00:58:55,072
It's about the way
they look at me

1073
00:58:55,096 --> 00:58:56,968
as soon as they hear who I am.

1074
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,274
As if they expect me
and boots in a beret.

1075
00:58:59,405 --> 00:59:00,754
Ignore them.

1076
00:59:00,885 --> 00:59:02,253
You don't have to worry
about what people say.

1077
00:59:02,277 --> 00:59:03,277
This is your life.

1078
00:59:03,365 --> 00:59:04,149
I can't.

1079
00:59:04,279 --> 00:59:05,890
I'm not strong like you.

1080
00:59:13,593 --> 00:59:16,335
Understand, I love Daddy.

1081
00:59:16,465 --> 00:59:19,991
But I don't want to be
Malcolm X's daughter anymore.

1082
00:59:20,121 --> 00:59:23,472
I just need to go somewhere I
can be myself, whoever that is.

1083
00:59:23,603 --> 00:59:25,562
But you can do that
at Princeton, baby.

1084
00:59:25,692 --> 00:59:27,999
No I can't.

1085
00:59:28,129 --> 00:59:28,956
That's the point.

1086
00:59:29,087 --> 00:59:30,088
Not in this country.

1087
00:59:32,743 --> 00:59:35,006
I want to go to Paris.

1088
00:59:35,136 --> 00:59:37,225
I've already looked at schools.

1089
00:59:37,356 --> 00:59:40,228
I could start at the
Sorbonne in January.

1090
00:59:40,359 --> 00:59:43,710
But Princeton was
your dream, Qubilah.

1091
00:59:43,841 --> 00:59:44,929
No, it was your words.

1092
00:59:47,496 --> 00:59:49,455
I have to find my own way now.

1093
00:59:49,586 --> 00:59:50,674
Oh, God, baby, please.

1094
00:59:50,804 --> 00:59:52,414
Give it another chance, please.

1095
00:59:52,545 --> 00:59:53,545
I can't.

1096
00:59:56,680 --> 00:59:57,811
Please, let me go.

1097
01:00:01,467 --> 01:00:02,947
OK.

1098
01:00:03,077 --> 01:00:04,296
OK.

1099
01:00:13,784 --> 01:00:14,784
Thank you.

1100
01:00:21,574 --> 01:00:22,899
Betty began to host a
radio show in New York.

1101
01:00:22,923 --> 01:00:23,923
I used to listen to it.

1102
01:00:24,011 --> 01:00:26,187
I mean, I loved her.

1103
01:00:26,318 --> 01:00:28,712
She was funny and sassy.

1104
01:00:28,842 --> 01:00:32,324
And her message was always
about empowerment, especially

1105
01:00:32,454 --> 01:00:33,760
for women.

1106
01:00:33,891 --> 01:00:36,328
No one understood that
better than Coretta.

1107
01:00:36,458 --> 01:00:39,070
On the anniversary of
the march on Washington,

1108
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:42,116
she led the largest
demonstration in the capital

1109
01:00:42,247 --> 01:00:43,640
city had ever seen.

1110
01:00:43,770 --> 01:00:45,729
She presented to
Congress a petition

1111
01:00:45,859 --> 01:00:51,299
with over six million signatures
in support of the King holiday.

1112
01:00:51,430 --> 01:00:54,172
And as always, there
was opposition.

1113
01:00:54,302 --> 01:00:57,088
This time, Jesse
Helms led the charge.

1114
01:00:57,218 --> 01:01:01,222
And Coretta had to take him on.

1115
01:01:02,702 --> 01:01:03,790
Senator Helms has appointed

1116
01:01:03,921 --> 01:01:05,444
to petition the
federal judge to try

1117
01:01:05,574 --> 01:01:07,228
to get the FBI tapes unsealed.

1118
01:01:07,359 --> 01:01:10,362
Those tapes are illegal
and an invasion of my family.

1119
01:01:10,492 --> 01:01:12,035
Are you afraid of
what might be revealed

1120
01:01:12,059 --> 01:01:12,886
if they were to be released?

1121
01:01:13,017 --> 01:01:14,627
No.

1122
01:01:14,758 --> 01:01:16,997
And what about your husband's
known communist connection?

1123
01:01:17,021 --> 01:01:20,241
My husband had all sorts of
friends from all walks of life.

1124
01:01:20,372 --> 01:01:22,809
The sexual
allegations, Mrs. King?

1125
01:01:22,940 --> 01:01:24,811
How can you credit that trash?

1126
01:01:24,942 --> 01:01:26,987
You know what he stood for.

1127
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:29,555
The FBI never should
have made those tapes.

1128
01:01:29,686 --> 01:01:31,426
My husband and my
life is private.

1129
01:01:31,557 --> 01:01:34,473
And so are the lives of everyone
else that J. Edgar Hoover

1130
01:01:34,603 --> 01:01:35,779
invaded.

1131
01:01:35,909 --> 01:01:37,029
Was your marriage in trouble?

1132
01:01:42,655 --> 01:01:44,396
Mom.

1133
01:01:44,657 --> 01:01:46,572
Mom.

1134
01:01:46,703 --> 01:01:48,226
You all right, Mamma?

1135
01:01:48,356 --> 01:01:49,488
I'm fine, honey.

1136
01:01:54,580 --> 01:01:57,844
Don't listen to what
those people say.

1137
01:01:57,975 --> 01:02:01,369
Your father loved
me and I loved him.

1138
01:02:09,421 --> 01:02:11,162
It never stops.

1139
01:02:11,292 --> 01:02:12,685
They don't let it.

1140
01:02:12,816 --> 01:02:14,656
If they can't win one
way, they'll win another.

1141
01:02:14,774 --> 01:02:16,080
I don't know.

1142
01:02:16,210 --> 01:02:18,952
Maybe the country's
just not ready.

1143
01:02:19,126 --> 01:02:20,954
BETTY Listen, I
couldn't even give my husband

1144
01:02:21,085 --> 01:02:22,651
a stamp.

1145
01:02:22,782 --> 01:02:25,142
And here you are trying to get
yours whole national holiday.

1146
01:02:27,221 --> 01:02:29,528
You're so right.

1147
01:02:29,658 --> 01:02:31,835
So how's Qubilah?

1148
01:02:31,965 --> 01:02:34,576
Is she back home from Paris now?

1149
01:02:34,707 --> 01:02:40,104
Yeah, she came in last night
with a baby and no father.

1150
01:02:40,234 --> 01:02:42,515
I just keep thinking of how
disappointed Malcolm would be,

1151
01:02:42,541 --> 01:02:43,716
you know?

1152
01:02:43,847 --> 01:02:45,631
I know how you feel.

1153
01:02:45,762 --> 01:02:47,024
But she's back home now.

1154
01:02:47,154 --> 01:02:48,547
That's the main thing.

1155
01:02:48,677 --> 01:02:50,810
Yeah, I'm... I'm glad for that.

1156
01:02:51,158 --> 01:02:53,552
She can stay with me
and go back to school.

1157
01:02:53,682 --> 01:02:56,294
It'd be a new beginning for her.

1158
01:02:56,424 --> 01:02:57,817
Well, you know, listen, honey.

1159
01:02:57,948 --> 01:02:58,775
I got to go.

1160
01:02:58,905 --> 01:03:00,341
My show is about to start.

1161
01:03:00,472 --> 01:03:02,648
Oh, I love listening to
it whenever I'm in New York.

1162
01:03:02,779 --> 01:03:04,259
BETTY Well,
we're one of the few Black

1163
01:03:04,389 --> 01:03:05,869
owned stations in the country.

1164
01:03:05,999 --> 01:03:08,262
It's good we get to tell
our side of the story.

1165
01:03:08,393 --> 01:03:10,699
Oh, I... I... I got
to go right now.

1166
01:03:10,830 --> 01:03:12,223
I will call you later.

1167
01:03:12,353 --> 01:03:13,137
You stay strong.

1168
01:03:13,267 --> 01:03:14,268
Oh, I will.

1169
01:03:14,399 --> 01:03:15,095
And you too.

1170
01:03:15,226 --> 01:03:17,837
All right, bye bye.

1171
01:03:22,973 --> 01:03:24,670
Welcome, New York.

1172
01:03:24,801 --> 01:03:26,585
You're listening to
a "Forum for Women."

1173
01:03:26,715 --> 01:03:29,022
And I am your host, Dr. Shabazz.

1174
01:03:39,206 --> 01:03:42,906
Oh, he is a beautiful boy.

1175
01:03:43,036 --> 01:03:45,778
It's so good to have you back.

1176
01:03:45,909 --> 01:03:49,086
It's good to be home.

1177
01:03:49,216 --> 01:03:52,741
You know, I've been looking
at some colleges for you.

1178
01:03:52,872 --> 01:03:55,353
I was thinking you just thought
of Medgar Evers and then

1179
01:03:55,483 --> 01:03:58,922
transfer, if you wanted to.

1180
01:03:59,052 --> 01:04:00,052
Sure, Mamma.

1181
01:04:02,621 --> 01:04:04,057
Oh, baby.

1182
01:04:04,188 --> 01:04:06,407
I know it's not easy.

1183
01:04:06,538 --> 01:04:10,194
I raised you and
your sisters alone.

1184
01:04:10,324 --> 01:04:11,369
I think I'm going to bed.

1185
01:04:11,499 --> 01:04:12,805
I thought we'd have some dinner.

1186
01:04:12,936 --> 01:04:15,460
With the baby, I need
to get sleep when I can.

1187
01:04:15,590 --> 01:04:17,505
All right, you go to sleep.

1188
01:04:17,636 --> 01:04:20,944
I'll look after Malcolm
Jr. But later, we

1189
01:04:21,074 --> 01:04:23,424
go over the course catalog.

1190
01:04:23,555 --> 01:04:25,339
You're a mom now.

1191
01:04:25,470 --> 01:04:28,865
You have responsibilities.

1192
01:04:28,995 --> 01:04:31,084
I know.

1193
01:04:31,215 --> 01:04:32,215
All kinds.

1194
01:04:42,530 --> 01:04:44,358
Come on, baby.

1195
01:04:44,489 --> 01:04:46,056
Come on, boy.

1196
01:04:46,186 --> 01:04:47,405
Come to grandma.

1197
01:04:47,535 --> 01:04:50,016
Come on grandma.

1198
01:04:50,147 --> 01:04:51,147
Yes.

1199
01:04:53,802 --> 01:04:55,239
Breaking news.

1200
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:57,289
In anticipation of the
Senate vote on a holiday...

1201
01:04:57,328 --> 01:04:58,982
Mamma, Mamma it's Coretta.

1202
01:04:59,112 --> 01:05:01,549
Scott King
arrived today in Washington.

1203
01:05:01,680 --> 01:05:03,856
John Johnson joins
us with the story.

1204
01:05:03,987 --> 01:05:05,771
By a vote of 78 to 22,

1205
01:05:05,902 --> 01:05:08,426
the Senate today created
the 10th federal holiday

1206
01:05:08,556 --> 01:05:12,169
and the first ever for a Black
man, the Martin Luther King Jr.

1207
01:05:12,299 --> 01:05:13,474
Holiday.

1208
01:05:13,605 --> 01:05:15,085
The Bill now goes
to the White House

1209
01:05:15,215 --> 01:05:18,262
where President Reagan has
indicated he will sign it.

1210
01:05:18,392 --> 01:05:21,134
I'm humbled and I'm grateful.

1211
01:05:21,265 --> 01:05:24,355
And I know my husband
would have felt the same.

1212
01:05:24,485 --> 01:05:29,186
This is a holiday for all
of us to serve as a reminder

1213
01:05:29,316 --> 01:05:34,017
to resolve our differences in
a more respectful and peaceful

1214
01:05:34,147 --> 01:05:34,800
manner.

1215
01:05:34,931 --> 01:05:35,932
She did it.

1216
01:05:36,062 --> 01:05:36,933
She did it.

1217
01:05:37,063 --> 01:05:37,934
Oh, my God.
She did it.

1218
01:05:38,064 --> 01:05:38,760
She did it.

1219
01:05:38,891 --> 01:05:39,891
She did it.

1220
01:05:39,979 --> 01:05:41,589
She did it.

1221
01:05:41,720 --> 01:05:42,851
She did it.

1222
01:05:50,337 --> 01:05:53,601
In the early '90s Winnie
he and Nelson Mandela visited

1223
01:05:53,732 --> 01:05:54,732
Harlem.

1224
01:05:54,776 --> 01:05:57,083
Oh, I remember that day.

1225
01:05:57,214 --> 01:05:59,868
Betty was asked to
make the introduction.

1226
01:05:59,999 --> 01:06:03,002
And when Winnie
realized who Betty was,

1227
01:06:03,133 --> 01:06:09,269
she grabbed her and
held her so tight.

1228
01:06:09,400 --> 01:06:13,186
Both women wept in
front of the crowd.

1229
01:06:13,317 --> 01:06:16,276
I'll never forget how
emotional that moment was.

1230
01:06:16,407 --> 01:06:21,542
It was like a recognition of
what Betty had done to so many.

1231
01:06:26,939 --> 01:06:31,509
But Betty found it hardest to
help the one young woman she

1232
01:06:31,639 --> 01:06:33,902
cared about the most, Qubilah.

1233
01:06:44,261 --> 01:06:45,261
Qubilah?

1234
01:06:48,178 --> 01:06:49,178
Honey?

1235
01:06:56,708 --> 01:06:57,796
I'm sorry.

1236
01:06:57,926 --> 01:06:59,276
I must have the wrong apartment.

1237
01:06:59,406 --> 01:07:01,191
Mrs. Shabazz.

1238
01:07:01,321 --> 01:07:03,584
It's me, Mike.

1239
01:07:03,715 --> 01:07:05,369
Oh, you don't remember me?

1240
01:07:05,499 --> 01:07:09,808
It's, uh, Michael
Fitzpatrick from 10th grade.

1241
01:07:09,938 --> 01:07:10,938
Oh, yes.

1242
01:07:10,983 --> 01:07:11,723
Of course.

1243
01:07:11,853 --> 01:07:13,246
Yeah, yeah.

1244
01:07:13,377 --> 01:07:14,876
Qubilah didn't tell me
she was living with anyone.

1245
01:07:14,900 --> 01:07:16,336
Uh, no.

1246
01:07:16,467 --> 01:07:19,383
No, I'm, uh, just crashing
there a couple of days.

1247
01:07:19,513 --> 01:07:20,166
Where is she?

1248
01:07:20,297 --> 01:07:21,515
Hey, Mamma Betty.

1249
01:07:21,646 --> 01:07:23,561
Hey, baby.

1250
01:07:23,691 --> 01:07:26,085
How are you doing?

1251
01:07:26,216 --> 01:07:27,391
I brought you something.

1252
01:07:27,521 --> 01:07:29,306
Thank you.

1253
01:07:29,436 --> 01:07:31,482
BETTY Where's your mama?

1254
01:07:31,612 --> 01:07:33,614
I don't know.

1255
01:07:33,745 --> 01:07:37,618
Baby, you want to come visit
with grandma for a little?

1256
01:07:37,749 --> 01:07:38,880
Come on.

1257
01:07:39,011 --> 01:07:41,535
We can have fun together.

1258
01:07:41,666 --> 01:07:43,059
I want to stay with mamma.

1259
01:07:49,282 --> 01:07:52,329
Hey, baby, look who showed up.

1260
01:07:52,459 --> 01:07:53,765
Put your shirt on.

1261
01:07:53,895 --> 01:07:55,897
Yeah, OK.

1262
01:07:56,028 --> 01:07:57,028
No problem.

1263
01:08:00,946 --> 01:08:02,078
Hey, Mamma.

1264
01:08:02,208 --> 01:08:05,255
Hey, baby.

1265
01:08:05,385 --> 01:08:06,908
You want a drink?

1266
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:08,606
You know I don't drink.

1267
01:08:08,736 --> 01:08:10,410
What makes you think
I was offering alcohol?

1268
01:08:10,434 --> 01:08:11,174
Nothing.

1269
01:08:11,304 --> 01:08:13,872
Nothing, honey.

1270
01:08:14,002 --> 01:08:16,483
I'm sorry, Mamma.

1271
01:08:16,614 --> 01:08:20,139
I'm happy to see you.

1272
01:08:20,270 --> 01:08:25,231
Hey, isn't it good
to see Mamma Betty?

1273
01:08:25,362 --> 01:08:29,888
Going into the other room
so we can talk a minute.

1274
01:08:30,018 --> 01:08:31,803
What are you doing here?

1275
01:08:31,933 --> 01:08:32,804
Why didn't you call?

1276
01:08:32,934 --> 01:08:34,545
I tried.

1277
01:08:34,675 --> 01:08:36,697
I wanted to let you know I
sold the place in Mount Vernon

1278
01:08:36,721 --> 01:08:38,940
and I'm moving into
a condo in Yonkers.

1279
01:08:39,071 --> 01:08:41,639
I was thinking Malcolm Jr.
Could stay with me for a while.

1280
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:42,814
There's plenty of room.

1281
01:08:42,944 --> 01:08:44,163
Why?

1282
01:08:44,294 --> 01:08:45,991
Do you think I can't
take care of him?

1283
01:08:46,122 --> 01:08:46,992
I know you can.

1284
01:08:47,123 --> 01:08:48,559
You're his mamma.

1285
01:08:48,689 --> 01:08:50,430
It's just, you're
in between jobs.

1286
01:08:50,561 --> 01:08:54,434
No, I'm working at
a check cashing place.

1287
01:08:54,565 --> 01:08:57,785
Why are you looking
at me like that?

1288
01:08:57,916 --> 01:09:02,703
Not good enough for your
Princeton educated daughter?

1289
01:09:02,834 --> 01:09:04,140
Still so proud of me.

1290
01:09:04,270 --> 01:09:06,446
You know I am.

1291
01:09:06,577 --> 01:09:09,710
Honey, you're a
warm, sensitive soul.

1292
01:09:09,841 --> 01:09:10,841
I love...

1293
01:09:10,885 --> 01:09:12,278
I wished you'd stop saying.

1294
01:09:12,409 --> 01:09:13,409
It's true, baby.

1295
01:09:13,453 --> 01:09:15,063
I know.

1296
01:09:15,194 --> 01:09:16,194
That's a problem.

1297
01:09:28,294 --> 01:09:29,034
This model.

1298
01:09:29,165 --> 01:09:30,470
That's my type.

1299
01:09:30,601 --> 01:09:34,953
Oh, girl, look at these.

1300
01:09:35,083 --> 01:09:37,085
Oh, I couldn't wear those.

1301
01:09:37,216 --> 01:09:37,869
Why?

1302
01:09:37,999 --> 01:09:39,305
Too flashy?

1303
01:09:39,436 --> 01:09:40,915
I'd wind up on the floor.

1304
01:09:41,046 --> 01:09:41,699
No you won't.

1305
01:09:41,829 --> 01:09:42,526
Come on.

1306
01:09:42,656 --> 01:09:44,223
They sexy.

1307
01:09:44,354 --> 01:09:46,660
You afraid the men
may take notice?

1308
01:09:46,791 --> 01:09:48,575
Let's see.

1309
01:09:48,706 --> 01:09:51,448
Must be somebody... oh.

1310
01:09:51,578 --> 01:09:53,101
He is fine.

1311
01:09:53,232 --> 01:09:54,929
You think he's
fine, you wear them.

1312
01:09:55,060 --> 01:09:56,322
I won't, girl, please.

1313
01:09:56,453 --> 01:09:57,280
I can't wear those.

1314
01:09:57,410 --> 01:09:58,455
Why not?

1315
01:09:58,585 --> 01:10:00,196
I won't be able
to dance in them.

1316
01:10:00,326 --> 01:10:01,326
You hungry?

1317
01:10:01,414 --> 01:10:02,414
Mm-hmm.

1318
01:10:02,459 --> 01:10:05,244
Oh, I got you a new something.

1319
01:10:05,375 --> 01:10:06,898
It's a cosmetics big.

1320
01:10:07,028 --> 01:10:09,509
It's 'cause you always
carrying that plastic sack

1321
01:10:09,640 --> 01:10:11,294
with your lipsticks in it.

1322
01:10:11,424 --> 01:10:14,384
Now, you know I couldn't be seen
would you like that anymore.

1323
01:10:14,514 --> 01:10:15,733
I love it.

1324
01:10:15,863 --> 01:10:17,623
But, girlfriend, you
may as well give up now.

1325
01:10:17,691 --> 01:10:20,390
I'll never be able to
accessorize as well as you.

1326
01:10:20,520 --> 01:10:22,740
And their hair is
always perfect.

1327
01:10:22,870 --> 01:10:25,046
Well, it's all
about the rollers.

1328
01:10:28,093 --> 01:10:30,138
Poor little Malcolm.

1329
01:10:30,269 --> 01:10:32,924
Qubilah's been taking them
all around the country.

1330
01:10:33,054 --> 01:10:36,841
She just can't seem to
settle down anywhere.

1331
01:10:36,971 --> 01:10:39,452
She's been drinking too.

1332
01:10:39,583 --> 01:10:41,454
Oh.

1333
01:10:41,585 --> 01:10:44,327
Every time I go see her,
she says, don't worry.

1334
01:10:44,457 --> 01:10:46,242
I'm doing fine.

1335
01:10:46,372 --> 01:10:49,506
It's like I can't
reach her anymore.

1336
01:10:49,636 --> 01:10:53,510
And I wonder sometimes, where
that little girl I used to know

1337
01:10:53,640 --> 01:10:55,163
has disappeared to.

1338
01:10:55,294 --> 01:10:57,775
Oh, she's still in there.

1339
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:01,561
It hasn't been easy for
any of our children.

1340
01:11:01,692 --> 01:11:03,520
It's not something
they had a hand in.

1341
01:11:03,650 --> 01:11:05,913
But they have paid the price.

1342
01:11:06,044 --> 01:11:07,263
I know.

1343
01:11:07,393 --> 01:11:09,177
I know.

1344
01:11:09,308 --> 01:11:12,180
When Malcolm was killed, he
left a path of destruction

1345
01:11:12,311 --> 01:11:16,097
I feel like I just
can't ever fix.

1346
01:11:16,228 --> 01:11:17,925
It makes me so angry, Cori.

1347
01:11:24,410 --> 01:11:27,065
Live from New York
City, Gabe Pressman's "Channel"

1348
01:11:27,195 --> 01:11:30,068
"4 News Forum" with your
host Gabe Pressman.

1349
01:11:30,198 --> 01:11:32,418
Today's guest,
Dr. Betty Shabazz,

1350
01:11:32,549 --> 01:11:36,379
widow of the controversial
civil rights figure Malcolm X.

1351
01:11:36,509 --> 01:11:38,468
Betty, it's good to see you.

1352
01:11:38,598 --> 01:11:40,358
And thank you for coming
in to speak with me.

1353
01:11:40,470 --> 01:11:42,036
It's my pleasure, Gabe.

1354
01:11:42,167 --> 01:11:44,865
You were one of the people
who were kind to my husband.

1355
01:11:44,996 --> 01:11:48,782
You know, I first met him
on a street corner in Harlem.

1356
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:51,219
I saw his brilliance even then.

1357
01:11:51,350 --> 01:11:53,483
He was changing at the end
of his life, wasn't he?

1358
01:11:53,613 --> 01:11:55,267
Yes, he was.

1359
01:11:55,398 --> 01:11:58,226
That's why it makes me so
sad that he didn't have time

1360
01:11:58,357 --> 01:12:00,596
to communicate those changes
to the people that couldn't get

1361
01:12:00,620 --> 01:12:03,580
the early image of him
out of their minds.

1362
01:12:03,710 --> 01:12:06,496
Which brings us to the
reason for our interview.

1363
01:12:06,626 --> 01:12:08,672
No doubt, you've heard of
the upcoming film "Brother"

1364
01:12:08,802 --> 01:12:09,977
Minister."

1365
01:12:10,108 --> 01:12:11,892
It hasn't been
released, but I'd like

1366
01:12:12,023 --> 01:12:14,460
to show you a clip I managed
to obtain, if that's all right?

1367
01:12:18,072 --> 01:12:19,639
Yeah.

1368
01:12:19,770 --> 01:12:22,207
I love the Elijah Muhammad
enough that if you attacked

1369
01:12:22,338 --> 01:12:24,949
him, I'll kill you.

1370
01:12:25,079 --> 01:12:26,603
Love casts out fear.

1371
01:12:26,733 --> 01:12:28,431
We don't give a damn
about no White man law

1372
01:12:28,561 --> 01:12:30,955
when you attack what we love.

1373
01:12:31,085 --> 01:12:32,652
What do you got to say about it?

1374
01:12:32,783 --> 01:12:34,132
Did you teach Malcolm?

1375
01:12:34,262 --> 01:12:36,526
Did you clean up Malcolm?

1376
01:12:36,656 --> 01:12:38,789
Was he your traitor
or was he ours?

1377
01:12:38,919 --> 01:12:41,531
And if we dealt with him the way
a nation deals with a traitor,

1378
01:12:41,661 --> 01:12:43,576
then what the hell
business is that of yours?

1379
01:12:47,406 --> 01:12:50,322
Betty, do you
believe that Farrakhan

1380
01:12:50,453 --> 01:12:55,022
had anything to do with the
slaying of your husband?

1381
01:12:55,153 --> 01:12:57,416
Of course, yes.

1382
01:12:57,547 --> 01:12:58,809
Yes.

1383
01:12:58,939 --> 01:13:00,463
I mean, it was a matter of...

1384
01:13:00,593 --> 01:13:02,203
It was a badge of honor.

1385
01:13:02,334 --> 01:13:03,814
I mean, nobody kept it a secret.

1386
01:13:03,944 --> 01:13:05,076
Everybody talked about it.

1387
01:13:08,993 --> 01:13:11,212
Malcolm X is back in
the news after his widow

1388
01:13:11,343 --> 01:13:14,781
Betty Shabazz named Nation of
Islam leader Louis Farrakhan

1389
01:13:14,912 --> 01:13:17,654
as the man responsible for
her husband's assassination

1390
01:13:17,784 --> 01:13:21,397
30 years ago in the
Audubon Ballroom in Harlem.

1391
01:13:21,527 --> 01:13:23,311
Now minister Farrakhan
is fighting back.

1392
01:13:23,442 --> 01:13:26,619
Today, he filed a
$2.4 billion lawsuit

1393
01:13:26,750 --> 01:13:28,447
against the "New
York Post" for libel

1394
01:13:28,578 --> 01:13:30,928
after it repeated
the allegations.

1395
01:13:42,548 --> 01:13:43,636
Hello.

1396
01:13:43,767 --> 01:13:46,291
Mrs. Betty Shabazz?

1397
01:13:46,422 --> 01:13:47,858
Yes.

1398
01:13:47,988 --> 01:13:50,382
Will you accept a collect
call from Qubilah Shabazz?

1399
01:13:50,513 --> 01:13:52,036
Yes, of course.

1400
01:13:52,166 --> 01:13:52,906
Mamma.

1401
01:13:53,037 --> 01:13:54,430
Honey, where are you?

1402
01:13:54,560 --> 01:13:56,519
They said they was
going to kill them?

1403
01:13:56,649 --> 01:13:57,737
Kill who?

1404
01:13:57,868 --> 01:13:58,956
Farrakhan.

1405
01:13:59,086 --> 01:14:00,479
But I swear I
didn't do it, Mamma.

1406
01:14:00,610 --> 01:14:03,134
I didn't do it.

1407
01:14:03,264 --> 01:14:04,570
Honey, where are you?

1408
01:14:04,701 --> 01:14:05,484
Where are you?

1409
01:14:05,615 --> 01:14:06,615
Mamma.

1410
01:14:13,231 --> 01:14:15,320
Oh, baby.

1411
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:17,191
Are you OK?

1412
01:14:17,322 --> 01:14:18,758
Just get me out of here, Mamma.

1413
01:14:18,889 --> 01:14:19,629
I will.

1414
01:14:19,759 --> 01:14:20,499
I will.

1415
01:14:20,630 --> 01:14:22,327
Oh, what happened?

1416
01:14:22,458 --> 01:14:23,154
Sit.

1417
01:14:23,284 --> 01:14:25,765
What's going on?

1418
01:14:25,896 --> 01:14:30,030
I saw what you said on TV
and how Farrakhan reacted.

1419
01:14:30,161 --> 01:14:33,947
I talked to Michael about
taking him out to protect you,

1420
01:14:34,078 --> 01:14:35,166
to keep you safe.

1421
01:14:35,296 --> 01:14:36,167
I got scared, Mamma.

1422
01:14:36,297 --> 01:14:38,778
I didn't mean for him to do it.

1423
01:14:38,909 --> 01:14:41,738
I said no right away.

1424
01:14:41,868 --> 01:14:43,130
You believe me, don't you?

1425
01:14:43,261 --> 01:14:46,264
Of course, I do.

1426
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:48,179
They took Malcolm Jr.

1427
01:14:48,309 --> 01:14:49,093
Oh, no, no.

1428
01:14:49,223 --> 01:14:50,573
Baby, don't... it's OK.

1429
01:14:50,703 --> 01:14:52,618
He's with me.

1430
01:14:52,749 --> 01:14:54,490
Don't you worry, baby.

1431
01:14:54,620 --> 01:14:56,772
I'm going to do whatever it
takes to get you out of here.

1432
01:14:56,796 --> 01:14:59,146
You hear me?

1433
01:14:59,277 --> 01:15:01,540
You know me.

1434
01:15:01,671 --> 01:15:02,759
I love you, Qubilah.

1435
01:15:06,197 --> 01:15:07,459
I love you too, Mamma.

1436
01:15:07,590 --> 01:15:08,721
I know, baby.

1437
01:15:08,852 --> 01:15:10,680
Now you be strong.

1438
01:15:10,810 --> 01:15:12,943
It's going to be all right.

1439
01:15:22,213 --> 01:15:22,996
Listen to me.

1440
01:15:23,127 --> 01:15:23,910
I... I need you to understand...

1441
01:15:24,041 --> 01:15:24,345
Michael.

1442
01:15:24,476 --> 01:15:25,346
Michael.

1443
01:15:25,477 --> 01:15:26,739
How could I not want you to.

1444
01:15:26,870 --> 01:15:28,262
Right, well,

1445
01:15:28,393 --> 01:15:29,220
understand because this is
something I want to make

1446
01:15:29,350 --> 01:15:30,830
sure isn't just idle chat.

1447
01:15:30,961 --> 01:15:32,440
Michael, I have a lot at stake.

1448
01:15:32,571 --> 01:15:33,354
I lost my father and I'm at
risk of losing my mother.

1449
01:15:33,485 --> 01:15:34,965
Understand?

1450
01:15:35,095 --> 01:15:36,619
Do you understand?

1451
01:15:36,749 --> 01:15:39,491
Yeah.

1452
01:15:39,622 --> 01:15:40,753
Where'd they get it?

1453
01:15:40,884 --> 01:15:42,320
Michael Fitzpatrick.

1454
01:15:42,450 --> 01:15:44,540
It turns out he was
working on the FBI payroll.

1455
01:15:44,670 --> 01:15:45,932
Oh, my God.

1456
01:15:46,063 --> 01:15:47,543
She... she didn't
mean what she says.

1457
01:15:47,673 --> 01:15:50,110
She was set up.

1458
01:15:50,241 --> 01:15:52,548
We need to mount an
aggressive defense.

1459
01:15:52,678 --> 01:15:56,029
Stress Qubilah's
substance abuse problem.

1460
01:15:56,160 --> 01:15:58,118
She doesn't have
anything like that.

1461
01:15:58,249 --> 01:16:01,078
Betty, this is no
time to be proud.

1462
01:16:01,208 --> 01:16:04,342
She's facing a sentence
of up to 90 years.

1463
01:16:04,472 --> 01:16:05,778
You want to save her, don't you?

1464
01:16:05,909 --> 01:16:06,910
Yes.

1465
01:16:07,040 --> 01:16:08,651
Of course.

1466
01:16:08,781 --> 01:16:11,218
One thing working in our favor
is the tremendous outpouring

1467
01:16:11,349 --> 01:16:13,220
of support we're getting
from our community.

1468
01:16:13,351 --> 01:16:15,309
Farrakhan's people
have reached out.

1469
01:16:15,440 --> 01:16:22,012
He's offering to host a
fundraising effort for Qubilah.

1470
01:16:22,142 --> 01:16:23,709
Why would he do that?

1471
01:16:23,840 --> 01:16:26,407
To dispute he had anything
to do with Malcolm's death.

1472
01:16:26,538 --> 01:16:30,368
And show a united
front with your family.

1473
01:16:30,498 --> 01:16:33,719
You'd have to be there.

1474
01:16:33,850 --> 01:16:35,503
So you're asking
me to let Farrakhan

1475
01:16:35,634 --> 01:16:38,681
off the hook to save Qubilah.

1476
01:16:38,811 --> 01:16:44,034
The DA will never prosecute if
Farrakhan says she's innocent.

1477
01:16:54,087 --> 01:16:56,263
The forecast, mostly sunny
skies today with briskly...

1478
01:16:57,177 --> 01:16:58,177
winds.

1479
01:16:58,222 --> 01:16:59,342
Expect a high of 52 degrees.

1480
01:16:59,440 --> 01:17:00,440
All right.

1481
01:17:09,886 --> 01:17:10,538
Ooh!

1482
01:17:10,669 --> 01:17:12,062
Come in!

1483
01:17:12,192 --> 01:17:13,280
Oh.

1484
01:17:13,411 --> 01:17:14,194
Oh, my God.

1485
01:17:14,325 --> 01:17:14,891
It's so good to see you.

1486
01:17:15,021 --> 01:17:15,805
And you.

1487
01:17:15,935 --> 01:17:16,935
How you doing?

1488
01:17:17,023 --> 01:17:18,372
I'm better now.

1489
01:17:18,503 --> 01:17:19,156
Come on in.

1490
01:17:19,286 --> 01:17:21,419
Come on.

1491
01:17:21,549 --> 01:17:26,467
And then she walks in, Qubilah.

1492
01:17:26,598 --> 01:17:31,211
She looks so lost
and vulnerable.

1493
01:17:31,342 --> 01:17:35,694
But then all of a sudden, it
was like I could see her again.

1494
01:17:35,825 --> 01:17:38,566
My little girl.

1495
01:17:38,697 --> 01:17:41,221
All my life have been
trying to protect my kids.

1496
01:17:41,352 --> 01:17:44,921
And now she's in prison because
I couldn't keep my mouth shut.

1497
01:17:45,051 --> 01:17:47,247
All these years, I didn't want
to talk about Malcolm's death

1498
01:17:47,271 --> 01:17:48,271
because it...

1499
01:17:48,359 --> 01:17:50,622
It made it real.

1500
01:17:50,753 --> 01:17:53,146
And now when you
finally do, they

1501
01:17:53,277 --> 01:17:57,150
ask you to forgive the man that
you believe killed your husband

1502
01:17:57,368 --> 01:17:59,544
to save your little girl.

1503
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:01,894
Cori, I don't
know if I can do it.

1504
01:18:02,025 --> 01:18:04,767
Oh, Betty.

1505
01:18:04,897 --> 01:18:07,595
Sometimes, to protect
the ones we love,

1506
01:18:07,726 --> 01:18:09,685
we have to do the
thing that's hardest.

1507
01:18:16,604 --> 01:18:19,346
Coretta was right.

1508
01:18:19,477 --> 01:18:23,350
Betty stood up in the Apollo
Theater beside Farrakhan.

1509
01:18:23,481 --> 01:18:24,481
I was there.

1510
01:18:27,877 --> 01:18:29,966
She spoke so powerfully.

1511
01:18:30,096 --> 01:18:33,578
Her speech was broadcast
into churches and mosques

1512
01:18:33,709 --> 01:18:35,145
across the nation.

1513
01:18:35,275 --> 01:18:39,236
And after that, charges
against Qubilah were dropped.

1514
01:18:39,366 --> 01:18:42,543
But Qubilah's personal
struggles continued.

1515
01:18:42,674 --> 01:18:45,677
Malcolm Jr. went
to live with Betty.

1516
01:18:45,808 --> 01:18:47,461
It was tough for him.

1517
01:18:47,592 --> 01:18:50,682
You know, like any kid, he just
wanted to be with his mother.

1518
01:18:58,559 --> 01:19:00,779
Here you go, honey.

1519
01:19:00,910 --> 01:19:01,954
Don't do that, please.

1520
01:19:08,221 --> 01:19:10,920
Well, aren't you going to eat?

1521
01:19:11,050 --> 01:19:13,400
I'm not hungry.

1522
01:19:13,531 --> 01:19:14,750
You got to eat something.

1523
01:19:17,622 --> 01:19:21,017
Look, maybe after dinner, I'll
take you bowling or something,

1524
01:19:21,147 --> 01:19:22,018
OK?

1525
01:19:22,148 --> 01:19:23,019
What would you like to do?

1526
01:19:23,149 --> 01:19:24,455
I want to go home to Mamma.

1527
01:19:24,585 --> 01:19:25,369
Sweetie, your mamma

1528
01:19:25,499 --> 01:19:26,283
can't take you right now.

1529
01:19:26,413 --> 01:19:27,501
You know that.

1530
01:19:27,632 --> 01:19:28,328
Why?

1531
01:19:28,459 --> 01:19:30,330
Because you say so.

1532
01:19:30,461 --> 01:19:32,637
Because
she's getting things together.

1533
01:19:32,768 --> 01:19:38,817
Look, I know it's not easy,
but please, try and understand.

1534
01:19:38,948 --> 01:19:40,079
I want to go back.

1535
01:19:40,210 --> 01:19:41,820
Well, you can't.

1536
01:19:41,951 --> 01:19:42,647
Why?

1537
01:19:42,778 --> 01:19:44,736
Because you can't.

1538
01:19:44,867 --> 01:19:47,391
I wish you could, but you can't.

1539
01:19:47,521 --> 01:19:48,672
Now that's just the way it is.

1540
01:19:48,696 --> 01:19:49,696
Now eat your food.

1541
01:20:30,695 --> 01:20:38,695
Oh, my... Malcolm.

1542
01:20:41,880 --> 01:20:42,880
Malcolm.

1543
01:20:59,680 --> 01:21:00,377
Hey, what are you doing?

1544
01:21:00,507 --> 01:21:01,944
Don't stand there.

1545
01:21:02,074 --> 01:21:03,728
You OK, kid?

1546
01:21:03,859 --> 01:21:05,251
Are you OK?

1547
01:21:05,382 --> 01:21:07,775
I... I saw someone
putting her on a stretcher.

1548
01:21:07,906 --> 01:21:10,474
Saw who?

1549
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:12,215
My... my grandma.

1550
01:21:12,345 --> 01:21:13,999
Grandma?

1551
01:21:14,130 --> 01:21:15,970
She... she must have
walked down the hall coming

1552
01:21:16,045 --> 01:21:17,785
to look for me.

1553
01:21:17,916 --> 01:21:20,963
I didn't think she
was going to do that.

1554
01:21:21,093 --> 01:21:24,140
Come with me, kid.

1555
01:21:24,270 --> 01:21:25,552
Are you going to
send me home now?

1556
01:21:25,576 --> 01:21:26,882
It's going to be OK.

1557
01:21:27,012 --> 01:21:28,511
I didn't mean for a
Mamma Betty to get hurt.

1558
01:21:28,535 --> 01:21:29,991
We're going to look
into that, all right?

1559
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:31,015
I'm sorry.

1560
01:21:48,686 --> 01:21:49,686
Auntie Coretta.

1561
01:21:55,911 --> 01:21:57,129
I don't want Mamma to go.

1562
01:21:57,260 --> 01:21:58,260
Oh, baby.

1563
01:22:00,872 --> 01:22:01,655
It's my fault.

1564
01:22:01,786 --> 01:22:02,395
Oh, no, no.

1565
01:22:02,526 --> 01:22:03,962
No, no, child.

1566
01:22:04,093 --> 01:22:05,137
No, no.

1567
01:22:09,446 --> 01:22:10,316
Talk to her.

1568
01:22:10,447 --> 01:22:11,709
She wants to see you.

1569
01:22:11,839 --> 01:22:13,319
Tell her I'm sorry.

1570
01:22:13,450 --> 01:22:14,842
She knows you are.

1571
01:22:14,973 --> 01:22:16,975
She understands everything.

1572
01:22:19,630 --> 01:22:21,327
I pray you're right.

1573
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:39,432
Oh, God.

1574
01:22:39,563 --> 01:22:41,869
What have they done to you?

1575
01:22:46,265 --> 01:22:47,614
Oh, baby.

1576
01:22:55,144 --> 01:22:58,147
Can you hear me?

1577
01:23:01,106 --> 01:23:03,848
Oh, Betty.

1578
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:11,979
It wasn't... it wasn't
the boy's fault. Tell him.

1579
01:23:13,423 --> 01:23:16,643
I will.

1580
01:23:16,774 --> 01:23:23,172
I just wish I had
a little longer.

1581
01:23:23,302 --> 01:23:24,651
You have time.

1582
01:23:24,782 --> 01:23:25,826
Plenty of time.

1583
01:23:29,743 --> 01:23:34,835
Hey, do you remember that
time that we went to the spa

1584
01:23:34,966 --> 01:23:37,664
and you wanted me to swim?

1585
01:23:37,795 --> 01:23:40,189
I didn't want to be
seen in a bathing suit

1586
01:23:40,319 --> 01:23:42,843
so got them to close the pool.

1587
01:23:42,974 --> 01:23:46,108
And I asked you how you did it.

1588
01:23:46,238 --> 01:23:50,982
And you said, girlfriend, I've
been an activist all my life.

1589
01:23:51,113 --> 01:23:54,072
You think I can get them to
close a pool for one hour?

1590
01:23:56,857 --> 01:23:59,295
Oh, we laughed so hard at that.

1591
01:23:59,425 --> 01:24:01,993
You teased me about my figure.

1592
01:24:02,124 --> 01:24:04,996
Said the men didn't know
what they were missing.

1593
01:24:05,127 --> 01:24:10,001
And I told you that you was the
one that was the real catch.

1594
01:24:15,572 --> 01:24:17,791
That was true.

1595
01:24:17,922 --> 01:24:19,532
You were.

1596
01:24:19,663 --> 01:24:22,144
Well, I've been thinking
about that time a lot lately.

1597
01:24:22,274 --> 01:24:24,276
And I want to do it again.

1598
01:24:24,407 --> 01:24:26,061
So I'm going to
look into it just

1599
01:24:26,191 --> 01:24:28,715
as soon as you feeling better.

1600
01:24:28,846 --> 01:24:31,762
But right now, you need to
rest and get well and take care

1601
01:24:31,892 --> 01:24:33,242
of yourself.

1602
01:24:33,372 --> 01:24:34,895
Because I don't
want you getting all

1603
01:24:35,026 --> 01:24:39,030
worn out so that you
won't be able to go.

1604
01:24:39,161 --> 01:24:43,426
You just let us take
care of you for a while.

1605
01:24:43,556 --> 01:24:44,556
OK?

1606
01:25:00,051 --> 01:25:08,015
Betty, hung on for 23 days
before mercifully she passed.

1607
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,539
I saw her there.

1608
01:25:09,669 --> 01:25:11,236
I... I... I wasn't the only on.

1609
01:25:11,367 --> 01:25:13,064
Hundreds more came to visit.

1610
01:25:13,195 --> 01:25:15,501
Educators, celebrities,
theologians, politicians,

1611
01:25:15,632 --> 01:25:16,372
friends.

1612
01:25:16,502 --> 01:25:18,939
So many friends.

1613
01:25:19,070 --> 01:25:20,767
So many.

1614
01:25:44,487 --> 01:25:51,842
Coretta died nine years
later of ovarian cancer.

1615
01:25:51,972 --> 01:25:57,369
Betty and Coretta, they
embodied a spirit of service

1616
01:25:57,500 --> 01:26:00,372
and a dedication to the
memories of their husbands

1617
01:26:00,503 --> 01:26:04,637
so that their struggles
wouldn't die with them.

1618
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:07,510
They faced tragedy,
but they refused

1619
01:26:07,640 --> 01:26:12,297
to let tragedy defeat them.

1620
01:26:12,428 --> 01:26:15,822
Instead, they fought
on for their children

1621
01:26:15,953 --> 01:26:21,872
and for the future,
for all of us.

1622
01:26:22,002 --> 01:26:28,879
Betty and Coretta, not
such opposites after all.

1623
01:26:29,009 --> 01:26:30,009
No.
