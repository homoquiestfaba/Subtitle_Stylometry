1
00:00:21,335 --> 00:00:24,862
( cooing)

2
00:00:43,123 --> 00:00:48,584
-- Ave Maria,
piena di grazia, eletta --

3
00:00:48,662 --> 00:00:52,598
-- Fra le spose
e le vergini sei tu --

4
00:00:52,666 --> 00:00:59,003
-- Sia benedetto il frutto,
o benedetta, --

5
00:00:59,072 --> 00:01:06,171
-- Di tue materne viscere,
Gesú. --

6
00:01:12,452 --> 00:01:15,182
Man: All my life,
I always wanted to fly.

7
00:01:16,289 --> 00:01:18,917
I always wanted
to live like a hawk.

8
00:01:20,327 --> 00:01:23,888
I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...

9
00:01:23,964 --> 00:01:25,932
to take flight,

10
00:01:25,999 --> 00:01:29,332
to soar above
everything and everyone,

11
00:01:30,704 --> 00:01:32,797
now that's living.

12
00:01:37,177 --> 00:01:39,270
( crowd cheering )

13
00:01:39,346 --> 00:01:41,007
( hip hop music playing )

14
00:01:45,452 --> 00:01:47,010
Man #2: Now listen, lads.
Listen up!

15
00:01:47,120 --> 00:01:48,849
They are not
going to foul.

16
00:01:48,955 --> 00:01:51,355
I know that son of a bitch,
and he plays conservative.

17
00:01:51,425 --> 00:01:53,723
So, we'll burn
15 seconds off the clock,

18
00:01:53,794 --> 00:01:55,921
and we'll end this thing
our way in his house.

19
00:01:55,996 --> 00:01:59,056
We stack it up. I want Odin, Michael
and Billy to handle the ball.

20
00:01:59,132 --> 00:02:01,191
Hugo, you and Todd
set up the screens.

21
00:02:01,268 --> 00:02:04,260
At 13 seconds, we run
the Tulsa play for Odin. Give me that.

22
00:02:04,337 --> 00:02:07,500
Todd, you're in the stack
with Michael. Hugo-- Hugo!

23
00:02:07,574 --> 00:02:10,941
You're at the right elbow. Billy, you're
at the low block on the weak side.

24
00:02:11,011 --> 00:02:14,412
And remember, lads.
Hugo and Todd are decoys.

25
00:02:14,481 --> 00:02:17,882
Decoys! I don't want to see either
one of those guys with the ball.

26
00:02:17,984 --> 00:02:21,385
At 13 seconds, we free up Odin
for the one on one, then clear!

27
00:02:21,455 --> 00:02:23,787
If it's not Odin, Michael.

28
00:02:23,857 --> 00:02:26,223
Put them in.
What time is it, team?

29
00:02:26,293 --> 00:02:27,282
Game time! Rah!

30
00:02:27,394 --> 00:02:28,622
All right, let's focus!

31
00:02:38,305 --> 00:02:40,273
( whistling )

32
00:02:43,276 --> 00:02:44,436
Move, move!

33
00:02:46,313 --> 00:02:48,713
Coach: Good passes.
I want good passes!

34
00:02:50,250 --> 00:02:51,547
Coach: Keep it tight.

35
00:02:54,387 --> 00:02:55,684
Tight!

36
00:02:59,593 --> 00:03:01,720
Players: Go, go, go!

37
00:03:01,795 --> 00:03:03,285
Take the ball!

38
00:03:06,333 --> 00:03:09,029
- Coach: Tulsa!
- Odin: Tulsa!

39
00:03:12,873 --> 00:03:14,465
Don't stop! Don't stop!

40
00:03:14,541 --> 00:03:15,974
Don't stop!

41
00:03:16,042 --> 00:03:22,845
Crowd: Eight, seven, six,
five, four, three, two, one--

42
00:03:22,916 --> 00:03:24,247
( crowd cheering )

43
00:03:24,351 --> 00:03:27,013
- ( timer sounding )
- Yes! Yes! Yes!

44
00:04:19,973 --> 00:04:22,168
( birds chirping )

45
00:04:34,988 --> 00:04:38,549
- Man #3: Coach Duke Goulding!
- ( clapping and cheering )

46
00:04:40,527 --> 00:04:43,018
Duke:
Thank you. Thank you.

47
00:04:43,096 --> 00:04:44,996
Thank you very much.

48
00:04:45,065 --> 00:04:46,726
All right.

49
00:04:46,800 --> 00:04:48,700
Odin, would you
come down here, please?

50
00:04:48,768 --> 00:04:51,328
Duke: As you all know,
I am a man of few words.

51
00:04:51,404 --> 00:04:54,202
Except for when one of us
is late for practice, right, Pop?

52
00:04:54,274 --> 00:04:56,504
I'll pretend I don't know
who said that, Hugo.

53
00:04:56,576 --> 00:04:58,066
I'll get right to the point.

54
00:04:58,144 --> 00:05:01,011
By virtue of having won
our divisional championship,

55
00:05:01,081 --> 00:05:03,447
as well as having the best
record in the league,

56
00:05:03,516 --> 00:05:06,815
we will have home court advantage
in the State Championship,

57
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:10,014
all the way up to, and
including, the semi-finals.

58
00:05:10,123 --> 00:05:14,856
And one reason for that is
this young man standing next to me.

59
00:05:14,928 --> 00:05:16,793
And I'll tell you
something else too--

60
00:05:18,264 --> 00:05:20,732
and I'm very proud
to say this publicly.

61
00:05:21,868 --> 00:05:24,496
I love him
like my own son.

62
00:05:26,740 --> 00:05:29,174
( crowd cheering )

63
00:05:29,242 --> 00:05:31,472
Duke:
Not only is he a shoe-in

64
00:05:31,544 --> 00:05:34,172
for this year's USA Today
high school All American,

65
00:05:34,247 --> 00:05:36,977
but he is going
to lead this team

66
00:05:37,050 --> 00:05:44,513
to the 20th State Championship in the
115 year history of this institution!

67
00:05:47,827 --> 00:05:49,454
You can stay on your feet,

68
00:05:49,529 --> 00:05:52,726
'cause at this time,
I am very proud to present

69
00:05:52,799 --> 00:05:55,029
this year's
unanimous choice

70
00:05:55,101 --> 00:05:59,231
for most valuable player
to Mr. Odin James.

71
00:05:59,305 --> 00:06:00,863
- Congratulations.
- ( crowd cheering )

72
00:06:06,346 --> 00:06:08,337
You know, at the beginning
of the season,

73
00:06:08,415 --> 00:06:10,576
we decided
to go all the way.

74
00:06:10,650 --> 00:06:13,016
And I did give it
all I had,

75
00:06:13,119 --> 00:06:17,385
but that wouldn't have meant nothing
if I didn't have a go-to guy.

76
00:06:17,457 --> 00:06:20,085
Odin: Big Mike,
come up here, man.

77
00:06:20,160 --> 00:06:24,324
Odin: Come on, now's not
the time to be shy. Come on.

78
00:06:25,965 --> 00:06:29,594
Odin: I told the coach
I wasn't accepting the MVP award

79
00:06:29,669 --> 00:06:33,196
unless the "man with the
hands" could share it with me.

80
00:06:33,273 --> 00:06:34,934
That's for you, baby.

81
00:06:35,909 --> 00:06:37,968
Odin: It's all you, baby.

82
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,918
( hip hop music playing )

83
00:06:46,553 --> 00:06:47,918
-- When they let me
in a club --

84
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:51,616
-- Assassins get VIP passes,
sipping on the passion --

85
00:06:53,993 --> 00:06:56,723
-- Come on in, your big brother
in the back, slipping in --

86
00:07:02,135 --> 00:07:04,831
-- Young thugs always got
a way to bum a scheme --

87
00:07:04,904 --> 00:07:07,270
-- When we show up, we be wearing
what the ballers wear --

88
00:07:07,340 --> 00:07:10,104
-- Me ace be macking,
the ice might stay cracking --

89
00:07:10,176 --> 00:07:12,804
-- On video, she always smackin'
the homies left --

90
00:07:12,879 --> 00:07:15,677
-- That was around 10:30
and he should be back --

91
00:07:15,749 --> 00:07:17,649
-- Females
get it free early --

92
00:07:17,751 --> 00:07:20,185
-- Be getting buzzed at the spot,
came blazed in the club --

93
00:07:20,253 --> 00:07:22,221
-- They had no police
raiding the club --

94
00:07:22,322 --> 00:07:24,722
-- You might see slow nigga
at your local club --

95
00:07:24,791 --> 00:07:27,191
-- Posted and toasted,
looking for some love --

96
00:07:27,260 --> 00:07:29,694
-- But the bartenders,
they usually ignore me --

97
00:07:29,763 --> 00:07:32,288
-- For my O.G.'s buy
my liquor for me. --

98
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:36,224
I don't understand.

99
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,328
Are you going to get
Desi and I together?

100
00:07:39,405 --> 00:07:42,431
- She's with him.
- Hugo: They're breaking up.

101
00:07:42,509 --> 00:07:45,967
When people are breaking up,
they don't grind.

102
00:07:46,045 --> 00:07:47,706
Those two
are definitely grinding.

103
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:49,180
Hugo:
We're going to break them up.

104
00:07:50,950 --> 00:07:52,713
I thought
you were his friend.

105
00:07:52,819 --> 00:07:54,787
You hang out
with him all the time.

106
00:07:54,854 --> 00:07:56,719
Hugo: And that's perfect,
'cause if we're going to do this,

107
00:07:56,790 --> 00:07:59,020
I've got to act like
I'm cool with him anyway.

108
00:07:59,092 --> 00:08:02,550
Look, you know
what a utility man is?

109
00:08:02,629 --> 00:08:03,857
A what?

110
00:08:04,931 --> 00:08:07,058
I'm considered
a utility man.

111
00:08:07,133 --> 00:08:10,762
I rebound, I can shoot.
I play guard, forward, power forward.

112
00:08:10,837 --> 00:08:13,101
You name the position,
I fucking play it.

113
00:08:15,108 --> 00:08:16,871
- What's your point?
- The point is,

114
00:08:16,943 --> 00:08:19,309
I'm the MVP
on this piece of shit team.

115
00:08:19,379 --> 00:08:22,780
I've been banging in the paint and
setting screens for the past four years,

116
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:26,216
and he chooses Michael.
Fucking sophomore! No way!

117
00:08:29,322 --> 00:08:30,812
Look at this shit.

118
00:08:34,794 --> 00:08:38,787
- Roger, don't wuss out on me now.
- He'll boot me out of school.

119
00:08:38,865 --> 00:08:42,460
We are two blocks away from
the Roger Calhoon Senior Library.

120
00:08:42,535 --> 00:08:44,867
Your father is
this fucking institution.

121
00:08:44,938 --> 00:08:46,667
Do you want Desi or not?

122
00:08:49,075 --> 00:08:51,373
( touchtone )

123
00:08:53,413 --> 00:08:55,438
( phone ringing )

124
00:08:58,818 --> 00:09:02,379
- Man: Yes?
- Uh, hi. Dean Brable?

125
00:09:02,488 --> 00:09:04,046
Man:
Yes. Who is this?

126
00:09:04,157 --> 00:09:06,284
I don't know
how to tell you this, sir,

127
00:09:06,359 --> 00:09:08,987
but someone sort of stole
something from you.

128
00:09:09,062 --> 00:09:11,257
Brable:
What are you talking about?

129
00:09:11,297 --> 00:09:12,594
Your daughter.

130
00:09:12,665 --> 00:09:15,634
What about my daughter?

131
00:09:15,702 --> 00:09:18,535
We're going to run them until
they drop dead or we drop dead!

132
00:09:18,605 --> 00:09:20,835
Duke: And that means
pressing on defense too.

133
00:09:20,907 --> 00:09:22,807
And by the way,
my friend, Hugo,

134
00:09:22,876 --> 00:09:24,707
your ass was dragging
in the fourth quarter.

135
00:09:24,777 --> 00:09:26,768
Either you get back
to your position on the traps,

136
00:09:26,846 --> 00:09:30,009
- or you give me some reason why.
- I'll be all right.

137
00:09:30,083 --> 00:09:32,779
You got to be better
than all right, son!

138
00:09:32,886 --> 00:09:34,979
Everybody
look at me, not him!

139
00:09:35,088 --> 00:09:37,852
This goes for you!
On your feet, gentlemen.

140
00:09:37,924 --> 00:09:40,222
Good afternoon, Dean.
You're welcome here.

141
00:09:40,293 --> 00:09:42,727
Good afternoon.

142
00:09:42,795 --> 00:09:45,593
And I have a witness who says
he forced himself on her.

143
00:09:45,665 --> 00:09:47,826
What? Who?

144
00:09:47,901 --> 00:09:52,668
Look, if Desi says that I did anything
even close to wrong to her,

145
00:09:52,739 --> 00:09:55,469
- I'll leave the goddamn school. OK?
- Take it easy, son.

146
00:09:55,541 --> 00:09:57,600
Bob, that's a very
serious allegation.

147
00:09:57,677 --> 00:10:00,840
- You say you have a witness?
- Come on, there's no witness.

148
00:10:00,914 --> 00:10:03,246
I would never do anything
like that. Ever.

149
00:10:03,316 --> 00:10:05,978
Brable: You're telling me you never
had any run-ins with the police?

150
00:10:06,085 --> 00:10:08,451
No, it means I didn't
force myself on Desi.

151
00:10:08,521 --> 00:10:11,046
That's not
what I just asked you.

152
00:10:11,157 --> 00:10:13,318
What are you trying to say?

153
00:10:13,393 --> 00:10:15,029
- You know what I'm saying.
- You're saying I'm not clean?

154
00:10:15,029 --> 00:10:16,556
Is that what you're sayin'?

155
00:10:16,629 --> 00:10:18,187
Cause I'm not
on that shit no more.

156
00:10:18,264 --> 00:10:19,663
Come on, coach,
you know this.

157
00:10:19,732 --> 00:10:22,257
I mean, test my ass.
Test me.

158
00:10:22,335 --> 00:10:24,394
This is fucked up.
This is fucked up.

159
00:10:24,470 --> 00:10:28,236
And a lot of the things I hear you say
about Desi are fucked up.

160
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,367
- Bob.
- Don't underestimate me, son.

161
00:10:30,443 --> 00:10:33,071
Don't underestimate me
when it comes to my daughter.

162
00:10:33,146 --> 00:10:36,912
Hey, Bob! Please, please!
Back off! Now, come on. Please.

163
00:10:36,983 --> 00:10:38,314
If you were
so worried about me,

164
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:41,080
how come this school
busted its ass to get me here?

165
00:10:41,187 --> 00:10:43,087
- Because you were worth it!
- ( knocking on door )

166
00:10:43,156 --> 00:10:44,123
Yes?

167
00:10:44,190 --> 00:10:46,158
Duke:
Come in, sweetheart.

168
00:10:46,259 --> 00:10:48,318
Please,
sit down over here.

169
00:10:48,394 --> 00:10:50,021
D, you've got to tell
these guys what's going on.

170
00:10:50,096 --> 00:10:53,588
- Brable: We know what's going on.
- Duke: We've got to be reasonable.

171
00:10:53,666 --> 00:10:54,564
Now, come on.

172
00:10:56,035 --> 00:10:57,332
Honey...

173
00:10:59,872 --> 00:11:02,670
we've never had
any secrets before, right?

174
00:11:02,742 --> 00:11:05,472
I just want you
to tell me the truth.

175
00:11:05,545 --> 00:11:07,843
Did Odin ever harm you,

176
00:11:07,914 --> 00:11:12,442
force you to do anything
that you didn't want to do?

177
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:14,042
Anything at all?

178
00:11:16,489 --> 00:11:19,652
Odin and I have been
together for four months.

179
00:11:19,726 --> 00:11:23,594
Brable: "Together"?
What does that mean, "together"?

180
00:11:23,663 --> 00:11:25,255
Dad, that's none
of your business.

181
00:11:25,331 --> 00:11:27,561
Brable:
I asked you a question.

182
00:11:28,668 --> 00:11:30,863
And I said
it's none of your business.

183
00:11:48,054 --> 00:11:50,887
Listen, Bob,
this is a family matter.

184
00:11:50,957 --> 00:11:53,619
Maybe we shouldn't be
discussing it here.

185
00:11:53,693 --> 00:11:56,526
I mean, he's a good kid.
Don't do this.

186
00:12:00,733 --> 00:12:02,098
Talk to him.

187
00:12:02,168 --> 00:12:04,136
Let's give him
a chance to talk.

188
00:12:04,203 --> 00:12:05,795
Outside.

189
00:12:12,045 --> 00:12:17,779
Sir, I just want to tell you that
you've got a great daughter there.

190
00:12:19,185 --> 00:12:22,154
And I really,
really care about her.

191
00:12:22,221 --> 00:12:27,352
You've got to understand
that what we have is beautiful.

192
00:12:30,063 --> 00:12:32,930
No. She deceived me.

193
00:12:34,333 --> 00:12:36,858
What makes you think
she won't do the same to you?

194
00:12:39,205 --> 00:12:40,934
( coughing )

195
00:12:42,008 --> 00:12:45,466
If you ever lie on me again, I'll fuck
your punk ass up a lot worse than this.

196
00:12:45,545 --> 00:12:48,105
You understand me, Rog? Huh?

197
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:54,419
Odin:
See you at dinner.

198
00:12:58,925 --> 00:13:01,416
( hip hop music playing )

199
00:13:24,817 --> 00:13:27,945
Man: You're going to keep doing
this shit all year, yo?

200
00:13:28,054 --> 00:13:30,386
You tell me, man.
You're the pharmacist.

201
00:13:32,325 --> 00:13:36,853
You know, some of these drugs I sell
will guarantee to have you twisted up.

202
00:13:36,929 --> 00:13:40,729
This steroid,
50-50 chance.

203
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,665
I put three inches
on my vertical this month.

204
00:13:42,735 --> 00:13:45,260
I took half a second
off my 40, bro'.

205
00:13:46,439 --> 00:13:47,599
It's doing the job.

206
00:13:47,673 --> 00:13:51,200
When you start playing for North
Carolina, don't forget about me.

207
00:13:51,277 --> 00:13:53,142
Shoot the nigger
some tickets.

208
00:13:53,212 --> 00:13:55,203
I'm talking about court side.

209
00:14:05,725 --> 00:14:08,285
Man: we're going to cycle you
to something else next week.

210
00:14:08,361 --> 00:14:10,124
You've been drinking
enough water?

211
00:14:10,196 --> 00:14:12,426
By the gallon, man.

212
00:14:12,498 --> 00:14:16,525
I'm surprised it doesn't come out
these holes you keep sticking in me.

213
00:14:16,602 --> 00:14:19,662
Man: I know you're all into
this basketball stuff,

214
00:14:19,739 --> 00:14:22,264
but if it don't work,
don't trip.

215
00:14:22,341 --> 00:14:25,742
I'm saying cause there's some things
in life we weren't meant to have.

216
00:14:25,811 --> 00:14:28,837
I mean, don't go out there making
yourself all crazy and shit.

217
00:14:28,915 --> 00:14:32,749
How can I go crazy when I've got
you selling me dream in a bottle, man?

218
00:14:36,255 --> 00:14:37,722
So, have you talked
to him about it?

219
00:14:37,823 --> 00:14:39,688
Woman:
There's nothing to talk about.

220
00:14:39,759 --> 00:14:41,750
I do everything for him,

221
00:14:41,861 --> 00:14:44,591
but he's been acting
completely weird lately.

222
00:14:44,664 --> 00:14:46,689
Desi:
Lately? Try always.

223
00:14:46,766 --> 00:14:48,734
Desi: Sorry.

224
00:14:48,801 --> 00:14:50,496
What's the deal?

225
00:14:50,570 --> 00:14:53,232
Everyone at school
likes Hugo, except you.

226
00:14:53,306 --> 00:14:54,796
Nobody doesn't like him.

227
00:14:54,874 --> 00:14:57,399
I don't trust anyone who doesn't
have at least one enemy.

228
00:14:57,476 --> 00:14:59,273
Woman:
Well, I guess he does.

229
00:14:59,345 --> 00:15:00,744
Desi: I didn't think
you were going to make it.

230
00:15:00,813 --> 00:15:02,337
Oh, come on now.

231
00:15:03,549 --> 00:15:05,540
You know I can't beat
Magnolia tomorrow

232
00:15:05,651 --> 00:15:07,778
without seeing
my good luck charm first.

233
00:15:07,887 --> 00:15:10,287
- What's up, Em?
- Hey.

234
00:15:10,356 --> 00:15:12,324
Hey, I've got
something for you.

235
00:15:22,301 --> 00:15:23,859
It's over 100 years old.

236
00:15:23,936 --> 00:15:26,496
It's over your price
range is what it is.

237
00:15:26,572 --> 00:15:30,736
It was my great-grandmother's and
it's always been in my family.

238
00:15:30,810 --> 00:15:33,711
It's supposed
to stay that way, but...

239
00:15:33,779 --> 00:15:36,179
I feel like
we're already family.

240
00:15:37,250 --> 00:15:39,275
Yo, Em, don't think
I forgot you.

241
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:41,216
I got the new Harlem's
Finest for you, baby.

242
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,151
Odin:
Enjoy that, all right?

243
00:16:03,175 --> 00:16:05,200
Come on, Emily's here.

244
00:16:05,278 --> 00:16:08,213
Odin: I know.
We're not going to do anything.

245
00:16:08,281 --> 00:16:11,478
I just like feeling
your skin next to mine, okay?

246
00:16:11,584 --> 00:16:13,176
Come on.

247
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:29,067
My father's a smart man. But he's
never actually been through anything.

248
00:16:32,104 --> 00:16:36,234
He acts like he's in control all
the time, but really he's just scared.

249
00:16:36,309 --> 00:16:38,368
Desi:
You never seem scared to me.

250
00:16:38,444 --> 00:16:41,242
Are you asking me how
I got that scar on my back?

251
00:16:42,315 --> 00:16:44,340
You do have
the best stories.

252
00:16:46,519 --> 00:16:49,488
I was a C-section baby
and they cut too far.

253
00:16:49,588 --> 00:16:53,115
My mom couldn't afford
a good doctor.

254
00:16:54,727 --> 00:16:56,160
Are you serious?

255
00:16:56,228 --> 00:16:58,321
I fell off my skateboard.

256
00:16:59,699 --> 00:17:01,633
Are you crazy?
I get scared all the time.

257
00:17:01,701 --> 00:17:03,225
- You do not.
- Yes, I do.

258
00:17:03,302 --> 00:17:04,234
When?

259
00:17:05,438 --> 00:17:07,235
When?

260
00:17:07,306 --> 00:17:08,933
Okay.

261
00:17:09,008 --> 00:17:11,704
The first time
I tried to talk to you,

262
00:17:11,777 --> 00:17:14,371
I thought I was going
to faint, or something.

263
00:17:14,447 --> 00:17:15,641
That's not true.

264
00:17:15,715 --> 00:17:18,445
The second sentence out of your mouth
was, "Do you still have a boyfriend?"

265
00:17:18,551 --> 00:17:20,212
I said I was scared.

266
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,617
I never said I couldn't
handle the pressure.

267
00:17:22,688 --> 00:17:25,384
You know I've got
them player skills.

268
00:17:25,458 --> 00:17:27,892
Oh, Ladies and Gentlemen
he's getting a little cocky.

269
00:17:27,960 --> 00:17:30,986
Don't say "Iittle" and "cocky" in
the same sentence when it comes to me.

270
00:17:31,063 --> 00:17:33,497
Especially
when you know the deal.

271
00:17:33,566 --> 00:17:35,033
Shut up!

272
00:17:36,702 --> 00:17:40,069
No, but you really
think I'm too cocky?

273
00:17:40,139 --> 00:17:42,232
No, it's okay.
You should be.

274
00:17:42,308 --> 00:17:45,402
- You pulled me, didn't you?
- Yes, I did.

275
00:17:45,478 --> 00:17:47,673
Yes, indeed, I did.

276
00:17:49,014 --> 00:17:50,606
I don't know how,
but you did it.

277
00:17:50,683 --> 00:17:52,344
What do you mean,
you don't know how?

278
00:17:52,451 --> 00:17:54,715
I pulled you 'cause
I'm that kind of nigger.

279
00:17:56,122 --> 00:17:59,558
Uh-oh. Don't be
acting like that.

280
00:17:59,625 --> 00:18:01,991
See, I can say "nigger"
cause I am a nigger.

281
00:18:02,061 --> 00:18:04,825
You can't 'cause you ain't.
Don't be jealous.

282
00:18:04,897 --> 00:18:08,060
And why can't I say it?
My people invented the word.

283
00:18:08,134 --> 00:18:09,601
You can't even think it.

284
00:18:09,668 --> 00:18:11,260
You're the one
who started it.

285
00:18:11,337 --> 00:18:13,532
You said I was so fine
you'd let me dress you up

286
00:18:13,606 --> 00:18:16,131
and play Black Buck
Got Loose in the Big House.

287
00:18:16,208 --> 00:18:17,675
Don't go repeating
that, all right?

288
00:18:17,743 --> 00:18:19,973
If another Black person
knew I said that,

289
00:18:20,045 --> 00:18:21,979
I could get my
suffering-Negro-league card revoked.

290
00:18:26,952 --> 00:18:31,218
Then you'd better watch out, because
I've got some dirt on you, player.

291
00:18:31,290 --> 00:18:33,349
Got some dirt on me, huh?

292
00:18:33,459 --> 00:18:35,051
You better not
let that leak.

293
00:18:35,127 --> 00:18:36,594
( both laughing )

294
00:18:36,662 --> 00:18:40,894

-- What is the Black star? --

300
00:19:16,135 --> 00:19:18,660
-- Is it the cat
with the black shades, the black car? --

301
00:19:18,737 --> 00:19:21,262
-- Is it shining from very far
to where you are --

302
00:19:21,340 --> 00:19:23,103
-- It is commonplace
or different --

303
00:19:23,175 --> 00:19:25,370
-- Intimate and distant,
fresher than an infant --

304
00:19:25,444 --> 00:19:28,004
-- Black, my family thick
like they're striped molasses --

305
00:19:28,080 --> 00:19:30,605
-- Star on the rise
in the eyes of the masses --

306

-- Black is the color
of my true love's hair --

307
00:19:33,419 --> 00:19:35,546
-- Stars are bright shining,
hot balls of air --

308
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:37,519
-- Black like my baby girl's stare --

309
00:19:37,590 --> 00:19:40,081
-- Black like the velvet
that the muslim wear --

310
00:19:40,192 --> 00:19:42,990
-- Black like the planet
that they fear, why they scared? --

311
00:19:43,062 --> 00:19:45,223
-- Black like a slave ship
that later brought us here --

312
00:19:45,297 --> 00:19:47,561
-- Black like the cheeks
that are roadways for tears --

313
00:19:47,633 --> 00:19:50,329
-- That leaved Black faces
well traveled with years --

314

-- Blacker than
my granddaddy armchair --

316
00:19:54,540 --> 00:19:56,872
-- He never really got
no time to chill there --

317
00:19:56,942 --> 00:19:58,603
-- 'Cause this life
is warfare, warfare --

318
00:19:58,677 --> 00:20:01,145
-- Deep on the front lines,
and Blacks is all there --

319
00:20:01,213 --> 00:20:03,477
-- Black like the perception
of who on welfare --

320
00:20:03,549 --> 00:20:05,540
-- Black like faces
at the bottom of the well, --

321
00:20:05,651 --> 00:20:07,312
-- I've been there
before to bring the light --

322

Injured on the floor.

00:20:39,652 --> 00:20:43,588
Palmetto Grove's
number four, Odin James.

337
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:54,763
- Is he okay?
- They're doing a CAT scan right now,

338
00:20:54,833 --> 00:20:57,529
so we'll see.
Don't worry.

339
00:20:57,603 --> 00:20:59,298
Duke: Edmund, did you bring
the insurance card?

340
00:20:59,371 --> 00:21:00,895
- Ed: I've got the card.
- Duke: So we're covered?

341
00:21:03,676 --> 00:21:06,736
Mickey gets more kisses
from my girl than I do.

342
00:21:06,812 --> 00:21:09,337
Could you stop being
a sarcastic asshole just once?

343
00:21:09,415 --> 00:21:13,146
Hugo: I was joking,
all right? Relax.

344
00:21:13,252 --> 00:21:15,982
Odin: What's the deal?
I'm gone for a couple of hours

345
00:21:16,088 --> 00:21:17,612
and you're already
taking my girl, Big Mike?

346
00:21:20,059 --> 00:21:22,789
- Odin: What's up, dude?
- You get right home and get some rest.

347
00:21:22,861 --> 00:21:25,125
Odin: I will, man.
What's up, baby?

348
00:21:28,200 --> 00:21:29,792
I was worried about you.

349
00:21:29,868 --> 00:21:31,699
You were the one
who got hurt, stupid.

350
00:21:31,770 --> 00:21:33,738
No, you don't understand.

351
00:21:33,806 --> 00:21:35,899
I was worried that
if I hurt myself,

352
00:21:35,975 --> 00:21:38,409
who was going to take care
of you over there at Duke?

353
00:21:38,477 --> 00:21:40,001
Desi:
Oh, right, right.

354
00:21:40,079 --> 00:21:42,047
You're still going to play
"Big House" with me, though, right?

355
00:21:42,114 --> 00:21:44,582
Hey, stop it with that.

356
00:21:44,650 --> 00:21:47,141
Then you better
stop getting hurt.

357
00:21:47,252 --> 00:21:50,153
- I love you.
- I love you too.

358
00:21:50,222 --> 00:21:53,191
Duke: You kids need to get back
to the dorms. Let's go, Hugo.

359
00:21:53,258 --> 00:21:55,317
I'm going to give
a shout at the boys, all right?

360
00:21:55,394 --> 00:21:57,089
- Mike.
- Hey, man.

361
00:21:57,162 --> 00:22:00,131
- We did our thing today, bro'.
- Yeah, we did good.

362
00:22:01,467 --> 00:22:03,435
What's up, Em?
How are you doing?

363
00:22:03,502 --> 00:22:05,060
Hugo.

364
00:22:05,137 --> 00:22:07,662
Hugo: Thought we lost you
there for a second, bro.

365
00:22:07,740 --> 00:22:10,402
I ain't going nowhere.
But did we take it to them or what?

366
00:22:10,476 --> 00:22:13,240
You took it to them by yourself.
You know that, player.

367
00:22:13,312 --> 00:22:15,177
You're coming to
that party off campus?

368
00:22:15,247 --> 00:22:17,647
Yeah, I need to get a ride
with my dad, though.

369
00:22:17,716 --> 00:22:19,707
All right, man.
Don't take too long.

370
00:22:19,818 --> 00:22:21,115
Later, Hugo.

371
00:22:23,722 --> 00:22:25,986
Come on, don't worry.
He'll get there.

372
00:22:27,459 --> 00:22:29,552
Yeah, Roger.

373
00:22:29,628 --> 00:22:31,687
We've got
plans tonight, man.

374
00:22:36,802 --> 00:22:40,101
( hip hop music playing )

375
00:22:42,307 --> 00:22:45,299
When I passed out,
I think I had a vision.

376
00:22:47,212 --> 00:22:51,706
Have you ever ridden on the handlebars
on one of your friends' bikes before?

377
00:22:51,817 --> 00:22:53,284
Yeah.

378
00:22:53,352 --> 00:22:56,788
Well, I used to ride on the bars
and try to close my eyes.

379
00:22:56,855 --> 00:22:58,982
I could never do it.

380
00:22:59,091 --> 00:23:00,456
It's some scary shit,
cause you've got...

381
00:23:00,526 --> 00:23:04,792
to try to trust
the other person not to crash.

382
00:23:04,863 --> 00:23:07,058
You're tripping me out
right now.

383
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,692
I feel like I can
close my eyes with you.

384
00:23:11,770 --> 00:23:12,964
Look...

385
00:23:13,038 --> 00:23:15,802
we're 18,
and personally,

386
00:23:15,874 --> 00:23:20,504
I'm not trying to get married by some
Elvis impersonator in Vegas, but...

387
00:23:24,349 --> 00:23:26,943
I figured maybe we could pretend
for a while, you know?

388
00:23:33,659 --> 00:23:36,025
That is the sweetest thing
I've ever heard.

389
00:23:45,104 --> 00:23:46,469
Oh, yeah!

390
00:23:46,538 --> 00:23:48,665
Now we're feeling good,
huh?

391
00:23:48,741 --> 00:23:50,538
Go get them, tiger.

392
00:23:50,609 --> 00:23:53,271
Now go out there and
you find that girl.

393
00:23:55,414 --> 00:23:57,348
- Time to pull some weeds.
- Just for the record,...

394
00:23:57,416 --> 00:23:59,145
why am I
doing this again?

395
00:23:59,251 --> 00:24:02,550
Hugo: Because this is
how you get Desi's attention.

396
00:24:02,621 --> 00:24:04,646
Now get your honky
ass in gear.

397
00:24:07,292 --> 00:24:08,259
Mike:
It's about team work.

398
00:24:08,327 --> 00:24:10,090
Hey.

399
00:24:10,162 --> 00:24:12,790
- Excuse us, Roger.
- Excuse you?

400
00:24:12,865 --> 00:24:14,264
We're talking.

401
00:24:14,333 --> 00:24:17,769
What, are you diagramming
some basketball plays?

402
00:24:17,836 --> 00:24:19,463
What did you say?

403
00:24:24,343 --> 00:24:27,540
I don't care if your father
owns the whole fucking school.

404
00:24:34,019 --> 00:24:36,510
Shit. Excuse me.

405
00:24:39,091 --> 00:24:42,151
Roger!
Take it easy, big guy.

406
00:24:42,227 --> 00:24:44,457
- Not so tough, now, are you?
- Hey, Rog!

407
00:24:44,530 --> 00:24:46,521
What are you talking about?
Stop it!

408
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:48,759
Your shooting ability
isn't helping you now, is it?

409
00:24:48,834 --> 00:24:50,131
Hugo: Take it easy, pal.

410
00:24:51,336 --> 00:24:53,395
Hugo: Back it off.

411
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:55,099
Odin:
Stop it, man. Come on.

412
00:24:55,174 --> 00:24:56,198
That's enough.

413
00:24:56,275 --> 00:24:58,709
Desi: Oh my God, Roger.
You're bleeding.

414
00:24:59,778 --> 00:25:01,143
Shit.

415
00:25:05,784 --> 00:25:08,150
So, this lad loses
a pint of blood,

416
00:25:08,220 --> 00:25:10,814
and you guys have got nothing
to say for yourselves.

417
00:25:10,923 --> 00:25:13,289
It was an accident, Pop.

418
00:25:13,358 --> 00:25:15,553
Roger's been
starting crap all year.

419
00:25:15,627 --> 00:25:17,720
Duke: Who threw
the first punch, Michael?

420
00:25:19,898 --> 00:25:22,298
Duke: Hugo, did Michael
throw the first punch?

421
00:25:22,367 --> 00:25:24,460
Answer me,
yes or no?!

422
00:25:24,536 --> 00:25:28,472
Yeah, Dad. Michael threw the first
punch but it wasn't his fault.

423
00:25:28,540 --> 00:25:31,839
All right? He just had a few
too many beers. That's all.

424
00:25:31,910 --> 00:25:33,138
I didn't hear that.

425
00:25:34,580 --> 00:25:36,673
I did not hear that.
You understand?

426
00:25:42,321 --> 00:25:44,789
You have disgraced our team.

427
00:25:44,857 --> 00:25:46,916
You know the rules.

428
00:25:47,025 --> 00:25:49,357
You can attend practice.

429
00:25:49,428 --> 00:25:51,862
That's a privilege
that I give you.

430
00:25:51,930 --> 00:25:55,229
Duke: But you will not play
in at least two games.

431
00:25:55,300 --> 00:25:57,768
Then, we will see.

432
00:25:57,836 --> 00:26:00,361
You know what this is going
to cost us?

433
00:26:00,439 --> 00:26:02,805
This young man sitting here...

434
00:26:02,875 --> 00:26:10,111
called you up to share
the Most Valuable Player Award,

435
00:26:10,182 --> 00:26:14,846
and you just shit
all over it.

436
00:26:14,953 --> 00:26:18,821
And you know, you're lucky
that this didn't happen on campus,

437
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:21,689
because
your over-privileged ass--

438
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:22,954
I know, sir.

439
00:26:24,897 --> 00:26:26,387
Get out of here.

440
00:26:28,300 --> 00:26:29,995
Duke: Get out of here,
all of you.

441
00:26:41,980 --> 00:26:45,609
Is there some reason you're
still in this office, son?

442
00:26:45,717 --> 00:26:46,945
Hugo: No, Pop.

443
00:26:58,897 --> 00:27:01,263
Odin:
You fucked us up, Dogs.

444
00:27:01,333 --> 00:27:03,494
Odin: Fucked up.

445
00:27:31,263 --> 00:27:35,199
If Odin had got into a fight,
would you have sat him too?

446
00:27:39,404 --> 00:27:41,736
I'm eating now.

447
00:27:56,722 --> 00:27:58,519
I'm going back
to the dorm, Mom.

448
00:28:01,727 --> 00:28:04,355
Hugo: So what did Roger
say to you anyway?

449
00:28:04,429 --> 00:28:06,897
I'd feel guilty
kicking his ass.

450
00:28:06,965 --> 00:28:08,933
Mike: Save it, Hugo.

451
00:28:09,001 --> 00:28:11,435
Hugo: You'll be back on the team
next year. So, who cares?

452
00:28:11,503 --> 00:28:14,734
Mike: Dude, it's different
for you, cause your dad is cool.

453
00:28:14,806 --> 00:28:16,967
But my parents
are going to find out.

454
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:21,703
Why are you in school, man?

455
00:28:24,149 --> 00:28:25,309
What?

456
00:28:27,019 --> 00:28:29,510
Are you here for
your parents or for you?

457
00:28:31,256 --> 00:28:33,724
So they'll be a little pissed off.
What are they going to do?

458
00:28:33,792 --> 00:28:35,760
- Are they going to spank you?
- Hugo,

459
00:28:35,827 --> 00:28:39,194
my parents always talk
about reputation.

460
00:28:39,264 --> 00:28:42,631
Reputation?
Who gives a fuck about reputation?

461
00:28:42,701 --> 00:28:46,137
I love you, man, but you're
a little bit of a mamma's boy.

462
00:28:46,204 --> 00:28:49,196
The only person you have to
answer to is yourself.

463
00:28:49,274 --> 00:28:51,469
You make your own rules.

464
00:28:52,544 --> 00:28:55,012
The minute you figure
that out, you're free.

465
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:57,014
( bell ringing )

466
00:28:59,451 --> 00:29:00,975
Look, Mike,

467
00:29:02,054 --> 00:29:04,522
you really want
back on the team?

468
00:29:04,589 --> 00:29:07,080
Why can't you just talk
to your dad?

469
00:29:07,192 --> 00:29:11,288
Because I'm telling you,
my dad trusts Odin, all right?

470
00:29:11,363 --> 00:29:14,355
If Odin says we need you back in there,
you're back in there.

471
00:29:14,433 --> 00:29:17,266
Yeah, but Odin won't
even talk to me, man.

472
00:29:17,335 --> 00:29:18,563
Mike,

473
00:29:19,704 --> 00:29:21,228
am I your boy?

474
00:29:22,774 --> 00:29:24,503
Am I your boy?

475
00:29:25,043 --> 00:29:26,567
Hugo:
All right, then.

476
00:29:26,645 --> 00:29:28,442
This is what
we've got to do.

477
00:29:28,513 --> 00:29:30,640
You're friends
with Desi, right?

478
00:29:30,715 --> 00:29:31,875
Yes, of course.

479
00:29:31,950 --> 00:29:33,815
Well, now you're
her best friend.

480
00:29:33,919 --> 00:29:36,410
And you're going to get her
to talk to Odin for you.

481
00:29:36,521 --> 00:29:38,386
Pour your heart out to her.

482
00:29:38,457 --> 00:29:41,085
Girls are suckers for guys
who pour their hearts out.

483
00:29:41,159 --> 00:29:43,093
And then she talks to Odin.

484
00:29:43,161 --> 00:29:44,628
But listen to me.

485
00:29:44,696 --> 00:29:48,154
You've got to hang with her.
That's the only way this thing works.

486
00:29:48,233 --> 00:29:49,996
It's worth a shot, bro'.

487
00:29:53,038 --> 00:29:55,905
Yo. Hugo, thanks, man.

488
00:29:56,975 --> 00:29:58,704
Roger: What are you doing
with this stupid bird?

489
00:29:58,777 --> 00:30:01,211
- People are looking for it.
- Hugo: I borrowed it.

490
00:30:01,279 --> 00:30:02,940
Roger:
We've got things to do,

491
00:30:03,014 --> 00:30:05,073
and you're playing pranks
with the fricking mascot?

492
00:30:05,150 --> 00:30:07,243
Roger: I can't stop
thinking about her.

493
00:30:07,352 --> 00:30:10,082
Why don't you rich shitheads
ever have any patience?

494
00:30:10,188 --> 00:30:14,557
Anything worth anything
takes time and sacrifice.

495
00:30:14,626 --> 00:30:16,617
You spoiled fuck.

496
00:30:17,829 --> 00:30:19,319
What do you call this?

497
00:30:19,397 --> 00:30:21,262
You did get your ass kicked
pretty good, though.

498
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:24,063
Roger: No, I got my ass
kicked pretty good twice,

499
00:30:24,136 --> 00:30:26,070
in less than a week!

500
00:30:26,138 --> 00:30:28,538
I need to know
where this is going!

501
00:30:28,607 --> 00:30:32,600
Announcer: Friends, this tournament
has seen some excellent play,

502
00:30:32,677 --> 00:30:36,135
but nothing better than
Odin James of Palmetto Grove.

503
00:30:36,214 --> 00:30:38,682
Announcer:
Tonight, James and his Hawks

504
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,548
face the mighty Bulldogs
of North Charleston,

505
00:30:41,653 --> 00:30:47,421
in the first face-off between these
two hoops powerhouses in nine years.

506
00:30:47,492 --> 00:30:50,859
The Hawks, now an amazing ninth
in the nation in prep ball

507
00:30:50,929 --> 00:30:54,888
are just two games away
from the State Championship,

508
00:30:54,966 --> 00:30:58,060
but they'll have to do it
without their team mascot.

509
00:30:58,136 --> 00:31:01,128
Evidently,
the bird was stolen.

510
00:31:01,206 --> 00:31:04,573
So it looks like James will have
to do all the flying himself.

511
00:31:06,912 --> 00:31:09,540
Duke: Watch the hands!
Watch the hands, ref!

512
00:31:09,614 --> 00:31:11,206
He's open!

513
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:14,275
He's open, Hugo!
Give him the ball!

514
00:31:14,352 --> 00:31:16,217
Push, push, push!

515
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:28,924
Pressure the ball!
Pressure the ball!

516
00:31:29,000 --> 00:31:30,763
Todd, get back!

517
00:31:35,740 --> 00:31:37,264
Todd,
stay with the ball!

518
00:31:41,313 --> 00:31:43,941
Duke: Put a body on him,
for Christ's sake!

519
00:31:45,951 --> 00:31:48,010
Duke: Play the man,
not the ball!

520
00:31:48,119 --> 00:31:49,882
Come on,
put a body on him!

521
00:31:49,988 --> 00:31:51,956
Come on,
he's slipping!

522
00:31:53,758 --> 00:31:55,123
Time!

523
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:58,128
Come on, let's go.
We've only got 20!

524
00:32:01,132 --> 00:32:03,464
Duke: Lads, you're getting
into the wrong guy's face.

525
00:32:03,535 --> 00:32:05,628
Number 45 is taking us
to the cleaners.

526
00:32:05,704 --> 00:32:07,103
Every time he gets
the ball, he's freed up.

527
00:32:07,172 --> 00:32:11,575
It's an automatic deuce because nobody
is putting a body on him in the paint.

528
00:32:11,643 --> 00:32:14,510
So put a man to man
with a floater.

529
00:32:14,579 --> 00:32:17,047
Odin, you're the floater.
Billy, look at me!

530
00:32:17,115 --> 00:32:19,948
You deny that son of a bitch
the ball, understand?

531
00:32:20,051 --> 00:32:21,678
And Odin,
if he gets away from Billy,

532
00:32:21,786 --> 00:32:23,413
I don't give a shit if
you have to pull his pisser,

533
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:25,887
his feet do not
leave the ground!

534
00:32:25,957 --> 00:32:27,584
Duke: Enough said?
All right, put them in.

535
00:32:27,659 --> 00:32:29,718
What time is it now?

536
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:32,422
- All: Game time! Rah!
- All right, let's play!

537
00:32:32,497 --> 00:32:35,489
Duke: Odin, Hugo,
come on! Wake up!

538
00:32:35,567 --> 00:32:36,932
Let's finish this thing.

539
00:32:38,003 --> 00:32:41,166
Give me another board.
Come on, let's go! Get it up!

540
00:32:41,239 --> 00:32:44,436
- Watch it!
- Duke: Watch him, Odin!

541
00:32:46,611 --> 00:32:49,512
Duke: Push him!
Come on, help him out!

542
00:32:49,581 --> 00:32:52,982
Watch the perimeter.
There you go. Take the shot.

543
00:32:57,122 --> 00:32:58,350
Yes!

544
00:32:58,456 --> 00:33:00,890
Duke: Hugo, stay on the elbow.
Stay on the elbow.

545
00:33:00,959 --> 00:33:02,824
Pop through, Billy.

546
00:33:04,963 --> 00:33:06,396
Pick it up!

547
00:33:25,650 --> 00:33:28,050
( timer sounding )

548
00:33:58,616 --> 00:34:02,712
Odin: Oh, Jesus.
Hey, man.

549
00:34:05,957 --> 00:34:07,982
You know,
I've been thinking, man.

550
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:11,153
I think I'm going to talk
to coach about Mikey.

551
00:34:11,229 --> 00:34:14,096
He should be a part
of all this, man.

552
00:34:14,165 --> 00:34:15,359
Listen,

553
00:34:16,434 --> 00:34:19,096
did Mike know that you and Desi
were getting together?

554
00:34:20,171 --> 00:34:21,604
Odin: Yeah, he knew.

555
00:34:23,408 --> 00:34:24,534
Why?

556
00:34:26,544 --> 00:34:28,375
I didn't think he knew.

557
00:34:28,446 --> 00:34:31,813
Odin: You know, Mikey's the one
that hooked us up, man.

558
00:34:34,853 --> 00:34:36,286
Do you trust Mike?

559
00:34:40,191 --> 00:34:42,421
I trust him out there
on that court.

560
00:34:42,494 --> 00:34:44,462
The man
can play some ball.

561
00:34:44,529 --> 00:34:45,996
Yeah,
but do you trust him?

562
00:34:47,665 --> 00:34:49,132
Odin: Yeah, he's cool.

563
00:34:54,072 --> 00:34:56,870
What's up, man?
Why are you tripping?

564
00:34:56,941 --> 00:34:58,875
It's nothing, man.

565
00:34:58,943 --> 00:35:02,276
Odin: Come on, Hugo.
Say what you've got to say.

566
00:35:02,347 --> 00:35:05,009
You're not
a jealous person, man.

567
00:35:05,083 --> 00:35:07,381
I am.
It's a weakness.

568
00:35:07,485 --> 00:35:10,750
You know, sometimes I see things
that are not really there.

569
00:35:10,822 --> 00:35:12,915
Odin: Yeah?

570
00:35:17,896 --> 00:35:20,364
You don't want to hear
what I have to say.

571
00:35:20,432 --> 00:35:22,593
Let me be
the judge of that.

572
00:35:28,006 --> 00:35:30,167
I can't help
but think that...

573
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,570
you should
watch your girl, bro'.

574
00:35:34,646 --> 00:35:38,343
I mean, she and Mike spend
an awful lot of time together.

575
00:35:38,416 --> 00:35:40,475
And so what?

576
00:35:40,585 --> 00:35:44,077
Hugo: All I'm saying is that
her and Mike are always together.

577
00:35:44,189 --> 00:35:47,090
And I know the Dean would rather
see Mike up in that piece.

578
00:35:47,158 --> 00:35:49,251
How can you say some shit
like that to me, man?

579
00:35:49,327 --> 00:35:50,794
See, you're right.

580
00:35:50,862 --> 00:35:52,955
I shouldn't
have said nothing.

581
00:35:54,299 --> 00:35:55,926
Forget about it, man.

582
00:35:56,000 --> 00:35:57,763
Mike's a good guy.

583
00:36:01,539 --> 00:36:03,097
Wait, wait.

584
00:36:04,843 --> 00:36:08,176
No, man, you can't say some shit
like that and just break out.

585
00:36:08,246 --> 00:36:10,214
Odin:
What's going on, Dogs?

586
00:36:13,952 --> 00:36:15,442
All right.

587
00:36:16,855 --> 00:36:22,760
You and Desi were going out for four
months before her father had a clue.

588
00:36:22,827 --> 00:36:26,160
So obviously, the girl knows
how to keep a secret.

589
00:36:26,231 --> 00:36:28,893
You grew up in the hood, and
you've seen plenty of hustlers,

590
00:36:28,967 --> 00:36:32,130
but the one thing I do know
better than you is white girls.

591
00:36:32,203 --> 00:36:33,727
And white girls are snaky.

592
00:36:34,806 --> 00:36:36,831
All right,
they're horny snakes.

593
00:36:36,908 --> 00:36:38,933
They act like
we're the ones who want sex,

594
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:41,069
but they want it
worse than us, man.

595
00:36:41,145 --> 00:36:43,705
They're just subtle about
the way they go after it.

596
00:36:43,781 --> 00:36:46,249
Hey, man,
my girl's not like that.

597
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:50,044
But just think about the way
she played her father

598
00:36:50,154 --> 00:36:52,122
when he found out
about you and her.

599
00:36:53,691 --> 00:36:55,659
What? Emily
said something to you?

600
00:36:55,760 --> 00:36:59,719
Hugo: No, but she wouldn't,
because they stick together.

601
00:37:01,266 --> 00:37:03,029
Hugo: There is one way
to find out, though.

602
00:37:03,101 --> 00:37:05,968
- Yeah, like ask Mike.
- No,

603
00:37:06,037 --> 00:37:08,369
because if there is
something going on--

604
00:37:09,440 --> 00:37:11,874
and I'm not saying that there
is something going on--

605
00:37:11,943 --> 00:37:15,037
but if there is
something going on,

606
00:37:15,113 --> 00:37:17,206
they're not just
going to come clean.

607
00:37:17,282 --> 00:37:19,375
Watch her.

608
00:37:19,450 --> 00:37:23,113
If she keeps hanging out with Mike,
if she keeps talking about Mike,

609
00:37:23,221 --> 00:37:25,712
then we've got something
to think about.

610
00:37:26,958 --> 00:37:28,789
We don't let on, bro'.

611
00:37:29,827 --> 00:37:31,988
We just watch.

612
00:38:32,657 --> 00:38:34,181
Mike: What's up, man?

613
00:38:37,462 --> 00:38:39,362
Hey, O,
what's that all about?

614
00:38:44,736 --> 00:38:46,499
- Desi: Hey.
- Hey.

615
00:38:46,571 --> 00:38:47,868
I'm almost ready.

616
00:38:49,073 --> 00:38:50,199
Cool.

617
00:38:51,776 --> 00:38:53,437
Just cool?

618
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:55,445
I've been planning
this night for a month.

619
00:38:55,513 --> 00:38:57,174
Do you know what I had
to do to get that car?

620
00:38:57,248 --> 00:38:58,442
Odin: Yeah, I know.

621
00:39:00,084 --> 00:39:03,019
- Do you have your pass?
- Uh-hmm.

622
00:39:05,123 --> 00:39:06,590
What's wrong with you?

623
00:39:10,194 --> 00:39:11,786
Desi: Hello?

624
00:39:11,863 --> 00:39:13,262
Hey, D...

625
00:39:14,332 --> 00:39:17,096
you never used to go out
with Mike, like--

626
00:39:17,168 --> 00:39:19,762
Iike before I got here or
anything like that, right?

627
00:39:19,837 --> 00:39:22,533
Michael? He's like my best
friend, except for Emily.

628
00:39:24,008 --> 00:39:26,033
But I thought
I was your best friend.

629
00:39:26,110 --> 00:39:30,171
Oh, does my baby feel like
he's got a little competition?

630
00:39:30,248 --> 00:39:33,775
Come on, stop playing around.
Come on, stop!

631
00:39:33,885 --> 00:39:35,352
Damn.

632
00:39:36,788 --> 00:39:39,052
Let's just go, okay?

633
00:39:43,394 --> 00:39:45,225
Did somebody
say something to you?

634
00:39:45,296 --> 00:39:47,230
No, let's just go.

635
00:40:02,380 --> 00:40:05,349
Look, just give me the money.
It's only 100 bucks.

636
00:40:07,318 --> 00:40:08,307
This is it, dude.

637
00:40:08,419 --> 00:40:09,647
I'm tapped out.

638
00:40:09,754 --> 00:40:11,517
Dad said
he won't send any more.

639
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:14,615
Then you'll have
to use his credit card.

640
00:40:14,726 --> 00:40:17,490
- We need a cell phone.
- What?

641
00:40:17,562 --> 00:40:20,759
If this is going to work,
we have to keep in constant contact.

642
00:40:20,832 --> 00:40:22,766
( knocking on door )

643
00:40:26,971 --> 00:40:28,268
Hey, guys.

644
00:40:30,908 --> 00:40:33,138
Hey, Roger,
could you do me a favor?

645
00:40:33,211 --> 00:40:35,577
- Sure.
- Get lost.

646
00:40:46,791 --> 00:40:48,782
I have something for you.

647
00:40:48,893 --> 00:40:51,088
You have things
for lots of guys.

648
00:40:58,703 --> 00:41:00,568
You're amazing.

649
00:41:01,973 --> 00:41:03,702
What are you going
to do with it?

650
00:41:04,776 --> 00:41:06,300
Nothing.

651
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:10,609
I'm not going to keep it.
It's just a little prank.

652
00:41:10,681 --> 00:41:14,583
When it turns up missing,
she's going to go nuts.

653
00:41:16,888 --> 00:41:18,947
Hugo:
What would I do without you?

654
00:41:30,434 --> 00:41:33,369
All this time I've been
looking for romance,

655
00:41:33,437 --> 00:41:36,167
and all I had to do
was steal something.

656
00:41:38,009 --> 00:41:40,273
You didn't steal anything.

657
00:41:41,979 --> 00:41:44,846
You just borrowed it
for a little while.

658
00:41:46,818 --> 00:41:50,049
And if you wouldn't mind,
I'd like to borrow you.

659
00:42:23,988 --> 00:42:27,219
I want you to be able
to do anything.

660
00:42:27,291 --> 00:42:30,488
I want you to do
what you want with me.

661
00:42:31,529 --> 00:42:33,087
Yeah?

662
00:42:34,832 --> 00:42:37,426
I want you to have me
however you want.

663
00:42:37,501 --> 00:42:41,437
Desi: I want to give myself
to you the way you want me.

664
00:42:42,607 --> 00:42:45,474
Don't hold back.

665
00:42:58,856 --> 00:43:01,757
( heavy breathing )

666
00:44:19,971 --> 00:44:21,370
Ow!

667
00:44:21,439 --> 00:44:23,839
Odin, stop!

668
00:44:23,908 --> 00:44:25,637
Stop!

669
00:44:26,911 --> 00:44:28,378
Stop!

670
00:44:28,446 --> 00:44:30,038
( Desi crying )

671
00:44:30,114 --> 00:44:31,445
No!

672
00:44:36,253 --> 00:44:37,914
( Desi screaming )

673
00:46:26,931 --> 00:46:29,661
Woman: ...purposely uses
this maternal imagery

674
00:46:29,733 --> 00:46:31,963
to get him into
doing this dirty work.

675
00:46:32,036 --> 00:46:36,370
"I have given suck and know how tender
it is to love the babe that milks me."

676
00:46:36,440 --> 00:46:42,037
Odin, did you give Desi
a scarf a while back?

677
00:46:42,113 --> 00:46:44,343
Odin: Yeah.

678
00:46:44,415 --> 00:46:46,280
Hugo: It was
silk or something, right?

679
00:46:48,752 --> 00:46:50,481
Odin: Yeah,
I showed it to you.

680
00:46:50,588 --> 00:46:52,556
Teacher: Gentlemen.

681
00:46:55,159 --> 00:46:58,424
Wait, you gave
that scarf to Desi?

682
00:46:58,496 --> 00:47:00,225
You know I did.

683
00:47:00,297 --> 00:47:02,458
You want me
to give that to her?

684
00:47:02,533 --> 00:47:04,467
Hugo:
Don't tell her it's from me.

685
00:47:04,535 --> 00:47:08,369
I think I saw Michael with
that same scarf about an hour ago.

686
00:47:08,439 --> 00:47:10,999
I'm not sure, but I'd swear
it was the same one.

687
00:47:11,075 --> 00:47:11,905
Thanks.

688
00:47:11,976 --> 00:47:14,911
- Get the fuck out of here.
- Teacher: Mr. Goulding, Mr. James,

689
00:47:14,979 --> 00:47:18,972
would either of you care to name
one of Shakespeare's poems for me?

690
00:47:20,151 --> 00:47:21,812
Hugo:
I thought he wrote movies.

691
00:47:21,919 --> 00:47:25,355
- ( students chuckling )
- Perhaps you two should pay attention.

692
00:47:25,456 --> 00:47:28,823
That way, after you've won this
nationally televised championship,

693
00:47:28,893 --> 00:47:30,520
you'll have something
more profound to say.

694
00:47:30,594 --> 00:47:33,688
Emily: What do you mean, rough?
He forced you?

695
00:47:33,764 --> 00:47:35,288
Desi:
No, it wasn't like that.

696
00:47:35,366 --> 00:47:37,425
We were already doing it.

697
00:47:37,501 --> 00:47:39,662
Emily:
Did you say "stop"?

698
00:47:39,737 --> 00:47:41,705
He didn't rape me.

699
00:47:41,772 --> 00:47:45,606
Desi, you know
I like O too, okay?

700
00:47:45,676 --> 00:47:48,975
But you act like the guy's
a saint or something.

701
00:47:49,046 --> 00:47:50,775
Desi: Well,
maybe he's not a saint,

702
00:47:50,848 --> 00:47:53,976
but he's never done anything
even close to that before.

703
00:47:54,084 --> 00:47:56,018
Half the time, he doesn't
even want to do anything.

704
00:47:56,086 --> 00:47:57,986
He just lays naked with me.

705
00:47:58,055 --> 00:48:01,388
Emily:
Desi, you said stop.

706
00:48:09,833 --> 00:48:13,132
Would you be so concerned
if he were white?

707
00:48:14,205 --> 00:48:16,139
That is so easy.

708
00:48:16,207 --> 00:48:19,199
- ( knocking on door )
- Odin: D, it's me.

709
00:48:21,579 --> 00:48:23,547
Desi: What are you doing?
It's after hours.

710
00:48:23,614 --> 00:48:25,047
I know.

711
00:48:25,115 --> 00:48:27,345
I'm sorry.
I just had to see you.

712
00:48:29,853 --> 00:48:32,321
- To say how are you doing, Emily?
- Good.

713
00:48:32,423 --> 00:48:35,756
Sorry, baby, no presents
for you this time.

714
00:48:35,826 --> 00:48:38,056
Desi: Where were you?
Michael was looking for you.

715
00:48:39,730 --> 00:48:41,357
Mike?

716
00:48:41,432 --> 00:48:43,093
Yeah, Michael.

717
00:48:44,902 --> 00:48:46,927
Can I have a kiss?

718
00:48:52,943 --> 00:48:56,470
Hey, D, how come you never wear
that scarf I gave you?

719
00:48:56,547 --> 00:48:58,606
Desi: I hadn't really
thought about it.

720
00:48:58,682 --> 00:49:01,242
- Odin: Can I see it real quick?
- Yeah.

721
00:49:05,789 --> 00:49:07,620
I keep it right here.

722
00:49:08,826 --> 00:49:11,317
- Odin: What, you lost it?
- No, it's here somewhere.

723
00:49:11,395 --> 00:49:15,161
My mamma gave me that scarf
when she got real sick.

724
00:49:15,232 --> 00:49:18,326
She said to make sure to give it
to someone very special,

725
00:49:18,402 --> 00:49:20,336
and it'd keep
our love right.

726
00:49:20,404 --> 00:49:22,895
I'm sure it'll turn up
around here somewhere.

727
00:49:22,973 --> 00:49:26,033
- Could you look some more?
- Emily: She'll find it later.

728
00:49:26,110 --> 00:49:29,841
- Odin: Come on, I'll help you.
- No, I'll find it later.

729
00:49:29,913 --> 00:49:32,177
Right now, I really want
to talk about Michael.

730
00:49:32,249 --> 00:49:35,377
You know, he deserves to play,
and he's your best friend.

731
00:49:35,486 --> 00:49:39,081
- That's all he talks about.
- I really need you to find that scarf.

732
00:49:39,189 --> 00:49:41,157
And I said
I'll find it later.

733
00:49:41,258 --> 00:49:43,021
Hey, D...

734
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:47,595
you'd never give out no love
behind my back, now would you?

735
00:49:47,665 --> 00:49:50,156
I mean, maybe
I'm not enough for you.

736
00:49:50,234 --> 00:49:54,398
You know, especially with you
being all hot and shit.

737
00:49:54,471 --> 00:49:55,768
What?

738
00:49:55,839 --> 00:49:57,807
You know
what I'm talking about.

739
00:49:57,875 --> 00:50:01,311
Hey, Em, you've got
to see this girl in action--

740
00:50:01,378 --> 00:50:03,744
Are you kidding me?!
That's really shitty!

741
00:50:03,814 --> 00:50:05,839
Okay.
But check this.

742
00:50:05,916 --> 00:50:08,009
If you were a virgin
like you said you were,

743
00:50:08,118 --> 00:50:10,518
how come when we're doing it
you're acting all freaky and stuff,

744
00:50:10,587 --> 00:50:13,078
telling me I could do
whatever I want with you?

745
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,658
- I don't need to be here right now.
- Odin: No, Em.

746
00:50:15,726 --> 00:50:19,059
- Emily: I don't think you do either.
- That is not what I meant!

747
00:50:19,129 --> 00:50:22,360
- What the hell is wrong with you?
- Look, let's just find the scarf, OK?

748
00:50:22,433 --> 00:50:25,425
- Emily's going to help us.
- What if Emily doesn't want to help?

749
00:50:25,502 --> 00:50:27,094
I think you should go.

750
00:50:27,171 --> 00:50:29,696
- Where is my scarf?
- I don't know.

751
00:50:29,773 --> 00:50:31,798
- You lost it.
- No, I'll find it later.

752
00:50:31,875 --> 00:50:34,901
Does Mike know where my scarf is?
ls that why you want me to talk to him?

753
00:50:34,978 --> 00:50:36,605
What?

754
00:50:36,680 --> 00:50:40,912
If you want to ask me if I'm cheating
on you, get some balls and ask.

755
00:50:41,018 --> 00:50:43,111
No, I'm not!
Michael?!

756
00:50:43,220 --> 00:50:47,156
You're the only person I've ever been
with and the only person want to be with.

757
00:50:47,224 --> 00:50:51,126
And if you want to be with me,
don't ever talk to me like that again, ever.

758
00:50:54,064 --> 00:50:56,794
I'm always
straight with you, O.

759
00:51:09,580 --> 00:51:12,674
Duke: Two on one half break.
Let's go! Let's go!

760
00:51:12,750 --> 00:51:14,479
Push it!
Push it! Push it!

761
00:51:17,187 --> 00:51:19,348
- ( whistling )
- Duke: Hugo!

762
00:51:19,456 --> 00:51:22,220
For Christ's sake,
look where you are!

763
00:51:22,292 --> 00:51:25,193
Look where the basket is!
Protect the basket! For Christ's sake.

764
00:51:25,262 --> 00:51:27,822
It's two on one fast break!
What, are you deaf?

765
00:51:27,898 --> 00:51:31,356
Odin, where are you? At some picnic?
We've got 10 full minutes.

766
00:51:31,435 --> 00:51:34,097
Let's make it count!
Come on, stack it up!

767
00:51:34,171 --> 00:51:37,163
- Come on, man, stack it up!
- Duke: Let's go!

768
00:51:41,245 --> 00:51:43,406
Come on! Push it!

769
00:51:45,048 --> 00:51:46,879
( whistling )

770
00:51:46,950 --> 00:51:48,611
Give me the ball.
Give me the ball!

771
00:51:48,719 --> 00:51:49,686
Damn it!

772
00:51:49,753 --> 00:51:52,881
You guys are lolly-gagging
the ball up and down the court

773
00:51:52,990 --> 00:51:54,719
Iike a bunch of snails.

774
00:51:54,792 --> 00:51:56,521
You play this way
come game night,

775
00:51:56,593 --> 00:51:59,858
you won't beat the Sisters of Mercy!
All right, Michael,

776
00:51:59,930 --> 00:52:01,625
come in here
and run the point.

777
00:52:01,698 --> 00:52:04,565
Odin, why don't you
take your nap on the bench?

778
00:52:04,635 --> 00:52:06,330
It's more comfortable there.
Let's go, Michael.

779
00:52:06,403 --> 00:52:08,803
I said let's go! Come on!
You've got eight minutes.

780
00:52:19,383 --> 00:52:21,374
What's your fucking
problem, man?

781
00:52:21,485 --> 00:52:24,784
Duke: You get back here, son,
and apologize! Odin!

782
00:52:25,956 --> 00:52:29,551
Odin! You get your ass back
here and apologize.

783
00:52:35,632 --> 00:52:37,429
Jeff, run the team.

784
00:52:37,501 --> 00:52:39,867
- ( whistling )
- Come on, guys.

785
00:52:47,444 --> 00:52:49,036
Hey, Pop.

786
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:50,704
Duke: Have a seat.

787
00:53:01,158 --> 00:53:05,322
It's been a while since
you invited me in for dinner.

788
00:53:05,395 --> 00:53:07,522
Duke:
What is going on with Odin?

789
00:53:16,106 --> 00:53:17,403
I don't know.

790
00:53:19,643 --> 00:53:22,635
I saw him in class today.
He seemed all right.

791
00:53:25,182 --> 00:53:27,776
By the way, I'm getting
an A in English again.

792
00:53:27,885 --> 00:53:30,615
Duke: That's great, son.
Congratulations.

793
00:53:30,721 --> 00:53:34,350
You know I don't ever have
to worry about you, thank God.

794
00:53:34,458 --> 00:53:38,656
You've always done well and
you always will, but Odin's different.

795
00:53:38,729 --> 00:53:40,959
He's all alone here.

796
00:53:41,031 --> 00:53:44,467
There's not even another Black student
in this whole damn place.

797
00:53:44,535 --> 00:53:46,662
We're his family.

798
00:53:46,737 --> 00:53:51,003
I want you to keep an eye on him,
find out what's going on.

799
00:53:52,309 --> 00:53:54,209
- Sure, Pop.
- All right...

800
00:53:54,278 --> 00:53:56,576
'cause if he's
got a problem,

801
00:53:56,647 --> 00:53:58,581
we've got a problem.

802
00:54:02,786 --> 00:54:04,481
All right, Dad.

803
00:54:09,293 --> 00:54:12,524
You know, your mother just
doesn't understand us.

804
00:54:24,608 --> 00:54:26,803
You stay here
and finish your supper.

805
00:54:56,206 --> 00:54:57,969
Announcer: The state finals
are a few days away,

806
00:54:58,041 --> 00:55:00,168
and Palmetto Grove comes in
as a heavy favorite.

807
00:55:00,243 --> 00:55:03,269
Coach Duke Goulding,
or The Duke, as he is called,

808
00:55:03,347 --> 00:55:05,508
has got to be even more
jittery than the players.

809
00:55:05,582 --> 00:55:09,143
A win right here could pave the way
for a position at the college level.

810
00:55:09,252 --> 00:55:10,879
But first, you're about
to see something

811
00:55:10,988 --> 00:55:13,388
that might make the NBA's
finest a little bit nervous.

812
00:55:13,457 --> 00:55:15,322
And that's why
all the scouts are here.

813
00:55:15,392 --> 00:55:18,418
It's the Southeast regional
high school slam dunk contest.

814
00:55:18,495 --> 00:55:20,690
And young legs
mean lots of air.

815
00:55:32,609 --> 00:55:34,941
- What's up, man?
- What's up with you?

816
00:55:36,346 --> 00:55:38,712
You got that for me?

817
00:55:38,782 --> 00:55:42,047
- This ain't your style, player.
- It ain't gonna be.

818
00:55:42,152 --> 00:55:44,347
I just ain't slept
in a couple of days.

819
00:55:44,454 --> 00:55:48,447
Why the fuck are you worried?
Give me the shit and get your ass on.

820
00:55:48,558 --> 00:55:50,150
Money's for customers.

821
00:55:50,227 --> 00:55:52,286
This is a one-time
thing, right?

822
00:56:09,813 --> 00:56:12,941
You're going to have
to get in line, I'm afraid.

823
00:56:13,016 --> 00:56:16,042
Every conference in the country's
been after this kid,

824
00:56:16,153 --> 00:56:19,589
including the ACC,
the Big Twelve, Pac Ten, Big Ten.

825
00:56:19,656 --> 00:56:21,180
I hope you don't think
you're sitting there.

826
00:56:21,291 --> 00:56:24,226
- Bye. Good seeing you.
- I had this seat with Hugo.

827
00:56:24,294 --> 00:56:29,095
Well, Hugo's not here,
and I'm telling you to get lost.

828
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:33,227
- Later, Roger, as in peace.
- Jason, stop. Leave him alone.

829
00:56:33,303 --> 00:56:34,736
Michael, come on.

830
00:56:34,805 --> 00:56:36,238
Go ahead and
keep sitting there.

831
00:56:36,306 --> 00:56:39,639
- Maybe I won't kick your ass again.
- Desi: It's okay, Roger.

832
00:56:39,710 --> 00:56:41,075
You can sit there.
It's fine.

833
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:43,738
- Faggot. Tag along, faggot.
- Jason!

834
00:56:43,814 --> 00:56:45,805
Jason: Why don't you go sit
with some other friends.

835
00:56:45,882 --> 00:56:48,180
Oh, you don't have any.
Everybody hates you.

836
00:56:48,285 --> 00:56:51,550
Stupid tag-along.
Get lost.

837
00:56:51,655 --> 00:56:53,316
Flea.

838
00:56:53,423 --> 00:56:56,324
- Fucking faggot.
- Mike: Fuck off.

839
00:56:57,360 --> 00:57:01,490
- Loser. Fucking loser.
- Get out of here, Roger.

840
00:57:02,866 --> 00:57:06,233
It hurts, doesn't it?
Then get lost.

841
00:57:25,388 --> 00:57:28,585
You've got five minutes, man.
What's going on?

842
00:57:28,658 --> 00:57:30,922
You really
fucked me up, man.

843
00:57:30,994 --> 00:57:33,394
- Me?
- Yeah, you, bitch!

844
00:57:33,463 --> 00:57:39,265
If I knew Desi was going behind
my back, I could deal with that.

845
00:57:39,336 --> 00:57:42,794
But all this wondering you got me
going through is bullshit!

846
00:57:42,873 --> 00:57:44,704
You can't be thinking
about that now.

847
00:57:47,811 --> 00:57:50,371
I'm going to tell you
like this, Hugo.

848
00:57:50,447 --> 00:57:56,249
You better hope and pray you can
prove that Mike is fucking Desi.

849
00:57:56,353 --> 00:57:58,378
You understand me?!

850
00:58:00,991 --> 00:58:03,152
( Hugo coughing )

851
00:58:03,226 --> 00:58:06,127
Hugo: I try to help my friend
and this is what I get?

852
00:58:06,196 --> 00:58:08,721
Why don't you just
fucking forget about it, man?

853
00:58:08,799 --> 00:58:11,267
I mean,
you fucking got everything.

854
00:58:11,334 --> 00:58:14,565
I would give my left nut
to be in your shoes.

855
00:58:18,108 --> 00:58:19,769
Fuck Desi!

856
00:58:19,843 --> 00:58:23,643
She's not some gold medal you need
to win! You're the fucking medal, man!

857
00:58:23,713 --> 00:58:26,443
From the first time I saw her--

858
00:58:28,585 --> 00:58:32,248
the only reason I ever wanted
to do something big

859
00:58:33,356 --> 00:58:37,292
was so she'd be proud
to stand next to me.

860
00:58:38,562 --> 00:58:40,189
Shit.

861
00:58:41,298 --> 00:58:44,096
Look, is she cheating on me
or not?! What the fuck?

862
00:58:44,167 --> 00:58:46,135
Hugo: Let's talk about this
after you win this thing.

863
00:58:46,203 --> 00:58:50,162
Don't you hold back
on me, Hugo. Not now.

864
00:58:50,240 --> 00:58:52,470
- Hugo: Come on.
- No, you come on, bitch!

865
00:58:54,678 --> 00:58:58,307
- What, are you going to hit me?
- I will if you don't speak to me.

866
00:58:58,381 --> 00:59:02,477
I don't know if it's true, but he told
me they were together last night

867
00:59:02,586 --> 00:59:05,987
- and I don't know what else.
- God damn it.

868
00:59:06,056 --> 00:59:08,047
Hugo: That's all
I'm saying for now.

869
00:59:08,158 --> 00:59:10,626
We can get together tonight
and talk about this.

870
00:59:15,298 --> 00:59:17,266
They don't know
who they're fucking with.

871
00:59:17,334 --> 00:59:18,631
What's that?

872
00:59:20,070 --> 00:59:22,402
I said they don't know
who they're fucking with.

873
00:59:24,541 --> 00:59:26,805
Odin: They don't know
who they're fucking with!!

874
00:59:38,355 --> 00:59:40,289
( applause )

875
00:59:42,759 --> 00:59:44,192
Better hurry up, son.
You're late.

876
00:59:44,261 --> 00:59:45,751
Knock them dead.

877
01:00:07,817 --> 01:00:10,183
- Odin James.
- Okay,

878
01:00:10,287 --> 01:00:13,256
highest score is 50.
You get one minute to do three dunks.

879
01:00:13,356 --> 01:00:14,914
I'm only doing one.

880
01:00:15,025 --> 01:00:17,585
- What?
- I'm only doing one.

881
01:00:17,661 --> 01:00:19,424
Woman: But you get
to throw out the two lowest.

882
01:00:19,496 --> 01:00:22,556
Announcer: And now,
our very own Odin James.

883
01:00:22,632 --> 01:00:24,327
( cheering )

884
01:00:27,704 --> 01:00:31,333
Grab your jockstraps, gentlemen.
He's about to blow you away.

885
01:01:08,645 --> 01:01:10,670
Crowd: Go! Go! Go!

886
01:01:25,562 --> 01:01:26,824
Wow, he dunked it!

887
01:01:28,031 --> 01:01:30,499
I didn't think
he could do that anymore.

888
01:01:30,567 --> 01:01:32,194
( cheering )

889
01:01:40,944 --> 01:01:43,105
Crowd: Go! Go! Go!

890
01:01:59,529 --> 01:02:01,087
Ball boy: Yo, man,
that dunk was all that,

891
01:02:01,164 --> 01:02:02,995
- but I need the ball back, kid.
- What?

892
01:02:03,066 --> 01:02:06,524
- The ball, homey. Give it up.
- This ball right here, shorty?

893
01:02:06,603 --> 01:02:08,867
No, nigger, the balls
hanging under your dick.

894
01:02:08,938 --> 01:02:10,565
Watch your fucking mouth.
Who are you talking to?

895
01:02:15,712 --> 01:02:17,680
( crowd booing )

896
01:02:25,188 --> 01:02:27,088
( crowd roaring )

897
01:02:33,096 --> 01:02:35,121
( crowd booing )

898
01:03:12,035 --> 01:03:15,436
Duke: I'm just asking
for one last game, Bob.

899
01:03:15,505 --> 01:03:17,905
Brable: One game for whom?
For you...

900
01:03:17,974 --> 01:03:19,737
or for him?

901
01:03:19,809 --> 01:03:23,438
Because he's lucky
he's not suspended.

902
01:03:23,513 --> 01:03:27,244
Hugo: Yeah, Dad,
who's your favorite now?

903
01:03:39,395 --> 01:03:41,590
Hugo: I'm going
to take care of you, man.

904
01:03:43,766 --> 01:03:48,965
This shit right here...
will help you make it through.

905
01:03:53,309 --> 01:03:55,869
Odin: I don't want
to be doing this.

906
01:03:55,945 --> 01:04:00,041
Just making it through, player.
Just making it through.

907
01:04:30,013 --> 01:04:32,607
Hugo: So, while the shit
was going down tonight,

908
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,207
I was doing
some detective work.

909
01:04:36,786 --> 01:04:39,914
Mike says half the time,
she doesn't want to have sex.

910
01:04:41,224 --> 01:04:43,784
She just wants
to lay naked in the bed.

911
01:04:45,995 --> 01:04:47,986
But they're fucking, O.

912
01:04:48,064 --> 01:04:50,931
And they have been
for over a month now.

913
01:04:51,000 --> 01:04:53,093
They do it in her room.

914
01:04:53,169 --> 01:04:55,069
And there's
one more thing...

915
01:04:55,138 --> 01:04:58,039
Don't get mad at me
for saying this, but...

916
01:05:01,678 --> 01:05:03,942
they call you
"the nigger," man.

917
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:09,681
Desi wouldn't say
nothing like that, man.

918
01:05:11,221 --> 01:05:12,586
( knocking on door )

919
01:05:12,655 --> 01:05:14,748
Shit.

920
01:05:20,029 --> 01:05:23,226
- Hugo: Hey.
- What's the matter?

921
01:05:23,299 --> 01:05:25,995
Nothing.
What do you want?

922
01:05:26,069 --> 01:05:28,503
Man, I just need
to talk to you.

923
01:05:28,571 --> 01:05:31,301
I'm a little busy.
Just give me two minutes.

924
01:05:32,375 --> 01:05:34,570
- All right, but--
- Give me two minutes, all right?

925
01:05:34,644 --> 01:05:36,111
Wait here.

926
01:05:41,284 --> 01:05:43,275
Hugo:
Hey, O. That's Mike.

927
01:05:43,386 --> 01:05:46,287
He wants to talk
to me about Desi.

928
01:05:46,356 --> 01:05:49,951
Listen, I'm going
to ask him what's up.

929
01:05:50,026 --> 01:05:52,324
All right?
You can hear for yourself.

930
01:05:55,598 --> 01:05:57,225
Come on,
let's take it out here.

931
01:05:57,300 --> 01:06:02,169
Hugo, you're my man
for life. Forever.

932
01:06:02,238 --> 01:06:04,604
Hugo: Just stay on the porch
no matter what he says.

933
01:06:04,674 --> 01:06:08,371
Just stay on the bench.
Be quiet, all right?

934
01:06:13,249 --> 01:06:15,547
Hey, man, what have you got
going on here?

935
01:06:16,653 --> 01:06:18,120
What's up, big baller?

936
01:06:18,221 --> 01:06:20,485
Mike:
Don't remind me of basketball.

937
01:06:20,556 --> 01:06:24,424
Hugo: So, you and Desi have been
spending a lot of time together.

938
01:06:24,494 --> 01:06:27,122
If you could just handle her
the way you handle Brandy,

939
01:06:27,196 --> 01:06:28,823
then you'd be in business.

940
01:06:28,898 --> 01:06:31,492
Mike:
That girl does whatever I say.

941
01:06:31,567 --> 01:06:33,262
She might be
in love with me, though.

942
01:06:33,336 --> 01:06:36,203
Hugo: I heard she thinks the two
of you are going to get married.

943
01:06:36,272 --> 01:06:39,867
Mike: Yeah, right. Give me
some credit. She's a slut.

944
01:06:39,942 --> 01:06:42,877
Man, I was
at the library yesterday.

945
01:06:42,945 --> 01:06:44,344
She took me in the back.

946
01:06:44,414 --> 01:06:47,076
Hugo: ln the freaking library?
No fucking way.

947
01:06:47,150 --> 01:06:49,880
Mike: And check this out.
She said, down the road,

948
01:06:49,986 --> 01:06:52,819
even if she's with somebody,
even if she's married,

949
01:06:52,889 --> 01:06:55,323
she said she'd do me
until the day she dies.

950
01:06:55,391 --> 01:06:57,086
Hugo: No fucking way.

951
01:06:57,160 --> 01:06:59,151
Mike:
She does follow me everywhere.

952
01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,695
Brandy:
Have you seen Michael?

953
01:07:00,763 --> 01:07:02,458
What about Odin?

954
01:07:02,532 --> 01:07:05,626
Mike: What about him?
He's a freaking loser.

955
01:07:05,702 --> 01:07:09,604
- The ghetto just popped out of him.
- Hugo: You don't have to go there.

956
01:07:09,672 --> 01:07:12,368
Listen, the nigger's
out of control.

957
01:07:12,442 --> 01:07:14,467
And I'm glad
he's off the team.

958
01:07:14,544 --> 01:07:17,445
And if he comes at me again,
I swear I'll kill his ass.

959
01:07:17,513 --> 01:07:21,176
- ( knocking )
- Brandy: Hugo, where's Michael?

960
01:07:21,250 --> 01:07:22,911
Hugo, I know Mike's in here.

961
01:07:23,019 --> 01:07:26,113
- Open the damn door!
- Mike: Oh, boy.

962
01:07:26,222 --> 01:07:27,917
- Hugo: What's up?
- Hey.

963
01:07:27,990 --> 01:07:29,014
What the hell do you
think you're doing,

964
01:07:29,125 --> 01:07:31,491
giving me something
you got from some other bitch?

965
01:07:31,561 --> 01:07:33,153
Mike: What?

966
01:07:33,229 --> 01:07:36,096
- Brandy: Asshole!
- What are you tripping about?

967
01:07:36,165 --> 01:07:37,826
- It's a present.
- Yeah?

968
01:07:37,900 --> 01:07:40,767
Well, I like presents
where I was the only owner!

969
01:07:40,837 --> 01:07:44,432
Mike: Brandy.
You see what I have to deal with?

970
01:07:44,507 --> 01:07:46,134
You want this?

971
01:07:56,652 --> 01:07:59,246
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

972
01:08:04,627 --> 01:08:07,391
How are we going
to kill this motherfucker?

973
01:08:08,464 --> 01:08:10,364
That's a big step.

974
01:08:11,968 --> 01:08:14,198
What about Desi?

975
01:08:25,281 --> 01:08:27,909
Pawnbroker: I don't get people
in here with that kind of money.

976
01:08:28,017 --> 01:08:31,043
But it is
one hell of a watch.

977
01:08:31,154 --> 01:08:33,213
What are you looking
to get for it?

978
01:08:39,796 --> 01:08:42,264
Hugo: You have any papers
on this .38?

979
01:08:42,331 --> 01:08:45,926
Pawnbroker: On what?
Don't even look in that case.

980
01:08:46,002 --> 01:08:49,802
Don't even think about it, unless
you're ready to pull out some ID.

981
01:08:52,108 --> 01:08:54,508
Listen,
you want that watch.

982
01:08:54,577 --> 01:08:57,239
I want that pistol.

983
01:09:24,707 --> 01:09:27,141
Hugo: You've been
everything to me, O.

984
01:09:27,210 --> 01:09:30,771
To me, you're not my friend,
you're my brother.

985
01:09:30,847 --> 01:09:34,010
And when a brother
is wronged, so am I.

986
01:09:35,952 --> 01:09:37,852
I'm you, O.

987
01:09:37,920 --> 01:09:39,717
I'm a part of you.

988
01:09:42,058 --> 01:09:45,357
The plan I've come up
with is flawless,

989
01:09:46,429 --> 01:09:48,522
planned out to the minute.

990
01:09:50,333 --> 01:09:54,963
I've spent the last few days
going over every possible detail and angle.

991
01:09:56,772 --> 01:09:59,468
All we have to do
is set this thing in motion

992
01:09:59,542 --> 01:10:01,737
and never look back.

993
01:10:02,812 --> 01:10:05,474
Tomorrow I'm going
to talk to my dad.

994
01:10:05,548 --> 01:10:09,541
I'm going to tell him me and Mike
will find our own way to the game.

995
01:10:09,652 --> 01:10:11,847
Hugo: I'll say we
want to get there early.

996
01:10:11,954 --> 01:10:14,752
We'll take Roger's car.

997
01:10:14,824 --> 01:10:16,724
You're going
to talk to Desi.

998
01:10:18,294 --> 01:10:21,127
You'll tell her
you want to make up,

999
01:10:21,197 --> 01:10:24,360
a little love session
before the game.

1000
01:10:25,568 --> 01:10:28,628
She should be
alone in her room.

1001
01:10:28,704 --> 01:10:31,036
Emily will
go on without her.

1002
01:10:32,208 --> 01:10:36,372
For it to work, we have to make
sure it looked like Michael did it.

1003
01:10:39,882 --> 01:10:42,350
We'll leave behind
a little present.

1004
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,977
At exactly 7:00PM,

1005
01:10:47,123 --> 01:10:49,148
you take out Desi...

1006
01:10:51,160 --> 01:10:53,788
and you plant Michael's glass.

1007
01:10:55,731 --> 01:10:58,859
When that's all done,
you call me on Roger's cellular.

1008
01:11:01,837 --> 01:11:04,897
We'll have a rental car
waiting on the side of the road.

1009
01:11:09,245 --> 01:11:10,974
When Mike gets out to help,

1010
01:11:13,049 --> 01:11:15,779
we'll make it
look like a suicide.

1011
01:11:40,943 --> 01:11:43,377
Then we all make our way
to the game on time.

1012
01:11:45,081 --> 01:11:46,571
I know my dad.

1013
01:11:46,649 --> 01:11:48,810
Without Mike,
he's got to play you.

1014
01:11:48,918 --> 01:11:50,977
So we win the game,

1015
01:11:52,088 --> 01:11:55,353
and we all swear
we never saw Mike or Desi at all.

1016
01:11:58,427 --> 01:12:01,885
If we stick to the timetable,
this will work.

1017
01:12:01,964 --> 01:12:03,829
What about Roger?

1018
01:12:03,899 --> 01:12:07,232
Roger thinks you and
Desi are just breaking up.

1019
01:12:07,303 --> 01:12:10,500
But after it's all over,
I'll tell him.

1020
01:12:10,573 --> 01:12:14,065
He'll be so scared,
he'll go along with whatever I say.

1021
01:12:15,778 --> 01:12:17,678
And if he doesn't?

1022
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:21,581
You said you're going all
the way with this thing, right?

1023
01:12:36,632 --> 01:12:38,725
About what time
was the car checked out?

1024
01:12:41,604 --> 01:12:42,628
Yeah.

1025
01:12:42,705 --> 01:12:44,263
All right.
Yeah, thank you.

1026
01:12:44,340 --> 01:12:46,570
Okay.
I appreciate it. Bye.

1027
01:12:48,477 --> 01:12:51,776
- Herb's on time, so far.
- ( knocking )

1028
01:12:56,318 --> 01:12:57,580
All right.

1029
01:13:03,693 --> 01:13:07,561
Hey, man. Man, it's
game time, baby. Let's do it.

1030
01:13:08,230 --> 01:13:10,391
Hugo: A little
pep-up for the road?

1031
01:13:10,466 --> 01:13:12,991
No, I can't.
Not tonight.

1032
01:13:13,069 --> 01:13:14,627
Oh Mike, come on.

1033
01:13:14,704 --> 01:13:17,332
This is my last game
as a Hawk, bro'.

1034
01:13:17,406 --> 01:13:19,203
I'm too nervous, man.

1035
01:13:22,545 --> 01:13:25,878
We shall go no more
roving so late into the night.

1036
01:13:25,948 --> 01:13:28,883
- Mike: Look, man, I can't.
- Mike.

1037
01:13:28,984 --> 01:13:31,680
All right.

1038
01:13:37,626 --> 01:13:40,220
Oh, fuck! I'm supposed
to meet with Brandy.

1039
01:13:40,296 --> 01:13:42,821
- She was going to ride with us.
- Not anymore, comrade.

1040
01:13:42,898 --> 01:13:45,867
Hugo: She's got wheels.
Don't worry about it.

1041
01:14:04,820 --> 01:14:06,879
Emily: You sure
you don't want me to wait?

1042
01:14:06,989 --> 01:14:10,254
- Save me a seat.
- Okay.

1043
01:14:10,292 --> 01:14:12,260
Later.

1044
01:14:47,229 --> 01:14:49,720
Man, you're driving
like my grandmother.

1045
01:14:51,600 --> 01:14:54,569
Come on, man.
The Duke is going to kill us.

1046
01:15:18,828 --> 01:15:20,659
Hugo: Did you see
that car back there?

1047
01:15:20,729 --> 01:15:22,060
What?

1048
01:15:24,533 --> 01:15:26,091
Hugo: The one with
the flashing lights.

1049
01:15:26,168 --> 01:15:30,264
- The guy might be in trouble.
- No, no way, man.

1050
01:15:30,339 --> 01:15:32,307
We're going
to miss warm-ups.

1051
01:15:32,374 --> 01:15:35,775
It'll take just a second to check out.
It's going to be freezing tonight.

1052
01:15:35,845 --> 01:15:37,710
We've got to check it out.

1053
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:40,976
( cheering )

1054
01:15:48,457 --> 01:15:51,949
Send someone over to check
on their rooms. Hurry!

1055
01:15:52,027 --> 01:15:53,790
Let's go,
lads, let's go!

1056
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:57,390
Duke, this is Mr. Bradley, head of
the Game Council Athletic Department.

1057
01:15:57,466 --> 01:15:59,525
Duke: Yes, sir. It's
a pleasure to meet you.

1058
01:15:59,602 --> 01:16:02,400
It's a pleasure to meet you, couch.
I tell you, I've been following you all year,

1059
01:16:02,471 --> 01:16:04,029
and you've done
a great job.

1060
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:06,370
Thanks very much.
I appreciate that.

1061
01:16:06,442 --> 01:16:08,433
I wouldn't mind helping
you guys out next season.

1062
01:16:08,510 --> 01:16:12,913
I hear that. I'd like to talk
to the Odin kid, if any way possible.

1063
01:16:12,982 --> 01:16:15,974
Duke: Sir, the whole world
would like to talk to Odin.

1064
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:17,882
Bradley: Saw him
in the North Charleston semis,

1065
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:21,753
he lacerated their defense.
Nobody's done that all year.

1066
01:16:21,824 --> 01:16:25,123
- Duke: He had some good coaching.
- Bradley: I'd have to agree with you.

1067
01:16:25,194 --> 01:16:27,094
- Let's talk after the game, couch.
- Duke: All right, sir.

1068
01:16:27,162 --> 01:16:29,289
Bradley: He'd sure look good
in that garnet and black.

1069
01:16:30,366 --> 01:16:33,494
- Did you comp his ticket?
- Yes, I did.

1070
01:16:33,569 --> 01:16:34,934
Duke: Come on, lads, let's go.

1071
01:16:35,004 --> 01:16:36,938
Come on, sweat it up.

1072
01:16:55,024 --> 01:16:56,855
Hey, mister,
you're all right?

1073
01:16:58,594 --> 01:16:59,891
Mike: What the fuck?!

1074
01:16:59,962 --> 01:17:02,192
Do it, Rog.
Do it.

1075
01:17:03,966 --> 01:17:05,160
Roger: Fuck!

1076
01:17:08,470 --> 01:17:10,631
Let it go!
Let it go!

1077
01:17:13,609 --> 01:17:15,474
Mike:
What the fuck, man?!

1078
01:17:15,544 --> 01:17:17,239
What's wrong
with you, man?

1079
01:17:18,747 --> 01:17:19,975
Hugo: All right.

1080
01:17:21,350 --> 01:17:24,148
Hugo: No!
Shit! Fuck, Rog.

1081
01:17:24,253 --> 01:17:29,020
It's got to look like
a fucking suicide! Fuck!

1082
01:17:29,091 --> 01:17:32,822
I got him!
Just like you said.

1083
01:17:32,895 --> 01:17:35,363
I shot the fucker!
Now, we do it close.

1084
01:17:35,431 --> 01:17:38,366
Hugo: No, the cops can tell
someone else shot the first bullet.

1085
01:17:38,434 --> 01:17:41,267
You herbed us, man!
You fucking herbed us!

1086
01:17:41,337 --> 01:17:43,134
Hugo:
You fucking herbed us!

1087
01:17:43,205 --> 01:17:45,730
- Roger: Hugo, we have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1088
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,332
- You know I gave it to you.
- Where's the scarf?

1089
01:17:47,409 --> 01:17:49,536
- We have to go.
- Where's the scarf?

1090
01:17:49,611 --> 01:17:53,012
- Let me get him off the road.
- Rog! Rog! Rog!

1091
01:17:53,082 --> 01:17:56,677
When that car gets here, I'll tell
them you shot him in self-defense.

1092
01:17:56,785 --> 01:17:58,844
He attacked you and
you shot him in self-defense.

1093
01:17:58,954 --> 01:18:00,979
If he wakes up,
he's going to tell on me.

1094
01:18:03,692 --> 01:18:07,389
It won't matter, Rog.
Desi's dead. I'm sorry, bro'.

1095
01:18:18,607 --> 01:18:20,097
What time is it?

1096
01:18:34,990 --> 01:18:36,753
Hold on! Hold on!

1097
01:18:36,825 --> 01:18:40,625
Brandy,
call 911, okay?

1098
01:18:40,696 --> 01:18:43,028
Roger hit Michael with a crow bar
and then Michael shot him.

1099
01:18:58,981 --> 01:19:00,812
- Hugo: Brandy, help me!
- Oh, my God!

1100
01:19:00,883 --> 01:19:03,977
I need your help!
We need to get him to a hospital!

1101
01:19:04,086 --> 01:19:07,180
Come on, Brandy,
you need to help me, please.

1102
01:19:07,289 --> 01:19:09,257
Come on, Brandy!

1103
01:19:09,358 --> 01:19:10,825
Brandy!

1104
01:19:10,893 --> 01:19:12,019
Fuck!

1105
01:20:05,114 --> 01:20:06,706
I'm sorry.

1106
01:20:17,793 --> 01:20:20,193
I'm sorry.

1107
01:20:22,731 --> 01:20:24,221
Odin.

1108
01:20:53,896 --> 01:20:56,456
- ( Desi gasping )
- I saw Mike with the scarf.

1109
01:20:56,532 --> 01:20:58,261
He's dead.

1110
01:20:58,333 --> 01:21:00,324
He told me
you were with him.

1111
01:21:00,402 --> 01:21:02,427
( sobbing )
Now he's dead.

1112
01:21:02,504 --> 01:21:04,267
He's dead.

1113
01:21:06,542 --> 01:21:08,373
Odin: Stop. Stop.

1114
01:21:09,711 --> 01:21:12,509
I want to be able
to let you go, but I can't.

1115
01:21:12,581 --> 01:21:15,948
I wish I could,
but I can't. I can't.

1116
01:21:16,051 --> 01:21:19,487
I can't. I can't.

1117
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:26,486
Shh.

1118
01:21:26,562 --> 01:21:29,895
Shh. Shh.
Go to sleep.

1119
01:21:29,965 --> 01:21:32,433
Shh. Stop. Please.

1120
01:21:32,501 --> 01:21:34,492
Go to sleep.
Go to sleep.

1121
01:21:34,570 --> 01:21:37,198
Go to sleep. Go to sleep.

1122
01:21:39,908 --> 01:21:42,536
- Jason, have you seen Desi?
- Nope.

1123
01:21:42,611 --> 01:21:44,340
- What about Hugo?
- Uh-uh.

1124
01:21:44,413 --> 01:21:45,937
No?

1125
01:22:00,562 --> 01:22:02,928
- Emily: Desi?
- ( knocking )

1126
01:22:02,998 --> 01:22:03,930
Desi?

1127
01:22:08,837 --> 01:22:10,862
- Odin: Shh.
- Emily: Desi?

1128
01:22:22,517 --> 01:22:23,779
Hey.

1129
01:22:29,091 --> 01:22:30,422
Brandy:
They killed him!

1130
01:22:30,492 --> 01:22:32,983
- They killed Michael!
- Jason: What are you talking about?

1131
01:22:33,061 --> 01:22:33,993
Hugo!

1132
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:35,723
- Emily: You killed her?
- You shut up!

1133
01:22:35,797 --> 01:22:38,265
- Odin: Shut up!
- Emily: You fucking killed her!

1134
01:22:38,333 --> 01:22:40,062
- Hugo: Hey.
- Emily: No!

1135
01:22:40,135 --> 01:22:41,363
Tell me Odin is lying.

1136
01:22:41,436 --> 01:22:44,963
Tell me you didn't say
Desi was cheating on him!

1137
01:22:45,040 --> 01:22:48,305
- I told him what I heard.
- That's a lie! Desi and Michael!?

1138
01:22:48,377 --> 01:22:50,470
- You said she slept with him!?
- Emily, shut up!

1139
01:22:50,545 --> 01:22:54,072
- Somebody get an ambulance!
- Fuck off! Get off her!

1140
01:22:54,149 --> 01:22:56,413
- Hugo: Emily!
- Odin: She was a ho'!

1141
01:22:56,518 --> 01:22:59,510
Desi was fucking Mike!
He admitted it!

1142
01:22:59,621 --> 01:23:03,523
And she gave him my scarf.
They were laughing at me!

1143
01:23:03,592 --> 01:23:05,184
Hugo, tell her!

1144
01:23:05,260 --> 01:23:07,490
- Odin: Tell her, man!
- Emily: That silk scarf?

1145
01:23:07,562 --> 01:23:09,189
Hugo:
Emily, be quiet.

1146
01:23:09,264 --> 01:23:11,164
No. No, Hugo.

1147
01:23:11,233 --> 01:23:14,225
- Shut the fuck up, Emily.
- Hugo had that scarf.

1148
01:23:14,303 --> 01:23:16,328
- Hugo: Emily.
- You begged me to steal it for you!

1149
01:23:16,405 --> 01:23:18,965
She's fucking lying, bro'.
She is fuckin' lying.

1150
01:23:19,041 --> 01:23:21,100
Don't even fucking pay
any attention to her.

1151
01:23:21,176 --> 01:23:23,508
- You gave that scarf to Michael.
- Tell the truth!

1152
01:23:23,578 --> 01:23:26,445
- You gave that scarf to Michael!
- Tell the truth, Emily!

1153
01:23:26,515 --> 01:23:28,005
You gave
that scarf to Michael!

1154
01:23:41,797 --> 01:23:43,765
( students screaming )

1155
01:23:47,769 --> 01:23:49,361
Jason: Stay down!

1156
01:24:06,254 --> 01:24:10,657
Odin: Jason,
ask him why he did this.

1157
01:24:10,726 --> 01:24:12,591
Ask him!

1158
01:24:12,661 --> 01:24:14,925
You won't ask me nothing.

1159
01:24:14,996 --> 01:24:17,863
Hugo: I did what I did.
That's all you need to know.

1160
01:24:22,270 --> 01:24:24,761
From here on,
I'll say nothing.

1161
01:24:24,840 --> 01:24:27,673
- ( police sirens blaring )
- Hugo...

1162
01:24:31,213 --> 01:24:32,737
- Jason: Hugo!
- ( students screaming )

1163
01:24:32,814 --> 01:24:34,338
Sit the fuck down!

1164
01:24:34,416 --> 01:24:38,250
Everybody sit down
and shut the fuck up!

1165
01:24:38,353 --> 01:24:40,685
Now, somebody
here knows the truth.

1166
01:24:40,756 --> 01:24:44,123
Somebody needs
to tell the goddamn truth.

1167
01:24:44,192 --> 01:24:45,420
( woman weeping )

1168
01:24:45,494 --> 01:24:48,520
My life is over.
That's it.

1169
01:24:48,597 --> 01:24:51,623
But while you're
all out here living yours,

1170
01:24:51,700 --> 01:24:55,659
sitting around, talking about the nigger
who lost it, back in high school,

1171
01:24:55,737 --> 01:24:59,298
you make sure
you tell them the truth.

1172
01:24:59,374 --> 01:25:02,138
You tell them
I loved that girl.

1173
01:25:02,210 --> 01:25:04,235
I did.

1174
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:05,677
But I got played.

1175
01:25:05,747 --> 01:25:08,716
He twisted my head up.
He fucked it up.

1176
01:25:09,818 --> 01:25:12,184
I ain't no different
than none of you all.

1177
01:25:12,254 --> 01:25:14,222
My mom ain't no crack head.

1178
01:25:14,289 --> 01:25:16,154
I wasn't no gangbanger.

1179
01:25:16,224 --> 01:25:19,193
It wasn't some hood rat
drug dealer that tripped me up.

1180
01:25:19,294 --> 01:25:23,162
It was this white, prep school
motherfucker standing right there.

1181
01:25:23,231 --> 01:25:24,323
Police officer:
Put the gun down!

1182
01:25:24,399 --> 01:25:26,390
Come on, son!
Drop it! Put it down!

1183
01:25:26,468 --> 01:25:28,868
You tell them
where I'm from...

1184
01:25:28,937 --> 01:25:30,802
didn't make me do this.

1185
01:25:51,293 --> 01:25:59,997
-- Di tue materne viscere, Gesú --

1186
01:26:00,068 --> 01:26:12,776
-- Prega per chi adorando
a te si prostra, --

1187
01:26:12,848 --> 01:26:27,092
-- Prega nel peccator,
per I'innocente, --

1188
01:26:27,162 --> 01:26:37,868
-- E pel debole oppresso
e pel possente, --

1189
01:26:37,939 --> 01:26:50,909
-- Misero anch'esso,
tua pietá dimostra --

1190
01:26:53,488 --> 01:27:00,485
-- Prega per chi
sotto I'oltraggio piega. --

1191
01:27:07,435 --> 01:27:10,802
Hugo: All my life,
I always wanted to fly.

1192
01:27:12,173 --> 01:27:15,165
I always wanted
to live like a hawk.

1193
01:27:27,055 --> 01:27:30,354
I know you're not supposed
to be jealous of anything, but...

1194
01:27:31,993 --> 01:27:33,654
to take flight,

1195
01:27:34,863 --> 01:27:37,627
to soar above
everything and everyone...

1196
01:27:40,168 --> 01:27:41,965
now, that's living.

1197
01:27:45,974 --> 01:27:49,068
But a hawk is no good
around normal birds.

1198
01:27:50,879 --> 01:27:52,779
It can't fit in.

1199
01:27:54,583 --> 01:27:58,110
Even though all the other birds
probably want to be hawks,

1200
01:27:59,888 --> 01:28:02,118
they hate him
for what they can't be--

1201
01:28:04,559 --> 01:28:05,821
proud,

1202
01:28:06,895 --> 01:28:08,920
powerful,

1203
01:28:08,997 --> 01:28:10,521
determined,

1204
01:28:13,668 --> 01:28:15,192
dark.

1205
01:28:18,740 --> 01:28:20,674
Odin is a hawk.

1206
01:28:22,677 --> 01:28:24,542
He soars above us.

1207
01:28:27,649 --> 01:28:29,116
He can fly.

1208
01:28:37,826 --> 01:28:39,851
And one of these days,

1209
01:28:40,929 --> 01:28:43,591
everyone is going
to pay attention to me...

1210
01:28:51,906 --> 01:28:54,670
because I'm going
to fly, too.
