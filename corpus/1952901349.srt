About the fact that
you never called him back.

There has been
the question of...

Whether I'm up
to the task.

27

Your father had
decades of experience,

what got this project
off the ground.

what it's like for me.

179
00:09:08,581 --> 00:09:10,714
Come on, Ella!
It's school!
It's not prison!
Dad!

180
00:09:10,782 --> 00:09:13,250
I know you're going
through some sort of
teenage crisis,

181
00:09:13,352 --> 00:09:15,352
But I am not gonna
let you throw away
your future

182
00:09:15,420 --> 00:09:17,188
To follow some
stupid fantasy!

183
00:09:17,255 --> 00:09:19,390
I knew you wouldn't
understand.

184
00:09:19,457 --> 00:09:21,458
You don't care
about my feelings.

185
00:09:21,526 --> 00:09:23,728
All you care about
is this stupid company.

186
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:25,229
You don't know what
you're talking about.

187
00:09:25,297 --> 00:09:26,597
This stupid
company is--

188
00:09:26,665 --> 00:09:28,365
Grandma said there was
nothing keeping me there,

189
00:09:28,433 --> 00:09:30,467
And you know what?
She was right.

190
00:09:30,536 --> 00:09:32,336
[Door slams]

191
00:09:36,542 --> 00:09:38,275
Got good news
and bad news.

192
00:09:38,343 --> 00:09:41,578
Your echocardiogram
showed significant blockage
on two of your arteries.

193
00:09:41,646 --> 00:09:44,081
I certainly hope
that's the bad news.

194
00:09:44,149 --> 00:09:45,616
It is.
The good news is,

195
00:09:45,683 --> 00:09:47,318
With a fairly
routine bypass,

196
00:09:47,386 --> 00:09:49,053
You'll be as good
as new. But--

197
00:09:49,121 --> 00:09:52,356
I've never been sick
a day in my life.

198
00:09:52,424 --> 00:09:54,091
But, to be honest,

199
00:09:54,159 --> 00:09:56,260
After watching Eliot
in that hospital
all those months,

200
00:09:56,328 --> 00:09:58,396
I never want to
set foot in one again.

201
00:09:58,464 --> 00:09:59,663
I understand.

202
00:09:59,731 --> 00:10:01,632
But this is
a serious situation.

203
00:10:01,700 --> 00:10:02,833
Without the operation--

204
00:10:02,901 --> 00:10:04,668
I could die?
Yes.

205
00:10:04,703 --> 00:10:06,270
You could die.

206
00:10:06,338 --> 00:10:09,740
We need to get you
into the hospital
as soon as possible.

207
00:10:09,807 --> 00:10:11,942
Can I have
a day or two

208
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:14,112
Before I commit
to a surgery date?

209
00:10:14,179 --> 00:10:15,947
Sure.

210
00:10:16,014 --> 00:10:17,815
In the meantime,
we need to get you going

211
00:10:17,883 --> 00:10:19,416
On a new blood pressure
medication.

212
00:10:19,484 --> 00:10:21,452
It could make you feel
a little lightheaded
at first,

213
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:23,086
So try to take it easy.

214
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,590
Can I drive?
I wouldn't recommend it.

215
00:10:25,658 --> 00:10:27,658
At least
not for a while.

216
00:10:27,726 --> 00:10:29,359
Sorry about that, everybody.
What did I miss?

217
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,594
I was just telling
your mother--

218
00:10:30,662 --> 00:10:33,330
I'll fill him in later.
Come on, dear.

219
00:10:33,398 --> 00:10:35,933
Annie... Remember.

220
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,234
With this new medication,

221
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:39,503
No driving if
you feel lightheaded.

222
00:10:39,571 --> 00:10:42,139
Thank you, doctor.

223
00:10:46,979 --> 00:10:50,448
[Guitar playing]

224
00:10:57,389 --> 00:11:00,792
[song ends]

225
00:11:00,859 --> 00:11:03,161
[applause]

226
00:11:05,898 --> 00:11:08,800
Let's hear it again
for Kim Bobletta!

227
00:11:11,469 --> 00:11:15,139
And now please
welcome... Ella.

228
00:11:15,207 --> 00:11:18,109
[Applause]

229
00:11:52,411 --> 00:11:53,811
Sorry. Whoops.

230
00:12:01,453 --> 00:12:03,454
Are you sure Dr. Meldon
didn't say anything else?

231
00:12:03,522 --> 00:12:06,357
It's just blood pressure
medication?

232
00:12:06,425 --> 00:12:07,658
That's all.

233
00:12:07,726 --> 00:12:09,560
But, now that
I can't go alone,

234
00:12:09,627 --> 00:12:11,361
I need you to make
that trip with me.

235
00:12:11,429 --> 00:12:13,030
Mom, that's
2,000 Miles away.

236
00:12:13,065 --> 00:12:14,632
I've got a great car.

237
00:12:14,700 --> 00:12:16,166
I can't do this
right now, mom.

238
00:12:16,234 --> 00:12:18,169
I told you,
there's too much
going on at work.

239
00:12:18,236 --> 00:12:19,570
As soon as
the project is over,

240
00:12:19,638 --> 00:12:20,838
I'll take you there
myself.

241
00:12:20,905 --> 00:12:22,373
That might be too late.

242
00:12:22,440 --> 00:12:24,842
Too late for what?
Mom, what are you
not telling me?

243
00:12:24,909 --> 00:12:27,979
Nothing. But with
the wedding anniversary
coming up--

244
00:12:28,046 --> 00:12:30,581
I'll take you to a nice
dinner to celebrate your
wedding anniversary.

245
00:12:30,649 --> 00:12:31,916
Why don't--oh!

246
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:33,050
Annie: Oh, my!

247
00:12:38,690 --> 00:12:40,658
Mom!

248
00:12:40,726 --> 00:12:42,360
What if I hadn't
been here?

249
00:12:42,427 --> 00:12:44,395
What would you have done?

250
00:12:44,462 --> 00:12:47,064
Ok, that's it.
You can't stay here
anymore.

251
00:12:47,131 --> 00:12:48,666
This is not just
for my peace of mind.

252
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,067
It's for your safety.

253
00:12:50,134 --> 00:12:51,936
What if you got someone
to stay with me?

254
00:12:52,003 --> 00:12:53,871
For how long?
That's really expensive.

255
00:12:53,939 --> 00:12:55,773
Your father and I
built this house

256
00:12:55,841 --> 00:12:57,775
With our bare hands.

257
00:12:57,842 --> 00:12:59,443
It's all I've got left.

258
00:12:59,510 --> 00:13:01,045
He was my best friend.

259
00:13:01,112 --> 00:13:02,980
We did everything
together.

260
00:13:03,048 --> 00:13:05,983
We were supposed to leave
this earth together.

261
00:13:09,854 --> 00:13:13,457
If I move to that place,
will you make me a promise?

262
00:13:13,524 --> 00:13:14,925
Anything.

263
00:13:14,960 --> 00:13:16,960
You have to take me
to Annie's point. Please.

264
00:13:17,028 --> 00:13:18,496
I already told you,
as soon as--

265
00:13:18,563 --> 00:13:20,097
I need a promise.
I promise.

266
00:13:20,164 --> 00:13:23,100
And it has to be
all of us--
you and me and Ella.

267
00:13:23,168 --> 00:13:24,501
Ok.
And we have to drive.

268
00:13:24,569 --> 00:13:26,804
It'll force you
to spend time with Ella,

269
00:13:26,871 --> 00:13:28,472
Get to know
each other again,

270
00:13:28,540 --> 00:13:30,207
Get to be friends again.

271
00:13:30,275 --> 00:13:32,509
Mom...
Whatever you want.

272
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,548
I've got to go
back to work, ok?

273
00:13:37,615 --> 00:13:39,683
Just call me
if you need anything.

274
00:13:39,751 --> 00:13:42,186
And no stoves,
all right?

275
00:13:43,855 --> 00:13:45,489
I'll see you.

276
00:13:50,528 --> 00:13:52,029
Dad?

277
00:13:52,097 --> 00:13:54,565
Oh!
I'm sorry.

278
00:13:54,632 --> 00:13:56,067
Oh, you should not
sneak up on me.

279
00:13:56,134 --> 00:13:57,501
Dad, I said
I was sorry.

280
00:13:57,569 --> 00:13:59,736
Yeah, but what
I'm telling you--
dad!

281
00:13:59,804 --> 00:14:01,672
It's all right.
What do you need,
honey?

282
00:14:01,739 --> 00:14:03,441
[Sighs]

283
00:14:05,277 --> 00:14:06,877
Do you like
construction?

284
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,714
Uh... Sure.

285
00:14:10,782 --> 00:14:12,850
Did grandpa make you
work with him?

286
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:16,620
No. No, I think he just
always wanted me to...

287
00:14:16,688 --> 00:14:18,322
Do whatever
made me happy.

288
00:14:18,389 --> 00:14:20,357
He did say his door
would always be open,

289
00:14:20,425 --> 00:14:24,161
And then one day
I just walked in. Why?

290
00:14:24,228 --> 00:14:26,396
Just asking, I guess.

291
00:14:28,667 --> 00:14:31,568
Mom would've been
46 tomorrow.

292
00:14:32,904 --> 00:14:34,304
I know.

293
00:14:38,443 --> 00:14:40,811
Remember the 40th
birthday party
we threw for her?

294
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:42,045
The surprise party?

295
00:14:42,113 --> 00:14:43,647
Oh, some surprise.
She knew.

296
00:14:43,715 --> 00:14:45,849
Yeah, but she pretended
that she didn't.

297
00:14:45,917 --> 00:14:49,052
Out of all the places
we could've gone,

298
00:14:49,120 --> 00:14:50,521
She wanted to go...

299
00:14:50,589 --> 00:14:52,323
Roller skating.

300
00:14:52,390 --> 00:14:54,725
My knees have never
been the same.

301
00:15:03,535 --> 00:15:05,202
Dad?

302
00:15:05,269 --> 00:15:07,671
I really don't think
that I'm making a mistake.

303
00:15:09,341 --> 00:15:11,875
To tell you the truth,
I'm not really sure
what you're doing.

304
00:15:11,944 --> 00:15:13,777
I know I have
some talent with music.

305
00:15:13,845 --> 00:15:17,113
I just don't know--

306
00:15:17,182 --> 00:15:19,082
[cell phone rings]
[sighs]

307
00:15:19,150 --> 00:15:20,217
Sorry.

308
00:15:22,788 --> 00:15:24,221
Hello?

309
00:15:24,289 --> 00:15:26,090
Oh, yes, Mr. Backis.

310
00:15:26,158 --> 00:15:29,226
No, no. We've avoided
that with Mr. Nucci.

311
00:15:29,394 --> 00:15:31,996
Tomorrow? Um...

312
00:15:32,030 --> 00:15:33,563
I'm supposed
to bring my mother

313
00:15:33,631 --> 00:15:35,933
To a retirement
community tomorrow.

314
00:15:36,001 --> 00:15:38,736
Mr. Backis, can I
call you back?

315
00:15:38,803 --> 00:15:40,704
Thank you.

316
00:15:40,772 --> 00:15:42,339
Ok, bye.

317
00:15:44,509 --> 00:15:46,043
Do you want me
to go with grandma

318
00:15:46,111 --> 00:15:47,277
To her new place?

319
00:15:47,345 --> 00:15:50,047
It's not just
the work, Ella.

320
00:15:50,115 --> 00:15:52,249
It's...

321
00:15:52,317 --> 00:15:55,552
I understand.
I'll go with her.

322
00:15:59,023 --> 00:16:00,958
Annie: I don't know
if Richard's gonna
keep his promise.

323
00:16:01,025 --> 00:16:03,194
Maybe I should just
pack the car up

324
00:16:03,261 --> 00:16:05,662
And head out
to Annie's point.

325
00:16:05,730 --> 00:16:07,698
It's ridiculous,
isn't it?

326
00:16:09,201 --> 00:16:13,036
I know I made
that promise to you.

327
00:16:13,105 --> 00:16:16,974
I'm just not sure
how I'm going to
pull it off.

328
00:16:16,975 --> 00:16:20,677
Well, we'll talk
more about this
in the morning.

329
00:16:25,750 --> 00:16:28,052
Good night, my love.

330
00:16:36,794 --> 00:16:38,795
You have all your pills?

331
00:16:38,864 --> 00:16:41,165
Yes, Richard.

332
00:16:41,233 --> 00:16:43,033
I wish I could drive you
to the orientation.

333
00:16:43,101 --> 00:16:44,501
That's ok.

334
00:16:44,569 --> 00:16:46,237
It's just that
I canceled on these
guys yesterday.

335
00:16:46,304 --> 00:16:47,872
I said it's ok.

336
00:16:47,939 --> 00:16:49,640
I know this is
all happening
really fast,

337
00:16:49,707 --> 00:16:51,041
But you're gonna
like the place,
I know you will.

338
00:16:51,109 --> 00:16:52,409
And just think--
you're gonna be

339
00:16:52,477 --> 00:16:53,811
Practically neighbors
with Louise.

340
00:16:53,879 --> 00:16:55,212
I'm gonna be fine.

341
00:16:55,280 --> 00:16:56,981
Are you gonna be
ok to drive?

342
00:16:57,048 --> 00:16:59,349
Ella's here.
I'll be fine.

343
00:16:59,417 --> 00:17:01,685
Richard: All right.
So, I'll, uh...

344
00:17:01,753 --> 00:17:03,720
I'll stop in later tonight
to get you settled.

345
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:05,189
Thank you.

346
00:17:12,063 --> 00:17:13,263
You're a good son.

347
00:17:13,331 --> 00:17:14,431
Thanks, mom.

348
00:17:29,915 --> 00:17:31,181
Hey.

349
00:17:31,249 --> 00:17:33,417
Make a right here,
grandma.

350
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,533
Gramm, you were supposed
to turn right there.

351
00:17:49,568 --> 00:17:52,068
I probably should've
told your father.

352
00:17:52,136 --> 00:17:54,371
I'm not moving in
there today.

353
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:56,539
What are you
talking about?

354
00:17:56,607 --> 00:17:59,977
I thought about it.
I did.

355
00:18:00,044 --> 00:18:02,812
But I truly
can't remember

356
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:05,015
What Annie's point
looked like.

357
00:18:05,083 --> 00:18:08,052
And I need to be there
for my anniversary.

358
00:18:08,119 --> 00:18:10,520
I'm going to California.

359
00:18:10,588 --> 00:18:12,322
And I need you
to go with me.

360
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:15,292
What?
We're going
to California.

361
00:18:15,393 --> 00:18:16,593
I can't.

362
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:18,728
Give me one
good reason why not.

363
00:18:18,830 --> 00:18:20,130
My father.

364
00:18:20,198 --> 00:18:21,898
Oh, I can handle him.

365
00:18:21,966 --> 00:18:24,901
What are you gonna do,
stay here, pay rent,

366
00:18:24,969 --> 00:18:27,804
Mope around? You want
to be a songwriter.

367
00:18:27,872 --> 00:18:30,073
You have to have
something to write about.

368
00:18:30,141 --> 00:18:31,508
It's not that easy.

369
00:18:31,609 --> 00:18:34,078
You wouldn't want me to
drive there by myself,
would you?

370
00:18:34,145 --> 00:18:35,479
That's not fair.

371
00:18:35,580 --> 00:18:36,680
I'm an old lady.

372
00:18:36,748 --> 00:18:39,783
I'd be all alone
for 2,000 Miles.

373
00:18:39,885 --> 00:18:41,151
And all I have
is an old map.

374
00:18:41,219 --> 00:18:42,252
Grandma!

375
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:44,154
I'm also on this
new medication.

376
00:18:44,289 --> 00:18:46,624
I'm not even sure
I can drive on my own.

377
00:18:46,691 --> 00:18:49,293
I don't have my guitar
or any of my clothes.

378
00:18:49,361 --> 00:18:50,694
Oh, we can get those.

379
00:18:50,762 --> 00:18:52,463
I have plenty of cash.

380
00:18:52,530 --> 00:18:54,364
And there are always
credit cards.

381
00:18:58,069 --> 00:18:59,936
Thank you, Ella bear.

382
00:19:05,110 --> 00:19:07,277
Come on, Ella.

383
00:19:08,446 --> 00:19:10,614
Let's live a little.

384
00:19:53,824 --> 00:19:55,892
I thought you said
you couldn't drive.

385
00:19:55,960 --> 00:19:58,595
It's just a little
further up this way.

386
00:20:00,598 --> 00:20:02,265
Put that book down
for a second,

387
00:20:02,333 --> 00:20:06,002
And grab that
small painting
behind your seat.

388
00:20:10,441 --> 00:20:12,309
We weren't
much older than you

389
00:20:12,377 --> 00:20:14,811
When grandpa moved us
from California

390
00:20:14,879 --> 00:20:17,047
For a job he just
couldn't pass up.

391
00:20:17,082 --> 00:20:20,283
We didn't have
a penny to our name.

392
00:20:20,318 --> 00:20:22,719
But we had the world
in front of us.

393
00:20:22,787 --> 00:20:25,155
And those trees.

394
00:20:25,223 --> 00:20:29,193
They were like
a row of soldiers
welcoming us home.

395
00:20:29,260 --> 00:20:32,028
What did you leave
back in California?

396
00:20:32,096 --> 00:20:33,530
Everything.

397
00:20:33,598 --> 00:20:37,100
My parents,
my baby brother,
you name it.

398
00:20:37,202 --> 00:20:39,402
What happened with
your little brother?

399
00:20:39,537 --> 00:20:42,339
We'll have plenty
of time for that.

400
00:20:46,210 --> 00:20:49,146
If I'm not mistaken,
this should be it.

401
00:21:02,294 --> 00:21:04,627
Ella: What happened
to the trees?

402
00:21:04,696 --> 00:21:06,930
This is it.

403
00:21:06,998 --> 00:21:08,499
Grandma,
this is stupid.

404
00:21:08,566 --> 00:21:11,068
We can just barge in
on some strangers.

405
00:21:11,136 --> 00:21:13,103
It'll be fine.

406
00:21:13,171 --> 00:21:14,738
People are nicer
than you think.

407
00:21:16,474 --> 00:21:17,941
I'll do the talking.

408
00:21:18,009 --> 00:21:19,910
Good, 'cause I don't
want to be here.

Who are you?

413
00:21:30,821 --> 00:21:34,190
Is your mother
or father home?

Mom?!

415
00:21:36,461 --> 00:21:39,596
Two strange ladies
are here!

00:21:39,664 --> 00:21:40,931
That's a good start.

Can I help you?
Hi.

419
00:21:47,105 --> 00:21:49,239
My name is Annie Eason,

420
00:21:49,307 --> 00:21:51,341
And this is
my granddaughter Ella.

421
00:21:51,443 --> 00:21:52,709
Can I help you?

422
00:21:52,777 --> 00:21:55,178
I know this is gonna
sound unusual, but...

423
00:21:55,280 --> 00:21:58,615
My husband and I
built this house
years ago,

424
00:21:58,682 --> 00:22:02,619
And I was wondering
if it would be possible...

425
00:22:02,687 --> 00:22:05,122
For me to have
a look inside.

426
00:22:05,189 --> 00:22:07,890
We should be going.
Sorry to bother you.

427
00:22:07,958 --> 00:22:09,993
You see,
we left something

428
00:22:10,060 --> 00:22:12,795
Behind the nook
in the kitchen, for luck.

429
00:22:12,863 --> 00:22:14,864
Would it be all right
for me to see

430
00:22:14,932 --> 00:22:16,766
If it's still there?

431
00:22:16,834 --> 00:22:18,468
I don't know.

Mrs. Hogan...
My granddaughter and I

433
00:22:20,572 --> 00:22:22,905
Are on a Journey
across the country,

434
00:22:22,941 --> 00:22:24,975
And I have
a heart problem.

435
00:22:25,043 --> 00:22:29,179
So I figured we could
use all the luck
we could get.

436
00:22:29,246 --> 00:22:31,915
We built the house
in 1960.

437
00:22:31,982 --> 00:22:34,117
How long have you
been living here?

Um, five years
this July.

I hope you don't
mind my asking--

441
00:22:42,327 --> 00:22:45,195
What happened
to those beautiful
trees out front?

442
00:22:45,262 --> 00:22:47,631
This is how the house
came to us.

443
00:22:57,008 --> 00:22:59,910
Are--are you sure
you know what
you're looking for?

444
00:23:00,011 --> 00:23:01,744
Annie: I'm sure.

445
00:23:07,852 --> 00:23:09,453
Mrs. Hogan:
Oh, my goodness.

00:23:09,520 --> 00:23:10,987
Ella: What is that?

447
00:23:11,055 --> 00:23:14,391
Annie: A 1919
gold Liberty coin...

448
00:23:14,459 --> 00:23:18,094
Given to your grandfather
by his father.

449
00:23:18,162 --> 00:23:20,564
When we left California,
he said,

450
00:23:20,631 --> 00:23:23,266
"hide it someplace
in your first home,

451
00:23:23,334 --> 00:23:25,802
And it'll bring you
a lifetime of happiness."

452
00:23:25,870 --> 00:23:28,238
We call it lucky 19.

453
00:23:28,305 --> 00:23:31,241
Just before he passed,
your grandfather said

454
00:23:31,308 --> 00:23:35,612
He realized this coin
needed to come back
to the family.

455
00:23:35,713 --> 00:23:40,183
Houses don't need luck.
People do.

456
00:23:45,289 --> 00:23:47,257
Margaret, I cannot
thank you enough

457
00:23:47,324 --> 00:23:48,859
For allowing us
in your home.

to have this.

It sure is.

463
00:24:09,514 --> 00:24:11,881
There used to be
trees here.

464
00:24:11,983 --> 00:24:14,084
It was so beautiful.

465
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,120
I can't accept this.

466
00:24:17,188 --> 00:24:18,989
Oh, it would mean
a great deal to me

467
00:24:19,056 --> 00:24:22,259
If you could use
some of that money to
plant some new trees.

468
00:24:22,326 --> 00:24:23,927
I can't.

gave her all that money.

when we were younger.

00:35:22,753 --> 00:35:26,121
Ella, I'm making it
to Annie's point,
with or without you.

706
00:35:26,223 --> 00:35:27,256
If you want to come
with me,

707
00:35:27,323 --> 00:35:29,025
You're gonna have to
play by my rules.

708
00:35:33,530 --> 00:35:35,198
Woman: Could you
please pick up?

709
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,166
This is important.
Pick up for one sec.

710
00:35:37,234 --> 00:35:39,768
Brenda,
something's come up.
I have to leave town.

711
00:35:39,836 --> 00:35:41,471
I'm gonna have both
cell phones with me.

712
00:35:41,538 --> 00:35:42,605
But don't use
the personal number

713
00:35:42,672 --> 00:35:43,973
Unless you
absolutely have to,

714
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,208
And transfer all
my business calls

715
00:35:45,276 --> 00:35:46,743
To the business
number. Got it?

716
00:35:46,810 --> 00:35:48,111
Honey, I've been here
for eight years.

717
00:35:48,178 --> 00:35:50,079
I think I've got it.
Where are you going?

718
00:35:50,147 --> 00:35:51,981
I'm not quite sure.
But I need you to
do me another favor.

719
00:35:52,049 --> 00:35:53,415
Could you find out
where the last place

720
00:35:53,483 --> 00:35:55,051
That credit card
number was used?

721
00:35:55,085 --> 00:35:56,619
And you've got to call
Backis and Weller

722
00:35:56,686 --> 00:35:58,620
And tell them I can't
make today's appointment.

723
00:35:58,688 --> 00:36:00,222
You can tell them
yourself.

724
00:36:00,290 --> 00:36:01,958
I was trying to tell you--
they're here early.

725
00:36:03,928 --> 00:36:05,861
Man: I've been here
a lot longer than I planned,

726
00:36:05,930 --> 00:36:08,231
But I want those contracts
on my desk by 4:00.

727
00:36:10,934 --> 00:36:12,935
[Sighs]

728
00:36:13,003 --> 00:36:14,470
Mr. Backis.

729
00:36:14,505 --> 00:36:16,339
Mr. Weller,
I am terribly sorry.

730
00:36:16,406 --> 00:36:18,207
But we're gonna have to
postpone today's meeting.

731
00:36:18,275 --> 00:36:19,842
Something's come up,
and I have to leave town.

732
00:36:19,909 --> 00:36:21,610
Richard, let me
level with you.

733
00:36:21,678 --> 00:36:23,346
Eason's line of credit

734
00:36:23,413 --> 00:36:26,182
Is what we call
in the banking industry
"guarded".

735
00:36:26,249 --> 00:36:28,717
Well, I'll take that
into consideration.

736
00:36:28,785 --> 00:36:30,386
Now, if you'd like to
make a new appointment,

737
00:36:30,454 --> 00:36:31,787
You can do that
with my assistant.

738
00:36:31,855 --> 00:36:35,024
And, again, my apologies
for the inconvenience.

739
00:36:35,092 --> 00:36:38,427
Uh, Mr. Eason? Are you
still going out of town?

740
00:36:38,429 --> 00:36:40,696
Absolutely.

741
00:36:48,405 --> 00:36:51,273
You gonna stay mad at me
the entire trip?

742
00:36:54,711 --> 00:36:57,880
I can go longer than
you can without talking.

743
00:36:57,948 --> 00:37:00,049
We'll start right now.

744
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:02,151
No one is talking.

745
00:37:02,219 --> 00:37:04,586
Over 1,000 Miles to go,

746
00:37:04,655 --> 00:37:06,989
And no one is talking.

747
00:37:07,091 --> 00:37:08,424
Oh, we're smiling now.

748
00:37:08,492 --> 00:37:10,059
But no one is talking.

749
00:37:10,126 --> 00:37:12,829
You couldn't go
five minutes
without talking.

750
00:37:12,896 --> 00:37:14,697
And you can't
stay mad at me.

751
00:37:16,599 --> 00:37:19,735
I'm sorry I raised
my voice back there, but...

752
00:37:19,803 --> 00:37:22,171
This trip is
more important to me

753
00:37:22,238 --> 00:37:24,874
Than I can truly
put into words.

754
00:37:24,942 --> 00:37:27,376
Do you understand?

755
00:37:30,648 --> 00:37:32,814
I'm getting hungry.

756
00:37:38,689 --> 00:37:41,423
Park the car.
I have an idea.

757
00:37:55,405 --> 00:37:57,707
Ok, what's
your big idea?

758
00:37:57,774 --> 00:37:59,441
I'll take your arm,

759
00:37:59,509 --> 00:38:02,745
And you tell them
I'm a blind
caricature artist.

760
00:38:02,813 --> 00:38:05,181
What?! No way.
That's crazy.

761
00:38:05,248 --> 00:38:07,483
You want
to eat tonight?

762
00:38:10,420 --> 00:38:12,588
Ok,
watch your step.

763
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:23,265
Hi. Lovely day
for a fair, isn't it?

764
00:38:23,333 --> 00:38:25,267
Oh, it sure is, sir.

765
00:38:25,335 --> 00:38:28,037
Oh. She doesn't
see too well.

766
00:38:28,105 --> 00:38:31,140
Or... Really at all.

767
00:38:31,208 --> 00:38:32,742
Excuse me.

768
00:38:32,809 --> 00:38:34,076
Could I...

769
00:38:36,779 --> 00:38:37,980
Oh.

770
00:38:38,047 --> 00:38:40,048
From the contours
of your face,

771
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:42,251
I'd say you were Irish.

772
00:38:42,319 --> 00:38:43,685
That's right.

773
00:38:43,753 --> 00:38:45,254
How do you do that?

774
00:38:45,322 --> 00:38:46,455
Ok, grandma.

775
00:38:46,523 --> 00:38:49,358
There's no entrance fee
for this,

776
00:38:49,426 --> 00:38:53,061
But we do request
a $5 donation, please.

777
00:38:53,130 --> 00:38:55,130
Oh, we're not here
to shop.

778
00:38:55,198 --> 00:38:57,232
I'm an artist.

779
00:38:59,369 --> 00:39:01,971
She does caricatures.

780
00:39:02,038 --> 00:39:04,006
But... But...

781
00:39:04,074 --> 00:39:05,741
She can't see.

782
00:39:05,776 --> 00:39:07,710
But that's
the beauty of it.

783
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,583
[Overlapping chatter
and laughter]

784
00:39:33,303 --> 00:39:35,570
Here you are, son.
Thanks.

785
00:39:35,639 --> 00:39:36,839
Man: That's amazing.

786
00:39:36,907 --> 00:39:39,308
Oh, you don't know
the half of it.

787
00:39:40,877 --> 00:39:42,878
Thank you.

788
00:39:42,946 --> 00:39:45,247
How many is that?
16.

789
00:39:45,349 --> 00:39:47,383
Who's next?

790
00:40:08,038 --> 00:40:09,605
Ella bear...

791
00:40:09,673 --> 00:40:12,708
That voice of yours
is really something.

792
00:40:14,611 --> 00:40:16,412
That was the first time
I sang for anybody

793
00:40:16,479 --> 00:40:17,879
Besides my mom.

794
00:40:17,947 --> 00:40:20,649
Have you written
any songs for her?

795
00:40:20,717 --> 00:40:24,553
Actually, that's
what I'm working on
right now.

796
00:40:24,555 --> 00:40:25,921
Does it help?

797
00:40:27,991 --> 00:40:29,425
With what?

798
00:40:29,493 --> 00:40:32,594
Does it help you...
You know...

799
00:40:32,662 --> 00:40:35,731
When you're feeling
down about her?

800
00:40:35,799 --> 00:40:37,399
I don't know.

801
00:40:37,467 --> 00:40:39,334
You know what I do

802
00:40:39,403 --> 00:40:41,570
When I'm especially blue
about grandpa?

803
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,706
I talk to him.

804
00:40:43,807 --> 00:40:45,107
Yeah, I--

805
00:40:45,175 --> 00:40:47,009
I heard you
in the car.

806
00:40:47,077 --> 00:40:49,244
I'm not embarrassed. I--

807
00:40:49,312 --> 00:40:52,448
Sometimes I talk
about normal stuff--

808
00:40:52,515 --> 00:40:54,283
My day...

809
00:40:54,350 --> 00:40:56,385
My feelings.

810
00:40:58,655 --> 00:41:00,756
Does it help?

811
00:41:00,824 --> 00:41:02,224
Sometimes.

812
00:41:03,827 --> 00:41:06,495
It makes me feel like
he's still with me.

813
00:41:14,137 --> 00:41:15,604
Richard: Yes,
I'm aware of the fact

814
00:41:15,672 --> 00:41:17,139
That they're not
technically missing.

815
00:41:17,207 --> 00:41:18,640
I have their
itinerary with me.

816
00:41:18,708 --> 00:41:20,342
<i>Man: Sir, they're</i>
<i>adults, not kids.</i>

817
00:41:20,410 --> 00:41:23,112
Yes, I'm aware of
the fact that they're
too old to be runaways.

818
00:41:23,179 --> 00:41:24,413
<i>Well, we don't</i>
<i>have the authority--</i>

819
00:41:24,480 --> 00:41:25,714
What do you
suggest we do?

820
00:41:25,782 --> 00:41:27,849
Wait until they break
the law or something?

821
00:41:27,918 --> 00:41:29,184
<i>Let's hope it doesn't</i>
<i>come to that.</i>

822
00:41:29,252 --> 00:41:31,320
Ok, thank you.
Thank you very much.

823
00:41:31,388 --> 00:41:33,688
Same to you. Good-bye.

824
00:41:37,761 --> 00:41:39,862
[Cell phone rings]

825
00:41:41,297 --> 00:41:43,165
Hey, Brenda.
What did you find out?

826
00:41:43,233 --> 00:41:45,534
<i>The card was last</i>
<i>used in Missouri.</i>
Missouri?!

827
00:41:45,602 --> 00:41:47,369
Did Mr. Nucci call
to harass me, too?

828
00:41:47,437 --> 00:41:49,705
Would you do me
a favor and get him
on the line, please?

829
00:41:49,772 --> 00:41:52,208
<i>Don't forget to eat.</i>
Thank you. What?

830
00:41:52,275 --> 00:41:53,476
<i>I said,</i>
<i>don't forget to eat.</i>

831
00:41:53,543 --> 00:41:55,877
Yes. Yes, I'll remember
to eat something.

832
00:41:55,945 --> 00:41:57,413
<i>Ok.</i>
Ok.

833
00:41:57,481 --> 00:41:59,482
<i>Ok. 'Cause you</i>
<i>know what, sweetheart?</i>

834
00:41:59,549 --> 00:42:01,116
<i>You are like a toothpick.</i>
<i>I mean, personally,</i>

835
00:42:01,184 --> 00:42:03,319
<i>I like a man with</i>
<i>a little more meat</i>
<i>on his bones.</i>

836
00:42:03,387 --> 00:42:04,486
Annie:
Did you know,

837
00:42:04,554 --> 00:42:06,188
After all those years
of painting,

838
00:42:06,256 --> 00:42:09,592
Today was the first time
I've ever actually
sold something?

839
00:42:09,660 --> 00:42:11,127
Really?

840
00:42:12,528 --> 00:42:14,096
I think we've done
quite a bit of living

841
00:42:14,163 --> 00:42:15,998
In the last
couple of days.

842
00:42:16,065 --> 00:42:19,135
How are you feeling?

843
00:42:19,136 --> 00:42:20,602
I'm feeling
the same as I was

844
00:42:20,670 --> 00:42:23,172
When you asked me
ten minutes ago.

845
00:42:23,239 --> 00:42:25,007
That's why
I have these.

846
00:42:28,745 --> 00:42:31,714
How did you know
grandpa was the one?

847
00:42:33,951 --> 00:42:35,818
He touched my hand.

848
00:42:36,153 --> 00:42:37,185
And?

849
00:42:37,321 --> 00:42:38,987
Ella bear...

850
00:42:39,055 --> 00:42:42,058
When your grandpa
touched my hand
for the first time,

851
00:42:42,125 --> 00:42:44,060
I had to
actually look down

852
00:42:44,094 --> 00:42:45,427
To see if it was
still there.

853
00:42:45,529 --> 00:42:48,196
I knew right then.

854
00:42:48,264 --> 00:42:50,232
That's it?

855
00:42:50,300 --> 00:42:54,269
That sounds like
something out of
a cheesy romance novel.

856
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:56,438
I know it sounds silly.

857
00:42:56,540 --> 00:42:58,273
Someday you'll know
what I mean.

858
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:04,079
So, tell me
about your brother.

859
00:43:04,147 --> 00:43:05,915
How did we
get to that?

860
00:43:05,982 --> 00:43:07,750
I don't know.
I mean...

861
00:43:07,817 --> 00:43:10,285
These are all
the things that
I don't know about you.

862
00:43:10,387 --> 00:43:12,921
There isn't
much to tell.

863
00:43:12,989 --> 00:43:15,457
Ok, I sang
at that truck stop,

864
00:43:15,525 --> 00:43:17,826
And I showed you
my notebook.

865
00:43:17,861 --> 00:43:19,895
Now it's time for you
to do something that
you don't want to do.

866
00:43:19,963 --> 00:43:22,631
Well...

867
00:43:22,699 --> 00:43:25,701
Doug is almost 20 years
younger than I am,

868
00:43:25,768 --> 00:43:27,737
And he lives
in California.

869
00:43:27,804 --> 00:43:29,338
Why don't you
talk to him?

870
00:43:29,406 --> 00:43:31,173
It's a long story.

871
00:43:31,240 --> 00:43:34,443
I wanted to teach him
a lesson years ago.

872
00:43:34,511 --> 00:43:37,780
I think he got the lesson,
but he never forgave me.

873
00:43:40,116 --> 00:43:42,451
Have you ever been
skinny-dipping?

874
00:43:42,518 --> 00:43:43,819
No.

875
00:43:43,887 --> 00:43:45,220
I keep thinking about
that pool

876
00:43:45,288 --> 00:43:49,291
By that big country club
when we were driving in here.

877
00:43:49,359 --> 00:43:51,894
Why don't we chalk up
another first while
we're on the road?

878
00:43:51,995 --> 00:43:53,762
What do you say?

879
00:43:53,864 --> 00:43:55,097
No.
Why not?

880
00:43:55,165 --> 00:43:59,602
Because you're sick,
and, no offense,

881
00:43:59,669 --> 00:44:03,005
But the idea
of skinny-dipping
with my grandma

882
00:44:03,073 --> 00:44:05,875
Doesn't sound like
a whole lot of fun.

883
00:44:05,942 --> 00:44:08,244
It actually sounds
kind of creepy.

884
00:44:08,311 --> 00:44:10,446
Well, I'm going
skinny-dipping.

885
00:44:23,960 --> 00:44:25,661
Are you sure
you want to do this?

886
00:44:25,728 --> 00:44:27,763
You only live once.

887
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:37,038
I don't know if I can
make it over the fence.

888
00:44:40,042 --> 00:44:41,810
How did you
get over there?

889
00:44:41,845 --> 00:44:43,478
The gate's open.

890
00:44:46,115 --> 00:44:47,716
That works.

891
00:44:49,385 --> 00:44:51,119
Ella:
How's the temperature?

892
00:44:51,187 --> 00:44:52,754
Annie: Who cares?

893
00:45:01,064 --> 00:45:04,867
Oh, it's beautiful
in here!

894
00:45:04,935 --> 00:45:06,302
You didn't
finish your story.

895
00:45:06,369 --> 00:45:07,669
Tell me about
your brother.

896
00:45:07,737 --> 00:45:10,806
Doug was living with us

897
00:45:10,874 --> 00:45:13,075
After my folks passed.

898
00:45:13,176 --> 00:45:17,245
He didn't deal with
their passing all that well.

899
00:45:17,280 --> 00:45:20,849
He was good kid,
but for a while there,

900
00:45:20,851 --> 00:45:24,019
He always seemed
to find trouble.

901
00:45:24,087 --> 00:45:26,121
One night he got
caught shoplifting,

902
00:45:26,189 --> 00:45:28,023
And they arrested him.

903
00:45:28,091 --> 00:45:30,425
I thought he should spend
one night in jail

904
00:45:30,493 --> 00:45:32,227
Before we got him out.

905
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,963
Like I said,
to teach him a lesson.

906
00:45:35,031 --> 00:45:36,298
When we finally
got him out,

907
00:45:36,366 --> 00:45:38,700
He was awfully
mad at me.

908
00:45:38,802 --> 00:45:41,403
We got into
a huge fight,

909
00:45:41,470 --> 00:45:45,574
Said things I'm sure
we both regretted
our whole lives.

910
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,010
Then he packed
his bags,

911
00:45:48,077 --> 00:45:49,511
Moved to California,

912
00:45:49,579 --> 00:45:51,046
And I never heard
from him again.

913
00:45:51,113 --> 00:45:53,214
Ella: What happened
to him?

914
00:45:53,282 --> 00:45:55,617
Like I said,
he was a good kid.

915
00:45:55,685 --> 00:46:00,889
He learned his lesson
and just... Lived his life.

916
00:46:00,957 --> 00:46:02,791
Why don't we stop
and see him?

917
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,659
Doug?

918
00:46:04,727 --> 00:46:06,862
I wouldn't know
what to say.

[Police siren whooping]

920
00:46:10,333 --> 00:46:12,634
Oh, poo!

921

Man: Yes, officer.

922
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:16,371
We are always having
trespassers.

923
00:46:16,439 --> 00:46:18,440
This is not a public pool,
you understand.

924
00:46:18,508 --> 00:46:21,677
I understand, sir.
I'll take care of it.

925
00:46:21,678 --> 00:46:23,512
I thank you.
Mm-hmm.

926
00:46:25,248 --> 00:46:27,982
Uh, well, um...

927
00:46:28,050 --> 00:46:31,986
That gentleman there--
that's Mr. Langelos.

928
00:46:31,988 --> 00:46:34,089
Annie: Does he live
at the country club?

929
00:46:34,157 --> 00:46:36,926
Uh, heh. Ma'am...
This isn't a country club.

930
00:46:36,993 --> 00:46:38,860
It's his private
residence.

931
00:46:38,895 --> 00:46:41,964
Oh, my.

932
00:46:42,031 --> 00:46:44,466
My partner here will
drive your car behind me,

933
00:46:44,534 --> 00:46:46,535
Save you a $100
impound fee.

934
00:46:46,603 --> 00:46:49,438
Thank you.
Sure.

935
00:46:53,709 --> 00:46:55,177
Officer: Just, uh,
come this way.

936
00:46:55,245 --> 00:46:56,411
Thank you.

938
00:47:00,650 --> 00:47:02,317

Annie: One day we'll
look back on this

942
00:47:32,248 --> 00:47:34,482
As our
"night in jail".

943
00:47:34,550 --> 00:47:35,951
[Chuckles]

944
00:47:36,019 --> 00:47:38,420
Boy, Doug would
find this a real hoot.

945
00:47:38,487 --> 00:47:40,755
His goodie-goodie
sister in the can.

946
00:47:40,824 --> 00:47:42,324
Grandma,
this isn't funny!

947
00:47:42,391 --> 00:47:44,592
God, don't you take
anything seriously?

948
00:47:44,661 --> 00:47:45,794
Oh, we'll be
out of here in no time.

949
00:47:45,862 --> 00:47:48,330
We don't have money
for the fine.

950
00:47:48,331 --> 00:47:49,598
We're gonna have to
call dad.

951
00:47:49,666 --> 00:47:51,333
I'm sure he'll be
joining us

952
00:47:51,401 --> 00:47:53,669
Sooner rather
than later.

953
00:47:57,239 --> 00:48:00,842
Uh, you sure there isn't
anyone you'd like to call?

954
00:48:00,910 --> 00:48:02,977
Uh, in a moment, son.

955
00:48:03,045 --> 00:48:06,114
Right now...
Would you mind

956
00:48:06,182 --> 00:48:08,550
Pointing me to that
bathroom over there?

Oh, call me Annie.

959

Annie. That's really just
for police personnel only.

960
00:48:16,625 --> 00:48:21,730
Now, you wouldn't want
your mother using that,
would you?

961
00:48:23,266 --> 00:48:24,900
Uh, no, ma'am.

962
00:48:24,968 --> 00:48:28,336
Could you find it
in your heart to...

963

Treat me like
your mother?
Just this time?

964

Uh...

965
00:48:37,180 --> 00:48:38,547

Oh, he's out
on a call.

Would you be a dear...

971
00:48:50,894 --> 00:48:52,727
And make sure
it's clean?

972
00:48:52,795 --> 00:48:54,229
I have a thing
about bathrooms.

973
00:48:54,297 --> 00:48:55,530
Sure.

to me, Annie.

Thelma and Louise.

go to jail.

been to jail.

No, I mean,

and murderers.

caught, grandma.

How am I supposed
to relax?

991
00:49:37,374 --> 00:49:40,142
You guilted me into
going on this trip
with you.

992
00:49:40,209 --> 00:49:42,110
You--you lied
and told me

993
00:49:42,178 --> 00:49:43,945
You need some kind
of heart surgery.

994
00:49:44,013 --> 00:49:46,214
And then you broke us
out of jail.

995
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:48,616
You don't need me on
this trip with you.

996
00:49:48,651 --> 00:49:49,818
You just need
a chauffeur.

997
00:49:49,886 --> 00:49:51,787
That's not true.
Oh, yeah?

998

Well, that's how
I see it.

You're going through
a very hard time,

the light at the end
of the tunnel.

But trust me.
Trust yourself.

a chauffeur,

I need a best friend.

in rand junction.
Who is this?

1054
00:52:28,444 --> 00:52:30,278
This is Richard Eason.
Is everything all right?

1055
00:52:30,380 --> 00:52:33,782
You wouldn't know
Annie and Ella Eason,
would you?

1056
00:52:33,850 --> 00:52:36,818
Yes, that's my mother
and my daughter.

1057
00:52:36,886 --> 00:52:38,687
Are they all ri--

1058
00:52:38,755 --> 00:52:41,122
[sighs]
what have they done?

1059
00:52:41,224 --> 00:52:42,924
Why don't I tell you
where I'm at,

1060
00:52:42,992 --> 00:52:46,027
And we can talk
in person?

1061
00:52:46,129 --> 00:52:48,463
You're not from here,
are you?

1062
00:52:48,530 --> 00:52:50,398
It's the clothes,
isn't it?

1063
00:52:50,466 --> 00:52:52,701
Your car's Illinois
license plates.

1064
00:52:52,768 --> 00:52:55,269
I saw you drive up.

1065
00:52:58,741 --> 00:53:00,809
How long are you
and your mom in town for?

1066
00:53:00,877 --> 00:53:02,777
Oh, that's
my grandmother.

1067
00:53:02,845 --> 00:53:05,079
We're just...
Passing through.

1068
00:53:05,114 --> 00:53:07,816
I'm sorry. I didn't
even introduce myself.

1069
00:53:07,884 --> 00:53:09,317
I'm Scott tardy.

1070
00:53:09,352 --> 00:53:11,153
Oh, uh...
[chimes ringing]

1071
00:53:11,220 --> 00:53:12,854
Ella Eason.

1072
00:53:12,921 --> 00:53:13,955
Very nice to
meet you, Ella.

1073
00:53:14,023 --> 00:53:15,690
You, too.

1074
00:53:15,758 --> 00:53:18,694
If, uh...
You're staying in town,

1075
00:53:18,761 --> 00:53:21,496
And if you and your
grandmother want
something different to do,

1076
00:53:21,598 --> 00:53:25,233
It's open-Mike night tonight.
It's pretty popular.

1077
00:53:25,234 --> 00:53:27,302
Ok, I'll ask her.

1078
00:53:27,337 --> 00:53:28,837
Ask me what?

1079
00:53:28,904 --> 00:53:31,873
I thought maybe we
could come back later

1080
00:53:31,941 --> 00:53:34,009
For some coffee.

1081
00:53:34,076 --> 00:53:35,343
Oh, I'm sorry, Scott.

1082
00:53:35,410 --> 00:53:37,211
This is my grandmother
Annie.

1083
00:53:37,279 --> 00:53:38,947
I told Ella
it's open-Mike night,

1084
00:53:39,015 --> 00:53:40,381
And we get some
pretty good singers.

1085
00:53:40,449 --> 00:53:42,884
Ella has the voice
of an Angel.
Grandma.

1086
00:53:42,952 --> 00:53:44,552
You didn't tell me
you could sing.

1087
00:53:44,620 --> 00:53:45,887
Annie:
I'm not surprised.

1088
00:53:45,955 --> 00:53:47,421
Would you sing
for us tonight?

1089
00:53:47,523 --> 00:53:49,123
No--
she'd love to.

1090
00:53:49,191 --> 00:53:51,760
Great. I'll see you
tonight.

1091
00:53:53,128 --> 00:53:55,230
What did you
do that for?

1092
00:53:55,297 --> 00:53:58,633
You have to sing
sometime.

1093
00:53:58,701 --> 00:53:59,867
[Sighs]

1094
00:53:59,935 --> 00:54:02,570
He is so cute. Heh.

1095
00:54:02,638 --> 00:54:04,705
And you thought you didn't
know how to flirt.

1096
00:54:04,773 --> 00:54:06,707
Come on.

1097
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:14,315
Richard: Listen, I can't
apologize enough for this.

1098
00:54:14,350 --> 00:54:15,650
It's all right.

1099
00:54:15,718 --> 00:54:17,819
It turns out the charges
were dropped.

1100
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:20,054
They were?
Yeah.

1101
00:54:20,122 --> 00:54:23,291
It seems that,
uh, Mr. Langelos

1102
00:54:23,359 --> 00:54:25,159
Was a little taken
with your mother.

1103
00:54:25,228 --> 00:54:27,629
Ah, she was
skinny-dipping,
you know.

1104
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:29,431
I mean, of course
I was, uh--

1105
00:54:29,498 --> 00:54:31,566
I was fixing
to let them go
before the escape.

1106
00:54:31,634 --> 00:54:33,401
Now, if this were
to get out,

1107
00:54:33,469 --> 00:54:36,104
I would be the butt
of all the jokes
in town.

1108
00:54:36,139 --> 00:54:39,541
So, uh... I'd just
as soon keep this
between us.

1109
00:54:41,777 --> 00:54:43,778
Well, I'd
appreciate that, too.

1110
00:54:43,845 --> 00:54:45,113
Thanks very much.

1111
00:54:45,181 --> 00:54:47,549
Have a safe trip.
Ok.

1112
00:54:48,750 --> 00:54:51,519
She really was?
Skinny-dipping?

1113
00:54:51,587 --> 00:54:53,588
Buck naked.

1114
00:54:54,856 --> 00:54:56,291
[Laughs]

1115
00:54:59,761 --> 00:55:01,630
Richard: Brenda, did you
get the email I sent?

1116
00:55:01,697 --> 00:55:02,897
<i>Brenda: Yes.</i>

1117
00:55:02,965 --> 00:55:04,399
And you passed
the schedule and figures

1118
00:55:04,466 --> 00:55:06,000
On to Backis, Weller
and Nucci?

1119
00:55:06,068 --> 00:55:08,035
<i>Yep.</i>
Ok, then.

1120
00:55:08,103 --> 00:55:09,638
I don't know what else
I can do for them.

1121
00:55:09,705 --> 00:55:11,440
<i>Mm-hmm.</i>
If they call again,

1122
00:55:11,507 --> 00:55:13,241
Tell them I've sent
everything they need

1123
00:55:13,309 --> 00:55:14,810
To keep the project
going forward.

1124
00:55:14,877 --> 00:55:16,144
<i>Ok.</i>

1125
00:55:16,212 --> 00:55:17,412

to track down

mother and daughter.

You both look
lovely tonight.

Thank you.
Thank you.

1135
00:55:50,379 --> 00:55:52,414
I saved you a table,
just in case.

1136
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,519
Scott: The coffee's on me.

1137
00:55:57,587 --> 00:56:00,154
Ella, you go on
in 20 minutes.

1138
00:56:00,222 --> 00:56:01,923
I can't wait
to hear you sing.

1139
00:56:01,958 --> 00:56:03,191
Annie: Me, either.

1140
00:56:03,259 --> 00:56:04,759
Me, either.

1141
00:56:07,763 --> 00:56:10,332
Somebody has
a crush on you.

1142
00:56:10,399 --> 00:56:13,634
Yeah, well, he won't
after I vomit all over
his stage.

1143
00:56:13,702 --> 00:56:15,937
You're gonna be great.

tonight.

1149

We have a treat for you.

1150
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:39,661
Do you remember
what I told you

1151
00:56:39,729 --> 00:56:41,363
About how I talk
to grandpa?

1152
00:56:42,931 --> 00:56:44,366
Now, close your eyes.

1153
00:56:44,433 --> 00:56:46,200
Go sing this
for your mama.

1154
00:56:46,268 --> 00:56:48,503
Please welcome... Ella.

for about an hour.

1228
01:01:48,370 --> 01:01:50,438
There's not much to it.

1229
01:01:50,505 --> 01:01:52,373
Annie: There will be.

1230
01:01:52,441 --> 01:01:54,775
What do you mean?

1231
01:01:54,844 --> 01:01:56,544
You'll see.

1232
01:02:01,516 --> 01:02:03,517
Ella: Wow!
This is amazing!

1233
01:02:03,585 --> 01:02:07,455
It sure is.
It's changed quite a bit

1234
01:02:07,522 --> 01:02:10,258
Since your grandpa
and I were here.

1235
01:02:10,326 --> 01:02:12,327
We'll pull in here.

1236
01:02:12,394 --> 01:02:14,262
Are you sure?

1237
01:02:14,363 --> 01:02:16,531
Positive.

1238

1241
01:02:24,272 --> 01:02:25,640
Ok, I'll call dad.

1242

Not yet.
I feel lucky.

1243
01:02:27,776 --> 01:02:29,544
You want to gamble?

1244
01:02:29,612 --> 01:02:31,712
I'd rather do that than
give in to your father.

1245
01:02:31,781 --> 01:02:33,614
Gramm, we don't
have any money,

1246
01:02:33,682 --> 01:02:36,985

we're probably
wanted fugitives,

out of medication.

suggest we do?

1249
01:02:42,490 --> 01:02:44,258
No.

1250
01:02:44,325 --> 01:02:46,126
Grandpa's father
gave it to him

1251
01:02:46,194 --> 01:02:49,329
To bring him luck when
he needed it most.

1252
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:50,898
But it's your
lucky coin.

1254

No, that's crazy.

1255

a thousand times.

forgiven myself.

01:11:09,564 --> 01:11:11,332
And he dropped
all the charges.

1404
01:11:11,400 --> 01:11:12,966
He was so embarrassed

1405
01:11:13,035 --> 01:11:14,835
That an older woman locked
him in his own cell.

1406
01:11:14,903 --> 01:11:17,038
He's not gonna tell
anybody anything.

1407
01:11:17,105 --> 01:11:19,840
So, how long have you
and aunt Annie been driving?

1408
01:11:19,908 --> 01:11:22,276
About three days.

1409
01:11:22,344 --> 01:11:24,311
Who would think
it'd be fun to drive
across country

1410
01:11:24,379 --> 01:11:26,313
With their grandma?

1411
01:11:26,381 --> 01:11:29,250
I gotta tell you,
when she and I first
got in the car...

1412
01:11:29,317 --> 01:11:31,352
I would've rather
been anywhere else.

1413
01:11:31,420 --> 01:11:34,055
I mean, I never thought
that my grandma

1414
01:11:34,122 --> 01:11:36,123
Could understand
anything

1415
01:11:36,191 --> 01:11:38,426
That was going on
in my world.

1416
01:11:38,460 --> 01:11:40,327
And?

1417
01:11:40,395 --> 01:11:42,196
She taught me more
in a few days

1418
01:11:42,264 --> 01:11:44,631
Than I ever would've
learned in school.

1419
01:11:44,699 --> 01:11:46,300
You're in college?

1420
01:11:46,368 --> 01:11:47,601
I was.

1421
01:11:47,668 --> 01:11:48,969
Well, what happened?

1422
01:11:49,037 --> 01:11:50,905
I left.

1423
01:11:50,972 --> 01:11:53,473
So, you just quit?

1424
01:11:53,541 --> 01:11:57,211
Well, my music never
would've had a Chance
if I didn't.

1425
01:11:59,180 --> 01:12:01,282
What do <i>you</i>
want to be?

1426
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:03,150
A writer.

1427
01:12:03,185 --> 01:12:04,952
That's awesome.

1428
01:12:05,019 --> 01:12:07,654
It would be awesome
to actually have
a book published.

1429
01:12:07,722 --> 01:12:10,324
A wise woman
once told me

1430
01:12:10,391 --> 01:12:14,060
That the world is open
to all of our dreams.

1431
01:12:14,129 --> 01:12:16,497
And what if they're
just dreams?

1432
01:12:16,564 --> 01:12:19,099
Well, you won't know
until you try.

1433
01:12:19,134 --> 01:12:21,468
You gotta do
what makes you happy.

1434
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:30,444
[Grunts]

1435
01:12:50,265 --> 01:12:52,032
Here's some
water, Annie.

1436
01:12:52,100 --> 01:12:53,567
Oh.

1437
01:12:57,539 --> 01:12:59,006
Thank you.

1438
01:12:59,073 --> 01:13:00,441
Those are
some big pills.

1439
01:13:00,509 --> 01:13:02,976
What are those for?

1440
01:13:03,044 --> 01:13:05,513
I'm just getting old.
[Chuckles]

1441
01:13:05,580 --> 01:13:07,447
Are you all right?
Oh, I'm fine.

1442
01:13:07,516 --> 01:13:09,884
It's been
a long Journey.

1443
01:13:09,951 --> 01:13:11,552
Nothing a good
night's sleep

1444
01:13:11,620 --> 01:13:14,521
And comfortable bed
won't fix. Ha ha!

1445
01:13:14,589 --> 01:13:17,391
Oh, it's really good
to see you, Doug.

1446
01:13:17,459 --> 01:13:18,758
Same here.

1447
01:13:18,826 --> 01:13:20,560
Now, you're sure
you're all right?

1448
01:13:20,628 --> 01:13:21,862
Oh, I'm fine.

1449
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,464
'Cause I'm right next door
if you need me.

1450
01:13:23,531 --> 01:13:25,366
Fine.

1451
01:13:27,135 --> 01:13:28,768
Good night, Annie.

1452
01:13:38,613 --> 01:13:40,046
You need
anything else?

1453
01:13:40,114 --> 01:13:42,883
Oh, we're fine,
thank you.

1454
01:13:42,950 --> 01:13:44,284
Well...

1455
01:13:46,621 --> 01:13:48,856
Bye, Annie.

1456
01:13:48,923 --> 01:13:51,859
So, let's not let
another 30 years
go by, ok?

1457
01:13:51,926 --> 01:13:54,795
Ok. I'll talk
to you soon.

1458
01:13:59,133 --> 01:14:01,502
Wait, Annie.

1459
01:14:05,072 --> 01:14:06,940
I just--
I wish so much

1460
01:14:07,008 --> 01:14:10,110
That I could've talked
to Eliot one last time.

1461
01:14:10,177 --> 01:14:12,245
I'm so sorry I didn't.

1462
01:14:12,347 --> 01:14:15,048
But mostly,
I'm sorry that...

1463
01:14:15,116 --> 01:14:17,117
I wasn't there for you.

1464
01:14:17,184 --> 01:14:20,354
So, even if we
haven't spoken,

1465
01:14:20,421 --> 01:14:23,257
You were always
there with me.

1466
01:14:23,324 --> 01:14:24,758
Thank you.

1467
01:14:24,825 --> 01:14:26,360
Hey.

1468
01:14:26,427 --> 01:14:28,395
Happy 50th anniversary.

1469
01:14:28,463 --> 01:14:30,163
Thank you.

1470
01:14:33,635 --> 01:14:35,101
Have a nice trip.

1471
01:14:35,203 --> 01:14:37,237
Come back, ok?
Thank you.

1472
01:14:38,372 --> 01:14:39,873
I'm proud of you, Doug.

1473
01:14:39,941 --> 01:14:41,775
Eliot would be, too.

1474
01:14:53,722 --> 01:14:55,455
[Door closes]

1475
01:14:58,492 --> 01:15:00,260
[engine starts]

1476
01:15:22,583 --> 01:15:24,651
[sighs]

1477
01:15:26,587 --> 01:15:28,989
Grandma, I think
we need to get you out
of this car for a while.

1478
01:15:29,057 --> 01:15:30,190
No.

1479
01:15:30,258 --> 01:15:32,492
But you look really
uncomfortable.

1480
01:15:32,560 --> 01:15:34,494
Ella bear,
in less than two hours,

1481
01:15:34,562 --> 01:15:37,531
I'll have more energy
than I'll know what
to do with.

1482
01:15:37,598 --> 01:15:39,166
Trust me.

1483
01:16:05,760 --> 01:16:07,427
Hey.

1484
01:16:16,771 --> 01:16:19,373
Annie: It's more beautiful
than I remember.

1485
01:16:24,945 --> 01:16:28,248
It hasn't changed
one bit.

1486
01:16:31,653 --> 01:16:34,488
It's as though we were
here yesterday.

1487
01:16:36,057 --> 01:16:39,426
Oh, your grandfather
looked so handsome.

1488
01:17:39,153 --> 01:17:41,989
I'm ready to take
grandpa home now.

1489
01:17:45,593 --> 01:17:47,127
Richard: Brenda?
<i>Yes?</i>

1490
01:17:47,195 --> 01:17:48,628
You got the three
wise men on the phone?

1491
01:17:48,696 --> 01:17:49,930
<i>Uh-huh.</i>
Great.

1492
01:17:49,998 --> 01:17:51,131
Put 'em through.

1493
01:17:51,199 --> 01:17:52,632
<i>Ok.</i>

1494
01:17:55,069 --> 01:17:56,469
Gentlemen.
<i>Hello, Richard.</i>

1495
01:17:56,537 --> 01:17:57,805
Are we all together?

1496
01:17:57,872 --> 01:17:59,173
<i>Yes, we're all here.</i>
Good.

1497
01:17:59,240 --> 01:18:00,640
<i>Listen, we'd like to</i>
<i>talk to you about--</i>

1498
01:18:00,708 --> 01:18:02,109
Let me start out
by saying that,

1499
01:18:02,177 --> 01:18:03,944
While I can certainly
appreciate your desire

1500
01:18:04,012 --> 01:18:05,979
To see these projects
through to completion,

1501
01:18:06,047 --> 01:18:08,282
What I do not appreciate
is being talked to

1502
01:18:08,349 --> 01:18:09,950
And treated
like an amateur.

1503
01:18:10,018 --> 01:18:12,352
My father put all
three of you on the map,
and your companies,

1504
01:18:12,420 --> 01:18:14,654
Without ever
letting you down,
and I won't, either.

1505
01:18:14,722 --> 01:18:16,824
But right now
my family needs me,

1506
01:18:16,891 --> 01:18:18,658
And I refuse to
let <i>them</i> down.

1507
01:18:18,726 --> 01:18:20,828
So, I will contact you
when I get back to town,

1508
01:18:20,895 --> 01:18:22,062
And when that happens,

1509
01:18:22,130 --> 01:18:23,897
I will fulfill
all of my obligations,

1510
01:18:23,964 --> 01:18:26,266
As I expect you
to fulfill all of yours.

1511
01:18:26,334 --> 01:18:28,235
We understand each other?
<i>Yes, we do.</i>

1512
01:18:28,303 --> 01:18:31,571
Excellent.
Have a nice day.

1513
01:18:54,763 --> 01:18:57,296
Are you sure
this is it?

1514
01:18:57,364 --> 01:18:59,633
I'm sure. Heh!

1515
01:19:20,388 --> 01:19:22,055
Is it how
you remembered?

1516
01:19:22,123 --> 01:19:24,658
It's beautiful.

1517
01:19:35,269 --> 01:19:38,204
Well, now I can see what
the fuss was all about.

1518
01:19:40,107 --> 01:19:42,942
Hey.
Oh!

1519
01:19:45,313 --> 01:19:47,180
Hi, daddy.
Hi, honey.

1520
01:19:48,816 --> 01:19:50,750
Annie:
Thank you, Richard.

1521
01:19:50,818 --> 01:19:52,819
I'm sorry you thought
you had to chase me

1522
01:19:52,886 --> 01:19:54,521
Clear across country.

1523
01:19:54,589 --> 01:19:58,091
But coming here was
very important to me.

1524
01:19:58,158 --> 01:19:59,926
When I started
this Journey,

1525
01:19:59,993 --> 01:20:03,129
I honestly believed
I'd soon be joining
your father.

1526
01:20:03,197 --> 01:20:05,765
I guess what I'm
trying to say is...

1527
01:20:05,833 --> 01:20:07,934
I'm sorry I made life
so difficult.

1528
01:20:07,969 --> 01:20:08,935
You were just
looking for support.

1529
01:20:09,003 --> 01:20:10,470
No, I was being selfish.

1530
01:20:10,537 --> 01:20:13,606
You were the one doing
your best to help.

1531
01:20:16,010 --> 01:20:17,710
But now that I'm here,

1532
01:20:17,779 --> 01:20:21,248
I feel reborn.

1533
01:20:21,315 --> 01:20:23,183
And I owe a lot
of that to Ella.

1534
01:20:23,284 --> 01:20:24,484
Ohh.

1535
01:20:24,552 --> 01:20:26,886
She's just like
her mother.

1536
01:20:26,954 --> 01:20:30,389
Well, and she's also
just like her father.

1537
01:20:30,458 --> 01:20:32,392
You're a good dad,
Richard.

1538
01:20:34,962 --> 01:20:37,130
Your father would be
proud of you.

1539
01:21:02,289 --> 01:21:03,790
Wow.

1540
01:21:05,627 --> 01:21:08,862
Yeah. Dad told me
about this.

1541
01:21:08,929 --> 01:21:10,464
He wanted you
to have it.

1542
01:21:11,732 --> 01:21:13,700
Thanks.

1543
01:21:18,906 --> 01:21:21,174
I'll only be a minute.

1544
01:21:35,990 --> 01:21:38,624
[Sighs]

1545
01:21:38,693 --> 01:21:42,062
Oh, Eliot, we made it!

1546
01:21:42,130 --> 01:21:44,231
And on time!

1547
01:21:45,933 --> 01:21:48,334
Wasn't able to finish
the picture, Eliot.

1548
01:21:48,402 --> 01:21:52,438
I was afraid
I forgot what
the place looks like.

1549
01:21:52,507 --> 01:21:54,374
But it's the same,
isn't it?

1550
01:22:00,682 --> 01:22:02,015
[Laughs] ohh!

1551
01:22:02,083 --> 01:22:05,018
Oh, I miss you,
my dear.

1552
01:22:05,086 --> 01:22:07,654
You could always
make me laugh.

1553
01:22:11,292 --> 01:22:14,061
I heard you sing.

1554
01:22:14,128 --> 01:22:16,329
I know.

1555
01:22:16,397 --> 01:22:18,831
You were really,
really good.

1556
01:22:18,899 --> 01:22:21,568
I wish your mom
could've heard you.

1557
01:22:21,635 --> 01:22:23,370
I think she did.

1558
01:22:25,239 --> 01:22:28,007
I miss her so much.

1559
01:22:28,076 --> 01:22:29,842
I've never been able
to let her go.

1560
01:22:29,910 --> 01:22:33,113
But that's no excuse
for me to be as hard
on you as I've been.

1561
01:22:33,181 --> 01:22:35,848
You're just
being a dad.
Yeah.

1562
01:22:35,917 --> 01:22:38,618
And, as your dad,

1563
01:22:38,685 --> 01:22:41,320
I need to
tell you that...

1564
01:22:41,388 --> 01:22:43,389
You don't have to go
back to school.

1565
01:22:46,127 --> 01:22:48,728
I just need something
else right now.

1566
01:22:50,765 --> 01:22:54,000
But I promise I won't
leave you in the dark
anymore.

1567
01:22:54,068 --> 01:22:56,269
I'll let you know
what I'm feeling...

1568
01:22:56,336 --> 01:22:58,304
Whether you like it
or not.

1569
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,273
[Laughs] ok.

1570
01:23:02,009 --> 01:23:03,676
Let's go see how
your grandma's doing.

1571
01:23:10,785 --> 01:23:13,519
Mom? You ok?

1572
01:23:17,258 --> 01:23:19,125
Mom?

1573
01:23:19,193 --> 01:23:20,994
Grandma!
Mom!

1574
01:23:21,062 --> 01:23:22,728
Are you ok?

1575
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:27,066
Can't an old woman
take a nap without a fuss?

01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:29,135
Ohh, for a minute
there, I, uh...

1577
01:23:29,203 --> 01:23:30,403
Thought maybe...

1578
01:23:30,471 --> 01:23:32,439
You thought what?
Well--

1579
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:34,841
That I came
all this way to die?

1580
01:23:34,908 --> 01:23:36,409
Are you kidding me?

1581
01:23:36,477 --> 01:23:38,311
Did you take
your medication?

1582
01:23:38,379 --> 01:23:41,714
What do I tell you
every time you ask?
Sorry.

1583
01:23:41,782 --> 01:23:44,317
You can be
a bit of a pest.

1584
01:23:44,352 --> 01:23:46,953
But I know
you mean well.

1585
01:23:57,665 --> 01:23:59,198
Shall we?

1586
01:24:22,356 --> 01:24:24,557
Happy anniversary, my love.

1587
01:24:26,527 --> 01:24:28,995
