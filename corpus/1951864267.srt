far past statistical comfort.

98

- I wasn't kidding.

We could have stopped.

103
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:42,398
What? Eating, driving,
living our lives?

104
00:05:42,398 --> 00:05:44,776
We could live on less.
Lots of people live on less.

105
00:05:44,776 --> 00:05:47,570
Absolutely. And soon,
we'll be living with them.

106
00:05:47,570 --> 00:05:49,447
You know, hearing their
voices in the hallways,

107
00:05:49,447 --> 00:05:51,241
smelling
their cooking.

108
00:05:51,241 --> 00:05:53,326
But, hey, at least
we got our health.

109
00:05:53,326 --> 00:05:55,036
Of course, we don't
have health insurance,

110
00:05:55,036 --> 00:05:58,165
so if you need an X-ray,
I sell a kidney.

111
00:05:58,165 --> 00:06:00,542
We'll do something.
We'll think outside the box.

112
00:06:00,542 --> 00:06:03,045
Well, that's good, because
we're selling the box

113
00:06:03,045 --> 00:06:04,922
and we're moving into
a smaller box,

114
00:06:04,963 --> 00:06:06,590
and soon that box
will be so small,

115
00:06:06,632 --> 00:06:08,759
it's the one they put us
in the ground with.

116
00:06:08,801 --> 00:06:11,679
We'll get jobs,
any jobs, both of us,

117
00:06:11,679 --> 00:06:14,473
and we're gonna make our payments
until this economy gets better, Don.

118
00:06:14,473 --> 00:06:16,726

124
00:06:29,906 --> 00:06:33,368

Sort of a slow sector
of the economy right now.

129
00:06:43,879 --> 00:06:46,674
And your typing
is sub-standard.

Look, the truth is people
your age in the workforce

133
00:06:56,684 --> 00:06:59,687

real pains in the ass.

Of course.

158
00:07:54,077 --> 00:07:57,831
Honestly, Selina, I don't really
have the money right now,

180
00:08:46,215 --> 00:08:48,634
Long story.

181
00:08:48,634 --> 00:08:50,344
Tell me about the job.

182
00:08:50,344 --> 00:08:53,764
I didn't even know what the
Federal Reserve Bank does

183
00:08:53,764 --> 00:08:55,224
before I came
to work here.

184
00:08:55,224 --> 00:08:56,684
Well, they set
interest rates

185
00:08:56,684 --> 00:09:01,606
and they hold extra cash from all
the other banks for safekeeping.

186
00:09:01,606 --> 00:09:05,151
Yeah--No, I--I asked
my husband.

187
00:09:05,151 --> 00:09:08,405
Now that could be your
savings account right there.

188
00:09:08,405 --> 00:09:09,948
I don't think so.
It has money in it.

189
00:09:09,948 --> 00:09:11,241
[laughs]

190
00:09:11,241 --> 00:09:13,994
Oh, we're running
a little bit behind today.

191
00:09:13,994 --> 00:09:16,288
And don't think
they won't notice.

192
00:09:16,288 --> 00:09:18,332
Oh, they tell you
it's for security,

193
00:09:18,332 --> 00:09:20,667
but meanwhile,
the guys in the ties

194
00:09:20,709 --> 00:09:24,004
are keeping track of how many
times a day we need a goddamn pee.

195
00:09:24,046 --> 00:09:27,508
Ha! This place is like
a Las Vegas casino.

196
00:09:27,508 --> 00:09:29,385
No windows,
no privacy,

197
00:09:29,385 --> 00:09:31,554
and a shitload of money
all around here.

198
00:09:31,554 --> 00:09:35,182
The only difference is
nobody here ever has any fun.

I do, yes.
Yes, sir, I do.

about wanting...the job!

222
00:11:06,986 --> 00:11:08,863
Worn out.

223

<i>But how often do we really look
at the actual physical cash?</i>

keys in the entire system

a cash cart.

something?

Excuse me?

What, him?

00:20:14,307 --> 00:20:15,600
You find that
appealing?

Ecch.
- No, no.

375

You think what I want
after along day on my feet

376
00:20:19,228 --> 00:20:21,314
is to lie down under
some skinny kid

377
00:20:21,314 --> 00:20:22,732
for three minutes
of push-ups?

378
00:20:22,732 --> 00:20:24,150
No, that's not what
I'm talking about.

00:20:24,150 --> 00:20:26,778
I got around plenty in my party
girl days, but I got kids now.

No, no, I meant...

tempted to just slip

here is all about?

So what are you, some kinda
like super genius or something?

396
00:21:02,357 --> 00:21:04,275
No. That's what's so funny.
It's just staring you in the face.

they've seen it?

No.
- Why?

400
00:21:08,655 --> 00:21:11,199

Okay.
All right.

No. You?
- Not with a lock.

No, it won't.

to be walking around the Fed

Nina, you look really hot today,"

start stealing money,

We need to talk to you

Okay.

544
00:28:36,413 --> 00:28:37,539

could have told them,

00:41:52,659 --> 00:41:55,579
Okay. I have $32,000.

716
00:41:55,579 --> 00:41:58,123
31.
- 28.

717
00:41:58,123 --> 00:42:00,542
[laughs]
- [laughs]

718
00:42:00,542 --> 00:42:02,169
Damn.
- What?

719
00:42:02,169 --> 00:42:03,378
What's the matter?

720
00:42:03,378 --> 00:42:05,422
If we each give her one,
that leaves a thousand,

721
00:42:05,422 --> 00:42:07,466
which is 333 each.

722
00:42:07,466 --> 00:42:09,802
There's gonna be
a dollar left over.

723
00:42:09,802 --> 00:42:11,971
I might have change.

724
00:42:11,971 --> 00:42:13,681
Keep the change.

725
00:42:13,681 --> 00:42:16,559

00:42:25,819 --> 00:42:28,071
[all talking]

730
00:42:28,071 --> 00:42:31,366

making that cash!

Don.

734
00:42:39,583 --> 00:42:40,709
Hi.

735
00:42:42,795 --> 00:42:44,421
Wanna lap dance?

736
00:42:44,421 --> 00:42:48,300

738
00:42:50,719 --> 00:42:52,179
You know something?
I would have thought

739
00:42:52,179 --> 00:42:54,181
you would have been
a whole lot happier.

740
00:42:54,181 --> 00:42:56,767
Oh, forgive me for getting
insufficient kicks

741
00:42:56,767 --> 00:42:59,061
when somebody I'm married to
commits a felony.

742
00:42:59,061 --> 00:43:00,438
Don!

743
00:43:00,438 --> 00:43:02,482
This money doesn't even
officially exist anymore.

744
00:43:02,482 --> 00:43:03,942
That's the beauty
of the whole thing.

745
00:43:03,942 --> 00:43:06,277
Look at it.
It's worn out.

746
00:43:06,277 --> 00:43:07,570
It's gonna be shredded.

747
00:43:07,570 --> 00:43:09,823
So what do we do?
We take some. We spend it.

748
00:43:09,823 --> 00:43:12,117
It goes to another bank.
It's still worn out.

749
00:43:12,117 --> 00:43:13,535
So what do they do?

750
00:43:13,535 --> 00:43:15,704
They pull it
from the system...again!

751
00:43:15,704 --> 00:43:19,082
It's like we're stealing
the same money over and over.

752
00:43:19,082 --> 00:43:21,585
In fact, it's not even
like stealing money at all.

753
00:43:21,585 --> 00:43:23,045
It's more like
recycling.

754
00:43:23,045 --> 00:43:24,922
Oh, recycling!

755
00:43:24,922 --> 00:43:27,007
Yeah, your defense attorney's
gonna love that one, Bridget.

756
00:43:27,007 --> 00:43:28,425
I'm not gonna
get caught.

757
00:43:28,425 --> 00:43:30,636
My God, Don, we're
very careful.

758
00:43:30,636 --> 00:43:31,929
We have signals
and "go" codes.

759
00:43:31,929 --> 00:43:34,432
We have a system here
that works--

760
00:43:34,432 --> 00:43:37,643
Oh, please, God. Tell me you're
not planning on doing this again.

761
00:43:37,643 --> 00:43:40,021
What--what, do you think
I'm stupid?

762
00:43:40,021 --> 00:43:41,814
Of course we're going
to do this again.

763
00:43:41,814 --> 00:43:43,066
At least until we get
out of the hole.

764
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:44,984
Four or five more times.

765
00:43:44,984 --> 00:43:46,528
Nina gets school paper,

766
00:43:46,528 --> 00:43:48,154
and Jackie, honestly,
I really don't know

767
00:43:48,154 --> 00:43:49,614
what the hell
she is going to do.

768
00:43:49,614 --> 00:43:51,533
You know something?
You've gone insane, Bridget.

769
00:43:51,533 --> 00:43:54,870
Honey, you see
a $20 bill on the sidewalk.

770
00:43:54,870 --> 00:43:56,621
Let me just ask you.
What do you do?

771
00:43:56,621 --> 00:43:58,999
Do you walk away? No.

772
00:43:58,999 --> 00:44:00,792
You know, I guess
it would depend

773
00:44:00,792 --> 00:44:02,753
on whether or not
the sidewalk

774
00:44:02,753 --> 00:44:05,297
were locked inside
a Federal bank!

775
00:44:05,297 --> 00:44:08,801
Honestly! When you have spent
months cleaning their toilets,

776
00:44:08,801 --> 00:44:10,302
the whole
Federal bank thing

777
00:44:10,302 --> 00:44:13,055
doesn't seem like
such a great big deal.

778
00:44:13,055 --> 00:44:15,558
What about the overall
system of monetary flow, hmm?

779
00:44:15,558 --> 00:44:16,851
What?

780
00:44:16,851 --> 00:44:19,145
You know that they print
a certain amount of money

781
00:44:19,145 --> 00:44:21,189
relating to assets in
other parts of the system.

782
00:44:21,189 --> 00:44:23,733
Uh-huh. Where?
I don't know, but--

783
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:25,276
Yes!
- Seriously, you could be...

784
00:44:25,318 --> 00:44:28,113
you could be throwing off
the entire balance of trade.

785
00:44:28,154 --> 00:44:31,157
You could be endangering the
dollar against the--the yen.

786
00:44:31,157 --> 00:44:34,077
Don, I am gonna keep
doing this.

787
00:44:34,077 --> 00:44:36,204
The yen is just gonna
have to take care of itself.

788
00:44:36,204 --> 00:44:37,998
[bell rings]

789
00:44:37,998 --> 00:44:39,708
See, the problem is

790
00:44:39,708 --> 00:44:42,377
we just don't accept
mid-semester transfers

791
00:44:42,377 --> 00:44:44,630
or financial aid
students. We--

792
00:44:44,630 --> 00:44:46,715
I won't be needing
financial aid.

793
00:44:46,715 --> 00:44:48,300
I'm sorry?

794
00:44:48,300 --> 00:44:51,220
I can pay now...
for the full year.

795
00:44:51,220 --> 00:44:52,805
Oh.

796
00:44:52,805 --> 00:44:54,015
I might also be inclined

797
00:44:54,015 --> 00:44:56,767
to make a significant donation
to your new library...

798
00:44:56,767 --> 00:44:58,686
if my sons were using it.

799
00:44:59,937 --> 00:45:02,523
Well, that would...

800
00:45:02,523 --> 00:45:03,942
be a different situation
now, wouldn't it?

801
00:45:03,942 --> 00:45:05,693
Can I pay you in crack?

802
00:45:08,738 --> 00:45:09,990
I'm just kidding with you.

803
00:45:09,990 --> 00:45:12,117
Oh.

804
00:45:12,117 --> 00:45:13,577
[clears throat]

805
00:45:13,577 --> 00:45:15,787
It has to be under ten.

806
00:45:15,787 --> 00:45:18,999
Anything over 10,000 is
automatically reported to the IRS.

807
00:45:18,999 --> 00:45:21,126
I know.
You told me.

808
00:45:21,126 --> 00:45:23,253
I'm gonna keep the engine
going while you're in there.

809
00:45:23,253 --> 00:45:25,464
Relax.

810
00:45:25,464 --> 00:45:27,675
We're making a deposit, Don.
We already robbed the bank.

811
00:45:27,675 --> 00:45:29,760
That's not even funny.

812
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:31,262
Honey, you know what?
You gotta lighten up,

813
00:45:31,262 --> 00:45:32,680
or I'm gonna have to
have you whacked.

814
00:45:32,680 --> 00:45:34,015
When did you even start
talking like that?

815
00:45:34,015 --> 00:45:35,224
I'm kidding you.

816
00:45:35,224 --> 00:45:37,143
But really, sweetie,

817
00:45:37,143 --> 00:45:40,813
I'm the only person in the
whole world who thought this up.

818
00:45:40,813 --> 00:45:42,273
Why can't you
be proud of me?

819
00:45:42,273 --> 00:45:44,901
I have no idea
who you are anymore,

820
00:45:44,901 --> 00:45:46,986
but I'm enormously
proud of you.

821
00:45:48,279 --> 00:45:50,490
Really?
- Yeah!

822
00:45:50,490 --> 00:45:52,242
No, you are amazing.

823
00:45:52,242 --> 00:45:53,577
Really? Are you
proud of me?

824
00:45:53,577 --> 00:45:54,995
Tell me again.
- You are so hot.

825
00:45:57,539 --> 00:45:58,665
Oh, my God.

826
00:45:58,665 --> 00:46:01,043
When was the last time
we did it in a car?

827
00:46:01,043 --> 00:46:02,169
We've never done it
in the car.

828
00:46:02,169 --> 00:46:04,505
It'd be so stupid
to do it in a car...

829
00:46:04,546 --> 00:46:06,298
'cause we have a house.

830
00:46:06,298 --> 00:46:07,675
Oh, God,
yes, we do.

831
00:46:07,716 --> 00:46:08,926
We have a house.

832
00:46:08,926 --> 00:46:11,053
Let's go do it
in our house.

833
00:46:11,053 --> 00:46:12,221
You know what?
- What?

834
00:46:12,221 --> 00:46:14,223
They got a park
right behind the bank.

835
00:46:14,223 --> 00:46:15,975
Oh, that is such
a good idea! Yes!

836
00:46:15,975 --> 00:46:18,895
Okay, which ones do you want me
to get the cashier's checks for?

837
00:46:18,895 --> 00:46:20,396
Baby, keep that
engine running.

838
00:46:23,566 --> 00:46:24,776

over.

No, that's--that's
a bad idea.

00:47:49,781 --> 00:47:52,075
Yeah. He's right.
That wasn't part of the deal.

you know, get what
we needed and get out.

872
00:47:54,911 --> 00:47:58,957
I think we need more, right?

873
00:47:58,957 --> 00:48:02,127
I could use more.

Don! You've worked your ass
off for 30 years and for what?

become a janitor?

have a better life,

00:48:29,489 --> 00:48:31,116
wanted to do
with your life.

888
00:48:31,116 --> 00:48:35,871
Yes. I wanna see Brazil
and Czechoslovakia

889
00:48:35,871 --> 00:48:37,789
and India--

890
00:48:37,789 --> 00:48:40,167
Actually, there is no
Czechoslovakia.

891
00:48:40,167 --> 00:48:42,961
What?

892
00:48:42,961 --> 00:48:45,881
It's--it's either the Czech
Republic now or Slovakia.

893
00:48:45,881 --> 00:48:48,133
Since when?

894
00:48:48,133 --> 00:48:50,010
1992.

895
00:48:50,010 --> 00:48:52,388
India's still there,
right?

896
00:48:52,388 --> 00:48:55,016
Yes. Yes.
Absolutely.

897
00:48:55,016 --> 00:48:57,185
I wanna see those places for myself.
- Yeah.

898
00:48:57,185 --> 00:48:59,395
And I don't care
where we go

899
00:48:59,395 --> 00:49:01,606
just as long as I don't have
to carry any more dead cows.

900
00:49:03,358 --> 00:49:04,817
What's that?

901
00:49:04,817 --> 00:49:07,487
Bob works for Allen
Brothers Meat Packing.

902
00:49:07,487 --> 00:49:09,948
Oh. Oh.
- There you go.

903
00:49:09,948 --> 00:49:11,741
Don.
- What?

904
00:49:11,741 --> 00:49:15,829
Is it wrong? Is it really, really,
really terrible to want security?

905
00:49:15,829 --> 00:49:19,041
Long-term financial
security?

906
00:49:19,041 --> 00:49:21,585
How about long-term
maximum security?

907
00:49:21,627 --> 00:49:23,212
Because that's where we're
headed if we keep doing this.

908
00:49:23,212 --> 00:49:24,922
Never having
to worry again

909
00:49:24,963 --> 00:49:28,759
about sickness, old age, the real
estate market, corporate fallout,

910
00:49:28,759 --> 00:49:29,760
your kids in college,

911
00:49:29,802 --> 00:49:32,304
and a master bath
with a walk-in closet.

912
00:49:32,304 --> 00:49:33,639
What?

913
00:49:33,639 --> 00:49:35,308
You almost sounded rational
there for a minute.

914
00:49:35,308 --> 00:49:36,517
A walk-in closet?

915
00:49:36,517 --> 00:49:39,228
We can't spend that money.

916
00:49:39,228 --> 00:49:40,938
I'm sorry.
What?

917
00:49:40,938 --> 00:49:42,315
You know how people
get busted?

918
00:49:42,315 --> 00:49:44,984
They brag
and they flash.

919
00:49:44,984 --> 00:49:47,320
You don't think it will
draw a little attention?

920
00:49:47,320 --> 00:49:49,864
Three girls from the Fed start
spending money they can't explain?

921
00:49:49,864 --> 00:49:51,700
I mean, if we're
gonna do this,

922
00:49:51,700 --> 00:49:53,451
no big-ticket
purchases,

923
00:49:53,451 --> 00:49:54,619
no lifestyle changes.

924
00:49:54,619 --> 00:49:57,205
We just go slow
and be smart.

925
00:49:57,205 --> 00:49:58,707
Oh, man.

926
00:49:58,707 --> 00:50:00,375
I hate being smart.

927
00:50:00,375 --> 00:50:02,795
When it's enough,

928
00:50:02,795 --> 00:50:04,713
we all move somewhere
where nobody knows

929
00:50:04,713 --> 00:50:06,840
we're not supposed to have
that kind of money.

930
00:50:06,840 --> 00:50:11,429
Look, Nina, I understand that
you don't want to spend the money,

931
00:50:11,429 --> 00:50:13,180
and you don't
really want sex--

932
00:50:13,180 --> 00:50:15,057
Wait a minute!

933
00:50:15,057 --> 00:50:16,726

I want to have sex.

come back in a minute.

It's been seven years.

936
00:50:19,979 --> 00:50:22,106
I want it all day
and all night.

937
00:50:22,106 --> 00:50:23,691
But while we're living
in the real world,

938
00:50:23,691 --> 00:50:26,569
if we're gonna do this, we're
gonna do it right or not at all.

to understand.

This is my plan.

941
00:50:30,448 --> 00:50:33,243
Okay. So go do your plan!

942
00:50:33,243 --> 00:50:36,079
Oops. You can't, can you?

943
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:37,914
Not by yourself.
You can't tell me what to do.

944

945

no way at all.

- No.

No, I never put it

00:57:01,522 --> 00:57:03,441
I ought to report you.

1065
00:57:03,441 --> 00:57:04,609
What the hell did you
say to her, man?

1066
00:57:04,609 --> 00:57:06,569
Nothing.

1067
00:57:06,569 --> 00:57:08,154
Maybe she reads minds.
[elevator dings]

1068
00:57:24,963 --> 00:57:26,423
You need a hand with that?

1069
00:57:26,423 --> 00:57:28,467
No. No, no, no,
It's just fine.

1070
00:57:28,467 --> 00:57:30,136
Sometimes with these new
ones, you gotta wiggle them.

1071
00:57:30,136 --> 00:57:31,971
No, no, no.
Let me help you. I got it.

1072
00:57:31,971 --> 00:57:33,264
Your carpal tunnel
and everything.

1073
00:57:33,264 --> 00:57:34,432
Oh!

1074
00:57:39,187 --> 00:57:41,064
Oh!

1075
00:57:41,064 --> 00:57:42,774
Hey!

1076
00:57:42,815 --> 00:57:45,401
Seriously, guys!
Grow up, okay!

1077
00:57:45,401 --> 00:57:46,986
I'm not your personal
maid, all right?

1078
00:57:49,072 --> 00:57:50,448
Oh, yes!

1079
00:57:56,830 --> 00:57:58,290
Hi.

1080
00:57:58,290 --> 00:57:59,374
Slow it down.

1081
00:58:08,801 --> 00:58:10,719
Man!

1082
00:58:10,719 --> 00:58:12,471
This thing's
really stuck.

1083
00:58:12,471 --> 00:58:13,222
Security.

1084
00:58:14,724 --> 00:58:17,226
I'll be right back.
One second.

1086
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:27,862
Oh! Whose your pick
for the playoffs?

1087
00:58:27,862 --> 00:58:29,572
What playoffs?

1088
00:58:29,572 --> 00:58:32,075
Oh!
[laughs]

1089
00:58:32,075 --> 00:58:34,911
Oh, my God.
I thought there were playoffs.

1090
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:36,079
Oh, man.

1091
00:58:36,079 --> 00:58:37,414
Oh, my God.

1092
00:58:40,584 --> 00:58:42,002
Got it.

1093
00:58:42,002 --> 00:58:43,128
Great.

1094
00:58:47,675 --> 00:58:49,426
Told you.

Yeah?

1100
00:59:08,321 --> 00:59:09,614
Oh, thank God.

1101
00:59:09,614 --> 00:59:11,533
They're okay.

1102
00:59:11,533 --> 00:59:13,827
Oh, sweetheart.

1103
00:59:13,827 --> 00:59:16,496
Oh, yeah!

Oh, God!

1105
00:59:19,791 --> 00:59:20,876
Wow.

1106
00:59:29,134 --> 00:59:30,261
I'm sorry about your job.

1107
00:59:32,430 --> 00:59:34,181
I hated my job.

1108
00:59:36,684 --> 00:59:39,020
I used to think
I did, too.

1109
00:59:44,442 --> 00:59:46,528
We need to talk.

1110
00:59:48,530 --> 00:59:51,825
Look, Barry, I know you're
probably a really nice guy and all,

1111
00:59:51,825 --> 00:59:53,618
and I don't want to
make you feel badly,

1112
00:59:53,618 --> 00:59:56,121
but I'm really not in a
place in my life right now--

1113
00:59:58,457 --> 01:00:01,960
Unless you have half a dozen
very hard, rectangular breasts,

1114
01:00:01,960 --> 01:00:04,505
we need to talk.

1115
01:00:07,132 --> 01:00:09,718
Are you ought of your mind?

1116
01:00:09,718 --> 01:00:10,970
Look, if you're
gonna bust me, bust me.

1117
01:00:10,970 --> 01:00:13,305
I don't need a lecture.

1118
01:00:13,305 --> 01:00:14,890
Who else is it?

1119
01:00:14,890 --> 01:00:16,601
The trash woman.
Who else?

1120
01:00:16,601 --> 01:00:18,519
I can't tell you that.

1121
01:00:18,519 --> 01:00:21,022
Tell them it's over.

1122
01:00:25,944 --> 01:00:27,153
What does he mean it's over?

1123
01:00:27,153 --> 01:00:29,280
Does it mean he turns
us in and we go to prison?

1124
01:00:29,280 --> 01:00:30,740
It's over, and nobody
says anything?

1125
01:00:30,740 --> 01:00:32,033
We walk away it's over?

1126
01:00:32,033 --> 01:00:33,785
I don't know. I'm just
telling you what he said.

1127
01:00:33,785 --> 01:00:34,911
That's kinda like
a major difference.

Okay, okay.
Please stop fighting.

1130
01:00:40,250 --> 01:00:41,460
Now now, not here.

1131
01:00:41,460 --> 01:00:43,837
I think it meant
walk away.

1132
01:00:43,837 --> 01:00:45,047
Yeah, because?

1133
01:00:45,047 --> 01:00:46,966
Because we're
still here.

1134
01:00:48,842 --> 01:00:50,386
Wow.

1135
01:00:50,386 --> 01:00:52,388
And he...
he likes me.

1136
01:00:52,388 --> 01:00:53,472
Hmm?

1137
01:00:55,641 --> 01:00:57,685
He does like you,
doesn't he?

1138
01:00:58,895 --> 01:01:00,897
A lot.

1139
01:01:02,023 --> 01:01:04,943
Oh, no.
No. Uh-uh!

1140
01:01:04,984 --> 01:01:06,820
That would be brilliant, Nina.
- No!

1141
01:01:06,820 --> 01:01:08,571
If you guys got
together,

1142
01:01:08,571 --> 01:01:11,116
and then he was
on our team, and then...

1143
01:01:11,116 --> 01:01:12,617
we would be foolproof.

1144
01:01:12,659 --> 01:01:13,994
So what are you saying?

1145
01:01:13,994 --> 01:01:16,163
Do you know what it is when
somebody trades sex for money?

1146
01:01:16,163 --> 01:01:17,164
Advertising.

1147
01:01:17,164 --> 01:01:19,249
Public service?

1148
01:01:19,249 --> 01:01:21,460
A good percentage
of marriages.

1149
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,629
What is with you people?

1150
01:01:23,629 --> 01:01:25,923
Now these are on me.

1151
01:01:34,015 --> 01:01:36,017
Look, we got a good thing
going here.

1152
01:01:36,017 --> 01:01:37,977
And if getting Barry
on our side

1153
01:01:37,977 --> 01:01:39,812
is the only way
we can keep going,

1154
01:01:39,812 --> 01:01:41,314
I don't think it's asking too much
for you to take one for the team.

1155
01:01:41,314 --> 01:01:43,775
Right.
I mean...

1156
01:01:43,775 --> 01:01:46,194
besides, he's
a total babe.

1157
01:01:46,194 --> 01:01:47,779
And you know, honey,
we would do this for you.

1158
01:01:47,779 --> 01:01:49,072
We would do this for you.
- Right.

1159
01:01:49,072 --> 01:01:50,824
Except we happen
to be married.

1160
01:01:50,824 --> 01:01:51,950
And of course,
guess what?

1161
01:01:51,950 --> 01:01:53,702
P.S., he doesn't
even want us.

1162
01:01:53,702 --> 01:01:55,036
He might not even
want me.

1163
01:01:55,036 --> 01:01:58,123
Oh, yeah, right.
Okay.

1164
01:01:58,123 --> 01:01:59,666
Wake up!

1165
01:01:59,666 --> 01:02:02,252
He's, like, all over
you all the time.

1166
01:02:02,252 --> 01:02:04,755
Nina,

1167
01:02:04,755 --> 01:02:08,050
are you worried because
it's been so long?

1168
01:02:08,050 --> 01:02:13,597
No, Nina, it's just like
riding a bicycle...upside down.

1169
01:02:13,597 --> 01:02:17,059
Okay, look, I still know
how to do it, okay?

1170
01:02:17,059 --> 01:02:18,603
I'm good, I promise you.

1171
01:02:18,603 --> 01:02:20,897
I'm good in that
department, all right?

1172
01:02:20,897 --> 01:02:23,816
I'm just-- No.

1173
01:02:23,816 --> 01:02:25,276
I'm worried about how
I'll feel in the morning.

1174
01:02:25,276 --> 01:02:27,612
Sore.

1175
01:02:27,612 --> 01:02:28,947
Rich.

1176
01:02:28,947 --> 01:02:32,075
Why don't we just
cut him in?

1177
01:02:32,075 --> 01:02:33,201
All right.
Whatever works.

1178
01:02:33,201 --> 01:02:34,953
Absolutely.

1179
01:02:37,247 --> 01:02:40,250
But seven years is a
really long time, Nina.

1180
01:02:40,250 --> 01:02:46,006
Let's just leave it that I decide
what I think is right, okay?

1181
01:02:46,006 --> 01:02:47,549
Just get his
address for me.

1182
01:02:52,096 --> 01:02:54,515
Okay.

1183
01:02:54,515 --> 01:02:56,392
All right.
Just breathe.

1184
01:02:56,392 --> 01:02:58,978
Just like riding
a bike, Nina.

1185
01:02:58,978 --> 01:03:00,480
Just like riding a bike.

1186
01:03:01,689 --> 01:03:02,941
[knocks on door]

1187
01:03:02,941 --> 01:03:04,359
Okay.

1188
01:03:04,359 --> 01:03:06,528
You like riding a bike.

1189
01:03:06,528 --> 01:03:08,154
You ain't rode a bike
in a while,

1190
01:03:08,154 --> 01:03:08,863
but it's gonna be okay.

1191
01:03:11,533 --> 01:03:12,450
Hi.
Hi.

1192
01:03:12,450 --> 01:03:13,326
Hi there.

1193
01:03:16,621 --> 01:03:17,581
Wow.

1194
01:03:17,581 --> 01:03:20,167
Um...

1195
01:03:20,167 --> 01:03:22,628
you mind if I come in?

1196
01:03:22,628 --> 01:03:24,380
It's--it's kinda late.

1197
01:03:24,380 --> 01:03:26,256
Um, maybe we could--

1198
01:03:26,256 --> 01:03:28,425
[Woman]
Barry, who is it?

1199
01:03:35,433 --> 01:03:37,935
I'm sorry. I didn't
know about your mom.

1200
01:03:37,935 --> 01:03:40,104
She needs someone
to take care of her.

1201
01:03:40,104 --> 01:03:43,483
Um, maybe we could...

1202
01:03:43,483 --> 01:03:45,443
go out somewhere
sometime.

1203
01:03:45,443 --> 01:03:47,612
Why?

1204
01:03:47,612 --> 01:03:48,780
Why?

1205
01:03:50,448 --> 01:03:52,325
Cards on the table, huh?

1206
01:03:52,325 --> 01:03:53,743
Don't you think?

1207
01:03:55,537 --> 01:03:56,872
[sighs]

1208
01:03:56,872 --> 01:03:59,124
What happened to us

1209
01:03:59,124 --> 01:04:02,836
is we found a way to
get what we wanted.

1210
01:04:02,836 --> 01:04:05,506
I mean, have you ever
thought about it?

1211
01:04:05,506 --> 01:04:07,216
What if you could have
what you wanted?

1212
01:04:07,216 --> 01:04:10,427
I think about it
all the time.

1213
01:04:13,305 --> 01:04:15,600
So what do you want?

1214
01:04:24,234 --> 01:04:25,777
Wow.

1215
01:04:28,238 --> 01:04:29,739
I'm so sorry.

1216
01:04:34,911 --> 01:04:37,414
What the hell is
the matter with you?

1217
01:04:37,414 --> 01:04:38,498
I--I beg your pardon?

1218
01:04:38,498 --> 01:04:42,211
Are you demented?
That is a fantastic woman.

1219
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,212
I know.

1220
01:04:43,212 --> 01:04:46,048
Well? Are you afraid of her?
- No.

1221
01:04:46,048 --> 01:04:48,676
I'm a little afraid
of you at the moment.

1222
01:04:48,676 --> 01:04:50,594
I don't think you're gay.

1223
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:52,054
Thank you.

1224
01:04:52,054 --> 01:04:54,056
Yeah, so you get the girl,
you get the money.

1225
01:04:54,056 --> 01:04:55,558
So what's the problem, huh?

1226
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:01,397
Okay. He'll join up.
He wants a full share.

1227
01:05:01,397 --> 01:05:03,691
He just doesn't want sex
with you to be part of the deal.

1228
01:05:05,318 --> 01:05:07,153
You're kidding.

1229
01:05:07,153 --> 01:05:08,947
No.

1230
01:05:08,947 --> 01:05:10,699
It's possible I'm gonna
have a stroke,

1231
01:05:10,699 --> 01:05:13,952
and they're gonna find
the words "I told you so"

1232
01:05:13,952 --> 01:05:16,580
blocking the blood
to my brain.

1233
01:05:16,580 --> 01:05:18,498
He says you're worth
more than that.

1234
01:05:20,792 --> 01:05:22,169
He said that?

1235
01:05:22,169 --> 01:05:24,046
Yes.

1236
01:05:25,589 --> 01:05:27,174
Oh, he sounds like
a great guy.

1237
01:05:29,176 --> 01:05:30,678
Yeah.

1238
01:05:30,678 --> 01:05:33,013
You should just tell him
that you really want to.

1239
01:05:33,013 --> 01:05:34,390
Now?

1240
01:05:34,390 --> 01:05:36,058
Yeah.

1241
01:05:36,058 --> 01:05:38,519
He probably thinks I'm--

1242
01:05:38,519 --> 01:05:41,481
I told Prince Charming
I'm a whore.

1243
01:05:41,481 --> 01:05:43,149
He didn't say that.

1244
01:05:43,149 --> 01:05:44,817
I told him I'm a whore.

1245
01:05:44,817 --> 01:05:46,444
No, no, no. Come on.
Nina, he didn't say that.

1246
01:05:46,444 --> 01:05:48,238
Don't get neurotic. I mean, really.
- Yeah.

1247
01:05:48,238 --> 01:05:50,240
Okay, forget about it.
Okay, forget it.

1248
01:05:50,240 --> 01:05:53,326
All right?
We're back in business.

1249
01:06:00,500 --> 01:06:02,002
There's a random
search on Thursday.

1250
01:06:02,002 --> 01:06:05,422
So Friday, yeah?

1251
01:06:05,464 --> 01:06:06,632
Works for me.

1252
01:06:06,632 --> 01:06:07,716
Okay, is that it, Friday?

1253
01:06:07,716 --> 01:06:08,968
Friday's good, right?
- Yes.

1254
01:06:14,015 --> 01:06:15,808
This one's yours, right?

1255
01:06:15,808 --> 01:06:17,476
Yeah, thank you.

1256
01:06:19,312 --> 01:06:21,856
Look, I really
owe you an apology.

1257
01:06:21,856 --> 01:06:24,317
You did what you
thought you had to.

1258
01:06:24,317 --> 01:06:25,568
No.

1259
01:06:25,568 --> 01:06:29,197
I'm not...like that.

1260
01:06:29,197 --> 01:06:31,574
And I know you
probably think that--

1261
01:06:31,574 --> 01:06:33,034
Maybe you got
the wrong message here.

1262
01:06:33,034 --> 01:06:36,747
I never said
I didn't want you.

1263
01:06:36,747 --> 01:06:39,207
I just didn't want you
like that.

1264
01:06:40,542 --> 01:06:43,504
Well, look,
maybe we could just...

1265
01:06:43,504 --> 01:06:45,130
start from scratch.

1266
01:07:04,734 --> 01:07:05,735
[sighs]

1267
01:07:09,823 --> 01:07:11,616
Aah!
Oh, my God!

1268
01:07:11,616 --> 01:07:12,951
Oh!

1269
01:07:12,951 --> 01:07:14,286
Sorry.
- Excuse us.

1270
01:07:14,286 --> 01:07:16,997
No, no, that's fine.
I'm actually very sorry.

1271
01:07:16,997 --> 01:07:18,624
[Nina] We'll be out in a minute.

1272
01:07:18,624 --> 01:07:21,043
No, no, please,
take your time.

1273
01:07:21,043 --> 01:07:23,170
Are you kidding me?
Everything's great.

1274
01:07:23,170 --> 01:07:26,674
Yeah, we got federal crimes,
a house full of loot,

1275
01:07:26,674 --> 01:07:28,676
and now people having sex
in our closet.

1276
01:07:28,676 --> 01:07:30,469
I know.

1277
01:07:30,469 --> 01:07:33,347
Oh, come on, Bridget.

1278
01:07:33,347 --> 01:07:35,600
Are you really fine
with all this?

1279
01:07:35,600 --> 01:07:38,936
Well, actually, I'm sort of hoping
she'll finally lighten up a bit

1280
01:07:38,936 --> 01:07:41,647
and let us start spending
some of this money.

1281
01:07:41,689 --> 01:07:43,107
[pushes suitcase

1282
01:07:43,107 --> 01:07:44,192
What?

1283
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:46,486
I don't know.
Maybe I just wanted a job.

1284
01:07:49,739 --> 01:07:51,199
What?

1285
01:07:51,199 --> 01:07:55,078
Actually, I thought
I was losing her.

1286
01:07:55,078 --> 01:07:56,997
And all I could
think of doing

1287
01:07:56,997 --> 01:08:00,626
was try to make her
need me again.

1288
01:08:00,626 --> 01:08:04,379
All right, everyone,
listen up.

1289
01:08:04,379 --> 01:08:06,340
What you need
is a boyfriend.

1290
01:08:06,340 --> 01:08:07,424
Hold up.
- Excuse me?

1291
01:08:07,424 --> 01:08:09,802
What you need
is to not--

1292
01:08:09,802 --> 01:08:10,970
A rich one.

1293
01:08:10,970 --> 01:08:12,263
Someone who's
out of town a lot,

1294
01:08:12,263 --> 01:08:14,223
gets you gifts,

1295
01:08:14,223 --> 01:08:17,602
pays for your kids' tuition
at a fancy private school.

1296
01:08:17,602 --> 01:08:20,730
And what you need
is a job.

1297
01:08:20,730 --> 01:08:23,441
Hey, man,
I'm looking, all right?

1298
01:08:23,441 --> 01:08:25,360
Day trading, all right?
On-line.

1299
01:08:25,360 --> 01:08:27,946
If anybody asks, you're
into short-term futures.

1300
01:08:27,946 --> 01:08:29,614
If somebody
wants a tip

1301
01:08:29,614 --> 01:08:32,742
just tell them the market's
way too volatile.

1302
01:08:32,742 --> 01:08:34,452
Can you write that down?

1303
01:08:34,452 --> 01:08:35,412
Yes.

1304
01:08:35,412 --> 01:08:37,039
Barry,

1305
01:08:37,039 --> 01:08:39,207
your mom's gonna get
a big insurance settlement.

1306
01:08:39,207 --> 01:08:41,126
Huge.

1307
01:08:41,126 --> 01:08:42,878
Of course I will be doing

1308
01:08:42,878 --> 01:08:45,339

consulting out of our house,

1309
01:08:45,339 --> 01:08:46,590

to remodel.

1310
01:08:46,590 --> 01:08:48,676
Okay.
There you are.

1311
01:08:48,676 --> 01:08:50,636
We all have jobs
we need to do

1312
01:08:50,636 --> 01:08:51,637

thereof.

1313
01:08:51,637 --> 01:08:52,930
Isn't he just great?

1314
01:08:54,557 --> 01:08:57,018
Hot damn. We're finally
organized crime.

You're so funny!

Hi, Bridget.
- Hi. Hello.

1352
01:10:58,644 --> 01:11:01,439
Hi. How are you?
Good to see you.

1353
01:11:01,439 --> 01:11:04,108
Oh, hi!

Oh, how are you?

Hey.

- Yeah.

You're not gonna believe this.
- What?

You think?
- Yeah.

1364

Is it weird wanting to sit in an
office all day when you don't have to?

You're a manager.
You need something to manage.

It's a pay cut.

Yeah, I know.

Seriously.

are not allowed
in red-level areas.

maximum security prisons.

showing up.

1394
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:58,060
The thing about
a perfect machine, though,

1395
01:12:58,060 --> 01:13:01,981
is you drop in
one loose screw...

Bam!

Shh!
- Quiet!

Just be quiet.

Okay.

"We're busted"?

Okay, Jackie, but let's
try not to panic, okay?

Yeah, yeah. You said you
never saw him before, right?

You don't know why
he could be here.

01:13:45,735 --> 01:13:47,445
It could be nothing.

1414
01:13:47,445 --> 01:13:49,364
It is not nothing.

1415
01:13:49,364 --> 01:13:53,994
All right, we're just going
to try and find out, all right?

1416
01:13:53,994 --> 01:13:55,203
Okay?

1417
01:13:56,663 --> 01:13:58,206
All right.

1418
01:14:02,252 --> 01:14:03,545
Okay.

1419
01:14:06,423 --> 01:14:11,262
Ah! Service employees who
need access to red-level areas

1420
01:14:11,262 --> 01:14:13,431
are given yellow
I.D. badges.

1421
01:14:13,431 --> 01:14:16,893
A yellow badge is only
allowed in secure areas

1422
01:14:16,893 --> 01:14:19,437
under red-level
supervision.

1423
01:14:19,437 --> 01:14:22,273
Yellow badge employees are
given a rigorous screening

1424
01:14:22,273 --> 01:14:24,108
in national
databanks

1425
01:14:24,150 --> 01:14:27,237
for criminal
and psychiatric history.

1426
01:14:27,237 --> 01:14:29,906
It turns out
they're all crazy.

1427
01:14:29,906 --> 01:14:32,534
[laughs]

1428
01:14:32,534 --> 01:14:33,535
That's a joke.

1429
01:14:36,997 --> 01:14:37,789
Whoa, whoa.

1430
01:14:39,333 --> 01:14:40,417
Aah!

1431
01:14:40,417 --> 01:14:41,501
Whoopsie!

1432
01:14:44,922 --> 01:14:49,885
Oh, I think we're all safe
in this room, don't you?

1433
01:14:49,885 --> 01:14:51,720
Uh-huh.

1434
01:14:51,720 --> 01:14:52,972
[Glover] Let's go right. Moving on.

1435
01:14:52,972 --> 01:14:56,726
Step right this way.

1436
01:14:56,726 --> 01:14:59,437
So as you can see,

1437
01:14:59,437 --> 01:15:01,731
there is simply no
opportunity for theft,

1438
01:15:01,731 --> 01:15:04,108
which is why there's
never been a theft

1439
01:15:04,108 --> 01:15:07,028
of even a single note
at this facility

1440
01:15:07,028 --> 01:15:08,238
and there never will be.

1441
01:15:08,238 --> 01:15:10,073
Right.

1442
01:15:11,825 --> 01:15:14,077
Look,

1443
01:15:14,077 --> 01:15:19,207
these are not
white-collar people.

1444
01:15:19,207 --> 01:15:21,293
They would have to
physically steal the money,

1445
01:15:21,293 --> 01:15:22,878
which I just told you
is impossible.

1446
01:15:22,878 --> 01:15:25,506
You're talking about
women who...

1447
01:15:25,506 --> 01:15:26,382
change trash bags.

1448
01:15:26,382 --> 01:15:28,717
They push carts around,

1449
01:15:28,717 --> 01:15:33,764
drop paper in a hole
eight hours a day.

1450
01:15:33,764 --> 01:15:35,266
You got to admit it's
kind of impressive, though.

1451
01:15:35,266 --> 01:15:37,059
Impressive?

1452
01:15:37,059 --> 01:15:38,352
Yeah, I mean, these people
have managed to acquire

1453
01:15:38,352 --> 01:15:41,481
enormous sums of
unaccounted for cash,

1454
01:15:41,481 --> 01:15:42,774
and no one can
figure out how.

1455
01:15:42,774 --> 01:15:45,276
Isn't that odd? Are you
a little curious about that?

1456
01:15:45,276 --> 01:15:48,279
Yes. So what we need to
do is get the KCPD on them,

1457
01:15:48,279 --> 01:15:49,656
find out what
they're up to.

1458
01:15:49,656 --> 01:15:51,992
We have...for months.

1459
01:15:51,992 --> 01:15:56,329
You've been watching
them for months...

1460
01:15:56,329 --> 01:15:57,748
and nobody told me?

1461
01:15:57,748 --> 01:16:00,876
Yeah. We believe one of your
staff has been compromised.

1462
01:16:00,876 --> 01:16:03,420
We had to assume the entire
security squad was corrupt.

1463
01:16:03,420 --> 01:16:06,590
How the hell dare you come
in here slinging allegations

1464
01:16:06,590 --> 01:16:08,801
when you have nothing?

1465
01:16:08,842 --> 01:16:10,344
No evidence.

1466
01:16:10,344 --> 01:16:12,263
They could have gotten this
money any number of ways.

1467
01:16:12,263 --> 01:16:15,391
They--they could be involved
with drugs, computer crime?

1468
01:16:15,391 --> 01:16:18,102
Well, they could have gotten
it turning in cans for deposit,

1469
01:16:18,102 --> 01:16:19,729
but they work at a bank.

1470
01:16:19,729 --> 01:16:21,230
Actually, your bank.

1471
01:16:21,230 --> 01:16:22,899
You listen to me.

1472
01:16:22,899 --> 01:16:26,069
I run the tightest lockdown
this side of Fort Knox!

1473
01:16:26,069 --> 01:16:28,029
And until you can
prove otherwise,

1474
01:16:28,029 --> 01:16:31,574
you get your glorified
paper-pushing ass out of here

1475
01:16:31,574 --> 01:16:34,911
and let some real men
do their damn jobs!

1476
01:16:38,790 --> 01:16:40,500
You know, I hope for
your sake you're right,

1477
01:16:40,500 --> 01:16:43,420
and I hope this place is as airtight
as you seem to wanna believe it is,

1478
01:16:43,420 --> 01:16:45,923
and I hope that you're
not a part of a conspiracy

1479
01:16:45,923 --> 01:16:47,424
to steal from
the Federal Government,

1480
01:16:47,424 --> 01:16:48,842
because that
would be a crime

1481
01:16:48,842 --> 01:16:51,762
punishable to the fullest
extent of the law.

1482
01:16:51,762 --> 01:16:53,097
You will be
held accountable.

1483
01:16:57,727 --> 01:16:59,604
He's a Federal Bank
examiner.

1484
01:16:59,604 --> 01:17:03,566
Mindy Arbogast called
of course.

1485
01:17:03,566 --> 01:17:05,276
He's talking to
all of our neighbors.

1486
01:17:05,276 --> 01:17:07,362
What was he asking?

1487
01:17:07,362 --> 01:17:10,323
How we make our money.
What I do for a living.

1488
01:17:10,323 --> 01:17:12,659
Are you sure it's
the same guy from the party?

1489
01:17:12,659 --> 01:17:15,078
Yes. Yes, I am sure it's
the guy from the party.

1490
01:17:15,078 --> 01:17:16,496
All right.
What we need to do

1491
01:17:16,496 --> 01:17:17,956
is we need to talk
to a lawyer.

1492
01:17:17,956 --> 01:17:18,999
We'll give ourselves up.

1493
01:17:18,999 --> 01:17:21,710
We are not going
to do that. Mm-mmm.

1494
01:17:21,710 --> 01:17:23,337
No. No, no, honey,
listen to me.

1495
01:17:23,337 --> 01:17:26,465
Look, we still have most
of the money, right?

1496
01:17:26,465 --> 01:17:27,675
So we'll give it back,

1497
01:17:27,675 --> 01:17:29,677
and we'll negotiate
some kind of,

1498
01:17:29,677 --> 01:17:31,011
you know,
suspended sentences

1499
01:17:31,011 --> 01:17:32,346
or something like that,
all right?

1500
01:17:32,346 --> 01:17:35,057
Don, I can't do that.
We cannot do that.

1501
01:17:35,057 --> 01:17:36,851
Bridget, please.
Look...

1502
01:17:36,851 --> 01:17:38,519
We have so few
cards to play.

1503
01:17:38,519 --> 01:17:41,564
Honey, it's not
shoplifting.

1504
01:17:41,564 --> 01:17:43,024
It's a federal crime.

1505
01:17:43,024 --> 01:17:47,320
Don! We can't turn
ourselves in because...

1506
01:17:47,320 --> 01:17:50,073
they're gonna take
Nina's kids away.

1507
01:17:55,036 --> 01:17:57,998
And, uh...

1508
01:17:57,998 --> 01:17:59,249
she'd kill me.

1509
01:18:02,795 --> 01:18:05,422
No. Bob...

1510
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:07,508
it is not a surveillance blimp.

1511
01:18:07,508 --> 01:18:09,426
<i>Don?
[groans]</i>

1512
01:18:09,426 --> 01:18:10,886
<i>Don't worry.
I'll call you right back.</i>

1513
01:18:10,886 --> 01:18:12,471
I'm going to jail.

1514
01:18:14,265 --> 01:18:16,267
No. No.
No, I'm not. No, I'm not.

1515
01:18:26,402 --> 01:18:28,530
I am telling you
if they had any evidence,

1516
01:18:28,530 --> 01:18:30,407
they would have
arrested us already,

1517
01:18:30,407 --> 01:18:31,992
and they're
just fishing.

1518
01:18:31,992 --> 01:18:34,077
So I'm saying
we were careful, correct?

1519
01:18:34,077 --> 01:18:37,330
Everybody spent within
the cover stories, right?

1520
01:18:37,330 --> 01:18:39,958
Do investments count
as spending?

1521
01:18:39,958 --> 01:18:41,752
What investments?

1522
01:18:41,752 --> 01:18:44,088
You said be
a day trader.

1523
01:18:44,088 --> 01:18:46,548
No, we didn't.
Oh, boy!

1524
01:18:46,548 --> 01:18:49,301
We said pretend to be a day trader.
- Yeah.

1525
01:18:49,301 --> 01:18:51,428
Well, I was...

1526
01:18:51,428 --> 01:18:53,347
you know, getting
into character, right?

1527
01:18:53,347 --> 01:18:54,473
And I set up
this portfolio.

1528
01:18:54,473 --> 01:18:56,267
The Bob Fund.

1529
01:18:56,267 --> 01:18:57,393
Oh, good God!
- And, uh...

1530
01:18:57,393 --> 01:19:00,730
I am making 17%.

1531
01:19:00,730 --> 01:19:04,734
Did you ever invest amounts
greater than $10,000 at one time?

1532
01:19:04,734 --> 01:19:06,402
Oh, hell yeah!
- You did.

1533
01:19:06,402 --> 01:19:08,446
Like big mondo
chunks, man!

1534
01:19:08,446 --> 01:19:10,407
Yeah, totally!

1535
01:19:10,407 --> 01:19:13,118
I'm looking to make
the large green, hombre.

1536
01:19:13,118 --> 01:19:15,162
You think I like thinking
of my wife on her feet

1537
01:19:15,162 --> 01:19:18,498
from nine to five every day
ripping off the government?

1538
01:19:22,044 --> 01:19:23,504
This is bad, right?

1539
01:19:24,963 --> 01:19:27,174
Transactions
over $10,000

1540
01:19:27,174 --> 01:19:29,927
are automatically
reported to the IRS!

1541
01:19:29,927 --> 01:19:31,303
How many times
do I have to say that?

1542
01:19:31,303 --> 01:19:33,013
Well, I didn't--
I didn't know that.

1543
01:19:33,013 --> 01:19:37,518
Look, you cannot blame me
for things I didn't know.

1544
01:19:37,518 --> 01:19:38,519
That would not
be fair.

1545
01:19:38,519 --> 01:19:40,313
All right, look,

1546
01:19:40,313 --> 01:19:42,523
it doesn't prove
one thing.

1547
01:19:42,523 --> 01:19:44,943
They can't arrest us
without evidence.

1548
01:19:44,943 --> 01:19:47,529
What about the piles of
cash in our houses?

1549
01:19:47,529 --> 01:19:50,532
I mean, you don't think that
might be a little problem?

1550
01:19:50,532 --> 01:19:51,700
Uh, well--

1551
01:19:51,700 --> 01:19:53,118
We're gonna have to
get rid of it...tonight.

1552
01:19:53,118 --> 01:19:55,495
No. We'll take it
with us.

1553
01:19:55,495 --> 01:19:56,872
We'll run. We'll get
new identities.

1554
01:19:56,872 --> 01:19:59,124
Good.
- No. Shut up, will you?

1555
01:19:59,124 --> 01:20:00,042
What do you mean run?
To where?

1556
01:20:00,042 --> 01:20:01,168
What so we tell our kids?

1557
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:02,544
Like they ever call us?

1558
01:20:02,544 --> 01:20:05,589
It's too late.
- They're already watching us.

1559
01:20:05,589 --> 01:20:07,591
There was blimp over our house.
- Bob!

1560
01:20:10,761 --> 01:20:11,762
Come on.

1561
01:20:11,762 --> 01:20:14,640
Bridget, please.

1562
01:20:14,640 --> 01:20:16,100
We worked so hard.

1563
01:20:16,100 --> 01:20:19,061
And that's it?

1564
01:20:19,061 --> 01:20:20,021
Whew!

1565
01:20:23,483 --> 01:20:24,943
We'll be all right.
We'll be all right.

1566
01:20:24,943 --> 01:20:26,444
She'll--she'll do it...
really.

1567
01:20:26,444 --> 01:20:28,780
Did you say 17%?

1568
01:20:28,780 --> 01:20:30,365
17%.

1569
01:20:30,365 --> 01:20:32,784
My God,
that's unbelievable.

1570
01:20:34,286 --> 01:20:36,371
What, are you mad, babe?

1571
01:20:37,622 --> 01:20:39,917
This is crazy.

1572
01:20:39,917 --> 01:20:41,793
Listen, Nina,

1573
01:20:41,793 --> 01:20:44,463
I know cops from work,

1574
01:20:44,463 --> 01:20:47,007
how they do things.

1575
01:20:47,007 --> 01:20:48,717
What happens when they
don't have enough evidence

1576
01:20:48,717 --> 01:20:51,595
is they try and get one of us
to roll over against the other,

1577
01:20:51,595 --> 01:20:53,806
testify.

1578
01:20:53,806 --> 01:20:57,518
The thing is
they only need one.

1579
01:20:57,518 --> 01:21:00,938
Whoever rolls over first
gets the deal.

1580
01:21:00,938 --> 01:21:03,358
First-time offender,
single mom,

1581
01:21:03,358 --> 01:21:07,570
they might deal you down to
probation if you roll now, alone.

1582
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,073
I can't--
I can't do that.

1583
01:21:10,073 --> 01:21:11,408

The boys...

01:21:17,456 --> 01:21:20,500
you should know
how it works.

1587
01:21:25,506 --> 01:21:28,259
We could do it, you know.

1588
01:21:28,259 --> 01:21:29,134
Get away.

1589
01:21:31,929 --> 01:21:32,805
I don't want to.

1590
01:21:32,805 --> 01:21:35,057
No?

1591
01:21:35,057 --> 01:21:36,601
I mean, I'm sorry,
but I--

1592
01:21:36,601 --> 01:21:40,021
I can't live with it just hanging
over us the rest of our life.

1593
01:21:40,021 --> 01:21:41,564
I'm not sorry
we did it,

1594
01:21:41,564 --> 01:21:44,734
but I really...

1595
01:21:44,734 --> 01:21:46,110
I'd really like this
part to be over.

1596
01:21:57,164 --> 01:21:59,625
Hang on.

1597
01:21:59,625 --> 01:22:01,376
Yeah, we are in
a police state.

1598
01:22:01,376 --> 01:22:02,669
No, we're not
in a police state.

Oh, no!

do about that?

When you're indicted,

1670

we'll put them into
the foster care system.

01:27:07,070 --> 01:27:09,572
Now, the district
attorney can help you

1672

01:27:17,038 --> 01:27:18,915
Hi.

01:27:18,915 --> 01:27:20,250
Hey.

01:27:22,920 --> 01:27:24,129
How much?

1676
01:27:24,129 --> 01:27:26,006
How much what?

1677
01:27:26,006 --> 01:27:28,509
How much did you take?

1678
01:27:28,509 --> 01:27:30,928
I'm not sure
I know what you mean.

1679
01:27:30,928 --> 01:27:33,889
Why? How much
do you think I took?

1680
01:27:33,889 --> 01:27:35,808
We have no idea.

1681
01:27:35,808 --> 01:27:37,643
Really?
That's right.

1682
01:27:37,643 --> 01:27:39,645
You don't know?
- Nope.

01:27:39,645 --> 01:27:42,231
Oh. Good.

1684
01:27:45,401 --> 01:27:47,779
You can't arrest me.

1685
01:27:47,779 --> 01:27:50,532
You're a bank examiner.

1686
01:27:50,532 --> 01:27:52,367
That's right.
- Right.

1687
01:27:52,367 --> 01:27:53,869
Well, you've done
your homework.

1688
01:27:53,869 --> 01:27:55,203
What do you want?

1689
01:27:55,203 --> 01:27:58,040
I guess I wanna know
what makes someone like you

1690
01:27:58,040 --> 01:28:00,542
decide to do
something like this?

1691
01:28:00,542 --> 01:28:03,796
Well, I have a theory.
- Mm-hmm.

1692
01:28:03,796 --> 01:28:06,423
Crime is contagious.

1693
01:28:09,176 --> 01:28:11,137
Oh, brother.

1694
01:28:11,137 --> 01:28:14,598

You know those two
amazing women-- amazing--

1698
01:28:23,983 --> 01:28:25,318
that they just arrested,

1699
01:28:25,318 --> 01:28:29,572
and--and their families
and my husband?

1700
01:28:29,572 --> 01:28:31,992
They never really
had a shot.

1701
01:28:31,992 --> 01:28:35,912
I mean, they kept trying,
and they did their best,

1702
01:28:35,912 --> 01:28:37,914
but what did they
really get out of it?

1703
01:28:37,914 --> 01:28:40,292
A gigantic
untraceable fortune.

1704
01:28:43,253 --> 01:28:44,838
Prove it.

1705
01:29:07,028 --> 01:29:08,029
Hello?

1706
01:29:15,036 --> 01:29:16,246
I've been told
you want a deal.

1707
01:29:16,246 --> 01:29:17,748
Yes.

1708
01:29:18,957 --> 01:29:21,335
It should have been
a little faster.

1709
01:29:23,253 --> 01:29:24,838
Who?

1710
01:29:24,880 --> 01:29:25,589
The girl.

1711
01:29:28,092 --> 01:29:33,013
Kind of a
hinky plea bargain.

1712
01:29:33,013 --> 01:29:36,851
She says the deal is
you get the walk.

1713
01:29:36,851 --> 01:29:39,562
Full immunity.

1714
01:29:39,562 --> 01:29:41,064
She tells us
everything

1715
01:29:41,064 --> 01:29:43,232
if you get to go home
to your kids.

1716
01:29:51,241 --> 01:29:53,785
Go figure people.

1717
01:29:58,957 --> 01:30:00,792
What do you want?
Bridget, I didn't--

1718
01:30:02,169 --> 01:30:03,545
I need a lawyer.

1719
01:30:03,545 --> 01:30:05,297
I don't do
criminal work, Bridget.

1721
01:30:08,968 --> 01:30:13,139
You take that out of
this house this minute.

1722
01:30:13,139 --> 01:30:14,348
You know, not everybody
is like you.

1723
01:30:14,348 --> 01:30:15,808
Some of us have morals
and standards--

1724
01:30:15,808 --> 01:30:17,143
Shut up, Mindy!

1725
01:30:19,270 --> 01:30:20,563
I'm a tax attorney.

1726
01:30:21,856 --> 01:30:23,942
I know that.

1727
01:30:23,942 --> 01:30:25,985
Excuse me.

1728
01:30:25,985 --> 01:30:27,487
What's going on here?

1729
01:30:27,487 --> 01:30:28,613
Was she represented?

1730
01:30:28,613 --> 01:30:30,407
Deal's done.

1731
01:30:30,407 --> 01:30:32,450
I am this woman's
attorney.

1732
01:30:32,450 --> 01:30:33,994
You're what?

1733
01:30:33,994 --> 01:30:35,162
The deal wasn't with her.

1734
01:30:35,162 --> 01:30:36,705
It was with one of
the other suspects.

1735
01:30:36,705 --> 01:30:38,332
I represent them all.

1736
01:30:38,332 --> 01:30:40,751
And I need to confer
with my clients...now.

1737
01:30:46,757 --> 01:30:48,008
Wait right here.

1738
01:31:02,231 --> 01:31:03,816
You have no case
against my clients.

1739
01:31:03,816 --> 01:31:06,152
We have a confession.

1740
01:31:06,152 --> 01:31:07,737
She'll recant.

1741
01:31:07,779 --> 01:31:09,531
They all will.

1742
01:31:09,531 --> 01:31:11,157
What about the money,
the cars, the houses?

1743
01:31:11,157 --> 01:31:12,909
There's no law against
having money.

1744
01:31:12,909 --> 01:31:14,995
Can you prove they stole it?

1745
01:31:14,995 --> 01:31:16,288
Of course
they stole it.

1746
01:31:18,665 --> 01:31:19,791
Did they?

1747
01:31:19,791 --> 01:31:22,794
These women robbed
your bank for three years

1748
01:31:22,794 --> 01:31:24,379
without setting off
a single alarm?

1749
01:31:24,379 --> 01:31:27,007
Is that what happened,
Mr. Glover?

1750
01:31:29,051 --> 01:31:30,845
According
to our records,

1751
01:31:30,845 --> 01:31:33,806
all currency that was
due to be destroyed...

1752
01:31:33,806 --> 01:31:35,349
was destroyed.

1753
01:31:38,186 --> 01:31:42,315
The Fed is a totally
secure institution.

1754
01:31:46,528 --> 01:31:48,238
We watch everyone...

1755
01:31:48,238 --> 01:31:50,240

1756
01:31:50,240 --> 01:31:51,866
every minute.

[groans]

1758
01:31:53,118 --> 01:31:58,206
It is impossible to remove
currency from our system.

1759
01:32:02,419 --> 01:32:06,048
There's no evidence the crime
was even committed.

1760
01:32:06,048 --> 01:32:08,592
You should never
have arrested them.

1761
01:32:08,592 --> 01:32:11,637
Not so fast,

Ever hear of U.S. Code
Section 7201?

1764
01:32:19,228 --> 01:32:20,188
[sighs]

1765
01:32:23,650 --> 01:32:24,692
Yeah.

1766
01:32:28,113 --> 01:32:30,615
Well, Bridget,
you were right.

1767
01:32:30,615 --> 01:32:31,825
You didn't pay taxes.

1768
01:32:31,825 --> 01:32:33,451
On stolen money?

1769
01:32:33,451 --> 01:32:35,871
I didn't hear that.

1770
01:32:35,871 --> 01:32:39,750
The IRS is offering
what I consider...

1771
01:32:39,750 --> 01:32:40,542
a good deal.

1772
01:32:40,542 --> 01:32:43,587
No jail time.

1773
01:32:43,587 --> 01:32:45,756
[Don]
Oh! Oh, thank you!

1774
01:32:45,756 --> 01:32:49,385
But the fines and the penalties
will wipe you out.

1775
01:32:49,385 --> 01:32:51,470
You can walk away
from this if...

1776
01:32:51,470 --> 01:32:53,848
you walk empty-handed.

1777
01:32:53,848 --> 01:32:55,349
[siren]

1778
01:33:00,021 --> 01:33:02,899
[chattering]

1779
01:33:06,569 --> 01:33:09,280
I didn't think we'd
be coming out of there.

1780
01:33:09,280 --> 01:33:12,033
Christ, Arbogast,
he is so good.

1781
01:33:12,033 --> 01:33:13,618
I had no idea.

1782
01:33:30,511 --> 01:33:35,391
You didn't really think that I
would leave you in there, did you?

1783
01:33:35,391 --> 01:33:37,059
Yeah.

1784
01:33:37,059 --> 01:33:39,437
[laughing]

1785
01:33:39,437 --> 01:33:41,731
One hell of a ride, huh?

1786
01:33:41,731 --> 01:33:43,900
Yeah.

1787
01:33:43,900 --> 01:33:45,193
Hell of a ride.

1788
01:33:48,363 --> 01:33:50,782
Bye-bye.
- Bye.

1789
01:33:50,782 --> 01:33:52,993
Bye, Nina.
Barry.

1790
01:33:54,536 --> 01:33:55,954
[Nina]
Come on, boys.

1791
01:34:20,688 --> 01:34:22,190
<i># [blues]</i>

1792
01:34:26,319 --> 01:34:28,988
Hey, Junior.
- Hey, hey.

1793
01:34:28,988 --> 01:34:29,948
Long time no see.

1794
01:34:29,948 --> 01:34:32,033
I know. The place
is looking nice.

1795
01:34:32,033 --> 01:34:33,201
Yes, it is,
isn't it?

1796
01:34:43,921 --> 01:34:45,547
Hey, Bridget.

1797
01:34:45,547 --> 01:34:47,216
Oh!

1798
01:34:49,635 --> 01:34:51,470
Jackie!
- Jackie!

1799
01:34:53,389 --> 01:34:56,225
How you doing, girl?
I've missed you.

1800
01:34:56,225 --> 01:34:58,477
How was the honeymoon?

1801
01:34:58,477 --> 01:34:59,854
Was it?
Yeah, tell.

1802
01:34:59,854 --> 01:35:03,066
Two very fine days.

1803
01:35:04,525 --> 01:35:05,902
That's it.

1804
01:35:05,902 --> 01:35:08,154
Oh, and the five of us crammed
up in that tiny apartment.

1805
01:35:08,154 --> 01:35:11,282
Boy, you really got have
a good sense of humor.

1806
01:35:11,282 --> 01:35:13,577
And we got
the two incomes, so...

1807
01:35:13,577 --> 01:35:14,870
I can't complain.

1808
01:35:14,870 --> 01:35:16,371
Wow.
- Wow.

1809
01:35:18,540 --> 01:35:21,752
Well, Bob got his job back.
- Okay!

1810
01:35:21,752 --> 01:35:23,504
And I'm waitressing.

1811
01:35:23,504 --> 01:35:25,756
And we figure
in five years,

1812
01:35:25,756 --> 01:35:27,216
we're going
to South America.

1813
01:35:27,216 --> 01:35:28,384
We're driving all
the way to the bottom.

1814
01:35:28,384 --> 01:35:29,802
There you go.

1815
01:35:31,178 --> 01:35:32,555
Junior--
- There you go, ladies.

1816
01:35:34,265 --> 01:35:35,433
This one's
on the house.

1817
01:35:35,433 --> 01:35:36,893
Like old times.

1818
01:35:36,893 --> 01:35:38,060
No shit.

1819
01:35:38,060 --> 01:35:40,855
We're going back to...

1820
01:35:40,855 --> 01:35:42,565
work?

1821
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:46,027
Bob has access
to a lot of beef.

1822
01:35:47,445 --> 01:35:49,406
No. No.

1823
01:35:49,406 --> 01:35:51,366
No.

1824
01:35:51,366 --> 01:35:52,701
Okay.
- Yes, no.

1825
01:35:52,701 --> 01:35:54,119
Okay.

1826
01:35:54,119 --> 01:35:56,037
But we're moving.

1827
01:35:56,037 --> 01:35:57,873
To the Caribbean.

1828
01:35:57,873 --> 01:35:59,291
We're gonna open a little
bed-and-breakfast.

1829
01:35:59,291 --> 01:36:00,918
I'm gonna cook.

1830
01:36:00,918 --> 01:36:02,294
Don's gonna manage it
of course.

1831
01:36:02,294 --> 01:36:03,921
We've been talking
about this for years.

1832
01:36:03,921 --> 01:36:05,631
But we're just
kinda waiting

1833
01:36:05,672 --> 01:36:07,174
until it's not..,
so hot.

1834
01:36:09,677 --> 01:36:10,511
Hot?

1835
01:36:11,929 --> 01:36:12,763
It's chilly out.

1836
01:36:12,763 --> 01:36:14,557
Yeah.

1837
01:36:14,557 --> 01:36:17,226
Hey, wait. Did you ever hear
that expression "mad money?"

1838
01:36:17,226 --> 01:36:19,312
My mother used to say,
"Every woman should keep

1839
01:36:19,312 --> 01:36:21,773
a little mad money
tucked away just in case."

1840
01:36:21,773 --> 01:36:25,276
Do you use mad money
when you go mad

1841
01:36:25,276 --> 01:36:28,113
or when you get mad?

1842
01:36:28,113 --> 01:36:31,366
Why don't you
decide for yourself?

1843
01:36:31,366 --> 01:36:32,617
Junior?

1844
01:36:32,617 --> 01:36:33,618
[Junior] Uh-huh!
- Come on.

1845
01:36:35,078 --> 01:36:37,247
Watch your step.

1846
01:36:37,247 --> 01:36:39,541
Do you know?
- No.

1847
01:36:39,541 --> 01:36:42,711
What are you up to?
Why are we down here?

1848
01:36:42,711 --> 01:36:45,172
Relax. You just have to
have a little patience.

1849
01:36:47,341 --> 01:36:48,968
Does this
look familiar?

1850
01:36:50,636 --> 01:36:51,804
Oh!

1851
01:36:58,728 --> 01:37:00,104
Holy shit!
- Oh!

1852
01:37:00,104 --> 01:37:03,024
Who did it?
- I did! Me!

1853
01:37:07,612 --> 01:37:09,614
Oh, my God!

1854
01:37:09,614 --> 01:37:13,869

criminal mastermind!

1855
