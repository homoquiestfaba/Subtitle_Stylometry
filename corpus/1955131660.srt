1
00:00:27,495 --> 00:00:31,597
No, no, no...

2
00:00:31,599 --> 00:00:33,365
I found the dress, Nina!

3
00:00:33,367 --> 00:00:35,834
Fucking meth heads,
This is a size four.

4
00:00:35,836 --> 00:00:37,770
It's a plus size dress.

5
00:00:37,772 --> 00:00:39,972
It would probably fit you.

6
00:00:39,974 --> 00:00:44,843
Anything else, or is this...
a wasted day?

7
00:01:00,261 --> 00:01:02,795
Isn't it divine?

8
00:01:02,797 --> 00:01:04,530
It's Prada.

9
00:01:04,532 --> 00:01:06,932
Isn't it divine?

10
00:01:06,934 --> 00:01:09,902
It's Prada!

11
00:01:11,105 --> 00:01:13,439
Isn't it divine?

12
00:01:14,108 --> 00:01:16,542
It's Prada!

13
00:01:16,544 --> 00:01:18,510
Nina gave it to me,
just for being super cool,

14
00:01:18,512 --> 00:01:21,246
plus it didn't fit
any of the models.

15
00:01:21,248 --> 00:01:25,350
My God,
it's fucking hot in here.

16
00:01:25,352 --> 00:01:27,519
Smells like ass.
I'm cold.

17
00:01:27,521 --> 00:01:30,456
Make-up.
Effortless chic.

18
00:01:30,458 --> 00:01:35,094
Come on, please?
Please, you're so good at it!

19
00:01:35,096 --> 00:01:38,464
-No.
-Come on.

20
00:01:38,466 --> 00:01:40,532
Get up, get up, get up.

21
00:01:41,669 --> 00:01:44,670
Come on, do my face.

22
00:01:46,440 --> 00:01:49,575
I don't know how you work
in the fashion industry.

23
00:01:49,577 --> 00:01:52,411
They totally objectify women.

24
00:01:52,413 --> 00:01:54,446
Says the fat girl.

25
00:01:56,584 --> 00:01:58,417
I'm not fat.

26
00:02:00,254 --> 00:02:02,554
Actually, you're not.
You're just not toned.

27
00:02:02,556 --> 00:02:05,057
You just need to do some pilates.
Some leg lifts.

28
00:02:05,059 --> 00:02:07,893
Yeah.
Cuz I never eat.

29
00:02:07,895 --> 00:02:10,329
I don't know how you do that.

30
00:02:16,570 --> 00:02:18,670
Come out with me tonight.

31
00:02:18,672 --> 00:02:20,739
No.

32
00:02:20,741 --> 00:02:23,442
Rob will be there.

33
00:02:23,444 --> 00:02:24,943
So?

34
00:02:24,945 --> 00:02:27,546
What the fuck is wrong with you?

35
00:02:27,548 --> 00:02:33,886
-You know I, it's...
-He's nice, and he likes you.

36
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:36,021
-You would know.
-Yeah, I would.

37
00:02:36,023 --> 00:02:38,857
He did nothing but talk
about you the other night.

38
00:02:38,859 --> 00:02:40,726
Yeah, that's not all he did.

39
00:02:40,728 --> 00:02:43,228
Ouch!
Bitch!

40
00:02:43,230 --> 00:02:45,130
Nothing happened
but a little rubbing.

41
00:02:45,132 --> 00:02:48,000
He came and then we passed out.

42
00:02:49,770 --> 00:02:53,505
Admit it,
he makes your pussy wet.

43
00:02:55,176 --> 00:03:01,046
He does, yeah he do. Come
on, admit it, you like him.

44
00:03:01,048 --> 00:03:04,616
All right, yeah I do.

45
00:03:05,819 --> 00:03:10,756
A little...
Just stay away.

46
00:03:10,758 --> 00:03:13,525
You're not down
for my sloppy seconds?

47
00:03:14,628 --> 00:03:17,896
Girl, come on,
I'm just joking.

48
00:03:19,133 --> 00:03:22,601
Okay, the other night I was
fucked up, I wasn't thinking.

49
00:03:22,603 --> 00:03:24,136
You know how I get.

50
00:03:24,138 --> 00:03:26,972
Yeah, I do.

51
00:03:26,974 --> 00:03:29,675
I promise,
I'll keep my hands off.

52
00:03:30,578 --> 00:03:32,744
Pinky swear.

53
00:03:32,746 --> 00:03:34,246
Pinky swear.

54
00:03:42,756 --> 00:03:44,223
Come out with me tonight.

55
00:03:44,225 --> 00:03:46,892
No, you stay in with me.

56
00:03:46,894 --> 00:03:49,428
We'll make popcorn
and we'll watch A Time to Kill.

57
00:03:49,430 --> 00:03:54,032
Girl, you know Matthew
McConaughey makes me splash.

58
00:03:54,034 --> 00:03:56,335
-Brownies?
-Stop it.

59
00:03:56,337 --> 00:03:58,770
-Ice cream?
-Jill.

60
00:03:58,772 --> 00:04:01,173
Cold sweet pink wine.

61
00:04:01,175 --> 00:04:02,641
Barbecue potato chips.

62
00:04:02,643 --> 00:04:04,109
Cool Whip.

63
00:04:04,111 --> 00:04:07,246
Gummy Bears, french fries.

64
00:04:07,248 --> 00:04:09,648
-Chili.
-Sour cream.

65
00:04:09,650 --> 00:04:11,950
-And butter.
-And mayonnaise.

66
00:04:14,455 --> 00:04:16,922
-Pop tarts.
-With chili...

67
00:04:16,924 --> 00:04:21,827
and sour cream,
and butter, and mayonnaise.

68
00:04:42,082 --> 00:04:45,917
Come stay here with me.

69
00:04:48,722 --> 00:04:52,257
God.
Don't be such a boring bitch!

70
00:04:52,259 --> 00:04:54,660
Come out with me.
I can't.

71
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,331
Fine.

72
00:04:59,333 --> 00:05:00,732
Just do my face.

73
00:07:10,063 --> 00:07:12,030
lifestyle and attitudes...

74
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:23,041
The beautiful,
the bored, the broken.

75
00:07:23,043 --> 00:07:25,143
They are my muses.

76
00:07:47,034 --> 00:07:48,834
Dinner is served, bitches.

77
00:07:48,836 --> 00:07:51,903
It's bouillon. It's all they eat
in.

78
00:07:51,905 --> 00:07:53,438
Hey, you know what?

79
00:07:53,440 --> 00:07:56,475
I do not need...

80
00:07:56,477 --> 00:07:57,509
Right?

81
00:07:57,511 --> 00:08:00,779
But she looked amazing.
Amazing!

82
00:08:00,781 --> 00:08:02,414
No.

83
00:08:08,789 --> 00:08:10,956
I heard that this
is all she eats.

84
00:08:10,958 --> 00:08:12,357
Please.

85
00:08:12,359 --> 00:08:15,494
It's cut, cut, snip, snip.
Ga, ga, right?

86
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:18,263
Whatev.
I applaud her effort.

87
00:08:24,004 --> 00:08:25,504
Self control.

88
00:08:27,641 --> 00:08:29,174
The discipline.

89
00:08:29,176 --> 00:08:32,277
Come on,
she still has work to do.

90
00:09:01,842 --> 00:09:03,642
There are olives in this drink.

91
00:09:03,644 --> 00:09:05,010
You saw me eat the bouillon.

92
00:09:05,012 --> 00:09:07,212
Are you trying
to sabotage me Adriana?

93
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:11,483
You are so good at this.

94
00:09:46,019 --> 00:09:49,921
Sorry. Sorry. Sorry.

95
00:09:51,291 --> 00:09:53,024
Are you okay?

96
00:09:53,026 --> 00:09:54,292
Yeah.

97
00:09:54,294 --> 00:09:55,360
Yeah?

98
00:09:55,362 --> 00:09:58,897
Too much to drink or did you
try some of the bouillon?

99
00:10:00,500 --> 00:10:03,435
I don't know what that is.

100
00:10:03,437 --> 00:10:06,638
I think it's soup.
I think it's soup.

101
00:10:12,846 --> 00:10:16,247
I'm not really good
at networking.

102
00:10:16,249 --> 00:10:18,450
Well, everyone here seems
to be pretty preoccupied.

103
00:10:18,452 --> 00:10:20,285
So, good job.

104
00:10:24,758 --> 00:10:30,629
It's like, have you ever seen
that, Last Year at Marienbad?

105
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:31,896
What's that?

106
00:10:31,898 --> 00:10:35,934
It's a movie, black and white.
Yes...

107
00:10:35,936 --> 00:10:38,411
No, no. Tell me. I don't
watch a lot of movies.

108
00:10:38,412 --> 00:10:39,237
Never mind.

109
00:10:39,239 --> 00:10:41,706
Me too.
I don't either.

110
00:10:45,512 --> 00:10:48,813
So anyway,
are you gonna tell me?

111
00:10:48,815 --> 00:10:50,915
You gonna...

112
00:10:50,917 --> 00:10:52,384
Please?

113
00:10:56,857 --> 00:11:01,593
Everyone talks in... riddles.

114
00:11:01,595 --> 00:11:05,330
Cuz they're not real, they're just
like fragments, like symbols,

115
00:11:05,332 --> 00:11:06,865
or like fragments of memories.

116
00:11:06,867 --> 00:11:09,901
Or what, I don't even know.
It's totally post modern.

117
00:11:15,142 --> 00:11:16,741
What?..

118
00:11:26,620 --> 00:11:28,653
You coming back to the party?

119
00:11:30,957 --> 00:11:33,758
Shit, shit.

120
00:11:33,760 --> 00:11:35,160
What?

121
00:11:35,162 --> 00:11:40,098
I said your name's Jill, right?
It's your party?

122
00:11:40,100 --> 00:11:41,166
No, it's not.

123
00:11:41,168 --> 00:11:42,934
No. Not really.

124
00:11:42,936 --> 00:11:44,736
I just insulted your friends.

125
00:11:44,738 --> 00:11:47,005
Nope.
They're Jennifer's friends.

126
00:11:47,007 --> 00:11:48,339
Yeah.

127
00:11:48,341 --> 00:11:50,675
I only met
one cute girl here tonight.

128
00:11:50,677 --> 00:11:54,446
Listen, nothing Jennifer
says about me is true.

129
00:11:58,585 --> 00:12:00,452
You should look for her.

130
00:12:00,454 --> 00:12:02,887
What, what, what did you say?

131
00:12:02,889 --> 00:12:04,222
You should look for her!

132
00:12:04,224 --> 00:12:06,057
I am.

133
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:07,859
Have you seen her?

134
00:12:08,662 --> 00:12:11,529
Nobody in here but me.

135
00:12:11,531 --> 00:12:16,267
I know. So are you coming
back to the party?

136
00:12:25,212 --> 00:12:27,378
Come on let yourself go.

137
00:12:43,797 --> 00:12:46,631
Hey, I hope it wasn't
something I said.

138
00:12:58,078 --> 00:13:00,912
No, no, it wasn't you.

139
00:13:00,914 --> 00:13:03,014
Are you okay?

140
00:13:11,024 --> 00:13:14,692
All right. I guess we're done
talking for now.

141
00:13:14,694 --> 00:13:17,762
I think that's a good idea.

142
00:13:17,764 --> 00:13:20,398
Well, when you're done in there,
you come find me.

143
00:13:20,400 --> 00:13:22,167
Or I'll come find you.

144
00:13:26,606 --> 00:13:28,406
Feel better.

145
00:14:10,817 --> 00:14:12,750
No, no no.

146
00:14:15,255 --> 00:14:16,588
Come on.

147
00:14:17,991 --> 00:14:20,024
God...

148
00:14:23,997 --> 00:14:25,897
Hey.

149
00:14:27,667 --> 00:14:31,736
I was gonna get a rag
to clean that up, but I...

150
00:14:31,738 --> 00:14:33,137
I passed out.

151
00:14:33,139 --> 00:14:34,772
I'm sorry.

152
00:14:34,774 --> 00:14:36,875
All right.

153
00:14:39,079 --> 00:14:41,246
Is that my T shirt?

154
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,817
Are you okay?

155
00:14:45,819 --> 00:14:47,051
If I could...

156
00:14:47,053 --> 00:14:50,188
Don't touch me.
Don't!

157
00:14:50,190 --> 00:14:52,190
I'm sorry.

158
00:14:52,191 --> 00:14:54,191
You know stop, don't apologize.
Why are you apologizing?

159
00:14:54,194 --> 00:14:58,380
I won't apologize again.

160
00:14:58,381 --> 00:15:02,567
All right. I just though we might've
had a connection last night.

161
00:15:02,569 --> 00:15:04,068
What did you do?

162
00:15:04,070 --> 00:15:05,436
Okay, that's lame.

163
00:15:05,438 --> 00:15:07,605
I'm sorry.

164
00:15:10,010 --> 00:15:13,177
Can I have my t-shirt back?

165
00:15:14,881 --> 00:15:16,581
No, keep it.

166
00:15:17,450 --> 00:15:21,185
A connection.
You connected with pussy.

167
00:15:23,857 --> 00:15:26,057
What has happened to you?

168
00:15:41,074 --> 00:15:44,075
Wait! I just want to talk
to you, just for a second.

169
00:15:44,077 --> 00:15:46,711
It's about the complex's
party policy.

170
00:15:48,515 --> 00:15:51,082
You're just going to ignore me?

171
00:15:51,084 --> 00:15:53,151
This is super childish.

172
00:15:53,153 --> 00:15:56,721
This is not the way for
adults or neighbors to behave.

173
00:15:58,358 --> 00:16:00,959
I know you're in there.

174
00:17:18,805 --> 00:17:21,239
Where are you?

175
00:17:21,241 --> 00:17:24,275
Well, you know where you're
gonna be in 1.5 hours?

176
00:17:24,277 --> 00:17:26,811
You're gonna be here
in my pussy.

177
00:17:38,658 --> 00:17:40,725
Who was that on the phone?

178
00:17:40,727 --> 00:17:43,294
Steven, of course.
It's Steven kind of week.

179
00:17:50,203 --> 00:17:51,402
What?

180
00:17:52,639 --> 00:17:54,272
Don't you remember?

181
00:17:54,274 --> 00:17:56,274
Fashion waits for no one.

182
00:17:59,679 --> 00:18:01,813
Why didn't you tell
me we're having a party?

183
00:18:02,982 --> 00:18:05,116
Honey.

184
00:18:05,118 --> 00:18:07,051
Did you have fun, right?

185
00:18:07,053 --> 00:18:09,787
You know, I think that guy Rob,
is totally into you.

186
00:18:09,789 --> 00:18:11,355
I think it was perfect.

187
00:18:11,357 --> 00:18:14,225
Until the cops showed up.

188
00:18:14,227 --> 00:18:16,561
Whatever.

189
00:18:16,563 --> 00:18:18,629
You know, we both live here.

190
00:18:18,631 --> 00:18:21,132
My God, not you too.

191
00:18:21,134 --> 00:18:24,202
I already had to dodge
that nosy old Cathy.

192
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:27,338
"I just want to talk about
the complex's party policy."

193
00:18:27,340 --> 00:18:31,042
It's not complicated. I had a
party and you weren't invited.

194
00:18:31,044 --> 00:18:33,044
Noise complaints?

195
00:18:33,046 --> 00:18:34,912
She's a ruiner of fun.

196
00:18:34,914 --> 00:18:37,448
She's not that bad.
She's actually kind of nice.

197
00:18:40,753 --> 00:18:44,355
She's like talking
to a basket of rolls.

198
00:18:44,357 --> 00:18:46,958
And she doesn't get a say
about what goes on in my house.

199
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:49,594
Neither do you
until you, like, get a job.

200
00:18:49,596 --> 00:18:51,796
-I'm trying.
-No you're not.

201
00:18:51,798 --> 00:18:54,198
You're lying around
in your fat and your filth.

202
00:18:54,200 --> 00:18:55,867
Don't be like...

203
00:18:55,869 --> 00:18:58,069
Constructive, motivational?

204
00:18:58,071 --> 00:19:00,438
Destructive and cruel,
you know, like...

205
00:19:00,440 --> 00:19:02,573
I know.
You won't let me forget it.

206
00:19:02,575 --> 00:19:04,375
But you've been here
for nine months already.

207
00:19:04,377 --> 00:19:05,743
So have you.

208
00:19:05,745 --> 00:19:08,279
Not paying rent,
I'd like to add.

209
00:19:08,281 --> 00:19:09,847
You're such a good friend.

210
00:19:09,849 --> 00:19:11,649
Don't kiss my ass, bitch.

211
00:19:11,651 --> 00:19:17,121
It was sarcasm. Anyway, you're
suppose to be helping me.

212
00:19:17,123 --> 00:19:19,524
Here we go.
Blah, blah, blah.

213
00:19:19,526 --> 00:19:22,160
It's so hard, blah, blah.

214
00:19:22,162 --> 00:19:25,596
This town is wide open, so stop your
whining, strap on a six-shooter,

215
00:19:25,598 --> 00:19:27,331
and get to fucking work.

216
00:19:27,333 --> 00:19:28,733
It's easy for you to say.

217
00:19:28,735 --> 00:19:31,435
Yeah, and easy to do,

218
00:19:31,437 --> 00:19:33,738
but you have to
leave the fucking house.

219
00:19:35,375 --> 00:19:38,442
Jill, I am your friend. I...

220
00:19:38,444 --> 00:19:42,246
I'm harsh with you because I respect
you enough to not bullshit the true.

221
00:19:45,118 --> 00:19:46,918
I'm having a hard time.

222
00:19:48,121 --> 00:19:51,055
I don't wanna talk
about this anymore.

223
00:19:51,057 --> 00:19:54,058
This weekend... This weekend we'll sit
down and we'll figure everything out.

224
00:19:54,060 --> 00:19:57,261
Make a total plan for your life,
even give a bitch a makeover.

225
00:19:57,263 --> 00:19:59,163
It's always this weekend.

226
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:02,433
No more, not tonight, Jill.

227
00:20:02,435 --> 00:20:05,703
I just want to watch some TV, finish
my dinner, and wait for Steven.

228
00:20:14,047 --> 00:20:16,347
Trying to get my own hard time.

229
00:20:19,018 --> 00:20:21,686
Wants some?

230
00:20:22,522 --> 00:20:26,724
You're a b...
You're a bitch.

231
00:20:27,727 --> 00:20:29,060
You know that?

232
00:20:29,062 --> 00:20:31,229
I know.

233
00:20:31,231 --> 00:20:33,130
Right.

234
00:21:17,977 --> 00:21:21,846
I don't know I,
I just, I can do better.

235
00:21:21,848 --> 00:21:24,048
You know.

236
00:21:24,050 --> 00:21:26,717
Is that a question?

237
00:21:26,719 --> 00:21:32,657
Right, like I know I'm good,
but what if I felt good too?

238
00:21:32,659 --> 00:21:34,091
I understand.

239
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,694
Is that water?

240
00:21:40,300 --> 00:21:44,669
We're okay, just, I don't know.
You know what I'm saying?

241
00:21:44,671 --> 00:21:46,804
I don't.

242
00:21:48,241 --> 00:21:51,008
Do you know
what a suppository is?

243
00:21:51,010 --> 00:21:52,677
What's that?

244
00:21:52,679 --> 00:21:54,945
Depository, like a bank?

245
00:21:54,947 --> 00:21:56,514
Suppository.

246
00:21:56,516 --> 00:21:58,749
This gets inserted
into your anus.

247
00:21:58,751 --> 00:22:03,120
You're looking at me.
On camera I do that?

248
00:22:25,845 --> 00:22:27,645
This is a test.

249
00:22:27,647 --> 00:22:31,982
This station is conducting a test
of the Emergency Broadcast System.

250
00:22:31,984 --> 00:22:33,684
This is only a test.

251
00:23:59,405 --> 00:24:02,940
Okay, guys,
at the premier of his new movie,

252
00:24:02,942 --> 00:24:07,878
a fan thrust a baby into Zac
Effron's face. Check it out.

253
00:24:07,880 --> 00:24:09,680
That's crazy

254
00:24:09,682 --> 00:24:10,781
Aren't they handsome?

255
00:24:10,783 --> 00:24:12,082
Well its got a big head.

256
00:24:12,084 --> 00:24:14,285
Wait, wait, no.
I think she wants him to...

257
00:27:50,202 --> 00:27:52,236
See you, babe.

258
00:28:27,073 --> 00:28:28,572
Hi.

259
00:28:29,575 --> 00:28:31,575
Why are you up so late?

260
00:28:31,577 --> 00:28:33,577
Mom, it's afternoon.

261
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:47,825
I just had the most horrible
dream about you, darling.

262
00:28:47,827 --> 00:28:51,695
It's a sign.
I think you need to come home.

263
00:28:51,697 --> 00:28:54,198
Fine.

264
00:28:54,200 --> 00:28:56,400
You look washed out.

265
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,937
You shouldn't wear that color.

266
00:29:03,008 --> 00:29:05,642
My God, my God.
Someone's in the house!

267
00:29:05,644 --> 00:29:08,112
Listen!
Listen!

268
00:29:08,114 --> 00:29:10,848
They're coming!
They're coming!

269
00:29:10,850 --> 00:29:13,050
Mommy loves you so much.

270
00:29:13,052 --> 00:29:14,785
So much.

271
00:29:20,659 --> 00:29:22,259
Mom.

272
00:29:25,765 --> 00:29:27,898
It's Daddy.
Daddy's home.

273
00:29:28,801 --> 00:29:30,167
I see him.

274
00:29:30,169 --> 00:29:33,403
You wanna come say hello?

275
00:29:36,108 --> 00:29:38,976
Daddy doesn't,
he doesn't wanna be on camera.

276
00:29:38,978 --> 00:29:42,045
He's shy.
But he's home!

277
00:29:42,047 --> 00:29:44,181
Daddy's home!
Yay!

278
00:29:47,253 --> 00:29:52,222
Why are you home?

279
00:29:52,224 --> 00:29:55,459
What, what, why are you home?
I didn't call you.

280
00:29:55,461 --> 00:30:00,464
I what, I don't,
wait, whats wrong?

281
00:30:00,466 --> 00:30:04,101
Stop messing with my
hair, I fixed it!

282
00:30:05,304 --> 00:30:08,639
I did call you, you need,

283
00:30:08,641 --> 00:30:13,377
you need to convince our
daughter to come home.

284
00:30:13,379 --> 00:30:16,313
Jackson, it's vital.

285
00:30:16,315 --> 00:30:18,081
It's vital.

286
00:30:18,517 --> 00:30:20,484
She's in trouble.

287
00:30:20,486 --> 00:30:21,852
No.

288
00:30:21,854 --> 00:30:23,420
I don't wanna go to bed now.

289
00:30:23,422 --> 00:30:25,823
I don't wanna go to bed.
I don't wanna go to bed.

290
00:30:25,825 --> 00:30:28,058
No, stop it.

291
00:30:29,328 --> 00:30:30,861
No!

292
00:30:54,753 --> 00:30:59,990
I know you hate it when I apologize.
So I present you with this.

293
00:30:59,992 --> 00:31:03,427
I regret the collateral damage.

294
00:31:04,463 --> 00:31:06,530
Shit, you're mad.

295
00:31:17,476 --> 00:31:20,010
I'm making lunch,
do you want some?

296
00:31:25,551 --> 00:31:26,783
This is

297
00:31:29,555 --> 00:31:32,589
This is

298
00:31:34,193 --> 00:31:36,360
You're not gonna have any?

299
00:31:36,362 --> 00:31:38,662
That's all you're having?

300
00:31:38,664 --> 00:31:42,132
No, I don't like
to cook and eat.

301
00:31:43,035 --> 00:31:44,902
Well, let's go out!

302
00:31:44,904 --> 00:31:47,337
Have somebody else cook,
this town is great for food.

303
00:31:49,308 --> 00:31:53,510
So those kids on your Facebook
page, they're not yours.

304
00:31:53,512 --> 00:31:55,345
Fuck no.

305
00:31:55,347 --> 00:31:57,447
I mean, I didn't mean it that way.
I meant it like...

306
00:31:57,449 --> 00:32:00,183
It's just complicated,
all right?

307
00:32:00,185 --> 00:32:03,921
I work for the CFSD.
I worked for the CFSD.

308
00:32:03,923 --> 00:32:06,223
I'm confused.

309
00:32:06,225 --> 00:32:09,459
California Children
and Family Service Division.

310
00:32:11,030 --> 00:32:15,265
Well, just so you know you can see
everything on your Facebook page.

311
00:32:15,267 --> 00:32:16,466
So...

312
00:32:16,468 --> 00:32:19,569
-I'm the worst at social media.
-Yeah.

313
00:32:19,571 --> 00:32:21,905
Someone told me that I actually have
to do something with that stuff.

314
00:32:21,907 --> 00:32:24,875
The privacy settings?

315
00:32:24,877 --> 00:32:26,310
Is that how we know each other?

316
00:32:26,312 --> 00:32:27,611
From Facebook?

317
00:32:27,613 --> 00:32:28,979
Friend of a friend?

318
00:32:31,684 --> 00:32:34,851
Is it bad that I knew
nothing about that at all?

319
00:32:34,853 --> 00:32:37,955
No. I just mean
you have to be careful.

320
00:32:37,957 --> 00:32:39,389
About?

321
00:32:42,828 --> 00:32:46,396
Being too open.

322
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,633
Really? I always thought
that was a good thing.

323
00:32:49,635 --> 00:32:51,168
I don't know.

324
00:32:53,172 --> 00:32:54,905
Did I say something wrong?

325
00:32:57,009 --> 00:33:00,077
What are you talking about?

326
00:33:00,079 --> 00:33:01,411
Shit.

327
00:33:03,515 --> 00:33:06,116
I said too much, yeah?

328
00:33:06,118 --> 00:33:07,918
I'm such a douchebag.

329
00:33:08,587 --> 00:33:10,187
All right, I feel like a douche.

330
00:33:10,189 --> 00:33:12,956
-No.
-My lunch is about over, so.

331
00:33:12,958 --> 00:33:16,093
Did you wanna take
some food home, at least?

332
00:33:16,095 --> 00:33:18,195
-I'd love that.
-Okay.

333
00:33:46,892 --> 00:33:49,326
You know I like you, right?

334
00:33:49,328 --> 00:33:51,094
I mean not like in a
hook up kind of way.

335
00:33:51,096 --> 00:33:52,396
I like you.

336
00:34:05,944 --> 00:34:07,411
That was nice, right?

337
00:34:11,216 --> 00:34:12,682
I don't know.

338
00:34:17,689 --> 00:34:19,890
Thanks for the meal.

339
00:34:19,892 --> 00:34:22,526
We're gonna go out, right?

340
00:34:23,162 --> 00:34:24,728
Okay.

341
00:34:25,931 --> 00:34:29,366
All right, back to the real world.
Whatever that means.

342
00:34:31,370 --> 00:34:33,904
Man, that's corny.
Yeah...

343
00:34:37,042 --> 00:34:38,809
I'm lame.

344
00:34:41,480 --> 00:34:43,146
I warned you about that.

345
00:34:57,329 --> 00:35:00,630
I'm just... gonna clean up.

346
00:35:00,632 --> 00:35:02,032
Go do that.

347
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,193
Fuck!

348
00:35:30,195 --> 00:35:32,062
Creepy bitch.

349
00:35:35,100 --> 00:35:37,601
What?

350
00:35:41,173 --> 00:35:43,106
You're mad.

351
00:35:44,576 --> 00:35:47,210
Don't be mad.

352
00:35:47,212 --> 00:35:50,080
There's nothing wrong
with a little...

353
00:35:53,318 --> 00:35:55,552
I'm starving.

354
00:35:55,554 --> 00:35:57,120
You promised.

355
00:35:58,090 --> 00:36:00,590
You were never fuck him
or his pretty dick.

356
00:36:00,592 --> 00:36:02,526
I couldn't let that go to waste.

357
00:36:02,528 --> 00:36:04,661
But you promised.

358
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:09,299
My fucking God,
are these short ribs?

359
00:36:16,175 --> 00:36:17,574
You promised.

360
00:36:17,576 --> 00:36:19,976
Honey, look.

361
00:36:19,978 --> 00:36:23,246
I'm sorry, I don't know
what came over me.

362
00:36:23,248 --> 00:36:25,582
I can't control myself.

363
00:36:26,885 --> 00:36:28,418
I'm exhausted.

364
00:36:28,420 --> 00:36:32,289
It's probably why I'm being
such a crazy mega bitch.

365
00:36:32,291 --> 00:36:33,924
I'm sorry for it all.

366
00:36:33,926 --> 00:36:40,430
Tomorrow, look, tomorrow I promise,
we'll sit down and talk everything out.

367
00:36:40,432 --> 00:36:42,232
Everything?

368
00:36:42,234 --> 00:36:44,351
Everything.

369
00:36:44,352 --> 00:36:46,469
We'll have a nice meal and
I'll get a good bottle of wine.

370
00:36:46,471 --> 00:36:48,205
And you can cook.

371
00:36:49,775 --> 00:36:53,210
-Tomorrow.
-Prom, tomorrow.

372
00:36:53,212 --> 00:36:55,745
I'm gonna crash.
Goodnight.

373
00:38:52,731 --> 00:38:56,599
Dear Neighbor, I was so
happy when you moved in.

374
00:38:56,601 --> 00:39:01,438
I imagined shared morning
coffees and borrowing sugar.

375
00:39:01,440 --> 00:39:05,342
I at least hoped,
that if we couldn't be friends,

376
00:39:05,344 --> 00:39:09,579
we could be courteous neighbors,
but that has all changed.

377
00:39:09,581 --> 00:39:15,485
You have changed, and it concerns me,
and not just because I live next door.

378
00:39:15,487 --> 00:39:18,121
The party was an
obvious cry for help.

379
00:39:18,123 --> 00:39:21,624
I mean, no offense,
but choose better friends.

380
00:39:21,626 --> 00:39:23,860
I don't want to have
to call someone.

381
00:39:23,862 --> 00:39:26,730
That's not the kind of friend
and neighbor I would want,

382
00:39:26,732 --> 00:39:28,765
so that's not the kind
I'm going to be.

383
00:39:30,235 --> 00:39:34,404
I mean, I know, you're
having a hard time.

384
00:39:35,974 --> 00:39:39,476
I just wanted to send a little gift and
let you know we're thinking about you.

385
00:39:39,478 --> 00:39:43,947
If you ever want to talk,
I am totally here for you.

386
00:39:43,949 --> 00:39:46,182
Push the button.

387
00:39:46,184 --> 00:39:47,884
Call me.

388
00:39:48,920 --> 00:39:50,820
It's a cinch.

389
00:40:22,421 --> 00:40:25,688
What up, Jilly Jill?

390
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,797
Damn.

391
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,566
Romantic.

392
00:40:36,568 --> 00:40:38,334
Where have you been?

393
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,074
What the duck?

394
00:40:51,817 --> 00:40:54,717
God.

395
00:40:54,719 --> 00:40:57,120
That tastes like ass.

396
00:41:00,959 --> 00:41:04,594
It's not fair
what you're doing to me.

397
00:41:04,596 --> 00:41:07,230
We were gonna talk.

398
00:41:08,900 --> 00:41:11,034
I need to talk.

399
00:41:11,036 --> 00:41:14,537
I've been so patient.

400
00:41:14,539 --> 00:41:16,473
Patient?

401
00:41:16,475 --> 00:41:19,509
Don't you go talking to me
ever again about patience.

402
00:41:25,817 --> 00:41:30,453
Patience is one of the seven deadly
sins of not having a fucking life.

403
00:41:40,632 --> 00:41:42,932
You'll never beat me.

404
00:43:34,179 --> 00:43:35,745
Jill?

405
00:43:40,285 --> 00:43:42,318
Jill.

406
00:44:00,271 --> 00:44:02,138
The fuck?!

407
00:44:08,146 --> 00:44:10,213
What the fuck, Jill?

408
00:44:13,518 --> 00:44:15,351
What the fuck?

409
00:44:15,353 --> 00:44:18,087
We need to talk.

410
00:44:18,089 --> 00:44:19,756
Told you.

411
00:44:52,957 --> 00:44:55,692
You're not gonna get away
with this, you know.

412
00:45:03,134 --> 00:45:04,801
Psycho bitch.

413
00:45:24,189 --> 00:45:26,389
Let's talk.

414
00:45:26,391 --> 00:45:29,325
Okay, what do you
want to talk about?

415
00:45:30,528 --> 00:45:33,062
Don't tempt me.

416
00:45:36,568 --> 00:45:38,267
We'll figure it all out.

417
00:45:38,269 --> 00:45:41,104
Don't patronize me, serio.

418
00:45:41,773 --> 00:45:43,539
Don't you dare.

419
00:46:10,902 --> 00:46:13,269
Please stop.

420
00:46:13,271 --> 00:46:14,804
I will help you.

421
00:46:27,552 --> 00:46:30,787
Still moist.

422
00:46:30,789 --> 00:46:32,655
That's just cruel.

423
00:46:58,216 --> 00:46:59,916
La la-la la.

424
00:47:04,322 --> 00:47:06,622
Such a perfect wedding.

425
00:47:06,624 --> 00:47:09,959
You've really crossed the line.

426
00:47:11,963 --> 00:47:13,429
What happened?

427
00:47:13,431 --> 00:47:15,531
Don't go any farther.

428
00:47:35,019 --> 00:47:37,787
You don't want any?

429
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:41,791
It's okay, it's more for me.

430
00:47:43,294 --> 00:47:45,895
God, it's so good.

431
00:47:47,732 --> 00:47:49,398
You do everything good.

432
00:47:49,400 --> 00:47:52,134
How could you fuck up
your marriage?

433
00:47:52,136 --> 00:47:54,570
I never wanted to believe all
that stuff Trevor said about you.

434
00:47:54,572 --> 00:47:55,805
Don't you say his name!

435
00:47:55,807 --> 00:48:00,576
The frigidity, the slovenliness,
the disorder.

436
00:48:00,578 --> 00:48:02,645
That's not you.

437
00:48:04,215 --> 00:48:08,150
It's not the Jennifer I know.

438
00:48:09,053 --> 00:48:11,120
Why are you doing this?

439
00:48:12,857 --> 00:48:14,156
You know why.

440
00:48:14,158 --> 00:48:16,559
I will help you.

441
00:48:16,561 --> 00:48:18,794
It's too late.

442
00:48:20,932 --> 00:48:24,166
Trevor always said you were selfish and
then now I see that all he said was true.

443
00:48:24,168 --> 00:48:25,635
He broke me.

444
00:48:25,637 --> 00:48:27,370
You seem fine to me.

445
00:48:27,372 --> 00:48:29,138
Nothing I ever did was right.

446
00:48:30,308 --> 00:48:32,241
Crawl to me, bitch.

447
00:48:32,243 --> 00:48:33,709
Should got knee pads.

448
00:48:33,711 --> 00:48:36,679
I did, but it wasn't enough.

449
00:48:39,751 --> 00:48:42,652
Try harder.
Try harder.

450
00:48:42,654 --> 00:48:44,687
Try harder.
Try harder.

451
00:48:44,689 --> 00:48:47,623
My skirts were too long.

452
00:48:47,625 --> 00:48:50,693
My necklines were too high.
What?

453
00:48:52,530 --> 00:48:54,030
Try harder.

454
00:48:54,032 --> 00:48:55,431
The underwear.

455
00:48:55,433 --> 00:48:58,167
Come on, come on,
you wouldn't swallow.

456
00:48:58,169 --> 00:49:00,303
Why won't you say that?

457
00:49:00,305 --> 00:49:02,605
You wouldn't even go near it.

458
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,509
You should see you now.

459
00:49:11,616 --> 00:49:14,150
He was rough.

460
00:49:14,152 --> 00:49:18,454
He said I was flabby,
I disgusted him.

461
00:49:20,658 --> 00:49:23,259
Maybe, maybe you could
get him back.

462
00:49:27,131 --> 00:49:29,432
He was cruel.

463
00:49:29,434 --> 00:49:33,936
He was constructive
and motivational.

464
00:49:35,807 --> 00:49:37,540
I mean, you should
take his advice.

465
00:49:37,542 --> 00:49:40,576
Seriously, reinvent yourself,
become the cu...

466
00:49:40,578 --> 00:49:44,146
Slutty cum-guzzler Trevor
always wanted you to be.

467
00:49:44,148 --> 00:49:45,481
It can't be that bad,

468
00:49:45,483 --> 00:49:48,451
you just got to be particular
about what you feed him, right?

469
00:49:48,453 --> 00:49:50,119
Yeah, you could
do your research.

470
00:49:50,121 --> 00:49:51,821
You're good at that, remember?

471
00:49:58,329 --> 00:50:00,262
Really good.

472
00:50:08,806 --> 00:50:11,741
Seriously, you could save
your marriage, Jennifer.

473
00:50:14,679 --> 00:50:16,779
I don't want him back.

474
00:50:22,587 --> 00:50:24,820
So you don't want
a piece of cake?

475
00:50:28,526 --> 00:50:30,559
I want you to let me go.

476
00:50:34,766 --> 00:50:37,166
Well, now we know what it's like

477
00:50:37,168 --> 00:50:40,436
to want something from someone
and not get it.

478
00:50:46,244 --> 00:50:48,377
Frothy and nasty.

479
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:30,086
Help, help me!

480
00:51:30,088 --> 00:51:33,989
Somebody help!
Help. Help me!

481
00:51:33,991 --> 00:51:36,425
Help! Help!

482
00:51:36,427 --> 00:51:38,127
Help!
Stop it.

483
00:51:38,129 --> 00:51:39,562
Stop your screeching.

484
00:51:39,564 --> 00:51:45,134
I've heard it every night for
months and so has everyone else.

485
00:51:45,136 --> 00:51:47,136
That was easy.

486
00:51:48,406 --> 00:51:51,173
Or were you faking it?

487
00:51:53,744 --> 00:51:57,346
You don't have to convince me
of anything, honey.

488
00:51:57,348 --> 00:51:59,915
Okay, where were we, let's see.

489
00:51:59,917 --> 00:52:03,152
Problem areas, problem areas.

490
00:52:06,924 --> 00:52:10,759
Arms up, please.

491
00:52:10,761 --> 00:52:13,395
Up! Please.

492
00:52:29,046 --> 00:52:32,248
Just remember,
everyone can hear you.

493
00:52:32,250 --> 00:52:34,383
And by the way...

494
00:52:34,385 --> 00:52:36,719
no one cares.

495
00:52:57,708 --> 00:52:59,708
Is anybody in here?

496
00:53:01,312 --> 00:53:03,379
Hello, it's Rob.

497
00:53:08,986 --> 00:53:12,454
Look, if you're in there...

498
00:53:13,858 --> 00:53:17,726
I'm just trying to figure out
what went wrong, that's all.

499
00:53:17,728 --> 00:53:22,031
I've been calling... a lot.

500
00:53:22,033 --> 00:53:25,935
And I have your Tupperware,
so...

501
00:53:31,876 --> 00:53:33,275
Shit.

502
00:53:33,277 --> 00:53:37,046
I'm so sorry.
I'm so sorry.

503
00:53:37,048 --> 00:53:40,382
It's okay, it's not,
it's not your fault.

504
00:53:40,384 --> 00:53:43,452
Have you see her at all?

505
00:53:43,454 --> 00:53:44,787
-No.
-No?

506
00:53:44,789 --> 00:53:48,791
No, I think she's at work.

507
00:53:52,129 --> 00:53:53,429
Did you hear that?

508
00:53:53,431 --> 00:53:55,464
Fucking cinch.

509
00:54:02,473 --> 00:54:03,839
What?

510
00:54:04,442 --> 00:54:05,908
What's so funny.

511
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,376
Nothing.

512
00:54:07,378 --> 00:54:09,445
Nothing...

513
00:54:21,559 --> 00:54:22,891
What?

514
00:54:22,893 --> 00:54:24,159
It's just...

515
00:54:24,161 --> 00:54:26,729
What is it you're saying?
-Nothing.

516
00:54:26,731 --> 00:54:29,265
Are you saying I'm...

517
00:54:30,534 --> 00:54:32,735
Are you saying I'm fat?

518
00:54:32,737 --> 00:54:35,404
I'm a fat pig?

519
00:54:35,406 --> 00:54:38,474
Like, I just can't
control myself?

520
00:54:38,476 --> 00:54:41,310
Is that what you're saying?

521
00:54:41,312 --> 00:54:43,545
I'm happy.

522
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:47,483
Happy? Show me happy.
Show me.

523
00:55:13,044 --> 00:55:15,844
Stop crying, stop it, stop.
It's not that bad.

524
00:55:15,846 --> 00:55:17,446
It's not.

525
00:55:17,448 --> 00:55:21,517
Jennifer st...
My God, Jennifer, stop.

526
00:55:21,519 --> 00:55:22,985
Not tonight.
Would you please?

527
00:55:22,987 --> 00:55:25,988
I just wanna watch TV.

528
00:55:25,990 --> 00:55:28,223
Maybe eat my dinner,
and wait for Steven.

529
00:55:33,531 --> 00:55:35,030
Here.

530
00:55:41,105 --> 00:55:42,738
Stop crying.

531
00:55:59,357 --> 00:56:01,557
Another one?
Yes.

532
00:56:21,178 --> 00:56:23,445
-Another?
-Yes.

533
00:56:47,838 --> 00:56:49,405
Really?

534
00:57:02,486 --> 00:57:04,653
Really that is so fucking rude.

535
00:57:04,655 --> 00:57:06,555
What?

536
00:57:06,557 --> 00:57:09,158
I'm sharing with you.
You're not gonna share with me?

537
00:57:09,160 --> 00:57:11,226
That's the way we do it, right?

538
00:57:11,228 --> 00:57:13,328
Right? Isn't that how we do it?
I don't understand.

539
00:57:13,330 --> 00:57:14,730
What?
You don't?

540
00:57:14,732 --> 00:57:17,332
I don't understand?

541
00:57:19,036 --> 00:57:21,136
Of course you don't
fucking understand!

542
00:57:21,138 --> 00:57:25,007
Because you're too fucking selfish!
You're too selfish, Jennifer.

543
00:57:25,009 --> 00:57:28,644
You want them all,
you can fucking have them all!

544
00:57:28,646 --> 00:57:30,546
Fucking have them!

545
00:57:30,548 --> 00:57:33,215
We can't let any of
them go to waste, okay?

546
00:57:33,217 --> 00:57:35,350
None of 'em go to waste.

547
00:57:35,352 --> 00:57:38,487
Eat 'em fucking all right now.

548
00:57:38,489 --> 00:57:41,156
Eat 'em, please.

549
00:57:55,606 --> 00:57:58,307
Going to rehab.

550
00:57:58,309 --> 00:58:00,008
It's the middle
of the night, mother.

551
00:58:07,818 --> 00:58:11,019
I had another dream about you.

552
00:58:11,021 --> 00:58:15,224
And you...

553
00:58:15,226 --> 00:58:19,628
were... perfect!

554
00:58:22,433 --> 00:58:30,138
I know you will do whatever it takes
to get your life back on track.

555
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:38,947
Mommy will call you from rehab.

556
00:58:38,949 --> 00:58:41,717
Okay.

557
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:16,385
Work harder!
Work harder!

558
00:59:29,066 --> 00:59:31,199
I'm so tired.

559
00:59:31,201 --> 00:59:33,769
I said dance.

560
00:59:33,771 --> 00:59:35,237
Dance.

561
00:59:41,211 --> 00:59:43,845
Make it sexy.

562
00:59:43,847 --> 00:59:47,616
Rob told me you are
an excellent dancer.

563
00:59:47,618 --> 00:59:51,520
So show me how you
make the boys go wild.

564
00:59:51,522 --> 00:59:53,155
Dance.

565
01:00:12,943 --> 01:00:15,577
Jill?

566
01:00:15,579 --> 01:00:16,912
Open up the door.

567
01:00:16,914 --> 01:00:18,780
It's, it's Rob.

568
01:00:20,484 --> 01:00:23,518
Open up the door!
God da...

569
01:00:28,325 --> 01:00:30,225
What?

570
01:00:30,227 --> 01:00:31,360
Are you okay?

571
01:00:31,362 --> 01:00:33,962
I'm fantastic, okay?

572
01:00:33,964 --> 01:00:36,231
You, you look...

573
01:00:36,767 --> 01:00:39,067
I've been calling you.

574
01:00:39,069 --> 01:00:41,336
Why haven't you answered?
I've been worried about you.

575
01:00:41,338 --> 01:00:42,537
Would you get your
hand off the chain?

576
01:00:42,539 --> 01:00:44,406
Let me help you.
Let me help you, okay?

577
01:00:44,408 --> 01:00:46,108
Take your hand off the chain.

578
01:00:46,110 --> 01:00:47,709
I understand.
What the fuck?

579
01:01:51,041 --> 01:01:52,607
Rob?

580
01:02:43,360 --> 01:02:45,694
We are back.

581
01:02:45,696 --> 01:02:47,262
It is the final
dessert round,

582
01:02:47,264 --> 01:02:51,867
and one of these chefs will be
preparing their last meal.

583
01:02:51,869 --> 01:02:54,636
Chef Amy, what are you
preparing for us?

584
01:02:54,638 --> 01:02:56,505
Well, I have just put some

585
01:02:56,507 --> 01:02:58,640
delicate almond
lady cakes in the oven.

586
01:02:58,642 --> 01:03:01,810
And I'm going to dress them with
praline lace sponge sugar

587
01:03:01,812 --> 01:03:03,912
and a bit of
fresh whipped cream.

588
01:03:03,914 --> 01:03:05,914
That sounds...

589
01:03:05,916 --> 01:03:08,617
There's been some kind of explosion.
There's so much smoke.

590
01:03:08,619 --> 01:03:13,054
I can't locate chef Amy.
She might be, she might be...

591
01:03:13,056 --> 01:03:14,689
I dominate.

592
01:03:14,691 --> 01:03:16,858
Was that your strategy
all along, Chef Adam,

593
01:03:16,860 --> 01:03:20,162
to kill your opponent before
her desert presentation?

594
01:03:20,164 --> 01:03:22,230
Are you that worried about
Chef Amy's cooking skills?

595
01:04:45,482 --> 01:04:48,483
We knew this challenge
would not go unanswered.

596
01:04:50,587 --> 01:04:53,054
How is she going to compete
with the simplicity

597
01:04:53,056 --> 01:04:55,891
and elegance of her
competitor's presentation?

598
01:05:18,482 --> 01:05:20,982
Love the undergarment.

599
01:05:20,984 --> 01:05:23,718
I think those are from
the ecstasy collection,.

600
01:05:26,657 --> 01:05:29,090
Come on.
Fuck me.

601
01:05:29,092 --> 01:05:31,793
Well, that's an approach.

602
01:05:37,434 --> 01:05:41,603
I thought with the panties,
it would be classier.

603
01:05:41,605 --> 01:05:44,039
Rude and over the top!

604
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:07,896
Looks like she's going
back in the box.

605
01:06:09,866 --> 01:06:12,801
I am liking this.

606
01:06:18,742 --> 01:06:21,042
This is showmanship.

607
01:06:23,747 --> 01:06:26,748
The audience is going wild.

608
01:06:30,887 --> 01:06:33,388
Did she study gymnastics?
What?

609
01:06:33,390 --> 01:06:37,459
She majored in fashion
merchandise at Parsons.

610
01:06:37,461 --> 01:06:40,395
I'll give her points
for creativity.

611
01:06:41,531 --> 01:06:44,199
Who knew the body
could bend like that?

612
01:06:46,803 --> 01:06:51,072
A for effort, but overall
another disappointment.

613
01:06:54,211 --> 01:06:55,977
I wonder what she's getting.

614
01:06:55,979 --> 01:06:58,013
Does she have time
for an extra ingredient?

615
01:06:58,015 --> 01:07:01,883
You know, I don't know, but she needs to
pull this off if she wants to stay alive.

616
01:07:07,691 --> 01:07:09,557
Are those kumquats?

617
01:07:09,559 --> 01:07:11,259
Yes, they are.

618
01:07:11,261 --> 01:07:12,761
You eat those whole,
is that right?

619
01:07:12,763 --> 01:07:17,165
Yes. The flesh, it's quite
sour, but the skin is sweet.

620
01:07:17,167 --> 01:07:24,272
When eaten together they produce
an unusual, but refreshing flavor.

621
01:07:24,274 --> 01:07:25,673
Fascinating.

622
01:07:26,777 --> 01:07:29,144
That is just sad.

623
01:07:29,146 --> 01:07:31,913
Theatrics didn't serve
you well the last time.

624
01:07:31,915 --> 01:07:33,248
Who is throwing fruit?!

625
01:07:33,250 --> 01:07:35,583
Her muscle control
is impressive.

626
01:07:37,387 --> 01:07:39,054
Game on.

627
01:07:40,123 --> 01:07:42,824
This is competition,
ladies and gentleman.

628
01:07:42,826 --> 01:07:44,859
What a battle!

629
01:07:47,330 --> 01:07:50,198
Looks like she's going back
to the Mystery Box.

630
01:07:52,502 --> 01:07:53,735
Handsome.

631
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:57,405
This could be a game changer.

632
01:07:57,407 --> 01:07:59,407
Interesting!

633
01:08:15,225 --> 01:08:17,592
I am not prepared
to evaluate this.

634
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:21,296
You look like shit,
she looks like shit, right?

635
01:08:21,298 --> 01:08:24,099
This is not in my contract.

636
01:08:27,904 --> 01:08:29,170
Crawl bitch!

637
01:08:29,172 --> 01:08:30,772
Are we cutting to commercial?

638
01:08:30,774 --> 01:08:33,541
Fucking crawl bitch!
Come on, crawl!

639
01:08:35,645 --> 01:08:37,679
We're going to have
to consult the rules.

640
01:08:37,681 --> 01:08:40,281
Come on, come to papa.

641
01:08:50,460 --> 01:08:51,860
Bye, Rob.

642
01:08:51,862 --> 01:08:54,696
I hate this dress!

643
01:09:15,685 --> 01:09:17,752
Where'd you go?

644
01:09:18,321 --> 01:09:23,091
Baby... Baby.

645
01:09:24,561 --> 01:09:29,063
Stop crying.

646
01:09:36,907 --> 01:09:38,106
Sorry.

647
01:10:40,637 --> 01:10:45,240
Fucking filthy! You're fucking filthy!
You're so...

648
01:11:10,567 --> 01:11:12,333
Fucking fuck!

649
01:11:12,335 --> 01:11:16,337
You little fucking slut!

650
01:11:16,339 --> 01:11:20,575
You can't even stay out
of my fucking dream.

651
01:11:39,062 --> 01:11:41,796
No! No, Jenny, no!

652
01:11:43,166 --> 01:11:44,732
Jenny?

653
01:11:46,870 --> 01:11:48,369
Jenny.

654
01:12:04,521 --> 01:12:06,087
Jenny!

655
01:12:06,089 --> 01:12:08,856
Hey, did you see Jenny?
She lives right up there.

656
01:12:08,858 --> 01:12:10,058
She's got red hair.

657
01:12:10,060 --> 01:12:13,161
She's... in trouble.

658
01:12:24,541 --> 01:12:27,208
Why won't anybody help me?

659
01:12:45,195 --> 01:12:47,528
Jennifer!

660
01:12:47,530 --> 01:12:49,530
What? What?

661
01:12:49,532 --> 01:12:51,366
You okay?
What happened?

662
01:12:51,368 --> 01:12:55,336
You are not fit for company.
What are you doing out here?

663
01:12:55,338 --> 01:12:57,271
No, no, no.
Miss. Miss.

664
01:12:57,273 --> 01:12:58,906
Hi. What?

665
01:12:58,908 --> 01:13:00,808
Officers, thank you so
much for being here.

666
01:13:00,810 --> 01:13:01,943
That's my roommate.

667
01:13:01,945 --> 01:13:03,845
She is having a really
bad sleep disorder.

668
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:05,246
It's been going on for months.

669
01:13:05,248 --> 01:13:06,981
And honestly,
she's on a cleanse as well.

670
01:13:06,983 --> 01:13:10,151
And that's really messing
up her sleep cycle.

671
01:13:10,153 --> 01:13:12,353
-Just settle down here a minute.
-It's crazy.

672
01:13:12,355 --> 01:13:16,257
Why don't you sit back down there...
catch your breath.

673
01:13:16,259 --> 01:13:17,458
Good idea.

674
01:13:17,460 --> 01:13:18,626
Miss.

675
01:13:18,928 --> 01:13:20,728
What?

676
01:13:20,730 --> 01:13:22,363
Have a seat.

677
01:13:22,365 --> 01:13:24,065
Calm down, please.

678
01:13:27,570 --> 01:13:29,003
Look at me.

679
01:13:30,407 --> 01:13:31,973
Tell me what's wrong.

680
01:13:31,975 --> 01:13:37,445
I told you, it's a nasty Master
Cleanse, and the sleep deprivation.

681
01:13:38,915 --> 01:13:42,450
I mean, you know how it is trying
to lose a few pounds, right?

682
01:13:42,452 --> 01:13:44,318
Not that I know, I mean,
that you know,

683
01:13:44,320 --> 01:13:46,888
cuz you're really fit,
in good shape.

684
01:13:46,890 --> 01:13:52,527
And your costume fits... I mean,
outfit, or uniform, fits really good...

685
01:13:52,529 --> 01:13:55,730
Okay, okay, a cleanse,
and sleep problems.

686
01:13:55,732 --> 01:13:57,932
But that doesn't explain...

687
01:13:59,235 --> 01:14:03,104
One can't just go out in public
half dressed looking like that.

688
01:14:03,106 --> 01:14:05,773
Yes, that's what I'm telling
her, all that time, right?

689
01:14:05,775 --> 01:14:07,241
But she wears...
She hardly wears...

690
01:14:07,243 --> 01:14:10,678
She wears more...
Less than this most of the time.

691
01:14:10,680 --> 01:14:14,081
I guess you'd only get away
with that if you're sexy, right?

692
01:14:14,083 --> 01:14:16,951
Yeah, sex appeal is
not the issue here.

693
01:14:16,953 --> 01:14:18,252
Right.

694
01:14:18,254 --> 01:14:21,289
Cuz you're not the,
the fashion police.

695
01:14:21,291 --> 01:14:23,925
Obviously!

696
01:14:25,628 --> 01:14:27,261
We're here to help you.

697
01:14:27,263 --> 01:14:29,831
Thank you very much for your help,
and I appreciate your service,

698
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,466
all of your service.

699
01:14:35,205 --> 01:14:38,506
I just think she
really needs a nap.

700
01:14:38,508 --> 01:14:41,676
You know? And a little bit of
food, and I can give her that.

701
01:14:41,678 --> 01:14:44,312
So if you could just let us
go now, that would be great.

702
01:14:44,314 --> 01:14:48,883
If you could just let us go, we won't
cause any trouble, or anything.

703
01:14:54,557 --> 01:14:56,457
We're gonna have
to write this up.

704
01:14:56,459 --> 01:14:58,860
Come on, Timmy, there's
something not right here.

705
01:14:58,862 --> 01:14:59,961
What else can we do?

706
01:14:59,963 --> 01:15:01,996
Take her in as a 5150.

707
01:15:01,998 --> 01:15:04,799
You wanna do the
paperwork on that?

708
01:15:04,801 --> 01:15:06,200
Come on, Marie.

709
01:15:06,202 --> 01:15:08,336
My Tammy's about her age.

710
01:15:10,740 --> 01:15:12,740
You know how females are.

711
01:15:12,742 --> 01:15:15,142
Right,
she may be on her period?

712
01:15:15,144 --> 01:15:16,477
-Officer, I...
-Not what I'm saying...

713
01:15:16,479 --> 01:15:19,881
Miss, you need to
stay where you were!

714
01:15:19,883 --> 01:15:23,751
Sorry, you know,
you know, it's just I was...

715
01:15:25,455 --> 01:15:29,056
There's something that I didn't tell you
that I didn't want to say in front of him.

716
01:15:31,594 --> 01:15:33,394
I didn't tell you all the truth.

717
01:15:33,395 --> 01:15:35,195
I know I'm supposed to tell the whole
truth and nothing but the truth,

718
01:15:35,198 --> 01:15:38,199
but I left something out.
Cuz you see, there was this boy.

719
01:15:38,201 --> 01:15:42,503
Okay. It's your call, but if
anything goes wrong, it's on you.

720
01:15:47,110 --> 01:15:51,479
Miss, we're gonna, take you back to
your home here in the patrol car, okay?

721
01:15:51,481 --> 01:15:53,080
Home? Home.

722
01:15:53,082 --> 01:15:54,682
Yes.

723
01:15:54,684 --> 01:15:57,084
It's okay. Come on.
Okay.

724
01:15:57,887 --> 01:15:59,554
Thank you so much, Officer.

725
01:15:59,556 --> 01:16:00,821
You're welcome

726
01:16:08,765 --> 01:16:11,365
Jenn, just relax okay,

727
01:16:11,367 --> 01:16:13,935
and lean back
so I can get your front.

728
01:16:19,842 --> 01:16:21,409
We need to talk.

729
01:16:22,145 --> 01:16:23,678
Talk.

730
01:16:28,685 --> 01:16:30,351
You always had
such great nipples,

731
01:16:30,353 --> 01:16:33,688
I never understand
why Trevor didn't...

732
01:16:39,262 --> 01:16:42,129
Fuck, you scared the
shit out of me today.

733
01:16:54,143 --> 01:16:56,644
I don't really wanna
have to do any of this,

734
01:16:56,646 --> 01:17:01,816
but you give me no other choice.

735
01:17:18,835 --> 01:17:21,736
I thought you wanted
to get rid of me.

736
01:17:23,973 --> 01:17:25,506
Of course not, no.

737
01:17:25,508 --> 01:17:27,174
I never wanted that, Jennifer.

738
01:17:27,176 --> 01:17:30,411
You are all I have. I don't
know what I would do if you...

739
01:17:44,927 --> 01:17:46,661
Come on.

740
01:17:49,499 --> 01:17:51,766
What?

741
01:17:51,768 --> 01:17:53,034
It's cold.

742
01:17:54,237 --> 01:17:55,703
It's warm.

743
01:17:55,705 --> 01:17:58,906
Jennifer, no, look, hey,
look it's steaming.

744
01:17:58,908 --> 01:18:02,376
Look, look.
Take your hand. See?

745
01:18:04,180 --> 01:18:05,980
It's warm.

746
01:18:05,982 --> 01:18:08,916
Look, you see?
It's warm.

747
01:18:13,856 --> 01:18:16,424
It's been so hard.

748
01:18:22,799 --> 01:18:25,132
I've been trying my best.

749
01:18:26,102 --> 01:18:29,537
After everything with Trevor,

750
01:18:29,539 --> 01:18:34,041
I've just been trying
to get myself back.

751
01:18:34,043 --> 01:18:37,278
-I know.
-So many expectations.

752
01:18:38,247 --> 01:18:41,015
I just want to be free.
Yeah.

753
01:18:45,922 --> 01:18:47,688
Jilly?

754
01:18:48,291 --> 01:18:49,356
Yeah?

755
01:18:49,358 --> 01:18:54,228
You absolutely must take your cooking
and share it with the world.

756
01:18:57,633 --> 01:19:00,167
Those are just experiments.

757
01:19:00,169 --> 01:19:03,804
But look at your resolve.

758
01:19:03,806 --> 01:19:06,173
You can do it,
I know you want to.

759
01:19:06,175 --> 01:19:08,342
I can even help.

760
01:19:12,014 --> 01:19:14,815
-Help?
-Of course.

761
01:19:14,817 --> 01:19:18,252
With our combined powers
we'll be unstoppable.

762
01:19:20,523 --> 01:19:22,189
I'm glad we're talking.

763
01:19:22,191 --> 01:19:24,425
Yeah.

764
01:19:28,030 --> 01:19:30,464
Help! Somebody!

765
01:19:31,768 --> 01:19:33,868
Fucking do it!

766
01:19:33,870 --> 01:19:35,202
Are you kidding me?

767
01:19:41,644 --> 01:19:43,410
You need to look in the mirror.

768
01:19:43,412 --> 01:19:45,179
Crazy bitch.

769
01:19:45,181 --> 01:19:47,715
You have no right to judge me.

770
01:20:12,074 --> 01:20:13,641
You know I'll fucking
do it, right?

771
01:20:13,643 --> 01:20:17,011
I'll fucking do it right now!

772
01:20:17,013 --> 01:20:21,482
There's no turning back, bitch.

773
01:20:41,671 --> 01:20:45,105
You're not gonna fool me again.

774
01:21:09,866 --> 01:21:11,599
Sorry.

775
01:21:13,636 --> 01:21:15,369
Don't...

776
01:22:42,625 --> 01:22:45,893
It's a cinch.

777
01:22:56,605 --> 01:22:59,606
What the fuck?

778
01:24:11,347 --> 01:24:13,680
Enough is enough!

779
01:24:19,155 --> 01:24:21,355
Happy birthday!

780
01:24:22,491 --> 01:24:23,490
What?

781
01:24:24,393 --> 01:24:26,627
I didn't mean to be
a Facebook stalker,

782
01:24:26,629 --> 01:24:30,731
but I couldn't help
but see before

783
01:24:30,733 --> 01:24:33,233
that your birthday
was coming up.

784
01:24:34,503 --> 01:24:39,239
Well, I just wanted to apologize
for being so pushy.

785
01:24:39,241 --> 01:24:43,977
I mean, sometimes my anal
retentiveness gets the best of me.

786
01:24:43,979 --> 01:24:46,146
Thanks for friending me.

787
01:24:49,785 --> 01:24:51,885
That's your way of apologizing?

788
01:24:53,756 --> 01:24:55,255
You know what?

789
01:24:55,257 --> 01:25:00,661
Everything Jennifer says
about you... is true.

790
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,429
I don't understand.

791
01:25:02,431 --> 01:25:07,668
I just wanted to
do something ni...

792
01:25:22,218 --> 01:25:24,651
I am on to you.

793
01:25:40,970 --> 01:25:43,904
It needs more salt.

794
01:25:54,150 --> 01:25:55,983
Samantha Foxy?

795
01:25:55,985 --> 01:25:57,518
I know.

796
01:25:59,989 --> 01:26:02,623
-It's Rob.
-Let it go to voice-mail.

797
01:26:08,097 --> 01:26:12,332
Look...
Look how fat she looks there.

798
01:26:13,736 --> 01:26:17,104
She's trying to do
little arms back look.

799
01:26:17,106 --> 01:26:18,205
I know.

800
01:26:18,207 --> 01:26:20,474
Wait.

801
01:26:21,443 --> 01:26:23,644
My God.
Why would she wear that color?

802
01:26:23,646 --> 01:26:24,711
I don't know.

803
01:26:24,713 --> 01:26:26,580
Fucking looks like a bag.

804
01:26:28,117 --> 01:26:29,750
Put a bag over her head.

805
01:26:29,752 --> 01:26:31,084
Old basket of rolls.

806
01:26:33,822 --> 01:26:36,123
She seriously looks
like a basket of rolls.

807
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:39,993
Like really lumpy ones
that are two days old.

808
01:26:42,364 --> 01:26:44,131
Baguettes.

809
01:26:48,170 --> 01:26:50,537
Holla! Holla!

810
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:51,638
Holla!

811
01:26:51,640 --> 01:26:53,907
She's a holla back girl.

812
01:27:00,382 --> 01:27:02,282
Listen, listen.

813
01:27:03,118 --> 01:27:05,986
Hey, it's Rob.
This is hard.

814
01:27:05,988 --> 01:27:09,089
I really thought we had a
connection, but I can't...

815
01:27:09,091 --> 01:27:11,992
I can't even... I don't even
know what to call it.

816
01:27:11,994 --> 01:27:15,596
But I just can't do this anymore.
I mean us, and I can't...

817
01:27:15,598 --> 01:27:19,933
Why won't you let me help you?
What the fuck is wrong with you?

818
01:27:19,935 --> 01:27:22,636
God, I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to lose my temper.

819
01:27:22,638 --> 01:27:25,505
It's just, I wish you...

820
01:27:25,507 --> 01:27:27,741
Look, I understand
what you're going though,

821
01:27:27,743 --> 01:27:29,176
and I wish I could be better.

822
01:27:29,178 --> 01:27:31,111
But I have to...

823
01:27:31,113 --> 01:27:35,482
For the sake of my own sobriety,
I just, I can't see you anymore.

824
01:27:35,484 --> 01:27:37,417
My fucking God.

825
01:27:40,289 --> 01:27:42,656
"For the sake
of my own sobriety."

826
01:27:42,658 --> 01:27:44,224
Pussy.

827
01:27:44,226 --> 01:27:45,792
Totes is a loser.

828
01:27:45,794 --> 01:27:48,195
Serio.
Let the ruiner have him.

829
01:27:49,898 --> 01:27:51,198
Lame.

830
01:27:51,200 --> 01:27:54,835
We don't need him.
No... Wait.

831
01:27:57,072 --> 01:28:00,240
What do you mean "we"?

832
01:28:04,113 --> 01:28:10,083
Cuz you know...
you never had him.

833
01:28:14,990 --> 01:28:16,890
Wait.

834
01:28:18,594 --> 01:28:20,794
Yes, you did.

835
01:28:20,796 --> 01:28:22,863
You did!
It's not, it's not Cathy.

836
01:28:22,865 --> 01:28:24,264
It's you, isn't it?

837
01:28:24,266 --> 01:28:25,666
Fuck.

838
01:28:25,668 --> 01:28:27,367
Fuck. Fuck.

839
01:28:27,369 --> 01:28:30,270
Why do you fuck everything up?

840
01:28:30,272 --> 01:28:32,406
Why do you do that?

841
01:28:35,010 --> 01:28:36,476
Fuck you!

842
01:28:36,478 --> 01:28:39,813
You think that
you're just not gonna...

843
01:28:39,815 --> 01:28:42,316
You're just not gonna
have any consequences?

844
01:28:42,318 --> 01:28:44,351
That you're just gonna be
able to get away with it?

845
01:28:44,353 --> 01:28:46,753
What the fuck!

846
01:28:48,324 --> 01:28:50,757
You know what?
You know what?

847
01:28:50,759 --> 01:28:52,526
You're gonna be punished.

848
01:28:52,528 --> 01:28:54,861
Yeah, you're going to be
fucking punished.

849
01:28:54,863 --> 01:28:59,333
You don't have any food.
None today and...

850
01:28:59,335 --> 01:29:02,669
you're not going to have
any food tomorrow, either.

851
01:29:06,675 --> 01:29:09,343
You fucking bitch!

852
01:29:11,980 --> 01:29:17,017
God, why am I even your friend?

853
01:29:17,019 --> 01:29:20,187
Why?
Would you tell me that?

854
01:29:31,533 --> 01:29:38,772
You... are...
the ruiner... of everything.

855
01:29:55,257 --> 01:29:58,225
Me and Rob...

856
01:29:58,227 --> 01:30:00,427
and everything.

857
01:31:20,375 --> 01:31:22,676
What are you still doing here?

858
01:31:26,615 --> 01:31:28,548
Jennifer, wake up!

859
01:31:28,550 --> 01:31:31,852
Wake up, it's dinner time.

860
01:31:31,854 --> 01:31:33,553
Wake up.

861
01:31:39,027 --> 01:31:41,962
You will cheat...

862
01:31:41,964 --> 01:31:45,131
Will... submissive...

863
01:31:46,969 --> 01:31:50,437
Eyes open.
Eyes open.

864
01:31:50,439 --> 01:31:53,473
Eyes closed.

865
01:31:55,511 --> 01:31:57,777
Weak, stupid...

866
01:31:57,779 --> 01:32:00,580
Stupid... cunt...

867
01:32:00,582 --> 01:32:03,984
No one ever...
No one will ever want you.

868
01:32:03,986 --> 01:32:05,519
You don't deserve it.

869
01:32:05,521 --> 01:32:13,026
Stupid, ugly, useless, waste...

870
01:32:13,028 --> 01:32:15,662
Why are you still alive!?

871
01:32:15,664 --> 01:32:17,497
I hate you.

872
01:32:18,433 --> 01:32:21,434
I hate you, I hate you.

873
01:32:25,541 --> 01:32:28,942
I'm winning,
I can smell your weakness.

874
01:32:30,212 --> 01:32:35,882
Flabby, puss filled...

875
01:32:35,884 --> 01:32:38,385
I'm not going anywhere.

876
01:36:22,744 --> 01:36:24,244
Arms.

877
01:36:33,588 --> 01:36:35,088
Suck that in.

878
01:36:46,668 --> 01:36:50,203
This is... Fashion Week.

879
01:36:53,275 --> 01:36:55,308
She's back.

880
01:36:55,310 --> 01:36:56,543
Really?

881
01:36:56,545 --> 01:36:58,678
I just saw her.

882
01:36:59,347 --> 01:37:01,047
Tell her to come to my office.

883
01:37:06,288 --> 01:37:08,254
Were you held hostage?

884
01:37:11,193 --> 01:37:13,726
Points for showing
up on the big week.

885
01:37:13,728 --> 01:37:16,062
The outfit is an improvement...

886
01:37:16,998 --> 01:37:19,666
but no matter what
this town tells you,

887
01:37:19,668 --> 01:37:21,901
flakiness is not fashionable.

888
01:37:27,809 --> 01:37:29,542
You're fired.

889
01:37:34,716 --> 01:37:37,116
Eat a sandwich.

890
01:37:42,924 --> 01:37:44,290
Don't worry, Mina.

891
01:37:44,292 --> 01:37:47,660
These chemicals don't
make you crave carbs.

892
01:37:47,662 --> 01:37:50,063
Get up, we need to talk.

893
01:37:50,065 --> 01:37:51,264
Come on, come on.

894
01:37:51,266 --> 01:37:53,900

I've made a great meal.

899
01:39:14,883 --> 01:39:17,150
Everything is perfect.

01:39:19,321 --> 01:39:22,689
I am perfect.
