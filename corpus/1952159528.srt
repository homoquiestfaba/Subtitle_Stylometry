01:11:57,413 --> 01:11:59,404
Excuse me, poozer.

702
01:12:07,656 --> 01:12:08,918
Jordan, can you hear me?.

703
01:12:09,091 --> 01:12:10,183
Come in, Jordan.

704
01:12:11,293 --> 01:12:13,158
Where are you?.

705
01:12:13,763 --> 01:12:16,163
Falling. I forgot my chute.

706
01:12:37,720 --> 01:12:38,948
Very creative.

707
01:12:39,121 --> 01:12:40,782
Hey, I got a few tricks too.

708
01:12:49,064 --> 01:12:51,692
APPA ALl APSA: Though we continue
to mourn those who have fallen...

709
01:12:51,867 --> 01:12:54,859
...during the tragic betrayal
of recent days...

710
01:12:55,037 --> 01:12:58,939
...we also celebrate our resiliency.

711
01:12:59,108 --> 01:13:02,976
Our battery is repaired,
our rings replenished...

712
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:06,410
...and our battle
against the dark forces continues.

713
01:13:06,582 --> 01:13:09,813
If we have learned anything
from our last battle...

714
01:13:09,985 --> 01:13:14,922
...it is that great evil can arise
from the most unexpected sources...

715
01:13:15,090 --> 01:13:19,720
...but, most thankfully,
so can great heroism.

716
01:13:21,230 --> 01:13:24,427
I've asked Ganthet
to lead us in our pledge.

717
01:13:24,600 --> 01:13:26,830
If you don't mind, Appa Ali Apsa...

718
01:13:27,002 --> 01:13:31,234
...I'd like to give that privilege
to our newest Lantern, Hal Jordan.

719
01:13:33,175 --> 01:13:34,938
Hear, hear.

720
01:13:36,212 --> 01:13:37,509
What's the matter?.

721
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,012
I just learned the thing this morning.

722
01:13:45,054 --> 01:13:46,851
HAL:
In brightest day--

723
01:13:47,022 --> 01:13:52,187
ALL: In blackest night,
no evil shall escape my sight.

724
01:13:52,361 --> 01:13:55,296
Let those who worship evil's might...

725
01:13:55,464 --> 01:14:00,299
...beware my power,
Green Lantern's light!

726
01:14:07,443 --> 01:14:08,467
I'm off.

727
01:14:08,644 --> 01:14:09,975
Where are you going?.

728
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,636
I've gotta go punch a clock
with my other boss.

729
01:14:13,349 --> 01:14:16,045
I can see where this is gonna be
a long commute.

730
01:17:28,944 --> 01:17:30,935
