1
00:02:17,603 --> 00:02:19,271
What's the matter?

2
00:02:20,506 --> 00:02:22,140
What's the matter?

3
00:02:23,408 --> 00:02:25,043
Bulb must be out.

4
00:02:34,954 --> 00:02:37,188
-Do you have me?
-Always.

5
00:02:39,792 --> 00:02:43,061
-Can you see anything?
-Yes. Remember the stairs?

6
00:02:43,461 --> 00:02:46,531
No. I don't remember
anything about this house,

7
00:02:46,799 --> 00:02:48,768
except that I don't like it.

8
00:02:49,301 --> 00:02:51,503
What are you talking about?
This is a great place.

9
00:02:51,637 --> 00:02:54,271
No, it's cold,
and it's so dark.

10
00:02:54,272 --> 00:02:55,840
You'll light it up, princess.

11
00:02:57,242 --> 00:03:00,112
-Yeah, right, especially now.
-Don't say that.

12
00:03:01,780 --> 00:03:03,715
Look, I'm bearing
the burden here.

13
00:03:03,716 --> 00:03:05,349
All right?

14
00:03:05,350 --> 00:03:06,517
This is all my fault.

15
00:03:06,518 --> 00:03:08,186
Everything's my fault.

16
00:03:08,419 --> 00:03:11,422
I just wanna disappear.

17
00:03:11,924 --> 00:03:13,890
I can't leave
everything I've built.

18
00:03:13,891 --> 00:03:15,460
We'll stay here.

19
00:03:15,461 --> 00:03:16,793
We'll figure it out.

20
00:03:16,794 --> 00:03:18,830
Come on.

21
00:03:34,379 --> 00:03:35,812
Get ready for bed.

22
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:37,482
You'll feel better.

23
00:03:38,349 --> 00:03:39,883
I doubt that.

24
00:03:39,884 --> 00:03:42,154
Helen,
what you have is temporary.

25
00:03:44,355 --> 00:03:47,025
-You keep saying that.
-Everything will pass.

26
00:03:47,026 --> 00:03:48,425
The feelings will pass too.

27
00:03:48,426 --> 00:03:49,693
I know they will.

28
00:03:49,694 --> 00:03:50,829
You'll wake up day,

29
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,464
and the past will become
more distant until one day...

30
00:03:53,465 --> 00:03:54,899
I'll never
forget what happened.

31
00:03:54,900 --> 00:03:56,967
-You will.
-I won't.

32
00:03:56,968 --> 00:04:00,005
Some day, you'll see.

33
00:04:01,340 --> 00:04:03,074
You'll realize that
it wasn't your fault.

34
00:04:08,881 --> 00:04:10,515
Take these.

35
00:04:10,649 --> 00:04:12,283
Help you sleep.

36
00:05:00,307 --> 00:05:06,735
<b>DEN OF DARKNESS</b>

37
00:05:07,816 --> 00:05:11,416
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

38
00:06:07,499 --> 00:06:09,568
Princess...

39
00:06:09,999 --> 00:06:11,369
I'm leaving.

40
00:06:11,803 --> 00:06:15,071
-I have to go to work.
-Where are you going?

41
00:06:15,072 --> 00:06:16,773
I won't be late.

42
00:06:16,774 --> 00:06:18,842
No. No, I can't be alone.

43
00:06:18,843 --> 00:06:20,677
You won't be alone.
Rosa will be here.

44
00:06:20,678 --> 00:06:23,213
-No. Who?
-My old housekeeper.

45
00:06:23,214 --> 00:06:24,915
I called her.

46
00:06:24,916 --> 00:06:26,650
She'll stay with you,
take care of things.

47
00:06:26,651 --> 00:06:28,220
No. I want you.
I want you.

48
00:06:29,788 --> 00:06:32,390
-Don't go.
-Rosa will be here.

49
00:06:32,690 --> 00:06:34,158
Anything you need.

50
00:07:06,190 --> 00:07:08,192
Hey, stranger.

51
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,233
Morning, Leela.

52
00:07:14,899 --> 00:07:17,402
-When did you get in?
-Last night.

53
00:07:19,271 --> 00:07:21,873
Are you staying
or just checking the place?

54
00:07:21,874 --> 00:07:24,443
Probably be here for a while.

55
00:07:24,942 --> 00:07:26,277
Good.

56
00:07:26,278 --> 00:07:29,181
Why don't you stop in later?

57
00:07:31,850 --> 00:07:33,485
I gotta get to work.

58
00:07:34,653 --> 00:07:36,321
'Kay.

59
00:07:36,922 --> 00:07:40,159
Bye.

60
00:08:04,615 --> 00:08:06,484
Buenos dias, señora.

61
00:08:09,086 --> 00:08:12,790
-Have you seen my scarf?
-I'll find it, señora.

62
00:08:15,127 --> 00:08:17,196
So, have you ever taken care
of anyone like me before?

63
00:08:17,829 --> 00:08:19,963
I mean, this is temporary

64
00:08:19,964 --> 00:08:21,299
but...

65
00:08:21,300 --> 00:08:23,099
I take care of lots
of people, señora.

66
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,869
I clean.
I cook.

67
00:08:25,937 --> 00:08:27,605
Great.

68
00:08:28,673 --> 00:08:32,577
Señora, Mila, my cousin,
he got runned over by a tractor.

69
00:08:33,110 --> 00:08:36,148
Both the legs
caught off, no good.

70
00:08:36,315 --> 00:08:38,217
And I take care of him.

71
00:08:39,183 --> 00:08:41,220
Wonderful.

72
00:08:41,687 --> 00:08:43,354
He's good now, señora.

73
00:08:43,754 --> 00:08:45,324
Mila, he find better work

74
00:08:45,890 --> 00:08:48,426
with no legs
than when he was complete.

75
00:08:49,327 --> 00:08:51,662
He find a job in computadoras

76
00:08:51,663 --> 00:08:53,163
in big company.

77
00:08:53,164 --> 00:08:54,731
No problem.

78
00:08:54,732 --> 00:08:56,367
No problem, señora.

79
00:08:59,270 --> 00:09:00,771
I get it.
It's okay.

80
00:09:00,772 --> 00:09:02,672
It's okay.
Señora, it's okay.

81
00:09:02,673 --> 00:09:04,108
I clean it.
I clean it, señora.

82
00:09:04,109 --> 00:09:05,878
I clean it.
It's not broken.

83
00:09:07,044 --> 00:09:09,148
It's no broken, señora.

84
00:09:09,648 --> 00:09:11,583
Señora, it's okay.

85
00:09:12,317 --> 00:09:14,152
It's okay, señora.

86
00:09:14,251 --> 00:09:16,187
You'll be okay, señora.

87
00:09:17,923 --> 00:09:19,725
It's okay, señora.

88
00:09:21,058 --> 00:09:22,927
Breathe.

89
00:09:27,932 --> 00:09:29,567
And again.

90
00:09:34,038 --> 00:09:35,874
And one more time.

91
00:09:40,278 --> 00:09:41,778
Her vitals are fine, Arthur.

92
00:09:41,779 --> 00:09:43,214
Psychosomatic?

93
00:09:43,215 --> 00:09:44,816
Well, the symptoms are real

94
00:09:48,854 --> 00:09:51,623
but she is responding
to some stimulation,

95
00:09:51,990 --> 00:09:53,657
which is a good sign.

96
00:09:53,658 --> 00:09:54,959
She told me
she could see some shapes

97
00:09:54,960 --> 00:09:56,728
on occasion, some light.

98
00:09:57,095 --> 00:09:59,162
But nothing clear.
I'm sitting right here.

99
00:09:59,163 --> 00:10:00,632
Of course, darling.

100
00:10:01,133 --> 00:10:03,099
You're acting
like I'm not sitting here.

101
00:10:03,100 --> 00:10:05,069
I'm just trying
to explain the situation.

102
00:10:05,070 --> 00:10:07,404
Derrell was kind enough to come
over, given the circumstances.

103
00:10:07,405 --> 00:10:09,507
But I can answer
my own questions.

104
00:10:09,707 --> 00:10:11,576
Then please tell him.

105
00:10:12,443 --> 00:10:15,845
Things are dark
and hazy and unfocused.

106
00:10:15,846 --> 00:10:17,982
I don't know.
It fluctuates.

107
00:10:18,417 --> 00:10:20,518
The prognosis isn't clear.

108
00:10:20,751 --> 00:10:23,186
You may see again,
and you may not.

109
00:10:23,187 --> 00:10:24,888
It's hard to say.

110
00:10:24,889 --> 00:10:27,457
I can't see a goddamn thing.
All right?

111
00:10:27,458 --> 00:10:30,628
Won't you just tell me
what this thing is, please?

112
00:10:30,928 --> 00:10:32,763
Helen, you are...

113
00:10:32,998 --> 00:10:36,768
Although clinically your vision
is considered low,

114
00:10:36,868 --> 00:10:39,235
your exam results
are inconclusive.

115
00:10:39,236 --> 00:10:41,238
Right now, with your vision
acuity as it is,

116
00:10:41,239 --> 00:10:44,276
you're considered legally blind.

117
00:10:45,210 --> 00:10:47,077
Now, I understand that
it's hard to live with,

118
00:10:47,078 --> 00:10:48,479
but you just need to accept it
and move on.

119
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,314
It's not the end of the world.

120
00:10:50,315 --> 00:10:52,950
There are some great programs
for the visually impaired.

121
00:10:53,951 --> 00:10:55,920
-Rosa!
-Helen, calm down.

122
00:10:55,921 --> 00:10:58,221
Do not... You told me
this thing was gonna pass,

123
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:00,257
and now you're saying
that it's gonna last forever?

124
00:11:00,258 --> 00:11:02,158
-What happened?
-Princess, you...

125
00:11:02,159 --> 00:11:03,460
Don't princess me.

126
00:11:03,461 --> 00:11:05,330
Get me out of here, Rosa.

127
00:11:07,298 --> 00:11:09,867
-Si, señora.
-I didn't mean to be harsh,

128
00:11:09,868 --> 00:11:11,201
but right now you'll just
have to live

129
00:11:11,202 --> 00:11:13,137
as though you'll never
see again.

130
00:11:13,138 --> 00:11:14,806
Shut up, okay?

131
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:16,239
Do you hear me?

132
00:11:16,240 --> 00:11:18,175
All of you doctors are the same.

133
00:11:18,176 --> 00:11:19,810
You say you know everything.

134
00:11:19,811 --> 00:11:21,446
But when it counts,
you know nothing.

135
00:11:25,750 --> 00:11:31,023
There's a step
in front of you.

136
00:11:34,024 --> 00:11:35,594
Good.
I'm sorry, Derrell.

137
00:11:35,860 --> 00:11:37,894
Sometimes she just
acts like a child.

138
00:11:37,895 --> 00:11:38,896
It's to be expected.

139
00:11:38,897 --> 00:11:40,499
She's had a hard time of it.

140
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,000
We only do what we know.

141
00:11:43,001 --> 00:11:44,970
Listen, call me
if you need anything, Arthur.

142
00:12:07,392 --> 00:12:08,492
It's okay, señora.

143
00:12:08,493 --> 00:12:09,994
It's okay.

144
00:12:09,995 --> 00:12:11,629
You're gonna be okay, señora.

145
00:12:12,397 --> 00:12:14,066
It's okay.

146
00:12:45,330 --> 00:12:47,532
Come on! Come on!

147
00:12:49,433 --> 00:12:51,135
Hold on.
I'm right there.

148
00:12:53,938 --> 00:12:55,506
Okay.

149
00:14:18,188 --> 00:14:20,057
No!

150
00:14:20,325 --> 00:14:21,325
It's okay, señora.

151
00:14:21,326 --> 00:14:23,159
Portfolio favor, señora.

152
00:14:23,160 --> 00:14:24,494
Please don't move.
Don't move, señora, por favor.

153
00:14:24,495 --> 00:14:26,964
-I'm blind! I'm fucking blind.
-It's okay, senora.

154
00:14:26,965 --> 00:14:27,831
I help you.
No!

155
00:14:27,832 --> 00:14:29,233
I help you, señora,
put some more.

156
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:30,466
I'm worthless.

157
00:14:30,467 --> 00:14:32,603
I can't even do my makeup.

158
00:14:32,604 --> 00:14:35,205
No. No, I call a doctor.
I call a doctor.

159
00:14:35,206 --> 00:14:38,176
What can they do?
What... what can he do?

160
00:14:40,044 --> 00:14:41,846
Señora.
It's okay.

161
00:14:42,147 --> 00:14:44,015
It's okay.

162
00:14:44,581 --> 00:14:46,250
I don't know what to do.

163
00:14:48,653 --> 00:14:52,189
-I'm being punished.
-I messed up really bad.

164
00:14:52,190 --> 00:14:54,860
I really was stupid.

165
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,229
I was.

166
00:14:57,495 --> 00:14:59,363
Well, I wouldn't be
too worried about it.

167
00:14:59,364 --> 00:15:00,965
I'll come back any minute.

168
00:15:00,966 --> 00:15:03,300
So, look, if you'd
change for me, okay?

169
00:15:03,301 --> 00:15:04,803
-All right.
-Thanks.

170
00:15:10,375 --> 00:15:12,042
Yes?

171
00:15:13,144 --> 00:15:14,577
All right.

172
00:15:14,578 --> 00:15:16,580
No, it's okay.

173
00:15:19,717 --> 00:15:22,186
I will be home
as soon as I can.

174
00:15:28,259 --> 00:15:30,595
Okay. Let's see
what we have here.

175
00:15:40,471 --> 00:15:42,106
There she is.

176
00:15:49,214 --> 00:15:51,080
I'm blind, Arthur.
Is this some kind of joke?

177
00:15:51,081 --> 00:15:52,682
Come on.

178
00:15:52,683 --> 00:15:55,753
We'll have a nice dinner, relax.

179
00:15:57,522 --> 00:15:59,157
Nothing's changed for me, Helen.

180
00:15:59,490 --> 00:16:01,292
You're still
my beautiful wife, you know?

181
00:16:03,293 --> 00:16:04,763
Can I tell you how you look?

182
00:16:08,700 --> 00:16:11,002
You have gorgeous shoulders,

183
00:16:13,370 --> 00:16:17,575
a long graceful neck

184
00:16:18,342 --> 00:16:19,977
like a swan.

185
00:16:23,380 --> 00:16:25,049
Will you put one in my hair?

186
00:16:57,615 --> 00:16:59,283
You win.

187
00:16:59,583 --> 00:17:00,683
I'll get ready.

188
00:17:00,684 --> 00:17:02,319
Can't wait.

189
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,594
-Honey, did you see my scarf?
-No.

190
00:17:10,595 --> 00:17:12,630
Last I saw it,
it was on the end

191
00:17:21,573 --> 00:17:23,208
table.

192
00:18:08,853 --> 00:18:10,888
Arthur?

193
00:18:13,825 --> 00:18:15,460
Is that you?

194
00:18:18,296 --> 00:18:20,165
Arthur?

195
00:18:21,231 --> 00:18:22,231
Is that you?

196
00:18:22,232 --> 00:18:23,935
Not quite ready!

197
00:18:29,339 --> 00:18:31,042
I think
there's something up here!

198
00:18:38,516 --> 00:18:40,284
Don't come down.

199
00:18:40,285 --> 00:18:41,753
I'm almost finished.

200
00:18:43,421 --> 00:18:45,490
Damn it, Arthur!
There's something up here!

201
00:18:46,223 --> 00:18:47,991
One more minute.

202
00:18:57,669 --> 00:18:59,503
What are you doing?

203
00:19:00,105 --> 00:19:02,739
There's something in the
wall. I just heard something.

204
00:19:02,740 --> 00:19:04,809
What are you talking about?

205
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,480
-I just heard something in...
-I didn't hear anything.

206
00:19:08,613 --> 00:19:11,282
-I could've sworn I did.
-It's probably the wind.

207
00:19:11,749 --> 00:19:14,085
Come on. I made us a feast.

208
00:19:17,588 --> 00:19:19,256
You look wonderful.

209
00:19:19,990 --> 00:19:24,094
-I did my best.
-You're perfect.

210
00:19:24,328 --> 00:19:25,996
Come on.

211
00:19:57,394 --> 00:19:59,030
It's your favorite.

212
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:07,205
Have as much
as you want, princess.

213
00:20:07,404 --> 00:20:09,040
There's plenty.

214
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,161
You're just so beautiful, honey.

215
00:20:31,461 --> 00:20:33,363
Here's something else,

216
00:20:35,599 --> 00:20:37,901
something you want.

217
00:20:43,607 --> 00:20:46,109
-What is this?
-A little something.

218
00:20:46,911 --> 00:20:48,580
What is it?

219
00:20:55,452 --> 00:20:58,121
It's an outfit for bed.

220
00:21:03,027 --> 00:21:04,928
Is this for me or for you?

221
00:21:05,529 --> 00:21:07,264
It's from
your favorite store.

222
00:21:11,669 --> 00:21:13,304
What does it look like?

223
00:21:13,503 --> 00:21:17,441
It's pink and...

224
00:21:18,776 --> 00:21:21,613
-It's silky?
-It's very nice.

225
00:21:22,579 --> 00:21:24,215
Try it on.

226
00:21:25,650 --> 00:21:27,285
Okay.

227
00:21:50,441 --> 00:21:52,143
Still too soon?

228
00:22:01,652 --> 00:22:03,085
I just need a little bit
more time.

229
00:22:03,086 --> 00:22:05,156
I know.

230
00:22:07,491 --> 00:22:10,160
-I love you.
-Me too.

231
00:24:05,942 --> 00:24:09,446
-Is Athur here?
-Un momento, por favor.

232
00:24:10,280 --> 00:24:13,048
Señora, it's a señora here,

233
00:24:13,049 --> 00:24:14,685
a visitor.

234
00:24:15,553 --> 00:24:17,655
It's just me, my dear.

235
00:24:20,057 --> 00:24:24,328
Well, I was not expecting
to see this.

236
00:24:24,595 --> 00:24:26,595
-What?
-I came to see Arthur.

237
00:24:26,596 --> 00:24:28,097
Who are you?

238
00:24:28,098 --> 00:24:30,666
-Excuse me.
-I am Leela.

239
00:24:30,667 --> 00:24:31,934
I live next door.

240
00:24:31,935 --> 00:24:34,304
Didn't Arthur tell you about me?

241
00:24:34,538 --> 00:24:36,139
No.

242
00:24:36,140 --> 00:24:38,443
And apparently he didn't
tell you about me either.

243
00:24:38,709 --> 00:24:41,178
Must have forgotten
we were married.

244
00:24:41,578 --> 00:24:43,214
I'm Helen.

245
00:24:44,781 --> 00:24:48,552
Well,
you know how men are.

246
00:24:48,553 --> 00:24:51,422
They're all pigs when it comes
to thinks like that.

247
00:24:51,588 --> 00:24:54,825
You know, that's why us women
have to stick together.

248
00:24:56,227 --> 00:24:58,096
Sure.

249
00:24:58,296 --> 00:24:59,662
You seem upset, darling.

250
00:24:59,663 --> 00:25:01,331
How's your day going?

251
00:25:03,901 --> 00:25:05,770
My day?

252
00:25:06,269 --> 00:25:08,272
Well, besides being blind

253
00:25:08,673 --> 00:25:13,176
and tripping
over everything, really good.

254
00:25:19,215 --> 00:25:20,749
I don't know.

255
00:25:20,750 --> 00:25:23,186
I just wanna know
if I'm ever gonna see again.

256
00:25:25,589 --> 00:25:27,757
I don't know
how you feel about this.

257
00:25:29,160 --> 00:25:30,895
I know we just met,

258
00:25:31,061 --> 00:25:33,330
but I can read the cards.

259
00:25:33,931 --> 00:25:36,234
-Cards?
-Yes.

260
00:25:36,834 --> 00:25:38,233
What, do you mean
like tarot cards?

261
00:25:38,234 --> 00:25:42,739
Okay.

262
00:25:43,307 --> 00:25:45,176
I'll go get them.

263
00:25:57,288 --> 00:25:59,157
Cut.

264
00:26:11,402 --> 00:26:14,804
Interesting.

265
00:26:14,805 --> 00:26:16,005
What?

266
00:26:16,006 --> 00:26:19,976
According to the cards,
you will see again, my darling.

267
00:26:19,977 --> 00:26:22,312
I will?
Well, when?

268
00:26:22,313 --> 00:26:24,279
When does it say?
Look at me, Leela.

269
00:26:24,280 --> 00:26:26,216
I can't keep living like this.

270
00:26:26,784 --> 00:26:29,387
That I can't tell, because
the cards never tell time.

271
00:26:30,253 --> 00:26:31,922
Well, this is a waste.

272
00:26:32,189 --> 00:26:34,190
No, it's not.

273
00:26:34,191 --> 00:26:38,961
Because here says that you need
to accept your moment,

274
00:26:38,962 --> 00:26:41,264
learn your surroundings.

275
00:26:41,365 --> 00:26:43,234
Well, no kidding.

276
00:26:43,901 --> 00:26:47,037
-I gotta go.
-No. I'm sorry.

277
00:26:47,038 --> 00:26:48,438
Please don't.
Please stay.

278
00:26:48,439 --> 00:26:50,306
I'll make you a cup
of tea or something.

279
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,310
I'd love to, darling,

280
00:26:53,277 --> 00:26:55,778
but the energy here's really
getting heavy.

281
00:26:55,779 --> 00:26:57,247
It is bad, isn't it?

282
00:26:59,250 --> 00:27:00,885
It's almost like...

283
00:27:02,219 --> 00:27:04,319
I don't know.
It's a dark presence.

284
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:05,988
I know!

285
00:27:07,023 --> 00:27:08,391
This place has been in
my husband's family for years,

286
00:27:08,392 --> 00:27:10,794
but I had to go somewhere.

287
00:27:10,795 --> 00:27:12,463
I had to get
away from everything.

288
00:27:13,463 --> 00:27:15,932
It's not it.
I'm reading something else.

289
00:27:17,367 --> 00:27:19,268
It's a spirit of a child.

290
00:27:19,269 --> 00:27:21,638
Does that make any sense to you?

291
00:27:27,411 --> 00:27:31,381
It was a little girl,
and she died.

292
00:27:31,382 --> 00:27:33,251
And it was my fault.

293
00:27:35,051 --> 00:27:36,720
Still not it.

294
00:27:37,221 --> 00:27:39,823
This is a spirit
of an unborn child.

295
00:27:42,826 --> 00:27:44,462
Did you have an abortion?

296
00:27:55,905 --> 00:27:59,742
-I can't have kids.
-Sweetie.

297
00:27:59,743 --> 00:28:01,344
It's gonna be okay.

298
00:28:02,145 --> 00:28:04,213
You'll see better than before.

299
00:28:04,214 --> 00:28:06,216
I know it.

300
00:28:06,217 --> 00:28:10,821
Until then, you need to live
like if you won't.

301
00:28:11,821 --> 00:28:12,922
Okay?

302
00:28:12,923 --> 00:28:14,524
It will only benefit you.

303
00:28:23,067 --> 00:28:25,002
You'll be fine.

304
00:28:30,240 --> 00:28:32,342
-Good, señora.
-Si,.

305
00:28:32,343 --> 00:28:33,543
Yes, yes.

306
00:28:33,544 --> 00:28:35,178
That's what therapy
tells you to do:

307
00:28:35,179 --> 00:28:36,211
mark the room.

308
00:28:36,212 --> 00:28:37,514
Okay.
Walk.

309
00:28:37,515 --> 00:28:41,819
One, two, three.

310
00:28:42,219 --> 00:28:43,854
Abre. Open, open.

311
00:28:44,154 --> 00:28:46,322
Open. Close it.

312
00:28:46,323 --> 00:28:48,924
Close it.
There you go.

313
00:28:48,925 --> 00:28:49,959
Okay. We're gonna do it again.

314
00:28:49,960 --> 00:28:51,527
Turn around, turn around.

315
00:28:51,528 --> 00:28:53,328
Good.
One.

316
00:28:53,329 --> 00:28:59,635
Two, three, four, five.

317
00:29:03,406 --> 00:29:05,040
Open.

318
00:29:05,041 --> 00:29:07,010
Keep closed.

319
00:29:08,444 --> 00:29:11,981
-New document.
-New document opened.

320
00:29:12,849 --> 00:29:14,818
My name is Helen.

321
00:29:15,251 --> 00:29:17,120
My name is Helen.

322
00:29:18,888 --> 00:29:22,459
-Save document.
-Document saved.

323
00:29:24,862 --> 00:29:28,766
-Close document.
-Document closed.

324
00:29:52,056 --> 00:29:54,657
Four, five!

325
00:29:54,959 --> 00:29:56,358
Touch.

326
00:29:56,359 --> 00:29:57,994
One, two.

327
00:30:09,038 --> 00:30:10,875
Step slowly.

328
00:30:15,211 --> 00:30:17,013
Remember if they big.

329
00:30:18,582 --> 00:30:21,519
Uno, dos,

330
00:30:23,019 --> 00:30:26,389
tres, cuatro.

331
00:30:26,390 --> 00:30:29,625
Feel the grass.
Feel the grass. Okay.

332
00:30:29,626 --> 00:30:32,161
Now, they're complete.
That's it.

333
00:30:32,162 --> 00:30:34,430
That's it. No more.
No, no, no.

334
00:30:34,431 --> 00:30:37,400
Stand, stand, stand.
Go to the concrete.

335
00:30:37,401 --> 00:30:42,137
Then down.
Then down.

336
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,272
Then down, then down.

337
00:30:43,273 --> 00:30:45,141
Feel the water.

338
00:30:45,142 --> 00:30:46,777
Feel the agua, the agua.

339
00:30:48,612 --> 00:30:50,448
Stand.

340
00:31:24,114 --> 00:31:26,015
Rosa, can you get that?

341
00:31:53,344 --> 00:31:55,678
-Darling!
-Leela.

342
00:31:55,679 --> 00:31:58,048
I was just listening to that CD
that you made for me.

343
00:31:58,414 --> 00:31:59,649
Have you seen Lovey?

344
00:31:59,650 --> 00:32:01,718
I can't find her anywhere.

345
00:32:01,719 --> 00:32:03,787
She's such a bad dog!

346
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:05,822
I haven't seen Lovey.

347
00:32:06,423 --> 00:32:08,624
But then again, I don't see
much of anything these days.

348
00:32:08,625 --> 00:32:10,559
-I'm sorry.
-It's okay.

349
00:32:10,560 --> 00:32:12,228
It's a figure of speech.

350
00:32:12,628 --> 00:32:14,664
But, I haven't heard
from her either.

351
00:32:15,199 --> 00:32:18,433
She's the only thing
in my life I can count on.

352
00:32:18,434 --> 00:32:21,136
You know, I mean,
I go on dates, believe me.

353
00:32:21,137 --> 00:32:24,039
The latest, well,
what a piece of work.

354
00:32:24,040 --> 00:32:25,775
Take you to Paris
on one weekend.

355
00:32:25,776 --> 00:32:28,811
And on the other one,
he stands me up for dinner.

356
00:32:29,346 --> 00:32:32,148
Really? Who am I
to take such behavior?

357
00:32:33,483 --> 00:32:35,885
I think he's seeing
someone else too.

358
00:32:36,119 --> 00:32:38,387
I mean, it's not
like I ask him to be exclusive.

359
00:32:38,388 --> 00:32:41,758
It's just, he should be honest.

360
00:32:42,125 --> 00:32:43,761
None of them are.

361
00:32:44,461 --> 00:32:48,232
They all have their little
deep, dark secrets.

362
00:32:49,266 --> 00:32:51,068
Is Arthur like that too?

363
00:32:51,567 --> 00:32:53,236
I hope not.

364
00:32:54,270 --> 00:32:56,104
Well, I carry on too much.

365
00:32:56,105 --> 00:32:57,373
If you see Lovey,
please be a dear

366
00:32:57,374 --> 00:32:58,441
and let me know.

367
00:32:58,442 --> 00:32:59,808
Yeah, of course.

368
00:32:59,809 --> 00:33:02,745
The little devil,
worrying me to pieces!

369
00:33:02,746 --> 00:33:05,213
Don't worry.
She's gonna come back.

370
00:33:10,421 --> 00:33:12,089
Are you okay, darling?

371
00:33:14,625 --> 00:33:16,593
If you see Lovey, call me.

372
00:33:18,362 --> 00:33:22,666
You remember,
just press the nine.

373
00:33:25,134 --> 00:33:26,704
Okay, I gotta go.

374
00:33:45,088 --> 00:33:46,923
Six twenty-three p.m.

375
00:33:50,259 --> 00:33:52,830
Six twenty-four p.m.

376
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:57,901
The time is...

377
00:33:58,801 --> 00:34:01,371
The time is 6:24p.m.

378
00:34:04,441 --> 00:34:06,076
What's that?

379
00:34:08,144 --> 00:34:09,779
It's a talking watch.

380
00:34:10,514 --> 00:34:12,750
You program it
and it tells you the time.

381
00:34:13,182 --> 00:34:14,484
It's kind of hard
to know what time it is

382
00:34:14,485 --> 00:34:15,750
when it's always dark.

383
00:34:15,751 --> 00:34:18,121
Can't be that dark
with your natural glow.

384
00:34:22,126 --> 00:34:23,994
What is this?

385
00:34:25,329 --> 00:34:27,164
It's a bear.

386
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:29,732
You got me a bear?

387
00:34:29,733 --> 00:34:31,402
Yeah, it's supposed
to be a surprise.

388
00:34:31,568 --> 00:34:33,401
Honey, that's really sweet.

389
00:34:33,402 --> 00:34:35,038
That's me.

390
00:34:45,648 --> 00:34:48,918
-Are you coming?
-Be there in a minute.

391
00:34:51,855 --> 00:34:53,424
Lovey!
What?

392
00:34:54,391 --> 00:34:56,259
Leela's dog!

393
00:34:56,860 --> 00:34:59,562
-What are you talking about?
-Come on. Leela lost her dog.

394
00:34:59,563 --> 00:35:01,197
I think I hear her.

395
00:35:04,434 --> 00:35:06,801
Come on.
C'mon.

396
00:35:06,802 --> 00:35:08,438
C'mon.

397
00:35:16,413 --> 00:35:18,982
Lovey!

398
00:35:22,652 --> 00:35:25,088
-What are you doing?
-Lovey!

399
00:35:25,422 --> 00:35:26,355
I know you're in here, baby.

400
00:35:26,356 --> 00:35:28,357
Come here!
Come here!

401
00:35:28,358 --> 00:35:29,860
Come here!
Come here!

402
00:35:31,260 --> 00:35:32,895
-Jesus...
-My gosh, what're you...

403
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,462
Told you I heard her.

404
00:35:34,463 --> 00:35:35,564
I knew it.

405
00:35:35,565 --> 00:35:37,866
Baby.

406
00:35:37,867 --> 00:35:40,335
How'd you get in here?

407
00:35:40,336 --> 00:35:41,736
How did you know?

408
00:35:41,737 --> 00:35:43,406
I told you that
I heard something.

409
00:35:44,740 --> 00:35:45,841
What is this?

410
00:35:45,842 --> 00:35:47,811
It looks like a dog toy.

411
00:35:50,313 --> 00:35:52,547
No. This is a doll.

412
00:35:52,548 --> 00:35:54,649
Leela's a strange bird.

413
00:35:54,650 --> 00:35:55,951
She came by the house again?

414
00:35:55,952 --> 00:35:58,221
-You two buddies now?
-Yeah.

415
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,323
She seems to be
very fond of you.

416
00:36:00,324 --> 00:36:01,524
She's just...

417
00:36:01,525 --> 00:36:02,991
She's lived here a long time.

418
00:36:02,992 --> 00:36:06,830
I've seen her around when I came
by to work on the place.

419
00:36:07,898 --> 00:36:09,832
Here, we need to get you home.
Mommy's missing you.

420
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,902
Here.

421
00:36:12,735 --> 00:36:14,370
Take that.

422
00:36:15,938 --> 00:36:17,573
Don't forget the doll.

423
00:36:17,574 --> 00:36:19,243
Come on.

424
00:36:43,867 --> 00:36:45,502
I love the bear.

425
00:36:49,438 --> 00:36:51,374
What have you and Leela
been talking about?

426
00:36:51,942 --> 00:36:54,143
Just girl stuff.

427
00:36:54,744 --> 00:36:56,379
Don't worry about it.

428
00:36:57,847 --> 00:36:59,882
Yeah.

429
00:38:01,844 --> 00:38:04,080
Don't let me go!

430
00:38:12,521 --> 00:38:14,457
-No, no, no! No, no, no...
-What is it, honey?

431
00:38:14,757 --> 00:38:16,591
It's okay.
It's okay.

432
00:38:16,592 --> 00:38:18,361
It was just a bad dream.

433
00:38:18,494 --> 00:38:19,861
How could I let that happen?

434
00:38:19,862 --> 00:38:23,100
She shouldn't
have been wandering off.

435
00:38:24,101 --> 00:38:26,602
-I have to get some water.
-I'll get it for you.

436
00:38:26,603 --> 00:38:29,105
No, I have to do it myself.

437
00:38:29,606 --> 00:38:32,109
-But you're upset.
-I'm okay.

438
00:39:19,054 --> 00:39:21,557
Arthur, I told you
that I can do it myself.

439
00:39:34,704 --> 00:39:36,373
Is anybody out here?

440
00:39:42,711 --> 00:39:44,380
Arthur?

441
00:39:51,121 --> 00:39:52,721
Easy.

442
00:39:52,722 --> 00:39:53,955
What are you doing?

443
00:39:53,956 --> 00:39:56,892
-I heard something.
-Again?

444
00:39:56,893 --> 00:39:58,694
Come on. Let's go to bed.

445
00:39:58,695 --> 00:39:59,595
No, I heard it.
It was right...

446
00:39:59,596 --> 00:40:00,663
I heard...
Stop!

447
00:40:00,664 --> 00:40:01,897
There is nothing out here.

448
00:40:01,898 --> 00:40:03,667
I took the dog back.

449
00:40:03,967 --> 00:40:05,767
You could've really
hurt yourself this time.

450
00:40:05,768 --> 00:40:08,371
-Believe me, I did.
-Look, I just...

451
00:40:08,838 --> 00:40:13,174
I think you're just making
too much out of nothing.

452
00:40:13,175 --> 00:40:15,544
Okay? You have to let it go.

453
00:40:15,545 --> 00:40:17,214
It was an accident.

454
00:40:44,206 --> 00:40:46,142
I left you some extra money.

455
00:40:46,208 --> 00:40:49,078
Go out. Get a massage,
or go on a picnic.

456
00:40:49,079 --> 00:40:51,381
You need to relax.

457
00:40:56,119 --> 00:40:57,788
I'll see you later.

458
00:41:15,771 --> 00:41:17,273
This was Arthur's idea.

459
00:41:18,974 --> 00:41:20,709
Si, señora.

460
00:41:20,710 --> 00:41:23,246
You y el doctor
have a very nice property.

461
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,080
Well, as long as I'm out
here, will you tell me

462
00:41:26,081 --> 00:41:28,150
what I'm missing?

463
00:41:29,318 --> 00:41:31,554
The trees, the grass...

464
00:41:31,820 --> 00:41:33,489
The usual things.

465
00:41:34,257 --> 00:41:38,227
-Describe it.
-We have sun.

466
00:41:38,228 --> 00:41:40,263
We have the flores.

467
00:41:40,630 --> 00:41:42,565
Señora, all is good.

468
00:41:48,938 --> 00:41:50,573
I bring you the food now.

469
00:41:51,608 --> 00:41:53,110
Tell me about the birds.

470
00:41:55,612 --> 00:41:57,214
No. No birds.

471
00:41:58,014 --> 00:41:59,616
Donde, aquí.

472
00:42:01,952 --> 00:42:03,285
Maybe one over there,

473
00:42:03,286 --> 00:42:05,154
a black one.

474
00:42:05,288 --> 00:42:07,523
Just one.

475
00:42:09,259 --> 00:42:10,125
Ay, señora.
I'm tired.

476
00:42:10,126 --> 00:42:12,162
I sit.

477
00:42:19,869 --> 00:42:21,669
Rosa?

478
00:42:21,670 --> 00:42:26,441
Hey.
Rosa.

479
00:42:27,677 --> 00:42:29,146
How long have you
known Arthur?

480
00:42:32,148 --> 00:42:33,716
I'll tell you if you tell me.

481
00:42:33,717 --> 00:42:35,385
Que tal?

482
00:42:36,619 --> 00:42:38,288
Deal.

483
00:42:39,389 --> 00:42:41,224
I don't know.

484
00:42:41,958 --> 00:42:43,927
Whenever he needs something,
he call me.

485
00:42:46,228 --> 00:42:48,163
How often does he come here?

486
00:42:48,164 --> 00:42:50,200
Your turn.

487
00:42:51,934 --> 00:42:54,203
Well, my father was ill
for a couple of years.

488
00:42:55,170 --> 00:42:56,672
And Arthur was his doctor,

489
00:42:56,940 --> 00:42:59,308
and used to come
by the house once a week

490
00:42:59,309 --> 00:43:01,177
to check on him.

491
00:43:02,978 --> 00:43:05,814
-Sometimes...
-Sometimes what?

492
00:43:06,148 --> 00:43:08,551
Sometimes he come,
sometimes he go.

493
00:43:09,985 --> 00:43:11,453
Does he ever
bring anybody here?

494
00:43:13,188 --> 00:43:15,257
Where's your father?

495
00:43:16,659 --> 00:43:20,263
He died 2 years ago.

496
00:43:21,030 --> 00:43:22,898
And then Arthur and I got
married right after that.

497
00:43:25,969 --> 00:43:27,136
I don't know, Señora.

498
00:43:27,137 --> 00:43:28,437
I never see anybody.

499
00:43:28,438 --> 00:43:30,273
I just clean.

500
00:43:35,311 --> 00:43:37,847
Rosa, do you ever hear
weird noises in this house?

501
00:43:42,952 --> 00:43:44,588
Rosa?

502
00:43:47,257 --> 00:43:48,824
-Sometimes...
-You do?

503
00:43:49,224 --> 00:43:50,893
What kind of noises?

504
00:43:54,764 --> 00:43:56,532
Sometimes I cannot
find things.

505
00:43:58,168 --> 00:43:59,234
Do you think that maybe
this house could be haunted?

506
00:43:59,235 --> 00:44:01,003
It's late, Señora.

507
00:44:01,237 --> 00:44:03,273
Let's go inside.

508
00:44:04,807 --> 00:44:06,174
I have to do the laundry.

509
00:44:06,175 --> 00:44:08,877
Y el doctor likes
all of his shirts to be ironed.

510
00:44:10,847 --> 00:44:12,281
He likes things
the way he likes them.

511
00:44:12,282 --> 00:44:13,950
Si, vamono.

512
00:44:14,951 --> 00:44:16,250
Up.

513
00:44:16,251 --> 00:44:17,886
There's a pool in front.

514
00:44:19,322 --> 00:44:20,991
Slowly.

515
00:44:25,829 --> 00:44:27,497
Good.

516
00:44:34,871 --> 00:44:36,906
-What is this?
-It's a doll.

517
00:44:42,045 --> 00:44:44,513
This is Lovey's doll.
What's it doing here?

518
00:44:44,514 --> 00:44:46,247
I don't know.

519
00:44:46,248 --> 00:44:48,250
Maybe he drop it?

520
00:44:48,251 --> 00:44:50,020
Nobody told me
he brought it back.

521
00:44:51,153 --> 00:44:53,290
I don't know, señora.
Maybe he drop it.

522
00:44:54,523 --> 00:44:56,359
Vamono.

523
00:45:12,074 --> 00:45:13,375
Hi, honey.

524
00:45:13,376 --> 00:45:15,444
Hey. You look good.

525
00:45:15,445 --> 00:45:16,879
Did you get out
like I told you?

526
00:45:16,880 --> 00:45:18,212
I did.

527
00:45:18,213 --> 00:45:19,882
I found something.

528
00:45:23,085 --> 00:45:24,687
You said that
you brought it back to Leela.

529
00:45:25,221 --> 00:45:26,821
I don't know.
I guess I forgot.

530
00:45:26,822 --> 00:45:28,022
I got a lot on my mind.

531
00:45:28,023 --> 00:45:29,792
You know, patients,

532
00:45:30,260 --> 00:45:32,294
you and what you're
going through...

533
00:45:32,295 --> 00:45:34,096
-But I handed it to you.
-I don't know.

534
00:45:34,097 --> 00:45:35,765
I guess I forgot.

535
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:38,399
Well, we need
to give it back to her.

536
00:45:38,400 --> 00:45:39,433
The dog's going
to come back for it.

537
00:45:39,434 --> 00:45:41,670
Okay.
I'll take it back later.

538
00:45:41,871 --> 00:45:43,706
No.
You need to call her right now.

539
00:45:45,407 --> 00:45:47,375
Okay. I'll call her.

540
00:45:47,376 --> 00:45:49,011
Okay. Put it on speaker.

541
00:45:52,949 --> 00:45:54,617
She's not home.

542
00:45:55,050 --> 00:45:56,417
-Hi, there.
-Leela!

543
00:45:56,418 --> 00:45:58,453
Yes, it's me,
but I'm not here.

544
00:45:58,454 --> 00:46:00,357
So you know what to do.

545
00:46:01,123 --> 00:46:02,290
Guess she's not home.

546
00:46:02,291 --> 00:46:03,960
We'll try again later.

547
00:48:34,210 --> 00:48:35,777
It's my doll.

548
00:48:37,347 --> 00:48:39,015
Arthur, where are you?

549
00:48:39,548 --> 00:48:40,614
-What happened?
-My god.

550
00:48:40,615 --> 00:48:44,018
I saw a little girl. No.

551
00:48:44,019 --> 00:48:47,122
-It was just a dream.
-No. No, she was here.

552
00:48:47,123 --> 00:48:48,756
I was awake.
I was not in bed.

553
00:48:48,757 --> 00:48:53,261
-You were sleepwalking.
-No. It was real. It was real.

554
00:48:53,262 --> 00:48:55,596
Helen, you have got
to stop this.

555
00:48:55,597 --> 00:48:57,165
-No. No, you...
-You're going insane...

556
00:48:57,166 --> 00:49:00,201
-No...
-And you're driving me crazy.

557
00:49:00,202 --> 00:49:02,004
-Why don't you believe me?
-You're upset.

558
00:49:02,005 --> 00:49:03,571
-No, I'm not.
-You need to calm down.

559
00:49:03,572 --> 00:49:05,374
No! I saw her!

560
00:49:05,375 --> 00:49:07,642
-I'll get you something.
-No, I don't want anything!

561
00:49:07,643 --> 00:49:10,011
It was real!
Please, no.

562
00:49:10,012 --> 00:49:11,712
I don't want anything.

563
00:49:11,713 --> 00:49:12,781
No, no, no, no.

564
00:49:12,782 --> 00:49:14,784
Please.

565
00:49:15,485 --> 00:49:16,685
-Sit...
-No, no...

566
00:49:16,686 --> 00:49:18,787
-And wait for me here.
-It was the girl.

567
00:49:18,788 --> 00:49:20,656
She was here.

568
00:49:21,123 --> 00:49:23,025
She won't let me be free.

569
00:49:27,663 --> 00:49:29,296
Put it in your mouth
and swallow.

570
00:49:29,297 --> 00:49:31,867
-No, I don't...
-Do it, or I'll do it for you.

571
00:49:32,335 --> 00:49:34,137
-It happened.
-I know.

572
00:49:35,605 --> 00:49:37,172
That's a good girl.

573
00:49:42,144 --> 00:49:45,046
-When's it going to stop?
-When you forgive yourself.

574
00:49:45,047 --> 00:49:46,281
Now, lie down.

575
00:49:46,282 --> 00:49:47,951
How can I forgive myself?

576
00:49:48,284 --> 00:49:50,152
I was such an idiot.

577
00:49:50,353 --> 00:49:52,754
Trying to take care
of a bunch of little girls

578
00:49:52,755 --> 00:49:54,924
when I can't even be a real mom.

579
00:49:55,324 --> 00:49:56,993
You were just
trying to give back.

580
00:49:57,492 --> 00:49:59,094
I was playing with dolls.

581
00:49:59,829 --> 00:50:01,529
Just get some sleep,
princess.

582
00:50:01,530 --> 00:50:02,663
You'll feel better
in the morning.

583
00:50:02,664 --> 00:50:04,566
Doll... The doll.
She took the doll.

584
00:50:04,567 --> 00:50:06,600
No, no, no. Lie down.

585
00:50:06,601 --> 00:50:09,138
-She did. She took it.
-Get some rest.

586
00:50:12,608 --> 00:50:14,243
That's a good girl.

587
00:50:17,746 --> 00:50:19,080
Good morning, señora.

588
00:50:19,081 --> 00:50:20,649
You sleeping late today.

589
00:50:20,650 --> 00:50:23,551
El doctor, he left.
Did he say anything?

590
00:50:23,552 --> 00:50:26,254
He say he want
me to wash the patio.

591
00:50:26,389 --> 00:50:29,124
-No, I mean about last night.
-No, señora.

592
00:50:29,125 --> 00:50:31,761
Mira. These come for you today.

593
00:50:34,764 --> 00:50:36,698
-Is there a card?
-Si, señora.

594
00:50:36,699 --> 00:50:38,368
Tenga.

595
00:50:39,802 --> 00:50:43,605
-Well, what does it say?
-No, señora.

596
00:50:43,606 --> 00:50:45,272
No, no. My English
is no good for reading.

597
00:50:45,273 --> 00:50:46,174
-No, no, no...
-Talking, yes,

598
00:50:46,175 --> 00:50:47,442
pero reading, no.

599
00:50:47,443 --> 00:50:50,747
-Please try.
-Okay. I try.

600
00:50:52,581 --> 00:50:55,717
"For gift, you silly Helen.

601
00:50:55,784 --> 00:50:57,870
I love you.

602
00:50:57,871 --> 00:50:59,421
Arthur."

603
00:50:59,621 --> 00:51:01,256
I take this.

604
00:51:01,657 --> 00:51:04,158
I think this has all
been a lot for him too.

605
00:51:04,159 --> 00:51:05,893
Don't you think?

606
00:51:05,894 --> 00:51:07,294
I don't know, señora.

607
00:51:07,295 --> 00:51:08,696
Mira.

608
00:51:08,697 --> 00:51:11,366
My mother always say that
if you do something

609
00:51:11,367 --> 00:51:15,238
to make your husband sad,
make him a nice dinner.

610
00:51:15,471 --> 00:51:17,373
He forget about everything.

611
00:51:20,175 --> 00:51:22,243
-Let's do it.
-Yes?

612
00:51:22,244 --> 00:51:24,112
Vamono.

613
00:51:26,516 --> 00:51:28,184
Hola, señora.

614
00:51:28,784 --> 00:51:30,420
I'm setting the table.

615
00:51:34,891 --> 00:51:37,860
-I think we need some wine.
-El doctor has wine.

616
00:51:38,628 --> 00:51:41,097
-Where is it?
-In the basement.

617
00:51:41,496 --> 00:51:43,365
He keeps wine
in the basement?

618
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:46,235
When the boxes come, I just
put 'em in the front door.

619
00:51:46,402 --> 00:51:48,237
He likes to put
the wine there himself.

620
00:51:48,704 --> 00:51:49,870
Good.

621
00:51:49,871 --> 00:51:52,107
Will you take me down there
so I can see what we have?

622
00:52:12,594 --> 00:52:13,694
Is this it?

623
00:52:13,695 --> 00:52:15,897
-Si, señora.
-Well, open the door.

624
00:52:15,898 --> 00:52:17,598
No, señora.

625
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,301
El doctor say to me
never to go in.

626
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,569
I don't want to do something
to make him upset with me.

627
00:52:21,570 --> 00:52:23,205
Okay, fine.
I get it.

628
00:52:23,338 --> 00:52:25,007
I'll be the bad girl.

629
00:53:22,731 --> 00:53:24,400
Rosa?

630
00:53:24,900 --> 00:53:28,003
-What happened, señora?
-Nothing. I just got scared.

631
00:53:30,405 --> 00:53:31,705
Let's go, señora, before...

632
00:53:31,706 --> 00:53:33,707
Let's go.
You know what?

633
00:53:33,708 --> 00:53:35,377
You go.
You go.

634
00:53:37,847 --> 00:53:39,882
Okay.

635
00:53:57,833 --> 00:54:07,976
No! Call Arthur work.

636
00:54:12,715 --> 00:54:14,350
Doctor Boto's office.

637
00:54:15,851 --> 00:54:17,384
Hello?

638
00:54:17,385 --> 00:54:19,054
Can I help you?

639
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,623
Hello?

640
00:54:44,579 --> 00:54:46,248
This was really nice.

641
00:54:50,452 --> 00:54:52,388
I'll get us some more wine.

642
00:54:52,621 --> 00:54:55,957
-That's not necessary.
-It's not a problem.

643
00:54:55,958 --> 00:54:58,359
I can just get more
in the basement. We have plenty.

644
00:54:58,360 --> 00:55:00,794
-No, really. I'm fine.
-Are you sure?

645
00:55:00,795 --> 00:55:03,665
-Yeah. Yeah.
-I just thought...

646
00:55:04,065 --> 00:55:06,101
That's fine.

647
00:55:09,137 --> 00:55:10,839
Are you still in
love with me?

648
00:55:10,840 --> 00:55:13,208
What kind
of silly question is that?

649
00:55:13,675 --> 00:55:15,143
Do you sleep with me
at night?

650
00:55:15,610 --> 00:55:17,446
What are you talking about?

651
00:55:17,746 --> 00:55:18,946
Are you sleeping
in the basement?

652
00:55:18,947 --> 00:55:20,448
What?

653
00:55:20,449 --> 00:55:22,451
I found pillows
and blankets down there.

654
00:55:22,818 --> 00:55:25,787
-This is absurd.
-Well, then what's going on?

655
00:55:25,788 --> 00:55:27,522
What's that stuff
doing down there?

656
00:55:27,523 --> 00:55:28,989
I don't know.
This place hasn't been lived in

657
00:55:28,990 --> 00:55:30,424
for a long time.

658
00:55:30,425 --> 00:55:32,660
Maybe someone came in,
a squatter.

659
00:55:32,661 --> 00:55:34,562
But you've been down there.
You've put away wine.

660
00:55:34,563 --> 00:55:35,629
How could you not notice that?

661
00:55:35,630 --> 00:55:37,598
Maybe I stored some stuff
and forgot about it.

662
00:55:37,599 --> 00:55:39,234
What's the difference?

663
00:55:40,402 --> 00:55:42,337
I thought you were
moving on, Helen.

664
00:55:42,704 --> 00:55:45,174
I thought that's
what this dinner was about.

665
00:55:45,541 --> 00:55:47,209
It was.

666
00:55:47,643 --> 00:55:49,576
Something's not right.

667
00:55:49,577 --> 00:55:51,147
You're not right, Helen.

668
00:55:51,780 --> 00:55:53,281
I've had enough.

669
00:57:14,829 --> 00:57:17,265
And you sit there.

670
00:57:18,099 --> 00:57:20,201
And maybe...

671
00:57:22,003 --> 00:57:23,937
Good.

672
00:57:23,938 --> 00:57:26,140
Now, wait.

673
00:57:26,141 --> 00:57:29,244
Everyone's going
to get their turn.

674
00:57:32,047 --> 00:57:33,616
The tea's almost ready.

675
00:57:34,282 --> 00:57:36,151
Who's been good?

676
00:57:41,257 --> 00:57:43,659
You're being very good,

677
00:57:43,958 --> 00:57:46,628
sitting straight and quiet.

678
00:57:48,597 --> 00:57:50,066
You can have your tea.

679
00:57:52,101 --> 00:57:55,471
Careful, it might be hot.

680
00:58:02,844 --> 00:58:08,116
Dolly, I have something
special for you.

681
00:58:09,117 --> 00:58:10,752
It's a surprise.

682
00:58:12,288 --> 00:58:19,761
Introducing Teddy the bear.

683
00:58:21,195 --> 00:58:23,198
Doctor brought us a new friend.

684
00:58:25,166 --> 00:58:27,136
He's so good when he tries.

685
00:58:33,842 --> 00:58:36,445
Teddy, meet Dolly.

686
00:58:38,581 --> 00:58:40,549
Well, how do you
do, Mr. Bear?

687
00:58:41,650 --> 00:58:43,152
Very well, thank you.

688
00:58:43,585 --> 00:58:46,221
Please, call me Teddy.

689
00:58:47,623 --> 00:58:49,056
He's a pretty cool bear.

690
00:58:49,057 --> 00:58:51,127
Right, Dolly?

691
00:58:51,226 --> 00:58:52,895
Yes.

692
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:55,264
I love teddy bears.

693
00:58:56,331 --> 00:58:58,167
I started to worry, though,

694
00:58:59,034 --> 00:59:01,637
when you brought
that woman here, Agnes.

695
00:59:06,074 --> 00:59:09,410
You don't need
to worry about that.

696
00:59:10,878 --> 00:59:14,850
Doctor said
she means nothing to him.

697
00:59:16,619 --> 00:59:22,858
Besides, she's blind, useless

698
00:59:23,891 --> 00:59:26,661
and going cuckoo,

699
00:59:28,297 --> 00:59:29,931
he said.

700
00:59:30,733 --> 00:59:32,635
But what if she stays?

701
00:59:38,172 --> 00:59:41,209
Then I'll take care of her.

702
00:59:44,780 --> 00:59:47,215
Now, let's stop
this boring conversation.

703
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,886
Doctor said he's
going to bring us

704
00:59:52,887 --> 00:59:55,756
something really special
for our tea parties.

705
00:59:55,757 --> 00:59:57,325
What is it?
What is it?

706
00:59:58,027 --> 01:00:02,630
It's a real bell
to call for tea.

707
01:00:03,965 --> 01:00:05,634
Hooray!

708
01:00:07,436 --> 01:00:09,538
Let's cheer for the doctor.

709
01:00:11,106 --> 01:00:14,210
Hip hip hooray!

710
01:00:35,297 --> 01:00:36,931
What's the matter?

711
01:00:39,001 --> 01:00:42,905
-I'm just thirsty.
-Everything okay?

712
01:00:43,905 --> 01:00:45,741
Yeah.

713
01:00:46,208 --> 01:00:47,676
You don't look
so good, Helen.

714
01:00:49,177 --> 01:00:52,013
We have to do something
about these nightmares,

715
01:00:52,081 --> 01:00:53,714
put an end to them.

716
01:00:53,715 --> 01:00:54,984
Yeah, they have to stop.

717
01:00:59,487 --> 01:01:01,322
Let's get back to bed.

718
01:01:02,791 --> 01:01:04,260
I think I'm going
to take a bath.

719
01:01:04,358 --> 01:01:05,994
You really need...

720
01:01:07,161 --> 01:01:09,464
Yeah. Yeah, I need to relax.

721
01:01:11,266 --> 01:01:12,900
Whatever you need.

722
01:01:18,806 --> 01:01:20,441
You okay in there?

723
01:01:21,175 --> 01:01:23,044
I'm fine.

724
01:01:23,846 --> 01:01:28,284
You need me
to turn on the water?

725
01:01:30,251 --> 01:01:32,288
No, I got it.

726
01:01:34,289 --> 01:01:35,958
Let me help you.

727
01:01:37,358 --> 01:01:42,063
-I'm okay.
-You sure?

728
01:01:42,164 --> 01:01:43,864
I'm just going
to be a while, okay?

729
01:01:43,865 --> 01:01:45,400
Just get some rest.

730
01:02:06,288 --> 01:02:09,090
The time is 11:31.

731
01:02:10,324 --> 01:02:11,993
Rosa?

732
01:02:14,096 --> 01:02:15,931
Rosa.

733
01:02:26,375 --> 01:02:28,009
Call Rosa.

734
01:02:31,112 --> 01:02:33,415
Rosa, where are you?

735
01:02:34,081 --> 01:02:35,717
Why aren't you here?

736
01:02:38,085 --> 01:02:39,654
He told you not to come?

737
01:02:40,922 --> 01:02:42,290
No, no, no.
That's not true.

738
01:02:42,291 --> 01:02:45,292
I need you here.
Can't you get a bus?

739
01:02:45,293 --> 01:02:49,098
Or... Okay, forget it.

740
01:02:49,831 --> 01:02:51,532
Come tomorrow, okay?

741
01:03:01,476 --> 01:03:03,112
Call Leela.

742
01:03:05,514 --> 01:03:07,382
Leela!

743
01:03:07,916 --> 01:03:09,485
Something's going on.

744
01:03:18,126 --> 01:03:19,125
No.
What's the matter?

745
01:03:19,126 --> 01:03:20,628
What's wrong, sweetie?

746
01:03:22,496 --> 01:03:24,631
I need to have you look
in the basement for me, okay?

747
01:03:24,632 --> 01:03:26,200
Okay.

748
01:03:26,201 --> 01:03:28,036
Why?

749
01:03:28,503 --> 01:03:30,139
There's something strange.

750
01:03:30,338 --> 01:03:31,973
Strange?

751
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:40,916
What do you see?

752
01:03:41,148 --> 01:03:42,649
Wine.

753
01:03:42,650 --> 01:03:46,421
-No. What else?
-Nothing.

754
01:03:48,389 --> 01:03:51,959
What about blankets
and pillows and stuff like that?

755
01:03:53,427 --> 01:03:54,928
What are you talking about?

756
01:03:54,929 --> 01:03:56,631
This is a basement.

757
01:03:56,632 --> 01:03:59,600
It's full of boxes.

758
01:03:59,601 --> 01:04:02,335
But it was here.
I know it was.

759
01:04:02,336 --> 01:04:04,671
-Are you sure?
-Yes. I'm sure.

760
01:04:04,672 --> 01:04:06,541
Of course I'm sure.

761
01:04:09,677 --> 01:04:11,980
So, you're saying
you think I imagined it?

762
01:04:12,581 --> 01:04:15,216
I think the mind
is a funny thing, darling,

763
01:04:15,217 --> 01:04:16,616
especially after trauma.

764
01:04:16,617 --> 01:04:18,986
Believe me, I know.

765
01:04:18,987 --> 01:04:21,555
My friend, Susie, she had
this brain thing going on.

766
01:04:21,556 --> 01:04:23,556
She could swear
she was Diana Ross.

767
01:04:23,557 --> 01:04:25,292
No, no, no.
I felt it.

768
01:04:25,293 --> 01:04:26,593
I heard a little girl, okay?

769
01:04:26,594 --> 01:04:27,962
She was talking
and she was playing.

770
01:04:27,963 --> 01:04:29,330
It was so real.

771
01:04:29,331 --> 01:04:30,933
I think
you should tell Arthur.

772
01:04:31,132 --> 01:04:33,667
-No.
-He is a doctor.

773
01:04:33,668 --> 01:04:34,502
No. He's just going
to try to put me

774
01:04:34,503 --> 01:04:36,671
on some kind
of drug or something.

775
01:04:36,672 --> 01:04:39,073
That's what he thinks,
is that drugs fix everything.

776
01:04:39,074 --> 01:04:40,942
But they don't,
and they didn't fix my dad.

777
01:04:41,342 --> 01:04:43,076
Honey, relax.

778
01:04:43,077 --> 01:04:44,979
Arthur used to come
to my house every week

779
01:04:44,980 --> 01:04:47,013
to check on my dad,
always saying that the drugs

780
01:04:47,014 --> 01:04:48,850
he was giving him
were making him better.

781
01:04:49,050 --> 01:04:51,185
And then, 2 years later,
my dad died.

782
01:04:51,652 --> 01:04:53,687
I think you should
give him a chance.

783
01:04:53,688 --> 01:04:56,123
It's also a stressful time
for him too.

784
01:04:57,192 --> 01:04:58,326
Maybe.

785
01:04:58,327 --> 01:04:59,694
Sweetie, I gotta go.

786
01:04:59,695 --> 01:05:02,163
I have this big showing
this afternoon.

787
01:05:02,164 --> 01:05:04,497
But I can come back later
if you need me.

788
01:05:04,498 --> 01:05:06,000
Do not worry.

789
01:05:06,001 --> 01:05:07,033
Relax.

790
01:05:07,034 --> 01:05:09,036
Everything's going to be fine.

791
01:05:37,599 --> 01:05:39,234
Helen?

792
01:05:44,739 --> 01:05:46,574
Honey, I'm home.

793
01:05:49,443 --> 01:05:51,011
What are you doing downstairs?

794
01:05:51,413 --> 01:05:53,747
-What are you doing home?
-I came home early.

795
01:05:53,748 --> 01:05:55,750
I wanted to spend
some time with you.

796
01:05:56,217 --> 01:05:58,052
Well, I don't.

797
01:05:58,487 --> 01:05:59,587
That was a joke.

798
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:01,221
Funny.

799
01:06:01,222 --> 01:06:03,090
I'm going to change.

800
01:06:10,431 --> 01:06:11,765
Did you fall?

801
01:06:11,766 --> 01:06:14,069
-No, I just...
-What are you doing?

802
01:06:14,202 --> 01:06:16,169
I just... What is this?

803
01:06:16,170 --> 01:06:17,805
Nothing.

804
01:06:18,773 --> 01:06:20,641
Come on.

805
01:06:21,143 --> 01:06:22,810
We've had such a time.

806
01:06:22,811 --> 01:06:25,347
I know it's been hard.
I want to make it up to you.

807
01:06:26,047 --> 01:06:28,082
-No, I'm fine.
-I'm taking you out.

808
01:06:28,083 --> 01:06:29,183
Get dressed.

809
01:06:29,184 --> 01:06:30,584
I'm...

810
01:06:30,585 --> 01:06:31,451
You know, I'd really
rather not, Arthur.

811
01:06:31,452 --> 01:06:32,720
It'll be fun.

812
01:06:32,721 --> 01:06:34,321
I'm going to take a shower.

813
01:06:34,322 --> 01:06:35,991
You get yourself
all prettied up.

814
01:07:10,257 --> 01:07:11,892
Aren't you getting ready?

815
01:07:12,527 --> 01:07:14,096
Yeah. I'm almost ready.

816
01:07:44,192 --> 01:07:45,893
You look amazing.

817
01:07:48,563 --> 01:07:50,564
You would never keep anything
from me, would you?

818
01:07:50,565 --> 01:07:52,198
Let's not get too deep.

819
01:07:52,199 --> 01:07:53,533
Let's just go.

820
01:07:53,534 --> 01:07:54,535
No, I don't really
want to go anywhere.

821
01:07:54,536 --> 01:07:57,437
Can we just order something in?

822
01:07:57,438 --> 01:07:58,906
It'll do you good.

823
01:07:58,907 --> 01:08:00,375
You've been inside too much.

824
01:08:01,242 --> 01:08:05,946
-Please?
-Okay.

825
01:08:24,533 --> 01:08:25,899
You're just funny as all.

826
01:08:25,900 --> 01:08:30,105
That's just a little bit more.

827
01:08:31,273 --> 01:08:32,473
What a year.

828
01:08:32,474 --> 01:08:34,142
This whole year.

829
01:08:35,510 --> 01:08:37,145
Nothing...

830
01:09:03,771 --> 01:09:06,974
-What was that?
-Just an animal outside.

831
01:09:06,975 --> 01:09:08,675
No, something just
broke in the kitchen.

832
01:09:08,676 --> 01:09:12,114
-Yeah, somethin' broke.
-No. Arthur, somebody's here.

833
01:09:12,247 --> 01:09:13,782
It's nothing.

834
01:09:13,847 --> 01:09:15,417
It's nothing.

835
01:09:16,417 --> 01:09:18,018
Let's go upstairs.

836
01:09:30,231 --> 01:09:32,366
Will you put that outfit
on for me?

837
01:10:53,047 --> 01:10:54,882
Are you coming?

838
01:11:03,324 --> 01:11:05,159
Come on, already.
I'm waiting.

839
01:11:09,430 --> 01:11:11,031
Looking for the dog again?

840
01:11:11,099 --> 01:11:13,134
No. I just fell.

841
01:11:26,881 --> 01:11:28,614
Okay.

842
01:11:28,615 --> 01:11:30,552
One last toast.

843
01:11:46,835 --> 01:11:48,469
To a new start.

844
01:11:51,538 --> 01:11:52,906
What's wrong?

845
01:11:52,907 --> 01:11:54,907
I don't know.
I think I had too much already.

846
01:11:54,908 --> 01:11:56,645
Well, one more.
It's good for you.

847
01:12:00,715 --> 01:12:02,384
The wine's good, isn't it?

848
01:12:03,016 --> 01:12:04,651
I have to call Rosa.

849
01:12:04,652 --> 01:12:06,386
Now?

850
01:12:06,387 --> 01:12:08,423
I have to make sure
that she comes tomorrow.

851
01:12:08,722 --> 01:12:10,325
Why did you say
you dismissed her today?

852
01:12:11,993 --> 01:12:13,493
Have you seen my phone?

853
01:12:13,494 --> 01:12:14,594
We don't have to do this now.

854
01:12:14,595 --> 01:12:16,363
We can call her tomorrow.

855
01:12:18,166 --> 01:12:20,168
Wait. So why did you...

856
01:12:22,002 --> 01:12:23,637
I think I need to lay down.

857
01:12:25,806 --> 01:12:27,374
That's a good idea.

858
01:12:27,742 --> 01:12:29,377
Lay down.

859
01:12:29,511 --> 01:12:31,044
Have some more wine.

860
01:12:31,045 --> 01:12:32,714
Get some rest.

861
01:12:34,114 --> 01:12:36,951
No. I just want to rest.

862
01:12:41,021 --> 01:12:43,090
Okay.

863
01:12:43,992 --> 01:12:46,328
You get some rest.

864
01:12:48,930 --> 01:12:50,565
I'll be back.

865
01:14:21,088 --> 01:14:24,657
She stays, or I stay.

866
01:14:27,929 --> 01:14:29,531
She stays.

867
01:14:30,931 --> 01:14:32,600
I stay.

868
01:14:34,234 --> 01:14:36,170
She stays.

869
01:14:38,539 --> 01:14:40,174
I stay.

870
01:14:42,743 --> 01:14:44,378
She stays.

871
01:14:47,948 --> 01:14:49,783
I stay.

872
01:14:52,220 --> 01:14:54,089
I will stay in this house.

873
01:14:58,859 --> 01:15:01,195
You promised you'd get
rid of her soon.

874
01:15:02,063 --> 01:15:03,596
She's done.

875
01:15:03,597 --> 01:15:05,266
Trust me.

876
01:15:07,034 --> 01:15:08,703
Drink some milk.

877
01:15:09,203 --> 01:15:11,106
Stop it!

878
01:15:11,905 --> 01:15:14,241
Drink some milk.

879
01:15:19,212 --> 01:15:21,247
Now eat the cookie.
No.

880
01:15:21,248 --> 01:15:23,050
Do you want
to go back to that place?

881
01:15:23,051 --> 01:15:24,585
I got you out of there.

882
01:15:24,586 --> 01:15:25,652
I can send you back
to that hell.

883
01:15:25,653 --> 01:15:27,288
Is that what you want?

884
01:15:28,221 --> 01:15:32,326
You will stop
making these noises.

885
01:15:32,327 --> 01:15:36,228
You will stop
appearing in places

886
01:15:36,229 --> 01:15:37,898
that you do not belong.

887
01:15:37,899 --> 01:15:40,334
You will stay in the cellar
like a good little girl

888
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:42,570
until I have figured this out.

889
01:15:56,818 --> 01:15:58,786
You love me
more than her, don't you?

890
01:15:59,153 --> 01:16:01,222
Of course I do.

891
01:16:01,722 --> 01:16:03,391
I love you the most.

892
01:16:04,091 --> 01:16:08,295
You just have to listen
to what I say.

893
01:16:10,398 --> 01:16:15,270
After tonight, it'll just
be you and me.

894
01:16:16,837 --> 01:16:18,572
I'm tired of hiding.

895
01:16:19,873 --> 01:16:21,543
I love you.

896
01:16:25,113 --> 01:16:28,782
Promise me you'll do as I say.

897
01:16:29,384 --> 01:16:31,252
Promise.

898
01:16:37,091 --> 01:16:38,793
I love you too, princess.

899
01:17:21,202 --> 01:17:22,904
We have to find her.

900
01:17:28,109 --> 01:17:31,846
Helen, darling,
where are you?

901
01:17:32,079 --> 01:17:33,815
You can't hide from me.

902
01:17:47,194 --> 01:17:48,961
-Lila.
-Hello?

903
01:17:48,962 --> 01:17:51,331
Hello? Hi, there.

904
01:17:51,332 --> 01:17:53,265
-Hello?
-It's Helen. I...

905
01:17:53,266 --> 01:17:56,704
-Helen?
-Helen?

906
01:17:57,337 --> 01:17:59,007
Hello?

907
01:18:08,181 --> 01:18:10,017
Doctor?

908
01:18:10,984 --> 01:18:13,886
Is that you?
Doctor, she's here!

909
01:18:13,887 --> 01:18:15,356
She's here!

910
01:18:17,859 --> 01:18:19,291
Listen to me.
I'm not going to hurt you.

911
01:18:19,292 --> 01:18:20,527
I'm not going to hurt you.
I have a secret to tell you.

912
01:18:20,528 --> 01:18:22,030
I have a secret to tell you.

913
01:18:22,296 --> 01:18:24,197
Quiet.
I swear.

914
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:25,831
The doctor's not good, okay?

915
01:18:25,832 --> 01:18:27,768
-Shut up!
-No, no, no, no, no, no, no.

916
01:18:28,903 --> 01:18:29,702
Okay.
Okay.

917
01:18:29,703 --> 01:18:31,904
So the bear,
the bear, the bear,

918
01:18:31,905 --> 01:18:33,206
it was for you, wasn't it?

919
01:18:33,207 --> 01:18:35,543
Wasn't it?
But he gave it to me.

920
01:18:36,810 --> 01:18:38,312
You had to come get it,
didn't you?

921
01:18:41,481 --> 01:18:43,317
What's your name?

922
01:18:44,952 --> 01:18:46,419
Agnes.

923
01:18:46,420 --> 01:18:48,955
Agnes, what the doctor's
doing to you...

924
01:18:50,423 --> 01:18:52,627
He's sick, okay?
He's really sick.

925
01:18:53,828 --> 01:18:55,997
He got close to me
when I lost my dad

926
01:18:56,229 --> 01:18:58,130
and I needed someone.

927
01:18:58,131 --> 01:18:59,366
Now, I'm no good
for him anymore.

928
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,001
He's just gonna do
the same thing to you.

929
01:19:01,002 --> 01:19:03,969
-He loves me!
-No, stop it!

930
01:19:03,970 --> 01:19:05,505
You have to believe me.

931
01:19:05,506 --> 01:19:07,206
He's going to hurt you, okay?

932
01:19:07,207 --> 01:19:09,042
You're right.

933
01:19:10,278 --> 01:19:11,946
I'm prettier than you.

934
01:19:12,445 --> 01:19:13,981
That's why he loves me more.

935
01:19:14,280 --> 01:19:18,585
He says my kisses
are like strawberries.

936
01:19:18,920 --> 01:19:21,022
He calls me his princess.

937
01:19:22,323 --> 01:19:24,826
-Of course he does.
-We don't need you.

938
01:19:25,059 --> 01:19:26,526
We'll get rid of you.

939
01:19:26,527 --> 01:19:27,460
He can't be trusted, okay?

940
01:19:27,461 --> 01:19:29,931
He lies.
You're the liar.

941
01:19:30,030 --> 01:19:31,833
Did he tell you
that we're married?

942
01:19:35,368 --> 01:19:39,706
No. He's married to me.

943
01:19:40,507 --> 01:19:44,144
At your age, you should be
playing with other girls,

944
01:19:44,145 --> 01:19:46,381
not thinking
about being married.

945
01:19:47,547 --> 01:19:49,215
He saved me
from the foster home.

946
01:19:51,219 --> 01:19:53,821
I don't want to go back there.
They're so mean to me.

947
01:19:53,954 --> 01:19:56,089
I'm going
to help you find another place.

948
01:19:58,391 --> 01:20:00,895
You can't even help yourself.

949
01:20:02,863 --> 01:20:04,997
Agnes, you have
to trust me, okay?

950
01:20:04,998 --> 01:20:06,633
We have to get out of here.

951
01:20:26,654 --> 01:20:28,689
Helen?

952
01:20:34,328 --> 01:20:36,564
Darling?

953
01:21:05,059 --> 01:21:08,996
-Hey, handsome. Busy?
-Yes, very.

954
01:21:09,697 --> 01:21:11,430
I came to see Helen.
Where is she?

955
01:21:11,431 --> 01:21:13,500
-She's out.
-Out?

956
01:21:13,501 --> 01:21:16,502
She just called me, sounded
like she needed some help.

957
01:21:16,503 --> 01:21:18,304
What the hell
are you talking about?

958
01:21:18,305 --> 01:21:20,640
Take a chill pill, mister.

959
01:21:20,707 --> 01:21:23,109
She probably just
wanted some girl talk.

960
01:21:23,310 --> 01:21:24,945
Sure.

961
01:21:25,645 --> 01:21:27,680
I think she's taking a shower.

962
01:21:27,681 --> 01:21:28,982
No problem.

963
01:21:28,983 --> 01:21:30,651
I can wait.

964
01:21:31,185 --> 01:21:32,854
Fix me a drink?

965
01:21:34,689 --> 01:21:36,557
No.

966
01:21:39,292 --> 01:21:43,830
Do you want to join me?

967
01:21:45,332 --> 01:21:49,169
You know, Arthur, you should be
playing with girls your own age.

968
01:21:49,170 --> 01:21:50,838
Doctor, I found her!

969
01:21:51,238 --> 01:21:53,005
-Hey!
-She's in the bedroom.

970
01:21:53,006 --> 01:21:55,008
I found her.
Not now!

971
01:21:58,011 --> 01:22:00,815
That's a very
dangerous-looking knife.

972
01:22:02,283 --> 01:22:05,117
I was just doing something
in the kitchen.

973
01:22:05,118 --> 01:22:08,822
-Who's the girl?
-My niece, visiting.

974
01:22:12,359 --> 01:22:15,596
Isn't she a little princess?

975
01:22:17,097 --> 01:22:18,699
My name's Agnes.

976
01:22:19,265 --> 01:22:20,868
And I'm not his niece.

977
01:22:21,167 --> 01:22:22,234
I'm his wife.

978
01:22:22,235 --> 01:22:24,004
Shut up, Agnes.

979
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:25,873
Go play.

980
01:22:26,606 --> 01:22:28,241
She's funny.

981
01:22:30,644 --> 01:22:32,213
What the hell's
going on here?

982
01:22:33,480 --> 01:22:35,348
She's a spoiled brat.

983
01:22:35,349 --> 01:22:37,584
She's not actually my niece,

984
01:22:37,585 --> 01:22:40,153
just a girl
trying to help out.

985
01:22:40,154 --> 01:22:41,756
She's from a broken home.

986
01:22:42,622 --> 01:22:44,958
Helen, where are you?

987
01:22:45,359 --> 01:22:46,693
Get out of my way, Arthur.

988
01:22:46,694 --> 01:22:48,996
I told you she's busy!

989
01:22:49,396 --> 01:22:51,566
Are you out of your mind?

990
01:22:52,099 --> 01:22:53,768
Helen?

991
01:22:56,037 --> 01:22:57,672
You know what?

992
01:22:58,271 --> 01:22:59,706
I'm calling the police.

993
01:22:59,707 --> 01:23:03,311
-You're not calling anyone.
-The hell I'm not!

994
01:23:12,118 --> 01:23:13,753
Doctor!

995
01:23:18,059 --> 01:23:19,727
Where did you say Helen was?

996
01:23:22,630 --> 01:23:25,967
Forget about this bitch
and answer my question.

997
01:23:28,335 --> 01:23:30,670
Get back here, you little slut.

998
01:24:01,101 --> 01:24:04,004
Helen, I know you're in here.

999
01:24:06,707 --> 01:24:08,309
Come out, my darling.

1000
01:24:10,411 --> 01:24:12,079
I won't hurt you.

1001
01:25:21,314 --> 01:25:24,118
The time is 11:31 p.m.

1002
01:25:28,756 --> 01:25:30,224
Time's a-ticking.

1003
01:25:31,292 --> 01:25:33,027
Time to face the music.

1004
01:25:35,863 --> 01:25:38,531
You have been running
from one thing

1005
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:41,302
or another all your life, Helen.

1006
01:25:42,203 --> 01:25:44,105
Time to be free of all that.

1007
01:25:47,740 --> 01:25:49,375
There you are.

1008
01:25:53,780 --> 01:25:55,581
I've taken care
of you, haven't I?

1009
01:25:56,317 --> 01:25:59,085
You didn't have to do anything,
just sit there and be pretty.

1010
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:01,922
Isn't that what you wanted,

1011
01:26:03,457 --> 01:26:05,493
a knight in shining armor

1012
01:26:06,793 --> 01:26:09,396
to take you away
and put you in a castle?

1013
01:26:12,332 --> 01:26:17,137
Doctor, Teddy
wants to say hi.

1014
01:26:29,350 --> 01:26:32,751
-Now, I got you both.
-Leave her alone, Arthur.

1015
01:26:32,752 --> 01:26:34,288
You did it to yourself, Helen!

1016
01:26:35,655 --> 01:26:38,124
You fucking did it to yourself!

1017
01:26:42,363 --> 01:26:45,531
Arthur, do whatever
you want to me.

1018
01:26:45,532 --> 01:26:47,301
But do not hurt her.

1019
01:27:05,752 --> 01:27:07,586
Hey. Don't do that.

1020
01:27:07,587 --> 01:27:09,322
Wait. Stop.
Don't go that close.

1021
01:27:09,323 --> 01:27:10,355
Hey. Don't do that. Stop.

1022
01:27:10,356 --> 01:27:11,957
When are they going to stop?

1023
01:27:11,958 --> 01:27:13,526
When you forgive yourself.

1024
01:27:23,037 --> 01:27:26,072
Helen!

1025
01:27:26,539 --> 01:27:28,209
Pull me up!

1026
01:27:34,515 --> 01:27:36,350
Helen!

1027
01:27:36,884 --> 01:27:39,152
-Don't let me fall!
-Don't let me fall!

1028
01:28:17,757 --> 01:28:20,026
-You looked pretty today.
-So do you.

1029
01:28:20,728 --> 01:28:23,097
I like that pink ribbon.

1030
01:28:28,735 --> 01:28:30,303
Got you!
