1
00:02:50,636 --> 00:02:51,704
Ah!

2
00:02:55,842 --> 00:02:58,077
Bravo!

3
00:02:58,143 --> 00:02:59,879
Yay!

4
00:03:17,397 --> 00:03:18,998
That was great!

5
00:03:19,065 --> 00:03:20,433
Do the bird trick!

6
00:03:20,500 --> 00:03:22,335
Bird trick.

7
00:03:23,235 --> 00:03:25,138
Let's hear it

8
00:03:25,204 --> 00:03:28,875
For the amazing, colossal,
stupendous antoine and babette!

9
00:03:38,851 --> 00:03:41,254
Yeah, mr. Antoine!

10
00:03:45,224 --> 00:03:46,860
Aww.

11
00:03:47,060 --> 00:03:48,694
How sweet!

12
00:03:48,761 --> 00:03:50,263
Wait, now.

13
00:03:55,601 --> 00:03:57,036
Wow!

14
00:03:57,103 --> 00:03:58,571
Where did it go?

15
00:04:23,963 --> 00:04:25,398
I'll be back
between shows,

16
00:04:25,465 --> 00:04:26,698
And i want you
ready for bed.

17
00:04:26,766 --> 00:04:28,534
No tv till you
finish that report.

18
00:04:28,601 --> 00:04:30,369
Tell mr. Antoine
the mouse won't eat.

19
00:04:30,435 --> 00:04:32,071
You hear me? No tv.

20
00:04:32,138 --> 00:04:35,241
Now give your mom
a big kiss.

21
00:04:35,308 --> 00:04:37,308
And don't let that
mouse out of the cage.

22
00:04:37,376 --> 00:04:38,811
I won't.

23
00:04:38,878 --> 00:04:41,381
Mrs. Partridge,
i'll be back between shows.

24
00:04:41,447 --> 00:04:42,915
All right.
Drive careful.

25
00:04:42,981 --> 00:04:44,082
Ok. Love you!

26
00:04:44,150 --> 00:04:45,885
Tell mr. Antoine
he won't eat!

27
00:04:45,952 --> 00:04:48,253
Ok. See ya!
Wouldn't want to be ya!

28
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:49,688
Make sure you tell him!

29
00:04:49,755 --> 00:04:51,090
Ok! I will!

30
00:04:51,157 --> 00:04:52,758
Don't forget to!

31
00:04:52,824 --> 00:04:54,327
Ok!

32
00:04:57,629 --> 00:04:59,698
Mr. Antoine
is teaching me

33
00:04:59,765 --> 00:05:01,566
How to make
lightning disappear.

34
00:05:01,633 --> 00:05:03,435
Mm-Hmm.
Sooner the better.

35
00:05:03,502 --> 00:05:05,037
I'm not a mouse person.

36
00:05:05,104 --> 00:05:08,574
Come on. Let's get in here
and do some more tricks.

37
00:05:08,641 --> 00:05:10,376
Attaboy.

38
00:05:21,354 --> 00:05:22,755
I'm going to
call albert.

39
00:05:22,822 --> 00:05:25,358
I'll see you
for the next show.

40
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,094
Say hi to
albert for me.

41
00:05:29,161 --> 00:05:30,663
Aw, thanks.

42
00:05:38,204 --> 00:05:39,304
Hello.

43
00:05:39,371 --> 00:05:41,306
It's lorraine,
mrs. Partridge.

44
00:05:41,373 --> 00:05:43,075
How's my boy?

45
00:05:43,141 --> 00:05:44,977
Oh, he's fine. Fine.

46
00:05:45,043 --> 00:05:48,047
Ate all his vegetables tonight,
even his broccoli.

47
00:05:48,114 --> 00:05:49,816
Good. Good.

48
00:05:49,882 --> 00:05:54,320
Well, i need to go to the market,
and i'll be home within the hour.

49
00:05:54,387 --> 00:05:56,122
Is it my mom?

50
00:05:56,188 --> 00:05:59,558
Hold on.
Here comes mr. Magician.

51
00:05:59,625 --> 00:06:01,794
Mom, i did my
hoover dam report.

52
00:06:01,861 --> 00:06:04,163
I'm going to
read it to you.

53
00:06:04,230 --> 00:06:05,798
I'm coming home
to put you to bed.

54
00:06:05,865 --> 00:06:07,800
You can read it
to me then.

55
00:06:07,867 --> 00:06:09,968
I'll just read you
the first part.

56
00:06:10,035 --> 00:06:12,839
"45 miles from las vegas
is the hoover dam.

57
00:06:12,905 --> 00:06:16,008
It is one of the highest
dams of the entire world."

58
00:06:16,074 --> 00:06:17,075
Ooh!

59
00:06:17,142 --> 00:06:18,678
That's my opener.

60
00:06:18,744 --> 00:06:20,346
Oh, it's stupendous!
I'm hooked!

61
00:06:20,413 --> 00:06:22,347
And the rest of it
when i get home.

62
00:06:22,414 --> 00:06:24,349
And i want you to brush
your teeth.

63
00:06:24,416 --> 00:06:25,317
Hi, albert, honey!

64
00:06:25,384 --> 00:06:26,518
It's ruthie.

65
00:06:26,585 --> 00:06:27,686
Hi, ruthie!

66
00:06:27,753 --> 00:06:28,654
Mom.

67
00:06:28,721 --> 00:06:30,089
Yeah?

68
00:06:30,156 --> 00:06:32,491
I'm working on mr.
Antoine's card move...

69
00:06:32,558 --> 00:06:34,360
The rise-And-Fall
move he showed me.

70
00:06:34,427 --> 00:06:36,228
I think i got it.
It's all in the wrist.

71
00:06:36,295 --> 00:06:38,764
It's all in the wrist, and
so is brushing your teeth.

72
00:06:38,831 --> 00:06:40,767
Now, i'll be home soon,
and look, albert,

73
00:06:40,833 --> 00:06:43,269
I want you to be gentle
with mrs. Partridge, ok?

74
00:06:43,335 --> 00:06:44,337
She's brittle.

75
00:06:44,403 --> 00:06:45,837
Ok.

76
00:06:45,904 --> 00:06:49,107
Miss rylander gave me an "a"
on my report on ethiopia.

77
00:06:49,174 --> 00:06:51,411
Great. Wonderful.

78
00:06:51,477 --> 00:06:54,479
"Ethiopia is in the
northern part of africa.

79
00:06:54,546 --> 00:06:57,283
"Children in ethiopia
are very hungry.

80
00:06:57,350 --> 00:06:58,951
There was
a drought there."

81
00:06:59,017 --> 00:07:00,452
That means no rain.

82
00:07:00,519 --> 00:07:02,454
Good work, albert!
I love you.

83
00:07:02,521 --> 00:07:06,158
I'll be home soon, but i want you to
brush your teeth and get into bed.

84
00:07:06,225 --> 00:07:07,293
Ok. Ok.

85
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,727
Ok, promise me?

86
00:07:08,794 --> 00:07:09,561
Promise.

87
00:07:09,628 --> 00:07:10,245
Promise?

88
00:07:10,445 --> 00:07:10,863
Promise.

89
00:07:11,063 --> 00:07:12,131
Ok. I love you.

90
00:07:12,198 --> 00:07:13,765
Love you too,
mom. Bye.

91
00:07:13,832 --> 00:07:17,002
Mrs. Partridge,
i have something to show you.

92
00:07:17,069 --> 00:07:18,304
What...Your room?

93
00:07:18,370 --> 00:07:19,304
Yes!

94
00:07:19,371 --> 00:07:20,873
It's a mess.

95
00:07:22,241 --> 00:07:23,642
Ok,
mrs. Partridge,

96
00:07:23,709 --> 00:07:25,444
I have an empty
brown bag.

97
00:07:25,511 --> 00:07:26,745
Uh-Huh.

98
00:07:26,812 --> 00:07:30,816
I will open the brown
paper bag like this.

99
00:07:30,882 --> 00:07:33,486
Now give me
the ketchup bottle.

100
00:07:33,553 --> 00:07:35,153
Careful you don't
break it.

101
00:07:35,220 --> 00:07:36,189
I won't.

102
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:43,328
Put the ketchup
bottle in the bag.

103
00:07:43,395 --> 00:07:44,496
Watch!

104
00:07:44,563 --> 00:07:45,664
Uh-Huh.

105
00:07:45,731 --> 00:07:48,334
Say the magic
words...Sim-Sola-Bim.

106
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:50,335
Poof! It's gone!

107
00:07:50,402 --> 00:07:52,371
Oh, come on, now,
albert.

108
00:07:52,437 --> 00:07:54,040
Nobody's going to
believe that.

109
00:07:54,106 --> 00:07:55,207
Don't like it?

110
00:08:02,047 --> 00:08:04,083
Hee hee hee!

Hello. Is this
the franklin residence?

117
00:09:47,252 --> 00:09:48,987
Yes.

118
00:09:49,054 --> 00:09:52,290
Ma'am,
can we please come inside and talk to you?

119
00:09:52,358 --> 00:09:53,492
Yeah.

120
00:09:53,559 --> 00:09:55,328
Thank you very much.
Thank you.

121
00:09:57,029 --> 00:09:59,198
Ma'am, i regret
to inform you

122
00:09:59,264 --> 00:10:03,469
That mrs. Franklin has been involved
in a very serious vehicle accident.

123
00:10:03,535 --> 00:10:05,871
Mom!

124
00:10:05,938 --> 00:10:08,808
"I am
the resurrection and the life.

125
00:10:08,874 --> 00:10:11,410
"He that believeth in me,
though he were dead,

126
00:10:11,476 --> 00:10:13,545
"Yet shall he live.

127
00:10:13,612 --> 00:10:17,649
"Whosoever liveth and believeth
in me shall never die

128
00:10:17,716 --> 00:10:20,485
But have eternal life
and peace forever."

129
00:10:20,552 --> 00:10:21,987
Amen.

130
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:23,356
Ok. Now.

131
00:10:27,059 --> 00:10:30,496
It is a sad day here.

132
00:10:30,562 --> 00:10:34,433
We are confused.
We do not understand.

133
00:10:34,500 --> 00:10:36,902
Je ne comprends pas.

134
00:10:38,336 --> 00:10:41,140
Tell me, god,

135
00:10:41,207 --> 00:10:45,077
Is life the illusion,
and is death the reality?

136
00:10:52,083 --> 00:10:55,521
What door do you
go through, lorraine,

137
00:10:55,587 --> 00:10:58,424
And where will you
appear again?

138
00:10:59,925 --> 00:11:03,262
Allez. Au revoir,
ma petite.

139
00:11:08,200 --> 00:11:09,969
Bon voyage.

140
00:11:36,194 --> 00:11:37,963
Oh.

141
00:11:41,900 --> 00:11:44,903
"45 miles from las vegas
is the hoover dam.

142
00:11:44,970 --> 00:11:48,574
It is one of the highest dams
in the entire..."

143
00:11:51,577 --> 00:11:53,446
I'm sorry, albert.

144
00:11:55,280 --> 00:11:58,083
Keep reading, baby.
Keep going.

145
00:11:58,149 --> 00:12:00,886
Shouldn't i do this?

146
00:12:00,953 --> 00:12:03,589
It's all right,
mon grand.

147
00:12:03,655 --> 00:12:05,089
Keep reading.

148
00:12:05,156 --> 00:12:07,593
Don't stop, albert.
It's so beautiful.

149
00:12:07,659 --> 00:12:09,093
Yes.

150
00:12:09,160 --> 00:12:11,163
But I'm making
everybody sadder.

151
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:16,602
It's all right,
mon cheri. Go on.

152
00:12:16,668 --> 00:12:18,170
Go.

153
00:12:20,672 --> 00:12:24,610
No. Everybody's
too sad.

154
00:12:24,677 --> 00:12:27,613
Mother
wasn't sad.

155
00:12:27,679 --> 00:12:30,281
My mother was
never sad!

156
00:13:27,939 --> 00:13:30,943
Why can't we keep him?
We could all...

157
00:13:31,010 --> 00:13:34,013
Babette,
this is not a pet, you know.

158
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,180
But he's so little,
and we love him.

159
00:13:36,248 --> 00:13:38,683
Hey, ruthie,
you must know more about the family.

160
00:13:38,750 --> 00:13:39,818
What about
the father?

161
00:13:39,885 --> 00:13:41,352
Yes, ruthie.
The father.

162
00:13:41,419 --> 00:13:42,688
Father?

163
00:13:42,755 --> 00:13:45,590
The father was
just a fly-By-Night.

164
00:13:45,657 --> 00:13:48,893
She thought
he was magic.

165
00:13:48,960 --> 00:13:51,897
Maybe he was, 'cause
he sure did disappear.

166
00:13:51,964 --> 00:13:55,067
I don't even think
she got his last name.

167
00:13:55,133 --> 00:13:56,368
Grandparents?

168
00:13:56,435 --> 00:13:58,569
She didn't
have any family...

169
00:13:58,637 --> 00:14:00,505
No parents,
no grandparents,

170
00:14:00,572 --> 00:14:02,040
No brothers,
no sisters.

171
00:14:02,107 --> 00:14:04,576
She was raised
in a foster home

172
00:14:04,643 --> 00:14:06,078
Back in newark,
new jersey.

173
00:14:06,145 --> 00:14:08,747
If there's no family,
where will albert go?

174
00:14:08,814 --> 00:14:10,582
Why can't i just
stay here?

175
00:14:10,649 --> 00:14:13,986
Albert!
Honey, we thought you were fast asleep.

176
00:14:14,052 --> 00:14:15,487
Come on, honey.

177
00:14:15,553 --> 00:14:17,122
Let's go back
to bed.

178
00:14:17,189 --> 00:14:19,524
Mr. Antoine said
he was my father.

179
00:14:19,591 --> 00:14:21,159
C'est une facon de parler.

180
00:14:21,226 --> 00:14:22,628
It is
an expression.

181
00:14:22,695 --> 00:14:24,696
He loves you
like a father.

182
00:14:24,763 --> 00:14:26,398
Oui. Je t'aime
beaucoup, albert.

183
00:14:26,464 --> 00:14:29,167
You know
you are my favorite.

184
00:14:29,234 --> 00:14:31,903
We all love you,
albert.

185
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:34,706
We would like
to take you with us,

186
00:14:34,773 --> 00:14:36,775
But we move around
so much.

187
00:14:36,842 --> 00:14:38,977
We have no maison...
No home...

188
00:14:39,044 --> 00:14:42,214
And a circus
is not a home.

189
00:14:42,281 --> 00:14:45,483
You were going to teach
me to be a magician.

190
00:14:45,550 --> 00:14:48,887
You said i could be
in the act one day.

191
00:14:48,954 --> 00:14:50,888
I've been practicing.

192
00:14:50,955 --> 00:14:53,225
I'm really good with
the a.B.C. Trick,

193
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:57,796
And i already know the over-The-Falls
and the 50-Cent discovery.

194
00:14:57,863 --> 00:14:59,998
Mrs. Partridge,
you saw me do it.

195
00:15:00,065 --> 00:15:01,900
I fooled you, didn't i?

196
00:15:01,966 --> 00:15:04,202
Yes. You certainly
fooled me.

197
00:15:04,269 --> 00:15:07,406
And my fingers are getting
stronger all the time,

198
00:15:07,472 --> 00:15:08,707
And my wrist.

199
00:15:08,774 --> 00:15:10,276
Look!

200
00:15:13,378 --> 00:15:17,283
See? See?
It's all in the wrist.

201
00:15:34,199 --> 00:15:37,803
To whom it may concern:
in the event of my death,

202
00:15:37,869 --> 00:15:40,939
Please contact my foster sister
harriet franklin.

203
00:15:41,006 --> 00:15:43,442
Even though our lives
have gone separate ways

204
00:15:43,509 --> 00:15:45,744
And it's been many years
since we've spoken,

205
00:15:45,811 --> 00:15:48,947
I've always thought of her as
the godmother of my son albert,

206
00:15:49,014 --> 00:15:51,083
Who i am leaving
in her care.

207
00:15:51,150 --> 00:15:53,651
I believe she will always
be there for albert...

208
00:15:53,719 --> 00:15:56,454
"As harriet and
i were once there for one another.

209
00:15:56,521 --> 00:15:58,957
"She is most likely
still in newark.

210
00:15:59,024 --> 00:16:01,960
I know she'll want to
do the right thing."

211
00:16:02,027 --> 00:16:04,262
Signed,
lorraine franklin.

212
00:16:04,329 --> 00:16:06,298
The boy has a guardian.

213
00:16:06,364 --> 00:16:08,166
It's his godmother...
Harriet franklin.

214
00:16:08,233 --> 00:16:11,337
Any of you
ever heard of her?

215
00:16:13,839 --> 00:16:18,644
Janet, get me directory assistance
for newark, new jersey.

216
00:16:26,918 --> 00:16:29,054
Let me ask harriet, ok?

217
00:16:29,121 --> 00:16:30,488
Hold on. Hold on.

218
00:16:30,555 --> 00:16:31,289
Harriet!

219
00:16:31,356 --> 00:16:32,991
Can you hold on
one second?

220
00:16:33,058 --> 00:16:34,826
What is it?

221
00:16:34,893 --> 00:16:37,629
Mike belasco's claiming we
over-Delivered on the coasters.

222
00:16:37,696 --> 00:16:40,299
Penny, did you remember
to verify the order?

223
00:16:40,365 --> 00:16:42,801
Verbally and in writing,
like you said.

224
00:16:42,867 --> 00:16:45,704
Bob, can you hold on one second?
It's so busy here.

225
00:16:45,770 --> 00:16:47,505
Mike, what's the problem?

226
00:16:47,572 --> 00:16:50,509
No, no, no. We didn't over-Deliver.
You over-Ordered.

227
00:16:50,575 --> 00:16:52,811
What were you thinking,
ordering pink coasters?

228
00:16:52,877 --> 00:16:56,146
You got a cigar manufacturers
convention going on!

229
00:16:56,214 --> 00:16:58,016
No. Hold on a second.

230
00:16:58,083 --> 00:17:00,452
Bob, you still there?
I'll be right with you.

231
00:17:00,519 --> 00:17:03,521
I tell you what.
I'm going to do you a big favor.

232
00:17:03,588 --> 00:17:06,156
You send me back the pink ones,
i'll send you the brown ones,

233
00:17:06,223 --> 00:17:07,492
You pay for shipping.

234
00:17:07,559 --> 00:17:09,828
Ok? I'm going to
put penny on. Penny!

235
00:17:09,895 --> 00:17:10,829
What?

236
00:17:10,895 --> 00:17:12,564
Get on with belasco.

237
00:17:12,631 --> 00:17:14,766
We're finally getting rid of
those goddamn brown coasters.

238
00:17:14,832 --> 00:17:16,568
Bob! Sorry about that.

239
00:17:16,635 --> 00:17:19,704
You know, when you're busy,
the world is on hold.

240
00:17:19,771 --> 00:17:22,674
Now, as i was saying,
i want to get into bigger things, bob.

241
00:17:22,740 --> 00:17:25,710
I want to get into sterilizers
and deep fryers...

242
00:17:27,112 --> 00:17:29,715
To cook things in.
I really feel...

243
00:17:29,781 --> 00:17:32,417
Reliable hotel and restaurant supply.
We're there for you.

244
00:17:32,483 --> 00:17:34,052
Yes?

245
00:17:34,119 --> 00:17:37,389
No. I found a wonderful warehouse.
It's full of inventory.

246
00:17:37,456 --> 00:17:40,190
All you have to do is
come and see it with me.

247
00:17:40,258 --> 00:17:42,060
Make the day. Any day.

248
00:17:42,127 --> 00:17:45,062
Oh, yeah. Yeah.
You just let me know, ok?

249
00:17:45,130 --> 00:17:47,299
Thanks. Bye-Bye.

250
00:17:49,167 --> 00:17:50,601
One moment, please.

251
00:17:52,137 --> 00:17:54,373
Somebody from las vegas
on line 2?

252
00:17:54,439 --> 00:17:56,708
Something about
lorraine, your sister?

253
00:17:56,775 --> 00:17:59,311
I didn't know
you had a sister.

254
00:18:07,652 --> 00:18:09,087
Hello.

255
00:18:09,153 --> 00:18:10,588
Hello. Miss franklin?

256
00:18:10,655 --> 00:18:11,723
Yeah.

257
00:18:11,790 --> 00:18:14,059
Miss franklin,
my name is clay thrasher.

258
00:18:14,126 --> 00:18:17,729
I'm a lawyer at the hotel where
lorraine franklin has been working.

259
00:18:17,795 --> 00:18:19,564
Uh-Oh. What's wrong?

260
00:18:19,631 --> 00:18:21,700
What, is she
in some kind of trouble?

261
00:18:21,766 --> 00:18:25,771
I'm afraid it's worse than trouble,
miss franklin.

262
00:18:25,837 --> 00:18:29,608
Lorraine was killed last week
in an automobile accident.

263
00:18:29,675 --> 00:18:31,109
I'm sorry.

264
00:18:31,176 --> 00:18:33,178
I'm sorry.
What did you say?

265
00:18:34,679 --> 00:18:38,484
Lorraine was killed last week
in an automobile accident.

266
00:18:42,186 --> 00:18:44,422
You are lorraine's
foster sister,

267
00:18:44,489 --> 00:18:47,125
Is that correct,
miss franklin?

268
00:18:47,192 --> 00:18:49,427
You're telling me
lorraine is dead?

269
00:18:49,494 --> 00:18:51,963
Miss franklin,
this is ruth clark.

270
00:18:52,030 --> 00:18:53,431
I was lorraine's
best friend.

271
00:18:53,498 --> 00:18:55,834
We would have
told you sooner,

272
00:18:55,900 --> 00:18:57,135
Except...

273
00:18:57,202 --> 00:18:59,904
We just found out
about you.

274
00:18:59,971 --> 00:19:04,008
We're sorry to break the news
to you this way, miss franklin.

275
00:19:04,075 --> 00:19:06,378
Oh, no. I...

276
00:19:08,280 --> 00:19:12,149
I understand,
and thank you for calling.

277
00:19:12,217 --> 00:19:14,652
No, no. Please
don't hang up.

278
00:19:14,719 --> 00:19:17,956
Miss franklin, there's something
more we need to talk about.

279
00:19:18,023 --> 00:19:19,524
What?

280
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:24,229
It's about albert...
Lorraine's little boy.

281
00:19:25,597 --> 00:19:27,665
Lorraine had a little boy?

282
00:19:27,732 --> 00:19:30,668
Now, what i have
before me, miss franklin,

283
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,772
Are some documents naming
you the boy's guardian.

284
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,673
What?!

285
00:19:35,740 --> 00:19:37,675
Oh. Oh!

286
00:19:37,742 --> 00:19:39,978
No. No. No.

287
00:19:40,045 --> 00:19:41,980
No. No. I...

288
00:19:42,047 --> 00:19:44,583
Uh-Uh. No.

289
00:19:44,649 --> 00:19:46,516
You know, first you tell me
lorraine is dead,

290
00:19:46,584 --> 00:19:48,753
And now you tell me
she's got a kid,

291
00:19:48,820 --> 00:19:50,822
And then you're going to
spring on me

292
00:19:50,889 --> 00:19:52,524
That I'm supposed
to be responsible for it?

293
00:19:52,591 --> 00:19:54,692
He's not an ordinary
boy, miss franklin.

294
00:19:54,759 --> 00:19:57,195
He's really
a wonderful boy, harriet.

295
00:19:57,262 --> 00:19:58,495
He's a magical boy.

296
00:19:58,563 --> 00:20:00,632
Was that him?
Who was that?

297
00:20:00,699 --> 00:20:02,034
I'm antoine.

298
00:20:02,100 --> 00:20:03,167
Who?

299
00:20:03,234 --> 00:20:04,769
Albert's
good friend.

300
00:20:04,836 --> 00:20:07,639
The problem is that right now,
he is a homeless boy.

301
00:20:07,706 --> 00:20:09,741
Well, what about his father?

302
00:20:09,807 --> 00:20:12,344
We can't find the father.
There is no father.

303
00:20:12,410 --> 00:20:14,346
What do you mean,
there is no father?

304
00:20:14,412 --> 00:20:16,547
The boy wasn't immaculately
conceived, was he?

305
00:20:16,614 --> 00:20:19,217
Listen, you people,
let me explain something to you.

306
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,786
I don't have a motherly bone
in my body, ok?

307
00:20:21,853 --> 00:20:24,722
I'm not a mother.
I don't want to be a mother.

308
00:20:24,789 --> 00:20:27,693
Now, i also assume that this
little boy is white, is he not?

309
00:20:27,759 --> 00:20:29,861
Have you got
a problem with that?

310
00:20:29,928 --> 00:20:31,229
Yeah...Just a small one.

311
00:20:31,295 --> 00:20:33,198
'Cause I'm black,
too, you know,

312
00:20:33,265 --> 00:20:35,867
And i think that your sister
would be damned upset with you

313
00:20:35,934 --> 00:20:38,235
If she thought that you
wouldn't take albert

314
00:20:38,303 --> 00:20:40,138
Because you think that
black gets in the way!

315
00:20:40,204 --> 00:20:41,373
That's not what i said.

316
00:20:41,440 --> 00:20:42,907
It didn't bother
his mother,

317
00:20:42,974 --> 00:20:44,676
And you grew up with white folks,
didn't you?

318
00:20:44,742 --> 00:20:46,745
What has my growing up
with white folks

319
00:20:46,811 --> 00:20:48,980
Have to do with me raising
some little white boy?

320
00:20:49,047 --> 00:20:50,715
It's who you are.

321
00:20:50,782 --> 00:20:53,216
You are the closest thing
that he's got to blood!

322
00:20:53,284 --> 00:20:55,053
You understand
the alternative

323
00:20:55,119 --> 00:20:59,057
Would be to place him in the state system,
miss franklin?

324
00:20:59,123 --> 00:21:00,025
No...

325
00:21:00,091 --> 00:21:01,325
God!

326
00:21:25,850 --> 00:21:28,286
What happens now?

327
00:21:50,341 --> 00:21:51,274
Bye.

328
00:21:51,342 --> 00:21:52,577
Bye, albert.

329
00:21:54,245 --> 00:21:56,112
Bon voyage.

330
00:21:56,180 --> 00:21:57,816
Albert!

331
00:21:57,882 --> 00:22:01,820
Don't you even want to say
good-Bye to your friends?

332
00:22:01,886 --> 00:22:03,321
No.

333
00:22:03,387 --> 00:22:04,822
Bye-Bye,
albert!

334
00:22:04,890 --> 00:22:06,825
Albert, bye-Bye.

335
00:22:06,892 --> 00:22:08,493
Au revoir!

336
00:22:08,560 --> 00:22:10,895

Yes, ma'am.

346
00:22:37,889 --> 00:22:40,425
You traveled
all alone before?

347
00:22:41,826 --> 00:22:43,228
No.

348
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:45,763
My name is florence.
What's yours?

349
00:22:45,830 --> 00:22:47,499
Albert.

350
00:22:47,566 --> 00:22:49,601
Are you named

351
00:22:51,135 --> 00:22:53,371
Frank sinatra.

352
00:22:53,437 --> 00:22:55,840
Well, aren't you special!

353
00:22:55,906 --> 00:22:59,977
Do your mom and dad listen
to his records all the time?

354
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,246
My mom was his friend.

355
00:23:02,313 --> 00:23:04,182
Oh, that must
have been nice.

356
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:05,816
What about your daddy?

357
00:23:05,883 --> 00:23:08,420
He's...

358
00:23:11,089 --> 00:23:12,657
Dead.

359
00:23:12,723 --> 00:23:14,024
Oh.

360
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:17,095
I'm sorry.

361
00:23:18,797 --> 00:23:25,704
Well, i have some crayons
here and a game book...

362
00:23:28,439 --> 00:23:31,575
And i'll
bring you a snack,

363
00:23:31,642 --> 00:23:35,046
And after that we'll do
lunch and a movie.

364
00:23:35,113 --> 00:23:36,782
Ok, albert?

365
00:23:56,100 --> 00:23:57,535
Merci.

366
00:23:59,003 --> 00:23:59,937
Huh?

367
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,607
I said, merci.

368
00:24:03,908 --> 00:24:06,477
Je vous en prie.

369
00:24:06,544 --> 00:24:07,778
What, son?

370
00:24:07,845 --> 00:24:09,481
Nothing.

371
00:24:12,717 --> 00:24:14,485
Tu parles francais?

372
00:24:14,552 --> 00:24:17,722
Mr. Antoine taught me

373
00:24:17,789 --> 00:24:21,125

And merde!

376
00:24:24,496 --> 00:24:26,130
You know those?

377
00:24:26,197 --> 00:24:27,998
You talking
to me, son?

378
00:24:28,066 --> 00:24:29,167
Uh-Uh.

379
00:24:30,902 --> 00:24:34,506
I wonder,
could you make it a little bigger, my nose?

380
00:24:35,340 --> 00:24:36,640
Sure.

381
00:24:36,708 --> 00:24:38,443
Bigger. Bigger.
More bigger.

382
00:24:38,510 --> 00:24:40,144
Don't be afraid.

383
00:24:40,211 --> 00:24:42,446
Is very big nose.

384
00:24:42,513 --> 00:24:44,148
What do you think?

385
00:24:44,215 --> 00:24:45,583
Maybe more hair,
huh?

386
00:24:47,018 --> 00:24:48,553
Sure.

387
00:24:49,553 --> 00:24:52,156
More. Oh, yes,
more, more, more!

388
00:24:52,223 --> 00:24:54,024
Good, good, good!

389
00:24:56,093 --> 00:24:57,329
Big eyes.

390
00:24:57,395 --> 00:24:59,964
Bigger eyes, eh?

391
00:25:00,031 --> 00:25:01,899
Good!

392
00:25:01,967 --> 00:25:04,469
Good.
Merci beaucoup.

393
00:25:04,535 --> 00:25:06,471
Do you want glasses?

394
00:25:06,538 --> 00:25:08,139
It's ok.
I have contacts.

395
00:25:10,075 --> 00:25:11,275
What is it, son?

396
00:25:11,342 --> 00:25:13,044
Nothing.

397
00:25:14,345 --> 00:25:16,748
Ooh, she's fish-Face.

398
00:25:16,815 --> 00:25:20,051
Hello, fish-Face, eh?

399
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,721
I know.

400
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:27,024
Oh, she scares me.

401
00:25:27,091 --> 00:25:28,592
Come on, let's go.

402
00:25:34,933 --> 00:25:36,167
Excuse me.

403
00:25:36,234 --> 00:25:37,702
Mm-Hmm.

404
00:26:31,322 --> 00:26:33,056
Hello.

405
00:26:33,124 --> 00:26:34,692
Hello.

406
00:26:34,759 --> 00:26:37,094
Could i come out,
please?

407
00:26:37,161 --> 00:26:39,197
Sure.

408
00:26:46,170 --> 00:26:47,071
Ow!

409
00:26:47,137 --> 00:26:49,107
Wow!

410
00:26:49,173 --> 00:26:50,942
You're so big.

411
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,078
I am big.

412
00:26:54,145 --> 00:26:58,081
I am stupendous,
colossal, amazing,

413
00:26:58,149 --> 00:27:03,087
Fantastic, magnificent,
exceptional.

414
00:27:03,154 --> 00:27:05,089
I am...

415
00:27:05,156 --> 00:27:07,191
Bogus.

416
00:27:07,258 --> 00:27:09,293
I'm albert.

417
00:27:09,360 --> 00:27:11,094
Albert.

418
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,797
Hmm, albert.

419
00:27:15,165 --> 00:27:16,601
Hmm.

420
00:27:16,667 --> 00:27:18,602
Why are you crying?

421
00:27:18,669 --> 00:27:20,672
I miss my mom.

422
00:27:22,506 --> 00:27:26,577
Mom. Oh, mom.

423
00:27:26,644 --> 00:27:30,448
Is very important
thing to have mom.

424
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:33,117
Now you have a godmom.

425
00:27:33,183 --> 00:27:36,320
Very important thing
to have a godmom.

426
00:27:36,387 --> 00:27:38,389
I don't want a godmom.

427
00:27:38,456 --> 00:27:42,126
Why not? Maybe you will
like what you see, hmm?

428
00:27:42,193 --> 00:27:44,629
Maybe she...

429
00:27:44,695 --> 00:27:47,331
She will be amazing,

430
00:27:47,398 --> 00:27:49,433
Maybe...spectacular.

431
00:27:49,500 --> 00:27:51,469
Maybe stupendous!

432
00:27:51,536 --> 00:27:52,803
Colossal?

433
00:27:52,870 --> 00:27:54,671
Maybe magnificent!

434
00:27:54,739 --> 00:27:56,340
Maybe unbelievable!

435
00:27:56,407 --> 00:27:58,375
Bravo! Yes!
Unbelievable!

436
00:27:58,442 --> 00:28:02,346
Maybe she's the world's
greatest godmom!

437
00:28:02,413 --> 00:28:04,348
What did he say?

438
00:28:04,415 --> 00:28:05,716
What's going on?

439
00:28:19,263 --> 00:28:21,165
Excuse me.

440
00:28:21,232 --> 00:28:22,734
Excuse me.

441
00:28:27,738 --> 00:28:30,408
The flight from
las vegas...Is it in?

442
00:28:30,474 --> 00:28:31,675
Landed 20 minutes ago.

443
00:28:31,742 --> 00:28:33,478
I'm looking
for a little boy.

444
00:28:33,545 --> 00:28:35,346
Wait, wait. Are you
miss harriet franklin?

445
00:28:35,412 --> 00:28:37,081
Yes.

446
00:28:37,148 --> 00:28:39,716
The boy's waiting down at traveller's aid,
down level one.

447
00:28:39,783 --> 00:28:41,385
Take the escalator,
turn right.

448
00:28:41,452 --> 00:28:42,787
Ok. Escalator,
turn right.

449
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:07,678
You wouldn't be
miss franklin?

450
00:29:07,745 --> 00:29:09,414
Actually,
i would be.

451
00:29:09,481 --> 00:29:11,750
Oh.

452
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:15,585
I'm sorry I'm late.

453
00:29:15,653 --> 00:29:18,055
The jackson street bridge was out,
and i couldn't get across.

454
00:29:18,122 --> 00:29:19,724
Yes, I'm sure
that's true.

455
00:29:19,791 --> 00:29:22,293
Well, we have to give ourselves
a little more time these days,

456
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,228
Especially when picking up
such precious cargo.

457
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:28,633
I'll need to see some
identification, please.

458
00:29:28,700 --> 00:29:30,134
I'm sorry.

459
00:29:30,201 --> 00:29:32,804
Passport, driver's lic...
Thank you.

460
00:29:36,908 --> 00:29:40,043
Boy, do you look
like your mother.

461
00:29:43,547 --> 00:29:46,584
I.D. Is fine.
You have to sign right there.

462
00:29:46,651 --> 00:29:47,852
Great.

463
00:29:47,918 --> 00:29:49,152
Are you
a card player?

464
00:29:49,220 --> 00:29:50,855
Oh, no.
He's a magician.

465
00:29:50,922 --> 00:29:53,190
He can make
the ace of spades

466
00:29:53,257 --> 00:29:55,760
Turn into
the queen of hearts.

467
00:29:55,827 --> 00:29:57,695
Looks like
he's on sale.

468
00:29:57,761 --> 00:29:59,663
Can i take
the tag off?

469
00:29:59,730 --> 00:30:03,835
Usually the tag's taken off at
the gate when they're picked up.

470
00:30:03,901 --> 00:30:05,702
I said i was sorry.

471
00:30:05,769 --> 00:30:07,238
Mm-Hmm.

472
00:30:08,238 --> 00:30:11,943
Ok. Let me get
your tag off here.

473
00:30:15,780 --> 00:30:16,714
Sorry.

474
00:30:16,780 --> 00:30:17,815
There you go.

475
00:30:17,881 --> 00:30:19,049
Thank you.

476
00:30:19,116 --> 00:30:21,352
So get your backpack
and...

477
00:30:22,786 --> 00:30:23,887
We'll go.

478
00:30:23,954 --> 00:30:25,690
What's
in the parcel?

479
00:30:25,757 --> 00:30:27,291
My pillow.

480
00:30:27,358 --> 00:30:28,893
Oh.

481
00:30:28,959 --> 00:30:31,729
Ok. Let's go.

482
00:30:31,796 --> 00:30:33,631
Good luck, Albert.

483
00:30:33,698 --> 00:30:35,533
That's it. No more
shortcuts for me.

484
00:30:35,600 --> 00:30:37,901
I know better.
You know, there's no shortcuts in life.

485
00:30:37,968 --> 00:30:39,704
I'm sure you know that.
I know that.

486
00:30:39,770 --> 00:30:42,239
It's the kind of thing where
you just have to concentrate.

487
00:30:42,306 --> 00:30:44,107
Because i don't
know how i got here.

488
00:30:44,174 --> 00:30:45,908
I'm not sure
i am here.

489
00:30:45,976 --> 00:30:47,912
You know what?
I don't think I'm here.

490
00:30:47,979 --> 00:30:49,881
As a matter of fact,
i think I'm not really here.

491
00:30:49,947 --> 00:30:51,916
As a matter of fact,

492
00:30:51,983 --> 00:30:54,118
I am an alien
space monster,

493
00:30:54,185 --> 00:30:56,919
And I'm going to
eat you up!

494
00:30:58,755 --> 00:31:00,057
Aah!

495
00:31:00,124 --> 00:31:01,492
What's the matter?

496
00:31:01,559 --> 00:31:02,726
My coloring book.

497
00:31:02,793 --> 00:31:03,760
What about it?

498
00:31:03,827 --> 00:31:05,162
I left it
on the airplane.

499
00:31:05,229 --> 00:31:06,363
We'll get you
another one.

500
00:31:06,430 --> 00:31:07,765
I need that one!

501
00:31:07,832 --> 00:31:09,801
Hey, I'm going to
get towed away!

502
00:31:09,867 --> 00:31:13,904
Flight 106 from st. Louis
now arriving at gate 61.

503
00:31:19,610 --> 00:31:21,410
Never mind.

504
00:31:21,478 --> 00:31:23,548
It's ok.

505
00:31:23,614 --> 00:31:24,949
We can go now.

506
00:31:25,016 --> 00:31:27,284
Oh, well,
I'm relieved,

507
00:31:27,351 --> 00:31:29,253
Because we weren't going
back to get a coloring book.

508
00:31:29,320 --> 00:31:31,455
It's all right.
She's nervous.

509
00:31:31,522 --> 00:31:32,956
She's a space monster.

510
00:31:33,024 --> 00:31:34,457
She has
funny hair, huh?

511
00:31:34,525 --> 00:31:35,459
I know.

512
00:31:35,526 --> 00:31:36,794
You know
what?

513
00:31:36,860 --> 00:31:37,661
I don't know.

514
00:31:37,728 --> 00:31:38,930
Oh.

515
00:31:40,331 --> 00:31:41,966
Hey! What are
you doing?

516
00:31:42,033 --> 00:31:43,266
Don't write
that ticket, man.

517
00:31:43,333 --> 00:31:45,469
I had to pick up
the little boy.

518
00:31:45,536 --> 00:31:47,972
He was traveling by himself
in traveller's aid.

519
00:31:48,038 --> 00:31:49,440
Don't you have kids?

520
00:31:49,506 --> 00:31:51,476
No.

521
00:31:53,044 --> 00:31:54,979
Well, listen.
It wasn't that long.

522
00:31:55,046 --> 00:31:58,149
I wasn't here
but 3 minutes.

523
00:31:58,215 --> 00:31:59,249
15.

524
00:31:59,316 --> 00:32:00,985
I was not here
15 minutes.

525
00:32:01,051 --> 00:32:02,986
I would know if
i was here 15 minutes.

526
00:32:03,054 --> 00:32:04,121
Get in the car.

527
00:32:04,188 --> 00:32:05,990
If i was here
15 minutes,

528
00:32:06,056 --> 00:32:08,025
I would not be
fooling around with you.

529
00:32:08,092 --> 00:32:10,161
What are you doing?
Get in!

530
00:32:10,227 --> 00:32:12,830
I wasn't here 15 minutes.
I was here 3 minutes.

531
00:32:12,897 --> 00:32:14,498
Why are you
writing a ticket?

532
00:32:14,565 --> 00:32:17,068
I'm not paying it,
I'm just telling you now.

533
00:32:18,369 --> 00:32:21,072
Don't pay it, lady.
Pay your lawyer.

534
00:32:32,583 --> 00:32:36,020
Do you believe that guy had
the nerve to give me a ticket?

535
00:32:36,087 --> 00:32:37,821
I mean, there's
drug addicts out there,

536
00:32:37,888 --> 00:32:40,323
There's crazy people starting fires,
running around naked,

537
00:32:40,391 --> 00:32:41,792
And what
is this guy doing...

538
00:32:41,859 --> 00:32:44,928
The police department,
our fabulous police department?

539
00:32:44,995 --> 00:32:46,229
Giving me a ticket.

540
00:32:46,297 --> 00:32:48,232
I work every day.
I pay rent.

541
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:50,267
I could have
been picking up

542
00:32:50,334 --> 00:32:51,702
A loved one
or something.

543
00:32:51,769 --> 00:32:53,170
Oh, loved one.

544
00:32:53,237 --> 00:32:54,572
That sounds good.

545
00:32:56,273 --> 00:32:59,042
Well, can't cry
about it.

546
00:32:59,109 --> 00:33:02,044
Cannot
cry about it.

547
00:33:02,112 --> 00:33:05,583
So...you play
cards, huh?

548
00:33:05,650 --> 00:33:07,551
He does magic.

549
00:33:07,618 --> 00:33:09,687
I do magic.

550
00:33:09,754 --> 00:33:11,554
You do magic,
huh? Good.

551
00:33:11,622 --> 00:33:14,858
Yes, yes. You do
the french pass.

552
00:33:14,925 --> 00:33:16,627
I know.

553
00:33:16,693 --> 00:33:18,962
You know what?

554
00:33:19,029 --> 00:33:21,265
Nothing.

555
00:33:21,331 --> 00:33:24,067
Why do you keep
saying "i know"?

556
00:33:24,134 --> 00:33:26,570
Tell her
you are thinking.

557
00:33:26,637 --> 00:33:28,572
I was thinking.

558
00:33:28,639 --> 00:33:31,574
Oh, good.
That's something we can do together...Think.

559
00:33:31,642 --> 00:33:33,778
Think.

560
00:34:23,193 --> 00:34:24,428
This is it.

561
00:34:24,495 --> 00:34:26,630
277 barrow.
That's where we live.

562
00:34:26,697 --> 00:34:28,466
Can you
remember that?

563
00:34:28,532 --> 00:34:29,967
277.

564
00:34:30,034 --> 00:34:31,369
Yeah.

565
00:34:35,239 --> 00:34:36,940
Now, listen, uh...

566
00:34:37,007 --> 00:34:38,642
277 barrow?

567
00:34:38,708 --> 00:34:39,442
Yeah.

568
00:34:39,510 --> 00:34:41,145
I've always
lived alone,

569
00:34:41,212 --> 00:34:44,214
So we're going to have to have some rules,
ok?

570
00:34:44,281 --> 00:34:45,983
You ok with rules?

571
00:34:46,050 --> 00:34:47,485
Sometimes.

572
00:34:50,521 --> 00:34:53,157
Do you have to go
to the bathroom?

573
00:34:53,223 --> 00:34:54,858
Because if you do,
it's down the hall.

574
00:34:54,925 --> 00:34:56,661
Now, i've only got one,

575
00:34:56,726 --> 00:34:59,596
So we're going to have to
figure out what we want to do.

576
00:34:59,664 --> 00:35:03,500
I don't want you to leave toothpaste
in the sink because it's really nasty.

577
00:35:03,567 --> 00:35:05,669
I'll try not to do
the same thing.

578
00:35:05,736 --> 00:35:07,672
The other thing is i would
really appreciate it

579
00:35:07,738 --> 00:35:10,640
If you would put down
the toilet seat because...

580
00:35:10,708 --> 00:35:13,177
Well, it's just because
it's courteous.

581
00:35:15,613 --> 00:35:20,451
Oh. I gave the mets a pretty
good deal on some coffee mugs,

582
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:22,353
So they gave me
a baseball.

583
00:35:23,720 --> 00:35:27,125
I have a baseball
signed by liza minelli.

584
00:35:28,191 --> 00:35:31,127
Why would liza minelli
sign a baseball?

585
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,063
The sahara hotel
was playing

586
00:35:33,130 --> 00:35:35,199
The hilton hotel
on sunday.

587
00:35:35,265 --> 00:35:37,535
My mom took me,
and mr. Antoine

588
00:35:37,601 --> 00:35:40,871
Got liza minelli
to sign a ball.

589
00:35:40,938 --> 00:35:45,710
It says, "to my favorite all-Star,
from liza minelli."

590
00:35:45,776 --> 00:35:48,913
Engelbert humperdinck hit
a home run in that game.

591
00:35:51,081 --> 00:35:55,219
Well, you know,
i don't really get engelbert humperdinck.

592
00:35:55,286 --> 00:35:58,155
He's nice.
Picked me up once.

593
00:35:58,222 --> 00:36:00,625
He's strong.

594
00:36:02,426 --> 00:36:06,730
♪ please release me ♪

595
00:36:06,797 --> 00:36:12,236
♪ let me go ♪

596
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:13,904
Are you hungry?

597
00:36:13,970 --> 00:36:15,640
No.

598
00:36:15,706 --> 00:36:17,742
Well, you have to
eat something.

599
00:36:17,808 --> 00:36:19,076
Come in here.

600
00:36:19,142 --> 00:36:21,212
I got us a couple
of tv dinners.

601
00:36:23,314 --> 00:36:25,249
What kind?

602
00:36:25,315 --> 00:36:27,250
Fish cakes.

603
00:36:27,317 --> 00:36:28,920
Fish cakes?
Oh, no.

604
00:36:28,986 --> 00:36:31,923
You like fish, don't you?
It's like brain food.

605
00:36:33,824 --> 00:36:37,528
We like nachos.

606
00:36:37,595 --> 00:36:40,129
Well, we don't
have no nachos.

607
00:36:40,197 --> 00:36:41,965
We have fish cakes.

608
00:36:42,032 --> 00:36:45,402
We have fish cakes with
cauliflower and brownies.

609
00:36:45,469 --> 00:36:47,604
That's what we have.

610
00:36:47,671 --> 00:36:50,140
Here are the plates,
and here are the cups.

611
00:36:50,207 --> 00:36:51,575
Styrofoam?!

612
00:36:51,642 --> 00:36:54,678
They're not
biodegradable.

613
00:36:54,745 --> 00:36:57,915
That's too bad,
because i got 2,500 of them.

614
00:36:57,982 --> 00:37:01,652
They're all misprinted,
so i got stuck with them.

615
00:37:01,719 --> 00:37:04,621
I think it's too early
to talk about biodegradable.

616
00:37:04,688 --> 00:37:06,122
No, no.

617
00:37:06,189 --> 00:37:08,158
She's a polluter.

618
00:37:08,225 --> 00:37:10,093
What?

619
00:37:10,160 --> 00:37:12,495
Nothing.

620
00:37:14,498 --> 00:37:17,235
Why don't i show you
your room?

621
00:37:22,740 --> 00:37:24,274
I want to go home.

622
00:37:24,341 --> 00:37:26,143
She's nervous.

623
00:37:26,209 --> 00:37:27,444
She scares me.

624
00:37:27,511 --> 00:37:29,880
I'll stay by your side
like krazy glue.

625
00:37:29,947 --> 00:37:31,515
Promise?

626
00:37:33,517 --> 00:37:35,453
I never break
a promise.

627
00:37:35,519 --> 00:37:37,654
Who are you talking to?

628
00:37:37,721 --> 00:37:38,723
Nobody.

629
00:37:42,726 --> 00:37:44,194
Mumbling all the time.

630
00:37:44,261 --> 00:37:46,497
I don't know what
you're talking about.

631
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,165
You notice i got you
your own television set,

632
00:37:49,232 --> 00:37:51,334
And if you look
out the window,

633
00:37:51,401 --> 00:37:52,803
You'll see
there's a park.

634
00:37:52,870 --> 00:37:54,805
In the park,
there's a playground.

635
00:37:54,871 --> 00:37:57,675
If anybody says
anything to you, run.

636
00:37:57,742 --> 00:38:00,611
Now, we're looking into
boys' clubs and ys for you

637
00:38:00,678 --> 00:38:02,879
Because I'm going to be
working all the time.

638
00:38:02,946 --> 00:38:05,682
I don't have time to
spend with you, you know,

639
00:38:05,749 --> 00:38:07,750
Because I'm trying
to expand my business.

640
00:38:07,818 --> 00:38:10,921
I'm actually trying
to buy a warehouse supply.

641
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:15,993
Yeah, well...

642
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:20,030
We're looking into
summer camps for you, too.

643
00:38:20,097 --> 00:38:21,365
You like summer camp?

644
00:38:21,431 --> 00:38:23,466
My mom took me places
in the summer.

645
00:38:23,533 --> 00:38:26,770
Oh. Well,
i can't do that

646
00:38:26,837 --> 00:38:30,074
Because, obviously,
i have a business to run.

647
00:38:32,509 --> 00:38:34,945
Cupboard's over there.
Bathroom's down the hall.

648
00:38:35,012 --> 00:38:38,382
I put some little mickey
mouse soaps in there for you.

649
00:38:38,449 --> 00:38:41,418
Want to take a bath?
I'll go run you a bath.

650
00:38:41,484 --> 00:38:43,220
I'll run you a bath.

651
00:38:43,287 --> 00:38:46,790
Oh, and don't mess
with the fire escape.

652
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:48,024
It's off-Limits.

653
00:38:49,893 --> 00:38:53,197
You know, i heard
you're good in school.

654
00:38:53,263 --> 00:38:55,031
Do you like school?

655
00:38:55,099 --> 00:38:56,600
I guess so.

656
00:39:01,605 --> 00:39:05,242
So...you miss
everybody, huh?

657
00:39:05,309 --> 00:39:07,043
Your mom and...

658
00:39:07,110 --> 00:39:08,812
Say yes.

659
00:39:08,878 --> 00:39:11,115
Yes.

660
00:39:14,952 --> 00:39:18,556
Well, you're just going to have to...
deal with it.

661
00:39:18,622 --> 00:39:21,457
You know,
you got to get strong.

662
00:39:21,525 --> 00:39:23,560
Got to learn
to grow up.

663
00:39:23,627 --> 00:39:26,397
You don't always
get choices in life.

664
00:39:26,463 --> 00:39:28,565
Your mom had to do it.
I had to do it.

665
00:39:28,632 --> 00:39:30,134
We had to grow up.

666
00:39:33,270 --> 00:39:34,972
We grew up.

667
00:39:37,641 --> 00:39:39,944
Your mom was
my best friend.

668
00:39:40,010 --> 00:39:41,712
She was my real pal.

669
00:39:48,852 --> 00:39:51,654
You can put your things
away, can't you?

670
00:39:52,956 --> 00:39:54,791
He wants you to tell
him a big hello.

671
00:39:54,858 --> 00:39:58,395
He wants you to tell
him you like his face.

672
00:39:58,462 --> 00:40:00,297
Why don't you
pick him up

673
00:40:00,363 --> 00:40:02,866
And give a big, big
kiss on his face?

674
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,335
I don't want her
to pick me up.

675
00:40:05,402 --> 00:40:08,171
Oh, yes,
you do. Ooh!

676
00:40:08,238 --> 00:40:09,440
No, i don't.

677
00:40:11,341 --> 00:40:13,143
Oh, you cry?

678
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,878
Cry.
Is good to cry.

679
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,880
I won't cry!
I won't watch tv,

680
00:40:16,947 --> 00:40:19,116
And i won't go
to summer camp,

681
00:40:19,182 --> 00:40:22,153
And i won't wash my
hands with mickey mouse.

682
00:40:22,219 --> 00:40:23,186
Maybe minnie?

683
00:40:23,253 --> 00:40:24,121
No.

684
00:40:24,188 --> 00:40:25,622
Goofy?

685
00:40:25,689 --> 00:40:27,324
No. I want
to go home!

686
00:40:27,390 --> 00:40:28,357
But you have
no ticket.

687
00:40:28,425 --> 00:40:30,094
I have
my own money.

688
00:40:30,160 --> 00:40:33,830
It's all here.
I can use it for whatever i want to.

689
00:40:33,897 --> 00:40:37,567
I have my own insurance policy
that my mother left me.

690
00:40:37,635 --> 00:40:39,636
I'm going to be
really rich.

691
00:40:39,703 --> 00:40:41,971
It's for college,
you know?

692
00:40:42,039 --> 00:40:44,641
She doesn't know
anything about baseball.

693
00:40:44,708 --> 00:40:46,643
All she does is
talk about newark.

694
00:40:46,710 --> 00:40:49,179
I hate newark.
I hate it!

695
00:40:49,246 --> 00:40:53,851
She...She...She wants...
she needs a friend, huh?

696
00:40:53,918 --> 00:40:55,352
You should try.

697
00:40:55,418 --> 00:40:56,853
I don't want to try.

698
00:40:56,920 --> 00:40:58,021
Yes, you do.

699
00:40:58,088 --> 00:40:59,022
No, i don't!

700
00:40:59,089 --> 00:40:59,956
Yes, you do.

701
00:41:00,023 --> 00:41:01,191
No, i don't!

702
00:41:01,258 --> 00:41:02,058
Ye...

703
00:41:27,751 --> 00:41:30,387
I want to go back
to vegas.

704
00:41:30,453 --> 00:41:32,690
I don't
like it here.

705
00:41:32,756 --> 00:41:34,257
I don't want to try.

706
00:41:34,324 --> 00:41:35,625
Albert?

707
00:41:35,692 --> 00:41:37,895
Your bath's ready.

708
00:41:39,997 --> 00:41:42,732
Albert, let's go.

709
00:41:51,976 --> 00:41:53,644
It's down here.

710
00:41:58,448 --> 00:42:00,150
I ran a tub for you.

711
00:42:00,216 --> 00:42:03,420
I don't know how you like it,
so maybe it's too hot.

712
00:42:03,487 --> 00:42:05,422
You'll get in
and let me know.

713
00:42:05,489 --> 00:42:08,425
I put some of this in.
It's big bird.

714
00:42:08,491 --> 00:42:10,194
So...it's all ready.

715
00:42:14,798 --> 00:42:17,267
Do you need me
to take your cl...

716
00:42:17,334 --> 00:42:19,703
I can wash myself.

717
00:42:19,770 --> 00:42:22,940
Oh! Great. I'm going
to fix dinner.

718
00:42:31,615 --> 00:42:34,250
I can't live here.

719
00:42:34,317 --> 00:42:36,753
If i live here,
i'll die.

720
00:42:36,820 --> 00:42:40,090
You cannot die.
You just got here.

721
00:42:40,156 --> 00:42:41,792
Besides, if you die,

722
00:42:41,859 --> 00:42:44,060
What will you do
tomorrow?

723
00:42:44,127 --> 00:42:47,529
What will i do?
I could lose my job.

724
00:42:47,597 --> 00:42:52,235
If you die, I'm back waiting for
someone to make me up again.

725
00:42:52,302 --> 00:42:54,271
Back where?

726
00:42:54,337 --> 00:42:57,274
Back where
i come from.

727
00:42:57,340 --> 00:42:58,675
Where's that?

728
00:42:58,742 --> 00:43:02,079
That is where i am
before you make me up.

729
00:43:02,145 --> 00:43:03,681
Hmm?

730
00:43:06,350 --> 00:43:08,585
Before i drew
your picture?

731
00:43:08,652 --> 00:43:10,854
Are there
other people there?

732
00:43:10,920 --> 00:43:13,290
Ooh!

733
00:43:13,357 --> 00:43:16,360
Ooh. Everybody
you can imagine.

734
00:43:16,426 --> 00:43:18,696
My mother?

735
00:43:18,762 --> 00:43:21,598
You should wash
behind the ears.

736
00:43:21,665 --> 00:43:23,500
I want to go home.

737
00:43:23,566 --> 00:43:25,602
I don't
like it here.

738
00:43:25,669 --> 00:43:28,372
I want to see
my mother.

739
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:30,307
Albert...

740
00:43:30,373 --> 00:43:32,609
Your mother is dead.

741
00:43:32,676 --> 00:43:34,611
I hate that word!

742
00:43:34,678 --> 00:43:36,680
I want to go
to where you live.

743
00:43:36,746 --> 00:43:38,615
This is where
i live, you know?

744
00:43:38,682 --> 00:43:39,783
Here it is.

745
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:41,484
Where...Where you live,
i live.

746
00:43:41,551 --> 00:43:43,153
This is not
where i live.

747
00:43:43,219 --> 00:43:44,020
Is!

748
00:43:44,087 --> 00:43:45,022
Isn't!

749
00:43:45,088 --> 00:43:46,022
Is!

750
00:43:46,089 --> 00:43:50,126
Isn't!

751
00:43:50,193 --> 00:43:52,296
Albert, are you
all right in there?

752
00:43:52,362 --> 00:43:53,496
Huh?

753
00:43:53,563 --> 00:43:55,131
Say yes.

754
00:43:55,198 --> 00:43:56,866
Yeah.

755
00:43:56,934 --> 00:44:00,337
Great. Well, hurry up.
Dinner's almost ready.

756
00:44:03,706 --> 00:44:05,642
She's hungry.

757
00:44:05,709 --> 00:44:08,212
Ha ha ha!

758
00:44:18,722 --> 00:44:21,358
Albert,
dinner's ready.

759
00:44:21,425 --> 00:44:22,659
I'm not hungry.

760
00:44:22,726 --> 00:44:25,361
Well, come on.
It turned out great.

761
00:44:25,428 --> 00:44:26,663
I don't want any.

762
00:44:26,730 --> 00:44:28,665
Come on. You got
to eat something.

763
00:44:28,732 --> 00:44:30,166
I don't want any!

764
00:44:30,233 --> 00:44:31,735
Fine. Fine.

765
00:44:46,016 --> 00:44:47,951
Albert?

766
00:44:48,018 --> 00:44:52,189
Albert, i made you
a sandwich.

767
00:45:41,071 --> 00:45:42,839
This must be harriet.

768
00:45:42,906 --> 00:45:45,341
This is mrs. Franklin,
harriet...Your foster mother.

769
00:45:45,408 --> 00:45:46,509
Hi.

770
00:45:46,576 --> 00:45:48,077
This is your new home.

771
00:45:48,144 --> 00:45:49,379
Come in.

772
00:45:52,081 --> 00:45:54,251
This is harriet,
everybody.

773
00:45:54,318 --> 00:45:55,919
This is mr. Franklin,

774
00:45:55,986 --> 00:45:58,188
Richard, david.

775
00:45:58,255 --> 00:45:59,322
Hello, harriet.

776
00:45:59,389 --> 00:46:01,357
And this is lorraine.

777
00:46:01,424 --> 00:46:05,228
Hi.

778
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,030
You're going to
sleep in my room,

779
00:46:07,097 --> 00:46:09,767
And we can be
best friends.

780
00:46:41,731 --> 00:46:44,568
Albert, are you hungry?

781
00:46:44,634 --> 00:46:47,204
What's
in the sandwich?

782
00:46:52,175 --> 00:46:53,143
Oh!

783
00:46:54,644 --> 00:46:57,481
Peanuts.
Peanuts butter.

784
00:47:01,517 --> 00:47:05,422
No, thank you.

785
00:47:31,682 --> 00:47:33,116
Slow down!

786
00:47:33,182 --> 00:47:36,319
Slow down! No running
in the hallways.

787
00:47:36,386 --> 00:47:38,121
You know the rules.

788
00:47:38,187 --> 00:47:41,124
Ok, ms. Franklin.
I'll take albert to his class.

789
00:47:41,191 --> 00:47:43,827
You can pick him up at 2:45.
Say good-Bye, albert.

790
00:47:43,893 --> 00:47:45,528
Bye.

791
00:47:45,595 --> 00:47:47,129
Listen to
your teachers...

792
00:47:47,197 --> 00:47:49,132
And don't get
into trouble.

793
00:47:49,198 --> 00:47:52,502
I'll be on the steps
at 2:45. Be there.

794
00:47:57,039 --> 00:47:59,176
You hear
what she said?

795
00:47:59,242 --> 00:48:00,510
Yes.

796
00:48:25,368 --> 00:48:28,004
All right.
I'm going to have to call you back.

797
00:48:28,070 --> 00:48:29,172
Good morning,
harriet.

798
00:48:29,239 --> 00:48:30,673
What,
don't i exist?

799
00:48:30,740 --> 00:48:32,674
Good morning,
harriet. So?

800
00:48:32,742 --> 00:48:34,478
How is he?
What's he like?

801
00:48:34,544 --> 00:48:37,881
I don't know.
He's like a little boy.

802
00:48:37,948 --> 00:48:40,383
Does he like his room?
Did you feed him?

803
00:48:40,450 --> 00:48:42,317
He wasn't hungry.
He doesn't like styrofoam cups

804
00:48:42,385 --> 00:48:43,786
Because they're
not biodegradable.

805
00:48:43,853 --> 00:48:46,189
Of course not.
He's a kid.

806
00:48:46,256 --> 00:48:48,191
He's got
convictions.

807
00:48:48,257 --> 00:48:51,694
So? What did
you guys talk about?

808
00:48:51,761 --> 00:48:53,997
What did
he have to say?

809
00:48:54,064 --> 00:48:57,200
He didn't say much of anything to me.
He talked to his friend.

810
00:48:57,266 --> 00:48:59,402
The child is
obviously not alone.

811
00:48:59,469 --> 00:49:01,204
He's got a friend?

812
00:49:01,271 --> 00:49:02,539
Mm-Hmm.

813
00:49:02,605 --> 00:49:04,540
And i can't tell you
anything about him

814
00:49:04,607 --> 00:49:06,276
Because he's invisible
and i can't see him.

815
00:49:06,343 --> 00:49:09,912
I had a little friend
when i was growing up.

816
00:49:09,979 --> 00:49:11,848
Little bitty thing.

817
00:49:11,915 --> 00:49:14,350
Can't remember her name,

818
00:49:14,417 --> 00:49:19,356
But she lived in my ear,
and she wore a tuxedo,

819
00:49:19,422 --> 00:49:23,860
And she whispered things
to me i never knew about.

820
00:49:23,927 --> 00:49:26,296
She made me feel safe.

821
00:49:26,362 --> 00:49:29,433
I couldn't have
survived without her.

822
00:49:29,499 --> 00:49:31,366
Drudella.

823
00:49:31,434 --> 00:49:32,902
Yeah.

824
00:49:32,969 --> 00:49:35,038
That was her name.

825
00:49:38,075 --> 00:49:39,408
Excuse me!

826
00:49:39,476 --> 00:49:42,512
Do i have
any appointments today?

827
00:49:42,579 --> 00:49:45,882
You can see the hudson
brothers at 10:00.

828
00:49:45,949 --> 00:49:47,684
If you want
to drop in on springer,

829
00:49:47,751 --> 00:49:50,854
He's interested in the cocktail
glasses at the march 30th rate.

830
00:49:50,921 --> 00:49:52,388
Did bob morrison call?

831
00:49:52,455 --> 00:49:55,357
He just called.
He can meet you at the warehouse at 3:00.

832
00:49:55,425 --> 00:49:57,127
I have to pick up
albert at 2:45.

833
00:49:57,194 --> 00:49:59,029
You can make it.

834
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,896
I can't. You're going to
have to pick him up.

835
00:50:00,963 --> 00:50:02,031
I got the dentist
at 3:00.

836
00:50:02,098 --> 00:50:03,599
Take him with you.

837
00:50:03,666 --> 00:50:06,403
I'll pick up albert if
you have the root canal.

838
00:50:06,469 --> 00:50:09,672
No! See...i knew this
wasn't going to work out.

839
00:50:09,739 --> 00:50:11,408
This is not
going to work.

840
00:50:11,475 --> 00:50:13,776
I haven't had a
conversation with a child

841
00:50:13,843 --> 00:50:15,212
Since i was a child,

842
00:50:15,278 --> 00:50:17,214
And now i got one
sitting on the steps

843
00:50:17,280 --> 00:50:19,850
Waiting for me
to pick him up at 2:45.

844
00:50:36,499 --> 00:50:41,304
Goddamn!

845
00:50:52,015 --> 00:50:53,982
Maybe she's
not coming.

846
00:50:54,050 --> 00:50:55,451
Listen to him.

847
00:50:55,518 --> 00:50:56,653
She'll come.

848
00:50:58,187 --> 00:50:59,356
There's no one there.

849
00:50:59,422 --> 00:51:01,124
Maybe she'll never come.

850
00:51:01,190 --> 00:51:02,526
This kid's
really nuts.

851
00:51:02,592 --> 00:51:03,760
Let's go.

852
00:51:03,826 --> 00:51:05,095
She'll be mad.

853
00:51:05,161 --> 00:51:06,429
I don't care.

854
00:51:06,495 --> 00:51:08,298
Hey, weirdo,
where are you going?

855
00:51:08,364 --> 00:51:11,368
Hey, albert,
who you talking to?

856
00:51:12,835 --> 00:51:14,237
Come on.

857
00:51:14,304 --> 00:51:18,975
♪ me and my shadow ♪

858
00:51:19,042 --> 00:51:24,147
♪ strolling down the avenue ♪

859
00:51:24,214 --> 00:51:29,586
♪ me and my shadow ♪

860
00:51:29,652 --> 00:51:31,921
♪ i need a friend
to tell my troubles to ♪

861
00:51:31,988 --> 00:51:33,823
That's
a big truck.

862
00:51:42,065 --> 00:51:43,900
Look, look, look!

863
00:51:43,967 --> 00:51:45,535
Hey, fish face!

864
00:51:52,575 --> 00:51:53,475
Hey, look out!

865
00:51:53,543 --> 00:51:54,878
Watch out, kid.

866
00:51:56,413 --> 00:51:58,014
Why wasn't somebody
watching him?

867
00:51:58,081 --> 00:51:59,950
We can't watch them
every minute.

868
00:52:00,016 --> 00:52:01,818
We're doing the best
that we can.

869
00:52:01,884 --> 00:52:03,553
The parents got to assume
some responsibility, too.

870
00:52:03,620 --> 00:52:05,054
You were late.
You know that.

871
00:52:05,121 --> 00:52:07,023
What are you
telling me,

872
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:08,925
I'm irresponsible because i don't
control the traffic in newark?

873
00:52:08,992 --> 00:52:10,994
You should
have left earlier!

874
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,529
Hey, you 2 kids.

875
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:14,864
Did you see albert?
You know, the new student.

876
00:52:14,931 --> 00:52:16,198
Did you see him?

877
00:52:16,265 --> 00:52:17,700
He went back
to las vegas.

878
00:52:17,767 --> 00:52:19,035
Talking
to himself.

879
00:52:19,102 --> 00:52:20,502
You cover the streets
and the park.

880
00:52:20,570 --> 00:52:22,172
I'll check out
the yard here.

881
00:52:22,239 --> 00:52:24,040
Don't worry.
We'll find him.

882
00:52:24,106 --> 00:52:25,708
You 2 kids
go on home.

883
00:52:25,775 --> 00:52:27,109
Hey, lady!

884
00:52:27,176 --> 00:52:28,845
Your kid's weird.

885
00:52:32,549 --> 00:52:33,583
Come here.

886
00:52:35,619 --> 00:52:37,720
You want to see
something really weird?

887
00:52:37,787 --> 00:52:38,888
Sure.

888
00:52:38,955 --> 00:52:41,024
Go home and look
at your mothers!

889
00:52:41,090 --> 00:52:42,492
Aah!

890
00:53:13,890 --> 00:53:16,292
Yoo hoo!

891
00:53:18,460 --> 00:53:21,765
Eat lead,
mutant scum!

892
00:53:21,831 --> 00:53:23,633
Aah!

893
00:53:28,972 --> 00:53:31,808
I'm...dying!

894
00:53:31,874 --> 00:53:33,609
Huh!

895
00:53:46,822 --> 00:53:47,924
Aah!

896
00:53:47,990 --> 00:53:50,526
Aah! Ha ha ha!

897
00:53:52,329 --> 00:53:55,365
Whoo whoo whoo whoo!

898
00:53:57,867 --> 00:54:00,670
Aah!

899
00:54:02,038 --> 00:54:03,406
I got you!

900
00:54:41,610 --> 00:54:43,413
Aah!

901
00:54:55,624 --> 00:54:57,727
Aah!

902
00:55:05,067 --> 00:55:06,403
Albert.

903
00:55:08,037 --> 00:55:09,038
Albert!

904
00:55:10,539 --> 00:55:12,008
What are you doing?

905
00:55:12,074 --> 00:55:14,643
Do you know that everybody's
looking for you?

906
00:55:14,710 --> 00:55:15,645
Come on!

907
00:55:17,280 --> 00:55:19,048
What is the matter
with you?

908
00:55:19,115 --> 00:55:21,049
Do you know that the whole
school is looking for you?

909
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:23,019
And where are you?
Laying here in the park talking to yourself.

910
00:55:23,085 --> 00:55:25,254
You don't even know what
direction you're going.

911
00:55:25,321 --> 00:55:26,889
You live that way.

912
00:55:26,956 --> 00:55:28,958
Hey! Excuse me.
I was here looking for my lost son.

913
00:55:29,025 --> 00:55:30,426
Get in the car.

914
00:55:30,493 --> 00:55:32,362
He was lost. He's just
a little white boy,

915
00:55:32,428 --> 00:55:34,230
Doesn't know
where he's going.

916
00:55:34,296 --> 00:55:35,899
He's trying to
find his way home.

917
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,233
Aren't we all?

918
00:55:37,299 --> 00:55:38,534
No. We all are not.

919
00:55:38,601 --> 00:55:40,537
I know where i live.
I live that way.

920
00:55:40,603 --> 00:55:42,539
I've always known
where i lived.

921
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:44,540
Please, spare me
any kind of philosophy

922
00:55:44,607 --> 00:55:46,142
You getting ready
to throw.

923
00:55:46,209 --> 00:55:47,777
Hakuna matata.

924
00:55:52,615 --> 00:55:55,250
Disney cartoons
everywhere you turn.

925
00:55:55,318 --> 00:55:58,054
Disney,
disney, disney.

926
00:55:58,120 --> 00:56:01,458
People having conversations
with themselves.

927
00:56:01,524 --> 00:56:02,759
Like you.

928
00:56:02,826 --> 00:56:04,560
You know
how strange you look

929
00:56:04,627 --> 00:56:06,095
Having a conversation
by yourself?

930
00:56:06,162 --> 00:56:07,562
I have a theory
about that.

931
00:56:07,630 --> 00:56:09,598
If i can't see it,
it doesn't exist.

932
00:56:09,665 --> 00:56:12,000
That's because you
don't believe in magic.

933
00:56:12,067 --> 00:56:13,235
Yeah, well...

934
00:56:13,302 --> 00:56:14,771
I don't.

935
00:56:14,837 --> 00:56:16,272
You know why?

936
00:56:16,338 --> 00:56:18,007
Because when i was
a little kid,

937
00:56:18,074 --> 00:56:20,777
They used to have this show
on tv called peter pan.

938
00:56:20,843 --> 00:56:23,046
Had this grown woman in
it named mary martin

939
00:56:23,113 --> 00:56:24,513
Dressed up
like a little boy,

940
00:56:24,581 --> 00:56:26,583
Which i don't even
want to get into now.

941
00:56:26,649 --> 00:56:28,917
So this little fairy
gets sick, right?

942
00:56:28,985 --> 00:56:30,520
Tinkerbell.
She drinks the poison

943
00:56:30,587 --> 00:56:32,588
That captain hook
left for peter.

944
00:56:32,655 --> 00:56:34,757
Yeah. Whoever, whatever.

945
00:56:34,824 --> 00:56:37,193
Anyway, they said, "well,
if you believe in magic,

946
00:56:37,260 --> 00:56:40,730
"Why, then, you just clap your hands,
and she'll get better.

947
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:44,066
Yeah, if you believe, clap your hands, ooh!
She'll get better."

948
00:56:44,133 --> 00:56:45,868
Let me tell you
something:

949
00:56:45,935 --> 00:56:49,337
I didn't believe, so i didn't clap my hands,
and you know what?

950
00:56:49,405 --> 00:56:50,939
She got better anyway,

951
00:56:51,006 --> 00:56:55,044
Which just goes to show you
there is no such thing as magic.

952
00:56:55,111 --> 00:56:57,881
People just try to make
you believe that there is.

953
00:56:57,947 --> 00:57:00,550
I watched that video
with my mom.

954
00:57:00,617 --> 00:57:02,952
We always
clapped our hands.

955
00:57:05,988 --> 00:57:07,557
Yeah, well...

956
00:57:19,802 --> 00:57:21,737
Ha ha!
You can't believe...

957
00:57:21,804 --> 00:57:23,906
I got caught
in a detour.

958
00:57:23,973 --> 00:57:26,609
You know, they're
tearing up allen street.

959
00:57:26,675 --> 00:57:28,611
Come on, harriet.
Nobody takes allen street.

960
00:57:28,678 --> 00:57:30,746
You take rose,
and you cut across the 92.

961
00:57:30,813 --> 00:57:32,949
So you brought
your bodyguard, huh?

962
00:57:33,016 --> 00:57:34,416
Albert, mr. Morrison.

963
00:57:34,483 --> 00:57:35,819
Hi. Bob.

964
00:57:37,153 --> 00:57:38,421
Come on.

965
00:57:38,488 --> 00:57:40,656
I just want to
show you this.

966
00:57:50,366 --> 00:57:52,869
Isn't this great?
Isn't this spectacular?

967
00:57:52,936 --> 00:57:55,104
Isn't it everything i said
it was going to be?

968
00:57:55,171 --> 00:57:57,439
I mean, it's amazing.
Look at this place!

969
00:57:57,507 --> 00:57:59,409
And you know what's
wonderful about it?

970
00:57:59,475 --> 00:58:02,145
It has its own
2 trucks.

971
00:58:02,211 --> 00:58:05,413
Albert, don't break anything.
I don't own it yet.

972
00:58:05,481 --> 00:58:07,450
And leave
that cat alone.

973
00:58:07,517 --> 00:58:10,752
Bob, so, can you see
what i can do here?

974
00:58:10,819 --> 00:58:13,122
You can make
a lot of soup.

975
00:58:15,024 --> 00:58:16,292
Bob, I'm serious.

976
00:58:16,359 --> 00:58:17,759
I take you
seriously, harriet.

977
00:58:17,827 --> 00:58:19,329
I always did.
You know that.

978
00:58:19,395 --> 00:58:20,763
Well, then,
make the numbers work.

979
00:58:20,830 --> 00:58:22,565
Put it together, bob,
and make it work.

980
00:58:22,632 --> 00:58:25,201
Wow!

981
00:58:35,511 --> 00:58:36,846
Vanilla.

982
00:58:38,347 --> 00:58:39,782
What do you want?

983
00:58:39,848 --> 00:58:41,283
Oh, uh...
strawberry!

984
00:58:41,350 --> 00:58:42,685
Strawberry? What?

985
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:44,053
Ok, strawberry.

986
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,087
Strawberry.

987
00:58:45,154 --> 00:58:46,823
And chocolate.

988
00:58:46,890 --> 00:58:48,290
Chocolate.

989
00:58:48,357 --> 00:58:49,558
Bananas.

00:58:49,625 --> 00:58:52,762

00:59:29,732 --> 00:59:31,700
Why wrap yourself up
in this place?

1003
00:59:31,767 --> 00:59:33,169
It's like
a big tomb.

1004
00:59:33,236 --> 00:59:35,938
All your vitality,
why do you want to bury it in here?

1005
00:59:36,004 --> 00:59:37,606
Well, because this
is good, bob.

1006
00:59:37,673 --> 00:59:39,107
This is
a good investment.

1007
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:41,010
I'll do my best.

1008
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:46,716
That looks good.

1009
00:59:46,782 --> 00:59:49,151
What do you
got there?

1010
00:59:49,218 --> 00:59:51,953
A banana split!

1011
00:59:52,021 --> 00:59:54,390
Uh-Huh.

1012
00:59:54,456 --> 00:59:56,326
May i have a taste?

1013
01:00:03,365 --> 01:00:04,966
Mmm!

1014
01:00:05,034 --> 01:00:06,535
That's good!

1015
01:00:06,602 --> 01:00:09,404
You know,
i have a boy your age.

1016
01:00:09,472 --> 01:00:13,009
I'm giving him a birthday
party in a couple of weeks.

1017
01:00:13,075 --> 01:00:14,377
Like to come?

1018
01:00:17,613 --> 01:00:19,080
Sure.

1019
01:00:19,148 --> 01:00:20,483
Good!

1020
01:00:20,549 --> 01:00:22,985
You like a party,
don't you, harriet?

1021
01:00:23,052 --> 01:00:24,287
Oh, yeah!

1022
01:00:24,354 --> 01:00:25,988
Got to go.

1023
01:00:26,054 --> 01:00:28,924
Wait a minute, bob.
There's so much i want to show you.

1024
01:00:28,991 --> 01:00:32,194
I've seen enough.
I'll run some numbers and get back to you.

1025
01:00:32,261 --> 01:00:33,495
So long, albert.

1026
01:00:33,562 --> 01:00:35,064
Don't get no
tummy ache.

1027
01:00:36,665 --> 01:00:39,736
So long, bob.

1028
01:00:41,070 --> 01:00:42,505
Run the numbers, bob.

1029
01:00:42,571 --> 01:00:45,375
I'll do the best
i can, harriet.

1030
01:00:47,610 --> 01:00:49,512
Ask her if she wants
a banana split.

1031
01:00:49,579 --> 01:00:50,880
She won't.

1032
01:00:52,415 --> 01:00:54,416
She won't what?

1033
01:00:54,483 --> 01:00:56,018
Nothing.

1034
01:00:56,085 --> 01:00:58,087
Come on.

1035
01:01:02,591 --> 01:01:04,026
Listen, uh...
this is the deal.

1036
01:01:04,093 --> 01:01:06,729
I brought him here to
show him all of this

1037
01:01:06,796 --> 01:01:09,031
Because i want him to give
me the money to get it.

1038
01:01:09,098 --> 01:01:11,033
Now because of you,
we're going to a party,

1039
01:01:11,099 --> 01:01:13,035
So i want you
to take bob aside,

1040
01:01:13,102 --> 01:01:15,037
And i want you
to say, "bob,

1041
01:01:15,104 --> 01:01:17,038
This investment is
great for your bank."

1042
01:01:17,106 --> 01:01:18,741
Repeat that to me
right now.

1043
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,344
This investment
is great for your bank.

1044
01:01:26,749 --> 01:01:29,618
Albert, can i ask
you a question?

1045
01:01:29,685 --> 01:01:32,288
Who do you talk to
all the time?

1046
01:01:33,622 --> 01:01:36,893
Bogus.

1047
01:01:36,959 --> 01:01:40,730
And, uh...where's
your friend come from?

1048
01:01:40,796 --> 01:01:44,165
France. He's french.

1049
01:01:44,233 --> 01:01:45,000
French.

1050
01:01:45,067 --> 01:01:48,136
Oui.

1051
01:01:48,203 --> 01:01:50,072
Listen, albert,
i got to tell you.

1052
01:01:50,139 --> 01:01:52,074
I'd feel a lot
more comfortable

1053
01:01:52,140 --> 01:01:54,109
If you had
some visible friends.

1054
01:01:54,176 --> 01:01:55,444
See, then i wouldn't care

1055
01:01:55,511 --> 01:01:58,580
If they were from france
or germany or ethiopia.

1056
01:01:58,647 --> 01:02:00,883
Tell her about
ethiopia.

1057
01:02:00,949 --> 01:02:04,953
Ethiopia is in the
northern part of africa.

1058
01:02:05,020 --> 01:02:07,757
Children in ethiopia
are very hungry.

1059
01:02:07,824 --> 01:02:11,027
There's a drought there.
That means no rain.

1060
01:02:12,728 --> 01:02:15,464
Liza minnelli
went there once

1061
01:02:15,531 --> 01:02:17,366
With shirley maclaine.

1062
01:02:18,701 --> 01:02:21,337
Mom told me audrey hepburn
made them come.

1063
01:02:29,177 --> 01:02:31,680
How do you
know all that?

1064
01:02:31,747 --> 01:02:35,051
I wrote a report.
My mom helped me.

1065
01:02:38,053 --> 01:02:40,056
You want
a root beer?

1066
01:02:42,257 --> 01:02:44,927
You know, albert,
you're so smart.

1067
01:02:44,994 --> 01:02:47,496
I...i just don't
think you need

1068
01:02:47,563 --> 01:02:49,131
That french guy anymore.

1069
01:02:49,197 --> 01:02:51,367
Let me
take care of him.

1070
01:02:55,772 --> 01:03:00,542
Say there, mr. Bogus,
i don't think albert...

1071
01:03:00,609 --> 01:03:02,511
That's not where he is.

1072
01:03:02,577 --> 01:03:04,012
He's not teeny-Tiny?

1073
01:03:04,079 --> 01:03:05,514
He's bigger
than you are.

1074
01:03:05,580 --> 01:03:07,049
Oh.

1075
01:03:09,952 --> 01:03:11,553
Oh! Ha ha!

1076
01:03:11,620 --> 01:03:15,223
Of course he is!
Look at him standing right over there.

1077
01:03:15,290 --> 01:03:17,726
Listen,
it's time for you to go back to france.

1078
01:03:17,793 --> 01:03:20,029
You know,
albert doesn't really need you anymore.

1079
01:03:20,095 --> 01:03:24,533
I know! No,
i know that you're not happy here in newark.

1080
01:03:24,600 --> 01:03:27,669
You hate newark.
I know you do.

1081
01:03:27,736 --> 01:03:29,839
Oh. Well,
no, you agree.

1082
01:03:29,906 --> 01:03:31,540
Of course.

1083
01:03:31,607 --> 01:03:34,543
Ha ha! Thank you.

1084
01:03:34,610 --> 01:03:37,546
Well, it's been real.

1085
01:03:37,613 --> 01:03:39,348
Bye-Bye now.

1086
01:03:39,415 --> 01:03:41,217
Au revoir.

1087
01:03:44,019 --> 01:03:46,555
Voila. He's gone.

1088
01:03:48,123 --> 01:03:49,892
You didn't really
see him.

1089
01:03:49,959 --> 01:03:51,359
Of course i did.

1090
01:03:51,426 --> 01:03:54,429
What was he wearing?

1091
01:03:54,496 --> 01:03:56,465
A coat.

1092
01:03:57,966 --> 01:04:02,505
A big coat.
A big, french coat.

1093
01:04:03,972 --> 01:04:06,409
What color was it?

1094
01:04:06,475 --> 01:04:10,779
Brown. He was wearing
a big, french, brown coat,

1095
01:04:10,846 --> 01:04:12,815
And he said
to say good-Bye,

1096
01:04:12,882 --> 01:04:16,085
So why don't you finish your spaghetti,
have an oreo cookie,

1097
01:04:16,152 --> 01:04:18,320
And I'm going to finish
my phone calls, ok?

1098
01:04:18,387 --> 01:04:21,324
See, we're working
it out, albert.

1099
01:04:24,760 --> 01:04:26,162
Bogus.

1100
01:04:31,734 --> 01:04:33,903
Bogus.

1101
01:04:35,404 --> 01:04:36,639
Bogus?

1102
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,179
Bogus?

1103
01:04:45,248 --> 01:04:46,916
Bogus!

1104
01:04:52,321 --> 01:04:54,623
Bogus, you can
come out now.

1105
01:04:54,690 --> 01:04:56,892
Rrrr...

1106
01:04:58,693 --> 01:05:00,129
Oh!

1107
01:05:00,195 --> 01:05:03,332
Where were you?
Why did you disappear?

1108
01:05:03,399 --> 01:05:04,433
She fooled you.

1109
01:05:04,500 --> 01:05:07,102
She fooled me, too,
for a minute.

1110
01:05:07,169 --> 01:05:09,004
I thought i was gone.

1111
01:05:09,071 --> 01:05:11,674
Pendent une minute,
j'ai cru que j'etais parti.

1112
01:05:14,910 --> 01:05:18,047
I don't want you
to leave me again.

1113
01:05:18,114 --> 01:05:19,415
That's an order.

1114
01:05:19,481 --> 01:05:21,117
Oui, mon general.

1115
01:05:21,183 --> 01:05:24,987
You're my friend,
and i want you to always be my friend.

1116
01:05:25,054 --> 01:05:27,156
For as long
as you need me.

1117
01:05:27,223 --> 01:05:28,624
I'll always need you.

1118
01:05:30,225 --> 01:05:34,096
You're my best friend.
My only friend.

1119
01:05:34,162 --> 01:05:36,165
You're my mon ami.

1120
01:05:36,231 --> 01:05:39,668
I am your
best friend.

1121
01:05:39,735 --> 01:05:42,671
I know you better
than anyone.

1122
01:05:42,737 --> 01:05:45,674
Better than anyone.

1123
01:05:45,741 --> 01:05:49,412
Better than you
know yourself.

1124
01:07:23,405 --> 01:07:25,107
Hello.

1125
01:07:51,367 --> 01:07:52,801
Hello.

1126
01:07:52,868 --> 01:07:54,936
Harriet?

1127
01:07:55,003 --> 01:07:56,805
Hello?

1128
01:07:56,872 --> 01:07:58,374
Hello.

1129
01:08:00,209 --> 01:08:02,644
Would you like
to see me?

1130
01:08:02,711 --> 01:08:03,812
Mmm...

1131
01:08:10,051 --> 01:08:11,386
Huh!

1132
01:08:16,892 --> 01:08:18,461
Albert?

1133
01:08:37,546 --> 01:08:40,182
Albert, were you
in my room last night?

1134
01:08:40,249 --> 01:08:42,084
No.

1135
01:08:51,093 --> 01:08:53,062
Let's go.

1136
01:08:53,127 --> 01:08:54,729
Uhh!

1137
01:09:06,841 --> 01:09:08,743
Uhh...

1138
01:09:28,930 --> 01:09:32,267
Words starting
with "a." Anybody else?

1139
01:09:32,334 --> 01:09:33,835
Artichoke.

1140
01:09:33,902 --> 01:09:36,738
Artichoke. What
a wonderful word, angela.

1141
01:09:36,805 --> 01:09:39,140
That will be
fun to use in a sentence.

1142
01:09:39,207 --> 01:09:41,142
I'll show you
how to spell it.

1143
01:09:41,209 --> 01:09:43,845
I know how to spell it.

1144
01:09:43,912 --> 01:09:45,280
How about alaska?

1145
01:09:45,345 --> 01:09:48,116
Good, thomas.
Alaska's a good subject.

1146
01:09:48,183 --> 01:09:49,850
It's our country's
largest state.

1147
01:09:49,917 --> 01:09:52,420
I know that.

1148
01:09:53,822 --> 01:09:56,825
Uh, words
beginning with "b."

1149
01:09:56,892 --> 01:09:58,394
Albert?

1150
01:09:59,895 --> 01:10:01,330
Bogus.

1151
01:10:01,397 --> 01:10:04,332
Bogus. Well, what
a grown-Up word.

1152
01:10:04,399 --> 01:10:06,968
Can you tell me
what it means?

1153
01:10:07,035 --> 01:10:10,505
It means...

1154
01:10:10,572 --> 01:10:12,340
Friend.

1155
01:10:12,407 --> 01:10:14,175
I'm afraid that's
not right, albert.

1156
01:10:14,242 --> 01:10:15,477
Bogus is a word
you'll use

1157
01:10:15,544 --> 01:10:16,979
When you're
a little older.

1158
01:10:17,045 --> 01:10:18,279
It means fake.

1159
01:10:18,346 --> 01:10:20,315
Something that
is not real.

1160
01:10:20,382 --> 01:10:21,650
No, bogus is real.

1161
01:10:21,717 --> 01:10:22,817
Bogus is not real.

1162
01:10:22,885 --> 01:10:25,321
The word bogus means just
the opposite of real.

1163
01:10:25,387 --> 01:10:27,422
It means pretending
to be real.

1164
01:10:27,489 --> 01:10:30,525
Something not being
what it seems to be.

1165
01:10:30,592 --> 01:10:33,161
It's very important you not
confuse the meaning of words.

1166
01:10:33,228 --> 01:10:35,497
Ha ha!

1167
01:10:35,564 --> 01:10:37,866
What are you looking at, albert?
What's so funny?

1168
01:10:39,301 --> 01:10:42,170
Mmm...nothing.

1169
01:10:42,237 --> 01:10:43,838
Well, now, then,
albert,

1170
01:10:43,905 --> 01:10:46,575
Can you tell me the correct
meaning of the word bogus?

1171
01:10:49,911 --> 01:10:51,846
It means...

1172
01:10:51,913 --> 01:10:53,481
Friend.

1173
01:10:53,548 --> 01:10:56,951
No, no, no!
Bogus means fake!

1174
01:10:57,018 --> 01:10:58,487
Bogus is not fake!

1175
01:10:58,554 --> 01:11:01,290
Don't you shout
at me, young man!

1176
01:11:01,356 --> 01:11:03,358
No, bogus is real!
He's always been real!

1177
01:11:05,360 --> 01:11:07,062
All right.

1178
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:08,363
All right, um...

1179
01:11:08,430 --> 01:11:10,899
We'll talk
about this later on.

1180
01:11:10,966 --> 01:11:12,968
You can sit down.

1181
01:11:15,504 --> 01:11:18,373
Um...we'll go on.

1182
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:22,143
Words starting
with the letter "c."

1183
01:11:22,210 --> 01:11:23,578
Oh, right here.

1184
01:11:23,645 --> 01:11:24,479
Jeffrey.

1185
01:11:28,783 --> 01:11:31,386
Bob morrison's kid's
birthday party.

1186
01:11:31,453 --> 01:11:34,423
Uh-Uh. Tell him
I'm in philadelphia.

1187
01:11:34,489 --> 01:11:37,092
Oh, come on, harriet.
It will be fun.

1188
01:11:37,159 --> 01:11:39,094
It will be good
for albert.

1189
01:11:39,161 --> 01:11:40,595
He'll meet other kids.

1190
01:11:40,662 --> 01:11:42,597
What scares you about
a birthday party?

1191
01:11:44,166 --> 01:11:45,901
Take it out
of my paycheck.

1192
01:11:45,967 --> 01:11:47,402
Who said anything
about being scared?

1193
01:11:47,469 --> 01:11:49,104
I'm not scared
of anything.

1194
01:11:49,170 --> 01:11:50,872
Then what's your problem?

1195
01:11:50,939 --> 01:11:52,107
He's 7.

1196
01:11:52,174 --> 01:11:55,143
7. His mother died.
He loved her.

1197
01:11:55,210 --> 01:11:56,411
He's got to
work it out.

1198
01:11:56,477 --> 01:11:58,413
I know he's 7.
I know his mother died.

1199
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:00,415
I also have to
work it out.

1200
01:12:00,482 --> 01:12:02,117
But you're not 7.

1201
01:12:02,183 --> 01:12:03,619
Some part
of me is 7!

1202
01:12:03,685 --> 01:12:05,921
Let the part that's 7
be friends with his 7.

1203
01:12:05,988 --> 01:12:08,423
What are you, sigmund freud?
Stop analyzing me.

1204
01:12:08,490 --> 01:12:09,992
You are my secretary!

1205
01:12:13,194 --> 01:12:15,731
Take the kid
to the party.

1206
01:12:23,571 --> 01:12:26,809
Are you ready
for a surprise?

1207
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,510
Yeah!

1208
01:12:28,576 --> 01:12:33,148
It's me, dr. Surprise!

1209
01:12:33,215 --> 01:12:37,318
Yay!

1210
01:12:37,518 --> 01:12:40,121
Do you like
surprises?

1211
01:12:40,188 --> 01:12:42,057
Yes!

1212
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,026
Harriet,
harriet, harriet.

1213
01:12:44,092 --> 01:12:45,994
Ha ha ha!

1214
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:47,295
Here's a party hat
for you.

1215
01:12:47,362 --> 01:12:48,464
I don't...

1216
01:12:48,530 --> 01:12:50,833
Uh, yes, harriet.
Yes, yes, yes.

1217
01:12:50,899 --> 01:12:51,599
Hey, doug.

1218
01:12:51,666 --> 01:12:52,967
Hi, bob.
How are you?

1219
01:12:53,034 --> 01:12:56,471
Long time no see.
Here's a hat for you.

1220
01:12:56,538 --> 01:12:58,674
Kid's having a great
time, harriet.

1221
01:12:58,741 --> 01:12:59,941
Oh, yeah.

1222
01:13:00,008 --> 01:13:00,976
Have some cake.

1223
01:13:01,043 --> 01:13:02,376
I don't...

1224
01:13:02,444 --> 01:13:04,179
Come on, harriet.
Have a piece of cake.

1225
01:13:04,246 --> 01:13:05,613
This is a nice house.

1226
01:13:05,680 --> 01:13:07,182
Well, i got
the house.

1227
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:08,683
My wife
got the money.

1228
01:13:08,750 --> 01:13:11,486
Yes. I always thought it
was the other way around.

1229
01:13:11,553 --> 01:13:13,488
Listen, um...
about the loan...

1230
01:13:13,554 --> 01:13:15,189
It's a party,
harriet.

1231
01:13:15,256 --> 01:13:17,258
We'll talk
about it later.

1232
01:13:17,325 --> 01:13:19,094
Yay!

1233
01:13:19,160 --> 01:13:23,498
Is everybody having fun
at dougie's birthday party?

1234
01:13:23,565 --> 01:13:26,367
Yeah!

1235
01:13:26,567 --> 01:13:29,204
And now, i want you
to feast your eyes

1236
01:13:29,270 --> 01:13:30,572
On the magic closet:

1237
01:13:30,638 --> 01:13:34,642
Dr. Surprise's
cabinet of mystery!

1238
01:13:34,709 --> 01:13:37,077
Ha ha ha!
Ho ho!

1239
01:13:37,145 --> 01:13:41,783
The one and only place
that's guaranteed to show you

1240
01:13:41,850 --> 01:13:44,685
Things as they
really are.

1241
01:13:44,752 --> 01:13:46,855
It's the double-Door
trick.

1242
01:13:46,922 --> 01:13:50,157
Magic wand,
oh, magic wand.

1243
01:13:50,224 --> 01:13:52,528
Choose, magic wand...

1244
01:13:52,594 --> 01:13:57,232
That lovely lady
across the lawn!

1245
01:13:57,299 --> 01:13:59,234
Please, come up
and help us.

1246
01:13:59,301 --> 01:14:00,668
Yeah, you. Yes.

1247
01:14:00,735 --> 01:14:03,038
No. No, thank you.
Get somebody else.

1248
01:14:03,105 --> 01:14:04,906
You're the one.

1249
01:14:04,973 --> 01:14:07,809
No, I'm not.
Just do your magic trick.

1250
01:14:07,876 --> 01:14:10,679
Are we going
to let this lady

1251
01:14:10,746 --> 01:14:13,014
Get away from
the magic closet?

1252
01:14:13,081 --> 01:14:14,950
No!

1253
01:14:15,150 --> 01:14:19,454
Then let's find out
who she really is.

1254
01:14:19,521 --> 01:14:22,190
Go and get her!
Ha ha ha!

1255
01:14:22,257 --> 01:14:24,325
No! Come on, now!

1256
01:14:24,392 --> 01:14:25,760
Stop!

1257
01:14:25,828 --> 01:14:27,095
Ha ha ha!

1258
01:14:27,162 --> 01:14:29,765
Ho ho ho!

1259
01:14:29,832 --> 01:14:31,065
Ow!

1260
01:14:31,132 --> 01:14:34,201
I'm sorry. Tell her
i didn't mean to hurt her.

1261
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:36,205
Ok, kids, come on.
Back to your seats.

1262
01:14:36,271 --> 01:14:38,273
Come on, right now.
Hurry up, everyone.

1263
01:14:38,340 --> 01:14:39,507
Choose me,
dr. Surprise.

1264
01:14:39,574 --> 01:14:41,710
I'll do it.

1265
01:14:41,777 --> 01:14:43,278
What's the matter
with you, harriet?

1266
01:14:43,345 --> 01:14:45,046
I told him i didn't
want to play.

1267
01:14:45,113 --> 01:14:47,182
I said no!

1268
01:14:47,249 --> 01:14:49,584
Just settle down,
kids. Settle down. Yes.

1269
01:14:49,651 --> 01:14:52,053
Are you ready
for another surprise?

1270
01:14:52,120 --> 01:14:52,787
Yes!

1271
01:14:52,987 --> 01:14:55,457
What am i
supposed to do?

1272
01:14:55,524 --> 01:14:58,259
Right into the box,
my little cinnamon bun.

1273
01:14:58,326 --> 01:15:00,262
Here is
the big surprise!

1274
01:15:00,329 --> 01:15:02,697
Are you ready
in the closet?

1275
01:15:02,764 --> 01:15:05,433
Yes, i am, dr. Surprise.

1276
01:15:05,500 --> 01:15:07,135
Ha ha ha!

1277
01:15:07,201 --> 01:15:08,871
Sim sola bim!

1278
01:15:11,940 --> 01:15:15,442
Huh! Momma!
Where's my momma?

1279
01:15:27,722 --> 01:15:30,659
Dr. Surprise isn't really
a very good magician.

1280
01:15:32,060 --> 01:15:33,795
No, he's not.

1281
01:15:52,213 --> 01:15:53,749
That's pretty good.

1282
01:15:56,250 --> 01:15:57,486
I hold it this way,

1283
01:15:57,552 --> 01:15:59,420
And you can't
see it.

1284
01:15:59,488 --> 01:16:01,990
And i do this.
See?

1285
01:16:02,057 --> 01:16:04,992
And it drops
down here. See?

1286
01:16:05,060 --> 01:16:07,195
It's called
the french pass.

1287
01:16:07,262 --> 01:16:09,364
More french, huh?

1288
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,332
I've got
a better one.

1289
01:16:11,399 --> 01:16:12,700
Mr. Antoine
taught me.

1290
01:16:12,767 --> 01:16:15,269
He's the best magician
in las vegas.

1291
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:19,675
Look, i don't have time
for this right now.

1292
01:16:19,741 --> 01:16:22,377
I have these bills
i have to pay.

1293
01:16:22,444 --> 01:16:24,079
I just really
don't have time.

1294
01:16:44,599 --> 01:16:46,100
I hate her!

1295
01:16:46,167 --> 01:16:48,103
I hate her!

1296
01:16:51,806 --> 01:16:54,543
He wants to show you
a trick. That's all.

1297
01:16:54,609 --> 01:16:56,612
Why you
push him away?

1298
01:17:00,048 --> 01:17:03,050
And now
you feel so bad.

1299
01:17:03,118 --> 01:17:08,624
Harriet, why do you
want to feel so bad?

1300
01:17:50,665 --> 01:17:52,100
What is this?

1301
01:17:52,167 --> 01:17:57,172
Belasco's 12,456
pink coasters.

1302
01:17:59,173 --> 01:18:02,744
I will be so glad when I'm
out of the coaster business.

1303
01:18:06,681 --> 01:18:09,617
Let me get you
a cup of coffee.

1304
01:18:09,684 --> 01:18:11,119
What's wrong?

1305
01:18:11,185 --> 01:18:13,054
Bob morrison
called this morning.

1306
01:18:13,121 --> 01:18:14,289
Yeah?

1307
01:18:14,356 --> 01:18:16,124
He said the bank won't
give you the loan.

1308
01:18:16,191 --> 01:18:17,626
He says he really
wishes he could,

1309
01:18:17,692 --> 01:18:18,960
But he doesn't think

1310
01:18:19,027 --> 01:18:20,795
He can get it through
the loan committee.

1311
01:18:20,861 --> 01:18:22,630
He doesn't think
he can get it through?

1312
01:18:22,697 --> 01:18:24,132
Get him on the phone.

1313
01:18:24,198 --> 01:18:26,334
He's out of town all day.
You can't reach him.

1314
01:18:26,401 --> 01:18:27,635
He gave me
his home number

1315
01:18:27,702 --> 01:18:29,137
In case you want to
talk to him later.

1316
01:18:29,204 --> 01:18:30,838
I don't want
to talk to him later.

1317
01:18:30,905 --> 01:18:32,639
I want to see him
face-To-Face tonight.

1318
01:18:32,707 --> 01:18:34,876
Get on the phone,
and tell him i want to see him tonight.

1319
01:18:34,943 --> 01:18:36,445
What about albert?

1320
01:18:36,511 --> 01:18:38,813
I'll get the lady downstairs.
She'll babysit.

1321
01:18:38,880 --> 01:18:40,949
She doesn't charge
for invisible friends.

1322
01:18:42,584 --> 01:18:44,652
What's your order?

1323
01:18:44,719 --> 01:18:47,655
2 martinis.

1324
01:18:47,722 --> 01:18:50,657
Harvey, it seems
that veta is having

1325
01:18:50,725 --> 01:18:52,360
A party
this afternoon...

1326
01:19:31,299 --> 01:19:33,701
Ohh...

1327
01:19:33,768 --> 01:19:36,204
It's a bad idea,
albert.

1328
01:19:36,271 --> 01:19:37,705
It's a bad idea.

1329
01:19:37,772 --> 01:19:39,407
You can't stop me.

1330
01:19:39,474 --> 01:19:41,409
But it's too far.

1331
01:19:41,476 --> 01:19:43,678
It's only
2 hours by bus.

1332
01:19:43,745 --> 01:19:46,414
I saw it in an ad.

1333
01:19:46,481 --> 01:19:48,383
Oh, i don't like this.

1334
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:56,724
It's a bad idea.

1335
01:19:56,791 --> 01:19:58,293
Don't follow me.

1336
01:20:41,169 --> 01:20:43,939
Do you want to go
to atlantic city?

1337
01:20:56,184 --> 01:20:58,786
Well, thank you,
harvey.

1338
01:20:58,853 --> 01:21:00,488
I prefer you, too.

1339
01:21:00,554 --> 01:21:01,990
Ha ha ha!

1340
01:21:08,863 --> 01:21:09,964
Hi.

1341
01:21:10,031 --> 01:21:12,500
Huh? Oh, hi.

1342
01:21:12,566 --> 01:21:14,369
What a lovely movie.

1343
01:21:15,870 --> 01:21:17,305
Everything ok?

1344
01:21:17,372 --> 01:21:20,508
Fine. He's such
a good little boy.

1345
01:21:20,574 --> 01:21:21,808
Is he asleep?

1346
01:21:21,876 --> 01:21:24,311
Not a sound.
At least not now.

1347
01:21:24,378 --> 01:21:26,813
He was in there
talking to somebody,

1348
01:21:26,881 --> 01:21:28,516
If you know
what i mean.

1349
01:21:28,583 --> 01:21:30,317
Yeah. What do
i owe you?

1350
01:21:30,384 --> 01:21:33,321
Uh, $4.00 an hour,
that will be $18.00.

1351
01:21:33,387 --> 01:21:34,822
Ok.

1352
01:21:34,889 --> 01:21:36,324
Oh, thank you.

1353
01:21:36,390 --> 01:21:38,326
You know, when my
daughter was small,

1354
01:21:38,393 --> 01:21:40,327
She used to talk to
herself all the time.

1355
01:21:40,394 --> 01:21:41,463
Really?

1356
01:21:41,529 --> 01:21:43,531
Yeah. I even had to
set an extra place

1357
01:21:43,598 --> 01:21:44,832
For somebody
named trinket.

1358
01:21:44,899 --> 01:21:46,401
Hell, they were
real close.

1359
01:21:46,468 --> 01:21:48,570
Good night.

1360
01:22:08,923 --> 01:22:10,425
Albert?

1361
01:22:17,465 --> 01:22:18,600
Albert?

1362
01:22:19,934 --> 01:22:21,869
Come on,
what are you doing?

1363
01:22:21,936 --> 01:22:23,938
Come on, albert,
where are you?

1364
01:22:26,440 --> 01:22:27,608
Albert!

1365
01:22:35,483 --> 01:22:37,619
Albert?

1366
01:22:48,796 --> 01:22:50,298
Damn!

1367
01:22:58,973 --> 01:23:01,676
Albert! A bad idea.

1368
01:23:05,813 --> 01:23:08,083
It's still a bad idea!

1369
01:23:27,535 --> 01:23:28,568
Ah, voila.

1370
01:23:28,636 --> 01:23:30,038
Merci!

1371
01:23:50,090 --> 01:23:51,659
Hi, gomez.

1372
01:23:51,726 --> 01:23:52,960
It's me, albert.

1373
01:24:03,538 --> 01:24:05,072
Hi!

1374
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:08,875
It's me...Albert.

1375
01:24:08,943 --> 01:24:13,047
Albert! But what
are you doing here?

1376
01:24:13,114 --> 01:24:14,848
Mon petit chou.
Mon petit chou.

1377
01:24:14,916 --> 01:24:16,217
What are you
doing here?

1378
01:24:16,284 --> 01:24:18,818
It will not work.
They will send you back.

1379
01:24:18,886 --> 01:24:20,688
No, they won't.
They love me.

1380
01:24:20,754 --> 01:24:21,989
Of course
we love you.

1381
01:24:22,056 --> 01:24:23,558
But how did
you get here?

1382
01:24:23,625 --> 01:24:24,993
On the bus.

1383
01:24:25,059 --> 01:24:27,695
On the bus?
Who'd you come with?

1384
01:24:27,762 --> 01:24:28,996
Where's
your godmother?

1385
01:24:29,063 --> 01:24:30,565
Where is harriet?
Where?

1386
01:24:32,667 --> 01:24:35,703
I ran away.
I'm never going back.

1387
01:24:35,770 --> 01:24:37,405
I want to stay
with you.

1388
01:24:40,274 --> 01:24:43,011
I can't believe you have done this,
albert.

1389
01:24:43,077 --> 01:24:45,146
You are crazy!

1390
01:24:45,213 --> 01:24:47,014
I can do
the egg trick.

1391
01:24:47,081 --> 01:24:49,049
I can do
the double disappear.

1392
01:24:49,116 --> 01:24:50,618
C'est ridicule.

1393
01:24:50,685 --> 01:24:52,153
II doit retourner
chez sa tante,

1394
01:24:52,219 --> 01:24:53,521
Et le plus
tot sera le mieux.

1395
01:24:53,588 --> 01:24:55,589
Ne sois pas bete,
antoine.

1396
01:24:55,656 --> 01:24:57,358
J'essaie de lui dire que
c'est une mauvaise idee.

1397
01:24:57,424 --> 01:25:01,228
You can cut me in half
if you want to...

1398
01:25:01,295 --> 01:25:02,896
And i can learn more.

1399
01:25:02,963 --> 01:25:04,965
I can do the egg trick.

1400
01:25:05,033 --> 01:25:07,235
Anything you want me to do.

1401
01:25:07,301 --> 01:25:08,569
Quiet down, albert.

1402
01:25:08,636 --> 01:25:10,538
You rest now, ok?

1403
01:25:10,604 --> 01:25:13,141
Doucement,
doucement.

1404
01:25:14,441 --> 01:25:17,077
I take off
your shoes, ok?

1405
01:25:17,145 --> 01:25:18,579
Now rest.

1406
01:25:18,646 --> 01:25:20,748
Rest.

1407
01:25:20,814 --> 01:25:26,387
And later,
we will take you for hot cakes, ok?

1408
01:25:26,454 --> 01:25:29,255
But we have to call
your godmother.

1409
01:25:29,323 --> 01:25:31,392
I want to stay
with you.

1410
01:25:31,459 --> 01:25:33,994
You cannot stay with us.

1411
01:25:34,061 --> 01:25:35,597
Is impossible.

1412
01:25:35,663 --> 01:25:38,464
But we love you
very, very much.

1413
01:25:38,532 --> 01:25:40,768
Mm-Hmm,
but is impossible.

1414
01:25:40,835 --> 01:25:42,637
Now sleep.

1415
01:25:45,206 --> 01:25:47,174
Sleep.

1416
01:25:47,241 --> 01:25:50,912
Oh, magic...sleep.

1417
01:25:50,979 --> 01:25:54,281
Now, you sleep.

1418
01:25:54,348 --> 01:25:57,352
Sleep.
No more troubles.

1419
01:25:57,418 --> 01:26:00,554
Just peaceful sleep.

1420
01:26:00,621 --> 01:26:03,190
Hush.

1421
01:26:03,257 --> 01:26:07,061
Sleep. Hush, hush.

1422
01:26:07,128 --> 01:26:09,663
Hush.

1423
01:26:09,730 --> 01:26:13,468
Fermez les yeux.
Close your eyes.

1424
01:26:13,535 --> 01:26:18,639
Shh. Hush.

1425
01:26:18,706 --> 01:26:20,842
Sleep.

1426
01:26:22,176 --> 01:26:23,678
Hush.

1427
01:26:43,364 --> 01:26:44,699
Bogus?

1428
01:26:46,501 --> 01:26:48,836
Bogus?

1429
01:26:48,903 --> 01:26:50,705
I'm here.

1430
01:26:55,075 --> 01:26:56,878
I'm not going back.

1431
01:26:56,944 --> 01:26:58,746
Shh.

1432
01:27:00,014 --> 01:27:02,183
Yes, you will.

1433
01:27:02,249 --> 01:27:03,851
You have
to be strong.

1434
01:27:03,918 --> 01:27:05,353
She comes for you.

1435
01:27:05,419 --> 01:27:07,521
I want my mom.

1436
01:27:07,588 --> 01:27:09,322
I know.

1437
01:27:09,389 --> 01:27:11,859
I want to find her.

1438
01:27:11,926 --> 01:27:14,128
I want to go
to your world.

1439
01:27:14,195 --> 01:27:17,130
But I'm not real.

1440
01:27:17,198 --> 01:27:20,668
I am imagination.

1441
01:27:20,734 --> 01:27:23,805
I am...bogus.

1442
01:27:27,174 --> 01:27:28,475
I don't care.

1443
01:27:28,542 --> 01:27:31,011
I don't want to be here.

1444
01:27:31,078 --> 01:27:33,180
Take me to where
you come from.

1445
01:27:34,748 --> 01:27:38,518
It's not a real place.
It's dangerous.

1446
01:27:38,586 --> 01:27:42,423
You get lost...
and never come back.

1447
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:45,358
I'm going,
and you can't stop me!

1448
01:27:45,426 --> 01:27:47,695
Albert!
Albert, come back!

1449
01:27:47,761 --> 01:27:50,998
Albert!
Albert, albert!

1450
01:27:51,065 --> 01:27:53,101
Come back!

1451
01:28:26,300 --> 01:28:27,535
Ladies and gentlemen,

1452
01:28:27,602 --> 01:28:30,538
Please welcome
the one, the only...

1453
01:28:30,604 --> 01:28:32,740
The great albertini!

1454
01:28:59,567 --> 01:29:03,805
Watch, because i am about
to confound you.

1455
01:30:23,216 --> 01:30:24,585
Mom?

1456
01:30:26,253 --> 01:30:29,424
Mom!

1457
01:30:36,229 --> 01:30:39,100
Mom!

1458
01:30:44,271 --> 01:30:45,873
Mom!

1459
01:30:45,940 --> 01:30:47,607
Come back!

1460
01:30:54,247 --> 01:30:56,617
He's been here since we came off the stage.

1461
01:30:56,683 --> 01:30:57,885
He's anyway totally exhausted.

1462
01:30:57,951 --> 01:30:59,286
Of course he's exhausted.

1463
01:30:59,353 --> 01:31:01,689
Who the hell sells a bus ticket
to a little boy?

1464
01:31:01,756 --> 01:31:03,357
Aren't people
paying attention out there?

1465
01:31:03,423 --> 01:31:06,693
Shh. Don't wake him.
Watch him twitch... I think he dreams.

1466
01:31:06,760 --> 01:31:07,862
There's something
strange.

1467
01:31:07,928 --> 01:31:09,764
How come a little
boy like that

1468
01:31:09,831 --> 01:31:10,998
Can run away in the
middle of the night?

1469
01:31:11,064 --> 01:31:12,132
He's homesick.

1470
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:13,366
I still don't
understand.

1471
01:31:13,434 --> 01:31:14,969
You don't have
to understand

1472
01:31:15,035 --> 01:31:16,437
Because I'm his godmother.
I'm taking him home.

1473
01:31:16,504 --> 01:31:17,804
Whether you
want to or not.

1474
01:31:17,871 --> 01:31:19,940
I don't recall getting
any phone calls.

1475
01:31:20,006 --> 01:31:22,009
You guys never even checked
to see where the hell he was.

1476
01:31:22,076 --> 01:31:22,743
What about the...

1477
01:31:48,536 --> 01:31:50,538
Ok, little guy.

1478
01:31:52,039 --> 01:31:53,808
Up we go.

1479
01:31:57,044 --> 01:31:58,946
All right.

1480
01:32:18,599 --> 01:32:20,735
Ok.

1481
01:32:22,136 --> 01:32:23,838
We're home.

1482
01:32:29,276 --> 01:32:31,178
Now we'll get into bed.

1483
01:32:31,245 --> 01:32:33,080
It'll be great.

1484
01:32:34,781 --> 01:32:38,018
Oh, albert, i know we
got off to a rough start,

1485
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:40,721
But you're just going
to have to understand

1486
01:32:40,788 --> 01:32:43,056
This is where you live now.
This is your home.

1487
01:32:43,123 --> 01:32:44,892
You know?

1488
01:32:44,959 --> 01:32:48,663
But, it's probably too late
to be talking about this.

1489
01:32:48,729 --> 01:32:52,466
We can talk about it
over breakfast in the morning.

1490
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:57,671
You know, i'll make you
some french toast from scratch

1491
01:32:57,738 --> 01:32:59,707
'Cause i know
you like french stuff.

1492
01:32:59,773 --> 01:33:03,844
And maybe...Maybe i can find
some real syrup...

1493
01:33:03,911 --> 01:33:06,180
You know, the kind they have
from real trees.

1494
01:33:06,246 --> 01:33:08,582
I'm sure they must
have some somewhere.

1495
01:33:08,649 --> 01:33:10,918
You feel
a little bit cold.

1496
01:33:10,985 --> 01:33:14,420
Maybe i should make you
some soup, huh?

1497
01:33:14,488 --> 01:33:15,922
He doesn't need soup.

1498
01:33:15,989 --> 01:33:18,424
Yeah, i'll make you
a little bit of soup.

1499
01:33:18,492 --> 01:33:21,095
You know,
your mom loved soup.

1500
01:33:21,161 --> 01:33:22,930
There you go.

1501
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:26,233
And you? You're supposed
to be his best friend.

1502
01:33:26,300 --> 01:33:27,434
Where were you?

1503
01:33:27,501 --> 01:33:30,437
Why would you let him
go to atlantic city like that?

1504
01:33:30,504 --> 01:33:32,072
You're ok? Good.

1505
01:33:32,139 --> 01:33:34,641
You know, bogus, you ought
to start doing your job.

1506
01:33:34,708 --> 01:33:36,442
I do my job?
Do your job.

1507
01:33:36,510 --> 01:33:39,447
You don't do it well enough
as far as I'm concerned,

1508
01:33:39,513 --> 01:33:40,680
Because i do my job.

1509
01:33:40,747 --> 01:33:43,451
I do the best
that i can.

1510
01:33:43,517 --> 01:33:46,987
What more can i do?

1511
01:33:47,054 --> 01:33:50,490
I got albertitis.
I'm talking to myself.

1512
01:33:50,557 --> 01:33:53,126
No. You are talking
to bogus.

1513
01:33:53,194 --> 01:33:54,862
I'm talking to bogus?

1514
01:33:54,929 --> 01:33:58,165
Bogus is an imaginary character
on some little boy's wall.

1515
01:33:58,232 --> 01:33:59,900
You're not real.

1516
01:33:59,967 --> 01:34:02,469
No. It's time
to see me, harriet.

1517
01:34:02,536 --> 01:34:05,473
See you?
I don't see anything.

1518
01:34:05,539 --> 01:34:07,007
Where are you?

1519
01:34:07,074 --> 01:34:07,974
I'm here.

1520
01:34:08,042 --> 01:34:09,477
Where?

1521
01:34:09,543 --> 01:34:11,344
Here, harriet.

1522
01:34:13,380 --> 01:34:15,216
Just behind you.

1523
01:34:16,383 --> 01:34:19,019
Don't be afraid.

1524
01:34:19,085 --> 01:34:21,322
Try.

1525
01:34:21,389 --> 01:34:23,791
I'm here.

1526
01:34:25,559 --> 01:34:28,362
Believe, harriet,
and you will see.

1527
01:34:30,564 --> 01:34:32,066
I'm waiting.

1528
01:34:46,112 --> 01:34:47,181
Aah!

1529
01:34:47,248 --> 01:34:48,514
Don't be afraid!

1530
01:34:48,582 --> 01:34:50,183
Stop, harriet.
Don't be afraid.

1531
01:34:50,250 --> 01:34:52,686
There's a big white
man in my kitchen!

1532
01:34:52,753 --> 01:34:55,222
Get out of here!
Get away from me!

1533
01:34:55,289 --> 01:34:56,255
No, no, no!

1534
01:34:56,323 --> 01:34:57,490
Harriet!

1535
01:34:57,557 --> 01:35:00,126
I'm a part of you,
harriet.

1536
01:35:00,194 --> 01:35:01,661
No. Go away.

1537
01:35:01,728 --> 01:35:04,198
You are such
a difficult woman.

1538
01:35:04,265 --> 01:35:07,234
I said, go away.

1539
01:35:07,301 --> 01:35:09,370
How can i go away?

1540
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:10,371
Like this.

1541
01:35:10,437 --> 01:35:11,538
Oh!

1542
01:35:11,605 --> 01:35:13,706
Oh, you want
to play dirty?

1543
01:35:14,774 --> 01:35:16,209
Ow! Stop that!

1544
01:35:16,276 --> 01:35:18,412
That hurt.
What's the matter with you?

1545
01:35:18,479 --> 01:35:20,247
I said i didn't
want to play.

1546
01:35:20,314 --> 01:35:21,581
You have to play.

1547
01:35:21,648 --> 01:35:23,050
I don't have
to play with you!

1548
01:35:23,116 --> 01:35:24,918
This is all your fault,
you know that?

1549
01:35:24,985 --> 01:35:27,221
If not for you,
this little boy would be fine.

1550
01:35:27,288 --> 01:35:29,723
It's better I'm here.
You need me, harriet.

1551
01:35:29,790 --> 01:35:31,091
Oh, really?

1552
01:35:31,158 --> 01:35:32,059
Yeah.

1553
01:35:32,125 --> 01:35:33,727
I need a big
imaginary frenchman

1554
01:35:33,794 --> 01:35:35,394
Who comes in and
messes up my life?

1555
01:35:35,462 --> 01:35:36,663
No. This is nuts.

1556
01:35:36,730 --> 01:35:39,066
No, it's not nuts.
Is imagination.

1557
01:35:39,132 --> 01:35:42,068
Where is your imagination,
harriet?

1558
01:35:42,136 --> 01:35:46,073
My imagination is fine.
I see you, don't i?

1559
01:35:46,140 --> 01:35:48,575
Oh, there is
more to see.

1560
01:35:48,642 --> 01:35:51,577
Oh, really?
Oh, that's right.

1561
01:35:51,645 --> 01:35:54,447
That's right.
All right, so i should play with this

1562
01:35:54,514 --> 01:35:55,916
Because really
what you are

1563
01:35:55,983 --> 01:35:58,251
Is some little acorn
in my stomach

1564
01:35:58,318 --> 01:36:00,254
That i ate from
some damn doughnut.

1565
01:36:00,320 --> 01:36:01,255
Sort of, yes.

1566
01:36:01,322 --> 01:36:02,923
And there's 3 of you?

1567
01:36:02,990 --> 01:36:04,959
Is there a past,
present, and future?

1568
01:36:05,025 --> 01:36:05,759
Yes.

1569
01:36:05,825 --> 01:36:07,094
Oh, i see. Ok.

1570
01:36:07,160 --> 01:36:08,495
So at the end,
you're going to show me

1571
01:36:08,562 --> 01:36:09,930
How good a person
i can be,

1572
01:36:09,997 --> 01:36:11,632
And in the beginning,
you're going to show me

1573
01:36:11,699 --> 01:36:13,467
What a sad little girl
i was, aren't you?

1574
01:36:13,534 --> 01:36:15,268
You're going
to take me back

1575
01:36:15,336 --> 01:36:17,771
And show me the little harriet
who used to sit around

1576
01:36:17,838 --> 01:36:20,273
And wait for people
to come and play with her

1577
01:36:20,340 --> 01:36:22,977
And wait for mail from her mother,
and nobody ever wrote.

1578
01:36:23,043 --> 01:36:25,478
You going to sit around,
you going to explain that to me?

1579
01:36:27,380 --> 01:36:28,516
I understand.

1580
01:36:30,184 --> 01:36:32,285
I've been waiting
for that.

1581
01:36:32,352 --> 01:36:33,620
Really?

1582
01:36:33,687 --> 01:36:35,255
Yeah.

1583
01:36:35,322 --> 01:36:36,990
Where were you?

1584
01:36:37,057 --> 01:36:39,492
Where were you
when i needed you?

1585
01:36:39,560 --> 01:36:41,461
When i was little?

1586
01:36:41,528 --> 01:36:43,163
I was there.

1587
01:36:43,230 --> 01:36:44,130
Oh, yeah?

1588
01:36:44,198 --> 01:36:45,298
Yeah.

1589
01:36:45,365 --> 01:36:48,369
Right.

1590
01:36:54,207 --> 01:36:56,476
This little boy
doesn't even like me.

1591
01:36:56,543 --> 01:36:58,545
Oh, yeah?

1592
01:36:58,545 --> 01:36:58,612
No.

1593
01:36:58,612 --> 01:37:02,249
He would like
the harriet i see.

1594
01:37:02,316 --> 01:37:06,754
The true harriet.
La vraie.

1595
01:37:06,820 --> 01:37:09,322
The one
who is gentle.

1596
01:37:09,389 --> 01:37:11,091
Not afraid to play.

1597
01:37:11,158 --> 01:37:13,561
Not afraid to love.

1598
01:37:15,428 --> 01:37:17,431
Not afraid to trust.

1599
01:37:25,772 --> 01:37:29,876
The real harriet
would dance...

1600
01:37:29,943 --> 01:37:33,414
With a clumsy frenchman...
if he asked her?

1601
01:40:03,229 --> 01:40:06,533
It's time
to bring albert back.

1602
01:40:06,599 --> 01:40:09,069
Tell him you see me.

1603
01:40:49,943 --> 01:40:51,878
Albert?

1604
01:40:51,945 --> 01:40:53,547
Hey, albert?

1605
01:40:53,614 --> 01:40:55,548
I saw him.

1606
01:40:55,615 --> 01:40:57,117
Albert?

1607
01:40:58,618 --> 01:40:59,787
Albert!

1608
01:41:11,531 --> 01:41:14,901
Albert!

1609
01:41:14,967 --> 01:41:16,303
God.

1610
01:41:21,474 --> 01:41:22,742
Albert.

1611
01:41:22,809 --> 01:41:24,478
I'm coming, boy.

1612
01:41:50,003 --> 01:41:51,471
Albert?

1613
01:41:51,538 --> 01:41:52,473
Albert.

1614
01:41:56,009 --> 01:41:57,344
Albert?

1615
01:41:59,846 --> 01:42:01,614
Come on,
take my hand.

1616
01:42:01,681 --> 01:42:03,116
Come on.

1617
01:42:15,095 --> 01:42:16,663
Albert?

1618
01:42:16,729 --> 01:42:18,098
Go to harriet.

1619
01:42:18,165 --> 01:42:19,633
Come on, albert.

1620
01:42:19,700 --> 01:42:21,401
I'm right here.

1621
01:42:22,769 --> 01:42:23,836
Ugh!

1622
01:42:23,903 --> 01:42:25,038
Albert!

1623
01:42:29,042 --> 01:42:31,144
You can do it.
Go on.

1624
01:42:31,210 --> 01:42:33,213
That's right.

1625
01:42:33,280 --> 01:42:34,982
That's it.

1626
01:42:35,048 --> 01:42:37,884
Go on, albert.
Take her hand. Reach.

1627
01:42:37,951 --> 01:42:39,219
Come on.

1628
01:42:39,286 --> 01:42:42,289
Take her hand.
You can do it.

1629
01:42:42,355 --> 01:42:44,257
Take my hand.

1630
01:42:44,324 --> 01:42:45,724
Come on.
You can do it, albert.

1631
01:42:45,792 --> 01:42:47,427
Come on, one more step.
Come on.

1632
01:42:48,762 --> 01:42:50,531
Don't be scared.

1633
01:42:50,597 --> 01:42:52,799
Come on. Yeah.

1634
01:42:52,866 --> 01:42:54,668
All right, i got you.

1635
01:42:54,734 --> 01:42:56,537
Come on, give me
your other hand.

1636
01:42:56,603 --> 01:42:57,570
Oh, all right.

1637
01:42:57,637 --> 01:43:00,106
Yeah. Yeah.

1638
01:43:00,173 --> 01:43:02,008
Oh, god.

1639
01:43:02,075 --> 01:43:04,010
Oh, my god.

1640
01:43:04,076 --> 01:43:11,919
Oh.

1641
01:43:17,590 --> 01:43:18,759
Oh.

1642
01:43:20,393 --> 01:43:23,830
Listen,
the next time you decide to run away,

1643
01:43:23,897 --> 01:43:26,800
Do it on
the ground, ok?

1644
01:43:26,867 --> 01:43:29,702
I don't want
to run away.

1645
01:43:29,769 --> 01:43:31,003
Good.

1646
01:43:31,070 --> 01:43:33,773
'Cause i don't
want you to.

1647
01:43:39,078 --> 01:43:41,715
Tell him
you want him here.

1648
01:43:41,782 --> 01:43:43,716
I want you here.

1649
01:43:43,783 --> 01:43:45,919
I need you.

1650
01:43:47,754 --> 01:43:50,056
I really need you.

1651
01:43:50,123 --> 01:43:52,726
Tell her
you need her, too.

1652
01:43:52,793 --> 01:43:54,294
I need you, too.

1653
01:43:55,795 --> 01:43:57,297
Good.

1654
01:43:57,364 --> 01:44:01,901
'Cause i want to try to
make us into a family, ok?

1655
01:44:01,969 --> 01:44:04,471
Tell her
you want that, too.

1656
01:44:06,306 --> 01:44:07,941
Me, too.

1657
01:44:10,276 --> 01:44:12,945
I'll try to be
a good mother.

1658
01:44:13,012 --> 01:44:14,548
That's pushing it.

1659
01:44:14,615 --> 01:44:16,249
I'll try.

1660
01:44:16,316 --> 01:44:18,318
You hungry?

1661
01:44:20,153 --> 01:44:21,688
Uh-Huh.

1662
01:44:21,755 --> 01:44:22,922
Good.

1663
01:44:22,989 --> 01:44:24,991
And now the soup.

1664
01:44:26,326 --> 01:44:27,661
Come on.

1665
01:44:29,162 --> 01:44:31,364
You know,
your mom did this to me once.

1666
01:44:31,431 --> 01:44:32,932
My mom ran away?

1667
01:44:32,999 --> 01:44:34,800
Yeah. She used
to run away all the time.

1668
01:44:34,868 --> 01:44:35,836
Really?

1669
01:45:28,288 --> 01:45:29,723
Come on, albert.

1670
01:45:29,790 --> 01:45:32,058
Let's go.

1671
01:45:32,124 --> 01:45:33,393
What are you doing?

1672
01:45:33,460 --> 01:45:35,195
You can't run
through a graveyard.

1673
01:45:35,262 --> 01:45:36,563
Stop, boy, stop!

1674
01:45:36,629 --> 01:45:37,597
Pow!

1675
01:45:37,664 --> 01:45:39,032
Got you.

1676
01:45:39,099 --> 01:45:43,703
I tried to be nice, albert,
but you wouldn't listen.

1677
01:45:45,104 --> 01:45:46,406
Got you.

1678
01:45:46,473 --> 01:45:48,875
Oh. I think you got me
through the heart.

1679
01:45:48,942 --> 01:45:51,244
That was
a good one, harriet!

1680
01:45:51,311 --> 01:45:52,545
Albert, slow down!

1681
01:45:52,612 --> 01:45:55,682
Come on, harriet!

1682
01:45:55,749 --> 01:45:57,117
Au revoir.

1683
01:45:59,319 --> 01:46:01,254
Well, it's funny.

1684
01:46:01,320 --> 01:46:03,889
When they need us,
we are there.

1685
01:46:03,957 --> 01:46:07,260
Big "hello,"
big "let's be friends

1686
01:46:07,326 --> 01:46:10,763
That never parts
forever and forever."

1687
01:46:10,830 --> 01:46:16,102
But when it's done...
poof! We disappear.

1688
01:46:16,169 --> 01:46:18,204
They never say good-Bye.

1689
01:46:18,270 --> 01:46:20,674
They never see us go.

1690
01:46:20,741 --> 01:46:24,778
Oh, sometimes
they remember us...later.

1691
01:46:24,845 --> 01:46:26,579
Maybe not.

1692
01:46:26,646 --> 01:46:30,016
But...i cannot complain.

1693
01:46:30,082 --> 01:46:33,286
It's my job, you know.

1694
01:46:40,193 --> 01:46:41,661
Whoo!

1695
01:46:47,200 --> 01:46:49,302

01:46:49,369 --> 01:46:53,673
