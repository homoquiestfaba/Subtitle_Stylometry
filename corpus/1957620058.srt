1
00:00:01,102 --> 00:00:04,105
(slow twangy music)

2
00:00:17,518 --> 00:00:20,254
- All right, pal,
 rise and shine.

3
00:00:21,422 --> 00:00:25,093
What do I look like,
 an alarm clock?

4
00:00:25,093 --> 00:00:26,360
Let's move.

5
00:00:26,360 --> 00:00:28,462
You're just askin'
 to get a whuppin'.

6
00:00:28,462 --> 00:00:31,865
Haven't even gotten
 my cup of coffee yet.

7
00:00:47,481 --> 00:00:48,816
Come on, let's go.

8
00:00:48,816 --> 00:00:49,950
Up, up.

9
00:00:49,950 --> 00:00:51,285
- What time is it?

10
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,154
- Don't give me that garbage.

11
00:00:53,154 --> 00:00:55,123
- Look, I'm just tryin'
to put a little sunshine

12
00:00:55,123 --> 00:00:56,590
in your life, Dinah.

13
00:00:56,590 --> 00:01:00,394
- Child, when I need
 sunshine, I'll ask for it.

14
00:01:02,196 --> 00:01:03,731
(hand knocking)

15
00:01:03,731 --> 00:01:04,565
- Yeah?

16
00:01:12,673 --> 00:01:15,943
- All right, Murell,
 it's your big day.

17
00:01:15,943 --> 00:01:17,311
Ready for your job assignment?

18
00:01:17,311 --> 00:01:20,414
- Yeah, let me guess,
 doctor, lawyer,

19
00:01:22,783 --> 00:01:24,051
game show host?

20
00:01:24,051 --> 00:01:25,319
(laughing) Let me
 see what you got.

21
00:01:25,319 --> 00:01:28,689
- Sorry, hon, they gave
those jobs out already.

22
00:01:28,689 --> 00:01:30,591
We just get the leftovers.

23
00:01:30,591 --> 00:01:32,593
- I'm a janitor.

24
00:01:32,593 --> 00:01:34,928
- Shouldn't be too tough for ya.

25
00:01:34,928 --> 00:01:37,097
Think you can handle it?

26
00:01:37,097 --> 00:01:38,699
- It's up a church.

27
00:01:39,833 --> 00:01:43,504
- That's right, now get
it together, Murell.

28
00:01:43,504 --> 00:01:45,673
We're counting on you.

29
00:01:45,673 --> 00:01:48,776
You've been at this
place for 3 1/2 months.

30
00:01:48,776 --> 00:01:51,212
- Four, counting rehab.

31
00:01:51,212 --> 00:01:53,814
- Whatever, four months.

32
00:01:53,814 --> 00:01:55,816
It's a big step for you.

33
00:01:56,984 --> 00:01:58,786
You ever held a job before?

34
00:01:58,786 --> 00:02:00,188
- No, not really.

35
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:04,725
The only job I was any
 good at was dealin'.

36
00:02:04,725 --> 00:02:07,060
- We sleep about 135 men here.

37
00:02:07,060 --> 00:02:10,298
Sometimes in the winter,
 we've had as many as 200,

38
00:02:10,298 --> 00:02:11,799
and we try to get
 as many of these men

39
00:02:11,799 --> 00:02:13,967
out into the
 community as possible

40
00:02:13,967 --> 00:02:16,337
so that they can
 get full-time jobs.

41
00:02:16,337 --> 00:02:17,871
And if you'll come
 with me, I'll show you

42
00:02:17,871 --> 00:02:21,809
the counseling center
 and the women's quarters.

43
00:02:21,809 --> 00:02:23,477
- Hey, I can see it.

44
00:02:31,319 --> 00:02:33,321
- Hi, my name is Murell.

45
00:02:36,824 --> 00:02:37,991
What's yours?

46
00:02:37,991 --> 00:02:39,593
- Come on, girls, let's go.
 - Amy.

47
00:02:39,593 --> 00:02:40,428
- Hi, Amy.

48
00:02:50,404 --> 00:02:52,139
- [Dinah Voiceover]
 God'll use your gifts.

49
00:02:52,139 --> 00:02:53,807
Just follow through
 on that commitment

50
00:02:53,807 --> 00:02:56,009
to Christ you made a
 couple of months ago.

51
00:02:56,009 --> 00:02:57,611
You gotta trust him.

52
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,747
He'll take care of the rest.

53
00:02:59,747 --> 00:03:01,482
You can do it, Murell.

54
00:03:01,482 --> 00:03:05,185
Now show these people what
 you got goin' for you.

55
00:03:05,185 --> 00:03:06,854
(slow twangy music)

56
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,088
- Stay up, now.

57
00:03:14,595 --> 00:03:18,332
- Keep your eyes on the
things above, Murell.

58
00:03:27,174 --> 00:03:28,175
- All right,

59
00:03:29,577 --> 00:03:33,213
last week we were talking
 about the Beatitudes.

60
00:03:33,213 --> 00:03:34,982
Any questions so far?

61
00:03:37,551 --> 00:03:38,986
Yeah.

62
00:03:38,986 --> 00:03:41,455
- Yeah, um, how much
 longer is this gonna take,

63
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,624
'cause I'm missing my MTV.

64
00:03:44,925 --> 00:03:47,328
- Okay, um, let's take a look

65
00:03:48,962 --> 00:03:52,132
at the passage in chapter five.

66
00:03:52,132 --> 00:03:53,967
What does he mean when he says,

67
00:03:53,967 --> 00:03:58,138
"Blessed are the meek for
 they shall inherit the earth?"

68
00:03:59,139 --> 00:03:59,973
No idea?

69
00:04:03,143 --> 00:04:03,977
Anybody?

70
00:04:07,114 --> 00:04:09,517
What's he talking about here?

71
00:04:11,385 --> 00:04:14,888
- He's just sayin'
that we should be meek.

72
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,292
- Okay.

73
00:04:20,428 --> 00:04:21,261
What else?

74
00:04:27,200 --> 00:04:29,703
Come on, we talked about this.

75
00:04:32,606 --> 00:04:35,275
(motor revving)

76
00:04:39,613 --> 00:04:40,448
- Check it out!

77
00:04:40,448 --> 00:04:41,515
It's a Ninja!

78
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,421
- Hey, guys, come on, sit down.

79
00:04:50,924 --> 00:04:53,827
All right, come on,
 let's finish up.

80
00:04:53,827 --> 00:04:55,829
Just a few more minutes.

81
00:05:00,100 --> 00:05:00,968
Okay, well,

82
00:05:03,804 --> 00:05:06,139
maybe it's time for a break.

83
00:05:10,944 --> 00:05:13,447
(sighs)

84
00:05:13,447 --> 00:05:16,116
(strings music)

85
00:05:26,326 --> 00:05:27,828
- [Man] Now, what
 are you planning

86
00:05:27,828 --> 00:05:29,563
for this section of the lot?

87
00:05:29,563 --> 00:05:31,565
- The rear entrance would
 be here, and there'll

88
00:05:31,565 --> 00:05:32,900
be plenty of room for parking.

89
00:05:32,900 --> 00:05:34,768
And the north annex
will be right over here.

90
00:05:34,768 --> 00:05:37,004
- And you want all
 this done by December?

91
00:05:37,004 --> 00:05:39,172
There's absolutely no way.

92
00:06:01,194 --> 00:06:02,563
- Need some help
with that, Jack?

93
00:06:02,563 --> 00:06:04,998
- Uh no, thanks, I've got it.

94
00:06:22,182 --> 00:06:24,084
- Now, I spoke with
Mr. Conroy, and he said

95
00:06:24,084 --> 00:06:26,086
there'd be no problem
 meeting the deadline.

96
00:06:26,086 --> 00:06:28,656
- Well, look, he obviously
 didn't realize the extent--

97
00:06:28,656 --> 00:06:31,391
(Murell sighing)

98
00:06:31,391 --> 00:06:34,394
Can I help you with something?

99
00:06:34,394 --> 00:06:37,230
- Hmm, I'm from
 the Thompson House

100
00:06:40,267 --> 00:06:41,435
shelter, here.

101
00:06:44,905 --> 00:06:48,876
- Oh yes, yes, of course,
 well, why didn't you say so?

102
00:06:48,876 --> 00:06:50,277
Linda mentioned you'd be coming.

103
00:06:50,277 --> 00:06:51,512
Linda?

104
00:06:51,512 --> 00:06:52,746
- [Linda] Yes.

105
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:54,448
- Linda, this is the
 man from the shelter.

106
00:06:54,448 --> 00:06:57,485
Um, I'm sorry,
 what is your name?

107
00:06:57,485 --> 00:06:59,587
- Murell, Murell Parsons.

108
00:07:00,988 --> 00:07:02,255
- Linda will you show
 Murell where the cleaning

109
00:07:02,255 --> 00:07:03,557
supplies are kept and
 just briefly acquaint

110
00:07:03,557 --> 00:07:04,792
him with his duties here?

111
00:07:04,792 --> 00:07:06,259
- Certainly.

112
00:07:06,259 --> 00:07:07,928
Oh, by the way, Howard asked
 me to give this to you.

113
00:07:07,928 --> 00:07:09,963
He said you should
 read it immediately.

114
00:07:09,963 --> 00:07:11,865
Oh. (laughing)
 - Thank you.

115
00:07:11,865 --> 00:07:13,901
- [Linda] He said it
 was very important.

116
00:07:13,901 --> 00:07:15,669
- Now, where were we?

117
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:20,007
- [Linda] You'd
 better read it now!

118
00:07:20,007 --> 00:07:22,743
- I'm sorry, would
 you excuse me?

119
00:07:33,521 --> 00:07:36,957
With this I submit my
 formal resignation?

120
00:07:40,694 --> 00:07:42,696
Hold on just one minute.

121
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:59,046
- Here it is,
everything you'll need.

122
00:07:59,046 --> 00:08:02,449
Oh, here is your weekly routine,

123
00:08:02,449 --> 00:08:05,118
and these are your work clothes.

124
00:08:10,891 --> 00:08:12,760
Oh, we'll have to fix that.

125
00:08:12,760 --> 00:08:15,095
What did you say
 your name was again?

126
00:08:15,095 --> 00:08:16,163
- Uh, Murell.

127
00:08:17,898 --> 00:08:21,969
- I don't think they have
 a label with that name.

128
00:08:26,139 --> 00:08:28,742
(gentle music)

129
00:08:41,188 --> 00:08:43,090
Ugh, somebody should've
water those things.

130
00:08:43,090 --> 00:08:44,825
They're in pretty bad shape.

131
00:08:44,825 --> 00:08:47,427
- No, actually they'll be fine,

132
00:08:48,562 --> 00:08:52,332
just need a little
 water, a little light.

133
00:08:52,332 --> 00:08:55,535
- I gave them some plant
food once, didn't help.

134
00:08:55,535 --> 00:08:59,740
- No, just give 'em
 light and some water,

135
00:08:59,740 --> 00:09:01,942
but only the proper amount.

136
00:09:03,343 --> 00:09:05,012
They just need love.

137
00:09:13,086 --> 00:09:15,989
(loud piano music)

138
00:09:47,587 --> 00:09:49,522
- Everything's set
 with the janitor.

139
00:09:49,522 --> 00:09:51,859
He's a bit of a strange one.

140
00:09:53,460 --> 00:09:56,129
Guess he's been waiting a while.

141
00:09:57,665 --> 00:09:59,767
By the way, the youth group
 is gathered downstairs

142
00:09:59,767 --> 00:10:02,335
right now, apparently,
 they're unsupervised.

143
00:10:02,335 --> 00:10:04,204
- Please, tell me you're joking?

144
00:10:04,204 --> 00:10:08,375
- Walter, don't forget your
 stress management techniques.

145
00:10:12,412 --> 00:10:14,414
- Hmm, what we got here?

146
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,719
Mop the floors, vacuuming,

147
00:10:22,155 --> 00:10:25,158
wash the windows,
 empty the garbage.

148
00:10:29,229 --> 00:10:31,398
Man, what am I doin' here?

149
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:43,143
(kids laughing)

150
00:10:50,250 --> 00:10:51,251
- [Boy] Yes!

151
00:11:00,227 --> 00:11:03,463
- Janitor, somebody spilled
 some drinks over there.

152
00:11:03,463 --> 00:11:05,532
Could you go clean it up?

153
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:29,289
- Couldn't anyone teach
these kids to clean

154
00:11:29,289 --> 00:11:30,791
up their own mess?

155
00:11:33,593 --> 00:11:37,230
- Hey man, why did you
become a janitor anyway?

156
00:11:37,230 --> 00:11:39,032
- 'Cause that's
 all he's good at.

157
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,968
Can't do anything else.

158
00:11:42,836 --> 00:11:45,338
- Oh, what makes you say that?

159
00:12:18,071 --> 00:12:20,473
(drum music)

160
00:13:10,891 --> 00:13:12,492
Oh, uh, sorry, sir.

161
00:13:14,294 --> 00:13:16,296
I was just about to um...

162
00:13:16,296 --> 00:13:19,900
- And perhaps you'd
better get right to it.

163
00:13:22,502 --> 00:13:24,838
- Nice playin', drummer boy.

164
00:13:33,413 --> 00:13:37,584
- Now, everyone, I have some
 disappointing news for you.

165
00:13:47,394 --> 00:13:49,462
- Man, I mean, I'm sorry.

166
00:14:06,246 --> 00:14:09,316
Um, I gotta get
 somethin', excuse me.

167
00:14:12,085 --> 00:14:12,920
Ugh.

168
00:14:17,424 --> 00:14:18,258
- Sorry.

169
00:14:25,933 --> 00:14:27,700
- [Man] Well, we
 lost another one.

170
00:14:27,700 --> 00:14:28,936
- Oh, no.
 - What's it gonna take

171
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,437
to get someone?
 - That's four now.

172
00:14:30,437 --> 00:14:32,739
- This is really costing us.
 - In what, about three years?

173
00:14:32,739 --> 00:14:34,707
- This one seven months.
- This is absolutely

174
00:14:34,707 --> 00:14:36,209
intolerable.

175
00:14:36,209 --> 00:14:38,045
Why exactly are they quitting?

176
00:14:38,045 --> 00:14:39,612
- [Board Member]
 Money, could it be?

177
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:42,349
- Walter, we've
 gotta do something.

178
00:14:42,349 --> 00:14:44,484
People are getting concerned.

179
00:14:44,484 --> 00:14:47,354
You know, I had a parent call
 me at 10 o'clock last night.

180
00:14:47,354 --> 00:14:50,690
- We can't just put the
youth program on hold.

181
00:14:50,690 --> 00:14:52,292
You know how these
 parents complain

182
00:14:52,292 --> 00:14:55,228
when their kids are sitting
 at home on Wednesday nights.

183
00:14:55,228 --> 00:14:56,930
- Well look, if we could
just put the youth group

184
00:14:56,930 --> 00:14:59,799
on a temporary hiatus
for a couple of months.

185
00:14:59,799 --> 00:15:01,601
I have a candidate
 all picked out.

186
00:15:01,601 --> 00:15:05,338
He's graduating with his
 Master's from Fuller in June.

187
00:15:05,338 --> 00:15:06,573
I've already screened him.

188
00:15:06,573 --> 00:15:08,575
He's the perfect choice.

189
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:18,718
- Sure, that's what you
said about the last one,

190
00:15:18,718 --> 00:15:20,287
and look how long
 he stuck around.

191
00:15:20,287 --> 00:15:23,756
- (laughing) Seven months!

192
00:15:23,756 --> 00:15:26,926
- Okay, okay, I know I've
 made some poor judgments

193
00:15:26,926 --> 00:15:30,463
in the past, but
 this guy is terrific.

194
00:15:30,463 --> 00:15:32,265
He has a gift for
 working with kids.

195
00:15:32,265 --> 00:15:34,034
- That's all well
 and good, Walter,

196
00:15:34,034 --> 00:15:36,303
but we can't afford
 to wait two months.

197
00:15:36,303 --> 00:15:39,039
We need a replacement right now.

198
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:41,574
It doesn't look good for
 a 500-member congregation

199
00:15:41,574 --> 00:15:43,977
to be lacking a youth pastor.

200
00:15:51,784 --> 00:15:54,854
(squeegee squeaking)

201
00:16:11,171 --> 00:16:14,007
- You're doing it wrong.

202
00:16:14,007 --> 00:16:14,841
Here.

203
00:16:42,269 --> 00:16:43,103
You'll do fine.

204
00:16:43,103 --> 00:16:44,404
Hang in there.

205
00:16:44,404 --> 00:16:46,973
(gentle music)

206
00:17:02,355 --> 00:17:03,623
- We'll give you till
 Friday to come up

207
00:17:03,623 --> 00:17:05,725
with a replacement, Walter.

208
00:17:05,725 --> 00:17:07,460
- And then what?

209
00:17:07,460 --> 00:17:08,795
- I don't know.

210
00:17:08,795 --> 00:17:11,164
I'm hoping we won't
 get to that point.

211
00:17:11,164 --> 00:17:14,000
(group muttering)

212
00:17:21,108 --> 00:17:23,676
(gentle music)

213
00:17:36,523 --> 00:17:38,558
- Hey, what are doin'?

214
00:17:38,558 --> 00:17:40,327
- What does it look
 like I'm doin'?

215
00:17:40,327 --> 00:17:41,494
- You go to this church?

216
00:17:41,494 --> 00:17:44,097
- Yeah, only because I have to.

217
00:17:46,866 --> 00:17:49,035
- Hey, you're pretty good.

218
00:17:50,637 --> 00:17:53,306
Here, let me show you something.

219
00:17:54,741 --> 00:17:55,575
Here.

220
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:58,345
- What?

221
00:17:58,345 --> 00:18:01,448
- I just wanted to
 show you somethin'.

222
00:18:55,001 --> 00:18:55,935
- Are you okay?

223
00:18:55,935 --> 00:18:57,904
- Whew, yeah, I'm all right.

224
00:18:57,904 --> 00:19:00,540
I was just tryin' to show
 you my backwards side flip.

225
00:19:00,540 --> 00:19:03,109
- You haven't been here
too long, have you?

226
00:19:03,109 --> 00:19:05,144
- No, about a week.

227
00:19:05,144 --> 00:19:06,846
- Were you a janitor
 somewhere else?

228
00:19:06,846 --> 00:19:09,015
- No, not really.

229
00:19:09,015 --> 00:19:10,383
- What did you do then?

230
00:19:10,383 --> 00:19:13,720
- I was living in a
 shelter in the city.

231
00:19:17,089 --> 00:19:18,225
- Oh.

232
00:19:18,225 --> 00:19:19,559
- Murell.

233
00:19:19,559 --> 00:19:21,294
- Oh, uh, sorry.

234
00:19:21,294 --> 00:19:24,130
I was just finishing
 up over here.

235
00:19:32,038 --> 00:19:34,341
- Murell, I wanted to
ask you a few questions.

236
00:19:34,341 --> 00:19:35,308
May I?

237
00:19:35,308 --> 00:19:36,709
- Sure, go ahead.

238
00:19:38,578 --> 00:19:40,880
- Have you ever worked
 with young people before?

239
00:19:40,880 --> 00:19:42,882
- Yeah, well, kinda.

240
00:19:42,882 --> 00:19:45,685
I used to help out at
the boys club sometimes.

241
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:47,320
- I see.

242
00:19:47,320 --> 00:19:49,889
Ever been in a leadership
 capacity of any kind?

243
00:19:49,889 --> 00:19:50,723
- No.

244
00:19:54,261 --> 00:19:56,796
- Ever have any Bible training?

245
00:19:56,796 --> 00:19:59,098
- Yeah, as a matter of fact,

246
00:20:00,433 --> 00:20:02,469
I took a correspondence
course once.

247
00:20:02,469 --> 00:20:03,303
- Hmm.

248
00:20:04,337 --> 00:20:05,605
Good.

249
00:20:05,605 --> 00:20:07,039
Anything beyond that?

250
00:20:07,039 --> 00:20:08,541
- [Murell] Uh, no.

251
00:20:10,009 --> 00:20:12,945
- Okay, that pretty
 much covers it.

252
00:20:15,248 --> 00:20:16,983
Here, let me do this.

253
00:20:23,523 --> 00:20:26,326
Murell, how would you
 feel about leading

254
00:20:26,326 --> 00:20:28,961
the church youth group?

255
00:20:28,961 --> 00:20:32,198
- Hmm, well, I'd really
have to think about it.

256
00:20:32,198 --> 00:20:34,601
- It's just temporary
 for a couple of months

257
00:20:34,601 --> 00:20:36,469
till we get our replacement.

258
00:20:36,469 --> 00:20:39,639
Give it some
 thought, sleep on it.

259
00:20:39,639 --> 00:20:41,974
Let me know what you decide.

260
00:20:43,175 --> 00:20:44,010
Sloane.

261
00:20:47,380 --> 00:20:50,850
Murell, I want you to
 meet my son Sloane.

262
00:20:50,850 --> 00:20:53,219
- Good to meet you, man.

263
00:20:53,219 --> 00:20:54,687
- Sloane's been involved
with the church.

264
00:20:54,687 --> 00:20:59,459
He used to be a staff
 leader of our Awana program.

265
00:20:59,459 --> 00:21:01,461
Sloane, would you finish
cleaning this up for me?

266
00:21:01,461 --> 00:21:02,395
- Dad, I have to go.

267
00:21:02,395 --> 00:21:03,630
Some friends are waiting for me.

268
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:05,231
- Look, I have a lot of
work to take care of.

269
00:21:05,231 --> 00:21:07,467
I don't have time to argue.

270
00:21:15,575 --> 00:21:18,745
- Hey, man, you don't
 have to do that.

271
00:21:20,380 --> 00:21:23,282
Let me--
- You don't understand.

272
00:21:23,282 --> 00:21:25,718
(slow music)

273
00:21:28,187 --> 00:21:29,622
I have no choice.

274
00:22:03,222 --> 00:22:04,256
- [Walter] Well,
 Murell, I'm glad you

275
00:22:04,256 --> 00:22:05,458
decided to come aboard.

276
00:22:05,458 --> 00:22:06,826
Let me give you a few pointers.

277
00:22:06,826 --> 00:22:08,027
- Okay.

278
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:09,462
- Remember, this is just
for a couple months,

279
00:22:09,462 --> 00:22:11,731
so don't do anything
 major, just keep 'em busy

280
00:22:11,731 --> 00:22:13,600
and don't make waves.

281
00:22:13,600 --> 00:22:15,968
I've got the board breathing
 down my neck as it is.

282
00:22:15,968 --> 00:22:17,069
That sound okay to you?

283
00:22:17,069 --> 00:22:18,971
- [Murell] I guess so.

284
00:22:18,971 --> 00:22:20,440
- You guess so?

285
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:21,474
Are you not sure?

286
00:22:21,474 --> 00:22:23,543
- No, it's fine.

287
00:22:23,543 --> 00:22:25,778
I'll just do my best.

288
00:22:25,778 --> 00:22:30,016
Besides, how hard can it be
 to lead a bunch of teenagers?

289
00:22:30,016 --> 00:22:32,952
- Of course, you'll
 do wonderfully.

290
00:22:34,954 --> 00:22:37,657
Can I have your
 attention, everyone?

291
00:22:37,657 --> 00:22:39,025
I'd like to introduce
 you to our new,

292
00:22:39,025 --> 00:22:42,729
interim youth leader,
 Murell Parsons.

293
00:22:42,729 --> 00:22:45,465
- [Boy] Hey, it's the janitor.

294
00:22:45,465 --> 00:22:47,099
- Murell, let me introduce
 you to just a few

295
00:22:47,099 --> 00:22:49,702
of our youth group members.

296
00:22:49,702 --> 00:22:51,538
This is Jenny Radwell,

297
00:22:52,739 --> 00:22:55,475
and right here, this is Sheldon.

298
00:22:55,475 --> 00:22:57,376
I'm sorry, what
 is your last name?

299
00:22:57,376 --> 00:22:58,445
- Yu.

300
00:22:58,445 --> 00:22:59,879
- Yu?

301
00:22:59,879 --> 00:23:00,980
Oh yes, I see.

302
00:23:02,682 --> 00:23:04,717
And of course, this
 is Philip Wotelli.

303
00:23:04,717 --> 00:23:05,718
- Just Phil.

304
00:23:07,620 --> 00:23:09,856
- And here's Bobby Simmons.

305
00:23:12,825 --> 00:23:15,562
And over here is my son Sloane.

306
00:23:15,562 --> 00:23:17,096
I'm sure he'll prove
 very helpful to you

307
00:23:17,096 --> 00:23:18,030
in leading the group.

308
00:23:18,030 --> 00:23:20,767
- Murell, is that a real name?

309
00:23:20,767 --> 00:23:24,403
- Oh, you don't wanna
 hear my real name.

310
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,307
- All right, Murell, I guess
 it's all yours from here.

311
00:23:28,307 --> 00:23:30,943
Now everyone, I trust
 you'll give Murell

312
00:23:30,943 --> 00:23:35,047
the cooperation and the
 respect that he deserves.

313
00:23:37,083 --> 00:23:39,886
- Okay, guys, follow me.

314
00:23:39,886 --> 00:23:42,288
(jazz music)

315
00:23:59,572 --> 00:24:02,842
(moves to gentle music)

316
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:08,180
Come on, guys.

317
00:24:11,450 --> 00:24:12,519
Don't be shy.

318
00:24:18,691 --> 00:24:21,327
It's just a tree
 for cryin' out loud.

319
00:24:21,327 --> 00:24:23,229
Come on, have some fun!

320
00:24:24,296 --> 00:24:26,799
Look, I'm not gonna force you.

321
00:24:43,449 --> 00:24:45,818
Okay, everybody, how
 you all doin' today?

322
00:24:45,818 --> 00:24:48,988
Today, we're gonna hear
a story about a man,

323
00:24:48,988 --> 00:24:51,958
a dude named Zeke, and
this was a long time ago

324
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:53,726
during the time of Jesus.

325
00:24:53,726 --> 00:24:55,895
Now, Zeke was a rich
 dude, 'cause he was

326
00:24:55,895 --> 00:24:57,697
the chief tax collector.

327
00:24:57,697 --> 00:24:59,832
Now, everybody hated the
tax dudes, 'cause they

328
00:24:59,832 --> 00:25:01,668
were always rippin'
 people off, see.

329
00:25:01,668 --> 00:25:05,504
So wherever Zeke went,
 people said sinner.

330
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:07,940
So one day, Jesus comes to town,

331
00:25:07,940 --> 00:25:10,977
and everybody went out
by the road to meet him.

332
00:25:10,977 --> 00:25:13,279
Jesus, he was real
 popular back then.

333
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:15,081
So Zeke goes out
 there to see him too,

334
00:25:15,081 --> 00:25:17,149
but Zeke goes out there,
and he's real short,

335
00:25:17,149 --> 00:25:21,721
like, if this was a movie, Danny
Devito'd probably play him.

336
00:25:21,721 --> 00:25:24,123
So Zeke, he wasn't that stupid.

337
00:25:24,123 --> 00:25:26,292
What he did was, he
 went over to a tree

338
00:25:26,292 --> 00:25:27,694
and climbed up on to
 it so he could see

339
00:25:27,694 --> 00:25:29,295
what was goin' on.

340
00:25:29,295 --> 00:25:31,798
Now, you can imagine how
 funny he looked up there,

341
00:25:31,798 --> 00:25:33,966
you know, peerin' out.

342
00:25:33,966 --> 00:25:37,236
So Jesus comes walkin'
 down the street,

343
00:25:37,236 --> 00:25:39,171
and everybody's pushin'
and tryin' to get

344
00:25:39,171 --> 00:25:43,342
close and everything, and
Jesus walks right over to Zeke,

345
00:25:45,111 --> 00:25:46,746
who's hangin' from the
 tree, probably ready

346
00:25:46,746 --> 00:25:49,081
to fall down by now.

347
00:25:49,081 --> 00:25:52,318
And Jesus says,
 "Hey, Zeke, tonight

348
00:25:52,318 --> 00:25:54,420
"I'm stayin' at your place."

349
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,922
And Zeke is blown away,
you know, 'cause this

350
00:25:55,922 --> 00:26:00,026
is a big honor, I mean, like
 the president comin' over.

351
00:26:00,026 --> 00:26:01,127
And all the other
 people, they're sayin'

352
00:26:01,127 --> 00:26:03,796
to themselves, "Sinner, sinner."

353
00:26:06,633 --> 00:26:10,269
Then, all of a sudden,
 if that's not enough,

354
00:26:10,269 --> 00:26:13,472
in front of the whole
 crowd, Zeke says,

355
00:26:13,472 --> 00:26:16,876
"Hey look, Jesus, I'm
 gonna give away half

356
00:26:16,876 --> 00:26:18,845
"of everything I own,
 and I'm gonna pay

357
00:26:18,845 --> 00:26:21,413
"back everybody I ever cheated."

358
00:26:21,413 --> 00:26:23,916
But Jesus gets up, he looks
 him straight in the eye,

359
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:26,085
and you know what he says?

360
00:26:27,386 --> 00:26:31,190
He says, "Zeke, today,
salvation has come to this place

361
00:26:33,660 --> 00:26:37,163
"because the son of man
has come to seek out

362
00:26:37,163 --> 00:26:39,098
"and save what's lost."

363
00:26:40,232 --> 00:26:43,736
And everybody's stunned,
'cause this is Zeke

364
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:46,172
who Jesus is talkin' about.

365
00:26:46,172 --> 00:26:48,374
I mean, he was no holy dude.

366
00:26:48,374 --> 00:26:52,011
So what happened that
day was kind of amazing,

367
00:26:52,011 --> 00:26:55,347
so listen, because
 maybe Jesus is tryin'

368
00:26:57,283 --> 00:27:00,586
to say something to
one of you while you're

369
00:27:00,586 --> 00:27:03,856
sitting up in a tree somewhere.

370
00:27:03,856 --> 00:27:05,725
Okay, guys, meeting's over.

371
00:27:05,725 --> 00:27:07,126
See ya next time.

372
00:27:12,364 --> 00:27:14,366
- I know, it's weird.

373
00:27:14,366 --> 00:27:16,035
- Yeah, it is weird.

374
00:27:18,771 --> 00:27:20,272
- Well, what do you think?

375
00:27:20,272 --> 00:27:21,607
- That's guy's strange.

376
00:27:21,607 --> 00:27:23,175
He's way out there.

377
00:27:24,176 --> 00:27:25,011
- Yup.

378
00:27:28,815 --> 00:27:31,383
- So how was the meeting today?

379
00:27:31,383 --> 00:27:34,453
- It was okay, kinda
 weird, actually.

380
00:27:37,123 --> 00:27:41,127
That guy, that Murell guy
 took us up into a tree

381
00:27:42,228 --> 00:27:44,430
and told us a story.

382
00:27:44,430 --> 00:27:45,664
- He had you climb a tree?

383
00:27:45,664 --> 00:27:48,200
- Yeah, and then
 he told us a story.

384
00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:50,903
I guess it was supposed
to be about Zaccheus.

385
00:27:50,903 --> 00:27:53,505
Anyways, it was strange.

386
00:27:53,505 --> 00:27:55,474
- Climbing a tree,
 that sounds like fun.

387
00:27:55,474 --> 00:27:56,743
- Yeah, well, what do you know?

388
00:27:56,743 --> 00:27:58,610
- It sounds dangerous.

389
00:27:58,610 --> 00:28:01,080
He'll have to be more aware
 of insurance regulations.

390
00:28:01,080 --> 00:28:03,082
- Where did you
 get this guy from?

391
00:28:03,082 --> 00:28:04,650
Didn't he use to be the janitor?

392
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:06,753
- Well, I took a chance.

393
00:28:06,753 --> 00:28:09,889
It was kind of an experiment,

394
00:28:09,889 --> 00:28:12,624
but I'm getting
 a little worried.

395
00:28:14,626 --> 00:28:16,662
Why don't you keep
 an eye on him?

396
00:28:16,662 --> 00:28:19,598
Try to keep him on
 the right track.

397
00:28:21,968 --> 00:28:22,802
Sloane.

398
00:28:24,203 --> 00:28:28,040
- [Woman] Sloane, your
 father is talking to you.

399
00:28:31,944 --> 00:28:36,382
- All right, we got Youth
 Sunday comin' up here.

400
00:28:36,382 --> 00:28:40,552
That means we take over
 the whole mornin' service,

401
00:28:41,854 --> 00:28:44,690
the sermon, music,
 the whole deal.

402
00:28:47,326 --> 00:28:49,161
Now, help me out here.

403
00:28:51,563 --> 00:28:54,100
You know I've never
 done this before.

404
00:28:54,100 --> 00:28:56,268
And you guys are pros, so.

405
00:29:00,039 --> 00:29:03,075
Don't everybody jump
 up at once here.

406
00:29:04,376 --> 00:29:06,445
- How 'bout if we just
 sing a bunch of hymns

407
00:29:06,445 --> 00:29:07,980
like we did last year?

408
00:29:07,980 --> 00:29:11,851
- You know, Phil, I got
an even better idea.

409
00:29:11,851 --> 00:29:15,654
Why don't you be in charge
 of music for the service?

410
00:29:15,654 --> 00:29:17,123
(Phil scoffs)

411
00:29:17,123 --> 00:29:19,959
I don't know what's
 up with you guys.

412
00:29:19,959 --> 00:29:23,629
Why does everything
have to be so difficult?

413
00:29:25,564 --> 00:29:26,899
This ain't hard.

414
00:29:28,067 --> 00:29:30,870
It could be a lotta
 fun, a lotta fun.

415
00:29:33,205 --> 00:29:35,207
So why not Phil?

416
00:29:35,207 --> 00:29:36,042
Go for it.

417
00:29:37,076 --> 00:29:38,744
Show us what ya got.

418
00:29:39,745 --> 00:29:40,579
- Well,

419
00:29:43,382 --> 00:29:44,216
okay.

420
00:29:44,216 --> 00:29:45,217
- All right.

421
00:29:46,418 --> 00:29:50,156
Now, who's gonna handle
the sermon part of this?

422
00:29:52,391 --> 00:29:54,961
Sloane, why not give it a shot?

423
00:30:01,233 --> 00:30:02,701
- No, thanks.

424
00:30:02,701 --> 00:30:04,570
- Are you sure?

425
00:30:04,570 --> 00:30:06,973
I think you'd do a great job.

426
00:30:08,207 --> 00:30:09,976
- No, I'd rather not.

427
00:30:11,844 --> 00:30:15,781
- Look, your dad told me that
 you'd help me out a little--

428
00:30:15,781 --> 00:30:17,783
- I said I didn't want to!

429
00:30:17,783 --> 00:30:19,451
Just leave me alone!

430
00:30:26,993 --> 00:30:30,162
- Saul, Saul, why
 do you persecute me?

431
00:30:31,163 --> 00:30:32,999
- Where are you, Lord?

432
00:30:32,999 --> 00:30:34,533
- [Boy] The Lord Jesus,
who appeared to you

433
00:30:34,533 --> 00:30:36,202
on the road sent me.

434
00:30:38,637 --> 00:30:39,872
- I can see!

435
00:30:39,872 --> 00:30:41,640
I can see, I can see!

436
00:30:42,942 --> 00:30:46,145
(audience applauding)

437
00:30:54,053 --> 00:30:57,456
- Okay, folks, we're gonna do
 a little singing here today,

438
00:30:57,456 --> 00:31:00,626
and we're gonna need a little
 audience participation.

439
00:31:00,626 --> 00:31:04,263
Now, do your best just
 to follow along here.

440
00:31:07,033 --> 00:31:11,170
* And now that you're alive

441
00:31:11,170 --> 00:31:15,441
* You will need
 something to die for

442
00:31:15,441 --> 00:31:19,611
* Dig a hole in the ground
 and give it back to the sky

443
00:31:21,480 --> 00:31:23,315
* We all need love

444
00:31:23,315 --> 00:31:26,318
* We all need love

445
00:31:26,318 --> 00:31:29,488
- Isn't that Sloane
 Barker over there?

446
00:31:30,689 --> 00:31:33,259
I thought he wasn't
 gonna do the sermon?

447
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:36,662
- He changed his mind
 at the last minute.

448
00:31:49,275 --> 00:31:51,343
- I wanted to come speak
today on some things

449
00:31:51,343 --> 00:31:54,746
from the Bible, but
 I don't think I will.

450
00:31:58,517 --> 00:32:00,786
Instead I'd just like to say

451
00:32:04,756 --> 00:32:07,326
I really can't stand this place.

452
00:32:07,326 --> 00:32:09,095
(congregation murmurs)

453
00:32:09,095 --> 00:32:11,363
I've never known people who

454
00:32:14,700 --> 00:32:18,604
were more false than the
people at this church.

455
00:32:20,439 --> 00:32:22,708
Our world is falling apart.

456
00:32:24,710 --> 00:32:28,414
We've got holes in
 the ozone layer,

457
00:32:28,414 --> 00:32:31,250
nuclear bombs and
 people starving,

458
00:32:33,552 --> 00:32:37,056
and all you're concerned
about is building

459
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:41,927
another addition or
 getting a bigger offering.

460
00:32:43,029 --> 00:32:45,931
It makes me wonder
sometimes if there's any

461
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:49,101
point in believing
 in God or the Bible

462
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,442
or faith or the
 devil or anything.

463
00:33:04,650 --> 00:33:06,652
What's really the point?

464
00:33:09,188 --> 00:33:12,758
That's what I'm not
really sure of anymore.

465
00:33:28,207 --> 00:33:29,975
- Where is he?

466
00:33:29,975 --> 00:33:30,809
Sloane?

467
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:33,579
- I think he went to
his girlfriend's house.

468
00:33:33,579 --> 00:33:36,082
- Girlfriend, what girlfriend?

469
00:33:52,398 --> 00:33:53,232
- Hey ah,

470
00:33:58,637 --> 00:34:00,472
you got the time, man?

471
00:34:00,472 --> 00:34:01,673
- Uh no, sorry.

472
00:34:10,749 --> 00:34:13,419
- Hey, I know you, man.

473
00:34:13,419 --> 00:34:15,187
You're Murell, right?

474
00:34:16,122 --> 00:34:17,289
- Yeah, right.

475
00:34:18,457 --> 00:34:19,625
- Hey, how you doin', man?

476
00:34:19,625 --> 00:34:21,927
I haven't seen you in a while.

477
00:34:21,927 --> 00:34:23,229
- I'm doin' all right.

478
00:34:23,229 --> 00:34:24,396
What are you doin' out here?

479
00:34:24,396 --> 00:34:27,466
- Business, man,
 wherever it takes me.

480
00:34:29,168 --> 00:34:30,836
Speaking of which...

481
00:34:34,773 --> 00:34:37,676
You used to be one of
 my regular customers.

482
00:34:37,676 --> 00:34:39,578
Used to be pretty wild.

483
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:41,713
Used to be pretty--

484
00:34:41,713 --> 00:34:43,415
- Yeah, well, I don't
 do that stuff no more.

485
00:34:43,415 --> 00:34:46,051
It screws up your brain.

486
00:34:46,051 --> 00:34:49,688
- [Man In Hat] Uh huh, so
 why you out here, Murell?

487
00:34:49,688 --> 00:34:51,290
- 'Cause I work here.

488
00:34:51,290 --> 00:34:53,659
- Yeah, what do you do?

489
00:34:53,659 --> 00:34:57,196
- I work for a church,
 with teenagers.

490
00:34:57,196 --> 00:34:58,397
- Sounds good.

491
00:34:58,397 --> 00:34:59,631
How's it goin'?

492
00:35:00,532 --> 00:35:02,134
- Not so great right now.

493
00:35:02,134 --> 00:35:04,069
- Oh, work got ya down?

494
00:35:04,069 --> 00:35:06,172
- No, it's just one of the kids.

495
00:35:06,172 --> 00:35:08,507
I'm kinda worried about him.

496
00:35:09,675 --> 00:35:13,545
- Hmm, sounds like you
could use a little lift.

497
00:35:17,549 --> 00:35:18,384
Here.

498
00:35:24,490 --> 00:35:25,324
Take it.

499
00:35:26,892 --> 00:35:28,427
- No.

500
00:35:28,427 --> 00:35:29,695
- Take it.

501
00:35:29,695 --> 00:35:31,330
You may need it someday.

502
00:35:31,330 --> 00:35:32,164
- [Murell] That's okay, man.

503
00:35:32,164 --> 00:35:33,165
- No charge.

504
00:36:00,226 --> 00:36:02,994
(dangerous music)

505
00:36:24,049 --> 00:36:26,218
- [Murell] Come on,
 everybody, gather 'round here.

506
00:36:26,218 --> 00:36:27,986
- [Phil] What are we doin' now?

507
00:36:27,986 --> 00:36:30,922
- I just wanna teach
 you guys somethin'.

508
00:36:30,922 --> 00:36:32,558
See this stuff?

509
00:36:32,558 --> 00:36:34,360
It's called yeast.

510
00:36:34,360 --> 00:36:35,894
- I think we know that.

511
00:36:35,894 --> 00:36:37,396
- Good.

512
00:36:37,396 --> 00:36:39,665
You guys are pretty
 sharp, but do you know

513
00:36:39,665 --> 00:36:42,701
what happens when you put
 yeast in a loaf of bread?

514
00:36:42,701 --> 00:36:43,902
- It rises.

515
00:36:43,902 --> 00:36:45,404
- Right!

516
00:36:45,404 --> 00:36:49,341
It gets bigger and bigger,
 expands and everything.

517
00:36:52,177 --> 00:36:56,014
And you end up with a
great big loaf of bread.

518
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:02,854
You see, the kingdom
of heaven is like that.

519
00:37:02,854 --> 00:37:06,658
You start out with this
little bitty thing,

520
00:37:06,658 --> 00:37:09,661
and it grows up
 into something huge.

521
00:37:12,798 --> 00:37:15,200
Here, Phil, try some.

522
00:37:15,200 --> 00:37:16,635
- Nah, that's all right.

523
00:37:16,635 --> 00:37:17,469
- What's the matter?

524
00:37:17,469 --> 00:37:18,837
This stuff is great.

525
00:37:18,837 --> 00:37:20,038
You gotta try it.

526
00:37:20,038 --> 00:37:21,907
- That's all right,
 I'm not hungry.

527
00:37:21,907 --> 00:37:23,375
- Come on.

528
00:37:23,375 --> 00:37:26,878
This is my prize
 creation, special recipe.

529
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,048
How about you, Sheldon?

530
00:37:30,048 --> 00:37:31,583
- No, thanks.

531
00:37:31,583 --> 00:37:33,018
We saw what you put in it.

532
00:37:33,018 --> 00:37:36,988
- Come on, that's just
 seasoning, gives it flavor.

533
00:37:38,056 --> 00:37:40,792
Come on, man, try it, why not?

534
00:37:40,792 --> 00:37:44,195
Don't be afraid,
it's just bread.

535
00:37:44,195 --> 00:37:46,298
It tastes real good.

536
00:37:46,298 --> 00:37:47,132
Trust me.

537
00:37:56,041 --> 00:37:56,942
- It tastes

538
00:37:58,710 --> 00:37:59,711
different.

539
00:37:59,711 --> 00:38:01,380
- All right, there you go.

540
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:03,048
What did I tell you?

541
00:38:05,384 --> 00:38:07,486
- This is an absolute joke.

542
00:38:07,486 --> 00:38:08,520
They need somebody
 for the youth group

543
00:38:08,520 --> 00:38:10,356
so they get the janitor?

544
00:38:10,356 --> 00:38:11,189
Come on.

545
00:38:12,658 --> 00:38:14,726
- I think he's pretty
 good, actually,

546
00:38:14,726 --> 00:38:16,328
a lot better than
 the other ones.

547
00:38:16,328 --> 00:38:18,764
- You know what Phil found out?

548
00:38:18,764 --> 00:38:20,265
The guy used to be
 a street person.

549
00:38:20,265 --> 00:38:22,501
He used to be a bum.

550
00:38:22,501 --> 00:38:26,572
How 'bout that, a bum
 for a youth pastor?

551
00:38:26,572 --> 00:38:28,740
- Well, so what if he's a bum?

552
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:31,610
He's the first person that
 actually cared about his job.

553
00:38:31,610 --> 00:38:35,414
You know, I'm beginning to
 think that you hate everybody.

554
00:38:35,414 --> 00:38:36,915
- That's not true.

555
00:38:39,117 --> 00:38:41,787
I care about you, you know that.

556
00:38:44,356 --> 00:38:46,291
- Yeah, but--

557
00:38:46,291 --> 00:38:48,894
- Look, it's gonna be all right.

558
00:38:48,894 --> 00:38:50,496
Remember our plans?

559
00:38:52,764 --> 00:38:55,634
We're gonna get
 out of this place.

560
00:38:55,634 --> 00:38:57,469
I made some reservations.

561
00:38:57,469 --> 00:39:00,906
It's a two-day trip
 by bus to Los Angeles.

562
00:39:10,649 --> 00:39:12,418
- Where have you been?

563
00:39:12,418 --> 00:39:13,385
- I've been out.

564
00:39:13,385 --> 00:39:14,219
- Sloane.

565
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,154
Sloane, we have to talk.

566
00:39:16,154 --> 00:39:17,656
- Talk about what?

567
00:39:17,656 --> 00:39:19,658
The miserable existence I've
 led for the past 17 years!

568
00:39:19,658 --> 00:39:22,027
- You have not had a
 miserable existence.

569
00:39:22,027 --> 00:39:23,562
You've had all your
 needs provided for.

570
00:39:23,562 --> 00:39:24,796
- I'm tired of playing
 all sorts of games

571
00:39:24,796 --> 00:39:27,599
at church to try to
measure up to something!

572
00:39:27,599 --> 00:39:30,001
I'm sick of being your
 little pastor's son!

573
00:39:30,001 --> 00:39:31,236
- Your mother and I--

574
00:39:31,236 --> 00:39:32,504
- And I'm not something
you can parade around!

575
00:39:32,504 --> 00:39:34,239
- Your mother and I
have tried, and we have

576
00:39:34,239 --> 00:39:36,374
done our best, and
 what do you do?

577
00:39:36,374 --> 00:39:37,576
You spit in our faces!

578
00:39:37,576 --> 00:39:38,777
- No one should have
 - You've made us

579
00:39:38,777 --> 00:39:39,545
- to go through this!
 - a laughingstock!

580
00:39:39,545 --> 00:39:40,779
- I watched you!

581
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:42,047
Paul and I had to sit
 there through every

582
00:39:42,047 --> 00:39:43,815
sermon, all those
 sappy altar calls

583
00:39:43,815 --> 00:39:45,316
and every time you
 twisted those people's

584
00:39:45,316 --> 00:39:46,518
arms for more money!

585
00:39:46,518 --> 00:39:47,753
- Well, I can't believe
you're sayin' this!

586
00:39:47,753 --> 00:39:48,987
I don't know what
 has gotten into you!

587
00:39:48,987 --> 00:39:50,055
- Do you remember the
time we went to the mall

588
00:39:50,055 --> 00:39:51,322
and you bought that suit?

589
00:39:51,322 --> 00:39:52,991
It was right after you
 became head pastor.

590
00:39:52,991 --> 00:39:54,993
And we all went and
 we waited and waited

591
00:39:54,993 --> 00:39:56,495
while you tried on
 all these suits,

592
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,263
probably every suit
 in the stupid store!

593
00:39:58,263 --> 00:39:59,465
- What in the world?

594
00:39:59,465 --> 00:40:00,632
I have no idea what
you're blabberin' about.

595
00:40:00,632 --> 00:40:02,468
- Of course you
 don't, you never did.

596
00:40:02,468 --> 00:40:04,035
The point is you were
 always more concerned

597
00:40:04,035 --> 00:40:06,772
with looking good than things
 that were really important!

598
00:40:06,772 --> 00:40:08,239
- You just wait here, young man.

599
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:09,340
We're not finished.
 - I'm just glad I won't be

600
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:11,610
around here much longer.

601
00:40:11,610 --> 00:40:13,278
- [Phil] Let's
 play another game.

602
00:40:13,278 --> 00:40:16,114
- Nah, I don't
 wanna play anymore.

603
00:40:19,885 --> 00:40:21,953
- Hey guys, what's up?

604
00:40:21,953 --> 00:40:23,421
- Hey, where ya goin'?

605
00:40:23,421 --> 00:40:27,225
- I'm about to visit an old
friend of mine in the hospital.

606
00:40:29,027 --> 00:40:30,929
You guys wanna join me?

607
00:40:30,929 --> 00:40:31,797
- Nope, I can't.

608
00:40:31,797 --> 00:40:33,264
Gotta be somewhere.

609
00:40:33,264 --> 00:40:36,301
- Come on, Sloane, take
a break, go with us.

610
00:40:36,301 --> 00:40:39,905
Sloane, I really would
 like you to meet this guy.

611
00:40:39,905 --> 00:40:43,108
I mean, he's a good
 friend of mine.

612
00:40:43,108 --> 00:40:47,245
Would you do this
 just as a favor to me?

613
00:40:47,245 --> 00:40:48,947
Do you really have
 to go somewhere?

614
00:40:48,947 --> 00:40:52,918
- Yeah, I have to get
 some laundry done.

615
00:40:52,918 --> 00:40:55,754
- Come on. (laughing)

616
00:40:55,754 --> 00:40:57,523
You can put that off.

617
00:41:01,426 --> 00:41:02,928
- Okay, all right.

618
00:41:04,530 --> 00:41:06,031
- Great, let's go.

619
00:41:16,241 --> 00:41:18,109
We're here to see Ray.

620
00:41:18,109 --> 00:41:20,345
- Oh, that's nice.

621
00:41:20,345 --> 00:41:22,648
Are your friends here
 to see him as well?

622
00:41:22,648 --> 00:41:23,481
- Yes.

623
00:41:25,083 --> 00:41:27,753
- I'll need them to sign in too.

624
00:41:30,421 --> 00:41:34,192
All of you will need to
put these on before you

625
00:41:34,192 --> 00:41:37,428
go in to see Ray,
 and only a few of you

626
00:41:38,997 --> 00:41:40,666
can go in at a time.

627
00:41:41,867 --> 00:41:45,236
- Wait a minute, what
 do we need these for?

628
00:41:45,236 --> 00:41:48,740
- Look, guys, Ray's a
 good friend of mine,

629
00:41:50,542 --> 00:41:52,043
and he's got AIDS.

630
00:41:53,378 --> 00:41:55,413
- I can't believe this.

631
00:41:55,413 --> 00:41:56,948
How come you didn't say?

632
00:41:56,948 --> 00:42:00,786
- Look, I'm sorry, I should
 have mentioned it before.

633
00:42:00,786 --> 00:42:04,790
But Ray's really down right
now, and he needs some support.

634
00:42:04,790 --> 00:42:05,891
I just thought you
 guys might want to be

635
00:42:05,891 --> 00:42:08,126
there for him a little bit.

636
00:42:09,094 --> 00:42:10,495
- That's it, man, I'm leaving.

637
00:42:10,495 --> 00:42:12,397
I can't deal with this.

638
00:42:18,003 --> 00:42:21,072
- Are the rest of
 you still going in?

639
00:42:30,949 --> 00:42:33,518
(gentle music)

640
00:42:45,396 --> 00:42:48,133
- Hey, brother,
 what's happening?

641
00:42:50,936 --> 00:42:52,103
- Hey, Murell.

642
00:42:56,808 --> 00:42:58,677
- Are these the
 kids from church?

643
00:42:58,677 --> 00:43:01,713
- Yeah, this over here is Phil.

644
00:43:01,713 --> 00:43:03,281
That's Heather.

645
00:43:03,281 --> 00:43:06,251
That's Sheldon, Shell-it babe.

646
00:43:06,251 --> 00:43:08,253
My man Sloane and Jenny.

647
00:43:09,721 --> 00:43:12,257
- Oh, this is really great.

648
00:43:12,257 --> 00:43:14,525
I don't get too many visitors.

649
00:43:14,525 --> 00:43:18,196
Tell me, how is this
guy for a youth leader?

650
00:43:21,432 --> 00:43:23,034
- He's all right.

651
00:43:23,034 --> 00:43:25,637
He's pretty good, actually.

652
00:43:25,637 --> 00:43:29,641
- Well, that's cool. (coughing)

653
00:43:31,076 --> 00:43:34,846
Could you, could you
get me a glass of water?

654
00:43:36,314 --> 00:43:38,383
It's over there on the...

655
00:43:57,368 --> 00:43:58,436
Thanks a lot.

656
00:45:08,506 --> 00:45:10,508
- Sloane, you all right?

657
00:45:12,543 --> 00:45:13,779
You okay?

658
00:45:13,779 --> 00:45:15,313
- That was pretty
 sick, you know that?

659
00:45:15,313 --> 00:45:17,048
- What do you mean?

660
00:45:17,048 --> 00:45:19,450
- This whole little trip
was pretty disgusting.

661
00:45:19,450 --> 00:45:21,853
- I'm sorry you feel
 that way, Sloane.

662
00:45:21,853 --> 00:45:24,122
But I thought you guys
 might learn something.

663
00:45:24,122 --> 00:45:25,656
- Learn something?

664
00:45:25,656 --> 00:45:28,226
How did you come up with a
 perverted idea like that?

665
00:45:28,226 --> 00:45:30,461
It's just sick, taking
 us to see one of your

666
00:45:30,461 --> 00:45:32,730
AIDS-infested friends.

667
00:45:32,730 --> 00:45:34,232
What kind of youth
 pastor are you?

668
00:45:34,232 --> 00:45:36,234
- Sloane, you may not
realize it, but that man

669
00:45:36,234 --> 00:45:38,804
in there needs some help.

670
00:45:38,804 --> 00:45:40,305
He has no one.

671
00:45:40,305 --> 00:45:45,076
His own family's dumped him,
 therefore, we are his family.

672
00:45:45,076 --> 00:45:46,644
You understand?

673
00:45:46,644 --> 00:45:48,847
- You're really
 disturbed, you know that?

674
00:45:48,847 --> 00:45:51,216
Why did you even
 come here anyways?

675
00:45:51,216 --> 00:45:53,952
Why did you decide
 to be a youth pastor?

676
00:45:53,952 --> 00:45:56,254
Why don't you just go back
 to where you came from

677
00:45:56,254 --> 00:45:57,856
and leave us alone?

678
00:45:59,324 --> 00:46:00,658
- I just thought
 you should be aware,

679
00:46:00,658 --> 00:46:02,427
the youth leader took
 some of the teenagers

680
00:46:02,427 --> 00:46:05,430
to see an AIDS victim yesterday.

681
00:46:05,430 --> 00:46:08,934
Some of the parents
 are getting concerned.

682
00:46:10,735 --> 00:46:12,203
- Do a lot of people
 know about this?

683
00:46:12,203 --> 00:46:13,805
- I don't really know.

684
00:46:13,805 --> 00:46:16,174
But word is spreading.

685
00:46:16,174 --> 00:46:18,676
I heard it from the
 organist myself.

686
00:46:18,676 --> 00:46:21,479
- (sighs) Oh, great.

687
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:25,483
Well, if the organist
 knows, then everybody knows.

688
00:46:25,483 --> 00:46:28,219
I just hope this doesn't
blow out of control.

689
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:30,555
- I hope not, for your sake.

690
00:46:34,359 --> 00:46:38,463
- Excuse me, Murell, may
I speak with you please?

691
00:46:40,966 --> 00:46:42,800
- [Murell] What is it?

692
00:46:43,969 --> 00:46:46,671
- Murell, we have
 a real problem.

693
00:46:48,773 --> 00:46:50,775
Did you take the
 youth group to visit

694
00:46:50,775 --> 00:46:53,344
a person infected with AIDS?

695
00:46:53,344 --> 00:46:56,948
- Yes, but it was
 outside of the church.

696
00:46:56,948 --> 00:46:58,816
They came on their own.

697
00:46:58,816 --> 00:47:02,353
- It doesn't matter, Murell,
 the same rules apply.

698
00:47:02,353 --> 00:47:03,588
- Why?

699
00:47:03,588 --> 00:47:05,857
Is there a problem?

700
00:47:05,857 --> 00:47:09,961
- Murell, we have a major
 crisis on our hands.

701
00:47:09,961 --> 00:47:12,864
You and I could
 both lose our jobs.

702
00:47:14,632 --> 00:47:16,534
This church could be
 faced with a lawsuit.

703
00:47:16,534 --> 00:47:19,570
- Sir, what if I made an
apology on behalf of--

704
00:47:19,570 --> 00:47:21,139
- That wouldn't do anything.

705
00:47:21,139 --> 00:47:23,841
It'd probably make things worse.

706
00:47:23,841 --> 00:47:25,843
Did you ever think about
 getting permission slips?

707
00:47:25,843 --> 00:47:27,645
Did that thought
 ever occur to you?

708
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,780
- No, sir, I guess not.

709
00:47:29,780 --> 00:47:32,483
- You should have at least
 checked with me ahead of time.

710
00:47:32,483 --> 00:47:34,419
Here's what you're gonna do.

711
00:47:34,419 --> 00:47:35,954
This weekend, a youth
 retreat is scheduled

712
00:47:35,954 --> 00:47:38,089
at Forest Way Resort.

713
00:47:38,089 --> 00:47:40,358
I want you to take the
 youth group there--

714
00:47:40,358 --> 00:47:42,894
- Uh, I had something
 else planned

715
00:47:42,894 --> 00:47:44,262
for the kids this weekend.

716
00:47:44,262 --> 00:47:47,465
- No, you're gonna take
them to this resort,

717
00:47:47,465 --> 00:47:49,467
and when you come back,
we'll decide if you

718
00:47:49,467 --> 00:47:50,868
still have a job.

719
00:47:54,639 --> 00:47:56,307
Here's the directions
 and the information

720
00:47:56,307 --> 00:47:58,576
and everything you'll need.

721
00:47:59,911 --> 00:48:03,681
Now read my lips, get
signed permission slips.

722
00:48:05,016 --> 00:48:06,952
Can you do that?

723
00:48:06,952 --> 00:48:08,286
Are you capable?

724
00:48:10,488 --> 00:48:11,322
Good.

725
00:48:14,225 --> 00:48:16,327
Try and have a nice time.

726
00:48:25,536 --> 00:48:26,904
- [Underdog] My ring.

727
00:48:26,904 --> 00:48:28,173
- [Polly] Your ring?

728
00:48:28,173 --> 00:48:31,209
- [Underdog] The secret
place in my ring I feel

729
00:48:31,209 --> 00:48:34,112
is an Underdog
 energy vitamin pill.

730
00:48:35,213 --> 00:48:37,715
- [Polly] Of course, I forgot.

731
00:48:45,623 --> 00:48:46,857
Here they come!

732
00:48:57,568 --> 00:49:00,005
(drum music)

733
00:49:49,287 --> 00:49:51,956
(siren blaring)

734
00:50:02,567 --> 00:50:03,734
- [Underdog] This trap
 was meant for rats,

735
00:50:03,734 --> 00:50:06,237
not you, so please be careful.

736
00:50:07,905 --> 00:50:09,974
- [Polly] Help, Underdog!

737
00:50:12,910 --> 00:50:15,246
- [Underdog] When Polly's
 in trouble, I am not slow.

738
00:50:15,246 --> 00:50:17,815
It's hip hip hip and away I go!

739
00:50:19,184 --> 00:50:22,453
- Lord, help. (crying)

740
00:50:39,904 --> 00:50:42,473
(gentle music)

741
00:51:17,675 --> 00:51:19,344
- Come on, let's go!

742
00:51:29,787 --> 00:51:31,389
- This is your
 parent's signature?

743
00:51:31,389 --> 00:51:32,223
Sheesh.

744
00:51:36,127 --> 00:51:39,164
You leave no cover
 behind, do you, Bobby?

745
00:51:39,164 --> 00:51:43,134
- Music is the key
 to survival, my man.

746
00:51:43,134 --> 00:51:45,170
- I just think we should stay
 here and forget about it.

747
00:51:45,170 --> 00:51:47,338
- Come on, we can't
 turn back now.

748
00:51:47,338 --> 00:51:49,174
We've come this far already.

749
00:51:49,174 --> 00:51:52,310
Besides, I can't stick
 around there anymore,

750
00:51:52,310 --> 00:51:53,978
I'm gonna go insane.

751
00:51:57,815 --> 00:52:00,618
Aw, come on, we
 can still make it.

752
00:52:02,387 --> 00:52:04,222
I'll help you pack.

753
00:52:04,222 --> 00:52:08,393
We're gonna make a whole new
 life for ourselves, together.

754
00:52:09,360 --> 00:52:10,861
You and me, Jenny.

755
00:52:13,431 --> 00:52:15,700
- Where's Sloane and Jenny?

756
00:52:17,835 --> 00:52:20,238
We'll pick 'em up on the way.

757
00:52:32,817 --> 00:52:35,386
Hey, where are you guys off to?

758
00:52:45,730 --> 00:52:47,365
Where ya goin'?

759
00:52:47,365 --> 00:52:50,368
- Just get outta
 the way, all right?

760
00:52:51,902 --> 00:52:53,738
- You know where you
 should be right now.

761
00:52:53,738 --> 00:52:56,307
You should be on that
van with the other guys.

762
00:52:56,307 --> 00:52:57,642
When your dad finds
 out you're not,

763
00:52:57,642 --> 00:52:58,909
he's gonna have a fit.

764
00:52:58,909 --> 00:53:00,010
- I don't care what
 my dad thinks anymore.

765
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:02,513
He has no control over my life!

766
00:53:03,681 --> 00:53:06,884
- Wait a minute,
 hold on a second.

767
00:53:06,884 --> 00:53:08,619
Think about what you're
doin' here, Sloane.

768
00:53:08,619 --> 00:53:12,056
- Look, I'm not goin'
 with you guys, all right?

769
00:53:12,056 --> 00:53:14,425
- Don't do it for me, Sloane.

770
00:53:14,425 --> 00:53:16,861
I want you to do what's right.

771
00:53:16,861 --> 00:53:20,698
Figure out what the Lord
would want you to do.

772
00:53:21,899 --> 00:53:24,635
- Maybe we should
 just go with them.

773
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:30,107
- All right, we'll go.

774
00:53:35,980 --> 00:53:38,683
- I hear this resort
 is pretty nice.

775
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:41,786
They got a spa,
 jacuzzi, weight room.

776
00:53:43,288 --> 00:53:46,657
- I've been there
about five times, okay?

777
00:53:46,657 --> 00:53:47,492
- Oh.

778
00:53:49,226 --> 00:53:51,061
You know you guys have
 an awful lot of stuff

779
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,297
packed in those bags.

780
00:53:52,297 --> 00:53:55,733
I mean, where were
 you plannin' on goin'?

781
00:53:58,669 --> 00:54:01,171
(van rattling)

782
00:54:05,576 --> 00:54:08,746
- It sounds like
 something's wrong.

783
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,749
(indicator beeping)

784
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:36,006
- [Sheldon] What
 are we gonna do now?

785
00:54:37,508 --> 00:54:39,344
- Why don't we call a cab?

786
00:54:39,344 --> 00:54:42,413
- Oh, that's good,
 very good, Sloane.

787
00:54:44,515 --> 00:54:45,350
- Taxi!

788
00:54:51,288 --> 00:54:52,122
Taxi!

789
00:54:56,026 --> 00:54:59,564
- We could take a bus,
 except I don't think

790
00:54:59,564 --> 00:55:01,632
there are any buses.

791
00:55:01,632 --> 00:55:03,734
- Hold on, I got an idea.

792
00:55:05,370 --> 00:55:08,172
The shelter's just a
 few blocks from here.

793
00:55:08,172 --> 00:55:09,273
- What, the shelter?

794
00:55:09,273 --> 00:55:11,376
- Yeah, the Thompson House.

795
00:55:11,376 --> 00:55:15,546
We can hang out for a while,
 call for help, chill out.

796
00:55:16,614 --> 00:55:18,549
- Is it a homeless shelter?

797
00:55:18,549 --> 00:55:22,720
- Coke, smoke, coke, smoke,
 coke, smoke, coke coke, smoke.

798
00:55:27,825 --> 00:55:31,095
- So how far is that
 shelter from here?

799
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:38,536
- Yeah, this used to be
my old stompin' ground.

800
00:55:38,536 --> 00:55:42,072
Me and Ray hung
 out all over here.

801
00:55:42,072 --> 00:55:44,675
(somber music)

802
00:55:49,380 --> 00:55:52,750
Man, this place is as
raggedy as it ever was.

803
00:55:52,750 --> 00:55:55,085
Hasn't improved not one bit.

804
00:55:57,321 --> 00:55:58,823
Lived in there for a while.

805
00:55:58,823 --> 00:56:01,592
Got inside, found
 an old mattress.

806
00:56:02,727 --> 00:56:05,062
Whew, it was pretty raunchy.

807
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:15,005
Over back there,
 behind the dumpster,

808
00:56:16,373 --> 00:56:17,442
I used to uh,

809
00:56:19,810 --> 00:56:20,645
shoot up.

810
00:56:32,823 --> 00:56:35,560
- You guys can stay as
 long as you need to,

811
00:56:35,560 --> 00:56:38,963
but nobody lives here
without doin' some work.

812
00:56:38,963 --> 00:56:41,566
(upbeat music)

813
00:57:02,286 --> 00:57:06,457
- Dear God, thank you for
 bringing us here safely.

814
00:57:20,605 --> 00:57:21,606
- Excuse me.

815
00:57:26,443 --> 00:57:27,945
- Well, have a
 good sleep, George.

816
00:57:27,945 --> 00:57:29,446
I enjoyed talking with you.

817
00:57:29,446 --> 00:57:32,382
- Yeah, it was
 interesting anyways.

818
00:57:34,485 --> 00:57:38,122
Hey, Sloane, could
 you do me a favor?

819
00:57:38,122 --> 00:57:39,356
- What is it?

820
00:57:39,356 --> 00:57:41,792
- Could you um,
 well, never mind.

821
00:57:44,461 --> 00:57:47,264
Sloane, could you
 help tuck me in?

822
00:57:47,264 --> 00:57:48,666
- What?

823
00:57:48,666 --> 00:57:50,400
Am I supposed to be your
mother or something?

824
00:57:50,400 --> 00:57:52,402
- No, see I just can't reach.

825
00:57:52,402 --> 00:57:55,740
- Come on, grow up,
 for cryin' out loud!

826
00:57:56,574 --> 00:57:58,242
- Sloane, come here.

827
00:58:06,016 --> 00:58:09,319
Now, Sloane, you may
 think that George

828
00:58:09,319 --> 00:58:12,422
is kind of weird or
 odd or something,

829
00:58:13,591 --> 00:58:15,960
but you gotta be
 patient with him.

830
00:58:15,960 --> 00:58:20,497
He's a recovering alcoholic,
 and he needs friendship.

831
00:58:20,497 --> 00:58:22,166
He needs love.

832
00:58:22,166 --> 00:58:23,801
- Yeah, but I'm
 not a psychiatrist.

833
00:58:23,801 --> 00:58:25,302
This guy needs
 professional help.

834
00:58:25,302 --> 00:58:26,303
He's messed up.

835
00:58:26,303 --> 00:58:28,038
- Sloane, so are you.

836
00:58:29,373 --> 00:58:30,340
You are messed up.

837
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:31,175
I'm messed up.

838
00:58:31,175 --> 00:58:33,578
We're all messed up.

839
00:58:33,578 --> 00:58:36,013
Isn't it possible to just
 step out of your skin

840
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:39,483
and think about someone
besides yourself?

841
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:40,785
Is it that hard?

842
00:58:51,395 --> 00:58:53,798
- Okay, I think we all agree.

843
00:58:54,832 --> 00:58:57,001
This is an experiment
 that failed.

844
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,168
- Miserably.

845
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,737
- That guy's dangerous.

846
00:58:59,737 --> 00:59:02,940
- Walter, we have to
 put an end to this.

847
00:59:02,940 --> 00:59:06,944
- Better pull the plug
 while there's still time.

848
00:59:10,380 --> 00:59:13,217
(zippers sliding)

849
01:00:04,635 --> 01:00:07,237
- Sloane, what are you doin'?

850
01:00:07,237 --> 01:00:09,674
(drum music)

851
01:00:36,533 --> 01:00:37,367
- No!

852
01:00:55,385 --> 01:00:59,156
- You can't run from
 your problems, Sloane.

853
01:00:59,156 --> 01:01:00,758
- I would've if
 you didn't show up.

854
01:01:00,758 --> 01:01:04,494
- No, they'll just catch
up with you somehow.

855
01:01:05,696 --> 01:01:08,465
Sloane, what do you want?

856
01:01:08,465 --> 01:01:12,903
I mean, how's running
 away gonna solve anything?

857
01:01:12,903 --> 01:01:15,205
What are you looking for?

858
01:01:15,205 --> 01:01:17,607
- I just want a break.

859
01:01:17,607 --> 01:01:20,010
I'm sick of pretending.

860
01:01:20,010 --> 01:01:24,849
- Yeah, but why do you
 have to fight everything?

861
01:01:24,849 --> 01:01:25,850
Sloane, hey.

862
01:01:31,722 --> 01:01:35,159
You may have trouble
 believing this,

863
01:01:35,159 --> 01:01:37,194
but I've been there.

864
01:01:37,194 --> 01:01:39,363
I've been where you're at.

865
01:01:41,365 --> 01:01:43,367
I've been at the lowest spot,

866
01:01:43,367 --> 01:01:45,836
where the whole world
 seems pointless,

867
01:01:45,836 --> 01:01:48,172
and nothing matters.

868
01:01:48,172 --> 01:01:49,006
- So?

869
01:01:50,607 --> 01:01:55,212
- But I realized something,
 you can't keep running.

870
01:01:55,212 --> 01:01:57,181
You can't keep looking
for something artificial

871
01:01:57,181 --> 01:01:59,116
to solve your problems.

872
01:02:12,162 --> 01:02:14,731
I see you fightin', Sloane.

873
01:02:14,731 --> 01:02:18,502
You're fightin' me, your
 family, the whole world's

874
01:02:18,502 --> 01:02:20,437
on your shoulders, man.

875
01:02:21,738 --> 01:02:24,574
But it don't have
 to be like that.

876
01:02:26,176 --> 01:02:29,713
Jesus came down
 and gave his life.

877
01:02:29,713 --> 01:02:33,450
God sacrificed his own
 son so you could live.

878
01:02:35,519 --> 01:02:37,554
You don't have to fight anymore.

879
01:02:37,554 --> 01:02:42,026
- That's really great,
 but what if I don't care?

880
01:02:42,026 --> 01:02:44,528
- That's your choice.

881
01:02:44,528 --> 01:02:47,998
You have to decide
 which way to go.

882
01:02:47,998 --> 01:02:49,499
I can't force you.

883
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:52,069
But why would you turn your back

884
01:02:52,069 --> 01:02:55,105
on the creator of the universe?

885
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:57,641
- I've been through
 this already.

886
01:02:57,641 --> 01:02:59,676
When I was seven years old,
 I walked down the aisle.

887
01:02:59,676 --> 01:03:01,278
I went through the whole deal.

888
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,581
- Yeah, but God wants
 more from you, Sloane.

889
01:03:04,581 --> 01:03:07,317
He wants to live in you.

890
01:03:07,317 --> 01:03:10,587
You've got to let
 Jesus plant his seed.

891
01:03:13,090 --> 01:03:15,525
- I don't think I'm
 capable of changing.

892
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:19,763
- That's right, you've got
 to let Jesus do it for you.

893
01:03:19,763 --> 01:03:22,900
You've just got to
 give him a chance.

894
01:03:22,900 --> 01:03:24,801
Just give him a chance.

895
01:03:36,881 --> 01:03:38,548
- Please, God, help.

896
01:03:41,051 --> 01:03:44,354
(peaceful music)

897
01:03:44,354 --> 01:03:47,357
I'm sorry for running
 away from you.

898
01:03:48,893 --> 01:03:51,228
Help me turn my life around.

899
01:03:57,201 --> 01:04:00,270
Take my heart and
 clean it out, Lord.

900
01:04:06,743 --> 01:04:10,580
I give you all these
 hassles and expectations.

901
01:04:20,457 --> 01:04:22,626
Jesus, plant a seed in me,

902
01:04:27,965 --> 01:04:29,733
inside of me,

903
01:04:29,733 --> 01:04:31,969
let it grow into something,

904
01:04:36,440 --> 01:04:38,275
something you can use.

905
01:04:58,262 --> 01:05:00,230
- This doesn't
 look good, Walter.

906
01:05:00,230 --> 01:05:01,731
- Well, I figure it's
 better to get the problem

907
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:04,334
in the open rather
than letting it fester.

908
01:05:04,334 --> 01:05:06,736
- They look like a lynch mob.

909
01:05:22,219 --> 01:05:25,155
- Oh Murell, they're holding
 a meeting in the sanctuary.

910
01:05:25,155 --> 01:05:27,557
Pastor said he wants
 you there right away.

911
01:05:27,557 --> 01:05:28,625
- Right now?

912
01:05:28,625 --> 01:05:29,459
- Yeah.

913
01:06:01,458 --> 01:06:05,762
- Over the past weeks,
this church has endured

914
01:06:05,762 --> 01:06:09,566
some rather strange
 occurrences, and it is our

915
01:06:11,035 --> 01:06:14,371
intention to clear
 the air, so to speak,

916
01:06:17,441 --> 01:06:20,610
with this meeting
 of the congregation.

917
01:06:22,412 --> 01:06:24,348
- I'd just like to
know how a youth pastor

918
01:06:24,348 --> 01:06:27,251
can take a group to
 see an AIDS victim

919
01:06:27,251 --> 01:06:29,819
without consulting the
parents or anyone else?

920
01:06:29,819 --> 01:06:31,888
- And how could this
 man take our kids

921
01:06:31,888 --> 01:06:34,658
into a very dangerous
 section of the city,

922
01:06:34,658 --> 01:06:37,427
associating with drunks
and drug addicts,

923
01:06:37,427 --> 01:06:39,996
placing their lives at risk?

924
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:42,466
- Let me just say that
 I deeply regret these

925
01:06:42,466 --> 01:06:45,702
incidents, and on
 behalf of the church,

926
01:06:46,836 --> 01:06:50,240
I apologize for
 what has transpired.

927
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:54,010
Fortunately, however,
 Murell is here to directly

928
01:06:54,010 --> 01:06:57,013
address some of
 your concerns today.

929
01:07:10,727 --> 01:07:12,829
- Look, I just wanna say,

930
01:07:17,901 --> 01:07:20,904
I'm truly sorry
 about what happened.

931
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:25,008
I made a lot of mistakes,

932
01:07:25,008 --> 01:07:27,411
and I'm responsible for them.

933
01:07:30,580 --> 01:07:34,584
But I was offered this
 position a few weeks ago,

934
01:07:36,986 --> 01:07:40,157
and I can honestly
 say, I did my best.

935
01:07:44,894 --> 01:07:47,897
I really tried to
 be a youth leader.

936
01:07:51,601 --> 01:07:55,004
I tried to share
something from my heart,

937
01:07:56,173 --> 01:07:59,876
but I won't stick around
where I'm not wanted.

938
01:08:02,912 --> 01:08:03,747
- Wait.

939
01:08:05,215 --> 01:08:07,851
This man made a difference.

940
01:08:07,851 --> 01:08:10,620
He really cared about us.

941
01:08:10,620 --> 01:08:12,556
He showed us something.

942
01:08:13,957 --> 01:08:16,193
- I don't think you're
 giving this man a chance.

943
01:08:16,193 --> 01:08:19,263
I've seen a way he's taken
 an interest in my son.

944
01:08:19,263 --> 01:08:23,167
He's given these kids
 some valuable lessons.

945
01:08:23,167 --> 01:08:25,269
- You can't get rid of him.

946
01:08:25,269 --> 01:08:28,071
He's been more than
 our youth leader.

947
01:08:28,071 --> 01:08:29,906
He's been our friend.

948
01:08:29,906 --> 01:08:31,241
He belongs here.

949
01:08:32,509 --> 01:08:35,845
- Murell has taught
 me more about Christ

950
01:08:37,214 --> 01:08:40,950
and how to love others
 than any person in my life.

951
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:46,190
Dad, I know I screwed
up, and I promise to do

952
01:08:46,190 --> 01:08:49,693
better, just give this
 guy another chance.

953
01:08:51,728 --> 01:08:52,562
- Thanks.

954
01:08:54,097 --> 01:08:56,700
I really appreciate that, guys.

955
01:09:00,504 --> 01:09:02,972
I'm gonna miss you guys a lot,

956
01:09:04,574 --> 01:09:08,077
but I think it's really
time for me to go.

957
01:09:17,020 --> 01:09:19,623
(gentle music)

958
01:09:44,013 --> 01:09:45,849
- [Bobby] Hey, Murell!

959
01:09:47,884 --> 01:09:49,786
Where are you goin'?

960
01:09:49,786 --> 01:09:51,455
- Hey, guys.

961
01:09:51,455 --> 01:09:53,022
- Where you off to?

962
01:09:53,957 --> 01:09:57,126
- Gonna visit some old friends.

963
01:09:57,126 --> 01:09:59,629
- Without even saying goodbye?

964
01:10:25,922 --> 01:10:27,257
- Okay, Sheldon.

965
01:10:30,660 --> 01:10:32,329
- [Bobby] Thank you.

966
01:10:39,369 --> 01:10:40,804
- What about the youth group?

967
01:10:40,804 --> 01:10:42,138
How will it survive?

968
01:10:42,138 --> 01:10:45,141
- That's up to you
 and all you guys.

969
01:10:49,078 --> 01:10:51,915
Don't rely on
 anyone except Jesus.

970
01:10:55,519 --> 01:10:58,254
Here, I wanna give
 you something.

971
01:11:11,200 --> 01:11:13,603
- I'm gonna miss you, Murell.

972
01:11:44,668 --> 01:11:47,337
(strings music)
