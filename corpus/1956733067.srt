00:00:07,662 --> 00:00:10,941
- My name is Alan Freed
and this is my story.

2
00:00:10,976 --> 00:00:15,084
But it's also the
story of rock and roll.

3
00:00:15,118 --> 00:00:17,569
Ladies and gentlemen of Boston.

4
00:00:19,398 --> 00:00:22,263
Let's give a big, big welcome

hit in rock and roll history,

18
00:01:05,858 --> 00:01:07,481
- But let's go back
to the beginning.

19
00:01:07,515 --> 00:01:10,173
It wasn't always like this.

20
00:01:10,208 --> 00:01:12,141
Believe it or not,
there was a time

21
00:01:12,175 --> 00:01:14,143
when rock and roll didn't exist.

22
00:01:14,177 --> 00:01:15,523
Not even for me.

23
00:01:16,766 --> 00:01:18,354
I had been working the
radio for a few years

24
00:01:18,388 --> 00:01:20,045
and I loved it.

25
00:01:20,080 --> 00:01:22,185
Okay, Cleveland
wasn't the big-time,

26
00:01:22,220 --> 00:01:24,498
but it was better than Akron.

27
00:01:24,532 --> 00:01:26,396
See, I knew I was going places.

28
00:01:26,431 --> 00:01:29,019
I just wasn't sure where.

29
00:01:30,435 --> 00:01:32,471
♪ What you gonna do when
the well runs dry? ♪

31
00:01:34,784 --> 00:01:36,165
- You're late again?
- I'm not late.

32
00:01:36,199 --> 00:01:37,338
- You're on the
air in 10 seconds.

33
00:01:37,373 --> 00:01:40,134
- Well, I told
you I wasn't late.

34
00:01:40,169 --> 00:01:41,584
Hey, Buddy.

35
00:01:47,521 --> 00:01:48,418
Good day, everyone.

36
00:01:48,453 --> 00:01:51,249
This is Alan Freed
broadcasting to you

37
00:01:51,283 --> 00:01:54,424
from station W.G.B.C.
in Cleveland.

38
00:01:54,459 --> 00:01:56,495
I have some fine popular
music to play for you

39
00:01:56,530 --> 00:01:57,979
over the next two hours.

40
00:01:58,014 --> 00:01:59,326
So let's begin with a favorite

41
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:01,880
from Patti Page, Old Cape Cod.

42
00:02:03,261 --> 00:02:05,228
Sing it, Patti baby.

43
00:02:05,263 --> 00:02:09,267
Let me hear those
sweet, sweet high notes.

44
00:02:11,061 --> 00:02:12,684
- What'd I tell you
about that funny stuff?

45
00:02:12,718 --> 00:02:14,341
- It's personality, boss.

46
00:02:14,375 --> 00:02:19,518
- Do me a favor, keep your
personality to yourself.

47
00:02:19,553 --> 00:02:23,108
- So there I was, broadcasting
in Ohio's biggest market,

48
00:02:23,143 --> 00:02:25,352
working every angle I could.

49
00:02:25,386 --> 00:02:29,459
But I was still lost and
deep inside I knew it.

50
00:02:30,633 --> 00:02:34,844
The magnificent big band
sound, ladies and gentlemen.

51
00:02:34,878 --> 00:02:38,882
And since you love it so
much, here's some more.

52
00:02:51,826 --> 00:02:54,933
Remind me, is this
a wake or a dance?

53
00:03:06,738 --> 00:03:08,326
That was sweet.

54
00:03:08,360 --> 00:03:11,467
And now for something
really special.

55
00:03:12,502 --> 00:03:15,229

00:03:15,264 --> 00:03:17,438

Turn that music off.

66

♪ Having me some fun tonight

67
00:03:40,875 --> 00:03:42,118

That's colored music!

69
00:03:44,120 --> 00:03:46,502
That music don't belong here!

70
00:03:46,536 --> 00:03:47,917
- What's wrong with it?

71
00:03:47,951 --> 00:03:49,746
- It's ugly, it's trash.

72
00:03:49,781 --> 00:03:51,541
- Now go back to
playing good music.

73
00:03:51,576 --> 00:03:53,681
- What do you mean, good music?

74
00:03:53,716 --> 00:03:55,338
- Good music is what
we want to hear.

75
00:03:55,373 --> 00:03:56,443
It's what we dance to,

76
00:03:56,477 --> 00:03:58,203
what our children will dance to.

77
00:03:58,238 --> 00:03:59,584
And if you don't
want to play it,

78
00:03:59,618 --> 00:04:03,898
then take your records,
Mr. Freed, and go home!

79
00:04:03,933 --> 00:04:06,556
- You have to remember,
back then most white people

80
00:04:06,591 --> 00:04:08,696
had never heard of
rhythm and blues.

81
00:04:08,731 --> 00:04:10,042
When it was played on the radio,

82
00:04:10,077 --> 00:04:12,286
it was by stations at
the top of the dial.

83
00:04:12,321 --> 00:04:15,634
A place mainstream
listeners just did not go.

84
00:04:15,669 --> 00:04:18,637
But that night really
knocked me out.

85
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,294
Their parents may have hated it,

86
00:04:20,329 --> 00:04:21,813
but there was
something in that R&B

87
00:04:21,847 --> 00:04:24,298
those kids really responded to.

88
00:04:24,333 --> 00:04:25,955
And you know what, so did I.

welcome to the store.

How the hell are you?

99
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:59,264
- Hey, Leo, you sell
a lot of these rhythm

100
00:04:59,299 --> 00:05:00,334
and blues records?

101
00:05:00,369 --> 00:05:01,749
- Oh, tons.

102
00:05:01,784 --> 00:05:03,026
To the Negros obviously,

103
00:05:03,061 --> 00:05:05,132
but a lot of the white kids are
buying them too, like crazy.

104
00:05:05,166 --> 00:05:06,340
- It's got a great beat.

105
00:05:06,375 --> 00:05:07,376
- Well, it's
not like the stuff

106
00:05:07,410 --> 00:05:08,446
their parents listen to.

107
00:05:08,480 --> 00:05:10,344
- Like what I play on my show.

108
00:05:10,379 --> 00:05:11,794
- Oh, well, yeah.

109
00:05:13,036 --> 00:05:14,210
You know, actually, I'm thinking

110
00:05:14,244 --> 00:05:17,903
of sponsoring an all
R&B program on WNXP.

111
00:05:17,938 --> 00:05:20,492
You know, up-tempo dance stuff.

112
00:05:21,424 --> 00:05:24,254
- Leo, how about
sponsoring an all rhythm

113
00:05:24,289 --> 00:05:27,430
and blues program
on WGBC with me?

114
00:05:27,465 --> 00:05:28,880
- What are you, nuts?

115
00:05:28,914 --> 00:05:30,709
Race records on an
all white station?

116
00:05:30,744 --> 00:05:33,402
- Well, you just said white
kids are buying the records.

117
00:05:33,436 --> 00:05:34,886
Now, if I could play it
on a mainstream station

118
00:05:34,920 --> 00:05:37,026
I could get people
excited about the music.

119
00:05:37,060 --> 00:05:38,234
- Absolutely not.

120
00:05:38,268 --> 00:05:39,131
- Come on, Pete.

121
00:05:39,166 --> 00:05:40,512
- I'm running a business here.

122
00:05:40,547 --> 00:05:41,962
- Leo's gonna sponsor
the whole thing.

123
00:05:41,996 --> 00:05:43,446
It won't cost you a dime.

124
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:46,069
- If I don't lose cash
I'm gonna lose listeners.

125
00:05:46,104 --> 00:05:47,312
- No, no, no.

126
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:48,934
You're gonna gain new listeners.

127
00:05:48,969 --> 00:05:50,419
Tell him about the sales, Leo.

128
00:05:50,453 --> 00:05:52,800
R&b singles are just
flying out of the store.

129
00:05:52,835 --> 00:05:54,354
- Yeah, to the colored people.

130
00:05:54,388 --> 00:05:55,182
- White people too.

131
00:05:55,216 --> 00:05:56,114
Young white people.

132
00:05:56,148 --> 00:05:57,218
- See?

133
00:05:57,253 --> 00:05:59,048
Pete, just give me a chance

134
00:05:59,082 --> 00:06:00,636

gonna flip for it.

Negro and white.

136
00:06:02,223 --> 00:06:03,811
Despite considerable resistance,

137
00:06:03,846 --> 00:06:05,744
the station gave me
my one hour a night

138
00:06:05,779 --> 00:06:07,850
of pure rhythm and blues.

139
00:06:09,023 --> 00:06:10,404
Hello, everybody.

140
00:06:10,439 --> 00:06:12,682

by the Record Roundabout.

143
00:06:17,342 --> 00:06:21,311
And for the next hour I will
be playing a new kind of music

144
00:06:21,346 --> 00:06:24,591
and this music is
called rhythm and blues.

145
00:06:24,625 --> 00:06:26,247
Now, this is the kind of music

146
00:06:26,282 --> 00:06:29,216

really wanna jump.

147
00:06:29,250 --> 00:06:31,667

It was like the whole city
of Cleveland was tuned

into Alan Freed.

170
00:07:28,724 --> 00:07:30,173
I would play a record at night,

171
00:07:30,208 --> 00:07:32,935
and the next kids would
run out and buy it.

172
00:07:32,969 --> 00:07:36,110

studio down the hall...

anything besides the tango?

- Of course, the waltz,
foxtrot, charleston.

- Anything more current?

178
00:07:55,095 --> 00:07:56,855
- What exactly did
you have in mind?

179
00:07:56,890 --> 00:07:59,617
- I'll tell you what, I do
this radio show down the hall.

180
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:02,896
When you're done here, why
don't you come by and say hi?

181
00:08:02,930 --> 00:08:04,691
- You're Alan Freed?

182
00:08:05,623 --> 00:08:08,073
Oh, I thought Alan
Freed was colored.

183
00:08:08,108 --> 00:08:10,248
- Yeah, I get that all the time.

184
00:08:10,282 --> 00:08:11,283
- Oh.

185
00:08:11,318 --> 00:08:13,009
Well, I'm not done till late.

186
00:08:13,044 --> 00:08:14,459
- Well, it's an open invitation.

187
00:08:14,494 --> 00:08:17,048
You just come by
whenever you like.

188
00:08:17,082 --> 00:08:17,911
- Okay.

189
00:08:19,947 --> 00:08:21,949
Okay, class, back to the tango.

190
00:08:21,984 --> 00:08:23,537
I need a volunteer.

191
00:08:24,607 --> 00:08:25,850
Come on, you guys.

192
00:08:25,884 --> 00:08:27,334
I need a partner.

193
00:08:29,543 --> 00:08:30,924
Can you dance?

194
00:08:30,958 --> 00:08:32,028
- No.

195
00:08:32,995 --> 00:08:34,237
- Okay.

196
00:08:34,272 --> 00:08:35,100
Music.

197
00:09:02,058 --> 00:09:02,887
Ooh!

198
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:17,315
- Really want to impress a gal?

199
00:09:17,349 --> 00:09:19,351
Dance the tango with her.

200
00:09:19,386 --> 00:09:21,112
Not only did she
come watch my show,

201
00:09:21,146 --> 00:09:23,079
she let me walk her
home afterwards.

202
00:09:23,114 --> 00:09:24,598
It's not an act.

203
00:09:24,633 --> 00:09:27,981
I am telling you, this music
could change the world.

204
00:09:28,015 --> 00:09:30,328
And I want everyone to hear it.

205
00:09:30,362 --> 00:09:33,365
- Why, are you a rhythm
and blues missionary?

206
00:09:33,400 --> 00:09:37,197
- No, but I do get a
kind of religious feeling

207
00:09:37,231 --> 00:09:39,475
when I hear a really good song.

208
00:09:39,509 --> 00:09:41,581
And the first thing
I want to do is...

209
00:09:41,615 --> 00:09:42,443
- Pray?

210
00:09:43,721 --> 00:09:44,963
- No!

211
00:09:44,998 --> 00:09:49,934
Play it for other people so
they can feel the same thing.

212
00:09:50,382 --> 00:09:51,211
So...

213
00:09:53,662 --> 00:09:55,767
Do you have a boyfriend?

214
00:09:55,802 --> 00:09:57,355
- Not at the moment.

215
00:09:57,389 --> 00:09:58,459
What about you?

216
00:09:58,494 --> 00:09:59,668
- I've got an ex-wife.

217
00:09:59,702 --> 00:10:03,637
She lives in Florida
with our two kids.

218
00:10:03,672 --> 00:10:04,880
- Okay.

219
00:10:04,914 --> 00:10:09,539
- Well, yeah, things don't
always work out like you plan.

220
00:10:09,574 --> 00:10:10,748
- This is where I live.

221
00:10:10,782 --> 00:10:12,473
It's my mom's house.

222
00:10:13,751 --> 00:10:15,442
This is nice.

223
00:10:15,476 --> 00:10:16,961
- Nice?

224
00:10:16,995 --> 00:10:20,171
I was expecting a
different word, like...

225
00:10:20,205 --> 00:10:21,448
Sensational...

226
00:10:22,311 --> 00:10:24,140
Fantastic, magnifique.

227
00:10:25,659 --> 00:10:26,936
- I love your enthusiasm.

228
00:10:26,971 --> 00:10:29,387
- Well, it's my best trait.

229
00:10:29,421 --> 00:10:34,185
So, now that we've tangoed
together, what do we do next?

230
00:10:35,496 --> 00:10:37,153
- We say goodnight.

231
00:10:48,509 --> 00:10:51,167
I guess that's what we do next.

232
00:11:01,971 --> 00:11:03,352
- Ya!

233
00:11:03,386 --> 00:11:04,974
Ya!

234
00:11:05,009 --> 00:11:07,011
And I wanna dedicate
this next record

235
00:11:07,045 --> 00:11:10,152
to Jackie at the dance studio.

236
00:11:10,186 --> 00:11:13,569
Just to let her know
I'm thinking about her.

- So he's on the air now?

262
00:12:10,246 --> 00:12:11,247
- Right down here.

263
00:12:11,282 --> 00:12:13,802
- A beer flavor
that can't be beat.

264
00:12:13,836 --> 00:12:16,770
So, folks, take a tip
from me and give it a try.

265
00:12:16,805 --> 00:12:18,668
Then just pop a cap...

266
00:12:22,776 --> 00:12:24,985
- You always let your
DJs drink on the air?

267
00:12:25,020 --> 00:12:26,746
- The man plays
by his own rules.

268
00:12:26,780 --> 00:12:29,438
Say hello, commercial's running.

269
00:12:31,405 --> 00:12:33,787
- Jack Hooke, Royal Roost
Records out of New York City.

270
00:12:33,822 --> 00:12:35,927
- Oh, to what do I
owe the pleasure?

271
00:12:35,962 --> 00:12:36,859
- I thought you
might be interested

272
00:12:36,894 --> 00:12:38,723
in some of my company's records.

273
00:12:38,758 --> 00:12:41,105
- Have anything with
a strong dance beat?

274
00:12:41,139 --> 00:12:43,141
- As a matter of fact...

275
00:12:48,664 --> 00:12:51,805
- All right, people, straight
out of New York City,

276
00:12:51,840 --> 00:12:55,395
here comes The Cleftones
with You Baby You.

277
00:13:13,965 --> 00:13:15,518
- So you don't
listen to them first?

278
00:13:15,553 --> 00:13:17,348
- You said it had a
strong dance beat.

279
00:13:17,382 --> 00:13:19,833
- Hey, look, I
can't pay you much.

280
00:13:19,868 --> 00:13:22,077
Uh, I'm kind of tapped out here.

281
00:13:22,111 --> 00:13:24,320
- It doesn't matter what the
record companies want to play.

282
00:13:24,355 --> 00:13:26,495
If I like a song, I play it.

283
00:13:26,529 --> 00:13:28,186
If I don't, I don't.

284
00:13:30,602 --> 00:13:31,603
This song...

285
00:13:32,432 --> 00:13:33,260
I like.

286
00:13:36,332 --> 00:13:38,300
The station's getting
its best ratings ever.

287
00:13:38,334 --> 00:13:40,716
All the advertisers want
to buy time on my show,

288
00:13:40,750 --> 00:13:42,200
I'm getting a ton of fan mail.

289
00:13:42,235 --> 00:13:44,375
- All for a white guy playing
rhythm and blues records?

290
00:13:44,409 --> 00:13:45,272
Wow!

291
00:13:45,307 --> 00:13:46,480
- I wanna take it
to another level.

292
00:13:46,515 --> 00:13:48,758
I really wanna get
the music out there.

293
00:13:48,793 --> 00:13:50,450
- So put on a dance party.

294
00:13:50,484 --> 00:13:51,969
You got half the
fans you say you do,

295
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,177
you charge a couple
bucks a head,

296
00:13:53,211 --> 00:13:54,523
you can make some decent money.

297
00:13:54,557 --> 00:13:55,627
- How do I get started?

298
00:13:55,662 --> 00:13:56,939
- You book a big theater.

299
00:13:56,974 --> 00:13:59,148
You start pulling
your acts together.

300
00:13:59,183 --> 00:14:00,218
- Will you help me?

301
00:14:00,253 --> 00:14:01,047
- From New York?

302
00:14:01,081 --> 00:14:02,565
- From here!

303
00:14:02,600 --> 00:14:05,465
Listen, you help me
get this together,

304
00:14:05,499 --> 00:14:08,157
I'll split the profits with you.

305
00:14:10,642 --> 00:14:12,092
- Okay.

306
00:14:12,127 --> 00:14:12,955
I'm in.

307
00:14:14,508 --> 00:14:15,716
- It was wild.

308
00:14:15,751 --> 00:14:18,858
The first act I found was
Jackie Wilson and the Dominoes.

309
00:14:42,605 --> 00:14:46,126
♪ Oooooooo

310
00:14:46,161 --> 00:14:51,166

312
00:14:58,207 --> 00:15:03,212
♪ Oh, mamma, sweet mamma,

313
00:15:05,559 --> 00:15:09,978
♪ No, you can't keep

314
00:15:25,821 --> 00:15:26,822
- Whoa.

315
00:15:26,856 --> 00:15:27,927
No one gets past here.

316
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:29,307
- We just wanna
talk to the Dominoes

317
00:15:29,342 --> 00:15:31,068
about playing a gig for us.

318
00:15:31,102 --> 00:15:32,103
- A gig for you?

319
00:15:32,138 --> 00:15:33,587
- I'm Alan Freed and
this is my girl--

320
00:15:33,622 --> 00:15:34,692
- Alan Freed?

321
00:15:36,142 --> 00:15:37,419
Why didn't you say so?!

322
00:15:37,453 --> 00:15:38,765
Let me get them.

323
00:15:38,799 --> 00:15:40,111
Jack, come here.

324
00:15:43,459 --> 00:15:46,255
Alan Freed, this
is Jackie Wilson.

325
00:15:46,290 --> 00:15:47,325
- Jackie, what's
the largest crowd

326
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,087
you've ever played in front of?

327
00:15:50,121 --> 00:15:51,329
- This is it.

328
00:15:51,364 --> 00:15:54,470
- Well, listen to this: the
Cleveland Arena seats 8,000.

329
00:15:54,505 --> 00:15:57,473
And I'm booking it, and
I want the Dominoes.

330
00:15:57,508 --> 00:15:58,819
- You crazy?

331
00:15:58,854 --> 00:16:00,062
I never heard of a
rhythm and blues show

332
00:16:00,097 --> 00:16:01,512
where even half that
many people showed up.

333
00:16:01,546 --> 00:16:02,547
- Well, you've never
heard of a rhythm

334
00:16:02,582 --> 00:16:05,723
and blues show
promoted by Alan Freed.

335
00:16:05,757 --> 00:16:06,931
- Well, we'll see about that.

336
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:08,898
People always making
promises they can't keep.

337
00:16:08,933 --> 00:16:09,796
- Yeah?

338
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,384
Well, if you wanna
sell more records,

339
00:16:11,418 --> 00:16:13,144
if you want a shot
at the big-time,

340
00:16:13,179 --> 00:16:15,940
then you sign up for Alan
Freed's Moondog Coronation Ball

341
00:16:15,975 --> 00:16:18,287
and I promise you'll get it.

342
00:16:20,427 --> 00:16:21,221
- Take it, man.

343
00:16:21,256 --> 00:16:22,912
Take it, take it, come on.

344
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:24,293
- I love it.

345
00:16:26,606 --> 00:16:29,850
- All right, folks, listen
up, yours truly is putting

346
00:16:29,885 --> 00:16:32,370
on a dance, with all
the bands and music

347
00:16:32,405 --> 00:16:34,200
that you can't get enough of.

348
00:16:34,234 --> 00:16:36,305
It'll be on the
21st, at nine o'clock

349
00:16:36,340 --> 00:16:37,927
at the Cleveland Arena.

350
00:16:37,962 --> 00:16:40,758
That's right, the hockey
teams are taking the night off

351
00:16:40,792 --> 00:16:43,347
so you can dance, dance, dance.

352
00:16:44,900 --> 00:16:46,867
What if nobody shows up?

353
00:16:46,902 --> 00:16:47,868
- Of course, they'll show up.

354
00:16:47,903 --> 00:16:49,387
What are you talking about?

355
00:16:49,422 --> 00:16:50,561
- No, I am serious.

356
00:16:50,595 --> 00:16:54,772
The only advertising we've

535
00:27:21,294 --> 00:27:23,055
and letters that
you've been sending in.

536
00:27:23,089 --> 00:27:27,300
Now, this one starts,
"Dear Nigger Lover,

537
00:27:27,335 --> 00:27:29,475
"how dare you play
those vulgar, dirty,

538
00:27:29,509 --> 00:27:31,891
"ugly songs by Bo Diddley."

539
00:27:31,926 --> 00:27:33,479
Here's another nice one.

540
00:27:33,513 --> 00:27:37,690
"Your determination to
Africanize our airwaves

541
00:27:37,725 --> 00:27:39,692
"makes me sick."

542
00:27:39,727 --> 00:27:42,626
Oh, and how about this
one, it just says,

543
00:27:42,661 --> 00:27:46,319
"Keep that foul nigra
music off our radios."

544
00:27:49,253 --> 00:27:54,258
Well, I'm always glad to hear
the opinions of my listeners.

545
00:27:54,914 --> 00:27:57,848
And now out of South Chicago

546
00:27:57,883 --> 00:28:00,955
and Chess Records,
Mister Bo Diddley!

547
00:28:08,894 --> 00:28:10,792
♪ Bo Diddley bought his
baby a diamond ring ♪

548
00:28:10,827 --> 00:28:12,138
- Over the next year
we had our first baby

549
00:28:12,173 --> 00:28:15,797
and the popularity
of my show grew.

550
00:28:15,832 --> 00:28:16,833
Go man, go!

551
00:28:16,867 --> 00:28:18,731
Oh, yeah, rock it!

552
00:28:18,766 --> 00:28:19,905
Rock it again!

553
00:28:21,009 --> 00:28:23,184
- He sounds like a
complete nut case.

554
00:28:23,218 --> 00:28:25,393
- He's a very popular nut case.

555
00:28:25,427 --> 00:28:26,877
The kids love him.

556
00:28:26,912 --> 00:28:29,742
He draws 20,000 plus every
time he puts on a show.

557
00:28:29,777 --> 00:28:31,192
He is the hottest thing!

558
00:28:31,226 --> 00:28:32,780
- In Cleveland.

559
00:28:32,814 --> 00:28:34,126
This is New York.

560
00:28:34,160 --> 00:28:37,336
- Mr. McCaw, every time I
walk into this radio station

561
00:28:37,370 --> 00:28:41,029
you say to me, "I'm
searching for a new voice."

562
00:28:41,064 --> 00:28:43,066
I'm telling you, Alan
Freed could really

563
00:28:43,100 --> 00:28:44,930
jump-start things around here.

564
00:28:44,964 --> 00:28:46,897
Alan Freed is your guy.

565
00:28:50,245 --> 00:28:51,039
- This is W.G.B.C.

566
00:28:51,074 --> 00:28:52,903
Who's calling, please?

567
00:28:54,940 --> 00:28:57,390
Alan, someone from New York.

568
00:28:59,496 --> 00:29:00,428
- Yes, hello.

569
00:29:04,052 --> 00:29:04,881
Uh-huh.

570
00:29:07,435 --> 00:29:10,196
Well, I'll have
to call you back.

571
00:29:12,751 --> 00:29:14,545
Jackie, honey, I hope
you're listening,

572
00:29:14,580 --> 00:29:16,755
because I have something
very important to tell you:

573
00:29:16,789 --> 00:29:18,653
I just get off the
phone with someone

574
00:29:18,687 --> 00:29:21,173
from a major radio
station in New York City,

575
00:29:21,207 --> 00:29:24,245
and they have offered me a job.

576
00:29:24,279 --> 00:29:25,764
Now, I know you love Cleveland.

577
00:29:25,798 --> 00:29:27,904
I love Cleveland, too, the
fans here are the best,

578
00:29:27,938 --> 00:29:31,735
but we are talking
the entertainment capitol of the
world

579
00:29:31,770 --> 00:29:34,531
Now, if you're up for it, give
me a call here at the station

580
00:29:34,565 --> 00:29:36,326
and give me the green light.

581
00:29:36,360 --> 00:29:38,328
If I don't hear from you,
I'll assume it's a no.

582
00:29:38,362 --> 00:29:41,193
I will call them back
and decline the offer.

583
00:29:41,227 --> 00:29:42,746
Come on, Jackie!

584
00:29:42,781 --> 00:29:44,817
Yankees versus Indians.

585
00:29:44,852 --> 00:29:46,094
I'm waiting for your call.

586
00:29:51,755 --> 00:29:53,101
- W.G.B.C.

587
00:29:53,136 --> 00:29:55,552
First we've heard of it, too.

588
00:29:58,451 --> 00:29:59,280
W.G.B.C.

589
00:30:00,729 --> 00:30:01,938
I have no idea.

590
00:30:11,430 --> 00:30:13,846
- And here she is,
ladies and gentlemen.

591
00:30:13,881 --> 00:30:15,848
And your answer, Mrs. Freed?

592
00:30:15,883 --> 00:30:17,539
- Turn off the mic.

593
00:30:18,644 --> 00:30:21,267
- We'll go
to a commercial.

594
00:30:21,302 --> 00:30:23,200
- Why do you have to
broadcast our personal life

595
00:30:23,235 --> 00:30:25,030
over the airwaves?

596
00:30:25,064 --> 00:30:25,858
- I'm sorry.

597
00:30:25,893 --> 00:30:27,860
I was just so excited.

598
00:30:27,895 --> 00:30:29,966
I mean, this is our shot.

599
00:30:31,312 --> 00:30:33,762
- Is this what you really want?

600
00:30:48,467 --> 00:30:50,538
- Here's to the
king of rhythm and blues!

601
00:30:50,572 --> 00:30:52,471
- And to my queen.

602
00:30:52,505 --> 00:30:53,990
And New York City.

603
00:30:55,336 --> 00:30:56,509
You know, I've been thinking.

604
00:30:56,544 --> 00:30:58,477
The music needs
a different name.

605
00:30:58,511 --> 00:30:59,892
Rhythm and blues
is too limiting,

606
00:30:59,927 --> 00:31:01,860
people automatically
think Race Music.

607
00:31:01,894 --> 00:31:03,723
It's gotta be something
with a broader appeal.

608
00:31:03,758 --> 00:31:04,655
- And you got any ideas?

609
00:31:05,518 --> 00:31:06,795
- You know what I say, baby?

610
00:31:06,830 --> 00:31:09,177
You make me want
to rock and roll.

611
00:31:09,212 --> 00:31:11,386
- Oh, but, honey, doesn't
that mean, you know...

612
00:31:11,421 --> 00:31:12,663
- Sex?
- Yeah.

613
00:31:12,698 --> 00:31:16,426
- Yeah, but the music
is sexy: rock and roll.

614
00:31:17,703 --> 00:31:21,120
It says beat, it says
hip, it says dancing.

615
00:31:21,155 --> 00:31:21,949
- Rock and roll.

616
00:31:21,983 --> 00:31:24,675
Definitely rolls off the tongue.

617
00:31:25,538 --> 00:31:26,781
- Say it.

618
00:31:26,815 --> 00:31:28,507
- Rock and roll.

619
00:31:28,541 --> 00:31:29,922
- Say it again.

620
00:31:29,957 --> 00:31:31,372
- Rock and roll.

621
00:31:34,547 --> 00:31:36,377
- Yeah, that is sexy.

622
00:31:39,552 --> 00:31:42,210
- Long live rock and roll.

623
00:31:49,459 --> 00:31:52,531
New York City, the Big Apple.

624
00:31:52,565 --> 00:31:54,326
They didn't give me
a key to the city,

625
00:31:54,360 --> 00:31:56,224
they gave me
something much better:

626
00:31:56,259 --> 00:32:00,021
a 50,000-watt tower
and an open microphone.

627
00:32:02,575 --> 00:32:04,301
Hello, New York City!

628
00:32:05,199 --> 00:32:09,134
This is yours truly Alan
Freed, Mr. Rock and Roll.

629
00:32:11,584 --> 00:32:15,105
And I am ready for a big
of rocking and rolling!

630
00:32:15,140 --> 00:32:18,902
Welcome to rock and
roll party number one!

631
00:32:18,937 --> 00:32:20,662
I'm going to be playing all
the great rock and roll records

632
00:32:20,697 --> 00:32:22,975
with that big beat
that nobody can resist,

633
00:32:23,010 --> 00:32:25,219
and by the time I'm through,
New York City will be the rock

634
00:32:25,253 --> 00:32:28,463
and roll kingdom of the world!

635
00:32:28,498 --> 00:32:30,431
You can't stop this sound,

636
00:32:30,465 --> 00:32:32,364
you can't stop me
from playing it.

637
00:32:36,402 --> 00:32:39,060
♪ Up in the morning
and out to school ♪

638
00:32:39,095 --> 00:32:42,236
- Can I get some
more volume on that?

639
00:32:42,270 --> 00:32:43,099
Higher.

640
00:32:46,654 --> 00:32:47,482
Higher.

641
00:32:51,590 --> 00:32:52,418
Yeah!

642
00:32:53,454 --> 00:32:55,214
That's the way to
listen to rock and roll!

643
00:32:55,249 --> 00:32:57,665
I took off
like no one in the history

644
00:32:57,699 --> 00:32:59,253
of New York radio.

645
00:32:59,287 --> 00:33:02,877
The station shot to number
one virtually overnight.

646
00:33:02,911 --> 00:33:04,396
Alan Freed rock and roll clubs

647
00:33:04,430 --> 00:33:06,812
started popping up everywhere.

648
00:33:06,846 --> 00:33:10,954
Though I can't say that all
the attention was positive.

649
00:33:10,989 --> 00:33:12,818
- Alan, I want you to
meet a group of parents

650
00:33:12,852 --> 00:33:15,062
whose teenagers
listen to your show.

651
00:33:15,096 --> 00:33:17,512
- What can I do for you?

652
00:33:17,547 --> 00:33:21,102
- Mr. Freed, are you aware
of the sexual connotations

653
00:33:21,137 --> 00:33:23,173
in the lyrics of
the songs you play?

654
00:33:23,208 --> 00:33:26,107
- Well, I know there are
no four-letter words.

655
00:33:26,142 --> 00:33:28,282
- But the words are
extremely suggestive

656
00:33:28,316 --> 00:33:32,113
and in some cases
downright obscene.

657
00:33:32,148 --> 00:33:34,012
Just the titles alone.

658
00:33:35,875 --> 00:33:39,017
"It Ain't the Meat,
It's the Motion,

659
00:33:39,051 --> 00:33:40,915
"I Got Loaded,

660
00:33:40,949 --> 00:33:44,056
"Baby Let Me Bang Your Box."

661
00:33:44,091 --> 00:33:47,611
And you think it is proper
for our children to hear that?

662
00:33:47,646 --> 00:33:49,751
- Well, why not?

663
00:33:49,786 --> 00:33:52,064
If you don't think teenagers
have sex on the brain,

664
00:33:52,099 --> 00:33:54,032
then you are fooling yourselves.

665
00:33:54,066 --> 00:33:56,655
And I think dancing to
rock and roll is a safe,

666
00:33:56,689 --> 00:33:59,658
healthy way to express
those feelings.

667
00:33:59,692 --> 00:34:01,694

00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:20,764
- Jackie Wilson solo.

715
00:36:20,799 --> 00:36:22,318
I love it.

716
00:36:22,352 --> 00:36:24,112
- Hey, man, it was
just time to go.

717
00:36:24,147 --> 00:36:25,459
What do you think
of the new song?

718
00:36:25,493 --> 00:36:27,392
- It is great.

719
00:36:27,426 --> 00:36:29,359
How can I help?

720
00:36:29,394 --> 00:36:30,222
- Play it.

721
00:36:33,432 --> 00:36:34,985
Got any shows planned?

722
00:36:35,020 --> 00:36:36,401
- Do I have any shows planned?

723
00:36:36,435 --> 00:36:39,231
We're gonna teach
this town to rock.

724
00:36:39,266 --> 00:36:40,198
- Sounds ambitious.

725
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:41,578
I like it.

726
00:36:41,613 --> 00:36:42,648
I've been waiting to meet you

727
00:36:42,683 --> 00:36:44,823
since you came to
town, Mr. Freed.

728
00:36:44,857 --> 00:36:46,480
I'm Morris Levy.

729
00:36:46,514 --> 00:36:47,481
I own this joint.

730
00:36:47,515 --> 00:36:48,654
- Oh, this is more than a joint,

731
00:36:48,689 --> 00:36:50,553
this is a great
place to hear music.

732
00:36:50,587 --> 00:36:53,556
- I got good taste
and so do you.

733
00:36:53,590 --> 00:36:55,247
Your lady friend is lovely.

734
00:36:55,282 --> 00:36:56,455
- I'm his wife.

735
00:36:56,490 --> 00:36:58,216
But thank you.

736
00:36:58,250 --> 00:36:59,976
- So you have a good
ear and a good eye.

737
00:37:00,010 --> 00:37:00,942
What else are you good at?

738
00:37:00,977 --> 00:37:02,530
- Business.

739
00:37:02,565 --> 00:37:03,876
We should sit down
and talk some time.

740
00:37:03,911 --> 00:37:05,533
We have a lot to discuss.

741
00:37:05,568 --> 00:37:07,017
- Do we?

742
00:37:07,052 --> 00:37:11,263
- Mrs. Freed, your husband's
a very talented talker here.

743
00:37:11,298 --> 00:37:14,370
If he learns to
listen he can go far.

744
00:37:17,787 --> 00:37:21,480
- Alan, they say he's
connected to the mob.

745
00:37:21,515 --> 00:37:23,448
- And now he owns the
most successful night club

746
00:37:23,482 --> 00:37:24,518
in New York City.

747
00:37:24,552 --> 00:37:26,658
- Yeah, but you gotta
watch a guy like that.

748
00:37:26,692 --> 00:37:29,419
First, things start off
all nice and friendly.

749
00:37:29,454 --> 00:37:32,284
Next thing you
know, he owns you.

750
00:37:32,319 --> 00:37:34,390
- No one's gonna own me.

751
00:37:39,326 --> 00:37:40,361
Talk, Mr. Levy.

752
00:37:40,396 --> 00:37:41,431
I'm listening.

753
00:37:41,466 --> 00:37:45,539
- Answer me this: what
does Alan Freed want?

754
00:37:45,573 --> 00:37:47,955
- Alan Freed wants to
stage the biggest rock

755
00:37:47,989 --> 00:37:50,337
and roll show this
city's ever seen.

756
00:37:50,371 --> 00:37:52,787
- You got enthusiasm,
that's good.

757
00:37:52,822 --> 00:37:53,857
But you're gonna need a partner,

758
00:37:53,892 --> 00:37:55,238
someone with the
right connections.

759
00:37:55,273 --> 00:37:56,688
- Someone like you?

760
00:37:56,722 --> 00:37:58,345
- There you go.

761
00:37:58,379 --> 00:37:59,863
But if we start out too big,

762
00:37:59,898 --> 00:38:02,521
there's no place to go but down.

763
00:38:02,556 --> 00:38:04,799
I don't want you to go down.

764
00:38:04,834 --> 00:38:06,042
Start smaller.

765
00:38:06,076 --> 00:38:06,870
- Let it build.

766
00:38:06,905 --> 00:38:08,009
- Right.

767
00:38:08,044 --> 00:38:10,218
I'll take all the
financial risk.

768
00:38:10,253 --> 00:38:12,704
You just plug the
show on the air

769
00:38:12,738 --> 00:38:14,602
and I'll give you
half the action.

770
00:38:14,637 --> 00:38:15,914
- Only half?

771
00:38:15,948 --> 00:38:17,364
- You want less?

772
00:38:18,779 --> 00:38:22,334
- You're a real character,
aren't you, Mr. Levy?

773
00:38:22,369 --> 00:38:26,338
- The realiest character
you'll ever meet.

774
00:38:26,373 --> 00:38:28,858
And please, call me Mo.

775
00:38:44,218 --> 00:38:47,014
- You're not worried
about that mob thing?

776
00:38:47,048 --> 00:38:48,429
- What mob thing?

777
00:38:49,672 --> 00:38:52,675
Morris Levy is a
shrewd businessman.

778
00:38:57,335 --> 00:38:59,129
- I'm sure he's not the
only shrewd businessman

779
00:38:59,164 --> 00:39:00,268
in this city.

780
00:39:01,235 --> 00:39:02,063
- What...

781
00:39:03,548 --> 00:39:04,376
Are...

782
00:39:05,653 --> 00:39:07,172
You trying to say?

783
00:39:21,324 --> 00:39:22,152
- That...

784
00:39:24,948 --> 00:39:29,539
If Morris Levy doesn't back
you, someone else will.

785
00:39:29,574 --> 00:39:31,196
What's the big hurry?

786
00:39:31,230 --> 00:39:33,854
- Well, the big hurry is...

787
00:39:33,888 --> 00:39:37,858
Well, you never know
what's gonna happen.

788
00:39:37,892 --> 00:39:39,963
I could be dead tomorrow.

789
00:40:04,056 --> 00:40:06,680
Get ready, New
York, here I come!

790
00:40:06,714 --> 00:40:09,648
Yours truly, Alan Freed, the
old king of rock and rollers,

791
00:40:09,683 --> 00:40:11,961
is putting on a big dance party
at the Brooklyn Paramount.

792
00:40:11,995 --> 00:40:13,272
And all the greatest performers

793
00:40:13,307 --> 00:40:15,136
in the rock and roll
universe will be there.

794
00:40:15,171 --> 00:40:18,761
Mr. Excitement Jackie Wilson,
marvelous Clyde McPhatter,

795
00:40:18,795 --> 00:40:20,314
dazzling Fats Domino.

796
00:40:20,348 --> 00:40:21,384
Everyone.

797
00:40:21,419 --> 00:40:24,042
- 24 grand in 24 hours.

798
00:40:24,076 --> 00:40:26,562
I never seen anything like it.

799
00:40:41,162 --> 00:40:43,371
Man, this is nuts.

800
00:40:44,718 --> 00:40:48,307
- Welcome to America's
biggest dance party.

801
00:40:50,517 --> 00:40:54,590
I'm Alan Freed, and it's
time to turn up the volume!

802
00:40:59,353 --> 00:41:01,528
What do you want
to do, Brooklyn?

803
00:41:01,562 --> 00:41:03,046
- Rock and roll!

804
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:04,910
- That's right.

805
00:41:04,945 --> 00:41:07,188
It's time to rock and roll.

806
00:41:09,536 --> 00:41:11,020
Man, what a whirlwind!

807
00:41:11,054 --> 00:41:13,298
Shows, promotions, parties.

808
00:41:13,332 --> 00:41:16,474
Two years of non-stop
rocking and rolling.

809
00:41:16,508 --> 00:41:19,511
- Ad revenues are up almost 50%.

810
00:41:19,546 --> 00:41:23,653
Whatever the hell you're
doing, keep doing it!

811
00:41:23,688 --> 00:41:24,827
- Yes, sir.

812
00:41:24,861 --> 00:41:27,105
And I still couldn't get enough.

813
00:41:27,139 --> 00:41:29,590
Although I can't say
the same for Jackie.

814
00:41:29,625 --> 00:41:31,385
And then Morris Levy called.

815
00:41:31,419 --> 00:41:33,076
He booked the New
York Paramount.

816
00:41:33,111 --> 00:41:35,700
We had finally made
it to Broadway.

817
00:41:35,734 --> 00:41:39,462
So now, I had to sell the
show every way that I could.

818
00:41:39,497 --> 00:41:41,706
It was non-stop talk.

819
00:41:41,740 --> 00:41:43,673
I knew if I made
the show a success,

820
00:41:43,708 --> 00:41:45,675
everything would work out.

821
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:46,538

matters, but what's it for?

would've put some away,

seems to evaporate.

00:45:23,755 --> 00:45:25,032
- Now, we'll make it easy.

893
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:29,588
No interest, no fees, just
a quick, clean transaction.

894
00:45:32,902 --> 00:45:35,353
- And I will pay you back
every cent just as soon

895
00:45:35,387 --> 00:45:37,665
as I get a little bit ahead.

896
00:45:40,599 --> 00:45:41,980
From Roulette Records?

897
00:45:42,015 --> 00:45:44,258
- My company banks the
paper on your house,

898
00:45:44,293 --> 00:45:46,502
you and I continue
to build our empire.

899
00:45:46,536 --> 00:45:48,124
It's good business.

900
00:45:50,195 --> 00:45:51,576
- Thanks, Mo.

901
00:45:51,610 --> 00:45:54,130
- Now, uh, let's talk
about my new acts:

902
00:45:54,165 --> 00:45:55,545
Frankie Lymon and the Teenagers.

903
00:45:55,580 --> 00:45:56,788
- Oh, are great!

904
00:45:56,823 --> 00:45:58,341
They are really gonna go places.

905
00:45:58,376 --> 00:46:00,688
- What about the Wildcats?

906
00:46:00,723 --> 00:46:02,000
- Wildcats?

907
00:46:02,035 --> 00:46:05,555
Come on, they haven't
recorded a good song yet.

908
00:46:05,590 --> 00:46:06,556
- They need exposure.

909
00:46:06,591 --> 00:46:07,937
People gotta hear their records,

910
00:46:07,972 --> 00:46:09,456
they need to get
out and perform.

911
00:46:09,490 --> 00:46:10,975
- What they need is talent.

912
00:46:11,009 --> 00:46:13,632
- Alan, I'm not just any label.

913
00:46:15,462 --> 00:46:20,087
- When they put out a good
song, I'll play it, okay?

914
00:46:20,122 --> 00:46:23,573
Now, I gotta go see
someone in Cleveland.

915
00:46:27,992 --> 00:46:30,511
- There has to be some balance.

916
00:46:30,546 --> 00:46:32,928
With you it's just
work, work, work.

917
00:46:32,962 --> 00:46:34,826
The only time I get
to see you is at shows

918
00:46:34,861 --> 00:46:37,173
or parties or Alan
Freed appearances.

919
00:46:37,208 --> 00:46:38,312
- But you're my partner.

920
00:46:38,347 --> 00:46:39,831
- I'm your wife.

921
00:46:39,866 --> 00:46:42,696
Morris Levy is your partner.

922
00:46:42,730 --> 00:46:43,835
I don't trust him.

923
00:46:43,870 --> 00:46:46,700
- We do business
together, so what?

924
00:46:46,734 --> 00:46:48,046
- Do you remember
what Jackie said?

925
00:46:48,081 --> 00:46:50,152
- And what did I say to Jackie?

926
00:46:50,186 --> 00:46:53,362
No one owns Alan
Freed but Alan Freed.

927
00:46:59,023 --> 00:47:02,509
I can't do this
without you, baby.

928
00:47:02,543 --> 00:47:05,546
You and Siggy, you
guys are my life.

929
00:47:08,998 --> 00:47:09,999
- I've got news for you.

930
00:47:10,034 --> 00:47:13,554
It's me, Siggy and
another one on the way.

931
00:47:15,833 --> 00:47:16,661
- Really?

932
00:47:18,836 --> 00:47:19,664
Oh, man!

933
00:47:20,907 --> 00:47:22,253
Oh, man!

934
00:47:22,287 --> 00:47:25,394
Well, one surprise
deserves another.

935
00:47:27,154 --> 00:47:28,328
- Wait, you bought a new car?

936
00:47:28,362 --> 00:47:29,743
- A new house.

937
00:47:29,777 --> 00:47:32,332
It's on the Connecticut coast.

938
00:47:32,366 --> 00:47:34,506
It's a world away from the city

939
00:47:34,541 --> 00:47:37,371
and the parties and the shows.

940
00:47:37,406 --> 00:47:40,961
It's a place where we
can be a real family.

941
00:47:43,584 --> 00:47:45,310
- You bought a house?

942
00:47:46,173 --> 00:47:49,867
♪ Please say you'll be mine

943
00:47:53,629 --> 00:47:56,874
- Six months later the house
was ready and we moved in.

944
00:47:56,908 --> 00:47:58,427
It looks like my jacket.

945
00:47:58,461 --> 00:47:59,462
- It does not.

946
00:47:59,497 --> 00:48:00,532
Okay, how about this one?

947
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:01,775
- Ooh, I like that.

948
00:48:01,809 --> 00:48:02,983
- That's a good one.

949
00:48:03,018 --> 00:48:04,709
- Isn't this great?!

950
00:48:06,228 --> 00:48:09,162
I mean, don't you just love it?

951
00:48:09,196 --> 00:48:10,197
- What's not to love.

952
00:48:10,232 --> 00:48:12,027
All we're missing is a
moat and a drawbridge.

953
00:48:12,061 --> 00:48:14,857
- And, because we're
so close to the water,

954
00:48:14,892 --> 00:48:17,204
the first thing I'm
gonna do is buy a boat

955
00:48:17,239 --> 00:48:19,344
and teach the kids how to fish.

00:49:07,668 --> 00:49:09,947
Hollywood suddenly discovered
there was a huge teen market

974
00:49:09,981 --> 00:49:12,052
waiting to be tapped, and
they thought I was the man

975
00:49:12,087 --> 00:49:13,674
to help them do it.

976
00:49:15,090 --> 00:49:17,540

be a couple of weeks more.

Thanks, Jack, you're a pal.

982
00:49:24,133 --> 00:49:27,205
My first movie was Rock Around
the Clock with Bill Haley.

983
00:49:27,240 --> 00:49:29,483
I followed it up with two
movies using all the stars

984
00:49:29,518 --> 00:49:30,622
like Chuck Berry
and Little Richard.

985
00:49:30,657 --> 00:49:32,383

- You can put me in jail,
you can condemn rock

and roll all you want,
but teenagers love it

990
00:49:41,840 --> 00:49:43,014

them in a language

weren't compatible.

on last night's program.

1081
00:54:03,378 --> 00:54:05,690
It ended with Frankie Lymon
and a white girl dancing

1082
00:54:05,725 --> 00:54:07,244
with each other.

1083
00:54:07,278 --> 00:54:09,660
Southern affiliates
are going crazy.

1084
00:54:09,694 --> 00:54:11,489
Over 20 stations
called the sponsor

1085
00:54:11,524 --> 00:54:14,354
and threatened to take
The Big Beat off the air.

1086
00:54:14,389 --> 00:54:18,013
- All because Frankie Lymon
danced with a white girl?

1087
00:54:18,047 --> 00:54:19,877
- This is New York City.

1088
00:54:19,911 --> 00:54:21,396
The rest of the country
is a little behind

1089
00:54:21,430 --> 00:54:23,501
in its racial attitudes.

1090
00:54:23,536 --> 00:54:25,400
- Well, that's their problem.

1091
00:54:25,434 --> 00:54:27,712
- No, no, it's our problem.

1092
00:54:29,162 --> 00:54:31,060
The sponsor personally
called my boss

1093
00:54:31,095 --> 00:54:32,648
and said they'll continue
supporting the show

1094
00:54:32,683 --> 00:54:35,720
only if you book white
acts from now on.

1095
00:54:35,755 --> 00:54:37,412
- You've gotta be kidding!

1096
00:54:37,446 --> 00:54:38,723
- I'm afraid not.

1097
00:54:38,758 --> 00:54:40,311
- For crying out loud!

1098
00:54:40,346 --> 00:54:42,969
The music was born
in the Negro culture.

1099
00:54:43,003 --> 00:54:45,868
They pioneered it,
it's their sound.

1100
00:54:45,903 --> 00:54:48,008
- And now it's crossed over.

1101
00:54:48,043 --> 00:54:50,770
There are plenty of
white rock and roll acts,

1102
00:54:50,804 --> 00:54:51,874
what's the big deal?

1103
00:54:51,909 --> 00:54:55,326
- The big deal is,
it would be a lie.

1104
00:54:55,361 --> 00:54:58,743
You can't put on a rock and
roll show without Negro acts,

1105
00:54:58,778 --> 00:55:00,055

city from here to Kalamazoo.

But after this one tour, I'll
be able to pay him all back.

1176
00:58:34,269 --> 00:58:36,996
- Jackie warned
you, I warned you.

1177
00:58:37,030 --> 00:58:38,722
- Look, it's nothing
to worry about.

1178

- Now I had to put together
the acts for the tour.

1183

01:01:47,013 --> 01:01:48,532
- I've been a fan of
yours since the first day

1244
01:01:48,566 --> 01:01:50,361
you started broadcasting here.

1245
01:01:50,396 --> 01:01:51,949
My office is upstairs.

1246
01:01:51,984 --> 01:01:53,675
- Let me guess...

1247
01:01:53,710 --> 01:01:55,297
You're a singer.

1248
01:01:55,332 --> 01:01:56,471
- I write songs.

1249
01:01:56,505 --> 01:01:58,680
- What have you written?

1250
01:01:58,715 --> 01:02:00,855
- Nothing you've heard of yet.

1251
01:02:00,889 --> 01:02:04,030
But since you asked,
here's a sample.

1252
01:02:04,065 --> 01:02:05,238
Give it a listen.

1253
01:02:05,273 --> 01:02:08,690
If it doesn't grab
you, no hard feelings.

1254
01:02:12,349 --> 01:02:13,937
- Fair enough.

1255
01:02:13,971 --> 01:02:16,042
- But if it does grab you,

1256
01:02:16,077 --> 01:02:18,700
maybe we could have
coffee sometime?

1257
01:02:27,985 --> 01:02:28,814
- Daddy.

1258
01:02:30,332 --> 01:02:32,024
I'm gonna miss you,
Daddy, so much.

1259
01:02:32,058 --> 01:02:34,992
- Oh, and I'm gonna
miss you, too.

1260
01:02:37,132 --> 01:02:38,478
- All right, say goodbye
to Daddy, he's gotta go.

1261
01:02:38,513 --> 01:02:40,791
- Bye.
- Bye-bye.

1262
01:02:40,826 --> 01:02:41,654
- Bye.

1263
01:02:41,688 --> 01:02:43,035
- Bye, honey.

1264
01:02:43,069 --> 01:02:44,726
Now, you have a schedule.

1265
01:02:44,761 --> 01:02:47,211
I'll have a front row seat
reserved for you at every show.

1266
01:02:47,246 --> 01:02:51,112
You can join us

1267
01:02:51,146 --> 01:02:53,804

Woo!

1323
01:06:48,073 --> 01:06:52,042
- Mr. Hoover, this Alan Freed
has been poisoning the minds

1324
01:06:52,077 --> 01:06:54,251
of young people for years.

1325
01:06:54,286 --> 01:06:56,426
- It's depraved what he does.

1326
01:06:56,460 --> 01:07:00,154
Is there anything subversive
in this Freed's background?

1327
01:07:00,188 --> 01:07:02,052
- He doesn't seem
very political.

1328
01:07:02,087 --> 01:07:05,435
However, he is very friendly
with quite a few Negroes.

1329
01:07:05,469 --> 01:07:06,505
- Hm.

1330
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,783
He sells himself as
some kind of crusader

1331
01:07:08,817 --> 01:07:12,821
for the American teenager,
when what he's really doing

1332
01:07:12,856 --> 01:07:14,823
is corrupting their
morals and turning them

1333
01:07:14,858 --> 01:07:16,998
against their parents.

1334
01:07:17,033 --> 01:07:19,621
Let's get everything
we can on him.

1335
01:07:19,656 --> 01:07:21,934
This rock and roll
scourge may turn out

1336
01:07:21,968 --> 01:07:24,971
to be more dangerous
than communism.

1337
01:07:27,836 --> 01:07:29,873
- The tour was a great success.

1338
01:07:29,907 --> 01:07:31,771
And then we got to Boston.

1339
01:07:31,806 --> 01:07:33,290
It was a sell-out.

1340
01:07:33,325 --> 01:07:35,465
But the powers that
be were out to get me.

1341
01:07:40,504 --> 01:07:45,475

Boston, for a change of pace,

very relaxed performer.

01:11:47,613 --> 01:11:49,408
- Because of Boston?

1417
01:11:49,443 --> 01:11:50,996
The papers said that
people were stabbed

1418
01:11:51,030 --> 01:11:52,411
and robbed and raped.

1419
01:11:52,446 --> 01:11:54,102
- It's all lies!

1420
01:11:54,137 --> 01:11:55,449
But they're still going
to try to indict me

1421
01:11:55,483 --> 01:11:57,174
for inciting a riot.

1422
01:11:58,141 --> 01:11:59,556
- What's Levy gonna do?

1423
01:11:59,591 --> 01:12:01,178
- Probably kill me.

1424
01:12:03,905 --> 01:12:05,321
No, I'll be fine.

1425
01:12:19,576 --> 01:12:20,681
- Boys.

1426
01:12:20,715 --> 01:12:21,992
- Hello, Mo.

1427
01:12:22,027 --> 01:12:23,856
Didn't know you had
a key to my office?

1428
01:12:23,891 --> 01:12:25,410
- I don't.

1429
01:12:25,444 --> 01:12:29,172
Well, we got a
disaster on our hands.

1430
01:12:29,206 --> 01:12:32,071
After we pay off the
talent and expenses,

1431
01:12:32,106 --> 01:12:34,971
I figure you'll be in
the hole about 200 grand.

1432
01:12:35,005 --> 01:12:37,353
- Oh, I'll be in the hole?

1433
01:12:37,387 --> 01:12:38,664
Mm-hmm.

1434
01:12:38,699 --> 01:12:40,701
Well, then we'll just put
on another tour this summer.

1435
01:12:40,735 --> 01:12:42,288
- You're a hot potato right now.

1436
01:12:42,323 --> 01:12:45,153
Nobody'll let you
rent their theaters.

1437
01:12:45,188 --> 01:12:48,191
Alan, this Boston
thing is real bad.

1438
01:12:49,330 --> 01:12:51,781
Everyone is turning
against rock and roll.

1439
01:12:51,815 --> 01:12:53,196
- Not the people
who listen to it.

1440
01:12:53,230 --> 01:12:54,473
And the kids love
it more than ever.

1441
01:12:54,508 --> 01:12:56,544
- The kids don't run
this country, Alan,

1442
01:12:56,579 --> 01:12:58,339
politicians and preachers do.

1443
01:12:58,374 --> 01:13:02,032
You woke up the
F.B.I. and the D.A.

1444
01:13:02,067 --> 01:13:04,897
Right now they got you
in the cross-hairs.

1445
01:13:04,932 --> 01:13:06,382
- So what am I supposed to do?

1446
01:13:06,416 --> 01:13:08,280
Go back to promoting
Benny Goodman concerts?

1447
01:13:08,314 --> 01:13:10,731
- You have any idea how much
money there is to be made here?

1448
01:13:10,765 --> 01:13:14,044
We are riding a wave
and you're blowing it!

1449
01:13:14,079 --> 01:13:16,115
What, I'm blowing it?!

1450
01:13:16,150 --> 01:13:17,427
I invented rock and roll!

1451
01:13:17,462 --> 01:13:18,704
I am rock and roll!

1452
01:13:18,739 --> 01:13:21,086
- You were rock and roll.

1453
01:13:21,120 --> 01:13:22,467
It's even bigger than you now!

1454
01:13:22,501 --> 01:13:24,710
But you keep yourself
so out front,

1455
01:13:24,745 --> 01:13:28,093
they keep shining
that spotlight on you.

1456
01:13:29,681 --> 01:13:33,995
Well, see, we don't want
any bright lights looking

1457
01:13:34,030 --> 01:13:36,135
into our business, do we?

1458
01:13:37,482 --> 01:13:42,245
- You know what, I don't need
to take this crap from you.

1459
01:13:42,279 --> 01:13:43,488
- Excuse me?

1460
01:13:43,522 --> 01:13:45,351
- Get out of my office!

1461
01:13:45,386 --> 01:13:46,629
You hear me?

1462
01:13:46,663 --> 01:13:49,494
You get the hell
out of my office!

1463
01:13:58,226 --> 01:14:01,437
- You should talk
some sense into him.

1464
01:14:08,616 --> 01:14:11,205
- Alan--
- Just leave me alone!

1465
01:14:37,990 --> 01:14:39,336
- Can I come in?

1466
01:14:43,444 --> 01:14:45,584
- Hey, no, no, no, you no...

1467
01:14:45,619 --> 01:14:46,896
- That's okay.

1468
01:14:49,519 --> 01:14:53,972
- Oh, By the way,
I listened to your demo.

1469
01:14:54,006 --> 01:14:56,008
- That's the last thing you
need to be worrying about.

1470
01:14:56,043 --> 01:14:56,871
- No.

1471
01:14:58,114 --> 01:15:00,047
You're really talented.

1472
01:15:02,014 --> 01:15:03,119
It was great.

1473
01:15:04,430 --> 01:15:05,811
- You think so?

1474
01:15:05,846 --> 01:15:06,674
- Yes.

1475
01:15:12,577 --> 01:15:15,925
Hello, everybody, how are you
all doing out there tonight?

1476
01:15:15,959 --> 01:15:19,100
This is Alan Freed,
Mr. Rock and Roll.

1477
01:15:19,135 --> 01:15:21,171
Yeah, I've been off the
air for a little while

1478
01:15:21,206 --> 01:15:23,622
and I just wanna say that
it feels great being back

1479
01:15:23,657 --> 01:15:26,176
in front of this big
microphone again.

1480
01:15:26,211 --> 01:15:28,524
So
without further ado,

1481
01:15:28,558 --> 01:15:31,043
let's play some rock and roll!

1482
01:15:34,495 --> 01:15:36,566
The Boston prosecutor
couldn't prove I was trying

1483
01:15:36,601 --> 01:15:38,982
to overthrow the government,

1484
01:15:39,017 --> 01:15:42,434
so he dropped his
phoney inciting-a-riot

1485
01:15:42,468 --> 01:15:44,574
But the New York
D.A. began looking

1486
01:15:44,609 --> 01:15:46,334
into the record business.

1487
01:15:46,369 --> 01:15:49,855
Were DJs taking money
for playing records?

1488
01:15:50,718 --> 01:15:52,893
They called it payola.

- Oh, that.

1493
01:16:06,631 --> 01:16:08,011
- You know about it?

1494
01:16:08,046 --> 01:16:10,082
- Oh, yeah, they're
the same guys

1495
01:16:10,117 --> 01:16:11,497
that nailed Charlie Van Doren.

1496
01:16:11,532 --> 01:16:13,603

to persecute people

1497

I'm clean.

1501
01:16:19,471 --> 01:16:22,888
- What about that
loan from Morris Levy?

1502
01:16:24,027 --> 01:16:25,615
- They'll never get to Mo.

1503
01:16:25,650 --> 01:16:27,134
- They can get to anyone.

1504
01:16:27,168 --> 01:16:29,136
And when they do, that
means saving his own hide,

1505
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,034
he'll give you up in
a New York minute.

1506
01:16:31,069 --> 01:16:32,484

01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:12,065
- Worried about me?

1592
01:22:12,099 --> 01:22:13,549
Gee, I don't know why.

1593
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:16,103
I only have the F.B.I., the
I.R.S., the New York D.A.

1594
01:22:16,138 --> 01:22:18,692
and the State's Attorney
General breathing down my neck.

1595
01:22:18,726 --> 01:22:21,384
Otherwise, my life is beautiful.

1596
01:22:22,938 --> 01:22:25,078
- Why didn't you call me?

1597
01:22:26,562 --> 01:22:28,219
- Look, you know
what you should do?

1598
01:22:28,253 --> 01:22:32,671
Turn around and walk
away and never look back.

1599
01:22:32,706 --> 01:22:34,915
- Don't treat me like this.

1600
01:22:34,950 --> 01:22:37,642
- Look, Denise, you're
a very nice person

1601
01:22:37,676 --> 01:22:39,816
and you're incredibly talented.

1602
01:22:39,851 --> 01:22:41,784
- This isn't about my career.

1603
01:22:41,818 --> 01:22:43,027
It's about you.

1604
01:22:45,339 --> 01:22:48,066
- It's just not that easy.

1605
01:22:48,101 --> 01:22:49,516
- Don't do this.

1606
01:22:51,380 --> 01:22:52,968
- Goodbye, Denise.

1607
01:23:01,977 --> 01:23:03,461
- Close the door.

1608
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:10,364
I'm releasing you
from your contract.

1609
01:23:10,399 --> 01:23:12,263
- On what grounds?

1610
01:23:12,297 --> 01:23:14,230
- Legally I don't
need any grounds.

1611
01:23:14,265 --> 01:23:17,095
- Do you even like
music, Mr. McCaw?

1612
01:23:17,130 --> 01:23:20,616
- Over the last six months
you've had stand-ins

1613
01:23:20,650 --> 01:23:23,032
cover your program more
than 50% of the time.

1614
01:23:23,067 --> 01:23:25,310
- Who I have paid for
out of my own pocket.

1615
01:23:25,345 --> 01:23:28,037
- And the ratings
have remained high.

1616
01:23:28,072 --> 01:23:30,039
You know why that is?

1617
01:23:30,074 --> 01:23:33,318
Because people want
the music, not you.

1618
01:23:34,457 --> 01:23:36,804
- This is because of payola?!

1619
01:23:36,839 --> 01:23:39,255
You can't stand the heat?!

1620
01:23:39,290 --> 01:23:40,636
I made you rich.

1621
01:23:41,499 --> 01:23:43,397
I built this business!

1622
01:23:43,432 --> 01:23:45,813
- Yeah, that's right.

1623
01:23:45,848 --> 01:23:50,508
But Alan Freed is no longer
a business I want to be in.

1624
01:23:50,542 --> 01:23:53,028
Tonight's your last broadcast.

1625
01:24:02,796 --> 01:24:05,074
- Yours truly here.

1626
01:24:05,109 --> 01:24:06,903
Now, before I play
this last record,

1627
01:24:06,938 --> 01:24:09,216
I have an announcement to make.

1628
01:24:09,251 --> 01:24:12,461
After tonight, I will no
longer be broadcasting

1629
01:24:12,495 --> 01:24:13,841
on this station.

1630
01:24:15,050 --> 01:24:16,879
And as of right
now, I have no idea

1631
01:24:16,913 --> 01:24:19,744
where I'll be broadcasting next.

1632
01:24:19,778 --> 01:24:22,195
I just wanna thank you all
for your wonderful cards

1633
01:24:22,229 --> 01:24:24,369
and letters and your
words of encouragement

1634
01:24:24,404 --> 01:24:27,131
during my time here at W.L.O.R.

1635
01:24:27,165 --> 01:24:30,582
I couldn't have done
it without you...

1636
01:24:30,617 --> 01:24:32,964
All you listening out there.

1637
01:24:34,483 --> 01:24:36,623
I tried to play what
I thought was the best

1638
01:24:36,657 --> 01:24:38,073
in rock and roll.

1639
01:24:40,351 --> 01:24:44,079
And as far as this
payola stuff goes,

1640
01:24:44,113 --> 01:24:46,840
I just want you to know
I never played a record

1641
01:24:46,874 --> 01:24:51,120
that I didn't like. That
is the God honest truth.

1642
01:24:51,155 --> 01:24:53,571
I did consult for
the record companies.

1643
01:24:53,605 --> 01:24:55,538
I told them what I
thought might make it

1644
01:24:55,573 --> 01:24:57,713
and what I thought might not.

1645
01:24:57,747 --> 01:25:01,682
And they paid me for that,
I provided a service.

1646
01:25:01,717 --> 01:25:04,064
Sure I made some mistakes...

1647
01:25:07,136 --> 01:25:09,621
But I never ever took a bribe.

1648
01:25:11,140 --> 01:25:14,730
Now mark my words: when this
is over and my name is cleared,

1649
01:25:14,764 --> 01:25:19,114
I'll be riding through
Central Park on a white horse.

1650
01:25:19,148 --> 01:25:23,256
To those of you out
there who supported me...

1651
01:25:23,290 --> 01:25:24,119
Thank you.

1652
01:25:26,051 --> 01:25:27,639
And to my family...

1653
01:25:29,607 --> 01:25:30,608
I love you.

1654
01:25:33,197 --> 01:25:36,096
And I want you to know
this is not goodbye.

1655
01:25:36,131 --> 01:25:37,891
It is just goodnight.

1656
01:25:37,925 --> 01:25:39,513
We'll see you soon.

1657
01:25:51,215 --> 01:25:56,323
And just remember this: rock
and roll is here to stay.

1658
01:25:56,358 --> 01:25:57,980
