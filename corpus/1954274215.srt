1
00:01:13,305 --> 00:01:16,312
Sensor buried. Stand by
for incoming readings.

2
00:01:21,112 --> 00:01:22,212
It's beautiful Lisa.

3
00:01:22,881 --> 00:01:24,717
Is beautiful even
in your vocabulary?

4
00:01:27,052 --> 00:01:29,121
Seism-sensor readings
are coming in now.

5
00:01:30,622 --> 00:01:32,924
We're definitely
getting some activity,

6
00:01:32,925 --> 00:01:35,626
but Joseph, how is it possible...
Ka'ula hasn't shown

7
00:01:35,627 --> 00:01:38,563
volcanic activity in
five million years.

8
00:01:38,863 --> 00:01:41,370
How is this possible so
far from the hotspot?

9
00:01:45,870 --> 00:01:47,139
Joseph?

10
00:01:47,939 --> 00:01:49,875
Joseph?

11
00:01:50,189 --> 00:01:52,383
Lisa, I think a submerged
volcanic shelf has surfaced.

12
00:01:52,384 --> 00:01:55,616
There are new islands out here.

13
00:02:00,518 --> 00:02:01,678
When does Landon arrive?

14
00:02:01,819 --> 00:02:03,187
He's flying in soon.

15
00:02:03,188 --> 00:02:05,025
We'll need his help
running some tests.

16
00:02:14,666 --> 00:02:16,134
Lisa I got tremors here!

17
00:02:16,934 --> 00:02:19,136
Joseph it's right on top of you!

18
00:02:19,137 --> 00:02:21,749
Go! Now!

19
00:02:30,549 --> 00:02:31,949
Lisa!

20
00:02:31,950 --> 00:02:33,185
Joseph?

21
00:03:09,921 --> 00:03:12,890
Ladies and Gentlemen, the Captain has
turned on the fasten seat belt sign

22
00:03:12,891 --> 00:03:15,459
as we make our descent to Ka'ula.
Please put your tray

23
00:03:15,460 --> 00:03:18,718
tables and seats in their
upright and full position.

24
00:03:40,518 --> 00:03:42,019
Excuse me. Oh!

25
00:03:42,020 --> 00:03:44,806
Um, I'm so sorry sir. We're
preparing to land. Do you mind

26
00:03:44,807 --> 00:03:47,525
bringing your seat forward and
putting your tray table up.

27
00:03:47,526 --> 00:03:49,493
Thank you. I'll take this.

28
00:03:49,494 --> 00:03:51,997
How could you sleep
through this noise?

29
00:03:52,797 --> 00:03:54,209
Practice.

30
00:04:04,009 --> 00:04:07,210
Don't you know it isn't
polite to stare?

31
00:04:07,211 --> 00:04:09,947
Tony! Sit down.

32
00:04:09,948 --> 00:04:12,382
Please. I'm sorry about that.

33
00:04:12,383 --> 00:04:15,121
It's alright. No harm.

34
00:04:15,921 --> 00:04:17,589
Hank right?

35
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,657
You look like a Hank.

36
00:04:20,658 --> 00:04:22,592
Actually is uh...

37
00:04:22,593 --> 00:04:23,693
it's Jim.

38
00:04:23,828 --> 00:04:26,097
Jim Kirkland.

39
00:04:26,098 --> 00:04:27,330
Jennifer.

40
00:04:27,331 --> 00:04:29,700
And you've already met Tony.

41
00:04:29,701 --> 00:04:32,245
Yeah.

42
00:04:42,045 --> 00:04:44,048
How long have you been married?

43
00:04:44,049 --> 00:04:45,983
Oh. We're not yet.

44
00:04:45,984 --> 00:04:48,986
I just like to wear it.

45
00:04:48,987 --> 00:04:51,154
Feel like we are anyway.

46
00:04:51,155 --> 00:04:55,126
I took time my auto body shop to meet
her for a little pre-wedding vacation.

47
00:04:55,127 --> 00:04:58,094
That's nice. You've know
each other a long time then?

48
00:04:58,095 --> 00:04:59,630
Six months.

49
00:04:59,631 --> 00:05:01,965
I know it's a little crazy...

50
00:05:01,966 --> 00:05:05,402
There's nothing crazy about it.
If you don't know it within the

51
00:05:05,403 --> 00:05:09,124
first month that she's the
one then you'll never know.

52
00:05:26,924 --> 00:05:28,892
Control, this is 7389.

53
00:05:28,893 --> 00:05:31,561
We may be experiencing some
technical difficulties,

54
00:05:31,562 --> 00:05:34,698
as our radar shows we're closing in on
what seems to be a heavy storm cloud...

55
00:05:34,699 --> 00:05:39,305
but our reports show very little
turbulence. Can you confirm?

56
00:05:42,105 --> 00:05:44,011
Control, can you confirm?

57
00:05:46,811 --> 00:05:48,382
Radio is malfunctioning.

58
00:05:52,182 --> 00:05:56,422
Control this is 7389 do you copy?

59
00:05:57,222 --> 00:05:58,322
Guess we missed it.

60
00:05:59,057 --> 00:06:00,090
Sir.

61
00:06:00,091 --> 00:06:02,493
Oh. Great um...

62
00:06:02,494 --> 00:06:06,429
My Wi-Fi is acting a little janky. Would you
mind checking it out? See if they can fix it?

63
00:06:06,430 --> 00:06:10,334
No I'm sorry. You actually have to turn
it off and put your tray up for landing.

64
00:06:10,335 --> 00:06:12,170
Oh. Sorry.

65
00:06:12,970 --> 00:06:14,070
It's OK.

66
00:06:14,838 --> 00:06:16,340
Can I take that for you?

67
00:06:16,341 --> 00:06:17,308
Sure thanks.

68
00:06:17,309 --> 00:06:18,409
No problem.

69
00:06:27,085 --> 00:06:28,389
Here.

70
00:06:31,189 --> 00:06:34,291
Please, do you have any aspirin?

71
00:06:34,292 --> 00:06:36,127
No. I'm sorry sir we're out.

72
00:06:36,927 --> 00:06:40,397
Oh god... my head. I hate flying!

73
00:06:40,398 --> 00:06:43,200
My apologies. It's the altitude.

74
00:06:43,201 --> 00:06:45,478
We will be descending soon.

75
00:06:53,278 --> 00:06:54,483
Control?

76
00:06:58,283 --> 00:06:59,383
Captain.

77
00:06:59,917 --> 00:07:01,786
Radio's down.

78
00:07:01,787 --> 00:07:02,887
Down?

79
00:07:03,215 --> 00:07:04,255
That's not what scares me.

80
00:07:04,256 --> 00:07:06,657
What's that?

81
00:07:06,658 --> 00:07:09,595
How long it's been down.

82
00:07:17,367 --> 00:07:21,738
Ladies and gentlemen, we are
experiencing some light... turbulence.

83
00:07:21,739 --> 00:07:24,408
It's OK. It's just an air pocket.

84
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,891
That wasn't an air pocket.

85
00:07:39,691 --> 00:07:41,691
That's not the runway.
Where are we?

86
00:07:41,692 --> 00:07:46,298
Our compass is wrong. There must be
some magnetic interference out there.

87
00:07:47,098 --> 00:07:50,299
Loss of altitude control. The
auto-pilot isn't compensating.

88
00:07:50,300 --> 00:07:51,400
Hold on Spair.

89
00:07:52,970 --> 00:07:55,177
Damn auto-pilot thinks we're
descending on course.

90
00:07:59,977 --> 00:08:01,277
Hey, could you lean back?

91
00:08:01,278 --> 00:08:03,053
What the hell is that?

92
00:08:08,853 --> 00:08:09,953
It's ash.

93
00:08:11,823 --> 00:08:13,356
Auto-Pilot disabled

94
00:08:13,357 --> 00:08:14,924
Now when I tell you...

95
00:08:14,925 --> 00:08:17,430
I need you to lay
down the throttle.

96
00:08:18,230 --> 00:08:19,429
On when I tell you!

97
00:08:19,430 --> 00:08:20,530
I hear ya Captain.

98
00:08:26,170 --> 00:08:28,711
Spair, maximum velocity!

99
00:08:33,511 --> 00:08:35,548
- Come on.
- I'm pushing her.

100
00:08:37,348 --> 00:08:38,683
Come on!

101
00:08:40,952 --> 00:08:42,192
Holly sh...

102
00:08:48,459 --> 00:08:50,026
I can't breathe!

103
00:08:50,027 --> 00:08:51,673
Everyone hang on!

104
00:09:06,978 --> 00:09:08,346
Listen...

105
00:09:09,146 --> 00:09:10,114
Look out!

106
00:09:10,115 --> 00:09:11,215
I see it!

107
00:09:17,856 --> 00:09:19,256
I need you to be on the radio.

108
00:09:47,953 --> 00:09:49,886
Auto-Pilot Engaged

109
00:09:49,887 --> 00:09:51,224
Is everything OK?

110
00:09:53,024 --> 00:09:54,360
Dan!

111
00:09:57,160 --> 00:09:58,630
The code! The code!

112
00:10:00,430 --> 00:10:02,299
For the auto-pilot?

113
00:10:03,099 --> 00:10:05,235
Zero...

114
00:10:05,236 --> 00:10:06,569
Dan!

115
00:10:06,570 --> 00:10:08,041
Zero, Nine...

116
00:10:09,841 --> 00:10:11,408
Dan. Dan!

117
00:10:11,409 --> 00:10:13,544
Dan what is the passcode?

118
00:10:13,545 --> 00:10:15,278
Dan what is the passcode?!

119
00:10:15,279 --> 00:10:17,187
Dan!

120
00:10:23,987 --> 00:10:24,821
Dan come on...

121
00:10:24,822 --> 00:10:26,189
Hey is everything alright?

122
00:10:26,190 --> 00:10:27,256
He-he's not breathing.

123
00:10:27,257 --> 00:10:29,327
Can you help me out...

124
00:10:30,127 --> 00:10:31,431
Oh he's gone.

125
00:10:34,231 --> 00:10:35,465
OK it's on auto-pilot.

126
00:10:35,466 --> 00:10:37,302
- Um Rita?
- Yes.

127
00:10:37,303 --> 00:10:40,417
Rita, get on the radio right there and
get a hold of anybody. Anybody at all.

128
00:10:40,418 --> 00:10:42,558
My name is Rick Pierce.
Do it! Just do it!

129
00:10:43,607 --> 00:10:44,707
Hello?

130
00:10:44,809 --> 00:10:46,510
Can anybody here me?

131
00:10:46,511 --> 00:10:47,645
Hello?

132
00:10:47,646 --> 00:10:49,813
Please help. It's out.

133
00:10:49,814 --> 00:10:51,414
OK yeah. We've been hit.

134
00:10:51,415 --> 00:10:55,426
- You can fly?
- Wait one second. I'll be right back.

135
00:11:03,427 --> 00:11:05,219
- You, what's your name?
- Me? Frank.

136
00:11:05,245 --> 00:11:07,310
Frank come here.
I need your help please.

137
00:11:07,711 --> 00:11:10,435
United States Air
Marshall Kirkland.

138
00:11:11,269 --> 00:11:15,117
- You mind telling me what's going on?
- Yeah, someone's hurt upfront.

139
00:11:27,517 --> 00:11:29,586
Are they dead?

140
00:11:29,587 --> 00:11:32,410
Unconscious. That's all anybody
needs to know right now.

141
00:11:32,424 --> 00:11:34,384
We need the pilot out of his seat.

142
00:11:48,973 --> 00:11:49,672
You OK?

143
00:11:49,673 --> 00:11:51,375
Don't touch me.

144
00:11:52,175 --> 00:11:55,380
I'm sorry. I just
thought you were hurt.

145
00:11:56,013 --> 00:11:58,618
- You sure you're gonna be...
- No.

146
00:12:00,418 --> 00:12:02,475
Well not yet.

147
00:12:24,275 --> 00:12:26,378
He's not really unconscious is he?

148
00:12:27,178 --> 00:12:28,614
He's dead.

149
00:12:28,819 --> 00:12:30,853
Don't let the passengers
see these guys like that.

150
00:12:30,854 --> 00:12:32,115
Gotta get the co-pilot out too.

151
00:12:32,116 --> 00:12:34,936
OK. You got it. I'll keep it quiet.

152
00:12:51,736 --> 00:12:53,470
What's going on?

153
00:12:53,471 --> 00:12:54,571
It's alright.

154
00:12:55,946 --> 00:12:58,180
OK, everybody. I'm Air
Marshall Jim Kirkland.

155
00:12:58,181 --> 00:13:00,977
The pilot is knocked
unconscious but,

156
00:13:00,978 --> 00:13:04,514
everything's OK... If there's
anybody able to give us a hand

157
00:13:04,515 --> 00:13:07,784
with medical training please
help each other out...

158
00:13:07,785 --> 00:13:09,620
That's a volcano!

159
00:13:14,192 --> 00:13:17,871
Hey... I need to know
what you know. I can help.

160
00:13:27,671 --> 00:13:29,845
Show 'em.

161
00:13:46,189 --> 00:13:47,778
Oh my god.

162
00:14:07,578 --> 00:14:09,414
You ever fly anything this big?

163
00:14:10,214 --> 00:14:14,320
No, the largest I've
ever flow is a king air.

164
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:16,720
9 seater.

165
00:14:16,721 --> 00:14:17,994
Great.

166
00:14:22,794 --> 00:14:25,727
It's stuck on auto-pilot
in a constant loop.

167
00:14:25,728 --> 00:14:30,067
Yeah to prevent terrorist takeovers they
installed an encoded auto-pilot system.

168
00:14:30,068 --> 00:14:32,502
And of course he
knew all the codes.

169
00:14:32,503 --> 00:14:35,506
No Mr. Spair knew them too.

170
00:14:36,306 --> 00:14:37,875
Great.

171
00:14:38,675 --> 00:14:41,046
I study volcanoes and uh...
I doubt this is the worst.

172
00:14:41,846 --> 00:14:43,526
In fact I think she's
just waking up.

173
00:14:44,915 --> 00:14:48,617
Keep your distance and don't fly
us too close or you'll cook us.

174
00:14:48,618 --> 00:14:52,591
No chance of that cause of
the auto-pilot loop, right?

175
00:14:54,391 --> 00:14:55,660
Hope so...

176
00:14:57,460 --> 00:14:59,164
Can you move that thing?

177
00:15:00,964 --> 00:15:04,644
There's a little bit of movement in the wheel.
I might be able to force it to maneuver.

178
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,147
No chance of flying over
that thick ash cloud.

179
00:15:11,876 --> 00:15:13,276
That will destroy our engines.

180
00:15:15,979 --> 00:15:17,614
We're gonna have to ride it out.

181
00:15:17,615 --> 00:15:18,715
Yeah.

182
00:15:21,385 --> 00:15:23,490
And pray we don't get
any aftershocks.

183
00:15:32,362 --> 00:15:34,130
Hey Tully! Wait up.

184
00:15:34,131 --> 00:15:35,698
Thatch, what happened to you?

185
00:15:35,699 --> 00:15:37,266
Breakfast in the
mess hall happened.

186
00:15:37,267 --> 00:15:39,401
Yeah and what do I say?
I said don't eat the gravy.

187
00:15:39,402 --> 00:15:42,371
It's biscuits and gravy. You can't
have one without the other.

188
00:15:42,372 --> 00:15:44,372
Just don't let the old
man see you like this.

189
00:15:44,842 --> 00:15:47,379
Look alive Tully! They're
calling all hands.

190
00:15:48,179 --> 00:15:50,746
I overheard colonel Rhyker
mention a vulcanologist.

191
00:15:50,747 --> 00:15:53,501
That doesn't make sense. What does
Rhyker want with a vulcanologist?

192
00:15:53,502 --> 00:15:54,317
Guess will find out.

193
00:15:54,318 --> 00:15:56,285
Do we have radar reading for 0600?

194
00:15:56,286 --> 00:15:57,889
Not yet.

195
00:15:58,689 --> 00:16:01,124
Well your input and information
will be useful Doctor.

196
00:16:01,125 --> 00:16:05,528
If you can please fill in my Executive Officer
Livingston. We can send you on your way.

197
00:16:05,529 --> 00:16:07,904
Aah-ten-hut!

198
00:16:12,704 --> 00:16:14,471
As you were.

199
00:16:14,472 --> 00:16:15,673
Sir,

200
00:16:16,473 --> 00:16:18,433
Doctor Lisa Whitmore
called in the disaster.

201
00:16:20,044 --> 00:16:23,578
Listen doc, if there were any volcanic
activity. We would already know all about it.

202
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:27,085
Sir, we are picking up reading
out there... It's big.

203
00:16:27,885 --> 00:16:29,554
Is it a storm?

204
00:16:30,209 --> 00:16:32,363
Excuse me Colonel but you
are not looking at a storm.

205
00:16:32,364 --> 00:16:34,691
You are looking at
an eruption column.

206
00:16:34,692 --> 00:16:36,693
What?

207
00:16:36,694 --> 00:16:41,197
Kaula has been a dead volcanic island
for millions of years until now.

208
00:16:41,198 --> 00:16:45,901
Colonel, my colleague was on
that island when it erupted.

209
00:16:45,902 --> 00:16:48,170
Please let me help.

210
00:16:48,171 --> 00:16:51,605
If you want to help, you can fill in my XO
with everything you know. Starting with...

211
00:16:51,606 --> 00:16:54,011
How did this dead island
suddenly wake up?

212
00:16:54,811 --> 00:16:57,981
My colleague had a similar theory.

213
00:16:57,982 --> 00:17:00,917
Mt. Kilauea has not shown
activity for over a year.

214
00:17:00,918 --> 00:17:04,921
But after thirty years of activity
that pressure has to go somewhere.

215
00:17:04,922 --> 00:17:11,094
Sometimes there are connecting passages where
heat and pressure travel along the crust.

216
00:17:11,095 --> 00:17:17,166
Massive amounts of pressure are forcing
submerged volcanoes to come to the surface.

217
00:17:17,167 --> 00:17:21,006
Colonel. This is
only the beginning.

218
00:17:21,806 --> 00:17:23,607
And it's only gonna get worse.

219
00:17:24,407 --> 00:17:27,584
I am the best that you have.
You need me here.

220
00:17:33,384 --> 00:17:35,617
Get set up. Keep me informed.

221
00:17:35,618 --> 00:17:37,423
Thank you Sir.

222
00:17:39,223 --> 00:17:42,558
Sir, ten minutes ago I was notified
the Lihue Airport lost contact with

223
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,529
one of their airliners coming in
from LAX forty miles off course.

224
00:17:46,530 --> 00:17:49,031
This would put it minutes
after the eruptions.

225
00:17:49,032 --> 00:17:51,866
They overshot their destination.
They're flying blind into a disaster.

226
00:17:51,867 --> 00:17:53,547
They need immediate
rescue assistance.

227
00:17:55,271 --> 00:17:59,376
I cannot initiate an air rescue over
erupting volcanoes and risk my men.

228
00:17:59,377 --> 00:18:01,944
As of now, this island is
in a state of emergency.

229
00:18:01,945 --> 00:18:04,381
Understood, I can notify the island.
Evacuation can be under

230
00:18:04,382 --> 00:18:06,249
way as soon as you
give the order Sir.

231
00:18:06,250 --> 00:18:08,475
Get on it! Get Johnson on the
ground to handle the evac.

232
00:18:08,476 --> 00:18:10,819
Sir, with your permission I'd
like to assist in the evac.

233
00:18:10,820 --> 00:18:16,561
Specialist, I admire your ambition, but
you're not ready son. Get back to your radio.

234
00:18:18,361 --> 00:18:19,461
Yes sir.

235
00:18:25,202 --> 00:18:26,869
What are you waiting for?

236
00:18:26,870 --> 00:18:28,104
Make your calls.

237
00:18:28,105 --> 00:18:29,205
- Yes sir.
- Yes sir.

238
00:18:33,844 --> 00:18:34,944
OK.

239
00:18:36,813 --> 00:18:37,987
Come on.

240
00:18:42,787 --> 00:18:44,356
Everybody hang on!

241
00:18:57,067 --> 00:18:57,966
Come on.

242
00:18:57,967 --> 00:18:59,613
Pull up! Pull up!

243
00:19:20,290 --> 00:19:23,695
Hey somebody come up here
and help us. He's hurt!

244
00:19:25,495 --> 00:19:26,865
Is everybody OK?

245
00:19:28,665 --> 00:19:30,202
No.

246
00:19:31,002 --> 00:19:33,735
OK do we have a first
aid kit on board?

247
00:19:33,736 --> 00:19:35,203
Yeah. Yeah.

248
00:19:35,204 --> 00:19:36,972
Where's the intercom?

249
00:19:36,973 --> 00:19:38,542
It's right there.

250
00:19:39,342 --> 00:19:42,679
Uh everybody, Just remain calm.

251
00:19:42,680 --> 00:19:46,982
Alright first aid is gonna come
around to those who need it.

252
00:19:46,983 --> 00:19:49,251
The best way to get
through this is to

253
00:19:49,252 --> 00:19:53,258
relax and try to work together..

254
00:19:55,058 --> 00:19:56,934
Good luck.

255
00:20:06,403 --> 00:20:07,503
Oh my arm!

256
00:20:08,873 --> 00:20:10,833
Can you help me to move
this out of the way?

257
00:20:11,475 --> 00:20:12,575
- Aah!
- It's broken.

258
00:20:16,981 --> 00:20:18,147
Hang in there.

259
00:20:18,148 --> 00:20:20,116
- Do it. Do it! Do it!
- OK.

260
00:20:20,117 --> 00:20:22,019
1. 2. 3.

261
00:20:25,121 --> 00:20:26,189
Breathe. Breathe.

262
00:20:26,190 --> 00:20:27,656
Just breathe. Just breathe.

263
00:20:27,657 --> 00:20:28,757
You're OK.

264
00:20:30,027 --> 00:20:31,227
Can you use this as a splint?

265
00:20:31,228 --> 00:20:33,132
You're OK. You get me the ace.

266
00:20:34,932 --> 00:20:36,665
You're OK. You're alright.

267
00:20:36,666 --> 00:20:37,766
We got it.

268
00:20:38,202 --> 00:20:39,538
Who's flying this plane?

269
00:20:42,338 --> 00:20:44,641
Sure ain't a pilot.

270
00:20:44,642 --> 00:20:46,643
Hey what's your problem man?

271
00:20:46,644 --> 00:20:50,949
The pilot has been
unconscious for a while.

272
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:54,952
It doesn't take much to
realize that he's dead.

273
00:20:55,752 --> 00:20:57,787
The pilot's dead?

274
00:20:57,788 --> 00:20:59,754
Hey! Stop it.

275
00:20:59,755 --> 00:21:00,855
Just ignore him.

276
00:21:01,826 --> 00:21:03,386
What about the co-pilot? Is he OK?

277
00:21:05,495 --> 00:21:09,488
Don't waste your breath. They
are dead. Aren't they Rita?

278
00:21:30,288 --> 00:21:34,103
Listen Crieger, do
yourself a favor.

279
00:21:34,929 --> 00:21:39,958
Shut up. Sit down or
I'll put you down.

280
00:21:43,733 --> 00:21:44,980
OK.

281
00:21:57,780 --> 00:21:59,085
Hey. My buddy.

282
00:22:00,885 --> 00:22:01,985
You OK?

283
00:22:03,186 --> 00:22:07,259
I need a favor from you. I need
you to hold on to this for me.

284
00:22:08,059 --> 00:22:09,426
Cool.

285
00:22:10,226 --> 00:22:13,628
And I need you to protect mama.

286
00:22:13,629 --> 00:22:17,269
You do that? I'm counting
on you. Tony macaroni.

287
00:22:19,069 --> 00:22:20,971
Boo-yah.

288
00:22:22,940 --> 00:22:24,442
Thank you.

289
00:22:25,242 --> 00:22:26,583
You're welcome.

290
00:22:33,383 --> 00:22:35,988
You're gonna want to get
your people to Oahu.

291
00:22:37,788 --> 00:22:40,623
You need to get them out
of volcanoes range.

292
00:22:40,624 --> 00:22:42,424
It seems like a good
place to start.

293
00:22:42,425 --> 00:22:43,796
Evac is within the hour.

294
00:22:45,596 --> 00:22:48,798
Good. Secondly, we're going to need to
shoot probe into one of the volcanoes...

295
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,000
If you think I'm going to send
one of my men near those...

296
00:22:51,001 --> 00:22:55,672
All I'm suggesting is to launch a
probe into one of the volcanoes.

297
00:22:55,673 --> 00:22:57,272
So I can better understand them.

298
00:22:57,273 --> 00:22:59,275
What exactly can we
learn from the probe?

299
00:22:59,276 --> 00:23:02,779
Oceanic temperature, Aerial
temperatures, and seismic disturbances.

300
00:23:02,780 --> 00:23:05,384
I may be able to predict
what they'll do next.

301
00:23:07,184 --> 00:23:08,417
That's a go people.

302
00:23:08,418 --> 00:23:10,654
15 minutes to airborne.

303
00:23:11,454 --> 00:23:14,358
Sir. What about the
commercial airline sir?

304
00:23:15,158 --> 00:23:19,462
We may get a visual of it. If we do that
will better help us coordinate a rescue.

305
00:23:19,463 --> 00:23:23,300
Until you get someone on the comm,
focus on your current mission soldier.

306
00:23:24,100 --> 00:23:25,378
Yes, sir.

307
00:23:35,178 --> 00:23:36,745
Work.

308
00:23:36,746 --> 00:23:37,846
Come on.

309
00:23:40,416 --> 00:23:41,516
Of course.

310
00:23:44,855 --> 00:23:47,291
Alright. What exactly are
you doing to that phone?

311
00:23:48,091 --> 00:23:50,326
I'm gutting it... gonna
try to call for help.

312
00:23:50,327 --> 00:23:51,687
Wait wait wait wait a minute.

313
00:23:51,861 --> 00:23:54,062
The phones or the Wi-Fi
they don't work up here.

314
00:23:54,063 --> 00:23:56,231
Well, not entirely.

315
00:23:56,232 --> 00:23:59,306
See all these lines are connected to a
link, which is routed to a satellite,

316
00:23:59,307 --> 00:24:01,069
down to a designated target.

317
00:24:01,070 --> 00:24:04,307
Right now that link is being rejected
because the communications are down.

318
00:24:04,308 --> 00:24:08,743
It's kinda like an unregistered user
trying to get in access, you know?

319
00:24:08,744 --> 00:24:14,986
But if I can by pass that link to the
satellite, I might allow ourselves access.

320
00:24:15,786 --> 00:24:17,118
This will work?

321
00:24:17,119 --> 00:24:19,288
Well, I'll let you know.

322
00:24:19,289 --> 00:24:20,389
OK.

323
00:24:22,092 --> 00:24:24,926
Specialist Tully, What's the
status on the evac of Niihau?

324
00:24:24,927 --> 00:24:27,527
Not great sir. They're running
in to a few snags. The locals

325
00:24:27,831 --> 00:24:30,066
think they can handle
it themselves.

326
00:24:30,067 --> 00:24:33,141
I don't care if they have to drag people
by their feet. Get it taken care of

327
00:24:33,142 --> 00:24:34,770
and get their asses back
to base. Understood?

328
00:24:34,771 --> 00:24:35,637
Sir.

329
00:24:35,638 --> 00:24:37,977
The bird is in-bound.

330
00:24:40,777 --> 00:24:45,719
Niihau control, this is Delta
2-1, approaching targets.

331
00:24:48,519 --> 00:24:49,619
I have visual.

332
00:24:54,124 --> 00:24:56,994
Sir, we have picture.

333
00:24:57,794 --> 00:25:00,296
Delta 2-1 prepared to launch.

334
00:25:00,297 --> 00:25:02,767
Roger that, Delta 2-1.

335
00:25:03,567 --> 00:25:05,433
Interesting...

336
00:25:05,434 --> 00:25:06,935
What?

337
00:25:06,936 --> 00:25:09,038
The lava is superheated
and not very dense.

338
00:25:09,039 --> 00:25:12,109
The lighter the density the most
likely is to stay airborne.

339
00:25:12,909 --> 00:25:15,510
Delta 2-1. You are clear to
launch when you are ready.

340
00:25:15,511 --> 00:25:19,081
Roger. Delta 2-1,
Launching probe in...

341
00:25:19,082 --> 00:25:22,096
3-2-1 Fire!

342
00:25:32,896 --> 00:25:33,962
Direct hit.

343
00:25:33,963 --> 00:25:35,697
Good.

344
00:25:35,698 --> 00:25:37,066
Get him back to base.

345
00:25:37,067 --> 00:25:38,466
Roger that, Delta 2...

346
00:25:38,467 --> 00:25:40,536
Wait! Niihau Control,
I have a visual of...

347
00:25:40,537 --> 00:25:42,203
Delta 2-1 say again.

348
00:25:42,204 --> 00:25:44,442
A thick cloud moving fast!

349
00:25:45,242 --> 00:25:48,478
That cloud isn't just moving fast, it's
clocking in at three hundred knots!

350
00:25:48,479 --> 00:25:50,112
Tell him to get out of there now!

351
00:25:50,113 --> 00:25:52,227
Delta 2-1, return to base!
I repeat, return to base!

352
00:25:52,228 --> 00:25:53,828
Niihau Control... come in.
Come in...

353
00:25:53,849 --> 00:25:57,154
Delta 2-1, get out of there
now! Do you read me?!

354
00:25:57,954 --> 00:26:00,266
Oh my g...

355
00:26:09,066 --> 00:26:10,805
We've lost Captain Elby.

356
00:26:14,605 --> 00:26:18,483
It's still coming! It's thirty thousand
meters from Niihau and closing!

357
00:26:18,509 --> 00:26:21,946
- Twenty thousand meters.
- Who's on the shore?

358
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:24,681
We need to send out our boys!
Evacuate the coastal areas!

359
00:26:24,682 --> 00:26:28,785
It's too late! Call the beach
patrol and have everyone leave now!

360
00:26:29,486 --> 00:26:30,586
Do it!

361
00:26:30,854 --> 00:26:34,522
Sir, what about everyone
living on shore?

362
00:27:06,322 --> 00:27:09,391
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!

363
00:27:09,392 --> 00:27:15,546
Everyone must evacuate the beach quickly
and calmly! This is an emergency!

364
00:27:29,346 --> 00:27:30,446
Colonel.

365
00:27:39,857 --> 00:27:42,859
You're shores are the new Pompeii.

366
00:27:43,659 --> 00:27:48,739
All civilians that are still alive,
get them to safety. Evacuate.

367
00:27:55,539 --> 00:27:56,639
Rita.

368
00:27:56,839 --> 00:27:58,547
Top gun needs you. He has an idea.

369
00:28:03,347 --> 00:28:04,449
Dammit.

370
00:28:05,249 --> 00:28:06,682
Are you OK?

371
00:28:06,683 --> 00:28:08,443
I need you to come
inside for a second.

372
00:28:10,119 --> 00:28:12,989
Alright, I need you to reach
underneath that panel... okay.

373
00:28:12,990 --> 00:28:15,491
Does your hand fit inside there?

374
00:28:15,492 --> 00:28:16,892
Uh, I think so.

375
00:28:16,893 --> 00:28:18,653
OK, look in there
tell me what you see.

376
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,286
Their's a mess in here.

377
00:28:22,700 --> 00:28:24,901
Their's gonna be a circuit
breaker, in there somewhere.

378
00:28:24,902 --> 00:28:27,856
OK. their is like two ways to over
ride this auto pilot, and we lost one.

379
00:28:27,857 --> 00:28:29,605
That is the other one.

380
00:28:29,606 --> 00:28:31,139
Rick, I don't think I can do this.

381
00:28:31,140 --> 00:28:33,715
You can OK. Just reach in
there and feel around.

382
00:28:40,550 --> 00:28:42,992
Careful. careful, careful!

383
00:28:49,792 --> 00:28:52,360
Ah! OK. OK, I think I found
the circuit breaker.

384
00:28:52,361 --> 00:28:53,461
OK.

385
00:28:54,392 --> 00:28:56,432
Oh my God Their's so many
switches. Which one is it?

386
00:28:56,433 --> 00:28:58,749
OK, it's going to look different
than the other switches.

387
00:28:58,750 --> 00:29:00,744
It's gonna either be color
coated or its going to

388
00:29:00,745 --> 00:29:02,425
be a totally different
switch all together.

389
00:29:02,426 --> 00:29:03,826
Do you see anything like that?

390
00:29:04,507 --> 00:29:06,509
Yea, yea... I see it!

391
00:29:06,510 --> 00:29:09,817
OK. I'm gonna do it.

392
00:29:13,617 --> 00:29:15,152
Now!

393
00:29:19,022 --> 00:29:20,390
That's not good.

394
00:29:23,127 --> 00:29:24,432
We're losing fuel.

395
00:29:29,232 --> 00:29:30,731
What, what. I'm sorry.

396
00:29:30,732 --> 00:29:32,635
Grab the wheel.

397
00:29:33,435 --> 00:29:35,070
- I can't!
- Yes you can.

398
00:29:35,071 --> 00:29:38,706
Grab that. Yes you can.
You can do it OK.

399
00:29:38,707 --> 00:29:41,746
Just relax. Hold on.

400
00:29:42,546 --> 00:29:44,453
What is that?

401
00:29:53,902 --> 00:29:55,023
I don't know what I'm doing?

402
00:29:55,024 --> 00:29:58,328
It's OK, just... Ahh! God.

403
00:29:59,128 --> 00:30:00,765
Uh, I'm sorry.

404
00:30:01,036 --> 00:30:03,270
Just if something get's in
your way, then you turn, OK?

405
00:30:03,271 --> 00:30:04,509
OK.

406
00:30:12,309 --> 00:30:13,409
Rick!

407
00:30:14,845 --> 00:30:16,126
Their flying all around us.

408
00:30:17,813 --> 00:30:20,693
As long as you don't flying in them,
I don't care what their doing.

409
00:30:25,521 --> 00:30:26,928
Rick!

410
00:30:31,728 --> 00:30:34,766
OK! OK OK OK.

411
00:30:35,566 --> 00:30:36,732
Rick!

412
00:30:38,568 --> 00:30:40,235
It's getting closer.

413
00:30:40,236 --> 00:30:41,777
Ahh!

414
00:30:47,577 --> 00:30:48,677
OK. I got it.

415
00:30:57,886 --> 00:30:59,324
No more switches for you.

416
00:31:01,124 --> 00:31:05,394
That means that the other
switch has got to be...

417
00:31:05,395 --> 00:31:07,763
Ugh! Great.

418
00:31:07,764 --> 00:31:08,564
What?

419
00:31:08,565 --> 00:31:10,299
Was that not it?

420
00:31:10,300 --> 00:31:12,501
No, no, no. That was it.. But
all the circuit are fried now.

421
00:31:12,502 --> 00:31:16,105
So that means that no way in fixing
this. We're stuck in auto-pilot.

422
00:31:16,905 --> 00:31:18,441
Rick, your hand.

423
00:31:18,442 --> 00:31:19,577
I'll be fine.

424
00:31:21,377 --> 00:31:22,712
That was close.

425
00:31:23,512 --> 00:31:25,347
Yea, It's just the beginning. Look.

426
00:31:25,348 --> 00:31:26,851
And more good news.

427
00:31:27,651 --> 00:31:29,550
How long do we have?

428
00:31:29,551 --> 00:31:31,655
I'd say an hour, at best.

429
00:31:32,455 --> 00:31:33,555
Well what do we do?

430
00:31:35,058 --> 00:31:37,538
We need to check on landing.
See if their's any progress.

431
00:31:43,166 --> 00:31:45,434
Hey genius, how's it going?

432
00:31:45,435 --> 00:31:49,638
Well, I minored in genius but majored
in awesome. It's ready to transmit.

433
00:31:49,639 --> 00:31:50,972
So it works.

434
00:31:50,973 --> 00:31:52,211
Only one way to find out.

435
00:31:55,011 --> 00:31:58,046
Uh, Mayday. Mayday:

436
00:31:58,047 --> 00:32:01,716
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7389.

437
00:32:01,717 --> 00:32:05,554
Flight 7389 requesting immediate
emergency assistance.

438
00:32:05,555 --> 00:32:10,133
I repeat this is fight 7389,
requesting emergency assistance.

439
00:32:16,933 --> 00:32:18,669
This is good.

440
00:32:19,469 --> 00:32:22,029
Do you really want to impress me?
Get somebody on the line.

441
00:32:22,105 --> 00:32:23,205
OK.

442
00:32:23,807 --> 00:32:27,343
Honey, Honey are you OK?

443
00:32:27,344 --> 00:32:29,711
OK. OK.

444
00:32:29,712 --> 00:32:31,548
He'll be OK.

445
00:32:32,348 --> 00:32:37,286
Hey, little buddy. I'll get
you some water, Alright?

446
00:32:37,287 --> 00:32:39,821
Their should be something for
motion sickness, I'll go see.

447
00:32:39,822 --> 00:32:40,922
Oh, OK.

448
00:32:47,498 --> 00:32:51,234
I think our new pilot
is not fit to fly.

449
00:32:52,034 --> 00:32:53,434
Where are you getting at man?

450
00:32:53,435 --> 00:32:54,535
Our pilots are dead.

451
00:32:55,038 --> 00:32:57,705
Rick has endangered us all.

452
00:32:57,706 --> 00:33:01,679
He dumped the fuel and who
know if we have enough.

453
00:33:02,479 --> 00:33:07,226
I say let the auto-pilot do
what it's made to do. Not him!

454
00:33:16,026 --> 00:33:17,996
How does it feel?

455
00:33:19,796 --> 00:33:21,299
Better thank you.

456
00:33:23,099 --> 00:33:25,032
Yeah, let's get 'em!

457
00:33:25,033 --> 00:33:26,133
What the hell is that?

458
00:33:26,802 --> 00:33:28,404
I don't know.

459
00:33:33,809 --> 00:33:35,177
You want some air?

460
00:33:35,178 --> 00:33:37,013
What?

461
00:33:37,014 --> 00:33:38,780
Hey

462
00:33:38,781 --> 00:33:40,782
What the hell are you doing?!

463
00:33:40,783 --> 00:33:42,553
What are you doing?

464
00:33:48,058 --> 00:33:49,528
You bastard!

465
00:33:52,328 --> 00:33:54,762
What the hell is going on here?
What is this?

466
00:33:54,763 --> 00:33:56,531
Your ejection.

467
00:33:56,532 --> 00:33:57,632
My what?

468
00:34:06,608 --> 00:34:07,746
Open It.

469
00:34:09,546 --> 00:34:11,047
No!

470
00:34:11,048 --> 00:34:14,884
This man has endangered
us all. Open it!

471
00:34:14,885 --> 00:34:18,289
I am not gonna throw
him off a plane.

472
00:34:19,089 --> 00:34:25,998
You are not with me then... you
will join him. Open the door!

473
00:34:28,798 --> 00:34:31,869
Crieger!!

474
00:34:32,669 --> 00:34:34,840
Drop... it!

475
00:34:37,640 --> 00:34:39,208
Everybody!

476
00:34:40,008 --> 00:34:42,786
Back in the cabin! Move!

477
00:34:50,586 --> 00:34:52,688
Rick... Fly.

478
00:34:52,689 --> 00:34:53,925
Yes sir.

479
00:34:55,725 --> 00:35:02,197
That man has repeatedly saved lives
and you're gonna attack him?

480
00:35:02,198 --> 00:35:04,769
He's killed us all.

481
00:35:06,569 --> 00:35:09,942
Just give me on reason and
I'll blow your head right now.

482
00:35:11,742 --> 00:35:13,311
There are children watching.

483
00:35:16,111 --> 00:35:17,581
You're right.

484
00:35:18,381 --> 00:35:20,047
You want to throw a
man out the door?

485
00:35:20,048 --> 00:35:21,253
Good role model.

486
00:35:23,053 --> 00:35:26,157
I know where exactly
where to shut you down.

487
00:35:27,957 --> 00:35:29,057
Sit.

488
00:35:38,834 --> 00:35:42,271
What did you think was going to
happen when you open the door,

489
00:35:42,272 --> 00:35:45,177
when the cabin wasn't
depressurized?

490
00:35:47,977 --> 00:35:49,481
Think about that.

491
00:35:52,281 --> 00:35:54,014
And don't mind the smell.

492
00:35:54,015 --> 00:35:55,621
Watch Rick.

493
00:35:57,421 --> 00:35:58,152
What?

494
00:35:58,153 --> 00:36:00,121
I said watch Rick.

495
00:36:00,122 --> 00:36:02,159
And watch him close.

496
00:36:02,959 --> 00:36:08,005
Keeping me in here isn't gonna stop
him from killing us all Marshall.

497
00:36:19,042 --> 00:36:21,144
You have a beautiful family.

498
00:36:22,944 --> 00:36:24,887
Where are they now?

499
00:36:31,687 --> 00:36:32,787
He's detained.

500
00:36:33,055 --> 00:36:34,733
Good.

501
00:36:44,533 --> 00:36:45,633
You OK?

502
00:36:46,267 --> 00:36:49,005
Yeah. Thank you for that.

503
00:36:49,805 --> 00:36:50,905
My pleasure.

504
00:36:52,809 --> 00:36:56,911
I'ma ask you this only once...

505
00:36:56,912 --> 00:36:59,548
And you tell me the truth.

506
00:37:00,348 --> 00:37:05,893
Can - you - fly - this - plane?

507
00:37:11,693 --> 00:37:12,797
Yes.

508
00:37:13,597 --> 00:37:15,733
I can.

509
00:37:17,533 --> 00:37:19,536
I don't care about anything else.

510
00:37:20,336 --> 00:37:25,744
Just don't get us killed.

511
00:37:28,544 --> 00:37:31,280
Someone should have heard the
distress call by now, right?

512
00:37:32,080 --> 00:37:33,518
The kid's trying.

513
00:37:35,318 --> 00:37:37,695
No doubt about that.

514
00:37:46,495 --> 00:37:51,699
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389
requesting immediate emergency assistance.

515
00:37:51,700 --> 00:37:53,610
Do you copy?

516
00:38:00,410 --> 00:38:05,980
Mayday. Mayday.
This is flight 7-3-8-9.

517
00:38:05,981 --> 00:38:10,226
Requesting immediate emergency assistance.

518
00:38:17,026 --> 00:38:21,663
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389

519
00:38:21,664 --> 00:38:23,300
Do you copy?

520
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:29,110
Please somebody pick up.

521
00:38:33,910 --> 00:38:35,010
Tully?

522
00:38:36,946 --> 00:38:40,715
Mayday. Mayday this is flight 7389

523
00:38:40,716 --> 00:38:41,816
Do you copy?

524
00:38:43,385 --> 00:38:47,559
Tully, what was the Flight number
on that lost airliner again?

525
00:38:49,359 --> 00:38:53,260
Flight 7389. Why?

526
00:38:53,261 --> 00:38:55,467
I think I just found them.

527
00:38:58,267 --> 00:38:59,735
Colonel Rhyker, sir.

528
00:38:59,736 --> 00:39:02,871
The airliner, we've made contact.

529
00:39:02,872 --> 00:39:04,440
Sir!

530
00:39:05,240 --> 00:39:07,579
You're gonna wanna hear this.

531
00:39:09,379 --> 00:39:14,748
Mayday, mayday. This is Flight 7389
requesting emergency assistance.

532
00:39:14,749 --> 00:39:16,384
That's Landon! That's his flight.

533
00:39:16,385 --> 00:39:18,052
You know him?

534
00:39:18,053 --> 00:39:20,327
He's a friend. Was supposed
to fly in today and meet us.

535
00:39:20,328 --> 00:39:21,456
- Vaughn, get a hold of them!
- Yes sir!

536
00:39:21,457 --> 00:39:22,456
Where are they?

537
00:39:22,457 --> 00:39:23,391
That's the thing, sir...

538
00:39:23,392 --> 00:39:24,445
Thatch.

539
00:39:24,446 --> 00:39:25,630
Yes sir.

540
00:39:28,430 --> 00:39:30,465
They're in the 7th circle of hell.

541
00:39:30,466 --> 00:39:32,268
They're lucky to be alive.

542
00:39:33,068 --> 00:39:35,302
You've gotta do something!

543
00:39:35,303 --> 00:39:38,340
We are in the middle of evacuating everyone
off the island. That's our priority.

544
00:39:38,341 --> 00:39:43,646
With all due respect sir, this is how we make
it right. We save as many as we possibly can.

545
00:39:43,647 --> 00:39:45,947
Even if we initiate an
evac rescue mission...

546
00:39:45,948 --> 00:39:51,353
the probability that we'll even
penetrate that wall of fire is unlike.

547
00:39:51,354 --> 00:39:56,625
Honestly, we're talking about a
random erupting wall. It's risky.

548
00:39:56,626 --> 00:39:58,297
But I'm not saying it's impossible.

549
00:40:01,097 --> 00:40:03,364
Flight 7-3-8-9. come in - 89.

550
00:40:03,365 --> 00:40:06,245
This is the Niihau Joint Task Force
Operations Center, do you read?

551
00:40:06,803 --> 00:40:09,806
I've got someone...
I've got someone!

552
00:40:11,606 --> 00:40:13,943
Someone's transmitting to us.

553
00:40:14,743 --> 00:40:19,748
Uh, yes, hello? Come in.
This is flight 7389!

554
00:40:19,749 --> 00:40:23,885
You're alive! Who is
this, is this Landon?

555
00:40:23,886 --> 00:40:29,958
Yes. This is Landon. How do
you know me? You know me?

556
00:40:29,959 --> 00:40:34,231
That's right. Your colleague
Dr. Whitmore is here.

557
00:40:35,031 --> 00:40:36,766
Lisa. Boy do I owe you.

558
00:40:38,566 --> 00:40:44,239
OK Listen. My name is Private Vaugh. Can
you tell me what your situation status is?

559
00:40:44,240 --> 00:40:46,007
Uh sure. Situation status.

560
00:40:46,008 --> 00:40:48,909
Uh... We lost both our pilots.

561
00:40:48,910 --> 00:40:50,579
Uh, we nearly crashed.

562
00:40:50,580 --> 00:40:54,382
We nearly blew up, and there's
this guys up here who's is

563
00:40:54,383 --> 00:40:56,884
super close to a
psychotic melt down.

564
00:40:56,885 --> 00:41:01,489
Oh! And we're flying in the
middle of a ring of volcanoes.

565
00:41:01,490 --> 00:41:03,728
You have thoughts?

566
00:41:05,528 --> 00:41:09,065
Roger that. What's your
altitude and your fuel like?

567
00:41:09,865 --> 00:41:11,599
Uh, what's our altitude?

568
00:41:11,600 --> 00:41:15,103
Uh, around 10,000 feet.

569
00:41:15,104 --> 00:41:19,708
We're around 10,000 feet... but
we have lost a lot of fuel.

570
00:41:19,709 --> 00:41:22,376
OK. Roger that Landon.
Sit tight for a second.

571
00:41:22,377 --> 00:41:24,378
OK sure.

572
00:41:24,379 --> 00:41:26,614
Tully Sir.

573
00:41:26,615 --> 00:41:28,985
They're outta fuel.

574
00:41:29,785 --> 00:41:31,391
Patch 'em through.

575
00:41:35,191 --> 00:41:38,092
Landon? It's Lisa.

576
00:41:39,629 --> 00:41:42,364
Lisa, It's good to hear your voice.

577
00:41:42,365 --> 00:41:43,898
Just hang in OK?

578
00:41:43,899 --> 00:41:45,632
Your gonna be fine.

579
00:41:45,633 --> 00:41:48,036
OK, we'll do our best.

580
00:41:48,037 --> 00:41:50,137
And Landon...

581
00:41:50,138 --> 00:41:52,974
Who rocks?

582
00:41:52,975 --> 00:41:54,708
You rock.

583
00:41:54,709 --> 00:41:56,911
Landon, you're outta fuel?

584
00:41:56,912 --> 00:42:02,483
Not yet but uh, we don't have a lot left.
I'd say probably less then an hour.

585
00:42:02,484 --> 00:42:05,719
OK Landon. This is
colonel Rhyker...

586
00:42:05,720 --> 00:42:08,391
He's gonna tell you what to do.

587
00:42:11,260 --> 00:42:12,460
Son...

588
00:42:12,461 --> 00:42:14,362
Just relax.

589
00:42:14,363 --> 00:42:16,730
Keep everyone calm and sit tight.

590
00:42:16,731 --> 00:42:19,485
We're gonna do everything in our
power to get you out of there safe.

591
00:42:19,486 --> 00:42:20,487
OK just one thing I...

592
00:42:20,803 --> 00:42:25,072
Based on my readings of the
quake I don't think we have a

593
00:42:25,073 --> 00:42:27,108
Landon?

594
00:42:27,109 --> 00:42:28,275
Landon?

595
00:42:28,276 --> 00:42:29,376
We've lost comm. Sir.

596
00:42:29,845 --> 00:42:31,248
Dammit!

597
00:42:32,048 --> 00:42:33,768
The ash cloud is
causing interference.

598
00:42:35,350 --> 00:42:36,450
Sir!

599
00:42:37,453 --> 00:42:39,127
I am urging you to
reconsider the rescue.

600
00:42:39,128 --> 00:42:40,721
Stand Special.

601
00:42:40,722 --> 00:42:43,036
Those people will die up there
if you don't do something!

602
00:42:43,037 --> 00:42:44,492
Then they're dead in the air!

603
00:42:44,493 --> 00:42:47,628
I give the orders around here.

604
00:42:47,629 --> 00:42:49,764
And my men are not dying today.

605
00:42:49,765 --> 00:42:51,199
Colonel do you think...

606
00:42:51,200 --> 00:42:54,469
Speak out of line one more time.

607
00:42:54,470 --> 00:42:59,510
And you will be begging me for a
court-Martial when I'm done with you.

608
00:43:00,310 --> 00:43:02,177
Yes...

609
00:43:02,178 --> 00:43:03,280
Sir!

610
00:43:06,080 --> 00:43:09,719
If you boys are done,
I've got something.

611
00:43:10,519 --> 00:43:13,267
Our probe is picking up
rising sea temperatures

612
00:43:13,293 --> 00:43:16,324
and seismic activity in
ascending intervals.

613
00:43:16,425 --> 00:43:17,559
What does that mean?

614
00:43:17,560 --> 00:43:19,626
Meaning it's counting down.

615
00:43:19,627 --> 00:43:21,563
Counting down to what?

616
00:43:21,564 --> 00:43:23,831
Well considering the quake's
source, duration, and magnitude...

617
00:43:23,832 --> 00:43:29,471
The crust can only take so much pressure
before magma builds and punches through.

618
00:43:29,472 --> 00:43:31,206
You mean another eruption?

619
00:43:31,207 --> 00:43:34,543
Yeah. Yeah more massive
than all the others.

620
00:43:35,343 --> 00:43:36,443
And then what?

621
00:43:38,914 --> 00:43:41,784
We lose.

622
00:43:44,720 --> 00:43:47,362
Colonel could I talk to you
over here for a second.

623
00:43:54,162 --> 00:43:55,706
Come with me.

624
00:44:04,506 --> 00:44:06,407
We are saving those people.

625
00:44:06,408 --> 00:44:08,041
Period.

626
00:44:08,042 --> 00:44:11,112
But we don't have authorization
from Colonel Rhyker.

627
00:44:11,113 --> 00:44:12,547
We do now.

628
00:44:12,548 --> 00:44:14,514
Besides, Rhyker's
busy with the island.

629
00:44:14,515 --> 00:44:16,617
That looks like the real thing.

630
00:44:16,618 --> 00:44:19,286
Rhyker can't save them but we can.

631
00:44:19,287 --> 00:44:22,325
I am not letting anybody
else die today understood?

632
00:44:22,925 --> 00:44:28,061
The people I care about are on that plane.
So you can't do this without my help.

633
00:44:28,062 --> 00:44:29,297
OK.

634
00:44:29,298 --> 00:44:31,366
First...

635
00:44:31,367 --> 00:44:33,639
We get that tanker.

636
00:44:50,553 --> 00:44:51,659
That's not good.

637
00:44:57,459 --> 00:44:58,628
The engine is jammed.

638
00:44:59,428 --> 00:45:01,500
Something is lodged inside.

639
00:45:04,300 --> 00:45:05,421
I'm gonna talk to Rick.

640
00:45:07,035 --> 00:45:08,371
Wait. What?

641
00:45:09,171 --> 00:45:10,775
Everything's OK.

642
00:45:12,575 --> 00:45:13,675
It's OK.

643
00:45:19,147 --> 00:45:20,247
Tell me right now...

644
00:45:21,724 --> 00:45:23,758
Can you level this plane
with that engine clogged?

645
00:45:23,759 --> 00:45:25,552
No. Not unless...

646
00:45:25,553 --> 00:45:27,188
We fix it.

647
00:45:27,189 --> 00:45:28,556
Yeah but how?

648
00:45:28,557 --> 00:45:30,157
You send me out there.

649
00:45:30,158 --> 00:45:32,731
I can unclog that and get it going.

650
00:45:35,531 --> 00:45:38,000
Can we even open that door?

651
00:45:38,001 --> 00:45:42,536
Well we're at 10,000 feet and if I ease
back on the throttle, Yeah we can.

652
00:45:42,537 --> 00:45:44,505
What? Are you serious?

653
00:45:44,506 --> 00:45:46,311
You have a better idea?

654
00:45:48,111 --> 00:45:51,949
I need my bag. It
has my tools in it.

655
00:45:52,749 --> 00:45:56,284
Even if you do unclog it, that engine will
immediately try to suck you right back in.

656
00:45:56,285 --> 00:45:57,586
I'm seeing my wife.

657
00:45:58,386 --> 00:46:00,224
And going on vacation.

658
00:46:02,024 --> 00:46:07,829
I took time of my job, where I'm more likely
to get flattened, working on a car, she says.

659
00:46:08,629 --> 00:46:10,507
This isn't any different.

660
00:46:27,917 --> 00:46:29,753
You sure about this?

661
00:46:30,553 --> 00:46:32,322
What choice do we have?

662
00:46:34,122 --> 00:46:35,527
Ready?

663
00:46:38,327 --> 00:46:39,637
Go.

664
00:46:48,437 --> 00:46:50,440
Lift it up like this.

665
00:46:51,240 --> 00:46:52,340
OK.

666
00:47:06,921 --> 00:47:12,664
OK here we go! Steady!
Easy easy. Hold steady!

667
00:47:19,401 --> 00:47:21,543
I'm on my way baby.

668
00:47:49,597 --> 00:47:51,099
Hold on tight.

669
00:47:51,100 --> 00:47:52,382
Easy!

670
00:48:18,060 --> 00:48:19,231
Alright.

671
00:48:22,031 --> 00:48:23,131
Hold it!

672
00:48:45,086 --> 00:48:46,521
Come on!

673
00:48:46,522 --> 00:48:47,622
Come on.

674
00:48:47,823 --> 00:48:49,625
Come on!

675
00:48:55,664 --> 00:48:56,797
I got it!

676
00:48:56,798 --> 00:48:57,932
I got it!

677
00:49:04,740 --> 00:49:05,640
Pull 'em in!

678
00:49:05,641 --> 00:49:06,673
Easy does it.

679
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,786
OK! Easy!

680
00:50:04,867 --> 00:50:06,717
It's OK. It's OK.

681
00:50:21,517 --> 00:50:22,617
Frank's gone.

682
00:50:24,285 --> 00:50:25,385
I know.

683
00:50:25,921 --> 00:50:27,193
And we're loosing altitude.

684
00:50:30,993 --> 00:50:32,992
They're taking a beating up there.

685
00:50:32,993 --> 00:50:37,900
Sir, we've got an inbound bogey...
multiple bogeys heading right for us.

686
00:50:43,705 --> 00:50:44,505
Hello?

687
00:50:44,506 --> 00:50:46,641
Is anyone there?

688
00:50:47,810 --> 00:50:50,612
We just lost someone and 2
of our engines are out.

689
00:50:50,613 --> 00:50:52,679
Do you copy?

690
00:50:52,680 --> 00:50:54,583
Is anyone there?

691
00:50:55,783 --> 00:50:58,954
Dammit. Why isn't anyone answering?

692
00:50:59,754 --> 00:51:01,755
Hello? Is anyone there?

693
00:51:01,756 --> 00:51:03,360
We read you!

694
00:51:04,794 --> 00:51:07,668
It's possible for a 747 to fly on two
engines but you may be too heavy.

695
00:51:07,669 --> 00:51:10,189
You lose another one and you'll
glide down and eventually crash.

696
00:51:10,190 --> 00:51:11,932
What about the luggage?
We can dump all that.

697
00:51:11,933 --> 00:51:13,768
Do it! We're getting
hit hard over here.

698
00:51:13,769 --> 00:51:16,572
All hands. Get those
injured inside!

699
00:51:22,410 --> 00:51:25,181
Code Red! Take cover!

700
00:51:29,986 --> 00:51:31,786
Incoming!

701
00:51:50,439 --> 00:51:51,959
This is never gonna work.

702
00:52:07,323 --> 00:52:09,791
What do people put
in their luggage?

703
00:52:09,792 --> 00:52:13,300
Get the wounded inside!
get inside now!

704
00:52:30,678 --> 00:52:31,778
Thatch come here!

705
00:52:32,847 --> 00:52:34,687
Grab him from the other side.
Get him up!

706
00:52:35,917 --> 00:52:37,657
Aah!

707
00:52:42,457 --> 00:52:45,059
- Get him inside!
- I'm on my way now!

708
00:52:45,060 --> 00:52:46,594
I'm not going anywhere.

709
00:52:46,595 --> 00:52:49,304
Tully! Tully we need your help!
Come with me.

710
00:52:55,104 --> 00:52:56,204
That should do it.

711
00:52:56,972 --> 00:52:58,206
Everything's gone.

712
00:52:58,207 --> 00:52:59,307
Did it do anything?

713
00:53:01,010 --> 00:53:04,884
Nope. We're still too heavy.

714
00:53:48,857 --> 00:53:50,224
Hey.

715
00:53:50,225 --> 00:53:51,891
No word from base yet.

716
00:53:51,892 --> 00:53:53,929
We're still too heavy.

717
00:53:54,729 --> 00:53:57,797
If I were a plane what
could I get rid of?

718
00:53:57,798 --> 00:54:01,034
Something that's useless
and we no longer need.

719
00:54:01,035 --> 00:54:02,871
Crieger would be nice.

720
00:54:02,872 --> 00:54:03,972
Look out!

721
00:54:14,348 --> 00:54:15,487
Sit down. Buckle up.

722
00:54:19,287 --> 00:54:21,695
Ladies and gentlemen take
your seats and buckle up.

723
00:54:21,721 --> 00:54:23,888
This is about to get
very interesting.

724
00:54:28,763 --> 00:54:29,863
What are you doing?

725
00:54:30,545 --> 00:54:32,139
Getting rid of some
unwanted equipment.

726
00:54:32,140 --> 00:54:33,806
What?

727
00:54:38,606 --> 00:54:42,141
Rick, listen to me! You can't do this!
You're gonna get us killed!

728
00:54:42,142 --> 00:54:43,010
Not today!

729
00:54:43,011 --> 00:54:44,785
I have a lot of things that
I want to do with my life.

730
00:54:44,811 --> 00:54:47,280
- I'm begging you please. Do not this!
- Here it comes.

731
00:54:47,281 --> 00:54:48,652
No no no no no!

732
00:54:58,160 --> 00:55:00,501
You are going to kill us!

733
00:55:15,343 --> 00:55:18,145
How do you not do
this professionally?!

734
00:55:18,146 --> 00:55:21,485
I buckle under official status.

735
00:55:23,285 --> 00:55:25,119
We stopped descending at 4,000 ft.

736
00:55:25,120 --> 00:55:27,364
Whoo!

737
00:55:35,164 --> 00:55:36,298
Excuse me Colonel?

738
00:55:37,098 --> 00:55:38,268
May I ask you something?

739
00:55:39,068 --> 00:55:40,000
Over here?

740
00:55:40,001 --> 00:55:41,603
Let's make it quick.

741
00:55:47,642 --> 00:55:49,210
Hey are you there?

742
00:55:49,211 --> 00:55:50,846
Yeah. I've been
trying to reach you.

743
00:55:50,847 --> 00:55:52,413
We managed to level the plane out.

744
00:55:52,414 --> 00:55:53,547
How did you do that?

745
00:55:53,548 --> 00:55:56,282
Uh, we took off 2 of the engines?

746
00:55:56,283 --> 00:55:59,054
Uh, Wow! Uh,...

747
00:55:59,854 --> 00:56:01,956
OK what's you altitude?

748
00:56:01,957 --> 00:56:03,860
4,000 ft.

749
00:56:04,000 --> 00:56:07,034
That's cutting it a little too close
for our tanker. We're calling him off.

750
00:56:07,035 --> 00:56:08,836
Don't worry. We still
have rescue coming.

751
00:56:10,499 --> 00:56:12,419
Call of the tanker.
It's way too dangerous.

752
00:56:12,834 --> 00:56:15,637
Hope you're getting
some one equally crazy.

753
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,405
Don't worry. We're
getting our best.

754
00:56:18,406 --> 00:56:21,010
Alright. What's your ETA?
When can I expect ya?

755
00:56:21,810 --> 00:56:23,311
Give me 15 minutes.

756
00:56:23,312 --> 00:56:25,380
15 minutes? OK that's
cutting it a little close.

757
00:56:25,381 --> 00:56:27,114
I think we've only got about 30.

758
00:56:27,115 --> 00:56:28,114
Roger that.

759
00:56:28,115 --> 00:56:29,793
Tully out.

760
00:56:38,593 --> 00:56:41,630
Please let me be wrong.

761
00:56:42,430 --> 00:56:44,099
This is Ronald 2-5 inbound.

762
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:46,467
Roger that bravo 2-5.

763
00:56:46,468 --> 00:56:47,867
Boys be careful out there huh?

764
00:56:47,868 --> 00:56:49,773
Roger control.

765
00:56:51,573 --> 00:56:53,574
Targets in sight, Niihau control.

766
00:56:53,575 --> 00:56:57,411
Roger that, Bravo 2-5.
Tread lightly once inside.

767
00:56:57,412 --> 00:56:58,512
Walk in the park.

768
00:56:58,847 --> 00:57:02,286
I see an opening, control.
Bravo 2- 5 going in.

769
00:57:05,086 --> 00:57:06,188
Control, we're in.

770
00:57:07,782 --> 00:57:10,096
Roger that, Bravo 2-5. Do you
have visual of the package?

771
00:57:10,097 --> 00:57:13,226
Roger, control. We have visual.

772
00:57:13,227 --> 00:57:16,431
Roger that. Good luck.

773
00:57:16,432 --> 00:57:19,268
Bravo 2-5 setting her
under the cargo hold.

774
00:57:20,068 --> 00:57:21,304
Landon?

775
00:57:22,751 --> 00:57:24,945
A rescue plane is right blow you.
You're gonna have to

776
00:57:24,946 --> 00:57:26,866
lower passengers from your
cargo hold understand?

777
00:57:26,867 --> 00:57:28,882
OK I'm getting everyone
together right now.

778
00:57:33,682 --> 00:57:36,150
Help's here. They want
us in the cargo hold.

779
00:57:36,151 --> 00:57:37,317
You're kidding?

780
00:57:37,318 --> 00:57:39,454
No. I don't joke about rescues.

781
00:57:39,455 --> 00:57:40,688
Alright, I'll catch up.

782
00:57:40,689 --> 00:57:43,056
Bravo 2-5. Collecting the package.

783
00:57:43,057 --> 00:57:44,394
Roger that.

784
00:57:58,539 --> 00:58:00,043
Let's go let's go let's go!

785
00:58:02,843 --> 00:58:04,547
OK, ready?

786
00:58:05,347 --> 00:58:06,681
Alright.

787
00:58:07,429 --> 00:58:09,423
We are receiving our
first passenger.

788
00:58:09,424 --> 00:58:11,489
Roger that Bravo 2-5.

789
00:58:15,289 --> 00:58:16,222
Are you good?

790
00:58:16,223 --> 00:58:17,383
Stay right here alright?

791
00:58:18,026 --> 00:58:21,733
Control, we're losing
daylight out here.

792
00:58:24,533 --> 00:58:27,875
You'll be alright. You got it.

793
00:58:33,675 --> 00:58:34,844
Man.

794
00:58:37,413 --> 00:58:39,487
We're experiencing some
lighting over here control.

795
00:58:39,488 --> 00:58:42,018
Roger that Bravo 2-5.
What do you got?

796
00:58:42,818 --> 00:58:46,587
The ash cloud's giving off some
heavy electrical activity.

797
00:58:46,588 --> 00:58:49,690
Bravo 2-5 double time it. Copy?

798
00:58:49,691 --> 00:58:51,625
You!

799
00:58:51,626 --> 00:58:54,860
Sir! We're getting the passengers on the
rescue plane. Vaughn pull up on screen.

800
00:58:54,861 --> 00:58:56,597
Double-time it.

801
00:58:57,397 --> 00:58:58,497
Alright, ready buddy?

802
00:58:58,867 --> 00:59:00,567
Give us two minutes, sir, please!

803
00:59:00,568 --> 00:59:04,070
Alright at the count of 3. 1...

804
00:59:04,071 --> 00:59:05,507
2...

805
00:59:10,544 --> 00:59:12,114
Control, we are hit!

806
00:59:17,885 --> 00:59:20,434
We're going down! We're going down!

807
00:59:33,234 --> 00:59:35,172
Explain yourself specialist.

808
00:59:37,972 --> 00:59:39,674
Sir...

809
00:59:39,675 --> 00:59:42,349
You really thought this could work?
By deliberately disobeying me?

810
00:59:42,350 --> 00:59:44,510
And by forging orders
to issue this mission?

811
00:59:44,511 --> 00:59:47,880
You and your team are
relieved of duty.

812
00:59:47,881 --> 00:59:48,748
Sir...

813
00:59:48,749 --> 00:59:50,251
You will be court martialed.

814
00:59:51,051 --> 00:59:53,152
Now get to your station
and wait there.

815
00:59:53,153 --> 00:59:54,393
The MP's are on their way.

816
00:59:54,856 --> 00:59:57,623
And get that off the screen.

817
00:59:57,624 --> 00:59:59,474
Get it off!

818
01:00:29,925 --> 01:00:31,058
Hey everyone.

819
01:00:31,059 --> 01:00:33,726
Umm...

820
01:00:33,727 --> 01:00:37,567
I got this thing to
transmit and uh...

821
01:00:38,367 --> 01:00:42,268
If you have something that
you want to say to someone,

822
01:00:42,269 --> 01:00:43,489
Feel free.

823
01:01:00,289 --> 01:01:03,027
Is there anyone that you
want to say something to?

824
01:01:06,827 --> 01:01:14,434
It's not over! I don't understand how
you can stand there and think that!

825
01:01:14,435 --> 01:01:16,172
How could you not?

826
01:01:16,972 --> 01:01:20,110
Just let me fly.

827
01:01:22,910 --> 01:01:24,356
OK.

828
01:01:35,156 --> 01:01:36,556
MP!

829
01:01:36,557 --> 01:01:38,195
Remove that man!

830
01:01:40,995 --> 01:01:42,262
Colonel...

831
01:01:42,263 --> 01:01:45,168
- You can't do this!
- I don't want to hear it.

832
01:01:46,968 --> 01:01:50,505
No. No! You don't understand!

833
01:01:50,514 --> 01:01:53,548
Something within the ring of the
volcano is growing rapidly.

834
01:01:53,649 --> 01:01:57,076
- I'm warning you doctor.
- Colonel just... just look.

835
01:01:57,077 --> 01:02:01,481
The pressure...is all
congregating in one spot.

836
01:02:01,482 --> 01:02:06,152
And it's only a matter of time before
this thing rises. And it's big!

837
01:02:06,153 --> 01:02:09,623
Roughly 3 miles in diameter.
Just look! Take a look.

838
01:02:09,624 --> 01:02:11,590
You're done! MP?

839
01:02:11,591 --> 01:02:13,659
- You need to hear this!
- Take 'em both away.

840
01:02:13,660 --> 01:02:15,635
- No! Wait! You don't understand!
- Just look!

841
01:02:15,830 --> 01:02:19,101
Vaughn patch it through!

842
01:02:19,901 --> 01:02:22,538
Hi my name is Landon Todd.

843
01:02:23,338 --> 01:02:26,876
I hope somebody's
listening to this.

844
01:02:27,676 --> 01:02:30,045
I never got to see my dad much...

845
01:02:31,845 --> 01:02:36,253
Not a day goes by that I wish I just
spent more time being with him.

846
01:02:38,600 --> 01:02:40,920
Dad if you could hear this I
just want you to know that I

847
01:02:40,921 --> 01:02:43,193
never thought you
were a bad father.

848
01:02:45,993 --> 01:02:50,300
And I wish we could make
up for lost time...

849
01:02:52,100 --> 01:02:54,503
But I guess this is what we got.

850
01:02:58,805 --> 01:03:00,443
I love you pops!

851
01:03:02,243 --> 01:03:04,617
Not a day goes by that
I feel differently.

852
01:03:09,417 --> 01:03:11,519
Do you hear them Colonel?

853
01:03:12,319 --> 01:03:14,554
I don't know what to say...

854
01:03:14,555 --> 01:03:16,956
My name is Shirley Jones...

855
01:03:16,957 --> 01:03:20,929
And I'm 67 years old.

856
01:03:21,729 --> 01:03:29,335
I's like to believe that my husband George
can hear this but he can't... he's gone.

857
01:03:29,336 --> 01:03:33,541
I see you when I close my eyes.

858
01:03:33,542 --> 01:03:38,579
And you are so beautiful.

859
01:03:40,948 --> 01:03:43,851
I'll be with you soon.

860
01:03:54,394 --> 01:03:56,396
We can save them.

861
01:03:56,397 --> 01:04:00,402
You can save them.

862
01:04:01,202 --> 01:04:03,871
Please...

863
01:04:04,671 --> 01:04:07,440
Please...

864
01:04:07,441 --> 01:04:13,916
If anyone can hear
this please help us!

865
01:04:15,716 --> 01:04:19,155
I have my child...

866
01:04:19,955 --> 01:04:22,458
a little boy.

867
01:04:23,258 --> 01:04:26,460
I have my little boy.

868
01:04:26,461 --> 01:04:28,463
Please...

869
01:04:29,263 --> 01:04:33,266
He's only 8 years old
for Christ Sake!

870
01:04:33,267 --> 01:04:34,570
Please!

871
01:04:36,370 --> 01:04:41,577
Please if anyone can hear
this, please help us...

872
01:04:42,377 --> 01:04:44,748
Help us.

873
01:04:47,548 --> 01:04:49,119
We can't just let them die.

874
01:04:51,919 --> 01:04:54,224
I don't think you can either.

875
01:04:56,024 --> 01:04:58,661
Help me!

876
01:05:00,461 --> 01:05:02,699
Help them.

877
01:05:04,499 --> 01:05:05,802
Men...

878
01:05:07,602 --> 01:05:09,103
We have a duty.

879
01:05:09,903 --> 01:05:12,538
And that is to protect our people.

880
01:05:12,539 --> 01:05:14,112
No matter how dangerous.

881
01:05:17,912 --> 01:05:20,014
Sergeant Graham?

882
01:05:20,814 --> 01:05:22,215
Ready the jets.

883
01:05:22,216 --> 01:05:23,885
Yes Sir!

884
01:05:24,292 --> 01:05:26,526
Sir, by doing this you will
be disobeying state orders.

885
01:05:26,527 --> 01:05:29,924
Besides, what you are
talking about is suicide.

886
01:05:29,925 --> 01:05:31,724
Are these people
really worth the risk?

887
01:05:31,725 --> 01:05:34,762
We're not only saving them...

888
01:05:35,562 --> 01:05:37,036
We're saving all of us.

889
01:05:41,836 --> 01:05:43,038
And you...

890
01:05:43,838 --> 01:05:45,675
Back to your post, Specialist.

891
01:05:47,475 --> 01:05:49,882
Yes Sir!

892
01:06:00,521 --> 01:06:02,422
This bitch is heating up.

893
01:06:02,423 --> 01:06:05,195
Giving us a hell of a
lot of turbulence.

894
01:06:06,995 --> 01:06:10,697
They're scared. And so am I.

895
01:06:10,698 --> 01:06:12,632
Don't be.

896
01:06:12,633 --> 01:06:14,606
Sit.

897
01:06:18,406 --> 01:06:21,242
Listen...

898
01:06:22,042 --> 01:06:26,079
You're going to make
it to you families.

899
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:30,996
We're all gonna make
it through this.

900
01:06:42,796 --> 01:06:49,373
The only thing I love in this world
is a picture of my wife and kids.

901
01:06:52,173 --> 01:06:55,942
After I was told they
were taken from me...

902
01:06:55,943 --> 01:06:58,213
I kept flying.

903
01:06:59,013 --> 01:07:04,583
S-Somehow I could turn back time
and they'd be waiting for me...

904
01:07:04,584 --> 01:07:06,356
when I landed...

905
01:07:08,156 --> 01:07:12,726
I'm gonna keep on flying.

906
01:07:12,727 --> 01:07:17,498
Not for my family... but for us.

907
01:07:17,499 --> 01:07:19,900
For all of us.

908
01:07:20,700 --> 01:07:24,371
This is not the time to say your
goodbyes or your prayers...

909
01:07:24,372 --> 01:07:28,474
This is the time to
gather your courage!

910
01:07:28,475 --> 01:07:32,016
We're gonna face thing head on!

911
01:07:34,816 --> 01:07:36,585
I can still fly.

912
01:07:38,385 --> 01:07:39,556
I can still fly.

913
01:07:42,356 --> 01:07:48,430
The only way we beat them is if we relieve
pressure from their magma chamber here.

914
01:07:49,530 --> 01:07:52,433
This is where we focus our attack.

915
01:07:52,434 --> 01:07:55,168
Easier said than done, Doctor.
We won't stand a chance.

916
01:07:55,169 --> 01:08:01,373
Several direct hits to their core will
rupture enough passages to release the magma

917
01:08:01,374 --> 01:08:05,314
From its base in to the
ocean, killing the eruptions.

918
01:08:05,814 --> 01:08:08,650
We just might have
a chance. Questions?

919
01:08:09,450 --> 01:08:10,585
Good Luck.

920
01:08:11,385 --> 01:08:13,186
You don't have to do this Sir.

921
01:08:13,187 --> 01:08:14,920
We have plenty of our guys
suited up and ready to go.

922
01:08:14,921 --> 01:08:19,326
Soldier, these are my men and
I'll lead them how I see fit.

923
01:08:19,327 --> 01:08:20,226
Yes Sir!

924
01:08:20,227 --> 01:08:21,738
Now get your ass back to BDOC.

925
01:08:30,538 --> 01:08:31,604
Sir...

926
01:08:31,605 --> 01:08:33,105
I got us a rescue team.

927
01:08:33,106 --> 01:08:35,442
The plane is a little bulky

928
01:08:35,443 --> 01:08:38,997
But it flies on props so they won't have any
problems flying through the ash in the air.

929
01:08:38,998 --> 01:08:39,145
It's perfect.

930
01:08:39,146 --> 01:08:41,280
Yes they are.

931
01:08:41,281 --> 01:08:45,085
They practically jumped at the opportunity.
But they are a little extreme though.

932
01:08:45,086 --> 01:08:47,052
We're did you get these guys?

933
01:08:47,053 --> 01:08:49,256
Few of our boys, a couple
I know personally,

934
01:08:49,257 --> 01:08:53,028
They have a knack for extreme skydiving, so
they just called in a favor for the prop.

935
01:08:53,828 --> 01:08:55,528
Excellent Private. Excellent!

936
01:08:55,529 --> 01:08:56,629
Thank you Sir!

937
01:09:11,212 --> 01:09:13,752
This is red wing leader.
2 minutes out.

938
01:09:18,552 --> 01:09:19,791
Roger that.

939
01:09:23,591 --> 01:09:24,757
Okie dokie.

940
01:09:24,758 --> 01:09:27,527
I found this parachute
and this raft.

941
01:09:27,528 --> 01:09:29,363
We're gonna take this parachute...

942
01:09:30,163 --> 01:09:35,536
connect it to the raft and then we're
all gonna ride down to the ocean.

943
01:09:35,537 --> 01:09:37,938
And then we're gonna paddle
like hell to safety.

944
01:09:41,542 --> 01:09:44,478
Not everybody can fit
on that raft Jim.

945
01:09:44,479 --> 01:09:46,279
We're gonna get women
and kid off first.

946
01:10:02,696 --> 01:10:04,965
OK.

947
01:10:04,966 --> 01:10:09,970
I want all the women, and little Tony follow
me to the cargo. We're getting off this bird!

948
01:10:11,271 --> 01:10:13,039
You sure this is gonna work?

949
01:10:13,040 --> 01:10:14,507
I'll let you know.

950
01:10:14,508 --> 01:10:17,011
I don't think so.

951
01:10:17,811 --> 01:10:22,016
If anybody is getting
off this plane... it's me!

952
01:10:25,151 --> 01:10:27,753
Crieger! Crieger! Stop it!

953
01:10:27,754 --> 01:10:28,855
Stop!

954
01:10:30,992 --> 01:10:32,326
Everybody get down!

955
01:11:08,096 --> 01:11:10,202
One more step...

956
01:11:22,543 --> 01:11:25,247
You never could see
things my way right?

957
01:12:33,047 --> 01:12:35,018
Tony Macaroni.

958
01:12:37,818 --> 01:12:40,686
You're still taking care of mommy?

959
01:12:40,687 --> 01:12:43,362
We don't want anything
to happen to her, right?

960
01:12:48,162 --> 01:12:52,380
I...I have a grandson...

961
01:12:54,006 --> 01:12:56,237
about the same age as you.

962
01:12:57,738 --> 01:13:03,408
He always holds my hand...
even when I go to sleep.

963
01:13:03,409 --> 01:13:08,622
I don't know why,
but he always does.

964
01:13:16,022 --> 01:13:18,737
Boo-ya.

965
01:13:30,537 --> 01:13:36,180
I... I'm going to rest for...
for a little while, OK?

966
01:13:53,159 --> 01:13:54,666
Holy mother of...

967
01:13:58,466 --> 01:13:59,566
They're huge!

968
01:14:00,460 --> 01:14:02,374
This is red wing leader.
All fighters check in.

969
01:14:02,375 --> 01:14:03,603
Red Wing 1, standing by.

970
01:14:03,604 --> 01:14:05,337
Red Wing 3, standing by.

971
01:14:05,338 --> 01:14:07,542
Red Wing 5, standing by.

972
01:14:09,376 --> 01:14:11,345
OK. Gotta get in gotta move fast!

973
01:14:11,346 --> 01:14:13,282
It's your party Red wing leader.

974
01:14:15,082 --> 01:14:18,122
Roger that. Men... lock on their cores.
Red Wings, going in hot!

975
01:14:28,595 --> 01:14:30,363
Crieger's taken the raft.

976
01:14:30,364 --> 01:14:31,967
Let him.

977
01:14:45,413 --> 01:14:46,849
Look!

978
01:14:48,649 --> 01:14:49,749
Yes!

979
01:14:56,257 --> 01:14:58,725
Ladies and Gentlemen
help has arrived!

980
01:14:58,726 --> 01:15:01,046
Everybody hand on! This is
going to get really bumpy.

981
01:15:01,829 --> 01:15:03,564
Strap in.

982
01:15:04,364 --> 01:15:05,601
You good?

983
01:15:08,401 --> 01:15:09,501
Bring it on.

984
01:15:10,270 --> 01:15:12,976
Red Wings, engage!

985
01:15:15,776 --> 01:15:17,475
They're everywhere.

986
01:15:17,476 --> 01:15:18,949
I'm going in.

987
01:15:22,749 --> 01:15:24,420
Come on! Open wide!

988
01:15:26,220 --> 01:15:28,787
Dammit Red Wings,
lay down the fire!

989
01:15:28,788 --> 01:15:31,792
Roger that! Red Wing 3, box 1!

990
01:15:31,793 --> 01:15:34,664
Red Wing 5, box 2!

991
01:15:37,464 --> 01:15:38,565
Dammit!

992
01:15:39,365 --> 01:15:40,805
I can't get a clear shot at it.

993
01:15:45,338 --> 01:15:47,439
The target is set!

994
01:15:47,440 --> 01:15:49,043
I can't see 'em.

995
01:15:54,280 --> 01:15:55,881
We're losing men left and right.

996
01:15:55,882 --> 01:15:58,154
Wider missiles. Wider Missiles.

997
01:16:00,954 --> 01:16:03,457
Red Wing leader, lady down
cover fire for that plane.

998
01:16:03,458 --> 01:16:05,757
I'm sending evac with
a few firecrackers.

999
01:16:05,758 --> 01:16:09,272
Get on the comm and tell those guys to ready
explosives to be stuffed in to that plane.

1000
01:16:09,273 --> 01:16:10,764
What are you nuts?

1001
01:16:10,765 --> 01:16:12,800
Yeah.

1002
01:16:13,600 --> 01:16:15,467
Alright, I'm on it.

1003
01:16:15,468 --> 01:16:17,537
You head him, let's plow the road!

1004
01:16:31,552 --> 01:16:35,153
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow!
This is base, come in?

1005
01:16:35,154 --> 01:16:36,489
Read you, Base.

1006
01:16:36,490 --> 01:16:38,123
Do you have any
explosives on board?

1007
01:16:38,124 --> 01:16:40,318
That's an affirmative! Never
leave home with out them.

1008
01:16:40,319 --> 01:16:43,597
Good! I think they
may come in handy.

1009
01:16:44,397 --> 01:16:46,132
This is gonna be close!

1010
01:16:46,133 --> 01:16:47,568
Look out!

1011
01:16:55,476 --> 01:16:59,884
I'm hit! I'm hit! Red
Wing 3, ejecting!

1012
01:17:03,684 --> 01:17:06,586
I'm hit! I'm going down!
I'm going down!

1013
01:17:06,587 --> 01:17:09,122
Eject, dammit, eject!

1014
01:17:11,123 --> 01:17:12,558
Oh I miss Los Angeles.

1015
01:17:12,559 --> 01:17:14,159
We're that damn Evac?

1016
01:17:14,160 --> 01:17:16,362
There're getting killed out there!

1017
01:17:16,363 --> 01:17:19,077
Fly & Tow, Fly & Tow! Get your asses
in there now! What's your eta?

1018
01:17:19,078 --> 01:17:22,402
ETA is 1 minute, Control,
ready and packing!

1019
01:17:22,403 --> 01:17:23,503
Roger that!

1020
01:17:23,837 --> 01:17:25,917
Red Wing Leader, you have
less than one minute!

1021
01:17:33,381 --> 01:17:35,631
Times up.

1022
01:18:18,492 --> 01:18:20,426
Oh... my...

1023
01:18:20,427 --> 01:18:22,542
You are a big bitch.

1024
01:19:09,109 --> 01:19:10,929
Yudo time to fly!

1025
01:19:28,729 --> 01:19:31,296
Help is here! But
what are they doing?

1026
01:19:31,297 --> 01:19:33,667
They're towing you out of there!

1027
01:19:33,668 --> 01:19:34,734
What?

1028
01:19:34,735 --> 01:19:36,538
Is that safe?

1029
01:19:38,338 --> 01:19:41,011
We have the package! Towing now!

1030
01:19:50,016 --> 01:19:52,787
There's too much wind
resistance on that plane.

1031
01:19:53,587 --> 01:19:54,908
We're gonna have to drop it.

1032
01:19:55,021 --> 01:19:56,256
Hurry you asses up!

1033
01:19:57,056 --> 01:19:58,692
Yes Sir!

1034
01:19:59,492 --> 01:20:00,592
We're going in again!

1035
01:20:00,961 --> 01:20:03,462
Get every soul of that plane!

1036
01:20:09,102 --> 01:20:12,305
Hey! Hey! take my son!

1037
01:20:12,306 --> 01:20:13,916
Go go go!

1038
01:20:21,716 --> 01:20:24,993
Receiving our 1st 2 passengers.

1039
01:20:41,935 --> 01:20:43,475
Go! Go! Go! Get them out now!

1040
01:20:49,275 --> 01:20:52,422
Control! We can't stay
here much longer!

1041
01:21:02,222 --> 01:21:03,322
Go go go!

1042
01:21:04,056 --> 01:21:06,458
Get back on board now!

1043
01:21:06,459 --> 01:21:07,595
What's in the bag?

1044
01:21:09,395 --> 01:21:12,631
Enough explosives to blow this
bastard back to where it came from!

1045
01:21:12,632 --> 01:21:14,100
Are you guys crazy?

1046
01:21:14,101 --> 01:21:16,902
- We've been told!
- That's everybody come on!

1047
01:21:16,903 --> 01:21:20,640
No we're not leaving
without Rick. Rick!

1048
01:21:20,641 --> 01:21:22,176
We have to go ma'am.

1049
01:21:22,976 --> 01:21:25,078
I'll be right back!

1050
01:21:25,079 --> 01:21:26,847
Rita!

1051
01:21:28,647 --> 01:21:31,756
Rick, we need to go...

1052
01:21:35,556 --> 01:21:36,656
It's not that bad.

1053
01:21:40,260 --> 01:21:43,095
We need to go. They're
getting us out of here.

1054
01:21:43,096 --> 01:21:45,764
Come on, you two,
we need to go now!

1055
01:21:45,765 --> 01:21:47,034
We're taking him with us!

1056
01:21:48,834 --> 01:21:50,240
We're taking him with us!

1057
01:21:54,040 --> 01:21:59,545
You don't have to.
You don't have to. It's OK.

1058
01:21:59,546 --> 01:22:00,646
It's OK.

1059
01:22:24,570 --> 01:22:25,670
Go.

1060
01:22:26,172 --> 01:22:27,875
You've got a plane to catch.

1061
01:22:28,675 --> 01:22:30,877
I'm sorry.

1062
01:22:30,878 --> 01:22:32,412
- I'm sorry
- It's OK.

1063
01:22:32,413 --> 01:22:37,685
I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry. I'm Sorry.

1064
01:22:39,485 --> 01:22:42,186
We've loaded the plane with
200 pounds of explosives.

1065
01:22:42,187 --> 01:22:45,190
You have to hit the
center of the volcano.

1066
01:22:45,191 --> 01:22:46,257
OK.

1067
01:22:46,258 --> 01:22:47,628
Good Luck.

1068
01:22:55,502 --> 01:22:57,269
I'm a pilot.

1069
01:22:57,270 --> 01:22:58,370
I can fly.

1070
01:23:01,039 --> 01:23:02,239
It's time to go! Come on!

1071
01:23:02,842 --> 01:23:04,011
It's time to go!

1072
01:23:04,811 --> 01:23:07,948
Where's Rick?

1073
01:23:08,748 --> 01:23:10,150
Get him out of here! Ready?

1074
01:23:10,950 --> 01:23:12,688
Yeah yeah yeah.

1075
01:23:15,488 --> 01:23:16,899
The plane is cleared.

1076
01:23:25,699 --> 01:23:27,637
I'm not going anywhere.

1077
01:23:36,510 --> 01:23:37,576
Good Luck son.

1078
01:23:37,577 --> 01:23:39,118
Red Wings, pull out.

1079
01:23:44,918 --> 01:23:48,960
Control, I've got an incoming
bogey. He's not gonna make it.

1080
01:23:53,760 --> 01:23:55,832
I'm going in.

1081
01:24:13,547 --> 01:24:14,992
Come on!

1082
01:24:25,792 --> 01:24:31,233
Come on!!!

1083
01:24:51,418 --> 01:24:53,621
He did it!

1084
01:24:54,421 --> 01:24:55,355
He did it!

1085
01:24:55,356 --> 01:24:56,523
Yes!

1086
01:25:00,860 --> 01:25:02,096
- Blow it up!
- No blow it up.

1087
01:25:02,122 --> 01:25:03,645
That's enough explosions for today.

1088
01:25:03,829 --> 01:25:05,900
I'm sorry I'm excited.

1089
01:25:10,803 --> 01:25:12,908
Sergeant congratulations!

1090
01:25:15,708 --> 01:25:17,943
Yeah. We did it!

1091
01:25:17,944 --> 01:25:19,347
We did it.

1092
01:25:21,147 --> 01:25:23,481
Hawaii wasn't alone
experiencing volcanic activity.

1093
01:25:23,482 --> 01:25:26,076
Mt. Vesuvius has reportedly erupted
wiping out Pompeii for good.

1094
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:26,987
Tully.

1095
01:25:27,787 --> 01:25:29,689
Hell of a job soldier.

1096
01:25:29,690 --> 01:25:31,590
Hell of a job.

1097
01:25:31,591 --> 01:25:33,828
Colonel Rhyker would be proud.

1098
01:25:34,628 --> 01:25:36,695
Thank you sir.

1099
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:37,796
No.

1100
01:25:38,431 --> 01:25:41,773
Thank you... Sergeant.

1101
01:25:46,573 --> 01:25:47,673
Carry on sergeant.

1102
01:25:47,841 --> 01:25:49,746
Yes, sir.

1103
01:26:23,309 --> 01:26:25,216
I'll never forget him.

1104
01:26:30,016 --> 01:26:32,000
Neither will I.
