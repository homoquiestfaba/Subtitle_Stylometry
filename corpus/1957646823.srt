00:24:32,939 --> 00:24:34,841
* you can't fool me

373
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:39,679
* I see it
in your eyes... *

374
00:24:41,914 --> 00:24:43,015
hi.

375
00:24:43,049 --> 00:24:45,184
I knew it.

376
00:24:45,217 --> 00:24:47,720
Let me
introduce myself.

377
00:24:47,754 --> 00:24:49,856
I'm the daughter
from hell.

378
00:24:49,889 --> 00:24:51,157
And you?

379
00:24:51,190 --> 00:24:53,092
I'm patsy.

380
00:24:56,162 --> 00:24:57,864
You're perfect.

381
00:24:57,897 --> 00:24:59,932
Why, thank you.

382
00:24:59,966 --> 00:25:00,867
You're welcome.

383
00:25:00,900 --> 00:25:05,171
Would you like to come in
for a Dr. Pepper?

384
00:25:25,157 --> 00:25:26,058
"Jen,

385
00:25:26,092 --> 00:25:29,128
"1 year out of 23
ain't so bad.

386
00:25:29,161 --> 00:25:30,162
"Couldn't forget

387
00:25:30,196 --> 00:25:33,265
"all them great years
and great times,

388
00:25:33,299 --> 00:25:34,601
"so I came back.

389
00:25:34,634 --> 00:25:36,803
"I know you
deserve better.

390
00:25:36,836 --> 00:25:38,204
"Let me talk to you.

391
00:25:38,237 --> 00:25:41,641
"Let me take care
of the mortgage finally.

392
00:25:41,674 --> 00:25:44,744
Meet me
at the longhorn."

393
00:25:44,777 --> 00:25:46,713
Henry.

394
00:25:54,053 --> 00:25:57,556
You're the oldest
daughter, aren't you?

395
00:25:58,958 --> 00:26:01,260
Henry don't say
much about you.

396
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:04,230
He talks about
the other one.

397
00:26:06,398 --> 00:26:07,834
Kat.

398
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:11,638
Does he ever
mention my mama?

399
00:26:11,671 --> 00:26:12,705
No.

400
00:26:12,739 --> 00:26:14,707
You know, I've
been thinking

401
00:26:14,741 --> 00:26:17,009
of trying my hair
like that.

402
00:26:17,043 --> 00:26:19,646
I think I'm probably
a little too old

403
00:26:19,679 --> 00:26:21,047
for that style.

404
00:26:21,080 --> 00:26:23,049
You wouldn't
happen to know

405
00:26:23,082 --> 00:26:24,884
what my father's
been doing

406
00:26:24,917 --> 00:26:27,219
for the past year,
would you?

407
00:26:27,253 --> 00:26:29,922
Selling Cadillacs.

408
00:26:29,956 --> 00:26:30,923
Right.

409
00:26:30,957 --> 00:26:32,659
Sold a lot of them.

410
00:26:32,692 --> 00:26:36,062
Had his own dealership
in Dallas.

411
00:26:36,095 --> 00:26:38,230
Had?

412
00:26:38,264 --> 00:26:41,167
Well, he kind of...
Overextended himself.

413
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:43,335
Took a bit of a bath,

414
00:26:43,369 --> 00:26:46,272
but we're going
right back into it.

415
00:26:46,305 --> 00:26:49,108
Looks like
we got US a Japanese

416
00:26:49,141 --> 00:26:52,812
to put up the money
for another dealership.

417
00:26:52,845 --> 00:26:53,880
Cadillacs.

418
00:26:53,913 --> 00:26:56,282
Nah. Mercedes.

419
00:26:56,315 --> 00:26:57,049
Oh.

420
00:26:57,083 --> 00:26:59,819
He's the best salesman
I ever seen.

421
00:26:59,852 --> 00:27:01,721
I bet.

422
00:27:17,069 --> 00:27:18,237
Jen,

423
00:27:18,270 --> 00:27:20,907
I'm glad
you could come.

424
00:27:20,940 --> 00:27:23,375
Whoop-de-do.

425
00:27:32,819 --> 00:27:35,988
So, what'll it be,

426
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,757
beer?

427
00:27:37,790 --> 00:27:40,827
Don't you want to know
where I've been?

428
00:27:40,860 --> 00:27:45,031
What did you do,
Rob a bank, Henry?

429
00:27:45,064 --> 00:27:46,833
What?

430
00:27:46,866 --> 00:27:47,599
The clothes,

431
00:27:47,633 --> 00:27:50,136
the snakeskin boots,
the Cadillac.

432
00:27:50,169 --> 00:27:52,138
We'll get to that.

433
00:27:52,171 --> 00:27:54,240
Now, uh...

434
00:27:54,273 --> 00:27:56,743
How you been doing?

435
00:27:59,511 --> 00:28:02,148
What the hell
am I doing here?

436
00:28:02,181 --> 00:28:04,917
All right.
I got the money.

437
00:28:04,951 --> 00:28:06,018
Sit down.

438
00:28:06,052 --> 00:28:07,820
Come on.

439
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:15,227
Jenny.

440
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:16,462
Tom.

441
00:28:16,495 --> 00:28:17,864
How was
the wedding?

442
00:28:17,897 --> 00:28:20,933
It was interesting.

443
00:28:20,967 --> 00:28:22,168
Tom, Henry.

444
00:28:22,201 --> 00:28:25,371
Henry,
how are you?

445
00:28:26,172 --> 00:28:28,741
I'm...good.

446
00:28:29,842 --> 00:28:33,179
Won't you
join US, Tom?

447
00:28:36,482 --> 00:28:38,017
You, uh...

448
00:28:38,050 --> 00:28:40,853
New around here?

449
00:28:41,387 --> 00:28:42,454
Yeah.

450
00:28:42,488 --> 00:28:44,223
Oh, yeah?

451
00:28:44,256 --> 00:28:45,992
Where you from?

452
00:28:46,025 --> 00:28:47,126
Montana.

453
00:28:47,159 --> 00:28:49,061
How about you?

454
00:28:49,095 --> 00:28:51,798
I lived here
for some time.

455
00:28:51,831 --> 00:28:55,501
Henry's my husband, Tom.

456
00:28:55,534 --> 00:28:56,903
Husband?

457
00:28:56,936 --> 00:28:58,737
You back?

458
00:29:00,106 --> 00:29:02,008
Yeah.

459
00:29:05,211 --> 00:29:07,513
Daughter come
from New York?

460
00:29:07,546 --> 00:29:08,514
Mm-hmm.

461
00:29:08,547 --> 00:29:11,217
Samantha's here?

462
00:29:12,018 --> 00:29:14,186
You didn't notice?

463
00:29:14,921 --> 00:29:17,256
I spent some time
in New York.

464
00:29:17,289 --> 00:29:20,259
You ever been
to New York, Henry?

465
00:29:20,292 --> 00:29:21,293
Nope.

466
00:29:21,327 --> 00:29:23,796
Strange place.

467
00:29:23,830 --> 00:29:24,997
People
don't talk there.

468
00:29:25,031 --> 00:29:29,335
They bark
at each other
like dogs.

469
00:29:30,302 --> 00:29:35,141
I kept thinking
a fight would start.

470
00:29:37,910 --> 00:29:40,079
So...

471
00:29:41,313 --> 00:29:42,982
What do you do?

472
00:29:43,015 --> 00:29:45,184
I'm a stockbroker,

473
00:29:45,217 --> 00:29:46,819
although you
probably think

474
00:29:46,853 --> 00:29:48,988
I'm some sort
of a shit.

475
00:29:49,021 --> 00:29:51,023
Well, I don't know.

476
00:29:51,057 --> 00:29:55,127
Look, I don't know
why your daddy
left your mama.

477
00:29:55,161 --> 00:29:57,329
That's between them.

478
00:29:58,164 --> 00:29:59,465
All I know

479
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:04,003
is that he told me
he was divorced.

480
00:30:06,072 --> 00:30:09,008
Are they divorced?

481
00:30:15,915 --> 00:30:19,886
Well, thanks
for the beer.

482
00:30:19,919 --> 00:30:22,121
You look nice...

483
00:30:22,154 --> 00:30:24,223
Jenny.

484
00:30:26,358 --> 00:30:28,094
Henry.

485
00:30:39,005 --> 00:30:40,272
Who was that?

486
00:30:40,306 --> 00:30:42,241
Where's my money,
Henry?

487
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:45,544
I told you
I'd get it for you,

488
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,179
and I will.

489
00:30:47,213 --> 00:30:48,414
All of it?

490
00:30:48,447 --> 00:30:50,950
All nine months
of it?

491
00:30:58,624 --> 00:31:01,127
You're not leaving?

492
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:02,628
I think so.

493
00:31:02,661 --> 00:31:04,396
Jen.

494
00:31:08,534 --> 00:31:10,169
Jen.

495
00:31:11,403 --> 00:31:13,172
Howdy, darling.

496
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:16,642
Let go of me!

497
00:31:16,675 --> 00:31:20,112
Let me buy you
a drink.

498
00:31:20,146 --> 00:31:21,080
What do you want?

499
00:31:21,113 --> 00:31:25,451
I don't think
the lady wants
to dance, amigo.

500
00:31:29,488 --> 00:31:30,389
Listen, Jen,

501
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:33,392
I can shoot
by the hotel

502
00:31:33,425 --> 00:31:36,628
and get
the checkbook.

503
00:31:39,131 --> 00:31:40,032
Come on.

504
00:31:40,066 --> 00:31:42,634
Let me
take you home.

505
00:31:42,668 --> 00:31:44,436
Please.

506
00:32:03,722 --> 00:32:05,357
Look.

507
00:32:06,425 --> 00:32:08,460
I know
he's been seeing you

508
00:32:08,494 --> 00:32:10,329
for at least two years.

509
00:32:10,362 --> 00:32:14,233
And you didn't
tell your mama?

510
00:32:16,768 --> 00:32:18,370
No.

511
00:32:19,338 --> 00:32:22,941
It would have
broken her heart.

512
00:32:24,576 --> 00:32:26,712
Pretty stupid, huh?

513
00:32:26,745 --> 00:32:28,580
Want to welcome
all you folks

514
00:32:28,614 --> 00:32:33,319
to the Saturday buffet dance
at the longhorn.

515
00:32:38,424 --> 00:32:42,461
* your eyes
shine like diamonds *

516
00:32:42,494 --> 00:32:46,465
* your lips
like cherry wine *

517
00:32:46,498 --> 00:32:50,036
* figure's like
an hourglass *

518
00:32:50,069 --> 00:32:51,170
* honey, I could...

519
00:32:51,203 --> 00:32:54,240
Well, look who
the cat dragged in.

520
00:32:54,273 --> 00:32:55,474
How you been?

521
00:32:55,507 --> 00:32:57,076
Good. Like a beer?

522
00:32:57,109 --> 00:32:58,077
Please.

523
00:32:58,110 --> 00:32:58,777
Sure.

524
00:32:58,810 --> 00:33:01,013
You, uh,
seen my daddy around?

525
00:33:01,047 --> 00:33:04,383
Uh, he left
with your mama.

526
00:33:09,055 --> 00:33:12,524
* well, do you
come here often? *

527
00:33:12,558 --> 00:33:16,395
* honey, what's your sign?

528
00:33:16,428 --> 00:33:19,731
* feel like I've known you

529
00:33:19,765 --> 00:33:23,235
* in another place
and time *

530
00:33:23,269 --> 00:33:24,002
yee-haw!

531
00:33:24,036 --> 00:33:27,639
* it was written
in the stars *

532
00:33:27,673 --> 00:33:30,476
* we should meet once more

533
00:33:30,509 --> 00:33:37,383
* but stop me if you've
heard this one before *

534
00:33:38,484 --> 00:33:43,255
* it's gettin' close
to closin' time *

535
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:51,430
Henry.

536
00:33:52,831 --> 00:33:54,200
Smell that,

537
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:55,234
manure...

538
00:33:55,267 --> 00:33:56,202
Sage...

539
00:33:56,235 --> 00:33:58,337
Mesquite?

540
00:33:58,370 --> 00:33:59,138
New Mexico--

541
00:33:59,171 --> 00:34:01,407
ain't no smell
like it.

542
00:34:01,440 --> 00:34:03,175
Henry.

543
00:34:04,610 --> 00:34:06,612
What are we doing here?

544
00:34:06,645 --> 00:34:07,813
We'll go to the hotel,

545
00:34:07,846 --> 00:34:10,249
but first I want
to talk to you.

546
00:34:10,282 --> 00:34:13,752
There's some things I
want to explain to you.

547
00:34:13,785 --> 00:34:16,054
Hear me out.

548
00:34:16,322 --> 00:34:20,292
There was a reason
I left you.

549
00:34:20,326 --> 00:34:21,227
Oh?

550
00:34:21,260 --> 00:34:23,695
What was that, Henry?

551
00:34:23,729 --> 00:34:26,832
Sometimes it just stops.

552
00:34:26,865 --> 00:34:28,600
For you.

553
00:34:28,634 --> 00:34:31,570
And for you.

554
00:34:33,372 --> 00:34:35,374
No, it didn't.

555
00:34:35,407 --> 00:34:38,444
You know what
your problem is, Henry?

556
00:34:38,477 --> 00:34:41,213
You're terrified
of growing old.

557
00:34:41,247 --> 00:34:43,682
You took one look at me,

558
00:34:43,715 --> 00:34:46,352
lines under my eyes,

559
00:34:46,385 --> 00:34:48,354
crow's feet...

560
00:34:48,387 --> 00:34:50,322
Frown marks...

561
00:34:50,356 --> 00:34:52,124
Varicose veins.

562
00:34:52,158 --> 00:34:54,860
You started
getting nervous.

563
00:35:00,166 --> 00:35:03,335
My god, I am
a little afraid

564
00:35:03,369 --> 00:35:05,237
of growing old.

565
00:35:05,271 --> 00:35:07,539
What's wrong with that?

566
00:35:11,910 --> 00:35:13,479
Nothing. So am I.

567
00:35:13,512 --> 00:35:16,248
I just thought
there was a chance

568
00:35:16,282 --> 00:35:18,850
we could do it together.

569
00:35:19,318 --> 00:35:21,687
Oh, Jen,
is there any reason

570
00:35:21,720 --> 00:35:24,890
why we can't
just be friends?

571
00:35:24,923 --> 00:35:26,258
Don't want to be friends.

572
00:35:26,292 --> 00:35:30,829
Is that why you came back,
to be friends?

573
00:35:30,862 --> 00:35:33,832
I did want to
square things with you.

574
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:37,503
I thought we could
do it like friends.

575
00:35:37,536 --> 00:35:39,671
Divorce?

576
00:35:46,778 --> 00:35:50,249
Why didn't you
just say so before?

577
00:35:50,282 --> 00:35:51,183
Say what?

578
00:35:51,217 --> 00:35:54,520
Divorce. That you
wanted a god damn divorce.

579
00:35:54,553 --> 00:35:56,588
This ain't easy
for me, Jen.

580
00:35:56,622 --> 00:36:00,359
Oh, I feel real sorry
for you, Henry.

581
00:36:00,392 --> 00:36:03,229
Jen, come on now!

582
00:36:03,895 --> 00:36:06,232
Who is she?

583
00:36:06,598 --> 00:36:09,568
She? Well...

584
00:36:09,968 --> 00:36:13,171
Somebody
I met in Dallas.

585
00:36:13,972 --> 00:36:16,908
Where is she now?

586
00:36:16,942 --> 00:36:18,577
Now?

587
00:36:19,578 --> 00:36:21,947

588
00:36:23,282 --> 00:36:24,883
How old is she,
Henry, 15?

589
00:36:24,916 --> 00:36:30,222
Or maybe
you got a 29-year-old
version of me.

590
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:35,261
You bastard.

591
00:36:35,761 --> 00:36:37,896
She got money, too--

592
00:36:37,929 --> 00:36:38,530

593
00:36:38,564 --> 00:36:41,600

show you something.

595
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:58,517
It's yours--my prize.

596
00:36:58,550 --> 00:36:59,551
Prize?

597
00:36:59,585 --> 00:37:00,619
Yep.

598
00:37:00,652 --> 00:37:03,722
Well, what for, for getting
the richest girlfriend?

599
00:37:03,755 --> 00:37:05,457
No. Let me tell you now.

600
00:37:05,491 --> 00:37:08,994
This is for selling
100 Cadillacs last year.

601
00:37:09,027 --> 00:37:10,596
That's two a week.

602

Gm give it to me.

603
00:37:12,598 --> 00:37:13,432
It's nice, ain't it?

604
00:37:13,465 --> 00:37:16,435
That prize is worth
$8,000 in pure gold

605
00:37:16,468 --> 00:37:17,569
if you melt it down.

606
00:37:17,603 --> 00:37:21,473
You think you should
be carrying this around
in a car?

607
00:37:21,507 --> 00:37:25,444
That's the only award
I ever won in my life.

608
00:37:25,477 --> 00:37:28,747
Can I tell you something
I never told you?

609
00:37:28,780 --> 00:37:29,781
I don't know why not.

610
00:37:29,815 --> 00:37:35,654
23 years, you never did
tell me much of anything.

611
00:37:35,954 --> 00:37:38,790
I hated fixing cars.

612
00:37:38,824 --> 00:37:42,361
I hated that
god damn garage.

613
00:37:42,394 --> 00:37:44,029
All I ever
thought about

614
00:37:44,062 --> 00:37:46,698
was buying back
my daddy's brand.

615
00:37:46,732 --> 00:37:47,533
I've had dreams, too.

616
00:37:47,566 --> 00:37:50,469
Don't get me wrong.
Life's been good.

617
00:37:50,502 --> 00:37:53,739
I've had two
wonderful daughters.

618
00:37:54,340 --> 00:37:56,608
Kat's married
and happy now.

619

620
00:37:57,676 --> 00:38:01,813
Do you know
that your daughter
played town hall,

621
00:38:01,847 --> 00:38:03,048
and she's getting ready

622
00:38:03,081 --> 00:38:06,552
to do her first
big solo recital?

623
00:38:06,585 --> 00:38:08,086
Is that right?

624
00:38:08,119 --> 00:38:10,522
She's pissed at you,
Henry.

625
00:38:10,556 --> 00:38:11,823
She's very pissed.

626
00:38:11,857 --> 00:38:14,560
You better talk to her.

627
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:22,300
Yeah, I'll do that.
Yeah. I got to do that.

Dance with me.

you're still the best
dancer I know, Jen.

You're still the best
bullshitter I know.

653
00:40:10,175 --> 00:40:11,843
Ha ha ha!

654
00:40:11,877 --> 00:40:14,145
Is that why
we got married?

655
00:40:14,179 --> 00:40:17,683
Is that why
we're getting divorced?

656
00:40:17,716 --> 00:40:19,017
Wait a minute, now.

657
00:40:19,050 --> 00:40:21,687
I thought you understood.

658
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:24,590
I just can't
move back here.

659
00:40:24,623 --> 00:40:27,058
It wasn't working out.

660
00:40:28,527 --> 00:40:30,529
Did you ever
stop and think

661
00:40:30,562 --> 00:40:34,199
that maybe
I might be
attracted to a man?

662
00:40:34,232 --> 00:40:36,835
What are you saying?

663
00:40:36,868 --> 00:40:38,136
I had something,
Henry.

664
00:40:38,169 --> 00:40:40,972
Oh, did I ever
have something,

665
00:40:41,006 --> 00:40:42,240
three years ago.

666
00:40:42,273 --> 00:40:44,643
He was
a young cowboy.

667
00:40:44,676 --> 00:40:46,111
Heh heh heh.

668
00:40:46,144 --> 00:40:47,913
Young?

669
00:40:49,114 --> 00:40:50,749
19. How's that?

670
00:40:50,782 --> 00:40:54,185
That was when you
weren't around much,

671
00:40:54,219 --> 00:40:55,186
remember?

672
00:40:55,220 --> 00:40:58,056
And he, uh,
followed me in
the hardware store,

673
00:40:58,089 --> 00:41:00,859
and then
he followed me
in the supermarket.

674
00:41:00,892 --> 00:41:02,761
Good-looking,

and a cute ass.

677
00:41:07,198 --> 00:41:10,101
He drove up
to the house
one night,

678
00:41:10,135 --> 00:41:15,974
and he
just sat there
in his pickup truck.

679
00:41:16,742 --> 00:41:19,277
And I was lonely.

680
00:41:19,310 --> 00:41:22,013
What, uh...

681
00:41:22,781 --> 00:41:24,850
Was his name?

682
00:41:24,883 --> 00:41:26,117
Kyle.

the divorce papers?

with you?

Never seen you
so prepared, Henry.

689

for me, either.

Just give me
the god damn check

692
00:41:51,943 --> 00:41:54,079
and take me home.

693
00:44:58,830 --> 00:45:02,100
Can I ask you a question?

694
00:45:03,501 --> 00:45:04,335
Yeah.

what you're going
to do with it.

You son of a bitch.

705
00:46:20,545 --> 00:46:21,446
You came back here

706
00:46:21,479 --> 00:46:24,916
to just erase
the entire past,
didn't you?

707
00:46:24,950 --> 00:46:25,951
What do you mean?

708
00:46:25,984 --> 00:46:27,118
Don't bullshit me now,
Henry.

709
00:46:27,152 --> 00:46:31,589
I put a lot of my time,
sweat, and money
into that place.

710
00:46:31,622 --> 00:46:34,893

to me, too.

00:48:11,189 --> 00:48:14,159
No, it's not.

743
00:48:18,029 --> 00:48:19,364
I got to go.

744
00:48:19,397 --> 00:48:20,631
Wait, Sam. Sam.

745
00:48:20,665 --> 00:48:21,532
I'm going.

746
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:23,301
Sam, damn it. Sam.

747
00:48:23,334 --> 00:48:25,170
Sam.

748
00:48:28,306 --> 00:48:30,108
Damn it!

749
00:48:53,631 --> 00:48:56,234
You all right?

750
00:49:04,142 --> 00:49:06,611
Let me drive you home.

751
00:49:06,644 --> 00:49:11,116
No. Actually, Tom,
i'd--I'd rather walk.

752
00:49:11,349 --> 00:49:14,952
If you ever
need anything...

753
00:49:16,354 --> 00:49:18,256
You ask.

754
00:49:20,325 --> 00:49:22,360
I mean it.

755
00:49:47,185 --> 00:49:49,754
Go home, bill, please.

756
00:49:49,787 --> 00:49:51,322
Damn it!

757
00:49:51,356 --> 00:49:53,391
Look at me.

758
00:49:56,061 --> 00:49:59,530
You don't understand,
bill.

759
00:50:03,668 --> 00:50:06,437
I can't stay here.

760
00:50:07,538 --> 00:50:08,306
What's wrong with it?

761
00:50:08,339 --> 00:50:12,743
People get stuck
in places like this.

762
00:50:12,777 --> 00:50:14,812
Like me.

763
00:50:14,845 --> 00:50:16,381
I didn't say that.

764
00:50:16,414 --> 00:50:19,016
Like hell you didn't.

765
00:50:31,262 --> 00:50:34,399
I like it here, Sam.

766
00:50:37,368 --> 00:50:39,070
It's clean.

767
00:50:39,104 --> 00:50:41,272
People...are good.

768
00:50:41,306 --> 00:50:43,308
They're decent.

769
00:50:43,341 --> 00:50:44,442
Yeah, well...

770
00:50:44,475 --> 00:50:47,478
Maybe I'm an asshole
sometime,

771
00:50:47,512 --> 00:50:49,147
but you know what?

772
00:50:49,180 --> 00:50:50,281
That's just as bad

773
00:50:50,315 --> 00:50:53,284
as anybody ever gets
around here.

774
00:50:54,385 --> 00:50:58,456
I just have one question
for you, Sam.

775
00:51:08,299 --> 00:51:12,770
How could you leave me
without saying anything?

776
00:51:13,238 --> 00:51:16,307
You still love me,
don't you?

777
00:51:16,341 --> 00:51:20,345
For Christ sakes, Sam,
just say it.

778
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:24,382
Just say the word.

779
00:52:42,860 --> 00:52:47,198
I think you should know
I'm losing the house.

780
00:52:47,232 --> 00:52:50,301
The bank is taking it
on Monday,

781
00:52:50,335 --> 00:52:54,239
and I'll have
to move out.

782
00:53:04,949 --> 00:53:06,617
What happened?

783
00:53:06,651 --> 00:53:09,220
Your daddy and I
took out a loan

784
00:53:09,254 --> 00:53:11,356
against the house
for his garage,

785
00:53:11,389 --> 00:53:13,558
and when he left,

786
00:53:13,591 --> 00:53:17,262
I couldn't keep up
the payments.

787
00:53:34,845 --> 00:53:36,447
What are you doing?

788
00:53:36,481 --> 00:53:37,682
Writing you a check.

789
00:53:37,715 --> 00:53:38,849
What about school?

790
00:53:38,883 --> 00:53:40,585
I'll skip a year.

791
00:53:40,618 --> 00:53:41,552
Sam, no.

792
00:53:41,586 --> 00:53:44,722
It's my home, too, mama.

793
00:53:50,595 --> 00:53:52,430
Sam, honey...

794
00:53:52,463 --> 00:53:55,433
I can't take your money.

795
00:53:57,702 --> 00:53:59,570
Mama...

796
00:54:10,715 --> 00:54:13,318
Are you all right?

797
00:54:16,687 --> 00:54:18,556
I'm fine.

799
00:54:44,749 --> 00:54:48,653

Pull over!

00:54:59,397 --> 00:55:03,100
* just for the love
of someone... *

805

806
00:55:21,919 --> 00:55:24,389
Well. Ha ha ha!

807
00:55:24,422 --> 00:55:27,324
Well, well,
little girl.

808
00:55:27,625 --> 00:55:29,760
You've been avoiding me?

809
00:55:29,794 --> 00:55:30,695
Aw!

810
00:55:30,728 --> 00:55:32,029
Whoop-de-do!

811
00:55:32,062 --> 00:55:33,798
Don't I get a hug?

812
00:55:33,831 --> 00:55:37,001
I heard you were
a big success.

813
00:55:37,034 --> 00:55:38,769
Yeah, I, uh...

814
00:55:38,803 --> 00:55:42,407
I had a pretty good
run of luck.

815
00:55:42,440 --> 00:55:43,808
Gum?

816
00:55:44,942 --> 00:55:48,946
You know mama's
about to lose the house.

817
00:55:50,481 --> 00:55:53,384
And that
you're responsible.

818
00:55:53,418 --> 00:55:56,787
That's between me
and your mama,
little girl.

819
00:55:56,821 --> 00:55:59,890
I'm not your little girl
anymore.

820
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:03,861
Can I ask you
a question?

821
00:56:05,630 --> 00:56:07,432
Why...

822
00:56:07,832 --> 00:56:10,801
Can't we just
sit down and talk

823
00:56:10,835 --> 00:56:13,771
like any regular
father and daughter?

824
00:56:13,804 --> 00:56:15,706
Jesus Christ.

825
00:56:18,443 --> 00:56:21,579
You're incredible,
you know that?

826
00:56:25,616 --> 00:56:28,986
I'll tell you
a little story.

827
00:56:31,188 --> 00:56:34,124
It's about my
high school graduation.

828
00:56:34,158 --> 00:56:37,428
Now, that's a special
night for anybody.

829
00:56:37,462 --> 00:56:40,631
But for me,
it was really special.

830
00:56:40,665 --> 00:56:43,468
That night was for you.

831
00:56:43,768 --> 00:56:48,105
I wanted to show you
that I had grown up.

832
00:56:48,138 --> 00:56:50,875
I wanted you to realize
that all those years

833
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:52,610
you didn't
understand my music

834
00:56:52,643 --> 00:56:54,445
or my love for my music,

835
00:56:54,479 --> 00:56:58,716
we were both
just being stubborn.

836
00:56:58,749 --> 00:57:01,085
I wanted so bad...

837
00:57:01,118 --> 00:57:03,554
Just to impress you.

838
00:57:04,689 --> 00:57:07,658
Make you proud of me.

839
00:57:08,793 --> 00:57:10,194
Well, baby...

840
00:57:10,227 --> 00:57:12,029
I am proud.

841
00:57:12,062 --> 00:57:14,832
You didn't even show up.

842
00:57:15,666 --> 00:57:17,635
Where were you?

843
00:57:20,505 --> 00:57:23,073
Dallas?

844
00:57:23,574 --> 00:57:26,744
You were never there,
daddy.

845
00:57:27,612 --> 00:57:31,181
Not for me,
not for mama.

846
00:57:32,182 --> 00:57:37,622
That's why we just
can't sit down and talk

847
00:57:37,655 --> 00:57:40,725
like father and daughter.

848
00:58:26,871 --> 00:58:30,207
Maybe it's
a rotten thing to say,

849
00:58:30,240 --> 00:58:31,375
or even think,

850
00:58:31,408 --> 00:58:36,781
but Samantha has always
been Henry's favorite.

851
00:58:36,814 --> 00:58:38,549
He loved Kat...

852
00:58:38,583 --> 00:58:39,449
Adored her...

853
00:58:39,483 --> 00:58:42,887
But the way
he looked at Sam,

854
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:43,854
well...

855
00:58:43,888 --> 00:58:45,222
I knew it.

856
00:58:45,255 --> 00:58:46,323
Kat knew it.

857
00:58:46,356 --> 00:58:48,693
The whole damn town
knew it.

858
00:58:48,726 --> 00:58:52,863
The only one that didn't
know it was Samantha.

859
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:55,733
[Plays piano]

860
00:59:35,039 --> 00:59:40,110
Mr. Brady, I cannot
lose my home.

861
00:59:40,745 --> 00:59:42,613
It's not my decision.

862
00:59:42,647 --> 00:59:46,884
I can't tell you
how sorry I am.

863
01:00:08,973 --> 01:00:10,975
[Door opens]

864
01:00:13,410 --> 01:00:15,012
How'd it go?

865
01:00:15,045 --> 01:00:16,681
All right.

866
01:00:20,084 --> 01:00:21,786
All right?

867
01:00:25,055 --> 01:00:25,823
Darling...

868
01:00:25,856 --> 01:00:28,926
I ain't asking her
to sell the house.

869
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:29,559
I can't.

870
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:32,029
I know I owe you
the money,

871
01:00:32,062 --> 01:00:35,666
but I'll have to find
another way to get it.

872
01:00:35,700 --> 01:00:39,069
This trip's been
a waste of time?

873
01:00:39,103 --> 01:00:40,070
No.

874
01:00:40,104 --> 01:00:43,073
But I thought we agreed
to make this stupid trip

875
01:00:43,107 --> 01:00:46,343
so you could
make a deal with her

876
01:00:46,376 --> 01:00:47,778
to sell the house.

877
01:00:47,812 --> 01:00:50,848
I did want to see
my baby's wedding.

878
01:00:50,881 --> 01:00:53,751
Then she won't
sell the house?

879
01:00:53,784 --> 01:00:57,221
No, not now.

880
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,957
Samantha was here.

881
01:00:59,990 --> 01:01:00,958
Oh?

882
01:01:00,991 --> 01:01:02,292
Oh?

883
01:01:02,326 --> 01:01:06,396
Why did you tell me
you were divorced?

884
01:01:09,800 --> 01:01:11,902
I am.

885
01:01:18,342 --> 01:01:21,678
We finalized it today.

886
01:01:22,279 --> 01:01:24,248
I can read, Henry.

887
01:01:24,281 --> 01:01:26,383
You weren't divorced.

888
01:01:26,416 --> 01:01:28,418
You lied to me.

889
01:01:28,452 --> 01:01:30,755
Patsy, I was.

890
01:01:31,155 --> 01:01:34,024
Was what?

It don't matter now.

892
01:01:38,162 --> 01:01:39,964
It's done.

893
01:01:51,141 --> 01:01:53,310
What are you doing?

894
01:01:54,444 --> 01:01:56,180
I--i--I'm not lying.

895
01:01:56,213 --> 01:01:59,149
I was divorced...
Technically.

896
01:01:59,884 --> 01:02:03,020
Now you're out
on your butt...
Technically.

897

But, patsy--

900
01:02:11,428 --> 01:02:13,363
I'll need my money.

901
01:02:13,397 --> 01:02:14,899

Give me my money,

a couple of bucks

for the night.

Oh, I thought
you'd like to know.

Shigata called
while you were out.

908
01:02:40,457 --> 01:02:42,059
He signed the contract.

909
01:02:42,092 --> 01:02:44,394
Looks like I got me

01:02:44,428 --> 01:02:46,430
a Mercedes dealership.

911
01:02:46,463 --> 01:02:47,898
Now, wait a minute.

912
01:02:47,932 --> 01:02:49,366
That's
my dealership, too.

913
01:02:49,399 --> 01:02:52,102
I don't think so, Henry.

914
01:02:52,136 --> 01:02:54,338
I need a partner
I can trust.

915
01:02:54,371 --> 01:02:56,240
Patsy,
you listen to me.

916
01:02:56,273 --> 01:02:57,241
You listen to me.

917
01:02:57,274 --> 01:02:59,476
I don't live
with married men.

918
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:00,811
I told you that.

919
01:03:00,845 --> 01:03:02,913
Now just
a god damn minute.

920
01:03:02,947 --> 01:03:04,381
That's
my dealership, too.

921

Who sold all them cars?

922
01:03:06,216 --> 01:03:08,418
You're sloppy, Henry.

923
01:03:08,452 --> 01:03:10,587
You can't
do anything.

924
01:03:10,620 --> 01:03:13,190
Oh, you do have
one talent, I guess.

925
01:03:13,223 --> 01:03:15,459
I'll admit you're
pretty good at it,

but then I can buy that
just about anywhere...

928
01:03:23,868 --> 01:03:25,602
Oh, yeah.
I understand.

everybody's money.

out of your mind?

Can I use the head?

Can I get
a glass of water?

941
01:04:10,647 --> 01:04:12,349
Yes, Henry.

942

Jen, how come you never
talk about your saxophone?

943
01:04:16,220 --> 01:04:19,089
You were never
interested, Henry.

944
01:04:19,123 --> 01:04:21,926
You know what I think?

945
01:04:22,392 --> 01:04:24,561
I think
you always blamed me

946
01:04:24,594 --> 01:04:29,333
for a decision you made
before we even met.

You know what
the Indians say
about silver?

01:15:25,589 --> 01:15:27,724
[Laughs]

1108
01:15:28,257 --> 01:15:31,695
All those years.

1109
01:15:34,363 --> 01:15:36,032
What?

1110
01:15:36,065 --> 01:15:38,902
It's like
I had blinders on,

1111
01:15:38,935 --> 01:15:41,304
just like...

1112
01:15:41,337 --> 01:15:42,338
Your father.

1113
01:15:42,371 --> 01:15:47,010
Didn't want
to see anything
that was happening.

1114
01:15:47,744 --> 01:15:49,078
Didn't ask
any questions

1115
01:15:49,112 --> 01:15:50,980
for fear
that I'd find out

1116
01:15:51,014 --> 01:15:54,618
he was sleeping
with other women.

1117
01:15:54,851 --> 01:15:58,588
That wasn't
the only thing
I was afraid of,

1118
01:15:58,622 --> 01:15:59,689
but...

1119
01:15:59,723 --> 01:16:02,626
That's what
I feared most.

1120
01:16:04,894 --> 01:16:07,263
I fooled myself

1121
01:16:07,296 --> 01:16:09,132
into thinking...

1122
01:16:09,165 --> 01:16:12,035
That everything
was o.K.

1123
01:16:12,068 --> 01:16:15,038
And it wasn't.

1124
01:16:16,640 --> 01:16:18,708
Do you know
the main difference

1125
01:16:18,742 --> 01:16:22,145
between
your daddy and me?

1126
01:16:22,178 --> 01:16:23,847
He had the guts

1127
01:16:23,880 --> 01:16:26,850
to go for his dream,

1128
01:16:26,883 --> 01:16:28,752
even if it was late

1129
01:16:28,785 --> 01:16:32,321
and completely selfish...

1130
01:16:32,956 --> 01:16:35,659
And I didn't.

1131
01:16:44,133 --> 01:16:46,670
You're not coming?

1132
01:16:47,103 --> 01:16:49,673
No.

1133
01:17:22,405 --> 01:17:25,141
Can I come in?

1134
01:17:31,214 --> 01:17:34,684
What do you
want from me?

1135
01:17:39,388 --> 01:17:42,291
It's a choice, Sam.

1136
01:17:43,059 --> 01:17:46,429
It's a choice
everybody's got to make.

1137
01:17:46,462 --> 01:17:48,397
That's all.

1138
01:17:49,398 --> 01:17:51,701
And you know what?

1139
01:17:51,735 --> 01:17:56,005
You got to do it
all by yourself.

1140
01:18:00,176 --> 01:18:04,147
Why did you
throw it all away?

1141
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:09,953
Because, uh...

1142
01:18:12,288 --> 01:18:15,859
I was afraid,
I guess.

1143
01:18:15,892 --> 01:18:18,261
Afraid of what?

1144
01:18:18,762 --> 01:18:24,267
I saw what my father
did to my mama.

1145
01:18:26,035 --> 01:18:29,873
And I didn't
want that.

1146
01:18:29,906 --> 01:18:33,176
I still
don't want that.

1147
01:18:45,221 --> 01:18:47,190
O.k.

1148
01:18:54,463 --> 01:18:57,166
I am going
to miss you.

1149
01:18:57,200 --> 01:18:58,401
Oh, I want you

1150
01:18:58,434 --> 01:19:00,837
to take care
of yourself.

1151
01:19:00,870 --> 01:19:02,438
Recital...

1152
01:19:02,471 --> 01:19:04,808
Knock 'em dead.

1153
01:19:11,414 --> 01:19:13,449
Hold this, mama.

1154
01:19:25,094 --> 01:19:27,997
It's o.K., Sam.

1155
01:19:30,133 --> 01:19:32,235
I'll be here.

1156
01:19:39,408 --> 01:19:41,845
Goodbye, bill.

1157
01:19:47,016 --> 01:19:49,085
I love you.

1158
01:19:49,118 --> 01:19:50,486
I love you, too.

1159
01:19:50,519 --> 01:19:55,992
I have
a front row seat
reserved for you.

1160
01:19:56,625 --> 01:19:58,294
Maybe two.

1161
01:19:59,262 --> 01:20:01,865
[Laughs]

1162
01:20:06,903 --> 01:20:08,872
Bye.

1163
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:12,842
Goodbye.

1164
01:20:12,876 --> 01:20:14,878
Goodbye.

1165
01:20:17,981 --> 01:20:19,849
Do you know...

1166
01:20:19,883 --> 01:20:22,886
This is the first time
in my life

1167
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:25,922
I've ever been
entirely alone?

1168
01:20:26,655 --> 01:20:30,226
Without mama
or daddy or Henry

1169
01:20:30,259 --> 01:20:33,562
or one of my daughters
in the house.

1170
01:20:33,596 --> 01:20:35,264
I can't drive.

1171
01:20:35,298 --> 01:20:38,902
I don't have money
for the house.

1172
01:20:40,136 --> 01:20:42,271
It's a little bit...

1173
01:20:42,305 --> 01:20:42,838
Scary.

1174
01:20:42,872 --> 01:20:46,910
It's a little bit scary.

1175
01:21:09,465 --> 01:21:11,935
I got something
for you.

1176
01:21:40,096 --> 01:21:42,598
I'll be right out.

1177
01:22:12,761 --> 01:22:14,230
"Dear Jen,

1178
01:22:14,263 --> 01:22:16,332
"I owe you this.

1179
01:22:16,365 --> 01:22:17,967
"Goodbye.

1180
01:22:18,001 --> 01:22:20,403
Henry."

1181
01:22:26,409 --> 01:22:29,012
Henry.

1182
01:23:01,677 --> 01:23:03,679
What are you doing?

1183
01:23:03,712 --> 01:23:06,449
Teach me to drive.

1184
01:23:14,290 --> 01:23:16,259
Put that clutch in.

1185
01:23:16,292 --> 01:23:18,461
The one on the left.

1186
01:23:18,494 --> 01:23:19,328
Like this?

1187
01:23:19,362 --> 01:23:20,729
Turn on the engine.

1188
01:23:20,763 --> 01:23:22,431
Let the clutch out.

1189
01:23:22,465 --> 01:23:24,133
Here it goes.

1190
01:23:24,167 --> 01:23:25,601
Slow.

1191
01:23:28,337 --> 01:23:30,073
Do I make a right?

1192
01:23:30,106 --> 01:23:31,040
Yes.

1193
01:23:31,074 --> 01:23:31,707
Whoa!

1194
01:23:31,740 --> 01:23:33,376
Don't go so far.

1195
01:23:33,409 --> 01:23:35,078
Oh, my god.

1196
01:23:35,111 --> 01:23:35,644
Aah!

1197
01:23:35,678 --> 01:23:37,780
Now stay on the road.

1198
01:23:37,813 --> 01:23:39,582
Oh, my god.

1199
01:23:39,615 --> 01:23:43,186
So the house is safe.

1200
01:23:43,219 --> 01:23:46,622
I can pay off the bank.

1201
01:23:46,655 --> 01:23:48,391
I can't believe it.

1202
01:23:48,424 --> 01:23:49,258
Hell...

1203
01:23:49,292 --> 01:23:51,094
For once in his life,

1204
01:23:51,127 --> 01:23:53,329
Henry did
the right thing,

1205
01:23:53,362 --> 01:23:54,797
the decent thing,

1206
01:23:54,830 --> 01:23:57,666
the first really
unselfish act

1207
01:23:57,700 --> 01:23:59,502
of his whole life.

1208
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,303
Hi.

1209
01:24:00,336 --> 01:24:01,170
Where are you going?

1210
01:24:01,204 --> 01:24:04,740
I'm just going as far
as this road goes.

1211
01:24:04,773 --> 01:24:05,674
It's weird.

1212
01:24:05,708 --> 01:24:08,344
If I live to be
1,000 years old,

1213
01:24:08,377 --> 01:24:09,278
I'll be damned

1214
01:24:09,312 --> 01:24:12,815
if I'll ever
figure that man out.

1215
01:24:12,848 --> 01:24:15,451
Come on in.

1216
01:24:15,484 --> 01:24:16,352
Thank you.

1217
01:24:16,385 --> 01:24:18,121
You're welcome.

1218
01:24:20,856 --> 01:24:22,491
Whoop-de-do.

1219
01:24:22,525 --> 01:24:24,527
[Laughs]

1220
01:24:33,802 --> 01:24:34,770
Three days...

1221
01:24:34,803 --> 01:24:37,773
So much can happen
to the human heart

1222
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:40,109
in three days.

1223
01:24:40,143 --> 01:24:43,379
It beats
239,000 times...

1224
01:24:43,412 --> 01:24:45,381
In three days.

1225
01:24:45,414 --> 01:24:47,250
It can break.

1226
01:24:47,283 --> 01:24:49,418
It can be torn apart,

1227
01:24:49,452 --> 01:24:53,389
but it just
keeps on beating...

1228
01:24:53,422 --> 01:24:55,558
And beating.

1229
01:25:05,868 --> 01:25:08,504
* life is just a story

1230
01:25:08,537 --> 01:25:12,608
* that is stranger
than it seems *

1231
01:25:12,641 --> 01:25:14,877
* love is like
a fiery bolt *

1232
01:25:14,910 --> 01:25:18,281
* of hunger
through your dreams *

1233
01:25:18,314 --> 01:25:20,583
* and you come
so close together *

1234
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:24,853
* you could
tear yourselves apart *

1235
01:25:24,887 --> 01:25:28,357
* moving through
the flames of passion *

1236
01:25:28,391 --> 01:25:31,126
* with a paper heart

1237
01:25:34,530 --> 01:25:37,700
* won't you come
into my story? *

1238
01:25:37,733 --> 01:25:41,837
* you can bring
your mystery *

1239
01:25:41,870 --> 01:25:43,706
* touch me with the glory

1240
01:25:43,739 --> 01:25:46,709
* of your spirit
running free *

1241
01:25:46,742 --> 01:25:50,179
* we can straighten out
your feelings *

1242
01:25:50,213 --> 01:25:53,649
* while they're
tangled up in mine *

1243
01:25:53,682 --> 01:25:57,653
* we belong together,
darlin' *

1244
01:25:57,686 --> 01:26:01,357
* we're the wild kind

1245
01:26:07,663 --> 01:26:10,699
* somewhere down
the highway, darlin' *

1246
01:26:10,733 --> 01:26:13,769
* raise a glass to me

1247
01:26:13,802 --> 01:26:18,941
* one among a number
of your precious memories *

1248
01:26:18,974 --> 01:26:22,211
* never take yourself
for granted *

1249
01:26:22,245 --> 01:26:25,348
* darlin',
you deserve the best *

1250
01:26:25,381 --> 01:26:28,384
* and if you ever
need an outlaw *

1251
01:26:28,417 --> 01:26:31,787
* think of me
before the rest *
