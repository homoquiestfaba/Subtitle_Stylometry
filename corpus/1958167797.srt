1
00:00:34,273 --> 00:00:35,940
Please, let me go.

2
00:00:37,362 --> 00:00:39,464
No!

3
00:00:39,464 --> 00:00:41,114
I don't think so.

4
00:03:44,113 --> 00:03:46,666
It's such a beautiful,
beautiful day, Mia.

5
00:03:48,823 --> 00:03:51,946
You know, it reminds me
of the day you were born.

6
00:03:54,022 --> 00:03:55,483
The flowers are blooming.

7
00:03:55,483 --> 00:03:57,226
The birds are singing.

8
00:03:58,603 --> 00:04:01,726
The sky is so perfect and clear and blue.

9
00:04:03,793 --> 00:04:05,806
It's so peaceful and quiet.

10
00:04:07,723 --> 00:04:10,933
There is so much hope
for better days ahead.

11
00:04:10,933 --> 00:04:12,433
Shut up, mother!

12
00:04:12,433 --> 00:04:13,363
That's it.

13
00:04:13,363 --> 00:04:16,843
I have had it with you,
you ungrateful little brat!

14
00:04:16,843 --> 00:04:20,683
I have done everything for you
and this is how you treat me?

15
00:04:20,683 --> 00:04:22,603
How bout I shoot you right now?

16
00:04:22,603 --> 00:04:24,766
What are your last words, mom?

17
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:26,713
All right, all right,
everybody calm down.

18
00:04:26,713 --> 00:04:28,213
Take a deep breath, Mia.

19
00:04:28,213 --> 00:04:30,403
If you shoot me, I shoot her.

20
00:04:30,403 --> 00:04:31,813
So stay out of it.

21
00:04:31,813 --> 00:04:33,973
This is none of your
business, Detective Asshole!

22
00:04:33,973 --> 00:04:35,563
It's Detective Ross.

23
00:04:35,563 --> 00:04:39,103
Only my ex and my daughter get
to call me Detective Asshole.

24
00:04:39,103 --> 00:04:40,454
Now Mia,

25
00:04:40,454 --> 00:04:41,473
I want you to move your gun
and point it towards me.

26
00:04:41,473 --> 00:04:44,383
Don't worry, she's not
gonna shoot me or anyone else.

27
00:04:44,383 --> 00:04:46,033
She hasn't followed through with anything

28
00:04:46,033 --> 00:04:47,503
a day in her damn life.

29
00:04:47,503 --> 00:04:48,923
You see what she's doing?

30
00:04:48,923 --> 00:04:51,174
She's begging me to shoot her!

31
00:04:51,174 --> 00:04:52,007
Alice, you're not
helping here, all right?

32
00:04:52,007 --> 00:04:53,413
Mia, focus.

33
00:04:53,413 --> 00:04:55,423
I want you to move your gun over here.

34
00:04:55,423 --> 00:04:56,896
Mom's not going anywhere.

35
00:04:57,733 --> 00:04:59,460
We're gonna talk this out.

36
00:04:59,460 --> 00:05:00,351
No!

37
00:05:00,351 --> 00:05:01,944
That's it, that's it.

38
00:05:01,944 --> 00:05:03,043
I have had it with you, Mia!

39
00:05:03,043 --> 00:05:07,194
I have done everything for
you and you're so ungrateful.

40
00:05:07,194 --> 00:05:08,696
You ungrateful little brat!

41
00:05:08,696 --> 00:05:09,681
Alice, just shut up!

42
00:05:09,681 --> 00:05:11,361
I'm gonna shoot, I mean it!

43
00:05:11,361 --> 00:05:14,317
No!

44
00:05:19,685 --> 00:05:21,800
- Oh my God.
- I'm so sorry.

45
00:05:21,800 --> 00:05:23,747
Oh my, oh my God, baby.

46
00:05:23,747 --> 00:05:24,580
Oh my God, mom.

47
00:05:24,580 --> 00:05:25,914
- I love you so much.
- I'm so sorry.

48
00:05:25,914 --> 00:05:27,390
You could have been killed.

49
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:29,574
That man could have killed my baby.

50
00:05:29,574 --> 00:05:31,044
- I'm sorry.
- My baby's alive.

51
00:05:31,044 --> 00:05:32,500
Oh my God, oh my God.

52
00:05:32,500 --> 00:05:34,123
I'm so happy you're still alive.

53
00:05:34,123 --> 00:05:36,553
You almost killed my daughter.

54
00:05:36,553 --> 00:05:39,373
You monster, how could you shoot her?

55
00:05:39,373 --> 00:05:41,113
I shot her gun.

56
00:05:41,113 --> 00:05:43,063
You're alive, she's fine.

57
00:05:43,063 --> 00:05:46,260
I hope your daughter
doesn't get treated like this.

58
00:06:07,453 --> 00:06:09,706
Come on, please, I need a signal.

59
00:06:13,154 --> 00:06:14,749
Oh no.

60
00:06:14,749 --> 00:06:16,582
Not here, not now, no.

61
00:06:17,961 --> 00:06:19,273
Oh, come on, come on, come on.

62
00:06:19,273 --> 00:06:20,123
Pick up, pick up.

63
00:06:22,243 --> 00:06:23,503
Daddy, I messed up.

64
00:06:23,503 --> 00:06:25,243
I'm sorry.

65
00:06:25,243 --> 00:06:28,153
I shouldn't have come here, it's so shady.

66
00:06:28,153 --> 00:06:30,946
But it's worse than that, I'm in trouble.

67
00:06:31,963 --> 00:06:33,343
They're coming from me.

68
00:06:33,343 --> 00:06:34,726
They can smell the blood.

69
00:06:36,111 --> 00:06:37,843
They're going to-

70
00:06:37,843 --> 00:06:40,007
Where do you think you were going, Faye?

71
00:06:40,007 --> 00:06:41,207
No, please, let me go.

72
00:06:45,343 --> 00:06:47,103
Who do you talk to?

73
00:06:47,103 --> 00:06:48,253
No one.

74
00:06:48,253 --> 00:06:50,023
Please, why won't you let me go?

75
00:06:50,023 --> 00:06:52,131
Dr. Pavor has big plans.

76
00:06:52,131 --> 00:06:52,964
Let's go, let's go.
No, no.

77
00:06:52,964 --> 00:06:55,122
Please don't take me
back to Dr. Pavor, no!

78
00:07:00,785 --> 00:07:04,126
Dr. Pavor, do you want to
know what happened to Faye?

79
00:07:04,126 --> 00:07:05,023
Is she still alive?

80
00:07:05,023 --> 00:07:08,135
Yes, but you should
have seen what I did.

81
00:07:08,135 --> 00:07:08,968
Not now.

82
00:07:12,259 --> 00:07:13,746
Can you see that I'm busy here?

83
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,213
Last chance to change your mind.

84
00:07:19,213 --> 00:07:21,643
Cheap surgery across the
border is never a good idea.

85
00:07:21,643 --> 00:07:23,533
I've heard the place
has some decent reviews.

86
00:07:23,533 --> 00:07:24,703
Heard it from who?

87
00:07:24,703 --> 00:07:26,342
Doesn't matter.

88
00:07:26,342 --> 00:07:27,175
We got a week off our classes

89
00:07:27,175 --> 00:07:29,345
and just enough money to pull this off.

90
00:07:29,345 --> 00:07:30,283
We're doing this.

91
00:07:30,283 --> 00:07:32,053
And you really think
Bobby's gonna believe

92
00:07:32,053 --> 00:07:35,233
you suddenly went from a
B cup to a D in a week?

93
00:07:35,233 --> 00:07:36,066
Yes.

94
00:07:36,950 --> 00:07:38,743
Bobby believes everything that I say.

95
00:07:38,743 --> 00:07:40,600
I mean, he's really sweet,

96
00:07:40,600 --> 00:07:42,163
but let's be honest, he's kind of dumb.

97
00:07:42,163 --> 00:07:44,356
Which by the way, is
what I like about him.

98
00:07:45,553 --> 00:07:47,896
Okay guys, we're doing this.

99
00:07:49,778 --> 00:07:51,306
Like what's the worst that could happen?

100
00:07:52,663 --> 00:07:55,509
Are we supposed to have this much blood?

101
00:07:55,509 --> 00:07:57,109
Oh, the surgery was a success.

102
00:07:59,173 --> 00:08:00,023
You two clean up.

103
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:14,466
Mm.

104
00:08:16,903 --> 00:08:18,463
What are you doing, Anna?

105
00:08:18,463 --> 00:08:19,426
Are you crazy?

106
00:08:21,253 --> 00:08:23,086
Crazy, what do you mean?

107
00:08:24,012 --> 00:08:25,753
It says we're supposed
to drive for four hours

108
00:08:25,753 --> 00:08:27,643
where no one lives,

109
00:08:27,643 --> 00:08:30,348
then hit a small town near the border

110
00:08:30,348 --> 00:08:32,203
where we meet in a bookstore.

111
00:08:32,203 --> 00:08:34,393
That doesn't sound sketchy to any of you?

112
00:08:34,393 --> 00:08:35,943
Madison, just get in the car.

113
00:08:36,897 --> 00:08:37,979
Come on.

114
00:08:49,423 --> 00:08:51,283
Well, at
least the drive is scenic.

115
00:08:51,283 --> 00:08:54,103
I'm gonna be
scenic after my surgery.

116
00:08:54,103 --> 00:08:56,533
Was that a joke, Skylar?

117
00:08:56,533 --> 00:08:59,023
You don't usually joke
when driving a long ways.

118
00:08:59,023 --> 00:09:01,093
I'm happy, is that crazy?

119
00:09:01,093 --> 00:09:02,713
You're happy?

120
00:09:02,713 --> 00:09:04,033
Can I drive your car then?

121
00:09:04,033 --> 00:09:05,323
I'm not that happy.

122
00:09:05,323 --> 00:09:06,463
Come on.

123
00:09:06,463 --> 00:09:08,203
You can use a brake from driving.

124
00:09:08,203 --> 00:09:10,503
You're not
driving my car, Madison.

125
00:09:13,753 --> 00:09:15,453
This is it, pull over.

126
00:10:20,353 --> 00:10:22,276
Take a picture, it lasts longer.

127
00:10:24,931 --> 00:10:26,473
Damn, he actually took a picture.

128
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:27,493
Do something, Quinn.

129
00:10:27,493 --> 00:10:28,443
I got this, babe.

130
00:10:29,285 --> 00:10:30,733
Hey, are you Tony?

131
00:10:30,733 --> 00:10:33,133
That's me, I'm Tony.

132
00:10:33,133 --> 00:10:35,323
Wait, so you're the guy
we're supposed to meet

133
00:10:35,323 --> 00:10:37,543
to find out where the surgery center is?

134
00:10:37,543 --> 00:10:40,333
I wouldn't call it a surgery center.

135
00:10:40,333 --> 00:10:42,133
What would you call it then?

136
00:10:42,133 --> 00:10:45,524
I think of it more as a big house.

137
00:10:45,524 --> 00:10:46,566
It's a short walk from here.

138
00:10:47,642 --> 00:10:48,754
Walk?

139
00:10:48,754 --> 00:10:49,587
No cars allowed.

140
00:10:49,587 --> 00:10:51,733
You guys walk to the house from here.

141
00:10:51,733 --> 00:10:54,793
I didn't bring any hiking shoes.

142
00:10:54,793 --> 00:10:56,206
How long is this walk?

143
00:10:57,043 --> 00:10:58,753
Uh, about a mile or two.

144
00:10:58,753 --> 00:11:00,043
The website didn't say anything

145
00:11:00,043 --> 00:11:03,043
about walking two miles in the desert.

146
00:11:03,043 --> 00:11:04,543
Look, it's a shaded path.

147
00:11:04,543 --> 00:11:06,613
Woods, not a desert.

148
00:11:06,613 --> 00:11:09,793
This is how we cross
the border undetected.

149
00:11:09,793 --> 00:11:11,782
Follow a stream,

150
00:11:11,782 --> 00:11:14,618
you reach a storm drain
and there's a tunnel.

151
00:11:14,618 --> 00:11:15,553
Dude, this is crazy.

152
00:11:15,553 --> 00:11:18,298
You want the cheapest
plastic surgery performed

153
00:11:18,298 --> 00:11:20,503
with high quality and under the radar.

154
00:11:20,503 --> 00:11:21,553
You know what I mean?

155
00:11:22,460 --> 00:11:23,599
I, I get it.

156
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:25,003
No taxes, no paperwork,

157
00:11:25,003 --> 00:11:27,823
no malpractice insurance, low overhead.

158
00:11:27,823 --> 00:11:30,493
Yes, you get it, amigo.

159
00:11:30,493 --> 00:11:33,193
Dr. Pavor is the best, you know?

160
00:11:33,193 --> 00:11:34,813
I understand the business plan,

161
00:11:34,813 --> 00:11:39,283
but we were fully expecting
a shuttle, not to hike there.

162
00:11:39,283 --> 00:11:40,946
It's the only way.

163
00:11:40,946 --> 00:11:42,780
No one even knows you're there.

164
00:11:42,780 --> 00:11:43,613
You save thousands.

165
00:11:43,613 --> 00:11:45,583
But if you guys want to cancel,

166
00:11:45,583 --> 00:11:47,863
I have to contact them.

167
00:11:47,863 --> 00:11:50,533
Dr. Pavor is expecting you today.

168
00:11:50,533 --> 00:11:52,126
Uh, I vote for turning back.

169
00:11:54,043 --> 00:11:56,743
We're going, we're gonna do this.

170
00:11:56,743 --> 00:11:59,382
I'm sure the place is safe.

171
00:12:09,883 --> 00:12:10,716
Brenda, is that you?

172
00:12:10,716 --> 00:12:12,463
I can't get the restraints free.

173
00:12:12,463 --> 00:12:14,173
Well, you didn't get out when I did?

174
00:12:14,173 --> 00:12:15,674
They caught me.

175
00:12:15,674 --> 00:12:16,792
I didn't make it in time.

176
00:12:16,792 --> 00:12:17,625
I left a message for my dad.

177
00:12:17,625 --> 00:12:18,586
He'll find us.

178
00:12:19,458 --> 00:12:21,221
I don't think we have a lot of time.

179
00:12:21,221 --> 00:12:22,054
I can barely walk.

180
00:12:22,054 --> 00:12:23,794
We need to get out now.

181
00:12:28,393 --> 00:12:29,983
Hey, what's happening?

182
00:12:29,983 --> 00:12:32,476
Dr. Pavor wanted me
to bring Faye to him.

183
00:12:33,403 --> 00:12:35,103
Will you help me bring her to him?

184
00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:37,513
Liar.

185
00:12:37,513 --> 00:12:38,806
No, no, no.

186
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:41,998
You suck.

187
00:12:41,998 --> 00:12:43,398
No wait,

188
00:12:43,398 --> 00:12:45,756
I suck.

189
00:12:46,900 --> 00:12:47,733
Run, Brenda!

190
00:12:51,943 --> 00:12:54,403
Faye, I really don't appreciate you

191
00:12:54,403 --> 00:12:57,234
grabbing my uniform and wrinkling it.

192
00:12:57,234 --> 00:12:59,416
I only have one and I hate ironing.

193
00:13:01,513 --> 00:13:06,226
I'd really like to punish
you and to drink your blood,

194
00:13:07,123 --> 00:13:09,856
but Dr. Pavor has big plans for you.

195
00:13:19,708 --> 00:13:21,233
Detective Ross.

196
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:22,393
Oh Susan, what's up?

197
00:13:22,393 --> 00:13:24,436
No, I haven't seen Faye.

198
00:13:25,453 --> 00:13:27,823
You know, I barely see her anymore.

199
00:13:27,823 --> 00:13:29,823
We don't have the best relationship now.

200
00:13:31,333 --> 00:13:32,533
You think she's missing?

201
00:13:33,943 --> 00:13:34,776
Well, why?

202
00:13:36,403 --> 00:13:38,453
When was the last time you talked to her?

203
00:13:40,003 --> 00:13:44,416
She said she was going to
Mexico for spring break, really?

204
00:13:47,407 --> 00:13:48,376
Ah, yeah.

205
00:13:48,376 --> 00:13:50,556
So she shouldn't back
like what, two days ago?

206
00:13:52,003 --> 00:13:53,453
All right, listen, calm down.

207
00:13:54,343 --> 00:13:58,606
I'm sure she's gonna be fine,
but let me look into it.

208
00:14:00,553 --> 00:14:01,386
All right, bye.

209
00:14:08,884 --> 00:14:10,871
Daddy, I, I messed up.

210
00:14:10,871 --> 00:14:11,795
I'm sorry.

211
00:14:11,795 --> 00:14:13,819
I shouldn't have come here.

212
00:14:13,819 --> 00:14:15,819
It's so shady, but it's worse than that.

213
00:14:16,861 --> 00:14:18,013
I'm in trouble.

214
00:14:18,013 --> 00:14:19,113
They're coming for me.

215
00:14:20,304 --> 00:14:21,947
They can smell the blood.

216
00:14:21,947 --> 00:14:23,656
They're going to-

217
00:14:31,843 --> 00:14:34,655
You look like a-

218
00:14:34,655 --> 00:14:36,561
- Jesus.
- Shh.

219
00:14:36,561 --> 00:14:37,719
Where is he?

220
00:14:37,719 --> 00:14:38,552
I don't know.

221
00:14:38,552 --> 00:14:39,851
I can't tell you.

222
00:14:39,851 --> 00:14:40,684
I don't know where he is, I swear.

223
00:14:40,684 --> 00:14:42,346
Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob, Bob.

224
00:14:46,663 --> 00:14:48,163
Hey Joe, what's up?

225
00:14:48,163 --> 00:14:49,423
You busy?

226
00:14:49,423 --> 00:14:52,783
Uh, never for you, uh, I still owe you.

227
00:14:52,783 --> 00:14:54,193
What's the problem?

228
00:14:54,193 --> 00:14:55,393
Faye's missing.

229
00:14:55,393 --> 00:14:56,983
She went down to Mexico for spring break

230
00:14:56,983 --> 00:14:58,546
and she hasn't come back.

231
00:14:59,413 --> 00:15:00,313
She's left this phone message

232
00:15:00,313 --> 00:15:01,836
which scared the hell outta me.

233
00:15:03,511 --> 00:15:05,197
I think she's been abducted.

234
00:15:05,197 --> 00:15:06,434
What can I do?

235
00:15:06,434 --> 00:15:07,303
I need you to help me find her.

236
00:15:07,303 --> 00:15:08,136
You got it.

237
00:15:10,483 --> 00:15:12,703
If you guys are gonna
leaving for the clinic soon,

238
00:15:12,703 --> 00:15:13,813
it's getting late,

239
00:15:13,813 --> 00:15:16,672
and you guys should not be
walking around there at night

240
00:15:16,672 --> 00:15:17,505
because you won't find it.

241
00:15:17,505 --> 00:15:19,273
We just need another minute.

242
00:15:19,273 --> 00:15:20,143
I need a word with my friends.

243
00:15:20,143 --> 00:15:22,303
We're going, what's there to talk about?

244
00:15:22,303 --> 00:15:23,653
We need another minute.

245
00:15:23,653 --> 00:15:25,549
It's getting late, guys,

246
00:15:25,549 --> 00:15:26,413
and you guys don't wanna
be walking on the path

247
00:15:26,413 --> 00:15:27,313
when it's dark.

248
00:15:27,313 --> 00:15:29,378
So you keep saying.

249
00:15:29,378 --> 00:15:31,571
She said give us a minute,
so give us a minute.

250
00:15:31,571 --> 00:15:32,404
Fine.

251
00:15:36,133 --> 00:15:39,118
I know I keep saying it over and over,

252
00:15:39,118 --> 00:15:40,543
but this all really sounds crazy.

253
00:15:40,543 --> 00:15:42,828
Hiking in the woods through a tunnel

254
00:15:42,828 --> 00:15:45,523
to cross the border illegally
just to get cheap surgery?

255
00:15:45,523 --> 00:15:47,849
I don't like the hiking part,

256
00:15:47,849 --> 00:15:48,853
but the rest is what I expected.

257
00:15:48,853 --> 00:15:50,509
Me too, babe.

258
00:15:50,509 --> 00:15:52,488
I can't wait till you
get that tight kitty.

259
00:15:52,488 --> 00:15:55,517
Careful, you
can get lost in there.

260
00:15:55,517 --> 00:15:56,669
Not for long.

261
00:15:56,669 --> 00:15:57,502
Speaking of not long.

262
00:15:57,502 --> 00:15:59,773
That won't be an issue
either, after the surgery.

263
00:15:59,773 --> 00:16:01,993
Will you two quit feeling each other up?

264
00:16:01,993 --> 00:16:03,286
There are ladies present.

265
00:16:04,543 --> 00:16:05,803
You know, Maddie,

266
00:16:05,803 --> 00:16:08,986
I bet Dr. Pavor performs sex changes too,

267
00:16:09,882 --> 00:16:10,843
if you're interested.

268
00:16:10,843 --> 00:16:11,713
Mm, I'm good.

269
00:16:11,713 --> 00:16:13,993
My sexual preference is not a problem.

270
00:16:13,993 --> 00:16:16,043
Besides, one dick on this trip is plenty.

271
00:16:17,435 --> 00:16:19,183
You guys decided yet?

272
00:16:19,183 --> 00:16:20,685
I'm going.

273
00:16:20,685 --> 00:16:21,518
Me too.

274
00:16:21,518 --> 00:16:22,633
Well, if you're all going, I'm going.

275
00:16:22,633 --> 00:16:25,036
I'm going even if I
have to hike in heels.

276
00:16:30,073 --> 00:16:31,933
Hold on guys, hold on.

277
00:16:31,933 --> 00:16:33,283
- Thanks babe.
- Okay.

278
00:16:33,283 --> 00:16:36,103
Guys, if we keep stopping,
we won't make it before dark.

279
00:16:36,103 --> 00:16:37,453
So what happens then?

280
00:16:37,453 --> 00:16:39,973
I don't know, werewolves.

281
00:16:39,973 --> 00:16:41,632
Guys, I think he means

282
00:16:41,632 --> 00:16:43,693
that it would be really
hard to stay on path.

283
00:16:43,693 --> 00:16:45,856
And he only gave us one flashlight, so.

284
00:16:47,205 --> 00:16:49,439
How was I supposed to
know I need hiking shoes?

285
00:16:49,439 --> 00:16:51,126
Yeah, they didn't really
mention on the website.

286
00:16:55,243 --> 00:16:56,296
March on, Maddie.

287
00:17:40,313 --> 00:17:43,368
Daddy, I, I messed up, I'm sorry.

288
00:17:43,368 --> 00:17:44,954
I shouldn't have come here.

289
00:17:44,954 --> 00:17:47,473
It's so shady, but it's worse than that.

290
00:17:47,473 --> 00:17:48,306
I'm in trouble.

291
00:17:55,423 --> 00:17:56,423
Talk to me, Steve.

292
00:17:57,463 --> 00:17:59,327
She's somewhere in Mexico.

293
00:17:59,327 --> 00:18:00,853
She must have stopped before the border.

294
00:18:00,853 --> 00:18:02,503
The cops are working on that now.

295
00:18:03,474 --> 00:18:05,349
You think the cops down
there are gonna help me?

296
00:18:05,349 --> 00:18:06,506
Give me a break.

297
00:18:06,506 --> 00:18:08,359
Okay, I'll keep looking.

298
00:18:08,359 --> 00:18:09,236
She's my daughter.

299
00:18:09,236 --> 00:18:10,069
I need to find her, damn it.

300
00:18:10,069 --> 00:18:11,113
I'm on it.

301
00:18:11,113 --> 00:18:12,703
All right, you know what?

302
00:18:12,703 --> 00:18:15,645
I'm gonna get in my car and
I'm gonna start heading south.

303
00:18:15,645 --> 00:18:16,963
Just call me when you got something.

304
00:18:16,963 --> 00:18:18,703
It's worse than that.

305
00:18:18,703 --> 00:18:19,536
I'm in trouble.

306
00:18:20,503 --> 00:18:22,123
They're coming for me.

307
00:18:22,123 --> 00:18:23,373
They can smell the blood.

308
00:18:24,432 --> 00:18:25,731
They're going to-

309
00:18:39,583 --> 00:18:41,863
If I'm reading this
right, that's the tunnel.

310
00:18:41,863 --> 00:18:42,696
We should go in.

311
00:18:43,723 --> 00:18:46,343
You want us to go in your tunnel?

312
00:18:46,343 --> 00:18:47,553
Ow.

313
00:19:29,863 --> 00:19:31,723
The tunnel's really dark.

314
00:19:31,723 --> 00:19:33,193
I wonder how long it is.

315
00:19:33,193 --> 00:19:35,782
Yeah, I'm not gonna touch that one.

316
00:19:35,782 --> 00:19:36,615
Low hanging fruit.

317
00:19:59,635 --> 00:20:01,543
Please let me go!

318
00:20:01,543 --> 00:20:03,616
I won't tell anyone what goes on there.

319
00:20:04,618 --> 00:20:06,167
I promise.

320
00:20:06,167 --> 00:20:07,509
And I am supposed to trust you?

321
00:20:07,509 --> 00:20:11,252
Yes, you probably never have
much reason to trust anyone,

322
00:20:11,252 --> 00:20:12,126
but you can trust me.

323
00:20:13,045 --> 00:20:15,400
I, I'm sure you've had a hard life,

324
00:20:15,400 --> 00:20:18,480
but maybe just once by
trusting just one person,

325
00:20:18,480 --> 00:20:21,393
by trusting me, your whole
life can change for the better.

326
00:20:23,715 --> 00:20:26,002
No!

327
00:20:26,002 --> 00:20:27,585
I don't think so.

328
00:21:38,399 --> 00:21:40,816
Thank you for your service.

329
00:21:56,773 --> 00:21:57,796
Well, we made it.

330
00:21:59,035 --> 00:21:59,923
We're in Mexico.

331
00:21:59,923 --> 00:22:02,776
We need to pick up the
pace before it gets dark.

332
00:22:04,532 --> 00:22:05,533
Stop looking at me.

333
00:22:05,533 --> 00:22:06,943
Just leave her alone.

334
00:22:06,943 --> 00:22:09,173
I'm 100%, absolutely totally sure

335
00:22:10,010 --> 00:22:11,273
we'll make it before it gets dark.

336
00:22:26,243 --> 00:22:28,006
Okay, okay, sorry.

337
00:22:29,013 --> 00:22:31,656
Actually we're almost there,
so no one loses their shit.

338
00:22:46,663 --> 00:22:48,496
According to the map, we're here.

339
00:22:50,563 --> 00:22:53,962
Looks more like a home than a hospital.

340
00:22:53,962 --> 00:22:56,223
That's what the freaky
dude that the bookstore said.

341
00:22:56,223 --> 00:22:58,416
When Tony said it was under
the radar, he wasn't kidding.

342
00:22:59,833 --> 00:23:02,476
Last chance to turn back
and make a run for it.

343
00:23:04,129 --> 00:23:05,547
Don't be such a pussy.

344
00:23:05,547 --> 00:23:06,845
Meow, bitch.

345
00:23:06,845 --> 00:23:07,678
Speaking of a bitch-

346
00:23:07,678 --> 00:23:09,345
- Don't say it.
- Ow.

347
00:23:29,908 --> 00:23:31,296
Aren't, aren't they expecting us?

348
00:23:32,151 --> 00:23:32,984
Maybe it's after hours.

349
00:23:32,984 --> 00:23:34,913
We were supposed to get here before dark.

350
00:23:39,523 --> 00:23:40,576
Please, come in.

351
00:23:47,911 --> 00:23:49,363
Fuck me.

352
00:23:49,363 --> 00:23:51,463
Keep it in your pants, perv.

353
00:23:51,463 --> 00:23:52,863
That is, if you can find it.

354
00:23:54,510 --> 00:23:56,244
Hi, I'm Skylar Winslow.

355
00:23:56,244 --> 00:23:58,663
Dr. Pavor is expecting me and my friends.

356
00:23:58,663 --> 00:24:01,052
We were expecting three of you.

357
00:24:01,052 --> 00:24:01,885
Who's the other?

358
00:24:01,885 --> 00:24:05,353
Uh, her and I, we're,
we're here for some work.

359
00:24:05,353 --> 00:24:06,856
I'm here for moral support.

360
00:24:08,411 --> 00:24:09,244
Excellent.

361
00:24:10,633 --> 00:24:13,006
We sometimes lack of morals here,

362
00:24:13,901 --> 00:24:15,751
so your visit is greatly appreciated.

363
00:24:16,944 --> 00:24:18,259
You're the surgeon?

364
00:24:18,259 --> 00:24:19,309
Yes, I'm Dr. Pavor.

365
00:24:20,803 --> 00:24:23,953
And all your questions will
be answered soon enough.

366
00:24:23,953 --> 00:24:25,273
But for now,

367
00:24:25,273 --> 00:24:28,636
just follow Maria Angela to
your rooms and get situated.

368
00:24:30,809 --> 00:24:31,809
Follow me.

369
00:24:42,009 --> 00:24:44,017
Are you checking out her as?

370
00:24:44,017 --> 00:24:45,617
I have eyes and I am not dead.

371
00:24:54,584 --> 00:24:56,173
Shh, shh, shh.

372
00:24:56,173 --> 00:24:58,363
I understand there was some excitement

373
00:24:58,363 --> 00:24:59,833
in your room earlier.

374
00:24:59,833 --> 00:25:01,884
What happened to Brenda?

375
00:25:01,884 --> 00:25:02,793
Oh, no, no.

376
00:25:02,793 --> 00:25:06,073
Don't you worry your little
pretty head about Brenda.

377
00:25:06,073 --> 00:25:08,623
Maria Angela is taking care of her.

378
00:25:08,623 --> 00:25:13,623
Now, no more thoughts about leaving, okay?

379
00:25:13,753 --> 00:25:15,295
Please.

380
00:25:15,295 --> 00:25:16,873
Please what, my dear?

381
00:25:16,873 --> 00:25:18,943
Please let me die.

382
00:25:18,943 --> 00:25:20,317
No, no, no, no.

383
00:25:20,317 --> 00:25:21,523
You are not going to die.

384
00:25:21,523 --> 00:25:24,436
You are going through
the transitional phase.

385
00:25:28,963 --> 00:25:30,367
No.

386
00:25:30,367 --> 00:25:33,820
You are going to feel
much, much better now.

387
00:25:33,820 --> 00:25:35,113
No, don't.

388
00:25:35,113 --> 00:25:36,931
Please, please, I hate needles.

389
00:25:36,931 --> 00:25:38,281
Well, that's unfortunate.

390
00:25:40,308 --> 00:25:43,237
Then you're really not gonna like this.

391
00:26:07,603 --> 00:26:10,756
Hey Steve, I found Faye's calendar.

392
00:26:10,756 --> 00:26:12,490
It looks like she's
headed to some bookstore

393
00:26:12,490 --> 00:26:13,573
north of the Mexican border.

394
00:26:13,573 --> 00:26:14,413
I'm heading there now.

395
00:26:14,413 --> 00:26:16,483
I'm gonna text you the address.

396
00:26:16,483 --> 00:26:17,893
So hopefully you'll meet me there

397
00:26:17,893 --> 00:26:20,646
or maybe you can even get there
before me and check it out.

398
00:26:28,273 --> 00:26:30,283
There's nothing wrong with your breasts.

399
00:26:30,283 --> 00:26:33,136
So you told me a million times.

400
00:26:34,827 --> 00:26:36,846
I just wish I could
have talked you out of it.

401
00:26:37,713 --> 00:26:39,253
I feel like such a lousy friend.

402
00:26:39,253 --> 00:26:41,986
Well, you're here, so that's not lousy.

403
00:26:44,783 --> 00:26:47,146
Madison, follow me.

404
00:27:04,003 --> 00:27:04,836
Hell no.

405
00:27:14,173 --> 00:27:16,306
You ever think about getting into porn?

406
00:27:17,249 --> 00:27:18,253
You got the body for it.

407
00:27:18,253 --> 00:27:19,693
I prefer nursing.

408
00:27:19,693 --> 00:27:20,836
You prefer nursing?

409
00:27:21,763 --> 00:27:23,386
Sign me up, I'll nurse from you.

410
00:27:25,033 --> 00:27:29,023
So do you assist the doctor
with some of his procedures?

411
00:27:29,023 --> 00:27:30,013
Yes.

412
00:27:30,013 --> 00:27:33,946
So do you know much
about vaginal rejuvenation?

413
00:27:34,819 --> 00:27:35,773
Yeah, what do you
know about the vajayjay?

414
00:27:35,773 --> 00:27:38,623
The doctor will answer
all of your questions now.

415
00:27:38,623 --> 00:27:40,036
Please, follow me, Alana.

416
00:27:41,743 --> 00:27:43,276
Just Alana for now, Quinn.

417
00:27:44,725 --> 00:27:45,975
You'll be next.

418
00:27:56,012 --> 00:27:58,873
So is this where we'll
be staying tonight?

419
00:27:58,873 --> 00:27:59,746
Sleep now.

420
00:28:03,763 --> 00:28:05,353
You don't have to leave.

421
00:28:05,353 --> 00:28:09,013
I mean, if you want to hang out,

422
00:28:09,013 --> 00:28:11,776
we could get to know each
other a little better.

423
00:28:15,531 --> 00:28:16,626
What's with the face paint?

424
00:28:19,066 --> 00:28:21,313
You, you don't say much, do you?

425
00:28:21,313 --> 00:28:24,073
Personally, I, I think
talking is overrated.

426
00:28:24,073 --> 00:28:25,603
You ever see "The Little Mermaid?"

427
00:28:25,603 --> 00:28:28,268
Well, the chick in that film
doesn't talk much either,

428
00:28:28,268 --> 00:28:30,043
and I had the biggest crush on her.

429
00:28:30,043 --> 00:28:31,513
She was hot for a cartoon and,

430
00:28:31,513 --> 00:28:33,256
and pretty naked too at one point.

431
00:28:34,153 --> 00:28:34,986
You know what?

432
00:28:34,986 --> 00:28:35,863
I think that's the first time

433
00:28:35,863 --> 00:28:38,776
I realized I liked girls, and fins.

434
00:28:42,622 --> 00:28:44,593
I used to imagine Ariel grew
up to be Jessica Rabbit.

435
00:28:44,593 --> 00:28:47,346
Probably, because they were
both redheads, just like you.

436
00:28:52,273 --> 00:28:53,266
Great job, Maddie.

437
00:28:54,759 --> 00:28:55,626
Scared off another one.

438
00:28:58,453 --> 00:28:59,926
Welcome, Ms. Roberts.

439
00:29:00,853 --> 00:29:02,506
Tell me about yourself, Alana.

440
00:29:03,833 --> 00:29:05,023
You have my file, right?

441
00:29:05,023 --> 00:29:07,486
I just wanna know more about you.

442
00:29:08,686 --> 00:29:11,537
Like for example, how many
of your friends and family

443
00:29:11,537 --> 00:29:13,926
know that you went to Mexico
for a plastic surgery?

444
00:29:14,790 --> 00:29:17,083
Hmm, just my friends that are here.

445
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,693
And what type of work do you do?

446
00:29:19,693 --> 00:29:21,166
I'm a porn star.

447
00:29:22,367 --> 00:29:25,993
Well, no, I should say I'm a porn actress,

448
00:29:25,993 --> 00:29:27,883
to pay my way through school.

449
00:29:27,883 --> 00:29:30,166
I'm not a star, yet.

450
00:29:31,554 --> 00:29:33,223
But hey, if you're willing
to gimme any discounts,

451
00:29:33,223 --> 00:29:35,176
I can give you the full star treatment.

452
00:29:36,420 --> 00:29:38,606
What sort of work do you do?

453
00:29:38,606 --> 00:29:41,713
Well, I'm a student
and undeclared major.

454
00:29:41,713 --> 00:29:45,646
But, uh, don't worry about
paying for the surgery.

455
00:29:45,646 --> 00:29:48,497
I have a little inheritance
from my grandma.

456
00:29:48,497 --> 00:29:50,546
What sort of work do you do?

457
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:51,470
I'm a student.

458
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:52,363
So far I'm an accounting major.

459
00:29:52,363 --> 00:29:54,763
Hey, maybe I could do
your taxes for a discount.

460
00:29:58,155 --> 00:29:59,107
It's not that I think

461
00:29:59,107 --> 00:30:00,768
there's something wrong with them,

462
00:30:00,768 --> 00:30:03,461
it's just that I want
'em to be a little more.

463
00:30:03,461 --> 00:30:05,623
Bigger, down there.

464
00:30:05,623 --> 00:30:07,183
On top.

465
00:30:07,183 --> 00:30:08,896
You heard of the Grand Canyon?

466
00:30:10,183 --> 00:30:14,143
Well, that's what it's
like between my thighs.

467
00:30:14,143 --> 00:30:16,910
Miss Roberts, have you
had a a baby recently?

468
00:30:17,901 --> 00:30:18,811
God no.

469
00:30:18,811 --> 00:30:20,413
I'm not ready for that nightmare.

470
00:30:20,413 --> 00:30:24,403
Well, it's just that you're
rather to vaginoplasty.

471
00:30:24,403 --> 00:30:27,703
Have you ever seen a porn, Doc?

472
00:30:27,703 --> 00:30:30,763
Male talent is huge.

473
00:30:30,763 --> 00:30:35,173
Plus, I've done my share of gang bangs.

474
00:30:35,173 --> 00:30:38,080
You are not alone, Miss Winslow.

475
00:30:38,080 --> 00:30:38,913
You know,

476
00:30:38,913 --> 00:30:42,613
breast enhancement is one of
my most popular procedures.

477
00:30:42,613 --> 00:30:46,693
Now, do you have any
size or shape in mind?

478
00:30:46,693 --> 00:30:49,963
Um, maybe a cup or two bigger.

479
00:30:49,963 --> 00:30:53,386
Definitely noticeable,
but natural looking.

480
00:30:54,316 --> 00:30:56,953
I really want, like when I'm a
small business owner one day,

481
00:30:56,953 --> 00:30:58,963
for clients to see my photo

482
00:30:58,963 --> 00:31:01,816
and wanna come in and be my customer.

483
00:31:01,816 --> 00:31:02,649
You know what I mean?

484
00:31:02,649 --> 00:31:04,283
You know, penile
implants are not as rare

485
00:31:05,308 --> 00:31:06,141
as what you think.

486
00:31:06,141 --> 00:31:07,613
They're just less discussed, you know?

487
00:31:09,190 --> 00:31:12,553
So have you heard of the
penile map procedure?

488
00:31:13,993 --> 00:31:17,353
Well, the process can take about an hour

489
00:31:17,353 --> 00:31:19,846
and it comes in three different sizes.

490
00:31:20,773 --> 00:31:25,773
It comes in large, extra
large and extra, extra large.

491
00:31:28,213 --> 00:31:33,213
I've tried kegel exercises,
rejuvenation cream.

492
00:31:34,303 --> 00:31:35,986
It's not working.

493
00:31:36,936 --> 00:31:39,523
I really think I need some
tightening up down there.

494
00:31:39,523 --> 00:31:44,523
Um, though, I'm kind of
worried about sensitivity.

495
00:31:44,833 --> 00:31:47,293
I was reading that some women

496
00:31:47,293 --> 00:31:50,113
tend to lose some
sensation in their breasts.

497
00:31:50,113 --> 00:31:52,513
I assure you that there
won't be any numbness.

498
00:31:53,893 --> 00:31:55,872
You know, my surgeries have more to do

499
00:31:55,872 --> 00:31:58,183
with manipulating blood, flow.

500
00:31:58,183 --> 00:31:59,903
Will it still function normally

501
00:32:00,842 --> 00:32:03,073
even if I got the extra, extra large?

502
00:32:03,073 --> 00:32:04,762
Yes, yes.

503
00:32:04,762 --> 00:32:05,901
I mean, look,

504
00:32:05,901 --> 00:32:07,693
I'm just gonna make a small incision

505
00:32:07,693 --> 00:32:09,743
at the base of the abdomen

506
00:32:11,412 --> 00:32:13,712
and then I'm gonna insert
the silicon cylinder

507
00:32:14,581 --> 00:32:18,553
in the shaft at the top so it
won't obstruct the passages.

508
00:32:18,553 --> 00:32:20,213
As a matter of fact,

509
00:32:20,213 --> 00:32:22,491
my procedures will increase the flow

510
00:32:22,491 --> 00:32:25,165
and it will help you maintain stronger,

511
00:32:25,165 --> 00:32:27,016
longer, and harder erections.

512
00:32:28,153 --> 00:32:30,196
I always wanted a bionic dick.

513
00:32:31,423 --> 00:32:34,096
Gentlemen, we can rebuild them.

514
00:32:35,263 --> 00:32:37,003
We have the technology.

515
00:32:37,003 --> 00:32:40,756
We can make 'em better, stronger, faster.

516
00:32:48,013 --> 00:32:49,713
Healthy three to four inches, Doc.

517
00:32:51,123 --> 00:32:52,789
Most women already think I'm a dick,

518
00:32:52,789 --> 00:32:54,253
might as well be a big one, right?

519
00:32:54,253 --> 00:32:57,103
Wow, I have nothing to lose.

520
00:32:57,103 --> 00:32:59,853
No, no, it's just a matter
of what you're gonna gain.

521
00:33:00,853 --> 00:33:01,907
I like that.

522
00:33:01,907 --> 00:33:03,207
I'm gonna sign right here.

523
00:33:04,843 --> 00:33:08,473
Oh, any chance you
could bleach my asshole

524
00:33:08,473 --> 00:33:09,643
while you're down there?

525
00:33:09,643 --> 00:33:11,506
All the porn stars are doing it.

526
00:33:12,703 --> 00:33:14,713
It's been a slow week.

527
00:33:14,713 --> 00:33:17,713
Nobody seems to buy books here anymore.

528
00:33:17,713 --> 00:33:19,183
I actually make more

529
00:33:19,183 --> 00:33:22,789
by sending people to
Dr. Pavor's as clients.

530
00:33:26,023 --> 00:33:27,583
What the hell, buddy?

531
00:33:27,583 --> 00:33:29,653
You're open rather late, aren't you?

532
00:33:29,653 --> 00:33:30,826
So what is it to you?

533
00:33:32,353 --> 00:33:33,603
I'm looking for a girl.

534
00:33:34,742 --> 00:33:36,473
Keep it in your pants, man.

535
00:33:36,473 --> 00:33:37,513
I just sell books here.

536
00:33:37,513 --> 00:33:40,333
Her name is Faye, she's missing.

537
00:33:40,333 --> 00:33:42,433
I know she came through here last week.

538
00:33:42,433 --> 00:33:44,053
So what?

539
00:33:44,053 --> 00:33:46,303
I get a lot of people
that come through here.

540
00:33:48,583 --> 00:33:49,416
You do?

541
00:33:50,750 --> 00:33:52,067
I can't help you.

542
00:33:52,067 --> 00:33:53,317
Get outta here.

543
00:34:03,403 --> 00:34:07,393
I know 42 ways I can injure
you to the point of death

544
00:34:07,393 --> 00:34:08,806
and all you'll feel is pain.

545
00:34:10,033 --> 00:34:14,656
You'll beg me for death,
but I'll just hurt you more.

546
00:34:16,160 --> 00:34:16,993
Okay, geez.

547
00:34:19,116 --> 00:34:19,949
Now,

548
00:34:22,483 --> 00:34:23,316
this girl.

549
00:34:24,988 --> 00:34:25,821
We'll try this once again.

550
00:34:26,738 --> 00:34:27,571
Was she in here recently?

551
00:34:28,612 --> 00:34:29,712
I have not seen her.

552
00:34:32,707 --> 00:34:33,606
See if this helps you remember.

553
00:34:34,490 --> 00:34:35,323
Ow!

554
00:34:35,323 --> 00:34:37,282
Okay, okay, okay, okay, stop, stop.

555
00:34:37,282 --> 00:34:40,273
Yes, yes, she was here a few days ago.

556
00:34:40,273 --> 00:34:43,731
See, now that wasn't so hard, was it?

557
00:34:47,113 --> 00:34:47,946
Yeah.

558
00:34:49,692 --> 00:34:50,864
No, it's me.

559
00:34:50,864 --> 00:34:52,346
No, I'm here right now.

560
00:34:56,289 --> 00:34:58,837
The pen is mightier than the sword,

561
00:34:58,837 --> 00:34:59,946
when it's a poison pen.

562
00:35:33,277 --> 00:35:34,303
That room is off limits.

563
00:35:34,303 --> 00:35:38,713
Sorry, I um, thought
I heard someone crying.

564
00:35:38,713 --> 00:35:41,716
Do you think you're
the only patient here?

565
00:35:41,716 --> 00:35:43,163
This is a painful recovery process

566
00:35:43,163 --> 00:35:45,043
and you need to respect
the privacy of others.

567
00:35:45,043 --> 00:35:46,457
Of course.

568
00:35:46,457 --> 00:35:47,353
I, I'm sorry.

569
00:35:47,353 --> 00:35:48,991
Your friends should be done

570
00:35:48,991 --> 00:35:50,270
with their consultation by now.

571
00:35:50,270 --> 00:35:51,666
I'm sure you can find
them in the kitchen area.

572
00:35:52,573 --> 00:35:53,406
No worries.

573
00:36:10,288 --> 00:36:11,563
What are you doing, Anna?

574
00:36:11,563 --> 00:36:14,653
I don't answer to human cows.

575
00:36:14,653 --> 00:36:16,156
I won't be human for long.

576
00:36:17,113 --> 00:36:18,776
Oh yeah?

577
00:36:18,776 --> 00:36:20,743
Dr. Pavor needs somebody
to go out into daylight.

578
00:36:20,743 --> 00:36:22,513
Now what did you do with Brenda?

579
00:36:22,513 --> 00:36:23,563
I took care of her.

580
00:36:24,508 --> 00:36:25,543
The wolf will do the rest.

581
00:36:25,543 --> 00:36:26,836
Huh, leave now.

582
00:36:28,333 --> 00:36:29,166
Why?

583
00:36:29,166 --> 00:36:31,783
You think because Dr. Pavor
drinks you, he trusts you?

584
00:36:32,630 --> 00:36:34,426
No, he trusts me.

585
00:36:35,377 --> 00:36:38,135
You are the only one he punish
with that ridiculous face.

586
00:36:43,773 --> 00:36:45,440
Anna, is that you?

587
00:36:47,053 --> 00:36:48,613
Please, untie me.

588
00:36:48,613 --> 00:36:49,726
No one will know.

589
00:36:52,981 --> 00:36:53,814
What, what are you doing?

590
00:36:54,856 --> 00:36:56,443
I'm thirsty.

591
00:36:56,443 --> 00:36:57,276
Ah!

592
00:36:57,276 --> 00:36:58,473
And if I were you, I'd, shh!

593
00:36:59,563 --> 00:37:01,393
Have you been drinking blood again?

594
00:37:01,393 --> 00:37:04,924
What are you gonna do, report
me to Vampire's Anonymous?

595
00:37:33,133 --> 00:37:34,183
Back off.

596
00:37:34,183 --> 00:37:35,016
Who are you?

597
00:37:35,919 --> 00:37:36,752
I'm the owner.

598
00:37:36,752 --> 00:37:37,903
I'm a detective.

599
00:37:37,903 --> 00:37:39,839
I just need some answers.

600
00:37:39,839 --> 00:37:40,672
Why the gun?

601
00:37:40,672 --> 00:37:42,493
Seems to make a strong point.

602
00:37:42,493 --> 00:37:43,576
I'm warning you,

603
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:46,032
the cops down here will not care

604
00:37:46,032 --> 00:37:46,993
if you're a big shot detective.

605
00:37:46,993 --> 00:37:49,633
Why you uh, have a lot of books here.

606
00:37:49,633 --> 00:37:50,483
Sell any of them?

607
00:37:51,343 --> 00:37:52,816
That's your question?

608
00:37:53,750 --> 00:37:55,092
You wanna know about my books?

609
00:37:55,092 --> 00:37:55,925
Yeah.

610
00:37:55,925 --> 00:37:57,387
And what are you doing here in the dark?

611
00:37:57,387 --> 00:37:58,220
It's none of your business.

612
00:37:58,220 --> 00:37:59,473
It is my business.

613
00:37:59,473 --> 00:38:01,798
Geez, take it easy.

614
00:38:01,798 --> 00:38:02,653
You don't have to point that thing at me.

615
00:38:02,653 --> 00:38:04,813
I'm looking for a
young woman, name's Faye.

616
00:38:04,813 --> 00:38:06,823
She was here sometime last week.

617
00:38:06,823 --> 00:38:07,783
Did you see her?

618
00:38:07,783 --> 00:38:09,703
I don't know who she is.

619
00:38:09,703 --> 00:38:11,236
Here take a look.

620
00:38:12,223 --> 00:38:14,678
Wow, what a looker.

621
00:38:14,678 --> 00:38:15,765
That's my daughter!

622
00:38:15,765 --> 00:38:16,993
I never saw her.

623
00:38:16,993 --> 00:38:18,463
Did a man named Steve come here tonight?

624
00:38:18,463 --> 00:38:20,538
No, nobody was here.

625
00:38:20,538 --> 00:38:21,371
Can you please leave?

626
00:38:21,371 --> 00:38:23,083
Listen dick face,

627
00:38:23,083 --> 00:38:24,373
I know this place is up front

628
00:38:24,373 --> 00:38:25,933
for a shady plastic surgery center

629
00:38:25,933 --> 00:38:27,991
somewhere south of the border

630
00:38:27,991 --> 00:38:28,933
and the clients come here first.

631
00:38:28,933 --> 00:38:30,313
Let me ask you again.

632
00:38:30,313 --> 00:38:31,513
Have you seen my daughter?

633
00:38:31,513 --> 00:38:33,716
Come on, that sounds ridiculous.

634
00:38:34,646 --> 00:38:35,653
Oh!

635
00:38:35,653 --> 00:38:38,653
Oh man, that wasn't cool, man.

636
00:38:38,653 --> 00:38:40,123
You think I'm joking?

637
00:38:40,123 --> 00:38:42,156
One more lie and I'm gonna
shoot you in the leg.

638
00:38:43,063 --> 00:38:46,165
Yes, uh, they, they were here.

639
00:38:46,165 --> 00:38:48,175
They were here a few days ago, but all,

640
00:38:48,175 --> 00:38:49,243
all I did was draw them a map.

641
00:38:49,243 --> 00:38:50,076
What map?

642
00:38:51,209 --> 00:38:53,413
Uh, this map.

643
00:38:53,413 --> 00:38:54,246
Hand it to me.

644
00:38:55,453 --> 00:38:56,286
Hey, hey.

645
00:38:58,753 --> 00:38:59,743
That was stupid.

646
00:38:59,743 --> 00:39:01,633
Now you're gonna have
to draw me another map.

647
00:39:01,633 --> 00:39:04,133
Come on, we both know
you're not gonna shoot me.

648
00:39:05,717 --> 00:39:06,823
Are you testing me?

649
00:39:06,823 --> 00:39:08,566
Okay, I'll draw you a new map.

650
00:39:10,423 --> 00:39:13,456
But I need to get my
special pens over there.

651
00:39:14,674 --> 00:39:15,547
What?

652
00:39:15,547 --> 00:39:16,424
I gotta get my special pen.'

653
00:39:16,424 --> 00:39:18,543
Hey, back off.

654
00:39:18,543 --> 00:39:19,734
I'll get it.

655
00:39:31,590 --> 00:39:33,007
You killed Steve.

656
00:39:34,037 --> 00:39:35,263
Last chance, where's my daughter?

657
00:39:35,263 --> 00:39:37,903
Look, I will draw you a new map,

658
00:39:37,903 --> 00:39:39,976
but I know you're not gonna shoot me.

659
00:39:55,363 --> 00:39:59,026
You're right, I didn't
shoot you, asshole.

660
00:40:01,945 --> 00:40:03,345
So, how'd it go?

661
00:40:03,345 --> 00:40:04,233
Great.

662
00:40:04,233 --> 00:40:06,196
I'm going to spread my
legs for the doc tomorrow.

663
00:40:06,196 --> 00:40:07,162
So what's new?

664
00:40:07,162 --> 00:40:07,995
Shut up.

665
00:40:07,995 --> 00:40:08,945
You're spreading, too.

666
00:40:08,945 --> 00:40:11,263
Yeah, you're finally
gonna grow to be a big boy.

667
00:40:11,263 --> 00:40:12,373
Where's Sky?

668
00:40:12,373 --> 00:40:15,021
Oh, she's upstairs unpacking.

669
00:40:15,021 --> 00:40:16,304
You guys are sharing a room.

670
00:40:16,304 --> 00:40:17,376
They have Quinn and me bunking together.

671
00:40:20,642 --> 00:40:22,843
What did you guys
think about those nurses?

672
00:40:22,843 --> 00:40:23,676
I'd do 'em.

673
00:40:24,654 --> 00:40:25,487
Me too.

674
00:40:25,487 --> 00:40:27,613
As long as I got my
standard girl/girl rate.

675
00:40:27,613 --> 00:40:31,156
But like what's with the
naughty nurse uniforms?

676
00:40:32,542 --> 00:40:35,416
My perv radar says
it's all about Dr. Pavor,

677
00:40:36,383 --> 00:40:37,606
but who cares?

678
00:40:38,464 --> 00:40:39,986
As long as the rate isn't even a 10th

679
00:40:39,986 --> 00:40:41,016
of what it'd be in Beverly Hills?

680
00:40:41,943 --> 00:40:42,943
Yeah, I don't think
we should judge them.

681
00:40:42,943 --> 00:40:46,082
They're professionals,
they deserve our respect.

682
00:40:46,082 --> 00:40:48,420
Wait, so you're saying
you wouldn't do 'em?

683
00:40:48,420 --> 00:40:50,056
No, I, I didn't say that.

684
00:40:52,035 --> 00:40:53,085
It's just, nevermind.

685
00:40:54,323 --> 00:40:56,269
I think we should all get some rest.

686
00:40:56,269 --> 00:40:58,686
We all have a big day
tomorrow, and I do mean big.

687
00:41:00,115 --> 00:41:02,544
So what time do you go under the knife?

688
00:41:02,544 --> 00:41:04,179
He's doing me at noon.

689
00:41:04,179 --> 00:41:06,579
10:30, and can you
please not put it that way?

690
00:41:07,487 --> 00:41:10,633
Why are you getting scared stiff?

691
00:41:10,633 --> 00:41:13,036
Actually, just the opposite.

692
00:41:14,113 --> 00:41:16,456
Good, then I will
get some sleep tonight.

693
00:41:31,693 --> 00:41:32,803
Oh, there you are.

694
00:41:32,803 --> 00:41:35,006
I was wondering where you were.

695
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:38,473
Yeah, just checking out this
place, this surgery center.

696
00:41:38,473 --> 00:41:41,476
Oh, I was sure that you were somewhere

697
00:41:41,476 --> 00:41:44,323
hitting on Miss Face Paint Nurse.

698
00:41:44,323 --> 00:41:46,816
She's kind of hot, for a mime.

699
00:41:47,883 --> 00:41:51,103
I think I scared her off, so.

700
00:41:51,103 --> 00:41:52,783
Oh no.

701
00:41:52,783 --> 00:41:56,326
You didn't tell her about your
sexy tune obsession, did you?

702
00:41:58,681 --> 00:42:01,017
You know that's fucking weird, right?

703
00:42:01,017 --> 00:42:01,963
Okay, I screwed up.

704
00:42:01,963 --> 00:42:02,836
Drop it.

705
00:42:06,883 --> 00:42:09,486
So do you think your
boobs are in good hands?

706
00:42:09,486 --> 00:42:10,386
Well, we'll see.

707
00:42:12,427 --> 00:42:13,260
The procedure's tomorrow at 9:00 AM.

708
00:42:13,260 --> 00:42:15,793
Damn, he's doing all three
of you in the same day?

709
00:42:15,793 --> 00:42:17,383
Yeah.

710
00:42:17,383 --> 00:42:20,450
The way Dr. Pavor explains it

711
00:42:20,450 --> 00:42:22,993
is that he doesn't actually
have to insert any implants.

712
00:42:22,993 --> 00:42:25,546
It's more about channeling the blood flow,

713
00:42:26,501 --> 00:42:27,523
so the surgery goes by quick.

714
00:42:27,523 --> 00:42:29,113
What?

715
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:30,193
He compared it to,

716
00:42:30,193 --> 00:42:31,633
you know when a woman's breasts

717
00:42:31,633 --> 00:42:35,143
fill up with milk after pregnancy?

718
00:42:35,143 --> 00:42:36,193
Something like that.

719
00:42:36,193 --> 00:42:37,763
Hey, whatever.

720
00:42:37,763 --> 00:42:39,233
If it works, you know?

721
00:42:39,233 --> 00:42:41,376
You don't think that sounds
like a little dangerous?

722
00:42:42,493 --> 00:42:44,266
No, I trust him.

723
00:42:45,376 --> 00:42:47,494
Plus he said that it's gonna go by quick

724
00:42:47,494 --> 00:42:49,236
and that they're gonna
look really natural.

725
00:42:50,206 --> 00:42:51,433
Tell you the truth, I can't wait.

726
00:42:51,433 --> 00:42:53,783
Whatever, I think all
three of you are crazy.

727
00:42:54,722 --> 00:42:56,470
You are fine just the way you are.

728
00:42:56,470 --> 00:42:58,573
Well fine is not perfect.

729
00:42:58,573 --> 00:43:00,643
Nobody is perfect.

730
00:43:00,643 --> 00:43:03,283
And that is why we are here.

731
00:43:03,283 --> 00:43:06,414
What has Pavor told you
about drinking the product

732
00:43:06,414 --> 00:43:07,414
time and time again?

733
00:43:08,427 --> 00:43:09,936
Do you remember what he
did to you last time?

734
00:43:12,103 --> 00:43:13,906
No thanks.

735
00:43:13,906 --> 00:43:16,356
I don't want white mime
paint burning to my face.

736
00:43:28,395 --> 00:43:29,526
Dr. Pavor, are you okay?

737
00:43:30,523 --> 00:43:32,926
Just need a little nourishment.

738
00:43:35,203 --> 00:43:36,853
What's going on there?

739
00:43:36,853 --> 00:43:39,003
Anna was dipping into
the supplies again.

740
00:43:40,107 --> 00:43:41,065
You fool.

741
00:43:41,065 --> 00:43:42,786
You know that I need
my stress for tomorrow.

742
00:43:45,523 --> 00:43:48,676
If I pump out anymore
from her, she will die.

743
00:43:50,443 --> 00:43:52,963
What about the girl who
is not here for surgery?

744
00:43:52,963 --> 00:43:55,333
She was snooping around earlier.

745
00:43:55,333 --> 00:43:57,518
I bet you can fit on her tonight.

746
00:43:57,518 --> 00:43:59,263
No, I had other plans for her.

747
00:43:59,263 --> 00:44:00,553
Oh, she reminds me of-

748
00:44:00,553 --> 00:44:02,053
No!

749
00:44:02,053 --> 00:44:03,946
Thanks to your indiscretion,

750
00:44:04,783 --> 00:44:07,393
I now must go out tonight.

751
00:44:07,393 --> 00:44:08,226
You know,

752
00:44:08,226 --> 00:44:10,723
I really hope Bobby
appreciates what you're doing.

753
00:44:10,723 --> 00:44:13,130
I'm not doing this for Bobby.

754
00:44:13,130 --> 00:44:14,230
I'm doing this for me.

755
00:44:15,193 --> 00:44:19,933
Hey, why don't you get
something done while we're here?

756
00:44:19,933 --> 00:44:23,596
Like what, longer legs, a butt tuck?

757
00:44:24,616 --> 00:44:27,343
I mean, hey, if you can't
bounce a quarter off it, right?

758
00:44:27,343 --> 00:44:28,336
Fuck you.

759
00:44:29,533 --> 00:44:31,483
What about that tattoo that you hate?

760
00:44:32,533 --> 00:44:33,613
I'll pay to get it removed.

761
00:44:33,613 --> 00:44:35,833
My gift to you for coming with us.

762
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,899
That's what friends do.

763
00:44:37,899 --> 00:44:38,826
They support each other

764
00:44:38,826 --> 00:44:40,146
through dumb decisions like this one.

765
00:44:41,120 --> 00:44:42,703
Do you have something against Dr. Pavor?

766
00:44:42,703 --> 00:44:44,689
I've never even met him.

767
00:44:44,689 --> 00:44:45,553
I have nothing against him.

768
00:44:45,553 --> 00:44:48,343
Okay, I know maybe
he won't be your type,

769
00:44:48,343 --> 00:44:49,726
but I don't know.

770
00:44:50,673 --> 00:44:52,526
There's something really
comforting about him.

771
00:44:52,526 --> 00:44:54,545
He reminds me of my grandfather.

772
00:44:54,545 --> 00:44:56,086
Sounds dreamy.

773
00:44:56,086 --> 00:44:57,976
Madeline, it is you.

774
00:44:59,563 --> 00:45:04,366
You'll come back, soon, soon.

775
00:45:05,233 --> 00:45:06,406
But now I must feed.

776
00:45:17,953 --> 00:45:20,132
Beautiful weather, right?

777
00:45:20,132 --> 00:45:21,373
Lovely.

778
00:45:21,373 --> 00:45:23,581
I'm glad you liked dinner.

779
00:45:23,581 --> 00:45:26,050
I did not realize that
you were such a good cook.

780
00:45:26,050 --> 00:45:27,496
You really surprised me.

781
00:45:29,160 --> 00:45:30,370
I'm gonna show you something special.

782
00:45:30,370 --> 00:45:31,633
Check this out.

783
00:45:31,633 --> 00:45:32,716
It's a tree.

784
00:45:33,913 --> 00:45:35,983
Yeah, it's a pomegranate tree.

785
00:45:35,983 --> 00:45:37,433
I grew it from a single seed.

786
00:45:38,743 --> 00:45:42,106
Wow, you're a cook and a gardener?

787
00:45:43,783 --> 00:45:46,366
Well you, you're very beautiful.

788
00:45:47,263 --> 00:45:49,726
Wait, wait, it's barely our first date.

789
00:45:52,814 --> 00:45:53,731
Come on.

790
00:45:54,593 --> 00:45:56,393
You know you like me and I like you.

791
00:46:15,123 --> 00:46:15,956
I don't get it.

792
00:46:15,956 --> 00:46:17,983
How do I make my fangs show?

793
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,883
I just think about something
that makes me really angry.

794
00:46:21,718 --> 00:46:23,136
I usually think about my father.

795
00:46:28,393 --> 00:46:29,293
That's it.

796
00:46:29,293 --> 00:46:30,913
What did you think about?

797
00:46:30,913 --> 00:46:34,215
How hard it is to get
a long-term relationship?

798
00:46:34,215 --> 00:46:35,858
That makes me mad.

799
00:46:35,858 --> 00:46:36,691
Well, maybe you wanna rethink

800
00:46:36,691 --> 00:46:38,513
that whole long-term relationship thing

801
00:46:39,349 --> 00:46:41,173
because vampires live a long time.

802
00:46:41,173 --> 00:46:43,156
Can I crash here for a while?

803
00:46:44,203 --> 00:46:46,299
No, that wouldn't be a good idea.

804
00:46:46,299 --> 00:46:48,292
My boss is really grumpy.

805
00:46:48,292 --> 00:46:49,290
He's very persnickety.

806
00:46:49,290 --> 00:46:50,233
In fact, you should leave now.

807
00:46:50,233 --> 00:46:52,663
I wanna stay a while.

808
00:46:52,663 --> 00:46:55,213
We had so much fun last night.

809
00:46:55,213 --> 00:46:57,845
We did have fun, but I have work to do,

810
00:46:57,845 --> 00:46:59,395
so now it's time for you to go.

811
00:47:00,402 --> 00:47:03,095
Are you sure it's okay
if I leave in the daylight?

812
00:47:03,095 --> 00:47:03,972
Of course you can.

813
00:47:03,972 --> 00:47:05,055
That's just a myth.

814
00:47:05,055 --> 00:47:07,295
Vampires can totally
go out in the daylight.

815
00:47:07,295 --> 00:47:08,473
Well, what about the other myths?

816
00:47:08,473 --> 00:47:10,693
Well, the other myths are mostly true.

817
00:47:10,693 --> 00:47:14,323
Well, I wanna see my
fangs in my reflection.

818
00:47:14,323 --> 00:47:17,750
No, you absolutely cannot
look at yourself in the mirror.

819
00:47:17,750 --> 00:47:21,223
That myth is true, but I
assure you, you look very sexy.

820
00:47:21,223 --> 00:47:23,083
Come on, trust me.

821
00:47:23,083 --> 00:47:26,773
Well, okay, I'll trust
you since you're my maker.

822
00:47:26,773 --> 00:47:29,946
Okay, well, it's time for you to leave.

823
00:47:31,222 --> 00:47:34,123
Are you sure I can leave
though without any problems?

824
00:47:34,123 --> 00:47:35,100
Of course.

825
00:47:37,365 --> 00:47:38,198
Okay.

826
00:47:56,263 --> 00:47:57,166
Too clingy.

827
00:47:58,993 --> 00:48:00,043
You know, Maddie,

828
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:02,233
this is your chance to talk to Dr. Pavor

829
00:48:02,233 --> 00:48:05,053
in case you want anything done.

830
00:48:05,053 --> 00:48:06,615
Last chance.

831
00:48:06,615 --> 00:48:08,746
You sure you still wanna
go through with this?

832
00:48:08,746 --> 00:48:10,633
Damn, Maddie, you gotta
stop asking me that.

833
00:48:10,633 --> 00:48:11,926
I know.

834
00:48:11,926 --> 00:48:13,666
Well, sorry, I'm nervous.

835
00:48:15,302 --> 00:48:18,013
I'm so sorry to keep you both waiting.

836
00:48:18,013 --> 00:48:18,846
Okay.

837
00:48:20,983 --> 00:48:24,376
Dr. Pavor, you look different.

838
00:48:25,311 --> 00:48:26,186
Well,

839
00:48:26,186 --> 00:48:28,116
it's amazing what a good
night's sleep can do to you.

840
00:48:29,617 --> 00:48:32,211
How did you sleep yesterday, my dear?

841
00:48:32,211 --> 00:48:33,111
Good, very good.

842
00:48:34,003 --> 00:48:35,603
Maddie's a nervous wreck though.

843
00:48:37,363 --> 00:48:40,216
So you are the one
here for moral support.

844
00:48:41,365 --> 00:48:42,198
Mm-hm.

845
00:48:42,198 --> 00:48:44,836
Too many morals though,
not enough support.

846
00:48:46,483 --> 00:48:47,806
My name's Madison.

847
00:48:49,513 --> 00:48:51,030
I am Dr. Pavor.

848
00:48:55,794 --> 00:48:58,754
Doesn't Pavor mean dread in Spanish?

849
00:48:58,754 --> 00:48:59,587
Very good.

850
00:48:59,587 --> 00:49:01,633
But there's nothing to
dread in here, my dear.

851
00:49:02,899 --> 00:49:04,153
I told you.

852
00:49:04,153 --> 00:49:07,183
Are, are you from Mexico, Dr. Pavor?

853
00:49:07,183 --> 00:49:09,883
Oh, my family's from
California, you know,

854
00:49:09,883 --> 00:49:12,315
tracing back many years,

855
00:49:12,315 --> 00:49:16,753
but now I call this
beautiful country my home.

856
00:49:19,633 --> 00:49:21,586
You're really striking, my dear.

857
00:49:23,143 --> 00:49:24,733
See, even the doctor

858
00:49:24,733 --> 00:49:27,544
doesn't think I need
to have any work done.

859
00:49:27,544 --> 00:49:28,377
Well, I didn't say that.

860
00:49:28,377 --> 00:49:30,256
You know, improvements can always be made.

861
00:49:31,183 --> 00:49:35,383
I bet, but, but I'm,
I'm cool the way I am.

862
00:49:35,383 --> 00:49:36,973
Except for that tattoo.

863
00:49:36,973 --> 00:49:41,476
Oh, tattoo removal is a little
beneath my skill, you know?

864
00:49:42,349 --> 00:49:44,446
But after I finish with your friends,

865
00:49:45,313 --> 00:49:49,050
I will be more than happy to
touch you up, free of charge.

866
00:49:50,443 --> 00:49:52,576
Well, but first things first.

867
00:49:54,163 --> 00:49:56,386
Are you ready to become voluptuous?

868
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,903
Yes, I am.

869
00:49:58,903 --> 00:50:02,388
These twins have been
just waiting to grow up.

870
00:50:48,722 --> 00:50:49,555
Hey!

871
00:50:51,313 --> 00:50:52,336
Hey buddy, stop!

872
00:50:54,128 --> 00:50:55,201
Stop!

873
00:51:06,433 --> 00:51:07,756
Hey, thanks for stopping.

874
00:51:08,590 --> 00:51:10,115
I could use a little help here.

875
00:51:10,115 --> 00:51:10,948
I'm looking for this surgery center

876
00:51:10,948 --> 00:51:14,176
and just got this crappy little
map and no cell reception.

877
00:51:16,034 --> 00:51:16,986
Can you tell me where the clinic is?

878
00:51:18,114 --> 00:51:19,330
Where'd you get that map?

879
00:51:20,882 --> 00:51:21,715
Why?

880
00:51:22,837 --> 00:51:23,916
So you're the one that killed Tony?

881
00:51:25,744 --> 00:51:27,163
So you know Tony?

882
00:51:27,163 --> 00:51:28,956
You know, he killed my friend, Steve.

883
00:51:30,080 --> 00:51:31,132
And then he tore up this map.

884
00:51:31,132 --> 00:51:33,181
This is all I got.

885
00:51:33,181 --> 00:51:35,080
So how do I get to this clinic?

886
00:51:35,080 --> 00:51:38,503
You know, I suggest that you
turn around now, head home.

887
00:51:38,503 --> 00:51:40,723
Otherwise, you're a dead man.

888
00:51:40,723 --> 00:51:42,373
I'm not going anywhere.

889
00:51:42,373 --> 00:51:43,963
How do you know Tony?

890
00:51:43,963 --> 00:51:46,290
We work for the same employer.

891
00:51:46,290 --> 00:51:47,123
Yeah?

892
00:51:47,123 --> 00:51:48,194
Yeah, who's that?

893
00:51:48,194 --> 00:51:49,944
You don't know?

894
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:52,273
Come on, who is it?

895
00:51:52,273 --> 00:51:53,692
The cartel.

896
00:51:53,692 --> 00:51:54,525
Cartel?

897
00:51:56,263 --> 00:51:58,183
Can't have to do with drugs.

898
00:51:58,183 --> 00:52:00,078
What's really going on here?

899
00:52:00,078 --> 00:52:02,796
Cartel doesn't want anybody
to mess with the doctors,

900
00:52:04,316 --> 00:52:07,606
so either you leave alive or in a box.

901
00:52:08,548 --> 00:52:09,381
Your choice.

902
00:52:09,381 --> 00:52:11,694
Faye's not doing anything with drugs.

903
00:52:11,694 --> 00:52:13,273
What does the cartel out with my daughter?

904
00:52:13,273 --> 00:52:14,845
You know what?

905
00:52:14,845 --> 00:52:15,747
I'm tired of this shit.

906
00:52:15,747 --> 00:52:17,146
On your knees now.

907
00:52:18,610 --> 00:52:19,443
Hey, hey.

908
00:52:19,443 --> 00:52:20,563
On your knees!

909
00:52:20,563 --> 00:52:22,456
On your knees.

910
00:52:24,305 --> 00:52:25,453
She's my only kid, all right?

911
00:52:25,453 --> 00:52:27,756
Hey, my ex is gonna kill me
if I don't bring her back.

912
00:52:29,297 --> 00:52:30,223
Huh, you got kids?

913
00:52:30,223 --> 00:52:32,843
Oh, I'm tired of
listening to your bullshit.

914
00:52:32,843 --> 00:52:33,786
Say your prayers.

915
00:52:33,786 --> 00:52:34,619
Listen, can you,

916
00:52:34,619 --> 00:52:37,563
can you at least point me
in the right direction so I,

917
00:52:38,406 --> 00:52:39,911
I know I was close to her, please?

918
00:52:39,911 --> 00:52:41,323
"The right direction."

919
00:52:41,323 --> 00:52:43,123
You have no idea how close you were.

920
00:52:44,168 --> 00:52:45,868
It was right over there, that way.

921
00:52:54,296 --> 00:52:56,518
Let us begin.

922
00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:58,265
Aren't you gonna gimme anesthetic?

923
00:52:58,265 --> 00:53:02,296
No, something better.

924
00:53:02,296 --> 00:53:03,402
What is it?

925
00:53:03,402 --> 00:53:04,956
Oh, it's a special cocktail.

926
00:53:05,899 --> 00:53:06,732
Just drink it and look into my eyes.

927
00:53:10,626 --> 00:53:11,709
Let us begin.

928
00:53:17,249 --> 00:53:19,960
You, you want me to drink this?

929
00:53:19,960 --> 00:53:22,946
It's just
a special cocktail.

930
00:53:22,946 --> 00:53:25,946
Just drink it and look into my eyes.

931
00:53:29,200 --> 00:53:30,283
Let us begin.

932
00:53:34,057 --> 00:53:35,173
It's a special cocktail.

933
00:53:35,173 --> 00:53:37,036
Just drink it and look into my eyes.

934
00:53:44,023 --> 00:53:46,303
Reading up on your bartending?

935
00:53:46,303 --> 00:53:47,836
Your surgery's done already?

936
00:53:50,563 --> 00:53:51,396
What do you think?

937
00:53:53,623 --> 00:53:54,616
Shit, Sky, um,

938
00:53:57,043 --> 00:54:00,955
do you remember what you told
me your worst nightmare is?

939
00:54:05,363 --> 00:54:06,646
Okay, let's see it.

940
00:54:07,873 --> 00:54:08,888
Yeah, whip it out.

941
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:10,573
Just a little peek though, okay?

942
00:54:10,573 --> 00:54:12,786
All right, but you
ladies better stand back.

943
00:54:14,053 --> 00:54:15,106
Where is it?

944
00:54:16,056 --> 00:54:17,872
Oh my God, there's nothing there.

945
00:54:17,872 --> 00:54:19,972
He turned you into a mannequin.

946
00:54:24,853 --> 00:54:25,726
Is, is it over?

947
00:54:26,745 --> 00:54:27,973
Am I okay?

948
00:54:27,973 --> 00:54:30,553
Almost,
but I need you to push.

949
00:54:31,999 --> 00:54:33,697
Really push harder.

950
00:54:33,697 --> 00:54:34,530
Why?

951
00:54:35,775 --> 00:54:37,525
What the fuck, I'm pregnant?

952
00:54:37,525 --> 00:54:39,801
Yes, and the
baby's trying to come out,

953
00:54:39,801 --> 00:54:41,799
so I want you to push, like really push.

954
00:54:43,753 --> 00:54:44,836
There's a problem.

955
00:54:45,877 --> 00:54:49,149
I tied the bandana too much
and the baby can't come out.

956
00:54:49,149 --> 00:54:50,152
Really push harder.

957
00:54:50,152 --> 00:54:50,985
- I don't understand.
- Push!

958
00:54:53,556 --> 00:54:54,723
Push!
Oh God.

959
00:54:55,655 --> 00:54:57,252
What is it?
Push!

960
00:54:57,252 --> 00:54:59,314
- What's inside of me?
- Push!

961
00:55:03,486 --> 00:55:04,726
Welcome back.

962
00:55:06,283 --> 00:55:07,903
Nice nap?

963
00:55:07,903 --> 00:55:09,313
What happened?

964
00:55:09,313 --> 00:55:10,146
We're done.

965
00:55:11,319 --> 00:55:12,152
Was there a problem?

966
00:55:12,152 --> 00:55:13,066
None whatsoever.

967
00:55:13,903 --> 00:55:17,146
You just need to rest so your
body will accept the changes.

968
00:55:18,143 --> 00:55:19,873
I dreamt I was having a baby.

969
00:55:19,873 --> 00:55:22,696
It was really the
opposite of having a baby.

970
00:55:25,489 --> 00:55:26,322
Sky.

971
00:55:27,701 --> 00:55:32,701
Sky.

972
00:55:46,667 --> 00:55:48,959
Is anyone gonna get the door?

973
00:55:55,119 --> 00:55:56,455
Who are you?

974
00:55:56,455 --> 00:55:59,292
I, I'm, I'm a friend of
a patient of Dr. Pavor.

975
00:55:59,292 --> 00:56:00,795
Oh my God, what happened?

976
00:56:00,795 --> 00:56:02,323
I, I need to talk to
Dr. Pavor right away.

977
00:56:02,323 --> 00:56:04,155
It's an emergency.

978
00:56:04,155 --> 00:56:05,053
Dr. Pavor!

979
00:56:05,053 --> 00:56:06,696
Oh my God, Dr. Pavor!

980
00:56:07,692 --> 00:56:08,525
What's all the commotion?

981
00:56:08,525 --> 00:56:09,976
Oh, close the god damn door.

982
00:56:11,113 --> 00:56:12,883
What are you doing here?

983
00:56:12,883 --> 00:56:14,326
We got a serious problem.

984
00:56:15,380 --> 00:56:17,691
Hey, Maria Angela,
help Mr. Smites back in,

985
00:56:17,691 --> 00:56:18,733
into the operating room,

986
00:56:18,733 --> 00:56:21,839
and can you assist your
friend back into her room

987
00:56:21,839 --> 00:56:23,316
because her body needs to rest.

988
00:56:32,803 --> 00:56:34,486
That was strange.

989
00:56:35,451 --> 00:56:36,583
Yeah.

990
00:56:36,583 --> 00:56:37,426
How'd it go?

991
00:56:38,268 --> 00:56:39,253
Are you okay?

992
00:56:39,253 --> 00:56:40,996
Yeah, I, I think so.

993
00:56:41,841 --> 00:56:45,243
I just feel very, very...

994
00:56:47,713 --> 00:56:48,676
Is it worth it?

995
00:56:49,573 --> 00:56:50,746
Guys like it tight.

996
00:56:51,673 --> 00:56:53,746
Plus, I don't plan to do porn forever.

997
00:56:55,058 --> 00:56:56,593
You planning on having
some kids someday?

998
00:56:56,593 --> 00:56:57,463
God, no.

999
00:56:57,463 --> 00:56:59,289
I'm gonna have an affair

1000
00:56:59,289 --> 00:57:01,633
with some wealthy, big ass politician,

1001
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:04,693
and then blackmail him
for every cent he's worth.

1002
00:57:04,693 --> 00:57:06,466
And then I'll retire in luxury.

1003
00:57:08,010 --> 00:57:08,927
Whatever.

1004
00:57:15,470 --> 00:57:17,415
No, oh no.

1005
00:57:17,415 --> 00:57:18,248
No, no.

1006
00:57:19,417 --> 00:57:20,250
What happened?

1007
00:57:20,250 --> 00:57:23,236
He's coming be for you and the girl.

1008
00:57:23,236 --> 00:57:24,246
Who is coming?

1009
00:57:24,246 --> 00:57:27,291
Anna, stop that right now!

1010
00:57:27,291 --> 00:57:29,045
She's always hungry.

1011
00:57:29,045 --> 00:57:31,123
Now we won't have answers for hours.

1012
00:57:31,123 --> 00:57:32,653
Give me the hand.

1013
00:57:32,653 --> 00:57:35,542
I will reattach it while he's unconscious.

1014
00:57:43,517 --> 00:57:44,350
Hey, hey.

1015
00:57:44,350 --> 00:57:45,373
You speak English?

1016
00:57:45,373 --> 00:57:46,206
Yeah.

1017
00:57:47,563 --> 00:57:49,575
I'm Detective Joe Ross.

1018
00:57:49,575 --> 00:57:51,694
And there's a, I'm looking
for a surgery center.

1019
00:57:51,694 --> 00:57:52,527
It should be close to here.

1020
00:57:52,527 --> 00:57:53,773
You need to stay away from there.

1021
00:57:53,773 --> 00:57:55,213
Bad things happen there.

1022
00:57:55,213 --> 00:57:57,103
Wait, what can you tell me about it?

1023
00:57:57,103 --> 00:57:58,273
There are rumors.

1024
00:57:58,273 --> 00:58:00,643
People go there and they never come back.

1025
00:58:00,643 --> 00:58:01,476
My daughter's there.

1026
00:58:01,476 --> 00:58:02,309
I gotta find her.

1027
00:58:02,309 --> 00:58:03,768
How long has she been there?

1028
00:58:03,768 --> 00:58:05,683
I don't know, a few days, a week.

1029
00:58:05,683 --> 00:58:06,826
Turn around, okay?

1030
00:58:07,815 --> 00:58:08,648
It's too late for her.

1031
00:58:08,648 --> 00:58:11,263
Even if you find her alive,
it won't be what you think.

1032
00:58:11,263 --> 00:58:13,452
What do you mean, what do you mean?

1033
00:58:13,452 --> 00:58:14,648
I mean, I, look, I'm not gonna hurt you.

1034
00:58:14,648 --> 00:58:15,638
I gotta find my daughter.

1035
00:58:15,638 --> 00:58:17,075
Trust me, you don't.

1036
00:58:17,075 --> 00:58:19,423
It'll be her, but it, but it won't.

1037
00:58:19,423 --> 00:58:21,973
She'll be dangerous.

1038
00:58:21,973 --> 00:58:23,653
I've said too much, okay?

1039
00:58:23,653 --> 00:58:26,296
No, just tell me what you know.

1040
00:58:27,399 --> 00:58:28,232
I need to find my daughter!

1041
00:58:28,232 --> 00:58:29,403
They're vampires, okay?

1042
00:58:30,643 --> 00:58:32,263
They'll suck the blood out of you.

1043
00:58:32,263 --> 00:58:34,336
Something happened to my cousin

1044
00:58:34,336 --> 00:58:35,953
and I haven't seen her again.

1045
00:58:35,953 --> 00:58:38,323
The policia, they do nothing.

1046
00:58:38,323 --> 00:58:39,556
It's a curse.

1047
00:58:45,313 --> 00:58:46,800
Vampires?

1048
00:58:50,863 --> 00:58:51,946
Ah, ah, uh!

1049
00:58:54,343 --> 00:58:55,326
Keep peeing blood.

1050
00:58:56,554 --> 00:58:57,906
When's it gonna be yellow again?

1051
00:58:58,843 --> 00:59:00,466
Seriously, no glass?

1052
00:59:01,901 --> 00:59:05,023
Do you know that there's no
mirrors in this entire place?

1053
00:59:05,023 --> 00:59:07,273
How are you feeling?

1054
00:59:07,273 --> 00:59:09,103
Better than Quinn, apparently.

1055
00:59:09,103 --> 00:59:11,203
Yeah, I heard he has blood in his urine.

1056
00:59:12,824 --> 00:59:13,657
I mean,

1057
00:59:13,657 --> 00:59:17,023
they said that after the
operation these would be swollen,

1058
00:59:17,023 --> 00:59:19,153
but this is ridiculous.

1059
00:59:19,153 --> 00:59:21,343
I could take an eye out with these things.

1060
00:59:21,343 --> 00:59:22,593
What do they feel like?

1061
00:59:24,133 --> 00:59:28,153
They feel full, but with
a little bit of pressure.

1062
00:59:28,153 --> 00:59:30,779
You said he wouldn't use implants,

1063
00:59:30,779 --> 00:59:32,083
but those look like implants.

1064
00:59:32,083 --> 00:59:33,463
I know.

1065
00:59:33,463 --> 00:59:36,706
He said it was something about
redirecting the blood flow.

1066
00:59:37,753 --> 00:59:39,376
What's that old joke?

1067
00:59:40,438 --> 00:59:42,366
If guys had boobs, they
wouldn't leave the house.

1068
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:45,815
And I guess the same can be
said about girls with implants.

1069
00:59:45,815 --> 00:59:47,925
Yeah.

1070
00:59:47,925 --> 00:59:48,758
You know what?

1071
00:59:48,758 --> 00:59:50,836
Actually, if you could give me a minute,

1072
00:59:50,836 --> 00:59:51,669
that would be great.

1073
00:59:51,669 --> 00:59:52,753
Yeah.

1074
00:59:52,753 --> 00:59:57,193
Yeah, I'll give you a
minute to self-reflect.

1075
00:59:57,193 --> 01:00:01,273
Ah, yeah, thank you.

1076
01:00:01,273 --> 01:00:03,113
I stopped the bleeding,

1077
01:00:03,113 --> 01:00:04,693
but he has lost a lot of blood.

1078
01:00:04,693 --> 01:00:06,196
He can't afford any more.

1079
01:00:07,183 --> 01:00:10,246
So you come and get me the
moment that he awakens.

1080
01:00:11,203 --> 01:00:12,736
I need to speak with him.

1081
01:00:18,291 --> 01:00:19,705
I will get very upset

1082
01:00:19,705 --> 01:00:22,940
if I see one bite mark anywhere on him!

1083
01:00:36,830 --> 01:00:37,730
You are a fighter.

1084
01:00:39,007 --> 01:00:39,840
I'll give you that.

1085
01:00:41,457 --> 01:00:43,693
Please, end this misery.

1086
01:00:43,693 --> 01:00:44,693
Oh, you're lonely.

1087
01:00:45,643 --> 01:00:46,636
I understand.

1088
01:00:47,953 --> 01:00:51,706
But don't worry, you'll have company soon.

1089
01:00:53,023 --> 01:00:54,766
Three more will be bled.

1090
01:00:55,663 --> 01:00:57,136
Why are you doing this?

1091
01:00:59,113 --> 01:01:00,886
Simple supply and demand.

1092
01:01:02,053 --> 01:01:05,450
Now I have a question for you.

1093
01:01:07,133 --> 01:01:09,183
Who do you call the day that you escaped?

1094
01:01:10,033 --> 01:01:14,353
Nobody, I, I couldn't get through.

1095
01:01:14,353 --> 01:01:15,196
I told you.

1096
01:01:16,590 --> 01:01:18,316
Then no one is looking for you?

1097
01:01:22,213 --> 01:01:23,836
I hear differently.

1098
01:01:26,350 --> 01:01:29,050
I could take you back to the
operation room right now.

1099
01:01:30,707 --> 01:01:33,343
Don't make me drain you dry.

1100
01:01:33,343 --> 01:01:35,386
Please, drain me.

1101
01:01:36,336 --> 01:01:37,786
I don't wanna live like this.

1102
01:02:15,154 --> 01:02:16,723
That's Madeline.

1103
01:02:16,723 --> 01:02:18,826
Someone that I knew a long time ago.

1104
01:02:20,032 --> 01:02:21,913
You could call her the one that got away.

1105
01:02:21,913 --> 01:02:24,943
Sorry, I, I was just looking around.

1106
01:02:24,943 --> 01:02:25,776
I don't mind.

1107
01:02:27,758 --> 01:02:29,677
And how are your friends doing?

1108
01:02:29,677 --> 01:02:31,227
Um, they're upstairs resting.

1109
01:02:32,203 --> 01:02:35,323
Sky's a little concerned
over the swelling.

1110
01:02:35,323 --> 01:02:37,378
But it's normal, you know,

1111
01:02:37,378 --> 01:02:39,323
a few days after the surgery.

1112
01:02:39,323 --> 01:02:42,223
And your friend Kurtland, how is he doing?

1113
01:02:42,223 --> 01:02:43,786
Peeing blood, I think.

1114
01:02:44,923 --> 01:02:47,983
How's that man with the hand injury?

1115
01:02:47,983 --> 01:02:49,908
Oh, he's recovering.

1116
01:02:49,908 --> 01:02:51,310
But don't you concern about him.

1117
01:02:56,683 --> 01:02:58,966
You just look just like her.

1118
01:03:01,723 --> 01:03:04,573
That photo looks like it
was taken a hundred years ago.

1119
01:03:05,473 --> 01:03:06,406
Who was she?

1120
01:03:07,513 --> 01:03:09,993
I'd rather talk about yourself.

1121
01:03:09,993 --> 01:03:10,966
Do you drink?

1122
01:03:11,923 --> 01:03:13,373
Only if someone's offering.

1123
01:03:19,423 --> 01:03:21,088
Oh, hey.

1124
01:03:21,088 --> 01:03:21,943
How'd your surgery go?

1125
01:03:21,943 --> 01:03:23,413
Better than mine, I hope.

1126
01:03:23,413 --> 01:03:25,243
I don't feel very well.

1127
01:03:25,243 --> 01:03:26,866
I thought walking might help.

1128
01:03:28,633 --> 01:03:30,787
Yeah, they told me to do some movement,

1129
01:03:30,787 --> 01:03:32,587
but it's not working.

1130
01:03:32,587 --> 01:03:34,243
I keep bleeding even when I'm not pissing.

1131
01:03:34,243 --> 01:03:35,076
Look.

1132
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,573
Ugh.

1133
01:03:37,573 --> 01:03:40,963
Same with me, and the blood's
a different color, right?

1134
01:03:40,963 --> 01:03:41,796
Yeah.

1135
01:03:43,393 --> 01:03:44,563
What about Alana?

1136
01:03:44,563 --> 01:03:46,303
She's having issues, too.

1137
01:03:46,303 --> 01:03:47,446
It hurts her to walk.

1138
01:03:51,433 --> 01:03:52,266
Thanks.

1139
01:03:53,947 --> 01:03:54,780
What is it?

1140
01:03:54,780 --> 01:03:57,493
Oh, it's just a special cocktail.

1141
01:03:57,493 --> 01:03:58,743
Does it have a name?

1142
01:03:58,743 --> 01:04:01,483
I, I worked my way through
school as a bartender.

1143
01:04:01,483 --> 01:04:03,493
I know nearly every drink.

1144
01:04:03,493 --> 01:04:05,776
No, it's just my own private recipe.

1145
01:04:07,063 --> 01:04:10,696
Then let's call it
the Dr. Pavor special.

1146
01:04:13,990 --> 01:04:14,823
Let's drink too that.

1147
01:04:18,094 --> 01:04:19,086
Go on, go on.

1148
01:04:19,086 --> 01:04:20,406
It's gonna put some hair on your chest.

1149
01:04:21,373 --> 01:04:22,416
That's the last thing I need.

1150
01:04:24,463 --> 01:04:26,173
What do you need, Madeline?

1151
01:04:26,173 --> 01:04:28,636
Ma'am, I'm sorry, Madison,

1152
01:04:29,773 --> 01:04:31,546
tell me your hopes and your dreams.

1153
01:04:32,743 --> 01:04:34,546
Perhaps I can make them come true.

1154
01:04:35,383 --> 01:04:36,376
I doubt it.

1155
01:04:42,613 --> 01:04:44,896
I wanna open my own lesbian bar.

1156
01:04:46,573 --> 01:04:49,036
Are you and Miss Winslow a couple?

1157
01:04:50,478 --> 01:04:51,823
We're just good friends.

1158
01:04:51,823 --> 01:04:53,833
I like your nurse Anna, though.

1159
01:04:53,833 --> 01:04:55,783
I'd like to have her.

1160
01:04:55,783 --> 01:04:58,453
I'm sure she would like to have you.

1161
01:04:58,453 --> 01:04:59,286
Drink up.

1162
01:05:07,364 --> 01:05:08,593
Wow.

1163
01:05:08,593 --> 01:05:09,673
What's in this?

1164
01:05:09,673 --> 01:05:11,416
Remember, it's a secret recipe.

1165
01:05:12,500 --> 01:05:13,333
Yeah, my heart is racing.

1166
01:05:13,333 --> 01:05:14,783
Oh yeah, it really pumps your blood.

1167
01:05:16,153 --> 01:05:18,415
You know that offer?

1168
01:05:18,415 --> 01:05:20,015
The free removal of your tattoo?

1169
01:05:21,636 --> 01:05:23,053
Let me see yours.

1170
01:05:30,103 --> 01:05:32,039
He woke up, Dr. Pavor.

1171
01:05:32,039 --> 01:05:32,916
Stop her!

1172
01:05:32,916 --> 01:05:34,914
Don't let it go!

1173
01:05:37,615 --> 01:05:40,273
I really feel like Alana's the one.

1174
01:05:40,273 --> 01:05:41,955
Guys, where's Alana?

1175
01:05:41,955 --> 01:05:43,873
We need to get her and
get out of here right now.

1176
01:05:43,873 --> 01:05:46,665
Fangs out, losers.

1177
01:05:46,665 --> 01:05:48,429
What the fuck is that?

1178
01:05:51,043 --> 01:05:52,246
They're vampires.

1179
01:06:01,069 --> 01:06:01,902
I heard you like me.

1180
01:06:01,902 --> 01:06:03,493
Please move.

1181
01:06:03,493 --> 01:06:05,396
I don't wanna hurt you.

1182
01:06:05,396 --> 01:06:07,993
Oh yeah, so you just leave
your friends behind like that?

1183
01:06:07,993 --> 01:06:10,123
So what if I like you?

1184
01:06:10,123 --> 01:06:11,773
How could it work?

1185
01:06:11,773 --> 01:06:15,058
Well, I could give you a taste

1186
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:17,108
or you could give me a little taste, huh?

1187
01:06:18,673 --> 01:06:19,876
I'll give you a taste.

1188
01:06:41,739 --> 01:06:43,391
Ah, no!

1189
01:06:48,046 --> 01:06:49,333
Ah!

1190
01:06:49,333 --> 01:06:50,850
I'm not a vampire.

1191
01:06:53,430 --> 01:06:54,263
Okay.

1192
01:06:55,706 --> 01:06:56,539
Am I gonna live?

1193
01:06:58,213 --> 01:06:59,266
Not forever.

1194
01:07:01,033 --> 01:07:03,313
Now, who is coming?

1195
01:07:03,313 --> 01:07:06,045
It's the father of
that girl that escaped.

1196
01:07:06,045 --> 01:07:07,379
I think she called him.

1197
01:07:07,379 --> 01:07:08,867
Oh, I knew it.

1198
01:07:08,867 --> 01:07:10,033
Did he do that to you?

1199
01:07:10,033 --> 01:07:11,633
Yeah, and he killed Tony, too.

1200
01:07:12,507 --> 01:07:14,826
Oh, he shows up here,
he's gonna be dealt with.

1201
01:07:17,413 --> 01:07:21,073
Wait, can't you get me that stuff?

1202
01:07:21,073 --> 01:07:23,356
Look, I need it to fix my arm.

1203
01:07:24,241 --> 01:07:25,132
You promised me.

1204
01:07:25,132 --> 01:07:26,320
You promised me the stuff.

1205
01:07:26,320 --> 01:07:27,153
I'm the liaison for the cartel.

1206
01:07:27,153 --> 01:07:30,616
You promised me to give me
this stuff to make me better.

1207
01:07:31,521 --> 01:07:32,981
Give me it, please.

1208
01:07:32,981 --> 01:07:34,398
That's all I'm asking.

1209
01:07:50,711 --> 01:07:53,066
Dr. Pavor, Madison killed Anna.

1210
01:07:53,066 --> 01:07:54,872
Yeah, I felt her loss.

1211
01:07:54,872 --> 01:07:55,705
Where's Madison?

1212
01:07:55,705 --> 01:07:57,649
I took her to the operating room.

1213
01:07:57,649 --> 01:07:58,482
Everyone is ready for you.

1214
01:07:58,482 --> 01:07:59,596
You will be rewarded,

1215
01:08:00,823 --> 01:08:03,853
and then you help me avenge Anna's death.

1216
01:08:03,853 --> 01:08:05,053
Are you gonna turn me?

1217
01:08:11,915 --> 01:08:13,561
Drink.

1218
01:08:17,353 --> 01:08:18,696
It won't take long, my friend.

1219
01:08:53,773 --> 01:08:54,856
Now I'm a vampire.

1220
01:08:56,278 --> 01:08:57,111
You suck.

1221
01:08:57,973 --> 01:08:59,962
What the fuck is this?

1222
01:08:59,962 --> 01:09:01,525
Get this thing off me.

1223
01:09:01,525 --> 01:09:02,358
What's going on?

1224
01:09:02,358 --> 01:09:04,313
Would you like your questions answered?

1225
01:09:05,293 --> 01:09:07,363
Perhaps I owe you that much.

1226
01:09:07,363 --> 01:09:08,413
Yes.

1227
01:09:08,413 --> 01:09:10,393
Why are you doing this to us?

1228
01:09:10,393 --> 01:09:14,296
When Madeline turned me into
vampire dust many years ago,

1229
01:09:15,839 --> 01:09:17,686
I made use of my skills as a doctor,

1230
01:09:18,673 --> 01:09:21,616
and we look into a safe
way to secure blood.

1231
01:09:22,722 --> 01:09:26,203
Just like humans raise their
crops and vital liquids.

1232
01:09:26,203 --> 01:09:27,606
Why couldn't we do the same to humans?

1233
01:09:28,749 --> 01:09:30,512
What's gonna happen to us?

1234
01:09:30,512 --> 01:09:32,262
Your breasts are overflowing now.

1235
01:09:33,523 --> 01:09:35,146
Same goes to your genitals.

1236
01:09:36,602 --> 01:09:40,050
You must be bled once or twice a day,

1237
01:09:40,050 --> 01:09:42,816
or you will die due to the
building pressure in your body.

1238
01:09:43,910 --> 01:09:45,973
How many others have you done this to?

1239
01:09:45,973 --> 01:09:50,416
Faye here, she came for a
nose job and other body works.

1240
01:09:51,909 --> 01:09:53,309
It didn't go as she planned.

1241
01:09:56,620 --> 01:09:58,996
By the way, you tasted her earlier.

1242
01:10:00,283 --> 01:10:01,876
That cocktail that you drunk.

1243
01:10:02,743 --> 01:10:03,676
You're sick.

1244
01:10:04,513 --> 01:10:05,353
Oh, it's addictive.

1245
01:10:05,353 --> 01:10:08,293
That's why I have clients
in powerful positions

1246
01:10:08,293 --> 01:10:10,573
helping me finance my work.

1247
01:10:10,573 --> 01:10:12,945
You're selling this blood to humans?

1248
01:10:12,945 --> 01:10:15,013
It's better than any
other drug on the market.

1249
01:10:15,013 --> 01:10:17,446
You remember that man that lost his hand?

1250
01:10:18,651 --> 01:10:20,236
He was nearly dead hours ago.

1251
01:10:22,453 --> 01:10:23,286
Smite.

1252
01:10:26,486 --> 01:10:27,319
Come in here.

1253
01:10:28,823 --> 01:10:31,396
I gave him a dose and look at him now.

1254
01:10:33,860 --> 01:10:34,693
How do you feel?

1255
01:10:34,693 --> 01:10:35,626
Excellent.

1256
01:10:38,143 --> 01:10:41,173
Oh, I see we've got new cattle.

1257
01:10:41,173 --> 01:10:42,376
Oh, good.

1258
01:10:43,450 --> 01:10:45,219
Very, very, good.

1259
01:10:45,219 --> 01:10:47,023
You can tell the cartel
that our next shipment

1260
01:10:47,023 --> 01:10:49,696
will be going out tomorrow as planned.

1261
01:10:53,173 --> 01:10:54,006
What is that?

1262
01:10:54,984 --> 01:10:57,030
There's a security breach upstairs.

1263
01:10:57,030 --> 01:10:57,903
It's in the back door.

1264
01:10:57,903 --> 01:10:59,293
It's him, I know it's him.

1265
01:10:59,293 --> 01:11:00,762
You know what?

1266
01:11:00,762 --> 01:11:02,323
I'll handle it myself.

1267
01:11:02,323 --> 01:11:05,386
This time, it's personal.

1268
01:11:07,603 --> 01:11:09,133
Dad.

1269
01:11:09,133 --> 01:11:10,846
That's right, my dear.

1270
01:11:11,743 --> 01:11:13,696
He was foolish to try to to save you,

1271
01:11:14,724 --> 01:11:16,494
and now he's going to die.

1272
01:11:33,343 --> 01:11:34,636
So we meet again.

1273
01:11:35,478 --> 01:11:36,673
What the?

1274
01:11:36,673 --> 01:11:37,783
Where's my daughter?

1275
01:11:37,783 --> 01:11:38,746
Oh, in hell.

1276
01:11:39,993 --> 01:11:41,353
And you're gonna follow her.

1277
01:11:41,353 --> 01:11:43,063
Stay where you are.

1278
01:11:43,063 --> 01:11:46,276
Tell me where she is, I'll let you live.

1279
01:11:48,523 --> 01:11:49,756
I've changed.

1280
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:52,273
You can't hurt me now.

1281
01:11:52,273 --> 01:11:53,536
I'm invincible!

1282
01:11:54,578 --> 01:11:55,843
And I'm Superman.

1283
01:11:55,843 --> 01:11:58,813
Where's my daughter?

1284
01:11:58,813 --> 01:11:59,833
Dad!

1285
01:11:59,833 --> 01:12:03,016
Oh you are responsible
for his fate, Faye.

1286
01:12:04,118 --> 01:12:05,316
I hope that you are aware of that.

1287
01:12:06,599 --> 01:12:07,619
No!

1288
01:12:07,619 --> 01:12:08,496
That's it!

1289
01:12:08,496 --> 01:12:09,673
Now I'm going to drain you completely dry

1290
01:12:09,673 --> 01:12:11,946
now that I have others to take your place!

1291
01:12:19,813 --> 01:12:20,806
Invincible?

1292
01:12:21,703 --> 01:12:22,876
You're not invincible.

1293
01:12:24,943 --> 01:12:25,816
I'm coming, Faye.

1294
01:12:26,953 --> 01:12:27,796
Daddy's coming.

1295
01:12:30,223 --> 01:12:31,426
Check on Smites.

1296
01:12:37,693 --> 01:12:38,743
What to do about you?

1297
01:12:40,123 --> 01:12:41,956
I had such plans.

1298
01:12:43,153 --> 01:12:46,246
You were going to be my
third bride, Madison.

1299
01:12:47,953 --> 01:12:50,416
I was gonna make you part of my family.

1300
01:12:51,913 --> 01:12:54,896
We were going to be connected forever.

1301
01:12:58,123 --> 01:12:59,123
No thanks.

1302
01:13:00,005 --> 01:13:01,874
You had to disfigure yourself.

1303
01:13:01,874 --> 01:13:04,093
I cannot be close enough
to you to save you.

1304
01:13:04,093 --> 01:13:05,931
First time in my life

1305
01:13:05,931 --> 01:13:08,716
I'm grateful I went to an
all girls Catholic school.

1306
01:13:08,716 --> 01:13:10,123
They made you burn that into your flesh.

1307
01:13:10,123 --> 01:13:12,583
No, the nuns hated it.

1308
01:13:12,583 --> 01:13:14,413
That's why I did it.

1309
01:13:14,413 --> 01:13:15,376
What a waste.

1310
01:13:16,213 --> 01:13:18,226
That abomination tainted your blood.

1311
01:13:19,216 --> 01:13:20,466
You're useless to me now.

1312
01:13:26,086 --> 01:13:29,146
You will be empty soon and finally free.

1313
01:14:06,583 --> 01:14:09,675
I heal quickly now.

1314
01:14:09,675 --> 01:14:12,373
I'm going to kill you so slowly

1315
01:14:12,373 --> 01:14:15,853
and you'll never see your baby girl again.

1316
01:14:15,853 --> 01:14:18,796
You will die knowing that
you couldn't save her.

1317
01:14:25,124 --> 01:14:27,466
Maria Angela, she's hurt.

1318
01:14:29,022 --> 01:14:30,757
I'll kill him myself.

1319
01:14:33,378 --> 01:14:35,228
I'll see Faye again, but you won't.

1320
01:14:38,377 --> 01:14:39,562
Madison.

1321
01:14:39,562 --> 01:14:40,395
What?

1322
01:14:40,395 --> 01:14:42,463
See the cord on the floor by your feet?

1323
01:14:42,463 --> 01:14:44,563
See if you can kick it loose.

1324
01:14:44,563 --> 01:14:47,306
Unplug it and then we'll
stop the blood pumps.

1325
01:14:51,636 --> 01:14:52,469
Okay.

1326
01:14:58,179 --> 01:14:59,012
Thank you.

1327
01:14:59,012 --> 01:15:00,283
Now go, help my dad.

1328
01:15:00,283 --> 01:15:01,942
What about my friends?

1329
01:15:01,942 --> 01:15:03,733
I'll free them, I know how.

1330
01:15:03,733 --> 01:15:04,566
I have enough strength.

1331
01:15:04,566 --> 01:15:05,593
Now go, please.

1332
01:15:05,593 --> 01:15:06,826
My dad is in trouble.

1333
01:15:15,936 --> 01:15:17,803
I was warned about vampires.

1334
01:15:17,803 --> 01:15:20,105
I never really believed they existed,

1335
01:15:20,105 --> 01:15:21,526
but I guess they're real.

1336
01:15:23,077 --> 01:15:26,593
What are you some doctor surgeon vampire?

1337
01:15:26,593 --> 01:15:29,093
Most people needs to see
it with their own eyes.

1338
01:15:30,223 --> 01:15:31,273
You have been bitten.

1339
01:15:32,473 --> 01:15:34,543
It's just a scratch.

1340
01:15:34,543 --> 01:15:36,953
What if you're done with my daughter?

1341
01:15:36,953 --> 01:15:39,096
You should be more
concerned with yourself.

1342
01:15:40,176 --> 01:15:42,556
You can turn soon, if you don't die first.

1343
01:15:43,886 --> 01:15:45,136
Is it Dr. Pavor, is it?

1344
01:15:46,229 --> 01:15:47,833
What is that, some weird vampire name?

1345
01:15:47,833 --> 01:15:49,843
Hey, how about you just gimme my daughter

1346
01:15:49,843 --> 01:15:51,829
and we'll get outta here.

1347
01:15:51,829 --> 01:15:53,705
You're a fool, you know that?

1348
01:15:53,705 --> 01:15:55,455
You came out this way for nothing.

1349
01:15:55,455 --> 01:15:57,943
Look, asshole, I'm gonna
give you one more chance.

1350
01:15:57,943 --> 01:16:00,946
You tell me where my daughter
is, I'll let you live.

1351
01:16:02,223 --> 01:16:03,056
Otherwise I'm gonna kill you

1352
01:16:03,056 --> 01:16:05,203
just like I did your nurse friend here.

1353
01:16:05,203 --> 01:16:07,933
Vampire or no vampire.

1354
01:16:07,933 --> 01:16:10,543
You know that your threats
are not amusing, right?

1355
01:16:10,543 --> 01:16:12,593
What kind of death are you to serve, huh?

1356
01:16:13,525 --> 01:16:15,525
Slow, quick, or eternal?

1357
01:16:18,780 --> 01:16:20,956
Oh, do you expect to kill me with that?

1358
01:16:21,889 --> 01:16:24,016
No, I'm the weapon.

1359
01:16:26,353 --> 01:16:28,573
I must have been blessed
over a hundred times

1360
01:16:28,573 --> 01:16:29,746
by the nuns in school.

1361
01:16:30,583 --> 01:16:32,083
You said my blood was tainted.

1362
01:16:34,107 --> 01:16:36,546
I bet holy blood is even more
powerful than holy water.

1363
01:16:37,753 --> 01:16:39,196
Detective, grab him.

1364
01:16:42,613 --> 01:16:43,546
You thirsty?

1365
01:16:44,713 --> 01:16:46,276
Try my special cocktail.

1366
01:16:50,603 --> 01:16:51,603
Oh my, ah!

1367
01:17:00,343 --> 01:17:01,516
What the fuck?

1368
01:17:07,813 --> 01:17:09,180
Do you know her Faye is?

1369
01:17:09,180 --> 01:17:10,013
Is she still alive?

1370
01:17:10,013 --> 01:17:10,846
Yeah, follow me.

1371
01:17:23,460 --> 01:17:24,710
Faye's in here.

1372
01:17:26,564 --> 01:17:29,823
♪ Na na na na na na na ♪

1373
01:17:29,823 --> 01:17:31,872
No, what did you do?

1374
01:17:35,036 --> 01:17:36,193
- Faye.
- Dad.

1375
01:17:36,193 --> 01:17:37,816
Faye, oh my God, oh my God.

1376
01:17:38,923 --> 01:17:40,181
What did he do to you?

1377
01:17:40,181 --> 01:17:41,056
Are you okay?
Yeah.

1378
01:17:41,056 --> 01:17:42,716
Oh, I'm okay.

1379
01:17:42,716 --> 01:17:43,663
Oh, but you're hurt.

1380
01:17:43,663 --> 01:17:44,496
Oh no.

1381
01:17:45,420 --> 01:17:47,233
It's just a scratch, I'm fine.

1382
01:17:47,233 --> 01:17:48,433
We gotta get outta here.

1383
01:17:49,813 --> 01:17:51,523
What were you thinking?

1384
01:17:51,523 --> 01:17:54,246
Coming down to Mexico for
surgery without telling anyone?

1385
01:17:55,183 --> 01:17:56,698
I know things,

1386
01:17:56,698 --> 01:17:58,396
I know things haven't been
great since the divorce,

1387
01:17:58,396 --> 01:18:01,000
and I haven't been
paying attention to you,

1388
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:03,800
but this is, this is like really bad.

1389
01:18:04,729 --> 01:18:06,163
And I'm really sorry I messed up,

1390
01:18:06,163 --> 01:18:09,060
but when we get back, we'll
work it out, all right?

1391
01:18:09,060 --> 01:18:11,924
I know I should have
said something to you,

1392
01:18:11,924 --> 01:18:15,643
but I really wanted the surgery
and, and you and mom were...

1393
01:18:15,643 --> 01:18:18,043
It means the world that you came for me.

1394
01:18:18,043 --> 01:18:20,143
Great, but, but we gotta get outta here.

1395
01:18:25,123 --> 01:18:25,996
I had to.

1396
01:18:27,416 --> 01:18:30,043
I couldn't let them live like human cows.

1397
01:18:30,043 --> 01:18:31,860
Don't worry about it.

1398
01:18:31,860 --> 01:18:32,737
I'm gonna fix this.

1399
01:18:32,737 --> 01:18:34,566
I'm gonna tell, tell 'em Pavor
butcher them all then fled.

1400
01:18:35,833 --> 01:18:38,783
Then we can go back and
we can be a family again.

1401
01:18:38,783 --> 01:18:39,616
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1402
01:18:39,616 --> 01:18:41,293
I'd like to live like a family again.

1403
01:18:42,703 --> 01:18:47,113
But, you've been bitten
and I've been damaged.

1404
01:18:47,113 --> 01:18:47,946
No.

1405
01:18:48,823 --> 01:18:50,053
Whatever that maniac did to you,

1406
01:18:50,053 --> 01:18:52,051
we'll fix it, we'll fix it.

1407
01:18:52,051 --> 01:18:54,447
I'm gonna, I'm gonna make
everything go right again.

1408
01:18:54,447 --> 01:18:55,319
All right?

1409
01:18:55,319 --> 01:18:56,256
If you just for, just for, forgive me.

1410
01:18:58,293 --> 01:18:59,126
I forgive you.

1411
01:19:00,763 --> 01:19:02,383
Can you forgive me?

1412
01:19:02,383 --> 01:19:03,226
Forgive you?

1413
01:19:04,596 --> 01:19:05,429
You're, you're my daughter.

1414
01:19:05,429 --> 01:19:07,925
Forgive you-

1415
01:19:07,925 --> 01:19:09,696
I couldn't let you
become one of them, Dad.

1416
01:19:11,143 --> 01:19:12,766
And I can't live with this.

1417
01:19:14,716 --> 01:19:16,393
- Stop her, stop her!
- No, no!

1418
01:19:16,393 --> 01:19:19,453
Please take her home to her
mother so she can get help.

1419
01:19:19,453 --> 01:19:20,896
She killed my friends!

1420
01:19:22,126 --> 01:19:24,886
Please, promise me you'll take her home.

1421
01:19:27,853 --> 01:19:28,686
Please.

1422
01:19:34,273 --> 01:19:35,956
Why should I let you live?

1423
01:19:37,963 --> 01:19:38,796
You shouldn't.

1424
01:19:40,303 --> 01:19:41,780
I deserve to die.

1425
01:20:08,284 --> 01:20:10,784
Come on, let's get you home.
