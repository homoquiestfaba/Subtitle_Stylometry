1
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,189
I'm sorry, I had an exam...

2
00:01:14,920 --> 00:01:16,638
Something to drink?

3
00:01:17,080 --> 00:01:20,197
Water please, non-carbonated.

4
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,757
Any history of disease?

5
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:38,710
No, I've never had
any infectious disease

6
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:43,110
or any... female problems...

7
00:01:45,400 --> 00:01:47,834
- Do you have your tests?
- Yes.

8
00:01:56,080 --> 00:01:57,832
Here they are.

9
00:01:59,440 --> 00:02:01,271
Do you snort anything?

10
00:02:01,960 --> 00:02:03,678
No, I don't take drugs.

11
00:02:04,480 --> 00:02:06,118
I don't even smoke.

12
00:02:08,320 --> 00:02:11,437
Are you sure about this?
And you know the price?

13
00:02:13,480 --> 00:02:16,278
Yes, I do. So Iet's not bargain.

14
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:19,710
I need cash, fast.

15
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:32,718
I want1 5,000.

16
00:04:51,560 --> 00:04:53,835
Are we staying or leaving?

17
00:04:55,680 --> 00:04:58,194
What's the problem? You OK?

18
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,035
He keeps on staring at us.

19
00:05:02,400 --> 00:05:04,960
So what? He's probably
trying to pick you up.

20
00:05:55,400 --> 00:05:57,675
That's my ride.

21
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,553
Is there anything worth
seeing in Warsaw?

22
00:06:07,920 --> 00:06:10,514
We are.
Isn't that enough for you?

23
00:06:10,880 --> 00:06:12,836
Meet our driver.

24
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:26,999
- So where to?
- Let's get a drink in our office,

25
00:06:27,320 --> 00:06:29,550
and then decide.

26
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:36,158
You packed already? We've got
so much time in the morning.

27
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:39,034
You always do things at the last
minute, and you're always late.

28
00:06:39,400 --> 00:06:42,676
Oh, chill out. You never know
when is your last minute.

29
00:06:43,040 --> 00:06:46,112
Yeah, yeah.
You always know best.

30
00:06:55,480 --> 00:06:57,710
Wanna dance?

31
00:07:04,480 --> 00:07:07,836
Drink up. You won't have
to drive those dorks around.

32
00:07:08,200 --> 00:07:11,510
You want me to lose my customers?
Where are you guys going?

33
00:07:11,880 --> 00:07:15,509
First, to the Mzury Lakes,
and then we're all going to work.

34
00:07:15,880 --> 00:07:18,314
- Where to?
- Switzerland.

35
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:21,314
And what are you going to do there?

36
00:07:23,400 --> 00:07:25,516
Definitely not work in a rice field.

37
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:29,230
I don't know, babysit,
clean houses, whatever.

38
00:07:29,600 --> 00:07:32,990
Mybe at the pool.
I'm a diving instructor.

39
00:07:33,360 --> 00:07:34,429
I dive, too.

40
00:07:34,800 --> 00:07:39,112
Really? Can you find a wetsuit
to fit your big... frame?

41
00:07:44,480 --> 00:07:48,234
Let's get to know each other better...
But too late since you're leaving.

42
00:07:49,880 --> 00:07:51,677
So come with us...

43
00:08:40,720 --> 00:08:42,836
Come on...

44
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,312
Come on...

45
00:08:53,400 --> 00:08:54,799
Buzzed...

46
00:08:55,160 --> 00:08:59,870
Ola lives next door but
you have to give Agata a ride.

47
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:07,630
Call me in the morning
and we'll go together.

48
00:09:08,400 --> 00:09:11,597
- Will you be up?
- I'm not going to lay down at all.

49
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:26,078
He'll drop you off.
But watch out, he's naughty...

50
00:09:27,520 --> 00:09:31,877
Naughty? I'm into that.
You'll take me home?

51
00:09:33,480 --> 00:09:37,155
Agata, Agata... nice.

52
00:11:19,960 --> 00:11:21,757
Something to drink...

53
00:11:22,080 --> 00:11:24,548
Haven't had enough?
Thank God you're alive.

54
00:11:24,880 --> 00:11:27,792
Looks like the car is totalled.

55
00:11:28,520 --> 00:11:31,398
You guys always come out clean.

56
00:11:31,720 --> 00:11:35,679
And the girl's in a coma.
Look what you've done to her.

57
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:03,708
What's her name?
She doesn't have any lD on her.

58
00:12:06,240 --> 00:12:07,389
Agata...

59
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:12,111
I have to call her family.
It doesn't look good.

60
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:29,232
I fucked up. Come and get me.

61
00:12:31,480 --> 00:12:33,038
Where am l?

62
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:46,512
Are you kidding me?
Where are you?

63
00:13:56,080 --> 00:13:57,957
You were wasted.

64
00:13:58,360 --> 00:14:02,148
You have no idea how much I paid
that butcher in the hospital

65
00:14:02,480 --> 00:14:04,630
for the documents
before the pigs came.

66
00:14:05,000 --> 00:14:07,798
Any idea where you crashed?

67
00:14:08,120 --> 00:14:10,873
They said it was in the forest
around here. So where are you?

68
00:14:11,200 --> 00:14:14,829
- Go to the grocery store.
- Grocery? What grocery?

69
00:14:17,200 --> 00:14:18,633
Got it.

70
00:14:22,000 --> 00:14:23,558
You alone?

71
00:14:28,520 --> 00:14:32,035
We're not gonna talk through
the window. Where are you?

72
00:14:32,400 --> 00:14:33,628
AII right...

73
00:14:34,000 --> 00:14:35,831
Turn around.

74
00:14:55,120 --> 00:14:58,317
They'll figure out
how you drove off the road.

75
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:01,397
Stupid joke, huh?

76
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:03,919
Will they go for it?

77
00:15:04,880 --> 00:15:07,633
Otherwise I'm screwed
with insurance.

78
00:15:08,240 --> 00:15:10,117
Someone's been snoopin' around.

79
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:14,598
Forget it. The girl will come out
of this. Just stay away.

80
00:15:16,400 --> 00:15:18,675
I'm not going to leave her there.

81
00:15:20,360 --> 00:15:21,952
Forget it!

82
00:15:25,040 --> 00:15:26,917
You're gonna get us in trouble.

83
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:35,871
Nice view. I've never been here.

84
00:15:42,080 --> 00:15:44,036
What would you like to drink?

85
00:15:44,360 --> 00:15:46,555
Tomato juice with ice, please.

86
00:15:47,000 --> 00:15:50,754
You didn't look so hot last night.
How do you feel?

87
00:15:55,880 --> 00:15:58,440
So did you pack?
Coming with us?

88
00:16:02,040 --> 00:16:04,395
Do you know where Agata lives?

89
00:16:11,840 --> 00:16:13,512
She's in the hospital.

90
00:16:14,800 --> 00:16:16,950
I crashed the car.

91
00:16:18,440 --> 00:16:19,953
She's dying.

92
00:16:35,400 --> 00:16:37,630
Oh, Mrta. Come in.

93
00:16:43,880 --> 00:16:46,633
How will you pack all this stuff?

94
00:16:48,000 --> 00:16:52,278
We need to speak. Where is
Agata? I have no patience for her.

95
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:56,719
I want to talk to you
before Agata comes in.

96
00:16:57,320 --> 00:17:01,108
You can take this down.
And leave this tank for me.

97
00:17:01,480 --> 00:17:03,471
Please, take a seat.

98
00:17:03,800 --> 00:17:05,597
Sir, please, take a seat.

99
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:07,799
Listen...

100
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:12,919
I know I shouldn't stick my nose in,
but I had a dream.

101
00:17:14,320 --> 00:17:18,757
I always worry when Agata
goes on your diving trips.

102
00:17:19,600 --> 00:17:23,070
I dreamt that you were
all swimming

103
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:27,434
and she was sitting
on the bottom of the lake.

104
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:30,228
- Enough already!
- It was horrible,

105
00:17:30,600 --> 00:17:32,955
because she looked like...

106
00:17:34,240 --> 00:17:36,117
Iike she was dead.

107
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:41,237
I beg you, talk to her.
She shouldn't dive this time.

108
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:55,469
Do you have any sedatives,
ma'am?

109
00:17:57,240 --> 00:17:59,993
Of course, how many do you need?

110
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,673
A lot.

111
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,039
Can I ask you for a glass of water?

112
00:18:11,400 --> 00:18:12,879
Yes, of course.

113
00:18:24,080 --> 00:18:26,275
Just please...

114
00:18:27,200 --> 00:18:28,713
Please...

115
00:18:30,040 --> 00:18:34,033
Don't... don't panic...

116
00:18:45,000 --> 00:18:46,956
Did you sober up?

117
00:18:57,960 --> 00:19:01,396
You're not allowed in here.
Stop or I'll call security.

118
00:19:02,880 --> 00:19:05,189
- I have to talk to her.
- You can't.

119
00:19:13,640 --> 00:19:16,438
You can't speak to her...
because she's dead.

120
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,358
Who was that?

121
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,599
You're escaping, my boy.
And people die here...

122
00:19:36,800 --> 00:19:40,315
The paramedic found this
in your crashed car.

123
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:45,628
Olka!

124
00:19:56,600 --> 00:20:01,355
She was totally beaten up
and they had to remove her kidney,

125
00:20:05,240 --> 00:20:08,516
This one here came from Romania
with no lD on her.

126
00:20:10,920 --> 00:20:13,559
So she went through
a difficult surgery.

127
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:21,990
But she died from something else:
blood transfusion.

128
00:20:22,680 --> 00:20:25,035
They gave her the wrong
type of blood.

129
00:20:31,720 --> 00:20:34,553
- It's not written here.
- Yes,

130
00:20:34,920 --> 00:20:38,117
but I read people's guts
like a book.

131
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,959
It's a rare case.

132
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:44,359
Her whole body was infected.
She didn't have a chance.

133
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:49,151
Someone gave her
the wrong type of blood.

134
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:52,353
Mybe the nurse, or maybe
they misidentified her type?

135
00:20:52,680 --> 00:20:54,796
What's the difference,
she's gone.

136
00:20:55,160 --> 00:20:56,798
I want to see her.

137
00:20:58,040 --> 00:21:03,319
This Romanian has been waiting
for months to be burned.

138
00:21:05,960 --> 00:21:08,872
But they took yours instead.

139
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:15,440
What you wanna see, ashes?

140
00:21:24,400 --> 00:21:26,914
What'll you tell him? "ls the girl
weighing on your conscience?"

141
00:21:27,720 --> 00:21:29,836
What conscience?

142
00:21:30,840 --> 00:21:32,990
You want to let him off the hook?

143
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:36,397
- She's dead and it's not my fault.
- Let's leave that to the police.

144
00:21:48,160 --> 00:21:49,639
Do I know you?

145
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,436
Andrzej Kozlowski?

146
00:21:54,600 --> 00:21:57,637
ID or a badge, please.

147
00:21:57,960 --> 00:22:01,111
Though it doesn't really matter,
you can forge anything.

148
00:22:01,480 --> 00:22:03,391
Let's wait with the police stuff...

149
00:22:04,800 --> 00:22:06,438
Nice pad.

150
00:22:09,960 --> 00:22:11,439
An art expert.

151
00:22:11,920 --> 00:22:13,990
So you're from... the lRS?

152
00:22:15,400 --> 00:22:17,834
Know what?
Go back to the office,

153
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:21,869
file a report and then
we'll chat about art.

154
00:22:23,800 --> 00:22:25,313
A surgeon.

155
00:22:26,480 --> 00:22:29,472
Transplantology intern
in Switzerland.

156
00:22:29,840 --> 00:22:31,751
Gynecologist by trade.

157
00:22:32,920 --> 00:22:34,558
Doing well?

158
00:22:34,920 --> 00:22:38,196
Relax, I'm a taxi driver.

159
00:22:39,440 --> 00:22:42,512
I was driving a girl
around town last night.

160
00:22:42,840 --> 00:22:46,833
She got a bit drunk, had a bit of fun
and now she's a bit pregnant?

161
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:50,749
So, when she's more pregnant
then come back to me.

162
00:22:52,440 --> 00:22:54,590
No! Not her.
Another one.

163
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:58,350
She ended up in your hospital
without a kidney.

164
00:22:58,880 --> 00:23:01,474
During your shift.

165
00:23:02,120 --> 00:23:03,917
You know what?

166
00:23:05,880 --> 00:23:06,869
Excuse me.

167
00:23:07,360 --> 00:23:11,990
In the meantime you can have
a drink, unless you're driving again.

168
00:23:33,320 --> 00:23:37,359
So? You bought that bullshit?

169
00:23:39,040 --> 00:23:43,477
An international gang kidnaps
Polish students

170
00:23:44,120 --> 00:23:46,031
and chops them up?

171
00:23:47,320 --> 00:23:50,835
Why Polish?
Cause they're healthy?

172
00:23:51,160 --> 00:23:53,355
What for? Why?

173
00:23:53,920 --> 00:23:56,878
6,000 people die
a year in accidents.

174
00:23:57,240 --> 00:23:59,515
What's the point of kidnapping?

175
00:23:59,840 --> 00:24:03,071
Only some people
are suitable to be donors.

176
00:24:03,440 --> 00:24:05,590
The others are just pork chops.

177
00:24:05,960 --> 00:24:08,349
You can't just randomly
kidnapp people.

178
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:12,554
A donor has to have the right blood
type and at least five antibodies.

179
00:24:12,920 --> 00:24:16,913
You can't just go to a club and cut
out a kidney of any girl.

180
00:24:17,280 --> 00:24:18,474
That's ridiculous!

181
00:24:18,840 --> 00:24:21,832
She died because you transferred
the wrong type of blood.

182
00:24:22,200 --> 00:24:24,555
Didn't you even check her type?

183
00:24:24,880 --> 00:24:28,270
I did test the blood,
but yours not hers.

184
00:24:28,600 --> 00:24:32,479
You were D.U.I.
Not too shabby for a taxi driver.

185
00:24:32,840 --> 00:24:34,876
I won't cause you
any problems.

186
00:24:35,200 --> 00:24:38,749
I'll just hide this file away
as a... souvenir.

187
00:24:39,080 --> 00:24:41,389
So... get lost.

188
00:24:43,400 --> 00:24:45,516
Anyway, you have guests.

189
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,918
28 years old, single, right?

190
00:24:54,120 --> 00:24:55,678
Nice pad, huh?

191
00:24:57,480 --> 00:24:59,675
You're quite a case.

192
00:25:00,040 --> 00:25:02,508
Drug dealer, smuggler,
2 years in jail -

193
00:25:02,880 --> 00:25:06,839
accused of murder but let out
on the grounds of lack of evidence.

194
00:25:07,200 --> 00:25:12,274
So you came to the gynecologist
because your sister is pregnant?

195
00:25:12,880 --> 00:25:15,917
My friend had an accident,
she had an operation

196
00:25:16,280 --> 00:25:19,716
and somewhere along the way
her kidney disappeared.

197
00:25:20,080 --> 00:25:24,278
Sure. The Yugoslav Gang catches
people and cuts out their kidneys

198
00:25:24,640 --> 00:25:28,030
And the doctor
is covering it all up.

199
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:29,833
Mybe.

200
00:25:30,400 --> 00:25:32,072
What do you make of it?

201
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:37,719
Looks like the girl is injured
so you came to the doctor

202
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:43,393
with an offer: either a few bucks
or you'll have problems.

203
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,352
And that is called

204
00:25:45,720 --> 00:25:47,438
"blackmail".

205
00:25:56,000 --> 00:25:58,673
Excuse me. Could you step out?

206
00:26:10,160 --> 00:26:12,276
Stay away from the doctor, OK?

207
00:26:12,640 --> 00:26:14,710
Is he your buddy?

208
00:26:17,360 --> 00:26:18,713
Mlecki?

209
00:26:23,840 --> 00:26:25,353
You're in deep shit.

210
00:26:28,120 --> 00:26:30,031
And don't slam the door.

211
00:26:56,560 --> 00:27:00,235
We've gotta stay here.
Let's look for a hotel.

212
00:27:14,400 --> 00:27:16,038
My shirt.

213
00:27:22,600 --> 00:27:24,511
It was their last room.

214
00:27:31,760 --> 00:27:35,150
I'm going back to Warsaw.
I'll come get you tomorrow.

215
00:28:00,040 --> 00:28:01,758
You're behind this?

216
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,192
You think I'll stay over
with someone like you?

217
00:28:08,960 --> 00:28:11,679
You'll come running
once you freeze.

218
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:48,639
The door was open.
I'm out of here.

219
00:30:51,480 --> 00:30:53,471
What are you looking for?

220
00:30:55,560 --> 00:30:59,439
Until he has proof I was drunk
he'll threaten with the Police.

221
00:30:59,800 --> 00:31:04,271
Weren't you? If they catch us
we'll... YOU'LL go to jail.

222
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:08,349
Come in with me. If they ask
you'll just say the door was open.

223
00:31:35,200 --> 00:31:37,350
Just don't touch anything.

224
00:31:52,600 --> 00:31:54,830
I've checked. It doesn't work.

225
00:33:34,160 --> 00:33:35,912
This one works!

226
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:06,238
I was already framed
for a murder once.

227
00:34:21,840 --> 00:34:25,196
So now let's wait for the doctor.

228
00:34:31,960 --> 00:34:34,997
Are you sure about this?
You know the prices?

229
00:34:39,080 --> 00:34:41,036
Yes, I know the rates.

230
00:34:43,760 --> 00:34:45,716
So Iet's not bargain.

231
00:34:46,080 --> 00:34:47,991
I need cash, fast.

232
00:34:48,720 --> 00:34:50,119
How much?

233
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,159
For my kidney...

234
00:34:55,880 --> 00:34:58,235
I want 1 5,000.

235
00:36:23,360 --> 00:36:25,590
It's called the "rape drug".

236
00:36:26,800 --> 00:36:31,191
I could do anything with you
and you wouldn't remember a thing.

237
00:36:33,560 --> 00:36:36,438
One of your friends
drugged me with it.

238
00:36:40,720 --> 00:36:42,517
Mybe the Swiss guys?

239
00:36:43,840 --> 00:36:46,035
How well do you know
your friends?

240
00:36:46,400 --> 00:36:50,951
And OIa? She wanted to sell
her kidney for o1 5,000.

241
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:55,434
Maybe she had some issues?
She's your friend, right?

242
00:36:55,800 --> 00:36:57,518
OIa was wild.

243
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,917
But maybe it wasn't
her kidney she wanted to sell.

244
00:37:01,240 --> 00:37:04,312
Then whose? Yours?

245
00:37:04,680 --> 00:37:08,912
Think. Which one of them
could have tried to do me in?

246
00:37:09,280 --> 00:37:12,875
For now don't tell them
about OIa, ok?

247
00:37:22,280 --> 00:37:23,474
Hi.

248
00:37:31,320 --> 00:37:33,311
Are you going to the bar?

249
00:37:35,200 --> 00:37:37,509
Two beers for me!

250
00:37:39,000 --> 00:37:40,399
A chocolate bar!

251
00:38:17,440 --> 00:38:19,431
Paulina, upstairs as usual.

252
00:38:50,120 --> 00:38:52,076
The power's out.

253
00:40:17,920 --> 00:40:19,717
Good morning.

254
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:26,477
- Who's got cash?
- Probably no one.

255
00:40:26,840 --> 00:40:29,798
Stand on the corner
and make a few bucks.

256
00:40:50,360 --> 00:40:51,873
Two handles, please.

257
00:40:54,200 --> 00:40:56,270
and two boxes
of condoms.

258
00:40:56,640 --> 00:41:00,679
- That'll last you five years.
- They're rubbers not rubber bands.

259
00:41:21,840 --> 00:41:23,432
Quiet. Settle down.

260
00:41:25,000 --> 00:41:26,877
Give me a first aid kit!

261
00:41:51,680 --> 00:41:55,070
Teletubbies say bye, bye...

262
00:42:02,960 --> 00:42:06,077
I'll wait for Ola. Anyone know
where she is? Mrta?

263
00:42:06,440 --> 00:42:07,998
Did you call her?

264
00:42:09,080 --> 00:42:12,516
- When are we going to tell'em?
- What can we tell them?

265
00:42:14,240 --> 00:42:18,279
You know them better.
Ola's dead, they'll get that.

266
00:42:18,600 --> 00:42:20,272
Unless they're immortal.

267
00:42:20,600 --> 00:42:24,388
I had an accident. I just want
to know who laced my drink.

268
00:42:25,280 --> 00:42:28,317
Mybe those Swiss guys
Agata brought along?

269
00:42:28,680 --> 00:42:31,240
Agata? Have you known her long?

270
00:42:31,600 --> 00:42:35,798
- Forever. She's my best friend.
- And that fake blond guy?

271
00:42:36,120 --> 00:42:39,351
Did you see how much
he snorted? Mybe him?

272
00:42:39,880 --> 00:42:43,668
Pawel has two joys in life:
picking up girls and snorting coke.

273
00:42:45,520 --> 00:42:49,274
Don't you get it? Your "friend"
is going downhill.

274
00:42:49,960 --> 00:42:52,190
He's got debts.
Mybe he's being blackmailed?

275
00:42:52,560 --> 00:42:55,438
Or you really were drunk and
you're looking for someone to blame.

276
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:57,358
And the doctor?

277
00:42:57,720 --> 00:43:00,951
Mybe he felt bad
and couldn't take it any more.

278
00:43:28,240 --> 00:43:30,310
So, how do you feel?

279
00:43:31,040 --> 00:43:34,828
Mybe I should go to emergency
to get some shots?

280
00:43:43,560 --> 00:43:45,835
Shit, power's out again!

281
00:43:57,040 --> 00:43:58,917
Take the candle. Let's go.

282
00:44:35,800 --> 00:44:37,597
The pump!

283
00:44:40,000 --> 00:44:41,353
Dammit!

284
00:44:44,840 --> 00:44:46,876
There's someone here.

285
00:44:53,400 --> 00:44:54,515
Holy shit!

286
00:45:09,520 --> 00:45:12,876
I tried to catch the bastard
but he punched me.

287
00:45:22,760 --> 00:45:25,797
Do you always have to
think of yourself?

288
00:45:26,160 --> 00:45:30,870
Who am I supposed to think of?
Who's going to think of me, you?

289
00:45:31,600 --> 00:45:34,751
You were going to tell us
about Ola. Where is she?

290
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:38,396
What should I know about
a chick I've never even laid?

291
00:45:38,760 --> 00:45:43,038
What a prick.
And I thought you were cool.

292
00:45:53,680 --> 00:45:58,708
Just cause we hang out doesn't
mean we're "friends" yet.

293
00:45:59,080 --> 00:46:01,719
Ever wondered why you've
never been to my place?

294
00:46:03,840 --> 00:46:06,559
Never mind.
It's not about me.

295
00:46:06,920 --> 00:46:10,276
Listen, it's like this.
For Ola to be in Warsaw

296
00:46:10,640 --> 00:46:12,710
she has her dad working two shifts,

297
00:46:13,080 --> 00:46:15,674
her mom sold her insurance policy

298
00:46:16,600 --> 00:46:18,875
and Ola probably flips
burgers at night.

299
00:46:19,240 --> 00:46:21,196
Jesus, I'm gonna start balling
in a sec.

300
00:46:22,320 --> 00:46:25,949
Why is it that each of us
has been hit or injured?

301
00:46:28,240 --> 00:46:31,949
Well, not everyone. You and Mrta
are still in one piece.

302
00:46:32,280 --> 00:46:34,794
Is someone hunting us down?

303
00:46:35,120 --> 00:46:39,238
Seems like someone here
knows, what's going on.

304
00:46:39,880 --> 00:46:41,950
Why did Ola want
to sell her kidney?

305
00:46:42,320 --> 00:46:43,833
Dude, are you kidding?

306
00:46:44,200 --> 00:46:46,839
We're not gonna believe that
a law student had no choice

307
00:46:47,200 --> 00:46:49,316
but to chop herself up
to pay off debts.

308
00:46:49,680 --> 00:46:52,194
I don't have anything
to do with this.

309
00:46:52,560 --> 00:46:55,916
That's it. I have to go.
There is a girl waiting.

310
00:46:56,240 --> 00:46:59,869
So: "love you,
arrive derci, bye bye"

311
00:47:00,240 --> 00:47:01,673
See ya!

312
00:47:12,600 --> 00:47:14,079
What's going on?

313
00:47:25,640 --> 00:47:29,030
I wanted to write an article
about something important.

314
00:47:29,400 --> 00:47:31,550
Issues that are kept secret.

315
00:47:31,920 --> 00:47:36,198
But sales count. They want stuff
about pedophiles, prostitutes.

316
00:47:36,520 --> 00:47:39,557
Not about some poor family
on the block.

317
00:47:40,920 --> 00:47:42,797
So I found it.

318
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:46,514
- Organ trade?
- Yes.

319
00:47:48,480 --> 00:47:51,552
It happens everywhere:
in Russia, China, Romania,

320
00:47:52,200 --> 00:47:56,830
but in Poland it's hush-hush.
I wanted to check it out.

321
00:47:57,840 --> 00:48:00,559
Ola wanted to help.

322
00:48:01,920 --> 00:48:03,797
- For money?
- Please!

323
00:48:04,160 --> 00:48:06,628
I promised her a few bucks
for an ad.

324
00:48:07,000 --> 00:48:09,719
She met with some guy,
set a price.

325
00:48:10,040 --> 00:48:13,032
Then she was supposed
to tell him she's pregnant

326
00:48:13,400 --> 00:48:15,391
and is cutting off the deal.

327
00:48:16,800 --> 00:48:19,553
But he didn't back off.

328
00:48:21,640 --> 00:48:25,599
Ola took drugs, so she couldn't
show her own blood tests.

329
00:48:26,960 --> 00:48:29,190
So whose results were they?

330
00:48:31,000 --> 00:48:32,672
I don't know.

331
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:34,593
Really.

332
00:48:38,840 --> 00:48:42,958
She just found out how they
do it and for how much.

333
00:48:43,320 --> 00:48:44,639
That's it.

334
00:48:49,400 --> 00:48:51,960
Can you... show me the video?

335
00:48:56,200 --> 00:48:57,633
I can't do it.

336
00:48:57,960 --> 00:49:02,078
I know my kidney is the last resort
for someone out there

337
00:49:02,440 --> 00:49:05,159
but I can't risk it.

338
00:49:05,880 --> 00:49:07,518
I want kids someday.

339
00:49:10,480 --> 00:49:12,914
Can I have my tests back?

340
00:49:44,040 --> 00:49:45,758
Wanna smoke up?

341
00:49:46,080 --> 00:49:47,718
Roll one.

342
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:20,518
How long have
we known each other?

343
00:50:21,600 --> 00:50:23,591
About ten years.

344
00:50:29,160 --> 00:50:31,310
You pulled me out of prison.

345
00:50:32,200 --> 00:50:33,519
Well...

346
00:50:34,920 --> 00:50:36,911
it cost a bit.

347
00:50:40,400 --> 00:50:42,789
And now I messed up your car.

348
00:50:47,400 --> 00:50:51,712
Are you softening up on me? I helped
you out, that's what friends are for.

349
00:51:07,440 --> 00:51:10,830
- Whose place is this?
- Remember the girl from the party?

350
00:51:11,200 --> 00:51:13,111
This is her place?

351
00:51:14,560 --> 00:51:16,994
How much is she selling it for?

352
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,358
She's not.

353
00:51:23,600 --> 00:51:28,628
Everything's for sale, you just
have to know for how much.

354
00:51:30,560 --> 00:51:33,393
I'll show you something.

355
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:48,872
Do you know her?

356
00:51:49,240 --> 00:51:51,959
No,
but I'd love to get to know her.

357
00:52:04,880 --> 00:52:07,678
Let's go for a ride.

358
00:52:22,480 --> 00:52:26,155
It was supposed to be
a regular deal. She wanted to sell.

359
00:52:26,880 --> 00:52:29,678
And the Swiss guy
wanted to buy.

360
00:52:33,280 --> 00:52:37,512
She showed the blood tests, which,
as it turned out, were not hers.

361
00:52:38,600 --> 00:52:40,636
The car crash was your idea

362
00:52:41,000 --> 00:52:43,639
as a cover-up
for the operation?

363
00:52:44,400 --> 00:52:49,076
They drugged me
and you crashed the car.

364
00:52:51,000 --> 00:52:54,629
And they hospitalized
the girl to remove her kidney?

365
00:52:55,000 --> 00:52:58,390
Why are you so sensitive
all of the sudden, man?

366
00:52:58,760 --> 00:53:02,673
Did you forget how many
people are after your ass?

367
00:53:03,000 --> 00:53:05,560
You're in this just
as much as the rest of us.

368
00:53:05,880 --> 00:53:07,757
Why did the doctor kill himself?

369
00:53:08,120 --> 00:53:09,633
Did he?

370
00:53:12,760 --> 00:53:15,274
I'm scared for the first time.

371
00:53:15,640 --> 00:53:19,235
The Swiss guy sent the two
you took around the clubs.

372
00:53:19,600 --> 00:53:22,478
The are pros.
Scared of nothing.

373
00:53:22,840 --> 00:53:24,717
What are they looking for?

374
00:53:25,040 --> 00:53:30,433
That chick... they were going abroad
to work and had blood tests.

375
00:53:32,080 --> 00:53:35,311
One had a very rare
blood type, AB Rh-,

376
00:53:35,640 --> 00:53:38,632
but the Swiss
didn't know which one.

377
00:53:39,000 --> 00:53:42,072
They're safe for now.

378
00:53:42,600 --> 00:53:46,434
Noone's gonna let themselves be tested
in the middle of the street.

379
00:53:49,680 --> 00:53:50,715
Pawel?

380
00:54:12,160 --> 00:54:13,991
What a weird smell.

381
00:54:14,840 --> 00:54:17,195
So sweet. Is it a pipe?

382
00:54:18,760 --> 00:54:20,671
It's a joint, kid.

383
00:54:23,080 --> 00:54:25,548
I'm 16 and I'm not a kid.

384
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,115
You're right.

385
00:54:35,240 --> 00:54:39,631
I smoke cigarettes too,
but my dad doesn't know yet.

386
00:54:41,280 --> 00:54:43,510
Better don't let him know.

387
00:54:44,280 --> 00:54:46,157
Let me have a drag.

388
00:55:00,240 --> 00:55:02,356
I don't like filterless.

389
00:55:04,080 --> 00:55:06,355
Where are mom and dad?

390
00:55:06,680 --> 00:55:08,955
They're paying for the room.

391
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,830
You have a long history.

392
00:55:23,480 --> 00:55:25,152
What are they doing?

393
00:55:30,800 --> 00:55:32,358
Nothing.

394
00:55:38,320 --> 00:55:41,517
- What do we do?
- What should we get them on?

395
00:55:43,800 --> 00:55:45,950
Ever shot at someone?

396
00:55:54,000 --> 00:55:57,276
Get out, smile politely,

397
00:55:59,560 --> 00:56:01,630
return the l.D.

398
00:56:03,840 --> 00:56:06,115
and wish them well.

399
00:56:08,520 --> 00:56:10,829
The guy is wanted.

400
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:17,631
He killed someone.

401
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,992
What do we do?

402
00:56:21,960 --> 00:56:25,157
They probably added
something new to your resume.

403
00:57:00,440 --> 00:57:04,035
He's a bodyguard not my dad.
He never leaves my side.

404
00:57:05,440 --> 00:57:06,759
You know what?

405
00:57:08,200 --> 00:57:10,998
It'd be easy to lose him here.

406
00:57:13,520 --> 00:57:17,229
Go to the pool, through
the girl's bathroom into the yard

407
00:57:19,480 --> 00:57:21,835
and then go wherever you want.

408
00:57:22,160 --> 00:57:25,311
He's not going to go
into the girl's bathroom, is he?

409
00:57:25,680 --> 00:57:28,478
How do you know that way out?

410
00:57:28,840 --> 00:57:32,913
I come here every year
and score girls like you.

411
00:57:34,640 --> 00:57:38,076
You're going to want
to break away too, aren't you?

412
00:57:38,880 --> 00:57:40,757
That's why I came here.

413
00:57:43,320 --> 00:57:46,118
You know what I'm talking about?

414
00:57:46,440 --> 00:57:49,432
F-U-C-K-l-N-G.

415
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:51,713
Fucking.

416
00:57:54,800 --> 00:57:56,995
Let me have another drag.

417
00:57:57,760 --> 00:57:59,876
But so that he doesn't see.

418
00:58:32,200 --> 00:58:34,031
Why did he have to die?

419
00:58:34,360 --> 00:58:37,796
We're exploring the mysterious
death of 22 year old Kamil.

420
00:58:38,120 --> 00:58:41,351
The 2nd autopsy showed
a missing kidney.

421
00:58:41,720 --> 00:58:43,153
Kamil's mother

422
00:58:43,520 --> 00:58:46,637
claims that her son died
at the hands of organ dealers.

423
00:58:47,000 --> 00:58:49,275
The prosecutors are dropping
the case

424
00:58:49,600 --> 00:58:53,752
considering evidence that Kamil
died in a car accident.

425
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:10,234
Pawel?!

426
00:59:10,600 --> 00:59:14,434
I'm visiting hotel suites.
Later. See ya.

427
00:59:14,840 --> 00:59:17,070
And where are the 'rents?

428
00:59:17,400 --> 00:59:21,552
They're on the other side
of the lake with their friends.

429
00:59:21,920 --> 00:59:25,310
My dad's going to be drunk,
and mom's going to be pissed off.

430
00:59:25,680 --> 00:59:27,159
But that's tomorrow.

431
00:59:27,520 --> 00:59:29,397
Any ideas?

432
00:59:34,320 --> 00:59:36,390
That's what I thought.

433
00:59:37,560 --> 00:59:40,393
If you try,
I might surprise you.

434
00:59:45,720 --> 00:59:48,154
Then this is for you.

435
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,235
Take a bath.
I'll mix some drinks.

436
01:00:26,760 --> 01:00:29,797
You don't like the scent
of a real man?

437
01:00:44,360 --> 01:00:46,078
Wanna get in?

438
01:00:51,240 --> 01:00:54,471
I have a surprise for you.
You'll enjoy it.

439
01:01:27,560 --> 01:01:30,950
Give me the keys.
I left mine in the room.

440
01:01:32,680 --> 01:01:33,749
Thanks.

441
01:02:21,920 --> 01:02:24,559
I told you you'd go back
to the slammer.

442
01:02:47,920 --> 01:02:50,036
You don't believe it?

443
01:02:50,920 --> 01:02:55,198
That in Poland they cut out kidneys
for a mere 100 thousand dollars?

444
01:03:07,600 --> 01:03:11,513
I'll be back as soon as possible.
The boys should be here any minute.

445
01:03:17,840 --> 01:03:19,068
Bye.

446
01:04:55,280 --> 01:04:58,431
- Don't move.
- Easy, I'm Artur.

447
01:05:00,200 --> 01:05:01,997
Who cares!

448
01:05:05,480 --> 01:05:06,993
Sit down!

449
01:05:07,560 --> 01:05:09,437
I said sit down!

450
01:05:14,720 --> 01:05:16,472
What are you doing here?

451
01:05:16,840 --> 01:05:18,910
We've met. Through Szymon.

452
01:05:19,280 --> 01:05:22,192
- What are you doing in my house?
- I'll explain

453
01:05:22,560 --> 01:05:25,199
just put the pitchfork down.
I work with Szymon.

454
01:05:25,560 --> 01:05:29,030
- Where?
- Not that shithole he's at now.

455
01:05:29,400 --> 01:05:33,313
We used to smuggle stuff.
He's worried about you.

456
01:05:33,680 --> 01:05:36,797
- Then why didn't he come himself?
- Call and ask him.

457
01:05:37,160 --> 01:05:39,833
- He asked me to come.
- You broke in here.

458
01:05:40,200 --> 01:05:43,476
The door was open so I thought
I'd wait inside. Can I get up?

459
01:05:43,840 --> 01:05:44,829
No!

460
01:05:45,200 --> 01:05:46,792
I'm calling the police!

461
01:05:47,120 --> 01:05:49,793
- Szymon won't be happy.
- What do I care?

462
01:05:50,120 --> 01:05:52,839
- You've got problems too.
- Sit and don't move.

463
01:05:53,200 --> 01:05:55,316
Remember the Swiss guys?

464
01:05:56,720 --> 01:05:58,392
They're back.

465
01:06:00,600 --> 01:06:02,636
And they're at the lake.

466
01:06:03,520 --> 01:06:06,398
- How do you know?
- Let's talk

467
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:09,718
- before you call the police.
- One more move...

468
01:06:13,120 --> 01:06:15,588
Scared? I am, too.

469
01:07:26,560 --> 01:07:28,551
Give me more light.

470
01:07:50,120 --> 01:07:51,838
Mrta! Relax.

471
01:07:52,200 --> 01:07:54,156
It's me, Rafal.
Remember?

472
01:07:54,960 --> 01:07:58,396
- Show me your face.
- I'm an Europol police officer.

473
01:07:58,760 --> 01:08:00,637
Show me your face!

474
01:08:06,760 --> 01:08:08,637
Turn around!

475
01:08:09,880 --> 01:08:13,077
I'm Rafal Morr.
Trust me.

476
01:14:57,680 --> 01:15:00,797
Easy, I know what it is.

477
01:15:51,040 --> 01:15:53,600
Excuse me, can you smoke here?

478
01:17:43,520 --> 01:17:45,238
So who were they?

479
01:17:45,600 --> 01:17:48,558
Police from Europol,
with real l.D.'s.

480
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:51,678
But we'll never know
who they worked for.

481
01:18:02,160 --> 01:18:05,197
I was just going to wake you up.
Come on.

482
01:18:49,720 --> 01:18:51,278
The nurse?

483
01:18:57,080 --> 01:19:00,390
Nope. One of the best surgeons
in the country

484
01:19:00,760 --> 01:19:04,548
who had her license
revoked two years ago.

485
01:20:05,560 --> 01:20:09,917
Are you starting a healthy life
with a morning jog?

486
01:20:21,520 --> 01:20:26,799
You partied while I was attacked,
robbed and almost raped.

487
01:20:32,680 --> 01:20:34,910
I am not telling you anything.

488
01:20:35,560 --> 01:20:38,552
You guys wouldn't be able
to sympathize

489
01:20:38,880 --> 01:20:40,757
with a person with shit luck.

490
01:20:41,960 --> 01:20:43,996
Who am I talking to, anyway.

491
01:20:45,920 --> 01:20:49,469
I'm afraid of my own shadow.
I don't fly because of terrorists,

492
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:53,116
I don't go to clubs cause
the security will beat me up.

493
01:20:53,440 --> 01:20:57,558
- I can't get laid because of AlDS.
- That underaged girl did this to you?

494
01:20:58,880 --> 01:21:02,429
What a fucked up world we live in.

495
01:21:52,800 --> 01:21:54,358
Drive.

496
01:22:07,400 --> 01:22:10,870
I'll take down your report
and then...

497
01:22:12,320 --> 01:22:14,834
go on your way.

498
01:23:20,960 --> 01:23:23,474
