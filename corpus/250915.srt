1
00:02:14,667 --> 00:02:17,158
From the karate championships
at the Stardust...

2
00:02:17,370 --> 00:02:19,531
you know him as Oharra
from "Enter the Dragon"...

3
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:23,197
please welcome our celebrity
announcer, master Bob Wall.

4
00:02:23,576 --> 00:02:27,205
Ladies and gentlemen, this will
be an exhibition fight.

5
00:02:27,413 --> 00:02:32,316
The challenger, local kung-fu
favorite, Jack Tanaka.

6
00:02:37,257 --> 00:02:41,591
And the champion, dewey
"the black cobra" cooper.

7
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:40,451
-Hi, dad.
-Hi, son.

8
00:03:40,653 --> 00:03:43,622
You were good tonight
but uh, a little off...

9
00:03:46,526 --> 00:03:48,084
Thanks, Erik.

10
00:03:49,195 --> 00:03:50,355
Where's Brad?

11
00:03:52,165 --> 00:03:55,191
Son, Brad did
not want to come.

12
00:03:59,405 --> 00:04:03,899
There's a lovely young lady
I brought that I want you to meet.

13
00:04:04,110 --> 00:04:06,169
I'm just not ready
to meet anybody.

14
00:04:08,681 --> 00:04:10,410
I'm just not ready.

15
00:04:12,952 --> 00:04:14,977
Alright...

16
00:04:36,943 --> 00:04:38,672
I'm going in...

17
00:04:43,283 --> 00:04:44,648
-What was that?
-A moth.

18
00:04:44,851 --> 00:04:47,046
Your a/v enhancement
was set too high.

19
00:04:47,253 --> 00:04:49,118
I'm pickin' up
several targets.

20
00:04:49,322 --> 00:04:51,017
Move in.

21
00:04:52,859 --> 00:04:54,918
Feels like a trap.

22
00:05:48,548 --> 00:05:51,073
My family's got money.

23
00:05:51,284 --> 00:05:52,979
Please, don't kill me.
Please, don't kill me.

24
00:06:01,661 --> 00:06:03,754
Why'd you turn off the program?
I almost had 'em.

25
00:06:05,064 --> 00:06:07,089
Everything is fine Dean...

26
00:06:07,333 --> 00:06:11,133
Uh... however,
the hostage is dead.

27
00:06:13,740 --> 00:06:15,503
It's a good thing
it was a simulation.

28
00:06:15,708 --> 00:06:17,676
Oh, it's much more than that.

29
00:06:17,877 --> 00:06:22,007
We're trying to make the simulation
as real as possible.

30
00:06:22,515 --> 00:06:24,642
I see you killed
the hostage again.

31
00:06:24,851 --> 00:06:28,548
Well ya know, I keep screwin' up
just so I can come back and see you.

32
00:06:29,088 --> 00:06:31,318
But you're still not good
with computers.

33
00:06:31,524 --> 00:06:34,618
I just can't put my faith in this
new technology, you know.

34
00:06:34,827 --> 00:06:38,285
I don't have a PHD
in computer science like you.

35
00:06:39,799 --> 00:06:42,529
Well,
professor Tanaka has four...

36
00:06:42,735 --> 00:06:45,260
So I think
you're in good hands.

37
00:06:46,272 --> 00:06:48,069
That's right Dean...

38
00:06:48,274 --> 00:06:50,242
this new program
that we've developed...

39
00:06:50,443 --> 00:06:53,344
is so advanced that soon
most of your training...

40
00:06:53,546 --> 00:06:57,414
will be done here in the lab, facing
computer generated opponents.

41
00:06:57,617 --> 00:06:59,175
Come on, you can't replace...

42
00:07:00,286 --> 00:07:02,686
real opponents or real targets.

43
00:07:03,289 --> 00:07:05,052
I wouldn't be too sure of that.

44
00:07:05,391 --> 00:07:08,656
These computer
generated fighters...

45
00:07:09,128 --> 00:07:11,619
have been programmed
to respond, adapt...

46
00:07:11,831 --> 00:07:14,322
and learn any movement
they can encounter.

47
00:07:14,534 --> 00:07:16,764
Ya know pretty soon they might
be able to think on their own...

48
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,766
I'll believe that when I see it.

49
00:07:18,971 --> 00:07:22,907
This program is going to prepare you
for the ultimate confrontation...

50
00:07:23,109 --> 00:07:25,669
whether it be astreet punk
or fighter or terrorist.

51
00:07:26,813 --> 00:07:30,249
-It could save your life!
-You're probably right, doc.

52
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,044
I guess I'm still just
a little old fashioned.

53
00:07:33,252 --> 00:07:36,619
There's a lot to be said about
being old fashioned that's good...

54
00:07:36,956 --> 00:07:41,484
but I believe that eventually
the man, and not the machine...

55
00:07:42,161 --> 00:07:44,652
can ultimately make
the difference...

56
00:07:45,131 --> 00:07:49,329
...isn't that what I was saying?
-Here go clean yourself up...

57
00:07:53,139 --> 00:07:55,198
Doin' anything tonight?

58
00:07:55,541 --> 00:07:58,772
Yeah... I'm studying
for my second PHD...

59
00:08:02,381 --> 00:08:04,144
Great...

60
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:31,209
Yeah, that's a good
snap there. Put a little more...

61
00:08:31,410 --> 00:08:35,437
there you go.
Tighten that up. Good.

62
00:08:40,953 --> 00:08:43,353
Class, over here. Break.

63
00:08:56,302 --> 00:08:59,760
Okay, class remember... relax
as you go through your moves.

64
00:08:59,972 --> 00:09:02,941
Because when you tense up,
you're fighting two people...

65
00:09:03,209 --> 00:09:08,112
yourself and your opponent.
Everybody understand?

66
00:09:08,314 --> 00:09:10,475
Okay, ceremonial bow. Hut!

67
00:09:11,817 --> 00:09:13,682
Class dismissed.

68
00:10:08,741 --> 00:10:12,609
-You still workin' on the game?
-Oh, hi Sally. I'm almost through...

69
00:10:13,779 --> 00:10:16,646
Well just a few more
tweaks and adjustments...

70
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:19,340
and uh SCl-Fighter
will be completed...

71
00:10:19,552 --> 00:10:21,247
SCl-Fighter...

72
00:10:22,021 --> 00:10:25,013
I like it! How'd you
come up with that one?

73
00:10:25,257 --> 00:10:27,487
I... I think it's
the perfect name.

74
00:10:27,860 --> 00:10:29,885
SCl-Fighter...

75
00:10:31,030 --> 00:10:36,332
where modern science meets
the ancient art of self-defense.

76
00:10:36,602 --> 00:10:39,002
I think Brad's going to love it.

77
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:42,930
Not if you're late for
his birthday party.

78
00:10:45,978 --> 00:10:50,745
Oh geez... I always lose
track of time...

79
00:10:50,983 --> 00:10:53,110
It's past nine.

80
00:10:54,520 --> 00:10:56,511
I've gotta get going.

81
00:10:57,523 --> 00:10:59,616
Sally, oh... uh please will you...

82
00:10:59,825 --> 00:11:01,816
shut off the computer and pack
the game up for me please...

83
00:11:02,028 --> 00:11:04,690
Alright, okay. Go get ready...
I'll take care of everything.

84
00:11:27,053 --> 00:11:29,681
Well Sally...
how do I look?

85
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,958
You look great.

86
00:11:51,243 --> 00:11:53,006
Relax.

87
00:11:53,379 --> 00:11:54,505
How am I supposed to relax?

88
00:11:54,714 --> 00:11:56,409
Look how many people are here.
My dad's going to kill me!

89
00:12:03,089 --> 00:12:07,458
Well, since it's your birthday,
I got you a really special gift...

90
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,057
Here, careful with it.
Don't get it wet.

91
00:12:12,932 --> 00:12:16,834
Ha how'd you get these? Alright,
concert tickets for this Friday!

92
00:12:17,336 --> 00:12:19,600
-Thank you.
-Happy birthday.

93
00:12:23,275 --> 00:12:25,709
-You want some?
-You know I don't drink.

94
00:12:28,581 --> 00:12:30,742
Come on, just one sip.

95
00:12:54,640 --> 00:12:56,335
Brad.

96
00:12:56,575 --> 00:12:57,769
Brad!

97
00:13:00,679 --> 00:13:02,738
-Sr. Tanaka, I'm so...
-Don't waste your time...

98
00:13:02,948 --> 00:13:05,473
-Brad was..
-Don't waste your time!

99
00:13:07,086 --> 00:13:09,680
I want everybody
out of here now!

100
00:13:25,704 --> 00:13:27,467
Does this look ok to you?

101
00:13:33,512 --> 00:13:35,605
Looks good.
Except for this code...

102
00:13:36,882 --> 00:13:40,648
-It's a fragment.
-I missed that.

103
00:13:41,053 --> 00:13:43,578
-Good job though.
-Thanks.

104
00:13:44,490 --> 00:13:48,620
Hey. I heard you met
doctor Tanaka's son.

105
00:13:48,861 --> 00:13:50,761
Is he hot?

106
00:13:52,398 --> 00:13:56,198
Well I haven't really met him
but I saw him fight...

107
00:13:56,402 --> 00:13:58,927
and he looks really,
really cute!

108
00:14:06,445 --> 00:14:08,413
Brad, Brad!

109
00:14:09,215 --> 00:14:11,649
Sit down,
I want to talk to you.

110
00:14:13,686 --> 00:14:15,916
Sit down.

111
00:14:19,525 --> 00:14:21,220
What's gotten
into you lately?

112
00:14:23,295 --> 00:14:24,819
Is this going to take long?

113
00:14:28,234 --> 00:14:29,929
Answer me, Brad.

114
00:14:30,135 --> 00:14:33,400
Look, I know there's a problem.
I want to know what it is.

115
00:14:35,107 --> 00:14:38,736
-You wouldn't understand.
-Try me.

116
00:14:45,451 --> 00:14:46,679
Okay...

117
00:14:46,886 --> 00:14:48,217
go to your room.

118
00:14:49,121 --> 00:14:51,646
You're grounded for a week.

119
00:15:03,168 --> 00:15:04,157
Damn.

120
00:15:22,922 --> 00:15:25,152
-Hello.
-Yeah, hi. Jess?

121
00:15:25,357 --> 00:15:30,124
Hey, Brad. Oh, I'm so sorry about
getting you into trouble tonight.

122
00:15:30,729 --> 00:15:33,129
Don't worry about it. He's being
a jerk. It's not your fault.

123
00:15:33,332 --> 00:15:36,495
Yeah, but I know
that beer didn't help.

124
00:15:38,137 --> 00:15:41,573
So, um, aren't you excited about
the concert this weekend?

125
00:15:43,108 --> 00:15:44,803
Um, actually
that's why I called you.

126
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:49,777
-Yeah?What do you mean?
-I can't go. I'm grounded.

127
00:15:51,183 --> 00:15:55,415
Well, we can sneak out.

128
00:15:55,854 --> 00:16:00,018
-I would, but he took the tickets.
-You let him take the tickets?

129
00:16:00,426 --> 00:16:02,917
Brad, I've been saving up for those
tickets for the past six months.

130
00:16:03,162 --> 00:16:05,960
I know. I'm sorry. I wish there
were something I could do.

131
00:16:09,101 --> 00:16:12,332
Alright, alright. Don't worry about
it. I'll figure something out.

132
00:16:12,538 --> 00:16:14,972
-You promise?
-Yeah, I promise.

133
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:19,744
-You're not stillmad at me are you?
-No.

134
00:16:20,713 --> 00:16:23,807
-I'll see you in school, alright?
-Alright.

135
00:16:24,016 --> 00:16:26,075
-Goodnight.
-Bye.

136
00:16:34,393 --> 00:16:36,156
Come in.

137
00:16:45,471 --> 00:16:47,234
Happy birthday.

138
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,536
I got you a new kung fu uniform...

139
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:57,372
Great.

140
00:17:01,120 --> 00:17:03,145
You know, Brad, you were gonna
come back to class tonight.

141
00:17:04,890 --> 00:17:07,791
It's my birthday. I should
be able to do what I want.

142
00:17:08,627 --> 00:17:09,787
Skipping class is
one thing, but...

143
00:17:09,995 --> 00:17:12,987
what are you doing throwing a
party without asking permission?

144
00:17:13,198 --> 00:17:15,029
It's my house too, you know.

145
00:17:16,001 --> 00:17:20,665
Kung fu is not just asport
It's away of life.

146
00:17:20,873 --> 00:17:23,307
And if you would dedicate
yourself just a little bit...

147
00:17:24,643 --> 00:17:26,907
your grades
might improve too.

148
00:17:28,347 --> 00:17:30,372
Thanks for the gift, dad.

149
00:17:43,362 --> 00:17:45,057
Hello.

150
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:48,762
-Hi, Jack.
-Hi, dad. You're late...

151
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,104
you know I got carried away
at the lab, son. I'm sorry.

152
00:17:59,511 --> 00:18:01,604
The party's over?
What's going on?

153
00:18:02,648 --> 00:18:04,411
Brad missed class again.

154
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:06,982
And he threw this party,
didn't even tell me about it.

155
00:18:07,219 --> 00:18:10,120
-Son, it's his birthday.
-I caught him with a beer tonight.

156
00:18:10,422 --> 00:18:13,118
I mean, no wonder his
grades are slipping.

157
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,353
Jack, I meant to talk
to you about Brad.

158
00:18:16,562 --> 00:18:20,555
You know lately he's been a
little rebelious and acting out.

159
00:18:20,799 --> 00:18:23,063
But growing up is
a hard thing to do, son.

160
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:27,227
Especially when you lose your
mother at such an early age.

161
00:18:27,573 --> 00:18:29,234
That can be devastating.

162
00:18:29,441 --> 00:18:33,377
So try to be patient
with Brad, please.

163
00:18:33,946 --> 00:18:37,074
You don't understand, dad.
Kids are different today.

164
00:18:37,916 --> 00:18:39,781
They're not that different.

165
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:41,748
You remember you when
you were younger?

166
00:18:41,954 --> 00:18:45,583
You used to sneak out and
try to see your girlfriend...

167
00:18:47,292 --> 00:18:49,658
you used to get me in
a lot of trouble too, you know.

168
00:18:51,763 --> 00:18:54,891
I don't wish to dishonor
or disrespect the love...

169
00:18:55,100 --> 00:18:57,193
and the feeling you had
for Stephanie.

170
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:01,964
I know it's been painful. The reason
I wanted you to meet Sally...

171
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:06,638
was because she's a decent
woman. She's intelligent.

172
00:19:06,845 --> 00:19:09,211
-Now will you meet her?
-Ok, I'll meet her.

173
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:11,915
-When?
-Soon.

174
00:19:12,184 --> 00:19:14,379
Let's just go give Brad his gift.

175
00:19:14,586 --> 00:19:16,577
Oh, good Alright, uh you know.
I have an idea.

176
00:19:16,955 --> 00:19:21,085
Why don't we set it up here
and give him asurprise?

177
00:19:22,161 --> 00:19:24,095
Okay?

178
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,661
That's cool.

179
00:19:34,506 --> 00:19:36,337
What do you want now?

180
00:19:37,743 --> 00:19:39,404
What?

181
00:19:40,445 --> 00:19:41,537
Brad.

182
00:19:44,716 --> 00:19:48,652
That's a hell of away
to treat your grandfather.

183
00:19:48,921 --> 00:19:52,823
-How you doin' granpa?
-I'm doin' alright. I'm doin' alright.

184
00:19:53,425 --> 00:19:55,586
-How are you feeling?
-Alright.

185
00:20:00,065 --> 00:20:02,124
I've got something for you.

186
00:20:03,001 --> 00:20:04,093
What is it?

187
00:20:04,303 --> 00:20:06,032
Ah, it's something
I made especially for you.

188
00:20:06,238 --> 00:20:08,433
It's avideo game.
It's called SCl-Fighter.

189
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:09,971
-SCl-Fighter?
-Yes...

190
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:15,010
so come on.
I set it up in the living room.

191
00:20:15,214 --> 00:20:17,341
Go ahead, try it out.

192
00:20:23,922 --> 00:20:26,550
It's going to be alright, Jack.

193
00:20:27,092 --> 00:20:29,686
It's going to be alright, Jack.
Come on.

194
00:20:41,640 --> 00:20:43,938
Brad, put it in. Come on.

195
00:20:47,246 --> 00:20:50,773
-Are you sure this thing's safe?
-Jack, of course it's safe.

196
00:20:50,983 --> 00:20:53,076
There's nothing wrong with it.

197
00:20:58,123 --> 00:20:59,750
It's cool, uh?

198
00:21:10,636 --> 00:21:12,968
Hi, you must be Brad.

199
00:21:13,405 --> 00:21:15,168
Yeah, who are you?

200
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:17,565
Veronica.

201
00:21:18,310 --> 00:21:21,040
-Nice graphics.
-Let's see what suits you.

202
00:21:27,286 --> 00:21:28,947
Cool...

203
00:21:30,289 --> 00:21:34,089
-What's he doing in there?
-Ah, he's trying different uniforms on.

204
00:21:35,394 --> 00:21:36,861
What kind of game is this?

205
00:21:37,062 --> 00:21:40,122
It's a hand to hand combat
training simulator.

206
00:21:40,332 --> 00:21:44,234
With artificial intelligence that
can adapt and adjust itself to...

207
00:21:44,436 --> 00:21:46,097
its opponents strengths
and weaknesses...

208
00:21:46,305 --> 00:21:48,865
and provide maximum challenge.

209
00:21:49,207 --> 00:21:52,540
By the way,
I used real people as models...

210
00:21:52,744 --> 00:21:54,939
to play the computer
generated fighters.

211
00:21:55,714 --> 00:21:57,841
Come on Jack.
Go ahead, try it.

212
00:21:58,917 --> 00:21:59,941
I don't think so.

213
00:22:00,152 --> 00:22:02,245
You said you wanted
to be close to Brad.

214
00:22:02,454 --> 00:22:04,888
A family that plays
together stays together.

215
00:22:05,090 --> 00:22:08,116
-A video game?
-Yes, avideogame.

216
00:22:08,327 --> 00:22:10,261
Come on.

217
00:22:12,264 --> 00:22:16,667
Jack, I designed this game
for the both of you.

218
00:22:18,036 --> 00:22:20,834
So that you can connect.
This is an opportunity.

219
00:22:21,206 --> 00:22:23,071
Well I don't see how this
is going to help any.

220
00:22:23,275 --> 00:22:29,077
Come on. No ands or buts. Everything
isn't what it appears to be. Okay?

221
00:22:40,092 --> 00:22:43,926
-Jack I'm so glad you made it.
-You know me?

222
00:22:44,229 --> 00:22:46,254
Only what doctor
Tanaka told me...

223
00:22:47,399 --> 00:22:50,630
Iwas so looking forward
to meeting you in person.

224
00:22:50,869 --> 00:22:53,736
You are much more handsome
than I had imagined.

225
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:57,399
Thanks! Dad,
I'm sure you're enjoying this!

226
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:03,171
Maybe you'd look good
in a Shaolin monk's outfit.

227
00:23:04,549 --> 00:23:06,176
I don't think so...

228
00:23:06,718 --> 00:23:09,619
orange is definitely
not my color...

229
00:23:12,057 --> 00:23:15,618
...that's it, a superhero costume.
-No...

230
00:23:16,194 --> 00:23:18,526
...what is your name?
-Veronica.

231
00:23:21,166 --> 00:23:23,191
Veronica get this off me!

232
00:23:24,403 --> 00:23:28,339
You're a tough one to please. Ok
how 'bout something simple like this?

233
00:23:29,608 --> 00:23:33,977
-That's cool.
-This'll do.

234
00:23:34,179 --> 00:23:37,114
Then you're ready to go.
Step through the portal...

235
00:23:37,315 --> 00:23:39,840
and you'll make your way
to the first level of the game.

236
00:23:40,352 --> 00:23:41,649
Thanks.

237
00:23:41,853 --> 00:23:43,013
Jack...

238
00:23:43,221 --> 00:23:44,916
Come back
and see me sometime!

239
00:23:46,992 --> 00:23:48,892
Good luck, guys.

240
00:24:03,408 --> 00:24:05,399
I am the karate master.

241
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:09,277
If you are prepared for battle,
we can begin.

242
00:24:11,850 --> 00:24:14,410
Choose your skill level.

243
00:24:14,753 --> 00:24:16,687
Skill level?

244
00:24:18,156 --> 00:24:21,819
Yes.
Are you master or beginner?

245
00:24:22,194 --> 00:24:23,821
Master.

246
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:25,658
You better make
it beginner Brad.

247
00:24:25,864 --> 00:24:27,354
Chill out dad,
it's just a game.

248
00:24:27,999 --> 00:24:29,762
You have chosen.

249
00:24:48,753 --> 00:24:51,313
-Brad you ok?
-Yeah, I'm cool.

250
00:24:51,690 --> 00:24:52,850
Kick his ass dad!

251
00:24:53,058 --> 00:24:55,253
Time to give you
a taste of reality.

252
00:25:14,145 --> 00:25:16,113
Welcome to SCl-Fighter!

253
00:25:19,851 --> 00:25:21,614
What's the matter?

254
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,828
There's no way Brad's
playing this thing.

255
00:25:32,030 --> 00:25:34,055
Dad,
I can take care of myself.

256
00:25:34,599 --> 00:25:36,829
A game's just a game,
but that really hurt.

257
00:25:37,035 --> 00:25:38,525
You're overreacting.

258
00:25:38,737 --> 00:25:42,366
It's just adapting to your
player's skill level.

259
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:44,834
Just fix this thing
or get rid of it.

260
00:25:45,043 --> 00:25:47,705
Alright, alright, alright.
I'll fix it.

261
00:25:51,583 --> 00:25:53,847
See what I mean?
He never listens.

262
00:25:54,052 --> 00:25:56,418
Uh, I'm sorry about that Brad.

263
00:25:56,688 --> 00:25:58,588
He's such a hypocrite.

264
00:25:58,890 --> 00:26:02,519
He gets hit all the time and
he says it's part of training.

265
00:26:04,095 --> 00:26:07,587
Alright.
I'll fix it and then I will...

266
00:26:08,633 --> 00:26:10,601
I'll talk to your father.

267
00:26:11,169 --> 00:26:14,696
And I'm sure I can talk him into
letting you try the game again.

268
00:26:14,940 --> 00:26:16,805
-Deal?
-Deal.

269
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,373
Okay, deal. Good.

270
00:26:19,110 --> 00:26:20,941
Now let's see what's wrong
with this sucker here.

271
00:26:21,146 --> 00:26:24,047
SCl-Fighter
diagnostic activated.

272
00:26:32,958 --> 00:26:35,426
Your father loves
you very much.

273
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:39,119
He wants to do the best for you. I
know he's trying to understand you.

274
00:26:39,331 --> 00:26:43,358
He doesn't understand me.
He never will.

275
00:26:44,436 --> 00:26:46,336
Not like mom did.

276
00:26:54,279 --> 00:26:57,442
Your mom would be
very proud of you today.

277
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:30,379
Well, I guess it's time
to check this game out.

278
00:27:57,175 --> 00:27:59,405
Everything appears
to be normal.

279
00:28:06,751 --> 00:28:09,549
Nothing seems to be wrong
with this game.

280
00:28:17,162 --> 00:28:18,720
Program end.

281
00:28:23,234 --> 00:28:24,895
Interesting weather.

282
00:28:59,104 --> 00:29:00,696
Come on, mom.
It looks horrible.

283
00:29:00,905 --> 00:29:03,135
-It looks good!
-It looks horrible!

284
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,138
He's going to hate it.

285
00:29:07,345 --> 00:29:09,006
Brad!

286
00:29:09,781 --> 00:29:11,408
Stop.

287
00:29:19,891 --> 00:29:21,722
I love you...

288
00:29:22,460 --> 00:29:24,291
Okay, dad's going be home.

289
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:27,659
Let's get this done...
Okay, we need the candles.

290
00:29:30,335 --> 00:29:32,530
Brad, you didn't forget
the candles?

291
00:29:32,837 --> 00:29:35,101
Yeah, I'm sorry.

292
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:38,639
He's going to be home. We need to
get to the store and get back quick.

293
00:29:38,843 --> 00:29:42,040
Mom, I can't.
I'm expecting a phone call.

294
00:29:42,280 --> 00:29:44,009
Come on we need to go
to the store. It's late.

295
00:29:44,215 --> 00:29:46,649
Oooh! Come on, please?

296
00:29:47,852 --> 00:29:50,946
Okay. Clean up
and I'll be right back.

297
00:29:53,458 --> 00:29:55,221
Mom!

298
00:30:32,897 --> 00:30:34,922
Hey, Brad, where's Jack?

299
00:30:35,366 --> 00:30:36,628
He's busy.

300
00:30:36,901 --> 00:30:38,528
Oh, too bad.

301
00:30:39,170 --> 00:30:40,398
Same uniform?

302
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:43,262
Yeah!

303
00:30:58,957 --> 00:31:01,790
-Where's daddy?
-I can do this on my own.

304
00:31:02,627 --> 00:31:04,788
You are not worthy.

305
00:31:05,263 --> 00:31:06,321
Wanna bet?

306
00:31:06,531 --> 00:31:08,692
Go home and
practice little boy.

307
00:31:08,900 --> 00:31:11,425
You are not worthy
of fighting me.

308
00:31:19,377 --> 00:31:22,540
Are you sure you don't want
to go get daddy?

309
00:31:29,854 --> 00:31:33,381
Such a pity. I have to finish
this futile display.

310
00:31:53,177 --> 00:31:54,542
Brad.

311
00:31:55,346 --> 00:31:57,075
Brad, take that thing off. Aah!

312
00:32:02,487 --> 00:32:04,955
System now operating
on back-up power supply.

313
00:32:07,525 --> 00:32:09,288
What the hell is going on?

314
00:32:19,237 --> 00:32:22,365
Dad, get over here fast.
It's Brad.

315
00:32:23,641 --> 00:32:25,074
Just get over here.

316
00:32:46,631 --> 00:32:50,294
-Jack?
-Dad, it's... it's Brad.

317
00:32:50,501 --> 00:32:53,368
-What's going on?
-He was playing the game.

318
00:32:53,571 --> 00:32:56,131
I tried to take the helmet off
and I got shocked.

319
00:32:56,341 --> 00:32:59,367
It's not even plugged in.
What's happening?

320
00:32:59,978 --> 00:33:02,037
I... I don't know, son.

321
00:33:06,818 --> 00:33:12,085
His mind is trapped in the game.
You have to go into the game.

322
00:33:12,390 --> 00:33:14,517
You have to find Brad
and you must...

323
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:17,490
defeat all the fighters
and get to the last level.

324
00:33:17,695 --> 00:33:21,461
That will give me the opportunity
to transport you and Brad...

325
00:33:21,666 --> 00:33:23,065
out of the game.

326
00:33:23,267 --> 00:33:25,326
But we don't have much time.

327
00:33:25,837 --> 00:33:28,032
-I'm going in.
-Careful, Jack.

328
00:33:50,795 --> 00:33:52,626
Brad!

329
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:02,663
Brad, where are you?

330
00:34:36,140 --> 00:34:38,199
Dad! Dad, help me.

331
00:34:40,945 --> 00:34:42,242
Dad, over here.

332
00:34:56,127 --> 00:34:59,893
Sally? Sally, code black!

333
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:02,592
My worst nightmare.

334
00:35:03,701 --> 00:35:06,397
Can you please get
the recovery discs and...

335
00:35:06,671 --> 00:35:09,640
and come to Jack's house
as soon as possible?

336
00:35:10,641 --> 00:35:13,405
Yes, please.
Thank you.

337
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:20,448
Dad, over here.

338
00:35:23,221 --> 00:35:25,212
Dad, I'm over here.

339
00:35:26,424 --> 00:35:28,085
You're getting closer...

340
00:35:32,663 --> 00:35:34,528
Here I am.

341
00:35:34,765 --> 00:35:37,757
-Daddy.
-What did you do with my son?

342
00:35:38,102 --> 00:35:39,626
If you get through me...

343
00:35:39,837 --> 00:35:41,998
you just might find him.

344
00:37:04,455 --> 00:37:05,888
Where's my son?

345
00:37:06,357 --> 00:37:07,722
He's not on this level.

346
00:37:08,793 --> 00:37:10,727
I hope he's dead!

347
00:37:54,639 --> 00:37:57,631
Hello, Bradley,
it's about time you got here.

348
00:39:47,351 --> 00:39:48,841
Thank you Jack...

349
00:39:49,353 --> 00:39:52,049
-You know me?
-We all do.

350
00:39:52,256 --> 00:39:54,520
I'm the white dragon.
Why did you help me?

351
00:39:57,294 --> 00:39:59,353
You remind me of someone.

352
00:39:59,964 --> 00:40:03,923
Brad's not here. Go find him.

353
00:40:31,462 --> 00:40:33,225
-Hey, what are you doing?
-Hi, Dean.

354
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:36,566
I have to bring these
to professor Tanaka.

355
00:40:40,070 --> 00:40:41,867
You're not supposed to
take anything out of here.

356
00:40:42,573 --> 00:40:43,733
I know.

357
00:40:43,941 --> 00:40:45,738
This is an emergency.

358
00:40:50,047 --> 00:40:52,982
Okay, go out the back door.
I'll cover you.

359
00:40:54,351 --> 00:40:55,978
Thanks.

360
00:41:02,259 --> 00:41:04,250
Professor,
how did this happen?

361
00:41:34,959 --> 00:41:36,449
Brad!

362
00:41:38,229 --> 00:41:39,218
Brad!

363
00:42:57,808 --> 00:42:59,537
Jack!

364
00:43:00,110 --> 00:43:01,099
How did you get in the game?

365
00:43:01,312 --> 00:43:04,406
There's no time for that
my power's draining.

366
00:43:04,782 --> 00:43:08,616
I'm sorry son I only programmed
two fighters for this level.

367
00:43:11,221 --> 00:43:13,052
The game has learned
all your moves.

368
00:43:13,324 --> 00:43:15,758
-How do I beat these guys?
-You have to be innovative.

369
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:19,654
Use your reflexes and instincts.

370
00:43:28,138 --> 00:43:29,969
Be focused.

371
00:43:30,174 --> 00:43:33,007
Your subconscious mind
is the key.

372
00:44:10,881 --> 00:44:12,508
Well done, Jack.

373
00:44:12,716 --> 00:44:14,115
Come on!

374
00:44:14,318 --> 00:44:16,047
Come on, Jack.

375
00:44:16,353 --> 00:44:17,342
He's okay.

376
00:44:20,090 --> 00:44:21,751
Stay strong, Jack.

377
00:44:22,426 --> 00:44:23,518
Stay strong.

378
00:44:34,204 --> 00:44:35,466
What's happening?

379
00:44:35,773 --> 00:44:39,504
I'm afraid avirus has gotten into
the game. It has corrupted and...

380
00:44:39,710 --> 00:44:42,873
destroyed all
the safety codes.

381
00:44:43,080 --> 00:44:45,605
Son, you are fighting
for your life and Brad's.

382
00:44:45,816 --> 00:44:48,011
You've got to get
to the next portal.

383
00:45:09,740 --> 00:45:11,901
I'll get you this time.

384
00:45:25,255 --> 00:45:27,280
Surprise!

385
00:45:28,292 --> 00:45:30,157
Two heads are better than one.

386
00:45:30,360 --> 00:45:32,419
Dragon twins, activate.

387
00:45:42,606 --> 00:45:44,335
We'll get him this time.

388
00:45:53,050 --> 00:45:55,245
Well there's a one for the money,
two for the show.

389
00:45:57,554 --> 00:45:58,851
Here I go...

390
00:46:35,392 --> 00:46:37,690
Help! Dad!

391
00:46:40,664 --> 00:46:43,258
What have you done
to my world?

392
00:46:43,500 --> 00:46:45,934
The program's been poisoned.

393
00:46:46,837 --> 00:46:49,635
-I swear it wasn't me.
-You lie.

394
00:46:49,840 --> 00:46:53,332
You and your father are
the only new ones to the game.

395
00:47:05,389 --> 00:47:07,289
Run away, little boy...

396
00:47:07,558 --> 00:47:10,550
When you and your father return,
I'll kill you both.

397
00:48:09,453 --> 00:48:13,253
Hello, Jackie.
It's time to play.

398
00:48:25,869 --> 00:48:27,200
Ready?

399
00:48:38,615 --> 00:48:40,879
Ready?

400
00:48:45,088 --> 00:48:46,453
Got you...

401
00:48:50,360 --> 00:48:51,884
Oooh, got you now!

402
00:48:56,300 --> 00:48:59,064
Okay, Jackie,
let's see what you've got.

403
00:49:04,141 --> 00:49:07,474
Try that again! Come on. I'm
going to get you now! Look out...

404
00:49:20,257 --> 00:49:23,590
You are going to regret.
You have felt my anger.

405
00:49:28,565 --> 00:49:30,465
Alright, are you ready
to give up? Huh?

406
00:49:35,138 --> 00:49:38,539
Go. Find the boy
If you can!

407
00:49:41,011 --> 00:49:42,979
Come back when
you want some more.

408
00:49:46,984 --> 00:49:49,452
I can't get outta this place.

409
00:50:32,295 --> 00:50:34,058
Spare change?

410
00:50:40,570 --> 00:50:42,561
What are you supposed to be?

411
00:50:44,574 --> 00:50:47,338
They call me street fighter.

412
00:50:51,481 --> 00:50:54,109
My world's not
so pretty is it Jack?

413
00:51:23,914 --> 00:51:25,040
Ready for this?

414
00:51:50,941 --> 00:51:52,636
Where's my son?

415
00:51:52,943 --> 00:51:56,242
Jack, you know the rules, baby!
You gotta beat me!

416
00:52:05,622 --> 00:52:07,453
He's not here, baby.

417
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,254
Ah, not this place again!

418
00:52:30,347 --> 00:52:32,372
There's got to be a portal.

419
00:52:39,923 --> 00:52:41,413
Dad!

420
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:43,058
Dad!

421
00:52:43,793 --> 00:52:46,159
Granpa, anybody
can you hear me?

422
00:52:48,431 --> 00:52:52,993
Who am I kidding?
I'm stuck and it's all my fault.

423
00:53:09,619 --> 00:53:11,780
Pretty clever granpa.

424
00:53:18,895 --> 00:53:20,453
I'm going in.

425
00:53:25,869 --> 00:53:29,066
That's odd. It's Dean!

426
00:53:41,418 --> 00:53:43,409
A residual image from the lab.

427
00:53:44,754 --> 00:53:46,654
Please don't kill me!

428
00:53:46,856 --> 00:53:48,551
I don't want to die.

429
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:52,061
You don't have to do this. My
family's got money. We can pay you.

430
00:53:53,163 --> 00:53:54,790
Please don't kill me...
Please.

431
00:54:09,713 --> 00:54:11,510
Jack?

432
00:54:12,215 --> 00:54:13,944
Dean?

433
00:54:29,299 --> 00:54:34,066
Hey. Hey. Up here!

434
00:54:37,173 --> 00:54:40,370
-Where are you going?
-I'm looking for my son.

435
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,238
Brad.

436
00:54:43,446 --> 00:54:45,539
You're going the wrong way.

437
00:54:46,216 --> 00:54:47,911
Go this way.
Go through the tunnel.

438
00:55:22,786 --> 00:55:26,813
Not bad for a beginner.
Oh, by the way, I forgot one thing.

439
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:30,322
You gotta go through me before
you get to the next portal.

440
00:55:31,795 --> 00:55:33,660
Ha, piece of cake.

441
00:57:26,476 --> 00:57:28,444
I know why you're here.

442
00:57:28,878 --> 00:57:31,540
You're looking for
the portal to your son.

443
00:57:32,015 --> 00:57:33,915
Where's Brad?

444
00:57:35,018 --> 00:57:36,986
Now I can't tell you that.

445
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:39,847
It wouldn't be
as fun if I did.

446
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,284
Where is he?

447
00:57:47,430 --> 00:57:51,127
I hate kids Jack.
They're awaste of time!

448
00:57:51,801 --> 00:57:54,793
Brad's already interfering
in our relationship.

449
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:58,534
If it wasn't for him,
we could be.

450
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,309
Friends?

451
00:58:01,778 --> 00:58:03,905
Sorry, you're not my type.

452
00:58:18,161 --> 00:58:21,096
They call me the scorpion.

453
00:58:31,040 --> 00:58:34,237
Taste my venom, Jack.

454
00:58:43,853 --> 00:58:45,878
Where's Brad?

455
00:58:58,668 --> 00:59:00,636
I like it when you're
rough with me...

456
00:59:02,939 --> 00:59:06,033
You wouldn't hit a lady now
would you Jack?

457
00:59:08,311 --> 00:59:10,370
You hit me.

458
00:59:17,854 --> 00:59:20,880
You win Jack...
Brad's not here!

459
00:59:23,459 --> 00:59:25,393
Come back and see me sometime.

460
00:59:26,663 --> 00:59:29,996
I'd like to play a different
game with you.

461
00:59:40,543 --> 00:59:42,841
What a beautiful picture
of Brad and his mom.

462
00:59:45,214 --> 00:59:47,705
They were inseparable.

463
01:00:18,348 --> 01:00:19,508
Relax.

464
01:00:21,484 --> 01:00:23,213
No more fighting...

465
01:01:19,275 --> 01:01:20,799
Jack!

466
01:01:21,010 --> 01:01:22,705
Jack!

467
01:01:22,912 --> 01:01:24,777
-Dad...
-Jack!

468
01:01:24,981 --> 01:01:26,073
Is that you?

469
01:01:26,282 --> 01:01:27,977
Yes.

470
01:01:28,685 --> 01:01:33,122
Jack, what are you
doing, what's goingon?

471
01:01:35,291 --> 01:01:37,816
-I have to catch her.
-Who?

472
01:01:38,728 --> 01:01:40,593
The white dragon.

473
01:01:41,130 --> 01:01:44,657
Jack, she's not real Icreated her.

474
01:01:45,435 --> 01:01:49,895
You have to find Brad and get
out of here as soon as possible.

475
01:01:50,573 --> 01:01:52,370
Time is running out.

476
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:54,498
I have to find her.

477
01:01:59,816 --> 01:02:01,408
Jack...

478
01:02:01,718 --> 01:02:03,515
time is running out.

479
01:02:08,691 --> 01:02:09,919
Wake up Jack...

480
01:02:10,259 --> 01:02:11,749
wake up.

481
01:02:33,082 --> 01:02:34,913
Why did you return?

482
01:02:38,488 --> 01:02:40,547
I wanted to see you again...

483
01:02:40,923 --> 01:02:42,720
You shouldn't have
come back here...

484
01:02:42,992 --> 01:02:45,552
you have to keep moving
forward in the game...

485
01:02:46,028 --> 01:02:47,791
don't give up...

486
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:51,522
defeat all the levels
and save your son.

487
01:02:51,901 --> 01:02:53,391
But I don't want to leave you.

488
01:02:53,603 --> 01:02:55,696
Listen, listen to me Jack...

489
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,667
I'm trying to help you...

490
01:02:57,874 --> 01:02:59,774
I can't let you stay here
at this level...

491
01:03:00,676 --> 01:03:03,440
and my programming
won't allow me to go with you.

492
01:03:03,713 --> 01:03:05,578
Find your son...

493
01:03:06,048 --> 01:03:08,949
Wake up. Wake up, Jack.

494
01:03:15,525 --> 01:03:17,117
Wake up, Jack.

495
01:03:17,460 --> 01:03:19,121
Wake up.

496
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:41,006
Hey you're messin'
around with my girl friend!

497
01:03:41,217 --> 01:03:42,980
Come here.

498
01:03:43,886 --> 01:03:45,786
Lets go, Jack.

499
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:15,670
I wanna see you get
out a this one, Jack.

500
01:06:01,724 --> 01:06:03,555
Dad how did you...

501
01:06:09,532 --> 01:06:11,762
-What's wrong?
-You're what's wrong.

502
01:06:12,268 --> 01:06:16,864
You deliberately disobeyed me...
And this is what happens!

503
01:06:18,341 --> 01:06:20,502
I'm sorry... I didn't mean
for all this to happen...

504
01:06:20,743 --> 01:06:22,540
Don't apologize...

505
01:06:24,714 --> 01:06:29,947
You've always been a loser and
it's your fault your mother's dead...

506
01:06:35,191 --> 01:06:36,249
I'm sorry.

507
01:06:38,394 --> 01:06:40,419
Now that she's gone...

508
01:06:40,629 --> 01:06:43,462
I don't have to put up
with you any more.

509
01:06:45,201 --> 01:06:47,692
-Dad don't leave please
-Don't touch me...

510
01:06:49,271 --> 01:06:53,731
you disgust me.
Get outta my sight.

511
01:06:59,815 --> 01:07:01,544
Shut up.

512
01:07:11,560 --> 01:07:13,152
What did you say?

513
01:07:15,765 --> 01:07:17,699
I said shut up.

514
01:07:18,000 --> 01:07:20,298
That's no way to talk to your...

515
01:07:21,003 --> 01:07:22,061
daddy...

516
01:07:23,172 --> 01:07:25,697
You're not my father...

517
01:07:26,475 --> 01:07:30,434
my father loves me
and so did my mother.

518
01:07:31,747 --> 01:07:33,237
Go to hell!

519
01:07:35,751 --> 01:07:37,480
Brad.

520
01:07:39,355 --> 01:07:40,982
-What are you doin'?
-Get off of me.

521
01:07:41,457 --> 01:07:43,721
Brad what are you
doing it's me?

522
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:53,161
Dad?

523
01:07:54,070 --> 01:07:55,594
Are you alright?

524
01:07:57,339 --> 01:07:59,102
Yeah.

525
01:07:59,575 --> 01:08:01,202
I am now...

526
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:07,174
I love you, son.

527
01:08:09,919 --> 01:08:12,285
I think they found each other.

528
01:08:14,323 --> 01:08:16,723
We've got to get to the last level.
So we can get out of here.

529
01:08:17,126 --> 01:08:18,650
What are we supposed to do?

530
01:08:28,437 --> 01:08:29,426
Andrew Dean.

531
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:33,102
Doctor Tanaka here,
look I need your help.

532
01:08:34,110 --> 01:08:36,340
You've played the game more
than anyone else...

533
01:08:36,745 --> 01:08:40,511
can you tell me if there's a pattern
in the path to the last level?

534
01:08:41,183 --> 01:08:44,050
Well you know the path
to the last portal is randomized...

535
01:08:44,253 --> 01:08:48,019
but I've seen a pattern that depends
on the skill level of the player...

536
01:08:48,324 --> 01:08:50,690
if he's any good it will
be the middle path.

537
01:08:51,393 --> 01:08:52,758
Is there a problem doc?

538
01:08:52,962 --> 01:08:54,520
I hope not,
I hope not Dean...

539
01:08:54,797 --> 01:08:56,526
thank you very much, bye.

540
01:09:03,405 --> 01:09:05,669
-We're back on level 1...
-What's going on...

541
01:09:10,212 --> 01:09:12,077
Granpa.

542
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:16,044
Brad.

543
01:09:16,952 --> 01:09:19,682
-Jack.
-What's going on?

544
01:09:19,889 --> 01:09:22,881
The game ends
where it begins...

545
01:09:23,125 --> 01:09:27,391
and now you must find the correct
path to get to the last level.

546
01:09:30,332 --> 01:09:31,458
Which one?

547
01:09:31,867 --> 01:09:33,732
I'm not sure, son.

548
01:09:34,170 --> 01:09:37,264
The virus has corrupted
the game and...

549
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:41,170
I believe that...
You should take the middle path.

550
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,867
I don't know, dad,
I think it's this one...

551
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:48,746
Gotta go with my gut
on this one dad...

552
01:09:49,451 --> 01:09:51,112
Let's try your way then.

553
01:10:09,371 --> 01:10:11,396
I picked the wrong porthole...

554
01:10:11,607 --> 01:10:13,006
we're never gonna
get outta here alive.

555
01:10:13,742 --> 01:10:15,539
Don't give up on me Brad...

556
01:10:16,612 --> 01:10:18,978
We're gonna get outta here and
we're gonna do it together.

557
01:10:23,319 --> 01:10:25,879
Just like mom. It's all
my fault she died!

558
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,350
It was not your fault.

559
01:10:31,126 --> 01:10:32,889
A man with a knife
killed your mom...

560
01:10:33,095 --> 01:10:34,790
not you.

561
01:10:35,831 --> 01:10:37,696
We have to live up
to what she wanted for us...

562
01:10:38,867 --> 01:10:41,358
which means we have
to get out of here!

563
01:10:41,737 --> 01:10:43,466
How we gonna get out?

564
01:10:47,176 --> 01:10:49,144
I've got an idea.

565
01:10:54,250 --> 01:10:55,945
-Come on Brad...
-I can't do it!

566
01:10:56,652 --> 01:10:58,779
They're not real...
Come on...

567
01:10:58,988 --> 01:11:00,615
-They won't hurt you!
-I can't!

568
01:11:00,889 --> 01:11:02,516
You can do it Brad
they're not real...

569
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,717
Don't be afraid...

570
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:06,725
I can't do it!

571
01:11:08,097 --> 01:11:10,565
They won't hurt you trust me.

572
01:11:11,166 --> 01:11:14,101
We're running out of time,
we've got to go now.

573
01:11:14,403 --> 01:11:16,462
Do it Brad, do it.

574
01:11:29,451 --> 01:11:31,681
How do you know
they weren't real?

575
01:11:31,887 --> 01:11:35,323
I didn't but remember
what granpasaid...

576
01:11:35,524 --> 01:11:37,992
things here aren't always
what they seem to be...

577
01:11:38,193 --> 01:11:42,186
Sometimes in life son... The biggest
obstacles are just in your mind.

578
01:11:42,665 --> 01:11:44,496
Let's go!

579
01:11:53,709 --> 01:11:55,904
I guess granpawas right.

580
01:12:00,215 --> 01:12:03,514
Yeah, I guess sometimes the old guy
knows what he's talking about.

581
01:12:04,186 --> 01:12:06,017
One more fight and
we're out of here...

582
01:12:06,221 --> 01:12:08,018
everything's going
to be all right Brad.

583
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:11,293
I'll take the guys on the left...

584
01:12:23,839 --> 01:12:26,672
That portal's gotta be
here some place, son...

585
01:12:28,577 --> 01:12:31,410
Dad, wait...
I think it's over here...

586
01:12:47,329 --> 01:12:48,489
Wait here...

587
01:12:49,465 --> 01:12:51,262
I'm going with you!

588
01:12:51,900 --> 01:12:53,697
I've got to do this alone...

589
01:12:54,002 --> 01:12:55,594
I'm not lettin' you
go by yourself...

590
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:59,436
we're family...

591
01:13:06,348 --> 01:13:09,010
that's why ya gotta trust me, son!

592
01:14:27,429 --> 01:14:28,896
What's happening?

593
01:14:33,502 --> 01:14:35,231
Dad!

594
01:14:45,347 --> 01:14:46,575
Where do you think you're going?

595
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:06,700
You destroy my world,
now I'll destroy yours...

596
01:15:26,688 --> 01:15:27,814
Jack.

597
01:16:35,691 --> 01:16:38,683
Come on, Jack I thought
you had more than that!

598
01:17:15,197 --> 01:17:16,994
Wanna go another round?

599
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:24,635
This might be interesting
after all...

600
01:18:08,550 --> 01:18:10,177
Dad!

601
01:18:12,988 --> 01:18:15,718
Brad I told you to wait for me...

602
01:18:16,625 --> 01:18:19,253
You gotta trust me too dad...

603
01:18:19,961 --> 01:18:22,054
Consider yourself ungrounded.

604
01:18:25,233 --> 01:18:27,133
Let's go home, dad...

605
01:18:32,708 --> 01:18:34,699
The porthole is opening.

606
01:18:38,914 --> 01:18:40,506
Brad!

607
01:18:40,949 --> 01:18:44,146
-I'm so happy you made it.
-What about Jack?

608
01:18:44,553 --> 01:18:46,350
-Jack?
-Dad?

609
01:18:52,227 --> 01:18:53,922
You're not finished yet...

610
01:18:56,465 --> 01:18:58,626
Oh, my god.

611
01:18:59,367 --> 01:19:01,460
Jack is left behind...

612
01:19:13,815 --> 01:19:17,342
Your time is up Jack. Your life is mine.

613
01:19:42,244 --> 01:19:46,271
-Transport him back professor...
-I'm trying.

614
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:48,742
-I can't stop it...
-I'm going back in after him...

615
01:19:48,950 --> 01:19:51,418
No, Brad you can't. Pease, don't...

616
01:19:51,787 --> 01:19:53,345
Dad, don't give up.

617
01:19:54,689 --> 01:19:55,815
I need you

618
01:20:17,679 --> 01:20:20,614
I am the virus.
I needed a worthy opponent...

619
01:20:20,816 --> 01:20:23,842
so I used your love
for the boy to bring you here!

620
01:20:24,052 --> 01:20:26,987
I will destroy this world
and then yours...

621
01:20:41,736 --> 01:20:44,534
What's a matter, Jack.
You lose your nerve?

622
01:20:45,607 --> 01:20:47,768
Back up power supply
shutting down.

623
01:20:51,413 --> 01:20:54,348
-We're out of time
-Dad, I need you.

624
01:20:54,716 --> 01:20:56,479
I don't want to lose you too.

625
01:20:57,519 --> 01:21:00,079
I love you.

626
01:21:01,356 --> 01:21:03,085
Ilove you. Ilove you.

627
01:21:03,692 --> 01:21:05,660
Dad, Dad...

628
01:21:16,872 --> 01:21:18,533
I don't need this to finish you.

629
01:22:02,951 --> 01:22:04,441
Dad.

630
01:22:05,120 --> 01:22:06,610
Dad.

631
01:22:23,104 --> 01:22:26,005
I thought you were the virus...

632
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:28,107
I was wrong.

633
01:22:39,054 --> 01:22:41,989
Jack...
Oh I'm glad you're safe.

634
01:22:42,190 --> 01:22:44,055
How did you get here?

635
01:22:46,394 --> 01:22:48,794
I've learned to overcome
my programming.

636
01:22:49,164 --> 01:22:51,189
What's wrong?

637
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:58,033
You must use my energy
to open up the portal...

638
01:22:58,273 --> 01:23:00,434
to your world...

639
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:02,866
What do you mean?

640
01:23:17,058 --> 01:23:19,458
It's over. He's gone.

641
01:23:24,566 --> 01:23:26,227
Professor, professor.

642
01:23:28,303 --> 01:23:31,602
He's alive,
Brad take the visor off.

643
01:23:35,043 --> 01:23:36,340
Brad.

644
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:38,574
Dad!

645
01:23:42,083 --> 01:23:45,052
I'm so happy. Thank god.

646
01:23:46,821 --> 01:23:49,221
Jack, this is Sally.

647
01:23:52,894 --> 01:23:54,452
Hi.

648
01:24:06,007 --> 01:24:07,133
Block punch.

649
01:24:07,442 --> 01:24:09,137
Block punch.

650
01:24:09,411 --> 01:24:11,038
Block punch.

651
01:24:12,213 --> 01:24:14,113
Ooooh, excuse me guys...
Stop guys.

652
01:24:14,549 --> 01:24:16,608
Whose is this?
Whose is this?

653
01:24:18,053 --> 01:24:19,782
Excuse me.

654
01:24:31,699 --> 01:24:34,167
Break. Class, this way.

655
01:24:37,372 --> 01:24:40,705
Sometimes life's greatest
obstacles are just in our minds.

656
01:24:41,509 --> 01:24:43,272
If I put a two by four on
the ground here and...

657
01:24:43,478 --> 01:24:47,414
stretched it across the class, asked
you who wants to run across it...

658
01:24:47,615 --> 01:24:49,947
How many of you would do it?
How many of you would do it?

659
01:24:51,119 --> 01:24:52,677
Okay, very good. Very good.

660
01:24:53,388 --> 01:24:56,357
If I take the same two by
four and I put it on top of...

661
01:24:56,558 --> 01:24:59,152
two one hundred-story skyscrapers

662
01:24:59,360 --> 01:25:01,453
And now I say who wants
to run across it...

663
01:25:01,663 --> 01:25:05,190
how many of you would get on
there and run across that board?

664
01:25:06,968 --> 01:25:09,266
Not even you?
Well the reason is...

665
01:25:09,471 --> 01:25:11,405
when you concentrate
on the negative result...

666
01:25:11,606 --> 01:25:15,235
of making a mistake, you can't
put one foot in front of the other.

667
01:25:15,443 --> 01:25:17,604
It becomes almost impossible.
The easiest thing is walking.

668
01:25:18,913 --> 01:25:21,848
So that lesson that you
learn from this is this.

669
01:25:22,183 --> 01:25:26,381
Life's greatest obstacles many times
are just, just in our minds...

670
01:25:26,588 --> 01:25:29,113
and if you concentrate and put
one foot in front of the other...

671
01:25:29,324 --> 01:25:30,916
soon you can overcome
any obstacle.

672
01:25:31,259 --> 01:25:33,352
One foot in front of the other.

673
01:25:33,561 --> 01:25:37,691
Don't even think about falling,
but getting to the other side.

674
01:25:37,899 --> 01:25:39,662
Everybody understand?

675
01:25:39,868 --> 01:25:41,597
Okay, back to training.

676
01:25:45,273 --> 01:25:47,298
Back to the workout.

677
01:25:52,647 --> 01:25:54,342
Sifu...

678
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,179
Got room for one more?

679
01:26:53,775 --> 01:26:56,266
And your winner in junior
black belt forms...

680
01:26:56,477 --> 01:26:58,411
Brad Tanaka.

681
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:10,290
Does anybody
else want to play?
