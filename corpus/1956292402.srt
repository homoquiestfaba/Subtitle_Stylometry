1
00:00:14,800 --> 00:00:16,700
This is the story

2
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:20,200
of how a person
got from point A

3
00:00:20,300 --> 00:00:22,800
to point Z.

4
00:00:22,900 --> 00:00:26,400
Some call it fate,
others, chance.

5
00:00:26,500 --> 00:00:28,400
But whatever
you call it,

6
00:00:28,500 --> 00:00:32,300
it sure is an interesting
thing to ponder, don't
you think?

7
00:00:32,400 --> 00:00:35,700
The twisted paths
our lives follow.

8
00:00:35,700 --> 00:00:37,400
How did you get here?

9
00:00:37,500 --> 00:00:40,900
The place where you are
right now at this
very moment.

10
00:00:41,000 --> 00:00:44,200
What series of events
brought you to
this place?

11
00:00:44,200 --> 00:00:48,200
At this specific
point in time?

12
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:50,600
Where are you in life?

13
00:00:50,700 --> 00:00:53,900
Are things turning out
the way you'd planned?

14
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:56,200
And by the way,
when was the last time

15
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,300
you spoke with
your parents?

16
00:00:58,400 --> 00:01:00,700
Don't you think
you ought to give
them a call?

17
00:01:00,700 --> 00:01:04,700
To thank them
for the set
of circumstances

18
00:01:04,800 --> 00:01:07,000
that brought
them together,

19
00:01:07,100 --> 00:01:08,800
at a certain place,

20
00:01:08,900 --> 00:01:12,000
at a certain
moment in time,

21
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,100
when you
were created.

22
00:01:16,200 --> 00:01:18,100
Uhh,

23
00:01:18,200 --> 00:01:20,700
what were we
talking about?

24
00:01:20,800 --> 00:01:23,800
How you
got here.

25
00:01:23,800 --> 00:01:27,400
Yeah.

26
00:01:27,500 --> 00:01:29,600
Jesus Christ,
I can't believe

27
00:01:29,700 --> 00:01:32,300
I'm still so...

28
00:01:32,400 --> 00:01:33,400
uh,

29
00:01:33,500 --> 00:01:35,200
Stoned?

30
00:01:35,300 --> 00:01:37,300
Yeah!

31
00:01:37,300 --> 00:01:42,100
A glass of orange juice
sure would hit the spot
about now, wouldn't it?

32
00:01:42,200 --> 00:01:45,100
And some Tostitos.

33
00:01:45,200 --> 00:01:48,000
That's it!
Oh, man!

34
00:01:48,100 --> 00:01:49,900
That's exactly
what I'm thinking!

35
00:01:49,900 --> 00:01:51,800
OJ and Tostitos!
Jesus!

36
00:01:51,900 --> 00:01:54,500
It's like you're
reading my thoughts
or something!

37
00:01:54,600 --> 00:01:56,900
I am.

38
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:59,700
Whoa.

39
00:01:59,800 --> 00:02:01,300
So go on.

40
00:02:01,400 --> 00:02:03,500
What am
I thinking
about now?

41
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:06,700
Well, there are many
thoughts racing through
your head.

42
00:02:06,700 --> 00:02:10,500
The first concerns
the orange juice
and Tostitos.

43
00:02:10,600 --> 00:02:12,700
Yeah.

44
00:02:12,800 --> 00:02:14,200
And the second,

45
00:02:14,200 --> 00:02:17,300
the second thought,
oh, how it vexes you.

46
00:02:17,400 --> 00:02:20,000
U h-huh.
What is it?

47
00:02:20,100 --> 00:02:21,800
It is this.

48
00:02:21,900 --> 00:02:26,900
Why are you having
a conversation with
Roscoe Lee Browne?

49
00:02:27,000 --> 00:02:30,900
Ha!
Roscoe Lee?

50
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:34,100
Holy shit!
You're famous!

51
00:02:34,200 --> 00:02:35,900
Yes, I am.

52
00:02:35,900 --> 00:02:41,100
I can't fucking
believe I'm having
a conversation

53
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:43,600
with Roscoe
Lee Browne!

54
00:02:43,600 --> 00:02:46,500
Okay. Ready
for number three?

55
00:02:46,600 --> 00:02:49,200
You bet I
am, Roscoe.

56
00:02:49,300 --> 00:02:52,100
Your third thought
is simply this. ;

57
00:02:53,400 --> 00:02:54,800
How in the hell

58
00:02:54,800 --> 00:02:57,100
did I end up
on a ferris wheel?

59
00:02:58,900 --> 00:03:00,400
How did
you know that?

60
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:02,900
Because, you
fucking pothead,

61
00:03:02,900 --> 00:03:04,900
you're talking
to yourself.

62
00:03:10,000 --> 00:03:14,000
Shit. How the hell
did I get here?

63
00:03:42,700 --> 00:03:45,100
I guess maybe it was

64
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,300
a little early
in the morning to
be getting stoned.

65
00:03:51,000 --> 00:03:52,400
But whatever,
you know.

66
00:03:52,500 --> 00:03:54,100
It's not like
I just sit around

67
00:03:54,100 --> 00:03:57,200
collecting checks
from my parents
or something.

68
00:03:57,300 --> 00:03:59,800
I did that regional
soda ad a while back,

69
00:03:59,900 --> 00:04:02,800
Doctor Bjorn's Famous
Old-Fashioned Root Beer.

70
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:05,700
Maybe you saw
it? Anyhow,
between that

71
00:04:05,800 --> 00:04:08,500
and unemployment I
get by. Bla-bla-bla.

72
00:04:08,500 --> 00:04:10,400
All I know
is this game is

73
00:04:10,500 --> 00:04:14,400
so fucking cool
when you're high.

74
00:04:14,500 --> 00:04:17,200
They say a true pothead
stops getting the munchies

75
00:04:17,300 --> 00:04:20,300
after a certain point.
I mean, a true pothead

76
00:04:20,400 --> 00:04:23,200
wouldn't even say
the word "munchies."
I don't know

77
00:04:23,200 --> 00:04:25,200
what the true
pothead would say,

78
00:04:25,300 --> 00:04:29,200
"Munchos" or "hungries"
or something.

79
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:34,100
At any rate, I still
love to eat when
I'm high.

80
00:04:34,200 --> 00:04:36,100
So fuck you
if you're too cool

81
00:04:36,200 --> 00:04:38,400
to get hungry
when you're stoned.

82
00:04:43,000 --> 00:04:47,600
My free one year supply
of Doctor Bjorn's.
Neat, huh?

83
00:05:01,800 --> 00:05:05,300
I n the six months
I've lived with my
roommate, Steve,

84
00:05:05,400 --> 00:05:08,000
I've never seen
him get high.

85
00:05:08,900 --> 00:05:10,500
Not once.

86
00:05:10,600 --> 00:05:15,800
He even kind
of looks down
on me for doing it.

87
00:05:15,800 --> 00:05:18,400
God, you are
so pathetic.

88
00:05:18,400 --> 00:05:20,300
H uh?

89
00:05:20,400 --> 00:05:23,000
Here's the deal
with Steve.

90
00:05:23,100 --> 00:05:26,000
He scares me.

91
00:05:26,000 --> 00:05:29,000
Oh, hi, Steve.

92
00:05:33,900 --> 00:05:35,500
See what I mean?

93
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:37,500
Steve's one of those
"Dress in costume

94
00:05:37,600 --> 00:05:39,500
and wait in line
for Star Wars" types,

95
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:40,400
but angry.

96
00:05:40,500 --> 00:05:42,800
Real anti-social.

97
00:05:42,900 --> 00:05:45,600
I've always tried
to stay on Steve's
good side,

98
00:05:45,700 --> 00:05:49,000
who knows what can
happen with a
weirdo like that?

99
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:57,200
Mm!
Mm!

100
00:06:11,300 --> 00:06:13,700
I know he made
that sign telling
me not to,

101
00:06:13,800 --> 00:06:18,100
but I had a counter plan.
A really good counter plan.

102
00:06:18,200 --> 00:06:20,900
I would bake
Steve some
more cupcakes.

103
00:06:20,900 --> 00:06:22,900
Some even
better cupcakes.

104
00:06:34,000 --> 00:06:36,300
And then,

105
00:06:36,300 --> 00:06:39,200
I recognized
the true nature

106
00:06:39,300 --> 00:06:43,200
of the cupcakes
I had consumed.

107
00:07:00,900 --> 00:07:02,800
Oh, shit.

108
00:08:30,700 --> 00:08:33,100
Oh, fuck.

109
00:08:33,200 --> 00:08:36,300
Listen, Jane.
I really busted
my ass

110
00:08:36,400 --> 00:08:39,100
getting you this
audition so please,
please, please

111
00:08:39,100 --> 00:08:42,100
don't fuck it up.
It seems like you
don't even give

112
00:08:42,100 --> 00:08:44,000
a shit about
any of this.

113
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,300
Do you?
Do you even
give a shit?

114
00:08:47,400 --> 00:08:49,600
I give a shit.

115
00:08:51,700 --> 00:08:55,600
Plan... need a plan.

116
00:09:08,100 --> 00:09:09,500
My plan.

117
00:09:09,600 --> 00:09:13,400
N umber one.
Buy more pot.

118
00:09:13,500 --> 00:09:16,500
You know,
so I can make more
cupcakes for Steve.

119
00:09:16,600 --> 00:09:19,400
N umber two. ; use
the money Steve left

120
00:09:19,500 --> 00:09:21,800
for the power bill to
purchase said pot.

121
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:23,900
That way I
can bake some
fresh cupcakes

122
00:09:23,900 --> 00:09:25,300
before he gets back.

123
00:09:25,300 --> 00:09:27,400
Then I'll go
to my audition.

124
00:09:27,400 --> 00:09:30,700
I mean, number three. ;
go to my audition.

125
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:33,800
I've never been
to an audition
this stoned before.

126
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,700
But I'd be willing to wager
that I'd be damned good

127
00:09:36,800 --> 00:09:39,400
because I'll be even
more in touch with
my creative self

128
00:09:39,500 --> 00:09:42,300
That's not really
a part of the plan.
Scratch that.

129
00:09:45,900 --> 00:09:49,700
Four. ; hit the cash machine,
zip on over to pay
that power bill,

130
00:09:49,800 --> 00:09:51,700
pick up cupcake
supplies at the store

131
00:09:51,800 --> 00:09:53,900
and head on back
to home base to
bake 'em up.

132
00:09:57,800 --> 00:10:03,900
Not bad... for a person
who happens to
be quite stoned.

133
00:10:09,100 --> 00:10:11,000
You're baked.

134
00:10:11,000 --> 00:10:12,000
No.

135
00:10:12,100 --> 00:10:14,000
What makes
you think that?

136
00:10:18,800 --> 00:10:22,700
Just, you
know, the usual.

137
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:26,100
Actually, you
better make it
a full ounce.

138
00:10:26,200 --> 00:10:28,700
I 'm gonna
be making
some cupcakes.

139
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:31,100
You got it.

140
00:10:43,500 --> 00:10:45,200
What's going on
over there?

141
00:10:45,300 --> 00:10:47,500
Who's there?
Is someone
in my apartment?

142
00:10:47,600 --> 00:10:50,700
Man, you really
are stoned.

143
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:54,300
N umber one. ;
Buy more pot.

144
00:11:00,000 --> 00:11:01,500
You're like
40 short.

145
00:11:03,600 --> 00:11:06,100
Can I just...

146
00:11:06,100 --> 00:11:07,300
you know...

147
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:12,300
Goddamn it, Jane,
this is the last time.

148
00:11:12,400 --> 00:11:14,200
You have to pay
me back today.

149
00:11:14,300 --> 00:11:16,000
No problem-o.

150
00:11:16,100 --> 00:11:18,600
I 'm marking
it down...
in the book.

151
00:11:20,200 --> 00:11:23,500
I just gotta hit
the cash machine,
my man.

152
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:35,900
It's all
about capitalism

153
00:11:35,900 --> 00:11:38,000
and shit like
that, you know?

154
00:11:38,100 --> 00:11:40,800
Who creates the jobs?
Where do they
come from?

155
00:11:40,900 --> 00:11:42,600
The profits
I make,
for example,

156
00:11:42,700 --> 00:11:46,500
trickle down through
the economy in ways
I can't even comprehend.

157
00:11:46,700 --> 00:11:49,800
It makes sense.
I 'm totally vibing
you, dude.

158
00:11:49,900 --> 00:11:52,500
Yeah, simple Reaganomics
apply to the production
of hemp.

159
00:11:52,600 --> 00:11:58,300
Well, I don't think
that really qualifies
as Reaganomics, but...

160
00:11:58,400 --> 00:12:00,000
What are you
talking about?

161
00:12:00,100 --> 00:12:02,600
Just because
weed isn't taxed

162
00:12:02,700 --> 00:12:05,900
doesn't mean
it exists in
some sort of,

163
00:12:05,900 --> 00:12:09,900
you know, laissez
faire paradigm
or whatever.

164
00:12:09,900 --> 00:12:11,900
Did you just
use "paradigm"
in a sentence?

165
00:12:12,000 --> 00:12:13,200
Yeah, man.

166
00:12:13,300 --> 00:12:15,200
I mean,
what you do
is great and all,

167
00:12:15,300 --> 00:12:17,700
God bless you
for it, but it sounds

168
00:12:17,800 --> 00:12:20,500
like plain old market
capitalism to me.

169
00:12:20,600 --> 00:12:22,200
It's Reaganomics.
Trust me.

170
00:12:22,300 --> 00:12:27,200
What about it
is Reaganomics? The
black market isn't taxed.

171
00:12:27,300 --> 00:12:29,500
Listen, Jane,
you're fucking stoned

172
00:12:29,500 --> 00:12:32,100
and I happen to be
very knowledgeable
about this.

173
00:12:32,200 --> 00:12:36,600
Whoopee! You
own a U V lamp. Let's
start the revolution!

174
00:12:36,600 --> 00:12:38,900
What the fuck do
you know about
economics anyway?

175
00:12:39,000 --> 00:12:44,100
Well... I majored
in economics
in college

176
00:12:44,200 --> 00:12:47,200
and graduated
fucking Summa.

177
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:49,600
I think I know
a thing or two
about it.

178
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:52,700
I thought you
were an actress.

179
00:12:54,100 --> 00:12:57,500
Economics didn't
really work out.

180
00:13:01,200 --> 00:13:02,800
This is
where I 'll be.

181
00:13:02,900 --> 00:13:05,200
Meet me there with
the money at
three o'clock.

182
00:13:05,300 --> 00:13:08,400
Yeah.
Okay.

183
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:14,500
What is this?

184
00:13:14,600 --> 00:13:18,300
I 'vet never even
heard of half of
these movies.

185
00:13:19,700 --> 00:13:21,400
Oh.

186
00:13:21,500 --> 00:13:25,600
Actually, my
roommate's hosting this

187
00:13:25,700 --> 00:13:30,100
science fiction
nerd convention
this weekend

188
00:13:30,200 --> 00:13:33,200
with his buddies
flying in from
Toledo and...

189
00:13:33,300 --> 00:13:34,400
Hey!

190
00:13:34,500 --> 00:13:37,300
Three o'clock!
Meet me in Venice

191
00:13:37,400 --> 00:13:39,800
with the money
at three.

192
00:13:39,800 --> 00:13:41,900
Do not make me send
my associates
over here

193
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:43,900
to collect
the hard way.

194
00:13:43,900 --> 00:13:45,300
You mean,
like kill me?

195
00:13:45,400 --> 00:13:46,800
No, Jesus.
Of course not.

196
00:13:46,900 --> 00:13:49,800
So you'll probably
just break my
arms, then?

197
00:13:49,900 --> 00:13:51,600
Break your arms?
Janey, what
the fuck?

198
00:13:51,700 --> 00:13:52,800
I 'm a dude
who sells weed,

199
00:13:52,800 --> 00:13:54,300
I 'm not Tony
fucking Soprano.

200
00:13:54,400 --> 00:13:56,700
Well, what then?

201
00:13:56,800 --> 00:13:58,200
I don't know.

202
00:13:58,300 --> 00:14:00,000
Take your furniture,
or something.

203
00:14:04,900 --> 00:14:06,000
H mm.

204
00:14:07,700 --> 00:14:09,400
So, Jane,

205
00:14:12,100 --> 00:14:13,600
what's the deal
with your roommate?

206
00:14:13,700 --> 00:14:15,300
Steve?

207
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,100
What about him?

208
00:14:18,200 --> 00:14:19,600
He gives me
the creeps.

209
00:14:21,200 --> 00:14:23,300
I think he might
be one of those
skull fuckers.

210
00:14:23,400 --> 00:14:24,400
Know what
I 'm saying?

211
00:14:24,500 --> 00:14:30,200
I bet that dude
fucks skulls,

212
00:14:30,300 --> 00:14:31,800
with candles
and shit.

213
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:44,300
Oh my God!
You're right!

214
00:14:44,400 --> 00:14:45,800
He's a fucking freak.

215
00:14:45,900 --> 00:14:47,300
So, listen.

216
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,000
It would be a shame
if you didn't pay
me back today,

217
00:14:50,100 --> 00:14:51,900
and in addition
to taking
your furniture,

218
00:14:52,000 --> 00:14:53,300
I had to tell
your roommate

219
00:14:53,400 --> 00:14:56,200
how you spent
the cash for
the power bill.

220
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:39,100
Hello?

221
00:15:39,200 --> 00:15:41,200
Jane?

222
00:15:41,200 --> 00:15:43,400
Hey!

223
00:15:43,500 --> 00:15:45,700
Is this...?

224
00:15:45,800 --> 00:15:47,400
Who is this?

225
00:15:47,500 --> 00:15:49,100
It's Kyle.

226
00:15:49,200 --> 00:15:51,500
Oh, hey, baby,
what's up?

227
00:15:51,600 --> 00:15:53,200
You asked me
to call you

228
00:15:53,300 --> 00:15:56,100
to remind
you to go
to that audition?

229
00:15:57,700 --> 00:15:59,000
Are you stoned?

230
00:15:59,000 --> 00:16:00,600
Stoned?

231
00:16:00,600 --> 00:16:04,400
It's fucking 10.;45
in the morning.

232
00:16:04,400 --> 00:16:07,700
Know what, Jane?
This isn't really
working out.

233
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:11,700
L-I don't understand.
You're speaking
in riddles.

234
00:16:13,400 --> 00:16:18,800
Kyle, you need to
listen very carefully

235
00:16:18,800 --> 00:16:24,200
to what I 'm saying
and stop trying to
confuse the issue.

236
00:16:25,700 --> 00:16:30,200
What? Wait, Kyle!
I can't hear you!

237
00:16:30,300 --> 00:16:35,300
Kyle! Hold on!
I just have to...
Shut up!

238
00:16:38,300 --> 00:16:40,300
Oh, shit.

239
00:16:48,700 --> 00:16:52,000
Kyle? You still there?

240
00:16:56,500 --> 00:16:59,200
Now what am
I gonna do?

241
00:17:02,900 --> 00:17:04,700
I can't.

242
00:17:11,400 --> 00:17:13,000
I daren't.

243
00:17:14,200 --> 00:17:16,400
I really shouldn't.

244
00:17:26,800 --> 00:17:29,300
The government weed.

245
00:17:31,500 --> 00:17:35,300
I was saving the
government weed for
a special occasion,

246
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:40,400
but the government weed
will fetch a fair price
on the open market.

247
00:17:40,500 --> 00:17:42,800
A very fair price.

248
00:17:44,500 --> 00:17:47,500
Maybe just enough
to bail me out of
this jam.

249
00:17:47,500 --> 00:17:50,000
N umber three. ;
Go to my audition.

250
00:18:46,300 --> 00:18:47,600
Whoa.

251
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:49,800
That was intense.

252
00:19:18,200 --> 00:19:20,300
Getting on?

253
00:19:20,300 --> 00:19:22,300
I've never ridden
a bus in
L.A. Before.

254
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,500
This is
gonna be fun.

255
00:19:23,500 --> 00:19:28,100
Yeah, you're in
for a real treat.

256
00:19:44,400 --> 00:19:46,000
Hey I You squashed
Bobby's car.

257
00:19:48,800 --> 00:19:50,500
He spent
weeks putting
that together.

258
00:19:52,700 --> 00:19:54,500
Hey, right on.
Look what
you've done.

259
00:19:54,500 --> 00:19:56,000
I saw her.
She just

260
00:19:56,100 --> 00:19:59,300
fell right over.
She didn't even
try to stay up.

261
00:19:59,400 --> 00:20:01,300
Hey! One
thirty-five!

262
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:02,500
Okay.
Hold on.

263
00:20:02,500 --> 00:20:03,200
Get up.

264
00:20:03,300 --> 00:20:04,500
I'm trying.

265
00:20:04,500 --> 00:20:06,100
There's something
wrong with her.

266
00:20:06,200 --> 00:20:09,000
There's nothing
wrong with
me, lady.

267
00:20:09,100 --> 00:20:11,000
What was it
doing on the
floor anyway?

268
00:20:11,100 --> 00:20:12,900
It wasn't
on the floor,
fucking pothead.

269
00:20:13,000 --> 00:20:14,400
You knocked
it out of
his hands.

270
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:15,600
I saw it.

271
00:20:15,700 --> 00:20:17,000
I'm sorry.

272
00:20:17,100 --> 00:20:19,100
That's not gonna
bring his
car back.

273
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:20,400
I think she's
on drugs.

274
00:20:20,400 --> 00:20:22,200
He built
that for
his grandfather,

275
00:20:22,300 --> 00:20:23,800
in the hospital.

276
00:20:23,800 --> 00:20:25,500
Hey, lady!
One thirty five!

277
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,000
I'm getting it!

278
00:20:33,700 --> 00:20:35,000
Hey!

279
00:20:35,100 --> 00:20:36,100
Hey!

280
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,200
That was a close one.

281
00:20:49,600 --> 00:20:50,900
"Come on, Frank.

282
00:20:50,900 --> 00:20:53,100
"You know
I love surprises.

283
00:20:53,200 --> 00:20:57,300
That's a fact.
I'm always willing
to make exceptions."

284
00:20:57,400 --> 00:21:01,100
What a piece of shit.

285
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:02,800
"Come on, Frank.

286
00:21:02,800 --> 00:21:04,400
"You know
I love surprises.

287
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:09,500
That's a fact.
I 'm always willing
to make exceptions?"

288
00:21:09,500 --> 00:21:11,900
"I 'm always willing
to make exceptions!"

289
00:21:13,500 --> 00:21:16,400
"I 'm always willing
to make exceptions!

290
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:20,900
"I'm always willing
to make exceptions!!"

291
00:21:35,300 --> 00:21:37,100
Four. Hit the
cash machine.

292
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:51,400
Wha...? I had over
a thousand dollars
in this account!

293
00:21:54,700 --> 00:21:56,800
Oh, yeah.

294
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,100
Oh, no!

295
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:12,200
Take your furniture
or something like that.

296
00:22:12,300 --> 00:22:17,500
No! Not my bed!
Not my Sleep
N umber bed!

297
00:22:27,200 --> 00:22:28,500
Hey I

298
00:22:34,400 --> 00:22:36,400
You forgot
to sign in.

299
00:22:49,700 --> 00:22:54,000
"Come on, Frank.
You know I
love surprises."

300
00:23:08,700 --> 00:23:09,900
Have a seat.

301
00:23:26,900 --> 00:23:27,800
Hi.

302
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Do you have
any gum?

303
00:23:30,900 --> 00:23:33,600
Uhm,

304
00:23:33,700 --> 00:23:35,400
I, uh,

305
00:23:35,400 --> 00:23:37,500
wait.

306
00:23:42,100 --> 00:23:45,800
Holy shit!
Where'd this
come from?

307
00:23:47,100 --> 00:23:48,100
Do you
want some?

308
00:23:48,200 --> 00:23:49,800
No, thank you!
No, no, no.

309
00:23:49,900 --> 00:23:53,300
Seriously. I
could really use
the cash.

310
00:23:53,400 --> 00:23:54,800
No, I don't.

311
00:23:54,800 --> 00:23:56,100
200 bucks.

312
00:23:56,200 --> 00:23:59,300
No, I don't want any.
No. I don't want it.

313
00:24:09,000 --> 00:24:12,100
I 'm really
stoned. Sorry.

314
00:24:23,300 --> 00:24:27,800
Jane! Jane!

315
00:24:27,900 --> 00:24:29,000
Yeah!
Yes, here!

316
00:24:29,100 --> 00:24:30,400
Are you ready?

317
00:24:30,500 --> 00:24:32,100
You betcha!

318
00:24:36,300 --> 00:24:37,500
Hello.

319
00:24:37,600 --> 00:24:39,700
Hi! I 'm Jane.
It's nice to
meet you.

320
00:24:42,000 --> 00:24:46,100
I, um, heard
a lot about you.

321
00:24:46,200 --> 00:24:47,800
Excuse me?

322
00:24:47,800 --> 00:24:51,300
Nothing.

323
00:24:54,300 --> 00:24:56,600
Whee!

324
00:24:56,700 --> 00:24:57,800
Are you alright?

325
00:24:57,800 --> 00:25:00,200
I'm fantastic!
How are you?

326
00:25:00,300 --> 00:25:02,100
I'm fine.

327
00:25:02,100 --> 00:25:03,500
Great!

328
00:25:06,300 --> 00:25:07,600
Hang on a second.

329
00:25:07,700 --> 00:25:08,500
What?

330
00:25:08,600 --> 00:25:09,800
H uh?

331
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,500
Did you just
say something?

332
00:25:11,600 --> 00:25:12,500
Who, me?

333
00:25:12,600 --> 00:25:13,900
Yes.

334
00:25:13,900 --> 00:25:16,600
I'm sorry.
I didn't realize
I had spoken.

335
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,400
Are you ready?

336
00:25:28,400 --> 00:25:31,100
I sure am.

337
00:25:32,200 --> 00:25:33,400
Are you ready?

338
00:25:33,400 --> 00:25:35,600
I sure am.

339
00:25:35,700 --> 00:25:38,200
Okay.

340
00:25:47,600 --> 00:25:49,000
"Come on, Frank!

341
00:25:49,100 --> 00:25:51,100
You know
I love surprises!"

342
00:25:51,200 --> 00:25:52,500
I'm gonna stop
you right there.

343
00:25:52,600 --> 00:25:54,400
I want you
to do it again,
but this time,

344
00:25:54,500 --> 00:25:57,000
pull it
way back.

345
00:25:57,100 --> 00:25:58,900
Okay. Sure.
Sure. You got it.

346
00:26:02,900 --> 00:26:06,100
"Come on, Frank. You
know I love surprises."

347
00:26:06,200 --> 00:26:07,100
What are
you doing?

348
00:26:07,100 --> 00:26:08,600
I'm pulling it back.

349
00:26:08,600 --> 00:26:12,600
Not that much.
Can't you find
some middle ground?

350
00:26:12,700 --> 00:26:15,600
You better believe
I can find a
middle ground!

351
00:26:15,700 --> 00:26:17,700
Middle ground
is my middle name!

352
00:26:22,800 --> 00:26:24,300
Thank you.

353
00:26:24,300 --> 00:26:25,600
So how'd I do?

354
00:26:25,700 --> 00:26:28,300
You did some
very interesting work.

355
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:32,500
Really?
Yes!

356
00:26:32,600 --> 00:26:38,400
Well, thanks.
You have a
wonderful day.

357
00:26:41,000 --> 00:26:44,000
Hey, let me
ask you something.

358
00:26:45,500 --> 00:26:48,100
Do you want to
buy some pot?

359
00:26:50,500 --> 00:26:53,700
Are you trying
to sell me drugs?

360
00:26:53,800 --> 00:26:54,900
Well...

361
00:26:55,000 --> 00:26:57,600
Young lady, have
a seat outside!

362
00:26:57,700 --> 00:26:59,200
Gee, you don't
have to yell.

363
00:26:59,300 --> 00:27:00,300
Sit!

364
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:01,300
Here?

365
00:27:01,400 --> 00:27:02,800
I n the
waiting area!!

366
00:27:02,900 --> 00:27:05,200
Bob I Get
in here!

367
00:27:07,600 --> 00:27:10,100
Tried to sell
me marijuana.

368
00:27:10,100 --> 00:27:13,600
Hey! Guys, I
was just kidding.

369
00:27:30,600 --> 00:27:32,800
She tried to
sell you what?!

370
00:27:40,300 --> 00:27:42,800
Do you remember
Anyone here

371
00:27:45,600 --> 00:27:48,600
No, you don't remember
Anything at all

372
00:27:56,200 --> 00:27:58,600
Never woke up

373
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:05,400
There's a party
I n my mind

374
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:10,200
I'm hoping
Never stops

375
00:28:10,300 --> 00:28:14,800
There's a party
U p there

376
00:28:22,100 --> 00:28:23,800
I'm taking
a shit!

377
00:28:25,000 --> 00:28:26,900
Hold on!
I'm shitting!

378
00:28:27,000 --> 00:28:28,700
I 'm just
taking a shit!

379
00:28:30,200 --> 00:28:33,400
Still shitting!
Nothing to worry about.

380
00:28:33,500 --> 00:28:35,800
I 'm just taking
a big old dump.

381
00:28:41,600 --> 00:28:46,500
That's it.
All done.
I'm finished.

382
00:28:46,600 --> 00:28:49,900
You got
nothing on me!
Nada! Zilcho!

383
00:28:50,000 --> 00:28:52,200
Go ahead and frisk me!
Give it your best shot!

384
00:29:17,000 --> 00:29:19,000
Hello there, Smiley.

385
00:29:19,100 --> 00:29:21,800
Hi, Jane.

386
00:29:33,500 --> 00:29:36,400
Meet me in
Venice at three.

387
00:29:37,900 --> 00:29:40,400
You better
get going.

388
00:29:40,400 --> 00:29:45,800
I 'm way ahead of
you, Smiley. Way
ahead of you.

389
00:29:52,400 --> 00:29:53,100
Shelly!

390
00:29:56,900 --> 00:29:58,300
This is Shelly.

391
00:29:58,300 --> 00:29:59,700
Please leave
a message.

392
00:29:59,700 --> 00:30:02,100
Hey, Shelly I
Guess who!

393
00:30:02,100 --> 00:30:04,200
So, listen. I'm
looking for a ride

394
00:30:04,300 --> 00:30:07,700
out to Venice
for this Hemp
Festival thing.

395
00:30:07,800 --> 00:30:10,200
And it sounds
cool, right?

396
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:12,100
Anyway, I thought
you might dig it.

397
00:30:12,200 --> 00:30:15,000
But I guess
you're not there.

398
00:30:15,100 --> 00:30:17,100
U m,

399
00:30:17,200 --> 00:30:22,000
Jesus, Shelly, I'm
so fucking stoned
you wouldn't believe it!

400
00:30:22,100 --> 00:30:23,100
Call me.

401
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:27,900
Hi, please leave
a message

402
00:30:27,900 --> 00:30:30,300
for me or Tony
after the beep.

403
00:30:32,700 --> 00:30:34,500
U h,

404
00:30:34,600 --> 00:30:36,200
who is
this again?

405
00:30:44,600 --> 00:30:45,900
Hello?

406
00:30:46,000 --> 00:30:47,300
Mrs. Green?

407
00:30:47,400 --> 00:30:48,400
Yes.

408
00:30:48,500 --> 00:30:50,300
It's Jane!

409
00:30:50,400 --> 00:30:51,800
Who?

410
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:55,800
Jane! I studied
clarinet with you!

411
00:30:55,900 --> 00:31:02,000
It doesn't
really ring a...
H mm, I, I don't...

412
00:31:04,400 --> 00:31:06,900
Brevin Ericson.

413
00:31:15,600 --> 00:31:18,800
Oh, boy.

414
00:31:18,900 --> 00:31:23,100
Shall we say a few words
about Brevin Ericson?

415
00:31:23,200 --> 00:31:26,000
Shall we say
a few words
about love?

416
00:31:28,400 --> 00:31:31,100
For Brevin Ericson
is completely,

417
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:35,600
100% head
over heels
in love.

418
00:31:37,400 --> 00:31:39,800
Perhaps it's difficult
for you to comprehend

419
00:31:39,900 --> 00:31:43,300
how anybody could be
so passionately
inclined toward

420
00:31:43,400 --> 00:31:46,200
someone like this.

421
00:31:46,300 --> 00:31:48,700
But do not judge
her too harshly.

422
00:31:48,800 --> 00:31:53,000
After all, how was
she to know they
were pot cupcakes?

423
00:31:53,000 --> 00:31:56,400
And ask yourselves,
who amongst you

424
00:31:56,500 --> 00:31:58,200
might not have
done the same?

425
00:31:58,200 --> 00:32:03,800
Who are we to judge
heartbeats in a
young man's heart?

426
00:32:10,600 --> 00:32:14,200
Do you want Lightning
Strikes Thrice?

427
00:32:14,300 --> 00:32:15,500
Yeah.

428
00:32:15,600 --> 00:32:17,100
Do you want
Secret Secret Agents?

429
00:32:17,200 --> 00:32:18,100
I already have...

430
00:32:18,100 --> 00:32:23,000
Exactly.

431
00:32:23,100 --> 00:32:28,100
Dude, your roommate
is kind of hot.

432
00:32:30,600 --> 00:32:33,200
You're kidding,
right?

433
00:33:56,400 --> 00:34:00,400
You're so good.

434
00:34:00,500 --> 00:34:04,000
No!

435
00:34:04,000 --> 00:34:06,300
Oh, Brevin I

436
00:34:06,400 --> 00:34:08,100
You're beating me.

437
00:34:08,100 --> 00:34:09,600
Damn it I

438
00:34:13,400 --> 00:34:18,300
Oh, Brevin,
right in there.

439
00:34:18,300 --> 00:34:20,500
Oh I

440
00:34:20,600 --> 00:34:24,000
Oh, yeah.

441
00:34:24,000 --> 00:34:28,100
But...

442
00:34:28,100 --> 00:34:30,600
I thought you
had a boyfriend.

443
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:33,800
We're kinda
taking a break
right now.

444
00:34:33,900 --> 00:34:35,300
M m-hmm.

445
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:37,300
What's that got
to do with anything?

446
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:43,300
I 'm talking about
something bigger
than our petty yearnings.

447
00:34:43,400 --> 00:34:45,500
Of course.

448
00:34:48,000 --> 00:34:50,000
So are we doing
this or what?

449
00:34:50,100 --> 00:34:51,600
Well...

450
00:34:51,600 --> 00:34:55,000
Come on, man.
It's going to be
fucking transformative.

451
00:34:55,100 --> 00:34:57,400
It sounds great.
I just...

452
00:34:57,500 --> 00:34:59,000
What?

453
00:35:00,200 --> 00:35:02,800
I, uh...

454
00:35:07,100 --> 00:35:11,000
So, you are sure
you want to come to
the dentist with me?

455
00:35:11,100 --> 00:35:14,100
Absolutely, man.
Absolutely.

456
00:35:14,200 --> 00:35:17,100
Let me just drop
you off at a coffee
shop or something.

457
00:35:17,200 --> 00:35:19,800
No, not necessary,
my good man.

458
00:35:19,900 --> 00:35:21,500
I 'm really looking
forward to it.

459
00:35:21,600 --> 00:35:23,700
So last week
they worked on
my left side.

460
00:35:23,800 --> 00:35:26,000
Today they're gonna
finish on my right.

461
00:35:26,000 --> 00:35:30,200
And I tell you, Jane,
they really get in there
deep with the scraping.

462
00:35:30,200 --> 00:35:33,600
A deep scraping?

463
00:35:33,700 --> 00:35:35,200
Yeah.

464
00:35:35,300 --> 00:35:38,400
That sounds
fucking awesome.

465
00:35:38,400 --> 00:35:40,300
Maybe I
should get one.

466
00:35:40,400 --> 00:35:43,300
I think you need
an appointment.

467
00:35:43,400 --> 00:35:45,900
Oh, yeah.

468
00:35:46,000 --> 00:35:48,100
An appointment.

469
00:36:10,300 --> 00:36:14,000
Yep, that's pretty
funny I guess.

470
00:36:14,100 --> 00:36:17,100
I don't even know
what I 'm laughing at.

471
00:36:19,400 --> 00:36:23,300
So, how much
do you think
you'd need?

472
00:36:25,700 --> 00:36:29,000
I don't know.
Like five...

473
00:36:29,000 --> 00:36:30,300
Dollars?

474
00:36:30,400 --> 00:36:32,200
Yeah, I need
to borrow $5.

475
00:36:32,300 --> 00:36:34,600
Well, what then?
Like $500?

476
00:36:34,700 --> 00:36:37,200
Yeah, that
should do it.

477
00:36:38,500 --> 00:36:39,600
Really?

478
00:36:39,700 --> 00:36:41,900
Hey, if you can't,
it's no biggie.

479
00:36:41,900 --> 00:36:44,700
No, I can
swing that.

480
00:36:44,800 --> 00:36:46,600
Really?

481
00:36:46,700 --> 00:36:48,300
You're gonna pay
me back, right?

482
00:36:48,400 --> 00:36:52,000
Absolutely.
Of course.

483
00:36:52,100 --> 00:36:57,000
My wallet's
in the glove box.
Get it for me?

484
00:36:58,800 --> 00:37:01,300
I may have
five C notes
right here.

485
00:37:01,400 --> 00:37:03,500
That would be
so fucking great.

486
00:37:08,500 --> 00:37:10,800
Nope. I don't
have it.

487
00:37:10,800 --> 00:37:12,700
We're gonna
have to stop
at a machine.

488
00:37:12,800 --> 00:37:16,500
Why do you need
500 dollars again?

489
00:37:18,100 --> 00:37:19,100
Well...

490
00:37:32,800 --> 00:37:37,100
I don't think Steve
would fuck a skull.

491
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:39,800
Why do you
keep it in
the glove box?

492
00:37:39,800 --> 00:37:41,100
What?

493
00:37:41,100 --> 00:37:42,900
Your wallet.

494
00:37:43,000 --> 00:37:47,100
It's too thick.
It hurts my butt
when I 'm driving.

495
00:37:47,200 --> 00:37:50,200
That makes
total sense.

496
00:37:55,300 --> 00:37:56,200
Hey!

497
00:37:56,300 --> 00:37:57,400
What?

498
00:37:57,500 --> 00:38:00,900
Oh I I've been
to that housel

499
00:38:01,000 --> 00:38:01,900
Which house?

500
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:03,300
That one back there!

501
00:38:03,400 --> 00:38:05,400
An old college
professor of mine
lives there.

502
00:38:05,500 --> 00:38:06,300
Really?

503
00:38:06,400 --> 00:38:09,200
Yeah.

504
00:38:09,300 --> 00:38:10,800
He was a pretty
good dude.

505
00:38:10,900 --> 00:38:12,900
What'd he teach?

506
00:38:13,000 --> 00:38:15,600
Marxist studies.

507
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,700
Marxist studies.

508
00:38:17,800 --> 00:38:19,800
Yup.

509
00:38:19,900 --> 00:38:26,400
He introduced me
to some pretty
out there concepts.

510
00:38:26,500 --> 00:38:30,900
Some pretty
radical ideas.

511
00:38:31,000 --> 00:38:36,400
So,
Were you, like,
seeing him?

512
00:38:37,900 --> 00:38:39,800
What do you mean,
"seeing him?"

513
00:38:39,900 --> 00:38:45,300
Were you
seeing him?

514
00:38:45,300 --> 00:38:47,100
Do you mean
like dating him?

515
00:38:47,100 --> 00:38:48,300
Yeah.

516
00:38:48,400 --> 00:38:51,200
Ew! He was a fucking
Marxist, man!

517
00:38:51,200 --> 00:38:52,800
Marxist?

518
00:38:52,800 --> 00:38:56,500
Why would you even
ask something
like that?

519
00:38:56,500 --> 00:38:57,500
Oh.

520
00:39:02,000 --> 00:39:04,000
There's a space.

521
00:39:04,100 --> 00:39:04,900
Where?

522
00:39:05,000 --> 00:39:05,800
Right there, man!

523
00:39:08,800 --> 00:39:10,600
Come on, dude!
We don't want
to be late

524
00:39:10,700 --> 00:39:12,700
for that dentist
appointment of yours!

525
00:39:12,800 --> 00:39:14,300
U h, right, right.
Right.

526
00:39:15,300 --> 00:39:16,900
You comin'
or what?

527
00:39:24,700 --> 00:39:25,800
Yeah.

528
00:39:31,200 --> 00:39:33,700
So are
you scared?

529
00:39:33,800 --> 00:39:37,300
About what,
the dentist?

530
00:39:37,400 --> 00:39:41,200
No, I 'vet never really
been bothered by
going to the dentist.

531
00:39:41,300 --> 00:39:45,400
It would freak the shit
out of me right now
if I had to go in there.

532
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:48,300
I don't think
I could handle it.

533
00:39:48,400 --> 00:39:51,200
I kind of like it.

534
00:39:51,300 --> 00:39:55,300
I mean, it's not like
I 'm a masochist
or anything, it's just,

535
00:39:55,400 --> 00:39:59,400
well, in a way, it
makes me feel like,

536
00:39:59,500 --> 00:40:00,900
yeah,

537
00:40:01,000 --> 00:40:06,000
my teeth are being
taken care of,
you know?

538
00:40:06,100 --> 00:40:08,700
It make me feel...

539
00:40:08,800 --> 00:40:10,300
prosperous.

540
00:40:13,300 --> 00:40:15,600
I 'm sorry, were
you talking
about something?

541
00:40:15,700 --> 00:40:18,100
U m,

542
00:40:18,100 --> 00:40:20,200
Oh, yeah.
Great.

543
00:40:20,300 --> 00:40:25,100
It makes you
feel prosperous
or something.

544
00:40:34,000 --> 00:40:35,800
I'm bored.

545
00:40:37,800 --> 00:40:39,200
Ericson?

546
00:40:39,300 --> 00:40:41,000
That's me.

547
00:40:41,100 --> 00:40:44,800
Okay, I guess
I will see you
in a little bit.

548
00:40:47,400 --> 00:40:50,500
Till we
meet again

549
00:40:53,000 --> 00:40:54,400
Okay.

550
00:41:01,000 --> 00:41:03,600
He's not
my boyfriend
or anything.

551
00:41:03,600 --> 00:41:05,300
Just a friend.

552
00:41:05,400 --> 00:41:11,100
I n case you were
wondering what my
relationship to him was.

553
00:41:11,200 --> 00:41:12,600
Or not.

554
00:41:39,800 --> 00:41:43,000
How's it going?

555
00:42:19,300 --> 00:42:20,700
Thanks, Gina.

556
00:42:20,800 --> 00:42:25,100
Oh! Thank
fucking God!

557
00:42:25,100 --> 00:42:28,700
This has been
the longest, dullest...

558
00:42:28,800 --> 00:42:32,700
most uncomfortable
thing I can remember
ever doing.

559
00:42:32,700 --> 00:42:36,100
I really thought
I was gonna die
of boredom.

560
00:42:36,200 --> 00:42:37,700
I gotta pay still.

561
00:42:37,700 --> 00:42:41,900
Oh, come on.
Can't we go already?

562
00:42:53,500 --> 00:42:56,000
Hey, Jane. What time
do you think it was

563
00:42:56,100 --> 00:42:57,100
that I picked you?

564
00:43:02,500 --> 00:43:04,100
What was that?

565
00:43:07,200 --> 00:43:09,500
Hey.

566
00:43:09,600 --> 00:43:13,300
Why don't you come
over here while your
friend's talking to you?

567
00:43:16,200 --> 00:43:18,300
Young lady,
come here.

568
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,100
Come here!

569
00:43:36,500 --> 00:43:37,700
Look at me.

570
00:43:39,500 --> 00:43:41,400
Look at me.
I 'm not playing
games here.

571
00:43:43,200 --> 00:43:48,200
It's really bright
out, officer.

572
00:43:48,200 --> 00:43:54,700
Would you mind
removing your hand
from your forehead?

573
00:43:54,800 --> 00:43:58,600
It's really
bright out.

574
00:43:58,700 --> 00:44:01,400
What's your name?

575
00:44:01,500 --> 00:44:02,500
U h...

576
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:06,700
Christy?

577
00:44:06,800 --> 00:44:09,700
You don't
sound too
sure of that.

578
00:44:09,800 --> 00:44:12,300
No, it's Christy.

579
00:44:12,400 --> 00:44:14,500
Well, Christy,

580
00:44:16,900 --> 00:44:20,600
how come your friend
just called you Jane
a second ago?

581
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:28,900
Jane's, uh, my...

582
00:44:28,900 --> 00:44:30,800
religious name?

583
00:44:32,900 --> 00:44:34,600
Your religious name?

584
00:44:34,700 --> 00:44:37,300
Am I
under arrest?

585
00:44:37,400 --> 00:44:39,400
Why would you be
under arrest?

586
00:44:39,500 --> 00:44:41,600
Have you done
something I should
know about?

587
00:44:41,700 --> 00:44:45,800
No, l... shit.
I mean, shoot!

588
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,400
Sir, do you mind
opening your
trunk for me?

589
00:44:53,500 --> 00:44:55,100
My trunk?

590
00:44:55,200 --> 00:45:03,400
No. Wait, excuse me.
We called you
because... my car...

591
00:45:07,700 --> 00:45:09,700
Now, Christy,

592
00:45:09,800 --> 00:45:16,000
am I gonna find
whatever kind of drugs
you're on in here?

593
00:45:16,100 --> 00:45:19,200
Christy.

594
00:45:19,300 --> 00:45:21,400
Chris-ty.

595
00:45:21,500 --> 00:45:24,400
Oh, Jesus
Christ, Jane!

596
00:45:24,400 --> 00:45:26,400
Yeah?

597
00:45:26,500 --> 00:45:28,300
Her name's
not Christy,
it's Jane.

598
00:45:28,300 --> 00:45:29,800
I don't even
know why you're
doing that.

599
00:45:29,800 --> 00:45:33,000
What do
you have
in here, son?

600
00:45:33,100 --> 00:45:34,900
I don't know.
Just some stuff.

601
00:45:35,000 --> 00:45:36,800
Folders that
I was supposed

602
00:45:36,900 --> 00:45:39,400
to bring to my dad's office
but didn't because
he's an ass.

603
00:45:39,500 --> 00:45:41,300
What's that?

604
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,300
A tennis racket.

605
00:45:43,400 --> 00:45:47,100
And that is a tennis ball.
I wish I had more, but
my dog eats them.

606
00:45:47,200 --> 00:45:49,600
Jack head,
paper clips,

607
00:45:51,800 --> 00:45:52,600
shoes,

608
00:46:33,100 --> 00:46:34,200
Hello.

609
00:46:34,300 --> 00:46:37,000
Hi.

610
00:46:37,100 --> 00:46:38,300
You're a
little early.

611
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:44,200
Well, are you
coming in
or what?

612
00:46:45,700 --> 00:46:46,700
H uh.

613
00:46:50,300 --> 00:46:53,800
Peter's not back
from the airport yet.

614
00:46:53,900 --> 00:46:58,200
So why don't you
just have a seat and
I'll go get it for you?

615
00:46:58,200 --> 00:46:59,400
Okay.

616
00:46:59,500 --> 00:47:02,200
Would you
like something
to drink?

617
00:47:02,300 --> 00:47:06,000
U h, do you have
any lemonade?

618
00:47:06,100 --> 00:47:11,400
Oh, no. I 'm sorry.
How about some
orange juice?

619
00:47:11,500 --> 00:47:14,900
Yeah, that sounds
good actually.

620
00:47:15,000 --> 00:47:17,600
All right.
Are you hungry?

621
00:47:17,700 --> 00:47:21,900
Well... now that
you mention it,

622
00:47:23,200 --> 00:47:25,500
I wouldn't mind
something to
munch on.

623
00:47:25,600 --> 00:47:27,700
You know,
like chips
or whatever.

624
00:47:27,800 --> 00:47:30,100
Well, let me
see what I
can find.

625
00:47:42,200 --> 00:47:43,800
Here we go.

626
00:47:43,800 --> 00:47:45,400
Thanks.

627
00:47:48,100 --> 00:47:49,600
What's with
the corn?

628
00:47:49,700 --> 00:47:52,300
Excuse me?

629
00:47:52,300 --> 00:47:54,700
Oh, that's
a photo
of Peter's.

630
00:47:54,800 --> 00:47:58,200
I suppose that's
his idea of avant
garde or something.

631
00:48:01,000 --> 00:48:04,000
How long
have you been
Peter's T.A.?

632
00:48:04,100 --> 00:48:05,000
Who?

633
00:48:05,100 --> 00:48:07,300
Peter.

634
00:48:07,400 --> 00:48:10,100
Oh, you mean
Professor Harwood.

635
00:48:10,200 --> 00:48:11,800
Yes.

636
00:48:11,900 --> 00:48:15,100
Well, for quite
a while now.

637
00:48:15,200 --> 00:48:19,300
I guess it didn't
work out with
that other girl.

638
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:21,500
I guess not.

639
00:48:21,600 --> 00:48:26,400
Well, it's very
nice to meet
you, uh...

640
00:48:29,200 --> 00:48:30,300
Jane.

641
00:48:30,400 --> 00:48:33,700
Jane. I 'm Shirley,
Peter's mother.

642
00:48:33,700 --> 00:48:37,500
Shirley, of course.
Peter talks about
you all the time.

643
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,600
He does?

644
00:48:39,600 --> 00:48:44,500
Oh, yeah.
Constantly.

645
00:48:55,500 --> 00:48:59,600
I'll just go and
get what you
came for,

646
00:48:59,600 --> 00:49:02,000
so that you can
be on your way.

647
00:49:05,600 --> 00:49:09,300
That is where
corn chips
come from.

648
00:49:09,300 --> 00:49:14,700
H mm, maybe old
Professor Harwood
is onto something.

649
00:49:14,800 --> 00:49:17,600
He probably
really loves corn,

650
00:49:17,700 --> 00:49:20,400
and all corn
related products.

651
00:49:20,500 --> 00:49:23,300
I mean, isn't that what
you're supposed to
put in a frame?

652
00:49:23,300 --> 00:49:24,600
Things you love?

653
00:49:24,700 --> 00:49:27,800
I'm gonna do that.
When I get home,

654
00:49:27,900 --> 00:49:30,600
I'm gonna frame
a bunch of stuff
I love.

655
00:49:30,700 --> 00:49:35,400
Like lasagna.
I love lasagna.

656
00:49:35,500 --> 00:49:41,300
It's so good,
and cheesy.

657
00:49:41,400 --> 00:49:45,800
You know who else
loves lasagna?
Garfield.

658
00:49:45,900 --> 00:49:49,800
Man, that cat really
loves lasagna.

659
00:49:49,900 --> 00:49:53,700
Maybe I should put
a picture of Garfield
in a frame.

660
00:49:53,800 --> 00:49:58,400
As a kind of shorthand
way of saying
I love lasagna.

661
00:49:58,400 --> 00:50:02,500
That would be
so fucking inside.

662
00:50:02,600 --> 00:50:06,800
Or how about a photo
of President Garfield?

663
00:50:06,800 --> 00:50:10,000
Oh, shit. That'd
be totally meta.

664
00:50:10,100 --> 00:50:13,000
People would be all like,
"Jane, why do you
have a photo

665
00:50:13,100 --> 00:50:15,200
of President Garfield
on your mantle?"

666
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:19,000
And I'd be like
"Because I like
lasagna, of course."

667
00:50:26,200 --> 00:50:30,200
Oh, my,
what happened?

668
00:50:30,200 --> 00:50:31,700
Did you fall?

669
00:50:33,700 --> 00:50:36,800
Yes, that's exactly
what happened.

670
00:50:36,900 --> 00:50:43,500
I was reaching
for something and
I kind of rolled off.

671
00:50:43,600 --> 00:50:46,200
Well, are you
all right?

672
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:47,900
Oh yeah,
I 'm fine.

673
00:50:48,000 --> 00:50:50,600
Are you hiding
from someone?

674
00:50:50,700 --> 00:50:53,400
Of course not.
Why would you
ask that?

675
00:50:53,500 --> 00:50:56,500
It seems like
you're hiding
from somebody.

676
00:50:56,500 --> 00:51:01,100
I don't know
what you're talking
about, Shirley.

677
00:51:04,600 --> 00:51:06,200
Well,

678
00:51:06,200 --> 00:51:07,600
here you go.

679
00:51:07,700 --> 00:51:11,500
Great. Thanks
a lot.

680
00:51:11,600 --> 00:51:14,400
Now I 'm sure
Peter's told
you this already,

681
00:51:14,500 --> 00:51:16,600
but he wanted me
to be sure to tell
you to take this

682
00:51:16,700 --> 00:51:19,500
straight to his office
and put it in the safe.

683
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:24,800
Oh, of course.

684
00:51:24,900 --> 00:51:26,900
Well, I guess
that's it then.

685
00:51:27,000 --> 00:51:28,300
Okay.

686
00:51:28,400 --> 00:51:30,300
See yah.

687
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:31,900
Holy fucking shit.

688
00:52:48,900 --> 00:52:50,200
Oh!

689
00:52:52,000 --> 00:52:53,000
Hi.

690
00:52:53,000 --> 00:52:54,300
Hi.

691
00:52:54,400 --> 00:52:59,800
I 'm just waiting
for my clothes
to dry.

692
00:53:02,800 --> 00:53:04,600
Those are
my clothes.

693
00:53:04,600 --> 00:53:10,700
Right. I 'm waiting
for your clothes
to dry, so that I can...

694
00:53:10,700 --> 00:53:14,600
dry my clothes.

695
00:53:14,700 --> 00:53:17,200
Where are
your clothes?

696
00:53:17,300 --> 00:53:19,800
I n my bathtub.

697
00:53:21,700 --> 00:53:23,100
Excuse me.

698
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:28,300
Hey,

699
00:53:28,400 --> 00:53:31,400
let me ask
you something.

700
00:53:31,500 --> 00:53:36,300
Suppose you had
a very rare...

701
00:53:36,400 --> 00:53:38,000
Let go of my arm.

702
00:53:38,100 --> 00:53:40,500
Sorry.

703
00:53:40,600 --> 00:53:43,100
We're cool.
We're just
talking here, right?

704
00:53:43,200 --> 00:53:44,300
Laundry buddies.

705
00:53:44,400 --> 00:53:46,100
Do you even live
in this building?

706
00:53:46,200 --> 00:53:50,400
That's not
relevant right now,
laundry buddy.

707
00:53:50,500 --> 00:53:56,100
Let's suppose
a person had in
their possession,

708
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:02,800
a very old...
very rare...

709
00:54:05,900 --> 00:54:06,900
book.

710
00:54:07,000 --> 00:54:08,400
What kind
of book?

711
00:54:08,500 --> 00:54:10,900
A very
influential book.

712
00:54:11,000 --> 00:54:14,500
A book
that has
changed history.

713
00:54:14,500 --> 00:54:17,200
I have no idea
what the fuck
you're talking about.

714
00:54:17,200 --> 00:54:20,900
Hey, dude.
What's with
the hostility?

715
00:54:20,900 --> 00:54:22,700
You give me
the creeps.

716
00:54:22,700 --> 00:54:24,000
The creeps?

717
00:54:24,100 --> 00:54:25,800
Take it
somewhere else

718
00:54:25,900 --> 00:54:27,300
before I call
the cops?

719
00:54:27,400 --> 00:54:31,400
Whoa! Hold
on there!

720
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:34,700
If you want
me to leave,
I can go.

721
00:54:34,800 --> 00:54:35,800
Thank you.

722
00:54:35,900 --> 00:54:37,600
I'm going, dude.

723
00:54:37,700 --> 00:54:39,500
Goodbye, dude.

724
00:54:41,800 --> 00:54:44,800
It's always me.

725
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:02,200
Sweet mother
of Christ.

726
00:55:05,300 --> 00:55:06,200
What 're
you doing?

727
00:55:06,300 --> 00:55:08,600
I 'm just,
I was trying...

728
00:55:08,700 --> 00:55:09,900
I'm calling
the cops.

729
00:55:10,000 --> 00:55:12,300
Hey, don't do that.

730
00:55:12,400 --> 00:55:15,100
I 'm gonna
give it back.
I swear!

731
00:55:15,200 --> 00:55:21,900
What use could I possibly
have for a musty
200-year old book?

732
00:55:22,000 --> 00:55:25,300
Don't put me
on hold I

733
00:55:25,400 --> 00:55:27,200
Hey!

734
00:55:27,300 --> 00:55:31,400
She's getting away I
I will find you ! I am
a Marine Reservist I

735
00:55:56,700 --> 00:55:58,800
Phew.

736
00:56:08,300 --> 00:56:09,400
No.

737
00:56:16,900 --> 00:56:19,400
Wow, do you
look fucked up.

738
00:56:19,500 --> 00:56:21,600
Come on, Hercules.

739
00:56:29,800 --> 00:56:32,000
A w, cute pig.

740
00:56:35,000 --> 00:56:36,900
The truck bed's open.

741
00:56:38,800 --> 00:56:40,600
It's headed west.

742
00:56:43,700 --> 00:56:45,100
To Venice.

743
00:56:48,900 --> 00:56:50,900
I don't see
the connection.

744
00:56:52,900 --> 00:56:57,700
Wait a minute.
It's coming to me.

745
00:57:02,100 --> 00:57:04,300
Buzz.

746
00:57:26,900 --> 00:57:29,600
It smells like
sausage in here.

747
00:57:37,900 --> 00:57:40,200
Time for a
revised plan.

748
00:57:42,300 --> 00:57:44,700
N umber one. ;
Get to that
Hemp Festival.

749
00:57:44,800 --> 00:57:49,400
N umber two. ; Try
to convince Steve
not to steal my furniture.

750
00:57:49,600 --> 00:57:52,500
Especially not
my bed.
Oh God.

751
00:57:52,600 --> 00:57:54,700
Anything but that.

752
00:57:58,100 --> 00:58:01,100
N umber three. ; Once
I've convinced Steve
not to steal my bed,

753
00:58:01,200 --> 00:58:03,900
try to figure out
a way to return the
Communist Manifesto

754
00:58:04,000 --> 00:58:08,000
without getting arrested.
Possibly via the
U. S. Postal Service.

755
00:58:08,000 --> 00:58:12,500
No, Global Express
is much more reliable.

756
00:58:12,600 --> 00:58:16,500
Now that sounds
like an awesome
revised plan.

757
00:58:22,400 --> 00:58:25,600
Next stop. ;
Venice, California.

758
00:58:45,300 --> 00:58:47,900
Holy shit I

759
00:58:47,900 --> 00:58:48,600
What?

760
00:58:53,800 --> 00:58:54,900
Dude.

761
00:59:08,700 --> 00:59:10,700
Are we in
Venice yet?

762
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:12,200
Venice?!

763
00:59:12,300 --> 00:59:16,400
Lady, we, we're
in fucking
El Monte.

764
00:59:16,400 --> 00:59:18,200
Where?

765
00:59:20,400 --> 00:59:22,100
Do you guys
kill pigs here?

766
00:59:22,100 --> 00:59:24,300
No, that happens
way before
they get here.

767
00:59:24,300 --> 00:59:27,100
We keep the pigs
on ice though, until
we need them.

768
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,100
Shut the fuck up.

769
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:31,200
Albert, she asked.

770
00:59:31,300 --> 00:59:33,500
Hey, fellas.

771
00:59:33,500 --> 00:59:35,000
Now you
did it.

772
00:59:35,100 --> 00:59:36,700
What are you
doing on the floor?

773
00:59:36,800 --> 00:59:38,500
Who the hell
are you?

774
00:59:38,600 --> 00:59:42,200
You know the rules, Mikey.
No girlfriends allowed
in the plant.

775
00:59:42,300 --> 00:59:44,700
Oh no, M r. Spencer,
this isn't my girl...

776
00:59:44,800 --> 00:59:48,700
I 'm not his
girlfriend, dude.
Believe me.

777
00:59:48,800 --> 00:59:53,300
Mikey, Albert,
would you mind
explaining to me

778
00:59:53,400 --> 00:59:54,600
what's going
on here?

779
00:59:54,700 --> 00:59:55,800
U h...

780
00:59:55,900 --> 00:59:57,700
I 'm here
to organize
a union.

781
00:59:57,700 --> 00:59:59,100
What?!

782
00:59:59,100 --> 01:00:02,000
That's right.
I always make
it a point

783
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:04,000
to get to know the
workers personally,

784
01:00:04,000 --> 01:00:07,400
and these two gentlemen
were kind enough to give
me a little tour.

785
01:00:07,500 --> 01:00:09,600
Albert, I thought
we cleared up

786
01:00:09,700 --> 01:00:12,100
all that union
nonsense last year.

787
01:00:12,200 --> 01:00:14,200
We did, sir.
I was just showing
her the way out.

788
01:00:14,300 --> 01:00:19,500
Look, M r. Spencer,
is it?

789
01:00:19,600 --> 01:00:24,600
How much stake do
you personally have
in this organization?

790
01:00:24,600 --> 01:00:27,100
Well, not that
it's any of
your business,

791
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:30,100
but I've got
a very generous
benefit package.

792
01:00:30,200 --> 01:00:35,200
A generous
benefit package.

793
01:00:35,300 --> 01:00:37,900
Listen to how quickly
the lackey adopts

794
01:00:38,000 --> 01:00:39,600
the language of
his master.

795
01:00:39,700 --> 01:00:43,200
Ma'am, I am going
to ask you one
time nicely.

796
01:00:43,300 --> 01:00:46,800
Tell your people
that we are
not interested.

797
01:00:46,900 --> 01:00:49,600
I'll tell my
people all right.

798
01:00:49,600 --> 01:00:52,600
But first, I have
a little message

799
01:00:52,700 --> 01:00:57,000
for you to tell
your people.

800
01:00:57,100 --> 01:00:59,800
You tell
your people

801
01:00:59,900 --> 01:01:04,200
the slaughterers of pigs,
the profiteering cowards

802
01:01:04,300 --> 01:01:07,100
who dishonestly hide
their dirty business

803
01:01:07,200 --> 01:01:11,700
behind a sweet, happy
logo of a cute pig,

804
01:01:11,800 --> 01:01:14,500
while they manufacture
misery and death.

805
01:01:14,600 --> 01:01:15,700
Ma'am.

806
01:01:15,800 --> 01:01:19,500
Please, sir, allow
me to finish.

807
01:01:19,600 --> 01:01:23,000
Just look around you.

808
01:01:23,000 --> 01:01:27,600
Do you see it?
Can you hear it?

809
01:01:29,100 --> 01:01:32,200
And you, sir,
stand here

810
01:01:32,300 --> 01:01:35,900
in this warehouse
of death!

811
01:01:35,900 --> 01:01:39,100
And you have
the audacity
to tell me

812
01:01:39,200 --> 01:01:45,600
that you have
a generous
benefit package?

813
01:01:45,600 --> 01:01:47,100
And them?

814
01:01:47,200 --> 01:01:52,800
Do they have
a generous
benefit package?

815
01:01:54,800 --> 01:01:59,500
I think we all know
the answer to that.
Don't we?

816
01:02:03,900 --> 01:02:07,800
It is a tale
as old as man.

817
01:02:07,800 --> 01:02:12,600
The history
of all hither to
existing society,

818
01:02:12,700 --> 01:02:14,600
is the history
of class struggle.

819
01:02:14,700 --> 01:02:18,800
The free man and slave,
the lord and serf,

820
01:02:18,900 --> 01:02:22,400
in a word, oppressor
and oppressed,

821
01:02:22,500 --> 01:02:26,800
stood in constant
opposition to
one another,

822
01:02:26,800 --> 01:02:30,000
carrying on an
uninterrupted fight.

823
01:02:30,100 --> 01:02:32,500
A fight that each
time ended

824
01:02:32,600 --> 01:02:38,000
in either revolutionary
reconstitution of
society at large,

825
01:02:38,100 --> 01:02:45,600
or in a complete
and total ruin!

826
01:02:48,000 --> 01:02:50,100
You tell your
people that!

827
01:02:56,600 --> 01:03:01,000
You think you're
so, um, uh...

828
01:03:01,100 --> 01:03:06,500
Jesus! And then you go
on and on about
this and that

829
01:03:06,600 --> 01:03:10,500
and all this other
bullshit and all I
have to say is

830
01:03:10,500 --> 01:03:17,000
fuck, man! I mean,
this situation is
totally fucked.

831
01:03:17,000 --> 01:03:23,500
With a capital!
I mean, have
you ever...

832
01:03:23,600 --> 01:03:26,200
Do you like even...

833
01:03:27,500 --> 01:03:28,700
Well, do you?

834
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,000
You tell your
people that.

835
01:03:34,100 --> 01:03:36,800
Ohhh!

836
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:37,800
Ow.

837
01:03:45,000 --> 01:03:48,100
Meet me in
Venice at three.

838
01:03:48,200 --> 01:03:51,800
Take this straight to his
office and put it in the safe.

839
01:03:51,900 --> 01:03:54,500
I'd probably take
your furniture.

840
01:03:54,500 --> 01:03:57,800
Are you trying to
sell me drugs?

841
01:03:57,900 --> 01:04:00,100
Young lady,
come here.

842
01:04:00,100 --> 01:04:02,600
Jane. Jane!

843
01:04:02,700 --> 01:04:05,400
You give me
the creeps.

844
01:04:05,500 --> 01:04:10,600
Christy. Psst.
Chris-ty

845
01:04:10,700 --> 01:04:16,000
Psst. Jesus!
Jane. Hey. Jane.

846
01:04:16,100 --> 01:04:17,600
Jane.

847
01:04:23,100 --> 01:04:26,100
Hey.

848
01:04:26,200 --> 01:04:30,700
What are
you doing?

849
01:04:30,700 --> 01:04:33,400
I don't even know
where I am.

850
01:04:33,400 --> 01:04:35,600
Do you
want a ride?

851
01:04:35,700 --> 01:04:38,900
N umber one. ; Get to
that Hemp Festival.

852
01:04:39,000 --> 01:04:41,500
So you like
to smoke a lot
of weed, huh?

853
01:04:45,600 --> 01:04:47,500
Not really.

854
01:05:02,000 --> 01:05:04,800
So are you like
a Communist
or something?

855
01:05:04,900 --> 01:05:09,700
No, man.
I 'm not
a Communist.

856
01:05:09,800 --> 01:05:12,900
What's in Venice that
you've got to go all
the way out there for?

857
01:05:15,700 --> 01:05:19,900
I 'm supposed to
be meeting someone.

858
01:05:19,900 --> 01:05:20,900
H mm.

859
01:05:21,000 --> 01:05:23,300
Can I ask
you something?

860
01:05:23,300 --> 01:05:24,600
Sure.

861
01:05:24,700 --> 01:05:28,500
If you could,
with a single act,

862
01:05:28,600 --> 01:05:32,400
change the whole
trajectory of your
life, would you do it?

863
01:05:32,500 --> 01:05:35,200
The trajectory
of my life?

864
01:05:35,300 --> 01:05:41,700
Yeah, the direction your
life is headed in.
Where you're going.

865
01:05:41,800 --> 01:05:46,200
U h, I don't
know. U m,

866
01:05:46,200 --> 01:05:50,000
I guess not.
I've got a good
job. Why?

867
01:05:50,100 --> 01:05:55,100
I 'm thinking about
changing the trajectory
of my life, that's all.

868
01:05:55,200 --> 01:05:58,200
That's cool.

869
01:05:58,300 --> 01:06:05,300
God. I get so horny
when I 'm stoned.

870
01:06:05,400 --> 01:06:06,800
What?

871
01:06:06,800 --> 01:06:09,900
Pot makes me
so fucking horny.

872
01:06:10,000 --> 01:06:11,500
Does it have
that affect on you?

873
01:06:11,600 --> 01:06:13,900
I 'm not stoned
right now. But...

874
01:06:14,000 --> 01:06:17,700
Let's just fuck.
Right here,
right now,

875
01:06:17,800 --> 01:06:21,400
I n the car. I n the
middle of this
fucking traffic jam.

876
01:06:21,500 --> 01:06:23,500
I don't want
to get in
an accident.

877
01:06:23,500 --> 01:06:25,700
Come on, Mikey.
Fuck me.

878
01:06:25,800 --> 01:06:29,100
Fuck me right now.
You know you want to.

879
01:06:29,100 --> 01:06:32,000
Come on, Mikey.
Fuck me!

880
01:06:32,100 --> 01:06:34,900
Fuck me! Yeah I
Fuck me!

881
01:06:37,100 --> 01:06:39,600
Fuck me!
Oh, yeah!

882
01:06:39,700 --> 01:06:42,500
Come on!
Fuck me, Mikey!

883
01:06:47,700 --> 01:06:49,000
This traffic
sucks, huh?

884
01:06:50,700 --> 01:06:51,600
H uh?

885
01:06:51,700 --> 01:06:54,200
This traffic...
It sucks.

886
01:06:54,200 --> 01:06:57,900
Oh, yeah.

887
01:06:57,900 --> 01:07:00,000
Right.

888
01:07:00,000 --> 01:07:00,800
H mm.

889
01:07:28,500 --> 01:07:30,600
Oh, my God! No!
I got to go!

890
01:07:30,700 --> 01:07:32,600
We're on the freeway.
What are you doing?

891
01:07:32,600 --> 01:07:35,100
I have to stop
my dealer from
stealing my bed!

892
01:07:35,200 --> 01:07:36,600
What are you
talking about?

893
01:07:36,600 --> 01:07:39,000
There's no time to...
I gotta... Bye!

894
01:07:39,100 --> 01:07:41,600
Jane!
Jane!

895
01:07:41,700 --> 01:07:44,700
Where the hell
are you going?

896
01:07:44,800 --> 01:07:45,800
Jane!

897
01:07:50,000 --> 01:07:53,400
N umber two. ;
Try to convince Steve
not to steal my bed.

898
01:08:09,800 --> 01:08:14,100
You shouldn't be
walking on the
freeway. It's dangerous.

899
01:08:17,500 --> 01:08:18,900
I guess.

900
01:08:18,900 --> 01:08:19,900
Where are
you headed?

901
01:08:20,000 --> 01:08:21,600
Venice.

902
01:08:21,700 --> 01:08:23,800
That's where
I'm going.

903
01:08:23,900 --> 01:08:25,100
I'll give
you a lift.

904
01:08:35,000 --> 01:08:35,900
Hold on.

905
01:09:11,500 --> 01:09:15,600
Well, I hope you find
whatever it is you're
looking for.

906
01:09:15,700 --> 01:09:18,400
Thanks.
You too.

907
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:31,400
She was nice.

908
01:09:37,300 --> 01:09:41,600
Carrot Top!

909
01:10:02,300 --> 01:10:06,500
Excuse me, did you
just come from
the Hemp Fest?

910
01:10:06,500 --> 01:10:09,300
No, man. I 'm
from Bethlehem.

911
01:10:09,400 --> 01:10:11,000
Oh, sorry.

912
01:10:11,100 --> 01:10:14,100
Dude, I 'm just
fucking with you.
But it's kind of over.

913
01:10:14,200 --> 01:10:16,100
What?

914
01:10:16,100 --> 01:10:18,800
You're a bong
hit late.
It's done-ski.

915
01:10:19,900 --> 01:10:21,500
No!

916
01:10:32,000 --> 01:10:37,200
Hey, is this the
Thirty-third Annual
Venice Hemp Fest?

917
01:10:37,300 --> 01:10:39,400
Not any more.

918
01:10:39,500 --> 01:10:42,500
Oh, you've got
to be kidding me!

919
01:10:42,600 --> 01:10:44,700
I 'm supposed to meet
my dealer here.

920
01:10:44,800 --> 01:10:46,700
Do you know him?
H is name's Steve.

921
01:10:46,800 --> 01:10:50,200
Steve? Oh, yeah!

922
01:10:50,200 --> 01:10:54,300
Is he a dude, he's
got like two arms,
two legs,

923
01:10:54,300 --> 01:10:55,900
And a head.

924
01:10:58,100 --> 01:10:59,800
That's Steve.
Yeah.

925
01:10:59,900 --> 01:11:01,300
Forget it.

926
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:10,600
Have a fun ride.

927
01:13:47,400 --> 01:13:49,000
I n that moment,

928
01:13:50,600 --> 01:13:52,800
perched high
above the earth,

929
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:56,500
high above those
who had come so
far to find her,

930
01:13:56,600 --> 01:14:00,800
Jane knew what
she had to do.

931
01:14:02,900 --> 01:14:05,900
Jane was
no schemer,
no conniver,

932
01:14:06,000 --> 01:14:07,700
no thief.

933
01:14:10,300 --> 01:14:15,900
Jane knew that
deep down she
was pure of heart.

934
01:14:15,900 --> 01:14:18,000
And that she
did not want
to contribute

935
01:14:18,000 --> 01:14:22,500
to the toll of human
misery and suffering
in the world.

936
01:14:23,900 --> 01:14:25,900
She knew
the time
had come

937
01:14:25,900 --> 01:14:29,000
to take responsibility
for what she'd done,

938
01:14:29,000 --> 01:14:32,900
and to return
the book to its
rightful owner.

939
01:14:33,000 --> 01:14:38,200
That her intentions
were honorable, that
there'd be no doubt.

940
01:14:38,300 --> 01:14:44,000
But what puzzled many
on that day was not the
virtue of her intentions.

941
01:14:44,000 --> 01:14:46,600
Hey!

942
01:14:46,700 --> 01:14:49,900
What puzzled
many was why.

943
01:14:50,000 --> 01:14:53,400
Hey!

944
01:14:55,500 --> 01:14:58,700
By what bizarre
and convoluted logic,

945
01:14:58,800 --> 01:15:00,900
did she arrive
at the decision
to do

946
01:15:01,000 --> 01:15:04,200
what you're
about to see?

947
01:15:04,200 --> 01:15:09,300
I n short,
what the fuck
was she thinking?

948
01:15:09,400 --> 01:15:14,700
- Whoa!
- Hey!

949
01:15:14,800 --> 01:15:17,000
U p here!

950
01:15:17,100 --> 01:15:20,200
Brevin!
I'm up here!

951
01:15:27,000 --> 01:15:28,500
Oh no.

952
01:15:51,900 --> 01:15:56,600
Heyyy!

953
01:16:05,000 --> 01:16:05,900
Ohhh!

954
01:16:07,300 --> 01:16:08,000
Help.

955
01:17:40,300 --> 01:17:42,100
Whoa.

956
01:18:33,100 --> 01:18:36,500
So, my dad plays
golf with this guy,

957
01:18:36,600 --> 01:18:40,600
who is a pretty good
criminal attorney.

958
01:18:40,700 --> 01:18:42,900
I think he's
a criminal attorney.

959
01:18:42,900 --> 01:18:44,500
He's definitely
a lawyer.

960
01:18:44,600 --> 01:18:48,100
I could try to hook
you up with him
if you want.

961
01:18:48,200 --> 01:18:51,700
Yeah, that
sounds good.

962
01:18:55,800 --> 01:19:01,300
Well, Brevin, it sure
has been a fucking
day, huh?

963
01:19:02,800 --> 01:19:05,900
Yeah, I guess.

964
01:20:14,500 --> 01:20:18,200
What a weird
fucking dream.

965
01:20:21,600 --> 01:20:25,200
Hey, stoner!
Back to work!

966
01:20:29,200 --> 01:20:31,400
Sorry.

967
01:20:31,500 --> 01:20:34,900
This has been the story
of how a person started at A,

968
01:20:35,000 --> 01:20:38,300
got to Z, and
somehow ended up

969
01:20:38,400 --> 01:20:42,300
collecting garbage
by the side of
the freeway.

970
01:20:42,400 --> 01:20:46,500
And I think you'll all
agree that much like
life itself,

971
01:20:46,700 --> 01:20:52,900
it certainly has
been... one hell
of a crazy ride.
