00:06:28,802 --> 00:06:30,838
I... I got something.

187
00:06:30,873 --> 00:06:32,184
Hit me.

188
00:06:32,219 --> 00:06:36,948
Um, what about
a hunky Santa doll?

189
00:06:36,982 --> 00:06:38,777
You know,
for the teen market.

190
00:06:38,812 --> 00:06:39,778
Um, I think

191
00:06:39,813 --> 00:06:40,952
that was my idea.

192
00:06:40,986 --> 00:06:42,056
Since when?

193
00:06:42,091 --> 00:06:43,782
Yesterday,
by the water coolers?

194
00:06:43,817 --> 00:06:45,612
Oh, I thought you were
talking about your date.

195
00:06:45,646 --> 00:06:46,923
Yeah, I was.

196
00:06:46,958 --> 00:06:49,926
A hunky Santa doll.

197
00:06:51,756 --> 00:06:52,653
Yeah.

198
00:06:55,725 --> 00:06:57,037
You might have something there.

199
00:06:57,071 --> 00:06:59,557
Hmm? Huh?

200
00:06:59,591 --> 00:07:01,041
Huh?

201
00:07:01,075 --> 00:07:03,492
That's more
like it.

202
00:07:06,011 --> 00:07:07,081
So get busy!

203
00:07:09,014 --> 00:07:11,741
[♪♪♪]

204
00:07:16,263 --> 00:07:18,783
So we'll have two stopovers
before we fly into Nunavut,

205
00:07:18,817 --> 00:07:19,887
and then after that,

206
00:07:19,922 --> 00:07:21,199
Uncle Mario is going
to pick us up

207
00:07:21,233 --> 00:07:22,718
and drive us
the rest of the way up north.

208
00:07:22,752 --> 00:07:24,513
It's a bit of a trek,

209
00:07:24,547 --> 00:07:26,515
but we should make
good time in Dad's car.

210
00:07:26,549 --> 00:07:28,033
Connor? Your lunch?

211
00:07:29,034 --> 00:07:30,829
Right, yeah. Yeah, thank you.

212
00:07:31,761 --> 00:07:32,659
Are you okay?

213
00:07:32,693 --> 00:07:33,970
Yeah.

214
00:07:34,005 --> 00:07:35,040
Yeah,
everything's fine.

215
00:07:35,075 --> 00:07:36,835
Okay.

216
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:39,838
Ahem.

217
00:07:39,873 --> 00:07:41,081
Way to go, Connor.

218
00:07:41,115 --> 00:07:42,531
Yeah,
thanks a lot.

219
00:07:42,565 --> 00:07:43,670
The Christmas party
was my only chance

220
00:07:43,704 --> 00:07:44,912
with Deb
from accounting.

221
00:07:44,947 --> 00:07:46,086
Yeah, in your dreams, Wesley.

222
00:07:46,120 --> 00:07:48,744
Dreams can
become reality.

223
00:07:48,778 --> 00:07:50,780
What's going on?

224
00:07:50,815 --> 00:07:51,919
Ah, Wegman canceled
the Christmas party

225
00:07:51,954 --> 00:07:53,921
thanks to me
and my toy.

226
00:07:53,956 --> 00:07:55,785
Oh, Connor.

227
00:07:55,820 --> 00:07:57,097
Yeah, I don't know what it is,

228
00:07:57,131 --> 00:07:58,063
but I just can't
get the kids interested

229
00:07:58,098 --> 00:07:58,926
these days.

230
00:07:58,961 --> 00:08:00,031
And all Wegman wants

231
00:08:00,065 --> 00:08:01,791
is, like, some
flash-pan toy

232
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,172
like
a hulky Christmas Santa doll,

233
00:08:03,206 --> 00:08:04,967
and that's popular,
you know, in the moment,

234
00:08:05,001 --> 00:08:06,865
but it doesn't stand
the test of time,

235
00:08:06,900 --> 00:08:08,833
not like the toys
that I make.

236
00:08:08,867 --> 00:08:10,179
Well,

237
00:08:10,213 --> 00:08:13,769
maybe you'll get inspired
at my parents' place.

Yeah! I think
that's him.

-Okay.

How ya doin'?

245
00:08:44,662 --> 00:08:46,905
I couldn't be better.

246
00:08:46,940 --> 00:08:49,287
Well, you still look
pretty as a snowflake.

247
00:08:49,321 --> 00:08:51,082
Although, you know,

248
00:08:51,116 --> 00:08:53,049
you could put a little sugar
on your bones.

249
00:08:53,084 --> 00:08:54,568
Aw...

250
00:08:54,603 --> 00:08:57,053
Well, Mario,
this is my boyfriend, Connor.

251
00:08:57,088 --> 00:08:58,572
Nice to meet you, Mario.

252
00:08:58,607 --> 00:09:01,230
Yeah, well,
he's, uh, skinny, too.

Oh, well,
no worries...

We got lots of goodies at home
to fatten you both up

256
00:09:06,615 --> 00:09:07,961
for Christmas.

257
00:09:07,995 --> 00:09:10,860

Geez, you weren't kidding, eh,

00:09:22,182 --> 00:09:25,254
when you said your parents
live up north.

[chuckles awkwardly]

262
00:09:26,289 --> 00:09:27,256
So, uh,

263
00:09:27,290 --> 00:09:29,983
how long
till we get there?

264
00:09:30,017 --> 00:09:31,087
Oh, it, uh...

265
00:09:31,122 --> 00:09:32,606
shouldn't be
that much longer.

266
00:09:32,641 --> 00:09:36,645
Uh, here, try some of my
special hot cocoa.

Oh, yes, please.

Yeah,
it's a home brew.

Oh, thank you.

Mm, smells delicious.

00:10:02,394 --> 00:10:03,603

00:10:04,811 --> 00:10:06,122
That's, like, some good hock.

All right, Jingles.

00:10:14,752 --> 00:10:15,994
Are you ready to go home?

00:10:16,029 --> 00:10:17,340
Ready.

00:10:17,375 --> 00:10:20,723
Wow, Mario,
you've sure souped up this ride.

we don't get a lot
of visitors up here,

a bit excited.

it was "Klaus".

hitting the snooze button.

for a tour?

Are you sure, Dad?

There's not much to see,
is there?

00:12:05,448 --> 00:12:06,898
Well, don't worry,
I'll give Connor the short tour.

I was a little
surprised to hear

330

that you were
bringing Connor up with you.

I think he's
planning to propose.

What about Jack?

Well, you always seemed
like such a good fit.

00:12:54,463 --> 00:12:57,086
Plus he knows your family
and the business,

343

not to mention
he's already prepared.

Are you sure
that Connor's the one?

Oh, yes, Mom.

00:13:07,856 --> 00:13:10,582
He's everything that
I could have wished for.

347
00:13:10,617 --> 00:13:16,174
He's kind, and he's generous,
and he adores kids.

He even makes toys
for a living.

he'll do fine.

are reindeer.

00:14:08,261 --> 00:14:09,503
What do you use them for?

370
00:14:09,538 --> 00:14:10,539
Well...

371
00:14:10,573 --> 00:14:11,609
We use them for the sleigh!

372
00:14:11,643 --> 00:14:13,231
Rides!

373
00:14:13,266 --> 00:14:15,578
My parents own
a lot of property up here,

374
00:14:15,613 --> 00:14:17,063
and they like to give
authentic sleigh rides

375
00:14:17,097 --> 00:14:17,960
to the visitors.

376
00:14:17,995 --> 00:14:18,892
Right, Dad?

377
00:14:20,411 --> 00:14:21,653
Something like that.

378
00:14:21,688 --> 00:14:23,241
What?

379
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:25,174
I thought you said
you didn't get many visitors.

380
00:14:25,209 --> 00:14:27,694
Gosh, guys, we are going
to get in trouble

381
00:14:27,728 --> 00:14:28,937
if we make dinner
cold.

382
00:14:28,971 --> 00:14:31,387
Chop, chop.

383
00:14:31,422 --> 00:14:32,630
Come on.

384
00:14:32,664 --> 00:14:33,665
[chuckles]

385
00:14:37,497 --> 00:14:40,396
Oh, will you look at that.

386
00:14:40,431 --> 00:14:41,397
Wow.

387
00:14:41,432 --> 00:14:42,916
[chuckling]

388
00:14:42,951 --> 00:14:45,160
So, what we have here now

389
00:14:45,194 --> 00:14:47,403
is beef tenderloin
with chocolate sauce,

390
00:14:47,438 --> 00:14:49,164
sugared carrots,

391
00:14:49,198 --> 00:14:50,924
and Holly's favorite dessert,

392
00:14:50,959 --> 00:14:52,167
a holiday trifle.

393
00:14:52,201 --> 00:14:54,031
Welcome home, darling.

394
00:14:54,065 --> 00:14:54,997
Thank you, Mom.

395
00:14:55,032 --> 00:14:57,103
[chuckles]

396
00:14:57,137 --> 00:14:58,242
Should we wait
for your uncle Mario?

397
00:14:58,276 --> 00:14:59,415
Oh, no, don't worry about him.

398
00:14:59,450 --> 00:15:00,589
He's probably
just tinkering away

399
00:15:00,623 --> 00:15:01,693
on something
down in the factory...

400
00:15:01,728 --> 00:15:04,524
[coughs loudly, clears throat]

401
00:15:04,558 --> 00:15:06,595
So I have some good news.

402
00:15:06,629 --> 00:15:09,149
I am officially
a part of the veterinary team

403
00:15:09,184 --> 00:15:10,633
at Secord clinic.

404
00:15:10,668 --> 00:15:11,945
[Mom gasps]

405
00:15:11,980 --> 00:15:13,740
Ho, ho, ho,
that is something!

406
00:15:13,774 --> 00:15:15,190
It is.

407
00:15:15,224 --> 00:15:16,191
She's incredible,
actually.

408
00:15:16,225 --> 00:15:18,020
She just has such a way

409
00:15:18,055 --> 00:15:19,125
with animals.

410
00:15:19,159 --> 00:15:20,264
That's my girl.

411
00:15:21,679 --> 00:15:23,025
And so, Connor,

412
00:15:23,060 --> 00:15:24,682
what do you do
to keep yourself busy?

413
00:15:24,716 --> 00:15:27,029
Oh, I work
for a toy manufacturer.

414
00:15:27,064 --> 00:15:28,272
Wegman's.

415
00:15:28,306 --> 00:15:30,205
You guys ever
heard of it?

416
00:15:30,239 --> 00:15:30,999
[Nick]: Wegman's...

417
00:15:31,033 --> 00:15:32,207
I may have.

418
00:15:32,241 --> 00:15:33,691
Oh, the elves would know...

419
00:15:33,725 --> 00:15:36,521
Connor is an amazing
toy creator.

420
00:15:36,556 --> 00:15:38,385
Aren't you, Connor?

421
00:15:38,420 --> 00:15:40,525
Oh, well, I mean,
I'd hardly say that.

422
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:42,320
My last idea
actually tanked so bad

423
00:15:42,355 --> 00:15:45,530
that Mr. Wegman
canceled the Christmas party.

424
00:15:45,565 --> 00:15:47,049
Well, bah humbug to that!

425
00:15:47,084 --> 00:15:49,051
You give me
his whole name

426
00:15:49,086 --> 00:15:51,536
and I will put him
on the naughty list.

427
00:15:51,571 --> 00:15:55,161
[exaggerated laugh]

428
00:15:55,195 --> 00:15:57,163
More carrots?

429
00:15:57,197 --> 00:15:58,716
I've got to say,

430
00:15:58,750 --> 00:16:00,545
I've never thought to put beef
and chocolate together,

431
00:16:00,580 --> 00:16:02,168
but that was delicious.

432
00:16:02,202 --> 00:16:03,514
You can't go wrong
with chocolate.

433
00:16:03,548 --> 00:16:04,722
[Snowball barks]
No, apparently not.

434
00:16:04,756 --> 00:16:06,689
What is it, Snowball?

435
00:16:06,724 --> 00:16:07,759
Oh, he wants you
to go outside

436
00:16:07,794 --> 00:16:09,071
and throw the ball
to him.

437
00:16:09,106 --> 00:16:09,796
It's his
favorite game.

438
00:16:09,830 --> 00:16:11,453
Oh.

439
00:16:11,487 --> 00:16:15,802
Well, in that case, huh,
let's go chuck some ball.

440
00:16:15,836 --> 00:16:17,631
Whoa, whoa.

441
00:16:17,666 --> 00:16:18,632
[Snowball barks]

442
00:16:18,667 --> 00:16:21,083
I need a jacket.

443
00:16:21,118 --> 00:16:23,120
Where's Snowball?

444
00:16:23,154 --> 00:16:24,397
I need my slippers.

445
00:16:24,431 --> 00:16:25,777
Oh, Connor took him outside
to throw the ball.

446
00:16:25,812 --> 00:16:27,469
Oh, did you tell him

447
00:16:27,503 --> 00:16:29,091
not to throw it
to the back of the house

448
00:16:29,126 --> 00:16:30,403
where all the lights
are hooked up?

449
00:16:30,437 --> 00:16:32,474
[gasps]

450
00:16:34,303 --> 00:16:36,029
[Holly]: Connor!

451
00:16:39,377 --> 00:16:40,447
[knocking on door]

452
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:42,622
Connor?

453
00:16:44,313 --> 00:16:45,418
I brought you
some trifle.

454
00:16:45,452 --> 00:16:46,281
Oh, thank you.

455
00:16:46,315 --> 00:16:48,076
What are you
doing?

456
00:16:48,110 --> 00:16:51,320
I was seeing
if I had any messages from work,

457
00:16:51,355 --> 00:16:53,115
but I can't seem
to get a signal up here.

458
00:16:53,150 --> 00:16:54,289
Oh, well.

459
00:16:55,669 --> 00:16:56,636
Hey, did your parents
get those lights

460
00:16:56,670 --> 00:16:57,602
back up and running?

461
00:16:57,637 --> 00:16:58,810
Mario's
working on it.

462
00:16:58,845 --> 00:16:59,777
I'm sure they'll be
back up and running

463
00:16:59,811 --> 00:17:01,365
by the morning.

464
00:17:01,399 --> 00:17:02,435
I feel like
I should go help him.

465
00:17:02,469 --> 00:17:03,781
No, no, no, no.

466
00:17:03,815 --> 00:17:06,370
Mario likes doing
that kind of thing.

467
00:17:06,404 --> 00:17:09,131
So I made a great
first impression, huh?

468
00:17:09,166 --> 00:17:12,652
Of course you did.

469
00:17:12,686 --> 00:17:14,240
You didn't know
that Snowball

470
00:17:14,274 --> 00:17:16,449
was going to go running
through those cords.

471
00:17:16,483 --> 00:17:18,451
[sighs]

472
00:17:18,485 --> 00:17:19,452
No.

473
00:17:19,486 --> 00:17:21,557
[chuckles]

474
00:17:23,421 --> 00:17:24,457
Come on.

475
00:17:24,491 --> 00:17:25,699
I've got something

476
00:17:25,734 --> 00:17:28,219
that I think
will cheer you up.

477
00:17:30,773 --> 00:17:31,774
[Connor]:
Where are you going?

478
00:17:31,809 --> 00:17:32,810
Just follow me.

479
00:17:32,844 --> 00:17:34,087
[panting]

480
00:17:37,125 --> 00:17:38,712
Are you sure this
is structurally sound?

481
00:17:38,747 --> 00:17:40,197
[chuckles]

482
00:17:46,582 --> 00:17:48,584
Look.

483
00:17:49,758 --> 00:17:51,829
Whoa...

484
00:17:53,934 --> 00:17:55,143
What is that?

485
00:17:55,177 --> 00:17:57,490
The Northern Lights.

486
00:17:57,524 --> 00:17:58,767
The North Pole

487
00:17:58,801 --> 00:18:01,425
is one of the best places
to see them.

488
00:18:01,459 --> 00:18:02,702
The North Pole?

489
00:18:02,736 --> 00:18:04,773
This is the North Pole?

490
00:18:06,844 --> 00:18:08,363
I told you that,
right?

491
00:18:08,397 --> 00:18:11,918
I... I could have sworn
I told you at lunch...

492
00:18:11,952 --> 00:18:13,609
No.

493
00:18:13,644 --> 00:18:14,886
No, no, no, you said
that your parents lived,

494
00:18:14,921 --> 00:18:16,681
like, way, way, way
up north.

495
00:18:16,716 --> 00:18:19,512
You didn't say
they lived this far.

496
00:18:19,546 --> 00:18:21,893
Well...
Here we are.

497
00:18:21,928 --> 00:18:23,688
I hope that's okay?

498
00:18:27,313 --> 00:18:29,177
It's okay.

499
00:18:30,971 --> 00:18:31,834
No, I love it.

500
00:18:31,869 --> 00:18:33,767
It's like

501
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:35,700
there's something magical
about it all, don't you think?

502
00:18:35,735 --> 00:18:36,632
Oh, yeah, yeah.

503
00:18:36,667 --> 00:18:38,738
It's magical.

504
00:18:38,772 --> 00:18:40,533
Yeah.

505
00:18:43,881 --> 00:18:45,469
I love you, Connor.

506
00:18:50,922 --> 00:18:51,682
[elves giggling nearby]

507
00:18:51,716 --> 00:18:53,270
What was that?

508
00:18:53,304 --> 00:18:55,962
What was what?

509
00:18:55,996 --> 00:18:57,550
It kind of sounded
like a kid.

510
00:18:57,584 --> 00:18:58,896
[nervous chuckle]

511
00:18:58,930 --> 00:19:00,691
-Connor, look! A shooting star!
-What? Where?

512
00:19:00,725 --> 00:19:02,313
-[Connor]: Whoa!
-[elf]: Ow!

513
00:19:02,348 --> 00:19:04,522
Look at that.
That's crazy!

514
00:19:05,661 --> 00:19:07,629
I've never seen anything
like that before.

515
00:19:07,663 --> 00:19:09,907
That was, like, pfff!

516
00:19:09,941 --> 00:19:11,219
Well, it's like
you said,

517
00:19:11,253 --> 00:19:14,705
it's, uh,
pretty magical up here.

518
00:19:14,739 --> 00:19:16,258
Yeah.

519
00:19:17,777 --> 00:19:20,297
Maybe we should go
back inside.

520
00:19:20,331 --> 00:19:22,747
It's... brrr!

521
00:19:23,645 --> 00:19:25,888
Okay.

522
00:19:31,860 --> 00:19:32,895
-[thump, thump!]
-Whoa... Whoa!

523
00:19:32,930 --> 00:19:33,931
I'm okay!

524
00:19:37,831 --> 00:19:39,971
[cranky grunt]

525
00:19:40,006 --> 00:19:41,525
These lights, Snowball...

526
00:19:41,559 --> 00:19:43,699
Yeah, it's not like
I had enough to do, no, no.

527
00:19:43,734 --> 00:19:44,942
I...

528
00:19:44,976 --> 00:19:45,908
I needed to fix the lights,

529
00:19:45,943 --> 00:19:47,807
so I really appreciate it.

530
00:19:47,841 --> 00:19:48,946
Good dog.

531
00:19:48,980 --> 00:19:50,879
[not pleased] Good dog.

532
00:19:50,913 --> 00:19:51,983
[grumbling angrily]

533
00:19:52,018 --> 00:19:53,916
[Nick]:
I tell you, every year

534
00:19:53,951 --> 00:19:57,782
it seems the kids wish
for more electronic gadgets.

535
00:19:57,817 --> 00:19:58,783
Some toys.

536
00:19:58,818 --> 00:20:00,544
Listen to this...

537
00:20:00,578 --> 00:20:02,925
Dear Santa, I think I've been
a very good boy,

538
00:20:02,960 --> 00:20:07,999
so I'm wishing
for an RX-48 Gaming System,

539
00:20:08,034 --> 00:20:09,725
a cellphone,
and a tablet.

540
00:20:09,760 --> 00:20:10,726
Love, David.

541
00:20:10,761 --> 00:20:12,038
Oh, wow.

542
00:20:12,072 --> 00:20:13,764
Well, David's got
a tall order.

543
00:20:13,798 --> 00:20:14,834
Is he on the nice list?

544
00:20:14,868 --> 00:20:16,284
Why, yes, he is.

545
00:20:16,318 --> 00:20:18,355
-Good morning.
-Hi.

546
00:20:18,389 --> 00:20:20,840
Oh, well,
good morning, sleepyhead.

547
00:20:20,874 --> 00:20:21,910
[Nick chuckles]

548
00:20:21,944 --> 00:20:23,877
Yeah. Yeah, so sorry.

549
00:20:23,912 --> 00:20:26,708
I... I slept late.

550
00:20:26,742 --> 00:20:27,950
Oh, it must be that
fresh arctic air.

551
00:20:27,985 --> 00:20:28,848
Pancakes?

552
00:20:28,882 --> 00:20:30,056
Uh, yes, please.

553
00:20:30,090 --> 00:20:30,884
[Man]: Don't mind if I do.

554
00:20:30,919 --> 00:20:33,922
Oh, Frost, my boy!

555
00:20:33,956 --> 00:20:35,372
Hello.

556
00:20:35,406 --> 00:20:36,821
Nick.

557
00:20:36,856 --> 00:20:37,753
Hey-hey-hey!

558
00:20:37,788 --> 00:20:38,892
Well, ho-ho-ho!

559
00:20:38,927 --> 00:20:40,066
[guys chuckling]

560
00:20:40,100 --> 00:20:41,792
[Mom]: Nice
to see you, Jack.

561
00:20:41,826 --> 00:20:45,036
Jessica, you are looking
as rosy as ever.

562
00:20:45,071 --> 00:20:46,866
Very charming.

563
00:20:46,900 --> 00:20:47,867
Here you go.

564
00:20:47,901 --> 00:20:48,799
Thank you.

565
00:20:48,833 --> 00:20:49,869
Hello, Jack.

566
00:20:49,903 --> 00:20:50,801
"Hello, Jack"?

567
00:20:50,835 --> 00:20:52,043
That's it?

568
00:20:52,078 --> 00:20:53,459
I haven't seen you
in forever, it seems,

569
00:20:53,493 --> 00:20:54,494
and that's all I get?

570
00:20:56,116 --> 00:20:59,016
Uh, Jack, this is
my boyfriend, Connor.

571
00:20:59,050 --> 00:21:00,397
Connor, Jack.

572
00:21:00,431 --> 00:21:02,330
Boyfriend.

573
00:21:02,364 --> 00:21:03,054
Hey. Connor.
Nice to meet you.

574
00:21:03,089 --> 00:21:04,470
-Yeah.
-Wow, chilly hands.

575
00:21:04,504 --> 00:21:06,092
You should get some gloves.

576
00:21:06,126 --> 00:21:07,473
Ah, well,
they don't call me Frost

577
00:21:07,507 --> 00:21:09,095
for nothing...

578
00:21:09,129 --> 00:21:09,958
[laughing]
Oh, do you hear that?

579
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:11,546
Which reminds me,

580
00:21:11,580 --> 00:21:13,030
I brought you
a welcome home present.

581
00:21:13,064 --> 00:21:14,480
Oh...

582
00:21:14,514 --> 00:21:15,584
-Oh.
-Oh!

583
00:21:15,619 --> 00:21:16,585
One of
your ice sculptures!

584
00:21:16,620 --> 00:21:18,553
Yeah,
it's a replica

585
00:21:18,587 --> 00:21:19,968
of the life-size one
I made for Holly

586
00:21:20,002 --> 00:21:21,038
on her 16th birthday.

587
00:21:21,072 --> 00:21:22,764
Remember, Holly?

588
00:21:22,798 --> 00:21:24,421
Beautiful.

589
00:21:24,455 --> 00:21:25,318
That was the day
you agreed to be my girl

590
00:21:25,353 --> 00:21:27,527
forever and ever.

591
00:21:27,562 --> 00:21:29,978
[awkward chuckle] Ah,
that was a long time ago.

592
00:21:30,012 --> 00:21:31,428
It wasn't that long.

593
00:21:31,462 --> 00:21:32,981
Why don't I just go
put this on ice?

594
00:21:33,015 --> 00:21:34,500
Yes.

595
00:21:34,534 --> 00:21:37,088
So is that your thing,
like, ice sculpting?

596
00:21:37,123 --> 00:21:39,056
Ah, well, not just ice.

597
00:21:39,090 --> 00:21:40,091
Snow too.

598
00:21:40,126 --> 00:21:41,334
-Oh, really?
-Yeah, yeah.

599
00:21:41,369 --> 00:21:42,922
-Wow.
-Think fast.

600
00:21:42,956 --> 00:21:44,095
-Oh!
-Oh!

601
00:21:44,130 --> 00:21:45,062
-Oh, come...
-Jack!

602
00:21:45,096 --> 00:21:46,063
Uh, uh...

603
00:21:46,097 --> 00:21:48,376
Really?

604
00:21:48,410 --> 00:21:49,515
Oh, come on,
it's all in good fun,

605
00:21:49,549 --> 00:21:50,619
right, Connor?

606
00:21:50,654 --> 00:21:52,656
Yeah, that came
out of nowhere.

607
00:21:52,690 --> 00:21:54,451
[Jack, laughing]: Well, I can't
imagine Holly dating someone

608
00:21:54,485 --> 00:21:55,935
that hasn't got
a sense of humor.

609
00:21:55,969 --> 00:21:57,108
Yeah, you're right.

610
00:21:57,143 --> 00:21:58,455
Look at her father.

611
00:21:58,489 --> 00:22:00,526
It doesn't get
jollier than this guy.

612
00:22:00,560 --> 00:22:01,837
[laughs] I guess not.

613
00:22:01,872 --> 00:22:03,529
Jack...

614
00:22:03,563 --> 00:22:04,495
Oh, it's good to see you.

615
00:22:04,530 --> 00:22:05,496
Let me help you out.

616
00:22:05,531 --> 00:22:06,704
Okay, see
you guys later.

617
00:22:06,739 --> 00:22:08,775
[Nick, laughing]:
Oh, he slays me.

618
00:22:10,639 --> 00:22:13,366
Holly Claus,
I'm surprised at you...

619
00:22:13,401 --> 00:22:14,436
Dating someone

620
00:22:14,471 --> 00:22:16,024
who can't even
catch a snowball.

621
00:22:16,058 --> 00:22:17,370
Oh, we live down south.

622
00:22:17,405 --> 00:22:19,441
He hasn't had
a lot of practice.

623
00:22:19,476 --> 00:22:20,718
So, what,

624
00:22:20,753 --> 00:22:22,375
are you actually serious
about this guy?

625
00:22:22,410 --> 00:22:24,412
Yes. Yes, I am.

626
00:22:25,999 --> 00:22:27,587
I think he's going to propose.

627
00:22:29,071 --> 00:22:30,556
You're kidding, right?

628
00:22:30,590 --> 00:22:31,591
You actually
think Conrad...

629
00:22:31,626 --> 00:22:32,972
Connor.

630
00:22:33,006 --> 00:22:35,733
...Connor will fit in
to your family?

631
00:22:35,768 --> 00:22:37,908
Because, you know, with me,
I never had that problem.

632
00:22:37,942 --> 00:22:39,599
I mean, in fact,

633
00:22:39,634 --> 00:22:41,498
it's what made us
a great match...

634
00:22:41,532 --> 00:22:44,086
It's what makes us
a great match.

635
00:22:46,123 --> 00:22:48,643
It's not going to happen, Jack.

636
00:22:49,989 --> 00:22:52,647
I'm with Connor now.

637
00:22:53,613 --> 00:22:54,476
Okay.

638
00:22:54,511 --> 00:22:56,444
We'll see.

639
00:22:56,478 --> 00:22:58,480
But I'll be by
again soon, Holly.

640
00:22:58,515 --> 00:23:00,827
It's good to see you.

641
00:23:03,934 --> 00:23:05,142
Everything okay?

642
00:23:05,176 --> 00:23:06,212
Yeah, everything's fine.

643
00:23:06,246 --> 00:23:07,558
Yeah.

644
00:23:07,593 --> 00:23:09,560
So that was
the ex-boyfriend, huh?

645
00:23:09,595 --> 00:23:11,217
Yes. That was
a long time ago.

646
00:23:11,251 --> 00:23:12,425
Yeah, well...

647
00:23:13,771 --> 00:23:15,670
So he lives here?
At the North Pole?

648
00:23:15,704 --> 00:23:17,223
Yeah, he's our neighbor.

649
00:23:17,257 --> 00:23:18,500
He's probably
the closest one...

650
00:23:18,535 --> 00:23:21,745
In... In... Not that
he's the closest,

651
00:23:21,779 --> 00:23:23,505
but in proximity.

652
00:23:23,540 --> 00:23:24,644
Yeah.

653
00:23:24,679 --> 00:23:25,507
Come on,
let's get some pancakes

654
00:23:25,542 --> 00:23:26,474
before they get cold.

655
00:23:26,508 --> 00:23:28,441
Actually, you know what?

656
00:23:28,476 --> 00:23:31,755
There's a little something
that I need to work on.

657
00:23:31,789 --> 00:23:33,239
Okay.

658
00:23:33,273 --> 00:23:34,171
All right.

659
00:23:34,205 --> 00:23:35,068
All right.

660
00:23:35,103 --> 00:23:36,691
[footsteps recede]

661
00:23:38,037 --> 00:23:39,970
[sighs]

662
00:23:40,004 --> 00:23:41,523
Dear sir...

663
00:23:42,628 --> 00:23:43,629
No.

664
00:23:45,700 --> 00:23:47,633
Dear Mr. Claus...

665
00:23:52,948 --> 00:23:53,915
Mom...

666
00:23:53,949 --> 00:23:55,710
Hmm?

667
00:23:55,744 --> 00:23:56,883
Why did you have to
tell Jack I was home?

668
00:23:56,918 --> 00:23:57,884
Well, I didn't, honey.

669
00:23:57,919 --> 00:23:59,230
The little birds told him.

670
00:23:59,265 --> 00:24:01,543
You know how
those doves do chatter.

671
00:24:03,165 --> 00:24:04,201
Well, just
so you know,

672
00:24:04,235 --> 00:24:05,478
it's over
with me and Jack.

673
00:24:05,513 --> 00:24:07,653
It was the moment
that I left.

674
00:24:07,687 --> 00:24:09,206
Well, that
doesn't surprise me.

675
00:24:09,240 --> 00:24:11,277
That boy would have melted
if he'd left the Pole.

676
00:24:11,311 --> 00:24:15,661
Well, I mean,
that's not why it ended.

677
00:24:16,558 --> 00:24:18,629
It didn't work.

678
00:24:19,561 --> 00:24:21,494
You understand, right?

679
00:24:21,529 --> 00:24:22,564
Yeah, of course I do.

680
00:24:23,876 --> 00:24:27,776
Honey, you have not yet
told Connor

681
00:24:27,811 --> 00:24:28,984
who you really are.

682
00:24:29,019 --> 00:24:31,021
I will.

683
00:24:31,055 --> 00:24:32,643
And when I do,

684
00:24:32,678 --> 00:24:35,301
I think he is going
to fit in perfectly.

685
00:24:35,335 --> 00:24:36,889
Yeah.

686
00:24:36,923 --> 00:24:38,753
Right, Donner?

687
00:24:40,582 --> 00:24:42,895
See, Donner agrees.

688
00:24:42,929 --> 00:24:44,897
Well, there's a truth.

689
00:24:44,931 --> 00:24:46,208
That's settled.

690
00:24:55,079 --> 00:24:56,598
Dear Mr. Claus.

691
00:24:58,600 --> 00:25:00,878
Mr. Claus,
uh, may I have a moment?

692
00:25:00,913 --> 00:25:02,570
Just a moment of your time?
A word?

693
00:25:02,604 --> 00:25:03,743
Your daughter, she's...

694
00:25:03,778 --> 00:25:05,020
She's a wonderful person.

695
00:25:05,055 --> 00:25:07,057
You know what,
she has made me so happy.

696
00:25:07,091 --> 00:25:08,610
What I'd like to do

697
00:25:08,645 --> 00:25:11,302
is ask
for her hand in marriage.

698
00:25:11,337 --> 00:25:12,303
[footsteps approach]

699
00:25:12,338 --> 00:25:13,201
Hey, hey, Connor!

700
00:25:13,235 --> 00:25:14,305
Hey, Snowball.

701
00:25:14,340 --> 00:25:16,135
Nick. Mr. Claus. Hey.

702
00:25:16,169 --> 00:25:17,654
Do you have a minute?

703
00:25:17,688 --> 00:25:20,864
I will, after I get back
from my fitting.

704
00:25:20,898 --> 00:25:23,211
Seems I've lost a wee pound
or two this year.

705
00:25:23,245 --> 00:25:24,557
I'll be back.

706
00:25:24,592 --> 00:25:26,663
Milk and cookies
in the kitchen.

707
00:25:26,697 --> 00:25:29,320
Something special...
in the corner.

708
00:25:29,355 --> 00:25:31,668
[chuckles]

709
00:25:36,914 --> 00:25:38,675
Oh.

710
00:25:38,709 --> 00:25:40,677
Something special in the corner.

711
00:25:41,885 --> 00:25:42,851
[chuckles]

712
00:25:42,886 --> 00:25:44,612
Now, ladies,

713
00:25:44,646 --> 00:25:46,786
you have got to stop gossiping
to Jack

714
00:25:46,821 --> 00:25:48,029
about me and Connor.

715
00:25:48,063 --> 00:25:49,030
You got it?

716
00:25:49,064 --> 00:25:50,721
I know we're friends,

717
00:25:50,756 --> 00:25:53,724
but you can't betray my trust
here.

718
00:25:53,759 --> 00:25:55,864
Jack doesn't get
to know everything anymore.

719
00:25:55,899 --> 00:25:57,659
There you go.

720
00:25:58,798 --> 00:26:02,768
Those birds can't keep
their dang beaks shut.

721
00:26:02,802 --> 00:26:04,321
Yeah, I'm talking about you.

722
00:26:07,151 --> 00:26:09,222
So how are you holding up?

723
00:26:09,257 --> 00:26:11,708
Oh, you know...

724
00:26:11,742 --> 00:26:14,020
It's kind of strange
to be here,

725
00:26:14,055 --> 00:26:16,057
especially with Connor.

726
00:26:16,091 --> 00:26:18,853
Have you talked to him
about...

727
00:26:18,887 --> 00:26:20,751
No, not yet,
but I will.

728
00:26:20,786 --> 00:26:24,962
I'm just kind of
scared that he...

729
00:26:24,997 --> 00:26:26,964
It might freak him out,
and then...

730
00:26:26,999 --> 00:26:32,798
Maybe just talk to him,
and then you'll know.

731
00:26:36,077 --> 00:26:37,078
You're right, Mario,

732
00:26:37,112 --> 00:26:39,218
I just need to talk to him.

733
00:26:39,252 --> 00:26:40,909
Going to tell him right now.

734
00:26:42,462 --> 00:26:44,672
Attagirl!

735
00:26:49,331 --> 00:26:50,747
[cuckoo clock chimes]

736
00:26:57,995 --> 00:26:59,894
Huh...

737
00:26:59,928 --> 00:27:02,344
Don't mind if I do.

738
00:27:09,386 --> 00:27:12,838
Ah, perhaps I'll try
a thimble of the sherry.

739
00:27:15,426 --> 00:27:16,427
[beeping]

740
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:18,671
What?

741
00:27:18,706 --> 00:27:19,879
[slam!]

742
00:27:23,020 --> 00:27:24,815
Connor?

743
00:27:28,232 --> 00:27:30,718
Aah! Aah!

744
00:27:30,752 --> 00:27:32,685
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!

745
00:27:32,720 --> 00:27:34,894
Wha... Whoa! Oh!

746
00:27:42,039 --> 00:27:43,731
[gasps]

747
00:27:43,765 --> 00:27:45,767
-[alarm blares]
-Intruder!

748
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:46,768
[all shrieking]

749
00:27:48,287 --> 00:27:50,496
What? Wha... Whoa!

750
00:27:50,530 --> 00:27:52,153
[alarm blaring]

751
00:27:52,187 --> 00:27:53,741
Oh, no!

752
00:27:53,775 --> 00:27:55,121
Oh!

753
00:27:55,156 --> 00:27:56,744
[alarm blaring]

754
00:27:58,815 --> 00:28:01,058
Huckleberries and mistletoe!

755
00:28:01,093 --> 00:28:01,921
Don't move.

756
00:28:03,958 --> 00:28:06,167
[elves shouting]

757
00:28:06,201 --> 00:28:08,203
There's got to be some kind
of misunderstanding here, okay?

758
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:09,929
What's going on
here?

759
00:28:09,964 --> 00:28:11,137
Intruder, sir.

760
00:28:11,172 --> 00:28:12,276
No, I'm not an intruder.

761
00:28:12,311 --> 00:28:13,933
Oh!

762
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:15,176
Guys, he's not an intruder.

763
00:28:15,210 --> 00:28:16,177
He's my boyfriend.

764
00:28:16,211 --> 00:28:17,212
Yeah.

765
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:18,110
Come on,
you merry munchkins,

766
00:28:18,144 --> 00:28:19,836
untie him.

767
00:28:19,870 --> 00:28:20,837
Yeah. Thank you.

768
00:28:20,871 --> 00:28:21,872
Thank you.

769
00:28:21,907 --> 00:28:22,873
[Mario]: Yeah...

770
00:28:22,908 --> 00:28:25,807
You guys are animals.

771
00:28:25,842 --> 00:28:26,843
Thank you.

772
00:28:28,051 --> 00:28:28,983
Yeah. All right.

773
00:28:32,227 --> 00:28:34,747
Are you okay?

774
00:28:35,852 --> 00:28:37,129
I... I mean, I'm fine.

775
00:28:37,163 --> 00:28:38,544
I'm fine.

776
00:28:38,578 --> 00:28:39,959
What is this place?

777
00:28:39,994 --> 00:28:43,031
Uh, it's a factory.

778
00:28:43,066 --> 00:28:44,412
Oh!

779
00:28:44,446 --> 00:28:46,138
So, like, when
you were talking about

780
00:28:46,172 --> 00:28:47,518
how your parents
are busy all the time,

781
00:28:47,553 --> 00:28:48,899
it's 'cause they run
a factory.

782
00:28:48,934 --> 00:28:50,176
Exactly.

783
00:28:50,211 --> 00:28:51,177
What do they make here?

784
00:28:51,212 --> 00:28:52,834
Toys.

785
00:28:52,869 --> 00:28:54,422
We make toys.

786
00:28:54,456 --> 00:28:56,079
[Nick]: Jumpin'
juniper berries!

787
00:28:56,113 --> 00:28:57,943
What's all the ruckus?

788
00:28:57,977 --> 00:29:00,221
At least let me get
the last of the pins out, sir.

789
00:29:00,255 --> 00:29:01,809
Oh...

790
00:29:01,843 --> 00:29:04,087
You have to tell him,
sweetheart,

791
00:29:04,121 --> 00:29:06,917
before his head
explodes.

792
00:29:11,301 --> 00:29:12,992
[sighs]

793
00:29:13,027 --> 00:29:15,063
Connor... Oh.

794
00:29:15,098 --> 00:29:16,271
Um, there's something

795
00:29:16,306 --> 00:29:18,826
that I've been meaning
to tell you.

796
00:29:18,860 --> 00:29:19,965
My parents,

797
00:29:19,999 --> 00:29:24,452
they have
a very special job.

798
00:29:30,009 --> 00:29:30,976
Oh...

799
00:29:31,010 --> 00:29:32,011
Oh... [stammers]

800
00:29:33,219 --> 00:29:35,187
Oh, my gosh...

801
00:29:35,221 --> 00:29:37,120
Here? North Pole.

802
00:29:37,154 --> 00:29:39,122
The toys...

803
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,330
Uh-huh.

804
00:29:40,364 --> 00:29:41,952
Your guys' name?

805
00:29:41,987 --> 00:29:43,471
Uh-huh, yeah.

806
00:29:43,505 --> 00:29:45,853
Um, I'm Holly Claus,

807
00:29:45,887 --> 00:29:49,442
and I am Santa Claus'
daughter.

808
00:29:49,477 --> 00:29:53,205
Oh! Daughter.

809
00:29:53,239 --> 00:29:54,171
Father.

810
00:29:54,206 --> 00:29:55,138
Mm.

811
00:29:55,172 --> 00:29:56,070
Mother.

812
00:29:56,967 --> 00:29:59,349
Hah! Oh, boy.

813
00:29:59,383 --> 00:30:01,558
I'm... I'm so sorry,
Connor.

814
00:30:01,592 --> 00:30:02,870
I meant to tell you
before we left,

815
00:30:02,904 --> 00:30:04,043
and I got nervous,

816
00:30:04,078 --> 00:30:06,149
and then I was on my way
to tell you now,

817
00:30:06,183 --> 00:30:08,047
and it's, um...

818
00:30:08,082 --> 00:30:10,463
Well, now it's too late, so...

819
00:30:10,498 --> 00:30:12,051
[takes deep breaths]

820
00:30:12,086 --> 00:30:14,053
Connor, are you okay?

821
00:30:14,088 --> 00:30:15,054
I...

822
00:30:15,089 --> 00:30:16,021
I need that sherry.

823
00:30:41,115 --> 00:30:44,118
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

824
00:30:45,429 --> 00:30:48,087
These reindeer...

825
00:30:48,122 --> 00:30:50,193
are "the" reindeer.

826
00:30:52,126 --> 00:30:53,921
Mm-hmm.

827
00:30:53,955 --> 00:30:54,922
Yeah.

828
00:30:54,956 --> 00:30:57,269
Oh.

829
00:30:57,303 --> 00:30:59,202
Donner in there.

830
00:30:59,236 --> 00:31:00,686
Vixen.

831
00:31:00,720 --> 00:31:03,896
Blitzen, Prancer, Dasher.

832
00:31:03,931 --> 00:31:06,278
Dancer, Comet, and Cupid
are out to pasture.

833
00:31:06,312 --> 00:31:07,520
Rudolph,

834
00:31:07,555 --> 00:31:09,281
he takes off right
after Christmas,

835
00:31:09,315 --> 00:31:11,248
and he doesn't come back again
till the next year,

836
00:31:11,283 --> 00:31:12,422
like, the night of.

837
00:31:12,456 --> 00:31:15,183
It makes my mom
so crazy with worry.

838
00:31:17,392 --> 00:31:19,498
Okay, so let me
get this straight.

839
00:31:19,532 --> 00:31:21,327
If you and I get married,

840
00:31:21,362 --> 00:31:22,604
my in-laws

841
00:31:22,639 --> 00:31:26,436
will be "the"
Mr. and Mrs. Santa Claus?

842
00:31:26,470 --> 00:31:28,196
Yes.

843
00:31:28,231 --> 00:31:31,475
But you can call them
Nick and Jessica, of course.

844
00:31:34,409 --> 00:31:36,377
Connor, if you're not
okay with this,

845
00:31:36,411 --> 00:31:38,206
I totally understand.

846
00:31:38,241 --> 00:31:40,174
Okay?

847
00:31:42,693 --> 00:31:43,660
I'm better than okay.

848
00:31:45,179 --> 00:31:46,180
I'm so good!

849
00:31:46,214 --> 00:31:48,044
[both laugh]

850
00:31:48,078 --> 00:31:50,425
I mean, you...
you and your family

851
00:31:50,460 --> 00:31:51,357
are incredible.

852
00:31:51,392 --> 00:31:52,496
Oh, I mean...

853
00:31:52,531 --> 00:31:53,635
We're just, you know,

854
00:31:53,670 --> 00:31:54,602
we've got issues
like every family.

855
00:31:54,636 --> 00:31:56,224
No, this is exciting.

856
00:31:56,259 --> 00:31:57,570
Okay, what are the
chances? Seriously.

857
00:31:57,605 --> 00:31:59,503
Me, my absolute favorite
time of the year

858
00:31:59,538 --> 00:32:00,504
is Christmas.

859
00:32:00,539 --> 00:32:02,058
Now this. Huh?

860
00:32:02,092 --> 00:32:04,198
Fate? No, destiny.

861
00:32:04,232 --> 00:32:07,408
Speaking of destiny,
I actually...

862
00:32:07,442 --> 00:32:10,618
I'm going to marry you,
Holly Klaus. Claus.

863
00:32:10,652 --> 00:32:11,619
Santa Claus' daughter!

864
00:32:11,653 --> 00:32:12,585
[both giggle]

865
00:32:12,620 --> 00:32:14,277
Santa Claus' daughter!

866
00:32:14,311 --> 00:32:16,106
I'm going to marry
Santa Claus' daughter!

867
00:32:16,141 --> 00:32:18,143
I'm going to ask Santa
to marry his daughter.

868
00:32:18,177 --> 00:32:19,489
I...

869
00:32:19,523 --> 00:32:20,386
I've got to ask Santa
to marry his daughter!

870
00:32:20,421 --> 00:32:21,491
What?!

871
00:32:21,525 --> 00:32:22,595
That's insane!

872
00:32:22,630 --> 00:32:23,700
That's like
asking the president

873
00:32:23,734 --> 00:32:24,701
or, like, the Easter Bunny.

874
00:32:24,735 --> 00:32:25,564
Is the Easter Bunny here?

875
00:32:25,598 --> 00:32:27,428
No. No.

876
00:32:27,462 --> 00:32:28,498
Okay, good.

877
00:32:28,532 --> 00:32:30,672
I need to focus.

878
00:32:30,707 --> 00:32:32,157
What am I going to say?

879
00:32:32,191 --> 00:32:33,503
What do you mean,
what are you going to say?

880
00:32:33,537 --> 00:32:36,023
Well, I mean, I've got
to convince Santa

881
00:32:36,057 --> 00:32:37,610
that I'm worthy
to marry his daughter,

882
00:32:37,645 --> 00:32:39,233
or else why would Santa
let me marry his daughter?

883
00:32:39,267 --> 00:32:40,475
Why wouldn't he?

884
00:32:40,510 --> 00:32:43,444
He will because I love you.

885
00:32:47,206 --> 00:32:48,345
I love you.

886
00:32:51,521 --> 00:32:53,730
Okay. Okay.

887
00:32:53,764 --> 00:32:54,731
Let's do this.

888
00:32:54,765 --> 00:32:55,732
Hand?

889
00:32:55,766 --> 00:32:56,733
Let's go.

890
00:32:56,767 --> 00:32:57,699
[giggles]

891
00:33:01,565 --> 00:33:03,533
[♪♪♪]

892
00:33:08,710 --> 00:33:09,780
[softly] Uh, Nick?

893
00:33:09,815 --> 00:33:12,783
-Oh. Hello.
-Sorry.

894
00:33:12,818 --> 00:33:16,270
Uh, yeah. Uh, Santa Claus.

895
00:33:16,304 --> 00:33:17,754
Mr. Claus.

896
00:33:17,788 --> 00:33:18,755
Yes.

897
00:33:18,789 --> 00:33:20,274
May I have a word?

898
00:33:20,308 --> 00:33:21,344
Oh, of course.

899
00:33:21,378 --> 00:33:22,690
Come, come, come.

900
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,657
Yeah. Thank you.

901
00:33:24,692 --> 00:33:25,589
Oh, my gosh.

902
00:33:25,624 --> 00:33:26,694
Is that the book?

903
00:33:26,728 --> 00:33:28,454
Oh, it sure is.

904
00:33:28,489 --> 00:33:29,731
Have a look.

905
00:33:29,766 --> 00:33:33,666
Don't worry, you're
on the "nice" list.

906
00:33:35,737 --> 00:33:38,637
[Connor]: Wow.

907
00:33:38,671 --> 00:33:40,328
What's going on?

908
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:43,124
[whispering] Shh.
He's going to ask Dad.

909
00:33:44,505 --> 00:33:45,437
[laughs] Donny Bartlet?

910
00:33:45,471 --> 00:33:46,783
Wow.

911
00:33:46,817 --> 00:33:48,164
He comes to our focus groups
all the time.

912
00:33:48,198 --> 00:33:50,338
He's got a bit
of a mouth on him.

913
00:33:50,373 --> 00:33:52,099
You sure he should be
on the nice list?

914
00:33:52,133 --> 00:33:54,687
You learn, in my business,

915
00:33:54,722 --> 00:33:56,517
everyone gets another chance.

916
00:33:57,759 --> 00:33:59,037
Oh.

917
00:34:01,384 --> 00:34:03,351
I wonder if Stuart Cuthbert
is on there.

918
00:34:03,386 --> 00:34:04,697
[Nick]: Uh, yeah...

919
00:34:08,115 --> 00:34:09,599
Well, it's taking forever.

920
00:34:09,633 --> 00:34:10,772
Look, Connor.

921
00:34:10,807 --> 00:34:12,809
You wanted to speak
with me?

922
00:34:12,843 --> 00:34:14,776
Yes. Yes, of course.

923
00:34:14,811 --> 00:34:15,743
Okay. Here it is.

924
00:34:15,777 --> 00:34:16,778
Okay.

925
00:34:17,917 --> 00:34:20,368
Yeah, I, uh...

926
00:34:27,479 --> 00:34:28,273
Mr. Claus...

927
00:34:29,757 --> 00:34:31,448
I want you to know

928
00:34:31,483 --> 00:34:33,450
that I love your daughter
very much.

929
00:34:34,589 --> 00:34:36,695
She inspires me.

930
00:34:36,729 --> 00:34:39,629
You know, she motivates me.

931
00:34:39,663 --> 00:34:41,562
I just can't imagine my world
without her.

932
00:34:44,910 --> 00:34:49,432
So I wanted to know...

933
00:34:49,466 --> 00:34:51,365
would you allow me
to marry your daughter?

934
00:35:01,513 --> 00:35:02,652
Connor...

935
00:35:04,930 --> 00:35:07,139
Welcome to the family.

936
00:35:07,174 --> 00:35:07,864
[chuckles]

937
00:35:07,898 --> 00:35:09,866
[squeals]

938
00:35:09,900 --> 00:35:10,729
[Nick]: Oh, my boy...

939
00:35:12,179 --> 00:35:14,802
Holly, Holly, Holly...

940
00:35:14,836 --> 00:35:17,736
Yes, yes, yes.

941
00:35:17,770 --> 00:35:19,531
[Nick, chuckling]:
Oh, Mother...

942
00:35:20,739 --> 00:35:22,741
[Holly]: Oh...

943
00:35:24,260 --> 00:35:25,675
Holly Claus...

944
00:35:25,709 --> 00:35:27,573
Will you marry me?

945
00:35:27,608 --> 00:35:28,333
Yes!

946
00:35:28,367 --> 00:35:30,162
Yes, yes, yes!

947
00:35:36,272 --> 00:35:37,238
Oh!

948
00:35:37,273 --> 00:35:39,896
[chuckling]
Oh, you two!

949
00:35:39,930 --> 00:35:42,830
[♪♪♪]

950
00:35:45,212 --> 00:35:47,352
[doves coo]

951
00:35:49,388 --> 00:35:51,563
[humming]

952
00:35:59,778 --> 00:36:01,573
So it's official.

953
00:36:01,607 --> 00:36:04,783
It is.

954
00:36:04,817 --> 00:36:06,681
And you've told him, right?

955
00:36:06,716 --> 00:36:08,442
I will.

956
00:36:08,476 --> 00:36:10,444
Honey...

957
00:36:10,478 --> 00:36:13,274
Look, you cannot forget
the task at hand.

958
00:36:13,309 --> 00:36:16,346
It has been our job
as the women in this family

959
00:36:16,381 --> 00:36:17,796
to prepare the men
for their job

960
00:36:17,830 --> 00:36:19,246
as the next Santa.

961
00:36:19,280 --> 00:36:21,662
I know.

962
00:36:21,696 --> 00:36:22,594
I do.

963
00:36:22,628 --> 00:36:24,872
I will.

964
00:36:24,906 --> 00:36:26,460
But I would just like
to give him

965
00:36:26,494 --> 00:36:28,220
a couple of extra days

966
00:36:28,255 --> 00:36:29,532
to get used to the idea
of all of this first.

967
00:36:30,878 --> 00:36:32,535
Fine.

968
00:36:32,569 --> 00:36:33,846
But it doesn't mean
we can't start working,

969
00:36:33,881 --> 00:36:35,883
though.

970
00:36:35,917 --> 00:36:36,953
Time is ticking.

971
00:36:36,987 --> 00:36:37,850
Absolutely.

972
00:36:37,885 --> 00:36:39,404
Tick-tock.

973
00:36:40,957 --> 00:36:42,821
So, what are we doing?

974
00:36:42,855 --> 00:36:44,892
I think we should see
if he could hold his cookies.

975
00:36:44,926 --> 00:36:47,377
I mean, after all,
on Christmas Eve,

976
00:36:47,412 --> 00:36:49,379
he's going to be eating
about five billion of them.

977
00:36:49,414 --> 00:36:52,037
And a Santa on Christmas Eve
with an upset tummy...

978
00:36:52,071 --> 00:36:53,901
ooh, is a cranky Santa.

979
00:36:56,006 --> 00:36:58,250
So over here
is our test area.

980
00:36:58,285 --> 00:37:01,322
It's kind of our, uh,
quality control.

981
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:03,566
And here's
our newest creations.

982
00:37:03,600 --> 00:37:07,294
Every year we like to create
about a dozen new toys.

983
00:37:07,328 --> 00:37:09,261
I mean,
you know how it is...

984
00:37:09,296 --> 00:37:11,953
Kids,
they get tired of their toys,

985
00:37:11,988 --> 00:37:14,991
so we like
to change it up.

986
00:37:19,340 --> 00:37:20,479
What is this?

987
00:37:20,514 --> 00:37:25,415
Oh, oh, actually,
that's not a toy.

988
00:37:25,450 --> 00:37:26,968
It's a contraption
I'm working on

989
00:37:27,003 --> 00:37:29,074
that warps time and space

990
00:37:29,108 --> 00:37:30,040
so when the elves
have to go back

991
00:37:30,075 --> 00:37:31,490
and do damage control,

992
00:37:31,525 --> 00:37:35,563
they can leave the North Pole
at warp speed.

993
00:37:35,598 --> 00:37:37,531
So how does it work?

994
00:37:37,565 --> 00:37:40,844
Oh. Well, you just
write your address here,

995
00:37:40,879 --> 00:37:42,536
and then... but...
[stammers]

996
00:37:42,570 --> 00:37:44,952
Uh, actually, it really
hasn't been tested...

997
00:37:44,986 --> 00:37:46,436
No, don't break it!

998
00:37:46,471 --> 00:37:47,437
[zapping]

999
00:37:49,025 --> 00:37:50,337
[shrieks]

1000
00:37:51,545 --> 00:37:52,960
-Connor?
-Yeah?

1001
00:37:52,994 --> 00:37:54,548
Mom and I
were wondering

1002
00:37:54,582 --> 00:37:55,514
if you could assist us
in the kitchen

1003
00:37:55,549 --> 00:37:56,998
with something.

1004
00:37:57,033 --> 00:37:58,586
That's a great
idea.

1005
00:37:58,621 --> 00:38:00,485
Yeah. Yeah, absolutely.

1006
00:38:00,519 --> 00:38:01,865
Yeah.

1007
00:38:01,900 --> 00:38:02,866
Mario, hey.

1008
00:38:02,901 --> 00:38:04,316
Thanks for the tour, bud.

1009
00:38:04,351 --> 00:38:09,425
And, uh, sorry
about the... the thing.

1010
00:38:09,459 --> 00:38:11,944
Ah, no biggie.

1011
00:38:11,979 --> 00:38:12,911
[chuckles]
I'll fix it.

1012
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:13,843
Nice.

1013
00:38:13,877 --> 00:38:16,086
Yeah.

1014
00:38:20,401 --> 00:38:23,024
Okay, Connor.
Here you go.

1015
00:38:25,648 --> 00:38:27,097
Those look delicious.

1016
00:38:27,132 --> 00:38:28,513
Well, we hope so,

1017
00:38:28,547 --> 00:38:30,031
'cause, you see,

1018
00:38:30,066 --> 00:38:32,482
Mom is trying out
a bunch of new recipes,

1019
00:38:32,517 --> 00:38:35,071
and she needs your help
testing them for her,

1020
00:38:35,105 --> 00:38:35,934
right, Mom?

1021
00:38:35,968 --> 00:38:37,832
That's right.

1022
00:38:37,867 --> 00:38:40,801
Well, now, there's a job
I'll have no problem with.

1023
00:38:42,009 --> 00:38:44,494
All right,
let's get started.

1024
00:38:48,671 --> 00:38:50,431
Wow.

1025
00:38:52,157 --> 00:38:54,504
[slow munching]

1026
00:39:02,132 --> 00:39:04,480
How are you doing,
sweetie?

1027
00:39:04,514 --> 00:39:06,999
Yeah, yeah....
Um, I think I'm full.

1028
00:39:07,034 --> 00:39:08,000
Oh.

1029
00:39:08,035 --> 00:39:09,070
[door opens, closes]

1030
00:39:09,105 --> 00:39:10,382
[someone whistles]

1031
00:39:10,417 --> 00:39:12,453
Hello?

1032
00:39:12,488 --> 00:39:14,179
A little white dove told me

1033
00:39:14,213 --> 00:39:16,630
Mamma was baking
some of her famous cookies.

1034
00:39:16,664 --> 00:39:18,148
Darn doves.

1035
00:39:18,183 --> 00:39:19,943
You always had
a real hankering

1036
00:39:19,978 --> 00:39:21,704
for my cooking.

1037
00:39:21,738 --> 00:39:23,153
Pff, yeah, only because
they're the best cookies

1038
00:39:23,188 --> 00:39:24,672
this side of the Pole.

1039
00:39:24,707 --> 00:39:25,673
Okay.

1040
00:39:25,708 --> 00:39:27,088
Hey, Connor.

1041
00:39:27,123 --> 00:39:27,951
You're looking
a little green, man.

1042
00:39:27,986 --> 00:39:28,883
Everything okay?

1043
00:39:28,918 --> 00:39:29,746
Yeah.

1044
00:39:29,781 --> 00:39:31,092
Yeah, I'm fine.

1045
00:39:31,127 --> 00:39:32,577
Yeah, I was just
taste-testing

1046
00:39:32,611 --> 00:39:34,406
some of Jessica's
cookies, yeah.

1047
00:39:34,441 --> 00:39:35,718
Unfortunately

1048
00:39:35,752 --> 00:39:37,202
I don't think we'll be
getting through these.

1049
00:39:37,236 --> 00:39:38,583
Oh, no, no,
he'll be fine.

1050
00:39:38,617 --> 00:39:40,412
He just needs
a little bit of a break.

1051
00:39:40,447 --> 00:39:41,586
Right, Connor?

1052
00:39:41,620 --> 00:39:44,105
[quietly]
Do you have any antacids?

1053
00:39:44,140 --> 00:39:45,141
I have a little heartburn.

1054
00:39:45,175 --> 00:39:46,073
Oh...

1055
00:39:46,107 --> 00:39:47,419
Is this all that's left?

1056
00:39:47,454 --> 00:39:49,559
Because... No problem.

1057
00:39:49,594 --> 00:39:51,768
I am Jack Frost,
after all.

1058
00:39:51,803 --> 00:39:52,942
I'll test them for you.

1059
00:39:54,081 --> 00:39:55,047
Jack Frost?

1060
00:39:56,463 --> 00:39:58,706
[rapid chomping]

1061
00:40:18,830 --> 00:40:19,934
Mm...

1062
00:40:19,969 --> 00:40:20,901
What?!

1063
00:40:20,935 --> 00:40:22,420
[Jack lets out a breath]

1064
00:40:24,629 --> 00:40:26,907
That was tasty.

1065
00:40:26,941 --> 00:40:28,253
Okay, Jack.

1066
00:40:28,287 --> 00:40:30,566
These are for you.

1067
00:40:30,600 --> 00:40:32,050
Try not to eat them
all at once.

1068
00:40:32,084 --> 00:40:34,017
I'll do my best,

1069
00:40:34,052 --> 00:40:36,157
but no guarantees.

1070
00:40:36,192 --> 00:40:37,814
[laughs] Thanks, Jess.

1071
00:40:37,849 --> 00:40:39,747
Hey, Holly, can I talk to you
for a minute?

1072
00:40:39,782 --> 00:40:40,645
Yeah.

1073
00:40:40,679 --> 00:40:42,474
Oh, thanks.

1074
00:40:48,204 --> 00:40:49,757
So, what was that
in there?

1075
00:40:49,792 --> 00:40:51,587
What was what?

1076
00:40:51,621 --> 00:40:53,278
I see the ring on your finger.

1077
00:40:53,312 --> 00:40:54,969
You were testing him.

1078
00:40:55,004 --> 00:40:56,764
Oh...

1079
00:40:56,799 --> 00:40:58,663
You don't know
what you're talking about, Jack.

1080
00:40:58,697 --> 00:41:00,630
Does he even know
what he's in for?

1081
00:41:03,081 --> 00:41:05,290
Wow.

1082
00:41:05,324 --> 00:41:07,810
Well, all I have to say
is good luck.

1083
00:41:07,844 --> 00:41:09,018
I mean, by the way
he failed miserably

1084
00:41:09,052 --> 00:41:10,916
with those cookies,

1085
00:41:10,951 --> 00:41:13,781
looks like you've got
your work cut out for you.

1086
00:41:14,679 --> 00:41:16,612
Always nice
to see you, Jack.

1087
00:41:17,613 --> 00:41:18,752
Just remember, Holly...

1088
00:41:18,786 --> 00:41:20,685
Christmas is the
most special day

1089
00:41:20,719 --> 00:41:21,824
of the year.

1090
00:41:21,858 --> 00:41:23,619
You don't want to ruin it

1091
00:41:23,653 --> 00:41:26,725
by giving the job
to someone who can't handle it.

1092
00:41:26,760 --> 00:41:27,761
Right?

1093
00:41:30,280 --> 00:41:31,765
I'm just saying.

1094
00:41:39,980 --> 00:41:41,637
[sighs]

1095
00:41:48,609 --> 00:41:50,266
I brought you
some antacids.

1096
00:41:50,300 --> 00:41:52,302
Oh, thank you.

1097
00:41:55,961 --> 00:41:56,893
Jack still here?

1098
00:41:56,928 --> 00:41:58,757
No. He left.

1099
00:41:58,792 --> 00:41:59,931
Nice.

1100
00:41:59,965 --> 00:42:01,311
He's got quite the appetite.

1101
00:42:01,346 --> 00:42:02,278
I've never seen
anything like that.

1102
00:42:02,312 --> 00:42:04,245
Oh, he was just showing off.

1103
00:42:04,280 --> 00:42:06,696
Yeah?

1104
00:42:06,731 --> 00:42:08,042
For you or your mom?

1105
00:42:08,077 --> 00:42:11,805
Connor, you don't have
to be jealous of him.

1106
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,876
I know. I know.

1107
00:42:13,910 --> 00:42:15,636
It just...

1108
00:42:15,671 --> 00:42:18,190
kind of seems like he fits in,
and...

1109
00:42:18,225 --> 00:42:19,709
I, uh...

1110
00:42:23,092 --> 00:42:24,887
You have nothing
to worry about, okay?

1111
00:42:24,921 --> 00:42:27,372
You're going
to fit in.

1112
00:42:27,406 --> 00:42:29,719
I'll make sure of it.

1113
00:42:32,757 --> 00:42:33,758
Okay.

1114
00:42:36,346 --> 00:42:37,382
Could you please tell your mom

1115
00:42:37,416 --> 00:42:38,797
that I might skip dinner
tonight?

1116
00:42:38,832 --> 00:42:40,592
Sure.

1117
00:42:44,941 --> 00:42:46,736
Thanks again.

1118
00:42:57,195 --> 00:42:59,853
[♪♪♪]

1119
00:43:04,720 --> 00:43:05,721
Only two
marshmallows.

1120
00:43:05,755 --> 00:43:08,240
I need the rest
for the smores.

1121
00:43:08,275 --> 00:43:09,794
Okay.

1122
00:43:09,828 --> 00:43:12,141
So where's
this Connor fellow?

1123
00:43:12,175 --> 00:43:14,005
I think he's down
in the factory.

1124
00:43:14,039 --> 00:43:15,316
He seems very interested
in what the elves are doing.

1125
00:43:15,351 --> 00:43:16,766
Mm.

1126
00:43:16,801 --> 00:43:18,630
Sounds like he might
be better served

1127
00:43:18,665 --> 00:43:19,424
making toys

1128
00:43:19,458 --> 00:43:21,426
than being Santa.

1129
00:43:21,460 --> 00:43:22,427
What?

1130
00:43:22,461 --> 00:43:24,671
Oh, come on,
Jessica.

1131
00:43:24,705 --> 00:43:25,948
Don't tell me you don't
have your doubts.

1132
00:43:25,982 --> 00:43:29,089
I mean, he's from the south,
for goodness sakes.

1133
00:43:29,123 --> 00:43:31,678
It never gets colder
than 30 degrees down there.

1134
00:43:31,712 --> 00:43:33,818
Now, Jack, we have to
give the boy a chance.

1135
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:34,991
And I think Holly

1136
00:43:35,026 --> 00:43:35,958
is going to do
a really good job

1137
00:43:35,992 --> 00:43:37,856
at training him.

1138
00:43:37,891 --> 00:43:40,997
Yeah, but what if he fails?

1139
00:43:42,205 --> 00:43:44,207
[Jack, to Holly]: So I guess
congratulations are in order.

1140
00:43:44,242 --> 00:43:46,865
Yes, thank you.

1141
00:43:46,900 --> 00:43:49,281
Must be lots to do
before the big day, huh?

1142
00:43:49,316 --> 00:43:51,974
Geez...

1143
00:43:52,008 --> 00:43:53,803
Speaking of which...

1144
00:43:53,838 --> 00:43:55,805
Uh, Connor, you ever
slide down a chimney before?

1145
00:43:56,910 --> 00:43:58,670
Excuse me?

1146
00:43:58,705 --> 00:44:00,948
Uh, Hol and I used to do it
when we were kids,

1147
00:44:00,983 --> 00:44:02,294
all the time.

1148
00:44:02,329 --> 00:44:03,675
We had so much fun,

1149
00:44:03,710 --> 00:44:06,678
remember, Hol?

1150
00:44:06,713 --> 00:44:08,024
Yeah, I've slid down
a few banisters in my day.

1151
00:44:08,059 --> 00:44:09,370
Ah.

1152
00:44:09,405 --> 00:44:10,958
Well, then,

1153
00:44:10,993 --> 00:44:11,787
you shouldn't have
any problem at all

1154
00:44:11,821 --> 00:44:12,753
with a chimney.

1155
00:44:13,892 --> 00:44:16,239
What do you say
we give it a go?

1156
00:44:16,274 --> 00:44:17,896
[whistling innocently]

1157
00:44:17,931 --> 00:44:20,416
[wind howling]

1158
00:44:25,766 --> 00:44:27,699
Is it always
this windy?

1159
00:44:27,734 --> 00:44:29,943
Yeah. It's
the North Pole.

1160
00:44:35,293 --> 00:44:36,294
[footsteps approaching]

1161
00:44:36,328 --> 00:44:39,021
Oh-ho, how are you, my girl?

1162
00:44:39,055 --> 00:44:43,128
I thought I'd have myself
a quick read.

1163
00:44:43,163 --> 00:44:45,096
[grunts]

1164
00:44:47,512 --> 00:44:48,962
What?

1165
00:44:50,135 --> 00:44:51,447
Nothing.

1166
00:44:51,481 --> 00:44:54,484
Don't tell me "nothing".

1167
00:44:54,519 --> 00:44:55,865
I know you.

1168
00:44:57,108 --> 00:44:58,281
Tell me.

1169
00:44:58,316 --> 00:44:59,179
What, what?

1170
00:44:59,213 --> 00:45:01,940
It's all good.

1171
00:45:01,975 --> 00:45:03,321
You'll see.

1172
00:45:03,355 --> 00:45:05,150
Oh, good news, though...

1173
00:45:05,185 --> 00:45:08,395
it's really hot
in the chimney.

1174
00:45:08,429 --> 00:45:10,742
Think you can
handle the heat?

1175
00:45:10,777 --> 00:45:13,503
Yeah. I can
handle the heat.

1176
00:45:13,538 --> 00:45:15,229
We'll see about that.

1177
00:45:16,886 --> 00:45:18,923
Here goes nothin'.

1178
00:45:20,476 --> 00:45:22,512

-Ooh!

1180
00:45:23,272 --> 00:45:25,032
Oh, Jack!

1181
00:45:25,067 --> 00:45:26,758
Just doing a little
chimney sliding, Nick.

1182
00:45:26,793 --> 00:45:27,759
Jack...

1183
00:45:27,794 --> 00:45:28,933
[Jack]: Such fun.

1184
00:45:28,967 --> 00:45:29,865
All right, buddy,

1185
00:45:29,899 --> 00:45:31,107
you're up!

1186
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:33,040
Yeah, yeah,
I'll be right down.

1187
00:45:34,248 --> 00:45:35,871
Wow.

1188
00:45:37,907 --> 00:45:40,254
Connor, you don't
have to do this!

1189
00:45:40,289 --> 00:45:42,878
[Connor]: Don't worry,
I got this, babe!

1190
00:45:44,258 --> 00:45:46,295
What are you kids
up to?

1191
00:45:46,329 --> 00:45:47,399
Uh...

1192
00:45:47,434 --> 00:45:48,953

1195
00:46:19,293 --> 00:46:21,330
Yeah. Yeah...

1196
00:46:24,367 --> 00:46:25,265
[Connor]: Whoa! Aah!

1197
00:46:25,299 --> 00:46:26,335
Connor?

1198
00:46:26,369 --> 00:46:27,508
[Connor]: Hello!

1199
00:46:27,543 --> 00:46:28,509
Are you
all right?

1200
00:46:28,544 --> 00:46:29,579
[Connor]: Oh, yeah, yeah.

1201
00:46:29,614 --> 00:46:32,030
Just a little stuck, I think.

1202
00:46:32,065 --> 00:46:33,998
Well,
pull your shoulders together

1203
00:46:34,032 --> 00:46:35,206
and suck it in.

1204
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,968
[Connor]:
Yeah, still not working.

1205
00:46:39,003 --> 00:46:42,040
[Jack]: I got you, buddy...

1206
00:46:42,075 --> 00:46:43,076

Not helping.

1210
00:46:46,942 --> 00:46:48,357
Relax, everyone.

1211
00:46:48,391 --> 00:46:50,290
I'll...
I'll melt the butter.

1212
00:46:50,324 --> 00:46:51,394
[sighs]

1213
00:46:53,293 --> 00:46:54,881
Oh, my.

1214
00:46:57,573 --> 00:46:58,919
Are you sure
you're okay?

1215
00:46:58,954 --> 00:46:59,989
Yeah, yeah.

1216
00:47:00,024 --> 00:47:01,439
Yeah, I'm fine.

1217
00:47:01,473 --> 00:47:02,923
I just, uh, you know,
came down on a wrong angle...

1218
00:47:02,958 --> 00:47:04,338
or something.

1219
00:47:04,373 --> 00:47:06,133
Okay.

1220
00:47:07,652 --> 00:47:11,483
It was a solid
effort, Connor.

1221
00:47:11,518 --> 00:47:13,451
You're a good sport.

1222
00:47:19,491 --> 00:47:20,423
[clears throat]

1223
00:47:24,151 --> 00:47:25,497
Yeah.

1224
00:47:25,532 --> 00:47:28,466
[♪♪♪]

1225
00:47:42,066 --> 00:47:43,274
How's it going?

1226
00:47:43,308 --> 00:47:44,275
Hey.

1227
00:47:44,309 --> 00:47:45,379
[chuckles]

1228
00:47:45,414 --> 00:47:48,624
Uh, it's okay.

1229
00:47:48,658 --> 00:47:52,145
Um, listen,
about today...

1230
00:47:52,179 --> 00:47:53,146
Oh, yeah.

1231
00:47:53,180 --> 00:47:53,974
Yeah, that went well.

1232
00:47:54,009 --> 00:47:55,665
Yeah...

1233
00:47:55,700 --> 00:47:57,391
Listen, that
was my own stupidity,

1234
00:47:57,426 --> 00:48:00,222
like, thinking I could
actually slide down a chimney.

1235
00:48:00,256 --> 00:48:02,293
It's not like I'm your dad
or anything.

1236
00:48:02,327 --> 00:48:03,984
What I should
be able to do

1237
00:48:04,019 --> 00:48:05,399
is make a toy

1238
00:48:05,434 --> 00:48:08,057
that kids actually
want to play with.

1239
00:48:08,092 --> 00:48:09,921
But for whatever reason,

1240
00:48:09,956 --> 00:48:10,922
I don't know what to do

1241
00:48:10,957 --> 00:48:12,268
to make it better
or more fun

1242
00:48:12,303 --> 00:48:14,098
or whatever it is
I've got to do to this thing

1243
00:48:14,132 --> 00:48:16,410
to make it
more interesting to kids.

1244
00:48:17,653 --> 00:48:18,930
I guess
I could make an app

1245
00:48:18,965 --> 00:48:21,277
or add some lights
or something,

1246
00:48:21,312 --> 00:48:23,452
but that's kind of
like, plffft!

1247
00:48:25,764 --> 00:48:31,184
You know, once my dad
gave me a doll,

1248
00:48:31,218 --> 00:48:35,602
and it was kind of
an ugly doll,

1249
00:48:35,636 --> 00:48:37,086
to be honest.

1250
00:48:37,121 --> 00:48:39,088
It was one of
the elves' prototypes,

1251
00:48:39,123 --> 00:48:41,125
and it didn't
quite work out.

1252
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:43,092
And I didn't want
to play with it,

1253
00:48:43,127 --> 00:48:45,198
and so it just sat
on my bedroom shelf

1254
00:48:45,232 --> 00:48:47,476
for months and months.

1255
00:48:47,510 --> 00:48:50,099
And then one day
I spilled hot cocoa

1256
00:48:50,134 --> 00:48:54,207
and I got the
doll's dress dirty,

1257
00:48:54,241 --> 00:48:58,280
and so I picked her up
and I started cleaning her.

1258
00:48:58,314 --> 00:49:04,010
And the moment that doll
was in my hands,

1259
00:49:04,044 --> 00:49:05,632
it was like magic.

1260
00:49:05,666 --> 00:49:09,532
I cleaned her,
I dressed her,

1261
00:49:09,567 --> 00:49:10,533
and for the first time,

1262
00:49:10,568 --> 00:49:12,708
I played with her,

1263
00:49:12,742 --> 00:49:14,020
and from that moment on,

1264
00:49:14,054 --> 00:49:16,712
she was my
most favorite doll.

1265
00:49:16,746 --> 00:49:20,026
So, you see,

1266
00:49:20,060 --> 00:49:23,236
sometimes you just
have to get the toy

1267
00:49:23,270 --> 00:49:25,134
into the child's hands

1268
00:49:25,169 --> 00:49:27,965
for them to realize
how wonderful it is.

1269
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,594
You'll get it.

1270
00:49:38,596 --> 00:49:40,253
Thanks.

1271
00:49:45,327 --> 00:49:46,466
Hmm.

1272
00:49:50,815 --> 00:49:54,577
Oh, my, Mr. Claus
smells something yummy

1273
00:49:54,612 --> 00:49:58,305
from Mrs. Claus' kitchen.

1274
00:49:58,340 --> 00:50:00,652
Ho-ho, good morning, dumpling.

1275
00:50:00,687 --> 00:50:02,102
Where are the children?

1276
00:50:02,137 --> 00:50:04,070
Holly is out
feeding the animals,

1277
00:50:04,104 --> 00:50:05,795
and I have Connor
chopping firewood.

1278
00:50:05,830 --> 00:50:07,659
Ooh.

1279
00:50:09,178 --> 00:50:10,662
Nicholas,

1280
00:50:10,697 --> 00:50:13,562
do you have any,
you know, concerns

1281
00:50:13,596 --> 00:50:16,151
about Connor's
abilities?

1282
00:50:16,185 --> 00:50:18,153
I mean, when I first met you,

1283
00:50:18,187 --> 00:50:19,568
you at least could polish off
a couple dozen of my cookies.

1284
00:50:19,602 --> 00:50:22,847
Ah, well, I always had
a good appetite.

1285
00:50:22,881 --> 00:50:26,644
But we still had our doubts
about me.

1286
00:50:27,645 --> 00:50:29,371
Like when you forgot
to harness the reindeer

1287
00:50:29,405 --> 00:50:30,751
and they took off
without you.

1288
00:50:34,341 --> 00:50:37,655
You sure whipped me
into shape.

1289
00:50:37,689 --> 00:50:40,209
And Holly will do
the same for him.

1290
00:50:40,244 --> 00:50:42,867
Besides, the boy has
plenty of Christmas spirit.

1291
00:50:42,901 --> 00:50:44,041
That will get him through.

1292
00:50:45,249 --> 00:50:46,698
[sighing] I don't know.

1293
00:50:46,733 --> 00:50:47,872
Look.

1294
00:50:47,906 --> 00:50:49,736
I tell you what.

1295
00:50:49,770 --> 00:50:52,187
I'll think of a task
I'm sure he can do.

1296
00:50:52,221 --> 00:50:53,740
Hmm?

1297
00:50:53,774 --> 00:50:54,775
Okay.

1298
00:50:56,294 --> 00:50:57,295
Don't touch that...

1299
00:50:58,641 --> 00:50:59,884
Oh, boy.

1300
00:50:59,918 --> 00:51:03,301
Oh, Connor, my boy.

1301
00:51:03,336 --> 00:51:04,406
Just stacking some wood.

1302
00:51:04,440 --> 00:51:05,614
Oh, don't worry
about that.

1303
00:51:05,648 --> 00:51:07,236
I've got another job
for you.

1304
00:51:07,271 --> 00:51:09,376
Job? What kind of job?

1305
00:51:09,411 --> 00:51:12,138
Well, the elves are having
their siesta,

1306
00:51:12,172 --> 00:51:13,829
but I need some toys.

1307
00:51:13,863 --> 00:51:14,795
I was going to get Connor
to go down to the factory

1308
00:51:14,830 --> 00:51:15,900
and fill this up

1309
00:51:15,934 --> 00:51:17,281
while I get
some work done

1310
00:51:17,315 --> 00:51:18,765
in the office.

1311
00:51:18,799 --> 00:51:20,111
I could do that.

1312
00:51:20,146 --> 00:51:21,906
Um, actually,

1313
00:51:21,940 --> 00:51:25,737
I need your help
in the office,

1314
00:51:25,772 --> 00:51:27,325
you know what I mean?

1315
00:51:27,360 --> 00:51:28,602
-Mm-hmm.
-Mm-hmm.

1316
00:51:29,845 --> 00:51:31,329
Just get
what's on the list,

1317
00:51:31,364 --> 00:51:35,126
and make sure
to be very, very quiet

1318
00:51:35,161 --> 00:51:37,128
so you don't wake up
the elves...

1319
00:51:37,163 --> 00:51:39,234
Or else they'll get
real cranky.

1320
00:51:39,268 --> 00:51:40,718
Got it.

1321
00:51:40,752 --> 00:51:42,168
Don't wake up the elves.

1322
00:51:42,202 --> 00:51:43,928
[chuckling] Good man.

1323
00:51:43,962 --> 00:51:45,585
There we go.

[elves snoring]

1325
00:51:59,978 --> 00:52:02,153
Oh yeah!

1327
00:52:19,860 --> 00:52:22,656
I think he's got this
in the bag!

00:52:25,349 --> 00:52:26,177

00:52:26,212 --> 00:52:27,696
Aw!

Heave, ho-ho-ho!

1336
00:52:44,816 --> 00:52:46,266
Heave! Good.

00:52:56,518 --> 00:52:57,864
You sure these
are the right size?

1340
00:52:57,898 --> 00:52:59,245
Yes.

1341

00:53:00,832 --> 00:53:02,420

Robin,
you're the best.

1345
00:53:26,272 --> 00:53:27,238
I know.

1346
00:53:27,273 --> 00:53:28,412
[laughs heartily]

1347
00:53:30,759 --> 00:53:33,313
You're looking very sharp
for the big day, Snowball.

[Snowball grunts]

1349
00:53:34,349 --> 00:53:36,454
What? Oh. No.

1350
00:53:36,489 --> 00:53:38,353
I haven't told him yet,

1351
00:53:38,387 --> 00:53:39,354
but I will.

1352
00:53:39,388 --> 00:53:41,356
I mean, there's no rush.

1353
00:53:41,390 --> 00:53:42,840
We haven't even set
a date yet.

1354
00:53:44,048 --> 00:53:45,256
Rush what?

1355
00:53:46,533 --> 00:53:47,914
Um...

1356
00:53:47,948 --> 00:53:50,261
I was... I was just
telling Snowball

1357
00:53:50,296 --> 00:53:52,608
that, now that we're engaged,

1358
00:53:52,643 --> 00:53:54,058
that we don't have to
rush getting married.

1359
00:53:54,092 --> 00:53:55,266
We can take our time

1360
00:53:55,301 --> 00:53:56,509
and set a date
and plan, and...

1361
00:53:56,543 --> 00:53:58,338
You know, actually,
I was thinking

1362
00:53:58,373 --> 00:54:01,030
maybe we could...
we could do that sooner

1363
00:54:01,065 --> 00:54:01,928
rather than later.

1364
00:54:03,412 --> 00:54:05,587
Uh, sooner...

1365
00:54:07,554 --> 00:54:10,523
Okay, uh, well,
the summer is always nice.

1366
00:54:10,557 --> 00:54:13,491
And the... Oh, the fall
would be beautiful,

1367
00:54:13,526 --> 00:54:14,872
with all the leaves...

1368
00:54:14,906 --> 00:54:17,461
I was actually thinking
this Christmas.

1369
00:54:20,705 --> 00:54:21,637
This Christmas?

1370
00:54:21,672 --> 00:54:23,363
Yeah. Why not?

1371
00:54:23,398 --> 00:54:24,364
We're already here,

1372
00:54:24,399 --> 00:54:25,538
your family's here,

1373
00:54:25,572 --> 00:54:26,677
Mario, the elves...

1374
00:54:26,711 --> 00:54:28,610
Oh, plus your dad
will be done

1375
00:54:28,644 --> 00:54:30,025
delivering all
the presents.

1376
00:54:30,059 --> 00:54:31,337
He can kick back,

1377
00:54:31,371 --> 00:54:32,683
have an extra egg nog
or two...

1378
00:54:32,717 --> 00:54:34,443
But what about
your parents?

1379
00:54:34,478 --> 00:54:35,651
Well, first of all,

1380
00:54:35,686 --> 00:54:36,790
my parents are in
Florida vacationing,

1381
00:54:36,825 --> 00:54:38,447
like they do
every Christmas.

1382
00:54:38,482 --> 00:54:39,724
Second of all,
they eloped themselves,

1383
00:54:39,759 --> 00:54:41,036
I already talked
to them on the phone,

1384
00:54:41,070 --> 00:54:43,383
and they're great with it.

1385
00:54:43,418 --> 00:54:46,490
[♪♪♪]

1386
00:54:49,562 --> 00:54:51,391
[bouquet freezes, cracks]

1387
00:54:57,949 --> 00:54:59,606
Mm!

1388
00:54:59,641 --> 00:55:01,367
Is that
your holiday stew?

1389
00:55:01,401 --> 00:55:02,644
Mm, yes, it is.

1390
00:55:02,678 --> 00:55:04,335
A couple bowls of this

1391
00:55:04,370 --> 00:55:05,440
has kept your father going
all Christmas

1392
00:55:05,474 --> 00:55:07,545
for almost 30 years.

1393
00:55:07,580 --> 00:55:09,892
I thought a bowl or two
might help Connor along.

1394
00:55:09,927 --> 00:55:10,755
Yeah.

1395
00:55:10,790 --> 00:55:12,654
Yeah.

1396
00:55:12,688 --> 00:55:13,724
Um, speaking of Connor,

1397
00:55:13,758 --> 00:55:15,450
we have set a wedding date.

1398
00:55:15,484 --> 00:55:16,796
You did? When?

1399
00:55:16,830 --> 00:55:18,556
Christmas Day.

1400
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:19,661
Oh, honey, that
gives us plenty of time...

1401
00:55:19,695 --> 00:55:21,145
Christmas Day this year.

1402
00:55:21,179 --> 00:55:23,803
Good golly gumdrops,
Holly Claus!

1403
00:55:23,837 --> 00:55:25,460
That's in less
than a week!

1404
00:55:25,494 --> 00:55:26,530
I know, but he was
just so excited

1405
00:55:26,564 --> 00:55:27,531
about being here,

1406
00:55:27,565 --> 00:55:29,567
and us being here, and...

1407
00:55:29,602 --> 00:55:31,120
So he already knows?

1408
00:55:31,155 --> 00:55:33,433
Actually, I wanted to give him a
little bit more time to...

1409
00:55:33,468 --> 00:55:34,365
Oh, Holly, really...

1410
00:55:34,400 --> 00:55:35,987
Mom, please.

1411
00:55:36,022 --> 00:55:38,680
I just think
that if can complete one task,

1412
00:55:38,714 --> 00:55:40,854
he's going to feel
a lot better about this.

1413
00:55:40,889 --> 00:55:46,515
Well, let's see
if he could handle...

1414
00:55:46,550 --> 00:55:47,136
the sleigh.

1415
00:55:47,171 --> 00:55:48,414
Perfect!

1416
00:55:48,448 --> 00:55:50,519
Except, for now,

1417
00:55:50,554 --> 00:55:52,901
let's keep the reindeer
out of it.

1418
00:55:52,935 --> 00:55:54,696
Right.

1419
00:55:54,730 --> 00:55:56,042
All right,
these new hydraulics

1420
00:55:56,076 --> 00:55:58,458
should take some of the load
off the reindeer

1421
00:55:58,493 --> 00:56:00,633
so you can get
to where you need to go

1422
00:56:00,667 --> 00:56:02,462
faster.

1423
00:56:02,497 --> 00:56:03,670
Ooh!

1424
00:56:05,707 --> 00:56:07,571
You guys needed me?

1425
00:56:07,605 --> 00:56:09,676
Oh, yeah,
um, sweetie,

1426
00:56:09,711 --> 00:56:10,919
Mario just added
hydraulics

1427
00:56:10,953 --> 00:56:11,920
to the sleigh.

1428
00:56:11,954 --> 00:56:15,510
To ease the load.

1429
00:56:15,544 --> 00:56:16,925
And we were hoping

1430
00:56:16,959 --> 00:56:18,513
that you might
test-drive it for us,

1431
00:56:18,547 --> 00:56:19,997
considering
you probably know

1432
00:56:20,031 --> 00:56:21,619
a little more about this
than Dad.

1433
00:56:21,654 --> 00:56:22,793
[Nick]: Oh, yeah,

1434
00:56:22,827 --> 00:56:24,898
I'm used to
using reindeer dust.

1435
00:56:24,933 --> 00:56:26,935
[Connor]: Absolutely.

1436
00:56:26,969 --> 00:56:28,454
Yeah, I used to build
go-karts when I was a kid.

1437
00:56:28,488 --> 00:56:30,041
I got this.

1438
00:56:30,076 --> 00:56:31,974
-Oh!
-Climb aboard, captain.

1439
00:56:32,975 --> 00:56:35,633
Okay, so, what have we got?

1440
00:56:35,668 --> 00:56:37,532
These ones start it up.

1441
00:56:37,566 --> 00:56:38,498
This one gives it the lift.

1442
00:56:38,533 --> 00:56:39,982
But right now,

1443
00:56:40,017 --> 00:56:41,777
you just want to ease it
out of the barn

1444
00:56:41,812 --> 00:56:43,607
in a hover.

1445
00:56:43,641 --> 00:56:44,711
You got it?

1446
00:56:44,746 --> 00:56:45,885
Got it.

1447
00:56:45,919 --> 00:56:47,576
All right!

1448
00:56:47,611 --> 00:56:49,198
Good man, good man.

1449
00:56:51,511 --> 00:56:52,995
Here we go.

1450
00:56:53,030 --> 00:56:54,618
[starts engine,

00:56:54,652 --> 00:56:56,482

1452
00:56:56,516 --> 00:56:57,483
[Connor]:
That was festive. Good tune!

1453
00:56:57,517 --> 00:56:58,656
[Nick chuckles] Yeah!

1455
00:57:00,658 --> 00:57:02,488
[Nick]: Attaboy, attaboy.

1456
00:57:02,522 --> 00:57:03,765
[RPMs increase smoothly]

1457
00:57:03,799 --> 00:57:04,697
Sounds good.

1458
00:57:04,731 --> 00:57:05,801
-Yeah.
-Yeah!

1459
00:57:05,836 --> 00:57:07,734
It sounds
like it's warmed up.

1460
00:57:07,769 --> 00:57:11,082
So now,
just go up into a hover.

1461
00:57:13,119 --> 00:57:15,052
-Here I go.
-Here you go, here you go.

1462
00:57:15,086 --> 00:57:16,053

1820
01:16:23,302 --> 01:16:24,614
Holly, please.

1821
01:16:24,649 --> 01:16:26,236
How can you say that?

1822
01:16:26,271 --> 01:16:27,721
It's only ever
been about you.

1823
01:16:27,755 --> 01:16:29,136
I mean, look at us.

1824
01:16:29,170 --> 01:16:31,103
We've been a team
since we were kids.

1825
01:16:32,415 --> 01:16:34,141
I love you.

1826
01:16:34,175 --> 01:16:35,349
You know what,

1827
01:16:35,383 --> 01:16:36,902
if actually cared,

1828
01:16:36,937 --> 01:16:39,146
I might try to believe you.

1829
01:16:39,180 --> 01:16:40,147
But I don't.

1830
01:16:40,181 --> 01:16:41,631
Holly.

1831
01:16:41,666 --> 01:16:42,908
Come on,
of course you care.

1832
01:16:42,943 --> 01:16:44,427
You're Holly Claus.

1833
01:16:44,461 --> 01:16:46,118
The most important thing
in the world to you

1834
01:16:46,153 --> 01:16:47,810
is Christmas.

1835
01:16:47,844 --> 01:16:52,331
So, really,
if you care about Christmas,

1836
01:16:52,366 --> 01:16:54,851
you care about us.

1837
01:16:57,302 --> 01:16:58,683
You're right.

1838
01:16:58,717 --> 01:17:00,305
I do care about Christmas.

1839
01:17:01,720 --> 01:17:02,687
I knew it.

1840
01:17:02,721 --> 01:17:04,343
So, what do you say?

1841
01:17:04,378 --> 01:17:08,209
Shall we make this
official? Hmm?

1842
01:17:08,244 --> 01:17:10,798
All right.

1843
01:17:10,833 --> 01:17:14,768
I'm officially taking over
the role of Santa.

1844
01:17:15,769 --> 01:17:16,908
What did you say?

1845
01:17:16,942 --> 01:17:18,288
I'm going to do it.

1846
01:17:18,323 --> 01:17:19,255
I'm going to do the job.

1847
01:17:19,289 --> 01:17:20,256
[laughs]

1848
01:17:21,878 --> 01:17:23,431
That's... That's golden.

1849
01:17:23,466 --> 01:17:24,743
Oh, man...

1850
01:17:24,778 --> 01:17:28,264
You, as Santa,
with the belly...

1851
01:17:28,298 --> 01:17:30,369
and the beard!

1852
01:17:30,404 --> 01:17:31,923
I'm serious, Jack.

1853
01:17:31,957 --> 01:17:32,924
Why not?

1854
01:17:32,958 --> 01:17:35,374
As long as the job
gets done.

1855
01:17:35,409 --> 01:17:37,756
And I know I can do it.

1856
01:17:40,759 --> 01:17:41,760
Don't be
ridiculous, Holly.

1857
01:17:41,795 --> 01:17:42,934
I should be Santa.

1858
01:17:42,968 --> 01:17:43,900
Not you.

1859
01:17:43,935 --> 01:17:45,902
I mean, come on.

1860
01:17:45,937 --> 01:17:48,387
Do you know how many years
I've been working towards this,

1861
01:17:48,422 --> 01:17:50,804
with you
and your family?

1862
01:17:50,838 --> 01:17:52,909
Do you know how many
of your mom's cookies

1863
01:17:52,944 --> 01:17:53,945
I've had to choke down
over the years

1864
01:17:53,979 --> 01:17:55,774
to get here?

1865
01:17:55,809 --> 01:17:57,949
Oh, I thought you loved
my cookies.

1866
01:17:57,983 --> 01:18:01,918
Uh... Of course
I love your cookies, Momma.

1867
01:18:01,953 --> 01:18:02,954
I was just
saying that...

1868
01:18:02,988 --> 01:18:04,438
Oh, save it, Jack.

1869
01:18:04,472 --> 01:18:05,957
And do me a favor.
Take off the jacket.

1870
01:18:05,991 --> 01:18:07,959
And don't call me "Momma".

1871
01:18:20,074 --> 01:18:21,835
[wind howling]

1872
01:18:26,805 --> 01:18:27,461
You're making
the biggest mistake

1873
01:18:27,495 --> 01:18:28,738
of your life.

1874
01:18:30,015 --> 01:18:31,776
I'll take that chance.

1875
01:18:41,578 --> 01:18:42,787
[door closes]

1876
01:18:45,030 --> 01:18:46,860
So...

1877
01:18:46,894 --> 01:18:49,897
You are going to follow
in your father's footsteps?

1878
01:18:49,932 --> 01:18:53,349
Oh, I'm going to try.

1879
01:18:53,383 --> 01:18:55,075
Oh!

1880
01:18:55,109 --> 01:18:57,456
You think Dad
will be okay with it?

1881
01:18:57,491 --> 01:18:59,562
Given that
you're your father's daughter,

1882
01:18:59,596 --> 01:19:01,909
I think he'll be just fine.

1883
01:19:01,944 --> 01:19:03,946
[electronic games beeping]

1884
01:19:06,465 --> 01:19:07,984
This is going
to be weak.

1885
01:19:13,334 --> 01:19:14,853
[chuckles]

1886
01:19:16,544 --> 01:19:18,512
Hey, boys and girls.

1887
01:19:18,546 --> 01:19:21,308
Listen, have I got a toy
for you, okay.

1888
01:19:21,342 --> 01:19:23,034
Now, this toy...

1889
01:19:23,068 --> 01:19:26,520
the batteries
will never, ever, ever run out.

1890
01:19:26,554 --> 01:19:28,177
You'll never
have to charge them.

1891
01:19:28,211 --> 01:19:32,008
Okay, this toy will stand
the test of time, okay,

1892
01:19:32,043 --> 01:19:33,009
and it will be with you

1893
01:19:33,044 --> 01:19:34,562
for as long

1894
01:19:34,597 --> 01:19:35,978
as you're willing
to take care of it.

1895
01:19:37,462 --> 01:19:39,050
This toy...

1896
01:19:43,537 --> 01:19:45,021
[sighs]

1897
01:19:46,229 --> 01:19:47,610
...is Fido.

1898
01:19:47,644 --> 01:19:49,025
This is
ridiculous!

1899
01:19:49,060 --> 01:19:50,233
Come on,

1900
01:19:50,268 --> 01:19:51,890
give the kid one of
my hunky Santa dolls.

1901
01:19:51,925 --> 01:19:53,547
Or try one of my
hunky Santa dolls.

1902
01:19:53,581 --> 01:19:55,135
Okay, for the last time,
it was my idea, okay?

1903
01:19:55,169 --> 01:19:56,032
So drop it.

1904
01:19:56,067 --> 01:19:57,206
Not even.

1905
01:19:57,240 --> 01:19:58,138
Look,
yes, it was.

1906
01:19:58,172 --> 01:19:59,933
[Connor]: Meet Fido.

1907
01:19:59,967 --> 01:20:01,072
[Wesley]: By the way,
a winky face means nothing.

1908
01:20:01,106 --> 01:20:02,867
It just makes you look
like a stalker.

1909
01:20:07,043 --> 01:20:08,389
Hey, can I
have a turn?

1910
01:20:12,048 --> 01:20:13,325
Hey, this is cool.

1911
01:20:13,360 --> 01:20:16,570
-What is it?
-It's a toy dog!

1912
01:20:16,604 --> 01:20:17,571
[kids chatter excitedly]

1913
01:20:17,605 --> 01:20:19,193
[kids laugh]

1914
01:20:19,228 --> 01:20:21,195
I like its ears.

1915
01:20:21,230 --> 01:20:23,266
Yeah, he looks
really cool.

1916
01:20:23,301 --> 01:20:25,924
-Wow!
-Wow, I love it.

1917
01:20:25,959 --> 01:20:27,546
[excited chatter continues]

1918
01:20:29,583 --> 01:20:32,068
Brilliant, Connor,

1919
01:20:32,103 --> 01:20:34,105
just brilliant.

1920
01:20:34,139 --> 01:20:35,520
Work with me.

1921
01:20:37,039 --> 01:20:39,489
That was one heck
of a presentation.

1922
01:20:39,524 --> 01:20:41,250
Holy Dinah.

1923
01:20:41,284 --> 01:20:42,941
And I've got to say, Connor,

1924
01:20:42,976 --> 01:20:46,013
this whole time,
I knew you had it in you.

1925
01:20:46,048 --> 01:20:47,118
Wesley!

1926
01:20:47,152 --> 01:20:48,913
-I'm right here, Mr....
-Geez!

1927
01:20:48,947 --> 01:20:50,086
Wesley, let's
get this toy ready

1928
01:20:50,121 --> 01:20:51,363
to roll out
into production,

1929
01:20:51,398 --> 01:20:53,262
ASAP!

1930
01:20:53,296 --> 01:20:54,988
Got it.

1931
01:20:55,022 --> 01:20:58,025
And let's cut the order
of hunky Santa dolls

1932
01:20:58,060 --> 01:20:59,302
in half.

1933
01:20:59,337 --> 01:21:01,270
I want to double up
on Fido.

1934
01:21:01,304 --> 01:21:03,306
[Kelly]: Oh, no. Really?

1935
01:21:03,341 --> 01:21:07,897
I am so sorry your idea
didn't pan out, Wesley.

1936
01:21:07,932 --> 01:21:09,934
[Wegman]: Okay,
so much bickering.

1937
01:21:09,968 --> 01:21:11,970
Let's go.
Back to work.

1938
01:21:12,005 --> 01:21:14,041
The classic toys
are back!

1939
01:21:20,392 --> 01:21:22,360
[chuckling]
Whoa, Connor...

1940
01:21:22,394 --> 01:21:23,706
A little success

1941
01:21:23,740 --> 01:21:26,536
has given you
quite the appetite.

1942
01:21:26,571 --> 01:21:28,055
That's a lot
of donuts.

1943
01:21:32,232 --> 01:21:34,061
Ha! I can do it!

1944
01:21:34,751 --> 01:21:35,718
You can do it?

1945
01:21:35,752 --> 01:21:36,684
Look, I can do it!

1946
01:21:36,719 --> 01:21:38,031
You can do it.

1947
01:21:38,065 --> 01:21:38,894
Do it!

1948
01:21:40,033 --> 01:21:42,552
I can do it.
I did that!

1949
01:21:43,553 --> 01:21:45,072
[ringing]

1950
01:21:45,107 --> 01:21:46,556
Cookie break is over.

1951
01:21:46,591 --> 01:21:47,972
Back to work.

1952
01:21:48,006 --> 01:21:50,043
[elves]: Aww!

1953
01:21:50,077 --> 01:21:51,976
Ho, ho, ho!

1954
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,391
How can I help you?

1955
01:21:53,425 --> 01:21:54,323
Mario?

1956
01:21:54,357 --> 01:21:55,324
Hey, it's Connor.

1957
01:21:55,358 --> 01:21:57,291
How you doing, Sasquatch?

1958
01:21:57,326 --> 01:21:58,396
Listen...

1959
01:21:58,430 --> 01:22:00,087
Merry Christmas, Stuart.

1960
01:22:00,122 --> 01:22:00,846
Hey, can you pick me up
at the airport?

1961
01:22:00,881 --> 01:22:03,056
Hey, you bet your tinsel
I can.

1962
01:22:03,090 --> 01:22:04,333
Awesome. Yes!

1963
01:22:04,367 --> 01:22:05,748
Listen... Um...

1964
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:06,956
I'll see you
after the next flight.

1965
01:22:06,991 --> 01:22:07,715
You got it!

1966
01:22:07,750 --> 01:22:08,647
Yeah.

1967
01:22:10,166 --> 01:22:11,996
Oh...

1968
01:22:12,030 --> 01:22:14,101
The stars have aligned.

1969
01:22:15,309 --> 01:22:16,276
Merry Christmas!

1970
01:22:16,310 --> 01:22:17,277
Merry Christmas!

1971
01:22:17,311 --> 01:22:19,624
Merry Christmas, everyone!

1972
01:22:19,658 --> 01:22:21,246
Ho, ho, ho, ho!

1973
01:22:21,281 --> 01:22:22,454
Merry Christmas.

1974
01:22:22,489 --> 01:22:23,628
Merry Christmas.

1975
01:22:23,662 --> 01:22:25,492
Whoo!

1976
01:22:25,526 --> 01:22:26,700
Merry Christmas, sir.

1977
01:22:31,291 --> 01:22:33,017
[sighs]

1978
01:22:33,051 --> 01:22:35,433
All right, Donner,

1979
01:22:35,467 --> 01:22:37,124
seeing as I'm going to be

1980
01:22:37,159 --> 01:22:39,057
the one holding the reins
one day,

1981
01:22:39,092 --> 01:22:40,679
I should probably
get some practice in, huh?

1982
01:22:40,714 --> 01:22:42,578
[Donner vocalizes]

1983
01:22:42,612 --> 01:22:44,131
Well, thank you.

1984
01:22:44,166 --> 01:22:45,753
I appreciate
the vote of confidence.

1985
01:22:45,788 --> 01:22:48,135
I think I can do it too.

1986
01:22:48,170 --> 01:22:50,448
I just wish I didn't
have to do it alone.

1987
01:22:50,482 --> 01:22:51,276
[Connor]: You don't.

1988
01:22:55,315 --> 01:22:57,041
Connor!

1989
01:23:05,049 --> 01:23:08,293
Holly, I am so sorry.

1990
01:23:08,328 --> 01:23:09,708
It's okay.

1991
01:23:09,743 --> 01:23:12,297
No, it's not okay.

1992
01:23:12,332 --> 01:23:15,024
I should never
have left you like I did.

1993
01:23:15,059 --> 01:23:18,269
I should have
talked to you first,

1994
01:23:18,303 --> 01:23:20,064
'cause that's what
couples do, right?

1995
01:23:20,098 --> 01:23:22,100
They talk it out.

1996
01:23:22,135 --> 01:23:24,206
And if I would have
done that,

1997
01:23:24,240 --> 01:23:25,379
then maybe
I would have realized

1998
01:23:25,414 --> 01:23:27,071
that the reason
I wasn't succeeding

1999
01:23:27,105 --> 01:23:29,073
was because of my confidence,

2000
01:23:29,107 --> 01:23:30,384
my lack of it.

2001
01:23:30,419 --> 01:23:32,041
Oh, Connor,

2002
01:23:32,076 --> 01:23:33,318
I never wanted

2003
01:23:33,353 --> 01:23:35,251
to put that kind
of pressure on you...

2004
01:23:37,426 --> 01:23:39,324
which is why I waited
to tell you,

2005
01:23:39,359 --> 01:23:43,328
because I was...
I was afraid.

2006
01:23:43,363 --> 01:23:45,399
And I totally understand
if you don't want to...

2007
01:23:45,434 --> 01:23:47,056
No, no, I do.

2008
01:23:47,091 --> 01:23:49,265
I want to do it.

2009
01:23:50,784 --> 01:23:53,752
I can, Holly.

2010
01:23:55,168 --> 01:23:56,238
You watch me.

2011
01:23:58,447 --> 01:24:01,415
[♪♪♪]

2012
01:24:01,450 --> 01:24:02,416
Here I come!

2013
01:24:10,114 --> 01:24:12,564
-Whoa!
-Whoa!

2014
01:24:12,599 --> 01:24:15,498
Oh, my, my, my!

2015
01:24:15,533 --> 01:24:17,845
[♪♪♪]

2016
01:24:26,371 --> 01:24:27,338
[cheering]

2017
01:24:29,236 --> 01:24:30,686
And remember,

2018
01:24:30,720 --> 01:24:34,897
a busy elf
is a happy elf.

2019
01:24:34,931 --> 01:24:36,278
Ha, ha, ha!

2020
01:24:36,312 --> 01:24:39,108
All right, Ewing,
loading it up.

2021
01:24:39,143 --> 01:24:40,834
Yeah!

2022
01:24:40,868 --> 01:24:43,216
With the legs... Yeah.

2023
01:24:44,424 --> 01:24:48,393
Ho, ho, how do I look?

2024
01:24:48,428 --> 01:24:49,636
Oh, honey, well,

2025
01:24:49,670 --> 01:24:50,706
you're a little skinnier
than last year,

2026
01:24:50,740 --> 01:24:51,741
but otherwise
pretty perfect.

2027
01:24:51,776 --> 01:24:53,122
Rudolph
just rolled in.

2028
01:24:53,157 --> 01:24:53,847
Oh!

2029
01:24:53,881 --> 01:24:55,297
Oh, thank goodness.

2030
01:24:55,331 --> 01:24:56,194
He always gets here
at the last minute.

2031
01:24:56,229 --> 01:24:57,264
[Nick]: All right.

2032
01:24:57,299 --> 01:24:58,610
Now we're all here,

2033
01:24:58,645 --> 01:25:00,440
I guess it's time
to get this show on the road.

2034
01:25:00,474 --> 01:25:01,717
Connor...

2035
01:25:01,751 --> 01:25:03,546
You'd best get a jacket
or something.

2036
01:25:03,581 --> 01:25:05,445
It gets a bit chilly
up there.

2037
01:25:05,479 --> 01:25:06,549
I'm sorry, where?

2038
01:25:06,584 --> 01:25:07,826
In the sleigh.

2039
01:25:07,861 --> 01:25:09,380
You're coming with me,
aren't you?

2040
01:25:09,414 --> 01:25:11,554
I mean, you need
at least a few practice runs.

2041
01:25:11,589 --> 01:25:12,624
Yes, sir.

2042
01:25:12,659 --> 01:25:14,316
I mean, Santa.

2043
01:25:14,350 --> 01:25:15,800
Yeah, absolutely
I'll go up there with you.

2044
01:25:15,834 --> 01:25:16,939
Then let's do this.

2045
01:25:16,973 --> 01:25:17,595
Ha, ha, ha!

2046
01:25:17,629 --> 01:25:19,321
Whoo!

2047
01:25:19,355 --> 01:25:21,150
[chuckling]

2048
01:25:21,185 --> 01:25:23,290
Come on, everyone!

2049
01:25:23,325 --> 01:25:25,810
My favorite night
of the year!

2050
01:25:25,844 --> 01:25:27,294
Now, I packed
some extra socks...

2051
01:25:27,329 --> 01:25:28,640
Oh, I've got extra socks.

2052
01:25:28,675 --> 01:25:30,297
And some
little snacks,

2053
01:25:30,332 --> 01:25:31,643
and I've got
a lunch for you...

2054
01:25:31,678 --> 01:25:32,748
I don't need lunch.

2055
01:25:32,782 --> 01:25:33,956
I'll be eating
cookies all night.

2056
01:25:33,990 --> 01:25:35,509
Okay, okay.

2057
01:25:35,544 --> 01:25:36,648
Bye-bye, bye-bye.

2058
01:25:36,683 --> 01:25:37,822
Good night.

2059
01:25:37,856 --> 01:25:39,720
-Have a good time.
-Yeah.

2060
01:25:39,755 --> 01:25:40,652
-One more.
-Aw.

2061
01:25:40,928 --> 01:25:41,791
Are you
all right?

2062
01:25:41,826 --> 01:25:42,861
Yeah.

2063
01:25:42,896 --> 01:25:43,793
No, I'm better
than all right.

2064
01:25:43,828 --> 01:25:44,794
I'm great.

2065
01:25:44,829 --> 01:25:46,279
Hop in, Connor.

2066
01:25:46,313 --> 01:25:47,866
There's plenty of room.

2067
01:25:47,901 --> 01:25:49,661
Room for two?

2068
01:25:49,696 --> 01:25:51,215
Because this generation
of Clauses

2069
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:52,802
is going to do it
together.

2070
01:25:52,837 --> 01:25:54,356
Really?

2071
01:25:54,390 --> 01:25:55,322
Yeah.

2072
01:25:55,357 --> 01:25:56,289
That's my girl.

2073
01:25:56,323 --> 01:25:57,290
Come on, come on.

2074
01:25:57,324 --> 01:25:59,533
Oh, there's my girl.

2075
01:25:59,568 --> 01:26:02,881
Oh, you look
right at home there, Connor.

2076
01:26:02,916 --> 01:26:05,401
Now, will you both
do the honors?

2077
01:26:06,575 --> 01:26:07,576
On...

2078
01:26:07,610 --> 01:26:08,577
[together] Dasher and Dancer

2079
01:26:08,611 --> 01:26:10,234
and Prancer and Vixen!

2080
01:26:10,268 --> 01:26:11,235
On Comet and Cupid

2081
01:26:11,269 --> 01:26:12,719
and Donner and Blitzen!

2082
01:26:12,753 --> 01:26:13,789
And you too, Rudolph!

2083
01:26:13,823 --> 01:26:15,584
Yeah!

2084
01:26:15,618 --> 01:26:16,792
To the top of the porch,
to the top of the wall!

2085
01:26:16,826 --> 01:26:18,380
Now dash away! Dash away!

2086
01:26:18,414 --> 01:26:19,967
Dash away all!

2087
01:26:20,002 --> 01:26:23,419
[excited laughter]

2088
01:26:25,835 --> 01:26:26,905
Bye!

2089
01:26:26,940 --> 01:26:27,941
Merry Christmas!

2090
01:26:27,975 --> 01:26:29,839
[laughter]

2091
01:26:35,811 --> 01:26:37,606
Oh, oh, here.

2092
01:26:38,538 --> 01:26:39,746
Whoo!

2093
01:26:39,780 --> 01:26:41,610
[jolly laugh]

2094
01:26:43,888 --> 01:26:45,924
Oh, whoo!

2095
01:26:47,788 --> 01:26:53,518
And... Merry Christmas!

2096
