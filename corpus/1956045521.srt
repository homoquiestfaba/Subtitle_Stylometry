1
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:39,322
Hey, boys-

2
00:01:46,005 --> 00:01:47,597
Sorry.

3
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,597
I came into this world
out of luck...

4
00:02:12,665 --> 00:02:15,634
and we all know
a man needs luck.

5
00:02:15,702 --> 00:02:19,001
Becoming a sheriff was the first
good thing to come my way-

6
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:23,236
a pretty laid-back job just outside
of Colby University in North Carolina...

7
00:02:23,309 --> 00:02:26,574
the university being the primary
money tree and academic playground...

8
00:02:26,646 --> 00:02:30,082
for the offspring
of the rich and powerful.

9
00:02:30,150 --> 00:02:32,744
Nothing that required
any real police work.

10
00:02:32,819 --> 00:02:38,587
Mostly frat parties, noise complaints
and an occasional DUl.

11
00:02:38,658 --> 00:02:42,594
At least that's the way it was until
I got that call from Dean Comyn.

12
00:02:46,533 --> 00:02:50,367
We've had a little trouble
with one of our students here.

13
00:02:50,436 --> 00:02:52,836
Overdose.

14
00:02:52,906 --> 00:02:57,900
- Isn't that a medical problem?
- Her mother feels it's criminal.

15
00:02:57,977 --> 00:03:01,105
I'm sure you can understand
our position here.

16
00:03:01,181 --> 00:03:04,116
This thing does
have to be investigated.

17
00:03:04,184 --> 00:03:06,675
Sensitively.

18
00:03:06,753 --> 00:03:08,243
- Delicately.
- Right.

19
00:03:08,321 --> 00:03:12,883
Like old Sheriff Perkins
would have done.

20
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:15,860
I'm sure that when the time comes
for the town council...

21
00:03:15,929 --> 00:03:17,897
to name a permanent replacement...

22
00:03:17,964 --> 00:03:23,027
I'll be able to report what a fine job
you have done as acting sheriff...

23
00:03:24,504 --> 00:03:25,971
for us.

24
00:03:44,657 --> 00:03:47,922
You goddamned rich girls.
You think you own the world.

25
00:03:47,994 --> 00:03:50,929
'Cause whenever you mess up,
your daddy just writes a check.

26
00:03:50,997 --> 00:03:53,830
- We didn't do anything to your daughter.
- It was an accident, Mrs. Campbell.

27
00:03:53,900 --> 00:03:57,097
You think I don't know what happened?
You think I don't know what you did?

28
00:03:57,170 --> 00:03:58,569
All right. That's enough.

29
00:03:58,638 --> 00:04:01,801
This bitch tried to kill my daughter.
She's lying in the hospital.

30
00:04:01,874 --> 00:04:06,038
She can't talk. She can't move.
She can't even open her little eyes.

31
00:04:08,248 --> 00:04:10,113
Alicia's her only child, so-

32
00:04:10,183 --> 00:04:13,380
- But she's acting like it's our fault.
- She was our friend.

33
00:04:13,453 --> 00:04:15,250
You don't know how sorry we are.

34
00:04:17,323 --> 00:04:19,951
Okay, well-

35
00:04:20,026 --> 00:04:22,221
Why don't y'all just tell me...

36
00:04:22,295 --> 00:04:24,058
what happened.

37
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:30,766
We were having a party...

38
00:04:30,837 --> 00:04:33,067
and Alicia was drinking.

39
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,199
- She was so loaded.
- She wanted to get high.

40
00:04:38,578 --> 00:04:40,341
Oops.

41
00:04:40,413 --> 00:04:42,404
It's all right.
I ain't going to bust y'all.

42
00:04:42,482 --> 00:04:44,473
I just want to know
what went down.

43
00:04:44,550 --> 00:04:47,644
Like I was saying,
she wanted to do some coke.

44
00:04:47,720 --> 00:04:50,348
And...

45
00:04:50,423 --> 00:04:53,324
I remember hearing someone
downstairs making a lot of noise.

46
00:04:53,393 --> 00:04:56,692
She was jonesing, and she thought there
was stuff hidden in the guest room.

47
00:04:56,763 --> 00:04:58,731
She was tearing the room apart.

48
00:04:58,798 --> 00:05:02,700
She couldn't find any, sol left.

49
00:05:03,970 --> 00:05:05,369
What time was this?

50
00:05:07,106 --> 00:05:09,404
A little before 2:00.

51
00:05:09,475 --> 00:05:12,342
Okay. Go on.

52
00:05:12,412 --> 00:05:17,475
The party had broken up, and Hads
and I were upstairs cleaning up.

53
00:05:17,550 --> 00:05:21,680
She went to bed, and I went
downstairs to get something to eat.

54
00:05:21,754 --> 00:05:26,691
- And I heard this- this crash.
- When?

55
00:05:26,759 --> 00:05:30,126
I don't know. 2:15, maybe.

56
00:05:30,196 --> 00:05:34,758
And I went into the bathroom
and I found her, and-

57
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:39,396
I yelled up to Hadley
to call student health.

58
00:05:39,472 --> 00:05:43,568
And I tried to give her mouth-to-mouth
and I tried to revive her, but-

59
00:05:45,712 --> 00:05:47,270
I just- I couldn't.

60
00:05:47,347 --> 00:05:49,474
Why didn't you call 911?

61
00:05:49,549 --> 00:05:53,212
- We thought it would be-
- Because student health is...

62
00:05:53,286 --> 00:05:56,619
down the street from our house,
and they have a doctor on call 24 hours.

63
00:05:56,689 --> 00:06:01,592
So we thought that she would
be able to get help faster.

64
00:06:05,732 --> 00:06:10,169
Okay. Well, I guess I just need
to take a look at the scene.

65
00:06:35,027 --> 00:06:37,359
Multicolored paper.
I've seen this before.

66
00:06:39,866 --> 00:06:41,629
Y'all didn't touch anything
in here, did you?

67
00:06:41,701 --> 00:06:44,534
- Move anything around?
- No.

68
00:06:44,604 --> 00:06:46,629
What's in there?

69
00:06:46,706 --> 00:06:49,470
The library-
Alicia's room.

70
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:51,874
She kind of moved in on us.

71
00:07:10,663 --> 00:07:12,654
All right.
I guess I'll call y'all...

72
00:07:12,732 --> 00:07:14,666
if I need anything else.

73
00:07:32,351 --> 00:07:33,943
All right.

74
00:07:50,803 --> 00:07:52,998
I'm sorry.
We don't allow flowers in ICU.

75
00:08:01,881 --> 00:08:05,578
Lead, follow or get out of the way.

76
00:08:05,651 --> 00:08:09,610
These eight words will be the focus
of our last semester together...

77
00:08:09,689 --> 00:08:14,490
and how they affect behavior patterns
in the modern American society...

78
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,961
not only macrocosmically
in the so-called real world...

79
00:08:18,030 --> 00:08:21,693
but in the microcosm of the
classroom and the university.

80
00:08:21,767 --> 00:08:23,701
Field-research projects
on the topic...

81
00:08:23,769 --> 00:08:25,737
will comprise 80 percent
of your grade.

82
00:08:25,805 --> 00:08:28,535
Projects to be presented orally
the last week of class.

83
00:08:28,608 --> 00:08:29,973
Orally?

84
00:08:33,246 --> 00:08:35,646
Personally,
I do not like to swallow.

85
00:08:35,715 --> 00:08:38,377
I know. It totally wears
the enamel off my teeth.

86
00:08:38,451 --> 00:08:42,114
I learned this new dribbling technique
where you let it spill out the sides.

87
00:08:44,023 --> 00:08:47,049
- I'm sorry. Can you please be quiet?
- Excuse me?

88
00:08:47,126 --> 00:08:49,890
- Some of us are trying to learn.
- You will work in pairs.

89
00:08:49,962 --> 00:08:54,626
Pairs?
But Professor, if the topic is...

90
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:59,933
lead, follow or get out of the way,
shouldn't we work in teams of three?

91
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:06,807
I'll pair you up myself, thank you.

92
00:09:06,879 --> 00:09:09,575
I'm on my way out of town.
Why don't we talk about this in class.

93
00:09:09,649 --> 00:09:11,844
Hadley, I really think-

94
00:09:11,918 --> 00:09:14,512
I'll do my half, you do yours,
then we'll meet towards the end.

95
00:09:14,587 --> 00:09:17,852
But we have actual places
that we need to visit together.

96
00:09:17,924 --> 00:09:20,256
- And if our data doesn't corroborate-
- We'll deal with it.

97
00:09:20,326 --> 00:09:23,227
- Who's that?
- Attention, Kmart shoppers.

98
00:09:23,296 --> 00:09:25,457
That's the chick
Hadley got stuck with.

99
00:09:25,531 --> 00:09:27,761
Cute.

100
00:09:27,833 --> 00:09:30,495
Hadley, please.
We really need to talk about this.

101
00:09:30,570 --> 00:09:32,367
- No, we don't.
- But, I-

102
00:09:32,438 --> 00:09:34,406
- Airport.
- Yes, ma'am.

103
00:09:47,019 --> 00:09:51,285
I'm interested, Hadley.
You think you've earned this job?

104
00:09:51,357 --> 00:09:55,054
- I don't know.
- Well, at least you're honest.

105
00:09:55,127 --> 00:09:58,255
You think I oughta give you this job?

106
00:09:58,331 --> 00:10:00,026
Yeah. You're my father.

107
00:10:00,099 --> 00:10:02,067
What's that supposed to mean?

108
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:04,898
I'm not running
a general store in Kansas here.

109
00:10:04,971 --> 00:10:08,202
This job has nothing to do with
getting high and listening to music.

110
00:10:09,909 --> 00:10:11,740
Come on.

111
00:10:12,945 --> 00:10:14,640
Come on, Daddy.

112
00:10:19,719 --> 00:10:24,918
It's time you showed initiative,
accomplished something on your own.

113
00:10:24,991 --> 00:10:28,392
Get your grades up.
Then we'll talk about this job.

114
00:10:28,461 --> 00:10:31,828
Want me to get A's, I'll get them.
Want me to kiss your ass, I'll-

115
00:10:31,897 --> 00:10:34,457
I don't have to hire you.
And to be quite honest with you...

116
00:10:34,533 --> 00:10:37,934
I think you'd be better off
if I didn't.

117
00:10:38,004 --> 00:10:40,234
But what else would I do?

118
00:10:55,121 --> 00:10:57,749
- Why are you here?
- I wanted to see her.

119
00:10:57,823 --> 00:11:00,223
See her or be seen?

120
00:11:00,292 --> 00:11:03,352
- Alicia's my friend.
- Don't make me laugh.

121
00:11:03,429 --> 00:11:08,526
- I'm the one who called for help.
- You're the one that gave her drugs.

122
00:11:08,601 --> 00:11:10,068
You're crazy.

123
00:11:10,136 --> 00:11:15,073
If I ever see you near her again,
I will kill you. You understand?

124
00:11:44,303 --> 00:11:46,294
Hi, Alicia.
Come on in.

125
00:11:47,907 --> 00:11:51,070
So, you think you have
what it takes to be a lawyer?

126
00:11:51,143 --> 00:11:53,111
- Yes, ma'am.
- Well...

127
00:11:56,215 --> 00:11:59,946
I have to admit,
your grades are very impressive.

128
00:12:00,019 --> 00:12:02,351
Thank you.
How nice of you to say.

129
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:09,788
I see you've been in the work-study
program since your freshman year.

130
00:12:09,862 --> 00:12:12,422
- Yes, ma'am.
- How you managing?

131
00:12:12,498 --> 00:12:15,695
- I just try and work hard.
- Your parents help you out?

132
00:12:15,768 --> 00:12:18,669
Well, my father's
not around, so-

133
00:12:18,738 --> 00:12:22,196
It's been tough for my mom,
being a single mother and all.

134
00:12:22,274 --> 00:12:25,607
- Tell me about it.
- You're a single mother?

135
00:12:25,678 --> 00:12:29,444
I'm divorced.
It's tough on the kids.

136
00:12:31,317 --> 00:12:33,785
It's been really difficult for us.

137
00:12:36,989 --> 00:12:38,923
Hey, sweetie.

138
00:12:38,991 --> 00:12:41,186
It's okay.
There's nothing to cry about.

139
00:12:41,260 --> 00:12:45,094
- I'm sorry.
- Well,Alicia...

140
00:12:45,164 --> 00:12:50,500
I don't see a reason this application
shouldn't pass with flying colors.

141
00:12:50,569 --> 00:12:53,037
Thank you.

142
00:12:53,105 --> 00:12:55,539
As far as that
financial aid goes...

143
00:12:55,608 --> 00:12:58,771
money is real tight
for us right now.

144
00:13:00,579 --> 00:13:02,171
Tell you what.

145
00:13:02,248 --> 00:13:05,183
I'll look into it.
Let me see if there's anything I can do.

146
00:13:07,820 --> 00:13:11,187
God. I grovelled in front of that lady
for something I completely deserve.

147
00:13:11,257 --> 00:13:14,226
- She made me feel like an alien.
- It's okay to bomb a little.

148
00:13:14,293 --> 00:13:15,624
Oh, my God.
There he is.

149
00:13:25,538 --> 00:13:27,096
Hi, Trevor.

150
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:29,733
- Hi.
- Hi,Trevor.

151
00:13:29,809 --> 00:13:32,744
- Who the hell is that?
- She's nice.

152
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:35,771
What's up, crazy?

153
00:14:35,841 --> 00:14:38,639
Warren, put the camera down
and come here.

154
00:14:41,747 --> 00:14:43,715
Where you going, baby?
Come on.

155
00:14:50,322 --> 00:14:52,449
- Hey, Alicia.
- Hi.

156
00:14:52,524 --> 00:14:56,722
- I know we got off on the wrong foot.
- Amongst other body parts.

157
00:14:56,795 --> 00:14:59,059
But I really need to maintain
my average.

158
00:14:59,131 --> 00:15:01,224
And I need to get an A.

159
00:15:01,300 --> 00:15:05,828
Then let's try to forget this extraneous
stuff and try to work together.

160
00:15:05,905 --> 00:15:10,205
I don't know if my sociology
is going to go with your sociology.

161
00:15:14,113 --> 00:15:16,513
Well,we can try.

162
00:15:19,285 --> 00:15:22,345
Okay, but no holier than thou...

163
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:27,256
no snotty remarks
and no whiny “But, Hadley. “

164
00:16:53,412 --> 00:16:55,437
That's enough for today.

165
00:17:03,655 --> 00:17:06,146
Hey.
You're-

166
00:17:06,225 --> 00:17:07,920
You're pretty good.

167
00:17:07,993 --> 00:17:09,426
I have my moments.

168
00:17:10,963 --> 00:17:12,624
You want to talk about Alicia?

169
00:17:17,703 --> 00:17:21,002
Well?

170
00:17:21,073 --> 00:17:24,440
They must not give you
a lot to do around here.

171
00:17:24,510 --> 00:17:29,004
I'm trying to figure out how Alicia
went from being a total stranger...

172
00:17:29,081 --> 00:17:30,878
to being your best friend...

173
00:17:30,949 --> 00:17:34,851
to now lying in a hospital bed
with tubes running in and out of her.

174
00:17:36,522 --> 00:17:41,016
She fucking OD'd.
Had nothing to do with being my friend.

175
00:17:42,194 --> 00:17:45,186
We got stuck together
on this sociology project.

176
00:17:45,264 --> 00:17:48,290
She kept hounding me.

177
00:17:48,367 --> 00:17:52,428
I kept blowing her off, and suddenly
she was outside the door at the party.

178
00:17:52,504 --> 00:17:53,937
So I decided to invite her in.

179
00:18:16,228 --> 00:18:17,752
Is this a joke?

180
00:18:17,830 --> 00:18:21,027
We wouldn't have let you up
here if this were a joke.

181
00:18:21,100 --> 00:18:23,796
Oh, no. Too “white girl. “
Put it on her.

182
00:18:27,806 --> 00:18:29,467
Very nice.

183
00:18:49,661 --> 00:18:52,061
She cleans up real nice.

184
00:18:52,131 --> 00:18:53,758
Nice job.

185
00:19:01,106 --> 00:19:04,267
Lead, follow
or get out of the way.

186
00:19:06,011 --> 00:19:09,447
All right.
what about the drugs?

187
00:19:09,515 --> 00:19:13,645
None for me, thanks.
But you go right ahead.

188
00:19:13,719 --> 00:19:16,620
I was talking about Alicia.

189
00:19:20,692 --> 00:19:23,183
Well, in the beginning,
Alicia wasn't even into drugs.

190
00:19:23,262 --> 00:19:25,822
- I'll drive.
- No, let Hadley drive.

191
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,627
Not that any of us were either.

192
00:19:27,699 --> 00:19:31,157
- But, you know.
- Yeah. Yeah, I know.

193
00:19:31,236 --> 00:19:35,070
- He was sick before he got in the car.
- Uh-huh. Get in.

194
00:19:43,382 --> 00:19:45,077
Guys, my stepfather told me...

195
00:19:45,150 --> 00:19:48,517
if I get a job, he'll give me
$10,000 to spend however I want.

196
00:19:48,587 --> 00:19:51,681
What's the point of getting a job if
he's going to give you the money anyway?

197
00:19:51,757 --> 00:19:54,385
- To learn the value of money.
- Oh, please!

198
00:19:54,459 --> 00:19:56,222
Tell me that you see
the irony in this.

199
00:19:56,295 --> 00:19:58,092
You don't have to do anything.
just tell me you see it.

200
00:19:58,163 --> 00:20:01,997
- It's not like he's buying me a car.
- You guys are so lucky.

201
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:05,298
- Why?
- Because you're free.

202
00:20:05,370 --> 00:20:07,895
- Aren't you?
- It takes money to be free.

203
00:20:07,973 --> 00:20:10,771
- Speaking of which-
- Relax. It's here.

204
00:20:10,842 --> 00:20:13,811
- I know I have it.
- Isn't this the turnoff to Max's?

205
00:20:13,879 --> 00:20:16,404
Wait. Max Tamer?

206
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:19,416
- Private moment.
- It's in my panties.

207
00:20:19,484 --> 00:20:21,076
- Your panties?
- Wait. The drug dealer?

208
00:20:21,153 --> 00:20:24,680
- You saving tips from the titty bar?
- I thought it would be safe.

209
00:20:24,756 --> 00:20:27,418
You know what?
I'd like to get out of the car.

210
00:20:27,492 --> 00:20:30,017
Sid, your panties are hardly
the Fort Knox of the undergarment world.

211
00:20:30,095 --> 00:20:33,496
- Oh, and you should talk.
- Do you even wear panties?

212
00:20:33,565 --> 00:20:35,089
Today.

213
00:20:54,453 --> 00:20:56,944
- Hi.
- Hello.

214
00:20:58,557 --> 00:21:00,855
Don't worry.
You're not doing anything illegal.

215
00:21:00,926 --> 00:21:03,793
- I'm not?
- No. You're just the lookout.

216
00:21:03,862 --> 00:21:07,559
Hadley, if I get caught,
I'm gonna get kicked out of school.

217
00:21:07,633 --> 00:21:10,158
I'll lose my scholarship.
No law school-

218
00:21:10,235 --> 00:21:11,896
Relax. This is college.

219
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:18,301
So if she wasn't into drugs,
then how did she OD?

220
00:21:20,512 --> 00:21:22,912
I think maybe she tried
to kill herself.

221
00:21:26,551 --> 00:21:31,386
In the microcosm
of the classroom and university.

222
00:21:31,456 --> 00:21:36,359
Field-research projects on the topic
will comprise 80 percent of your grade.

223
00:21:46,905 --> 00:21:50,898
- Oh, this looks like fun.
- Be nice. They're children.

224
00:21:50,976 --> 00:21:53,911
Lead, follow
or get out of the way.

225
00:21:53,979 --> 00:21:56,038
A sociological examination...

226
00:21:56,114 --> 00:21:59,208
of poor kids placed
in a privileged educational environment.

227
00:21:59,284 --> 00:22:02,811
- What cartoons do you guys watch?
- Nickelodeon and Cartoon Network.

228
00:22:02,888 --> 00:22:05,322
- Really?
- Fox Family.

229
00:22:05,390 --> 00:22:07,187
- Do you guys watch the news?
- No.

230
00:22:07,259 --> 00:22:09,727
- What are we going to do now?
- I Spy.

231
00:22:09,795 --> 00:22:11,922
What do you want to look at?

232
00:22:13,665 --> 00:22:15,155
- This?What?
- No. This.

233
00:22:15,233 --> 00:22:18,259
Hey, how come you're not
eating with the other kids?

234
00:22:18,337 --> 00:22:20,965
They're stupid.

235
00:22:22,607 --> 00:22:24,268
Dc-I look like him now?

236
00:22:24,343 --> 00:22:27,801
They think they're so cool
'cause they have those boxes.

237
00:22:27,879 --> 00:22:30,439
I like your lunch box.
Look at that.

238
00:22:32,050 --> 00:22:34,780
I don't know.
I think yours is much cooler.

239
00:22:34,853 --> 00:22:38,983
Let's see.
What do we have in here? Aha.

240
00:22:39,925 --> 00:22:42,086
- Look at that.
- Wow.

241
00:22:42,160 --> 00:22:45,391
Now you can get any kind of
lunch box you want.

242
00:22:45,464 --> 00:22:46,761
But it's our secret, okay?

243
00:22:48,734 --> 00:22:51,567
- Have fun picking out your box.
- Okay.

244
00:22:51,636 --> 00:22:53,035
Bye-bye.

245
00:22:56,108 --> 00:22:58,269
- Thank you very much for your time.
- Thank you.

246
00:22:58,343 --> 00:23:00,072
- Thank you for coming.
- We'll see you again.

247
00:23:00,145 --> 00:23:04,514
- Okay.
- Bye. That was really nice of you.

248
00:23:04,583 --> 00:23:08,212
Yeah, I'm really great
with drunks and kids.

249
00:23:08,286 --> 00:23:10,652
Instant gratification, you know?

250
00:23:14,092 --> 00:23:15,889
I'll see you tonight.

251
00:23:29,040 --> 00:23:30,974
Have a good day.

252
00:23:33,779 --> 00:23:35,610
- Hey, Artie.
- Hey, Joanie-

253
00:23:35,680 --> 00:23:36,977
Where you been hidin'?

254
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:39,209
Can you give me
some background information...

255
00:23:39,284 --> 00:23:41,445
on some of the students
that attend Colby?

256
00:23:41,520 --> 00:23:44,546
Didn't anybody ever explain to you
the way things work in this town?

257
00:23:44,623 --> 00:23:49,060
Which derives 80% of its jobs and 90%
of its revenue from this university.

258
00:23:49,127 --> 00:23:53,564
Where, on occasion, the police are
asked to conduct a discreet inquiry...

259
00:23:53,632 --> 00:23:58,399
they don't disrupt students' lives,
privacy, interrupt their studies...

260
00:23:58,470 --> 00:24:00,165
or, as a matter of fact,
talk to them at all...

261
00:24:00,238 --> 00:24:02,798
except at mutually agreed-upon
convenient times...

262
00:24:02,874 --> 00:24:06,742
until it can be conclusively proven
that a crime has been committed.

263
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:09,713
Which you haven't,
you can't, you won't.

264
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:44,571
Why do you always have to be
the center of attention?

265
00:24:45,383 --> 00:24:48,443
Drunk. Butterfly.

266
00:24:50,589 --> 00:24:53,285
Let's just hang out.

267
00:24:53,358 --> 00:24:55,121
Do butterflies drink?

268
00:24:56,962 --> 00:24:59,897
Let's just bail
on Josh's tonight, okay?

269
00:24:59,965 --> 00:25:01,557
How come?

270
00:25:01,633 --> 00:25:05,433
'Cause I don't want to sit around
and get wasted and stupid.

271
00:25:05,504 --> 00:25:08,132
Oh, okay, Captain America.

272
00:25:10,842 --> 00:25:13,140
Are your parents coming down
for your scrimmage on Saturday?

273
00:25:13,211 --> 00:25:15,975
- 'Course.
- What's their deal anyway?

274
00:25:16,047 --> 00:25:18,641
They come down for everything.

275
00:25:18,717 --> 00:25:21,242
- They do.
- That's what parents do.

276
00:25:21,319 --> 00:25:24,220
Oh, so that's what parents do, huh?

277
00:25:30,262 --> 00:25:32,560
I have to tell you something.

278
00:25:32,631 --> 00:25:34,223
What?

279
00:25:35,367 --> 00:25:37,062
Oh, man,
you're gonna be so pissed.

280
00:25:37,135 --> 00:25:38,830
What?

281
00:25:41,406 --> 00:25:46,503
I got accepted into an international law
program at the University of Minnesota.

282
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,508
You can't be serious.

283
00:25:59,157 --> 00:26:01,016
Sorry, honey. I can't do it.

284
00:26:01,092 --> 00:26:03,458
Daddy, I've been working hard.
I've been getting my grades up.

285
00:26:03,528 --> 00:26:06,759
My friend Alicia's been
helping me out with all the-

286
00:26:06,831 --> 00:26:09,322
I'm really sorry, honey.
I'll make it up to you.

287
00:26:09,401 --> 00:26:12,598
- Daddy, phase.
- We?! talk later. I got to go.

288
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,644
I was just going
to drop off my notes.

289
00:26:29,688 --> 00:26:31,815
- Happy birthday.
- Thanks.

290
00:26:33,592 --> 00:26:35,526
What's that smell?

291
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:40,762
- Lunch.
- You're cooking?

292
00:26:40,832 --> 00:26:43,801
Yeah, but don't shatter
your image of me too quickly.

293
00:26:43,868 --> 00:26:46,632
I only do it for my father,
so he can get that nice...

294
00:26:46,705 --> 00:26:49,503
homey feeling
before he stands me up.

295
00:26:49,574 --> 00:26:51,633
Let's celebrate.

296
00:27:01,286 --> 00:27:03,413
Oh, yeah, baby.

297
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:05,817
Yeah. Shake it!

298
00:27:27,145 --> 00:27:28,669
You are such a freak.

299
00:27:32,917 --> 00:27:35,078
What's this?

300
00:27:35,153 --> 00:27:37,053
- It says “Hadley?
- Open it.

301
00:27:37,122 --> 00:27:38,714
Okay.

302
00:27:38,790 --> 00:27:40,451
Watch the drink.

303
00:27:44,996 --> 00:27:47,396
“Round trip to Rangoon. “

304
00:27:55,607 --> 00:27:58,838
- Fucking Sidney.
- What does it mean?

305
00:27:58,910 --> 00:28:00,275
It means we're tripping.

306
00:28:02,147 --> 00:28:04,809
But I just held it for a second.

307
00:28:05,717 --> 00:28:07,981
It absorbs through your skin.

308
00:28:15,026 --> 00:28:17,586
But I just held it for one second.

309
00:28:22,300 --> 00:28:24,234
Do I look funny to you?

310
00:28:25,737 --> 00:28:27,932
Come on. just go with it.
It's okay.

311
00:28:38,483 --> 00:28:40,144
- I can go with it.
- Okay.

312
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:46,490
- Thank you.
- You're welcome.

313
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:50,494
This is never, ever,
ever going to be over.

314
00:28:50,562 --> 00:28:52,792
And I have nothing.

315
00:28:52,864 --> 00:28:54,957
It's going to be over.
I promise.

316
00:28:55,033 --> 00:28:58,491
And until it is,
I'll be right here.

317
00:28:58,570 --> 00:29:02,631
Promise me that you're never, ever,
ever going to leave me.

318
00:29:02,707 --> 00:29:07,007
I'm right here, okay?
Now I want you to think happy thoughts.

319
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:10,445
Oh, my God.
I'm gonna die.

320
00:29:10,515 --> 00:29:15,543
You're not gonna die. I'm here with you,
and I won't let anything happen.

321
00:29:15,620 --> 00:29:19,420
- You're gonna die too.
- No, I'm not. I'm not gonna die.

322
00:29:19,491 --> 00:29:21,322
No one's going to die.

323
00:29:48,787 --> 00:29:52,382
Hey, Sarah.
How you doin'?

324
00:29:52,457 --> 00:29:54,084
I've been better.

325
00:29:54,159 --> 00:29:57,094
Now, Alicia-
She's your best friend, right?

326
00:29:58,363 --> 00:29:59,990
Was.

327
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:03,991
We basically started to drift.

328
00:30:04,068 --> 00:30:08,232
Everything was fine until she got the
news her financial aid was turned down.

329
00:30:08,306 --> 00:30:12,675
- Hi, Mrs. Campbell.
- Hi, stranger. How you doin'?

330
00:30:12,744 --> 00:30:15,235
- Alicia upstairs?
- Yeah, she's up there.

331
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:21,480
I went to see her that day,
and she totally had a meltdown.

332
00:30:53,384 --> 00:30:56,717
After that day,
we barely saw each other.

333
00:30:56,788 --> 00:31:00,451
She was too busy reinventing herself
with her new rich friends.

334
00:31:00,525 --> 00:31:03,517
- What do you think it means?
- What did you do to her?

335
00:31:03,595 --> 00:31:05,756
- Alicia!
- Hey!

336
00:31:05,830 --> 00:31:08,458
- So, I guess you forgot about Sunday?
- Sunday-

337
00:31:08,533 --> 00:31:12,435
- The movie?
- Oh, God. I forgot. I'm so sorry.

338
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:14,801
Do you even want
to be friends anymore?

339
00:31:14,873 --> 00:31:17,467
What are you talking about?
We've been friends since kindergarten.

340
00:31:17,542 --> 00:31:20,170
You don't act like it.
We barely see each other.

341
00:31:20,245 --> 00:31:21,507
All you do
is hang out with them.

342
00:31:21,579 --> 00:31:24,980
It's just you don't know them,
and it's hard.

343
00:31:25,049 --> 00:31:27,745
- You never invite me.
- Because you wouldn't like it.

344
00:31:27,819 --> 00:31:29,184
Oh, right.
I see.

345
00:31:29,254 --> 00:31:31,347
I guess it's because I don't do
the right amount of heroin...

346
00:31:31,422 --> 00:31:34,619
or sleep with my professors
or get enough abortions, right?

347
00:31:34,692 --> 00:31:36,557
Is that what they're saying
about us this week?

348
00:31:36,628 --> 00:31:40,758
I can't believe you.
You've totally changed.

349
00:31:40,832 --> 00:31:43,528
No, I haven't changed.
I'm just really happy.

350
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:45,034
What about me?

351
00:31:47,005 --> 00:31:50,600
- So, are you coming?
- Yeah, I'll be right there.

352
00:31:50,675 --> 00:31:53,667
Listen, don't ruin this
for me, okay?

353
00:31:55,413 --> 00:31:58,644
I know what I'm doing.
This is a great opportunity.

354
00:31:58,716 --> 00:32:00,308
Trust me.

355
00:32:09,994 --> 00:32:12,758
That's when she really
stopped being my friend.

356
00:32:22,640 --> 00:32:24,335
Right side! Cover it!

357
00:32:32,951 --> 00:32:35,647
Excuse me, Trevor.
I need to ask you a few questions.

358
00:32:37,422 --> 00:32:40,152
You're prelaw, right?
Like Alicia?

359
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,851
Yeah.

360
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,656
I'm just a little curious
about y'all's relationship.

361
00:32:46,331 --> 00:32:49,027
We're friends.
She's cool.

362
00:32:49,100 --> 00:32:51,091
Is that how she felt?

363
00:32:53,404 --> 00:32:55,065
Meaning?

364
00:32:55,139 --> 00:32:59,940
Meaning is it possible that she could
have thought a little bit more of you?

365
00:33:00,011 --> 00:33:01,740
Just a little bit.

366
00:33:05,450 --> 00:33:07,975
Alicia liked to have a good time.

367
00:33:08,052 --> 00:33:10,111
We liked to hang out.

368
00:33:10,188 --> 00:33:12,349
Nothing wrong with that, is there?

369
00:33:49,427 --> 00:33:52,828
I wasn't trying to ignore you. You've
just been so busy playing hostess.

370
00:33:52,897 --> 00:33:55,024
I'm surprised you even noticed.

371
00:33:58,036 --> 00:34:02,803
You and Alicia seem to be
getting along very well.

372
00:34:02,874 --> 00:34:06,435
You act like I don't even exist,
flirt with every breathing guy.

373
00:34:06,511 --> 00:34:08,308
And I dance with one girl,
a friend of yours.

374
00:34:08,379 --> 00:34:10,870
I'm not the bad guy here. Okay?

375
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:13,439
I'm not the one who's drooling
all over Little Miss Muffett.

376
00:34:13,518 --> 00:34:15,486
Well, if that's what it takes
to get your attention.

377
00:34:15,553 --> 00:34:20,547
- Don't turn this around on me.
- Turn what around?

378
00:34:20,625 --> 00:34:22,115
You know what?

379
00:34:22,193 --> 00:34:25,128
Do whatever you want.
Go fuck her for all I care.

380
00:34:30,935 --> 00:34:34,063
I tried explaining to her that
we were just having a little fun.

381
00:34:34,138 --> 00:34:37,130
I mean, it's nothing
to get weird about.

382
00:34:40,711 --> 00:34:45,375
Alicia was new to the gang,
and she wanted to fit in.

383
00:34:45,450 --> 00:34:47,441
I helped her whenever I could.

384
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,653
All the best girls in town

385
00:34:50,721 --> 00:34:53,019
Every time I see you
you have a little frown

386
00:34:56,427 --> 00:34:59,828
Go Warren, Warren, Warren
Warren, you scorin'

387
00:34:59,897 --> 00:35:01,364
With all the chickies

388
00:35:01,432 --> 00:35:05,960
I see that big thing
is a hickey on your neck

389
00:35:06,037 --> 00:35:08,631
When I stare at you
you're laughin' at me

390
00:35:08,706 --> 00:35:11,368
You're laughing at me
that's okay because I'm free

391
00:35:11,442 --> 00:35:14,138
Some call me
the trick-a-dick daddy

392
00:35:18,883 --> 00:35:20,475
What's wrong?

393
00:35:22,453 --> 00:35:23,613
Nothin'.

394
00:35:23,688 --> 00:35:26,680
Warren Z's on, he's on the mike
tryin' to ride my bike

395
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:29,658
- God. MC Hammer!
- MC Hammer, MC Hammer

396
00:35:29,727 --> 00:35:31,627
That's me
because I'm so “hammerin”

397
00:35:33,865 --> 00:35:36,891
I'm glad I found you, 'cause...

398
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:40,927
I'm feeling
kind of out of place tonight.

399
00:35:41,005 --> 00:35:42,472
Really?

400
00:35:44,242 --> 00:35:47,177
- Me too.
- Yeah?

401
00:35:47,245 --> 00:35:48,371
Yeah.

402
00:35:51,582 --> 00:35:53,345
You really love Hadley,
don't you?

403
00:35:54,452 --> 00:35:55,749
Yeah.

404
00:35:58,789 --> 00:36:01,553
I suddenly feel like
I shouldn't be here anymore.

405
00:36:05,663 --> 00:36:08,655
- Why?
- Oh, come on, Trevor.

406
00:36:10,268 --> 00:36:14,364
I think you fit in just fine.

407
00:36:14,438 --> 00:36:17,771
- Good spit.
- I think you're really great.

408
00:36:21,979 --> 00:36:26,609
- So that's as far as it went?
- That's as far as it ever went.

409
00:36:26,684 --> 00:36:30,120
Well, then why is Alicia
lyin' in a hospital bed?

410
00:36:32,290 --> 00:36:34,781
Sometimes bad things happen
to good people.

411
00:37:14,131 --> 00:37:17,328
So the bartender says,
“We got a drink named after you. ”

412
00:37:23,774 --> 00:37:27,073
And the grasshopper says,
“What, you got a drink named Steve?“

413
00:37:38,222 --> 00:37:42,556
Oh, God! I'm so sorry.
Can I have what she's having?

414
00:37:42,627 --> 00:37:46,927
- Trevor is so, so smart.
- Yeah, he's perfect.

415
00:37:46,998 --> 00:37:51,560
- Are you okay?
- He thinks I'm a drunk.

416
00:37:51,636 --> 00:37:54,230
He's totally crazy about you.

417
00:37:54,305 --> 00:37:57,502
Yeah, for a person
with a severe drinking problem.

418
00:37:59,877 --> 00:38:03,142
You're a smart, beautiful girl
who really doesn't believe in herself.

419
00:38:05,750 --> 00:38:09,277
Why should I?
My dad doesn't. Trevor doesn't.

420
00:38:09,353 --> 00:38:11,378
I do.

421
00:38:13,557 --> 00:38:16,424
I know you like him.

422
00:38:16,494 --> 00:38:18,394
Well, everybody likes Trevor.

423
00:38:20,231 --> 00:38:23,894
I know that you think we're all wild
and everything and that everything goes.

424
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:26,198
But we don't fuck
each other's boyfriends. Okay?

425
00:38:27,972 --> 00:38:30,805
Look, Hadley.
I've never been in this place before.

426
00:38:30,875 --> 00:38:33,639
Now, all of a sudden, all these guys
are dancing with me who a month ago...

427
00:38:33,711 --> 00:38:35,235
never knew I existed.

428
00:38:36,147 --> 00:38:40,516
I owe all this to you. I would never do
anything to jeopardize our friendship.

429
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:43,185
Okay?

430
00:38:46,324 --> 00:38:48,087
Come here.
Gimme a hug.

431
00:38:50,828 --> 00:38:53,296
Come on.
Come and dance and have fun.

432
00:38:53,364 --> 00:38:55,730
Come on. Come on. Come on.
Come and dance.

433
00:39:07,812 --> 00:39:09,837
Sorry it took so long.

434
00:39:12,650 --> 00:39:15,380
- All right. All right.
- Basic party mix.

435
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:18,650
20% coke; 80% milk, sugar,
baking soda, talcum powder...

436
00:39:18,723 --> 00:39:20,782
and assorted
powdery-white crapola.

437
00:39:20,858 --> 00:39:24,885
- Nothing out of the ordinary?
- Not in the least.

438
00:39:24,962 --> 00:39:26,293
Except...

439
00:39:26,364 --> 00:39:28,832
that's not what she took.

440
00:39:28,899 --> 00:39:31,834
When they wheeled her in, she still
had some crusted on her nostrils.

441
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,802
They took a swab of that.

442
00:39:33,871 --> 00:39:37,466
Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.

443
00:39:39,877 --> 00:39:41,310
All right. Thanks, Dex.

444
00:39:44,215 --> 00:39:48,549
What the fuck is your problem?
You want credit, call a loan officer.

445
00:39:48,619 --> 00:39:52,316
Hold on. Hold on.
Hold, please!

446
00:39:52,390 --> 00:39:55,621
Yeah. Yeah.

447
00:39:55,693 --> 00:39:59,220
We got some Colombian,
Jamaican, Thai...

448
00:39:59,296 --> 00:40:01,856
northern lights with a
skunk-five hybrid, hash, hash oil.

449
00:40:01,932 --> 00:40:04,423
Think about that for one minute.
Hold, please.

450
00:40:06,404 --> 00:40:08,429
- It's not mine.
- I need to ask you some questions.

451
00:40:10,541 --> 00:40:14,170
- Multicolored paper, Max.
- I like to brighten up people's lives.

452
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,304
Did you brighten up
Alicia Campbell's life?

453
00:40:16,380 --> 00:40:19,178
- I don't know anything about-
- Who gave her pharmaceutical cocaine?

454
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,810
- What are you talking about?
- Come on now, Max.

455
00:40:21,886 --> 00:40:23,854
That shit was 100% pure.

456
00:40:23,921 --> 00:40:27,357
If she didn't get it from a drug dealer,
then who the fuck did she get it from?

457
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:31,361
Ask anybody. I sell a very low-quality
product at a very premium price.

458
00:40:37,601 --> 00:40:41,037
All right. Now you get to spend some
quality time with some premium people.

459
00:40:55,553 --> 00:40:59,649
Lead, follow or get out of the way.

460
00:41:03,294 --> 00:41:05,728
- I'll be back later.
- Alicia, honey.

461
00:41:07,398 --> 00:41:10,367
Don't you have to study?

462
00:41:10,434 --> 00:41:12,368
What's the point?

463
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:04,876
Hey, it's Hadley.

464
00:43:04,949 --> 00:43:07,679
Leave me a message,
and I'll get back to you. Thanks.

465
00:43:24,868 --> 00:43:28,304
Hey, Chief.
Something I can do for you?

466
00:43:28,372 --> 00:43:32,934
I have to ask you a few questions, but
could I use your bathroom first, please?

467
00:43:33,010 --> 00:43:34,375
Sure.

468
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,080
Why don't you use the bathroom
at the top of the stairs.

469
00:43:41,118 --> 00:43:43,916
I'll be right down.
just give me a minute.

470
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:13,477
You can't do that.
What are you looking for, anyway?

471
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:17,418
Alicia overdosed on
pharmaceutical cocaine.

472
00:44:17,488 --> 00:44:19,854
I need to know where it came from.

473
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:25,593
- I think you better go.
- Can I talk to you for a few minutes?

474
00:44:26,930 --> 00:44:29,694
Don't you need to get
a warrant or something?

475
00:44:29,767 --> 00:44:33,362
- Yeah. Yeah. All right.
- Where would we even get that shit?

476
00:44:33,437 --> 00:44:36,406
- That's what I'm saying. I don't know.
- And I do?

477
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:40,432
You think that Alicia's just this
innocent little virgin we corrupted.

478
00:44:41,779 --> 00:44:44,543
She's nothing like she seems.

479
00:44:44,615 --> 00:44:48,278
Believe me, that girl
was full of surprises.

480
00:44:54,358 --> 00:44:57,225
Is-
Hadley's not here. Okay.

481
00:44:57,294 --> 00:45:01,253
She and] Jules went to get stuff for
the party, but you can hang out with me.

482
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,060
Okay.

483
00:45:03,133 --> 00:45:04,464
Come sit.

484
00:45:07,871 --> 00:45:11,238
Oh, my God.
You're watching Fame.

485
00:45:11,308 --> 00:45:16,075
I totally think that all America needs
is, like, this giant Fame resurgence-

486
00:45:16,146 --> 00:45:19,980
- How many guys have you slept with?
- What?

487
00:45:20,050 --> 00:45:22,143
How many guys
have you slept with?

488
00:45:23,854 --> 00:45:26,322
Well- One.

489
00:45:26,390 --> 00:45:29,621
I mean, sort of.
Well, half of one.

490
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:31,593
Because when we actually did it...

491
00:45:31,662 --> 00:45:33,755
his thing only went in that far.

492
00:45:33,831 --> 00:45:38,495
And afterwards, Sarah said,
“You're a technical virgin. “

493
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:40,628
Why? How many guys
have you slept with?

494
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:48,305
- Forty-two.
- Are you serious?

495
00:45:49,646 --> 00:45:52,274
Daddy number two crawled in
one night when I was ten.

496
00:45:52,349 --> 00:45:55,944
Not the ideal way to lose your
virginity, but, hey, shit happens.

497
00:45:56,019 --> 00:45:58,419
- He molested you?
- Yeah, well, poor me.

498
00:45:58,489 --> 00:46:00,286
Guess that's why
I'm so fucked up. Right?

499
00:46:04,194 --> 00:46:06,628
My dad did that to me too.

500
00:46:08,565 --> 00:46:10,328
But I think-

501
00:46:12,302 --> 00:46:15,294
Well, I know that you're
a smart and beautiful girl.

502
00:46:29,686 --> 00:46:31,813
See, that wasn't so bad.
Was it?

503
00:47:16,934 --> 00:47:18,868
Take off your pants.

504
00:47:28,145 --> 00:47:30,204
So, then, you two were a thing?

505
00:47:30,280 --> 00:47:34,944
Well, that's what I thought. But little
miss pisshead had plans of her own.

506
00:47:37,721 --> 00:47:40,417
Trevor, give me a hand
with this, will you?

507
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:58,607
They're gonna
be here soon. Hurry.

508
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:01,769
I am.
Oh,Jesus Christ!

509
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:05,076
Oh, heart attack.

510
00:48:05,148 --> 00:48:06,911
We were supposed
to work today, remember?

511
00:48:09,620 --> 00:48:12,316
But if now's not a good time,
then I can come back later.

512
00:48:12,389 --> 00:48:15,085
No, no, no. Stay.
Hang out for a while.

513
00:48:15,158 --> 00:48:16,921
Okay.

514
00:48:52,763 --> 00:48:56,426
- Alicia looks pretty hot tonight.
- Why don't you go dance with her?

515
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:59,367
So you can slink over
and start dyking it up with her?

516
00:48:59,436 --> 00:49:01,631
I already have.

517
00:49:01,705 --> 00:49:03,764
What?

518
00:49:03,840 --> 00:49:06,331
When?

519
00:49:06,410 --> 00:49:09,004
- Right now.
- You bad girl.

520
00:49:17,054 --> 00:49:20,387
Jesus. What,
is everyone a lesbian now?

521
00:49:25,562 --> 00:49:28,122
Oh, back for more.

522
00:49:28,198 --> 00:49:29,893
Can you control your girlfriend?

523
00:49:36,673 --> 00:49:38,698
The party's over here.

524
00:49:57,027 --> 00:49:58,961
This should be good.

525
00:50:03,867 --> 00:50:06,859
- I thought we had a deal, Alicia.
- I was just having fun.

526
00:50:06,937 --> 00:50:10,100
A little too much fun.
We're going back to school tomorrow.

527
00:50:10,173 --> 00:50:13,540
It's not due until May.
We don't have to do it tomorrow.

528
00:50:13,610 --> 00:50:16,272
Besides, I'm gonna be
completely hung over.

529
00:50:16,346 --> 00:50:21,613
If I blew something off every time I was
hung over, I'd still be in third grade.

530
00:50:21,685 --> 00:50:25,246
Hadley, you just have to, like...

531
00:50:25,322 --> 00:50:27,586
just calm down.

532
00:50:27,657 --> 00:50:29,454
I am calm.
It's just-

533
00:50:29,526 --> 00:50:31,960
- What?
- It's not cool, okay?

534
00:50:32,029 --> 00:50:33,758
If you want to stay up
all night partying, fine.

535
00:50:33,830 --> 00:50:35,525
But you're getting crazy.
You're not balancing.

536
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,410
Don't touch me.

537
00:50:58,488 --> 00:51:00,479
Sid, hey, don't touch me.

538
00:51:02,225 --> 00:51:04,090
Fuck you.

539
00:51:04,161 --> 00:51:06,425
Listen, I'm not into
this thing with us.

540
00:51:06,496 --> 00:51:09,192
Oh, really?
You could've fooled me.

541
00:51:09,266 --> 00:51:10,995
Why don't you go find Trevor?

542
00:51:11,068 --> 00:51:14,595
I'm sure he's missed having to
fight you off the last five minutes.

543
00:51:14,671 --> 00:51:16,639
Just leave me alone, okay?

544
00:51:19,476 --> 00:51:20,704
So you were upset.

545
00:51:22,546 --> 00:51:24,446
Why would I be upset?

546
00:51:24,514 --> 00:51:27,483
- I don't know. You tell me.
- Tell you what?

547
00:51:27,551 --> 00:51:29,815
About you and Alicia.

548
00:51:33,723 --> 00:51:36,055
You would never understand.

549
00:51:37,394 --> 00:51:39,624
Why? 'Cause I'm a cop?

550
00:51:39,696 --> 00:51:41,789
Because you're a guy.

551
00:51:58,315 --> 00:52:01,148
This is how you're
leaving my students alone?

552
00:52:01,218 --> 00:52:03,413
- By sexually harassing them?
- What?

553
00:52:03,487 --> 00:52:06,581
I know all about your
little panty raid at the girls' house.

554
00:52:07,457 --> 00:52:09,948
Goddamn it!
I did not touch those girls.

555
00:52:10,026 --> 00:52:12,153
Possibly I didn't
make it clear to you...

556
00:52:12,229 --> 00:52:14,129
how things work around here.

557
00:52:14,197 --> 00:52:16,757
You made it clear,
but I am investigating a crime.

558
00:52:16,833 --> 00:52:17,800
An accident.

559
00:52:17,868 --> 00:52:20,462
Slipping somebody pharmaceutical
cocaine and attempted murder-

560
00:52:20,537 --> 00:52:23,506
those are not accidents, sir.

561
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:27,532
Maybe it's time that
I asked the town council...

562
00:52:27,611 --> 00:52:32,310
to start interviewing other candidates
for the position of sheriff.

563
00:53:02,179 --> 00:53:05,376
- How you doin', Joanie?
- Hey.

564
00:53:05,448 --> 00:53:06,608
All right.

565
00:53:06,683 --> 00:53:09,117
- I appreciate this.
- Anytime.

566
00:53:48,758 --> 00:53:50,589
You think I'm a freak?

567
00:54:03,573 --> 00:54:04,699
I did that...

568
00:54:06,476 --> 00:54:09,036
for five years.

569
00:54:10,380 --> 00:54:13,611
Until all these white bumps...

570
00:54:13,683 --> 00:54:16,208
grew all over my face and body.

571
00:54:18,955 --> 00:54:21,219
And when you're ready,
I can help you stop.

572
00:54:23,126 --> 00:54:25,993
No one can help me.

573
00:54:26,062 --> 00:54:29,657
Every time I do it,
I think it's gonna be the last.

574
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:32,759
It never is.

575
00:54:32,836 --> 00:54:36,272
I'm just a big fat loser.

576
00:54:38,808 --> 00:54:40,173
Fat.

577
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:51,345
You're beautiful,
and you're smart.

578
00:54:53,657 --> 00:54:55,557
And your dad...

579
00:54:55,625 --> 00:54:58,992
probably said you were fat...

580
00:54:59,062 --> 00:55:01,257
just like mine did.

581
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:17,445
I'm gonna get
straight to the point.

582
00:55:17,514 --> 00:55:20,711
The stuff Alicia was doing
you can only get with a prescription.

583
00:55:20,784 --> 00:55:24,413
And my father just happens
to be a pharmacist.

584
00:55:24,487 --> 00:55:26,955
Hey, Dad, we're having
a coke party tonight...

585
00:55:27,023 --> 00:55:29,423
and I really wanna fry
one of my friends.

586
00:55:29,492 --> 00:55:32,359
Really, Pop?
You're the best.

587
00:55:32,429 --> 00:55:35,660
You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fuckin' liar.

588
00:55:36,533 --> 00:55:39,832
We were getting tired
of keeping track of her.

589
00:55:39,903 --> 00:55:42,736
- You won't believe what just happened.
- Want to celebrate?

590
00:55:42,806 --> 00:55:45,240
- I don't know.
- Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous.

591
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:48,072
- It seems like an awful lot.
- Max's shit...

592
00:55:48,144 --> 00:55:50,942
you have to do a whole gram
in each nostril to even get a buzz.

593
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:52,641
We are celebrating here,
aren't we?

594
00:55:52,716 --> 00:55:55,879
We most certainly are.

595
00:55:55,952 --> 00:55:58,614
Here she goes.

596
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:12,328
Hello. Oh, yeah,
she's right here. Hold on.

597
00:56:12,402 --> 00:56:14,700
- Alicia, here.
- Hello?

598
00:56:14,771 --> 00:56:17,604
Hi! How are you?
I'm fine. Okay.

599
00:56:17,674 --> 00:56:22,111
No. Oh, my God.
I am so beyond excited.

600
00:56:22,178 --> 00:56:23,839
Yes! Totally excited.

601
00:56:23,913 --> 00:56:27,110
Thank you so much.
All right.

602
00:56:27,183 --> 00:56:28,946
I'll see you later.
Bye.

603
00:56:30,687 --> 00:56:32,279
Hey, what's up, Alicia?

604
00:56:35,024 --> 00:56:37,356
Then she took off again.

605
00:56:37,427 --> 00:56:40,453
So you don't know who it was
or what it was about?

606
00:56:40,530 --> 00:56:42,498
Just that it was a guy.

607
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,499
Didn't sound like anyone I knew.

608
00:56:44,567 --> 00:56:47,661
But after she talked to him,
she disappeared for a few days.

609
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:50,968
That last night, she shows up
at our party totally wasted.

610
00:57:14,197 --> 00:57:16,825
Hey, you guys.
Look.

611
00:57:22,972 --> 00:57:25,065
What a tart.

612
00:57:25,141 --> 00:57:27,075
I'm going to help Hads.

613
00:57:44,494 --> 00:57:45,825
Hold this.

614
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:51,130
Oh, shit.

615
00:58:21,464 --> 00:58:24,194
I don't know.
You think we should tell Jules?

616
00:58:24,267 --> 00:58:26,963
Not until we got something to tell.

617
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:29,129
Let's go.

618
00:58:34,911 --> 00:58:37,903
- She's not worth it.
- How am I gonna have fun with her here?

619
00:58:37,981 --> 00:58:39,209
Hey!

620
00:58:39,282 --> 00:58:42,979
Oh, Mes. guess what we 'just-

621
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,753
She is so unbelievable.

622
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:49,291
- I knew she-
- Whatever.

623
00:58:53,596 --> 00:58:56,565
Alicia, I'm not really
comfortable with this.

624
00:58:56,633 --> 00:58:59,466
Here, let me make it
easy on you.

625
00:58:59,536 --> 00:59:02,562
Hadley slept
with Warren, you know.

626
00:59:02,639 --> 00:59:04,573
- Really?
- Yeah.

627
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:19,287
All your bullshit about Alicia and me,
and you fucked Warren?

628
00:59:21,691 --> 00:59:24,421
Come on. Let's talk
about this alone, okay?

629
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:27,725
No, not if you were
the last person on earth.

630
00:59:33,336 --> 00:59:35,167
Should've told him.

631
00:59:46,449 --> 00:59:48,542
Where's Alicia?

632
01:00:12,809 --> 01:00:15,710
All that time, we thought
it was Trevor she was after...

633
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,042
but apparently
she had her eye on Warren.

634
01:00:18,114 --> 01:00:19,376
And you forgave her for that?

635
01:00:19,449 --> 01:00:22,247
No. As a matter of fact,
I didn't.

636
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,752
Well, you realize that's a motive.

637
01:00:24,821 --> 01:00:26,345
Really?

638
01:00:26,422 --> 01:00:29,687
Then why didn't I try to kill Hadley?
She fucked him too.

639
01:00:31,461 --> 01:00:34,328
I mean, if I went after
every girl Warren fucked...

640
01:00:34,397 --> 01:00:37,161
you'd have a campus
littered with dead bodies.

641
01:01:09,432 --> 01:01:12,094
You usually get a lot
of college kids in here?

642
01:01:12,168 --> 01:01:14,102
Are you kidding?
The way these kids drink...

643
01:01:14,170 --> 01:01:17,162
I'm making a fortune
just off the fucking tips.

644
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:21,040
But we ca rd everybody.
They got to have two pieces of I.D.

645
01:01:21,110 --> 01:01:23,908
I don't serve underage in here.

646
01:01:23,980 --> 01:01:26,813
Did you hear what happened
to Alicia Campbell?

647
01:01:26,883 --> 01:01:29,852
Yeah. She was in here
a couple of nights before it happened.

648
01:01:29,919 --> 01:01:33,480
I threw her out. She and this blond
chick were having a pier six brawl.

649
01:01:33,556 --> 01:01:37,959
Blond chick? She's about 5'6“,
splint on her arm?

650
01:01:38,027 --> 01:01:39,654
Yeah, that sounds about right.

651
01:01:39,729 --> 01:01:42,095
- Do you know why they were fighting?
- It sounded like a guy.

652
01:01:48,571 --> 01:01:49,970
Take it outside!
Outside!

653
01:01:53,176 --> 01:01:55,144
You don't remember what
they were fighting about?

654
01:01:55,211 --> 01:01:57,679
You remember hearing any names?
Warren? Trevor?

655
01:01:57,747 --> 01:02:00,341
No. I told you,
just some guy.

656
01:02:02,618 --> 01:02:03,642
All right.

657
01:02:03,720 --> 01:02:06,018
All people are affected by
their external circumstances...

658
01:02:06,089 --> 01:02:08,751
and one uses the gifts
one is given...

659
01:02:08,825 --> 01:02:12,784
to bargain and negotiate
for a place in society.

660
01:02:12,862 --> 01:02:16,559
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?

661
01:02:17,967 --> 01:02:19,525
Was that okay, Warren?

662
01:02:20,737 --> 01:02:22,364
Was that okay?

663
01:02:22,438 --> 01:02:23,666
To blend in and follow.

664
01:02:23,740 --> 01:02:27,471
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?

665
01:02:27,543 --> 01:02:31,639
- Should I do that again?
- This ain't really your style, is it?

666
01:02:31,714 --> 01:02:33,272
You go to school,
and every once in a while...

667
01:02:33,349 --> 01:02:35,544
they actually want you
to hand something in.

668
01:02:36,753 --> 01:02:39,620
“Lead, Follow,
or Get Out of the Way:

669
01:02:39,689 --> 01:02:42,453
A Sociological Examination
of Poor Children...

670
01:02:42,525 --> 01:02:45,289
Placed in a Privileged
Educational Environment...

671
01:02:45,361 --> 01:02:50,060
and Rich Kids Thrust
into the Deprived Students' World. “

672
01:02:50,133 --> 01:02:52,124
After an initial period
of rebellion...

673
01:02:52,201 --> 01:02:56,001
the poor student discovers his success
in the rich kids' environment...

674
01:02:56,072 --> 01:03:00,236
comes from his ability
to blend in, to follow.

675
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:02,243
The old man
who lived in the old house...

676
01:03:02,311 --> 01:03:04,336
he jumped on his house
and knocked it down.

677
01:03:04,413 --> 01:03:07,314
But what about the rest of the children,
the ones caught in the middle?

678
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:09,851
Like the middle class
they will grow up to be...

679
01:03:09,919 --> 01:03:12,319
they simply don't want
to get involved.

680
01:03:12,388 --> 01:03:14,652
They don't want to be bothered.

681
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:18,387
They're simply content
to get out of the way.

682
01:03:18,461 --> 01:03:20,486
I said it.

683
01:03:20,563 --> 01:03:23,259
Okay. Okay, I get it.

684
01:03:23,332 --> 01:03:25,960
So Alicia is
the poor kid, right...

685
01:03:26,035 --> 01:03:29,129
who was allowed to hang out,
play with rich kids.

686
01:03:29,205 --> 01:03:31,901
They didn't want her to lead.
She didn't want to follow.

687
01:03:31,974 --> 01:03:36,070
So someone had to get her
out of the way.

688
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:38,007
You need a vacation.

689
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:47,250
So how'd it feel, Warren, huh?

690
01:03:47,323 --> 01:03:51,089
Fucking Hadley- was it worth
all the problems that it caused?

691
01:03:51,160 --> 01:03:54,061
Are you kidding?
It let me fulfill a fantasy.

692
01:03:54,764 --> 01:03:59,133
Hadley got the best boning
of her life. Sid got to watch.

693
01:03:59,202 --> 01:04:02,296
- Where does Alicia fit into all this?
- She didn't...

694
01:04:02,371 --> 01:04:04,168
other than telling Jules
and Trevor about it.

695
01:04:05,641 --> 01:04:08,041
Why did Alicia tell...

696
01:04:08,110 --> 01:04:10,135
if Sidney was the one
who saw it?

697
01:04:10,213 --> 01:04:13,944
If I gave a shit and was willing to
think about it, I'd say it's because...

698
01:04:14,016 --> 01:04:16,382
Alicia had more to gain.

699
01:04:27,697 --> 01:04:30,325
You're really fucking paranoid.

700
01:04:30,399 --> 01:04:32,264
I'm paranoid?

701
01:04:32,335 --> 01:04:35,736
You're a smart and beautiful girl
who really doesn't believe in herself

702
01:04:36,572 --> 01:04:39,769
Hi, honey. I'm really sorry
about your birthday...

703
01:04:39,842 --> 01:04:42,310
but I'm having a meeting
in Atlanta tomorrow.

704
01:04:42,378 --> 01:04:44,846
I could come down early
and meet you for dinner tonight.

705
01:04:44,914 --> 01:04:47,940
Say, 7:30,
the Lawrence ville Inn.

706
01:04:48,017 --> 01:04:50,076
Bye-bye.

707
01:04:52,255 --> 01:04:54,314
Message deleted.

708
01:05:05,835 --> 01:05:09,566
- Hi. Mr. Ashton?
- Yes.

709
01:05:09,639 --> 01:05:12,767
I'm Alicia Campbell,
a friend of Hadley's.

710
01:05:12,842 --> 01:05:15,834
I'm so glad you could join us.
Where is Hadley?

711
01:05:15,912 --> 01:05:17,777
She's not coming.

712
01:05:17,847 --> 01:05:22,477
She's finishing up an interview
for our soc project, sir.

713
01:05:22,551 --> 01:05:26,544
- But I didn't give her your message.
- Excuse me?

714
01:05:26,622 --> 01:05:29,648
The discipline you've enforced
on her is working so well, sir.

715
01:05:29,725 --> 01:05:33,286
And because she's studying and she's
working hard and not drinking so much-

716
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:36,593
and I know it's not my place to get
involved, but if she saw you now...

717
01:05:36,666 --> 01:05:39,863
she would just lose
complete focus.

718
01:05:43,339 --> 01:05:44,363
Really.

719
01:05:50,780 --> 01:05:53,476
- Are you sure?
- I am, sir.

720
01:05:57,520 --> 01:05:58,987
Have a seat.

721
01:05:59,055 --> 01:06:01,819
Would you like a cocktail
or a glass of wine?

722
01:06:03,426 --> 01:06:05,860
I'll have...

723
01:06:07,129 --> 01:06:09,097
a club soda.

724
01:06:09,165 --> 01:06:11,395
Club soda.
I'll have another one.

725
01:06:14,737 --> 01:06:17,831
You know, you really might be
a good influence on her.

726
01:06:32,455 --> 01:06:35,288
You really might be
a good influence on her.

727
01:07:09,191 --> 01:07:11,284
Multicolored paper.

728
01:07:27,576 --> 01:07:30,340
You really might be
a good influence on her.

729
01:07:38,954 --> 01:07:41,184
Pressure!

730
01:07:41,257 --> 01:07:43,953
- It's falling. We're losing her.
- Please get out of here.

731
01:07:44,026 --> 01:07:47,757
Come on, come on.
You have to leave. Let's go.

732
01:07:49,665 --> 01:07:51,428
We got a flat line!
Asystolic!

733
01:07:51,500 --> 01:07:54,264
Code blue!

734
01:08:09,585 --> 01:08:14,079
We were able to stabilize her, and we'll
continue to watch her through the night.

735
01:08:14,156 --> 01:08:17,148
There's not much more we can do
right now, Mrs. Campbell.

736
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:20,195
You should go home
and get some rest.

737
01:08:37,346 --> 01:08:39,837
I'm sure you can understand
our position here.

738
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,907
This thing does have
to be investigated.

739
01:08:42,985 --> 01:08:45,180
Sensitively.

740
01:08:45,254 --> 01:08:47,654
Delicately.

741
01:08:47,723 --> 01:08:51,853
You think that Alicia's just this
little innocent virgin we corrupted.

742
01:08:51,927 --> 01:08:54,487
She's nothing like she seems.

743
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:09,741
You think Alicia's the Virgin Mary.
She's a fucking liar.

744
01:09:12,148 --> 01:09:15,174
When they wheeled her in, she still
had some crusted on her nostrils.

745
01:09:15,251 --> 01:09:17,116
They took a swab of that.

746
01:09:17,186 --> 01:09:20,781
Pharmaceutical quality.
100% pure.

747
01:09:26,795 --> 01:09:30,561
I'm just trying to figure out how Alicia
went from being a total stranger...

748
01:09:30,633 --> 01:09:32,533
to being your best friend...

749
01:09:32,601 --> 01:09:36,367
to now lying in the hospital
with tubes running in and out of her.

750
01:09:43,345 --> 01:09:46,109
Sometimes bad things
happen to good people.

751
01:09:54,957 --> 01:09:56,686
Sometimes
you gotta do what's right...

752
01:09:56,759 --> 01:09:58,727
'cause you can't not.

753
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:38,431
It may cost me my job, but there's
no way Alicia knew what she was taking.

754
01:10:38,500 --> 01:10:40,968
Come on now, man.
Do the right thing.

755
01:10:42,805 --> 01:10:46,241
All I know is there was some pretty
weird shit in the air that night.

756
01:10:46,308 --> 01:10:51,041
Hadley and I weren't getting along,
and I was sick of getting wasted.

757
01:10:51,113 --> 01:10:55,550
Nice spit to the beat box.
Nice spit to the beat box.

758
01:10:55,618 --> 01:10:58,382
I'm feeling really
out of place here tonight.

759
01:11:00,522 --> 01:11:02,786
I know.

760
01:11:02,858 --> 01:11:04,223
Me too.

761
01:11:07,396 --> 01:11:09,864
I had a lot of fun
dancing with you.

762
01:11:15,471 --> 01:11:17,496
- You just gotta be careful.
- What do you mean?

763
01:11:17,573 --> 01:11:20,565
You just have to be careful
and watch out.

764
01:11:20,643 --> 01:11:22,975
Stay sweet.

765
01:11:23,045 --> 01:11:26,572
See, Hadley didn't like it
if she wasn't the center of attention.

766
01:11:28,150 --> 01:11:30,983
Hey, Hadley.
You're not walking so good.

767
01:11:35,057 --> 01:11:37,582
Hey, Trevor.

768
01:11:37,660 --> 01:11:41,858
- Watch this.
- Where you goin'?

769
01:11:43,732 --> 01:11:45,529
- What are you doing?
- You're a nut.

770
01:11:45,601 --> 01:11:47,694
Miss Hadley.

771
01:11:49,338 --> 01:11:51,329
- Where are you going?
- Hadley!

772
01:11:59,782 --> 01:12:01,545
You've had a very severe
concussion.

773
01:12:01,617 --> 01:12:04,586
We'll have to keep you
to run some tests.

774
01:12:04,653 --> 01:12:06,746
No, I'm not staying here.

775
01:12:08,190 --> 01:12:09,623
Yes, you are.

776
01:12:18,767 --> 01:12:21,634
If there's anything I can do
for you while you're here...

777
01:12:21,704 --> 01:12:23,467
- give a holler.
- Is everything okay?

778
01:12:31,747 --> 01:12:33,681
That's all I know.

779
01:12:41,724 --> 01:12:44,056
All right. Look alive.
I'm gonna need this from you-

780
01:12:44,126 --> 01:12:45,991
an inventory from the hospital.

781
01:12:46,061 --> 01:12:49,292
Give me the name of the orderly that
was on duty the day Hadley was there.

782
01:12:49,365 --> 01:12:53,324
Petey, I'm gonna need
a lab test, search warrant.

783
01:12:56,772 --> 01:13:00,902
Thank you for joining us
in this candlelight vigil...

784
01:13:00,976 --> 01:13:02,671
in honor of our close friend...

785
01:13:02,745 --> 01:13:05,077
and fellow student...

786
01:13:05,147 --> 01:13:07,377
Alicia Campbell.

787
01:13:09,952 --> 01:13:14,013
As you all know,
Alicia had a setback last night...

788
01:13:14,089 --> 01:13:16,922
and needs
our hopes and prayers.

789
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:20,257
Please take a moment
to ask for her recovery...

790
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:24,265
so she can once again
return to us here at Colby.

791
01:13:40,315 --> 01:13:43,250
Hi, Artie.
Good to see you.

792
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,912
Hey, Rhoda...

793
01:13:45,988 --> 01:13:49,651
were you on call
the night Hadley was admitted?

794
01:13:49,725 --> 01:13:53,456
No, but I was there
the next day when Alicia came.

795
01:13:56,432 --> 01:13:58,366
You working on the soc project?

796
01:13:58,434 --> 01:14:02,564
God, when did you get so anal?

797
01:14:02,638 --> 01:14:04,401
When you started slacking off.

798
01:14:04,473 --> 01:14:06,737
I just have a lot on my plate.

799
01:14:06,809 --> 01:14:11,576
Right. Drinking like a fish, doing
drugs, going through people's drawers.

800
01:14:11,647 --> 01:14:13,512
Daddy!

801
01:14:13,582 --> 01:14:16,449
I heard you finally found
something harder than your head.

802
01:14:18,353 --> 01:14:20,321
- How's my little girl?
- Good.

803
01:14:20,389 --> 01:14:22,118
Really?

804
01:14:22,191 --> 01:14:25,490
- Hi. Nice to see you.
- It's nice to see you again.

805
01:14:25,561 --> 01:14:27,756
There's something
I've been meaning to ask you.

806
01:14:27,830 --> 01:14:31,129
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.

807
01:14:31,200 --> 01:14:32,758
Bye, Hadley.

808
01:14:32,835 --> 01:14:34,769
Bye, Alicia.

809
01:14:39,107 --> 01:14:41,132
Girls and their dads.

810
01:14:42,644 --> 01:14:44,612
All right.
Thank you, Rhoda.

811
01:14:44,680 --> 01:14:45,840
Sure.

812
01:14:52,187 --> 01:14:53,552
May 26.

813
01:14:53,622 --> 01:14:56,455
Graduation day
at Colby University-

814
01:14:56,525 --> 01:14:59,221
the awarding
of an academic degree.

815
01:14:59,294 --> 01:15:03,958
Today, 345 students
will be advancing.

816
01:15:04,032 --> 01:15:05,727
One will not.

817
01:15:09,671 --> 01:15:12,902
While the one left behind
lies in a hospital bed alone...

818
01:15:12,975 --> 01:15:16,240
her friends and colleagues
celebrate with their loved ones.

819
01:16:00,956 --> 01:16:04,221
They came to Colby
as young, unformed minds...

820
01:16:04,293 --> 01:16:06,727
in search of truth
and knowledge.

821
01:16:06,795 --> 01:16:10,060
As they leave,
the real world awaits...

822
01:16:10,132 --> 01:16:13,192
filled with hopes, dreams...

823
01:16:13,268 --> 01:16:15,964
opportunity and me.

824
01:16:16,038 --> 01:16:18,029
Sorry, y'all.
Excuse me. Excuse me.

825
01:16:18,106 --> 01:16:20,540
All right.
There they go right there.

826
01:16:20,609 --> 01:16:23,339
Excuse me, y'all.
I'm sorry.

827
01:16:23,412 --> 01:16:25,778
Excuse me. Watch out, y'all.
Comin' through.

828
01:16:25,847 --> 01:16:30,147
I'm sorry to interrupt.
Hadley Ashton, you're under arrest.

829
01:16:30,218 --> 01:16:31,947
I will not have you
harassing my students.

830
01:16:32,020 --> 01:16:35,148
They stopped being your students
12 minutes ago. Please come with me.

831
01:16:35,223 --> 01:16:37,817
You have the right to remain silent.
Excuse me, y'all. Sorry.

832
01:16:37,893 --> 01:16:41,454
- Dad?
- Right behind you.

833
01:16:45,701 --> 01:16:48,295
I kept looking
at that splint on your arm.

834
01:16:48,370 --> 01:16:51,168
Trevor told me about your fall.

835
01:16:52,207 --> 01:16:56,303
You were in the hospital, Hadley.
The day nurse remembers Alicia's visit.

836
01:16:56,378 --> 01:16:58,846
- Let me walk you out.
- Okay.

837
01:17:00,115 --> 01:17:01,309
Bye, Hadley.

838
01:17:01,383 --> 01:17:04,250
I've been thinking about
what we talked about the other day.

839
01:17:04,319 --> 01:17:07,311
- I'd really like to help you.
- Really?

840
01:17:07,389 --> 01:17:11,052
Yes. How'd you like
to come work for me?

841
01:17:11,126 --> 01:17:12,991
Gosh.

842
01:17:13,061 --> 01:17:16,224
Well, what I really want to do
is go to law school.

843
01:17:16,298 --> 01:17:18,858
Really?
Where have you applied?

844
01:17:18,934 --> 01:17:21,926
Baxter, Yale, Penn.

845
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:25,167
Well, I can't help you there,
but I am on the board at Stanford.

846
01:17:26,108 --> 01:17:29,635
Really?
Yeah, that's great...

847
01:17:29,711 --> 01:17:32,544
but it won't help me
with the financial aid.

848
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:34,377
_ 50-
- Wait a minute.

849
01:17:34,449 --> 01:17:38,215
You can clerk in our legal department
during the summers...

850
01:17:38,286 --> 01:17:41,619
and in exchange,
we'll pay your tuition.

851
01:17:41,690 --> 01:17:43,385
- How's that?
- Oh, my God.

852
01:17:43,458 --> 01:17:46,450
- Are you serious?
- Yeah.

853
01:17:46,528 --> 01:17:48,860
- Thank you so much.
- It's okay.

854
01:17:48,930 --> 01:17:50,955
It's just my way
of saying thank you...

855
01:17:51,033 --> 01:17:52,625
for you keeping an eye
on my daughter.

856
01:17:52,701 --> 01:17:55,636
And when you graduate...

857
01:17:55,704 --> 01:17:57,865
we get first shot at you.

858
01:17:57,939 --> 01:18:00,669
- Thank you.
- Sure.

859
01:18:04,179 --> 01:18:06,306
You're giving her a job?

860
01:18:06,381 --> 01:18:09,145
A total fucking stranger!

861
01:18:09,217 --> 01:18:11,879
You're doing everything for her,
but you won't hire me...

862
01:18:11,953 --> 01:18:14,979
your own flesh and blood,
your own fucking daughter!

863
01:18:15,057 --> 01:18:17,321
- This has nothing to do with you.
- She's a lying fucking...

864
01:18:17,392 --> 01:18:20,054
- manipulating, two-faced bitch!
- Hadley, stop it!

865
01:18:21,363 --> 01:18:23,695
There's a motive, Hadley.

866
01:18:23,765 --> 01:18:26,666
Alicia went after
everything you had...

867
01:18:26,735 --> 01:18:28,100
everything you valued.

868
01:18:30,839 --> 01:18:32,773
It's about my daughter.

869
01:18:36,344 --> 01:18:39,336
It was your father on the phone
with Alicia that day.

870
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:41,780
You pick up this phone
and you tell her it was a mistake.

871
01:18:41,850 --> 01:18:45,411
I'm not gonna give somebody something
and then take it away from them.

872
01:18:45,487 --> 01:18:49,685
- I'm not gonna go back on my word.
- No! You tell her!

873
01:18:49,758 --> 01:18:52,921
- Calm down.
- No. It's over.

874
01:18:54,229 --> 01:18:55,821
Tell her.

875
01:18:59,334 --> 01:19:01,359
- Hello?
- Can I speak with Alicia, please?

876
01:19:01,436 --> 01:19:03,199
- Alicia.
- Yeah.

877
01:19:03,271 --> 01:19:05,205
Hello?
Hi. How are you?

878
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:08,538
Remember what
we talked about earlier?

879
01:19:08,610 --> 01:19:11,204
Hadley would like
to congratulate you.

880
01:19:11,279 --> 01:19:13,509
Wouldn't you, Hadley?

881
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:24,618
Hey, Alicia.
Congratulations.

882
01:19:24,693 --> 01:19:28,060
Oh, my God!
I am so beyond excited.

883
01:19:28,130 --> 01:19:29,324
Thank you so much.

884
01:19:31,233 --> 01:19:32,495
What's up, Alicia?

885
01:19:32,567 --> 01:19:34,967
We'll keep you here for a while.

886
01:19:35,036 --> 01:19:38,995
If there's anything I can do
for you, just give a holler.

887
01:19:42,310 --> 01:19:46,679
See, Trevor saw the orderly
hit on you.

888
01:19:46,748 --> 01:19:50,514
- He was easy, wasn't? he?
- Did you get it?

889
01:19:50,585 --> 01:19:53,281
- I could lose my job for this.
- It'll be worth it.

890
01:19:58,894 --> 01:20:01,294
The night you left the hospital,
you called Alicia...

891
01:20:01,363 --> 01:20:03,729
and met her
at the Cilver Bullet.

892
01:20:03,799 --> 01:20:05,596
The whole bar saw you.

893
01:20:05,667 --> 01:20:08,033
- Everybody heard you.
- Don't walk away from me!

894
01:20:08,103 --> 01:20:10,537
- Nobody uses me to get to my father.
- I'm not!

895
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:13,096
- You're supposed to be my friend.
- I am your friend.

896
01:20:13,175 --> 01:20:17,612
- No! You no longer exist.
- Hadley! Hadley, don't leave me!

897
01:20:21,783 --> 01:20:25,116
You wanted her out of your life,
but you knew she'd show up at the party.

898
01:20:26,788 --> 01:20:29,655
I heard her with her dad,
and I saw her with this vial...

899
01:20:29,724 --> 01:20:32,249
- Sidney finally told the truth.
- but I didn't know what it was.

900
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:36,957
She heard you call your father.
She saw you put the coke in Max's paper.

901
01:20:37,032 --> 01:20:39,865
Daddy, come by for breakfast
before you go to the airport.

902
01:20:39,935 --> 01:20:42,529
Call me and let me know.
Bye.

903
01:20:42,604 --> 01:20:47,473
Just you, me and your little
strung-out protege.

904
01:20:48,543 --> 01:20:51,137
- Have you seen my lighter?
- No.

905
01:20:52,948 --> 01:20:54,313
Hurry up.
Go get dressed.

906
01:20:59,888 --> 01:21:02,948
Whatever your intent, you put
the coke where you knew she'd find it.

907
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:05,492
April Fools', bitch.

908
01:21:07,729 --> 01:21:10,892
I heard this crash.

909
01:21:10,966 --> 01:21:14,231
- Julianne tried to save her.
- And I found her.

910
01:21:15,704 --> 01:21:18,764
Alicia's OD'd!
Call 911! Hurry!

911
01:21:18,840 --> 01:21:22,435
And I called out to Hadley
to call student health...

912
01:21:22,510 --> 01:21:25,604
and I tried to give her
mouth-to-mouth...

913
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,843
- and I tried to revive her, but-
- Two! Hadley, where are they?

914
01:21:28,917 --> 01:21:31,112
Why didn't you call 911?

915
01:21:31,186 --> 01:21:32,312
We thought that-

916
01:21:32,387 --> 01:21:35,845
Because student health
is right down the street...

917
01:21:35,924 --> 01:21:38,757
and they have a doctor
on call 24 hours.

918
01:21:38,827 --> 01:21:40,727
Why aren't they here yet?

919
01:21:40,795 --> 01:21:42,763
- She'll be fine.
- She won't come to.

920
01:21:42,831 --> 01:21:44,856
Where's the phone?

921
01:21:45,700 --> 01:21:47,395
Oh, shit.

922
01:21:53,275 --> 01:21:54,606
Fuck!

923
01:21:56,344 --> 01:21:59,370
You did it all?
Oh, my God.

924
01:22:03,585 --> 01:22:05,678
You were smart enough
to switch the packets...

925
01:22:05,754 --> 01:22:08,382
- It's your basic party mix.
- But you forgot...

926
01:22:08,456 --> 01:22:11,653
- and left the real one in your robe.
- That's not what she took.

927
01:22:13,128 --> 01:22:16,256
- I'm gonna call 91 I.
- No, I already called student health.

928
01:22:16,331 --> 01:22:18,322
If you call 911,
it'll get the police involved.

929
01:22:18,400 --> 01:22:20,061
Lawrence ville emergency.

930
01:22:20,135 --> 01:22:22,569
We can't just wait for them.
She could die!

931
01:22:22,637 --> 01:22:25,401
Keep doing the CPR.

932
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:32,805
91 I recorded your call at 2:23.

933
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:37,579
The call to student health
was six minutes later.

934
01:22:37,652 --> 01:22:40,519
Whether you intended
to kill her or not...

935
01:22:40,588 --> 01:22:42,886
you created the circumstances
that put someone at risk.

936
01:22:42,958 --> 01:22:45,483
Once my father realizes
you're not perfect-

937
01:22:45,560 --> 01:22:47,687
What's the matter?
Are you jealous?

938
01:22:47,762 --> 01:22:49,593
You're really fucking paranoid.

939
01:22:49,664 --> 01:22:52,929
I'm paranoid?
That's really funny.

940
01:22:53,001 --> 01:22:55,902
Meaning?
No, you know what?

941
01:22:55,971 --> 01:22:59,964
I really don't wanna hear
your twisted little take on my life.

942
01:23:00,041 --> 01:23:03,533
Don't ever condescend
to me again.

943
01:23:03,611 --> 01:23:05,169
Student health?

944
01:23:05,246 --> 01:23:08,272
I am not your little windup doll,
like Sid or Julianne.

945
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:10,443
Oh, my God.
We've had a horrible accident.

946
01:23:10,518 --> 01:23:12,452
Why don't you go away?

947
01:23:12,520 --> 01:23:15,045
You want me to leave?

948
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:20,021
You're nothing but
a poor little rich girl...

949
01:23:20,095 --> 01:23:22,120
who never got enough love
from her father.

950
01:23:22,197 --> 01:23:25,030
Never thinking a significant thought,
just pretty enough to get by...

951
01:23:25,100 --> 01:23:27,728
by screwing around
on her fucking boyfriend.

952
01:23:29,137 --> 01:23:30,900
You know what?
I'll forgive you for that...

953
01:23:30,972 --> 01:23:33,440
because I assume that
you just don't know any better...

954
01:23:33,508 --> 01:23:36,739
because you come from
trailer park trash.

955
01:23:36,811 --> 01:23:39,109
Or is it the booze talking?

956
01:23:39,180 --> 01:23:43,207
But you know what I think?
You need to get the fuck out of here.

957
01:23:46,588 --> 01:23:47,680
I'm shaking.

958
01:23:52,127 --> 01:23:55,893
- How's she doing?
- I think she's stopped breathing!

959
01:24:03,738 --> 01:24:06,832
Hadley! Where are they?
Come on. Don't die.

960
01:24:10,278 --> 01:24:12,212
Come on, Alicia.
Don't die!

961
01:24:12,280 --> 01:24:14,771
Five, six.

962
01:24:34,736 --> 01:24:36,363
Sorry.

963
01:25:34,963 --> 01:25:36,988
Thank you.

964
01:26:04,959 --> 01:26:07,951
I understand you have something
you want to say to me.

965
01:26:28,082 --> 01:26:39,887
Was that okay, Warren?
Was that okay?
