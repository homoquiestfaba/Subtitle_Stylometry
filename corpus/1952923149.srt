1
00:00:06,216 --> 00:00:08,068
Santa baby 2

2
00:00:08,103 --> 00:00:09,324
Christmas Maybe

3
00:00:22,796 --> 00:00:24,878
Hut-ho, hut-ho, hut. Hut.

4
00:01:27,039 --> 00:01:28,427
Okay, what's next?

5
00:01:28,462 --> 00:01:30,121
These are for Webber Group.

6
00:01:30,156 --> 00:01:31,626
All right. This one.

7
00:01:31,661 --> 00:01:33,371
Okay. Oh, I got it.

8
00:01:33,406 --> 00:01:34,172
Thank you.

9
00:01:34,207 --> 00:01:35,484
Now, Gadgetech.

10
00:01:35,519 --> 00:01:37,341
This one, but in Helvetica.

11
00:01:37,376 --> 00:01:38,505
Mm-hmm. Oh, I got it.

12
00:01:38,540 --> 00:01:39,058
Thank you.

13
00:01:41,788 --> 00:01:42,891
Okay. Ooh. Here's your bagel.

14
00:01:42,926 --> 00:01:43,332
Mm.

15
00:01:43,367 --> 00:01:45,267
Okay, now Clarkford and Klein.

16
00:01:45,302 --> 00:01:46,866
They're exactly the same.

17
00:01:46,901 --> 00:01:48,243
Yeah, but I know you love having choices.

18
00:01:49,856 --> 00:01:53,286
Oh, and the bartender called. Would you prefer flaming rum punch or eggnog martinis?

19
00:01:53,865 --> 00:01:54,900
Both. It's a holiday party.

20
00:01:55,694 --> 00:01:56,420
What holiday party?

21
00:01:56,455 --> 00:01:57,147
Morning.

22
00:01:57,182 --> 00:01:58,321
Tonight. The merger party.

23
00:01:58,356 --> 00:02:02,465
For my clients and the London guys. Colin Nottingham and his group. You have to be there.

24
00:02:02,500 --> 00:02:06,543
Oh, I'd love to, babe, but my tux is at the dry cleaners.

25
00:02:06,578 --> 00:02:12,883
(sarcastic chuckle) You don't need a tux. You just need to bring that handsome mug of yours so I can show you off. It'll be fun, I promise.

26
00:02:12,918 --> 00:02:13,731
I'll be there.

27
00:02:13,766 --> 00:02:14,620
I got it.

28
00:02:14,655 --> 00:02:15,284
Oh, thank you.

29
00:02:15,319 --> 00:02:17,708
Oh, and we have about fifteen pages from legal for you to sign.

30
00:02:17,708 --> 00:02:20,036
Okay, we'll do it in the car. Oh!

31
00:02:20,071 --> 00:02:21,156
I got it. (kiss)

32
00:02:23,265 --> 00:02:24,301
I owe you one.

33
00:02:24,336 --> 00:02:24,870
Hmm.

34
00:02:29,623 --> 00:02:30,343
Thank you.

35
00:02:30,378 --> 00:02:30,848
You're welcome.

36
00:02:30,883 --> 00:02:31,355
I love you.

37
00:02:31,355 --> 00:02:31,834
I love you too.

38
00:02:31,834 --> 00:02:32,233
See you later.

39
00:02:32,233 --> 00:02:32,799
Bye.

40
00:02:35,800 --> 00:02:36,809
Have fun at work!

41
00:02:36,809 --> 00:02:37,891
Don't I always?

42
00:02:48,300 --> 00:02:49,153
Merry Christmas!

43
00:02:55,834 --> 00:02:58,659
Hey. Oh, uh, sorry. Sorry, my bad.

44
00:03:01,846 --> 00:03:04,227
Hey, looks like somebody got some Christmas cards.

45
00:03:04,262 --> 00:03:04,939
Great!

46
00:03:07,870 --> 00:03:08,686
Nope.

47
00:03:12,019 --> 00:03:13,517
Nada. Bupkis.

48
00:03:16,768 --> 00:03:17,657
There we go.

49
00:03:24,277 --> 00:03:26,912
Oh, hey, ma'am. I have a package for you.

50
00:03:27,416 --> 00:03:28,690
That's what my doorman's for.

51
00:03:35,319 --> 00:03:37,360
Hey! Watch where you're going, buddy!

52
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,785
Yeah, you too, pal! Yeah, merry Christmas!

53
00:03:46,948 --> 00:03:48,324
(sign)Welcome to the class marketing Holiday Party.

54
00:03:49,231 --> 00:03:50,302
Where's Luke?

55
00:03:50,302 --> 00:03:52,918
Don't know, late. Oh, Colin and the guys just showed up.

56
00:03:52,918 --> 00:03:55,463
All right, it is showtime. (clears throat)

57
00:03:59,638 --> 00:04:10,384
Hello, everyone. It's great to see all of you here. You know, if you'd asked me five years ago to make a list of all the clients I wanted to get, well, you'd all be on that list.

58
00:04:11,431 --> 00:04:14,306
So I guess I don't really need to ask Santa for anything this Christmas.

59
00:04:15,895 --> 00:04:27,344
Except that we have another record-breaking year like we just did. And maybe a few surprises waiting for you. So, here's to all of you. And happy holidays.

60
00:04:32,895 --> 00:04:33,770
Colin!

61
00:04:35,515 --> 00:04:36,425
So great to see you.

62
00:04:36,460 --> 00:04:37,567
Miss Class.

63
00:04:37,602 --> 00:04:40,038
Mary. I've told you twenty times, call me Mary.

64
00:04:40,073 --> 00:04:43,734
Very well, Mary. It is a pleasure to finally meet you in person.

65
00:04:43,769 --> 00:04:46,382
After how many hundreds of e-mails and phone calls?

66
00:04:46,417 --> 00:04:48,731
Hmm, yes. I do hope you'll find time to visit us in London.

67
00:04:48,766 --> 00:04:52,396
Oh, London. Beautiful city. Nice wide chimneys.

68
00:04:52,431 --> 00:05:00,307
Ch-Chimneys? Yes, I suppose so. It's quite an impressive collection of clients you've assembled for yourself, Mary.

69
00:05:00,342 --> 00:05:06,427
For ourselves, Colin. Unless you and the board are getting cold feet about the merger all of a sudden.

70
00:05:06,427 --> 00:05:09,265
Not at all. We couldn't be more excited by the prospect.

71
00:05:10,098 --> 00:05:12,423
Come on, I'll introduce you to the rest of the team.

72
00:05:23,455 --> 00:05:24,144
(exhales) Oh, hey. Thank you.

73
00:05:24,179 --> 00:05:24,994
You're welcome.

74
00:05:31,464 --> 00:05:32,773
(chuckles) So you're ready to go worldwide?

75
00:05:32,808 --> 00:05:33,423
I think so.

76
00:05:34,655 --> 00:05:35,823
Are we enjoying ourselves?

77
00:05:35,858 --> 00:05:37,184
Hey, Sandman.

78
00:05:37,806 --> 00:05:40,117
It is a party, you know. Feel free to mingle.

79
00:05:40,152 --> 00:05:41,149
I'm okay, thanks.

80
00:05:41,184 --> 00:05:43,239
Does, uh, Mary even know you're here?

81
00:05:44,081 --> 00:05:45,472
She's busy. I don't want to bother her.

82
00:05:45,507 --> 00:05:46,970
Aren't you adorable? Come on.

83
00:05:50,485 --> 00:06:01,660
Well, no one can have it both ways. The future of any company is defined by those crossroads. Moments where someone needs to make a choice. It's not always easy picking the right path, but that's where I come in.

84
00:06:01,660 --> 00:06:04,253
Well, I think that we've made an excellent choice ourselves.

85
00:06:04,288 --> 00:06:05,163
Thank you.

86
00:06:05,198 --> 00:06:06,181
Look who I found.

87
00:06:06,216 --> 00:06:06,957
Luke!

88
00:06:06,992 --> 00:06:07,471
Babe. (chuckles)

89
00:06:07,506 --> 00:06:08,049
Hi, honey.

90
00:06:08,591 --> 00:06:10,431
Everyone, this is Luke Jessup, my boyfriend.

91
00:06:10,466 --> 00:06:11,279
Hi. Nice to meet you.

92
00:06:11,314 --> 00:06:11,951
Clive.

93
00:06:11,986 --> 00:06:13,032
A pleasure.

94
00:06:13,067 --> 00:06:13,755
Charles.

95
00:06:13,790 --> 00:06:14,618
Hi.

96
00:06:14,653 --> 00:06:15,225
Neville.

97
00:06:15,260 --> 00:06:16,377
This is Colin Nottingham from the Whitmore Corporation.

98
00:06:16,895 --> 00:06:18,121
It is very nice to meet you, Colin.

99
00:06:18,156 --> 00:06:21,025
The pleasure's mine. So, how long have you been in marketing?

100
00:06:22,281 --> 00:06:23,686
Oh, (slight chuckle) Luke doesn't work with me.

101
00:06:23,721 --> 00:06:27,511
Oh really? Let me guess. Product integration.

102
00:06:27,511 --> 00:06:28,590
Uh, no. (slight chuckle)

103
00:06:28,625 --> 00:06:30,358
New business development, then.

104
00:06:30,393 --> 00:06:36,880
No. More like, uh, distribution. I'm a mailman. Oh, I'm also a small business owner as well.

105
00:06:36,915 --> 00:06:38,801
Really? And what kind of business would that be?

106
00:06:38,836 --> 00:06:40,185
Dog sledding.

107
00:06:40,220 --> 00:06:45,153
Dog sledding, how charming. Is there much call for that sort of thing around here?

108
00:06:50,415 --> 00:06:54,207
Well, with the right marketing campaign, who knows, right?

109
00:06:54,862 --> 00:06:56,950
Right, right, marketing.

110
00:06:56,985 --> 00:06:58,006
Yes. (chuckles)

111
00:07:00,508 --> 00:07:02,031
Um, I'm going to get another drink, babe. All right.

112
00:07:02,031 --> 00:07:02,992
Okay.

113
00:07:02,992 --> 00:07:03,598
Nice to meet you.

114
00:07:03,598 --> 00:07:04,157
Our pleasure.

115
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:04,887
Me as well.

116
00:07:07,757 --> 00:07:09,055
So, where were we?

117
00:07:10,373 --> 00:07:19,189
ANNOUNCER(into microphone) All right, hepcats, we've got a real special treat for you all tonight. Playing their very first gig, here in the big city, give a hot, hot welcome for Cold Vision.

118
00:07:19,642 --> 00:07:20,771
Here we go, guys!

119
00:07:34,133 --> 00:07:35,326
Oh my God!

120
00:07:45,400 --> 00:07:45,972
Excuse me.

121
00:07:46,007 --> 00:07:46,716
Of course.

122
00:07:54,915 --> 00:07:55,683
Dad!

123
00:07:55,718 --> 00:07:56,899
Mary!

124
00:07:56,934 --> 00:08:00,949
It's ten days till Christmas! What are you doing here?

125
00:08:00,984 --> 00:08:04,068
What am I doing here? What are you doing here? Why aren't you at the North Pole?

126
00:08:04,068 --> 00:08:16,172
Mary? Hold on a moment. Are you telling me that your father is...a jazz musician?

127
00:08:16,207 --> 00:08:19,474
Yeah, baby. A-one, a-two, a-one, two, three, four!

128
00:08:19,474 --> 00:08:20,249
Uh, can you excuse us for a moment?

129
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:20,882
Oh certainly.

130
00:08:20,882 --> 00:08:23,888
I need to talk to you now.

131
00:08:29,237 --> 00:08:30,921
Have you lost your mind?

132
00:08:31,479 --> 00:08:31,847
Of course not.

133
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:33,120
Mr. C! (chuckles) Hey!

134
00:08:33,155 --> 00:08:34,542
Hey-Hey! Luke, what up? (chuckles)

135
00:08:34,577 --> 00:08:36,186
What up? Uh, what are you doing here?

136
00:08:36,221 --> 00:08:37,552
I'm jamming with my band.

137
00:08:37,587 --> 00:08:38,305
Nice.

138
00:08:38,340 --> 00:08:39,302
Since when do you have a band?

139
00:08:39,337 --> 00:08:42,488
Going on three weeks. This is our first big gig in the lower forty-eight.

140
00:08:42,523 --> 00:08:44,920
Nick! You're being paid to play.

141
00:08:45,911 --> 00:08:46,415
Skip?

142
00:08:46,450 --> 00:08:47,015
Skipper!

143
00:08:47,050 --> 00:08:47,709
Hey!

144
00:08:49,278 --> 00:08:50,359
Did you just call him Nick?

145
00:08:50,394 --> 00:08:59,629
Yeah, we're on a first name basis. (to Santa) Aren't we? Uh, Mr. Nick? Mr. Santa? Santa? Sir? Boss?

146
00:08:59,664 --> 00:09:00,918
Did you bring all the elves with you?

147
00:09:00,953 --> 00:09:03,453
No, it's just me. I, uh, manage the band.

148
00:09:03,488 --> 00:09:04,071
No you don't.

149
00:09:04,106 --> 00:09:05,831
Well, I book the gigs.

150
00:09:05,866 --> 00:09:06,470
No.

151
00:09:06,505 --> 00:09:06,964
I...

152
00:09:07,194 --> 00:09:07,908
Drive the bus.

153
00:09:07,943 --> 00:09:10,299
(slight chuckle) Uh, to the gigs.

154
00:09:10,334 --> 00:09:14,620
Uh, I hate to interrupt here but you do realize it's December, right? Don't you have a job to do?

155
00:09:14,655 --> 00:09:19,387
Not me. You. You are supposed to be up at the North Pole right now, running Christmas.

156
00:09:19,422 --> 00:09:24,180
(scoffs) Well, you think you might have shared that with me any time in the past, oh, eleven months?

157
00:09:24,215 --> 00:09:25,389
Didn't you get my letter?

158
00:09:25,424 --> 00:09:26,796
No, what are you talking about?

159
00:09:26,831 --> 00:09:27,358
(whispers) Let's go.

160
00:09:27,393 --> 00:09:28,757
An actual letter?

161
00:09:28,792 --> 00:09:29,246
Yeah.

162
00:09:29,281 --> 00:09:30,859
Dad, no one writes letters anymore!

163
00:09:30,894 --> 00:09:32,194
I get lots letters all the time.

164
00:09:32,229 --> 00:09:33,241
Well, that's because you're--

165
00:09:34,538 --> 00:09:38,496
You. Dad, please just go. For me?

166
00:09:39,735 --> 00:09:40,383
All right.

167
00:09:40,418 --> 00:09:43,238
(scoffs) Luke, will you please take them back to the apartment?

168
00:09:43,273 --> 00:09:44,219
Tonight.

169
00:09:44,254 --> 00:09:46,092
Really? And miss the rest of this great party?

170
00:09:46,127 --> 00:09:50,643
Yeah, I know you'll be crying your eyes out. Thanks. (kiss) I'm sorry; it's going to be a late night tonight.

171
00:09:50,678 --> 00:09:51,940
Pizza?

172
00:09:51,975 --> 00:09:53,376
Now? Right on.

173
00:09:55,420 --> 00:09:56,168
Call me.

174
00:09:56,168 --> 00:09:57,030
Oh my God.

175
00:09:59,824 --> 00:10:01,385
(pizza box)Di Lucci's

176
00:10:01,420 --> 00:10:02,131
Pizza

177
00:10:42,481 --> 00:10:44,972
 (laugh) (overlapping chatter) Direct hit! Okay. Here you go! Ooh! (continues)

178
00:10:46,972 --> 00:10:49,292
 Ew, go away, Luke! You're gross!

179
00:10:49,327 --> 00:10:51,193
 You'll never get away from me, Mary.

180
00:10:51,228 --> 00:10:52,775
Ooh, hot cocoa for everyone.

181
00:10:54,030 --> 00:10:56,310
You are right helpful, little elf.

182
00:10:56,310 --> 00:10:58,456
Oh, oh, oh, sh, sh. Guys, guys, g-guys. Keep it down, Mary's still asleep.

183
00:10:59,185 --> 00:10:59,904
 Boys stink.

184
00:11:04,714 --> 00:11:06,470
This is great. I haven't seen this in years. (laughs)

185
00:11:11,218 --> 00:11:13,607
Yeah, that's not very funny, guys. That-That really hurt.

186
00:11:13,642 --> 00:11:14,934
Morning, boys.

187
00:11:14,969 --> 00:11:17,007
Hey, babe. What time did you get in last night?

188
00:11:17,042 --> 00:11:18,776
Very, very late.

189
00:11:18,811 --> 00:11:20,113
Why didn't you wake us up?

190
00:11:20,148 --> 00:11:22,890
Well, you all looked so cozy. And passed out.

191
00:11:24,459 --> 00:11:28,222
All right, party's over. Dad, when are you going to get back to work?

192
00:11:28,257 --> 00:11:32,258
Uh, actually, Mary, I'm not. I'm going to take a little time for myself.

193
00:11:32,293 --> 00:11:36,211
Really? Well, you have time off. January through November.

194
00:11:36,246 --> 00:11:43,669
Ho, ho, maybe in the fifteen-hundreds. But nowadays I'm lucky if I get I get one day in leap year. So, Santa's going to make a few changes.

195
00:11:43,704 --> 00:11:46,206
Aren't you a little old to be going through a mid-life crisis?

196
00:11:46,241 --> 00:11:49,189
It's not a mid-life crisis, I'm just trying to recapture my youth.

197
00:11:49,224 --> 00:11:52,805
Right. (chuckles) I'm going to call Mom.

198
00:11:52,840 --> 00:11:54,507
You'll get no help there. (laughs)

199
00:11:56,516 --> 00:11:57,313
Ooh, you're in big trouble, Mr. C.

200
00:11:57,313 --> 00:11:58,202
(chuckles) Oh. Big trouble.

201
00:12:00,990 --> 00:12:02,630
Good morning, Claus Residence.

202
00:12:02,665 --> 00:12:06,052
Uh, hi. Who's this?

203
00:12:06,087 --> 00:12:10,282
Uh, why, this is Teri. Merry Christmas. And who might you be?

204
00:12:10,317 --> 00:12:13,412
This is Mary. I'm looking for my mom.

205
00:12:14,756 --> 00:12:17,822
I'm afraid she's stepped away for a moment. May I take a message?

206
00:12:17,857 --> 00:12:22,089
Yeah, can you tell her that I called (over phone) and that I have Dad?

207
00:12:22,124 --> 00:12:22,681
Mm-hmm.

208
00:12:22,716 --> 00:12:23,481
Thanks so much.

209
00:12:27,049 --> 00:12:32,217
All right. Listen, I have so much to do today. Tons of meetings. So I don't really have time for this.

210
00:12:32,252 --> 00:12:37,842
Uh, l-listen, babe. Go to work and I'll baby-sit for the day.

211
00:12:37,877 --> 00:12:38,456
Are you sure?

212
00:12:38,491 --> 00:12:40,927
Are you kidding me? It'll be just like old times.

213
00:12:40,962 --> 00:12:41,817
Oh, thank you.

214
00:12:41,852 --> 00:12:43,875

Huh, so this is what Christmas is to all of you city slickers, huh?

218
00:13:06,286 --> 00:13:11,915
(chuckles) Hey, don't look at me. I'm a Polaris boy at heart. Hey, how are my dogs doing? You ever get a chance to see them?

00:13:13,352 --> 00:13:17,899
(reads) "A little bit of Christmas in every bite." Did we authorize this?

220
00:13:19,253 --> 00:13:20,069
Uh, I don't know.

221
00:13:20,104 --> 00:13:22,053
Remind me to call my lawyer.

222
00:13:22,088 --> 00:13:23,816
I am your lawyer.

223
00:13:23,851 --> 00:13:26,373
Remind me to get a new lawyer.

224
00:13:29,284 --> 00:13:30,143

Hey.

232
00:13:42,458 --> 00:13:42,902
Hello.

Santa.

00:13:50,300 --> 00:13:51,121

00:13:54,883 --> 00:13:55,848
Okay, big smile.

237
00:13:59,664 --> 00:14:04,648
Hey, Mac. What gives? I've got an exclusive contract on this place all of December.

238
00:14:04,683 --> 00:14:06,991
The whole month, wow. Good for you.

239
00:14:07,026 --> 00:14:11,030
Uh, well, good luck with that. Why don't we just get out of here, guys, huh?

240
00:14:11,065 --> 00:14:16,095
It seems a little steep to me. Twenty-five bucks for a snap of a sloppy wannabe.

241
00:14:16,130 --> 00:14:19,704
Listen, buddy. If you know what's good for you, you'll beat it.

242
00:14:21,669 --> 00:14:27,763
Well, if it's all about the children, all right. Merry Christmas.

243
00:14:29,285 --> 00:14:32,788
(overlapping chatter) Santa. There's Santa. Yeah. Santa.

244
00:14:33,478 --> 00:14:38,333
Hey! Hey! What do you think you're doing, huh? What do you think you're doing?

245
00:14:39,516 --> 00:14:40,856
Naughty.

246
00:14:40,856 --> 00:14:43,377
Naughty? I'll show you naughty.

247
00:14:51,974 --> 00:14:57,290
ÇÝÊOkay, hold still. Almost finished. Don't move.

248
00:15:04,106 --> 00:15:06,090
All right, I'm going to give you guys one more chance, you got it?

249
00:15:09,598 --> 00:15:12,250
God rest ye merry gentlemen

Remember Christ our savior

252
00:15:17,724 --> 00:15:19,969
Was born on Christmas Day

253
00:15:20,004 --> 00:15:22,962
To save us all from Satan's power

Jail, Dad? Jail?

260
00:15:44,601 --> 00:15:45,790
Well, you see...

261
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,317
(scoffs) What happened?

262
00:15:47,352 --> 00:15:48,812
He started it, babe.

263
00:15:50,078 --> 00:15:51,628
ÇÝÊ Ah. Looks good.

264
00:15:51,663 --> 00:15:52,708
Way to set an example.

265
00:15:52,743 --> 00:15:55,538
You've got to get me out of here. The band is leaving for Chicago.

266
00:15:55,573 --> 00:15:58,698
Left, Dad. Tours over, especially for you.

267
00:15:58,733 --> 00:16:02,170
Snowballs! We were supposed to open for Huey Lewis.

268
00:16:02,205 --> 00:16:08,463
I don't want to hear it. It's bad enough you're ignoring Christmas, but now you're messing up my life. That's it, we're going back to the North Pole.

269
00:16:08,498 --> 00:16:11,064
Yeah, it's about time. You and Luke should have left weeks ago.

270
00:16:11,099 --> 00:16:15,937
Not me and Luke. All of us. All of us are going back.

271
00:16:15,972 --> 00:16:18,465
Yeah! All right! Whoo!

272
00:16:18,500 --> 00:16:19,202

294
00:17:47,750 --> 00:17:55,453
Why mess with perfection, babe, right? I mean, think about it. Me, you, bearskin rug, hot cocoa.

295
00:17:58,042 --> 00:17:59,158
Roaring fire.

296
00:17:59,193 --> 00:18:03,366
Ah, well, that could work.

297
00:18:04,876 --> 00:18:07,393
Just don't get too comfortable, we're not going to be here that long.

298
00:18:07,428 --> 00:18:08,082
We're not?

299
00:18:08,117 --> 00:18:17,892
Nope! All right, phase one: Get Dad up here. Phase two: Get him focused on Christmas. Phase three: Avert the elven apocalypse. Phase four: Business class back to New York.

300
00:18:17,927 --> 00:18:19,455
Elven apocalypse?

301
00:18:19,490 --> 00:18:23,480
The elves have been unsupervised for three weeks. I'm surprised we can't see the smoke from here.

302
00:18:23,515 --> 00:18:27,855
Hey, come here. It sounds like this is going to take a while to get back on track.

303
00:18:27,890 --> 00:18:33,964
Mm. (kiss) Then again, the elves have been making toys for hundreds of years, what's ten more minutes?

304
00:18:33,999 --> 00:18:37,063
Uh-huh. Exactly.

305
00:18:38,643 --> 00:18:39,595
Maybe even twenty.

306
00:19:03,385 --> 00:19:06,460
Mom, I'm h-- Oh, what happened here?

307
00:19:06,495 --> 00:19:11,049
Oh, Mary! Ah, thank goodness you're home! (laughs)

308
00:19:11,084 --> 00:19:14,891
Oh, I'm happy to see you too. So what's with all the cookies?

309
00:19:14,926 --> 00:19:19,166
Well, I'm just trying to keep busy. Baking calms the nerves.

310
00:19:19,201 --> 00:19:22,182
Mom, if baking calmed your nerves, you'd be catatonic.

311
00:19:22,217 --> 00:19:29,976
Well, it's been a rough couple of weeks around here. What with your father gone and you being so late.

312
00:19:30,011 --> 00:19:33,132
I'm not late. I only found out Dad was gone only two days ago.

313
00:19:34,437 --> 00:19:36,223
What-- You didn't get the letter?

314
00:19:36,258 --> 00:19:41,609
Again with the letter. I have a home phone, office phone, cell phone, fax, e-mail. I'm not that hard to get ahold of.

315
00:19:42,177 --> 00:19:43,820
Well, he's old fashioned.

316
00:19:43,855 --> 00:19:49,020
I found him jamming with a jazz quartet in Soho. He's not old fashioned. What's wrong with him?

317
00:19:49,555 --> 00:19:54,820
Oh nothing. No-Nothing at all. Everything is perfectly normal. He's just going through some changes.

318
00:19:54,855 --> 00:19:58,763
He's had the same haircut for six hundred years. He doesn't change.

319
00:19:58,798 --> 00:20:10,561
Oh that's what I thought. But ever since your improvements around here, well, he's had some free time on his hands and that's when the hobbies started.

320
00:20:10,562 --> 00:20:17,676
Oh it's nice to see him having so much fun, but I just wonder when things will start to get back to normal around here.

321
00:20:17,711 --> 00:20:21,012
Now. Things are going to get back to normal now.

322

Oh, Mary! You're here! Oh!

327
00:20:55,994 --> 00:21:00,134
Gary, all right, all right, all right. Lay it on me. Critical stuff first. What's wrong this time?

328
00:21:00,169 --> 00:21:01,127
Uh, nothing.

329
00:21:01,162 --> 00:21:07,187
Santa's been away for a month and you're telling me there's no fractures, felonies or fatalities?

330
00:21:07,222 --> 00:21:10,500
Uh, no, no and no.

331
00:21:10,535 --> 00:21:16,316

00:21:44,222 --> 00:21:49,277
Why, of course. The daughter that saved Christmas. You're a regular legend around here.

336
00:21:53,605 --> 00:21:58,111

337
00:21:58,146 --> 00:21:59,031
Okay.

338
00:21:59,066 --> 00:22:01,709
That's the spirit, Gary. Go team. (chuckles)

339
00:22:04,928 --> 00:22:07,078
So, who are you, anyway?

340
00:22:07,113 --> 00:22:13,311
Oh, look at me, there I go again, running off at the mouth. Teri McMillan, Polaris Postal Service!

00:22:13,346 --> 00:22:15,895
Oh, you took over for Luke.

342
00:22:15,930 --> 00:22:23,767
I-I was in the Congo delivering malaria vaccines to a school for blind orphans, but then I heard about the opening here

343
00:22:23,768 --> 00:22:30,968
and when an opportunity like that comes along, y-you've got to take it. After all, this is-is where the magic happens.

344
00:22:34,245 --> 00:22:39,036
Well, shouldn't you be making that magic happen over at the post office? (slight chuckle)

345
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:50,113
Well, of course. But with Santa being gone, someone had to step in and... You know how those elves are. I had to keep an eye on things. (chuckles)

346
00:22:51,824 --> 00:23:02,321
Well, thank you. Great. Santa's back and I can take it from here. I'm just going to go call a staff meeting and I'm sure you know how to get back to the post office.

347
00:23:03,833 --> 00:23:06,627
All right, everyone, gather around!

348
00:23:10,622 --> 00:23:13,252
(overlapping chatter) Meeting time. Come on, everybody! Meeting!

349
00:23:13,287 --> 00:23:13,860
(slight chuckle) Quick staff meeting!

350
00:23:13,895 --> 00:23:16,395
Gary, is that eggnog?

351
00:23:16,430 --> 00:23:16,900
Easy.

352
00:23:16,935 --> 00:23:17,548
But I just--

353
00:23:17,583 --> 00:23:18,061
(interrupts) No.

354
00:23:18,096 --> 00:23:18,404
Okay.

355
00:23:18,439 --> 00:23:18,931
Down, boy.

356
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:29,157
I am back. I will be running things again until we get Santa back at work. So, everyone just keep doing what you're doing.

357
00:23:36,528 --> 00:23:40,748
All right, everyone, let's give a big hand for Mary Claus.

358
00:23:43,701 --> 00:23:49,181
Come on, guys, you can do better than that. This is Mary! Let's show her some of that Christmas spirit.

359
00:23:49,216 --> 00:23:53,043
(overlapping chatter) Yay! Whoo-hoo! Hooray!

360
00:23:53,078 --> 00:24:01,987
(chuckles) Much better! All right, everyone, now let's go make some toys!

361
00:24:02,022 --> 00:24:02,891
Toys! (cheer)

362
00:24:02,926 --> 00:24:07,147
That's what I'm talking about! Right-- Oh. Thank you.

363
00:24:07,147 --> 00:24:08,506
See you later, Teri.

364
00:24:10,398 --> 00:24:11,101
Whatever.

365
00:24:25,110 --> 00:24:25,964
ÝËÜÔ
Hi there!

366
00:24:38,122 --> 00:24:39,483
Hey there, sweet cheeks!

367
00:24:39,518 --> 00:24:42,812
(slight chuckle) Nicholas, where did you get that ridiculous thing?

368
00:24:42,847 --> 00:24:47,041
I figured it's time for a new ride. What do you think? Makes me look younger, right?

369
00:24:47,076 --> 00:24:49,457
Sure, you don't look a day over eight hundred!

370
00:24:49,492 --> 00:24:50,370
Ho, ho, ho.

371
00:24:52,783 --> 00:24:53,739
Look out!

372
00:24:58,332 --> 00:25:00,240
North Pole

373
00:25:03,753 --> 00:25:05,177
Ñòîé!

374
00:25:09,006 --> 00:25:09,706
Be good. (exhales)

375
00:25:14,146 --> 00:25:15,386
Oh, hey! (chuckles)

376
00:25:15,421 --> 00:25:17,068
Well, hello there! (chuckles)

377
00:25:18,229 --> 00:25:20,395
Oh, you're the new gal. Teri, right?

378
00:25:20,430 --> 00:25:23,276
Luke Jessup? I can't believe it's really you!

379
00:25:23,311 --> 00:25:24,876
Okay. (chuckles)

380
00:25:24,911 --> 00:25:29,787
You're a regular legend around here. It's-It's an honor to follow in your footsteps.

381
00:25:29,822 --> 00:25:33,008
Really? (chuckles) I was-I was just a mailman.

382
00:25:33,043 --> 00:25:44,008
(scoffs) Just a mailman, he says. You were the mailman. The Christmas mailman. Getting to deliver to the big S is-- (grunts) Is every mail carrier's dream job!

383
00:25:44,612 --> 00:25:48,752
Well, it had its moments, I have to admit. Hey-Hey, let me help you with that. (grunts)

384
00:25:49,149 --> 00:25:50,692
Oh. Look at you, the old pro. (slight chuckle)

385
00:25:51,739 --> 00:25:53,299
I'm-I'm not imposing on you, am I?

386
00:25:53,334 --> 00:25:54,197
Oh, not at all.

387
00:25:54,768 --> 00:25:55,760
It'll be like old times.

388
00:25:56,249 --> 00:25:57,095
Beg your pardon?

389
00:25:57,095 --> 00:25:58,096
ÌÓÆÑÊÎÉ
Hey, Luke! Good to see you!

390
00:25:58,131 --> 00:26:05,433
Oh you know. Being back on my old mail route, seeing my friends. It's nothing like delivering in the city. No appreciation whatsoever.

391
00:26:05,468 --> 00:26:13,051
Hmm. Well, I know I'd appreciate it if you'd let me pick your brain sometime. I-I-I just have so many questions.

392
00:26:13,086 --> 00:26:19,270
Sure. Hey, anytime. You know, it's really nice to find someone who shares the same--

393
00:26:19,305 --> 00:26:19,968
(interrupts) Passion?

394
00:26:23,465 --> 00:26:29,609
I was going to say interests but, um, passion works.

395
00:26:33,652 --> 00:26:34,413
Okay.

396
00:26:34,448 --> 00:26:34,883
Yes.

397
00:26:38,089 --> 00:26:39,233
Um... (grunts) Off we go.

398
00:26:44,258 --> 00:26:46,076
4 äíÿ äî ðîæäåñòâà.

399
00:26:46,878 --> 00:26:52,226
Sandy, you have to set up some video conferences. This merger is absolutely vital to our bottom line.

400
00:26:53,440 --> 00:27:01,718
And we have to make sure all the clients are on board. Uh-huh. Yeah, I know. Well, I'm going to be up here for a while. All right, I'll talk to you later.

401
00:27:01,753 --> 00:27:03,340
Hey, honey. Keeping busy?

402
00:27:03,375 --> 00:27:05,237
Are you responsible for this?

403
00:27:05,272 --> 00:27:06,013
What?

404
00:27:06,048 --> 00:27:09,628
The cockamamie wrapping schedule. It doesn't make any sense.

405
00:27:09,663 --> 00:27:11,487
Hey, Nick! Hitting the links again?

406
00:27:11,522 --> 00:27:12,151
Nick?

407
00:27:12,186 --> 00:27:15,080
I shaved two points off my handicap already.

408
00:27:15,115 --> 00:27:18,504
I knew you'd like it. Just think of them as eighteen little chimneys. (slight chuckle)

409
00:27:18,539 --> 00:27:20,149
All right, see you both later.

410
00:27:20,184 --> 00:27:22,228
Dad! Wrapping schedule?

411
00:27:22,263 --> 00:27:24,982
Would you explain your new system to Mary?

412
00:27:25,017 --> 00:27:26,117
Your system?

413
00:27:26,152 --> 00:27:27,412
It's really quite simple.

414
00:27:27,447 --> 00:27:32,493
No, it's not. We tried something like that last year. It didn't work then and it won't work now.

415
00:27:32,528 --> 00:27:48,142
Um, well, last year you just switched the shifts. This is new. Each elf is assigned a specific size and shape. That way everyone has the right size paper every time. No special measuring, no delays. See?

416
00:27:53,193 --> 00:27:57,583
You just have to be a little more flexible. I knew that Teri would make the perfect assistant for you.

417
00:27:57,618 --> 00:27:58,973
& Assistant?

418
00:27:59,008 --> 00:28:01,556
Yeah. She's a people person. The elves love her.

419
00:28:01,591 --> 00:28:02,660
Oh, well...

420
00:28:02,695 --> 00:28:12,114
Dad, I have an assistant. He's in New York, where my job is. Where my life is. This is your job and your life. When are you going to quit goofing off and get back to work?

421
00:28:14,162 --> 00:28:16,439
Well, never.

422
00:28:29,290 --> 00:28:30,593
What do you mean you want to retire?

423
00:28:32,490 --> 00:28:40,411
(exhales) Mary, I have been doing this for so long, I can't remember the time that your mother and I had a chance to go out for dinner, let alone take a vacation.

424
00:28:40,446 --> 00:28:42,474
You're Santa. What do you expect?

425
00:28:42,509 --> 00:28:51,228
Christmas is really important. People have to believe in the spirit of giving. And for a long time I believed that I was the only one who could provide that.

426
00:28:51,263 --> 00:28:52,117
You are.

427
00:28:52,152 --> 00:28:55,991
I'm not. And last year you proved that.

428
00:28:57,174 --> 00:29:03,380
Everybody mistakes me for the holiday. They think I'm Christmas. But I'm not. I only work here.

429
00:29:03,381 --> 00:29:12,893
Or I did. You know, it's really hard for a father to realize that his little girl is all grown up.

430
00:29:15,270 --> 00:29:23,007
There was a time when I was younger when I couldn't imagine giving this job to anybody else. Now I can't imagine giving it to anybody else but you.

431
00:29:35,914 --> 00:29:37,228
I'd be so proud.

432
00:29:42,389 --> 00:29:43,326
What do you say?

433
00:29:54,443 --> 00:29:58,039
Hey, Nick. Um, about the whole assistant thing...

434
00:29:58,074 --> 00:30:00,928
Oh right. Don't worry about that. It's only-only temporary.

435
00:30:00,963 --> 00:30:04,909
Oh! Phew, what a relief! I was afraid that your were going--

436
00:30:04,944 --> 00:30:13,111
(interrupts) No, you see, Mary's going to be up to speed in no time. Then you can get back to your old life. I'm sure you have better things to do than hang around a boring old workshop.

437
00:30:13,146 --> 00:30:16,865
(scoffs) But I-I love it here. And you said yourself we make a great team.

438
00:30:16,900 --> 00:30:17,937
I did?

439
00:30:17,972 --> 00:30:22,699
Yes, remember when I was helping you make a list of everything you missed out on in life?

440
00:30:22,734 --> 00:30:25,509
Yeah, well, Mary's here now and Christmas is what she does best.

441
00:30:25,544 --> 00:30:29,636
But I thought she had a whole other job -- a life -- back-back in the city.

442
00:30:29,671 --> 00:30:36,317
It's in her blood. It's what she was born to do. As long as Mary's happy here, then she'll stay. Teri, keep it running smoothly.

443
00:30:38,909 --> 00:30:43,668
Oh, I'll make sure it runs smoothly, all right. Smooth as a...

444
00:30:43,703 --> 00:30:44,780
Marble?

445
00:30:44,815 --> 00:30:46,292
(gasps) Oh! What are we doing?

446
00:30:46,327 --> 00:30:47,742
We're naming things that are smooth.

447
00:30:48,390 --> 00:30:49,358
Uh, icicles!

448
00:30:49,393 --> 00:30:50,559
Uh, bowling balls!

449
00:30:50,594 --> 00:30:51,269
Smoothies!

450
00:30:51,304 --> 00:30:52,499
(gasps) Oh, good one!

451
00:30:52,534 --> 00:30:53,875
(exhales) I'm leaving.

452
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,187
Porcupines!

453
00:30:55,222 --> 00:30:55,834
Huh?

454
00:30:55,869 --> 00:30:56,532
That are bald!

455
00:30:56,567 --> 00:30:57,596
(gasps) Or sandpaper.

456
00:30:57,631 --> 00:30:58,188
What?

457
00:30:58,223 --> 00:30:58,918
That's been worn.

458
00:30:58,953 --> 00:30:59,629
Oh. Glass.

459
00:30:59,664 --> 00:31:01,205
That's eroded. Nails.

460
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:01,856
That are filed.

461
00:31:01,891 --> 00:31:03,511
(slight chuckle) Gravel.

462
00:31:03,945 --> 00:31:06,484
Covered in marzipan!

463
00:31:07,569 --> 00:31:11,038
All right, we don't have a lot of time. So how are your departments doing?

464
00:31:11,075 --> 00:31:15,610
Oh, letters is super fun. There's a new candy cane stamp and if you lick it, everything you eat for the rest of the day--

465
00:31:15,645 --> 00:31:17,218
(interrupts) On schedule or behind schedule?

466
00:31:17,253 --> 00:31:18,233
Oh, we're almost done.

467
00:31:18,268 --> 00:31:21,329
Terrific. Gary? The toys? How are the teddy bears coming along?

468
00:31:21,364 --> 00:31:26,134
Oh, we're trying to, uh, increase cuddliness by ten percent. Right now we're at about, hmm, eight.

469
00:31:26,171 --> 00:31:27,445
Fine. Skip? Wrapping?

470
00:31:27,480 --> 00:31:29,243
Oh, I like wrapping.

471
00:31:29,278 --> 00:31:30,554
Who wants cookies?

472
00:31:30,589 --> 00:31:32,258
(overlapping chatter) Oh, I do!

473
00:31:32,293 --> 00:31:35,497
Uh, we're having a meeting right here.

474
00:31:35,532 --> 00:31:39,723
Lemon zing for Gary, double butter for Dave, cinnamon hearts for Lucy, and peppermint swirl for Skip.

475
00:31:40,132 --> 00:31:43,092
Oh. Thanks Teri, you're the best.

476
00:31:43,092 --> 00:31:46,703
Aw, anything for you, Skip. So, what's your meeting all about?

477
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:48,767
Well, it's, uh, for department heads only.

478
00:31:51,924 --> 00:31:53,684
And since you’re not a department head...

479
00:31:53,719 --> 00:31:58,499
Oh! Maybe Teri could be head of the cookie making department.

480
00:31:58,534 --> 00:31:59,009
Yeah!

481
00:32:00,945 --> 00:32:05,663
My mom is the head of the cookie making department. She's been doing it for hundreds of years.

482
00:32:05,698 --> 00:32:09,063
Oh, what about a-a cookie delivery department?

483
00:32:09,579 --> 00:32:13,051
Or a special cookie delivery department. I'd vote for that.

484
00:32:13,051 --> 00:32:16,156
There's no voting! There's no special cookie delivery department!

485
00:32:16,191 --> 00:32:21,434
What about a special department for the special delivery of special cookies?

486
00:32:21,469 --> 00:32:22,136
(overlapping chatter) Yeah!

487
00:32:23,082 --> 00:32:39,027
All right, Teri, go and take these with you. Thanks. (exhales) Skip, report. Skip. Skip. Skip. Skip. (scoffs) Brother.

488
00:32:39,062 --> 00:32:40,830
She's a keeper.

489
00:32:40,865 --> 00:32:51,155
(over computer) Our new global partnership will allow you to expand your markets internationally. (into computer) You'll still get my personal attention, of course. (over computer) I'll just have more resources to bring your way. So what do you say?

490
00:32:51,190 --> 00:32:53,301
MCNEIL(into computer) That sounds great, you can count us in.

491
00:32:53,336 --> 00:32:58,427
(into computer) Terrific. I'll have Sandy send you the paperwork. And we will talk to you soon. (slight chuckle)

492
00:33:01,054 --> 00:33:02,885
Steady! S-Steady! (grunts)

493
00:33:05,632 --> 00:33:08,053
Yeah, no more video conferencing. (sighs)

494
00:33:29,029 --> 00:33:31,086
Hmm. Uh... Um... I-- No.

495
00:33:32,437 --> 00:33:33,719
Come on, Skip!

496
00:33:33,754 --> 00:33:37,343
Yeah-- Um, uh, uh, do you have any fives? (Note Skip thinks he is playing the children's card game "Go Fish.")

497
00:33:37,343 --> 00:33:38,816
Ooh! I have one.

498
00:33:38,851 --> 00:33:39,465
Oh yeah.

499
00:33:39,500 --> 00:33:43,431
No. No, no, Skip. It's poker, remember? Betting.

500
00:33:44,076 --> 00:33:53,461
All right, I bet you don't have any tens because I have four of them! Oh yeah! Oh yeah! Skip, ip, diddly-ip. (chuckles)

501
00:33:53,496 --> 00:33:54,045
Oh no!

502
00:33:54,080 --> 00:33:59,351
All right, all right, everybody give me your cards. Five-card stud, deuces wild.

503
00:33:59,386 --> 00:34:00,951
(exhales) Bring it on, double the ante.

504
00:34:01,727 --> 00:34:02,910
Ho, ho, ho. Here we go.

505
00:34:03,440 --> 00:34:04,753
Hey, Mr. C. What's going down?

506
00:34:04,788 --> 00:34:07,315
My rosy red cheeks in my rosy red chair. (Note humor that Santa responds to "what's going down?" as if it's not an expression of "how are you?" but to literally mean what's going down which he refers to his buttocks sitting down in the chair.)

507
00:34:07,980 --> 00:34:09,573
Dealer's choice, dear.

508
00:34:09,608 --> 00:34:10,243
Beautiful.

509
00:34:10,243 --> 00:34:10,948
Hi, everybody!

510
00:34:10,948 --> 00:34:11,650
There you go.

511
00:34:12,204 --> 00:34:12,692
(overlapping chatter) Hi, Teri.

512
00:34:12,727 --> 00:34:13,395
Hope I'm not interrupting anything.

513
00:34:13,430 --> 00:34:16,567
No, not at all. Just a friendly game here.

514
00:34:17,160 --> 00:34:18,257
Oh, you're playing cards.

515
00:34:18,641 --> 00:34:19,924
Uh, it-it looks like fun.

516
00:34:19,959 --> 00:34:24,280
Yeah! Y-You should play. There's an empty seat right here. Uh, next to me.

517
00:34:24,315 --> 00:34:26,090
Really? You don't mind?

518
00:34:26,554 --> 00:34:29,658
Well, uh, we were waiting for Mary.

519
00:34:29,693 --> 00:34:36,372
Uh, I just spoke with Mary. I don't think she's going to be able to make it. She is working so hard, bless her heart.

520
00:34:36,407 --> 00:34:41,630
Oh, it is such a busy time. It's hard to have fun and games when Christmas is at stake.

521
00:34:41,665 --> 00:34:43,351
Mm-hmm. Absolutely.

522
00:34:43,386 --> 00:34:53,389
Yeah, in her real life -- um, whatever that is -- something is going on with someone named Colin. Uh, I think. Oh! (clears throat)

523
00:34:57,288 --> 00:35:05,161
Okay, the game is Anchorage Anaconda. Suicide kings are wild, blood queen is dead, top the pot buys an extra card and first one out refills the chip bowl.

524
00:35:09,937 --> 00:35:10,641
Who's ready?

525
00:35:11,177 --> 00:35:16,164
Hey-o, hey-o. Who's ready? Who's ready? Come to mama, come to mama.

526
00:35:22,304 --> 00:35:24,006
(exhales) Boy, that was fun, huh?

527
00:35:24,041 --> 00:35:26,967
Oh, hey, Teri. Yeah. It s-sure was.

528
00:35:27,002 --> 00:35:31,427
Well, sorry to put a stop to your winning streak. Uh, beginner's luck, I guess.

529
00:35:31,462 --> 00:35:32,187
Yeah.

530
00:35:32,222 --> 00:35:36,260
Here, have a peanut butter cookie. They are my favorite.

531
00:35:39,753 --> 00:35:41,593
So how are things at the workshop?

532
00:35:42,101 --> 00:35:43,709
December sure is a busy month.

533
00:35:43,744 --> 00:35:47,166
(full mouth) Oh, it sure is! You know, that's when Christmas is.

534
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:54,045
(chuckles) It is! Oh. Tell me, Skip. Are you happy?

535
00:35:54,080 --> 00:35:55,108
Oh yeah.

536
00:35:55,143 --> 00:35:56,243
Really?

537
00:35:56,278 --> 00:35:57,492
Yep.

538
00:35:57,527 --> 00:36:01,372
I mean, are you really, really happy?

539
00:36:01,407 --> 00:36:07,045
Yeah. I'm like really, really happy. I'm really happy a lot. Yeah.

540
00:36:08,646 --> 00:36:20,403
Yeah, I'm sensing some hesitation in your voice. Maybe we should have a little chat. Get to the source of your problems.

541
00:36:20,438 --> 00:36:22,348
O-Okay.

542
00:36:22,383 --> 00:36:26,006
So, Skip, do the elves get overtime?

543
00:36:36,694 --> 00:36:37,733
Oh, Mary!

544
00:36:37,768 --> 00:36:39,037
Morning, Gary.

545
00:36:39,072 --> 00:36:42,765
Uh, morning. Uh, there's something -- kind of a big problem.

546
00:36:42,800 --> 00:36:44,973
Well, whatever it is, I'm sure we can handle it.

547
00:36:47,230 --> 00:36:48,164
What's this?

548
00:36:48,199 --> 00:36:50,021
It's our contract.

549
00:36:50,056 --> 00:36:52,141
Contract? What contract?

550
00:36:54,281 --> 00:36:55,671
Contract. See?

551
00:36:57,521 --> 00:36:59,441
Gary, what is he talking about?

552
00:36:59,476 --> 00:37:02,730
Oh, it-it's the deal we signed with Santa when we first got started.

553
00:37:02,765 --> 00:37:05,300
What does that have to do with me? Take it up with Santa.

554
00:37:05,335 --> 00:37:08,142
A-And since he's quitting, we get to regurgitate.

555
00:37:08,177 --> 00:37:10,152
Uh, renegotiate.

556
00:37:10,187 --> 00:37:14,447
Oh. (slight chuckle) Renegotiate. And we've got to change some things in the contract.

557
00:37:14,482 --> 00:37:16,655
That's what "renegotiate" means, Skip.

558
00:37:16,690 --> 00:37:19,794
(chuckles) Okay, then just that.

559
00:37:23,523 --> 00:37:25,530
Wait. (laughs)

560
00:37:30,938 --> 00:37:32,783
You-You had me.

561
00:37:37,680 --> 00:37:41,120
That was very (chuckles) funny. All right, I'm going to get back to work.

562
00:37:42,056 --> 00:37:48,942
Okay. Oh, oh-oh, yeah, right. Uh, you need to take us seriously. No contract, no toys.

563
00:38:06,802 --> 00:38:07,892
Dad, are you in here?

564
00:38:07,927 --> 00:38:09,982
Yeah, but I'm a little busy right now.

565
00:38:16,479 --> 00:38:17,362
Have you seen this?

566
00:38:17,397 --> 00:38:20,203
Yeah. Scrolls. We've had them around for many years.

567
00:38:20,238 --> 00:38:21,757
It's the elves' contract.

568
00:38:21,792 --> 00:38:25,117
Well, that old thing? (chuckles) Good for them, they still have it.

569
00:38:25,152 --> 00:38:32,239
Good for them? Bad for us. ... Daddy, have you even read it?

570
00:38:32,274 --> 00:38:33,134
Read it? I wrote it.

571
00:38:33,169 --> 00:38:38,076
It's a complete mess. Half of it doesn't even make sense and the other half is in Old English.

572
00:38:38,111 --> 00:38:40,020
At the time, we just called it English.

573
00:38:40,055 --> 00:38:42,642
Well, I can't use this, I have to start from scratch.

574
00:38:42,677 --> 00:38:54,226
Honey, they're elves. All you have to do is give them a couple of cookies, point them towards something shiny, and they'll forget all about it. You have to learn how to negotiate.

575
00:38:54,261 --> 00:38:57,265
I know how to negotiate. I have an MBA from Wharton.

576
00:38:57,300 --> 00:38:58,883
Well, then it shouldn't be a problem.

577
00:38:58,918 --> 00:39:01,745
It isn't my problem, it's your problem.

578
00:39:02,289 --> 00:39:04,826
They're your elves, you should be the one handling this.

579
00:39:04,861 --> 00:39:06,271
Not anymore, I'm retired.

580
00:39:09,275 --> 00:39:13,892
Honey, if this is getting to be too much to handle, why don't you ask Teri to help you?

581
00:39:22,359 --> 00:39:23,531
(gasps) Hi!

582
00:39:23,566 --> 00:39:25,635
Hi, Gary! (chuckles) Hello, Mary!

583
00:39:25,670 --> 00:39:28,869
All right, let's get down to business. You have your list of demands?

584
00:39:31,379 --> 00:39:35,379
Number one, we want a twenty percent raise across the board.

585
00:39:35,414 --> 00:39:36,564
1. 20% RAISE 2. Get Paid 3. Store to spend money

586
00:39:36,564 --> 00:39:37,487
(overlapping chatter) Oh. Oh, yeah. Ooh!

587
00:39:37,522 --> 00:39:39,801
You don't get paid. Twenty percent of nothing is still nothing.

588
00:39:39,836 --> 00:39:41,872
Ah, number two, we want to get paid.

589
00:39:43,679 --> 00:39:45,406
What do you need money for anyway?

590
00:39:45,441 --> 00:39:48,851
Number three, we want our own store where we can spend our money.

591
00:39:48,886 --> 00:39:50,132
(overlapping chatter) Yeah, yeah, yeah!

592
00:39:50,167 --> 00:39:53,476
Okay, can we just skip past the money part and hear the rest of your demands?

593
00:39:53,511 --> 00:39:54,068
(paper)4. Credit

594
00:39:54,103 --> 00:39:54,509
union

595
00:39:54,509 --> 00:39:56,740
Um, okay, uh, credit union.

596
00:39:56,775 --> 00:39:57,100
What?

597
00:39:57,135 --> 00:40:00,406
Monopoly. Monopoly money... Ah, cookies.

598
00:40:01,510 --> 00:40:04,123
You get cookies. All the cookies you want.

599
00:40:04,158 --> 00:40:06,691
Oh yeah, but we want cookies with sprinkles.

600
00:40:06,726 --> 00:40:08,708
(overlapping chatter) Yeah! Absolutely.

601
00:40:09,859 --> 00:40:11,883
The cookies have sprinkles.

602
00:40:11,918 --> 00:40:13,740
On top and bottom.

603
00:40:13,775 --> 00:40:15,837
Ooh, that sounds good.

604
00:40:15,872 --> 00:40:27,067
Oh! And we want those, uh, hats with the cups for cocoa. Trampolines at the workstation. And jet packs. And everybody gets their own chipmunk. Hey, little guy. (kisses)

605
00:40:28,787 --> 00:40:29,559
Enough!

606
00:40:32,215 --> 00:40:48,270
No. Nope. Never going to happen. (chuckles) Not a chance in hell. Nada. Never! (chuckles) Huh. One break every six hours. Take it or leave it.

607
00:40:51,264 --> 00:40:52,295
That went well.

608
00:40:52,330 --> 00:40:53,612
Gary!

609
00:40:53,647 --> 00:40:54,381
Huh?

610
00:40:54,416 --> 00:40:55,692
We're storming out.

611
00:40:55,727 --> 00:40:56,670
Me too?

612
00:40:56,705 --> 00:40:58,045
Yeah.

613
00:40:59,005 --> 00:41:00,843
Okay. Bye!

614
00:41:00,878 --> 00:41:02,971
(overlapping chatter) Uh, bye! Oh hey, bye, Gary! Take care.

615
00:41:08,967 --> 00:41:09,705
(sighs)  What?

616
00:41:11,023 --> 00:41:13,825
Mary? I'm sorry, did I (over phone) catch you at a bad time?

617
00:41:13,860 --> 00:41:17,561
Colin! No, no, no. Of course not. I'm so glad to hear from you.

618
00:41:17,596 --> 00:41:22,001
(over phone) I just wanted to check in and  see how your client retention efforts are coming.

619
00:41:22,036 --> 00:41:28,009
Well, I'm-- They are coming along fine. I just have a few hands to hold through the merger.

620
00:41:28,044 --> 00:41:34,207
(over phone) Good. It's  vital you're able to meet the numbers we discussed if I'm going to be able to convince the board to vote for the merger.

621
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:38,329
Well, I will not let you down. (slight chuckle) (to Gary) (whispers) Go away.

622
00:41:38,364 --> 00:41:39,842
(gasps) Oh, why didn't you say so?

623
00:41:39,877 --> 00:41:45,732
(over phone) Mary, this thing could still fall apart.  I'm afraid nothing's guaranteed at this point. (over phone) We are all relying on you.

624
00:41:45,767 --> 00:41:46,923
How's she doing?

625
00:41:46,958 --> 00:41:49,332
Oh, I think she's in trouble with her boss. (chuckles)

626
00:41:49,367 --> 00:41:52,780
(chuckles) Oh, kind of like how you're in trouble with the elves?

627
00:41:52,815 --> 00:41:54,094
What?

628
00:41:54,129 --> 00:41:58,846
You know, how they all hate you because you're siding with Mary instead of your friends.

629
00:42:00,222 --> 00:42:00,974
Hate me?

630
00:42:01,009 --> 00:42:06,276
Oh don't worry about it. Three hundred years from now, who's going to remember who betrayed who, right?

631
00:42:07,782 --> 00:42:09,713
Uh, y-you mean all of them?

632
00:42:09,748 --> 00:42:13,922
Well, I haven't heard back from Hillard Corp., but (over phone) I know they love me.

633
00:42:13,957 --> 00:42:20,458
Well, I'm afraid the board is looking for signatures right now, Mary, not love. (over phone) Got it?  Can you give me a time estimate on any of this?

634
00:42:22,954 --> 00:42:27,840
Hello? Mary? Hello? Are you there?

635
00:42:31,032 --> 00:42:34,532
ÝËÜÔ
Hey, Luke! Hi.

636
00:42:40,381 --> 00:42:42,624
H-Hey, there you are! I've been looking for you.

637
00:42:42,659 --> 00:42:43,298
Hey, baby.

638
00:42:43,333 --> 00:42:44,539
I've been crazed!

639
00:42:44,574 --> 00:42:45,531
Everything all right?

640
00:42:45,566 --> 00:42:50,787
Yeah, of course. Everything's fine. What's with the, uh, mail bag? You moonlighting now?

641
00:42:51,292 --> 00:42:53,894
(chuckles) No. Teri's letting me help out a bit.

642
00:42:55,312 --> 00:42:56,763
Teri, huh?

643
00:42:56,798 --> 00:42:58,411
Uh, yeah.

644
00:42:58,446 --> 00:43:02,269
You know, I'd be careful around her if I were you.

645
00:43:03,708 --> 00:43:05,263
What's that supposed to mean?

646
00:43:07,251 --> 00:43:11,904
I don't know. She just seems naughty to me.

647
00:43:11,939 --> 00:43:21,334
Oh, come on. Teri's great. Well, I-- You know me. I just like being a little part of Christmas, is all.

648
00:43:22,983 --> 00:43:28,431
(chuckles) Well, that makes one of us. I just can't wait to go back home. (chuckles) Right?

649
00:43:28,466 --> 00:43:32,505
Yeah, right. It's just...

650
00:43:33,760 --> 00:43:38,874
Luke, we can't stay here. My life, my business -- everything is-is in the city!

651
00:43:38,909 --> 00:43:47,850
Yeah, I know. Y-You know what? This isn't a good time. You have a lot of work to do and... We can talk about this later. (kiss)

652
00:43:53,764 --> 00:43:54,756
(sighs) What else can go wrong?

653
00:43:54,791 --> 00:43:57,074
What do we want?

654
00:43:57,109 --> 00:43:57,822
Cookies!

655
00:43:57,857 --> 00:43:58,990
When do we want them?

656
00:43:59,025 --> 00:43:59,767
Now!

657
00:43:59,802 --> 00:44:08,428
(chant) Hey, hey, hey, ho, ho, ho. Mary Claus has got to go. Hey, hey, hey, ho, ho, ho. Mary Claus has got to go.

658
00:44:08,463 --> 00:44:08,871
(signs)HOHOHO 'S GOT TO GO Cookies for all!

659
00:44:08,906 --> 00:44:09,904
What do we want?

660
00:44:09,939 --> 00:44:11,532
Cookies!

661
00:44:11,567 --> 00:44:12,155
When do we want them?

662
00:44:12,190 --> 00:44:12,859
Now!

663
00:44:14,283 --> 00:44:15,019
(chuckles) What do we want?

664
00:44:15,054 --> 00:44:15,787
What?

665
00:44:18,258 --> 00:44:19,584
And what do we want?

666
00:44:19,619 --> 00:44:20,434
Cookies!

667
00:44:20,469 --> 00:44:21,643
When do we want them?

668
00:44:21,678 --> 00:44:22,428
Now!

669
00:44:22,463 --> 00:44:28,349
You have cookies! They're inside! Wait. (scoffs) What the hell is going on here?

670
00:44:29,864 --> 00:44:31,480
It's a picket line. It's sort of like "Follow the Leader."

671
00:44:31,515 --> 00:44:36,274
Yeah, I know what it is. Are you serious? You're going on strike at Christmas?

672
00:44:36,309 --> 00:44:38,308
You didn't really give us much choice.

673
00:44:38,343 --> 00:44:41,460
"Us"? Gary, we're supposed to be on the same team.

674
00:44:41,495 --> 00:44:44,737
I can't just abandon my fellow elves. They look up to me.

675
00:44:44,772 --> 00:44:48,267
It's true. He's the tallest. See? Right there.

676
00:44:48,302 --> 00:44:55,802
(scoffs) This is ridiculous! All right, listen. Everyone, put down your signs and go back to work!

677
00:44:59,767 --> 00:45:01,873
Uh-uh-uh-uh. We didn't say "Gary says."

678
00:45:05,223 --> 00:45:09,925
They can't go back to work until we talk about the list of demands.

679
00:45:09,960 --> 00:45:10,725
No!

680
00:45:10,760 --> 00:45:11,327
Yes.

681
00:45:11,362 --> 00:45:18,831
No! I can't deal with this! You guys are on strike, my dad's on vacation! I'm just going to have to do everything myself!

682
00:45:22,568 --> 00:45:31,291
No ifs, no buts! We want candy, we want nuts! No ifs, no buts! We want candy, we want nuts!

683
00:45:44,297 --> 00:45:47,180
All right, how hard can this be? (grunts with effort)

684
00:46:44,405 --> 00:46:46,052
Howdy, Luke.

685
00:46:46,087 --> 00:46:47,300
Oh, hey, Teri.

686
00:46:47,335 --> 00:46:48,819
What you looking for?

687
00:46:48,854 --> 00:46:55,292
(sighs) Mary's been going through some stuff and I figured I'd make her some coffee. I-I can't find the cookies, though.

688
00:46:55,327 --> 00:46:57,724
Well, you know how hungry those elves are. (slight chuckle)

689
00:46:57,759 --> 00:46:58,692
Oh, I know.

690
00:46:58,727 --> 00:47:01,972
Maybe we could whip up a batch ourselves.

691
00:47:02,007 --> 00:47:04,803
Oh, no, no, no, no, no. (chuckles) I'm not very good in the kitchen.

692
00:47:04,838 --> 00:47:07,779
Come on, Luke. Let's dive in.

693
00:47:21,055 --> 00:47:22,216
Um, we need flour. (slight chuckle)

694
00:47:56,109 --> 00:47:56,938
There we go.

695
00:48:09,464 --> 00:48:10,554
(heavy breaths)  Mary Class.

696
00:48:10,589 --> 00:48:12,234
Mary! Where have you been?

697
00:48:12,269 --> 00:48:16,217
Sorry. I haven't been in touch, I've been in crisis mode up here.

698
00:48:16,252 --> 00:48:21,194
(over phone) If it is crisis mode up there, it is Armageddon down here.  We've lost Gadgetech and Patterson Pharmaceuticals.

699
00:48:21,229 --> 00:48:24,405
Lost them? I thought my meeting with them wasn't until next week.

700
00:48:24,440 --> 00:48:31,307
(over phone) This is next week!  It's hard to convince a company (over phone) you're going to give them hands-on attention when you're  rescheduling a conference call for the third time.

701
00:48:31,342 --> 00:48:32,494
Well, where does that leave us now?

702
00:48:32,529 --> 00:48:39,485
(over phone) At this point?  You, me and about seven clients. Not exactly merger bait. I'm almost at the office. If you've got any (over phone) tricks left up your sleeve, now's the time.

703
00:48:39,520 --> 00:48:41,183
(exhales) All right I'm on it.

704
00:48:56,795 --> 00:48:58,888
Okay, guys. See you next time.

705
00:48:58,923 --> 00:48:59,672
ÕÈÏÏÈÀ
Later, Nick.

706
00:48:59,707 --> 00:49:01,234
ÕÈÏÏÈÁ
Yeah, later, brother!

707
00:49:04,110 --> 00:49:05,443
Everybody having fun?

708
00:49:05,478 --> 00:49:06,467
Oh yeah, you bet! (chuckles)

709
00:49:06,502 --> 00:49:10,602
Dad! Where have you been? The elves have gone nuts!

710
00:49:10,637 --> 00:49:14,419
I was at my drum circle, getting in touch with the sacred masculine.

711
00:49:14,454 --> 00:49:26,171
The sacred what? All right, I have been more than patient, but enough is enough! My life is falling apart because you bailed on Christmas! You've had plenty of time to explore this other side of you.

712
00:49:26,206 --> 00:49:28,029
What other side? This is all me.

713
00:49:28,064 --> 00:49:36,028
No, it's not you! The last month has been crazy time in Santa town. I need you to just stop it and just fix Christmas.

714
00:49:38,429 --> 00:49:39,125
Wait, wait.

715
00:49:43,728 --> 00:49:44,319
What's going on?

716
00:49:44,354 --> 00:49:45,769
What have you two been up to?

717
00:49:45,804 --> 00:49:53,426
(laughs) Teri and I, we were in the kitchen. Um, um, I made you some cookies.

718
00:49:54,784 --> 00:50:05,175
Mary, I know this is difficult to understand, but when I started out I had no one to help me. You're going to have to learn how to walk on your own two feet if you're going to replace me.

719
00:50:05,210 --> 00:50:12,040
You're not listening. I don't want to replace you. I don't want to be Santa Claus!

720
00:50:18,654 --> 00:50:20,472
Òàêñè.

721
00:50:23,385 --> 00:50:24,114
So you're really going?

722
00:50:24,149 --> 00:50:28,844
If I don't leave right away, my business and everything I've worked my whole life for will be gone.

723
00:50:28,879 --> 00:50:29,865
And Christmas?

724
00:50:29,900 --> 00:50:37,033
(exhales) Leaving is the only thing that's going to snap my father back to reality. (exhales) Where's your luggage?

725
00:50:40,745 --> 00:50:44,676
Look, Mary. Up here I have a life.

726
00:50:47,195 --> 00:50:55,987
It-It's not much in the grand scheme of things, but it's my life. I have my friends and my dog sledding business and my house. Back in New York all I have is...

727
00:50:57,088 --> 00:50:57,984
Me?

728
00:51:01,301 --> 00:51:05,547
(exhales) Mary, I love you and I want to be with you. Here.

729
00:51:07,506 --> 00:51:10,827
(sighs) I can't give up what I love and what I love to do.

730
00:51:10,862 --> 00:51:12,549
I know.

731
00:51:12,584 --> 00:51:16,822
So, no matter where we are, someone's going to be unhappy.

732
00:51:16,857 --> 00:51:18,606
We can work this out, right?

733
00:51:18,641 --> 00:51:37,080
I don't know. I don't know, Luke. I know you always say that things work out at Christmas, but that's just one day out of the year.

734
00:51:52,784 --> 00:51:53,946
I'll see you later.

735
00:52:32,270 --> 00:52:39,626
(exhales) Honey, I'm home! (exhales) Such as it is. (sighs)

736
00:53:01,004 --> 00:53:03,266
I know, buddy. I miss her too.

737
00:53:21,656 --> 00:53:22,671
Ñòîé!

738
00:54:38,826 --> 00:54:39,759
Am I interrupting?

739
00:54:41,833 --> 00:54:43,488
Teri! What are you doing here?

740
00:54:43,523 --> 00:54:49,504
Well, I-I couldn't find you anywhere. And these brownies just came out of the oven.

741
00:54:51,255 --> 00:54:53,729
I, uh, I just needed to get some air.

742
00:54:53,764 --> 00:54:56,171
Well, I hope you have room for a brownie.

743
00:54:57,698 --> 00:54:59,569
(exhales) (slight chuckle) No, I'm not really hungry right n--

744
00:54:59,604 --> 00:55:01,783
(interrupts) Oh, go on, Luke. You look like you could use it.

745
00:55:01,818 --> 00:55:12,272
(exhales) All right. (full mouth) Wow. Wow.

746
00:55:12,307 --> 00:55:17,720
(chuckles) You see, Luke. There is no problem in life that can't be solved with a plate full of brownies.

747
00:55:17,755 --> 00:55:19,740
Mm. That'd be nice.

748
00:55:25,364 --> 00:55:34,619
It is lovely here, isn't it? Like nowhere else in the world. What's it like in that big city of yours?

749
00:55:36,318 --> 00:55:40,990
Crowded, noisy, and the traffic is terrible.

750
00:55:43,350 --> 00:55:44,795
Ooh. Must be nice for you to get away from it all.

751
00:55:46,736 --> 00:55:48,054
It's not all that bad. (slight chuckle)

752
00:55:52,166 --> 00:56:12,165
You know, Luke, maybe you shouldn't try forcing things with Mary. I mean, she-she has her life and you can have yours too. Maybe everything you need is-is already here. Right in front of you.

753
00:56:16,445 --> 00:56:17,240
Really?

754
00:56:17,275 --> 00:56:28,633
You need someone who appreciates you for you, Luke. Someone who shares your interests. Who'll always be there for you.

755
00:56:32,848 --> 00:56:37,974
(exhales) You're so right, Teri. Mary's gone. She went back to the city.

756
00:56:39,961 --> 00:56:41,110
Mary's gone?

757
00:56:41,145 --> 00:56:42,251
Uh-huh.

758
00:56:49,570 --> 00:56:50,318
Teri?

759
00:56:52,583 --> 00:56:53,903
Wahoo!

760
00:57:15,818 --> 00:57:23,572
Mary, I don't want to step on your toes, but I have an idea-- Mary?

761
00:57:28,438 --> 00:57:29,918
Oh. Where's Mary?

762
00:57:44,746 --> 00:57:46,818
I can't believe she'd let me down like this.

763
00:57:46,853 --> 00:58:01,550
Let you down? Nicholas, did you ever stop to consider that Mary might be right? While you've been wasting time, she's been here, sacrificing, doing your job, to keep Christmas going.

764
00:58:01,585 --> 00:58:03,310
But I've been going through some things.

765
00:58:05,061 --> 00:58:11,254
(chuckles) How many times have I heard that? (chuckles) I remember when you just had to have that Viking longboat. (chuckles)

766
00:58:13,009 --> 00:58:14,487
(chuckles) It came with its own Vikings.

767
00:58:14,522 --> 00:58:19,041
Uh, yeah, and it took me a decade to get the stains out of the carpet. (laughs)

768
00:58:23,904 --> 00:58:31,039
Oh Nicholas, I just wish you'd stop this foolishness and get back to work. Before the children pay the price.

769
00:58:39,290 --> 00:58:46,283
(chant) Half the work and twice the play, we want cocoa every day! Half the work and twice the play, we want cocoa--

770
00:58:46,318 --> 00:58:52,195
Good news, elves! It's all over! Time to go back to work!

771
00:58:58,725 --> 00:59:00,020
What about the strike?

772
00:59:00,638 --> 00:59:03,833
The strike is over, Skip! Congratulations, you won!

773
00:59:04,177 --> 00:59:06,319
But-But-But what did Mary say?

774
00:59:08,360 --> 00:59:15,574
Good question, Gary. Anyone else have any other questions? No? Okay, back to work.

775
00:59:15,609 --> 00:59:17,178
But-But-But what about Mary?

776
00:59:17,213 --> 00:59:24,034
All right, who wants to sit around asking questions?

777
00:59:24,069 --> 00:59:25,386
(overlapping chatter) Not me! Not here. Uh-uh.

778
00:59:27,850 --> 00:59:34,009
And who wants to make some toys?

779
00:59:34,044 --> 00:59:36,279
(overlapping chatter) Yay! Oh yeah!

780
00:59:36,314 --> 00:59:47,400
That's what I'm talking about! Now let's get cracking because we have a lot of catching up to do. But first, give yourselves a hand.

781
00:59:49,754 --> 00:59:51,763
Teri! C-Can I talk to Mary?

782
00:59:51,798 --> 00:59:58,339
(sighs) I'm afraid Mary has left to pursue other interests.

783
01:00:34,912 --> 01:00:43,828
Èäó ... Colin? What are you doing here? Come on in.

784
01:00:43,863 --> 01:00:44,439
Thank you.

785
01:00:44,474 --> 01:00:45,585
I thought we were meeting tomorrow.

786
01:00:45,620 --> 01:00:52,007
We are. But I've been chatting up the board members informally. We're all terribly impressed with how you've turned this thing around.

787
01:00:53,353 --> 01:00:58,212
So the meeting tomorrow will just be a formality really. Congratulations.

788
01:00:58,247 --> 01:01:01,638
Colin, that's fantastic!

789
01:01:01,673 --> 01:01:03,919
I hope I'm not imposing, but I couldn't wait to tell you.

790
01:01:04,789 --> 01:01:07,726
Where's that charming boyfriend of yours? What was it, Bo?

791
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:09,783
Luke.

792
01:01:09,818 --> 01:01:11,757
Luke, right, sorry. (slight chuckle)

793
01:01:13,031 --> 01:01:16,431
Yeah, he's not in the, uh, picture. I think.

794
01:01:18,680 --> 01:01:22,783
Oh. I'm sorry to hear that. Well, perhaps these will cheer you up.

795
01:01:26,105 --> 01:01:27,003
What's all this?

796
01:01:27,038 --> 01:01:28,644
The merger papers.

797
01:01:30,467 --> 01:01:31,260
But I--

798
01:01:31,295 --> 01:01:34,042
(interrupts) I had them ready weeks ago. I knew you could do it. (slight chuckle)

799
01:01:37,665 --> 01:01:41,278
Now all that's needed is your Jane Hancock, shall we say?

800
01:01:50,644 --> 01:01:51,278
Problem?

801
01:01:51,313 --> 01:02:03,117
No, no, I just-- I worked towards this moment my whole career, so now that it's finally here, it just... Well, it seems, um...

802
01:02:05,692 --> 01:02:06,628
Wonderful?

803
01:02:08,676 --> 01:02:09,571
Something like that. (exhales)

804
01:02:13,990 --> 01:02:19,949
And with a stroke of the quill, Whitmore-Class is born. Will you join me in a toast?

805
01:02:21,454 --> 01:02:22,384
Uh, sure!

806
01:02:26,782 --> 01:02:27,424
Ta-da!

807
01:02:30,025 --> 01:02:30,781
Thank you.

808
01:02:30,816 --> 01:02:31,853
My pleasure.

809
01:02:35,053 --> 01:02:39,592
To Mary Class. May all of her Christmas wishes come true.

810
01:02:39,627 --> 01:02:40,512
Thank you.

811
01:02:44,549 --> 01:02:50,489
Now, I hope I'm not being presumptuous, but I've made reservations tonight at Gianelli's. If you're available.

812
01:02:50,524 --> 01:02:51,560
With the whole team?

813
01:02:51,595 --> 01:02:55,022
No. I thought it might just be the two of us.

814
01:03:00,220 --> 01:03:01,733
(exhales) That would be nice.

815
01:03:01,768 --> 01:03:02,982
Lovely.

816
01:03:10,079 --> 01:03:11,898
Dave, fast. Uh, faster.

817
01:03:18,409 --> 01:03:20,155
Uh, too squeaky.

818
01:03:24,202 --> 01:03:24,863
Lucy.

819
01:03:24,898 --> 01:03:25,771
Mm-hmm?

820
01:03:27,234 --> 01:03:28,323
What color is this?

821
01:03:28,358 --> 01:03:29,060
Pink.

822
01:03:29,095 --> 01:03:31,557
Oh. A-And this one?

823
01:03:31,592 --> 01:03:32,161
Blue.

824
01:03:32,196 --> 01:03:35,611
Right. And you don't see a problem here? (chuckles)

825
01:03:35,646 --> 01:03:36,908
Nope!

826
01:03:38,351 --> 01:03:45,436
Ah! Lucy, the ribbons in the hair must match, please. Um, fix them. Okay? Fix them all. Skip? Skip! Skip!

827
01:03:45,471 --> 01:03:46,341
Yeah, boss?

828
01:03:46,376 --> 01:03:49,257
Don't sneak up on me like that.

829
01:03:49,727 --> 01:03:51,316
I'm back!

830
01:03:51,351 --> 01:03:52,730
(overlapping chatter) Santa! Yay!

831
01:03:52,765 --> 01:03:53,215
Santa!

832
01:03:55,131 --> 01:04:01,281
Nick! Hey, Nick. Nice to see you. Uh, just stopping by for a visit?

833
01:04:01,316 --> 01:04:01,699
(chuckles) Hi.

834
01:04:01,734 --> 01:04:04,315
No, not a visit. Mary's gone back to New York.

835
01:04:04,350 --> 01:04:11,116
Yeah, so I have heard. Which is why I have taken control. No need for you to worry, I think I hear the golf course calling your name.

836
01:04:11,151 --> 01:04:20,826
Well, I appreciate the help, but I got it from here. The big man is back. Gary! Where's my Gary? There you are. Gary, situation report.

837
01:04:20,861 --> 01:04:21,330
We got--

838
01:04:21,365 --> 01:04:26,927
(interrupts) Uh, we a-are right at the end. I-It's Christmas Eve tomorrow. (slight chuckle) We're almost done. I'm just putting on the finishing touches.

839
01:04:26,962 --> 01:04:35,983
All right, that means the toys are done. But that's only half. The rest is the deliveries. And that's the magic, that's what makes Christmas happen.

840
01:04:37,142 --> 01:04:39,424
But you weren't even here when we made the toys.

841
01:04:39,459 --> 01:04:41,573
Does that mean I'm not allowed to deliver them?

842
01:04:42,957 --> 01:04:46,693
No, but-- (exhales) But I was going to do that.

843
01:04:49,922 --> 01:04:52,317
But you let Mary deliver the toys last year.

844
01:04:52,352 --> 01:05:04,917
Teri, you've been a good assistant and I appreciate the help. But I am Santa Claus and Mary is my daughter. That's who we are. Just as you are the mail carrier. And that's what you should be doing, you do it so well.

845
01:05:04,952 --> 01:05:06,637
Oh... W--

846
01:05:12,058 --> 01:05:19,127
Santa Claus. Pardon me, but may I borrow you for just a moment? In the other room? Alone?

847
01:05:19,162 --> 01:05:20,052
All right.

848
01:05:20,525 --> 01:05:21,420
I'll be right back.

849
01:05:30,216 --> 01:05:32,759
ÒÅÐÈ
We wish you a Teri Christmas

850
01:05:32,794 --> 01:05:35,176
We wish you a Teri Christmas

851
01:05:35,211 --> 01:05:39,841
And a happy new year

852
01:05:48,340 --> 01:05:49,596
(chuckles) Ah, thanks for a great night.

853
01:05:51,373 --> 01:05:52,049
I had a lovely time.

854
01:05:52,084 --> 01:05:54,425
I'm just glad we can put it on your expense account.

855
01:05:55,265 --> 01:05:58,132
Well, with the merger, my expense account is your expense account.

856
01:05:58,167 --> 01:06:01,435
Crap, I hadn't thought about that. Is it too late to get out of it?

857
01:06:01,470 --> 01:06:02,572
I'm afraid so.

858
01:06:02,607 --> 01:06:04,843
Well, I'm going to call my lawyer in the morning. (chuckles)

859
01:06:14,920 --> 01:06:15,694
Is something wrong?

860
01:06:17,446 --> 01:06:24,778
Sharing letterhead is going to be a big enough adjustment already. I just can't handle anything else right now.

861
01:06:26,007 --> 01:06:27,140
I understand.

862
01:06:29,308 --> 01:06:33,012
Thank you. See you Monday?

863
01:06:33,047 --> 01:06:38,586
Absolutely. Oh, and have a merry Christmas.

864
01:06:38,621 --> 01:06:40,567
That's what they all say.

865
01:06:40,602 --> 01:06:42,015
I beg your pardon?

866
01:06:42,050 --> 01:06:43,766
Never mind. Good night.

867
01:06:43,801 --> 01:06:44,627
Good night.

868
01:07:02,929 --> 01:07:08,654
This is a big one, look. (chuckle) Wow. Last one in is a (indistinct) Snowball! Ooh, cool! Higher, higher!

869
01:07:25,908 --> 01:07:26,727
Teri.

870
01:07:44,555 --> 01:07:45,388
Teri, can I have a cookie?

871
01:07:45,423 --> 01:07:49,405
Oh, I'm sorry. Um, Santa said I should be the only one eating cookies.

872
01:07:49,440 --> 01:07:51,003
But it's just usually--

873
01:07:51,038 --> 01:07:52,131
(interrupts) You question the will of Santa?

874
01:07:52,166 --> 01:07:52,885
No.

875
01:07:52,920 --> 01:07:54,943
Back to work. (chomps) (slight chuckle)

876
01:08:02,447 --> 01:08:06,031
Oh, looks like somebody's getting an extra chunk of potato. I hope you don't mind.

877
01:08:09,566 --> 01:08:13,725
Now, I don't want any complaints, okay? I put in basil because I happen to like basil.

878
01:08:13,726 --> 01:08:30,220
And I don't see you doing any of the cooking around here. ... Dig in. ... You know, it's really nice having someone to eat with.

879
01:08:34,939 --> 01:08:38,387
Mary! Wow! You're back!

880
01:08:41,263 --> 01:08:47,812
Okay, we'll have plenty of time for that later. Listen, we need to get to the workshop. I think my dad's in trouble. I'll explain later.

881
01:08:47,847 --> 01:08:49,565
All right, let's-let's go.

882
01:08:57,463 --> 01:08:59,421
All right, you can have mine.

883
01:09:08,478 --> 01:09:09,202
See you!

884
01:09:14,383 --> 01:09:23,354
Okay, everyone. Tonight is the big night. Let's get these last few toys on the sleigh and get ready to make Santa proud! (laughs)

885
01:09:24,878 --> 01:09:25,750
(overlapping chatter) Sure. All right.

886
01:09:27,527 --> 01:09:33,509
(laughs) Skip? (clears throat) Skip! Skip, w-where were you? Did you finish hanging my portrait?

887
01:09:33,544 --> 01:09:34,380
I was just--

888
01:09:34,415 --> 01:09:38,460
(interrupts) (scoffs) It-It doesn't matter. Look, I really need you to get on this thing and I'm telling you--

889
01:09:38,495 --> 01:09:39,592
(interrupts) All right, the jig's up!

890
01:09:41,157 --> 01:09:44,393
Mary. You're back. Oh joy.

891
01:09:44,428 --> 01:09:47,689
Yeah, I'm back. Phoebe!

892
01:09:48,241 --> 01:09:52,048
She's an elf! You're an elf!

893
01:09:52,083 --> 01:09:55,776
You figured it out. Good for you.

894
01:09:56,768 --> 01:09:59,444
Well, guess I don't need these anymore.

895
01:10:00,582 --> 01:10:01,355
Or these.

896
01:10:04,820 --> 01:10:06,144
And what about the outfit?

897
01:10:06,179 --> 01:10:16,616
My uniform? Oh, no, no, no. I think I'll keep it. After all, Santa did put me in charge. Right, everyone?

898
01:10:16,651 --> 01:10:17,799
(overlapping chatter) Mm-hmm. Yeah.

899
01:10:17,834 --> 01:10:18,815
He did no such thing.

900
01:10:19,732 --> 01:10:20,385
Um, Skip?

901
01:10:20,420 --> 01:10:28,914
Oh yeah, Santa went away. He said that Teri's in charge. He said that Teri is the new Santa. He gave Teri the suit and the sleigh and the workshop.

902
01:10:28,949 --> 01:10:29,897
Went away where?

903
01:10:29,932 --> 01:10:31,373
Oh, oh, I don't know, um--

904
01:10:31,408 --> 01:10:33,979
(interrupts) Oh who knows? Probably on one of his crazy flights of fancy.

905
01:10:34,014 --> 01:10:34,649
Yeah.

906
01:10:34,684 --> 01:10:36,307
That kind of thing runs in the family

907
01:10:38,503 --> 01:10:40,499
(scoffs) Gary, can you tell me what really happened?

908
01:10:40,534 --> 01:10:46,972
Santa went away. He said Teri's in charge. He said Teri's the new Santa. He gave Teri the suit, the sleigh and the workshop.

909
01:10:47,007 --> 01:10:47,867
(overlapping chatter) Yeah.

910
01:10:47,902 --> 01:10:49,898
Santa told you Teri is in charge?

911
01:10:49,933 --> 01:10:51,458
Well, no.

912
01:10:51,493 --> 01:10:57,968
Uh, uh, uh, wait a second. Did anyone actually hear Santa say Teri was in charge?

913
01:10:58,003 --> 01:10:58,705
(overlapping chatter) No. Uh...

914
01:10:59,773 --> 01:11:01,138
So, who told you?

915
01:11:01,173 --> 01:11:01,823
& Teri.

916
01:11:03,698 --> 01:11:07,773
And it didn't occur to anyone that maybe she was lying?

917
01:11:09,121 --> 01:11:13,159
But if Teri is lying, why would Santa put her in charge? (slight chuckle) It's--

918
01:11:14,466 --> 01:11:21,190
She said her name was Teri, but it's really Phoebe. She said she was a mailman, but she's really an elf.

919
01:11:28,458 --> 01:11:29,868
(gasps) You're a liar!

920
01:11:30,372 --> 01:11:33,635
I bet Santa never even said you could have all the cookies!

921
01:11:33,670 --> 01:11:35,979
I bet Santa didn't put you in charge at all!

922
01:11:36,014 --> 01:11:40,579
Well, well, well. Looks like we got ourselves a little rebellion.

923
01:11:43,107 --> 01:11:44,875
You know what I have to say to that?

924
01:11:44,910 --> 01:11:45,859
What?

925
01:11:45,894 --> 01:11:48,244
Free cookies!

926
01:12:11,946 --> 01:12:12,705
What is this doing here?

927
01:12:12,740 --> 01:12:15,441
Well, it's a present. We do deliver them, you know. (bites)

928
01:12:15,476 --> 01:12:17,537
It's a little big, don't you think?

929
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:23,307
"Do not open until after Christmas."

930
01:12:34,534 --> 01:12:36,546
Mom, Dad!

931
01:12:40,239 --> 01:12:41,819
Mr. and Mrs. C, are you all right?

932
01:12:43,940 --> 01:12:45,787
Oh! Oh, thank goodness! (breathes heavily)

933
01:12:45,822 --> 01:12:47,420
Teri is naughty.

934
01:12:47,455 --> 01:12:54,514
Yeah, we got that. And her name isn't Teri. It's Phoebe. And I'll bet you fifty bucks that's why I didn't get your letter.

935
01:12:54,549 --> 01:12:55,418
Of course.

936
01:12:56,697 --> 01:12:57,489
How could I have missed that?

937
01:12:57,524 --> 01:12:58,328
It was the hair.

938
01:12:58,808 --> 01:12:59,909
And the glasses.

939
01:13:00,479 --> 01:13:04,079
No, it was me. I was so much into my own nonsense, now look what happened.

940
01:13:04,114 --> 01:13:05,501
Oh, no. There, there, dear.

941
01:13:05,536 --> 01:13:08,201
I know what you're going to say. You're going to say, "Nicholas, don't blame yourself."

942
01:13:08,236 --> 01:13:10,009
No, I wasn't going to say that.

943
01:13:10,044 --> 01:13:10,809
You weren't?

944
01:13:10,844 --> 01:13:11,465
No.

945
01:13:11,500 --> 01:13:12,983
Uh, guys?

946
01:13:12,983 --> 01:13:13,399
The sleigh's gone.

947
01:13:13,452 --> 01:13:14,233
All right.

948
01:13:14,268 --> 01:13:14,754
Oh no!

949
01:13:14,789 --> 01:13:15,906
We've got to go after her.

950
01:13:16,375 --> 01:13:18,002
Luke, we'll need the dogsled.

951
01:13:18,037 --> 01:13:18,492
I'm on it, babe.

952
01:13:18,527 --> 01:13:19,179
I'll drive.

953
01:13:19,214 --> 01:13:19,875
You're the boss.

954
01:13:19,910 --> 01:13:20,467
Come on, Dad!

955
01:13:20,502 --> 01:13:23,263
No, you get the sled, I'll catch up! I have something to do.

956
01:13:23,855 --> 01:13:25,079
Come on, Gary, I have an idea.

957
01:13:25,114 --> 01:13:26,889
What? Oh. Huh?

958
01:13:31,994 --> 01:13:36,411
Christmas is mine! (slight chuckle) All mine! (chuckles)

959
01:13:41,055 --> 01:13:41,755
What--

960
01:14:02,397 --> 01:14:05,656
They won't fly for you! You don't have the Christmas spirit!

961
01:14:10,852 --> 01:14:11,816
There's no escape!

962
01:14:16,908 --> 01:14:19,773
Nice try old man, but you can't cut me off.

963
01:14:34,479 --> 01:14:38,124
Ñòîé! ... Dad!

964
01:14:39,067 --> 01:14:39,976
You okay?

965
01:14:40,011 --> 01:14:41,168
What the heck was that?

966
01:14:43,547 --> 01:14:46,135
I made a few special modifications to the sleigh.

967
01:14:55,259 --> 01:14:59,401
Ñòîé! ... Ñòîé!

968
01:15:03,822 --> 01:15:04,786
Toys are gone.

969
01:15:04,821 --> 01:15:06,118
What did you expect?

970
01:15:10,269 --> 01:15:13,632
(exhales) Teri lives here? Dad, wasn't this your fishing shack?

971
01:15:17,284 --> 01:15:20,597
NAUGHTY                      NICE

972
01:15:25,448 --> 01:15:27,312
Can somebody say, "Creepy"?

973
01:15:28,612 --> 01:15:29,351
(scoffs) You think?

974
01:15:29,752 --> 01:15:32,410
I am really going to have to call my lawyer.

975
01:15:45,272 --> 01:15:46,395
That's far enough!

976
01:15:46,430 --> 01:15:48,506
Phoebe! What are you doing?

977
01:15:50,565 --> 01:15:51,305
Don't!

978
01:15:51,340 --> 01:15:51,610
Oh, no!

979
01:15:51,645 --> 01:15:52,570
I'll do it, I swear.

980
01:15:52,605 --> 01:15:53,738
What has gotten into you?

981
01:15:54,507 --> 01:16:03,918
Me? What about you? Christmas is the most important job in the world and I am the only one that wants to do it.

982
01:16:03,919 --> 01:16:09,597
You two couldn't wait to call it quits. But somehow that makes me the bad guy.

983
01:16:09,632 --> 01:16:12,072
So you decided to steal Christmas?

984
01:16:12,107 --> 01:16:24,655
I'm not stealing it, I'm saving it. From you two. I deserve this, Mary. After all those years of loyal service, Christmas is mine!

985
01:16:24,690 --> 01:16:28,471
Phoebe, you're one of the best elves I ever had.

986
01:16:28,506 --> 01:16:40,926
Elves? Who wants to be an elf? No one out there even knows who we are. But everyone can name the reindeer! And all they do is pull the sleigh!

987
01:16:42,536 --> 01:16:43,746
(scoffs) Yeah, through the sky!

988
01:16:43,781 --> 01:16:44,738
Not helping.

989
01:16:44,773 --> 01:16:45,775
(whispers) Sorry.

990
01:16:45,810 --> 01:16:52,851
Well, this is one elf no one's going to forget. If I can't run Christmas, no one will.

991
01:16:53,718 --> 01:16:54,384
No, no!

992
01:16:54,552 --> 01:16:55,272
Oh, go ahead!

993
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:55,921
What?

994
01:16:55,956 --> 01:16:56,596
What did you say?

995
01:16:56,631 --> 01:17:01,803
Doesn't matter. You can steal Christmas, you can destroy it, you can even save it.

996
01:17:03,361 --> 01:17:10,903
We all have dreams, Phoebe. But what good is getting everything you always wanted unless you have someone to share it with?

997
01:17:24,504 --> 01:17:27,327
Come on. I know you can do it.

998
01:17:29,666 --> 01:17:30,282
So this is it?

999
01:17:34,883 --> 01:17:41,275
All I have to do is-is hand this over and everything goes back to the way it was?

1000
01:17:43,709 --> 01:17:44,452
Of course.

1001
01:17:44,487 --> 01:17:48,990
Phoebe, it's the right thing to do.

1002
01:18:01,829 --> 01:18:02,852
No!

1003
01:18:02,887 --> 01:18:03,468
No!

1004
01:18:09,027 --> 01:18:09,947
Oh my God.

1005
01:18:09,982 --> 01:18:11,395
What have I done?

1006
01:18:11,430 --> 01:18:14,378
You destroyed Christmas! So what are we going to do now?

1007
01:18:17,938 --> 01:18:20,665
Wait! (pants) (continues)

1008
01:18:20,700 --> 01:18:21,026
Skip?

1009
01:18:25,479 --> 01:18:26,343
The toys!

1010
01:18:26,378 --> 01:18:27,168
It's too late!

1011
01:18:27,203 --> 01:18:29,600
She dropped the whole bag in the ocean.

1012
01:18:29,635 --> 01:18:31,086
Wha-What bag?

1013
01:18:31,121 --> 01:18:33,447
The bag of toys from the sleigh, Skip.

1014
01:18:33,482 --> 01:18:35,320
The peanut butter cookie bag?

1015
01:18:35,355 --> 01:18:36,552
& What?

1016
01:18:36,587 --> 01:18:40,519
The peanut butter cookies. I put a big bag of them in the sleigh. For Teri. Or--

1017
01:18:45,290 --> 01:18:54,556
Or Phoebe. You said they were your favorite. And, you know, since the kids don't usually put out peanut butter cookies... (slight chuckle) Well, I figured it'd be a nice treat.

1018
01:18:56,519 --> 01:19:00,430
You-You did that for me?

1019
01:19:02,557 --> 01:19:06,780
Well, it is Christmas.

1020
01:19:09,291 --> 01:19:12,671
(laughs) Skip! So the elves saved Christmas!

1021
01:19:12,706 --> 01:19:13,713
Looks like it.

1022
01:19:13,748 --> 01:19:18,729
Well, I'd better look at their contract again. It seems I've been a bit hard on the little buggers.

1023
01:19:18,764 --> 01:19:22,294
Oh, wait a second, Mr. C. How are you going to pull this off if you're so far behind?

1024
01:19:22,329 --> 01:19:29,699
There's no way only one Santa can deliver all those presents in time. But two can.

1025
01:19:31,420 --> 01:19:37,122
Two can. Two can! Yeah, yeah! Two can!

1026
01:19:37,644 --> 01:19:39,436
Help me unhitch the reindeer, okay?

1027
01:19:39,471 --> 01:19:40,284
I'm on it!

1028
01:19:42,140 --> 01:19:43,785
Yes. Yes. (laughs)

1029
01:19:45,722 --> 01:19:49,689
Phoebe. We can use a hand.

1030
01:20:01,973 --> 01:20:06,168
Very clever, Mary. I guess I owe you one.

1031
01:20:06,203 --> 01:20:09,935
Oh, come on, Dad. It's two you owe me.

1032
01:20:12,988 --> 01:20:20,109
(chuckles) I have to say this. I'm sorry. You have your own life, I shouldn't have forced you to lead mine.

1033
01:20:20,144 --> 01:20:24,781
Don't worry about it, Dad. It's a mistake we all make sometimes.

1034
01:20:24,816 --> 01:20:33,982
You don't have to follow in my footsteps for me to be proud of you. You're the best Christmas present a father ever could ask for.

1035
01:20:41,224 --> 01:20:41,927
Wow. (slight chuckle) Thanks, Dad.

1036
01:20:44,310 --> 01:20:45,999
Are you guys sure this is going to work?

1037
01:20:46,034 --> 01:20:49,055
It's Christmas. It always does.

1038
01:20:49,090 --> 01:20:50,176
Right.

1039
01:20:50,211 --> 01:20:51,582
Are you ready?

1040
01:20:56,040 --> 01:20:57,471
Whenever you need me, Dad. (slight chuckle)

1041
01:21:00,921 --> 01:21:01,887
On Dasher!

1042
01:21:01,922 --> 01:21:04,734
On Cupid!

1043
01:21:08,935 --> 01:21:12,067
Ho, ho, ho, ho, ho! Merry Christmas!

1044
01:21:12,102 --> 01:21:15,395
Merry Christmas! Bye, Luke!

1045
01:21:23,243 --> 01:21:25,205
Oh, hey. You guys want a lift?

1046
01:21:26,899 --> 01:21:28,795
I think we'll walk.

1047
01:21:28,830 --> 01:21:31,820
(slight chuckle) All right. Merry Christmas.

1048
01:21:40,477 --> 01:21:44,392
Hike, hike! Yeah! Hike! Hike, hike! Come on, hike!

1049
01:21:47,384 --> 01:21:51,910
And you have four new client meetings scheduled for next week, plus the new Webber Group proposal to finish up. Busy, busy.

1050
01:21:51,945 --> 01:21:53,748
Wouldn't have it any other way.

1051
01:21:53,783 --> 01:22:04,867
(slight chuckle)  Good evening, Whitmore-Class, Sandy speaking. Um, I'm afraid she's gone for the weekend, can I have her return? Okay, thank you. (to Mary) Oh, and you have a conference call with Colin Monday morning.

1052
01:22:04,902 --> 01:22:08,779
You know, maybe I'll just swing by their offices.

1053
01:22:08,814 --> 01:22:09,597
In London?

1054
01:22:09,632 --> 01:22:14,864
Sandy, haven't you ever been to London? Nice wide chimneys. (chuckles)

1055
01:22:14,899 --> 01:22:20,237
See you Monday. (exhales) On Dasher!

1056
01:22:20,272 --> 01:22:24,625
Whoops.

1057
01:22:27,525 --> 01:22:28,700
Bye.

1058
01:22:36,772 --> 01:22:37,553
(chuckles) Hey, babe!

1059
01:22:37,588 --> 01:22:38,249
Hi.

1060
01:22:39,915 --> 01:22:42,713
I hope you don't mind, but I invited a few people for dinner.

1061
01:22:42,748 --> 01:22:45,268
At last! I am starving to death.

1062
01:22:45,303 --> 01:22:47,116
Nicholas, it's been fifteen minutes.

1063
01:22:47,151 --> 01:22:48,781
But it's been a hungry fifteen minutes.

1064
01:22:49,444 --> 01:22:52,836
Do you realize that you're more beautiful than you were eight-hundred years ago?

1065
01:22:54,403 --> 01:22:55,596
Oh, Nicky. (chuckles)

1066
01:22:59,414 --> 01:23:00,860
What took you so long?

1067
01:23:00,895 --> 01:23:03,074
(exhales) Traffic was a nightmare.
