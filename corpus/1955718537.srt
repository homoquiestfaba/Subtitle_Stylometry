1
00:00:03,371 --> 00:00:05,362
Replicants

2
00:00:05,860 --> 00:00:13,822
are bioengineered humans,design by Tyrell corporation for use off-world.Their enhanced strength made them ideal slave labor

3
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:22,780
After a serious of violent rebellions,their manufacture became prohibited and Tyrell corp went bankrupt

4
00:00:23,278 --> 00:00:30,425
The collapse of ecosystems in the mid 2020s
led to the rise of industrialist Niander Wallace.

5
00:00:30,426 --> 00:00:34,226
Whose mastery of synthetic
farming averted famine

6
00:00:34,724 --> 00:00:42,188
Wallace acquired the remains of Tyrell corp
and created a new line of replicants who obey.

7
00:00:42,686 --> 00:00:49,653
many older model replicants-NEXUS 8s. with open-ended
lifespans-Survived.They are hunted down and "Retired"

8
00:00:50,151 --> 00:00:53,137
those that hunt
them still go by the name...

9
00:00:53,635 --> 00:01:00,104
Blade Runner

10
00:04:52,608 --> 00:04:54,997
i hope you dont mind
if im taking you in the dirty.

11
00:04:58,480 --> 00:05:02,462
I was carefully not to.

12
00:05:03,855 --> 00:05:05,447
drag me in to the dirt.

13
00:05:07,438 --> 00:05:08,931
i dont want to the dirt...

14
00:05:10,225 --> 00:05:11,419
do you have a warrant
or an announced trespasses

15
00:05:15,301 --> 00:05:16,396
Are you a police?

16
00:05:18,486 --> 00:05:22,865
Are you Sapper Morton, id NK68514?

17
00:05:23,164 --> 00:05:24,358
I'm a farmer.

18
00:05:25,354 --> 00:05:26,349
a farmer.

19
00:05:27,444 --> 00:05:28,837
Why are you following me?

20
00:05:36,402 --> 00:05:37,795
This is the protein state.

21
00:05:38,790 --> 00:05:40,283
Designed by Wallace.

22
00:05:42,473 --> 00:05:43,767
Do I smell it?

23
00:05:44,862 --> 00:05:46,255
I grow up by myself.

24
00:05:47,449 --> 00:05:49,739
Garlic.
- I see.

25
00:05:50,734 --> 00:05:52,227
Just taste it.

26
00:05:53,421 --> 00:05:54,715
No thanks.

27
00:05:56,905 --> 00:06:00,687
The hard work works
better with the empty stomach.

28
00:06:03,773 --> 00:06:05,166
How long have
you been here?

29
00:06:05,564 --> 00:06:07,157
Since 2020.

30
00:06:08,351 --> 00:06:10,640
But you have
done more, is not it?

31
00:06:12,830 --> 00:06:14,124
Your bags.

32
00:06:14,721 --> 00:06:16,612
Settlement Medical Service.

33
00:06:16,911 --> 00:06:18,603
Military equipment.

34
00:06:20,991 --> 00:06:24,077
Where were you?
Callantha?

35
00:06:28,158 --> 00:06:29,551
Certainly brutal.

36
00:06:30,347 --> 00:06:32,039
Why dont you take me in?

37
00:06:33,632 --> 00:06:34,627
And...

38
00:06:35,324 --> 00:06:37,016
take a look inside?

39
00:06:37,414 --> 00:06:38,509
Mr. Morton,

40
00:06:39,902 --> 00:06:41,992
if it is...

41
00:06:46,471 --> 00:06:48,960
it is a better option.

42
00:06:50,552 --> 00:06:52,941
Someone, however,
would come in time.

43
00:06:55,529 --> 00:06:57,420
I got to the point.

44
00:07:01,202 --> 00:07:02,396
Whatever.

45
00:07:05,979 --> 00:07:06,975
Now...

46
00:07:07,771 --> 00:07:09,363
Could you

47
00:07:10,359 --> 00:07:12,847
look up to the left.

48
00:08:09,878 --> 00:08:11,072
Do not rise.

49
00:08:22,618 --> 00:08:26,002
How do you feel
like killing yourself?

50
00:08:29,685 --> 00:08:32,472
I do not delete my own
because we do not escape.

51
00:08:34,860 --> 00:08:36,602
Fault of old models.

52
00:08:36,702 --> 00:08:41,429
And the new designs
clean the shit out.

53
00:08:45,908 --> 00:08:47,899
Because you have
not seen a miracle.

54
00:09:29,503 --> 00:09:31,195
Describe all.

55
00:09:43,138 --> 00:09:44,631
Miss Commissar.

56
00:09:45,229 --> 00:09:47,617
<i>Opening a police message.</i>

57
00:09:51,001 --> 00:09:52,096
<i>You're hurt.</i>

58
00:09:52,395 --> 00:09:53,589
<i>I will not pay it.</i>

59
00:09:54,784 --> 00:09:56,575
To dip it.
<i>- I?</i>

60
00:10:02,945 --> 00:10:07,026
<i>Latest Nexus 8s.
You could tear your head off.</i>

61
00:10:07,723 --> 00:10:08,519
Tried.

62
00:10:08,618 --> 00:10:10,509
<i>It disappeared after Kalanthia.</i>

63
00:10:11,007 --> 00:10:13,495
<i>With a few others
that could be decided.</i>

64
00:10:14,590 --> 00:10:16,481
<i>One Only?</i>
- Just one.

65
00:10:17,377 --> 00:10:18,970
<i>Get in control.</i>

66
00:10:23,349 --> 00:10:24,444
Momentarily, ma'am.

67
00:11:12,617 --> 00:11:14,707
From 30 meters to maximum depth.

68
00:11:30,532 --> 00:11:31,627
<i>What is it?</i>

69
00:11:37,400 --> 00:11:38,594
<i>I'm sending a digging group.</i>

70
00:11:40,187 --> 00:11:41,580
<i>Come before the storm.</i>

71
00:12:59,314 --> 00:13:02,897
<i>Constable KD6-3.7, will be started.</i>

72
00:13:02,996 --> 00:13:04,688
<i>Ready?</i>
- Yes.

73
00:13:06,181 --> 00:13:07,674
<i>A statement for your test bed.</i>

74
00:13:07,873 --> 00:13:10,660
And there was
bloodshed emptiness

75
00:13:12,750 --> 00:13:14,641
Kennosto if there is another commonness

76
00:13:14,741 --> 00:13:17,130

Pain in the fuck, imitation leather.

79
00:13:22,007 --> 00:13:23,301
Too bad in contrast

80
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:26,585
night against the white fountain

81
00:13:28,078 --> 00:13:29,272
<i>Cells.</i>

<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

00:13:44,252 --> 00:13:45,994
<i>Did you know

<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

00:13:47,487 --> 00:13:49,079
<i>Do you want to contact our heart?</i>

94
00:13:49,179 --> 00:13:50,473
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

95
00:13:50,572 --> 00:13:52,264
<i>Do you dream
about the connection?</i>

96
00:13:52,364 --> 00:13:53,060
Together.

97
00:13:53,160 --> 00:13:54,852

<i>Say three times "in one cell".</i>

103
00:14:04,208 --> 00:14:09,383
In one of the cellars, together
with the cell, together with the cell.

104
00:14:12,170 --> 00:14:13,365
<i>Prepare.</i>

105

Thank you.

00:14:22,024 --> 00:14:23,815
<i>Watch out. Watch out.</i>

109
00:14:25,010 --> 00:14:26,801
<i>Watch out. Watch out.</i>

<i>Connecting to the outside
world at anytime from anywhere.</i>

<i>You can leave

114
00:14:57,059 --> 00:14:59,845
What is a Korean tin soldier?

115
00:14:59,945 --> 00:15:03,727
Kyy walks home, right?

116
00:15:03,827 --> 00:15:05,220
Who's waiting for you?

117
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,609
I'll knock you on your ass!

118
00:15:18,060 --> 00:15:19,801
PAIN BIRTH, COFFEE

119
00:15:33,786 --> 00:15:37,269
K, I did not hear you.
You came early.

120
00:15:37,369 --> 00:15:38,961
Will I come again?

121
00:15:39,558 --> 00:15:41,449
Go to laundry.
- Yes ma'am.

122
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:44,933
How did the meeting go?

123
00:15:47,023 --> 00:15:48,417
Usually.

124
00:15:49,312 --> 00:15:50,407
How was your day?

125
00:15:50,507 --> 00:15:51,502
Oh...

126
00:15:52,298 --> 00:15:53,891
I'll go crazy inside.

127
00:15:55,085 --> 00:15:58,370
<i>99.9% sterile water.</i>

128
00:16:01,953 --> 00:16:03,844
There was a damage at work.

129
00:16:04,740 --> 00:16:06,332
The shirt should go to ruin.

130
00:16:07,128 --> 00:16:10,313
Give me, so I'll fix it.

131
00:16:16,982 --> 00:16:18,276
I need a spade.

132
00:16:19,570 --> 00:16:20,764
Do you want to spit first?

133
00:16:20,963 --> 00:16:22,755
Mm-hmm. Pour for me.

134
00:16:24,845 --> 00:16:28,229
I need exercise
with a new recipe.

135
00:16:28,627 --> 00:16:30,219
Do not waste your time.

136
00:16:32,708 --> 00:16:34,698
You should have marinate longer.

137
00:16:35,096 --> 00:16:36,689
Hope it did not come dry.

138
00:16:39,277 --> 00:16:43,656
Did you know that Reprise Records
released this song in 1966?

139
00:16:44,353 --> 00:16:46,144
It became a lynchpin.

140
00:16:51,718 --> 00:16:55,102
Not for long. Final order only.

141
00:16:59,581 --> 00:17:03,463
Now is ready. Hope to taste.

142
00:17:03,562 --> 00:17:05,553
In vain stress.

143
00:17:07,245 --> 00:17:08,539
Still.

144
00:17:11,525 --> 00:17:14,013
Voilà. Bon appétit.

145
00:17:16,999 --> 00:17:18,492
I was sorry, darling.

146
00:17:20,881 --> 00:17:22,473
Muru, look good.

147
00:17:23,070 --> 00:17:24,464
Raise your feet up.

148
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:26,952
Relax.

149
00:17:45,266 --> 00:17:46,858
What day, huh?

150
00:17:48,550 --> 00:17:49,844
What day.

151
00:17:51,138 --> 00:17:52,332
Would you read to me?

152
00:17:54,323 --> 00:17:55,816
Cheer up.

153
00:17:56,314 --> 00:17:57,408
You hate that.

154
00:17:57,508 --> 00:17:58,802
I do not want to.

155
00:18:01,290 --> 00:18:02,285
Let's Dance.

156
00:18:02,385 --> 00:18:04,774
Do you want to
dance or open your gift?

157
00:18:05,072 --> 00:18:06,267
What a gift?

158
00:18:10,547 --> 00:18:11,542
This.

159
00:18:12,040 --> 00:18:13,234
What a glory?

160
00:18:13,732 --> 00:18:15,224
It is said...

161
00:18:16,021 --> 00:18:17,215
that is our wedding day.

162
00:18:17,713 --> 00:18:18,708
Is it?

163
00:18:20,301 --> 00:18:21,694
No but...

164
00:18:22,988 --> 00:18:24,182
is said to be.

165
00:18:25,476 --> 00:18:26,471
Is that okay?

166
00:18:30,453 --> 00:18:31,647
Happy Anniversary.

167
00:18:33,240 --> 00:18:34,633
Radiator.

168
00:18:39,112 --> 00:18:41,600
CONNECT THE RADIATOR

169
00:19:17,431 --> 00:19:18,427
Thank you.

170
00:19:18,725 --> 00:19:22,408
Gold, now you can
go wherever you want.

171
00:19:23,901 --> 00:19:25,394
Where do you want first?

172
00:21:39,263 --> 00:21:41,253
I'm so happy with you.

173
00:21:43,941 --> 00:21:45,235
No need to say that.

174
00:22:06,733 --> 00:22:08,127
VOICE MESSAGE

175
00:22:17,084 --> 00:22:20,070

The box is from the
army to Sapper Morton.

179
00:23:04,362 --> 00:23:08,343
It has been
creatively used as an urge.

180
00:23:09,239 --> 00:23:10,831
Only bones and hair.

181
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:16,305
The samples show that the
woman had been buried for 30 years.

182
00:23:17,301 --> 00:23:21,282
The skeleton has been dismantled, the bones are
cleansed and the entire care is carefully buried.

183
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:22,775
Woman?

184
00:23:24,268 --> 00:23:25,761
The cause of death, Coco?

185
00:23:36,709 --> 00:23:40,193
No fractures, no injuries except...

186
00:23:41,088 --> 00:23:43,179
Innominate.

187
00:23:44,373 --> 00:23:47,160
The baby got stuck in
the narrow breeding channel.

188
00:23:47,259 --> 00:23:48,653
Was she pregnant?

189
00:23:49,051 --> 00:23:50,146
Mm-hmm.

190
00:23:50,444 --> 00:23:51,639
So he was not killed?

191
00:23:51,838 --> 00:23:53,629
She died for her childbirth.

192
00:23:55,918 --> 00:23:56,914
What is that?

193
00:23:58,506 --> 00:23:59,502
Back.

194
00:24:00,795 --> 00:24:01,791
Getting closer.

195
00:24:03,582 --> 00:24:04,578
Yet.

196
00:24:07,862 --> 00:24:08,857
That.

197
00:24:11,246 --> 00:24:12,242
Duh.

198
00:24:12,640 --> 00:24:16,024
Tracks in the
bowel of the bowel.

199
00:24:16,422 --> 00:24:19,507
A thin knife, like a scalpel.

200
00:24:20,801 --> 00:24:22,991
Looks like an emergency section.

201
00:24:23,887 --> 00:24:26,972
The cuts are clean,
not defense damage.

202
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:29,460
He was a doctor.

203
00:24:30,953 --> 00:24:32,944
Maybe saving was a business.

204
00:24:33,043 --> 00:24:34,935
He did not look like a rescue guy.

205
00:24:35,233 --> 00:24:37,423
He saw the trouble
of burying a woman.

206
00:24:37,622 --> 00:24:39,413
Sensitive skirt.

207
00:24:41,902 --> 00:24:42,897
Sorry.

208
00:24:43,693 --> 00:24:45,385
Where is the child?

209
00:24:46,878 --> 00:24:48,172
Did you look at the whole area?

210
00:24:48,272 --> 00:24:51,357
Only land and
worms, no other corpses.

211
00:24:51,457 --> 00:24:52,850
Maybe he was hungry.

212
00:25:41,720 --> 00:25:43,611
Out.

213
00:25:46,099 --> 00:25:47,592
He was a replicant.

214
00:25:50,578 --> 00:25:51,573
Pregnant.

215
00:26:01,228 --> 00:26:06,005
The world is on a wall that
separates half of each other.

216
00:26:07,299 --> 00:26:10,484
Without the wall begins war.

217
00:26:11,380 --> 00:26:12,475
Or slaughter.

218
00:26:16,854 --> 00:26:18,447
So what you saw,

219
00:26:20,835 --> 00:26:22,428
did not happen.

220
00:26:24,418 --> 00:26:25,414
Yes ma'am.

221
00:26:25,911 --> 00:26:28,798
My job is to maintain order.

222
00:26:28,897 --> 00:26:31,386
We maintain order.

223
00:26:33,575 --> 00:26:34,869
Delete this?

224
00:26:36,760 --> 00:26:38,353
Delete all.

225
00:26:38,452 --> 00:26:40,841
Baby?
- I tracked it.

226
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:46,813
Was there anything else?

227
00:26:49,301 --> 00:26:51,789
I have not deleted the birth.

228
00:26:53,282 --> 00:26:54,278
So what?

229
00:26:59,155 --> 00:27:01,245
The born ones have a soul.

230
00:27:02,738 --> 00:27:04,231
Do you refuse?

231
00:27:05,525 --> 00:27:07,217
I did not know I could, ma'am.

232
00:27:08,112 --> 00:27:09,108
There you go.

233
00:27:12,790 --> 00:27:13,786
Hey.

234
00:27:14,383 --> 00:27:16,174
You did it without me.

235
00:27:16,871 --> 00:27:17,866
Without what, ma'am.

236
00:27:18,762 --> 00:27:19,758
The soul.

237
00:28:06,836 --> 00:28:11,414
<i>And the new
designs clean the shit out.</i>

238
00:28:13,902 --> 00:28:15,893
<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

239
00:28:32,813 --> 00:28:38,785
Wallace Headquarters

240
00:28:40,278 --> 00:28:42,269
I'm checking
the old serial number.

241
00:28:47,743 --> 00:28:49,236
DNA verification?

242
00:28:50,629 --> 00:28:51,724
Hair.

243
00:29:09,241 --> 00:29:10,237
Oops.

244
00:29:11,033 --> 00:29:12,128
Old.

245
00:29:13,322 --> 00:29:14,616
Parent older.

246
00:29:16,308 --> 00:29:18,100
It will be difficult.

247
00:29:19,493 --> 00:29:22,579
And so little is left,
what is left is...

248
00:29:23,673 --> 00:29:25,067
clumped.

249
00:29:26,261 --> 00:29:28,550
Customize your mind.

250
00:29:29,546 --> 00:29:31,536
As human as you want.

251
00:29:32,432 --> 00:29:35,518
But since it is a drilling site,

252
00:29:36,015 --> 00:29:39,997
I would not waste your money
on intelligence, affection or charm.

253
00:29:41,091 --> 00:29:43,978
Gun models are a matter of fact.

254
00:29:58,012 --> 00:30:00,400
Will we go on later.

255
00:30:03,685 --> 00:30:06,870
Everyone remembers
where they were at the break.

256
00:30:07,069 --> 00:30:08,612
Just before the time.

257
00:30:09,657 --> 00:30:13,041
I was at home with my parents.
And then ten days of darkness.

258
00:30:13,140 --> 00:30:14,633
The machines went to the place.

259
00:30:14,733 --> 00:30:17,221
When the lights came on,
the memories were empty.

260
00:30:17,321 --> 00:30:20,804
Images, files that bit out.

261
00:30:21,202 --> 00:30:24,089
We did not send bank squares.

262
00:30:24,188 --> 00:30:26,179
It feels so good that there is only paper.

263
00:30:26,278 --> 00:30:29,264
Everything was on
record, just about everything.

264
00:30:31,553 --> 00:30:34,241
Mom still cries after baby pictures.

265
00:30:34,738 --> 00:30:36,231
It's a pity it is.

266
00:30:36,829 --> 00:30:38,222
Lose sweet pictures.

267
00:30:44,293 --> 00:30:46,682
Time from shards, not much.

268
00:30:47,976 --> 00:30:50,166
Last models before the ban.

269
00:30:50,763 --> 00:30:54,147
Tyrell's standard set.

270
00:30:54,645 --> 00:30:55,640
And?

271
00:30:56,436 --> 00:30:59,124
Ordinary.
- Ordinary?

272
00:30:59,721 --> 00:31:01,612
There may be more.

273
00:31:09,972 --> 00:31:12,063
The old serial
number returns home.

274
00:31:14,053 --> 00:31:16,541
30 year old thing managed.

275
00:31:17,537 --> 00:31:18,532
Thank you, Constable.

276
00:31:20,324 --> 00:31:22,016
I'm Mr. Wallace's representative Luv.

277
00:31:24,802 --> 00:31:25,997
She gave me the name.

278
00:31:27,092 --> 00:31:28,485
Really.

279
00:31:29,580 --> 00:31:31,969
I represent Wallace. This way.

280
00:31:38,836 --> 00:31:41,922
The old models spoiled
the company's reputation.

281
00:31:43,614 --> 00:31:47,894
What a gift Mr. Wallace to the world.

282
00:31:51,377 --> 00:31:54,861
He rescued the foreign lands
when he bought Tyrell.

283
00:31:55,159 --> 00:31:56,851
Beware of technology.

284
00:31:58,145 --> 00:31:59,837
And that is not
what we have yet.

285
00:32:10,388 --> 00:32:14,269
You are also a customer.
Are you satisfied?

286
00:32:15,464 --> 00:32:18,748
Very realistic. Thank you.

287
00:32:19,943 --> 00:32:22,232
The trash are preserved here.

288
00:32:22,729 --> 00:32:25,218
For your luck, Mr Wallace
is a computer program.

289
00:32:38,057 --> 00:32:39,650
No one has ever been here.

290
00:32:43,133 --> 00:32:44,129
I apologize.

291
00:32:56,172 --> 00:33:00,053
All our memories of that time
were destroyed in a break.

292
00:33:01,248 --> 00:33:03,039
But there are snippets.

293
00:33:19,761 --> 00:33:22,448
<i>Your son collects butterflies.
He'll show you his collection</i>

294
00:33:22,647 --> 00:33:24,936
<i>as well as the slaughter.
- I took the doctor.</i>

295
00:33:27,424 --> 00:33:29,714
<i>... with your wasp hand.</i>

296
00:33:29,813 --> 00:33:30,908
<i>I would kill him.</i>

297
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:36,880
<i>You can find a nudity picture
of a girl's full page in a magazine.</i>

298
00:33:37,577 --> 00:33:40,463
<i>Is this a replicating or
lesbian test, Mr Deckard?</i>

299
00:33:40,562 --> 00:33:42,354
<i>Please reply only.</i>

300
00:33:46,534 --> 00:33:48,326
He was not sure about him.

301
00:33:48,724 --> 00:33:51,312
Or someone was not there.

302
00:33:52,506 --> 00:33:54,298
It was difficult to identify us then.

303
00:33:56,388 --> 00:33:58,777
Is anything special about her?

304
00:33:59,871 --> 00:34:01,763
You started a formal investigation.

305
00:34:04,748 --> 00:34:07,237
Old serial numbers
are aroused by feelings.

306
00:34:08,431 --> 00:34:11,218
Everyone sleeps better
when they are aware of them.

307
00:34:14,702 --> 00:34:15,697
The woman likes her.

308
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:18,484
Who?

309
00:34:19,180 --> 00:34:21,171
This is Constable Deckard.

310
00:34:22,764 --> 00:34:24,157
He is trying to irritate.

311
00:34:28,138 --> 00:34:31,124
Personal questions stimulate.

312
00:34:31,821 --> 00:34:33,115
Get to know...

313
00:34:34,707 --> 00:34:36,101
do not want to.

314
00:34:37,494 --> 00:34:39,087
Do you keep your job, constable?

315
00:34:44,063 --> 00:34:46,054
I thank Mr Wallace for your time.

316
00:34:58,694 --> 00:35:01,979
You knew Constable Deckard.

317
00:35:03,173 --> 00:35:04,467
What can you tell him about?

318
00:35:05,661 --> 00:35:07,453
Lonely wolf.

319
00:35:08,846 --> 00:35:09,941
Like me.

320
00:35:12,628 --> 00:35:15,415
Together, we were acting alone.

321
00:35:17,008 --> 00:35:18,003
That's it.

322
00:35:19,596 --> 00:35:21,387
Can you tell me anything else?

323
00:35:23,477 --> 00:35:25,866
She was not meant to be here.

324
00:35:28,056 --> 00:35:29,051
Why not?

325
00:35:31,838 --> 00:35:33,829
Something in his eyes.

326
00:35:37,213 --> 00:35:39,303
Could he contact him?

327
00:35:39,999 --> 00:35:40,995
No.

328
00:35:42,886 --> 00:35:44,777
She is <i> retired </i>.

329
00:35:48,161 --> 00:35:49,256
Retired.

330
00:35:51,246 --> 00:35:52,242
What happened?

331
00:35:52,640 --> 00:35:54,730
I guess I want it.

332
00:35:57,318 --> 00:35:58,711
Be alone.

333
00:36:23,992 --> 00:36:25,585
Welcome back, Mr Wallace.

334
00:36:27,277 --> 00:36:30,063
Are you looking for a
new model to be delivered?

335
00:36:31,955 --> 00:36:36,035
An angel should not come
to the Kingdom of Heaven

336
00:36:36,832 --> 00:36:38,026
without a gift.

337
00:36:40,912 --> 00:36:43,998
Can you even say "Child is born"?

338
00:36:55,145 --> 00:36:56,439
New model...

339
00:37:04,402 --> 00:37:06,392
We'll see.

340
00:37:54,963 --> 00:37:58,148
First

341
00:38:00,039 --> 00:38:01,632
feared

342
00:38:03,523 --> 00:38:05,115
from the clay front.

343
00:38:08,101 --> 00:38:09,594
Think.

344
00:38:10,988 --> 00:38:13,576
Before we even
know who we are,

345
00:38:15,865 --> 00:38:17,557
we are afraid to lose it.

346
00:38:19,348 --> 00:38:20,543
Happy Birthday.

347
00:38:30,396 --> 00:38:31,989
Let's see you now.

348
00:39:23,546 --> 00:39:25,238
We make angels

349
00:39:27,029 --> 00:39:29,717
for humanity.

350
00:39:31,309 --> 00:39:36,684
There were bad
angels, but I do good.

351
00:39:36,883 --> 00:39:41,163
And I took us
to nine new worlds.

352
00:39:44,049 --> 00:39:45,144
The nine...

353
00:39:47,134 --> 00:39:50,618
The child can count
nine with their fingers.

354
00:39:50,718 --> 00:39:53,504
The stars should be ours!

355
00:39:53,604 --> 00:39:54,599
Yes, Mr Wallace.

356
00:39:57,983 --> 00:40:02,860
Humanity has come up
with a sacrificial labor force.

357
00:40:02,960 --> 00:40:08,036
There is no return to Orjs,
except for biotechnology.

358
00:40:11,619 --> 00:40:13,510
But production has its limits.

359
00:40:19,482 --> 00:40:21,473
Karu pasture.

360
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:25,952
Empty and dry.

361
00:40:27,843 --> 00:40:28,937
This here.

362
00:40:31,426 --> 00:40:34,412
Emptiness on the road to the stars.

363
00:40:36,601 --> 00:40:39,388
Does this have to
change for heaven's sake?

364
00:40:44,962 --> 00:40:46,853
They do not add,

365
00:40:46,953 --> 00:40:49,341
no matter how I tried.

366
00:40:50,237 --> 00:40:53,223
We need more than we can do.

367
00:40:53,322 --> 00:40:56,806
Millions and millions of millions.

368
00:40:58,797 --> 00:41:01,285
Let's get Green back.

369
00:41:14,124 --> 00:41:16,215
Tyrell's last trick.

370
00:41:17,110 --> 00:41:18,703
Increase.

371
00:41:19,200 --> 00:41:22,186
Lost perfection.

372
00:41:23,679 --> 00:41:25,670
But the child is born.

373
00:41:28,656 --> 00:41:30,149
Bring it to me.

374
00:41:30,846 --> 00:41:32,139
Okay, Mr Wallace.

375
00:41:40,301 --> 00:41:42,093
Best angel.

376
00:41:43,884 --> 00:41:45,078
Are not you, Luv?

377
00:43:03,111 --> 00:43:06,495
The green-eyed
man who killed Sapper.

378
00:43:06,594 --> 00:43:08,187
Find out what he knows.

379
00:43:27,794 --> 00:43:28,790
Hey.

380
00:43:30,183 --> 00:43:32,074
Come on, hi, android boy.

381
00:43:32,671 --> 00:43:34,065
Are you alone?

382
00:43:34,961 --> 00:43:36,553
The guy is Blade Runner.

383
00:43:37,150 --> 00:43:38,544
Let it be.

384
00:43:39,240 --> 00:43:41,032
Let's go, it's fucking dangerous.
- No worries.

385
00:43:41,430 --> 00:43:42,425
No worries.

386
00:43:48,994 --> 00:43:50,487
Do you buy me a cigarette?

387
00:43:57,654 --> 00:43:59,445
You will not even smile.

388
00:44:02,132 --> 00:44:03,426
Did not you listen to your friends?

389
00:44:04,422 --> 00:44:05,915
Do not you know what I am?

390
00:44:06,412 --> 00:44:07,408
I know.

391
00:44:08,303 --> 00:44:09,896
Rice eating rape.

392
00:44:11,488 --> 00:44:12,484
What is that?

393
00:44:14,076 --> 00:44:15,071
Wood.

394
00:44:15,967 --> 00:44:16,863
Oh.

395
00:44:16,963 --> 00:44:18,356
I have not seen the wood.

396
00:44:20,546 --> 00:44:21,541
It's pretty.

397
00:44:24,129 --> 00:44:25,323
It's dead.

398
00:44:27,214 --> 00:44:31,295
Who holds dead wood?

399
00:44:38,859 --> 00:44:40,651
You do not mind me?

400
00:44:40,750 --> 00:44:43,736
I can kill. What model do you have?

401
00:44:44,234 --> 00:44:46,225
Take your eye.

402
00:44:51,500 --> 00:44:53,192
The right girls
are not interested.

403
00:44:56,675 --> 00:44:59,164
Well, you can find me here.

404
00:48:37,335 --> 00:48:38,330
Hey.

405
00:48:40,421 --> 00:48:41,615
You can not take them.

406
00:48:42,411 --> 00:48:45,497
I understand. I have papers.

407
00:48:45,596 --> 00:48:46,592
Keep this.

408
00:48:48,980 --> 00:48:50,573
Yes, here.

409
00:49:08,090 --> 00:49:09,484
Coco is dead.

410
00:49:11,972 --> 00:49:13,465
Bones are gone.

411
00:49:14,361 --> 00:49:17,944
The information has already
leaked out. How long did it go?

412
00:49:18,939 --> 00:49:21,427
What you have?
And do not say "nothing".

413
00:49:22,821 --> 00:49:23,916
I found that.

414
00:49:25,209 --> 00:49:26,205
Sock?

415
00:49:28,693 --> 00:49:30,385
Where was it found?
- From Sapper's farm.

416
00:49:30,883 --> 00:49:31,878
Anything else?

417
00:49:32,475 --> 00:49:33,869
I burned everything else.

418
00:49:33,968 --> 00:49:37,352
What is this date?
Birth or Death Day?

419
00:49:37,750 --> 00:49:38,845
I do not know yet.

420
00:49:43,225 --> 00:49:45,713
Does not anyone else
see where this leads to?

421
00:49:45,812 --> 00:49:48,301
This is breaking the world, K.

422
00:50:01,140 --> 00:50:03,230
I have known many like you.

423
00:50:05,818 --> 00:50:07,211
Useful but...

424
00:50:08,008 --> 00:50:10,197
for you I forget sometimes.

425
00:50:11,193 --> 00:50:13,183
You were not
there when I was a kid.

426
00:50:19,553 --> 00:50:21,643
Do you remember anything?

427
00:50:22,738 --> 00:50:25,625
Before you came to the house.

428
00:50:26,222 --> 00:50:28,113
I have memories, but...

429
00:50:30,104 --> 00:50:32,094
They are not real, but transitions.

430
00:50:33,886 --> 00:50:37,071
Tell one of your childhood.

431
00:50:42,147 --> 00:50:46,526
It feels a little strange to tell
about the childhood I did not live.

432
00:50:48,815 --> 00:50:52,000
Will I help if I tell you?

433
00:50:54,986 --> 00:50:58,967
I remember a toy, a puppy.

434
00:51:00,859 --> 00:51:02,451
Engraving.

435
00:51:05,935 --> 00:51:09,418
I just remember that the boy
was trying to take it away from me.

436
00:51:10,314 --> 00:51:11,409
I ran away.

437
00:51:36,889 --> 00:51:40,770
I'm looking for a hideout,
and it's just a dark oven.

438
00:51:42,662 --> 00:51:45,747
It's really dark and scary, but...

439
00:51:46,245 --> 00:51:49,231
the horse is all out, so I go in.

440
00:52:02,170 --> 00:52:07,146
They will find and try to hack
me to tell, but I will not tell you.

441
00:52:13,715 --> 00:52:14,710
That's it.

442
00:52:17,796 --> 00:52:20,085
Little K defends his own.

443
00:52:22,076 --> 00:52:23,071
Good memory.

444
00:52:30,138 --> 00:52:31,133
Look here.

445
00:52:34,019 --> 00:52:36,508
We are all looking
for something right.

446
00:52:41,882 --> 00:52:43,475
What happens if I
run the whole bottle?

447
00:52:47,854 --> 00:52:49,447
Should I go back to work, ma'am?

448
00:52:59,599 --> 00:53:01,390
Report DNA Search Results.

449
00:53:15,126 --> 00:53:17,813
Constable KD6-3.7.

450
00:53:20,600 --> 00:53:21,595
Search.

451
00:53:22,093 --> 00:53:25,775
6.10.21 generated DNA.

452
00:53:26,174 --> 00:53:27,766
Discrepancies.

453
00:53:28,463 --> 00:53:32,245
<i>No data before pausing.</i>

454
00:53:35,729 --> 00:53:37,221
Satellite Crystal Copy?

455
00:53:37,421 --> 00:53:39,710
<i>Data can not be read.</i>

456
00:53:43,392 --> 00:53:45,682
Clear. Drive raw.

457
00:54:22,807 --> 00:54:24,499
Man is just data.

458
00:54:26,788 --> 00:54:28,978
A, C, T, and G.

459
00:54:29,674 --> 00:54:33,456
Your alphabet has four characters.

460
00:54:35,049 --> 00:54:36,442
I only have two.

461
00:54:40,224 --> 00:54:41,419
One and zero.

462
00:54:42,016 --> 00:54:45,400
Half less, but twice as
sleeker, sweetheart.

463
00:54:46,694 --> 00:54:48,386
You did not want to fuck?

464
00:54:51,173 --> 00:54:52,367
You listened.

465
00:54:53,761 --> 00:54:54,856
Perhaps.

466
00:54:57,045 --> 00:54:59,334
You're not enough
to tell the truth.

467
00:55:00,529 --> 00:55:02,320
6, 10 and 21.

468
00:55:06,700 --> 00:55:08,292
There is nothing to tell.

469
00:55:09,088 --> 00:55:11,776
How many times
have you told me?

470
00:55:14,264 --> 00:55:15,757
Your memories.

471
00:55:17,150 --> 00:55:19,241
Engraved date.

472
00:55:19,738 --> 00:55:21,729
6, 10 and 21.

473
00:55:23,919 --> 00:55:25,212
Coincidence?

474
00:55:29,691 --> 00:55:31,682
A dangerous coincidence.

475
00:55:35,464 --> 00:55:37,654
I always knew you were special.

476
00:55:39,445 --> 00:55:41,137
Maybe this is the specialty.

477
00:55:46,412 --> 00:55:47,607
Child.

478
00:55:48,602 --> 00:55:50,593
Born of a woman.

479
00:55:52,086 --> 00:55:54,076
Entered into the world.

480
00:55:55,569 --> 00:55:57,062
Desired.

481
00:55:58,356 --> 00:55:59,551
Much loved.

482
00:56:02,736 --> 00:56:04,527
Even if it is true,

483
00:56:06,020 --> 00:56:09,504
someone I would
always hunt for me.

484
00:56:11,594 --> 00:56:13,485
Dreams do not hurt.

485
00:56:14,580 --> 00:56:15,575
Is it?

486
00:56:16,769 --> 00:56:17,964
It hurts us.

487
00:56:23,637 --> 00:56:24,632
Stop.

488
00:56:25,827 --> 00:56:29,410
4847 and 2181 side by side.

489
00:56:35,083 --> 00:56:36,377
Identical.

490
00:56:37,173 --> 00:56:38,169
Turn.

491
00:56:41,353 --> 00:56:42,846
Boy and girl.

492
00:56:44,738 --> 00:56:45,832
Out.

493
00:56:47,126 --> 00:56:48,122
Why?

494
00:56:49,216 --> 00:56:51,804
They can not have identical DNA.

495
00:56:53,397 --> 00:56:56,781
The second is a copy.

496
00:57:02,056 --> 00:57:05,241
Both were in the Morrill Cole corpus.

497
00:57:07,431 --> 00:57:09,222
The girl died there.

498
00:57:09,720 --> 00:57:11,213
Genetic Error.

499
00:57:12,706 --> 00:57:14,199
Galatalaissyndrooma.

500
00:57:15,194 --> 00:57:16,189
Son...

501
00:57:18,976 --> 00:57:20,171
disappeared.

502
00:57:22,659 --> 00:57:24,152
Where is the orphanage?

503
00:57:26,939 --> 00:57:28,133
Want to ride?

504
00:58:11,927 --> 00:58:14,912
THE METROPOLIAL ARE ENDED

505
00:58:18,894 --> 00:58:22,875
Waste management in Los
Angeles County of San Diego

506
00:58:44,374 --> 00:58:46,762
Well, we are here.

507
00:58:59,602 --> 00:59:00,697
Belt closed.

508
01:00:00,117 --> 01:00:01,112
K?

509
01:00:52,768 --> 01:00:53,764
K?

510
01:01:51,093 --> 01:01:52,387
Stay away.

511
01:02:07,914 --> 01:02:10,800
Fire. Fire.

512
01:02:12,891 --> 01:02:13,886
Fire.

513
01:02:25,332 --> 01:02:27,223
60 meters to the east.

514
01:02:29,512 --> 01:02:30,508
Fire.

515
01:02:32,797 --> 01:02:33,792
North.

516
01:02:36,380 --> 01:02:37,375
Fire.

517
01:02:38,570 --> 01:02:41,157
Stop. 20 degrees east.

518
01:02:43,347 --> 01:02:44,342
Stop.

519
01:02:45,039 --> 01:02:46,034
Getting closer.

520
01:02:47,925 --> 01:02:48,921
Yet.

521
01:02:52,703 --> 01:02:54,594
Oh you.

522
01:02:55,689 --> 01:02:56,684
Get up.

523
01:02:57,680 --> 01:02:59,073
Do your job.

524
01:03:00,665 --> 01:03:02,059
Find a child.

525
01:03:38,189 --> 01:03:39,383
Watch the car.

526
01:05:18,018 --> 01:05:22,198
Every part, or out of the rain!

527
01:05:22,298 --> 01:05:23,890
Came into the beam!

528
01:05:24,487 --> 01:05:25,881
You work.

529
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:29,364
If you do not, I do not need you.

530
01:05:29,763 --> 01:05:31,355
I do not need any...

531
01:05:34,241 --> 01:05:35,237
Hey.

532
01:05:42,303 --> 01:05:44,792
Nickel is for colonies.

533
01:05:45,190 --> 01:05:50,764
Closer from here can
not get a great outdoors.

534
01:05:51,958 --> 01:05:55,242
The game keeps them active...

535
01:05:55,740 --> 01:05:57,731
and makes them handy.

536
01:05:58,826 --> 01:06:00,219
But work it is.

537
01:06:01,115 --> 01:06:04,200
The job makes it unnecessary.

538
01:06:13,059 --> 01:06:14,153
Well.

539
01:06:16,044 --> 01:06:17,637
What are you looking for?

540
01:06:21,618 --> 01:06:24,604
Because I have all kinds.

541
01:06:27,192 --> 01:06:29,083
No no no...
- I do not buy.

542
01:06:29,680 --> 01:06:32,069
I am an honest player.

543
01:06:32,168 --> 01:06:33,562
Listen...

544
01:06:34,159 --> 01:06:35,552
You even bigger...

545
01:06:38,339 --> 01:06:41,027
Even bigger players
tried to stop me...

546
01:06:41,126 --> 01:06:42,122
and they were...

547
01:06:42,619 --> 01:06:44,510
hard players.

548
01:06:46,700 --> 01:06:49,487
I'm looking for a boy for 30 years.

549
01:06:50,283 --> 01:06:51,975
I need your accounting.

550
01:06:53,468 --> 01:06:55,956
Investments, sales, all.

551
01:06:56,454 --> 01:06:57,947
So the old ones
are not in the books.

552
01:06:58,445 --> 01:06:59,938
Is not it?
- No, no.

553
01:07:02,426 --> 01:07:05,412
Sorry. I can not help.

554
01:07:08,895 --> 01:07:10,388
Are not you?
- No.

555
01:07:15,365 --> 01:07:16,360
Yes you can.

556
01:07:19,147 --> 01:07:21,337
You have a good memory.

557
01:07:22,431 --> 01:07:25,816
Tell me what to remember,
or shoot the hole and look at myself.

558
01:07:40,646 --> 01:07:42,736
They laughed at you...

559
01:08:02,343 --> 01:08:03,637
Are you coming?

560
01:08:14,685 --> 01:08:15,680
Where is it?

561
01:08:19,264 --> 01:08:20,259
Oh God.

562
01:08:25,733 --> 01:08:27,027
Where, where, where?

563
01:08:30,212 --> 01:08:32,004
I can not find it.

564
01:08:40,961 --> 01:08:41,957
It's gone.

565
01:08:44,743 --> 01:08:46,933
The whole year is torn.

566
01:08:49,123 --> 01:08:50,417
I did not do it.

567
01:08:51,313 --> 01:08:52,407
It was not me.

568
01:08:56,190 --> 01:08:57,185
I do not...

569
01:08:58,479 --> 01:08:59,474
I did not.

570
01:13:31,890 --> 01:13:35,573
I always said
that you are special.

571
01:13:40,051 --> 01:13:43,037
Born, not made.

572
01:13:47,118 --> 01:13:48,512
Hidden with care.

573
01:13:52,294 --> 01:13:53,986
Right boy.

574
01:13:56,972 --> 01:13:58,962
The real boy needs the right name.

575
01:14:00,754 --> 01:14:01,749
Joe.

576
01:14:03,939 --> 01:14:04,934
"Joe"?

577
01:14:05,432 --> 01:14:07,422
You are too important for K.

578
01:14:08,617 --> 01:14:10,408
Your mother would have named you.

579
01:14:13,792 --> 01:14:14,788
Joe.

580
01:14:17,375 --> 01:14:18,072
Joe.

581
01:14:18,172 --> 01:14:19,167
Do not.

582
01:14:26,035 --> 01:14:28,324
How do I know if
memory is a move or not?

583
01:14:32,803 --> 01:14:34,296
Who does the memories do?

584
01:15:06,146 --> 01:15:07,639
Dr. Ana Stelline?

585
01:15:11,819 --> 01:15:12,814
Guest.

586
01:15:15,701 --> 01:15:16,696
Is that okay?

587
01:15:17,890 --> 01:15:18,886
Suitable for.

588
01:15:21,075 --> 01:15:22,568
Unusual only.

589
01:15:24,459 --> 01:15:28,540
Fun to meet, Constable KD6-3.7.

590
01:15:33,118 --> 01:15:34,114
Sorry.

591
01:15:34,611 --> 01:15:36,502
Immune Deficiency.

592
01:15:37,398 --> 01:15:40,981
Freedom behind the glass.

593
01:15:41,877 --> 01:15:43,470
Why did not you stay here?

594
01:15:43,669 --> 01:15:44,664
So.

595
01:15:45,261 --> 01:15:48,446
I would have gone with
my parents, but I got sick.

596
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:50,536
So...

597
01:15:51,532 --> 01:15:53,920
my life changed.

598
01:15:54,617 --> 01:15:57,902
They put me in my cup

599
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,888
filling it with what they
can to keep me happy

600
01:16:01,385 --> 01:16:03,376
except with the club of course.

601
01:16:03,973 --> 01:16:05,366
I was used to people.

602
01:16:09,248 --> 01:16:10,841
How can I help?

603
01:16:12,035 --> 01:16:14,324
I thought you
could help the story.

604
01:16:15,917 --> 01:16:21,291
The most interesting offer at a time.

605
01:16:22,784 --> 01:16:25,770
Do you think I'm
working at the same time?

606
01:16:26,766 --> 01:16:27,761
Of course.

607
01:16:35,126 --> 01:16:37,216
I promise to hear every word.

608
01:16:44,482 --> 01:16:47,169
You are considered to be the
best memory in the country.

609
01:16:47,468 --> 01:16:49,160
Kindness.

610
01:16:50,752 --> 01:16:52,644
I love birthday parties.

611
01:16:56,724 --> 01:16:58,118
Do you work for Wallace?

612
01:16:58,914 --> 01:17:02,099
I am one of his subcontractors.

613
01:17:02,696 --> 01:17:06,080
He made a bid, but I
stay an entrepreneur.

614
01:17:08,270 --> 01:17:09,564
What Makes You So Good?

615
01:17:10,559 --> 01:17:13,047
What makes your
memories so authentic?

616
01:17:13,445 --> 01:17:17,029
Well, there is always
something in your work.

617
01:17:18,024 --> 01:17:21,507
But I've been here
eight years old.

618
01:17:22,801 --> 01:17:25,489
To see the world it
was supposed to imagine.

619
01:17:27,778 --> 01:17:30,465
I came to see
you as an imaginator.

620
01:17:32,257 --> 01:17:35,442
Wallace needs me to
be a functional product.

621
01:17:37,134 --> 01:17:38,925
I'm doing it for kindness.

622
01:17:40,816 --> 01:17:42,907
Replicants are hard.

623
01:17:43,106 --> 01:17:45,893
For jobs that people would not do.

624
01:17:46,689 --> 01:17:51,864
I can not change your destiny,
but my memory brings a smile.

625
01:17:53,357 --> 01:17:54,353
Strongly done.

626
01:17:54,452 --> 01:17:57,339
Kivemmin. They seem authentic.

627
01:17:57,438 --> 01:18:00,324
And the real memories are...

628
01:18:00,822 --> 01:18:02,813
genuine feelings.

629
01:18:04,107 --> 01:18:05,301
Is not that right?

630
01:18:13,960 --> 01:18:18,240
Are all made, or is it true?

631
01:18:22,420 --> 01:18:25,207
Using the right memories
is illegal, constable.

632
01:18:27,397 --> 01:18:29,188
How do they
differentiate between them?

633
01:18:29,587 --> 01:18:31,179
Can you identify...

634
01:18:33,170 --> 01:18:34,165
realistic?

635
01:18:36,753 --> 01:18:38,644
It is believed that it is in detail.

636
01:18:39,639 --> 01:18:41,630
But memory does
not work that way.

637
01:18:42,924 --> 01:18:44,616
We remember our feelings.

638
01:18:45,312 --> 01:18:48,099
It's a mess.

639
01:18:50,189 --> 01:18:51,583
I can show you.

640
01:18:53,474 --> 01:18:54,569
Sit down.

641
01:19:13,082 --> 01:19:17,461
Think of the memory
you want to look like.

642
01:19:18,357 --> 01:19:20,447
Just imagine.

643
01:19:21,940 --> 01:19:22,935
Freely.

644
01:20:13,298 --> 01:20:15,189
Someone says this.

645
01:20:17,179 --> 01:20:18,175
This happened.

646
01:20:35,294 --> 01:20:36,588
It is true.

647
01:20:48,532 --> 01:20:49,527
It is true.

648
01:20:53,259 --> 01:20:56,494
Goddamn it!

649
01:21:40,487 --> 01:21:45,065
<i>Constable KD6-3.7, Mrs. calls.</i>

650
01:21:45,165 --> 01:21:48,748
<i>Drop your gun and
keep your hands visible.</i>

651
01:21:49,942 --> 01:21:50,937
<i>- Cells.</i>
- Cells.

652
01:21:51,037 --> 01:21:52,729
<i>Have you ever
been in the facility?</i>

653
01:21:52,828 --> 01:21:53,923
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

654
01:21:54,023 --> 01:21:56,909
<i>Are you locked in free?</i>

655
01:21:57,009 --> 01:21:58,004
<i>Cells.</i>
- Cells.

656
01:21:58,104 --> 01:21:59,398
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

657
01:21:59,497 --> 01:22:02,383
<i>How do you feel like
holding your beloved hand?</i>

658
01:22:02,483 --> 01:22:05,270
<i>Together.</i>
- Together.

659
01:22:05,369 --> 01:22:07,360
<i>Together with the cell.</i>
- In one of the cellars.

660
01:22:07,460 --> 01:22:08,554
<i>Too bad.</i>
- Too bad.

661
01:22:08,654 --> 01:22:10,545
<i>How does it feel
to be full of fear?</i>

662
01:22:10,644 --> 01:22:11,640
<i>Evil.</i>
- Too bad.

663
01:22:11,739 --> 01:22:13,730
<i>Do you like your life apart?</i>

664
01:22:13,829 --> 01:22:14,825
<i>Contrast.</i>
- Contrast.

665
01:22:14,924 --> 01:22:16,915
<i>With a bad contrast.</i>
- It's a bad contrast.

666
01:22:17,014 --> 01:22:18,010
<i>Night.</i>
- Night.

667
01:22:18,109 --> 01:22:20,498
<i>Together with the cell.</i>
- In one of the cellars.

668
01:22:20,598 --> 01:22:23,285
<i>For the same.</i>
- For the same.

669
01:22:23,384 --> 01:22:25,574
<i>And for the bad contrast.</i>
- And the bad contrast.

670
01:22:25,674 --> 01:22:27,167
<i>Against the night.</i>
- Against the night.

671
01:22:27,266 --> 01:22:29,058
<i>The fountain of the valley.</i>

672
01:22:30,252 --> 01:22:32,044
The fountain of the valley.

673
01:22:34,830 --> 01:22:36,522
<i>You are not near a parable.</i>

674
01:22:42,992 --> 01:22:44,485
Out! Door shut.

675
01:22:45,779 --> 01:22:47,471
What the fuck did you get?

676
01:22:48,068 --> 01:22:49,959
I gave you the job.

677
01:22:50,258 --> 01:22:52,447
I emphasized the importance,

678
01:22:52,547 --> 01:22:55,931
and you reel at
the refreshment center.

679
01:22:57,922 --> 01:23:00,111
According to the control,
you have something else.

680
01:23:00,211 --> 01:23:02,301
Far from the benchmark.

681
01:23:02,401 --> 01:23:03,893
Do you know what it means?

682
01:23:03,993 --> 01:23:04,988
I found the child.

683
01:23:10,064 --> 01:23:13,349
He had been made a
standard mate of basic service.

684
01:23:16,235 --> 01:23:17,828
She did not know who she was.

685
01:23:20,416 --> 01:23:22,008
Yeah?
- It's done.

686
01:23:22,108 --> 01:23:24,795
Meaning?
- What did you ask.

687
01:23:26,686 --> 01:23:27,781
It's done.

688
01:23:35,942 --> 01:23:37,734
You just got a bomb.

689
01:23:39,824 --> 01:23:40,819
Good job.

690
01:23:43,805 --> 01:23:45,696
I'm gonna drive you
from the station alive.

691
01:23:45,796 --> 01:23:48,185
But you have 48 hours to find out.

692
01:23:48,881 --> 01:23:50,772
Release your gun and your badge.

693
01:23:50,872 --> 01:23:53,659
In the next control I can not help.

694
01:23:55,948 --> 01:23:56,943
Thank you, ma'am.

695
01:24:29,390 --> 01:24:30,485
You were right.

696
01:24:37,751 --> 01:24:39,443
You were right in everything.

697
01:25:08,307 --> 01:25:11,293
I thought I did not
care about the artist.

698
01:25:14,577 --> 01:25:16,269
I noticed you liked him.

699
01:25:19,554 --> 01:25:20,748
I want this.

700
01:25:21,843 --> 01:25:22,838
She is true.

701
01:25:25,526 --> 01:25:27,218
I want to be right for you.

702
01:25:28,910 --> 01:25:30,701
You're right for me.

703
01:25:31,995 --> 01:25:33,687
You have a good woman.

704
01:25:52,200 --> 01:25:54,589
Well, do it.

705
01:26:17,083 --> 01:26:18,476
Look at the girl.

706
01:26:18,874 --> 01:26:20,467
Hush now. He
needs to be synchronized.

707
01:29:16,238 --> 01:29:19,125
<i>Oh, whatever you want.</i>

708
01:29:21,414 --> 01:29:24,101
<i>Oh, wherever you want.</i>

709
01:29:54,359 --> 01:29:57,444
<i>99.9% sterile water.</i>

710
01:30:27,602 --> 01:30:28,995
It's from wood.

711
01:30:29,095 --> 01:30:30,289
That was it.

712
01:30:31,683 --> 01:30:32,777
You can leave.

713
01:30:44,821 --> 01:30:45,816
Hush now.

714
01:30:46,911 --> 01:30:48,205
I have been inside of you.

715
01:30:49,200 --> 01:30:51,191
There's not much left there.

716
01:31:10,599 --> 01:31:11,594
Coffee?

717
01:31:17,865 --> 01:31:19,557
They'll come soon.

718
01:31:28,813 --> 01:31:30,008
I'll come with you.

719
01:31:31,302 --> 01:31:32,496
But I did not.

720
01:31:33,690 --> 01:31:37,472
They can come from
here for all my memories.

721
01:31:38,766 --> 01:31:40,956
You have to remove
me from the terminal.

722
01:31:42,349 --> 01:31:43,444
My gift.

723
01:31:45,933 --> 01:31:46,928
Put me there.

724
01:31:49,615 --> 01:31:50,909
I can not do it.

725
01:31:52,800 --> 01:31:53,895
Consider.

726
01:31:55,189 --> 01:31:57,379
If something happens
to that, that's it.

727
01:31:58,872 --> 01:31:59,867
You are gone.

728
01:32:00,564 --> 01:32:01,559
So.

729
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:04,346
Like a real girl.

730
01:32:10,815 --> 01:32:11,811
Please.

731
01:32:15,394 --> 01:32:16,787
Joe, please.

732
01:32:18,280 --> 01:32:19,773
I want it.

733
01:32:23,854 --> 01:32:25,247
I can not do it myself.

734
01:32:43,561 --> 01:32:44,656
Replace the antenna.

735
01:33:16,804 --> 01:33:18,994
The right tree.
You're rich, buddy.

736
01:33:19,989 --> 01:33:22,378
I can get you the right horse.

737
01:33:22,477 --> 01:33:25,065
Do you want the right horse?

738
01:33:25,165 --> 01:33:26,459
I do not need.

739
01:33:27,056 --> 01:33:29,743
Really. Like Wallace.

740
01:33:29,843 --> 01:33:31,435
I do not need
the right horse, just...

741
01:33:32,630 --> 01:33:33,924
Just what it is.

742
01:33:37,805 --> 01:33:39,398
Smells from the old land.

743
01:33:40,791 --> 01:33:42,881
But it's newer.

744
01:33:44,673 --> 01:33:46,365
The reactor radiation?

745
01:33:46,464 --> 01:33:48,853
No, more unstable.

746
01:33:51,242 --> 01:33:52,834

Only one place has had
so high radioactivity.

749
01:34:04,181 --> 01:34:05,773
Only one place is so dirty.

750
01:34:08,262 --> 01:34:09,257
No one is living there.

751

where the puppet was.

I told you what,
what do you want now?

753
01:34:20,006 --> 01:34:23,689
Horses, goats, papers
to the outside world?

754

What is it?

775
01:36:20,040 --> 01:36:21,633
Obviously.

776
01:36:32,283 --> 01:36:33,577
Too dark.

777
01:36:36,961 --> 01:36:38,056
I like him.

778
01:36:39,449 --> 01:36:40,544
Good boy.

779
01:36:42,236 --> 01:36:43,231
Where is he?

780
01:36:49,999 --> 01:36:50,995
I have no idea.

01:36:54,379 --> 01:36:55,473

Where would a good boy go?

785
01:37:01,246 --> 01:37:02,441
You are late.

786
01:37:05,825 --> 01:37:06,919
It is not.

787
01:37:10,503 --> 01:37:11,896
He destroyed it.

788
01:37:14,484 --> 01:37:16,375
Everything about him.

789
01:37:17,072 --> 01:37:19,858
Except the box you already made.

790
01:37:24,536 --> 01:37:27,821
But that was not
enough when you came.

791
01:37:35,783 --> 01:37:37,276
Little creature.

792
01:37:39,367 --> 01:37:42,751

mighty one you can not kill.

01:37:44,244 --> 01:37:46,732

Where is he?!

797
01:37:59,770 --> 01:38:01,164
You are so sure.

798
01:38:02,856 --> 01:38:04,647
Because she told me.

799
01:38:05,245 --> 01:38:07,136
Because we're not lying.

800
01:38:09,027 --> 01:38:11,615
I tell Mr Wallace that
you were trying to shoot.

801

01:44:21,471 --> 01:44:22,466
I also read.

816
01:44:49,439 --> 01:44:50,733
I heard the piano.

01:44:55,710 --> 01:44:56,705

820
01:45:02,080 --> 01:45:03,573
I did not come
to take you away.

821
01:45:03,672 --> 01:45:04,667

822
01:45:07,753 --> 01:45:08,748
So what?

823
01:45:11,336 --> 01:45:13,128
I just have questions.

824
01:45:14,123 --> 01:45:15,367
What are the questions?

01:45:33,432 --> 01:45:34,427

01:49:29,419 --> 01:49:30,415
Take the swords.

863
01:52:05,782 --> 01:52:06,977
Why not answer the question?

864
01:52:07,076 --> 01:52:08,071
Which question?

865
01:52:08,171 --> 01:52:10,659
I did not believe
you would grind shit.

866
01:52:11,754 --> 01:52:13,148
What was his name?

867
01:52:26,684 --> 01:52:27,679
Rachael.

868
01:52:32,954 --> 01:52:34,547
His name was Rachael.

869
01:52:38,926 --> 01:52:40,021
What happened to the baby?

870
01:52:43,803 --> 01:52:45,993
Did you send him orphanage?

871
01:52:49,178 --> 01:52:50,969
I had left the times then.

872
01:52:54,851 --> 01:52:56,443
You did not even meet your child?

873
01:52:59,628 --> 01:53:00,624
Why do not you?

874
01:53:02,017 --> 01:53:03,908
I remain in the plan.

875
01:53:06,496 --> 01:53:10,378
I showed you how to mess
up information, covering traces.

876
01:53:11,572 --> 01:53:13,861
My role was to leave.

877
01:53:15,852 --> 01:53:18,340

the trails forever.

878
01:53:18,440 --> 01:53:20,331
I would not have found her.

879
01:53:20,928 --> 01:53:21,923
Did you want to?

880
01:53:22,720 --> 01:53:23,814
Not really.

881
01:53:24,412 --> 01:53:25,208
Why do not you?

882
01:53:25,307 --> 01:53:27,796
We were hunted.

883
01:53:28,393 --> 01:53:30,782
I did not want our
children to be found.

884
01:53:31,180 --> 01:53:34,265
Cut to pieces.

885
01:53:38,147 --> 01:53:40,735

886
01:53:43,123 --> 01:53:44,716

887
01:54:06,115 --> 01:54:07,110
The stranger.

888
01:56:18,790 --> 01:56:19,785

889
01:56:20,581 --> 01:56:21,975
Who did you bring?

890
01:56:23,965 --> 01:56:24,961
No one.

891
01:56:25,458 --> 01:56:26,453
Really?

01:56:38,994 --> 01:56:40,388
I came alone.

Someone wants to meet you.

You can count on us.

902
02:02:56,117 --> 02:02:58,605
You want me to look up to the left.

903
02:03:04,776 --> 02:03:06,070
This is Frey.

904
02:03:06,965 --> 02:03:09,056
He was with Kalashniki in Saphir.

905
02:03:09,354 --> 02:03:10,549
I recognize you.

906
02:03:13,136 --> 02:03:15,027
Did you help hide the child?

907
02:03:17,317 --> 02:03:18,511
I was there.

908
02:03:22,691 --> 02:03:24,483
I saw a miracle birth.

909
02:03:26,075 --> 02:03:28,962
The full faces weeped me.

910
02:03:29,957 --> 02:03:31,450
Smell like a thunder.

911
02:03:45,185 --> 02:03:46,380
Were you with her?

912
02:03:48,669 --> 02:03:49,863
Rachael.

913
02:03:50,261 --> 02:03:51,854
He died in my arms.

914
02:03:53,845 --> 02:03:55,337
We hid the baby

915
02:03:55,437 --> 02:03:57,826
and we vowed
to keep our secrets.

916
02:03:58,722 --> 02:04:00,812
That's why Sapper killed himself.

917
02:04:02,404 --> 02:04:08,276
The child made us
more than slaves.

918
02:04:09,570 --> 02:04:11,760
If a child can become of us,

919
02:04:12,357 --> 02:04:15,244
we are our own cronies.

920
02:04:15,741 --> 02:04:17,732
"More humane than humans".

921
02:04:20,220 --> 02:04:21,713
It is the time of the revolution.

922
02:04:22,410 --> 02:04:24,201
We build an army.

923
02:04:25,893 --> 02:04:27,685
I want to release us.

924
02:04:36,444 --> 02:04:39,629
If you want to be free, join us.

Deckard, Sapper, you, me.

926
02:04:48,338 --> 02:04:51,572
Our lives do not mean anything
near the approaching storm.

927
02:04:52,966 --> 02:04:57,047
Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.

928
02:05:00,232 --> 02:05:02,023
You led to Wallace Deckard.

929
02:05:03,118 --> 02:05:07,000
You can not let Deckard
guide Wallace to me.

930
02:05:07,597 --> 02:05:09,488
You have to kill Deckard.

931
02:05:18,943 --> 02:05:21,432
Deckard just wanted
his baby to be safe.

932
02:05:22,526 --> 02:05:23,920
The child is safe.

933
02:05:26,209 --> 02:05:29,394
When time comes, I'll
show the girl to the world.

936
02:05:33,574 --> 02:05:34,868
Of course.

937
02:05:35,665 --> 02:05:37,357
Rachael got a daughter.

938
02:05:38,949 --> 02:05:41,835
That's how he
comes with my own eyes.

939
02:05:42,831 --> 02:05:45,817
I got him blue when
the departure came.

940
02:05:45,916 --> 02:05:47,807
You hid the boy.

941
02:05:50,097 --> 02:05:52,784
Only a piece of puzzle piece.

942
02:06:09,903 --> 02:06:12,192
Did you think it was you?

943
02:06:15,576 --> 02:06:16,572
You thought.

944
02:06:17,667 --> 02:06:18,662
You thought.

945
02:06:21,946 --> 02:06:23,638
We all liked it as well.

946
02:06:25,629 --> 02:06:27,122
That's why we believe.

947
02:06:44,042 --> 02:06:45,535
<i>Someone says this.</i>

948
02:06:48,322 --> 02:06:52,502
<i>I showed you how to mess
up information, covering traces.</i>

949
02:06:53,000 --> 02:06:55,488
<i>That's how he
comes with my own eyes.</i>

950
02:06:57,180 --> 02:07:00,465
<i>I got him blue when
the departure came.</i>

951
02:07:01,560 --> 02:07:04,446
<i>There is always
something in your job.</i>

952
02:07:42,069 --> 02:07:43,761
That jumps always.

953
02:07:45,353 --> 02:07:48,240
Without thinking of what
you would do on the ground.

954
02:07:49,533 --> 02:07:53,714
Courage can not
change the truth.

955
02:07:58,889 --> 02:08:03,667
I've been wanting
to meet you for so long.

956
02:08:22,379 --> 02:08:24,568
You are a miracle
to me, Mr Deckard.

957
02:08:30,839 --> 02:08:32,033
I had a lock.

958
02:08:34,223 --> 02:08:36,014
I found the key.

959
02:08:37,706 --> 02:08:39,150
But the pins are not in line

960
02:08:39,249 --> 02:08:41,986
and the door stays locked.

961
02:08:44,972 --> 02:08:47,958
I need a sample piece, Mr Deckard.

962
02:08:52,039 --> 02:08:53,034
That child.

963
02:08:54,925 --> 02:08:56,418
I need her baby.

964
02:08:58,011 --> 02:09:00,399
I'm teaching everything to fly.

965
02:09:08,860 --> 02:09:12,343
"God remembered Rachel,

966
02:09:14,732 --> 02:09:15,827
he heard her

967
02:09:17,320 --> 02:09:18,813
and opened her womb. "

968
02:09:19,907 --> 02:09:21,301
<i>Do you hold our owls?</i>

969
02:09:24,287 --> 02:09:25,780
<i>Is it artificial?</i>

970
02:09:27,074 --> 02:09:28,268
<i>Of course it is.</i>

971
02:09:30,458 --> 02:09:31,752
<i>It's probably expensive.</i>

972
02:09:33,941 --> 02:09:34,937
<i>Very.</i>

973
02:09:35,434 --> 02:09:36,728
<i>I'm Rachael.</i>

974
02:09:37,624 --> 02:09:38,719
<i>Deckard.</i>

975
02:09:50,961 --> 02:09:52,155
Is the feeling the same

976
02:09:54,047 --> 02:09:56,137
now than then

977
02:09:59,123 --> 02:10:00,616
when did you meet?

978
02:10:10,967 --> 02:10:17,038
All these years of the
perfection of the memory drilled.

979
02:10:20,621 --> 02:10:22,512
How shiny his lips.

980
02:10:23,010 --> 02:10:25,001
Your immediate contact.

981
02:10:28,783 --> 02:10:32,963
Did you mind that
you were just called?

982
02:10:35,053 --> 02:10:40,428
Planned to fall in love right then.

983
02:10:42,817 --> 02:10:47,893
Make a perfect model.

984
02:10:51,476 --> 02:10:53,865
So if planned.

985
02:10:55,756 --> 02:10:56,751
Love

986
02:10:57,448 --> 02:10:59,836
or mathematical punctuality.

987
02:11:05,808 --> 02:11:06,804
Which

988
02:11:08,097 --> 02:11:09,093
or the camp?

989
02:11:14,069 --> 02:11:15,761
I know what's true.

990
02:11:40,047 --> 02:11:43,132
It was a shame
to keep yourself out.

991
02:11:43,431 --> 02:11:46,616
And it did not
pay like anything.

992
02:11:51,194 --> 02:11:53,085
But you can still help.

993
02:11:54,777 --> 02:11:57,564
You got help hiding.

994
02:12:00,252 --> 02:12:01,546
Where did they go?

995
02:12:03,835 --> 02:12:05,527
I know you know something.

996
02:12:07,020 --> 02:12:08,015
Help me...

997
02:12:09,408 --> 02:12:12,494
and good things can happen.

998
02:12:18,565 --> 02:12:19,959
You have no children.

999
02:12:24,039 --> 02:12:25,035
Is it?

1000
02:12:25,931 --> 02:12:27,921
Millions.

1001
02:12:30,609 --> 02:12:33,395
Do you think I
can only offer pain?

1002
02:12:34,092 --> 02:12:35,386
But I know.

1003
02:12:37,178 --> 02:12:38,372
You love the pain.

1004
02:12:40,163 --> 02:12:44,344
It reminds you of your happiness.

1005
02:12:46,633 --> 02:12:47,827
More luck then.

1006
02:12:54,695 --> 02:12:56,287
Do not be afraid.

1007
02:13:11,516 --> 02:13:12,710
Angel.

1008
02:13:14,203 --> 02:13:15,696
Re-created.

1009
02:13:19,876 --> 02:13:20,872
To you.

1010
02:13:55,309 --> 02:13:56,504
Did you miss me?

1011
02:14:15,016 --> 02:14:16,211
Do not you love me?

1012
02:14:35,619 --> 02:14:36,814
His eyes were green.

1013
02:14:54,630 --> 02:14:55,724
In the outside world

1014
02:14:57,118 --> 02:14:59,706
let me talk to you.

1015
02:15:02,194 --> 02:15:04,185
You do not feel the pain yet.

1016
02:15:06,474 --> 02:15:07,668
But you learn.

1017
02:15:20,109 --> 02:15:21,602
<i>Hello handsome.</i>

1018
02:15:38,821 --> 02:15:41,011
<i>What day, huh?</i>

1019
02:15:44,992 --> 02:15:46,485
<i>Orpo expression.</i>

1020
02:15:47,978 --> 02:15:49,471
<i>I can fix it.</i>

1021
02:15:53,253 --> 02:15:55,941
<i>You look good at the river.</i>

1022
02:16:14,105 --> 02:16:18,086
JOI - ALL YOU WANT
TO BE BEING AND VIEW

1023
02:16:31,075 --> 02:16:36,251
<i>Death for the right thing is the
most human thing we can do.</i>

1024
02:16:39,436 --> 02:16:41,227
<i>Because you have
not seen a miracle.</i>

1025
02:17:20,243 --> 02:17:23,329
<i>Get to the airspace of
Los Angeles Airport.</i>

1026
02:17:23,428 --> 02:17:24,722
<i>Tunnistautukaa.</i>

1027
02:17:24,822 --> 02:17:28,007
Transportation S-14-4-XD.

1028
02:17:33,680 --> 02:17:34,974
Where are we going?

1029
02:17:36,367 --> 02:17:37,462
Home.

1030
02:18:31,806 --> 02:18:36,185
<i>Engine 2 inoperative.
The spare motor is connected.</i>

1031
02:18:37,181 --> 02:18:38,176
<i>Warning.</i>

1032
02:18:38,474 --> 02:18:40,664
Does it work?
- Too low!

1033
02:18:41,659 --> 02:18:42,655
Get back!

1034
02:19:32,022 --> 02:19:33,017
Up.

1035
02:19:57,800 --> 02:19:58,796
Open the door.

1036
02:21:51,465 --> 02:21:52,759
I am the best.

1037
02:22:33,865 --> 02:22:35,059
The outside world is waiting.

1038
02:24:48,331 --> 02:24:49,326
Joe.

1039
02:24:49,824 --> 02:24:50,819
Joe!

1040
02:25:00,872 --> 02:25:01,867
Joe!

1041
02:25:41,381 --> 02:25:43,172
You would have let me die.

1042
02:25:44,566 --> 02:25:45,661
Annoinkin.

1043
02:25:49,940 --> 02:25:51,135
You fucked.

1044
02:25:57,505 --> 02:25:59,097
You can meet your daughter now.

1045
02:27:24,296 --> 02:27:26,187
The best memories are her.

1046
02:27:35,841 --> 02:27:36,837
Why?

1047
02:27:39,823 --> 02:27:41,116
Who am I to you?

1048
02:27:50,970 --> 02:27:52,065
Meet your daughter.

1049
02:27:58,733 --> 02:28:00,027
Are you okay?

1050
02:30:35,693 --> 02:30:36,788
Just a moment.

1051
02:30:39,774 --> 02:30:41,018
Is not it beautiful?

1052
02:31:13,615 --> 02:31:15,605
DO NOT COPY in any format!
