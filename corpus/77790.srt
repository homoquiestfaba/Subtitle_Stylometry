1
00:01:26,409 --> 00:01:29,924
In the beginning, there was nothing.

2
00:01:33,209 --> 00:01:37,839
-Wilderness.
-Worse than wilderness.

3
00:01:38,049 --> 00:01:42,361
Endless raw acreage,
the land infested with crocodiles.

4
00:01:42,569 --> 00:01:45,242
-Alligators.
-Alligators, crocodiles....

5
00:01:45,409 --> 00:01:49,197
For retirement bungalows,
that's not a selling point.

6
00:01:49,369 --> 00:01:52,441
Mosquitoes that would strip you
to the bones.

7
00:01:52,609 --> 00:01:56,682
-Swampland.
-That was 10c an acre. This was worse.

8
00:01:56,849 --> 00:01:59,966
The name means in Seminole:
"Don't go there."

9
00:02:00,129 --> 00:02:01,403
But we bought it.

10
00:02:01,569 --> 00:02:04,481
Because we knew.
You weren't selling land.

11
00:02:04,689 --> 00:02:08,523
I mean, what's land?
A patch of dirt, a tree. Who cares?

12
00:02:08,689 --> 00:02:10,919
Farmers care.

13
00:02:16,289 --> 00:02:17,802
Farmers.

14
00:02:17,969 --> 00:02:22,838
Farmers are for TV ads. People
with tractors, amber waves of grain.

15
00:02:23,009 --> 00:02:25,000
They shoot it all in Canada.

16
00:02:25,169 --> 00:02:30,163
I'm talking about certified accountants
with a fixed pension and a nest egg...

17
00:02:30,369 --> 00:02:33,964
...who don't wanna spend
their golden years in slush.

18
00:02:34,129 --> 00:02:36,768
Dreams are what you sell.
A concept.

19
00:02:36,969 --> 00:02:39,961
You sell sunshine,
you sell orange groves...

20
00:02:40,129 --> 00:02:43,565
...you sell gentle breezes
wafting through the palms.

21
00:02:43,729 --> 00:02:46,562
-There were palm trees?
-In the brochures.

22
00:02:46,729 --> 00:02:49,880
-Stately ones.
-When they came down and saw it?

23
00:02:50,049 --> 00:02:55,077
As long as the dredge stayed ahead
of the buyers, we were in like Flynn.

24
00:02:55,409 --> 00:02:57,559
This was the end of the earth.

25
00:02:57,729 --> 00:03:01,768
This was the land populated
by white people who ate catfish.

26
00:03:01,929 --> 00:03:06,844
Almost overnight,
out of the muck and the mangroves...

27
00:03:07,089 --> 00:03:08,761
...we created this.

28
00:03:10,329 --> 00:03:12,001
Golf courses.

29
00:03:12,169 --> 00:03:15,525
Nature on a leash.

30
00:03:26,769 --> 00:03:29,203
<i>Ahoy. It's that time of year again.</i>

31
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:32,367
<i>The Delrona Chamber of Commerce</i>
<i>invites you...</i>

32
00:03:32,529 --> 00:03:38,240
<i>... to the Buccaneer Days festivities</i>
<i>at the Plantation Island Marina.</i>

33
00:03:38,409 --> 00:03:41,162
<i>Live music,</i>
<i>and plenty of booty for kids.</i>

34
00:03:41,329 --> 00:03:46,164
<i>Plans for the treasure hunt can be</i>
<i>attained at the Delrona Beach Mall....</i>

35
00:04:04,809 --> 00:04:07,642
-Sure this place is okay?
-What do you mean?

36
00:04:07,809 --> 00:04:12,007
-Black people go in here?
-If they're desperate to pee, they do.

37
00:04:12,169 --> 00:04:15,525
-But your mother's is--
-I need to go before then.

38
00:04:15,689 --> 00:04:16,883
Relax.

39
00:04:20,889 --> 00:04:24,120
Take the register,
I gotta get back to the motel.

40
00:04:24,289 --> 00:04:26,166
-Your husband called.
-Ex.

41
00:04:26,329 --> 00:04:27,762
He needs to see you.

42
00:04:27,929 --> 00:04:31,922
Next time, tell him to take
a long walk off a short pier.

43
00:04:33,209 --> 00:04:36,246
-Smoking or non?
-Could I use your bathroom?

44
00:04:36,409 --> 00:04:39,719
-It's straight back to the right.
-Thank you.

45
00:04:45,969 --> 00:04:47,721
Buzzards.

46
00:04:48,329 --> 00:04:50,126
Excuse me.

47
00:04:55,889 --> 00:04:58,528
Hi, there. You been helped yet?

48
00:04:58,689 --> 00:05:01,840
No, my wife's just using
the facilities.

49
00:05:09,049 --> 00:05:11,882
-You need a room?
-Pardon?

50
00:05:12,049 --> 00:05:14,404
You've been gawking at the motel.

51
00:05:14,569 --> 00:05:17,879
We have a few vacancies,
but it'll fill up soon.

52
00:05:18,049 --> 00:05:21,280
-I was looking the property over.
-The property?

53
00:05:21,449 --> 00:05:23,246
The whole strip, actually.

54
00:05:23,409 --> 00:05:27,118
If you're from the County,
we had our sign moved back.

55
00:05:28,329 --> 00:05:33,562
I was just trying to imagine what it
would look like without buildings.

56
00:05:33,729 --> 00:05:37,722
-Kind of mentally undressing it?
-You could say that.

57
00:05:39,729 --> 00:05:45,167
-You work for that Plantation outfit?
-Yes. I'm supervising the expansion--

58
00:05:45,329 --> 00:05:48,321
They don't have enough
of the coast already?

59
00:05:48,489 --> 00:05:51,322
It's just a study,
a what-if kind of thing.

60
00:05:51,489 --> 00:05:57,724
What if I told you my daddy would
never sell to Plantation Estates?

61
00:05:58,569 --> 00:06:01,720
I'll be happy to pass it on.
I'm Jack Meadows.

62
00:06:01,889 --> 00:06:04,767
-You're a developer.
-A landscape architect.

63
00:06:04,929 --> 00:06:09,127
I help them decide what they want,
push some dirt around....

64
00:06:09,289 --> 00:06:14,443
They wanted my opinion
on the whole shoreline here, actually.

65
00:06:14,609 --> 00:06:17,362
-So how's it look?
-What?

66
00:06:17,529 --> 00:06:19,884
Without anything on it?

67
00:06:20,769 --> 00:06:23,078
It looks terrific.

68
00:06:25,009 --> 00:06:29,127
HQ says that'll be our beachhead.
Then we'll take the rest of it.

69
00:06:29,649 --> 00:06:34,484
The other side has this end locked up
and they're infiltrating Lincoln Beach.

70
00:06:34,649 --> 00:06:38,881
-We're not opposing?
-Zoned residential, hostile population.

71
00:06:39,049 --> 00:06:44,521
It's a minefield. Whereas right here
is the soft underbelly of the island.

72
00:06:45,049 --> 00:06:49,440
You make the frontal assault,
I go behind the lines.

73
00:06:49,609 --> 00:06:54,125
-Is somebody on the inside?
-Working on it.

74
00:08:20,049 --> 00:08:21,448
Shit.

75
00:08:21,609 --> 00:08:26,967
Shock and outrage as Delrona Beach
awoke to a senseless act of vandalism.

76
00:08:27,129 --> 00:08:31,407
The <i>Freebooter,</i> the centrepiece
of the Buccaneer Days parade...

77
00:08:31,569 --> 00:08:33,241
...was burnt beyond repair....

78
00:08:33,409 --> 00:08:38,961
This is a disaster. It's always
the lead float in the parade.

79
00:08:39,129 --> 00:08:44,840
Same kid set a fire some years back
in a crab shack on Lincoln Beach.

80
00:08:45,009 --> 00:08:49,082
This is so not in the spirit
of the celebration.

81
00:08:49,289 --> 00:08:51,928
Where do you want me to haul it?

82
00:08:54,689 --> 00:08:56,600
Hello!

83
00:08:57,089 --> 00:08:58,727
Hello?

84
00:09:02,129 --> 00:09:06,600
-Dr. Lloyd.
-Sorry to bother you, Mrs. Pierce.

85
00:09:06,769 --> 00:09:08,407
You're always welcome.

86
00:09:08,569 --> 00:09:13,199
I'm rounding up folks for this
County Commission meeting tonight.

87
00:09:13,369 --> 00:09:19,126
-I know it's very short notice, but--
-I'd like to help, but I feel poorly.

88
00:09:19,529 --> 00:09:22,123
Oh, my! Would you look at this.

89
00:09:24,769 --> 00:09:28,728
It's that boy
poor Mrs. Stokes took in.

90
00:09:28,889 --> 00:09:32,325
-He's in trouble again?
-First her girl went wild...

91
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:36,448
...and run off to God knows where.
And now this.

92
00:09:36,609 --> 00:09:37,803
Some people.

93
00:09:37,969 --> 00:09:42,520
I'm worried about them sneaking
through this public-domain business...

94
00:09:42,689 --> 00:09:44,600
...without us making a showing.

95
00:09:44,769 --> 00:09:48,000
If we can field just
even a dozen residents--

96
00:09:48,169 --> 00:09:51,320
Wasn't it settled
when they took the cemetery?

97
00:09:51,489 --> 00:09:56,722
-I'm afraid it won't stop there.
-Now, who's this coming to call?

98
00:10:03,729 --> 00:10:05,845
It seems kind of deserted.

99
00:10:06,009 --> 00:10:10,127
Yeah, well, you know,
most people come on the weekends.

100
00:10:12,769 --> 00:10:17,923
-Do I look okay?
-Relax. This is gonna be fine.

101
00:10:18,529 --> 00:10:20,520
You don't know her.

102
00:10:24,809 --> 00:10:26,208
Hi.

103
00:10:27,769 --> 00:10:30,681
Is Mrs. Stokes here?

104
00:10:37,489 --> 00:10:39,719
I have no idea.

105
00:10:53,969 --> 00:10:57,405
Well, well. Desiree.

106
00:10:57,609 --> 00:11:01,318
Never thought I'd live
to see you back here.

107
00:11:01,729 --> 00:11:03,321
Hello, Mama.

108
00:11:06,209 --> 00:11:07,608
My Lord.

109
00:11:07,809 --> 00:11:11,040
You did get a handsome one,
didn't you?

110
00:11:14,609 --> 00:11:19,239
Good luck moving this. It's three
inches of soil, then solid limestone.

111
00:11:19,409 --> 00:11:24,039
More work, more pay.
Hey! What do you think you're doing?

112
00:11:24,209 --> 00:11:27,724
-They wanted this one saved.
-Is that right?

113
00:11:28,529 --> 00:11:32,363
What do you think, chief?
That thing gonna make it?

114
00:11:32,529 --> 00:11:35,089
It's part of Mr. Meadows' concept.

115
00:11:35,249 --> 00:11:40,448
The chief's concept is everything
that's not flat gets that way, fast.

116
00:11:40,649 --> 00:11:43,209
Plantation sold this lot
with the tree.

117
00:11:43,369 --> 00:11:48,204
When you crackers head back to Georgia,
there better goddamn still be one.

118
00:11:48,369 --> 00:11:51,327
Used to be this was all Exley family.

119
00:11:51,489 --> 00:11:54,322
Hasn't nothing been planted here
in 100 years.

120
00:11:54,489 --> 00:11:57,959
We wanna satisfy the homeowner's
desire for privacy...

121
00:11:58,129 --> 00:12:01,838
...with the convenience
and the socializing opportunities...

122
00:12:02,009 --> 00:12:04,648
...provided by the village concept.

123
00:12:04,809 --> 00:12:08,597
It doesn't look like much now,
but when Jack's finished--

124
00:12:08,769 --> 00:12:11,408
-What goes here?
-Our main drainage basin.

125
00:12:11,569 --> 00:12:13,127
-It's a lake.
-A lake?

126
00:12:13,289 --> 00:12:17,168
It'll be 14 feet deep.
What we dig out will form a hill.

127
00:12:17,329 --> 00:12:20,127
-With a deluxe home on top of it.
-Deluxe?

128
00:12:20,329 --> 00:12:23,844
With all the amenities:
A river view, the lake.

129
00:12:24,009 --> 00:12:28,287
-Elevation.
-Damn! These bugs gonna be here too?

130
00:12:29,009 --> 00:12:31,284
Anaesthesiologist.

131
00:12:31,449 --> 00:12:36,603
If there's a surgical procedure,
I render the patient unconscious.

132
00:12:36,769 --> 00:12:39,841
You knock people out with gas?

133
00:12:40,009 --> 00:12:42,045
That's pretty much it.

134
00:12:42,209 --> 00:12:46,646
-I'd be afraid not to wake up.
-A lot of people feel that way.

135
00:12:46,809 --> 00:12:50,961
-Reggie's the head of his department.
-Is that right?

136
00:12:51,129 --> 00:12:56,362
And at such a prestigious hospital.
I'll have to tell that to Dr. Lloyd.

137
00:12:56,529 --> 00:13:01,398
-Dr. Lloyd still coming down?
-He lives here now.

138
00:13:01,569 --> 00:13:04,925
His Etta Mae passed some years ago.

139
00:13:05,249 --> 00:13:08,127
You wouldn't have heard that,
would you?

140
00:13:09,169 --> 00:13:12,081
-She doesn't write, she doesn't call.
-Mama.

141
00:13:12,249 --> 00:13:16,003
Girl caught the first thing smoking
and never looked back.

142
00:13:16,169 --> 00:13:19,798
I took the bus, Mama. Not the train.

143
00:13:21,809 --> 00:13:23,845
It's an expression.

144
00:13:26,969 --> 00:13:32,919
Terrell? Go run this gravy through
the microwave again. It's gone cold.

145
00:13:40,169 --> 00:13:45,562
-And who is that?
-Your cousin, Sidney Wilkins' son.

146
00:13:45,729 --> 00:13:49,119
Sidney that married Athena Hines.

147
00:13:49,289 --> 00:13:52,326
Well, why isn't he with them?

148
00:13:54,289 --> 00:13:57,440
She doesn't write, she doesn't call.

149
00:13:57,649 --> 00:14:01,085
I'm surprised she even let on
she got married.

150
00:14:01,249 --> 00:14:05,242
Her own mother doesn't
get invited to the wedding.

151
00:14:05,409 --> 00:14:09,527
It was a civil service, Mama.
It wasn't in church.

152
00:14:14,889 --> 00:14:19,326
-But it's legal?
-It's legal, it's official. Don't worry.

153
00:14:19,489 --> 00:14:23,562
Something they do up there.
What is it?

154
00:14:23,729 --> 00:14:25,162
Boston.

155
00:14:26,329 --> 00:14:29,878
Somehow, I've never been
north of Washington, D.C.

156
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:33,121
You'll just have to come visit us.

157
00:14:37,529 --> 00:14:41,317
When Terrell's out of school,
maybe we'll do that.

158
00:14:42,969 --> 00:14:48,168
How about that, Terrell?
You like to see Boston?

159
00:14:51,089 --> 00:14:55,879
The proposed boundary for Delrona
Beach will incorporate this area...

160
00:14:56,049 --> 00:15:00,884
...including Lincoln Beach all the way
to the Exley Plantation track.

161
00:15:01,049 --> 00:15:02,528
Excuse me.

162
00:15:02,689 --> 00:15:07,763
If you want to make a motion, wait
till Commissioner Pinkney's finished.

163
00:15:07,929 --> 00:15:11,478
-I want to register a protest.
-In regard to what?

164
00:15:11,649 --> 00:15:14,721
This meeting was not
properly advertised.

165
00:15:14,889 --> 00:15:17,005
We met all legal requirements.

166
00:15:17,169 --> 00:15:21,606
You purposely chose a time when our people
would be unable to attend.

167
00:15:21,769 --> 00:15:23,999
The residents of Lincoln Beach?

168
00:15:24,169 --> 00:15:28,048
You know very well many of us
are only here on weekends.

169
00:15:28,209 --> 00:15:30,200
Many are only summer people.

170
00:15:30,369 --> 00:15:34,726
That doesn't deny us the right
to object to this expropriation.

171
00:15:34,889 --> 00:15:39,041
-Incorporation.
-You've already taken a third of our area.

172
00:15:39,209 --> 00:15:41,723
You know that was
a private transaction...

173
00:15:41,969 --> 00:15:45,359
...between Exley Plantation Estates
Planned Community...

174
00:15:45,529 --> 00:15:48,043
...and the individual property owners.

175
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:53,044
This commission didn't know about it
until the plans were submitted.

176
00:15:53,209 --> 00:15:57,441
If you hadn't already approved it,
they wouldn't have gone ahead.

177
00:15:57,609 --> 00:16:02,125
As spokesman for the Exley Corporation,
I object to the implication--

178
00:16:02,289 --> 00:16:06,521
-It has historic significance to us--
-We made several offers to--

179
00:16:06,689 --> 00:16:11,319
A history that this commission
has consistently ignored!

180
00:16:15,489 --> 00:16:18,083
You let them take away our cemetery.

181
00:16:18,249 --> 00:16:23,767
Dr. Lloyd, we're talking old business.
If you dislike the current agenda--

182
00:16:23,929 --> 00:16:27,001
We don't wanna be a part
of Delrona Beach...

183
00:16:27,169 --> 00:16:31,685
...and they've made it clear they
don't want anything to do with us.

184
00:16:31,849 --> 00:16:36,559
If beachfront prices hadn't risen,
there'd be no interest in merging--

185
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:41,644
-The concept of eminent domain--
-Is used to undermine our well-being!

186
00:16:41,809 --> 00:16:44,687
Gentlemen, if we're going
to have a debate...

187
00:16:44,849 --> 00:16:49,525
...I'm going to have to ask you
to follow procedure.

188
00:17:12,009 --> 00:17:15,763
-I'm thinking of going out there again.
-Out where?

189
00:17:15,929 --> 00:17:17,328
Tour.

190
00:17:18,369 --> 00:17:19,927
Golfing?

191
00:17:20,489 --> 00:17:25,244
It's kind of a syndicate.
A couple of dentists, a Buick dealer.

192
00:17:25,409 --> 00:17:29,118
They wanna sponsor me
for a percentage of my winnings.

193
00:17:30,209 --> 00:17:33,838
-How much can you make?
-First you have to qualify.

194
00:17:34,009 --> 00:17:38,685
Then it just depends on where you
stand at the end of each tournament.

195
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:40,999
You did this before?

196
00:17:44,529 --> 00:17:49,478
I tried a couple of years back.
It was fine till I got on the green.

197
00:17:49,649 --> 00:17:51,128
You know...

198
00:17:53,289 --> 00:17:55,359
...Iittle case of the yips.

199
00:17:58,449 --> 00:18:00,167
It's an adrenaline thing.

200
00:18:00,329 --> 00:18:05,608
You're in the middle of the back swing
of your putt, you tighten up and....

201
00:18:06,529 --> 00:18:07,723
Yip.

202
00:18:09,209 --> 00:18:11,120
Something like that.

203
00:18:12,929 --> 00:18:14,999
And you had them bad?

204
00:18:15,169 --> 00:18:18,002
Killer drive,
beautiful approach shot...

205
00:18:18,169 --> 00:18:21,718
...and I just couldn't get
the damn thing in the hole.

206
00:18:21,889 --> 00:18:25,723
That would seriously cut
into your winnings, wouldn't it?

207
00:18:29,529 --> 00:18:34,125
-It's better now?
-I won't know until I get out there.

208
00:18:34,289 --> 00:18:37,247
I can always sink them in practice.

209
00:18:37,409 --> 00:18:39,843
So you'll be travelling a lot.

210
00:18:40,009 --> 00:18:42,125
That's the life.

211
00:18:42,929 --> 00:18:46,444
Are there, like, groupies?

212
00:18:47,969 --> 00:18:50,722
I suppose. If you win.

213
00:18:53,569 --> 00:18:56,925
I never could understand
wanting to watch it.

214
00:18:57,209 --> 00:19:00,997
You know? It's like
those fishing shows on TV.

215
00:19:03,169 --> 00:19:05,524
Does that make you feel bad?

216
00:19:05,809 --> 00:19:10,166
I don't watch people wait on tables
or run the check-in desk.

217
00:19:10,329 --> 00:19:12,320
Right, you don't.

218
00:19:17,809 --> 00:19:19,322
Yip.

219
00:19:26,609 --> 00:19:30,318
-This is too weird.
-Is it what you remember?

220
00:19:30,489 --> 00:19:35,609
It's my room, yeah,
but that boy's been living in here.

221
00:19:35,769 --> 00:19:41,446
We got some serious testosterone
working here. Now, he's what, exactly?

222
00:19:41,609 --> 00:19:44,965
His daddy is my cousin.
Grew up kind of wild.

223
00:19:45,129 --> 00:19:46,926
He's living here because...?

224
00:19:47,089 --> 00:19:52,038
She wants me to drive them downtown
for some kind of hearing tomorrow.

225
00:19:52,609 --> 00:19:56,363
-He's in trouble?
-She's not giving up any information.

226
00:19:56,529 --> 00:19:58,087
Punish me a bit.

227
00:19:58,249 --> 00:20:02,128
-For being gone so long.
-For everything.

228
00:20:02,689 --> 00:20:07,479
She's the one who asked you
to come down, made the first move.

229
00:20:07,649 --> 00:20:09,719
It's too weird.

230
00:20:11,929 --> 00:20:13,840
You can hear the ocean.

231
00:20:19,489 --> 00:20:21,719
I always loved that.

232
00:20:55,809 --> 00:20:57,208
Hey, Lucky.

233
00:21:10,929 --> 00:21:15,445
-They changed all the façades.
-Nobody but tourists shop here now.

234
00:21:15,609 --> 00:21:20,205
-Where do the regular folks go?
-There's a shuttle bus to the mall.

235
00:21:20,369 --> 00:21:22,929
It's just in here.

236
00:21:28,169 --> 00:21:32,321
-This won't take but an hour or so.
-You hope.

237
00:21:39,209 --> 00:21:42,167
Terrell just needs to talk
with somebody.

238
00:21:42,409 --> 00:21:45,526
We'll call you back home
when it's over.

239
00:22:02,329 --> 00:22:06,117
Prettiest beach on the Atlantic coast.

240
00:22:08,729 --> 00:22:10,321
It is pretty.

241
00:22:10,489 --> 00:22:15,563
If you want to help save it, we're
protesting at the groundbreaking.

242
00:22:15,729 --> 00:22:19,881
-I'm just visiting.
-They won't know the difference.

243
00:22:20,049 --> 00:22:23,564
So this is like an ecological thing?

244
00:22:23,729 --> 00:22:27,927
We're trying to save
an endangered species.

245
00:22:28,329 --> 00:22:29,921
Us.

246
00:22:30,489 --> 00:22:33,481
I heard about this place
when I was a kid.

247
00:22:33,649 --> 00:22:35,924
Forties, fifties...

248
00:22:36,889 --> 00:22:38,925
...Lincoln Beach was it.

249
00:22:39,969 --> 00:22:45,248
Only oceanfront in three counties
we were allowed to step onto.

250
00:22:45,409 --> 00:22:50,039
Black folks, I'm talking about
the pillars of the community...

251
00:22:50,209 --> 00:22:54,725
...got together and bought this land,
built the houses.

252
00:22:54,889 --> 00:22:58,199
You'd drive through a couple hundred
miles of redneck sheriffs...

253
00:22:58,369 --> 00:23:03,079
...park your ride on the boardwalk,
step out and just breathe.

254
00:23:03,249 --> 00:23:07,720
Over there was Henry's Lounge.
That place used to jump.

255
00:23:07,969 --> 00:23:12,759
-So, what happened?
-Civil rights happened. Progress.

256
00:23:12,929 --> 00:23:15,762
Used to be you were black,
you'd buy black.

257
00:23:15,929 --> 00:23:21,561
Jim Crow days, you needed a shoeshine,
wanted a taxi to the train station...

258
00:23:21,809 --> 00:23:24,926
...you wanted some ribs,
a fish sandwich...

259
00:23:25,089 --> 00:23:28,843
...chances are a black man
owned the place you got it in.

260
00:23:29,009 --> 00:23:32,922
Now, the drive-thrus serve anybody.

261
00:23:33,089 --> 00:23:34,761
But who owns them?

262
00:23:34,969 --> 00:23:36,527
Not us.

263
00:23:38,449 --> 00:23:42,408
All our people do is wear paper hats
and dip out them fries.

264
00:23:42,569 --> 00:23:47,723
Only thing we got left are
funeral parlours and barbershops.

265
00:23:48,329 --> 00:23:51,526
But now we can do anything.

266
00:23:54,009 --> 00:23:57,524
Them that can get over do fine.

267
00:23:59,849 --> 00:24:02,841
Them that can't are
in a world of trouble.

268
00:24:04,729 --> 00:24:07,607
Tell the judge what you told me.

269
00:24:07,809 --> 00:24:11,768
I said I'm sorry for what I did.
I wasn't thinking right.

270
00:24:11,929 --> 00:24:15,842
You know that sorry won't cut it
in this case, don't you?

271
00:24:16,009 --> 00:24:17,203
Yes, ma'am.

272
00:24:17,369 --> 00:24:20,645
You're still on probation
for a previous offence...

273
00:24:20,809 --> 00:24:24,484
...yet you deliberately
committed this act of vandalism.

274
00:24:24,649 --> 00:24:27,846
Do you have any explanation
for your actions?

275
00:24:28,009 --> 00:24:29,203
No, ma'am.

276
00:24:29,369 --> 00:24:34,568
When somebody destroys something
that stands as a symbol for people...

277
00:24:34,769 --> 00:24:37,727
-...that's desecration.
- It's a wooden pirate.

278
00:24:37,889 --> 00:24:41,677
An icon in this community, nonetheless.

279
00:24:42,569 --> 00:24:48,565
You're almost old enough, given
your record, to be tried as an adult.

280
00:24:48,729 --> 00:24:54,520
You have two strikes against you.
A third, and there will be--

281
00:24:54,689 --> 00:24:59,763
Mrs. Stokes has assured us she'll
maintain control of the situation.

282
00:24:59,929 --> 00:25:02,966
We'd be satisfied,
barring further incidents...

283
00:25:03,209 --> 00:25:07,919
...with an order for counselling,
or possibly community service.

284
00:25:08,089 --> 00:25:11,081
That's very generous of you.

285
00:25:12,649 --> 00:25:17,200
So, young man,
what's it gonna be?

286
00:25:29,649 --> 00:25:31,287
Loretta.

287
00:25:33,809 --> 00:25:35,322
Well....

288
00:25:37,249 --> 00:25:38,568
Look at you.

289
00:25:38,729 --> 00:25:43,883
-Mama said you were still in Delrona.
-Haven't moved an inch.

290
00:25:44,649 --> 00:25:48,039
I saw you on a TV commercial.

291
00:25:48,249 --> 00:25:53,084
I told my kids I went to school with you,
but they didn't believe me.

292
00:25:53,289 --> 00:25:55,928
-You got kids?
-Three of them.

293
00:25:56,089 --> 00:25:58,284
They're getting big.

294
00:25:58,449 --> 00:26:02,920
-It's the first you've been back since--
-I came back for the service...

295
00:26:03,089 --> 00:26:05,444
...when my father passed.

296
00:26:05,609 --> 00:26:11,718
-But I only stayed for a day.
-That's a good while ago, your father.

297
00:26:14,489 --> 00:26:16,957
Kind of slow for you down here.

298
00:26:17,969 --> 00:26:20,642
Look, I....

299
00:26:21,969 --> 00:26:26,679
-I kind of wanted to apologize.
-For what?

300
00:26:27,649 --> 00:26:29,048
For Carter.

301
00:26:31,849 --> 00:26:36,479
That's another lifetime
you're talking about. 25 years.

302
00:26:36,689 --> 00:26:39,726
We were friends.
I shouldn't have gone after him.

303
00:26:39,889 --> 00:26:41,322
But you did.

304
00:26:48,329 --> 00:26:53,483
-You always did what you wanted to.
-I didn't do it to hurt you.

305
00:26:55,369 --> 00:27:00,682
-Ancient history.
-So Carter still in town?

306
00:27:01,809 --> 00:27:06,041
He inside sleeping.
Works nights at the box factory.

307
00:27:06,249 --> 00:27:10,845
-You got married?
-After a while, yeah.

308
00:27:16,649 --> 00:27:19,447
-When you left town--
-When I was sent away.

309
00:27:19,609 --> 00:27:23,079
Everybody thought it was Carter
got you pregnant.

310
00:27:23,729 --> 00:27:25,128
It wasn't.

311
00:27:25,769 --> 00:27:28,488
That's what he's saying nowadays.

312
00:27:28,689 --> 00:27:32,398
I guess I wasn't too worried
about the rumours.

313
00:27:32,569 --> 00:27:36,608
-Made your exit and didn't look back.
-Some drama, huh?

314
00:27:37,809 --> 00:27:41,165
Girl, we ate that shit up.

315
00:27:41,329 --> 00:27:44,446
I had to listen to everybody
run you down...

316
00:27:44,609 --> 00:27:49,160
...being the tragic ex-girlfriend and all.

317
00:27:49,969 --> 00:27:53,359
-Like that was gonna make me feel better.
-And Carter?

318
00:27:56,449 --> 00:27:59,441
-Carter ran around acting the daddy.
-Really?

319
00:27:59,609 --> 00:28:05,286
Better you knock your girl up than to
have people think somebody else did it.

320
00:28:06,849 --> 00:28:10,080
But it all turned out fine, didn't it?

321
00:28:12,089 --> 00:28:15,684
I suppose I could've done worse.

322
00:28:16,969 --> 00:28:20,405
So you're the one who finally
snagged Desiree Stokes?

323
00:28:20,569 --> 00:28:22,321
I'm the one.

324
00:28:22,489 --> 00:28:26,687
-That girl drew men like flies.
-I can imagine.

325
00:28:26,849 --> 00:28:29,841
-Elton Lloyd.
-Reginald Perry.

326
00:28:30,009 --> 00:28:33,206
We're staying at her mother's
for a few days.

327
00:28:33,489 --> 00:28:37,880
A wonderful woman, Eunice.
A true Christian.

328
00:28:39,649 --> 00:28:43,437
Now her nephew, is it?

329
00:28:44,529 --> 00:28:46,360
Her nephew's son.

330
00:28:47,009 --> 00:28:49,125
Young Terrell.

331
00:28:49,809 --> 00:28:55,167
I blame it on the drugs.
It's a pestilence.

332
00:28:55,329 --> 00:28:58,605
Something happened with his...?

333
00:28:58,849 --> 00:29:02,524
-Eunice didn't tell you?
-She and Desiree haven't been....

334
00:29:02,729 --> 00:29:08,167
-If you ask, you don't deserve to know.
-Seems to be the attitude.

335
00:29:09,489 --> 00:29:12,799
Terrell's father was going
through a rough stretch.

336
00:29:12,969 --> 00:29:15,927
He had separated from his wife.

337
00:29:16,089 --> 00:29:20,480
He came over one day
high on who knows what.

338
00:29:20,649 --> 00:29:25,643
They had a screaming argument,
he had a weapon.

339
00:29:25,809 --> 00:29:32,123
He shot that woman dead,
then turned the gun on himself.

340
00:29:32,289 --> 00:29:36,123
Horrible thing to witness.

341
00:29:36,289 --> 00:29:40,840
-Terrell must have been 6, maybe 7.
-He saw it?

342
00:29:41,049 --> 00:29:47,079
He sat with the bodies for two days
before somebody came over and found him.

343
00:29:47,969 --> 00:29:50,199
It's a pestilence.

344
00:29:52,969 --> 00:29:56,962
Afternoon, gentlemen.
Y'all know where Buster's Place is?

345
00:29:57,129 --> 00:30:01,759
Buster's Place is long gone, brother.
Nothing there now.

346
00:30:01,929 --> 00:30:03,681
You sure?

347
00:30:04,529 --> 00:30:06,565
I know you.

348
00:30:07,569 --> 00:30:11,562
-I don't think so.
-Sure, I do.

349
00:30:11,729 --> 00:30:14,402
You used to be the Florida Flash.

350
00:30:20,649 --> 00:30:24,164
In my day, life was simpler.

351
00:30:24,969 --> 00:30:27,847
You knew where you stood.

352
00:30:28,609 --> 00:30:33,080
A man was left to make his own way
in the world.

353
00:30:34,889 --> 00:30:39,246
You didn't have none of these
pressure groups, advocate groups...

354
00:30:39,409 --> 00:30:44,278
...special-interest groups
handicapping the race.

355
00:30:45,249 --> 00:30:49,720
It went to the smartest,
the strongest, the swiftest.

356
00:30:50,409 --> 00:30:53,606
If a man could carve out
something for himself...

357
00:30:53,769 --> 00:30:56,841
...he knowed he'd earned it.

358
00:30:59,649 --> 00:31:02,482
No whooping crane.

359
00:31:02,969 --> 00:31:05,437
Spotted owl.

360
00:31:07,889 --> 00:31:10,847
The Florida gator.

361
00:31:11,409 --> 00:31:16,164
The coloured man, the white man,
the Spanish.

362
00:31:16,329 --> 00:31:19,924
They all started out from scratch.

363
00:31:20,089 --> 00:31:23,798
If you couldn't survive the course,
it was tough titty.

364
00:31:23,969 --> 00:31:27,279
Nowadays, what they got?

365
00:31:27,849 --> 00:31:31,285
It ain't natural.

366
00:31:31,849 --> 00:31:37,685
They got us so zoned.
Regulated.

367
00:31:37,849 --> 00:31:42,206
Politically corrected and
environmentally sensitised...

368
00:31:42,369 --> 00:31:47,682
...to the point where it's only
multi-internationals with 12 lawyers...

369
00:31:47,849 --> 00:31:51,364
...waiting like buzzards
for something to litigate...

370
00:31:51,529 --> 00:31:55,522
...that can afford to put one brick
on top of another.

371
00:31:56,569 --> 00:32:02,758
The little guy, no matter how much
grit or imagination he brings to it...

372
00:32:02,929 --> 00:32:08,845
...ain't got a chance. They got him
tied down so he can't hardly breathe.

373
00:32:11,009 --> 00:32:16,037
You smoke a damn cigarette, they
make you feel like a baby-strangler.

374
00:32:16,329 --> 00:32:21,084
Where's it all gonna end?
I don't want to know.

375
00:32:22,649 --> 00:32:28,201
But if they expect my cooperation,
they're just shit out of luck.

376
00:32:28,369 --> 00:32:34,046
The reason I hang on to this old bag of
bones is to spite the sons of bitches.

377
00:32:35,369 --> 00:32:38,725
They made me put into Social Security
for 50 years.

378
00:32:38,889 --> 00:32:44,566
I ain't giving up the ghost till I spend
every damn penny of it.

379
00:32:46,849 --> 00:32:51,081
-Which one are you?
-Gwendolyn.

380
00:32:51,249 --> 00:32:57,597
-You think I'm full of crap, don't you?
-It's time for your insulin, Mr. Temple.

381
00:32:58,329 --> 00:33:01,844
There's an opening here
that could close up quick.

382
00:33:02,009 --> 00:33:06,127
-My father is the owner.
-I understand he's currently indisposed.

383
00:33:06,289 --> 00:33:09,201
He's legally blind, if that's what you mean.

384
00:33:09,369 --> 00:33:13,726
The black folks on Lincoln Beach have
contacted the Historical Register.

385
00:33:13,889 --> 00:33:15,322
That's their business.

386
00:33:15,489 --> 00:33:20,199
Draw that kind of attention,
environmentalists come in on their heels.

387
00:33:20,369 --> 00:33:22,280
They're pesky little buggers.

388
00:33:22,449 --> 00:33:26,681
Then you won't be able to sell
your property for what it's worth.

389
00:33:26,849 --> 00:33:29,682
-What's it worth?
-Not much at the moment.

390
00:33:29,849 --> 00:33:34,525
And since the resort condos have come in,
your taxes have jumped 30%.

391
00:33:34,689 --> 00:33:39,285
-Small businesses are being squeezed.
-Tell me about it.

392
00:33:41,409 --> 00:33:45,960
We realize this is a big decision,
one of the oldest businesses left...

393
00:33:46,129 --> 00:33:49,917
-...going back generations.
-You're not from the Plantation?

394
00:33:50,089 --> 00:33:52,967
-Some men were here.
-Did they make an offer?

395
00:33:53,129 --> 00:33:56,166
-Sniffing around, I guess.
-They're relentless.

396
00:33:56,329 --> 00:33:58,604
And you're not?

397
00:33:58,769 --> 00:34:03,604
The Exley Plantation is only for the
elite. What we have in mind is more...

398
00:34:03,769 --> 00:34:08,524
-...democratic. Something for everybody.
-Stores, burger chains, T-shirts?

399
00:34:08,689 --> 00:34:12,159
-Retail outlets would be part of it--
-123 empty?

400
00:34:12,369 --> 00:34:17,204
-Should be. Your husband called.
-I don't need to talk to him.

401
00:34:17,369 --> 00:34:21,965
You want to develop here, you need
the County Commission in your pocket.

402
00:34:22,169 --> 00:34:24,046
We can work something out.

403
00:34:24,249 --> 00:34:30,643
Testing, one, two, three.
This is a mike check. One, two, three.

404
00:34:33,129 --> 00:34:37,168
Good afternoon, and welcome
to Delrona Beach's...

405
00:34:37,329 --> 00:34:41,083
...annual Buccaneer Days.

406
00:34:56,969 --> 00:34:59,244
Earl. Earl!

407
00:34:59,769 --> 00:35:03,557
-Steve. I'll be right with you.
-I got those signatures.

408
00:35:03,889 --> 00:35:06,244
Just give me a minute.

409
00:35:27,769 --> 00:35:30,886
In the afternoon,
when school was out...

410
00:35:31,049 --> 00:35:35,406
...and the last one had left
with his dirty little snuffling nose...

411
00:35:35,569 --> 00:35:40,040
...instead of going home, I would go
down the hill to the spring...

412
00:35:40,209 --> 00:35:44,248
...where I could be quiet
and hate them.

413
00:35:44,409 --> 00:35:46,559
It would be quiet there then...

414
00:35:46,729 --> 00:35:51,678
...with the water bubbling up and away
and the sun slanting in the trees...

415
00:35:51,849 --> 00:35:57,606
...and the quiet smelling of damp
and rotting leaves and new earth.

416
00:35:57,769 --> 00:36:01,284
Especially in the early spring.
For it was worse then.

417
00:36:01,449 --> 00:36:05,920
I could remember my father used to say
that the reason for living...

418
00:36:06,089 --> 00:36:11,846
...was to get ready to stay dead
a good long time.

419
00:36:13,089 --> 00:36:17,685
And when I would have to look at them
day after day...

420
00:36:17,849 --> 00:36:22,081
...each with his and her
secret and selfish thought...

421
00:36:22,249 --> 00:36:26,686
...and blood strange to each other
and strange to mine.

422
00:36:26,849 --> 00:36:30,398
And to think that this
was the only way...

423
00:36:30,569 --> 00:36:33,561
...I could stay dead.

424
00:36:33,729 --> 00:36:38,757
I would hate my father
for planting me.

425
00:36:38,929 --> 00:36:41,443
And then I go on from there.

426
00:36:41,609 --> 00:36:44,077
The important thing is...

427
00:36:44,249 --> 00:36:48,925
...to freeze yourself
in an interesting...

428
00:36:49,089 --> 00:36:53,765
...but comfortable position.
Jaime, you're about to fall over.

429
00:37:00,809 --> 00:37:04,848
We'll resume tomorrow.
You should be off book by then.

430
00:37:05,009 --> 00:37:08,968
I thank you all very much
for your work today.

431
00:37:19,289 --> 00:37:23,726
-It is you, isn't it?
-Hello, Miss Delia.

432
00:37:29,009 --> 00:37:31,443
It's really you.

433
00:37:34,609 --> 00:37:38,204
It is so wonderful to see you.

434
00:37:38,369 --> 00:37:41,406
My mother told me
you were still running this.

435
00:37:41,569 --> 00:37:43,799
They'll have to drag me off.

436
00:37:43,969 --> 00:37:48,520
Several members of the local press
have suggested that very thing.

437
00:37:48,889 --> 00:37:53,804
These are my special group.
Young people with difficulties.

438
00:37:53,969 --> 00:37:56,529
-What's the play?
<i>-As I Lay Dying.</i>

439
00:37:56,689 --> 00:38:01,558
Rather loosely adapted, but I don't
believe Mr. Faulkner would object.

440
00:38:02,969 --> 00:38:07,724
-The scene of your many triumphs.
-I let you down.

441
00:38:07,889 --> 00:38:13,202
-Whatever do you mean?
-When I left. I was the lead.

442
00:38:13,369 --> 00:38:17,521
Well, we did have to make
a few adjustments.

443
00:38:17,689 --> 00:38:19,998
But the show must go on.

444
00:38:20,169 --> 00:38:22,239
You played it?

445
00:38:22,409 --> 00:38:26,448
Having a queen of Egypt
considerably older than her Antony...

446
00:38:26,609 --> 00:38:29,442
...was very provocative.

447
00:38:29,609 --> 00:38:34,000
I got to do it once when I got
to New York. In the Park.

448
00:38:34,169 --> 00:38:37,923
I played the handmaiden
who gives her the asp.

449
00:38:38,129 --> 00:38:42,680
I'm sure you were wonderful.
And now?

450
00:38:42,849 --> 00:38:47,923
I trust you're still sharing
your talent with the public?

451
00:38:48,089 --> 00:38:52,321
I do industrials. Representing things.

452
00:38:52,489 --> 00:38:54,445
I do a lot of auto shows.

453
00:38:54,609 --> 00:39:00,639
A temporary engagement in the world
of commerce. You're still so young.

454
00:39:00,809 --> 00:39:04,484
I had my chance, Miss Delia.
It just didn't happen.

455
00:39:05,329 --> 00:39:08,958
I must say, my youthful aspirations
had nothing to do...

456
00:39:09,129 --> 00:39:12,838
...with becoming the Sarah Bernhardt
of Delrona Beach.

457
00:39:13,009 --> 00:39:15,443
We adjust.

458
00:39:18,129 --> 00:39:21,758
You would've been stunning
as Cleopatra.

459
00:39:21,929 --> 00:39:24,397
I was starting to show.

460
00:39:24,569 --> 00:39:26,400
I played Juliet...

461
00:39:26,569 --> 00:39:31,040
...when I was five-months pregnant
with my twins.

462
00:39:32,529 --> 00:39:34,599
Hello there, come on in.

463
00:39:36,129 --> 00:39:39,599
-You remember my mother?
-Mrs. Temple.

464
00:39:39,769 --> 00:39:41,361
So nice to see you.

465
00:39:42,969 --> 00:39:47,645
And this is my-- This is Terrell.
Terrell is....

466
00:39:47,809 --> 00:39:51,563
-It's sort of a favour.
-Whatever I can do.

467
00:39:51,889 --> 00:39:55,677
The social worker down
at the courthouse recommended you...

468
00:39:55,849 --> 00:39:59,125
-...because you have a program--
-For community service.

469
00:39:59,289 --> 00:40:04,363
I can always use another volunteer.
Do you have any acting experience?

470
00:40:04,529 --> 00:40:09,762
-No, ma'am.
-But he knows how to use tools.

471
00:40:09,929 --> 00:40:14,241
Anything you can think of,
Terrell can put it together.

472
00:40:14,409 --> 00:40:18,482
Then you can do me a great service,
Terrell.

473
00:40:18,649 --> 00:40:21,288
My character, Addie Bundren,
is deceased.

474
00:40:21,449 --> 00:40:25,237
In the second act, I rise from the dead
for my soliloquy...

475
00:40:25,409 --> 00:40:30,881
...but the local funeral parlour
has nothing suitably rustic.

476
00:40:32,169 --> 00:40:35,286
Do you think you could you build me
a coffin?

477
00:40:37,169 --> 00:40:41,447
"We hereby claim sovereignty
over this island...

478
00:40:41,609 --> 00:40:45,602
...in the name of his majesty,
Philip el Segundo of Spain.

479
00:40:45,769 --> 00:40:49,603
Furthermore, this tribunal declares
the mulatto, Calavera...

480
00:40:49,769 --> 00:40:54,763
...otherwise known as Captain Skull,
guilty of piracy on the high seas...

481
00:40:54,929 --> 00:40:59,844
...a crime against God and nature, and
sentence him to be cast into the sea...

482
00:41:00,049 --> 00:41:02,279
...there to perish by drowning."

483
00:41:02,449 --> 00:41:05,521
Does the condemned have
a final statement?

484
00:41:05,689 --> 00:41:08,681
A curse on the lot of you.

485
00:41:08,849 --> 00:41:11,568
Up the Jolly Roger!

486
00:41:25,929 --> 00:41:29,444
Thus was the black flag
of the buccaneer...

487
00:41:29,609 --> 00:41:32,760
...replaced by that
of Imperial Spain...

488
00:41:32,929 --> 00:41:35,523
...one of many reversals of fortune...

489
00:41:35,689 --> 00:41:39,807
...that mark the colourful history
of our community.

490
00:41:39,969 --> 00:41:44,281
We'd like to thank Presto Pools
for the equipment, and remind you...

491
00:41:44,449 --> 00:41:49,398
...that the annual Treasure Hunt
will begin tomorrow at the Delrona Mall.

492
00:41:49,569 --> 00:41:55,405
Entrants should meet
at the Piercing Pagoda at 10:00.

493
00:41:57,369 --> 00:42:01,601
-Guess who I met earlier?
-You're not telling people I'm back?

494
00:42:01,769 --> 00:42:04,522
I didn't recognize him without the helmet.

495
00:42:04,689 --> 00:42:08,238
But you remember a football player
named Flash Phillips?

496
00:42:25,809 --> 00:42:28,403
Every step we take is on someone's toes.

497
00:42:28,569 --> 00:42:32,847
This town expects me to work miracles
with a handful of volunteers.

498
00:42:33,009 --> 00:42:37,878
This bunch from Lincoln Beach say
they're gonna picket our groundbreaking.

499
00:42:38,049 --> 00:42:43,885
-They complain about parking....
-The whole point is to be away from that.

500
00:42:44,049 --> 00:42:49,328
-This afternoon was embarrassing.
-What? No! I thought it went fine.

501
00:42:49,489 --> 00:42:52,526
-For a Chamber of Commerce thing.
-Nobody came.

502
00:42:52,689 --> 00:42:56,284
-Turnout was terrific.
-Something isn't clicking.

503
00:42:56,449 --> 00:43:00,920
I worked this one place,
they had the blessing of the fleet.

504
00:43:01,089 --> 00:43:06,482
A bishop in his hat,
boats all dolled up. What a draw.

505
00:43:06,649 --> 00:43:09,209
-I can't do religious here.
-True.

506
00:43:09,529 --> 00:43:13,727
And what's our fleet? A bunch
of charter boats and day sailers.

507
00:43:13,889 --> 00:43:17,882
-You got history to burn.
-People hate history.

508
00:43:18,049 --> 00:43:22,600
You got Indians, pirates,
Spanish gold, that plantation thing.

509
00:43:22,769 --> 00:43:25,283
Mass murder, rape, slavery.

510
00:43:25,449 --> 00:43:30,284
So Disneyfy it a little, and they'll
come back. All you need is a hook.

511
00:43:30,449 --> 00:43:34,840
I once worked this place in Wisconsin.
It was all built on wurst.

512
00:43:35,009 --> 00:43:38,763
-Wurst?
-Weisswurst, Bratwurst, Knackwurst.

513
00:43:38,929 --> 00:43:41,762
Bavarian people.
Lots of strudel shops...

514
00:43:41,929 --> 00:43:45,399
...and service people
in leather shorts and dirndls.

515
00:43:45,569 --> 00:43:49,084
-And this worked?
-The beer got them in the mood.

516
00:43:49,249 --> 00:43:53,162
-Free liquor.
-I like a woman in a dirndl.

517
00:43:53,329 --> 00:43:57,686
I hired this guy to be an attraction.
He used to be a big Seminole.

518
00:43:57,849 --> 00:44:03,128
-Indian?
-Not the Seminoles! The Seminoles.

519
00:44:03,289 --> 00:44:04,722
The football team?

520
00:44:04,889 --> 00:44:08,643
Of course. What would I want
with a real Indian?

521
00:44:08,809 --> 00:44:13,280
He used to be a big deal. Hung out
at Lincoln Beach, drove a Mustang....

522
00:44:13,449 --> 00:44:18,364
-A local hero! That's good.
-I just hope he shows up.

523
00:44:24,409 --> 00:44:27,958
-What's his favourite thing to eat?
-Small children.

524
00:44:28,169 --> 00:44:30,683
Is he alive?

525
00:44:31,689 --> 00:44:34,840
-Can't hardly say.
-Why show a dead alligator?

526
00:44:35,049 --> 00:44:38,724
Did you pay anything to look at him?
Then don't complain.

527
00:44:38,889 --> 00:44:43,679
-He was the last of the Mohicans.
-No, they were already extinct.

528
00:44:43,849 --> 00:44:47,319
He was a Shawnee or Pawnee.
Here's Billy, he'll know.

529
00:44:47,489 --> 00:44:50,401
-Chief!
-Yo, asshole.

530
00:44:50,569 --> 00:44:54,198
What kind of Indian was that guy
on <i>Daniel Boone</i>?

531
00:44:54,369 --> 00:44:57,884
-He was Jewish.
-I don't mean the actor, the character.

532
00:44:58,049 --> 00:45:01,883
-How should I know?
-Aren't you a full-blooded whatever?

533
00:45:02,049 --> 00:45:05,598
-Creek.
-Regular Creek or shit creek?

534
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:08,522
-So where was Daniel Boone?
-In the woods.

535
00:45:08,689 --> 00:45:12,921
More specific than that.
Can't you tell by Indian lore?

536
00:45:13,089 --> 00:45:16,286
-Lore?
-You know, like the trees or something?

537
00:45:16,449 --> 00:45:20,727
-What the hell do I know about trees?
-Didn't your ancestors--?

538
00:45:20,889 --> 00:45:24,438
My parents sold lawn ornaments
to stupid white people.

539
00:45:24,609 --> 00:45:29,285
-You're shitting me.
-Get you a good deal on ceramic ducks.

540
00:45:29,449 --> 00:45:34,762
-I couldn't really pin her down.
-But you planted the idea in her head?

541
00:45:34,929 --> 00:45:37,045
She said her father decided.

542
00:45:37,209 --> 00:45:40,758
Last thing we need is to deal
with some old gomer.

543
00:45:40,929 --> 00:45:42,965
-The mother?
-No, she's a flake.

544
00:45:43,129 --> 00:45:46,007
She runs a theatre group,
finds homes for retired greyhounds.

545
00:45:46,169 --> 00:45:48,683
She never set foot in the restaurant.

546
00:45:48,849 --> 00:45:52,364
She won't be any help,
but she won't get in the way.

547
00:45:52,529 --> 00:45:57,728
-So we're back to the daughter.
-The old man ran the show 24-7.

548
00:45:57,889 --> 00:46:02,360
The daughter, she's paying four people
to handle the same load.

549
00:46:02,529 --> 00:46:06,283
-She wants a life.
-Her rack rate is too low for that.

550
00:46:06,449 --> 00:46:09,566
-The restaurant.
-The restaurant's a wash.

551
00:46:09,729 --> 00:46:14,598
You know the money a successful
franchise could make in that spot?

552
00:46:14,769 --> 00:46:20,127
-All she's doing is taking up space.
-Now she's taking up space at the bar.

553
00:46:21,089 --> 00:46:25,605
You see?
This is not a dedicated professional.

554
00:46:31,769 --> 00:46:34,920
You're not having another of those?

555
00:46:37,889 --> 00:46:41,802
-Saw Steve at the pirate thing today.
-They hang him?

556
00:46:42,009 --> 00:46:43,647
Walked the plank.

557
00:46:43,809 --> 00:46:47,688
-He needs to talk to you.
-Why doesn't he come by the motel?

558
00:46:48,169 --> 00:46:53,721
Maybe due to the restraining order?
You had him arrested in the parking lot.

559
00:46:53,889 --> 00:46:57,484
-He was drunk as a skunk.
-He's club soda and lime now.

560
00:46:57,649 --> 00:47:03,360
-Why do you always wanna defend him?
-I'm not. I'm just saying he's on the wagon.

561
00:47:05,729 --> 00:47:09,722
-Your golf pro was in the other night.
-Not my golf pro.

562
00:47:09,889 --> 00:47:14,405
He's 10 years younger than me.
Besides, he's going on tour.

563
00:47:14,569 --> 00:47:17,129
Like Tiger Woods on TV?

564
00:47:17,289 --> 00:47:20,998
I don't think he'll get as much airtime
as Tiger.

565
00:47:21,169 --> 00:47:26,323
-Did he ask you to go with him?
-It didn't come up.

566
00:47:27,129 --> 00:47:28,881
You want to?

567
00:47:38,449 --> 00:47:41,441
A guy over there has been
checking you out.

568
00:47:41,609 --> 00:47:44,328
Be still, my beating heart.

569
00:47:45,689 --> 00:47:48,726
-What's he look like?
-Not bad.

570
00:47:48,889 --> 00:47:51,926
-Tattoos?
-None visible.

571
00:47:52,089 --> 00:47:55,684
Shirt say "Go Gators"
or "Stomp 'em, Seminoles"?

572
00:47:55,849 --> 00:47:59,125
-It doesn't say anything.
-Obviously not my type.

573
00:47:59,329 --> 00:48:00,967
He's cute.

574
00:48:02,089 --> 00:48:07,368
I'm gonna turn around only to see what
falls under your definition of cute.

575
00:48:08,249 --> 00:48:13,482
If you're at 12:00,
he's about 3:30.

576
00:48:30,289 --> 00:48:34,077
Trying to imagine what it would be
like without us crackers?

577
00:48:34,249 --> 00:48:37,400
-You're everywhere.
-Small island.

578
00:48:39,769 --> 00:48:44,285
I didn't mean to be intrusive before.
I thought they'd contacted you.

579
00:48:44,449 --> 00:48:49,603
Don't worry about it. There's days I imagine
it all blowing away in a hurricane.

580
00:48:50,329 --> 00:48:55,881
-Must be a lot of work being a hotelier.
-Motelier. And we got the restaurant.

581
00:48:56,049 --> 00:48:59,758
-I hated working there as a kid.
-And now?

582
00:48:59,929 --> 00:49:03,444
I got three girls working for me
hate it as much as I do.

583
00:49:03,609 --> 00:49:06,965
-Why do you...?
-Poetic justice. What are you drinking?

584
00:49:07,169 --> 00:49:10,684
-Draft. How about you?
-Shots. Tequila.

585
00:49:10,849 --> 00:49:14,159
If you're gonna drink,
why fuck around?

586
00:49:18,409 --> 00:49:20,764
You're from up north.

587
00:49:20,929 --> 00:49:23,966
They say everybody here is
from somewhere else.

588
00:49:24,129 --> 00:49:28,520
-Not me. I'm sixth generation. At least.
-That's impressive.

589
00:49:28,689 --> 00:49:33,205
You go back that far, your people were
planters, slaves or fugitives.

590
00:49:33,369 --> 00:49:34,358
Yours were...?

591
00:49:34,529 --> 00:49:37,839
I don't know what they were running
from, but this is where they stopped.

592
00:49:38,009 --> 00:49:42,605
-I'm from Newport, Rhode Island.
-With the yachts and big estates?

593
00:49:42,769 --> 00:49:45,522
My dad took care of the lawns.

594
00:49:48,889 --> 00:49:52,962
-So you've never left the island?
-Sure, I left all right.

595
00:49:53,129 --> 00:49:56,360
-You're looking at a Weeki Wachee girl.
-What?

596
00:49:56,529 --> 00:50:01,364
It's a show.
It's been running since the late '40s.

597
00:50:02,249 --> 00:50:07,039
-You acted?
-Performed. You do it underwater.

598
00:50:07,209 --> 00:50:10,087
Let's have a contest.

599
00:50:15,409 --> 00:50:18,446
You do it to me.

600
00:50:35,649 --> 00:50:38,846
This isn't the guy I meant.

601
00:50:51,369 --> 00:50:52,882
You win.

602
00:51:00,169 --> 00:51:03,798
I could hold it twice as long
if I hadn't been drinking.

603
00:51:03,969 --> 00:51:08,645
The important thing is to keep a smile,
even with water down your nose.

604
00:51:08,809 --> 00:51:12,518
-How long did you work there?
-Three years.

605
00:51:12,689 --> 00:51:16,125
And then I met my ex.

606
00:51:16,769 --> 00:51:20,159
-He had this band. Skeeter Meter.
-Like a rock band?

607
00:51:20,329 --> 00:51:24,402
They were big around Tampa.
You listen to the Allman Brothers?

608
00:51:24,569 --> 00:51:28,357
Lynyrd Skynyrd?
Then you've heard Skeeter Meter.

609
00:51:29,769 --> 00:51:33,682
He was Greek and good-looking.

610
00:51:33,849 --> 00:51:37,080
His daddy was a sponge diver
before they died out.

611
00:51:37,289 --> 00:51:39,883
-What did they die of?
-Boredom.

612
00:51:41,089 --> 00:51:46,004
Hanging on to some rock,
soaking up whatever rolls over you.

613
00:51:46,169 --> 00:51:50,720
-Almost as bad as Delrona Beach.
-There's a lot of changes happening.

614
00:51:50,889 --> 00:51:54,086
Things might pick up.

615
00:51:55,929 --> 00:51:58,523
Don't hold your breath.

616
00:51:59,689 --> 00:52:03,841
They used to say folks around here
only worshipped three people:

617
00:52:04,009 --> 00:52:07,922
The father, the son
and the Florida Flash.

618
00:52:08,089 --> 00:52:12,367
The day he got hurt, I must have
run the replay 100 times.

619
00:52:12,529 --> 00:52:15,407
He stopped coming up here.
Left school.

620
00:52:16,249 --> 00:52:20,481
So you were
one of the adoring masses?

621
00:52:21,249 --> 00:52:26,084
I was in high school, he was on
national TV. What do you think?

622
00:52:28,929 --> 00:52:32,239
That's some heavy story about Terrell.

623
00:52:39,609 --> 00:52:44,888
A big responsibility she's taken on,
a kid like that.

624
00:52:46,489 --> 00:52:51,358
-So can you help him?
-Me?

625
00:52:51,529 --> 00:52:56,319
-What am I, a shrink?
-I mean help him build this thing.

626
00:52:56,489 --> 00:53:00,846
Carpentry and adolescent psychology,
two things I know nothing about.

627
00:53:01,009 --> 00:53:04,763
Try, okay? For me.

628
00:53:06,609 --> 00:53:09,328
I'll do what I can.

629
00:53:16,009 --> 00:53:21,367
-Maybe we'll head back on Monday.
-We just got here.

630
00:53:21,529 --> 00:53:27,559
I don't want to get sucked in to any
of this. I don't like who I am down here.

631
00:53:30,289 --> 00:53:33,725
And I don't trust my mother.

632
00:53:41,889 --> 00:53:44,608
Is that you, Elton?

633
00:53:54,649 --> 00:53:57,959
I'm amazed at how little sleep
I need these days.

634
00:53:58,129 --> 00:54:01,246
You've got restless feet.
Always have.

635
00:54:04,689 --> 00:54:07,999
Sorry I couldn't be there
for you at the meeting.

636
00:54:08,169 --> 00:54:11,718
You had your emergency.
How'd the hearing go?

637
00:54:11,889 --> 00:54:17,088
He's still on probation.
He has to do community service.

638
00:54:17,329 --> 00:54:20,241
Could have been much worse.

639
00:54:20,529 --> 00:54:23,123
We can fall so quickly.

640
00:54:23,289 --> 00:54:25,598
It's just a stumble, not a fall.

641
00:54:26,929 --> 00:54:30,558
If you could just go and get it
and hand it to them.

642
00:54:30,729 --> 00:54:35,883
-Nobody handed us anything.
-Of course they did.

643
00:54:36,049 --> 00:54:40,440
People fought their whole lives
to keep their heads above water.

644
00:54:40,609 --> 00:54:43,521
We got to start on dry land.

645
00:54:45,489 --> 00:54:51,280
-So Desiree's back?
-Visiting. She's not back.

646
00:54:53,809 --> 00:54:56,528
Hurricane Desiree.

647
00:54:57,569 --> 00:55:02,484
The nights I sat here wondering
where that girl could be.

648
00:55:05,409 --> 00:55:10,278
We used to come out here and neck
when I was in high school.

649
00:55:10,449 --> 00:55:13,327
Then they had these lights in.

650
00:55:13,929 --> 00:55:15,487
Security.

651
00:55:17,089 --> 00:55:20,081
It's more like birth control.

652
00:55:24,849 --> 00:55:31,038
-You do golf courses?
-Design them? No, that's a specialty.

653
00:55:31,209 --> 00:55:35,805
-Do you play it?
-Golf? No.

654
00:56:08,889 --> 00:56:11,722
I gotta tell you...

655
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:17,807
...sex with me when I'm this drunk
is like being at the dentist.

656
00:56:18,849 --> 00:56:24,048
-The dentist?
-When they shoot you up with Novocain.

657
00:56:24,209 --> 00:56:30,000
You can tell something's going on
in there but you don't know what it is.

658
00:56:30,169 --> 00:56:34,287
-I understand.
-So forget it.

659
00:56:35,129 --> 00:56:38,360
It wouldn't cross my mind.

660
00:57:00,889 --> 00:57:04,928
Tomorrow I won't even remember
I kissed you.

661
00:57:08,089 --> 00:57:11,126
I'll come by and remind you.

662
00:57:11,609 --> 00:57:13,201
Do that.

663
00:57:17,769 --> 00:57:23,127
-You honestly don't golf?
-Never took it up.

664
00:57:23,289 --> 00:57:24,768
Good.

665
00:57:34,929 --> 00:57:39,286
The important thing is
to keep that smile on your face...

666
00:57:40,049 --> 00:57:42,961
...even if you're drowning.

667
00:58:04,729 --> 00:58:08,517
-The polar icecap is melting.
-This is news?

668
00:58:08,689 --> 00:58:14,400
They say with this global warming,
the icecap, Antarctica could melt.

669
00:58:14,569 --> 00:58:19,359
-And the oceans get 20 feet higher.
-It's good we live on the 2nd floor.

670
00:58:19,529 --> 00:58:22,885
Here it will be a wading pool
all the way to Orlando.

671
00:58:23,049 --> 00:58:29,204
The problem started with the invention
of the internal combustion engine.

672
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,566
That and air conditioning.

673
00:58:35,529 --> 00:58:41,843
They say every day another species
goes extinct. It's tragic.

674
00:58:42,009 --> 00:58:47,037
Who needs a lizard the size of a van?
If those things came back today...

675
00:58:47,209 --> 00:58:49,962
...people wouldn't be so thrilled.

676
00:58:51,569 --> 00:58:55,403
-Sam! What are we playing for?
-$10.00 a side...

677
00:58:55,569 --> 00:58:59,767
...fifty dollars for the match,
and throw away your worst hole.

678
00:58:59,929 --> 00:59:03,968
-This might be the one.
-My grandparents were peasants.

679
00:59:04,129 --> 00:59:08,327
They came from a country where
they used Jews for target practice.

680
00:59:08,489 --> 00:59:13,927
They only ever ate beets or turnips.
We brought my <i>tante</i> over here.

681
00:59:14,089 --> 00:59:16,478
She wouldn't go to the park.
She said:

682
00:59:16,649 --> 00:59:20,278
"Next time I look at grass,
it should be growing over my body."

683
00:59:20,449 --> 00:59:24,727
-I like to watch that Jungle Channel.
-Animals eating animals.

684
00:59:24,889 --> 00:59:28,404
-It's educational.
-For a wolverine, possibly.

685
00:59:28,569 --> 00:59:34,007
"How to hibernate in three easy lessons."
For human beings, what good is that?

686
00:59:34,169 --> 00:59:37,161
When was the last time
you stalked a creature?

687
00:59:37,329 --> 00:59:42,084
-I go duck-hunting with my son.
-I forgot. You people shoot birds.

688
00:59:42,249 --> 00:59:44,240
Shooting is not the point.

689
00:59:44,409 --> 00:59:48,960
You're out there when the sun comes up,
surrounded by nature.

690
00:59:49,129 --> 00:59:51,006
Nature is overrated.

691
00:59:52,769 --> 00:59:55,567
But we'll miss it when it's gone.

692
01:00:09,049 --> 01:00:10,482
Scotty?

693
01:00:13,329 --> 01:00:15,923
-Sorry to distract you.
-No, I need it.

694
01:00:16,089 --> 01:00:19,764
Come closer.
Come on down into the trap.

695
01:00:21,169 --> 01:00:26,368
Where I'm headed, you don't play
in a vacuum. TV camera, a gallery.

696
01:00:26,529 --> 01:00:29,248
Everybody's right on top of you.

697
01:00:32,569 --> 01:00:35,083
Try to keep that distance.

698
01:00:36,529 --> 01:00:38,008
Are you okay?

699
01:00:38,169 --> 01:00:42,162
Yes. I thought we should,
like, make it official.

700
01:00:42,729 --> 01:00:44,685
What?

701
01:00:45,009 --> 01:00:46,647
Breaking up.

702
01:00:53,249 --> 01:00:56,241
You're going off on your tour and all.

703
01:00:58,409 --> 01:01:00,718
Yeah.

704
01:01:03,449 --> 01:01:07,328
Win one tournament, you make more
than a year working here.

705
01:01:07,489 --> 01:01:10,640
-It's not the money.
-It's not?

706
01:01:14,889 --> 01:01:20,088
It's this thing that I do. Better than
almost anybody else on earth.

707
01:01:20,249 --> 01:01:24,367
If I don't take another whack
at the highest level....

708
01:01:24,529 --> 01:01:27,327
It's the purest thing that--

709
01:01:29,969 --> 01:01:33,962
Pretty stupid, huh? Talking
about golf like it's important.

710
01:01:34,169 --> 01:01:38,481
It isn't stupid at all,
you really love it.

711
01:01:43,849 --> 01:01:46,317
You just don't love me.

712
01:01:54,609 --> 01:01:57,043
Buster's Place.

713
01:01:58,369 --> 01:02:03,159
-How long's it been like this?
-All messed up? Couple of years.

714
01:02:03,369 --> 01:02:06,281
-There was a fire.
-Nobody's fixed it up?

715
01:02:06,689 --> 01:02:10,045
The people it belonged to
didn't come back.

716
01:02:12,609 --> 01:02:16,238
-So you have, like, a crew?
-On a boat?

717
01:02:16,409 --> 01:02:20,084
-Guys you hang with.
-No.

718
01:02:20,249 --> 01:02:24,561
So what are you into?
Interested in.

719
01:02:25,769 --> 01:02:27,327
Stuff.

720
01:02:31,209 --> 01:02:35,805
Like sports? Music?

721
01:02:38,209 --> 01:02:39,847
I guess.

722
01:02:45,249 --> 01:02:47,365
You think we got enough?

723
01:02:48,649 --> 01:02:51,117
Never built a coffin before.

724
01:02:51,289 --> 01:02:55,885
It used to be five yards
in a cloud of dust.

725
01:02:56,049 --> 01:02:59,359
No mouth guards,
no face guards.

726
01:02:59,529 --> 01:03:02,999
The helmet was a leather strap
to hold the brain in...

727
01:03:03,169 --> 01:03:08,118
...in case you got cracked
on the skull. What is it now?

728
01:03:08,289 --> 01:03:12,601
Technology? Hormones?

729
01:03:12,769 --> 01:03:16,762
Bunch of coloured boys flipping
a ball around the field.

730
01:03:16,929 --> 01:03:21,639
Women in the locker room?
That ain't gridiron.

731
01:03:21,809 --> 01:03:25,279
-What are they doing?
-Did you say something?

732
01:03:25,449 --> 01:03:30,159
-What are women doing in the locker room?
-Talking to the players.

733
01:03:30,329 --> 01:03:33,401
They must find it very distracting.

734
01:03:33,569 --> 01:03:37,403
They're too worried about
their stock portfolios to notice.

735
01:03:37,569 --> 01:03:41,198
It's a wonder they know what
a handoff is.

736
01:03:41,369 --> 01:03:44,247
-How do you know they're coloured?
-Who?

737
01:03:44,489 --> 01:03:47,686
The boys flipping the ball.
You can't see the TV.

738
01:03:47,849 --> 01:03:51,603
When do you hear of a white boy
called Deshon?

739
01:03:53,809 --> 01:03:56,926
Carlotta will be here for dinner.
I have rehearsal...

740
01:03:57,129 --> 01:04:00,166
...and then an Audubon meeting.

741
01:04:00,329 --> 01:04:02,889
You and your birds.

742
01:04:03,049 --> 01:04:07,725
They start clearing the Plantation
Estates expansion next week...

743
01:04:07,889 --> 01:04:10,767
-...at the old Exley property.
-Lincoln Beach?

744
01:04:10,929 --> 01:04:12,726
Not anymore.

745
01:04:12,889 --> 01:04:16,677
There's a bird colony
we're concerned about.

746
01:04:16,849 --> 01:04:20,319
The coloured folks think
there's a curse on that land.

747
01:04:20,489 --> 01:04:23,367
I'm sure it has seen
its share of misery.

748
01:04:24,529 --> 01:04:25,848
Hey, Mama.

749
01:04:26,609 --> 01:04:28,565
Hey, Daddy.

750
01:04:28,729 --> 01:04:31,721
-Trouble at the motel?
-Everything's fine.

751
01:04:31,889 --> 01:04:36,167
-Then why aren't you there?
-We got a day manager. Rosellen.

752
01:04:36,329 --> 01:04:41,483
-Those people steal you blind.
-She's got it under control.

753
01:04:46,489 --> 01:04:48,366
Are these new ones?

754
01:04:48,609 --> 01:04:51,169
I can't remember
when you were here last.

755
01:04:51,329 --> 01:04:55,208
-They all look alike to me.
-The place full up?

756
01:04:55,369 --> 01:04:58,600
-Yes. Celebration.
-How about the restaurant?

757
01:04:58,809 --> 01:05:00,037
Keeping us hopping.

758
01:05:00,209 --> 01:05:02,962
-Gotta make it while it's there.
-I know.

759
01:05:03,129 --> 01:05:07,441
-Steven was calling for you.
-He knows I don't live here.

760
01:05:07,929 --> 01:05:12,844
-It was nice talking to him.
-He's got a screw loose. Deep-sea diving.

761
01:05:13,049 --> 01:05:16,325
-That was his father.
-Puts pressure on the brain.

762
01:05:16,489 --> 01:05:20,084
Steve's put pressure on his brain,
but not by diving.

763
01:05:20,249 --> 01:05:24,208
He said he's turning over
a new leaf. I certainly hope so.

764
01:05:24,369 --> 01:05:28,487
-He had such promise.
-When did Steve ever have promise?

765
01:05:28,689 --> 01:05:32,045
When he had his group
and you were with the circus.

766
01:05:32,249 --> 01:05:34,922
It wasn't a circus.
We stayed in one place.

767
01:05:35,129 --> 01:05:38,565
When you were performing
in the aquarium.

768
01:05:38,729 --> 01:05:44,247
-You both were so hopeful.
-Well, we grew up.

769
01:05:44,409 --> 01:05:50,166
Daddy? There was a fella from
a development company over yesterday.

770
01:05:50,369 --> 01:05:52,963
You give him the boot?

771
01:05:53,129 --> 01:05:58,522
I was thinking this might be
a good time, if you ever wanted to sell.

772
01:05:59,529 --> 01:06:02,965
And watch them turn the beach
into a strip mall?

773
01:06:03,169 --> 01:06:08,243
-It's not exactly pristine at the moment.
-You help keep the place running?

774
01:06:08,409 --> 01:06:11,367
-I have not.
-Then hold your peace.

775
01:06:11,529 --> 01:06:16,205
-She's worried about those birds.
-It's a severely compromised habitat.

776
01:06:16,369 --> 01:06:20,681
-The sandhill cranes have forsaken us.
-Good.

777
01:06:20,849 --> 01:06:24,603
If they don't know better than to fly
someplace accommodating...

778
01:06:24,769 --> 01:06:27,158
...then they deserve what they get.

779
01:06:27,329 --> 01:06:32,722
Now your sea gull, that's like people.
They'll fight over every scrap they get.

780
01:06:32,889 --> 01:06:38,282
-Your father is a strict Darwinian.
-She throws her education against me.

781
01:06:38,449 --> 01:06:42,237
Anyway, this developer....

782
01:06:44,289 --> 01:06:48,840
-I told him you weren't interested.
-You can bet on that one.

783
01:07:16,129 --> 01:07:20,486
Get in there! Come on!
Get in there!

784
01:07:35,969 --> 01:07:39,439
They give you specs for this thing?
Like dimensions?

785
01:07:40,249 --> 01:07:44,640
-There's a picture in the book.
-If she's gonna get into it....

786
01:07:49,329 --> 01:07:52,605
This doesn't give us
the measurements.

787
01:07:55,209 --> 01:07:59,327
-You're taller than her.
-Right.

788
01:08:12,489 --> 01:08:16,038
Better cut some holes
so she can breathe.

789
01:08:29,689 --> 01:08:34,240
-Halt! Who goes there?
-Don't shoot. It's your ex-wife.

790
01:08:34,409 --> 01:08:39,927
-I'm on guard duty.
-Maple said you needed to see me.

791
01:08:40,089 --> 01:08:44,401
-Pretend you're just a tourist.
-Steve, come on.

792
01:08:44,569 --> 01:08:49,689
I'm serious. We got an inspector
coming by to review the unit.

793
01:09:03,089 --> 01:09:07,241
-Nice uniform.
-I hate playing a Yankee.

794
01:09:07,409 --> 01:09:12,722
-You're Greek, for chrissake.
-I was born down here.

795
01:09:12,889 --> 01:09:16,802
-So, what's the latest crisis?
-No crisis.

796
01:09:16,969 --> 01:09:22,202
Just wondering how you were
making out. Seriously.

797
01:09:22,369 --> 01:09:26,442
I found inner peace.
What's the angle?

798
01:09:26,609 --> 01:09:29,999
I heard about something.
I'd like to cut you in.

799
01:09:30,169 --> 01:09:33,525
-Not interested.
-It's once in a lifetime.

800
01:09:33,689 --> 01:09:37,125
-So was our marriage. Once was enough.
-Hear me out.

801
01:09:37,289 --> 01:09:41,919
If you don't want to be a co-investor,
we can work out a reasonable rate....

802
01:09:42,089 --> 01:09:48,085
-You want to borrow money from me?
-I could get in on something big.

803
01:09:48,249 --> 01:09:51,958
Tell me, what do we not have
on this island?

804
01:09:52,649 --> 01:09:56,164
Let's see. An opera house.

805
01:09:56,329 --> 01:09:59,401
A ski resort. A good Thai restaurant.

806
01:09:59,569 --> 01:10:05,644
-Are you familiar with water slides?
-Them plastic chute things?

807
01:10:05,809 --> 01:10:08,448
You slide down it
in your bathing suit?

808
01:10:08,609 --> 01:10:12,682
-We don't have one.
-I knew I was culturally disadvantaged.

809
01:10:12,889 --> 01:10:15,039
Know how much those things make?

810
01:10:15,209 --> 01:10:18,087
-A: You'll never get a permit.
-Don't be so sure.

811
01:10:18,249 --> 01:10:22,481
B: I don't have any money
to throw at half-assed propositions.

812
01:10:22,649 --> 01:10:26,483
-I heard you're about to come into some.
-Is that so?

813
01:10:26,649 --> 01:10:31,279
My sources inform me you've been
approached by some big developers.

814
01:10:31,449 --> 01:10:35,601
They don't know diddly.
Besides, C: even if I did have money...

815
01:10:35,769 --> 01:10:40,600
...I'd run it through the leaf shredder
before I gave a nickel of it to you.
