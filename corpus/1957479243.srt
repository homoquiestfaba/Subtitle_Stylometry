put it at the top of the ridge.

1079
00:58:10,191 --> 00:58:12,059
You put your tongue
right up against it

1080
00:58:12,092 --> 00:58:14,328
and you blow, lightly.

1081
00:58:14,361 --> 00:58:16,063
No, dude.

1082
00:58:16,096 --> 00:58:17,364
Come on, men.

1083
00:58:17,398 --> 00:58:18,899
Nice!

1084
00:58:18,933 --> 00:58:20,334
It's close.

1085
00:58:21,769 --> 00:58:26,240
[Clay whistling]

1086
00:58:26,273 --> 00:58:27,441
That's a good one.

1087
00:58:27,474 --> 00:58:29,877
- [Donny laughing]
- What?

1088
00:58:29,910 --> 00:58:31,745
No, they don't fucking
sound like that.

1089
00:58:31,779 --> 00:58:33,147
- Yeah.
- It's a bird.

1090
00:58:33,180 --> 00:58:34,982
Is that really
what they sound like?

1091
00:58:35,015 --> 00:58:37,384
[distant elk call]

1092
00:58:38,085 --> 00:58:40,321
That is what they sound like.

1093
00:58:42,556 --> 00:58:44,158
Donny, get your shit.

1094
00:58:49,463 --> 00:58:51,966
[gun cocking]

1095
00:58:51,999 --> 00:58:53,767
[indistinct]

1096
00:58:53,801 --> 00:58:56,136
- What's that sound again?
- Shut the fuck up, Donny.

1097
00:58:56,170 --> 00:58:58,138
Oh, boy.

1098
00:58:58,172 --> 00:59:01,242
- All right. He's 104 yards out,
- Uh-huh.

1099
00:59:01,275 --> 00:59:03,377
All right, poke him right
behind the shoulder.

1100
00:59:03,410 --> 00:59:05,179
This is textbook.

1101
00:59:05,212 --> 00:59:07,748
[elk bugling]

1102
00:59:09,483 --> 00:59:10,818
[gunshot]

1103
00:59:11,952 --> 00:59:14,088
- Hoo, I got her.
- Hold on, he's run out.

1104
00:59:14,121 --> 00:59:16,023
He's run out.
He's in the trees.

1105
00:59:16,056 --> 00:59:17,992
We're going to go down there
and [indistinct] blood drip.

1106
00:59:18,025 --> 00:59:19,994
Atta-boy. Come on.

1107
00:59:20,027 --> 00:59:21,161
Fucking got him.

1108
00:59:21,195 --> 00:59:23,897
[inaudible]

1109
00:59:24,565 --> 00:59:25,933
Oh...

1110
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:28,168
Yeah. I got it.

1111
00:59:28,202 --> 00:59:30,971
- Thank God.
- Yeah.

1112
00:59:31,005 --> 00:59:32,973
All right.

1113
00:59:33,007 --> 00:59:34,975
Well, let's find it. Okay. How
far could it have gone, right?

1114
00:59:35,009 --> 00:59:37,177
Just depends on where
you hit him, I mean...

1115
00:59:37,211 --> 00:59:39,013
It can go for miles, dude.

1116
00:59:41,148 --> 00:59:43,817
This isn't a lot of blood.
I'm not...

1117
00:59:43,851 --> 00:59:45,386
I'm not sure that we're going
to find this thing.

1118
00:59:45,419 --> 00:59:48,122
No, no, no, no, no.
We're gonna...

1119
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:49,390
we're gonna get my bull.

1120
00:59:49,423 --> 00:59:51,158
- Yeah.
- We're gonna get 'em,

1121
00:59:51,191 --> 00:59:53,360
or we're gonna
get me another one. Okay?

1122
00:59:53,394 --> 00:59:55,496
Well, it doesn't
really work like that.

1123
00:59:55,529 --> 00:59:57,264
But let's go break down camp...

1124
00:59:57,298 --> 00:59:59,033
Whoa, whoa,
why don't we do that thing?

1125
00:59:59,066 --> 01:00:00,534
You called it... you call.

1126
01:00:00,567 --> 01:00:02,269
Like, call it with the...
the thing.

1127
01:00:02,303 --> 01:00:03,904
Yeah, yeah, I know.
It's not gonna come in.

1128
01:00:03,937 --> 01:00:05,205
You just shot it.

1129
01:00:05,973 --> 01:00:07,341
All right.

1130
01:00:07,374 --> 01:00:08,942
It's all right.
We'll get your elk.

1131
01:00:08,976 --> 01:00:11,078
Yeah. This isn't
a grocery store, Donny.

1132
01:00:11,111 --> 01:00:12,613
Yeah,
that's why it's called hunting.

1133
01:00:12,646 --> 01:00:14,248
[Banjo laughing]

1134
01:00:16,150 --> 01:00:18,185
Good boy. Who's a good boy?

1135
01:00:18,218 --> 01:00:20,421
Who's a good boy?
Who's a good boy?

1136
01:00:20,454 --> 01:00:22,056
There it is.

1137
01:00:22,089 --> 01:00:23,957
- Good boy. Good boy.
- [harmonica music]

1138
01:00:23,991 --> 01:00:26,593
Good boy. Hey, Gunner, look,

1139
01:00:26,627 --> 01:00:28,495
- I got a smile.
- [laughing]

1140
01:00:41,108 --> 01:00:42,843
You probably didn't
get my letters.

1141
01:00:45,179 --> 01:00:46,213
You know, I...

1142
01:00:47,581 --> 01:00:49,950
I know I'm not
the coolest little brother.

1143
01:00:51,251 --> 01:00:53,954
When Dad left, I thought
I had to be a good example,

1144
01:00:55,522 --> 01:00:57,458
but wasn't really good
at sports or

1145
01:00:57,491 --> 01:00:59,159
with the ladies or...

1146
01:01:00,260 --> 01:01:01,595
with anything, really.

1147
01:01:06,066 --> 01:01:07,901
When you enlisted, I...

1148
01:01:07,935 --> 01:01:09,870
I thought you just enlisted
to get away from me.

1149
01:01:11,205 --> 01:01:13,941
I didn't know you were manic
depressive back then, so...

1150
01:01:15,075 --> 01:01:17,010
Now I know you were just...

1151
01:01:17,044 --> 01:01:19,113
setting an example for me.

1152
01:01:19,146 --> 01:01:21,014
Being a man and...

1153
01:01:21,048 --> 01:01:22,649
taking responsibility.

1154
01:01:25,452 --> 01:01:28,055
That's why
I became a game warden.

1155
01:01:28,088 --> 01:01:29,456
To make you proud of me.

1156
01:01:29,490 --> 01:01:31,425
[chuckling]

1157
01:01:33,026 --> 01:01:34,094
I'm glad you came.

1158
01:01:36,330 --> 01:01:38,332
I think I see
some people over there.

1159
01:01:46,006 --> 01:01:47,274
Oh.

1160
01:01:48,275 --> 01:01:50,677
It's Clay Wilson and Banjo.

1161
01:01:52,179 --> 01:01:54,148
Remember Clay Wilson
from high school?

1162
01:01:54,181 --> 01:01:55,949
Wanna come say hi?

1163
01:01:57,184 --> 01:01:59,253
Come on. Let's go.

1164
01:02:01,021 --> 01:02:02,990
All right. Hold these.

1165
01:02:18,405 --> 01:02:19,940
[Banjo sighing]

1166
01:02:22,376 --> 01:02:23,644
Donny, you're walking.

1167
01:02:23,677 --> 01:02:25,345
I've been walking.

1168
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:26,647
Walk some more.

1169
01:02:27,614 --> 01:02:28,682
Huh.

1170
01:02:30,785 --> 01:02:32,052
- Hey.
- What?

1171
01:02:32,085 --> 01:02:33,153
Clay?

1172
01:02:33,587 --> 01:02:35,322
Game warden. Twelve o'clock.

1173
01:02:35,622 --> 01:02:37,357
Fuck.

1174
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:39,092
Donny, hide the gun.

1175
01:02:39,126 --> 01:02:40,728
Let me do the talking.
All right?

1176
01:02:40,762 --> 01:02:42,463
I know this guy from
high school, he's a pushover.

1177
01:02:46,099 --> 01:02:47,568
Shit.

1178
01:02:47,601 --> 01:02:48,770
Fuck.

1179
01:02:48,803 --> 01:02:50,270
[inaudible]

1180
01:02:51,071 --> 01:02:52,339
Howdy-ho.

1181
01:02:52,372 --> 01:02:54,274
Hey, Galen.

1182
01:02:56,143 --> 01:02:57,712
Saw a couple handsome men
packing up,

1183
01:02:57,745 --> 01:02:59,546
and I was like,
hey, is that Clay Wilson

1184
01:02:59,580 --> 01:03:02,015
from Three Spear,
I should say what's up.

1185
01:03:02,049 --> 01:03:03,785
What are you doing
all the way out here?

1186
01:03:03,818 --> 01:03:05,419
You mean my office?

1187
01:03:05,452 --> 01:03:06,754
[laughing]

1188
01:03:07,621 --> 01:03:09,122
- How's Enny?
- Peachy.

1189
01:03:09,156 --> 01:03:10,792
We actually gotta
get back to her

1190
01:03:10,825 --> 01:03:13,227
Hey Banjo, long time.

1191
01:03:13,260 --> 01:03:15,028
- How are you doing?
- You know,

1192
01:03:15,062 --> 01:03:18,198
I'm, uh,
I'm feeling a little bit sick.

1193
01:03:18,232 --> 01:03:19,734
Must be some...
something that happened

1194
01:03:19,767 --> 01:03:21,201
but we should probably
get headed home

1195
01:03:21,235 --> 01:03:22,336
before it gets too dark, man.

1196
01:03:22,369 --> 01:03:24,338
I got a Tums
in my camp if you want.

1197
01:03:24,371 --> 01:03:25,439
Okay.

1198
01:03:26,273 --> 01:03:27,608
I get it.

1199
01:03:27,641 --> 01:03:29,309
What are you guys
doing out this deep?

1200
01:03:29,343 --> 01:03:30,778
Just doing an old pack trip
with the buddies.

1201
01:03:30,812 --> 01:03:32,679
We better get going, though.
Like Banjo said,

1202
01:03:32,714 --> 01:03:34,548
he's not feeling too hot.

1203
01:03:34,581 --> 01:03:36,216
Gotta watch that spring water
in Blitsburg Meadows.

1204
01:03:36,250 --> 01:03:37,819
- Yeah. Believe me.
- I always use tablets,

1205
01:03:37,852 --> 01:03:40,053
always, even tap sometimes.

1206
01:03:40,087 --> 01:03:42,389
Ah, well if I had only been
as smart as you, Galen, right?

1207
01:03:42,422 --> 01:03:43,590
[Galen laughing]

1208
01:03:43,624 --> 01:03:45,058
You have a good one. All right?

1209
01:03:45,092 --> 01:03:47,427
- See you.
- Holy smokes.

1210
01:03:47,461 --> 01:03:49,096
Wait a minute.

1211
01:03:49,129 --> 01:03:50,330
Donny DeLuca?

1212
01:03:50,364 --> 01:03:51,632
Are you kidding me?

1213
01:03:51,665 --> 01:03:53,567
- Clay, you know him?
- Oh, yeah.

1214
01:03:53,600 --> 01:03:55,737
- Hey, nice to meet you.
- Galen.

1215
01:03:55,770 --> 01:03:57,504
I'm literally one of
your biggest fans.

1216
01:03:57,538 --> 01:03:59,239
Me and my mom
have seen all your films.

1217
01:03:59,273 --> 01:04:01,441
From <i>Team Dracula</i>
to <i>Vegan Vampire.</i>

1218
01:04:01,475 --> 01:04:04,378
That was a good one.
Oh, man, I just love vampires.

1219
01:04:04,411 --> 01:04:05,847
Mom always said it was so weird

1220
01:04:05,880 --> 01:04:07,614
because they're horny
all the time,

1221
01:04:07,648 --> 01:04:09,416
but they have no blood flow
to their privates.

1222
01:04:09,449 --> 01:04:10,818
All right.

1223
01:04:10,852 --> 01:04:12,286
Thank you, Galen.
We're gotta get going.

1224
01:04:12,319 --> 01:04:13,855
- All right.
- See you Galen.

1225
01:04:13,888 --> 01:04:15,489
Can I just get
a quick picture with you?

1226
01:04:15,522 --> 01:04:16,690
Of course. Yes.

1227
01:04:16,724 --> 01:04:18,358
Now, watch out for Petrulia.

1228
01:04:18,392 --> 01:04:19,660
[Galen laughing]

1229
01:04:21,128 --> 01:04:24,364
Okay, let's get one like
you're biting my neck. Okay?

1230
01:04:24,398 --> 01:04:25,599
Okay.

1231
01:04:26,801 --> 01:04:29,603
[men screaming half-heartedly]

1232
01:04:29,636 --> 01:04:31,839
All right, Galen.

1233
01:04:31,873 --> 01:04:33,708
Nice to meet you.
Give your mom a kiss for me.

1234
01:04:33,741 --> 01:04:35,777
- I will do more than that.
- [laughing]

1235
01:04:35,810 --> 01:04:37,745
I can now die a happy man.

1236
01:04:37,779 --> 01:04:39,580
Just hopefully not too soon.

1237
01:04:39,613 --> 01:04:42,249
I tell you what, if you
ever need anybody, I mean,

1238
01:04:42,282 --> 01:04:44,618
anything at all, like extras,
I'll fly out for free.

1239
01:04:44,651 --> 01:04:46,754
You got it. If we need a forest
cop, I'll let you know.

1240
01:04:46,788 --> 01:04:48,622
- Okay.
- Okay, Galen.

1241
01:04:48,655 --> 01:04:50,290
<i>Adiós.</i> See you.

1242
01:04:50,324 --> 01:04:52,259
Watch out... watch out, Galen.

1243
01:04:52,292 --> 01:04:54,227
- Okay.
- Hand me that mule.

1244
01:04:54,261 --> 01:04:55,495
Let's get out of here.

1245
01:04:58,332 --> 01:04:59,566
Whoa, whoa.

1246
01:05:01,168 --> 01:05:02,369
- You got everything?
- Yeah. Yeah, go. Go.

1247
01:05:02,402 --> 01:05:03,738
- Go.
- Hey, Donny. Why don't

1248
01:05:03,771 --> 01:05:05,639
you bite my neck?
Maybe just kiss it.

1249
01:05:07,240 --> 01:05:08,609
Shit.

1250
01:05:09,844 --> 01:05:11,345
