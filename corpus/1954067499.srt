1
00:00:05,635 --> 00:00:10,336
Captain's report.
February 4, 2531.

2
00:00:10,371 --> 00:00:14,595
Five years.
Five long years.

3
00:00:14,703 --> 00:00:18,303
That's how long it took
us to get Harvest back.

4
00:00:18,604 --> 00:00:20,204
Go!go!go!

5
00:00:22,206 --> 00:00:25,085
Move on!

6
00:00:25,320 --> 00:00:26,707
I am hit!

7
00:00:31,508 --> 00:00:34,508
Keep firing!

8
00:00:36,709 --> 00:00:39,509
Go, come on.

9
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,910
At first it was going well...

10
00:00:45,311 --> 00:00:49,011
..then setback after setback...

11
00:00:53,812 --> 00:00:56,312
..loss after loss.

12
00:00:59,913 --> 00:01:04,975
Made, what was going to be
a quick and decisive win...

13
00:01:05,914 --> 00:01:09,514
..five years of hell.

14
00:01:13,715 --> 00:01:17,115
Of course that's all Harvest is, today.

15
00:01:17,416 --> 00:01:20,016
It's hell down there.

16
00:01:21,153 --> 00:01:23,212
But now it's ours, again.

17
00:01:35,154 --> 00:01:44,435
System Epsilon 9, Xatsa
February 4, 2531

18
00:01:45,070 --> 00:01:48,425
3:20 pm on battleship HALO

19
00:02:12,018 --> 00:02:13,718
Serina, status.

20
00:02:13,719 --> 00:02:17,070
Standard orbit achieved,
all systems normal.

21
00:02:17,105 --> 00:02:19,620
Prep  for Podlaunchers,
bring weapon systems online.

22
00:02:19,821 --> 00:02:21,821
Expecting trouble, Captain?

23
00:02:22,192 --> 00:02:23,622
Harvest maybe ours again...

24
00:02:23,623 --> 00:02:27,323
..but I don't think the Covenant
appreciate that, yet.

25
00:02:30,284 --> 00:02:31,924
Sgt. Forge, report.

26
00:02:31,925 --> 00:02:34,225
Definitely plenty of bad
guys down here, Captain...

27
00:02:34,426 --> 00:02:36,126
..and they found something in the ice.

28
00:02:36,127 --> 00:02:38,827
Damn it. That complicates our mission.

29
00:02:38,928 --> 00:02:40,728
- Anders, what have you got?
- Captain ...

30
00:02:40,729 --> 00:02:43,055
Scans of the northern
polar region shows some...

31
00:02:43,090 --> 00:02:45,719
..interesting Covenant
activity on the surface.

32
00:02:45,754 --> 00:02:48,161
There is some kind of
structure down there.

33
00:02:48,582 --> 00:02:51,070
What do you think they're looking for?

34
00:02:51,190 --> 00:02:53,033
That's what we are here to find out.

35
00:02:53,155 --> 00:02:55,434
We're to bring Alfa base
up to operational status...

36
00:02:55,535 --> 00:02:57,565
..and take control over that site.

37
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,265
I get my equipment, Captain.

38
00:02:59,365 --> 00:03:03,724
Lady, there is no way you're coming
down here on the first bird.

39
00:03:06,185 --> 00:03:09,638
Sgt. Forge, pull back to Alpha
Base, I'm sending you some backup.

40
00:03:09,639 --> 00:03:14,627
- Roger that. Forge out.
- So, nothing too difficult, then?

41
00:03:16,892 --> 00:03:20,536
It might be the key to
this whole war, Serina.

42
00:03:20,571 --> 00:03:23,390
It's worth the risk.

43
00:03:38,443 --> 00:03:41,843
Let's just take one last look, Sam.

44
00:03:49,110 --> 00:03:52,127
The Hierarchs are impatient.
We can delay no longer.

45
00:03:52,145 --> 00:03:54,145
What if the infection defiles the relic?

46
00:03:54,346 --> 00:03:58,801
I care not for your little
life. Open the relic.

47
00:04:07,247 --> 00:04:09,247
Well, well...

48
00:04:09,848 --> 00:04:12,348
..open sesame.

49
00:04:37,049 --> 00:04:41,305
What made you choose my observation
deck as your lab, Professor?

50
00:04:41,351 --> 00:04:45,445
I like the view. It adds..
perspective to my work.

51
00:04:47,552 --> 00:04:50,552
Forge doesn't think it's safe
for you to go down there, yet.

52
00:04:50,553 --> 00:04:51,853
He is quite insistent.

53
00:04:51,854 --> 00:04:54,654
I can be quite insistent, too, captain.

54
00:04:54,655 --> 00:04:56,955
I can take care of myself.

55
00:04:57,656 --> 00:05:00,755
Any idea, what it  is
we've got down there?

56
00:05:00,790 --> 00:05:02,426
It's all theories, right now...

57
00:05:02,461 --> 00:05:05,158
..and I'll know a lot more
once I get down there.

58
00:05:05,607 --> 00:05:06,859
I am approving the mission,...

59
00:05:06,960 --> 00:05:09,660
..but the slightest sign of
danger, and I'm pulling you out.

60
00:05:09,661 --> 00:05:13,461
- Is that understood?
- Understood, Captain.

61
00:05:16,462 --> 00:05:20,062
Hierarch, the humans are closing.
They soon will be upon us.

62
00:05:20,063 --> 00:05:24,803
No matter, the information you've
gathered here, is most  dramatizing.

63
00:05:24,932 --> 00:05:28,064
However, we must protect
what we've learned here.

64
00:05:28,065 --> 00:05:31,065
Set the charges and destroy this place.

65
00:05:31,066 --> 00:05:33,566
Destroy this holy relic?
Surely, you just...

66
00:05:33,567 --> 00:05:35,867
The journey requires sacrifice!

67
00:05:36,168 --> 00:05:39,478
Set the charges. return to us.

68
00:05:39,513 --> 00:05:41,969
Our patience is not infinite!

69
00:05:42,470 --> 00:05:45,070
It will be done.

70
00:05:59,871 --> 00:06:03,589
Spiro 5, this is Blue 6
We join with Blue 5.

71
00:06:03,624 --> 00:06:06,272
We are on route to the recon
patrol's last known position.

72
00:06:06,373 --> 00:06:08,473
Six, out.

73
00:06:11,674 --> 00:06:15,774
Blue 6, Blue 6,
We are under attack!

74
00:07:00,176 --> 00:07:04,332
This is farm group Omega,
if they want war...

75
00:07:04,677 --> 00:07:07,177
.. we'll give them war!

76
00:07:11,153 --> 00:07:14,278
Sgt., is this is what the aliens were after?

77
00:07:14,279 --> 00:07:15,579
 Seems so, mom.

78
00:07:15,580 --> 00:07:17,728
They sure paid a price,
trying to defend it.

79
00:07:17,918 --> 00:07:19,981
All quite, now.

80
00:07:28,082 --> 00:07:29,782
Hey, what are you doing?

81
00:07:29,783 --> 00:07:33,083
Nothing ventured, nothing gained.

82
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:51,084
Now, that's not what I expected.

83
00:07:58,452 --> 00:08:02,285
Heresy, remove this filth!

84
00:08:03,886 --> 00:08:06,286
- Take cover.
- Go ahead.

85
00:08:10,058 --> 00:08:13,587
These guys, just don't
know when to quit.

86
00:08:16,888 --> 00:08:20,688
One down.

87
00:08:21,889 --> 00:08:25,495
- No!
- Spirit Forge...

88
00:08:25,530 --> 00:08:28,090
..we're gonna need a loose backup.

89
00:08:33,791 --> 00:08:36,591
So, all it did, was point here.

90
00:08:36,592 --> 00:08:39,292
In the 30 seconds I had
to examine the artifact?

91
00:08:39,293 --> 00:08:42,493
Yes, all it did, was point
at a second star system.

92
00:08:42,494 --> 00:08:45,194
Arcadia Colony, to be precise.

93
00:08:45,195 --> 00:08:47,395
Population a little under three million...

94
00:08:47,396 --> 00:08:49,196
..largely unexplored, but...

95
00:08:49,197 --> 00:08:51,797
..apparently quite a vacation resort.

96
00:08:51,798 --> 00:08:53,898
There's something there, Captain.

97
00:08:53,899 --> 00:08:56,799
I think it's important to get to
it, before the Covenant do.

98
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:59,100
Our orders are to investigate Harvest.

99
00:08:59,101 --> 00:09:01,901
We still don't know a lot, about
what's going on down there.

100
00:09:02,302 --> 00:09:04,102
I understand that, Captain.

101
00:09:04,103 --> 00:09:07,603
But everything I see here, tells me
that we need to get to Arcadia...

102
00:09:07,604 --> 00:09:09,404
..to figure this out.

103
00:09:09,605 --> 00:09:12,827
Very well, Professor. I'll
clear it with Admiral Kow.

104
00:09:12,907 --> 00:09:15,507
Serina, set course for Arcadia.

105
00:09:15,508 --> 00:09:16,973
Aye, sir.

106
00:09:17,008 --> 00:09:19,876
Crazy, mystery trip to
Arcadia, plotted in...

107
00:09:19,911 --> 00:09:22,009
..spinning up FTL drive.

108
00:09:22,771 --> 00:09:24,971
Serina, get out of my lab.

109
00:09:30,187 --> 00:09:32,987
System Procyon, Arcadia
February 9, 2531

110
00:09:34,439 --> 00:09:36,956
Serina, situation update, please.

111
00:09:36,991 --> 00:09:40,312
Two Covenant vessels came
out of slip-space near Arcadia.

112
00:09:40,313 --> 00:09:44,513
The Belfast, Pillar of Autumn, Texas
and Armstrong engaged immediately...

113
00:09:44,614 --> 00:09:47,514
..and caught one with its shields down.

114
00:09:47,815 --> 00:09:49,415
We lost the Texas and Belfast...

115
00:09:49,516 --> 00:09:52,916
The Armstrong is venting atmosphere,
and Autumn is badly damaged.

116
00:09:53,017 --> 00:09:55,717
The second vessel is
engaged in surface activity.

117
00:09:55,818 --> 00:09:57,818
What kind of surface activity?

118
00:09:57,819 --> 00:10:01,499
Unknown. Wait.
I'm getting a signal.

119
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:02,500
Audio, only.

120
00:10:03,026 --> 00:10:06,320
We're being overrun, the alien
forces are inside the city limits...

121
00:10:06,405 --> 00:10:07,924
..and approaching the Space Board.

122
00:10:07,959 --> 00:10:11,322
We are still evacuating
civilians, we need help.

123
00:10:11,623 --> 00:10:14,423
Getting visuals now, captain.

124
00:10:32,624 --> 00:10:36,324
Serina, launch Pods,
bring the ship to alert!

125
00:10:40,325 --> 00:10:44,525
Arbitrar, you're unusually quiet.

126
00:10:44,926 --> 00:10:47,926
What troubles occupy your thoughts?

127
00:10:47,927 --> 00:10:51,027
Hierarch, I do not wish to be impudent...

128
00:10:51,128 --> 00:10:53,928
..but you have charged me,
with the destruction of humanity.

129
00:10:53,929 --> 00:10:58,029
A most noble cause for one
with such a troubled past.

130
00:10:58,130 --> 00:11:00,624
And I am thankful for my task...

131
00:11:00,659 --> 00:11:03,831
..but Sir, you have me
stalking ancient ruins...

132
00:11:03,932 --> 00:11:05,832
..and search empty temples.

133
00:11:05,833 --> 00:11:08,733
How does this help me
accomplish my goal?

134
00:11:08,734 --> 00:11:10,934
The war with the humans will require...

135
00:11:11,035 --> 00:11:14,935
..a great deal more machines,
that we can currently master.

136
00:11:14,936 --> 00:11:18,536
- I will take what we have!
- And leave us defenseless?

137
00:11:18,537 --> 00:11:22,837
No, the Ancients will provide for us.

138
00:11:22,938 --> 00:11:28,340
This world, shall be the birthplace for
an invasion fleet, beyond imagining.

139
00:11:28,375 --> 00:11:32,540
Enough to crush the humans
quickly, and with ease.

140
00:11:32,541 --> 00:11:35,941
But this world lies dormant.
It is just a shell.

141
00:11:35,942 --> 00:11:37,542
Blasphemy!

142
00:11:37,743 --> 00:11:42,043
The key will be found with patience.

143
00:11:42,044 --> 00:11:44,944
But perhaps there's a quicker way.

144
00:11:44,945 --> 00:11:48,041
The human female from the ice relic...

145
00:11:48,046 --> 00:11:50,646
..she has some knowledge
in this regard.

146
00:11:50,647 --> 00:11:53,847
The new planet the
relic has led us to ...

147
00:11:53,848 --> 00:11:56,148
..has also led her.

148
00:11:56,149 --> 00:12:00,249
Capture that human and bring her here!

149
00:12:00,350 --> 00:12:02,950
It will be done.

150
00:12:12,151 --> 00:12:15,751
So, it's an energy shield that they
can deploy on the planet?

151
00:12:15,752 --> 00:12:18,252
Yes, Captain. We can't see through it...

152
00:12:18,253 --> 00:12:20,153
..the Covenant are up to something.

153
00:12:20,154 --> 00:12:22,754
Agreed. We need to
find out what that is.

154
00:12:22,855 --> 00:12:25,655
Can we use the ship's cannons
and take it out directly?

155
00:12:25,856 --> 00:12:27,956
We may destroy whatever is under there.

156
00:12:27,957 --> 00:12:31,757
Covenant shield technology is
susceptible to superheated plasma.

157
00:12:32,058 --> 00:12:35,258
Aren't we field testing
some plasma based rhinos?

158
00:12:35,259 --> 00:12:38,983
Pillar of Autumn inventory shows
they have some prototypes.

159
00:12:39,018 --> 00:12:41,260
It may take some time
to get the right power cells.

160
00:12:41,561 --> 00:12:43,661
I'll need to be on the
ground to do that.

161
00:12:43,662 --> 00:12:46,662
Professor, Sgt. Forge,
let's get that shield down!

162
00:12:46,763 --> 00:12:49,963
Babysitting, again?

163
00:13:00,964 --> 00:13:04,464
How about, one for
the scrapbook, Professor?

164
00:13:04,465 --> 00:13:06,165
If you don't mind...Sgt

165
00:13:06,166 --> 00:13:09,466
I am trying to document
this area for study.

166
00:13:22,567 --> 00:13:27,038
- You will come with me.
- Why don't we put the lady down...

167
00:13:27,073 --> 00:13:30,181
..and talk about this man to freak?

168
00:13:30,344 --> 00:13:32,069
As you wish.

169
00:13:44,070 --> 00:13:46,670
- Stop!
- Anders, get out of here!

170
00:13:46,771 --> 00:13:49,471
I'll come quietly, if you let him live.

171
00:14:10,798 --> 00:14:13,472
- Sir?
- I'm OK!

172
00:14:14,210 --> 00:14:17,573
Spirit of Fire, this is
Forge. I lost Anders.

173
00:14:18,142 --> 00:14:20,834
- What happened?
- Some massive elite came out of nowhere.

174
00:14:20,876 --> 00:14:25,026
Captain, I am tracking her transponder.
It is heading away from the planet.

175
00:14:25,126 --> 00:14:27,778
Damn it. Sgt., get up
here, on the double.

176
00:14:27,879 --> 00:14:30,079
Already en route, sir.

177
00:14:33,976 --> 00:14:36,180
We are all accounted for.
Why'ven't we left, yet?

178
00:14:36,281 --> 00:14:37,681
Why aren't you in the med bay, Sgt.?

179
00:14:37,682 --> 00:14:41,484
The Professor's signal, has gone to
light speed, headed for the border.

180
00:14:41,519 --> 00:14:43,303
That puts it outside weapon's range.

181
00:14:43,338 --> 00:14:45,284
What? We have to go after her!

182
00:14:45,285 --> 00:14:48,885
Sir, I can only track that
transponder a few more seconds.

183
00:14:49,086 --> 00:14:50,386
- Captain!
- Sir...

184
00:14:50,387 --> 00:14:52,887
Anders represents a
significant security breach.

185
00:14:52,888 --> 00:14:55,988
Serina, get us under way
immediately. Follow that signal.

186
00:14:55,989 --> 00:14:58,089
Aye, aye, sir.

187
00:14:59,590 --> 00:15:04,290
So, we left a note, saying
we're leaving, right?

188
00:15:05,741 --> 00:15:09,142
February 23, 2531.

189
00:15:13,291 --> 00:15:14,891
Where the hell are we, Serina?

190
00:15:14,892 --> 00:15:17,192
We're in orbit around a
planet in the middle of...

191
00:15:17,293 --> 00:15:20,693
..actually I'm still working on that, Sir.

192
00:15:20,694 --> 00:15:22,194
Anders?

193
00:15:22,195 --> 00:15:23,895
The Covenant vessel we pursued...

194
00:15:23,896 --> 00:15:26,296
..appears to have taken
cover on the planet's surface.

195
00:15:26,297 --> 00:15:27,697
I have rough coordinates.

196
00:15:27,798 --> 00:15:31,275
- Any sign of other Covenant activity?
- Not that I can detect.

197
00:15:31,300 --> 00:15:35,200
Although this world is giving
off some pretty crazy readings.

198
00:15:37,075 --> 00:15:38,601
Get Forge down there.

199
00:15:38,802 --> 00:15:42,802
I believe he is already aboard
the Pelican, awaiting your word.

200
00:16:00,603 --> 00:16:03,803
- This is her?
- Yes, Hierarch.

201
00:16:03,804 --> 00:16:07,452
- This is the one I observed.
- Such a frail, thing.

202
00:16:07,797 --> 00:16:10,106
You would hardly think them a threat.

203
00:16:10,107 --> 00:16:12,507
I demand to know why I'm being held!

204
00:16:12,508 --> 00:16:14,308
Demand?

205
00:16:14,309 --> 00:16:18,548
Arbitrar, a human ship has arrived, and
is closing in on the entrance portal.

206
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:20,811
Get the Hierarch to High Charity ...

207
00:16:20,812 --> 00:16:24,612
..intercept that human ship
and destroy it at once!

208
00:16:33,713 --> 00:16:35,413
Nothing but ocean.

209
00:16:35,414 --> 00:16:37,514
Are you sure this is it, Serina?

210
00:16:37,515 --> 00:16:41,915
Fairly sure. Initiating deep scan.

211
00:16:42,416 --> 00:16:46,116
Docking, cleansing, that's not right.

212
00:16:46,217 --> 00:16:49,317
Captain, you're not gonna like this.

213
00:16:56,018 --> 00:16:59,518
- Serina?
- Captain, we got company.

214
00:17:12,508 --> 00:17:13,819
All hands, engage.

215
00:17:13,820 --> 00:17:17,820
Serina, I got troops down there, still.
Get them back on board, now!

216
00:17:17,821 --> 00:17:21,221
Captain, I can only hold this
position a few minutes at the most.

217
00:17:21,222 --> 00:17:22,722
Now, Serina!

218
00:17:22,723 --> 00:17:26,023
Recalling surface squads, so
that we all can die together.

219
00:17:26,024 --> 00:17:27,724
Aye, sir.

220
00:17:43,725 --> 00:17:47,725
This is all part of the plan, right guys?

221
00:18:10,826 --> 00:18:14,126
- Hard starboard!
- Hard starboard, aye.

222
00:18:25,927 --> 00:18:28,007
Captain, they are charging weapons.

223
00:18:28,042 --> 00:18:30,328
Battle stations, bring weapons online.

224
00:18:30,329 --> 00:18:32,429
Tell Forge he is not done out there, yet.

225
00:18:32,530 --> 00:18:35,730
Alerting the Sgt, aye Sir.

226
00:18:39,631 --> 00:18:45,435
Sir, am I the only one freaked out by
the fact that we are inside the planet?

227
00:19:04,533 --> 00:19:07,533
Restraints off.

228
00:19:12,534 --> 00:19:16,334
Your judgment has waited long enough.

229
00:19:21,535 --> 00:19:24,035
Just, get it over with!

230
00:19:47,323 --> 00:19:51,336
The ancients have given us
the power to doom your race.

231
00:19:51,337 --> 00:19:54,337
Let the deconstruction
of our gifts begin.

232
00:19:54,338 --> 00:19:58,438
The majesty of our new
fleet will be unparalleled.

233
00:20:13,139 --> 00:20:15,539
Nothing ventured...

234
00:20:15,740 --> 00:20:17,740
Surface.

235
00:20:24,366 --> 00:20:26,641
That worked out pretty well.

236
00:20:31,742 --> 00:20:34,842
Or maybe not.

237
00:20:37,843 --> 00:20:43,143
Lady, I haven't got all day.
You want to be rescued, or not?

238
00:20:47,344 --> 00:20:49,944
Is this really going to work, Professor?

239
00:20:49,945 --> 00:20:51,945
I believe this is our best hope.

240
00:20:51,946 --> 00:20:55,746
The overloaded FTL reactor will
cause a chain reaction in the sun.

241
00:20:55,747 --> 00:20:58,547
Enough to destroy all the ships
here, before the Covenant...

242
00:20:58,548 --> 00:21:01,148
..can get a chance to
make anything from them.

243
00:21:01,149 --> 00:21:03,772
Well, put simply, Captain ...

244
00:21:03,807 --> 00:21:06,450
..our reactor will cause
the sun to go supernova...

245
00:21:06,451 --> 00:21:08,651
..leaving nothing here but dust.

246
00:21:08,652 --> 00:21:12,041
That's the weak part of
this plan, if you ask me.

247
00:21:12,076 --> 00:21:14,209
We have no way home
without that reactor.

248
00:21:14,244 --> 00:21:16,154
One problem at a time, Serina.

249
00:21:16,155 --> 00:21:19,766
If the Covenant get their
hands on these ships ...

250
00:21:19,801 --> 00:21:23,193
..it will mean the end of the war.

251
00:21:23,228 --> 00:21:25,257
We'll take our chances here.

252
00:21:25,258 --> 00:21:27,158
Give humanity some hope.

253
00:21:27,159 --> 00:21:29,659
I know it's been a tough call, Captain.

254
00:21:30,377 --> 00:21:31,360
But it's the right one.

255
00:21:31,561 --> 00:21:34,294
Spirit of Fire, this is Forge.

256
00:21:34,329 --> 00:21:36,762
She is buttoned up and ready to go.

257
00:21:38,263 --> 00:21:40,763
Deliver that package safely, Sgt.

258
00:21:40,764 --> 00:21:44,094
Keep the coffee hot. We'll
be back before you know it.

259
00:21:44,129 --> 00:21:48,288
I'll be monitoring you from here, Sgt.

260
00:21:48,323 --> 00:21:52,466
Well, it'll be pretty
obvious, if he succeeds...

261
00:22:01,267 --> 00:22:04,667
Gentlemen, we're burning sunshine here.

262
00:22:16,868 --> 00:22:19,368
It's active!

263
00:22:19,369 --> 00:22:20,869
Sgt.

264
00:22:23,170 --> 00:22:24,870
Lt.?

265
00:22:25,771 --> 00:22:29,771
Take care of those elites. He's mine.

266
00:22:41,072 --> 00:22:43,972
Let's go!

267
00:23:17,073 --> 00:23:20,773
Like the rest of your race,
weak and undisciplined.

268
00:23:35,574 --> 00:23:39,574
There will be no female,
to save you, this time.

269
00:23:40,975 --> 00:23:43,275
Look me in the eye and say that.

270
00:23:43,866 --> 00:23:46,176
As you wish.

271
00:23:49,557 --> 00:23:54,177
My face will be the last thing your
pathetic eyes ever see.

272
00:24:06,622 --> 00:24:07,882
And for the record...

273
00:24:07,917 --> 00:24:13,313
..I would have kicked your ass the first
time, if the lady hadn't stopped me.

274
00:24:18,219 --> 00:24:20,107
Sir, it's already overheating.

275
00:24:20,142 --> 00:24:23,629
I have to separate the core, and align
it manually when we need to blow.

276
00:24:23,664 --> 00:24:28,269
Son, I have a feeling before this is over,
we'll need every last spark in the fight.

277
00:24:28,280 --> 00:24:31,286
I can do this. Report back to the ship.

278
00:24:33,001 --> 00:24:36,187
Good luck Sir, it's been an honor.

279
00:24:59,388 --> 00:25:02,488
Hangar bay reports
all crews checked in.

280
00:25:02,489 --> 00:25:04,645
Let's not outstay our welcome.

281
00:25:04,680 --> 00:25:06,190
Best speed away!

282
00:25:06,191 --> 00:25:12,779
Captain, the gravity field from the sun is
expanding. We're not going anywhere.

283
00:25:13,193 --> 00:25:15,979
Let's see if we can turn
that to our advantage.

284
00:25:15,994 --> 00:25:19,382
Serina, plot a course that
takes us into the sun.

285
00:25:19,417 --> 00:25:21,150
We're going to slingshot around it.

286
00:25:21,185 --> 00:25:22,196
Threading a needle...

287
00:25:22,297 --> 00:25:24,497
..while accelerating
around an exploding star...

288
00:25:24,498 --> 00:25:26,998
..inside a planet
that is falling apart?

289
00:25:27,099 --> 00:25:28,799
Sure! Why not?

290
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:31,200
Serina, can you do it?

291
00:25:31,201 --> 00:25:33,101
It's done.

292
00:25:33,102 --> 00:25:35,802
You might want to hold on to something.

293
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,203
Closing your eyes might help, too.

294
00:26:17,976 --> 00:26:19,976
Dyx Ogna, Checkpoint 3
March 11, 2531

295
00:26:20,004 --> 00:26:23,305
Captain, I'd much rather stay
awake to monitor this area.

296
00:26:23,340 --> 00:26:27,505
Professor, there's been no sign of
the Covenant for almost 2 weeks.

297
00:26:27,506 --> 00:26:30,318
- There is nothing to do.
- But, Captain!

298
00:26:30,319 --> 00:26:31,907
But, nothing, Professor.

299
00:26:31,908 --> 00:26:34,908
You got us all out of there alive.

300
00:26:34,909 --> 00:26:36,309
Get some rest.

301
00:26:36,610 --> 00:26:41,310
Not all of us, Captain.
Not all of us.
