1
00:00:14,447 --> 00:00:17,780
# I wonder why the hell
I stay in this town #

2
00:00:17,951 --> 00:00:21,546
# Ain't much to do
when the sun goes down #

3
00:00:21,788 --> 00:00:25,519
# But think about what I'll do
when I'm with you #

4
00:00:28,995 --> 00:00:32,328
# Still don't know
why you went away #

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:35,433
# When black and white
turns into gray #

6
00:00:36,403 --> 00:00:40,533
# Life is cold but I was warm
when I kissed you #

7
00:00:42,442 --> 00:00:45,809
# When I'm with you my heart
pounds like rain #

8
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:49,548
# When I'm with you,
I'm immune to pain #

9
00:00:49,583 --> 00:00:53,018
# When I'm with you,
I feel no restraint #

10
00:00:53,586 --> 00:00:55,679
# When I'm with you #

11
00:00:56,956 --> 00:01:00,858
# And I don't know how
I'm gonna live this way #

12
00:01:01,461 --> 00:01:04,328
# Eternity burned out that day #

13
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:09,958
# And I don't know how I'm gonna
spend my life without you #

14
00:01:11,738 --> 00:01:15,469
# And the church bells are
ringing all across the world #

15
00:01:15,642 --> 00:01:18,907
# And prophesies
go unfulfilled #

16
00:01:19,112 --> 00:01:23,947
# Cause they always told me I
would spend my life with you #

17
00:01:24,517 --> 00:01:28,009
# I won't say Adieu #

18
00:01:34,561 --> 00:01:37,553
# How much more time
will I have to wait #

19
00:01:37,730 --> 00:01:40,961
# You left me
in a restless state #

20
00:01:41,568 --> 00:01:46,062
# I'll walk around like I'm in
a trance 'til I'm with you #

21
00:01:48,808 --> 00:01:51,902
# I wonder where on earth
you could have gone #

22
00:01:52,579 --> 00:01:55,946
# Feel like a siren
that somebody left on #

23
00:01:56,516 --> 00:02:01,112
# Screaming out into the night
that I miss you #

24
00:02:02,522 --> 00:02:05,889
# When I'm with you,
I feel warm inside #

25
00:02:06,092 --> 00:02:09,528
# When I'm with you,
time and space divide #

26
00:02:09,696 --> 00:02:12,995
# When I'm with you,
I am so alive #

27
00:02:13,433 --> 00:02:15,458
# When I'm with you #

28
00:02:16,836 --> 00:02:20,829
# And I don't know how
I'm gonna live this way #

29
00:02:21,007 --> 00:02:24,033
# Eternity burned out that day #

30
00:02:24,210 --> 00:02:29,580
# And I don't know how I'm gonna
spend my life without you #

31
00:02:31,718 --> 00:02:35,552
# And the church bells are
ringing all across the world #

32
00:02:35,855 --> 00:02:38,756
# And prophesies
go unfulfilled #

33
00:02:38,925 --> 00:02:43,919
# Cause they always told me
I would spend my life with you #

34
00:02:44,130 --> 00:02:47,896
# I won't say Adieu #

35
00:02:53,540 --> 00:02:56,532
# Adieu #

36
00:03:14,227 --> 00:03:15,694
Hello Ma'am!
Beautiful day isn't it?

37
00:03:15,862 --> 00:03:16,692
Go to hell.

38
00:03:21,100 --> 00:03:22,931
Hey dude!
Can you spare some change?

39
00:03:23,102 --> 00:03:24,660
No!
Love the hair though!

40
00:03:36,182 --> 00:03:37,207
Fuck!

41
00:03:37,283 --> 00:03:38,978
I can't wear the shirt I wanted.
It's too small.

42
00:03:39,152 --> 00:03:40,552
It looks like my tits
are gonna pop out.

43
00:03:40,553 --> 00:03:41,320
Sarah!

44
00:03:41,321 --> 00:03:43,086
I just don't think that would
look very good in the pictures.

45
00:03:43,189 --> 00:03:44,791
Yes but we have to leave
in fifteen minutes.

46
00:03:44,826 --> 00:03:45,587
Don't pressure me.

47
00:03:45,725 --> 00:03:47,249
I told you,
I don't want to be pressured!

48
00:03:47,794 --> 00:03:50,092
I know. I know. But do you
have to wear your hair like this?

49
00:03:50,630 --> 00:03:51,858
Like what?

50
00:03:52,298 --> 00:03:53,822
Can't you just fix it a little?

51
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:55,934
I did already!

52
00:03:56,603 --> 00:03:57,628
Hey all!

53
00:03:57,937 --> 00:03:58,961
Sarah...

54
00:03:59,539 --> 00:04:01,006
Look what I got for you.

55
00:04:01,808 --> 00:04:03,673
Pearls!
Aren't they pretty?

56
00:04:04,043 --> 00:04:06,603
I found them on the subway
but you can borrow them trom me.

57
00:04:06,779 --> 00:04:08,940
You know -
something old, something new,

58
00:04:09,182 --> 00:04:11,013
something borrowed,
something blue!

59
00:04:11,684 --> 00:04:12,946
Do you have something blue?

60
00:04:13,253 --> 00:04:14,151
No.

61
00:04:15,989 --> 00:04:18,014
Hello Mama!
- Sarah.

62
00:04:20,293 --> 00:04:21,783
You look sparkling today!

63
00:04:21,961 --> 00:04:24,088
Oh, really.
Well, thank you Kyle.

64
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:26,562
Aren't you excited about
your son getting married?

65
00:04:26,733 --> 00:04:28,132
More nervous I guess.

66
00:04:28,301 --> 00:04:29,962
I'm the best man you know.

67
00:04:30,136 --> 00:04:31,728
I know that Kyle.

68
00:04:33,139 --> 00:04:36,074
Oh, you must be so proud of him.
Look how beautiful he is!

69
00:04:36,242 --> 00:04:37,971
Kyle, can you get her
to finish please?

70
00:04:38,144 --> 00:04:40,078
Me and mama have to get
some flowers from the deli.

71
00:04:40,246 --> 00:04:41,975
Are you sure you don't want
anything in particular?

72
00:04:42,148 --> 00:04:43,308
Maybe some nice tulips?

73
00:04:44,684 --> 00:04:45,776
I guess not. Let's go.

74
00:04:46,286 --> 00:04:47,548
Get something blue!

75
00:05:04,937 --> 00:05:05,961
Sarah - come on!

76
00:05:06,973 --> 00:05:08,068
Quickly!

77
00:05:08,374 --> 00:05:09,399
Come on!

78
00:05:19,018 --> 00:05:21,043
Yes, it seems to fit alright.
Thanks Danny.

79
00:05:24,257 --> 00:05:25,781
Hey hurry up guys!
It's our turn!

80
00:05:25,958 --> 00:05:27,323
Ok, let's go.
Come on!

81
00:05:33,966 --> 00:05:35,194
Shit, I can't get it on.

82
00:05:35,368 --> 00:05:36,357
Ok wait, let me help you.

83
00:05:38,871 --> 00:05:40,862
OK, look like you are putting it on
so mommy can take a picture.

84
00:05:42,041 --> 00:05:44,009
Marcel. Sarah -

85
00:05:44,310 --> 00:05:46,369
I now pronounce you,
husband and wife.

86
00:05:46,746 --> 00:05:48,145
You may kiss or embrace.

87
00:05:51,918 --> 00:05:52,816
Right over here.

88
00:05:53,686 --> 00:05:54,711
Come on!

89
00:05:58,091 --> 00:06:00,685
I can't believe that you made us
come all the way out here!

90
00:06:01,027 --> 00:06:01,857
Stop it Danny!

91
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:03,620
I told you, I want to get
some nice pictures.

92
00:06:04,797 --> 00:06:06,025
Kyle stand right here.

93
00:06:06,199 --> 00:06:07,291
Stand beside him.

94
00:06:08,768 --> 00:06:09,757
Danny over here.

95
00:06:09,936 --> 00:06:11,096
Sarah next to me.

96
00:06:12,405 --> 00:06:13,430
Come on!

97
00:06:13,906 --> 00:06:15,066
Hold this like so.

98
00:06:16,142 --> 00:06:17,236
Ready?

99
00:06:17,410 --> 00:06:18,342
Smile!

100
00:06:19,011 --> 00:06:20,342
OK now with just Sarah please.

101
00:06:20,747 --> 00:06:21,975
Oh, come on!

102
00:06:22,248 --> 00:06:25,115
Can you please just relax and smile,
and look at the camera.

103
00:06:26,352 --> 00:06:29,253
How about a picture of the Groom
and the Best Man?

104
00:06:33,760 --> 00:06:34,727
Stole a kiss!

105
00:06:35,094 --> 00:06:36,857
What about Sarah throwing
her wedding bouquet away?

106
00:06:37,029 --> 00:06:39,293
Finally. I can't wait
to get ride of this thing!

107
00:06:39,699 --> 00:06:40,758
Alright.

108
00:06:44,771 --> 00:06:46,033
I got it. I got it.

109
00:06:47,340 --> 00:06:49,808
I wonder what this means...

110
00:06:49,976 --> 00:06:52,137
I guess I better get a divorce...
very quickly.

111
00:06:56,015 --> 00:06:59,382
Let's hope immigration
never sees those photos!

112
00:07:01,487 --> 00:07:03,318
It made my mom so excitied...

113
00:07:03,489 --> 00:07:06,424
to be able to tell all
her friends that I got married.

114
00:07:06,793 --> 00:07:08,192
She wants those pictures!

115
00:07:08,394 --> 00:07:10,328
She's too much!
- I know

116
00:07:10,496 --> 00:07:11,861
I don't want
all my friends at home

117
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:13,362
to hear that I got married
to some guy.

118
00:07:13,433 --> 00:07:14,265
That's disgusting!

119
00:07:14,267 --> 00:07:16,462
Well you did!
Cheers!

120
00:07:16,969 --> 00:07:18,869
Kyle, how come Sarah
agreed to this?

121
00:07:19,038 --> 00:07:20,300
She's getting the apartment.

122
00:07:20,473 --> 00:07:21,804
She's getting your apartment?

123
00:07:21,974 --> 00:07:24,465
She was supposed to move out,
so that Kyle could move in with me.

124
00:07:24,744 --> 00:07:25,811
But now I'm moving out.

125
00:07:25,812 --> 00:07:26,845
But where are you going to live?

126
00:07:26,846 --> 00:07:27,813
I don't know yet, mama.

127
00:07:29,449 --> 00:07:30,916
Yes but unless I get a Greencard

128
00:07:31,083 --> 00:07:32,448
I will have to move
back to Europe as well.

129
00:07:37,924 --> 00:07:39,414
There's something
I'd like to say.

130
00:07:40,493 --> 00:07:43,223
I'm the Best Man. I'm supposed
to say something, right?

131
00:07:45,498 --> 00:07:49,195
I met Marcel a year
and three months ago today.

132
00:07:49,502 --> 00:07:55,502
I'd just moved to New York,
and one night I walked into a bar...

133
00:07:55,975 --> 00:07:56,999
And there he was.

134
00:07:57,477 --> 00:08:00,037
My heart almost stopped
when I saw him.

135
00:08:00,379 --> 00:08:01,505
I just knew...

136
00:08:03,516 --> 00:08:07,418
Marcel, ever since that day -

137
00:08:08,888 --> 00:08:11,755
I have loved you more
than anyone has ever loved.

138
00:08:12,225 --> 00:08:14,216
Everyday you make me so happy.

139
00:08:18,297 --> 00:08:19,264
Marcel -

140
00:08:21,367 --> 00:08:23,426
Je t'aime pourtourjours.

141
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:27,132
Do you wanna marry me?

142
00:08:28,975 --> 00:08:31,967
Yes Kyle! Yes.

143
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:34,878
I love you too so very much!

144
00:08:35,047 --> 00:08:36,514
There's nothing I want more.

145
00:08:49,262 --> 00:08:51,526
You do realize
I thought you were a treak?

146
00:08:51,964 --> 00:08:52,828
when?

147
00:08:52,999 --> 00:08:53,931
when we met.

148
00:08:54,433 --> 00:08:56,867
Really?
I thought I was charming...

149
00:08:57,603 --> 00:08:59,969
Freakishly charming
I would say...

150
00:09:02,508 --> 00:09:05,944
I don't mean to stare at you,
but you have gorgeous eyes.

151
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,101
Thank you.

152
00:09:09,515 --> 00:09:11,881
Is that your boytriend
standing over there?

153
00:09:13,920 --> 00:09:14,818
No.

154
00:09:15,888 --> 00:09:17,412
Do you have a boyfriend?

155
00:09:18,324 --> 00:09:19,324
No.

156
00:09:19,325 --> 00:09:20,349
Do you want one?

157
00:09:21,093 --> 00:09:22,424
That depends who's asking.

158
00:09:22,595 --> 00:09:23,391
I'm Kyle.

159
00:09:23,796 --> 00:09:24,863
what?

160
00:09:24,864 --> 00:09:26,263
Kyle!
Like... Kyle.

161
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:27,457
Oh, I'm Marcel.

162
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:29,133
where are you from?

163
00:09:29,135 --> 00:09:30,201
France.

164
00:09:30,269 --> 00:09:31,133
vacation?

165
00:09:31,571 --> 00:09:33,436
School.
Acting school.

166
00:09:34,173 --> 00:09:35,299
But I'm almost finished.

167
00:09:35,374 --> 00:09:36,131
I love you.

168
00:09:36,142 --> 00:09:36,940
what?

169
00:09:36,943 --> 00:09:38,032
Nothing.

170
00:09:39,412 --> 00:09:41,141
I'm sorry.
I thought you said...

171
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:42,144
I did.

172
00:09:44,483 --> 00:09:46,314
I'm sorry.
I don't mean to sound crazy.

173
00:09:46,485 --> 00:09:47,383
Normally I wouldn't...

174
00:09:49,622 --> 00:09:52,352
But I just can't
take my eyes off you.

175
00:09:53,893 --> 00:09:55,520
That's OK, I noticed you too.

176
00:10:04,170 --> 00:10:07,606
So, um, what kind of a boyfriend
are you looking for?

177
00:10:08,074 --> 00:10:09,439
Oh, I don't know.

178
00:10:09,675 --> 00:10:12,906
No seriously, if you could have
anyone in here, who'd you pick?

179
00:10:16,082 --> 00:10:17,106
Come on, tell me.

180
00:10:18,351 --> 00:10:20,979
would it be my triend Ben?

181
00:10:22,254 --> 00:10:23,346
Probably not.

182
00:10:23,522 --> 00:10:24,614
OK, so who?

183
00:10:27,927 --> 00:10:29,087
Maybe him.

184
00:10:31,197 --> 00:10:33,461
OK, let me go see
if he's available.

185
00:10:35,368 --> 00:10:38,929
Excuse me! I was just wondering,
do you have a boyfriend?

186
00:10:39,105 --> 00:10:42,006
Cause my friend over there
thinks you're cute.

187
00:10:46,212 --> 00:10:47,236
Sorry, he was taken.

188
00:10:47,413 --> 00:10:49,381
You're gonna have
to pick someone else.

189
00:10:50,082 --> 00:10:51,106
You're crazy!

190
00:10:51,283 --> 00:10:52,079
Come on.

191
00:10:53,586 --> 00:10:54,450
Him!

192
00:10:56,956 --> 00:10:59,356
Oh sorry.
Strippers are off limits.

193
00:11:02,261 --> 00:11:03,125
Maybe you then.

194
00:11:04,263 --> 00:11:06,163
well now we're
getting somewhere...

195
00:11:09,402 --> 00:11:10,664
Hi boys!

196
00:11:10,970 --> 00:11:12,037
Hello mama!

197
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,233
I just don't understand
why you two don't move to Europe

198
00:11:14,407 --> 00:11:15,931
and just get married
to each other.

199
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:22,339
And you Marcel, you would not
have to go through all this charade.

200
00:11:22,581 --> 00:11:25,243
Merci mama.
But we want to live here.

201
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,283
I just don't understand it...

202
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:34,718
So where's your wife tonight?

203
00:11:35,094 --> 00:11:36,118
Oh, I don't know.

204
00:11:36,395 --> 00:11:38,693
She said she was going
to play some pool with Danny.

205
00:11:39,365 --> 00:11:41,629
Not ready to consummate
the marriage yet, huh?

206
00:11:42,001 --> 00:11:43,559
No, we decided that could wait.

207
00:11:44,437 --> 00:11:48,100
I told her you would be willing
to take on her marriage duties.

208
00:11:48,274 --> 00:11:50,037
At least for the wedding night.

209
00:11:50,209 --> 00:11:53,269
Sure, I'll entertain the groom
while the wife's playing pool.

210
00:11:53,446 --> 00:11:54,242
No problem at all.

211
00:12:04,490 --> 00:12:05,479
Fuck you asshole!

212
00:12:05,658 --> 00:12:07,421
who do you think you are?
I don't do that shit!

213
00:12:07,593 --> 00:12:08,355
Get back here.

214
00:12:09,161 --> 00:12:10,594
I want my money back!

215
00:12:11,063 --> 00:12:14,430
Fuck you motherfucker! You're lucky
I don't call the cops on you.

216
00:12:35,387 --> 00:12:36,217
Thank you.

217
00:12:37,823 --> 00:12:38,721
Sorry I'm late.

218
00:12:39,291 --> 00:12:40,258
Did you just get off?

219
00:12:40,693 --> 00:12:42,285
Oh, just about ten minutes ago.

220
00:12:42,461 --> 00:12:43,189
Bye Kyle!

221
00:12:43,362 --> 00:12:44,158
Bye.

222
00:12:46,599 --> 00:12:49,591
I'm sorry I was late baby, but we'll
still make the show if we hurry.

223
00:12:49,769 --> 00:12:50,531
It's not that.

224
00:12:50,736 --> 00:12:51,566
what then?

225
00:12:51,771 --> 00:12:52,738
Guess who just called?

226
00:12:53,005 --> 00:12:54,100
who?

227
00:12:54,106 --> 00:12:55,038
My sister.

228
00:12:55,207 --> 00:12:56,207
April?

229
00:12:56,208 --> 00:12:57,231
Yeah.

230
00:13:07,586 --> 00:13:08,416
well?

231
00:13:10,322 --> 00:13:12,517
She says she wants
to be friends again.

232
00:13:13,492 --> 00:13:15,722
She says she regrets
everything that happened...

233
00:13:17,663 --> 00:13:18,391
So?

234
00:13:20,199 --> 00:13:21,188
I don't know.

235
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,798
You're not ready to forgive?

236
00:13:23,269 --> 00:13:25,760
I know it's been over a year
but it's been a good year.

237
00:13:27,439 --> 00:13:29,339
And I really haven't
missed her at all.

238
00:13:30,543 --> 00:13:32,443
You tell him to go fuck himself!

239
00:13:32,878 --> 00:13:34,675
That fucking superior
son-of-a-bitch!

240
00:13:34,847 --> 00:13:37,372
This has nothing to do with Marcel.
I think you need help.

241
00:13:37,550 --> 00:13:39,848
Professional help, 'cause I
can't take care of you anymore.

242
00:13:40,219 --> 00:13:41,846
Not mentally,
and not financially.

243
00:13:42,388 --> 00:13:44,151
Believe me,
I don't want your charity!

244
00:13:44,790 --> 00:13:46,519
I can't even bring
my boyfriend over to visit

245
00:13:46,759 --> 00:13:48,852
because I never know how
and when you'll be acting up.

246
00:13:49,228 --> 00:13:51,253
well, no need to worry
about that anymore.

247
00:13:53,132 --> 00:13:56,363
And part of me feels she doesn't
deserve my friendship again.

248
00:13:57,469 --> 00:13:58,731
She is your sister.

249
00:13:59,438 --> 00:14:01,770
And part of me feels
she's my sister.

250
00:14:02,575 --> 00:14:04,543
And don't worry about
yourmoney. You'll get it back.

251
00:14:04,777 --> 00:14:05,744
Yeah, whatever.

252
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:07,572
Besides,
I don't want your hooking money.

253
00:14:07,746 --> 00:14:09,111
Fuck you.

254
00:14:09,648 --> 00:14:11,377
I told you, I don't do that.

255
00:14:11,550 --> 00:14:12,778
April, I know.

256
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,345
It's none of your
fucking business what I do.

257
00:14:17,923 --> 00:14:19,857
She said she's not
tuming tricks anymore.

258
00:14:20,226 --> 00:14:22,217
Maybe you should
give her a chance.

259
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:27,662
Family is very important, you know.
Sometimes, family is all you've got.

260
00:14:31,637 --> 00:14:33,468
Get out of
my fucking life already.

261
00:14:34,473 --> 00:14:36,202
For once and for fucking all!

262
00:14:36,642 --> 00:14:40,339
Fine. I'll be back to get the rest
of this stuff this afternoon.

263
00:14:42,615 --> 00:14:47,279
I don't need her any more.
I got my family right here.

264
00:14:48,354 --> 00:14:52,256
Yes I know baby,
but maybe she needs you.

265
00:15:01,567 --> 00:15:03,592
Hey, this is good stuff.

266
00:15:03,769 --> 00:15:04,497
Yeah.

267
00:15:14,713 --> 00:15:16,340
Real good.

268
00:15:23,956 --> 00:15:25,947
You think we should help them?

269
00:15:28,494 --> 00:15:31,190
Yeah, probably.

270
00:15:35,935 --> 00:15:37,926
I still can't believe our luck
getting this apartment.

271
00:15:38,304 --> 00:15:40,272
Isn't that crazy?
Just across the hall.

272
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:42,506
It's great your landlord
likes you so much -

273
00:15:42,675 --> 00:15:44,836
He probably could've gotten
much more for this place.

274
00:15:45,010 --> 00:15:45,977
I know.

275
00:15:46,478 --> 00:15:49,242
And this is definitely the easiest
move I have ever had.

276
00:15:49,548 --> 00:15:50,810
And the most exciting...

277
00:15:51,817 --> 00:15:54,411
Are you sure you are ready
for us living together?

278
00:15:55,387 --> 00:15:57,446
I've never been
more sure of anything.

279
00:15:59,658 --> 00:16:03,424
Their constant lovy-doviness
makes me wanna shoot myself.

280
00:16:03,696 --> 00:16:05,288
I mean I love them
and all but,

281
00:16:05,464 --> 00:16:08,228
God am I happy not to have
to look at that every day.

282
00:16:08,400 --> 00:16:10,800
I mean praise the lord
for my own apartment!

283
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,301
Only in New York.

284
00:16:12,504 --> 00:16:13,300
what?

285
00:16:13,605 --> 00:16:17,507
Only in this crazy town
would someone marry for a lease.

286
00:16:19,411 --> 00:16:22,471
You know what else is crazy?
when I told my mom,

287
00:16:22,648 --> 00:16:25,549
She said that she would have
given me money for a broker's fee.

288
00:16:26,018 --> 00:16:27,451
It wouldn't have helped though.

289
00:16:28,053 --> 00:16:28,815
why not?

290
00:16:28,988 --> 00:16:30,751
well you still don't have
a credit history.

291
00:16:30,923 --> 00:16:33,517
Oh sure I do,
it's just not very good.

292
00:16:38,964 --> 00:16:39,896
Nice!

293
00:16:40,632 --> 00:16:42,293
They are handmade trom France.

294
00:16:42,768 --> 00:16:43,564
Gorgeous.

295
00:16:44,703 --> 00:16:46,568
You know,
this place is just perfect!

296
00:16:47,006 --> 00:16:48,405
And with Sarah living
down the hall,

297
00:16:48,574 --> 00:16:50,303
she and I are practically
living together

298
00:16:50,476 --> 00:16:51,738
without having to live together.

299
00:16:52,578 --> 00:16:54,603
God knows that
was getting on my nerves.

300
00:16:55,447 --> 00:16:56,880
She's so peculiar.

301
00:16:58,484 --> 00:17:00,509
Maybe you'll find me
peculiar too...

302
00:17:00,719 --> 00:17:01,811
I always have.

303
00:17:03,789 --> 00:17:04,915
You can never leave me.

304
00:17:17,503 --> 00:17:18,401
Hi.

305
00:17:18,704 --> 00:17:19,763
Hi.

306
00:17:25,744 --> 00:17:26,506
How are you?

307
00:17:26,507 --> 00:17:27,307
Good.

308
00:17:27,379 --> 00:17:28,505
Something to drink?

309
00:17:28,680 --> 00:17:29,806
Oh, Ice-tea please.

310
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:31,076
Coming right up.

311
00:17:33,018 --> 00:17:35,350
And Marcel?
Are you still together?

312
00:17:35,521 --> 00:17:37,512
Yeah.
He says hi.

313
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:39,456
we just moved in together.

314
00:17:39,625 --> 00:17:40,717
And you got married?

315
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:44,624
well engaged.
we exchanged rings.

316
00:17:45,831 --> 00:17:47,025
Congratulations.

317
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:48,493
Thanks.

318
00:17:51,036 --> 00:17:53,027
And you?
Anyone new in your life?

319
00:17:54,907 --> 00:17:56,636
Oh, well these two!

320
00:17:57,042 --> 00:17:58,669
Yeah, I noticed
they look bigger!

321
00:17:59,678 --> 00:18:01,441
I had to get rid
of the old ones,

322
00:18:01,680 --> 00:18:04,376
I had too much
scar tissue building up.

323
00:18:04,616 --> 00:18:05,810
Oh, I'm sorry.

324
00:18:08,787 --> 00:18:11,483
You know Kyle,
it was us against the world.

325
00:18:11,657 --> 00:18:13,522
Ever since mom's suicide.

326
00:18:13,759 --> 00:18:16,751
we always knew that no matter what,
we could count on each other.

327
00:18:21,066 --> 00:18:23,034
Do you think
we could be best friends again?

328
00:18:26,472 --> 00:18:27,734
I would like that.

329
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:32,101
I'm a different person
now, Kyle.

330
00:18:34,079 --> 00:18:35,876
And I'm really sorry
about everything.

331
00:18:36,081 --> 00:18:39,141
Me too.
I'm sorry too.

332
00:18:45,524 --> 00:18:48,550
No, I understand.
I can't say that I want this though,

333
00:18:48,727 --> 00:18:51,093
especially considering all
the things you told me about her.

334
00:18:51,463 --> 00:18:54,728
Don't let her know that you know.
Sarah, try to smile OK?

335
00:18:55,667 --> 00:18:57,931
I wasn't even thinking about that,
it's more the other things.

336
00:18:58,103 --> 00:19:00,970
She's obviously
not the most responsible person.

337
00:19:01,173 --> 00:19:04,472
I'm happy you found each other
again, I just didn't expect this.

338
00:19:04,643 --> 00:19:06,167
It's only for a couple of days.

339
00:19:06,812 --> 00:19:09,838
Her rent is way overdue and she's
got to be out of that place now.

340
00:19:10,015 --> 00:19:10,777
Sure.

341
00:19:13,051 --> 00:19:14,643
She gives me
that feeling again though.

342
00:19:14,820 --> 00:19:15,718
what feeling?

343
00:19:15,954 --> 00:19:16,852
I don't know...

344
00:19:17,022 --> 00:19:18,683
Baby, she loves you.

345
00:19:18,857 --> 00:19:20,154
Now smile!

346
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:44,574
Hi all!

347
00:19:44,750 --> 00:19:46,980
Hey girl!
Did everything go OK?

348
00:19:47,152 --> 00:19:48,050
Yes.

349
00:19:48,620 --> 00:19:49,985
Kyle, can you help me
with my things?

350
00:19:50,155 --> 00:19:51,087
I dumped all the furniture,

351
00:19:51,256 --> 00:19:53,747
but Gina's downstairs in her
mother's car and it's stuffed.

352
00:19:53,826 --> 00:19:54,885
Of course.

353
00:19:54,960 --> 00:19:58,760
Oh thank you so much for everything.
I know, my life's just insane!

354
00:19:59,231 --> 00:20:00,755
Marcel, how are you?

355
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:01,990
Good.

356
00:20:02,067 --> 00:20:03,091
Hi, I'm April.

357
00:20:03,268 --> 00:20:05,498
Sarah.
Nice to meet you.

358
00:20:05,671 --> 00:20:07,901
I've heard so much about you...

359
00:20:10,976 --> 00:20:12,238
what does she mean?

360
00:20:12,611 --> 00:20:13,737
You didn't tell anyone about...?

361
00:20:13,912 --> 00:20:16,039
Of course not.
She means the other thing.

362
00:20:26,592 --> 00:20:29,060
I can't believe
all the cool stuff you got.

363
00:20:29,228 --> 00:20:31,196
when did you buy all this?

364
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:34,793
Kyle?

365
00:20:34,800 --> 00:20:35,596
Yeah?

366
00:20:37,069 --> 00:20:38,093
I missed you.

367
00:20:48,113 --> 00:20:49,876
Kyle, aren't you
coming to bed soon?

368
00:20:50,082 --> 00:20:51,743
Yeah honey, just a minute.

369
00:20:54,219 --> 00:20:57,279
Can't you stay in here and we can
talk all night like we used to?

370
00:20:58,824 --> 00:21:00,121
we'll talk tomorrow.

371
00:21:04,096 --> 00:21:05,063
Good night.

372
00:21:15,207 --> 00:21:16,196
That is nuts!

373
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:18,309
Hey baby!

374
00:21:19,711 --> 00:21:21,201
I already ate since I didn't
hear back from you.

375
00:21:21,580 --> 00:21:23,138
Oh that's OK,
April and I got pizza.

376
00:21:23,315 --> 00:21:25,112
we're going to put an ad online
for band members,

377
00:21:25,284 --> 00:21:27,650
so we can start our band again.
Isn't that exciting?

378
00:21:27,819 --> 00:21:29,946
I thought we were going
to look at that sofa tonight?

379
00:21:30,122 --> 00:21:33,990
Oh, let's do that later.
We want to get this done.

380
00:21:34,159 --> 00:21:37,253
Besides as long as April's staying
in here, what's the point, right?

381
00:21:37,629 --> 00:21:39,563
Yeah.
I'm fine sleeping on the floor.

382
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,561
Baby I got a surprise for you!

383
00:21:42,562 --> 00:21:43,634
What is it?

384
00:21:43,635 --> 00:21:44,659
Over here.

385
00:21:44,970 --> 00:21:46,062
I'll be right back.

386
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:48,831
what is it?

387
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:56,213
Oh baby...

388
00:21:56,715 --> 00:21:59,013
I remember when we took this.

389
00:21:59,351 --> 00:22:00,943
Thank you.

390
00:22:02,621 --> 00:22:04,589
we should put it up.

391
00:22:10,262 --> 00:22:11,627
Ok, ready?

392
00:22:17,769 --> 00:22:18,861
Smile.

393
00:22:25,277 --> 00:22:26,904
I love holding you.

394
00:22:28,647 --> 00:22:30,205
I love feeling your heartbeat.

395
00:22:30,682 --> 00:22:32,650
I love looking into your eyes.

396
00:22:32,984 --> 00:22:34,383
I love your body.

397
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,146
Your nose...

398
00:22:37,789 --> 00:22:38,915
Your lips...

399
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:40,885
I love you.

400
00:22:41,059 --> 00:22:44,153
I know it's too early to say
that after just six days...

401
00:22:44,363 --> 00:22:46,297
but I'm just crazy about you.

402
00:22:46,932 --> 00:22:48,957
I can't imagine life
without you now.

403
00:22:52,003 --> 00:22:55,097
Hearing you say that
just fills my heart.

404
00:22:55,907 --> 00:22:59,138
How can I describe
how happy you make me?

405
00:22:59,444 --> 00:23:01,776
I really, truly feel that...

406
00:23:01,947 --> 00:23:04,973
My God. what can I say
I've already said too much?

407
00:23:05,150 --> 00:23:06,913
You haven't said too much.

408
00:23:12,924 --> 00:23:14,221
what do you want?

409
00:23:14,393 --> 00:23:16,827
we got a letter
from immigration today -

410
00:23:16,995 --> 00:23:20,260
They moved up our interview.
It's already next Friday.

411
00:23:20,465 --> 00:23:23,025
Are you serious?
They can't just do that.

412
00:23:23,201 --> 00:23:24,691
well they can, they did.

413
00:23:24,870 --> 00:23:27,270
Shit, we haven't even
started rehearsing yet.

414
00:23:27,439 --> 00:23:28,997
we have to do it everyday.

415
00:23:29,174 --> 00:23:29,970
No!

416
00:23:31,209 --> 00:23:33,871
Sarah remember
that guitar you wanted?

417
00:23:34,946 --> 00:23:35,810
Yeah.

418
00:23:36,014 --> 00:23:38,244
It cost about two-fifty right?

419
00:23:39,251 --> 00:23:40,218
Uh-huh.

420
00:23:40,385 --> 00:23:44,981
If we pass, I'll buy it for you.
But we have to work really hard.

421
00:23:46,224 --> 00:23:49,751
Deal.
Come back in an hour.

422
00:23:52,063 --> 00:23:54,793
I don't wear makeup.

423
00:23:54,966 --> 00:23:57,230
Even if I was straight
I wouldn't wear makeup.

424
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,836
My sister for example,
is very straight

425
00:24:00,005 --> 00:24:02,030
and she doesn't wear makeup.
Ever!

426
00:24:02,207 --> 00:24:04,232
The thing is though
we want to look professional.

427
00:24:04,409 --> 00:24:06,843
we want to look like we have our
shit together so we come across...

428
00:24:07,012 --> 00:24:09,742
like responsible,
totally normal people.

429
00:24:09,915 --> 00:24:10,813
I'm a musician.

430
00:24:10,982 --> 00:24:13,109
I live in the East village!

431
00:24:13,285 --> 00:24:15,082
Do you think
it would look totally normal -

432
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,982
To have me go in there
looking like a lawyer?

433
00:24:17,155 --> 00:24:17,985
Fat chance.

434
00:24:20,459 --> 00:24:23,087
Look, if I'm going to be able
to go through with this,

435
00:24:23,261 --> 00:24:24,785
I have to go as myself.

436
00:24:24,963 --> 00:24:27,955
Fine. No makeup.
But can you at least wear a dress

437
00:24:28,166 --> 00:24:30,191
so you look a little bit
more feminine?

438
00:24:30,368 --> 00:24:31,460
I don't have any.

439
00:24:31,837 --> 00:24:33,134
I will get you one.

440
00:24:33,438 --> 00:24:36,430
Listen it can be totally hip.
Totally you.

441
00:24:36,808 --> 00:24:38,776
I don't wear dresses.

442
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:41,412
Please! I will get you
something that you like

443
00:24:41,780 --> 00:24:42,906
and then you can keep it.

444
00:24:43,081 --> 00:24:46,414
How about you buy the dress
and then after the interview...

445
00:24:46,785 --> 00:24:48,753
I return it and keep the money?

446
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,320
Fine.
But the ring has to go back too

447
00:24:51,490 --> 00:24:54,220
and I wont let you
keep the money for that.

448
00:24:54,392 --> 00:24:56,917
I just hope K-mart
will take it back.

449
00:24:57,095 --> 00:24:59,359
It does look a little bent.

450
00:25:02,167 --> 00:25:06,297
I think Sarah's right.
You should let her be herself.

451
00:25:06,805 --> 00:25:09,865
It's important that she feels
as comfortable as possible right?

452
00:25:10,041 --> 00:25:12,441
The thing is that
we don't look like a couple.

453
00:25:12,811 --> 00:25:17,111
I look like a decent citizen and she
looks like a lesbian street hustler.

454
00:25:17,382 --> 00:25:19,350
well that's the woman
you married.

455
00:25:19,518 --> 00:25:22,487
I know, but can't she be
just a little more cooperative?

456
00:25:22,854 --> 00:25:24,253
It's just for a couple of hours.

457
00:25:25,423 --> 00:25:27,357
well you are the actor.

458
00:25:27,526 --> 00:25:29,994
You've got to be more like her.

459
00:25:30,161 --> 00:25:31,924
I mean fuck respectability,

460
00:25:32,097 --> 00:25:34,793
the important thing is you
come across as a couple right?

461
00:25:36,268 --> 00:25:38,896
Hi guys!
I'm gonna take a nap.

462
00:25:39,070 --> 00:25:42,096
Can you please let Gina in when she
comes over? We're going out later.

463
00:25:42,274 --> 00:25:44,139
How's the job search going?

464
00:25:44,309 --> 00:25:46,038
I got a few leads.

465
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:50,515
Nice guys.

466
00:25:50,882 --> 00:25:52,247
But how long is she staying?

467
00:25:52,417 --> 00:25:55,386
I don't know, she's in
a lot of trouble right now.

468
00:25:55,921 --> 00:25:57,889
Sarah how and when
did you and Marcel meet?

469
00:25:58,056 --> 00:26:00,854
we met at Thanksgiving.
Two years ago.

470
00:26:01,026 --> 00:26:03,517
I know she's your sister, but she's
not even looking for a place.

471
00:26:03,895 --> 00:26:05,863
Marcel... Smile.

472
00:26:06,264 --> 00:26:08,289
Tell me about Sarah's family.

473
00:26:08,466 --> 00:26:11,128
well I've only met
your brother James.

474
00:26:18,076 --> 00:26:20,567
Sarah, what's Marcel's
mother's name?

475
00:26:21,313 --> 00:26:22,280
Fuck off!

476
00:26:22,447 --> 00:26:24,210
I just wanna play pool
and get drunk.

477
00:26:24,416 --> 00:26:27,214
Sarah the interview
is in two days.

478
00:26:28,153 --> 00:26:30,280
what's Marcel's mother's name?

479
00:26:31,456 --> 00:26:35,449
I can't think about this all
the time. It's driving me crazy!

480
00:26:35,627 --> 00:26:37,117
I'm not gonna be able to do it!

481
00:26:37,295 --> 00:26:39,160
what's Marcel's mother's name?

482
00:26:40,031 --> 00:26:40,861
Marie.

483
00:26:41,032 --> 00:26:43,865
wrong!
The correct answer is Catherine.

484
00:26:44,035 --> 00:26:45,195
Now smile.

485
00:26:45,604 --> 00:26:46,637
Hey! Hey!

486
00:26:46,638 --> 00:26:48,071
Stole a kiss.

487
00:26:48,239 --> 00:26:50,503
Yeah, I got a bigger size.
You know I'm a big girl.

488
00:26:50,675 --> 00:26:53,269
I have to keep massaging them
though. They're really hard!

489
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:57,011
She has to save
some money up first.

490
00:26:57,282 --> 00:26:59,045
For deposit and all that.

491
00:26:59,284 --> 00:27:01,309
No fucking way!
Are you kidding me?

492
00:27:01,486 --> 00:27:02,953
So why isn't she working?

493
00:27:03,121 --> 00:27:06,454
well it's tough to go back to a
regular job after making so much money

494
00:27:06,625 --> 00:27:08,923
Do you even realize
how crazy this logic is?

495
00:27:09,127 --> 00:27:11,186
She's not comfortable
prostituting anymore...

496
00:27:11,263 --> 00:27:12,122
Shhh...

497
00:27:12,197 --> 00:27:13,892
That's great.
I'm happy she stopped.

498
00:27:14,065 --> 00:27:15,327
But then she gets
kicked out of her apartment...

499
00:27:15,500 --> 00:27:17,593
Because she gets a boob job
instead of paying her rent.

500
00:27:17,969 --> 00:27:19,231
And then she just
moves in with us.

501
00:27:19,404 --> 00:27:20,371
It's temporary.

502
00:27:21,106 --> 00:27:23,165
She's been lying around here
for almost two months,

503
00:27:23,341 --> 00:27:24,603
and she hasn't even
looked for a place.

504
00:27:24,976 --> 00:27:26,341
Because she doesn't
have any money.

505
00:27:26,511 --> 00:27:27,978
Because she doesn't
wanna get a job.

506
00:27:28,146 --> 00:27:30,341
Because it's too hard for her
to work an entire day...

507
00:27:30,515 --> 00:27:32,244
and barely make what
she used to in half an hour!

508
00:27:32,417 --> 00:27:34,578
Do you want to push my sister
back into working the streets?

509
00:27:34,953 --> 00:27:36,181
I want her to move out.

510
00:27:36,354 --> 00:27:38,015
You're such an asshole.

511
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:40,180
Kyle what about us?

512
00:27:41,026 --> 00:27:43,187
I couldn't help but
overhear this conversation.

513
00:27:43,361 --> 00:27:45,352
Marcel is just a bit
stressed right now

514
00:27:45,530 --> 00:27:47,191
because of his
interview tomorrow.

515
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:48,991
well he should know that
I'm here as your guest.

516
00:27:49,167 --> 00:27:50,464
You've overstayed your welcome.

517
00:27:50,635 --> 00:27:52,296
Kyle, tell him I can stay.

518
00:27:52,470 --> 00:27:54,199
Kyle and I
make these decisions together.

519
00:27:54,372 --> 00:27:57,205
You're the one pushing him around,
making decisions for the both of you.

520
00:27:57,375 --> 00:28:00,469
Look, both Kyle and I are working
our asses off waiting tables.

521
00:28:00,645 --> 00:28:02,670
I know that you're used
to having him cover over your ass...

522
00:28:03,048 --> 00:28:05,380
but I will certainly not
be taken advantage of any longer.

523
00:28:05,550 --> 00:28:06,278
Kyle!

524
00:28:06,518 --> 00:28:08,110
How can you allow this?

525
00:28:09,020 --> 00:28:09,987
Marcel...

526
00:28:10,155 --> 00:28:11,417
This slobbering around...

527
00:28:11,589 --> 00:28:14,057
Occupying the entire
living room with your shit!

528
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,989
using our phone, eating our food,
leaving your dirty dishes...

529
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:18,221
Don't talk to her like that!

530
00:28:18,396 --> 00:28:20,227
Fine.
I'm out of here.

531
00:28:20,398 --> 00:28:23,231
But when I come back, I want to know
the date she's moving out,

532
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:25,301
and it better be within a week!

533
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,495
She doesn't have
anywhere else to go.

534
00:28:28,673 --> 00:28:31,198
I can't stand this
living situation any longer.

535
00:28:31,309 --> 00:28:32,298
How can you be so selfish?

536
00:28:32,477 --> 00:28:34,104
If I'm selfish it's for us.

537
00:28:34,279 --> 00:28:35,473
She's my sister...

538
00:28:35,647 --> 00:28:37,410
That's what scares me so...

539
00:28:37,582 --> 00:28:39,277
That blood is thicker
than water.

540
00:28:39,451 --> 00:28:40,679
that you will
choose her over me.

541
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,720
I don't wanna choose.
why should I have to choose?

542
00:28:43,088 --> 00:28:46,182
I want both my boyfriend
and my sister in my life.

543
00:28:46,357 --> 00:28:48,484
I deserve to have both.

544
00:28:52,197 --> 00:28:54,131
# Flying high like a dove #

545
00:28:54,299 --> 00:28:56,563
# You and me in the night heat #

546
00:28:56,735 --> 00:28:59,101
# All the angels above #

547
00:28:59,270 --> 00:29:03,206
# what's the color of love. #

548
00:29:03,374 --> 00:29:05,308
Shh! we can't be this loud.
It's really late.

549
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,104
we have to practice
for the concert.

550
00:29:07,212 --> 00:29:08,702
And rehearsal with Tommy
is tomorrow.

551
00:29:09,080 --> 00:29:10,638
I know. I can't believe
he got us a gig already.

552
00:29:10,815 --> 00:29:12,112
we have to work really hard.

553
00:29:12,283 --> 00:29:14,114
As long as Marcel will allow it.

554
00:29:14,285 --> 00:29:16,116
Don't say things like that.

555
00:29:16,354 --> 00:29:19,619
If you kick him out,
you and I can stay here together.

556
00:29:19,691 --> 00:29:20,419
April!

557
00:29:20,592 --> 00:29:21,320
what?

558
00:29:21,760 --> 00:29:24,194
I know he'd prefer if I
was out of your life completely.

559
00:29:24,362 --> 00:29:25,158
April, please.

560
00:29:25,330 --> 00:29:26,163
what?

561
00:29:26,164 --> 00:29:27,688
Can't you just try
and make friends with him?

562
00:29:28,066 --> 00:29:29,658
He's the one going postal on me!

563
00:29:29,834 --> 00:29:32,029
And he's so possessive of you.

564
00:29:32,270 --> 00:29:33,293
You do know that?

565
00:29:50,855 --> 00:29:51,685
I'm sorry.

566
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:53,483
I'm sorry too.

567
00:29:54,125 --> 00:29:55,786
You know when I hear
your keys in the door

568
00:29:56,161 --> 00:29:58,129
my whole heart
just bursts with love.

569
00:29:58,296 --> 00:29:59,593
My baby's home!

570
00:29:59,798 --> 00:30:02,392
It's the two most amazing
seconds of my day.

571
00:30:02,567 --> 00:30:04,296
Baby, I love you!

572
00:30:04,836 --> 00:30:07,202
Do you realize that this
was our first fight ever?

573
00:30:07,372 --> 00:30:08,236
That is just crazy.

574
00:30:08,406 --> 00:30:09,373
I know.

575
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:11,331
Let's never fight again.

576
00:30:11,509 --> 00:30:12,305
Deal.

577
00:30:13,378 --> 00:30:15,539
I guess I'm under
a lot of stress.

578
00:30:16,548 --> 00:30:18,448
I'm sorry for being
so mean to April.

579
00:30:18,616 --> 00:30:20,777
It's okay, I know she drives
a lot of people crazy,

580
00:30:21,152 --> 00:30:22,346
but she's leaving soon.

581
00:30:22,687 --> 00:30:23,654
Promise?

582
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:25,346
Promise.

583
00:30:36,234 --> 00:30:38,361
So baby, are you
ready for tomorrow?

584
00:30:38,536 --> 00:30:40,197
I think so.

585
00:30:40,371 --> 00:30:42,771
I just hope Sarah will be OK.

586
00:30:43,208 --> 00:30:44,300
She's so nervous.

587
00:30:44,542 --> 00:30:46,476
It will go wonderful.

588
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,507
You just have to wait.
Have a seat.

589
00:30:55,720 --> 00:30:58,245
Sorry, it's going to take longer.
The process is always like this...

590
00:30:58,423 --> 00:31:00,857
They might be watching us.
Try to look like you're in love.

591
00:31:01,226 --> 00:31:02,488
I'm trying!

592
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:06,727
Do you see any?

593
00:31:07,899 --> 00:31:09,127
Any what?

594
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:11,532
Cameras?

595
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:18,508
No they must have
hidden them very well.

596
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,778
I can't believe they
have us wait this long...

597
00:31:21,946 --> 00:31:23,743
we had a ten o'clock appointment.
It's already one!

598
00:31:23,915 --> 00:31:25,143
I know.

599
00:31:25,550 --> 00:31:28,417
I hate immigration.
Immigration is fucked up.

600
00:31:28,586 --> 00:31:29,484
Shhh!

601
00:31:31,222 --> 00:31:33,520
Marcel Colard!

602
00:31:33,691 --> 00:31:36,717
Okay honey it's us.
Let's do it.

603
00:31:36,895 --> 00:31:37,793
I love you.

604
00:31:37,962 --> 00:31:40,192
I love you too, sugar muffin.

605
00:31:53,912 --> 00:31:56,472
Repeat after me.
I swear to tell the truth,

606
00:31:56,648 --> 00:31:58,377
the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth.

607
00:31:58,378 --> 00:31:59,416
So help me God.

608
00:31:59,417 --> 00:32:01,578
I swear to tell the truth,
the whole truth,

609
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:04,483
and nothing but the truth.
So help me God.

610
00:32:04,822 --> 00:32:06,255
Sit down.

611
00:32:15,934 --> 00:32:17,424
when's your husbands birthday?

612
00:32:17,602 --> 00:32:19,263
June 22.

613
00:32:21,439 --> 00:32:22,633
when's your wife's birthday?

614
00:32:22,807 --> 00:32:24,502
July 5.

615
00:32:25,243 --> 00:32:26,574
we're both cancers!

616
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:34,377
where does your husband work?

617
00:32:34,919 --> 00:32:38,685
He works at the
Madison Square Cafe.

618
00:32:39,657 --> 00:32:42,251
Cafe Blanc is the name
of the corporation,

619
00:32:42,427 --> 00:32:45,624
but the restaurant is called
Madison Square Cafe.

620
00:32:46,731 --> 00:32:48,790
How much is your husband making?

621
00:32:49,968 --> 00:32:53,961
Oh, he takes home
about five hundred a week.

622
00:32:54,339 --> 00:32:55,339
Really?

623
00:32:55,340 --> 00:32:57,001
I know it says in that letter
from my boss

624
00:32:57,375 --> 00:32:58,865
that I make
seven hundred a week...

625
00:32:59,043 --> 00:33:00,601
but I work
in an outdoor restaurant,

626
00:33:00,778 --> 00:33:02,678
and with the weather
we've been having so far,

627
00:33:02,847 --> 00:33:05,008
five hundred is really all
that I've been making.

628
00:33:05,383 --> 00:33:06,873
where does your wife work?

629
00:33:07,051 --> 00:33:08,678
Marvin's records.

630
00:33:10,521 --> 00:33:12,785
why does it say here
that your single in this paper?

631
00:33:12,957 --> 00:33:15,949
I know that I filled out the paperwork
saying that I was married but...

632
00:33:16,327 --> 00:33:18,693
maybe because I asked them to
take out the higher single rate,

633
00:33:18,930 --> 00:33:20,022
they fucked it up.

634
00:33:21,599 --> 00:33:22,793
Screwed it up.

635
00:33:25,436 --> 00:33:28,371
what was your
taxable income last year?

636
00:33:28,806 --> 00:33:30,899
About 25 thousand?

637
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:32,339
Really?

638
00:33:32,510 --> 00:33:34,944
No! Honey, it was much higher
than that, maybe 35?

639
00:33:35,313 --> 00:33:37,747
I did the taxes
and I can't even remember.

640
00:33:37,915 --> 00:33:40,611
Sarah has no clue
about our finances.

641
00:33:41,386 --> 00:33:44,480
So what other proof do
you two have that you're together?

642
00:33:44,756 --> 00:33:47,953
well we have our joint apartment lease.
Joint bank account.

643
00:33:48,326 --> 00:33:49,657
we have some pictures.

644
00:33:59,737 --> 00:34:00,761
who's that?

645
00:34:00,938 --> 00:34:01,927
Oh that's our friend Danny.

646
00:34:02,106 --> 00:34:04,506
He's responsible for us getting
together in the first place.

647
00:34:04,575 --> 00:34:05,475
who's that?

648
00:34:05,476 --> 00:34:08,741
That is Sarah's friend Megan,
and that is my mother.

649
00:34:08,913 --> 00:34:10,744
what's your husband's
mother's name?

650
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:11,882
Catherine.

651
00:34:15,353 --> 00:34:17,412
why didn't your parents
make it to the wedding?

652
00:34:17,588 --> 00:34:20,580
well they couldn't get away.
They have a farm.

653
00:34:20,758 --> 00:34:23,750
But we're going to go home to
Arizona for Christmas this year.

654
00:34:23,928 --> 00:34:26,328
And Sarah is going to teach
me horseback riding.

655
00:34:26,764 --> 00:34:31,599
So you'd say that your parents
approve of the marriage?

656
00:34:31,936 --> 00:34:35,064
Oh yes, of course! My mother,
she wants for me what I want.

657
00:34:35,440 --> 00:34:36,429
She's really cool.

658
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:40,373
well I guess you wont mind
my calling her then, will ya?

659
00:34:40,545 --> 00:34:41,910
No, of course not.

660
00:34:42,080 --> 00:34:44,048
well write down the number.

661
00:35:00,431 --> 00:35:01,455
Hello!

662
00:35:03,067 --> 00:35:04,830
Its an answering machine.

663
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:08,728
Do you have another number?

664
00:35:08,906 --> 00:35:10,601
No, I don't.

665
00:35:13,444 --> 00:35:18,609
well... do you have any other
proof that you're together?

666
00:35:18,783 --> 00:35:19,943
I don't know.
Bills maybe?

667
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:22,552
well I asked the phone company
to put both our names on bill

668
00:35:22,720 --> 00:35:23,880
but they wouldn't.

669
00:35:24,055 --> 00:35:26,683
well, what about
more bank accounts?

670
00:35:27,859 --> 00:35:30,987
Look, we have one
bank account, okay?

671
00:35:31,195 --> 00:35:33,060
That's all that we need.

672
00:35:33,431 --> 00:35:35,661
we've only been married
for a little while

673
00:35:35,833 --> 00:35:37,733
and we don't
have everything joint yet!

674
00:35:37,902 --> 00:35:39,836
These things happen gradually.

675
00:35:42,740 --> 00:35:43,672
Here.

676
00:35:43,841 --> 00:35:45,172
Yeah, I think you
should have that checked out.

677
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:46,874
well I already made
an appointment with...

678
00:35:47,044 --> 00:35:49,706
we passed!
we passed! we passed!

679
00:35:50,648 --> 00:35:52,616
# What's the color of love #

680
00:35:52,783 --> 00:35:54,978
# What's the case
of my heartbeat #

681
00:35:55,153 --> 00:35:57,485
# Call the angels above #

682
00:35:57,655 --> 00:35:59,885
# What's the color of love #

683
00:36:00,057 --> 00:36:02,150
# Flying high like a dove #

684
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:04,654
# You and me in the night heat #

685
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,093
# All the angels above #

686
00:36:07,465 --> 00:36:09,899
# What's the color of love #

687
00:36:16,240 --> 00:36:19,607
# What's the color of love #

688
00:36:26,250 --> 00:36:29,083
# What's the color of love #

689
00:36:30,755 --> 00:36:33,690
Hi everybody.
we're The Inertia Kiss.

690
00:36:34,759 --> 00:36:37,887
It's great to see so many
of you out here tonight.

691
00:36:38,062 --> 00:36:41,589
This is our first live gig ever.
I'm Kyle.

692
00:36:41,799 --> 00:36:42,857
Over here is April.

693
00:36:42,858 --> 00:36:43,800
Hi!

694
00:36:43,801 --> 00:36:45,530
And this is Tommy.

695
00:36:46,070 --> 00:36:49,164
And now we're going to do
a song that's very special to me.

696
00:36:49,574 --> 00:36:53,476
I wrote it to my baby.
For our two year anniversary.

697
00:37:02,787 --> 00:37:07,224
# We had a chance
in a million to one #

698
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:12,188
# Driving the corvette
down the road on the run #

699
00:37:13,097 --> 00:37:17,625
# Oh, running in the night.
Oh, running in the night #

700
00:37:18,135 --> 00:37:21,571
# Me and my boyfriend #

701
00:37:23,074 --> 00:37:27,602
# Why should we care
for the powers that be? #

702
00:37:27,812 --> 00:37:32,112
# Always gonna do
anything to be free. #

703
00:37:33,251 --> 00:37:37,813
# Oh, running in the night.
Oh, running in the night #

704
00:37:38,589 --> 00:37:41,956
# me and my boyfriend. #

705
00:37:46,564 --> 00:37:49,761
# I could never be lonely #

706
00:37:51,269 --> 00:37:53,897
# I'm together with you #

707
00:37:54,071 --> 00:37:58,804
# Gonna run away.
Where he goes I will stay #

708
00:37:58,976 --> 00:38:02,776
# 'Cause he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend #

709
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:09,112
# Day by day
love is coming my way #

710
00:38:09,287 --> 00:38:12,620
# 'Cause he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend #

711
00:38:14,625 --> 00:38:17,560
# He's my boyfriend #

712
00:38:18,963 --> 00:38:23,059
# Maybe it's fair to say
I live like a fool #

713
00:38:23,968 --> 00:38:28,667
# What else could I do
when ever love makes the rules #

714
00:38:29,607 --> 00:38:34,203
# Oh, running in the night.
Oh, running in the night #

715
00:38:34,378 --> 00:38:37,677
# Me and my boyfriend #

716
00:38:39,817 --> 00:38:43,344
# Why should we plan
what tomorrow will bring #

717
00:38:44,655 --> 00:38:48,989
# Why believing that it
could change anything #

718
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:54,590
# Oh, running in the night.
Oh, running in the night #

719
00:38:55,032 --> 00:38:58,365
# Me and my boyfriend #

720
00:39:03,140 --> 00:39:06,667
# I could never be lonely #

721
00:39:08,045 --> 00:39:10,343
# I'm together with you. #

722
00:39:10,815 --> 00:39:15,309
# Gonna run away.
Where he goes I will stay #

723
00:39:15,686 --> 00:39:18,849
# 'Cause he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend #

724
00:39:21,292 --> 00:39:25,661
# Day by day
love is coming my way #

725
00:39:25,830 --> 00:39:29,231
# 'Cause he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend #

726
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:32,192
I really think you should let go
of your anger on that line

727
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:34,133
and start breaking down there.

728
00:39:35,439 --> 00:39:39,876
That would be a stronger choice
and you would show your range.

729
00:39:42,346 --> 00:39:45,213
Oh my God! Did you see that?
what was he wearing?

730
00:39:45,416 --> 00:39:47,907
Hey baby! Hey Jenny!
How are you?

731
00:39:47,908 --> 00:39:48,752
Hi!

732
00:39:48,753 --> 00:39:49,777
Honey what are you doing home?

733
00:39:49,954 --> 00:39:51,785
we have to write some
cover letters to music agents.

734
00:39:51,956 --> 00:39:53,082
But I'm rehearsing
for my audition.

735
00:39:53,257 --> 00:39:55,122
You weren't supposed to be back
until after four.

736
00:39:55,292 --> 00:39:58,193
we'll be in the bedroom.
we won't disturb you.

737
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:05,426
Please we need privacy.
we talked about this.

738
00:40:05,803 --> 00:40:08,033
No we didn't. You told me
not to come home until four.

739
00:40:08,205 --> 00:40:09,365
I never agreed to it.

740
00:40:09,740 --> 00:40:12,231
You can't tell me what to do.
I live here too.

741
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:16,005
Baby, I'll make it up to you.
Leave now and come back at four.

742
00:40:16,180 --> 00:40:18,341
You can't tell him what to do.
He pays rent too.

743
00:40:18,342 --> 00:40:19,082
Yeah.

744
00:40:19,083 --> 00:40:20,812
well you don't,
so stay out of this.

745
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:21,883
I moved out didn't I?

746
00:40:22,052 --> 00:40:22,886
Finally.

747
00:40:22,887 --> 00:40:24,354
Marcel, we're not leaving.

748
00:40:25,356 --> 00:40:27,950
Come on. You know
how important this is to me!

749
00:40:28,125 --> 00:40:29,319
April has an appointment later!

750
00:40:29,727 --> 00:40:31,422
And we have to get
these letters done today.

751
00:40:31,796 --> 00:40:33,093
Yeah.
This is ridiculous.

752
00:40:33,831 --> 00:40:34,923
Stay out of it!

753
00:40:35,099 --> 00:40:39,229
No you stay out of here.
And we'll stay out of there!

754
00:40:40,838 --> 00:40:45,070
# Gonna run away.
Where he goes I will stay #

755
00:40:45,843 --> 00:40:48,903
# 'Cause he's my boyfriend.
Boyfriend #

756
00:40:51,348 --> 00:40:53,077
# Day by day... #

757
00:40:53,784 --> 00:40:54,944
why do you put up
with that shit?

758
00:40:55,119 --> 00:40:56,245
He's not always like that.

759
00:41:01,158 --> 00:41:03,092
# He's my boyfriend #

760
00:41:06,163 --> 00:41:08,893
# He's my boyfriend #

761
00:41:30,387 --> 00:41:32,412
There's a lot of
scar tissue build up.

762
00:41:32,823 --> 00:41:34,484
Your body is definitely
rejecting them.

763
00:41:34,859 --> 00:41:37,054
I'm afraid you need
to have them removed.

764
00:41:40,798 --> 00:41:42,231
Goodbye April.

765
00:42:32,850 --> 00:42:34,909
I decided to go back
to being a boy.

766
00:42:35,519 --> 00:42:37,009
Really?

767
00:42:39,423 --> 00:42:42,551
If I can't have breasts,
what kind of woman am I gonna be?

768
00:42:43,594 --> 00:42:47,462
Besides, I wasn't ever sure if
I wanted to go through with it.

769
00:42:48,032 --> 00:42:50,023
Gina still regrets
having cut it off.

770
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:52,031
Have you really
thought it through?

771
00:42:52,636 --> 00:42:55,264
This isn't the first time
you've tried this.

772
00:42:56,073 --> 00:42:58,166
Are you sure you can
be happy as a boy?

773
00:43:00,044 --> 00:43:01,341
I have to.

774
00:43:03,614 --> 00:43:06,139
I'm gonna get on
male hormones instead.

775
00:43:06,317 --> 00:43:08,979
And the doctor says
I can get fake testicles.

776
00:43:09,153 --> 00:43:14,090
wow. I'm so used
to you being April now.

777
00:43:16,894 --> 00:43:18,953
It'll be for good this time.

778
00:43:19,530 --> 00:43:22,522
I'm gonna have my breasts
removed in a couple of weeks.

779
00:43:23,167 --> 00:43:25,067
And I'll be Cole again.

780
00:43:27,037 --> 00:43:32,566
Hey. I'll always love you.
No matter what you do.

781
00:43:34,311 --> 00:43:35,505
I know.

782
00:43:47,391 --> 00:43:50,326
what the fuck?
what is she doing in our bed?

783
00:43:50,494 --> 00:43:53,156
Sleeping. It got late.
Come to bed.

784
00:43:53,330 --> 00:43:54,888
I've been shooting
since seven this morning.

785
00:43:55,065 --> 00:43:55,997
I can't deal
with this right now.

786
00:43:56,166 --> 00:43:57,531
I want her out of our bed.

787
00:43:57,701 --> 00:43:59,362
That's fine.
I can sleep on the sofa.

788
00:43:59,536 --> 00:44:02,505
I thought you moved out.
Here's twenty dollars for a cab.

789
00:44:05,309 --> 00:44:07,300
Don't insult me!

790
00:44:07,578 --> 00:44:09,375
I don't need your money.

791
00:44:09,713 --> 00:44:10,680
April is staying.

792
00:44:11,048 --> 00:44:12,606
Does she have to be
in our fucking bed too?

793
00:44:12,607 --> 00:44:13,549
I mean come on!

794
00:44:13,550 --> 00:44:15,541
You're a selfish
fucking asshole!

795
00:44:15,719 --> 00:44:18,313
Kyle, I don't know what you're doing
with him and I'll never understand it.

796
00:44:18,489 --> 00:44:20,684
I"m sorry that I find it
disturbing to have prostitutes

797
00:44:21,058 --> 00:44:22,058
between my clean sheets.

798
00:44:22,059 --> 00:44:22,759
How dare you?

799
00:44:22,760 --> 00:44:24,184
Don't say shit like that
to my sister!

800
00:44:24,428 --> 00:44:26,293
You have no idea
what she's been going through!

801
00:44:26,463 --> 00:44:28,624
I didn't say it to her.
It was a general statement.

802
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:30,523
Besides you know
she's doing it again.

803
00:44:30,634 --> 00:44:33,194
why do you destroy things
between us like this?

804
00:44:33,370 --> 00:44:36,305
why do you let her destroy
things between us like this?

805
00:44:36,473 --> 00:44:38,236
Goodnight Kyle.
I'll see you tomorrow.

806
00:44:38,409 --> 00:44:39,433
April!

807
00:44:44,048 --> 00:44:45,345
I hate you.

808
00:44:47,384 --> 00:44:50,581
I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry.

809
00:44:52,556 --> 00:44:53,682
I'm sorry.

810
00:44:55,059 --> 00:44:56,526
I'm sorry, too.

811
00:44:57,428 --> 00:44:58,656
I love you.

812
00:44:59,997 --> 00:45:01,487
I love you, too.

813
00:45:12,176 --> 00:45:15,168
# I've been to Greece
I've been to Paris #

814
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,546
# I've seen Brazil and Mexico #

815
00:45:22,052 --> 00:45:25,488
# I've sensed a blooming tree
of cherries #

816
00:45:26,623 --> 00:45:29,615
# And watched ten thousand
flowers grow #

817
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:34,653
# Every day my world
is full of colors. #

818
00:45:35,032 --> 00:45:36,065
# Colors. #

819
00:45:36,066 --> 00:45:39,126
# Red or green or blue
til I met you #

820
00:45:40,804 --> 00:45:43,068
# What's the color of love #

821
00:45:43,240 --> 00:45:45,435
# What's the case
with my heartbeat #

822
00:45:45,609 --> 00:45:47,702
# Call the angels above #

823
00:45:48,078 --> 00:45:50,046
# What's the color of love #

824
00:45:50,214 --> 00:45:52,444
# Flying high like a dove #

825
00:45:52,750 --> 00:45:55,048
# You and me
and the night heat #

826
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,777
# All the angels above #

827
00:45:57,154 --> 00:45:59,384
# What's the color of love #

828
00:45:59,757 --> 00:46:01,156
# Red #

829
00:46:02,226 --> 00:46:03,454
# Orange #

830
00:46:04,695 --> 00:46:06,026
# Yellow #

831
00:46:07,231 --> 00:46:08,425
# Green #

832
00:46:09,566 --> 00:46:10,794
# Blue #

833
00:46:12,069 --> 00:46:13,229
# Purple #

834
00:46:14,404 --> 00:46:19,103
# uh oh. Uh oh.
Uh oh. Uh oh. #

835
00:46:19,276 --> 00:46:21,574
# What's the color?
What's the color #

836
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,679
# What's the color of love #

837
00:46:23,847 --> 00:46:26,111
# What's the case
of my heartbeat #

838
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,341
# Call the angels above #

839
00:46:28,519 --> 00:46:30,817
# What's the color of love #

840
00:46:32,589 --> 00:46:34,716
I just wished we hadn't
messed up that last song.

841
00:46:35,125 --> 00:46:37,218
I know!
Kyle came in really late there.

842
00:46:37,394 --> 00:46:39,328
Congratulations guys
the show is wonderful!

843
00:46:39,496 --> 00:46:40,520
I took some great pictures.

844
00:46:40,697 --> 00:46:41,425
Thank you.

845
00:46:41,598 --> 00:46:43,293
You looked great tonightApril.

846
00:46:48,739 --> 00:46:51,537
I guess I'll wait for you
at the bar with the others.

847
00:46:51,538 --> 00:46:52,508
Great show!

848
00:46:52,509 --> 00:46:53,771
Thanks.

849
00:46:56,480 --> 00:46:58,448
As I was saying you
came in really late there.

850
00:46:58,649 --> 00:46:59,843
But it's okay,
I covered for you!

851
00:47:06,890 --> 00:47:07,857
Please come home.

852
00:47:08,225 --> 00:47:10,090
I can't we're on a flow.

853
00:47:10,260 --> 00:47:12,125
It sounds like you're
having a party.

854
00:47:12,296 --> 00:47:13,354
we're just taking
a little break.

855
00:47:13,564 --> 00:47:15,361
You've been writing
for two days straight.

856
00:47:15,532 --> 00:47:16,556
Isn't it cool?

857
00:47:16,733 --> 00:47:17,859
Baby I miss you.

858
00:47:18,235 --> 00:47:20,203
I thought we could spend
some time together.

859
00:47:20,370 --> 00:47:22,361
Just you and me
like normal couples do.

860
00:47:22,539 --> 00:47:23,597
well we're working.

861
00:47:23,774 --> 00:47:26,242
Besides you're busy with your play
and the short film...

862
00:47:26,410 --> 00:47:28,810
and if you get that part
you'll be in L.A. for months.

863
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,204
The more reason for us
to spend time together.

864
00:47:31,381 --> 00:47:34,475
It's not a competition you know.
It's two a. m.

865
00:47:34,651 --> 00:47:36,846
Baby, please come home
to sleep tonight.

866
00:47:37,221 --> 00:47:38,415
You can go back
to work in the morning.

867
00:47:38,589 --> 00:47:39,317
I gotta go!

868
00:47:39,489 --> 00:47:42,219
Look I'll talk to you
tomorrow after work.

869
00:47:42,426 --> 00:47:44,553
Je t'aime pour toujours.

870
00:47:45,796 --> 00:47:48,492
God, isn't his boytriend
so annoying.

871
00:47:48,665 --> 00:47:51,429
Yeah, that's why
I don't do relationships.

872
00:47:51,835 --> 00:47:54,633
Yeah, that and the fact
that no one wants you.

873
00:47:54,805 --> 00:47:56,363
Bitch.

874
00:47:58,675 --> 00:48:00,700
Thanks guys.
I'll talk to you soon. Bye.

875
00:48:00,878 --> 00:48:02,539
Good night Ben!

876
00:48:04,748 --> 00:48:06,181
You just hate all my friends.

877
00:48:06,350 --> 00:48:07,408
I don't hate Ben,

878
00:48:07,584 --> 00:48:10,314
I just don't see why you would
invite him along to the movies.

879
00:48:10,487 --> 00:48:12,648
This was our first night off
together in two weeks.

880
00:48:12,823 --> 00:48:15,883
Ben is my friend.
And he was lonely tonight.

881
00:48:16,727 --> 00:48:18,319
But you don't want me
to have any friends.

882
00:48:18,428 --> 00:48:19,725
why aren't we important to you?

883
00:48:19,897 --> 00:48:20,864
what do you mean?

884
00:48:20,964 --> 00:48:23,489
we. You and me.
why aren't we more important to you?

885
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,795
Is it so strange to want to spend
some time alone with your boytriend?

886
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:29,496
I find it very strange
that you don't seem to care.

887
00:48:29,606 --> 00:48:30,368
Of course I care.

888
00:48:30,374 --> 00:48:31,274
It doesn't seem like it.

889
00:48:31,275 --> 00:48:32,207
I care!

890
00:48:32,309 --> 00:48:34,607
You spend three times as much time
with April as you do with me.

891
00:48:34,711 --> 00:48:35,609
we're working together.

892
00:48:35,779 --> 00:48:38,839
Besides we have to get our demo
ready for that manager.

893
00:48:39,249 --> 00:48:42,275
why do you bring April up anyway?
Everything is not her fault you know.

894
00:48:42,452 --> 00:48:43,316
I'm not so sure.

895
00:48:43,487 --> 00:48:44,476
what's that supposed to mean?

896
00:48:44,688 --> 00:48:46,588
I don't know.
You seem so different now.

897
00:48:46,757 --> 00:48:48,190
The more time you spend
with her the less...

898
00:48:48,358 --> 00:48:51,350
I don't wanna hear any shit
about my sister!

899
00:49:03,440 --> 00:49:04,839
I got the part.

900
00:49:05,509 --> 00:49:06,601
You got the part?

901
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:10,671
I'm flying to LAThursday.
we start rehearsals Monday.

902
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:13,274
So soon!

903
00:49:13,583 --> 00:49:16,677
wow that's amazing!
Congratulations, baby.

904
00:49:16,853 --> 00:49:17,945
So how long will you be gone?

905
00:49:18,322 --> 00:49:19,220
A month.

906
00:49:21,258 --> 00:49:23,624
So April could stay here
while you're gone right?

907
00:49:23,794 --> 00:49:26,661
It's going to be really tough for her
now that she's changing sex again.

908
00:49:26,863 --> 00:49:27,921
It's just temporarily of course,

909
00:49:28,298 --> 00:49:30,766
she wouldn't dream of sticking around
while you're back.

910
00:49:31,435 --> 00:49:34,233
Do you promise me that she
will be gone before I come home?

911
00:49:34,404 --> 00:49:35,564
Of course!
Oh thank you baby.

912
00:49:35,739 --> 00:49:37,730
Let me call her
and tell her the good news.

913
00:49:37,908 --> 00:49:39,466
You know, it will be
really hard to go.

914
00:49:39,676 --> 00:49:40,802
why?
It'll be fun won't it?

915
00:49:40,978 --> 00:49:43,538
It's hard because you seem
so indifferent about it.

916
00:49:45,015 --> 00:49:47,882
No, baby, of course not.
And I miss you already.

917
00:49:48,318 --> 00:49:51,981
But listen. I'll just focus
on my work while your gone...

918
00:49:52,356 --> 00:49:53,345
And when you get back,

919
00:49:53,623 --> 00:49:55,818
I'll have several new songs
to play you.

920
00:50:01,965 --> 00:50:04,525
So Kyle told me
you're gonna be a man again.

921
00:50:04,701 --> 00:50:08,660
Yep.
Implants come out tomorrow.

922
00:50:09,940 --> 00:50:12,500
So you're not really
a woman then?

923
00:50:13,844 --> 00:50:14,776
what?

924
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:16,505
On the inside.

925
00:50:17,881 --> 00:50:19,280
It's not that simple.

926
00:50:19,449 --> 00:50:21,041
well its too bad.

927
00:50:21,451 --> 00:50:22,281
what?

928
00:50:22,719 --> 00:50:25,313
I never got a chance
to play with them.

929
00:50:25,856 --> 00:50:27,346
You wanna touch them?

930
00:50:28,892 --> 00:50:29,984
Go ahead.

931
00:50:30,727 --> 00:50:32,388
They're kinda hard
trom the scar tissue though.

932
00:50:32,629 --> 00:50:34,062
well they look good.

933
00:50:34,731 --> 00:50:36,858
I know.
I'm gonna miss them.

934
00:50:43,940 --> 00:50:45,999
Yeah you're right.
They feel fake.

935
00:50:48,779 --> 00:50:49,812
Oh, it's okay.

936
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:52,543
I'm sure you'll make
a good looking man too.

937
00:50:52,716 --> 00:50:56,413
Of course.
Not that you'll care.

938
00:50:56,920 --> 00:50:58,911
No I'm already married to one.

939
00:51:00,123 --> 00:51:02,648
Right.
That one.

940
00:51:03,894 --> 00:51:07,489
You know Marcel didn't seem
too happy before he left for LA.

941
00:51:07,664 --> 00:51:10,428
I think something's
going on with Kyle.

942
00:51:11,468 --> 00:51:14,869
well you know that's life.
Nothing lasts forever.

943
00:51:16,506 --> 00:51:19,737
Are you serious?
They might break up?

944
00:51:20,410 --> 00:51:22,071
I always thought they'd
be the ones to prove

945
00:51:22,512 --> 00:51:25,072
that gay relationships
can last forever.

946
00:51:28,485 --> 00:51:32,353
well, I for one never thought
they were right for each other.

947
00:51:36,593 --> 00:51:38,026
Your tum.

948
00:51:42,799 --> 00:51:44,767
They don't know when
the shooting will start now.

949
00:51:45,402 --> 00:51:46,892
Apparently they lost
some of the financing,

950
00:51:47,070 --> 00:51:48,367
it might be another week.

951
00:51:49,639 --> 00:51:51,470
Listen, honey,
I'm not happy here.

952
00:51:51,641 --> 00:51:53,370
I miss you terribly.

953
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:56,935
Do you?
Are you sure?

954
00:51:57,114 --> 00:51:58,479
Of course I'm sure.

955
00:51:59,749 --> 00:52:00,681
where's April?

956
00:52:00,851 --> 00:52:03,081
Look I gotta go.
Sarah just arrived.

957
00:52:04,421 --> 00:52:06,651
I love you too.
Bye.

958
00:52:07,724 --> 00:52:08,748
Bye.

959
00:52:11,194 --> 00:52:15,528
Cole is in the bedroom sleeping.
They gave him a lot of drugs.

960
00:52:15,699 --> 00:52:18,634
Really?
Is he gonna use them all?

961
00:52:20,003 --> 00:52:24,497
Her chest is all fucked up.
They say they can restore it though.

962
00:52:25,675 --> 00:52:27,404
His chest.

963
00:52:27,577 --> 00:52:28,601
I don't get it.

964
00:52:28,778 --> 00:52:30,712
I thought all trannys were
supposed to be certain

965
00:52:30,947 --> 00:52:33,916
they were bom the wrong sex
in order to go through with all of that.

966
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:37,451
well some probably are
but Cole never was.

967
00:52:37,621 --> 00:52:40,488
This isn't the first time
he's gone back to being a boy.

968
00:52:40,657 --> 00:52:41,555
Really?

969
00:52:41,858 --> 00:52:44,850
Anyway, he needs
a lot of support right now.

970
00:52:45,095 --> 00:52:47,120
Luckily Marcel isn't home.

971
00:52:50,033 --> 00:52:53,696
You know...
I'm feeling really sad.

972
00:52:54,070 --> 00:52:56,095
why?
Because you miss him?

973
00:52:56,473 --> 00:52:59,135
No.
Because I don't miss him.

974
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,480
I so hope it works out
with you two.

975
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:10,112
He can be so egocentric.
It's all about him.

976
00:53:11,054 --> 00:53:12,078
Actors!

977
00:53:12,489 --> 00:53:13,683
I know.

978
00:53:19,129 --> 00:53:20,596
You look great.

979
00:53:20,797 --> 00:53:22,958
I'm not ready for a photo shoot.

980
00:53:23,600 --> 00:53:26,194
we really need those new
promo shots of you.

981
00:53:27,938 --> 00:53:30,099
And it's time you start
leaving the house.

982
00:53:30,507 --> 00:53:31,735
Are you sure I look okay?

983
00:53:31,975 --> 00:53:35,911
Of course!
Just stop tweezing those eyebrows.

984
00:53:36,079 --> 00:53:38,707
Yeah, you should be talking!

985
00:53:43,053 --> 00:53:44,680
Cole, can I ask you something?

986
00:53:46,289 --> 00:53:48,723
If it's about you know who,
you know what I think.

987
00:53:48,892 --> 00:53:50,553
It was so good.

988
00:53:51,761 --> 00:53:53,991
It was supposed to last forever.

989
00:53:54,164 --> 00:53:55,688
You know Kyle,

990
00:53:56,266 --> 00:53:58,860
it's better to have
loved and lost...

991
00:53:59,035 --> 00:54:03,495
than to spend the rest of your life
with a controlling, self serving SOB.

992
00:54:19,222 --> 00:54:22,680
# When you weren't around
I was okay #

993
00:54:23,293 --> 00:54:26,558
# I used to have time
formyfriends all day #

994
00:54:26,730 --> 00:54:29,927
# When you weren't around
I was alright #

995
00:54:30,100 --> 00:54:33,263
# I need sometime
alone tonight #

996
00:54:33,770 --> 00:54:37,536
# So what will you do
if I leave you here alone #

997
00:54:37,774 --> 00:54:41,073
# How will you feel
if I won't be coming home #

998
00:54:41,344 --> 00:54:45,781
# Cause I got myself to save
so I might be gone #

999
00:54:45,949 --> 00:54:48,577
# if you call on me tonight #

1000
00:54:48,985 --> 00:54:52,284
# Between love and goodbye #

1001
00:54:52,789 --> 00:54:56,088
# I won't be living
in the middle this time #

1002
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:59,751
# Between love and goodbye #

1003
00:55:00,263 --> 00:55:04,097
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find #

1004
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:14,802
I called and I called,
where were you last night?

1005
00:55:15,078 --> 00:55:16,272
I was around.

1006
00:55:16,646 --> 00:55:19,945
Your cell was off.
And I called you at home three times.

1007
00:55:20,650 --> 00:55:22,777
Why didn't you call me back?
Where wereyou last night?

1008
00:55:22,886 --> 00:55:23,818
I was home.

1009
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:25,978
So didn't you hear me
on the answering machine?

1010
00:55:26,156 --> 00:55:27,589
No, I did.

1011
00:55:27,924 --> 00:55:29,152
But you didn't pick up?

1012
00:55:29,793 --> 00:55:32,591
I didn't feel like talking
to anyone last night.

1013
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:33,694
Kyle?

1014
00:55:33,863 --> 00:55:34,795
Yes.

1015
00:55:34,964 --> 00:55:36,761
You screen me out?

1016
00:55:37,367 --> 00:55:40,200
Me, your boyfriend,
you didn't pick up when I called?

1017
00:55:40,370 --> 00:55:41,268
Marcel...

1018
00:55:41,638 --> 00:55:42,832
No you told me many many times

1019
00:55:43,006 --> 00:55:45,133
no matter what
you would always love me.

1020
00:55:45,308 --> 00:55:46,297
I just need a little time.

1021
00:55:46,409 --> 00:55:47,273
No.

1022
00:55:47,644 --> 00:55:48,372
Just a little time...

1023
00:55:48,645 --> 00:55:49,612
No way.
No!

1024
00:55:49,713 --> 00:55:50,611
To figure things out!

1025
00:55:50,714 --> 00:55:53,080
what things?
what?

1026
00:55:53,750 --> 00:55:55,650
You wanna take a break
is that what you're saying?

1027
00:55:55,752 --> 00:55:56,946
I don't really know what I want.

1028
00:55:57,053 --> 00:56:01,615
Just... Please don't make
this harder than it has to be.

1029
00:56:01,825 --> 00:56:04,885
I'm already miserable as it is
being away trom home...

1030
00:56:05,061 --> 00:56:07,359
But you see this as
a great opportunity to break up.

1031
00:56:07,731 --> 00:56:11,098
I'm not breaking up.
I just need some time alone, okay?

1032
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,733
Let's just not talk for a while.

1033
00:56:15,839 --> 00:56:17,363
Let's just figure this out.

1034
00:56:18,808 --> 00:56:21,140
You can't pretend
you didn't see this coming.

1035
00:56:21,311 --> 00:56:23,040
I'm not pretending.

1036
00:56:26,816 --> 00:56:30,752
# The thought of
losing you tonight #

1037
00:56:31,721 --> 00:56:33,916
# Makes me wanna
stay and fight #

1038
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:37,821
# But I can't touch
what you believe #

1039
00:56:38,061 --> 00:56:40,757
# Should I leave #

1040
00:56:45,468 --> 00:56:48,995
# Between love and goodbye #

1041
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:52,398
# I won't be living
in the middle this time #

1042
00:56:52,909 --> 00:56:56,106
# Between love and goodbye #

1043
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:59,974
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find. #

1044
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:04,154
# Between love and goodbye #

1045
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:19,198
what the...?

1046
00:57:22,472 --> 00:57:25,805
I think Cole and I are going
to go over to my place.

1047
00:57:26,109 --> 00:57:27,337
Right Cole?

1048
00:57:28,311 --> 00:57:29,744
Sure.

1049
00:57:38,922 --> 00:57:42,050
I tried not to call either
so that you would miss me.

1050
00:57:42,225 --> 00:57:44,853
But you didn't,
so I had to come home.

1051
00:57:46,930 --> 00:57:49,091
They cut my best scenes anyway.

1052
00:57:49,265 --> 00:57:51,790
My agent wasn't very happy
about it though

1053
00:57:51,968 --> 00:57:54,334
but I couldn't
stay away any longer.

1054
00:57:55,872 --> 00:57:58,807
So you're saying you want me
to give our relationship another chance?

1055
00:57:58,875 --> 00:57:59,775
No.

1056
00:57:59,776 --> 00:58:00,509
No?

1057
00:58:00,510 --> 00:58:04,446
No I want you, us,
to give it several new chances,

1058
00:58:04,814 --> 00:58:06,145
Unlimited tries.

1059
00:58:06,316 --> 00:58:10,013
what I want is for us
to never give up. Never.

1060
00:58:10,253 --> 00:58:14,189
But to keep adjusting,
and trying and fixing...

1061
00:58:14,357 --> 00:58:17,793
And loving.
Forever!

1062
00:58:18,194 --> 00:58:20,287
To never give up!

1063
00:58:21,097 --> 00:58:23,190
That's what I want.

1064
00:59:16,886 --> 00:59:17,944
Baby you're crying.

1065
00:59:21,391 --> 00:59:23,086
Kyle, what's wrong?

1066
00:59:25,395 --> 00:59:26,885
Please tell me.

1067
00:59:29,265 --> 00:59:32,029
whatever it is
we can fix it together.

1068
00:59:32,569 --> 00:59:34,298
Something happened.

1069
00:59:36,506 --> 00:59:38,133
what?

1070
01:00:22,518 --> 01:00:23,985
It's okay.

1071
01:00:27,256 --> 01:00:28,951
I forgive you.

1072
01:00:31,194 --> 01:00:32,388
No.

1073
01:00:34,163 --> 01:00:35,892
No, it's not okay.

1074
01:00:36,699 --> 01:00:39,668
How can you just
forgive me like that?

1075
01:00:42,038 --> 01:00:43,665
I was away.

1076
01:00:45,441 --> 01:00:48,137
You felt lonely and horny.

1077
01:00:50,213 --> 01:00:52,181
These things happen sometimes.

1078
01:00:52,348 --> 01:00:54,578
Have these things
happened to you?

1079
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,284
No.

1080
01:01:03,159 --> 01:01:05,184
Marcel this is really important.

1081
01:01:05,561 --> 01:01:07,927
The fact that you don't seem
to care that I did,

1082
01:01:08,097 --> 01:01:10,497
tells me that you
probably did too.

1083
01:01:14,037 --> 01:01:15,231
Once.

1084
01:01:18,074 --> 01:01:19,234
You did?

1085
01:01:24,647 --> 01:01:28,640
Oh God I promised myself
I'd never tell you this...

1086
01:01:32,221 --> 01:01:34,519
but, last spring,

1087
01:01:35,692 --> 01:01:38,456
while you were away in Ohio...

1088
01:01:39,062 --> 01:01:42,122
I met this guy at the Phoenix.

1089
01:01:43,766 --> 01:01:44,562
Yeah?

1090
01:01:45,234 --> 01:01:48,635
Nothing really happened.
There was just this...

1091
01:01:49,105 --> 01:01:50,572
strong attraction,

1092
01:01:50,773 --> 01:01:54,675
and then we kind of
left together.

1093
01:01:55,445 --> 01:01:59,108
I mean, we were both
going in the same direction.

1094
01:01:59,182 --> 01:02:00,240
Did you have sex with him?

1095
01:02:00,416 --> 01:02:02,316
No, definitely not.

1096
01:02:04,654 --> 01:02:06,383
I don't know why,

1097
01:02:07,590 --> 01:02:10,150
I went upstairs with him.

1098
01:02:11,260 --> 01:02:15,390
It was just so exciting.

1099
01:02:16,399 --> 01:02:18,697
And I only stayed
for a little bit.

1100
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,002
But you didn't sleep with him?

1101
01:02:21,170 --> 01:02:24,230
No.
Of course not.

1102
01:02:26,409 --> 01:02:30,106
He just...
sucked me off a little.

1103
01:02:32,548 --> 01:02:34,641
Did you suck him off a little?

1104
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,419
I guess...
a little.

1105
01:02:40,389 --> 01:02:41,413
How could you?

1106
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,148
I don't know.

1107
01:02:44,527 --> 01:02:46,324
I didn't mean to.

1108
01:02:47,296 --> 01:02:49,491
And it meant nothing.

1109
01:02:50,700 --> 01:02:54,693
And I felt so guilty
about it ever since.

1110
01:02:59,242 --> 01:03:01,608
we were so happy together then.

1111
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:05,213
I know.

1112
01:03:10,319 --> 01:03:12,617
It had nothing to do with you.

1113
01:03:13,189 --> 01:03:16,317
And it didn't mean
I loved you any less.

1114
01:03:16,492 --> 01:03:18,392
It just kind of happened.

1115
01:03:18,561 --> 01:03:20,620
Has it happened again?

1116
01:03:20,797 --> 01:03:22,424
No.

1117
01:03:23,633 --> 01:03:25,692
Definitely not.

1118
01:03:29,238 --> 01:03:31,729
Please, it meant nothing.

1119
01:03:33,109 --> 01:03:34,770
It meant everything.

1120
01:03:37,446 --> 01:03:39,175
Lea will be here any minute,

1121
01:03:39,348 --> 01:03:41,475
so you have to go
as soon as she comes okay?

1122
01:03:43,119 --> 01:03:44,313
How do I look?

1123
01:03:44,654 --> 01:03:46,815
You could fix
your hair a little.

1124
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:51,590
whatever. It's not like
it's a date anyway.

1125
01:03:51,794 --> 01:03:53,819
I met her at a poetry reading.

1126
01:03:54,263 --> 01:03:58,256
She's just coming over
for some mac and cheese.

1127
01:04:01,237 --> 01:04:05,503
Look, Marcel, just stay out
of his face for a while okay?

1128
01:04:05,741 --> 01:04:06,867
whatever you do,

1129
01:04:07,243 --> 01:04:10,303
don't try to contront him
or make him change his mind.

1130
01:04:10,479 --> 01:04:12,538
You know you can be
a little bit obsessive.

1131
01:04:12,715 --> 01:04:14,546
Not attractive.

1132
01:04:18,855 --> 01:04:20,880
Just give him some space.

1133
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:22,588
And some time.

1134
01:04:22,892 --> 01:04:24,757
You know you shouldn't
have come home like that.

1135
01:04:24,927 --> 01:04:27,418
And you shouldn't have
told him about the cheating.

1136
01:04:27,597 --> 01:04:28,529
Big mistake.

1137
01:04:28,698 --> 01:04:29,756
I know.

1138
01:04:32,935 --> 01:04:34,698
Oh.
Time to go.

1139
01:04:38,875 --> 01:04:41,810
I do hope it works out
between you.

1140
01:04:44,513 --> 01:04:46,879
You shouldn't have
told him about the cheating.

1141
01:04:51,854 --> 01:04:52,650
Hi.

1142
01:04:52,822 --> 01:04:55,222
Hi.
Come on in.

1143
01:05:09,438 --> 01:05:12,430
# Although we know
it isn't right #

1144
01:05:13,276 --> 01:05:16,541
# It didn't stop us
from making a scene tonight. #

1145
01:05:16,746 --> 01:05:21,240
# I should've seen that you were
making your way outta here #

1146
01:05:23,552 --> 01:05:26,680
# It's not the first time,
but it's the last #

1147
01:05:26,856 --> 01:05:30,451
# I guarantee you'll be trying
to win me back #

1148
01:05:30,760 --> 01:05:35,823
# If you could get out
of that mirror #

1149
01:05:36,499 --> 01:05:39,662
# You're a born loser,
you're out of your mind #

1150
01:05:39,835 --> 01:05:42,861
# You're a born loser,
and I was so blind #

1151
01:05:43,272 --> 01:05:45,638
# You're a born loser, loser #

1152
01:05:45,808 --> 01:05:49,244
# You're losing me
for good this time #

1153
01:05:49,412 --> 01:05:52,813
# You're losing me
for good this time #

1154
01:06:05,261 --> 01:06:08,628
# You run around
telling all your friends #

1155
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:12,234
# My little secrets,
I told you in confidence #

1156
01:06:12,401 --> 01:06:16,667
# And all the stories
are making a star out of me #

1157
01:06:19,342 --> 01:06:21,970
# You got the act
and drama down #

1158
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:26,305
# You turn them all against me
in this town #

1159
01:06:26,449 --> 01:06:31,751
# Am I the only one who sees? #

1160
01:06:31,921 --> 01:06:35,254
# You're a born loser,
you're out of your mind #

1161
01:06:35,424 --> 01:06:38,552
# You're a born loser,
and I was so blind #

1162
01:06:38,728 --> 01:06:40,855
# You're a born loser #

1163
01:06:41,530 --> 01:06:44,624
# You're losing me
for good this time #

1164
01:06:44,834 --> 01:06:48,531
# You're losing me
for good this time #

1165
01:07:00,082 --> 01:07:03,279
# You 're gonna lose me #

1166
01:07:03,552 --> 01:07:06,350
# You're a born loser #

1167
01:07:06,889 --> 01:07:09,983
# You 're gonna lose me #

1168
01:07:10,426 --> 01:07:13,452
# You're born a loser #

1169
01:07:13,696 --> 01:07:16,790
# You're a born loser,
you're out of your mind #

1170
01:07:17,066 --> 01:07:20,365
# You're a born loser,
and I was so blind #

1171
01:07:20,569 --> 01:07:22,696
# You're a born loser #

1172
01:07:22,972 --> 01:07:27,705
# You're losing me
for good this time #

1173
01:07:42,792 --> 01:07:47,661
You once told me that the most loving
couple of seconds of your day,

1174
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:52,590
is when you hear my keys in the door
and you realize that I am home.

1175
01:07:53,636 --> 01:07:55,365
Your baby's home.

1176
01:07:55,638 --> 01:07:57,663
Do you remember that?

1177
01:07:58,641 --> 01:08:03,044
Now you're telling me you don't wanna
hear my keys in the door anymore?

1178
01:08:03,446 --> 01:08:05,641
That you don't want
me to come home?

1179
01:08:06,449 --> 01:08:08,041
Ever again?

1180
01:08:09,518 --> 01:08:12,453
I mean it's just...
I just don't get it!

1181
01:08:12,721 --> 01:08:16,851
It's so crazy. It's so ludicrous
that it's impossible to...

1182
01:08:17,426 --> 01:08:19,360
You're telling me that...

1183
01:08:20,096 --> 01:08:21,563
You're telling me that...

1184
01:08:21,630 --> 01:08:23,598
I'm telling you that
I don't love you anymore.

1185
01:08:23,766 --> 01:08:26,758
No. Kyle how can you
not love me anymore?

1186
01:08:27,169 --> 01:08:28,966
You used to love me
so much that...

1187
01:08:29,138 --> 01:08:31,003
Right Marcel.
Used to.

1188
01:08:31,474 --> 01:08:33,101
Get it?
Try to understand,

1189
01:08:33,476 --> 01:08:35,706
I don't love you anymore.

1190
01:08:36,479 --> 01:08:39,937
we stopped having fun together
and it's time to move on.

1191
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,450
You asked me to marry you!

1192
01:08:44,653 --> 01:08:46,644
You can't decide it's over
because we're not having fun.

1193
01:08:46,822 --> 01:08:48,050
I mean come on!
we can change that.

1194
01:08:48,124 --> 01:08:49,157
How?

1195
01:08:49,158 --> 01:08:51,524
well, we can go to therapy to...

1196
01:08:52,828 --> 01:08:54,125
To find out...

1197
01:08:54,630 --> 01:08:56,757
That's ridiculous.
That's so fucking stupid!

1198
01:08:56,932 --> 01:08:58,991
Listen, there are so many,
many things that we can do...

1199
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:00,965
spend more time
together, for one,

1200
01:09:01,170 --> 01:09:03,138
go away together, perhaps?

1201
01:09:03,506 --> 01:09:06,475
The important thing is that
we can fix this together!

1202
01:09:08,110 --> 01:09:12,547
For the longest time I gave away all
my power to you, and you took it.

1203
01:09:12,715 --> 01:09:14,182
I'm not about
to redo that mistake.

1204
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:15,915
Are those your word or April's?

1205
01:09:16,085 --> 01:09:18,952
His name is Cole.
And no I can speak for myself.

1206
01:09:19,121 --> 01:09:21,954
Marcel it's time to face the facts.
It's over.

1207
01:09:22,124 --> 01:09:24,752
No it's not. Stop saying that.
we can fight this!

1208
01:09:24,960 --> 01:09:27,053
I don't know which part of this
you don't understand.

1209
01:09:27,229 --> 01:09:30,164
I don't want to.
And that is that.

1210
01:09:30,533 --> 01:09:33,934
I'm an artist.
And I have to follow my heart.

1211
01:09:34,103 --> 01:09:37,163
And my heart tells me,
it's over.

1212
01:09:37,606 --> 01:09:39,801
well, my heart
tells me that it's not.

1213
01:09:40,075 --> 01:09:42,703
I don't know why
you're acting so surprised.

1214
01:09:43,078 --> 01:09:43,908
Honey -

1215
01:09:44,246 --> 01:09:45,440
Life sucks.

1216
01:09:46,949 --> 01:09:49,679
You win some,
you lose some.

1217
01:10:12,541 --> 01:10:14,475
I always used to debate...

1218
01:10:14,777 --> 01:10:16,005
Am I in love?

1219
01:10:16,178 --> 01:10:18,169
This feels like love, right?

1220
01:10:18,581 --> 01:10:20,242
Is this real love?

1221
01:10:20,849 --> 01:10:22,840
I've only known you for a week.

1222
01:10:23,085 --> 01:10:24,916
Not even a week.

1223
01:10:26,088 --> 01:10:28,522
But now I know
what real love feels like.

1224
01:10:28,791 --> 01:10:31,123
I told you.
As soon as our eyes met,

1225
01:10:31,560 --> 01:10:32,720
I just knew.

1226
01:10:35,864 --> 01:10:37,161
Hey how do you
say that in French?

1227
01:10:37,166 --> 01:10:38,199
Say what?

1228
01:10:38,200 --> 01:10:39,690
I love you.

1229
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:41,628
Je t'aime.

1230
01:10:41,870 --> 01:10:43,269
J'taime.

1231
01:10:43,939 --> 01:10:45,065
Forever?

1232
01:10:45,708 --> 01:10:47,505
Pour toujours.

1233
01:10:49,545 --> 01:10:51,513
Je t'taime, Marcel.

1234
01:10:51,814 --> 01:10:53,645
Pour toujours.

1235
01:11:35,224 --> 01:11:38,318
I wrote him a love letter,
like you told me, saying goodbye.

1236
01:11:38,694 --> 01:11:39,854
And I didn't give it to him.

1237
01:11:40,029 --> 01:11:41,860
I hid it in one of his books.

1238
01:11:42,031 --> 01:11:45,000
Maybe one day he will find it,
and realize how much he misses me.

1239
01:11:45,167 --> 01:11:46,065
You know, Jenny,

1240
01:11:46,235 --> 01:11:47,964
sometimes I think
it would've been better

1241
01:11:48,137 --> 01:11:49,900
if he had died
when he still loved me.

1242
01:11:50,072 --> 01:11:52,597
Then it would've been forever
like he promised.

1243
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:56,709
Marcel, it's really important
to turn inwards in times of crisis.

1244
01:11:56,879 --> 01:11:58,244
All the answers are inside.

1245
01:11:58,614 --> 01:12:00,775
You're gonna feel
so much better after this.

1246
01:12:00,949 --> 01:12:03,281
It's all in the breathing!

1247
01:12:16,231 --> 01:12:18,222
So when are you moving out?

1248
01:12:18,834 --> 01:12:22,133
well I thought I'd just keep staying
with Cole in the living room for now,

1249
01:12:22,304 --> 01:12:23,931
and you can keep the bedroom.

1250
01:12:24,139 --> 01:12:26,130
That's not going to happen.

1251
01:12:26,342 --> 01:12:29,675
If you're breaking up with me,
then you're out of here.

1252
01:12:29,845 --> 01:12:31,335
And your brother too.

1253
01:12:32,047 --> 01:12:33,241
I can't live like this.

1254
01:12:33,415 --> 01:12:36,043
well, I'm sorry, but you really
don't have a choice.

1255
01:12:37,319 --> 01:12:40,288
So you're going to bring home
your boytriends, and I mine?

1256
01:12:40,756 --> 01:12:43,156
If you have a problem with that,
why don't you move out?

1257
01:12:43,359 --> 01:12:44,883
First you break up with me,

1258
01:12:45,060 --> 01:12:47,654
then you tell me
to move out of my own apartment.

1259
01:12:47,830 --> 01:12:49,957
It's mine as much as its yours.

1260
01:12:51,200 --> 01:12:53,191
whose name is not on the lease?

1261
01:12:53,769 --> 01:12:54,895
Technically it's all mine.

1262
01:12:55,003 --> 01:12:57,369
That was just so you and Sarah
could both be on the lease.

1263
01:12:57,439 --> 01:12:58,872
we moved in here together.

1264
01:12:58,941 --> 01:12:59,839
I found this place.

1265
01:12:59,908 --> 01:13:01,671
You made one phone call
to your landlord.

1266
01:13:01,844 --> 01:13:02,970
I worked hard to get it.

1267
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:04,112
You didn't do shit.

1268
01:13:04,346 --> 01:13:06,405
The point is;
you're breaking up with me.

1269
01:13:06,782 --> 01:13:09,080
I will get the money together
by the first to buy you out

1270
01:13:09,251 --> 01:13:10,946
of your share of the furniture.

1271
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,384
Maybe you can move in with Ben
until you find a place.

1272
01:13:13,756 --> 01:13:14,848
And what about Cole?

1273
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:17,753
Oh, now I'm responsible
for your brother too?

1274
01:13:18,127 --> 01:13:20,925
Your white trash family sure knows how
to take advantage of people.

1275
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,657
why don't you just pack your little bags
and go back to France, huh?

1276
01:13:25,701 --> 01:13:26,963
You're single.

1277
01:13:27,336 --> 01:13:29,201
I don't see what's
keeping you in New York.

1278
01:13:29,371 --> 01:13:31,236
You're not wanted here anymore.

1279
01:13:31,940 --> 01:13:33,168
You wanna buy me out?

1280
01:13:33,409 --> 01:13:35,343
Most of this stuff here is mine.

1281
01:13:35,711 --> 01:13:37,201
Oh that's right,
you don't have any money...

1282
01:13:37,379 --> 01:13:39,244
and I don't belive your brother
had an income

1283
01:13:39,415 --> 01:13:40,973
since he stopped prostituting.

1284
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:41,911
Again.

1285
01:13:42,084 --> 01:13:44,348
You just want me to give you
everything, is that it?

1286
01:13:44,720 --> 01:13:46,813
You're an asshole.
And I'm not moving out.

1287
01:13:46,989 --> 01:13:49,822
No. You're the asshole
and I'm talking to you.

1288
01:13:50,292 --> 01:13:52,082
Can you believe
he threatened Kyle with a knife?

1289
01:13:52,261 --> 01:13:53,421
I mean the guy is losing it.

1290
01:13:53,829 --> 01:13:54,853
How do you feel, Kyle?

1291
01:13:55,030 --> 01:13:56,429
Are you sure
this is it for you two?

1292
01:13:56,799 --> 01:13:59,393
I mean, I thought you were just taking
some time to figure things out.

1293
01:13:59,768 --> 01:14:01,167
You two had a good thing going.

1294
01:14:01,336 --> 01:14:02,928
They did not have
a good thing going.

1295
01:14:03,172 --> 01:14:04,366
whatever they had it wasn't love

1296
01:14:04,740 --> 01:14:06,435
because love is about
respecting each other.

1297
01:14:07,142 --> 01:14:08,234
If Marcel ever loved Kyle,

1298
01:14:08,410 --> 01:14:11,038
he wouldn't treat his triends
and his family so poorly.

1299
01:14:11,213 --> 01:14:12,111
He's a user.

1300
01:14:12,281 --> 01:14:14,044
He used you
and he used Kyle.

1301
01:14:14,216 --> 01:14:17,117
Maybe Marcel and I
used each other.

1302
01:14:17,853 --> 01:14:19,343
How did he use you, Kyle?

1303
01:14:19,855 --> 01:14:21,789
Look, Marcel's
not a good person.

1304
01:14:22,057 --> 01:14:24,218
Kyle has no interest in getting
back together with him.

1305
01:14:24,393 --> 01:14:25,382
Or even talking with him.

1306
01:14:25,761 --> 01:14:28,389
If Marcel has anything to say to Kyle,
it needs to go through you.

1307
01:14:28,764 --> 01:14:30,231
we're done with him!

1308
01:14:31,867 --> 01:14:34,097
So how about you two
move into Danny's room

1309
01:14:34,269 --> 01:14:35,998
and Danny moves in with Marcel?

1310
01:14:36,171 --> 01:14:37,001
what?

1311
01:14:37,239 --> 01:14:39,104
I told you,
you have to move out soon.

1312
01:14:39,274 --> 01:14:40,741
You're getting on my nerves.

1313
01:14:40,909 --> 01:14:42,001
It's out of the question.

1314
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:44,304
we're not giving up
that apartment.

1315
01:14:44,780 --> 01:14:46,509
It's Kyle's apartment
just as much as yours.

1316
01:14:46,882 --> 01:14:49,749
I won't help you take him to court.
I just won't!

1317
01:14:49,918 --> 01:14:51,010
So let's solve this.

1318
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:52,414
I can't live with Danny.

1319
01:14:52,788 --> 01:14:53,982
Come on we all agreed to this!

1320
01:14:54,156 --> 01:14:55,748
He's such a slob!

1321
01:14:55,924 --> 01:14:56,822
Marcel!

1322
01:14:57,059 --> 01:14:58,151
It was your idea.

1323
01:14:58,327 --> 01:14:59,487
I changed my mind.

1324
01:14:59,862 --> 01:15:01,762
You know it wasn't easy
convincing Kyle.

1325
01:15:01,930 --> 01:15:03,261
He feels like it's
letting you win.

1326
01:15:03,432 --> 01:15:05,263
I'm not happy about the terms.

1327
01:15:05,434 --> 01:15:08,301
Besides if we do this,
I need to discuss it with Kyle.

1328
01:15:08,470 --> 01:15:10,131
He won't speak to you.

1329
01:15:10,305 --> 01:15:12,136
Then there is no deal.

1330
01:15:19,114 --> 01:15:21,344
Oh hi Kyle.
I made dinner for us.

1331
01:15:21,517 --> 01:15:24,816
I thought we should sit down
for a meal, and talk things out.

1332
01:15:24,987 --> 01:15:27,387
I think we owe it to ourselves.

1333
01:15:29,224 --> 01:15:29,986
Kyle?

1334
01:15:30,158 --> 01:15:30,988
Please?

1335
01:15:31,193 --> 01:15:32,785
I'm not hungry.

1336
01:15:38,033 --> 01:15:39,830
Kyle, we need to talk.

1337
01:15:40,002 --> 01:15:43,199
If we're going to do this apartment
switch, we need to discuss the details.

1338
01:15:43,272 --> 01:15:44,933
Sarah told me you said no to it.

1339
01:15:45,107 --> 01:15:46,938
If you changed your mind,
it can go through her.

1340
01:15:47,109 --> 01:15:49,236
No it can't.
I need to talk to you.

1341
01:15:49,411 --> 01:15:51,003
Look, this is
really hard for me.

1342
01:15:51,113 --> 01:15:53,809
I think it would be easier if we
were able to part as friends.

1343
01:15:53,982 --> 01:15:54,846
Just go.

1344
01:15:55,484 --> 01:15:58,419
I really don't think we have anything else
to say to each other.

1345
01:15:58,854 --> 01:15:59,911
Ever.

1346
01:16:04,459 --> 01:16:06,893
Je t'aime pour toujours.

1347
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:10,127
Yeah, yeah, yeah...

1348
01:16:10,332 --> 01:16:12,197
I know you seem to think so.

1349
01:16:12,367 --> 01:16:15,859
I did come across
your little note, by the way.

1350
01:16:19,007 --> 01:16:20,269
Dear Kyle...

1351
01:16:21,209 --> 01:16:24,372
I am crying as
I sit here writing this.

1352
01:16:24,913 --> 01:16:27,347
How could this happen
between us?

1353
01:16:27,616 --> 01:16:31,450
Your beautiful eyes that used
to be filled with so much love,

1354
01:16:31,887 --> 01:16:33,354
are now completely cold.

1355
01:16:33,522 --> 01:16:35,615
And then it goes on to say...

1356
01:16:35,991 --> 01:16:37,253
well you should know...

1357
01:16:37,526 --> 01:16:39,050
You wrote it.

1358
01:16:39,494 --> 01:16:43,430
It's more of the same
pathetic, needy shit really.

1359
01:16:48,437 --> 01:16:51,634
No wonder your mother
put her head into that oven.

1360
01:16:52,007 --> 01:16:55,033
I used to think that was
a strange thing for a mother to do.

1361
01:16:55,210 --> 01:16:57,974
Abandon a four and
a six-year old like that.

1362
01:16:58,146 --> 01:17:01,582
But hey! It's all really
quite clear to me now.

1363
01:17:01,950 --> 01:17:06,182
In fact your mother was probably the only
sane person in your family.

1364
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:11,221
Get the fuck out of my room.

1365
01:17:11,927 --> 01:17:12,916
Now.

1366
01:17:24,573 --> 01:17:26,905
Stop obsessing about him.

1367
01:17:27,075 --> 01:17:28,975
I'm not obsessing,
I just don't understand...

1368
01:17:29,144 --> 01:17:32,443
It doesn't matter Marcel.
You have to move on.

1369
01:17:32,614 --> 01:17:33,478
But he...

1370
01:17:33,649 --> 01:17:37,278
I think he's made it very clear that he's
not interested right now.

1371
01:17:37,619 --> 01:17:38,551
You have to let it go.

1372
01:17:38,620 --> 01:17:39,382
I can't!

1373
01:17:39,554 --> 01:17:40,680
You have to!

1374
01:17:40,681 --> 01:17:41,489
Come on.

1375
01:17:41,490 --> 01:17:45,620
He's never gonna come around if you
make yourself so available and needy.

1376
01:17:45,994 --> 01:17:48,189
Date...
Fuck around...

1377
01:17:48,363 --> 01:17:51,025
like all the other gay boys do.

1378
01:17:51,566 --> 01:17:53,534
You have to move on Marcel.

1379
01:17:56,071 --> 01:17:57,629
Oh hi!

1380
01:17:58,073 --> 01:17:59,472
Rob this is my roommate, Kyle.

1381
01:17:59,675 --> 01:18:00,699
Kyle, this is Rob.

1382
01:18:01,076 --> 01:18:03,101
Rob, sit down
while I make us a drink.

1383
01:18:03,278 --> 01:18:04,973
Ciao.
How you doing?

1384
01:18:06,014 --> 01:18:07,242
Oh, don't worry about him.

1385
01:18:07,416 --> 01:18:10,180
He's just a little upset,
because his name is not on the lease,

1386
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:11,444
and if he doesn't move out,

1387
01:18:11,620 --> 01:18:14,612
I will have his things thrown out
on the street and change the locks.

1388
01:18:15,424 --> 01:18:16,288
Sorry.

1389
01:18:16,458 --> 01:18:17,322
Don't be.

1390
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:19,687
If he does,
I'll have him arrested.

1391
01:18:20,095 --> 01:18:21,653
You see, according to
New York State law...

1392
01:18:22,030 --> 01:18:25,659
you can't kick a person out of a place,
who's lived there over a month.

1393
01:18:26,034 --> 01:18:30,095
So both me, and my
brother Cole, are staying.

1394
01:18:30,639 --> 01:18:34,336
I can't believe I didn't dump
this guy a long time ago though.

1395
01:18:34,509 --> 01:18:35,737
But, you know what?

1396
01:18:37,079 --> 01:18:38,706
Rob... is it?

1397
01:18:39,414 --> 01:18:43,373
Now that I did, I can't
tell you how right it feels.

1398
01:18:43,585 --> 01:18:46,713
You see, Marcel is really
a selfish, pathetic creep.

1399
01:18:47,089 --> 01:18:49,489
would you like
some tresh lemon, Rob?

1400
01:18:50,525 --> 01:18:52,220
You see the problem with Kyle...

1401
01:18:52,394 --> 01:18:54,555
is that he will never
be happy with anyone,

1402
01:18:54,730 --> 01:18:58,257
as long as lets his
fucking brother run his life.

1403
01:18:58,633 --> 01:19:02,194
If there was ever a selfish person
in our relationship,

1404
01:19:02,437 --> 01:19:03,237
It was Cole.

1405
01:19:03,238 --> 01:19:05,365
Cole was right about you
the whole time.

1406
01:19:05,540 --> 01:19:07,440
You're just a mean,
petty son-of-a-bitch.

1407
01:19:07,609 --> 01:19:10,669
I guess this is what happens
when you invite homeless, unemployed,

1408
01:19:11,046 --> 01:19:14,015
ex-transsexual prostitutes
into your home.

1409
01:19:14,349 --> 01:19:15,782
They turn your loved ones
against you.

1410
01:19:16,184 --> 01:19:17,276
I was wrong.

1411
01:19:17,452 --> 01:19:19,010
I never loved you.

1412
01:19:19,187 --> 01:19:20,484
If you don't leave,

1413
01:19:20,655 --> 01:19:22,282
I will take you both
to housing court.

1414
01:19:22,457 --> 01:19:25,153
You can't! Sarah says I have
equal rights to this place.

1415
01:19:25,327 --> 01:19:27,295
Sarah is his wife!

1416
01:19:27,462 --> 01:19:30,556
who's also on the lease.
And she says we can stay.

1417
01:19:30,732 --> 01:19:31,562
Your wife?

1418
01:19:32,100 --> 01:19:33,328
whatever.

1419
01:19:33,502 --> 01:19:36,300
Drinks are ready.
Let's go.

1420
01:19:38,673 --> 01:19:40,106
Goodnight, Kyle!

1421
01:19:41,676 --> 01:19:43,200
Oh my God...

1422
01:19:43,845 --> 01:19:45,710
I love you lips...

1423
01:19:46,848 --> 01:19:49,339
You got such a gorgeous body...

1424
01:20:00,428 --> 01:20:01,690
You have to leave now.

1425
01:20:02,430 --> 01:20:03,419
what?

1426
01:20:03,598 --> 01:20:06,362
we're finished.
I want you to go.

1427
01:20:07,402 --> 01:20:08,300
what's wrong?

1428
01:20:08,703 --> 01:20:10,102
we just got going...

1429
01:20:11,673 --> 01:20:13,265
I can tell you liked it.

1430
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:14,669
Just leave.

1431
01:20:19,181 --> 01:20:20,478
You treak!

1432
01:20:20,682 --> 01:20:23,242
who do you think you are,
treating me like this?

1433
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:25,783
There were plenty of guys
I could've gone home with.

1434
01:20:26,154 --> 01:20:28,486
Good. Go find yourself
someone else to fuck.

1435
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,521
what kind of game
are you playing anyway?

1436
01:20:30,692 --> 01:20:32,785
Your right it was just a game.
All pretend.

1437
01:20:33,161 --> 01:20:34,628
You can't satisfy me one bit.

1438
01:20:34,796 --> 01:20:35,854
Cocksucker!

1439
01:20:37,232 --> 01:20:38,232
You wish.

1440
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,427
You have to get back at him.

1441
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:42,661
I really don't feel
like having sex with anybody.

1442
01:20:42,838 --> 01:20:44,772
Especially not with you
in the same room.

1443
01:20:45,140 --> 01:20:47,370
So why don't you make
that one little phone call?

1444
01:20:47,542 --> 01:20:49,442
It'll all be over.

1445
01:20:50,445 --> 01:20:52,640
You tell him I'm this close
to having him deported.

1446
01:20:52,881 --> 01:20:56,146
Kyle! You are a sweet,
wonderful person,

1447
01:20:56,318 --> 01:20:57,842
How can you
even think of doing that?

1448
01:20:58,253 --> 01:20:59,743
He'd only have himself to blame.

1449
01:20:59,921 --> 01:21:00,721
Kyle!

1450
01:21:00,722 --> 01:21:01,450
what?

1451
01:21:01,623 --> 01:21:02,817
He cheated on me,

1452
01:21:03,191 --> 01:21:04,852
and he didn't tell me
about it for a year.

1453
01:21:05,227 --> 01:21:06,227
Is that what this is about?

1454
01:21:06,228 --> 01:21:07,388
Among other things.

1455
01:21:07,562 --> 01:21:09,359
You've seen the way
he's been acting up lately,

1456
01:21:09,598 --> 01:21:11,361
and I'm not gonna let him
get that apartment for nothing.

1457
01:21:11,533 --> 01:21:12,522
Come on!

1458
01:21:12,701 --> 01:21:15,135
Everything isn't
black and white, you know.

1459
01:21:15,303 --> 01:21:16,497
There are ways to solve this.

1460
01:21:16,671 --> 01:21:18,639
I know.
One phone call.

1461
01:21:19,441 --> 01:21:22,376
You're stupid to believe that
he would do that Sarah!

1462
01:21:22,711 --> 01:21:24,804
Nobody would ever do that.

1463
01:21:25,180 --> 01:21:28,172
Even if he would do it to me,
he couldn't possibly do it to you.

1464
01:21:29,184 --> 01:21:31,482
Please, Kyle,
we can still solve this.

1465
01:21:31,653 --> 01:21:33,245
I'll kick Danny out.

1466
01:21:33,421 --> 01:21:36,322
You and Cole can have this apartment.
I'll move in with Marcel.

1467
01:21:36,491 --> 01:21:37,389
Kick me out?

1468
01:21:37,559 --> 01:21:40,323
You can't kick me out.
My name's on the lease!

1469
01:21:40,495 --> 01:21:42,588
Only because my name
had to be on Marcel's lease.

1470
01:21:42,764 --> 01:21:44,789
You know very well
this is my apartment!

1471
01:21:44,966 --> 01:21:46,831
But, where am I gonna go?

1472
01:21:47,202 --> 01:21:48,669
You're not going anywhere.

1473
01:21:48,837 --> 01:21:50,600
It's too late Sarah.

1474
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,603
Marcel's not gonna get away
with his little games.

1475
01:21:52,674 --> 01:21:53,709
Not this time.

1476
01:21:53,710 --> 01:21:55,608
Please! Kyle for my sake.

1477
01:21:55,777 --> 01:21:57,608
I can get jail time for this!

1478
01:21:57,779 --> 01:21:59,508
Nothing will happen to you,
if you cooperate.

1479
01:21:59,614 --> 01:22:00,672
You don't know that!

1480
01:22:00,849 --> 01:22:02,476
They may say that now,

1481
01:22:02,651 --> 01:22:04,915
but I already lied
to immigration under oath.

1482
01:22:05,287 --> 01:22:06,515
That's a federal offense!

1483
01:22:06,688 --> 01:22:08,383
Listen we're gonna do this with
or without you.

1484
01:22:08,556 --> 01:22:10,183
You're so stupid Sarah.

1485
01:22:10,926 --> 01:22:12,291
Please.

1486
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:14,860
For my sake, don't call!

1487
01:22:15,230 --> 01:22:16,288
I'll try to keep you out of it.

1488
01:22:16,464 --> 01:22:19,922
You can't keep me out of it,
I'm married to him!

1489
01:22:20,302 --> 01:22:21,860
This is so fucked up!

1490
01:22:22,237 --> 01:22:23,534
He's been asking for this.

1491
01:22:23,738 --> 01:22:24,898
Are you gonna cooperate?

1492
01:22:25,340 --> 01:22:27,900
No, Kyle!
You're fucked up!

1493
01:22:28,343 --> 01:22:29,640
I got the number at my place.
Let's go.

1494
01:22:29,641 --> 01:22:30,611
Kyle!

1495
01:22:30,612 --> 01:22:33,513
Kyle. No, Kyle, please.
Please, Kyle, just wait...

1496
01:22:36,017 --> 01:22:37,575
Sure I can hold.

1497
01:22:37,886 --> 01:22:38,944
Kyle.

1498
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:41,983
Kyle, please don't.

1499
01:22:42,357 --> 01:22:44,416
Yes.
My name is Kyle Thomas.

1500
01:22:45,427 --> 01:22:48,453
I'd like to report
a case of immigration traud.

1501
01:22:51,933 --> 01:22:54,265
His name is Marcel Collard.

1502
01:22:59,341 --> 01:23:00,672
How could you?

1503
01:23:01,276 --> 01:23:03,335
And you, Sarah, how could you?

1504
01:23:03,979 --> 01:23:06,539
Don't you dare blame me.

1505
01:23:07,349 --> 01:23:09,544
You guys are all fucked up!

1506
01:23:09,818 --> 01:23:11,479
Come on Sarah,

1507
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:14,353
you know the freak deserved it.

1508
01:23:14,656 --> 01:23:16,851
How could you do
something so cruel?

1509
01:23:17,025 --> 01:23:18,458
You underestimated me.

1510
01:23:18,560 --> 01:23:19,788
I thought more of you than that.

1511
01:23:19,894 --> 01:23:20,792
You cheated on me!

1512
01:23:20,793 --> 01:23:21,729
And you on me!

1513
01:23:21,730 --> 01:23:22,492
well, it's done.

1514
01:23:22,664 --> 01:23:24,598
Call them back.
Tell them it was a mistake.

1515
01:23:24,766 --> 01:23:26,495
Just get the fuck out
of my room.

1516
01:23:26,868 --> 01:23:27,800
No.

1517
01:23:27,969 --> 01:23:29,630
This, in fact,
is my living room.

1518
01:23:29,704 --> 01:23:30,762
Get the fuck out of my room.

1519
01:23:30,839 --> 01:23:33,399
Don't you touch me again
or I'll kill you.

1520
01:23:33,475 --> 01:23:34,305
Get the fuck out of here now!

1521
01:23:34,476 --> 01:23:35,465
You better watch it.

1522
01:24:18,820 --> 01:24:20,310
Fuck!

1523
01:24:20,488 --> 01:24:22,479
I'm gonna fucking kill you!

1524
01:24:26,094 --> 01:24:27,459
what the fuck?

1525
01:24:28,763 --> 01:24:29,855
How dare you
threaten my brother?

1526
01:24:30,065 --> 01:24:32,465
I'm gonna call the cops
and have you arrested!

1527
01:24:37,806 --> 01:24:39,740
Bleeding a little are we?

1528
01:24:42,544 --> 01:24:44,068
Je t'aime Marcel.

1529
01:24:44,512 --> 01:24:45,911
Pour toujours.

1530
01:24:52,020 --> 01:24:55,080
# I wonderwhy the hell
I stayin this town #

1531
01:24:55,824 --> 01:24:58,622
# Ain't much to do
when the sun goes down #

1532
01:24:59,127 --> 01:25:03,723
# But think about what I'll do
when I'm with you. #

1533
01:25:06,768 --> 01:25:09,794
# Still don't know
why you went away #

1534
01:25:10,505 --> 01:25:13,702
# When black and white
turns into grey #

1535
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:18,579
# Life is cold but I was warm
when I kissed you. #

1536
01:25:19,514 --> 01:25:21,505
Mr. Kyle Thomas
has already been here.

1537
01:25:21,683 --> 01:25:23,651
Filed charges against you.

1538
01:25:23,818 --> 01:25:25,513
For harassment and assault.

1539
01:25:26,654 --> 01:25:28,815
So what?
Is it his word against mine?

1540
01:25:29,524 --> 01:25:30,821
No, not exactly.

1541
01:25:31,092 --> 01:25:34,721
He didn't show up with five stitches
and a report from the E.R.

1542
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:37,055
we'll have him
arrested for this.

1543
01:25:37,999 --> 01:25:39,058
Oh.

1544
01:25:39,100 --> 01:25:42,399
# Eternity burned out that day #

1545
01:25:42,570 --> 01:25:47,872
# And I don't know how
I'm gonna spend my life without you. #

1546
01:25:49,477 --> 01:25:53,413
# And the church bells
are ringing all across the world #

1547
01:25:53,581 --> 01:25:56,675
# And prophesies
go unfulfilled #

1548
01:25:56,851 --> 01:26:01,811
# Cause they always told me
I would spend my life with you #

1549
01:26:02,624 --> 01:26:05,991
# I won't say adieu #

1550
01:26:07,862 --> 01:26:09,796
I don't know about this Cole,

1551
01:26:10,198 --> 01:26:12,189
Do you think I even
have a case against him?

1552
01:26:12,600 --> 01:26:13,498
Of course.

1553
01:26:13,668 --> 01:26:15,761
That's why they want you
to come back and testify again.

1554
01:26:15,937 --> 01:26:18,462
The way he behaved
was totally unacceptable.

1555
01:26:18,640 --> 01:26:19,698
Threatening you with a knife!

1556
01:26:19,874 --> 01:26:20,932
Threatening to kill you!

1557
01:26:21,109 --> 01:26:24,078
The cops saw the bruises you had.
He's gonna have to pay.

1558
01:26:24,646 --> 01:26:28,582
Mr. Thomas, stand up.
And please turn around.

1559
01:26:28,750 --> 01:26:31,082
You're under arrest
for assault and battery.

1560
01:26:31,252 --> 01:26:32,742
You have the right
to remain silent.

1561
01:26:32,921 --> 01:26:35,685
Anything you say can and will
be held against you in a court of law.

1562
01:26:35,857 --> 01:26:36,824
You have the right
to an attomey.

1563
01:26:36,991 --> 01:26:38,481
If you can't afford one,
we'll provide one for you.

1564
01:26:38,482 --> 01:26:39,259
No, you can't do this.

1565
01:26:39,260 --> 01:26:40,457
You understand your rights?
- Yes.

1566
01:26:40,628 --> 01:26:41,686
It's the other way around.

1567
01:26:41,863 --> 01:26:43,854
# When I'm with you
my heart pounds like rain #

1568
01:26:43,932 --> 01:26:47,561
# When I'm with you
I'm immune to pain #

1569
01:26:47,735 --> 01:26:51,136
# When I'm with you
I feel no restraint #

1570
01:26:51,506 --> 01:26:53,531
# When I'm with you #

1571
01:26:54,976 --> 01:26:59,003
# And I don't know how
I'm gonna live this way #

1572
01:26:59,214 --> 01:27:02,081
# Eternity burned out that day #

1573
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:07,120
# And I don't know how
I'm gonna spend my life without you #

1574
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,254
I just got out.

1575
01:27:09,624 --> 01:27:11,615
I'm not allowed to go
back to the apartment.

1576
01:27:11,859 --> 01:27:13,156
Luckily Ben was home.

1577
01:27:14,262 --> 01:27:17,527
It looks like Marcel won
this little battle after all.

1578
01:27:17,699 --> 01:27:22,033
# And they always told me
I would spend my life with you #

1579
01:27:22,237 --> 01:27:26,196
# I won't say adieu #

1580
01:27:28,643 --> 01:27:30,577
You may have gotten rid of Kyle,

1581
01:27:30,878 --> 01:27:32,539
but your not getting rid of me.

1582
01:27:32,714 --> 01:27:35,012
And I'm your new roommate until
immigration picks you up

1583
01:27:35,183 --> 01:27:36,207
and puts you on
that plane to France.

1584
01:27:36,618 --> 01:27:37,550
It wont be long now.

1585
01:27:37,719 --> 01:27:40,586
You put domestic violence
on your charges against Kyle

1586
01:27:40,755 --> 01:27:42,848
You stupid fuck!

1587
01:27:47,562 --> 01:27:49,621
This whole thing is messed up.

1588
01:27:50,999 --> 01:27:53,263
My advice to you,
just hang tight.

1589
01:27:53,635 --> 01:27:56,229
Immigration is
completely backed up.

1590
01:27:56,604 --> 01:28:00,096
They weren't able to give them
the case number. Right?

1591
01:28:01,209 --> 01:28:04,144
Chances are they'll never be able
to put this thing together.

1592
01:28:04,646 --> 01:28:07,638
# Eternity burned out that day #

1593
01:28:07,882 --> 01:28:08,906
# And I don't know... #

1594
01:28:09,350 --> 01:28:11,181
He says if I move out,

1595
01:28:11,619 --> 01:28:15,146
he'll pay you for your share
of the furniture and the security deposit.

1596
01:28:15,356 --> 01:28:17,153
I told him to keep dreaming.

1597
01:28:17,325 --> 01:28:19,919
Ben says we can
stay here for a while.

1598
01:28:20,328 --> 01:28:22,626
He could use
the extra rent money.

1599
01:28:22,797 --> 01:28:23,957
No way.

1600
01:28:24,332 --> 01:28:26,232
we can't let Marcel win.

1601
01:28:26,634 --> 01:28:29,728
when immigration picks him up
the apartment will be ours.

1602
01:28:30,805 --> 01:28:32,796
I just have to stick it out
a little while longer.

1603
01:28:33,041 --> 01:28:34,167
Let's not.

1604
01:28:34,942 --> 01:28:37,274
You're gonna let the asshole
get away with this?

1605
01:28:37,745 --> 01:28:39,235
I can't fucking believe this!

1606
01:28:39,614 --> 01:28:41,309
Look you got what you wanted,

1607
01:28:41,816 --> 01:28:44,876
Marcel and I will never
get back together now.

1608
01:28:45,720 --> 01:28:47,017
You won.

1609
01:28:50,992 --> 01:28:53,153
The D.A. has agreed to
let him off with a waming

1610
01:28:53,695 --> 01:28:55,094
if he agrees to assault charges.

1611
01:28:55,863 --> 01:28:58,798
And if he stays out of trouble,
he wont get a record.

1612
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,931
Okay.
Sounds good.

1613
01:29:01,102 --> 01:29:02,763
Here's the paperwork
where Kyle signs off

1614
01:29:04,238 --> 01:29:06,206
on the apartment
and everything in it.

1615
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:11,142
Great. Here's the
money order for the fumiture.

1616
01:29:11,946 --> 01:29:13,277
we're all set then.

1617
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:18,042
would you please tell Kyle
that I would like to speak with him?

1618
01:29:18,219 --> 01:29:19,652
For some closure?

1619
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:21,615
Not in this lifetime.

1620
01:29:23,057 --> 01:29:25,025
well, congratulations
on the apartment.

1621
01:29:25,226 --> 01:29:27,126
Congratulations on Kyle.

1622
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:28,259
You did good.

1623
01:29:28,429 --> 01:29:29,259
Please,

1624
01:29:30,098 --> 01:29:31,690
You did it yourself.

1625
01:29:33,234 --> 01:29:35,998
So when I broke up with Julie,
she got so vengeful,

1626
01:29:36,170 --> 01:29:38,297
She called my job
and told them I was stealing.

1627
01:29:38,673 --> 01:29:40,732
And I got fired.

1628
01:29:41,075 --> 01:29:45,375
But if that hadn't happened, I would've
never gotten the job at the cafe.

1629
01:29:45,880 --> 01:29:49,077
And I wouldn't have been there
when Sarah came in for the poetry reading.

1630
01:29:49,250 --> 01:29:50,842
what she's saying is that
you never really know

1631
01:29:51,085 --> 01:29:52,143
what's waiting for you in life.

1632
01:29:52,420 --> 01:29:54,115
That's the beauty of it!

1633
01:29:54,422 --> 01:29:56,890
It is pretty exciting.

1634
01:29:57,058 --> 01:29:59,424
My life is completely open
to anything now.

1635
01:29:59,827 --> 01:30:02,421
I mean, who knows
who I will spend my next Christmas with?

1636
01:30:02,830 --> 01:30:04,661
or who I'll meet
a year from now?

1637
01:30:04,899 --> 01:30:06,890
where I will live
ten years trom now?

1638
01:30:07,368 --> 01:30:10,997
Life is pretty dam exciting
if one looks at all the possibilities.

1639
01:30:11,239 --> 01:30:14,072
You know there will always
be sunshine after it rains.

1640
01:30:14,142 --> 01:30:16,269
For something new to start
something old has to end.

1641
01:30:16,444 --> 01:30:19,675
Anything is possible.
Anything can happen.

1642
01:30:19,847 --> 01:30:20,905
Then there is still hope.

1643
01:30:21,082 --> 01:30:22,276
Of course!

1644
01:30:24,218 --> 01:30:26,686
Then there will always
be hope...

1645
01:30:29,724 --> 01:30:31,020
# Yes I rememberlove, #

1646
01:30:31,055 --> 01:30:32,317
# Yes I remember love, #

1647
01:30:32,727 --> 01:30:35,218
# So beautiful #

1648
01:30:35,863 --> 01:30:41,426
# Now I know how hard
this breakup was #

1649
01:30:41,803 --> 01:30:44,363
# Cause I remember love #

1650
01:30:44,739 --> 01:30:47,264
# The true meaning of #

1651
01:30:47,809 --> 01:30:50,300
# I remember... #

1652
01:30:50,745 --> 01:30:55,239
# I remember... Love #

1653
01:30:55,416 --> 01:30:56,883
Marcel Colard?

1654
01:30:58,085 --> 01:31:00,019
Are you Marcel Colard?

1655
01:31:00,188 --> 01:31:01,382
Yes, that's me.

1656
01:31:01,823 --> 01:31:04,155
United States Citizenship
and Immigration service...

1657
01:31:04,325 --> 01:31:06,316
we're conducting an
investigation because we have

1658
01:31:06,494 --> 01:31:09,054
strong reason to believe
that you've lied to the US govemment.

1659
01:31:09,230 --> 01:31:10,197
what?

1660
01:31:10,398 --> 01:31:12,992
why? Because somebody called
and told you some crazy story?

1661
01:31:13,167 --> 01:31:14,361
No we've got more than that,

1662
01:31:14,535 --> 01:31:17,003
witnesses, photographs,
letters, love notes,

1663
01:31:17,171 --> 01:31:20,072
All indicating that you've
engaged in marriage fraud

1664
01:31:20,241 --> 01:31:23,176
in order to gain admittance
into the United States.

1665
01:31:23,945 --> 01:31:26,243
we need you
to come with us, sir.

1666
01:31:29,083 --> 01:31:30,983
what the fuck did you do?

1667
01:31:32,420 --> 01:31:34,183
It's better this way.

1668
01:31:35,089 --> 01:31:37,353
Should we move back in?

1669
01:31:49,136 --> 01:31:51,104
Okay the hearing is set
in three weeks,

1670
01:31:51,272 --> 01:31:54,173
So call my office next week,
set up an appointment,

1671
01:31:54,342 --> 01:31:56,367
so we can
go over strategy, okay?

1672
01:32:01,249 --> 01:32:07,085
# Cause I remember love
so beautiful #

1673
01:32:07,555 --> 01:32:13,118
# Now I know my heart
is breakable #

1674
01:32:13,394 --> 01:32:16,295
# Yes I remember love #

1675
01:32:16,597 --> 01:32:19,122
# The true meaning of #

1676
01:32:19,901 --> 01:32:22,529
# I remember... #

1677
01:32:23,571 --> 01:32:25,095
You need you
to come with us sir.

1678
01:32:25,206 --> 01:32:27,071
# Love... #

1679
01:32:27,375 --> 01:32:33,177
# Oh, I've been losing faith
each time I fall #

1680
01:32:33,347 --> 01:32:34,439
No.

1681
01:32:36,217 --> 01:32:37,149
Marcel!

1682
01:32:37,251 --> 01:32:39,310
# But I still believe
love conquers all #

1683
01:32:41,255 --> 01:32:43,120
NO!

1684
01:32:43,958 --> 01:32:48,054
No! No!
Kyle! No! No!

1685
01:32:48,262 --> 01:32:52,392
# Now I know my heart
is breakable #

1686
01:32:52,567 --> 01:32:55,229
# But I remember love #

1687
01:32:55,403 --> 01:32:58,372
# The true meaning of #

1688
01:32:58,606 --> 01:33:01,370
# I remember... #

1689
01:33:02,209 --> 01:33:07,203
# I remember love
the true meaning of #

1690
01:33:07,648 --> 01:33:10,242
# I remember... #

1691
01:33:11,552 --> 01:33:16,285
# Yes, I remember so beautiful #

1692
01:33:16,557 --> 01:33:22,393
# Now I know my heart
is breakable #

1693
01:33:22,563 --> 01:33:28,563
# When we see your face
as I hear your voice #

1694
01:33:29,103 --> 01:33:31,867
# I remember... #

1695
01:33:32,173 --> 01:33:35,006
# Love #

1696
01:33:52,226 --> 01:33:55,457
# When you weren't around
I was OK #

1697
01:33:56,097 --> 01:33:59,362
# I used to have time
for my friends all day #

1698
01:33:59,567 --> 01:34:03,003
# When you weren't around
I was alright #

1699
01:34:03,170 --> 01:34:06,401
# I need some time
alone tonight #

1700
01:34:06,574 --> 01:34:10,237
# So what will yo do
if I leave you here alone? #

1701
01:34:10,444 --> 01:34:13,971
# And how will you feel
if I won't be coming home? #

1702
01:34:14,148 --> 01:34:16,343
# Cause I got myself to save #

1703
01:34:16,517 --> 01:34:21,386
# So I might be gone
if you call on me tonight #

1704
01:34:21,589 --> 01:34:25,423
# Between love and goodbye #

1705
01:34:25,593 --> 01:34:28,960
# I won't be living
in the middle this time #

1706
01:34:29,130 --> 01:34:32,657
# Between love and goodbye #

1707
01:34:33,034 --> 01:34:37,027
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find #

1708
01:34:51,252 --> 01:34:54,949
# When you weren't around
I was myself #

1709
01:34:55,122 --> 01:34:58,421
# I never had to think
of anyone else #

1710
01:34:58,592 --> 01:35:01,993
# When you weren't around
I always knew #

1711
01:35:02,163 --> 01:35:05,690
# Just where my life
was going to #

1712
01:35:06,067 --> 01:35:09,525
# So I can't create
what we haven't seen #

1713
01:35:09,737 --> 01:35:13,366
# But I can't escape
living in a dream #

1714
01:35:13,541 --> 01:35:15,736
# And my fear
is at it's height #

1715
01:35:16,110 --> 01:35:20,740
# So I might fall far
like the stars in heaven tonight #

1716
01:35:21,115 --> 01:35:24,744
# Between love and goodbye #

1717
01:35:25,119 --> 01:35:28,316
# I won't be living
in the middle this time #

1718
01:35:28,489 --> 01:35:32,289
# Between love and goodbye #

1719
01:35:32,460 --> 01:35:35,623
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find #

1720
01:35:50,411 --> 01:35:54,370
# The thought of
losing you tonight #

1721
01:35:55,116 --> 01:35:57,448
# Makes me wanna
stay and fight #

1722
01:35:57,618 --> 01:36:01,281
# But I can't touch
what you believe #

1723
01:36:01,522 --> 01:36:07,522
# Should I leave? #

1724
01:36:08,763 --> 01:36:12,699
# Between love and goodbye #

1725
01:36:13,067 --> 01:36:16,332
# I won't be living
in the middle this time #

1726
01:36:16,504 --> 01:36:20,099
# Between love and goodbye #

1727
01:36:20,274 --> 01:36:23,471
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find #

1728
01:36:23,644 --> 01:36:27,375
# Between love and goodbye #

1729
01:36:27,548 --> 01:36:31,109
# I got a heart of gold
you'll never find #

1730
01:36:31,285 --> 01:36:37,285
# Between love and goodbye #
