Good morning, sir.

56
00:10:40,498 --> 00:10:42,095
Edward Forester.

57
00:10:42,096 --> 00:10:44,603
Wow man, it's really Edward Forester.

58
00:10:44,604 --> 00:10:45,604
Holy sh...

59
00:10:46,705 --> 00:10:48,312

So please, come in.

64
00:10:55,847 --> 00:10:58,345
Yeah, oh yeah, wow.

66
00:11:00,427 --> 00:11:01,956
Holy mackerel.

67
00:11:01,957 --> 00:11:04,029
He's Edward Forester.

68
00:11:04,030 --> 00:11:07,221
Yeah sir, when I got your name and address

69
00:11:07,222 --> 00:11:09,509
on the work call here, you know I wondered

70
00:11:09,510 --> 00:11:12,037
maybe if it was another
Edward Forester type of deal,

71
00:11:12,038 --> 00:11:14,627
but look, it's you, it's the real deal.

72
00:11:14,628 --> 00:11:16,368
Appreciate it.

73
00:11:16,369 --> 00:11:17,982

Yeah.

00:11:22,798 --> 00:11:26,587
Can I offer you a coffee or an expresso?

76
00:11:26,588 --> 00:11:29,524
Oh no, nah sir, I don't
wanna impose, you know.

77
00:11:29,525 --> 00:11:33,814
I get up early, hit the gym,
grab a cup of Joe, you know,

78
00:11:33,815 --> 00:11:35,474
and get off to work and stuff like that.

79
00:11:35,475 --> 00:11:36,511
If I have more than one cup a day,

80
00:11:36,512 --> 00:11:38,244
I get the shits and the shits and stuff.

81
00:11:40,352 --> 00:11:42,939
So hey, what is this, Mr. Forester, sir?

00:12:59,716 --> 00:13:02,101

00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:32,513
Hi.

130
00:13:32,514 --> 00:13:34,969
Oh my God, I thought that was you.

131
00:13:34,970 --> 00:13:36,308
How's your show?

132
00:13:36,309 --> 00:13:39,252
Still waiting to hear if
we're picked up next season.

133
00:13:39,253 --> 00:13:40,384
Gorgeous car.

134
00:13:40,385 --> 00:13:42,782
A little present from me to me.

135
00:13:42,783 --> 00:13:44,622
What's going on with you?

136
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,699
Uh.

137
00:13:46,700 --> 00:13:48,775
I'll call you sometime and fill you in.

138
00:13:48,776 --> 00:13:49,859
You better.

139
00:13:58,877 --> 00:13:59,951
Did I see it?

140
00:13:59,952 --> 00:14:02,645
I was court side next to
Nicholson, are you kidding?

141
00:14:02,646 --> 00:14:05,169
I know the place exploded, yeah, ball,

142
00:14:05,170 --> 00:14:07,007
he crushed it right over Labram's head.

143
00:14:07,008 --> 00:14:08,425
It was fantastic.

144
00:14:09,636 --> 00:14:10,571
What?

145
00:14:10,572 --> 00:14:14,424
Edward's been on hold
for over five minutes.

146
00:14:15,257 --> 00:14:16,257
Okay.

147
00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:19,940
Listen, I gotta bounce.

148
00:14:19,941 --> 00:14:21,524
Tomorrow, I'm late.

149
00:14:24,344 --> 00:14:25,409
What line is he on?

150
00:14:25,410 --> 00:14:27,454
Four.

151
00:14:28,627 --> 00:14:29,626
Good morning, Edward.

152
00:14:29,627 --> 00:14:30,639
Sorry to have kept you waiting.

153
00:14:30,640 --> 00:14:31,616
That's quite all right.

154
00:14:31,617 --> 00:14:32,844
What's happening?

155
00:14:32,845 --> 00:14:34,993
Oh, you know, same old, same old.

156
00:14:34,994 --> 00:14:36,671
Still shoveling shit uphill.

157
00:14:36,672 --> 00:14:37,967
How goes it with you?

158
00:14:37,968 --> 00:14:40,909
Oh, just trying to get
settled into the new place.

159
00:14:40,910 --> 00:14:44,016
Actually I'm glad you called, Edward.

160
00:14:44,017 --> 00:14:47,634
There's some changes
going on at the agency.

161
00:14:47,635 --> 00:14:49,510
Call it a merger, if you will.

162
00:14:49,511 --> 00:14:51,941
But I was thinking it might be a good idea

163
00:14:51,942 --> 00:14:53,541
for you to meet a colleague of mine

164
00:14:53,542 --> 00:14:55,752
over at Triad before things start

165
00:14:55,753 --> 00:14:57,209
getting really ugly around here.

166
00:14:58,460 --> 00:14:59,795
You're dropping me.

167
00:14:59,796 --> 00:15:01,787
Edward, you've been far too successful

168
00:15:01,788 --> 00:15:03,343
and there's way too much well known water

169
00:15:03,344 --> 00:15:05,873
under the bridge for me to
just drop you, my old friend.

170
00:15:05,874 --> 00:15:08,457
No, think of it as a transition

171
00:15:09,310 --> 00:15:13,049
to another agency that
might be a better fit.

172
00:15:13,050 --> 00:15:14,301
A better fit?

173
00:15:14,302 --> 00:15:16,275
That's what you're calling it?

174
00:15:16,276 --> 00:15:18,203
Please don't make me
feel like a piece of shite.

175
00:15:18,204 --> 00:15:20,250
It's been nigh-on-impossible,
getting you a job

176
00:15:20,251 --> 00:15:22,048
since your little stunt
at the Rat Channel.

177
00:15:22,049 --> 00:15:23,961
Oh Adam, please.

178
00:15:23,962 --> 00:15:26,092
Don't use that as an
excuse for my not working.

179
00:15:26,093 --> 00:15:27,987
Well I know you went awol for a year,

180
00:15:27,988 --> 00:15:30,405
but Hollywood doesn't forget.

181
00:15:34,387 --> 00:15:36,812
Edward, Edward, just
think of it as a favor

182
00:15:36,813 --> 00:15:38,463
from me to you.

183
00:15:38,464 --> 00:15:40,602
Go see my boy at Triad.

184
00:15:40,603 --> 00:15:42,972
Adam, you know I can't
start over with a new agent,

185
00:15:42,973 --> 00:15:44,972
not at this phase in my career.

186
00:15:44,973 --> 00:15:46,974
The groundwork's already beset.

187
00:15:46,975 --> 00:15:49,374
Bethany will arrange a meeting.

188
00:15:49,375 --> 00:15:52,383
You've been a great
client and a good friend.

189
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:54,029
I'm just looking out for you.

190
00:15:54,030 --> 00:15:57,082
So I just wait to hear from Bethany.

191
00:15:57,083 --> 00:15:58,456
That's right.

192
00:15:58,457 --> 00:16:02,736
And Edward, I do truly hope
it turns around for you, pal.

193
00:16:02,737 --> 00:16:03,737
Chow babe.

194
00:16:05,000 --> 00:16:06,000
Oh actors.

195
00:16:06,955 --> 00:16:08,372
- Candy baby.
- Hi.

196
00:16:09,338 --> 00:16:11,319
- You got it.
- I got it, what part?

197
00:16:11,320 --> 00:16:12,815
Well what does it matter what part?

198
00:16:12,816 --> 00:16:15,119
It's six weeks in Miami and
you get your own driver.

199
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,357
Whoa, what kind of car?

200
00:16:16,358 --> 00:16:18,365
It's a smart car.

201
00:16:18,366 --> 00:16:19,366
Oh.

202
00:16:20,073 --> 00:16:22,920
A very smart, a limo type of car.

203
00:16:22,921 --> 00:16:24,635
And a thousand per diem a week.

204
00:16:24,636 --> 00:16:26,146
Oh my god, Mr. Stone.

205
00:16:26,147 --> 00:16:27,306
Oh you're amazing.

206
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,856
I try, Candy, I try.

207
00:16:29,857 --> 00:16:30,690
Thank you so much.

208
00:16:30,691 --> 00:16:32,304
You're welcome.

209
00:16:32,305 --> 00:16:33,138
Yes, Bethany.

210
00:16:33,139 --> 00:16:34,674
I have Mr.
Goldberg on line three.

211
00:16:34,675 --> 00:16:36,487
Well take a message.

212
00:16:36,488 --> 00:16:37,970
And you wife called and said

213
00:16:37,971 --> 00:16:40,108
to meet her at the yacht
club at six o'clock.

214
00:16:40,109 --> 00:16:41,314
Please try to be on time.

215
00:16:41,315 --> 00:16:43,124
Hold my calls.

216
00:16:43,125 --> 00:16:46,625

230
00:17:30,310 --> 00:17:31,622

238

241
00:17:56,819 --> 00:17:58,402
The man is a pig.

00:18:01,283 --> 00:18:04,158

You receive a median
of 18 thousand a year

253
00:18:45,089 --> 00:18:48,762
from residuals and an
additional six to seven

254
00:18:48,763 --> 00:18:53,141
from other sources,
averaging 25 thousand a year.

255
00:18:53,142 --> 00:18:56,379
In three years you'll be
eligible for social security,

256
00:18:56,380 --> 00:18:58,741
which will bring in
another 17 hundred a month.

257
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:01,970
However, with your impending taxes,

258
00:19:01,971 --> 00:19:05,400
living expenses, and other fixed costs,

259
00:19:05,401 --> 00:19:08,806
I think we need to look at
things as they really are.

260
00:19:08,807 --> 00:19:09,989
Right.

261
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,064
What about the money from
the sale of the house?

262
00:19:12,065 --> 00:19:14,525
Baby, that's in a
long-term CD as agreed,

263
00:19:14,526 --> 00:19:16,520
less the capital gains taxes.

264
00:19:16,521 --> 00:19:17,811
It's your safety net.

265
00:19:17,812 --> 00:19:20,174
Unfortunately, that money you donated

266
00:19:20,175 --> 00:19:21,980
to the Mission in Curamachga...

267
00:19:21,981 --> 00:19:22,814
Karamoja.

268
00:19:22,815 --> 00:19:24,306
Yeah, that one.

269
00:19:24,307 --> 00:19:26,150
It's not tax deductible.

270
00:19:26,151 --> 00:19:29,203
It wasn't certified 501.

271
00:19:29,204 --> 00:19:30,679
Okay.

272
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:31,868
What do you advise?

273
00:19:31,869 --> 00:19:33,452
Get back to work.

274
00:19:34,427 --> 00:19:37,890
Curve your spending, reduce your overhead.

275
00:19:37,891 --> 00:19:40,339
Other than that, Eddie, I
don't know what I can do.

276
00:19:40,340 --> 00:19:41,978
Reduce my overhead?

277
00:19:41,979 --> 00:19:44,515
Do you have the foggiest
idea where I live now?

278
00:19:44,516 --> 00:19:45,561
No.

279
00:19:45,562 --> 00:19:47,702
Well, it ain't Beverly Hills.

280
00:19:47,703 --> 00:19:49,928
Samuel, I'm an actor, that's what I do

281
00:19:49,929 --> 00:19:53,262
and I will climb my way back to the top.

282
00:19:56,411 --> 00:19:58,434
You know when your partner
left to start his own firm,

283
00:19:58,435 --> 00:20:00,522
I was one of the few who stayed on board.

284
00:20:00,523 --> 00:20:02,081
Do you remember that?

285
00:20:02,082 --> 00:20:03,658
And you know why?

286
00:20:03,659 --> 00:20:05,741
Please tell me.

287
00:20:05,742 --> 00:20:07,461
Because I trusted you

288
00:20:07,462 --> 00:20:09,900
and that's what friends do.

289
00:20:09,901 --> 00:20:11,809
Now I'm asking you to think long and hard

290
00:20:11,810 --> 00:20:13,652
about our history and return the loyalty.

291
00:20:15,277 --> 00:20:17,837
Eddie, I don't think
that there's anything more

292
00:20:17,838 --> 00:20:21,453
that we can do for you, I'm sorry.

293
00:20:21,454 --> 00:20:23,954
I really do wish you the best.

294
00:20:35,281 --> 00:20:36,281
Edward!

295
00:20:37,131 --> 00:20:38,859
Mr. Forester!

296
00:20:38,860 --> 00:20:40,851
Please, I need to speak with you.

297
00:20:40,852 --> 00:20:42,935
Let me park really quick.

298
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:53,771
Hello, sir.

299
00:20:53,772 --> 00:20:54,955
My name's Jeremy Robely.

300
00:20:54,956 --> 00:20:56,828
God, this so incredible.

301
00:20:56,829 --> 00:20:58,352
Yeah, how so?

302
00:20:58,353 --> 00:21:00,711
Your agent, Adam Stone, I believe,

303
00:21:00,712 --> 00:21:03,921
I sent him a script with
an offer to be in my movie.

304
00:21:03,922 --> 00:21:05,353
Really?

305
00:21:05,354 --> 00:21:06,372
When?

306
00:21:06,373 --> 00:21:08,084
A few weeks ago.

307
00:21:08,085 --> 00:21:11,833
But I never heard back,
so, just assumed a.

308
00:21:11,834 --> 00:21:14,059
Uh, have you made your film yet?

309
00:21:14,060 --> 00:21:16,989
No, no, we have a start date though.

310
00:21:16,990 --> 00:21:18,346
Who's director?

311
00:21:18,347 --> 00:21:20,126
You're looking at him.

312
00:21:20,127 --> 00:21:22,697
No worries, Mr. Forester,
I'm an SC Film School grad

313
00:21:22,698 --> 00:21:24,175
and I know my craft.

314
00:21:24,176 --> 00:21:25,834
Well that's refreshing.

315
00:21:25,835 --> 00:21:26,885
Jeremy, is it?

316
00:21:26,886 --> 00:21:28,304
Yes, sir.

317
00:21:28,305 --> 00:21:29,138
Well Jeremy, I'm in the middle

318
00:21:29,139 --> 00:21:31,644
of changing agents right now,
can I get your information

319
00:21:31,645 --> 00:21:33,982
and have my new representatives
get back to you?

320
00:21:33,983 --> 00:21:35,066
Definitely.

321
00:21:37,598 --> 00:21:39,774
Halfway to 60 Productions.

322
00:21:39,775 --> 00:21:41,236
I just turned 30.

323
00:21:41,237 --> 00:21:42,886
I have a script in the
car if you'd like one.

324
00:21:42,887 --> 00:21:44,574
That's okay, I'll have
someone get back to you

325
00:21:44,575 --> 00:21:45,812
and we'll go from there.

326
00:21:45,813 --> 00:21:47,574
I understand and no pressure,

327
00:21:47,575 --> 00:21:49,161
it's just we have to have a cast

328
00:21:49,162 --> 00:21:51,622
committed by end of next week.

329
00:21:51,623 --> 00:21:52,821
Fair enough.

330
00:21:52,822 --> 00:21:53,822
Okay.

331
00:21:54,871 --> 00:21:57,121
Can you pass me the script?

332
00:21:59,470 --> 00:22:01,301
Just happen to have a copy.

333
00:22:01,302 --> 00:22:04,723
The Best Medicine by Jeremy Robely.

334
00:22:04,724 --> 00:22:06,864
Who's Cutting Edge Entertainment?

335
00:22:06,865 --> 00:22:09,573
It's a independent film
studio in the valley.

336
00:22:09,574 --> 00:22:11,955
I think once you when the script,

337
00:22:11,956 --> 00:22:14,041
you'll understand why I want you

338
00:22:14,042 --> 00:22:17,342
to play Reginald T. Blauvelt the 3rd.

339
00:22:18,731 --> 00:22:21,175
Okay, I'll give it a read.

340
00:22:21,176 --> 00:22:22,009
Excellent.

341
00:22:22,010 --> 00:22:23,809
It's such a pleasure meeting you, sir.

342
00:22:23,810 --> 00:22:27,198
It's really important to me
that you're in this film.

343
00:22:27,199 --> 00:22:28,754
Thank you.

344
00:22:28,755 --> 00:22:32,048
I look forward to your
thoughts on the script.

345
00:22:32,049 --> 00:22:33,049
Be well.

346
00:22:50,530 --> 00:22:53,099
I got here as soon as I could.

347
00:22:53,100 --> 00:22:54,100
Alrighty.

348
00:22:54,898 --> 00:22:56,796
Ooh, that's a good one.

349
00:22:56,797 --> 00:22:57,905
Yeah.

350
00:22:57,906 --> 00:22:59,036
Yeah.

351
00:22:59,037 --> 00:23:01,750
It was 102, but last I
checked it dropped to a hundred.

352
00:23:01,751 --> 00:23:04,110
Oh good, good, good, good, okay.

353
00:23:04,111 --> 00:23:05,790
Let me get and move you.

354
00:23:05,791 --> 00:23:06,791
All right.

355
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:08,920
There we go.

356
00:23:11,820 --> 00:23:14,989
Catarina, can I speak with you a moment?

357
00:23:15,822 --> 00:23:16,655
Please.

358
00:23:16,656 --> 00:23:19,322
Sure.

359
00:23:20,233 --> 00:23:22,783
Listen, I know that my
check bounced last week

360
00:23:22,784 --> 00:23:24,160
and so if you could wait one more week,

361
00:23:24,161 --> 00:23:25,681
I promise I'll make it good.

362
00:23:25,682 --> 00:23:26,582
I will.

363
00:23:26,583 --> 00:23:29,522
Look, if it were up to
me, I'd watch him for free.

364
00:23:29,523 --> 00:23:32,159
You know it's not up to me, all right?

365
00:23:32,160 --> 00:23:33,260
You're behind on last month's,

366
00:23:33,261 --> 00:23:35,199
this month's already past due.

367
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:37,879
They wanna a Cashier's Check
for the full amount by Friday

368
00:23:37,880 --> 00:23:40,978
or you have to make other
arrangements for Matthew.

369
00:23:40,979 --> 00:23:41,979
I'm sorry.

370
00:23:43,531 --> 00:23:44,553
Okay?

371
00:23:44,554 --> 00:23:45,554
Okay.

372
00:23:55,273 --> 00:23:56,695
Adam Stone's office.

373
00:23:56,696 --> 00:23:57,961
Hi Bethany, it's Edward.

374
00:23:57,962 --> 00:23:59,501
Oh hi, Edward, are you looking for Adam?

375
00:23:59,502 --> 00:24:02,987
No actually, Bethany,
I wanted to talk to you.

376
00:24:02,988 --> 00:24:03,844
Oh what's up?

377
00:24:03,845 --> 00:24:05,237
Any word on scheduling a meeting

378
00:24:05,238 --> 00:24:07,224
with that agent from Triad?

379
00:24:07,225 --> 00:24:09,256
I'm sorry, I didn't get his name.

380
00:24:09,257 --> 00:24:11,202
Aaron Michaels, he's on vacation.

381
00:24:11,203 --> 00:24:14,060
Let me circle the wagons and
find out when he's due back.

382
00:24:14,061 --> 00:24:15,943
That would be much appreciated.

383
00:24:15,944 --> 00:24:19,173
I would really like to get
something in the books.

384
00:24:19,174 --> 00:24:23,033
Oh and Bethany, did you
get a spec-script for me

385
00:24:23,034 --> 00:24:26,993
called The Best Medicine from
a kid named Jeremy Robely?

386
00:24:26,994 --> 00:24:27,978
I don't think so,

387
00:24:27,979 --> 00:24:30,099
but you know how many
spec-scripts we get, I'll check.

388
00:24:30,681 --> 00:24:31,936
Oh, I gotta, I gotta get that.

389
00:24:31,937 --> 00:24:32,937
I'm sorry, Edward.

390
00:24:32,937 --> 00:24:33,937

I don't mean to seem ungrateful,

but I have an important
engagement this evening.

431
00:26:58,406 --> 00:27:00,515

448

Time to get back in the game.

449
00:28:29,101 --> 00:28:30,934
Get a water, please.

450
00:28:38,976 --> 00:28:40,309
Edward Forester?

00:28:43,028 --> 00:28:44,686
Harold Miller.

452
00:28:44,687 --> 00:28:45,825
Harold, pleasure to meet you.

453
00:28:45,826 --> 00:28:48,173
It's quite an honor.

454
00:28:48,174 --> 00:28:50,498
I grew up watching The Six.

455
00:28:50,499 --> 00:28:51,707
Never missed an episode.

456
00:28:51,708 --> 00:28:54,078
I even own it on DVD.

457
00:28:54,079 --> 00:28:55,484
The Six.

458
00:28:55,485 --> 00:28:58,639
They lived by the
badge, they died by the badge.

459
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:03,526
Oh my god, that brings back memories.

460
00:29:03,527 --> 00:29:04,777
Oh thank you.

461
00:29:05,686 --> 00:29:07,405
Hey can I buy you a real drink?

462
00:29:07,406 --> 00:29:08,694
Thank you, but we should probably wait

463
00:29:08,695 --> 00:29:10,695
until my wife gets here.

464
00:29:11,849 --> 00:29:12,979
How long you been married?

465
00:29:12,980 --> 00:29:16,037
12 wonderful years, today.

466
00:29:16,038 --> 00:29:17,109
Congratulations.

467
00:29:17,110 --> 00:29:18,110
Thanks.

468
00:29:22,409 --> 00:29:23,409
The Six.

469
00:29:25,384 --> 00:29:28,445
Whatever happened to the guy
who played Sergeant Richards?

470
00:29:28,446 --> 00:29:30,020
The grumpy one who walked with a limp.

471
00:29:30,021 --> 00:29:32,086
Yeah, Deacon Smith.

472
00:29:32,087 --> 00:29:35,670
God rest him, he passed
about 10 years ago.

473
00:29:37,592 --> 00:29:38,504
I'm sorry to hear that.

474
00:29:38,505 --> 00:29:39,917
Heck of an actor.

475
00:29:39,918 --> 00:29:42,146
That was a real limp too.

476
00:29:42,147 --> 00:29:44,453
I didn't know that.

477
00:29:44,454 --> 00:29:47,353
What about the guy who
played your partner?

478
00:29:47,354 --> 00:29:49,469
Um, oh Tom McBride.

479
00:29:49,470 --> 00:29:51,750
You don't see much of him any more.

480
00:29:51,751 --> 00:29:56,334
Yeah, well ah, sadly Tom
is no longer with us either.

481
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:01,882
Wow, I am really striking out here.

482
00:30:03,688 --> 00:30:05,059
Glad you're still with us.

483
00:30:10,337 --> 00:30:12,670
I'm guessing she's with you.

484
00:30:14,473 --> 00:30:15,967
Harold, it's wonderful meeting you.

485
00:30:15,968 --> 00:30:17,354
Take care, Mr. Forester.

486
00:30:17,355 --> 00:30:18,460
Happy anniversary.

487
00:30:18,461 --> 00:30:19,461
Thanks.

488
00:30:21,734 --> 00:30:24,511
Edward, it's so good to see you.

489
00:30:24,512 --> 00:30:25,841
Thanks for meeting me here.

490
00:30:25,842 --> 00:30:27,842
Yeah, I kinda like it.

491
00:30:33,572 --> 00:30:34,911
It was such a nice surprise

492
00:30:34,912 --> 00:30:36,471
to bump into you the other day

493
00:30:36,472 --> 00:30:39,562
and an even nicer one to get your call.

494
00:30:39,563 --> 00:30:40,863
How is your mom?

495
00:30:40,864 --> 00:30:43,550
Still running marathons
if that tells you anything.

496
00:30:43,551 --> 00:30:44,810
Well good for her.

497
00:30:44,811 --> 00:30:48,249
She was excited to hear
that we were getting together.

498
00:30:48,250 --> 00:30:49,458
What would you like?

499
00:30:49,459 --> 00:30:51,737
Whatever you're having will be fine.

500
00:30:51,738 --> 00:30:53,405
Two camps, please.

501
00:30:54,690 --> 00:30:57,038
I can't remember the
last time I saw you.

502
00:30:57,039 --> 00:30:59,844
I figured you were back
doing Broadway again.

503
00:30:59,845 --> 00:31:02,489
No, I was out of the
country for a while.

504
00:31:02,490 --> 00:31:04,568
Ah, that lovely Italian broad

505
00:31:04,569 --> 00:31:07,314
with an ass like a nectarine.

506
00:31:07,315 --> 00:31:09,336
Is that all you remember about her?

507
00:31:09,337 --> 00:31:11,276
And that she was rather tall.

508
00:31:11,277 --> 00:31:12,917
I hate women like that.

509
00:31:12,918 --> 00:31:14,757
Nah, we're done.

510
00:31:14,758 --> 00:31:17,106
Conscious uncoupling, I
think they call it now.

511
00:31:17,107 --> 00:31:20,107
So as not to offend the other party.

512
00:31:21,207 --> 00:31:23,821
So are you seeing anyone special?

513
00:31:23,822 --> 00:31:24,989
No.

514
00:31:26,135 --> 00:31:27,302
Go ahead.

515
00:31:27,303 --> 00:31:28,136
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

516
00:31:28,137 --> 00:31:29,210
Oh thanks.

517
00:31:29,211 --> 00:31:30,878
It'll just be a sec.

518
00:31:37,711 --> 00:31:38,711
Thank you.

519
00:31:42,819 --> 00:31:44,727
To your success.

520
00:31:44,728 --> 00:31:45,728
And yours.

521
00:31:49,437 --> 00:31:50,646
So what's next for you?

522
00:31:50,647 --> 00:31:52,845
Have any exciting projects on the horizon?

523
00:31:52,846 --> 00:31:56,784
- Well, there's this one...
- I'm so sorry.

524
00:31:56,785 --> 00:31:59,362
Let me just respond and
then I'll turn it off.

525
00:31:59,363 --> 00:32:01,807
Well, you're a busy girl.

526
00:32:01,808 --> 00:32:03,141
It's my agent.

527
00:32:04,004 --> 00:32:06,292
There's a film they want me for,

528
00:32:06,293 --> 00:32:09,522
but it totally conflicts with my schedule.

529
00:32:09,523 --> 00:32:11,440
I am so over that show.

530
00:32:12,357 --> 00:32:15,940
I really wanna make
the jump to big screen.

531
00:32:17,565 --> 00:32:20,024
There, I'm all yours.

532
00:32:20,025 --> 00:32:21,931
Well, there is this film
I've been approached on

533
00:32:21,932 --> 00:32:25,017
and I should know more next week.

534
00:32:25,018 --> 00:32:27,935
Well they'd be lucky to have you.

535
00:32:30,513 --> 00:32:31,513
So?

536
00:32:33,734 --> 00:32:34,734
So?

537
00:32:35,646 --> 00:32:37,497
Well you didn't wanna get together

538
00:32:37,498 --> 00:32:39,831
to discuss showbiz, did you?

539
00:32:41,050 --> 00:32:43,597
You know I'm not the innocent young thing

540
00:32:43,598 --> 00:32:46,208
that you remember when we first met.

541
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:48,747
And if you don't hurry
up and make your move,

542
00:32:48,748 --> 00:32:51,958
I'm just gonna have to
get started without you.

543
00:32:51,959 --> 00:32:54,635
Whoa, Rebecca, I'm flattered really,

544
00:32:54,636 --> 00:32:58,457
but ah, oh you caught me by surprise here.

545
00:32:58,458 --> 00:33:00,934
Oh baby, I am so sorry.

546
00:33:00,935 --> 00:33:04,997
Do you have a little
blue pill you could take?

547
00:33:04,998 --> 00:33:07,621
That is not the problem.

548
00:33:07,622 --> 00:33:08,622
What?

549
00:33:10,306 --> 00:33:12,622
My agency let me go last week

550
00:33:12,623 --> 00:33:16,040
and quite frankly, I need representation.

551
00:33:17,543 --> 00:33:19,771
You're joking, right?

552
00:33:19,772 --> 00:33:21,551
Unfortunately no,

553
00:33:21,552 --> 00:33:23,840
and when I saw you the
other day, I thought...

554
00:33:23,841 --> 00:33:27,170
Hey, maybe Rebecca can help.

555
00:33:27,171 --> 00:33:29,792
Rebecca, I apologize if I
gave you the wrong impression,

556
00:33:29,793 --> 00:33:34,462
but really this is just a
friend reaching out for help.

557
00:33:34,463 --> 00:33:36,950
Much like I did for you
to jumpstart your career.

558
00:33:36,951 --> 00:33:39,182
And I had to jump a
lot of people, Edward

559
00:33:39,183 --> 00:33:41,947
to get to where I am with my success.

560
00:33:41,948 --> 00:33:42,859
I understand.

561
00:33:42,860 --> 00:33:45,788
Right now, I need someone in my corner.

562
00:33:45,789 --> 00:33:47,660
Someone to go to bat for
me and remind Hollywood

563
00:33:47,661 --> 00:33:49,197
that I'm ready to go back to work.

564
00:33:49,198 --> 00:33:50,927
What do you want me to do?

565
00:33:50,928 --> 00:33:52,894
At the very least, ask your agent

566
00:33:52,895 --> 00:33:54,548
to take a meeting with me.

567
00:33:54,549 --> 00:33:57,235
That's where it gets complicated.

568
00:33:57,236 --> 00:34:00,089
He knows you and I have
a long history together

569
00:34:00,090 --> 00:34:02,423
and well, you know, awkward.

570
00:34:03,436 --> 00:34:05,070
I am really sorry.

571
00:34:05,071 --> 00:34:07,973
My god, Edward, I grew up a fan

572
00:34:07,974 --> 00:34:10,598
and I had the privilege
of getting to know you.

573
00:34:10,599 --> 00:34:14,547
I mean really know you
and I like that man.

574
00:34:14,548 --> 00:34:16,381
This one, not so much.

575
00:34:17,967 --> 00:34:20,897
Do you know how
traumatized I am right now?

576
00:34:20,898 --> 00:34:23,344
Where did I see my Zantacs.

577
00:34:23,345 --> 00:34:24,345
I gotta go.

578
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,623
You're home early.

579
00:34:37,260 --> 00:34:38,260
Yes, I am.

580
00:34:39,411 --> 00:34:40,632
Have a good evening.

581
00:34:40,633 --> 00:34:42,042
Come on.

582
00:34:42,043 --> 00:34:45,375
I'm over here watching cartoons.

583
00:34:45,376 --> 00:34:47,468
How was your date?

584
00:34:47,469 --> 00:34:51,337
I reached out to a
friend and it backfired.

585
00:34:51,338 --> 00:34:52,796
Was it a woman?

586
00:34:52,797 --> 00:34:54,329
It happened to be, yes.

587
00:34:54,330 --> 00:34:56,064
Want me to kick her ass?

588
00:34:56,065 --> 00:34:57,065
Yes.

589
00:34:58,484 --> 00:34:59,563
What's your name?

590
00:34:59,564 --> 00:35:01,200
Catarina.

591
00:35:01,201 --> 00:35:02,541
It's a beautiful name.

592
00:35:02,542 --> 00:35:04,040
I'm Edward Forester.

593
00:35:04,041 --> 00:35:05,553
You retired?

594
00:35:05,554 --> 00:35:07,321
I look old enough to be retired?

595
00:35:07,322 --> 00:35:08,739
No, I'm an actor.

596
00:35:09,980 --> 00:35:12,048
Aren't we all?

597
00:35:12,049 --> 00:35:14,396
This is my little hero, Matthew.

598
00:35:14,397 --> 00:35:16,918
Matthew, this is Mr. Forester.

599
00:35:16,919 --> 00:35:18,836
Hey Matthew.

600
00:35:20,707 --> 00:35:23,897
Catarina, I think I misjudged you.

601
00:35:23,898 --> 00:35:27,530
No getting all
sentimental on me, Forester.

602
00:35:27,531 --> 00:35:32,531
I gotta enough flies to swat.

603
00:35:43,985 --> 00:35:45,052
Hi, this is Edward.

604
00:35:45,053 --> 00:35:47,641
Hi Edward, it's Bethany,
how you doing today?

605
00:35:47,642 --> 00:35:48,893
Doing fine.

606
00:35:48,894 --> 00:35:51,045
I think I'm getting near
the end of unpacking things

607
00:35:51,046 --> 00:35:52,621
I haven't used in 20 years.

608
00:35:52,622 --> 00:35:53,711
- What's up?
- Get my attorney

609
00:35:53,712 --> 00:35:55,465
on the phone.

610
00:35:55,466 --> 00:35:57,216
I'll call you back.

611
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:01,129
Is everything all right?

612
00:36:01,130 --> 00:36:02,577
Does everything look
as though it's all right?

613
00:36:02,578 --> 00:36:03,565
What happened?

614
00:36:03,566 --> 00:36:06,692
Candy got arrested in
some Miami nightclub.

615
00:36:06,693 --> 00:36:08,683
She told me she was 21.

616
00:36:08,684 --> 00:36:09,912
You heard her, right?

617
00:36:09,913 --> 00:36:10,805
I, oh...

618
00:36:10,806 --> 00:36:13,252
She's 17 years old.

619
00:36:13,253 --> 00:36:14,711
- Oops.
- Yeah.

620
00:36:14,712 --> 00:36:16,338
Little bitch lied to me.

621
00:36:16,339 --> 00:36:18,025
Can you believe it?

622
00:36:18,026 --> 00:36:19,494
I'll call your attorney.

623
00:36:19,495 --> 00:36:20,495
All right.

624
00:36:26,322 --> 00:36:27,943
Hmm.

625
00:36:27,944 --> 00:36:28,843
Hi Bethany.

626
00:36:28,844 --> 00:36:30,189
Sorry about that.

627
00:36:30,190 --> 00:36:32,022
I heard Adam, is he okay?

628
00:36:32,023 --> 00:36:34,718
Yeah, nothing new under the sun.

629
00:36:34,719 --> 00:36:37,038
Look, I wanted to tell you
I still haven't locked down

630
00:36:37,039 --> 00:36:38,677
your meeting with Aaron Michaels.

631
00:36:38,678 --> 00:36:41,885
He's still, shall we say, on the lam.

632
00:36:41,886 --> 00:36:43,727
Bethany, I appreciate your help.

633
00:36:43,728 --> 00:36:44,811
I'll standby.

634
00:36:46,017 --> 00:36:47,350
- Edward?
- Yeah.

635
00:36:48,330 --> 00:36:50,322
It'll all work out.

636
00:36:50,323 --> 00:36:51,323
Thank you.

637
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,935
- Hello?
- Jeremy, hi, Edward Forester.

638
00:37:05,936 --> 00:37:07,292
Wow, hello.

639
00:37:07,293 --> 00:37:08,126
How are you, sir?

640
00:37:08,127 --> 00:37:10,101
I'm good, listen, I
just wanted to tell you

641
00:37:10,102 --> 00:37:12,589
that I'm still in the
process of changing agents,

642
00:37:12,590 --> 00:37:15,868
so it may be a couple of days
before you hear anything.

643
00:37:15,869 --> 00:37:17,739
Okay, understandable.

644
00:37:17,740 --> 00:37:19,230
Thanks for letting me know.

645
00:37:19,231 --> 00:37:20,831
Just didn't want you to think once again

646
00:37:20,832 --> 00:37:24,060
that your project was going unattended to.

647
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:25,574
I appreciate that.

648
00:37:25,575 --> 00:37:28,066
I'll tell everybody you called.

649
00:37:45,874 --> 00:37:47,049
Are the melons ripe?

650
00:37:47,050 --> 00:37:49,050
Oh yes, ma'am.

651
00:37:50,553 --> 00:37:52,417
Hello Lydia.

652
00:37:52,418 --> 00:37:53,418
How are you?

653
00:37:54,266 --> 00:37:56,943
I thought you hated asparagus.

654
00:37:56,944 --> 00:38:00,792
Well times and people
have been known to change.

655
00:38:00,793 --> 00:38:02,043
Have you now?

656
00:38:05,022 --> 00:38:06,311
Nice seeing you, Lydia.

657
00:38:06,312 --> 00:38:08,574
Aw, don't be a dick, Edward.

658
00:38:08,575 --> 00:38:09,408
Oh.

659
00:38:09,409 --> 00:38:12,072
It's okay, I got her.

660
00:38:13,313 --> 00:38:14,980
What's, hi Edward.

661
00:38:32,405 --> 00:38:33,912
I haven't seen your name in the trade

662
00:38:33,913 --> 00:38:37,413
since you bitch slapped Walt's boy genius.

663
00:38:40,531 --> 00:38:43,408
When did you get back anyway?

664
00:38:43,409 --> 00:38:44,909
Four months ago.

665
00:38:46,049 --> 00:38:47,949
You never hit me.

666
00:38:47,950 --> 00:38:51,061
Probably still be married if you did.

667
00:38:51,062 --> 00:38:54,229
Well you knew your craft, he didn't.

668
00:38:56,300 --> 00:39:00,311
Your profession's no
more faithful than I was.

669
00:39:29,918 --> 00:39:30,838
To lock your car.

670
00:39:30,839 --> 00:39:33,965
You can take a cab back
in the morning, okay?

671
00:39:33,966 --> 00:39:36,876
I'm not suppose to drive.

672
00:39:36,877 --> 00:39:38,744
I fell off my horse last summer

673
00:39:38,745 --> 00:39:40,578
and got hooked on Oxi.

674
00:39:41,476 --> 00:39:43,296
It's magical.

675
00:39:43,297 --> 00:39:45,714
Takes away all kinds of pain.

676
00:40:03,654 --> 00:40:05,071
One for the road?

677
00:40:06,562 --> 00:40:07,645
No, thanks.

678
00:40:08,832 --> 00:40:12,249
Walter stays at his hideaway in Malibu.

679
00:40:13,191 --> 00:40:14,341
You're his wife.

680
00:40:14,342 --> 00:40:15,675
I'm his beard.

681
00:40:17,587 --> 00:40:20,504
Turned out we have similar desires.

682
00:40:22,364 --> 00:40:26,281
And when the sex is not
right, nothing's right.

683
00:40:27,628 --> 00:40:30,527
Is that what happened to us?

684
00:40:30,528 --> 00:40:34,695
You were the best lay
this side of the Atlantic.

685
00:40:38,769 --> 00:40:41,102
And I'll be you proved it.

686
00:40:42,166 --> 00:40:43,666
Ouch, that hurt.

687
00:40:44,915 --> 00:40:46,082
It sure did.

688
00:40:57,353 --> 00:40:58,853

Mr. Edward Forester?

708
00:43:11,124 --> 00:43:12,501
Aaron Michaels, pleasure to meet you.

709
00:43:12,502 --> 00:43:13,335
Thank you.

710
00:43:13,336 --> 00:43:14,521
That's my assistant, Jeff.

711
00:43:14,522 --> 00:43:16,132
- Hey Jeff.
- Pleasure.

712
00:43:16,133 --> 00:43:17,133
Shall we?

713
00:43:20,693 --> 00:43:22,495
How was your vacation?

714
00:43:22,496 --> 00:43:26,489
My mother was diagnosed with
advanced pancreatic cancer.

715
00:43:26,490 --> 00:43:28,486
Jeff did his best to bob
and weave while I was out

716
00:43:28,487 --> 00:43:30,320
so I can care for her.

717
00:43:31,567 --> 00:43:33,231
She just passed.

718
00:43:33,232 --> 00:43:35,497
Oh I'm so sorry, Aaron, truly.

719
00:43:35,498 --> 00:43:37,081
My mom was a huge fan.

720
00:43:37,082 --> 00:43:38,847
I told her you were coming in,

721
00:43:38,848 --> 00:43:41,493
she said, wow, my son finally made it.

722
00:43:41,494 --> 00:43:43,226
That's very kind.

723
00:43:43,227 --> 00:43:45,098
Okay, let's talk strategy.

724
00:43:45,099 --> 00:43:46,788
Now I'm sure you're aware opportunities

725
00:43:46,789 --> 00:43:49,199
become less and less the older you get.

726
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,900
Don't misunderstand, you look good.

727
00:43:50,901 --> 00:43:52,852
It's obvious that you
take care of yourself,

728
00:43:52,853 --> 00:43:53,797
but it's gonna be about us

729
00:43:53,798 --> 00:43:57,001
getting you some pivotle
roles, rebranding your image.

730
00:43:57,002 --> 00:43:59,129
So cameos is the diplomat.

731
00:43:59,130 --> 00:44:00,111
Senator.

732
00:44:00,112 --> 00:44:01,881
Father of the 40 year old virgin bride

733
00:44:01,882 --> 00:44:05,018
are gonna become more and more important.

734
00:44:05,019 --> 00:44:05,852
All right.

735
00:44:05,853 --> 00:44:07,247
My mother said if I'm lucky enough

736
00:44:07,248 --> 00:44:11,828
to get Edward Forester as a
client, don't drop the ball.

737
00:44:11,829 --> 00:44:13,321
I promised her I wouldn't.

738
00:44:13,322 --> 00:44:15,750
You sign on with Triad,
you'll be our priority

739
00:44:15,751 --> 00:44:18,314
and we will kick some
serious ass together.

740
00:44:18,315 --> 00:44:19,315
Sleep on it.

741
00:44:20,511 --> 00:44:23,045
Call me whenever you make a decision.

742
00:44:23,046 --> 00:44:25,384
You didn't mention
that tabloid incident.

743
00:44:25,385 --> 00:44:28,717
You smacked some rude,
arrogant, smart ass little punk.

744
00:44:28,718 --> 00:44:30,023
You should've knocked him out.

745
00:44:33,320 --> 00:44:35,571
Let's go kick some serious ass.

746
00:44:35,572 --> 00:44:36,754
All right.

747
00:44:36,755 --> 00:44:37,934
I'll get the contracts together

748
00:44:37,935 --> 00:44:39,000
and schedule for next week.

749
00:44:39,001 --> 00:44:40,219
Thank you, Jeff.

750
00:44:40,220 --> 00:44:43,241
Aaron, could you take
a look at this for me?

751
00:44:43,242 --> 00:44:44,075
Sure.

752
00:44:44,076 --> 00:44:45,736
I'll give it a read this week.

753
00:44:45,737 --> 00:44:48,556
I need you to read that.

754
00:44:48,557 --> 00:44:52,599
I will.

755
00:44:56,679 --> 00:44:57,749
You around today, Forester

756
00:44:57,750 --> 00:45:00,792
or do you have another engagement?

757
00:45:00,793 --> 00:45:01,626
What do you need?

758
00:45:01,627 --> 00:45:03,950
Well, I got another
job that suddenly came up

759
00:45:03,951 --> 00:45:06,128
and Matthew's usually in daycare,

760
00:45:06,129 --> 00:45:09,077
but can you just keep an
eye on him for me today?

761
00:45:09,078 --> 00:45:10,017
Just a couple of hours.

762
00:45:10,018 --> 00:45:11,168
Uh.

763
00:45:11,169 --> 00:45:12,146
Please, please, please.

764
00:45:12,147 --> 00:45:13,465
I'm mean we'll call it even

765
00:45:13,466 --> 00:45:15,886
for the little peep show I gave you, huh?

766
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:18,806
And payback for the laundry.

767
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:20,425
Sure, bring him over.

768
00:45:20,426 --> 00:45:21,317
Oh.

769
00:45:21,318 --> 00:45:24,534
He's been fed and watered
and he has a brand new DVD.

770
00:45:24,535 --> 00:45:27,285
So you won't even know he's here.

771
00:45:28,951 --> 00:45:29,922
You should give me your number,

772
00:45:29,923 --> 00:45:31,584
just in case of emergencies.

773
00:45:31,585 --> 00:45:33,918
Okay, drop in your digits.

774
00:45:35,265 --> 00:45:37,922
What's your number?
Uh, 5557641.

775
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:39,230
Two, one, three, three, one, oh?

776
00:45:39,231 --> 00:45:41,355
Three, one, oh.

777
00:45:41,356 --> 00:45:42,314
Okay.

778
00:45:42,315 --> 00:45:45,103
Excuse me, I need to get that.

779
00:45:45,104 --> 00:45:47,516
Forester, that is me calling you

780
00:45:47,517 --> 00:45:49,491
so you have my phone number, right, right,

781
00:45:49,492 --> 00:45:51,694
right, right, okay.

782
00:45:51,695 --> 00:45:53,278
Okay, I have to go.

783
00:45:54,415 --> 00:45:56,998
I love you my little hero, hmm.

784
00:45:58,634 --> 00:46:00,644
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey.

785
00:46:00,645 --> 00:46:02,525
You're gonna stay with me, okay?

786
00:46:02,526 --> 00:46:03,526
Bye.

787
00:46:04,593 --> 00:46:07,742
Why don't you help me
find my DVD player, huh?

788
00:46:07,743 --> 00:46:08,692
Wanna do that?

789
00:46:08,693 --> 00:46:10,661
Come on, it's in a box somewhere.

790
00:46:22,741 --> 00:46:24,990
Ain't you got anything
more productive to do

791
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:26,701
than to stare at keister all day?

792
00:46:28,572 --> 00:46:30,650
I just wanna make sure
she doesn't scratch the car,

793
00:46:30,651 --> 00:46:32,440
that's all, Roxy.

794
00:46:32,441 --> 00:46:34,057
And I was thinking about fixing up

795
00:46:34,058 --> 00:46:35,702
and keeping the silver bullet.

796
00:46:35,703 --> 00:46:36,792
That car is mean.

797
00:46:36,793 --> 00:46:38,053
There is no way I'm letting you drive

798
00:46:38,054 --> 00:46:38,902
that car around town.

799
00:46:38,903 --> 00:46:39,954
Well you have no say.

800
00:46:39,955 --> 00:46:41,112
- It's...
- Well I do have a say,

801
00:46:41,113 --> 00:46:42,696
are you kidding me?

802
00:46:45,572 --> 00:46:47,712
Nice job on the car, sugar.

803
00:46:47,713 --> 00:46:48,546
Gracias.

804
00:46:48,547 --> 00:46:51,603
Yeah, nice job painting, sugar.

805
00:46:51,604 --> 00:46:53,461
Don't call me sugar.

806
00:46:53,462 --> 00:46:56,064
Only my friends call me sugar.

807
00:46:56,065 --> 00:46:58,315
Well we could be friends.

808
00:47:00,894 --> 00:47:02,704
Don't be a pig.

809
00:47:02,705 --> 00:47:03,788
Pay the girl.

810
00:47:16,962 --> 00:47:18,295
250, two, 250?

811
00:47:19,676 --> 00:47:21,790
Hundred bucks for the
front window, right?

812
00:47:21,791 --> 00:47:24,533
10 bucks a car, there's 15 cars out there.

813
00:47:24,534 --> 00:47:26,117
Do the math, sugar.

814
00:47:27,163 --> 00:47:28,996
Don't call me sugar.

815
00:47:29,922 --> 00:47:30,922
Pay her three.

816
00:47:37,005 --> 00:47:38,384
What, what did she say?

817
00:47:38,385 --> 00:47:39,882
What did she say?

818
00:47:39,883 --> 00:47:41,390
I should charge him 400.

819
00:47:41,391 --> 00:47:42,474
Oh minimum.

820
00:47:56,021 --> 00:47:59,604
Feel like I'm being
hustled here, ladies.

821
00:48:06,195 --> 00:48:09,231
Somebody help me get out of this tower.

822
00:48:15,043 --> 00:48:16,460
This is Edward.

823
00:48:17,524 --> 00:48:18,941
Hey, how are you?

824
00:48:20,863 --> 00:48:22,041
Sure, can you give me an hour?

825
00:48:22,042 --> 00:48:23,031
Let down your hair.

826
00:48:23,032 --> 00:48:25,321
Great, I'll be there.

827
00:48:25,322 --> 00:48:27,155
Yes, of course.

828
00:48:31,358 --> 00:48:32,760
Catarina, it's Edward.

829
00:48:32,761 --> 00:48:33,761
All is well.

830
00:48:34,670 --> 00:48:36,736
I've got a meeting across town.

831
00:48:36,737 --> 00:48:38,237
Matthew's with me.

832
00:48:40,080 --> 00:48:44,449
Matthew, how would you
like to go for a ride?

833
00:48:44,450 --> 00:48:47,159

Ready for some more driving?

Slow, not fast.

No reckless driving, okay?

00:50:02,546 --> 00:50:04,054
All set.

862
00:50:04,055 --> 00:50:05,753
Here's your monkey.

863
00:50:05,754 --> 00:50:06,754
Here we go.

864
00:50:20,263 --> 00:50:21,673
Good afternoon, Mr. Forester.

865
00:50:21,674 --> 00:50:23,755
Thanks for meeting on such short notice.

866
00:50:23,756 --> 00:50:26,842
This is Matthew, my co-pilot.

867
00:50:26,843 --> 00:50:27,962
Hey Matthew.

868
00:50:27,963 --> 00:50:29,511
- Hi.
- Hey.

869
00:50:29,512 --> 00:50:31,402
Can I get you started
with something to drink?

870
00:50:31,403 --> 00:50:32,772
Uh, nothing just yet.

871
00:50:32,773 --> 00:50:33,773
Oh wait.

872
00:50:34,551 --> 00:50:37,934
How 'bout a hot fudge sundae, sound good?

873
00:50:37,935 --> 00:50:39,293
Hot fudge sundae it is.

874
00:50:39,294 --> 00:50:40,775
Coming right up.

875
00:50:40,776 --> 00:50:44,610
Oh can we get a
booster seat too, please?

876
00:50:44,611 --> 00:50:49,364
Jeremy, great script, I never
laughed so hard in my life.

877
00:50:49,365 --> 00:50:50,892
Thank you.

878
00:50:50,893 --> 00:50:52,270
You're welcome.

879
00:50:52,271 --> 00:50:53,760
You know and it wasn't just the humor.

880
00:50:53,761 --> 00:50:56,099
It was the heart of the whole story.

881
00:50:56,100 --> 00:50:57,725
I mean you did such a great job

882
00:50:57,726 --> 00:51:02,060
establishing the character,
his needs, his dynamics.

883
00:51:02,061 --> 00:51:04,639
You know I've done over 40 films, right?

884
00:51:04,640 --> 00:51:06,631
I just hope you know that,

885
00:51:06,632 --> 00:51:09,985
well how special this one is to me.

886
00:51:09,986 --> 00:51:12,986
Mr. Forester, may I speak frankly?

887
00:51:14,024 --> 00:51:15,274
By all means.

888
00:51:17,005 --> 00:51:19,054
The production company
has hired somebody else

889
00:51:19,055 --> 00:51:20,555
to play your part.

890
00:51:22,034 --> 00:51:25,451
I'm sorry.

891
00:51:26,941 --> 00:51:27,952
What happened?

892
00:51:27,953 --> 00:51:28,915
The money people decided

893
00:51:28,916 --> 00:51:31,184
they wanted somebody else in the role.

894
00:51:31,185 --> 00:51:34,518
I learned that just before I called you.

895
00:51:36,372 --> 00:51:38,539
Here you go, sweetheart.

896
00:51:39,718 --> 00:51:40,697
Two extra spoons.

897
00:51:40,697 --> 00:51:41,538
Thank you.

898
00:51:41,539 --> 00:51:44,107
You're welcome.

899
00:51:44,108 --> 00:51:46,047
I was assured you could play the role

900
00:51:46,048 --> 00:51:48,275
of Reginald T. Blauvelt the 3rd

901
00:51:48,276 --> 00:51:50,300
or I wouldn't have offered it to you.

902
00:51:50,301 --> 00:51:52,978
They didn't keep their word.

903
00:51:52,979 --> 00:51:54,412
Imagine that.

904
00:51:54,413 --> 00:51:57,871
I trust the value of a handshake.

905
00:51:57,872 --> 00:51:59,793
That's how I was raised on our farm.

906
00:51:59,794 --> 00:52:01,711
Your word is your bond.

907
00:52:03,299 --> 00:52:07,423
I was warned something
like this might happen.

908
00:52:07,424 --> 00:52:10,341
I really thought it'd be different.

909
00:52:13,233 --> 00:52:15,794
I don't know what else to say.

910
00:52:15,795 --> 00:52:16,657
I don't get it.

911
00:52:16,658 --> 00:52:17,907
It's all right.

912
00:52:20,335 --> 00:52:23,252
Thank you for telling me in person.

913
00:52:27,114 --> 00:52:28,781
Have some ice cream.

914
00:52:40,723 --> 00:52:41,723
There's mommy.

915
00:52:47,027 --> 00:52:48,380
Hi.

916
00:52:48,381 --> 00:52:49,470
Everybody survive the day?

917
00:52:49,471 --> 00:52:51,088
He's no problems.

918
00:52:51,089 --> 00:52:53,185
No, we had fun, huh Matthew?

919
00:52:53,186 --> 00:52:55,603
Get your shoes, sweetheart.

920
00:52:57,900 --> 00:53:00,317
- Thank you.
- Oh wait a second.

921
00:53:05,768 --> 00:53:07,458
What is this?

922
00:53:07,459 --> 00:53:08,366
It's for your co-pilot.

923
00:53:08,367 --> 00:53:09,466
I already have one in my car.

924
00:53:09,467 --> 00:53:11,166
Wait, it's a gift.

925
00:53:11,167 --> 00:53:12,918
No, I only need one.

926
00:53:12,919 --> 00:53:16,752
When he drives you can
sit in the other one.

927
00:53:19,705 --> 00:53:20,892
Thank you.

928
00:53:20,893 --> 00:53:22,143
Bye, Matthew.

929
00:53:46,648 --> 00:53:49,815
Sign and initial both pages, please.

930
00:53:52,095 --> 00:53:53,251
All right, I'll get these copied

931
00:53:53,252 --> 00:53:55,169
and be back in a flash.

932
00:53:57,870 --> 00:53:59,573
So look, I loved the script.

933
00:53:59,574 --> 00:54:01,595
What's your involvement?

934
00:54:01,596 --> 00:54:03,534
Well I was gonna play one of the leads,

935
00:54:03,535 --> 00:54:06,020
but I just found out I've been replaced.

936
00:54:06,021 --> 00:54:07,671
Replaced?

937
00:54:07,672 --> 00:54:09,383
Well I called down to Cutting Edge.

938
00:54:09,384 --> 00:54:10,780
They dropped it.

939
00:54:10,781 --> 00:54:11,727
Sorry.

940
00:54:11,728 --> 00:54:14,264
So onward and I've already
got some interest in you,

941
00:54:14,265 --> 00:54:16,184
but I need some new head shots.

942
00:54:16,185 --> 00:54:19,210
Now I need one formal in a tux,

943
00:54:19,211 --> 00:54:22,224
one in casual attire,
one is a judicial robe,

944
00:54:22,225 --> 00:54:25,675
if you can get it, and
one wearing a sundress

945
00:54:25,676 --> 00:54:27,613
holding a great big rainbow lollipop,

946
00:54:27,614 --> 00:54:30,289
Edward, you're not listening
to a word I'm saying.

947
00:54:30,290 --> 00:54:31,294
What would it take to get the rights

948
00:54:31,295 --> 00:54:33,124
to that project?

949
00:54:33,125 --> 00:54:34,582
Best Medicine?

950
00:54:34,583 --> 00:54:37,363
Edward, it's done,
finished, kiss it goodbye.

951
00:54:37,364 --> 00:54:38,400
Could you give us one second?

952
00:54:38,401 --> 00:54:39,234
Yeah sure.

953
00:54:39,235 --> 00:54:41,887
This film has gotta get made.

954
00:54:41,888 --> 00:54:43,626
I already told you, I love the script.

955
00:54:43,627 --> 00:54:46,564
And I respect your passion.

956
00:54:46,565 --> 00:54:47,832
What's your play here?

957
00:54:47,833 --> 00:54:49,265
I don't know.

958
00:54:49,266 --> 00:54:51,375
I've never done this
before, where do I start?

959
00:54:51,376 --> 00:54:53,023
Well traditionally
if you want the rights,

960
00:54:53,024 --> 00:54:54,686
they cost money.

961
00:54:54,687 --> 00:54:55,687
How much?

962
00:54:59,124 --> 00:55:01,040
Hello Jeff, find out from Cutting Edge

963
00:55:01,041 --> 00:55:05,675
what'll take to get the
rights to Best Medicine.

964
00:55:05,676 --> 00:55:07,653
So now you wanna be a producer.

965
00:55:07,654 --> 00:55:08,654
I get it.

966
00:55:09,724 --> 00:55:11,994
All I needed were head shots.

967
00:55:11,995 --> 00:55:13,776
Do you wanna direct too?

968
00:55:13,777 --> 00:55:16,573
No, I just want total creative control.

969
00:55:16,574 --> 00:55:18,440
You plan on funding
the project yourself?

970
00:55:18,441 --> 00:55:21,755
'Cause you'll need to if
you want that kinda juice.

971
00:55:21,756 --> 00:55:23,289
Who do you wanna direct?

972
00:55:23,290 --> 00:55:25,194
The guy who wrote it.

973
00:55:25,195 --> 00:55:26,732
Jeremy Robely?

974
00:55:26,733 --> 00:55:28,593
The guy has zero directing credits.

975
00:55:28,594 --> 00:55:32,233
Getting a cast attached,
it's gonna be tough.

976
00:55:32,234 --> 00:55:36,023
If she's available,
what about Rebecca Leigh?

977
00:55:36,024 --> 00:55:37,807
You could package us, right?

978
00:55:37,808 --> 00:55:38,808
With cast?

979
00:55:39,727 --> 00:55:41,468
I appreciate the vote of confidence here,

980
00:55:41,469 --> 00:55:43,608
but I'm not a packaging agent.

981
00:55:43,609 --> 00:55:46,216
But I know you have your
differences with Adam,

982
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,788
but be smart, swallow
your pride and use him.

983
00:55:51,329 --> 00:55:52,829
Talk to me, goose.

984
00:55:55,353 --> 00:55:57,526
All right, thanks.

985
00:55:57,527 --> 00:55:59,467
It's budgeted at 2 1/2 million.

986
00:55:59,468 --> 00:56:01,358
So far they got 50 grand into it.

987
00:56:01,359 --> 00:56:03,436
It's all yours for 75.

988
00:56:03,437 --> 00:56:04,437
75.

989
00:56:06,056 --> 00:56:07,333
What, thousand?

990
00:56:08,631 --> 00:56:09,631
Yeah.

991
00:56:16,151 --> 00:56:18,398
Can I have a word?

992
00:56:18,399 --> 00:56:21,430
Barbara, why don't
you got into my office?

993
00:56:21,431 --> 00:56:22,884
- Okay.
- You look great.

994
00:56:22,885 --> 00:56:25,084
Thank you.

995
00:56:25,085 --> 00:56:27,002
Mm, I'll be right in.

996
00:56:29,488 --> 00:56:32,106
Samuel, how do I tap into my CD account?

997
00:56:32,107 --> 00:56:36,196
You go to a bank and
you make a withdrawal.

998
00:56:36,197 --> 00:56:37,030
That's it?

999
00:56:37,030 --> 00:56:37,863
How much?

1000
00:56:37,864 --> 00:56:40,532
75 thousand, I'm buying
rights to a screenplay.

1001
00:56:40,533 --> 00:56:44,530
Eddie, I told you that
money is your safety net.

1002
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:46,463
Why don't you just get a free option

1003
00:56:46,464 --> 00:56:48,343
on the script like everybody else?

1004
00:56:48,344 --> 00:56:49,554
The company that owns it

1005
00:56:49,555 --> 00:56:51,318
wants their investment back up front.

1006
00:56:51,319 --> 00:56:53,299
You take that money
out and you are looking

1007
00:56:53,300 --> 00:56:55,598
at severe penalties.

1008
00:56:55,599 --> 00:56:56,627
What kind of penalty?

1009
00:56:56,628 --> 00:56:58,319
You need to talk to your CPA.

1010
00:56:58,320 --> 00:57:00,182
I don't have one.

1011
00:57:00,183 --> 00:57:01,542
Look, when the film is financed...

1012
00:57:01,543 --> 00:57:04,382
If the film is financed.

1013
00:57:04,383 --> 00:57:07,161
Eddie, you know the movie business.

1014
00:57:07,162 --> 00:57:09,102
It's a crap shoot, crap.

1015
00:57:09,103 --> 00:57:09,936
Get it?

1016
00:57:09,937 --> 00:57:11,642
One that you can't afford to take.

1017
00:57:11,643 --> 00:57:14,066
Look I have got to go.

1018
00:57:14,067 --> 00:57:15,317

Wow!

1035
00:59:16,062 --> 00:59:17,906
Did you do this?

1036
00:59:19,272 --> 00:59:23,351
What's with all the noise over there?

1037
00:59:23,352 --> 00:59:26,213
It's not noise, Catarina, it's music.

1038
00:59:26,214 --> 00:59:28,297
I had a very special day.

1039
00:59:29,801 --> 00:59:32,954
Hey why don't you guys join
me for dinner, both of ya.

1040
00:59:32,955 --> 00:59:35,414
Come on, I don't wanna
celebrate by myself.

1041
00:59:43,530 --> 00:59:45,697
You asked for the bueno.

1042
00:59:53,255 --> 00:59:54,755
Catarina, are you coming?

1043
00:59:54,756 --> 00:59:56,427
Yes, I am coming!

1044
00:59:56,428 --> 00:59:59,178
Just be a little patient, please.

1045
01:00:53,021 --> 01:00:54,354
Oh, beautiful.

1046
01:00:55,355 --> 01:00:56,605
Very beautiful.

1047
01:00:59,157 --> 01:01:00,490
Please, come in.

1048
01:01:04,852 --> 01:01:06,581
What's this for?

1049
01:01:06,582 --> 01:01:08,026
What is this for, what
do you mean what is this?

1050
01:01:08,027 --> 01:01:10,832
It's for you, what do you think it's for?

1051
01:01:10,833 --> 01:01:14,406
You make me feel like a
stupid little school girl.

1052
01:01:14,407 --> 01:01:17,036
I'm sorry, it's been a while.

1053
01:01:17,037 --> 01:01:18,968
You understand?

1054
01:01:18,969 --> 01:01:20,219
Yeah, me too.

1055
01:01:21,665 --> 01:01:23,525
May I open it?

1056
01:01:23,526 --> 01:01:24,526
Don't be so dramatic.

1057
01:01:25,496 --> 01:01:26,496
Open it.

1058
01:01:31,097 --> 01:01:33,255
Circle of friends.

1059
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:34,117
That's very nice.

1060
01:01:34,118 --> 01:01:36,964
It was my family's.

1061
01:01:36,965 --> 01:01:37,967
Thank you.

1062
01:01:43,246 --> 01:01:45,182
How long have
you guys lived here?

1063
01:01:45,183 --> 01:01:46,174
Three years.

1064
01:01:46,175 --> 01:01:49,220
We used to live downstairs,
but the people upstairs

1065
01:01:49,221 --> 01:01:51,382
they just made so much noise, you know.

1066
01:01:51,383 --> 01:01:54,280
Boom, boom, boom, all the time.

1067
01:01:54,281 --> 01:01:56,081
Sounds like they really
enjoyed one another.

1068
01:01:57,544 --> 01:01:59,252
They were break dancing.

1069
01:01:59,253 --> 01:02:00,623
Ah break dance, yeah.

1070
01:02:00,624 --> 01:02:01,584
- Wow.
- Break dancing, they were.

1071
01:02:01,585 --> 01:02:06,584
Yes and it made it feel like
an earthquake down here.

1072
01:02:06,830 --> 01:02:08,624
So you're an actor.

1073
01:02:08,625 --> 01:02:10,637
How come you don't work any more?

1074
01:02:10,638 --> 01:02:12,407
I google you.

1075
01:02:12,408 --> 01:02:15,170
Oh, of course you did.

1076
01:02:15,171 --> 01:02:17,015
All right, what did google tell you?

1077
01:02:17,016 --> 01:02:19,105
You like to fight.

1078
01:02:19,106 --> 01:02:20,711
You're like a boxer.

1079
01:02:20,712 --> 01:02:22,318
You like to knock everybody out.

1080
01:02:22,319 --> 01:02:24,457
Oh come on, I didn't knock him out.

1081
01:02:24,458 --> 01:02:27,608
I backhanded some little punk
who was being disrespectful.

1082
01:02:27,609 --> 01:02:32,609
And then you beat up some
newspaper writer in New York.

1083
01:02:32,940 --> 01:02:34,827
Why you gotta go around
hurting people, hmm?

1084
01:02:34,828 --> 01:02:35,958
It wasn't like that.

1085
01:02:35,959 --> 01:02:37,491
I had a lead in a Broadway show

1086
01:02:37,492 --> 01:02:39,329
and some critic really panned me.

1087
01:02:39,330 --> 01:02:41,609
So you had to hit him?

1088
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:43,413
You really want me to relive this?

1089
01:02:43,414 --> 01:02:45,480
Yes, I think I do.

1090
01:02:45,481 --> 01:02:50,481
Okay, uh, he blamed my
bad performance on my wife,

1091
01:02:50,502 --> 01:02:52,982
who he announced publicly
he was having an affair

1092
01:02:52,983 --> 01:02:55,188
back in Los Angeles.

1093
01:02:55,189 --> 01:02:57,572
First I'd heard of it.

1094
01:02:57,573 --> 01:02:59,420
Couple of nights later, I
ran into him and his cronies

1095
01:02:59,421 --> 01:03:02,022
in a popular restaurant.

1096
01:03:02,023 --> 01:03:05,595
I had too much to drink so I
went over and called him out.

1097
01:03:05,596 --> 01:03:10,294
He threw his drink in my
face and I busted his nose.

1098
01:03:10,295 --> 01:03:11,934
Was he right?

1099
01:03:11,935 --> 01:03:14,014
Either way I lost.

1100
01:03:14,015 --> 01:03:14,848
Got fired from the show

1101
01:03:14,849 --> 01:03:17,988
and came home to an empty house in L.A.

1102
01:03:17,989 --> 01:03:21,072
So what were you doing in Karamoja?

1103
01:03:22,906 --> 01:03:25,494
Something for somebody besides myself.

1104
01:03:25,495 --> 01:03:27,004
Come on, Forester, speak English.

1105
01:03:27,005 --> 01:03:28,205
What are you trying to say?

1106
01:03:28,206 --> 01:03:30,897
That I always put my career first.

1107
01:03:30,898 --> 01:03:32,577
Never get away from Hollywood.

1108
01:03:32,578 --> 01:03:35,513
Never go find myself, as the psychs say,

1109
01:03:35,514 --> 01:03:37,788
you know reshuffle my priorities.

1110
01:03:37,789 --> 01:03:40,172
So I booked a flight to Africa

1111
01:03:40,173 --> 01:03:42,761
and ended up in Karamoja, Uganda

1112
01:03:42,762 --> 01:03:45,399
volunteering for a bunch of do-gooders.

1113
01:03:45,400 --> 01:03:48,209
And what kind of good were they doing?

1114
01:03:48,210 --> 01:03:50,889
They make sure that children
in Third World countries

1115
01:03:50,890 --> 01:03:52,973
have a fair shot at life.

1116
01:03:54,908 --> 01:03:59,299
I learned a lot more from
them than they did from me.

1117
01:03:59,300 --> 01:04:00,707
Mission accomplished.

1118
01:04:00,708 --> 01:04:05,236
Fast forward, here I am ready
to get back in the game.

1119
01:04:05,237 --> 01:04:07,070
How I misjudged you.

1120
01:04:14,095 --> 01:04:16,428
Is his father in his life?

1121
01:04:18,597 --> 01:04:19,597
No.

1122
01:04:20,520 --> 01:04:23,279
He's a good kid, why not?

1123
01:04:23,280 --> 01:04:24,437
You know it's getting late.

1124
01:04:24,438 --> 01:04:25,755
I think it's time to go.

1125
01:04:25,756 --> 01:04:26,756
Mateo.

1126
01:04:27,802 --> 01:04:29,135
Get your things.

1127
01:04:30,757 --> 01:04:31,590
Mateo.

1128
01:04:31,591 --> 01:04:35,349
It would be nice
to know something about you.

1129
01:04:35,350 --> 01:04:37,222
You going to take a swing at me now?

1130
01:04:46,594 --> 01:04:48,761
I didn't mean to say that.

1131
01:05:15,707 --> 01:05:16,561
Hi.

1132
01:05:16,562 --> 01:05:17,749
Hi.

1133
01:05:17,750 --> 01:05:19,655
You inquiring about the studio for rent?

1134
01:05:19,656 --> 01:05:23,237
No, actually I was
looking for Jeremy Robely.

1135
01:05:23,238 --> 01:05:25,357
He moved out last week.

1136
01:05:25,358 --> 01:05:27,256
You wouldn't happen
to know where he went?

1137
01:05:27,257 --> 01:05:29,474
Couldn't tell ya, he stayed to himself.

1138
01:05:29,475 --> 01:05:31,474
He was month to month.

1139
01:05:31,475 --> 01:05:33,431
I think I still have phone
number on him though.

1140
01:05:33,432 --> 01:05:35,247
The 8-0-5 number?

1141
01:05:35,248 --> 01:05:36,089
That's the one.

1142
01:05:36,090 --> 01:05:37,491
It's been disconnected.

1143
01:05:37,492 --> 01:05:38,968
But thanks anyway.

1144
01:05:38,969 --> 01:05:40,768
Well good luck.

1145
01:05:40,769 --> 01:05:45,102
Hey if you see him, tell
him he owes a cleaning fee.

1146
01:05:54,116 --> 01:05:56,125
It's good, huh?

1147
01:05:56,126 --> 01:05:57,258
Is it hot?

1148
01:05:57,259 --> 01:05:58,259
Ooh hot.

1149
01:06:01,517 --> 01:06:03,035
This is not my first barbecue.

1150
01:06:03,036 --> 01:06:04,048
Hey, how's it going?

1151
01:06:04,049 --> 01:06:05,049
Hey.

1152
01:06:05,849 --> 01:06:06,849
Jail bait.

1153
01:06:10,229 --> 01:06:12,048
Well, well, well.

1154
01:06:12,049 --> 01:06:13,648
What a nice surprise.

1155
01:06:13,649 --> 01:06:15,238
Edward, how are ya?

1156
01:06:15,239 --> 01:06:16,579
Adam.

1157
01:06:16,580 --> 01:06:19,080
How they hanging my brother?

1158
01:06:21,076 --> 01:06:22,890
So everything okay?

1159
01:06:22,891 --> 01:06:25,110
How are things working out?

1160
01:06:25,111 --> 01:06:26,611
So far, so good.

1161
01:06:29,189 --> 01:06:32,336
Why don't you tell him about it?

1162
01:06:32,337 --> 01:06:34,087
Tell me about what?

1163
01:06:35,658 --> 01:06:38,751
I'm acquiring rights to a screenplay.

1164
01:06:38,752 --> 01:06:39,752
Lucky you.

1165
01:06:40,939 --> 01:06:43,048
You know maybe you heard of it.

1166
01:06:43,049 --> 01:06:44,549
The Best Medicine.

1167
01:06:45,509 --> 01:06:47,850
Doesn't ring a bell.

1168
01:06:47,851 --> 01:06:48,851
Huh.

1169
01:06:50,520 --> 01:06:53,621
Well once I get all the pieces together,

1170
01:06:53,622 --> 01:06:56,402
would you be interested in packaging it?

1171
01:06:56,403 --> 01:06:59,754
Edward, I am touched that you would ask.

1172
01:06:59,755 --> 01:07:04,032
So tell me, is it a
comedy, action, thriller?

1173
01:07:04,033 --> 01:07:04,866
Talk to me.

1174
01:07:04,867 --> 01:07:06,813
Well it starts out as a comedy,

1175
01:07:06,814 --> 01:07:08,752
but it kinda shifts gears in there.

1176
01:07:08,753 --> 01:07:09,753
Hi baby.

1177
01:07:10,522 --> 01:07:12,652
Ella, you're interrupting

1178
01:07:12,653 --> 01:07:15,327
a very important conversation here.

1179
01:07:15,328 --> 01:07:16,696
Go grab a couple of seats.

1180
01:07:16,697 --> 01:07:18,280
I'll be right over.

1181
01:07:19,913 --> 01:07:21,158
Oh and a diet soda.

1182
01:07:21,159 --> 01:07:22,159
No ice.

1183
01:07:25,439 --> 01:07:27,440
So it's a dramedy.

1184
01:07:27,441 --> 01:07:31,331
Yeah, I guess it could
be classified as such.

1185
01:07:31,332 --> 01:07:32,861
What's the budget?

1186
01:07:32,862 --> 01:07:34,098
I haven't gotten that far.

1187
01:07:34,099 --> 01:07:35,517
I just secured the rights.

1188
01:07:35,518 --> 01:07:36,736
Get me the script.

1189
01:07:36,737 --> 01:07:40,243
I'll run up the flagpole, see
if anybody gets a hard on.

1190
01:07:40,244 --> 01:07:41,077
We'll go from there.

1191
01:07:41,078 --> 01:07:42,641
Adam, there's already
a director attached.

1192
01:07:42,642 --> 01:07:43,725
Great, who?

1193
01:07:45,181 --> 01:07:46,359
A Jeremy Robely.

1194
01:07:46,360 --> 01:07:48,861
That's a good choice.

1195
01:07:48,862 --> 01:07:50,195
I love his work.

1196
01:07:51,357 --> 01:07:55,204
All right, gentlemen, well I look forward

1197
01:07:55,205 --> 01:07:57,093
to reading the script.

1198
01:07:57,094 --> 01:07:59,008
But now I have to give
my undivided attention

1199
01:07:59,009 --> 01:08:00,176
to young Ella.

1200
01:08:06,144 --> 01:08:07,416
Yeah.

1201
01:08:07,417 --> 01:08:08,419
I know, I know.

1202
01:08:08,420 --> 01:08:09,420
Yeah.

1203
01:08:16,143 --> 01:08:17,881
Mr. Forester.

1204
01:08:17,882 --> 01:08:19,129
Hi.

1205
01:08:19,130 --> 01:08:20,130
Hi.

1206
01:08:26,045 --> 01:08:29,781
I don't follow, you're gonna
have to spell it out for me.

1207
01:08:29,782 --> 01:08:30,737
Look, we wanna avoid

1208
01:08:30,738 --> 01:08:32,641
whatever internal drama's
going on over there

1209
01:08:32,642 --> 01:08:33,949
and just acquire the project.

1210
01:08:33,950 --> 01:08:35,367
No more, no less.

1211
01:08:36,360 --> 01:08:37,890
Is that it?

1212
01:08:37,891 --> 01:08:38,891
All right.

1213
01:08:40,208 --> 01:08:41,088
We have a problem.

1214
01:08:41,088 --> 01:08:41,921
How so?

1215
01:08:41,922 --> 01:08:44,500
Cutting Edge rejected your check.

1216
01:08:44,501 --> 01:08:46,212
Why is was a Cashier's Check?

1217
01:08:46,213 --> 01:08:48,398
That ain't the problem.

1218
01:08:48,399 --> 01:08:51,109
Someone doesn't want you
owning that property.

1219
01:08:51,110 --> 01:08:52,193
Any idea who?

1220
01:08:53,274 --> 01:08:55,848
- No.
- Any luck with the director?

1221
01:08:55,849 --> 01:08:57,133
Can't find him.

1222
01:08:57,966 --> 01:08:59,026
That's great, okay.

1223
01:08:59,027 --> 01:09:00,125
So let's recap.

1224
01:09:00,126 --> 01:09:01,772
You have no rights to the script,

1225
01:09:01,773 --> 01:09:03,927
your director's MIA,
and your leading lady's

1226
01:09:03,928 --> 01:09:05,530
in the funny farm.

1227
01:09:05,531 --> 01:09:08,223
Sounds like a typical
Hollywood production to me.

1228
01:09:08,224 --> 01:09:09,289
You set a start date yet?

1229
01:09:10,929 --> 01:09:12,459
Get me those head shots I asked for

1230
01:09:12,460 --> 01:09:14,260
and let's move on from
this god forsaken mess.

1231
01:09:14,943 --> 01:09:17,026
Excuse me for a minute.

1232
01:09:27,502 --> 01:09:28,835
Excuse me, miss.

1233
01:09:30,442 --> 01:09:31,761
Hi.

1234
01:09:31,762 --> 01:09:33,002
I didn't think you recognized me.

1235
01:09:33,003 --> 01:09:34,242
Yeah.

1236
01:09:34,243 --> 01:09:35,100
I'm Natasha.

1237
01:09:35,101 --> 01:09:36,464
Yes, Jeremy's friend.

1238
01:09:36,465 --> 01:09:39,242
Nice to meet you, I'm Edward Forester.

1239
01:09:39,243 --> 01:09:41,116
Do you have a new number on him?

1240
01:09:41,117 --> 01:09:42,679
Wish I did.

1241
01:09:42,680 --> 01:09:44,582
He's gone back home to Ventura.

1242
01:09:44,583 --> 01:09:47,028
When he quit, he just upped and left.

1243
01:09:47,029 --> 01:09:48,590
He quit?

1244
01:09:48,591 --> 01:09:50,078
You didn't hear what happened?

1245
01:09:50,079 --> 01:09:51,608
No.

1246
01:09:51,609 --> 01:09:54,036
Your life inspired his script.

1247
01:09:54,037 --> 01:09:55,207
When they wouldn't honor the agreement

1248
01:09:55,208 --> 01:09:57,375
to have you in, he walked.

1249
01:09:58,401 --> 01:10:00,767
Jeremy wouldn't do it without you.

1250
01:10:01,610 --> 01:10:04,267
And I didn't realize.

1251
01:10:04,268 --> 01:10:07,162
Do you know anybody that might
have his contact information?

1252
01:10:07,163 --> 01:10:09,734
We were just getting to know each other.

1253
01:10:09,735 --> 01:10:12,490
Never met anyone so
passionate about their work.

1254
01:10:12,491 --> 01:10:16,045
Oh no, thank you, Natasha,
you've been a great help.

1255
01:10:16,046 --> 01:10:16,897
If you do hear from him,

1256
01:10:16,898 --> 01:10:18,524
would you please have him give me a call?

1257
01:10:18,525 --> 01:10:19,649
Sure.

1258
01:10:19,650 --> 01:10:20,690
Will you do me a favor?

1259
01:10:20,691 --> 01:10:23,941
If you find him, tell Jeremy I said hi.

1260
01:10:24,823 --> 01:10:26,076
I certainly will.

1261
01:10:26,077 --> 01:10:27,540
And I'll make sure he calls you too.

1262
01:10:29,908 --> 01:10:31,158
Mr. Forester.

1263
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:34,644
He loves fishing.

1264
01:10:34,645 --> 01:10:38,228
Thank you.

1265
01:10:44,823 --> 01:10:45,656
Oh well, of course.

1266
01:10:45,656 --> 01:10:46,644
I mean they're only wanting everything

1267
01:10:46,645 --> 01:10:48,815
that's currently going and obviously dates

1268
01:10:48,816 --> 01:10:49,999
are gonna be pushed back.

1269
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:53,510
So that means that they're
gonna be possibly the same.

1270
01:10:58,968 --> 01:10:59,801
Hello.

1271
01:10:59,802 --> 01:11:00,987
What's your husband's involvement

1272
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:03,629
with Cutting Edge Entertainment?

1273
01:11:03,630 --> 01:11:04,879
Edward?

1274
01:11:04,880 --> 01:11:06,365
Yes.

1275
01:11:06,366 --> 01:11:08,762
He's acquiring it, why?

1276
01:11:08,763 --> 01:11:10,710
I'm trying to buy a script they own.

1277
01:11:10,711 --> 01:11:12,509
We had a deal and somebody blocked it.

1278
01:11:12,510 --> 01:11:17,510
Look, I'll
get back to you, okay?

1279
01:11:20,275 --> 01:11:23,373
She was using false documents.

1280
01:11:23,374 --> 01:11:24,529
We can prove it.

1281
01:11:24,530 --> 01:11:28,466
I was the one who booked Candy
in on the movie, remember?

1282
01:11:28,467 --> 01:11:30,282
Frederick, damn it, of course
they wouldn't have hired her

1283
01:11:30,283 --> 01:11:32,415
if they knew she was a minor.

1284
01:11:32,416 --> 01:11:34,514
Especially on that movie.

1285
01:11:34,515 --> 01:11:38,515
Listen, I cannot take
another scandal like this.

1286
01:11:40,472 --> 01:11:41,305
What?

1287
01:11:41,305 --> 01:11:42,232
Best Medicine.

1288
01:11:42,233 --> 01:11:43,278
- Huh?
- Aaron at Triad

1289
01:11:43,279 --> 01:11:45,192
said you wanted to see it for Edward.

1290
01:11:45,193 --> 01:11:46,276
Over there.

1291
01:11:47,723 --> 01:11:52,448
Frederick, Frederick, this
is not my first barbecue.

1292
01:11:52,449 --> 01:11:55,147
I know I'm in the shit here, damn it.

1293
01:11:55,148 --> 01:11:58,609
I'm counting on you, Freddy.

1294
01:11:58,610 --> 01:12:00,188
Okay?

1295
01:12:00,189 --> 01:12:05,063
Now it's your job to make
sure and keep the wolves away.

1296
01:12:05,064 --> 01:12:07,140
Good and then yours truly here

1297
01:12:07,141 --> 01:12:09,708
will come up with a creative solution

1298
01:12:09,709 --> 01:12:11,981
to make this all disappear.

1299
01:12:15,072 --> 01:12:16,989
Oh, fucking kids today.

1300
01:12:23,948 --> 01:12:26,615
Adam Stone's office.

1301
01:12:34,060 --> 01:12:35,968
Did you read this?

1302
01:12:35,969 --> 01:12:39,469
No, but lit just sent up coverage on it.

1303
01:12:44,475 --> 01:12:45,508
Haven't read anything this good

1304
01:12:45,509 --> 01:12:46,509
since The Last Goodbye.

1305
01:12:49,941 --> 01:12:51,090
Get Edward in here.

1306
01:12:51,091 --> 01:12:52,258
Lickity split.

1307
01:13:05,441 --> 01:13:06,899
Walter.

1308
01:13:06,900 --> 01:13:07,900
I need to talk to you.

1309
01:13:09,011 --> 01:13:11,704
I know you're in there.

1310
01:13:11,705 --> 01:13:12,705
Excuse me.

1311
01:13:14,081 --> 01:13:15,081
Lydia.

1312
01:13:17,798 --> 01:13:19,986
You know you're suppose to call first.

1313
01:13:19,987 --> 01:13:22,320
I hate this stupid castle.

1314
01:13:24,270 --> 01:13:25,270
Walter.

1315
01:13:26,116 --> 01:13:28,195
We need to talk.

1316
01:13:28,196 --> 01:13:29,196
God.

1317
01:13:30,733 --> 01:13:32,316
This is ridiculous.

1318
01:13:33,816 --> 01:13:34,983
Where are you?

1319
01:13:39,222 --> 01:13:42,051
Darling, what a pleasant surprise.

1320
01:13:42,052 --> 01:13:45,621
But why the hostility,
are we off our meds again?

1321
01:13:45,622 --> 01:13:47,539
Take a hike, Kenneth.

1322
01:13:49,723 --> 01:13:50,723
Go.

1323
01:13:54,466 --> 01:13:57,913
Something I can do for you, Lydia?

1324
01:13:57,914 --> 01:13:59,863
Why did you block Edward's attempt

1325
01:13:59,864 --> 01:14:02,742
to acquire the rights to that script?

1326
01:14:02,743 --> 01:14:04,222
Mm, I beg your pardon.

1327
01:14:04,223 --> 01:14:05,508
Don't fuck with me, Walter.

1328
01:14:05,509 --> 01:14:07,039
I'm not in the mood.

1329
01:14:07,040 --> 01:14:10,148
You know damn good well
what I'm talking about.

1330
01:14:10,149 --> 01:14:11,802
Oh, oh that.

1331
01:14:11,803 --> 01:14:14,337
Well my investment group seems
to of had a change of heart

1332
01:14:14,338 --> 01:14:16,948
and believes that it
could be a valuable asset.

1333
01:14:16,949 --> 01:14:19,639
But it's not like it's
part of any film library

1334
01:14:19,640 --> 01:14:21,763
you're adding to your
precious little empire.

1335
01:14:21,764 --> 01:14:23,914
It's only a script.

1336
01:14:23,915 --> 01:14:25,835
Well perhaps.

1337
01:14:25,836 --> 01:14:27,944
However I do believe Kenneth

1338
01:14:27,945 --> 01:14:31,165
would do a marvelous job directing it.

1339
01:14:31,166 --> 01:14:32,166
Oh.

1340
01:14:33,775 --> 01:14:35,102
I get it.

1341
01:14:35,103 --> 01:14:36,812
You're only doing this because Edward

1342
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,425
kicked your little Ken
doll's ass a year ago.

1343
01:14:39,426 --> 01:14:42,426
How petty and vindictive can you be?

1344
01:14:43,583 --> 01:14:45,884
Ooh, careful sweetness.

1345
01:14:45,885 --> 01:14:47,735
Have you forgotten I own this town?

1346
01:14:47,736 --> 01:14:50,335
I can see to it your precious Edward

1347
01:14:50,336 --> 01:14:52,485
never works in it again.

1348
01:14:52,486 --> 01:14:54,069
You already have.

1349
01:14:55,723 --> 01:14:58,640
I trust you can see yourself out.

1350
01:15:04,934 --> 01:15:06,267
Oh sweetheart.

1351
01:15:08,334 --> 01:15:10,573
Have you forgotten?

1352
01:15:10,574 --> 01:15:13,354
I know exactly what you're
up to professionally

1353
01:15:13,355 --> 01:15:16,362
and personally and it would be such a hoot

1354
01:15:16,363 --> 01:15:18,512
to spill the beans on the great

1355
01:15:18,513 --> 01:15:20,930
and powerful Walter Buchanan.

1356
01:15:23,757 --> 01:15:27,257
And what's really behind the curtain, hmm?

1357
01:15:29,845 --> 01:15:31,428
Your move, darling.

1358
01:15:42,726 --> 01:15:43,961
The letter saying the US

1359
01:15:43,962 --> 01:15:47,267
was very sorry for the
plane's unauthorized landing.

1360
01:15:47,268 --> 01:15:50,023
A plane left Guam received the US proof

1361
01:15:50,024 --> 01:15:52,154
as Chinese officials
negotiated the final details

1362
01:15:52,155 --> 01:15:53,082
of the release.

1363
01:15:53,083 --> 01:15:54,161
Good afternoon, Aaron.

1364
01:15:54,162 --> 01:15:55,372
Hey, I gotta make this quick,

1365
01:15:55,373 --> 01:15:57,089
but I wanted to be the
first one to call you.

1366
01:15:57,090 --> 01:15:58,522
What's going on?

1367
01:15:58,523 --> 01:16:01,050
Well I got an email from
Cutting Edge Entertainment.

1368
01:16:01,051 --> 01:16:04,004
The Best Medicine by
Jeremy Robely is all yours.

1369
01:16:04,005 --> 01:16:05,627
Congratulations.

1370
01:16:05,628 --> 01:16:07,819
Aaron, that's wonderful, thank you.

1371
01:16:07,820 --> 01:16:09,197
Well half the battle is won,

1372
01:16:09,198 --> 01:16:11,365
now go find your director.

1373
01:16:19,726 --> 01:16:21,054
Yeah, I really think
we're putting the cart

1374
01:16:21,055 --> 01:16:22,472
before the horse.

1375
01:16:23,444 --> 01:16:25,494
Especially without my director here.

1376
01:16:25,495 --> 01:16:28,853
You can never start
this process too soon.

1377
01:16:28,854 --> 01:16:30,239
They're all quite good.

1378
01:16:31,072 --> 01:16:35,552
Let's take a look at the
role of Maxine then, shall we?

1379
01:16:39,181 --> 01:16:40,014
Hey, you flipped through that one

1380
01:16:40,015 --> 01:16:42,264
a little fast there, chief.

1381
01:16:43,940 --> 01:16:46,758
For who, the granddaughter?

1382
01:16:46,759 --> 01:16:48,515
Edward, please.

1383
01:16:48,516 --> 01:16:52,683
She's a rising star and
the agency's first choice.

1384
01:16:55,257 --> 01:16:57,790
She's a lovely girl, but she's just,

1385
01:16:57,791 --> 01:17:00,208
she's not right for the part.

1386
01:17:02,130 --> 01:17:04,161
What about her?

1387
01:17:04,162 --> 01:17:05,287
You really want to force an audience

1388
01:17:05,288 --> 01:17:07,871
to stare at her for 93 minutes?

1389
01:17:09,974 --> 01:17:11,489
Starred on Broadway in Annie.

1390
01:17:11,490 --> 01:17:14,992
She studied at the Strasbourg Institute.

1391
01:17:14,993 --> 01:17:18,458
Summer Stock at Westport, great theater.

1392
01:17:18,459 --> 01:17:19,967
Impressive credits, Adam,
what's wrong with that?

1393
01:17:19,968 --> 01:17:21,799
She's a total diva.

1394
01:17:21,800 --> 01:17:24,653
She's let success go to her head.

1395
01:17:24,654 --> 01:17:25,605
Can you arrange a meeting.

1396
01:17:25,606 --> 01:17:28,064
Ah look, you're gonna be much happier

1397
01:17:28,065 --> 01:17:30,777
with her, trust me on this.

1398
01:17:30,778 --> 01:17:33,732
You gotta a reel on her I can see?

1399
01:17:33,733 --> 01:17:37,150
The agency is really excited about her.

1400
01:17:39,357 --> 01:17:42,524
You are staring at the next big thing.

1401
01:17:44,196 --> 01:17:45,529
I'm telling you.

1402
01:17:47,315 --> 01:17:48,732
Look, it's getting late, Edward

1403
01:17:48,733 --> 01:17:51,277
and I'm doing you a really big favor here.

1404
01:17:51,278 --> 01:17:52,277
I've already given her the script

1405
01:17:52,278 --> 01:17:54,501
and she loves it and she's
memorized the part already

1406
01:17:54,502 --> 01:17:55,335
and she wants

1407
01:17:55,336 --> 01:17:56,682
to play it.
You're sleeping with her.

1408
01:17:56,683 --> 01:17:58,996
Oh god, you're sleeping with her.

1409
01:17:58,997 --> 01:18:00,653
I'm a happily married man, okay?

1410
01:18:00,654 --> 01:18:04,208
So just back off.

1411
01:18:04,209 --> 01:18:05,376
She's perfect.

1412
01:18:06,537 --> 01:18:10,009
She got a lot of sparkle in her eyes.

1413
01:18:10,010 --> 01:18:11,010
She's tall.

1414
01:18:11,831 --> 01:18:12,839
You're tall.

1415
01:18:12,840 --> 01:18:15,768
She's teachable, I mean what
the hell else do you need?

1416
01:18:15,769 --> 01:18:17,904
Your girlfriend there
has no film credits

1417
01:18:17,905 --> 01:18:19,905
and no stage experience.

1418
01:18:21,103 --> 01:18:22,824
She's got a video on YouTube,

1419
01:18:22,825 --> 01:18:25,242
over a hundred thousand hits.

1420
01:18:27,143 --> 01:18:28,476
You know what?

1421
01:18:29,425 --> 01:18:32,794
This project doesn't belong here.

1422
01:18:32,795 --> 01:18:35,295
I'm trying to help you, man.

1423
01:18:36,366 --> 01:18:37,866
Edward, my friend,

1424
01:18:39,132 --> 01:18:40,419
what are you doing?

1425
01:18:40,420 --> 01:18:42,290
Please, god, man, have a seat,

1426
01:18:42,291 --> 01:18:44,925
we can talk this thing through.

1427
01:18:44,926 --> 01:18:48,434
If you go out that door,
you're making a huge mistake.

1428
01:18:48,435 --> 01:18:50,468
I'll take my chances, excuse me.

1429
01:18:50,469 --> 01:18:52,245
Where's your passion?

1430
01:18:52,246 --> 01:18:53,161
Where's the fight?

1431
01:18:53,162 --> 01:18:56,473
Or did that die with
the rest of your career?

1432
01:18:56,474 --> 01:18:59,259
You need me on this project.

1433
01:18:59,260 --> 01:19:01,438
When you went off and did
your holier than thou shit,

1434
01:19:01,439 --> 01:19:04,790
nobody cared and now that
you're back, they care less.

1435
01:19:04,791 --> 01:19:06,467
Excuse me.

1436
01:19:06,468 --> 01:19:08,218
And one email blast

1437
01:19:10,191 --> 01:19:12,449
and this little project is a big taboo.

1438
01:19:12,450 --> 01:19:14,230
Nobody in Hollywood is gonna look at it.

1439
01:19:14,231 --> 01:19:17,504
Not unless they're desperate
or washed up just like you.

1440
01:19:19,664 --> 01:19:20,744
Well that's it.

1441
01:19:20,745 --> 01:19:21,989
That's what I've been waiting for,

1442
01:19:21,990 --> 01:19:24,332
the real Edward Forester finally shows up.

1443
01:19:24,333 --> 01:19:26,620
Go on, old man, give me your best shot.

1444
01:19:26,621 --> 01:19:29,038
Go on, knock me the fuck out.

1445
01:19:42,507 --> 01:19:45,390
Edward, please I just wanted to see

1446
01:19:45,391 --> 01:19:47,421
if you really believed in this like I do.

1447
01:19:47,422 --> 01:19:51,339
I mean, please Edward,
I just, I need this one.

1448
01:19:53,063 --> 01:19:54,313
Just this once.

1449
01:19:56,684 --> 01:19:57,851
Sorry, Adam.

1450
01:20:04,505 --> 01:20:05,505
Fuck.

1451
01:20:17,894 --> 01:20:18,893
Yes Edward.

1452
01:20:18,894 --> 01:20:22,022
I got the rights back
to the Best Medicine.

1453
01:20:22,023 --> 01:20:24,753
Whatever you did, thank you.

1454
01:20:24,754 --> 01:20:25,887
You're welcome.

1455
01:20:25,888 --> 01:20:26,790
Did you read it?

1456
01:20:26,791 --> 01:20:28,183
Yes.

1457
01:20:28,184 --> 01:20:29,376
And?

1458
01:20:29,377 --> 01:20:32,735
I couldn't put it
down, I was touched so.

1459
01:20:32,736 --> 01:20:36,819
Your writer captures
everything that's honorable,

1460
01:20:38,112 --> 01:20:41,325
fine, and true.

1461
01:20:41,326 --> 01:20:43,243
For God's sake, please.

1462
01:20:44,238 --> 01:20:47,633
Don't let Hollywood screw this up.

1463
01:20:47,634 --> 01:20:48,964
So you like it.

1464
01:20:48,965 --> 01:20:50,048
I loved it.

1465
01:20:51,911 --> 01:20:53,328
It's you, Edward.

1466
01:20:55,368 --> 01:20:57,868
It's you from start to finish.

1467
01:21:00,010 --> 01:21:03,093
Is there anything I can do for you?

1468
01:21:06,599 --> 01:21:07,599
Lydia?

1469
01:21:11,754 --> 01:21:12,837
I gotta go.

1470
01:21:24,101 --> 01:21:25,434
Hey, Forester.

1471
01:21:29,786 --> 01:21:32,948
The other night was a very
special celebration for you

1472
01:21:32,949 --> 01:21:34,116
and I ruin it.

1473
01:21:35,458 --> 01:21:37,162
No, you didn't, I just...

1474
01:21:37,163 --> 01:21:40,423
Why do you always try
to correct me when I talk?

1475
01:21:40,424 --> 01:21:44,333
Why don't you just be nice
and agree with me, you know?

1476
01:21:44,334 --> 01:21:46,417
Okay, I agree to agree.

1477
01:21:50,012 --> 01:21:50,845
I have to get to work.

1478
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:51,678
I'm late.

1479
01:21:51,679 --> 01:21:53,345
Of course you are.

1480
01:21:55,891 --> 01:21:58,133
Why don't you ask me out?

1481
01:21:58,134 --> 01:22:00,995
You know, like an engagement.

1482
01:22:00,996 --> 01:22:02,661
You mean a date?

1483
01:22:02,662 --> 01:22:04,565
That would be nice.

1484
01:22:04,566 --> 01:22:06,465
How 'bout dinner tonight?

1485
01:22:06,466 --> 01:22:07,373
For three?

1486
01:22:07,374 --> 01:22:10,411
Yes, what time is good for you?

1487
01:22:10,412 --> 01:22:12,070
Where are taking us?

1488
01:22:12,071 --> 01:22:14,154
Someplace very special.

1489
01:22:15,082 --> 01:22:17,253
Okay, six o'clock, don't be late.

1490
01:22:17,254 --> 01:22:19,304
I'm going to paint very fast.

1491
01:22:19,305 --> 01:22:22,633
Oh hey, I gotta take a
road trip up to Ventura,

1492
01:22:22,634 --> 01:22:24,636
could really us a co-pilot,

1493
01:22:24,637 --> 01:22:27,327
one that likes ice cream.

1494
01:22:27,328 --> 01:22:29,804
Okay, I will get your co-pilot.

1495
01:22:29,805 --> 01:22:32,287
And

1496
01:22:32,288 --> 01:22:34,209
I dress very nice for you tonight.

1497
01:22:34,210 --> 01:22:35,543

No, no, no,

01:25:19,262 --> 01:25:20,849
I just I need your help.

1546
01:25:20,850 --> 01:25:22,660
A Captain over there said you might know

1547
01:25:22,661 --> 01:25:24,012
where I could find a friend of mine.

1548
01:25:24,013 --> 01:25:26,001
Jeremy Robely?

1549
01:25:26,002 --> 01:25:28,592
Man, I thought you were trying
to pin the kid there on me.

1550
01:25:28,593 --> 01:25:30,100
Oh, no.

1551
01:25:30,101 --> 01:25:31,684
Sorry to alarm you.

1552
01:25:32,611 --> 01:25:34,909
I understand Jeremy loves to fish.

1553
01:25:34,910 --> 01:25:37,061
Yeah, a clean cut looking kid.

1554
01:25:37,062 --> 01:25:38,559
Yeah, he's a good kid.

1555
01:25:38,560 --> 01:25:39,941
Can't fish for shit though.

1556
01:25:39,942 --> 01:25:41,219
That's Chester.

1557
01:25:41,220 --> 01:25:43,037
Chester always brings the ice cold beer

1558
01:25:43,038 --> 01:25:43,936
but never gives you nothing

1559
01:25:43,936 --> 01:25:44,845
when you clean his damn fish.

1560
01:25:44,846 --> 01:25:46,303
Well it's 'cause
Chester's afraid of you.

1561
01:25:46,304 --> 01:25:48,136
It's because of all that
tattoo stuff on your arms.

1562
01:25:48,137 --> 01:25:50,325
Man, if I was him, I wouldn't
tip you nothing neither.

1563
01:25:50,326 --> 01:25:52,066
You're a scary looking dude.

1564
01:25:52,067 --> 01:25:54,438
I'm an approachable person.

1565
01:25:54,439 --> 01:25:55,363
I know Jeremy.

1566
01:25:55,364 --> 01:25:56,994
He's a little shrimp, right?

1567
01:25:56,995 --> 01:25:58,097
Okay.

1568
01:25:58,098 --> 01:25:58,931
Yeah.

1569
01:25:58,932 --> 01:26:01,301
Now that little dude, he can fish.

1570
01:26:01,302 --> 01:26:03,691
And these aren't gang
tattoos either, knucklehead.

1571
01:26:03,692 --> 01:26:05,340
I told you they're military.

1572
01:26:05,341 --> 01:26:07,472
French Foreign Legion.

1573
01:26:07,473 --> 01:26:11,015
Never saw you speak a word of French.

1574
01:26:11,016 --> 01:26:12,065
You got a card of something?

1575
01:26:12,066 --> 01:26:14,347
Next time I run into
Jeremy, I'll pass it along

1576
01:26:14,348 --> 01:26:15,197
and tell him you're looking for him.

1577
01:26:15,198 --> 01:26:17,253
Yeah, I'd appreciate that.

1578
01:26:21,157 --> 01:26:23,740
Where did he go, he was just here?

1579
01:26:23,741 --> 01:26:24,741
Matthew!

1580
01:26:27,242 --> 01:26:28,242
Matthew.

1581
01:26:32,210 --> 01:26:33,210
Matthew!

1582
01:26:34,840 --> 01:26:35,840
Matthew!

1583
01:26:47,139 --> 01:26:48,139
Matthew!

1584
01:26:53,520 --> 01:26:54,844
Have you seen the little
boy who was with me?

1585
01:26:54,845 --> 01:26:57,128
The big curly hair, brown shirt?

1586
01:26:57,129 --> 01:26:58,129
No, sorry.

1587
01:27:09,407 --> 01:27:10,740
- Matthew!
- Hey.

1588
01:27:11,965 --> 01:27:13,798
Sorry, I, I'm sorry.

1589
01:27:20,218 --> 01:27:21,218
Sir!

1590
01:27:22,316 --> 01:27:24,481
I'm looking for a little boy who's lost.

1591
01:27:24,482 --> 01:27:27,273
He's got dark complexion, big curly hair,

1592
01:27:27,274 --> 01:27:28,747
he was wearing a brown
shirt and blue jeans.

1593
01:27:28,748 --> 01:27:29,581
How old is he?

1594
01:27:29,582 --> 01:27:31,732
He looks like
he's four, maybe five.

1595
01:27:31,733 --> 01:27:33,152
When did you see him last?

1596
01:27:33,153 --> 01:27:35,192
Just a minute ago over
at the dock entrance.

1597
01:27:35,193 --> 01:27:38,169
This is Dias, has anyone
got a 20 on a lost boy.

1598
01:27:38,170 --> 01:27:39,977
Four years old, brown shirt, blue jeans,

1599
01:27:39,978 --> 01:27:42,220
last seen over at Sea Bassey.

1600
01:27:42,221 --> 01:27:44,405
He's carrying a stuffed monkey.

1601
01:27:44,406 --> 01:27:45,753
You mean like the one
that's in your hands?

1602
01:27:45,754 --> 01:27:47,329
Yes, and this one.

1603
01:27:47,330 --> 01:27:48,670
What's the child's name?

1604
01:27:48,671 --> 01:27:50,336
Matthew, but he can't talk.

1605
01:27:50,337 --> 01:27:51,867
Okay, sir, calm down,
I'm trying to help.

1606
01:27:51,868 --> 01:27:53,371
Does Matthew know how to swim?

1607
01:27:53,372 --> 01:27:56,233
- What?
- Does he know how to swim?

1608
01:27:56,234 --> 01:27:57,484
I don't know.

1609
01:27:59,297 --> 01:28:02,374
So Jolynda, we got ourselves a deal?

1610
01:28:02,375 --> 01:28:04,153
What do you think?
Yeah, it's a nice car.

1611
01:28:04,154 --> 01:28:05,292
All right, gotta deal.
All right.

1612
01:28:05,293 --> 01:28:07,137
Yeah, get the paperwork started then.

1613
01:28:07,138 --> 01:28:08,805
Sounds good.

1614
01:28:09,646 --> 01:28:10,969
All right.

1615
01:28:10,970 --> 01:28:12,507
Can you run this for me, babe?

1616
01:28:12,508 --> 01:28:13,508
Sure.

1617
01:28:15,529 --> 01:28:17,195
You're selling the silver bullet?

1618
01:28:17,196 --> 01:28:19,516
Yeah, I get a little too
much attention in that thing.

1619
01:28:20,740 --> 01:28:22,138
So I get a chick magnet.

1620
01:28:29,767 --> 01:28:33,089
You guys having fun or what?

1621
01:28:35,879 --> 01:28:36,879
What?

1622
01:28:41,203 --> 01:28:43,599
Roxy, Matthew's missing.

1623
01:28:43,600 --> 01:28:44,735
They can't find him anywhere!

1624
01:28:44,736 --> 01:28:45,818
Missing from daycare?

1625
01:28:45,819 --> 01:28:47,775
No, no, no, from Ventura Harbor.

1626
01:28:47,776 --> 01:28:48,609
Please you have to...

1627
01:28:48,609 --> 01:28:49,528
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

1628
01:28:49,529 --> 01:28:52,210
All right, Danny, we gotta go!

1629
01:28:52,211 --> 01:28:53,757
What?

1630
01:28:53,758 --> 01:28:54,758
Roxy!

1631
01:28:55,775 --> 01:28:57,339
Hey, can you finish the windows

1632
01:28:57,340 --> 01:28:58,289
before you high-tail it outta here?

1633
01:28:58,290 --> 01:29:00,844
No, we don't have
time, her boy's missing!

1634
01:29:00,845 --> 01:29:02,825
Hold on.

1635
01:29:02,826 --> 01:29:04,129
Take the silver bullet.

1636
01:29:04,130 --> 01:29:05,441
It's faster.
Come on, Catarina!

1637
01:29:05,442 --> 01:29:06,758
Excuse me.

1638
01:29:06,759 --> 01:29:08,216
Sorry guys, it's an emergency.

1639
01:29:08,217 --> 01:29:09,217
Sorry.

1640
01:29:10,853 --> 01:29:12,037
Call me when you find him.

1641
01:29:12,038 --> 01:29:13,299
We will.

1642
01:29:30,581 --> 01:29:31,581
He couldn't be that...

1643
01:29:35,811 --> 01:29:36,876
Did you find him?

1644
01:29:36,877 --> 01:29:37,710
Are you the boy's mother?

1645
01:29:37,710 --> 01:29:38,703
Did you find him, please tell me?

1646
01:29:38,704 --> 01:29:39,793
Did you find Matthew?
Catarina,

1647
01:29:39,794 --> 01:29:40,876
they're doing everything they can.

1648
01:29:40,877 --> 01:29:41,751
No, no, no, no, no, no.

1649
01:29:41,751 --> 01:29:42,629
You lost him?

1650
01:29:42,630 --> 01:29:44,352
How could you be so careless?

1651
01:29:44,353 --> 01:29:45,357
I am so sorry.

1652
01:29:45,358 --> 01:29:46,191
- He just...
- No, no, no, no.

1653
01:29:46,192 --> 01:29:47,334
- He was just...
- I trusted you

1654
01:29:47,335 --> 01:29:48,203
and then you just let - Ma'am.

1655
01:29:48,203 --> 01:29:49,092
- Go of him.
- Come over here.

1656
01:29:49,093 --> 01:29:50,420
- Who are you?
- Ma'am, ma'am.

1657
01:29:50,421 --> 01:29:52,373
- What good are you, huh?
- Ma'am!

1658
01:29:52,374 --> 01:29:53,394
- Ma'am.
- Oh yes, yes.

1659
01:29:53,395 --> 01:29:55,269
Our units are
surrounding the area, okay?

1660
01:29:55,270 --> 01:29:56,241
The boy shouldn't be too far.

1661
01:29:56,242 --> 01:29:57,594
Mr. Forester answered some questions.

1662
01:29:57,595 --> 01:29:58,610
- He knows nothing.
- We'll find him.

1663
01:29:58,611 --> 01:30:00,051
- He knows nothing.
- We'll find him.

1664
01:30:00,564 --> 01:30:03,239
Ma'am, you're gonna have to calm down.

1665
01:30:03,240 --> 01:30:04,221
Calm down.

1666
01:30:04,222 --> 01:30:06,173
Do you have a picture of Matthew?

1667
01:30:06,174 --> 01:30:07,007
Yes, I do, in my phone.

1668
01:30:07,008 --> 01:30:08,805
In my phone in the car, Roxy.
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.

1669
01:30:08,806 --> 01:30:09,639
Yes.

1670
01:30:09,640 --> 01:30:12,515
Are you the child's mother?

1671
01:30:12,516 --> 01:30:13,516
No, no.

1672
01:30:14,944 --> 01:30:16,334
His grandmother.

1673
01:30:16,335 --> 01:30:17,553
Where's the boy's mother?

1674
01:30:17,554 --> 01:30:18,584
She's dead.

1675
01:30:18,585 --> 01:30:19,823
Deceased?

1676
01:30:19,824 --> 01:30:21,244
Yes, that is what I said.

1677
01:30:21,245 --> 01:30:22,503
She's dead.

1678
01:30:22,504 --> 01:30:23,983
What about the father?

1679
01:30:23,984 --> 01:30:25,312
He's not involved.

1680
01:30:25,313 --> 01:30:26,313
Okay.

1681
01:30:28,340 --> 01:30:29,901
There he is.

1682
01:30:29,902 --> 01:30:31,814
That's Matthew?

1683
01:30:31,815 --> 01:30:33,153
Oh, he's a beautiful boy.

1684
01:30:33,154 --> 01:30:34,425
Mm-hmm.

1685
01:30:34,426 --> 01:30:35,968
Take a look.

1686
01:30:35,969 --> 01:30:36,850
What's his date of birth?

1687
01:30:36,851 --> 01:30:39,892
June 15th and
he's going to be six.

1688
01:30:39,893 --> 01:30:40,726
Six.

1689
01:30:40,727 --> 01:30:42,308
Can he swim?

1690
01:30:42,309 --> 01:30:43,976
- Huh?
- Can he swim?

1691
01:30:46,277 --> 01:30:47,944
No, okay, it's fine.

1692
01:30:49,029 --> 01:30:49,862
It's okay.

1693
01:30:49,863 --> 01:30:52,022
- Oh my god, he can't swim.
- No, no, no, that's okay.

1694
01:30:52,023 --> 01:30:53,583
- No, it's not okay.
- It's okay, we'll find him.

1695
01:30:53,584 --> 01:30:54,824
It's okay, he's gonna be found.

1696
01:30:55,930 --> 01:30:56,851
Calm down.

1697
01:30:56,852 --> 01:30:58,098
I wish you were dead!

1698
01:30:58,099 --> 01:30:59,403
Catarina.

1699
01:30:59,404 --> 01:31:01,071
- Dead!
- Ahoy there.

1700
01:31:03,095 --> 01:31:05,910
- Mateo.
- Oh, you see him.

1701
01:31:05,911 --> 01:31:06,911
Mateo!

1702
01:31:09,498 --> 01:31:10,737
Mateo!

1703
01:31:10,738 --> 01:31:11,738
Oh my god.

1704
01:31:14,013 --> 01:31:15,128
Oh my god.

1705
01:31:15,129 --> 01:31:15,962
Oh my god.

1706
01:31:15,963 --> 01:31:17,886
Come here, come here, come here.

1707
01:31:17,887 --> 01:31:19,890
Baby.

1708
01:31:19,891 --> 01:31:20,891
Oh baby!

1709
01:31:22,165 --> 01:31:23,546
I was coming back from lunch

1710
01:31:23,547 --> 01:31:25,492
and sitting on the edge of
the boat playing with Ahab

1711
01:31:25,493 --> 01:31:28,110
was this good-looking little boy.

1712
01:31:28,111 --> 01:31:29,039
He's all right.

1713
01:31:29,040 --> 01:31:31,116
Thank you so much, thank you, thank you.

1714
01:31:31,117 --> 01:31:33,185
All good, and you're welcome.

1715
01:31:33,186 --> 01:31:34,934
Hey honey.

1716
01:31:34,935 --> 01:31:36,632
Hi, is this your grandma?

1717
01:31:36,633 --> 01:31:37,741
Sweetheart, I need you tell me,

1718
01:31:37,742 --> 01:31:38,803
is this your grandmother?

1719
01:31:38,804 --> 01:31:41,211
Ah officer, the boy is unable to speak.

1720
01:31:41,212 --> 01:31:42,360
Oh there's plenty of pictures

1721
01:31:42,361 --> 01:31:43,224
of the two of them in here.

1722
01:31:43,225 --> 01:31:44,941
- I think we're okay.
- Yeah.

1723
01:31:44,942 --> 01:31:45,775
I'm gonna go call it in.

1724
01:31:45,776 --> 01:31:47,203
Yep.

1725
01:31:47,204 --> 01:31:48,127
Ma'am?

1726
01:31:48,128 --> 01:31:51,808
Do you wanna press any
charges against Mr. Forester?

1727
01:31:51,809 --> 01:31:52,995
No.

1728
01:31:52,996 --> 01:31:54,246
No?

1729
01:31:55,114 --> 01:31:56,006
All right.

1730
01:31:56,007 --> 01:31:58,673
Looks like our work here's done.

1731
01:32:00,869 --> 01:32:02,498
You got it?

1732
01:32:03,359 --> 01:32:04,356
Thank you.

1733
01:32:04,357 --> 01:32:06,690
You're welcome.

1734
01:32:06,691 --> 01:32:07,691
Oh you.

1735
01:32:16,484 --> 01:32:17,684
Thanks, Captain.

1736
01:32:17,685 --> 01:32:18,852
My pleasure.

1737
01:33:17,933 --> 01:33:20,025
There's no room in Roxy's car

1738
01:33:20,026 --> 01:33:22,609
and you have the only car seat.

1739
01:34:04,979 --> 01:34:08,580
I'm sorry for the ugly
things I said to you.

1740
01:34:08,581 --> 01:34:10,164
I didn't mean them.

1741
01:34:13,555 --> 01:34:16,629
I've never been so scared in my life.

1742
01:34:19,037 --> 01:34:20,750
Can you forgive me?

1743
01:34:20,751 --> 01:34:22,276
Please.

1744
01:34:22,277 --> 01:34:23,836
Yes, of course.

1745
01:34:23,837 --> 01:34:25,004
I forgive you.

1746
01:34:26,775 --> 01:34:28,608
It sounds so simple.

1747
01:34:37,477 --> 01:34:40,310
I never forgave my daughter, Rosy.

1748
01:34:42,056 --> 01:34:44,594
Not caring for my grandson.

1749
01:34:44,595 --> 01:34:47,428
Leaving him in his filth for days.

1750
01:34:49,437 --> 01:34:51,020
All for damn drugs.

1751
01:34:55,115 --> 01:34:58,198
We don't even know who the father is.

1752
01:34:59,475 --> 01:35:01,475
What happened to Rosy?

1753
01:35:05,003 --> 01:35:08,003
It was three years ago, Christmas.

1754
01:35:11,866 --> 01:35:14,302
She just gave Mateo this little monkey

1755
01:35:14,303 --> 01:35:16,220
he will never put down.

1756
01:35:18,992 --> 01:35:22,825
It's the only nice thing
she ever did for him.

1757
01:35:24,803 --> 01:35:27,221
There was a knock at the door

1758
01:35:27,222 --> 01:35:29,389
and she went to answer it.

1759
01:35:30,843 --> 01:35:32,510
It was drug dealers.

1760
01:35:37,290 --> 01:35:39,290
He shot her in the head.

1761
01:35:45,289 --> 01:35:49,622
She was holding Matthew in
her arms when I happened.

1762
01:35:52,678 --> 01:35:55,178
He hasn't spoken a word since.

1763
01:35:58,489 --> 01:35:59,822
I am so sorry.

1764
01:36:02,393 --> 01:36:06,226
All the time I take
my pain out on everyone.

1765
01:36:07,193 --> 01:36:09,276
Just pissed at the world.

1766
01:36:16,596 --> 01:36:17,596
Bad habit.

1767
01:36:20,108 --> 01:36:24,057
Hell I can certainly understand why.

1768
01:36:24,058 --> 01:36:25,974
Look what it's gotten me, hmm.

1769
01:36:25,975 --> 01:36:26,975
Nada.

1770
01:36:29,224 --> 01:36:30,224
Nada.

1771
01:36:39,412 --> 01:36:40,412
Seat belt.

1772
01:36:42,163 --> 01:36:43,163
Please.

1773
01:37:25,478 --> 01:37:26,811
Hey, you hungry?

1774
01:37:28,403 --> 01:37:31,820
How 'bout something healthy for a change?

1775
01:37:56,898 --> 01:37:58,597
What are we doing?

1776
01:37:58,598 --> 01:37:59,935
Stopping for some fresh fruit.

1777
01:37:59,936 --> 01:38:01,939
I fell asleep.

1778
01:38:01,940 --> 01:38:03,164
Did I snore?

1779
01:38:03,165 --> 01:38:05,003
Not too much.

1780
01:38:05,004 --> 01:38:07,108
Why didn't you wake me up?

1781
01:38:09,805 --> 01:38:11,624
Hey cutie pie.

1782
01:38:19,823 --> 01:38:20,857
I don't have any money.

1783
01:38:20,858 --> 01:38:22,233
I was working and then you called.

1784
01:38:22,234 --> 01:38:23,462
I didn't get paid, so.

1785
01:38:23,463 --> 01:38:25,130
Give me your hand.

1786
01:38:26,005 --> 01:38:28,172
I'll buy, you pick it out.

1787
01:38:29,343 --> 01:38:33,188
Okay, but I'm going to pay you back.

1788
01:38:33,189 --> 01:38:34,518
What do you want?

1789
01:38:34,519 --> 01:38:35,685
Whatever you guys are having.

1790
01:38:35,686 --> 01:38:36,769
Here, okay.

1791
01:38:39,758 --> 01:38:43,591
Here you go.

1792
01:39:18,188 --> 01:39:19,188
Jeremy.

1793
01:39:21,766 --> 01:39:22,766
Hey Jeremy!

1794
01:39:39,125 --> 01:39:40,678
This is a
pleasant surprise, sir.

1795
01:39:40,679 --> 01:39:42,187
Well it certainly is.

1796
01:39:42,188 --> 01:39:44,596
You're not an easy man to find.

1797
01:39:44,597 --> 01:39:46,045
What are you doing out here?

1798
01:39:46,046 --> 01:39:47,146
I live here.

1799
01:39:47,147 --> 01:39:48,535
This is my parent's farm.

1800
01:39:48,536 --> 01:39:50,263
What are you doing here?

1801
01:39:50,264 --> 01:39:52,087
It's a long story.

1802
01:39:52,088 --> 01:39:53,298
Do you mind if I call them?

1803
01:39:53,299 --> 01:39:55,363
They would be really honored to meet you.

1804
01:39:55,364 --> 01:39:57,114
Oh no, sure please.

1805
01:39:58,531 --> 01:39:59,531
Excellent.

1806
01:40:04,468 --> 01:40:07,381
This film doesn't require a ton of money.

1807
01:40:07,382 --> 01:40:09,096
And the whole thing could
take place right here

1808
01:40:09,097 --> 01:40:11,467
and in my parent's
farmhouse down the road.

1809
01:40:11,468 --> 01:40:14,418
And we'll get a cast that's
passionate about the piece.

1810
01:40:14,419 --> 01:40:16,029
God knows actors rarely get a chance

1811
01:40:16,030 --> 01:40:18,927
to do a script they love.

1812
01:40:18,928 --> 01:40:21,375
What could you do this film
for, I mean bare bones?

1813
01:40:21,376 --> 01:40:23,797
My college buddies
will work for the credit.

1814
01:40:23,798 --> 01:40:25,615
We're always helping each other out.

1815
01:40:25,616 --> 01:40:27,695
Extras are easy.

1816
01:40:27,696 --> 01:40:29,262
Put a word out with my pastor.

1817
01:40:29,263 --> 01:40:31,968
He can announce it at church.

1818
01:40:31,969 --> 01:40:36,969
I guess with lights, camera,
and action about 300 grand.

1819
01:40:37,305 --> 01:40:38,925
All in.

1820
01:40:38,926 --> 01:40:42,530
But I don't have access to
that kind of money, sir.

1821
01:40:42,531 --> 01:40:44,340
I have a source.

1822
01:40:44,341 --> 01:40:46,689
Someone that believes
in you and your script.

1823
01:40:46,690 --> 01:40:47,991
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

1824
01:40:47,992 --> 01:40:49,367
Would I know them?

1825
01:40:49,368 --> 01:40:50,668
Me.

1826
01:40:50,669 --> 01:40:52,135
I sold my Beverly Hills home

1827
01:40:52,136 --> 01:40:56,469
with just enough of a nest
egg to finance your film.

1828
01:40:58,069 --> 01:41:00,736
Sir, I don't know what to say.

1829
01:41:03,602 --> 01:41:05,937
We are roasting out here.

1830
01:41:05,938 --> 01:41:07,938
Hey guys, meet Jeremy,

1831
01:41:09,580 --> 01:41:12,216
writer and director of my next film.

1832
01:41:12,217 --> 01:41:13,315
You already know Matthew.

1833
01:41:13,316 --> 01:41:15,312
Your co-pilot, I remember.

1834
01:41:15,313 --> 01:41:17,279
And this Latin beauty.

1835
01:41:17,280 --> 01:41:19,479
Catarina Maria Alana Moralis.

1836
01:41:19,480 --> 01:41:20,736
Pleasure ma'am.

1837
01:41:20,737 --> 01:41:21,871
I am his date.

1838
01:41:21,872 --> 01:41:23,122
Yes, you are.

1839
01:41:24,112 --> 01:41:25,827
Ah, Jeremy's parents have invited us over

1840
01:41:25,828 --> 01:41:27,357
for a real home cooked meal.

1841
01:41:28,515 --> 01:41:30,510
Wait a minute, I can't go like this.

1842
01:41:30,511 --> 01:41:31,931
Why didn't you tell this?

1843
01:41:31,932 --> 01:41:35,016
I need a shower, I need to wash my hair.

1844
01:41:35,017 --> 01:41:36,703
Okay, nevermind.

1845
01:41:36,704 --> 01:41:37,537
It's okay.

1846
01:41:37,538 --> 01:41:40,477
If it's okay for you, it's okay for me.

1847
01:41:40,478 --> 01:41:42,749
Great, you guys can
follow me in your car.

1848
01:41:42,750 --> 01:41:44,763
Lead the way.

1849
01:41:44,764 --> 01:41:47,181
Catarina Maria Alana Moralis.

1850
01:41:48,189 --> 01:41:49,637
- You like my name?
- Yes I do.

1851
01:41:49,638 --> 01:41:50,705
What is your real name?

1852
01:41:50,706 --> 01:41:52,175
I promise not to laugh.

1853
01:41:52,176 --> 01:41:53,843
It's Bud Brokiski.

1854
01:41:55,158 --> 01:41:56,161
What?

1855
01:41:56,162 --> 01:41:57,162
Junior.

1856
01:42:00,998 --> 01:42:02,848
What's worse than that?

1857
01:42:02,849 --> 01:42:05,797
Matthew, where's your stuffed animal?

1858
01:42:05,798 --> 01:42:07,298
It's in the car.

1859
01:42:08,437 --> 01:42:10,395
Did he speak?

1860
01:42:10,396 --> 01:42:12,894
Mateo, did you speak?

1861
01:42:12,895 --> 01:42:13,895
You spoke?

1862
01:42:15,474 --> 01:42:18,380
Oh my god, you say it again.

1863
01:42:18,381 --> 01:42:19,921
It's in the car.

1864
01:42:19,922 --> 01:42:21,505
Oh my.

1865
01:42:24,150 --> 01:42:25,567
You guys ready?

1866
01:42:30,060 --> 01:42:31,259
Matthew.
