00:00:18,927 --> 00:00:23,921
Laestadianism is a Lutheran revival
movement started in the mid-1800s.

4
00:00:24,007 --> 00:00:27,283
They preach of repentance
and forgiveness.

5
00:00:27,367 --> 00:00:31,679
Their summer services are
the largest summer event in Finland.

6
00:00:31,767 --> 00:00:34,918
Finland has 110,000
Conservative Laestadians.

7
00:00:35,007 --> 00:00:37,965
They take the Bible literally.

8
00:00:38,047 --> 00:00:42,438
Contraceptives, alcohol, TV,
rhythm music, and premarital sex -

9
00:00:42,527 --> 00:00:44,563
are forbidden.

10
00:01:14,967 --> 00:01:18,676
Dear Lord, bless this day.

11
00:01:19,447 --> 00:01:23,998
<i>Protect my family</i>
<i>and give me strength.</i>

12
00:01:25,247 --> 00:01:27,715
Wake up.

13
00:01:30,447 --> 00:01:32,802
Good morning.

14
00:01:33,007 --> 00:01:36,283
Wake up, Martta.

15
00:01:38,847 --> 00:01:40,997
Good morning.

16
00:01:41,447 --> 00:01:46,157
Morning, Lars.
Were you playing with your toy car?

17
00:01:46,287 --> 00:01:50,803
Shall we wake the others?
Take the car with you.

18
00:01:50,887 --> 00:01:52,479
Wake up.

19
00:01:55,327 --> 00:01:57,045
Wake up.

20
00:02:31,567 --> 00:02:34,764
God's greetings.

21
00:02:41,367 --> 00:02:44,916
Man's flesh is corrupt.

22
00:02:45,967 --> 00:02:51,758
It was corrupted completely
when man fell from Paradise.

23
00:02:52,367 --> 00:02:57,282
Even man's sense,
a gift to us from God -

24
00:02:57,607 --> 00:03:00,599
was ruined by the Archfiend.

25
00:03:00,687 --> 00:03:04,885
<i>But God's grace...</i>
-That curly-haired boy in the back.

26
00:03:06,927 --> 00:03:09,361
He's too basic.

27
00:03:10,807 --> 00:03:15,801
What about Paavo? He's really smart.
-Nah, he's so lame.

28
00:03:15,887 --> 00:03:20,881
From that day on,
I have felt God's love in my heart.

29
00:03:21,607 --> 00:03:27,557
Thus I beseech you, youngsters,
to keep your faith.

30
00:03:27,767 --> 00:03:32,363
What the world has to offer
is deceitful -

31
00:03:32,447 --> 00:03:36,804
and those who follow
the Archfiend's temptations -

32
00:03:36,887 --> 00:03:40,562
will seldom get
what the world promises.

33
00:03:40,647 --> 00:03:44,640
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ.

34
00:03:44,727 --> 00:03:48,003
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ.

35
00:03:48,807 --> 00:03:53,722
Let us pray like our Lord,
Jesus Christ, has taught us.

36
00:03:54,807 --> 00:03:58,356
<i>Our Father, who art in Heaven</i>

37
00:03:58,487 --> 00:04:01,877
<i>Hallowed be thy name</i>

38
00:04:02,007 --> 00:04:04,999
<i>Thy Kingdom come</i>

39
00:04:05,087 --> 00:04:10,923
<i>Thy will be done</i>
<i>On earth as it is in Heaven</i>

40
00:04:11,367 --> 00:04:14,439
I wish a long life
for the newlyweds!

41
00:04:17,887 --> 00:04:23,598
If you've attended summer services
with Aaron, show your tongue, shout.

42
00:04:34,047 --> 00:04:37,039
You shouldn't be here.
-Let me in.

43
00:04:37,127 --> 00:04:40,563
Are you in faith?
-I came for my sister's wedding.

44
00:04:40,647 --> 00:04:43,764
I hope you repent in God's name.

45
00:04:43,847 --> 00:04:48,125
Could you please get her
so I can hug her and leave?

46
00:04:48,247 --> 00:04:51,637
Eeva, do you promise
not to make a scene?

47
00:04:51,727 --> 00:04:54,321
And could you wash your face?

48
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:01,758
Well.

49
00:05:02,047 --> 00:05:06,677
And thank you. At least I've got
things to tell in group therapy.

50
00:05:06,767 --> 00:05:12,205
Others have been fucked in the ass
and kept in dark cellars! Bye.

51
00:05:12,287 --> 00:05:15,279
Eeva, you're always welcome...
-Thanks!

52
00:05:18,767 --> 00:05:21,486
Let's race to the bend!

53
00:05:21,567 --> 00:05:24,764
You're no match for me!
-I'll win!

54
00:05:25,287 --> 00:05:27,721
No, you won't.

55
00:05:46,367 --> 00:05:49,325
Oh no, were you hurt?
-No...

56
00:05:49,407 --> 00:05:52,240
Don't. I'll check it.

57
00:05:55,287 --> 00:05:57,323
Oh no...

58
00:06:01,327 --> 00:06:03,363
Oh no...

59
00:06:05,287 --> 00:06:07,676
I'm no doctor but...

60
00:06:07,767 --> 00:06:10,042
Oh no.

61
00:06:10,567 --> 00:06:13,639
I see no damage here.

62
00:06:13,967 --> 00:06:15,958
Or here...

63
00:06:16,487 --> 00:06:18,682
Maria, don't.

64
00:06:25,847 --> 00:06:29,601
Oh no.
We were tempted by the Devil.

65
00:06:46,407 --> 00:06:49,638
<i>You experienced</i>
<i>a desire of the flesh.</i>

66
00:06:50,207 --> 00:06:54,246
<i>Don't be embarrassed.</i>
<i>It's perfectly normal.</i>

67
00:06:54,447 --> 00:06:57,837
You know why? Luukas?

68
00:06:58,887 --> 00:07:00,923
Raakel?

69
00:07:01,167 --> 00:07:04,443
The Archfiend is testing us.

70
00:07:05,767 --> 00:07:08,235
Exactly.

71
00:07:08,327 --> 00:07:12,957
But sexuality belongs to marriage.
You must be patient.

72
00:07:13,047 --> 00:07:17,802
What you felt
was the work of the Archfiend.

73
00:07:17,887 --> 00:07:21,880
He tries to ruin your love.

74
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:27,361
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ.

75
00:07:30,527 --> 00:07:33,405
<i>You're playing with fire, Maria.</i>

76
00:07:33,487 --> 00:07:36,684
<i>I wanted a kiss. That's not a sin.</i>

77
00:07:38,687 --> 00:07:43,556
<i>It leads to sin. -You really believe</i>
<i>that if I danced to rhythm music -</i>

78
00:07:43,647 --> 00:07:46,286
<i>I'd fall from grace?</i>

79
00:07:46,447 --> 00:07:49,439
That is playing with fire.

80
00:07:50,567 --> 00:07:53,001
I want to feel things.

81
00:07:53,687 --> 00:07:58,078
And know things.
And see things.

82
00:08:02,447 --> 00:08:05,439
Come and see the world with me.

83
00:08:06,687 --> 00:08:09,076
One summer?

84
00:08:11,887 --> 00:08:14,879
The world is a bad place.

85
00:08:15,487 --> 00:08:18,479
Are you sure?

86
00:09:33,767 --> 00:09:36,759
She's an adult
and can do what she wants.

87
00:09:36,847 --> 00:09:41,841
Maria is dear to us all.
She's being tested more than us.

88
00:09:41,967 --> 00:09:45,721
She is sensitive and impressionable.

89
00:09:45,807 --> 00:09:49,720
You always have
the best sticky buns.

90
00:09:51,047 --> 00:09:56,041
Everybody has to act with their
conscience and the word of God.

91
00:09:56,127 --> 00:09:59,756
But now so many youngsters
give up their faith.

92
00:10:01,047 --> 00:10:06,485
You, Raakel...
You could possibly help us.

93
00:10:06,567 --> 00:10:09,001
Where is Maria?

94
00:10:09,087 --> 00:10:12,921
It would be important
to get in touch with her.

95
00:10:13,007 --> 00:10:17,000
You know that Maria's family
has suffered...

96
00:10:17,327 --> 00:10:19,841
...losses.

97
00:10:23,087 --> 00:10:27,160
Raakel, answer
your uncle's question.

98
00:10:31,727 --> 00:10:34,639
I promised not to tell.

99
00:10:58,087 --> 00:11:00,396
Maria will come back.

100
00:11:00,487 --> 00:11:04,560
Fine. Let's say that
she probably will come back.

101
00:11:04,647 --> 00:11:08,435
Let's say the probability
is nine out of ten.

102
00:11:08,527 --> 00:11:12,645
Or let's say 95 out of a hundred.
-OK.

103
00:11:12,927 --> 00:11:17,523
There is still a 5% chance
that we will lose her.

104
00:11:19,247 --> 00:11:23,126
The world is a treacherous place.

105
00:11:23,247 --> 00:11:28,640
It will condemn weak souls
to eternal damnation.

106
00:11:36,647 --> 00:11:39,002
Want a lollipop?

107
00:11:45,127 --> 00:11:49,279
It is that easy to give in
to temptation in the city.

108
00:11:52,927 --> 00:11:56,806
One touch
and the Devil takes everything.

109
00:11:59,367 --> 00:12:02,439
What can I do?

110
00:12:02,527 --> 00:12:07,806
Force her to come back?
-Just hold her hand.

111
00:12:07,887 --> 00:12:10,276
Be her guardian angel.

112
00:12:10,367 --> 00:12:14,280
You'd lead the stray lamb
back to the flock.

113
00:12:14,367 --> 00:12:19,122
That's the biggest favour
you can do for a friend.

114
00:12:39,727 --> 00:12:43,003
You're a good girl.

115
00:12:43,727 --> 00:12:46,605
You will manage.

116
00:12:53,007 --> 00:12:55,919
But be careful.

117
00:14:01,007 --> 00:14:02,599
Hi.

118
00:14:03,727 --> 00:14:06,400
Did you come alone?

119
00:14:07,367 --> 00:14:08,959
Yes.

120
00:14:12,807 --> 00:14:16,925
Have you become paranoid?
-I feared it was a trap.

121
00:14:17,247 --> 00:14:19,238
Stupid.

122
00:14:23,807 --> 00:14:26,367
Good to see you.

123
00:14:39,087 --> 00:14:44,081
This place belongs to an old lady.
I saw an ad in a newspaper.

124
00:14:44,287 --> 00:14:47,120
Let's fix your bed here.

125
00:15:03,847 --> 00:15:09,638
What? -I'm afraid.

126
00:15:10,887 --> 00:15:13,640
Of what?

127
00:15:15,007 --> 00:15:17,441
That you will stay here -

128
00:15:17,527 --> 00:15:20,519
lose your faith and, think that -

129
00:15:20,647 --> 00:15:23,957
nothing matters besides yourself -

130
00:15:24,047 --> 00:15:27,483
money, things, and your looks.

131
00:15:27,567 --> 00:15:32,038
I only want to see what it's like.
-You want to try it.

132
00:15:32,127 --> 00:15:37,281
It's not that simple. Kissing
won't automatically lead to sex.

133
00:15:38,727 --> 00:15:43,437
What if you lose faith
and are damned? -I won't.

134
00:15:45,767 --> 00:15:50,079
Promise me you'll leave with me
if you become settled.

135
00:15:50,207 --> 00:15:54,644
I won't settle here.
-What if you do and are damned?

136
00:15:56,887 --> 00:16:02,007
You'll say the magic word
and I'll leave. -Shake hands on it.

137
00:16:09,127 --> 00:16:12,199
Welcome to the job.
-Thank you.

138
00:16:30,327 --> 00:16:33,797
Going to a club tonight?
-What happens there?

139
00:16:33,887 --> 00:16:36,481
We get drunk,
mess around with boys -

140
00:16:36,567 --> 00:16:40,037
dance, get pregnant and
have an abortion. The usual.

141
00:16:40,127 --> 00:16:44,279
Oh fuck, what a question.
-You sound like a hillbilly.

142
00:16:44,367 --> 00:16:46,881
Say ''fuck no'' and spit.

143
00:16:46,967 --> 00:16:50,277
Fuck no.
-Something like that.

144
00:16:50,367 --> 00:16:52,881
See ya. -See you.

145
00:16:53,247 --> 00:16:55,556
Tuuli is really cool.

146
00:16:57,127 --> 00:16:59,595
Cursing is a sin.

147
00:16:59,687 --> 00:17:04,442
Technically, the Bible forbids
saying the Lord's name in vain.

148
00:17:04,527 --> 00:17:08,406
And I didn't do that.
Come on.

149
00:17:25,967 --> 00:17:28,925
You're so cool.
-Am I?

150
00:17:37,807 --> 00:17:40,799
You want some make-up tips?

151
00:17:40,887 --> 00:17:44,960
We have a new make-up line
for youngsters.

152
00:17:45,047 --> 00:17:48,801
Come and sit down.
Come.

153
00:17:51,967 --> 00:17:56,404
A little mascara makes
your look darker, right?

154
00:18:00,687 --> 00:18:02,439
Like that.

155
00:18:02,527 --> 00:18:06,679
Sun powder makes you sparkle
and you'll be noticed.

156
00:18:08,847 --> 00:18:12,442
I'll go to the bathroom.
Order me some tea.

157
00:18:24,367 --> 00:18:27,677
Hi. What would you like to have?

158
00:18:27,767 --> 00:18:31,123
I want two of...
something alcoholic.

159
00:18:31,207 --> 00:18:33,357
What kind of?

160
00:18:34,007 --> 00:18:38,080
What would be good
for a first-timer?

161
00:18:38,167 --> 00:18:41,284
You've never drank alcohol?

162
00:18:41,367 --> 00:18:46,441
I think cider would be the best.
So, two?

163
00:18:57,407 --> 00:19:02,276
That bathroom is unbelievable.
There was a chandelier.

164
00:19:02,367 --> 00:19:06,280
I don't know if it is crystal...
-Here are the ciders.

165
00:19:19,407 --> 00:19:22,285
I like these candles.

166
00:19:27,527 --> 00:19:32,317
I'll take these back.
You should wash your face.

167
00:21:13,887 --> 00:21:16,355
Here's yours.

168
00:21:37,487 --> 00:21:40,081
There's Sunday service tomorrow.

169
00:21:40,167 --> 00:21:43,239
Shall we go?
-I'll do that back home.

170
00:21:44,367 --> 00:21:49,646
Shall we pray? -I'll ask for
forgiveness when I'm done.

171
00:21:49,727 --> 00:21:51,763
You should pray every day.

172
00:21:51,847 --> 00:21:55,840
Do I go to hell for not praying
if I die at night?

173
00:21:55,927 --> 00:22:00,796
And for other reasons.
-You pray like some crackpot.

174
00:22:00,887 --> 00:22:05,085
You pray if you accidentally
nudge some old lady.

175
00:22:10,167 --> 00:22:12,761
What on earth are you praying now?

176
00:22:12,847 --> 00:22:17,443
Some thoughts
and nudging an old lady.

177
00:22:17,767 --> 00:22:23,603
That I don't say the magic word and
drag you home. -You don't have to.

178
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:29,596
If you're going to pray,
pray for my sister Eeva.

179
00:22:29,687 --> 00:22:32,724
She's here somewhere.

180
00:22:35,567 --> 00:22:41,199
She came to the wedding,
but didn't come to see me.

181
00:22:41,287 --> 00:22:44,916
Dad said she is utterly lost.

182
00:22:47,007 --> 00:22:51,125
LAESTADIAN CHAPEL
<i>-The Archfiend tormented him.</i>

183
00:22:51,207 --> 00:22:56,884
''If you are the son of God,
turn this stone into bread.''

184
00:22:57,327 --> 00:23:01,002
Jesus said that it's been written -

185
00:23:01,127 --> 00:23:04,358
that man doesn't live
on bread alone...

186
00:23:28,727 --> 00:23:33,084
I can take your coat.
-It's not necessary.

187
00:23:36,047 --> 00:23:41,804
I was just tidying up,
putting everything in order.

188
00:23:49,247 --> 00:23:51,283
You've grown.

189
00:23:52,887 --> 00:23:56,562
Are you eighteen already?
-Yes.

190
00:24:01,727 --> 00:24:07,165
Why are you here?
-I want to see the city.

191
00:24:08,647 --> 00:24:10,842
You want a cider?

192
00:24:17,327 --> 00:24:19,716
Sit down.

193
00:24:32,007 --> 00:24:35,886
Oh, you haven't yet...
-No.

194
00:24:36,527 --> 00:24:41,396
Try it. It tastes good.

195
00:24:41,527 --> 00:24:44,405
It's made from apples.

196
00:24:45,327 --> 00:24:48,797
I remember my first time.

197
00:25:00,927 --> 00:25:05,523
There's a party tonight,
if you want to come.

198
00:25:12,087 --> 00:25:16,205
How is everything at home?
-Fine, I guess.

199
00:25:18,727 --> 00:25:23,357
Is Simeon in high school?
-In his second year.

200
00:25:25,287 --> 00:25:27,562
Oh yeah.

201
00:25:28,127 --> 00:25:30,960
Of course he is.

202
00:25:34,807 --> 00:25:38,356
We'll do the eyes first.

203
00:25:38,447 --> 00:25:43,237
Everybody will be wondering
who this beauty is.

204
00:26:13,527 --> 00:26:15,961
These are not so good.

205
00:26:16,047 --> 00:26:20,677
Look, this is beautiful.
-Give it to me.

206
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,595
Throw these away.

207
00:27:02,167 --> 00:27:07,605
Do not covet the possessions
of others. Now it's yours.

208
00:28:17,247 --> 00:28:19,397
Maria!

209
00:31:11,967 --> 00:31:13,958
A good movie.

210
00:31:18,807 --> 00:31:21,879
Have you seen other films
by this director?

211
00:31:21,967 --> 00:31:25,755
No, I haven't seen other films
by this director.

212
00:31:25,967 --> 00:31:31,246
Perhaps her finest film
will be shown here tomorrow.

213
00:31:32,007 --> 00:31:36,205
It's great. I recommend it.

214
00:32:26,807 --> 00:32:28,718
Hi.

215
00:32:37,607 --> 00:32:39,802
How about a kiss?

216
00:32:41,247 --> 00:32:42,919
What?

217
00:32:44,407 --> 00:32:47,797
Right now? -Yeah.

218
00:32:55,087 --> 00:32:57,282
Just you wait.

219
00:33:25,207 --> 00:33:28,961
Want me to teach you how to kiss?

220
00:33:55,287 --> 00:33:57,403
And where were you?

221
00:33:57,487 --> 00:34:02,163
With the girl from the factory,
Tuuli.

222
00:34:02,247 --> 00:34:06,843
What did you do?
-We talked and stuff.

223
00:34:10,887 --> 00:34:14,926
I was worried about you.
You didn't answer your phone.

224
00:34:15,007 --> 00:34:17,965
It switched off on its own.
-Sure...

225
00:34:18,047 --> 00:34:21,244
Where were you?

226
00:34:23,767 --> 00:34:29,763
Here. -Home by autumn,
get married as a virgin.

227
00:34:31,287 --> 00:34:32,879
Good night.

228
00:35:26,567 --> 00:35:28,603
Hi!

229
00:35:30,127 --> 00:35:31,765
Hi.

230
00:35:31,847 --> 00:35:35,601
I've seen that so many times
I didn't want to watch it again.

231
00:35:35,727 --> 00:35:38,560
I just came from the shop...

232
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:44,846
What was I asking..? -You were
asking if I liked the film.

233
00:35:44,927 --> 00:35:48,715
Well, did you like it?
-Yes, very much.

234
00:35:49,287 --> 00:35:53,599
I'm going to the cafe
to escape from the rain...

235
00:35:53,687 --> 00:35:56,520
Sure, let's go.

236
00:36:02,527 --> 00:36:06,202
Here you are.
I managed to get these.

237
00:36:06,447 --> 00:36:09,678
The waiter wants to go home.

238
00:36:09,767 --> 00:36:12,679
I don't blame her.

239
00:36:13,487 --> 00:36:17,162
Well, what shall we talk about?

240
00:36:17,247 --> 00:36:22,560
Actually, I did have
some kind of a plan...

241
00:36:22,647 --> 00:36:26,765
Let's get to know each other first,
then we can talk.

242
00:36:27,527 --> 00:36:30,724
How about a staring contest?
-Sure.

243
00:36:30,807 --> 00:36:33,037
You know it? -Yes.

244
00:36:33,127 --> 00:36:36,324
We'll start on three, okay?

245
00:36:36,407 --> 00:36:39,877
No looking before that.
-Or talking.

246
00:36:39,967 --> 00:36:43,676
Or talking.
-But we can make faces.

247
00:36:43,767 --> 00:36:46,964
OK. One, two, three.

248
00:36:57,127 --> 00:36:59,243
You win.

249
00:36:59,327 --> 00:37:02,558
This round.
-You were better.

250
00:37:04,207 --> 00:37:08,200
Wasn't it kinda foolish
to wait in the rain?

251
00:37:08,287 --> 00:37:12,121
No, I had a good reason.

252
00:37:14,527 --> 00:37:17,041
My name is Toni.

253
00:37:17,927 --> 00:37:21,715
Nice to have met you.

254
00:37:22,847 --> 00:37:27,284
I have to go now.
-Huh? Why?

255
00:37:28,287 --> 00:37:32,280
I have something to do.
-Wait!

256
00:37:32,367 --> 00:37:37,680
You want to see Sixties' Japanese
short films tomorrow? -Maybe.

257
00:37:37,767 --> 00:37:40,998
Please, they're interesting.
-I don't know.

258
00:38:08,647 --> 00:38:11,286
Hi.

259
00:38:17,527 --> 00:38:20,644
Have you been here
doing nothing?

260
00:38:23,047 --> 00:38:25,356
Are you sleeping?

261
00:38:26,007 --> 00:38:27,725
Yeah.

262
00:38:53,967 --> 00:38:56,356
Bye. -Bye.

263
00:38:56,847 --> 00:38:58,803
Shall we go?

264
00:39:17,327 --> 00:39:20,046
God's greetings.
-God's greetings.

265
00:39:20,127 --> 00:39:22,004
Hello.

266
00:39:22,207 --> 00:39:26,086
God's greetings, Maria.
-God's greetings.

267
00:39:27,367 --> 00:39:29,722
Want some?

268
00:39:30,047 --> 00:39:33,323
Grandma Iita's bagels.

269
00:39:34,647 --> 00:39:37,036
Thank you.

270
00:39:44,687 --> 00:39:48,600
Well?
-Nothing much to tell.

271
00:39:49,767 --> 00:39:55,239
How are things at home?
-We can't manage without you.

272
00:39:56,807 --> 00:40:01,597
A joke.
-We should go to sleep.

273
00:40:05,407 --> 00:40:08,956
Is everything okay?
-Yes.

274
00:40:09,047 --> 00:40:11,959
Really? -Yes.

275
00:40:12,487 --> 00:40:16,241
I can make coffee.
-We're out of coffee.

276
00:40:17,047 --> 00:40:19,845
Do you want a lift home?

277
00:40:23,087 --> 00:40:25,840
Maybe...
-Why don't you trust me?

278
00:40:25,927 --> 00:40:28,282
It's not about trust.

279
00:40:28,367 --> 00:40:32,121
It is dangerous to sit
at the blasphemers' table.

280
00:40:32,207 --> 00:40:34,004
God's greetings, girls.

281
00:40:34,087 --> 00:40:37,159
How are you, Maria?
-Fine, thanks.

282
00:40:37,247 --> 00:40:40,284
You haven't been to service.

283
00:40:40,367 --> 00:40:44,804
Have you enjoyed your trip?
-This place looks nice.

284
00:40:44,887 --> 00:40:48,516
This is a... busy place.

285
00:40:49,767 --> 00:40:52,361
Is everything OK?

286
00:40:57,247 --> 00:41:01,126
Go to hell,
you hypocritical bastards!

287
00:41:01,207 --> 00:41:05,041
Leave me alone! I'm fine.

288
00:41:09,967 --> 00:41:13,243
Is everything really okay?

289
00:41:14,887 --> 00:41:16,718
Yes.

290
00:41:20,927 --> 00:41:25,045
They drove 700 kilometres
just for us.

291
00:41:25,127 --> 00:41:28,642
They did it out of love.

292
00:41:30,487 --> 00:41:33,843
Here nobody cares about anything.

293
00:41:40,967 --> 00:41:43,481
What are you thinking?

294
00:41:48,567 --> 00:41:52,560
I saw Eeva. We drank alcohol.

295
00:41:57,607 --> 00:41:59,996
How did it feel?

296
00:42:04,047 --> 00:42:08,245
Like jumping or being on a swing.

297
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:12,876
Everything feels more intense.

298
00:42:12,967 --> 00:42:17,643
We went to a party too.
I kissed this dumb boy there.

299
00:42:17,727 --> 00:42:21,242
Think what could have happened.

300
00:42:21,327 --> 00:42:24,842
Nothing. It was nothing special.

301
00:42:24,927 --> 00:42:29,876
Kissing? -Yeah. Like someone
stuck a fish in my mouth.

302
00:42:29,967 --> 00:42:32,845
A fish? -Yeah.

303
00:42:32,967 --> 00:42:35,720
You don't even like fish.

304
00:42:36,407 --> 00:42:39,638
I'm sorry I lied to you.

305
00:42:39,727 --> 00:42:44,437
All your sins forgiven in the name
and blood of Christ. -Amen.

306
00:42:45,167 --> 00:42:48,318
I must also confess...
-Yes?

307
00:42:48,407 --> 00:42:50,921
I met this boy. -What?

308
00:42:51,007 --> 00:42:55,683
We went for a coffee.
But no fish or anything.

309
00:42:56,767 --> 00:43:01,079
All your sins forgiven...
if you show him to me.

310
00:43:01,167 --> 00:43:04,876
Never!
-You'd better show him.

311
00:43:05,007 --> 00:43:08,602
No. -I want to see him.

312
00:43:09,807 --> 00:43:13,595
You can stay.
I'm going somewhere else.

313
00:43:13,687 --> 00:43:16,201
Is he either one of them?

314
00:43:16,287 --> 00:43:20,519
Is he?
-Yes, but don't move.

315
00:43:20,607 --> 00:43:23,565
Hey, over here!
Raakel is here!

316
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:27,642
Come here.

317
00:43:35,087 --> 00:43:37,920
Hi. -Hello.

318
00:43:38,007 --> 00:43:40,601
Maria. -Jussi. Hi.

319
00:43:40,687 --> 00:43:43,042
Toni. Hello.

320
00:43:46,127 --> 00:43:52,077
Great that you came. -Thanks
for the loud and clear invitation.

321
00:43:59,887 --> 00:44:02,845
Do we really know each other or..?

322
00:44:02,927 --> 00:44:05,805
Well, yeah. -Not exactly.

323
00:44:05,887 --> 00:44:09,766
We don't know each other.
-But we've seen each other.

324
00:44:09,847 --> 00:44:12,919
It is complicated.
-Well?

325
00:44:13,007 --> 00:44:16,716
I asked Raakel to watch
Japanese short films.

326
00:44:16,847 --> 00:44:21,079
Japanese short films?
Damn, you're a player!

327
00:44:21,327 --> 00:44:25,115
What do you mean?
-Sorry, he's a freak. Avoid him.

328
00:44:28,487 --> 00:44:30,523
That was a joke.

329
00:44:31,447 --> 00:44:34,837
He's a good guy.

330
00:44:40,127 --> 00:44:43,324
What are you doing?
-I don't know.

331
00:44:43,407 --> 00:44:48,162
Going home, maybe eating.
-Sounds good. We'll come along.

332
00:44:48,247 --> 00:44:51,284
Lets go. Come.

333
00:44:52,327 --> 00:44:55,637
This is my place,
but Jussi sleeps here too.

334
00:44:55,807 --> 00:44:58,367
I'm like an <i>au pair.</i>

335
00:44:59,007 --> 00:45:01,726
Jussi has lived here
most of his life.

336
00:45:01,807 --> 00:45:06,676
I brought my stuff here. It's
easier than going back and forth.

337
00:45:08,127 --> 00:45:12,279
Where are your parents? -They
spend most of their time in Spain.

338
00:45:12,367 --> 00:45:14,835
They abandoned you here?

339
00:45:14,967 --> 00:45:18,676
A big house, electronics,
a car, and a swimming pool.

340
00:45:18,807 --> 00:45:21,002
Toni's life is so hard.

341
00:45:21,087 --> 00:45:25,399
Sometimes, life can be cruel.
-You guys are silly.

342
00:45:25,487 --> 00:45:27,478
You know why?

343
00:45:27,567 --> 00:45:31,526
Our noses are so big.
You know what that means?

344
00:45:31,647 --> 00:45:34,081
<i>Our</i> big noses?

345
00:45:34,207 --> 00:45:38,519
What does it mean, Toni?
-Well, that we have...

346
00:45:38,607 --> 00:45:41,075
Yes?

347
00:45:42,727 --> 00:45:45,799
Yes?
-Big feet...

348
00:45:45,887 --> 00:45:49,880
Toni is the freak
and I'm the funny one.

349
00:46:01,927 --> 00:46:04,316
Who are you?

350
00:46:05,447 --> 00:46:07,881
Nobody.

351
00:46:10,287 --> 00:46:16,999
I'm a shadow. A three-dimensional
image from another world.

352
00:46:18,447 --> 00:46:21,439
I'm not really here.

353
00:46:22,407 --> 00:46:25,046
That's a pity.

354
00:47:19,367 --> 00:47:21,801
This is my favourite music.

355
00:47:26,407 --> 00:47:31,162
This song is about a blue unicorn -

356
00:47:31,247 --> 00:47:35,525
who has escaped from his owner.

357
00:47:37,967 --> 00:47:42,677
His task is to find songs
and give them to others.

358
00:48:29,927 --> 00:48:32,236
Sorry.

359
00:48:35,247 --> 00:48:38,284
I have other music too.
-No...

360
00:48:38,567 --> 00:48:41,127
Come here.

361
00:48:44,807 --> 00:48:47,082
Come closer.

362
00:48:49,967 --> 00:48:52,925
But don't touch.

363
00:48:53,727 --> 00:48:59,120
You can't touch me
because I don't exist.

364
00:49:52,327 --> 00:49:55,285
I sleep here.

365
00:50:00,087 --> 00:50:03,762
But are no games here.

366
00:50:04,247 --> 00:50:07,478
You want to kiss me?
-Yes.

367
00:50:24,887 --> 00:50:28,084
No. -Sorry.

368
00:50:33,327 --> 00:50:37,639
Or yes. Do you want to?
-Yes.

369
00:50:37,727 --> 00:50:41,720
Should I undress now?
-That is the standard procedure.

370
00:50:41,807 --> 00:50:46,927
We could do it dressed, but it's
difficult. -Turn off the lights.

371
00:50:58,647 --> 00:51:01,764
I... -What?

372
00:51:01,887 --> 00:51:05,800
I'm a little nervous. -Why?

373
00:51:07,047 --> 00:51:11,359
I haven't... done this before.

374
00:51:11,447 --> 00:51:16,567
Is there something I can do?
-Just wait a minute.

375
00:51:16,647 --> 00:51:20,765
For what?
-For me to loosen up.

376
00:51:30,887 --> 00:51:33,879
Where is Maria?
-I don't know.

377
00:51:34,367 --> 00:51:37,279
Is she alone with Jussi?
-Probably.

378
00:51:37,367 --> 00:51:41,042
Maria! -Calm down,
he's not going to hurt her.

379
00:51:41,127 --> 00:51:43,482
We have to go.
-There's no hurry!

380
00:51:46,807 --> 00:51:50,595
A pretty good guitar,
but a little out of tune.

381
00:51:55,287 --> 00:52:00,202
I had a guitar once,
but it got broken at a party.

382
00:52:00,287 --> 00:52:07,079
How? -I was drunk and it was
out of tune so I smashed it.

383
00:52:30,287 --> 00:52:33,040
Maria!

384
00:52:34,087 --> 00:52:37,477
<i>Open the door.</i>
-Wait. I'll be there.

385
00:52:41,607 --> 00:52:44,917
Should we exchange numbers?

386
00:52:46,087 --> 00:52:51,002
We just switched operators,
we don't know our new numbers.

387
00:52:51,127 --> 00:52:55,120
But that doesn't mean
that your number changes.

388
00:52:55,767 --> 00:52:59,885
Well, we have this thing.
-This is my number.

389
00:53:01,487 --> 00:53:03,079
Thanks.

390
00:53:03,167 --> 00:53:06,364
Thanks for the food.
-Bye.

391
00:53:41,767 --> 00:53:47,080
Kissing felt really nice. -Remember
that when you burn in hell.

392
00:53:47,207 --> 00:53:50,199
What? -That's right.

393
00:53:50,287 --> 00:53:53,962
Kissing, booze, and rhythm music
are not sins.

394
00:53:54,047 --> 00:53:57,278
Do they really lead to sin?

395
00:53:57,367 --> 00:54:01,997
Fuck no. I'm clean as a whistle
now and always.

396
00:54:02,087 --> 00:54:06,638
Do you think you're stronger than
the rest? -Stronger than most!

397
00:54:06,727 --> 00:54:10,197
You're carrying a burden of guilt!

398
00:54:10,287 --> 00:54:15,680
You do what everybody else wants
and says. That's why you're weak!

399
00:56:19,967 --> 00:56:24,722
I've dreamt about India
since I was a kid. Now I'm going.

400
00:56:24,807 --> 00:56:28,516
Will you be there long?
-I don't know.

401
00:56:29,567 --> 00:56:33,480
I'll come home when
I'm out of money or home sick.

402
00:56:33,567 --> 00:56:36,161
I really don't know yet.

403
00:56:39,847 --> 00:56:45,319
Isn't it scary, not knowing?
-No, it's not.

404
00:56:47,567 --> 00:56:51,526
I'll know
after I've looked around first.

405
00:56:53,287 --> 00:56:56,597
Come with me to India.

406
00:57:00,047 --> 00:57:02,242
Wouldn't that be cool?

407
00:57:35,407 --> 00:57:39,082
I don't know anything about you.

408
00:57:39,207 --> 00:57:41,767
Where you come from.

409
00:57:41,847 --> 00:57:46,796
What your dreams are.
I don't know anything.

410
00:57:48,207 --> 00:57:51,119
I want someone
who's with me now.

411
00:57:51,207 --> 00:57:53,880
You can't be a shadow.

412
00:58:03,767 --> 00:58:07,476
You're nice.
-Why can't I touch you?

413
00:58:07,567 --> 00:58:11,401
Do you have someone else?
-That's not the point.

414
00:58:12,207 --> 00:58:15,517
But you have someone else.

415
00:58:16,767 --> 00:58:21,761
What do you want from me?
Tell me honestly.

416
00:58:21,847 --> 00:58:25,044
Answer me straight!

417
00:58:29,367 --> 00:58:33,406
Do you have your
new phone numbers?

418
00:58:34,727 --> 00:58:36,604
No.

419
00:58:37,047 --> 00:58:39,481
That's odd.

420
00:58:56,087 --> 00:58:59,238
God's greetings.
-God's greetings.

421
00:59:00,807 --> 00:59:03,605
Is something the matter?

422
00:59:10,767 --> 00:59:13,042
Tell me.

423
00:59:21,167 --> 00:59:25,365
I'm evil. -No, you're not.

424
00:59:27,447 --> 00:59:30,086
Yes, I am. -No.

425
00:59:30,167 --> 00:59:32,635
I've used make-up.

426
00:59:34,287 --> 00:59:36,881
I'm selfish -

427
00:59:38,167 --> 00:59:40,601
and weak.

428
00:59:41,327 --> 00:59:44,956
I still don't see a bad person.

429
00:59:47,167 --> 00:59:49,761
Neither does God.

430
00:59:50,607 --> 00:59:53,519
And He sees everything.

431
00:59:56,807 --> 01:00:01,517
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ.

432
01:00:11,647 --> 01:00:15,879
God's greetings.
Did you go somewhere? -No.

433
01:00:15,967 --> 01:00:19,198
You've just been here?
-Yes.

434
01:00:20,287 --> 01:00:23,757
I was with Eeva,
we had some drinks.

435
01:00:23,847 --> 01:00:26,998
Magic word. -What?

436
01:00:27,087 --> 01:00:29,203
Let's go home. -Why?

437
01:00:29,287 --> 01:00:34,520
You promised we'd go when I say it.
-If I was going out of control.

438
01:00:34,647 --> 01:00:37,923
You drank again today.
-So?

439
01:00:38,007 --> 01:00:41,158
You mean, I'm going to hell?

440
01:00:41,287 --> 01:00:45,360
Yes, that's how it begins.
Where are you going?

441
01:00:45,447 --> 01:00:50,237
To take heroin and sell my body.
By the way, nice mascara.

442
01:00:53,007 --> 01:00:56,283
What are you afraid of?
Come, I'll show you.

443
01:00:56,367 --> 01:01:00,963
Please, don't. -You were
assigned to protect me.

444
01:01:06,767 --> 01:01:09,042
Here's the den of sin.

445
01:01:13,087 --> 01:01:17,319
I wasn't told to take care of you.
I wanted to come.

446
01:01:17,407 --> 01:01:23,357
And I'm Jesus Christ.
Look at me, it's still me.

447
01:01:24,007 --> 01:01:29,400
Can we go now? -You have to taste
it. You have to understand all this.

448
01:01:29,487 --> 01:01:34,402
Well, what is all this?
-Nothing. Ordinary life. Taste it.

449
01:01:34,567 --> 01:01:39,402
We didn't order anything.
-A gift from those gentlemen.

450
01:02:07,247 --> 01:02:10,045
You want Toni to screw you.

451
01:02:10,807 --> 01:02:15,801
Don't... -You're a bad believer.
You're so fucking bad.

452
01:02:15,887 --> 01:02:17,764
You know why?

453
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:23,285
You don't know where Satan lives.
Here. I've always known it.

454
01:02:23,367 --> 01:02:27,599
I feel how he moves,
it feels wonderful!

455
01:02:27,687 --> 01:02:31,282
But I won't give him anything!

456
01:02:31,367 --> 01:02:36,043
You think Satan isn't in you.
That's why he can take you.

457
01:02:36,767 --> 01:02:41,682
Why the look? Fucking bad believer!
You want Toni to screw you.

458
01:02:41,767 --> 01:02:44,076
You'll burn in hell,
I'll go to Heaven!

459
01:02:49,687 --> 01:02:53,077
Is everything alright?
-Yes. Throwing up helped.

460
01:02:53,167 --> 01:02:57,240
Good. In Finland we have
these teen whores.

461
01:02:57,327 --> 01:03:02,003
Will you abandon me
or do as you're told? Well?

462
01:04:42,007 --> 01:04:43,998
An angel.

463
01:04:44,807 --> 01:04:46,798
No.

464
01:04:47,607 --> 01:04:51,600
I'll give you a hint.
He lives in the jungle.

465
01:04:51,927 --> 01:04:55,237
No, you're a real angel.

466
01:04:55,487 --> 01:04:58,047
Forgive me.

467
01:04:59,967 --> 01:05:02,720
It was a monkey.

468
01:05:02,807 --> 01:05:05,719
Monkey on your back.

469
01:05:05,847 --> 01:05:09,806
Like a millstone around one's neck.

470
01:05:11,727 --> 01:05:15,197
Good night.
-Good night.

471
01:05:37,487 --> 01:05:40,923
I dropped my purse there.

472
01:05:41,327 --> 01:05:45,684
Calm down. -Don't you understand,
they'll come here!

473
01:05:45,767 --> 01:05:49,806
Don't exaggerate. -I dropped
my purse! They can find us!

474
01:05:49,967 --> 01:05:53,323
We have to go!
Get dressed, we can't stay here.

475
01:06:14,287 --> 01:06:16,721
You need a drink.

476
01:06:25,127 --> 01:06:27,516
Have some.
-No, thanks.

477
01:06:27,607 --> 01:06:30,758
Yes, you will.
My house, my rules.

478
01:06:30,847 --> 01:06:35,477
We drink booze,
or you get the fuck out of here.

479
01:06:38,047 --> 01:06:41,119
At least remove that crucifix.

480
01:06:42,327 --> 01:06:46,161
We have a situation.
Can we stay the night?

481
01:06:48,567 --> 01:06:51,957
You're always welcome
if you're drunk.

482
01:06:54,967 --> 01:07:00,121
That was a joke.
Of course you can stay.

483
01:07:00,207 --> 01:07:04,917
Jesus loves you. -You know
what kind of Christ I know?

484
01:07:07,087 --> 01:07:13,640
You're a fucking coward.
You can't even look at me.

485
01:07:13,727 --> 01:07:16,958
What the fuck are you afraid of?
Satan?

486
01:07:17,047 --> 01:07:20,960
Or that you know
how screwed up that system is!

487
01:07:21,047 --> 01:07:23,277
Laura, come here!

488
01:07:23,767 --> 01:07:27,442
She's my lesbian lover.
Does it bother you?

489
01:07:27,527 --> 01:07:32,282
Oh yeah, she's not even human,
because Jesus doesn't love her -

490
01:07:32,367 --> 01:07:36,155
since she screws girls!
-I'll pray for you.

491
01:07:36,247 --> 01:07:40,604
Don't you ever fucking pray for me!

492
01:07:42,607 --> 01:07:44,802
You can stay.

493
01:08:12,367 --> 01:08:14,517
Hi.

494
01:08:14,807 --> 01:08:18,197
Can we stay the night?
-Is something the matter?

495
01:08:18,287 --> 01:08:22,519
No. -Come inside.
You can use the sauna if you want.

496
01:08:45,127 --> 01:08:50,485
Summer services start soon.
-Yeah.

497
01:10:00,687 --> 01:10:03,804
I'm from Northern Ostrobothnia.

498
01:10:05,767 --> 01:10:10,887
I'm 1 8 and the eldest sibling.

499
01:10:14,207 --> 01:10:19,679
The others are Iida, Ariel,
Eleonoora, Helena -

500
01:10:19,767 --> 01:10:23,237
Lars, Leevi, Tuomas, Ruut -

501
01:10:23,327 --> 01:10:28,037
Martta, Jaacob, Esaias and Ellen.
-OK.

502
01:10:29,207 --> 01:10:32,244
I believe in God.

503
01:10:36,567 --> 01:10:39,923
I'm a Conservative Laestadian.

504
01:10:41,567 --> 01:10:44,081
How does it feel?

505
01:10:49,927 --> 01:10:52,361
Great.

506
01:10:54,687 --> 01:10:57,759
Why couldn't you tell me?

507
01:11:03,287 --> 01:11:06,165
Because you would've left.

508
01:11:12,167 --> 01:11:14,840
I wouldn't have.

509
01:11:16,127 --> 01:11:20,245
You could be from Southern
Ostrobothnia for all I care.

510
01:11:33,007 --> 01:11:35,919
Who are you?
-I don't know.

511
01:11:36,007 --> 01:11:42,480
At least not yet.
A human, a curious human.

512
01:11:43,287 --> 01:11:45,801
How does it feel?

513
01:11:48,247 --> 01:11:51,125
It feels really good.

514
01:12:49,887 --> 01:12:51,764
What?

515
01:13:48,367 --> 01:13:50,119
No.

516
01:13:55,287 --> 01:13:57,881
No, no...

517
01:14:04,807 --> 01:14:09,278
Raakel, I can't feel my faith.
I will go to hell!

518
01:14:11,047 --> 01:14:15,120
What's the matter?
-I have to get out of here!

519
01:14:21,487 --> 01:14:25,321
Let go! -Calm down!

520
01:14:25,447 --> 01:14:28,757
Let go! -Calm down.

521
01:14:49,847 --> 01:14:52,202
Calm down.

522
01:15:35,527 --> 01:15:38,121
She's not here. Maria!

523
01:15:46,327 --> 01:15:48,443
Here!

524
01:15:56,567 --> 01:16:00,162
I'm filthy! I'm filthy!

525
01:16:02,967 --> 01:16:06,676
I can't feel my faith!

526
01:16:08,927 --> 01:16:11,043
Calm down.

527
01:16:11,527 --> 01:16:15,884
You're suffering a minor shock,
you'll remain under observation.

528
01:16:15,967 --> 01:16:19,846
A nurse will take care of
your scratch.

529
01:16:38,047 --> 01:16:40,800
Say the magic word.

530
01:16:45,687 --> 01:16:48,155
Say it.

531
01:16:49,567 --> 01:16:52,240
You promised.

532
01:17:02,247 --> 01:17:04,681
Raakel?

533
01:17:09,647 --> 01:17:11,763
Say it.

534
01:17:30,567 --> 01:17:32,876
Raakel...

535
01:18:46,847 --> 01:18:50,886
Toni, no.
I don't want to take it off.

536
01:19:38,887 --> 01:19:41,879
There's fire -

537
01:19:42,247 --> 01:19:44,966
and water.

538
01:19:45,167 --> 01:19:48,443
Together they make ash.

539
01:19:50,767 --> 01:19:55,238
Fire is good, water is good.

540
01:19:58,047 --> 01:20:00,845
Ash is nothing.

541
01:20:49,327 --> 01:20:51,682
TO SUMMER SERVICES

542
01:20:51,927 --> 01:20:57,399
<i>People living in the Archfiend's</i>
<i>world don't want to believe -</i>

543
01:20:57,487 --> 01:21:01,480
<i>that their sins are forgiven.</i>

544
01:21:02,607 --> 01:21:06,600
<i>People are either for Christ</i>
<i>or against him.</i>

545
01:21:06,687 --> 01:21:09,565
<i>Jesus means that...</i>

546
01:21:15,287 --> 01:21:21,283
We are all evil. The domain
of the Archfiend tempts us.

547
01:21:21,487 --> 01:21:27,881
We God's children are tempted by all
the useless things we don't need.

548
01:21:27,967 --> 01:21:31,562
We're all weak and sinners.

549
01:21:31,687 --> 01:21:36,397
All of us think
that our sins are unique -

550
01:21:36,487 --> 01:21:38,955
but they're not!

551
01:21:39,087 --> 01:21:43,205
The gift of faith in our hearts
is based solely -

552
01:21:43,287 --> 01:21:47,075
on the deeds of our Saviour,
Jesus Christ.

553
01:21:47,207 --> 01:21:51,041
He gave his life
to redeem our sins.

554
01:21:51,127 --> 01:21:54,039
To redeem our sins.

555
01:21:54,127 --> 01:21:58,120
He is the refuge and sanctuary
who guides us.

556
01:21:59,687 --> 01:22:01,803
You may believe.

557
01:22:01,887 --> 01:22:05,721
Brothers, sisters, and friends,
your sins are forgiven.

558
01:22:07,607 --> 01:22:11,680
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ.

559
01:22:12,687 --> 01:22:17,761
All your sins forgiven in the name
and blood of Christ, my dear child!

560
01:22:17,847 --> 01:22:23,558
All your sins forgiven in the name
and expiatory blood of Christ.

561
01:22:23,647 --> 01:22:29,882
All your sins forgiven in the name
and precious blood of Christ!

562
01:22:29,967 --> 01:22:34,438
All your sins forgiven
in the name and blood of Christ!

563
01:22:35,127 --> 01:22:40,963
All your sins forgiven in the name
and expiatory blood of Christ...

564
01:23:48,007 --> 01:23:50,646
It'll rain soon.

565
01:23:50,727 --> 01:23:54,561
Where are you going?
-Come.

566
01:24:30,007 --> 01:24:31,998
Close your eyes.

567
01:24:37,647 --> 01:24:39,638
Do it.

568
01:25:01,807 --> 01:25:04,275
You smell nice.

569
01:25:04,367 --> 01:25:06,517
Raakel, don't.

570
01:25:10,327 --> 01:25:13,603
No one will see us.

571
01:26:00,567 --> 01:26:05,516
God, please forgive Raakel
for her actions -

572
01:26:05,607 --> 01:26:09,236
and forgive me for my weak flesh.

573
01:26:09,327 --> 01:26:12,285
Please forgive Raakel
for her actions.

574
01:27:38,967 --> 01:27:41,356
Jesus Christ!

575
01:27:41,567 --> 01:27:44,957
Raakel, what did you do?

576
01:27:46,527 --> 01:27:49,200
Go wash up at once!

577
01:28:03,807 --> 01:28:09,359
You will not sit at my table
looking like that. Go!

578
01:28:11,887 --> 01:28:15,357
<i>Dear God, bless and protect us.</i>

579
01:28:15,527 --> 01:28:21,443
<i>Bless and protect Raakel also,</i>
<i>and forgive her for being weak.</i>

580
01:29:43,487 --> 01:29:45,637
God's greetings.

581
01:29:46,367 --> 01:29:48,597
God's greetings, Raakel.

582
01:29:49,007 --> 01:29:51,521
God's greetings.

583
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,365
God's greetings.

584
01:30:02,967 --> 01:30:05,606
So...

585
01:30:05,727 --> 01:30:09,197
We wanted to see, Raakel -

586
01:30:10,447 --> 01:30:14,156
if everything is alright.

587
01:30:49,327 --> 01:30:51,557
Wait a moment.

588
01:30:52,487 --> 01:30:57,197
I figured there would be
a lost lamb on the move.

589
01:31:18,287 --> 01:31:21,643
I could make some porridge.

590
01:31:21,727 --> 01:31:24,480
That's not necessary.

591
01:31:25,047 --> 01:31:29,882
Remember to eat something
on the way.

592
01:31:29,967 --> 01:31:33,198
You're so skinny.

593
01:31:33,287 --> 01:31:35,847
You have to eat.

594
01:31:36,487 --> 01:31:39,081
You hear me?

595
01:31:50,007 --> 01:31:52,316
Bye bye.

596
01:31:56,087 --> 01:32:00,956
It feels horrible
that my own child will burn in hell.

597
01:32:04,327 --> 01:32:06,557
Bye bye.
