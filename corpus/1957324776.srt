1
00:00:11,225 --> 00:00:13,894
[narrator] Seeing that we all
already know in order to debate

2
00:00:15,521 --> 00:00:18,274
ancient and ardent
question: does God exist?

3
00:00:19,608 --> 00:00:23,571
There is perhaps no more contentious
issue that we could consider.

4
00:00:24,280 --> 00:00:26,680
[different narrator] Agnostic
astronomer Robert Jestrell said

5
00:00:26,782 --> 00:00:29,302
[loud gong rings] ...astronomers
now find themselves in a corner

6
00:00:29,452 --> 00:00:32,431
because they have proven by their own
methods that the world became abruptly and

7
00:00:32,455 --> 00:00:35,166
and at which you can
trace the seeds of every star

8
00:00:35,291 --> 00:00:39,754
every planet, every living thing
on... in this cosmos and on earth.

9
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:41,440
And they have found
all this has happened

10
00:00:41,464 --> 00:00:44,133
as a product of forces they
did not hope to discover.

11
00:00:44,383 --> 00:00:46,695
[gong] [narrator changes] If
he says no persuasive argument

12
00:00:46,719 --> 00:00:50,181
for the existence of god has
ever been advanced or produced

13
00:00:50,348 --> 00:00:52,558
without convincing [gong]

14
00:00:52,641 --> 00:00:56,896
no argument in favor stands has
been proven without a doubt, [gong]

15
00:00:57,021 --> 00:00:59,440
or to stand the testimony...

16
00:00:59,565 --> 00:01:01,734
[from the back ground]
Nothing... There was no god...

17
00:01:01,984 --> 00:01:05,029
[gong] [from the distance]
there was no vacuum

18
00:01:05,154 --> 00:01:08,115
there was no twirling mathematical...
[speech drowned by a gong]

19
00:01:08,282 --> 00:01:10,409
doctor Jestrell
has said from Oxford.

20
00:01:10,534 --> 00:01:11,994
There was nothing.

21
00:01:12,078 --> 00:01:14,330
[another narrator] There
is no explanation [gong]

22
00:01:14,455 --> 00:01:18,125
for the origins of our species,
for the origins of our cosmos,

23
00:01:18,292 --> 00:01:22,922
for the origins of own selves,
there is not one explanation left

24
00:01:23,047 --> 00:01:26,634
which requires existence...
[gong and traffic noise]

25
00:01:26,717 --> 00:01:29,655
Do you know that they keep on saying
that the human brain has the same elements?

26
00:01:29,679 --> 00:01:33,891
Why are some carbon based molecules
conscientious and others are not?

27
00:01:34,225 --> 00:01:38,104
If we are just molecules in motion,
how do we have human freedom?

28
00:01:38,187 --> 00:01:39,897
William Cornwall from Cornell

29
00:01:40,022 --> 00:01:43,943
He is a materialistic Darwinist, he points
out that we don't have any human freedom.

30
00:01:44,068 --> 00:01:48,364
If all we are, is molecules
in motion. [religious chanting]

31
00:01:48,531 --> 00:01:52,034
[different narrator] Of course Darwin used
creationist interviews, he actually says...

32
00:01:52,243 --> 00:01:58,833
[chanting]
[unintelligible speech]

33
00:01:59,792 --> 00:02:04,255
Einstein, he used god
imagines when he spoke...

34
00:02:04,839 --> 00:02:08,592
Of the extraordinary
majesty... [loud music]

35
00:02:14,348 --> 00:02:16,308
How could you even think
of giving such a lecture?

36
00:02:17,560 --> 00:02:20,855
On basic principles of
quantum theory, that's how.

37
00:02:23,065 --> 00:02:26,986
[suspenseful music]

38
00:02:27,236 --> 00:02:30,823
[prayer drowned by music]

39
00:02:36,787 --> 00:02:39,182
[Noel] You are putting all of
us in a very vulnerable position.

40
00:02:39,206 --> 00:02:40,249
[Jeanine] Really?

41
00:02:41,375 --> 00:02:46,505
[Noel] Denying the existence of god might
be a bit offensive to Monsignor Bastini.

42
00:02:47,506 --> 00:02:49,508
My research will finally
provide the answer.

43
00:02:49,759 --> 00:02:51,719
- Will it, really?
- Yes.

44
00:02:54,138 --> 00:02:56,474
What are looking for, has
already been answered.

45
00:02:56,807 --> 00:02:59,852
Really? What scientific
journal might I find that answer?

46
00:03:00,061 --> 00:03:01,312
In the Holy Books.

47
00:03:01,937 --> 00:03:05,900
- [Noel] Far beyond your scientific journals.
- [Jeanine] Again, the god bit.

48
00:03:06,025 --> 00:03:07,526
Oh, slow down.

49
00:03:07,735 --> 00:03:11,155
I thought you like
it, my god, you bet!

50
00:03:11,322 --> 00:03:15,534
God, no! Nothing's up there guiding
us, or eternalizing, or protecting us.

51
00:03:15,868 --> 00:03:17,119
Nothing, it's just us.

52
00:03:17,286 --> 00:03:19,526
[Laura] Hands on the wheel,
please! Mum, leave him alone!

53
00:03:19,705 --> 00:03:21,865
[Noel] How are you ever
going to convince the faithful,

54
00:03:21,957 --> 00:03:23,834
when you can't even
convince your own family?

55
00:03:23,918 --> 00:03:28,422
[Jeanine] I research through science, all
will soon realize this centuries old hoax.

56
00:03:28,631 --> 00:03:32,510
All history is god's, but Roman, Greek and
Egyptian are on mythologies rubbish heap

57
00:03:32,718 --> 00:03:35,304
and your god, your Christ, no?

58
00:03:35,471 --> 00:03:36,931
Is this conversation necessary?

59
00:03:37,098 --> 00:03:38,265
Listen to your music.

60
00:03:38,891 --> 00:03:40,935
Your so called scientific proof.

61
00:03:43,646 --> 00:03:44,897
[Noel] Are you ready?

62
00:03:45,815 --> 00:03:47,608
[Jeanine] The
self-existing dimension.

63
00:03:47,858 --> 00:03:50,194
[Noel] There is no such
thing as self existed.

64
00:03:50,319 --> 00:03:51,737
Everything has to
have a beginning!

65
00:03:51,946 --> 00:03:55,366
An unimaginable explosion of a
self-existing gravitational dimension.

66
00:03:55,491 --> 00:03:59,203
From the galaxies, planets,
dinosaurs, cockroaches, eventually us.

67
00:03:59,286 --> 00:04:00,454
Out of nothing.

68
00:04:01,247 --> 00:04:03,708
[narrator] Actually he wrote the

69
00:04:03,999 --> 00:04:05,918
[Noel] Always
was, always will be.

70
00:04:06,002 --> 00:04:08,522
[Laura] Mum, please stop
distracting, I'll be late for the game.

71
00:04:08,587 --> 00:04:11,632
You still have nothing to show
for your misguided research.

72
00:04:11,757 --> 00:04:13,884
Ah, Misguided? Because
I use my own mind?

73
00:04:14,010 --> 00:04:17,013
Exposing our daughter
to your atheistic absurdity!

74
00:04:18,931 --> 00:04:20,808
One must find her own answers.

75
00:04:20,975 --> 00:04:23,561
The only answer!
God.

76
00:04:24,478 --> 00:04:26,397
The answer isn't god!

77
00:04:26,939 --> 00:04:28,024
Really?

78
00:04:28,983 --> 00:04:30,985
Then what about
your lecture tomorrow?

79
00:04:31,944 --> 00:04:33,779
I would be careful
with that answer.

80
00:04:34,780 --> 00:04:37,867
My student just might give you a not
so gentle shove through gates of hell

81
00:04:39,076 --> 00:04:42,371
I will take hell if there was one,
to open their eyes to the truth.

82
00:04:52,715 --> 00:04:54,675
No-oo

83
00:04:56,385 --> 00:04:57,928
[tires screeching]

84
00:05:00,473 --> 00:05:01,515
[crashing glass]

85
00:05:06,187 --> 00:05:10,566
[voice] Bastini just might give a
not gentle shove to the gates of hell

86
00:05:10,670 --> 00:05:12,714
Closed my eyes to the truth.

87
00:05:13,194 --> 00:05:15,654
[loud sounds]

88
00:05:18,166 --> 00:05:20,042
- It's not her dead husband?
- Yeah

89
00:05:22,837 --> 00:05:27,133
Yes, a self-existing gravitational
dimension of such complexity

90
00:05:27,299 --> 00:05:29,969
that it avoided
detection, until now.

91
00:05:30,678 --> 00:05:32,096
Hawking's research?

92
00:05:32,221 --> 00:05:34,140
His, also my own.

93
00:05:34,390 --> 00:05:36,851
Hawking's conclusion's
unproven nonsense.

94
00:05:37,018 --> 00:05:38,644
[a student] Exactly,
what about Lennox?

95
00:05:39,020 --> 00:05:41,606
Professor of advanced
mathematics at Oxford who called

96
00:05:41,689 --> 00:05:44,317
Hawking's research something
out of Alice in Wonderland.

97
00:05:44,442 --> 00:05:45,485
[laughter]

98
00:05:45,610 --> 00:05:48,488
Oxford has been known to
produce a looser every now and then.

99
00:05:48,613 --> 00:05:49,989
[the class] whoa!

100
00:05:50,198 --> 00:05:52,318
Surely, it's all a matter
of one's perspective, isn't?

101
00:05:52,575 --> 00:05:53,743
Absolutely not.

102
00:05:53,993 --> 00:05:57,330
If it was matter of one's perspective,
there would be too many variables.

103
00:05:57,705 --> 00:06:02,293
Truth, however, is truth. I'm sorry I don't
recognize you. Are you registered for my class?

104
00:06:02,502 --> 00:06:06,714
I'm just auditing. Self-existence
and all that, is mind bugling

105
00:06:07,381 --> 00:06:11,052
I'm actually majoring in Medieval
History. I'm signed to professor Algada.

106
00:06:11,594 --> 00:06:12,595
Rinaldo.

107
00:06:13,846 --> 00:06:16,557
Then you may audit.
Tell him I said 'hello'.

108
00:06:17,141 --> 00:06:18,518
Now, where was I?

109
00:06:18,684 --> 00:06:21,771
[a student] One truth
and only one. And it's God.

110
00:06:22,021 --> 00:06:23,147
[the class] Yeah!

111
00:06:23,231 --> 00:06:25,775
This is a class on
astro-physical science, isn't it?

112
00:06:25,983 --> 00:06:28,694
So, let's get back to the realities
of astro-physics, shall we?

113
00:06:28,903 --> 00:06:32,490
-God, Jesus Christ is our
reality, professor. [class] Yeah!

114
00:06:32,657 --> 00:06:37,578
A lot of disagreements with your reality.
Disagreements which has lead to centuries of bloodshed.

115
00:06:37,870 --> 00:06:39,630
I don't see any blood
shed in our class room.

116
00:06:39,664 --> 00:06:41,707
Not yet. [class laughs]

117
00:06:41,916 --> 00:06:45,962
How funny. Come to think about it, the
competition between science and religion is

118
00:06:46,128 --> 00:06:47,672
sort of like 'track meet'.

119
00:06:47,776 --> 00:06:50,883
[students] oh, come on!
- [Jeanine] Why not? 1500 meter relay.

120
00:06:51,134 --> 00:06:54,762
For team science we have Madam
Curie, Max Planck, Niels Bohr,

121
00:06:54,846 --> 00:06:56,722
Albert Einstein,
Stephen Hawking,

122
00:06:56,931 --> 00:07:00,059
Ah, Hawking's a cripple. That
guy can't even walk, let alone run.

123
00:07:00,476 --> 00:07:01,727
[laughter]

124
00:07:01,811 --> 00:07:06,065
Da Vinci, first name Leonardo,
substituting for Hawking.

125
00:07:06,274 --> 00:07:08,067
God has his own relay team.

126
00:07:08,276 --> 00:07:11,404
Exactly. He's been winning
the big ones for centuries.

127
00:07:11,654 --> 00:07:13,781
- [class] Yeah!
- God's relay team, okay.

128
00:07:13,906 --> 00:07:17,201
I happened to have taken a number
of courses on the history of Catholicism

129
00:07:17,326 --> 00:07:19,996
as an undergraduate at
St. Catherine the Divine

130
00:07:20,204 --> 00:07:24,792
Big tip on Papal infallibility, so let's give
God's advocates their best shot, shall we?

131
00:07:25,001 --> 00:07:28,713
- [Jeanine] A team of infallible popes.
- [students] Ahh

132
00:07:28,921 --> 00:07:31,340
Be careful, professor. This
is St. Genesius, remember.

133
00:07:32,425 --> 00:07:33,426
Who can forget.

134
00:07:33,593 --> 00:07:36,679
[Jeanine] OK, so here we go.
So a team of infallible popes.

135
00:07:36,762 --> 00:07:39,765
At the start I'm leading
Alexander the sixth,

136
00:07:39,932 --> 00:07:42,226
who enjoyed fornicating
with the sisters of Dorothy,

137
00:07:42,477 --> 00:07:45,917
Next the baton goes to August of Damascus
the first, who forced nuns into prostitution.

138
00:07:46,189 --> 00:07:49,442
Damascus then handed the
baton over to Benedict the ninth,

139
00:07:49,567 --> 00:07:51,235
who enjoyed sodomizing animals.

140
00:07:51,402 --> 00:07:54,447
And tearing up the tract we have nine
others, who... [students banging desks]

141
00:07:54,614 --> 00:07:57,200
decorated his house with
sculptures of... [banging continues]

142
00:07:57,283 --> 00:07:59,577
sodomizing young boys

143
00:08:00,495 --> 00:08:04,165
[siren]

144
00:08:05,500 --> 00:08:11,047
[melancholy music]

145
00:08:13,633 --> 00:08:15,843
[voice of Jeanine]
So here we go...

146
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:21,474
[chanting music]

147
00:08:23,810 --> 00:08:27,647
[sirens] [lecture noise
in the back ground]

148
00:08:35,321 --> 00:08:40,868
[suspenseful music]

149
00:08:46,249 --> 00:08:47,583
[siren]

150
00:09:03,266 --> 00:09:04,976
[silent]

151
00:09:07,562 --> 00:09:09,605
I'm sorry

152
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:15,862
[Jeanine] God, god competing
with science in never ending conflict.

153
00:09:16,279 --> 00:09:18,030
It's you science that
created the conflict.

154
00:09:18,197 --> 00:09:21,659
Wrong, Chandler, science is truth
but being plumped with a conflict

155
00:09:21,784 --> 00:09:25,788
since you are a little babe, it's now hard
to accept the truth, the truth of science.

156
00:09:25,955 --> 00:09:28,249
Our God, our Christ are myths?

157
00:09:28,374 --> 00:09:32,086
Of course not. Our faith in
the resurrection of Jesus Christ

158
00:09:32,211 --> 00:09:35,173
provides us with truth.
The truth of everlasting life.

159
00:09:35,673 --> 00:09:38,843
Sorry dear students, but
everlasting life is not a reality.

160
00:09:38,968 --> 00:09:42,305
It is nothing, but wishful dream
grounded in irrational fear of death.

161
00:09:42,555 --> 00:09:48,019
Believe in God in the resurrection of his
son, Jesus Christ is not a wishful dream.

162
00:09:48,186 --> 00:09:50,104
All protection for you Chandler

163
00:09:50,188 --> 00:09:53,483
Before long your god will be in the
same mythological bed of quick sand

164
00:09:53,566 --> 00:09:56,402
as Dina Ballantor and that
character with horns and fork tail.

165
00:09:56,986 --> 00:09:59,947
Oh Gosh, all
mythology is rubbish.

166
00:10:00,364 --> 00:10:03,701
How can you reconcile placing
God in mythology's rubbish heap?

167
00:10:04,785 --> 00:10:07,497
Not believing in the after
life, after the accident.

168
00:10:08,080 --> 00:10:11,042
[cars screeching]

169
00:10:13,336 --> 00:10:16,547
As hard as it may be, on our
death, we become nothing.

170
00:10:17,173 --> 00:10:19,884
Fertilizers for the earth, for
deciduous daisies and shrubs.

171
00:10:22,678 --> 00:10:24,680
Lunches for beetles,

172
00:10:26,182 --> 00:10:29,560
[Jeanine] No heaven nor hell

173
00:10:31,813 --> 00:10:35,024
just fertilize our lunches.

174
00:10:46,035 --> 00:10:48,704
Your focus of today's lecture

175
00:10:48,871 --> 00:10:51,249
[Jeanine] On a physical
realities of our cosmos.

176
00:10:51,791 --> 00:10:55,670
These are true realities,
I confront them dearly.

177
00:11:00,424 --> 00:11:02,301
I'm sorry, monsignor,

178
00:11:11,561 --> 00:11:12,728
Tell me,

179
00:11:14,564 --> 00:11:16,816
Do you find it satisfying

180
00:11:17,692 --> 00:11:19,986
To refuse godly principles
concerning the cosmos,

181
00:11:20,236 --> 00:11:22,446
in the impressionable
minds of our youngsters,

182
00:11:22,905 --> 00:11:26,784
I do what's required in my position as
a professor of astro-physical science,

183
00:11:26,868 --> 00:11:30,288
but wouldn't you rather
discuss this in private?

184
00:11:30,413 --> 00:11:31,873
I can dismiss my students.

185
00:11:31,998 --> 00:11:36,294
Madam, St. Genesius stands as a
holy bastion of truth and openness.

186
00:11:36,419 --> 00:11:38,546
Students, stay!

187
00:11:43,718 --> 00:11:46,518
[Jeanine] Of course. How can I be
further assistance to you, Monsignor?

188
00:11:46,554 --> 00:11:49,390
I will be reviewing one of the
university's most noted programs.

189
00:11:49,849 --> 00:11:52,143
Yours, professor Markham.

190
00:11:52,977 --> 00:11:54,687
[Jeanine] An
undeserved compliment.

191
00:12:00,985 --> 00:12:05,031
There are the foundations, whose generous
donations have fueled your research projects

192
00:12:05,490 --> 00:12:09,619
Only upon the academic statue of St. Eugene's
enabled by your leadership, Monsignor.

193
00:12:10,786 --> 00:12:13,122
We'll be a curious
servant of God.

194
00:12:13,331 --> 00:12:16,501
I recently had my assistant checking
into the backgrounds of your supporters.

195
00:12:16,709 --> 00:12:19,795
All such is filed on university's
grants and contracts office.

196
00:12:19,921 --> 00:12:23,758
Yes, but I'm still involved in opening our
students minds to the eternal glory of God.

197
00:12:23,966 --> 00:12:28,137
Sometimes the financial dealings
of the faculty just slip by me.

198
00:12:28,763 --> 00:12:31,832
Had I known, I would have sent
all copies directly to your office.

199
00:12:31,891 --> 00:12:37,063
Here we are, oh, a considerable
grant to you, Professor Markham.

200
00:12:37,271 --> 00:12:42,944
From the National Free
Though Society for your research.

201
00:12:43,694 --> 00:12:45,613
And I quote

202
00:12:45,696 --> 00:12:51,035
'On the Determination of
the Natural Origins of Life. '

203
00:12:53,412 --> 00:12:55,748
Natural origins.

204
00:12:56,958 --> 00:13:00,336
That particular research was for
reaching conclusions on strength of theory.

205
00:13:00,545 --> 00:13:04,090
So nothing to do for offering St. Genesius
adherence to the commandments of God?

206
00:13:04,799 --> 00:13:06,342
I wouldn't put it that way.

207
00:13:06,467 --> 00:13:08,469
Oh, no, oh well.

208
00:13:08,803 --> 00:13:11,514
I am known to making a
mistake every now and then.

209
00:13:14,142 --> 00:13:18,980
But here. Another grant
to our professor Markham.

210
00:13:21,274 --> 00:13:24,944
We have a research into
ethical origins [laughs] now.

211
00:13:25,069 --> 00:13:28,364
From the Jeffersonian
Humanist Foundation.

212
00:13:28,573 --> 00:13:30,324
The Jeffersonian
is the most known...

213
00:13:30,408 --> 00:13:33,619
That Jeffersonian designation,
would that like any chance refer

214
00:13:33,786 --> 00:13:35,788
to former President
Thomas Jefferson?

215
00:13:36,205 --> 00:13:37,582
I believe it does.

216
00:13:37,748 --> 00:13:43,171
Yes, well. Remembering my early priestly studies
on satanic influences and world governments

217
00:13:43,546 --> 00:13:46,924
wasn't Mr. Jefferson
the most notable atheist?

218
00:13:47,550 --> 00:13:50,928
Or does my memory serve
me correctly, professor?

219
00:13:51,220 --> 00:13:52,805
I should have refused the grant?

220
00:13:52,889 --> 00:13:55,349
An open question,
you tell me, will you?

221
00:13:55,558 --> 00:13:59,395
Silence!

222
00:14:04,150 --> 00:14:09,906
Madam, if you please,
the benefit to our students

223
00:14:12,033 --> 00:14:15,745
It funded various student research
projects and made appearance in.

224
00:14:15,953 --> 00:14:19,582
But on another note, monsignor,
and I mean this most respectfully.

225
00:14:19,707 --> 00:14:22,376
I would have appreciate if you
would refer to me as 'professor'

226
00:14:22,460 --> 00:14:25,880
or if you prefer as 'doctor' upon
my PhD on astro-physical sciences.

227
00:14:26,047 --> 00:14:28,549
I deeply appreciate the
omission of the word 'Madam'

228
00:14:28,758 --> 00:14:32,053
What do you see as your
role here St. Genesius?

229
00:14:32,220 --> 00:14:35,014
To give my students the basic
understanding of scientific principle.

230
00:14:35,181 --> 00:14:37,725
And the purpose behind
the scientific principles?

231
00:14:37,892 --> 00:14:41,020
To enable my students to thoroughly
analyze natural phenomenon.

232
00:14:41,187 --> 00:14:45,566
Oh, the rationale of your teaching
acquired from your PhD days at Trinston

233
00:14:45,691 --> 00:14:48,820
No, my undergraduate days
at St. Catherine the Divine.

234
00:14:48,945 --> 00:14:54,742
St. Catherine is really the most elegant
institution for young Catholic women.

235
00:14:56,035 --> 00:14:58,871
Particularly absorb what
St. Catherine had to offer.

236
00:14:59,080 --> 00:15:02,375
I was able to absorb the advice
of someone you hold so highly,

237
00:15:02,583 --> 00:15:03,918
And who might that be?

238
00:15:04,085 --> 00:15:07,588
The author of Isaiah.
Chapter one, verse 18.

239
00:15:09,131 --> 00:15:13,511
Come... let us reason
together, saith the Lord.

240
00:15:14,095 --> 00:15:19,851
Though your sins be as scarlet,
they shall be as white as snow.

241
00:15:20,017 --> 00:15:25,940
Here you find the connection of the
passage of Isaiah and your science.

242
00:15:26,107 --> 00:15:28,901
Yes, the guiding
word was reason.

243
00:15:29,026 --> 00:15:33,072
So was your interpretation of Isaiah's
reason to form blasphemous attacks

244
00:15:33,239 --> 00:15:36,242
upon our Lord and son
Jesus Christ, oh yes, Madam.

245
00:15:36,450 --> 00:15:40,705
Yes, you see Madam, unbeknownst to you,
I have been listening to your blasphemy.

246
00:15:40,913 --> 00:15:45,918
Huh? It appalls me and it appalls
the institution you are employed by.

247
00:15:46,085 --> 00:15:49,672
You are here to teach the value of
reason. The reason of Plato, Copernicus...

248
00:15:49,755 --> 00:15:53,801
The reason put forth of Isaiah
was a command directly from God.

249
00:15:53,926 --> 00:15:57,597
A command! To
think as he would think

250
00:15:57,722 --> 00:16:01,809
So we may humbly serve before
him and find his divine guidance.

251
00:16:01,893 --> 00:16:06,355
I am here to teach reason, logic,
all that is embodied in true science.

252
00:16:06,481 --> 00:16:08,232
What about God? What
about his commands?

253
00:16:08,316 --> 00:16:11,360
Your God is nothing but a fairy
tale. Fairy tale of non existing

254
00:16:11,444 --> 00:16:15,406
God is not non-existent. And that is the
message to be delivered at St. Genesius.

255
00:16:15,531 --> 00:16:16,782
And still is.

256
00:16:16,991 --> 00:16:20,203
Monsignor, I am a scientist, that has
been honored with international reputation

257
00:16:22,538 --> 00:16:26,584
astro-physics as my subject
matter is science, not hocus-bocus.

258
00:16:26,709 --> 00:16:29,462
Our divine Lord, hocus-bocus!

259
00:16:29,587 --> 00:16:33,716
You see, and I almost forgot. I'm having a
lecture here in Hankins on Thursday at 11 A.M.

260
00:16:33,883 --> 00:16:37,845
You are more that welcome to attend. I will
try my best to concentrate on the scientific.

261
00:16:38,137 --> 00:16:40,181
While skipping all
the hocus-pocus.

262
00:16:41,933 --> 00:16:43,768
Madam,

263
00:16:45,228 --> 00:16:46,771
[shouts] Madam!

264
00:16:49,774 --> 00:16:53,152
[strong music]

265
00:17:12,630 --> 00:17:14,257
[siren]

266
00:17:15,508 --> 00:17:18,136
Let us pray.

267
00:17:36,988 --> 00:17:41,659
[voice of Bastini] Do not cast
away from your presence, oh God.

268
00:18:00,678 --> 00:18:05,057
Do not cast away from
your presence, oh God, my...

269
00:18:06,726 --> 00:18:09,729
[echoing prayer]

270
00:18:10,980 --> 00:18:12,523
Nor take your Holy
Spirit from here...

271
00:18:15,651 --> 00:18:18,070
[echoes]

272
00:18:18,946 --> 00:18:22,909
And such as be seeded within
her by the forces of darkness

273
00:18:24,243 --> 00:18:26,287
darkness...

274
00:18:31,375 --> 00:18:34,629
[eerier music]

275
00:19:17,046 --> 00:19:18,089
[angry shout]

276
00:20:25,740 --> 00:20:27,742
Laura. You scared me.

277
00:20:28,493 --> 00:20:30,912
[Laura] What's the way to
get your attention these days.

278
00:20:31,537 --> 00:20:34,207
[Jeanine] I'm sorry. My
research is so frustrating.

279
00:20:35,124 --> 00:20:36,918
Is it worth it?

280
00:20:37,668 --> 00:20:39,754
Yes. Yes, it is worth it.

281
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:41,631
Hey, hey, hey!

282
00:20:41,656 --> 00:20:43,157
Sit

283
00:20:45,718 --> 00:20:47,345
What?

284
00:20:47,715 --> 00:20:49,606
Trying to prove there is no God?

285
00:20:50,571 --> 00:20:53,282
People are calling
you a devil worshiper.

286
00:20:53,627 --> 00:20:56,380
Some even say you
are the Antichrist.

287
00:20:56,706 --> 00:20:58,624
What do you think?

288
00:20:59,587 --> 00:21:01,673
I don't know what
to think anymore.

289
00:21:03,116 --> 00:21:06,536
I'm so lonely. I need my mother.

290
00:21:11,358 --> 00:21:13,110
I don't worship devils.

291
00:21:14,038 --> 00:21:16,374
I haven't gone crazy.

292
00:21:17,531 --> 00:21:22,453
And as far as Antichrist goes,
if my research goes as planned

293
00:21:23,339 --> 00:21:24,715
We'll see.

294
00:21:24,966 --> 00:21:26,008
[Laura] Mum

295
00:21:26,968 --> 00:21:32,098
This has to stop. I'm
at the breaking point.

296
00:21:32,431 --> 00:21:33,724
Hey, here.

297
00:21:38,195 --> 00:21:39,655
[door bell]

298
00:21:40,116 --> 00:21:41,909
Are you expecting someone?

299
00:21:42,538 --> 00:21:43,538
No.

300
00:21:44,616 --> 00:21:46,517
[dog whimpering]
- [Jeanine] Andy

301
00:21:47,446 --> 00:21:49,246
Will you take Andy for
me, please. [door bell]

302
00:21:49,907 --> 00:21:51,742
[door bell

303
00:21:52,122 --> 00:21:53,999
[Laura, would you put
him in my room, please.

304
00:21:54,620 --> 00:21:56,831
[door bell]

305
00:21:57,456 --> 00:22:00,501
-[Jeanine] Come in -Here.

306
00:22:01,127 --> 00:22:03,880
Something to wash
away the Bastini virus.

307
00:22:04,672 --> 00:22:06,632
[growls]̇ [Rinaldo] I
heard what happened.

308
00:22:06,841 --> 00:22:08,092
[Jeanine] Thanks.

309
00:22:08,593 --> 00:22:12,430
I'm sorry about Andy, I don't know why he
behaves so aggressively, only around you.

310
00:22:13,014 --> 00:22:14,348
That's true

311
00:22:14,995 --> 00:22:17,372
maybe you should off him.

312
00:22:18,394 --> 00:22:21,481
You know, to the vet. Give
him an injection or something.

313
00:22:21,564 --> 00:22:22,690
Rinaldo!

314
00:22:22,715 --> 00:22:25,009
Anyway, Bastini?

315
00:22:25,034 --> 00:22:27,787
Ignorant hypocrite.
Right out of the inquisition.

316
00:22:30,273 --> 00:22:33,401
Monsignor is not that nice.

317
00:22:33,426 --> 00:22:36,429
He insulted me in front of my
students. Threatened my job.

318
00:22:38,494 --> 00:22:40,079
Then you acquested your goal.

319
00:22:40,958 --> 00:22:44,837
Bastini feels the rumbling
beneath his throne.

320
00:22:44,862 --> 00:22:45,863
Closer.

321
00:22:46,631 --> 00:22:50,802
I wonder. Seems if the final piece of
the puzzle just keeps slipping away.

322
00:22:51,390 --> 00:22:52,600
We'll have it.

323
00:22:53,471 --> 00:22:55,056
Maybe sooner than you expect.

324
00:22:57,558 --> 00:23:01,145
After all these
years, what if... I'll fail?

325
00:23:04,065 --> 00:23:05,650
What if Laura is right?

326
00:23:07,068 --> 00:23:09,320
Keeping door of hell
seems to be all too real.

327
00:23:09,987 --> 00:23:12,365
Noel was a remarkable
man, Jeanine.

328
00:23:13,658 --> 00:23:16,369
But about his god, he
was... he was wrong.

329
00:23:17,328 --> 00:23:19,872
Very wrong. You won't fail.

330
00:23:20,540 --> 00:23:24,752
To pree astro physique you always
wanted. Someday, it will be yours.

331
00:23:24,877 --> 00:23:28,339
I pray. Seems like it
drifts further and further.

332
00:23:28,506 --> 00:23:31,217
All those that have come to
believe there is no god are here.

333
00:23:31,759 --> 00:23:33,636
Supporting you on your journey.

334
00:23:34,387 --> 00:23:35,388
My journey?

335
00:23:36,055 --> 00:23:39,308
Stay with it, Jeanine.
You'll get there.

336
00:23:39,934 --> 00:23:42,603
Able to predict the
future, Mr. Nostradamus?

337
00:23:43,855 --> 00:23:45,731
Trust me.

338
00:23:46,399 --> 00:23:48,401
Nostradamus had it right.

339
00:23:50,278 --> 00:23:53,406
Ever since Noel died, I
haven't been much of a mother.

340
00:23:54,657 --> 00:23:58,661
And not a good teacher
and not a very good friend.

341
00:24:01,706 --> 00:24:02,957
I know.

342
00:24:04,584 --> 00:24:07,003
I should really get some rest.

343
00:24:11,090 --> 00:24:12,592
Whenever you need me, just...

344
00:24:12,675 --> 00:24:14,677
Yeah, and thank you
again for the wine.

345
00:24:17,013 --> 00:24:21,225
About your lecture
tomorrow. Be very careful.

346
00:24:22,143 --> 00:24:26,689
Bastini just might try to give you a not
so gentle shove through the gates of hell.

347
00:24:28,900 --> 00:24:30,776
Where did you hear that?

348
00:24:31,319 --> 00:24:33,613
Enjoy the wine.

349
00:24:34,363 --> 00:24:35,907
Santo Lucifero.

350
00:24:37,033 --> 00:24:38,201
Very nice bottle

351
00:24:42,163 --> 00:24:43,915
But the journey is worth it.

352
00:24:44,582 --> 00:24:49,545
Thank you for being...
so encouraging.

353
00:25:08,189 --> 00:25:11,025
[voice of Noel] You have nothing
to show for your misguided research.

354
00:25:11,818 --> 00:25:15,071
[siren] There is no
such thing as systems...

355
00:25:15,154 --> 00:25:17,949
Out of nothing...
Nothing... Nothing...

356
00:25:18,157 --> 00:25:19,700
Ax at the heel of your feet

357
00:25:19,867 --> 00:25:21,786
Always was, always will be...

358
00:25:21,953 --> 00:25:25,498
Always was, always was...

359
00:25:35,758 --> 00:25:38,219
[gong]

360
00:25:40,346 --> 00:25:42,223
[gong]

361
00:25:43,641 --> 00:25:44,725
[growling]

362
00:25:45,059 --> 00:25:46,269
[gong]

363
00:26:07,707 --> 00:26:10,626
[panting]

364
00:26:14,881 --> 00:26:17,508
[dog panting]

365
00:26:21,429 --> 00:26:25,141
Professor Markham, I heard of
your recent encounter with Bastini.

366
00:26:25,725 --> 00:26:30,354
Your research is leading you to the conclusion
that creation has nothing to do with god.

367
00:26:30,855 --> 00:26:33,816
Now what is needed
by you is the final proof.

368
00:26:33,941 --> 00:26:37,737
Irrefutable proof, that will once
and for all end the god-myth.

369
00:26:37,862 --> 00:26:41,699
After a great deal of thought, I
have decided to reveal to you

370
00:26:41,866 --> 00:26:44,035
what you have sought for so long

371
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:48,748
Enclosed find the directions to my home
for next Saturday seven in the evening.

372
00:26:48,956 --> 00:26:51,834
I don't keep a phone,
so if you arrive, fine.

373
00:26:52,168 --> 00:26:53,920
If not, so be it.

374
00:26:54,253 --> 00:26:57,548
Very truly yours,
Jessica Dormender

375
00:26:57,924 --> 00:27:00,635
Mum, why are you up so late?

376
00:27:02,428 --> 00:27:04,472
There was a letter at the door.

377
00:27:05,389 --> 00:27:10,102
Supposedly from Jessica Dormender,
but I rather assume someone is playing.

378
00:27:11,729 --> 00:27:13,022
Jessica Dormender?

379
00:27:13,481 --> 00:27:18,861
Ah, come here. She
was one of the greatest...

380
00:27:19,153 --> 00:27:23,199
Awarded the Pree in '51 and '52.

381
00:27:24,116 --> 00:27:29,080
Break through in relating Space
time pulses with time travel.

382
00:27:29,914 --> 00:27:31,874
Sort of like backing
up the camera.

383
00:27:32,959 --> 00:27:36,921
Then she just disappeared,
dropped off the face of the earth.

384
00:27:38,047 --> 00:27:39,632
The FBI couldn't find her?

385
00:27:39,882 --> 00:27:43,761
Hmm, although they searched,
but Dormender was never found.

386
00:27:45,763 --> 00:27:47,306
Until now, maybe.

387
00:27:47,932 --> 00:27:51,227
She's got to be
eighty, ninety even.

388
00:27:51,686 --> 00:27:55,648
That's if she is alive,
if this letter is legit.

389
00:27:57,608 --> 00:28:01,696
What, whoever
she is, has to say?

390
00:28:03,865 --> 00:28:05,575
That she's got the answer.

391
00:28:05,783 --> 00:28:06,826
To what?

392
00:28:07,994 --> 00:28:10,371
Creation, the
beginning of everything.

393
00:28:10,580 --> 00:28:12,206
What you have
been after forever?

394
00:28:12,331 --> 00:28:14,709
Hmm, even longer than that.

395
00:28:15,376 --> 00:28:17,420
And that she wants me to visit.

396
00:28:17,962 --> 00:28:19,172
Visit her where, though?

397
00:28:20,423 --> 00:28:23,843
In Doxton, three or
four hours from here.

398
00:28:24,573 --> 00:28:29,327
Sounds fishy, Doormentor
or whatever she's called.

399
00:28:29,765 --> 00:28:32,852
Disappears for all these
years and no one can find her.

400
00:28:33,519 --> 00:28:35,062
But now she tells
you where she is.

401
00:28:35,229 --> 00:28:38,399
Hmm. Weird, huh.

402
00:28:40,401 --> 00:28:42,278
Probably just a sick joke.

403
00:28:44,530 --> 00:28:46,574
You could be with one of
your friends, couldn't you?

404
00:28:47,158 --> 00:28:50,661
My friends wouldn't
know Jessica Dormpoop...

405
00:28:50,786 --> 00:28:53,831
- Dormender.
- If she dropped on their laps.

406
00:28:55,875 --> 00:28:57,335
[Laura] Hmm.

407
00:28:57,543 --> 00:28:59,879
But what if it were
Jessica Dormender?

408
00:29:01,214 --> 00:29:03,591
I better call Rinaldo
and have him along.

409
00:29:04,509 --> 00:29:05,843
Could use his support.

410
00:29:10,473 --> 00:29:11,724
Couldn't be...

411
00:29:12,767 --> 00:29:13,851
Could it?

412
00:29:17,313 --> 00:29:18,731
What if it was?

413
00:29:22,360 --> 00:29:24,278
We need to get to bed.

414
00:29:25,905 --> 00:29:27,365
[a bang]

415
00:29:49,679 --> 00:29:53,975
[chanting music]

416
00:30:05,361 --> 00:30:08,656
[sounds from the accident]

417
00:30:11,367 --> 00:30:14,787
[chanting music]

418
00:30:18,833 --> 00:30:21,127
son

419
00:30:56,370 --> 00:30:59,832
[chanting music continues]

420
00:31:17,058 --> 00:31:18,100
[screeching]

421
00:31:29,487 --> 00:31:30,947
[loud crash]

422
00:31:32,865 --> 00:31:36,285
[chanting music]

423
00:32:10,319 --> 00:32:12,363
[sniffles]

424
00:32:34,844 --> 00:32:38,723
[eerier, suspenseful music]

425
00:33:01,370 --> 00:33:03,581
Ah, Did you see that?

426
00:33:04,081 --> 00:33:05,082
[Rinaldo] What?

427
00:33:06,834 --> 00:33:07,876
Andy

428
00:33:09,462 --> 00:33:10,713
Andy?

429
00:33:12,029 --> 00:33:14,448
We are good 150
miles from the dog.

430
00:33:15,343 --> 00:33:17,094
[sighs]

431
00:33:17,845 --> 00:33:19,347
Calm down.

432
00:33:28,773 --> 00:33:31,567
[eerier sounds]

433
00:33:38,157 --> 00:33:41,077
[unintelligible speech]

434
00:33:49,377 --> 00:33:52,839
[eerier sounds]

435
00:33:56,801 --> 00:33:58,386
[bangs on the steering wheel]

436
00:33:59,262 --> 00:34:02,014
[sobbing]

437
00:34:05,432 --> 00:34:06,600
What's going on?

438
00:34:08,604 --> 00:34:10,064
I saw him.

439
00:34:11,315 --> 00:34:13,151
[Rinaldo] Saw who?

440
00:34:14,399 --> 00:34:15,441
Noel

441
00:34:16,154 --> 00:34:18,531
He was trying to
tell me something.

442
00:34:18,614 --> 00:34:19,657
What?

443
00:34:20,950 --> 00:34:24,162
I don't know. I just
saw him for a moment.

444
00:34:28,332 --> 00:34:30,209
Noel is gone.

445
00:34:32,420 --> 00:34:34,172
You must accept that, Jeanine.

446
00:34:37,383 --> 00:34:39,469
Maybe I should drive.

447
00:34:54,759 --> 00:34:56,344
[Rinaldo] Right
at the next round.

448
00:35:07,413 --> 00:35:08,539
There it is.

449
00:35:17,924 --> 00:35:19,300
[bell rings]

450
00:35:20,802 --> 00:35:23,846
[breaths heavily] Yeah

451
00:35:35,441 --> 00:35:36,734
[Rinaldo] Here it is.

452
00:35:48,246 --> 00:35:49,789
[dog growling]

453
00:35:50,164 --> 00:35:51,207
Andy?

454
00:35:52,083 --> 00:35:55,503
Andy is it you? Andy,
come here, Andy.

455
00:35:56,587 --> 00:35:57,839
Come on.

456
00:35:59,298 --> 00:36:01,717
How did Andy get
in this bloody house.

457
00:36:17,275 --> 00:36:18,943
[knocking]

458
00:36:44,969 --> 00:36:46,262
[knocking hard]

459
00:36:46,387 --> 00:36:47,638
[from the inside] Patience.

460
00:36:51,559 --> 00:36:54,896
[from the inside] here
I come. I'm coming.

461
00:36:59,358 --> 00:37:01,777
Professor Markham! Come in!

462
00:37:01,944 --> 00:37:03,654
Doctor Dormender.

463
00:37:04,489 --> 00:37:07,074
Welcome! I've
been expecting you.

464
00:37:07,283 --> 00:37:09,869
You are alive. I wasn't sure.

465
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:13,915
Well of course,
I'm alive, I think.

466
00:37:17,835 --> 00:37:20,796
Uh-huh! Still pretty frisky, eh?

467
00:37:21,172 --> 00:37:23,049
Amazing, I can't even do two.

468
00:37:23,174 --> 00:37:24,759
Jeanine.

469
00:37:24,926 --> 00:37:27,136
Put your coats on the hooks.

470
00:37:31,098 --> 00:37:32,308
Thank you.

471
00:37:32,391 --> 00:37:33,518
[Jessica] Come in.

472
00:37:33,935 --> 00:37:38,606
And please, no more
Doctor Dormender it's Jessica.

473
00:37:39,565 --> 00:37:43,861
Now, How about some nice
hot tea, it will warm you up.

474
00:37:44,278 --> 00:37:46,447
And you can have
a bit of my cake.

475
00:37:47,073 --> 00:37:49,218
[Jeanine] Jessica, you really
shouldn't have troubled yourself.

476
00:37:49,242 --> 00:37:50,993
[Jessica] No trouble, sit down.

477
00:37:51,160 --> 00:37:52,245
Thank you.

478
00:37:52,370 --> 00:37:55,122
I would like to introduce you
to professor Rinaldo Algado

479
00:37:55,331 --> 00:37:57,625
He's a fellow faculty
member at St. Genesius

480
00:37:57,792 --> 00:38:00,169
It's an honor, Doctor Dormender.

481
00:38:05,216 --> 00:38:07,969
And may I ask you, what
is your field of academia?

482
00:38:08,094 --> 00:38:10,555
Dabble a bit in
Medieval History.

483
00:38:10,763 --> 00:38:13,808
Rinaldo is far too modest. He is
actually acknowledged of being

484
00:38:13,975 --> 00:38:16,495
one of the world's leading
authority on the Spanish inquisition.

485
00:38:16,519 --> 00:38:19,272
His writings are a major
reference on the subject matter.

486
00:38:19,397 --> 00:38:21,399
Particularly 16th
century instruments of...

487
00:38:21,524 --> 00:38:22,525
Persuasion.

488
00:38:23,901 --> 00:38:26,154
Yes, the ax.

489
00:38:27,446 --> 00:38:29,365
My husband's collection.

490
00:38:31,159 --> 00:38:37,707
From one of the more blood
thirsty North West Alaskan tribes.

491
00:38:38,791 --> 00:38:43,087
It is said that their throwing
technique was so developed,

492
00:38:43,212 --> 00:38:50,219
that they split open the skull
of a polar bear at fifty meters.

493
00:38:51,345 --> 00:38:53,848
Fifty meters!

494
00:38:55,141 --> 00:38:56,434
[clears throat]

495
00:38:59,729 --> 00:39:01,564
You have a charming
home, Jessica.

496
00:39:03,649 --> 00:39:07,528
Yes, my husband I have
enjoyed it for many years.

497
00:39:07,653 --> 00:39:09,614
Oh, Mr. Dormender
will he be joining us?

498
00:39:09,739 --> 00:39:14,702
[laughing] No, you are confused,
there is no Mr. Dormender

499
00:39:15,119 --> 00:39:18,247
Dormender was my maiden
name. I kept it after I was married.

500
00:39:18,331 --> 00:39:21,459
My husband... Oh... You
must have heard of him

501
00:39:22,084 --> 00:39:24,545
Doctor Professor
Sebastian Stillwell.

502
00:39:24,712 --> 00:39:27,048
Sebastian Stillwell
is your husband?

503
00:39:27,173 --> 00:39:30,384
Celestial Mathematics,
Astro-Physics, he's an icon.

504
00:39:30,468 --> 00:39:32,678
Stood out from the
crowd, Sebastian did.

505
00:39:32,804 --> 00:39:36,557
Including Albert
Einstein. [chuckles]

506
00:39:38,559 --> 00:39:42,355
Nineteen forty nine. A big year.

507
00:39:42,647 --> 00:39:45,900
Sebastian was far
ahead of his time.

508
00:39:47,068 --> 00:39:51,656
Einstein was odd. [chuckles]
Begged for an appointment.

509
00:39:52,281 --> 00:39:58,204
Visited us, had lunch with us,
downed several glasses of snaps,

510
00:39:58,329 --> 00:40:01,332
Einstein snaps?

511
00:40:01,582 --> 00:40:03,751
Albert loved his snaps.

512
00:40:05,545 --> 00:40:09,006
What he was really after,
however, was Sebastian's opinion

513
00:40:09,215 --> 00:40:14,053
on possibility of mathematical
imbalance to the time theorem

514
00:40:14,387 --> 00:40:15,805
[laughs]

515
00:40:16,013 --> 00:40:21,435
Albert was so pathetically confused
about essential mathematics.

516
00:40:22,103 --> 00:40:26,190
Sebastian felt sorry for him,
tried to put him on the right track.

517
00:40:26,649 --> 00:40:30,862
But Albert, always so
stubborn, stuck to his theory.

518
00:40:31,404 --> 00:40:34,490
That must have been what lead to
his mistakes in the Theory of Relativity.

519
00:40:35,158 --> 00:40:36,242
Good for you.

520
00:40:41,330 --> 00:40:45,293
Anyway, Albert
bid to join our team.

521
00:40:46,460 --> 00:40:52,133
We declined. Sebastian felt our
research had left Albert far behind.

522
00:40:52,550 --> 00:40:55,094
[chuckles] Albert
was almost in tears.

523
00:40:56,345 --> 00:40:58,639
Uh, Jessica, you really,
you shouldn't have...

524
00:40:58,806 --> 00:41:01,726
- Gone to this much trouble.
- No trouble.

525
00:41:02,810 --> 00:41:04,854
Now, if you're finished...

526
00:41:05,897 --> 00:41:07,815
Let us get to why you came here.

527
00:41:08,316 --> 00:41:09,650
Follow me.

528
00:41:28,461 --> 00:41:29,712
[Jessica] Here we are.

529
00:41:42,850 --> 00:41:44,477
No need to panic.

530
00:42:01,953 --> 00:42:03,913
- [clinking sound]
- [door creaks]

531
00:42:21,556 --> 00:42:22,640
[sighs]

532
00:42:31,232 --> 00:42:32,733
Just look.

533
00:42:34,569 --> 00:42:38,489
[Jessica] You have to look or you might
miss something that is really important.

534
00:42:49,333 --> 00:42:51,419
[Jessica] There, matches.

535
00:43:30,082 --> 00:43:31,584
[knock]

536
00:43:43,971 --> 00:43:46,211
[Jessica] You can sit in
the leather chair if you like...

537
00:43:46,349 --> 00:43:51,437
Sebastian used to sit there, when he was
into some of his most original concepts.

538
00:43:59,320 --> 00:44:01,197
[loud scream]

539
00:44:52,290 --> 00:44:56,419
Like Einstein I was reversing the
predominate gravitational effects.

540
00:44:56,752 --> 00:44:58,796
It seemed like
the only possibility.

541
00:45:00,631 --> 00:45:02,884
Einstein was wrong, I was wrong.

542
00:45:06,512 --> 00:45:09,474
Uh, yes, in front of me, what
I've been after all these years.

543
00:45:10,057 --> 00:45:14,020
And what you're saying is what
the church has been fearing forever...

544
00:45:14,228 --> 00:45:16,439
Jessica you must
make this known.

545
00:45:16,606 --> 00:45:19,525
[Jessica] I could, for
sure I could... But I won't.

546
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:24,447
Being raised first baptized meant
standing at the fore front of faith...

547
00:45:25,156 --> 00:45:29,827
And then to realize that our
search had led to conclusions...

548
00:45:30,536 --> 00:45:34,457
That proved,
irrefutably proved...

549
00:45:34,916 --> 00:45:36,667
There was no God.

550
00:45:37,126 --> 00:45:38,419
Well.

551
00:45:38,836 --> 00:45:42,798
- Jessica, what you have here will finally end the myth.
- [Jessica] Yes.

552
00:45:43,341 --> 00:45:46,511
- That's why I'm making this research available to you.
- [loud bang]

553
00:45:48,805 --> 00:45:50,245
- What was that?
- [Jessica chuckles]

554
00:45:51,432 --> 00:45:52,934
Furnace trouble. [chuckles]

555
00:45:53,643 --> 00:45:55,561
[Jessica] Seems to
be getting too hot lately.

556
00:45:57,021 --> 00:45:58,898
Nothing to worry about.

557
00:45:59,482 --> 00:46:01,567
The furnace guy
will be coming soon.

558
00:46:02,109 --> 00:46:03,945
A gentle tap on the floor.

559
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,783
Must move one of the pipes,
stops that damn rumbling.

560
00:46:13,120 --> 00:46:16,290
- There's significance in it all.
- I could, but I'm not going to.

561
00:46:16,666 --> 00:46:18,584
- But Jessica...
- No, never!

562
00:46:18,709 --> 00:46:22,213
I invited you here, because it is
you who must make this known...

563
00:46:22,588 --> 00:46:26,509
With your preeminent position
in the world of astro physics...

564
00:46:26,676 --> 00:46:29,512
You'll be credited with
the appropriate perception.

565
00:46:30,763 --> 00:46:35,810
Besides, Sebastian and I could
never deal with the publicity if...

566
00:46:36,060 --> 00:46:39,730
We were the ones put forth
that finally put the dagger in God.

567
00:46:40,106 --> 00:46:42,608
- Jessica, you deserve...
- No.

568
00:46:43,609 --> 00:46:48,072
[chuckles] This is for you and
for you alone to take the credit.

569
00:46:49,615 --> 00:46:53,661
But... The inclement might
come with it, maybe even the pree.

570
00:46:53,911 --> 00:46:56,192
- [Jessica] Likely.
- [Rinaldo] Didn't I tell you Jeanine?

571
00:46:56,455 --> 00:46:57,957
[Rinaldo] Didn't I predict it?

572
00:46:59,417 --> 00:47:02,253
The notoriety that
comes from fame.

573
00:47:03,004 --> 00:47:04,964
Sebastian wouldn't
much care for that.

574
00:47:05,381 --> 00:47:06,883
- But Jessica...
- No.

575
00:47:07,800 --> 00:47:09,594
Final no.

576
00:47:11,888 --> 00:47:15,892
Now, do I have your
agreement or not?

577
00:47:17,268 --> 00:47:19,562
And if not, the
search remains here.

578
00:47:20,313 --> 00:47:23,483
The papers which you took
notes are only part of the answer.

579
00:47:24,734 --> 00:47:30,239
There is more... That
will clearly irrefutably...

580
00:47:31,365 --> 00:47:34,118
Validate the no God concept.

581
00:47:34,577 --> 00:47:35,786
And...

582
00:47:38,372 --> 00:47:41,250
It is in my hands.

583
00:47:42,502 --> 00:47:44,587
My ace in the hole.

584
00:47:46,088 --> 00:47:47,381
So?

585
00:47:47,965 --> 00:47:49,801
Do we have an agreement?

586
00:48:01,479 --> 00:48:02,814
Good.

587
00:48:04,732 --> 00:48:07,860
[Jessica] Now, you
better be getting home.

588
00:48:09,320 --> 00:48:12,990
It's a little bit of a ride
back to Saint Genesius.

589
00:48:13,574 --> 00:48:17,078
[Jeanine] Jessica I really don't
know what to say, except for thank you.

590
00:48:17,245 --> 00:48:19,539
No need for thanks, no need.

591
00:48:19,705 --> 00:48:23,501
My thanks will be the
results of all I've given you.

592
00:48:24,877 --> 00:48:26,420
Thank you again.

593
00:48:31,134 --> 00:48:33,511
Look after than furnace
problem, Jessica.

594
00:48:34,137 --> 00:48:36,013
Seems a bit impatient.

595
00:48:36,139 --> 00:48:40,476
Furnace repairman will figure it
out, he's pretty good at his job.

596
00:48:49,694 --> 00:48:51,654
Atheistic, I'd
love to hear them.

597
00:48:51,863 --> 00:48:53,447
I haven't heard one yet.

598
00:48:55,324 --> 00:48:58,619
How does something come from
nothing, with extreme fine tuning.

599
00:48:59,871 --> 00:49:01,539
What is the
explanation for that?

600
00:49:01,747 --> 00:49:04,208
[man 2] All we know
is how little we know.

601
00:49:04,834 --> 00:49:07,879
That's been for many years my
definition of an educated person.

602
00:49:08,254 --> 00:49:10,506
Someone who knows enough
to know who ignorant they are.

603
00:49:10,590 --> 00:49:13,150
- [man] Uh, Arthur Edington...
- [man 2] It is a wonderful thing.

604
00:49:15,720 --> 00:49:21,184
[inaudible]

605
00:49:21,350 --> 00:49:24,103
[man] unless we agree
to multi... [voice fades]

606
00:49:25,855 --> 00:49:27,857
[news jingle]

607
00:49:32,445 --> 00:49:35,031
based on his static universe
model, missed the target...

608
00:49:35,156 --> 00:49:39,660
In actuality it was self existing gravitational
factors which were the very beginning.

609
00:49:40,036 --> 00:49:42,747
The first heart beat
if you will, of creation.

610
00:49:43,039 --> 00:49:46,834
Issues that were once unresolved
are now conclusively resolved.

611
00:49:47,376 --> 00:49:49,629
So where is your research
heading, professor?

612
00:49:50,046 --> 00:49:51,297
[reporter] If you're right?

613
00:49:51,506 --> 00:49:53,049
[Jeanine] Be
assured they are right.

614
00:49:53,132 --> 00:49:56,052
Now that the God thing was dealt
with, the possibilities are endless.

615
00:49:56,177 --> 00:49:58,221
For me there are
scientists everywhere...

616
00:49:58,387 --> 00:49:59,722
[Monsignor] How entertaining.

617
00:50:03,476 --> 00:50:07,188
Your so called evidence it's
just not even understandable.

618
00:50:07,271 --> 00:50:10,566
But you have to admit, Monsignor,
that what professor Markham presented...

619
00:50:10,983 --> 00:50:13,402
- It's overwhelming outlets.
- [Monsignor] I'll admit...

620
00:50:14,904 --> 00:50:18,115
It's more like an overwhelming
exercise in scientific gibberish.

621
00:50:18,324 --> 00:50:20,952
Self-existing gravitational...

622
00:50:21,244 --> 00:50:23,329
[Monsignor] Something
rather in [inaudible]

623
00:50:23,663 --> 00:50:25,665
Einstein's comilog...

624
00:50:26,290 --> 00:50:28,167
Cosmiracle...

625
00:50:31,337 --> 00:50:32,880
Constant...

626
00:50:33,005 --> 00:50:34,966
It's just gibberish
no matter what.

627
00:50:35,341 --> 00:50:37,385
You question, Monsignor?

628
00:50:40,638 --> 00:50:44,016
Professor... Doctor...

629
00:50:45,017 --> 00:50:46,727
Or as you prefer, madam...

630
00:50:49,355 --> 00:50:50,690
Do you have any...

631
00:50:50,773 --> 00:50:52,817
I emphasize, any...

632
00:50:54,026 --> 00:50:56,696
Irrefutable proof...

633
00:50:57,113 --> 00:51:00,449
Of this dubious proposition
of yours, of self-existence...

634
00:51:05,538 --> 00:51:11,252
I mean I could make you 100
more likely and call it science.

635
00:51:11,419 --> 00:51:12,920
Even witch craft.

636
00:51:13,087 --> 00:51:15,548
Taking on, to the
Monsignors question...

637
00:51:15,631 --> 00:51:19,510
Professor, have your calculations,
would they be of science or...

638
00:51:19,927 --> 00:51:22,513
As the Monsignor
characterizes it, witch craft.

639
00:51:30,521 --> 00:51:33,900
Attaches to the Monsignors
indications to a non-existing God.

640
00:51:37,153 --> 00:51:41,240
There has not been a single such
institution that has disproved my findings.

641
00:51:41,365 --> 00:51:43,326
[Monsignor] you
research is rubbish!

642
00:51:43,618 --> 00:51:46,412
It's complete rubbish,
it's convoluted!

643
00:51:51,792 --> 00:51:53,419
Shall we say, understandable?

644
00:51:55,713 --> 00:51:57,798
And you for allowing
such nonsense.

645
00:51:57,882 --> 00:52:03,054
To be spoken as truth,
and shame on you madam.

646
00:52:03,596 --> 00:52:05,515
[Monsignor] For not
knowing your place.

647
00:52:06,390 --> 00:52:07,975
I...

648
00:52:08,893 --> 00:52:11,938
Pray to the good Lord.

649
00:52:13,481 --> 00:52:16,108
To spare you his wraith.

650
00:52:16,567 --> 00:52:19,487
I'm... Finding...

651
00:52:22,114 --> 00:52:29,288
Difficult... Now to
repeat... That purely...

652
00:52:33,835 --> 00:52:35,211
Got to go.

653
00:52:36,045 --> 00:52:38,631
[reporter] Uh, thank
you Monsignor Bastini.

654
00:52:39,340 --> 00:52:44,804
- Professor Markham, thank you for this enlightening interview.
- Of course.

655
00:52:44,887 --> 00:52:46,681
And thank you, our viewers...

656
00:52:47,056 --> 00:52:48,432
For tuning in.

657
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:51,185
[loud bell ringing]

658
00:52:52,478 --> 00:52:55,064
[lady] We were at the
streets, very early this morning,

659
00:52:55,148 --> 00:52:58,985
when all this started,
around 6:50am...

660
00:52:59,235 --> 00:53:03,698
So now all around me there
is just trash all in the city.

661
00:53:06,033 --> 00:53:09,328
[lady reporter] Streets were
trashed, and police responded to it.

662
00:53:10,204 --> 00:53:12,290
[indistinctive radio report]

663
00:53:26,095 --> 00:53:27,722
[indistinctive chatter]

664
00:53:27,805 --> 00:53:29,140
[man] You!

665
00:53:29,515 --> 00:53:32,852
You couldn't leave it alone, could
you? You had to take God from us...

666
00:53:34,353 --> 00:53:37,190
[grocer] Hey! What are you
doing you crazy son of a bitch!

667
00:53:44,113 --> 00:53:46,240
[indistinctive radio report]

668
00:53:50,745 --> 00:53:53,748
religion no longer
offers anything important.

669
00:53:54,123 --> 00:53:56,667
I think that is exactly wrong.

670
00:53:57,001 --> 00:53:58,794
[man 2] Does God exist?

671
00:53:59,545 --> 00:54:02,465
[man 3] With me, yes it does.

672
00:54:03,549 --> 00:54:04,884
It must do.

673
00:54:05,176 --> 00:54:08,721
He must do
because... [voices fade]

674
00:54:08,888 --> 00:54:10,765
[Laura] Mom, are you with me!

675
00:54:10,973 --> 00:54:12,892
Yes of course I'm with you.

676
00:54:15,436 --> 00:54:17,855
I don't believe you.

677
00:54:18,272 --> 00:54:21,984
-Well I'm sorry Laura, but the
truth matters... -And what about me?

678
00:54:22,985 --> 00:54:24,612
Don't I matter?

679
00:54:25,780 --> 00:54:29,033
Like dad, I wanted
to have God in my life.

680
00:54:29,784 --> 00:54:31,911
Doesn't it mean anything to you?

681
00:54:34,997 --> 00:54:38,209
It's nothing but an attempt to
ward off the realities of death.

682
00:54:38,960 --> 00:54:42,004
[Laura] Somethings,
even if true...

683
00:54:42,421 --> 00:54:44,382
Don't need to be exposed.

684
00:54:44,882 --> 00:54:49,595
But you are too selfish and wrapped
up in your science understand...

685
00:54:49,929 --> 00:54:52,348
I am sorry that
you feel that way...

686
00:54:52,723 --> 00:54:56,352
But you must know,
that you, not Science...

687
00:54:56,435 --> 00:54:58,396
Are the center of my life.

688
00:54:59,822 --> 00:55:01,407
Then show it.

689
00:55:01,662 --> 00:55:03,747
[Jeanine] Hey, hey!
Do not walk out...

690
00:55:23,838 --> 00:55:25,715
[phone ringing]

691
00:55:29,886 --> 00:55:31,846
[phone continues ringing]

692
00:55:32,805 --> 00:55:35,183
[indistinctive radio report]

693
00:55:50,323 --> 00:55:55,328
[college leader] The Istle Physic Committee
is pleased to present this year's recipient...

694
00:55:55,661 --> 00:55:58,247
I am proud to present,
Dr. Jeanine Markham,

695
00:55:58,331 --> 00:56:03,711
with this distinction for conclusive
research entitled 'A Final Cosmic Answer.'

696
00:56:04,462 --> 00:56:06,130
[crowd applause]

697
00:56:25,900 --> 00:56:27,527
[applause continues]

698
00:56:47,129 --> 00:56:49,048
I would like to thank
the committee...

699
00:56:51,300 --> 00:56:54,095
For bestowing all my research
to this great, great honor.

700
00:56:58,933 --> 00:57:02,895
But I must confess, that in carrying
out my research to it's conclusions...

701
00:57:08,651 --> 00:57:11,070
It's always been a
serious concern of mine...

702
00:57:15,366 --> 00:57:20,580
To prove that God is not in fact the creator
to all those who believed in a God...

703
00:57:25,960 --> 00:57:28,504
To take away
something so special...

704
00:57:30,886 --> 00:57:32,429
Though it be fiction...

705
00:57:35,011 --> 00:57:36,679
Was not an easy task.

706
00:57:38,294 --> 00:57:41,756
But my final
determination was and is...

707
00:57:42,685 --> 00:57:44,270
That truth...

708
00:57:44,820 --> 00:57:46,154
Is all.

709
00:57:49,635 --> 00:57:51,970
And that has led
me to this great...

710
00:57:52,576 --> 00:57:55,996
Award in which you give me
tonight and for that I thank you.

711
00:57:56,407 --> 00:57:58,034
[crowd applause]

712
00:58:19,090 --> 00:58:20,509
[Rinaldo] What a month!

713
00:58:20,534 --> 00:58:24,288
The piaster physic,
all of it, it's fabulous!

714
00:58:26,646 --> 00:58:29,440
Fabulous that my daughter
won't even talk to me anymore.

715
00:58:30,600 --> 00:58:32,436
Your daughter?

716
00:58:33,351 --> 00:58:34,852
Jeanine...

717
00:58:35,078 --> 00:58:36,747
Keep your mind on now.

718
00:58:38,282 --> 00:58:40,660
You've turned the entire
world upside down...

719
00:58:42,703 --> 00:58:45,790
Something's bothering me,
I just don't know what it is.

720
00:58:47,083 --> 00:58:49,502
[Rinaldo] Because of
you, no one gets rid of it...

721
00:58:50,511 --> 00:58:52,179
Thousands of years...

722
00:58:52,630 --> 00:58:56,008
Making us play his game,
forcing us to pay the privilege.

723
00:58:56,509 --> 00:58:57,885
He's foolish.

724
00:59:00,847 --> 00:59:02,557
I just don't want to cry.

725
00:59:04,892 --> 00:59:07,311
He's only the 17th director.

726
00:59:07,728 --> 00:59:10,606
Breathe. All will
be beyond soon.

727
00:59:18,496 --> 00:59:23,626
Also believed in God. I clinged on to him
as the last hope in this miserable world.

728
00:59:25,997 --> 00:59:27,206
[sighs]

729
00:59:27,415 --> 00:59:29,167
I never gave them much thought.

730
00:59:29,625 --> 00:59:31,502
[Rinaldo] Think about
yourself, Jeanine.

731
00:59:33,504 --> 00:59:35,089
Think about the pree.

732
00:59:38,426 --> 00:59:39,760
[clink]

733
00:59:49,520 --> 00:59:51,272
[inaudible]

734
00:59:51,647 --> 00:59:53,900
I've taken God from
them, they frighten me.

735
00:59:54,775 --> 00:59:56,444
Like they've lost a child.

736
00:59:57,403 --> 00:59:59,197
Yes, their only child.

737
01:00:00,156 --> 01:00:03,910
[Rinaldo] But your research has shown
that it was a child that never existed.

738
01:00:05,661 --> 01:00:08,623
For centuries', a false image.

739
01:00:09,165 --> 01:00:11,000
But no perhaps... Something...

740
01:00:11,542 --> 01:00:12,835
Real.

741
01:00:13,920 --> 01:00:15,338
What are you talking about?

742
01:00:15,796 --> 01:00:17,965
Oh nothing. [chuckles]

743
01:00:18,090 --> 01:00:19,926
Come on, let's dance.

744
01:00:45,368 --> 01:00:47,328
- [phone ringing]
- [phone dialing]

745
01:00:48,955 --> 01:00:51,266
[voice recording] Please leave
your message after the tone...

746
01:00:51,290 --> 01:00:53,751
- Press any key to end...
- [beep]

747
01:00:56,879 --> 01:00:58,589
And that's your fault,
I hope you're happy.

748
01:00:58,840 --> 01:01:00,466
I hope you're fucking happy!

749
01:01:00,550 --> 01:01:02,051
I'll burn your
fucking house down.

750
01:01:02,176 --> 01:01:05,680
- Give you a taste of how you'll spend eternity.
- [beep]

751
01:01:52,059 --> 01:01:53,561
[Jeanine] Andy!

752
01:01:53,769 --> 01:01:55,396
Andy!

753
01:01:55,897 --> 01:01:57,273
[Andy softly growling]

754
01:02:10,244 --> 01:02:11,370
[sighs]

755
01:03:37,039 --> 01:03:39,000
[Jessica] I'm coming.

756
01:03:47,592 --> 01:03:49,469
Patience

757
01:03:52,555 --> 01:03:57,018
Mommy will be down
in just a moment.

758
01:04:01,564 --> 01:04:03,444
[Jessica] That's the
trouble with youth today...

759
01:04:03,608 --> 01:04:05,776
No patience.

760
01:04:13,451 --> 01:04:18,122
I keep telling you, you got to
be careful, playing with matches.

761
01:04:23,753 --> 01:04:27,673
Don't want to burn
this dump down, do we?

762
01:04:33,095 --> 01:04:34,305
[sighs]

763
01:04:40,686 --> 01:04:42,063
[groans]

764
01:04:43,481 --> 01:04:44,899
[groans]

765
01:04:46,901 --> 01:04:49,821
[groaning]

766
01:07:50,168 --> 01:07:51,752
- [thud]
- What?

767
01:07:57,258 --> 01:07:59,969
Jessica Dormender,
Dormender house...

768
01:08:00,136 --> 01:08:02,013
What happened to it?

769
01:08:03,139 --> 01:08:04,807
[lady] What are
you talking about?

770
01:08:05,641 --> 01:08:07,852
You look so much like her...

771
01:08:08,603 --> 01:08:10,062
Younger.

772
01:08:13,024 --> 01:08:16,569
You're Jessica Dormender, I
visited you at your house and...

773
01:08:16,861 --> 01:08:18,488
Now it's no longer there...

774
01:08:18,571 --> 01:08:21,616
- You're so much younger...
- What's no longer there?

775
01:08:21,824 --> 01:08:24,327
- What are you talking, about lady?
- You're Jessica.

776
01:08:29,540 --> 01:08:32,376
[lady] What are you trying
to do with your Jessica crap?

777
01:08:33,294 --> 01:08:35,796
You better leave before
I call the cops, bitch.

778
01:08:36,714 --> 01:08:40,218
You, you were ancient now
you're so young, and you're,

779
01:08:40,676 --> 01:08:42,929
- you're voice!
- Ancient? [chuckles]

780
01:08:43,262 --> 01:08:45,223
I'm barely 20-years old.

781
01:08:46,557 --> 01:08:48,476
Have you hit your
head or something?

782
01:08:49,101 --> 01:08:50,394
Madame.

783
01:08:50,603 --> 01:08:52,355
You know besides,
it's really later.

784
01:08:55,691 --> 01:08:56,984
[lady] What?

785
01:08:57,819 --> 01:08:59,445
You're not going to leave?

786
01:09:00,530 --> 01:09:02,573
[chuckles] Sebastian.

787
01:09:02,782 --> 01:09:06,410
You better come here,
there's a crazy lady.

788
01:09:07,078 --> 01:09:10,748
Something about a
Jessica ancient she said...

789
01:09:19,173 --> 01:09:21,050
What is it madam?

790
01:09:21,467 --> 01:09:24,011
[Jeanine] You, you're Sebastian?

791
01:09:25,179 --> 01:09:28,975
You're... But you're a student
in my astro physics class...

792
01:09:29,308 --> 01:09:33,187
And Sebastian Stillwell he's got to
be 100-years old, he's got to be dead.

793
01:09:33,813 --> 01:09:38,234
[lady] Dead? [giggles] well you sure
didn't act dead a few minutes ago...

794
01:09:39,569 --> 01:09:43,865
The bitch has been calling me
Jessica, saying I used to be ancient.

795
01:09:44,615 --> 01:09:47,034
Now she thinks she knows you...

796
01:09:47,368 --> 01:09:50,288
You must be mistaken, madam.

797
01:09:50,872 --> 01:09:54,125
Is there anything
we can do for you?

798
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:56,002
[heavy breathing] No.

799
01:09:57,795 --> 01:09:59,589
- [heavy breath]
- [scream]

800
01:10:02,425 --> 01:10:04,677
[Samuel] Well shucks Jeanine.

801
01:10:07,096 --> 01:10:08,681
It's great seeing you.

802
01:10:09,348 --> 01:10:13,311
Twang? Samuel
Clemmings, it can't be you...

803
01:10:13,895 --> 01:10:17,148
Space time suspended
animation does the trick.

804
01:10:17,482 --> 01:10:19,358
Well as for being dead...

805
01:10:20,359 --> 01:10:22,653
I'm still pretty frisky
for being dead.

806
01:10:24,405 --> 01:10:30,453
Your reputation and courage has
struck an accordion in my heart.

807
01:10:30,536 --> 01:10:33,581
Albert, it struck a
chord in my heart.

808
01:10:34,957 --> 01:10:36,584
This can't be real.

809
01:10:37,335 --> 01:10:41,422
It's what we call
suspended animation...

810
01:10:41,839 --> 01:10:44,091
[chuckles]

811
01:10:44,592 --> 01:10:45,968
Where am I?

812
01:10:46,052 --> 01:10:47,178
[echoes]

813
01:10:47,345 --> 01:10:49,305
In a world that is blind.

814
01:10:49,430 --> 01:10:54,435
In my child I speak for all of us when
I say, that you have enriched science.

815
01:10:54,519 --> 01:10:57,772
- [Jeanine] Aristotle, it can't be you...
- Anything is possible, Jeanine.

816
01:10:58,189 --> 01:10:59,816
Anything and everything.

817
01:10:59,899 --> 01:11:03,945
Your writing is a natural motion. A
motion that requires an extreme cause...

818
01:11:04,195 --> 01:11:07,073
Self-existing concepts,
makes you live like them...

819
01:11:07,156 --> 01:11:10,785
Your research of self-existence,
far exceeds my infantile efforts.

820
01:11:11,160 --> 01:11:12,578
Come along, Jeanine.

821
01:11:12,912 --> 01:11:15,206
Let me introduce you to one
of your loveliest supporters.

822
01:11:15,331 --> 01:11:18,501
- Madame Du Barry.
- It's a great pleasure...

823
01:11:18,584 --> 01:11:22,046
To meet such a remarkable woman.

824
01:11:22,755 --> 01:11:24,841
And so charming. [chuckles]

825
01:11:25,383 --> 01:11:26,634
Indeed.

826
01:11:26,717 --> 01:11:29,345
Madame Du Barry haven't
we met somewhere before?

827
01:11:29,428 --> 01:11:33,141
No, oh no, it's impossible.

828
01:11:33,432 --> 01:11:39,730
I would never forget such a
remarkable and charming woman.

829
01:11:39,856 --> 01:11:42,817
Mr. Twang I'm sure I've met
Madame Du Barry somewhere before.

830
01:11:45,069 --> 01:11:47,905
[sighs] I'm so confused,
where did you say I am?

831
01:11:48,114 --> 01:11:50,283
You're in the world
of the irrefutable.

832
01:11:50,366 --> 01:11:52,451
- And you're all here...
- To support you!

833
01:11:52,535 --> 01:11:54,912
And to help you on your mission.

834
01:11:55,037 --> 01:11:56,330
But why?

835
01:11:56,414 --> 01:11:59,417
Did you not swear on the
path, faith is chosen for you...

836
01:11:59,792 --> 01:12:02,044
And everything is present
in such proper order.

837
01:12:02,128 --> 01:12:04,172
But the 666 on the research...

838
01:12:04,797 --> 01:12:06,132
Is this real?

839
01:12:06,215 --> 01:12:09,135
Surly it's all a matter of
one's perspective, isn't it?

840
01:12:09,218 --> 01:12:10,970
- I know what I saw...
- Jeanine.

841
01:12:11,637 --> 01:12:13,764
What does 999 look like?

842
01:12:13,890 --> 01:12:15,850
- Upside down.
- Yeah.

843
01:12:16,058 --> 01:12:18,144
When the bottom is the top,

844
01:12:18,269 --> 01:12:20,062
and the top is the bottom.

845
01:12:20,229 --> 01:12:22,857
The bottom is the top
and the top is the bottom...

846
01:12:23,900 --> 01:12:26,444
Well now I, I see it clearly.

847
01:12:26,569 --> 01:12:28,571
Yeah, that's how you see it.

848
01:12:29,071 --> 01:12:32,700
999 upside down, how
stupid of me for not seeing that.

849
01:12:34,702 --> 01:12:36,913
She was 90 then 20,
then 20 then 90 and...

850
01:12:37,079 --> 01:12:40,625
It's a nightmare, mental fatigue,
the pressure, overwhelming...

851
01:12:40,833 --> 01:12:42,460
Charles Darwin, Charlie...

852
01:12:42,585 --> 01:12:44,754
Professor Jeanine Markham.

853
01:12:45,379 --> 01:12:48,716
Mr. Darwin, I've been such a
fan of yours ever since high school.

854
01:12:48,799 --> 01:12:50,718
How flattering.

855
01:12:50,843 --> 01:12:56,974
But your research, far more
important than anything I've ever done.

856
01:12:57,934 --> 01:13:00,311
It's what we've
been waiting for.

857
01:13:00,645 --> 01:13:02,104
[chuckles]

858
01:13:03,981 --> 01:13:06,984
- Even longer.
- And now you've all made it so clear...

859
01:13:10,279 --> 01:13:12,323
[everyone] Nine, nine, nine.

860
01:13:12,406 --> 01:13:14,742
- Upside down.
- So the research, it was true.

861
01:13:14,909 --> 01:13:17,912
- Completely.
- And having nothing to do with the devil...

862
01:13:17,995 --> 01:13:19,413
[all laugh]

863
01:13:19,497 --> 01:13:22,291
I'm so grateful to you all,
for helping me get this right.

864
01:13:23,042 --> 01:13:24,710
And for reassuring me...

865
01:13:25,253 --> 01:13:27,964
[Jeanine and man] That
it was absolutely not his.

866
01:13:30,550 --> 01:13:32,677
But a great astrophysicist.

867
01:13:32,844 --> 01:13:35,847
Which is what you
are, your research...

868
01:13:36,097 --> 01:13:39,934
Irrefutable. [echoes]

869
01:13:42,728 --> 01:13:44,105
Father...

870
01:13:46,732 --> 01:13:48,025
Rinaldo.

871
01:13:49,026 --> 01:13:50,319
Jeanine.

872
01:13:50,778 --> 01:13:52,613
I see you've met my friends.

873
01:13:52,864 --> 01:13:54,574
They've been dying to meet you.

874
01:13:55,908 --> 01:13:57,368
[Jeanine screams]

875
01:13:57,493 --> 01:13:59,120
What have you done to my dog!

876
01:13:59,412 --> 01:14:01,497
What did you do!

877
01:14:01,789 --> 01:14:03,791
[screams] Andy!

878
01:14:04,125 --> 01:14:05,710
Somebody help!

879
01:14:06,002 --> 01:14:07,545
Andy!

880
01:14:08,045 --> 01:14:09,547
[screams]

881
01:14:22,393 --> 01:14:25,688
but he is very interested
in attending Geniuses.

882
01:14:26,189 --> 01:14:29,942
And his academic
qualifications imply outstanding...

883
01:14:31,402 --> 01:14:33,696
I thought you wouldn't
mind seeing him...

884
01:14:33,863 --> 01:14:37,116
[Markham] Oh, yes, yes, it's
fine, just please remind me.

885
01:14:37,909 --> 01:14:39,827
That I have that curriculum
committee meeting...

886
01:14:39,994 --> 01:14:42,121
- I don't want to miss it.
- Ok.

887
01:14:45,166 --> 01:14:49,128
I'll be with you in a moment, in the meantime
why don't you tell me a bit about yourself.

888
01:14:49,378 --> 01:14:51,964
Well I'm very interested
in attending, Geniuses.

889
01:14:54,759 --> 01:14:57,845
Wasn't the universities name
originally Saint Geniuses?

890
01:14:58,012 --> 01:15:04,310
Yes, but the administration decided to eliminate
saint, once the God favor was put to rest.

891
01:15:04,560 --> 01:15:06,646
Mom, mom, mom!

892
01:15:08,731 --> 01:15:11,859
[lady] Oh good, you're
coming out of your faint.

893
01:15:12,068 --> 01:15:13,611
Would you like a cookie?

894
01:15:13,820 --> 01:15:16,197
[man] You gave
us quite the scare.

895
01:15:16,989 --> 01:15:18,658
Would you like a cup of tea?

896
01:15:19,325 --> 01:15:22,161
Mom, wake up. You
were having a nightmare.

897
01:15:23,538 --> 01:15:25,748
- Mom.
- They were all there...

898
01:15:25,832 --> 01:15:27,458
Albert Einstein.

899
01:15:27,667 --> 01:15:29,627
Ernest Dunham.

900
01:15:32,839 --> 01:15:34,465
I could tell...

901
01:15:36,926 --> 01:15:38,678
[man] Sorry, behind you...

902
01:15:38,803 --> 01:15:41,430
Is that the priest physic...

903
01:15:41,514 --> 01:15:45,476
That you were awarded for your
research and eliminating the God family?

904
01:15:45,726 --> 01:15:48,104
[Jeanine] Yes, the
pre-committee said that...

905
01:15:48,437 --> 01:15:52,275
The research was some of the most original
that's ever been put before them...

906
01:15:52,859 --> 01:15:55,611
Einstein, Darwin, Du Barry?

907
01:15:57,321 --> 01:15:59,115
Most original.

908
01:16:00,241 --> 01:16:01,826
Wow, it's uh...

909
01:16:02,660 --> 01:16:05,246
It's a big compliment coming
from the pre-committee.

910
01:16:08,166 --> 01:16:09,458
[lady] No.

911
01:16:09,750 --> 01:16:11,085
Need for that.

912
01:16:11,294 --> 01:16:12,795
We'll take care of you.

913
01:16:13,337 --> 01:16:16,465
- Please, I need to call my daughter.
- Your daughter?

914
01:16:17,425 --> 01:16:20,094
I'm sure Laura isn't anxious.

915
01:16:20,803 --> 01:16:22,221
I'm quite sure.

916
01:16:23,681 --> 01:16:25,183
Where's dad?

917
01:16:26,392 --> 01:16:27,643
Dad?

918
01:16:27,977 --> 01:16:30,730
Mom, you're scaring me, maybe
we should get you to a hospital?

919
01:16:30,897 --> 01:16:35,193
I don't want to go to a hospital,
I just don't understand any of it.

920
01:16:36,277 --> 01:16:37,945
And that lovely painting.

921
01:16:38,779 --> 01:16:41,324
Of your late husband perhaps...

922
01:16:42,825 --> 01:16:45,036
Yes, there was a
terrible accident.

923
01:16:45,244 --> 01:16:47,246
He was a good looking
guy your husband...

924
01:16:49,582 --> 01:16:53,586
Of course... He wasn't
that good looking...

925
01:16:56,589 --> 01:16:59,300
- [police radio]
- [sirens]

926
01:16:59,967 --> 01:17:01,594
I had to get rid of Luke.

927
01:17:05,765 --> 01:17:08,559
My entire plan would
have crumbled...

928
01:17:09,268 --> 01:17:10,937
You do understand?

929
01:17:11,521 --> 01:17:12,688
Don't you?

930
01:17:13,564 --> 01:17:16,400
All those who have come to
realize there's no God, are here.

931
01:17:16,526 --> 01:17:18,694
Supporting you, on your journey.

932
01:17:18,778 --> 01:17:20,613
[mumbles]

933
01:17:21,030 --> 01:17:23,282
It's a pity about Laura.

934
01:17:32,250 --> 01:17:33,918
[sirens]

935
01:17:35,503 --> 01:17:37,922
[man chuckles]

936
01:17:38,548 --> 01:17:42,260
She was such a... Mmm...

937
01:17:43,427 --> 01:17:45,221
Charming child.

938
01:17:45,763 --> 01:17:46,973
But!

939
01:17:47,306 --> 01:17:50,059
You would have been spending
too much time with her and...

940
01:17:50,601 --> 01:17:52,478
I wanted you all
to myself, so...

941
01:17:52,562 --> 01:17:55,148
I decided to do her the
same time I did Noel.

942
01:17:55,523 --> 01:17:58,401
Sort of like a supermarket,
buy one get one free.

943
01:17:58,734 --> 01:18:00,194
[sobbing]

944
01:18:10,830 --> 01:18:12,874
[indistinctive radio]

945
01:18:14,750 --> 01:18:16,210
[chuckles]

946
01:18:16,294 --> 01:18:17,670
Oh!

947
01:18:19,714 --> 01:18:21,841
[man chuckles]

948
01:18:22,049 --> 01:18:24,218
Oh, I owe you, sugar.

949
01:18:24,635 --> 01:18:25,928
If it hadn't been for you...

950
01:18:26,262 --> 01:18:28,848
I might be still
repairing furnaces.

951
01:18:29,140 --> 01:18:30,975
[chuckles]

952
01:18:32,518 --> 01:18:34,020
Let me out!

953
01:18:34,103 --> 01:18:36,272
[chuckles] Now.

954
01:18:37,315 --> 01:18:41,611
Let's get down to doing what
us devil's really like doing.

955
01:18:52,997 --> 01:18:54,624
[door creaks]

956
01:19:03,382 --> 01:19:06,260
- [muffled screams]
- It's ok, relax.

957
01:19:07,762 --> 01:19:09,430
[screaming]

958
01:19:18,481 --> 01:19:20,191
[screaming in distance]

959
01:19:22,318 --> 01:19:23,694
[screaming]

960
01:19:24,195 --> 01:19:25,488
[screams loudly]

961
01:19:25,696 --> 01:19:27,281
[scream echoes]

962
01:19:40,545 --> 01:19:43,506
[suspenseful eerie music]

963
01:20:58,122 --> 01:20:59,832
[sobbing]

964
01:21:09,842 --> 01:21:11,594
[sobbing continues]

965
01:21:40,748 --> 01:21:42,834
[church bell rings]

966
01:22:08,401 --> 01:22:10,236
[light upbeat music]

967
01:24:17,822 --> 01:24:19,073
[music ends]
