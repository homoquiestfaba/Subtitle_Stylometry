1
00:03:00,424 --> 00:03:02,722
Amazing. This is amazing.

2
00:03:02,926 --> 00:03:06,225
Listen to this: The entire work
force of the state of Virginia...

3
00:03:06,430 --> 00:03:08,990
...had to have solitaire removed
from their computers...

4
00:03:09,499 --> 00:03:11,524
...because they hadn't done
any work in six weeks.

5
00:03:11,735 --> 00:03:12,565
That's so sad.

6
00:03:12,769 --> 00:03:14,464
Do you know what this is?

7
00:03:14,671 --> 00:03:17,697
The end of Western civilization
as we know it.

8
00:03:18,408 --> 00:03:19,568
Aren't you late?

9
00:03:19,776 --> 00:03:23,712
Technology. Name me one thing
that we've gained from technology.

10
00:03:23,914 --> 00:03:25,006
Electricity.

11
00:03:25,215 --> 00:03:28,878
That's one. You think this machine's
your friend, but it's not.

12
00:03:29,119 --> 00:03:30,211
I'm out of here.

13
00:03:30,420 --> 00:03:31,250
See you tonight!

14
00:03:31,455 --> 00:03:32,854
Sushi!

15
00:03:33,790 --> 00:03:35,018
Bye!

16
00:04:24,241 --> 00:04:25,230
Welcome.

17
00:04:27,511 --> 00:04:29,479
You've got mail.

18
00:04:38,588 --> 00:04:41,318
"Brinkley is my dog. He loves
New York streets as much as I do."

19
00:04:41,525 --> 00:04:44,426
Although he likes to eat bits
ofpizza and bagel off the sidewalk...

20
00:04:44,628 --> 00:04:45,595
...and I prefer to buy them.

21
00:04:46,763 --> 00:04:49,926
Brinkley is a great catcher who was
offered a tryout on the Mets.

22
00:04:50,133 --> 00:04:53,261
But he chose to stay with me
so he could spend 18 hours a day...

23
00:04:53,470 --> 00:04:56,837
...sleeping on a large green pillow
the size of an inner tube.

24
00:04:57,207 --> 00:04:59,038
Don't you love New York in the fall?

25
00:04:59,276 --> 00:05:01,710
Makes me want to buy school supplies.

26
00:05:02,145 --> 00:05:03,134
I'm almost ready.

27
00:05:03,346 --> 00:05:06,611
I would send you a bouquet
of newly sharpened pencils...

28
00:05:06,817 --> 00:05:09,149
...if I knew your name and address.

29
00:05:09,386 --> 00:05:13,015
On the other hand,
this not knowing has its charms.

30
00:05:13,223 --> 00:05:14,781
Did you push it?

31
00:05:14,991 --> 00:05:16,515
Yes, I pushed it.

32
00:05:17,027 --> 00:05:18,153
I'm so late.

33
00:05:19,996 --> 00:05:22,794
Random House fired Dick Atkins.
Good riddance.

34
00:05:23,033 --> 00:05:25,934
Murray Chilton died, which makes
one less person I'm not speaking to.

35
00:05:26,136 --> 00:05:27,626
Hurry! Hurry! Hurry!

36
00:05:31,241 --> 00:05:34,472
Vince got a great review.
He'll be insufferable.

37
00:05:34,878 --> 00:05:36,209
Tonight, PEN dinner.

38
00:05:37,480 --> 00:05:38,469
Am I going?

39
00:05:39,049 --> 00:05:39,879
Joe Fox, you promised.

40
00:05:41,751 --> 00:05:42,718
It's black-tie.

41
00:05:43,553 --> 00:05:45,544
Can't I just give money instead?

42
00:05:45,755 --> 00:05:47,985
What is it this week?
Free Albanian writers?

43
00:05:48,758 --> 00:05:49,884
I'm in favor of that.

44
00:05:53,396 --> 00:05:55,023
Okay, I'll go.

45
00:05:55,232 --> 00:05:56,221
I'll go. You're late.

46
00:05:56,433 --> 00:05:57,559
I know. I know.

47
00:06:31,601 --> 00:06:32,829
Who's a happy dog?

48
00:06:33,036 --> 00:06:34,765
Who's a happy dog?

49
00:06:41,211 --> 00:06:42,109
Welcome.

50
00:06:43,947 --> 00:06:45,608
You've got mail.

51
00:06:45,815 --> 00:06:48,215
All right. Okay.
Get down, get down.

52
00:06:51,788 --> 00:06:54,518
Dear friend, I like to start
my notes to you...

53
00:06:54,724 --> 00:06:56,988
...as if we're already
in the middle of a conversation.

54
00:06:57,227 --> 00:06:59,855
I pretend that we're the oldest
and dearest friends...

55
00:07:00,063 --> 00:07:01,621
...as opposed to what
we actually are:

56
00:07:02,098 --> 00:07:04,464
People who don't know
each other's names...

57
00:07:04,668 --> 00:07:07,796
...and met in a chat room where
we both claimed we'd never been before.

58
00:07:08,672 --> 00:07:11,971
"What will NY152 say today?" I wonder.

59
00:07:13,310 --> 00:07:15,175
I turn on my computer.

60
00:07:15,412 --> 00:07:18,142
I wait impatiently as it connects.

61
00:07:18,348 --> 00:07:20,111
I go online...

62
00:07:20,317 --> 00:07:24,913
...and my breath catches in my chest
until I hear 3 little words:

63
00:07:25,455 --> 00:07:26,649
"You've got mail. "

64
00:07:27,958 --> 00:07:31,792
I hear nothing, not even a sound
on the streets of New York.

65
00:07:31,995 --> 00:07:34,122
Just the beat of my own heart.

66
00:07:34,364 --> 00:07:36,093
I have mail...

67
00:07:36,333 --> 00:07:37,595
...from you.

68
00:08:38,661 --> 00:08:41,596
The electrical contractor called.
His truck hit a deer last night.

69
00:08:41,831 --> 00:08:43,594
So he won't be here till tomorrow.

70
00:08:43,833 --> 00:08:45,801
And upstairs the shelves are late...

71
00:08:46,002 --> 00:08:47,902
...because the pine
we ordered has beetles.

72
00:08:48,104 --> 00:08:49,002
Very good.

73
00:08:49,205 --> 00:08:52,333
And we got a $50,000 ticket
for workers peeing off the roof.

74
00:08:52,842 --> 00:08:53,706
Great.

75
00:08:53,910 --> 00:08:54,774
That is great.

76
00:08:55,011 --> 00:08:56,410
Is the electrician here today?

77
00:08:56,613 --> 00:09:00,344
I just told you he hit a deer.
I knew you weren't listening to me.

78
00:09:01,351 --> 00:09:02,215
You're right.

79
00:09:02,419 --> 00:09:03,317
I wasn't.

80
00:09:03,520 --> 00:09:05,147
I hear nothing. Nothing.

81
00:09:05,355 --> 00:09:08,756
Not a sound on the city streets,
just the beat of my own heart.

82
00:09:08,958 --> 00:09:11,950
I think that's how it goes.
Something like that.

83
00:09:12,429 --> 00:09:13,760
You and Patricia got engaged.

84
00:09:14,564 --> 00:09:15,553
You can tell me.

85
00:09:15,765 --> 00:09:16,789
Engaged?

86
00:09:17,033 --> 00:09:18,125
Are you crazy?

87
00:09:18,368 --> 00:09:19,494
I thought you liked Patricia.

88
00:09:20,103 --> 00:09:21,195
I do. I do.

89
00:09:21,404 --> 00:09:24,237
I love Patricia. I love Patricia.

90
00:09:24,441 --> 00:09:27,467
Patricia is amazing.
Patricia makes coffee nervous.

91
00:09:27,710 --> 00:09:31,612
We should announce ourselves to
the neighborhood. "Here we come."

92
00:09:31,815 --> 00:09:33,612
I don't know, this is
the Upper West Side.

93
00:09:33,817 --> 00:09:36,115
We might as well tell them
we're opening a crack house.

94
00:09:36,319 --> 00:09:37,479
They're going to hate us.

95
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:39,915
Soon as they hear,
they'll be lining up...

96
00:09:40,123 --> 00:09:41,590
...to picket the big bad chain store.

97
00:09:41,791 --> 00:09:42,883
That's out to destroy--

98
00:09:43,093 --> 00:09:44,219
Everything they hold dear.

99
00:09:44,427 --> 00:09:47,954
We're going to seduce them
with our square footage...

100
00:09:48,164 --> 00:09:51,827
...and our discounts,
and our deep armchairs...

101
00:09:52,068 --> 00:09:53,899
...and our cappuccino.

102
00:09:54,104 --> 00:09:56,572
That's right. They're going
to hate us at the beginning...

103
00:09:56,806 --> 00:09:58,706
...but we'll get them in the end.

104
00:09:58,908 --> 00:09:59,806
And you know why?

105
00:10:00,009 --> 00:10:01,135
Why?

106
00:10:01,344 --> 00:10:04,575
Because we'll sell them cheap books
and legal addictive stimulants.

107
00:10:04,781 --> 00:10:07,579
In the meantime,
we'll just put up a big sign:

108
00:10:07,917 --> 00:10:11,011
"Coming soon, a Fox Books Superstore.
The End of Civilization...

109
00:10:11,254 --> 00:10:12,243
...As You Know lt!"

110
00:10:16,759 --> 00:10:17,987
Good morning, Christina.

111
00:10:18,194 --> 00:10:19,752
Good morning, kathleen.

112
00:10:19,963 --> 00:10:23,330
It's a beautiful day. Isn't it
just the most beautiful day?

113
00:10:23,633 --> 00:10:25,430
I guess. Yeah, sure.

114
00:10:27,437 --> 00:10:28,461
Idiot, what are you doing?

115
00:10:28,671 --> 00:10:30,434
Where you going?
I got the green light!

116
00:10:30,773 --> 00:10:32,968
Don't you just love
New York in the fall?

117
00:10:41,217 --> 00:10:42,445
Perfect.

118
00:10:50,827 --> 00:10:51,816
Can't beat that.

119
00:10:52,028 --> 00:10:54,826
Scotch tape?
What is going on with you?

120
00:10:55,031 --> 00:10:56,521
Nothing.

121
00:10:57,233 --> 00:10:58,063
You're in love.

122
00:10:58,301 --> 00:10:59,859
In love? No.

123
00:11:01,171 --> 00:11:05,198
Yes. That's right.
I'm in love with Frank.

124
00:11:05,408 --> 00:11:08,206
I'm practically living with Frank.

125
00:11:09,646 --> 00:11:12,012
Could you get our
Christmas mailers out this week?

126
00:11:12,215 --> 00:11:14,308
Yeah, by Monday. I promise.

127
00:11:14,517 --> 00:11:16,985
I have this paper due Friday.

128
00:11:19,422 --> 00:11:20,719
What is going on?

129
00:11:21,357 --> 00:11:23,222
Nothing. Nothing at all.

130
00:11:23,426 --> 00:11:27,726
You know, I am just going to
stand here until you tell me.

131
00:11:28,498 --> 00:11:29,487
All right.

132
00:11:29,699 --> 00:11:32,566
Is it infidelity if you're involved
with someone on e-mail?

133
00:11:33,002 --> 00:11:34,435
Have you had sex?

134
00:11:34,671 --> 00:11:36,536
No, of course not.
I don't even know him.

135
00:11:36,739 --> 00:11:38,366
I mean cybersex.

136
00:11:39,375 --> 00:11:44,108
Don't do it. The minute you do,
they lose all respect for you.

137
00:11:44,948 --> 00:11:46,882
It's not like that.

138
00:11:47,083 --> 00:11:48,744
We just e-mail.
It's really nothing.

139
00:11:48,952 --> 00:11:53,082
On top of which, I'm thinking of
stopping, because it's getting....

140
00:11:53,289 --> 00:11:54,620
Out of hand?

141
00:11:55,358 --> 00:11:56,916
Confusing.

142
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:58,192
But not.

143
00:11:58,394 --> 00:11:59,793
Because it's nothing.

144
00:12:00,029 --> 00:12:01,155
Where'd you meet him?

145
00:12:01,364 --> 00:12:03,457
Listen, I can't even remember.

146
00:12:09,372 --> 00:12:11,772
On my birthday, I wandered
into the "over 30" room...

147
00:12:11,975 --> 00:12:13,738
...for a joke, sort of.

148
00:12:14,377 --> 00:12:16,311
And he was there.
And we started chatting.

149
00:12:16,546 --> 00:12:18,070
About what?

150
00:12:18,748 --> 00:12:22,206
Books and music, how much
we both love New York....

151
00:12:22,418 --> 00:12:23,612
Harmless, harmless.

152
00:12:23,820 --> 00:12:25,151
Meaningless.

153
00:12:25,488 --> 00:12:28,116
Bouquets of sharpened pencils.

154
00:12:28,725 --> 00:12:29,714
Excuse me?

155
00:12:30,059 --> 00:12:30,923
Forget it.

156
00:12:31,127 --> 00:12:34,722
We don't talk about anything personal,
so I don't know his name...

157
00:12:34,931 --> 00:12:37,058
...or what he does
or where he lives exactly...

158
00:12:37,267 --> 00:12:41,727
...so it'll be easy for me to stop
seeing him, because I'm not.

159
00:12:42,438 --> 00:12:45,635
God. He could be the next person
to walk into the store.

160
00:12:45,842 --> 00:12:46,706
I know.

161
00:12:46,909 --> 00:12:48,001
He could be...

162
00:12:51,414 --> 00:12:52,847
...George.

163
00:12:55,251 --> 00:12:56,309
Morning.

164
00:12:56,619 --> 00:12:58,644
Are you online?

165
00:12:58,855 --> 00:13:00,823
As far as I'm concerned...

166
00:13:01,024 --> 00:13:04,619
...the lnternet is just another way
of being rejected by a woman.

167
00:13:08,898 --> 00:13:10,490
Good morning, Birdie.

168
00:13:11,801 --> 00:13:13,860
What are you girls talking about?

169
00:13:14,203 --> 00:13:15,431
Cybersex.

170
00:13:15,772 --> 00:13:18,900
I tried to have cybersex once,
but I kept getting a busy signal.

171
00:13:19,108 --> 00:13:20,040
I know.

172
00:13:20,243 --> 00:13:23,235
I know. I was really depressed
one Saturday night about 9:00--

173
00:13:23,446 --> 00:13:25,038
Time to open up.

174
00:13:29,719 --> 00:13:32,119
Jessica and Maya, how are you today?

175
00:13:32,355 --> 00:13:35,688
-Want to say hi to kathleen?
-Hi, kathleen.

176
00:13:37,126 --> 00:13:38,616
May I help you?

177
00:13:40,663 --> 00:13:42,824
Construction's going well.
We should open on time.

178
00:13:43,032 --> 00:13:45,466
Although kevin and I
are both a little concerned...

179
00:13:45,668 --> 00:13:47,431
...about the neighborhood response.

180
00:13:47,637 --> 00:13:50,663
This fabric on the couch,
what is it? Does it have a name?

181
00:13:50,873 --> 00:13:51,862
Money.

182
00:13:52,909 --> 00:13:54,809
Its name is money.

183
00:13:55,144 --> 00:13:56,372
Gillian selected it.

184
00:13:56,579 --> 00:13:57,409
Good guess.

185
00:13:57,647 --> 00:13:58,944
Your father's getting married again.

186
00:13:59,148 --> 00:14:00,012
Really?

187
00:14:00,383 --> 00:14:01,816
-Congratulations.
-Thank you.

188
00:14:02,018 --> 00:14:02,677
Why?

189
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:03,681
Who knows?

190
00:14:03,886 --> 00:14:04,545
Love?

191
00:14:04,754 --> 00:14:05,686
Possible.

192
00:14:05,888 --> 00:14:07,446
I think you're a damn fool.

193
00:14:07,690 --> 00:14:09,783
Pops, Matthew is
four years old, okay?

194
00:14:09,992 --> 00:14:12,460
It'd be nice for him if he knew
his parents were married.

195
00:14:12,995 --> 00:14:15,828
Listen, I have a
sad announcement to make.

196
00:14:16,566 --> 00:14:17,828
City Books...

197
00:14:18,034 --> 00:14:19,262
...on 23rd Street?

198
00:14:19,502 --> 00:14:20,628
It's going under.

199
00:14:26,008 --> 00:14:28,101
Another independent bites the dust.

200
00:14:28,344 --> 00:14:29,675
On to the next!

201
00:14:30,012 --> 00:14:33,277
Going to buy out their entire
inventory of architecture...

202
00:14:33,516 --> 00:14:35,211
...and New York history
for the new store.

203
00:14:35,451 --> 00:14:37,214
How much, son?
How much you paying?

204
00:14:37,420 --> 00:14:39,513
Whatever it costs,
it won't be as much...

205
00:14:39,722 --> 00:14:41,986
...as that exquisitely uncomfortable
mohair episode there.

206
00:14:42,191 --> 00:14:43,385
Which is now all over my suit.

207
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:45,754
Here you go.

208
00:14:47,363 --> 00:14:48,796
We're also going to have
a section...

209
00:14:48,998 --> 00:14:51,364
...dedicated just to writers
who've lived on the West Side.

210
00:14:51,567 --> 00:14:53,125
As a shot to the neighborhood.

211
00:14:53,369 --> 00:14:56,668
Perfect. keep those West Side
liberalnuts, pseudo-intellectual--

212
00:14:56,873 --> 00:14:59,103
Readers, Dad.
They're called readers.

213
00:14:59,308 --> 00:15:01,902
Don't romanticize them.
It'll keep them...

214
00:15:02,111 --> 00:15:03,669
...from jumping down your throat.

215
00:15:03,880 --> 00:15:04,812
What's the competition?

216
00:15:05,448 --> 00:15:09,248
One mystery store, Sleuth,
at 78th and Amsterdam...

217
00:15:09,452 --> 00:15:11,920
...and a children's bookstore,
Shop Around The Corner.

218
00:15:12,155 --> 00:15:13,349
Been there forever.

219
00:15:13,556 --> 00:15:14,853
Cecilia's store.

220
00:15:15,725 --> 00:15:16,589
Who's that?

221
00:15:17,427 --> 00:15:18,985
Cecilia kelly.

222
00:15:19,228 --> 00:15:22,527
Lovely woman. I think we might
have had a date once.

223
00:15:22,965 --> 00:15:25,058
Or maybe we just exchanged letters.

224
00:15:26,302 --> 00:15:27,769
You wrote her letters?

225
00:15:28,404 --> 00:15:31,032
Mail. It was called mail.

226
00:15:31,574 --> 00:15:32,871
Stamps, envelopes--

227
00:15:33,075 --> 00:15:34,007
You know, I've heard of it.

228
00:15:34,243 --> 00:15:37,041
Cecilia had beautiful penmanship.

229
00:15:37,246 --> 00:15:39,714
She was too young for me...

230
00:15:40,249 --> 00:15:41,477
...but she was...

231
00:15:41,684 --> 00:15:42,742
...enchanting.

232
00:15:43,486 --> 00:15:44,282
Enchanting?

233
00:15:44,487 --> 00:15:46,114
Her daughter owns it now.

234
00:15:46,923 --> 00:15:48,584
Too bad for her.

235
00:15:51,427 --> 00:15:52,860
Excuse me, Mr. Fox.

236
00:15:53,095 --> 00:15:54,790
My father is getting
married again.

237
00:15:55,097 --> 00:15:57,588
For 5 years, he's been living
with a woman named Gillian...

238
00:15:57,800 --> 00:16:00,098
...who studied decorating
at Caesar's Palace.

239
00:16:00,336 --> 00:16:01,496
Is it porcelain?

240
00:16:02,138 --> 00:16:03,105
Rubber.

241
00:16:04,941 --> 00:16:07,637
Once I read a story about a
butterfly in the subway, and today...

242
00:16:08,277 --> 00:16:09,710
...l saw one.

243
00:16:09,946 --> 00:16:10,970
It got on at 42nd...

244
00:16:11,214 --> 00:16:12,704
...and off at 59th...

245
00:16:12,949 --> 00:16:14,541
...where I assume it went
to Bloomingdale's...

246
00:16:14,784 --> 00:16:16,911
...to buy a hat that will
turn out to be a mistake.

247
00:16:17,119 --> 00:16:19,349
As almost all hats are.

248
00:16:21,190 --> 00:16:22,054
Listen to this:

249
00:16:22,291 --> 00:16:24,987
Every night a truck pulls up
to my neighborhood bagel place...

250
00:16:25,228 --> 00:16:28,026
...and pumps about a ton of flour
into underground tanks.

251
00:16:28,231 --> 00:16:29,664
Then the air is filled...

252
00:16:29,866 --> 00:16:32,130
...with white dust
which never seems to land.

253
00:16:32,368 --> 00:16:33,892
Why is that?

254
00:16:35,037 --> 00:16:39,167
Confession: I have read
Pride and Prejudice about 200 times.

255
00:16:40,309 --> 00:16:42,402
I get lost in the language.
Words like...

256
00:16:42,645 --> 00:16:43,771
... "thither. "

257
00:16:43,980 --> 00:16:45,811
"Mischance. "

258
00:16:46,048 --> 00:16:47,709
"Felicity. "

259
00:16:48,484 --> 00:16:51,044
I'm always in agony over whether
Elizabeth and Mr. Darcy...

260
00:16:51,254 --> 00:16:53,620
...are really going to get together.

261
00:16:53,823 --> 00:16:55,051
Read it.

262
00:16:55,258 --> 00:16:57,317
I know you'll love it.

263
00:16:58,828 --> 00:17:00,591
The whole purpose ofplaces
like Starbucks...

264
00:17:00,830 --> 00:17:03,264
...is for people with no
decision-making ability whatsoever...

265
00:17:03,499 --> 00:17:07,162
...to make six decisions
just to buy one cup of coffee.

266
00:17:07,403 --> 00:17:09,428
Short, tall, lite, dark...

267
00:17:09,672 --> 00:17:11,401
...caf, decaf...

268
00:17:11,607 --> 00:17:12,437
...low-fat, nonfat...

269
00:17:13,609 --> 00:17:15,076
...et cetera.

270
00:17:15,578 --> 00:17:17,273
Mocha frappuccino grande.

271
00:17:17,513 --> 00:17:19,913
So people who don't know
what the hell they're doing...

272
00:17:20,116 --> 00:17:22,983
...or who on earth they are
can, for only $2.95...

273
00:17:23,185 --> 00:17:25,312
...get notjust a cup of coffee...

274
00:17:25,521 --> 00:17:29,184
...but an absolutely
defining sense of self.

275
00:17:30,426 --> 00:17:31,586
Tall.

276
00:17:31,794 --> 00:17:32,818
Decaf.

277
00:17:33,029 --> 00:17:34,257
Cappuccino.

278
00:17:34,463 --> 00:17:36,192
Tall decaf cappuccino.

279
00:17:57,887 --> 00:17:59,218
Bummer.

280
00:18:01,390 --> 00:18:03,551
A Fox Books Superstore.

281
00:18:03,859 --> 00:18:06,157
Quel nightmare.

282
00:18:06,362 --> 00:18:08,762
It has nothing to do with us.
It's big...

283
00:18:08,998 --> 00:18:10,022
...impersonal...

284
00:18:10,232 --> 00:18:13,429
...overstocked and full
of ignorant salespeople.

285
00:18:13,736 --> 00:18:15,397
But they discount.

286
00:18:15,605 --> 00:18:17,596
But they don't provide any service.

287
00:18:17,840 --> 00:18:19,171
We do.

288
00:18:19,375 --> 00:18:20,672
So really...

289
00:18:20,876 --> 00:18:22,537
...it's a good development.

290
00:18:22,745 --> 00:18:25,805
You know how in the flower district
there are all those flower shops...

291
00:18:26,015 --> 00:18:27,642
...so you can find whatever you want?

292
00:18:27,850 --> 00:18:28,714
Well...

293
00:18:28,918 --> 00:18:31,716
...this is going to be
the book district.

294
00:18:31,921 --> 00:18:33,445
If they don't have it, we do.

295
00:18:34,724 --> 00:18:36,021
And vice versa.

296
00:18:36,292 --> 00:18:37,281
Absolutely.

297
00:18:41,030 --> 00:18:43,260
When you are finished
with Fox Books...

298
00:18:43,466 --> 00:18:46,799
...The Shop Around The Corner
is going to be responsible...

299
00:18:47,036 --> 00:18:51,234
...for reversing the entire course
of the lndustrial Revolution.

300
00:18:51,440 --> 00:18:54,238
Well, now, that is so sweet.

301
00:18:54,443 --> 00:18:57,173
Thank you. That is so sweet.

302
00:18:57,380 --> 00:18:58,210
Although l--

303
00:18:58,414 --> 00:18:59,244
What?

304
00:18:59,448 --> 00:19:01,177
Wait a minute.
What is that doing here?

305
00:19:01,384 --> 00:19:02,715
Oh, my gosh...

306
00:19:02,885 --> 00:19:04,409
...this is amazing.

307
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:05,814
Listen.

308
00:19:07,790 --> 00:19:10,088
The Olympia Report Deluxe Electric.

309
00:19:10,393 --> 00:19:11,382
Report.

310
00:19:11,661 --> 00:19:12,992
As in gunshot.

311
00:19:13,229 --> 00:19:15,789
-That sound is familiar.
-Listen to this.

312
00:19:16,732 --> 00:19:18,290
What, that whirring?

313
00:19:18,567 --> 00:19:20,797
The gentle, soothing lullaby...

314
00:19:21,003 --> 00:19:23,563
...of a piece of machinery so perfect--

315
00:19:23,773 --> 00:19:25,934
I know where I've heard that before.

316
00:19:27,643 --> 00:19:28,541
I needed a backup.

317
00:19:28,744 --> 00:19:30,803
Don't you have another one of these
at your apartment?

318
00:19:31,013 --> 00:19:32,913
-I might!
-That you wrote a column about?

319
00:19:33,115 --> 00:19:34,082
Who cares?

320
00:19:35,151 --> 00:19:36,516
What were you going to say?

321
00:19:36,752 --> 00:19:37,650
-When?
-Before.

322
00:19:37,853 --> 00:19:38,683
Nothing.

323
00:19:39,588 --> 00:19:40,418
Come on.

324
00:19:42,658 --> 00:19:46,094
I'm just wondering.
I'm wondering about my work.

325
00:19:47,596 --> 00:19:49,894
I mean, what is it that I do, exactly?

326
00:19:50,099 --> 00:19:51,623
All I really do is--

327
00:19:51,834 --> 00:19:53,426
All you really do...

328
00:19:53,636 --> 00:19:55,831
...is this incredibly noble thing.

329
00:19:56,038 --> 00:19:56,868
I don't know.

330
00:19:57,106 --> 00:19:59,336
Really, I'm just--

331
00:20:00,376 --> 00:20:01,934
You are a lone reed.

332
00:20:03,713 --> 00:20:05,203
You are a lone...

333
00:20:07,016 --> 00:20:08,210
...reed...

334
00:20:08,451 --> 00:20:09,941
...standing...

335
00:20:10,152 --> 00:20:11,585
...tall...

336
00:20:11,787 --> 00:20:13,778
...waving boldly...

337
00:20:14,290 --> 00:20:16,520
...in the corrupt sands...

338
00:20:16,726 --> 00:20:18,125
...of commerce.

339
00:20:21,464 --> 00:20:22,829
I am a lone reed.

340
00:20:25,000 --> 00:20:27,901
I am a lone reed.

341
00:20:33,976 --> 00:20:36,570
Sometimes I wonder about my life.

342
00:20:36,912 --> 00:20:39,176
I lead a small life.

343
00:20:39,548 --> 00:20:41,516
Well, valuable, but small.

344
00:20:41,717 --> 00:20:43,378
And sometimes I wonder...

345
00:20:43,586 --> 00:20:45,713
...do I do it because I like it?

346
00:20:45,921 --> 00:20:48,355
Or because I haven't been brave?

347
00:20:49,158 --> 00:20:52,650
So much of what I see reminds me
of something I read in a book...

348
00:20:52,862 --> 00:20:55,160
...when, shouldn't it be
the other way around?

349
00:20:56,031 --> 00:20:57,430
I don't really want an answer.

350
00:20:57,666 --> 00:21:01,363
Ijust want to send this
cosmic question out into the void.

351
00:21:01,937 --> 00:21:03,234
So...

352
00:21:03,506 --> 00:21:05,770
...good night, dear void.

353
00:21:15,384 --> 00:21:16,942
I know you!

354
00:21:18,854 --> 00:21:19,821
I know you.

355
00:21:20,022 --> 00:21:21,853
Hello, Annabel, little girl.

356
00:21:22,258 --> 00:21:23,282
How are you?

357
00:21:23,526 --> 00:21:24,754
And you.

358
00:21:25,027 --> 00:21:26,619
Matthew, how are you?

359
00:21:27,029 --> 00:21:28,018
Good.

360
00:21:28,230 --> 00:21:29,959
Ready to say hello to New Jersey?

361
00:21:30,199 --> 00:21:32,565
Hello, New Jersey!

362
00:21:34,537 --> 00:21:35,629
Don't I get a "hello"?

363
00:21:37,373 --> 00:21:38,362
Hello, Gillian.

364
00:21:39,141 --> 00:21:41,871
kiss me. I'm going to be
your wicked stepmother.

365
00:21:45,147 --> 00:21:46,079
There you go.

366
00:21:46,315 --> 00:21:47,873
Hello. And who is this?

367
00:21:48,818 --> 00:21:51,787
Nanny Maureen. I brought her in case
you couldn't handle the kids.

368
00:21:52,354 --> 00:21:53,981
Maureen's getting a divorce.

369
00:21:55,391 --> 00:21:56,449
I'm sorry to hear that.

370
00:21:56,992 --> 00:21:58,459
It's my own fault.

371
00:21:58,661 --> 00:22:01,425
Never marry a man who lies.

372
00:22:02,064 --> 00:22:04,589
That is so wise. Yes.
Annabel, remember that.

373
00:22:04,867 --> 00:22:06,494
She taught Matt how to
spell his name.

374
00:22:07,002 --> 00:22:08,060
Really?

375
00:22:08,270 --> 00:22:09,828
-Let's hear it.
-F-O-X.

376
00:22:10,072 --> 00:22:11,437
Excellent.

377
00:22:11,640 --> 00:22:15,041
Excellent. I've got this covered.
You can have the day off.

378
00:22:15,244 --> 00:22:18,839
And you must be late for something.
Volunteering, rolling bandages...

379
00:22:19,081 --> 00:22:20,480
...for Bosnian refugees.

380
00:22:20,683 --> 00:22:23,914
I am. I'm having
my eggs harvested.

381
00:22:25,454 --> 00:22:28,082
And getting those eggs harvested.
Don't worry about a thing.

382
00:22:28,290 --> 00:22:29,348
See you later.

383
00:22:30,259 --> 00:22:31,248
Bye, Mom.

384
00:22:31,460 --> 00:22:35,692
All right, you guys, are you ready
to go out on the boat?

385
00:22:36,999 --> 00:22:39,160
What happened to you?
What happened?

386
00:22:54,316 --> 00:22:56,375
Come on. You stink.
One more time.

387
00:22:56,619 --> 00:22:58,280
Here, you can do that one.

388
00:23:02,224 --> 00:23:03,782
What do we win?

389
00:23:15,804 --> 00:23:17,135
Look, look, look!

390
00:23:52,007 --> 00:23:54,669
-How are the fish?
-They're very well. Very happy.

391
00:23:54,877 --> 00:23:56,105
Are they?

392
00:23:56,345 --> 00:23:58,245
You guys want to go to a movie?

393
00:23:58,447 --> 00:24:00,108
There's nothing good playing.

394
00:24:00,349 --> 00:24:02,544
Look, the storybook lady.

395
00:24:03,185 --> 00:24:06,245
Are we at the right time?
Yeah, let's go.

396
00:24:06,522 --> 00:24:08,547
"That it was I and I alone...

397
00:24:09,391 --> 00:24:12,883
...who had the idea for the great
and daring mouse plot.

398
00:24:13,095 --> 00:24:15,359
We all have our moments
of brilliance and glory...

399
00:24:15,564 --> 00:24:17,862
...and this was mine.

400
00:24:18,067 --> 00:24:19,125
'Why don't we,' I said...

401
00:24:19,335 --> 00:24:23,135
...'slip it into one of
Mrs. Pratchett's jars of sweets?

402
00:24:23,472 --> 00:24:24,461
And then...

403
00:24:24,707 --> 00:24:27,369
...when she puts her dirty hand in
to grab a handful...

404
00:24:27,576 --> 00:24:32,104
...she will grab a stinky,
dead mouse instead.'

405
00:24:32,314 --> 00:24:34,612
The other four stared at me in wonder.

406
00:24:34,817 --> 00:24:38,913
Then, as the sheer genius
of the plot began to sink in...

407
00:24:39,121 --> 00:24:41,248
...they all started grinning.

408
00:24:41,457 --> 00:24:43,789
They slapped me on the back.
They cheered me.

409
00:24:43,993 --> 00:24:45,460
They danced around the classroom.

410
00:24:45,661 --> 00:24:47,219
'We will do it today!' they cried.

411
00:24:47,429 --> 00:24:50,421
'We'll do it on the way home.
You had the idea,' they said to me.

412
00:24:50,632 --> 00:24:52,964
'So you can be the one who
puts the mouse in the jar.' "

413
00:24:56,572 --> 00:24:58,233
Who belongs to this fish?

414
00:24:58,440 --> 00:24:59,566
That's mine.

415
00:24:59,808 --> 00:25:02,242
Could you give me a hand
with these used books?

416
00:25:03,078 --> 00:25:04,909
And this is her best friend Tacy...

417
00:25:05,080 --> 00:25:06,479
...whose real name is Anastasia.

418
00:25:06,682 --> 00:25:09,947
And the next book, Betsy and Tacy
become friends with Tib...

419
00:25:10,152 --> 00:25:13,451
...whose real name, I am sorry
to tell you, is Thelma.

420
00:25:15,090 --> 00:25:17,854
The illustrations are hand-tipped.

421
00:25:18,527 --> 00:25:20,688
And that's why it costs so much?

422
00:25:21,096 --> 00:25:22,996
No, that's why it's worth so much.

423
00:25:23,198 --> 00:25:25,166
I want all of them.

424
00:25:25,367 --> 00:25:26,459
I'll think about it.

425
00:25:26,668 --> 00:25:28,431
That's a lot for your dad
to buy at one time.

426
00:25:28,704 --> 00:25:30,934
My dad gets me all the books I want.

427
00:25:31,140 --> 00:25:32,334
That's very nice of him.

428
00:25:33,242 --> 00:25:34,834
That's not my dad.
That's my nephew.

429
00:25:35,978 --> 00:25:39,470
I don't really think
that he could be your nephew.

430
00:25:39,948 --> 00:25:40,778
It's true.

431
00:25:40,983 --> 00:25:45,716
Annabel is my aunt.
Isn't that right, Aunt Annabel?

432
00:25:47,122 --> 00:25:47,952
And Matt is his--

433
00:25:48,157 --> 00:25:50,284
Wait, wait, let me guess.

434
00:25:50,492 --> 00:25:52,460
Are you his uncle?

435
00:25:52,661 --> 00:25:53,958
No.

436
00:25:54,129 --> 00:25:55,562
His grandfather?

437
00:25:57,132 --> 00:25:58,565
His great-grandfather?

438
00:25:58,867 --> 00:26:00,459
I'm his brother.

439
00:26:02,337 --> 00:26:04,202
Matt is my father's son.

440
00:26:04,406 --> 00:26:06,306
Annabel is my grandfather's daughter.

441
00:26:07,309 --> 00:26:08,833
We are...

442
00:26:09,645 --> 00:26:11,408
...an American family.

443
00:26:17,252 --> 00:26:18,184
Here you go, young lady.

444
00:26:18,387 --> 00:26:19,479
What's that?

445
00:26:19,822 --> 00:26:21,346
That's a handkerchief.

446
00:26:21,723 --> 00:26:23,816
Do children not even know
what handkerchiefs are?

447
00:26:24,026 --> 00:26:27,052
A handkerchief is a kleenex
you don't throw away. You see?

448
00:26:27,863 --> 00:26:29,660
My mother embroidered this for me.

449
00:26:29,832 --> 00:26:33,324
My initials and a daisy, because
daisies are my favorite flower.

450
00:26:34,336 --> 00:26:36,236
May I ask who you are?

451
00:26:36,872 --> 00:26:39,102
kathleen kelly. I own this store.

452
00:26:39,341 --> 00:26:40,273
And you are?

453
00:26:41,510 --> 00:26:43,501
Joe. Just call me Joe.

454
00:26:43,712 --> 00:26:45,077
We'll take these books.

455
00:26:47,249 --> 00:26:49,012
You're going to come back,
aren't you?

456
00:26:51,553 --> 00:26:52,542
Of course.

457
00:26:52,754 --> 00:26:53,584
See?

458
00:26:53,789 --> 00:26:55,279
That is why we won't go under.

459
00:26:55,524 --> 00:26:56,684
Our customers are loyal.

460
00:26:56,859 --> 00:26:58,952
They're opening a Fox Books
around the corner.

461
00:26:59,194 --> 00:27:00,126
Fox Books!

462
00:27:00,329 --> 00:27:02,297
-My daddy--
-Likes to buy discount.

463
00:27:02,531 --> 00:27:04,465
Don't tell anybody.
It's nothing to be proud of.

464
00:27:05,033 --> 00:27:06,694
F-O-X.

465
00:27:06,969 --> 00:27:09,369
That's amazing. You can spell fox.

466
00:27:10,372 --> 00:27:12,465
Can you spell dog?

467
00:27:12,774 --> 00:27:13,866
F-O-X.

468
00:27:14,042 --> 00:27:16,704
Look at this dinosaur book.
It's a pop-up dinosaur book.

469
00:27:16,979 --> 00:27:19,470
Wouldn't you like to have
a dinosaur book like that?

470
00:27:19,648 --> 00:27:22,116
Wouldn't you like to read that?

471
00:27:22,384 --> 00:27:25,717
Sit here and read Matt the book
until I take care of things.

472
00:27:25,921 --> 00:27:30,381
Whatever you do, just don't listen
to anything I say. Thank you.

473
00:27:31,093 --> 00:27:33,561
We'll take that pop-up book as well.
The dinosaur one.

474
00:27:33,729 --> 00:27:35,822
The world is not driven
by discounts, believe me.

475
00:27:36,064 --> 00:27:37,827
I have been in business forever.

476
00:27:38,066 --> 00:27:40,864
I started helping my mother
after school here when I was six...

477
00:27:41,069 --> 00:27:42,229
...and I used to watch her.

478
00:27:42,804 --> 00:27:45,466
It wasn't that she was just selling
books. It was that she was...

479
00:27:45,674 --> 00:27:48,666
...helping people become whoever
they were going to turn out to be.

480
00:27:48,911 --> 00:27:51,345
When you read a book as a child,
it becomes part of your identity...

481
00:27:51,547 --> 00:27:54,277
...in a way that no other reading
in your whole life does.

482
00:27:54,483 --> 00:27:56,417
And I have gotten carried away.

483
00:27:59,588 --> 00:28:01,249
Yeah, you have.

484
00:28:01,657 --> 00:28:03,784
You've made me feel....

485
00:28:06,628 --> 00:28:09,426
Enchanting.
Your mother was enchanting.

486
00:28:09,598 --> 00:28:10,690
Yes, she was.

487
00:28:11,133 --> 00:28:12,430
How will you pay for this?

488
00:28:13,101 --> 00:28:13,999
Cash.

489
00:28:14,603 --> 00:28:15,831
How did you know that?

490
00:28:16,838 --> 00:28:17,998
From the photograph.

491
00:28:19,007 --> 00:28:21,271
That you in the photograph?
What are you doing?

492
00:28:21,643 --> 00:28:22,940
Twirling.

493
00:28:24,179 --> 00:28:26,340
My mother and I used to twirl.

494
00:28:26,548 --> 00:28:30,177
Anyway, she left the store to me,
and I'll leave it to my daughter.

495
00:28:30,385 --> 00:28:31,943
-$73, please.
-How much?

496
00:28:32,187 --> 00:28:33,176
$73.

497
00:28:36,458 --> 00:28:39,450
How old is your daughter now?

498
00:28:40,796 --> 00:28:42,457
I don't have a daughter.

499
00:28:42,798 --> 00:28:43,890
I'm not married.

500
00:28:44,132 --> 00:28:45,463
But eventually....

501
00:28:45,701 --> 00:28:49,034
So the big bad Fox Books
can just go to hell.

502
00:28:50,806 --> 00:28:51,864
Here you go.

503
00:28:52,140 --> 00:28:54,165
Thank you. We're ready?

504
00:28:55,711 --> 00:28:57,338
This is nice.

505
00:28:57,980 --> 00:29:01,040
Goodbye, Annabel.
Goodbye, Matt.

506
00:29:04,853 --> 00:29:07,651
Matt, you know what?
I have to ask you another thing.

507
00:29:07,823 --> 00:29:09,313
Can you spell cat?

508
00:29:09,558 --> 00:29:11,355
F-O-X.

509
00:29:11,560 --> 00:29:12,891
F-O-X.

510
00:29:13,829 --> 00:29:16,059
Cat. Thanks.

511
00:29:19,067 --> 00:29:20,329
Good thing it wasn't the fish.

512
00:29:22,671 --> 00:29:24,161
Take care!

513
00:30:11,286 --> 00:30:14,050
No protests. No demonstrations.

514
00:30:14,222 --> 00:30:15,780
The neighborhood loves us.

515
00:30:16,058 --> 00:30:18,151
They're wondering where
we've been all these years.

516
00:30:18,393 --> 00:30:19,883
Wondering how they did without us.

517
00:30:20,062 --> 00:30:21,120
It's a hit!

518
00:30:21,330 --> 00:30:23,059
How's the children's department?

519
00:30:23,231 --> 00:30:25,096
It's early yet. School's not out.

520
00:30:25,300 --> 00:30:28,463
And there is that children's store
nearby. Shop Around The Corner.

521
00:30:28,737 --> 00:30:31,262
Cecilia's store. Cecilia kelly.

522
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:33,304
I think we might have had
a date once.

523
00:30:33,508 --> 00:30:34,805
Her daughter owns it now.

524
00:30:35,010 --> 00:30:36,068
We'll crush it!

525
00:30:36,278 --> 00:30:38,007
She was enchanting.

526
00:30:43,919 --> 00:30:46,012
They've been open 6 days.
And we did...

527
00:30:46,254 --> 00:30:48,654
...$ 1 200 less than the same week...

528
00:30:49,358 --> 00:30:50,791
...last year.

529
00:30:50,992 --> 00:30:52,482
That could be a fluke, right?

530
00:30:53,495 --> 00:30:54,484
Or not.

531
00:30:55,664 --> 00:30:58,497
Listen, their store is new.
It's a novelty.

532
00:30:58,767 --> 00:31:01,930
It'll all shake out. Meanwhile,
I'm putting up more twinkle lights.

533
00:31:02,471 --> 00:31:03,995
That's a fine idea.

534
00:31:04,272 --> 00:31:06,263
What if we have to fold?

535
00:31:06,441 --> 00:31:08,807
I'm never going to find
another part-time job.

536
00:31:09,010 --> 00:31:12,446
Then I won't be able to pay
my rent, and I'll have to move.

537
00:31:12,614 --> 00:31:13,979
To Brooklyn.

538
00:31:14,182 --> 00:31:17,117
The joy of rent control.
Six rooms...

539
00:31:17,319 --> 00:31:18,786
...$450 a month.

540
00:31:19,020 --> 00:31:21,113
We know. You've told us
a million times.

541
00:31:21,289 --> 00:31:24,781
I can't believe you're bringing
this up at a time like this.

542
00:31:24,960 --> 00:31:28,361
It's like those people who brag
because they're tall.

543
00:31:28,630 --> 00:31:30,461
Guys, we are not going to fold.

544
00:31:33,568 --> 00:31:35,058
This place is a tomb.

545
00:31:35,270 --> 00:31:37,636
I'm going to the nut shop,
where's it's fun.

546
00:31:50,719 --> 00:31:51,549
Miranda!

547
00:31:55,323 --> 00:31:58,190
kathleen, are you surviving?

548
00:31:58,493 --> 00:32:02,156
We're excited about your new book.
When should we schedule a signing?

549
00:32:02,664 --> 00:32:04,154
It's being published in January.

550
00:32:05,100 --> 00:32:06,658
Will you be in business in January?

551
00:32:06,902 --> 00:32:08,096
I'm so worried.

552
00:32:08,336 --> 00:32:09,633
We're doing great.

553
00:32:09,838 --> 00:32:11,032
Aren't we?

554
00:32:11,239 --> 00:32:13,104
No difference whatsoever!

555
00:32:13,341 --> 00:32:14,399
Great.

556
00:32:14,676 --> 00:32:15,836
Thank God.

557
00:32:16,511 --> 00:32:18,172
You can count on me for anything.

558
00:32:18,747 --> 00:32:20,681
Support. Rallies. Picket lines.

559
00:32:20,849 --> 00:32:22,942
We can get the Times
to write something.

560
00:32:23,852 --> 00:32:25,376
Or that nut from the Observer.

561
00:32:27,355 --> 00:32:28,686
What nut in the Observer ?

562
00:32:28,890 --> 00:32:30,255
Frank something-or-other.

563
00:32:30,525 --> 00:32:32,516
The one who's so in love
with his typewriter.

564
00:32:32,761 --> 00:32:35,229
This is just the sort of thing
that would outrage him.

565
00:32:37,866 --> 00:32:39,629
A nut? She called me a nut?

566
00:32:40,135 --> 00:32:42,797
That's not the point.
She thinks my store is in trouble.

567
00:32:43,038 --> 00:32:45,598
Why would she say that?
There's enough business for us all.

568
00:32:45,807 --> 00:32:47,365
Yes, there is. No question.

569
00:32:47,576 --> 00:32:48,600
We are fine.

570
00:32:48,810 --> 00:32:50,801
You're more than fine.
You're absolutely fine.

571
00:32:51,046 --> 00:32:52,411
We are fine.

572
00:32:52,647 --> 00:32:54,046
How are you?

573
00:32:54,249 --> 00:32:55,307
Fine.

574
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,084
Come in. Vince will be
so happy to see you.

575
00:32:58,386 --> 00:33:01,822
Congratulations. Guess who I
saw on the subway today?

576
00:33:02,057 --> 00:33:03,183
William Spungeon.

577
00:33:03,391 --> 00:33:04,653
I don't know him.

578
00:33:06,962 --> 00:33:09,021
This is amazing.
He said:

579
00:33:09,331 --> 00:33:11,458
"You should go to a retreat.

580
00:33:11,666 --> 00:33:14,294
You really should go to a retreat."

581
00:33:18,173 --> 00:33:20,232
Honey, will you get me
another drink? I'm out.

582
00:33:20,408 --> 00:33:22,000
"Because it's a
really great place...

583
00:33:22,744 --> 00:33:25,076
...to calm down."

584
00:33:25,313 --> 00:33:27,178
He said that to me.
Isn't that hilarious?

585
00:33:32,354 --> 00:33:33,912
Champagne, please.

586
00:33:34,656 --> 00:33:38,251
Stoli on the rocks.
But a fresh glass, please.

587
00:33:38,693 --> 00:33:40,183
White wine, please.

588
00:33:40,495 --> 00:33:41,826
Here you go.

589
00:33:51,973 --> 00:33:53,304
Remember me from the bookstore?

590
00:33:53,508 --> 00:33:55,703
Of course I remember you.

591
00:33:56,244 --> 00:33:57,711
How's your aunt?

592
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,777
She's great. Thanks.

593
00:33:59,981 --> 00:34:01,471
I'd better go deliver this.

594
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:04,344
I have a very thirsty date.
She's part camel.

595
00:34:04,553 --> 00:34:06,544
Joe, right? Joe, isn't it?

596
00:34:07,455 --> 00:34:08,717
And you are kathleen.

597
00:34:14,496 --> 00:34:15,622
kathleen kelly.

598
00:34:15,797 --> 00:34:17,321
Two white wine, please.

599
00:34:22,470 --> 00:34:26,463
I cannot believe that you were
speaking to Joe Fox.

600
00:34:26,808 --> 00:34:28,400
Joe Fox?

601
00:34:29,477 --> 00:34:30,136
As in--

602
00:34:30,312 --> 00:34:33,406
As in, he's going to
take over everything.

603
00:34:41,523 --> 00:34:43,650
Fox? Your last name is Fox.

604
00:34:44,826 --> 00:34:46,418
F-O-X.

605
00:34:47,696 --> 00:34:48,754
God...

606
00:34:48,964 --> 00:34:50,226
...l didn't realize--

607
00:34:50,432 --> 00:34:52,195
I didn't know--

608
00:34:52,834 --> 00:34:55,769
Who you were with?
I didn't know who you were with.

609
00:34:55,937 --> 00:34:57,495
Excuse me?

610
00:34:58,173 --> 00:35:00,107
It's from The Godfather.

611
00:35:00,442 --> 00:35:02,103
Sorry, it's from The Godfather.

612
00:35:02,344 --> 00:35:03,606
It's when...

613
00:35:03,845 --> 00:35:05,745
...the movie producer realizes
that Tom Hagen...

614
00:35:05,947 --> 00:35:08,507
...is an emissary of Vito Corleone.

615
00:35:08,717 --> 00:35:10,685
Just before the horse's head
ends up in the bed...

616
00:35:10,885 --> 00:35:13,445
...with all the bloody sheets.
Wakes up and it's--

617
00:35:17,792 --> 00:35:18,884
Never mind.

618
00:35:19,127 --> 00:35:21,220
You were spying on me, weren't you?

619
00:35:21,696 --> 00:35:23,186
You probably rented those children.

620
00:35:23,365 --> 00:35:24,389
Why would I spy on you?

621
00:35:24,633 --> 00:35:27,124
Because I am your competition,
which you know perfectly well...

622
00:35:27,369 --> 00:35:30,964
...or you wouldn't have put up the sign:
"Just around the corner."

623
00:35:31,740 --> 00:35:34,675
The entrance to our store
is around the corner.

624
00:35:34,876 --> 00:35:36,207
There's no other way to say it.

625
00:35:36,411 --> 00:35:39,539
It's not the name of our store.
It's where it is.

626
00:35:39,714 --> 00:35:40,976
And you do not own...

627
00:35:41,216 --> 00:35:43,377
...the phrase "around the corner."

628
00:35:46,388 --> 00:35:47,650
What is that?

629
00:35:48,056 --> 00:35:49,045
What are you doing?

630
00:35:49,658 --> 00:35:51,319
What is that? What are you doing?

631
00:35:51,660 --> 00:35:54,754
You're taking all the caviar?
That caviar is a garnish.

632
00:36:01,002 --> 00:36:01,832
Look...

633
00:36:02,070 --> 00:36:04,163
...the reason I came into
your store is because...

634
00:36:04,406 --> 00:36:06,499
...l was spending the day with
Annabel and Matt.

635
00:36:06,708 --> 00:36:08,039
I was buying them presents.

636
00:36:08,243 --> 00:36:10,040
I'm the type of guy
who buys his way...

637
00:36:10,245 --> 00:36:12,338
...into the hearts of children
who are relatives.

638
00:36:12,580 --> 00:36:16,175
There was only one place to find
a children's book in the neighborhood.

639
00:36:16,418 --> 00:36:17,612
That will not always be the case.

640
00:36:17,852 --> 00:36:19,581
And it was yours.
And it is...

641
00:36:19,921 --> 00:36:21,684
...a charming little bookstore.

642
00:36:21,923 --> 00:36:25,620
You probably sell, what,
$350,000 worth of books in a year?

643
00:36:25,860 --> 00:36:27,020
How did you know that?

644
00:36:27,262 --> 00:36:28,524
I'm in the book business.

645
00:36:29,531 --> 00:36:31,123
I am in the book business.

646
00:36:33,101 --> 00:36:34,090
I see.

647
00:36:34,803 --> 00:36:36,634
And we are the Price Club.

648
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,329
Only instead of a ten-gallon vat
of olive oil for $3.99...

649
00:36:40,542 --> 00:36:44,342
...that won't even fit under your
kitchen cabinet, we sell cheap books.

650
00:36:44,546 --> 00:36:46,946
Me, a spy? Absolutely.

651
00:36:47,115 --> 00:36:48,946
I have in my possession...

652
00:36:49,217 --> 00:36:51,617
...the super-duper, secret printout
of the sales figures...

653
00:36:51,820 --> 00:36:54,812
...of a bookstore so inconsequential,
yet full of its own virtue...

654
00:36:55,056 --> 00:36:56,785
...that I was compelled
to rush over...

655
00:36:56,958 --> 00:36:58,823
...for fear that it will
put me out of business.

656
00:37:01,830 --> 00:37:03,320
What? What?

657
00:37:03,898 --> 00:37:05,559
How you doing? Frank Navasky.

658
00:37:06,835 --> 00:37:07,699
Joe Fox.

659
00:37:11,740 --> 00:37:14,004
The inventor of the superstore,
of course.

660
00:37:14,242 --> 00:37:16,142
The enemy of the mid-list novel.

661
00:37:16,344 --> 00:37:17,675
The destroyer of City Books.

662
00:37:17,912 --> 00:37:19,743
Tell me something.
How do you sleep at night?

663
00:37:20,749 --> 00:37:21,909
I use a wonderful...

664
00:37:22,150 --> 00:37:23,742
...over-the-counter drug.

665
00:37:23,985 --> 00:37:24,917
"Ultra-dorm."

666
00:37:25,487 --> 00:37:27,148
Don't take the whole thing.
Just half.

667
00:37:27,355 --> 00:37:29,414
You'll wake up without
even the tiniest hangover.

668
00:37:30,158 --> 00:37:31,853
You're Frank Navasky, aren't you?

669
00:37:32,093 --> 00:37:34,323
Your last piece in the Observer...

670
00:37:34,529 --> 00:37:37,089
...about Anthony Powell was brilliant.

671
00:37:38,266 --> 00:37:39,426
Brilliant. Yes.

672
00:37:40,335 --> 00:37:41,859
I'm Patricia Eden.

673
00:37:42,103 --> 00:37:43,661
Eden Books.

674
00:37:43,872 --> 00:37:47,035
This man is the greatest
living expert...

675
00:37:47,275 --> 00:37:48,765
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

676
00:37:49,010 --> 00:37:49,942
You really liked--

677
00:37:50,178 --> 00:37:52,043
This is kathleen kelly.

678
00:37:52,280 --> 00:37:55,681
My piece? I'm sorry. I just--
You know? I'm flattered.

679
00:37:55,884 --> 00:37:58,182
You write these things.
You think somebody'll mention them.

680
00:37:58,386 --> 00:38:00,513
The phone doesn't ring for a week
and you think:

681
00:38:00,855 --> 00:38:03,380
"I'm a fraud.
I'm a failure or something."

682
00:38:03,591 --> 00:38:04,853
You know what fascinated me...

683
00:38:05,059 --> 00:38:06,526
...about Julius and Ethel Rosenberg?

684
00:38:06,728 --> 00:38:09,026
Is how old they looked
when they were really just...

685
00:38:09,230 --> 00:38:10,060
...our age.

686
00:38:11,699 --> 00:38:12,631
You know?

687
00:38:13,468 --> 00:38:15,129
I'm so happy to have
finally met you.

688
00:38:16,771 --> 00:38:19,365
We'll talk. Have you ever
thought about doing a book?

689
00:38:19,574 --> 00:38:21,542
It's crossed my mind,
something relevant for today...

690
00:38:21,743 --> 00:38:24,712
...like the Luddite movement in
1 9th century England. We should talk.

691
00:38:24,913 --> 00:38:25,811
Call me.

692
00:38:26,047 --> 00:38:28,709
Have you ever had a caviar garnish?

693
00:38:34,622 --> 00:38:37,785
I had no idea Frank Navasky...

694
00:38:37,992 --> 00:38:40,517
...was going to be so down-to-earth.

695
00:38:41,229 --> 00:38:42,890
You know, you read his stuff...

696
00:38:43,131 --> 00:38:45,827
...you think he's going to be
so obscure and abstruse.

697
00:38:46,034 --> 00:38:48,969
He's always talking
about Heidegger...

698
00:38:49,170 --> 00:38:50,535
...and Foucault.

699
00:38:50,738 --> 00:38:54,003
And I have no idea what
any of it's about really.

700
00:38:59,314 --> 00:39:00,212
Where you going?

701
00:39:00,815 --> 00:39:02,908
I'm not tired. I'm not.

702
00:39:18,366 --> 00:39:22,166
Do you ever feel you've become
the worst version of yourself?

703
00:39:26,374 --> 00:39:28,035
That a Pandora's box...

704
00:39:28,243 --> 00:39:32,680
...of all the secret, hateful parts,
your arrogance, your spite...

705
00:39:32,881 --> 00:39:34,280
...your condescension...

706
00:39:34,515 --> 00:39:36,039
...has sprung open?

707
00:39:36,251 --> 00:39:39,049
Someone provokes you,
and instead ofjust smiling...

708
00:39:39,287 --> 00:39:42,188
...and moving on, you zing them?

709
00:39:42,390 --> 00:39:44,915
"Hello, it's Mr. Nasty. "

710
00:39:45,760 --> 00:39:48,593
I'm sure you have no idea
what I'm talking about.

711
00:39:49,631 --> 00:39:52,862
No, I know what you mean,
and I'm completelyjealous.

712
00:39:55,036 --> 00:39:57,630
What happens to me when I'm provoked
is I get tongue-tied.

713
00:39:57,872 --> 00:39:59,464
My mind goes...

714
00:39:59,974 --> 00:40:00,963
...blank.

715
00:40:04,045 --> 00:40:06,309
Then I toss and turn all night...

716
00:40:06,547 --> 00:40:08,913
...trying to figure out
what I should have said.

717
00:40:12,687 --> 00:40:14,552
What should I have said,
for example, to the...

718
00:40:14,756 --> 00:40:17,316
...bottom-dweller...

719
00:40:21,362 --> 00:40:23,830
...who recently belittled
my existence?

720
00:40:32,941 --> 00:40:34,033
Nothing.

721
00:40:35,009 --> 00:40:36,476
Nothing. Even now.

722
00:40:36,678 --> 00:40:37,770
Even now...

723
00:40:38,012 --> 00:40:38,910
...days later...

724
00:40:39,113 --> 00:40:40,512
...l can't figure it out.

725
00:40:41,049 --> 00:40:44,917
Wouldn't it be wonderful if I could
pass all my zingers to you?

726
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,919
Then I'd never behave badly and
you could behave badly all the time.

727
00:40:49,123 --> 00:40:50,283
And we'd both be happy.

728
00:40:50,491 --> 00:40:52,049
On the other hand,
I must warn you...

729
00:40:52,260 --> 00:40:55,559
...that when you finally say
the thing you mean to say...

730
00:40:55,763 --> 00:40:59,893
...the moment you mean to say it,
remorse inevitably follows.

731
00:41:05,139 --> 00:41:07,573
Do you think we should meet?

732
00:41:17,986 --> 00:41:19,385
Meet?

733
00:41:19,954 --> 00:41:21,717
Oh, my God.

734
00:42:23,885 --> 00:42:25,819
$72.27.

735
00:42:27,789 --> 00:42:30,121
This is a cash-only line.

736
00:42:32,493 --> 00:42:33,517
Cash only.

737
00:42:34,128 --> 00:42:35,561
Oh, my God.

738
00:42:36,464 --> 00:42:38,056
I just have a credit card.

739
00:42:38,299 --> 00:42:39,459
I'm sorry. Is that okay?

740
00:42:39,667 --> 00:42:41,225
No, it's not okay.

741
00:42:41,636 --> 00:42:42,796
There's a sign.

742
00:42:44,005 --> 00:42:45,870
I'm sorry. I'm very sorry.

743
00:42:46,074 --> 00:42:49,771
I never do this. But I ask you to make
an exception in this one case.

744
00:42:49,977 --> 00:42:51,638
You have no cash?

745
00:42:51,846 --> 00:42:52,744
She has no cash.

746
00:42:52,980 --> 00:42:53,844
No, she has no cash.

747
00:42:54,048 --> 00:42:55,413
Get on another line, lady.

748
00:42:55,616 --> 00:42:57,049
I have a dollar. That's all I have.

749
00:42:57,251 --> 00:42:59,014
I have a dollar. One dollar.

750
00:42:59,220 --> 00:43:01,211
Is there anything you can do?

751
00:43:02,890 --> 00:43:03,857
Do you need some money?

752
00:43:04,058 --> 00:43:05,889
No, I do not need any money.

753
00:43:06,094 --> 00:43:06,924
Thank you very much.

754
00:43:07,161 --> 00:43:09,026
Get in another line.

755
00:43:09,664 --> 00:43:10,961
Rose.

756
00:43:11,165 --> 00:43:13,258
That is a great name. Rose.

757
00:43:13,568 --> 00:43:14,500
This is kathleen.

758
00:43:14,702 --> 00:43:15,532
I'm Joe. And--

759
00:43:15,736 --> 00:43:16,794
And I'm Henry.

760
00:43:17,004 --> 00:43:18,938
Henry, how are you? Happy holidays.

761
00:43:19,173 --> 00:43:21,368
This is a credit card machine.

762
00:43:22,076 --> 00:43:23,065
Happy Thanksgiving.

763
00:43:24,579 --> 00:43:26,513
It's your turn to say
"Happy Thanksgiving" back.

764
00:43:27,415 --> 00:43:29,178
Happy Thanksgiving back.

765
00:43:29,550 --> 00:43:30,574
knock, knock.

766
00:43:31,552 --> 00:43:32,519
Who's there?

767
00:43:33,087 --> 00:43:33,917
Orange.

768
00:43:34,689 --> 00:43:35,747
Orange who?

769
00:43:35,957 --> 00:43:37,424
Orange you going to give us a break...

770
00:43:37,625 --> 00:43:41,083
...by zipping this credit card
through the credit card machine?

771
00:43:41,863 --> 00:43:43,194
Come on. You can do it.

772
00:43:43,397 --> 00:43:44,193
Zip, zip.

773
00:43:45,066 --> 00:43:46,192
There you go.

774
00:43:47,268 --> 00:43:48,098
Rose?

775
00:43:50,138 --> 00:43:52,197
That is a great name.

776
00:43:52,940 --> 00:43:53,929
So you're fine.

777
00:43:55,076 --> 00:43:55,906
Fine.

778
00:43:56,110 --> 00:43:58,908
Happy Thanksgiving.
Henry, happy Thanksgiving.

779
00:43:59,947 --> 00:44:01,608
I'm so sorry.
Really, I apologize.

780
00:44:01,816 --> 00:44:04,284
-From the bottom of my heart.
-So sign already!

781
00:44:04,952 --> 00:44:06,112
I'd like to get home.

782
00:44:06,320 --> 00:44:08,880
You have my pen.

783
00:44:11,859 --> 00:44:15,192
The sun'll come out tomorrow

784
00:44:15,596 --> 00:44:17,564
Bet your bottom dollar that

785
00:44:17,765 --> 00:44:20,598
Tomorrow there'll be sun

786
00:44:22,036 --> 00:44:25,028
Just thinking about tomorrow

787
00:44:25,940 --> 00:44:28,272
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow

788
00:44:29,277 --> 00:44:30,767
Till there's none

789
00:44:31,646 --> 00:44:34,274
When I'm stuck with a day that's gray

790
00:44:34,482 --> 00:44:35,813
And lonely

791
00:44:36,484 --> 00:44:39,282
Ijust stick out my chin and grin

792
00:44:39,487 --> 00:44:41,182
And say:

793
00:44:42,623 --> 00:44:45,148
Oh, the sun'll come out tomorrow

794
00:44:45,359 --> 00:44:48,294
So you got to hang on till tomorrow

795
00:44:49,397 --> 00:44:51,194
Come what may

796
00:44:52,466 --> 00:44:54,866
Tomorrow, tomorrow

797
00:44:55,069 --> 00:44:57,469
I love you, tomorrow

798
00:44:57,672 --> 00:45:00,300
You're always a day

799
00:45:01,642 --> 00:45:02,973
Away

800
00:45:11,452 --> 00:45:12,248
Wonderful.

801
00:45:12,486 --> 00:45:13,384
Thank you.

802
00:45:13,588 --> 00:45:15,818
The violins

803
00:45:16,057 --> 00:45:19,254
Sing withjoyful ring

804
00:45:20,094 --> 00:45:22,028
The violins

805
00:45:22,230 --> 00:45:25,666
Sing withjoyful ring

806
00:45:27,501 --> 00:45:30,993
The clarinet, the clarinet

807
00:45:31,339 --> 00:45:34,069
Goes doodly, doodly, doodly, doodly det

808
00:45:41,682 --> 00:45:45,550
The horn, the horn

809
00:45:45,753 --> 00:45:47,482
It sounds....

810
00:45:47,688 --> 00:45:50,350
The horn sounds so forlorn

811
00:45:56,063 --> 00:45:57,087
I got it.

812
00:46:53,721 --> 00:46:56,656
"It's coming on Christmas.
They're cutting down trees. "

813
00:46:56,857 --> 00:46:59,121
Do you know that Joni Mitchell song?

814
00:46:59,527 --> 00:47:02,792
"I wish I had a river
I could skate away on. "

815
00:47:02,997 --> 00:47:06,330
Such a sad song. And not
really about Christmas at all.

816
00:47:07,101 --> 00:47:08,762
I was thinking about it tonight...

817
00:47:08,969 --> 00:47:10,630
...as I was
decorating my Christmas tree.

818
00:47:10,838 --> 00:47:13,432
Unwrapping funky ornaments
made of Popsicle sticks...

819
00:47:13,641 --> 00:47:16,872
...and missing my mother so much
I almost couldn't breathe.

820
00:47:17,978 --> 00:47:20,242
I always miss my mother at Christmas.

821
00:47:20,448 --> 00:47:22,177
But somehow it is worse this year...

822
00:47:22,383 --> 00:47:24,613
...since I need some advice from her.

823
00:47:24,852 --> 00:47:26,319
I need her to make me cocoa.

824
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,852
And tell me that everything
going badly in my life...

825
00:47:29,056 --> 00:47:30,614
...will sort itself out.

826
00:47:33,461 --> 00:47:36,658
What kind of advice do you need?
Can I help?

827
00:47:43,137 --> 00:47:44,798
Can you help?

828
00:47:46,741 --> 00:47:48,572
I wish you could help.

829
00:47:50,544 --> 00:47:51,374
I wish....

830
00:47:53,247 --> 00:47:55,977
I had a gut feeling
you would be online now.

831
00:47:58,986 --> 00:48:00,248
I can give you advice.

832
00:48:00,488 --> 00:48:02,319
I'm great at advice.

833
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:14,827
If only you could help.

834
00:48:19,240 --> 00:48:20,969
Is it about love?

835
00:48:21,175 --> 00:48:22,608
Please say no.

836
00:48:23,544 --> 00:48:25,671
No. How cute is that?

837
00:48:25,880 --> 00:48:28,075
My business is in trouble.

838
00:48:30,885 --> 00:48:32,113
Well.

839
00:48:35,623 --> 00:48:37,887
I'm a brilliant businessman.

840
00:48:38,092 --> 00:48:40,117
It's what I do best.

841
00:48:40,361 --> 00:48:41,953
What's your business?

842
00:48:44,532 --> 00:48:46,693
No specifics. Remember?

843
00:48:51,939 --> 00:48:53,133
Well.

844
00:48:53,374 --> 00:48:55,808
Minus specifics, it's hard to help...

845
00:48:56,043 --> 00:48:57,977
...except to say:

846
00:48:58,212 --> 00:48:59,645
"Go to the mattresses."

847
00:49:00,781 --> 00:49:03,215
"Except to say, 'Go to the mattre--' "

848
00:49:04,652 --> 00:49:05,619
What?

849
00:49:07,655 --> 00:49:08,553
What does that mean?

850
00:49:09,423 --> 00:49:13,086
It's from The Godfather.
It means you have to go to war.

851
00:49:15,796 --> 00:49:18,890
What is it with men
and The Godfather ?

852
00:49:19,300 --> 00:49:20,289
Hello?

853
00:49:22,670 --> 00:49:24,638
Oh, come on. Hello?

854
00:49:25,339 --> 00:49:26,601
Well....

855
00:49:27,141 --> 00:49:29,006
Well, what can l....

856
00:49:29,243 --> 00:49:30,505
Michael--

857
00:49:31,078 --> 00:49:31,874
The Godfather...

858
00:49:32,079 --> 00:49:34,070
..is the l-Ching.

859
00:49:35,149 --> 00:49:37,310
The Godfather is the sum of all wisdom.

860
00:49:38,953 --> 00:49:41,513
The Godfather is the answer
to any question.

861
00:49:41,755 --> 00:49:43,882
What should I pack
for my summer vacation?

862
00:49:44,091 --> 00:49:46,082
"Leave the gun. Take the cannoli. "

863
00:49:47,127 --> 00:49:49,288
What day of the week is it?

864
00:49:50,130 --> 00:49:53,657
"Monday, Tuesday, Thursday, Wednesday."

865
00:49:54,468 --> 00:49:56,060
The answer to your question...

866
00:49:56,270 --> 00:49:59,171
...is "Go to the mattresses. "

867
00:50:00,007 --> 00:50:02,737
You're at war.
"It's not personal, it's business. "

868
00:50:02,943 --> 00:50:06,435
It's not personal. It's business.

869
00:50:06,847 --> 00:50:07,745
Recite that to yourself...

870
00:50:07,948 --> 00:50:11,782
...every time you feel
you're losing your nerve.

871
00:50:14,455 --> 00:50:15,945
I know you worry about being brave.

872
00:50:16,156 --> 00:50:17,282
Don't.

873
00:50:18,292 --> 00:50:20,192
This is your chance.

874
00:50:20,628 --> 00:50:22,118
Fight.

875
00:50:22,730 --> 00:50:24,061
Fight to the death!

876
00:50:30,838 --> 00:50:33,363
It's not personal.
It's business. Just fight!

877
00:50:33,574 --> 00:50:34,404
Fight, fight, fight!

878
00:50:44,084 --> 00:50:45,483
I've been thinking.

879
00:50:47,221 --> 00:50:48,210
What?

880
00:50:48,756 --> 00:50:50,690
I've decided to go to the mattresses.

881
00:50:50,891 --> 00:50:53,416
Do you think it would be
a gigantic conflict of interest...

882
00:50:53,661 --> 00:50:55,652
...if you wrote something
about the store?

883
00:50:56,096 --> 00:50:56,926
Yes.

884
00:50:57,164 --> 00:50:58,062
Yes?

885
00:50:58,265 --> 00:50:59,254
No.

886
00:51:00,501 --> 00:51:01,991
So you'll do it?

887
00:51:05,039 --> 00:51:07,166
Do you know what it is
to go to the mattresses?

888
00:51:07,374 --> 00:51:09,035
From The Godfather.

889
00:51:12,780 --> 00:51:14,805
Good morning, Shop Around The Corner.

890
00:51:15,015 --> 00:51:16,607
George speaking, may I help you?

891
00:51:18,218 --> 00:51:20,118
The Channel Two truck just pulled up.

892
00:51:20,354 --> 00:51:21,252
In a second.

893
00:51:21,455 --> 00:51:23,252
Everyone's read the article.

894
00:51:23,457 --> 00:51:26,688
"And so, you do not have to look
to any of the usual places...

895
00:51:26,894 --> 00:51:28,953
...where good and evil face off...

896
00:51:29,196 --> 00:51:31,824
...the places Herodotus called
'the happy land...

897
00:51:32,032 --> 00:51:33,363
...of absolutes.'

898
00:51:33,734 --> 00:51:37,033
We have the perfect example
here on the West Side...

899
00:51:37,237 --> 00:51:40,263
...where the cold cash cow Fox Books...

900
00:51:40,474 --> 00:51:42,533
...threatens survival of a temple...

901
00:51:42,743 --> 00:51:45,735
...to one of the twentieth century's
most profound truths:

902
00:51:45,946 --> 00:51:48,540
You are what you read."

903
00:51:48,882 --> 00:51:50,474
I believe that.

904
00:51:50,951 --> 00:51:52,851
"Save The Shop Around The Corner...

905
00:51:53,053 --> 00:51:55,647
...and you will save your soul."

906
00:51:57,391 --> 00:51:59,882
Frank, that's charming.

907
00:52:00,461 --> 00:52:01,826
You think it's a little over the top?

908
00:52:02,062 --> 00:52:05,793
That was The Village Voice.
I told them to come over whenever.

909
00:52:06,000 --> 00:52:07,058
Okay. All right.

910
00:52:07,668 --> 00:52:10,193
"Float like a butterfly.
Sting like a bee."

911
00:52:10,404 --> 00:52:11,496
One, two, three, four!

912
00:52:11,739 --> 00:52:13,730
We don't want your superstore!

913
00:52:13,941 --> 00:52:15,966
Five, six, seven, eight!

914
00:52:16,176 --> 00:52:18,337
Go away and close the gate!

915
00:52:18,579 --> 00:52:20,672
One, two, three, four!

916
00:52:20,914 --> 00:52:23,712
"We don't want this superstore."

917
00:52:23,917 --> 00:52:25,475
-Is that what they're saying?
-Catchy, yeah.

918
00:52:25,686 --> 00:52:26,914
Well, who wrote that?

919
00:52:27,121 --> 00:52:28,110
Annoying.

920
00:52:28,822 --> 00:52:30,551
Pissing me off, actually.

921
00:52:30,758 --> 00:52:31,850
Do you want the West Side...

922
00:52:32,092 --> 00:52:35,255
...to become one big gigantic
strip mall?

923
00:52:37,097 --> 00:52:40,430
Do you want to get off the subway
at 72nd and Broadway...

924
00:52:40,634 --> 00:52:43,125
...and not even know
you're in New York City?

925
00:52:44,004 --> 00:52:46,871
Can we save The Shop Around The Corner?

926
00:52:48,509 --> 00:52:49,339
We're here...

927
00:52:49,543 --> 00:52:50,942
...in front of
The Shop Around The Corner...

928
00:52:51,145 --> 00:52:53,170
...the famous West Side
children's bookstore...

929
00:52:53,380 --> 00:52:55,905
...now on the verge
of having to close its doors...

930
00:52:56,116 --> 00:52:58,050
...because the big bad wolf,
Fox Books...

931
00:52:58,285 --> 00:53:00,480
...has opened
only a few hundred feet away...

932
00:53:00,688 --> 00:53:04,818
...wooing customers with its sharp
discounts and designer coffee.

933
00:53:06,026 --> 00:53:07,823
They have to have
discounts and lattes...

934
00:53:08,028 --> 00:53:10,189
...because most of the people
who work there have never read a book.

935
00:53:10,397 --> 00:53:13,366
She's not as nice
as she seems on television.

936
00:53:13,567 --> 00:53:14,966
You met her?

937
00:53:15,502 --> 00:53:17,197
Boy, she's a pill.

938
00:53:17,671 --> 00:53:20,071
She probably ain't as fine
as she look on TV, either?

939
00:53:20,641 --> 00:53:22,268
No, no. She's beautiful.

940
00:53:22,476 --> 00:53:23,374
But...

941
00:53:23,577 --> 00:53:25,169
...she's a pill.

942
00:53:25,512 --> 00:53:26,444
You don't feel bad...

943
00:53:26,647 --> 00:53:28,114
...about basically sending her ass...

944
00:53:28,315 --> 00:53:30,112
...back to the projects
with food stamps?

945
00:53:30,317 --> 00:53:31,909
Broke, single, white lady.

946
00:53:32,152 --> 00:53:33,278
It's not personal.

947
00:53:33,487 --> 00:53:34,385
It's business.

948
00:53:35,823 --> 00:53:37,950
Here's a good-looking guy.

949
00:53:38,158 --> 00:53:40,820
I sell cheap books.
I do. So sue me.

950
00:53:41,328 --> 00:53:42,124
And that, in a nutshell...

951
00:53:42,329 --> 00:53:43,990
...is the Fox Books philosophy.

952
00:53:44,565 --> 00:53:45,930
That's what you said?

953
00:53:46,166 --> 00:53:47,633
Discount them and sell them.

954
00:53:47,835 --> 00:53:49,359
Yeah, that's not all I said!

955
00:53:49,570 --> 00:53:52,300
I can't believe those bastards.
I said we were great!

956
00:53:52,506 --> 00:53:54,940
I said you could read for hours
and no one will bother you.

957
00:53:55,175 --> 00:53:56,472
I said we had 1 50,000 titles.

958
00:53:56,677 --> 00:53:58,304
I showed them
the New York City section.

959
00:53:58,512 --> 00:54:00,742
I said we were a goddamn piazza.

960
00:54:00,948 --> 00:54:03,314
A place in the city where people
could mingle and mix.

961
00:54:03,517 --> 00:54:04,449
Piazza?

962
00:54:04,685 --> 00:54:06,312
I was eloquent!

963
00:54:06,520 --> 00:54:07,748
Shit!

964
00:54:09,123 --> 00:54:10,420
It's inevitable, I guess.

965
00:54:10,624 --> 00:54:12,615
People want to
turn her into Joan of Arc.

966
00:54:12,860 --> 00:54:14,623
And you into Attila the Hun.

967
00:54:14,862 --> 00:54:16,853
Not me personally,
but the company, yeah.

968
00:54:18,866 --> 00:54:20,458
I have met Joe Fox.

969
00:54:21,135 --> 00:54:24,696
And I've heard him compare
his store to a Price Club...

970
00:54:24,905 --> 00:54:27,373
...and the books in it
to cans of olive oil.

971
00:54:31,411 --> 00:54:33,242
The bookstore, tell us about it.

972
00:54:35,949 --> 00:54:37,246
The Shop Around The Corner...

973
00:54:37,451 --> 00:54:41,114
...has a kind of
Jeffersonian purity to it...

974
00:54:41,321 --> 00:54:45,985
...that the city needs in order
to maintain historical integrity.

975
00:54:46,226 --> 00:54:47,386
Jeffersonian purity.

976
00:54:47,594 --> 00:54:49,687
That was nice. Thank you.
That sounded good.

977
00:54:49,897 --> 00:54:50,886
Are you taping this?

978
00:54:51,098 --> 00:54:51,928
Yeah, I'm taping this.

979
00:54:52,800 --> 00:54:54,768
Technologically speaking,
the world's out of hand.

980
00:54:54,968 --> 00:54:56,560
I mean, take the VCR.

981
00:54:56,937 --> 00:55:01,169
The whole idea behind the VCR
is that it makes it possible...

982
00:55:01,408 --> 00:55:03,603
...for you to tape what's on
television...

983
00:55:03,811 --> 00:55:04,937
...when you leave the house.

984
00:55:05,145 --> 00:55:07,636
Of course, the whole idea
behind leaving the house...

985
00:55:07,848 --> 00:55:09,338
...is so you can miss...

986
00:55:09,583 --> 00:55:11,414
...what's on television.

987
00:55:11,618 --> 00:55:13,483
-I've heard you say that before.
-She hasn't.

988
00:55:13,687 --> 00:55:14,984
Absolutely.

989
00:55:15,189 --> 00:55:16,588
Right.

990
00:55:16,990 --> 00:55:18,389
She gets it.

991
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:20,583
Radio.
There's a medium I can get behind.

992
00:55:21,962 --> 00:55:23,623
Are you going to
start collecting radios--

993
00:55:23,831 --> 00:55:25,025
We're on television.

994
00:55:25,766 --> 00:55:27,097
You're good at it.

995
00:55:30,604 --> 00:55:32,435
She's coming on to you.

996
00:55:32,639 --> 00:55:34,607
No. They do this on television.

997
00:55:34,808 --> 00:55:36,002
The Shop Around The Corner...

998
00:55:36,210 --> 00:55:38,804
...it's a true New York treasure.

999
00:55:39,012 --> 00:55:40,206
As are you.

1000
00:55:43,884 --> 00:55:46,045
Honestly, I'd love to have you back.

1001
00:55:46,286 --> 00:55:47,810
Is she sweating?

1002
00:55:48,021 --> 00:55:49,682
She's touching herself.
And she's sweating.

1003
00:55:50,891 --> 00:55:51,880
Anytime.

1004
00:55:54,094 --> 00:55:55,391
Okay, we can turn it off.

1005
00:55:55,629 --> 00:55:56,891
Oh, my God.

1006
00:55:57,130 --> 00:56:00,293
Ijust want to say that
yours is the only show I do watch.

1007
00:56:00,868 --> 00:56:01,892
Oh, my God.

1008
00:56:02,135 --> 00:56:04,103
No! I was being polite.

1009
00:56:04,304 --> 00:56:05,737
Thank you, Frank Navasky.

1010
00:56:06,506 --> 00:56:08,201
Thank you're...? I'm sorry.

1011
00:56:08,408 --> 00:56:09,739
Thank you're?

1012
00:56:09,977 --> 00:56:11,467
Thank you're, ladies and gentlemen.

1013
00:56:12,846 --> 00:56:15,076
I slobbered all over her, didn't l?

1014
00:56:16,183 --> 00:56:19,584
But I think that
there's something there.

1015
00:56:31,331 --> 00:56:35,324
So first, I got to go get
some eucalyptus candles...

1016
00:56:35,535 --> 00:56:36,399
...because it makes...

1017
00:56:36,603 --> 00:56:39,071
...my apartment smell mossy.

1018
00:56:39,573 --> 00:56:40,631
Then I'm going to the market.

1019
00:56:40,841 --> 00:56:42,706
And I can't decide whether to get...

1020
00:56:42,910 --> 00:56:45,902
...sausage for the meat sauce,
or chopped meat.

1021
00:56:46,380 --> 00:56:47,779
Spare us.

1022
00:56:48,081 --> 00:56:49,343
You know what? Clam sauce.

1023
00:56:49,950 --> 00:56:51,417
Because this is a big date.

1024
00:56:56,857 --> 00:56:57,789
Don't tell me.

1025
00:56:58,025 --> 00:56:59,356
Not the slightest difference?

1026
00:57:01,628 --> 00:57:02,856
How can that be?

1027
00:57:03,063 --> 00:57:06,521
All this publicity
and not one bit of difference?

1028
00:57:08,201 --> 00:57:10,533
Birdie, what am I going to do?

1029
00:57:11,138 --> 00:57:12,332
What would Mom have done?

1030
00:57:14,207 --> 00:57:16,641
Well, let's ask her.

1031
00:57:20,414 --> 00:57:23,542
Cecilia, what should we do?

1032
00:57:28,822 --> 00:57:29,880
She has no idea.

1033
00:57:30,090 --> 00:57:33,548
But she thinks
the window display is lovely.

1034
00:57:38,498 --> 00:57:40,227
Good night, dearie.

1035
00:57:55,582 --> 00:57:56,810
I need help.

1036
00:57:59,853 --> 00:58:01,616
Do you still want to meet me?

1037
00:58:04,691 --> 00:58:07,660
I would love to meet you.
Where? When?

1038
00:58:08,128 --> 00:58:09,925
So I suppose she's
carrying a copy...

1039
00:58:10,130 --> 00:58:12,121
...of a book with a flower in it?

1040
00:58:13,967 --> 00:58:15,298
Not really?

1041
00:58:15,802 --> 00:58:17,997
She could be a real dog, man.

1042
00:58:18,205 --> 00:58:20,070
I'm only staying 1 0 minutes.

1043
00:58:20,273 --> 00:58:22,571
I'll say hello, have a cup of
coffee and then split.

1044
00:58:22,776 --> 00:58:23,970
That's what I'm going to do.

1045
00:58:24,277 --> 00:58:27,246
Hope she doesn't have a squeaky voice
like the mice in Cinderella.

1046
00:58:27,447 --> 00:58:28,277
I hate that.

1047
00:58:28,482 --> 00:58:31,178
Why am I doing this?
Why am I compelled to meet her?!

1048
00:58:31,385 --> 00:58:32,682
Why?

1049
00:58:33,286 --> 00:58:34,116
Relax.

1050
00:58:34,321 --> 00:58:35,948
You're just taking it to the next level.

1051
00:58:36,156 --> 00:58:37,453
I always do that.

1052
00:58:37,657 --> 00:58:39,818
I always take
a relationship to the next level.

1053
00:58:40,027 --> 00:58:43,622
If that works out, I take it
to the next level after that.

1054
00:58:43,830 --> 00:58:47,994
Till I finally reach that level where
it becomes absolutely necessary...

1055
00:58:48,201 --> 00:58:49,190
...for me to leave.

1056
00:58:51,371 --> 00:58:53,100
I'm not going to stay that long anyway.

1057
00:58:53,306 --> 00:58:54,364
I already said that, didn't l?

1058
00:59:00,147 --> 00:59:03,412
Well, okay. Caf Lalo.
This is it.

1059
00:59:04,518 --> 00:59:07,248
Eight o'clock.
Boy, we got here fast, didn't we?

1060
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:13,218
This woman is the most adorable creature
I've ever been in contact with.

1061
00:59:13,493 --> 00:59:17,327
And if she turns out even to be
as good-looking as a mailbox...

1062
00:59:17,531 --> 00:59:21,331
...l'd be crazy not to turn my life
upside-down and marry her.

1063
00:59:22,102 --> 00:59:24,093
She could be a real dog.

1064
00:59:24,304 --> 00:59:25,430
But good luck.

1065
00:59:29,776 --> 00:59:31,869
Would you go and look for me?

1066
00:59:32,112 --> 00:59:35,138
Yes, go look through the window
and check her out. Please?

1067
00:59:35,348 --> 00:59:36,542
All right.

1068
00:59:38,885 --> 00:59:41,080
-You're pathetic, man.
-I know.

1069
00:59:43,290 --> 00:59:45,224
All right. I'll see what I see.

1070
00:59:45,959 --> 00:59:47,290
You see her?

1071
00:59:48,595 --> 00:59:49,619
Wait, yeah.

1072
00:59:49,963 --> 00:59:52,397
I see a very beautiful girl.

1073
00:59:52,866 --> 00:59:54,356
She's fine.

1074
00:59:55,302 --> 00:59:57,167
-I knew it.
-She's gorgeous.

1075
00:59:57,370 --> 00:59:58,860
I knew she would be.
I knew it.

1076
00:59:59,072 --> 01:00:00,539
But no book.

1077
01:00:03,877 --> 01:00:04,844
All right.

1078
01:00:05,045 --> 01:00:07,104
Okay, wait. Wait a minute.

1079
01:00:07,314 --> 01:00:10,511
There's a book with a flower.
So this got to be her.

1080
01:00:10,717 --> 01:00:12,207
And what does she look like?

1081
01:00:12,786 --> 01:00:14,083
Can't see her. Waiter's blocking.

1082
01:00:14,321 --> 01:00:15,583
Damn it!

1083
01:00:15,822 --> 01:00:16,880
Hold on. He's moving.

1084
01:00:20,127 --> 01:00:21,219
Can you see her?

1085
01:00:23,130 --> 01:00:23,960
Can you see her?

1086
01:00:25,899 --> 01:00:27,093
Yeah.

1087
01:00:27,300 --> 01:00:28,198
And?

1088
01:00:30,604 --> 01:00:32,265
She's very pretty.

1089
01:00:32,472 --> 01:00:33,871
She is!

1090
01:00:34,074 --> 01:00:36,474
I knew she would be!
She had to be!

1091
01:00:36,710 --> 01:00:38,610
She had to be!

1092
01:00:40,580 --> 01:00:41,672
You know what?

1093
01:00:41,882 --> 01:00:43,315
She look--

1094
01:00:44,384 --> 01:00:47,945
I mean, she almost has
the same coloring as...

1095
01:00:48,155 --> 01:00:49,622
...that kathleen kelly person.

1096
01:00:49,823 --> 01:00:51,222
kathleen kelly
of the little bookstore?

1097
01:00:51,424 --> 01:00:53,051
Why not? You said you thought
she was attractive.

1098
01:00:53,260 --> 01:00:56,559
Absolutely, yes. Why not?
Who cares about kathleen kelly?

1099
01:00:56,763 --> 01:01:00,096
Well, if you don't like
kathleen kelly...

1100
01:01:00,400 --> 01:01:02,265
...l can tell you right now...

1101
01:01:03,069 --> 01:01:04,161
...you ain't going to like this girl.

1102
01:01:05,572 --> 01:01:06,402
Why not?

1103
01:01:08,241 --> 01:01:10,141
Because it is kathleen kelly.

1104
01:01:23,256 --> 01:01:24,985
So what are you going to do?

1105
01:01:28,762 --> 01:01:30,286
Nothing.

1106
01:01:30,797 --> 01:01:32,890
You're going
to let her wait all night?

1107
01:01:33,099 --> 01:01:35,260
Yes. That's exactly
what I'm going to do.

1108
01:01:36,603 --> 01:01:39,003
Good night, kevin.
I'll see you in the morning.

1109
01:01:48,114 --> 01:01:49,581
Do you mind if I borrow this chair?

1110
01:01:49,783 --> 01:01:51,614
Yes, I mind. Sorry.

1111
01:01:51,818 --> 01:01:53,683
I'm expecting someone.

1112
01:02:07,467 --> 01:02:09,367
Would you like another tea?

1113
01:02:09,970 --> 01:02:11,631
Yes. Thank you.

1114
01:02:47,274 --> 01:02:50,175
This is a coincidence.
Would you mind if I sat down?

1115
01:02:50,377 --> 01:02:53,505
Yes, I would, actually.
I'm expecting someone.

1116
01:02:54,581 --> 01:02:55,570
Pride and Prejudice.

1117
01:02:56,583 --> 01:02:57,515
Do you mind?

1118
01:02:57,784 --> 01:02:59,251
I bet you read that book every year.

1119
01:02:59,452 --> 01:03:00,919
I bet you just love that...

1120
01:03:01,121 --> 01:03:02,782
...Mr. Darcy.

1121
01:03:03,023 --> 01:03:06,117
Your sentimental heart beats wildly
at the thought he and...

1122
01:03:06,359 --> 01:03:08,020
...you know, whatever her name is...

1123
01:03:08,228 --> 01:03:11,197
...are truly, honestly going
to end up together.

1124
01:03:14,968 --> 01:03:15,866
Can I get you something?

1125
01:03:16,069 --> 01:03:17,195
No. He's not staying.

1126
01:03:17,404 --> 01:03:18,371
Mochaccino decaf, nonfat.

1127
01:03:19,105 --> 01:03:20,265
No. You are not staying!

1128
01:03:21,408 --> 01:03:22,534
I'll stay until your friend gets here.

1129
01:03:24,911 --> 01:03:25,969
Is he late?

1130
01:03:26,446 --> 01:03:29,506
The heroine of Pride and Prejudice
is Elizabeth Bennet.

1131
01:03:29,716 --> 01:03:33,277
She is a great and complex character.
Not that you would know.

1132
01:03:33,486 --> 01:03:35,351
As a matter of fact, I've read it.

1133
01:03:35,555 --> 01:03:36,783
Good for you.

1134
01:03:37,557 --> 01:03:39,718
I think you'd discover a lot of things
if you really knew me.

1135
01:03:40,327 --> 01:03:42,022
If I really knew you,
I know what I'd find.

1136
01:03:42,228 --> 01:03:44,128
Instead of a brain, a cash register.

1137
01:03:44,331 --> 01:03:46,060
Instead of a heart, a bottom line.

1138
01:03:50,170 --> 01:03:51,000
What?

1139
01:03:51,237 --> 01:03:52,397
I just had a breakthrough.

1140
01:03:52,605 --> 01:03:53,469
What is it?

1141
01:03:53,673 --> 01:03:55,766
I have you to thank for it.
For the first time in my life...

1142
01:03:55,975 --> 01:03:58,603
...when confronted with a horrible,
insensitive person...

1143
01:03:58,812 --> 01:04:01,337
...l knew exactly what I wanted
to say, and I said it.

1144
01:04:02,082 --> 01:04:03,242
You have a gift for it.

1145
01:04:03,450 --> 01:04:05,748
That was a perfect blend
of poetry and meanness.

1146
01:04:06,186 --> 01:04:07,915
Meanness? Let me tell
you something about meanness.

1147
01:04:08,121 --> 01:04:11,522
Don't misunderstand me.
I'm trying to pay you a compliment.

1148
01:04:12,459 --> 01:04:14,723
Why are you touching that?
What are you doing?

1149
01:04:14,928 --> 01:04:17,192
Is this a red rose? No.
It's a crimson rose.

1150
01:04:17,497 --> 01:04:18,964
Something you read in a book,
no doubt.

1151
01:04:19,165 --> 01:04:20,154
It's funny to you, isn't it?

1152
01:04:20,934 --> 01:04:22,799
Everything is a joke to you.

1153
01:04:32,645 --> 01:04:34,010
Please leave.

1154
01:04:34,214 --> 01:04:36,011
Please, please leave. I beg you.

1155
01:04:43,456 --> 01:04:44,650
Thank you.

1156
01:05:06,079 --> 01:05:09,412
You know what that hanky reminds
me of? First day I met you.

1157
01:05:09,649 --> 01:05:11,480
First day you lied to me.

1158
01:05:11,684 --> 01:05:13,515
-I didn't lie to you.
-You did too.

1159
01:05:13,720 --> 01:05:15,881
-No, I didn't. I did not.
-Yes, you did. Did too.

1160
01:05:17,824 --> 01:05:18,813
You did too.

1161
01:05:19,025 --> 01:05:22,188
I thought all that Fox stuff
was so charming. F-O-X.

1162
01:05:22,395 --> 01:05:23,828
Well, I didn't lie about it.

1163
01:05:25,098 --> 01:05:26,895
"Joe"? "Just call me Joe."

1164
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:27,930
Sure.

1165
01:05:28,168 --> 01:05:31,137
As if you were a stupid
22-year-old girl with no last name.

1166
01:05:31,337 --> 01:05:33,430
"Hi, I'm kimberly." "Hi, I'm Janice."

1167
01:05:33,673 --> 01:05:35,732
Don't they know you're supposed
to have a last name?

1168
01:05:35,942 --> 01:05:38,308
It's like they're an entire generation
of cocktail waitresses.

1169
01:05:38,511 --> 01:05:39,500
Look.

1170
01:05:41,548 --> 01:05:44,039
I am not
a 22-year-old cocktail waitress.

1171
01:05:44,250 --> 01:05:45,148
That is not what I meant.

1172
01:05:45,351 --> 01:05:47,444
When I said the thing about
the cans of olive oil...

1173
01:05:47,687 --> 01:05:48,847
...that's not what I meant.

1174
01:05:49,189 --> 01:05:53,523
You poor, sad multimillionaire.
I feel so sorry for you.

1175
01:05:59,566 --> 01:06:01,363
Take a wild guess
that's not him either?

1176
01:06:03,703 --> 01:06:05,864
So who is he, I wonder?

1177
01:06:06,473 --> 01:06:09,203
Certainly not, I gather,
the world's greatest living expert...

1178
01:06:09,409 --> 01:06:11,468
...on Julius and Ethel Rosenberg.

1179
01:06:12,111 --> 01:06:14,477
But somebody else entirely different.

1180
01:06:15,248 --> 01:06:17,148
Will you be mean to him too?

1181
01:06:17,383 --> 01:06:18,816
No, I will not.

1182
01:06:19,252 --> 01:06:22,483
The man who is coming here
tonight is completely unlike you.

1183
01:06:22,755 --> 01:06:25,849
The man who is coming here
tonight is kind and funny.

1184
01:06:26,059 --> 01:06:28,323
He's got the most wonderful
sense of humor.

1185
01:06:28,561 --> 01:06:29,550
But...

1186
01:06:30,163 --> 01:06:31,721
...he's not here.

1187
01:06:32,632 --> 01:06:34,691
If he's not here, he has a reason...

1188
01:06:34,901 --> 01:06:38,234
...because there is not a cruel
or careless bone in his body.

1189
01:06:38,438 --> 01:06:40,702
I wouldn't expect you
to understand anybody like that.

1190
01:06:40,907 --> 01:06:43,705
You with your theme park, multilevel...

1191
01:06:43,910 --> 01:06:45,878
...homogenize-the-world mochaccinoland.

1192
01:06:46,079 --> 01:06:47,478
You've deluded
yourself into thinking...

1193
01:06:47,680 --> 01:06:50,581
...you're some sort of benefactor
bringing books to the masses.

1194
01:06:50,850 --> 01:06:53,512
But no one will ever remember you,
Joe Fox.

1195
01:06:53,753 --> 01:06:55,880
And maybe no one
will remember me either.

1196
01:06:56,089 --> 01:06:58,353
But plenty of people remember my mother.

1197
01:06:58,591 --> 01:06:59,888
And they think she was fine...

1198
01:07:00,093 --> 01:07:02,755
...and they think her store
was something special.

1199
01:07:04,163 --> 01:07:06,688
You are nothing but a suit.

1200
01:07:20,213 --> 01:07:21,805
That's my cue.

1201
01:07:25,451 --> 01:07:26,383
Good night.

1202
01:08:42,028 --> 01:08:46,158
So then the agent asks for
$600,000 and I said to her:

1203
01:08:46,366 --> 01:08:49,597
"If you think I'm even going
to talk to you...

1204
01:08:49,802 --> 01:08:51,736
...about paying that kind of
advance for an author...

1205
01:08:51,938 --> 01:08:56,671
...whose last book is being used
as trivets all over the whole world...

1206
01:08:56,876 --> 01:08:59,140
...you are completely crazy."

1207
01:08:59,545 --> 01:09:03,174
She was insulting and provocative.
The only thing pleasant about her...

1208
01:09:04,083 --> 01:09:06,984
...was the way her hair
fell across her forehead.

1209
01:09:07,220 --> 01:09:09,518
But underneath
that disagreeable exterior...

1210
01:09:09,722 --> 01:09:11,189
...she may turn out to be a real--

1211
01:09:11,391 --> 01:09:13,291
A real bitch.

1212
01:09:13,493 --> 01:09:14,653
Let's not talk about it.

1213
01:09:14,861 --> 01:09:17,523
I'm going back to the office.
I'm sure you have work.

1214
01:09:17,730 --> 01:09:18,788
Not really.

1215
01:09:18,998 --> 01:09:22,058
This place is a well-oiled
machine, my friend.

1216
01:09:23,970 --> 01:09:26,404
So? What happened?

1217
01:09:26,839 --> 01:09:28,306
He never came.

1218
01:09:28,508 --> 01:09:29,566
He stood you up.

1219
01:09:29,776 --> 01:09:33,405
I wouldn't characterize it that way.
I think something happened.

1220
01:09:33,613 --> 01:09:37,481
Something terrible and unexpected
that made it impossible for him to....

1221
01:09:38,117 --> 01:09:40,950
What if he showed up,
took one look at me and left?

1222
01:09:41,154 --> 01:09:43,179
Not possible.

1223
01:09:43,756 --> 01:09:46,816
Maybe there was a subway accident.

1224
01:09:47,026 --> 01:09:48,015
Absolutely.

1225
01:09:48,261 --> 01:09:50,695
A train got trapped underground
with him inside.

1226
01:09:50,930 --> 01:09:51,726
And no phone.

1227
01:09:51,931 --> 01:09:54,399
And you know how those
express trains create suction.

1228
01:09:54,600 --> 01:09:56,465
He got sucked onto the tracks.

1229
01:09:56,669 --> 01:09:57,693
The third rail.

1230
01:09:58,104 --> 01:09:59,696
He's toast.

1231
01:09:59,939 --> 01:10:00,871
What happened?

1232
01:10:02,108 --> 01:10:03,507
He was unable to make it.

1233
01:10:04,177 --> 01:10:05,508
He stood you up?

1234
01:10:08,614 --> 01:10:09,512
Maybe...

1235
01:10:10,183 --> 01:10:13,152
...he had a car accident.
Those cab drivers are maniacs.

1236
01:10:13,352 --> 01:10:17,516
They hit something and you slam
into that plastic partition.

1237
01:10:17,724 --> 01:10:21,091
Or his elbows could be in splints,
so he couldn't dial.

1238
01:10:21,294 --> 01:10:23,660
Or he could be unconscious.

1239
01:10:23,863 --> 01:10:24,852
In a coma.

1240
01:10:25,465 --> 01:10:27,296
Stuck in intensive care.

1241
01:10:27,567 --> 01:10:29,159
With that heart monitor beeping.

1242
01:10:29,368 --> 01:10:30,528
And, like....

1243
01:10:30,737 --> 01:10:31,795
No phone.

1244
01:10:40,246 --> 01:10:41,076
What are you saying?

1245
01:10:42,515 --> 01:10:43,482
It could be.

1246
01:10:43,883 --> 01:10:46,374
He was arrested
two blocks from the caf.

1247
01:10:46,586 --> 01:10:48,315
Is there a picture?

1248
01:10:51,524 --> 01:10:52,821
So that explains it.

1249
01:10:54,026 --> 01:10:54,890
He was in jail.

1250
01:10:56,529 --> 01:10:57,587
And there was a phone.

1251
01:10:57,830 --> 01:10:59,957
But he only got one call,
so he had to call his lawyer.

1252
01:11:00,166 --> 01:11:02,066
You are so lucky.

1253
01:11:02,502 --> 01:11:03,400
You could be dead.

1254
01:11:06,005 --> 01:11:08,803
He couldn't possibly
be the Rooftop killer!

1255
01:11:09,008 --> 01:11:12,273
Remember when you thought
Frank might be the Unabomber?

1256
01:11:12,512 --> 01:11:13,501
Well...

1257
01:11:14,180 --> 01:11:15,579
...that was different.

1258
01:11:16,349 --> 01:11:18,647
How long did you sit there all alone?

1259
01:11:18,851 --> 01:11:21,217
Not long. Joe Fox came in.

1260
01:11:22,455 --> 01:11:24,821
I don't want to talk about it.
Let's just get to work.

1261
01:11:25,024 --> 01:11:28,187
There's got to be something to do.
There's always something to do.

1262
01:11:29,428 --> 01:11:30,258
Look at this.

1263
01:11:30,463 --> 01:11:32,522
He looks kind of cute.

1264
01:11:34,634 --> 01:11:35,828
So?

1265
01:11:36,035 --> 01:11:38,868
He was unavoidably detained.

1266
01:11:39,205 --> 01:11:41,469
He stood you up?

1267
01:11:45,545 --> 01:11:47,740
I've been thinking about you.

1268
01:11:48,714 --> 01:11:51,945
Last night I went to meet you,
and you weren't there.

1269
01:11:53,719 --> 01:11:55,016
I wish I knew why.

1270
01:11:55,221 --> 01:11:57,553
I felt so foolish.

1271
01:11:59,392 --> 01:12:01,292
As I waited, someone else showed up.

1272
01:12:01,494 --> 01:12:04,793
A man who has made
my professional life a misery.

1273
01:12:04,997 --> 01:12:07,465
And an amazing thing happened.

1274
01:12:09,735 --> 01:12:11,600
I was able, for the first time...

1275
01:12:11,804 --> 01:12:13,931
...to say the exact thing
I wanted to say...

1276
01:12:14,140 --> 01:12:17,075
...at the exact moment
I wanted to say it.

1277
01:12:17,577 --> 01:12:21,343
And of course,
afterwards I felt terrible...

1278
01:12:21,747 --> 01:12:23,977
...just as you said I would.

1279
01:12:24,750 --> 01:12:26,012
I was cruel...

1280
01:12:26,219 --> 01:12:27,709
...and I'm never cruel.

1281
01:12:28,521 --> 01:12:31,547
Though I can hardly believe
what I said mattered to this man.

1282
01:12:31,757 --> 01:12:34,817
To him, I am just a bug to be crushed.

1283
01:12:35,595 --> 01:12:36,892
But what if it did?

1284
01:12:37,096 --> 01:12:38,996
No matter what he's done to me...

1285
01:12:39,198 --> 01:12:41,063
...there is no excuse for my behavior.

1286
01:12:41,834 --> 01:12:43,165
Anyway...

1287
01:12:43,402 --> 01:12:45,870
...l so wanted to talk to you.

1288
01:12:46,706 --> 01:12:49,174
I hope you have a good reason
for not being there last night.

1289
01:12:49,375 --> 01:12:53,106
You don't seem like the kind of
person who'd do something like that.

1290
01:12:53,779 --> 01:12:55,906
The odd thing about this
form of communication...

1291
01:12:56,115 --> 01:12:58,913
...is you're more likely to talk
about nothing than something.

1292
01:12:59,118 --> 01:13:00,779
But ljust want to say...

1293
01:13:01,020 --> 01:13:04,649
...that all this nothing has meant
more to me than so many...

1294
01:13:04,857 --> 01:13:06,518
...somethings.

1295
01:13:07,860 --> 01:13:09,623
So, thanks.

1296
01:13:25,878 --> 01:13:27,368
Goodbye.

1297
01:14:21,267 --> 01:14:22,996
I am in...

1298
01:14:26,439 --> 01:14:27,963
... Vancouver.

1299
01:14:37,683 --> 01:14:38,877
I was stuck in a meeting...

1300
01:14:39,118 --> 01:14:40,813
...which I couldn't get out of...

1301
01:14:41,020 --> 01:14:42,282
...and...

1302
01:14:42,655 --> 01:14:44,486
...the electricity went
out in the building.

1303
01:14:44,690 --> 01:14:46,021
And...

1304
01:14:46,225 --> 01:14:47,590
...we were trapped...

1305
01:14:47,793 --> 01:14:51,422
...on the 38th floor, and...

1306
01:14:51,630 --> 01:14:54,190
...the telephone system blew too...

1307
01:15:01,140 --> 01:15:03,199
...amazingly enough.

1308
01:15:38,344 --> 01:15:39,777
Dear friend.

1309
01:15:43,015 --> 01:15:46,007
I cannot tell you
what happened last night.

1310
01:15:47,253 --> 01:15:49,346
But I beg you
from the bottom of my heart...

1311
01:15:49,555 --> 01:15:51,716
...to forgive me for not being there.

1312
01:16:00,499 --> 01:16:02,091
For what happened.

1313
01:16:04,537 --> 01:16:08,268
I feel terrible that you
found yourself in a situation...

1314
01:16:08,474 --> 01:16:11,375
...that caused you additional pain.

1315
01:16:13,612 --> 01:16:15,580
But I'm absolutely sure...

1316
01:16:15,915 --> 01:16:19,476
...that whatever you said
last night was provoked.

1317
01:16:19,718 --> 01:16:21,379
Even deserved.

1318
01:16:24,890 --> 01:16:29,122
Everyone says things they regret
when they're worried or stressed.

1319
01:16:31,163 --> 01:16:33,996
You were expecting to see
someone you trusted...

1320
01:16:34,733 --> 01:16:37,167
...and met the enemy instead.

1321
01:16:40,639 --> 01:16:42,664
The fault is mine.

1322
01:16:45,911 --> 01:16:47,845
Someday I'll explain everything.

1323
01:16:48,247 --> 01:16:49,509
Meanwhile...

1324
01:16:49,748 --> 01:16:51,238
...l'm still here.

1325
01:16:52,184 --> 01:16:53,014
Talk to me.

1326
01:16:53,252 --> 01:16:56,278
Did he say anything about
wanting to meet you again?

1327
01:16:56,489 --> 01:16:58,650
No, not really.

1328
01:16:58,858 --> 01:17:00,189
Listen, it doesn't matter.

1329
01:17:00,426 --> 01:17:03,156
We'll be like George Bernard Shaw
and Mrs. Patrick Campbell.

1330
01:17:03,362 --> 01:17:04,761
We'll write letters our whole lives.

1331
01:17:06,465 --> 01:17:09,263
Thank you for the scones.
They look lovely.

1332
01:17:09,468 --> 01:17:12,767
Birdie, where was this one taken?

1333
01:17:13,205 --> 01:17:14,172
Seville.

1334
01:17:14,373 --> 01:17:16,432
When you fell madly in love?

1335
01:17:17,476 --> 01:17:20,502
So, dearie,
what have you decided to do?

1336
01:17:20,779 --> 01:17:23,270
Close. We're going to close.

1337
01:17:24,183 --> 01:17:25,115
Close.

1338
01:17:25,718 --> 01:17:27,185
Closing the store...

1339
01:17:27,386 --> 01:17:29,854
...is the brave thing to do.

1340
01:17:30,856 --> 01:17:32,585
You are such a liar.

1341
01:17:32,791 --> 01:17:33,621
But thank you.

1342
01:17:34,793 --> 01:17:38,957
You are daring to imagine that you
could have a different life.

1343
01:17:40,799 --> 01:17:44,291
I know it doesn't feel like that.
You feel like a big fat failure now.

1344
01:17:45,971 --> 01:17:47,131
But you're not.

1345
01:17:47,473 --> 01:17:51,637
You are marching into the unknown,
armed with...

1346
01:17:51,844 --> 01:17:52,811
...nothing.

1347
01:17:53,546 --> 01:17:55,138
Have a sandwich.

1348
01:17:56,248 --> 01:17:57,306
Well, not nothing.

1349
01:17:57,683 --> 01:17:59,674
I have a little money saved.

1350
01:17:59,885 --> 01:18:03,150
If you need more, ask me.
I'm very rich.

1351
01:18:03,355 --> 01:18:06,813
I bought lntel at six.

1352
01:18:10,129 --> 01:18:11,323
I suppose you want me...

1353
01:18:11,530 --> 01:18:12,929
...to tell you who it was...

1354
01:18:13,165 --> 01:18:15,497
...l fell madly in love with.

1355
01:18:16,402 --> 01:18:17,664
But I'm not going to tell.

1356
01:18:18,337 --> 01:18:19,827
Who was it?

1357
01:18:20,706 --> 01:18:23,766
Come on, tell. That's so mean.

1358
01:18:24,944 --> 01:18:26,138
But so romantic.

1359
01:18:26,345 --> 01:18:28,836
-It wasn't meant to be.
-Why not?

1360
01:18:29,900 --> 01:18:31,561
He ran Spain.

1361
01:18:32,703 --> 01:18:33,567
Spain?

1362
01:18:34,171 --> 01:18:35,536
The country. He ran it.

1363
01:18:35,739 --> 01:18:37,001
It was his job.

1364
01:18:37,240 --> 01:18:39,003
And then he died.

1365
01:18:39,242 --> 01:18:40,834
Just as well.

1366
01:18:41,078 --> 01:18:42,602
Milk or lemon?

1367
01:18:43,947 --> 01:18:47,212
She fell in love with
Generalissimo Franco.

1368
01:18:47,417 --> 01:18:49,476
Don't say that.
We don't know that for sure.

1369
01:18:49,686 --> 01:18:52,712
Who else could it have been?
It was probably around 1 960.

1370
01:18:52,923 --> 01:18:55,585
-Do you want some popcorn?
-I can't believe this.

1371
01:18:56,793 --> 01:18:58,761
It's not like
he was something normal...

1372
01:18:58,962 --> 01:19:01,362
...like a socialist, or an anarchist.

1373
01:19:01,598 --> 01:19:03,031
It happened in Spain.

1374
01:19:03,266 --> 01:19:05,496
People do stupid things
in foreign countries.

1375
01:19:05,702 --> 01:19:08,967
Absolutely. They buy leather jackets
for much more than they're worth.

1376
01:19:09,172 --> 01:19:12,198
But they don't fall in love
with fascist dictators.

1377
01:19:18,448 --> 01:19:21,349
Birdie is a very special person to me.

1378
01:19:21,551 --> 01:19:24,281
She is practically my surrogate mother.

1379
01:19:24,554 --> 01:19:27,352
-She's out of her mind.
-She is not.

1380
01:19:27,557 --> 01:19:29,149
I could never be with anyone...

1381
01:19:29,359 --> 01:19:31,884
...who doesn't take
politics as seriously as I do.

1382
01:19:32,462 --> 01:19:33,292
Do you mind?

1383
01:19:33,497 --> 01:19:34,862
A hot dog is singing.

1384
01:19:35,065 --> 01:19:37,727
You need quiet
while a hot dog is singing?

1385
01:19:41,405 --> 01:19:43,464
I have something to tell you, Frank.

1386
01:19:45,042 --> 01:19:46,236
I didn't vote.

1387
01:19:46,476 --> 01:19:47,272
What?

1388
01:19:47,477 --> 01:19:49,342
In the last mayoral election...

1389
01:19:49,546 --> 01:19:52,037
...when Rudy Giuliani was running
against Ruth Messinger.

1390
01:19:52,716 --> 01:19:54,377
I went to get a manicure.

1391
01:19:54,751 --> 01:19:56,810
And forgot to vote.

1392
01:19:57,220 --> 01:19:58,653
Since when do you get manicures?

1393
01:19:58,855 --> 01:20:01,983
I suppose you could never be with
a woman who got manicures?

1394
01:20:02,192 --> 01:20:03,819
Never mind. It's okay.

1395
01:20:04,161 --> 01:20:04,991
I forgive you.

1396
01:20:06,430 --> 01:20:07,658
You forgive me?

1397
01:20:16,540 --> 01:20:19,566
Excuse me, I'm sorry. Excuse me.

1398
01:20:20,710 --> 01:20:22,940
This has been a big week.
You're closing the store.

1399
01:20:23,180 --> 01:20:26,240
No, it's not that. Really, it's not.

1400
01:20:26,450 --> 01:20:29,419
I know. That was terrible of me.

1401
01:20:30,887 --> 01:20:31,911
What was terrible?

1402
01:20:32,122 --> 01:20:35,023
Jumping all over you
when I'm the one....

1403
01:20:36,460 --> 01:20:38,951
God, I don't even know how to say this.

1404
01:20:40,130 --> 01:20:41,427
What is it?

1405
01:20:42,299 --> 01:20:43,391
What?

1406
01:20:45,035 --> 01:20:47,560
You're a wonderful person, kathleen.

1407
01:20:47,771 --> 01:20:49,398
So are you.

1408
01:20:49,706 --> 01:20:52,300
And I'm so honored that you'd
want to be with me...

1409
01:20:52,509 --> 01:20:54,033
...because you would never be...

1410
01:20:54,244 --> 01:20:55,973
...with anyone...

1411
01:20:56,213 --> 01:20:58,044
...who wasn't truly worthy.

1412
01:20:58,248 --> 01:20:59,840
I feel exactly...

1413
01:21:00,050 --> 01:21:01,278
...the same way.

1414
01:21:01,718 --> 01:21:05,051
Don't say that.
That makes it worse.

1415
01:21:05,255 --> 01:21:06,279
What?

1416
01:21:08,258 --> 01:21:09,486
You don't love me.

1417
01:21:16,566 --> 01:21:17,555
Me either.

1418
01:21:18,568 --> 01:21:19,660
You don't love me?

1419
01:21:22,139 --> 01:21:23,231
No.

1420
01:21:23,473 --> 01:21:25,464
But we're so right for each other.

1421
01:21:25,675 --> 01:21:27,506
I know.

1422
01:21:30,347 --> 01:21:32,907
Well, is there someone else?

1423
01:21:33,950 --> 01:21:36,418
That woman on television, Sidney-Ann.

1424
01:21:38,088 --> 01:21:40,181
Nothing has happened or anything,
but....

1425
01:21:41,324 --> 01:21:43,121
Is she a Republican?

1426
01:21:43,426 --> 01:21:46,088
I can't help myself.

1427
01:21:55,138 --> 01:21:56,366
What about you?

1428
01:21:56,806 --> 01:21:58,671
Is there someone else?

1429
01:21:59,843 --> 01:22:01,003
No.

1430
01:22:02,179 --> 01:22:04,010
No. But...

1431
01:22:05,782 --> 01:22:08,444
...but there is the dream
of someone else.

1432
01:22:36,046 --> 01:22:38,480
Honey, grab a copy of
The Trumpet of the Swan.

1433
01:22:38,682 --> 01:22:40,547
This is a tragedy.

1434
01:22:42,052 --> 01:22:43,246
Are these chairs for sale?

1435
01:22:43,486 --> 01:22:44,817
Anything not nailed down.

1436
01:22:45,055 --> 01:22:46,545
Ten dollars, it's yours.

1437
01:22:46,756 --> 01:22:48,189
What are you going to do now?

1438
01:22:48,391 --> 01:22:52,293
I think I'll take some time.
I'm almost looking forward to it.

1439
01:22:52,495 --> 01:22:53,553
Good luck to you.

1440
01:22:55,765 --> 01:22:58,859
I came here every Saturday
when I was a little girl.

1441
01:22:59,069 --> 01:23:02,368
I remember when your mother
gave me Anne of Green Gables.

1442
01:23:02,572 --> 01:23:04,802
"Read it with a box of kleenex,"
she said.

1443
01:23:05,008 --> 01:23:06,498
That's what she told me.

1444
01:23:06,710 --> 01:23:07,677
Could someone help me?

1445
01:23:07,877 --> 01:23:09,105
She's looking down on you right now.

1446
01:23:09,713 --> 01:23:11,078
I'm sure she is.

1447
01:23:11,281 --> 01:23:13,909
Why don't we bomb Fox Books?

1448
01:25:03,026 --> 01:25:03,958
Do you have the "shoe" books?

1449
01:25:05,628 --> 01:25:06,959
The "shoe" books?

1450
01:25:07,297 --> 01:25:08,457
Who's the author?

1451
01:25:08,665 --> 01:25:09,654
I don't know.

1452
01:25:09,866 --> 01:25:12,494
My friend told me my daughter
has to read the "shoe" books...

1453
01:25:12,702 --> 01:25:14,567
...so here I am.

1454
01:25:14,804 --> 01:25:16,135
Noel Streatfeild.

1455
01:25:18,708 --> 01:25:21,871
Noel Streatfeild wrote
Ballet Shoes and Skating Shoes...

1456
01:25:22,078 --> 01:25:23,136
...and Theatre Shoes...

1457
01:25:23,346 --> 01:25:25,109
...and Dancing Shoes and....

1458
01:25:25,315 --> 01:25:28,079
I'd start with Ballet Shoes first,
it's my favorite.

1459
01:25:29,152 --> 01:25:30,380
Although Skating Shoes...

1460
01:25:30,587 --> 01:25:32,487
...is completely wonderful.

1461
01:25:33,656 --> 01:25:35,055
But it's out of print.

1462
01:25:35,992 --> 01:25:37,482
Streatfeild.

1463
01:25:38,395 --> 01:25:39,327
How do you spell that?

1464
01:25:41,164 --> 01:25:45,897
S-T-R-E-A-T-F-E-l-L-D.

1465
01:25:47,203 --> 01:25:48,693
Thank you.

1466
01:25:49,439 --> 01:25:52,101
Kathleen Kelly. I swear it was
like her name was in the air.

1467
01:25:52,675 --> 01:25:53,664
Just like that?

1468
01:25:53,877 --> 01:25:55,708
Everyone was talking about her today.

1469
01:25:55,912 --> 01:25:58,847
kathleen kelly and her "situation."

1470
01:25:59,048 --> 01:26:03,678
And I was thinking that she'd make
a great children's book editor.

1471
01:26:03,920 --> 01:26:05,478
What makes you think that?

1472
01:26:05,688 --> 01:26:06,586
Well...

1473
01:26:06,790 --> 01:26:08,348
...she knows everything.

1474
01:26:08,558 --> 01:26:11,527
She has flawless taste.
She's famous for it.

1475
01:26:11,728 --> 01:26:16,097
Salesmen swear by her. If she likes
the book, it sells. Period.

1476
01:26:16,366 --> 01:26:18,163
So you're going to offer her a job?

1477
01:26:18,368 --> 01:26:20,336
What else has she got to do?

1478
01:26:20,537 --> 01:26:22,027
Now that she's destitute.

1479
01:26:22,238 --> 01:26:23,432
Thanks to you.

1480
01:26:23,640 --> 01:26:25,369
I don't see her working for you.

1481
01:26:25,575 --> 01:26:26,405
Why not?

1482
01:26:26,609 --> 01:26:28,236
Because she lacks the killer instinct.

1483
01:26:28,445 --> 01:26:30,572
She's never fired anybody.
Look at that little shop of hers.

1484
01:26:30,780 --> 01:26:32,805
Those people have been there forever.

1485
01:26:33,149 --> 01:26:35,174
Till recently, when they all
lost their jobs.

1486
01:26:35,385 --> 01:26:37,046
Thanks to you.

1487
01:26:37,587 --> 01:26:39,612
Hold the elevator!

1488
01:26:42,225 --> 01:26:43,385
Mr. Fox.

1489
01:26:43,593 --> 01:26:45,254
Hello, Charlie.

1490
01:26:46,329 --> 01:26:47,887
I love how you've forgotten...

1491
01:26:48,097 --> 01:26:50,622
...you've had any role in her
current situation.

1492
01:26:50,834 --> 01:26:52,062
It's so obtuse.

1493
01:26:52,635 --> 01:26:54,603
It's so insensitive.

1494
01:26:54,804 --> 01:26:56,237
Reminds me of someone.

1495
01:26:56,439 --> 01:26:58,464
Who? Who does it remind me of?

1496
01:27:00,009 --> 01:27:01,306
Me.

1497
01:27:06,182 --> 01:27:07,240
What is going on?

1498
01:27:07,917 --> 01:27:08,906
Could be stuck.

1499
01:27:16,659 --> 01:27:17,751
What are you doing?

1500
01:27:18,761 --> 01:27:20,922
I hope this thing doesn't
plummet to the basement.

1501
01:27:21,931 --> 01:27:23,091
Can it do that?

1502
01:27:24,300 --> 01:27:26,768
It cannot plummet to the basement.

1503
01:27:27,670 --> 01:27:29,695
Hi, this is Joe Fox. Who's this?

1504
01:27:29,939 --> 01:27:30,928
Juan?

1505
01:27:31,374 --> 01:27:33,308
Juan, we are stuck in the elevator...

1506
01:27:33,510 --> 01:27:35,239
...between the sixth and seventh floor.

1507
01:27:35,445 --> 01:27:36,469
There's four of us.

1508
01:27:36,679 --> 01:27:38,112
If you don't get your ass...

1509
01:27:38,314 --> 01:27:39,576
...up here in two shakes...

1510
01:27:39,782 --> 01:27:42,376
...and get us the hell out of here...!

1511
01:27:43,786 --> 01:27:44,753
Listen...

1512
01:27:44,954 --> 01:27:46,148
...call the super...

1513
01:27:46,356 --> 01:27:47,550
...and then 9-1 -1 .

1514
01:27:49,092 --> 01:27:51,060
9-1 -1 .

1515
01:27:51,461 --> 01:27:53,361
The fire department, that's right.

1516
01:27:54,831 --> 01:27:56,560
Thank you very much.

1517
01:27:59,502 --> 01:28:00,434
Everyone should jump in the air.

1518
01:28:01,004 --> 01:28:01,834
What?

1519
01:28:02,772 --> 01:28:03,670
We jump...

1520
01:28:03,873 --> 01:28:06,740
...the elevator thinks
no one is here. And it opens.

1521
01:28:11,214 --> 01:28:12,203
One...

1522
01:28:12,415 --> 01:28:13,313
...two...

1523
01:28:13,516 --> 01:28:15,108
....three, jump.

1524
01:28:22,392 --> 01:28:23,825
If I ever get out of here...

1525
01:28:25,028 --> 01:28:27,360
...l'm going to start speaking
to my momma.

1526
01:28:28,765 --> 01:28:31,461
Wonder what she's doing
right this very minute?

1527
01:28:32,201 --> 01:28:33,964
If I ever get out of here...

1528
01:28:34,604 --> 01:28:36,538
...l'm marrying Orit.

1529
01:28:37,106 --> 01:28:38,596
I love her.

1530
01:28:38,975 --> 01:28:40,533
I should marry her.

1531
01:28:40,743 --> 01:28:42,438
I don't know what's been stopping me.

1532
01:28:49,218 --> 01:28:51,812
If I ever get out of here,
I'm having my eyes lasered.

1533
01:28:59,295 --> 01:29:01,024
If I ever get out of here....

1534
01:29:01,230 --> 01:29:02,492
Where are my Tic-Tacs?

1535
01:29:06,569 --> 01:29:07,900
What?

1536
01:29:10,773 --> 01:29:11,797
I came home tonight.

1537
01:29:12,008 --> 01:29:14,704
And got into the elevator
to go to my apartment.

1538
01:29:14,911 --> 01:29:17,971
An hour later
I got out of the elevator...

1539
01:29:18,181 --> 01:29:20,445
...and Brinkley and I moved out.

1540
01:29:20,650 --> 01:29:23,414
Suddenly everything had become clear.

1541
01:29:23,820 --> 01:29:25,253
It's a long story...

1542
01:29:25,688 --> 01:29:28,555
...full of the personal details
we avoid so carefully.

1543
01:29:28,758 --> 01:29:30,316
Let mejust say...

1544
01:29:30,760 --> 01:29:33,354
...there was a man sitting
in the elevator with me...

1545
01:29:33,696 --> 01:29:36,290
...who knew exactly what he wanted...

1546
01:29:36,866 --> 01:29:40,529
...and I found myself wishing
I were as lucky as he.

1547
01:29:43,940 --> 01:29:47,432
People are always telling you
that change is a good thing.

1548
01:29:47,810 --> 01:29:49,141
But all they're really saying...

1549
01:29:49,345 --> 01:29:51,609
...is that something you didn't
want to happen at all...

1550
01:29:52,048 --> 01:29:53,606
...has happened.

1551
01:29:54,884 --> 01:29:57,216
My store is closing this week.

1552
01:29:57,620 --> 01:29:59,178
I own a store.

1553
01:29:59,455 --> 01:30:01,150
Did I ever tell you that?

1554
01:30:01,624 --> 01:30:03,421
It's a lovely store.

1555
01:30:03,626 --> 01:30:06,254
And in a week it will be
something really depressing...

1556
01:30:06,462 --> 01:30:08,293
...like a Baby Gap.

1557
01:30:11,000 --> 01:30:12,729
Soon we'lljust be a memory.

1558
01:30:12,969 --> 01:30:15,130
In fact, someone,
some foolish person...

1559
01:30:15,338 --> 01:30:17,772
...will probably think
it's a tribute to this city.

1560
01:30:17,974 --> 01:30:19,532
The way it keeps changing on you.

1561
01:30:19,742 --> 01:30:22,734
Or the way you can never
count on it, or something.

1562
01:30:22,979 --> 01:30:25,243
I know, because that's
the sort of thing I'm always saying.

1563
01:30:25,481 --> 01:30:27,312
But the truth is...

1564
01:30:28,384 --> 01:30:30,079
...l'm heartbroken.

1565
01:30:32,555 --> 01:30:35,217
I feel as if a part of me has died...

1566
01:30:35,425 --> 01:30:38,155
...and my mother has died
all over again.

1567
01:30:40,997 --> 01:30:41,895
And no one...

1568
01:30:42,098 --> 01:30:43,929
...can ever make it right.

1569
01:32:48,858 --> 01:32:50,257
What happened?

1570
01:32:52,762 --> 01:32:54,059
Oh, hell.

1571
01:32:56,098 --> 01:32:56,996
How are you?

1572
01:32:57,200 --> 01:32:59,031
You know, Dad, you did pretty well.

1573
01:32:59,268 --> 01:33:00,360
At least you didn't marry her.

1574
01:33:00,603 --> 01:33:02,161
Welcome aboard.

1575
01:33:02,772 --> 01:33:04,433
It lasted awhile.

1576
01:33:20,456 --> 01:33:21,787
You know...

1577
01:33:22,758 --> 01:33:24,817
...l've stayed on this boat after...

1578
01:33:25,695 --> 01:33:26,923
...let's see...

1579
01:33:27,163 --> 01:33:28,596
...well, your mother.

1580
01:33:29,599 --> 01:33:31,157
Laurette, the ballet dancer.

1581
01:33:31,834 --> 01:33:32,892
My nanny.

1582
01:33:33,669 --> 01:33:35,068
She was the nanny?

1583
01:33:37,607 --> 01:33:39,165
I forgot that.

1584
01:33:40,009 --> 01:33:41,237
How ironic.

1585
01:33:41,444 --> 01:33:43,708
And then there was the ice skater.

1586
01:33:43,913 --> 01:33:44,937
Also my nanny.

1587
01:33:45,181 --> 01:33:46,011
Really?

1588
01:33:47,850 --> 01:33:49,818
Well, that's amazingly ironic.

1589
01:33:51,020 --> 01:33:52,180
And then there was Sybil.

1590
01:33:52,388 --> 01:33:53,719
The...

1591
01:33:54,056 --> 01:33:54,988
...it's an "A" word.

1592
01:33:55,191 --> 01:33:56,021
Astrologer.

1593
01:33:56,392 --> 01:33:57,950
Exactly. Yeah.

1594
01:33:58,461 --> 01:34:01,487
Whose moon turned out to be
in someone else's house.

1595
01:34:02,064 --> 01:34:03,258
Just like Gillian.

1596
01:34:04,901 --> 01:34:06,095
Gillian ran off with someone?

1597
01:34:06,302 --> 01:34:07,360
The nanny.

1598
01:34:08,104 --> 01:34:09,093
Nanny Maureen?

1599
01:34:13,809 --> 01:34:16,209
Gillian ran off with Nanny Maureen.

1600
01:34:16,779 --> 01:34:18,212
You got it.

1601
01:34:18,481 --> 01:34:20,540
It's incredibly ironic.

1602
01:34:20,816 --> 01:34:21,680
That's true.

1603
01:34:21,884 --> 01:34:23,818
No other word for it.

1604
01:34:24,220 --> 01:34:26,211
Well, who's better than us?

1605
01:34:26,722 --> 01:34:28,849
Father and son, together at last.

1606
01:34:29,325 --> 01:34:31,122
Who did you say you broke up with?

1607
01:34:31,727 --> 01:34:33,319
Patricia.

1608
01:34:33,562 --> 01:34:34,392
You met her.

1609
01:34:35,231 --> 01:34:36,061
Would I like her?

1610
01:34:38,734 --> 01:34:40,395
Just kidding, son.

1611
01:34:41,570 --> 01:34:43,902
Now, is this beautiful or what?

1612
01:34:44,907 --> 01:34:47,501
I'll be living out of a suitcase for...

1613
01:34:47,743 --> 01:34:48,710
...at least 3 weeks.

1614
01:34:49,245 --> 01:34:52,737
And then there's
the inevitable legal hassle.

1615
01:34:52,949 --> 01:34:54,382
More of your inheritance
down the drain.

1616
01:34:54,583 --> 01:34:56,050
Don't you worry about it.

1617
01:34:56,452 --> 01:34:57,441
I won't.

1618
01:34:57,653 --> 01:34:59,746
I'll just have to meet someone new,
that's all.

1619
01:34:59,956 --> 01:35:01,082
That's the easy part.

1620
01:35:01,290 --> 01:35:02,314
Right, yeah.

1621
01:35:02,525 --> 01:35:05,050
A snap to find
the one person in the world...

1622
01:35:05,261 --> 01:35:06,523
...who fills your heart with joy.

1623
01:35:06,762 --> 01:35:08,491
Well, don't be ridiculous.

1624
01:35:08,698 --> 01:35:11,428
Have I ever been with anybody
who fit that description?

1625
01:35:12,702 --> 01:35:13,532
Have you?

1626
01:35:41,297 --> 01:35:42,127
Who is it?

1627
01:35:44,233 --> 01:35:46,133
It's Joe Fox.

1628
01:35:47,837 --> 01:35:49,702
What are you doing here?

1629
01:35:52,074 --> 01:35:53,166
May I please come up?

1630
01:35:53,376 --> 01:35:54,502
No, I don't....

1631
01:35:54,710 --> 01:35:57,804
No, I don't really think that
that is a good idea, because...

1632
01:35:58,014 --> 01:35:59,481
...l have a...

1633
01:36:00,149 --> 01:36:01,639
...l have a terrible...

1634
01:36:01,884 --> 01:36:03,249
...cold.

1635
01:36:07,723 --> 01:36:08,781
Can you hear that?

1636
01:36:10,893 --> 01:36:13,919
I'm sniffling,
and I'm not really awake...

1637
01:36:14,163 --> 01:36:15,824
...and I'm taking echinacea...

1638
01:36:16,032 --> 01:36:18,091
...and vitamin C and sleeping
practically...

1639
01:36:18,334 --> 01:36:20,768
...24 hours a day.
I have a temperature.

1640
01:36:21,237 --> 01:36:25,139
And I think I'm contagious.
So I would...

1641
01:36:25,341 --> 01:36:28,174
...l would really appreciate it
if you would just go away.

1642
01:36:40,356 --> 01:36:42,017
Just a second!

1643
01:36:48,898 --> 01:36:51,423
Yes, just a second.

1644
01:37:04,146 --> 01:37:05,636
What are you doing here?

1645
01:37:05,981 --> 01:37:07,448
I heard you were sick...

1646
01:37:07,817 --> 01:37:09,375
...and I was worried.

1647
01:37:10,886 --> 01:37:11,944
And I wanted...

1648
01:37:12,154 --> 01:37:12,984
...to make--

1649
01:37:15,491 --> 01:37:17,220
Is there somebody here?

1650
01:37:18,494 --> 01:37:20,394
It's the Home Shopping Network.

1651
01:37:20,596 --> 01:37:22,928
You buy any of those
little porcelain dolls?

1652
01:37:23,132 --> 01:37:24,895
I was thinking about it.

1653
01:37:25,634 --> 01:37:27,067
You put me out of business.

1654
01:37:27,269 --> 01:37:28,201
Yes, I did.

1655
01:37:28,404 --> 01:37:29,837
Did you come to gloat?

1656
01:37:30,039 --> 01:37:31,063
To offer me a job?

1657
01:37:31,273 --> 01:37:32,205
I would never--

1658
01:37:32,408 --> 01:37:33,898
I have plans.
I have plenty of offers.

1659
01:37:34,110 --> 01:37:35,737
You know, I got offered a job by--

1660
01:37:35,978 --> 01:37:36,910
By my former....

1661
01:37:37,113 --> 01:37:38,080
Your former?

1662
01:37:39,081 --> 01:37:39,979
We broke up.

1663
01:37:40,182 --> 01:37:42,548
That's too bad. You were
so perfect for each other.

1664
01:37:46,755 --> 01:37:48,188
I don't mean to say things like that.

1665
01:37:48,424 --> 01:37:49,721
No matter what you've done...

1666
01:37:49,925 --> 01:37:52,052
...there's no excuse for my
saying anything like that.

1667
01:37:52,261 --> 01:37:53,489
But every time I see you--

1668
01:37:53,696 --> 01:37:56,028
Things like that just
fly out of your mouth.

1669
01:37:58,434 --> 01:37:59,696
I brought you flowers.

1670
01:38:03,672 --> 01:38:04,502
Thank you.

1671
01:38:09,945 --> 01:38:12,209
Why don't I just
put these in some water?

1672
01:38:13,682 --> 01:38:14,512
You're sick.

1673
01:38:14,717 --> 01:38:15,547
You should sit down.

1674
01:38:21,457 --> 01:38:22,890
I need a vase?

1675
01:38:23,826 --> 01:38:25,851
Above the refrigerator.

1676
01:38:26,295 --> 01:38:28,786
There it is. Obviously.

1677
01:38:29,965 --> 01:38:32,661
George says hello, by the way.

1678
01:38:34,403 --> 01:38:35,961
He told me you were sick.

1679
01:38:36,305 --> 01:38:37,203
How is George?

1680
01:38:39,074 --> 01:38:41,133
He's great, really great.

1681
01:38:41,343 --> 01:38:43,402
He's revolutionizing the place.

1682
01:38:44,213 --> 01:38:45,612
You can't work in his department...

1683
01:38:45,814 --> 01:38:47,406
...unless you have a Ph.D.
in Children's Literature.

1684
01:38:48,651 --> 01:38:50,278
I love daisies.

1685
01:38:51,554 --> 01:38:52,384
You told me.

1686
01:38:52,588 --> 01:38:54,021
They're so friendly.

1687
01:38:54,223 --> 01:38:56,555
Don't you think daisies
are the friendliest flower?

1688
01:38:57,826 --> 01:38:58,815
I do.

1689
01:38:59,929 --> 01:39:01,089
When did you break up?

1690
01:39:02,431 --> 01:39:03,659
Couple of weeks ago.

1691
01:39:04,366 --> 01:39:06,994
Everyone is breaking up. You. Me.

1692
01:39:07,203 --> 01:39:09,865
This other person I know broke up
with someone in an elevator...

1693
01:39:10,105 --> 01:39:13,871
...or after it,
or just outside it, or....

1694
01:39:14,109 --> 01:39:15,838
It got stuck....

1695
01:39:16,345 --> 01:39:19,781
When I saw you at the coffee place,
I was waiting for him.

1696
01:39:20,015 --> 01:39:21,175
And I was....

1697
01:39:21,450 --> 01:39:22,781
Charming.

1698
01:39:23,219 --> 01:39:24,652
I was not charming.

1699
01:39:24,853 --> 01:39:26,844
Well, you looked charming. Tea?

1700
01:39:27,056 --> 01:39:28,114
Yes.

1701
01:39:28,757 --> 01:39:31,191
I was upset and horrible.

1702
01:39:32,027 --> 01:39:33,289
Honey?

1703
01:39:33,963 --> 01:39:35,260
I was the horrible one.

1704
01:39:35,464 --> 01:39:37,022
Well, that's true.

1705
01:39:37,233 --> 01:39:39,030
But I have no excuse.

1706
01:39:40,536 --> 01:39:42,527
I see what you're saying.

1707
01:39:43,472 --> 01:39:44,666
That's interesting.

1708
01:39:44,873 --> 01:39:47,034
Whereas I am a horrible person...

1709
01:39:47,243 --> 01:39:50,440
...therefore I have no choice
but to be horrible.

1710
01:39:50,646 --> 01:39:51,670
That's what you're saying.

1711
01:39:53,315 --> 01:39:54,145
But that's all right.

1712
01:39:54,383 --> 01:39:56,908
That's all right. I put you
out of business, so...

1713
01:39:57,586 --> 01:39:59,178
...you're entitled to hate me.

1714
01:40:00,656 --> 01:40:01,486
I don't hate you.

1715
01:40:03,092 --> 01:40:04,992
But you'll never forgive me.

1716
01:40:05,728 --> 01:40:06,592
Just like Elizabeth.

1717
01:40:07,096 --> 01:40:07,926
Who?

1718
01:40:08,597 --> 01:40:09,495
Elizabeth Bennet...

1719
01:40:09,698 --> 01:40:12,895
...in Pride and Prejudice.
She was too proud.

1720
01:40:13,269 --> 01:40:14,736
I thought you hated
Pride and Prejudice.

1721
01:40:14,937 --> 01:40:17,497
Or was she too prejudiced...

1722
01:40:17,740 --> 01:40:20,208
...and Mr. Darcy is too proud?

1723
01:40:20,442 --> 01:40:21,807
Well, I can't remember.

1724
01:40:28,083 --> 01:40:29,948
It wasn't personal.

1725
01:40:30,286 --> 01:40:33,585
What is that supposed to mean?
I'm so sick of that.

1726
01:40:33,822 --> 01:40:37,258
All that means
is that it wasn't personal to you.

1727
01:40:37,459 --> 01:40:39,120
But it was personal to me.

1728
01:40:39,328 --> 01:40:41,592
It's personal to a lot of people.

1729
01:40:41,797 --> 01:40:43,594
What is so wrong with being personal?

1730
01:40:46,135 --> 01:40:47,534
Nothing.

1731
01:40:47,770 --> 01:40:50,933
Whatever else anything is,
it ought to begin by being personal.

1732
01:40:55,144 --> 01:40:57,612
My head is starting to get fuzzy.

1733
01:41:02,951 --> 01:41:04,885
Why did you stop by again?
I forget.

1734
01:41:06,455 --> 01:41:07,752
I wanted to be your friend.

1735
01:41:11,126 --> 01:41:13,219
I knew it wasn't possible.

1736
01:41:14,296 --> 01:41:17,459
What can I say? Sometimes a guy
just wants the impossible.

1737
01:41:27,309 --> 01:41:29,243
Can I ask you a question?

1738
01:41:29,545 --> 01:41:30,705
What?

1739
01:41:32,514 --> 01:41:35,176
What happened with that guy
at the caf?

1740
01:41:36,051 --> 01:41:37,211
Nothing.

1741
01:41:37,419 --> 01:41:39,216
But you're crazy about him?

1742
01:41:40,656 --> 01:41:41,645
Yes, I am.

1743
01:41:41,857 --> 01:41:44,826
Why don't you run off with him?
What are you waiting for?

1744
01:41:47,663 --> 01:41:49,528
I don't actually know him.

1745
01:41:50,432 --> 01:41:51,262
Really?

1746
01:41:53,836 --> 01:41:55,360
I only know him through the....

1747
01:41:57,373 --> 01:41:58,738
You're not going to believe this.

1748
01:41:58,941 --> 01:42:00,670
Let me guess.

1749
01:42:01,176 --> 01:42:02,541
Through the lnternet?

1750
01:42:03,846 --> 01:42:04,676
Yes.

1751
01:42:08,717 --> 01:42:09,706
"You've...

1752
01:42:10,185 --> 01:42:11,277
...got mail."

1753
01:42:15,124 --> 01:42:16,648
Those are very powerful words.

1754
01:42:21,730 --> 01:42:22,890
I'm happy for him.

1755
01:42:24,967 --> 01:42:26,628
Although....

1756
01:42:27,903 --> 01:42:29,962
Could I just make a little suggestion?

1757
01:42:30,572 --> 01:42:31,732
What?

1758
01:42:32,274 --> 01:42:33,468
I think...

1759
01:42:34,309 --> 01:42:36,038
...you should meet him.

1760
01:42:36,445 --> 01:42:38,208
No, wait, I take that back.

1761
01:42:39,915 --> 01:42:41,906
Why would you want to meet
somebody you're crazy about?

1762
01:42:43,051 --> 01:42:46,418
I hardly think I need to take
advice from a person who--

1763
01:42:48,957 --> 01:42:51,357
Now I can see that I
bring out the worst in you.

1764
01:42:51,593 --> 01:42:54,221
But let me just help
you to not say something...

1765
01:42:54,430 --> 01:42:56,398
...you're just going to
torture yourself about...

1766
01:42:56,598 --> 01:42:58,930
...for years to come.

1767
01:43:11,947 --> 01:43:13,812
I hope you feel better soon.

1768
01:43:15,617 --> 01:43:17,949
It would be a shame to miss
New York in the spring.

1769
01:43:22,124 --> 01:43:23,751
Thank you for the daisies.

1770
01:43:34,770 --> 01:43:35,759
Well...

1771
01:43:35,971 --> 01:43:37,438
...you take care.

1772
01:43:38,874 --> 01:43:39,932
I will.

1773
01:43:41,376 --> 01:43:42,240
Goodbye.

1774
01:43:44,146 --> 01:43:45,511
Goodbye.

1775
01:44:02,464 --> 01:44:04,489
I've been thinking about this...

1776
01:44:04,867 --> 01:44:06,835
...and I think we should meet.

1777
01:44:13,709 --> 01:44:15,336
We should meet.

1778
01:44:15,978 --> 01:44:17,741
And we will meet.

1779
01:44:18,313 --> 01:44:22,181
But I'm in the middle
of a project that needs...

1780
01:44:27,489 --> 01:44:29,013
...tweaking.

1781
01:44:48,877 --> 01:44:50,401
Some tweaking?

1782
01:44:50,946 --> 01:44:52,937
A project that needed...

1783
01:44:53,215 --> 01:44:54,182
..."tweaking."

1784
01:44:54,383 --> 01:44:57,250
-Yeah, that's what he said.
-T-W-E-A-k-l-N-G?

1785
01:44:57,452 --> 01:44:58,578
-Tweaking.
-That's what he said.

1786
01:44:59,288 --> 01:45:02,223
It sounds to me like he's married...

1787
01:45:02,591 --> 01:45:03,558
...3 kids.

1788
01:45:03,759 --> 01:45:05,124
That's a terrible thing to say.

1789
01:45:05,327 --> 01:45:06,589
He couldn't possibly be married.

1790
01:45:06,795 --> 01:45:08,194
How do you know?

1791
01:45:08,397 --> 01:45:10,695
Have you said, "Are you married?"
Have you written to him?

1792
01:45:10,899 --> 01:45:13,424
No, I'm not going to-- No.

1793
01:45:14,803 --> 01:45:18,295
I know this is probably
a little late to be asking, but...

1794
01:45:19,374 --> 01:45:20,807
...are you married?

1795
01:45:24,379 --> 01:45:25,778
Am I married?

1796
01:45:25,981 --> 01:45:28,040
What kind of question is that?

1797
01:45:28,584 --> 01:45:30,142
How can you ask me that?

1798
01:45:30,385 --> 01:45:31,511
Don't you know me at all?

1799
01:45:31,753 --> 01:45:33,653
Wait, I get it.

1800
01:45:34,289 --> 01:45:36,655
Your friends are telling you
the reason we haven't met...

1801
01:45:36,892 --> 01:45:38,985
...is that I'm married.
Am I right?

1802
01:45:40,529 --> 01:45:41,689
So he didn't answer the question.

1803
01:45:41,897 --> 01:45:42,829
Yes, he did.

1804
01:45:43,031 --> 01:45:43,963
-He did not.
-He did too.

1805
01:45:44,199 --> 01:45:45,996
He did. He nailed me.

1806
01:45:46,201 --> 01:45:47,793
He knew exactly what I was after...

1807
01:45:48,036 --> 01:45:50,163
...which is, by the way,
exactly like him.

1808
01:45:50,372 --> 01:45:52,101
He did not answer the question,
did he?

1809
01:45:54,443 --> 01:45:55,239
No.

1810
01:45:57,446 --> 01:45:59,004
Maybe he's fat.

1811
01:46:00,382 --> 01:46:02,282
He's fat. He's a fatty.

1812
01:46:02,618 --> 01:46:03,778
I don't care about that.

1813
01:46:03,986 --> 01:46:05,851
You don't care that he's so fat...

1814
01:46:06,054 --> 01:46:09,046
...he has to be removed
from his house by a crane.

1815
01:46:09,291 --> 01:46:10,121
You don't care.

1816
01:46:10,325 --> 01:46:11,758
That is very unlikely.

1817
01:46:11,994 --> 01:46:14,326
That is completely ridiculous.

1818
01:46:14,896 --> 01:46:15,920
So what's his handle?

1819
01:46:19,835 --> 01:46:21,598
I'm not going to write him.

1820
01:46:21,837 --> 01:46:23,737
You think I'm going to e-mail him?

1821
01:46:26,141 --> 01:46:27,335
All right, N-Y-1 -5-2.

1822
01:46:28,010 --> 01:46:30,740
N-Y-1 -5-2? 1 52.

1823
01:46:30,946 --> 01:46:33,039
He's 1 52 years old.

1824
01:46:33,782 --> 01:46:36,580
He's had 1 52 moles removed...

1825
01:46:36,785 --> 01:46:39,754
...so now he's got
1 52 pockmarks on his...

1826
01:46:40,422 --> 01:46:42,014
...on his face.

1827
01:46:42,324 --> 01:46:43,689
The number of people...

1828
01:46:43,925 --> 01:46:45,722
...who think he looks like Clark Gable.

1829
01:46:46,028 --> 01:46:49,896
1 52 people who think
he looks like a Clark Bar.

1830
01:46:53,769 --> 01:46:57,330
-Why'd I tell you about this?
-1 52 stitches from his nose job.

1831
01:46:57,539 --> 01:47:00,667
The number of his souvenir
shot glasses...

1832
01:47:00,876 --> 01:47:02,207
...that he's collected...

1833
01:47:02,444 --> 01:47:04,378
...in his travels.

1834
01:47:05,347 --> 01:47:06,473
His address.

1835
01:47:07,149 --> 01:47:10,607
No, he would never
do anything that prosaic.

1836
01:47:14,956 --> 01:47:17,789
The only thing I
really care about is that...

1837
01:47:18,160 --> 01:47:20,685
...aside from the married thing
and the jail thing...

1838
01:47:20,896 --> 01:47:21,726
Of course.

1839
01:47:22,531 --> 01:47:24,192
...is the boat thing.

1840
01:47:24,800 --> 01:47:25,789
What boat thing?

1841
01:47:26,001 --> 01:47:28,299
I could never be with someone
who had a boat.

1842
01:47:30,138 --> 01:47:31,537
I have a boat.

1843
01:47:34,142 --> 01:47:36,838
Which clinches it.
We'll never be together.

1844
01:47:37,045 --> 01:47:38,808
-How many?
-Three.

1845
01:47:39,014 --> 01:47:40,276
-Allow me.
-Thank you.

1846
01:47:40,482 --> 01:47:43,747
I could never be with
someone who likes Joni Mitchell.

1847
01:47:44,386 --> 01:47:45,683
"It's cloud's illusions I recall.

1848
01:47:45,887 --> 01:47:47,149
I really don't know clouds at all."

1849
01:47:47,355 --> 01:47:48,754
What does that mean?

1850
01:47:48,990 --> 01:47:51,117
Is she a pilot?
ls she taking flying lessons?

1851
01:47:51,326 --> 01:47:54,261
It must be a metaphor for something,
but I don't know what it is.

1852
01:47:55,897 --> 01:47:57,364
So how's your book coming?

1853
01:47:57,566 --> 01:48:00,433
There's this children's book editor
I know from the store...

1854
01:48:00,669 --> 01:48:03,160
...and she's excited to read it
when I'm finished.

1855
01:48:03,572 --> 01:48:05,870
Who would ever have thought
that I would write?

1856
01:48:06,074 --> 01:48:08,440
If I hadn't had all this time....

1857
01:48:09,344 --> 01:48:10,538
-You know what?
-What?

1858
01:48:11,213 --> 01:48:15,445
The truth is that he was the one who
started me thinking about writing.

1859
01:48:16,418 --> 01:48:19,012
Mr. 1 52 Felony lndictments.

1860
01:48:20,856 --> 01:48:23,950
Mr. 1 52 lnsights lnto My Soul.

1861
01:48:26,962 --> 01:48:28,520
No competing with that.

1862
01:48:31,767 --> 01:48:33,735
I keep on bumping into you.

1863
01:48:35,704 --> 01:48:37,069
Hope your mango's ripe.

1864
01:48:37,873 --> 01:48:39,534
I think it is.

1865
01:48:40,142 --> 01:48:42,269
You want to bump into me on...

1866
01:48:42,611 --> 01:48:44,875
...Saturday around lunchtime?

1867
01:48:45,147 --> 01:48:45,977
Over there?

1868
01:48:53,288 --> 01:48:55,415
How about meeting...

1869
01:48:55,824 --> 01:48:57,917
...Saturday?

1870
01:48:58,627 --> 01:49:00,618
Four o'clock?

1871
01:49:00,929 --> 01:49:03,022
There's a place in Riverside Park
at 91st Street...

1872
01:49:03,231 --> 01:49:06,200
...where the path curves
and there's a garden.

1873
01:49:06,401 --> 01:49:08,767
Brinkley and I will be waiting.

1874
01:49:09,471 --> 01:49:10,768
Okay, come on, let's do it.

1875
01:49:10,972 --> 01:49:12,633
Ready? And...

1876
01:49:12,841 --> 01:49:13,933
...doop.

1877
01:49:14,409 --> 01:49:15,706
There it goes.

1878
01:49:16,578 --> 01:49:18,011
Today?

1879
01:49:19,748 --> 01:49:22,308
I know. In Riverside Park.

1880
01:49:23,685 --> 01:49:25,676
That would mean he's a West Sider.

1881
01:49:25,921 --> 01:49:26,888
Isn't that amazing?

1882
01:49:27,088 --> 01:49:28,680
Maybe I've seen him
and don't even know it.

1883
01:49:28,924 --> 01:49:31,085
You could have seen him
every day and not know it.

1884
01:49:31,293 --> 01:49:32,624
-It's very possible.
-He could be anybody.

1885
01:49:32,828 --> 01:49:34,625
-He could be anyone.
-He could be that guy right there.

1886
01:49:34,830 --> 01:49:36,957
And those flowers are for you.

1887
01:49:38,533 --> 01:49:39,864
Could be the Zipper Man.

1888
01:49:40,101 --> 01:49:41,090
Who's that?

1889
01:49:41,303 --> 01:49:42,565
The Zipper Man.

1890
01:49:42,771 --> 01:49:43,999
Who is that?

1891
01:49:44,773 --> 01:49:46,468
He repairs zippers on Amsterdam Avenue.

1892
01:49:46,675 --> 01:49:47,539
Will you cut it out?

1893
01:49:47,776 --> 01:49:48,743
You'd never have to buy new luggage.

1894
01:49:48,944 --> 01:49:50,172
Cut it out.

1895
01:49:51,947 --> 01:49:53,847
The timing here is everything.

1896
01:49:54,049 --> 01:49:55,846
He's waited until you're primed.

1897
01:49:56,051 --> 01:49:56,949
See?

1898
01:49:57,152 --> 01:49:59,143
Until you are absolutely convinced...

1899
01:49:59,354 --> 01:50:01,845
...that there's no other man...

1900
01:50:02,057 --> 01:50:04,355
...that you could possibly love.

1901
01:50:04,559 --> 01:50:05,548
Yes.

1902
01:50:06,628 --> 01:50:08,459
You know, sometimes I wonder.

1903
01:50:08,797 --> 01:50:09,627
What?

1904
01:50:09,831 --> 01:50:10,798
Well...

1905
01:50:13,301 --> 01:50:16,168
...if I hadn't been Fox Books
and you hadn't been...

1906
01:50:16,371 --> 01:50:18,635
...The Shop Around The Corner...

1907
01:50:19,241 --> 01:50:21,766
...and you and I had just,
you know, met.

1908
01:50:22,310 --> 01:50:23,607
I know.

1909
01:50:25,881 --> 01:50:27,143
I'd have asked for your number.

1910
01:50:29,851 --> 01:50:31,284
I wouldn't have been able to wait...

1911
01:50:31,486 --> 01:50:34,387
...24 hours before calling
and saying:

1912
01:50:36,591 --> 01:50:38,718
"How about some coffee or...

1913
01:50:38,927 --> 01:50:41,259
...you know, drinks or dinner...

1914
01:50:41,496 --> 01:50:42,986
...or a movie...

1915
01:50:44,099 --> 01:50:46,624
...for as long as we both shall live."

1916
01:50:52,173 --> 01:50:53,697
You and I would never have been at war.

1917
01:50:55,677 --> 01:50:57,474
The only thing we'd fight about
would be...

1918
01:50:57,679 --> 01:51:00,170
...which video to rent
on a Saturday night.

1919
01:51:03,418 --> 01:51:04,817
Who fights about that?

1920
01:51:06,354 --> 01:51:07,514
Some people.

1921
01:51:08,957 --> 01:51:09,946
Not us.

1922
01:51:10,191 --> 01:51:11,783
We would never.

1923
01:51:16,531 --> 01:51:17,862
If only.

1924
01:51:23,204 --> 01:51:24,034
I got to go.

1925
01:51:24,239 --> 01:51:26,264
Let me ask you something.

1926
01:51:31,079 --> 01:51:33,639
How can you forgive this guy
for standing you up...

1927
01:51:35,050 --> 01:51:38,281
...and not forgive me for this
tiny little thing...

1928
01:51:39,421 --> 01:51:41,013
...of putting you out of business?

1929
01:51:47,128 --> 01:51:48,595
How I wish you would.

1930
01:51:51,232 --> 01:51:52,824
I really have to go.

1931
01:51:53,301 --> 01:51:54,859
You don't want to be late.

1932
01:54:09,604 --> 01:54:11,970
Don't cry, Shopgirl.

1933
01:54:13,541 --> 01:54:14,701
Don't cry.

1934
01:54:18,379 --> 01:54:19,971
I wanted it to be you.

1935
01:54:22,150 --> 01:54:24,482
I wanted it to be you so badly.
