1
00:03:12,880 --> 00:03:14,120
Raised the body higher,

2
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:15,242
so that they can see it.

3
00:03:38,680 --> 00:03:40,170
Lu Shenkang.

4
00:03:40,760 --> 00:03:41,602
This sword equate military command.

5
00:03:42,680 --> 00:03:45,251
As long as the Prince's in 
our hand, we'll not lose.

6
00:03:45,840 --> 00:03:47,080
Grasp hold of it.

7
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:01,329
Freeze! Freeze!

8
00:07:01,640 --> 00:07:02,527
After him!

9
00:07:36,760 --> 00:07:38,762
Go on! Kill him.

10
00:07:41,720 --> 00:07:43,006
Go on!

11
00:07:45,840 --> 00:07:46,841
Or he'll kill you.

12
00:08:08,880 --> 00:08:10,689
There's only one option 
in the battlefield,

13
00:08:12,840 --> 00:08:15,286
killed or be killed.

14
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:11,489
Hold still!

15
00:10:19,080 --> 00:10:21,970
You're brave, not afraid of dying.

16
00:10:22,800 --> 00:10:23,722
Thanks...

17
00:10:25,480 --> 00:10:29,201
I want to give it all away.

18
00:10:31,040 --> 00:10:34,089
You're both shrewd and cunning,

19
00:10:34,440 --> 00:10:36,408
it's rare.

20
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,443
Where did the wolf came from?

21
00:11:20,600 --> 00:11:21,408
Found it.

22
00:11:29,320 --> 00:11:32,290
Just let it loose.

23
00:11:35,000 --> 00:11:36,331
I let it loose but it came back.

24
00:11:39,080 --> 00:11:40,445
Followed me then.

25
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:46,441
But I don't know about warfare.

26
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,241
What warfare?

27
00:11:50,360 --> 00:11:52,567
It's going to snow soon.

28
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:57,562
After it snow, we can go back.

29
00:12:08,480 --> 00:12:09,891
I don't have a home to return to.

30
00:12:11,040 --> 00:12:13,771
I only know how to tend sheep 
and this is a good place.

31
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:44,010
C'mon...killed me!

32
00:16:48,320 --> 00:16:49,526
I'm not gonna kill you.

33
00:16:50,280 --> 00:16:52,248
You think you can still be freed?

34
00:16:52,760 --> 00:16:54,000
I'll be honest with you,

35
00:16:55,120 --> 00:16:56,531
not one person managed 
to leave here before.

36
00:17:31,560 --> 00:17:35,485
Ever drank urine before?

37
00:17:37,760 --> 00:17:42,687
A decade ago when  I was lost, 
I drank before.

38
00:17:48,040 --> 00:17:49,610
Just like a beast.

39
00:17:55,000 --> 00:17:58,607
A beast will only harm 
someone for self presevation.

40
00:18:00,560 --> 00:18:01,561
Kill you?

41
00:18:03,160 --> 00:18:03,922
I am not a beast.

42
00:19:55,920 --> 00:19:57,604
Stop! Release the hostage.

43
00:21:10,800 --> 00:21:12,370
You exchanged me,

44
00:21:14,200 --> 00:21:14,849
you beast.

45
00:21:16,760 --> 00:21:17,363
Give me my sword.

46
00:21:22,760 --> 00:21:23,886
We can't release the Prince.

47
00:21:24,800 --> 00:21:25,881
Foolish!

48
00:22:08,440 --> 00:22:09,487
How many killed?

49
00:22:25,440 --> 00:22:27,602
You'll not be afraid of blood 
after spilling too much of it.

50
00:22:36,320 --> 00:22:37,845
You still wanna kill?

51
00:22:48,240 --> 00:22:49,321
We lost so pathetically.

52
00:22:51,520 --> 00:22:52,521
It deserved dead.

53
00:22:57,400 --> 00:23:01,883
It snow at this time every year.

54
00:23:05,160 --> 00:23:06,127
Heavy snow fall.

55
00:23:08,440 --> 00:23:09,202
Stop fighting...

56
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:12,407
Going home.

57
00:23:17,160 --> 00:23:18,969
More than a decade...

58
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,727
More than a decade...

59
00:23:23,320 --> 00:23:24,367
We lost so pathetically.

60
00:23:27,160 --> 00:23:29,686
Take my head back as atonement.

61
00:23:31,160 --> 00:23:34,403
Returning meant death to 
our troops too.

62
00:23:37,760 --> 00:23:39,364
Kill me...you beast.

63
00:23:41,280 --> 00:23:42,361
Go on!

64
00:23:42,680 --> 00:23:44,444
Go on!!!

65
00:23:45,200 --> 00:23:46,531
Do it!

66
00:23:49,360 --> 00:23:52,204
Do it...you beast.

67
00:25:57,480 --> 00:25:58,288
C'mon.

68
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:06,081
It's either you or me that'll be killed.

69
00:26:14,400 --> 00:26:15,367
I will not died.

70
00:26:16,360 --> 00:26:17,850
I have swords, spears and troops.

71
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,162
When the sun arises,

72
00:26:29,040 --> 00:26:30,326
there'll be no one to collect 
your bodies.

73
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,966
C'mon...you beast!

74
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:35,487
Come out.

75
00:34:45,000 --> 00:34:46,240
Who are you?

76
00:34:50,600 --> 00:34:51,886
Dead person.

77
00:34:53,800 --> 00:34:55,131
Why are you in hiding?

78
00:34:56,120 --> 00:34:56,723
I'm not hiding.

79
00:34:57,800 --> 00:34:58,881
This is my home.

80
00:35:00,080 --> 00:35:02,401
I have no dealing with a dead person.

81
00:35:03,440 --> 00:35:04,601
Go back to your own place.

82
00:35:10,880 --> 00:35:12,166
What are you trying to do?

83
00:35:12,560 --> 00:35:13,686
I don't want to stay together 
with a man.

84
00:35:17,440 --> 00:35:18,726
I'm releasing you.

85
00:35:19,280 --> 00:35:20,406
Crawled back to your own place.

86
00:35:21,680 --> 00:35:24,604
You're the one who need to 
crawl back. Get out!

87
00:35:24,640 --> 00:35:25,721
Go back to your own place.

88
00:37:00,560 --> 00:37:02,403
Get up! Get up!

89
00:37:04,160 --> 00:37:04,888
Faster!

90
00:37:42,400 --> 00:37:43,083
Put it down and don't move.

91
00:37:44,440 --> 00:37:45,248
It's already cold.

92
00:37:46,120 --> 00:37:47,087
Just put it down.

93
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,123
Hey--

94
00:41:47,560 --> 00:41:49,244
The Harran tribe just got into a fight.

95
00:41:49,640 --> 00:41:51,847
Someone was hurt.
The soup is not ready yet.

96
00:41:52,200 --> 00:41:53,042
It's okay.

97
00:41:54,280 --> 00:41:56,442
A wolf came into the village last night.

98
00:41:57,320 --> 00:41:58,526
There's evil in the village.

99
00:42:00,080 --> 00:42:00,842
Go on!

100
00:42:08,360 --> 00:42:10,522
Kata! Kata!

101
00:42:11,080 --> 00:42:12,525
Kata! It's Kata!

102
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:14,604
Let me go! Let go!

103
00:42:25,440 --> 00:42:26,771
I will kill you if you 
continued screaming.

104
00:42:27,160 --> 00:42:29,049
Kill me...you beast.

105
00:42:30,120 --> 00:42:32,885
I will kill you if you dare to go out.

106
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:09,003
Smile!

107
00:43:09,920 --> 00:43:11,160
Show me a smile.

108
00:43:16,680 --> 00:43:19,843
Death or alive, it will not 
come to a good ending.

109
00:43:20,400 --> 00:43:22,402
Taking care of a dead person,

110
00:43:22,960 --> 00:43:24,246
why not a beast.

111
00:43:46,680 --> 00:43:48,409
Eat it!

112
00:44:19,000 --> 00:44:20,729
I too am a dead person.

113
00:44:23,400 --> 00:44:24,128
Losing the war,

114
00:44:25,280 --> 00:44:26,805
I will be sentence to death 
when I return home.

115
00:44:28,440 --> 00:44:31,364
A dead person fear nothing.

116
00:44:32,840 --> 00:44:34,171
Don't give me anymore trouble.

117
00:44:36,800 --> 00:44:38,404
I don't want to kill anymore.

118
00:45:31,840 --> 00:45:33,490
You fear someone will see you.

119
00:45:35,120 --> 00:45:36,849
It's humiliating.

120
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:40,082
If someone sees it,

121
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:42,561
I will kill him.

122
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:48,088
Me too...it's humiliating.

123
00:45:50,720 --> 00:45:53,769
Let me tell you, if a Harran were 
to have sex with an outsider,

124
00:45:54,040 --> 00:45:55,405
then the alternative would be death.

125
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:00,524
You're not a dead person.

126
00:46:00,920 --> 00:46:02,968
Would the dead felt humiliated?

127
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,611
Do you think you're better off?

128
00:46:08,800 --> 00:46:10,643
My deeds are unforgiveable.

129
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:15,330
Kill me or leave me alone.

130
00:47:03,800 --> 00:47:06,121
Come out! Come on out!

131
00:47:28,200 --> 00:47:28,849
Kata!

132
00:47:36,040 --> 00:47:37,724
Kata! Kata!

133
00:47:52,800 --> 00:47:55,406
I beg you to save me, sister.

134
00:47:55,440 --> 00:47:57,841
He had been cursed.

135
00:47:57,880 --> 00:47:59,882
The tribe's are gonna 
burn him to death.

136
00:49:03,080 --> 00:49:04,241
Let him go.

137
00:51:17,920 --> 00:51:18,682
Wait!

138
00:51:22,280 --> 00:51:23,520
The snowing stopped?!

139
00:51:24,560 --> 00:51:25,209
It's stopping soon.

140
00:51:25,760 --> 00:51:26,682
Relay my order,

141
00:51:27,840 --> 00:51:29,001
we moved out tomorrow morning.

142
00:51:29,560 --> 00:51:31,608
Order relayed...we moved 
out tomorrow morning.

143
00:51:58,560 --> 00:52:01,723
Come out!

144
00:52:21,880 --> 00:52:22,847
Come out--

145
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,565
What do you think you're doing?

146
00:54:12,920 --> 00:54:15,685
Let me be! Let go!
Can't I just die?

147
00:54:18,400 --> 00:54:20,801
Go home! Follow me home.

148
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:25,563
I don't have a home.

149
00:55:46,240 --> 00:55:46,809
Bite it.

150
00:57:51,320 --> 00:57:53,288
We will come to an agreement tonight.

151
00:58:03,640 --> 00:58:05,085
You'll be leaving tomorrow.

152
00:58:10,920 --> 00:58:12,206
You don't need to remind me.

153
00:58:15,160 --> 00:58:17,606
I have already given the 
order this morning.

154
00:58:20,120 --> 00:58:21,087
The snowing stopped.

155
00:58:23,160 --> 00:58:25,640
There're no more obstacles 
preventing the troops movement.

156
00:58:26,840 --> 00:58:27,648
Snow--

157
00:58:29,320 --> 00:58:31,163
if I want you to remain,

158
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,848
but I can't!

159
00:58:48,720 --> 00:58:52,770
I can't bear seeing you 
becoming a beast.

160
00:58:56,400 --> 00:58:57,765
Beast?!

161
00:59:00,160 --> 00:59:01,571
Harran tribe folks are cursed!

162
00:59:03,000 --> 00:59:06,402
If we were to have sex  
with outsider,

163
00:59:06,840 --> 00:59:08,524
we'll turn into a beast.

164
00:59:11,040 --> 00:59:13,520
Kata in fact is my aunty daughter.

165
00:59:14,040 --> 00:59:15,371
She came back to see her mother.

166
00:59:16,360 --> 00:59:18,362
That's unbelievable.

167
00:59:22,200 --> 00:59:23,964
Why should I lie to you?

168
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:31,648
What curse is that?

169
00:59:32,920 --> 00:59:34,809
What kind of beast will 
we be transformed into?

170
00:59:37,600 --> 00:59:38,123
Wolf!

171
00:59:41,000 --> 00:59:42,206
Only wolf behaved as such.

172
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:48,049
No matter who bumped into 
them when they're having sex,

173
00:59:48,480 --> 00:59:52,769
it'll tracked them down 
due to humiliation...

174
00:59:52,800 --> 00:59:54,962
and bite the other's to death.

175
01:00:00,400 --> 01:00:02,323
You mean we will turn into wolves?

176
01:00:06,760 --> 01:00:07,727
That's not a bad thing actually.

177
01:00:11,560 --> 01:00:13,483
Besides wolf what else 
could it be?

178
01:00:16,880 --> 01:00:18,769
We are already heartless.

179
01:06:08,760 --> 01:06:09,966
You are back!

180
01:06:31,640 --> 01:06:33,369
I have been longing for you.

181
01:06:45,440 --> 01:06:47,124
You have finally return.

182
01:07:11,200 --> 01:07:14,204
For the longing of a husband,
I've been a dead person.

183
01:07:16,800 --> 01:07:18,006
Since it's fated--

184
01:07:19,600 --> 01:07:21,568
I lived only just for you.

185
01:07:27,920 --> 01:07:32,005
Transforming into a beast and 
I'll still just survive only for you.

186
01:08:07,960 --> 01:08:10,566
Since when have we became such?

187
01:08:14,240 --> 01:08:15,969
We'll only know when 
we awoke at night.

188
01:08:17,160 --> 01:08:18,969
I was afraid at that time.

189
01:08:22,920 --> 01:08:23,967
You're here.

190
01:08:25,640 --> 01:08:27,608
My heart felt comforted.

191
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:07,961
Lord Zhang..

192
01:10:08,360 --> 01:10:10,328
They're just bandits.
They don't know our identities

193
01:10:13,960 --> 01:10:16,884
Just let them go.

194
01:10:18,760 --> 01:10:21,366
Tell our troops to be careful.

195
01:10:22,200 --> 01:10:24,487
Maintain no contact with 
other people along the way.

196
01:10:26,720 --> 01:10:28,768
I just want to debrief in peace.

197
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:33,927
Let's go!

198
01:10:34,240 --> 01:10:35,241
Yes!

199
01:11:31,080 --> 01:11:32,923
Hey...don't just simply shoot.

200
01:11:36,280 --> 01:11:37,281
What do you mean,  can't shoot?

201
01:11:43,640 --> 01:11:44,482
Just let it be.

202
01:12:08,480 --> 01:12:10,084
Get up quick, faster!

203
01:12:12,120 --> 01:12:13,281
What's up?

204
01:14:45,320 --> 01:14:45,969
You found it?

205
01:14:46,160 --> 01:14:46,729
No!

206
01:14:46,960 --> 01:14:48,166
- Go and search for it!
- Yes!

207
01:15:17,680 --> 01:15:18,488
Sold it!?

208
01:15:22,880 --> 01:15:24,245
Thrown the cursed object away.

209
01:15:24,680 --> 01:15:26,682
Get on the horses and 
leaves the wolves behind.

210
01:15:27,080 --> 01:15:28,127
Yes!

211
01:19:16,080 --> 01:19:19,004
You take some troops and 
lead the wolves away.

212
01:19:20,960 --> 01:19:24,009
You must delivered the 
edict no matter what.

213
01:20:11,480 --> 01:20:12,811
Take care!

214
01:20:59,520 --> 01:21:03,286
Take a break and  feed the horses.

215
01:21:04,440 --> 01:21:05,248
We must hurry on our way.

216
01:21:05,640 --> 01:21:06,766
Yes!
