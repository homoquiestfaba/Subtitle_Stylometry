00:00:22,522 --> 00:00:24,820
(Narrator)
In the spring of 2005,

2
00:00:24,891 --> 00:00:27,587
a young graduate
film student from UCLA

3
00:00:27,660 --> 00:00:29,855
set forth to make
a documentary

4
00:00:29,929 --> 00:00:32,454
reflecting an element
of contemporary music culture

5
00:00:32,532 --> 00:00:34,466
that had yet to be
fully examined.

6
00:00:34,534 --> 00:00:35,592
(crowd cheering)

7
00:00:51,918 --> 00:00:55,547
The notion was to capture
something raw and original,

8
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:58,284
something unpretentious
and genuine.

9
00:00:58,358 --> 00:01:00,053
(jam)

10
00:01:00,126 --> 00:01:02,526
He yearned to make a film
that would stand out

11
00:01:02,595 --> 00:01:04,620
from other rock 'n' roll
documentaries

12
00:01:04,697 --> 00:01:07,165
and potentially
redefine the genre.

13
00:01:15,575 --> 00:01:19,272
Who he found
was Electric Apricot.

14
00:01:23,483 --> 00:01:27,283
What he achieved
was Enlightenment.

15
00:01:27,353 --> 00:01:28,877
(Man)
Well, I've been
doing yoga all day,

16
00:01:28,955 --> 00:01:31,287
but I do that every day,
so I guess that's not special,

17
00:01:31,357 --> 00:01:33,222
but, yes, I've prepared
a couple pieces

18
00:01:33,293 --> 00:01:36,160
and I also wrapped
a couple things of sage

19
00:01:36,229 --> 00:01:37,355
that I grew in my garden-

20
00:01:37,430 --> 00:01:39,990
some pineapple sage,
some lavender sage together

21
00:01:40,066 --> 00:01:41,260
I think are going
to really help

22
00:01:41,334 --> 00:01:43,325
cleanse the room
before we start

23
00:01:43,403 --> 00:01:46,429
It's got a peazio
pickup in here.
Peazio.

24
00:01:46,505 --> 00:01:48,996
I don't know what that means,
but it sounds cool, huh?
Yeah, man.

25
00:01:49,075 --> 00:01:51,543
Whose car did you borrow?
That's my sister's.

26
00:01:51,611 --> 00:01:53,169
(Narrator)
To fully understand the band,

27
00:01:53,246 --> 00:01:55,077
we must first examine
the music scene

28
00:01:55,148 --> 00:01:57,708
that spawned this colorful
group of troubadours

29
00:01:57,784 --> 00:01:59,809
we call Electric Apricot.

30
00:01:59,886 --> 00:02:03,322
Known as Jam Band music,
this scene has been expanding

31
00:02:03,389 --> 00:02:06,119
and evolving rapidly
over the past several years.

32
00:02:09,662 --> 00:02:12,961
I think the jam scene
is really, um, free-loving

33
00:02:13,032 --> 00:02:14,727
with a bit of,
like, ass-shaking

34
00:02:14,801 --> 00:02:17,065
and, like, kind of just,
you know, crazy, like, wow.

35
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:20,106
It's about dancing,
it's about shaking loose

36
00:02:20,173 --> 00:02:23,904
your normal everyday stresses
and getting into a fun space.

37
00:02:23,977 --> 00:02:26,138
The band plays
a two-minute song,

38
00:02:26,212 --> 00:02:28,407
goes into ten minutes
of silliness,

39
00:02:28,481 --> 00:02:31,348
and creates new music

40
00:02:31,417 --> 00:02:32,543
that's never been
played before.

41
00:02:32,619 --> 00:02:35,087
Ultimately, jamming
is all about language.

42
00:02:35,155 --> 00:02:36,247
It's all about language.

43
00:02:36,322 --> 00:02:39,485
Wittgenstein says,
is that language-

44
00:02:39,559 --> 00:02:40,719
all philosophy
is meaningless

45
00:02:40,793 --> 00:02:42,158
because language
is meaningless.

46
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:44,662
(Man)
It's great
to see new blood

47
00:02:44,731 --> 00:02:49,998
in the improvisational
rock 'n' roll music scene.

48
00:02:50,069 --> 00:02:52,503
I get a little squirmy
when people try

49
00:02:52,572 --> 00:02:54,563
and categorize us one way
or another, you know?

50
00:02:54,641 --> 00:02:56,199
We could be...
We could be, like,

51
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,675
a Jam Band thing
one minute,

52
00:02:57,744 --> 00:02:59,871
and then we can get
into some funkiness.

53
00:03:08,154 --> 00:03:11,123
For somebody to go out there
with a bunch of sequencers

54
00:03:11,191 --> 00:03:15,150
and put on a show
that's pretty much

55
00:03:15,228 --> 00:03:17,992
note-for-note every time
flies in the face of what

56
00:03:18,064 --> 00:03:21,830
American musical culture
is about, in my opinion.

57
00:03:21,901 --> 00:03:24,335
Playing music, you should
just fucking jam it.

58
00:03:24,404 --> 00:03:27,202
You should jam it,
and jam it hard, jam it true.

59
00:03:27,273 --> 00:03:29,764
People can see,
they can interact with me,
I can interact with them.

60
00:03:29,842 --> 00:03:31,537
I can give them
some of my looks.

61
00:03:31,611 --> 00:03:33,943
Jimmy air freshener, man.

62
00:03:34,013 --> 00:03:35,071
You see that?

63
00:03:35,148 --> 00:03:37,378
It's always gonna
smell like Jimmy.

64
00:03:37,450 --> 00:03:39,884
(imitates Hendrix on guitar)

65
00:03:39,953 --> 00:03:41,318
(sniffing)
Jimmy!

66
00:03:41,387 --> 00:03:45,221
When I'm playing
and I'm doing
one of my fills

67
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,259
I try and make eye contact
with somebody

68
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,158
just to kind of give them
a little something

69
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,890
to take home with them.

70
00:03:55,034 --> 00:03:57,628
(Man)
There's a place.

71
00:03:57,704 --> 00:03:59,296
A wondrous place.

72
00:03:59,372 --> 00:04:02,102
(crowd screaming)

73
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:05,372
A place out on the playa,

74
00:04:05,445 --> 00:04:07,913
where like-minded individuals

75
00:04:07,981 --> 00:04:13,044
can get together
and share ideas.

76
00:04:17,390 --> 00:04:21,486
It's a place that
knows no boundaries,

77
00:04:21,561 --> 00:04:25,622
except for those that
are set by your own mind.

78
00:04:27,634 --> 00:04:30,125
Creativity blooms.

79
00:04:33,940 --> 00:04:34,964
That place...

80
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:42,514
is a place called...

81
00:04:42,582 --> 00:04:46,951
Burning Man

82
00:04:48,488 --> 00:04:52,822
Burning Man

83
00:04:54,027 --> 00:04:58,327
Burning Man

84
00:04:59,766 --> 00:05:03,600
Burning Man

85
00:05:06,139 --> 00:05:09,575
Hey, are you going
to Burning Man?

86
00:05:09,642 --> 00:05:13,100
To bury your toes
in the desert sand

87
00:05:13,179 --> 00:05:17,081
Ain't no man born
to tell you how to be

88
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:20,017
(Be)

89
00:05:20,086 --> 00:05:23,214
I'll take you
to Burning Man

90
00:05:23,289 --> 00:05:26,622
I've got a recipe
for cosmic flan

91
00:05:26,693 --> 00:05:30,993
Strip off your clothes
and set your aura free

92
00:05:31,064 --> 00:05:36,559
(Free)

93
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:39,696
There's a place I've been
called Black Rock City

94
00:05:39,772 --> 00:05:41,603
Where we're taught
to get down

95
00:05:41,674 --> 00:05:43,904
Onto Juilliard
at evening

96
00:05:43,976 --> 00:05:46,774
Waltz in with my saxophone

97
00:05:46,846 --> 00:05:51,806
Searching for answers
and feasting on the world

98
00:05:51,884 --> 00:05:53,749
Ah

99
00:05:53,820 --> 00:05:55,811
I first saw them
on Earth day in Modesto.

100
00:05:55,888 --> 00:05:57,412
Killer show.

101
00:05:57,490 --> 00:06:00,220
And then I saw them
at the Santa Rosa
Agricultural Festival

102
00:06:00,293 --> 00:06:02,284
at Windsor Waterworks,
which was-

103
00:06:02,362 --> 00:06:05,229
it totally went off,
and I was in the front
and I'm doing the cube.

104
00:06:05,298 --> 00:06:07,630
You know, it's this
dance I made up.

105
00:06:07,700 --> 00:06:10,533
What I do is I make
a cube with my hands.

106
00:06:10,603 --> 00:06:16,007
Um... I just kinda started
going like that

107
00:06:16,075 --> 00:06:19,101
and I just sort of made
a square shape,

108
00:06:19,178 --> 00:06:22,636
more like
a three-dimensional square.

109
00:06:22,715 --> 00:06:25,013
(Narrator)
A tight-knit group
of individuals,

110
00:06:25,084 --> 00:06:27,985
the Jam scene flourishes
through communal interaction,

111
00:06:28,054 --> 00:06:30,750
be it via the internet,
tape-trading,

112
00:06:30,823 --> 00:06:32,916
or multi-genred festivals,

113
00:06:32,992 --> 00:06:35,119
one of the premier events
being the Northwest's

114
00:06:35,194 --> 00:06:38,630
own musical extravaganza,
Festeroo.

115
00:06:38,698 --> 00:06:39,892
Festeroo.
Festeroo.

116
00:06:39,966 --> 00:06:41,524
Festeroo.
Festeroo, man.

117
00:06:41,601 --> 00:06:43,501
Do I know about Festeroo?

118
00:06:43,569 --> 00:06:45,366
(Narrator)
With it's tree-lined
rural setting

119
00:06:45,438 --> 00:06:47,303
just northwest
of Portland, Oregon,

120
00:06:47,373 --> 00:06:50,001
Festeroo has been host
to some of the top-named acts

121
00:06:50,076 --> 00:06:53,170
in the Jam scene
since autumn of 2001.

122
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:55,305
The Jam festivals
are basically mud-fests

123
00:06:55,381 --> 00:06:56,473
like any festivals.

124
00:06:56,549 --> 00:06:58,380
Festeroo- there's fire,
there's circus,

125
00:06:58,451 --> 00:06:59,941
there's Jam, there's beat.

126
00:07:00,019 --> 00:07:03,614
People walking around
with no tops on,
that's awesome.

127
00:07:03,689 --> 00:07:05,122
Bathing in the river,
that's awesome.

128
00:07:05,191 --> 00:07:08,058
Yeah, it was
the greatest thing l...
pinnacle experience.

129
00:07:08,127 --> 00:07:10,152
l... l... I shat myself.
It was awesome.

130
00:07:10,229 --> 00:07:12,424
(Man)
Dude, total meltdown.
I don't know what happened.

131
00:07:12,498 --> 00:07:14,966
I just lost my keys
right before the gig.

132
00:07:15,034 --> 00:07:16,433
We got all this
important stuff in there.

133
00:07:16,502 --> 00:07:19,062
I gotta get this stuff out.

134
00:07:19,138 --> 00:07:20,833
No keys.

135
00:07:20,907 --> 00:07:23,774
But... who knows?

136
00:07:23,843 --> 00:07:24,775
Weak.

137
00:07:24,844 --> 00:07:26,106
Super weak.

138
00:07:26,179 --> 00:07:27,942
The light on
my laminate saved me,

139
00:07:28,014 --> 00:07:29,811
usually because I got
a light on my key.

140
00:07:29,882 --> 00:07:31,042
Uh-oh.

141
00:07:31,117 --> 00:07:33,984
My goal, as manager,
is to continually

142
00:07:34,053 --> 00:07:37,113
try to raise the profile
of this band.

143
00:07:37,190 --> 00:07:40,523
We've got some upcoming
local gigs, which is great.

144
00:07:40,593 --> 00:07:42,458
Then next week,
we go into the studio

145
00:07:42,527 --> 00:07:44,119
to record
the band's first album

146
00:07:44,197 --> 00:07:46,256
on my friend's record label.

147
00:07:47,967 --> 00:07:50,629
The real deal is I've been
working some angles

148
00:07:50,703 --> 00:07:53,570
to try to get the band
into Festeroo.

149
00:07:53,639 --> 00:07:55,607
Have you done
Ford Windstars before?

150
00:07:57,376 --> 00:07:59,469
(Aiwass)
Oh man, we played so many...
We played, like-

151
00:07:59,545 --> 00:08:01,410
we played basically
coffeehouses.

152
00:08:01,481 --> 00:08:04,416
You know, we play
all kinds of different
coffeehouses around town.

153
00:08:04,484 --> 00:08:07,009
I mean, basically we'd set up
in front of the coffeehouse,

154
00:08:07,086 --> 00:08:09,281
but we'd just
put our hats down.

155
00:08:09,355 --> 00:08:12,449
And I think it was Don,
Don Kleinfeld, our manager,

156
00:08:12,525 --> 00:08:15,551
who first introduced us,
me and Steve, to Lapdog.

157
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,119
He was like, Hey, man,
why don't you guys
get some percussion?

158
00:08:18,197 --> 00:08:20,722
I know this guy, Lapdog.

159
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,700
You know, I had been
in this band Illucifer,

160
00:08:22,768 --> 00:08:25,100
which was
the illusive Lucifer,

161
00:08:25,171 --> 00:08:26,297
which was this metal band.

162
00:08:26,372 --> 00:08:28,272
And then I got
into the funky stuff.

163
00:08:28,341 --> 00:08:30,070
So I was kind of trying
to combine the two things,

164
00:08:30,142 --> 00:08:32,838
so it was kind of like
this double bass metal
funky stuff, you know?

165
00:08:32,912 --> 00:08:35,142
I think he had
some funk band,

166
00:08:35,214 --> 00:08:37,273
Funky White Monkey
or something like that.

167
00:08:37,350 --> 00:08:38,612
In doing the Funky
White Monkey thing

168
00:08:38,684 --> 00:08:40,743
I learned that
there was more to music

169
00:08:40,820 --> 00:08:42,754
with the whole
soulful groove element.

170
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,722
So we started
playing live,

171
00:08:44,790 --> 00:08:47,691
we started doing
our usual circuit
of the coffeehouses.

172
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,196
And then this guy shows up
with this big double-kit,

173
00:08:51,264 --> 00:08:53,596
I don't know,
Tama Superstar Kit-

174
00:08:53,666 --> 00:08:54,826
cymbals everywhere,

175
00:08:54,901 --> 00:08:57,131
and he sets up in front
of Pete's Coffee.

176
00:08:57,203 --> 00:08:59,262
I mean, I could
see their point.

177
00:08:59,338 --> 00:09:02,307
I mean, we did block-
entirely block the sidewalk.

178
00:09:02,375 --> 00:09:03,933
Just playing
on the sidewalk,

179
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,103
it's just not that
conducive to what I do.

180
00:09:06,178 --> 00:09:07,839
You couldn't really
hear us sing or play

181
00:09:07,914 --> 00:09:09,108
because he would...
Lap would just...

182
00:09:09,181 --> 00:09:12,309
he would just solo
most of the time.

183
00:09:12,385 --> 00:09:17,322
Just take five deep breaths
and open up that third eye.

184
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,017
And I'll tell you,
my brother,

185
00:09:19,091 --> 00:09:21,651
we're going to go
on a magic carpet ride.

186
00:09:21,727 --> 00:09:23,922
Because if you never
take the chance to look,

187
00:09:23,996 --> 00:09:25,361
then you'll never know.

188
00:09:25,431 --> 00:09:27,558
We'll go walkin'
through the backroads

189
00:09:27,633 --> 00:09:30,295
Of my mind

190
00:09:30,369 --> 00:09:32,234
Rolling down
that kaleidoscope

191
00:09:32,305 --> 00:09:34,296
Of inner space
and time, yeah

192
00:09:34,373 --> 00:09:37,467
Walkin' down
the backroads of my mind

193
00:09:37,543 --> 00:09:38,737
Take it away, Gordo.

194
00:09:38,811 --> 00:09:40,506
I couldn't dance
because it was so intense.

195
00:09:40,580 --> 00:09:42,775
And I go in there
and people are like,
Dude, what are you doing?

196
00:09:42,848 --> 00:09:44,145
I'm like, Dude, what are
you talking about?

197
00:09:44,216 --> 00:09:46,548
I've been to every show,
and I come here to dance.

198
00:09:46,619 --> 00:09:48,610
I just want to feel the music.

199
00:09:48,688 --> 00:09:50,280
I always have two headbands.

200
00:09:50,356 --> 00:09:53,223
One, to get my sh-

201
00:09:53,292 --> 00:09:55,692
because I like the shape
that it makes my hair...

202
00:09:56,729 --> 00:09:59,960
and one to cover my watch

203
00:10:00,032 --> 00:10:03,490
because when I'm
in the Apricot zone...

204
00:10:06,339 --> 00:10:09,069
I'm living in a world
without time.

205
00:10:11,410 --> 00:10:13,344
Yeah, we're going to be-
we're going to be

206
00:10:13,412 --> 00:10:14,709
at the Sweetwater show,
you know?

207
00:10:14,780 --> 00:10:16,475
I mean, whew,

208
00:10:16,549 --> 00:10:18,016
what can you say
about Mill Valley, man,

209
00:10:18,084 --> 00:10:19,415
that hasn't been said already?

210
00:10:19,485 --> 00:10:21,976
I mean, it's where
mountain-biking started,

211
00:10:22,054 --> 00:10:24,022
it's where cappuccino started.

212
00:10:24,090 --> 00:10:26,615
The Sweetwater's been here
for 30-something years now

213
00:10:26,692 --> 00:10:29,183
and it gets good people
through there all the time.

214
00:10:30,963 --> 00:10:33,261
It's sweet to be
at the Sweetwater indeed,

215
00:10:33,332 --> 00:10:34,924
but unfortunately
I'm a little bit

216
00:10:35,001 --> 00:10:37,492
off center right now
just because-

217
00:10:37,570 --> 00:10:40,061
well, my cell phone
got turned off today.

218
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:41,071
(Man)
Hey, what's up?

219
00:10:41,140 --> 00:10:43,665
My name is Jonah
and I'm a taper.

220
00:10:43,743 --> 00:10:46,803
Hi, I'm Tom Lystrus
and I'm a taper.

221
00:10:50,116 --> 00:10:53,244
I think it should be a good-
a good crowd tonight.

222
00:10:53,319 --> 00:10:55,981
You might want
to set that a bit higher.

223
00:10:56,055 --> 00:10:57,784
My favorite thing
about Electric Apricot

224
00:10:57,857 --> 00:11:00,417
clearly is just the
support of the community.

225
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:01,892
I mean, we come
to tape the shows,

226
00:11:01,961 --> 00:11:04,122
they give us plenty of time
to set up ahead of time.

227
00:11:04,196 --> 00:11:05,663
We've been here,
like, since 3:00.

228
00:11:05,731 --> 00:11:08,222
We're done, we're ready,
we're set, you know?

229
00:11:08,300 --> 00:11:10,996
We're ready to... We're ready
to capture the magic, really.

230
00:11:11,070 --> 00:11:13,231
Now we've just got
five hours to fine-tune it

231
00:11:13,305 --> 00:11:15,034
before they get here.

232
00:11:16,475 --> 00:11:20,343
Gordo, he really wanted to go...
go in a more electric...

233
00:11:20,413 --> 00:11:22,904
He wanted to go-
He's a big Jerry fan,
you know, Jerry Garcia.

234
00:11:22,982 --> 00:11:25,416
Which is completely opposite
of what I wanted to do

235
00:11:25,484 --> 00:11:28,681
because I wanted to go
into more of a British
Morrissey trip.

236
00:11:28,754 --> 00:11:33,817
And if a ten-ton truck
kills the both of us

237
00:11:33,893 --> 00:11:38,023
All of a sudden,
Steve Trouzdale,

238
00:11:38,097 --> 00:11:42,796
as we once knew him,
he sees this Phish show-

239
00:11:42,868 --> 00:11:45,200
You have to ask him,
because it's a classic story.

240
00:11:45,271 --> 00:11:48,138
So we went to the casinos
and we were partying hard

241
00:11:48,207 --> 00:11:51,404
and we hooked up
with these two girls
who turned out to be guys.

242
00:11:51,477 --> 00:11:53,035
It was just, you know-
It was in-

243
00:11:53,112 --> 00:11:54,101
One of them dosed me.

244
00:11:54,180 --> 00:11:56,774
Dosed him with some LSD
or something

245
00:11:56,849 --> 00:11:58,146
and he ends up
at this Phish show

246
00:11:58,217 --> 00:12:00,310
and he just becomes
mesmerized

247
00:12:00,386 --> 00:12:02,445
with the bass player
Mike Gordon.

248
00:12:02,521 --> 00:12:05,422
And all of a sudden,
there's this eruption of color.

249
00:12:05,491 --> 00:12:07,254
And I found out what it was.

250
00:12:07,326 --> 00:12:08,657
Because at first
I thought it was like,

251
00:12:08,728 --> 00:12:09,820
you know,
what's going on here?

252
00:12:09,895 --> 00:12:12,796
Is this some alien battle
or something?

253
00:12:12,865 --> 00:12:14,765
They have, like,
glowstick wars,

254
00:12:14,834 --> 00:12:16,961
where people are throwing
all these glowsticks
back and forth,

255
00:12:17,036 --> 00:12:19,470
And then one just tags me
in the side of the head

256
00:12:19,538 --> 00:12:23,338
and I instantly thought
of Aiwass, which...

257
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:27,937
Aiwass is the entity,
is the spirit that channeled

258
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,607
the right of Thelema
to Aleister Crowley.

259
00:12:30,683 --> 00:12:33,117
The next day at rehearsal
I said to the guys,

260
00:12:33,185 --> 00:12:37,087
you know, I'm Aiwass.
Call me Aiwass.

261
00:12:37,156 --> 00:12:38,748
I am a bass player.

262
00:12:38,824 --> 00:12:41,759
I was like, man,
that's a gift from heaven.

263
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:43,852
Here we are, he wants
to play bass now,

264
00:12:43,929 --> 00:12:47,092
so now we've got a bass
and this big drum set,

265
00:12:47,166 --> 00:12:48,690
and then I'm going
to plug this thing in

266
00:12:48,768 --> 00:12:51,737
and there we go, trio,
Jimmy Hendrix land.

267
00:13:05,184 --> 00:13:07,618
They tried to give us
a little grief because it's a-

268
00:13:07,686 --> 00:13:09,085
because of the lightning bolt,

269
00:13:09,155 --> 00:13:11,885
but it's actually
an 11-point lightning bolt

270
00:13:11,957 --> 00:13:14,118
and it's a little narrower
and it's at a different angle

271
00:13:14,193 --> 00:13:17,560
and the Grateful Dead has
a 13-point lightning bolt.

272
00:13:17,630 --> 00:13:19,689
Ours is quite a bit
different, but...

273
00:13:19,765 --> 00:13:21,164
This is...

274
00:13:21,233 --> 00:13:23,167
This is the premier
mic right now

275
00:13:23,235 --> 00:13:24,327
for this kind of taping.

276
00:13:24,403 --> 00:13:26,064
It's the most expansive
dynamic range.

277
00:13:26,138 --> 00:13:27,105
Very fancy.

278
00:13:27,173 --> 00:13:28,367
It expanded on what
the 4 was,

279
00:13:28,440 --> 00:13:31,568
the Schoeps 4,
which is...

280
00:13:31,644 --> 00:13:33,669
It's what I use.
What Jonah has.

281
00:13:33,746 --> 00:13:35,714
This is really
what we're doing now.

282
00:13:35,781 --> 00:13:36,770
This is the new
technology.

283
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:38,646
You get more of
a lateral sound with that.

284
00:13:38,717 --> 00:13:39,684
It's got a projection,

285
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:41,913
the intake is not
as pinpoint directional,

286
00:13:41,987 --> 00:13:44,683
but what I find is this mic
yields an ambient sound

287
00:13:44,757 --> 00:13:46,452
which captures
all the things that I like

288
00:13:46,525 --> 00:13:48,083
and find most
important about it.

289
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:49,923
You know,
it's the younger kids,

290
00:13:49,995 --> 00:13:51,155
they're really...

291
00:13:51,230 --> 00:13:52,527
it's exciting
watching you grow.

292
00:13:52,598 --> 00:13:54,930
But this mic is better.
It's better.

293
00:13:55,000 --> 00:13:57,491
Do you like milk chocolate
or do you like dark chocolate?

294
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:59,162
You like chocolate,
you understand what I'm saying?

295
00:13:59,238 --> 00:14:01,138
So it's the type of sound
that it yields.

296
00:14:01,207 --> 00:14:02,367
It's great.

297
00:14:02,441 --> 00:14:04,238
It's great
having friends.
Yeah.

298
00:14:04,310 --> 00:14:05,834
Well, it's the 4V.

299
00:14:05,911 --> 00:14:08,436
All right now, 6/8.
Ready?

300
00:14:13,586 --> 00:14:15,053
Damn.
Oh, wait.

301
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:17,179
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
I was getting my groove on.

302
00:14:17,256 --> 00:14:19,247
One, two, three,
four, five, six.
Five, six.

303
00:14:19,325 --> 00:14:21,259
One, two, three,
four, five, six.

304
00:14:21,327 --> 00:14:22,658
Hang on. Wait.
Are you-

305
00:14:22,728 --> 00:14:24,093
I'm trying to get
my groove on.

306
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:33,027
Shh, shh.

307
00:14:34,874 --> 00:14:38,241
On the corner,
Miles Davis, 1972.

308
00:14:38,310 --> 00:14:39,902
You know, I don't
really speak literally,

309
00:14:39,979 --> 00:14:42,038
because if you speak
in a literal way,

310
00:14:42,114 --> 00:14:43,979
it's like,
next thing you know,

311
00:14:44,049 --> 00:14:47,041
everyone understands you
and that's just like,
who wants that, man?

312
00:14:47,119 --> 00:14:50,145
It's like a fucking church,
the fucking church,

313
00:14:50,222 --> 00:14:52,349
the fucking steeple,
and there's the people.

314
00:14:52,424 --> 00:14:54,722
That's Apricot.

315
00:14:54,793 --> 00:14:56,158
I don't know about
the steeple thing.

316
00:14:56,228 --> 00:14:59,629
That's the first I've heard
of this steeple thing.

317
00:15:22,855 --> 00:15:25,255
She train blues

318
00:15:26,792 --> 00:15:29,420
Jerry Garcia.

319
00:15:29,495 --> 00:15:31,827
The man, the myth, the legend.

320
00:15:31,897 --> 00:15:35,230
Well, I wanted
to make a guitar

321
00:15:35,301 --> 00:15:38,759
that looks a lot like Jerry's
because he's my favorite.

322
00:15:38,837 --> 00:15:41,328
What we got here
is this guitar
is a total Jerry,

323
00:15:41,407 --> 00:15:42,965
the recipe is Jerry
and stuff like that

324
00:15:43,042 --> 00:15:45,533
with just a pinch
of Warren Haynes.

325
00:15:45,611 --> 00:15:48,273
Big jumbo frets.

326
00:15:48,347 --> 00:15:51,180
We were in Berkeley,
and we went to one of them

327
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:53,218
Greek Theatre shows,
and then, in the morning

328
00:15:53,285 --> 00:15:54,684
I was still
kinda coming down,

329
00:15:54,753 --> 00:15:58,120
we went to Smokey Joe's Café,
and I was getting

330
00:15:58,190 --> 00:16:01,284
the Holy Moley
Frijole breakfast.

331
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:03,487
I was digging into my beans
and digging into my eggs,

332
00:16:03,563 --> 00:16:06,862
so I went to go grab
a tortilla...

333
00:16:06,932 --> 00:16:09,423
Ah ah ah

334
00:16:09,501 --> 00:16:11,264
Okay, be careful.

335
00:16:11,337 --> 00:16:13,066
And then there it was, dude.

336
00:16:13,138 --> 00:16:14,105
Look at that.

337
00:16:14,173 --> 00:16:15,197
Can you see it?

338
00:16:15,274 --> 00:16:16,571
Hold on, check it out.

339
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:18,610
See?
Can you see it?

340
00:16:18,677 --> 00:16:19,905
(chuckles)

341
00:16:19,979 --> 00:16:22,812
It's like a sign,
the most prized possession.

342
00:16:22,881 --> 00:16:25,873
How... How does he know
it wasn't Jesus?

343
00:16:25,951 --> 00:16:28,010
Jesus shows up
on a tortilla,

344
00:16:28,087 --> 00:16:30,817
it's on eBay for several
thousand dollars.

345
00:16:30,889 --> 00:16:32,914
Unfortunately,
it wasn't Jesus,
because we could've...

346
00:16:32,992 --> 00:16:35,290
Jesus, we could have used
the money for that one.

347
00:16:35,361 --> 00:16:38,194
Garcia. Tortilla.

348
00:16:41,800 --> 00:16:43,324
Yeah, at this point
they started kicking around

349
00:16:43,402 --> 00:16:44,596
some ideas for band names.

350
00:16:44,670 --> 00:16:47,434
Gordo wanted to call it
Electric Mountain.

351
00:16:47,506 --> 00:16:51,442
You know, my idea
was Vaseline Groove.

352
00:16:51,510 --> 00:16:56,004
I wanted Knectar
with a K, a silent K,

353
00:16:56,081 --> 00:16:57,673
like the Phish thing,
with the P-H with it.

354
00:16:57,750 --> 00:17:01,117
He wanted to name the band
Knectar with a silent K,

355
00:17:01,186 --> 00:17:03,416
like knight, like Knights
of the Roundtable.

356
00:17:03,489 --> 00:17:04,421
It's clever, you know?

357
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:05,548
He's an intellectual guy,

358
00:17:05,624 --> 00:17:06,921
and he can come up
with stuff like that.

359
00:17:06,992 --> 00:17:09,893
If you think about it
for a second, Vaseline Groove.

360
00:17:09,962 --> 00:17:12,522
It's like Pearl Jam.
Well, what is Pearl Jam?

361
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:14,429
Pearl Jam,
that's semen, right?

362
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:15,762
Pearl,
like pearlescent jam.

363
00:17:15,834 --> 00:17:16,858
It's semen.

364
00:17:16,935 --> 00:17:19,995
Well, Vaseline Groove,
think about it.

365
00:17:20,072 --> 00:17:22,632
It's like... It's like
a lubricated vagina.

366
00:17:22,708 --> 00:17:25,734
You got the Electric
from Electric Mountain,

367
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:28,905
nectar, and then rine
from the Vaseline, pssh.

368
00:17:28,981 --> 00:17:30,278
We said, let's just
combine them all,

369
00:17:30,349 --> 00:17:33,841
so it was Electric Knectarine
with a silent K.

370
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:36,581
Unfortunately, people started
pronouncing the band name

371
00:17:36,655 --> 00:17:38,520
Electric Connect-arine.

372
00:17:38,590 --> 00:17:40,080
You know, they obviously
didn't get it,

373
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,684
like the Connect-arine.

374
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:45,389
And so that
was tripping us out.

375
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:49,025
So then, Gordo one day,
he's looking at our logo

376
00:17:49,101 --> 00:17:50,625
and he's like... he's like,

377
00:17:50,702 --> 00:17:52,135
Well that's not
a nectarine anyway.

378
00:17:52,204 --> 00:17:55,503
My uncle... I grew up
around a fruit stand.

379
00:17:55,574 --> 00:17:57,508
That looks like
an apricot to me.

380
00:17:57,577 --> 00:18:01,775
Yeah, Electric Apricot.
Electric Apricot!

381
00:18:01,847 --> 00:18:02,814
Electric Apricot.

382
00:18:02,881 --> 00:18:04,576
So there it was:
Electric Apricot.

383
00:18:05,984 --> 00:18:11,047
Queen has insects for eyes

384
00:18:12,357 --> 00:18:13,790
She lives

385
00:18:13,859 --> 00:18:19,058
In a kingdom of lies

386
00:18:19,131 --> 00:18:24,967
She shouts
Your sorrows arise

387
00:18:26,271 --> 00:18:27,533
And laughs

388
00:18:27,606 --> 00:18:33,238
At the hideous cries

389
00:18:33,312 --> 00:18:38,409
The queen has been
eaten alive

390
00:18:39,485 --> 00:18:41,043
Where did you go?

391
00:18:41,120 --> 00:18:43,486
Where did you go?

392
00:18:43,555 --> 00:18:47,252
Where'd you go, Rainbro?

393
00:18:47,326 --> 00:18:50,853
Where did you go?

394
00:18:50,929 --> 00:18:54,626
Oh, Rainbro,
where did you go?

395
00:18:54,700 --> 00:18:57,828
Sailing across the skies
with your mystic disguise

396
00:18:57,903 --> 00:19:00,599
Oh, Rainbro

397
00:19:00,672 --> 00:19:02,970
I live in this tree
for... full time.

398
00:19:03,041 --> 00:19:05,339
This really is what
I consider my home.

399
00:19:05,410 --> 00:19:08,971
Yeah, the tree fort
is in my parents'
backyard technically.

400
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,106
I mean, my-
Technically...

401
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:15,382
Where you going, Rainbro?

402
00:19:15,454 --> 00:19:18,150
Everybody wants to know

403
00:19:18,223 --> 00:19:20,350
Did you catch
some cosmic wind

404
00:19:20,425 --> 00:19:22,859
(searching for key)
Ridin' high

405
00:19:22,928 --> 00:19:24,759
Hi... High

406
00:19:24,830 --> 00:19:25,819
High

407
00:19:25,898 --> 00:19:27,126
Wait, wait.

408
00:19:27,199 --> 00:19:30,327
My gardener, Don Carlos
made this for me.

409
00:19:30,402 --> 00:19:33,098
Something he crafted

410
00:19:33,172 --> 00:19:36,664
from the wood
from his country.

411
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,210
I think it's Venezuela.

412
00:19:39,278 --> 00:19:40,609
Uh, might be France.

413
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:43,443
It's just nature
out here, you know?

414
00:19:43,514 --> 00:19:46,847
How many other people can say,
oh, I woke up this morning

415
00:19:46,919 --> 00:19:50,719
and I saw a raccoon mating.

416
00:19:50,789 --> 00:19:52,154
That doesn't happen very often.

417
00:19:52,224 --> 00:19:56,923
Well, this is the- what I call
the excra-meditation chamber

418
00:19:56,995 --> 00:19:59,190
or, you know, my bathroom.

419
00:19:59,264 --> 00:20:01,494
Maybe it's a little primitive
for some people's standards,

420
00:20:01,567 --> 00:20:02,966
but it's got
everything I need.

421
00:20:03,035 --> 00:20:06,334
It's got running water,
and it's got a toilet.

422
00:20:06,405 --> 00:20:10,398
Well, it's got a bucket
and a place for toilet paper.

423
00:20:10,475 --> 00:20:12,067
And I got art

424
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:15,113
(vocalizing)

425
00:20:22,354 --> 00:20:24,447
This is like- I like...

426
00:20:24,523 --> 00:20:26,491
Cars should be political.

427
00:20:26,558 --> 00:20:29,459
I think you have an opportunity
of saying political things,

428
00:20:29,529 --> 00:20:32,430
and so more than voting,
more than doing anything,

429
00:20:32,497 --> 00:20:34,192
if you really want to stick it
to your government,

430
00:20:34,266 --> 00:20:38,032
more than anything, anything,
you don't even have to vote.

431
00:20:38,103 --> 00:20:40,094
Just put on a few
bumper stickers, man.

432
00:20:40,105 --> 00:20:40,571
Just put on a few
bumper stickers, man.

433
00:20:40,639 --> 00:20:45,099
Shall we go
to Pete's party

434
00:20:45,177 --> 00:20:49,136
Millie's Hacky Sacking
with Cousin Arty

435
00:20:49,214 --> 00:20:52,183
Annie's got a henna tattoo

436
00:20:53,719 --> 00:20:56,688
Grandad's blowing
on a didgeridoo

437
00:20:57,856 --> 00:21:00,757
Blowing glass,
everybody has their thing.

438
00:21:00,826 --> 00:21:03,488
A friend of mine's dad,
he really wanted

439
00:21:03,562 --> 00:21:07,794
an elaborate set
of cocktail swizzlers,

440
00:21:07,866 --> 00:21:09,231
so what I'm doing...

441
00:21:09,301 --> 00:21:12,498
And usually,
people like that,

442
00:21:12,571 --> 00:21:15,597
they have some good money,
they want quality,

443
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:17,301
quality merchandise.

444
00:21:17,376 --> 00:21:20,368
And I realize this looks easy,
this looks like something

445
00:21:20,445 --> 00:21:23,278
that anybody can do,
but it's really not.

446
00:21:23,348 --> 00:21:25,612
I was working
on a bowl one time

447
00:21:25,684 --> 00:21:30,246
and I had this big gob going
and I was leaning forward,

448
00:21:30,322 --> 00:21:32,085
and the whole thing
just fell off

449
00:21:32,157 --> 00:21:33,317
and landed right in my lap.

450
00:21:33,392 --> 00:21:37,488
I burned my scrotum
and it was fairly severe.

451
00:21:37,562 --> 00:21:40,759
You know, a fiery hot ball
of molten glass

452
00:21:40,832 --> 00:21:42,823
on the scrotum is not good.

453
00:21:42,901 --> 00:21:45,461
The unfortunate thing
is I got a lot of my friends

454
00:21:45,536 --> 00:21:46,468
come around here.

455
00:21:46,538 --> 00:21:48,165
And I blow stuff
and I want to sell them,

456
00:21:48,240 --> 00:21:50,367
but usually these guys
come along and they smoke

457
00:21:50,442 --> 00:21:51,670
out of everything
I leave laying around,

458
00:21:51,743 --> 00:21:54,871
so you can't sell
something to a store

459
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:57,005
that somebody's
been smoking out of.

460
00:21:57,082 --> 00:21:58,447
But this one's real nice.

461
00:21:58,517 --> 00:22:00,451
I probably could have gotten
some good money for this one.

462
00:22:00,519 --> 00:22:01,679
Look at the detail here.

463
00:22:01,753 --> 00:22:03,983
I've blown
a couple of dildos,

464
00:22:04,056 --> 00:22:08,993
because you're always looking
for other markets for things,
like the swizzle sticks.

465
00:22:09,061 --> 00:22:10,221
I think that's
going to be great;

466
00:22:10,295 --> 00:22:11,956
that could be
a big marketable item,

467
00:22:12,030 --> 00:22:13,554
because everybody
makes pipes.

468
00:22:13,632 --> 00:22:16,965
This one's actually modeled
after a friend of mine's penis.

469
00:22:17,035 --> 00:22:19,265
He took a picture of it
and sent it to me

470
00:22:19,338 --> 00:22:22,136
because I didn't really
want him to be in here
with an erection.

471
00:22:22,207 --> 00:22:24,198
I'm pretty comfortable
with my sexuality and whatnot,

472
00:22:24,276 --> 00:22:28,007
but when you're in a hot room
and fire's blowing

473
00:22:28,080 --> 00:22:30,139
and this guy's got
an erection in front of you,

474
00:22:30,215 --> 00:22:32,877
it's just not-
that's just not my game.

475
00:22:32,951 --> 00:22:34,248
This one's a little smaller.

476
00:22:34,319 --> 00:22:37,686
This would be more for, like,
sort of the rear entry,

477
00:22:37,756 --> 00:22:39,656
or at least, you know,
sort of a-

478
00:22:39,725 --> 00:22:42,717
uh, you know, something to-
to, um, you know...

479
00:22:42,794 --> 00:22:44,056
I don't know.

480
00:22:44,129 --> 00:22:46,097
We probably shouldn't
go there too far.

481
00:22:48,967 --> 00:22:51,060
Well, the first person
I met in the band was Lapdog,

482
00:22:51,136 --> 00:22:55,004
and we met at an Afro-Cuban
drumming class, and...

483
00:22:56,408 --> 00:22:57,807
You want to talk
about polyrhythmic.

484
00:22:57,876 --> 00:23:00,674
Herschel used to play
in this cover band,

485
00:23:00,746 --> 00:23:04,182
this Huey Lewis cover band
called New Drug.

486
00:23:04,249 --> 00:23:07,912
They would play
and they had the skinny ties

487
00:23:07,986 --> 00:23:09,078
and the whole vibe.

488
00:23:09,154 --> 00:23:11,315
Herschel would be all...
Hip to be square

489
00:23:11,390 --> 00:23:12,721
He'd be doing that whole thing.

490
00:23:12,791 --> 00:23:14,053
You know, I like Huey Lewis.

491
00:23:14,126 --> 00:23:16,720
I remember...
His band was New Drug.

492
00:23:16,795 --> 00:23:18,092
I want a new drug

493
00:23:18,163 --> 00:23:19,528
One that don't make me sick

494
00:23:19,599 --> 00:23:21,328
One that makes me
crash my car

495
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,992
Just like it's a brick
or something like that.

496
00:23:23,068 --> 00:23:24,660
For us, it was
the ultimate tribute

497
00:23:24,736 --> 00:23:26,431
to one of our influences,
Huey Lewis.

498
00:23:26,505 --> 00:23:27,836
It had that beat that...

499
00:23:27,906 --> 00:23:30,204
Om bum bum bum
bum bum bum bum bum

500
00:23:30,275 --> 00:23:31,367
I liked it, you know?

501
00:23:31,443 --> 00:23:34,378
It kind of reminded me
of that Ghostbusters song.

502
00:23:34,446 --> 00:23:37,347
Next thing we knew,
Herschel was playing
keyboards with us.

503
00:23:37,416 --> 00:23:41,409
Multi-instrumentalist,
amazing player,

504
00:23:41,486 --> 00:23:45,820
and he hasn't requested
we do any Huey Lewis.

505
00:23:45,891 --> 00:23:48,086
It opened up to a whole
'nother dimension.

506
00:23:48,160 --> 00:23:52,119
Like, we went
from 3-D into 4-D.

507
00:23:55,534 --> 00:23:57,934
My father was a missionary,

508
00:23:58,003 --> 00:24:00,267
and he was
a traveling missionary.

509
00:24:00,338 --> 00:24:04,832
He was actually an Iraqi
American Indian Hawaiian Jew.

510
00:24:04,910 --> 00:24:10,644
(chanting)
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo.

511
00:24:12,217 --> 00:24:14,151
I basically work here
four days a week.

512
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,811
I make a little
extra money on the side

513
00:24:15,887 --> 00:24:17,650
so I can pursue
what I really love to do

514
00:24:17,722 --> 00:24:20,589
which is play music, obviously,
with Electric Apricot.

515
00:24:20,659 --> 00:24:23,492
Nam Myoho Renge Kyo,
it's a mantra,

516
00:24:23,562 --> 00:24:24,961
a Tibetan mantra.

517
00:24:25,030 --> 00:24:29,330
And what I like to do is that
every beverage that I make,

518
00:24:29,401 --> 00:24:32,996
I like to recite this mantra
ten times over the beverage

519
00:24:33,071 --> 00:24:34,163
before I serve it.

520
00:24:34,239 --> 00:24:36,764
Do you want
a hot chocolate as well?

521
00:24:36,842 --> 00:24:37,866
Two hot chocolates.

522
00:24:37,943 --> 00:24:38,875
Something for you, ma'am?

523
00:24:38,944 --> 00:24:40,343
Can I get a decaf latte?

524
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:43,472
A decaf latte
coming right up.

525
00:24:43,548 --> 00:24:45,573
And for kids...

526
00:24:45,650 --> 00:24:48,312
I like to put a little
extra chocolate on top here.

527
00:24:51,555 --> 00:24:53,318
I don't like to make it
too hot for them,

528
00:24:53,391 --> 00:24:54,949
I don't like to burn
their mouths.

529
00:24:55,026 --> 00:24:56,459
We're not here
to cause discomfort,

530
00:24:56,529 --> 00:24:59,362
we're here to bring
happiness to people.

531
00:24:59,431 --> 00:25:02,400
Thank you.
Okay.

532
00:25:02,467 --> 00:25:03,399
Thank you very much.

533
00:25:03,468 --> 00:25:05,026
You have a good day.

534
00:25:08,940 --> 00:25:11,966
I made those extra special
for you guys with lots of love.

535
00:25:12,043 --> 00:25:14,841
Did you feel it?

536
00:25:14,913 --> 00:25:16,813
(chuckles)

537
00:25:19,451 --> 00:25:21,043
It was kinda trippy
because right around then

538
00:25:21,119 --> 00:25:23,451
Aiwass was going off
on this whole Phish thing

539
00:25:23,523 --> 00:25:25,923
and wanting to get into more
intricate arrangements.

540
00:25:25,991 --> 00:25:28,619
I took it upon myself
to be that guy in the band

541
00:25:28,693 --> 00:25:32,060
who would make us progress
and push us forward

542
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:33,324
in our musicianship.

543
00:25:33,398 --> 00:25:35,730
We would rehearse
and then it was like, Okay!

544
00:25:35,800 --> 00:25:37,563
And we'd go in and out
of these time changes

545
00:25:37,636 --> 00:25:39,035
and then he'd turn off
all the lights

546
00:25:39,104 --> 00:25:40,662
and we would go through
all of this stuff.

547
00:25:40,739 --> 00:25:42,468
Okay, 9, 11, 7.

548
00:25:42,541 --> 00:25:44,338
Everyone would be jamming
and they wouldn't know,

549
00:25:44,409 --> 00:25:46,434
but I'd be like-
I'd still kinda be jamming,

550
00:25:46,511 --> 00:25:48,103
but I'd have my flashlight

551
00:25:48,179 --> 00:25:51,114
and I'd spot it
on the guy's face.

552
00:25:51,182 --> 00:25:53,707
One of those big mag lights,
like the cops use.

553
00:25:53,785 --> 00:25:56,015
Bam, right in your face,
stop the song and say, Okay!

554
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:59,989
Stop! And I'd say,
Okay, sing... sing the parts

555
00:26:00,058 --> 00:26:02,288
that everyone else
was just playing.

556
00:26:02,360 --> 00:26:04,157
Dush! Okay!

557
00:26:04,229 --> 00:26:06,424
Sing what the next guy
was doing over there,
just randomly.

558
00:26:06,498 --> 00:26:08,523
And you had to go...
Bada doo da doo doo da

559
00:26:08,601 --> 00:26:10,159
or whatever the keyboards
were doing,

560
00:26:10,235 --> 00:26:12,032
or somebody had to do
my drum parts.

561
00:26:12,103 --> 00:26:13,661
My drum parts
are very intricate,

562
00:26:13,738 --> 00:26:14,830
they're very difficult.

563
00:26:14,906 --> 00:26:17,306
To have a bright light
flashed in your face

564
00:26:17,375 --> 00:26:20,173
in the middle of a dark room
while you are meditating

565
00:26:20,245 --> 00:26:25,774
on our mistress music
is a scary

566
00:26:25,850 --> 00:26:27,784
and psychologically
scarring experience.

567
00:26:27,852 --> 00:26:30,116
I just started wearing
sunglasses in rehearsal

568
00:26:30,188 --> 00:26:32,418
and it didn't
make it as bad,

569
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:34,481
but there you go.

570
00:26:37,329 --> 00:26:40,298
(crowd clapping, cheering)

571
00:27:55,840 --> 00:27:58,809
(cheering)

572
00:28:14,959 --> 00:28:19,225
Seriously, I don't understand
why anybody would come see

573
00:28:19,297 --> 00:28:20,355
that piece of shit band.

574
00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:23,526
I mean, I respect music.

575
00:28:23,602 --> 00:28:24,899
I love music, actually.

576
00:28:24,969 --> 00:28:27,062
I like to get down,
but, dude, that shit

577
00:28:27,138 --> 00:28:28,435
doesn't make any sense to me.

578
00:28:28,506 --> 00:28:30,201
I just-
I don't (bleep) get it.

579
00:28:30,275 --> 00:28:32,800
Probably one of the worst
bands I've ever seen.

580
00:28:32,877 --> 00:28:34,811
I've seen them come,
I've seen them go,

581
00:28:34,879 --> 00:28:36,779
and, honestly,
they take the cake.

582
00:28:36,848 --> 00:28:38,975
They're seriously
so (bleep) bad
I got pissed off.

583
00:28:39,050 --> 00:28:40,642
I can't handle bad music.

584
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:41,743
It's like you guys
should change

585
00:28:41,820 --> 00:28:43,378
the name of your band
to Day Job.

586
00:28:43,455 --> 00:28:44,649
I hate the Grateful Dead.

587
00:28:44,723 --> 00:28:45,883
I (bleep) hate that band.

588
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:48,425
Honestly, my parents
listen to that (bleep) music

589
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:50,257
over and over and over again,

590
00:28:50,328 --> 00:28:52,592
and my mom did that dance thing
where they do the dance.

591
00:28:52,664 --> 00:28:54,894
At about age eight,
I started realizing

592
00:28:54,966 --> 00:28:57,958
that that guy, Jerry Garcia,
(bleep) sucks, dude.

593
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,163
And my parents
are (bleep) stoned.

594
00:29:00,238 --> 00:29:03,264
Jerry Garcia
is a (bleep) plague, dude.

595
00:29:03,341 --> 00:29:05,206
All those (bleep)
burrito-making,

596
00:29:05,276 --> 00:29:06,937
hip-turning hippies
that listen to him,

597
00:29:07,011 --> 00:29:08,638
and (bleep) tool around
and don't get jobs

598
00:29:08,713 --> 00:29:11,045
and don't do anything,
they can (bleep) go to hell.

599
00:29:11,116 --> 00:29:14,517
The band (bleep) sucks
and they died when he died,

600
00:29:14,585 --> 00:29:16,246
and I'm glad it's over, dude.

601
00:29:16,321 --> 00:29:18,789
I'm glad it's (bleep) over.

602
00:29:18,857 --> 00:29:20,916
You know that
bartender downstairs?

603
00:29:20,992 --> 00:29:22,186
(Gordo)
Yeah, I didn't
like his vibe.

604
00:29:22,260 --> 00:29:24,353
Dude, that guy was talking
hella shit about us.

605
00:29:24,429 --> 00:29:25,953
Started talking about us,
then he started talking about,

606
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:30,023
um, Jerry, and h's like,
I'm glad that guy died.

607
00:29:30,101 --> 00:29:31,193
(Gordo)
What?
I was like, What?

608
00:29:31,269 --> 00:29:33,203
He's all, I'm glad he died.
Fuck him.

609
00:29:33,271 --> 00:29:35,466
I'm like, Whoa.
Hold on.

610
00:29:35,540 --> 00:29:36,734
He said,
I'm glad that guy died?

611
00:29:36,808 --> 00:29:38,708
He said,
I'm glad Jerry died.

612
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:40,301
All right.

613
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:42,175
I'm gonna beat him.

614
00:29:51,689 --> 00:29:53,816
(Bartender)
What the fuck, dude?

615
00:29:53,892 --> 00:29:56,156
Yeah, this is
a good thing, man.

616
00:29:56,227 --> 00:29:59,128
Don brought this cat around,
Drew Shackleford.

617
00:29:59,197 --> 00:30:00,129
Who am I?

618
00:30:00,198 --> 00:30:03,258
Who's Drew Shackelford?

619
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:07,031
A lover of beauty,
a singer of songs.

620
00:30:07,105 --> 00:30:09,403
That's what I'm about.

621
00:30:09,474 --> 00:30:10,771
I'm about spreading love,
you know?

622
00:30:10,842 --> 00:30:13,208
I've got it,
I've got the knowledge.

623
00:30:13,278 --> 00:30:14,711
I'm like a Renaissance Man.

624
00:30:14,779 --> 00:30:16,713
He loves the band,
he's into it.

625
00:30:16,781 --> 00:30:19,511
He's got a big fat pad
up in the-

626
00:30:19,585 --> 00:30:20,882
up in the hills,
and, uh...

627
00:30:20,952 --> 00:30:23,147
So far he seems like
a really cool guy,
you know?

628
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:24,153
He's got some money.

629
00:30:24,222 --> 00:30:25,553
I don't know where
he gets his money,

630
00:30:25,624 --> 00:30:26,750
I'm not asking any questions.

631
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:29,225
He's kinda going
to finance our record.

632
00:30:29,294 --> 00:30:31,819
We're going to do a record,
going to put out this record.

633
00:30:31,896 --> 00:30:32,885
I'm stoked, man.

634
00:30:32,964 --> 00:30:34,556
He's like our Owsley,
you know?

635
00:30:34,631 --> 00:30:37,065
I was just there to say,
you know what, brothers?

636
00:30:37,135 --> 00:30:39,126
You're going down
the right road, you know?

637
00:30:39,204 --> 00:30:40,432
Let me help you.

638
00:30:40,505 --> 00:30:42,803
You've got the wheel,
you're driving the vehicle,

639
00:30:42,874 --> 00:30:44,171
just let me be the gas.

640
00:30:44,242 --> 00:30:46,540
I want to help you succeed,
I want to give back

641
00:30:46,611 --> 00:30:51,173
because I see you in me
and you see me in you.

642
00:30:52,884 --> 00:30:54,749
He's not a stuck-up guy,
you know?

643
00:30:54,819 --> 00:30:57,549
He doesn't hang out
in the Polo Lounge,

644
00:30:57,621 --> 00:31:01,250
or drink cocktails
with umbrellas

645
00:31:01,326 --> 00:31:02,315
sticking out of them
or any of that stuff.

646
00:31:02,393 --> 00:31:05,294
The kind of stuff
that I do

647
00:31:05,363 --> 00:31:07,092
I think really
connects with people.

648
00:31:07,165 --> 00:31:10,259
It's the simple stuff,
but man, the vibe

649
00:31:10,335 --> 00:31:12,428
that people get off it
is pretty heavy.

650
00:31:12,503 --> 00:31:13,834
That's what people
have told me, anyway.

651
00:31:13,905 --> 00:31:17,102
I'm confident that
we are going to bring

652
00:31:17,175 --> 00:31:19,939
a beautiful child
into the world:
this new album.

653
00:31:25,250 --> 00:31:28,083
(Narrator)
When undertaking a recording
in a professional environment,

654
00:31:28,152 --> 00:31:31,747
a good deal of skillful
and tenacious preparation
is involved.

655
00:31:33,458 --> 00:31:35,153
The key to it all...

656
00:31:35,226 --> 00:31:38,423
People are always trying
to get really good snare sounds,

657
00:31:38,496 --> 00:31:42,762
and I think the most important
element to me is the kick drum.

658
00:31:42,834 --> 00:31:48,739
The kick drum...
it's really the meat.

659
00:31:48,806 --> 00:31:50,967
I think the snare
is more the potatoes.

660
00:31:51,042 --> 00:31:53,909
You got your meat
and your potatoes
with your snare.

661
00:31:53,978 --> 00:31:56,412
And maybe the high hat
is more like the asparagus.

662
00:31:56,481 --> 00:31:59,041
Today I expect it's going
to take a little bit longer

663
00:31:59,117 --> 00:32:00,516
because I really want
to get it right

664
00:32:00,585 --> 00:32:02,815
because you only make
your first record once,

665
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:03,819
you know what I'm saying?

666
00:32:03,888 --> 00:32:05,651
You only make
your first record once.

667
00:32:05,723 --> 00:32:11,423
Let me know if that bubble goes
too far out to the left there.

668
00:32:11,496 --> 00:32:13,396
It's usually
worth waiting for.

669
00:32:13,464 --> 00:32:15,989
I've never had anyone's set
take this long to set up.

670
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:18,194
I mean, he only
has four drums.

671
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:21,932
As far as studio stuff,
I'm probably quite a bit

672
00:32:22,006 --> 00:32:23,166
more experienced
than the other guys.

673
00:32:23,241 --> 00:32:25,232
You know
the Geinserle Diamonds.

674
00:32:25,310 --> 00:32:27,141
I don't know if you
remember that jingle.

675
00:32:27,211 --> 00:32:29,076
They called me in
and I played on that.

676
00:32:29,147 --> 00:32:30,808
I played...

677
00:32:30,882 --> 00:32:32,349
It was like
a glockenspiel,

678
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:33,611
but it wasn't really
a glockenspiel,

679
00:32:33,685 --> 00:32:35,277
but it was this
little bell tree thing

680
00:32:35,353 --> 00:32:36,285
and I played on that.

681
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,981
How're we doing?

682
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:40,149
Uh, Lapdog's
still setting up.

683
00:32:40,224 --> 00:32:41,851
He's still setting up, huh?

684
00:32:41,926 --> 00:32:44,121
I view golf
as a spiritual journey

685
00:32:44,195 --> 00:32:48,723
and I am a warrior
armed with a weapon.

686
00:32:48,800 --> 00:32:51,132
This club and these shoes
were given to me

687
00:32:51,202 --> 00:32:54,137
by the High Priest
of the Borborandon temple

688
00:32:54,205 --> 00:32:55,137
on the Maldive Islands.

689
00:32:55,206 --> 00:32:57,470
I envision
that all the evil

690
00:32:57,541 --> 00:32:59,133
and all the suffering
in the world

691
00:32:59,210 --> 00:33:00,802
is encapsulated
in that ball,

692
00:33:00,878 --> 00:33:03,369
and it is my responsibility
as a spiritual warrior

693
00:33:03,448 --> 00:33:07,111
to drive it as far away
from this planet as possible.

694
00:33:07,185 --> 00:33:09,745
(hitting foliage)
Dammit!

695
00:33:13,391 --> 00:33:16,053
That was wet.

696
00:33:16,127 --> 00:33:17,458
Ploink.

697
00:33:19,030 --> 00:33:21,294
I feel all sorts of anger
bubbling up inside of me,

698
00:33:21,366 --> 00:33:23,027
but I'm not going
to let it out here.

699
00:33:25,870 --> 00:33:27,667
That's not bad.
Look at that!

700
00:33:27,739 --> 00:33:30,071
(Oo) hoo hoo!
Look at that!

701
00:33:30,141 --> 00:33:31,108
I'm on the dance floor!

702
00:33:33,644 --> 00:33:35,669
Noonan! Noonan!

703
00:33:35,747 --> 00:33:37,146
That's from like that movie.

704
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:38,910
Whoa!
Look at that!

705
00:33:38,983 --> 00:33:41,713
I need to burn
some sage out here.

706
00:33:41,786 --> 00:33:44,721
Maybe I should go back
to our car and get some.

707
00:33:44,789 --> 00:33:46,154
Yeah, I don't know
about that.

708
00:33:48,826 --> 00:33:50,589
Heh hah hah.

709
00:33:52,830 --> 00:33:55,162
(expels breath)

710
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,198
I know that Lapdog
had a good day out there

711
00:34:03,274 --> 00:34:05,333
and I'm genuinely
happy for him.

712
00:34:05,410 --> 00:34:06,570
I'm happy he had
a good time.

713
00:34:06,643 --> 00:34:10,010
And deep down, somewhere,
I had a good time, too.

714
00:34:10,081 --> 00:34:11,378
l...
(grunts)

715
00:34:11,449 --> 00:34:12,814
I know I got a bit upset.

716
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:15,444
Well, yeah,
Lapdog talking a lot
while I was putting

717
00:34:15,519 --> 00:34:18,317
and saying things
in the middle of my backswing,

718
00:34:18,389 --> 00:34:20,220
that didn't help.

719
00:34:20,291 --> 00:34:22,225
(Lapdog)
Noonan, Noonan, Noonan.
Ah.

720
00:34:22,293 --> 00:34:23,885
Ugh.
Sorry.

721
00:34:23,961 --> 00:34:26,156
That's from that
Caddyshack movie again.

722
00:34:26,230 --> 00:34:29,222
Once this record
goes platinum or gold

723
00:34:29,300 --> 00:34:30,597
or whatever
it's going to do,

724
00:34:30,667 --> 00:34:35,570
then I might just
redevelop my whole set

725
00:34:35,640 --> 00:34:37,039
because I'm sure there'll
be some drum companies

726
00:34:37,108 --> 00:34:38,541
that will want to give me
some equipment.

727
00:34:38,608 --> 00:34:40,007
Then I can just do
what I want,

728
00:34:40,078 --> 00:34:41,602
and l... believe me,
I have some ideas.

729
00:34:41,679 --> 00:34:45,513
The reason I use pictures
is that there's been studies

730
00:34:45,582 --> 00:34:47,049
that have shown
that what you see

731
00:34:47,118 --> 00:34:48,415
affects how you hear.

732
00:34:48,486 --> 00:34:51,751
This picture here
is a picture

733
00:34:51,823 --> 00:34:55,054
of a classic
Jungian archetype.

734
00:34:55,126 --> 00:35:00,393
An archetype is a particular
pattern of energy that you find

735
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,127
throughout the cosmos.

736
00:35:04,368 --> 00:35:06,666
This character here

737
00:35:06,737 --> 00:35:10,366
is a shamanic character
named Mescalito,

738
00:35:10,441 --> 00:35:15,105
and what it symbolizes
is him reaching out
into the unknown

739
00:35:15,179 --> 00:35:19,639
and grabbing some fruit,
fruit of knowledge, say,

740
00:35:19,717 --> 00:35:25,622
to nourish his lady love
who is the archetype

741
00:35:25,690 --> 00:35:26,918
called the Great Mother.

742
00:35:26,991 --> 00:35:28,356
(Don)
Lapdog's just setting up?

743
00:35:28,426 --> 00:35:29,791
Yeah. You guys
remember Mei Pang.

744
00:35:29,861 --> 00:35:31,294
Mei Pang,
what's happening?

745
00:35:31,362 --> 00:35:33,125
Cool.
He's setting up, huh?

746
00:35:33,197 --> 00:35:34,129
Yep.
Yep.

747
00:35:34,198 --> 00:35:35,130
Good thing
I brought a book.

748
00:35:35,199 --> 00:35:37,326
Today, very important.

749
00:35:37,401 --> 00:35:39,232
I'm going to probably
have to do this

750
00:35:39,303 --> 00:35:42,761
seven or eight times
before we even start tracking.

751
00:35:42,840 --> 00:35:45,775
Because, you know, you only
make your first album once.

752
00:35:45,843 --> 00:35:48,107
You know?

753
00:35:48,179 --> 00:35:50,409
She represents all women

754
00:35:50,481 --> 00:35:54,679
or the nurturing aspect
of creation,

755
00:35:54,752 --> 00:36:00,281
and so he is going out
and foraging for fruit

756
00:36:00,358 --> 00:36:02,849
to feed creation,
basically,

757
00:36:02,927 --> 00:36:05,691
and that's what
musicians are doing.

758
00:36:05,763 --> 00:36:11,395
They're sort of
taking their craft,
their instrument,

759
00:36:11,469 --> 00:36:16,998
and trying to go out
into the visionary space

760
00:36:17,074 --> 00:36:19,065
and bring back
something nourishing

761
00:36:19,143 --> 00:36:21,703
to feed their audience.

762
00:36:23,881 --> 00:36:25,075
Where are we at?
What's going on?

763
00:36:25,149 --> 00:36:27,140
(Aiwass)
Lapdog is still
setting up the drums.

764
00:36:27,218 --> 00:36:28,378
Still?

765
00:36:28,452 --> 00:36:30,044
(laughs)
All right.

766
00:36:30,121 --> 00:36:31,247
Where's the beer?

767
00:36:34,959 --> 00:36:37,723
They have this really
good stuff right here.
Uh, huh.

768
00:36:37,795 --> 00:36:41,060
But if your cuttings
are a couple of weeks old,
this is what you should use.

769
00:36:41,132 --> 00:36:43,532
That's really going
to give them powerful plants.

770
00:36:43,601 --> 00:36:45,432
Oh, yeah,
that's what I need.

771
00:36:46,904 --> 00:36:48,929
Yeah, we make a few ducats
in the band and all,

772
00:36:49,006 --> 00:36:51,770
but sometimes it's hard
to make ends meet.

773
00:36:51,842 --> 00:36:54,106
Been working with these
hydroponics for some time now

774
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:57,511
and I got myself
a sweet cash crop in here

775
00:36:57,581 --> 00:36:59,481
going to help me
pay these bills.

776
00:37:01,786 --> 00:37:03,151
All right,
well, here we are.

777
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:04,620
We've got some nice
Roma tomatoes here.

778
00:37:04,689 --> 00:37:06,247
Don't know if you can
see them or not,

779
00:37:06,324 --> 00:37:07,951
but these are
really good for sauce.

780
00:37:09,393 --> 00:37:11,623
Ah, some nice sweet basil.

781
00:37:11,696 --> 00:37:13,425
That's going to be good
in your pesto.

782
00:37:13,497 --> 00:37:16,364
I grow hydroponic herbs
and vegetables

783
00:37:16,434 --> 00:37:20,165
for high-end restaurants
like Chez Panisse, Danko's,

784
00:37:20,238 --> 00:37:21,637
and Boulevard
and all that stuff.

785
00:37:21,706 --> 00:37:24,937
What we got here
is the Peruvian
purple pepper.

786
00:37:25,009 --> 00:37:25,976
See that thing?

787
00:37:26,043 --> 00:37:28,068
Comes from Peru.

788
00:37:28,145 --> 00:37:29,976
I don't Bolivia.
Peru'v it.

789
00:37:30,047 --> 00:37:32,208
(laughing)

790
00:37:33,351 --> 00:37:35,683
Hey, Skip, can you set
that 421 mic

791
00:37:35,753 --> 00:37:37,186
on the second rack
for me, please?

792
00:37:37,255 --> 00:37:38,222
421?

793
00:37:38,289 --> 00:37:42,225
Well, basically my job
is to work with Oz,

794
00:37:42,293 --> 00:37:43,351
who's, like, a master.

795
00:37:43,427 --> 00:37:46,590
Now, the bass drum mic
is a little bit far away.

796
00:37:46,663 --> 00:37:50,064
This D112 down here can be
right up against the head.

797
00:37:50,134 --> 00:37:52,068
Do you even think
you want to use a 112?

798
00:37:52,136 --> 00:37:55,503
Because I wouldn't
use a 112.

799
00:37:55,574 --> 00:37:58,771
What would you suggest?
Something bigger.

800
00:37:58,843 --> 00:37:59,935
Let's just try it.

801
00:38:00,011 --> 00:38:01,205
And if it doesn't work,
we'll change it.

802
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:05,716
I'm Second Engineer
and fresh out of music school.

803
00:38:05,783 --> 00:38:07,512
This is just a cool
experience for me.

804
00:38:07,586 --> 00:38:12,182
I mean, I know all my stuff,
I've taken good notes in class.

805
00:38:12,256 --> 00:38:14,451
I got, like...

806
00:38:14,525 --> 00:38:16,459
like a B-average and stuff.

807
00:38:16,527 --> 00:38:18,518
I am not going to mess
with your good thing, man,

808
00:38:18,596 --> 00:38:20,291
so you just tell me what to do
and I'll do it.

809
00:38:20,364 --> 00:38:22,264
Okay, that goes
on the hi-hat.

810
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,630
That's the hi-hat
right over there.

811
00:38:23,701 --> 00:38:25,896
Yeah, I know what
the hi-hat is, man.

812
00:38:25,970 --> 00:38:27,835
Let's go with
the snare, please.

813
00:38:27,905 --> 00:38:29,702
(snare tapping)

814
00:38:34,644 --> 00:38:36,976
(Narrator)
Though often
a repetitive process,

815
00:38:37,048 --> 00:38:39,073
recording requires
a Zen-like focus

816
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,549
and open state of being,

817
00:38:40,617 --> 00:38:44,053
where ideas and inspiration
can flow unimpeded,

818
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,113
raising the art to a higher
level of musical transcendence.

819
00:38:47,191 --> 00:38:48,783
(snare drum continues)

820
00:38:51,896 --> 00:38:54,456
Yeah, Oz, yeah.

821
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:56,227
I'm not really getting
that in the cans.

822
00:38:59,170 --> 00:39:00,398
Hello.
Hey!

823
00:39:00,471 --> 00:39:01,961
How you doin', man?

824
00:39:02,039 --> 00:39:03,904
Good to see you.

825
00:39:03,974 --> 00:39:06,067
Oz, hey.

826
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:08,270
Oh, hey.
How's it going?

827
00:39:08,346 --> 00:39:10,541
It's good.
Good.

828
00:39:10,613 --> 00:39:12,171
You guys stoked
to be here?

829
00:39:12,249 --> 00:39:13,511
Oh, it's incredible.
Oh, yeah.

830
00:39:13,584 --> 00:39:15,484
It's incredible.
We're stoked to have you.

831
00:39:15,552 --> 00:39:17,577
There's a vibe
that I want to send out,

832
00:39:17,655 --> 00:39:19,282
and I wanted
to bring people in.

833
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:21,052
Like, this is a beehive
and we're making honey.

834
00:39:21,125 --> 00:39:22,183
We're making musical honey.

835
00:39:22,259 --> 00:39:24,318
I've got one thing
to say:

836
00:39:24,395 --> 00:39:26,625
do you guys like
the color platinum?

837
00:39:26,697 --> 00:39:30,326
What do you mean?
Platinum... album.

838
00:39:30,401 --> 00:39:32,665
You know, that's where
the sound's going.
Oh!

839
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:35,831
Oh, I forgot.
This is Abigail.
She's a photographer.

840
00:39:35,906 --> 00:39:37,237
I just want you guys
to know,

841
00:39:37,308 --> 00:39:39,401
I am just going to be
a fly on the wall here.

842
00:39:39,477 --> 00:39:40,967
I don't want you
to think that...

843
00:39:41,045 --> 00:39:42,740
I'm not going to get
in your way.

844
00:39:42,813 --> 00:39:44,940
Hey, Oz,
what have we got?

845
00:39:45,015 --> 00:39:47,813
I'm just finishing
with the floor toms sound now,

846
00:39:47,885 --> 00:39:49,375
and then I'll check
the cymbals.

847
00:39:49,453 --> 00:39:50,784
So we basically just have

848
00:39:50,855 --> 00:39:53,255
some tones on the bass drum.

849
00:39:53,324 --> 00:39:55,485
Is this on the track,
the recorded track?

850
00:39:55,558 --> 00:39:57,617
No, we haven't actually
recorded anything yet, Drew.

851
00:39:57,695 --> 00:40:00,425
We've just been working
on sounds.

852
00:40:02,433 --> 00:40:04,867
Just drum sounds?
Just drum sounds, yeah.

853
00:40:04,935 --> 00:40:05,993
(Man laughing)

854
00:40:06,003 --> 00:40:06,560
(Man laughing)

855
00:40:08,472 --> 00:40:09,996
So- So here it is guys,

856
00:40:10,074 --> 00:40:11,769
the first note

857
00:40:11,842 --> 00:40:13,139
of the first song

858
00:40:13,210 --> 00:40:14,871
of the first
Electric Apricot record.

859
00:40:14,945 --> 00:40:16,003
What do you think
about that?

860
00:40:16,080 --> 00:40:17,707
(cheering)
All right.

861
00:40:21,285 --> 00:40:23,719
(ambient rock intro)

862
00:40:31,996 --> 00:40:34,157
Cut! Sorry, sorry,
sorry, sorry.

863
00:40:34,231 --> 00:40:36,529
Sorry, l-
I hit the wrong tom.

864
00:40:36,600 --> 00:40:38,431
All right, ready?
Are we rolling.

865
00:40:38,502 --> 00:40:39,730
Okay, here we go.

866
00:40:39,804 --> 00:40:41,362
(intro)

867
00:40:43,507 --> 00:40:44,804
Share fishin'...

868
00:40:44,875 --> 00:40:45,899
Sorry, sorry, sorry.

869
00:40:45,976 --> 00:40:47,170
Share what?

870
00:40:47,244 --> 00:40:48,802
I meant to say vision,
and I said, fishin'.

871
00:40:48,879 --> 00:40:50,676
Is everything cool?

872
00:40:50,748 --> 00:40:52,682
Yeah, I'm good, man.
We're just-
All right.

873
00:40:52,750 --> 00:40:55,218
It just seemed like
we got off on a rough...

874
00:40:55,286 --> 00:40:56,218
rough rocky start there.

875
00:40:56,287 --> 00:40:59,484
Hey, Oz, what number
is the bass in?

876
00:40:59,558 --> 00:41:02,959
Your amp is just
incredibly loud.
It's killing me.

877
00:41:03,027 --> 00:41:04,517
You guys okay?
(bass notes)

878
00:41:04,595 --> 00:41:07,155
We need to turn
the bass amp down a bit.
Down?

879
00:41:07,231 --> 00:41:09,290
It's probably bleeding
through all the drums,
right, Oz?

880
00:41:09,366 --> 00:41:10,833
Pardon me?

881
00:41:10,901 --> 00:41:12,334
It's probably bleeding
through all the drums,
right?

882
00:41:12,403 --> 00:41:14,234
I mean, it just
seems really loud.
Yeah.

883
00:41:14,305 --> 00:41:16,500
My favorite book store,
Copperfields.

884
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,509
A lot of people don't know
about poetry is,

885
00:41:22,580 --> 00:41:24,241
the thing about poetry
that is so beautiful

886
00:41:24,315 --> 00:41:26,875
is really not
the words on the page,
but it's how you read it.

887
00:41:26,951 --> 00:41:28,885
It's how... You...
You use your poetry voice.

888
00:41:28,953 --> 00:41:31,820
But through presumption,

889
00:41:31,889 --> 00:41:33,982
even the pleasure pleased.

890
00:41:34,058 --> 00:41:36,618
Unworthy, disliking here
and there.

891
00:41:36,694 --> 00:41:39,720
Liking by the rules of mimic
are transformed.

892
00:41:39,797 --> 00:41:41,287
You know,
that's the poetry voice,

893
00:41:41,365 --> 00:41:42,889
and it takes you
to the poetry space.

894
00:41:42,967 --> 00:41:44,229
Everything is poetry.

895
00:41:44,301 --> 00:41:46,030
Vegetarian Suppers.

896
00:41:46,103 --> 00:41:47,229
Take any part of any book.

897
00:41:47,304 --> 00:41:49,033
We like pancakes

898
00:41:49,106 --> 00:41:50,698
not only for breakfast,

899
00:41:50,774 --> 00:41:54,175
but for supper to occasion.

900
00:41:54,245 --> 00:41:55,337
Pillowy and light,

901
00:41:55,412 --> 00:41:57,312
these golden cakes
are delicious.

902
00:41:57,381 --> 00:42:00,509
With dabs of sour cream

903
00:42:00,585 --> 00:42:03,383
and a favorite
of our cuisine.

904
00:42:03,454 --> 00:42:05,820
Day three in the studio.

905
00:42:05,890 --> 00:42:09,018
We have yet to actually
record an actual track.

906
00:42:09,093 --> 00:42:10,890
But I came back in here today,

907
00:42:10,961 --> 00:42:12,326
I burned some sage.

908
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:14,591
I do want to try
and move my set-up

909
00:42:14,665 --> 00:42:16,428
so that I feel more
in tune with the band.

910
00:42:16,500 --> 00:42:18,593
I want to rotate this
just a little bit
clockwise, okay?

911
00:42:18,668 --> 00:42:20,067
Just this way?
Yeah, just a little bit.

912
00:42:20,137 --> 00:42:21,968
Okay, on the count
of three?
You got a good...

913
00:42:22,039 --> 00:42:24,064
Yeah, can you get a hand?
Yeah, I got it.

914
00:42:24,141 --> 00:42:25,267
(both)
One, two, three.

915
00:42:25,342 --> 00:42:28,209
Oh! Ow!
Jesus Christ!

916
00:42:28,279 --> 00:42:31,271
Oh, oh.
Oh, my God!

917
00:42:31,348 --> 00:42:33,816
Holy shit, dude!
Oh...

918
00:42:33,884 --> 00:42:35,408
Dude.

919
00:42:35,486 --> 00:42:39,149
Hershel, he cut his hand
on a loose screw on his organ.

920
00:42:39,223 --> 00:42:40,417
Just a freak accident.

921
00:42:40,491 --> 00:42:42,186
But, uh, the good news is

922
00:42:42,259 --> 00:42:43,556
he got his tetanus shot

923
00:42:43,627 --> 00:42:45,151
and he's
in good spirits again.

924
00:42:45,229 --> 00:42:47,527
And, uh... onward and upward.

925
00:42:50,367 --> 00:42:52,494
(sighs)
It hurts.

926
00:42:52,570 --> 00:42:54,333
It definitely hurts.

927
00:42:54,405 --> 00:42:56,805
(Burning Man)

928
00:43:10,854 --> 00:43:13,516
Hey, I'm goin'
to Burning Man

929
00:43:13,592 --> 00:43:16,322
Hey, I'm goin'
to Burning Man

930
00:43:16,393 --> 00:43:18,384
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

931
00:43:20,064 --> 00:43:21,156
Well, we made it.
Sweet.

932
00:43:21,231 --> 00:43:22,255
I don't know-

933
00:43:22,333 --> 00:43:24,062
Do you want a water
or towel or something?

934
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:25,533
Seemed like the bass
was a little behind

935
00:43:25,604 --> 00:43:27,629
some of the stuff
I was doing there.

936
00:43:27,705 --> 00:43:30,606
(Burning Man)
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

937
00:43:30,674 --> 00:43:33,507
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

938
00:43:33,577 --> 00:43:34,976
Hey, are you goin'
to...

939
00:43:35,045 --> 00:43:36,637
(drum fill)

940
00:43:36,714 --> 00:43:39,114
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

941
00:43:39,183 --> 00:43:41,811
Hey, are you goin'?

942
00:43:41,885 --> 00:43:43,750
Yeah.
Well, we made it.

943
00:43:43,821 --> 00:43:45,789
Did you- Did you see
what I mean by, like,

944
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:47,756
the bass was, like,
a little bit behind
the drums?

945
00:43:47,825 --> 00:43:49,486
Did you see...
Did you notice that?

946
00:43:49,561 --> 00:43:51,791
I think there's some problems
with the drums, to be honest.

947
00:43:51,862 --> 00:43:53,557
The bass was
a little behind it.

948
00:43:53,632 --> 00:43:55,224
It seems like the drums
were dropping

949
00:43:55,299 --> 00:43:57,494
a little bit, you know?

950
00:43:57,569 --> 00:43:59,503
Some parts of those fills
kinda sounded like

951
00:43:59,570 --> 00:44:01,197
you fell down the stairs
a little bit.

952
00:44:01,271 --> 00:44:02,795
Well, that was
sort of, you know,
syncopation.

953
00:44:02,873 --> 00:44:04,534
You ever hear
of syncopation?
Right, right.

954
00:44:04,607 --> 00:44:07,440
You know, the main thing-
tell me if I'm wrong Oz...

955
00:44:07,511 --> 00:44:09,809
but as long as
the drums are correct,
this is a good take?

956
00:44:09,880 --> 00:44:12,872
You don't think that
you guys could just dub
your parts over the top?

957
00:44:12,950 --> 00:44:14,679
I don't think
it's us guys.

958
00:44:14,752 --> 00:44:17,550
This is our first record.
This is the first song
on the first record.

959
00:44:17,621 --> 00:44:19,748
We gotta make a statement.
You know what, Gordo?

960
00:44:19,823 --> 00:44:21,814
We open up that door,
we gotta make that statement.

961
00:44:21,892 --> 00:44:23,189
You know what?

962
00:44:23,260 --> 00:44:25,387
You only make
your first record once.

963
00:44:25,462 --> 00:44:27,191
Yeah!
Are you goin'
to Burning man?

964
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:28,891
(Burning Man)

965
00:44:38,208 --> 00:44:39,698
You guys ready
for playback?

966
00:44:39,777 --> 00:44:41,768
(Burning Man)

967
00:44:50,888 --> 00:44:52,253
(drum fill)

968
00:44:52,322 --> 00:44:54,051
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning man?

969
00:44:54,124 --> 00:44:55,751
It's like a salad, man.

970
00:44:55,826 --> 00:44:57,487
If we have all the pieces
of the salad,

971
00:44:57,561 --> 00:45:00,052
and they go together,
and it gives you one flavor?
Yeah.

972
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:01,256
If you take, like...

973
00:45:01,331 --> 00:45:03,799
If you take a cucumber out
and just eat it alone,

974
00:45:03,867 --> 00:45:05,232
it doesn't taste
like a salad.

975
00:45:05,302 --> 00:45:06,701
So when we're not
playing together,

976
00:45:06,770 --> 00:45:09,398
and it's all perfect together,
then, you know...

977
00:45:09,473 --> 00:45:11,703
But the drums are like
the lettuce of the salad.

978
00:45:11,775 --> 00:45:13,709
Yeah, was the lettuce good?
And if the lettuce
isn't good-

979
00:45:13,777 --> 00:45:14,744
No.

980
00:45:17,214 --> 00:45:19,307
Hey, it's, uh, day four.

981
00:45:19,383 --> 00:45:21,613
And we've been recording
Burning Man

982
00:45:21,685 --> 00:45:22,913
for about three days now,

983
00:45:22,986 --> 00:45:25,147
which- I know that seems
like a long time,

984
00:45:25,222 --> 00:45:27,019
but if you think about it,

985
00:45:27,091 --> 00:45:28,888
the actual event Burning Man,

986
00:45:28,959 --> 00:45:29,983
it's... it's a week.

987
00:45:30,060 --> 00:45:31,118
It's seven days.

988
00:45:31,195 --> 00:45:32,856
So from that perspective,

989
00:45:32,930 --> 00:45:34,158
we are actually
ahead of the game.

990
00:45:53,150 --> 00:45:54,879
(playback)

991
00:46:09,233 --> 00:46:10,928
It feels good!

992
00:46:16,774 --> 00:46:18,332
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning man?

993
00:46:18,408 --> 00:46:19,807
That was rad.
I think we got it.

994
00:46:19,877 --> 00:46:21,071
What was that?
Did you hear that?

995
00:46:21,145 --> 00:46:22,112
No. What was that?
That!

996
00:46:22,179 --> 00:46:23,976
What?
What, that!

997
00:46:24,047 --> 00:46:25,844
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning man?
(clattering)

998
00:46:25,916 --> 00:46:27,713
What the hell's that?
What the hell's
all that shit?

999
00:46:27,785 --> 00:46:29,013
Are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1000
00:46:29,086 --> 00:46:30,713
Aw, that was the take!

1001
00:46:30,788 --> 00:46:32,915
Dude, that was
the fucking Jam, dude!

1002
00:46:32,990 --> 00:46:35,117
And that wasn't the bass.
What are you talking about?

1003
00:46:35,192 --> 00:46:36,887
The bass is fucking
all fucked up, dude!

1004
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,518
(Oz)
Yeah, the bass
has noise on it.

1005
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:40,187
I'm sorry, it's going
to have to be redone.

1006
00:46:40,264 --> 00:46:41,822
What the fuck, dude?
There's nothing we can do?

1007
00:46:41,899 --> 00:46:43,594
Wait a minute,
we can't just dub it?

1008
00:46:43,667 --> 00:46:45,498
Because I know the bass
was a little behind.

1009
00:46:45,569 --> 00:46:48,094
Yeah, it was behind.
What?

1010
00:46:48,172 --> 00:46:50,163
No, you'd have to do
the whole thing again,
unfortunately.

1011
00:46:50,240 --> 00:46:52,538
What? The bass wasn't
fucking behind, man.

1012
00:46:52,610 --> 00:46:53,736
What are you fucking guys
talking about?

1013
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:55,142
Just cause some fucking
mic cable goes out,

1014
00:46:55,212 --> 00:46:56,770
you fucking
blame it on me?

1015
00:46:56,847 --> 00:46:59,179
I got this chick over here
taking pictures of me
all the time.

1016
00:46:59,249 --> 00:47:00,443
I don't even know
who this person is

1017
00:47:00,517 --> 00:47:03,213
invading our space
of our studio.

1018
00:47:03,287 --> 00:47:04,652
Wait, dude, wait!

1019
00:47:04,721 --> 00:47:06,154
She's here as part
of the team.

1020
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,657
She's documenting
what we're doing here, man.

1021
00:47:08,725 --> 00:47:09,851
She's here.

1022
00:47:09,927 --> 00:47:11,485
I don't know what
she's doing here.

1023
00:47:11,562 --> 00:47:12,620
What are you doing here?

1024
00:47:12,696 --> 00:47:14,220
Dude, you're pushing
a little too hard.

1025
00:47:14,298 --> 00:47:16,061
Well, who is this person?
Dude, you're pushing
a little too hard.

1026
00:47:16,133 --> 00:47:18,067
She's in the room with us
while we're trying to play.

1027
00:47:18,135 --> 00:47:19,329
You're yelling at her,
you're yelling at me.

1028
00:47:19,403 --> 00:47:20,802
You fucked up
the fucking take.

1029
00:47:20,871 --> 00:47:22,395
You're fucking yelling
at me right now
because she's me.

1030
00:47:22,472 --> 00:47:24,440
What the fuck, dude?
She's me.
What are you saying to me?

1031
00:47:24,508 --> 00:47:26,669
What are you talking about?
Did she fuck up
that bass line, too?

1032
00:47:26,743 --> 00:47:28,370
Yeah, she might've.
Yeah.
What the fuck, dude?

1033
00:47:28,445 --> 00:47:30,606
How do you know?
Why can't you bring
a good bass, man?

1034
00:47:30,682 --> 00:47:31,944
That's a fucking
great bass!

1035
00:47:32,015 --> 00:47:33,539
That's a horrible bass!
It ruined the track!

1036
00:47:33,617 --> 00:47:34,811
Dude, you're fucking
sitting there

1037
00:47:34,885 --> 00:47:36,546
like a fucking fat-ass walrus
saying I have a bad bass.

1038
00:47:36,619 --> 00:47:38,450
Fuck that, dude;
I don't know why
it's gotta be like that.

1039
00:47:38,522 --> 00:47:39,955
It's a fucking
Vox bass, dude.

1040
00:47:40,023 --> 00:47:41,923
We're working here
together, you guys.

1041
00:47:41,992 --> 00:47:44,153
You know what, fuck you guys.
I'm going to get fucked up.

1042
00:47:44,228 --> 00:47:45,627
We're working here together.

1043
00:47:45,696 --> 00:47:47,288
Fuck that shit.
Dude, I'm trying, man.

1044
00:47:47,364 --> 00:47:49,093
Come on, now.
I'm trying.

1045
00:47:49,166 --> 00:47:50,292
Gordo, don't walk out.

1046
00:47:50,367 --> 00:47:52,494
The drums were awesome,
the drums were ripping.

1047
00:47:52,569 --> 00:47:55,060
The drums were killer
in that one.

1048
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:56,264
I thought they sounded...

1049
00:47:56,340 --> 00:47:58,604
I'm outta here.
I'm taking a break.

1050
00:47:58,675 --> 00:47:59,903
(Abigail)
Yeah, take a break.

1051
00:47:59,977 --> 00:48:01,911
(Don)
Fuck.

1052
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:03,503
(Drew)
When you look
at the math here,

1053
00:48:03,579 --> 00:48:04,034
it's four days and we still
haven't completed one track.

1054
00:48:04,047 --> 00:48:06,607
it's four days and we still
haven't completed one track.

1055
00:48:06,683 --> 00:48:08,810
You gotta go
and talk to your guys

1056
00:48:08,886 --> 00:48:11,548
and my deal is,
tomorrow, we don't work.

1057
00:48:11,622 --> 00:48:12,554
It's over.

1058
00:48:12,624 --> 00:48:14,148
Day off?
Day off.

1059
00:48:14,224 --> 00:48:16,522
We stop, collect it,
get it together.

1060
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,390
No more bullshit.

1061
00:48:18,462 --> 00:48:21,556
And come day after tomorrow,
I'm going to bring in a guy,

1062
00:48:21,633 --> 00:48:23,965
and these guys are going
to talk to this man.

1063
00:48:24,034 --> 00:48:25,899
What do you mean?
A therapist.

1064
00:48:25,969 --> 00:48:27,368
You're going to
bring in a therapist?
Yeah.

1065
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:32,875
A guy who will let these guys
learn how to communicate.

1066
00:48:32,943 --> 00:48:35,036
It's been suggested
a time or two

1067
00:48:35,112 --> 00:48:38,946
that we bring in a therapist
to... or a mediator

1068
00:48:39,016 --> 00:48:41,507
to various groups
that I was working with

1069
00:48:41,584 --> 00:48:45,145
to see if they can
straighten out some
of the horse shit.

1070
00:48:45,222 --> 00:48:49,420
I do a lot of group therapy.

1071
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:53,088
I've work with many
different groups

1072
00:48:53,163 --> 00:48:57,122
on social harmonology,
which is my field of expertise.

1073
00:48:57,200 --> 00:49:00,260
Great art comes about
because of tension.

1074
00:49:00,337 --> 00:49:02,897
I mean, you look at bands
like The Police,

1075
00:49:02,973 --> 00:49:04,565
those guys were,
from what I hear,

1076
00:49:04,641 --> 00:49:05,869
those guys were
fighting all the time,

1077
00:49:05,943 --> 00:49:06,875
and they made
great music.

1078
00:49:06,944 --> 00:49:08,309
The Everly Brothers.

1079
00:49:08,378 --> 00:49:10,903
I heard they didn't even
hardly talk to each other

1080
00:49:10,981 --> 00:49:15,645
and, you know, I couldn't
name any of their songs,

1081
00:49:15,719 --> 00:49:17,243
but that was great stuff.

1082
00:49:17,321 --> 00:49:19,255
That's the difference,
they fought each other,

1083
00:49:19,323 --> 00:49:20,688
but they didn't
attack each other.

1084
00:49:20,757 --> 00:49:23,191
(Bucky)
And have there been
some attacks going on here?

1085
00:49:23,260 --> 00:49:24,192
Well, yeah.

1086
00:49:24,261 --> 00:49:26,354
I mean, yeah,
there has been.

1087
00:49:26,430 --> 00:49:28,193
Mei, yesterday,
was absolutely...

1088
00:49:28,265 --> 00:49:30,563
I felt like Hitler
at Waterloo yesterday.
Wow.

1089
00:49:30,633 --> 00:49:31,998
I was... I was-

1090
00:49:32,069 --> 00:49:35,561
(Lapdog)
It was actually
the day before yesterday.

1091
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:37,607
I'd love to just go on
that journey with them,

1092
00:49:37,675 --> 00:49:39,540
from where they are
right now out here

1093
00:49:39,609 --> 00:49:43,101
to the studio, right up
to who knows where.

1094
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:47,344
The Grammys
or the MTV Music Awards,

1095
00:49:47,417 --> 00:49:49,783
or whatever the kids
are, uh... you know.

1096
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,445
I want to make a record.

1097
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:54,046
You want to use
my pad here?
(Gordo)
We agree on that.

1098
00:49:54,124 --> 00:49:56,490
Yes, I want
to make a record.
All right.

1099
00:49:56,559 --> 00:49:58,823
I think that's a big
breakthrough right there.

1100
00:49:58,895 --> 00:50:00,522
Don't you think?
No.

1101
00:50:00,597 --> 00:50:03,122
If I had a girlfriend,
I wouldn't be bringing
her in, you know?

1102
00:50:03,200 --> 00:50:04,724
You don't see me
bringing in people.

1103
00:50:04,801 --> 00:50:07,929
You don't see me
bringing in my... bitches.

1104
00:50:08,005 --> 00:50:09,905
What do you mean bitches?

1105
00:50:09,973 --> 00:50:11,964
Well, whatever.
I'm just telling you.

1106
00:50:12,042 --> 00:50:13,669
Mei is not
a girlfriend, dude.

1107
00:50:13,744 --> 00:50:14,802
Well, l...

1108
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:16,903
Mei is like...
you're saying to me,

1109
00:50:16,980 --> 00:50:18,277
hey, you shouldn't
bring your spleen

1110
00:50:18,348 --> 00:50:19,872
into the recording studio,
that's what your saying to me.

1111
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,976
Oh, leave your
lower intestine at home;
you don't need it.

1112
00:50:23,053 --> 00:50:25,021
That's what you're
saying to me.
I think we are
saying that.

1113
00:50:25,088 --> 00:50:26,282
You guys are just
talking silly stuff.

1114
00:50:26,356 --> 00:50:29,917
I'm a tolerant man,
but I've had enough of this.

1115
00:50:29,993 --> 00:50:32,188
Well, we'll take a...
You know what, maybe, um...

1116
00:50:32,262 --> 00:50:34,355
Because I'm really...
I'm sitting here,
I'm ready to talk.

1117
00:50:34,431 --> 00:50:36,922
He bent it.
Okay. Steven?

1118
00:50:37,000 --> 00:50:38,262
We're here to talk.

1119
00:50:38,335 --> 00:50:39,529
This is going
to sound crazy,

1120
00:50:39,603 --> 00:50:42,731
but I've always
wanted blonde hair.

1121
00:50:44,875 --> 00:50:46,740
Why don't we take
a few minutes' break, actually.

1122
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:50,268
I think that
would be best.
Okay.

1123
00:50:50,347 --> 00:50:54,784
I think it has some good
long-term potential

1124
00:50:54,851 --> 00:50:58,480
for me and for my practice.

1125
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:01,080
Well, I've been looking
at a boat, to buy a boat.

1126
00:51:01,158 --> 00:51:03,353
I'm not saying this is
going to give me the-

1127
00:51:03,427 --> 00:51:04,485
It's a good-looking boat.

1128
00:51:04,562 --> 00:51:06,325
It's a house boat,
but it's...

1129
00:51:06,396 --> 00:51:07,624
I don't want
to go into detail.

1130
00:51:07,697 --> 00:51:09,631
I just think this is going
to really help the room.

1131
00:51:09,699 --> 00:51:13,066
It's going to help
clear the space for us

1132
00:51:13,136 --> 00:51:16,128
to express ourselves,
to open up with each other.

1133
00:51:16,206 --> 00:51:18,436
Herschel, I agree.

1134
00:51:18,508 --> 00:51:20,442
I think it's a step
in the right direction.

1135
00:51:20,510 --> 00:51:22,944
I also think
this position change

1136
00:51:23,013 --> 00:51:24,571
with the two of you
swapping spaces

1137
00:51:24,648 --> 00:51:27,674
will help eliminate
some of the tension.

1138
00:51:27,751 --> 00:51:29,480
I mean, I really
was feeling two camps

1139
00:51:29,553 --> 00:51:31,043
sort of battling
with each other here,

1140
00:51:31,121 --> 00:51:34,682
and I think this is a better,
more open, more honest way.

1141
00:51:34,757 --> 00:51:37,191
(sighs)
Honest way to...

1142
00:51:38,428 --> 00:51:41,363
Dude,
that was my coffee.

1143
00:51:41,431 --> 00:51:43,160
It felt really good
for me to open up

1144
00:51:43,233 --> 00:51:46,327
and to tell the band
some of my secrets,

1145
00:51:46,403 --> 00:51:49,395
and to, uh,
become vulnerable.

1146
00:51:49,473 --> 00:51:51,168
I'm trying to set
the tone for everyone.

1147
00:51:51,241 --> 00:51:53,072
I just want to say
right off the bat,

1148
00:51:53,143 --> 00:51:57,637
at group level, that I have
an incredibly small penis.

1149
00:51:59,883 --> 00:52:01,373
Okay.

1150
00:52:01,451 --> 00:52:03,476
Can we make a record now?

1151
00:52:03,552 --> 00:52:06,817
I think we're closer
to being able to.

1152
00:52:06,890 --> 00:52:08,152
We've got the sage
in the cup,

1153
00:52:08,225 --> 00:52:10,716
we've got Herschel's
small penis.

1154
00:52:12,596 --> 00:52:15,656
Well, I mean,
Dr. Bucky, um...

1155
00:52:15,732 --> 00:52:17,290
It's just Bucky.

1156
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,562
If you're going to
call the Bucky part,
you wouldn't say Doctor.

1157
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:23,072
It's just... it's either
Doctor or Bucky.

1158
00:52:23,140 --> 00:52:25,540
Okay, um, Bucky,
it just seems, you know-

1159
00:52:25,609 --> 00:52:26,974
Can I be perfectly honest?
I just-

1160
00:52:27,043 --> 00:52:28,442
You know what,
I take that back, actually.

1161
00:52:28,512 --> 00:52:29,809
Dr. Bucky is okay.
Okay.

1162
00:52:29,880 --> 00:52:32,747
This whole therapy thing
is sort of a new thing for me.

1163
00:52:32,816 --> 00:52:34,545
I'm not used
to exposing myself.

1164
00:52:34,618 --> 00:52:36,950
I don't have
a small penis,
but if I did,

1165
00:52:37,020 --> 00:52:39,079
it'd be difficult for me
to talk to you about it.

1166
00:52:39,156 --> 00:52:41,124
And it would really
be difficult for me

1167
00:52:41,191 --> 00:52:43,819
to reveal that sort
of information

1168
00:52:43,894 --> 00:52:46,362
to somebody named Bucky.

1169
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:51,924
Maybe this is part
of my revelation,
is I just-

1170
00:52:52,002 --> 00:52:55,699
When I think of Bucky,
I think of a marionette
or something.

1171
00:52:55,772 --> 00:52:57,763
You know, howdy...
it's Bucky Time.

1172
00:52:57,841 --> 00:52:58,933
It's Bucky Doody Time

1173
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:00,670
I didn't choose
the nickname,

1174
00:53:00,744 --> 00:53:02,507
it was kind of given to me
on the playground.

1175
00:53:02,579 --> 00:53:04,547
And, um...
You got called Bucky?

1176
00:53:04,614 --> 00:53:05,706
Yeah, and it's
something that l-

1177
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,374
Did you have buck teeth?

1178
00:53:07,450 --> 00:53:08,849
Yeah, my teeth
were maybe sticking out

1179
00:53:08,919 --> 00:53:10,045
a little more
than other people.

1180
00:53:10,120 --> 00:53:11,451
What'd they say?
Yeah, they were like that.

1181
00:53:11,521 --> 00:53:13,284
I'd actually
appreciate it-
Did you talk funny too?

1182
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,256
Maybe you shouldn't
do that, actually,
because that's-

1183
00:53:15,325 --> 00:53:16,349
See, now you're
kind of striking.

1184
00:53:16,426 --> 00:53:17,757
There was a kid
we used to call Bucky,

1185
00:53:17,827 --> 00:53:19,021
had big buck teeth
sticking out.

1186
00:53:19,095 --> 00:53:21,495
He talked funny
and he whistled, too.

1187
00:53:21,565 --> 00:53:23,430
Hey, you guys,
give me back my ball!

1188
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:24,524
Did that make you angry?

1189
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,364
Screw you, Bucky,
you little bitch!

1190
00:53:26,436 --> 00:53:29,837
(Aiwass)
It's Bucky Doody time
It's Bucky Doody time

1191
00:53:29,906 --> 00:53:31,601
(Gordo laughing)
Okay, that's enough.

1192
00:53:31,675 --> 00:53:33,438
I don't think it's very...
(imitating rabbit)

1193
00:53:33,509 --> 00:53:35,807
That's not-
(imitating rabbit)

1194
00:53:35,879 --> 00:53:37,608
Whoa, what did you
get upset for?

1195
00:53:37,681 --> 00:53:39,046
Sorry, I blew up.

1196
00:53:39,115 --> 00:53:42,175
Dude, I don't want
to bum him out,
but is he-

1197
00:53:42,252 --> 00:53:44,516
So wait a minute, guys,
we don't nec-

1198
00:53:44,589 --> 00:53:47,581
I mean, are we going
to do this thing or what?

1199
00:53:47,657 --> 00:53:49,591
Come on, seriously,
Aiwass,

1200
00:53:49,659 --> 00:53:53,026
I love Mei-
Mei Pang.

1201
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:54,154
She's a sweetheart,
you know?

1202
00:53:54,231 --> 00:53:55,255
And she's, you know...

1203
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,266
She's pretty cute, too.

1204
00:53:57,334 --> 00:53:59,495
I say we do it!
Huh!

1205
00:53:59,569 --> 00:54:01,833
Let's just the four of us
make the record.

1206
00:54:01,905 --> 00:54:03,099
Listen, listen.
Team Apricot!

1207
00:54:03,173 --> 00:54:05,539
All I say-
This is what I think.
Team Apricot!

1208
00:54:05,609 --> 00:54:06,940
This is what I think.
Let's just do it.

1209
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:08,671
We just don't talk anymore,
we just make music.

1210
00:54:08,745 --> 00:54:10,474
Yes!
(raspberry)

1211
00:54:10,547 --> 00:54:11,809
All right.

1212
00:54:11,881 --> 00:54:13,815
(Lapdog)
Can I get- I gotta get
another cup of coffee.

1213
00:54:13,883 --> 00:54:17,683
Dude, swear to God, though,
did you see his sweater?

1214
00:54:17,754 --> 00:54:19,346
Yeah, it was, like...
That was, like, Cosby Show.

1215
00:54:19,422 --> 00:54:20,389
(Gordo laughs)

1216
00:54:28,766 --> 00:54:29,994
(Don)
I just got the news.

1217
00:54:30,066 --> 00:54:31,465
I just told the guys.

1218
00:54:31,534 --> 00:54:34,230
We have been confirmed
for Festeroo-

1219
00:54:34,304 --> 00:54:38,070
second day, third stage,
opening slot.

1220
00:54:38,141 --> 00:54:39,165
Thank you very much.

1221
00:54:39,242 --> 00:54:40,766
We'll take it.
We're on our way.

1222
00:54:40,844 --> 00:54:44,746
You know, I think Apricot
getting a slot in Festeroo

1223
00:54:44,814 --> 00:54:50,252
is obviously a great
bonus for Apricot,

1224
00:54:50,320 --> 00:54:54,086
but conversely, I think
you have to look at Festeroo

1225
00:54:54,157 --> 00:54:58,491
and the diamond-studded rainbow
that they're getting

1226
00:54:58,561 --> 00:55:00,995
having Apricot at Festeroo.

1227
00:55:01,064 --> 00:55:04,033
(jam)

1228
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:17,010
(no audible dialogue)

1229
00:55:17,080 --> 00:55:21,915
If you ever take a journey,
travel far and wide

1230
00:55:21,985 --> 00:55:23,748
Just sit down
next to yourself

1231
00:55:23,820 --> 00:55:26,345
And start looking
on the inside

1232
00:55:26,423 --> 00:55:28,687
And everything
that you never knew

1233
00:55:28,758 --> 00:55:30,726
Well, you can now know

1234
00:55:30,794 --> 00:55:32,728
So grab your hat
and your walkin' shoes

1235
00:55:32,796 --> 00:55:34,821
Pick yourself up and go

1236
00:55:34,898 --> 00:55:38,163
Walking down
the backroads of my mind

1237
00:55:38,234 --> 00:55:39,462
(A ringy dingy ding ding)

1238
00:55:39,536 --> 00:55:41,299
Strolling through
the kaleidoscope...

1239
00:55:41,371 --> 00:55:44,238
I've been scribbling some...
just lyric ideas

1240
00:55:44,307 --> 00:55:45,774
and a few thoughts I had.

1241
00:55:45,842 --> 00:55:48,936
And I don't want to impose
any of my ideas,

1242
00:55:49,012 --> 00:55:52,880
but have you considered kind of
looking to group therapy

1243
00:55:52,949 --> 00:55:56,316
and therapists as a way in
for some lyric ideas?

1244
00:55:57,354 --> 00:55:58,286
Nah.

1245
00:55:58,355 --> 00:55:59,879
See it's like
a polyrhythmic thing.

1246
00:55:59,956 --> 00:56:01,548
Right.

1247
00:56:01,624 --> 00:56:03,990
I use these three fingers.

1248
00:56:04,060 --> 00:56:05,789
It's like if you
felt my fingers,

1249
00:56:05,862 --> 00:56:07,887
they're like...
it's like leather.

1250
00:56:07,964 --> 00:56:09,522
It's like a baseball mitt
right there.

1251
00:56:09,599 --> 00:56:11,692
It's really tough.

1252
00:56:11,768 --> 00:56:13,998
Well-
Give us your moves, man.

1253
00:56:14,070 --> 00:56:15,537
I don't really
have any moves.

1254
00:56:15,606 --> 00:56:17,301
I just...

1255
00:56:17,374 --> 00:56:18,841
Oh, oh, oh, oh

1256
00:56:18,908 --> 00:56:21,206
Check it out,
out, out, out
Out, out, out

1257
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:22,744
Check it out, out, out

1258
00:56:22,811 --> 00:56:25,006
Check it out
Check it out
Out, out, out

1259
00:56:25,081 --> 00:56:28,050
(jam)

1260
00:56:35,526 --> 00:56:37,687
(no audible dialogue)

1261
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,529
Hey, man, what's up?
What's up, dude?

1262
00:56:43,600 --> 00:56:44,589
How's it going?

1263
00:56:44,667 --> 00:56:46,897
Just a little fuel,
you know, a little fuel.

1264
00:56:46,970 --> 00:56:49,336
Ham Sandwich,
got my Rockstar
energy drink.

1265
00:56:49,406 --> 00:56:51,306
Look at that.
Those are good, man.
You should be drinking that.

1266
00:56:51,374 --> 00:56:52,807
You guys are going
to be rock stars, huh?

1267
00:56:52,876 --> 00:56:54,002
You got the whole
Festeroo thing going.

1268
00:56:54,077 --> 00:56:55,374
You know,
it's feeling good.

1269
00:56:55,445 --> 00:56:56,810
Yeah, Festeroo.
Doesn't rock
any harder than that.

1270
00:56:56,880 --> 00:56:58,006
We always talk about
that Festeroo thing.

1271
00:56:58,081 --> 00:56:59,275
I think it's going
to be great.

1272
00:56:59,349 --> 00:57:03,911
You guys see me
doing my savvy...
savvy magic in here

1273
00:57:03,987 --> 00:57:06,547
and it's like, you know,
it doesn't have to
just be in here,

1274
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:08,921
it can be on the road,
too, so...

1275
00:57:08,992 --> 00:57:10,323
Just, um-
Cool, man.

1276
00:57:10,393 --> 00:57:11,360
You want
another Rockstar?

1277
00:57:11,428 --> 00:57:13,692
I'm good.
I'm good.

1278
00:57:13,764 --> 00:57:15,254
Too much Rockstar
for you?

1279
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,855
(laughing)
Yeah.

1280
00:57:16,933 --> 00:57:18,924
Okay. Talk to you
later, man.

1281
00:57:19,002 --> 00:57:20,936
(jam)

1282
00:57:21,004 --> 00:57:25,338
Lots of good times
at Uncle Pete's party

1283
00:57:25,408 --> 00:57:29,708
Millie's Hacky Sacking
with Cousin Arty

1284
00:57:29,780 --> 00:57:32,544
Annie's got a henna tattoo

1285
00:57:34,284 --> 00:57:37,481
Grandad's blowing
that didgeridoo

1286
00:57:37,554 --> 00:57:40,148
Hey. Finger sandwiches, guys?

1287
00:57:40,223 --> 00:57:41,155
Yeah!

1288
00:57:41,224 --> 00:57:42,521
I made them.

1289
00:57:42,592 --> 00:57:44,457
(no audible dialogue)

1290
00:57:55,371 --> 00:57:56,303
Hey, what's up, man?

1291
00:57:56,372 --> 00:57:57,304
(toilet flushing)
Whoa!

1292
00:57:57,373 --> 00:57:58,533
Hey, what's happening?

1293
00:57:58,608 --> 00:57:59,700
Pretty nice.
You doing all right?

1294
00:57:59,775 --> 00:58:01,367
Uh, yeah, I'm okay.
Yeah.

1295
00:58:01,444 --> 00:58:03,344
Doing all right.
Heard you guys
are doing Festeroo.

1296
00:58:03,413 --> 00:58:04,437
Yeah, it's pretty heavy.

1297
00:58:04,513 --> 00:58:05,878
Yeah, that is heavy,
that's-

1298
00:58:05,949 --> 00:58:08,281
You want a towel?
Uh, yeah, thanks.

1299
00:58:08,351 --> 00:58:09,579
That's awesome, man.

1300
00:58:09,651 --> 00:58:11,744
You guys are going on the road.
I want to go on the road.

1301
00:58:11,821 --> 00:58:13,049
I'd love to be
a part of it,

1302
00:58:13,122 --> 00:58:15,488
help you guys out
whatever you want,
you know?

1303
00:58:15,558 --> 00:58:16,752
I'm your roadie, dude.

1304
00:58:16,826 --> 00:58:18,794
I'm the dude you go to
when you're on the road.

1305
00:58:18,862 --> 00:58:21,660
Take me.
Well, we'll keep
that in mind.

1306
00:58:21,731 --> 00:58:24,256
Talk to Don and...
I just want to put that
out there, you know?

1307
00:58:24,334 --> 00:58:27,861
I'm not trying to be...
say, hey, you know...

1308
00:58:27,937 --> 00:58:29,063
bear hug, take me!

1309
00:58:29,138 --> 00:58:30,196
Right, right, right,
right, right.

1310
00:58:30,273 --> 00:58:33,970
I'm just trying to say
I went to music school

1311
00:58:34,043 --> 00:58:35,840
so I can help you out,
you know?

1312
00:58:35,912 --> 00:58:37,709
Cool. All right.

1313
00:58:37,780 --> 00:58:39,577
Okay. Thanks, man.
All right.

1314
00:58:39,648 --> 00:58:41,115
You guys want to take
a little meeting?

1315
00:58:41,184 --> 00:58:42,549
Yeah.
Yeah.

1316
00:58:42,619 --> 00:58:44,450
I don't want to make
a big deal out of this.
Right.

1317
00:58:44,521 --> 00:58:46,079
But that Skippy dude?
Sure.

1318
00:58:46,155 --> 00:58:48,282
He's kinda tripping
me out a little bit.
What do you mean?

1319
00:58:48,358 --> 00:58:49,757
He wants to go on tour
and everything,

1320
00:58:49,826 --> 00:58:50,758
but don't make me feel...

1321
00:58:50,827 --> 00:58:52,089
Oh, he wants to go
to Festeroo?

1322
00:58:52,161 --> 00:58:53,628
Yeah.
He's a little
too eager beaver.

1323
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:55,163
Yeah,
that's understandable.

1324
00:58:55,231 --> 00:58:57,699
He came walking in on me
when I'm taking a piss
in the bathroom

1325
00:58:57,767 --> 00:59:00,065
and he's all like, Hey, man,
I want to be your roadie.

1326
00:59:00,136 --> 00:59:01,728
And it's like, hey...
He came in on purpose?

1327
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,999
Yeah... yeah, I mean...
On your bathroom break.

1328
00:59:04,073 --> 00:59:05,404
You know,
I'm using the can

1329
00:59:05,475 --> 00:59:06,442
and he's like,
you know...

1330
00:59:06,509 --> 00:59:08,136
I know exactly
what to say, it's cool.

1331
00:59:08,211 --> 00:59:09,906
Skippy's cool.
Yeah, he's a cool dude.

1332
00:59:09,979 --> 00:59:12,174
Yeah, don't worry about it.
We'll rope him in...

1333
00:59:12,248 --> 00:59:14,273
Um, I just had a couple
of the guys came up to me

1334
00:59:14,350 --> 00:59:18,343
and there's just been
a small complaint about Skip.

1335
00:59:18,421 --> 00:59:20,150
We just need to
rope him in a little bit.

1336
00:59:20,223 --> 00:59:21,554
He's kind of hustling
a little too hard

1337
00:59:21,624 --> 00:59:23,057
and just getting
into people's space.

1338
00:59:23,126 --> 00:59:25,720
He followed Gordo
into the bathroom,
you know?

1339
00:59:25,795 --> 00:59:27,194
He's taking a leak and...

1340
00:59:27,263 --> 00:59:29,788
You know, just kind of
invading space and-
That's weird.

1341
00:59:29,866 --> 00:59:32,733
It's weird and he's been
kinda schmoozing the guys

1342
00:59:32,802 --> 00:59:34,929
about wanting to go
on tour to Festeroo, and-

1343
00:59:35,004 --> 00:59:36,266
Wait, wait, wait.

1344
00:59:36,339 --> 00:59:37,863
He wants to go on tour,
for Festeroo?

1345
00:59:37,941 --> 00:59:39,340
He wants to be
our roadie on...

1346
00:59:39,409 --> 00:59:40,899
I got you.
Nah, I g- okay.

1347
00:59:40,977 --> 00:59:42,444
You know what,
I'll work-
It's no big deal.

1348
00:59:42,512 --> 00:59:44,446
No, no, no, no, no.
No, I got it, I got it.

1349
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,947
Skip's my guy.
I know how to handle him.

1350
00:59:46,015 --> 00:59:47,778
Right.
He wants to go on tour.

1351
00:59:47,850 --> 00:59:50,148
We're not trying
to make a big deal.
It's okay.
I know exactly-

1352
00:59:50,219 --> 00:59:51,686
He's my guy.
I know how to handle it.

1353
00:59:51,755 --> 00:59:53,222
He's your guy, but-
Yeah. No, no.
I know.

1354
00:59:53,289 --> 00:59:54,221
We didn't want to...

1355
00:59:54,290 --> 00:59:55,655
Skip!
Oh.

1356
00:59:55,725 --> 00:59:58,523
Dammit. Skip!

1357
00:59:59,561 --> 01:00:02,655
You, me, talk now.
I'll talk.

1358
01:00:02,732 --> 01:00:04,290
You want to talk
right here?

1359
01:00:04,367 --> 01:00:06,164
No, the question is do you
want to talk right here?

1360
01:00:06,235 --> 01:00:08,465
You want to talk right here,
because we'll talk right here,
if you want.

1361
01:00:08,538 --> 01:00:09,971
Yeah, I mean,
I don't see why not.

1362
01:00:10,039 --> 01:00:12,007
All right, here's what
we're going to talk about.

1363
01:00:12,075 --> 01:00:13,474
I was just talking to Don.

1364
01:00:13,543 --> 01:00:15,101
Don says that you were
talking to the guys

1365
01:00:15,178 --> 01:00:16,805
about being their
guitar tech or drum tech

1366
01:00:16,879 --> 01:00:18,210
or some such shit
on the road,

1367
01:00:18,281 --> 01:00:20,272
that you want to be
a roadie with Apricot.

1368
01:00:20,350 --> 01:00:22,011
Well...
True or not?

1369
01:00:22,085 --> 01:00:23,177
True or not?
Yeah.

1370
01:00:23,252 --> 01:00:24,719
Yeah, dude.
I do a lot of things!

1371
01:00:24,787 --> 01:00:26,550
That's all I need to know!
That's all I need to know.

1372
01:00:26,623 --> 01:00:28,215
Okay, because you're
an employee of mine, Skip,

1373
01:00:28,291 --> 01:00:29,553
you're supposed
to be working for me

1374
01:00:29,626 --> 01:00:31,321
and you're bothering
the guys in the band.

1375
01:00:31,394 --> 01:00:32,918
I'm not bothering them.
That's the fucking
last straw.

1376
01:00:32,996 --> 01:00:34,588
I'm getting a vibe!
Look, I saw you every day.

1377
01:00:34,665 --> 01:00:36,530
It's like, Can I get you this?
Can I get you that?

1378
01:00:36,599 --> 01:00:37,998
Are you kidding me?
I'm grooving with these guys.

1379
01:00:38,067 --> 01:00:39,329
You're not grooving!
Don just talked to me.

1380
01:00:39,402 --> 01:00:40,960
That's what I'm trying
to fucking put in your head.

1381
01:00:41,037 --> 01:00:43,699
Don said
I'm not grooving!

1382
01:00:43,773 --> 01:00:44,705
Dude, I'm grooving.

1383
01:00:44,774 --> 01:00:47,572
The fuck?
Are you kidding?

1384
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,202
I'm working magic
with these guys, buddy.

1385
01:00:49,278 --> 01:00:50,609
What are you talking about?

1386
01:00:50,680 --> 01:00:52,443
The only person
that works magic...
Why are you mad?

1387
01:00:52,515 --> 01:00:54,278
with the fucking band is me

1388
01:00:54,350 --> 01:00:55,681
because I'm the fucking
magic man.

1389
01:00:55,752 --> 01:00:57,014
End of fucking story.

1390
01:00:57,086 --> 01:00:59,054
You're trying to brown-nose
your fucking way in.

1391
01:00:59,122 --> 01:01:00,555
I'm the go-to guy...

1392
01:01:00,623 --> 01:01:03,023
That's not
brown-nosing, dude!
Guess what, motherfucker.

1393
01:01:03,092 --> 01:01:06,550
Go to your fucking home
because you're fucking fired!

1394
01:01:06,629 --> 01:01:08,961
Step! It's over!

1395
01:01:09,032 --> 01:01:10,966
Go, go-to guy. Go!

1396
01:01:11,034 --> 01:01:12,296
(tap thighs)
Let's go!

1397
01:01:12,368 --> 01:01:14,495
Are you serious?
Go! Done!

1398
01:01:14,569 --> 01:01:17,766
Fucking done!
Done! Go!

1399
01:01:20,043 --> 01:01:20,975
That was heavy, man.

1400
01:01:21,044 --> 01:01:22,102
What the hell
was that all about?

1401
01:01:22,178 --> 01:01:23,202
I don't know, dude.
Jesus!

1402
01:01:23,279 --> 01:01:24,576
Skip just got canned.

1403
01:01:30,053 --> 01:01:33,022
(sniffling, crying)

1404
01:01:34,924 --> 01:01:36,551
You want some footage?

1405
01:01:36,626 --> 01:01:39,561
You want some
fucking footage, buddy?

1406
01:01:39,629 --> 01:01:41,688
I'll give you some footage.

1407
01:01:41,764 --> 01:01:44,426
You ever heard
of Drew Shackleford?

1408
01:01:44,500 --> 01:01:46,161
I have.

1409
01:01:47,770 --> 01:01:50,068
And he hasn't heard
the last of me.

1410
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:56,239
I worked my ass off
for that guy.

1411
01:01:58,514 --> 01:02:00,641
My ass!

1412
01:02:02,518 --> 01:02:04,179
Fuck you, Drew!

1413
01:02:04,253 --> 01:02:05,277
(starts engine)

1414
01:02:05,354 --> 01:02:07,083
(squealing)

1415
01:02:07,156 --> 01:02:09,556
(revving)

1416
01:02:09,624 --> 01:02:11,216
You hear that?

1417
01:02:11,294 --> 01:02:13,854
That's a big
fuck you, buddy!

1418
01:02:20,303 --> 01:02:21,270
Ready? Here we go.

1419
01:02:21,337 --> 01:02:24,306
(jam)

1420
01:02:32,315 --> 01:02:35,284
(indistinct singing)

1421
01:02:51,200 --> 01:02:52,997
(crescendo)

1422
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,900
What's going on
with the party?

1423
01:02:54,971 --> 01:02:57,405
What's going on
with the party?

1424
01:02:57,473 --> 01:02:58,531
There we go.
(Don)
Dude.

1425
01:02:58,608 --> 01:02:59,973
(Drew)
That's it.
That's it.

1426
01:03:00,042 --> 01:03:01,339
Did you hear my drums?
They were ripping.

1427
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:02,809
Dude, you were nailing it.
You hear that?

1428
01:03:02,879 --> 01:03:05,177
I think we found a rainbow.

1429
01:03:05,248 --> 01:03:07,307
I think I listened today

1430
01:03:07,383 --> 01:03:08,941
to one of the most
beautiful-

1431
01:03:09,018 --> 01:03:11,350
(voice catching)
beautiful rainbows that
I've heard in a long time.

1432
01:03:11,420 --> 01:03:14,821
And I think part of that...

1433
01:03:14,891 --> 01:03:16,620
(sighs)

1434
01:03:16,692 --> 01:03:19,991
part of the thanks should go
to Dr. Lefkowitz, man,

1435
01:03:20,062 --> 01:03:22,929
for just bringing us together
and making us all feel right.

1436
01:03:22,999 --> 01:03:25,866
Thanks for making us
all right, dude.
It was my pleasure.

1437
01:03:25,935 --> 01:03:28,267
It's good to be part
of the team, the team.

1438
01:03:28,337 --> 01:03:29,326
Yeah.
Appreciate it, man.

1439
01:03:29,405 --> 01:03:30,929
Sorry about all
that sweater stuff.

1440
01:03:31,007 --> 01:03:32,406
We've come out
on the other side, right?

1441
01:03:32,475 --> 01:03:34,773
He was able to really get
into the groove here,

1442
01:03:34,844 --> 01:03:36,038
became part of our family.

1443
01:03:36,112 --> 01:03:38,239
Drew, I wasn't sure
about this whole thing.

1444
01:03:38,314 --> 01:03:40,782
I just- you know, hey,
you were right, so...

1445
01:03:40,850 --> 01:03:42,545
(Lapdog)
Using physics...

1446
01:03:42,618 --> 01:03:46,577
Well, reality is you make
your first record once.

1447
01:03:46,656 --> 01:03:48,180
Right?
Seriously.

1448
01:03:48,257 --> 01:03:49,656
It's like, you have
your first baby once.

1449
01:03:49,725 --> 01:03:50,919
I hear you what
you're saying, dude.

1450
01:03:50,993 --> 01:03:53,985
You eat your first
ham sandwich once.

1451
01:03:54,063 --> 01:03:56,998
I believe in you guys
so much, and, uh...

1452
01:03:57,066 --> 01:03:59,864
you guys gave back
what I gave.

1453
01:03:59,936 --> 01:04:01,767
Thank you for having us
and for putting this
all together

1454
01:04:01,838 --> 01:04:03,135
because we really
couldn't do it without you.

1455
01:04:03,206 --> 01:04:05,071
We wouldn't be here
without you, you know?

1456
01:04:05,141 --> 01:04:06,199
We'd be somewhere else.

1457
01:04:06,275 --> 01:04:09,642
In the end, we have
really produced a beautiful,

1458
01:04:09,712 --> 01:04:14,308
beautiful bouncing baby album.

1459
01:04:14,383 --> 01:04:15,315
I'm happy, dude.

1460
01:04:15,384 --> 01:04:17,284
It was a...
It was a good finish.

1461
01:04:17,353 --> 01:04:19,480
It was a wild ride.

1462
01:04:19,555 --> 01:04:21,682
Next step: Festeroo.

1463
01:04:26,996 --> 01:04:29,897
(Narrator)
The camaraderie amongst
musicians remains unchanged,

1464
01:04:29,966 --> 01:04:31,957
as with minstrels
of ages past

1465
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:35,367
following well-worn roads
to musical fulfillment.

1466
01:04:35,438 --> 01:04:37,201
People talk about Route 66.

1467
01:04:37,273 --> 01:04:39,639
Well, I'll tell you
something right now.

1468
01:04:39,709 --> 01:04:41,176
I'm alive.
Ain't no jive.

1469
01:04:41,244 --> 01:04:43,439
We're cruisin'
on up Highway 5.

1470
01:04:43,511 --> 01:04:45,604
Highway 5,
take a look at that.

1471
01:04:46,983 --> 01:04:48,780
Hey, man.

1472
01:04:48,851 --> 01:04:49,943
(chuckling)

1473
01:04:50,019 --> 01:04:51,111
(Lapdog)
Hang on to your hats!

1474
01:04:51,187 --> 01:04:52,882
I'm so excited
about Festeroo

1475
01:04:52,955 --> 01:04:55,446
I actually need to do
more meditating every day

1476
01:04:55,524 --> 01:04:56,582
than I usually do.

1477
01:04:56,659 --> 01:04:57,921
This is my space.

1478
01:04:57,994 --> 01:05:02,124
I need my world
where I can meditate...

1479
01:05:02,198 --> 01:05:04,029
Make love to myself
in ways that aren't sexual,

1480
01:05:04,100 --> 01:05:05,226
but is love.

1481
01:05:05,301 --> 01:05:08,566
We got, what, six,
seven guys on this thing?

1482
01:05:08,638 --> 01:05:11,698
And slowly, the motorhome
is becoming the odorhome,

1483
01:05:11,774 --> 01:05:13,071
if you know
what I'm saying.

1484
01:05:13,142 --> 01:05:14,905
(Herschel)
Look at all that
tie-dye and hair, baby.

1485
01:05:14,977 --> 01:05:17,138
Nothing but tie-dye and hair.

1486
01:05:18,714 --> 01:05:20,682
Awesome bunch of chicks!

1487
01:05:20,750 --> 01:05:22,012
You see that?

1488
01:05:22,084 --> 01:05:25,144
Holy shit!
That was a bunch of chicks!

1489
01:05:25,221 --> 01:05:28,019
Whoa, dude!
Slow down! Hey!

1490
01:05:28,090 --> 01:05:29,284
(Aiwass)
I got a new song.
Ready?

1491
01:05:29,358 --> 01:05:34,386
Psychic officer

1492
01:05:34,463 --> 01:05:36,488
Come on down

1493
01:05:36,565 --> 01:05:40,695
You're the psychic officer

1494
01:05:40,771 --> 01:05:43,433
You bust like an oven

1495
01:05:43,506 --> 01:05:45,531
You're like...
That sounds familiar.

1496
01:05:45,608 --> 01:05:46,836
You're like a-

1497
01:05:46,909 --> 01:05:48,240
Well, all songs kind of
sound familiar.

1498
01:05:48,311 --> 01:05:49,403
Officer

1499
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:51,002
Do it. Ready?
(guitar)

1500
01:05:51,080 --> 01:05:54,106
Psychic officer
O-Officer

1501
01:05:54,183 --> 01:05:56,947
Yes.
Psychic officer

1502
01:05:57,019 --> 01:05:58,384
I've heard this song, man.

1503
01:06:01,657 --> 01:06:06,720
The queen
has insects for eyes

1504
01:06:08,431 --> 01:06:13,664
She lives
in a kingdom of lies

1505
01:06:16,839 --> 01:06:19,239
I swear to God, if I had
a nickel for every idiot

1506
01:06:19,308 --> 01:06:21,435
that I see on the road,
I'd be a rich man.

1507
01:06:22,778 --> 01:06:24,075
Hey! That's what
I'm talking about.

1508
01:06:24,146 --> 01:06:27,240
Learn how to drive, asshole!

1509
01:06:27,316 --> 01:06:30,217
Jesus Christ!

1510
01:06:30,286 --> 01:06:32,720
You know, we weren't
supposed to be on this RV.

1511
01:06:32,789 --> 01:06:34,586
We were supposed to get, uh-

1512
01:06:34,657 --> 01:06:36,887
We were supposed to get the bus
from String Cheese Incident,

1513
01:06:36,959 --> 01:06:39,553
their first that they took
to the Festeroo

1514
01:06:39,628 --> 01:06:40,993
for their first appearance.

1515
01:06:41,063 --> 01:06:42,394
It's called Bussy.

1516
01:06:42,465 --> 01:06:45,696
And I had it totally lined up,
but it broke down in Ojai.

1517
01:06:45,768 --> 01:06:48,328
So I had to just go
to EL Monte RV

1518
01:06:48,404 --> 01:06:50,895
and rent an RV
for the band

1519
01:06:50,973 --> 01:06:53,441
so we could take
this RV to Festeroo.

1520
01:06:53,509 --> 01:06:54,737
(huffs)

1521
01:06:54,810 --> 01:06:58,041
(honking)
Big fucking assholes!

1522
01:07:01,183 --> 01:07:02,775
Where do we go?
It's up here.

1523
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:05,286
Yeah, we gotta just
kind of cruise through
town a little bit.

1524
01:07:05,354 --> 01:07:07,549
But what's the road?
What's the turn?

1525
01:07:07,623 --> 01:07:09,181
What's the-
Is there a name?

1526
01:07:10,960 --> 01:07:12,723
Special event.

1527
01:07:12,795 --> 01:07:15,559
That's us, special event.

1528
01:07:15,631 --> 01:07:17,189
Is that it right there?

1529
01:07:17,266 --> 01:07:19,666
Yeah, this one up here,
this is the one.

1530
01:07:21,337 --> 01:07:23,771
(no audible dialogue)

1531
01:07:27,309 --> 01:07:28,742
All right, so here
we are at Festeroo.

1532
01:07:28,811 --> 01:07:30,301
We're getting
our credentials.

1533
01:07:30,379 --> 01:07:31,869
Really exciting.

1534
01:07:31,947 --> 01:07:33,505
We're checking in,
we're gonna start camping,

1535
01:07:33,582 --> 01:07:35,174
and we're going to
get ready for the gig.

1536
01:07:40,489 --> 01:07:41,888
This is a very
symbolic thing

1537
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:45,222
because the gates
of Festeroo here...

1538
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,818
We're here, guys.

1539
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,557
I know, dude.
Fucking...
We're here, man.

1540
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:50,462
Dude, how many times
have we been fucking jamming

1541
01:07:50,533 --> 01:07:52,524
and fucking doing
a freedom jam and going,

1542
01:07:52,601 --> 01:07:53,863
We're getting to
Festeroo one day, dude.

1543
01:07:53,936 --> 01:07:55,870
Oh, Lapdog.
Yeah?

1544
01:07:55,938 --> 01:07:58,805
We should get, uh...
tattoos!

1545
01:07:58,874 --> 01:08:01,240
Matching tattoos.
Electric Apricot.

1546
01:08:01,310 --> 01:08:02,902
You know, I've always
wanted to get a tattoo

1547
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,104
of a battleship
on my chest.

1548
01:08:04,180 --> 01:08:05,204
Aw, Christ.

1549
01:08:06,382 --> 01:08:07,940
Gordo.
Gordo. Hakia.

1550
01:08:08,017 --> 01:08:10,918
Remember they talked about
free love in the '60s?
Uh-huh.

1551
01:08:10,986 --> 01:08:14,183
This festival's totally
the same thing, like free love,

1552
01:08:14,256 --> 01:08:15,484
except for now
it's not free.

1553
01:08:15,558 --> 01:08:18,322
Like a guy like me,
I have no problem
getting chicks,

1554
01:08:18,394 --> 01:08:20,328
but it's cool guys like you
can come to this festival

1555
01:08:20,396 --> 01:08:21,328
and just score
chicks, man.

1556
01:08:21,397 --> 01:08:22,523
I just think that's
just fucking-

1557
01:08:22,598 --> 01:08:24,293
That's why I love
these places, man.

1558
01:08:24,366 --> 01:08:25,355
They're awesome.

1559
01:08:25,434 --> 01:08:27,595
We ain't got
no free love yet.

1560
01:08:27,670 --> 01:08:28,694
You have gotten any yet?

1561
01:08:28,771 --> 01:08:30,830
That's why you gotta
hang with us, dude.

1562
01:08:35,845 --> 01:08:37,813
I've never heard
of Electric Ay-pricot.

1563
01:08:37,880 --> 01:08:39,006
Actually, let me try again.

1564
01:08:39,081 --> 01:08:40,605
I've never heard
of Electric App-ricot.

1565
01:08:40,683 --> 01:08:41,843
I say App-ri.

1566
01:08:46,754 --> 01:08:49,552
Um...

1567
01:08:49,624 --> 01:08:51,114
Well, let's see,
first of all,

1568
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,627
they should lose
the food name.

1569
01:08:53,697 --> 01:08:55,688
That never works.

1570
01:08:55,764 --> 01:08:57,095
The Electric part is okay.

1571
01:08:57,166 --> 01:08:58,633
Well, this one, um-

1572
01:08:58,701 --> 01:09:00,362
Okay, so let's see.

1573
01:09:00,436 --> 01:09:03,837
The purple,
the combo Thursday,
which is the purple one,

1574
01:09:03,906 --> 01:09:05,305
was the late night
shows on Thursday.

1575
01:09:05,374 --> 01:09:06,966
The reason that I'm-

1576
01:09:07,042 --> 01:09:09,772
The one redeeming value
is the corn,

1577
01:09:09,845 --> 01:09:11,574
because it's better than
any other festival's corn,

1578
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:12,944
and I love that.

1579
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:13,947
Brought me here.

1580
01:09:14,016 --> 01:09:16,712
And the yellow one
is the combo Friday

1581
01:09:16,785 --> 01:09:18,013
for late night shows
on Friday.

1582
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,555
That's quite
an appealing,

1583
01:09:20,622 --> 01:09:22,453
evocative gaze,
if you ask me.

1584
01:09:22,525 --> 01:09:25,392
Good to know.

1585
01:09:25,461 --> 01:09:27,326
Not beer.

1586
01:09:27,396 --> 01:09:28,829
There are all types
at Festeroo.

1587
01:09:28,898 --> 01:09:31,458
All types: tall, big, small.

1588
01:09:31,534 --> 01:09:33,161
So, on that one side
of your mouth?
Yeah.

1589
01:09:33,235 --> 01:09:34,668
Okay.
Yeah, there you go.

1590
01:09:34,737 --> 01:09:35,829
Like this?

1591
01:09:35,905 --> 01:09:39,068
(screams into didgeridoo)

1592
01:09:39,141 --> 01:09:41,234
Yeah, that's...
that was closer.

1593
01:09:41,310 --> 01:09:44,302
(screaming into didgeridoo)

1594
01:09:44,380 --> 01:09:46,746
(coughing)

1595
01:09:46,815 --> 01:09:50,046
The combo, like,
I guess some kind

1596
01:09:50,119 --> 01:09:52,451
of weird pink color
was for Saturday.

1597
01:09:52,521 --> 01:09:55,422
And then I have
my combo Sunday,
which is orange.

1598
01:09:55,491 --> 01:09:57,356
So- I don't think
that's going to help, dude.

1599
01:09:57,426 --> 01:09:59,986
I can't eat stuff...
If it's stuffed,
I can't eat stuffed.

1600
01:10:00,062 --> 01:10:01,427
Sweet Potato?
I can't eat sweet.

1601
01:10:01,497 --> 01:10:02,930
Grilled?
Can't eat grilled.

1602
01:10:02,998 --> 01:10:04,022
Why can't you
eat grilled?

1603
01:10:04,099 --> 01:10:06,033
Caeser?
Can't eat Caeser.
Why?

1604
01:10:06,101 --> 01:10:08,092
Right now all I can eat
at this festival

1605
01:10:08,170 --> 01:10:10,161
is like, wheatgrass.

1606
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,867
So far I found one place
that sells wheatgrass

1607
01:10:12,942 --> 01:10:15,809
and there's one place
that sells these rocks

1608
01:10:15,878 --> 01:10:19,473
that you put in cinnamon
and you can lick them.

1609
01:10:21,083 --> 01:10:23,244
So I'm kinda hungry, dude.

1610
01:10:27,690 --> 01:10:29,749
The timber's off...

1611
01:10:29,825 --> 01:10:31,690
Wolf is running round

1612
01:10:31,760 --> 01:10:34,593
Winter was so hot and cold,
put him beneath the ground

1613
01:10:34,663 --> 01:10:38,599
No, don't kill me

1614
01:10:38,667 --> 01:10:42,159
No, don't kill me

1615
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:44,206
We are at Festeroo
and I had to step up.

1616
01:10:44,273 --> 01:10:47,265
I had to bust out the special
leopard skin glasses,

1617
01:10:47,343 --> 01:10:48,810
They aren't even
leopard skin anymore

1618
01:10:48,877 --> 01:10:50,105
because I've been
to Burning Man

1619
01:10:50,179 --> 01:10:52,875
so many times with these
that it's faded out.

1620
01:10:52,948 --> 01:10:54,108
See that guy
right over there?

1621
01:10:54,183 --> 01:10:57,414
The guy with the-
That's Matt Abts, man.

1622
01:10:57,486 --> 01:10:58,418
That's incredible.

1623
01:10:58,487 --> 01:10:59,886
I can't believe
he's even here.

1624
01:10:59,955 --> 01:11:01,946
That's incredible.

1625
01:11:02,024 --> 01:11:03,048
It's an honor
to meet you, man.

1626
01:11:03,125 --> 01:11:04,285
Oh, thank you, man.
Incredible.

1627
01:11:04,360 --> 01:11:07,056
I love the way you play
that Slingerland kit.

1628
01:11:07,129 --> 01:11:09,529
I like how you got
the tunings really open.

1629
01:11:09,598 --> 01:11:11,259
You're getting
all that ring,
that resonance.

1630
01:11:11,333 --> 01:11:13,301
Oh, yeah.
As much as I can.
I mean, that's just-

1631
01:11:15,004 --> 01:11:17,700
Warren fucking-
Warren fucking Haynes.

1632
01:11:17,773 --> 01:11:20,333
Warren fucking Haynes, dude.

1633
01:11:23,846 --> 01:11:25,609
You kind of got
the bottom thing going,

1634
01:11:25,681 --> 01:11:28,673
but I also see-
were you ever
into Cozy Powell?

1635
01:11:28,751 --> 01:11:29,945
I kind of get...
Love Cozy Powell.

1636
01:11:30,019 --> 01:11:31,008
I get, like,
a Cozy Powell...

1637
01:11:31,086 --> 01:11:32,610
The Jeff Beck stuff
he did especially.

1638
01:11:32,688 --> 01:11:35,987
I remember hearing him
with Rainbow

1639
01:11:36,058 --> 01:11:37,889
when Dio was singing
with Rainbow.

1640
01:11:37,960 --> 01:11:39,188
Yeah.
You know, Long Live
Rock 'n' Roll.

1641
01:11:39,261 --> 01:11:40,751
That was back when
I was kinda crazy,

1642
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,764
playing a lot of kind of
more heavier music, you know?

1643
01:11:43,832 --> 01:11:45,459
Excuse me, Warren?
Yes, sir.

1644
01:11:45,534 --> 01:11:47,092
Hey, how you doing?
Hey, man,
how you doing?

1645
01:11:47,169 --> 01:11:48,898
Steve Gordo Gordon
from Electric Apricot.

1646
01:11:48,971 --> 01:11:50,438
Nice to meet you Steve.
How do you do?

1647
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,666
I'm doing pretty good.

1648
01:11:51,740 --> 01:11:54,174
I'm a big, big fan.

1649
01:11:54,243 --> 01:11:55,210
Well, thank you.

1650
01:11:55,277 --> 01:11:56,437
Hey, you gotta second?

1651
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:57,740
Could ask you a couple
questions or something?

1652
01:11:57,812 --> 01:11:59,143
Sure, I got a second.

1653
01:11:59,214 --> 01:12:01,273
Phil Collins, I don't know
what happened to that guy.

1654
01:12:01,350 --> 01:12:02,874
I mean, he's such
a great drummer.

1655
01:12:02,951 --> 01:12:04,384
I don't know why
he started doing

1656
01:12:04,453 --> 01:12:06,387
all this cabaret,
Las Vegas-y thing.

1657
01:12:06,455 --> 01:12:08,753
Yeah, that's true.
Brand X, man.

1658
01:12:08,824 --> 01:12:10,382
Yeah.
That was a good band.

1659
01:12:10,459 --> 01:12:11,687
Yeah, I don't know
what happened.

1660
01:12:11,761 --> 01:12:12,785
He's got
cool hair, though.

1661
01:12:12,861 --> 01:12:14,726
Most people run their
pre-amp really hot,

1662
01:12:14,797 --> 01:12:16,492
and I don't run
mine very hot.
Uh-huh.

1663
01:12:16,565 --> 01:12:19,432
So it gives it
more bottom-end
at low pre-amp.

1664
01:12:19,501 --> 01:12:21,594
I-I see that, because you got
all the tone right there.

1665
01:12:21,670 --> 01:12:24,298
Thanks for taking
some time to talk to me.
Anytime.

1666
01:12:24,373 --> 01:12:26,807
I know you got a lot
of things to do, so...
It's quite all right.

1667
01:12:26,875 --> 01:12:28,604
Gordo?
You said it's Gordo?
Gordo.

1668
01:12:28,677 --> 01:12:30,235
It's nice
to meet you, Gordo.
Hey- Pleasure, pleasure.

1669
01:12:30,312 --> 01:12:32,280
My pleasure.
Hey, do you like
to go to the zoo?

1670
01:12:32,348 --> 01:12:34,179
Do you go to the zoo?
I don't go often, but-

1671
01:12:34,249 --> 01:12:36,046
Do you like to feed
the ducks in the park?

1672
01:12:36,118 --> 01:12:37,881
Uh, you know, I'm not
a big duck-feeder.

1673
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:40,820
I like ducks.
Yeah?
I can see that.

1674
01:12:40,889 --> 01:12:42,186
Yeah, yeah.

1675
01:12:42,257 --> 01:12:44,122
You can screw
my girlfriend
if you want to.

1676
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,820
She's totally down,
dude.
Yeah?

1677
01:12:45,894 --> 01:12:48,055
I probably would
feel too guilty.

1678
01:12:48,130 --> 01:12:49,791
I'm married and she's
your girlfriend, you know?

1679
01:12:49,865 --> 01:12:51,958
Oh, oh, okay.
All right.

1680
01:12:52,034 --> 01:12:53,331
But I appreciate the offer.

1681
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:56,200
I mean, it's probably-
it's coming from your heart

1682
01:12:56,271 --> 01:12:57,738
He was okay.

1683
01:12:57,805 --> 01:12:59,466
He was kinda weird, you know?

1684
01:12:59,541 --> 01:13:03,068
He offered me to sleep
with his girlfriend.

1685
01:13:03,145 --> 01:13:06,478
Something about ducks
and feeding ducks and-

1686
01:13:06,548 --> 01:13:09,278
I don't know.

1687
01:13:09,351 --> 01:13:11,546
Maybe he was a little high
or something.

1688
01:13:13,422 --> 01:13:15,413
Okay, I just was
a fucking total dipshit.

1689
01:13:15,491 --> 01:13:16,924
I think you're
overreacting.
Nah, dude.

1690
01:13:16,992 --> 01:13:18,323
I think you're
totally overreacting.
I'm not.

1691
01:13:18,394 --> 01:13:19,520
I was sitting there
telling him, dude,

1692
01:13:19,595 --> 01:13:21,495
he can sleep
with my girlfriend?

1693
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:22,928
Well-
What the fuck
is that, dude?

1694
01:13:22,998 --> 01:13:24,158
You don't even have
a girlfriend.

1695
01:13:24,233 --> 01:13:25,723
What the hell?
I'm trying
to tell you, dude.

1696
01:13:25,801 --> 01:13:28,201
Where the fuck
is that coming from?

1697
01:13:28,270 --> 01:13:30,135
Oh, man.
I don't think
it's as bad as you think.

1698
01:13:30,205 --> 01:13:32,036
No, it's the fucking
nightmare.

1699
01:13:32,107 --> 01:13:33,836
It's the worst thing
in my whole entire
fucking life.

1700
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,275
I got to meet Matt Abts.
It's supposed to be
the best day ever.

1701
01:13:36,345 --> 01:13:37,573
Feed the ducks.

1702
01:13:37,645 --> 01:13:38,873
What are you
talking about, ducks?

1703
01:13:38,947 --> 01:13:41,108
I asked him if he wanted
to go feed the fucking ducks!

1704
01:13:41,183 --> 01:13:43,242
What does that mean?
I don't know.

1705
01:13:43,318 --> 01:13:45,650
He was walking away,
I wanted to talk to him.

1706
01:13:45,721 --> 01:13:46,688
I didn't know
what to fucking...

1707
01:13:46,755 --> 01:13:47,881
So you talked
to him about ducks?

1708
01:13:47,956 --> 01:13:49,287
I just- I don't get it.
I mean...

1709
01:13:49,358 --> 01:13:50,552
I don't know
what to say, dude.

1710
01:13:50,626 --> 01:13:52,025
I didn't know
what to say, I just...

1711
01:13:52,094 --> 01:13:54,392
Fucking, I turned
into a blithering idiot

1712
01:13:54,463 --> 01:13:56,454
ass-fucking-hole.

1713
01:13:56,531 --> 01:13:58,829
It just kind of tripped
him out a little bit

1714
01:13:58,901 --> 01:14:01,233
that he told me
he felt like he made

1715
01:14:01,303 --> 01:14:04,761
an ass of himself
in front of Warren.

1716
01:14:04,840 --> 01:14:06,432
I'm just a fucking asshole.

1717
01:14:06,508 --> 01:14:08,066
Fucking fuck.

1718
01:14:12,414 --> 01:14:14,541
Oh, fuck it.

1719
01:14:16,452 --> 01:14:18,716
It was going so smooth today
and then he's gotta trip out.

1720
01:14:18,787 --> 01:14:20,414
Well, I mean,
you know, who knows?

1721
01:14:20,489 --> 01:14:21,421
Who knows what'll happen.

1722
01:14:21,490 --> 01:14:24,459
(psychedelic trance)

1723
01:14:35,838 --> 01:14:39,604
Wow, wow, wow.

1724
01:14:45,447 --> 01:14:47,972
(bottle tooting)

1725
01:14:51,253 --> 01:14:52,743
It's the old Cincinnati
dancing pig.

1726
01:14:52,821 --> 01:14:54,550
He's the barnyard Mr. Pig.

1727
01:15:46,775 --> 01:15:47,707
(rock in distance)

1728
01:15:47,776 --> 01:15:48,743
(crowd cheering)

1729
01:16:12,301 --> 01:16:14,098
Is anybody up yet?

1730
01:16:18,907 --> 01:16:20,499
I mean, you know,
he always disappears, man.

1731
01:16:20,576 --> 01:16:22,134
He's just... I'm not
really tripping on it.

1732
01:16:22,210 --> 01:16:24,144
He did get pretty hammered,
I'll tell you that right now.

1733
01:16:24,212 --> 01:16:25,440
He was definitely-

1734
01:16:25,514 --> 01:16:26,538
Yeah, I haven't-
I don't know.

1735
01:16:26,615 --> 01:16:28,480
I haven't seen him
that lit in a while.

1736
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:33,351
Well, he was all tripped out
because he went up to-

1737
01:16:33,422 --> 01:16:34,514
he went up to Warren Haynes

1738
01:16:34,590 --> 01:16:35,852
and just said
all this crazy shit.

1739
01:16:35,924 --> 01:16:38,552
But the camera guys said
that they stumbled across him

1740
01:16:38,628 --> 01:16:40,391
and he was passed out
and he was nude.

1741
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:42,987
Hah, that's such...
That's Gordo.

1742
01:16:43,065 --> 01:16:44,623
It's cool, dude.
We got a lot of time.

1743
01:16:44,700 --> 01:16:46,327
He'll show up.
He always shows up.

1744
01:16:46,401 --> 01:16:51,361
I, uh... I think that
Festeroo is a festering...

1745
01:16:51,440 --> 01:16:55,843
not a disease-ridden
kangaroo,

1746
01:16:55,911 --> 01:16:59,039
but an ocean of creativity

1747
01:16:59,114 --> 01:17:01,674
and some of the Lord's
own jelly.

1748
01:17:01,750 --> 01:17:03,945
Check it, stop, rock

1749
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:05,850
Everybody gonna move

1750
01:17:05,921 --> 01:17:07,980
Everybody, let's move

1751
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:10,616
(Let's move)
Everybody gonna move

1752
01:17:10,693 --> 01:17:13,423
Everybody, let's move
(Come on)

1753
01:17:13,495 --> 01:17:15,019
Ah, yes.

1754
01:17:15,097 --> 01:17:16,997
Ain't gonna stop
(And you don't stop)

1755
01:17:17,065 --> 01:17:18,498
Ain't gonna quit

1756
01:17:18,567 --> 01:17:22,367
I've kind of evolved,
revolved, and dissolved

1757
01:17:22,437 --> 01:17:24,029
with the Grateful Dead.

1758
01:17:24,106 --> 01:17:28,167
And so, uh,
jam is my middle jelly.

1759
01:17:28,243 --> 01:17:31,303
You know, fun is fun
and we all know how he is,

1760
01:17:31,380 --> 01:17:33,439
but this is- this is...
this is kinda crazy, guys.

1761
01:17:33,515 --> 01:17:36,609
We might have to
do it without him,
I hate to say it.

1762
01:17:36,685 --> 01:17:38,152
(Aiwass)
We're going to have
to do it without him.

1763
01:17:38,220 --> 01:17:39,983
What's the word, here?
You guys-

1764
01:17:40,055 --> 01:17:42,023
(Lapdog)
What's the word with you?

1765
01:17:42,090 --> 01:17:43,421
Nothing.

1766
01:17:43,492 --> 01:17:44,686
I goose-egged.
I haven't found a thing.

1767
01:17:44,760 --> 01:17:46,022
We're going to have
to play, man.

1768
01:17:46,094 --> 01:17:47,493
We're just going
to have to do it.

1769
01:17:47,562 --> 01:17:49,359
What do you think?
Should we, like-

1770
01:17:49,431 --> 01:17:53,231
Well, I think, you know...
Extended solos or should you
do your drum solos?

1771
01:17:53,301 --> 01:17:54,734
Hey, or I can do
a drum solo.

1772
01:17:54,803 --> 01:17:57,067
I can get bass solos, man.
I can do some stuff.

1773
01:17:57,139 --> 01:17:58,697
I can't believe this.

1774
01:17:58,707 --> 01:17:58,934
I can't believe this.

1775
01:17:59,007 --> 01:18:00,201
We're down to the wire.

1776
01:18:00,275 --> 01:18:01,503
This is it,
this is the wire.

1777
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,601
All right, guys,
we gotta do it.

1778
01:18:03,678 --> 01:18:06,442
Coming out for you,
the seminal Jam band,

1779
01:18:06,515 --> 01:18:08,107
bursting onto
the Jam band scene,

1780
01:18:08,183 --> 01:18:10,674
enlightening the world
through music,

1781
01:18:10,752 --> 01:18:13,812
give it up for Electric
Apricot, everyone!

1782
01:18:13,889 --> 01:18:15,117
Get on your feet!

1783
01:18:15,190 --> 01:18:16,953
Get ready to dance!

1784
01:18:17,025 --> 01:18:19,255
(cheering)

1785
01:18:19,327 --> 01:18:23,661
(Lapdog)
A quarter of the Apricot
entity was not there.

1786
01:18:23,732 --> 01:18:25,666
Here we were
heading out on stage.

1787
01:18:25,734 --> 01:18:28,897
And we started getting into
some of the Burning Man,

1788
01:18:28,970 --> 01:18:30,369
the textures,
doing these textures,

1789
01:18:30,439 --> 01:18:32,100
you know?

1790
01:18:32,174 --> 01:18:35,143
(Jam)

1791
01:18:40,849 --> 01:18:42,476
The feeling you get,
you know,

1792
01:18:42,551 --> 01:18:46,317
just the energy that comes off
of that mass of humanity,

1793
01:18:46,388 --> 01:18:48,720
it's like, you know-

1794
01:18:48,790 --> 01:18:51,588
it's why I do what I do.

1795
01:18:51,660 --> 01:18:56,996
It's why I chose
to be a percussionist
singer/songwriter,

1796
01:18:57,065 --> 01:18:59,033
whatever you want
to call it.

1797
01:19:09,778 --> 01:19:12,611
Next thing I know,
I look over and there he is,

1798
01:19:12,681 --> 01:19:13,613
kinda shambling out.

1799
01:19:13,682 --> 01:19:14,808
I was a little late.

1800
01:19:14,883 --> 01:19:17,408
I was working
some stuff out.

1801
01:19:17,486 --> 01:19:21,445
I knew, personally, that Gordo
was going to show up.

1802
01:19:21,523 --> 01:19:24,151
(Lapdog, echoing)
There's a place...

1803
01:19:24,226 --> 01:19:28,253
a wondrous,
magical place

1804
01:19:28,330 --> 01:19:30,730
where like-minded
individuals

1805
01:19:30,800 --> 01:19:34,827
come together on the playa.

1806
01:19:34,903 --> 01:19:38,737
This place,
this wondrous place,

1807
01:19:38,808 --> 01:19:40,605
is called...

1808
01:19:41,810 --> 01:19:46,008
Burning Man

1809
01:19:47,382 --> 01:19:51,614
Burning Man

1810
01:19:51,686 --> 01:19:54,985
I think the fans and our band
really connected today.

1811
01:19:55,056 --> 01:19:56,182
It felt really magical to me.

1812
01:19:56,258 --> 01:19:57,850
I don't know, it really
felt like we clicked.

1813
01:19:57,926 --> 01:20:02,124
I mean, it was like,
here's me, here's the band.

1814
01:20:02,197 --> 01:20:03,357
We kinda just came together.

1815
01:20:03,431 --> 01:20:07,527
Hey, are you going
to Burning Man?

1816
01:20:07,601 --> 01:20:10,661
Bury your toes
in the desert sand

1817
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:14,573
Ain't no man for
to tell you how to be

1818
01:20:14,643 --> 01:20:17,009
(Be)

1819
01:20:17,078 --> 01:20:20,343
Come on down with me
to Burning Man

1820
01:20:20,415 --> 01:20:23,384
I got a recipe
for cosmic flan

1821
01:20:23,451 --> 01:20:27,353
Strip off your clothes
and set your aura free

1822
01:20:27,422 --> 01:20:29,549
(Free)

1823
01:20:29,624 --> 01:20:34,186
Gordo, today,
played his ass off,
if I may say so.

1824
01:20:34,262 --> 01:20:36,753
He was singing
something electric
with his guitar

1825
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,993
that I hadn't-
actually have never
ever seen before.

1826
01:21:10,232 --> 01:21:13,463
Come down with me
to Burning Man

1827
01:21:13,534 --> 01:21:16,526
Dangle your toes
in that desert sand

1828
01:21:16,604 --> 01:21:19,903
Ain't no man for
to tell you how to be

1829
01:21:19,975 --> 01:21:22,773
And by the man,
I mean the law.

1830
01:21:22,844 --> 01:21:26,177
Free people taking
Burning Man.

1831
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,376
Amazing Larry's
got a masterplan.

1832
01:21:29,451 --> 01:21:30,509
It's all about

1833
01:21:30,584 --> 01:21:35,578
Just letting
myself be free

1834
01:21:37,392 --> 01:21:40,156
We went to a place that was
absolutely unbelievable.

1835
01:21:40,228 --> 01:21:41,855
People were staring at us,
they were staring at me.

1836
01:21:41,930 --> 01:21:43,921
Hey, touchdown, payday.

1837
01:21:43,999 --> 01:21:46,729
I don't want to say payday
because that's a little more
of a capitalistic thing.

1838
01:21:46,801 --> 01:21:49,793
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1839
01:21:49,871 --> 01:21:52,339
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1840
01:21:52,407 --> 01:21:55,240
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1841
01:21:55,310 --> 01:21:58,507
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1842
01:22:37,118 --> 01:22:39,951
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?

1843
01:22:40,021 --> 01:22:42,785
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1844
01:22:42,857 --> 01:22:45,485
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1845
01:22:45,561 --> 01:22:48,155
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1846
01:22:48,229 --> 01:22:51,426
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1847
01:22:51,499 --> 01:22:54,297
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1848
01:22:54,369 --> 01:22:56,894
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1849
01:22:56,972 --> 01:22:59,463
Hey, are you goin' to-

1850
01:22:59,540 --> 01:23:02,668
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1851
01:23:02,744 --> 01:23:05,542
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1852
01:23:05,613 --> 01:23:08,446
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1853
01:23:08,516 --> 01:23:12,043
Hey, are you goin'
to Burning Man?
(Burning Man)

1854
01:23:12,120 --> 01:23:13,678
(cheering)

1855
01:23:13,755 --> 01:23:16,781
How you doing?
How you feeling?

1856
01:23:16,858 --> 01:23:17,847
(Gordo)
It was good.

1857
01:23:17,926 --> 01:23:19,154
Everyone played
really, really well.

1858
01:23:19,227 --> 01:23:20,159
I was really impressed.

1859
01:23:20,228 --> 01:23:22,287
Gordo was just amazing,
Lap was amazing,

1860
01:23:22,364 --> 01:23:23,388
Herschel, I mean-

1861
01:23:23,465 --> 01:23:24,864
I was proud to be
in this band today.

1862
01:23:24,933 --> 01:23:27,060
We came, we saw, we conquered.

1863
01:23:27,135 --> 01:23:28,397
Why not have a little fun?

1864
01:23:28,470 --> 01:23:31,769
I think from here onward
and upward for the Apricot.

1865
01:23:31,840 --> 01:23:34,035
I turned and looked
and there was Gordo, man.

1866
01:23:34,109 --> 01:23:36,805
You only rock Festeroo once,
you know what I'm saying?

1867
01:23:36,878 --> 01:23:39,676
Gordo, we were ready to go on
with a three-piece, man.

1868
01:23:39,748 --> 01:23:42,774
I want to propose a toast,
a toast to us at Festeroo.

1869
01:23:42,851 --> 01:23:44,614
Sweet!
Yeah, yeah!

1870
01:23:44,686 --> 01:23:46,313
Hip, hip, hooray!

1871
01:23:46,388 --> 01:23:47,650
(Don)
What a day, man.
Festeroo.

1872
01:23:47,722 --> 01:23:51,522
We came, we saw,
we pulled it off somehow,

1873
01:23:51,593 --> 01:23:54,790
and, uh... yeah, wow.

1874
01:23:54,863 --> 01:23:56,956
My head's kinda spun
from the whole-

1875
01:23:57,032 --> 01:23:57,999
the whole thing, you know?

1876
01:23:58,066 --> 01:23:59,363
(Lapdog)
So what happened
to you, dude?

1877
01:23:59,434 --> 01:24:01,163
I was...
I was in the woods

1878
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:04,433
and I was sleeping
and I was naked.

1879
01:24:04,506 --> 01:24:08,408
I was woken up
by this voice.

1880
01:24:08,476 --> 01:24:13,436
I looked up, you guys,
and Jerry was standing over me.

1881
01:24:13,515 --> 01:24:15,005
Jerry.

1882
01:24:15,083 --> 01:24:16,380
He came to me.

1883
01:24:16,451 --> 01:24:18,681
He's been so fixated
on Jerry Garcia

1884
01:24:18,753 --> 01:24:20,914
for so many years, I guess
it was bound to happen.

1885
01:24:20,989 --> 01:24:22,456
Whether or not
it's real or not...

1886
01:24:22,524 --> 01:24:23,821
I mean, he didn't
see Jerry Garcia.

1887
01:24:23,892 --> 01:24:25,086
He was probably
talking to a squirrel.

1888
01:24:25,160 --> 01:24:29,119
I think he wanted
to see Jerry Garcia.

1889
01:24:29,197 --> 01:24:31,358
And he's talking to me,
but his mouth isn't moving.

1890
01:24:31,433 --> 01:24:33,264
Jerry was?
With Jerry?

1891
01:24:33,334 --> 01:24:34,767
What the hell are you
talking about?
But, dude...

1892
01:24:34,836 --> 01:24:38,135
I'll tell you what.
I'll tell you what.

1893
01:24:38,206 --> 01:24:40,333
I've never seen you play
like you played today.

1894
01:24:40,408 --> 01:24:42,035
I've never seen that.
That was incredible.

1895
01:24:42,110 --> 01:24:43,372
Yeah, dude,
you saved the show.

1896
01:24:43,445 --> 01:24:45,003
I really think you did.
We've been
around the horn.

1897
01:24:45,080 --> 01:24:47,173
He was talking to me
through here and here.

1898
01:24:47,248 --> 01:24:49,273
Just the most spiritual thing
that ever happened to me

1899
01:24:49,350 --> 01:24:50,840
in my whole entire life, man.

1900
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:53,911
There's a tray
of special brownies,
if you know what I mean,

1901
01:24:53,988 --> 01:24:57,389
waiting for us in the rig,
if anybody wants them.

1902
01:24:57,459 --> 01:24:59,086
Oh, oh, oh!

1903
01:24:59,160 --> 01:25:01,560
The Cube... you know,
he's one of our biggest fans-

1904
01:25:01,629 --> 01:25:03,028
and he brought us
a tray of brownies.

1905
01:25:03,098 --> 01:25:04,827
You know,
those happy brownies.

1906
01:25:04,899 --> 01:25:07,459
Hey, our work is done.

1907
01:25:07,535 --> 01:25:09,127
(laughs)

1908
01:25:09,204 --> 01:25:11,331
Let's have a little fun!
So ready, man.

1909
01:25:11,406 --> 01:25:14,068
You guys better get in
while you fit in

1910
01:25:14,142 --> 01:25:17,339
because if I get that tray,
it's gonna be gone, man.

1911
01:25:17,412 --> 01:25:18,879
We have to get
out of here tonight

1912
01:25:18,947 --> 01:25:22,815
because we have
to get this RV back.

1913
01:25:22,884 --> 01:25:24,977
Otherwise we'll have to
pay another day rental.

1914
01:25:24,986 --> 01:25:25,315
Otherwise we'll have to
pay another day rental.

1915
01:25:25,386 --> 01:25:28,253
(Narrator)
In the process of
documenting Electric Apricot,

1916
01:25:28,323 --> 01:25:30,814
our young filmmaker
has caught a glimpse
of Enlightenment.

1917
01:25:30,892 --> 01:25:32,792
(Lapdog)
Oh, I got it.
I got it. We're cool.

1918
01:25:32,861 --> 01:25:35,796
Yeah, this is cool
right here.

1919
01:25:35,864 --> 01:25:39,630
So, what happened
to those brownies?

1920
01:25:39,701 --> 01:25:40,963
(Don)
Gordo ate them.

1921
01:25:41,035 --> 01:25:42,832
Dude, he ate
all those brownies?

1922
01:25:42,904 --> 01:25:44,929
(Narrator)
The true revelation
of Enlightenment

1923
01:25:45,006 --> 01:25:47,770
is the discovery that life
is a never-ending journey

1924
01:25:47,842 --> 01:25:50,436
to a destination that
is never actually reached.

1925
01:25:50,512 --> 01:25:53,572
Are you sure, man?

1926
01:25:53,648 --> 01:25:54,945
He's going to be
totally gone.

1927
01:25:55,016 --> 01:25:56,415
(Don)
Yeah, he is gone.
He's passed out.

1928
01:25:56,484 --> 01:25:57,678
(Narrator)
Unexpectedly,

1929
01:25:57,752 --> 01:25:59,583
while reaching
for Enlightenment,

1930
01:25:59,654 --> 01:26:01,884
the duality of existence
is unveiled.

1931
01:26:01,956 --> 01:26:04,254
He's going to have
a very special ride
when he wakes up.

1932
01:26:04,325 --> 01:26:06,520
(police radio chatter)

1933
01:26:12,000 --> 01:26:13,228
How you doing tonight, sir?

1934
01:26:13,301 --> 01:26:15,166
I'm doing all right, Officer.
Doing all right.

1935
01:26:15,236 --> 01:26:16,294
Where are you coming from?

1936
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:18,703
We just came
from the Festeroo,

1937
01:26:18,773 --> 01:26:20,741
a festival down the road.

1938
01:26:20,808 --> 01:26:22,207
Sir, I am going
to have to ask you

1939
01:26:22,277 --> 01:26:24,404
to put that video camera
down, please.

1940
01:26:24,479 --> 01:26:27,243
Driver's license
and registration, please.

1941
01:26:27,315 --> 01:26:28,577
You know,
they're making a-

1942
01:26:28,650 --> 01:26:30,015
they're making a documen-

1943
01:26:30,084 --> 01:26:31,551
We just played the Festeroo
down the street.

1944
01:26:31,619 --> 01:26:33,143
Sir, please turn
that video camera off.

1945
01:26:33,221 --> 01:26:34,449
They're making
a documentary.

1946
01:26:34,522 --> 01:26:35,489
They're making
a documentary.

1947
01:26:35,557 --> 01:26:36,615
That's what
the cameras are for.

1948
01:26:36,692 --> 01:26:38,523
They're doing
a documentary
on the band.

1949
01:26:38,593 --> 01:26:40,959
Driver's license
and registration, please.
We're a band from California.

1950
01:26:41,029 --> 01:26:42,223
(Gordo)
What's going on?
We play on...

1951
01:26:42,297 --> 01:26:44,197
You mind if I come in there
and check it out?

1952
01:26:44,265 --> 01:26:45,960
Um...
Check out inside.

1953
01:26:46,034 --> 01:26:47,763
Turn that video camera
off now.
(Gordo)
What?

1954
01:26:47,835 --> 01:26:49,029
Man, I'm getting
out of here!

1955
01:26:49,103 --> 01:26:50,297
Get me outta here!
(jostling door handle)

1956
01:26:50,371 --> 01:26:52,601
(Don)
Gordo, stop, dude.
I said... God damn!

1957
01:26:52,674 --> 01:26:53,641
(door bursts open)

1958
01:26:56,612 --> 01:26:59,581
Get your hands off me.
Hey! Get over here!

1959
01:26:59,647 --> 01:27:01,046
It's cool man!

1960
01:27:01,115 --> 01:27:02,582
It's cool, man.
It's cool.

1961
01:27:02,650 --> 01:27:04,413
Hands behind your back.
It's cool.
It's cool, man.

1962
01:27:04,485 --> 01:27:05,850
I can't...
I can't breathe.

1963
01:27:05,920 --> 01:27:07,751
Shut up and stay there.
I can't breathe!

1964
01:27:07,822 --> 01:27:11,883
l... Jerry! Jerry!
Jerry!

1965
01:27:49,998 --> 01:27:52,933
Gordo recently
started a website

1966
01:27:53,001 --> 01:27:54,866
dedicated to the notion
that Jerry Garcia

1967
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:56,130
is still alive.

1968
01:27:56,204 --> 01:27:57,967
I don't put much stock
in this sort of thing,

1969
01:27:58,039 --> 01:27:59,666
but I did find something
pretty interesting.

1970
01:27:59,741 --> 01:28:04,337
I thought I just...
one of these pans
I had backstage.

1971
01:28:04,412 --> 01:28:07,404
I'll scroll back here.

1972
01:28:11,986 --> 01:28:14,921
If you do
a frame-by-frame...

1973
01:28:16,424 --> 01:28:19,052
Look at that.

1974
01:28:19,127 --> 01:28:21,288
I'll do a zoom-in.

1975
01:28:23,798 --> 01:28:25,663
I mean, I don't know.

1976
01:28:29,237 --> 01:28:30,534
You tell me.

1977
01:28:32,140 --> 01:28:35,166
Hey, are you going
to Burning Man?

1978
01:28:35,243 --> 01:28:38,701
Bury your toes
in the desert sand

1979
01:28:38,780 --> 01:28:42,648
Ain't no man for
to tell you how to be

1980
01:28:42,717 --> 01:28:44,981
(Be)

1981
01:28:45,053 --> 01:28:48,181
Come on down with me
to Burning Man

1982
01:28:48,256 --> 01:28:51,248
I got a recipe
for cosmic flan

1983
01:28:51,326 --> 01:28:55,353
Strip off your clothes
and set your aura free

1984
01:28:55,430 --> 01:29:00,458
(Free)

1985
01:29:00,535 --> 01:29:03,936
There's a place I know
called Black Rock City

1986
01:29:04,005 --> 01:29:05,734
Where we're
about to get down

1987
01:29:05,807 --> 01:29:07,832
To the nitty gritty

1988
01:29:07,909 --> 01:29:10,901
We're all children
of the stars above

1989
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:17,645
Searching for answers
and feasting on love

1990
01:29:17,719 --> 01:29:21,052
Hey, are you going
to Burning Man?

1991
01:29:21,122 --> 01:29:24,023
I got a big old slab
of veggie ham

1992
01:29:24,092 --> 01:29:27,323
Come to Camp Tesori
and to bring some soy

1993
01:29:27,395 --> 01:29:30,421
Cheese
(Cheese)

1994
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:33,626
Free-thinking people
at Burning Man

1995
01:29:33,701 --> 01:29:36,898
Amazing Larry's
got the masterplan

1996
01:29:36,971 --> 01:29:41,203
It's all about just
letting myself be me

1997
01:29:41,275 --> 01:29:44,335
Me
(Me)

1998
01:29:46,247 --> 01:29:49,808
There's a gal I know
called Moonstone Annie

1999
01:29:49,884 --> 01:29:53,217
She blows flames
right out of her fanny

2000
01:29:53,287 --> 01:29:56,154
Ya ought to see her
walking on the tight wire

2001
01:29:56,224 --> 01:30:00,285
Jugglin' bananas
while her hair is on fire

2002
01:30:00,361 --> 01:30:02,625
(Fire)

2003
01:30:02,697 --> 01:30:05,393
(electric guitar solo)

2004
01:30:42,303 --> 01:30:44,464
(piano)

2005
01:31:20,074 --> 01:31:21,439
(Ooh)
(spoken)
Come on down with me

2006
01:31:21,509 --> 01:31:23,704
to Burnin' Man...

2007
01:31:23,778 --> 01:31:26,713
It's a fabulous place.
It's a fabulous land.

2008
01:31:26,780 --> 01:31:30,011
(Ooh,) ooh
(Ooh,) yeah.

2009
01:31:33,554 --> 01:31:37,007
Art love, lovin' Art's love
