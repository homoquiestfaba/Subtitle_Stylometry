You can stay the fuck out
there, I'm not scared of you.

189
00:22:58,392 --> 00:23:00,795
[demon roars]

190
00:23:07,500 --> 00:23:11,506
Well, I'm feeling
mighty proud of myself.

191
00:23:12,707 --> 00:23:14,542
What time does it
say on that clock?

192
00:23:16,343 --> 00:23:20,048
I managed to get rid of this
one in less than 20 minutes?

193
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,250
I'm getting good at this shit.

194
00:23:22,282 --> 00:23:24,184
I don't do this professionally.

195
00:23:34,494 --> 00:23:36,930
Caffeine-free diet soda?

196
00:23:36,963 --> 00:23:39,867
Why don't I just drink the
juice from that jar of pickles?

197
00:24:02,757 --> 00:24:04,426
Oh, fucking pickles.

198
00:24:08,461 --> 00:24:09,864
Gift from God.

199
00:24:34,454 --> 00:24:35,289
Hmm.

200
00:24:36,856 --> 00:24:39,126
What the fuck is with this shit?

201
00:24:46,500 --> 00:24:51,005
Who is having shit sent
to my house? [sighs]

202
00:25:03,049 --> 00:25:05,019
And this bullshit.

203
00:25:05,051 --> 00:25:08,055
[chip bag crinkles]

204
00:25:11,724 --> 00:25:14,596
Why couldn't I have a
demon on a diet, dammit.

205
00:25:18,265 --> 00:25:19,567
Where is that book?

206
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:31,312
Oh, thank God something's
where I left it.

207
00:25:41,188 --> 00:25:44,425
Now, what [sighs]
was I dealing with?

208
00:25:47,560 --> 00:25:50,063
Or what ass did I
kick out of here?

209
00:26:00,641 --> 00:26:01,442
No.

210
00:26:02,843 --> 00:26:07,582
What's this about a... a
demon that turns into a cat?

211
00:26:07,615 --> 00:26:12,620
That white cat, that little
sweet, white cat is not a demon.

212
00:26:15,890 --> 00:26:16,891
Well, you know what?

213
00:26:18,659 --> 00:26:19,494
Hmm.

214
00:26:21,895 --> 00:26:23,865
Wait, this could be my guy.

215
00:26:25,031 --> 00:26:29,971
"From the list of lesser
known demons, Malichi,

216
00:26:31,404 --> 00:26:34,942
he is a demon known to torment
persons by causing disarray.

217
00:26:34,974 --> 00:26:37,344
A frequent technique he uses is

218
00:26:37,377 --> 00:26:39,547
to move objects in an attempt

219
00:26:39,579 --> 00:26:42,215
to make the living believe
they are going insane."

220
00:26:42,249 --> 00:26:45,385
Well, every room I walk
into shifts someplace else,

221
00:26:45,419 --> 00:26:48,923
and look, talk about
disarray. [sighs]

222
00:26:52,792 --> 00:26:55,495
You know, that also
explains the cat,

223
00:26:55,528 --> 00:27:00,201
'cause I don't have a cat, but
there's a cat here. [sighs]

224
00:27:00,233 --> 00:27:03,169
He placed it here to
make me think I'm nuts.

225
00:27:03,202 --> 00:27:06,039
And the dog beds, I
don't have fucking dogs.

226
00:27:07,708 --> 00:27:12,714
It also says, "his face is
gray and ashen," which it was,

227
00:27:13,881 --> 00:27:15,850
"with elongated
arms that he uses

228
00:27:15,883 --> 00:27:19,252
to walk with in
a staggered gait.

229
00:27:19,286 --> 00:27:21,355
He is driven away
when his attempts

230
00:27:21,387 --> 00:27:24,791
to frighten mortals
are unsuccessful."

231
00:27:24,825 --> 00:27:27,961
Well, he didn't scare...
well, he kind of did scare me,

232
00:27:27,994 --> 00:27:31,164
but he wasn't getting what
he wanted, so he left.

233
00:27:32,566 --> 00:27:37,505
"He considers ghosts allies
and often congregates with him.

234
00:27:38,872 --> 00:27:43,878
Following his departure,
paranormal events often increase

235
00:27:45,211 --> 00:27:46,847
if ghosts are present

236
00:27:48,882 --> 00:27:52,086
because they yearn for
Malichi's"... I don't know

237
00:27:52,118 --> 00:27:54,422
if that, I'm even
pronouncing that right.

238
00:27:54,454 --> 00:27:57,191
"But they yearn for
Malichi's presence

239
00:27:57,223 --> 00:27:59,393
and consider anyone responsible

240
00:27:59,425 --> 00:28:03,298
for his departure a
target for physical harm.

241
00:28:04,765 --> 00:28:09,704
Beware of what comes after the
departure of the demon," ooh.

242
00:28:11,672 --> 00:28:13,341
"Also, be cognizant

243
00:28:13,374 --> 00:28:17,444
that Malichi's leaving
often signals the arrival

244
00:28:17,478 --> 00:28:22,283
of demons more powerful
and malevolent.

245
00:28:22,316 --> 00:28:25,486
The ghost will attack
those that will not leave,

246
00:28:25,519 --> 00:28:28,990
and those attacks will
increase in intensity

247
00:28:29,022 --> 00:28:32,158
and become more
and more dangerous.

248
00:28:32,192 --> 00:28:35,930
If they eventually rejoin
with a demonic force,

249
00:28:35,962 --> 00:28:39,733
it is likely their attacks
will be life threatening."

250
00:28:43,303 --> 00:28:46,507
Well, I don't get the
feeling there's anything else

251
00:28:46,539 --> 00:28:48,041
in this house, so.

252
00:28:50,810 --> 00:28:51,678
He's gone.

253
00:28:58,352 --> 00:29:02,189
Yeah, see, stuff in here was
moved every time I walked back

254
00:29:02,221 --> 00:29:05,225
into this room, like
that wasn't there.

255
00:29:05,259 --> 00:29:07,761
The phone was there 'cause
I ripped it off the wall,

256
00:29:07,795 --> 00:29:09,764
but stuff's moved everywhere.

257
00:29:18,739 --> 00:29:20,173
[phone rings]

258
00:29:20,207 --> 00:29:22,477
Jesus Christ, it's the
fucking loudest phone.

259
00:29:24,044 --> 00:29:24,878
Hello?

260
00:29:25,979 --> 00:29:30,817
I told you, no one
lives here by that name!

261
00:29:34,288 --> 00:29:35,823
[phone rings]

262
00:29:35,855 --> 00:29:40,661
[background noise
drowns out speaker]

263
00:29:40,693 --> 00:29:43,696
[phone rings]

264
00:29:43,730 --> 00:29:45,500
How is that possible?

265
00:29:46,834 --> 00:29:49,336
[phone rings]

266
00:29:57,478 --> 00:29:58,278
[child laughs]

267
00:29:58,311 --> 00:29:59,146
Hello?

268
00:30:04,550 --> 00:30:06,887
[Tom sighs]

269
00:30:17,498 --> 00:30:22,503
Well, was this before or
after I banished its ass?

270
00:30:26,507 --> 00:30:28,842
[Tom sighs]

271
00:30:31,912 --> 00:30:34,682
[chair clatters]

272
00:30:37,550 --> 00:30:40,020
[door creaks]

273
00:30:44,724 --> 00:30:47,227
[Tom sighs]

274
00:30:47,260 --> 00:30:49,730
So much for a little reprieve.

275
00:31:13,921 --> 00:31:16,757
Let's see what the fuck's
going on down here.

276
00:31:21,795 --> 00:31:23,797
[light switch clicks]

277
00:31:23,829 --> 00:31:25,198
What the fuck,

278
00:31:25,231 --> 00:31:27,634
the lights don't... of
course the lights don't work.

279
00:31:29,269 --> 00:31:30,871
[baby cries]

280
00:31:30,903 --> 00:31:32,673
Is that a baby crying?

281
00:31:47,753 --> 00:31:50,156
[light switch clicks]

282
00:31:50,190 --> 00:31:53,527
Great, another freaking
light that doesn't work.

283
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:55,929
[baby cries]

284
00:32:10,042 --> 00:32:13,380
That's definitely
coming from over here.

285
00:32:44,111 --> 00:32:45,079
Oh, that's cute.

286
00:32:45,112 --> 00:32:47,081
[baby screams]

287
00:32:47,114 --> 00:32:51,518
What the fuck, I can't... ow.
[furniture clatters]

288
00:32:51,550 --> 00:32:54,989
I can't see.
[banging echoes]

289
00:32:55,021 --> 00:32:57,490
[baby laughs]

290
00:32:59,159 --> 00:33:01,562
How do I get the
fuck out of here?

291
00:33:01,595 --> 00:33:04,565
Here we go, here we go. [pants]

292
00:33:13,240 --> 00:33:15,576
[Tom sighs]

293
00:33:21,480 --> 00:33:24,852
I don't know what the fuck
that is in the basement,

294
00:33:24,884 --> 00:33:26,753
but I need to get
my bearings together

295
00:33:26,787 --> 00:33:28,655
before I start
dealing with that.

296
00:33:30,123 --> 00:33:33,294
What, what the fuck
is that out there?

297
00:33:41,000 --> 00:33:42,435
The fuck is that?

298
00:33:48,240 --> 00:33:49,175
Let me get.

299
00:33:56,415 --> 00:33:57,884
Oh, I'll use this.

300
00:34:23,744 --> 00:34:26,380
I can't see with the lights on.

301
00:34:27,547 --> 00:34:30,951
There's something
out there, somebody.

302
00:34:30,983 --> 00:34:34,087
What the fuck else
could be going on?

303
00:34:47,400 --> 00:34:49,036
Oh, this is fucking beautiful.

304
00:34:53,139 --> 00:34:54,974
What the fuck is he doing?

305
00:34:57,643 --> 00:34:59,012
Wait, where'd he go?

306
00:35:01,581 --> 00:35:03,317
Where the fuck did he...

307
00:35:08,454 --> 00:35:11,057
Oh, I can't see shit out there.

308
00:35:14,860 --> 00:35:17,463
[demon roars]

309
00:35:17,496 --> 00:35:20,100
[floor creaks]

310
00:35:24,103 --> 00:35:26,873
Well, I don't know
where he went,

311
00:35:28,307 --> 00:35:33,313
or it went, but it's
outside, so. [sighs]

312
00:35:35,916 --> 00:35:37,952
That's where it needs to stay.

313
00:35:42,922 --> 00:35:46,125
So the obvious question

314
00:35:46,159 --> 00:35:49,596
whoever's watching
this will be asking is,

315
00:35:49,628 --> 00:35:53,400
why does this guy
record everything

316
00:35:53,432 --> 00:35:55,568
that goes on in his life?

317
00:35:55,601 --> 00:35:59,272
Well, people that have seen
the previous recordings think

318
00:35:59,306 --> 00:36:01,876
I'm nuts for staying
here, which I probably am.

319
00:36:03,175 --> 00:36:06,480
But people that don't,
and I tell this to,

320
00:36:06,512 --> 00:36:09,482
think I'm nuts, which
is why I record it,

321
00:36:09,516 --> 00:36:12,719
specifically on a camera
that I don't even know

322
00:36:12,751 --> 00:36:16,824
where it came from, but
it's here, so I'm using it.

323
00:36:16,856 --> 00:36:19,860
I don't know where half the
stuff in this house came from,

324
00:36:19,893 --> 00:36:22,663
the cat, the dogs
I haven't seen,

325
00:36:22,695 --> 00:36:24,964
but there's dog beds
and toys everywhere

326
00:36:24,998 --> 00:36:28,601
and dog biscuits on top
of the refrigerator.

327
00:36:28,635 --> 00:36:32,873
I... [sighs] this
one's got me baffled.

328
00:36:32,905 --> 00:36:35,476
I really don't know
what's going on,

329
00:36:35,509 --> 00:36:40,514
but the thing that counts
is that it is out there.

330
00:36:41,882 --> 00:36:42,682
[demon roars]

331
00:36:42,715 --> 00:36:45,051
[Tom gasps]

332
00:36:46,753 --> 00:36:48,489
What the fuck happened?

333
00:36:48,521 --> 00:36:50,924
[door slams]

334
00:37:06,273 --> 00:37:08,843
[door rattles]

335
00:37:16,583 --> 00:37:18,918
[Tom sighs]

336
00:37:28,894 --> 00:37:31,264
I gotta unlock
this fucking door.

337
00:37:32,431 --> 00:37:35,101
[Tom cries out]

338
00:37:37,036 --> 00:37:40,373
Get the fuck off of me! [pants]

339
00:37:50,550 --> 00:37:52,987
[Tom groans]

340
00:37:57,257 --> 00:37:59,760
[door creaks]

341
00:38:04,797 --> 00:38:07,300
[Tom screams]

342
00:38:08,702 --> 00:38:09,803
The fuck?

343
00:38:11,371 --> 00:38:13,407
This fucking house of horrors.

344
00:38:19,346 --> 00:38:21,715
How come that light's on?

345
00:38:21,748 --> 00:38:24,318
[floor creaks]

346
00:38:41,001 --> 00:38:42,937
I don't want to
fucking stab you.

347
00:38:48,574 --> 00:38:50,643
But I'll fucking cut you.

348
00:38:54,114 --> 00:38:56,550
[Tom grunts]

349
00:39:39,159 --> 00:39:41,260
You know what I'm
feeling right now?

350
00:39:41,293 --> 00:39:43,496
I'm feeling some
big dick energy.

351
00:39:45,130 --> 00:39:46,432
There's nothing out there.

352
00:39:49,501 --> 00:39:50,302
[static crackles]

353
00:39:50,335 --> 00:39:53,339
[demon roars]

354
00:39:53,373 --> 00:39:57,110
After all this time,
anything that's trying

355
00:39:57,143 --> 00:39:58,612
to get to me ought to know

356
00:40:01,614 --> 00:40:03,050
I can't be fooled.

357
00:40:05,552 --> 00:40:07,019
[chair bangs]

358
00:40:07,052 --> 00:40:10,556
You motherfucker, come out
from under there, come out!

359
00:40:10,590 --> 00:40:12,559
Where the fuck is this thing?

360
00:40:12,592 --> 00:40:13,393
[chair rustles]

361
00:40:13,425 --> 00:40:15,461
Son of a bitch!

362
00:40:15,494 --> 00:40:16,730
What the fuck?

363
00:40:17,664 --> 00:40:20,801
Oh, Christ, I'm stuck. [pants]

364
00:40:49,596 --> 00:40:51,231
What the fuck is this?

365
00:40:54,900 --> 00:40:56,802
Where's this shit
keep coming from?

366
00:40:56,835 --> 00:40:59,972
Like am I a depository
for ghost bullshit,

367
00:41:00,005 --> 00:41:03,042
or just bullshit in... I need
to open some of these boxes.

368
00:41:03,076 --> 00:41:05,612
There might be something
good in one of them,

369
00:41:05,644 --> 00:41:07,447
a nice little bonus.

370
00:41:12,518 --> 00:41:15,354
[static crackles]

371
00:41:17,222 --> 00:41:19,559
I can't see a fucking thing.

372
00:41:20,425 --> 00:41:23,529
[light switch snaps]

373
00:41:24,563 --> 00:41:27,067
[demon roars]

374
00:41:47,387 --> 00:41:49,655
Well, at least the
power is back on.

375
00:41:50,856 --> 00:41:52,860
Why are the lights out
in the kitchen now?

376
00:41:56,762 --> 00:41:57,965
What is that smell?

377
00:41:59,398 --> 00:42:02,635
If Satan had an asshole,
this is what it smells like.

378
00:42:09,242 --> 00:42:14,248
So that jester was outside,
I chased out Malichi,

379
00:42:15,748 --> 00:42:19,153
but something was
in that bathroom.

380
00:42:20,385 --> 00:42:22,655
But maybe like that book said,

381
00:42:22,688 --> 00:42:27,693
where if they're not
frightening you, they take off.

382
00:42:29,027 --> 00:42:30,463
Maybe it's gone.

383
00:42:33,932 --> 00:42:35,902
It's fucking cold
in here, though.

384
00:42:38,938 --> 00:42:41,375
The thing is about that jester,

385
00:42:42,641 --> 00:42:43,442
is

386
00:42:44,643 --> 00:42:48,447
I don't remember seeing that

387
00:42:49,315 --> 00:42:50,617
in my book.

388
00:42:54,420 --> 00:42:56,255
Man, this place is fucked up.

389
00:42:58,291 --> 00:42:59,726
Let's see what I got here.

390
00:43:03,329 --> 00:43:07,167
Thank God there's lots of
pictures, but you know what?

391
00:43:07,199 --> 00:43:09,001
What am I looking for?

392
00:43:09,034 --> 00:43:11,670
I've been through this
book front to back,

393
00:43:11,704 --> 00:43:15,442
and I know that
jester isn't in here.

394
00:43:19,846 --> 00:43:24,150
Let me see, I think
I had another book

395
00:43:24,182 --> 00:43:26,085
that I picked up at a yard sale.

396
00:43:27,353 --> 00:43:29,556
Where the fuck is that thing?

397
00:43:32,492 --> 00:43:33,393
Oh, oh, oh.

398
00:43:37,163 --> 00:43:42,168
"How to Rid Your House of
Evil," by Ted Holmberg.

399
00:43:44,938 --> 00:43:47,608
Let's see what Ted has to say.

400
00:43:50,809 --> 00:43:53,212
We'll start from
the beginning here.

401
00:43:53,246 --> 00:43:58,151
"Any house can be
invaded by evil.

402
00:43:58,184 --> 00:44:02,923
The number one way to keep
your house a happy home

403
00:44:02,956 --> 00:44:06,626
and free of demonic
possessions is

404
00:44:06,659 --> 00:44:10,063
to make your house
a happy house.

405
00:44:11,396 --> 00:44:16,135
You have to put out
flowers, play cheery music,

406
00:44:16,168 --> 00:44:21,173
be positive, and no demon
will want to be around."

407
00:44:22,407 --> 00:44:23,777
Are you a fucking idiot?

408
00:44:25,644 --> 00:44:29,181
Ted, you don't
know shit. [sighs]

409
00:44:31,985 --> 00:44:33,519
Fucking how can
this be happening?

410
00:44:33,552 --> 00:44:35,688
Every time I think
these things are gone,

411
00:44:35,722 --> 00:44:40,027
things are quiet for a while,
and then they come back.

412
00:44:52,704 --> 00:44:53,940
Do I have

413
00:44:56,608 --> 00:44:58,045
something in this home?

414
00:45:02,047 --> 00:45:04,583
What the fuck is that smell?

415
00:45:06,418 --> 00:45:07,853
Let me make sure.

416
00:45:15,594 --> 00:45:20,599
So I could sure know if fucking
demon turds are in there.

417
00:45:22,735 --> 00:45:25,072
[Tom sighs]

418
00:45:26,371 --> 00:45:28,340
Everything keeps getting moved.

419
00:45:28,373 --> 00:45:33,379
This is just... well, this is
pretty much the way it's been.

420
00:45:34,746 --> 00:45:37,884
If I have nothing in here,
nothing should be getting moved.

421
00:45:41,820 --> 00:45:44,623
[Tom sighs]

422
00:45:44,657 --> 00:45:46,360
I need to take it easy here.

423
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:51,230
Oh, fuck. [sighs]

424
00:45:57,603 --> 00:45:58,572
Hello?

425
00:46:03,242 --> 00:46:04,478
I dare you

426
00:46:05,677 --> 00:46:06,679
to come out.

427
00:46:07,847 --> 00:46:09,316
Show yourself!

428
00:46:10,882 --> 00:46:12,585
Well, there ain't shit in here.

429
00:46:17,456 --> 00:46:19,893
[Tom grunts]

430
00:46:40,313 --> 00:46:43,083
What the fuck is
that smell, God.

431
00:46:49,121 --> 00:46:51,957
It's fucking getting
cold in here.

432
00:47:14,646 --> 00:47:17,083
[Tom snores]

433
00:47:55,288 --> 00:47:57,958
[door clatters]

434
00:47:58,858 --> 00:48:01,861
[Tom cries out]

435
00:48:01,893 --> 00:48:03,062
Motherfucking.

436
00:48:05,130 --> 00:48:07,634
[Tom mutters]

437
00:48:14,907 --> 00:48:17,344
[door slams]

438
00:48:20,913 --> 00:48:24,016
So much for these warm
fucking cheery thoughts.

439
00:48:24,050 --> 00:48:26,720
I was having a nice fucking
dream about ice cream.

440
00:48:54,813 --> 00:48:56,215
Where are you?

441
00:48:56,248 --> 00:48:57,884
I can smell you.

442
00:49:02,054 --> 00:49:03,523
What a fucking shit hole.

443
00:49:11,329 --> 00:49:14,000
[Tom cries out]

444
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:17,703
Fuck, this is a nasty
motherfucker right here,

445
00:49:17,737 --> 00:49:22,608
to throw a fake fucking
pumpkin at me. [sighs]

446
00:49:22,641 --> 00:49:25,978
I need to find some... he
ain't scared of knives.

447
00:49:26,012 --> 00:49:28,847
How the fuck can
something even be in here?

448
00:49:30,282 --> 00:49:33,420
I need a cross, where's
that fucking cross?

449
00:49:34,820 --> 00:49:36,856
Oh, fucking cross, I'm lucky
God don't strike me dead

450
00:49:36,889 --> 00:49:37,856
where I'm standing.

451
00:49:42,494 --> 00:49:44,931
Fucking hit me with
a fucking pumpkin?

452
00:49:46,331 --> 00:49:48,835
I'm gonna hit you with my
foot right in your ghost ass.

453
00:49:55,407 --> 00:49:58,844
What the fuck is that,
is that a brownie?

454
00:50:04,617 --> 00:50:06,653
[Tom sniffs]

455
00:50:06,686 --> 00:50:07,921
Hmm, goddamn.

456
00:50:11,123 --> 00:50:15,262
I don't know where the fuck
that came from, but mm.

[Tom cries out]

459
00:50:36,782 --> 00:50:38,218
Nothing here.

460
00:50:43,688 --> 00:50:47,460
I've got this terrible
feeling of dread,

461
00:50:47,492 --> 00:50:52,164
like everything bad's
gonna happen at once.

462
00:50:52,197 --> 00:50:54,667

You motherfucker. [sighs]

466
00:51:28,134 --> 00:51:30,001
What the fuck was that?

467
00:51:30,034 --> 00:51:32,538
[Tom screams]

468
00:51:33,972 --> 00:51:35,307

[door creaks]

471
00:51:42,648 --> 00:51:45,251
Fucking stabbed
me, what the fuck?

472
00:51:49,789 --> 00:51:54,260
I know... where the
fuck is the stab mark?

473
00:51:54,293 --> 00:51:56,563
I fucking know I got stabbed.

474
00:51:59,565 --> 00:52:02,402
What the fuck, I'm
losing my fucking mind.

475
00:52:04,135 --> 00:52:07,139
I am so far in over my head.

476
00:52:10,476 --> 00:52:12,811
For this one, I could
sure use a hand.

477
00:52:19,351 --> 00:52:20,486
What the fuck is that?

478
00:52:20,518 --> 00:52:23,021
[demon roars]

479
00:52:35,201 --> 00:52:40,206
"You said you needed a hand."

480
00:52:42,807 --> 00:52:47,213
It's a fucking hand,
it's a fucking hand.

481
00:52:47,246 --> 00:52:50,550
Oh, what the fuck?

482
00:52:50,583 --> 00:52:54,253
What the fuck, what the
fuck was in that brownie?

483
00:52:58,923 --> 00:53:01,326
[demon roars]

484
00:53:04,396 --> 00:53:06,966
[hand patters]

485
00:53:16,141 --> 00:53:18,510
What the fuck is that?

486
00:53:18,543 --> 00:53:20,045
Oh, what the fuck?

487
00:53:59,818 --> 00:54:02,889

running all this time?

[floor creaks]

496
00:55:56,969 --> 00:56:00,039
What the fuck happened
to my brownie?

497
00:56:03,108 --> 00:56:05,411
Mm, it's a pretzel.

498
00:56:15,186 --> 00:56:17,489
I need to do a little
demon research.

Hello?

[floor creaks]

506
00:57:58,590 --> 00:58:00,760
Let's do a little googling.

507
00:58:12,737 --> 00:58:14,539
What the fuck is going on?

508
00:58:14,572 --> 00:58:17,844
I'm not typing, what
the fuck is going on?

509
00:58:20,813 --> 00:58:21,914
What the fuck is this?

510
00:58:27,052 --> 00:58:28,187
You seeing this?

511
00:58:28,219 --> 00:58:31,089
Of course you're seeing
it, I'm seeing it.

00:58:32,123 --> 00:58:34,993
"Not your home, not your home."

513
00:58:36,460 --> 00:58:38,530
What the fuck, no
ashes to write in?

[Tom burps]

515
00:58:46,038 --> 00:58:47,206
Oh, excuse me.

"He is coming,"
who the fuck is he?

517
00:59:04,655 --> 00:59:08,059
Well, we've been over
this, this is my home.

518
00:59:11,429 --> 00:59:12,931
What the fuck is that?

519

[printer whirs]

520
00:59:27,311 --> 00:59:31,016

home, not your home,

coming, he is coming."

522
00:59:37,155 --> 00:59:37,990
What the fuck?

523
00:59:46,398 --> 00:59:48,867
I just pulled the
plug on this thing.

Let's see if old [sighs]
Ted here can shine

528
01:00:18,963 --> 01:00:19,532
any light on this.

529
01:00:27,005 --> 01:00:29,709
Let me get this on
the other camera, too.

530
01:00:52,097 --> 01:00:55,768
Here [indistinct].

531
01:00:55,800 --> 01:00:56,601
Okay, Ted.

532
01:01:01,005 --> 01:01:05,344
That dude looks like what
I'm looking for, page 212.

533
01:01:12,317 --> 01:01:16,789
He says you should try
communicating with the spirits.

534
01:01:30,469 --> 01:01:32,171
Where the fuck is that thing?

535
01:01:41,579 --> 01:01:42,414
There.

536
01:01:43,914 --> 01:01:44,717
Okay.

537
01:01:47,885 --> 01:01:49,989
This is the best way I know of.

538
01:01:54,492 --> 01:01:55,494
Communicating.

539
01:02:10,342 --> 01:02:15,247

ghosts or spirits in the house?

Yes, that's what I
was afraid of. [sighs]

542
01:02:33,565 --> 01:02:37,235
So he's saying I should
communicate with these fuckers.

543
01:02:43,275 --> 01:02:47,046
"Beware when communicating
with the paranormal.

544
01:02:47,079 --> 01:02:50,416
Be very careful," no shit.

545
01:02:50,449 --> 01:02:54,153
"There is an account given
of an evil occultist,

546
01:02:54,186 --> 01:02:58,057
Travis McHenry, who
long ago opened a portal

547
01:02:58,090 --> 01:03:02,394
to the spirit world and would
regularly summon evil spirits

548
01:03:02,427 --> 01:03:05,431
to attack those he despised.

549
01:03:05,463 --> 01:03:09,300
Unfortunately, Travis
summoned the demon known

550
01:03:09,333 --> 01:03:13,337
as the bringer of disease,
famine, and drought.

551
01:03:13,371 --> 01:03:15,407
He could not control this demon

552
01:03:15,440 --> 01:03:17,576
and was drug into the portal,

553
01:03:17,608 --> 01:03:20,411
never to be seen or
heard from again.

554
01:03:20,445 --> 01:03:22,815
The demon he summoned, Pazuzu."

555
01:03:24,148 --> 01:03:26,317
Don't say that name!

556
01:03:26,351 --> 01:03:28,320
Who the fuck are you?

557
01:03:28,353 --> 01:03:31,389
[rain patters]

558
01:03:31,422 --> 01:03:34,592
I was a priest when I
walked among the living.

559
01:03:35,960 --> 01:03:37,395
Where's your body?

560
01:03:37,429 --> 01:03:39,164
That name you said-

561
01:03:39,197 --> 01:03:39,998
- Pazuzu?

562
01:03:40,030 --> 01:03:42,233
Don't say that name!

563
01:03:43,501 --> 01:03:47,271
I attempted to exorcize
him from a small child.

564
01:03:47,304 --> 01:03:51,676
He said I angered him
because I looked like Jesus.

565
01:03:51,710 --> 01:03:54,246
Like Jesus on heroin, maybe.

566
01:03:54,278 --> 01:03:56,849
He tore my body apart

567
01:03:56,882 --> 01:04:00,251
and spread the pieces
across the land.

568
01:04:00,284 --> 01:04:02,887
He is unstoppable.

569
01:04:02,920 --> 01:04:04,422
Well, the good news is,

570
01:04:04,456 --> 01:04:07,226
I think I can help
you find your hand.

571
01:04:07,259 --> 01:04:10,096
[thunder rumbles]

572
01:04:11,963 --> 01:04:13,365
So what's he look like?

573
01:04:13,398 --> 01:04:15,300
He will not show himself
[door creaks]

574
01:04:15,333 --> 01:04:20,239
to any living soul, but
you will know he is here,

575
01:04:20,271 --> 01:04:23,307
and he will bring
other demons with him,

576
01:04:23,340 --> 01:04:25,944
some of which are already here,

577
01:04:27,411 --> 01:04:30,682
and they will soon launch a
vicious attack against you.

578
01:04:31,916 --> 01:04:36,922
[thunder rumbles]
[rain patters]

579
01:04:38,356 --> 01:04:39,825
So I got this evil jester
running around the house,

580
01:04:39,858 --> 01:04:42,661
I got this hunchback
out in the driveway.

581
01:04:42,693 --> 01:04:45,630
I've got I think what's
your hand running around.

582
01:04:45,664 --> 01:04:48,567
There's doors opening and
closing, stuff that's happening.

583
01:04:48,599 --> 01:04:50,434
The laptop's saying
"He is coming,

584
01:04:50,467 --> 01:04:53,237
he is coming, he is coming,"
the printer's printing out,

585
01:04:53,271 --> 01:04:55,240
"He's coming, he's
coming, he's coming."

586
01:04:55,273 --> 01:04:57,442
When is he coming, this Pazuzu?

587
01:04:57,474 --> 01:05:00,945
I said don't say that name.

588
01:05:00,978 --> 01:05:04,349
Whoa, whoa, whoa, druggo
Jesus, take it easy.

589
01:05:05,817 --> 01:05:09,253
No, he is here!

590
01:05:09,286 --> 01:05:10,888
Where is he?

591
01:05:10,922 --> 01:05:13,358
[Tom grunts]

592
01:05:18,128 --> 01:05:20,431
[doors slamming]

593
01:05:20,465 --> 01:05:24,870
Jesus Christ, my fucking
life ain't getting no better.

You fucking cocksucker,
who the fuck are you?

597
01:05:38,650 --> 01:05:41,019
What the fuck are you?

What?

603
01:06:28,599 --> 01:06:30,601
No, no, no, no.

Oh, you cocksucker.

608

Come, show yourself.

609
01:06:57,195 --> 01:06:58,664
Show yourself!

What the fuck is that smell?

618
01:08:11,869 --> 01:08:13,438
What the fuck?

619
01:08:13,471 --> 01:08:14,505
[demon roars]

620
01:08:14,539 --> 01:08:15,374
Oh my God.

Fucking

623
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:25,283
flush the toilet
for Christ's sakes.

Oh, that fucking
hurt, you bastard.

634

I need to get the fuck
out of this house.

635
01:09:13,131 --> 01:09:15,734
Wait, I can't get
out the front door,

636
01:09:15,766 --> 01:09:18,903
but I can get out that
window, that's how I got in,

637
01:09:18,936 --> 01:09:22,440
and I'm gonna take this camera
with me... and a flashlight

638
01:09:22,474 --> 01:09:24,376
and the cross, who
left these here?

639
01:09:24,408 --> 01:09:25,344
This is perfect.

640
01:09:29,146 --> 01:09:30,215
Oh, fuck.

641
01:09:36,587 --> 01:09:37,588
Oh, fuck.

I need this, I need this.

652
01:10:59,570 --> 01:11:01,073

[demon cries out]

656
01:11:30,835 --> 01:11:33,270
Listen, this may be the
last will and testament

657
01:11:33,304 --> 01:11:37,943
of Tom Riley, but I don't
know whether I'm better off

658
01:11:37,975 --> 01:11:42,980
in there or out here
in these haunted woods.

659
01:11:44,047 --> 01:11:47,085
But I've come to
realize that this is not

660
01:11:47,118 --> 01:11:51,289
about that house being haunted.

661
01:11:51,322 --> 01:11:56,226
This is about this
land being haunted.

662
01:11:56,260 --> 01:11:57,662
[gun fires]

663
01:11:57,694 --> 01:11:58,796
What the fuck was that?

[Tom pants]

665
01:12:07,572 --> 01:12:11,476
I think I'm gonna go
deeper into the woods here

666
01:12:11,509 --> 01:12:14,578
and try and put some distance
between me and the house.

667
01:12:14,612 --> 01:12:18,817
But the fact of it is, is
this is haunted property.

668
01:12:18,850 --> 01:12:20,919
There's things going on here,

669
01:12:20,952 --> 01:12:24,289
so long before this
house was even here,

670
01:12:24,322 --> 01:12:27,159
there was something here
that has brought this on.

671
01:12:30,595 --> 01:12:32,497
What the fuck was that?

672
01:12:36,134 --> 01:12:38,170
What the fuck are
you doing out here?

673
01:12:40,238 --> 01:12:41,472
What are you pointing at?

674
01:12:51,381 --> 01:12:54,385
[glass shatters]

675
01:12:54,418 --> 01:12:55,653
What is that up there?

676
01:12:57,020 --> 01:12:58,389
How do you zoom this thing?

677
01:13:00,957 --> 01:13:05,396
Ugh, druggo Jesus, I
can't leave him in there.

[glass shatters]

679
01:13:10,935 --> 01:13:12,771
What the fuck is that?

680
01:13:21,345 --> 01:13:22,180
Ugh.

681
01:13:23,648 --> 01:13:26,485
Bitch, I know, I'm going
back there in a minute.

682
01:13:29,921 --> 01:13:30,822
Where the fuck?

683
01:13:34,692 --> 01:13:37,561
I gotta go in there and
save him from this bullshit.

684
01:14:26,610 --> 01:14:29,514
Here I go again
with this bullshit.

685

[camera rattles]

686
01:14:37,688 --> 01:14:41,092
I guess the thought
never... oh, God,

687
01:14:41,125 --> 01:14:45,063
crossed my fucking mind about
eating a fucking carrot.

688

Size 44, my ass. [grunts]

689

Hey, Ben, Ben?

Listen, here's a list of
shit I need you to get,

697
01:16:01,538 --> 01:16:05,143

Druggo Jesus, all
right, Father Murphy,

700
01:16:18,722 --> 01:16:21,059
I know that's your real name.

701
01:16:21,091 --> 01:16:25,062
I met you here in
this house a couple

702
01:16:25,095 --> 01:16:27,031
of years ago at Christmas.

703
01:16:30,635 --> 01:16:31,802
Father Murphy?

704
01:16:49,185 --> 01:16:50,020
Hello?

705
01:16:51,855 --> 01:16:52,823
Father Murphy?

706
01:16:57,494 --> 01:16:58,329
Oh shit.

707
01:17:05,802 --> 01:17:07,538
Do I want to go up here?

[attic door creaks]

709
01:17:13,344 --> 01:17:15,246
In the name of Jesus
Christ, get out!

01:17:15,279 --> 01:17:17,749
[demon roars]

711
01:17:17,782 --> 01:17:19,284
Well, that worked.

[static crackles]

713
01:17:31,729 --> 01:17:34,633
In the name of Jesus
Christ, get out!

714
01:17:38,336 --> 01:17:39,704
Oh, that was convenient.

[floor creaks]

720
01:18:24,481 --> 01:18:25,317
Father Murphy?

721
01:18:27,984 --> 01:18:30,087
Father Murphy, what the fuck?

722
01:18:40,564 --> 01:18:42,266
I don't want to play anymore.

723
01:18:42,298 --> 01:18:44,168
I want to get the
fuck out of here.

724
