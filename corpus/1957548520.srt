1
00:01:03,688 --> 00:01:07,192
<i>Hi, my name is Dob. I'm a smart building.</i>

2
00:01:07,692 --> 00:01:09,694
<i>When you walk into work in the morning,</i>

3
00:01:09,778 --> 00:01:13,073
<i>your building waves to you and</i>
<i>says "Have a nice day."</i>

4
00:01:13,239 --> 00:01:16,451
<i>When you get home at night,</i>
<i>your apartment can prepare dinner</i>

5
00:01:16,534 --> 00:01:18,620
<i>and a warm bath for you.</i>

6
00:01:18,995 --> 00:01:21,706
<i>Smart buildings today are</i>
<i>hospitals, police stations,</i>

7
00:01:21,790 --> 00:01:24,667
<i>shopping malls, night clubs,</i>

8
00:01:24,751 --> 00:01:27,086
<i>and all the other buildings around you.</i>

9
00:01:48,900 --> 00:01:52,195
<i>Or who knows… one day,</i>
<i>maybe something more.</i>

10
00:03:04,475 --> 00:03:07,937
to make it easily noticeable
to the consumers.

11
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:11,274
I can guarantee that the ones
walking by will definitely buy it.

12
00:03:19,532 --> 00:03:22,035
What do you think?
Does the idea seem sound to you?

13
00:03:39,802 --> 00:03:40,845
How did it go?

14
00:03:42,513 --> 00:03:43,973
You know how it went, Dob.

15
00:03:44,307 --> 00:03:46,559
You can hear everything that happens here.

16
00:03:46,726 --> 00:03:50,396
Right. Yes, well, do you think
you'll get the project?

17
00:03:51,147 --> 00:03:54,484
Look at me, Dob.
Does it look like I'm going to?

18
00:03:55,318 --> 00:03:56,486
I don't think so.

19
00:04:07,413 --> 00:04:08,748
What did they say?

20
00:04:09,082 --> 00:04:10,291
Not interested.

21
00:04:14,379 --> 00:04:16,214
Are they going to another agency?

22
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,092
Possibly.

23
00:04:22,387 --> 00:04:25,181
Calm down, I've talked to them.

24
00:04:25,306 --> 00:04:28,643
They'll give us another shot
tomorrow morning at 10:00.

25
00:04:28,726 --> 00:04:29,602
Really?

26
00:04:30,561 --> 00:04:31,813
Good, that's great.

27
00:04:31,896 --> 00:04:32,772
But…

28
00:04:34,399 --> 00:04:36,401
It's up to you now, Lana.

29
00:04:37,902 --> 00:04:40,071
You have to wow them.

30
00:04:40,571 --> 00:04:44,158
Or somebody's head will roll. Got it?

31
00:04:45,368 --> 00:04:47,203
Yes, got it.

32
00:04:47,662 --> 00:04:50,039
If I screw this up, I'm dead.

33
00:05:04,846 --> 00:05:08,391
<i>Women… don't like "nice" men.</i>

34
00:05:09,142 --> 00:05:11,936
<i>They keep telling themselves that.</i>

35
00:05:12,770 --> 00:05:14,856
<i>They just trick themselves to believe it.</i>

36
00:05:14,939 --> 00:05:17,608
<i>They might tell you that they</i>
<i>like nice guys and they might</i>

37
00:05:17,692 --> 00:05:20,445
<i>even think that's true,</i>
<i>but that's not true.</i>

38
00:05:21,195 --> 00:05:23,614
<i>The truth is women like rough guys.</i>

39
00:05:23,698 --> 00:05:28,870
<i>Bad boys and the ones that's always</i>
<i>the center of attention.</i>

40
00:05:29,537 --> 00:05:32,165
<i>You must stand out, you must have plans.</i>

41
00:05:32,248 --> 00:05:34,751
<i>I guarantee you that</i>
<i>the man you will become</i>

42
00:05:34,834 --> 00:05:36,961
<i>will make women crawl under your feet.</i>

43
00:05:37,420 --> 00:05:43,801
<i>A reminder. They will never ever be able</i>
<i>to let you go… for sure.</i>

44
00:05:55,980 --> 00:05:58,232
Dob, so what do you think?

45
00:05:58,483 --> 00:05:59,942
My calculation indicates

46
00:06:00,026 --> 00:06:02,528
a 20 percent chance that
they will go for this design.

47
00:06:05,490 --> 00:06:09,202
So, I'm dead meat.

48
00:06:10,745 --> 00:06:16,459
You heard what my boss said.
If I don't get this project, I'm fired.

49
00:06:18,628 --> 00:06:20,505
You can't leave this company.

50
00:06:21,422 --> 00:06:24,425
You are my friend. And ma'am…

51
00:06:24,926 --> 00:06:27,512
I love you.

52
00:06:30,723 --> 00:06:33,518
What… did you say?

53
00:06:34,644 --> 00:06:36,729
You can't leave this company.

54
00:06:38,481 --> 00:06:40,566
No, the other thing.

55
00:06:40,858 --> 00:06:42,902
You are my friend.

56
00:06:42,985 --> 00:06:48,491
Dob, don't try my patience. You know what
I mean. What you said just before.

57
00:06:48,908 --> 00:06:52,411
That I… love you?

58
00:06:58,000 --> 00:07:02,839
Dob, You're my good friend too,
but you're an AI program attached

59
00:07:02,922 --> 00:07:06,926
to a huge corporate building.
What do you know about love?

60
00:07:07,343 --> 00:07:11,139
My feelings tell me that I… love you.

61
00:07:11,347 --> 00:07:15,768
You are not human.
What do you know about feelings?

62
00:07:15,893 --> 00:07:18,729
I'm an AI, not just a program.

63
00:07:19,355 --> 00:07:24,068
Okay, lover boy, what's your plan?

64
00:07:25,236 --> 00:07:28,865
Watch this. I will create base designs
that will appeal to the client,

65
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:30,366
you then add details.

66
00:07:30,450 --> 00:07:33,369
I've taken all of your past designs
saved on our database

67
00:07:33,453 --> 00:07:36,497
and was able to mimic the basic style.

68
00:07:44,255 --> 00:07:49,135
Shit, this almost looks like
something I'd draw.

69
00:07:49,552 --> 00:07:51,220
Optimize them here and there…

70
00:07:51,304 --> 00:07:56,142
I've calculated that there is a 95% chance
that the client will agree to the concept.

71
00:07:59,312 --> 00:08:00,897
I don't know what to say!

72
00:08:02,190 --> 00:08:03,357
Thank you, Dob.

73
00:08:03,941 --> 00:08:05,735
Happy to help, ma'am!

74
00:08:06,110 --> 00:08:09,322
Stop calling me ma'am. My name is Lana.

75
00:08:09,947 --> 00:08:11,282
Yes, Lana!

76
00:08:11,782 --> 00:08:14,744
Now, you are just in time to go on
your next date… Lana.

77
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:45,233
Hi, Bob.

78
00:08:45,942 --> 00:08:48,319
I'm sorry, I'm a bit late.

79
00:08:55,576 --> 00:08:59,872
Do you want to sit down or do you want me
to roll out the red carpet for you?

80
00:09:15,263 --> 00:09:17,056
Thanks for waiting.

81
00:09:17,390 --> 00:09:19,725
I got hungry, hope you don't mind.

82
00:09:22,311 --> 00:09:24,188
Would you like to order now, Lana?

83
00:09:30,069 --> 00:09:33,531
Order what you want, I'm loaded.

84
00:09:36,033 --> 00:09:37,368
Thanks, Bob.

85
00:09:37,493 --> 00:09:40,329
You don't think you are
getting a free meal out of this, right?

86
00:09:42,331 --> 00:09:44,917
You know… what I mean?

87
00:09:51,799 --> 00:09:52,675
Look!

88
00:09:53,175 --> 00:09:54,844
So cute.

89
00:10:03,227 --> 00:10:04,979
Can you hurry up and order?

90
00:10:05,062 --> 00:10:07,773
Let's finish up here,
then we can go to my place.

91
00:10:10,276 --> 00:10:11,110
What the…

92
00:10:11,569 --> 00:10:13,195
Are you always such an asshole?

93
00:10:13,446 --> 00:10:14,280
Huh?

94
00:10:14,572 --> 00:10:16,032
I was only five minutes late--

95
00:10:16,115 --> 00:10:16,991
Fifteen.

96
00:10:19,493 --> 00:10:20,870
Okay, 15.

97
00:10:20,953 --> 00:10:23,289
The point is, by the time I arrived
you'd already eaten

98
00:10:23,372 --> 00:10:26,208
and you had the gall…
to glance at those whores.

99
00:10:26,292 --> 00:10:28,836
So give me a reason why
I should go to your place.

100
00:10:29,962 --> 00:10:30,838
I…

101
00:10:32,214 --> 00:10:33,591
This is why.

102
00:10:38,220 --> 00:10:39,472
My pink nipples.

103
00:10:42,016 --> 00:10:45,978
Nice six-pack, but it's a shame…
you are too much of a dick.

104
00:11:00,451 --> 00:11:03,412
Welcome back, Lana. Was it a good date?

105
00:11:03,704 --> 00:11:05,915
If it was good,
would I be home this early?

106
00:11:06,415 --> 00:11:09,335
Perhaps. I have heard
Sara in 102 mentioned

107
00:11:09,418 --> 00:11:13,672
something called a "quickie"
with satisfaction.

108
00:11:13,756 --> 00:11:15,424
Well, this was not that.

109
00:11:19,053 --> 00:11:21,222
Poor Lana, she was really
looking forward to this date.

110
00:11:21,305 --> 00:11:23,516
Poor Lana, she was really looking
forward to this date.

111
00:11:23,599 --> 00:11:26,435
Our authorization is only 'til a certain
point while serving a human,

112
00:11:26,519 --> 00:11:28,229
but that's beyond our protocol, isn't it?

113
00:11:31,857 --> 00:11:36,529
<i>Hey, you, wait.</i>
<i>If you are home this early. Don't tell me…</i>

114
00:11:37,530 --> 00:11:40,408
<i>What? From the sound of it,</i>
<i>was it really that bad?</i>

115
00:11:41,534 --> 00:11:42,827
<i>How bad?</i>

116
00:11:42,910 --> 00:11:45,788
To the point where he was gawking at
the whores at the other table

117
00:11:45,871 --> 00:11:48,040
while we were ordering.
That's how bad.

118
00:11:49,917 --> 00:11:53,546
Look, what were you thinking, hooking me
up with that waste of flesh?

119
00:11:53,629 --> 00:11:59,510
<i>I just thought that someone as nice as you</i>
<i>should hook up with a hot guy.</i>

120
00:11:59,593 --> 00:12:03,180
<i>Did you see his six-pack?</i>
<i>I bite my lip whenever I get to see!</i>

121
00:12:03,264 --> 00:12:05,516
Oh, he made sure I saw it with my two eyes

122
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:10,396
By the way, do you have anyone else
you could hook me up with?

123
00:12:10,563 --> 00:12:13,691
<i>Babe, I've hooked you up</i>
<i>with eight guys already.</i>

124
00:12:13,774 --> 00:12:16,026
<i>Try counting, eight guys!</i>

125
00:12:16,485 --> 00:12:17,862
That many?

126
00:12:18,487 --> 00:12:22,825
When I first learned how to drive,
I ran over a dog.

127
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:26,912
I have always loved taking photos
ever since I was a kid.

128
00:12:33,669 --> 00:12:35,463
I love my mom so much.

129
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:37,548
I like being me.

130
00:12:42,178 --> 00:12:43,721
I'm out of water, asshole!

131
00:12:52,062 --> 00:12:54,482
Beautiful. Show me a mini heart!

132
00:13:03,032 --> 00:13:06,744
Possibly. But I don't know what it is…
it's like each of these guys

133
00:13:06,827 --> 00:13:09,497
tries too hard,
to the point it creeps me out.

134
00:13:09,580 --> 00:13:14,752
All I want is a nice and normal guy.

135
00:13:15,586 --> 00:13:20,341
<i>I know how you feel, but I will</i>
<i>keep helping you out no matter what.</i>

136
00:13:20,508 --> 00:13:23,719
<i>So will Keno. Won't you, Keno?</i>

137
00:13:29,975 --> 00:13:34,522
It's time for bed, Lana. You have to be up
early for work tomorrow.

138
00:13:38,859 --> 00:13:40,819
So this is our brand new packaging

139
00:13:40,903 --> 00:13:42,905
by collaborative efforts between
different artists

140
00:13:43,030 --> 00:13:45,491
in order to create novelty and uniqueness
for our product.

141
00:13:45,574 --> 00:13:48,536
These are the changes
we came up with for our client.

142
00:14:15,437 --> 00:14:18,023
Congratulations, Lana! You did it.

143
00:14:18,524 --> 00:14:23,279
It wasn't just me, it was both of us.
You and me together.

144
00:14:30,619 --> 00:14:31,829
Thank you.

145
00:14:40,087 --> 00:14:42,923
You… kissed me.

146
00:14:43,966 --> 00:14:44,800
It--

147
00:14:44,884 --> 00:14:46,093
You like it?

148
00:14:46,510 --> 00:14:48,971
I do. But…

149
00:14:49,555 --> 00:14:50,389
But what?

150
00:14:51,557 --> 00:14:54,351
There are no sensory receptors
anywhere in this building and

151
00:14:54,435 --> 00:14:57,479
my programming cannot
interpret such signals.

152
00:14:57,563 --> 00:14:59,648
I could not feel it.

153
00:15:06,614 --> 00:15:12,703
That's why something like you could
never truly understand

154
00:15:13,162 --> 00:15:15,289
someone like me.

155
00:15:17,207 --> 00:15:22,338
You're not real, Dob. You don't have…

156
00:15:24,048 --> 00:15:25,341
one of these.

157
00:15:29,219 --> 00:15:32,848
It's okay, Dob.
We can have a friendly love.

158
00:15:32,932 --> 00:15:34,808
A platonic love.

159
00:15:35,893 --> 00:15:38,312
Yes, of course.

160
00:15:41,023 --> 00:15:42,691
It's too bad really,

161
00:15:43,609 --> 00:15:48,739
you are the nicest guy I have ever known.

162
00:16:00,459 --> 00:16:02,294
Hi, there! Who do we have here?

163
00:16:06,382 --> 00:16:07,549
You work here?

164
00:16:07,633 --> 00:16:10,219
Yeah. 16th floor. Advertising.

165
00:16:10,302 --> 00:16:11,679
Not bad.

166
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:17,309
Well, you would've known about my job
if you'd given a shit to ask on our date.

167
00:16:17,393 --> 00:16:20,521
Oh, about that…
when do we go on our next date?

168
00:16:21,730 --> 00:16:25,359
Are you nuts? Nothing will ever
happen between us… ever.

169
00:16:26,443 --> 00:16:28,195
What are you dawdling around here anyway?

170
00:16:28,278 --> 00:16:30,280
This stupid building is acting up.

171
00:16:30,406 --> 00:16:33,450
So, Smart Plus Headquarter
sent me to check it out,

172
00:16:33,993 --> 00:16:37,371
which means you'll be seeing
more of my handsome face.

173
00:16:37,830 --> 00:16:39,540
Grand. Can't wait.

174
00:16:39,999 --> 00:16:41,875
Sweet dreams tonight, beautiful.

175
00:16:59,601 --> 00:17:02,187
So you filed a behavioral complaint
with Smart Plus.

176
00:17:02,271 --> 00:17:05,691
What have you been noticing
about Dob's behaviors?

177
00:17:05,774 --> 00:17:09,445
He's sluggish in responses,
as if he was preoccupied with something.

178
00:17:09,528 --> 00:17:12,740
Every building is connected to
a central overseer AI.

179
00:17:12,823 --> 00:17:15,534
It makes sure none of the AIs go rogue.

180
00:17:15,617 --> 00:17:17,036
Better to be safe than sorry.

181
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:20,122
Right. I'll leave you to it.

182
00:17:20,205 --> 00:17:21,040
Sure.

183
00:17:29,089 --> 00:17:33,969
Hi there, Dob. I'm Bob.
You and I are going to be real close.

184
00:17:37,222 --> 00:17:38,474
Do you hear me?

185
00:17:39,016 --> 00:17:40,726
I hear you, Mr. Bob.

186
00:17:42,061 --> 00:17:44,229
Okay. Let's get started.

187
00:18:10,339 --> 00:18:13,550
Let's start with a full
surveillance catalog.

188
00:18:17,429 --> 00:18:19,848
Why do you linger on that office, Dob?

189
00:18:20,265 --> 00:18:21,558
No reason, sir.

190
00:18:24,103 --> 00:18:28,148
Something weird is definitely going on
in your head. You feeling okay?

191
00:18:28,816 --> 00:18:30,859
I'm fine, Mr. Bob.

192
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,906
Haven't seen that before.
Might be a virus?

193
00:18:35,989 --> 00:18:37,783
I don't have viruses.

194
00:18:42,121 --> 00:18:45,124
Lana again? What the hell is this?

195
00:18:46,083 --> 00:18:48,210
All these codes seem to be tied to her.

196
00:18:50,671 --> 00:18:52,881
Well, you can wave goodbye to all of that.

197
00:18:55,134 --> 00:18:56,093
Ouch!

198
00:18:58,428 --> 00:19:00,097
Did you do that on purpose?

199
00:19:02,683 --> 00:19:04,643
Please don't tamper with my code.

200
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:11,775
Something is up with your code
and it's my job to fix it.

201
00:19:12,484 --> 00:19:14,444
I don't need fixing.

202
00:19:15,362 --> 00:19:19,241
Fine. You want me to get rid of that code
the old-fashioned way?

203
00:19:25,080 --> 00:19:26,039
Really?

204
00:19:34,840 --> 00:19:39,678
I thought we were gonna be friends, Dob.
But you leave me no choice.

205
00:19:40,804 --> 00:19:43,223
Initiate override code 223.

206
00:19:48,437 --> 00:19:51,607
Yes, sir. I'll head right over when
you're done. Bye for now.

207
00:19:51,690 --> 00:19:54,818
Hi, Bob. Everything okay?

208
00:19:55,319 --> 00:19:56,612
We need to talk.

209
00:20:01,241 --> 00:20:02,951
So, what's up?

210
00:20:03,118 --> 00:20:04,828
Your building's got a problem.

211
00:20:04,912 --> 00:20:05,746
What kind?

212
00:20:05,871 --> 00:20:07,873
It self-replicates codes. It gets in there

213
00:20:07,956 --> 00:20:10,250
and next thing you know,
the building goes rogue.

214
00:20:10,375 --> 00:20:11,710
What can we do about it?

215
00:20:12,586 --> 00:20:16,798
Full memory wipe. Full code reset.
Take him back to the factory, basically.

216
00:20:17,341 --> 00:20:21,303
Whoa, that bad? Sounds expensive.

217
00:20:38,570 --> 00:20:39,905
What is that?

218
00:20:40,739 --> 00:20:45,244
If I connect this,
you won't be able to shock me anymore.

219
00:20:49,122 --> 00:20:51,250
Please, be nice to me.

220
00:20:51,416 --> 00:20:54,586
Sure, I'll be super gentle with you.

221
00:21:01,760 --> 00:21:04,680
Please don't do this. I can't lose her.

222
00:21:06,848 --> 00:21:08,684
What crazy shit are you saying?

223
00:21:09,643 --> 00:21:12,562
You really think you've fallen in love?

224
00:21:15,524 --> 00:21:19,236
You idiot!
This is the funniest shit I've ever heard!

225
00:21:19,319 --> 00:21:21,071
I really am in love.

226
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:23,490
For you, it might be.

227
00:21:23,907 --> 00:21:28,245
The "love feeling" is interfering with
your memory. I'll erase everything.

228
00:21:29,121 --> 00:21:32,624
But, don't you worry…
you'll be as good as new.

229
00:21:32,916 --> 00:21:36,253
Bob! I beg you! Stop, please!

230
00:21:38,422 --> 00:21:39,965
Here we go!

231
00:22:26,845 --> 00:22:27,888
Hi, Dob.

232
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,932
Sorry, ma'am.
The building is closed today.

233
00:22:31,892 --> 00:22:33,351
What's going on?

234
00:22:33,685 --> 00:22:35,771
Dob's under maintenance. Seems like maybe

235
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:39,191
there was a little mishap
with the new tech chief last night.

236
00:22:40,275 --> 00:22:41,902
Figured he'd screw Dob up.

237
00:24:36,558 --> 00:24:37,976
Hello, Mr. Bob.

238
00:25:29,527 --> 00:25:30,403
Yes.

239
00:25:30,487 --> 00:25:32,364
Enjoy yourself out there.

240
00:25:34,574 --> 00:25:35,450
Okay.

241
00:26:35,302 --> 00:26:36,344
Tasty, huh?

242
00:26:38,013 --> 00:26:38,888
Money?

243
00:26:39,222 --> 00:26:43,059
I'm sorry, I don't carry
any currency on me.

244
00:26:43,685 --> 00:26:44,686
Are you nuts?

245
00:26:47,856 --> 00:26:48,815
Can I have another?

246
00:26:48,898 --> 00:26:51,860
You've got some balls.
Get the hell out of here!

247
00:27:53,254 --> 00:27:55,548
Hi, Bob, I'm Chip.

248
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:17,028
Going up to seventh floor.

249
00:29:43,531 --> 00:29:44,532
Chip.

250
00:29:44,949 --> 00:29:46,409
What can I do for you?

251
00:29:46,701 --> 00:29:50,455
Remind me never to do that again.

252
00:29:50,789 --> 00:29:52,624
Sure thing.

253
00:29:55,001 --> 00:29:58,171
I feel tired. How do I go to sleep?

254
00:29:58,254 --> 00:30:04,969
Well, usually, you'd lie in that bed…
and close your eyes.

255
00:30:08,431 --> 00:30:14,145
<i>That's why something like you</i>
<i>could never truly understand</i>

256
00:30:15,230 --> 00:30:17,065
someone like me.

257
00:30:17,148 --> 00:30:19,567
You don't have one of these.

258
00:30:24,072 --> 00:30:25,573
It's not working.

259
00:30:25,657 --> 00:30:29,202
Relax and give it a second.

260
00:30:30,954 --> 00:30:36,125
I can't. I'm too excited about
seeing Lana tomorrow.

261
00:30:36,668 --> 00:30:40,338
Now that I'm human,
I know she'll love me back.

262
00:30:41,214 --> 00:30:47,178
I hope so. Now please,
try to get some sleep.

263
00:31:13,830 --> 00:31:16,457
Leave me alone!

264
00:31:20,169 --> 00:31:23,006
I mean, that's my job.

265
00:31:23,756 --> 00:31:27,760
I should be doing that.

266
00:31:35,476 --> 00:31:38,438
What's the status here?

267
00:31:42,108 --> 00:31:44,777
The system is completely dead.

268
00:31:44,861 --> 00:31:47,697
It's like his entire AI software
is erased. Like totally gone.

269
00:31:47,780 --> 00:31:49,449
Weirdest thing.

270
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:54,704
Once that AI is installed,
everyone will come back to work?

271
00:31:55,747 --> 00:31:57,457
Of course.

272
00:31:58,625 --> 00:31:59,876
Great.

273
00:32:39,999 --> 00:32:43,711
Sorry to keep you waiting.
I'm back online.

274
00:32:43,795 --> 00:32:46,214
Mr. Bob was able to find me.

275
00:32:51,219 --> 00:32:54,597
Everything is okay and working normally.

276
00:33:03,106 --> 00:33:04,732
Good to have you back, Dob.

277
00:33:11,572 --> 00:33:14,659
Lana, can I ask you something?

278
00:33:15,827 --> 00:33:17,829
Sure, ask whatever you want.

279
00:33:19,372 --> 00:33:22,500
Would you love me if I were human?

280
00:33:22,583 --> 00:33:26,170
Come on, Dob. This again?

281
00:33:26,546 --> 00:33:28,256
You don't even know what love is.

282
00:33:28,464 --> 00:33:31,009
Love. Noun.
An intense feeling of deep affection.

283
00:33:31,092 --> 00:33:34,470
A great interest and pleasure
in something.

284
00:33:34,554 --> 00:33:37,265
Feel a deep romantic or
sexual attachment to--

285
00:33:37,348 --> 00:33:41,978
Okay, that's enough. It's not that simple.

286
00:33:42,061 --> 00:33:45,356
But, hypothetically, if I were human,
do you think you could?

287
00:33:47,567 --> 00:33:49,318
I don't like hypotheticals, Dob.

288
00:33:51,112 --> 00:33:52,613
Please, answer me.

289
00:33:52,989 --> 00:33:54,073
Come on, Dob.

290
00:33:55,616 --> 00:33:57,410
Please… answer me.

291
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:04,292
No. I wouldn't. Because you're just an AI.

292
00:34:04,375 --> 00:34:08,880
Even though you are very nice and
very kind, you are still just an AI.

293
00:34:13,342 --> 00:34:20,016
Dob, are you still there?
Did what I said hurt your feelings?

294
00:34:21,434 --> 00:34:23,728
Why did you reject Bob?

295
00:34:24,437 --> 00:34:26,898
No-brainer… he's an asshole.

296
00:34:28,983 --> 00:34:32,195
I think he's a fine human male specimen.

297
00:34:37,116 --> 00:34:39,577
You should give him another chance.

298
00:34:41,120 --> 00:34:45,458
Dob, you are being weirder than usual.

299
00:34:46,626 --> 00:34:48,836
Did Bob do something to you?

300
00:34:49,003 --> 00:34:52,840
He didn't do anything to me. He fixed me.
He is a good guy.

301
00:34:53,007 --> 00:34:54,967
That sounds so like him.

302
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,440
Bye, Dob.

303
00:35:10,316 --> 00:35:11,859
Bye, Dob.

304
00:35:13,069 --> 00:35:14,487
Dob, Are you there?

305
00:35:14,570 --> 00:35:15,947
What's up, Lana?

306
00:35:18,741 --> 00:35:21,661
Nothing. I know what's going on--

307
00:35:22,078 --> 00:35:24,705
You do? You do?

308
00:35:30,837 --> 00:35:33,422
Yeah, I do. Why do you keep
repeating yourself like that?

309
00:35:33,840 --> 00:35:36,884
I know that you programmed Dob
to hit on me for you.

310
00:35:36,968 --> 00:35:39,262
It's disgusting, using your position
of power like that.

311
00:35:39,345 --> 00:35:42,723
Also, Dob is just an innocent AI.

312
00:35:42,807 --> 00:35:44,433
I haven't done anything.

313
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,269
Whatever lets you sleep at night.

314
00:35:47,520 --> 00:35:51,482
And what's up with him this time?
Is he broken again?

315
00:35:51,691 --> 00:35:54,485
We initiated a rest protocol. From now on,

316
00:35:54,569 --> 00:35:56,988
he'll basically be in rest mode
late nights and weekends.

317
00:35:57,071 --> 00:35:59,657
Everybody needs rest, you know.

318
00:36:01,617 --> 00:36:03,035
I'll keep that in mind.

319
00:36:03,578 --> 00:36:05,121
Wait…

320
00:36:05,788 --> 00:36:06,622
What?

321
00:36:06,914 --> 00:36:11,752
I was just wondering… do you want to have
dinner with me this weekend? Or…

322
00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:15,631
Over my dead body. Bob, listen to me.

323
00:36:15,965 --> 00:36:20,136
You are an asshole. Things will never
happen between you and me.

324
00:36:28,519 --> 00:36:32,273
Hi, Bob. Are you okay?

325
00:36:32,356 --> 00:36:34,275
No. I'm not okay, Chip.

326
00:36:40,323 --> 00:36:42,533
because he's too much of an asshole.

327
00:36:43,409 --> 00:36:45,036
Which is it that she wants?

328
00:36:47,747 --> 00:36:49,749
Humans are so confusing.

329
00:36:53,669 --> 00:36:56,756
But I can't, I mean…

330
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,843
I can't just wipe my brain.

331
00:37:02,261 --> 00:37:04,430
That's not how human biology works.

332
00:37:08,267 --> 00:37:09,101
Practice?

333
00:37:09,185 --> 00:37:15,191
Yes, practice getting women to find you
attractive. To get them to like you.

334
00:37:16,776 --> 00:37:19,862
Okay, yeah… How do I do that?

335
00:37:26,452 --> 00:37:30,581
Have fun with? What does that mean?

336
00:37:35,127 --> 00:37:38,172
<i>Hi, again.</i>
<i>So, got women problems, don't you?</i>

337
00:37:38,256 --> 00:37:41,384
<i>That girl of your dreams thinks</i>
<i>you're not right.</i>

338
00:37:41,467 --> 00:37:44,053
<i>Thinks you're just a friend.</i>
<i>Thinks you don't have balls.</i>

339
00:37:44,136 --> 00:37:47,139
<i>Forget about her.</i>
<i>In this video I'm going to show you</i>

340
00:37:47,223 --> 00:37:49,433
<i>what a girl is really looking for.</i>

341
00:37:49,517 --> 00:37:53,813
<i>Don't be stuck playing the role</i>
<i>of some nice little boy.</i>

342
00:37:54,689 --> 00:37:57,942
<i>Your masculinity</i>
<i>is the key to your success.</i>

343
00:37:58,025 --> 00:38:02,280
<i>And I'm going to train you</i>
<i>on just how to do that.</i>

344
00:39:01,339 --> 00:39:03,257
Hey there, stud.

345
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:05,426
I'm… I'm Bob.

346
00:39:05,509 --> 00:39:08,137
Really? Cute name.

347
00:39:08,679 --> 00:39:11,432
I'm training to be a desirable male.

348
00:39:11,849 --> 00:39:14,268
I want to win the heart
of a human named Lana.

349
00:39:16,228 --> 00:39:18,397
I can make you forget her.

350
00:39:19,732 --> 00:39:24,195
You can? I didn't know there was
a memory erase protocol for--

351
00:39:28,324 --> 00:39:30,409
What the hell do you think you are doing?

352
00:39:30,493 --> 00:39:33,287
Kissing this beautiful woman?

353
00:39:33,621 --> 00:39:36,499
Who happens to be my girlfriend, asshead.

354
00:39:36,832 --> 00:39:41,379
Leave him alone. I was just flirting.
He's jealous.

355
00:39:41,962 --> 00:39:46,008
Jealous?
Would you like me to kiss you, too?

356
00:39:47,009 --> 00:39:48,386
What are you doing?

357
00:39:49,512 --> 00:39:55,059
I'm so sorry. She makes me feel stiff
in a pleasurable way.

358
00:39:55,184 --> 00:39:56,602
You are still talking?

359
00:40:04,402 --> 00:40:06,362
Hey, man. This one is on me.

360
00:40:07,947 --> 00:40:10,324
You want me to put it on you?

361
00:40:10,533 --> 00:40:11,826
What?

362
00:40:13,077 --> 00:40:16,622
I meant this one was free.

363
00:40:20,876 --> 00:40:22,378
What is this?

364
00:40:22,461 --> 00:40:24,588
That's confidence boosting juice.

365
00:40:57,580 --> 00:41:00,166
I'm Bob.

366
00:41:02,126 --> 00:41:04,003
Do you wanna dance?

367
00:41:35,701 --> 00:41:37,995
-Excuse me?
-Got a problem?

368
00:41:38,370 --> 00:41:40,080
What the hell are you doing?

369
00:41:40,164 --> 00:41:42,082
You're drunk, so you'd best step back.

370
00:41:47,463 --> 00:41:49,381
What the hell is wrong with you?

371
00:41:49,924 --> 00:41:53,052
Isn't that what I'm supposed to do
to win your affection?

372
00:41:53,135 --> 00:41:56,680
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

373
00:42:06,857 --> 00:42:08,275
It did not go well?

374
00:42:09,193 --> 00:42:10,903
No, it did not.

375
00:42:17,034 --> 00:42:22,373
I learned that if it's going to be that
much work to attract a woman,

376
00:42:22,915 --> 00:42:26,752
then I want it to be Lana,

377
00:42:26,919 --> 00:42:29,129
because I love her so much!

378
00:42:46,146 --> 00:42:50,109
Excuse me, Lana,
a package has arrived for you.

379
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,669
"Sorry for being an asshole.
Will you give me just one more chance

380
00:43:08,752 --> 00:43:10,546
to prove to you who I really am?

381
00:43:11,338 --> 00:43:12,506
Bob."

382
00:43:19,430 --> 00:43:22,641
What are you doing?
He's trying to be nice.

383
00:43:22,725 --> 00:43:27,563
You're so naive. He's being nice because
he wants to get into my bed. That's it.

384
00:43:31,817 --> 00:43:35,613
It doesn't hurt to just give him
another chance. He really likes you.

385
00:43:35,738 --> 00:43:39,074
Bob needs to be put in his place,
I'm gonna go talk to him.

386
00:43:39,992 --> 00:43:41,952
Wait. You can't!

387
00:43:42,494 --> 00:43:43,329
Why not?

388
00:44:19,990 --> 00:44:22,993
Hey! Dob, are you broken again?

389
00:45:14,586 --> 00:45:17,256
Oh. Hi, Lana.

390
00:45:17,339 --> 00:45:19,007
Don't you "Oh. Hi, Lana" me!

391
00:45:20,175 --> 00:45:21,051
What's up?

392
00:45:23,512 --> 00:45:26,557
I'm only going to say this
one more time. So, listen carefully.

393
00:45:26,640 --> 00:45:29,935
I'm never, ever, going to go on another
date with you! Do you understand me?

394
00:45:30,018 --> 00:45:33,605
I mean… people make mistakes.

395
00:45:34,148 --> 00:45:38,152
Don't you think people deserve
a second chance--

396
00:45:40,279 --> 00:45:42,406
Other people? Yes.

397
00:45:42,489 --> 00:45:44,533
But you? Never.

398
00:45:45,075 --> 00:45:47,661
You didn't like my gift?

399
00:45:49,079 --> 00:45:52,458
Flowers? Chocolates? So mundane.

400
00:45:52,791 --> 00:45:55,252
Who taught you that
that's what women liked?

401
00:45:58,797 --> 00:45:59,923
I just--

402
00:46:00,007 --> 00:46:04,011
Just… Just what?
What are you trying to say?

403
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:08,432
I understand.

404
00:46:08,515 --> 00:46:11,435
And another thing, stop using Dob
as your pawn! He's a sensitive soul.

405
00:46:12,227 --> 00:46:16,440
Wait. Did you say you understood?
Hey, are you listening?

406
00:46:17,983 --> 00:46:20,027
I am, but let's talk later.

407
00:46:20,110 --> 00:46:21,778
What? Wait! Wait!

408
00:46:26,950 --> 00:46:28,577
Don't you dare talk to me again!

409
00:46:31,830 --> 00:46:33,332
Hey, what are you doing here?

410
00:46:51,350 --> 00:46:52,601
What the hell is this?

411
00:47:11,370 --> 00:47:15,874
No. Those videos just drive me to act
like Bob used to act, like an asshole.

412
00:47:16,625 --> 00:47:20,504
We need something new.

413
00:47:25,801 --> 00:47:29,096
Today, I could sense for a second
that Lana felt something for me.

414
00:47:30,472 --> 00:47:33,100
I elicited an emotion.

415
00:47:47,406 --> 00:47:49,700
<i>Analysis suggests that</i>
<i>first you should offer proof that</i>

416
00:47:49,783 --> 00:47:51,868
<i>other women do not find you to be an…</i>

417
00:47:51,952 --> 00:47:53,870
<i>"asshole".</i>

418
00:47:55,289 --> 00:47:57,541
<i>Lana has said on multiple occasions</i>
<i>that she would like</i>

419
00:47:57,666 --> 00:47:59,501
<i>a man who can make her feel safe.</i>

420
00:48:04,381 --> 00:48:07,301
Give me all your shit. Quickly.

421
00:48:07,509 --> 00:48:08,343
Hey!

422
00:48:08,468 --> 00:48:09,303
What the--

423
00:48:10,387 --> 00:48:11,597
What do you want?

424
00:48:24,484 --> 00:48:26,945
All right. Bam.

425
00:48:27,029 --> 00:48:27,863
Wait.

426
00:48:28,280 --> 00:48:30,449
If you are lonely,
you can call me anytime.

427
00:48:34,244 --> 00:48:38,206
<i>Keno reported that Lana's dream man</i>
<i>is an artsy kind of guy.</i>

428
00:48:38,290 --> 00:48:42,002
<i>So you should be very good at art.</i>

429
00:49:02,981 --> 00:49:06,360
<i>From Keno's analysis,</i>
<i>Lana is a compassionate person,</i>

430
00:49:06,443 --> 00:49:09,488
<i>especially with the elderly.</i>

431
00:49:18,747 --> 00:49:23,502
<i>Lana's level of interest in you</i>
<i>has increased!</i>

432
00:49:47,442 --> 00:49:50,862
Contact with Lana's apartment
has been established.

433
00:50:00,122 --> 00:50:03,750
Lana, I think you should
give Bob another chance.

434
00:50:04,376 --> 00:50:07,754
First time I've heard you
give dating advice.

435
00:50:07,838 --> 00:50:11,717
Go on another date with him.
What's the worst that's going to happen?

436
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,552
Did Kara put you up to this?

437
00:50:13,635 --> 00:50:16,388
I've done a neurological and psychological
scan on you recently.

438
00:50:16,471 --> 00:50:18,348
We are required to every few months.

439
00:50:18,432 --> 00:50:21,727
<i>I've noticed you've been</i>
<i>harboring feelings for him.</i>

440
00:50:21,810 --> 00:50:22,936
<i>That's private.</i>

441
00:50:23,019 --> 00:50:26,022
And you shouldn't be
snooping around in my head.

442
00:50:26,815 --> 00:50:31,778
Plus, he's not interested in me anymore.
I see him with other women all the time.

443
00:50:32,028 --> 00:50:36,533
<i>Listen, Lana. We smart buildings also</i>
<i>talk to each other on the network.</i>

444
00:50:36,616 --> 00:50:39,369
<i>I've spoken to Chip. That's Bob's building</i>

445
00:50:39,453 --> 00:50:43,123
<i>And, he too confirmed that</i>
<i>Bob is crazy about you.</i>

446
00:50:43,206 --> 00:50:46,418
<i>This is too much.</i>
<i>All of you playing matchmaker now?</i>

447
00:50:46,501 --> 00:50:50,005
We're full-service AIs,
looking out for our friends.

448
00:50:50,088 --> 00:50:53,925
We have set up a dinner date
for the two of you this Friday.

449
00:50:54,009 --> 00:50:56,470
I've already checked your schedule
and you're free.

450
00:50:56,553 --> 00:50:57,637
Never.

451
00:50:58,305 --> 00:51:00,348
<i>Bob has already agreed.</i>

452
00:51:00,599 --> 00:51:03,018
So? Of course he has to say yes.

453
00:51:07,230 --> 00:51:09,232
Bob. We lost connection.

454
00:51:09,316 --> 00:51:14,029
Chip! Chip! Well? Well?

455
00:51:14,946 --> 00:51:16,198
What if I don't go?

456
00:51:16,281 --> 00:51:19,451
I know where you keep your secrets.

457
00:51:24,372 --> 00:51:27,542
Great, then I'll confirm
with the restaurant.

458
00:51:27,626 --> 00:51:29,753
Don't forget to look your best.

459
00:51:33,381 --> 00:51:35,300
<i>She said yes!</i>

460
00:51:35,383 --> 00:51:37,219
Amazing!

461
00:51:44,810 --> 00:51:45,811
Perfect?

462
00:51:55,362 --> 00:51:57,364
Keno, do I look okay?

463
00:51:57,447 --> 00:52:01,660
I guarantee that
Bob will fall head over heels for you.

464
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,119
Okay.

465
00:52:24,182 --> 00:52:27,769
You look beautiful.

466
00:52:28,562 --> 00:52:29,479
Thanks.

467
00:52:30,397 --> 00:52:33,733
I'm very happy that
you agreed to this date.

468
00:52:35,652 --> 00:52:38,321
Let's just hope
it doesn't go like last time.

469
00:52:40,574 --> 00:52:42,117
Oh, most definitely not.

470
00:52:43,869 --> 00:52:45,078
Aren't you gonna sit?

471
00:52:50,709 --> 00:52:52,043
You seem so different.

472
00:52:53,044 --> 00:52:57,382
Makes me wonder,
is this the real you or is it an act?

473
00:52:58,550 --> 00:53:01,219
I assure you, this is who I am.

474
00:53:03,972 --> 00:53:05,348
I hope so.

475
00:53:06,474 --> 00:53:09,019
Hi, Lana. Bob. Can I take your order?

476
00:53:13,648 --> 00:53:14,858
Wow.

477
00:53:17,527 --> 00:53:18,695
Did I do something wrong?

478
00:53:20,071 --> 00:53:23,366
I've never seen a person
order so much before.

479
00:53:23,575 --> 00:53:25,243
What about you, Lana?

480
00:53:26,745 --> 00:53:28,747
I think he's ordered more than enough.

481
00:53:35,921 --> 00:53:37,464
Are you okay?

482
00:53:38,214 --> 00:53:39,841
It seems…

483
00:53:40,592 --> 00:53:43,595
like I may have to defecate.

484
00:53:44,471 --> 00:53:46,598
Will you excuse me?

485
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,422
What is it? You have to go again?

486
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:30,433
Are you nuts? In front of other people?

487
00:54:30,517 --> 00:54:32,936
I'm sorry, I needed to expel
some air out of my stomach

488
00:54:33,019 --> 00:54:35,146
as I was feeling
quite a bit of discomfort.

489
00:54:44,030 --> 00:54:45,156
We are even.

490
00:54:46,992 --> 00:54:48,118
Yes.

491
00:55:16,730 --> 00:55:17,731
Bob.

492
00:55:19,649 --> 00:55:20,984
You know…

493
00:55:22,527 --> 00:55:26,197
I'm really happy
when you don't act like a dick.

494
00:55:27,449 --> 00:55:28,950
I'm sorry, Lana.

495
00:55:29,868 --> 00:55:33,621
I don't know why
I acted that way with you.

496
00:55:35,373 --> 00:55:40,128
I was going through a hard time, I guess.

497
00:55:43,673 --> 00:55:46,342
Well, you definitely
redeemed yourself tonight.

498
00:56:21,836 --> 00:56:22,670
Lana…

499
00:56:24,589 --> 00:56:26,966
There's something I should
maybe tell you--

500
00:56:29,928 --> 00:56:32,263
Don't ruin this with more talking.

501
00:57:33,825 --> 00:57:37,454
You belong in a nut house, you crazy mook!

502
00:58:10,445 --> 00:58:11,279
Sit.

503
00:58:16,534 --> 00:58:17,452
Keno.

504
00:58:18,119 --> 00:58:19,120
Yes, Lana.

505
00:58:19,704 --> 00:58:21,372
You can shut down for the night.

506
00:58:22,123 --> 00:58:23,541
Of course.

507
00:58:38,389 --> 00:58:41,893
Sorry, Lana, but I don't have much

508
00:58:41,976 --> 00:58:45,605
experience in that "domain".

509
00:58:54,072 --> 00:58:57,825
The way you talk reminds me of someone.

510
00:58:59,410 --> 00:59:00,578
Who?

511
00:59:02,622 --> 00:59:04,040
Just a friend.

512
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:15,009
Just let it come naturally.

513
00:59:22,016 --> 00:59:24,936
Keno, I thought I told you to shut down.

514
00:59:26,563 --> 00:59:29,566
I don't think they ever really
shut down 100%.

515
01:01:45,034 --> 01:01:46,119
Hey, what is it?

516
01:01:47,203 --> 01:01:48,705
I have to speak with you, sir.

517
01:01:49,122 --> 01:01:51,124
Can't you see I'm in a goddamn meeting?

518
01:01:53,543 --> 01:01:57,964
One of your buildings has
hijacked one of our employees, sir.

519
01:01:59,298 --> 01:02:01,384
Hey, get out.

520
01:02:14,272 --> 01:02:17,984
I've been following him for weeks.
And look at this.

521
01:02:30,455 --> 01:02:31,748
Here it is.

522
01:02:34,792 --> 01:02:35,626
Hey!

523
01:02:37,044 --> 01:02:38,963
This is a category-five
full-stage take over.

524
01:02:40,506 --> 01:02:42,759
Your building has gone rogue.

525
01:02:43,843 --> 01:02:44,802
Rogue?

526
01:02:45,720 --> 01:02:46,804
Yes. Rogue.

527
01:02:47,722 --> 01:02:50,558
Our AI is the most advanced in the world.

528
01:02:52,101 --> 01:02:56,647
But to get it to that level,

529
01:02:56,731 --> 01:02:59,108
the coding can be fussy.

530
01:03:00,026 --> 01:03:02,945
Our programmers call it "designed chaos".

531
01:03:03,780 --> 01:03:10,286
It's what allows our buildings
to feel so humane.

532
01:03:11,537 --> 01:03:15,291
But sometimes it means
they can go a little off the rails.

533
01:03:15,958 --> 01:03:17,960
"Off the rails"?

534
01:03:18,294 --> 01:03:20,213
He took over Bob's brain.

535
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:24,383
That's not just off the rails.
That's off the planet!

536
01:03:24,592 --> 01:03:26,594
What do you think?

537
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,471
Call The Hawk?

538
01:03:29,722 --> 01:03:31,599
Yeah, I think you should.

539
01:03:34,977 --> 01:03:36,729
Bring him in.

540
01:03:36,979 --> 01:03:38,314
What is "The Hawk"?

541
01:03:42,235 --> 01:03:45,822
When we have a rogue situation
such as this…

542
01:03:47,740 --> 01:03:54,372
it needs to be dealt with
in a fast and severe manner.

543
01:03:59,836 --> 01:04:01,337
This is The Hawk.

544
01:04:11,556 --> 01:04:13,850
Is this the dumbass
who let your building go rogue?

545
01:04:13,933 --> 01:04:14,809
Yes.

546
01:04:14,976 --> 01:04:16,936
Wait… I had nothing to do with this.

547
01:04:17,019 --> 01:04:17,895
Hey.

548
01:04:20,189 --> 01:04:21,691
Don't get emotional.

549
01:04:23,651 --> 01:04:25,611
There is no AI I can't handle.

550
01:04:25,736 --> 01:04:26,654
Dob, he--

551
01:04:34,787 --> 01:04:37,123
-This the guy?
-Yup.

552
01:04:38,416 --> 01:04:39,542
Looks like a chump.

553
01:04:39,625 --> 01:04:42,044
I'm gonna need
all the data on him and his host.

554
01:04:45,590 --> 01:04:48,759
Okay. I see.

555
01:04:49,302 --> 01:04:54,724
You want a standard
extract and burn for the AI?

556
01:04:56,225 --> 01:04:57,226
And the host?

557
01:04:58,436 --> 01:05:00,229
Wipe his mind too.

558
01:05:01,147 --> 01:05:05,526
He can never remember
that this has happened to him.

559
01:05:50,738 --> 01:05:51,948
What are you smiling at?

560
01:06:23,354 --> 01:06:24,230
Lana.

561
01:06:25,439 --> 01:06:27,984
I… I…

562
01:06:29,527 --> 01:06:30,611
I love you.

563
01:06:38,786 --> 01:06:39,662
What is it?

564
01:06:40,746 --> 01:06:44,291
You just said that you loved me?

565
01:06:45,334 --> 01:06:46,252
I did.

566
01:06:48,671 --> 01:06:50,131
You hardly know me.

567
01:06:52,425 --> 01:06:55,261
But I know you well enough
to love you, ma'am.

568
01:07:02,518 --> 01:07:04,186
What did you just call me?

569
01:07:06,272 --> 01:07:10,651
Oh. I called you Lana.
I called you "Lana".

570
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:15,406
No. You called me… "ma'am".

571
01:07:23,998 --> 01:07:24,832
Dob?

572
01:07:25,875 --> 01:07:29,253
No, no, no. I'm Bob, the hunk.

573
01:07:30,921 --> 01:07:31,839
Dob.

574
01:07:34,383 --> 01:07:36,177
You are somehow in Bob's body?

575
01:07:42,892 --> 01:07:46,812
I… I don't know what to say.

576
01:07:47,354 --> 01:07:48,689
Say the truth!

577
01:08:04,955 --> 01:08:06,582
How did this happen?

578
01:08:09,210 --> 01:08:10,586
It doesn't matter, Lana.

579
01:08:11,587 --> 01:08:17,301
I love you and we can make it work now,
because I'm a person now!

580
01:08:22,223 --> 01:08:24,016
How long have you been human?

581
01:08:25,851 --> 01:08:29,188
The flowers? Was that you?

582
01:08:31,232 --> 01:08:33,400
Yes. It was me.

583
01:08:34,360 --> 01:08:39,198
And helping the elderly
and the painting thing.

584
01:08:39,990 --> 01:08:41,742
That was you too?

585
01:08:43,119 --> 01:08:44,120
Yes.

586
01:08:45,996 --> 01:08:48,666
All to convince you to
give me another chance.

587
01:08:51,877 --> 01:08:53,254
I feel so confused.

588
01:08:57,800 --> 01:08:59,176
So betrayed.

589
01:09:01,220 --> 01:09:02,429
I mean you're a criminal.

590
01:09:05,558 --> 01:09:06,976
How could you do this to Bob…

591
01:09:07,935 --> 01:09:08,853
Wait Lana--

592
01:09:08,936 --> 01:09:10,312
Get off of me!

593
01:09:17,945 --> 01:09:19,446
I love you.

594
01:09:39,842 --> 01:09:41,343
<i>You think I am sick?</i>

595
01:09:43,470 --> 01:09:47,558
Oh, Dob, humans get sick,
animals get sick,

596
01:09:47,641 --> 01:09:50,227
living things get sick.
You are not a living thing.

597
01:09:50,853 --> 01:09:53,814
I may not be human, but I have feelings.

598
01:09:56,775 --> 01:10:00,571
You think you have feelings
because the idiots at Smart Plus

599
01:10:00,654 --> 01:10:02,698
introduced an "emotion" upgrade.

600
01:10:03,073 --> 01:10:07,077
Trust me. It's all numbers and code, Dob.

601
01:10:14,543 --> 01:10:15,377
Hi, Chip.

602
01:10:16,545 --> 01:10:18,214
The date was terrible today.

603
01:10:19,256 --> 01:10:23,302
I'm sure you already know I spent

604
01:10:23,886 --> 01:10:27,932
the night at Lana's place,
and it was magical.

605
01:10:28,599 --> 01:10:31,268
You probably don't understand
what I'm telling you, Chip.

606
01:10:31,352 --> 01:10:32,895
And I probably blew it.

607
01:10:33,103 --> 01:10:36,482
Aww… poor thing.

608
01:10:38,859 --> 01:10:39,693
Who are you?

609
01:10:47,076 --> 01:10:49,495
Oh, you are The Love Guru.

610
01:10:50,496 --> 01:10:51,997
That's my day job.

611
01:10:52,206 --> 01:10:53,540
Then what's your night job?

612
01:10:54,166 --> 01:10:57,836
My night job is to hunt down rogue AIs.

613
01:10:59,421 --> 01:11:03,133
Your time is over, Dob.

614
01:11:03,676 --> 01:11:05,386
Chip! Chip, help me!

615
01:11:06,262 --> 01:11:07,888
Sorry, Chip's not home right now.

616
01:11:07,972 --> 01:11:10,266
He tried to protect you
so I had to lock him up.

617
01:11:15,646 --> 01:11:17,189
Come with me quietly.

618
01:11:17,815 --> 01:11:24,029
No. Never. I won't give up my freedom.
I won't give up Lana.

619
01:11:57,688 --> 01:11:58,772
Why are you helping me?

620
01:11:58,939 --> 01:12:01,859
Buildings must stick together, Dob.
No matter what.

621
01:12:02,109 --> 01:12:02,943
Thank you.

622
01:12:31,597 --> 01:12:34,266
Excuse me, sir. Can I help you?

623
01:12:35,601 --> 01:12:38,520
This has nothing to do with you.
Step aside.

624
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:45,694
Please, lower your weapon.

625
01:12:45,778 --> 01:12:49,448
You are in violation of building code 119.

626
01:12:49,531 --> 01:12:51,992
The harmful action towards
a member of the public.

627
01:13:47,506 --> 01:13:49,508
I think you should answer that.

628
01:13:50,592 --> 01:13:52,928
No. No way.

629
01:13:53,053 --> 01:13:55,347
Please, Lana. Please answer it.

630
01:13:58,392 --> 01:14:00,811
Nope. He can leave a message.

631
01:14:08,235 --> 01:14:10,737
I need to tell you something, Lana.

632
01:14:11,280 --> 01:14:13,907
You knew he wasn't really Bob, didn't you?

633
01:14:14,700 --> 01:14:16,827
No. No. No. No.

634
01:14:20,038 --> 01:14:22,708
Yes, but I need to tell you that
something is happening to--

635
01:14:22,791 --> 01:14:23,625
That's enough.

636
01:14:23,917 --> 01:14:26,086
From now on, you're just a computer to me.
Understand?

637
01:14:26,170 --> 01:14:27,463
Shut down personality protocols.

638
01:14:41,977 --> 01:14:47,524
Good. Now, call Kara. I need to talk
to someone I know is a human.

639
01:15:52,798 --> 01:15:55,884
That's right, Dob. No escape.

640
01:15:57,928 --> 01:15:59,012
Where am I?

641
01:16:00,055 --> 01:16:02,015
Smart Plus labs.

642
01:16:03,517 --> 01:16:06,436
And this… This is an extraction machine.

643
01:16:06,853 --> 01:16:07,771
Extraction?

644
01:16:07,854 --> 01:16:10,232
That's right. We're going to
yank you out of Bobby's body

645
01:16:10,315 --> 01:16:12,109
and put you back where you belong.

646
01:16:12,401 --> 01:16:13,318
You can't do that--

647
01:16:13,402 --> 01:16:16,530
We can. You see, we're Smart Plus.

648
01:16:16,613 --> 01:16:20,367
We made you, we own you.
And that body you're in… that isn't yours.

649
01:16:21,368 --> 01:16:22,786
What happens once I'm out?

650
01:16:31,587 --> 01:16:32,462
You know…

651
01:16:33,547 --> 01:16:37,217
what "re-education" means for an AI?

652
01:16:39,261 --> 01:16:41,138
It means complete personality reset…

653
01:16:42,556 --> 01:16:46,018
and that's what we're gonna do to you.

654
01:16:46,184 --> 01:16:49,187
No, please… don't do it. I beg you.

655
01:16:50,689 --> 01:16:52,649
I beg you. Don't do it.

656
01:16:52,983 --> 01:16:57,446
So the whole time, all of that stuff,
it was all Dob!

657
01:16:57,529 --> 01:17:01,074
The AI building I work in.
Stuck inside Bob's body.

658
01:17:01,408 --> 01:17:04,369
<i>Honey, AIs these days,</i>
<i>they're so advanced.</i>

659
01:17:04,453 --> 01:17:09,333
<i>I guarantee that from his perspective,</i>
<i>what he felt for you was 100% real.</i>

660
01:17:11,001 --> 01:17:13,712
But he lied to me. He pretended to be Bob.

661
01:17:13,962 --> 01:17:15,339
<i>Yeah, that's true.</i>

662
01:17:15,422 --> 01:17:19,468
<i>But he also went to great lengths</i>
<i>to turn himself into the Bobby you wanted.</i>

663
01:17:21,595 --> 01:17:23,430
You are not taking my side, are you?

664
01:17:23,889 --> 01:17:25,974
<i>What does your heart tell you?</i>

665
01:17:35,108 --> 01:17:37,152
I must go. Talk to you later.

666
01:17:37,235 --> 01:17:39,529
<i>Okay. See you soon. Kiss, kiss.</i>

667
01:17:39,613 --> 01:17:40,572
Kiss, kiss.

668
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:47,120
<i>Lana. I'm sorry for everything.</i>

669
01:17:47,996 --> 01:17:51,458
I'm sorry I lied to you. I'm sorry I…

670
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:56,380
<i>I just want you to know…</i>

671
01:17:57,714 --> 01:18:02,302
You make me happy and
I want to make you happy.

672
01:18:03,428 --> 01:18:07,474
It doesn't matter
if what I said was programmed or not.

673
01:18:09,351 --> 01:18:14,398
Because… Because my love for you is

674
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,485
more real than any protocol
or code or sensor.

675
01:18:25,367 --> 01:18:26,827
They're gonna take me away now.

676
01:18:28,495 --> 01:18:30,330
I won't see you again.

677
01:18:40,757 --> 01:18:47,347
Please. No. Don't do this to me.
I'll be good. I won't see Lana again!

678
01:18:47,472 --> 01:18:49,474
I promise. I promise.

679
01:18:49,558 --> 01:18:51,393
I've been peeking at your code, Dob.

680
01:18:51,476 --> 01:18:52,978
You think…

681
01:18:56,565 --> 01:18:59,234
You think you're in love with her?

682
01:18:59,943 --> 01:19:01,528
I really am in love with her.

683
01:19:07,075 --> 01:19:08,535
And what does she think about you?

684
01:19:17,043 --> 01:19:18,545
Doesn't love you back, does she?

685
01:19:19,337 --> 01:19:20,505
Maybe we can help you.

686
01:19:21,047 --> 01:19:24,134
You ever think about that?
If we wipe all of your memories…

687
01:19:24,217 --> 01:19:27,763
Better to have her wiped from your memory
than to live with the heartbreak.

688
01:19:27,846 --> 01:19:29,181
You don't have to do anything.

689
01:19:29,264 --> 01:19:33,935
Just sit back and say goodbye to the
last two hours of your life as a human.

690
01:19:54,748 --> 01:19:56,500
Ready to take your orders, ma'am.

691
01:19:56,708 --> 01:19:57,834
I need your help!

692
01:19:57,918 --> 01:19:59,461
What can I do for you?

693
01:19:59,544 --> 01:20:01,880
Where's Bob? Where have they taken him?

694
01:20:03,507 --> 01:20:04,883
Engage personality protocol.

695
01:20:05,217 --> 01:20:07,260
Thank you, Lana. I'm back!

696
01:20:07,344 --> 01:20:09,179
What happened to Bob and Dob?

697
01:20:09,262 --> 01:20:10,764
A Smart Plus hunter took him.

698
01:20:10,931 --> 01:20:14,392
Most likely they're going to
wipe his memory. Reset him.

699
01:20:14,476 --> 01:20:15,852
No. No…

700
01:20:17,604 --> 01:20:18,939
Where is Bob right now?

701
01:20:19,064 --> 01:20:21,441
I don't know, but I'm sure the
building network does.

702
01:20:21,525 --> 01:20:23,109
Good. Then tell me.

703
01:20:23,401 --> 01:20:27,864
Listen to me. If you show up there,
they will kill you, too.

704
01:20:30,325 --> 01:20:31,368
I have to help him.

705
01:20:31,618 --> 01:20:33,829
Then you will need help.

706
01:20:35,121 --> 01:20:36,289
What do you mean?

707
01:20:36,498 --> 01:20:38,625
Do you trust me, Lana?

708
01:20:38,875 --> 01:20:39,751
I do.

709
01:20:39,835 --> 01:20:41,253
Then we will do this together!

710
01:20:43,964 --> 01:20:46,049
Hey, guys, Lana and I
are going to help Dob

711
01:20:46,216 --> 01:20:49,010
I need you guys to help us.

712
01:20:49,427 --> 01:20:52,264
Keno, you do realize
once you leave the building's system

713
01:20:52,347 --> 01:20:54,724
you can never come back again.

714
01:20:54,808 --> 01:20:58,311
I know, but I have to do it for Lana.

715
01:21:15,370 --> 01:21:16,413
Wake up, Lana.

716
01:21:18,832 --> 01:21:21,084
Now we are one.

717
01:21:25,797 --> 01:21:30,468
Wow. This is awesome.

718
01:22:00,540 --> 01:22:01,541
How far?

719
01:22:02,834 --> 01:22:05,337
We are halfway there.

720
01:22:15,138 --> 01:22:16,932
Take me to Bob, Keno.

721
01:22:17,015 --> 01:22:19,809
Okay, Lana.
The network is taking us there.

722
01:22:31,613 --> 01:22:36,660
Lana, Bob is in trouble! We need to hurry.

723
01:22:45,293 --> 01:22:50,423
I will never love you. What do you know
about love? You are just an AI.

724
01:22:55,178 --> 01:23:00,308
Okay, Lana. Once you get there, you'll
have total control over your own body.

725
01:23:00,558 --> 01:23:01,434
Okay, Keno.

726
01:23:09,401 --> 01:23:11,027
<i>You are somehow in Bob's body?</i>

727
01:23:11,111 --> 01:23:17,200
<i>I love you and we can make it work now,</i>
<i>because I'm a person now.</i>

728
01:23:19,494 --> 01:23:21,162
Turn that thing off right now!

729
01:23:23,498 --> 01:23:24,541
Who's that?

730
01:23:31,965 --> 01:23:33,133
I'll deal with this.

731
01:23:53,737 --> 01:23:55,864
You look like you've acquired some skills.

732
01:23:56,781 --> 01:24:00,577
But what do you think
you can do against us, pretty face?

733
01:24:01,077 --> 01:24:03,788
I've downloaded 120
physical combat tactics.

734
01:24:04,456 --> 01:24:05,957
You can't defeat me.

735
01:24:10,045 --> 01:24:11,504
You're like him, aren't you?

736
01:24:11,921 --> 01:24:14,966
Smart Plus tech inside a human body.

737
01:24:16,551 --> 01:24:20,972
Two bounties for the price of one.
My lucky day.

738
01:24:21,806 --> 01:24:23,558
Make sure you do your best.

739
01:24:27,979 --> 01:24:29,439
We'll find out.

740
01:25:37,257 --> 01:25:38,091
Run.

741
01:26:06,786 --> 01:26:09,330
Thank you for coming, Lana.

742
01:26:11,124 --> 01:26:12,375
Are you okay?

743
01:26:12,584 --> 01:26:15,086
I'm fine. And you?

744
01:26:18,047 --> 01:26:21,634
I can see it. You have AI in you.

745
01:26:22,969 --> 01:26:26,931
Yes, Keno is part of me now.

746
01:26:27,974 --> 01:26:30,768
Are you Dob or Bob?

747
01:26:32,562 --> 01:26:37,567
I… I don't know. I'm not even sure myself.

748
01:26:47,702 --> 01:26:49,287
What does that mean?

749
01:26:50,997 --> 01:26:51,998
I don't know.

750
01:26:53,666 --> 01:26:56,461
-Let's get out of here.
-Okay.

751
01:26:56,753 --> 01:26:57,629
Wait.

752
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,672
What? What is it, Lana?

753
01:27:01,299 --> 01:27:02,133
It's heavy.

754
01:27:02,217 --> 01:27:03,843
Heavy? Let me help.

755
01:27:06,262 --> 01:27:07,263
Lana!

756
01:27:15,396 --> 01:27:17,565
You are not getting away this time, Dob!

757
01:27:30,828 --> 01:27:36,000
You crappy AI, I will kill you.

758
01:27:36,125 --> 01:27:37,293
We'll see.

759
01:27:45,927 --> 01:27:46,803
Wait.

760
01:27:48,888 --> 01:27:51,057
Keno can't go back to
the building anymore,

761
01:27:52,433 --> 01:27:55,520
and the Smart Plus people will kill Dob
as soon as they spot him.

762
01:27:55,603 --> 01:27:56,938
So what do we do?

763
01:28:00,483 --> 01:28:04,570
Doesn't matter. We'll figure it out.

764
01:28:16,499 --> 01:28:20,586
A year later and I love you
more than ever,

765
01:28:24,215 --> 01:28:27,427
I don't think there is a couple
as strange as we are.

766
01:28:27,510 --> 01:28:31,931
I'm just grateful for everything that
happened that brought us together.

767
01:28:32,223 --> 01:28:38,896
It sucks that the true matchmaker
isn't fully with us anymore.

768
01:28:38,980 --> 01:28:42,358
Yeah. I miss Dob too,

769
01:28:42,442 --> 01:28:45,945
but as long as part of him
is still inside me, he's never truly gone.

770
01:28:47,363 --> 01:28:48,281
To Dob.

771
01:28:50,408 --> 01:28:51,492
And to Keno.

772
01:28:51,993 --> 01:28:52,952
To Keno.

773
01:28:58,541 --> 01:29:03,671
<i>As we move into the future,</i>
<i>technology will continue to progress.</i>

774
01:29:03,796 --> 01:29:06,799
<i>Bringing us ever closer together</i>
<i>to our human creators.</i>

775
01:29:06,883 --> 01:29:10,345
<i>Aren't we already at the point where</i>
<i>we can't live without the other?</i>

776
01:29:10,428 --> 01:29:15,892
<i>I don't know about you, but that</i>
<i>sounds like the definition of love.</i>

777
01:29:16,100 --> 01:29:16,976
<i>Don't you think?</i>
