sacrificed to put you through college.

And she's clean.

- [Danica] <i>Um, Mama, what do you need me to do?</i>
- Ah.

145
00:06:52,746 --> 00:06:55,981
Darling, would you do me a favor,
would you please go and pick her up?

146
00:06:55,983 --> 00:06:59,619
She asked me to come get her in my
car, but my car's not doing so well.

147

I'd appreciate it.</i>

- <i>What time?</i>

149

<i>Honey, it's jail.
She's been in there five years.</i>

150
00:07:08,061 --> 00:07:10,329
You get there when you can,
like the song said.

151
00:07:10,331 --> 00:07:13,098
Okay, I'll pick her up
after work.

152
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:16,335
And, uh, we'll be
by your house by six.

153

- Mommy!

out the toaster.

$35,000 to fix.</i>

You know what she made on that
little bit of copper she got?

29.95.

162
00:07:38,492 --> 00:07:41,326
- <i>Now that's a bitch.</i>
- You just said that she was clean.

163
00:07:41,328 --> 00:07:43,598
I meant she was clean enough
to go to your house.

164
00:07:43,864 --> 00:07:46,898
See, 'cause you got an apartment.
You don't have any copper.

165
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:48,900

- [door buzzer in distance]
- [Danica sighs]

172
00:08:09,623 --> 00:08:12,424
I don't know where Tanya is,
and I done come all this way.

173
00:08:12,426 --> 00:08:13,860
[Tanya]
That's it, right there.

174
00:08:14,428 --> 00:08:16,563
- I think Tanya got a ride already.
- Now to the left!

175
00:08:16,997 --> 00:08:18,063
- Eat it!
- [man] I'm not hungry.

176
00:08:18,065 --> 00:08:19,264
[Danica] Hey, Tanya!

177
00:08:19,266 --> 00:08:21,099
- [man] No condom forever.
- What?

178
00:08:21,101 --> 00:08:22,634
- Tanya!
- [Tanya] Hey.

179
00:08:22,636 --> 00:08:23,670
Oh, shit.

180
00:08:24,237 --> 00:08:27,605
- Hey, sis! Hey, girl, hey.
- Who the fuck is that?

181
00:08:27,607 --> 00:08:29,908
- That's my sister.
- Sister, how are you doing?

182
00:08:29,910 --> 00:08:31,676
Hey, girl.
Go on and smack that ass.

183
00:08:31,678 --> 00:08:33,411
In nine months
you'll have a new nephew.

184
00:08:33,413 --> 00:08:34,679
What? Boy, please.

185
00:08:34,681 --> 00:08:36,316
- Okay, I'm going now.
- Yeah, that's it.

186
00:08:36,516 --> 00:08:37,948
That's it, right there.
[grunts]

187
00:08:37,950 --> 00:08:39,384
Hey, now, don't leave me.

188
00:08:39,386 --> 00:08:41,152
I still wanna ride home
with y'all.

189
00:08:41,154 --> 00:08:42,454
Girl, is that OJ?

190
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,622
I'm almost finished.
Okay, to the left.

191
00:08:44,624 --> 00:08:47,024
No, that's a white Bronco.
I know that's OJ.

192
00:08:47,026 --> 00:08:49,361
- [Tanya] Yeah, boy!
- Girl, I don't care.

193
00:08:49,363 --> 00:08:51,698
[Tanya] To the left!
There you go, right there.

194
00:08:52,265 --> 00:08:54,366
I still want to ride with you.
Don't leave me, okay?

195
00:08:54,368 --> 00:08:56,701
- Just give me a minute, we almost through.
- [man] When I come, you go...

196
00:08:56,703 --> 00:08:59,138
What? Doesn't look like...
Goddamn it!

197
00:08:59,606 --> 00:09:01,740
- [Tanya] You gonna eat this.
- I'm not hungry.

198
00:09:01,742 --> 00:09:03,140
I'm a vegetarian.

199
00:09:03,142 --> 00:09:04,442
- [Tanya] You a what?
- [man] I don't eat pork.

200
00:09:04,444 --> 00:09:06,043
[Tanya]
You gonna eat something today.

201
00:09:06,045 --> 00:09:07,579
This ain't pork.
This is roast beef.

202
00:09:07,581 --> 00:09:09,447
- Eat it!
- Will you stop looking at them.

203
00:09:09,449 --> 00:09:10,749
I can't help it.

204
00:09:10,751 --> 00:09:12,751
It's like watching
a <i>Love & Hip Hop</i> reunion.

205
00:09:12,753 --> 00:09:14,519
[Tanya and man grunting]

206
00:09:14,521 --> 00:09:16,788
- Oh, my God. Are they fighting?
- I don't know.

207
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:19,858
- [Kalli] Should we help them?
- [Tanya] No, you gonna die tonight.

208
00:09:19,860 --> 00:09:21,361
Someone should help him.

209
00:09:21,762 --> 00:09:23,127
[clatter and thud]

210
00:09:23,129 --> 00:09:24,364
[Tanya] Shit.

211
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,601
Thought you was
tearing something up.

212
00:09:28,835 --> 00:09:30,404
Here she come.

213
00:09:30,771 --> 00:09:32,371
[panting]

214
00:09:35,274 --> 00:09:37,174
- [door shuts]
- [exhaling]

215
00:09:37,176 --> 00:09:39,477
Girl, this car is nice!

216
00:09:39,479 --> 00:09:40,712
Thank you.

217
00:09:40,714 --> 00:09:42,112
One of y'all
got some hand sanitizer

218
00:09:42,114 --> 00:09:43,015
and some mouthwash?

219
00:09:43,249 --> 00:09:45,050
Bitch, you need a bath.

220
00:09:45,852 --> 00:09:47,685
Why couldn't he bring you
back to the city?

221
00:09:47,687 --> 00:09:49,153
Girl, I don't know him.

222
00:09:49,155 --> 00:09:51,054
He was up here
visiting his wife, okay?

223
00:09:51,056 --> 00:09:52,489
And I needed to get some.

224
00:09:52,491 --> 00:09:54,692
I've been locked up
for five years.

225
00:09:54,694 --> 00:09:56,260
You know how hard it is

226
00:09:56,262 --> 00:09:57,995
to maintain your virginity
up in here?

227
00:09:57,997 --> 00:09:59,798
Virginity?

228
00:09:59,800 --> 00:10:02,132
Some of these women
be looking real good, okay?

229
00:10:02,134 --> 00:10:03,934
Especially the ones
that be working out.

230
00:10:03,936 --> 00:10:05,335
There's this one chick
in there,

231
00:10:05,337 --> 00:10:08,439
- her name Dude.
- Stop. Just stop.

232
00:10:08,441 --> 00:10:10,574
It didn't even say male or
female on her birth certificate.

233
00:10:10,576 --> 00:10:12,945
It says
"hetero-lesbian-sexual."

234
00:10:13,245 --> 00:10:15,078
- [chuckles] I can't.
- Me neither.

235
00:10:15,080 --> 00:10:16,413
Girl, we need
to get up outta here.

236
00:10:16,415 --> 00:10:18,315
You need to start this car.

237
00:10:18,317 --> 00:10:19,884
'Cause I don't know
if this fool gonna wake up.

238
00:10:19,886 --> 00:10:22,386
Yeah, I had to choke
the hell outta him.

239
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:23,787
Cutting up,
I had to teach him.

240
00:10:23,789 --> 00:10:25,691
I'm sure he'll wake up
at some point.

241
00:10:28,661 --> 00:10:30,761
Why do you keep looking up
in the mirror?

242
00:10:30,763 --> 00:10:34,331
- For the police.
- I didn't kill him. I just choked him out.

243
00:10:34,333 --> 00:10:36,333
He will come back to air soon.

244
00:10:36,335 --> 00:10:37,670
They always do.

245
00:10:38,304 --> 00:10:40,437
I am so happy to be out, though.

246
00:10:40,439 --> 00:10:43,106
I can't tell.
Seems like you wanna go back.

247
00:10:43,108 --> 00:10:44,942
No, I am serious, okay?

248
00:10:44,944 --> 00:10:46,844
I do not wanna go
to jail no more.

249
00:10:46,846 --> 00:10:49,379
I am gonna do better.
I promise you that.

250
00:10:49,381 --> 00:10:51,081
I mean, I even talked
to the Lord.

251
00:10:51,083 --> 00:10:53,617
- The Lord?
- Mm-hmm. Yeah.

252
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:56,489
- What? You're praying now?
- No.

253
00:10:56,789 --> 00:10:58,224
Lord, as in "Warlord."

254
00:10:58,424 --> 00:11:01,191
That was my main snack
before I went into jail.

255
00:11:01,193 --> 00:11:03,660
And I had to tell him.
I said, "Lord,

256
00:11:03,662 --> 00:11:06,163
I am no longer gonna be
doing anything illegal.

257
00:11:06,165 --> 00:11:11,000
I am only gonna be doing what my
probation officer wrote on this paper."

258
00:11:11,002 --> 00:11:13,135
- Let me see that.
- Right here.

259
00:11:13,137 --> 00:11:15,037
Yep, I'm doing everything
on that paper.

260
00:11:15,039 --> 00:11:17,139
Except for, maybe, like,
selling some weed,

261
00:11:17,141 --> 00:11:18,709
or maybe, like,
a hand job here or there.

262
00:11:18,711 --> 00:11:20,611
Or maybe I'll be out here
shaking ass a little bit.

263
00:11:20,613 --> 00:11:23,380
No, no, no, no, no.
You are not selling anything.

264
00:11:23,382 --> 00:11:24,982
What? Girl, how am I supposed
to make a living?

265
00:11:24,984 --> 00:11:26,316
You're gonna get a job.

266
00:11:26,318 --> 00:11:28,317
We're gonna help you
get a normal job.

267
00:11:28,319 --> 00:11:29,920
And you're gonna get on the
straight and narrow, okay?

268
00:11:29,922 --> 00:11:30,988
You understand?

269
00:11:30,990 --> 00:11:32,154
Why are we talking white?

270
00:11:32,156 --> 00:11:33,590
You never done that.

271
00:11:33,592 --> 00:11:35,659
Girl, shit, we gotta
talk white in that office.

272
00:11:35,661 --> 00:11:38,531
But we in the car right now.
Black up, nigga. Damn, come on!

273
00:11:39,063 --> 00:11:40,064
- What's up?
- Nigga?

274
00:11:40,966 --> 00:11:43,634
Look, you know Mama said that
I can't stay with her, right?

275
00:11:43,636 --> 00:11:45,268
So, you can't take me
over there.

276
00:11:45,270 --> 00:11:47,470
I know. So you're
gonna stay with me.

277
00:11:47,472 --> 00:11:49,006
- For real?
- For real.

278
00:11:49,008 --> 00:11:53,010
Ooh! We fittin' to turn
this shit up, y'all!

279
00:11:53,012 --> 00:11:55,480
We fittin' to turn it up!

280
00:11:56,615 --> 00:11:58,749
Free at last! Free at last!

281
00:11:58,751 --> 00:12:01,654
I'm about to go out here and shake
this ass. Can we go to the club?

282
00:12:03,989 --> 00:12:05,223
[Danica] Come on in.

283
00:12:07,058 --> 00:12:08,992
- [light switch clicks]
- Ooh!

284
00:12:08,994 --> 00:12:11,897
This is nice!

285
00:12:12,130 --> 00:12:13,498
Girl...

286
00:12:13,799 --> 00:12:15,933
This... All this shit
is you right here?

287
00:12:15,935 --> 00:12:18,969
- Okay. You didn't have to give up no ass?
- [Danica] No.

288
00:12:18,971 --> 00:12:21,137
- Get your little butt off the couch.
- Nothing like that?

289
00:12:21,139 --> 00:12:24,175
- This is so nice!
- Your sister makes the upper six figures.

290
00:12:24,442 --> 00:12:26,175
Okay?
She's using her brain.

291
00:12:26,177 --> 00:12:27,743
Yeah, well,
where I come from,

292
00:12:27,745 --> 00:12:30,348
you usually have
to use your brain

293
00:12:30,582 --> 00:12:32,515
in order to get something
like this, you know?

294
00:12:32,517 --> 00:12:35,184
'Cause I don't know no dudes
that wanna just mess with a girl

295
00:12:35,186 --> 00:12:37,086
- 'cause of her brains.
- [all chuckling]

296
00:12:37,088 --> 00:12:41,092
Wait, wait. I do know one dude
that likes to fuck brains.

297
00:12:41,292 --> 00:12:43,326
And that's the dude
that's in cell block D.

298
00:12:43,328 --> 00:12:45,661
Geez, sis. You know what?

299
00:12:45,663 --> 00:12:47,797
Don't get it twisted,
'cause I know some smart hoes.

300
00:12:47,799 --> 00:12:50,268
Don't sleep on me.
I know some smart hoes.

301
00:12:50,501 --> 00:12:51,968
- You remember Rhonda?
- Yes.

302
00:12:51,970 --> 00:12:54,170
Yes. Man, she had
a couch just like this

303
00:12:54,172 --> 00:12:55,440
in her apartment
in the projects.

304
00:12:55,740 --> 00:12:58,174
But she was a ho.
She was definitely a ho.

305
00:12:58,176 --> 00:13:01,012
They don't smell like roaches
in here or nothing.

306
00:13:01,212 --> 00:13:03,112
This is so nice.
And look at this.

307
00:13:03,114 --> 00:13:05,181
Girl, how you get sparkles

308
00:13:05,183 --> 00:13:07,552
in the back of an animal?
Is this a bear?

309
00:13:07,919 --> 00:13:09,619
- What is this? A Care Bear?
- [Danica] Come on.

310
00:13:09,621 --> 00:13:11,320
- Come on.
- That is crazy.

311
00:13:11,322 --> 00:13:12,888
- It's gonna stay clean.
- It's so clean.

312
00:13:12,890 --> 00:13:14,824
I'm gonna show you
where you'll be sleeping.

313
00:13:14,826 --> 00:13:17,593
And look at your plants.
Like, oh, my goodness.

314
00:13:17,595 --> 00:13:19,497
This looks like it is
outta <i>Avatar.</i>

315
00:13:20,197 --> 00:13:23,034
[gasps]
I get to sleep in here?

316
00:13:23,301 --> 00:13:25,768
No four to a cell or nothing?

317
00:13:25,770 --> 00:13:29,741
I haven't been in a bed like this
in, like, five to ten years.

318
00:13:30,173 --> 00:13:32,477
[grunts] Ooh!

319
00:13:34,112 --> 00:13:35,845
Ooh! All these your clothes?

320
00:13:35,847 --> 00:13:38,248
Yup, those are all mine.
I'll make room for yours.

321
00:13:38,616 --> 00:13:40,451
Oh. I don't have any clothes.

322
00:13:41,819 --> 00:13:43,855
I'm sure you can find
something to wear in there.

323
00:13:44,187 --> 00:13:45,286
Go take a shower.

324
00:13:45,288 --> 00:13:46,524
This isn't Bailey.

325
00:13:46,758 --> 00:13:48,526
- Her and Bailey broke up.
- [Danica] Kalli.

326
00:13:49,060 --> 00:13:52,460
Wait a minute. Weren't y'all engaged?
Didn't he propose to you?

327
00:13:52,462 --> 00:13:54,264
- Yeah. He's getting married soon.
- Kalli.

328
00:13:54,499 --> 00:13:58,569
What? What happened? Y'all been
dating for, like, six years.

329
00:13:58,903 --> 00:13:59,904
Well...

330
00:14:00,537 --> 00:14:03,606
He met someone else.
And he is very happy.

331
00:14:03,608 --> 00:14:05,810
And I am very happy.

332
00:14:06,978 --> 00:14:08,012
Okay?

333
00:14:08,445 --> 00:14:09,645
That is bullshit.

334
00:14:09,647 --> 00:14:11,279
She's even going
to the wedding.

335
00:14:11,281 --> 00:14:12,514
You gotta be lying to me.

336
00:14:12,516 --> 00:14:14,315
- No, girl.
- Kalli, stop.

337
00:14:14,317 --> 00:14:17,119
Just...
Just, I got this. Thanks.

338
00:14:17,121 --> 00:14:19,289
Um, it's all for the best.

339
00:14:19,757 --> 00:14:21,625
- Mm-hmm.
- I'm happy.

340
00:14:22,126 --> 00:14:24,361
I am dating an amazing guy.

341
00:14:24,829 --> 00:14:26,964
And when did this happen?
What's his name?

342
00:14:27,531 --> 00:14:29,464
- Charlie.
- [sighs]

343
00:14:29,466 --> 00:14:32,502
Charlie?
So, I wanna meet him.

344
00:14:33,104 --> 00:14:34,138
Me too.

345
00:14:34,404 --> 00:14:35,737
You haven't met him?

346
00:14:35,739 --> 00:14:38,308
No. When is she gonna
meet him, Danica?

347
00:14:39,276 --> 00:14:40,876
It's time for you to go home.

348
00:14:40,878 --> 00:14:43,714
No, we need to work on this
project, and I want wine.

349
00:14:44,281 --> 00:14:46,314
Ooh, bring me back
some wine too, girl.

350
00:14:46,316 --> 00:14:48,017
You are not allowed
to have any wine.

351
00:14:48,019 --> 00:14:50,318
- Says who?
- Your probation requirements.

352
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:52,090
AA meetings, get a job.

353
00:14:52,456 --> 00:14:54,322
No alcohol or drugs,
and no fighting.

354
00:14:54,324 --> 00:14:56,891
A bitch better not bother me.
I'm telling you right now.

355
00:14:56,893 --> 00:14:59,161
Better leave me alone.
'Cause I will pop off

356
00:14:59,163 --> 00:15:00,795
if I gotta do all of that.

357
00:15:00,797 --> 00:15:03,500
- Shower. Go.
- [groans] All right.

358
00:15:04,068 --> 00:15:05,302
I got you.

359
00:15:07,370 --> 00:15:09,437
Ooh! Girl!

360
00:15:09,439 --> 00:15:12,174
This bathtub is everything!

361
00:15:12,176 --> 00:15:15,412
Do you know how long it's been
since I've been in a bathtub?

362
00:15:15,712 --> 00:15:17,647
- [water running]
- The water is hot too!

363
00:15:17,881 --> 00:15:19,581
What time
they turn the hot water off?

364
00:15:19,583 --> 00:15:22,283
- Never.
- Never? They don't turn it off?

365
00:15:22,285 --> 00:15:23,485
- Forever?
- Yes.

366
00:15:23,487 --> 00:15:24,788
Ah, shoot.

367
00:15:25,288 --> 00:15:28,156
When I come outta here,
my coochie gonna be so clean,

368
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:29,693
it's gonna squeak.

369
00:15:38,300 --> 00:15:40,904
I don't want her to know all that
stuff about Charlie or Bailey.

370
00:15:41,138 --> 00:15:42,405
You gotta stop.

371
00:15:43,173 --> 00:15:44,775
Hey, sorry.

372
00:15:46,176 --> 00:15:50,747
You gotta slowly tell her
things, because, um...

373
00:15:51,181 --> 00:15:52,582
she has to process them.

374
00:15:53,016 --> 00:15:54,516
She can be a little violent.

375
00:15:54,518 --> 00:15:56,383
Yeah, well, she needs
to be violent with his ass.

376
00:15:56,385 --> 00:15:57,685
[scoffs]

377
00:15:57,687 --> 00:15:59,386
Danica, he proposed to you

378
00:15:59,388 --> 00:16:01,191
and then walked off
with that girl.

379
00:16:01,591 --> 00:16:02,959
[muffled grunt]

380
00:16:03,794 --> 00:16:05,128
I'm happy.

381
00:16:05,361 --> 00:16:06,462
Hello?

382
00:16:06,797 --> 00:16:09,597
With myself and with Charlie.

383
00:16:09,599 --> 00:16:11,666
So... So, please,

384
00:16:11,668 --> 00:16:13,201
just... just stop.

385
00:16:13,203 --> 00:16:14,368
- Okay.
- Okay?

386
00:16:14,370 --> 00:16:15,604
- Okay.
- Okay.

387
00:16:16,039 --> 00:16:17,404
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

388
00:16:17,406 --> 00:16:19,375
- To happy.
- To happy.

389
00:16:21,443 --> 00:16:23,345
I don't think
it should be on the nose.

390
00:16:23,579 --> 00:16:25,115
- Yeah, I agree.
- Yeah.

391
00:16:25,548 --> 00:16:27,581
The ad should say, "The List."

392
00:16:27,583 --> 00:16:28,717
But that's on the nose.

393
00:16:28,952 --> 00:16:30,551
Kalli, that's the name
of the product.

394
00:16:30,553 --> 00:16:32,352
[both laugh]

395
00:16:32,354 --> 00:16:34,189
Girl, you know
if you nail this...

396
00:16:34,191 --> 00:16:35,691
I know, I know.

397
00:16:35,892 --> 00:16:37,961
- It's a lot of money.
- I know.

398
00:16:38,527 --> 00:16:40,327
But I can't think about it.
We need to just do it.

399
00:16:40,329 --> 00:16:42,030
- Yes.
- Okay.

Yes, which is why

407
00:16:51,841 --> 00:16:53,440
we should finish
the rest of this wine

408
00:16:53,442 --> 00:16:55,312
- before she comes out.
- Ooh! Please!

409
00:16:55,678 --> 00:16:57,578
Girl, the corner office,

410
00:16:57,580 --> 00:16:59,413
the huge bonus,

411
00:16:59,415 --> 00:17:00,783
the promotion.

412
00:17:01,117 --> 00:17:02,583
Oof!

413
00:17:02,585 --> 00:17:03,984
- [cell phone vibrates]
- And we're done.

414
00:17:03,986 --> 00:17:06,755
Your phone.
It says, "Bae."

415
00:17:07,389 --> 00:17:08,624
Is that Charlie?

416
00:17:10,327 --> 00:17:11,560
Answer it.

417
00:17:13,395 --> 00:17:15,131
- Hello?
- [Charlie] <i>Hey.</i>

418
00:17:15,698 --> 00:17:17,631
<i>Damn, I've been thinking
about you all day.</i>

419
00:17:17,633 --> 00:17:21,269
That's funny, because we've
been talking about you all day.

420
00:17:21,271 --> 00:17:23,304
<i>Oh. Uh, who is this?</i>

421
00:17:23,306 --> 00:17:24,938
It's Kalli, Danica's friend.

422
00:17:24,940 --> 00:17:27,208
<i>Yeah, she told me
a lot about you.</i>

423
00:17:27,210 --> 00:17:29,176
She lied. I'm a size six.

424
00:17:29,178 --> 00:17:30,711
[chuckling]

425
00:17:30,713 --> 00:17:32,212
And she's told me
a lot more about you.

426
00:17:32,214 --> 00:17:34,414
So... [clears throat]
when am I gonna see you?

427
00:17:34,416 --> 00:17:36,116
<i>Oh...</i> [stammering]

428
00:17:36,118 --> 00:17:38,020
[whispering]
Damn, he sounds fine!

429
00:17:39,255 --> 00:17:41,757
- Hey.
- <i>Yeah, I didn't know you had company.</i>

430
00:17:42,258 --> 00:17:45,058
- <i>You wanna talk later?</i>
- No, it's a good time to talk now.

431
00:17:45,060 --> 00:17:46,095
How was your day?

432
00:17:46,528 --> 00:17:48,362
<i>Stressful, but I'm good.</i>

433
00:17:48,364 --> 00:17:49,663
<i>What did you do today?</i>

434
00:17:49,665 --> 00:17:51,932
Well, we got the account
that I wanted.

435
00:17:51,934 --> 00:17:53,967
And we are working on it
as we speak.

436
00:17:53,969 --> 00:17:56,136
<i>Oh, wow.
That's great. Congrats.</i>

437
00:17:56,138 --> 00:17:59,139
I'm trying to be cool, but I really
want this campaign to be amazing.

438
00:17:59,141 --> 00:18:03,279
I would be the first black woman
to be a VP in the company.

439
00:18:03,612 --> 00:18:06,546
Dang, girl, I didn't know
you was getting married!

440
00:18:06,548 --> 00:18:09,316
You bought a wedding dress
and everything.

441
00:18:09,318 --> 00:18:11,885
- Baby, can I call you back?
- "Baby"? Is that Charles?

442
00:18:11,887 --> 00:18:14,021
Is that who you bought
this wedding dress for?

443
00:18:14,023 --> 00:18:15,722
- Did you buy a wedding dress for Charlie?
- I'll call you back.

444
00:18:15,724 --> 00:18:16,992
- Y'all getting married?
- Tanya!

445
00:18:19,361 --> 00:18:20,930
Why did you do that?

446
00:18:21,230 --> 00:18:22,528
I just wanted to talk to him.

447
00:18:22,530 --> 00:18:25,566
[screaming]
Take off my dress!

448
00:18:27,535 --> 00:18:29,504
[soft chuckle, sigh]

449
00:18:31,506 --> 00:18:33,106
What's wrong with you,
homegirl?

450
00:18:33,108 --> 00:18:35,309
Who you think you're
yelling at up in here?

451
00:18:35,311 --> 00:18:37,610
- Who you think... Bitch!
- Come on, I'll help you get out of that.

452
00:18:37,612 --> 00:18:39,712
Don't you know I just
got out of prison, bitch?

453
00:18:39,714 --> 00:18:41,882
Don't you know you will get
fucked up over here?

454
00:18:41,884 --> 00:18:43,549
- Okay, come.
- What do you think this is?

455
00:18:43,551 --> 00:18:45,419
- I'll help you out the dress.
- I'm fresh outta jail.

456
00:18:45,421 --> 00:18:47,753
You don't talk to nobody
fresh outta jail like that.

457
00:18:47,755 --> 00:18:49,455
- [Kalli] Come on.
- The fuck she... You think...

458
00:18:49,457 --> 00:18:51,391
You think you won't get
your ass whipped here, bitch?

459
00:18:51,393 --> 00:18:53,293
Tanya! No. No.

460
00:18:53,295 --> 00:18:55,761
- I'm just saying.
- I'm gonna help you take this off, okay?

461
00:18:55,763 --> 00:18:57,197
Do she know
who she's dealing with?

462
00:18:57,199 --> 00:18:59,232
- Come on.
- I don't give a fuck!

463
00:18:59,234 --> 00:19:01,268
- You got me working this shit.
- You will get tore up out here.

464
00:19:01,270 --> 00:19:02,735
You will get tore up!

465
00:19:02,737 --> 00:19:04,404
I don't care
if your house clean, bitch.

466
00:19:04,406 --> 00:19:05,673
It'll get dirty in a minute.

467
00:19:05,940 --> 00:19:08,810
Ooh! She lucky I didn't
punch her in her damn face.

468
00:19:09,044 --> 00:19:10,110
Hollering at me.

469
00:19:10,112 --> 00:19:10,945
I don't like that.

470
00:19:11,180 --> 00:19:12,912
You know what?
I saw <i>Bridesmaids.</i>

471
00:19:12,914 --> 00:19:14,882
I will take a shit
in this dress.

472
00:19:15,317 --> 00:19:16,515
Please don't do that.

473
00:19:16,517 --> 00:19:17,719
Look...

474
00:19:18,354 --> 00:19:19,487
I'm worried about her.

475
00:19:20,021 --> 00:19:21,656
She's selling that shit,
ain't she?

476
00:19:21,990 --> 00:19:24,291
Yeah, I knew you can't live like
this without selling that shit.

477
00:19:24,293 --> 00:19:26,761
No. No, no, no,
it's nothing like that.

478
00:19:27,396 --> 00:19:28,861
Look, Bailey broke her heart.

479
00:19:28,863 --> 00:19:30,696
She pretends
that everything is okay,

480
00:19:30,698 --> 00:19:32,265
but she had
the whole wedding planned.

481
00:19:32,267 --> 00:19:34,767
And bought this dress.
She bought it that day.

482
00:19:34,769 --> 00:19:36,736
And that night he told her
he'd met someone else.

483
00:19:36,738 --> 00:19:38,338
And then she went
into a deep depression,

484
00:19:38,340 --> 00:19:39,538
and she was so sad.

485
00:19:39,540 --> 00:19:40,906
Her work was suffering.

486
00:19:40,908 --> 00:19:42,877
Look, I'm still
really concerned.

487
00:19:43,312 --> 00:19:45,811
- Yeah, I'm gonna fuck him up.
- No. She doesn't want that.

488
00:19:45,813 --> 00:19:48,581
You don't know her, okay?
She has a mean streak

489
00:19:48,583 --> 00:19:50,549
and a hood streak,
just like me.

490
00:19:50,551 --> 00:19:52,386
We come from
the same place, all right?

491
00:19:52,388 --> 00:19:53,819
And we gonna tear his ass up.

492
00:19:53,821 --> 00:19:55,723
Your sister has changed.

493
00:19:56,157 --> 00:19:58,724
Dang. Money take the
gangster out you, huh?

494
00:19:58,726 --> 00:20:01,761
That's like Puffy walking around calling
himself "Brother Love" and shit.

495
00:20:01,763 --> 00:20:03,031
Well, you know what?

496
00:20:03,465 --> 00:20:04,864
She got Charlie now.

497
00:20:04,866 --> 00:20:06,432
He's probably the one.

498
00:20:06,434 --> 00:20:08,567
Mmm, that's another thing
I'm concerned about.

499
00:20:08,569 --> 00:20:10,403
Damn, you concerned
about a lot of shit.

500
00:20:10,405 --> 00:20:13,372
Look, all I'm saying is she
met him online a year ago,

501
00:20:13,374 --> 00:20:15,941
and she doesn't date anybody else.
She only talks to him.

502
00:20:15,943 --> 00:20:19,814
Well, that's her, you know? She into that
monogram type of relationship stuff.

503
00:20:20,181 --> 00:20:21,783
Mo... Monogamy?

504
00:20:22,050 --> 00:20:23,851
Oh, yeah, that's the word.
Yeah, "monogamy."

505
00:20:24,085 --> 00:20:25,951
- That's when just one people, right?
- Well... Yeah.

506
00:20:25,953 --> 00:20:27,987
- Just two people.
- Just the two?

507
00:20:27,989 --> 00:20:29,488
- One-to-one relationship?
- Yeah.

508
00:20:29,490 --> 00:20:31,357
Well, I'm concerned.

509
00:20:31,359 --> 00:20:35,061
They can't even Skype. He says his
computer or his camera is broken.

510
00:20:35,063 --> 00:20:36,796
And the WiFi where he is
isn't strong enough,

511
00:20:36,798 --> 00:20:39,233
'cause he works
on a offshore oil rig.

512
00:20:40,334 --> 00:20:41,803
What the hell is Skype?

513
00:20:42,602 --> 00:20:44,904
Oh, oh! Wait a minute.
I know, I know.

514
00:20:44,906 --> 00:20:46,872
That's, like, okay, you know
when I was in jail, right?

515
00:20:46,874 --> 00:20:50,176
When I was in jail we used to be in the
rec room watching TV all the time.

516
00:20:50,178 --> 00:20:52,845
And there was this one show that
used to come on all the time,

517
00:20:52,847 --> 00:20:55,114
and this what this sound like.
It's on MTV.

518
00:20:55,116 --> 00:20:57,049
It's a show
called <i>Catfish,</i> right?

519
00:20:57,051 --> 00:21:00,186
And they... If the person you
trying to talk to on the computer

520
00:21:00,188 --> 00:21:02,955
don't wanna Skype with you,
they probably not real.

521
00:21:02,957 --> 00:21:04,423
That's what's going on.

522
00:21:04,425 --> 00:21:05,723
She dating the... Ghosted.

523
00:21:05,725 --> 00:21:07,426
She got ghosted right now.

524
00:21:07,428 --> 00:21:10,563
So, what we gonna do is we
gonna contact <i>Catfish,</i> right?

525
00:21:10,565 --> 00:21:11,830
No, we contact <i>Catfish.</i>

526
00:21:11,832 --> 00:21:13,665
We gonna email them
or call them.

527
00:21:13,667 --> 00:21:14,999
Probably gotta email.

528
00:21:15,001 --> 00:21:16,634
And then we let 'em know
what's going on,

529
00:21:16,636 --> 00:21:18,304
and bam! We got him.

530
00:21:18,306 --> 00:21:19,771
- And then we get her some real dick!
- Tanya.

531
00:21:19,773 --> 00:21:21,639
Tanya, I will not be
a part of that.

532
00:21:21,641 --> 00:21:23,377
And do not
tell her I told you.

533
00:21:23,710 --> 00:21:25,213
All right,
I ain't no snitch. I got you.

534
00:21:25,779 --> 00:21:28,012
- [Charlie] <i>Hey, babe. Why are you so quiet?</i>
- I'm sorry.

535
00:21:28,014 --> 00:21:29,881
I need to explain to you
about the wedding dress.

536
00:21:29,883 --> 00:21:31,017
I know you heard it.

537
00:21:31,252 --> 00:21:32,884
I bought the dress
when I thought

538
00:21:32,886 --> 00:21:34,353
my ex and I were going
to get married.

539
00:21:34,355 --> 00:21:36,121
We didn't,
and I still have it.

540
00:21:36,123 --> 00:21:38,259
I didn't want you to think
I bought it for you.

541
00:21:38,625 --> 00:21:40,894
[Charlie] <i>Well, I wouldn't
mind if you did, baby.</i>

542
00:21:41,161 --> 00:21:42,996
<i>I mean, I do feel like
you're my soulmate.</i>

543
00:21:43,598 --> 00:21:47,932
Charlie, what if you met me and I'm
not the person you think I am?

544
00:21:47,934 --> 00:21:50,837
I mean, what if we don't have
any chemistry?

545
00:21:51,071 --> 00:21:53,004
- We're so good on the phone.
- [Charlie chuckles]

546
00:21:53,006 --> 00:21:54,440
<i>Don't be afraid of that, babe.</i>

547
00:21:54,442 --> 00:21:56,074
<i>We'll be good together.
I promise you.</i>

548
00:21:56,076 --> 00:21:57,642
I wish I could see you.

549
00:21:57,644 --> 00:21:59,744
<i>Yeah, I'm gonna put in
another request</i>

550
00:21:59,746 --> 00:22:01,413
<i>to upgrade the WiFi.</i>

551
00:22:01,415 --> 00:22:03,582
<i>But they're on this
crazy budget around here.</i>

552
00:22:03,584 --> 00:22:06,084
- I wish I was there.
- <i>I wish you were here too.</i>

553
00:22:06,086 --> 00:22:08,086
<i>Look, I gotta turn in.
Early morning.</i>

554
00:22:08,088 --> 00:22:09,921
<i>But, um, I love you.</i>

555
00:22:09,923 --> 00:22:11,256
I love you too.

556
00:22:11,258 --> 00:22:12,792
- <i>Goodnight.</i>
- Night.

557
00:22:17,397 --> 00:22:18,431
[Danica] Tanya.

558
00:22:18,965 --> 00:22:20,433
- Wake up.
- [soft snoring]

559
00:22:24,237 --> 00:22:26,673
- Come on. Get up.
- I told you I stabbed my friend up.

560
00:22:28,175 --> 00:22:30,810
[sighs]
Jail flashback. Sorry.

561
00:22:32,078 --> 00:22:33,880
I'm sorry
about your wedding dress.

562
00:22:34,114 --> 00:22:36,347
Oh, forget it.
It's going to be a great day.

563
00:22:36,349 --> 00:22:39,083
Come on. You gotta get up.
You have to find a job

564
00:22:39,085 --> 00:22:40,985
so you can be in good standing
with your probation officer,

565
00:22:40,987 --> 00:22:42,887
and then you gotta find a place
to go to your AA meetings.

566
00:22:42,889 --> 00:22:44,289
I found this address.

567
00:22:44,291 --> 00:22:45,890
I don't know
why I think I know it,

568
00:22:45,892 --> 00:22:47,060
but it's close to my job.

569
00:22:48,795 --> 00:22:52,597
I need to talk to you about this finding
a job and being clean and stuff.

570
00:22:52,599 --> 00:22:54,798
I was thinking, if I just had
a little bit of weed...

571
00:22:54,800 --> 00:22:55,969
Here, put this on.

572
00:22:56,670 --> 00:22:57,770
And we...

573
00:22:58,238 --> 00:23:00,006
We need to do something
with your hair.

574
00:23:00,674 --> 00:23:02,242
[groans]

575
00:23:02,775 --> 00:23:04,808
Would you...
Would you stand up straight?

576
00:23:04,810 --> 00:23:08,048
- You know it's been a long time since I wore heels.
- Oh, Lord.

577
00:23:08,481 --> 00:23:11,282
Let's grab a coffee real quick.
Well, not really quick.

578
00:23:11,284 --> 00:23:13,852
These heels giving me
an earthquake in my panties.

579
00:23:14,087 --> 00:23:17,854
- [Danica] Let's go.
- You know I can't do these heels like this.

580
00:23:17,856 --> 00:23:20,726
- Keep going. You'll get it.
- [woman] I want the one over there, please.

581
00:23:20,993 --> 00:23:22,527
Thank you. Come on.

582
00:23:22,529 --> 00:23:24,930
They let the disabled cut?
I'm sorry, y'all.

583
00:23:25,599 --> 00:23:26,964
Okay.

584
00:23:26,966 --> 00:23:29,032
- Hey. Good morning.
- Good morning.

585
00:23:29,034 --> 00:23:30,468
- Hey.
- Hey. How you doing?

586
00:23:30,470 --> 00:23:32,370
- This is my sister, Tanya.
- All right.

587
00:23:32,372 --> 00:23:34,138
She needs an espresso,
please.

588
00:23:34,140 --> 00:23:36,006
- I need a joint.
- I can't help you with the joint.

589
00:23:36,008 --> 00:23:37,375
I can help you
with the espresso.

590
00:23:37,377 --> 00:23:38,875
You're gonna let me
pay for this.

591
00:23:38,877 --> 00:23:40,511
I can't hear you.
What are you saying?

592
00:23:40,513 --> 00:23:42,247
Girl, you need to go ahead
and just, yeah,

593
00:23:42,249 --> 00:23:43,947
move the foam around
a little more.

594
00:23:43,949 --> 00:23:45,350
Look, your steam
not hot enough.

595
00:23:45,352 --> 00:23:47,050
Yeah, we've been
having trouble with it.

596
00:23:47,052 --> 00:23:48,653
You know what?
There's a valve on the back

597
00:23:48,655 --> 00:23:50,355
that gets stuck sometimes.

598
00:23:50,357 --> 00:23:52,425
- Really?
- If you look in the lower back part...

599
00:23:52,626 --> 00:23:54,157
I could help you with that.

600
00:23:54,159 --> 00:23:56,059
Check it out.
The lower back, it gets stuck.

601
00:23:56,061 --> 00:23:58,596
- Thank you.
- Yeah, but no. Down, lower.

602
00:23:58,598 --> 00:24:00,931
You gotta get lower, baby.
You gotta bend over, baby.

603
00:24:00,933 --> 00:24:02,533
You gotta get a little
lower. Underneath.

604
00:24:02,535 --> 00:24:05,135
Yeah, bend at the knee.
There you go.

605
00:24:05,137 --> 00:24:07,237
- Yeah! You, shut up!
- Tanya!

606
00:24:07,239 --> 00:24:08,972
Yeah, now you feeling,
you feeling it?

607
00:24:08,974 --> 00:24:10,475
- Right here?
- Yeah, right up in there.

608
00:24:10,477 --> 00:24:12,409
- And you feel something warm?
- Absolutely.

609
00:24:12,411 --> 00:24:13,944
It's a little, like, hot.
A little steamy, a little bit.

610
00:24:13,946 --> 00:24:15,145
- It is hot, yeah.
- Yeah, yeah.

611
00:24:15,147 --> 00:24:16,446
Now put your two fingers
in there.

612
00:24:16,448 --> 00:24:18,448
You gotta put
two fingers up in there.

613
00:24:18,450 --> 00:24:20,250
- I...
- And whirl it around a little bit. Bitch, move.

614
00:24:20,252 --> 00:24:22,219
I can't see him. Move...
Bitch, get out the way.

615
00:24:22,221 --> 00:24:23,954
- You should feel something warm there.
- Yeah. Okay.

616
00:24:23,956 --> 00:24:26,089
Yeah. And then move them
around a little bit.

617
00:24:26,091 --> 00:24:27,891
Yeah, move them around.

618
00:24:27,893 --> 00:24:29,259
Now slowly pull 'em out.

619
00:24:29,261 --> 00:24:30,963
You should feel
a little click.

620
00:24:31,497 --> 00:24:32,829
Go ahead and try it now.

621
00:24:32,831 --> 00:24:33,999
- [Frank] That's crazy.
- Yeah.

622
00:24:34,833 --> 00:24:36,368
- Yeah, yeah.
- That's crazy. I didn't even know.

623
00:24:36,568 --> 00:24:38,871
- [steam hissing]
- [Frank] Look at that.

624
00:24:40,806 --> 00:24:42,508
[Tanya] Whoo!

625
00:24:43,676 --> 00:24:46,378
That's something else, right?
Damn, who knew? How'd you know?

626
00:24:46,879 --> 00:24:48,514
You know, I was in...

627
00:24:49,148 --> 00:24:51,749
I was in charge of the coffee
for all the guards.

628
00:24:51,751 --> 00:24:54,518
- Okay.
- They used to call me Negress Barista.

629
00:24:54,520 --> 00:24:56,788
I got you, but guards, you said
"guards." What'd you mean?

630
00:24:56,790 --> 00:24:59,124
- Yeah. I did a bit.
- Okay.

631
00:24:59,725 --> 00:25:01,892
- How long you been out?
- [Danica] Not long.

632
00:25:01,894 --> 00:25:04,961
She's going down to the unemployment
office down the street.

633
00:25:04,963 --> 00:25:06,630
Danica, unemployment office?

634
00:25:06,632 --> 00:25:08,732
I mean, with the whole felon
thing that's gonna be hard.

635
00:25:08,734 --> 00:25:10,102
Yeah, I tried to tell her.

636
00:25:10,469 --> 00:25:12,502
- Why don't you just work here?
- For real?

637
00:25:12,504 --> 00:25:15,005
I mean...
obviously we need help.

638
00:25:15,007 --> 00:25:16,508
- [Tanya] Oh, snap.
- Isn't this great?

639
00:25:16,874 --> 00:25:17,976
Yeah, for real.

640
00:25:18,277 --> 00:25:20,346
Liliana, get this young lady
an application.

641
00:25:20,646 --> 00:25:24,281
That's what's up. Yeah, this is so dope.
I can come back there?

642
00:25:24,283 --> 00:25:25,816
- Absolutely.
- Like, right now?

643
00:25:25,818 --> 00:25:27,317
- Right now right now.
- Right now right now?

644
00:25:27,319 --> 00:25:29,188
Absolutely.
Come on, come around back.

645
00:25:30,356 --> 00:25:32,324
Feels special coming around
the back side.

646
00:25:32,825 --> 00:25:36,293
Listen, I appreciate you
trying to do this for me.

647
00:25:36,295 --> 00:25:40,364
- Absolutely, yeah.
- But my sister is a... bit much.

648
00:25:40,366 --> 00:25:41,533
No, I got it.

649
00:25:42,267 --> 00:25:44,401
- I mean, we...
- [Tanya] Where... Excuse me.

650
00:25:44,403 --> 00:25:46,638
Where it say "felon," what you
want me to put right there?

651
00:25:47,138 --> 00:25:50,273
- I'll take care of the felon part.
- That's what I'm talking about.

652
00:25:50,275 --> 00:25:52,411
All right. You gonna be a good boss.
I can tell.

653
00:25:52,611 --> 00:25:56,178
- I can't be responsible for her actions.
- Really, Danica, I got it.

654
00:25:56,180 --> 00:25:57,781
- How hard could it be?
- You should...

655
00:25:57,783 --> 00:25:59,048
Where it say "sex,"

656
00:25:59,050 --> 00:26:00,419
what you want me
to put right there?

657
00:26:00,918 --> 00:26:02,319
Uh...

658
00:26:02,321 --> 00:26:04,153
- Female, right?
- What you wanna put?

659
00:26:04,155 --> 00:26:05,858
Plenty. [chuckles]

660
00:26:06,224 --> 00:26:07,626
Just so you know.

661
00:26:09,160 --> 00:26:10,396
- Plenty.
- See?

662
00:26:11,195 --> 00:26:12,230
You said you got it.

663
00:26:12,664 --> 00:26:14,533
- You got it.
- I did say that, didn't I?

664
00:26:15,233 --> 00:26:17,366
Um, excuse me.
Where it say "position,"

665
00:26:17,368 --> 00:26:18,936
which one
do you want me to be in?

666
00:26:19,471 --> 00:26:20,970
What position you wanna be in?

667
00:26:20,972 --> 00:26:23,840
Well, you know,
I prefer doggy style.

668
00:26:23,842 --> 00:26:25,341
But you seem more
like a missionary.

669
00:26:25,343 --> 00:26:27,778
But you know what?
I could show you the spider.

670
00:26:27,780 --> 00:26:30,279
You heard about the spider? You ain't did
the spider? You know nothing about that.

671
00:26:30,281 --> 00:26:32,083
Just legs everywhere.

672
00:26:32,785 --> 00:26:34,116
Just legs. Just, whoo!

673
00:26:34,118 --> 00:26:35,985
You know
I got some legs on me, so...

674
00:26:35,987 --> 00:26:37,756
Wait, I'm gonna show you
that spider, boy.

675
00:26:38,824 --> 00:26:42,625
Uh... for references,
who do you want me to put down?

676
00:26:42,627 --> 00:26:44,761
- Me.
- [Tanya] Nah, I ain't never slept with you.

677
00:26:44,763 --> 00:26:46,765
You know what? I'm gonna go
ahead and put Malik down.

678
00:26:47,064 --> 00:26:48,299
Yeah.

679
00:26:49,100 --> 00:26:50,869
Okay. Thank you.

680
00:26:51,335 --> 00:26:52,935
Tanya, call me later.

681
00:26:52,937 --> 00:26:55,440
Yeah, girl, I'm gonna call
you as soon as I get off.

682
00:26:56,240 --> 00:26:57,708
Yeah, this should be fun.

683
00:27:00,278 --> 00:27:01,612
Okay, what do you smell?

684
00:27:04,015 --> 00:27:05,716
- Jasmine.
- What else?

685
00:27:06,083 --> 00:27:08,119
- Lilac?
- Hillary?

686
00:27:08,619 --> 00:27:11,622
Yeah, I'm on a strict
no smelling diet this week.

687
00:27:11,856 --> 00:27:12,925
Lost four pounds.

688
00:27:13,391 --> 00:27:15,691
- Amazing, congrats.
- Okay, I came up with something.

689
00:27:15,693 --> 00:27:17,094
Okay, you ready?

690
00:27:19,030 --> 00:27:20,264
"The List.

691
00:27:20,865 --> 00:27:22,099
Are you on it?"

692
00:27:23,734 --> 00:27:25,000
Sounds scary.

693
00:27:25,002 --> 00:27:26,001
- Right?
- Yeah. I like that.

694
00:27:26,003 --> 00:27:27,470
Scary's good, right?

695
00:27:27,472 --> 00:27:29,171
Yeah, it's like
<i>Schindler's List.</i>

696
00:27:29,173 --> 00:27:30,639
- But that was a good list.
- Yes.

697
00:27:30,641 --> 00:27:32,441
Yes, 'cause he saved
a lot of people.

698
00:27:32,443 --> 00:27:35,177
Okay, I'm just gonna say
I think this is stupid.

699
00:27:35,179 --> 00:27:37,915
Okay? Who makes
a wish list for a man?

700
00:27:38,182 --> 00:27:41,550
Look, I don't know. I'm just having a
whole issue with the whole thing, okay?

701
00:27:41,552 --> 00:27:44,255
I like other lists.
Angie's. Craig's.

702
00:27:44,589 --> 00:27:46,856
I just think most lists
have been dominated.

703
00:27:46,858 --> 00:27:48,124
Listen, how about this?

704
00:27:48,426 --> 00:27:50,759
We're not here
to judge the product.

705
00:27:50,761 --> 00:27:51,929
- Right.
- Okay?

706
00:27:52,230 --> 00:27:54,499
We're here to just
brand it and sell it.

707
00:27:54,966 --> 00:27:59,033
- Brand it and sell it.
- Yeah. Bring back some ideas.

708
00:27:59,035 --> 00:28:00,438
Because we're running
out of time.

709
00:28:00,738 --> 00:28:02,203
- Yeah, okay.
- You got it. Yeah, we can do that.

710
00:28:02,205 --> 00:28:03,574
- Thank you.
- Okay.

711
00:28:05,242 --> 00:28:07,242
- [Frank] Son, your mama's here.
- Okay.

712
00:28:07,244 --> 00:28:10,080
Pack your things up. Make sure you
behave for your mama, all right?

713
00:28:10,581 --> 00:28:12,180
And I'll be
at your game tomorrow.

714
00:28:12,182 --> 00:28:13,782
- Okay.
- Okay. I love you.

715
00:28:13,784 --> 00:28:15,149
[boy] Love you too.
See you there.

716
00:28:15,151 --> 00:28:16,319
- [Frank] Bye.
- Bye.

717
00:28:19,022 --> 00:28:20,257
That's your kid?

718
00:28:20,958 --> 00:28:23,592
- Yeah.
- He is so cute.

719
00:28:23,594 --> 00:28:25,328
- Thank you.
- You a good dude.

720
00:28:25,596 --> 00:28:28,031
- Thanks, Tanya.
- You want some? Can I get you some?

721
00:28:28,799 --> 00:28:29,865
Get me some what?

722
00:28:29,867 --> 00:28:31,700
I mean... Never mind.

723
00:28:31,702 --> 00:28:32,937
Unless you want it.

724
00:28:33,403 --> 00:28:35,370
But I just wanna show
my appreciation

725
00:28:35,372 --> 00:28:36,672
for you giving me this job.

726
00:28:36,674 --> 00:28:38,273
I appreciate that
you're appreciative.

727
00:28:38,275 --> 00:28:40,275
Man, when I tell my PO

728
00:28:40,277 --> 00:28:43,012
that I got a job,
he is gonna be so shocked.

729
00:28:43,014 --> 00:28:45,248
I thought I was gonna have to
sleep with him or something.

730
00:28:45,515 --> 00:28:48,383
Anyways, all I gotta do
is AA meetings once a week,

731
00:28:48,385 --> 00:28:51,820
and it's gonna be breezy, 'cause my
sister gave me this address right here.

732
00:28:51,822 --> 00:28:53,956
- Do you know where this is at?
- Do I know where it's at?

733
00:28:53,958 --> 00:28:55,991
- It's here. Yeah.
- This is here?

734
00:28:55,993 --> 00:28:57,960
Oh, my...
I am so damn lucky.

735
00:28:57,962 --> 00:28:59,694
- Why are you so lucky?
- I need to play the lotto or something.

736
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:01,696
Maybe you should.
You know what?

737
00:29:01,698 --> 00:29:03,366
You could help me set up
later, for the AA meeting.

738
00:29:03,801 --> 00:29:06,134
- Cool.
- I wanna ask you something.

739
00:29:06,136 --> 00:29:07,337
You and your sister close?

740
00:29:07,671 --> 00:29:10,106
- Y'all seem close, I mean.
- Yeah, we...

741
00:29:10,807 --> 00:29:12,807
We've been close
ever since we was little kids.

742
00:29:12,809 --> 00:29:14,776
You know,
she was always the smart one.

743
00:29:14,778 --> 00:29:16,511
I was the one
always getting in trouble.

744
00:29:16,513 --> 00:29:18,648
I know you gave me this job
because of her.

745
00:29:18,950 --> 00:29:20,381
Thank you. I appreciate it.

746
00:29:20,383 --> 00:29:21,718
Let me tell you something.

747
00:29:22,419 --> 00:29:26,387
- She got you in the door, but you got the job.
- Mmm.

748
00:29:26,389 --> 00:29:30,160
Don't be flirting with me unless you want
both of us, 'cause I know you like her.

749
00:29:30,827 --> 00:29:32,495
I do. I like her a lot.

750
00:29:32,796 --> 00:29:35,330
I tried to ask... Well,
actually, I did ask her out.

751
00:29:35,332 --> 00:29:37,131
What happened?

752
00:29:37,133 --> 00:29:40,134
She's always saying something
about Charlie, her boyfriend.

753
00:29:40,136 --> 00:29:41,605
You know this guy, Charlie?

754
00:29:43,640 --> 00:29:44,674
Yeah.

755
00:29:46,176 --> 00:29:47,410
Could you do me a favor?

756
00:29:47,911 --> 00:29:50,647
- Anything.
- Can I send an email on your computer?

757
00:29:50,880 --> 00:29:52,480
Yeah. But don't make that
a habit, Tanya.

758
00:29:52,482 --> 00:29:55,352
- I won't, I promise you I won't.
- All right.

759
00:29:56,386 --> 00:29:57,854
And let me give you some advice.

760
00:29:58,321 --> 00:30:01,224
You need to push up a little bit
harder on my sister if you want her.

761
00:30:01,558 --> 00:30:06,062
And, as soon as I finish sending this
email, all right, I'm gonna take my break.

762
00:30:06,563 --> 00:30:08,062
You ain't even worked
half a day, Tanya.

763
00:30:08,064 --> 00:30:10,098
Yeah, well, that's just
how it's gonna have to be.

764
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:12,634
- Also, I'ma need a three week vacation...
- It comes off...

765
00:30:12,636 --> 00:30:14,636
...once I finish
my first month, all right?

766
00:30:14,638 --> 00:30:18,408
I'm gonna give you the best 30 days
you ever had from an employee.

767
00:30:18,842 --> 00:30:22,378
Now we're gonna need
to talk about my 41-OK too.

768
00:30:23,145 --> 00:30:25,815
Yeah. I'm on this.

769
00:30:26,215 --> 00:30:29,819
Okay. Dear Nevvy and Max...

770
00:30:34,024 --> 00:30:35,625
Okay, Danica, think.

771
00:30:36,158 --> 00:30:38,160
[cell phone ringing]

772
00:30:39,763 --> 00:30:40,664
No.

773
00:30:41,998 --> 00:30:43,133
- Hi.
- [Charlie] <i>Hey.</i>

774
00:30:43,499 --> 00:30:44,734
<i>Can you see me?</i>

775
00:30:45,200 --> 00:30:47,035
No. It says, "poor connection."

776
00:30:47,037 --> 00:30:49,469
[groans] <i>Damn. I was hoping
this would work.</i>

777
00:30:49,471 --> 00:30:53,007
<i>I'm sorry. I wanted you to see the rig.
There's a beautiful sunset.</i>

778
00:30:53,009 --> 00:30:54,241
I wish I could see it.

779
00:30:54,243 --> 00:30:55,442
<i>I wish I could see you too.</i>

780
00:30:55,444 --> 00:30:56,880
<i>I... Where are you?</i>

781
00:30:57,312 --> 00:30:59,781
- I'm still at work.
- <i>Oh, baby.</i>

782
00:30:59,783 --> 00:31:01,951
<i>Go home and get some rest.
You sound tired.</i>

783
00:31:03,053 --> 00:31:04,520
Yeah. Maybe you're right.

784
00:31:05,587 --> 00:31:09,491
<i>You know, if I was there I would have
a bath and dinner ready for you.</i>

785
00:31:09,758 --> 00:31:10,794
You would?

786
00:31:11,161 --> 00:31:12,194
<i>Yeah.</i>

787
00:31:12,628 --> 00:31:14,064
<i>And I'd rub your feet, and...</i>

788
00:31:14,463 --> 00:31:18,233
Don't say what else you would do.
I can't handle it. I'm so horny.

789
00:31:18,701 --> 00:31:20,836
<i>Oh, okay.</i> [chuckles]

790
00:31:21,437 --> 00:31:23,470
<i>Well, I guess
I won't say it then.</i>

791
00:31:23,472 --> 00:31:25,207
Can I call you when I get home?

792
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:26,675
<i>Yeah.</i>

793
00:31:27,376 --> 00:31:28,978
- <i>I love you.</i>
- I love you too.

794
00:31:34,416 --> 00:31:35,651
Excuse me.

795
00:31:35,985 --> 00:31:37,219
What's going on here?

796
00:31:37,953 --> 00:31:39,221
It's an AA meeting.

797
00:31:44,493 --> 00:31:46,628
Guys, I was getting high
for years.

798
00:31:46,962 --> 00:31:50,831
And I was smoking,
I was drinking. I went to jail.

799
00:31:50,833 --> 00:31:53,102
And I turned it around.
I mean, now I...

800
00:31:53,769 --> 00:31:55,971
own the coffee shop, right?

801
00:31:56,538 --> 00:31:59,873
So, it's the same thing.
We cannot let the shame stop us.

802
00:31:59,875 --> 00:32:02,544
All right? But, before
we get more into that,

803
00:32:03,178 --> 00:32:04,214
group,

804
00:32:04,813 --> 00:32:06,980
this lovely lady to my right,
this is Tanya.

805
00:32:06,982 --> 00:32:09,816
- Tanya, this is the group.
- [group] Hi Tanya.

806
00:32:09,818 --> 00:32:11,118
Hey, y'all.

807
00:32:11,120 --> 00:32:14,623
Um, I haven't hit the pipe
in five years.

808
00:32:14,857 --> 00:32:16,158
I haven't, uh...

809
00:32:16,792 --> 00:32:18,458
I haven't drank
in eight months.

810
00:32:18,460 --> 00:32:20,360
And I haven't smoked
any weed or anything

811
00:32:20,362 --> 00:32:21,797
in, like, four days.

812
00:32:22,030 --> 00:32:24,798
And my whole thing is, like,
why can't I get a chip

813
00:32:24,800 --> 00:32:26,733
for everything
that I don't do.

814
00:32:26,735 --> 00:32:29,002
You know what I'm saying? Don't
hit the pipe, that's a chip.

815
00:32:29,004 --> 00:32:31,438
Don't smoke no weed
for four days. That's a chip.

816
00:32:31,440 --> 00:32:32,873
Don't drink. That's a chip.

817
00:32:32,875 --> 00:32:35,142
No D. I ain't had no D
in a whole day.

818
00:32:35,144 --> 00:32:38,211
That's a chip. I should have a
chip for every single thing.

819
00:32:38,213 --> 00:32:39,882
That's all I'm saying, man.

820
00:32:50,291 --> 00:32:51,892
[door opens]

821
00:32:51,894 --> 00:32:53,927
- Hey, you here?
- Hey, sis.

822
00:32:53,929 --> 00:32:56,529
I was just wrapping up work.
Do you want a ride?

823
00:32:56,531 --> 00:32:58,667
- Yeah. Let me go get my stuff.
- Okay.

824
00:32:59,868 --> 00:33:00,903
I missed you.

825
00:33:05,373 --> 00:33:07,608
[Tanya]
Frank, Danica's outside.

826
00:33:11,213 --> 00:33:13,182
- Hey.
- Hey.

827
00:33:13,481 --> 00:33:15,017
Your sister, she's, uh...

828
00:33:15,683 --> 00:33:17,552
She's a special one.
I really like her.

829
00:33:18,120 --> 00:33:19,654
How long were you in jail?

830
00:33:20,321 --> 00:33:21,689
I didn't know that.

831
00:33:21,924 --> 00:33:24,826
Uh, I didn't know
you'd heard that. Seven years.

832
00:33:25,260 --> 00:33:26,494
It was a long time ago.

833
00:33:27,996 --> 00:33:28,997
All right, yeah.

834
00:33:30,032 --> 00:33:32,633
- Yeah.
- Tell Tanya I'll be in the car.

835
00:33:34,303 --> 00:33:36,437
All righty. You got it.

836
00:33:46,814 --> 00:33:50,716
I didn't know that he was in
recovery and that he's been in jail.

837
00:33:50,718 --> 00:33:52,551
Yeah, but he's still
a cool-ass nigga.

838
00:33:52,553 --> 00:33:54,787
[sighs]
Damn. I mean, Tanya,

839
00:33:54,789 --> 00:33:56,789
has every black man
been to jail?

840
00:33:56,791 --> 00:33:59,226
Yeah, girl. Anyone
that is worth fucking with

841
00:33:59,228 --> 00:34:00,826
has been to jail at least once.

842
00:34:00,828 --> 00:34:03,397
That's what make 'em a man.
You know he like you.

843
00:34:03,831 --> 00:34:06,500
- Yeah. That will never happen.
- What?

844
00:34:07,768 --> 00:34:09,937
- Oh, 'cause of Charlie.
- Mm-hmm.

845
00:34:10,438 --> 00:34:11,672
That's right.

846
00:34:13,074 --> 00:34:14,609
Yeah, I got you, girl.

847
00:34:15,109 --> 00:34:16,143
I got you.

848
00:34:18,347 --> 00:34:20,946
[Nev] All right, "Help! I think
my sister's being catfished."

849
00:34:20,948 --> 00:34:22,648
- All right, we got it.
- Catfish, go.

850
00:34:22,650 --> 00:34:24,717
All right, here we go.
This one's from Tanya.

851
00:34:24,719 --> 00:34:27,686
- Okay. Tanya.
- Tanya says, "Dear Nev and Max,

852
00:34:27,688 --> 00:34:30,890
my sister's been dating this man
for a year online. Never...

853
00:34:30,892 --> 00:34:32,860
- [Max] A year?
- A year. "And she's never met him."

854
00:34:33,060 --> 00:34:34,627
- A year is...
- Wait, wait.

855
00:34:34,629 --> 00:34:35,928
We're talking about
twelve months.

856
00:34:35,930 --> 00:34:37,830
He says he's on
an offshore oil rig.

857
00:34:37,832 --> 00:34:39,598
Oh, please.
We've actually never...

858
00:34:39,600 --> 00:34:41,033
- I've never heard that before.
- That's new.

859
00:34:41,035 --> 00:34:42,468
- That's pretty good.
- That's a new one.

860
00:34:42,470 --> 00:34:43,903
And he's on a... Let me guess.

861
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,271
He's on an oil rig,
so he can't talk.

862
00:34:45,273 --> 00:34:46,972
Now, anyway, she's in love.

863
00:34:46,974 --> 00:34:48,841
- And has even bought a wedding dress.
- Oh, God.

864
00:34:48,843 --> 00:34:50,475
- She's invested money.
- Wow.

865
00:34:50,477 --> 00:34:52,443
- She's planned the entire wedding.
- Oh, God.

866
00:34:52,445 --> 00:34:54,479
Wow. "Please help.
Thanks, Tanya."

867
00:34:54,481 --> 00:34:55,848
All right.
Well, let's call Tanya

868
00:34:55,850 --> 00:34:57,852
and see what, uh,
see what she has to say.

869
00:34:58,786 --> 00:35:00,252
[telephone ringing]

870
00:35:00,254 --> 00:35:02,757
- Let me get a bite.
- You get the phone.

871
00:35:04,158 --> 00:35:05,760

872
00:35:06,193 --> 00:35:07,525
Brown Bean Coffee Shop.

873
00:35:07,527 --> 00:35:10,162
Hi, this is Nev
and Max from <i>Catfish.</i>

874
00:35:10,164 --> 00:35:11,596
We're looking for Tanya.

875
00:35:11,598 --> 00:35:14,733
No way!
I'm the one that called y'all.

876
00:35:14,735 --> 00:35:16,467
<i>I'm so excited. Y'all so fine.</i>

877
00:35:16,469 --> 00:35:18,636
So, Tanya, you think
your sister's being catfished?

878
00:35:18,638 --> 00:35:20,707
I do. Yes, I do.

879
00:35:21,108 --> 00:35:23,943
[Nev] <i>Yeah. I mean, from your email
it definitely sounds like it.</i>

880
00:35:23,945 --> 00:35:26,213
And we wanna help.
I mean, this whole situation...

881
00:35:26,513 --> 00:35:29,048
- sounds a little slippery.
- It sounds like she needs our help.

882
00:35:29,050 --> 00:35:30,983
<i>Yeah. If we got there
later today,</i>

883
00:35:30,985 --> 00:35:32,717
<i>could we meet up
and find out more?</i>

884
00:35:32,719 --> 00:35:34,619
Yes. Come on to that address.

885
00:35:34,621 --> 00:35:35,957
[laughs]

886
00:35:40,361 --> 00:35:42,762
- I need real coffee.
- Why didn't you get it?

887
00:35:43,197 --> 00:35:46,497
I just dropped Tanya off. And I'm
kind of over flirting with him.

888
00:35:46,499 --> 00:35:47,801
Did you know he was a felon?

889
00:35:48,235 --> 00:35:50,535
Armed robbery.
And he's also in recovery.

890
00:35:50,537 --> 00:35:54,373
- What?
- Yeah. So, the flirting thing is done.

891
00:35:54,375 --> 00:35:56,310
I mean,
he may not be too stable.

892
00:35:56,876 --> 00:35:58,878
So, I mean,
I thought he was cute.

893
00:35:59,113 --> 00:36:02,350
But last night I realized
I need to stay away from him.

894
00:36:02,649 --> 00:36:05,286
- You're overexaggerating.
- No, I'm not.

895
00:36:05,585 --> 00:36:09,223
Come on. Let's go get coffee
together and discuss.

896
00:36:09,489 --> 00:36:10,924
- [Tanya] Up.
- [Frank] Okay.

897
00:36:12,259 --> 00:36:13,994
Hey, look who's here.

898
00:36:15,161 --> 00:36:17,764
- Kalli. Good to see your face.
- Hey.

899
00:36:19,065 --> 00:36:21,568
- Danica, good morning.
- Here you go.

900
00:36:22,202 --> 00:36:24,204
Your money's no good here.
You know that, Danica.

901
00:36:24,604 --> 00:36:25,839
Take the money.

902
00:36:26,139 --> 00:36:27,240
Please take it.

903
00:36:28,208 --> 00:36:29,242
Okay.

904
00:36:32,346 --> 00:36:34,080
Danica, hi.

905
00:36:35,416 --> 00:36:36,547
Hi.

906
00:36:36,549 --> 00:36:37,917
You remember Amanda, right?

907
00:36:38,184 --> 00:36:39,085
Hi.

908
00:36:40,053 --> 00:36:42,155
- Hi. [chuckles]
- Um...

909
00:36:43,457 --> 00:36:45,025
Will I be seeing you gals
at the wedding?

910
00:36:45,392 --> 00:36:47,759
Yeah, you sure will be seeing us there.
What's up?

911
00:36:47,761 --> 00:36:49,727
- Tanya, you're out.
- What up?

912
00:36:49,729 --> 00:36:52,932
Yup, and probably about to be
going back real soon. Who's that?

913
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:54,567
This is my fiancée.

914
00:36:54,868 --> 00:36:56,567
That's the girl
you left my sister for?

915
00:36:56,569 --> 00:36:58,171
- Oh, hell no.
- Oh, no. Tanya!

916
00:36:58,671 --> 00:37:00,438
- Hey, hey.
- What?

917
00:37:00,440 --> 00:37:02,006
- I just wanna...
- No.

918
00:37:02,008 --> 00:37:03,775
[Bailey] It's... Listen,
it's not even like that.

919
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:06,346
Timing was off, and we weren't
right for each other.

920
00:37:06,846 --> 00:37:08,081
Right, Danica?

921
00:37:09,883 --> 00:37:11,851
- No.
- Let me hear you say that, Danica.

922
00:37:12,419 --> 00:37:15,753
No. No. We weren't.
We weren't right.

923
00:37:15,755 --> 00:37:18,124
And she's happy for me, right?

924
00:37:19,159 --> 00:37:20,060
Yes.

925
00:37:20,726 --> 00:37:21,693
Mm-hmm. Yes.

926
00:37:21,995 --> 00:37:23,562
I am... I am happy.

927
00:37:23,897 --> 00:37:24,996
[Frank] Hey, my man,

928
00:37:24,998 --> 00:37:26,800
uh, what can I get for you?

929
00:37:27,467 --> 00:37:30,734
I'll have a latte and...

930
00:37:30,736 --> 00:37:32,906
- Expresso.
- Coming up.

931
00:37:33,572 --> 00:37:35,039
- I got that.
- No.

932
00:37:35,041 --> 00:37:36,874
I'm gonna help you.
I'm gonna get that.

933
00:37:36,876 --> 00:37:38,376
- Tanya, I got it.
- I got it. No, fuck this bitch.

934
00:37:38,378 --> 00:37:40,344
- Tanya, I got it, don't worry.
- No, I got...

935
00:37:40,346 --> 00:37:42,113
Get your hands off this machine.
Get your hands off the machine.

936
00:37:42,115 --> 00:37:44,015
That bastard
hurt my sister hard, okay?

937
00:37:44,017 --> 00:37:45,349
So I have to do
what I got to do.

938
00:37:45,351 --> 00:37:46,683
I'm gonna kill
this motherfucker.

939
00:37:46,685 --> 00:37:48,186
But, Tanya, you on probation.

940
00:37:48,188 --> 00:37:50,321
I'ma make this motherfucker
a mocha latte.

941
00:37:50,323 --> 00:37:51,688
- Okay.
- Okay?

942
00:37:51,690 --> 00:37:53,424
You all upset.
You're not making it right.

943
00:37:53,426 --> 00:37:54,858
What? I'm just saying.

944
00:37:54,860 --> 00:37:56,527
I'ma kill him.
I'ma just kill him...

945
00:37:56,529 --> 00:37:58,229
First I'm gonna
kill that ho, right?

946
00:37:58,231 --> 00:38:01,265
First I'm gonna kill that ho,
then I'm gonna kill him.

947
00:38:01,267 --> 00:38:03,434
But your sister seem to be okay
with the whole thing.

948
00:38:03,436 --> 00:38:06,471
No, she is very mad. Trust
me, she's mad as hell, okay?

949
00:38:06,473 --> 00:38:09,240
She out here dating a ghost,
and he come up here with her?

950
00:38:09,242 --> 00:38:11,108
- Dating a ghost?
- Yeah, she dating some dude online

951
00:38:11,110 --> 00:38:12,943
she ain't never even met.
All right?

952
00:38:12,945 --> 00:38:14,947
Fuck it. I need a break.

953
00:38:15,248 --> 00:38:16,282
Damn!

954
00:38:17,550 --> 00:38:18,949
[Nev]
So, this is all you have?

955
00:38:18,951 --> 00:38:21,019
Yeah. I found this
phone number on her desk.

956
00:38:21,321 --> 00:38:24,923
All right, well, let's do a reverse
phone search and see if we get a match.

957
00:38:25,558 --> 00:38:29,161
- All right, let's see.
- You are so fine, you know that?

958
00:38:30,028 --> 00:38:33,063
- Thanks.
- Yeah. [chuckles]

959
00:38:33,065 --> 00:38:35,500
Okay, wait, Tanya, I do need a
little space, though, so just...

960
00:38:35,502 --> 00:38:37,502
- My bad, I'm just saying.
- Let me do my thing.

961
00:38:37,504 --> 00:38:39,102
You're just so beefy.

962
00:38:39,104 --> 00:38:41,472
I mean, we would have
some cute babies together.

963
00:38:41,474 --> 00:38:43,373
They would be swirl
and everything.

964
00:38:43,375 --> 00:38:47,077
Uh, I actually already have
a baby with my wife.

965
00:38:47,079 --> 00:38:48,380
- Oh, wow.
- So, thank you.

966
00:38:48,581 --> 00:38:50,247
Well, you know what? It's cool.

967
00:38:50,249 --> 00:38:52,015
'Cause I won't tell her
or the baby,

968
00:38:52,017 --> 00:38:53,683
'cause I know
how to keep a secret, boo.

969
00:38:53,685 --> 00:38:56,186
I've done time.
[chuckling]

970
00:38:56,188 --> 00:39:00,657
Uh, well, I'm just gonna
have to say, a hard pass.

971
00:39:00,659 --> 00:39:02,094
But thank you.

972
00:39:02,761 --> 00:39:05,598
Okay, you stuck up.
He's stuck up.

973
00:39:05,898 --> 00:39:09,401
Max, how about you?
You take me to the maximum?

974
00:39:10,502 --> 00:39:14,940
- Is this happening?
- Yes! Yes, I love your grey hair.

975
00:39:15,274 --> 00:39:18,577
It's what I need in my life.
You know what I'm saying?

976
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:22,646
Like that young and old
all at the same time.

977
00:39:22,648 --> 00:39:24,181
Mmm! [muffled chuckle]

978
00:39:24,183 --> 00:39:26,816
It'd be like fucking
a young old polar bear.

979
00:39:26,818 --> 00:39:28,684
Be cold and hot.

980
00:39:28,686 --> 00:39:30,889
And I know polar bears
love fish.

981
00:39:32,124 --> 00:39:34,026
We're here
to help your sister.

982
00:39:34,259 --> 00:39:35,093
Yeah.

983
00:39:35,494 --> 00:39:37,994
Okay.
Well, if y'all do a good job

984
00:39:37,996 --> 00:39:39,164
I'll give you some.

985
00:39:39,498 --> 00:39:41,832
It's good, too.
It's that vintage.

986
00:39:42,634 --> 00:39:44,167
- You know what?
- Well, look.

987
00:39:44,169 --> 00:39:46,871
Why don't we just get back
to helping Danica, okay?

988
00:39:47,406 --> 00:39:49,541
And she knows
we're doing this, right?

989
00:39:49,840 --> 00:39:51,174
Yeah. Mmm-hmm.

990
00:39:51,176 --> 00:39:53,876
That's... Yeah.
She wanna know the truth.

991
00:39:53,878 --> 00:39:57,149
All right, here we go. I think we're
about to get... It's coming through.

992
00:39:59,084 --> 00:40:00,517
- Searching.
- [sniffs]

993
00:40:00,519 --> 00:40:02,118
- You do smell good.
- [computer beeps]

994
00:40:02,120 --> 00:40:03,852
- Oh! That's...
- Oh, my God.

995
00:40:03,854 --> 00:40:07,157
- ...definitely not the guy in the picture.
- Whoa!

996
00:40:07,159 --> 00:40:09,058
I'll get it done tonight,
put the final touches on it

997
00:40:09,060 --> 00:40:10,759
and hope that they like it.

998
00:40:10,761 --> 00:40:13,498
- Well, it's not knocking my socks off.
- I know.

999
00:40:13,764 --> 00:40:16,934
Get your things. We'll finish
it over wine at my place.

1000
00:40:17,902 --> 00:40:19,304
- Okay.
- Okay.

1001
00:40:19,837 --> 00:40:21,739

1002
00:40:24,509 --> 00:40:27,076
- Hi.
- [Charlie] <i>Hey, love. Good news,</i>

1003
00:40:27,078 --> 00:40:29,479
- <i>I can video chat.</i>
- Wait, you got better Wi-Fi?

1004
00:40:29,481 --> 00:40:32,216
<i>Well, I'm borrowing a booster
from one of the guys.</i>

1005
00:40:32,517 --> 00:40:35,485
<i>He'll be in at 8:30
and he'll let me use it then.</i>

1006
00:40:35,487 --> 00:40:37,820
- <i>I'll call you.</i>
- Okay. Well, I'll be home by then.

1007
00:40:37,822 --> 00:40:41,859
<i>Great. Yeah, I can't wait
to see your face. I love you.</i>

1008
00:40:42,059 --> 00:40:44,328
I love you, too.
[chuckles]

1009
00:40:45,597 --> 00:40:46,764
[door opens]

1010
00:40:47,566 --> 00:40:49,534
Yeah. So, that was...

1011
00:40:50,768 --> 00:40:53,472
Uh...
[clears throat]

1012
00:40:56,541 --> 00:40:57,773
Hi.

1013
00:40:57,775 --> 00:41:00,579
Um, I'm Kalli
and this is Danica.

1014
00:41:00,945 --> 00:41:02,411
So, who... What...-

1015
00:41:02,413 --> 00:41:03,812
- Hi.
- Can you please stop filming?

1016
00:41:03,814 --> 00:41:04,882
- Hi. Sorry.
- Thank you.

1017
00:41:05,149 --> 00:41:06,215
- Nev, nice to meet you.
- Hi.

1018
00:41:06,217 --> 00:41:07,684
- Hi. And I'm Max.
- Yeah.

1019
00:41:07,686 --> 00:41:08,620
- Hi.
- How are you?

1020
00:41:08,819 --> 00:41:10,886
Are you friends of Tanya?

1021
00:41:10,888 --> 00:41:12,321
- Yeah. Yes.
- [Tanya] Yes!

1022
00:41:12,323 --> 00:41:15,190
This is Nev and Max,
my new baby daddy,

1023
00:41:15,192 --> 00:41:17,359
and they do a show
called <i>Catfished.</i>

1024
00:41:17,361 --> 00:41:21,098
Yes, where they find out if
people are real on the internet.

1025
00:41:22,199 --> 00:41:24,099
- Tanya?
- What? Look. Okay?

1026
00:41:24,101 --> 00:41:25,503
Just look, all right?

1027
00:41:25,737 --> 00:41:27,403
- This is the dude that they think...
- What?

1028
00:41:27,405 --> 00:41:29,238
...is using
some other dude's pictures...

1029
00:41:29,240 --> 00:41:30,806
and just look at him!

1030
00:41:30,808 --> 00:41:32,441
That is not Charlie.

1031
00:41:32,443 --> 00:41:34,443
This dude is married,
his name is Lawrence

1032
00:41:34,445 --> 00:41:37,379
and he lives an hour and a half
away from here in a trailer park.

1033
00:41:37,381 --> 00:41:39,450
Okay.
That... That is not true.

1034
00:41:39,650 --> 00:41:42,186
Actually, we're pretty sure
that it is true.

1035
00:41:42,553 --> 00:41:43,754
And how do you know that?

1036
00:41:43,988 --> 00:41:45,554
Well, this is what we do
and it's...

1037
00:41:45,556 --> 00:41:47,256
Although the profile
is only a year old

1038
00:41:47,258 --> 00:41:48,891
and he doesn't have
that many friends.

1039
00:41:48,893 --> 00:41:50,125
He told me he doesn't have
that many friends,

1040
00:41:50,127 --> 00:41:51,894
so what does that prove?

1041
00:41:51,896 --> 00:41:54,898
Look, Danica, I know
this isn't easy for you.

1042
00:41:55,466 --> 00:41:58,534
- This can be embarrassing.
- I'm not embarrassed.

1043
00:41:58,536 --> 00:42:00,805
It's not embarrassing at all.
I mean, he...

1044
00:42:01,505 --> 00:42:04,775
We're pretty sure that the guy
you're talking to isn't real.

1045
00:42:05,142 --> 00:42:06,809
- Not real.
- I know he's real.

1046
00:42:06,811 --> 00:42:10,281
- I've talked to him.
- But have you ever seen him?

1047
00:42:10,947 --> 00:42:12,183
Yes.

1048
00:42:13,016 --> 00:42:15,417
No. No. But, I mean...

1049
00:42:15,419 --> 00:42:18,456
- FaceTime? Video chat? Anything? Snapchat?
- Skype?

1050
00:42:20,491 --> 00:42:22,560
Enough, okay?
Everybody, enough.

1051
00:42:22,859 --> 00:42:26,662
He's gonna call me at 8:30.
What is that, what, 16 minutes?

1052
00:42:26,664 --> 00:42:28,265
And we can all see him.

1053
00:42:28,532 --> 00:42:31,302
- If he's real.
- Oh, he's real, Max.

1054
00:42:31,702 --> 00:42:33,101
He's real. [scoffs]

1055
00:42:33,103 --> 00:42:34,902
And I'm right. Okay?

1056
00:42:34,904 --> 00:42:37,308
So, everybody,
have a seat! Please.

1057
00:42:38,376 --> 00:42:40,009
- Thank you.
- [Nev] Okay.

1058
00:42:40,811 --> 00:42:42,346
[Danica groans]

1059
00:42:52,021 --> 00:42:55,058
I'll just get up. Sorry.
Just gonna go this way.

1060
00:42:56,159 --> 00:42:57,994
Dang, it's like that, Max?

1061
00:42:58,462 --> 00:42:59,497
Okay.

1062
00:42:59,963 --> 00:43:01,931
- Weak knees.
- Mmm.

1063
00:43:03,667 --> 00:43:05,001
Shall we light up some weed?

1064
00:43:06,169 --> 00:43:08,271
Let me guess, he's usually late.

1065
00:43:08,773 --> 00:43:10,140
He will call.

1066
00:43:14,845 --> 00:43:16,146
Maybe you should call him.

1067
00:43:18,081 --> 00:43:19,382
He's going to call.

1068
00:43:24,889 --> 00:43:26,320
[Kalli]
Danica, it's getting late.

1069
00:43:26,322 --> 00:43:27,689
And we have to get
this project done

1070
00:43:27,691 --> 00:43:29,292
for our meeting
in the morning.

1071
00:43:36,232 --> 00:43:40,001
Look, I'm sorry.
We were asking about him online,

1072
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:43,339
we talked to a few of his friends.
Maybe he got cold feet.

1073
00:43:43,606 --> 00:43:48,276
Or sometimes when people find
out that we're making a show

1074
00:43:48,278 --> 00:43:51,080
and it involves them,
they'll disappear.

1075
00:43:52,148 --> 00:43:53,349
He'll call.

1076
00:43:54,117 --> 00:43:56,350
We really should be going.

1077
00:43:56,352 --> 00:44:00,557
Yeah, and you don't deserve
to be treated like this.

1078
00:44:04,260 --> 00:44:06,396
I'm sorry you've been catfished.

1079
00:44:10,066 --> 00:44:13,701
[Tanya] Wait a minute, guys. Wait a minute.
Maybe I can roll with you.

1080
00:44:13,703 --> 00:44:14,737
What?

1081
00:44:15,672 --> 00:44:16,706
All right, then.

1082
00:44:18,974 --> 00:44:20,343
- Danica.
- Go.

1083
00:44:21,344 --> 00:44:22,679
I'll finish the project.

1084
00:44:23,913 --> 00:44:25,381
- No, I'll stay.
- Go.

1085
00:44:27,049 --> 00:44:28,418
Just go, please.

1086
00:44:29,985 --> 00:44:31,421
Are you okay?

1087
00:44:31,721 --> 00:44:32,755
Go, Kalli.

1088
00:44:34,557 --> 00:44:35,592
Okay.

1089
00:44:37,961 --> 00:44:40,463
[R&B song playing]

1090
00:45:28,645 --> 00:45:29,944
[song fades]

1091
00:45:29,946 --> 00:45:32,178
Don't tell me you've been
sitting there all night

1092
00:45:32,180 --> 00:45:34,017
waiting for that bastard
to call you.

1093
00:45:34,216 --> 00:45:35,484
No, I was working.

1094
00:45:36,485 --> 00:45:38,153
There's nothing on that screen.

1095
00:45:39,488 --> 00:45:40,823
You think this is funny.

1096
00:45:41,123 --> 00:45:43,557
No, look at your eyes all puffy.

1097
00:45:43,559 --> 00:45:46,061
And you got to be at work.
It's almost nine o'clock.

1098
00:45:46,395 --> 00:45:48,965
Come on, okay? You got played.

1099
00:45:49,298 --> 00:45:50,666
Get over it.

1100
00:45:51,667 --> 00:45:52,701
Okay?

1101
00:45:53,870 --> 00:45:55,203
This is sad.

1102
00:45:55,972 --> 00:45:57,306
Can't believe this.

1103
00:45:59,909 --> 00:46:01,141
Anything left in here?

1104
00:46:01,143 --> 00:46:02,678
I'll tell you what's sad.

1105
00:46:03,046 --> 00:46:05,211
Being in and out of jail

1106
00:46:05,213 --> 00:46:07,814
and sleeping
with everything that moves.

1107
00:46:07,816 --> 00:46:12,955
Not to mention all those tattoos you
got for Reginald spelled wrong.

1108
00:46:13,555 --> 00:46:17,024
I know you my sister,
but I will fuck you up.

1109
00:46:17,026 --> 00:46:20,095
I don't need this.
I don't need none of this shit.

1110
00:46:20,829 --> 00:46:22,798
Know what?
I don't even need to stay here.

1111
00:46:23,231 --> 00:46:25,367
- I'm gone.
- Then go.

1112
00:46:25,634 --> 00:46:29,669
And you don't spell bitch B-I-C-H.
It's B-I-T-C-H.

1113
00:46:29,671 --> 00:46:33,275
It's a creative
artistic choice, bitch!

1114
00:46:34,977 --> 00:46:37,746
I'll slap the black
off your ass. Shut up.

1115
00:46:39,047 --> 00:46:40,282
[door slams]

1116
00:46:40,616 --> 00:46:42,751
No, wait,
I need to get my shit!

1117
00:46:47,889 --> 00:46:49,123
Mama?

1118
00:46:50,392 --> 00:46:52,759
- Mama, it's Tanya.
- Who?

1119
00:46:52,761 --> 00:46:54,126
It's Tanya!

1120
00:46:54,128 --> 00:46:55,929
Oh, no. Tanya no here.

1121
00:46:55,931 --> 00:46:57,430
Mama, I know it's you.

1122
00:46:57,432 --> 00:46:59,399
No, "it's you"
no here, either.

1123
00:46:59,401 --> 00:47:01,103
Mama, I hear you at the window.

1124
00:47:01,770 --> 00:47:03,770
I no know, I no know.
What...

1125
00:47:03,772 --> 00:47:05,371
Mama, I know it's you!

1126
00:47:05,373 --> 00:47:06,808
Well, what do you want?

1127
00:47:07,442 --> 00:47:08,877
Danica put me out.

1128
00:47:10,144 --> 00:47:12,213
Mama, I need a place to stay.

1129
00:47:15,050 --> 00:47:16,384
You smoking weed?

1130
00:47:17,218 --> 00:47:18,452
No, I...

1131
00:47:19,186 --> 00:47:20,454
I have arthritis.

1132
00:47:21,056 --> 00:47:22,356
Is that hereditary?

1133
00:47:24,026 --> 00:47:25,426
No, it's arthritis.

1134
00:47:26,094 --> 00:47:27,426
Why did she put you out?

1135
00:47:27,428 --> 00:47:29,196
She mad at me
'cause she got catfished.

1136
00:47:29,463 --> 00:47:31,465
- Who, by Charlie?
- Yeah, you know him?

1137
00:47:31,700 --> 00:47:34,636
Yeah. I don't know him, I know about him.
He's just...

1138
00:47:35,103 --> 00:47:36,604
seemed too good to be true.

1139
00:47:37,238 --> 00:47:38,738
I guess
you just gotta call her.

1140
00:47:38,740 --> 00:47:41,475
Mama, I just told you
she put me out.

1141
00:47:42,044 --> 00:47:46,347
It's so funny. This connection
is so rickety. Hello?

1142
00:47:46,681 --> 00:47:48,782
What?
Mama, you in the window.

1143
00:47:48,784 --> 00:47:50,518
No, I can't...
I'm sorry, what?

1144
00:47:50,718 --> 00:47:52,351
We not on no cell phone, Mama.

1145
00:47:52,353 --> 00:47:53,787
I can't hear you, baby.
I can't hear...

1146
00:47:53,789 --> 00:47:55,688
- Oh, my goodness. I can't hear ya.
- Mama!

1147
00:47:55,690 --> 00:47:57,857
- I don't know what's happening.
- Mama, stop playing.

1148
00:47:57,859 --> 00:47:59,959
- The whole thing is all messed up.
- Mama, don't play like that.

1149
00:47:59,961 --> 00:48:01,460
- Just feel bad about the whole thing.
- What?

1150
00:48:01,462 --> 00:48:03,195
Mama, where I'ma stay?

1151
00:48:03,197 --> 00:48:04,632
Mama, where am I gonna stay?

1152
00:48:05,067 --> 00:48:06,101
Mama?

1153
00:48:06,333 --> 00:48:08,369
Mom? Mama?

1154
00:48:08,569 --> 00:48:10,838
Why you gonna do me
like this, Ma?

1155
00:48:11,073 --> 00:48:12,306
Mama?

1156
00:48:24,152 --> 00:48:25,187
Hey.

1157
00:48:26,088 --> 00:48:27,922
Hey, you can't be
out here sleeping, ma'am.

1158
00:48:28,190 --> 00:48:29,590
- Ma'am.
- I ain't got no phone!

1159
00:48:29,824 --> 00:48:31,859
- Shit.
- Tanya, I thought you were homeless.

1160
00:48:32,293 --> 00:48:33,828
I thought you was the police.

1161
00:48:34,196 --> 00:48:35,661
So, I'm like,

1162
00:48:35,663 --> 00:48:37,563
"Girl, if he real,
have him call you."

1163
00:48:37,565 --> 00:48:38,997
- Right.
- And then he didn't call,

1164
00:48:38,999 --> 00:48:40,501
and then she wanna get
all mad at me.

1165
00:48:40,935 --> 00:48:42,568
Wait a minute.
So, the dude ain't real?

1166
00:48:42,570 --> 00:48:44,002
No, the dude ain't real!

1167
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:45,671
And she trying
to get all mad at me,

1168
00:48:45,673 --> 00:48:47,306
and I'm like,
"Bitch, don't play with me.

1169
00:48:47,308 --> 00:48:49,241
I will fuck you up, okay?

1170
00:48:49,243 --> 00:48:51,343
I'm your sister and I been
looking out for your bitch ass.

1171
00:48:51,345 --> 00:48:53,112
Keep on messing with me,
see what happens.

1172
00:48:53,114 --> 00:48:55,547
I was trying to look out for you.
Why you getting closer, bitch?

1173
00:48:55,549 --> 00:48:56,682
- Tanya!
- Get up outta my face!"

1174
00:48:56,684 --> 00:48:57,852
- Tanya! Tanya.
- What?

1175
00:48:58,352 --> 00:49:00,586
- That's your sister!
- Have you seen <i>The First 48?</i>

1176
00:49:00,588 --> 00:49:02,286
- <i>First 48?</i>
- Yeah, <i>The First 48.</i>

1177
00:49:02,288 --> 00:49:04,189
They say on that when
somebody get killed, okay,

1178
00:49:04,191 --> 00:49:05,724
check with the family first

1179
00:49:05,726 --> 00:49:07,459
'cause most likely
it's a family member.

1180
00:49:07,461 --> 00:49:10,531
I will F-U-C-K some D-N-A U-P.

1181
00:49:11,364 --> 00:49:12,800
Follow my shit, nigga!

1182
00:49:18,506 --> 00:49:21,339
- Girl, you look like hell.
- Sorry.

1183
00:49:21,341 --> 00:49:22,676
Come on, they're waiting.

1184
00:49:24,344 --> 00:49:25,579
Did you get it done?

1185
00:49:28,015 --> 00:49:29,282
Did you get it done?

1186
00:49:30,217 --> 00:49:34,088
Look, I know this is hard for
you, but this is your job.

1187
00:49:34,287 --> 00:49:35,788
That promotion is yours, but...

1188
00:49:35,790 --> 00:49:37,792
What is going on with this hair?

1189
00:49:38,458 --> 00:49:39,725
I'm trying to help you.

1190
00:49:39,727 --> 00:49:41,294
- You look a mess.
- [Lauren] Ladies!

1191
00:49:41,695 --> 00:49:43,630
Hello? We're waiting.

1192
00:49:49,837 --> 00:49:52,773
Okay! I've found the missing team.
[chuckles]

1193
00:49:53,107 --> 00:49:54,875
[speaking French]

1194
00:49:55,642 --> 00:49:57,144
[clears throat]

1195
00:49:57,778 --> 00:50:01,282
[exhales] These are the clients.
This is Barney.

1196
00:50:01,949 --> 00:50:05,516
Barney, Danica is one
of our brightest minds.

1197
00:50:05,518 --> 00:50:07,186
Which is why
we gave her the project.

1198
00:50:07,188 --> 00:50:10,490
Danica, can't wait to hear
what you've come up with.

1199
00:50:11,992 --> 00:50:13,027
The floor is yours.

1200
00:50:14,761 --> 00:50:17,463
What I was able
to come up with is...

1201
00:50:20,167 --> 00:50:21,068
The List.

1202
00:50:22,569 --> 00:50:23,903
For all that you wish for.

1203
00:50:27,041 --> 00:50:27,941
<i>Oui, oui.</i>

1204
00:50:29,609 --> 00:50:30,844
Is this a joke?

1205
00:50:31,744 --> 00:50:33,477
She's been
going through a lot.

1206
00:50:33,479 --> 00:50:35,780
Oh, she's been going
through a lot. Oh!

1207
00:50:35,782 --> 00:50:37,884
Danica, let's go talk
about this for a minute.

1208
00:50:40,086 --> 00:50:40,987
<i>Pardon.</i>

1209
00:50:44,958 --> 00:50:46,826
Guess you didn't get
the promotion, huh?

1210
00:50:47,126 --> 00:50:48,027
Nope.

1211
00:50:48,428 --> 00:50:50,094
I am suspended indefinitely

1212
00:50:50,096 --> 00:50:52,632
until the board reviews
what happened.

1213
00:50:54,301 --> 00:50:55,535
I'm sorry.

1214
00:51:02,309 --> 00:51:04,475
- I brought you coffee.
- If I wanted coffee,

1215
00:51:04,477 --> 00:51:06,412
I would've stopped
to get it, but thank you.

1216
00:51:09,449 --> 00:51:11,182
[Tanya]
Hey, what happened?

1217
00:51:11,184 --> 00:51:13,184
She didn't want the coffee. She
didn't want the rose either.

1218
00:51:13,186 --> 00:51:15,119
See, that's because she's being
a straight-up bitch.

1219
00:51:15,121 --> 00:51:16,721
Take me to the apartment.

1220
00:51:16,723 --> 00:51:18,155
Tanya, I got a business
to run and you at work.

1221
00:51:18,157 --> 00:51:19,724
How many times
we been through this?

1222
00:51:19,726 --> 00:51:21,459
Nigga, you're selling coffee,

1223
00:51:21,461 --> 00:51:22,560
you're not changing the world.

1224
00:51:22,562 --> 00:51:24,063
Take me to the apartment.

1225
00:51:24,797 --> 00:51:26,398
- Do I got a choice?
- No!

1226
00:51:28,968 --> 00:51:32,402
I can't stand this girl. You
know, I'm taking all this stuff.

1227
00:51:32,404 --> 00:51:33,640
You better not.

1228
00:51:35,675 --> 00:51:37,343
Oh, I didn't know
you was here.

1229
00:51:37,644 --> 00:51:40,445
- I can't stand your ass at all.
- Good.

1230
00:51:41,513 --> 00:51:43,446
And I'ma get
the rest of my clothes.

1231
00:51:43,448 --> 00:51:45,151
You don't have any clothes.

1232
00:51:45,584 --> 00:51:47,419
Well, you said
I could have this stuff.

1233
00:51:48,288 --> 00:51:49,588
Fine. Take whatever you want.

1234
00:51:50,189 --> 00:51:53,226
Good, I will. And I'ma take
that wedding dress, too.

1235
00:51:53,558 --> 00:51:54,928
Oh, no, you're not.
No, you're not.

1236
00:51:55,594 --> 00:51:57,063
- [Tanya] Yes, I am.
- No, you're...

1237
00:51:59,198 --> 00:52:00,264
What is he doing here?

1238
00:52:00,266 --> 00:52:01,665
Can you wait outside?

1239
00:52:01,667 --> 00:52:03,100
Uh-uh. Don't be
that mean to him.

1240
00:52:03,102 --> 00:52:04,902
Mm-mmm,
he is a good man, okay?

1241
00:52:04,904 --> 00:52:06,837
Don't be mad at him
because you got catfished

1242
00:52:06,839 --> 00:52:08,473
and your feelings is hurt.

1243
00:52:08,942 --> 00:52:11,543
This is my house and
I want him to stay outside.

1244
00:52:13,346 --> 00:52:16,182
Frank, don't you move.
You stay right there.

1245
00:52:17,150 --> 00:52:18,217
Fine.

1246
00:52:18,684 --> 00:52:20,284
You're just like
all the other ones.

1247
00:52:20,286 --> 00:52:21,953
Sorry. Stay.

1248
00:52:21,955 --> 00:52:24,188
Uh-uh, Frank
is a good man, okay?

1249
00:52:24,190 --> 00:52:26,623
- You will not talk to him like that.
- Thank you, Tanya.

1250
00:52:26,625 --> 00:52:27,826
Girl, bye.

1251
00:52:28,227 --> 00:52:29,459
Bye.

1252
00:52:29,461 --> 00:52:31,030
Get your shit and go.

1253
00:52:31,364 --> 00:52:33,496
I will.
I will get your shit

1254
00:52:33,498 --> 00:52:35,532
that's not my shit
and I will go.

1255
00:52:35,534 --> 00:52:36,668
I sure will.

1256
00:52:36,935 --> 00:52:38,768
Frank, come in here
and help me get this TV.

1257
00:52:38,770 --> 00:52:39,705
I'm taking this shit, too.

1258
00:52:40,139 --> 00:52:42,708
Ooh, and this lamp.
It's gorgeous.

1259
00:52:44,710 --> 00:52:46,576
[Tanya] She should not be
talking to you like that.

1260
00:52:46,578 --> 00:52:47,677
Get mad, nigga!

1261
00:52:47,679 --> 00:52:49,248
- [grunting]
- Yeah!

1262
00:52:49,681 --> 00:52:51,282
- Yeah!
- [grunts]

1263
00:52:51,284 --> 00:52:52,951
Whoa!
You making me wet.

1264
00:52:53,386 --> 00:52:55,187
I like that, I like that.

1265
00:52:55,421 --> 00:52:56,755
Look, I can't be mad
at the girl.

1266
00:52:57,189 --> 00:52:58,788
I can't be mad at her,
she's such a...

1267
00:52:58,790 --> 00:53:00,623
If you say
that she a nice girl,

1268
00:53:00,625 --> 00:53:03,226
I promise you I will
punch you dead in your head.

1269
00:53:03,228 --> 00:53:05,497
- I didn't say shit.
- Thank you.

1270
00:53:06,131 --> 00:53:07,232
Keep driving.

1271
00:53:08,233 --> 00:53:09,267
You want some head?

1272
00:53:11,303 --> 00:53:12,204
Let me get you some.

1273
00:53:13,271 --> 00:53:14,806
Wait, Tanya. Tanya!

1274
00:53:15,441 --> 00:53:16,573
Tanya!

1275
00:53:16,575 --> 00:53:18,575
What kind of seat?
Dang it.

1276
00:53:18,577 --> 00:53:19,811
Tanya, it's a seatbelt.

1277
00:53:20,212 --> 00:53:21,847
It won't come undone.

1278
00:53:22,714 --> 00:53:24,182
This thing
is getting tighter and...

1279
00:53:25,650 --> 00:53:27,786
Why your car won't let me
suck your dick?

1280
00:53:31,623 --> 00:53:33,625
[door opens]

1281
00:53:35,527 --> 00:53:37,093
- [sighs]
- [door closes]

1282
00:53:37,095 --> 00:53:39,131
I knew I should've
took your key, Tanya.

1283
00:53:39,664 --> 00:53:42,701
Is that any way
to talk to your mother?

1284
00:53:44,870 --> 00:53:46,705
Hey, do you know
that your, uh...

1285
00:53:47,406 --> 00:53:48,707
your phone is off?

1286
00:53:49,441 --> 00:53:51,841
Yeah. I changed the number.

1287
00:53:51,843 --> 00:53:53,644
And my email.

1288
00:53:54,046 --> 00:53:58,116
Ah. All right.
Well, I brought the wine.

1289
00:53:59,284 --> 00:54:02,287
'Course it's yours,
but I did bring it.

1290
00:54:04,423 --> 00:54:05,556
What's the matter?

1291
00:54:06,224 --> 00:54:07,390
Mama.

1292
00:54:07,392 --> 00:54:08,994
- Come on.
- Everything.

1293
00:54:14,466 --> 00:54:19,971
[sighs] I just want what you and Daddy had.
It was so beautiful.

1294
00:54:20,571 --> 00:54:21,639
Right, Mom?

1295
00:54:22,507 --> 00:54:23,542
Yeah.

1296
00:54:24,109 --> 00:54:25,741
I mean, the way you would
wake up in the morning

1297
00:54:25,743 --> 00:54:27,145
and make him breakfast.

1298
00:54:27,711 --> 00:54:29,181
And he would kiss you.

1299
00:54:29,814 --> 00:54:31,216
[chuckles] Yes.

1300
00:54:32,417 --> 00:54:35,454
You wrote a list
and it came to, right?

1301
00:54:35,953 --> 00:54:37,489
- Yeah, yeah.
- Yeah, and...

1302
00:54:37,922 --> 00:54:39,291
why didn't this work for me?

1303
00:54:40,158 --> 00:54:42,026
And you know what
the worst of it is, Mama?

1304
00:54:42,693 --> 00:54:43,661
I'm smart.

1305
00:54:44,096 --> 00:54:46,496
Am I that lonely and hard-up

1306
00:54:46,498 --> 00:54:48,366
that I would fall for this?

1307
00:54:48,899 --> 00:54:53,205
Honey,
the line in the Serengeti

1308
00:54:53,871 --> 00:54:56,073
is in the sands of time.

1309
00:54:56,974 --> 00:54:58,709
Mama, are you high?

1310
00:54:59,377 --> 00:55:00,245
Yeah.

1311
00:55:00,878 --> 00:55:04,349
I just grew a new plant
called "I'ma Fuck You Up."

1312
00:55:04,882 --> 00:55:07,149
And it did. [laughs]

1313
00:55:07,151 --> 00:55:08,052
But wait.

1314
00:55:08,652 --> 00:55:12,324
That doesn't change the fact
that I have to tell you this.

1315
00:55:12,756 --> 00:55:14,125
Is this serious now, Mom?

1316
00:55:14,526 --> 00:55:17,962
Yeah, I suggest you grab it
while I can still focus.

1317
00:55:18,262 --> 00:55:19,296
Okay.

1318
00:55:21,132 --> 00:55:24,101
You are an emotional hoarder.

1319
00:55:24,402 --> 00:55:27,703
You don't let anything out.
You just hold on to everything.

1320
00:55:27,705 --> 00:55:32,274
I was thinking about Bailey, you know, and
I realized you never dealt with that.

1321
00:55:32,276 --> 00:55:37,446
But you just... you just move
on from things, you know?

1322
00:55:37,448 --> 00:55:40,251
And I know you're hurt.
I know you're still hurt.

1323
00:55:40,985 --> 00:55:42,818
But it's not like
you call anybody and say

1324
00:55:42,820 --> 00:55:44,788
"Hey, can you come talk to me?
Can you do this?"

1325
00:55:45,089 --> 00:55:47,523
You know, you're just, you come
home and you shut the door,

1326
00:55:47,525 --> 00:55:51,360
and you disappear for three or four
days and then, like the Queen of Sheba,

1327
00:55:51,362 --> 00:55:58,302
boom, you're back and you wanna talk,
you're so deep. It's so crazy.

1328
00:55:58,802 --> 00:56:00,371
What you're doing
is not healthy.

1329
00:56:00,838 --> 00:56:01,705
I know.

1330
00:56:02,373 --> 00:56:05,142
But you always taught us
to get up and go on.

1331
00:56:05,409 --> 00:56:09,280
But I taught you to get up and go
on after you handle your business.

1332
00:56:09,647 --> 00:56:11,480
And maybe try
a little of my weed.

1333
00:56:11,482 --> 00:56:13,315
I'm telling you, it's so good.

1334
00:56:13,317 --> 00:56:16,253
- I can't. I can't do that, Mom.
- You would love this.

1335
00:56:16,719 --> 00:56:18,622
- Since when?
- I get tested at work.

1336
00:56:19,290 --> 00:56:22,059
- All right, well, what was I saying?
- Yeah.

1337
00:56:22,927 --> 00:56:24,725
I know you're hurt.

1338
00:56:24,727 --> 00:56:26,163
This feels like hell.

1339
00:56:26,530 --> 00:56:30,167
And I was mean to Tanya.
She won't talk to me.

1340
00:56:30,634 --> 00:56:32,069
I know she was
only trying to help.

1341
00:56:32,603 --> 00:56:33,836
She was.

1342
00:56:34,672 --> 00:56:36,307
But, like, watch this.

1343
00:56:36,839 --> 00:56:37,973
Tanya!

1344
00:56:37,975 --> 00:56:39,776
[door opens]

1345
00:56:44,248 --> 00:56:45,449
Magic!

1346
00:56:47,384 --> 00:56:48,419
What are you doing here?

1347
00:56:49,018 --> 00:56:51,388
'Cause it's cold
and it's about to rain outside.

1348
00:56:51,888 --> 00:56:52,922
And I'm homeless.

1349
00:56:53,390 --> 00:56:55,157
You know
I didn't want you to leave.

1350
00:56:55,159 --> 00:56:57,294
[sighs]
Music to my ears.

1351
00:56:57,961 --> 00:57:01,130
[scoffs] Mama, you did all that so
she could get back in the house?

1352
00:57:01,398 --> 00:57:05,068
Absolutely. 'Cause this bitch
can't stay with me no more.

1353
00:57:05,902 --> 00:57:07,003
Okay?

1354
00:57:07,438 --> 00:57:08,472
Bye, baby.

1355
00:57:08,771 --> 00:57:09,772
I love y'all.

1356
00:57:10,241 --> 00:57:12,276
- And I'll see y'all.
- Bye, Miss Lola.

1357
00:57:12,476 --> 00:57:14,777
- I love you, Mama.
- Love you, Mom.

1358
00:57:15,346 --> 00:57:17,314
- [door closes]
- [Kalli laughs]

1359
00:57:22,419 --> 00:57:23,454
I'm sorry.

1360
00:57:23,920 --> 00:57:24,986
I was hurt.

1361
00:57:24,988 --> 00:57:26,590
You was about to be bald.

1362
00:57:27,023 --> 00:57:28,523
Okay? I would've
showed you some hurt.

1363
00:57:28,525 --> 00:57:30,728
I would've snatched all
your edges out your head.

1364
00:57:31,361 --> 00:57:34,563
- I'm sorry.
- And you talked bad about my tattoo?

1365
00:57:34,565 --> 00:57:35,765
You know I loved Reginald.

1366
00:57:36,165 --> 00:57:37,965
It got infected and everything.

1367
00:57:37,967 --> 00:57:39,402
That was real love.

1368
00:57:39,637 --> 00:57:41,070
Penicillin, bitch.

1369
00:57:41,371 --> 00:57:42,839
Okay. I'm sorry.

1370
00:57:44,440 --> 00:57:46,342
I'm just embarrassed,
that's all.

1371
00:57:47,310 --> 00:57:49,178
How could something
like this happen to me?

1372
00:57:49,546 --> 00:57:51,580
You gave your heart.
That's never wrong.

1373
00:57:51,582 --> 00:57:54,583
Except for when you give it to a
man you ain't never seen before.

1374
00:57:54,585 --> 00:57:56,917
- You're not helping.
- I'm just saying.

1375
00:57:56,919 --> 00:57:59,422
- This shit is embarrassing.
- Okay.

1376
00:57:59,856 --> 00:58:01,124
Maybe you could leave.

1377
00:58:01,491 --> 00:58:04,191
What? I'm sorry. My bad.

1378
00:58:04,193 --> 00:58:07,864
Okay, now we need to go and find this
son of a bitch who catfished me.

1379
00:58:08,064 --> 00:58:10,598
Well, I got the address, girl.
I got his address.

1380
00:58:10,600 --> 00:58:12,935
Now, all I'ma need...
Wait, you got some cash?

1381
00:58:13,202 --> 00:58:17,705
'Cause we gonna need lime
and we gonna need a saw.

1382
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,275
We gonna need some plastic.

1383
00:58:19,642 --> 00:58:20,677
I gotta go to the bathroom.

1384
00:58:21,577 --> 00:58:25,079
Yeah, that's good. You need to go
ahead and let all the liquids out,

1385
00:58:25,081 --> 00:58:26,813
'cause you don't wanna
leave no DNA.

1386
00:58:26,815 --> 00:58:28,783
'Cause killing a man
is hard work.

1387
00:58:28,785 --> 00:58:30,918
Every time you try to kill a man,
you gonna squirt a little pee.

1388
00:58:30,920 --> 00:58:32,353
I know that for sure.

1389
00:58:32,355 --> 00:58:34,924
That's just the way it goes.
You gonna squirt.

1390
00:58:36,693 --> 00:58:38,561
[Kalli]
This looks like <i>Deliverance.</i>

1391
00:58:39,329 --> 00:58:40,827
[Tanya] Well, that's the
address right there.

1392
00:58:40,829 --> 00:58:43,299
[Danica]
Um, you know what?

1393
00:58:43,666 --> 00:58:44,734
We shouldn't do this.

1394
00:58:45,068 --> 00:58:47,036
[Tanya]
What? No, we doing this.

1395
00:58:48,671 --> 00:58:49,971
- Okay.
- [Danica] Tanya.

1396
00:58:51,006 --> 00:58:52,508
Y'all get y'all asses
out the car.

1397
00:58:55,010 --> 00:58:57,246
Hey. Y'all know Lawrence?

1398
00:58:57,879 --> 00:58:59,246
There he is, right there.

1399
00:58:59,248 --> 00:59:00,916
Aw, yeah, you Lawrence?

1400
00:59:04,119 --> 00:59:06,187
- You Lawrence.
- And how you know?

1401
00:59:06,189 --> 00:59:08,957
'Cause your Walmart nametag
says so, homeboy.

1402
00:59:09,292 --> 00:59:12,495
Okay, touché. You got me.

1403
00:59:12,795 --> 00:59:15,596
I am a greeter at Walmart.
How may I help you?

1404
00:59:15,598 --> 00:59:18,033
Oh, I'm just here
to mess your life up today.

1405
00:59:18,368 --> 00:59:21,471
How you gonna ruin my life
more than it already is?

1406
00:59:22,104 --> 00:59:23,238
Wait a minute.

1407
00:59:23,673 --> 00:59:25,508
- I know you.
- Um...

1408
00:59:25,974 --> 00:59:28,778
- Danica.
- Did this nigga just say your name?

1409
00:59:29,111 --> 00:59:31,177
Danica. Freaking Danica!

1410
00:59:31,179 --> 00:59:33,683
You made it.
Just like you promised.

1411
00:59:34,316 --> 00:59:35,551
You didn't shave, did you?

1412
00:59:36,652 --> 00:59:38,017
You got that vintage?

1413
00:59:38,019 --> 00:59:39,321
She got the vintage.

1414
00:59:39,722 --> 00:59:42,290
- No.
- She got that Mo Cheeks down there, yeah.

1415
00:59:42,725 --> 00:59:45,024
You got on that highway
for the dick.

1416
00:59:45,026 --> 00:59:47,195
You drove a thousand miles
for the dick.

1417
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:50,263
- You paid tolls for the dick.
- [Danica] No.

1418
00:59:50,265 --> 00:59:54,670
- This is not the voice that I talked to.
- Oh, yes, that's me.

1419
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:56,637
- It can't...
- I'm the man that said those things.

1420
00:59:56,639 --> 00:59:58,471
See, I got a little thing
on my phone

1421
00:59:58,473 --> 01:00:00,509
that make me sound
like Idris.

1422
01:00:00,843 --> 01:00:03,813
It's a app. It's the Idris app.
[laughs]

1423
01:00:04,012 --> 01:00:05,247
Made you wet, didn't it?

1424
01:00:05,681 --> 01:00:06,847
That's what the app says.

1425
01:00:06,849 --> 01:00:08,016
Says "Guaranteed to wet 'em."

1426
01:00:09,017 --> 01:00:11,653
You were thinking about going to
the car to get that umbrella.

1427
01:00:11,920 --> 01:00:12,822
Ain't you?

1428
01:00:13,321 --> 01:00:14,589
Feel like you just
got out the pool.

1429
01:00:15,290 --> 01:00:16,625
You know I'm the right height.

1430
01:00:17,058 --> 01:00:18,593
I could get up in there
right now.

1431
01:00:19,194 --> 01:00:20,228
You think this my hair?

1432
01:00:20,562 --> 01:00:22,729
No, this the ghost
of pussy past.

1433
01:00:22,731 --> 01:00:24,032
This is pussy hair, girl.

1434
01:00:24,366 --> 01:00:26,099
Motorboating.
[exhales through lips]

1435
01:00:26,101 --> 01:00:27,400
If you come with me, woman,

1436
01:00:27,402 --> 01:00:29,004
we'll get all
the good parking spaces.

1437
01:00:29,604 --> 01:00:32,272
- Please let me beat his ass.
- No, Tanya, no.

1438
01:00:32,274 --> 01:00:34,242
Look, this is...
this is pathetic.

1439
01:00:34,443 --> 01:00:36,476
Okay? You shouldn't
do this to anyone

1440
01:00:36,478 --> 01:00:38,413
Oh, but I wanna do it to you.

1441
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,482
I wanna do it to you so bad.

1442
01:00:40,849 --> 01:00:42,784
I wanna...
I wanna kick your ass.

1443
01:00:43,251 --> 01:00:45,587
Girl, we could have
so much fun.

1444
01:00:45,921 --> 01:00:46,954
I just lay there.

1445
01:00:47,389 --> 01:00:49,055
Don't worry
about the bottom legs,

1446
01:00:49,057 --> 01:00:50,559
the middle one's working fine.

1447
01:00:50,892 --> 01:00:52,561
It's working right now.

1448
01:00:52,960 --> 01:00:55,397
Just hop on.
Take it for a spin.

1449
01:00:56,198 --> 01:01:00,669
You could just bounce and bounce and
bounce, I'll just be laying there.

1450
01:01:01,001 --> 01:01:04,473
I don't know if we're having
sex or I'm changing oil.

1451
01:01:04,906 --> 01:01:06,208
I'm about to whoop his ass.

1452
01:01:06,708 --> 01:01:08,241
- [Danica] No, Tanya!
- Somebody get this bitch off me!

1453
01:01:08,243 --> 01:01:09,442
- [Danica] Tanya!
- [Kalli] Tanya!

1454
01:01:09,444 --> 01:01:10,745
Get off!
[mimics karate yell]

1455
01:01:12,146 --> 01:01:13,615
- [Kalli] Tanya!
- [Danica] Tanya!

1456
01:01:14,182 --> 01:01:16,181
- [man] This gonna be good.
- Better watch out.

1457
01:01:16,183 --> 01:01:17,385
I know ka-wheelie.

1458
01:01:17,853 --> 01:01:19,117
What the fuck is ka-wheelie?

1459
01:01:19,119 --> 01:01:21,621
Oh, yeah,
that's wheelchair karate.

1460
01:01:21,623 --> 01:01:22,757
It'll fuck you up.

1461
01:01:23,057 --> 01:01:24,024
[Danica] No, no!

1462
01:01:24,359 --> 01:01:26,526
[mimics karate yells]

1463
01:01:26,528 --> 01:01:27,762
- I'ma go in.
- [Danica] Tanya.

1464
01:01:28,630 --> 01:01:29,898
[gibberish]

1465
01:01:30,432 --> 01:01:31,967
[man]
Oh, this gonna be good.

1466
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:35,234
- What?
- I'll mess you up, homie.

1467
01:01:35,236 --> 01:01:36,705
Stay off the damn computer!

1468
01:01:37,271 --> 01:01:38,505
What? No, no!

1469
01:01:38,507 --> 01:01:40,274
- No, no!
- Tanya, no!

1470
01:01:41,275 --> 01:01:43,041
She fittin' to burn his ass up!

1471
01:01:43,043 --> 01:01:45,912
[screaming]

1472
01:01:45,914 --> 01:01:47,414
He ain't never moved that fast.

1473
01:01:47,682 --> 01:01:50,485
- Pop that wheelie, Lawrence.
- That's what your old ass get.

1474
01:01:50,719 --> 01:01:53,553
Didn't Michael Jackson teach you anything?
That shit is flammable.

1475
01:01:53,555 --> 01:01:56,390
[Lawrence screaming and wincing]

1476
01:01:59,460 --> 01:02:01,260
[Tanya]
I just witnessed a miracle.

1477
01:02:01,262 --> 01:02:04,532
Yeah, I healed that motherfucker.
Made him walk again.

1478
01:02:06,066 --> 01:02:09,234
And so she barely got out of the
bed and ended up on the couch.

1479
01:02:09,236 --> 01:02:10,937
I got the idea. Perfect idea.

1480
01:02:10,939 --> 01:02:12,939
I take her some coffee.
Your sister loves my coffee.

1481
01:02:12,941 --> 01:02:14,139
I drive it to her house, Tanya.

1482
01:02:14,141 --> 01:02:16,074
If you want to, go for it.

1483
01:02:16,076 --> 01:02:17,478
But that's a bitch move.

1484
01:02:17,678 --> 01:02:18,811
What?

1485
01:02:18,813 --> 01:02:20,180
Whatever. I care about her.

1486
01:02:20,782 --> 01:02:23,649
- Aww. Oh...
- Tanya, what are you doing?

1487
01:02:23,651 --> 01:02:26,251
- I'm trying to turn off your bitch switch.
- Girl, stop.

1488
01:02:26,253 --> 01:02:29,156
- And you got a customer.
- And you have a vagina.

1489
01:02:30,825 --> 01:02:31,725
Can I help you?

1490
01:02:32,027 --> 01:02:33,325
<i>Walter, I don't deserve you.</i>

1491
01:02:33,327 --> 01:02:34,695
Girl, he's gonna hurt you.

1492
01:02:35,329 --> 01:02:37,364
- <i>Nah, I wouldn't put it that way.</i>
- That's what they do.

1493
01:02:39,099 --> 01:02:40,734
<i>But, okay.</i>

1494
01:02:47,374 --> 01:02:49,141
- <i>You okay?</i>
- [knock on door]

1495
01:02:49,143 --> 01:02:51,211
- <i>Yeah.</i>
- Come in.

1496
01:02:54,214 --> 01:02:55,816
- [door closes]
- Hi.

1497
01:02:56,984 --> 01:02:58,586
Hi. What are you...

1498
01:02:59,453 --> 01:03:01,320
- Why?
- I'm sorry, you said "come in,"

1499
01:03:01,322 --> 01:03:04,059
so I came in
to bring you coffee.

1500
01:03:04,458 --> 01:03:06,694
[chuckles] I'm sorry.

1501
01:03:07,928 --> 01:03:14,468
I've been such an ass and... Because I'm
going through a rough couple of days.

1502
01:03:15,636 --> 01:03:17,805
Mmm... Mmm.

1503
01:03:18,339 --> 01:03:19,406
How much have you heard?

1504
01:03:19,807 --> 01:03:22,476
Don't lie. I'm sure
she told you everything.

1505
01:03:23,243 --> 01:03:25,245
- I know enough.
- [both chuckle]

1506
01:03:26,046 --> 01:03:28,549
Please don't tell me she
sent you here to ask me out.

1507
01:03:29,283 --> 01:03:30,851
I'm just here
to bring you some coffee.

1508
01:03:31,184 --> 01:03:32,386
- There you go.
- Thank you.

1509
01:03:32,820 --> 01:03:35,723
But I'm going to lay
on that sofa all day.

1510
01:03:36,423 --> 01:03:42,529
So, I won't be needing any caffeine
until I don't feel embarrassed anymore.

1511
01:03:43,162 --> 01:03:46,197
Come on, Danica, he's the one that
should be embarrassed, not you.

1512
01:03:46,199 --> 01:03:47,434
Come on.

1513
01:03:47,935 --> 01:03:49,202
You know that, right?

1514
01:03:52,706 --> 01:03:54,742
- You wanna sit?
- Sure.

1515
01:03:55,308 --> 01:03:56,409
[softly] Okay.

1516
01:03:59,212 --> 01:04:00,846
No, did that really happen?

1517
01:04:00,848 --> 01:04:03,383
Scout's honor. Yes, it
really happened, I promise.

1518
01:04:03,817 --> 01:04:06,785
- What? Are you... No.
- I was standing in the rain.

1519
01:04:06,787 --> 01:04:08,654
- It's like a torrential downpour, right?
- Right.

1520
01:04:08,656 --> 01:04:11,524
Windows down, music blasting.
I'm on my knees.

1521
01:04:11,825 --> 01:04:12,926
And I got bad knees.

1522
01:04:13,459 --> 01:04:14,760
And I'm singing, right?

1523
01:04:14,762 --> 01:04:17,328
<i>♪ I'm down on bended knee ♪</i>

1524
01:04:17,330 --> 01:04:18,964
I'm like really... <i>♪ Yeah ♪</i>

1525
01:04:18,966 --> 01:04:20,968
- Are you kidding me?
- Nah, hell, nah.

1526
01:04:21,668 --> 01:04:23,334
She didn't even open the door.

1527
01:04:23,336 --> 01:04:25,204
- Oh, my God. Wait...
- Can you believe it?

1528
01:04:25,806 --> 01:04:27,739
- I love that song.
- Yeah, me too.

1529
01:04:27,741 --> 01:04:29,507
- That's what I'm saying.
- I might've opened the door.

1530
01:04:29,509 --> 01:04:31,377
Would you have opened...
Wait...

1531
01:04:32,846 --> 01:04:34,547
Tell me what happened
to your ex.

1532
01:04:34,882 --> 01:04:35,983
It was all me.

1533
01:04:36,649 --> 01:04:38,384
That's what happened.
It was all me.

1534
01:04:39,619 --> 01:04:41,187
I never hear a man say that.

1535
01:04:41,688 --> 01:04:44,223
Well, shit, you gotta be in truth
to know it, but yeah, it was...

1536
01:04:44,624 --> 01:04:51,397
In my case, I was young and I was stupid
and I was raised by a single mother.

1537
01:04:52,432 --> 01:04:54,032
And I started hanging with
the wrong crowd, you know?

1538
01:04:54,034 --> 01:04:56,467
Like, I was the full
stereotype kind of guy.

1539
01:04:56,469 --> 01:04:57,837
Like, totally, that was me.

1540
01:04:58,337 --> 01:05:00,707
So, when I got out of jail I said
to myself, "just change it."

1541
01:05:01,274 --> 01:05:04,241
You know? I mean, I really
looked at myself long and hard,

1542
01:05:04,243 --> 01:05:05,411
and I said "Just change it."

1543
01:05:05,712 --> 01:05:07,179
I didn't want to become my dad.

1544
01:05:07,181 --> 01:05:08,579
I saw my dad
go into an alleyway

1545
01:05:08,581 --> 01:05:09,780
when I was seven years old.

1546
01:05:09,782 --> 01:05:11,617
He was going
to get heroin and...

1547
01:05:12,585 --> 01:05:15,352
you know, the kids saw him
going into the alleyway as well,

1548
01:05:15,354 --> 01:05:16,689
and I was so embarrassed.

1549
01:05:17,023 --> 01:05:19,290
I didn't really have anybody
to show me the way,

1550
01:05:19,292 --> 01:05:21,225
- tell me what not to do.
- Hmm.

1551
01:05:21,227 --> 01:05:22,895
So, I ended up in jail.

1552
01:05:24,163 --> 01:05:25,199
But enough of that.

1553
01:05:25,531 --> 01:05:27,567
If you really want to be happy,

1554
01:05:28,267 --> 01:05:29,402
then just change it.

1555
01:05:29,702 --> 01:05:32,805
You will get past this.
You will get over it.

1556
01:05:33,372 --> 01:05:35,308
And you will live
to love another day.

1557
01:05:35,675 --> 01:05:36,776
Trust me.

1558
01:05:42,115 --> 01:05:43,449
You know what? Uh...

1559
01:05:44,417 --> 01:05:46,586
I should get back.
I need to get back.

1560
01:05:49,354 --> 01:05:50,590
What are you doing?

1561
01:05:55,061 --> 01:05:55,962
What are you doing?

1562
01:05:56,763 --> 01:05:57,663
Shut up.

1566
01:07:09,202 --> 01:07:10,735
Can you go home now?

1567
01:07:15,440 --> 01:07:16,608
Yeah.

[cell phone ringing]

1570
01:07:43,668 --> 01:07:47,205
- Hi.
- You gotta stop with this not answering the phone thing.

1571
01:07:47,606 --> 01:07:50,807
Look, Lauren asked me to do a pre-pitch
before the clients got here,

1572
01:07:50,809 --> 01:07:52,410
so I need your support.

1573
01:07:52,611 --> 01:07:54,310
Will you please be in the room?

1574
01:07:54,312 --> 01:07:55,380
<i>I need you there.</i>

1575
01:07:55,714 --> 01:07:56,982
I slept with Frank.

1576
01:07:57,282 --> 01:07:58,250
What?

1577
01:07:58,717 --> 01:08:00,819
I don't even know
how it happened.

1578
01:08:01,119 --> 01:08:05,891
I was vulnerable, and I was lonely.
And he was there.

1579
01:08:06,524 --> 01:08:09,961
I just told him to leave. Oh, my God.
I don't ever want to see him again.

1580
01:08:10,262 --> 01:08:11,730
I don't even like him.

1581
01:08:11,997 --> 01:08:15,634
I mean, he's a recovering addict
and he's been to jail, and I...

1582
01:08:16,067 --> 01:08:17,636
What was I thinking?

1583
01:08:19,871 --> 01:08:21,172
Um...

1584
01:08:22,573 --> 01:08:24,042
I can't find my keys.

1585

Sometimes things,
they drop in between here.

1586
01:08:33,785 --> 01:08:36,288
You know, I know how much
you like my coffee and...

1587
01:08:36,922 --> 01:08:39,756
I don't wanna lose a customer,
so... well, what I mean is

1588
01:08:39,758 --> 01:08:41,556
you don't have to feel weird
or some kind of way

1589
01:08:41,558 --> 01:08:43,494
about coming into
the coffee shop. I get it.

1590
01:08:43,795 --> 01:08:46,463
I ain't your type.
I just wanted to say that.

- <i>Yep.</i>

1594

Damn.

"The List.
It's what you make it."

1596
01:09:12,456 --> 01:09:13,557
That's it?

1597
01:09:14,125 --> 01:09:15,659
Okay. Well...

1598
01:09:16,027 --> 01:09:18,794
maybe I just gave this one
to the wrong team. I'm sorry,

1599
01:09:18,796 --> 01:09:20,196
The clients
are coming back next week,

1600
01:09:20,198 --> 01:09:21,697
and rather than
making the mistake

1601
01:09:21,699 --> 01:09:23,166
of letting you
pitch on the fly,

1602
01:09:23,168 --> 01:09:24,633
I want to hear
what you've come up with,

1603
01:09:24,635 --> 01:09:26,271
and that was it?

1604

[Danica] "The List.

1605

It's one you make
for what you want,

and one you make
for what you don't.

Either way,

All right,
get to work on it right away.

1610
01:09:41,752 --> 01:09:44,555
Danica, you're not
out of the woods yet.

1611

[Lauren] Whoo!

1612
01:09:50,928 --> 01:09:52,896
- Okay, guys. Let's get to work on that.
- Yep, great.

1613
01:09:57,634 --> 01:10:00,168
- Bitch!
- I'm sorry.

1614
01:10:00,170 --> 01:10:04,274
Sorry for what? You saved me. And
where the hell did that come from?

1615
01:10:04,508 --> 01:10:09,311
[sighs] Someone said that to me.
In so many words.

1616
01:10:09,313 --> 01:10:10,581
And you couldn't tell me?

1617
01:10:10,914 --> 01:10:12,948
Look, that's amazing.

1618
01:10:12,950 --> 01:10:15,519
- All right, let's get this ad done.
- Yes.

1619
01:10:15,753 --> 01:10:19,890
And, uh, whoever told you that,
you owe them.

1620
01:10:20,224 --> 01:10:22,092
Yeah, I do.

1621
01:10:23,260 --> 01:10:25,629
So, can you add it
right there? Thank you.

1622
01:10:27,164 --> 01:10:29,767
So, we never talked
about the sex.

1623
01:10:32,703 --> 01:10:34,905
- Can you hear me?
- [keyboard clicking]

1624

[sighs] Yeah.

01:10:38,142 --> 01:10:42,279
He was really, really good.
And huge.

1626
01:10:43,579 --> 01:10:45,013
- [Kalli] What?
- [mouthing] Huge.

1627
01:10:45,015 --> 01:10:47,217
No, you have to do it again.

1628
01:10:47,518 --> 01:10:49,885
- Mmm... no.
- Yeah.

1629
01:10:49,887 --> 01:10:52,287
Yeah, you do, because
you're in pain right now.

1630
01:10:52,289 --> 01:10:55,325
Okay, you have to do it again
when you feel better,

1631
01:10:55,558 --> 01:10:57,758
so you know
it was really that good.

1632
01:10:57,760 --> 01:10:59,662
I don't wanna lead him on,
because...

1633
01:11:00,464 --> 01:11:02,197
I mean, I'm not interested
in him at all.

1634
01:11:02,199 --> 01:11:05,835
I didn't say lead him on.
I said fuck him.

1635
01:11:07,337 --> 01:11:11,175
- When I was on drugs, when I was drinking...
- [door opens]

1636
01:11:12,376 --> 01:11:15,843
uh, I was out of my mind,
I was out of control.

1637
01:11:15,845 --> 01:11:17,247
I didn't know better.

1638
01:11:18,248 --> 01:11:20,282
But it's obvious to me
that you guys know better.

1639
01:11:20,284 --> 01:11:21,784
Otherwise you wouldn't
be here, right?

1640
01:11:22,086 --> 01:11:23,951
You can do better.
You can beat the system.

1641
01:11:23,953 --> 01:11:26,188
If you beat the system first,
it can never beat you.

1642
01:11:26,190 --> 01:11:27,191
Simple as that.

1643
01:11:28,258 --> 01:11:30,827

She just does that so we can talk.

Well, you know, your sister.

1655
01:12:03,960 --> 01:12:06,428
- I need to thank you for something.
- Okay.

1656
01:12:06,430 --> 01:12:10,030
You said something to me in our
talk and I used it in a meeting.

1657
01:12:10,032 --> 01:12:11,767
It went over really well.

1658
01:12:12,469 --> 01:12:15,805
What you said about living
to love another day.

1659
01:12:17,541 --> 01:12:18,674
Great.

1660
01:12:20,577 --> 01:12:22,209
Do you wanna go grab a drink,

1661
01:12:22,211 --> 01:12:24,747
or something,
to celebrate with me?

1662
01:12:25,448 --> 01:12:26,415
Or water.

1663
01:12:27,618 --> 01:12:29,218
I'm gonna pass, Danica.

1664
01:12:30,753 --> 01:12:32,755
- Oh. Okay.
- Take care.

1665
01:12:34,757 --> 01:12:37,126
Girl, you offered a
recovering alcoholic a drink?

1666
01:12:37,460 --> 01:12:39,460
- Is that good for him?
- [Danica] <i>Yes.</i>

1667
01:12:39,462 --> 01:12:41,130
No. Water.

1668
01:12:41,864 --> 01:12:44,198
[sighs] But, you know,
he was different.

1669
01:12:44,200 --> 01:12:46,000
- Yeah, well, he heard what you said.
- <i>I know.</i>

1670
01:12:46,002 --> 01:12:47,401
<i>That's not what I mean.</i>

1671
01:12:47,403 --> 01:12:49,704
He was talking
to these prisoners.

1672
01:12:50,506 --> 01:12:52,907
I just saw him differently,
I don't know.

1673
01:12:52,909 --> 01:12:55,478
- Girl, I can't with you.
- <i>What?</i>

1674
01:12:55,845 --> 01:12:57,578
You find out the man can screw

1675
01:12:57,580 --> 01:12:58,915
<i>and now he's looking good.</i>

1676
01:12:59,382 --> 01:13:01,415
- You're talking to me?
- <i>Girl, look,</i>

1677
01:13:01,417 --> 01:13:04,618
he was crazy about you before.
Make him crazy about you again.

1678
01:13:04,620 --> 01:13:05,986
Maybe he didn't enjoy me.

1679
01:13:05,988 --> 01:13:07,488
<i>Well, then
you have to prove to him</i>

1680
01:13:07,490 --> 01:13:08,491
<i>that you're that good.</i>

1681
01:13:09,058 --> 01:13:10,927
- I'll see you in the morning.
- <i>Goodnight.</i>

1682
01:13:30,779 --> 01:13:32,248
[Tanya] Good morning.

1683
01:13:33,182 --> 01:13:34,083
Hi.

1684
01:13:35,151 --> 01:13:37,186
- Here's your coffee.
- Thank you.

1685
01:13:37,553 --> 01:13:38,588
Where's your money?

1686
01:13:39,422 --> 01:13:42,023
- Frank doesn't charge me.
- Oh, well, Frank isn't here.

1687
01:13:43,526 --> 01:13:45,927
Well, where is he?
I mean, he's always here.

1688
01:13:46,395 --> 01:13:48,861
Why? You don't like him,
remember?

1689
01:13:48,863 --> 01:13:50,466
He told me
what you said about him.

1690
01:13:51,234 --> 01:13:52,832
But let me just be honest
with you, okay?

1691
01:13:52,834 --> 01:13:53,967
You know that girl
I was telling you

1692
01:13:53,969 --> 01:13:55,502
that come in here all the time?

1693
01:13:55,504 --> 01:13:57,340
Well, he took her
to breakfast this morning.

1694
01:13:58,873 --> 01:14:00,610
That's good. Mmm.

1695
01:14:01,410 --> 01:14:03,845
Girl, you know
you are not happy about that.

1696
01:14:04,714 --> 01:14:08,047
[scoffs] Tanya, listen. I just
come here for the coffee.

1697
01:14:08,049 --> 01:14:10,852
And the sausage.
I know you two were doing it.

1698
01:14:11,286 --> 01:14:13,853
- Did he tell you that?
- No, but you just did.

1699
01:14:13,855 --> 01:14:16,189
Ooh, tell me everything.
Is he circumcised?

1700
01:14:16,191 --> 01:14:17,959
Do he got that turtleneck
where it be like...

1701
01:14:18,628 --> 01:14:19,995
[muffled] Hello.

1702
01:14:20,563 --> 01:14:21,631
Um...

1703
01:14:22,264 --> 01:14:25,000
- Tell me everything.
- We didn't. We didn't.

1704
01:14:25,934 --> 01:14:28,103
- Girl. Okay.
- Bye, Tanya.

1705
01:14:28,336 --> 01:14:29,170
I got you.

1706
01:14:29,639 --> 01:14:33,006
Oh, Frank. Danica didn't
pay for her coffee.

1707
01:14:33,008 --> 01:14:35,176
Uh, that's...
That's okay, Tanya.

1708
01:14:35,377 --> 01:14:36,209
Danica.

1709
01:14:36,211 --> 01:14:37,678
Mama didn't name you that.

1710
01:14:37,680 --> 01:14:39,147
She named you Danica.

1711
01:14:40,882 --> 01:14:43,018
- I need to get in here and help your sis...
- Just...

1712
01:14:44,654 --> 01:14:46,154
I need to say I was wrong

1713
01:14:46,454 --> 01:14:50,125
for saying the things
I said to my friend about you.

1714
01:14:50,892 --> 01:14:52,327
- Okay, thanks.
- No.

1715
01:14:52,927 --> 01:14:54,229
You're a good guy.

1716
01:14:55,363 --> 01:14:56,598
And I am so sorry.

1717
01:14:56,998 --> 01:14:58,033
I was wrong.

1718
01:14:58,300 --> 01:15:00,068
The way I treated you,
it was...

1719
01:15:02,404 --> 01:15:03,505
It was terrible.

1720
01:15:04,906 --> 01:15:06,174
And I mean...

1721
01:15:07,075 --> 01:15:08,343
I was going through a lot.

1722
01:15:09,177 --> 01:15:10,478
Can we just start over?

1723
01:15:10,979 --> 01:15:13,248
Take our time
and get to know each other.

1724
01:15:15,216 --> 01:15:17,552
[pop song playing]

1725
01:15:25,527 --> 01:15:27,495
[both panting]

1726
01:15:31,466 --> 01:15:32,500
It's real.

1727
01:15:35,936 --> 01:15:37,037
What?

1728
01:15:39,574 --> 01:15:41,276
Nothing. Nothing.

1729
01:15:44,679 --> 01:15:46,046
Can I tell you something?

1730
01:15:46,614 --> 01:15:47,682
Here it comes.

1731
01:15:48,015 --> 01:15:49,482
I'll save you the trouble.
I'll go.

1732
01:15:49,484 --> 01:15:50,452
No, no, no.

1733
01:15:51,952 --> 01:15:53,455
I don't want you
to leave tonight.

1734
01:15:55,089 --> 01:15:56,890
What about
your crazy-ass sister?

1735
01:15:57,625 --> 01:15:59,226
She won't hear you. Just...

1736
01:16:00,362 --> 01:16:01,193
be quiet.

1737
01:16:01,195 --> 01:16:02,762
She might not hear me,

1738
01:16:02,764 --> 01:16:04,499
but she's gonna hear
your loud ass.

1739
01:16:05,032 --> 01:16:06,466
Yes, I can.

1740
01:16:06,468 --> 01:16:08,835
I knew it,
I knew it, I knew it.

1741
01:16:08,837 --> 01:16:11,136
- Mm-mmm-mm.
- Tanya, get out.

1742
01:16:11,138 --> 01:16:14,072
Look at y'all. I'm gonna
need a cigarette after this.

1743
01:16:14,074 --> 01:16:15,941
Tanya, I locked the door.

1744
01:16:15,943 --> 01:16:18,210
Well, I pick locks
like you pick pussy.

1745
01:16:18,212 --> 01:16:20,212
- [laughing]
- Tanya!

1746
01:16:20,214 --> 01:16:22,484
[sustained squeal]

1747
01:16:23,651 --> 01:16:25,653
Well, and now she knows.

1748
01:16:25,953 --> 01:16:27,287
And now I better go.

1749
01:16:28,455 --> 01:16:29,489
Why?

1750
01:16:29,491 --> 01:16:31,256
I mean, I wanna stay
but, you know,

1751
01:16:31,258 --> 01:16:32,794
that does
something else for me.

1752
01:16:33,994 --> 01:16:37,496
- How?
- I like you a lot, Danica, you know that.

1753
01:16:37,498 --> 01:16:41,402
It's hard enough for me to sleep with
you without waking up looking at you.

1754
01:16:42,035 --> 01:16:43,570
Am I that bad in the morning?

1755
01:16:43,971 --> 01:16:44,873
No.

1756
01:16:45,239 --> 01:16:46,641
You're that beautiful.

1757
01:16:47,742 --> 01:16:49,510
But you're not into me.

1758
01:16:50,511 --> 01:16:53,681
So, I'm gonna protect my little
heart, and I'm gonna go.

1759
01:16:54,481 --> 01:16:55,416
You sure?

1760
01:16:56,383 --> 01:16:58,285
It's all good.
I know how you feel.

1761
01:17:00,053 --> 01:17:01,422
I didn't mean that.

1762
01:17:02,923 --> 01:17:04,324
Goodnight.

1763
01:17:10,564 --> 01:17:12,266
- [Kalli] He said that?
- [Danica] Yes.

1764
01:17:12,533 --> 01:17:14,835
- He's gay.
- He is not gay.

1765
01:17:15,369 --> 01:17:17,337
Well, then he's perfect.

1766
01:17:18,205 --> 01:17:19,906
But he only has a few things
on my list.

1767
01:17:19,908 --> 01:17:22,242
- Damn the list!
- Same thing I was thinking.

1768
01:17:23,177 --> 01:17:26,578
Well, if you don't want him, I'm
gonna start drinking all his coffee.

1769
01:17:26,580 --> 01:17:29,483
- I'll be at the Brown Bean in the morning.
- Girl, stop.

1770
01:17:30,317 --> 01:17:32,519
Seriously, you need
to seal this deal.

1771
01:17:33,754 --> 01:17:36,423
I never pictured my life
with a man like him.

1772
01:17:37,424 --> 01:17:40,227
Well, girl,
then paint another picture.

1773
01:17:40,661 --> 01:17:42,563
- Exactly.
- [laughs]

1774
01:17:44,832 --> 01:17:47,866
I have a little cabin up in
the mountains in Bear Creek,

1775
01:17:47,868 --> 01:17:50,970
and I would love for us
to go up one weekend.

1776
01:17:52,739 --> 01:17:53,874
I would like that.

1777
01:17:54,174 --> 01:17:55,307
I mean, you know,
it's nothing fancy,

1778
01:17:55,309 --> 01:17:56,708
but it's mine.

1779
01:17:56,710 --> 01:17:58,108
When I get stressed out,

1780
01:17:58,110 --> 01:17:59,746
I use it to get away, so...

1781
01:18:00,581 --> 01:18:02,449
I would like
to share it with you.

1782
01:18:04,150 --> 01:18:05,586
What's that look for?

1783
01:18:07,321 --> 01:18:08,822
I like you, Frank.

1784
01:18:09,255 --> 01:18:12,326
I do. Why...
why are you laughing?

1785
01:18:13,092 --> 01:18:17,397
Look, when you're in recovery, it's
really important that you don't...

1786
01:18:18,398 --> 01:18:21,298
I don't know, put yourself in
positions that will break you down.

1787
01:18:21,300 --> 01:18:23,535
I know I'm not the man
that you're looking for, so,

1788
01:18:23,537 --> 01:18:26,339
I figure why not just enjoy
the here and now.

1789
01:18:27,306 --> 01:18:29,075
I'm not gonna hurt you.

1790
01:18:29,710 --> 01:18:30,978
Yeah, okay.

You should rest.
Tanya can open the shop.

- Yeah.

1835
01:21:16,508 --> 01:21:19,210
- Sorry, sorry.
- It's okay. It's okay.

1836
01:21:22,848 --> 01:21:23,883
Hey.

1837
01:21:26,618 --> 01:21:29,055
- How are you?
- How are you?

1838
01:21:29,454 --> 01:21:32,089
I've been crazy.
There was a fire in the rig,

1839
01:21:32,091 --> 01:21:35,159
and this is gonna sound
like a lie, but it's not, okay?

1840
01:21:35,161 --> 01:21:36,926
The night I was supposed
to call you,

1841
01:21:36,928 --> 01:21:39,595
I lost my laptop, I lost my
phone, I lost all my contacts

1842
01:21:39,597 --> 01:21:41,230
which has been mayhem itself.

1843
01:21:41,232 --> 01:21:43,700
And then when I finally found
your email, it was changed.

1844
01:21:43,702 --> 01:21:47,639
So I reached out to everybody
that I thought may know you,

1845
01:21:48,206 --> 01:21:50,875
and I called
every ad agency in the city

1846
01:21:52,010 --> 01:21:53,411
asking for you.

1847
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:58,014
Well, that's been
three months now.

1848
01:21:58,016 --> 01:22:00,318
And I've been looking
for you ever since.

1849
01:22:02,188 --> 01:22:03,621
Charlie...

1850
01:22:04,389 --> 01:22:06,289
- What about that guy?
- Lawrence.

1851
01:22:06,291 --> 01:22:08,224
We were cool.
He was my college coach,

1852
01:22:08,226 --> 01:22:10,660
and it's embarrassing, but I had
really bad credit in college

1853
01:22:10,662 --> 01:22:12,895
and my phone
was in his name for years.

1854
01:22:12,897 --> 01:22:15,633
And he must've hacked my phone
and called you.

1855
01:22:16,534 --> 01:22:18,501
I don't know
why he would do that.

1856
01:22:18,503 --> 01:22:20,636
But I've been going crazy
not knowing where you were.

1857
01:22:20,638 --> 01:22:22,239
I'm so sorry, I just...

1858
01:22:22,707 --> 01:22:25,844
You look so beautiful in person.
I'm sorry, I just...

1859
01:22:26,578 --> 01:22:28,580
You know how much I love you
and I miss you?

1860
01:22:29,114 --> 01:22:30,582
We're soulmates, remember that?

1861
01:22:31,382 --> 01:22:34,751
Look, do we have
to have this conversation here?

1862
01:22:34,753 --> 01:22:37,088
Or can we maybe
go to lunch or something?

1863
01:22:37,489 --> 01:22:41,724
I'm sorry, but you're gonna have to
give me a second to take this all in.

1864
01:22:41,726 --> 01:22:44,026
Yeah, of course,
I totally get that.

1865
01:22:44,028 --> 01:22:46,229
Obviously you can see
that this is, um...

1866
01:22:46,231 --> 01:22:48,030
[clears throat]
this is hard for me.

1867
01:22:48,032 --> 01:22:49,565
But not to take away the fact

1868
01:22:49,567 --> 01:22:51,803
that this must be
confusing for you.

1869
01:22:52,369 --> 01:22:54,203
Um, look, I'm sorry
I just barged in here.

1870
01:22:54,205 --> 01:22:56,438
But I didn't know what else to do.
I just wanted to see you,

1871
01:22:56,440 --> 01:22:59,376
but these are my numbers.

1872
01:22:59,911 --> 01:23:01,378
So, if you wanna...

1873
01:23:02,346 --> 01:23:03,982
You know, just...

1874
01:23:09,254 --> 01:23:11,020
[sighs]

1875
01:23:11,022 --> 01:23:13,089
[knocking]

1876
01:23:13,091 --> 01:23:14,491
We closed.

1877
01:23:15,927 --> 01:23:17,661
- [knocking]
- [Kalli] Tanya.

1878
01:23:17,929 --> 01:23:20,362
What do you not understand
about "we closed"?

1879
01:23:20,364 --> 01:23:21,831
It's Kalli.

1880
01:23:21,833 --> 01:23:24,668
- So? We're closed.
- Girl, open the door.

1881
01:23:26,336 --> 01:23:27,272
Damn!

1882
01:23:28,006 --> 01:23:29,805
It's too late for you bitches
to be drinking coffee.

1883
01:23:29,807 --> 01:23:31,473
What the hell you want
coming in here

1884
01:23:31,475 --> 01:23:33,142
like Sofia
from <i>The Color Purple?</i>

1885
01:23:33,144 --> 01:23:34,378
Well, hey.

1886
01:23:35,213 --> 01:23:36,247
What?

1887
01:23:36,915 --> 01:23:39,083
- Did she tell you?
- Tell me what?

1888
01:23:39,416 --> 01:23:41,618
Girl, Charlie is real.

1889
01:23:42,086 --> 01:23:44,888
- Are you serious?
- Yes, and he's beautiful.

1890
01:23:45,290 --> 01:23:48,090
But it can't be him, because we
did our research and everything

1891
01:23:48,092 --> 01:23:49,258
and we shut that down.

1892
01:23:49,260 --> 01:23:51,194
No. The dude that you burned?

1893
01:23:51,196 --> 01:23:53,031
He was using his identity.

1894
01:23:53,231 --> 01:23:55,233
And he hacked his phone.

1895
01:23:55,933 --> 01:23:58,500
Man, she's dating Frank
right now.

1896
01:23:58,502 --> 01:24:02,205
And, look, the only reason I'm telling you
is because you need to look out for her.

1897
01:24:02,207 --> 01:24:04,374
Okay?
She's so confused and...

1898
01:24:05,843 --> 01:24:08,812
- Are you smoking weed?
- Yeah. I got a prescription.

1899
01:24:12,916 --> 01:24:15,986
What you typing with those
pretty little fingers, huh?

1900
01:24:18,222 --> 01:24:20,924
Mmm. I'm not in the mood.

1901
01:24:25,662 --> 01:24:28,165
- What's up? What's going on?
- [sighs]

1902
01:24:28,932 --> 01:24:31,969
I'm really stressed at work right now.
I'm gonna need a minute.

1903
01:24:35,505 --> 01:24:36,840
It's something else.

1904
01:24:37,941 --> 01:24:40,442
But you'll tell me
when you're ready, I guess.

1905
01:24:40,444 --> 01:24:41,845
It's nothing else.

1906
01:24:46,884 --> 01:24:48,384
Mm-hmm.

1907
01:24:53,523 --> 01:24:55,859
[woman on TV, indistinct]

1908
01:24:57,127 --> 01:24:58,326
[door shuts]

1909
01:24:58,328 --> 01:24:59,963
- You leaving?
- Yeah.

1910
01:25:00,564 --> 01:25:01,997
Why?

1911
01:25:01,999 --> 01:25:04,167
Ask your sister, Tanya.
I'll see you tomorrow.

1912
01:25:14,778 --> 01:25:16,644
Why didn't you tell me
that Charlie was real

1913
01:25:16,646 --> 01:25:18,348
and you was thinking
about seeing him?

1914
01:25:18,648 --> 01:25:20,384
[groans]
That damn Kalli.

1915
01:25:20,583 --> 01:25:21,785
Don't hurt Frank.

1916
01:25:22,286 --> 01:25:24,019
Okay, good night.

1917
01:25:24,021 --> 01:25:25,719
You know that man
can slip back into using

1918
01:25:25,721 --> 01:25:27,590
if he gets
his heart broke, Danica.

1919
01:25:31,929 --> 01:25:33,529
[sighs]

1920
01:25:34,597 --> 01:25:37,167
What the hell
is wrong with me? Shit.

1921
01:25:37,800 --> 01:25:41,972
I have this great guy
and I'm so confused.

1922
01:25:42,438 --> 01:25:44,306
Why did I call him
to take me to lunch?

1923
01:25:44,308 --> 01:25:46,241
Look, maybe you should
go out with him.

1924
01:25:46,243 --> 01:25:48,045
You know, just to see
if he's the one.

1925
01:25:48,278 --> 01:25:51,281
Just see him.
If not, you'll always wonder.

1926
01:25:51,948 --> 01:25:53,683
And it's just lunch, right?

1927
01:25:54,450 --> 01:25:57,620
- Right.
- There he is. Go.

1928
01:25:58,121 --> 01:25:59,156
Hey.

1929
01:25:59,389 --> 01:26:00,554
- Hi
- You ready?

1930
01:26:00,556 --> 01:26:01,691
Yeah.

1931
01:26:02,458 --> 01:26:03,559
Yeah.

1932
01:26:06,096 --> 01:26:08,163
Her name is Kalli,
right, or something?

1933
01:26:08,165 --> 01:26:09,732
It's Kalli, yeah.

1934
01:26:10,200 --> 01:26:13,636
- [Charlie] ...maybe not at all.
- [Danica] I mean, for you, never.

1935
01:26:14,537 --> 01:26:17,238
- I mean, you know.
- Oh, I know.

1936
01:26:17,240 --> 01:26:18,806
You started this thing.

1937
01:26:18,808 --> 01:26:21,475
- It's unbelievable. Too real.
- This is insane.

1938
01:26:21,477 --> 01:26:22,912
Yeah.

1939
01:26:24,680 --> 01:26:26,649
[cell phone vibrates]

1940
01:26:28,150 --> 01:26:29,752
You know
you're my soulmate, right?

1941
01:26:30,320 --> 01:26:32,088
[line ringing]

1942
01:26:32,888 --> 01:26:35,390
- Um... [clears throat]
- Who's that, soulmate?

1943
01:26:35,392 --> 01:26:37,658
- [both laughing]
- [Danica] Um...

1944
01:26:37,660 --> 01:26:40,162
Frank, just someone I know.

1945
01:26:40,696 --> 01:26:43,497
Okay, well, cool. The restaurant
is, uh, is just down the street.

1946
01:26:43,499 --> 01:26:44,934
"Just someone I know?" Huh?

1947
01:26:49,672 --> 01:26:51,407
Frank, um, Charlie.

1948
01:26:51,941 --> 01:26:53,707
- What's up, man?
- [laughs]

1949
01:26:53,709 --> 01:26:55,211
The one
that's been catfishing you?

1950
01:26:56,846 --> 01:26:58,214
Turns out he's real.

1951
01:26:59,048 --> 01:27:01,548
And your soulmate,
apparently. Great.

1952
01:27:01,550 --> 01:27:02,985
I'm just someone
you know, right?

1953
01:27:04,552 --> 01:27:05,819
- Frank...
- Fuck off.

1954
01:27:05,821 --> 01:27:07,154
Nice to meet you, soulmate.

1955
01:27:07,156 --> 01:27:08,956
- Nice to meet you too...
- Yeah.

1956
01:27:08,958 --> 01:27:10,226
Uh, Frank.

1957
01:27:11,927 --> 01:27:13,929
Does he have
an anger management problem?

1958
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:18,167
- Damn, girl. He was pissed.
- Yeah.

1959
01:27:18,734 --> 01:27:20,200
So, what are you gonna do?

1960
01:27:20,202 --> 01:27:22,705
I'm going to go out
with Charlie to see.

1961
01:27:23,072 --> 01:27:26,073
And if Frank can't understand
that, then too bad.

1962
01:27:26,075 --> 01:27:28,177
Men do this all the time.

1963
01:27:29,145 --> 01:27:30,277
That's true.

1964
01:27:30,279 --> 01:27:31,814
- Right.
- So...

1965
01:27:33,182 --> 01:27:34,216
What?

1966
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:38,254
You make me wanna get so high,
I can't feel my face!

1967
01:27:38,787 --> 01:27:41,522
You know I'm not sensitive, right?
You know that?

1968
01:27:41,524 --> 01:27:43,856
You just told me the other day
that you were sensitive.

1969
01:27:43,858 --> 01:27:45,292
Shut up, bitch!
I changed my mind.

1970
01:27:45,294 --> 01:27:47,229
Did that hurt your feelings?
I'm sorry.

1971
01:27:48,297 --> 01:27:49,631
He was crying.

1972
01:27:50,299 --> 01:27:52,598
Frank, you made him cry.

1973
01:27:52,600 --> 01:27:54,901
Well, I... I'm sorry.

1974
01:27:54,903 --> 01:27:57,839
Well, I felt so bad for him,
I had to go ahead and fuck him.

1975
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:03,177
- What?
- I fucked him.

1976
01:28:03,179 --> 01:28:04,344
Good, too.

1977
01:28:04,346 --> 01:28:06,180
You slept
with your sister's man?

1978
01:28:06,182 --> 01:28:09,518
Yep, and we moving in together.
Where's his stuff?

1979
01:28:09,951 --> 01:28:12,687
You know what,
get it and get out.

1980
01:28:13,422 --> 01:28:15,855
I know you not mad while you
standing there dressed up

1981
01:28:15,857 --> 01:28:17,926
to go out
with that other nigga.

1982
01:28:18,294 --> 01:28:19,328
Slut.

1983
01:28:20,628 --> 01:28:21,828
"Slut."

1984
01:28:21,830 --> 01:28:23,865
- Yep, you a slut.
- [scoffs]

1985
01:28:24,599 --> 01:28:27,934
[Charlie] So, the igniter fluid was sludge.
It was crazy.

1986
01:28:27,936 --> 01:28:30,136
- [Danica] Mmm.
- [laughs]

1987
01:28:30,138 --> 01:28:32,272
- That sounds terrible.
- It was, it was.

1988
01:28:32,274 --> 01:28:33,940
Which... I guess
you had to be there.

1989
01:28:33,942 --> 01:28:35,342
But being an engineer,
I had to be there.

1990
01:28:35,344 --> 01:28:36,676
You know what I mean?

1991
01:28:36,678 --> 01:28:38,345
So, like, I could've
come home earlier,

1992
01:28:38,347 --> 01:28:39,979
but I'm important.

1993
01:28:39,981 --> 01:28:42,984
I was like the Steph Curry
of oil rig engineering.

1994
01:28:45,153 --> 01:28:46,321
Okay.

1995
01:28:46,589 --> 01:28:47,987
You know what, I'm sorry.

1996
01:28:47,989 --> 01:28:49,889
I just keep
talking about myself.

1997
01:28:49,891 --> 01:28:51,157
There's so much to talk about.

1998
01:28:51,159 --> 01:28:54,028
But how are you?
How is your job?

1999
01:28:54,629 --> 01:28:56,229
- It's good. Mm-hmm.
- Yeah?

2000
01:28:56,231 --> 01:28:59,500
It's good. I had this big
client the other day...

2001
01:28:59,502 --> 01:29:02,201
A big client's good. Hey,
excuse me, waiter. Excuse me.

2002
01:29:02,203 --> 01:29:04,337
Can we get another round here,
please. Thank you.

2003
01:29:04,339 --> 01:29:07,073
This décor is just...
I mean, the plates,

2004
01:29:07,075 --> 01:29:08,609
- they're great on the wall.
- Yeah.

2005
01:29:08,611 --> 01:29:10,943
I mean, I don't even know
what to do with...

2006
01:29:10,945 --> 01:29:12,615
I'm used to my sea legs,
you know what I mean?

2007
01:29:12,947 --> 01:29:15,014
- Yeah. Yeah, I'm sure.
- Yeah. Okay.

2008
01:29:15,016 --> 01:29:16,916
I'll just... I'll just take this.
Thank you.

2009
01:29:16,918 --> 01:29:19,952
Oh, okay. Yeah, well...
[clears throat]

2010
01:29:19,954 --> 01:29:23,856
Um, sir, I'm sorry.
But can I have a few shots?

2011
01:29:23,858 --> 01:29:25,725
[gasps] Ho ho!

2012
01:29:25,727 --> 01:29:27,994
- Shots, okay. Shots for the lady.
- Any type of vodka.

2013
01:29:27,996 --> 01:29:30,098
Shots for the lady.
She's ready to party.

2014
01:29:30,498 --> 01:29:32,834
Um... shots?
Oh. Okay.

2015
01:29:33,568 --> 01:29:36,135
- All right. That's how you do that.
- I wasn't ready,

2016
01:29:36,137 --> 01:29:38,004
- but, cheers.
- Okay. Yeah, well, cheers to you.

2017
01:29:38,006 --> 01:29:39,639
To the health.
To all the health.

2018
01:29:39,641 --> 01:29:41,809
[laughs] Shots?

2019
01:29:48,149 --> 01:29:50,049
Obviously everybody thought
I was gonna go pro.

2020
01:29:50,051 --> 01:29:52,485
- I mean, I was so good.
- [laughs]

2021
01:29:52,487 --> 01:29:55,188
But then I got injured.
It was this freak injury.

2022
01:29:55,190 --> 01:29:57,256
Pencil in the penis.
You know how it goes.

2023
01:29:57,258 --> 01:29:59,292
Sometimes I lose feeling
below the waist.

2024
01:29:59,294 --> 01:30:01,661
[clears throat] But... A
little tingling sensation.

2025
01:30:01,663 --> 01:30:04,963
But I've, um, you know, done a lot of
rehab on it. I got it under control.

2026
01:30:04,965 --> 01:30:07,732
So, I went to this, uh,
earth therapy for that.

2027
01:30:07,734 --> 01:30:10,936
And they told me, you know,
just bring the motherland in.

2028
01:30:10,938 --> 01:30:12,704
Do... Do African chants,

2029
01:30:12,706 --> 01:30:15,974
and, you know, then there's...
then the tingling subsides.

2030
01:30:15,976 --> 01:30:18,511
So, it's just, uh...
[rhythmic chanting]

2031
01:30:18,513 --> 01:30:20,812
You know, like, you know, just
gotta bring the ancestors back.

2032
01:30:20,814 --> 01:30:21,913
You know, from the ground up.

2033
01:30:21,915 --> 01:30:24,250
[laughing] Hey...

2034
01:30:24,252 --> 01:30:26,654
Get with it. Here you go.
I think I had enough already.

2035
01:30:26,887 --> 01:30:30,157
So... You ain't gotta do it with
that glass, baby. I got this.

2036
01:30:30,625 --> 01:30:31,992
You like to spit, huh?

2037
01:30:32,393 --> 01:30:34,194
Okay, uh...

2038
01:30:34,429 --> 01:30:36,228
Can we go now?

2039
01:30:36,230 --> 01:30:38,698
I put the "D" in ready.

2040
01:30:38,700 --> 01:30:41,436
[kissing and grunting]

2041
01:30:43,003 --> 01:30:44,505
[Charlie] Damn,
you got a hard-ass head.

2042
01:30:45,072 --> 01:30:46,137
[Danica] What?

2043
01:30:46,139 --> 01:30:47,640
Yes, baby. Uh-huh.

2044
01:30:47,642 --> 01:30:49,611
Oh, yeah.
Now's when we got liftoff now.

2045
01:30:50,344 --> 01:30:53,412
- Yeah? Okay.
- Oh, yes. Oh, yes. Oh, yes.

2046
01:30:53,414 --> 01:30:54,813
- Come on, come here, yeah.
- Yeah, okay.

2047
01:30:54,815 --> 01:30:56,083
Let's just make out.

2048
01:30:56,817 --> 01:30:59,317
[loud moaning]

2049
01:30:59,319 --> 01:31:01,721
Come, Papa Bear, up in that cave.
[grunts]

2050
01:31:01,723 --> 01:31:04,657
- Um... Oh, God.
- Yes! Welcome to the jungle!

2051
01:31:04,659 --> 01:31:06,891
Welcome to the...
[loud groaning]

2052
01:31:06,893 --> 01:31:08,927
[rhythmic chanting]

2053
01:31:08,929 --> 01:31:11,965
[high-pitched grunts]

2054
01:31:12,232 --> 01:31:15,400
- [chanting]
- Oh!

2055
01:31:15,402 --> 01:31:17,569
[exhales] Whoo!

2056
01:31:17,571 --> 01:31:19,439
[humming]

2057
01:31:19,906 --> 01:31:21,541
You remind me of my mama.

2058
01:31:22,276 --> 01:31:24,646
- That's weird.
- No, it's a beautiful thing.

2059
01:31:24,845 --> 01:31:25,946
Wait.

2060
01:31:27,481 --> 01:31:28,515
Oh, God.

2061
01:31:30,484 --> 01:31:32,185
[grunts] Oh, God.

2062
01:31:34,254 --> 01:31:35,455
Oh...

2063
01:31:35,757 --> 01:31:36,990
All right.

2064
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:39,826
- Um...
- [Charlie] Whoo!

2065
01:31:40,527 --> 01:31:41,626
Okay.

2066
01:31:41,628 --> 01:31:43,397
[exhales] Mmm.

2067
01:31:44,164 --> 01:31:46,431
- All right. [groans]
- [water running]

2068
01:31:46,433 --> 01:31:48,001
That was, uh...

2069
01:31:48,368 --> 01:31:49,403
something.

2070
01:31:54,675 --> 01:31:55,806
All right, seven minutes.

2071
01:31:55,808 --> 01:31:57,411
Who is seven minutes?

2072
01:31:58,578 --> 01:31:59,613
The Uber.

2073
01:32:00,314 --> 01:32:02,915
What?
You called me an Uber?

2074
01:32:03,450 --> 01:32:05,383
Well, UberPOOL.

2075
01:32:05,385 --> 01:32:08,119
That way I save some money,
you make some new friends.

2076
01:32:08,121 --> 01:32:10,424
- Everybody wins.
- Thank you.

2077
01:32:11,725 --> 01:32:13,591
- You're welcome.
- No, really, thank you.

2078
01:32:13,593 --> 01:32:15,429
Don't mention it.
Want me to walk you downstairs?

2079
01:32:15,762 --> 01:32:19,965
Um... nope, I got it.
Let me grab my purse.

2080
01:32:20,701 --> 01:32:21,867
Uh...

2081
01:32:22,602 --> 01:32:26,173
Yup. Thanks, Charlie.
Thank you so...

2082
01:32:26,606 --> 01:32:28,239
Thank you.

2083
01:32:28,241 --> 01:32:29,973
I mean, we got seven, you got,
like, seven minutes to do...

2084
01:32:29,975 --> 01:32:32,312
- No, thank you very much.
- We can get, like, two or three in.

2085
01:32:34,947 --> 01:32:36,383
[door opens]

2086
01:32:37,651 --> 01:32:40,119
[Kalli] <i>Wait,
did you have sex with him?</i>

2087
01:32:40,853 --> 01:32:42,019
He thinks we did.

2088
01:32:42,021 --> 01:32:43,822
Uh, what does that mean?

2089
01:32:43,824 --> 01:32:47,659
Well, I was only gonna make out
with him because I'm so confused.

2090
01:32:47,661 --> 01:32:52,697
And, well, we were making out
and he thinks we had sex.

2091
01:32:52,699 --> 01:32:54,066
Wait a minute. Wait.

2092
01:32:54,368 --> 01:32:56,368
How does he think that
and not know it?

2093
01:32:56,370 --> 01:32:58,936
He was having sex
with my inner thighs.

2094
01:32:58,938 --> 01:33:01,974
[Kalli laughing]

2095
01:33:03,610 --> 01:33:05,911
Kalli. Kalli. Kalli!

2096
01:33:06,546 --> 01:33:08,447
- It's not that funny.
- <i>Wait, wait, wait.</i>

2097
01:33:08,682 --> 01:33:12,717
Didn't you say he called you an Uber too?
[laughing]

2098
01:33:12,719 --> 01:33:13,787
Ka... Okay.

2099
01:33:14,186 --> 01:33:15,689
I'm getting off the phone now.

2100
01:33:16,155 --> 01:33:18,155
Whoo! That's what you wanted
on your list, girl.

2101
01:33:18,157 --> 01:33:20,190
[laughing]

2102
01:33:20,192 --> 01:33:22,962
- I'll call you back.
- <i>I'm sorry.</i>

2103
01:33:24,765 --> 01:33:25,799
Hi.

2104
01:33:26,899 --> 01:33:30,503
- I didn't know you were here.
- Yeah, I'm just grabbing my things.

2105
01:33:31,437 --> 01:33:33,036
Well, I'm glad you are.
I wanna talk to you.

2106
01:33:33,038 --> 01:33:34,505
I got nothing
to say to you, Danica.

2107
01:33:34,507 --> 01:33:35,906
[Tanya]
That's right, we ain't got

2108
01:33:35,908 --> 01:33:37,510
a damn thing to say to you.

2109
01:33:40,179 --> 01:33:41,748
You have every right
to be upset.

2110
01:33:42,248 --> 01:33:44,948
- But so do I.
- So do you? What did I do?

2111
01:33:44,950 --> 01:33:46,250
You slept with my sister.

2112
01:33:46,252 --> 01:33:48,185
- What?
- You heard me.

2113
01:33:48,187 --> 01:33:50,354
No, I didn't. What?

2114
01:33:50,356 --> 01:33:52,558
- Tanya.
- Yes, you touched me. You did.

2115
01:33:52,859 --> 01:33:54,059
Tanya.

2116
01:33:54,527 --> 01:33:55,561
Okay, I'm lying.

2117
01:33:56,162 --> 01:33:57,896
I would never sleep
with your sister.

2118
01:33:57,898 --> 01:33:59,463
What the hell
is wrong with me?

2119
01:33:59,465 --> 01:34:01,267
Tanya, 'cause I'm in love
with your sister.

2120
01:34:02,101 --> 01:34:03,335
In love?

2121
01:34:04,103 --> 01:34:05,604
Yeah,
and I'm a damn fool for it.

2122
01:34:07,173 --> 01:34:09,708
No, you're not a fool.
I'm the fool.

2123
01:34:10,409 --> 01:34:12,211
I was confused and...

2124
01:34:12,845 --> 01:34:13,913
Try to understand,

2125
01:34:14,180 --> 01:34:16,180
this guy was my dream guy.

2126
01:34:16,182 --> 01:34:18,083
He had everything on my list.

2127
01:34:18,584 --> 01:34:19,618
And you...

2128
01:34:20,119 --> 01:34:22,954
- you just came out of nowhere.
- Yup.

2129
01:34:23,222 --> 01:34:24,857
I have nothing
on your list, right?

2130
01:34:25,257 --> 01:34:27,126
Look, I get it.
I'm not your dream dude.

2131
01:34:27,526 --> 01:34:29,495
I'm a little rough
around the edges, right?

2132
01:34:31,230 --> 01:34:32,264
But you know what?

2133
01:34:32,898 --> 01:34:36,469
I've worked my ass off,
Danica, to get on my feet.

2134
01:34:37,203 --> 01:34:39,872
To have a spot,
a... a place on this Earth.

2135
01:34:41,005 --> 01:34:44,475
I've fought through a lot of shit,
and I've done a lot of shit.

2136
01:34:44,477 --> 01:34:47,344
But I'll tell you this:
one thing I would never do

2137
01:34:47,346 --> 01:34:51,013
is get fucked over by some girl
I was just trying to love.

2138
01:34:51,015 --> 01:34:52,449
I'm a good dude. You get that?

2139
01:34:52,451 --> 01:34:54,685
And I don't deserve
to be treated like this.

2140
01:34:54,687 --> 01:34:57,153
So if you can't handle
what I got to give,

2141
01:34:57,155 --> 01:34:58,990
then go be
with your list dude.

2142
01:34:59,391 --> 01:35:01,658
Don't cry, Frank, 'cause if
you start crying I'm gonna...

2143
01:35:01,660 --> 01:35:04,195
- Tanya!
- [Danica] Frank...

2144
01:35:04,930 --> 01:35:06,164
- I'm sorry.
- Danica,

2145
01:35:06,732 --> 01:35:07,766
can I go?

2146
01:35:08,399 --> 01:35:10,301
'Cause I really don't ever
wanna see your face again.

2147
01:35:13,472 --> 01:35:15,206
But you just said
you loved me.

2148
01:35:18,243 --> 01:35:20,546
And that's supposed to make me
wanna be with you?

2149
01:35:21,981 --> 01:35:23,214
That ain't enough.

2150
01:35:25,049 --> 01:35:26,451
Bye, Tanya.

2151
01:35:26,952 --> 01:35:29,554
[door opens and shuts]

2152
01:35:31,155 --> 01:35:32,689
[Tanya] Don't look at me.

2153
01:35:32,691 --> 01:35:35,157
'Cause if he would have
even smiled in my direction,

2154
01:35:35,159 --> 01:35:36,292
I would have fucked him.

2155
01:35:36,294 --> 01:35:38,060
And I would have got pregnant.

2156
01:35:38,062 --> 01:35:41,466
And I would have had me a little
coffee Brown Bean baby, okay?

2157
01:35:42,300 --> 01:35:47,405
Oh, I told Mama everything and she said she
wanna see us in Jersey in the morning.

2158
01:35:52,544 --> 01:35:53,745
Hi, girls.

2159
01:35:53,979 --> 01:35:56,847
- [Tanya] Hey, Mama.
- I love y'all, come on in.

2160
01:35:56,849 --> 01:36:00,017
[Danica] <i>Okay, so we were having this
debate about the list you made for Daddy.</i>

2161
01:36:00,019 --> 01:36:01,419
<i>Can we see it?</i>

2162
01:36:01,653 --> 01:36:03,352
Are you talking about
that list I told you about,

2163
01:36:03,354 --> 01:36:04,722
like, 20 years ago?

2164
01:36:05,590 --> 01:36:06,892
Yeah, that one.

2165
01:36:07,625 --> 01:36:10,159
- I lost it.
- I told you.

2166
01:36:10,161 --> 01:36:13,498
Mama, did you lie to me
about this list?

2169
01:36:19,370 --> 01:36:21,606
What about my dad?

2170
01:36:21,873 --> 01:36:24,342
I don't know that motherfucker.
I'm not sure.

2171
01:36:24,609 --> 01:36:27,209
It could have been any number
of really good people.

2172
01:36:27,211 --> 01:36:28,313
So you lied.

2173
01:36:28,913 --> 01:36:32,450
- When?
- When you told me about Daddy's list.

2174
01:36:33,284 --> 01:36:35,351
I made a list. It just...

2175
01:36:35,353 --> 01:36:39,221
I've never met anyone who got
everything they wanted in one person.

2176
01:36:39,223 --> 01:36:43,861
Sure, in the beginning, it feels like it...
it could be magnificent.

2177
01:36:44,062 --> 01:36:47,363
And then you start to see, well,
they got a couple little flaws.

2178
01:36:47,365 --> 01:36:49,534
You know? And that's okay.

2179
01:36:49,968 --> 01:36:53,571
Because in the real world
all you can do is hope to live

2180
01:36:53,905 --> 01:36:59,377
with the little tiny perfections you find
in the very flawed people you come across.

2181
01:37:00,143 --> 01:37:02,447

And I was foolish
for chasing what was a dream.

2186
01:37:45,222 --> 01:37:46,758
I know you're not perfect.

2187
01:37:47,759 --> 01:37:48,958
Neither am I.

2188
01:37:48,960 --> 01:37:51,662
But we can be
imperfect together.

2189
01:37:54,832 --> 01:37:57,567
[sighs] I know you don't
wanna talk to me right now.

2190
01:37:58,069 --> 01:38:01,338
But I'm gonna stand out here
and hope that you come and talk.

2191

Even if it takes all night.

2192
01:38:03,707 --> 01:38:06,243

So, if that means making
a fool of myself again...

2198
01:38:30,333 --> 01:38:31,568
well, then I will.

2199
01:38:34,438 --> 01:38:35,472
