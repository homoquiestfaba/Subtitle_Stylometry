How did you know that?

175
00:10:43,200 --> 00:10:45,920
-Just did.
-Bloody hell, he's good, right?

176
00:10:46,400 --> 00:10:50,960
Anyway, let's get down to business.
Stefan's got something to demo for us.

177
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:55,360
[Stefan] You choose with the joystick.
See. You've got ten seconds.

178
00:10:55,960 --> 00:10:57,760
Don't worship him,
he's the Thief of Destiny.

179
00:10:58,400 --> 00:11:01,360
-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

180
00:11:01,440 --> 00:11:03,920
Isn't he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

181
00:11:04,400 --> 00:11:06,160
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

182
00:11:06,240 --> 00:11:08,760
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

183
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:10,360
-All of them.
-Excuse me.

184
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,560
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

185
00:11:17,640 --> 00:11:19,920
Right. So a lot of paths then?

186
00:11:20,400 --> 00:11:22,520
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

187
00:11:22,600 --> 00:11:24,320
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

188
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:28,480
It was ahead of its time.
In as much as time exists.

189
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:32,040
OK. So here's my proposal.

190
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,720
Come and write it here.

191
00:11:34,840 --> 00:11:36,680
-Here?
-We'll give you a couple of desks,

192
00:11:36,760 --> 00:11:39,600

And of course Col's on hand.

193
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:41,440

194
00:11:42,840 --> 00:11:45,040
Oh, and hey,
I'm hiring this sound chip guy next week,

195
00:11:45,120 --> 00:11:47,440
so music we can take care of.
All in-house.

196
00:11:47,760 --> 00:11:50,200
So, come on. What's your answer?

197
00:11:52,960 --> 00:11:53,960
No.

198
00:12:00,200 --> 00:12:04,520
I mean, yes,
I want to do your game, but I-I just...

199
00:12:05,040 --> 00:12:06,400
I just think I need-I need to...

200
00:12:10,480 --> 00:12:13,800
I need to write it how I know.

201
00:12:14,960 --> 00:12:17,200
You know, just me. At home.

202
00:12:17,440 --> 00:12:19,560
At home. On your own?

203
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,480
Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

204
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:26,840
and I think if I let other people in
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

205
00:12:26,920 --> 00:12:28,440
"Stressy"?

206
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:34,240
But I know
that I can do it proper justice.

208
00:12:35,840 --> 00:12:39,280
You know, divergent story paths.
Parallel realities.

209
00:12:39,360 --> 00:12:42,040
-It's still a game though, yeah?
-I get it.

210
00:12:42,600 --> 00:12:44,000
The lad's a craftsman.

211

He's a lone woodsman. I'm the same.

212
00:12:46,840 --> 00:12:48,920
-Yeah, but...
-It's like I say,

213

teams are fine for things
like action titles,

214
00:12:51,600 --> 00:12:53,320
but when it's a concept piece,

215
00:12:54,200 --> 00:12:58,240
bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

216

to work on something like this?

260

I just said no

by saying that I prefer to work alone.

Perhaps you're feeling intruded upon
because of the anniversary looming.

It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

Would you like to talk about what
happened with your mother?

276

It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

506
00:36:39,680 --> 00:36:43,360
<i>If you follow that line of thinking</i>
<i>to its logical conclusion,</i>

507
00:36:43,440 --> 00:36:46,160
<i>then you're absolved of any guilt</i>
<i>from your actions.</i>

508
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:49,680
<i>But they're not even your actions.</i>

509
00:36:50,680 --> 00:36:51,920
<i>It's out of your control.</i>

510
00:36:54,280 --> 00:36:57,800
<i>Your fate has been dictated,</i>
<i>it's out of your hands.</i>

511
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:01,920
<i>So, why not commit murder?</i>

512
00:37:03,320 --> 00:37:04,640
<i>Maybe that's what destiny wants.</i>

513
00:37:06,120 --> 00:37:07,320
<i>You're just a puppet.</i>

514
00:37:08,920 --> 00:37:10,280
<i>You're not in control.</i>

515
00:37:54,600 --> 00:37:55,680
[mum] <i>Stefan?</i>

516
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,840
[mum] <i>Yes, and so what, Rabbit's a toy.</i>

517
00:38:53,920 --> 00:38:55,680
[dad]
<i>A baby's toy that he takes everywhere.</i>

518
00:38:55,760 --> 00:38:56,600
[mum] <i>He's five.</i>

519
00:38:56,680 --> 00:38:58,840
[dad] <i>And by five,</i>
<i>he should've stopped playing with dolls.</i>

520
00:38:58,920 --> 00:39:01,000
-[mum] <i>It's not a doll.</i>
-If he takes it to your parents,

521
00:39:01,080 --> 00:39:03,480
I'm going to have to withstand
another lecture from your dad

522
00:39:03,560 --> 00:39:05,600
-about permissive child-rearing.
-Oh, for God's sake.

523
00:39:05,680 --> 00:39:08,120
I'm sorry, look,
I am going to do something about this.

524
00:39:22,880 --> 00:39:23,840
-[door slams]
-[locking]

525
00:39:23,920 --> 00:39:26,040
[gasps]

526
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:44,280
[beeps]

527
00:40:14,600 --> 00:40:15,440
No!

528
00:40:19,040 --> 00:40:20,400
Who's doing this to me?

529
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:22,520
I know there's someone there.

530
00:40:24,400 --> 00:40:26,240
-Who's there?
-[high-pitched whirring]

531
00:40:26,440 --> 00:40:27,720
Who are you?

532
00:40:30,200 --> 00:40:32,080
Just give me a sign.

533
00:40:33,560 --> 00:40:36,000
Come on. If there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

534
00:40:36,080 --> 00:40:37,440
Will you give me a sign?

535
00:40:37,920 --> 00:40:41,280
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign.

536
00:40:44,600 --> 00:40:45,640
[beeps]

537
00:40:51,280 --> 00:40:52,600
Fucking hell.

538
00:40:57,960 --> 00:41:01,440
Who... What the fuck is Netflix?

539
00:41:08,640 --> 00:41:10,280
Seriously, what does that mean?

540
00:41:23,840 --> 00:41:26,880
I don't know what that means.

541
00:41:33,640 --> 00:41:36,760
You're not making any sense.
Can you make sense?

542
00:41:51,320 --> 00:41:53,440
I don't understand. I-I don't understand.

543
00:41:54,520 --> 00:41:55,640
[beeps]

544
00:41:55,880 --> 00:41:57,240
[dad] Who are you talking to?

545
00:41:58,960 --> 00:41:59,880
It'll sound crazy.

546
00:42:00,600 --> 00:42:02,240
Well, tell me anyway.

547
00:42:02,680 --> 00:42:04,600
I'm being controlled by someone
from the future.

548
00:42:09,040 --> 00:42:09,880
What?

549
00:42:10,480 --> 00:42:14,000
I'm being controlled
by someone from the future.

550
00:42:16,720 --> 00:42:19,600
-Shall I ring Dr. Haynes?
-Yes, please.

551
00:42:28,440 --> 00:42:33,160
So, you're being controlled
by someone on Netflix.

552
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:37,800
-What is Netflix? Is it a planet?
-I don't know, it...

553
00:42:38,160 --> 00:42:41,600
It's some sort
of future entertainment thing.

554
00:42:41,680 --> 00:42:44,280
-Like a computer game?
-I don't know.

555
00:42:45,840 --> 00:42:48,680
It's from the 21st Century, they said.

556
00:42:49,240 --> 00:42:52,400
OK, well,
let's try to pick it apart logically,

557
00:42:52,480 --> 00:42:56,160
to see if we can define
if this is reality or delusion.

558
00:42:56,440 --> 00:42:59,720
-It's not a delusion.
-OK, let's go through it.

559
00:43:01,120 --> 00:43:02,200
OK.

560
00:43:02,360 --> 00:43:08,120
So all of this is happening
to entertain someone.

561
00:43:08,400 --> 00:43:10,560
-Someone who's controlling you.
-Uh-huh.

562
00:43:12,280 --> 00:43:16,240
So why aren't you
in a more entertaining scenario?

563
00:43:18,880 --> 00:43:21,440
-What do you mean?
-Well, look at you.

564
00:43:21,960 --> 00:43:25,440
You're in a small ordinary room,
in an ordinary part of the world,

565
00:43:25,520 --> 00:43:27,480
talking to an ordinary woman.

566
00:43:28,960 --> 00:43:33,400
If this was entertainment,
surely you'd make it more interesting.

567
00:43:34,080 --> 00:43:36,320
Inject a little action, isn't that right?

568
00:43:38,160 --> 00:43:42,600
I mean, wouldn't you want
a little more action

569
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,440
if you were watching this now on telly?

570
00:43:57,160 --> 00:43:58,440
[screams]

571
00:44:02,240 --> 00:44:03,480
[grunts]

572
00:44:04,760 --> 00:44:09,480
Come at me. Come on, mummy's boy.
What are you waiting for?

573
00:44:16,920 --> 00:44:19,200
Come on. I dare you.

574
00:44:22,400 --> 00:44:25,240
-[woman] Cut!
-[alarm rings]

575
00:44:25,720 --> 00:44:29,080
Sorry, are you OK?

576
00:44:30,520 --> 00:44:31,640
[man] Two sugars.

577
00:44:34,800 --> 00:44:36,160
I-I was, er...

578
00:44:37,480 --> 00:44:38,640
Window.

579
00:44:39,520 --> 00:44:40,560
Window.

580
00:44:40,640 --> 00:44:42,920
I was trying to open the window.
To jump out.

581
00:44:44,240 --> 00:44:45,640
[woman] You don't jump out.

582
00:44:46,400 --> 00:44:48,120
You can't jump out. It doesn't open, look.

583
00:44:48,200 --> 00:44:51,400
You're not scripted to jump out,
see, Mike?

584
00:44:52,240 --> 00:44:53,920
It's the fight scene now.

585
00:44:57,920 --> 00:44:58,920
Mike?

586
00:45:01,440 --> 00:45:02,440
Mike?

587
00:45:03,760 --> 00:45:05,800
Er... Stefan.

588
00:45:08,120 --> 00:45:10,160
Do you want to sit down for a moment?

589
00:45:11,800 --> 00:45:14,120
Can we get the medic down here please?

590
00:45:22,560 --> 00:45:24,200
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

591
00:45:26,240 --> 00:45:28,520
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

592
00:45:30,280 --> 00:45:31,960
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

593
00:45:34,040 --> 00:45:36,280
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

594
00:45:38,120 --> 00:45:39,800
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

595
00:45:41,800 --> 00:45:44,000
<i>I'm concerned about you, OK?</i>

596
00:45:46,040 --> 00:45:47,680
<i>You need to speak to her.</i>

597
00:45:49,560 --> 00:45:50,560
<i>I'm concerned about...</i>

598
00:45:51,400 --> 00:45:52,680
["Relax" playing]

599
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:54,000
[music stops]

600
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:57,120
-Motown for computer games.
-[Stefan] Colin Ritman?

601
00:45:58,480 --> 00:46:00,200
-We've met before.
-What's your answer?

602
00:46:00,280 --> 00:46:01,600
Bit of madness is what you need.

603
00:46:02,360 --> 00:46:03,920
Stefan, will you talk to me?

604
00:46:04,000 --> 00:46:05,560
Dad, just fuck off!

605
00:46:06,560 --> 00:46:07,680
[dad] Get your coat.

606
00:46:08,680 --> 00:46:09,920
This is Dr. Haynes' place.

607
00:46:10,000 --> 00:46:11,640
You need to speak to her.

608
00:46:11,840 --> 00:46:13,080
You're under pressure.

609
00:46:14,000 --> 00:46:16,560
You're not sleeping, you're not eating.

610
00:46:21,160 --> 00:46:22,600
Stefan, come back.

611
00:46:23,360 --> 00:46:24,640
Stefan!

612
00:46:25,440 --> 00:46:26,440
[Stefan] Colin.

613
00:46:28,520 --> 00:46:29,360
Hi.

614
00:46:31,320 --> 00:46:33,200
How's Bandersnatch going?

615
00:46:34,280 --> 00:46:35,240
Not good.

616
00:46:36,080 --> 00:46:38,880
Not good. I'm just... lost.

617
00:46:40,560 --> 00:46:43,040
-You're in the hole.
-[Stefan] In the what?

618
00:46:43,120 --> 00:46:46,640
-[Colin] In a fight with your own head.
-Yes. That's exactly it.

619
00:46:47,520 --> 00:46:51,800
-You got anywhere to be later?
-Er, well, no.

620
00:46:53,360 --> 00:46:54,440
Come with me.

[door slams]

[door closes]

623
00:47:25,280 --> 00:47:27,120
Stefan, this is Kitty.

624
00:47:31,880 --> 00:47:33,160
And this is Pearl.

625
00:47:33,560 --> 00:47:34,640
[baby coos]

626
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:36,280
Daddy's little legacy.

627
00:47:40,000 --> 00:47:41,840
Stefan's in the hole, Kit.

628
00:47:43,320 --> 00:47:44,200
[Kitty] Poor thing.

629
00:47:45,880 --> 00:47:47,320
Are you going to get him out?

630
00:47:48,360 --> 00:47:49,360
Mm-hm.

631
00:48:04,720 --> 00:48:05,920
Grab a pew.

632
00:48:33,800 --> 00:48:34,760
Here.

633
00:48:36,360 --> 00:48:39,200
-[Stefan] Oh. I haven't ever really...
-[Colin] Come on.

634
00:48:56,120 --> 00:48:59,520
[coughs]

635
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:05,880
[Colin] You'll get the hang of that.

636
00:49:11,720 --> 00:49:12,600
[coughs]

637
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:16,320
[Colin] One for you...

638
00:49:16,720 --> 00:49:17,960
One for me.

639
00:49:19,960 --> 00:49:23,200
-What is it?
-It lets you see the bigger picture.

640
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:27,720
-I-I don't know.
-It'll help you understand.

641
00:49:29,360 --> 00:49:30,480
Do you want it?

642
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,000
It's your choice.

643
00:49:35,640 --> 00:49:38,400
Totally up to you. Don't feel pressured.

644
00:49:47,400 --> 00:49:48,360
Yes.

645
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:57,440
[Colin] Do this.

646
00:50:17,840 --> 00:50:18,680
Now what?

647
00:50:19,880 --> 00:50:21,440
Now we just wait a bit.

648
00:50:27,680 --> 00:50:31,040
[gentle music plays]

649
00:50:46,200 --> 00:50:47,360
[chuckles]

650
00:50:50,520 --> 00:50:52,080
[laughs]

651
00:50:54,120 --> 00:50:57,000
[laughs]

652
00:51:08,040 --> 00:51:11,040
[blows]

653
00:51:17,640 --> 00:51:19,360
[Colin] People think there's one reality

654
00:51:19,440 --> 00:51:21,720
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

655
00:51:21,800 --> 00:51:24,440
And what we do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

656
00:51:24,520 --> 00:51:26,320
Time is a construct.

657
00:51:26,440 --> 00:51:28,200
People think you can't go back
and change things,

658
00:51:28,640 --> 00:51:30,920
but you can, that's what flashbacks are,

659
00:51:31,040 --> 00:51:33,840
they're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

660
00:51:33,920 --> 00:51:36,960
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

661
00:51:37,040 --> 00:51:39,800
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

662
00:51:39,880 --> 00:51:41,600
that decides what we do

663
00:51:41,680 --> 00:51:44,200
and we just have to go along for the ride.

664
00:51:45,240 --> 00:51:47,240
Mirrors let you move through time.

665
00:51:47,720 --> 00:51:48,960
The government monitors people,

666
00:51:49,560 --> 00:51:51,560
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives

667
00:51:52,040 --> 00:51:54,760
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you.

668
00:51:55,200 --> 00:51:57,040
There's messages in every game.

669
00:51:57,120 --> 00:51:59,760
Like Pac-Man.
Do you know what PAC stands for?

670
00:52:00,680 --> 00:52:03,000
P-A-C: "Program and Control."

671
00:52:03,080 --> 00:52:06,920
He's Program and Control Man,
the whole thing's a metaphor,

672
00:52:07,000 --> 00:52:10,040
he thinks he's got free will
but really he's trapped in a maze,

673
00:52:10,120 --> 00:52:12,200
in a system, all he can do is consume,

674
00:52:12,280 --> 00:52:14,600
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head,

675
00:52:14,960 --> 00:52:17,680
and even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

676
00:52:17,760 --> 00:52:20,120
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

677
00:52:20,720 --> 00:52:22,000
People think it's a happy game,

678
00:52:22,080 --> 00:52:25,200
it's not a happy game,

Lot of paths then?

1188
01:35:31,560 --> 01:35:34,760
Well, yeah,
if it's going to be like the book.

1189
01:35:35,040 --> 01:35:37,200
So, come on.
How do you want to go about this?

1190
01:35:38,920 --> 01:35:42,160
-You're... you're interested?
-That's what I'm saying.

1191
01:35:42,240 --> 01:35:44,880
OK, it's July now,
so if we want to hit Christmas,

1192
01:35:44,960 --> 01:35:46,960
then we'll need the tapes in Smiths
by November.

1193
01:35:47,640 --> 01:35:51,400
OK. So here's my proposal.
Come and write it here.

-Here?
-Yeah!

1195

State of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini

1213

and cut his wife's head off?

1227
01:37:46,800 --> 01:37:48,520
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

1228
01:37:48,600 --> 01:37:51,280
Which ending did you get?
When you read it.

-All of them.
-Excuse me.

-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

1231
01:38:00,000 --> 01:38:02,280
Right. So, a lot of paths then?

1232
01:38:02,720 --> 01:38:05,000
Well, yes,
if it's going to be like the book.

1233
01:38:05,080 --> 01:38:06,680
A lot of divergent realities in that book.

At home. On your own?

1248

Yeah, it's just that it's all in my head,

1249
01:39:05,040 --> 01:39:09,040
and I think if I let other people in,
it'll just get, I don't know, stressy?

Parallel realities.

-I get it.

-It's like I say,

bit of madness is what you need
and that works best when it's one mind.

Alright, Timothy Leary, we'll debate

Yes.

1280
01:40:54,920 --> 01:41:00,040
So, how does it work then?
Do you go into their office, or...?

1281
01:41:00,120 --> 01:41:01,480
No, I write it here.

to work on something like this?

-Too?

Well, not to the whole thing,

01:42:23,320 --> 01:42:25,880
just to working there
and being under their control.

I don't know where it came from,

1307
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:29,920
I just said "no"
and then had to justify it

1308
01:42:30,000 --> 01:42:32,120
by saying that I prefer to work alone.

1309
01:42:33,840 --> 01:42:36,760
But I just don't know
where the urge to say it came from.

1310
01:42:37,640 --> 01:42:41,400
It sounds like you're growing
in confidence. I think it's a good sign.

I don't see why I need
to keep coming to these sessions.

I don't know, monitored.

because of the anniversary looming.

It's a difficult time of year for you.
We can't underestimate that.

Would you like to talk
about what happened with your mother?

1323
01:43:39,880 --> 01:43:45,880
It can be helpful to revisit things.
Even if you feel you've done this before.

1324
01:43:47,160 --> 01:43:50,760
You might discover something new.

He hasn't come in,
hasn't answered his phone.

1992
02:40:04,800 --> 02:40:06,240
Par for the course from him.

1993
02:40:06,320 --> 02:40:08,480
He's probably fucked off to Amsterdam
for a spot of gardening.

1994
02:40:08,560 --> 02:40:11,080
He'll be back, he always is.
Anyway, come on.

1995
02:40:21,280 --> 02:40:24,840

Good thing I doubled on the advertising.

-[sighs]

1997
02:40:33,040 --> 02:40:35,760
Stefan, mate. This is due today.
You said it was stable.

1998
02:40:35,840 --> 02:40:37,880
-It was, it was. I just...
-Just what?

1999
02:40:38,440 --> 02:40:40,400
I added in a new path,
the government conspiracy branch.

2000
02:40:40,480 --> 02:40:41,680
Thought I'd tied up the loose ends.

2001
02:40:41,760 --> 02:40:43,600
If it's something you've added,
let's just take it out.

2002

-No, it's important.
-Stefan, mate.

2003

The deadline is today.

2004
02:40:48,160 --> 02:40:51,720
I just need the weekend.
I know I can squeeze this path in.

2005
02:40:51,800 --> 02:40:54,400
-It's complicated enough.
-Just the weekend. Please.

2006
02:40:58,200 --> 02:40:59,760
-First thing Monday.
-First thing.

2007
02:41:00,160 --> 02:41:01,240
OK.

2008
02:41:01,320 --> 02:41:03,440
Shit, I've got to run,
meeting the John Menzies guys.

2009
02:41:04,280 --> 02:41:07,880
Just don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

2010
02:41:08,160 --> 02:41:09,040

[Stefan] What is it?

2015

<i>potential realities splitting in two.</i>

2029
02:42:45,600 --> 02:42:49,560
<i>It was the start</i>
<i>of his complete mental collapse.</i>

2030
02:42:49,760 --> 02:42:53,080
<i>Davies became convinced</i>
<i>he had no control over his fate</i>

2031
02:42:53,160 --> 02:42:56,480

2326
03:23:59,480 --> 03:24:00,760
Who are you?

2327
03:24:03,240 --> 03:24:04,880
Just give me a sign.

2328
03:24:06,520 --> 03:24:09,000
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2329
03:24:09,080 --> 03:24:10,480
Will you give me a sign?

2330
03:24:10,920 --> 03:24:14,320
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

2331
03:24:30,400 --> 03:24:31,360
No!

2332
03:24:34,240 --> 03:24:35,560
Who's doing this to me?

2333
03:24:36,280 --> 03:24:37,720
I know there's someone there.

2334
03:24:39,800 --> 03:24:40,960
Who's there?

2335
03:24:41,640 --> 03:24:42,920
Who are you?

2336
03:24:45,440 --> 03:24:47,080
Just give me a sign.

2337
03:24:48,840 --> 03:24:51,160
Oh, come on, if there's someone there,
just give me a sign.

2338
03:24:51,240 --> 03:24:52,680
Will you give me a sign?

2339
03:24:53,120 --> 03:24:56,480
I know there's someone there.
Just give me a fucking sign!

03:27:17,360 --> 03:27:20,000
Come on, Stefan. Come on.

2343
03:27:23,240 --> 03:27:26,080
-You can find Rabbit later.
-No!

2344
03:27:27,680 --> 03:27:29,320
Stefan, please come with me.

2345
03:27:30,040 --> 03:27:31,080
No!

2346
03:27:50,360 --> 03:27:52,080
You weren't supposed to know.

2347
03:27:54,800 --> 03:27:56,320
Dad, what is this?

2348
03:27:58,200 --> 03:27:59,120
I'm sorry.

2349
03:27:59,920 --> 03:28:01,520
Dad, who are you?

2350
03:28:05,000 --> 03:28:06,440
Talk to me.

2351
03:28:08,160 --> 03:28:09,640
Talk to me!

2352
03:28:17,240 --> 03:28:19,360
-[thud]
-[gasps]

2353
03:28:55,200 --> 03:28:57,000
We've talked about this before,
I'm sure we have.

2354
03:28:57,080 --> 03:28:58,920
So just write me the fucking prescription.

2357
03:30:11,560 --> 03:30:14,160
-Skip to the next bit.
-What?

2358
03:30:14,960 --> 03:30:16,960
For fuck's sake, I'll skip it for you.

Stefan, mate. This is due today.

2369
03:31:15,600 --> 03:31:17,800
I just need the weekend.
I know I can add this new path.

2370
03:31:17,880 --> 03:31:21,120
Don't fuck up.
There's a lot riding on this now.

[Colin] There's messages in every game.
Like Pac-Man.

You know what PAC stands for?

2387
03:34:24,440 --> 03:34:27,520
Program and Control.
He's Program and Control Man.

2388
03:34:27,600 --> 03:34:30,080
It's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world.

I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

One of us is jumping.

2391
03:34:37,880 --> 03:34:39,200
So, who's it going to be?

2392
03:34:44,840 --> 03:34:46,480
There's a nice breeze up here.

2393
03:34:49,880 --> 03:34:50,840
So come on.

2394
03:34:52,320 --> 03:34:53,840

["Relax" playing]

2396
03:35:08,200 --> 03:35:09,040
Breakfast?

-Your Bander-what?
-Bandersnatch.

2398
03:35:12,080 --> 03:35:14,800
-It's a "Choose Your Own Adventure" book.
-The bloody hound from next door.

2402
03:35:27,600 --> 03:35:29,720
That's crazy.
I've played all of his games.

2403
03:35:29,800 --> 03:35:32,920
The state of him, he's made enough
this year to buy a Lamborghini,

2404
03:35:33,000 --> 03:35:36,400
and he still smokes roll-ups. [laughs]

2405
03:35:41,360 --> 03:35:42,560
We've met before.

2406
03:35:43,680 --> 03:35:45,560
-No.
-[Colin] We met before.

2407
03:35:45,640 --> 03:35:48,800
I told you I'd see you around.
And I was right.

-This is what I'm working on.
-Nohzdyve.

Oh, bollocks.

-What's that?
-Buffer error.

-You've read<i> Bandersnatch?</i>
-Jerome F. Davies. Visionary.

2416
03:36:12,520 --> 03:36:14,800
Was he that bloke who went cuckoo
and cut his wife's head off?

2417
03:36:15,320 --> 03:36:17,040
That is what people tend to focus on, yes.

2418
03:36:17,240 --> 03:36:18,560
Excuse me.

2419
03:36:22,200 --> 03:36:25,080
-What's happened?
-I haven't programmed that path yet.

2420
03:36:25,560 --> 03:36:27,280
Lot of divergent realities in that book.

2421
03:36:27,800 --> 03:36:29,240
It was ahead of its time.

2422
03:36:29,760 --> 03:36:31,440
In as much as time exists.

2423
03:36:32,280 --> 03:36:35,000
[claps hands] OK. So, here's my proposal.

Come and write it here.

-Here?
-We'll give you a couple of desks,

2427
03:36:41,320 --> 03:36:42,720
And of course Col's on hand.

All in-house.

Where is he? Where is he?

2460
03:38:31,600 --> 03:38:33,840
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2461
03:38:33,920 --> 03:38:35,280
Kitty. We've met before.

2462

Satpal, I'll deal with this.

-Where's Colin?
-I thought you'd tell me.

2464

He's gone, he's just gone.

2465
03:38:42,520 --> 03:38:44,480
Tell me about it
but he's done this before.

2466
03:38:44,920 --> 03:38:47,360
Not like this. When did you see him last?

2467
03:38:47,560 --> 03:38:50,080
When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2468
03:38:51,120 --> 03:38:52,000
Who's Stefan?

2469
03:38:52,200 --> 03:38:53,800
Let's leave Stefan out of this,
he's working.

2470
03:38:54,280 --> 03:38:55,680
Who's Stefan?

2471
03:38:56,320 --> 03:38:57,920
And how is your father?

2472
03:38:59,200 --> 03:39:02,040
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

2473
03:39:02,360 --> 03:39:04,280
So you've been left to your own devices.

2474
03:39:05,240 --> 03:39:07,720
Hm-hm. [clears throat]

2475
03:39:15,800 --> 03:39:17,160
It's been good actually.

2476
03:39:18,280 --> 03:39:19,360
Not having him.

2477

<i>with the game.</i>

<i>I think I'd got bogged down before,</i>

2480

<i>but now I can see.</i>

2481
03:39:36,000 --> 03:39:37,520
[Haynes]<i> So you finally finished it?</i>

2482
03:39:38,000 --> 03:39:41,400
[Stefan] <i>Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

2483
03:39:41,960 --> 03:39:44,320
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

2484
03:39:44,640 --> 03:39:47,240
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

2485
03:39:48,080 --> 03:39:51,480
<i>And now they've only got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really,</i>

2486

I decide the ending.

2487
03:39:56,240 --> 03:39:58,040
And is it a happy ending?

2488
03:39:59,560 --> 03:40:02,400
-I think so.
-[Haynes] Then that's great.

Dr. Haynes' office.

2492
03:40:36,840 --> 03:40:38,360
Is Dr. Haynes there?

2493
03:40:38,440 --> 03:40:40,400
[receptionist] <i>No,</i>
<i>she's with a client right now.</i>

2494
03:40:40,480 --> 03:40:45,680
<i>Would you like to make an appointment?</i>
<i>I could fit you in first thing tomorrow.</i>

2495
03:40:46,560 --> 03:40:47,440
Yes.

2496
03:40:48,200 --> 03:40:51,320

2498
03:40:55,040 --> 03:40:58,760
[Kitty] Where's Colin?
Where is he? Where is he?

2499
03:40:58,840 --> 03:41:01,080
-Woah, woah, woah. Can I help?
-It's Colin's girlfriend.

2500
03:41:01,160 --> 03:41:02,520
Kitty. We've met before.

2501
03:41:03,240 --> 03:41:05,680
When you had blue hair.
Satpal, I'll deal with this.

2502
03:41:05,960 --> 03:41:06,800
Where's Colin?

2503
03:41:06,880 --> 03:41:09,320
-I thought you'd tell me.
-He's gone, he's just gone.

2504
03:41:09,640 --> 03:41:11,720
Tell me about it,
but he's done this before.

2505
03:41:12,160 --> 03:41:16,680
-Not like this. When did you see him last?
-When he gave me that tape for Stefan.

2506
03:41:18,280 --> 03:41:19,240
Who's Stefan?

2507
03:41:19,320 --> 03:41:21,040
Let's leave Stefan out of this,

And how is your father?

2510
03:41:26,480 --> 03:41:29,280
He's visiting his sister.
She's in the South of France, so...

2511
03:41:29,480 --> 03:41:34,960
-So you've been left to your own devices.
-Hm-hm. [clears throat]

2512
03:41:43,040 --> 03:41:44,360
It's been good actually.

2513
03:41:45,520 --> 03:41:46,600
Not having him.

2514
03:41:48,520 --> 03:41:51,000
[Stefan] <i>It's meant I could work</i>

2515
03:41:54,760 --> 03:41:56,800
<i>I've actually had a bit of breakthrough</i>
<i>with the game.</i>

2516
03:41:57,880 --> 03:42:00,840
<i>I think I'd got bogged down before,</i>

03:42:01,920 --> 03:42:03,040
<i>but now I can see.</i>

2518
03:42:03,280 --> 03:42:08,640
-[Haynes] <i>So you finally finished it?</i>
-[Stefan]<i> Finished, delivered, everything.</i>

2519
03:42:09,160 --> 03:42:11,560
<i>I'd been trying to give the player</i>
<i>too much choice.</i>

2520
03:42:11,920 --> 03:42:14,480
<i>So I just went back</i>
<i>and stripped loads out.</i>

2521

<i>And now they've only got the illusion</i>
<i>of free will, but really,</i>

2522
03:42:19,240 --> 03:42:20,840
I decide the ending.

2523
03:42:23,480 --> 03:42:25,240
And is it a happy ending?

2524
03:42:26,840 --> 03:42:29,640
-I think so.
-[Haynes] Then that's great.

2525
03:42:55,000 --> 03:42:56,760
Oh, God, really?

2526

-[engaged tone on phone]
-He's fucking engaged.

2533
03:43:22,480 --> 03:43:24,240
He's probably taken the phone
off the hook.

2534
03:43:26,400 --> 03:43:28,920
-That's what I do.
-That's what you do, is it?

2535
03:43:29,320 --> 03:43:30,400
I'll remember that.

2536
03:43:32,880 --> 03:43:35,440
Look, just let him be.

2537
03:43:36,120 --> 03:43:38,120
He's probably in the zone.

2538
03:43:38,200 --> 03:43:41,520
[Thakur] OK.
I'll give him another twenty-four hours.

Wakey-wakey. Bandersnatch.

I've booked the dupe plant.

There's some serious cash down

You shouldn't rush him.
He needs to explore all possibilities.

03:51:16,600 --> 03:51:18,400
In as much as you have any choice.

2655
03:51:32,000 --> 03:51:34,240
Imagine that's a bit
anti-climactic for you.

2656
03:51:35,960 --> 03:51:37,360
But appreciated.

2657
03:51:38,120 --> 03:51:39,640
I'm quite enjoying this lifetime.

2658
03:51:40,920 --> 03:51:42,040
See you in the next one.

2659
03:52:11,920 --> 03:52:15,040
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2660
03:52:15,120 --> 03:52:18,040
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2661
03:52:18,480 --> 03:52:20,600
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2662
03:52:21,440 --> 03:52:25,280
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2663
03:52:25,360 --> 03:52:29,480
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2664
03:52:29,560 --> 03:52:30,680
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2665
03:52:31,440 --> 03:52:34,480
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2666
03:52:34,560 --> 03:52:36,880
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2667
03:52:36,960 --> 03:52:40,960
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2668
03:52:41,440 --> 03:52:43,480
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2669
03:52:43,560 --> 03:52:47,040
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2670
03:52:47,280 --> 03:52:49,480
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2671

2672
03:52:52,080 --> 03:52:54,000
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2673
03:52:54,080 --> 03:52:57,400
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2674
03:52:57,480 --> 03:52:59,480
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2675
03:52:59,960 --> 03:53:02,800
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2676
03:53:02,880 --> 03:53:04,640
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2677
03:53:05,000 --> 03:53:08,480
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2678
03:53:08,880 --> 03:53:12,480
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

murder charge against its creator,

2818
04:03:58,280 --> 04:04:00,440
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2819
04:04:00,520 --> 04:04:02,920
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2820
04:04:03,000 --> 04:04:04,920
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2821
04:04:05,000 --> 04:04:07,440
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2822
04:04:07,520 --> 04:04:10,400
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2823
04:04:10,880 --> 04:04:13,720
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2824
04:04:13,800 --> 04:04:15,560
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2825
04:04:15,920 --> 04:04:19,440
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2826
04:04:19,800 --> 04:04:23,320
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2827
04:04:23,400 --> 04:04:27,560
[Crispin] <i>But there's another Tuckersoft</i>
<i>protégé at the center of a mystery.</i>

2828
04:04:27,920 --> 04:04:30,920
<i>Famed programmer Colin Ritman</i>
<i>is still missing,</i>

2829
04:04:31,000 --> 04:04:34,840
<i>having vanished without trace</i>
<i>shortly before the killings.</i>

2830
04:04:35,160 --> 04:04:37,640
<i>At the trial,</i>
<i>Butler denied any involvement</i>

2831
04:04:37,720 --> 04:04:39,960
<i>in Ritman's sudden disappearance,</i>

2832
04:04:40,040 --> 04:04:44,320
<i>claiming he had seen Ritman</i>
<i>committing suicide in a vision.</i>

2833
04:04:44,520 --> 04:04:47,720
<i>Today, Tuckersoft closed its doors</i>
<i>for good.</i>

2834
04:04:47,800 --> 04:04:50,800
<i>And there was no sign of Bandersnatch.</i>

2835
04:05:16,480 --> 04:05:20,120
[doorbell rings]

2836
04:05:29,920 --> 04:05:32,840
[doorbell continues]

2837
04:05:37,000 --> 04:05:38,440
[knocking at door]

2838
04:05:45,520 --> 04:05:46,800
Well, you need a hand.

2839
04:05:50,560 --> 04:05:52,360
Come on, lead me to it.

2840
04:05:53,800 --> 04:05:56,640
-To what?
-Bandersnatch.

2841
04:05:57,240 --> 04:05:59,160
Where's your pit? Up there?

2842
04:06:09,040 --> 04:06:10,480
[Colin] Fucking hell.

2843
04:06:11,080 --> 04:06:12,920
You've gone right down the hole, mate.

2844
04:06:13,800 --> 04:06:15,040
Right down it.

2845
04:06:22,360 --> 04:06:23,480
I killed my dad.

2846
04:06:25,560 --> 04:06:26,680
Right.

2847
04:06:29,720 --> 04:06:32,160
So are you gonna let me go,
or are you gonna kill me?

2848
04:06:39,040 --> 04:06:40,400
I mean, it's your choice.

2849
04:06:41,440 --> 04:06:43,320
In as much as you have any choice.

2850
04:06:46,920 --> 04:06:47,760
I'm sorry.

2851
04:06:49,040 --> 04:06:52,120
Alright. No point arguing about it.

2852
04:06:52,600 --> 04:06:54,280
Not with that though. They sting.

2853
04:06:56,320 --> 04:06:57,560
You got anything blunt?

2854
04:07:01,840 --> 04:07:03,400
Stun me first.

2855
04:07:04,000 --> 04:07:05,360
Bit more humane.

2856
04:07:16,120 --> 04:07:17,040
Try this.

2857
04:07:23,080 --> 04:07:24,040
[thud]

2858
04:07:27,080 --> 04:07:28,600
See you in the next life, yeah?

2859
04:07:38,720 --> 04:07:40,080
Come on, on me head.

2860
04:07:41,080 --> 04:07:41,920
[thud]

2861
04:07:46,480 --> 04:07:48,160
That really is fascinating.

2862
04:07:48,240 --> 04:07:51,000
Although we've got many years to go
before virtual reality

2863
04:07:51,080 --> 04:07:52,920
becomes actual reality.

2864
04:07:53,400 --> 04:07:55,280
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2865
04:07:56,000 --> 04:07:59,600
Now, six months ago,
we were shocked to hear of the murder

2866
04:07:59,680 --> 04:08:02,200
of famed programmer Colin Ritman,

2867
04:08:02,280 --> 04:08:06,200
creator of Metl Hedd, Nohzdyve,
and many other games.

2868
04:08:06,280 --> 04:08:09,000
Today, his murderer is behind bars.

2869
04:08:09,080 --> 04:08:11,240
But could the crime have been prevented?

2870
04:08:11,840 --> 04:08:15,080
<i>In October of last year,</i>

-Don't forget your tea.
-Cheers.

2914

What have you done?

2915
04:11:36,200 --> 04:11:37,640
I chose for you.

2916
04:11:39,840 --> 04:11:41,080
Are you OK with that?

2917
04:11:42,280 --> 04:11:44,440
Yeah. [laughs]

2918
04:11:48,640 --> 04:11:50,920
[laughs]

2919
04:12:12,120 --> 04:12:13,880
[Colin] People think there's one reality

2920
04:12:13,960 --> 04:12:16,200
but there's loads of them,
all snaking off, like roots.

2921
04:12:16,280 --> 04:12:18,920
And what you do on one path
affects what happens on the other paths.

2922
04:12:19,160 --> 04:12:20,840
Time is a construct.

2923
04:12:20,920 --> 04:12:24,040
People think you can't go back
and change things, but you can.

2924
04:12:24,120 --> 04:12:25,400
That's what flashbacks are.

2925
04:12:25,480 --> 04:12:28,360
They're invitations to go back
and make different choices.

2926
04:12:28,440 --> 04:12:31,440
When you make a decision,
you think it's you doing it, but it's not.

2927
04:12:31,520 --> 04:12:34,280
It's the spirit out there
that's connected to our world

2928
04:12:34,480 --> 04:12:38,680
that decides what we do
and we just have to go along for the ride.

2929
04:12:39,720 --> 04:12:41,720
Mirrors let you move through time.

2930
04:12:42,200 --> 04:12:43,440
The government monitors people,

2931
04:12:44,040 --> 04:12:46,040
they pay people to pretend
to be your relatives,

2932
04:12:46,560 --> 04:12:49,240
and they put drugs in your food
and they film you

2933
04:12:49,720 --> 04:12:51,520
There's messages in every game.

2934
04:12:51,800 --> 04:12:54,240
Like Pac-Man,
do you know what PAC stands for?

2935
04:12:55,160 --> 04:12:57,480
P-A-C. Program and Control.

2936
04:12:57,560 --> 04:12:59,400
He's Program and Control Man.

2937
04:13:00,440 --> 04:13:01,400
The whole thing's a metaphor.

2938
04:13:01,680 --> 04:13:04,520
He thinks he's got free will
but really, he's trapped in a maze,

2939
04:13:04,760 --> 04:13:06,720
in a system, all he can do is consume,

2940
04:13:06,800 --> 04:13:09,080
he's pursued by demons
that are probably just in his own head.

2941
04:13:09,440 --> 04:13:12,160
And even if he does manage to escape
by slipping out one side of the maze,

2942
04:13:12,440 --> 04:13:14,600
what happens?
He comes right back in the other side.

2943
04:13:15,200 --> 04:13:16,480
People think it's a happy game,

2944
04:13:16,720 --> 04:13:19,520
it's not a happy game,
it's a fucking nightmare world

2945
04:13:19,600 --> 04:13:22,000
and the worst thing is
it's real and we live in it.

2946
04:13:22,320 --> 04:13:23,160
It's all a code.

2947
04:13:23,880 --> 04:13:26,040
If you listen closely,
you can hear the numbers.

2948
04:13:27,680 --> 04:13:30,280
There's a cosmic flowchart
that dictates where you can

2949
04:13:30,760 --> 04:13:32,360
and where you can't go.

2950
04:13:33,680 --> 04:13:36,640
I've given you the knowledge.
I've set you free.

2951
04:13:38,920 --> 04:13:40,040
Do you understand?

2952
04:13:42,280 --> 04:13:43,200
Maybe.

2953
04:13:44,720 --> 04:13:46,440
Yes. Sort of.

2954
04:13:46,800 --> 04:13:48,320
I'll show you what I mean.

2955
04:13:49,680 --> 04:13:50,520
Come with me.

2956
04:13:59,240 --> 04:14:00,880
We're on one path.

2957
04:14:01,560 --> 04:14:03,160
Right now, me and you.

2958
04:14:04,040 --> 04:14:06,640
And how one path ends is immaterial.

2959
04:14:06,880 --> 04:14:12,560
It's how our decisions along that path
affect the whole that matters.

2960
04:14:13,240 --> 04:14:14,440
Do you believe me?

2961
04:14:15,640 --> 04:14:19,760
-[sniggers] I don't know.
-I'll prove it.

2962
04:14:20,640 --> 04:14:23,880
One of us is going over.

2963
04:14:25,280 --> 04:14:26,320
Over there.

2964
04:14:30,680 --> 04:14:31,800
You'd die. You'd die.

2965
04:14:32,560 --> 04:14:36,680
It wouldn't matter
because there are other timelines, Stefan.

2966
04:14:37,400 --> 04:14:39,640
How many times have you watched
Pac-Man die?

2967
04:14:40,400 --> 04:14:41,720
Doesn't bother him.

2968
04:14:42,960 --> 04:14:44,400
He just tries again.

2969
04:14:45,280 --> 04:14:46,680
One of us is jumping.

2970
04:14:47,560 --> 04:14:48,920
So, who's it going to be?

2971
04:14:54,520 --> 04:14:56,200
There's a nice breeze up here.

2972
04:14:59,560 --> 04:15:00,560
So come on.

2973
04:15:02,040 --> 04:15:03,560
Which one of us is jumping?

2974
04:15:11,440 --> 04:15:14,560
So, that's how
the wireframe models of today

2975
04:15:14,640 --> 04:15:17,760
might provide the Hollywood entertainment
of the future.

2976
04:15:17,960 --> 04:15:20,160
-Crispin.
-Thanks, Leslie.

2977
04:15:20,840 --> 04:15:24,800
Now, yesterday, following weeks
of controversy and speculation,

2978
04:15:24,880 --> 04:15:28,880
games company Tuckersoft announced
it's going into administration.

2979
04:15:28,960 --> 04:15:30,200
<i>So, what went wrong?</i>

2980
04:15:30,840 --> 04:15:34,000
<i>Just six months ago,</i>
<i>Tuckersoft was riding high,</i>

2981
04:15:34,080 --> 04:15:36,400
<i>with a string of hits topping the charts</i>

2982
04:15:36,480 --> 04:15:40,480
<i>and mounting anticipation for their big</i>
<i>Christmas release, Bandersnatch.</i>

2983
04:15:40,840 --> 04:15:43,000
But Bandersnatch never appeared,

2984
04:15:43,080 --> 04:15:46,560
following the arrest and subsequent
murder charge against its creator,

2985
04:15:46,640 --> 04:15:49,040
<i>19-year-old Stefan Butler,</i>

2986
04:15:49,120 --> 04:15:51,440
<i>who stands accused</i>
<i>of murdering his father</i>

2987
04:15:51,520 --> 04:15:53,520
<i>following a psychological breakdown.</i>

2988
04:15:53,600 --> 04:15:56,080
<i>This has raised questions</i>
<i>about the judgment</i>

2989
04:15:56,160 --> 04:15:59,000
<i>of Tuckersoft boss, Mohan Thakur.</i>

2990
04:15:59,480 --> 04:16:02,320
It was his idea to do it alone.
His decision.

2991
04:16:02,400 --> 04:16:04,160
I wasn't to know he couldn't hack it.

2992
04:16:04,520 --> 04:16:08,040
I mean, I know his dad's dead,
rest his soul,

2993
04:16:08,400 --> 04:16:12,040
but I'm a victim, too.
Let's try to not forget that.

2994

[Crispin] <i>Another Tuckersoft protégé,</i>
<i>famed programmer Colin Ritman,</i>

2995
04:16:16,600 --> 04:16:21,040
<i>believes there are important lessons</i>
<i>to be learned from Butler's unravelling.</i>

2996
04:16:21,600 --> 04:16:24,160
What would you say to Stefan,
if he could hear you?

2997
04:16:25,320 --> 04:16:26,800
I'd say try again.

2998
04:16:27,760 --> 04:16:28,840
But he's in prison.

2999
04:16:29,880 --> 04:16:31,560
<i>Only in this life.</i>

04:16:32,120 --> 04:16:34,800
[Crispin] <i>Shortly after this interview,</i>
<i>Colin Ritman was arrested</i>

3001
04:16:34,880 --> 04:16:37,120
<i>for possession of controlled substances.</i>

3002
04:16:37,200 --> 04:16:42,760

Me and my friend from the future! [laughs]

3007
04:17:14,960 --> 04:17:18,680

you stay on the pharmaceutical path

3008

3009
