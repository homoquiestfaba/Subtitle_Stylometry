1
00:00:36,666 --> 00:00:39,041
<i>Christmas is almost here.</i>

2
00:00:41,666 --> 00:00:46,333
<i>And after that day,
I know my life will never be the same.</i>

3
00:00:48,250 --> 00:00:50,166
<i>I'm a little scared.</i>

4
00:00:50,250 --> 00:00:53,916
<i>Well, to be honest, a lot scared.</i>

5
00:00:54,833 --> 00:00:57,916
<i>What will happen to me, to us?</i>

6
00:00:59,208 --> 00:01:02,041
<i>And then there's little Jacob.</i>

7
00:01:02,833 --> 00:01:04,916
<i>What about him?</i>

8
00:01:06,500 --> 00:01:08,791
<i>I just hope he'll be okay.</i>

9
00:01:40,666 --> 00:01:42,666
There he is!

10
00:01:49,458 --> 00:01:53,208
How's everybody doing?
See you in there. Thanks for coming.

11
00:01:55,833 --> 00:01:59,458
In Book Five, will we finally
learn the truth about Camille?

12
00:01:59,541 --> 00:02:02,458
Is she part of the French Resistance
like she says?

13
00:02:02,541 --> 00:02:05,000
Or is she really a Nazi spy?

14
00:02:05,500 --> 00:02:07,666
You know, I've been going
back and forth on that one.

15
00:02:07,750 --> 00:02:10,833
Make her a heroine!
Oh, it's so much more romantic.

16
00:02:10,916 --> 00:02:13,416
- Yeah...
- Then again, a spy is sexier.

17
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:15,000
Hmm! You know what?

18
00:02:15,083 --> 00:02:17,041
Double agent.

19
00:02:17,125 --> 00:02:18,208
Oh!

20
00:02:19,041 --> 00:02:22,333
Could you inscribe it to Sherri, please?
I'm Sherri.

21
00:02:23,375 --> 00:02:24,916
So is it an "I" or a "Y"?

22
00:02:25,458 --> 00:02:28,000
Either is fine.

23
00:02:30,833 --> 00:02:34,250
You recognize me, <i>non</i>? Book Three.

24
00:02:34,333 --> 00:02:38,583
Of course, of course!
Camille Toussaint. How are you?

25
00:02:38,666 --> 00:02:40,708
Very well, sir. Very well.

26
00:02:42,291 --> 00:02:43,791
Merry Christmas, Camille.

27
00:02:44,750 --> 00:02:46,041
Thank you so much!

28
00:02:47,916 --> 00:02:49,750
Make it out to Todd and Mark.

29
00:02:49,833 --> 00:02:50,833
Sure.

30
00:02:50,875 --> 00:02:53,708
Oh, make that Mark and Todd.
I read the book first.

31
00:02:53,791 --> 00:02:56,375
No way. Don't you remember?
Your sister gave it to me.

32
00:02:56,458 --> 00:02:59,125
- No, your sister gave it to me...
- Tell you what, fellas.

33
00:02:59,208 --> 00:03:01,808
You know what I'm gonna do?
I'm gonna go ahead and sign two books.

34
00:03:01,875 --> 00:03:04,041
One for each of you, okay?

35
00:03:04,125 --> 00:03:05,916
My treat. There you go.

36
00:03:07,958 --> 00:03:10,625
So, are you staying in the city
for the holidays?

37
00:03:10,708 --> 00:03:11,958
I'm afraid not.

38
00:03:12,041 --> 00:03:14,250
- Gotta get home to my girl, Ava.
- Oh.

39
00:03:14,333 --> 00:03:15,833
I didn't know that you were...

40
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,666
Well, she's a very lucky woman.

41
00:03:19,958 --> 00:03:21,958
- Merry Christmas.
- Merry Christmas.

42
00:04:36,666 --> 00:04:38,958
Ava, hon, I'm home!

43
00:04:46,416 --> 00:04:47,250
Ava?

44
00:04:47,333 --> 00:04:50,166
Come here! Come here, baby.

45
00:04:50,250 --> 00:04:53,250
What's up? How are you? Come here! Hi! Hi!

46
00:04:53,333 --> 00:04:56,041
- Welcome home, Mr. Jacob.
- Oh, thanks, Svet. Thanks.

47
00:04:56,125 --> 00:04:58,375
Hi, how are you? Hello!

48
00:04:58,458 --> 00:05:00,291
- Everything under control? Yeah?
- Mmm-hmm.

49
00:05:00,375 --> 00:05:03,958
- Yeah. Refrigerator is full. Ava has bath.
- Yeah. Okay.

50
00:05:04,041 --> 00:05:05,625
I bring in extra firewood.

51
00:05:06,333 --> 00:05:08,500
Oh, and, uh, fan mail.

52
00:05:08,583 --> 00:05:09,458
Oof.

53
00:05:09,541 --> 00:05:11,541
More even than last book, I think.

54
00:05:11,625 --> 00:05:13,333
Wow. Okay, fan mail. Look at that.

55
00:05:13,416 --> 00:05:15,958
Now I know what I'm doing
for the next couple weeks, right?

56
00:05:16,041 --> 00:05:18,375
Thank you for
holding down the fort while I was gone.

57
00:05:18,458 --> 00:05:21,041
- Mmm-hmm.
- Oh, I almost forgot.

58
00:05:22,125 --> 00:05:24,541
- This, Svetlana, is for you.
- Oh!

59
00:05:24,625 --> 00:05:25,833
Happy holidays.

60
00:05:25,916 --> 00:05:28,250
- And, you know, thank you for everything.
- Oh, thank you.

61
00:05:29,791 --> 00:05:31,416
You're gonna be okay, Mr. Jacob?

62
00:05:32,458 --> 00:05:35,291
Okay? Yeah, what do you mean?
It's me. Of course. I'm always okay.

63
00:05:36,208 --> 00:05:37,666
But also always alone.

64
00:05:38,458 --> 00:05:41,833
I'm alone because I prefer it that way,
you know that. Besides, I'm not alone.

65
00:05:41,916 --> 00:05:44,541
I got my best girl here, Ava.
She'll keep me company.

66
00:05:47,333 --> 00:05:51,500
- See you next year, Mr. Jacob.
- Yeah! See you, you know...

67
00:05:52,375 --> 00:05:54,208
Ava! Come here.

68
00:06:01,625 --> 00:06:03,500
Let's, uh, see what we got here.

69
00:06:14,333 --> 00:06:15,666
No.

70
00:06:15,750 --> 00:06:18,666
Ah, there we go. All right.

71
00:06:19,791 --> 00:06:22,208
I could get down with that.
That's good. That is good.

72
00:07:07,583 --> 00:07:10,000
- Hello?
<i>- Hi, is this, uh, Jacob Turner?</i>

73
00:07:12,958 --> 00:07:14,000
Yeah, this is,

74
00:07:14,083 --> 00:07:17,750
but, you know, I don't need
my carpets cleaned, or a home loan, or...

75
00:07:17,833 --> 00:07:21,833
<i>Yeah. Uh, Mr. Turner, apologies.
I was, uh... hesitant to leave a message.</i>

76
00:07:21,916 --> 00:07:24,750
<i>My name is Matt Segreto. I'm an attorney...</i>

77
00:07:24,833 --> 00:07:28,000
Oh, let me guess. You have a client
who claims I stole one of their ideas.

78
00:07:28,083 --> 00:07:29,208
<i>No, um...</i>

79
00:07:30,750 --> 00:07:33,791
<i>I'm the executor of your mother's estate.</i>

80
00:07:37,791 --> 00:07:41,250
I'm sorry. You're, uh... What was that?

81
00:07:41,333 --> 00:07:45,166
<i>I really am sorry
to be the one to tell you. Uh...</i>

82
00:07:45,958 --> 00:07:47,333
<i>She passed last week.</i>

83
00:07:48,750 --> 00:07:49,875
<i>I thought you knew.</i>

84
00:07:51,000 --> 00:07:52,416
No, I... I didn't know that.

85
00:07:58,166 --> 00:08:00,875
My mother and I
hadn't spoken in a long time.

86
00:08:00,958 --> 00:08:02,541
Our relationship was, uh...

87
00:08:04,000 --> 00:08:05,083
complicated.

88
00:08:05,833 --> 00:08:07,041
<i>I understand.</i>

89
00:08:07,625 --> 00:08:12,291
<i>She left everything to you, um,
her house and all her furnishings.</i>

90
00:08:13,916 --> 00:08:16,125
<i>There's some paperwork
that needs to be signed.</i>

91
00:08:16,208 --> 00:08:19,791
<i>Um, I can arrange to meet you
in Bridgeport one day next week,</i>

92
00:08:19,875 --> 00:08:21,041
<i>if that's convenient.</i>

93
00:08:40,333 --> 00:08:41,625
- Mr. Turner.
- Hey!

94
00:08:42,291 --> 00:08:43,291
Matt Segreto.

95
00:08:45,333 --> 00:08:46,892
- Thanks for meeting me out here.
- Yeah.

96
00:08:46,916 --> 00:08:48,476
- I'm so sorry for your loss.
- Thank you.

97
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,583
Place must bring back a lot of memories.

98
00:08:52,625 --> 00:08:53,750
You have no idea.

99
00:08:57,583 --> 00:08:59,041
- You just, uh...
- Yeah.

100
00:09:10,208 --> 00:09:11,791
Oh!

101
00:09:11,875 --> 00:09:12,875
Careful.

102
00:09:15,208 --> 00:09:16,333
Whoa.

103
00:09:16,416 --> 00:09:17,416
Ugh.

104
00:09:19,083 --> 00:09:21,208
Yeah, neighbors said
she rarely left the house.

105
00:09:21,291 --> 00:09:23,375
And when they dropped by,
she never let them in.

106
00:09:23,458 --> 00:09:25,416
Now I know why.

107
00:09:25,500 --> 00:09:28,750
Should be a piano
hiding over here somewhere.

108
00:09:28,833 --> 00:09:34,375
Um, yep. According to the inventory,
it's a Steinway Model S, 1940.

109
00:09:34,458 --> 00:09:36,458
It's worth about 40 grand.

110
00:09:37,041 --> 00:09:38,041
Hmm.

111
00:09:38,791 --> 00:09:41,666
From the look of things,
you're gonna be doing a lot of trash runs.

112
00:09:41,750 --> 00:09:44,208
Do you want me to
get a dumpster rental for you?

113
00:09:45,375 --> 00:09:46,375
Huh?

114
00:09:46,708 --> 00:09:48,375
Oh, uh... Yeah.

115
00:09:49,291 --> 00:09:50,666
- Thanks.
- Yeah.

116
00:09:50,750 --> 00:09:52,958
And, um, Mr. Turner...

117
00:09:53,541 --> 00:09:54,625
Jake.

118
00:09:54,708 --> 00:09:58,875
I hate to bother you,
but my wife is just a huge fan, and, um...

119
00:09:58,958 --> 00:10:01,000
Okay.

120
00:10:01,708 --> 00:10:03,833
You know, us Regular Joes
can never really live up

121
00:10:04,416 --> 00:10:06,458
to the super-suave dudes in your books.

122
00:10:07,583 --> 00:10:09,750
Those dudes aren't real, Matt.

123
00:10:09,833 --> 00:10:12,083
Yeah, tell that to my wife.

124
00:10:13,458 --> 00:10:15,083
Her name's Mercedes.

125
00:10:16,208 --> 00:10:17,208
Like the car.

126
00:10:17,291 --> 00:10:19,125
Right.

127
00:10:20,375 --> 00:10:21,541
- Here you go.
- Thank you.

128
00:11:16,833 --> 00:11:17,833
Come on, babe.

129
00:11:23,875 --> 00:11:26,166
All right, you ready? Hop on up.

130
00:11:26,750 --> 00:11:27,750
Good girl.

131
00:11:31,375 --> 00:11:33,041
Simply exquisite.

132
00:11:35,875 --> 00:11:37,125
Ellie, is that you?

133
00:11:37,208 --> 00:11:39,000
Jacob, you came!

134
00:11:39,875 --> 00:11:40,875
Of course.

135
00:11:40,958 --> 00:11:45,541
I don't know, somehow I assumed
that you'd send an assistant or someone,

136
00:11:45,625 --> 00:11:47,916
I guess because you're so famous now.

137
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:51,750
No, some things you gotta do on your own.
So good to see you. You look great.

138
00:11:51,833 --> 00:11:55,291
You too. It's been a long time.
What, it's 20 years, probably?

139
00:11:55,375 --> 00:11:58,333
- You were about 18 when you left.
- 17 when I left.

140
00:11:59,000 --> 00:12:01,583
That was
a really tough time for you.

141
00:12:01,666 --> 00:12:02,791
Yeah, it was.

142
00:12:03,625 --> 00:12:05,465
But, you know,
I always knew you'd be a writer.

143
00:12:06,708 --> 00:12:08,208
You were an interesting kid.

144
00:12:08,291 --> 00:12:12,208
You had a wonderful imagination,
and you loved words.

145
00:12:12,291 --> 00:12:17,875
I remember sitting in your den for hours,
playing online <i>Scrabble.</i>

146
00:12:17,958 --> 00:12:20,833
Oh, whenever your mom
had a really bad day.

147
00:12:21,541 --> 00:12:23,666
Mom had a lot of bad days, didn't she?

148
00:12:23,750 --> 00:12:25,416
She was never the same.

149
00:12:29,083 --> 00:12:30,208
None of us were.

150
00:12:39,083 --> 00:12:40,708
They're good!

151
00:12:43,250 --> 00:12:45,791
- Oh, wonderful.
- That's sweet. Thank you.

152
00:12:45,875 --> 00:12:47,000
- Bye-bye now.
- Bye.

153
00:12:47,083 --> 00:12:48,208
Hey, are you still painting?

154
00:12:48,916 --> 00:12:51,125
You might as well
ask if I'm still breathing.

155
00:12:52,333 --> 00:12:54,708
Listen, I'm glad I ran into you.
It's good to see you.

156
00:12:54,791 --> 00:12:57,083
I'm about ready to take off. I gotta, um...

157
00:12:58,250 --> 00:13:00,708
I gotta come back tomorrow
and tackle another room.

158
00:13:00,791 --> 00:13:04,000
It's gotta be really,
really hard going through all her stuff.

159
00:13:04,708 --> 00:13:07,625
Yeah. What was it
that Robert Frost always said?

160
00:13:07,708 --> 00:13:10,541
He said, "The best way out
is always through," right?

161
00:13:10,625 --> 00:13:13,958
Although I'm pretty sure
he never met a hoarder.

162
00:13:14,541 --> 00:13:16,250
I would imagine not.

163
00:13:48,250 --> 00:13:49,666
It's lonely out here.

164
00:13:50,750 --> 00:13:51,833
And I miss you.

165
00:14:37,875 --> 00:14:39,250
Oh, God! Oh, come on!

166
00:14:56,125 --> 00:14:58,375
Oh, come on, Mom, really?

167
00:15:00,666 --> 00:15:02,083
What?

168
00:15:48,708 --> 00:15:51,333
Still like a grilled cheese
with tomato soup?

169
00:15:52,333 --> 00:15:55,041
I figured you'd probably worked up
a pretty good appetite by now.

170
00:15:55,125 --> 00:15:56,416
You kidding? I'm starving.

171
00:15:56,500 --> 00:15:59,833
- Does she like tomato soup? Is this okay?
- She loves it. Yeah. Yeah, it's great.

172
00:15:59,916 --> 00:16:00,958
Oh, there you go.

173
00:16:03,958 --> 00:16:05,541
- Oh, she does!
- Look at that!

174
00:16:05,625 --> 00:16:07,916
We don't know how to thank you.
Do we, Ava?

175
00:16:08,875 --> 00:16:11,708
- You could put me in your next novel.
- Whoa, whoa, hold on a second.

176
00:16:11,791 --> 00:16:13,500
You actually read my novels?

177
00:16:13,583 --> 00:16:17,416
I'm probably the only one of your readers
who can recognize some of the characters.

178
00:16:17,500 --> 00:16:18,791
Like whom, for instance?

179
00:16:18,875 --> 00:16:21,791
- Well, in <i>Green Eyes.
- Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

180
00:16:21,875 --> 00:16:23,291
Yeah, the photographer.

181
00:16:23,375 --> 00:16:26,083
Beautiful, strong woman
who has a breakdown.

182
00:16:26,666 --> 00:16:28,791
Well, that one's pretty obvious,
though, right?

183
00:16:28,875 --> 00:16:33,000
There's another character I recognize,
you know, in <i>The Final Midnight.</i>

184
00:16:33,083 --> 00:16:34,458
The father of the soldier.

185
00:16:34,541 --> 00:16:37,625
Very minor character, though.
Sort of like in real life.

186
00:16:37,708 --> 00:16:41,125
Your memories of him can't be all that bad
if you're still wearing his watch.

187
00:16:44,208 --> 00:16:46,833
He came to your mother's funeral.
Did you know that?

188
00:16:48,125 --> 00:16:51,375
To pay his respects, but I'm pretty sure
he was hoping to see you there.

189
00:16:51,875 --> 00:16:53,208
No, I don't...

190
00:16:54,583 --> 00:16:56,625
I don't think so, no.

191
00:16:56,708 --> 00:16:59,000
And the funeral... the funeral, I feel...

192
00:16:59,083 --> 00:17:02,791
It's understandable,
but it doesn't matter anymore.

193
00:17:02,875 --> 00:17:04,875
That was then. This is now.

194
00:17:05,666 --> 00:17:06,666
Thanks.

195
00:17:07,083 --> 00:17:10,000
- And can I ask you a question?
- Yeah.

196
00:17:11,125 --> 00:17:13,125
- It's personal.
- Sure.

197
00:17:14,666 --> 00:17:15,666
Um...

198
00:17:16,208 --> 00:17:17,875
Am I too old for this?

199
00:17:19,458 --> 00:17:20,333
Are...

200
00:17:20,416 --> 00:17:22,083
- This is your question?
- Yes.

201
00:17:22,166 --> 00:17:23,916
No! No.

202
00:17:24,416 --> 00:17:26,041
- Seriously?
- This is perfect.

203
00:17:26,125 --> 00:17:28,875
Have you tried one of these?
Of course not. Why would you?

204
00:17:28,958 --> 00:17:30,750
You got women linin' up on your doorstep.

205
00:17:30,833 --> 00:17:33,666
I do not have women
lining up on my doorstep.

206
00:17:33,750 --> 00:17:36,958
I see those magazines at the supermarket.
You date movie stars.

207
00:17:37,041 --> 00:17:40,333
All right.
Listen, they will print anything.

208
00:17:40,416 --> 00:17:43,056
But the answer to your question,
no, I have not tried a dating app,

209
00:17:43,125 --> 00:17:44,750
but I think you absolutely should.

210
00:17:44,833 --> 00:17:46,083
I have to write something.

211
00:17:46,166 --> 00:17:47,291
- Dating profile?
- Yeah.

212
00:17:47,375 --> 00:17:49,208
I know a writer. May I?

213
00:17:49,291 --> 00:17:52,458
- You're gonna write my profile? Oh!
- It would be my pleasure.

214
00:17:53,250 --> 00:17:54,250
Hmm.

215
00:18:50,333 --> 00:18:53,250
Come on in, Ellie. Door's open.

216
00:18:57,833 --> 00:18:59,583
- Hello?
- You're not Ellie.

217
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:02,458
Uh, no. No, I'm not.

218
00:19:02,541 --> 00:19:04,421
No, it's just...
I thought you were my neighbor.

219
00:19:04,458 --> 00:19:06,083
Oh, sorry.

220
00:19:06,166 --> 00:19:07,333
You were here before, right?

221
00:19:07,416 --> 00:19:09,708
- You were across the street?
- Yeah. Yeah, that was me.

222
00:19:09,791 --> 00:19:11,708
I'm not some kind of
weird stalker or anything,

223
00:19:11,791 --> 00:19:13,458
if that's what you're thinking.

224
00:19:13,541 --> 00:19:16,750
No, I didn't think you were.
Could you close the door behind you?

225
00:19:16,833 --> 00:19:18,593
- Do you mind?
- Yeah, of course. Yeah, um...

226
00:19:20,250 --> 00:19:21,375
What can I do for you?

227
00:19:21,458 --> 00:19:24,083
Hey. He's cute. Good boy.

228
00:19:24,166 --> 00:19:26,458
Girl, actually. That's Ava.

229
00:19:26,541 --> 00:19:28,416
Cool name. Hey, Ava.

230
00:19:29,125 --> 00:19:30,125
Um...

231
00:19:31,000 --> 00:19:32,958
This is the Turner residence, right?

232
00:19:33,041 --> 00:19:36,291
Sort of. Sort of.
Uh, I'm Jake Turner.

233
00:19:36,375 --> 00:19:38,500
Great. Nice to meet you, Mr. Turner.

234
00:19:38,583 --> 00:19:41,250
My name's Rachel Campbell.
And the reason I'm here...

235
00:19:43,750 --> 00:19:47,833
Sorry, this is a little complicated,
but I'm trying to find my mother.

236
00:19:49,041 --> 00:19:51,708
And I think you might be able to help me.

237
00:19:52,500 --> 00:19:55,416
She used to live here
a long time ago, I think. I hope.

238
00:19:55,500 --> 00:19:57,291
Your mother lived here in this house?

239
00:19:57,375 --> 00:19:58,708
Yeah, um, when I was born...

240
00:19:58,791 --> 00:20:00,583
Rather, right before I was born,
she lived...

241
00:20:01,458 --> 00:20:04,458
This is Scott
and Lois Turner's house, right?

242
00:20:04,541 --> 00:20:08,541
Yeah. Uh, well, yeah. My parents.

243
00:20:08,625 --> 00:20:11,875
Great. So, yeah, my birth mother,
she lived here and she worked for them.

244
00:20:11,958 --> 00:20:13,375
Your mother worked for my parents?

245
00:20:13,458 --> 00:20:16,666
From what I can tell,
she was actually their nanny.

246
00:20:18,500 --> 00:20:20,458
Um...

247
00:20:21,083 --> 00:20:24,250
Whoa! No! Oh, whoa, whoa! No, no, no!
Okay, hold on! Hold...

248
00:20:24,333 --> 00:20:25,416
Ow! That's hot.

249
00:20:25,500 --> 00:20:27,333
You need a hand?

250
00:20:27,416 --> 00:20:28,666
No, no, it's...

251
00:20:28,750 --> 00:20:30,375
- I got it under control.
- Okay.

252
00:20:30,458 --> 00:20:32,250
- Ah, forget it.
- Okay.

253
00:20:33,916 --> 00:20:36,625
So what brings Nancy Drew
to the Turner house, anyway?

254
00:20:36,708 --> 00:20:38,416
If you don't mind me asking.

255
00:20:38,500 --> 00:20:40,916
It wasn't easy.
My adoption file was sealed.

256
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:43,640
But a friend of mine worked
for the Connecticut Records Department.

257
00:20:43,708 --> 00:20:45,388
By law, he couldn't tell me my mom's name,

258
00:20:45,416 --> 00:20:49,041
but he could tell me
her last known address which was here, so...

259
00:20:49,541 --> 00:20:52,583
I understand, but I'm sorry. I'm sorry, I...

260
00:20:52,666 --> 00:20:55,708
I was just about ready to head out.
I wish I could help you.

261
00:20:55,791 --> 00:20:58,291
- I don't think I can, though.
- No, I totally understand.

262
00:20:58,375 --> 00:21:01,333
I guess I just gotta
learn to leave the table.

263
00:21:02,958 --> 00:21:04,166
Nina Simone.

264
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:06,708
That's right. Yeah, she's the best.

265
00:21:07,791 --> 00:21:10,208
- One of your favorites?
- She is.

266
00:21:10,291 --> 00:21:15,500
- You got any others?
- Uh, Peggy Lee, Ella, Lady Day.

267
00:21:15,583 --> 00:21:17,791
- Aretha.
- Mmm. Oh, don't forget about Gladys.

268
00:21:17,875 --> 00:21:20,750
Oh, Gladys the Baddest. My dad...

269
00:21:21,791 --> 00:21:24,416
He was my own personal musicologist,
taught me everybody.

270
00:21:24,500 --> 00:21:26,166
Like Little Richard, Marvin Gaye.

271
00:21:26,250 --> 00:21:28,875
- Marvin. We lost him when I was a kid.
- '84.

272
00:21:29,416 --> 00:21:32,625
- Yeah. Yep.
- You in music or something?

273
00:21:32,708 --> 00:21:34,666
No. No, no, I'm a...

274
00:21:34,750 --> 00:21:37,583
- I write a little bit.
- Really? Cool! Anything I know?

275
00:21:37,666 --> 00:21:40,666
Uh... You know, no, probably not.

276
00:21:40,750 --> 00:21:44,208
- No? Anything I'd like?
- No. No, probably not.

277
00:21:44,291 --> 00:21:46,375
- Struggling artist? I get it.
- Ah...

278
00:21:47,500 --> 00:21:50,583
Well, I guess we're all struggling
in one way or another, huh?

279
00:21:50,666 --> 00:21:52,125
Ain't that the truth.

280
00:21:52,208 --> 00:21:54,291
Listen, I'm sorry
I couldn't help you with your mom.

281
00:21:54,375 --> 00:21:56,500
Yeah. Don't apologize.

282
00:21:57,416 --> 00:22:00,583
Honestly, just being in the house
where she once lived makes me feel...

283
00:22:03,166 --> 00:22:05,226
I don't know...
...more connected to her somehow.

284
00:22:05,250 --> 00:22:06,333
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

285
00:22:06,833 --> 00:22:09,208
Anyway, thanks.

286
00:22:11,625 --> 00:22:14,208
- Um, thank you. Yeah.
- Oh.

287
00:22:14,291 --> 00:22:16,125
Oops. Merry Christmas.

288
00:22:16,208 --> 00:22:17,688
- Merry Christmas to you.
- Thank you.

289
00:22:21,750 --> 00:22:24,416
Wait, Ellie. Wait... Rachel!

290
00:22:25,833 --> 00:22:27,000
Rachel, wait!

291
00:22:40,291 --> 00:22:41,458
I have an idea.

292
00:22:46,291 --> 00:22:49,375
Thing is, my neighbor's been living
here for years, and I was thinking she...

293
00:22:49,458 --> 00:22:52,000
I feel the same way.

294
00:22:54,875 --> 00:22:56,208
Well, that was quick.

295
00:22:58,541 --> 00:22:59,375
What?

296
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:01,666
Uh, nothing. I'll explain later.

297
00:23:01,750 --> 00:23:04,125
Listen, why don't I, um,
give you my phone number?

298
00:23:04,208 --> 00:23:05,833
And then you can just text me tomorrow.

299
00:23:05,916 --> 00:23:08,642
- I'm sure I'll have spoken to her by then.
- Oh, that would be great.

300
00:23:08,666 --> 00:23:09,916
Actually, you know what? Um...

301
00:23:10,000 --> 00:23:11,750
I think I might
just wait until she's back.

302
00:23:11,833 --> 00:23:14,416
- I'll wait in my car.
- You sure? She might be a while.

303
00:23:14,500 --> 00:23:17,083
- I've come this far, so...
- Okay.

304
00:23:17,166 --> 00:23:18,458
- Okay.
- Yup.

305
00:23:18,541 --> 00:23:19,541
Thanks.

306
00:23:39,416 --> 00:23:40,416
- Hey.
- Hey.

307
00:23:41,625 --> 00:23:42,625
What's up?

308
00:23:43,375 --> 00:23:47,750
Are you hungry?
I was gonna grab a bite, if you're hungry.

309
00:23:48,583 --> 00:23:50,208
- Very cool.
- Mmm-hmm.

310
00:23:50,291 --> 00:23:52,333
- So is this an old haunt or...
- No.

311
00:23:52,416 --> 00:23:54,041
I haven't been here in years, actually,

312
00:23:54,125 --> 00:23:56,958
but my mom used to take me here a lot
when I was a kid.

313
00:23:57,041 --> 00:23:59,916
- She loved this place.
- I can see why. It's nice.

314
00:24:00,000 --> 00:24:02,166
- Welcome to Trattoria Toscana.
- Thank you.

315
00:24:02,250 --> 00:24:04,416
I am Vittorio.
May I share tonight's specials?

316
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:06,083
Sure. Thank you so much.

317
00:24:06,166 --> 00:24:08,208
- Ah, do you speak Italian?
- Oh, yes.

318
00:24:08,291 --> 00:24:10,041
Very good!

319
00:24:10,125 --> 00:24:12,375
For the first course,
I recommend the pumpkin tortelli.

320
00:24:12,458 --> 00:24:13,291
Mmm!

321
00:24:13,375 --> 00:24:15,666
Next, I would suggest
a nice baked sea bass.

322
00:24:15,750 --> 00:24:21,125
We prepare it very lightly with a drizzle
of olive oil, lemon, and rosemary.

323
00:24:21,208 --> 00:24:24,625
Mmm!

324
00:24:24,708 --> 00:24:26,541
Yes! Oh, no. No, no, no.

325
00:24:26,625 --> 00:24:30,666
Uh, I'll take the pasta of the day.

326
00:24:30,750 --> 00:24:31,916
- Good.
- Thank you.

327
00:24:32,000 --> 00:24:33,958
Could you repeat in English?

328
00:24:34,041 --> 00:24:37,208
No, no, it's... it's fine.
I'll just have whatever she's having.

329
00:24:37,291 --> 00:24:39,333
- Ah.
- Oh, and a glass of wine, please.

330
00:24:39,416 --> 00:24:40,875
- Do you want one?
- Uh, no, no.

331
00:24:40,958 --> 00:24:41,958
You sure?

332
00:24:43,958 --> 00:24:46,333
Two glasses
of classic Chianti please.

333
00:24:46,416 --> 00:24:49,750
- Very good.
- Oh, uh, um... Separate checks?

334
00:24:49,833 --> 00:24:51,750
- Ah, but of course. Yes.
- Thank you.

335
00:24:51,833 --> 00:24:54,958
- What's that last thing?
- Oh, it's, um...

336
00:24:55,041 --> 00:24:57,041
- Separate checks. Yeah.
- Separate checks?

337
00:24:57,125 --> 00:24:59,500
You're a writer
and I just want to respect that.

338
00:24:59,583 --> 00:25:03,041
Both of my parents are artists.
They make and sell their own jewelry.

339
00:25:03,125 --> 00:25:05,458
So as you can imagine, it's, uh...

340
00:25:05,541 --> 00:25:08,125
there have been times
when the bills have been challenging.

341
00:25:08,208 --> 00:25:09,500
So I figure it's better to...

342
00:25:09,583 --> 00:25:13,083
I'm sure you can understand
and appreciate that sometimes it's...

343
00:25:13,166 --> 00:25:17,041
- Thank you. I appreciate it. Nice of you.
- Yeah. Yeah, of course.

344
00:25:17,625 --> 00:25:19,666
So you speak fluent Italian.
How'd that happen?

345
00:25:19,750 --> 00:25:23,291
Well, actually,
I also speak French and German.

346
00:25:24,458 --> 00:25:25,500
Little bit of Mandarin.

347
00:25:25,583 --> 00:25:27,059
- You speak a little Mandarin?
- A bit.

348
00:25:27,083 --> 00:25:28,250
I kid you not!

349
00:25:28,333 --> 00:25:30,351
No, it's...
I'm a language major, so...

350
00:25:30,375 --> 00:25:32,708
- Got it. Cool. You don't hear that...
<i>- Grazie.</i>

351
00:25:32,791 --> 00:25:34,375
Thank you very much.

352
00:25:34,458 --> 00:25:37,333
Um, so how do you
while away the hours these days?

353
00:25:37,416 --> 00:25:41,083
Actually, I just applied for a job
as a translator at the UN.

354
00:25:41,166 --> 00:25:43,326
- It's a long shot.
- Long shot? Why is it a long shot?

355
00:25:43,958 --> 00:25:45,291
Isn't everything?

356
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:46,500
Mm.

357
00:25:47,916 --> 00:25:50,750
- Um, sorry, I should take this.
- Sure. No problem.

358
00:25:50,833 --> 00:25:52,166
- One second.
- Sure.

359
00:25:55,416 --> 00:25:58,041
I'll see you at the table, all right?
Welcome home, stranger!

360
00:25:59,416 --> 00:26:00,625
Dion, hey! How are you?

361
00:26:00,708 --> 00:26:03,333
- Man, how long has it been?
- It's been a while. 12th grade.

362
00:26:03,416 --> 00:26:06,333
Yeah, you disappeared.
Where did you go to college, anyway?

363
00:26:06,416 --> 00:26:09,708
You know, I didn't go. I ended up...
I went to Paris. School of life.

364
00:26:09,791 --> 00:26:11,583
Oh, that's right.
You look exactly the same.

365
00:26:12,916 --> 00:26:13,916
Only richer.

366
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:15,083
Ah...

367
00:26:15,958 --> 00:26:18,208
Is it true they're turning
your new book into a movie?

368
00:26:19,375 --> 00:26:21,208
I don't know.
I mean, this is what they say.

369
00:26:21,291 --> 00:26:24,875
- Hometown hero.
- Thank you very much. You're very kind.

370
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:27,708
- It's great seeing you, man.
- Good to see you.

371
00:26:31,500 --> 00:26:33,000
Sorry about that.

372
00:26:33,083 --> 00:26:35,500
- Where were we?
- We were, um...

373
00:26:36,166 --> 00:26:38,333
Potential job. UN. Long shot.

374
00:26:38,416 --> 00:26:39,500
Yeah, it's...

375
00:26:41,083 --> 00:26:45,083
I don't know, with this new job,
it could be challenging. I don't know.

376
00:26:45,166 --> 00:26:47,833
- We may have to move and it's just...
- "We"?

377
00:26:48,791 --> 00:26:50,416
Yeah, Alan and me.

378
00:26:50,958 --> 00:26:54,000
- And Alan is?
- Oh, God, sorry. Alan's my fiancé.

379
00:26:54,083 --> 00:26:55,166
Oh, you're engaged?

380
00:26:55,250 --> 00:26:56,833
Mmm-hmm. Yeah.

381
00:26:56,916 --> 00:26:59,250
Hey, congratulations. I love love.

382
00:26:59,333 --> 00:27:01,916
- Great. Thank you.
- Cheers. This is wonderful.

383
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:04,375
Um, we haven't set a date yet.

384
00:27:04,458 --> 00:27:07,958
And Alan wants to,
but if I do get this job, then...

385
00:27:10,250 --> 00:27:12,541
I don't... We'll just
have to figure it out, I guess.

386
00:27:12,625 --> 00:27:14,385
Haven't even looked
for engagement rings yet.

387
00:27:14,416 --> 00:27:17,833
Well, we went last week, and I don't know,
I couldn't pick anything.

388
00:27:17,916 --> 00:27:20,750
So I just... we just left and then...

389
00:27:20,833 --> 00:27:25,083
Actually, this was kind of cute.
On the walk home, he gave me this.

390
00:27:26,791 --> 00:27:28,208
- What's that?
- It's...

391
00:27:31,166 --> 00:27:32,208
Cigar ring.

392
00:27:33,208 --> 00:27:35,666
Believe it or not,
this silly ring came as kind of a relief.

393
00:27:35,750 --> 00:27:36,958
- Yeah?
- I'm not into all that

394
00:27:37,041 --> 00:27:39,083
"Diamonds Are a Girl's Best Friend"
kind of stuff.

395
00:27:39,166 --> 00:27:44,083
The truth is I'm kind of ambivalent
about the concept of being engaged.

396
00:27:44,166 --> 00:27:46,208
- Mmm-hmm.
- One the one hand, I like the certainty,

397
00:27:46,291 --> 00:27:49,208
but on the other, it makes you feel
kind of boxed in, you know?

398
00:27:49,291 --> 00:27:52,958
Yeah, no, "boxed in" is something
I've managed to avoid my entire life.

399
00:27:54,250 --> 00:27:57,125
In my case, it's tricky 'cause
Alan likes doing things by the book.

400
00:27:57,208 --> 00:28:00,416
And it's important to respect
what the other person wants. Right?

401
00:28:00,500 --> 00:28:01,940
- Mmm-hmm.
- But he's a tax attorney!

402
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:04,833
He's very, very good at his job,
and he's super precise.

403
00:28:04,916 --> 00:28:07,333
Believe me, he'll be the one
planning our wedding

404
00:28:07,416 --> 00:28:08,791
down to the very last place card.

405
00:28:08,875 --> 00:28:10,708
It's gonna run like clockwork.

406
00:28:10,791 --> 00:28:12,875
And the good thing is,
then I promise I'll shut up,

407
00:28:12,958 --> 00:28:15,791
but I think, I don't know,
Alan and I complement one another.

408
00:28:15,875 --> 00:28:18,958
And that's how it's...
It's supposed to be like that, right?

409
00:28:19,041 --> 00:28:22,250
I mean, I'm not an expert on the subject,
but, yeah, that sounds about right.

410
00:28:22,333 --> 00:28:24,000
Well, for better or worse, I am.

411
00:28:24,958 --> 00:28:26,958
I don't know,
I think being adopted, I'm just...

412
00:28:28,750 --> 00:28:31,333
I'm always trying
to fill some kind of void.

413
00:28:31,416 --> 00:28:34,291
I'm always looking
for security and reliability,

414
00:28:34,875 --> 00:28:38,625
and that's why I think if I find my real...
my birth mom, it's...

415
00:28:40,791 --> 00:28:44,250
I don't know, it'll resolve this
huge uncertainty in my life and then...

416
00:28:46,000 --> 00:28:47,833
- I don't know.
- You'll be free.

417
00:28:50,166 --> 00:28:51,333
- Yeah.
- Come on.

418
00:28:54,458 --> 00:28:57,083
Honestly, I really
would have been happy to split it.

419
00:28:57,166 --> 00:28:58,916
Oh, come on.
No, it was my pleasure.

420
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:00,208
Good food, good company.

421
00:29:04,250 --> 00:29:05,083
Huh.

422
00:29:05,166 --> 00:29:07,083
That's a three-hour date.

423
00:29:07,166 --> 00:29:09,625
I guess the universe
really does reward the brave.

424
00:29:12,541 --> 00:29:14,791
I should probably
tackle another room.

425
00:29:14,875 --> 00:29:15,875
Ah.

426
00:29:17,083 --> 00:29:19,958
Hey, um, I was actually wondering,
do you think there's a...

427
00:29:20,750 --> 00:29:24,333
there's a chance your parents
kept something of my mother's?

428
00:29:25,208 --> 00:29:26,625
A card? A photo?

429
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,000
Anything?

430
00:29:30,500 --> 00:29:32,340
- Yeah. Okay.
- Be careful now.

431
00:29:32,416 --> 00:29:34,216
- You got it? All right.
- Yeah. Okay.

432
00:29:34,250 --> 00:29:36,500
- Plop it right here's fine.
- Oh, God.

433
00:29:37,708 --> 00:29:41,375
- Is there a dead body in there?
- I'm afraid to look to be honest with you.

434
00:29:43,375 --> 00:29:45,000
- Hey, who played?
- Huh?

435
00:29:45,875 --> 00:29:48,375
Oh, my mom forced me
to take lessons when I was a kid.

436
00:29:48,458 --> 00:29:50,875
- At first, I pretty much hated it.
- And then?

437
00:29:50,958 --> 00:29:53,625
Then it made her
really happy to hear me play, so...

438
00:29:54,625 --> 00:29:56,041
Will you play something for me?

439
00:29:58,083 --> 00:30:00,017
- Play something for you? Come on. No.
- Seriously.

440
00:30:00,041 --> 00:30:03,041
Seriously, I wanna see if the piano
sounds as beautiful as it looks.

441
00:30:04,333 --> 00:30:05,333
Please?

442
00:30:06,375 --> 00:30:10,083
All right. It's been a while,
so I'm probably a little rusty.

443
00:30:19,875 --> 00:30:21,666
Hmm.

Ah! Young love.

456
00:32:56,541 --> 00:32:58,375
- Hi!
- So how was the date?

457
00:32:58,458 --> 00:32:59,958
It went well.

458
00:33:00,458 --> 00:33:01,458
Just well?

459
00:33:01,916 --> 00:33:03,125
It went very well.

460
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,000
Hmm!

461
00:33:05,458 --> 00:33:06,750
This is my friend, Rachel.

462
00:33:06,833 --> 00:33:08,273
- Hi!
- Hi, nice to meet you.

463
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:11,041
Rachel's got a question
I think maybe only you can answer<i>.</i>

464
00:33:12,416 --> 00:33:13,958
Of course, I remember her.

465
00:33:14,041 --> 00:33:17,291
She was a babysitter,
a live-in babysitter,

466
00:33:17,375 --> 00:33:19,041
like, you know, like an au pair.

467
00:33:19,125 --> 00:33:20,541
Right. Right, sure.

468
00:33:20,625 --> 00:33:25,833
She was very young.
Seventeen, maybe 18 at the most.

469
00:33:25,916 --> 00:33:29,125
She must have moved
before the baby was born.

470
00:33:29,208 --> 00:33:31,208
Do you remember her name or...

471
00:33:31,291 --> 00:33:32,958
Gosh, that's a good question.

472
00:33:33,041 --> 00:33:36,208
Seems like it had something
to do with Christmas,

473
00:33:36,291 --> 00:33:39,166
like, um, Christina or Joy.

474
00:33:39,250 --> 00:33:42,333
I'm drawing a blank,
but you know who would know?

475
00:33:42,416 --> 00:33:44,375
- Who's that?
- Your dad.

476
00:33:47,333 --> 00:33:49,083
Oh. Oh, no.

477
00:33:49,166 --> 00:33:51,208
No, I don't, um... No.

478
00:33:51,291 --> 00:33:53,666
Well, anyway, he lives in Vermont now.

479
00:33:53,750 --> 00:33:57,000
It's way up in the mountains
in a little town called Cornwall Bridge,

480
00:33:57,083 --> 00:33:58,916
living pretty much off the grid.

481
00:33:59,000 --> 00:34:00,958
How do you...
How do you know all that?

482
00:34:01,041 --> 00:34:04,041
When I saw him at the funeral,
we had a nice long chat.

483
00:34:04,125 --> 00:34:06,958
You know, I really don't think
there would be any harm in talking...

484
00:34:07,041 --> 00:34:08,791
"Harm in talking"? No, there will be harm.

485
00:34:08,875 --> 00:34:11,333
I haven't spoken to the guy in 35 years,
Ellie, come on.

486
00:34:11,416 --> 00:34:13,291
No, I'm aware, but...

487
00:34:13,375 --> 00:34:16,916
No, no, no. I'm... Excuse me.

488
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:22,416
Sorry. It's, uh...

489
00:34:23,708 --> 00:34:25,375
Oh, Jacob.

490
00:34:26,083 --> 00:34:28,083
Now you know why he stayed away so long.

491
00:34:29,291 --> 00:34:31,708
It would be good for him
if he could get over it.

492
00:34:41,791 --> 00:34:44,625
- Rachel! Rachel, wait!
- What?

493
00:34:48,291 --> 00:34:49,541
- Listen.
- Yeah?

494
00:34:49,625 --> 00:34:53,125
I know all that stuff in there
with my dad probably seemed irrational.

495
00:34:53,208 --> 00:34:55,833
Oh, no, Jake, please.
You don't owe me any explanation, okay?

496
00:34:55,916 --> 00:34:58,017
I'm just some stranger
who showed up on your doorstep.

497
00:34:58,041 --> 00:34:59,333
You don't owe me anything.

498
00:34:59,416 --> 00:35:03,791
You've already helped me, like, a lot.
So thank you. And...

499
00:35:04,791 --> 00:35:08,000
I really hope you have a lovely...
a lovely Christmas.

500
00:35:08,708 --> 00:35:09,708
You headed home?

501
00:35:11,416 --> 00:35:12,416
Um...

502
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:15,166
No, I'm going to Cornwall Bridge.

503
00:35:16,375 --> 00:35:20,708
I need to know if I ever mattered to her.
Maybe you've wondered that about your dad?

504
00:35:21,875 --> 00:35:24,500
Truth is, if I ever saw him,
I wouldn't know what to say to him.

505
00:35:26,166 --> 00:35:28,333
Well, maybe if you're up for a drive,

506
00:35:29,833 --> 00:35:31,541
we could script a few lines.

507
00:35:35,541 --> 00:35:36,541
Come on.

508
00:35:44,041 --> 00:35:45,041
Hop on up.

509
00:35:45,833 --> 00:35:50,250
You're leaving!
I guess it's, uh, time to head home?

510
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:53,583
Well, yes and no, actually.

511
00:35:55,166 --> 00:35:58,875
- How you doing? Jake Turner. Pleasure.
- Oh, Ian Page. Pleased to meet you.

512
00:35:58,958 --> 00:36:01,916
- I'm a big fan of your work, really.
- Oh, thank you.

513
00:36:02,000 --> 00:36:05,083
I told Ian that you
basically wrote my profile.

514
00:36:05,166 --> 00:36:08,083
Ah, well, you know,
she made me take out all the racy stuff.

515
00:36:08,166 --> 00:36:10,500
Well, all's I can say
is meeting Eleanor

516
00:36:10,583 --> 00:36:12,750
is the greatest Christmas surprise
I could ask for.

517
00:36:12,833 --> 00:36:13,666
Aw.

518
00:36:13,750 --> 00:36:17,083
Ian plays first violin
with the Hartford Symphony.

519
00:36:17,166 --> 00:36:18,791
Is that right? That's impressive.

520
00:36:18,875 --> 00:36:20,075
- That's great.
- Thanks, mate.

521
00:36:20,125 --> 00:36:23,250
What did you mean when you
said you were leaving, "Yes and no"?

522
00:36:23,750 --> 00:36:26,583
Yes, I'm leaving. No, I'm not going home.

523
00:36:26,666 --> 00:36:27,958
Uh, Rachel's supposed to be...

524
00:36:28,041 --> 00:36:29,500
- Oh, there she is. Hey.
- Hey.

525
00:36:30,083 --> 00:36:32,375
She's convinced me... And you, uh...

526
00:36:33,541 --> 00:36:35,083
I'm gonna go see my dad.

527
00:36:35,666 --> 00:36:36,666
Jacob.

528
00:36:37,416 --> 00:36:38,791
Good for you.

529
00:36:38,875 --> 00:36:42,250
Well, the universe
rewards the brave, right?

530
00:36:45,875 --> 00:36:46,875
You ready for this?

531
00:36:47,541 --> 00:36:49,541
Absolutely not. You?

532
00:36:50,458 --> 00:36:51,458
No.

533
00:36:52,083 --> 00:36:52,958
Let's go.

534
00:36:53,041 --> 00:36:57,291
<i>♪ Sha la da la la ♪</i>

535
00:36:57,375 --> 00:36:58,791
<i>♪ Christmas time ♪</i>

536
00:36:59,791 --> 00:37:04,041
<i>♪ Sha la da la la ♪</i>

537
00:37:04,125 --> 00:37:05,041
<i>♪ Christmas time... ♪</i>

538
00:37:05,125 --> 00:37:06,916
Don't you think
Waze would be easier?

539
00:37:07,000 --> 00:37:10,708
Yeah, of course it would.
But maps are so much nicer, it's like a...

540
00:37:10,791 --> 00:37:13,208
tactile thing in a virtual world,
you know?

541
00:37:13,291 --> 00:37:17,416
Yeah, I know. I had this idea...
I had this idea for a book about that.

542
00:37:17,500 --> 00:37:20,208
- A Stephen King thriller-type thing.
- Yeah?

543
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:23,750
Yeah, yeah, so here's what I came up with.
There's this couple, right?

544
00:37:23,833 --> 00:37:25,273
- They're on their honeymoon.
- Okay.

545
00:37:25,333 --> 00:37:27,000
And they're in a rental car.

546
00:37:27,083 --> 00:37:31,416
The GPS is, like, possessed or something,
or maybe the ex-boyfriend hacked into it.

547
00:37:32,416 --> 00:37:34,583
That might be better, I'm not sure.
Anyway.

548
00:37:34,666 --> 00:37:37,500
Whatever the case,
the GPS leads them into mortal danger.

549
00:37:39,541 --> 00:37:41,916
You hate it. Bad? It's bad.

550
00:37:42,000 --> 00:37:44,208
No, no, no!
You know, I like it. I like it.

551
00:37:44,791 --> 00:37:46,958
But what happens next?

552
00:37:47,041 --> 00:37:49,500
I mean, like,
after they're in mortal danger.

553
00:37:49,583 --> 00:37:51,833
Yeah, I don't... That's as far as I got.
Never wrote it.

554
00:37:51,916 --> 00:37:53,500
- All right.
- That's it.

555
00:37:53,583 --> 00:37:56,083
Well, as my dad said,
"No creative idea's ever wasted."

556
00:37:56,166 --> 00:37:57,791
- So there you go.
- I like that.

557
00:37:57,875 --> 00:38:00,958
Okay, in three miles,
take I-91 North.

558
00:38:01,041 --> 00:38:02,750
- 91 North. You got it.
- Yup.

559
00:38:03,500 --> 00:38:06,333
Alan always gets kind of
annoyed when I give him directions.

560
00:38:06,416 --> 00:38:08,625
- Really?
- He says he doesn't need a co-pilot.

561
00:38:08,708 --> 00:38:10,458
I could use
any navigational help I can get.

562
00:38:11,833 --> 00:38:13,666
Speaking of Alan,

563
00:38:13,750 --> 00:38:17,666
what's he think about this, um,
this job you applied for in New York?

564
00:38:17,750 --> 00:38:19,166
Um, actually, I, uh...

565
00:38:19,250 --> 00:38:21,666
He doesn't...
I haven't told him about it yet.

566
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:24,500
What's he think
about this trip to Cornwall Bridge?

567
00:38:24,541 --> 00:38:26,791
Uh, he's not thrilled. He's not thrilled.

568
00:38:26,875 --> 00:38:29,708
And actually he was kind of... peeved.

569
00:38:31,541 --> 00:38:33,791
Yeah. No, let me guess, it's, uh...

570
00:38:33,875 --> 00:38:36,750
He's upset that you are taking
a road trip with this guy you just met?

571
00:38:36,833 --> 00:38:40,166
No, actually. No, it was, um...

572
00:38:42,166 --> 00:38:44,875
It was about the... the gas money.

573
00:38:46,041 --> 00:38:48,125
No, it's just like
one of those little Alan quirks.

574
00:38:48,208 --> 00:38:49,291
Okay.

575
00:38:49,375 --> 00:38:53,208
It's no big deal, and in the grand scheme
of things, it's meaningless, right?

576
00:38:53,291 --> 00:38:56,750
I'm kind of insulted.
He's not concerned about me, right?

577
00:38:56,833 --> 00:38:59,513
- He's concerned about gas money.
- Well, he doesn't know about you.

578
00:39:01,625 --> 00:39:02,625
Oh.

579
00:39:03,958 --> 00:39:06,476
As it turns out,
I didn't really know about you either.

580
00:39:06,500 --> 00:39:09,226
- What are you talking about?
- I finally broke down and I Googled you.

581
00:39:09,250 --> 00:39:12,125
- Oh, come on.
- And, honestly, I tried to put it off.

582
00:39:12,208 --> 00:39:14,083
Because I really don't like
looking people up.

583
00:39:14,166 --> 00:39:15,916
It always seems
like an intrusion, somehow.

584
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,791
- Uh-huh.
- But now... I'm really glad I did.

585
00:39:18,875 --> 00:39:20,541
- No.
- 'Cause now I know you're this,

586
00:39:20,625 --> 00:39:23,708
like, super-famous,
best-selling novelist, so...

587
00:39:23,791 --> 00:39:25,833
Uh, super famous
is a bit of a stretch, I think.

588
00:39:25,916 --> 00:39:28,125
Well, um, five million copies sold...

589
00:39:28,208 --> 00:39:31,008
It's like five and a half at this point,
but it's okay, who's counting?

590
00:39:31,083 --> 00:39:33,203
And number one
on <i>The New York Times </i>Best Seller List.

591
00:39:33,250 --> 00:39:37,000
- I got lucky.
- And, uh, translated into 30 languages.

592
00:39:37,083 --> 00:39:40,083
- I think that makes you super famous.
- Oh.

593
00:39:42,666 --> 00:39:46,166
Here was little old me worried
about how you were gonna pay for dinner.

594
00:39:52,500 --> 00:39:56,333
Hey, do you mind grabbing my wallet?
It's in the backpack in the back there.

595
00:39:56,416 --> 00:39:57,416
Sure.

596
00:40:00,750 --> 00:40:01,750
Oh!

597
00:40:05,875 --> 00:40:07,250
- Thank you very much.
- Mmm-hmm.

598
00:40:32,000 --> 00:40:34,333
Jake, do you know what this is?

599
00:40:34,416 --> 00:40:36,250
No. You know what? I just, uh...

600
00:40:36,333 --> 00:40:38,291
That was in a box
marked "personal" at my mom's.

601
00:40:38,375 --> 00:40:41,625
I just kinda picked it up,
and I didn't look at it. What is it?

602
00:40:43,625 --> 00:40:45,916
Okay, listen to this.

603
00:40:48,416 --> 00:40:49,916
"My name is Noel Ellis."

604
00:40:51,500 --> 00:40:54,000
<i>"I'm 17 years old, and I'm having a baby."</i>

605
00:40:56,125 --> 00:40:57,666
This is my mother's diary.

606
00:40:59,000 --> 00:41:00,000
I know it.

607
00:41:00,541 --> 00:41:01,541
I know it.

608
00:41:02,958 --> 00:41:06,291
Her name is Noel. I can't believe this.

609
00:41:06,375 --> 00:41:09,625
I can't...
I just... I can't...

610
00:41:12,333 --> 00:41:14,833
"My parents sent me away to have my baby."

611
00:41:15,625 --> 00:41:16,875
"They're ashamed of me."

612
00:41:16,958 --> 00:41:20,083
<i>And they're ashamed
of the child I'm bringing into this world.</i>

613
00:41:20,666 --> 00:41:22,500
<i>And so, I'm leaving.</i>

614
00:41:22,583 --> 00:41:26,291
"They truly believe it's wrong for a woman
to have a child outside of marriage."

615
00:41:27,291 --> 00:41:29,000
"'God disapproves, ' they say."

616
00:41:29,583 --> 00:41:32,416
<i>But doesn't God
forgive our mistakes?</i>

617
00:41:35,375 --> 00:41:38,250
<i>Everyone I know and trust
has abandoned me.</i>

618
00:41:41,708 --> 00:41:44,791
"Thankfully, this really kind family
hired me as their nanny."

619
00:41:45,791 --> 00:41:48,166
<i>The Turners are a family of four.</i>

620
00:41:49,125 --> 00:41:53,833
<i>"Scott and Lois and
their little boys, Benjamin and Jacob."</i>

621
00:41:58,291 --> 00:42:01,125
<i>Benji's seven
and has loads of energy.</i>

622
00:42:02,625 --> 00:42:06,083
<i>Jake is four, and he's the quiet one.</i>

623
00:42:06,666 --> 00:42:10,666
Do you have any memory of that?
I know you were little, but...

624
00:42:11,708 --> 00:42:12,708
I really don't.

625
00:42:13,500 --> 00:42:16,625
<i>He likes me to read
the </i>Magic Tree House<i> books to him.</i>

626
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:21,291
So where's Ben now?

627
00:42:25,875 --> 00:42:28,166
Oh, there was this, um,

628
00:42:29,458 --> 00:42:31,625
snowstorm. It was around Christmas.

629
00:42:32,125 --> 00:42:33,125
We had...

630
00:42:33,458 --> 00:42:35,791
We had this giant elm tree
in our front yard.

631
00:42:35,875 --> 00:42:39,333
Benji loved to climb
and he was in that tree all the time.

632
00:42:40,833 --> 00:42:42,291
And that night,

633
00:42:42,375 --> 00:42:45,916
Ben decided he was gonna climb
as high as he could in that tree.

634
00:42:46,583 --> 00:42:48,416
And hang his favorite ornament...

635
00:43:29,041 --> 00:43:30,875
<i>♪ Don't know why ♪</i>

636
00:43:30,958 --> 00:43:36,166
<i>♪ There's no sun up in the sky
Stormy weather... ♪</i>

637
00:43:40,000 --> 00:43:42,750
Sorry about earlier, I got so emotional
talking about my brother.

638
00:43:42,833 --> 00:43:43,833
No, it's...

639
00:43:43,916 --> 00:43:46,333
You don't need to apologize. I understand.

640
00:43:46,916 --> 00:43:47,916
Thanks.

641
00:43:48,458 --> 00:43:51,541
It's been over 30 years, you know?
You'd think I'd be able to...

642
00:43:52,375 --> 00:43:53,375
talk about it.

643
00:43:54,375 --> 00:43:57,250
You know that saying,
"Time heals all wounds"?

644
00:43:57,333 --> 00:43:58,583
Mmm.

645
00:44:01,375 --> 00:44:02,500
It doesn't.

646
00:44:09,541 --> 00:44:11,958
<i>It's been two months now,</i>

647
00:44:12,041 --> 00:44:17,208
<i>and I still haven't heard a word
from either of my parents or Peter.</i>

648
00:44:17,291 --> 00:44:20,000
<i>"One day in my room,
I just couldn't stop crying..."</i>

649
00:44:20,083 --> 00:44:23,000
<i>And there was
this quiet knock on the door.</i>

650
00:44:23,083 --> 00:44:24,916
"And little Jacob came in."

651
00:44:26,250 --> 00:44:30,625
<i>He laid his head on my shoulder,
and it was as if he understood.</i>

652
00:44:32,875 --> 00:44:35,541
<i>I love that kid more and more every day.</i>

653
00:44:42,458 --> 00:44:46,250
<i>I know you're not supposed
to have favorites, but...</i>

654
00:44:47,083 --> 00:44:48,916
One New York, rare,

655
00:44:49,500 --> 00:44:53,416
and one vegetarian plate, no peppers,
no carrots, no onions, sauce on the side.

656
00:44:54,000 --> 00:44:55,583
Thank you. Perfect.

657
00:44:57,250 --> 00:44:59,375
- Hey, can I ask you a question?
- Can I stop you?

658
00:44:59,458 --> 00:45:00,625
No.

659
00:45:01,708 --> 00:45:05,625
Why is it that a handsome,
successful guy like you is still single?

660
00:45:05,708 --> 00:45:07,708
- Handsome?
- Don't deflect.

661
00:45:08,750 --> 00:45:09,750
Uh...

662
00:45:10,791 --> 00:45:14,333
- I like to be alone, I guess, you know?
- Hmm. Safer that way. I get it.

663
00:45:16,166 --> 00:45:17,375
But you're engaged.

664
00:45:17,458 --> 00:45:20,583
Still, there's always that,
like, push-pull thing, you know?

665
00:45:20,666 --> 00:45:21,875
- Mmm.
- "Come closer."

666
00:45:21,958 --> 00:45:24,416
- "I want to be alone." You know?
- Mmm-hmm.

667
00:45:24,500 --> 00:45:27,708
I mean, I've had relationships
in the past, don't get me wrong.

668
00:45:27,791 --> 00:45:30,666
I've had serious relationships
in the past, a few of them anyway, but...

669
00:45:31,166 --> 00:45:33,166
You know, in the end, they all just, uh...

670
00:45:37,500 --> 00:45:41,208
In the end, I just wasn't
what they were looking for, you know?

671
00:45:42,958 --> 00:45:44,958
Maybe they weren't
what you were looking for.

672
00:45:49,458 --> 00:45:50,666
Uh, question.

673
00:45:50,750 --> 00:45:53,517
What are the odds of us making it
through the pass before the storm hits?

674
00:45:53,541 --> 00:45:54,916
- Tonight?
- Yeah.

675
00:45:55,000 --> 00:45:57,125
Ooh, I'd say about...

676
00:45:58,333 --> 00:45:59,208
zero.

677
00:45:59,291 --> 00:46:01,000
- Percent?
- Percent.

678
00:46:07,416 --> 00:46:10,333
Why don't you check us in?
I think Ava needs to stretch her legs.

679
00:46:10,416 --> 00:46:12,016
- Sure! Meet you back here in 20?
- Yeah.

680
00:46:12,083 --> 00:46:13,083
All right.

681
00:46:20,958 --> 00:46:21,958
Hey!

682
00:46:22,041 --> 00:46:23,458
<i>Hey, stranger.</i>

683
00:46:23,541 --> 00:46:26,500
<i>Look, I, uh, I wanted
to apologize for the other night.</i>

684
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,166
<i>I know this stuff with your mom,
trying to find her...</i>

685
00:46:29,250 --> 00:46:31,666
No, no, no, Alan. Don't worry.
Don't worry. It's fine.

686
00:46:31,750 --> 00:46:35,833
<i>Uh, so, listen,
on a forward-thinking note,</i>

687
00:46:35,916 --> 00:46:38,333
<i>I had an idea for our engagement party.</i>

688
00:46:38,416 --> 00:46:40,125
Yeah?

689
00:46:40,208 --> 00:46:43,583
<i>Yeah, you know that Mexican restaurant
you love, Casa Frida?</i>

690
00:46:43,666 --> 00:46:47,208
- Uh-huh.
<i>- So it's available Valentine's Day,</i>

691
00:46:47,291 --> 00:46:49,666
<i>which is perfect
for an engagement party, right?</i>

692
00:46:49,750 --> 00:46:52,208
<i>Plus, they are giving us
a phenomenal price.</i>

693
00:46:52,291 --> 00:46:53,500
Oh, that sounds great.

694
00:46:55,166 --> 00:46:56,000
<i>Yeah?</i>

695
00:46:56,083 --> 00:46:59,291
<i>So my plan is give them a deposit
first thing tomorrow morning.</i>

696
00:47:00,833 --> 00:47:02,333
Alan, can we just...

697
00:47:03,500 --> 00:47:05,333
Can we just wait on Casa Frida?

698
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:07,583
Till I get back.

699
00:47:07,666 --> 00:47:10,291
<i>Of course, babe. Yeah. Whatever you want.</i>

700
00:47:10,375 --> 00:47:11,375
<i>Um...</i>

701
00:47:11,916 --> 00:47:13,958
<i>- When are you back?</i>
- Soon.

702
00:47:15,375 --> 00:47:17,958
<i>Okay. Love you.</i>

703
00:47:18,958 --> 00:47:19,958
I love you too.

704
00:47:27,750 --> 00:47:30,041
You're in luck! Got two rooms left.

705
00:47:30,625 --> 00:47:31,750
Great! Terrific.

706
00:47:31,833 --> 00:47:34,375
You know, if this were a rom-com,
you'd have one room left.

707
00:47:34,458 --> 00:47:35,583
We'd have to share it.

708
00:47:36,333 --> 00:47:37,500
Rom-com?

709
00:47:37,583 --> 00:47:39,166
Romantic comedy, rom-com.

710
00:47:39,750 --> 00:47:41,875
- Oh, right!
- Yeah.

711
00:47:41,958 --> 00:47:43,833
Well, if it helps,

712
00:47:44,500 --> 00:47:45,708
the rooms are connected.

713
00:47:54,375 --> 00:47:56,000
Okay, I'm sorry, you're closing.

714
00:47:56,083 --> 00:47:58,541
I was gonna head to the pageant,
but it can wait.

715
00:47:58,625 --> 00:47:59,708
How can I help?

716
00:47:59,791 --> 00:48:02,416
I was wondering
if you had any books by Jacob Turner?

717
00:48:02,500 --> 00:48:05,458
Of course!
How far along are you in the series?

718
00:48:05,958 --> 00:48:08,958
Uh... I'm at the beginning, so I don't know.

719
00:48:09,041 --> 00:48:12,583
Okay! You want Book One,
<i>Green Eyes of Paris. </i>We should have that.

720
00:48:12,666 --> 00:48:15,125
Great! So what's it about?

721
00:48:15,208 --> 00:48:16,916
Paris in the '40s.

722
00:48:17,000 --> 00:48:20,250
The French Resistance,
espionage, forbidden love.

723
00:48:20,333 --> 00:48:22,375
Oh, wow. Sounds pretty...

724
00:48:22,458 --> 00:48:25,125
Riveting, right? And trust me, it is.

725
00:48:25,208 --> 00:48:26,583
The world this guy creates,

726
00:48:26,666 --> 00:48:29,666
it's like you're actually there
with his characters.

727
00:48:29,750 --> 00:48:31,500
It's what makes the book so absorbing.

728
00:48:31,583 --> 00:48:33,500
That's probably why I have
such a hard time

729
00:48:33,583 --> 00:48:35,000
keeping them on the shelves.

730
00:48:35,083 --> 00:48:37,916
Ah! Look at that, you're in luck.

731
00:48:38,791 --> 00:48:39,833
Thanks.

732
00:48:44,125 --> 00:48:45,000
Not bad.

733
00:48:45,083 --> 00:48:47,833
Yeah, and he writes
almost as good as he looks.

734
00:48:51,166 --> 00:48:52,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

735
00:48:52,416 --> 00:48:55,083
So, what do you think?
Should we call it a night, or...

736
00:48:56,500 --> 00:48:58,916
"Or." Definitely "or."

737
00:49:00,166 --> 00:49:02,208
Yeah! Yeah, yeah, come on.

738
00:49:07,083 --> 00:49:08,708
Merry Christmas!

739
00:49:09,500 --> 00:49:11,060
- There you are.
- Thank you.

740
00:49:21,208 --> 00:49:24,958
- Look at this.
- Look at this! Hi! So cute.

741
00:49:25,041 --> 00:49:27,375
You better knock it off.
She'll get jealous.

742
00:49:30,875 --> 00:49:32,642
- Incredible.
- I love it here.

743
00:49:32,666 --> 00:49:33,916
- How are you?
- Hi!

744
00:49:34,000 --> 00:49:35,851
- Do you mind if we have...
- Absolutely.

745
00:49:35,875 --> 00:49:38,351
- Thank you! You're giving these away?
- On the house.

746
00:49:38,375 --> 00:49:39,833
- Thank you!
- It's my favorite town.

747
00:49:39,916 --> 00:49:41,791
- Smells great.
- Happy holidays.

748
00:49:41,875 --> 00:49:44,916
Oh, wow, look at that!
I haven't seen this film in years.

749
00:49:45,000 --> 00:49:47,875
- I've never seen it.
- You're kidding. You're in for a treat.

750
00:49:51,750 --> 00:49:53,708
Excuse me, are you two together?

751
00:49:53,791 --> 00:49:54,875
Oh, no.

752
00:49:55,416 --> 00:49:57,708
Yeah? Well, yeah. We were, you know...

753
00:49:57,791 --> 00:49:58,833
Maybe we are.

754
00:49:59,625 --> 00:50:01,083
Smooth.

755
00:50:02,958 --> 00:50:03,791
You okay?

756
00:50:03,875 --> 00:50:07,083
<i>I'm shakin' the dust of this
crummy little town off my feet</i>

757
00:50:07,166 --> 00:50:08,750
<i>and I'm gonna see the world!</i>

758
00:50:08,833 --> 00:50:11,250
<i>Italy, Greece...</i>

759
00:50:26,125 --> 00:50:29,958
Wow! That may be
the best movie I've ever seen.

760
00:50:39,041 --> 00:50:44,416
<i>He wondered if this journey
was about to take an unexpected turn.</i>

761
00:50:47,000 --> 00:50:49,500
Oh, my God. No way.

762
00:50:58,291 --> 00:50:59,791
Everything okay in there?

763
00:51:01,458 --> 00:51:02,541
- Hi.
<i>- </i>Hi.

764
00:51:03,541 --> 00:51:04,541
Yeah, I'm fine.

765
00:51:05,958 --> 00:51:07,000
Great.

766
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,333
- I just... I heard... I thought I heard a...
- Oh, yeah, no.

767
00:51:12,416 --> 00:51:15,250
Thanks for checking, though.
Appreciate it.

768
00:51:15,333 --> 00:51:18,166
Okay. Just, uh...
Well, just have a...

769
00:51:18,250 --> 00:51:19,650
- Good night.
- Good night.

770
00:51:29,166 --> 00:51:30,750
No way!

771
00:51:50,666 --> 00:51:51,791
Oh!

772
00:52:13,041 --> 00:52:14,208
How'd you sleep?

773
00:52:14,291 --> 00:52:15,416
Um...

774
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:18,750
Actually,
I was up last night reading.

775
00:52:19,250 --> 00:52:21,541
- Anything interesting?
- Uh, yeah, very.

776
00:52:22,458 --> 00:52:24,625
- Yeah?
<i>- Green Eyes of Paris.</i>

777
00:52:24,708 --> 00:52:27,375
- You know that one?
- I've heard of it. You...

778
00:52:27,458 --> 00:52:29,791
You bought my book
and you didn't tell me?

779
00:52:29,875 --> 00:52:31,125
Yeah, well, I didn't...

780
00:52:31,208 --> 00:52:34,500
- I didn't wanna tell you just in case...
- Just in case what?

781
00:52:35,583 --> 00:52:37,125
In case I didn't like it.

782
00:52:37,750 --> 00:52:39,750
- In case you didn't like it?
- Yeah.

783
00:52:40,333 --> 00:52:41,333
And?

784
00:52:42,875 --> 00:52:43,875
Well...

785
00:52:44,708 --> 00:52:47,208
No, it's okay. You can tell me. It's fine.
My ego is, uh...

786
00:52:47,291 --> 00:52:48,833
I think I can handle it.

787
00:52:48,916 --> 00:52:51,583
- What's up? What did you think?
- Okay, well, um...

788
00:52:53,125 --> 00:52:55,708
- You know, I find it interesting...
- Yeah.

789
00:52:55,791 --> 00:53:01,916
...that you write these novels
filled with suspense, and drama, romance,

790
00:53:02,000 --> 00:53:04,125
and yet your main character, Henri,

791
00:53:04,208 --> 00:53:06,583
he never lets anyone get close to him.

792
00:53:07,708 --> 00:53:09,833
It's kinda like what we were
talking about last night.

793
00:53:10,583 --> 00:53:14,666
Henri lives in occupied France, right?
He can't trust anybody.

794
00:53:15,875 --> 00:53:17,083
Well, yeah, but...

795
00:53:21,250 --> 00:53:24,208
This isn't occupied America.
So what's your excuse?

796
00:53:28,500 --> 00:53:29,583
On the other hand...

797
00:53:30,458 --> 00:53:31,458
um...

798
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:34,375
- I really loved the book.
- Yeah?

799
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,666
I loved it! It was just...

800
00:53:37,291 --> 00:53:38,375
God, the ending?

801
00:53:39,125 --> 00:53:40,125
That was...

802
00:53:42,000 --> 00:53:43,458
It kind of blew me away.

803
00:53:44,208 --> 00:53:46,125
Good. Good, good, good.

804
00:53:46,208 --> 00:53:48,791
The endings are, uh... ending, it's...

805
00:53:48,875 --> 00:53:51,458
They're always hard to get right,
you know. Yeah.

806
00:53:52,166 --> 00:53:56,083
Any thoughts on the current story?
You gonna get that ending right?

807
00:54:07,625 --> 00:54:11,166
<i>I found out today
I'm having a girl,</i>

808
00:54:11,833 --> 00:54:14,041
<i>a sweet, little baby girl.</i>

809
00:54:14,916 --> 00:54:18,583
<i>Before I left home, my parents
told me not to name my baby.</i>

810
00:54:19,708 --> 00:54:22,666
"Because it would
only make it harder to say goodbye."

811
00:54:22,750 --> 00:54:25,375
"But I've already... given her a name."

812
00:54:31,500 --> 00:54:32,625
<i>My angel.</i>

813
00:54:37,583 --> 00:54:41,291
Um, can you pull over? I... I need...
I need some air.

814
00:54:41,375 --> 00:54:43,335
- You sure? It's freezing outside.
- Yeah, please.

815
00:54:43,416 --> 00:54:44,583
Okay. Sure.

816
00:54:57,666 --> 00:54:59,458
Hey. Come on.

817
00:55:00,583 --> 00:55:03,125
Ah! It's freezing out here. Here you go.

818
00:55:03,791 --> 00:55:04,791
You all right?

819
00:55:09,750 --> 00:55:11,750
Why would she leave it behind?

820
00:55:13,708 --> 00:55:16,125
Why go through the trouble
of writing everything down

821
00:55:16,208 --> 00:55:18,375
and documenting all these details
if she wasn't...

822
00:55:18,875 --> 00:55:20,583
if she was just gonna abandon it?

823
00:55:22,125 --> 00:55:22,958
I don't know.

824
00:55:23,041 --> 00:55:26,083
You know, maybe she thought it would
find its way back to you, eventually?

825
00:55:26,791 --> 00:55:29,125
Or maybe she just
wanted to forget everything.

826
00:55:30,125 --> 00:55:31,583
Like it never existed.

827
00:55:33,333 --> 00:55:35,208
- Like I never existed.
- No.

828
00:55:44,458 --> 00:55:48,125
I'm supposed to be engaged.
I'm supposed to be getting married.

829
00:55:57,291 --> 00:56:00,166
Oh, no! What are you... No, wait!

830
00:56:00,250 --> 00:56:01,930
- Come on! where are you... No!
- Ava? Ava!

831
00:56:02,541 --> 00:56:04,083
Ava!

832
00:56:04,166 --> 00:56:05,208
Ava, no!

833
00:56:05,291 --> 00:56:08,458
Ava Turner,
get back here right now!

834
00:56:18,625 --> 00:56:20,958
- What were you gonna do if you caught it?
- Yeah.

835
00:56:22,375 --> 00:56:24,208
That was incredible.

836
00:56:29,250 --> 00:56:31,666
Guess life's all about the chase,
huh, Turner?

837
00:57:01,000 --> 00:57:03,240
I think we took a wrong turn.

838
00:57:03,291 --> 00:57:06,291
- You mean you hope we took a wrong turn?
- Exactly.

839
00:57:24,458 --> 00:57:27,291
Please tell me
the universe really does reward the brave.

840
00:57:27,916 --> 00:57:28,916
You got this.

841
00:57:32,291 --> 00:57:33,791
Here we go.

842
00:58:11,166 --> 00:58:13,833
<i>It was a day
he had both been anticipating...</i>

843
00:58:16,333 --> 00:58:17,541
<i>and dreading.</i>

844
00:59:29,541 --> 00:59:30,541
Jacob.

845
00:59:35,083 --> 00:59:37,708
You know, Eleanor called
to say you might be coming.

846
00:59:38,375 --> 00:59:40,333
I told her I didn't believe it,

847
00:59:40,416 --> 00:59:43,708
but she said over and over again,
"Just be prepared."

848
00:59:45,000 --> 00:59:46,041
Are you?

849
00:59:48,458 --> 00:59:49,458
Yeah! I...

850
00:59:50,416 --> 00:59:52,666
I'm cutting down
this Christmas tree for you.

851
00:59:53,666 --> 00:59:57,291
I've only been waiting for this moment
for 30-odd years, and now that it's here...

852
01:00:02,000 --> 01:00:03,000
Yeah.

853
01:00:03,750 --> 01:00:04,750
Same.

854
01:00:15,416 --> 01:00:16,791
Mind giving me a hand?

855
01:00:19,375 --> 01:00:24,291
Plus, if it's just you,
what's the point, right?

856
01:00:24,375 --> 01:00:28,041
Yeah, well, if it's any
consolation, I've never had a tree,

857
01:00:28,125 --> 01:00:29,500
so you're ahead of me.

858
01:00:31,583 --> 01:00:34,458
All right.
Welcome to my humble abode.

859
01:00:35,583 --> 01:00:36,750
Here we go.

860
01:00:38,500 --> 01:00:40,958
- Now just set this end down here.
- Yeah.

861
01:00:41,041 --> 01:00:42,458
Can you tip it up?

862
01:00:43,250 --> 01:00:45,208
- Gotta get the stand.
- All right.

863
01:00:47,375 --> 01:00:49,833
- You live out here all alone?
- I do!

864
01:00:53,166 --> 01:00:55,416
- All right.
- Ellie painted that, right?

865
01:00:57,500 --> 01:00:59,500
Good eye. Yeah, that's hers.

866
01:01:01,041 --> 01:01:02,125
All right.

867
01:01:03,708 --> 01:01:05,750
- I think that should do it.
- Yeah?

868
01:01:06,916 --> 01:01:08,541
- Look at that.
- Good job.

869
01:01:08,625 --> 01:01:11,166
Oh. Excuse me.

870
01:01:14,125 --> 01:01:15,958
Scott Turner. Hello?

871
01:01:18,208 --> 01:01:19,208
Yes.

872
01:01:38,041 --> 01:01:39,208
See you then.

873
01:01:40,708 --> 01:01:42,041
Sorry about that.

874
01:01:42,791 --> 01:01:45,333
That was, uh, one of my clients.

875
01:01:46,333 --> 01:01:50,208
- Your clients? What do you do?
- I'm a social worker at the VA.

876
01:01:50,291 --> 01:01:52,541
Social, you're trying
to do some good in the world?

877
01:01:54,291 --> 01:01:55,416
Underline "trying."

878
01:01:57,458 --> 01:02:01,416
You know, I bought these
forever ago when I first moved in,

879
01:02:01,500 --> 01:02:04,083
and I never even took them out of the box.

880
01:02:04,791 --> 01:02:06,291
Think they still work?

881
01:02:08,000 --> 01:02:09,083
I don't know.

882
01:02:12,291 --> 01:02:13,333
Jake...

883
01:02:16,041 --> 01:02:18,601
I know an apology doesn't mean
a whole lot after all these years...

884
01:02:18,625 --> 01:02:19,750
You know what? It's...

885
01:02:20,916 --> 01:02:21,916
You can save it.

886
01:02:21,958 --> 01:02:25,500
I didn't come out here for a, uh,
you know, reconciliation.

887
01:02:25,583 --> 01:02:28,333
I'm only here to help a friend, honestly.

888
01:02:29,375 --> 01:02:32,666
- A friend?
- Yeah, a friend. It's a long story.

889
01:02:33,916 --> 01:02:38,458
Well, since you're here, can I at least
say what I've been waiting...

890
01:02:38,541 --> 01:02:41,291
I'd, I'd... I'd really rather you didn't.

891
01:02:41,875 --> 01:02:42,875
I am sorry.

892
01:02:48,416 --> 01:02:50,625
You're sorry.

893
01:02:50,708 --> 01:02:53,791
I am deeply, deeply sorry.

894
01:02:59,916 --> 01:03:01,208
Yeah. Good.

895
01:03:01,916 --> 01:03:03,375
Good. So we're all set then.

896
01:03:03,458 --> 01:03:04,833
You know, um,

897
01:03:05,625 --> 01:03:07,083
you left me alone with Mom,

898
01:03:07,166 --> 01:03:10,833
and then you run up here,
and you just disappear altogether...

899
01:03:10,916 --> 01:03:12,500
And you're sorry?

900
01:03:14,833 --> 01:03:18,166
God! I said I wasn't gonna do this.

901
01:03:18,750 --> 01:03:22,000
Uh, you know what?
This was a mistake. I can't do this.

902
01:03:22,083 --> 01:03:23,958
- Jake!
- Enjoy your tree.

903
01:03:29,375 --> 01:03:30,601
- Hey!
- No, I can't handle this.

904
01:03:30,625 --> 01:03:32,601
- I thought this was a good idea. Let's go.
- What?

905
01:03:32,625 --> 01:03:34,875
Wait, just take a breath, okay?
Take a breath.

906
01:03:35,375 --> 01:03:38,125
You know, if you walk away now,
that's it, right?

907
01:03:38,208 --> 01:03:39,541
It's over. Forever.

908
01:03:39,625 --> 01:03:42,708
- Well, it's been over for 35 years...
- Stop! Jake.

909
01:03:44,500 --> 01:03:45,541
If you leave now,

910
01:03:46,916 --> 01:03:48,875
you are doing exactly what he did.

911
01:03:49,875 --> 01:03:50,875
Right?

912
01:03:53,166 --> 01:03:57,166
Why don't you just try being the first
adult in your family not to take the exit?

913
01:04:02,625 --> 01:04:03,625
Please.

914
01:04:12,625 --> 01:04:16,208
Jake,
it's just so hard to talk about...

915
01:04:19,291 --> 01:04:21,541
but two days before Christmas,

916
01:04:22,250 --> 01:04:24,791
we had the biggest snowstorm
of the winter.

917
01:04:27,625 --> 01:04:30,125
<i>And Benji, like every year,</i>

918
01:04:30,208 --> 01:04:32,875
<i>couldn't wait
to hang his favorite ornament</i>

919
01:04:32,958 --> 01:04:35,250
<i>high up in the branches
of our old elm tree.</i>

920
01:04:38,041 --> 01:04:42,166
<i>He'd climbed up so many times to
that platform that I'd built for you guys.</i>

921
01:04:48,833 --> 01:04:50,083
Oh!

922
01:04:55,208 --> 01:04:57,791
<i>I knew the branches
could be slippery...</i>

923
01:05:00,916 --> 01:05:03,500
<i>but he was such a determined little guy.</i>

924
01:05:06,916 --> 01:05:09,916
<i>I thought,
"I'll just let him hang the ornament."</i>

925
01:05:13,583 --> 01:05:17,541
<i>The sound of that branch
cracking will never leave me.</i>

926
01:05:25,291 --> 01:05:26,666
<i>I was Benji's father.</i>

927
01:05:28,708 --> 01:05:30,291
<i>I should have stopped him.</i>

928
01:05:33,791 --> 01:05:35,000
The following April,

929
01:05:36,000 --> 01:05:37,583
<i>I cut down that tree.</i>

930
01:05:40,333 --> 01:05:41,916
It didn't help at all.

931
01:05:45,083 --> 01:05:46,916
And after Noel left,

932
01:05:48,208 --> 01:05:49,416
your mom and I just...

933
01:05:51,333 --> 01:05:53,166
couldn't comfort each other anymore.

934
01:05:55,250 --> 01:05:57,875
And it got to the point
where one of us had to leave.

935
01:06:00,166 --> 01:06:01,958
I wanted to take you with me,

936
01:06:03,208 --> 01:06:04,958
but I just couldn't do that to her.

937
01:06:05,458 --> 01:06:06,958
You were all she had left.

938
01:06:08,958 --> 01:06:12,625
I told myself that with you there,

939
01:06:14,708 --> 01:06:16,666
somehow she'd find her way back.

940
01:06:35,708 --> 01:06:39,125
You know, you used to love
stringing the lights when you were little.

941
01:06:40,458 --> 01:06:41,791
You remember?

942
01:06:51,583 --> 01:06:53,458
So, tell me, be honest,

943
01:06:55,458 --> 01:06:57,875
do you think we should go in
or just let them be?

944
01:07:05,375 --> 01:07:09,166
Okay, I guess we'll let them be.
Okay. I heard you.

945
01:07:13,250 --> 01:07:16,125
You know, I tried to stay in touch.

946
01:07:16,708 --> 01:07:21,208
At first, I called. Left messages for you.
For years, I wrote letters to you.

947
01:07:21,291 --> 01:07:24,625
I've never seen a letter or a message.
Mom never told me.

948
01:07:27,500 --> 01:07:31,458
- So are you married?
- Married? No, I'm not. No.

949
01:07:32,250 --> 01:07:34,000
I read your first couple of books.

950
01:07:34,083 --> 01:07:37,250
But my eyesight's not what it was,
so I listened to the third one on audio.

951
01:07:37,333 --> 01:07:40,083
I mean, it's the first time
I got to hear your adult voice.

952
01:07:40,166 --> 01:07:41,166
It was fantastic.

953
01:07:43,291 --> 01:07:44,625
I love 'em.

954
01:07:44,708 --> 01:07:46,166
Oh, I remember.

955
01:07:46,250 --> 01:07:49,083
I think Benji called you a butterfingers...

956
01:07:54,541 --> 01:07:58,083
<i>♪ Where the love light gleams... ♪</i>

957
01:08:01,916 --> 01:08:03,166
That's beautiful.

958
01:08:04,166 --> 01:08:05,166
Here's hoping.

959
01:08:08,125 --> 01:08:13,291
<i>♪ If only in my dreams... ♪</i>

960
01:08:15,541 --> 01:08:17,750
There you go.

961
01:08:17,833 --> 01:08:24,333
<i>♪ I'll be home for Christmas... ♪</i>

962
01:08:24,416 --> 01:08:26,208
Success!

963
01:08:27,166 --> 01:08:29,791
Didn't you say
you came here to help a friend?

964
01:08:32,833 --> 01:08:36,416
<i>♪ My dreams ♪</i>

965
01:08:36,500 --> 01:08:38,083
Hey. How's the weather?

966
01:08:38,750 --> 01:08:40,083
It's chili!

967
01:08:41,458 --> 01:08:42,458
Here it comes.

968
01:08:42,916 --> 01:08:46,125
Excuse me, girl. This is not for you.

969
01:08:46,875 --> 01:08:48,416
Noel was a godsend.

970
01:08:49,958 --> 01:08:51,833
After we lost Jacob's brother,

971
01:08:51,916 --> 01:08:55,166
she was the glue that kept us
from completely coming apart.

972
01:08:55,666 --> 01:08:57,166
- Here you go.
- Oh, thank you.

973
01:08:57,250 --> 01:08:59,333
Now, bear with me.

974
01:08:59,416 --> 01:09:01,708
I've been making
this chili for myself for 35 years,

975
01:09:01,791 --> 01:09:04,875
so I have no idea
if it's safe for public consumption.

976
01:09:04,958 --> 01:09:08,083
- Smells good. I'll tell you that.
- All right, son, here you go.

977
01:09:10,041 --> 01:09:11,041
Mmm.

978
01:09:11,791 --> 01:09:14,125
Oh, it's more than safe.
It's really good. Thank you.

979
01:09:14,208 --> 01:09:16,541
- Mmm. That's great.
- It's really great.

980
01:09:16,625 --> 01:09:17,708
Fantastic.

981
01:09:17,791 --> 01:09:19,791
So would you happen to know

982
01:09:19,875 --> 01:09:22,500
where Noel moved
or where she might live now?

983
01:09:23,041 --> 01:09:24,041
Oh...

984
01:09:24,458 --> 01:09:28,625
You know, she sent me
something years ago. Hold on.

985
01:09:28,708 --> 01:09:30,468
- Really?
- Excuse me, baby.

986
01:09:33,416 --> 01:09:35,083
What do you think?

987
01:09:35,166 --> 01:09:37,208
Um, you have his eyes.

988
01:09:38,416 --> 01:09:39,416
Really?

989
01:09:40,166 --> 01:09:41,166
Yeah.

990
01:09:41,875 --> 01:09:42,958
It's a good thing.

991
01:09:46,583 --> 01:09:47,583
Well...

992
01:09:53,041 --> 01:09:55,416
I, uh... Sorry.

993
01:09:56,125 --> 01:09:58,333
I always held on to this.
Don't ask me why.

994
01:10:03,916 --> 01:10:04,916
Uh...

995
01:10:19,666 --> 01:10:23,708
It says she's gonna be living with her
husband, Charles Hayden, in Ridgefield.

996
01:10:31,250 --> 01:10:32,500
Noel Hayden.

997
01:10:48,791 --> 01:10:52,083
I gotta say it.
You two would make a fantastic couple.

998
01:10:53,250 --> 01:10:55,708
- No, no, Rachel's engaged.
- Yeah.

999
01:10:55,791 --> 01:10:57,208
- Really?
- Yeah, big time.

1000
01:10:58,541 --> 01:11:00,250
- Congratulations.
- Thank you.

1001
01:11:00,833 --> 01:11:03,916
He must be a great guy
because you are one heck of a catch.

1002
01:11:04,000 --> 01:11:06,291
- That she is.
- Okay.

1003
01:11:06,375 --> 01:11:10,041
So, you'll let me know
how everything turns out?

1004
01:11:10,125 --> 01:11:14,250
Oh, of course. Of course.
Thank you. Thank you so much.

1005
01:11:14,333 --> 01:11:15,958
You're welcome, sweetheart.

1006
01:11:18,208 --> 01:11:19,458
Wish me luck.

1007
01:11:19,541 --> 01:11:20,916
- Best of luck.
- Thanks.

1008
01:11:25,791 --> 01:11:26,791
I, uh...

1009
01:11:28,958 --> 01:11:31,458
- Thanks for wearing that watch, son.
- Oh.

1010
01:11:31,541 --> 01:11:33,666
I can't tell you
how much that means to me.

1011
01:11:37,208 --> 01:11:39,708
Yeah, come on. Come on.

1012
01:11:45,125 --> 01:11:46,583
You grew up good.

1013
01:11:47,375 --> 01:11:48,375
Real good.

1014
01:11:51,541 --> 01:11:53,250
Well, um, stay in touch.

1015
01:11:53,916 --> 01:11:55,375
- A hundred percent.
- Okay.

1016
01:12:26,833 --> 01:12:28,125
You okay?

1017
01:12:31,125 --> 01:12:34,291
Yeah. Yeah, I'm okay. Thank you.

1018
01:12:37,458 --> 01:12:38,458
Yeah.

1019
01:12:47,166 --> 01:12:50,916
<i>Today, my sweet baby girl was born.</i>

1020
01:12:52,625 --> 01:12:56,375
<i>And I know I will never see her again.</i>

1021
01:12:57,833 --> 01:12:59,708
"So I'm gonna leave this diary behind."

1022
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:05,541
"Maybe someday she'll read it
and understand how much I love her."

1023
01:13:07,916 --> 01:13:09,666
<i>And always will.</i>

1024
01:13:11,708 --> 01:13:12,958
"And always will."

1025
01:13:19,833 --> 01:13:21,666
God, I hope that's true...

1026
01:13:24,875 --> 01:13:26,666
...what she said about loving me.

1027
01:13:40,916 --> 01:13:43,666
So I was thinking about Noel.

1028
01:13:44,333 --> 01:13:47,916
Should I call her first, or do you think
I should just show up tomorrow?

1029
01:13:48,000 --> 01:13:50,000
- What do you... what do you think?
- Hmm.

1030
01:13:50,083 --> 01:13:52,875
I think get some sleep
and decide in the morning.

1031
01:13:52,958 --> 01:13:53,958
Yeah.

1032
01:13:55,916 --> 01:13:57,875
Like I'm gonna sleep.

1033
01:13:59,708 --> 01:14:03,375
Um, let me just
triple check to make sure.

1034
01:14:07,208 --> 01:14:11,125
Oh, gosh, I'm sorry,
but we only have one room available.

1035
01:14:11,208 --> 01:14:14,000
- Oh, no, uh...
- We'll take it.

1036
01:14:16,208 --> 01:14:17,250
We'll take it?

1037
01:14:17,791 --> 01:14:19,208
Yeah, we'll...

1038
01:14:19,291 --> 01:14:21,916
- You know, we'll take it.
- Great.

1039
01:14:22,000 --> 01:14:23,000
Thank you.

1040
01:14:35,500 --> 01:14:37,208
So...

1041
01:14:38,208 --> 01:14:39,208
Um...

1042
01:14:39,750 --> 01:14:41,541
I have a confession to make.

1043
01:14:41,625 --> 01:14:42,708
- Confession?
- Yep.

1044
01:14:42,791 --> 01:14:43,916
Uh-oh! What'd she do?

1045
01:14:44,625 --> 01:14:46,375
Today is my birthday.

1046
01:14:48,166 --> 01:14:49,250
- No!
- Yeah.

1047
01:14:49,333 --> 01:14:51,208
- Today's your birthday?
- Yeah.

1048
01:14:52,708 --> 01:14:55,250
You're kidding.
You're just now telling me this? This is...

1049
01:14:56,083 --> 01:14:58,541
- What? You should have said something.
- Yeah.

1050
01:14:58,625 --> 01:15:01,041
This is a big deal.
You should've said something.

1051
01:15:01,125 --> 01:15:04,958
You know, you, uh, we can...
You know, it's a birthday. These are...

1052
01:15:05,041 --> 01:15:07,881
- What are you doing?
- We're gonna celebrate your birthday!

1053
01:15:07,916 --> 01:15:10,208
Hi! This is Jake Turner
from the Amber Suite.

1054
01:15:10,291 --> 01:15:11,375
I was wondering if...

1055
01:15:12,041 --> 01:15:15,458
Yeah, that Jake Turner. I...
Thank you. I appreciate it.

1056
01:15:15,541 --> 01:15:17,625
Listen, I was wondering
if you could do me a favor?

1057
01:15:17,708 --> 01:15:20,333
I've got a
birthday girl up here. I just found out.

1058
01:15:20,416 --> 01:15:23,416
I know it's late notice,
but do you have a birthday cake

1059
01:15:23,500 --> 01:15:26,708
or something,
a dessert you can put candles in?

1060
01:15:30,208 --> 01:15:32,000
You do? Terrific.

1061
01:15:32,083 --> 01:15:34,833
Uh, you know what? Yes, more red wine.

1062
01:15:34,916 --> 01:15:36,875
And you might as well send up
some champagne too

1063
01:15:36,958 --> 01:15:39,625
because it's a birthday,
champagne is for celebrating.

1064
01:15:39,708 --> 01:15:41,083
Wonderful. Thank you very much.

1065
01:15:48,250 --> 01:15:50,041
- You wanna dance?
- Really?

1066
01:15:50,125 --> 01:15:50,958
Yeah.

1067
01:15:51,041 --> 01:15:54,458
- Really?
- Yeah, come on. It's my birthday.

1068
01:15:54,541 --> 01:15:56,458

<i>First of all, I want you to know
that last night was beautiful.</i>

1094
01:18:10,833 --> 01:18:12,708
<i>And I'd be lying if I didn't admit</i>

1095
01:18:12,791 --> 01:18:15,708
<i>that I've been thinking about it
since the moment we met.</i>

1096
01:18:15,791 --> 01:18:19,208
<i>But I woke up in the middle of the night
feeling confused.</i>

1097
01:18:20,208 --> 01:18:21,666
<i>Really, really confused.</i>

1098
01:18:22,833 --> 01:18:25,000
<i>And the thing is Alan really loves me,</i>

1099
01:18:26,458 --> 01:18:27,916
<i>and that's not nothing.</i>

1100
01:18:29,958 --> 01:18:31,666
<i>And you have a very different life</i>

1101
01:18:31,750 --> 01:18:34,291
<i>with best-selling books,
and a million Instagram followers,</i>

1102
01:18:34,375 --> 01:18:35,375
<i>and I'm...</i>

1103
01:18:36,166 --> 01:18:37,416
<i>just getting launched,</i>

1104
01:18:37,500 --> 01:18:40,750
<i>which I totally understand,
at least to the extent that I can.</i>

1105
01:18:41,250 --> 01:18:45,125
<i>It's just that I'm a person who needs
a lot of certainty in their life.</i>

1106
01:18:45,208 --> 01:18:48,625
<i>And this time with you,
wonderful though it was,</i>

1107
01:18:49,791 --> 01:18:50,791
<i>it isn't that.</i>

1108
01:18:51,958 --> 01:18:55,708
<i>So I think it's better
that we part company now</i>

1109
01:18:56,583 --> 01:18:57,916
<i>before it's too late,</i>

1110
01:18:59,625 --> 01:19:00,708
<i>at least for me.</i>

1111
01:19:03,291 --> 01:19:05,458
<i>And I realized something else,</i>

1112
01:19:06,291 --> 01:19:07,291
<i>thanks to you.</i>

1113
01:19:08,541 --> 01:19:11,458
<i>My whole life,
I thought my mother didn't want me</i>

1114
01:19:11,958 --> 01:19:14,750
<i>and that I needed
to find her and ask her why.</i>

1115
01:19:14,833 --> 01:19:19,166
<i>But now that I've read her diary,
I know that she did truly love me,</i>

1116
01:19:19,250 --> 01:19:21,375
<i>and that's all that really matters.</i>

1117
01:19:22,875 --> 01:19:24,458
<i>Thank you for everything,</i>

1118
01:19:25,583 --> 01:19:29,208
<i>for going on this wild,
life-changing ride with me.</i>

1119
01:19:30,458 --> 01:19:32,166
<i>I'll never, ever forget it.</i>

1120
01:19:33,666 --> 01:19:34,666
<i>And, lastly,</i>

1121
01:19:36,291 --> 01:19:37,958
<i>I'll never, ever forget you.</i>

1122
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:51,583
- Pardon me, the, uh, nurses' station?
- Um, down the hall, to the right.

1123
01:19:51,666 --> 01:19:53,375
- To the right. Thank you.
- Welcome.

1124
01:20:02,666 --> 01:20:05,666
Excuse me. Hi, can you tell me
where to find Noel Hayden?

1125
01:20:07,875 --> 01:20:09,833
Hi, I'm Noel.

1126
01:20:11,875 --> 01:20:14,226
I called your house,
your husband told me where to find you.

1127
01:20:14,250 --> 01:20:16,375
I don't know if you remember me or not,
but, um...

1128
01:20:17,833 --> 01:20:19,041
I'm Jacob Turner.

1129
01:20:21,541 --> 01:20:22,708
Jacob?

1130
01:20:26,375 --> 01:20:27,375
Wow.

1131
01:20:30,416 --> 01:20:32,000
How are your folks?

1132
01:20:32,791 --> 01:20:34,750
Uh, my folks? My, um...

1133
01:20:36,458 --> 01:20:38,166
My mom just recently passed away.

1134
01:20:39,416 --> 01:20:40,416
Oh.

1135
01:20:41,166 --> 01:20:43,875
- I'm so sorry.
- Thank you. Yeah, it was very sudden.

1136
01:20:43,958 --> 01:20:46,041
- But your dad, he's...
- He's good.

1137
01:20:46,125 --> 01:20:47,166
He's, um...

1138
01:20:49,000 --> 01:20:51,958
Yeah, I just saw him for the first time
in a really long time, actually.

1139
01:20:52,041 --> 01:20:54,541
He's... He's good. He's hanging in.

1140
01:20:55,916 --> 01:20:57,250
Like the rest of us.

1141
01:20:57,333 --> 01:20:59,000
Like the rest of us, yeah.

1142
01:21:00,500 --> 01:21:01,500
Um...

1143
01:21:02,625 --> 01:21:05,000
You gotta be wondering
why I'm here after all these years.

1144
01:21:06,583 --> 01:21:10,083
It's a really long,
complicated story, but...

1145
01:21:11,041 --> 01:21:12,041
Noel,

1146
01:21:13,041 --> 01:21:15,416
when my brother died,

1147
01:21:16,875 --> 01:21:20,041
I didn't realize until just recently
how much you helped my family,

1148
01:21:20,125 --> 01:21:21,291
how much you helped me.

1149
01:21:22,541 --> 01:21:25,791
- You were just a little kid, Jake.
- But if you hadn't been there...

1150
01:21:25,875 --> 01:21:26,875
But I was.

1151
01:21:27,875 --> 01:21:29,291
And you got through it.

1152
01:21:34,458 --> 01:21:36,083
Now that I'm here, I can say thank you.

1153
01:21:37,250 --> 01:21:38,500
Now that you're here,

1154
01:21:39,500 --> 01:21:40,583
you're welcome.

1155
01:21:49,708 --> 01:21:53,333
There's one other thing I wanted
to talk to you about before I left, um...

1156
01:21:55,416 --> 01:21:58,458
The child that you had, your daughter.

1157
01:22:00,291 --> 01:22:01,291
Rachel.

1158
01:22:04,166 --> 01:22:05,166
She's...

1159
01:22:06,500 --> 01:22:09,541
wonderful, she's amazing.

1160
01:22:10,125 --> 01:22:11,458
I wanted you to know that.

1161
01:22:13,583 --> 01:22:14,958
You know her?

1162
01:22:16,208 --> 01:22:17,750
I do know her, um...

1163
01:22:19,666 --> 01:22:22,500
Yeah, she wanted to come here,
she wanted to meet you in person.

1164
01:22:22,583 --> 01:22:25,958
And I think, you know, after...
after reading this...

1165
01:22:31,041 --> 01:22:34,208
she felt a connection for sure, and, uh...

1166
01:22:36,291 --> 01:22:37,916
she understands everything.

1167
01:22:38,000 --> 01:22:39,000
Everything.

1168
01:22:43,208 --> 01:22:45,166
Thank you for telling me that.

1169
01:22:50,833 --> 01:22:51,958
Merry Christmas.

1170
01:22:53,208 --> 01:22:54,583
Merry Christmas, Jacob.

1171
01:22:57,291 --> 01:22:58,958
And thank you for this.

1172
01:22:59,958 --> 01:23:01,333
It's a precious gift.

1173
01:23:03,416 --> 01:23:04,458
And, Jake...

1174
01:23:06,208 --> 01:23:07,583
if you see my daughter,

1175
01:23:07,666 --> 01:23:10,750
would you tell her that
if she ever wants to get in touch,

1176
01:23:12,041 --> 01:23:13,916
I would like that very much.

1177
01:23:29,041 --> 01:23:30,166
Rachel.

1178
01:23:51,083 --> 01:23:53,833
Your dad's been
working on this since Thanksgiving.

1179
01:23:54,500 --> 01:23:55,625
I can't wait to see it.

1180
01:23:55,708 --> 01:23:58,041
I think it's the most beautiful
he's ever done.

1181
01:23:58,125 --> 01:24:00,250
Yeah?

1182
01:24:05,541 --> 01:24:07,541
Uh, when will Alan be coming?

1183
01:24:08,208 --> 01:24:10,041
Uh, soon. Soon.

1184
01:24:10,583 --> 01:24:13,666
- You don't sound too excited, honey.
- Well, I am, I just...

1185
01:24:14,208 --> 01:24:17,208
I don't know, "excited" is a bit...
a strong word.

1186
01:24:19,625 --> 01:24:23,958
I couldn't get it right until
finally last night at, like, 2:00 a.m.

1187
01:24:33,750 --> 01:24:37,208
No, you got it right, Dad.
This is... It's perfect.

1188
01:24:41,000 --> 01:24:43,375
I love it. This is...
It's perfect. Thank you.

1189
01:24:50,500 --> 01:24:52,625
Honey, you don't want to talk to Alan?

1190
01:24:52,708 --> 01:24:55,291
No, no, it's not that.
It's just that I don't, um...

1191
01:24:55,375 --> 01:24:58,083
I don't know.
Things are... We'll talk later, and it's...

1192
01:24:58,166 --> 01:25:00,458
We're sorting things...
sorting some things out right now.

1193
01:25:00,541 --> 01:25:02,958
"Sorting some things out"?
I thought you guys made up.

1194
01:25:03,041 --> 01:25:04,791
No, we... We did, we just...

1195
01:25:04,875 --> 01:25:07,833
You know, things are a little
up in the air right now.

1196
01:25:07,916 --> 01:25:11,541
This is starting to sound
a little like that cigar engagement ring.

1197
01:25:12,125 --> 01:25:15,000
Dad, stop. Seriously.

1198
01:25:15,791 --> 01:25:18,166
Um, sorry, guys, one sec.
I'll be right back.

1199
01:25:29,833 --> 01:25:31,458
Jake, you've gotta stop calling.

1200
01:25:31,541 --> 01:25:33,750
<i>No, I'm not gonna
stop calling until we talk.</i>

1201
01:25:33,833 --> 01:25:35,250
I don't want to do this.

1202
01:25:36,208 --> 01:25:37,625
Okay? I...

1203
01:25:37,708 --> 01:25:39,875
So I'm gonna just hang up the phone now.

1204
01:25:39,958 --> 01:25:42,166
Please don't try to find me, okay?

1205
01:25:47,166 --> 01:25:48,250
Too late.

1206
01:25:50,416 --> 01:25:51,625
Why are you doing this?

1207
01:25:53,083 --> 01:25:54,458
Do you really have to ask?

1208
01:25:54,541 --> 01:25:55,958
I'm not coming out.

1209
01:25:57,583 --> 01:25:58,875
I'm not. I can't.

1210
01:25:59,666 --> 01:26:02,625
Why? Why not? What are you...
What are you afraid of?

1211
01:26:02,708 --> 01:26:03,708
What's gonna happen?

1212
01:26:03,791 --> 01:26:05,208
Jake, you don't understand.

1213
01:26:06,916 --> 01:26:09,583
You don't. I have finally found something...

1214
01:26:09,666 --> 01:26:10,958
that I can really...

1215
01:26:11,750 --> 01:26:14,375
I can really count on, and...

1216
01:26:16,166 --> 01:26:18,541
It may not be perfect,
but it's what I want.

1217
01:26:20,041 --> 01:26:21,416
It's what I need.

1218
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:23,041
Okay?

1219
01:26:23,125 --> 01:26:24,625
So I need you to understand that.

1220
01:26:24,708 --> 01:26:27,083
I do understand.
I understand the whole thing.

1221
01:26:27,166 --> 01:26:28,416
I understand that...

1222
01:26:29,958 --> 01:26:32,708
what you may have needed before,
you don't need anymore.

1223
01:26:34,833 --> 01:26:35,833
Look at me, I...

1224
01:26:36,458 --> 01:26:38,750
All I wanted my entire life
was to be alone.

1225
01:26:39,333 --> 01:26:42,833
And it's hard for people like us
to trust, right?

1226
01:26:42,916 --> 01:26:43,958
To let people in.

1227
01:26:44,041 --> 01:26:47,375
It's hard. I understand that.
But here I am, right here, right now.

1228
01:26:47,458 --> 01:26:50,958
And I am standing here with the
only friend I have in the entire world.

1229
01:26:51,041 --> 01:26:53,000
I'm staring at the woman that I love,

1230
01:26:53,625 --> 01:26:56,625
and I'm begging you to trust me.

1231
01:26:56,708 --> 01:26:58,458
I'm telling you, you can trust me.

1232
01:27:00,000 --> 01:27:01,583
Just let me in, please.

1233
01:27:06,250 --> 01:27:07,250
Let me in.

1234
01:27:11,708 --> 01:27:12,833
Tell me

1235
01:27:13,708 --> 01:27:14,791
you don't love me.

1236
01:27:20,833 --> 01:27:22,500
Jake, that's Alan. You gotta go.

1237
01:27:22,583 --> 01:27:26,416
You tell me that you don't love me
and I'll go.

1238
01:27:37,666 --> 01:27:38,666
I don't love you.

01:29:54,041 --> 01:29:55,500
Oh, thank you.

1249
01:29:55,583 --> 01:29:57,458
Yes, I was packing up a few things,

1250
01:29:57,541 --> 01:29:59,916
then I need to lock up,
and then take off, so...

1251
01:30:00,583 --> 01:30:03,041
Would you care to join us for dinner?
We'd love to have you.

1252
01:30:03,125 --> 01:30:05,583
We really would.
We're having a few people over.

1253
01:30:05,666 --> 01:30:07,750
It's Christmas dinner, all the trimmings.

1254
01:30:07,833 --> 01:30:09,833
I would, I would love to, and thank you,

1255
01:30:09,916 --> 01:30:12,333
but I should take off
before the roads get too slick.

1256
01:30:12,416 --> 01:30:14,208
How did things go with your father?

1257
01:30:14,791 --> 01:30:16,458
Um, you know, they...

1258
01:30:16,541 --> 01:30:19,250
Better than expected.
Much better, actually.

1259
01:30:19,333 --> 01:30:20,708
- I told you.
- You did.

1260
01:30:20,791 --> 01:30:22,333
And Rachel and her mom?

1261
01:30:22,416 --> 01:30:24,458
I think that's gonna work itself out.

1262
01:30:24,541 --> 01:30:26,791
That's very good news. Excellent.

1263
01:30:27,291 --> 01:30:29,583
Oh, bloody hell,
I've gotta go baste the ham.

1264
01:30:29,666 --> 01:30:30,916
You sure you can't stay?

1265
01:30:31,708 --> 01:30:33,541
Well, Happy Christmas, old boy.

1266
01:30:33,625 --> 01:30:36,125
- Happy basting.
- I'll be right there.

1267
01:30:36,208 --> 01:30:37,291
Come on in.

1268
01:30:41,458 --> 01:30:42,916
And you and Rachel?

1269
01:30:43,000 --> 01:30:44,583
Oh, um...

1270
01:30:46,083 --> 01:30:49,000
No? Really? I was so sure.

1271
01:30:50,666 --> 01:30:52,083
Well, Kerouac said it.

1272
01:30:53,083 --> 01:30:54,750
"It all ends in tears, anyway."

1273
01:30:56,541 --> 01:30:59,083
But I'll be okay,
and Rachel will be okay too.

1274
01:30:59,166 --> 01:31:00,208
Of course.

1275
01:31:01,166 --> 01:31:02,166
Merry Christmas.

1276
01:31:02,875 --> 01:31:04,000
For me?

1277
01:31:04,083 --> 01:31:05,375
What did you do here?

1278
01:31:12,916 --> 01:31:14,250
Oh, Ellie...

1279
01:31:16,500 --> 01:31:17,500
You put the...

1280
01:31:18,791 --> 01:31:19,875
tree back in.

1281
01:31:19,958 --> 01:31:21,000
Yes.

1282
01:31:23,416 --> 01:31:25,625
I have wonderful memories of this house.

1283
01:31:25,708 --> 01:31:28,041
You and Benji playing in the yard.

1284
01:31:29,291 --> 01:31:30,291
Your folks.

1285
01:31:33,291 --> 01:31:34,458
Merry Christmas.

1286
01:31:35,833 --> 01:31:38,458
- Take care.
- Oh, you too. Take care of yourself too.

1287
01:31:38,541 --> 01:31:41,208
And thank you. This is just...
You're special.
