00:00:16,717 --> 00:00:24,251
I N T E R T E L L R

3
00:00:26,157 --> 00:00:28,203
My father was a farmer.

4
00:00:29,098 --> 00:00:32,000
Like all that time.

5
00:00:33,926 --> 00:00:36,125
Of course not started in this business.

6
00:00:41,853 --> 00:00:43,607
The computer says it's too tight.

7
00:00:43,916 --> 00:00:46,898
- I'm almost there.
- A cross the Strait.

8
00:00:49,345 --> 00:00:51,226
- Try to get off, Cooper.
- All right!

9
00:00:52,543 --> 00:00:55,279
- The proceed to foreclosure.
- No, do not do it!

10
00:00:59,279 --> 00:01:00,339
Father?

11
00:01:06,771 --> 00:01:09,747
Sorry, Murph. Come back to bed.

12
00:01:09,900 --> 00:01:11,458
I thought you were the ghost.

13
00:01:14,017 --> 00:01:18,382
- The ghosts do not exist, love.
- The grandfather says can you catch them.

14
00:01:19,649 --> 00:01:22,954
No, this is because the grandfather is
close to becoming one.

15
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,530
Come back to bed.

16
00:01:24,716 --> 00:01:26,577
I was dreaming about the accident?

17
00:01:27,875 --> 00:01:30,465
Go back to bed, Murph.

18
00:01:57,390 --> 00:01:59,168
We ran out of wheat.

19
00:01:59,379 --> 00:02:03,899
We came the plague and had to burn.
But still remained in the corn.

20
00:02:03,900 --> 00:02:08,141
We hectares of corn.
But what there was more dust.

21
00:02:10,680 --> 00:02:13,499
I can not describe -la,
It was simply continued.

22
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:17,401
Was just that,
a constant dust.

23
00:02:19,279 --> 00:02:22,245
We used sheet pieces

24
00:02:22,362 --> 00:02:27,612
to cover the nose and mouth.
So as not to inhale too -la.

25
00:02:29,290 --> 00:02:33,216
When we put the table,
the dishes were turned upside down.

26
00:02:33,367 --> 00:02:36,138
Glasses, cups,
everything was upside down.

27
00:02:41,882 --> 00:02:45,999
- Dispatch -t. Murph, touches the floor!
- Today at 13h, meet me at the barn.

28
00:02:46,000 --> 00:02:49,146
- Herbicide Resistance 101, understand?
- Yes, sir.

29
00:02:50,841 --> 00:02:52,259
At the table no, Murph.

30
00:02:53,081 --> 00:02:54,761
Father, you can arrange -la?

31
00:02:56,564 --> 00:02:59,189
- What the hell did you do to my rig?
- It was not me.

32
00:02:59,268 --> 00:03:03,199
- Let Me guess. Was your ghost?
- He dropped -a of my shelf.

33
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,453
- Just like the books.
- The ghosts do not exist, idiot!

34
00:03:05,466 --> 00:03:08,030
- Watch your language!
- Have I researched and calls If poltergeist.

35
00:03:08,109 --> 00:03:11,740
- Tell HIM, Dad.
- That's not very scientific, Murph.

36
00:03:11,853 --> 00:03:14,237
Said that science was admitted
our ignorance.

37
00:03:14,300 --> 00:03:15,549
Now shut -t.

38
00:03:15,600 --> 00:03:18,141
Anyway, try to have more
esteem for our stuff.

39
00:03:19,500 --> 00:03:20,580
Coop.

40
00:03:22,852 --> 00:03:25,373
All right.
Murph, if you want to talk about science,

41
00:03:26,800 --> 00:03:30,099
do not just say you're afraid of a
ghost. You have to go further.

42
00:03:30,100 --> 00:03:31,979
One must acknowledge the facts, analyze them,

43
00:03:32,018 --> 00:03:36,391
get to the how, why and after
present your findings. Okay?

44
00:03:36,904 --> 00:03:38,765
- Okay.
- Very well.

45
00:03:41,306 --> 00:03:43,292
- Have a good day of school.
- Wait.

46
00:03:43,664 --> 00:03:47,636
Parents meeting
It is with his father, not his grandfather.

47
00:03:50,510 --> 00:03:52,125
Calm, Turbo!

48
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:54,999
It is a dust storm.

49
00:03:55,000 --> 00:03:57,999
- The Nelson is burning the crops.
- Because of the plague?

50
00:03:58,000 --> 00:04:00,400
They say there will never be
Another okra harvest.

51
00:04:01,400 --> 00:04:02,564
Never again.

52
00:04:04,449 --> 00:04:09,140
- I should have planted corn as all of us.
- Be nice to the Hanley Professor.

53
00:04:09,142 --> 00:04:11,603
- It is single.
- And that means what?

54
00:04:11,713 --> 00:04:14,977
Repopulate the Earth.
Start doing your part, young.

55
00:04:15,053 --> 00:04:19,399
And if not metesses nose
which are not called? Old man.

56
00:04:26,284 --> 00:04:27,767
All right, Murph,
gets the second.

57
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,071
Third!

58
00:04:34,601 --> 00:04:37,707
- Looking for change, idiot.
- Cala -t, Tom!

59
00:04:38,611 --> 00:04:41,504
- What did you do, Murph?
- Not done anything more.

60
00:04:41,587 --> 00:04:44,000
- He blew a tire, that's all.
- Murphy's Law.

61
00:04:44,540 --> 00:04:45,572
Cala -t!

62
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:48,076
- Go get the spare, Tom.
- Already we are using.

63
00:04:50,350 --> 00:04:51,678
Brings kit for holes.

64
00:04:52,865 --> 00:04:54,895
How do fix it out here?

65
00:04:54,968 --> 00:04:58,372
You'll have to find out. I will not go
always be here to help you.

66
00:05:07,174 --> 00:05:08,741
What's wrong, Murph?

67
00:05:09,002 --> 00:05:12,000
Why did you and Mom
They gave me the name of something bad?

68
00:05:12,140 --> 00:05:13,567
I did not give anything.

69
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,473
Murphy's Law?

70
00:05:16,847 --> 00:05:19,721
Murphy's Law does not want to
say something bad...

71
00:05:20,031 --> 00:05:23,037
.. .irá Happen. Says -In only
that what has to happen,

72
00:05:23,638 --> 00:05:26,546
It happens.
And it seemed correct -In.

73
00:05:33,400 --> 00:05:34,431
Enter.

74
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:37,338
Come in, come on!

75
00:05:38,616 --> 00:05:40,701
What about the flat tire?

76
00:05:58,937 --> 00:06:00,599
It is a drone of the Indian Air Force.

77
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:02,900
The solar batteries could
feed a whole farm.

78
00:06:02,901 --> 00:06:04,221
Takes the wheel, Tom.

79
00:06:09,982 --> 00:06:11,500
Come on, accelerates!

80
00:06:13,055 --> 00:06:14,575
He points to it.

81
00:06:22,973 --> 00:06:25,007
- Faster, Tom, we are losing it.
- Right.

82
00:06:25,785 --> 00:06:27,250
Points out well for him.

83
00:06:28,719 --> 00:06:30,021
Wait...

84
00:06:30,932 --> 00:06:32,361
Here we go...

85
00:06:41,333 --> 00:06:42,855
Good driving, Tom.

86
00:06:49,380 --> 00:06:50,630
Father?

87
00:06:51,188 --> 00:06:53,388
I am about to catch it.
Do not stop now!

88
00:06:54,100 --> 00:06:56,332
- Father!
- Tom!

89
00:07:01,399 --> 00:07:03,392
What? Said to
continue driving.

90
00:07:04,533 --> 00:07:08,866
I think this answers the old question:
"If I throw a well, would you go back?"

91
00:07:12,344 --> 00:07:14,762
- I lost it.
- No, we have not lost!

92
00:07:27,774 --> 00:07:29,410
Would you like a ride?

93
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:36,391
Repairs.

94
00:07:42,005 --> 00:07:43,471
Come here.

95
00:07:44,071 --> 00:07:47,400
We will land it does there,
the dam margins.

96
00:07:51,465 --> 00:07:52,962
Very well.

97
00:07:56,200 --> 00:07:57,975
How long do you think
have you been up there?

98
00:07:58,053 --> 00:08:01,925
The Mission Control in Delhi
closed 10 years ago, such as ours.

99
00:08:03,299 --> 00:08:04,701
10 years ago?

100
00:08:07,995 --> 00:08:10,354
- Why was flying so low?
- I do not know.

101
00:08:10,666 --> 00:08:13,900
Perhaps the sun has fried the processor
or walked looking for something.

102
00:08:13,901 --> 00:08:14,700
What?

103
00:08:14,717 --> 00:08:18,150
Pass Me the screwdriver.
Perhaps some kind of sign.

104
00:08:18,659 --> 00:08:19,641
I do not know.

105
00:08:24,532 --> 00:08:26,073
What will you do with it?

106
00:08:26,770 --> 00:08:30,009
I will give HIM something socially
responsible for making...

107
00:08:31,044 --> 00:08:34,574
- How to drive a combine -debulhadora.
- We can not let it does go?

108
00:08:36,551 --> 00:08:38,227
It does not hurt anyone.

109
00:08:39,879 --> 00:08:44,172
Listen, Murph, this thing has to learn
adapting If, like us all.

110
00:08:48,851 --> 00:08:51,989
- So how do we do? Come with me?
- I have classes.

111
00:08:52,067 --> 00:08:54,554
But this girl,
You will have to wait.

112
00:08:56,227 --> 00:08:58,982
- What have you done?
- They say when you come after -t.

113
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,000
- I'll have to annoy me?
- Not with me.

114
00:09:01,001 --> 00:09:02,756
But please, controls -t.

115
00:09:03,072 --> 00:09:04,472
Do not worry.

116
00:09:05,850 --> 00:09:07,066
I got this!

117
00:09:11,653 --> 00:09:14,447
- You're late, Coop.
- Yes, I had a puncture.

118
00:09:14,717 --> 00:09:18,499
And I assume that you have stopped at a store
Chinese fighter jets.

119
00:09:18,500 --> 00:09:22,034
In fact, it -If
a surveillance drone.

120
00:09:22,144 --> 00:09:24,666
With a solar batteries
exceptional. It is Indian.

121
00:09:25,400 --> 00:09:26,547
Sits -t.

122
00:09:27,935 --> 00:09:32,241
Well, we already have the results of Tom.

123
00:09:33,382 --> 00:09:37,074
- It'll be a great farmer.
- Yes, you are falling for it.

124
00:09:37,283 --> 00:09:38,748
What about college?

125
00:09:39,006 --> 00:09:42,808
Well, just enter the university.
There are not enough resources.

126
00:09:42,880 --> 00:09:47,800
I continue to pay taxes. Where
the money goes? There are no more armies.

127
00:09:47,911 --> 00:09:49,802
For universities
will certainly not.

128
00:09:50,924 --> 00:09:52,499
Look, Coop, you have to be realistic.

129
00:09:52,500 --> 00:09:57,133
Now you close the doors of
University to my child? He is 15 years old.

130
00:09:57,140 --> 00:09:59,840
The result of Tom is not
loud enough.

131
00:10:00,400 --> 00:10:01,759
As medes waist?

132
00:10:01,760 --> 00:10:06,450
- About 80, 84 of crotch?
- I do not see where you want to reach.

133
00:10:06,460 --> 00:10:08,896
Are you telling me that are accurate
2 numbers to measure your ass,

134
00:10:08,897 --> 00:10:11,598
but only one for
measure the future of my child?

135
00:10:12,220 --> 00:10:15,058
Come on, you are a learned man, Coop...

136
00:10:15,170 --> 00:10:17,407
and a trained pilot.
- And an engineer.

137
00:10:17,542 --> 00:10:22,264
Okay, but now we do not need
more engineers.

138
00:10:22,808 --> 00:10:27,341
We were not without television or
aircraft; we ran out of food.

139
00:10:27,453 --> 00:10:31,813
The world needs farmers.
Good farmers like you and Tom.

140
00:10:31,834 --> 00:10:36,652
- Uneducated farmers.
- We are a provisional generation, Coop.

141
00:10:36,771 --> 00:10:40,173
And things are improving.
Perhaps your grandchildren will eventually be...

142
00:10:40,174 --> 00:10:41,396
Already we finished, sir?

143
00:10:42,765 --> 00:10:46,678
No. Ms. Hanley is
here to talk about Murph.

144
00:10:47,189 --> 00:10:49,999
The Murph is a flawless girl,
very clever.

145
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:51,899
But it has had some
problems lately.

146
00:10:51,900 --> 00:10:55,900
I brought it to an oral presentation.
The chapter on lunar landings.

147
00:10:56,006 --> 00:11:00,899
Yes, it's one of my old books.
Always liked the pictures.

148
00:11:01,100 --> 00:11:04,633
It is an old federal book.
Substituímo it does the corrected versions.

149
00:11:05,210 --> 00:11:08,027
- Fixed?
- Explain that the Apollo missions

150
00:11:08,050 --> 00:11:10,669
They were simulated to take
the Soviet Union into bankruptcy.

151
00:11:17,300 --> 00:11:19,387
We do not believe that we went to the moon?

152
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:24,299
I believe it was an advertisement
bright it took the Soviets

153
00:11:24,300 --> 00:11:27,600
the esturrarem resources
rockets and other useless machines.

154
00:11:27,640 --> 00:11:29,076
Useless machines?

155
00:11:29,100 --> 00:11:32,664
And if you do not want to repeat the excesses
and waste of the 20th century,

156
00:11:32,699 --> 00:11:35,199
then we have to elucidate the
our children on this planet.

157
00:11:35,200 --> 00:11:37,100
No stories of how abandon it.

158
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:41,621
I know one of these machines
useless they used. If called MRI.

159
00:11:42,231 --> 00:11:45,433
And if we still had any,
doctors could have detected

160
00:11:45,434 --> 00:11:49,399
cyst in the brain of my
woman before she died not after.

161
00:11:49,500 --> 00:11:52,837
In that case, she would be sitting here
to hear it instead of me,

162
00:11:52,917 --> 00:11:57,804
which would be great, for it
always had more patience.

163
00:11:58,508 --> 00:12:00,851
I'm sorry for his wife, Mr. Cooper.

164
00:12:02,039 --> 00:12:05,404
But Murph became aggressive
with some of his colleagues

165
00:12:05,405 --> 00:12:07,809
because of this nonsense
Mission Apollo.

166
00:12:07,844 --> 00:12:10,955
As such we thought fit to call it does
to discuss how best

167
00:12:10,990 --> 00:12:13,265
to deal with this behavior
hereinafter.

168
00:12:14,172 --> 00:12:17,536
Because, it turns out tomorrow
at night there game.

169
00:12:17,691 --> 00:12:21,419
She is now a baseball,
and will play her favorite team.

170
00:12:21,432 --> 00:12:23,489
There will be candy, soft drinks...

171
00:12:27,020 --> 00:12:28,976
I think I'll take her.

172
00:12:34,182 --> 00:12:38,080
- How did it go?
- I got -te a suspension.

173
00:12:38,490 --> 00:12:40,247
- What?!
- Cooper.

174
00:12:41,623 --> 00:12:42,925
Speaks Cooper says.

175
00:12:43,030 --> 00:12:46,003
Coop, the harvesters that -debulhadoras
If reconstruíste passed through.

176
00:12:46,004 --> 00:12:50,891
- Reset the controls.
- I've done it, but you should come take a look.

177
00:13:10,878 --> 00:13:13,999
Abandoned fields
and returned here one after another.

178
00:13:14,070 --> 00:13:16,373
Something is interfering with the compass.

179
00:13:17,287 --> 00:13:20,134
Magnetism.
Or something.

180
00:14:02,789 --> 00:14:07,003
There is nothing special about the books. I have
been working on it, like you said.

181
00:14:08,073 --> 00:14:10,344
- I counted the spaces.
- What for?

182
00:14:12,397 --> 00:14:16,834
For the Ghost case try
communicate. I'm trying to Morse.

183
00:14:17,411 --> 00:14:21,624
- Morse?
- Yes, dots and dashes...

184
00:14:21,696 --> 00:14:23,499
I know what it is Morse code, Murph.

185
00:14:23,500 --> 00:14:26,222
But I do not think your bookshelf
is trying to talk to you.

186
00:14:37,978 --> 00:14:42,104
I had to reset every clock
compass and GPS to correct the anomaly.

187
00:14:42,587 --> 00:14:45,015
- What was?
- I do not know.

188
00:14:46,832 --> 00:14:49,199
If the house had been built
on magnetic ore,

189
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,030
we would have repaired the
first time we called the tractor.

190
00:14:54,999 --> 00:14:57,994
I heard that the meeting at school
I did not go too well.

191
00:14:59,511 --> 00:15:04,182
Oh yes? It is as if we had
forgotten who we are, Donald.

192
00:15:05,900 --> 00:15:09,345
Explorers, pioneers,
not only caregivers.

193
00:15:11,545 --> 00:15:15,882
When I was young, I felt as if Me
invent something new every day.

194
00:15:15,994 --> 00:15:19,221
Whether it was a device or idea.

195
00:15:19,231 --> 00:15:24,000
As if it were Christmas every day,
but in a world of 6 billion people.

196
00:15:24,400 --> 00:15:26,000
Tries to imagine.

197
00:15:27,232 --> 00:15:30,219
And each of them trying to
monopolize everything.

198
00:15:33,510 --> 00:15:35,498
This world is not so bad.

199
00:15:38,000 --> 00:15:41,548
And Tom will adapt up well.
I do not encaixas you.

200
00:15:41,623 --> 00:15:44,918
Born 40 years more
late or 40 years earlier.

201
00:15:45,554 --> 00:15:47,979
My daughter well knew.
God bless her.

202
00:15:48,800 --> 00:15:51,664
And your children will know,
especially Murph.

203
00:15:52,973 --> 00:15:55,986
Before we looked at
the sky and wondered

204
00:15:56,300 --> 00:15:58,483
which was our place in the stars.

205
00:16:01,131 --> 00:16:02,774
Now look down

206
00:16:03,183 --> 00:16:05,847
and -In are concerned with
our place in the dust.

207
00:16:05,955 --> 00:16:08,597
Cooper, thou good eras
in something,

208
00:16:08,995 --> 00:16:12,071
but never had the
exploring opportunity.

209
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,906
Sorry.

210
00:16:15,551 --> 00:16:19,620
Nobody expected the
land that gave us food,

211
00:16:19,872 --> 00:16:23,222
turned against
us and destroy them.

212
00:16:23,302 --> 00:16:27,700
April, if I remember correctly.
I believe it was April 15.

213
00:16:28,000 --> 00:16:32,671
It was around 13: 30h than that
thing collapsed Gorge top.

214
00:16:34,446 --> 00:16:38,025
In my time it is that there was real
players. Who are these stray?

215
00:16:39,035 --> 00:16:40,835
Yes, but in my time, people
they were too busy

216
00:16:40,921 --> 00:16:43,247
to fight for food,
instead of playing baseball.

217
00:16:43,682 --> 00:16:48,399
Popcorn in a baseball game even looks
evil. I want a hot dog.

218
00:16:48,400 --> 00:16:50,567
They say you're going to school
follow my footsteps.

219
00:16:51,615 --> 00:16:54,679
- It seems Me quite well.
- It seems -t well?

220
00:16:54,792 --> 00:16:58,570
I hate the fifth, Dad.
Words grandfather.

221
00:16:58,678 --> 00:17:03,320
That's what grandfather said? Listen, what matters
It is how you feel about it.

222
00:17:03,865 --> 00:17:07,573
I like what I do.
And taste of our farm.

223
00:17:08,223 --> 00:17:09,966
And it'll be very good at it.

224
00:17:22,985 --> 00:17:24,434
Let pisgar -In here.

225
00:17:31,601 --> 00:17:36,138
Okay, this is the brave.
Malta, plays to put the masks.

226
00:17:39,489 --> 00:17:41,255
- Tom, Murph ready?
- Yes.

227
00:18:34,986 --> 00:18:37,198
Murph, Tom, closed the windows?

228
00:18:41,748 --> 00:18:42,743
Murph.

229
00:19:04,469 --> 00:19:05,700
The ghost.

230
00:19:06,650 --> 00:19:08,117
Grab your pad.

231
00:19:09,000 --> 00:19:10,770
You're gonna sleep with Tom.

232
00:20:05,818 --> 00:20:07,636
Not a ghost.

233
00:20:12,856 --> 00:20:14,290
It gravity.

234
00:20:16,207 --> 00:20:18,483
I take the tone, then follow the city.

235
00:20:18,796 --> 00:20:22,917
You're gonna clean the room?
When they are done for the honor.

236
00:20:48,327 --> 00:20:51,100
Not Morse, Murph, is binary.

237
00:20:51,101 --> 00:20:53,741
The thick lines
equals 1, the fine 0.

238
00:20:57,685 --> 00:20:58,934
They are coordinated.

239
00:21:12,428 --> 00:21:13,900
That's right.

240
00:21:14,900 --> 00:21:16,600
I can not lose pinch.

241
00:21:16,900 --> 00:21:19,572
The grandfather returns here
a few hours, Murph.

242
00:21:20,664 --> 00:21:23,127
But you not know what you will find.

243
00:21:24,642 --> 00:21:28,542
It is therefore,
that I can not take you.

244
00:21:35,000 --> 00:21:35,971
Murph.

245
00:21:37,999 --> 00:21:41,481
Grandfather comes soon,
HIM says that after I turn on the radio.

246
00:21:48,436 --> 00:21:49,386
Jesus!

247
00:21:50,140 --> 00:21:51,500
What are you doing here?

248
00:21:52,135 --> 00:21:54,500
You think that's funny?

249
00:21:54,751 --> 00:21:56,914
I would not be here if it was not me.

250
00:21:58,894 --> 00:22:01,231
Do something useful.

251
00:23:04,403 --> 00:23:05,383
Murph.

252
00:23:07,200 --> 00:23:08,152
Murph.

253
00:23:11,628 --> 00:23:13,857
I think the road stops here.

254
00:23:16,864 --> 00:23:19,057
Brought a cutting pliers?

255
00:23:20,234 --> 00:23:21,604
Beautiful girl!

256
00:23:49,000 --> 00:23:52,617
- Move If the fence.
- Do not shoot, I'm unarmed.

257
00:23:52,724 --> 00:23:53,981
My daughter is in the car.

258
00:23:59,700 --> 00:24:01,023
Do not be afraid.

259
00:24:13,938 --> 00:24:18,450
- How did you find this place?
- Where is my daughter?

260
00:24:18,564 --> 00:24:21,329
I had the coordinates of these
facilities marked on the map.

261
00:24:21,330 --> 00:24:23,900
- How is that achieved?
- Where is my daughter?

262
00:24:23,901 --> 00:24:26,678
Do not make me knock it does
Again, feel -If!

263
00:24:27,386 --> 00:24:29,734
You think yet
you are a Marine, comrade?

264
00:24:29,745 --> 00:24:32,148
The Marines do not exist.
And you know what?

265
00:24:32,700 --> 00:24:35,962
I have soldiers like you
Me cut the grass.

266
00:24:36,000 --> 00:24:37,600
Where did you find these coordinates?

267
00:24:37,697 --> 00:24:39,848
Unless you wanna end
as a cut -relvas...

268
00:24:40,498 --> 00:24:44,721
- I think I'd give a fabulous cleaner.
- Do not think so.

269
00:24:46,201 --> 00:24:48,686
TARS, retreats, please.

270
00:24:49,947 --> 00:24:53,299
It is to take risks to
use security ex-military.

271
00:24:53,300 --> 00:24:57,202
They are antiquated and units
control are unpredictable.

272
00:24:57,315 --> 00:24:59,219
That's what the government could arrange.

273
00:25:00,976 --> 00:25:03,815
- Who are you?
- I'm Dr. Brand.

274
00:25:03,926 --> 00:25:06,900
I met once a Dr. Brand,
but was a teacher.

275
00:25:07,120 --> 00:25:08,893
What makes you think I'm not?

276
00:25:08,894 --> 00:25:10,994
It was not so handy.

277
00:25:11,539 --> 00:25:14,600
Please Dra. Brand,
I have no idea where I'm stuck.

278
00:25:14,801 --> 00:25:17,500
But I am worried about
my daughter, and I want -a beside me.

279
00:25:17,505 --> 00:25:20,228
Bring -a and tell HIM -ei
everything you want to know.

280
00:25:23,470 --> 00:25:26,097
Takes the director and the girl
to the meeting room.

281
00:25:27,500 --> 00:25:30,849
Your daughter's fine.
It is quite insightful.

282
00:25:31,227 --> 00:25:35,599
- You must have a very intelligent mother.
- Made it clear they do not want visits.

283
00:25:35,600 --> 00:25:39,878
Why not let us go back for
where we came from and follow path?

284
00:25:40,021 --> 00:25:42,801
- It's not that simple.
- Of course it is.

285
00:25:42,913 --> 00:25:45,899
I know nothing about you,
nor about this place.

286
00:25:47,208 --> 00:25:48,539
You know yes.

287
00:25:54,297 --> 00:25:55,203
Father!

288
00:25:58,034 --> 00:25:59,430
Hello, Cooper.

289
00:26:00,492 --> 00:26:01,718
Professor Brand.

290
00:26:03,056 --> 00:26:05,684
Explain how you found Me
these facilities.

291
00:26:05,762 --> 00:26:09,349
It was as if tropessássemos them.
We were on a rescue mission...

292
00:26:09,350 --> 00:26:11,751
He is sitting in secret
best kept in the world.

293
00:26:11,800 --> 00:26:15,399
Nobody stumbles in
entry or exit.

294
00:26:15,999 --> 00:26:19,898
Cooper, please
cooperates with these people.

295
00:26:20,100 --> 00:26:24,213
Well, it's hard to explain.

296
00:26:24,500 --> 00:26:28,122
We found these coordinates

297
00:26:28,123 --> 00:26:30,663
- Through an anomaly.
- What kind of anomaly?

298
00:26:30,704 --> 00:26:34,199
Hesitate to qualify her from
supernatural, but it is not scientific...

299
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:38,199
You will have to start being more
Specifically, Mr. Cooper, and quickly.

300
00:26:38,300 --> 00:26:39,850
It gravity.

301
00:26:44,605 --> 00:26:47,412
What kind of anomaly
gravitational and where?

302
00:26:47,492 --> 00:26:50,908
I really like your
enthusiasm for gravity, but...

303
00:26:51,309 --> 00:26:54,000
We will not say anything
until we have guarantees.

304
00:26:54,001 --> 00:26:55,629
- Guarantees?
- Exactly.

305
00:26:56,530 --> 00:27:00,510
As we leave here safely
and not in the boot of a car.

306
00:27:02,607 --> 00:27:06,349
- Do not you know who we are, Coop?
- No, Teacher, I do not know.

307
00:27:06,457 --> 00:27:10,359
You know my father, Professor Brand.
We NASA.

308
00:27:11,994 --> 00:27:14,079
- NASA?
- Exactly.

309
00:27:14,422 --> 00:27:16,744
The same NASA to whom pilotavas.

310
00:27:27,334 --> 00:27:30,550
I heard they were extinct by
refuse to drop bombs

311
00:27:30,551 --> 00:27:33,448
the stratosphere over
hungry people.

312
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:35,604
When they realized that killing people

313
00:27:35,605 --> 00:27:40,000
It was not a long term solution,
again they need us. Secret.

314
00:27:40,001 --> 00:27:41,300
Why keep it secret?

315
00:27:41,301 --> 00:27:45,199
Because public opinion would not
approve spending on space exploration.

316
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:47,765
Not when we fight for
put food on the table.

317
00:27:49,074 --> 00:27:50,400
Pests.

318
00:27:50,600 --> 00:27:53,271
They decimated the wheat,
seven years ago.

319
00:27:53,272 --> 00:27:56,899
Okra this year.
Only left the corn.

320
00:27:57,400 --> 00:27:59,299
But we have the production
highest ever.

321
00:27:59,300 --> 00:28:03,605
Yes, but like potatoes in Ireland
and wheat during the dust storm,

322
00:28:04,304 --> 00:28:06,797
corn will have its end.

323
00:28:07,474 --> 00:28:08,607
Soon.

324
00:28:13,775 --> 00:28:17,462
We'll find a way,
Teacher, always did.

325
00:28:18,070 --> 00:28:22,164
Guided by the firm belief
that the earth is ours.

326
00:28:22,579 --> 00:28:24,696
No, not just ours.

327
00:28:25,564 --> 00:28:27,084
But it is our home.

328
00:28:27,835 --> 00:28:31,475
The Earth's atmosphere
It is composed of 80% nitrogen.

329
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:33,515
But we do not even breathe the.

330
00:28:33,530 --> 00:28:38,341
Pests yes, and as they proliferate,
our air gets less and less oxygen.

331
00:28:38,800 --> 00:28:42,278
The last to starve
They are the first to suffocate.

332
00:28:42,600 --> 00:28:44,577
And the generation of thy daughter

333
00:28:46,176 --> 00:28:48,799
It will be the last on Earth.

334
00:28:48,800 --> 00:28:52,699
The Murph is getting tired. I let -la
get some rest in my office?

335
00:28:52,700 --> 00:28:54,192
Sure, thanks.

336
00:28:57,285 --> 00:28:58,303
Very well.

337
00:28:59,047 --> 00:29:02,311
Now tell Me what is the
his plan to save the world?

338
00:29:03,300 --> 00:29:07,169
The idea is not to save the world.
It leaves it.

339
00:29:12,813 --> 00:29:14,000
Rangers.

340
00:29:14,001 --> 00:29:17,999
The latest components
our versatile ship in orbit.

341
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:21,105
The Endurance. Our ultimate expedition.

342
00:29:21,614 --> 00:29:25,183
You sent people into space
looking for a new home?

343
00:29:25,291 --> 00:29:28,185
- The Lazarus missions.
- Sounds exciting.

344
00:29:28,292 --> 00:29:32,552
- Lazarus back from the dead.
- Sure, but first he had to die.

345
00:29:32,662 --> 00:29:35,799
There is no planet in our
solar system that can sustain life

346
00:29:35,800 --> 00:29:38,300
and the nearest star
It is a thousand years away.

347
00:29:38,301 --> 00:29:40,963
It is no attainable goal.

348
00:29:42,880 --> 00:29:44,135
Where you sent them?

349
00:29:44,206 --> 00:29:50,504
Cooper, I can not advance any more,
unless accepted steer this ship.

350
00:29:50,920 --> 00:29:54,514
- You are the best pilot we've ever had.
- I barely got out of the stratosphere.

351
00:29:54,622 --> 00:29:56,925
This team never left the simulator.

352
00:29:56,998 --> 00:30:00,799
We need a pilot, and this is the
mission to which they were trained.

353
00:30:01,100 --> 00:30:02,799
Even without knowledge?

354
00:30:03,390 --> 00:30:07,649
An hour ago, they did not even know I was
alive but would anyway.

355
00:30:07,831 --> 00:30:11,785
We had no choice.
But something brought you here.

356
00:30:11,930 --> 00:30:14,393
- They chose -t.
- They who?

357
00:30:22,542 --> 00:30:26,213
- How long I will be out?
- Hard to say.

358
00:30:26,725 --> 00:30:30,232
- Years?
- I have children, Professor.

359
00:30:30,843 --> 00:30:33,505
Go there and saves -the.

360
00:30:36,315 --> 00:30:37,700
Who are they?

361
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:42,044
We began to detect anomalies
gravitational, nearly 50 years ago.

362
00:30:42,079 --> 00:30:45,727
Basically, small distortions in
our equipment into the upper atmosphere.

363
00:30:45,730 --> 00:30:49,004
In fact, I believe that
Also you find one.

364
00:30:49,700 --> 00:30:51,411
Yes, in the Strait.

365
00:30:52,400 --> 00:30:55,610
During despenhamento, something
disabled the electronic controls.

366
00:30:55,620 --> 00:30:56,778
Exactly.

367
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:02,628
But of all the anomalies,
This is the most significant.

368
00:31:02,774 --> 00:31:06,692
Close to Saturn.
A change in the space -time.

369
00:31:09,052 --> 00:31:12,389
- It is a wormhole?
- She appeared 48 years ago.

370
00:31:12,539 --> 00:31:16,597
- And you will be where?
- The other galaxy.

371
00:31:18,400 --> 00:31:21,060
A wormhole is not a phenomenon
what happens naturally.

372
00:31:21,061 --> 00:31:23,702
- Somebody put him there.
- They?

373
00:31:24,962 --> 00:31:29,034
And whoever they are,
it seems they are in to help.

374
00:31:29,443 --> 00:31:32,599
Wormhole that allows -In
travel to other stars.

375
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,399
It appeared exactly
when needed.

376
00:31:34,400 --> 00:31:37,608
They put potentially worlds
habitable within reach.

377
00:31:37,632 --> 00:31:41,701
- Twelve, based on the first probes.
- Probes sent there?

378
00:31:42,247 --> 00:31:43,981
We sent people there,

379
00:31:44,393 --> 00:31:45,693
ten years ago.

380
00:31:46,494 --> 00:31:48,244
The Lazarus missions.

381
00:31:48,550 --> 00:31:51,784
Twelve possible worlds,
Rangers twelve launches.

382
00:31:51,785 --> 00:31:55,129
Transporting humans more
Bold history.

383
00:31:55,307 --> 00:31:58,084
Led by
Dr extraordinary. Mann.

384
00:31:58,360 --> 00:32:01,499
Each personal landing capsule
He secured survive two years.

385
00:32:01,500 --> 00:32:03,599
But it could resort to hibernation
to prolong this time,

386
00:32:03,600 --> 00:32:07,120
extending the analysis environments
Organic for decades.

387
00:32:07,270 --> 00:32:09,529
The mission consisted of
evaluate this new world

388
00:32:09,530 --> 00:32:14,200
and proved potential would send one
sign before entering a long sleep

389
00:32:14,201 --> 00:32:17,743
- Waiting to be rescued.
- And if the world did not show potential?

390
00:32:18,635 --> 00:32:20,009
Hence bravery.

391
00:32:20,698 --> 00:32:24,390
- Do not have the resources to visit the twelve.
- Certainly.

392
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:28,399
The data transmission through the
wormhole is rudimentary.

393
00:32:28,400 --> 00:32:30,600
Simple binary packages
received annually

394
00:32:30,601 --> 00:32:33,823
-In give clues
Worlds with potential.

395
00:32:33,894 --> 00:32:35,700
One of the systems
If shown promise.

396
00:32:35,701 --> 00:32:38,400
Just one. More like
a long shot, right?

397
00:32:38,981 --> 00:32:42,006
A system with
three potential planets.

398
00:32:42,308 --> 00:32:44,095
There's nothing remote.

399
00:32:46,209 --> 00:32:47,554
Wait there.

400
00:32:48,000 --> 00:32:49,924
So if we find a good place,

401
00:32:53,606 --> 00:32:57,089
what happens?
- This is the remote possibility.

402
00:32:57,400 --> 00:33:00,246
There is a plan A and a plan B.

403
00:33:01,300 --> 00:33:04,678
Did you notice anything strange
the launch camera?

404
00:33:15,990 --> 00:33:18,799
The whole installation is centrifugal.

405
00:33:19,012 --> 00:33:21,899
It's some kind of vehicle?
A space station?

406
00:33:21,930 --> 00:33:24,005
Both. That's the plan A.

407
00:33:24,006 --> 00:33:25,714
How to raise the ground?

408
00:33:26,100 --> 00:33:30,000
The first abnormalities
gravitational changed everything.

409
00:33:30,001 --> 00:33:34,399
Suddenly, we knew the
use of gravity was real.

410
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:38,196
As such, I started working
a theory and we started

411
00:33:38,267 --> 00:33:41,899
- The construction of this station.
- But still not resolved.

412
00:33:42,900 --> 00:33:44,650
That is why there is a backup plan.

413
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,840
The problem is gravity.

414
00:33:46,847 --> 00:33:49,989
Taking a quantity
viable of people on the planet?

415
00:33:50,250 --> 00:33:53,871
Here is a way, the B plan.
A demographic bomb.

416
00:33:54,182 --> 00:33:59,000
We'll get 5, 000 fertilized ova
weighing up to 900Kg.

417
00:34:00,101 --> 00:34:01,400
How do they would develop?

418
00:34:01,501 --> 00:34:04,299
With the equipment on board
We incubate the first ten.

419
00:34:04,300 --> 00:34:07,999
Thereafter, with surrogate mothers
If this growth is exponential.

420
00:34:08,600 --> 00:34:12,089
In thirty years, we
generate a colony of hundreds.

421
00:34:12,302 --> 00:34:15,983
The real difficulty of
Colonization is the genetic diversity.

422
00:34:16,050 --> 00:34:17,554
With this, the matter is resolved.

423
00:34:18,000 --> 00:34:22,397
What about the people of Earth?
Just drop them?

424
00:34:22,700 --> 00:34:23,865
What about my children?

425
00:34:24,290 --> 00:34:28,000
That's why Plan A
It is much more attractive.

426
00:34:30,001 --> 00:34:33,030
- What progress?
- I'm almost there.

427
00:34:33,040 --> 00:34:35,768
Asks Me to quit...

428
00:34:36,600 --> 00:34:40,799
- The name of a "quasi".
- I'm asking you to trust me -t.

429
00:34:43,978 --> 00:34:45,697
-In Find a new home.

430
00:34:46,200 --> 00:34:51,500
And when you return, I will have
solved the problem of gravity.

431
00:34:52,522 --> 00:34:54,150
-t Give you my word.

432
00:35:06,600 --> 00:35:07,921
Will -te though!

433
00:35:18,794 --> 00:35:23,097
- Murph.
- Go. If you must go, go!

434
00:35:25,988 --> 00:35:28,892
This world has always been small
for you, it was not, Cooper?

435
00:35:29,437 --> 00:35:33,292
Why? Because feel
I was born to travel through space?

436
00:35:34,180 --> 00:35:36,299
Because it makes me excited?

437
00:35:36,800 --> 00:35:40,699
- It does not make it wrong.
- Maybe do.

438
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
Do not trust the correct,
when the subject is wrong.

439
00:35:44,744 --> 00:35:49,324
- The "why" is the great foundation.
- And the foundation is solid.

440
00:35:52,659 --> 00:35:55,008
We farmers, we'd sit -In
here every year

441
00:35:55,043 --> 00:35:59,499
when the rains came and we said:
"for next year."

442
00:35:59,700 --> 00:36:03,380
Well, next year we do not
will save, nor to come.

443
00:36:03,790 --> 00:36:08,398
This world is a treasure, Donald, but there
some time telling us to leave.

444
00:36:13,091 --> 00:36:16,921
Humanity was born on Earth, but not
mean you have to die here.

445
00:36:20,266 --> 00:36:23,487
Tom is right, but you must
work things out with Murph.

446
00:36:23,551 --> 00:36:24,701
I will.

447
00:36:25,502 --> 00:36:28,442
Without making promises
you know you can not keep.

448
00:36:39,075 --> 00:36:41,189
You have to talk to me, Murph.

449
00:36:43,697 --> 00:36:46,079
We have to make peace
before you left.

450
00:36:46,100 --> 00:36:48,708
Then continue angry
just for you to stay.

451
00:36:50,641 --> 00:36:55,913
When you were born, your mother told Me
something that never got to understand.

452
00:36:55,914 --> 00:37:01,007
Me said: "Now we are here...

453
00:37:01,632 --> 00:37:04,172
to be the memories
of our children. "

454
00:37:09,014 --> 00:37:11,670
I think I now understand
what she meant.

455
00:37:15,180 --> 00:37:19,094
When are the Father, the -t recompensest
Future ghost of your children.

456
00:37:20,786 --> 00:37:22,840
Said that ghosts do not exist.

457
00:37:29,213 --> 00:37:30,669
True, Murph.

458
00:37:34,025 --> 00:37:35,469
Look at me.

459
00:37:38,347 --> 00:37:40,786
I can not be your ghost now.

460
00:37:42,663 --> 00:37:44,593
I need to exist.

461
00:37:46,295 --> 00:37:48,200
They chose Me.

462
00:37:48,840 --> 00:37:52,582
Murp, they chose Me. You saw.
You're the one you took me to them.

463
00:37:55,450 --> 00:37:57,779
That's why even if you can not go.

464
00:38:01,302 --> 00:38:03,219
I deciphered the message.

465
00:38:03,800 --> 00:38:06,288
It's a word. You know what?

466
00:38:06,429 --> 00:38:08,530
- Murph.
- FICA.

467
00:38:08,680 --> 00:38:11,754
- He says to become the father.
- Murph.

468
00:38:12,567 --> 00:38:16,868
Do not believe me!
Look for books. He said FICA.

469
00:38:16,926 --> 00:38:20,380
Why not give me ears?
He said IT IS!

470
00:38:20,600 --> 00:38:22,099
I'll return.

471
00:38:22,500 --> 00:38:23,890
When?

472
00:38:36,742 --> 00:38:39,480
One for you.
One for me.

473
00:38:39,586 --> 00:38:41,893
Once you're up there
in hyper -sono,

474
00:38:42,087 --> 00:38:45,700
or travel at the speed of light,

475
00:38:45,800 --> 00:38:48,600
or near a black hole,

476
00:38:49,000 --> 00:38:51,506
the time will be different for me.

477
00:38:51,851 --> 00:38:53,920
Will walk slower.

478
00:38:54,157 --> 00:38:57,002
Therefore, when
we meet again,

479
00:38:58,503 --> 00:39:01,575
- We will compare.
- Time will pass differently to us?

480
00:39:01,688 --> 00:39:02,518
Yes.

481
00:39:03,631 --> 00:39:07,120
Maybe when I get back,
we have the same age.

482
00:39:07,130 --> 00:39:09,899
You and me. It is absurd!

483
00:39:10,130 --> 00:39:11,524
Can you imagine?

484
00:39:15,700 --> 00:39:19,299
- Murph...
- You have no idea when you will return.

485
00:39:21,217 --> 00:39:24,603
- The idea!
- Murph.

486
00:39:26,111 --> 00:39:29,524
Do not make me leave like this.
Come on, Murph!

487
00:39:30,056 --> 00:39:32,400
Do not leave me like that, Murph!

488
00:39:41,700 --> 00:39:44,182
I love you're in for ever.

489
00:39:44,200 --> 00:39:47,095
Did you hear Me good?
I love you're in for ever.

490
00:39:47,340 --> 00:39:48,867
And I'll return.

491
00:39:54,903 --> 00:39:56,305
I will return.

492
00:40:14,427 --> 00:40:16,890
- How did it go?
- Well.

493
00:40:17,030 --> 00:40:18,121
He went well.

494
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:28,379
- -t Love, Tom.
- Travel with care, okay?

495
00:40:28,700 --> 00:40:30,791
Takes account of this
place for me, okay?

496
00:40:31,400 --> 00:40:33,046
- All right?
- All right.

497
00:40:37,698 --> 00:40:41,007
- Can I use the van while you are away?
- The one that now belongs to you?
