1
00:00:08,975 --> 00:00:11,136
(birds chirping)

2
00:00:18,585 --> 00:00:21,782
You said this was a shortcut.
If we'd kept to the road,

3
00:00:21,821 --> 00:00:24,312
- we'd be in Sentinum already.
- (growls)

4
00:00:27,293 --> 00:00:29,227
We're lost!

5
00:00:29,262 --> 00:00:32,095
No, we're not.
Just follow me.

6
00:00:36,603 --> 00:00:37,592
(bleats)

7
00:00:42,275 --> 00:00:43,572
Look at that.

8
00:00:44,577 --> 00:00:47,068
There must be
some hunters out here.

9
00:00:47,113 --> 00:00:49,104
Man:
I don't see anyone around.

10
00:00:49,149 --> 00:00:51,982
How about roast hare for supper?

11
00:00:52,018 --> 00:00:54,384
I say we take the lot.

12
00:00:54,421 --> 00:00:57,618
That sheepskin will fetch
a good price in Sentinum.

13
00:01:12,238 --> 00:01:14,399
(heavy footsteps,
creature snarling)

14
00:01:16,709 --> 00:01:20,304
- (creature snorts)
- (bleating)

15
00:01:21,314 --> 00:01:23,908
- (creature grunts, roars)
- Man: What's that?

16
00:01:23,950 --> 00:01:25,747
Aw, it's just an animal.

17
00:01:25,785 --> 00:01:27,013
(creature thuds)

18
00:01:29,389 --> 00:01:32,324
(growling)

19
00:01:33,827 --> 00:01:35,624
Oh...

20
00:01:40,767 --> 00:01:43,201
- (roars)
- It's a cyclops!

21
00:01:45,538 --> 00:01:48,507
(grunting)

22
00:01:50,610 --> 00:01:52,475
(screams)

23
00:02:06,126 --> 00:02:08,856
Let it go, Titus!
Let him have it.

24
00:02:27,480 --> 00:02:29,004
(roars)

25
00:02:50,503 --> 00:02:52,528
(people chatting)

26
00:03:03,283 --> 00:03:05,046
(neighs)

27
00:04:01,107 --> 00:04:04,975
By your look, Senators,
I see bad news travels fast.

28
00:04:05,011 --> 00:04:07,343
An alarming loss, Caesar.

29
00:04:07,380 --> 00:04:11,180
I think we should forbid transit through
the territory pending an investigation.

30
00:04:11,217 --> 00:04:14,948
That's not good enough, Casca.
The cyclops declared war on Rome

31
00:04:14,988 --> 00:04:17,548
- by murdering our citizens.
- My nephew's right.

32
00:04:17,590 --> 00:04:21,651
The only decision left to make,
Senators, is...

33
00:04:21,694 --> 00:04:24,128
whom do we send
after this monster?

34
00:04:24,163 --> 00:04:28,122
If Livius, our recently deceased
and much missed leader of the Senate,

35
00:04:28,167 --> 00:04:30,761
were here today,
I know what he would advise.

36
00:04:30,803 --> 00:04:34,204
He'd say, "Send the best
and bravest young officer.

37
00:04:34,240 --> 00:04:36,470
Send my son Marcus."

38
00:04:36,509 --> 00:04:40,172
Good idea, Casca. Tell Marcus
to assemble his troops right away.

39
00:04:40,213 --> 00:04:43,046
- I'll bring him the message myself.
- Good.

40
00:05:01,467 --> 00:05:03,367
(laughing)

41
00:05:07,707 --> 00:05:09,436
(gasps)

42
00:05:19,619 --> 00:05:22,452
Marcus, I thought I'd find you here.

43
00:05:22,488 --> 00:05:24,854
Marcus!

44
00:05:24,891 --> 00:05:26,518
(smacks)

45
00:05:28,961 --> 00:05:32,453
By the order of the Emperor Tiberius,
you are to set out at once

46
00:05:32,498 --> 00:05:36,594
to subdue a cyclops that ambushed
and killed two of our merchants.

47
00:05:36,636 --> 00:05:38,433
But of course, Falco.

48
00:05:38,471 --> 00:05:40,496
And would you like me to take care

49
00:05:40,540 --> 00:05:43,134
of that petrifying witch Medusa
on my way back?

50
00:05:43,176 --> 00:05:44,700
(chuckles)

51
00:05:44,744 --> 00:05:47,372
This is not a joke, Marcus.

52
00:05:47,413 --> 00:05:51,076
There's a cyclops out there.
It killed two of our merchants

53
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:54,678
and ate them. We know this
from the one man that survived...

54
00:05:54,721 --> 00:05:56,848
- Menander.
- (chokes)

55
00:05:56,889 --> 00:05:58,754
Menander?

56
00:05:58,791 --> 00:06:01,851
You could take anything he says
with a pinch of salt.

57
00:06:01,894 --> 00:06:05,728
The cyclops is a story told
by drunkards and beggars.

58
00:06:05,765 --> 00:06:07,960
Those beasts were
exterminated long ago

59
00:06:08,000 --> 00:06:10,332
when Augustus himself
wiped out the last of them.

60
00:06:10,370 --> 00:06:13,203
And even if
one cyclops did still exist,

61
00:06:13,239 --> 00:06:15,469
he's hardly a threat to Rome.

62
00:06:15,508 --> 00:06:17,942
That's not your decision
to make, is it?

63
00:06:19,779 --> 00:06:22,475
I suggest you muster
your men at once.

64
00:06:23,616 --> 00:06:25,140
(chair clatters)

65
00:06:25,184 --> 00:06:28,085
Apparently they'll have
to carry you up the road.

66
00:06:28,121 --> 00:06:30,749
The only way they'll ever
have to carry me

67
00:06:30,790 --> 00:06:33,418
is triumphant into Rome.

68
00:06:36,863 --> 00:06:39,423
Tell the Emperor Tiberius

69
00:06:39,465 --> 00:06:41,797
I salute him and obey.

70
00:06:43,503 --> 00:06:47,030
I don't think I've had the pleasure
of making your acquaintance.

71
00:06:47,073 --> 00:06:49,507
I am Falco Maximilius.

72
00:06:49,542 --> 00:06:53,205
- Flavia Corona.
- I'm delighted to meet you, Flavia.

73
00:06:53,246 --> 00:06:56,807
I've heard that you were the star
of the evening at Cato's Saturnalia.

74
00:06:56,849 --> 00:06:58,714
You know, I'm planning
an evening of my own.

75
00:06:58,751 --> 00:07:00,548
A symposium...

76
00:07:00,586 --> 00:07:02,520
just like Plato's...

77
00:07:03,856 --> 00:07:06,689
with the most distinguished
philosophers. And just one woman

78
00:07:06,726 --> 00:07:09,661
is invited to join us
in discourse on the art of love.

79
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,493
Would you be interested
in joining us, Flavia?

80
00:07:12,532 --> 00:07:14,557
Of course.

81
00:07:15,568 --> 00:07:18,128
(Marcus chuckles)

82
00:07:19,505 --> 00:07:22,235
Severus, fetch Tarquin
while I round up the others.

83
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:25,176
Sorry, Marcus, Tarquin paid me
to take a couple months' leave.

84
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,806
He paid you? If he wants leave,
he's supposed to pay me!

85
00:07:28,848 --> 00:07:31,817
I was going to pass it on to you,
but after a few drinks...

86
00:07:31,851 --> 00:07:34,012
I just...

87
00:07:35,221 --> 00:07:38,019
- Here's your money.
- But I don't want the money.

88
00:07:38,057 --> 00:07:40,355
I want the man,
so find him!

89
00:07:40,393 --> 00:07:42,418
And tell him to report
to duty at once.

90
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:44,054
Yes, sir.

91
00:07:44,096 --> 00:07:45,723
(sighs)

92
00:07:56,242 --> 00:07:58,073
Halt!

93
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:02,038
(bleating)

94
00:08:02,081 --> 00:08:05,744
Menander wasn't lying after all.
The cyclops ate them.

95
00:08:05,785 --> 00:08:07,844
The one thing Menander
wasn't lying about.

96
00:08:07,887 --> 00:08:11,345
He claimed the cyclops ambushed them
while they were looking for a shortcut.

97
00:08:11,390 --> 00:08:13,449
I think he saw them trying
to steal his food.

98
00:08:13,493 --> 00:08:15,893
There's some sheep too.
They probably tried to grab them.

99
00:08:15,928 --> 00:08:17,828
Severus: He could be lurking
around here anywhere.

100
00:08:17,864 --> 00:08:20,424
- Send scouts?
- No!

101
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:22,491
We flush him out.

102
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,027
Ho!

103
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:37,473
- Put the cloaks over your armor.
- Yes, sir.

104
00:09:11,117 --> 00:09:13,142
(bleating)

105
00:09:18,457 --> 00:09:20,516
(cyclops roaring)

106
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,693
Charge!

107
00:09:32,872 --> 00:09:34,965
(shouting)

108
00:09:51,757 --> 00:09:53,622
Adjust your aim!

109
00:09:56,095 --> 00:09:57,960
(blows whistle)

110
00:10:01,834 --> 00:10:03,233
Fire!

111
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,767
Pull it tightly!

112
00:10:40,806 --> 00:10:44,207
(cyclops grunting)

113
00:10:45,945 --> 00:10:47,810
No!

114
00:10:49,115 --> 00:10:51,015
I didn't order you to kill him.

115
00:10:51,050 --> 00:10:53,075
But your orders were
to subdue him, sir.

116
00:10:53,119 --> 00:10:56,384
That's right, so I'm going to bring
this beast back to Rome in chains.

117
00:10:56,422 --> 00:11:00,449
Let everyone see that Marcus Romulus
has subdued the cyclops.

118
00:11:00,493 --> 00:11:03,860
Tarquin, get the chains.

119
00:11:15,641 --> 00:11:17,268
Marcus:
Severus!

120
00:11:18,611 --> 00:11:21,444
No!

121
00:11:22,748 --> 00:11:25,581
Aim your spears
at his eye now!

122
00:11:33,492 --> 00:11:36,427
Shackle and blindfold him.

123
00:11:36,462 --> 00:11:38,657
(low growling)

124
00:11:47,673 --> 00:11:50,301
To Rome!

125
00:11:58,851 --> 00:12:01,285
Falco: I have
a little problem to tell you about.

126
00:12:01,320 --> 00:12:03,914
Saragosa is complaining
that he ordered

127
00:12:03,956 --> 00:12:05,890
two lions
and two tigers for the games.

128
00:12:05,925 --> 00:12:08,519
- Mm-hmm.
- But the cyclops attacked the caravan

129
00:12:08,561 --> 00:12:12,588
bringing them from Carthage.
Supposedly he tore the animals apart

130
00:12:12,631 --> 00:12:14,997
- and ate them.
- What a beast!

131
00:12:16,035 --> 00:12:18,799
- What's this?
- The price of the animals.

132
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,674
Saragosa expects me
to pay for them?

133
00:12:22,708 --> 00:12:25,268
They were killed
on a Roman road.

134
00:12:27,046 --> 00:12:28,775
Let's eat.

135
00:12:39,992 --> 00:12:42,290
Who are you?
Who sent you?

136
00:12:42,328 --> 00:12:45,263
He's Julia's son, Uncle.
Julia... your herbalist.

137
00:12:45,297 --> 00:12:46,992
I know who Julia is.

138
00:12:47,032 --> 00:12:50,195
Don't ever
creep up on me like that.

139
00:12:51,203 --> 00:12:53,467
Didn't your mother ever tell you?

140
00:12:53,506 --> 00:12:55,064
No?

141
00:12:56,742 --> 00:12:58,972
(chuckles)

142
00:12:59,011 --> 00:13:00,979
If I don't trust a yes-man,

143
00:13:01,013 --> 00:13:05,473
what do you think I feel about a man
who answers both yes and no

144
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:07,679
to the same question?

145
00:13:09,221 --> 00:13:13,021
Very shrewd, Uncle.
I'll have him flogged and sent away.

146
00:13:13,058 --> 00:13:16,050
So someone else can turn him
against me? No, Falco.

147
00:13:16,095 --> 00:13:19,155
He's so stupid,
he could be dangerous.

148
00:13:19,198 --> 00:13:22,634
He may be stupid, Uncle,
but he's also Julia's son,

149
00:13:22,668 --> 00:13:24,863
and she's been a good
and faithful servant.

150
00:13:24,904 --> 00:13:26,838
Hmm.

151
00:13:26,872 --> 00:13:28,669
What about his father?

152
00:13:30,776 --> 00:13:33,108
We can't be certain
who he was, can we?

153
00:13:33,145 --> 00:13:35,272
Exactly.

154
00:13:35,314 --> 00:13:37,179
So...
(clears throat)

155
00:13:42,621 --> 00:13:45,146
You're adding on to your new villa?

156
00:13:45,191 --> 00:13:47,125
Just a small addition.

157
00:13:47,159 --> 00:13:49,923
Nothing extravagant,
given the times we're living in.

158
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:52,021
Of course.

159
00:13:52,064 --> 00:13:55,295
Have that slave boy arrested
for assaulting me

160
00:13:55,334 --> 00:13:58,565
and then sell him to your overseer.

161
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:01,402
Girl, more wine.

162
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,516
Begone.

163
00:14:15,554 --> 00:14:17,784
(man and woman moaning)

164
00:14:22,595 --> 00:14:24,028
(knocks on door)

165
00:14:24,063 --> 00:14:26,429
Oh, wait.

166
00:14:26,465 --> 00:14:29,366
Wait wait.

167
00:14:39,478 --> 00:14:41,571
Come.

168
00:14:46,685 --> 00:14:49,950
Ah. It's about time
he showed up.

169
00:14:52,658 --> 00:14:54,888
Get rid of the girl.

170
00:14:54,927 --> 00:14:57,452
Make sure
she doesn't steal anything.

171
00:15:11,210 --> 00:15:13,201
(hammering)

172
00:15:21,153 --> 00:15:23,212
Cletus!

173
00:15:31,130 --> 00:15:33,963
You are six months
behind schedule

174
00:15:33,999 --> 00:15:36,559
and 20,000 denarii over budget.

175
00:15:36,602 --> 00:15:40,060
Give me one reason why
I shouldn't have you beaten

176
00:15:40,105 --> 00:15:44,064
and crucified in the middle
of the Forum for everyone to see.

177
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:46,976
A thousand pardons, Vizier.
With our armies fighting the Huns

178
00:15:47,012 --> 00:15:49,810
good slaves are hard to come by.
I will double my efforts.

179
00:15:49,848 --> 00:15:53,340
Everyone,
including Tiberius himself,

180
00:15:53,385 --> 00:15:56,582
knows about my renovations
because of your sloth.

181
00:15:59,058 --> 00:16:02,516
Be quick
before I lose my patience.

182
00:16:06,598 --> 00:16:08,190
(hammering)

183
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,366
(screams)

184
00:16:19,078 --> 00:16:22,047
You clumsy old fool.

185
00:16:22,081 --> 00:16:25,278
And that's for wasting
the time of two men.

186
00:16:25,317 --> 00:16:27,512
Cletus.

187
00:16:33,659 --> 00:16:36,059
Don't be a fool.

188
00:16:36,095 --> 00:16:38,689
You'll only get a public execution.

189
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,323
Back to work.

190
00:16:42,267 --> 00:16:44,292
(sobbing)

191
00:16:45,404 --> 00:16:47,964
Barbara, bring me a hot one.

192
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,367
Hey, you, farmer boy!

193
00:16:52,411 --> 00:16:54,242
Come on, burn it.

194
00:16:58,717 --> 00:17:00,548
(whimpers)

195
00:17:02,254 --> 00:17:04,449
Julian.

196
00:17:04,490 --> 00:17:07,186
Boy, get on with it!

197
00:17:07,226 --> 00:17:08,716
(grunts)

198
00:17:08,761 --> 00:17:11,059
(shrieking)

199
00:17:11,096 --> 00:17:13,326
Now work him.

200
00:17:15,100 --> 00:17:19,969
(wails, crying)

201
00:17:21,006 --> 00:17:23,440
We all have to answer
to the name "boy" here,

202
00:17:23,475 --> 00:17:25,773
but you are Julian,

203
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,472
and I am Gordian.

204
00:17:29,048 --> 00:17:31,141
Put this on.

205
00:17:39,391 --> 00:17:41,188
(horse neighs)

206
00:17:48,567 --> 00:17:50,364
I don't see Marcus.
Do you, my dear?

207
00:17:57,009 --> 00:17:59,239
If he'd succeeded
in subduing the cyclops,

208
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:01,041
he'd be leading his troops
in triumph.

209
00:18:06,585 --> 00:18:08,485
Guard!

210
00:18:10,055 --> 00:18:12,615
Go warn the emperor
it's bad news.

211
00:18:12,658 --> 00:18:15,422
Marcus Romulus has failed.

212
00:18:15,461 --> 00:18:17,053
Go!

213
00:18:20,666 --> 00:18:22,531
(crowd cheering)

214
00:18:31,143 --> 00:18:33,168
(cyclops growling, roaring)

215
00:18:40,419 --> 00:18:43,650
Boy, stop the guard from telling
the emperor that Marcus has failed

216
00:18:43,689 --> 00:18:45,816
or I'll look like a fool. Run!

217
00:18:50,362 --> 00:18:52,159
Flavia!

218
00:18:52,197 --> 00:18:54,188
What are you doing?

219
00:18:54,233 --> 00:18:56,758
I'm going to see what Marcus
has under his blanket.

220
00:18:56,802 --> 00:18:58,235
The cyclops perhaps?

221
00:19:14,353 --> 00:19:16,082
- (cyclops roars)
- (screams)

222
00:19:21,026 --> 00:19:23,290
Citizens of Rome!

223
00:19:23,328 --> 00:19:25,455
I have returned

224
00:19:25,497 --> 00:19:27,294
and I bring with me

225
00:19:27,332 --> 00:19:31,462
the beast that has been
terrorizing our countryside.

226
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:34,131
I give to you

227
00:19:34,173 --> 00:19:37,165
- the cyclops!
- (loud cheering)

228
00:19:38,410 --> 00:19:40,605
(roaring)

229
00:20:09,308 --> 00:20:11,708
(crowd laughing)

230
00:20:11,743 --> 00:20:13,734
Shoo! Go away.

231
00:20:37,336 --> 00:20:39,702
I congratulate you, Marcus.

232
00:20:39,738 --> 00:20:42,138
You and your troops acquitted
yourselves well.

233
00:20:42,174 --> 00:20:45,109
Thanks to you

234
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:48,044
another enemy
of Rome is in chains.

235
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,344
(whispers)

236
00:20:50,382 --> 00:20:52,509
Ah yes.

237
00:20:53,652 --> 00:20:55,517
I just have one question.

238
00:20:56,755 --> 00:21:01,385
Why did your second-in-command lead
the triumphal return to Rome?

239
00:21:01,426 --> 00:21:04,327
I sent him ahead to escort
my fallen comrades,

240
00:21:04,363 --> 00:21:07,196
so that the proper honor
and respect was paid to them.

241
00:21:07,232 --> 00:21:09,826
You see, I knew that once
the crowd saw me

242
00:21:09,868 --> 00:21:12,234
lead the cyclops captive into Rome,

243
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:15,035
- it would be a circus.
- Hmm.

244
00:21:15,073 --> 00:21:17,303
And quite a circus
it was, huh, Falco?

245
00:21:17,342 --> 00:21:21,142
In that case, I commend you...
and promote you

246
00:21:21,179 --> 00:21:23,477
to the rank of tribune.

247
00:21:23,515 --> 00:21:25,483
I thank you, Caesar.

248
00:21:30,889 --> 00:21:33,653
I believe it is customary
for a land grant...

249
00:21:33,692 --> 00:21:36,752
a modest land grant
to be awarded.

250
00:21:36,795 --> 00:21:39,491
You've just been elevated to tribune

251
00:21:39,531 --> 00:21:42,591
and you have the effrontery
to ask for more?

252
00:21:42,634 --> 00:21:46,092
I'm simply asking for what I deserve
and for what is customary.

253
00:21:46,138 --> 00:21:48,072
But if it is a question
between the two,

254
00:21:48,106 --> 00:21:50,574
I would rather have the land
than the title, Caesar.

255
00:21:50,609 --> 00:21:54,238
The Emperor Tiberius
rewards as he sees fit.

256
00:21:54,279 --> 00:21:57,407
And what the emperor gives,
he can also take away.

257
00:21:57,449 --> 00:22:01,909
There will be no land grant
and I revoke the promotion.

258
00:22:01,953 --> 00:22:04,922
Falco:
Dismissed...

259
00:22:04,956 --> 00:22:05,945
Centurion.

260
00:22:23,709 --> 00:22:27,042
Fine, now let's go over the menu
for the banquet.

261
00:22:27,079 --> 00:22:30,071
Rome's victory over the cyclops
calls for boar as the main dish.

262
00:22:30,115 --> 00:22:32,140
- Half a boar.
- What?

263
00:22:32,184 --> 00:22:35,449
A whole boar split lengthwise...
serve one half, store the other.

264
00:22:35,487 --> 00:22:38,320
- Don't you think that'll look silly?
- Excuse me?

265
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:42,487
Anyway, half a boar isn't going to serve
all the guests we've invited.

266
00:22:42,527 --> 00:22:45,519
Then split the guests...
put the first tier in the dining room,

267
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,091
second tier in the annex.
Serve the second tier eggs and greens.

268
00:22:49,134 --> 00:22:50,897
(chuckles)

269
00:22:50,936 --> 00:22:55,236
Put Marcus in the second tier.

270
00:22:55,273 --> 00:22:57,605
Ah.

271
00:23:00,045 --> 00:23:02,138
- (cyclops growling)
- (crowd laughing)

272
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:48,518
(screaming)

273
00:23:58,537 --> 00:24:01,665
(wood creaking)

274
00:24:22,260 --> 00:24:25,058
Cyclops, no!
Stop right there.

275
00:24:33,638 --> 00:24:35,663
(shrieking)

276
00:24:43,748 --> 00:24:45,773
(chomping)

277
00:24:46,952 --> 00:24:49,580
- Stop him, Caesar.
- Caesar: Stop!

278
00:24:51,189 --> 00:24:53,521
Do not kill the creature.

279
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,492
(chomping continues)

280
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:12,875
I think he was hungry.

281
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:18,245
You're right. Find the butcher,
tell him to bring meat...

282
00:25:18,283 --> 00:25:20,513
the biggest cuts he's got.

283
00:25:27,425 --> 00:25:30,690
Now why did you want me
to save that awful creature?

284
00:25:30,729 --> 00:25:33,095
I have an idea for you
to save some money

285
00:25:33,131 --> 00:25:35,429
- on the games.
- Really?

286
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:37,958
- What?
- Throw the cyclops into the arena.

287
00:25:38,003 --> 00:25:42,201
Hmm. I shall have to pay to put
the gladiators up against him though.

288
00:25:42,240 --> 00:25:46,301
Not if the man-eating cyclops is pitted
against the vilest criminals in Rome.

289
00:25:46,344 --> 00:25:49,245
It would be far more entertaining
than executing them

290
00:25:49,281 --> 00:25:51,772
and the public will love it.

291
00:25:51,816 --> 00:25:53,443
It's a good idea, Falco.

292
00:25:53,485 --> 00:25:56,613
We'll start with the lowest of the low...
Cletus's convict slaves.

293
00:25:56,655 --> 00:25:59,317
- No, but they're building my villa.
- Easily replaced.

294
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:02,656
- You think Rome is short of slaves?
- Well, actually...

295
00:26:05,964 --> 00:26:08,865
- Are you disagreeing with me?
- No...

296
00:26:08,900 --> 00:26:10,800
Emperor.

297
00:26:10,835 --> 00:26:13,235
- Cletus's slaves it shall be.
- Good.

298
00:26:31,856 --> 00:26:33,824
We have new orders.

299
00:26:33,858 --> 00:26:36,486
They want him hungry.

300
00:26:37,996 --> 00:26:40,123
(cyclops roars)

301
00:26:40,165 --> 00:26:42,395
(growling)

302
00:26:51,242 --> 00:26:54,370
- Any sign of Barbara?
- I don't see her.

303
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,741
- Hey, shut up!
- (spear clanks)

304
00:27:02,020 --> 00:27:04,545
Guard!

305
00:27:05,924 --> 00:27:07,516
- Guard!
- (banging)

306
00:27:07,559 --> 00:27:09,754
- What do you want now?
- Where's our bread?

307
00:27:09,794 --> 00:27:12,558
You tell Cletus if we don't eat,
we can't work.

308
00:27:12,597 --> 00:27:14,292
He don't care.

309
00:27:14,332 --> 00:27:16,300
Barbara?

310
00:27:17,369 --> 00:27:19,894
Barbara!

311
00:27:19,938 --> 00:27:21,405
Yes?

312
00:27:23,208 --> 00:27:25,108
Get on with it.

313
00:27:25,143 --> 00:27:27,043
Of course.

314
00:27:37,422 --> 00:27:39,117
Higher.

315
00:27:49,234 --> 00:27:51,702
Higher.

316
00:27:59,844 --> 00:28:02,108
Higher and more pressure.

317
00:28:09,688 --> 00:28:11,656
(crunching)

318
00:28:11,690 --> 00:28:13,715
(gasping)

319
00:28:13,758 --> 00:28:15,783
Barbarian...

320
00:28:15,827 --> 00:28:18,057
you wanna play rough, do you?

321
00:28:18,096 --> 00:28:20,223
(grunting)

322
00:28:20,265 --> 00:28:22,631
You want me to beat you?

323
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,636
The slaves haven't eaten.

324
00:28:25,670 --> 00:28:27,831
Shouldn't I bring them
their bread?

325
00:28:27,872 --> 00:28:30,534
No.

326
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,702
But they'll be
too weak to work.

327
00:28:37,615 --> 00:28:39,242
They won't have to.

328
00:28:41,386 --> 00:28:43,513
Barbara?

329
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,560
(rooster crows)

330
00:29:21,593 --> 00:29:24,187
You there! Halt.

331
00:29:37,475 --> 00:29:40,035
- Gordian...
- No talking!

332
00:29:40,078 --> 00:29:42,410
No, please, I saved
the biggest one for Gordian.

333
00:29:42,447 --> 00:29:45,177
- Why?
- It... it's his birthday.

334
00:29:45,216 --> 00:29:47,946
(chuckles)
Yeah, his last one.

335
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:52,578
Well then, make the most of it.

336
00:30:09,908 --> 00:30:11,899
What is this?

337
00:30:11,943 --> 00:30:13,570
A love letter from Barbara?

338
00:30:14,612 --> 00:30:16,603
She can't write.

339
00:30:16,648 --> 00:30:19,446
- She can't draw either.
- The message is clear enough:

340
00:30:19,484 --> 00:30:21,577
We're to be thrown into the arena.

341
00:30:23,788 --> 00:30:26,154
Our only hope now is escape.

342
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:37,368
(cyclops grunting softly)

343
00:30:44,042 --> 00:30:47,068
Shut up, you one-eyed bastard.

344
00:30:48,613 --> 00:30:51,138
(snorts)
That's what I thought.

345
00:30:51,182 --> 00:30:54,151
Bark's worse than your bite.
The big ones always are.

346
00:31:12,537 --> 00:31:14,767
Oh ho ho ho!

347
00:31:14,806 --> 00:31:17,138
(men laughing)

348
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,251
(man whistles)

349
00:31:46,371 --> 00:31:48,635
- All of it.
- (grunts)

350
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:56,540
(chatting)

351
00:32:14,265 --> 00:32:15,732
(pot smashes)

352
00:32:18,136 --> 00:32:19,660
(roars)

353
00:32:19,704 --> 00:32:21,797
(men gasping)

354
00:32:44,595 --> 00:32:46,358
(chomps)

355
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:49,732
(roars)

356
00:33:07,952 --> 00:33:11,012
- (flies buzzing)
- Oh my God!

357
00:33:11,055 --> 00:33:13,956
Get the troops.
Tell them the cyclops is loose

358
00:33:13,992 --> 00:33:16,290
and it's killing people.
Now run!

359
00:33:36,247 --> 00:33:38,477
Barbara!

360
00:34:00,471 --> 00:34:03,599
- Where do you think you're off to?
- The cyclops is loose.

361
00:34:03,641 --> 00:34:05,472
He's killing people
and eating them.

362
00:34:10,848 --> 00:34:14,375
Good job. Now you run home
and stay inside, okay?

363
00:34:15,653 --> 00:34:17,450
He's gonna try and leave the city.

364
00:34:17,488 --> 00:34:19,513
I want you to alert
the guards at the gate.

365
00:34:19,557 --> 00:34:22,754
We'll split our forces...
you flush out the neighborhood

366
00:34:22,794 --> 00:34:25,922
east of the Temple of Jupiter,
I'll scour the western sector.

367
00:34:26,931 --> 00:34:30,128
Tarquin, keep the people
off the streets.

368
00:34:30,168 --> 00:34:33,535
I don't want another person
killed by that cyclops.

369
00:34:33,571 --> 00:34:36,870
The rest of you with me!

370
00:34:44,148 --> 00:34:46,207
Cletus:
Barbara.

371
00:34:46,250 --> 00:34:48,275
(basket thuds)

372
00:34:51,355 --> 00:34:54,153
Come here. There's nothing
to be afraid of,

373
00:34:54,192 --> 00:34:56,626
- unless you lie to me.
- (cyclops grunts)

374
00:34:58,663 --> 00:35:00,255
Back!

375
00:35:01,265 --> 00:35:03,165
Back!

376
00:35:10,775 --> 00:35:13,243
Open it up... quickly!

377
00:35:13,277 --> 00:35:15,177
(keys jangle)

378
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:22,886
- Open the door!
- (roars)

379
00:35:22,920 --> 00:35:25,548
No! Let me in!

380
00:36:00,791 --> 00:36:02,759
(cyclops departing)

381
00:36:10,368 --> 00:36:12,666
Move!

382
00:36:19,243 --> 00:36:21,871
Now's our chance...

383
00:36:21,913 --> 00:36:24,177
while the troops are going
after the cyclops.

384
00:36:26,017 --> 00:36:28,417
In case anyone sees us,
the story is...

385
00:36:31,722 --> 00:36:34,691
I am your owner now,
leading you to safety

386
00:36:34,725 --> 00:36:36,818
and away from the cyclops.

387
00:37:12,797 --> 00:37:15,288
- (arrows flying)
- (roars)

388
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:17,130
Column, march!

389
00:37:33,751 --> 00:37:35,548
Archers!

390
00:37:37,188 --> 00:37:38,553
(screams)

391
00:38:00,478 --> 00:38:02,446
Halt!

392
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:05,608
Archers, bring up the ballista.

393
00:38:12,189 --> 00:38:15,283
Cyclops, surrender or die!

394
00:38:16,727 --> 00:38:18,558
(roars)

395
00:38:22,466 --> 00:38:24,366
Fire!

396
00:38:37,315 --> 00:38:40,079
He's still alive.
Shall I kill him?

397
00:38:40,117 --> 00:38:41,675
No.

398
00:38:41,719 --> 00:38:44,517
The Emperor Tiberius forbids it.

399
00:38:44,555 --> 00:38:48,491
Just make sure you secure him
properly this time.

400
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,595
Yes, sir.

401
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:34,905
(door clangs, rattles)

402
00:39:42,113 --> 00:39:44,104
- (cyclops roars)
- No!

403
00:39:45,649 --> 00:39:48,641
Cyclops, no.

404
00:39:49,920 --> 00:39:53,481
You are never getting
out of here again.

405
00:39:55,126 --> 00:39:56,957
- (roars)
- Sir?

406
00:39:56,994 --> 00:40:00,760
Tiberius summons you.
There has been a slave uprising.

407
00:40:01,899 --> 00:40:03,526
(sighs)

408
00:40:16,414 --> 00:40:18,245
I warned all of you.

409
00:40:18,282 --> 00:40:22,218
As long as Marcus remains in the guard,
there is incompetence.

410
00:40:23,320 --> 00:40:25,515
From now on, listen to me.

411
00:40:25,556 --> 00:40:28,525
Remember that.

412
00:40:30,060 --> 00:40:32,722
The scum of the earth...

413
00:40:32,763 --> 00:40:36,529
slaves convicted of crimes
against their masters

414
00:40:36,567 --> 00:40:39,400
and sentenced to hard labor

415
00:40:39,437 --> 00:40:42,634
murdered my overseer Cletus

416
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:45,699
when he was bringing them
extra bread

417
00:40:45,743 --> 00:40:49,509
out of the kindness of his heart.

418
00:40:49,547 --> 00:40:52,539
They found the loaves
on the prison floor,

419
00:40:52,583 --> 00:40:55,381
stained with his blood.

420
00:40:55,419 --> 00:40:58,513
They slit his throat
with his own key.

421
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,394
(panting)
You sent for me.

422
00:41:04,428 --> 00:41:07,795
I hope you've managed to secure
your prisoner this time, Marcus.

423
00:41:07,832 --> 00:41:10,300
The slaves would never have
escaped the city

424
00:41:10,334 --> 00:41:13,360
if the entire garrison
hadn't been deployed

425
00:41:13,404 --> 00:41:15,235
to recapture the cyclops.

426
00:41:15,272 --> 00:41:17,240
True, Falco. True true.

427
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:22,402
There's no time to lose. I'm dispatching
you and Marcus immediately

428
00:41:22,446 --> 00:41:24,914
to capture these murdering slaves.

429
00:41:24,949 --> 00:41:27,110
Show them no mercy.

430
00:41:27,151 --> 00:41:31,485
Give them no quarter but bring back
as many as you can alive.

431
00:41:31,522 --> 00:41:33,717
I want all of Rome

432
00:41:33,757 --> 00:41:36,385
to watch them die in the arena.

433
00:41:37,428 --> 00:41:39,055
One more thing:

434
00:41:41,432 --> 00:41:43,957
Since Marcus has been demoted,

435
00:41:44,001 --> 00:41:47,061
you, Falco, will be
commanding officer.

436
00:41:47,104 --> 00:41:50,369
Marcus will follow your orders.

437
00:41:52,676 --> 00:41:55,406
Now go
make yourselves heroes.

438
00:42:12,429 --> 00:42:14,863
They must be heading for the harbor,

439
00:42:14,899 --> 00:42:17,265
thinking they can trust
the Greeks to ship them out.

440
00:42:17,301 --> 00:42:19,326
Maybe this lot's
smarter than you think.

441
00:42:19,370 --> 00:42:21,201
They could take the pass into Gaul.

442
00:42:21,238 --> 00:42:23,638
Wait for my order!

443
00:42:24,975 --> 00:42:26,966
I'm waiting.

444
00:42:27,978 --> 00:42:30,242
Follow me.

445
00:42:53,304 --> 00:42:55,329
There they are.

446
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,999
They're nowhere near
the harbor road.

447
00:42:59,043 --> 00:43:02,308
If you were a runaway slave,
would you take a Roman road?

448
00:43:04,114 --> 00:43:07,345
This is easy. We can
catch them in a pincer movement.

449
00:43:32,543 --> 00:43:35,137
Come on, Julian, you can...

450
00:43:41,185 --> 00:43:43,881
(shrieking)

451
00:43:45,856 --> 00:43:48,347
Charge! With me!

452
00:44:42,613 --> 00:44:44,604
Easy, tiger.

453
00:44:56,960 --> 00:44:59,588
Cletus's ring.

454
00:45:01,365 --> 00:45:03,959
So you're the one that killed him.

455
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,333
Guards,

456
00:45:06,370 --> 00:45:08,065
crucify him.

457
00:45:15,612 --> 00:45:17,876
- Chain her.
- (spits)

458
00:45:18,916 --> 00:45:21,544
Go and hurry them up.

459
00:45:22,853 --> 00:45:25,287
Gordian? Stop!

460
00:45:29,693 --> 00:45:33,151
Gordian, I freed you.

461
00:45:34,198 --> 00:45:36,166
I failed.

462
00:45:36,200 --> 00:45:39,363
I tried to farm... wrong place,

463
00:45:39,403 --> 00:45:41,371
drought and debt,

464
00:45:41,405 --> 00:45:43,965
creditors sold me.

465
00:45:46,977 --> 00:45:49,275
- You don't deserve this.
- What do you think you're doing?

466
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:51,406
This man was my slave.
I freed him once,

467
00:45:51,448 --> 00:45:53,643
I'm freeing him again.
He's not a criminal.

468
00:45:53,684 --> 00:45:56,551
He killed my overseer
and led the slave revolt.

469
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,485
I found another one.
He was playing dead.

470
00:46:01,525 --> 00:46:04,426
Julian.
I defended you to the emperor

471
00:46:04,461 --> 00:46:07,726
and you show me your gratitude
by joining the uprising.

472
00:46:07,765 --> 00:46:11,360
- Gordian didn't kill Cletus.
- Liar!

473
00:46:11,401 --> 00:46:14,837
Tiberius was right. You'd stick a knife
in any of us if you had the chance.

474
00:46:14,872 --> 00:46:18,137
It's a waste not to use
a perfectly good cross,

475
00:46:18,175 --> 00:46:19,938
isn't it?

476
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:26,308
When they throw him into the arena
to face the cyclops,

477
00:46:26,350 --> 00:46:28,648
you're gonna wish
you'd let him die on the cross.

478
00:46:31,121 --> 00:46:33,612
He looks like a good fighter.

479
00:46:33,657 --> 00:46:36,683
Take him away and deliver him
to the gladiators' quarters.

480
00:46:36,727 --> 00:46:38,786
Deliver the rest of them
to the dungeon.

481
00:46:42,366 --> 00:46:44,357
And as for you...

482
00:46:46,804 --> 00:46:48,601
you're under arrest...

483
00:46:50,541 --> 00:46:53,374
for disobeying the orders
of your commanding officer...

484
00:46:53,410 --> 00:46:55,742
and Tiberius.

485
00:47:06,924 --> 00:47:08,391
Follow.

486
00:47:41,825 --> 00:47:43,554
Marcus Romulus,

487
00:47:43,594 --> 00:47:46,654
Centurion.

488
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:51,633
You defied the direct order of Falco,
your commanding officer,

489
00:47:51,668 --> 00:47:54,193
by deliberately freeing
Cletus's murderer

490
00:47:54,238 --> 00:47:56,138
and a leader of the slave revolt.

491
00:47:56,173 --> 00:47:59,040
I find you guilty of treason.

492
00:48:00,043 --> 00:48:01,943
Now treason

493
00:48:01,979 --> 00:48:04,209
is punishable by death.

494
00:48:05,816 --> 00:48:09,616
However, in honor of your late father's
services to Rome,

495
00:48:09,653 --> 00:48:12,417
I grant you
a choice of punishment:

496
00:48:13,824 --> 00:48:15,883
Decimation of your troops...

497
00:48:15,926 --> 00:48:19,327
Every other man, step forward.

498
00:48:23,333 --> 00:48:26,769
Every remaining man,
execute them on my order.

499
00:48:28,639 --> 00:48:31,767
...or you can volunteer

500
00:48:31,808 --> 00:48:34,709
- to be a gladiator.
- I volunteer.

501
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:37,509
My men have committed no crime.

502
00:48:37,547 --> 00:48:40,380
And since you won't allow me
to fight as a soldier,

503
00:48:40,417 --> 00:48:43,614
- I'll fight in the arena.
- Yes, you will.

504
00:48:43,654 --> 00:48:46,487
Starting tomorrow

505
00:48:46,523 --> 00:48:48,957
at my Victory Games.

506
00:49:09,980 --> 00:49:11,880
The entire lot of them, sir?

507
00:49:22,225 --> 00:49:24,318
Wait!

508
00:49:25,429 --> 00:49:27,397
Wait!

509
00:49:30,734 --> 00:49:32,725
Unchain her from the rest.

510
00:49:43,480 --> 00:49:45,778
(cyclops grunting)

511
00:49:53,357 --> 00:49:55,348
(roaring)

512
00:50:16,580 --> 00:50:18,946
Look at me.

513
00:50:21,318 --> 00:50:23,878
Cletus used you
for construction?

514
00:50:23,920 --> 00:50:26,548
No, I cooked for him.

515
00:50:27,991 --> 00:50:30,186
You'd certainly whet
any man's appetite.

516
00:50:49,813 --> 00:50:51,474
Attention!

517
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,986
Strip him.

518
00:51:04,027 --> 00:51:06,257
Sword.

519
00:51:16,440 --> 00:51:18,374
Take him away.

520
00:51:22,813 --> 00:51:24,610
Turn around.

521
00:51:30,854 --> 00:51:32,822
We've enough
to throw at the cyclops,

522
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:36,485
but I could use another whore
to service the gladiators.

523
00:51:36,526 --> 00:51:39,461
Very good. Take her.

524
00:51:52,175 --> 00:51:55,804
Ah. Is everything ready
for tomorrow?

525
00:51:55,846 --> 00:51:57,473
- Yes.
- Good.

526
00:51:57,514 --> 00:52:00,415
And you brought the accounting
of the expenses to date?

527
00:52:06,590 --> 00:52:09,286
Mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm.

528
00:52:09,326 --> 00:52:11,089
What's this?

529
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:14,586
An entire lamb for the cyclops?
Why are we feeding him?

530
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:19,228
He eats his guards if we don't.

531
00:52:19,269 --> 00:52:22,705
- Let's find him some cheaper meat.
- No problem, Uncle.

532
00:52:26,276 --> 00:52:28,403
(crowd cheering)

533
00:52:31,214 --> 00:52:34,775
Citizens and free men of Rome,

534
00:52:34,818 --> 00:52:38,276
welcome to the best, the biggest,

535
00:52:38,321 --> 00:52:41,586
the most spectacular
gladiatorial games

536
00:52:41,625 --> 00:52:45,652
ever presented
by your great Emperor Tiberius!

537
00:52:45,695 --> 00:52:47,754
(cheering)

538
00:52:51,601 --> 00:52:54,126
Three days of fights to the death

539
00:52:54,171 --> 00:52:56,639
between the bravest of gladiators,

540
00:52:56,673 --> 00:52:59,164
- three days of...
- Come on, go on!

541
00:52:59,209 --> 00:53:00,972
- Get on with it!
- But there is more.

542
00:53:01,011 --> 00:53:02,911
He's an arrogant bastard,
isn't he?

543
00:53:02,946 --> 00:53:05,938
You've seen
men torn apart by tigers,

544
00:53:05,982 --> 00:53:09,247
you've seen
men devoured by lions,

545
00:53:09,286 --> 00:53:13,313
but now, for the first time ever,
right here

546
00:53:13,356 --> 00:53:15,324
you will see men face off

547
00:53:15,358 --> 00:53:18,657
against a far more terrifying
beast of prey,

548
00:53:18,695 --> 00:53:22,096
bigger than any man on earth:

549
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:25,124
In all his fighting fury,

550
00:53:25,168 --> 00:53:29,127
the legendary,
the one-eyed cyclops!

551
00:53:32,375 --> 00:53:35,742
But first,
the murderous slaves.

552
00:53:37,147 --> 00:53:40,412
What shall be their fate?
Hanging?

553
00:53:40,450 --> 00:53:42,714
Crucifixion?

554
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:45,653
- Or the cyclops?!
- (cheering)

555
00:53:46,723 --> 00:53:49,055
- Louder.
- (chanting) Cyclops! Cyclops!

556
00:53:49,092 --> 00:53:51,026
Cyclops! Cyclops!

557
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:54,656
Cyclops! Cyclops!
Cyclops. Cyclops.

558
00:53:54,698 --> 00:53:58,862
Seeing as how our emperor
is a fair and generous man,

559
00:53:58,902 --> 00:54:03,271
he has decided to give
the slaves a fighting chance.

560
00:54:03,306 --> 00:54:06,207
They shall be given one sword

561
00:54:06,243 --> 00:54:08,973
and one shield.

562
00:54:12,048 --> 00:54:14,539
(slaves muttering)

563
00:54:15,752 --> 00:54:17,219
(laughing)

564
00:54:24,861 --> 00:54:26,556
Man:
Bring on the cyclops!

565
00:54:29,666 --> 00:54:31,634
(cyclops roaring)

566
00:56:05,962 --> 00:56:10,490
Don't worry, citizens, the cyclops never
bites off more than he can chew.

567
00:56:11,668 --> 00:56:12,965
(roaring)

568
00:56:17,207 --> 00:56:20,233
Please please, stay in your seats.

569
00:56:21,277 --> 00:56:25,646
Our generous emperor has agreed
to provide a few lucky citizens

570
00:56:25,682 --> 00:56:28,207
vouchers for free food

571
00:56:28,251 --> 00:56:30,685
- during the intermission.
- (cheering)

572
00:56:49,839 --> 00:56:52,967
- Can he spare it?
- (giggling)

573
00:56:55,745 --> 00:56:58,339
What are you laughing at?

574
00:56:58,381 --> 00:57:00,542
What did he say?

575
00:57:01,918 --> 00:57:04,045
He said it's a wonderful idea.

576
00:57:04,087 --> 00:57:07,887
It cost you so little, Tiberius,
and it means so much to them.

577
00:57:24,274 --> 00:57:26,606
Gordian, wine?

578
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:30,703
Sit, please.
We're equals now.

579
00:57:32,282 --> 00:57:34,807
Equals? No.

580
00:57:34,851 --> 00:57:36,978
I was born a slave,

581
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:40,683
sentenced to die as a criminal.
You were condemned to be a gladiator

582
00:57:40,723 --> 00:57:42,714
only because you tried to save me.

583
00:57:42,759 --> 00:57:44,852
I should have
enlisted you in the army

584
00:57:44,894 --> 00:57:47,294
instead of freeing you
to fail as a farmer.

585
00:57:47,330 --> 00:57:49,525
At least I had the chance
to fight for my life,

586
00:57:49,566 --> 00:57:51,727
unlike my fellow slaves.

587
00:57:51,768 --> 00:57:54,601
We tried to escape because we were
condemned to die in the arena.

588
00:57:54,637 --> 00:57:59,336
Perhaps we can't escape
our fate, Marcus.

589
00:57:59,375 --> 00:58:01,366
We're not here
because of fate, Gordian.

590
00:58:01,411 --> 00:58:04,346
- We're here because of Tiberius.
- Ringmaster: Gladiators!

591
00:58:04,380 --> 00:58:07,781
The finest priestesses

592
00:58:07,817 --> 00:58:11,082
from the Temple of Venus
at your command.

593
00:58:23,333 --> 00:58:24,857
Barbara!

594
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:29,970
She tried to help us... got me word
we were to be thrown into the arena.

595
00:58:40,116 --> 00:58:42,209
Nuh-uh-uh!
No no no.

596
00:58:43,419 --> 00:58:45,853
I'll take this one.

597
00:58:45,889 --> 00:58:48,380
I like a fighter.

598
00:59:09,379 --> 00:59:13,110
So fighting slaves and barbarians
isn't enough for you

599
00:59:13,149 --> 00:59:15,743
that you also spend
your off-duty time in the arena?

600
00:59:16,819 --> 00:59:18,446
It's hardly a choice.

601
00:59:18,488 --> 00:59:20,718
I was condemned
to fight as a gladiator

602
00:59:20,757 --> 00:59:23,317
- as punishment for my treason.
- What did you do?

603
00:59:23,359 --> 00:59:27,193
Falco tried to crucify Gordian
for a crime he didn't commit.

604
00:59:27,230 --> 00:59:29,198
I chose to free him.

605
00:59:30,233 --> 00:59:32,030
Barbara, huh?

606
00:59:32,068 --> 00:59:33,729
Beautiful name.

607
00:59:35,838 --> 00:59:38,932
It means
savage and uncivilized.

608
00:59:38,975 --> 00:59:41,944
To me it means
pride and courage.

609
00:59:41,978 --> 00:59:44,503
I have never seen
a woman fight like you do.

610
00:59:44,547 --> 00:59:47,038
I had nothing to lose.

611
00:59:47,083 --> 00:59:48,983
I'd rather die fighting to be free

612
00:59:49,018 --> 00:59:51,885
than die in the arena
torn apart by the cyclops

613
00:59:51,921 --> 00:59:56,187
- to amuse the Romans.
- Me, I'd rather fight to win.

614
00:59:56,225 --> 00:59:59,683
- And claim me as your prize?
- Not as my prize,

615
00:59:59,729 --> 01:00:02,289
as my ally...

616
01:00:02,332 --> 01:00:05,028
against Tiberius and Falco.

617
01:00:13,743 --> 01:00:15,938
(crowd murmuring)

618
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:23,348
Ringmaster:
Citizens, hold onto your seats

619
01:00:23,386 --> 01:00:27,186
for the big event
of this second day of Victory Games.

620
01:00:27,223 --> 01:00:29,885
(cheering)

621
01:00:47,877 --> 01:00:51,404
Citizens, a special announcement.

622
01:00:51,447 --> 01:00:53,176
Marcus!

623
01:00:56,019 --> 01:00:59,318
Ringmaster:
For the final day of the Victory Games,

624
01:00:59,355 --> 01:01:02,518
two gladiators
new to this arena...

625
01:01:05,328 --> 01:01:07,193
I'll see you tonight.

626
01:01:08,464 --> 01:01:12,195
...Marcus and Gordian will face off

627
01:01:12,235 --> 01:01:15,898
in a fight to the death.

628
01:01:15,938 --> 01:01:17,667
(crowd roars)

629
01:01:53,509 --> 01:01:56,501
(crowd chanting)
Marcus, Marcus, Marcus...

630
01:02:02,452 --> 01:02:04,943
I'm betting on the handsome one.

631
01:02:06,155 --> 01:02:09,147
- Falco: Which one do you mean?
- Flavia: The one with the net.

632
01:03:25,268 --> 01:03:27,031
He's done for.

633
01:04:01,504 --> 01:04:04,439
(chanting)
Live live live live live!

634
01:04:53,689 --> 01:04:58,023
Citizens, a special announcement:

635
01:04:58,060 --> 01:05:01,427
For the final day
of the Victory Games,

636
01:05:01,464 --> 01:05:06,367
three pairs of gladiators
chosen by lot

637
01:05:06,402 --> 01:05:08,233
shall fight to the death.

638
01:05:08,271 --> 01:05:11,263
Our gracious Emperor Tiberius

639
01:05:11,307 --> 01:05:15,403
decrees that
the victorious gladiators

640
01:05:15,444 --> 01:05:17,639
shall be granted freedom!

641
01:05:17,680 --> 01:05:19,910
(cheering)

642
01:05:21,083 --> 01:05:24,211
- Free Marcus!
- (crowd chanting) Free Marcus!

643
01:05:24,253 --> 01:05:26,312
Free Marcus!
Free Marcus!

644
01:05:26,355 --> 01:05:29,347
Free Marcus! Free Marcus!

645
01:05:29,392 --> 01:05:31,792
Free Marcus!
Free Marcus!

646
01:05:31,827 --> 01:05:34,523
Flavia, it's time for you to go home.

647
01:05:34,563 --> 01:05:36,656
My guards will escort you.

648
01:05:36,699 --> 01:05:39,668
- Free Marcus!
- Free Marcus! Free Marcus!

649
01:05:39,702 --> 01:05:42,671
Free Marcus! Free Marcus!

650
01:05:42,705 --> 01:05:45,640
Free Marcus!
Free Marcus!

651
01:05:51,714 --> 01:05:53,875
Ah. May I have
a private word with you?

652
01:05:53,916 --> 01:05:56,077
Flavia, you startled me.

653
01:05:56,118 --> 01:05:58,780
You are a sophisticated man
and your help is needed

654
01:05:58,821 --> 01:06:01,813
at the highest level on an extremely
confidential matter.

655
01:06:01,857 --> 01:06:03,722
This is strictly between us.

656
01:06:03,759 --> 01:06:05,659
Understand?

657
01:06:05,695 --> 01:06:07,424
You've come to the right man.

658
01:06:07,463 --> 01:06:09,931
Whatever it is you tell me,
I won't even think about it,

659
01:06:09,966 --> 01:06:11,900
let alone pass it on.

660
01:06:12,935 --> 01:06:15,870
By the way,
you've outdone yourself

661
01:06:15,905 --> 01:06:17,600
with the arrangements
for the games this year.

662
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:20,939
Thanks to you, the public
is singing Tiberius's praises,

663
01:06:20,977 --> 01:06:23,605
and I'll make sure
Falco tells him that.

664
01:06:23,646 --> 01:06:26,444
You are a woman
of many generosities, Flavia.

665
01:06:27,984 --> 01:06:31,010
You have a new very striking-Iooking
slave girl with long hair,

666
01:06:31,053 --> 01:06:33,851
- attending the gladiators.
- I know just the one you mean.

667
01:06:33,889 --> 01:06:36,949
- I selected her personally.
- I've come to borrow her.

668
01:06:36,993 --> 01:06:40,360
You are interested
in her services?

669
01:06:40,396 --> 01:06:43,229
Not personally, no.
Falco sent me.

670
01:06:43,265 --> 01:06:45,825
Ah. Falco.

671
01:06:45,868 --> 01:06:48,166
Tired of his new plaything
so soon, is he?

672
01:06:48,204 --> 01:06:50,866
- I am truly sorry.
- Don't be.

673
01:06:50,906 --> 01:06:53,101
- It's not what you think.
- You mean

674
01:06:53,142 --> 01:06:56,077
the dark-haired slave girl has
attracted the attention of...

675
01:06:56,112 --> 01:06:59,343
Shh! Don't even think about it.

676
01:07:01,317 --> 01:07:03,012
Oh ho.

677
01:07:08,190 --> 01:07:10,420
(cyclops roaring)

678
01:07:24,006 --> 01:07:26,236
Girl, where's Barbara?

679
01:07:28,477 --> 01:07:30,536
(cyclops roaring)

680
01:07:34,417 --> 01:07:36,112
Man:
Huh? Come on!

681
01:07:46,896 --> 01:07:48,659
Marcus: Hey!

682
01:07:51,934 --> 01:07:54,664
Are you gladiators
or cowardly savages?

683
01:07:55,704 --> 01:07:58,468
Torturing him when
he's powerless to defend himself?

684
01:07:58,507 --> 01:08:01,203
Feeding him worse
than your dog?

685
01:08:01,243 --> 01:08:03,643
- He's a cannibal.
- Because they're starving him...

686
01:08:03,679 --> 01:08:07,274
to sharpen his appetite
for your flesh in the arena.

687
01:08:09,085 --> 01:08:10,916
Girl, bring me the meat.

688
01:08:10,953 --> 01:08:13,080
The rest of you,
back to your quarters.

689
01:08:14,123 --> 01:08:16,114
(cyclops rumbling)

690
01:08:17,226 --> 01:08:19,251
(cyclops roars)

691
01:08:22,665 --> 01:08:24,360
You can go.

692
01:08:28,571 --> 01:08:30,801
Cyclops.

693
01:08:35,945 --> 01:08:37,606
"Meat."

694
01:08:47,890 --> 01:08:49,721
Cyclops:
Meeeat.

695
01:08:51,193 --> 01:08:53,161
Meeeat.

696
01:08:54,830 --> 01:08:57,196
- More?
- (grunts)

697
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,599
More meat?

698
01:09:45,514 --> 01:09:47,607
Where were you?

699
01:09:47,650 --> 01:09:51,450
I waited all night... like a fool.

700
01:09:51,487 --> 01:09:55,355
A person of rank sent for me.
I had no choice.

701
01:09:55,391 --> 01:09:57,359
Who? Falco?

702
01:09:57,393 --> 01:09:59,020
- He dies.
- No, not Falco.

703
01:09:59,061 --> 01:10:00,494
Flavia.

704
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,828
She wants to help.
She's on your side.

705
01:10:03,866 --> 01:10:07,427
Trust me,
Flavia is only out for Flavia.

706
01:10:07,469 --> 01:10:10,199
You underestimate her.

707
01:10:10,239 --> 01:10:12,400
She's using her position
to find out

708
01:10:12,441 --> 01:10:14,875
what Falco and Tiberius
are really up to.

709
01:10:14,910 --> 01:10:18,368
She's communicating
with you through me,

710
01:10:18,414 --> 01:10:21,076
because she dare not
talk to you directly.

711
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:24,348
Go on.

712
01:10:24,386 --> 01:10:26,946
Falco is pushing Tiberius

713
01:10:26,989 --> 01:10:29,651
to name him his successor.

714
01:10:29,692 --> 01:10:33,526
Tiberius feels threatened because
you are becoming too popular.

715
01:10:34,563 --> 01:10:37,157
The tide is turning against him.

716
01:10:37,199 --> 01:10:40,168
He fears a rebellion
to restore the Republic.

717
01:10:40,202 --> 01:10:42,602
He was always paranoid.

718
01:10:42,638 --> 01:10:45,539
He was threatened by my father
for the same reasons.

719
01:10:45,574 --> 01:10:49,943
Maybe. But Flavia says
the people admire you.

720
01:10:50,980 --> 01:10:53,710
You are the son
of the great politician.

721
01:10:53,749 --> 01:10:56,445
You're the one
who captured the cyclops.

722
01:10:56,485 --> 01:10:59,454
You're their hero in the arena.

723
01:10:59,488 --> 01:11:02,480
In an uprising they'd follow you.

724
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:04,583
You heard them.

725
01:11:04,627 --> 01:11:07,152
They want you free.

726
01:11:07,196 --> 01:11:10,097
And I'll fight for that freedom
every chance I get.

727
01:11:10,132 --> 01:11:12,066
Tomorrow, if you're lucky,

728
01:11:12,101 --> 01:11:14,262
you'll have a chance
to win that freedom.

729
01:11:14,303 --> 01:11:15,895
Yes!

730
01:11:15,938 --> 01:11:18,406
But the price is to kill
another gladiator

731
01:11:18,440 --> 01:11:21,034
or the cyclops.

732
01:11:21,076 --> 01:11:25,012
Flavia says Tiberius will never give
the cyclops a chance to be free.

733
01:11:26,348 --> 01:11:28,578
When the people tire of him,

734
01:11:28,617 --> 01:11:30,778
he'll be executed.

735
01:11:37,526 --> 01:11:40,586
How fickle is the applause
of the crowd, Falco.

736
01:11:40,629 --> 01:11:42,722
First Gordian was a hero,

737
01:11:42,765 --> 01:11:46,394
then suddenly Marcus is their favorite.
And shouting for his freedom?

738
01:11:46,435 --> 01:11:48,869
Who can explain it?

739
01:11:48,904 --> 01:11:51,429
It's circulating through
the marketplace

740
01:11:51,473 --> 01:11:54,374
that Marcus the gladiator
is the same centurion

741
01:11:54,410 --> 01:11:56,275
- that captured the cyclops.
- No no no.

742
01:11:56,312 --> 01:11:58,439
No no, you might
want that drink, Uncle.

743
01:11:58,480 --> 01:12:01,244
News from the front isn't good.

744
01:12:03,452 --> 01:12:05,113
Which front?

745
01:12:05,154 --> 01:12:07,088
- All of them.
- (groans)

746
01:12:09,124 --> 01:12:11,183
The legions fighting in Pannonia

747
01:12:11,226 --> 01:12:14,161
are demanding the same pay
as the praetorian guards here,

748
01:12:14,196 --> 01:12:16,164
and there's been
a camp mutiny in Germany.

749
01:12:16,198 --> 01:12:18,189
I suppose they want
more money too?

750
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,894
Worse.

751
01:12:19,935 --> 01:12:22,062
They've lost their faith in you.

752
01:12:22,104 --> 01:12:24,595
They think you're stretching
the troops too thin.

753
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:28,041
Decimate them. That'll show them
how thin I can stretch them.

754
01:12:28,077 --> 01:12:30,136
And you should know this:

755
01:12:30,179 --> 01:12:33,546
The Forum is buzzing
with hero-worship for Marcus.

756
01:12:33,582 --> 01:12:36,415
Who better than Marcus
to lead a coup against you?

757
01:12:36,452 --> 01:12:39,421
He'd have the people's support

758
01:12:39,455 --> 01:12:41,719
and half the army.

759
01:12:41,757 --> 01:12:43,315
Captain of the guard!

760
01:12:44,426 --> 01:12:46,792
Triple my protection
at the games tomorrow.

761
01:12:47,796 --> 01:12:49,957
Wait!

762
01:12:49,998 --> 01:12:52,125
What about Marcus?

763
01:12:52,167 --> 01:12:54,601
I'll take care of him.

764
01:12:56,672 --> 01:12:59,470
(grunts)

765
01:13:02,711 --> 01:13:04,679
Cyclops.

766
01:13:05,948 --> 01:13:09,281
- Meat.
- Meat.

767
01:13:09,318 --> 01:13:11,616
That's right.

768
01:13:14,823 --> 01:13:17,155
Meat.

769
01:13:18,761 --> 01:13:20,422
Meat.

770
01:13:21,563 --> 01:13:23,190
Cyclops?

771
01:13:23,232 --> 01:13:25,291
Tomorrow...

772
01:13:26,668 --> 01:13:28,966
I fight.

773
01:13:29,004 --> 01:13:31,666
If I win,

774
01:13:31,707 --> 01:13:34,471
me free.

775
01:13:35,644 --> 01:13:37,339
Meat.

776
01:13:42,885 --> 01:13:44,284
Fight!

777
01:13:45,587 --> 01:13:48,112
Kill!

778
01:13:50,058 --> 01:13:53,585
Win! Me free.

779
01:13:56,231 --> 01:13:58,358
- Meat.
- No.

780
01:13:58,400 --> 01:14:00,493
No meat.

781
01:14:00,536 --> 01:14:02,470
Free. Free!

782
01:14:02,504 --> 01:14:04,369
Meat!

783
01:14:16,552 --> 01:14:19,043
Cyclops.

784
01:14:33,268 --> 01:14:35,896
(coos)

785
01:14:40,375 --> 01:14:42,172
(growls)

786
01:14:44,012 --> 01:14:46,708
- Free.
- Free.

787
01:14:46,748 --> 01:14:48,409
- Free!
- No.

788
01:14:48,450 --> 01:14:51,146
Cyclops no free.

789
01:14:51,186 --> 01:14:52,983
Me free.

790
01:14:53,021 --> 01:14:55,512
Cyclops no free.

791
01:14:55,557 --> 01:15:00,051
Never free, no matter
how many men you kill.

792
01:15:00,095 --> 01:15:01,460
- (stomps) Free.
- No.

793
01:15:02,865 --> 01:15:04,924
Never.

794
01:15:06,068 --> 01:15:08,628
(cyclops grumbling)

795
01:15:20,282 --> 01:15:22,580
Citizens of Rome,

796
01:15:22,618 --> 01:15:24,984
the Emperor Tiberius...

797
01:15:26,355 --> 01:15:29,813
commander
of our invincible army,

798
01:15:29,858 --> 01:15:32,759
dedicates the final day
of the Victory Games

799
01:15:32,794 --> 01:15:36,286
- to you, the people.
- (crowd cheering)

800
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:39,391
You are noble Romans all,

801
01:15:39,434 --> 01:15:42,767
you who wish to reward courage
and victory in the arena

802
01:15:42,804 --> 01:15:45,329
with the great gift of liberty.

803
01:15:45,374 --> 01:15:48,036
You have spoken

804
01:15:48,076 --> 01:15:50,010
and your emperor has heard.

805
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:53,446
In tribute to your wish,

806
01:15:53,482 --> 01:15:57,043
three sets of gladiators
chosen by lot

807
01:15:57,085 --> 01:15:58,985
will fight to the death.

808
01:16:02,424 --> 01:16:06,451
The victors shall be
granted their freedom.

809
01:16:10,499 --> 01:16:14,333
Attilicus versus Pompeii.

810
01:16:14,369 --> 01:16:16,963
Place your bets on who will die...

811
01:16:17,005 --> 01:16:19,530
and who will win his freedom.

812
01:16:21,410 --> 01:16:25,005
Attilicus versus Pompeii.

813
01:16:25,047 --> 01:16:27,948
(cheering)

814
01:16:27,983 --> 01:16:30,850
Picking combatants by lot
makes no sense.

815
01:16:30,886 --> 01:16:32,615
Pompeii and Attilicus
are not well matched.

816
01:16:32,654 --> 01:16:34,121
This is going to be over
in just a minute.

817
01:16:34,156 --> 01:16:37,683
They should just pit the victors of the
last two days' games against each other.

818
01:16:37,726 --> 01:16:41,389
I'm sorry, Gordian.
I would just rather know

819
01:16:41,430 --> 01:16:44,126
that at least I'm going to have
a chance to win my freedom.

820
01:16:47,736 --> 01:16:49,567
Marcus, they have to let you fight.

821
01:16:51,607 --> 01:16:53,905
Flavia told me if they don't,
the public won't stand for it.

822
01:16:55,344 --> 01:16:57,676
(cheering)

823
01:17:03,385 --> 01:17:06,013
(chanting)
Kill kill kill kill!

824
01:17:06,054 --> 01:17:08,181
Kill kill
kill kill!

825
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:10,157
Kill kill kill kill!

826
01:17:14,529 --> 01:17:17,521
Attilicus, from this day forth,

827
01:17:17,566 --> 01:17:20,228
you are no longer a gladiator,
but a free man of Rome.

828
01:17:23,038 --> 01:17:26,201
The emperor presents you
with this wooden sword.

829
01:17:31,713 --> 01:17:33,271
(crowd cheering)

830
01:17:41,023 --> 01:17:44,015
And the next two gladiators are...

831
01:17:48,096 --> 01:17:50,860
Gordian

832
01:17:50,899 --> 01:17:54,460
- and...
- Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!

833
01:17:56,972 --> 01:17:58,462
Gordian versus...

834
01:17:58,507 --> 01:18:00,702
(silent)

835
01:18:02,144 --> 01:18:03,873
Gordian versus Goldoni

836
01:18:03,912 --> 01:18:06,107
the Sicilian.

837
01:18:06,148 --> 01:18:09,845
Keep Goldoni on the run
and tire him out.

838
01:18:09,885 --> 01:18:12,752
He's fast, but you're faster.

839
01:18:12,788 --> 01:18:14,949
Three times lucky they say.

840
01:18:14,990 --> 01:18:17,458
They're gonna call you
for the last match, I know it.

841
01:18:17,492 --> 01:18:20,052
Then we'll meet again
as free men.

842
01:19:58,593 --> 01:20:01,187
(cheering)

843
01:20:15,644 --> 01:20:18,204
Gordian shall be granted freedom!

844
01:20:32,227 --> 01:20:34,092
Citizens and free men...

845
01:20:36,865 --> 01:20:39,561
the last fight for noble death

846
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:42,468
or glorious liberty

847
01:20:42,504 --> 01:20:46,634
- shall be between...
- (crowd chanting) Marcus, Marcus!

848
01:20:46,675 --> 01:20:49,610
Marcus, Marcus,
Marcus!

849
01:20:49,644 --> 01:20:51,976
Marcus, Marcus, Marcus!

850
01:20:52,013 --> 01:20:54,777
Marcus it is, my friends.

851
01:20:59,187 --> 01:21:01,280
Call Marcus to the arena.

852
01:21:01,323 --> 01:21:03,086
Bring Marcus to the arena.

853
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:12,827
Marcus versus...

854
01:21:12,868 --> 01:21:14,768
the cyclops.

855
01:21:14,803 --> 01:21:18,102
Ringmaster:
Marcus versus the cyclops!

856
01:21:33,188 --> 01:21:35,179
Open the gate.

857
01:21:35,223 --> 01:21:37,487
What? Stop. No!

858
01:21:37,525 --> 01:21:40,494
- Stop the fight.
- Stop the fight, stop the fight!

859
01:21:40,528 --> 01:21:43,258
- Stop the fight, stop the fight!
- (booing)

860
01:21:53,441 --> 01:21:55,671
My fellow Romans,

861
01:21:55,710 --> 01:21:58,474
I share your outrage.

862
01:21:58,513 --> 01:22:00,538
Quintus Maximilius,

863
01:22:00,582 --> 01:22:04,484
I hold you responsible as manager
of these Victory Games.

864
01:22:05,887 --> 01:22:08,947
Are we barbarians

865
01:22:08,990 --> 01:22:11,959
that we take delight
in sheer slaughter?

866
01:22:13,028 --> 01:22:17,055
No, we want worthy opponents,
well matched.

867
01:22:17,098 --> 01:22:18,759
Without this,

868
01:22:18,800 --> 01:22:21,860
neither victory
nor death has meaning.

869
01:22:21,903 --> 01:22:25,134
The cyclops is
twice the size of any man.

870
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:28,574
Therefore I will not make
Marcus fight him alone.

871
01:22:28,610 --> 01:22:30,544
Bring me the casket.

872
01:22:30,578 --> 01:22:33,843
Another gladiator chosen by lot

873
01:22:33,882 --> 01:22:36,407
will fight alongside Marcus.

874
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:50,725
That's better.

875
01:23:01,376 --> 01:23:04,607
The final fight shall be

876
01:23:04,646 --> 01:23:07,877
the cyclops versus Marcus

877
01:23:07,916 --> 01:23:11,909
and the most ferocious,
the most savage,

878
01:23:11,953 --> 01:23:16,913
the most terrifying barbarian
ever captured alive!

879
01:23:16,958 --> 01:23:19,449
(all laughing)

880
01:23:22,797 --> 01:23:25,265
- Get it!
- Chosen by lot?

881
01:23:25,300 --> 01:23:28,531
What do they take us for? This whole
thing is rigged... it's obvious.

882
01:23:33,842 --> 01:23:35,901
Are we gonna
let them get away with this?

883
01:23:35,944 --> 01:23:38,139
- Open the gate!
- Stop the fight!

884
01:23:38,179 --> 01:23:40,579
Stop the fight! Stop the fight!

885
01:23:40,615 --> 01:23:42,446
Stop the fight!
Stop the fight!

886
01:23:42,484 --> 01:23:45,180
Stop the fight! Stop the fight!

887
01:23:45,220 --> 01:23:47,279
Stop the fight!
Stop the fight!

888
01:23:47,322 --> 01:23:49,222
Bring on the cyclops!

889
01:23:49,257 --> 01:23:51,953
(grunting and roaring)

890
01:23:56,464 --> 01:24:00,127
- Free Marcus!
- Free Marcus! Free Marcus!

891
01:24:00,168 --> 01:24:02,432
- Free Marcus! Free Marcus...
- Cyclops?

892
01:24:06,374 --> 01:24:08,638
Here here! Here!

893
01:24:39,207 --> 01:24:40,799
- Marcus!
- We've got to help them now.

894
01:24:40,842 --> 01:24:42,207
Are you with me?

895
01:24:46,081 --> 01:24:47,343
Now is the time.

896
01:25:09,504 --> 01:25:10,903
Open the gate!

897
01:25:12,574 --> 01:25:14,633
(sword clangs)

898
01:25:25,153 --> 01:25:27,417
Free!

899
01:25:28,423 --> 01:25:30,891
Free!

900
01:25:32,594 --> 01:25:36,155
Free free!

901
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:38,597
(roars)

902
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:41,431
Kill him and you're free.

903
01:25:43,905 --> 01:25:47,363
No! Cyclops, no free.

904
01:25:47,408 --> 01:25:50,206
(roars)
Free!

905
01:25:50,245 --> 01:25:53,373
- Kill him.
- Free!

906
01:25:54,949 --> 01:25:57,213
Cyclops, what are you waiting for?

907
01:25:58,419 --> 01:26:00,887
Never free!

908
01:26:03,558 --> 01:26:05,048
Kill him!

909
01:26:08,096 --> 01:26:10,690
(growls, grunting)

910
01:26:37,959 --> 01:26:40,086
Gordian, the axe!

911
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,939
Tiberius!

912
01:26:55,977 --> 01:26:58,946
Your tyranny is over.

913
01:27:17,465 --> 01:27:19,194
Handle this.
Handle this.

914
01:27:19,234 --> 01:27:20,724
Yes, Uncle.

915
01:27:20,768 --> 01:27:22,668
Flavia, go home.

916
01:27:24,038 --> 01:27:26,302
Guards, kill the cyclops.

917
01:27:26,341 --> 01:27:27,865
Kill him!

918
01:27:36,651 --> 01:27:40,087
You!
Call out the city cohort.

919
01:27:42,223 --> 01:27:44,691
Come with me! Come with me!

920
01:28:46,654 --> 01:28:48,417
Go!

921
01:29:09,344 --> 01:29:11,278
(whimpering)

922
01:29:12,747 --> 01:29:14,044
(bone cracks)

923
01:29:24,058 --> 01:29:28,324
Free! Free.

924
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:31,799
(roars) Free.

925
01:29:31,833 --> 01:29:34,233
Cyclops, look out!

926
01:29:50,485 --> 01:29:54,785
The beast is dead!

927
01:29:57,625 --> 01:29:59,684
No, the beast lives...

928
01:30:01,229 --> 01:30:02,594
but not for long.

929
01:30:06,100 --> 01:30:07,089
(gasping)

930
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:22,716
Barbara:
He's dead.

931
01:30:23,918 --> 01:30:26,284
Romans!

932
01:30:26,320 --> 01:30:28,185
We're free!

933
01:30:28,222 --> 01:30:30,782
(cheering)

934
01:30:35,329 --> 01:30:37,661
Long live the Republic!

935
01:30:37,698 --> 01:30:40,758
(chanting) Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

936
01:30:40,802 --> 01:30:44,238
Long live the Republic!
Long live the Republic!

937
01:30:44,272 --> 01:30:46,069
Long live the Republic...

938
01:30:50,611 --> 01:30:52,909
(cheering)

939
01:31:07,628 --> 01:31:09,892
(dramatic music playing)
