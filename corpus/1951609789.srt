Blue Jean Ball,
what a rip.

197
00:12:38,461 --> 00:12:40,053
Every other high school

198
00:12:40,096 --> 00:12:42,462
and we had
a Blue Jean Ball.

199
00:12:42,499 --> 00:12:44,228
How embarrassing.

200
00:12:44,267 --> 00:12:46,167
And Keith, home from college,
had to pick you up

201
00:12:46,203 --> 00:12:49,764
because you were too drunk
to drive home.

202
00:12:49,806 --> 00:12:51,637
And he died a year later.

203
00:12:51,675 --> 00:12:53,575
Now, he was the brother
you should have married.

204
00:12:53,610 --> 00:12:55,510
He was the special one.

205
00:12:55,545 --> 00:12:57,479

Goddamn it, Brad.

212

You promised.

until they drink a six-pack.

542
00:32:19,975 --> 00:32:22,773
So if l fix it, then what?

543
00:32:22,811 --> 00:32:25,678
We'll take it back to Overlook Ridge
and see if it works.

544
00:32:25,714 --> 00:32:27,511
lf it doesn't,
l'll just wait another 20 years

545
00:32:27,549 --> 00:32:29,278
to get back on the internet.

546
00:32:29,318 --> 00:32:31,752
But if your world
is the way you say it is,

547
00:32:31,787 --> 00:32:33,982
why would you want
to go back?

548
00:32:35,858 --> 00:32:38,156
lt's where l belong.

549
00:32:53,342 --> 00:32:57,745
(Mr. Thompson)
The French Revolution
began in 1 7 99.

550
00:32:57,780 --> 00:32:59,441
lt changed the course
of the country's history,

551
00:32:59,481 --> 00:33:01,779
<i>which still affects it today.</i>

552
00:33:03,118 --> 00:33:09,057
<i>Danton and Robespierre
dominated the new government,</i>

553
00:33:09,091 --> 00:33:11,184
<i>Robespierre gradually
gaining over Danton-</i>

554
00:33:11,226 --> 00:33:13,251
Um.

555
00:33:14,029 --> 00:33:15,519
Yes, Brad.

556
00:33:15,564 --> 00:33:17,532
l think
you're confusing the dates.

557
00:33:17,566 --> 00:33:20,262
You think so?

558
00:33:20,302 --> 00:33:21,394
Actually, l know so.

559
00:33:21,437 --> 00:33:23,564
You're confusing it
with the fall of Robespierre.

560
00:33:23,605 --> 00:33:26,836
<i>The Revolution itself
began in 1 7 93.</i>

561
00:33:26,875 --> 00:33:28,206
<i>At least,
that was the beginning</i>

562
00:33:28,243 --> 00:33:29,369
of the flight of the emigres

563
00:33:29,411 --> 00:33:31,242
and the resurrection
of the lampposts.

564
00:33:32,981 --> 00:33:34,005
You know, Mr. Jenkins,

565
00:33:34,049 --> 00:33:36,574
l haven't always been
just a high school teacher.

566
00:33:36,618 --> 00:33:38,643
l was a professor
before l came here,

567
00:33:38,687 --> 00:33:39,915
and do you know where?

568
00:33:39,955 --> 00:33:41,718
<i>Gilligan's Island?</i>

569
00:33:41,757 --> 00:33:43,816
You have an attitude problem,
young man.

570
00:33:43,859 --> 00:33:45,520
Now, l'm going to have
to call your parents.

571
00:33:45,561 --> 00:33:46,653
You know that, don't you?

572
00:33:46,695 --> 00:33:48,492
Yes, sir.

573
00:33:48,530 --> 00:33:50,225
Good, then.

574
00:33:50,265 --> 00:33:51,892
That's what l want to hear.

575
00:33:51,934 --> 00:33:53,629
<i>Now, what you need
is some more school spirit</i>

576
00:33:53,669 --> 00:33:55,694
and some more class involvement.

577
00:33:55,737 --> 00:33:58,205
<i>I noticed you didn't sign up
to take anybody to the Blue Jean Ball.</i>

578
00:33:58,240 --> 00:34:01,869
Now, l am sure there is some young man
just waiting to ask you,

579
00:34:01,910 --> 00:34:05,437
<i>or you ask him.</i>

580
00:34:11,954 --> 00:34:15,754
<i>Roland,
how's our all-American, huh?</i>

581
00:34:15,791 --> 00:34:17,019
Hi.

582
00:34:18,460 --> 00:34:20,018
Hi, Roland.

583
00:34:20,062 --> 00:34:23,554
<i>(Fock)
Now, about
that basketball scholarship.</i>

584
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,227
<i>I think you should consider
all three. . .</i>

585
00:34:26,268 --> 00:34:28,896
Brad, can you show our
new transfer student to room 24?

586
00:34:28,937 --> 00:34:30,461
<i>This is-
Juliel</i>

587
00:34:36,712 --> 00:34:38,873
You know my name.

588
00:34:38,914 --> 00:34:41,508
You are correct, sir.

589
00:34:41,550 --> 00:34:43,677
So what's this school like?

590
00:34:43,719 --> 00:34:45,846
Oh, a waste of time.

591
00:34:45,888 --> 00:34:48,152
God, l can't get over
how young you look.

592
00:34:48,190 --> 00:34:50,818
l am a senior.

593
00:34:50,859 --> 00:34:52,918
So what are the girls like?

594
00:34:52,961 --> 00:34:54,485
l don't know.

595
00:34:54,530 --> 00:34:56,293
l guess not;
you're a guy.

596
00:34:56,331 --> 00:34:59,698
Oh, here it is,
room 422.

597
00:34:59,735 --> 00:35:02,101
So-
Thanks for the tour.

598
00:35:18,187 --> 00:35:19,347
You should have
seen the look

599
00:35:19,388 --> 00:35:21,515
on Mr. Thompson's face
when you took him down.

600
00:35:21,557 --> 00:35:23,650
Yeah, real mature
on my part.

601
00:35:26,028 --> 00:35:27,120
Hi, Brad.

602
00:35:27,162 --> 00:35:29,221
Hi, Roland.

603
00:35:29,264 --> 00:35:31,289
Hope you didn't
get in trouble

604
00:35:31,333 --> 00:35:32,857
with Mr. Fock.

605
00:35:32,901 --> 00:35:34,459
Nah, great guy.

606
00:35:34,503 --> 00:35:37,563
[all laugh]

607
00:35:37,606 --> 00:35:38,868
See ya.

608
00:35:43,779 --> 00:35:45,110
Look at you.

609
00:35:45,147 --> 00:35:47,581
You've got the best-looking guy
talking to you,

610
00:35:47,616 --> 00:35:49,379
and you're smart.

611
00:35:57,125 --> 00:35:58,717
<i>Fuck you, breeder.</i>

612
00:36:03,232 --> 00:36:04,961
That's Dwayne Twillis.

613
00:36:05,000 --> 00:36:06,592
Fucking hole puncher.

614
00:36:06,635 --> 00:36:07,624
What?

615
00:36:07,669 --> 00:36:10,729
You know, a breeder,
straight.

616
00:36:10,772 --> 00:36:14,208
He likes girls so much,
he even acts like one.

617
00:36:14,243 --> 00:36:16,507
God, it makes me sick.

618
00:36:19,481 --> 00:36:22,245
This Janis lan album
is the coolest.

619
00:36:22,284 --> 00:36:24,081
That is so straight.

620
00:36:35,397 --> 00:36:37,627
<i>(Brad)
You dropped your milk.</i>

621
00:36:42,304 --> 00:36:43,635
<i>Listen, I just-</i>

622
00:36:53,615 --> 00:36:55,446
Busted.

623
00:36:57,386 --> 00:36:59,217
<i>(Bob)
Brad, is that you?</i>

624
00:36:59,254 --> 00:37:01,381
You're home.

625
00:37:01,423 --> 00:37:02,685
l'm at Mom's tonight?

626
00:37:02,724 --> 00:37:03,713
l'm going right now.

627
00:37:03,759 --> 00:37:06,250
No, you've got company.

628
00:37:06,295 --> 00:37:08,388
Roland came by
to see you.

629
00:37:09,531 --> 00:37:11,624
Roland's been telling us
about his plans

630
00:37:11,667 --> 00:37:13,157
<i>to play for the NB A.</i>

631
00:37:13,201 --> 00:37:14,930
l was just wondering

632
00:37:14,970 --> 00:37:17,370
if you'd like to go out with me
for some ice cream.

633
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:19,498
Go on.

634
00:37:19,541 --> 00:37:21,975
We're at your Mom's tonight-
every goddamned night-

635
00:37:22,010 --> 00:37:25,036
playing Scrabble.

636
00:37:25,080 --> 00:37:26,547
Okay.

637
00:37:35,223 --> 00:37:36,690
Can l change
real quick?

638
00:37:36,725 --> 00:37:38,158
Sure.

639
00:37:53,008 --> 00:37:54,669
<i>(Brad)
He was all alone.</i>

640
00:37:54,710 --> 00:37:57,406
<i>He was just sitting
at the end of the bar.</i>

641
00:37:57,446 --> 00:38:01,075
<i>God, I was so nervous
being in that place.</i>

642
00:38:01,116 --> 00:38:04,210
Something made me go up
and talk to him.

643
00:38:04,252 --> 00:38:06,720
l just went up and asked
if l could sit at his table.

644
00:38:07,989 --> 00:38:10,958
He stood up
just like the perfect gentleman.

645
00:38:10,992 --> 00:38:12,983
He was 34.

646
00:38:13,028 --> 00:38:14,017
34?

647
00:38:14,062 --> 00:38:15,689
Yeah, divorced
with two kids.

648
00:38:15,731 --> 00:38:17,392
<i>Jeez.</i>

649
00:38:17,432 --> 00:38:19,627
Well, we decided to try it.

650
00:38:19,668 --> 00:38:20,657
l don't know;

651
00:38:20,702 --> 00:38:25,435
l thought it was my last chance
to finally have a family.

652
00:38:25,474 --> 00:38:28,272
lt didn't end very well.

653
00:38:28,310 --> 00:38:31,404
lt was too much for him.
lt was too much for me.

654
00:38:31,446 --> 00:38:32,845
The moral of the story is,

655
00:38:32,881 --> 00:38:36,510
don't get in a one-night stand
that ends up lasting two years.

656
00:38:38,920 --> 00:38:41,411
l like you.

657
00:38:41,456 --> 00:38:43,788

l'm having fun here.

670
00:39:31,973 --> 00:39:34,806
Why do you want
to take that away from me?

671
00:39:34,843 --> 00:39:37,243
lt wasn't my decision.

672
00:39:43,785 --> 00:39:45,480

Nothing.

Uh, we're test-driving a car.

<i>You asking me out

You were terrific.

953
00:58:52,633 --> 00:58:53,691
Let's do it again.

Hide and sneak
every time we want to meet?

966
00:59:22,696 --> 00:59:24,721
We can't go anywhere
or do anything

967
00:59:24,765 --> 00:59:27,199
without somebody seeing us.
