186
00:10:24,324 --> 00:10:25,392
I'll be here.

00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,159
OFFICER (ON PHONE):
Merry Christmas.

188
00:10:26,259 --> 00:10:26,694
Please wait.

189
00:10:26,794 --> 00:10:27,560
Wait, wait.

193
00:10:33,166 --> 00:10:34,835
Please.

194
00:10:34,935 --> 00:10:36,603
Wait, wait.
Amy!

195
00:10:36,704 --> 00:10:37,771
Amy, wait.

196
00:10:37,871 --> 00:10:39,206
I'll call and cancel.
Yeah, yeah.

197
00:10:39,306 --> 00:10:41,408
--the time you're ready
to join us, all right, Fred.

198
00:10:41,508 --> 00:10:43,677
Yeah, fine, but
you've got the car!

199
00:10:43,777 --> 00:10:47,815
I can't-- I can't join
you with you in the car.

200
00:10:47,915 --> 00:10:48,916
You come back here!

201
00:10:52,853 --> 00:10:56,056
Was I the only one
that heard that noise?

202
00:10:56,156 --> 00:10:58,692
Was I the only

212
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,524
Are you sure about
these alleged noises?

213
00:11:31,624 --> 00:11:33,160
Yes, I'm sure.

214
00:11:33,260 --> 00:11:34,094
All right, Mr. Johnson.

215
00:11:34,194 --> 00:11:35,028
Let's take a look.

216
00:11:38,198 --> 00:11:39,299
This is Unit 69.

217
00:11:39,399 --> 00:11:40,533
I'm checking the premises.

218
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,035
MAN (ON RADIO): [inaudible].
Thank you.

219
00:11:42,135 --> 00:11:43,003
69 out.

220
00:11:46,573 --> 00:11:47,775
All right, Mr. Johnson.
You wait here.

221
00:11:47,875 --> 00:11:49,276
I'm going to see
if anyone's home.

222
00:11:49,376 --> 00:11:50,177
Fine.
Good.

223
00:11:59,586 --> 00:12:01,088

00:12:05,158 --> 00:12:06,426
[knocks]

225
00:12:09,262 --> 00:12:11,064
There's no answer.
I'm going to go around.

226
00:12:17,370 --> 00:12:19,539
Well, there's no reason to
look any further, Mr. Johnson.

227
00:12:19,639 --> 00:12:21,741
Dr. Memo left a memo
for the postman.

228
00:12:21,842 --> 00:12:23,811
Your neighbor's away
for the holidays.

229
00:12:23,911 --> 00:12:25,478
Well, how do we know
this is Memo's memo?

230
00:12:25,578 --> 00:12:26,446
Maybe this isn't Memo's memo.

231
00:12:26,546 --> 00:12:27,714
Possibly.

232
00:12:27,815 --> 00:12:30,818
But I didn't see any
sign of a break in.

233
00:12:30,918 --> 00:12:32,052
Can you just sign here, please?

234
00:12:32,152 --> 00:12:33,420
Well, what about the noises?

235
00:12:33,520 --> 00:12:36,056
Well, maybe Dr. Memo left
his TV on or something.

236
00:12:36,156 --> 00:12:38,525
Well, can't you
search the place?

237
00:12:38,625 --> 00:12:39,726
I'd need a search
warrant for that.

238
00:12:39,827 --> 00:12:41,061
Can't you get a warrant?

239
00:12:41,161 --> 00:12:42,362
No, you're the only witness.

240
00:12:42,462 --> 00:12:44,264
I see no evidence of
the noises you describe,

241
00:12:44,364 --> 00:12:46,967
there's no sign of a break
in, and there's a note.

242
00:12:47,067 --> 00:12:48,235
But if you have
any more problems,

243
00:12:48,335 --> 00:12:49,769
please feel free to
call and ask for me.

244
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:51,471
I'm Lieutenant Butch.

245
00:12:51,571 --> 00:12:52,806
Merry Christmas.

246
00:12:57,277 --> 00:12:58,778

Hello?

251
00:13:22,602 --> 00:13:24,171
Anybody home?

252
00:13:24,271 --> 00:13:25,705
That's what I thought.
Nobody's here.

253
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,040
OK.
Thank you.

254
00:13:27,140 --> 00:13:28,341
Do you know this guy?

255
00:13:28,441 --> 00:13:29,576
Are you should have
permission to be here?

256
00:13:29,676 --> 00:13:30,477
It's OK.
It's all right.

257
00:13:30,577 --> 00:13:31,378
Do you want to receipt?

258
00:13:31,478 --> 00:13:32,312
No, forget about it.

259
00:13:32,412 --> 00:13:33,113
Here's my card.

260
00:13:33,213 --> 00:13:34,681
We're open 24 hours all day.

261
00:13:34,781 --> 00:13:35,615
Thank you.

262
00:13:35,715 --> 00:13:36,516
Merry Christmas.

263
00:13:36,616 --> 00:13:37,484
Yeah, Merry Christmas.

264
00:13:37,584 --> 00:13:38,651
Get off my foot.

I'm your neighbor.

in, see, so I came over and--

291
00:16:37,664 --> 00:16:40,800
The question then becomes,
what happened to it?

292
00:16:40,900 --> 00:16:42,202
I was just going to ask--

293
00:16:42,302 --> 00:16:45,638
Well, that, Mr. Johnson,
is where I've discovered

294
00:16:45,738 --> 00:16:50,910
the vortex crossings not
in six, not in seven,

295
00:16:51,010 --> 00:16:56,049
not in eight dimensions, Mr.
Johnson, but twelve dimensions.

296
00:16:56,149 --> 00:16:57,184
A gateway.

297
00:16:57,284 --> 00:17:00,019
A kind of white
hole, if you will.

298
00:17:00,120 --> 00:17:02,555
But created here, on Earth!

299
00:17:02,655 --> 00:17:03,823
Do you follow me?

300
00:17:03,923 --> 00:17:04,757
Should I be?

301
00:17:04,857 --> 00:17:05,892
MEMO: Yes.

302
00:17:05,992 --> 00:17:07,660
Because until
recently, those who

303
00:17:07,760 --> 00:17:11,331
laughed at the idea of
travel at the speed of sound,

304
00:17:11,431 --> 00:17:15,168
they still tell us instantaneous
transportation will

305
00:17:15,268 --> 00:17:17,036
forever be beyond man's grasp.

306
00:17:17,137 --> 00:17:19,272
And again they are wrong!

307
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:22,642
Mind over matter, Mr. Johnson.

308
00:17:22,742 --> 00:17:23,843
Yeah.

309
00:17:23,943 --> 00:17:25,912
If you don't mind,
it doesn't matter.

310
00:17:26,012 --> 00:17:28,081
Now, the way to
achieve such speeds

311
00:17:28,181 --> 00:17:30,917
is through the instantaneous
transportation of matter

312
00:17:31,017 --> 00:17:33,019
from one coordinate to another.

313
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,288

one and refrigerator two.

00:17:38,725 --> 00:17:45,098
Any item or person that
I put in refrigerator one

316
00:17:45,198 --> 00:17:49,035
will be instantaneously
transported

317
00:17:49,136 --> 00:17:50,937
to refrigerator two.

00:17:54,174 --> 00:17:56,576

322
00:17:57,677 --> 00:18:00,313
I, uh-- Don't do
anything on my account.

323
00:18:03,816 --> 00:18:10,056
Mr Johnson, will you please
check the left refrigerator.

324
00:18:10,157 --> 00:18:10,957
What?

325
00:18:11,057 --> 00:18:12,091
Open the door.

326
00:18:16,929 --> 00:18:18,765
OK, it's empty.

327
00:18:18,865 --> 00:18:21,968
If you will please check
the right refrigerator.

328
00:18:22,068 --> 00:18:22,869
Phew.

329
00:18:26,373 --> 00:18:27,940
Yeah.
MEMO: What?

330
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:28,875
Nothing in it.

331
00:18:28,975 --> 00:18:30,210
That's not possible.

332
00:18:30,310 --> 00:18:31,811
Yeah, well, it's going
to take a hell of a lot

333
00:18:31,911 --> 00:18:34,080
more than this to convince me.

00:19:06,513 --> 00:19:08,248
They'll confiscate
the teleport chambers.

341
00:19:08,348 --> 00:19:09,616
Make an independent
investigation.

342
00:19:09,716 --> 00:19:11,284
I'm depending on
their investigation.

343
00:19:11,384 --> 00:19:14,053
Yeah, but I might be
diagnosed as mentally unstable.

344
00:19:14,153 --> 00:19:17,089
You are mentally unstable.

354
00:19:49,456 --> 00:19:50,122
Put that down.

356
00:19:52,124 --> 00:19:53,926
Now.

358
00:19:59,165 --> 00:20:00,467
I don't understand.

00:20:00,567 --> 00:20:02,602
The glass was suppose
to wind up over here.

360
00:20:02,702 --> 00:20:04,103
See, it's a
teleportation chamber.

361
00:20:04,203 --> 00:20:05,004
Ask the professor.

362
00:20:05,104 --> 00:20:07,006
I know nothing.

363
00:20:07,106 --> 00:20:08,641
That's because
it's his machine.

364
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,743
See, he's a nemo, and
that's short for nuts.

365

His family has been blowing
people up for centuries.

And these Nazis
never broke in?

368
00:20:15,682 --> 00:20:16,316
No, no, no.

369
00:20:16,416 --> 00:20:17,650
They broke out!

370
00:20:17,750 --> 00:20:19,319
Well, there's no laws
against breaking out.

371
00:20:19,419 --> 00:20:21,120
There are only laws
against breaking in.

372
00:20:21,220 --> 00:20:22,889
Did these Nazis take anything?

373
00:20:22,989 --> 00:20:23,823
No, but they could have.

374
00:20:23,923 --> 00:20:25,392
Good point.

375
00:20:25,492 --> 00:20:27,159
All right, gentlemen, I
have your statements here.

376
00:20:27,260 --> 00:20:28,995
I'll take your depositions
under advisement.

377
00:20:29,095 --> 00:20:31,264
And feel free to call me if
these thugs make themselves

378
00:20:31,364 --> 00:20:32,899
available for arrest.

379
00:20:32,999 --> 00:20:36,002
Again, Merry Christmas.

380
00:20:36,102 --> 00:20:37,904
Make themselves
available for arrest?

381
00:20:42,309 --> 00:20:45,111
Make themselves
available for arrest?

382
00:20:45,211 --> 00:20:48,147
Is that what I pay taxes for?

383
00:20:48,247 --> 00:20:50,116
Is that what I pay taxes for?

384
00:20:50,216 --> 00:20:52,285
You know who are the
Nazis in that situation?

385
00:20:52,385 --> 00:20:54,053
It's not them, it's you.

386
00:20:54,153 --> 00:20:55,087
You're the Nazi.

387
00:20:55,187 --> 00:20:55,988
You're the Nazi.

388
00:20:59,225 --> 00:21:00,560
I've got your badge number!

389
00:21:03,296 --> 00:21:04,163
As I was saying--

390
00:21:04,263 --> 00:21:05,732
I'm not talking to you.

391
00:21:05,832 --> 00:21:07,334
You have no choice.

392
00:21:07,434 --> 00:21:10,770
This matter requires
some heavy research.

393
00:21:10,870 --> 00:21:11,704
Heavy what?

394
00:21:15,742 --> 00:21:17,644

[rifles cocking]

403
00:21:51,444 --> 00:21:52,745
Well, one thing's certain.

404
00:21:52,845 --> 00:21:54,514
The research is
heavy, all right.

405
00:21:54,614 --> 00:21:55,915
Man, I'm dead tired.

406
00:21:56,015 --> 00:21:57,717
I haven't pulled all-nighters
like this since--

407
00:21:57,817 --> 00:21:58,451
MEMO: That's it!

408
00:21:58,551 --> 00:21:59,952
German war experiments.

409
00:22:00,052 --> 00:22:01,220
Yeah, V1, V2 rocket.

410
00:22:01,320 --> 00:22:02,154
So?

411
00:22:02,254 --> 00:22:03,222
Not here.

412
00:22:03,322 --> 00:22:05,958
There.

413
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,429
They're German-- in 1942--

414
00:22:09,529 --> 00:22:11,531
Would you please pay attention.

415
00:22:11,631 --> 00:22:14,367
It says here, during World
War II a major project was put

416
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:16,569
forward in Germany to
transport troops to Britain

417
00:22:16,669 --> 00:22:18,671
without relying on the
use of air and sea power.

418
00:22:18,771 --> 00:22:22,742
The designer was an
engineer name Muck.

419
00:22:22,842 --> 00:22:24,010
Muck

420
00:22:24,110 --> 00:22:26,746
Yes, Muck, consultant to
the Messerschmitt Company,

421
00:22:26,846 --> 00:22:29,616
who proposed a solenoid chamber
to be mounted in a hillside

422
00:22:29,716 --> 00:22:32,118
near Liel Coldfield in France.

423
00:22:32,218 --> 00:22:33,453
This teleport
chamber would then be

424
00:22:33,553 --> 00:22:35,755
used to send
squadrons of Germans

425
00:22:35,855 --> 00:22:39,592
into London from a
range of 155 miles?

426
00:22:39,692 --> 00:22:41,060
That's inconceivable!

427
00:22:41,160 --> 00:22:43,229
I never knew the Germans
did research like that.

428
00:22:43,329 --> 00:22:45,565
Neither did I.
Nobody did, obviously,

429
00:22:45,665 --> 00:22:46,833
or we would have heard about it.

430
00:22:46,933 --> 00:22:48,635
Hm.

431
00:22:48,735 --> 00:22:49,702
This is--

432
00:22:49,802 --> 00:22:51,237
I'm surprised they even tried.

433
00:22:51,337 --> 00:22:54,507
I mean, the technology was
clearly not available to them.

434
00:22:54,607 --> 00:22:55,742
And what about Muck?

435
00:22:55,842 --> 00:22:56,676
MEMO: Muck.

436
00:22:56,776 --> 00:22:57,910
Muck.

437
00:22:58,010 --> 00:23:00,179
Um-- nothing.

438
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,714
It doesn't say.
- Oh.

439
00:23:01,814 --> 00:23:03,115
He must have been
sacked by Hitler

440
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,350
and sent off to
the Eastern Front.

441
00:23:04,451 --> 00:23:05,351
Really?

442
00:23:05,452 --> 00:23:07,787
What else does it say here?

443
00:23:07,887 --> 00:23:08,688
Yes.

444
00:23:11,023 --> 00:23:14,060
Any remains of the research
facility in the chamber

445
00:23:14,160 --> 00:23:19,065
were destroyed during an
ally bombing raid in 1944.

446
00:23:19,165 --> 00:23:21,901
The idea has never been revived.

447
00:23:22,001 --> 00:23:24,637
But this still
doesn't explain what

448
00:23:24,737 --> 00:23:27,540
there were Nazis doing running
around your living room.

449
00:23:27,640 --> 00:23:29,976
Mr. Johnson, the
answer is plain as day.

450
00:23:30,076 --> 00:23:32,645
My vortex must have
accidentally tapped

451
00:23:32,745 --> 00:23:35,181
into some experiments
in teleportation which

452
00:23:35,281 --> 00:23:37,684
the Germans were doing in 1942.

453
00:23:37,784 --> 00:23:39,719
Their chamber interfered
with my chamber,

454
00:23:39,819 --> 00:23:43,222
when in fact, they should have
been sent to Britain in 1942.

455
00:23:43,322 --> 00:23:44,624
That's quite a jump.

456
00:23:44,724 --> 00:23:47,426
Yes, I admit it's not
usual, but time and space

457
00:23:47,527 --> 00:23:49,195
are essentially the same thing.
Everyone knows that.

458
00:23:49,295 --> 00:23:52,565
If you can travel in one,
you can travel in the other.

459
00:23:52,665 --> 00:23:55,568
So you-- so they--

460
00:23:55,668 --> 00:23:59,672
and then-- So what do we do now?

461
00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:02,742
Oh, if I only
knew, Mr. Johnson.

462
00:24:02,842 --> 00:24:04,043
Well, OK.

463
00:24:04,143 --> 00:24:05,377
I'll see you when I get back.

464
00:24:05,478 --> 00:24:06,278
Back?

465
00:24:06,378 --> 00:24:07,514
Back from where?

466
00:24:07,614 --> 00:24:09,081
I've got to go
get some sleep, OK?

467
00:24:09,181 --> 00:24:10,149
Tonight's Christmas Eve.

468
00:24:10,249 --> 00:24:11,117
I've got to go find my wife.

469
00:24:11,217 --> 00:24:12,485
Are we insane?

470
00:24:12,585 --> 00:24:14,687
These are German
military troops.

471
00:24:14,787 --> 00:24:16,455
Relics from the
Second World War.

472
00:24:16,556 --> 00:24:17,890
Remnants from history.

473
00:24:17,990 --> 00:24:19,125
Do you realize--

474
00:24:19,225 --> 00:24:20,159
Count yourself lucky.

475
00:24:20,259 --> 00:24:22,995
At least they're not burglars.

476
00:24:23,095 --> 00:24:24,363
Excuse me.

Are you sure he'll be here?

492
00:25:32,899 --> 00:25:34,466
Mom, give me some credit, OK?

493
00:25:34,567 --> 00:25:35,602
Tomorrow is Christmas.

00:25:35,702 --> 00:25:36,636
Fred wouldn't want to miss it.

495
00:25:36,736 --> 00:25:38,204
He'll be here.

[sighs]

497
00:25:39,338 --> 00:25:40,239
We should have waited for him.

No!

499
00:25:41,340 --> 00:25:43,209
This time he went overboard.

500
00:25:43,309 --> 00:25:44,143
Way overboard.

The German heavy artillery
were getting hot from firing

506
00:26:12,805 --> 00:26:14,841
Hitler says to the
Germans, "Churchill

507
00:26:14,941 --> 00:26:17,243
believes he can
resist, but I tell you

508
00:26:17,343 --> 00:26:18,878
that England will be crushed."

509
00:26:18,978 --> 00:26:20,847
What do you want me to say?

510
00:26:20,947 --> 00:26:21,881
How do you expect me to react?

511
00:26:21,981 --> 00:26:24,183
That's just plain ridiculous.

512
00:26:24,283 --> 00:26:25,718
I know it sounds ridiculous.

513
00:26:25,818 --> 00:26:27,687
That's because it is ridiculous.

514
00:26:27,787 --> 00:26:29,455
You see, they were
conducting these experiments

515
00:26:29,555 --> 00:26:31,023

Christmas with your family.

in the car and come here now!

Yeah, I can--

522
00:26:39,799 --> 00:26:41,233
I can leave right away.

don't care what it takes, Ben!

me just a second, please?

Inshallah.

530
00:27:00,687 --> 00:27:01,921
But we keep the
meter running, yes?

531
00:27:02,021 --> 00:27:02,822
Yeah, fine.

532
00:27:02,922 --> 00:27:03,756

Dr. Memo, I'm getting ready
to join my wife and my family,

536
00:27:23,109 --> 00:27:26,178
and I just kind of wanted to
stop by and wish you a merry--

537
00:27:26,278 --> 00:27:27,546
Run, Mr. Johnson!

We are going to airport, sir?

541
00:27:42,461 --> 00:27:45,131
No, just go, drive!

542
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:45,898
Who are these people?

543
00:27:45,998 --> 00:27:47,166
They're gonna kill us.

544
00:27:47,266 --> 00:27:48,100
Go!

00:27:48,200 --> 00:27:49,001

00:28:20,432 --> 00:28:21,567
Mr. Johnson, why did you run?

551
00:28:21,667 --> 00:28:23,535
You could have been killed!

552
00:28:23,635 --> 00:28:25,637
Didn't you say
"run, Mr. Johnson?"

553
00:28:25,738 --> 00:28:27,439
That was just a
figure of speech.

554
00:28:27,539 --> 00:28:28,875
Your efforts were futile!

555
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,376
God, we're prisoners now.

556
00:28:30,476 --> 00:28:32,478
We're war prisoners!

557
00:28:32,578 --> 00:28:33,980
Could be worse.

558
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:34,814
Worse?

559
00:28:34,914 --> 00:28:36,315
Professor, I don't want to die!

560
00:28:36,415 --> 00:28:37,483
Tut-tut-tut!

561
00:28:37,583 --> 00:28:39,485
Let us keep matters
in perspective!

562
00:28:39,585 --> 00:28:43,489
Historically speaking,
they may torture, mutilate,

563
00:28:43,589 --> 00:28:48,260
vandalize, lobotomize,
or sodomize you,

564
00:28:48,360 --> 00:28:50,162
but they won't kill you.

565
00:28:50,262 --> 00:28:52,331
They need you.

566
00:28:52,431 --> 00:28:53,265
Need me for what?

567
00:28:53,365 --> 00:28:54,166
I'm--

568
00:28:54,266 --> 00:28:55,501
[dogs barking]

569
00:28:55,601 --> 00:28:58,337
[speaking german]

570
00:28:58,437 --> 00:29:00,172
Oh, God, they're coming for us.

571
00:29:00,272 --> 00:29:01,240
Shh, shh.

572
00:29:01,340 --> 00:29:02,174
Be calm!

573
00:29:02,274 --> 00:29:03,776
Nazis are not the
robots that are

574
00:29:03,876 --> 00:29:05,744
commonly portrayed in movies. .

575
00:29:05,845 --> 00:29:08,247
[speaking german]

576
00:29:32,872 --> 00:29:34,773
[speaking german]

577
00:29:45,284 --> 00:29:47,286
Alex Memo?

578
00:29:47,386 --> 00:29:50,389
Dr. Alex Memo.

579
00:29:50,489 --> 00:29:59,398
And Lopez, Eddie Lopez
III, open 24 hours a day.

580
00:29:59,498 --> 00:30:00,432
[speaking german]

581
00:30:02,034 --> 00:30:05,071
What does it mean,
"24 hours a day?"

582
00:30:05,171 --> 00:30:08,074
It means-- it really
means I'm open at 12:00

583
00:30:08,174 --> 00:30:15,714
Dr. Memo, Mr. Lopez, I
am Friedrich von Kontz.

584
00:30:15,814 --> 00:30:17,917
I am in command of this force.

585
00:30:18,017 --> 00:30:21,120
I'm very impressed by
the progress technology

586
00:30:21,220 --> 00:30:24,823
has made in only 50 years.

587
00:30:24,924 --> 00:30:26,158
I know where we are.

588
00:30:26,258 --> 00:30:32,598
We left Germany in 1942,
exactly 50 years ago.

589
00:30:32,698 --> 00:30:34,233
A miracle of science.

590
00:30:34,333 --> 00:30:38,104
Due to some unforeseen
accident, I am sure.

591
00:30:38,204 --> 00:30:42,408
Neither you nor Mr. Lopez seem
to have planned any of this.

592
00:30:42,508 --> 00:30:45,912
The obvious solution to this
problem is quite simple.

593
00:30:46,012 --> 00:30:49,015
We have arrived
at this location.

594
00:30:49,115 --> 00:30:50,716
Now we want to go back.

595
00:30:50,816 --> 00:30:53,252
That can't be done.

596
00:30:53,352 --> 00:30:55,721
It implies traveled
back through time,

597
00:30:55,821 --> 00:30:57,957
a theoretical impossibility!

598
00:31:05,631 --> 00:31:07,099
Have you tried it?

599
00:31:07,199 --> 00:31:10,036
Commander von Kontz, might
you be considering this matter

600
00:31:10,136 --> 00:31:12,238
from a one-sided perspective?

601
00:31:12,338 --> 00:31:14,140
Closer examination
will reveal this

602
00:31:14,240 --> 00:31:19,311
to be a very pleasant
location, a civilized world!

603
00:31:19,411 --> 00:31:20,746
The war is over.

604
00:31:20,846 --> 00:31:25,417
You may all retire to civilian
life, live in Los Angeles,

605
00:31:25,517 --> 00:31:27,419
enjoy the mild weather!

606
00:31:27,519 --> 00:31:30,957
And of course, no trials
for, you know, war atrocities.

607
00:31:31,057 --> 00:31:32,491
War trials?

608
00:31:32,591 --> 00:31:35,894
Uh, war crime trials.

609
00:31:35,995 --> 00:31:37,663
Allied war trials.

610
00:31:45,637 --> 00:31:47,906
Very well, Mr. Lopez.

611
00:31:48,007 --> 00:31:50,709
Since Dr. Memo is
not cooperating,

612
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:52,378
we are going to shoot you.

613
00:31:52,478 --> 00:31:55,014
Look, Herr Ober whatever
you are, your name

614
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,183
is, you're not gonna
get away with this.

615
00:31:57,283 --> 00:31:58,784
The police are on to you.

616
00:31:58,884 --> 00:32:00,519
And if you think you're tough,
wait till you see what happens

617
00:32:00,619 --> 00:32:02,654
when the cops get pissed.
Right, Professor?

618
00:32:02,754 --> 00:32:04,390
Tell 'em about Rodney King!

619
00:32:04,490 --> 00:32:06,092
One moment, Commander.

620
00:32:06,192 --> 00:32:09,895
I have notes, which are
available for your review,

621
00:32:09,996 --> 00:32:14,566
if you should require
them at your convenience.

622
00:32:14,666 --> 00:32:15,968
[speaking german]

623
00:32:43,495 --> 00:32:45,831
[doorbell rings]

624
00:32:45,931 --> 00:32:47,466
- Dr. Memo?
- Yes.

625
00:32:47,566 --> 00:32:49,468
There was a gang attack
nearby not long ago.

626
00:32:49,568 --> 00:32:51,003
I thought since you
had a break-in earlier,

627
00:32:51,103 --> 00:32:52,338
you might be of some help.

628
00:32:52,438 --> 00:32:53,105
Hello.

629
00:32:53,205 --> 00:32:54,640
I am Professor von Kontz.

630
00:32:54,740 --> 00:32:55,707
How do you do?

631
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,476
Lieutenant Butch, LAPD.

632
00:32:57,576 --> 00:32:58,844
Your colleague?

633
00:32:58,944 --> 00:33:03,282
Yes, it appears we are both
interested in the same things.

634
00:33:03,382 --> 00:33:05,584
I hope I'm not intruding
on some secret research.

635
00:33:05,684 --> 00:33:07,086
May I come in?

636
00:33:07,186 --> 00:33:09,188
Why not indeed?

637
00:33:09,288 --> 00:33:10,789
I didn't wanna bother
you with this before,

638
00:33:10,889 --> 00:33:12,258
but we found some-- my God!

639
00:33:12,358 --> 00:33:14,560
What happened here?
Moving out?

640
00:33:14,660 --> 00:33:15,861
Part of our research.

641
00:33:15,961 --> 00:33:17,463
Quite correct.

642
00:33:17,563 --> 00:33:19,365
If you don't mind my asking,
what are you researching?

643
00:33:19,465 --> 00:33:21,800
If we knew that, we
wouldn't be searching for it.

644
00:33:21,900 --> 00:33:25,437
Anyway, like I said before,
I wanted to ask you something.

645
00:33:25,537 --> 00:33:26,505
Of course.

646
00:33:26,605 --> 00:33:28,907
We found this on
the scene of a crime.

647
00:33:29,007 --> 00:33:32,478
It's a Luger automatic pistol,
9 millimeter caliber, P-38.

648
00:33:32,578 --> 00:33:33,345
P-8.

649
00:33:33,445 --> 00:33:34,980
So you're familiar with it?

650
00:33:35,081 --> 00:33:37,949
No, but I know it very well.

651
00:33:38,050 --> 00:33:41,487
Yes, well, that's
right, a P-8.

652
00:33:41,587 --> 00:33:44,223
Anyway, Dr. Memo said
something about thugs.

653
00:33:44,323 --> 00:33:47,259
I was wondering if,
well, the thugs you saw,

654
00:33:47,359 --> 00:33:49,161
were they carrying
similar weapons?

655
00:33:49,261 --> 00:33:52,064
No, there was
nothing like that.

656
00:33:52,164 --> 00:33:54,133
Quite correct.

657
00:33:54,233 --> 00:33:56,102
I understand.

658
00:33:56,202 --> 00:33:58,003
By the way, I can't seem
to find Mr. Johnson.

659
00:33:58,104 --> 00:33:59,338
He seems to have--

660
00:33:59,438 --> 00:34:02,274
I believe he is being
taken care of right now.

661
00:34:02,374 --> 00:34:04,143
KONTZ: Quite correct.

662
00:34:04,243 --> 00:34:05,677
You know, you're
probably right.

663
00:34:05,777 --> 00:34:08,046
He probably is off with
his wife right now.

664
00:34:08,147 --> 00:34:09,515
Well, I guess I'll be going.

665
00:34:09,615 --> 00:34:11,117
It was very nice
meeting you, mister--

666
00:34:11,217 --> 00:34:12,551
Von Kontz.

667
00:34:12,651 --> 00:34:13,485
Von Kontz?

668
00:34:13,585 --> 00:34:14,186
Correct.

669
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:16,522
A pleasure, indeed.

670
00:34:16,622 --> 00:34:17,889
Come again.

671
00:34:17,989 --> 00:34:19,925
Oh, and by the way, if you
have a problem or an emergency,

672
00:34:20,025 --> 00:34:21,093
you can always call 911.

673
00:34:21,193 --> 00:34:22,027
Of course.

674
00:34:22,128 --> 00:34:23,295
Merry Christmas.

675
00:34:26,132 --> 00:34:28,467
Let's see if one comes up.

676
00:34:28,567 --> 00:34:29,701
[speaking german]

677
00:34:34,973 --> 00:34:36,542
Thank you for
your cooperation.

678
00:34:36,642 --> 00:34:39,845
When we return to Germany,
we will remember you.

679
00:34:50,322 --> 00:34:52,191
"Quite correct,
quite correct."

680
00:34:52,291 --> 00:34:54,193
Oh God, we're dead!

681
00:34:54,293 --> 00:34:56,995
Because of you and your
stupid machine, we're Dead!

682
00:34:57,095 --> 00:34:58,630
You're an optimist.

683
00:34:58,730 --> 00:35:01,767
To my mind, the situation
is worse, much worse.

684
00:35:01,867 --> 00:35:02,968
Ah, so you admit it.

685
00:35:03,068 --> 00:35:03,902
You admit it!

686
00:35:04,002 --> 00:35:04,803
[speaking german]

687
00:35:04,903 --> 00:35:06,338
What are they doing?

688
00:35:06,438 --> 00:35:08,940
Can it be that you
do not understand

689
00:35:09,040 --> 00:35:10,709
the gravity of our situation?

690
00:35:10,809 --> 00:35:11,843
Should I?

691
00:35:11,943 --> 00:35:13,212
No, of course not.

692
00:35:13,312 --> 00:35:14,480
I forget that I
live in a country

693
00:35:14,580 --> 00:35:15,881
where most students
couldn't point

694
00:35:15,981 --> 00:35:16,982
out their country on a map!

695
00:35:17,082 --> 00:35:20,018
Hey, I did OK in school.

696
00:35:20,118 --> 00:35:23,088
1941, Operation Barbarossa.

697
00:35:23,189 --> 00:35:24,723
Germany invades Russia.

698
00:35:24,823 --> 00:35:26,658
Hitler diverts troops
from the Moscow offensive

699
00:35:26,758 --> 00:35:30,362
to attack Kiev, thus postponing
the Moscow offensive by one

700
00:35:30,462 --> 00:35:32,964
year, one year crucial
to the taking of Russia

701
00:35:33,064 --> 00:35:34,466
before the Winter War.

702
00:35:34,566 --> 00:35:36,835
1942, Battle of the Caucasus.

703
00:35:36,935 --> 00:35:39,938
Germany makes a fatal error
in attacking Stalingrad.

704
00:35:40,038 --> 00:35:42,241
250,000 Germans die.

705
00:35:42,341 --> 00:35:44,176
It's the turning
point of the war.

706
00:35:44,276 --> 00:35:45,677
These are merely examples!

707
00:35:45,777 --> 00:35:46,512
Examples of what?

708
00:35:46,612 --> 00:35:49,147
Oh, think, Mr. Johnson, think!

709
00:35:49,248 --> 00:35:51,450
The Germans will probably
return to Germany

710
00:35:51,550 --> 00:35:54,553
with the historical data
that they acquire here.

711
00:35:54,653 --> 00:35:57,189
They will be able to avoid
all the mistakes they made

712
00:35:57,289 --> 00:35:58,724
during the Second World War.

713
00:35:58,824 --> 00:36:01,427
They will know Allied
tactics, strategy.

714
00:36:01,527 --> 00:36:04,296
They will even benefit
from historical analysis,

715
00:36:04,396 --> 00:36:05,997
preventing them from
making further mistakes

716
00:36:06,097 --> 00:36:11,370
thus winning the war, changing
history, changing everything!

717
00:36:11,470 --> 00:36:13,939
Yeah, but Professor,
even if they do get back,

718
00:36:14,039 --> 00:36:15,106
who's gonna believe them?

719
00:36:15,207 --> 00:36:17,108
Anybody can fake
historical records.

720
00:36:17,209 --> 00:36:18,444
What about the atomic bomb?

721
00:36:18,544 --> 00:36:20,312
They could look through
any of my physics books

722
00:36:20,412 --> 00:36:23,549
and get a blueprint
for an atomic bomb!

723
00:36:23,649 --> 00:36:26,084
Modern jet fighters,
military hardware--

724
00:36:26,184 --> 00:36:27,919
there's an entire
range of technology

725
00:36:28,019 --> 00:36:29,755
that becomes available to them.

726
00:36:29,855 --> 00:36:33,058
I tell you, Mr. Johnson,
we are on the verge

727
00:36:33,158 --> 00:36:35,961
of rewriting World War II.

728
00:36:36,061 --> 00:36:37,463
All right.

729
00:36:37,563 --> 00:36:40,532
All right, Professor, but
because we are standing here

730
00:36:40,632 --> 00:36:44,703
talking now, and know that
history hasn't been changed,

731
00:36:44,803 --> 00:36:47,806
we know that the Nazis
won't manage to get back,

732
00:36:47,906 --> 00:36:48,840
and so therefore we--

733
00:36:48,940 --> 00:36:50,141
Good reasoning, Mr. Johnson.

734
00:36:50,242 --> 00:36:52,210
Essentially right, but
fundamentally wrong!

735
00:36:52,311 --> 00:36:54,413
The instant that the Nazis
step through that vortex

736
00:36:54,513 --> 00:36:57,115
and return to their place of
origin, that is when things

737
00:36:57,215 --> 00:36:58,484
would change for you and me.

738
00:36:58,584 --> 00:37:00,218
You would probably be
a member of the Party,

739
00:37:00,319 --> 00:37:02,554
and I would be, oh, the
minister of propaganda,

740
00:37:02,654 --> 00:37:03,722
something along those lines.

741
00:37:03,822 --> 00:37:05,123
You mean everything
would change?

742
00:37:05,223 --> 00:37:06,091
Me, my wife?

743
00:37:06,191 --> 00:37:07,393
Wife?

744
00:37:07,493 --> 00:37:09,461
In a Nazi regime, you
would be the product

745
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:10,762
of genetic manipulation.

746
00:37:10,862 --> 00:37:12,230
You wouldn't need a wife!

747
00:37:12,331 --> 00:37:13,399
What about my car?

748
00:37:13,499 --> 00:37:15,367
You'd probably
drive a Volkswagen.

749
00:37:15,467 --> 00:37:16,502
I don't think we insure those.

750
00:37:16,602 --> 00:37:18,236
In plain language,
Mr. Johnson,

751
00:37:18,337 --> 00:37:20,706
if we do not prevent these
Germans from returning

752
00:37:20,806 --> 00:37:26,111
to the Germany of 1942, not
Eisenhower, not Patton, not

753
00:37:26,211 --> 00:37:29,247
Stalin, not DeGaulle,
not Churchill,

754
00:37:29,348 --> 00:37:31,216
nobody will be able
to prevent them

755
00:37:31,317 --> 00:37:34,553
from using their
information to win the war!

756
00:37:34,653 --> 00:37:37,456
Think of this as the
last battle of World War

757
00:37:37,556 --> 00:37:41,593
II, the final showdown,
the ultimate confrontation,

758
00:37:41,693 --> 00:37:44,863
the essential struggle
between good and evil!

759
00:37:53,238 --> 00:37:54,473
Mom, I can't believe this.

760
00:37:54,573 --> 00:37:55,874
He's missing Christmas.

761
00:37:55,974 --> 00:37:57,743
Now, dear, I'm sure there
must be an explanation.

762
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,110
Explanation?

763
00:37:59,210 --> 00:38:01,012
Mother, when I left, he was
watching our neighbor's house

764
00:38:01,112 --> 00:38:02,481
with binoculars.

765
00:38:02,581 --> 00:38:04,215
The night before, he wouldn't
sleep because of noises.

766
00:38:04,316 --> 00:38:06,217
I don't know what I'm
gonna do with that man.

767
00:38:06,318 --> 00:38:08,253
Well, I can hardly
believe Fred would--

768
00:38:08,354 --> 00:38:10,188
Mom, he's going crazy.

769
00:38:10,288 --> 00:38:12,491
Noises and this and that.

770
00:38:12,591 --> 00:38:14,292
Next thing you know,
he'll be hearing music.

771
00:38:16,962 --> 00:38:18,597
[german music playing]

772
00:39:24,996 --> 00:39:26,998
[speaking german]

773
00:40:00,331 --> 00:40:01,299
-

774
00:40:01,399 --> 00:40:05,871
Yes, yes, 1, 2,
3, 4, and 1, 2.

775
00:40:05,971 --> 00:40:06,872
Come on, you can do it.

776
00:40:06,972 --> 00:40:08,306
1, 2, 3, 4.

777
00:40:08,406 --> 00:40:09,240
Yeah!

778
00:40:09,340 --> 00:40:10,241
1, 2.

779
00:40:10,341 --> 00:40:13,244
And 1, 2, 3, 4.

780
00:40:13,344 --> 00:40:14,245
And 1, yes, that's the way.

781
00:40:14,345 --> 00:40:17,015
1 and 2, and 1 and 2.

782
00:40:17,115 --> 00:40:19,384
And 1 and 2 and 3 and 4.

783
00:40:19,485 --> 00:40:20,919
And you can do it.
Come on.

784
00:40:21,019 --> 00:40:21,920
That's great.

785
00:40:22,020 --> 00:40:23,922
1 and 2 and 3 and 4,

786
00:40:24,022 --> 00:40:26,492
[laughter]

787
00:40:36,968 --> 00:40:38,670
And 1 and 2, 3,4.

788
00:40:38,770 --> 00:40:40,271
Come on, yes, that's the way.

789
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:41,907
1 and 2 and 1--

790
00:40:42,007 --> 00:40:43,875
[speaking german]

791
00:40:54,185 --> 00:40:55,186
A little pixie, isn't she?

792
00:40:59,725 --> 00:41:03,328
My men are not used to
this form of entertainment.

793
00:41:03,428 --> 00:41:05,230
It upsets their morale.

794
00:41:05,330 --> 00:41:06,532
Yeah, well, I agree.

795
00:41:06,632 --> 00:41:10,536
My men have trained
hard for this mission.

796
00:41:10,636 --> 00:41:12,638
You will cooperate and
lead them to key areas

797
00:41:12,738 --> 00:41:15,206
of interest in the city
to gather information

798
00:41:15,306 --> 00:41:18,076
of military significance.

799
00:41:18,176 --> 00:41:20,979
I'm putting you in charge.

800
00:41:21,079 --> 00:41:21,947
In charge?

801
00:41:22,047 --> 00:41:23,481
Yes.

802
00:41:23,582 --> 00:41:26,251
You will not be back
here before 5:00.

803
00:41:26,351 --> 00:41:29,655
I need silence to work.

804
00:41:29,755 --> 00:41:32,157
Otherwise, I shoot you.

805
00:41:32,257 --> 00:41:33,491
Yes. yes, sir.

806
00:41:33,592 --> 00:41:35,994
[speaking german]

807
00:42:40,125 --> 00:42:42,227
[speaking german]

808
00:42:47,232 --> 00:42:48,033
That will be all.

809
00:42:48,133 --> 00:42:50,669
[speaking german]

810
00:42:50,769 --> 00:42:53,338
Dr. Memo, please, sit down.

811
00:42:59,044 --> 00:43:02,614
I called you here because
I want to congratulate

812
00:43:02,714 --> 00:43:05,383
a man that I think is a genius.

813
00:43:05,483 --> 00:43:11,890
Your machine, Dr. Memo, is
a true wonder of technology.

814
00:43:11,990 --> 00:43:14,626
Our group engineer informs
me that our trip would not

815
00:43:14,726 --> 00:43:16,795
have been possible without you.

816
00:43:16,895 --> 00:43:18,964
The machine in Germany would
not have worked by itself.

817
00:43:19,064 --> 00:43:21,867
Your machine allowed
us to be transported.

818
00:43:21,967 --> 00:43:23,534
The machine is more
powerful than you

819
00:43:23,635 --> 00:43:26,171
could possibly imagine.

820
00:43:26,271 --> 00:43:28,539
Well, fortunately,
we were able to use

821
00:43:28,640 --> 00:43:30,141
your notes to operate it.

822
00:43:30,241 --> 00:43:33,511
By this evening, we
will have recreated

823
00:43:33,611 --> 00:43:36,948
a tunnel in the vortex of the
machine which brought us here.

824
00:43:37,048 --> 00:43:39,785
We will then be ready
to return to 1942.

825
00:43:39,885 --> 00:43:42,087
And to see Germany
lose the war.

826
00:43:42,187 --> 00:43:43,655
Absolutely not.

827
00:43:43,755 --> 00:43:45,757
Because of the facts
available here,

828
00:43:45,857 --> 00:43:49,961
it will now be possible
for Germany to win the war!

829
00:43:50,061 --> 00:43:54,666
However, I do not believe
my mission would be complete

830
00:43:54,766 --> 00:43:59,104
if I did not attempt to
convince a genius like yourself

831
00:43:59,204 --> 00:44:01,172
to return to Germany
with us to contribute

832
00:44:01,272 --> 00:44:04,876
his work, his knowledge, to
the Reich, to the Fuhrer,

833
00:44:04,976 --> 00:44:09,881
to share in the glory and
the vision of Germany.

834
00:44:09,981 --> 00:44:12,684
As your grandfather did
before you with the zeppelin.

835
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:14,886
My grandfather
was a scientist,

836
00:44:14,986 --> 00:44:17,088
not a supporter of a
regime run by a madman!

837
00:44:20,158 --> 00:44:23,962
I too have read
the history books.

838
00:44:24,062 --> 00:44:26,597
And yet the Fuhrer
brought Germany out

839
00:44:26,698 --> 00:44:29,134
of ruins and into prosperity!

840
00:44:29,234 --> 00:44:33,471
And he will succeed where
Napoleon and Alexander

841
00:44:33,571 --> 00:44:35,040
the Great could not.

842
00:44:35,140 --> 00:44:37,208
Your leader will go down in
flames and take all of Germany

843
00:44:37,308 --> 00:44:38,576
with him!

844
00:44:38,676 --> 00:44:44,615
Dr. Memo, once I return to
Germany, the war will be won.

845
00:44:44,716 --> 00:44:47,685
All of this will be incorrect.

846
00:44:47,786 --> 00:44:49,855
By coming here,
even by an accident,

847
00:44:49,955 --> 00:44:51,790
you have been offered a
glimpse into the reality

848
00:44:51,890 --> 00:44:52,924
of your struggle.

849
00:44:53,024 --> 00:44:54,425
You see what you
are fighting for!

850
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:55,927
This is not Alexander the Great!

851
00:44:56,027 --> 00:45:00,766
Tyranny of the
lazy and incompetent!

852
00:45:00,866 --> 00:45:05,971
That is what your democracy
has brought you, Dr. Memo!

853
00:45:06,071 --> 00:45:11,376
Americans are undisciplined
and have drawn the entire world

854
00:45:11,476 --> 00:45:14,312
into their lack of discipline!

855
00:45:14,412 --> 00:45:18,483
The world will sink without
a Reich to bring order!

856
00:45:21,486 --> 00:45:29,527
But as long as I am in command
here, order there will be!

857
00:45:29,627 --> 00:45:31,496
That is a fact

858
00:45:31,596 --> 00:45:34,099

859
00:45:48,146 --> 00:45:50,048

What is that?

863
00:47:36,321 --> 00:47:37,488
What is that?

864
00:47:37,588 --> 00:47:39,790
I didn't buy it?

[speaking german]

868
00:48:17,328 --> 00:48:19,864
Ah, Mr. Johnson,
right on time.

869
00:48:19,965 --> 00:48:21,599
All is ready.

870
00:48:21,699 --> 00:48:22,934
We're short on
time, Professor.

871
00:48:23,034 --> 00:48:24,435
This von Kontz is losing it.

872
00:48:24,535 --> 00:48:28,006
That is why I have prepared
a viable escape plan.

873
00:48:32,910 --> 00:48:33,711
What are you doing?

874
00:48:33,811 --> 00:48:35,746
What are you going?

875
00:48:35,846 --> 00:48:37,415
Don't you understand,
Mr. Johnson?

876
00:48:37,515 --> 00:48:40,918
The Germans have taken one
teleportation chamber upstairs,

877
00:48:41,019 --> 00:48:42,887
but they've left us the other.

878
00:48:42,988 --> 00:48:44,889
Conceivably,
therefore, one of us

879
00:48:44,990 --> 00:48:47,092
should be able to teleport
into the living room

880
00:48:47,192 --> 00:48:48,726
without the Germans noticing.

881
00:48:48,826 --> 00:48:50,495
Then we can go for help!
- That's great.

882
00:48:50,595 --> 00:48:51,829
That's a wonderful idea.

883
00:48:51,929 --> 00:48:53,731
That'd be like landing
right on top of them.

884
00:48:53,831 --> 00:48:55,833
They'll never suspect it!

885
00:48:55,933 --> 00:48:57,235
One could sneak through.

886
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:05,110
Well, do you--

887
00:49:05,210 --> 00:49:09,947
do you really think you
could escape, Professor?

888
00:49:10,048 --> 00:49:11,116
Professor Memo?

889
00:49:15,653 --> 00:49:17,455
Have you ever tried
this thing on a human?

890
00:49:17,555 --> 00:49:19,557
I didn't have a
Guinea pig available.

891
00:49:19,657 --> 00:49:22,060
Theory suggests the
trip should be safe.

892
00:49:22,160 --> 00:49:23,328
Which theory?

893
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:26,131
Listen, according
to my calculations,

894
00:49:26,231 --> 00:49:27,798
the Germans will
enter the vortex

895
00:49:27,898 --> 00:49:29,934
to leave for Germany
with the military

896
00:49:30,035 --> 00:49:33,438
and the historical
records any moment now.

897
00:49:33,538 --> 00:49:35,106
You must stop them.

898
00:49:35,206 --> 00:49:38,876
You are mankind's last chance!

899
00:49:38,976 --> 00:49:40,645
And they said I'd
never amount to anything.

900
00:49:40,745 --> 00:49:41,779
Good luck.

901
00:49:41,879 --> 00:49:43,181
You too.

902
00:49:43,281 --> 00:49:46,084
You know, Professor, if
the Germans wound up here,

903
00:49:46,184 --> 00:49:48,186
how do we know I'm gonna
wind up inside the house

904
00:49:48,286 --> 00:49:50,788
and not in some other machine
in the past or the future

905
00:49:50,888 --> 00:49:55,826
with them?
- Well, we don't.

906
00:49:55,926 --> 00:49:57,328
And you're sure
this thing is safe?

907
00:49:57,428 --> 00:49:59,330
I had to make some minor
adjustments on the machine.

908
00:49:59,430 --> 00:50:03,000
On a trip this short, you
may feel some side effects,

909
00:50:03,101 --> 00:50:05,703
but that is a risk I
shall have to take!

910
00:50:05,803 --> 00:50:06,671
It's our only chance.

911
00:50:09,174 --> 00:50:10,275
What about you?

912
00:50:10,375 --> 00:50:14,479
I stay here to
operate the consoles.

913
00:50:14,579 --> 00:50:15,980
Wait!

914
00:50:16,081 --> 00:50:18,015
Check for flies.
- Will you hurry?

915
00:50:24,155 --> 00:50:25,022
[dog barking]

916
00:50:25,123 --> 00:50:27,592

917
00:51:51,041 --> 00:51:52,710
[speaking german]

918
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:04,822
Finally, you're here!

919
00:52:04,922 --> 00:52:06,191
We've still got a Nazi problem.

920
00:52:06,291 --> 00:52:08,159
I see you have a Nazi
problem, Mr. Johnson,

921
00:52:08,259 --> 00:52:10,328
but this is Christmas,
and I do not.

922
00:52:10,428 --> 00:52:11,729
You can't keep
calling the police

923
00:52:11,829 --> 00:52:12,763
every time you hear a noise.

924
00:52:12,863 --> 00:52:14,732
All right, all right, come on.

925
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:15,900
Take a look at this.

926
00:52:16,000 --> 00:52:17,235
These guys are
everywhere out here.

927
00:52:23,741 --> 00:52:25,710
I don't see
anything, Mr. Johnson.

928
00:52:25,810 --> 00:52:27,778
Well, they must be hiding
in the bushes or something.

929
00:52:27,878 --> 00:52:28,713
I swear there were--

930
00:52:28,813 --> 00:52:30,248
I saw people out there!

931
00:52:30,348 --> 00:52:32,450
Is there anything else you
wanna show me, Mr. Johnson?

932
00:52:32,550 --> 00:52:34,185
How did you get to
be such a lousy cop?

933
00:52:34,285 --> 00:52:35,586
Explain that to me, will you?

934
00:52:35,686 --> 00:52:37,188
Well, if you think I've
got nothing better to do,

935
00:52:37,288 --> 00:52:38,523
you're dead wrong.

936
00:52:38,623 --> 00:52:40,024
Not to mention the fact
you called me here three

937
00:52:40,124 --> 00:52:41,659
times for no good
reason, and now

938
00:52:41,759 --> 00:52:44,829
you're talking about claims of
Nazis and a teleport chamber!

939
00:52:44,929 --> 00:52:47,598
Mr. Johnson, I've got a real
investigation on my hands

940
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:48,833
right now.

941
00:52:48,933 --> 00:52:50,368
Two people have been killed
not too far from here.

942
00:52:50,468 --> 00:52:51,969
Well, maybe the Nazis did it.

943
00:52:52,069 --> 00:52:53,871
They left a lot
behind, didn't they?

944
00:52:53,971 --> 00:52:54,972
We've gotta get
back-up out here.

945
00:52:55,072 --> 00:52:56,541
We need-- we need SWAT teams.

946
00:52:56,641 --> 00:52:58,175
That's suspicion,
not evidence.

947
00:52:58,276 --> 00:53:00,445
I'm not calling back-up
based upon your suspicions.

948
00:53:00,545 --> 00:53:02,179
You get back-up out here now.

949
00:53:02,280 --> 00:53:03,614
These guys are Nazis,
I'm telling you.

950
00:53:03,714 --> 00:53:06,584
And if we don't stop them,
we'll all be Nazis too.

951
00:53:06,684 --> 00:53:10,154
Yes, Mr. Johnson,
I can see that.

952
00:53:10,255 --> 00:53:12,690
[speaking german]

953
00:53:16,694 --> 00:53:22,733
Dr. Memo, where is
Mr. Lopez, Eddie Lopez?

954
00:53:22,833 --> 00:53:23,634
I don't know.

955
00:53:28,273 --> 00:53:31,976
This is a Luger
pistol, a Luger pistol.

956
00:53:32,076 --> 00:53:34,144
Toggle joint, breech lock.

957
00:53:34,245 --> 00:53:35,946
Very precise instrument.

959
00:53:46,524 --> 00:53:50,060
Fred Johnson, California

960
00:53:50,160 --> 00:53:52,363
living on Grandon Avenue.

[dog barking]

963
00:54:20,358 --> 00:54:21,326
All right, you
wanted evidence?

964
00:54:21,426 --> 00:54:22,727
There's your evidence.

965
00:54:22,827 --> 00:54:23,761
My God.

966
00:54:23,861 --> 00:54:25,363
They're armed with
semi-automatic weapons!

967
00:54:25,463 --> 00:54:27,798
What did you expect
Nazis to be using, BB guns?

968
00:54:30,368 --> 00:54:32,837
They're surrounding the house!

969
00:54:32,937 --> 00:54:35,373
[speaking german]

970
00:54:40,478 --> 00:54:42,747
OK, they just connect
to the upstairs phone.

971
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:43,748
Should I try to--

972
00:54:43,848 --> 00:54:45,082
No time for that
now, Mr. Johnson.

973
00:54:45,182 --> 00:54:46,183
Consider this a
moment of crisis.

974
00:54:46,283 --> 00:54:47,652
We gotta hold the premises.

975
00:54:47,752 --> 00:54:49,053
Know any martial
arts, judo, karate?

976
00:54:49,153 --> 00:54:50,254
- Yoga.
- Yoga?

977
00:54:50,355 --> 00:54:51,422
Yeah, yoga.

978
00:54:51,522 --> 00:54:52,590
You know what this
is, Mr. Johnson?

979
00:54:52,690 --> 00:54:53,924
It's a gun.

980
00:54:54,024 --> 00:54:56,527
It's a Colt. Lock breech
pistol, standardized in 1926.

981
00:54:56,627 --> 00:54:58,796
Since then, seen
no further change.

982
00:54:58,896 --> 00:55:00,331
Needs none.

984
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:08,873
Let's separate.

985
00:55:08,973 --> 00:55:09,774
You're kidding, right?

986
00:55:09,874 --> 00:55:11,108
It'll surprise them.

987
00:55:11,208 --> 00:55:12,042
Come on, move!

988
00:55:21,118 --> 00:55:23,421

991
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,376
Where is Mr. Johnson?

992
00:56:19,477 --> 00:56:21,412
We know he lives here.

993
00:56:21,512 --> 00:56:23,548
Guys, I really don't
know any Mr. Johnson.

994
00:56:26,484 --> 00:56:28,986
I'll give you three seconds.

995
00:56:29,086 --> 00:56:29,887
And then I shoot you.

996
00:56:36,193 --> 00:56:50,941
1, 2, 3.

997
00:56:51,041 --> 00:56:52,276
Goodbye.

1005
00:58:21,632 --> 00:58:22,767
but please leave a
message and we'll get

1006

Fred, are you there?

00:58:30,608 --> 00:58:32,076
Please pick up the phone.

1011
00:58:32,176 --> 00:58:35,079
Oh God, Fred, are we gonna let
it all slip away like this?

Freeze!

1019
00:59:36,106 --> 00:59:37,007
We're tied down.

1020
00:59:37,107 --> 00:59:39,009
Yeah, I noticed.

1021
00:59:39,109 --> 00:59:40,577
You're wearing one
of their uniforms.

1022
00:59:40,678 --> 00:59:41,846
Yeah, so?

1023
00:59:41,946 --> 00:59:43,280
Maybe they'll think
you're one of them.

1024
00:59:43,380 --> 00:59:44,414
What if they think I'm not?

1025
00:59:44,514 --> 00:59:45,983
I'll cover you.

1026
00:59:46,083 --> 00:59:47,051
What?

1027
00:59:47,151 --> 00:59:47,985

1029
01:00:08,305 --> 01:00:09,106
Stand back.

I'll shoot the lock.

[lightning cracks]

1032
01:00:21,551 --> 01:00:23,553
He's stolen the records.

1033
01:00:23,654 --> 01:00:24,822
He's gonna change history!

1034
01:00:24,922 --> 01:00:25,555
What?

1035
01:00:25,656 --> 01:00:26,757
I'm going after him.

1036
01:00:26,857 --> 01:00:28,258
You're gonna what?

1037
01:00:28,358 --> 01:00:32,162
There are some things they
don't sell insurance for.

1038
01:00:32,262 --> 01:00:34,164
Mr. Johnson, wait!

Whoa!

1042
01:01:15,706 --> 01:01:16,573
I just dropped in.

1043
01:01:16,673 --> 01:01:17,975
So I see.

1044
01:01:18,075 --> 01:01:19,744
Never expected
anything like this.

1045
01:01:19,844 --> 01:01:21,011
All right, but you
gotta help me now.

1046
01:01:21,111 --> 01:01:22,479
We've gotta get
those records back.

1047
01:01:22,579 --> 01:01:24,048
All right, whatever.

1048
01:01:24,148 --> 01:01:25,549
I just want you know any of
this is out of my jurisdiction.

1049
01:01:25,649 --> 01:01:26,616
Yeah, I understand.

1050
01:01:26,717 --> 01:01:28,118
I understand.

1051
01:01:28,218 --> 01:01:30,487
Here, let me introduce you
to another friend of mine.

[cheering]

1055
01:02:02,019 --> 01:02:04,021
All right, Mr. Johnson,
where are the records?

1056
01:02:04,121 --> 01:02:06,023
I don't know where I am!

1057
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:07,992
OK, we'll follow the guard.

01:02:44,728 --> 01:02:47,231
[humming]

1059
01:02:57,741 --> 01:02:58,909
Could be the room
we're looking for.

1060
01:02:59,009 --> 01:03:00,044
How do you know?
how do you know?

1061
01:03:00,144 --> 01:03:01,178
- Shh.
- Heil Hitler.

1062
01:03:19,563 --> 01:03:20,764
Damn a secretary!

1063
01:03:20,865 --> 01:03:21,798
After all we've been through?

1064
01:03:21,899 --> 01:03:23,000
It's just a secretary.

1065
01:03:23,100 --> 01:03:24,601
That's not the point.

1066
01:03:24,701 --> 01:03:27,872
She calls the alarm, every Nazi
in this place'll be in on us.

1067
01:03:27,972 --> 01:03:30,507
I gotta think.

1068
01:03:30,607 --> 01:03:31,876
That's it.
- What?

1069
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:32,910
The uniform.

1070
01:03:33,010 --> 01:03:34,211
Pretend you're a German.

1071
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:34,945
It worked before.

1072
01:03:35,045 --> 01:03:35,980
I don't speak German!

1073
01:03:36,080 --> 01:03:37,081
Then seduce her.

1074
01:03:37,181 --> 01:03:37,848
What?

1075
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:39,516
- Do something.
- No.

1076
01:03:39,616 --> 01:03:40,484
Forget it.

1077
01:03:40,584 --> 01:03:41,418
Go!

1078
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,159
Heil Hitler.

1079
01:03:49,259 --> 01:03:50,060
Ja?

1080
01:03:52,729 --> 01:03:54,198
Voulez-vous coucher avec moi?

1081
01:04:00,537 --> 01:04:01,605
You fool!

1082
01:04:01,705 --> 01:04:03,207
I told you I
don't speak German!

1083
01:04:03,307 --> 01:04:04,942
Body language, you could
have used body language.

1084
01:04:05,042 --> 01:04:06,443
Body language this!

1085
01:04:06,543 --> 01:04:08,512
You know, I'm sick and tired
of you ordering me around!

1086
01:04:08,612 --> 01:04:10,380
Shh!

1087
01:04:10,480 --> 01:04:11,381
I hear voices.

1088
01:04:11,481 --> 01:04:12,782
[speaking german]

1089
01:04:12,883 --> 01:04:13,717
They're in there.

1090
01:04:13,817 --> 01:04:14,885
That could be anybody.

1091
01:04:14,985 --> 01:04:16,453
There's only one
way to find out.

1092
01:04:16,553 --> 01:04:18,788
What?

1093
01:04:18,889 --> 01:04:20,124
Sorry, Mr. Johnson.

1094
01:04:29,433 --> 01:04:30,600
[speaking german]

1095
01:04:34,404 --> 01:04:35,940
Mr. Johnson!

1096
01:04:36,040 --> 01:04:38,608
Yes, and now I'll--

1097
01:04:38,708 --> 01:04:39,876
I'll take those records back.

1098
01:04:41,912 --> 01:04:42,913
Please?

1099
01:04:47,151 --> 01:04:50,420
I told you this
wasn't gonna work.

1100
01:04:50,520 --> 01:04:51,721
Freeze, LAPD!

1101
01:04:51,821 --> 01:04:52,656
Is this them?

1102
01:04:52,756 --> 01:04:53,690
Yeah.

1103
01:04:53,790 --> 01:04:54,858
Yeah, that's von Kontz there.

1104
01:04:54,959 --> 01:04:56,927
And that must be
Muck, the inventor.

1105
01:04:57,027 --> 01:04:58,362
[speaking german]

1106
01:05:00,130 --> 01:05:01,231
- Who's he?
- I don't know.

1107
01:05:01,331 --> 01:05:04,634
Who are you?
[speaking german]

1108
01:05:04,734 --> 01:05:05,902
Oh, OK.
I know.

1109
01:05:06,003 --> 01:05:07,071
He must be the one
who's supposed to take

1110
01:05:07,171 --> 01:05:08,405
the records back to Hitler.

1111
01:05:08,505 --> 01:05:09,473
All right, Mr. Johnson.

1112
01:05:09,573 --> 01:05:10,807
Why don't you get
the records and let's

1113
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:11,908
get the hell out of here?
- Yeah.

1114
01:05:14,878 --> 01:05:16,480
- Come on, come on.
- I'm trying!

1115
01:05:23,120 --> 01:05:24,488
All right, we're
gonna bolt this door.

1116
01:05:24,588 --> 01:05:27,191
I hear one peep from anybody,
you're all sauerkraut!

1117
01:05:27,291 --> 01:05:29,459
I assure you,
we will be silent.

1118
01:05:39,903 --> 01:05:41,138
- My God?
- What?

1119
01:05:41,238 --> 01:05:43,140
She's gone.
The secretary is gone.

1120
01:05:43,240 --> 01:05:44,108
She went to get help.

1121
01:05:44,208 --> 01:05:45,442
There's no time to waste.

1122
01:05:45,542 --> 01:05:46,376
All right, let's go.

1123
01:05:46,476 --> 01:05:47,377
[alarm wails]

1124
01:05:47,477 --> 01:05:48,378
Too late.

1125
01:05:48,478 --> 01:05:49,279
Come on, hurry!

1126
01:05:49,379 --> 01:05:50,780
OK.

1127
01:05:50,880 --> 01:05:52,382
[dogs barking]

1128
01:05:52,482 --> 01:05:53,750
We're toast!

1129
01:05:53,850 --> 01:05:54,751
Puppy chow.

1130
01:05:54,851 --> 01:05:57,354
[speaking german]

1131
01:06:35,225 --> 01:06:36,326
In the machine, quick!

1132
01:06:40,597 --> 01:06:44,101
I am afraid it is
too late for that.

1133
01:06:44,201 --> 01:06:45,602
Drop your guns.

1134
01:06:45,702 --> 01:06:47,204
[clattering]

1135
01:06:47,304 --> 01:06:48,138
That's impossible.

1136
01:06:48,238 --> 01:06:49,106
How did you get here?

1137
01:06:49,206 --> 01:06:50,474
Pure science, Lieutenant.

1138
01:06:50,574 --> 01:06:52,142
We have a second
teleportation chamber

1139
01:06:52,242 --> 01:06:53,643
right here in this bunker.

1140
01:06:53,743 --> 01:06:57,481
We can teleport right into
this room and wait for you.

1141
01:06:57,581 --> 01:07:00,117
If you hadn't rushed
me, we could have checked!

1142
01:07:00,217 --> 01:07:01,151
"Run, Mr. Johnson.

1143
01:07:01,251 --> 01:07:02,319
Hurry, Mr. Johnson!"

1144
01:07:02,419 --> 01:07:03,587
Professor Muck, be reasonable.

1145
01:07:03,687 --> 01:07:07,891
The time of reason is past!

1146
01:07:07,991 --> 01:07:11,595
Now it is time to eliminate
the last opposing elements.

1147
01:07:11,695 --> 01:07:13,997
I shall miss you both.

1148
01:07:14,098 --> 01:07:15,299
My sincere regrets.

1149
01:07:15,399 --> 01:07:18,735
We will shoot you finally.

1150
01:07:18,835 --> 01:07:20,137
Auf Wiedersehen.

1151
01:07:28,578 --> 01:07:31,081
[speaking german]

1152
01:07:58,342 --> 01:07:59,376
Let's get out of here!

1153
01:08:07,251 --> 01:08:09,719
[speaking german]

1154
01:08:27,771 --> 01:08:30,274
[shouting]

1155
01:08:49,526 --> 01:08:54,598
I think we should
call the police.

1156
01:08:54,698 --> 01:08:56,300
For once, I agree.

1157
01:08:56,400 --> 01:08:57,534
You think we have a case?

1158
01:09:02,206 --> 01:09:04,574
[chuckling]

1159
01:09:42,979 --> 01:09:44,414
All right, let's go.

1160
01:09:44,514 --> 01:09:46,182
We are reporting live from
Antelope Valley, California

1161
01:09:46,283 --> 01:09:47,717
with Professor Alexander Memo.

1162
01:09:47,817 --> 01:09:50,153
Professor, if you wouldn't
mind, from the beginning?

1163
01:09:50,254 --> 01:09:52,756
I have a new invention,
an improvement!

1164
01:09:52,856 --> 01:09:56,059
Imagine, if you will, 10,000
horses running together

1165
01:09:56,159 --> 01:10:02,332
in a synchronous manner, but on
a magnetic paralytic converter.

1166
01:10:02,432 --> 01:10:05,369
I guess I owe you an
apology, Mr. Johnson.

1167
01:10:05,469 --> 01:10:08,071
I should have believed you.

1168
01:10:08,171 --> 01:10:10,073
You deserve a medal.

1169
01:10:10,173 --> 01:10:12,175
Yeah, well.

1170
01:10:12,276 --> 01:10:14,010
Is your wife back yet?

1171
01:10:14,110 --> 01:10:15,078
Uh, no.

1172
01:10:15,178 --> 01:10:15,979
So what are you gonna do?

1173
01:10:19,115 --> 01:10:19,916
Celebrate?

1174
01:10:25,655 --> 01:10:28,825
All right, let's move 'em out.

1175
01:10:28,925 --> 01:10:30,694
In this case, it
should be theoretically

1176
01:10:30,794 --> 01:10:35,231
possible to arrive at your
destination before you depart.

1177
01:10:35,332 --> 01:10:36,232
Before you depart?

1178
01:10:36,333 --> 01:10:37,267
Before you depart.

1179
01:10:37,367 --> 01:10:39,769
How are you doing, sir?

1180
01:10:39,869 --> 01:10:40,670
Before you depart?

1181
01:11:07,831 --> 01:11:09,165
Mommy, is Daddy home?

1182
01:11:09,265 --> 01:11:10,334
He'd better be!

1183
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:20,710
Daddy, Daddy, we had a
really big Christmas tree.

1184
01:11:20,810 --> 01:11:24,180
Daddy, Daddy, we had a
really big Christmas tree.

1185
01:11:24,280 --> 01:11:25,148
Yeah, you missed it.

1186
01:11:25,248 --> 01:11:26,049
Yeah?

1187
01:11:26,149 --> 01:11:27,216
Oh well.

1188
01:11:27,317 --> 01:11:28,985
OK, go upstairs, you two.

1189
01:11:29,085 --> 01:11:30,019
But Mom, please?

1190
01:11:30,119 --> 01:11:31,755
Come on.

1191
01:11:31,855 --> 01:11:34,758
So you spent
Christmas in bed, huh?

1192
01:11:34,858 --> 01:11:35,725
No.

1193
01:11:35,825 --> 01:11:36,660
No, actually.

1194
01:11:36,760 --> 01:11:37,861
I--

1195
01:11:37,961 --> 01:11:39,463
I hope the noises aren't
bothering you anymore.

1196
01:11:39,563 --> 01:11:41,164
Nope.
No more noises.

1197
01:11:41,264 --> 01:11:42,366
That's all over.

1198
01:11:42,466 --> 01:11:43,767
OK, where are they?

1199
01:11:43,867 --> 01:11:44,601
What?

1200
01:11:44,701 --> 01:11:46,102
Come on, where are they, Fred?

1201
01:11:46,202 --> 01:11:47,136
What, the Nazis?

1202
01:11:47,236 --> 01:11:48,872
No, come on, the binoculars.

1203
01:11:48,972 --> 01:11:49,873
The binoculars.

1204
01:11:49,973 --> 01:11:50,907
Acknowledge my intelligence.

1205
01:11:51,007 --> 01:11:53,377
I mean, it's the least I expect.

1206
01:11:53,477 --> 01:11:55,311
Honey, you know I--

1207
01:11:55,412 --> 01:11:57,681
That is what you get
for missing Christmas!

1208
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:18,201
Enough.

1209
01:12:18,301 --> 01:12:19,469
All right, that's it.

1210
01:12:19,569 --> 01:12:20,370
I've had it with you
ordering me around.

1211
01:12:20,470 --> 01:12:21,304
Do you hear me?

1212
01:12:21,405 --> 01:12:23,507
That's the end of it.

1213
01:12:23,607 --> 01:12:24,974
Are you paying
attention to me or what?

1214
01:12:34,183 --> 01:12:38,321
Yeah, well, there you have it.

1215
01:12:38,422 --> 01:12:39,689
Fred, I--

1216
01:12:39,789 --> 01:12:44,160
And if I ruined Christmas
for you, I'm sorry.

1217
01:12:44,260 --> 01:12:45,128
Oh!

1218
01:12:45,228 --> 01:12:46,095
Come on, Janie.

1219
01:12:46,195 --> 01:12:47,664
Mom isn't mad anymore!

1220
01:12:50,333 --> 01:12:51,501
I drew a picture, Dad.

1221
01:12:51,601 --> 01:12:52,902
It's you watching
the neighbor's house.

1222
01:12:53,002 --> 01:12:53,903
Great.

1223
01:12:54,003 --> 01:12:55,705
What's with that
neighbor, anyway?

1224
01:12:55,805 --> 01:12:59,075
Oh, he's a scientist,
a man of vision.

1225
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:01,511
Whatever his vision might be.

1226
01:13:01,611 --> 01:13:02,812
Well, I think he's leaving.

1227
01:13:02,912 --> 01:13:05,549
I saw him getting into
a taxi cab outside.

1228
01:13:05,649 --> 01:13:06,750
Oh?

1229
01:13:06,850 --> 01:13:07,484
Here, wait.

1230
01:13:07,584 --> 01:13:08,618
I'll be right back.

1231
01:13:17,427 --> 01:13:18,227
Whoa, Professor.

1232
01:13:18,327 --> 01:13:19,896
You're leaving us?

1233
01:13:19,996 --> 01:13:22,131
Albeit I did intend
to say goodbye.

1234
01:13:22,231 --> 01:13:23,733
Another research trip?

1235
01:13:23,833 --> 01:13:26,636
This teleportation machine has
earned me quite a reputation.

1236
01:13:26,736 --> 01:13:28,472
I've been asked to
lecture at universities

1237
01:13:28,572 --> 01:13:31,207
and scientific conventions
all across the country.

1238
01:13:31,307 --> 01:13:33,042
So the Memo
tradition lives on.

1239
01:13:33,142 --> 01:13:34,744
Only because of you.

1240
01:13:34,844 --> 01:13:37,313
I owe you my life, my invention.

1241
01:13:37,413 --> 01:13:40,249
I am greatly in your debt.

1242
01:13:40,349 --> 01:13:42,151
Hey, how long you need?

1243
01:13:42,251 --> 01:13:45,054
I don't like this neighborhood!

1244
01:13:45,154 --> 01:13:47,256
In any case, I have
shut off the keyboards.

1245
01:13:47,356 --> 01:13:49,425
There should be no
further disturbances.

1246
01:13:49,526 --> 01:13:50,827
Good luck.

1247
01:13:50,927 --> 01:13:53,262
And I'd like to apologize
for any little commotion

1248
01:13:53,362 --> 01:13:54,564
my machine may have caused.

1249
01:13:54,664 --> 01:13:55,499
Water under the bridge.

1250
01:13:55,599 --> 01:13:57,233
Bridges are obsolete.

1251
01:13:57,333 --> 01:13:58,167
Farewell.

1252
01:13:58,267 --> 01:13:59,068
Bye.

1253
