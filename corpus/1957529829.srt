Good evening, and allow
me to welcome each of you

00:01:05,449 --> 00:01:07,316
to the annual Night of the
Locusts.

[suspenseful music]

00:01:29,373 --> 00:01:33,041
Please take a moment to
introduce yourselves.

10
00:01:43,921 --> 00:01:46,490
I trust that you have
hydrated and remained

11
00:01:46,523 --> 00:01:48,590
physically and mentally ready.

12
00:01:57,868 --> 00:02:00,071
You will find the target
location

13
00:02:00,104 --> 00:02:03,772
for your run in your respective
packages.

14
00:02:13,751 --> 00:02:16,620
There will be two unwilling
players at the target address,

15
00:02:16,653 --> 00:02:18,754
one male and one female.

it was deactivated 87 days ago.

20
00:02:55,993 --> 00:02:58,062
Always remember your oath and
the laws

21
00:02:58,095 --> 00:02:59,661
that you've sworn to obey.

22
00:03:08,972 --> 00:03:11,776
Enjoy the evening, fellow
Locusts.

23
00:03:11,809 --> 00:03:13,644

Isn't this a surprise?

29
00:05:20,003 --> 00:05:22,006
How long are you here this time?

30
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,642
Honey, Liz just got into town.

31
00:05:24,675 --> 00:05:26,775
She's gonna stay with us for a
few days.

32
00:05:27,911 --> 00:05:29,079
Obviously.

33
00:05:29,112 --> 00:05:30,579
I did the math.

34
00:05:33,584 --> 00:05:34,716
How was work?

35
00:05:38,055 --> 00:05:39,790
I'm a mortgage bonder, Liz,

36
00:05:39,823 --> 00:05:42,724
Do you really want to know how
work was?

37
00:05:46,997 --> 00:05:48,098
Yeah, I didn't think so.

38
00:05:48,131 --> 00:05:49,598
Jess, a minute.

39
00:06:04,915 --> 00:06:07,067
What the fuck, Jess?

40
00:06:07,100 --> 00:06:09,253
She's had a brutal 48 hours.

41
00:06:09,286 --> 00:06:10,120
How long has she been here?

42
00:06:10,153 --> 00:06:11,738
Did you leave her alone?

43
00:06:11,771 --> 00:06:13,357
No, god dammit, she just got
here.

44
00:06:13,390 --> 00:06:16,291
She just got through telling
me what she's gone through.

45
00:06:18,028 --> 00:06:19,897
How could you let her back in
here?

46
00:06:19,930 --> 00:06:21,031
We agreed on this.

47
00:06:21,064 --> 00:06:23,867
That man laid his hands on
her.

48
00:06:23,900 --> 00:06:25,803
He is so much bigger
and stronger than her.

49
00:06:25,836 --> 00:06:27,137
He could have killed her.

50
00:06:27,170 --> 00:06:29,607
If her story's even true.

51
00:06:29,640 --> 00:06:31,609
She's a liar, Jessica!

52
00:06:31,642 --> 00:06:34,612
Last time she left him, we lent
her money

53
00:06:34,645 --> 00:06:36,614
to get back on her feet,
she fucking robbed us

54
00:06:36,647 --> 00:06:37,781
and ran right back to him.

55
00:06:37,814 --> 00:06:38,747

This is different.

58
00:06:43,053 --> 00:06:46,323
She really wants a new
beginning, okay?

59
00:06:46,356 --> 00:06:48,990
We are the only safe place she
has.

60
00:06:50,360 --> 00:06:52,060
How many more second chances?

61
00:06:53,063 --> 00:06:54,329
How many more this times?

62
00:06:59,369 --> 00:07:00,301
Hi, honey.

63
00:07:01,171 --> 00:07:04,274
Sorry, I was...

64
00:07:04,307 --> 00:07:07,277
Daniel, thank you for having me.

65
00:07:07,310 --> 00:07:11,115
I'll only be here a
little while, I promise.

66
00:07:11,148 --> 00:07:13,214
I know you've done a lot for me
already.

67
00:07:14,151 --> 00:07:15,684
We're happy you're here.

68
00:07:22,826 --> 00:07:24,359

00:08:02,966 --> 00:08:04,368
I can't deal with this.

71
00:08:04,401 --> 00:08:06,070
You have no idea.

72
00:08:06,103 --> 00:08:07,337
I have far more important
things to worry about it.

73
00:08:07,370 --> 00:08:08,939
I don't need this shit too.

74
00:08:08,972 --> 00:08:12,006

important than family?

this.

00:08:20,383 --> 00:08:21,416
Do better.

78
00:08:24,321 --> 00:08:26,190
Why don't you do something?

79
00:08:26,223 --> 00:08:29,026
All you do is spend my fucking
money.

you.

I bet.

87
00:09:36,493 --> 00:09:38,026
Been quite a day for you.

88
00:09:39,095 --> 00:09:40,595
How many of those have you had?

89
00:09:41,998 --> 00:09:43,097
This is my first.

90
00:09:44,935 --> 00:09:46,270
Hmm.

91
00:09:46,303 --> 00:09:47,471
I think you're a liar.

92
00:09:47,504 --> 00:09:53,811
I'd say you're about three
in, and you're a vodka man.

93
00:09:53,844 --> 00:09:54,978
Yes sir.

94
00:09:55,011 --> 00:09:56,546
How'd you know?

95
00:09:56,579 --> 00:09:58,115
We're not talking on
the telephone, Daniel.

96
00:09:58,148 --> 00:09:59,614
It's called video chat.

97
00:10:00,550 --> 00:10:02,019
I can see you.

98
00:10:02,052 --> 00:10:05,422
You know, I'm a scotch
man, myself, single malt.

99
00:10:05,455 --> 00:10:08,025
It's not too high brow and
not trash liquor either,

100
00:10:08,058 --> 00:10:09,924
but it gets the job done.

101
00:10:12,495 --> 00:10:14,462
Is there anything bothering you,
Daniel?

102
00:10:15,599 --> 00:10:17,866
Anything you want to get off
your chest?

103
00:10:19,402 --> 00:10:20,335
No.

104
00:10:22,038 --> 00:10:24,074
It's just this thing with
my wife and her sister,

105
00:10:24,107 --> 00:10:27,578
but don't worry, it'll be fine,
it won't distract from work.

106
00:10:27,611 --> 00:10:29,947
Oh, there's nothing more
important

107
00:10:29,980 --> 00:10:32,213
and more infuriating than
family.

108
00:10:34,384 --> 00:10:36,587
[Jess] And I don't even know a
Murray.

109
00:10:36,620 --> 00:10:39,857
Was that the name of your
fish in middle school?

110
00:10:39,890 --> 00:10:41,647
[Liz] I don't know.

111
00:10:41,680 --> 00:10:43,437
Well, anyway, that's what I've
been

112
00:10:43,470 --> 00:10:45,259
calling the mailman, and
his name is probably John.

113
00:10:46,062 --> 00:10:47,996
It's true, it's terrible.

114
00:10:52,535 --> 00:10:53,904
I've missed you!

115
00:10:53,937 --> 00:10:54,938
Oh.

116
00:10:54,971 --> 00:10:56,004
I'm so happy you're here!

117
00:10:57,040 --> 00:10:58,942
Okay, okay.

118
00:10:58,975 --> 00:11:00,308
Missed my Liz.

119
00:11:03,546 --> 00:11:04,948
Hmm.

120
00:11:04,981 --> 00:11:05,914
Wow.

121
00:11:07,017 --> 00:11:08,116
Look at all this.

122
00:11:11,354 --> 00:11:12,687
Look what you did, Jess.

123
00:11:16,092 --> 00:11:20,194
Well, it's not all what
it looks like all the time.

124
00:11:25,535 --> 00:11:27,101
How are things?

125
00:11:31,241 --> 00:11:32,240
I mean...

126
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:35,410
I don't know, I mean...

127
00:11:39,182 --> 00:11:41,249
It's been an emotional roller
coaster.

128
00:11:43,219 --> 00:11:44,319
Yeah, Daniel.

129
00:11:46,156 --> 00:11:50,325
I don't appreciate you running
out today.

130
00:11:51,494 --> 00:11:53,397
We were all waiting for a full
report

131
00:11:53,430 --> 00:11:54,996
on your interview, and...

132
00:11:57,100 --> 00:11:58,166
You disappeared.

133
00:12:00,370 --> 00:12:01,271
Yes, sir.

134
00:12:01,304 --> 00:12:02,572
Sorry about that.

135
00:12:02,605 --> 00:12:04,007
I needed to clear my head.

136
00:12:04,040 --> 00:12:05,406
Get home, recoup, you know?

137
00:12:07,010 --> 00:12:09,680
That interview was more an
interrogation.

138
00:12:09,713 --> 00:12:12,249
They tore into me.

139
00:12:12,282 --> 00:12:14,051
What exactly did you tell
them?

140
00:12:14,084 --> 00:12:15,018
Nothing.

141
00:12:15,051 --> 00:12:16,320
Nothing, sir, at all.

142
00:12:16,353 --> 00:12:18,555
Any questions they had
about the off-shores,

143
00:12:18,588 --> 00:12:20,306
I said I had no knowledge.

144
00:12:20,339 --> 00:12:22,059
Any questions about the board
meetings off the book, I said-

145
00:12:22,092 --> 00:12:23,691
- What meeting, hmm?

146
00:12:26,563 --> 00:12:28,465
Right, right, that's what I
said.

147
00:12:28,498 --> 00:12:29,749
What meetings?

148
00:12:29,782 --> 00:12:31,034
Our board members would
never hold meetings

149
00:12:31,067 --> 00:12:32,402
without some documentation or-

150
00:12:32,435 --> 00:12:33,368
- Daniel.

151
00:12:35,171 --> 00:12:37,975
Do I have to remind you
that if this continues,

152
00:12:38,008 --> 00:12:42,312
anything should become of
this pesky investigation,

153
00:12:42,345 --> 00:12:44,512
you're front and center in the
crosshairs.

154
00:12:46,649 --> 00:12:48,218
Yes, I understand, sir.

155
00:12:48,251 --> 00:12:52,122
And do you think that
your wife and her sister

156
00:12:52,155 --> 00:12:56,457
would like this piled on top
of their melodramatic baggage?

157
00:12:58,628 --> 00:12:59,563
I don't think so.

158
00:12:59,596 --> 00:13:02,666
His mood swings, I just,
something big

159
00:13:02,699 --> 00:13:04,334
must be going on at work.

160
00:13:04,367 --> 00:13:05,702
I don't know, he doesn't
talk to me about it.

161
00:13:05,735 --> 00:13:07,738
He just comes home and boozes.

162
00:13:07,771 --> 00:13:10,571
He gets boozy, Liz, it's not
hot.

163
00:13:13,676 --> 00:13:15,746
I promise I won't be here very
long.

164
00:13:15,779 --> 00:13:19,683
I've been looking at some
inpatient-outpatient rehabs,

165
00:13:19,716 --> 00:13:21,551
and this time I'm really
gonna stick to it.

166
00:13:21,584 --> 00:13:25,589
I promise I have some Suboxone,
so I won't get symptoms,

167
00:13:25,622 --> 00:13:29,159
and it's just temporary.

168
00:13:29,192 --> 00:13:30,060
I know.

169
00:13:30,093 --> 00:13:34,664
Look, it's not just Daniel's
house, it's my house too,

170
00:13:34,697 --> 00:13:36,731
and you can stay as long as you
want.

171
00:13:39,169 --> 00:13:40,234
Thank you.

172
00:13:54,717 --> 00:13:56,084
[Jess] Is that Jake?

173
00:13:58,088 --> 00:13:58,789
Yeah.

174
00:13:58,822 --> 00:13:59,821
What's he saying?

175
00:14:02,158 --> 00:14:05,062
"Please, I just want to talk.

176
00:14:05,095 --> 00:14:06,294
I'm really sorry.

177
00:14:07,263 --> 00:14:08,398
I love you."

178
00:14:08,431 --> 00:14:09,699
Give me the phone.

179
00:14:09,732 --> 00:14:12,069
Do not respond to that psycho.

180
00:14:12,102 --> 00:14:13,468
I'm not gonna respond.

181
00:14:15,271 --> 00:14:17,340
Don't take my phone away, Mom.

182
00:14:17,373 --> 00:14:18,542

All right guys, we got what we
came for.

734
01:06:40,513 --> 01:06:42,981
[tense music]

735
01:07:04,604 --> 01:07:06,840
Now at this time,
affirm to your brothers

736
01:07:06,873 --> 01:07:09,509
by raising your right
hand that you are tonight

737
01:07:09,542 --> 01:07:11,945
forever abiding by your oath.

738
01:07:11,978 --> 01:07:14,715
You are not in possession of any
firearms

739
01:07:14,748 --> 01:07:17,818
and you are free from any
communication devices.

740
01:07:17,851 --> 01:07:19,886
That the only time peace will be
held

741
01:07:19,919 --> 01:07:21,922
by the evening's timekeeper.

742
01:07:21,955 --> 01:07:24,691
Always remember your oath and
the laws

743
01:07:24,724 --> 01:07:26,627
that you have sworn to obey.

744
01:07:26,660 --> 01:07:29,630
If those oaths are broken, your
brothers

745
01:07:29,663 --> 01:07:31,529
will protect their own oaths.

746
01:07:32,599 --> 01:07:35,066
[tense music]

747
01:07:49,382 --> 01:07:51,849
[door closes]

748
01:08:17,110 --> 01:08:18,879
Don't come out.

749
01:08:18,912 --> 01:08:20,044
Wait, please.

750
01:08:26,953 --> 01:08:29,022
There's somebody
upstairs, under the bed!

751
01:08:29,055 --> 01:08:31,725
There's somebody upstairs, an
unknown.

752
01:08:31,758 --> 01:08:32,893
I'm serious!

753
01:08:32,926 --> 01:08:34,525
She's gonna ruin everything.

754
01:08:47,374 --> 01:08:48,742
You fucking guys.

755
01:08:48,775 --> 01:08:51,376
The one time I'm fuckin'
telling you the truth!

756
01:08:56,616 --> 01:08:57,949
Don't, please.

757
01:09:08,161 --> 01:09:10,928
[ominous music]

758
01:09:14,701 --> 01:09:15,767
Go on, go!

759
01:09:16,603 --> 01:09:17,838
Upstairs under the bed!

760
01:09:17,871 --> 01:09:18,939
Fuck...

761
01:09:18,972 --> 01:09:21,906
[Nixon murmuring]

762
01:09:29,716 --> 01:09:32,650
[Nixon murmuring]

763
01:09:41,194 --> 01:09:43,928
[Liz shouting]

764
01:09:44,898 --> 01:09:45,830
No!

765
01:10:00,013 --> 01:10:01,615
Hey!

766
01:10:01,648 --> 01:10:02,580
Hey!

767
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:08,453
Hey!

768
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:23,801
[tense music]

769
01:10:38,218 --> 01:10:41,018
[Jess wheezing]

770
01:10:54,901 --> 01:10:57,502
You got the unknown, right?

771
01:11:19,259 --> 01:11:20,892
She went downstairs.

772
01:11:23,997 --> 01:11:26,664
[tense music]

773
01:11:28,902 --> 01:11:30,504
Now, for your selected level,

774
01:11:30,537 --> 01:11:32,239
there is no security system in
place.

775
01:11:32,272 --> 01:11:35,141
It was deactivated 87 days ago.

776
01:11:35,174 --> 01:11:41,014
The gate security code is
six-five-six-five-seven.

777
01:11:41,047 --> 01:11:44,150
However, you are encouraged
not to use that as an entrance,

778
01:11:44,183 --> 01:11:46,953
the gate could be deactivated by
using

779
01:11:46,986 --> 01:11:48,855
the same code when prompted.

780
01:11:48,888 --> 01:11:53,260
Per your selected level, there
will be two unwilling players

781
01:11:53,293 --> 01:11:56,594
at the target address,
one male and one female.

782
01:11:57,764 --> 01:12:00,197
Timekeeper, start your clock.

783
01:12:01,601 --> 01:12:03,801
You have 180 minutes, no more.

784
01:12:06,005 --> 01:12:08,642
[man singing indistinctly]

785
01:12:08,675 --> 01:12:10,310
[clock ticking]

786
01:12:10,343 --> 01:12:12,779
[clock stops]

787
01:12:12,812 --> 01:12:13,744
Time.

788
01:12:20,253 --> 01:12:22,756
Now, you have been
given your assignments,

789
01:12:22,789 --> 01:12:25,825
and each of you know the pledge
binding you to this evening.

790
01:12:25,858 --> 01:12:29,296
As always, we appreciate your
membership

791
01:12:29,329 --> 01:12:31,998
and your generous
donations over the years.

792
01:12:32,031 --> 01:12:35,035
It gives us great pleasure to
facilitate

793
01:12:35,068 --> 01:12:36,801
this evening for all of you.

794
01:12:38,071 --> 01:12:41,741
Just remember, protect
yourselves, but above all,

795
01:12:41,774 --> 01:12:45,710
protect all Locusts by
first protecting the run,

796
01:12:47,113 --> 01:12:49,747
and you will be protecting
all future runs.

797
01:12:50,950 --> 01:12:53,250
Enjoy the evening, fellow
Locusts.

798
01:12:54,320 --> 01:12:55,353
And God bless.

799
01:13:00,760 --> 01:13:01,695
Woo!

800
01:13:01,728 --> 01:13:02,660
Yeah.

801
01:13:10,136 --> 01:13:13,404
[train signal dinging]

802
01:13:15,141 --> 01:13:18,712
[suspenseful music]

803
01:13:18,745 --> 01:13:21,679
[Nixon murmuring]

804
01:13:24,117 --> 01:13:25,752
Come on, you can't leave me
here!

805
01:13:25,785 --> 01:13:27,020
I'll be fine.

806
01:13:27,053 --> 01:13:27,954
Please.

807
01:13:27,987 --> 01:13:29,923
[indistinct] I'll be good.

808
01:13:29,956 --> 01:13:31,891
Come on, please.

809
01:13:31,924 --> 01:13:32,926
Come on.

810
01:13:32,959 --> 01:13:34,291
Come on, please.

811
01:13:39,098 --> 01:13:40,898
No, no, don't leave!

812
01:13:42,035 --> 01:13:44,969
[Nixon murmuring]

813
01:13:45,872 --> 01:13:46,871
Please, no!

814
01:13:52,311 --> 01:13:54,979
[tense music]

815
01:14:11,064 --> 01:14:12,463
Cutting it close, Locusts.

816
01:14:20,173 --> 01:14:21,205
Elimination report.

817
01:14:26,446 --> 01:14:29,180
[solemn music]

818
01:14:36,923 --> 01:14:39,323
[Liz crying]

819
01:14:42,095 --> 01:14:43,160
I'm sorry.

820
01:14:52,271 --> 01:14:55,940
Two targets, one visitor,
eliminated.

821
01:14:59,912 --> 01:15:01,946
And an unknown in the upstairs
closet.

822
01:15:03,116 --> 01:15:04,751
Eliminated?

823
01:15:04,784 --> 01:15:05,916
Clock ran out.

824
01:15:07,887 --> 01:15:08,955
You guys are killing me.

825
01:15:08,988 --> 01:15:11,057
Run intel was bullshit.

826
01:15:11,090 --> 01:15:13,993
- A visitor, an unknown-
- I got it, I got it.

827
01:15:14,026 --> 01:15:17,030
- And your rogue?
- Inside.

828
01:15:17,063 --> 01:15:18,898
Law followed.

829
01:15:18,931 --> 01:15:21,065
His first and last run.

830
01:15:24,370 --> 01:15:26,005
Let's hope you guys
didn't come up with seven

831
01:15:26,038 --> 01:15:27,140
in the oh fuck slots.

832
01:15:27,173 --> 01:15:30,510
Between you and me,
there were five unmarkeds

833
01:15:30,543 --> 01:15:33,113
on first runs tonight.

834
01:15:33,146 --> 01:15:36,247
The One's grandson was
on one of those runs.

835
01:15:40,486 --> 01:15:42,386
She's all gassed up and ready to
go.

836
01:15:43,389 --> 01:15:46,893
I know it's chilly, but shed
those

837
01:15:46,926 --> 01:15:48,261
and don't forget the gloves.

838
01:15:48,294 --> 01:15:51,962
I've got clean and pure
clothes here ready for wear.

839
01:15:53,299 --> 01:15:55,535
You guys have a good 365.

840
01:15:55,568 --> 01:15:56,834
I've got work to do.

841
01:16:00,173 --> 01:16:01,941
Extra work, thanks to you guys.

842
01:16:01,974 --> 01:16:03,276
Did you not hear us?

843
01:16:03,309 --> 01:16:05,876
- The intel was-
- Yeah, yeah.

844
01:16:15,922 --> 01:16:18,389
[tense music]

845
01:16:23,329 --> 01:16:24,261
Fuck.

846
01:16:35,007 --> 01:16:35,940
Bad run.

847
01:16:42,281 --> 01:16:43,550
Hey.

848
01:16:43,583 --> 01:16:44,515
What happened?

849
01:16:45,551 --> 01:16:47,220
- Who are you?
- Are you okay?

850
01:16:47,253 --> 01:16:48,822
Don't come any closer.

851
01:16:48,855 --> 01:16:50,256
I'm with the gas company.

852
01:16:50,289 --> 01:16:52,025
There's been all kinds of crazy
stuff.

853
01:16:52,058 --> 01:16:53,493
- What happened to the-
- What are you doing here?

854
01:16:53,526 --> 01:16:55,361
The neighbor smelled gas
and called the gas company,

855
01:16:55,394 --> 01:16:56,429
but what the hell's going on
here?

856
01:16:56,462 --> 01:16:57,297
No no, don't come any closer!

857
01:16:57,330 --> 01:16:58,298
I'm here to help you.

858
01:16:58,331 --> 01:16:59,566
Are you okay?

859
01:16:59,599 --> 01:17:01,267
Stay back, stay back!

860
01:17:01,300 --> 01:17:02,969

you, I'm here to help you.

What happened?

863
01:17:06,339 --> 01:17:07,271
Are you okay?

864
01:17:08,241 --> 01:17:09,209
She's dead.

865
01:17:09,242 --> 01:17:10,476
Who's dead?

866
01:17:10,509 --> 01:17:11,511
Tell me what happened.

[Liz crying]

868
01:17:12,411 --> 01:17:14,214
Tell me about it.

Let me help you.

870
01:17:15,581 --> 01:17:17,314
Tell me, what happened, sweetie?

871
01:17:18,117 --> 01:17:19,085
What happened?

872
01:17:19,118 --> 01:17:22,052
[Liz sobbing]
Shh.

873
01:17:25,057 --> 01:17:25,990
It's okay.
