1
00:00:09,030 --> 00:00:11,360
[Girl on TV]
You need to talk to your dad.

2
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:13,030
Ow!

3
00:00:13,070 --> 00:00:15,070
Okay. Okay.

4
00:00:15,100 --> 00:00:17,100
He's not an ogre, ass!

5
00:00:17,140 --> 00:00:20,910
[Girl #2 on TV]
Gee! All right.
I'll talk to him tonight.

6
00:00:20,940 --> 00:00:22,880
Wow.

7
00:00:22,910 --> 00:00:28,150
That's, like, my favorite
right shoulder, ever, I think.

8
00:00:28,180 --> 00:00:30,380
Oh, my God!
It is.

9
00:00:30,420 --> 00:00:32,320
Are you, like, 13?

10
00:00:32,350 --> 00:00:34,790
That's not gonna work.
And besides,

11
00:00:34,820 --> 00:00:36,760
John's gonna be down here
any moment.

12
00:00:36,790 --> 00:00:39,960
No. No, he's not.
We have at least 20 minutes.

13
00:00:39,990 --> 00:00:41,900
I work with the guy.
I've seen it firsthand.

14
00:00:41,930 --> 00:00:44,870
He's one of those clean-freak,
bathroom-phobic types
who take forever.

15
00:00:44,900 --> 00:00:47,730
And even if he didn't,
we're newlyweds, right?

16
00:00:47,770 --> 00:00:50,000
He'll understand.

17
00:00:50,040 --> 00:00:53,170
Still, clean-freak or not,
I hardly want to be the topic

18
00:00:53,210 --> 00:00:55,510
of workplace conversation.

19
00:00:55,540 --> 00:00:58,410
Cubicle conversation
can only go so far.

20
00:00:58,440 --> 00:01:01,150
[toilet flushes]

21
00:01:01,180 --> 00:01:03,280
I win.
[door opens]

22
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:09,460
John, John, John,
did I mention you'll be, um,

23
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:11,420
paying for dinner?

24
00:01:13,890 --> 00:01:15,330
[keypad beeping]

25
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,760
[alarm beeping]

26
00:01:16,800 --> 00:01:18,400
[Woman]
Don't beep at me,
you stupid alarm.

27
00:01:18,430 --> 00:01:20,800
The doors are locked.

28
00:01:20,830 --> 00:01:23,840
Well, babe, will you
go check all the doors?

29
00:01:23,870 --> 00:01:27,470
Please, please, please,
please, please?

30
00:01:32,980 --> 00:01:35,520
[lock clicking]

31
00:01:45,990 --> 00:01:50,260
[chattering]
I know where the key is.

32
00:02:13,490 --> 00:02:17,190
[sweater rips]
Oh! Oh, shoot!

33
00:02:17,220 --> 00:02:22,300
Marge, you don't happen to have
your knitting needles with you,
do you?

34
00:02:22,330 --> 00:02:25,170
[indistinct]
I gave up making

35
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:28,100
and started buying
for that very reason.

36
00:02:28,130 --> 00:02:30,400
Oh, once one thread rips,
the rest will follow.

37
00:02:30,440 --> 00:02:32,170
I just know it.

38
00:02:32,210 --> 00:02:35,180
Why don't you go out
and buy a new sweater
so that doesn't happen?

39
00:02:35,210 --> 00:02:36,610
Buy one?

40
00:02:36,640 --> 00:02:38,280
We don't get paid
till next week,

41
00:02:38,310 --> 00:02:41,350
and my Social Security
don't cover more

42
00:02:41,380 --> 00:02:42,920
than the pantyhose
on my ass.

43
00:02:42,950 --> 00:02:46,250
Bertha, you said
the A-double-S word
in the library.

44
00:02:46,290 --> 00:02:48,020
What's the matter, Marge?

45
00:02:48,050 --> 00:02:49,960
I say a lot of things
in the library

46
00:02:49,990 --> 00:02:52,230
you don't know about.
[laughing]

47
00:02:52,260 --> 00:02:55,630
Next week.
I can't believe I forgot that.

48
00:02:55,660 --> 00:02:58,600
Why, honey,
you need some money?

49
00:03:00,200 --> 00:03:02,840
No. I just didn't
want you to worry.

50
00:03:07,210 --> 00:03:09,510
After these,
you can go.

51
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,980
Why are you always so sad?

52
00:03:46,210 --> 00:03:48,980
[Girl]
You know,
it isn't polite to stare.

53
00:03:49,020 --> 00:03:51,050
Uh, I wasn't staring.

54
00:03:51,080 --> 00:03:52,520
Oh, really?

55
00:03:52,550 --> 00:03:55,420
Then what the fuck
was that thing you were
just doing with your eyes?

56
00:03:55,460 --> 00:03:58,020
You know, that thing where
you wouldn't take them off

57
00:03:58,060 --> 00:03:59,460
those two comatose-looking
people over there?

58
00:03:59,490 --> 00:04:02,660
That's right. Staring.
And it isn't polite.

59
00:04:02,700 --> 00:04:05,170
Especially when they might
be trying to steal something.

60
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:06,970
[gasps]

61
00:04:07,000 --> 00:04:08,030
[laughing]

62
00:04:10,070 --> 00:04:11,500
[blows raspberry]

63
00:04:33,590 --> 00:04:36,000
[Man]
Hungry for a Papa-Go
Park Picnic Meal?

64
00:04:38,630 --> 00:04:41,430
How much?
Five bucks.

65
00:04:43,240 --> 00:04:45,040
How much for
just the hot dog?

66
00:04:45,070 --> 00:04:46,940
Three bucks.
Hmm.

67
00:05:22,780 --> 00:05:25,650
What, the library now sends
its stupid little shelf-stuffers

68
00:05:25,680 --> 00:05:27,710
to get stolen books back?

69
00:05:29,180 --> 00:05:30,420
No.

70
00:05:32,450 --> 00:05:34,090
What?

71
00:05:36,060 --> 00:05:38,720
[mutters]

72
00:05:38,760 --> 00:05:40,760
I--

73
00:05:40,790 --> 00:05:42,730
I just followed you.

74
00:05:45,170 --> 00:05:47,170
What the fuck?
Are you a pervert?

75
00:05:51,300 --> 00:05:53,210
Are you gonna tell my boss?

76
00:05:53,240 --> 00:05:57,040
No. Not if you tell me
why you followed me,

77
00:05:57,080 --> 00:05:59,180
Alex.

78
00:05:59,210 --> 00:06:02,050
How do you know my name?

79
00:06:04,550 --> 00:06:06,690
After you buy something--

80
00:06:06,720 --> 00:06:08,290
ugh--

81
00:06:08,320 --> 00:06:10,520
make sure it's securely
back in your pocket.

82
00:06:10,560 --> 00:06:12,430
Leave it out like you did,
it's easy to steal.

83
00:06:19,230 --> 00:06:20,770
So?

84
00:06:23,270 --> 00:06:25,170
[Alex]
Don't you look at her

85
00:06:25,210 --> 00:06:27,340
and want to know why
she's like that?

86
00:06:27,370 --> 00:06:30,340
Why she's close
to that dog, but...

87
00:06:33,180 --> 00:06:34,150
recoils from people

88
00:06:34,180 --> 00:06:37,120
like they're the ones
who are going to bite?

89
00:06:38,320 --> 00:06:40,290
Is he really that cool,

90
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:44,060
or is it an act?

91
00:06:47,130 --> 00:06:49,200
If it's an act, why?

92
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:54,100
Or this couple in the library--
the Smiths.

93
00:06:54,130 --> 00:06:56,100
They have this routine.

94
00:06:56,140 --> 00:06:57,840
They come in every month

95
00:06:57,870 --> 00:07:00,210
and check out
the same book.

96
00:07:00,240 --> 00:07:03,210
And every time they come in,
they're sad.

97
00:07:03,240 --> 00:07:05,150
Why?

98
00:07:05,180 --> 00:07:07,880
You know,
when I was a little girl,

99
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:10,180
I used to have a cat.

100
00:07:10,220 --> 00:07:12,220
What happened to it?

101
00:07:12,250 --> 00:07:13,890
Um...

102
00:07:13,920 --> 00:07:16,160
curiosity ran it over.
[chuckles]

103
00:07:16,190 --> 00:07:18,720
Blood and guts were everywhere.
It was really disgusting,
actually.

104
00:07:20,890 --> 00:07:23,230
I-- I have to go.

105
00:07:25,730 --> 00:07:28,430
Okay. I'll just
follow you, then.

106
00:07:29,640 --> 00:07:31,570
[chuckles]

107
00:07:41,180 --> 00:07:43,250
I'm sorry.

108
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,690
Didn't mean to mess up
your nice shit.

109
00:07:48,290 --> 00:07:51,660
Well, if you ever need
a hot girl for a roommate,
just let me know.

110
00:07:51,690 --> 00:07:54,890
I'll move right in.

111
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,900
Where's the fam?

112
00:07:57,960 --> 00:07:59,870
Why'd you steal
the book?

113
00:07:59,900 --> 00:08:02,200
You didn't tell me.

114
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,600
[chuckles]
Well, that wasn't
part of the deal,

115
00:08:04,640 --> 00:08:08,210
but, um, 'cause of my dad.

116
00:08:08,240 --> 00:08:10,480
To win an argument
I had with him.

117
00:08:10,510 --> 00:08:12,410
He's one of those doctors
who refuses to believe

118
00:08:12,450 --> 00:08:14,410
people are actually
how they want to be.

119
00:08:14,450 --> 00:08:17,180
Yeah, shit happens
that fucks them up, but...
I don't know.

120
00:08:17,220 --> 00:08:19,190
Either they wanna get better
or they don't.
It's their choice.

121
00:08:19,220 --> 00:08:20,920
But when they get
with people like him,

122
00:08:20,950 --> 00:08:23,190
it doesn't happen.
Why?

123
00:08:23,220 --> 00:08:25,360
'Cause now they're hooked
on stupid gimmicks.

124
00:08:25,390 --> 00:08:28,430
Told to find out what their
real problem is when they
knew it in the first place.

125
00:08:28,460 --> 00:08:30,400
They just couldn't
fucking face it.

126
00:08:30,430 --> 00:08:31,860
Now they're looking
for different solutions.

127
00:08:31,900 --> 00:08:33,900
Shit that isn't possible,
but, um,

128
00:08:33,930 --> 00:08:36,940
'cause of people like him,
they're convinced it is.

129
00:08:36,970 --> 00:08:39,310
That's why you steal books?

130
00:08:39,340 --> 00:08:41,270
I steal whatever.

131
00:08:41,310 --> 00:08:42,880
I figured since I was
his daughter

132
00:08:42,910 --> 00:08:44,510
and so clearly fine,

133
00:08:44,540 --> 00:08:46,510
he would have to know
there's no bigger issue.

134
00:08:46,550 --> 00:08:47,980
So what happened?

135
00:08:48,010 --> 00:08:51,350
Now I'm addicted
to stealing shit.

136
00:08:51,380 --> 00:08:53,420
But whatever. Who cares?

137
00:08:53,450 --> 00:08:56,990
I won...I think.

138
00:08:57,020 --> 00:08:58,320
Well, I wouldn't
have known that

139
00:08:58,360 --> 00:08:59,830
if I hadn't followed you.

140
00:09:13,540 --> 00:09:15,640
[Alex]
Why are they back the next day?

141
00:09:17,310 --> 00:09:20,410
Oh, my. You really
like this one, huh?

142
00:09:20,450 --> 00:09:22,550
I can probably
special order it if you like.

143
00:09:22,580 --> 00:09:24,880
No. We like
to come and get it.

144
00:09:24,920 --> 00:09:26,820
It gets us
out of the house.

145
00:09:26,850 --> 00:09:29,620
[Mr. Smith]
Actually, this will be
the last time we check it out.

146
00:09:29,660 --> 00:09:32,860
I think we've finally
had our fill.

147
00:09:32,890 --> 00:09:34,730
Right, honey?

148
00:09:42,900 --> 00:09:44,000
[footsteps approaching]

149
00:09:44,040 --> 00:09:47,040
[Mr. Smith]
Where are you going?
Shh.

150
00:09:47,070 --> 00:09:48,870
What's wrong?

151
00:09:50,340 --> 00:09:52,750
Honey?
Nothing.

152
00:09:54,350 --> 00:09:56,320
Thank you.
[Bertha]
You're welcome.

153
00:09:56,350 --> 00:09:59,520
[Mr. Smith]
Have a good day.
You, too. Bye.

154
00:11:09,420 --> 00:11:11,090
Breathe, Alice, breathe.

155
00:11:14,730 --> 00:11:17,460
It's been a year.

156
00:11:17,500 --> 00:11:19,600
You have to try.

157
00:11:21,770 --> 00:11:23,640
You can't keep doing this.

158
00:11:24,700 --> 00:11:26,640
[sniffles]

159
00:12:03,610 --> 00:12:05,580
[gasps]

160
00:12:05,610 --> 00:12:08,950
[Mr. Smith]
What? What's going on?

161
00:12:08,980 --> 00:12:10,950
Honey, what's wrong?

162
00:12:10,980 --> 00:12:13,590
Are you okay?

163
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:16,920
Honey, what?
What happened?

164
00:12:45,150 --> 00:12:47,520
[Mrs. Smith]
I thought I saw him.

165
00:12:49,150 --> 00:12:51,520
[Mr. Smith]
It will stop, honey.
You know it will.

166
00:12:51,560 --> 00:12:53,590
When?

167
00:12:53,630 --> 00:12:57,730
We have taken a big step
this week, and the rest
will follow.

168
00:12:57,760 --> 00:13:00,730
By packing him away
like one of your sports cards?

169
00:13:00,770 --> 00:13:03,040
By erasing any evidence
that he was ever here?

170
00:13:03,070 --> 00:13:05,870
That is not a first step.
Then what is?

171
00:13:05,910 --> 00:13:08,070
You tell me.
What is a first step, Alice?

172
00:13:08,110 --> 00:13:09,580
Because I would really
like to know.

173
00:13:09,610 --> 00:13:12,080
Doing nothing?
Never changing?

174
00:13:12,110 --> 00:13:14,010
I didn't say that.
Well, then, what--

175
00:13:14,050 --> 00:13:15,950

It's hard.
You don't understand.

178

I'll tell you what
I don't understand, Alice.

179

I don't understand
why you keep going in there.

again and again.

182

I don't understand why you
keep torturing yourself...
No! No!

Yes! Yes! Yes!
No, you cannot touch the...

184

No! You have your
stupid office closet.

what you do in there?

187
00:13:43,540 --> 00:13:47,250
Why you miss your deadlines?
Hey, at least I'm still working.

188
00:13:47,280 --> 00:13:49,150
Oh, that's right.

189
00:13:49,180 --> 00:13:52,280

shop's gonna solve everything,
isn't it?

190
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:54,620

as you want.

197

There's a week's worth
in the fridge.

198
00:14:16,910 --> 00:14:18,780
Why didn't you call
the police?

199
00:14:20,580 --> 00:14:22,650
You reminded me of my son.

200
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,650
Oh, yeah?

201
00:14:25,690 --> 00:14:28,620
How old is he?
Is he home?

202
00:14:31,260 --> 00:14:33,660
He's dead.

203
00:14:37,130 --> 00:14:39,900
It was a terrible disease.

204

Your parents are dead,
too, aren't they?

205
00:14:50,940 --> 00:14:53,910
I can see it in your eyes.

206
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:01,290
I have to go.

207
00:15:03,120 --> 00:15:07,630
Thanks for the food
and for not calling the cops.

208

I don't know
how this happened.

209
00:15:10,700 --> 00:15:12,600
It looked like my house
from outside.

210
00:15:12,630 --> 00:15:14,200
Would you like
to see his picture?

211
00:15:17,770 --> 00:15:21,240
This is Timmy
before he got sick.

212
00:15:21,270 --> 00:15:23,940
Uh, he was 16 there.

213
00:15:31,650 --> 00:15:35,590
He was actually much bigger
than he looks in that photo.

Oh, I'm sorry.

I'm supposed to watch
my Dr. Alred videos now.

Is that okay?

218

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Hello, and welcome back.

221
00:16:00,750 --> 00:16:02,950
I hope you've seen
some progress within yourself

222
00:16:02,980 --> 00:16:04,250
since last we spoke.

223
00:16:04,280 --> 00:16:07,790
If so, you're one step further
in this terrible journey

224
00:16:07,820 --> 00:16:09,890
known as
the five stages of grief.

225
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:12,390
And what one are we on?

226
00:16:12,420 --> 00:16:14,690
Depression.

227
00:16:14,730 --> 00:16:17,200
I want you to think
about your loved one

228
00:16:17,230 --> 00:16:20,170
and recall one happy memory.

229
00:16:20,200 --> 00:16:22,740
But don't get sad
about what isn't.

230
00:16:22,770 --> 00:16:27,740
Instead, celebrate what was
and cherish that.

231
00:16:27,770 --> 00:16:31,780
If you can do this,
then you are ready.

232
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:35,110
But if you can't, then you
need to restart this disc

233
00:16:35,150 --> 00:16:38,350
and reflect on exactly
why you're feeling

234
00:16:38,380 --> 00:16:40,790
the way you are.

235
00:16:42,050 --> 00:16:45,120
Which one, honey? There are
so many to choose from.

236
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:47,090
It's up to you.

237
00:16:49,390 --> 00:16:51,860
Ah. I got it.
The perfect one.

238
00:16:51,900 --> 00:16:54,770
This will tell you the kind of
crazy imagination Timmy had.

239
00:16:54,800 --> 00:16:57,100
He was, uh--
He was about eight,

240
00:16:57,140 --> 00:16:58,500
and he had just gotten home
from a sleepover

241
00:16:58,540 --> 00:17:01,970
where they had stayed
up all night watching
scary movies, and--

242
00:17:02,010 --> 00:17:03,880
Not this one.

243
00:17:05,780 --> 00:17:08,050
But it's a good one.
Please?

244
00:17:09,950 --> 00:17:11,320
Do what you want.

245
00:17:14,950 --> 00:17:16,820
[door closes]

246
00:17:18,420 --> 00:17:20,390
He, um--

247
00:17:20,430 --> 00:17:24,830
He acts like he doesn't like
to talk about Timmy, but...

248
00:17:24,860 --> 00:17:27,200
I know what he does
in his office.

249
00:17:31,000 --> 00:17:33,210
What was the movie?

250
00:17:33,240 --> 00:17:35,170
Well, it was, uh...

251
00:17:35,210 --> 00:17:37,740
It was one of those
monster ones.

252
00:17:37,780 --> 00:17:40,880
You know,
where they steal you away,
take over your body.

253
00:17:40,910 --> 00:17:42,820
I can't remember.
Something like that.

254
00:17:42,850 --> 00:17:46,950
But what I do remember
was the look on his face.

255
00:17:48,020 --> 00:17:50,860
He was so scared
that his little eyes

256
00:17:50,890 --> 00:17:54,390
trembled as he watched me
in the garden.

257
00:17:54,430 --> 00:17:56,460
Finally, he said, "Mommy,

258
00:17:56,500 --> 00:18:00,800
are the monsters gonna come
and take me away?"

259
00:18:00,830 --> 00:18:04,500
And I said, "Sweetheart,
if they exist, no,
they're not gonna do that."

260
00:18:04,540 --> 00:18:07,970
But Timmy, always more
concerned with others,

261
00:18:08,010 --> 00:18:09,910
he said, "Well, if they do,
don't worry,

262
00:18:09,940 --> 00:18:12,040
"'cause I'll come back
just like in the movie.

263
00:18:12,080 --> 00:18:13,450
"But I probably won't
remember you,

264
00:18:13,480 --> 00:18:15,450
"because nobody in the movie
ever remembered anything.

265
00:18:15,480 --> 00:18:17,520
That's just
the way it works."

266
00:18:19,020 --> 00:18:21,820
And I told him that
it would be okay if he didn't,

267
00:18:21,850 --> 00:18:26,790
because we would always
remember him.

[Dr. Alred on TV]
Did you pass?

If so, before you move on
to "acceptance,"

270
00:18:37,840 --> 00:18:40,540
you need to select a hobby
that will help occupy you

349
00:24:19,740 --> 00:24:21,880
You've been asleep
for two days.

350
00:24:21,910 --> 00:24:25,180
You're gonna be
a little tender for a while.

351
00:24:25,220 --> 00:24:28,690
The car that hit you got away,
but lucky for you,
we were right there.

352
00:24:32,690 --> 00:24:34,760
What's wrong with me?

353
00:24:34,790 --> 00:24:36,700
When the car
slammed into you,

354
00:24:36,730 --> 00:24:38,800
it hit your legs.

355
00:24:38,830 --> 00:24:42,530
By the time we got to you,
your knees were already swollen.

356
00:24:42,570 --> 00:24:45,340
We did the best we could,
but we're not gonna know
if they're broken

357
00:24:45,370 --> 00:24:47,340
until the swelling
goes down.

358
00:24:49,240 --> 00:24:51,880
Am I in the hospital?
No.

359
00:24:51,910 --> 00:24:54,850
We're gonna
take care of you.

360
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,750
We-We've done it before.

361
00:24:57,780 --> 00:24:59,550
For Timmy.

362
00:25:00,990 --> 00:25:03,190
He, um...

363
00:25:03,220 --> 00:25:05,820
He had osteoporosis.
Do you know what that is?

364
00:25:07,290 --> 00:25:09,560
Never mind.
Of course you do.

365
00:25:09,590 --> 00:25:11,860
You're a smarty-pants.

366
00:25:12,930 --> 00:25:14,400
It was, um--

367
00:25:14,430 --> 00:25:16,800
It was a rare case.

368
00:25:16,840 --> 00:25:19,770
No one caught it
until it was too late.

369
00:25:19,800 --> 00:25:21,340
He, um--

370
00:25:21,370 --> 00:25:24,280
He fell on the field.

371
00:25:24,310 --> 00:25:29,350
His legs buckled back,
one under the other.

372
00:25:29,380 --> 00:25:31,820
And afterwards,
he couldn't walk,
much like you,

373
00:25:31,850 --> 00:25:33,920
but his bones never healed.

374
00:25:33,950 --> 00:25:35,920
They were too ravaged

375
00:25:35,950 --> 00:25:38,360
all through his body.

376
00:25:38,390 --> 00:25:40,690
After he was bedridden,

377
00:25:40,730 --> 00:25:45,430
the rest of his diseased bones
just wasted away...

378
00:25:45,460 --> 00:25:48,730
until it became too--

379
00:25:48,770 --> 00:25:51,300
too dangerous to put...

380
00:25:51,340 --> 00:25:53,540
weight on any one bone.

381
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:59,310
So we learned
to take care of him until...

382
00:26:04,950 --> 00:26:07,420
We took care of him...

383
00:26:07,450 --> 00:26:10,360
just like we're gonna
take care of you.

384
00:26:14,330 --> 00:26:17,400
You rest, okay?

385
00:26:17,430 --> 00:26:19,830
He can't stay here.

386
00:26:19,860 --> 00:26:21,900
He has no one else,
remember?

387
00:26:21,930 --> 00:26:24,670
We can take him to the hospital
like I wanted to two days ago.

388
00:26:24,700 --> 00:26:28,010
Mark, he has no money,
no health insurance,

389
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:30,340
and no one
to take care of him.

390
00:26:30,380 --> 00:26:33,450
We can.
We can help.

391
00:26:33,480 --> 00:26:34,610
No,

392
00:26:34,650 --> 00:26:36,280
we can't.

393
00:26:36,320 --> 00:26:38,320
Yes, we can.

394
00:26:38,350 --> 00:26:40,420
We've been given
a second chance.

395
00:26:40,450 --> 00:26:43,790
To do what?
To do things right.

396
00:26:43,820 --> 00:26:46,690
To not screw it up
like we did before.

397
00:26:48,430 --> 00:26:49,790
We beat ourselves up
every day

398
00:26:49,830 --> 00:26:51,400
over what we would've
done differently.

399
00:26:51,430 --> 00:26:53,530
Now we don't have to.

400
00:26:55,400 --> 00:26:57,900
I'm sorry
you can't see that.

401
00:27:11,750 --> 00:27:13,890
[door opens]

402
00:27:19,920 --> 00:27:22,560
Has the swelling
gone down?

403
00:27:22,590 --> 00:27:24,560
Not much. No.

404
00:27:26,000 --> 00:27:30,030
Dad? Mom?

405
00:27:30,070 --> 00:27:32,440
It's okay. We're right here.
What do you need, sweetie?

406
00:27:37,110 --> 00:27:39,780
I don't need anything.
I'm sorry.

407
00:27:39,810 --> 00:27:43,820
Don't apologize
and don't feel bad.

408
00:27:43,850 --> 00:27:45,480
I, um--
I started to bring in

409
00:27:45,520 --> 00:27:47,890
a couple of Timmy's things
to make you more comfortable.

410
00:27:47,920 --> 00:27:49,590
Do you like it?

411
00:27:49,620 --> 00:27:51,520
Was that
his favorite team?

412
00:27:51,560 --> 00:27:54,460
That's where he wanted to play,
wasn't it, Mark?

413
00:27:55,530 --> 00:27:56,760
Yes.

414
00:28:00,060 --> 00:28:01,870
I need to get up.

415
00:28:01,900 --> 00:28:04,470
I don't think
that's such a good idea.

416
00:28:04,500 --> 00:28:07,110
All right. Like I said,
I don't think that's
such a good idea.

417
00:28:07,140 --> 00:28:09,110
[screams]
Hey, hey, hey.
Whoa, whoa, whoa.

418
00:28:09,140 --> 00:28:12,540
Listen to me. All right?
Now, I let you have
your tough-guy moment.

419
00:28:12,580 --> 00:28:14,550
That's the last one
you get, okay? All right.

420
00:28:14,580 --> 00:28:17,380
We'll get you out of here.
Honey, you're gonna
take the lower part.

421
00:28:17,420 --> 00:28:19,480
We've done this before, okay?
We're gonna do it on three.

422
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:21,990
Put your arm around
my shoulder. Okay.

423
00:28:22,020 --> 00:28:24,620
One, two, three.

424
00:28:28,830 --> 00:28:32,100
[groans, sighs]

425
00:28:32,130 --> 00:28:35,870
When is this gonna stop?
I'd imagine soon.

426
00:28:35,900 --> 00:28:39,070
I don't think you have
anything left to throw up.

427
00:28:39,100 --> 00:28:42,940
Okay, I'm back.
Here we go.

428
00:28:44,040 --> 00:28:45,710
Here we go.

429
00:28:45,740 --> 00:28:48,650
Honey, let me in there.

430
00:28:49,850 --> 00:28:52,050
[toilet flushes]

431
00:28:52,080 --> 00:28:53,790
Okay.

432
00:28:55,590 --> 00:28:56,860
Here we go.

433
00:28:56,890 --> 00:29:00,090
Oh, you got it
all over your legs.

434
00:29:01,790 --> 00:29:03,960
Uh, they won't move.

435
00:29:04,000 --> 00:29:05,460
I can't move them.

436
00:29:05,500 --> 00:29:07,470
That's--That's nothing
to worry about.

437
00:29:07,500 --> 00:29:09,470
The swelling just has to
go down on your knees.

438
00:29:09,500 --> 00:29:11,640
That'll take about a week,
and then, eventually,

439
00:29:11,670 --> 00:29:15,810
you'll regain motion,
and you'll be able
to walk again.

440
00:29:15,840 --> 00:29:18,080
I'll tell you what.
Um, what's today?

441
00:29:18,110 --> 00:29:19,740
Sunday.

442
00:29:19,780 --> 00:29:21,510
You get better
by next Sunday,

443
00:29:21,550 --> 00:29:23,180
and I'll make you
a very special meal.

444
00:29:23,210 --> 00:29:25,520
How's that sound?

445
00:29:25,550 --> 00:29:27,950
[chuckles]
But right now,
you gotta get cleaned up,

446
00:29:27,990 --> 00:29:29,450
'cause you're starting
to smell like Mark

447
00:29:29,490 --> 00:29:30,960
after a long day
at the office,

448
00:29:30,990 --> 00:29:33,530
which is not pleasant.
[chuckles]

449
00:29:38,500 --> 00:29:41,070
Shouldn't he be done by now?

450
00:29:41,100 --> 00:29:42,200
Calm down.

451
00:29:42,230 --> 00:29:45,600
We gave him clean clothes,
put him in the wheelchair.

452
00:29:45,640 --> 00:29:48,940
He said he would call
when he was ready.

453
00:29:48,970 --> 00:29:51,710
You know me.
If I don't have something
to keep myself occupied,

454
00:29:51,740 --> 00:29:53,710
my mind wanders.

455
00:29:53,750 --> 00:29:57,750
[chuckles]
Now, that's
an understatement.

456
00:29:59,780 --> 00:30:01,720
Oh, really?

457
00:30:03,890 --> 00:30:06,860
Yes.
You're like a child.

458
00:30:06,890 --> 00:30:08,530
[chuckles]

459
00:30:08,560 --> 00:30:11,660
Well, would a--
would a child do this?

460
00:30:11,700 --> 00:30:13,570
[chuckles]

461
00:30:31,920 --> 00:30:33,550
[grunts]

462
00:30:34,950 --> 00:30:36,590
[grunts]

463
00:30:39,990 --> 00:30:41,490
[grunts]

464
00:30:45,700 --> 00:30:48,500
[sighing]

465
00:31:25,370 --> 00:31:27,140
[gasps]

466
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:29,940
I'm sorry.
I, uh...

467
00:31:29,970 --> 00:31:35,650
I just need, uh, help
putting on my shorts.

468
00:31:35,680 --> 00:31:37,720
[chuckling]

469
00:31:37,750 --> 00:31:39,280
Okay.
Oh.

470
00:31:39,320 --> 00:31:41,620
Actually,

471
00:31:41,650 --> 00:31:45,720
Mark, I need some help
in the bathroom, too.

472
00:31:46,890 --> 00:31:48,930
Uh, yeah, sure.

473
00:31:50,800 --> 00:31:53,670
[wheel squeaking]

474
00:31:53,700 --> 00:31:54,930
Hmm.

475
00:31:59,700 --> 00:32:02,340
I think that's
just 'cause it--

476
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:05,780
it hasn't been used
in a while.

477
00:32:05,810 --> 00:32:07,710
There. That's better.

478
00:32:07,750 --> 00:32:10,620
Speak for yourself.
What did you do to his hair?

479
00:32:10,650 --> 00:32:11,950
I didn't...
It was me.

480
00:32:11,980 --> 00:32:13,890
I couldn't find
a brush.

481
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,590
Out.
You've done your part.

482
00:32:18,020 --> 00:32:20,760
So how do you like it?
And before you say no, think.

483
00:32:20,790 --> 00:32:23,160
It's not wise to disappoint
a mother with a brush.

484
00:32:23,190 --> 00:32:25,760
Especially one who
takes hair so seriously.

485
00:32:25,800 --> 00:32:27,630
How it was before.

486
00:32:32,270 --> 00:32:35,310
Well, at least you don't have
that West Nile thing

487
00:32:35,340 --> 00:32:37,840
Marge has been going
on and on about.

488
00:32:37,880 --> 00:32:39,710
No, it's nothing like that.

489
00:32:39,740 --> 00:32:41,080
I didn't mean
to make you worry.

490
00:32:41,110 --> 00:32:43,680
This flu just made me
sleep through everything.

491
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,820
I should be better
for Monday.
No problem.

492
00:32:46,850 --> 00:32:49,650
We brought Marco in
from downtown to cover for you.

493
00:32:49,690 --> 00:32:51,860
Okay. Bye.

494
00:32:57,260 --> 00:32:59,930
Thanks for dialing for me.
Of course.

495
00:33:01,970 --> 00:33:04,940
If you need anything,
we're right on the other side
of this wall.

496
00:33:04,970 --> 00:33:07,970
And, well,
just to warn you, sweetie,

497
00:33:08,010 --> 00:33:10,810
sometimes...

498
00:33:10,840 --> 00:33:13,780
Well, this is gonna sound silly,
but sometimes I can't sleep,

499
00:33:13,810 --> 00:33:15,710
and I--I find myself

500
00:33:15,750 --> 00:33:18,850
sitting outside this door.

501
00:33:18,880 --> 00:33:21,220
It comforts me.

502
00:33:21,250 --> 00:33:23,890
So if you wake up
and you hear or see anyone,

503
00:33:23,920 --> 00:33:25,860
it's just me.

504
00:33:25,890 --> 00:33:28,260
You think that's weird?

505
00:33:28,290 --> 00:33:30,800
No.

506
00:33:30,830 --> 00:33:33,930
Um, sometimes I can't sleep
because of the quiet.

507
00:33:35,830 --> 00:33:38,700
I have to read myself
to sleep.

508
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:42,110
Do you think that's weird?

509
00:33:43,240 --> 00:33:44,680
No.

510
00:33:47,180 --> 00:33:50,410
That's the first real thing
you've shared with me, Alex.

511
00:33:51,750 --> 00:33:53,680
I'm glad we're
at that stage now.

512
00:33:55,190 --> 00:33:57,090
Good night.

513
00:34:00,420 --> 00:34:03,460
I think these are worse off
than when you gave them to me.

514
00:34:03,490 --> 00:34:05,760
[chuckles]
Men.

515
00:34:05,800 --> 00:34:07,230
Let me show you.

516
00:34:07,270 --> 00:34:09,870
Nothing is worse off

517
00:34:09,900 --> 00:34:10,970
after someone
has cared for it.

518
00:34:11,000 --> 00:34:12,740
Those were.

519
00:34:12,770 --> 00:34:14,370
Nothing.

520
00:34:17,110 --> 00:34:18,980
Timmy was the same
at first.

521
00:34:20,880 --> 00:34:24,420
He sat out here complaining,
but he got good,

522
00:34:24,450 --> 00:34:27,120
just like you will.

523
00:34:27,150 --> 00:34:30,250
That's where he would sit
and watch you, wasn't it?

524
00:34:33,960 --> 00:34:35,030
Yes.

525
00:34:39,130 --> 00:34:41,200
So what does Mark do?

526
00:34:41,230 --> 00:34:43,870
Um, he writes for
a sports Web site.

527
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:45,800
He used to write
for a bigger column,

528
00:34:45,840 --> 00:34:46,910
but he switched
to a smaller one

529
00:34:46,940 --> 00:34:49,210
so that he could write
from here and take care
of me.

530
00:34:50,340 --> 00:34:52,110
He doesn't get a lot
of writing done.

531
00:34:52,140 --> 00:34:54,110
Mostly,
he just keeps himself

532
00:34:54,150 --> 00:34:56,050
locked up in that
damn office closet,

533
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,450
which is off-limits to me.

534
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:06,390
Mark?

535
00:35:18,900 --> 00:35:20,910
I'm not in there.

536
00:35:20,940 --> 00:35:22,910
Uh, Alice said
you were looking for me.

537
00:35:22,940 --> 00:35:24,410
I thought you might be.

538
00:35:24,440 --> 00:35:26,340
All right. Are you right
or left-handed?

539
00:35:26,380 --> 00:35:27,580
Right-handed.
Okay.

540
00:35:27,610 --> 00:35:30,880
So, that's what
your grip looks like.

541
00:35:30,920 --> 00:35:32,820
Bring it up to your ear.

542
00:35:32,850 --> 00:35:35,020
As you throw,
it comes off like that.

543
00:35:38,860 --> 00:35:40,120
Did we miss anything?

544
00:35:40,160 --> 00:35:42,130
Beginning credits
just ended.

545
00:35:42,160 --> 00:35:43,960
[Woman on TV]
I'm Miss Childs,

546
00:35:44,000 --> 00:35:47,970
and I'll be filling in
as your substitute.

547
00:35:48,000 --> 00:35:50,030
You pick first, sweetie.

548
00:35:50,070 --> 00:35:52,170
I can choose
whatever I want?

549
00:36:02,580 --> 00:36:04,850
Monopoly.

550
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:08,990
Monopoly?

551
00:36:10,550 --> 00:36:12,320
Monopoly's perfect.

552
00:36:14,390 --> 00:36:15,830
I know.

553
00:36:32,410 --> 00:36:33,910
Oh!
No, no, no, no.

554
00:36:33,950 --> 00:36:36,880
Seven, eight, nine!
[all laugh]

555
00:36:43,220 --> 00:36:45,890
[Man on TV]
See you later.

556
00:36:45,920 --> 00:36:49,630
[Woman]
Honey, maybe you can go to
New York for graduate school.

557
00:36:49,660 --> 00:36:52,200
[TV continues, indistinct]

558
00:36:54,230 --> 00:36:56,100
[grunting]

559
00:36:59,570 --> 00:37:01,640
[grunting]

560
00:37:10,950 --> 00:37:14,120
Is all that prodding you do
to him really necessary?

561
00:37:14,150 --> 00:37:16,390
Stretching is essential
if he's gonna get any better.

562
00:37:16,420 --> 00:37:18,320
Not if it's gonna hurt him,
and that hurts him.

563
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:22,060
Okay, then, what else
do you want me to do?
Magically heal him?

564
00:37:22,090 --> 00:37:24,400
I'd like you to be
a little more careful.

565
00:37:24,430 --> 00:37:26,100
When have I
not been careful?

566
00:37:26,130 --> 00:37:27,400
I'm not gonna
argue about this.

567
00:37:27,430 --> 00:37:30,700
Really, when have I
not been careful?

568
00:37:30,730 --> 00:37:34,070
They don't look that much
different from yesterday.

569
00:37:34,110 --> 00:37:37,080
But they feel it.
I mean, I can probably get up
and walk right now.

570
00:37:37,110 --> 00:37:38,710
No, sweetie.
You're not ready.

571
00:37:38,740 --> 00:37:40,980
Let's wait until tomorrow
as planned,

572
00:37:41,010 --> 00:37:45,120
and if they still feel
this good, we'll get you up.

573
00:37:45,150 --> 00:37:48,090
But with crutches.

574
00:37:48,120 --> 00:37:49,190
Yeah.

575
00:38:07,510 --> 00:38:11,140
Alex! I'm home!

576
00:38:11,180 --> 00:38:13,210
Did you hear? That was me
breaking the fuck in!

577
00:38:13,240 --> 00:38:17,150
You're lucky it wasn't your face
for making me come back here
for days!

578
00:38:17,180 --> 00:38:19,980
[chuckles]
Neigh.

579
00:38:20,020 --> 00:38:21,650
** [rock]

580
00:38:21,690 --> 00:38:24,390
Fine.
I'm just gonna wait here

581
00:38:24,420 --> 00:38:27,690
until you decide
to man up and come out
from wherever you're hiding.

582
00:38:31,130 --> 00:38:32,560
You pussy.

583
00:38:32,600 --> 00:38:36,070
I bet I'm the first girl
you ever had in your bed.

584
00:38:36,100 --> 00:38:39,100
Disgusting.

585
00:38:40,240 --> 00:38:43,270
[Alice]
You know,
you don't have to leave.

586
00:38:43,310 --> 00:38:45,710
Even after you're better,
you can stay.

587
00:38:45,740 --> 00:38:48,710
I'll still make you
your special meal.

588
00:38:48,750 --> 00:38:51,050
I just wanna finish this.

589
00:38:52,220 --> 00:38:54,690
You've been pushing me away
all day. Why?

590
00:38:54,720 --> 00:38:56,350
I have to finish it.

591
00:38:56,390 --> 00:38:58,660
You don't have
to do anything.

592
00:38:58,690 --> 00:39:01,160
We would never make you do
something you didn't wanna do.

593
00:39:01,190 --> 00:39:04,130
Well, you're not
my parents.

594
00:39:09,070 --> 00:39:11,170
Tell me about them.

595
00:39:11,200 --> 00:39:13,640
I don't remember them.

596
00:39:13,670 --> 00:39:15,740
Everybody remembers
their parents.

597
00:39:15,770 --> 00:39:17,580
Not me.

598
00:39:17,610 --> 00:39:20,510
Well, don't you think
that's a little weird?

599
00:39:21,810 --> 00:39:24,220
Are you sure you're not
mad at me about something?

600
00:39:24,250 --> 00:39:27,190
Look, please just
leave me alone.

601
00:39:27,220 --> 00:39:30,550
I'm out of here tomorrow,
and then you don't have
to worry about me.

602
00:39:31,620 --> 00:39:33,260
It's gonna be okay.

603
00:39:33,290 --> 00:39:35,090
No, Mark.

604
00:39:35,130 --> 00:39:37,130
Just let me think.

605
00:39:40,100 --> 00:39:42,030
What's going on?

606
00:39:46,100 --> 00:39:48,210
He doesn't remember them.

607
00:40:39,190 --> 00:40:41,190
[Man]
Why don't you sit down
at the table

608
00:40:41,230 --> 00:40:43,190
and have some dinner, Alex?

609
00:40:43,230 --> 00:40:46,230
[Alex]
I'm not hungry.
Fine.

610
00:40:46,260 --> 00:40:48,770
You wanna talk to us
about this report card, then?

611
00:40:48,800 --> 00:40:52,170
What is it gonna take
for you to get off my back,
fucking die?

612
00:40:52,200 --> 00:40:53,670
[Woman]
You're horrible, awful.

613
00:40:53,700 --> 00:40:55,840
Only an awful person
would say such a thing.

614
00:40:55,870 --> 00:40:57,780
Get back here, Alex.
[door opens]

615
00:40:57,810 --> 00:41:00,110
Get back in this house, Alex!
[door closes]

616
00:41:01,180 --> 00:41:03,610
Mom? Dad?

617
00:41:03,650 --> 00:41:07,220
Dad? Mom?

618
00:41:07,250 --> 00:41:10,190
It's okay, honey.
You're okay. Let it out.
[sobbing]

619
00:41:10,220 --> 00:41:11,290
No, not this time.

620
00:41:11,320 --> 00:41:13,290
Let me go.
No.

621
00:41:13,320 --> 00:41:17,600
I don't like to let things
that are good out of my life.
Do you?

622
00:41:17,630 --> 00:41:19,560
Then why should I?

623
00:41:21,670 --> 00:41:25,240
Especially when I have something
that's gonna cheer you up.

624
00:41:27,340 --> 00:41:28,670
They look good.

625
00:41:28,710 --> 00:41:30,570
"Good"?

626
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:35,150
Morning. Ready to do
some walking?

627
00:41:36,650 --> 00:41:37,820
They're more than good.

628
00:41:37,850 --> 00:41:39,250
They're--
They're your favorite.

629
00:41:40,320 --> 00:41:42,650
No, bacon and eggs
are my favorite.

630
00:41:42,690 --> 00:41:45,190
But these are okay, too.

631
00:41:46,320 --> 00:41:48,230
What's going on, Alice?

632
00:41:48,260 --> 00:41:50,190
Well, I made him
his favorite breakfast food,

633
00:41:50,230 --> 00:41:52,230
hoping that it would
help him remember, but he...

634
00:41:52,260 --> 00:41:54,330
These-- These are okay.

635
00:41:54,370 --> 00:41:55,330
Really.

636
00:41:57,640 --> 00:42:00,340
It's all right, Alex.
I see what's happening.

637
00:42:00,370 --> 00:42:02,870
Do you?
Because it's so obvious.

638
00:42:02,910 --> 00:42:06,380
It's-- It's so obvious,
yet no one seems to see it.

639
00:42:06,410 --> 00:42:08,350
You're upset because
he's leaving today,

640
00:42:08,380 --> 00:42:10,380
so upset that you
accidentally

641
00:42:10,410 --> 00:42:13,350
made him Timmy's
favorite food,
not Alex's.

642
00:42:13,380 --> 00:42:15,750
No. No, that is not it.

643
00:42:15,790 --> 00:42:20,290
I bet if you take one bite,
it will help you remember.

644
00:42:20,320 --> 00:42:22,560
That's all it takes.
You know, just--

645
00:42:22,590 --> 00:42:25,260
just-- just
a familiar thing

646
00:42:25,300 --> 00:42:27,230
to help you remember.

647
00:42:29,430 --> 00:42:32,370
Just like
all those obvious signs
that you showed me.

648
00:42:32,400 --> 00:42:35,940
Listen. Here.
[doorbell rings]

649
00:42:35,970 --> 00:42:37,910
What can we do
for you, Father?

650
00:42:37,940 --> 00:42:41,310
Well, me and the other fathers
have taken it upon ourselves

651
00:42:41,350 --> 00:42:44,250
to reach out
to the member base--

652
00:42:44,280 --> 00:42:47,350
to the ones who haven't
been led in prayer recently.

653
00:42:47,390 --> 00:42:49,290
And according to the directory,

654
00:42:49,320 --> 00:42:51,290
it's been over a year
since you've been in,

655
00:42:51,320 --> 00:42:54,360
so I wanted to come on down
and re-invite you

656
00:42:54,390 --> 00:42:56,660
to services at St. Matthews.

657
00:42:56,690 --> 00:42:58,460
And how is Timmy?

658
00:42:58,500 --> 00:43:01,930
Has the Lord struck
the sickness out of him yet?

659
00:43:01,970 --> 00:43:04,670
He's getting better. Yes.
It's sweet of you to wonder.

660
00:43:06,840 --> 00:43:09,340
Ah! There he is.

661
00:43:09,370 --> 00:43:11,480
Hello, Timmy.
How are you?

662
00:43:11,510 --> 00:43:14,780
[Alice]
He's grown shy
since the disease.

663
00:43:14,810 --> 00:43:17,750
He doesn't feel comfortable
in his own skin.

664
00:43:19,950 --> 00:43:22,420
Uh, Father, we were--

665
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,360
we were sort of
in the middle of something.

666
00:43:24,390 --> 00:43:26,290
So if there's nothing else...
I'm sorry.

667
00:43:26,320 --> 00:43:28,360
No, no.
Uh, thank you.

668
00:43:28,390 --> 00:43:30,290
Excuse me.
Have a good day.

669
00:43:32,700 --> 00:43:34,800
What the hell
are you doing?
Shh!

670
00:43:34,830 --> 00:43:37,030
You don't want the priest
to hear you swearing like that.

671
00:43:37,070 --> 00:43:39,040
Why doesn't he know
Timmy is dead?

672
00:43:41,040 --> 00:43:44,070
Oh, sweetie, no one knows.

673
00:43:44,110 --> 00:43:46,580
We didn't see the point
of telling anyone when we--

674
00:43:46,610 --> 00:43:48,580
we knew you
were coming back.

675
00:43:48,610 --> 00:43:51,010
You've escaped
from the monsters.

676
00:43:51,050 --> 00:43:53,880
Returned like you said
you would.

677
00:43:57,020 --> 00:43:58,490
Alice...
Mark.

678
00:43:58,520 --> 00:44:00,860
Alice, stop.

679
00:44:00,890 --> 00:44:02,330
See?

680
00:44:08,370 --> 00:44:09,930
It's my fault.

681
00:44:09,970 --> 00:44:12,400
It's mine.

682
00:44:12,440 --> 00:44:14,570
I should've known sooner.

683
00:44:14,610 --> 00:44:16,910
Maybe if I had, you wouldn't
have gotten hurt again.

684
00:44:16,940 --> 00:44:20,380
I shouldn't have stayed.
I was selfish.

685
00:44:20,410 --> 00:44:22,550
Oh, Timmy,
you had no choice.

686
00:44:22,580 --> 00:44:23,980
You were drawn to it.
It's your house.

687
00:44:25,380 --> 00:44:27,890
I'm not Timmy.

688
00:44:28,950 --> 00:44:30,790
Well, of course, you are.

689
00:44:30,820 --> 00:44:32,960
Listen. Look, you, uh--

690
00:44:32,990 --> 00:44:35,360
You knew where you used
to sit in the garden,

691
00:44:35,390 --> 00:44:36,390
you knew your favorite game

692
00:44:36,430 --> 00:44:37,800
was Monopoly...
Alice!

693
00:44:37,830 --> 00:44:39,400
Enough!

694
00:44:46,770 --> 00:44:48,640
[grunts]
Let me help.

695
00:44:48,670 --> 00:44:50,710
You're not ready.

696
00:44:50,740 --> 00:44:51,680
[vase shatters]

697
00:44:53,680 --> 00:44:56,410
You're not ready.
[screams]

698
00:44:56,450 --> 00:44:58,920
[sniffling]

699
00:45:02,950 --> 00:45:06,460
We failed, didn't we?
We lost him again.

700
00:45:06,490 --> 00:45:10,990
No. Alice,
Alex is not dead.

701
00:45:11,030 --> 00:45:12,760
Now, I have
bandaged his feet.

702
00:45:12,800 --> 00:45:14,400
The paramedics can do
the rest when they get here.

703
00:45:14,430 --> 00:45:17,940
You called an ambulance?
I'm calling one, and then
I'm calling a doctor for you.

704
00:45:17,970 --> 00:45:21,540
How could you do that
after everything that
he has told us and shown us?

705
00:45:21,570 --> 00:45:24,610
You used to believe
that he would come back.

706
00:45:27,550 --> 00:45:29,680
I was shock--
We were in shock.

707
00:45:29,710 --> 00:45:32,750
Two parents believing
in their son is not shock,

708
00:45:32,780 --> 00:45:34,420
it's love.

709
00:45:34,450 --> 00:45:35,620
No.

710
00:45:35,650 --> 00:45:37,520
Read this.

711
00:45:39,560 --> 00:45:42,460
"Dear Mom and Dad,
I can't do this to you anymore.

712
00:45:42,490 --> 00:45:45,530
"You both are too good
of parents to deserve
the pain I've caused you.

713
00:45:45,560 --> 00:45:47,500
"I'll come back
when I'm better.

714
00:45:47,530 --> 00:45:49,470
Love, Timmy."

715
00:45:58,840 --> 00:46:01,210
This was in the vase?
Yes.

716
00:46:01,240 --> 00:46:03,580
You saw it.
He knocked the vase down.

717
00:46:03,610 --> 00:46:05,080
He broke it. Why?

718
00:46:05,120 --> 00:46:06,950
Because he put a note
in there a year ago,

719
00:46:06,980 --> 00:46:09,750
knowing it was my favorite vase,
but we never found it.

720
00:46:09,790 --> 00:46:11,620
So he showed us.

721
00:46:11,660 --> 00:46:14,190
He's trying to tell us it's him,
even if he doesn't know it yet,

722
00:46:14,220 --> 00:46:17,700
and we have to listen.

723
00:46:17,730 --> 00:46:20,830
It's not possible.
I want it to be,
but it's not--

724
00:46:20,860 --> 00:46:22,770
Just think about
what's happened.

725
00:46:22,800 --> 00:46:24,540
That's all I'm asking.

726
00:46:24,570 --> 00:46:28,170
He tries to leave,
and he gets hit,

727
00:46:28,210 --> 00:46:30,540
and then we get another chance
to realize it's him.

728
00:46:30,570 --> 00:46:31,540
And I do.

729
00:46:31,580 --> 00:46:33,810
So does the priest,
a man of God.

730
00:46:33,840 --> 00:46:36,750
But still, we argue,
and what happens?

731
00:46:36,780 --> 00:46:39,580
He gets hurt again.

732
00:46:39,620 --> 00:46:43,090
We can't keep denying it.

733
00:46:44,990 --> 00:46:47,120
If we do,

734
00:46:47,160 --> 00:46:50,830
the next time he leaves,
we won't be so lucky.

735
00:46:51,900 --> 00:46:54,230
And neither will he.

736
00:47:05,140 --> 00:47:08,150
[bird chirping]

737
00:47:08,180 --> 00:47:10,610
[Alice]
It's singing for us, sweetie.

738
00:47:10,650 --> 00:47:14,220
Singing because
it's so happy.

739
00:47:22,960 --> 00:47:24,760
[chuckles]

740
00:47:24,800 --> 00:47:26,860
You need a haircut,
Timmy.

741
00:47:27,930 --> 00:47:30,670
It's gotten too long.

742
00:47:30,700 --> 00:47:32,200
We'll, um...

743
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:34,540
get you all fixed up
after you're feeling better.

744
00:47:34,570 --> 00:47:36,670
How's that sound?

745
00:47:36,710 --> 00:47:38,680
I'm, uh...
I'm not Timmy.

746
00:47:38,710 --> 00:47:40,810
[Mark]
Whoa. Easy there, champ.

747
00:47:40,840 --> 00:47:43,280
You need to stay calm,
all right?

748
00:47:43,310 --> 00:47:46,620
This will be worse
than a tackle.

749
00:47:46,650 --> 00:47:48,650
And he's taken plenty
of those.

750
00:47:48,690 --> 00:47:50,620
Okay? Trust me.

751
00:47:50,650 --> 00:47:53,120
Trust me, buddy.
You just...

752
00:47:53,160 --> 00:47:55,130
[panting]
You'd much rather get this

753
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:58,130
than have me stitch you up
without it.

754
00:47:58,160 --> 00:48:01,570
[Alice]
Shh, shh, shh!
I can't move!

755
00:48:01,600 --> 00:48:04,570
[grunts, mutters]

756
00:48:04,600 --> 00:48:07,200
Shhhh!

757
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,270
We can't have you hurting
yourself again.

758
00:48:10,310 --> 00:48:12,940
We need to make sure
you're safe.

759
00:48:38,670 --> 00:48:40,600
[dial tone]

760
00:48:41,870 --> 00:48:44,240
What's wrong?

761
00:48:44,270 --> 00:48:46,810
That was Alex's mother.

762
00:48:46,840 --> 00:48:49,210
She called me a monster.

763
00:48:49,250 --> 00:48:53,180
She said he was safe at home
and never coming back.

764
00:48:53,220 --> 00:48:54,180
Oh!

765
00:48:54,220 --> 00:48:56,750
How is he?
Sleeping.

766
00:48:56,790 --> 00:49:00,190
I'm just getting his pain pills
together for the week.

767
00:49:01,790 --> 00:49:05,130
Is everything else
taken care of?

768
00:49:05,160 --> 00:49:07,060
Yeah.

769
00:49:07,100 --> 00:49:09,770
He, uh, should be safe.

770
00:49:09,800 --> 00:49:12,040
No way a burglar
could get in or out.

771
00:49:12,070 --> 00:49:14,300
How about a safecracker?

772
00:49:18,280 --> 00:49:21,980
I don't know what's worse,
the knee injury or his feet.

773
00:49:22,010 --> 00:49:24,680
I mean, 50 stitches
can't be pleasant.

774
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:27,990
Honey, he'll play again.

775
00:49:38,760 --> 00:49:41,030
Morning, bright eyes.

776
00:49:41,060 --> 00:49:43,300
You look happy to see me.

777
00:49:43,330 --> 00:49:46,700
Your, uh, father's gonna come
on in and check your bandages,

778
00:49:46,740 --> 00:49:48,170
but I wanted
to come in first.

779
00:49:48,210 --> 00:49:51,740
You okay?
[footsteps approaching]

780
00:49:58,720 --> 00:50:01,720
It's okay.
It's the anesthetic.

781
00:50:01,750 --> 00:50:04,220
Dries your mouth out
the first day.

782
00:50:04,250 --> 00:50:06,690
My poor baby.

783
00:50:08,030 --> 00:50:10,860
Here. Um...

784
00:50:10,890 --> 00:50:15,300
Why don't you write down,
oh, what you're thinking?

785
00:50:18,070 --> 00:50:20,870
There you go.

786
00:50:20,900 --> 00:50:22,740
I'll hold it for you.

787
00:50:33,420 --> 00:50:35,020
Done?

788
00:50:40,790 --> 00:50:43,760
Let's get you back in.

789
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:45,700
I know. I know.

790
00:50:46,900 --> 00:50:49,900
There we go.
All safe and sound.

791
00:50:54,870 --> 00:50:57,310
It's not very nice.

792
00:50:57,340 --> 00:50:59,240
It's not nice at all.

793
00:50:59,280 --> 00:51:01,210
And we raised you better.

794
00:51:12,490 --> 00:51:15,390
[locks clicking]

795
00:51:21,100 --> 00:51:23,730
Going through your shirts!

796
00:51:27,270 --> 00:51:28,770
Ugh.

797
00:51:28,810 --> 00:51:31,010
[gasps]
Oh, sparkly.

798
00:51:34,810 --> 00:51:37,050
I'm stealing
your jewelry box.

799
00:51:40,950 --> 00:51:43,020
[sighs]

800
00:51:43,050 --> 00:51:45,260
Consider it payment for making
me come back here for days

801
00:51:45,290 --> 00:51:47,360
when I could've been stealing
other people's shit.

802
00:51:53,000 --> 00:51:55,030
I want to...

803
00:51:56,200 --> 00:51:57,970
move.

804
00:51:58,000 --> 00:52:00,140
What?
Move.

805
00:52:03,370 --> 00:52:05,340
Um, okay.

806
00:52:05,380 --> 00:52:08,050
Okay, but you can't
tell Alice, okay?

807
00:52:08,080 --> 00:52:09,910
We'll just stay
in here.

808
00:52:09,950 --> 00:52:11,380
Deal?

809
00:52:21,930 --> 00:52:24,930
Oh, you see?
See how much better
your knees are?

810
00:52:24,960 --> 00:52:27,230
You couldn't bend them
like that three days ago.

811
00:52:30,100 --> 00:52:32,170
So, uh...

812
00:52:32,200 --> 00:52:34,100
So, uh, I didn't know.

813
00:52:34,140 --> 00:52:38,010
I mean, you hadn't talked
about it, but had you--

814
00:52:38,040 --> 00:52:41,080
Had you still wanted
to go there?

815
00:52:41,110 --> 00:52:43,910
Because if you did,
I'll bet

816
00:52:43,950 --> 00:52:45,920
if you got back in shape
in the next six months,

817
00:52:45,950 --> 00:52:49,450
you could still make
the fall tryouts.

818
00:52:49,490 --> 00:52:50,890
Please.

819
00:52:52,020 --> 00:52:54,160
Let me leave.

820
00:53:02,030 --> 00:53:04,500
Don't-- Don't put any weight
on your feet.

821
00:53:04,530 --> 00:53:07,200
You don't want those stitches
popping out.

822
00:53:10,910 --> 00:53:12,040
[door closes]

823
00:53:12,080 --> 00:53:14,180
[lock clicks]

824
00:53:42,110 --> 00:53:44,910
What do you think?

825
00:53:56,450 --> 00:54:00,060
You're not mad
that I took everything
out of storage, are you?

826
00:54:31,120 --> 00:54:34,090
[sprinkler whirring]

827
00:54:45,140 --> 00:54:47,440
[locks clicking]

828
00:54:47,470 --> 00:54:51,110
Look at what
I made for you.

829
00:54:51,140 --> 00:54:53,610
Mark!
What is he doing up?

830
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:56,150
He's not ready!

831
00:54:56,180 --> 00:54:58,120
See?
He has hurt himself already.

832
00:54:58,150 --> 00:54:59,480
I thought if he
could move around--

833
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:01,650
You have to let me go.

834
00:55:01,680 --> 00:55:03,990
Please.

835
00:55:04,020 --> 00:55:06,420
People are expecting me.

836
00:55:06,460 --> 00:55:08,590
People I work with.

837
00:55:08,630 --> 00:55:11,130
The monsters?
Don't worry, sweetie.

838
00:55:11,160 --> 00:55:13,000
I told them
that you were home,

839
00:55:13,030 --> 00:55:14,360
and that you're
not coming back.

840
00:55:14,400 --> 00:55:16,070
They can't hurt
you anymore.

841
00:55:16,100 --> 00:55:19,440
I'm not home.
This isn't my home.

842
00:55:19,470 --> 00:55:22,370
This is how
you treat your parents

843
00:55:22,410 --> 00:55:24,570
when they try
to help you?

844
00:55:24,610 --> 00:55:27,440
I'm not--
Don't even think
about saying

845
00:55:27,480 --> 00:55:29,610
such hurtful things.

846
00:55:31,280 --> 00:55:33,180
Please.

847
00:55:33,220 --> 00:55:35,320
I'm not your son.

848
00:55:41,620 --> 00:55:43,990
Check his feet
and get him in bed.

849
00:55:55,170 --> 00:55:58,480
I do not like treating you
like you are six again,

850
00:55:58,510 --> 00:56:01,380
but since nasty things have been
coming out of your mouth,
you leave me no choice.

851
00:56:01,410 --> 00:56:04,510
[coughing]
I want you to lay here and think
about what you've done.

852
00:56:04,550 --> 00:56:08,290
I will be back at 10:00,
and it better be a clean mouth
that I return to.

853
00:56:08,320 --> 00:56:11,250
[panting]

854
00:56:11,290 --> 00:56:14,090
[locks clicking]

855
00:56:22,330 --> 00:56:25,540
Hi. Uh, this is Mark Smith
for Dr. Nance.

856
00:56:25,570 --> 00:56:27,670
Please, call me Jack.

857
00:56:27,700 --> 00:56:30,440
We have, after all,
met many times before.

858
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,640
No, we haven't.
I've never met you before.

859
00:56:33,680 --> 00:56:37,150
Why would you say that when,
in fact, we have, several times?

860
00:56:37,180 --> 00:56:39,150
Don't you remember
I used to come here

861
00:56:39,180 --> 00:56:41,280
for your family's
counseling sessions?

862
00:56:41,320 --> 00:56:44,450
I know I've probably put on
a few love pounds,
as I like to call them,

863
00:56:44,490 --> 00:56:46,790
but surely I don't look
that much different
from last year.

864
00:56:46,820 --> 00:56:51,260
My name is Alex Wells.

865
00:56:51,290 --> 00:56:54,260
I'm not their son.

866
00:56:54,300 --> 00:56:58,100
I look like him,
but it's not me.
He's dead.

867
00:57:00,470 --> 00:57:04,210
Do you know why
your father called me?

868
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:08,580
Your family has relapsed,
and he asked me to intervene.

869
00:57:08,610 --> 00:57:09,880
Last time,
it was for them--

870
00:57:09,910 --> 00:57:13,150
for the difficulty
they were having
in dealing with your illness.

871
00:57:13,180 --> 00:57:15,350
It was quite simply
destroying them.

872
00:57:15,390 --> 00:57:17,220
We're passed that now.

873
00:57:17,250 --> 00:57:19,520
We've accepted it,
and we're here only
for him.

874
00:57:19,560 --> 00:57:22,190
Absolutely.
That's right.

875
00:57:22,230 --> 00:57:24,460
Please.

876
00:57:24,490 --> 00:57:25,830
You don't understand.

877
00:57:25,860 --> 00:57:28,170
Tell me,
what am I not understanding?

878
00:57:28,200 --> 00:57:31,170
That I'm not Timmy.

879
00:57:31,200 --> 00:57:32,900
They're trying
to make me into him.

880
00:57:32,940 --> 00:57:35,570
I told you, he's dead.

881
00:57:35,610 --> 00:57:39,280
Could it be that maybe that's
what you feel deep inside,

882
00:57:39,310 --> 00:57:41,280
that you're dead,

883
00:57:41,310 --> 00:57:43,350
and that's why you've
taken on this other persona?

884
00:57:43,380 --> 00:57:45,650
It's not a persona.

885
00:57:47,880 --> 00:57:50,720
They lock me in a room.

886
00:57:51,790 --> 00:57:53,760
They tie me to a bed.

887
00:57:53,790 --> 00:57:56,160
Those are medical restraints.
We don't like using them.

888
00:57:56,190 --> 00:57:58,160
We only use them
when he's sleeping.

889
00:57:58,200 --> 00:58:00,900
But he's continually
trying to hurt himself.

890
00:58:00,930 --> 00:58:03,700
Like his feet.
He tried to go out
the front door the other day.

891
00:58:03,730 --> 00:58:05,870
I knew he wasn't ready.
He lost his balance,

892
00:58:05,900 --> 00:58:08,270
knocked over a vase,
and he fell onto
the broken glass.

893
00:58:08,310 --> 00:58:11,910
You can't believe this.
Don't believe this.
Look at his face.

894
00:58:11,940 --> 00:58:15,310
I see concern
on his face, Timmy.

895
00:58:15,350 --> 00:58:17,410
Now, I may not condone
the methods,

896
00:58:17,450 --> 00:58:19,280
but if you're gonna try
to hurt yourself,

897
00:58:19,320 --> 00:58:20,880
what choice do they have?

898
00:58:20,920 --> 00:58:23,190
Put you in
a medical facility?

899
00:58:23,220 --> 00:58:24,950
Someone has
to take care of you,

900
00:58:24,990 --> 00:58:28,590
and wouldn't you prefer
that it be them?

901
00:58:28,630 --> 00:58:31,430
I think the reason
that he's retreated
into this other persona

902
00:58:31,460 --> 00:58:33,800
is out of fear
of what's happening to him.

903
00:58:33,830 --> 00:58:35,970
For him to come out,
he needs to feel assured

904
00:58:36,000 --> 00:58:38,270
that it's okay
to live as Timmy again.

905
00:58:38,300 --> 00:58:40,370
But how do we do that?

906
00:58:40,400 --> 00:58:41,670
Make things comfortable.

907
00:58:41,700 --> 00:58:45,940
Remind him that it's okay
and fun to live as Timmy.

908
00:58:45,980 --> 00:58:47,610
We--
Even with his disability.

909
00:58:47,640 --> 00:58:49,280
We have. I have.

910
00:58:49,310 --> 00:58:50,580
We've, uh--

911
00:58:50,610 --> 00:58:52,280
We've done some
of his favorite things

912
00:58:52,320 --> 00:58:53,950
to make him feel
at home.

913
00:58:53,980 --> 00:58:56,290
He even chose some,
like Monopoly

914
00:58:56,320 --> 00:58:57,990
or his favorite movie.

915
00:58:58,020 --> 00:59:01,390
Yes, yes, but who was he
during those times?

916
00:59:01,420 --> 00:59:03,390
Alex.
Exactly.

917
00:59:03,430 --> 00:59:05,830
He's living the good things
as Alex,

918
00:59:05,860 --> 00:59:07,660
completely forgetting
that he used to experience

919
00:59:07,700 --> 00:59:10,230
those exact same things
as Timmy.

920
00:59:10,270 --> 00:59:12,240
And they were still good.

921
00:59:12,270 --> 00:59:14,240
So we need to show him
that he can have fun

922
00:59:14,270 --> 00:59:15,710
and enjoy things
as Timmy.

923
00:59:15,740 --> 00:59:17,040
But you must be firm.

924
00:59:17,070 --> 00:59:20,380
He may not remember
that something used to be
his favorite thing.

925
00:59:20,410 --> 00:59:23,650
Blocked it out so he can
experience it new as Alex.

926
00:59:23,680 --> 00:59:25,350
Don't let him.

927
00:59:25,380 --> 00:59:27,550
Be firm,
like you would a child.

928
00:59:27,580 --> 00:59:29,790
And hopefully, in time,
he'll come out of his shell

929
00:59:29,820 --> 00:59:33,520
and remember, "Hey,
it's okay to be Timmy."

930
00:59:34,920 --> 00:59:36,830
Is that okay
with you, Timmy?

931
00:59:36,860 --> 00:59:40,630
Participating in sessions
with your parents?

932
00:59:40,660 --> 00:59:44,400
If I do, could I try sleeping
without restraints

933
00:59:44,430 --> 00:59:47,300
and having my door unlocked?

934
00:59:47,340 --> 00:59:49,040
Well, if you promise
not to hurt yourself,

935
00:59:49,070 --> 00:59:52,310
and your parents are comfortable
with where you are,

936
00:59:52,340 --> 00:59:54,340
I don't see why not.

937
01:00:00,050 --> 01:00:01,980
Thank you.

938
01:00:03,390 --> 01:00:04,920
For?

939
01:00:04,950 --> 01:00:07,020
For calling Dr. Nance.

940
01:00:07,060 --> 01:00:09,360
Mmm.

941
01:00:09,390 --> 01:00:10,430
I gotta tell you,

942
01:00:10,460 --> 01:00:13,060
I was really starting
to lose it.

943
01:00:13,100 --> 01:00:15,400
Just having him
in our grasp

944
01:00:15,430 --> 01:00:18,440
and not knowing
how to bring him back,

945
01:00:18,470 --> 01:00:20,400
what else to do.

946
01:00:22,370 --> 01:00:25,540
Wanna see the first exercise
I have planned?

947
01:00:26,710 --> 01:00:30,380
Then plant this exactly
where you used to.

948
01:00:31,450 --> 01:00:33,780
And, Timmy,
no funny business.

949
01:00:33,820 --> 01:00:36,620
I'll be watching to make sure
you do it right.

950
01:00:49,570 --> 01:00:51,500
[door opens]

951
01:00:57,870 --> 01:00:59,480
Okay.

952
01:01:02,040 --> 01:01:04,080
Where would Timmy plant?

953
01:01:29,170 --> 01:01:32,780
Come on, Timmy.
Stop fooling around.

954
01:01:37,680 --> 01:01:39,480
[glass shatters]

955
01:01:58,500 --> 01:01:59,400
[glass shatters]

956
01:02:22,890 --> 01:02:24,830
[glass crunching]

957
01:02:28,030 --> 01:02:29,770
[glass shatters]

958
01:03:02,970 --> 01:03:05,470
Pick your player.

959
01:03:13,510 --> 01:03:15,910
That's enough, young man.

960
01:03:15,950 --> 01:03:18,880
Pick the piece
you always use.

961
01:03:29,590 --> 01:03:31,990
Alice, stop. Your hand...
I don't care.

962
01:03:32,030 --> 01:03:34,830
I'm not playing around anymore.

963
01:03:34,860 --> 01:03:36,930
Which you clearly still are.

964
01:03:36,970 --> 01:03:38,640
But that's fine.

965
01:03:38,670 --> 01:03:40,570
I'm gonna be firm.
I need to be.

966
01:03:40,600 --> 01:03:42,510
And if I get hurt
in the process,

967
01:03:42,540 --> 01:03:44,710
then at least
you'll see the pain
your little game is causing.

968
01:03:46,180 --> 01:03:48,810
Now, go again.

969
01:04:18,880 --> 01:04:20,680
Very good.
[relieved sigh]

970
01:04:20,710 --> 01:04:25,050
Now, you two,
let's have some fun.

971

01:04:51,640 --> 01:04:53,810
Volume knobs were invented

could get work done
in the other room.

983

Why is your door locked?

984
01:05:01,320 --> 01:05:03,290
Did you steal
something again?

985
01:05:03,320 --> 01:05:06,660
[sighs]
Just your heart, Father.

986
01:05:06,690 --> 01:05:09,560

You excited?

995
01:05:37,820 --> 01:05:39,760
You should be.

996
01:05:39,790 --> 01:05:43,160
He's been in his office
preparing for your exercise.

997
01:05:43,190 --> 01:05:46,000
And, uh, don't worry.

998
01:05:46,030 --> 01:05:48,800
I figured out a way
to make sure you don't
get hurt again.

999
01:05:49,870 --> 01:05:52,740
[Alice]
He's all yours.

1000
01:05:52,770 --> 01:05:54,040
I am going shopping.

1001
01:05:54,070 --> 01:05:55,840
Bye, honey.

1002
01:05:58,940 --> 01:06:00,780
[Mark]
You have a good night's sleep?

1003
01:06:00,810 --> 01:06:01,810
[Alex]
Yeah.

1004
01:06:01,840 --> 01:06:03,110
Best one yet.

1005
01:06:03,150 --> 01:06:04,850
Good. Good.

1006
01:06:04,880 --> 01:06:08,050
So, um, you--you probably
didn't have a chance

1007
01:06:08,080 --> 01:06:10,750
to see yesterday's
scores yet.

1008
01:06:10,790 --> 01:06:13,290
In fact, you--
you probably haven't had
a chance to catch up

1009
01:06:13,320 --> 01:06:15,960
with the scores
from this past year

1010
01:06:15,990 --> 01:06:19,130
since things have been
so weird for you
and all, huh?

1011
01:06:19,160 --> 01:06:21,830
No, I haven't, but, uh,
I'm dying to know.

1012
01:06:21,860 --> 01:06:22,930
Trust me.

1013
01:06:24,170 --> 01:06:27,070
Then wait until
you see this.

1014
01:06:41,950 --> 01:06:44,350
I started it
when I had to...

1015
01:06:44,390 --> 01:06:48,090
give up on you
coming back.

1016
01:06:48,120 --> 01:06:50,230
There's a section for

1017
01:06:50,260 --> 01:06:54,030
all your favorite baseball,
basketball, and football teams,

1018
01:06:54,060 --> 01:06:56,800
and every game,
every score,

1019
01:06:56,830 --> 01:06:59,070
every standing
from the past year.

1020
01:06:59,100 --> 01:07:01,770
All your favorite
athletes, too.

1021
01:07:01,800 --> 01:07:03,810
It's all here.

1022
01:07:04,870 --> 01:07:08,340
[chuckles]
See that one?

1023
01:07:08,380 --> 01:07:11,850
I must've read
that one 500 times.

1024
01:07:11,880 --> 01:07:14,750
Every time I did, I...

1025
01:07:14,780 --> 01:07:18,220
I could hear how excited
you would've been.

1026
01:07:18,250 --> 01:07:21,420
It had to seem like
you were still almost here.

1027
01:07:28,800 --> 01:07:30,900
You still know.

1028
01:07:30,930 --> 01:07:32,840
You know
this isn't right, Mark.

1029
01:07:32,870 --> 01:07:34,300
You know it's not me.

1030
01:07:34,340 --> 01:07:36,410
Listen. Just--Just listen.
Listen to me.

1031
01:07:36,440 --> 01:07:39,380
They're down by one,
and all they need's
a field goal.

1032
01:07:39,410 --> 01:07:41,040
You know?
Just...

1033
01:07:41,080 --> 01:07:42,380
And it's raining.

1034
01:07:42,410 --> 01:07:44,050
Just let me go
before she gets back, please.

1035
01:07:44,080 --> 01:07:45,210
Listen to me.
Please.

1036
01:07:45,250 --> 01:07:46,750
It's great.
They're down by one.

1037
01:07:50,520 --> 01:07:53,960
You, uh, shampooed
your hair yet, sweetie?

1038
01:07:53,990 --> 01:07:55,790
I was just about to.

1039
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:57,260
Let me.

1040
01:08:01,500 --> 01:08:05,770
Do you know why your father
is sitting in his office upset?

1041
01:08:05,800 --> 01:08:07,440

what you said.

To me it sounded
like you wanted to leave.

That for every step forward,
you were taking a step back.

this past year, you know?

to begin with, young man?

as if you saw it

01:18:57,620 --> 01:18:59,590
You can go back to bed.

1214
01:18:59,620 --> 01:19:02,420
Only if I can help you
back to yours.

1215
01:19:08,500 --> 01:19:10,530
We've come a long way
since then, haven't we?

1216
01:19:13,130 --> 01:19:16,610
You don't remember
that yet, do you?

1217
01:19:16,640 --> 01:19:18,710
How you first died.

1218
01:19:19,980 --> 01:19:21,780
You thought you were
a burden.

1219
01:19:21,810 --> 01:19:25,780
You didn't wanna be,
and so you tried
to sneak out.

1220
01:19:25,810 --> 01:19:27,780
You saw us coming,
you tried to run,

1221
01:19:27,820 --> 01:19:31,890
and your body
couldn't take it.

1222
01:19:31,920 --> 01:19:33,720
You fell.

1223
01:19:35,520 --> 01:19:38,490
We stayed with you
for days,

1224
01:19:38,530 --> 01:19:41,500
waiting for you
to come back.

1225
01:19:41,530 --> 01:19:44,130
We didn't know
it would take a year.

1226
01:19:49,270 --> 01:19:51,610
That is over now.

1227
01:19:51,640 --> 01:19:52,910
We are passed it.

1228
01:19:52,940 --> 01:19:54,610
Let's get you back to bed.

1229
01:19:54,640 --> 01:19:57,480
Oh, give me your water.
I'll hold it for you.

1230
01:20:00,950 --> 01:20:02,850
Were you trying
to sneak out again?

1231
01:20:02,880 --> 01:20:04,850
No. I just...

1232
01:20:04,890 --> 01:20:07,220
I just forgot my glass
in the kitchen.

1233
01:20:07,260 --> 01:20:09,530
But I don't understand.

1234
01:20:09,560 --> 01:20:11,260
We've been good.

1235
01:20:11,290 --> 01:20:14,130
You're not a burden anymore.
Why would you...

1236
01:20:16,600 --> 01:20:18,700
You're not fully back.
You lied.

1237
01:20:18,730 --> 01:20:20,770
Let me go.
I will not!

1238
01:20:20,800 --> 01:20:22,700
We trusted you,
and you lied.

1239
01:20:22,740 --> 01:20:25,540
You said you were better.
We celebrated your birthday.

1240
01:20:25,570 --> 01:20:27,280
I'm not your son!

1241
01:20:27,310 --> 01:20:29,580
You are horrible, awful!

1242
01:20:29,610 --> 01:20:31,880
Only a horrible child
would say such a thing!

1243
01:20:31,910 --> 01:20:35,920
What's going on? Alice?
Mark, he's trying to leave.

1244
01:20:35,950 --> 01:20:37,750
Don't turn him against you,
all right?
No.

1245
01:20:37,790 --> 01:20:38,850
Alice--
No. No.

1246
01:20:38,890 --> 01:20:40,690
Let's talk about it,
all right?

1247
01:20:40,720 --> 01:20:42,860
Let's see what the problem is.
Sweetie--Sweetie...

1248
01:20:42,890 --> 01:20:45,530
Everybody take a deep breath.
Listen to me. Listen to me.

1249
01:20:45,560 --> 01:20:48,900
Maybe we need to slow down.
Let me go!

1250
01:20:48,930 --> 01:20:51,230
I'm not Timmy!
[body thuds]

1251
01:20:52,570 --> 01:20:54,540
He's okay, right, Mark?

1252
01:20:54,570 --> 01:20:56,940
Tell me.
Tell me he's okay.

1253
01:20:58,770 --> 01:21:01,040
Tell me he's okay!

1254
01:21:27,300 --> 01:21:29,200
Don't say it.

1255
01:21:31,110 --> 01:21:33,880
Alice, please.

1256
01:21:33,910 --> 01:21:37,610
It's only been 10 hours.

1257
01:21:38,710 --> 01:21:40,980
Ten hours!

1258
01:21:41,020 --> 01:21:43,620
Last time,
it took a year.

1259
01:21:44,920 --> 01:21:46,890
So don't say it.

1260
01:21:50,330 --> 01:21:51,760
No.

1261
01:21:53,190 --> 01:21:54,630
No!

1262
01:22:18,290 --> 01:22:20,790
[Alex]
Come back.

1263
01:22:20,820 --> 01:22:22,690
Come back!

1264
01:22:25,730 --> 01:22:28,930
[sighs]
I'm not dead.

1265
01:22:28,960 --> 01:22:31,730
I'm still alive.

1266
01:22:33,030 --> 01:22:37,240
Please, please come back.

1267
01:22:38,810 --> 01:22:40,680
Please come back,
Mom and Dad.

1268
01:22:40,710 --> 01:22:43,010
I'm still waiting.
[sobbing]

1269
01:22:43,040 --> 01:22:46,010
I so want you to come back.

1270
01:22:46,050 --> 01:22:48,620
I want you to come back.

1271
01:22:53,790 --> 01:22:56,660
[footsteps approaching]

1272
01:22:56,690 --> 01:22:58,990
What are you doing in here?
I told you not to come in here.

1273
01:22:59,030 --> 01:23:01,300
And I told you
not to steal.

1274
01:23:01,330 --> 01:23:02,800
But I need that,
Daddy.

1275
01:23:02,830 --> 01:23:04,800
I'm sure you've convinced
yourself of that.

1276
01:23:04,830 --> 01:23:06,870
Fine.
I'll just take these.

1277
01:23:06,900 --> 01:23:08,940
That's all right.
I've got everything
backed up on disc.

1278
01:23:08,970 --> 01:23:11,040
I don't need those anymore.
Holy shit!

1279
01:23:11,070 --> 01:23:12,840
Who did you steal this from
and why?

1280
01:23:12,870 --> 01:23:14,810
I know him!
He's your patient?

1281
01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:17,680
Josie, you're not
gonna get it back.

1282
01:23:17,710 --> 01:23:19,310
Stop trying to change
the subject from yourself.

1283
01:23:19,350 --> 01:23:22,350
That's the reason
you're not getting
any better.

1284
01:23:22,380 --> 01:23:24,190
[gasps]
Oh, my God!
What?

1285
01:23:24,220 --> 01:23:25,720
Spider! Oh, my God!
In the shadows!
Where?

1286
01:23:25,750 --> 01:23:27,760
Kill it, kill it!

1287
01:23:29,930 --> 01:23:31,830
That's a nice try.

1288
01:23:31,860 --> 01:23:33,760
Give me the file.

1289
01:23:33,800 --> 01:23:37,770
Give me the file
and the box.

1290
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:39,430
I'm sorry, Dad.

1291
01:23:39,470 --> 01:23:42,800
I need to go think about
why I do what I do.

1292
01:23:42,840 --> 01:23:44,440
You better.
All right.

1293
01:23:50,910 --> 01:23:52,850
[engine starts]

1294
01:24:15,870 --> 01:24:17,810
Alex!

1295
01:24:31,290 --> 01:24:33,220
Alex!

1296
01:24:50,940 --> 01:24:53,040
[Alex]
Come back!

1297
01:24:54,940 --> 01:24:56,080
Alex?

1298
01:24:56,110 --> 01:24:58,150
[banging]

1299
01:24:58,180 --> 01:24:59,780
Holy shit!

1300
01:25:07,820 --> 01:25:10,090
Please.

1301
01:25:10,130 --> 01:25:12,190
Please come back.

1302
01:25:20,200 --> 01:25:21,970
[thudding]

1303
01:25:28,880 --> 01:25:29,980
Mom?

1304
01:25:30,010 --> 01:25:32,050
No, Josie.

1305
01:25:32,080 --> 01:25:34,450
What the hell happened?

1306
01:25:35,550 --> 01:25:37,890
You have to leave.
I have to wait for them.

1307
01:25:37,920 --> 01:25:40,120
Uh, okay, sure.

1308
01:25:40,160 --> 01:25:41,120
No!

1309
01:25:41,160 --> 01:25:43,090
No, I have to wait
for them.

1310
01:25:49,600 --> 01:25:51,970
You don't understand.
It's my fault.

1311
01:25:52,000 --> 01:25:54,540
What? No, it's not your fault.
Come on.

1312
01:25:54,570 --> 01:25:56,910
You don't know what I did.

1313
01:25:57,970 --> 01:26:00,010
You don't know.

1314
01:26:00,040 --> 01:26:02,040
I'm horrible.

1315
01:26:07,020 --> 01:26:08,880
It was an accident.

1316
01:26:09,990 --> 01:26:11,950
You know that.

1317
01:26:11,990 --> 01:26:14,460
They're not coming back.

1318
01:26:14,490 --> 01:26:17,960
The people that are coming back,
on the other hand, are psychos.

1319
01:26:17,990 --> 01:26:20,460
Okay?
Which means we need to go.

1320
01:26:20,500 --> 01:26:22,960
[car approaching]

1321
01:26:26,270 --> 01:26:28,100
[Alex]
The front door's over here.

1322
01:26:35,010 --> 01:26:37,510
[keys jingling]
They're back.

1323
01:27:13,550 --> 01:27:15,180
[Mark]
All right.
It's all set up.

1324
01:27:15,220 --> 01:27:18,090
I'll be back
to check on you
in a few minutes.

1325
01:27:19,720 --> 01:27:21,990
We were good,
weren't we?

1326
01:27:24,230 --> 01:27:26,490
Good to him?

1327
01:27:29,130 --> 01:27:31,130
What are we gonna do?

1328
01:27:35,170 --> 01:27:37,110
I'm gonna go get some boxes,

1329
01:27:37,140 --> 01:27:39,040
and you're gonna
watch Dr. Alred.

1330
01:27:39,070 --> 01:27:40,440
Honey, can't we
check the garden?

1331
01:27:40,480 --> 01:27:42,110
Alice...
Maybe he just...

1332
01:27:42,140 --> 01:27:44,010
Alice...

1333
01:27:52,750 --> 01:27:54,190
[door closes]

1334
01:27:56,360 --> 01:27:58,330
[TV on]

1335
01:27:58,360 --> 01:28:01,100
[Dr. Alred on TV]
Hello, I'm Dr. Alred.

1336
01:28:01,130 --> 01:28:03,200
This must be
a very trying time.

1337
01:28:03,230 --> 01:28:05,200
You have to remember

1338
01:28:05,230 --> 01:28:08,340
that what you're going through
is normal.

1339
01:28:08,370 --> 01:28:10,970
Anyone who encounters
such tragedy

1340
01:28:11,010 --> 01:28:13,410
goes through
these very feelings.

1341
01:28:13,440 --> 01:28:19,050
Many familiar things
will remind you of your loss,

1342
01:28:19,080 --> 01:28:22,650
but do not run
from these objects.

1343
01:28:22,680 --> 01:28:24,590
Embrace them.

1344
01:28:24,620 --> 01:28:26,590
They'll serve
as a constant reminder

1345
01:28:26,620 --> 01:28:30,590
and help keep their spirit
alive within your home,

1346
01:28:30,630 --> 01:28:33,760
even as maybe
you try to forget.

1347
01:28:33,790 --> 01:28:35,760
If you run,

1348
01:28:35,800 --> 01:28:39,500
you're erasing
their memory,

1349
01:28:39,530 --> 01:28:43,100
which is the last thing
you wanna do.

1350
01:28:49,580 --> 01:28:52,050
That's why he forgot.

1351
01:28:53,710 --> 01:28:57,050
He didn't have anything
to remember us by.

1352
01:28:57,090 --> 01:28:59,690
He needs something--

1353
01:28:59,720 --> 01:29:02,060
any-anything to help him
remember.

1354
01:29:02,090 --> 01:29:05,390
Anything before Mark
packs him away.

1355
01:29:07,160 --> 01:29:11,600
Something that he'll see
right when he comes back.

1356
01:29:21,780 --> 01:29:24,050
To leave under with him.

1357
01:29:32,850 --> 01:29:35,190
There needs to be
no doubt.

1358
01:29:37,360 --> 01:29:40,060
[chuckles]

1359
01:29:40,100 --> 01:29:41,600
The cake.

1360
01:29:44,230 --> 01:29:46,500
He would never forget
his own nose.

1361
01:29:48,500 --> 01:29:50,110
Um...

1362
01:30:04,590 --> 01:30:07,360
This is perfect.

1363
01:30:07,390 --> 01:30:09,120
What else?

1364
01:30:09,160 --> 01:30:11,660
What else, what else
what else, what else?

1365
01:30:14,560 --> 01:30:16,130
Okay.

1366
01:30:27,710 --> 01:30:31,150
Mark, he's back!
Get out here!

1367
01:30:31,180 --> 01:30:33,150
[door opens]
[Mark]
What's wrong?

1368
01:30:33,180 --> 01:30:35,280
[Alice]
Nothing. Everything's right.

1369
01:30:35,320 --> 01:30:37,690
Guard the front door.
He might be scared.

1370
01:30:37,720 --> 01:30:40,560
What are you talking about?
He's back! He's come back!

1371
01:30:40,590 --> 01:30:43,560
On the same day!
He-He came back for the cake!

1372
01:30:43,590 --> 01:30:46,560
I was slicing a piece
so that he would have
something to remember,

1373
01:30:46,590 --> 01:30:48,730
which is what
we didn't do before.

1374
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:51,300
Alice--Alice, stop.
No! N-No!

1375
01:30:51,330 --> 01:30:53,300
Go! Go look yourself!

1376
01:30:53,330 --> 01:30:55,270
Go on.

1377
01:30:55,300 --> 01:30:57,540
[sniffling]

1378
01:30:57,570 --> 01:31:00,280
Timmy? Honey?

1379
01:31:00,310 --> 01:31:03,410
Come on out.
Don't be scared.

1380
01:31:03,440 --> 01:31:05,580
We're your parents.
That's right.

1381
01:31:05,610 --> 01:31:09,180
Your-- Your mom
and your dad.

1382
01:31:10,250 --> 01:31:13,650
Timmy, honey,
where are you?

1383
01:31:15,290 --> 01:31:17,830
He was dead.
He was dead.

1384
01:31:17,860 --> 01:31:20,200
No, not for us.

1385
01:31:21,260 --> 01:31:23,200
Well, where is he?

1386
01:31:23,230 --> 01:31:24,670
I'm gonna go
and check out back,

1387
01:31:24,700 --> 01:31:26,770
and you stay
by the door.

1388
01:31:28,700 --> 01:31:30,370
Timmy?

1389
01:31:30,410 --> 01:31:34,840
Timmy? Timmy?

1390
01:31:35,910 --> 01:31:37,880
Timmy.

1391
01:31:40,820 --> 01:31:43,550
The hall.
We can get out a back window.

1392
01:31:45,990 --> 01:31:48,590
Timmy.

1393
01:31:50,890 --> 01:31:53,890
What's wrong with your feet?
Nothing. I'm fine.

1394
01:31:53,930 --> 01:31:56,200
[door opens]
[Alice]
Timmy?

1395
01:31:58,300 --> 01:32:00,240
Timmy?

1396
01:32:00,270 --> 01:32:02,300
Where?
[door closes]

1397
01:32:02,340 --> 01:32:03,900
The closet.

1398
01:32:13,350 --> 01:32:15,320
She won't look in here?

1399
01:32:15,350 --> 01:32:18,220
Mark won't let her.
He says that this is his place.

1400
01:32:19,620 --> 01:32:23,820
Come on out, honey.
It's Mom.

1401
01:32:25,890 --> 01:32:28,660
Timmy, sweetie,
where are you?

1402
01:32:28,700 --> 01:32:30,930
Come on, honey.

1403
01:32:30,970 --> 01:32:34,670
Quit playing around.
Stop hiding from me.

1404
01:32:36,670 --> 01:32:38,870
Timmy, this isn't
funny anymore.

1405
01:32:38,910 --> 01:32:40,740
We're getting scared.

1406
01:32:40,780 --> 01:32:43,410
Maybe we should look
down the street.
He might've left.

1407
01:32:43,440 --> 01:32:46,310
No, he is in this house.
I know it.

1408
01:32:46,350 --> 01:32:48,780
Timmy, I don't wanna punish you
on your first day back,

1409
01:32:48,820 --> 01:32:51,350
but if you're not out here
by the time I count to five,

1410
01:32:51,390 --> 01:32:53,450
then you have only
yourself to blame.

1411
01:32:53,490 --> 01:32:56,290
One,

1412
01:32:56,320 --> 01:32:57,830
two,

1413
01:32:57,860 --> 01:32:59,390
three,

1414
01:32:59,430 --> 01:33:00,700
four...

1415
01:33:00,730 --> 01:33:03,530
Timmy, come out right now!

1416
01:33:04,700 --> 01:33:08,500
Oh, my God! He's hurt!

1417
01:33:11,970 --> 01:33:14,610
That's why he's not coming out.
He's too hurt.

1418
01:33:15,680 --> 01:33:17,310
[door opens]

1419
01:33:23,520 --> 01:33:24,950
Timmy?

1420
01:33:26,850 --> 01:33:28,320
Honey?

1421
01:33:29,460 --> 01:33:31,730
Do you remember
what this place is?

1422
01:33:32,790 --> 01:33:35,830
It's your father's office.

1423
01:33:35,860 --> 01:33:39,470
He works from here because
we wanted to be home
when you came back.

1424
01:33:45,840 --> 01:33:47,910
Timmy, open up.

1425
01:33:50,950 --> 01:33:53,450
Honey, I know you're hurt.

1426
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:55,650
I just wanna help you.
I wanna make you feel better.

1427
01:33:55,680 --> 01:34:00,050
I'm your mother.
That's what moms do.

1428
01:34:00,090 --> 01:34:03,860
We would never have left
if we knew you were gonna
come back so soon.

1429
01:34:06,460 --> 01:34:09,400
I'm sorry, Mom.
[whispers]
Oh, my God.

1430
01:34:10,530 --> 01:34:13,370
Oh, honey.

1431
01:34:15,070 --> 01:34:17,970
We're not mad at you.

1432
01:34:18,010 --> 01:34:20,340
Just open the door.

1433
01:34:23,410 --> 01:34:24,980
Timmy!

1434
01:34:27,880 --> 01:34:29,780
Open up now!

1435
01:34:29,820 --> 01:34:31,120
[bangs on door]

1436
01:34:31,150 --> 01:34:33,050
All right. Then we're
gonna do it the hard way.

1437
01:34:33,090 --> 01:34:34,720
Mark, give me the keys
to your office.

1438
01:34:34,760 --> 01:34:36,420
Give them to me.
Alice, please.

1439
01:34:36,460 --> 01:34:38,060
Timmy!

1440
01:34:38,090 --> 01:34:39,890
Timmy, open the door!

1441
01:34:39,930 --> 01:34:41,730
Timmy!

1442
01:34:41,760 --> 01:34:43,400
Mark, hurry up.

1443
01:34:43,430 --> 01:34:44,870
Alice...

1444
01:34:58,810 --> 01:35:00,550
Honey,

1445
01:35:00,580 --> 01:35:03,920
you don't need
to hide anymore.

1446
01:35:03,950 --> 01:35:07,120
I'm here,
and so is your father.

1447
01:35:09,460 --> 01:35:12,660
He hung up all these
clippings for you.

1448
01:35:12,690 --> 01:35:15,130
That's how much
he loves you.

1449
01:35:19,430 --> 01:35:21,640
I know you have
a lot of questions.

1450
01:35:21,670 --> 01:35:25,540
I'm gonna try and answer them
better than before.

1451
01:35:26,670 --> 01:35:28,480
Timmy...

1452
01:35:30,480 --> 01:35:32,110
[screams]

1453
01:35:32,150 --> 01:35:34,920
Alice? Alice?
[door opens]

1454
01:35:36,950 --> 01:35:38,920
Sit me down.

1455
01:35:38,950 --> 01:35:40,920
[Alice]
He's got someone with him!

1456
01:35:40,960 --> 01:35:42,560
She's strong.

1457
01:35:42,590 --> 01:35:44,590
Stealing from us.

1458
01:35:44,630 --> 01:35:46,590
Timmy, who is this?
Do you know her?

1459
01:35:46,630 --> 01:35:48,600
Yeah, she's my friend, Josie.

1460
01:35:48,630 --> 01:35:50,600
You--You don't know
a Josie.

1461
01:35:50,630 --> 01:35:52,970
You never knew a Josie.
He knows me.

1462
01:35:53,000 --> 01:35:54,800
You did this to him.
You ruined him.

1463
01:35:54,840 --> 01:35:56,670
You were the first person
he saw.

1464
01:35:56,700 --> 01:35:59,810
Timmy,
you don't know her.

1465
01:35:59,840 --> 01:36:01,980
You know me
and your father.

1466
01:36:02,010 --> 01:36:03,710
You're not his parents.

1467
01:36:03,740 --> 01:36:05,710
Tell them what happened
to your parents, Alex.

1468
01:36:05,750 --> 01:36:07,580
Nothing happened.
Nothing happened to them.

1469
01:36:07,620 --> 01:36:09,050
He just doesn't remember us.

1470
01:36:09,080 --> 01:36:10,690
Tell her, Alex.
He just doesn't
remember us.

1471
01:36:10,720 --> 01:36:12,490
Tell her, Alex!

1472
01:36:12,520 --> 01:36:15,190
I think it is time
for you to leave.

1473
01:36:16,990 --> 01:36:19,490
They le--

1474
01:36:19,530 --> 01:36:21,460
They left.

1475
01:36:22,930 --> 01:36:25,600
They were looking
for me.

1476
01:36:27,540 --> 01:36:31,040
If I...hadn't left,

1477
01:36:32,670 --> 01:36:34,710
they wouldn't have died.

1478
01:36:38,550 --> 01:36:40,950
But it wasn't my fault.

1479
01:36:40,980 --> 01:36:44,020
It was-- It wasn't...

1480
01:36:44,050 --> 01:36:46,090
It wasn't my fault.

1481
01:36:47,560 --> 01:36:50,220
[Mark]
That's why
you told Alice

1482
01:36:50,260 --> 01:36:52,230
that you couldn't
remember them?

1483
01:36:52,260 --> 01:36:54,860
That's not it, Mark.
Is that why?

1484
01:36:54,900 --> 01:36:57,800
It's because you
filled his head with that.

1485
01:36:57,830 --> 01:37:00,870
She was there when we--
when we weren't.

1486
01:37:00,900 --> 01:37:03,600
We should've been there
for him.

1487
01:37:03,640 --> 01:37:06,540
We should've been there for...

1488
01:37:06,570 --> 01:37:09,080
But we are now,
and that is what is important.

1489
01:37:09,110 --> 01:37:12,980
Remember who you are,
not what she tells you to.

1490
01:37:14,050 --> 01:37:17,550
See? His name is Alex.

1491
01:37:17,590 --> 01:37:21,160
Tell her, Alex.
Tell her why you came here.

1492
01:37:21,190 --> 01:37:23,090
You saw her, right?
You followed them.

1493
01:37:23,120 --> 01:37:26,090
No, no, no.
You stole him from me.

1494
01:37:26,130 --> 01:37:28,530
I work at the library.

1495
01:37:28,560 --> 01:37:30,530
You come in all the time.
I saw you there,

1496
01:37:30,570 --> 01:37:34,030
and you saw me once,
watching you.

1497
01:37:34,070 --> 01:37:36,670
I tried telling you.
[Alice]
No, no, no, no, no.

1498
01:37:36,700 --> 01:37:37,740
I did.

1499
01:37:37,770 --> 01:37:38,710
No.

1500
01:37:40,780 --> 01:37:43,040
Timmy, if you don't remember...

1501
01:37:46,050 --> 01:37:48,180
then I have to start all over

1502
01:37:48,220 --> 01:37:50,120
and show you things
to help you remember,

1503
01:37:50,150 --> 01:37:51,690
and I don't wanna do that.

1504
01:37:54,190 --> 01:37:56,890
Please don't make me do that.

1505
01:37:56,920 --> 01:37:59,660
Please remember.

1506
01:38:01,160 --> 01:38:03,230
Don't make me do that, Timmy!

1507
01:38:08,140 --> 01:38:09,600
Come on.

1508
01:38:09,640 --> 01:38:11,270
[Alice]
No!

1509
01:38:11,310 --> 01:38:14,710
What are you doing?
You're letting him leave!

1510
01:38:14,740 --> 01:38:17,650
His keys!
What do you take me for?

1511
01:38:17,680 --> 01:38:19,650
No! No! No!
Let me go!

1512
01:38:19,680 --> 01:38:22,220
What are you doing?
You're letting him leave!

1513
01:38:22,250 --> 01:38:24,220
Timmy! He's leaving!

1514
01:38:24,250 --> 01:38:26,890
Let me go!
Timmy! Honey!

1515
01:38:26,920 --> 01:38:28,890
Stay! It's-- It's okay!

1516
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:31,130
It's okay. Stay.

1517
01:38:31,160 --> 01:38:34,600
[Alice sobbing]

1518
01:38:34,630 --> 01:38:36,630
[engine starts]

1519
01:38:37,930 --> 01:38:39,630
Baby!

1520
01:38:39,670 --> 01:38:42,170
[car departing]

1521
01:38:47,780 --> 01:38:49,810
Our son is gone.

1522
01:38:52,110 --> 01:38:53,750
Our son is gone.

1523
01:38:53,780 --> 01:38:56,720
[sobbing continues]
