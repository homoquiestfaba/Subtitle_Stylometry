1
00:00:01,290 --> 00:00:02,230
The following film

2
00:00:02,231 --> 00:00:04,409
is based on court records, interviews,

3
00:00:04,410 --> 00:00:06,009
and the book False Arrest.

4
00:00:06,010 --> 00:00:08,783
Some names, characters, and
scenes have been changed.

5
00:00:53,940 --> 00:00:55,959
Hey.

6
00:00:55,960 --> 00:00:57,133
We missed you, baby.

7
00:01:14,998 --> 00:01:15,831
Whatcha got?

8
00:01:15,832 --> 00:01:17,013
Shut up.

9
00:01:23,520 --> 00:01:24,353
Guns.

10
00:01:24,354 --> 00:01:26,539
I don't like guns.

11
00:01:26,540 --> 00:01:27,583
That's okay, baby.

12
00:01:29,344 --> 00:01:31,843
We'll just use a knife then, eh?

13
00:02:44,937 --> 00:02:46,913
You really have to push these guys.

14
00:02:48,179 --> 00:02:51,149
I don't care what the
competition is bidding.

15
00:02:51,150 --> 00:02:53,100
Hold on a second, Jason turn that down.

16
00:02:54,870 --> 00:02:57,561
Jason, Eden.

17
00:02:57,562 --> 00:02:58,550
Yeah, Mom.

18
00:02:58,551 --> 00:03:01,270
Honey, turn Jason's
TV down, I can't hear.

19
00:03:04,353 --> 00:03:05,186
Let me turn this down.

20
00:03:05,187 --> 00:03:06,919
Hey, don't touch that!

21
00:03:06,920 --> 00:03:08,230
Stop it, just a little bit.

22
00:03:08,231 --> 00:03:09,289
I'm watching that!

23
00:03:09,290 --> 00:03:11,045
- Why don't we with Fidelity.
- Stop!

24
00:03:11,046 --> 00:03:12,129
In January.

25
00:03:13,380 --> 00:03:14,213
Come on, Jason.

26
00:03:14,214 --> 00:03:15,407
We can work
this out, we're free.

27
00:03:15,408 --> 00:03:16,698
- Your mother can't hear.
- Ron!

28
00:03:16,699 --> 00:03:18,839
Your news makes noise, too!

29
00:03:18,840 --> 00:03:19,886
That's my show.

30
00:03:19,887 --> 00:03:21,359
That's his favorite show, Ron.

31
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:23,144
- Much worse.
- Okay, okay.

32
00:03:23,145 --> 00:03:25,433
Just tryin' to help.

33
00:03:25,434 --> 00:03:27,409
Look, why don't we talk about this

34
00:03:27,410 --> 00:03:29,554
when I get to the office?

35
00:03:31,370 --> 00:03:32,873
All right, I'll see you in a bit.

36
00:03:32,874 --> 00:03:34,495
Bye bye.

37
00:03:34,496 --> 00:03:35,663
Jason.

38
00:03:44,282 --> 00:03:45,619
What is that?

39
00:03:45,620 --> 00:03:47,614
Good morning to you, too.

40
00:03:47,615 --> 00:03:51,609
And what time did you roll in last night?

41
00:03:51,610 --> 00:03:52,760
Always such a mother.

42
00:03:54,060 --> 00:03:55,269
Honey.

43
00:03:55,270 --> 00:03:56,240
Push your hair back.

44
00:03:56,241 --> 00:03:58,446
I don't like it when it's
in your eyes like that.

45
00:03:58,447 --> 00:04:00,683
Have some orange juice, Eric.

46
00:04:05,360 --> 00:04:06,460
How's the band coming?

47
00:04:07,730 --> 00:04:10,259
When do we get to hear you guys play?

48
00:04:10,260 --> 00:04:11,260
I don't know.

49
00:04:12,110 --> 00:04:14,629
It's not your kind of music anyway, Ron.

50
00:04:14,630 --> 00:04:16,200
Not my kind of music, huh?

51
00:04:18,090 --> 00:04:19,423
What is my kind of music?

52
00:04:23,100 --> 00:04:24,100
Beats me.

53
00:04:35,430 --> 00:04:36,263
- Oh, Toni.
- Yes.

54
00:04:36,264 --> 00:04:37,689
Will you make a tuna casserole

55
00:04:37,690 --> 00:04:38,650
for the kids tonight?

56
00:04:38,650 --> 00:04:39,560
Tuna again?

57
00:04:39,561 --> 00:04:42,209
I know, it's New Year's,
but that's what they want.

58
00:04:42,210 --> 00:04:43,339
And don't forget a salad.

59
00:04:43,340 --> 00:04:44,619
Do I ever forget salad?

60
00:04:44,620 --> 00:04:46,073
Never, bye.

61
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,589
I'm trying, Joyce, I'm really trying.

62
00:04:50,590 --> 00:04:51,849
The kid hates my guts.

63
00:04:51,850 --> 00:04:53,309
He's just being careful.

64
00:04:53,310 --> 00:04:54,539
Give him time.

65
00:04:54,540 --> 00:04:56,259
Sure, like maybe another five years?

66
00:04:56,260 --> 00:04:59,329
Maybe after 10 years, he
could work up to a hello

67
00:04:59,330 --> 00:05:00,499
or a good morning.

68
00:05:00,500 --> 00:05:02,479
You're making a big deal out of nothing.

69
00:05:02,480 --> 00:05:04,499
The kids love you.

70
00:05:04,500 --> 00:05:05,609
I love you.

71
00:05:05,610 --> 00:05:06,749
I'm trying.

72
00:05:06,750 --> 00:05:08,359
I know you are.

73
00:05:08,360 --> 00:05:09,810
And you're doing a great job.

74
00:05:13,070 --> 00:05:14,113
Is that all I get?

75
00:05:14,968 --> 00:05:19,335
Mm.

76
00:05:26,220 --> 00:05:27,147
Don't forget the party tonight.

77
00:05:27,148 --> 00:05:28,779
I'm gonna start early.

78
00:05:28,780 --> 00:05:31,084
One for Kathy and one for Arthur.

79
00:05:43,310 --> 00:05:44,143
Where you going?

80
00:05:44,143 --> 00:05:45,143
Nowhere.

81
00:05:46,365 --> 00:05:49,059
Hey, how about my 50 bucks?

82
00:05:49,060 --> 00:05:50,093
We'll be back.

83
00:06:08,270 --> 00:06:10,119
Okay, put your shirt back on,

84
00:06:10,120 --> 00:06:13,436
and Susie will give you the forms to sign.

85
00:06:13,437 --> 00:06:15,726
Well, it's right on this chart.

86
00:06:15,727 --> 00:06:18,377
I had it before.

87
00:06:18,378 --> 00:06:19,289
Morning.

88
00:06:19,290 --> 00:06:21,085
Early in the day for that.

89
00:06:21,086 --> 00:06:23,849
One for you, Happy New Year.

90
00:06:23,850 --> 00:06:26,739
- Thank you.
- And for my darling brother.

91
00:06:26,740 --> 00:06:28,474
Hey, you want some good news?

92
00:06:28,475 --> 00:06:29,753
Madison?

93
00:06:31,000 --> 00:06:33,429
200 physicals minimum guaranteed.

94
00:06:33,430 --> 00:06:35,829
Oh, all right!

95
00:06:35,830 --> 00:06:38,859
Oh, thank god, I was about
to offer them your body.

96
00:06:38,860 --> 00:06:40,999
My body, thank you very much.

97
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:43,989
Oh, also, Arizona is putting
out a new contract for bids,

98
00:06:43,990 --> 00:06:45,919
physicals for state-owned daycare centers.

99
00:06:45,920 --> 00:06:48,079
Oh, I'll get on that right away.

100
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:50,119
As soon as I run this over to Arthur.

101
00:06:50,120 --> 00:06:51,220
Hey partner.

102
00:06:52,770 --> 00:06:55,603
Partner!

103
00:07:04,343 --> 00:07:05,499
- Hey!
- Hi, honey.

104
00:07:05,500 --> 00:07:06,440
- How are you?
- Happy New Year!

105
00:07:06,441 --> 00:07:08,249
- Is this for me?
- Yes, it is.

106
00:07:08,250 --> 00:07:10,134
Oh, you're such a sweetheart.

107
00:07:10,135 --> 00:07:11,725
- Thank you.
- Hi, Bobby.

108
00:07:11,726 --> 00:07:13,940
- Thank you, honey.
- Hey, Joycie.

109
00:07:13,941 --> 00:07:15,009
When's that husband of yours

110
00:07:15,010 --> 00:07:16,419
gonna let me make him a millionaire?

111
00:07:16,420 --> 00:07:17,889
We're workin' on it, Bobby.

112
00:07:17,890 --> 00:07:20,706
Hey, I got investors
lining up around the block.

113
00:07:20,707 --> 00:07:22,951
Happy New Year to you and your family.

114
00:07:22,952 --> 00:07:24,379
- Thank you.
- Thank you, Bobby.

115
00:07:24,380 --> 00:07:25,380
We'll see ya.

116
00:07:26,482 --> 00:07:27,315
Guess what?

117
00:07:27,315 --> 00:07:28,300
What?

118
00:07:28,301 --> 00:07:31,179
We landed the
Madison Insurance account.

119
00:07:31,180 --> 00:07:32,769
I love it!

120
00:07:32,770 --> 00:07:34,619
My sister, the tycoon!

121
00:07:34,620 --> 00:07:36,229
- Yep!
- Ah, so?

122
00:07:36,230 --> 00:07:37,063
What?

123
00:07:37,064 --> 00:07:38,125
The loan will be repaid on schedule?

124
00:07:38,126 --> 00:07:40,953
Oh, what are you putting
the muscle on your own sister?

125
00:07:40,954 --> 00:07:42,743
Business is business.

126
00:07:47,225 --> 00:07:50,434
And we are going
after a state contract next.

127
00:07:50,435 --> 00:07:51,951
- You're on a roll.
- Mm-hm.

128
00:07:51,952 --> 00:07:53,643
You're gonna be proud of me.

129
00:07:54,930 --> 00:07:56,980
I'm already very proud of you.

130
00:08:05,990 --> 00:08:08,043
Hey Arnie!

131
00:08:09,302 --> 00:08:10,402
Eh, what do you think?

132
00:08:12,163 --> 00:08:15,109
This is what you brought
me here for, Bobby?

133
00:08:15,110 --> 00:08:16,026
Rugs?

134
00:08:16,027 --> 00:08:17,709
Carpets, Arnie.

135
00:08:17,710 --> 00:08:19,849
Genuine Persian carpets.

136
00:08:19,850 --> 00:08:22,491
They go for 6,500 a piece.

137
00:08:22,492 --> 00:08:25,009
Carpets, rugs, what the
hell is the difference?

138
00:08:25,010 --> 00:08:26,319
They're old.

139
00:08:26,320 --> 00:08:28,577
Sure they're old, that's
the way they like 'em.

140
00:08:28,578 --> 00:08:29,829
And I want you to peddle 'em for me.

141
00:08:29,830 --> 00:08:32,069
Oh yeah, no problem.

142
00:08:32,070 --> 00:08:34,769
A lot of my friends pay 65 for an old rug.

143
00:08:34,770 --> 00:08:36,653
Excuse me, carpet.

144
00:08:38,330 --> 00:08:41,338
Arnie, I'm gonna give you
the names of some buyers.

145
00:08:41,339 --> 00:08:42,593
It'll be no problem.

146
00:08:44,203 --> 00:08:46,699
Joycie, baby, ooh,
you're lookin' good mama.

147
00:08:46,700 --> 00:08:47,929
You are lookin' good.

148
00:08:47,930 --> 00:08:48,763
Oh, Arnie.

149
00:08:48,764 --> 00:08:50,159
I thought maybe you and
I could go out for a drink

150
00:08:50,160 --> 00:08:51,244
after work, how's that sound?

151
00:08:51,245 --> 00:08:53,156
Arnie, it's New Year's Eve.

152
00:08:53,157 --> 00:08:56,139
You know, family, friends, Guy Lombardo,

153
00:08:56,140 --> 00:08:57,399
any of that ring a bell?

154
00:08:57,400 --> 00:08:59,167
I was thinkin' of
another New Year's Eve.

155
00:08:59,168 --> 00:09:00,001
We didn't need no Guy Lombardo, eh?

156
00:09:00,002 --> 00:09:01,733
Arnie, don't touch me!

157
00:09:03,250 --> 00:09:04,083
She's crazy about me, eh?

158
00:09:04,084 --> 00:09:05,959
We used to be an item, Joyce and me.

159
00:09:05,960 --> 00:09:09,489
Once, we had one date once
when we were 17 years old.

160
00:09:09,490 --> 00:09:11,229
He's still 17.

161
00:09:11,230 --> 00:09:14,052
Oh, you don't know what
you're missin', Joycie babe.

162
00:09:14,053 --> 00:09:15,203
I think I do.

163
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:22,079
Oh.

164
00:09:25,926 --> 00:09:27,383
Ha!

165
00:09:33,928 --> 00:09:34,928
Good.

166
00:09:48,910 --> 00:09:50,667
He crazy, you know that?

167
00:09:50,668 --> 00:09:53,038
Hey!

168
00:09:55,280 --> 00:09:56,336
Everyone.

169
00:09:56,337 --> 00:09:57,823
Everyone, come on over.

170
00:09:59,030 --> 00:10:00,679
Pat, come on up here.

171
00:10:00,680 --> 00:10:02,409
Pat and I wanna thank
each and every one of you

172
00:10:02,410 --> 00:10:04,199
for making this the most successful year

173
00:10:04,200 --> 00:10:06,454
in the history of Graphics Dimension.

174
00:10:06,455 --> 00:10:08,659
We're the fastest growing printing company

175
00:10:08,660 --> 00:10:11,079
in the Southwest, and you've
done one hell of a job.

176
00:10:11,080 --> 00:10:12,530
Hi, Sherry.

177
00:10:12,531 --> 00:10:15,009
We are solid, we are stable,

178
00:10:15,010 --> 00:10:17,959
we have formed a firm
foundation for the future.

179
00:10:17,960 --> 00:10:19,730
And the best is yet to come, cheers!

180
00:10:23,005 --> 00:10:24,289
Hi, honey.

181
00:10:24,290 --> 00:10:25,625
- Let me get you a glass.
- Okay.

182
00:10:25,626 --> 00:10:26,809
Looks like a good party.

183
00:10:26,810 --> 00:10:28,449
- Marilyn.
- Hi.

184
00:10:28,450 --> 00:10:29,416
Champagne?

185
00:10:29,417 --> 00:10:31,127
Yes, thank you.

186
00:10:31,128 --> 00:10:32,339
- Excuse me.
- Okay.

187
00:10:32,340 --> 00:10:33,941
Oh, that's a gorgeous outfit, Joyce.

188
00:10:33,942 --> 00:10:34,775
You look trim.

189
00:10:34,776 --> 00:10:36,580
Thank you, you look wonderful, too.

190
00:10:46,880 --> 00:10:47,713
Hey, Wally.

191
00:10:47,714 --> 00:10:49,413
Hey, Joycie.

192
00:10:49,414 --> 00:10:50,247
Happy New Year.

193
00:10:50,247 --> 00:10:51,080
Do you believe it?

194
00:10:51,080 --> 00:10:52,080
1991.

195
00:10:52,924 --> 00:10:54,512
You know what, Wally?

196
00:10:54,513 --> 00:10:56,596
You are the best designer I know.

197
00:10:56,597 --> 00:10:57,633
Thank you.

198
00:11:00,220 --> 00:11:01,969
I just can't help thinking
how much better you'd be

199
00:11:01,970 --> 00:11:04,703
if you didn't fry your
brains on this stuff.

200
00:11:06,930 --> 00:11:09,303
Hey, Joyce, it's a party.

201
00:11:20,900 --> 00:11:23,109
Don't you see how big this is?

202
00:11:23,110 --> 00:11:25,106
Opportunity doesn't come along this often.

203
00:11:25,939 --> 00:11:28,049
And this deal could
change our whole lives.

204
00:11:28,050 --> 00:11:31,509
Look, hype our clients all
you want, don't do it to me.

205
00:11:31,510 --> 00:11:34,499
I'm offering you half the
chips in the biggest game

206
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:36,259
you ever had a chance
to sit in in your life.

207
00:11:36,260 --> 00:11:37,959
The chance for big money.

208
00:11:37,960 --> 00:11:39,184
Seven figures.

209
00:11:39,185 --> 00:11:41,929
Were those Vegas guys holding the cards?

210
00:11:41,930 --> 00:11:43,738
I don't like that game, Ronnie.

211
00:11:44,571 --> 00:11:45,659
If we something wrong,

212
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,429
they don't take us to court and sue us.

213
00:11:47,430 --> 00:11:48,969
They call in the Louisville Slugger

214
00:11:48,970 --> 00:11:50,549
and they break our knees.

215
00:11:50,550 --> 00:11:53,229
Why do you wanna pass up
an opportunity like this?

216
00:11:53,230 --> 00:11:54,949
Pat, trust me.

217
00:11:54,950 --> 00:11:57,329
I've always done right by you.

218
00:11:57,330 --> 00:11:59,280
This is the time to take the next step.

219
00:12:03,330 --> 00:12:05,108
Come on, let's have some champagne.

220
00:12:05,109 --> 00:12:05,970
Come on.

221
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:06,803
Come on.

222
00:12:06,804 --> 00:12:09,668
No, I gotta think
about this, you guys go.

223
00:12:27,034 --> 00:12:28,443
What are you guys gonna do?

224
00:12:29,783 --> 00:12:31,616
Don't ask questions.

225
00:12:35,023 --> 00:12:36,199
I don't like this.

226
00:12:36,200 --> 00:12:37,170
20 minutes, let's move.

227
00:12:37,171 --> 00:12:38,599
Just put on somethin' sexy.

228
00:12:38,600 --> 00:12:41,050
We're gonna be wanting to
party when we get back.

229
00:13:03,347 --> 00:13:05,119
You gotta trust your instincts, honey.

230
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,239
If it doesn't feel right to you,

231
00:13:06,240 --> 00:13:07,955
you shouldn't take a chance on it.

232
00:13:09,020 --> 00:13:11,089
Ron has done a great job.

233
00:13:11,090 --> 00:13:12,249
The business is taking off,

234
00:13:12,250 --> 00:13:14,969
I can't fault him for wanting to be rich.

235
00:13:14,970 --> 00:13:17,023
I'm happy with the way we live now.

236
00:13:17,024 --> 00:13:17,950
Who needs the aggravation?

237
00:13:17,951 --> 00:13:20,489
Did you get the cards ready?

238
00:13:20,490 --> 00:13:21,579
I laid 'em out, Mom.

239
00:13:21,580 --> 00:13:23,677
Ooh, I better get some quarters.

240
00:13:25,784 --> 00:13:26,951
I'll get it.

241
00:13:29,255 --> 00:13:31,922
Oh, napkins, napkins, napkins.

242
00:13:35,253 --> 00:13:36,629
Good evening, sir.

243
00:13:36,630 --> 00:13:38,139
I'm sorry to bother you.

244
00:13:38,140 --> 00:13:39,090
Ooh.

245
00:13:39,091 --> 00:13:41,439
Uh, anything wrong, officer?

246
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:42,639
Well, we're doing some
checking on a person

247
00:13:42,640 --> 00:13:43,939
that has been seen in this neighborhood.

248
00:13:43,940 --> 00:13:45,439
We were wondering if you
might've noticed something

249
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:47,339
that could be of help to us.

250
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:48,649
Whatever you need.

251
00:13:48,650 --> 00:13:50,039
May I come in?

252
00:13:50,040 --> 00:13:51,619
What did this person do?

253
00:13:51,620 --> 00:13:53,589
If I could just come in, sir.

254
00:13:53,590 --> 00:13:54,590
Sure, come on in.

255
00:14:00,236 --> 00:14:01,873
Don't say a word.

256
00:14:08,185 --> 00:14:11,209
Oh, dear.

257
00:14:11,210 --> 00:14:13,180
You call your wife.

258
00:14:13,181 --> 00:14:14,593
Like hell I will.

259
00:14:16,760 --> 00:14:18,953
You call her, or
we'll get her ourselves.

260
00:14:20,598 --> 00:14:22,890
- Marilyn.
- Yeah?

261
00:14:22,891 --> 00:14:24,293
Come in here.

262
00:14:27,193 --> 00:14:28,600
Come on, lady.

263
00:14:28,601 --> 00:14:30,339
It's all right.

264
00:14:30,340 --> 00:14:31,969
Who else is here?

265
00:14:31,970 --> 00:14:33,743
Uh, just her mother.

266
00:14:34,710 --> 00:14:35,739
She's in the den.

267
00:14:35,740 --> 00:14:36,936
Get her.

268
00:14:36,937 --> 00:14:38,273
Move, damn it.

269
00:14:42,450 --> 00:14:43,884
Hey, come on.

270
00:14:43,885 --> 00:14:44,898
Take her.

271
00:14:44,899 --> 00:14:47,147
Hands behind your back.

272
00:14:47,148 --> 00:14:48,648
Just take it easy.

273
00:14:50,788 --> 00:14:52,048
Stay back there, lady.

274
00:14:52,049 --> 00:14:53,647
Mother,
Mother, we're being robbed.

275
00:14:54,480 --> 00:14:55,754
Mother please, do what they say.

276
00:14:55,755 --> 00:14:56,987
- Pat!
- What do you guys want?

277
00:14:56,988 --> 00:14:59,206
Cash and jewelry, where is it?

278
00:14:59,207 --> 00:15:01,498
I've bot a couple
hundred bucks in my wallet.

279
00:15:01,499 --> 00:15:02,652
It's in the bedroom, I'll show you.

280
00:15:02,653 --> 00:15:03,736
Move, move.

281
00:15:05,205 --> 00:15:07,609
- What do you want?
- Let's go, go, go.

282
00:15:07,610 --> 00:15:09,294
Here, here, please, please,

283
00:15:09,295 --> 00:15:10,328
take my earrings.

284
00:15:10,329 --> 00:15:12,397
Take my ear...
Come on, gimme the bracelet.

285
00:15:12,398 --> 00:15:14,725
- Give the bracelet.
- My keys are on the string.

286
00:15:14,726 --> 00:15:16,487
Get in there, get on the floor.

287
00:15:16,488 --> 00:15:18,051
- Please don't hurt me,
- Get down, on you knees!

288
00:15:18,052 --> 00:15:18,930
Do it, do it.

289
00:15:18,931 --> 00:15:20,208
- Don't hurt us, please.
- Head down.

290
00:15:20,209 --> 00:15:22,029
You say there's cash, where is it?

291
00:15:22,030 --> 00:15:22,990
It's in the drawer there.

292
00:15:22,991 --> 00:15:24,340
It's on the left-hand side.

293
00:15:28,790 --> 00:15:30,849
Hey, you people are supposed to be rich.

294
00:15:30,850 --> 00:15:31,980
Where's the gold?

295
00:15:31,981 --> 00:15:33,109
- Here, there's my diamond.
- Say there's money,

296
00:15:33,110 --> 00:15:34,491
we know you got money, where's the safe?

297
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,836
We don't have a safe.

298
00:15:35,837 --> 00:15:37,759
We were robbed about two years ago.

299
00:15:37,760 --> 00:15:40,066
We have a safety deposit box in the bank.

300
00:15:40,067 --> 00:15:41,599
Please take my diamond ring.

301
00:15:41,600 --> 00:15:43,538
Man, this stuff is garbage.

302
00:15:43,539 --> 00:15:46,956
Look, we don't need these people no more.

303
00:15:52,812 --> 00:15:54,841
No, no, don't!

304
00:16:16,990 --> 00:16:17,990
Hello?

305
00:16:18,898 --> 00:16:20,563
Yes?

306
00:16:23,620 --> 00:16:24,620
Oh my god.

307
00:16:25,800 --> 00:16:27,364
What is it?

308
00:16:27,365 --> 00:16:29,133
How, what happened?

309
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,586
Who is it, what's going on?

310
00:16:35,587 --> 00:16:37,263
We'll be right there.

311
00:17:02,720 --> 00:17:04,284
Ron Lukezic, we're
friends of the family.

312
00:17:04,285 --> 00:17:05,317
It's all right.

313
00:17:05,318 --> 00:17:07,854
Mr. and Mrs. Lukezic, I'm Lt. Martinson.

314
00:17:07,855 --> 00:17:09,999
All they would tell me on the phone

315
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,709
was that an emergency, what happened?

316
00:17:11,710 --> 00:17:13,523
There was a break in.

317
00:17:14,430 --> 00:17:16,422
What about Pat and
Marilyn, are they all right?

318
00:17:16,423 --> 00:17:17,723
No, they aren't.

319
00:17:18,590 --> 00:17:19,423
I'm sorry to say.

320
00:17:19,424 --> 00:17:23,187
Mr. Redmond and Mrs.
Redmond's mother are dead.

321
00:17:23,188 --> 00:17:24,188
Oh my god.

322
00:17:25,462 --> 00:17:26,633
I can't believe this.

323
00:17:28,360 --> 00:17:30,494
We were just with them this afternoon.

324
00:17:30,495 --> 00:17:31,799
What about Marilyn?

325
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:32,800
Is she all right?

326
00:17:34,998 --> 00:17:36,619
Mrs. Redmond's in the hospital.

327
00:17:36,620 --> 00:17:38,820
We don't know if she's
gonna make it or not.

328
00:17:45,881 --> 00:17:48,881
Carry this outta here.

329
00:18:02,674 --> 00:18:03,959
Oh look, look.

330
00:18:03,960 --> 00:18:05,105
Was she raped?

331
00:18:05,106 --> 00:18:06,219
Was it a ritual killing?

332
00:18:06,220 --> 00:18:07,769
I can't
give you any answers now.

333
00:18:07,770 --> 00:18:09,515
- Who's this?
- She's nobody.

334
00:18:09,516 --> 00:18:11,269
Who is the
lady there, the woman?

335
00:18:11,270 --> 00:18:12,703
Leave her alone, please.

336
00:18:12,704 --> 00:18:15,166
Thank you, thank you.

337
00:18:15,167 --> 00:18:16,379
Answer his questions.

338
00:18:16,380 --> 00:18:18,720
Wait, there
was one shot, Lieutenant.

339
00:18:18,721 --> 00:18:20,873
Dr. Samuels, line three.

340
00:18:20,874 --> 00:18:22,009
Comin' through.

341
00:18:22,010 --> 00:18:24,579
Redmond's son just flew in from Ohio,

342
00:18:24,580 --> 00:18:25,930
he's in there with her now.

343
00:18:33,734 --> 00:18:34,734
Oh Joyce.

344
00:18:39,454 --> 00:18:40,454
Mike.

345
00:18:41,818 --> 00:18:42,818
Oh god.

346
00:18:46,885 --> 00:18:50,139
Hey, you come and stay with us, all right?

347
00:18:50,140 --> 00:18:51,140
Okay.

348
00:18:52,790 --> 00:18:54,669
They operated all night.

349
00:18:54,670 --> 00:18:55,770
She's been in and out.

350
00:18:57,110 --> 00:18:59,699
If the bullet had been a fraction
of an inch to either side,

351
00:18:59,700 --> 00:19:01,864
she wouldn't be alive.

352
00:19:12,728 --> 00:19:13,561
Hi.

353
00:19:13,562 --> 00:19:14,783
It's Joyce.

354
00:19:16,566 --> 00:19:18,173
I'm so sorry.

355
00:19:20,662 --> 00:19:21,933
I'm so sorry.

356
00:19:24,190 --> 00:19:25,413
They hurt me.

357
00:19:26,538 --> 00:19:27,538
I know.

358
00:19:28,506 --> 00:19:29,601
I know.

359
00:19:29,602 --> 00:19:30,602
Oh, Pat.

360
00:19:32,034 --> 00:19:33,974
Oh, my god Pat.

361
00:19:33,975 --> 00:19:36,965
- Pat's dead.
- Shh, Marilyn.

362
00:19:36,966 --> 00:19:37,966
Go to sleep.

363
00:19:38,979 --> 00:19:39,979
Go to sleep.

364
00:19:48,956 --> 00:19:50,549
This is one of the
biggest police operations

365
00:19:50,550 --> 00:19:51,609
in our city's history.

366
00:19:51,610 --> 00:19:54,548
The people responsible
will be brought to justice,

367
00:19:54,549 --> 00:19:56,897
I promise you.

368
00:19:56,898 --> 00:19:58,949
It's a bad killing, Joe.

369
00:19:58,950 --> 00:20:00,799
The mayor's on the hot seat.

370
00:20:00,800 --> 00:20:01,650
Well, it won't get any better

371
00:20:01,651 --> 00:20:03,349
with you guys snapping at my heels.

372
00:20:03,350 --> 00:20:04,679
You've got to get those killers.

373
00:20:04,680 --> 00:20:06,579
This is no pool room shooting.

374
00:20:06,580 --> 00:20:09,429
We're talking about two murders
in a home in Scottsdale.

375
00:20:09,430 --> 00:20:11,139
The whole town is running scared.

376
00:20:11,140 --> 00:20:12,469
Four days, Joe,

377
00:20:12,470 --> 00:20:15,239
and your detectives haven't
turn up as much as a footprint.

378
00:20:15,240 --> 00:20:17,819
Now just a minute, I've got
every available man and woman

379
00:20:17,820 --> 00:20:18,653
working on this case.

380
00:20:18,654 --> 00:20:20,859
I wanna get these guys
just as much as you do.

381
00:20:20,860 --> 00:20:21,720
We know that, Joe,

382
00:20:21,721 --> 00:20:24,569
but you've seen the television
coverage, it's killing us.

383
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:25,939
What am I supposed to do?

384
00:20:25,940 --> 00:20:27,333
All I can do is my job.

385
00:20:29,664 --> 00:20:31,069
Dan?

386
00:20:31,070 --> 00:20:32,700
This is my best man.

387
00:20:32,701 --> 00:20:34,419
Come on in, Dan.

388
00:20:34,420 --> 00:20:36,843
You all know Dan Ryan,
my chief investigator.

389
00:20:37,720 --> 00:20:38,770
Anything break yet?

390
00:20:40,140 --> 00:20:41,509
Not in the half hour
I've been sitting out there

391
00:20:41,510 --> 00:20:42,599
waiting for you.

392
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,279
Wise guy, huh?

393
00:20:44,280 --> 00:20:46,739
No sir, I just hate wasting time.

394
00:20:46,740 --> 00:20:48,833
You have something for us, Ryan?

395
00:20:50,140 --> 00:20:52,690
I have Mrs. Redmond's
description of the killers.

396
00:20:58,921 --> 00:21:02,829
Now I'm thinking maybe this
is an armed robbery gone sour?

397
00:21:02,830 --> 00:21:03,989
Thieves don't usually put a bullet

398
00:21:03,990 --> 00:21:06,698
in the back of your head
and then slash your throat.

399
00:21:06,699 --> 00:21:07,949
What if they were high?

400
00:21:09,540 --> 00:21:12,133
There's no evidence of drugs, nope.

401
00:21:13,383 --> 00:21:16,063
What you've got here is a
bonafide contract killing.

402
00:21:16,930 --> 00:21:18,679
With these people?

403
00:21:18,680 --> 00:21:21,279
The Redmonds are the people next door.

404
00:21:21,280 --> 00:21:22,329
So where's the motive?

405
00:21:22,330 --> 00:21:25,369
These clowns are hired guns, understand?

406
00:21:25,370 --> 00:21:28,303
We find them, we find whoever
it is that set up the hit.

407
00:21:29,717 --> 00:21:31,429
Is this all right?

408
00:21:31,430 --> 00:21:33,825
It's the only black dress I have.

409
00:21:33,826 --> 00:21:35,843
You're wearing a gun to the funeral?

410
00:21:37,090 --> 00:21:38,233
I'm scared, Joyce.

411
00:21:39,570 --> 00:21:40,420
Why was Pat killed?

412
00:21:40,421 --> 00:21:42,700
Maybe it had something
to do with the business.

413
00:21:42,701 --> 00:21:43,933
What are you saying?

414
00:21:45,200 --> 00:21:46,883
You think you could be next?

415
00:21:48,780 --> 00:21:50,216
I don't know what to think.

416
00:21:52,310 --> 00:21:53,509
The Redmond murder case

417
00:21:53,510 --> 00:21:55,191
continues to baffle police tonight.

418
00:21:55,192 --> 00:21:57,849
It has been five days
since the brutal killings

419
00:21:57,850 --> 00:22:00,999
of Patrick Redmond and his
mother-in-law, Helen Phelps.

420
00:22:01,000 --> 00:22:02,141
Now this just into the newsroom.

421
00:22:02,142 --> 00:22:05,119
Composite drawings of
the three murder suspects

422
00:22:05,120 --> 00:22:07,689
have just been released
by the police department.

423
00:22:07,690 --> 00:22:09,199
They were assembled by descriptions

424
00:22:09,200 --> 00:22:10,919
provided by Mrs. Redmond,

425
00:22:10,920 --> 00:22:14,329
who miraculously survived
being shot in the head.

426
00:22:14,330 --> 00:22:17,279
Assistant D.A. Joseph
Brownley has asked the public

427
00:22:17,280 --> 00:22:19,478
for their help in the
identification and apprehension

428
00:22:19,479 --> 00:22:21,153
of the Redmond killers.

429
00:22:25,900 --> 00:22:26,900
Martinson.

430
00:22:27,880 --> 00:22:28,880
Who?

431
00:22:29,699 --> 00:22:30,699
Oh yeah?

432
00:22:31,900 --> 00:22:32,992
Take it easy.

433
00:22:32,993 --> 00:22:35,682
They was at my place New
Year's Eve, three of 'em.

434
00:22:35,683 --> 00:22:37,253
They was drinkin'.

435
00:22:38,290 --> 00:22:40,409
I got three, I got three, one of 'em said.

436
00:22:40,410 --> 00:22:41,979
He kept sayin' I got three.

437
00:22:41,980 --> 00:22:43,053
Slow down, okay?

438
00:22:45,631 --> 00:22:48,109
Look, I'm scared, I'm on probation,

439
00:22:48,110 --> 00:22:50,239
I can't afford to mess up.

440
00:22:50,240 --> 00:22:51,180
We'll take care of it.

441
00:22:51,181 --> 00:22:53,219
Do you know where they are?

442
00:22:53,220 --> 00:22:54,220
Yeah.

443
00:22:55,080 --> 00:22:56,733
Chicago.

444
00:23:06,395 --> 00:23:08,274
Get somebody
'round the back of this place.

445
00:23:08,275 --> 00:23:09,243
All right, I got it, I got it.

446
00:23:09,243 --> 00:23:10,194
Get out of the way, move it!

447
00:23:10,194 --> 00:23:11,139
Come with me, Johnson!

448
00:23:11,140 --> 00:23:12,797
Hey, hey, hold
it, police are here.

449
00:23:12,798 --> 00:23:14,057
Move it, move
it, get outta the way!

450
00:23:14,058 --> 00:23:15,116
Police officers coming through.

451
00:23:15,117 --> 00:23:16,860
- Come on, come on.
- Police, open up!

452
00:23:16,861 --> 00:23:17,981
Take it, take it!

453
00:23:20,310 --> 00:23:21,515
- Get in there, get in there.
- Freeze, freeze!

454
00:23:21,516 --> 00:23:22,973
Hold it right there!

455
00:23:22,974 --> 00:23:25,043
- You, up against the wall!
- Don't move! Onto the ground!

456
00:23:25,044 --> 00:23:27,794
- Don't move, don't move!
- Quiet!

457
00:23:28,692 --> 00:23:31,079
- Oh my god!
- Hold it, hold it!

458
00:23:31,080 --> 00:23:33,363
Get her, stop her,
stop right there, come here,

459
00:23:33,364 --> 00:23:34,675
come here, come here, come here.

460
00:23:34,676 --> 00:23:35,986
Hold it, hold it, right
there, right there,

461
00:23:35,987 --> 00:23:37,069
come on baby, come on!

462
00:23:37,070 --> 00:23:37,903
Freeze!

463
00:23:37,903 --> 00:23:38,830
Up before
I blow your brains out!

464
00:23:38,831 --> 00:23:40,205
Relax.

465
00:23:40,206 --> 00:23:41,206
Be calm.

466
00:23:43,020 --> 00:23:44,020
Gotcha.

467
00:23:46,030 --> 00:23:48,977
Mrs. Redmond, you're
certain about those two men?

468
00:23:50,050 --> 00:23:52,339
Yes, I'm certain, they're the ones.

469
00:23:52,340 --> 00:23:54,123
Okay, let the others go.

470
00:23:55,889 --> 00:23:57,736
Thank you, ma'am.

471
00:23:57,737 --> 00:23:58,737
Let's go.

472
00:24:03,650 --> 00:24:05,547
You guys are crazy.

473
00:24:05,548 --> 00:24:07,917
See, I ain't murdered nobody.

474
00:24:07,918 --> 00:24:08,918
Uh-huh.

475
00:24:10,431 --> 00:24:12,199
Well, that's okay Hoop.

476
00:24:12,200 --> 00:24:13,300
We got plenty of time.

477
00:24:14,420 --> 00:24:15,939
I tell you what, why don't we just start

478
00:24:15,940 --> 00:24:18,803
at the very beginning, shall we?

479
00:24:19,867 --> 00:24:21,373
Who hired you?

480
00:24:22,980 --> 00:24:25,069
Hey, come on.

481
00:24:25,070 --> 00:24:26,889
I don't know what the
hell you're talkin' about.

482
00:24:26,890 --> 00:24:28,969
I'm tellin' ya, I never
even heard of Redmond

483
00:24:28,970 --> 00:24:30,863
until I saw his name on television.

484
00:24:31,871 --> 00:24:34,559
Hey, hey, take it easy, Billy.

485
00:24:34,560 --> 00:24:36,226
Didn't do anything,
we're gonna find it out.

486
00:24:36,227 --> 00:24:37,365
I didn't do anything.

487
00:24:37,366 --> 00:24:38,217
Well, if you did do something,

488
00:24:38,218 --> 00:24:39,713
we're gonna find that out, too.

489
00:24:40,570 --> 00:24:41,973
Tell us again.

490
00:24:43,813 --> 00:24:45,899
I gotta have some sleep.

491
00:24:45,900 --> 00:24:47,093
We all have to, Ed.

492
00:24:48,510 --> 00:24:50,813
But not until you tell us
who put out the contract.

493
00:24:56,070 --> 00:24:57,676
Morning.

494
00:25:04,333 --> 00:25:05,449
- Bye.
- Eric, wait a minute.

495
00:25:05,450 --> 00:25:06,283
I gotta run, Mom.

496
00:25:06,284 --> 00:25:07,377
Eric, I wanna talk to you.

497
00:25:07,378 --> 00:25:08,211
Mom, I gotta
rehearse with the band.

498
00:25:08,212 --> 00:25:09,515
Honey, listen to me.

499
00:25:09,516 --> 00:25:11,669
I'm concerned about you and Ron.

500
00:25:11,670 --> 00:25:15,249
I'd appreciate it if you
talked to him once in a while.

501
00:25:15,250 --> 00:25:16,156
Why?

502
00:25:16,157 --> 00:25:19,784
Because he's your
stepfather, and he loves you.

503
00:25:19,785 --> 00:25:22,589
Mom, what Ron loves is Ron.

504
00:25:22,590 --> 00:25:24,469
He's a jerk, and
everybody sees it but you.

505
00:25:24,470 --> 00:25:26,459
Eric, he is my husband,
and I married him

506
00:25:26,460 --> 00:25:27,460
because I love him,

507
00:25:27,461 --> 00:25:28,989
now if you don't wanna make
an effort for yourself,

508
00:25:28,990 --> 00:25:30,440
will you please do it for me?

509
00:25:31,980 --> 00:25:33,049
Sure.

510
00:25:33,050 --> 00:25:34,350
Just like he's doin', huh?

511
00:25:36,900 --> 00:25:37,900
Come on.

512
00:25:40,160 --> 00:25:41,160
Mom.

513
00:25:43,130 --> 00:25:46,238
Give me a hug.

514
00:25:46,239 --> 00:25:47,406
That's my boy.

515
00:25:49,190 --> 00:25:50,440
I'll talk to you later.

516
00:25:58,984 --> 00:26:00,060
Precinct.

517
00:26:00,061 --> 00:26:00,940
Yes, and I said there was a weapon

518
00:26:00,941 --> 00:26:02,196
they need to knew on
Paulson Street this time.

519
00:26:02,197 --> 00:26:03,949
Any luck?

520
00:26:03,950 --> 00:26:05,547
No, still workin' on it.

521
00:26:05,548 --> 00:26:07,192
Another shift in there now.

522
00:26:07,193 --> 00:26:08,193
Gentlemen.

523
00:26:09,260 --> 00:26:10,895
Mr. Hooper just broke.

524
00:26:10,896 --> 00:26:12,563
Gave me two names.

525
00:26:13,470 --> 00:26:16,245
Bobby Cruz and Arnie Merrill.

526
00:26:16,246 --> 00:26:17,079
Hey.

527
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:18,659
Breakfast is on me.

528
00:26:18,660 --> 00:26:19,660
Let's go to work.

529
00:26:21,397 --> 00:26:23,555
I told you.

530
00:26:33,990 --> 00:26:36,073
Thank you, buddy.

531
00:26:39,039 --> 00:26:40,469
Terrific.

532
00:26:40,470 --> 00:26:43,129
We get the warrants late and
the two jokers skip town.

533
00:26:43,130 --> 00:26:44,639
We'll get 'em.

534
00:26:44,640 --> 00:26:46,259
Got any mugshots for me?

535
00:26:46,260 --> 00:26:47,849
Yeah.

536
00:26:47,850 --> 00:26:50,209
Bobby Cruz and Arnie Merrill.

537
00:26:50,210 --> 00:26:51,719
They both have records.

538
00:26:51,720 --> 00:26:54,166
I sent copies to every police
department in the country.

539
00:26:54,167 --> 00:26:55,040
Mm.

540
00:26:55,041 --> 00:26:58,459
So, we catch these two, we
solve the crime of the century?

541
00:26:58,460 --> 00:27:00,179
Yeah, I wish it was that easy.

542
00:27:00,180 --> 00:27:03,409
I got a feeling these two
guys are just the middlemen.

543
00:27:03,410 --> 00:27:04,410
Cruz.

544
00:27:05,190 --> 00:27:06,540
He's Joe Farriola's nephew.

545
00:27:07,730 --> 00:27:09,130
- Chicago family?
- Uh-huh.

546
00:27:10,060 --> 00:27:11,179
He involved in this?

547
00:27:11,180 --> 00:27:12,559
Maybe.

548
00:27:12,560 --> 00:27:14,959
See Cruz thinks he runs Arizona.

549
00:27:14,960 --> 00:27:17,069
He borrowed three boys into town.

550
00:27:17,070 --> 00:27:18,239
What about Arnie Merrill?

551
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:19,529
Arnie's just a cheap wise guy,

552
00:27:19,530 --> 00:27:21,479
runs a small time burglary ring.

553
00:27:21,480 --> 00:27:25,214
He does jobs for Cruz, he picked
our boys up at the airport.

554
00:27:25,215 --> 00:27:27,249
What's the connection to Pat Redmond?

555
00:27:27,250 --> 00:27:29,299
I don't know, but we're
making connections fast,

556
00:27:29,300 --> 00:27:30,539
don't worry.

557
00:27:30,540 --> 00:27:32,659
See Cruz is in real
estate with Arthur Ross,

558
00:27:32,660 --> 00:27:35,429
see Arthur Ross is
Joyce Lukezic's brother.

559
00:27:35,430 --> 00:27:37,209
Business partner's wife?

560
00:27:37,210 --> 00:27:39,159
And guess who Joyce
dated way back in New York

561
00:27:39,160 --> 00:27:40,810
before she met her first husband?

562
00:27:41,661 --> 00:27:42,783
Arnie Merrill.

563
00:27:43,896 --> 00:27:45,650
- Interesting.
- Uh-huh.

564
00:27:46,883 --> 00:27:48,899
But you're not giving me
anything I can take into court.

565
00:27:48,900 --> 00:27:50,959
Joe, you'll be in court
soon enough, all right?

566
00:27:50,960 --> 00:27:54,629
Right now, the name of the game
is to force these guys out,

567
00:27:54,630 --> 00:27:56,569
Arnie and Cruz, make them talk,

568
00:27:56,570 --> 00:27:59,514
then we can grab the bastard who paid 'em.

569
00:28:02,469 --> 00:28:03,447
I don't care what the reason is,

570
00:28:03,448 --> 00:28:04,769
the color bled here.

571
00:28:04,770 --> 00:28:06,801
I won't accept inferior work.

572
00:28:06,802 --> 00:28:08,069
Ron, this is an old machine.

573
00:28:08,070 --> 00:28:10,473
I don't want excuses,
I want it done right!

574
00:28:11,686 --> 00:28:13,386
Do I have to do everything myself?

575
00:28:15,380 --> 00:28:18,772
- Honey, what's the...
- Oh.

576
00:28:18,773 --> 00:28:19,939
What's going on?

577
00:28:19,940 --> 00:28:23,640
Old Ron's been wound
a little tight lately.

578
00:28:35,803 --> 00:28:38,401
Honey, did you have
to chew 'em out like that

579
00:28:38,402 --> 00:28:39,409
in front of everyone?

580
00:28:39,410 --> 00:28:42,399
I'm sick and tired of
their lame excuses, hello.

581
00:28:42,400 --> 00:28:45,020
Yeah, hold on a second.

582
00:28:45,021 --> 00:28:46,870
What are you doing here, anyway?

583
00:28:46,871 --> 00:28:48,069
Well I was hoping

584
00:28:48,070 --> 00:28:50,834
you might be able to come home for dinner.

585
00:28:50,835 --> 00:28:52,828
Can I call you back?

586
00:28:52,829 --> 00:28:54,319
Look.

587
00:28:54,320 --> 00:28:57,379
We haven't spent one night
together since the funeral.

588
00:28:57,380 --> 00:28:58,999
I wish I could, I'm swamped,

589
00:28:59,000 --> 00:29:01,619
the machines are breaking
down, I'm going out of my mind.

590
00:29:01,620 --> 00:29:03,719
We never see you anymore.

591
00:29:03,720 --> 00:29:08,149
Joyce, it's tough without Pat.

592
00:29:08,150 --> 00:29:09,249
Don't you understand that?

593
00:29:09,250 --> 00:29:10,230
Just come home for dinner,

594
00:29:10,231 --> 00:29:12,479
and I'll drive you right
back here afterwards, okay?

595
00:29:13,390 --> 00:29:14,490
I've got work to do.

596
00:29:16,110 --> 00:29:17,167
Hello, right.

597
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:52,839
Excuse me, I'm lookin'
for Harriet McClay.

598
00:29:52,840 --> 00:29:54,539
Are you Merrill's daughter?

599
00:29:54,540 --> 00:29:55,884
Yeah, who's lookin'?

600
00:29:55,885 --> 00:29:59,433
Dan Ryan, with the
county attorney's office.

601
00:30:00,790 --> 00:30:03,409
I'd like to talk to you about your father.

602
00:30:03,410 --> 00:30:04,919
What's he done now?

603
00:30:04,920 --> 00:30:06,229
Well, your father's been connected

604
00:30:06,230 --> 00:30:08,259
to a very serious crime.

605
00:30:08,260 --> 00:30:09,599
I have a warrant for his arrest,

606
00:30:09,600 --> 00:30:11,109
I'd like you to get him a message.

607
00:30:11,110 --> 00:30:12,999
How am I supposed to know where he is?

608
00:30:13,000 --> 00:30:14,000
Just do it, okay?

609
00:30:15,391 --> 00:30:18,169
I have your old man dead
to rights on a murder rap.

610
00:30:18,170 --> 00:30:21,929
Tell him to call me, and
maybe we can make a deal.

611
00:30:21,930 --> 00:30:24,623
Otherwise, he's going to the gas chamber.

612
00:30:30,963 --> 00:30:33,803
Have a good one.

613
00:30:39,035 --> 00:30:40,013
What, what do want right now?

614
00:30:40,014 --> 00:30:41,917
I need something
for the next two months.

615
00:30:41,918 --> 00:30:43,374
I can't talk about
it now, I really can't.

616
00:30:43,375 --> 00:30:46,109
Joyce, we made a
commitment to this business,

617
00:30:46,110 --> 00:30:48,639
do or die, whatever it
takes, what happened to that?

618
00:30:48,640 --> 00:30:50,448
Look, I would love to stay
here and talk to you about it,

619
00:30:50,449 --> 00:30:52,999
but my kids are waiting on
a hot street corner for me,

620
00:30:53,000 --> 00:30:54,203
I have to go!

621
00:30:55,710 --> 00:30:58,209
Well Joyce, I just
wish I had a rich husband

622
00:30:58,210 --> 00:30:59,210
to fall back on.

623
00:31:01,738 --> 00:31:03,668
Hey, what's wrong?

624
00:31:03,669 --> 00:31:06,379
Kathy is upset with me.

625
00:31:06,380 --> 00:31:08,189
I can't say as I blame her though,

626
00:31:08,190 --> 00:31:10,709
I'm not exactly carrying
my share of the load.

627
00:31:10,710 --> 00:31:11,989
Why not?

628
00:31:11,990 --> 00:31:16,279
God, Arthur, these murders
have got everybody crazy.

629
00:31:16,280 --> 00:31:18,599
Ron is flipping out at work,

630
00:31:18,600 --> 00:31:20,422
Eric is not talking to anybody.

631
00:31:20,423 --> 00:31:23,992
I don't seem to be able to keep
my mind on business anymore.

632
00:31:23,993 --> 00:31:25,332
Oh, I know, it's getting to me, too.

633
00:31:25,333 --> 00:31:27,374
I had a visit from the
county investigator.

634
00:31:27,375 --> 00:31:29,957
Lookin' for Bobby Cruz.

635
00:31:29,958 --> 00:31:30,945
Why?

636
00:31:30,946 --> 00:31:33,279
Is Cruz involved?

637
00:31:33,280 --> 00:31:34,280
Do I know?

638
00:31:35,190 --> 00:31:37,266
Took off weeks ago, I
haven't seen him since.

639
00:31:37,267 --> 00:31:41,749
Listen, Joyce, I had a run-in
with Ryan a few months ago,

640
00:31:41,750 --> 00:31:43,409
I mean, this guy is something else.

641
00:31:43,410 --> 00:31:46,289
He drove a truck right through
the window of my gun shop.

642
00:31:46,290 --> 00:31:48,019
Why would he do that?

643
00:31:48,020 --> 00:31:50,549
Oh, he had some idea

644
00:31:50,550 --> 00:31:52,450
that I was running a bookie operation.

645
00:31:53,705 --> 00:31:55,439
Were you?

646
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:58,309
Joyce, the point is,
he's got it in for me,

647
00:31:58,310 --> 00:32:00,379
and I'm just paranoid enough to think

648
00:32:00,380 --> 00:32:02,206
he's gonna try to pin this thing on me.

649
00:32:02,207 --> 00:32:04,089
Oh, come on, that's ridiculous.

650
00:32:04,090 --> 00:32:06,239
No, no it's realistic.

651
00:32:06,240 --> 00:32:07,319
This is a big case,

652
00:32:07,320 --> 00:32:10,018
they're under a lot of
pressure to make a bust.

653
00:32:10,019 --> 00:32:11,719
Now, I'm not gonna take a fall

654
00:32:11,720 --> 00:32:13,677
for something I didn't do.

655
00:32:13,678 --> 00:32:15,039
And Joyce, I'm gonna tell you something,

656
00:32:15,040 --> 00:32:17,733
if I were you, you better look out.

657
00:32:28,630 --> 00:32:30,444
Ryan.

658
00:32:30,445 --> 00:32:32,259
Arnie Merrill here.

659
00:32:32,260 --> 00:32:36,299
Arnie, you're lookin' at
a charge of murder one, pal.

660
00:32:36,300 --> 00:32:37,649
Why don't you do yourself a favor

661
00:32:37,650 --> 00:32:39,050
and come in out of the cold?

662
00:32:41,330 --> 00:32:43,230
Harriet said something about a deal.

663
00:32:44,510 --> 00:32:46,488
I'm not after you, Arnie,

664
00:32:46,489 --> 00:32:48,589
but I want whoever's pulling your strings.

665
00:32:50,427 --> 00:32:51,803
First, we talk.

666
00:32:52,890 --> 00:32:54,367
No cops, alone.

667
00:32:55,876 --> 00:32:58,479
You got my word.

668
00:32:58,480 --> 00:32:59,480
Now where you at?

669
00:33:00,650 --> 00:33:04,183
The city that's so
nice, they named it twice.

670
00:33:17,792 --> 00:33:19,673
Taxi!

671
00:33:39,226 --> 00:33:42,643
Arnie Merrill?

672
00:33:42,644 --> 00:33:44,144
You Arnie Merrill?

673
00:33:48,529 --> 00:33:50,696
You buyin', I'm talkin'.

674
00:33:55,660 --> 00:33:57,260
We both know I'm no trigger man.

675
00:33:58,340 --> 00:33:59,839
No, that's right, Arnie.

676
00:33:59,840 --> 00:34:01,739
You're just a warm and
wonderful human being

677
00:34:01,740 --> 00:34:03,199
who fingered the Redmonds, come on,

678
00:34:03,200 --> 00:34:05,049
I'm tired of this song and dance.

679
00:34:05,050 --> 00:34:06,050
Talk!

680
00:34:06,888 --> 00:34:09,123
I just, I don't know
what's in it for me.

681
00:34:10,040 --> 00:34:11,873
Oh, is that it, eh?

682
00:34:11,874 --> 00:34:13,115
Fine, you don't wanna talk?

683
00:34:13,116 --> 00:34:14,919
I got a warrant right here

684
00:34:14,920 --> 00:34:17,439
that says I extradite you
back to Phoenix tonight.

685
00:34:17,440 --> 00:34:18,440
You ready?

686
00:34:22,864 --> 00:34:25,753
Okay, okay.

687
00:34:27,480 --> 00:34:28,480
Bobby Cruz.

688
00:34:30,472 --> 00:34:33,530
What's the matter with you?
What, you don't hear too good?

689
00:34:33,531 --> 00:34:35,399
We know all about Bobby Cruz,

690
00:34:35,400 --> 00:34:38,083
I need to know who was behind Cruz.

691
00:34:40,030 --> 00:34:41,183
Come on, Arnie, try.

692
00:34:43,224 --> 00:34:44,224
Come on!

693
00:34:45,441 --> 00:34:47,469
Gimme a break, eh?

694
00:34:47,470 --> 00:34:49,219
Hey, this was your break, pal.

695
00:34:49,220 --> 00:34:50,769
Only you're too dumb to know it.

696
00:34:50,770 --> 00:34:51,660
You wanna break?

697
00:34:51,661 --> 00:34:54,242
Come on, let's get outta here,
come on, get up, come on!

698
00:34:54,243 --> 00:34:55,629
All right, hold on.

699
00:34:55,630 --> 00:34:57,329
Hold on, what's the
problem, cool your jets.

700
00:34:57,330 --> 00:34:58,449
- What's the problem?
- Yeah, sit down, eh?

701
00:34:58,450 --> 00:35:00,077
You're under arrest, come on.

702
00:35:00,078 --> 00:35:02,439
All right, all right, all right.

703
00:35:02,440 --> 00:35:04,283
- You gonna talk to me?
- Yeah.

704
00:35:05,140 --> 00:35:06,499
Yeah.

705
00:35:06,500 --> 00:35:07,903
Now, Arnie.

706
00:35:12,994 --> 00:35:14,244
It was Joyce.

707
00:35:15,180 --> 00:35:16,180
Excuse me?

708
00:35:17,287 --> 00:35:18,537
It was Joyce.

709
00:35:19,951 --> 00:35:21,063
Joyce.

710
00:35:21,064 --> 00:35:22,539
Joyce who?

711
00:35:22,540 --> 00:35:24,589
Joyce Lukezic?

712
00:35:24,590 --> 00:35:25,590
You got it.

713
00:35:26,860 --> 00:35:28,402
What, she planned the whole thing, eh?

714
00:35:28,403 --> 00:35:29,405
Right.

715
00:35:29,406 --> 00:35:30,719
Right, what do you take
me for, an idiot, huh?

716
00:35:30,720 --> 00:35:31,799
What do you take me for an idiot, huh?

717
00:35:31,800 --> 00:35:34,719
Get your hands off,
I tell you, it's true.

718
00:35:34,720 --> 00:35:35,771
I can prove it, all right?

719
00:35:35,772 --> 00:35:38,240
- You can prove it?
- I can prove it.

720
00:35:38,241 --> 00:35:39,527
Joyce was the one.

721
00:35:44,120 --> 00:35:45,703
Mom, do we have to wait?

722
00:35:45,704 --> 00:35:46,613
I'm hungry.

723
00:35:46,614 --> 00:35:47,709
Yeah Mom, let's eat.

724
00:35:47,710 --> 00:35:50,379
Ron's not coming, neither is Eric.

725
00:35:50,380 --> 00:35:52,565
Okay.

726
00:35:52,566 --> 00:35:54,119
I'm starving, I'm gonna go.

727
00:35:54,120 --> 00:35:56,600
Take the place mats.

728
00:35:58,042 --> 00:36:00,164
I'm not gonna
call him, you call him.

729
00:36:00,165 --> 00:36:03,192
No, I'm not gonna call the boy.

730
00:36:03,193 --> 00:36:06,035
You wanna
eat, you set the table.

731
00:36:07,290 --> 00:36:08,240
Those things make me nervous,

732
00:36:08,241 --> 00:36:09,939
I told you last night.

733
00:36:09,940 --> 00:36:11,209
We have a deal, remember?

734
00:36:11,210 --> 00:36:13,923
I'm gonna take care of
you, but I need it on tape.

735
00:36:21,230 --> 00:36:22,729
I can't put it on the tape.

736
00:36:22,730 --> 00:36:25,359
I did it on account of fear, sheer fear.

737
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:27,303
I was terrified of Bobby Cruz.

738
00:36:30,345 --> 00:36:32,363
And I didn't get a nickel for it.

739
00:36:38,000 --> 00:36:39,500
Valium, I need it for my back.

740
00:36:41,050 --> 00:36:42,900
Why don't you start talkin', Arnie?

741
00:36:45,720 --> 00:36:48,813
About four years ago, Joyce came to me.

742
00:36:50,052 --> 00:36:53,796
Wanted to know if I knew someone
who would kill her husband.

743
00:36:53,797 --> 00:36:55,083
Her husband?

744
00:36:56,130 --> 00:36:58,132
Why she want him killed?

745
00:36:58,133 --> 00:37:00,399
She wanted to take over the business.

746
00:37:00,400 --> 00:37:02,623
I told her no way, no way.

747
00:37:05,170 --> 00:37:07,529
Okay, what happened next?

748
00:37:07,530 --> 00:37:10,023
Nothin', until last September.

749
00:37:11,510 --> 00:37:13,960
Bobby Cruz showed me this
picture of Pat Redmond.

750
00:37:14,910 --> 00:37:16,310
I asked him where he got it.

751
00:37:17,330 --> 00:37:20,493
And Cruz said, from Joyce.

752
00:37:21,600 --> 00:37:24,133
Cruz offered me $10,000
to take out Mr. Redmond.

753
00:37:25,570 --> 00:37:28,409
Did Cruz say why he
wanted Redmond killed?

754
00:37:28,410 --> 00:37:32,299
Yeah, he said he wanted to
take over the printing company.

755
00:37:32,300 --> 00:37:33,709
He also said within six months,

756
00:37:33,710 --> 00:37:35,230
we get rid of Ron Lukezic.

757
00:37:45,460 --> 00:37:46,910
How does Joyce figure that?

758
00:37:48,639 --> 00:37:50,019
I don't know.

759
00:37:50,020 --> 00:37:51,220
- You don't know?
- No.

760
00:37:54,460 --> 00:37:55,460
Okay.

761
00:37:59,510 --> 00:38:00,510
Maybe.

762
00:38:04,490 --> 00:38:05,490
Maybe.

763
00:38:07,190 --> 00:38:08,663
Were Cruz and Joyce partners?

764
00:38:10,230 --> 00:38:11,748
And maybe they were planning on

765
00:38:11,749 --> 00:38:13,488
running the business together?

766
00:38:13,489 --> 00:38:14,489
It's possible.

767
00:38:16,660 --> 00:38:17,660
Okay, then.

768
00:38:26,970 --> 00:38:30,033
Why did Cruz want Ron Lukezic killed?

769
00:38:32,420 --> 00:38:34,570
Said he wanted to
take over the business.

770
00:38:37,870 --> 00:38:39,595
So he and Joyce could be partners

771
00:38:39,596 --> 00:38:41,263
and run the business together.

772
00:38:48,291 --> 00:38:49,433
Yeah, okay.

773
00:38:50,360 --> 00:38:52,639
Businessman Robert
Cruz was extradited today

774
00:38:52,640 --> 00:38:55,249
from St. Charles, Illinois,
and flown back for trial

775
00:38:55,250 --> 00:38:56,639
here in Phoenix.

776
00:38:56,640 --> 00:38:58,719
Police across the country
have been searching for Cruz

777
00:38:58,720 --> 00:39:00,679
in connection with the
murders of Patrick Redmond

778
00:39:00,680 --> 00:39:02,999
and his mother-in-law on New Year's Eve.

779
00:39:03,000 --> 00:39:03,833
Three other men,

780
00:39:03,834 --> 00:39:06,339
reportedly professional hit
men associated with the mob,

781
00:39:06,340 --> 00:39:08,609
have also been charged with the murders.

782
00:39:08,610 --> 00:39:10,729
Cruz has been working out
of a building in Scottsdale

783
00:39:10,730 --> 00:39:13,129
where he maintained
offices with Arthur Ross,

784
00:39:13,130 --> 00:39:15,069
a local real estate developer.

785
00:39:15,070 --> 00:39:17,569
Police are speculating on
Ross's involvement in the case

786
00:39:17,570 --> 00:39:18,579
but failed to comment

787
00:39:18,580 --> 00:39:21,029
on whether he'd be called
in for questioning.

788
00:39:21,030 --> 00:39:21,863
We will continue to bring.

789
00:39:21,864 --> 00:39:22,909
What's the matter?

790
00:39:22,910 --> 00:39:23,908
Something's wrong.

791
00:39:23,909 --> 00:39:26,780
I'm gonna call your Uncle Arthur.

792
00:39:26,781 --> 00:39:28,147
In other news today,

793
00:39:28,148 --> 00:39:30,054
city officials are making
a controversial proposition

794
00:39:30,055 --> 00:39:34,142
that will limit water use in
residential private homes.

795
00:39:48,580 --> 00:39:50,169
As we turn to our weather map,

796
00:39:50,170 --> 00:39:51,869
it was another scorcher today.

797
00:39:51,870 --> 00:39:54,566
Temperatures of 107 in Phoenix today

798
00:39:54,567 --> 00:39:58,753
while Tucson and Nogales both
reached a sweltering 110.

799
00:39:58,754 --> 00:40:01,087
Come on, let's go.

800
00:40:03,910 --> 00:40:05,186
Yeah, whatever they want.

801
00:40:05,187 --> 00:40:07,720
They wanna go, us doing the report.

802
00:40:07,721 --> 00:40:09,394
And she wouldn't tell?

803
00:40:14,870 --> 00:40:15,752
Wally Roberts?

804
00:40:15,753 --> 00:40:17,266
Dan Ryan.

805
00:40:17,267 --> 00:40:19,179
I appreciate you callin' me.

806
00:40:19,180 --> 00:40:20,289
Hi, how you doin'?

807
00:40:20,290 --> 00:40:21,123
You want a drink?

808
00:40:21,124 --> 00:40:22,403
No, thank you.

809
00:40:26,910 --> 00:40:27,840
This you?

810
00:40:27,841 --> 00:40:29,363
Graphic Designer of the Year?

811
00:40:30,340 --> 00:40:32,979
Campaign of the Year, very impressive.

812
00:40:32,980 --> 00:40:34,909
I manage to keep busy.

813
00:40:34,910 --> 00:40:36,493
Yeah, you must be very good.

814
00:40:38,910 --> 00:40:41,282
Me, I could hardly ever draw.

815
00:40:41,283 --> 00:40:43,319
Well, I guess it's something
you have to be born with,

816
00:40:43,320 --> 00:40:45,639
you know what I mean?

817
00:40:45,640 --> 00:40:47,813
I guess so, this yours?

818
00:40:50,640 --> 00:40:52,723
A pipe is not against the law.

819
00:40:53,596 --> 00:40:55,173
I didn't say it was.

820
00:40:57,930 --> 00:41:02,073
But uh, they use these
to freebase cocaine.

821
00:41:02,074 --> 00:41:03,309
- Yeah.
- Don't they?

822
00:41:03,310 --> 00:41:04,619
I wouldn't know.

823
00:41:04,620 --> 00:41:06,219
The hell you wouldn't.

824
00:41:06,220 --> 00:41:08,587
You're high right now, aren't you?

825
00:41:10,870 --> 00:41:11,870
So Wally.

826
00:41:14,320 --> 00:41:16,563
What is it that you wanted
to talk to me about?

827
00:41:23,040 --> 00:41:24,863
There's a yellow car out there.

828
00:41:26,270 --> 00:41:27,423
I recognize it.

829
00:41:28,510 --> 00:41:32,003
I'm no idiot, and yesterday,
it was a blue car.

830
00:41:33,230 --> 00:41:34,230
So?

831
00:41:35,340 --> 00:41:38,409
Look, I am being followed
here, and I don't like it.

832
00:41:38,410 --> 00:41:39,573
I don't like it at all.

833
00:41:41,020 --> 00:41:42,756
You expect me to do something about it?

834
00:41:42,757 --> 00:41:43,757
Right.

835
00:41:46,140 --> 00:41:49,493
You make them go away,
and I'll make you a deal.

836
00:41:52,350 --> 00:41:53,350
Hm.

837
00:41:55,216 --> 00:41:57,166
Well, what have you got, Wally?

838
00:41:58,296 --> 00:42:01,430
You uh,

839
00:42:01,431 --> 00:42:03,480
you wanna know about the Redmond murders?

840
00:42:08,530 --> 00:42:09,530
Okay.

841
00:42:10,490 --> 00:42:14,603
If the information is good,
I'll see what I can do.

842
00:42:16,200 --> 00:42:17,839
Do it now.

843
00:42:17,840 --> 00:42:19,499
Sure.

844
00:42:19,500 --> 00:42:20,500
Right after I leave.

845
00:42:22,600 --> 00:42:25,663
So Wally, what have you got?

846
00:42:28,390 --> 00:42:29,390
Joyce.

847
00:42:30,490 --> 00:42:32,223
She uh, she told me.

848
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:34,920
Told you what?

849
00:42:38,890 --> 00:42:42,023
Joyce said that she was
gonna have Pat Redmond killed.

850
00:42:44,887 --> 00:42:49,249
Hi, I want another one.

851
00:42:49,250 --> 00:42:50,463
What's the matter, Mom?

852
00:42:51,573 --> 00:42:53,519
Something's wrong.

853
00:42:53,520 --> 00:42:56,175
Your Uncle Arthur is in
some kind of trouble.

854
00:42:56,176 --> 00:42:57,009
Well, I don't thinks so,

855
00:42:57,010 --> 00:42:58,948
I think he just left town
on business or something.

856
00:42:58,949 --> 00:43:00,377
No, without tell me?

857
00:43:00,378 --> 00:43:01,211
No.

858
00:43:01,211 --> 00:43:02,211
It's not like him.

859
00:43:05,473 --> 00:43:06,729
You know what?

860
00:43:06,730 --> 00:43:08,639
I like your hair like that.

861
00:43:08,640 --> 00:43:09,699
Very chic.

862
00:43:09,700 --> 00:43:10,700
Chic?

863
00:43:11,410 --> 00:43:14,879
Ouch, Mom, old ladies are chic.

864
00:43:14,880 --> 00:43:16,469
Excuse me.

865
00:43:16,470 --> 00:43:17,959
Maybe that's why Mark
Campbell doesn't like me.

866
00:43:17,960 --> 00:43:19,399
Maybe he thinks I'm chic.

867
00:43:19,400 --> 00:43:21,185
And who's Mark Campbell?

868
00:43:21,186 --> 00:43:23,109
I told you.

869
00:43:23,110 --> 00:43:24,659
He's that senior that I was gonna call up

870
00:43:24,660 --> 00:43:26,759
and ask to the backwards dance.

871
00:43:26,760 --> 00:43:28,027
So?

872
00:43:28,028 --> 00:43:29,819
I lost my nerve.

873
00:43:29,820 --> 00:43:31,109
No guts, no glory.

874
00:43:31,110 --> 00:43:33,419
No, see, he's got
this amazing girlfriend,

875
00:43:33,420 --> 00:43:34,720
and I'm like from nowhere.

876
00:43:37,497 --> 00:43:40,739
I had a similar problem
when I was in high school.

877
00:43:40,740 --> 00:43:44,499
I'll tell you what Grandma told
me if you think it'll help.

878
00:43:44,500 --> 00:43:45,799
She always used to say,

879
00:43:45,800 --> 00:43:47,992
I think you're a wonderful young woman.

880
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:52,349
And if some bozo doesn't see
the beauty that I see in you,

881
00:43:52,350 --> 00:43:55,074
then he's got a problem, not you.

882
00:43:55,075 --> 00:43:57,769
Does that help?

883
00:43:57,770 --> 00:43:58,770
No.

884
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,680
Never helped me either.

885
00:44:15,178 --> 00:44:16,609
That was great, it was a lot of fun.

886
00:44:16,610 --> 00:44:18,169
We should do that more often.

887
00:44:18,170 --> 00:44:19,949
Well, once we get
that state contract, honey,

888
00:44:19,950 --> 00:44:20,783
I'll have more time.

889
00:44:20,784 --> 00:44:23,303
Ha, I'll never see you then.

890
00:44:24,366 --> 00:44:25,766
Where are my keys?

891
00:44:27,340 --> 00:44:28,619
What the heck?

892
00:44:28,620 --> 00:44:30,829
- Joyce Lukezic?
- Yes.

893
00:44:30,830 --> 00:44:33,125
Phoenix police, I have
a warrant for your arrest.

894
00:44:33,126 --> 00:44:35,940
- What?
- Step out of the car, please.

895
00:44:35,941 --> 00:44:36,941
Over here.

896
00:44:38,301 --> 00:44:39,689
Put your hands on the hood of the car,

897
00:44:39,690 --> 00:44:40,932
spread your legs, we're
gonna frisk you, ma'am.

898
00:44:40,933 --> 00:44:41,842
What?

899
00:44:41,843 --> 00:44:43,529
Mom, stop it, get away from her!

900
00:44:43,530 --> 00:44:45,941
You're charged with conspiracy
to commit capital murder.

901
00:44:45,942 --> 00:44:47,141
What?

902
00:44:47,142 --> 00:44:48,327
You have the right to remain silent.

903
00:44:48,328 --> 00:44:49,376
Eden, go call Ron.

904
00:44:49,377 --> 00:44:51,429
If you up the right to remain silent,

905
00:44:51,430 --> 00:44:53,732
anything you say can and
will be used against you

906
00:44:53,733 --> 00:44:55,233
in a court of law.

907
00:45:09,316 --> 00:45:11,575
- Mom, Mom!
- What are they saying?

908
00:45:11,576 --> 00:45:12,776
What did they say?

909
00:45:12,777 --> 00:45:14,363
They're gonna take my mom away!

910
00:45:14,364 --> 00:45:16,599
- What are they saying?
- Mom, Mom!

911
00:45:16,600 --> 00:45:17,600
Mom, Mom!

912
00:45:19,210 --> 00:45:21,127
- Hold on, there.
- Mom!

913
00:45:22,881 --> 00:45:23,946
Hey!

914
00:45:26,171 --> 00:45:27,171
Mom!

915
00:45:28,537 --> 00:45:29,537
Mom!

916
00:45:37,923 --> 00:45:39,179
Come on now, Joyce.

917
00:45:39,180 --> 00:45:41,148
We all know you had Pat Redmond killed.

918
00:45:41,149 --> 00:45:43,369
Now you'll make it a lot easier all around

919
00:45:43,370 --> 00:45:45,393
if you just tell us thew whole story.

920
00:45:46,660 --> 00:45:48,614
I don't know what you're talking about!

921
00:45:48,615 --> 00:45:50,999
How could you even think I
would do a thing like that?

922
00:45:51,000 --> 00:45:52,973
Those people were my friends!

923
00:45:54,470 --> 00:45:56,819
Why do you keep lying, Joyce?

924
00:45:56,820 --> 00:45:58,609
You're just making it harder on yourself.

925
00:45:58,610 --> 00:46:01,489
I am not lying.

926
00:46:01,490 --> 00:46:02,889
You have the wrong person.

927
00:46:02,890 --> 00:46:05,090
Sooner or later, you're
gonna find that out.

928
00:46:06,244 --> 00:46:07,344
Okay.

929
00:46:09,420 --> 00:46:11,753
Okay, we'll find that out.

930
00:46:13,840 --> 00:46:15,349
Bobby Cruz, you know
Bobby Cruz, don't you?

931
00:46:15,350 --> 00:46:18,759
Wait, wait, please, let
me explain to you who I am.

932
00:46:18,760 --> 00:46:19,760
All right?

933
00:46:20,490 --> 00:46:22,099
I have a home and a family.

934
00:46:22,100 --> 00:46:23,899
My husband is Ron Lukezic.

935
00:46:23,900 --> 00:46:26,229
I have three children,
I run my own business.

936
00:46:26,230 --> 00:46:27,854
How can I think that someone like me

937
00:46:27,855 --> 00:46:30,213
would be involved in a murder?

938
00:46:33,913 --> 00:46:36,899
You were introduced to Bobby
Cruz by your brother Arthur,

939
00:46:36,900 --> 00:46:37,733
is that correct?

940
00:46:37,734 --> 00:46:40,219
We have been through this, I told you!

941
00:46:40,220 --> 00:46:41,353
Tell us again.

942
00:46:42,422 --> 00:46:43,422
All right.

943
00:46:44,849 --> 00:46:48,489
My brother Arthur said that Bobby Cruz

944
00:46:48,490 --> 00:46:51,589
represented some investors from Chicago

945
00:46:51,590 --> 00:46:54,199
who were looking for
real estate in Phoenix.

946
00:46:54,200 --> 00:46:56,569
Did Cruz ever offer
to introduce Ron and Pat

947
00:46:56,570 --> 00:46:58,909
to potential clients for
their printing business?

948
00:46:58,910 --> 00:47:01,509
He talked to Ron a couple of times.

949
00:47:01,510 --> 00:47:04,623
He offered to help him
get some printing orders

950
00:47:04,624 --> 00:47:07,576
from a couple of casinos in Las Vegas.

951
00:47:07,577 --> 00:47:09,903
What kind of printing orders, Joyce?

952
00:47:12,970 --> 00:47:17,970
Ads, brochures, playing
cards, things like that.

953
00:47:18,130 --> 00:47:20,329
It never came to anything.

954
00:47:20,330 --> 00:47:22,779
What would those
printing orders be worth?

955
00:47:24,880 --> 00:47:28,319
To start out with, $25,000, maybe?

956
00:47:28,320 --> 00:47:29,333
Right.

957
00:47:29,334 --> 00:47:31,339
With the prospect of additional orders

958
00:47:31,340 --> 00:47:32,609
from the other casinos

959
00:47:32,610 --> 00:47:35,813
totaling possibly several million
dollars, wouldn't you say?

960
00:47:36,970 --> 00:47:40,239
If they liked their work, I suppose.

961
00:47:40,240 --> 00:47:42,039
So, you could say these Vegas contracts

962
00:47:42,040 --> 00:47:44,509
would make the company a
pretty valuable asset, huh?

963
00:47:44,510 --> 00:47:46,489
What difference does that make?

964
00:47:46,490 --> 00:47:49,109
You do know that your
husband and Pat Redmond

965
00:47:49,110 --> 00:47:53,014
had a buy-back clause
in their partnership?

966
00:47:53,015 --> 00:47:56,049
Yes, but so what?

967
00:47:56,050 --> 00:47:57,050
So what?

968
00:47:57,890 --> 00:47:59,414
So after Pat Redmond's murder,

969
00:47:59,415 --> 00:48:03,063
did your husband buy his
share of the company?

970
00:48:04,130 --> 00:48:05,666
Yes, he did, but...

971
00:48:05,667 --> 00:48:07,382
And in the event of
your husband's death,

972
00:48:07,383 --> 00:48:12,299
you would inherit the whole
company, wouldn't you?

973
00:48:12,300 --> 00:48:13,783
My husband's death?

974
00:48:14,660 --> 00:48:17,233
Yes.

975
00:48:18,240 --> 00:48:19,849
Yeah.

976
00:48:24,668 --> 00:48:28,168
My god, what are you trying to do to me?

977
00:48:31,390 --> 00:48:33,690
Nothing you haven't
done to yourself, Joyce.

978
00:48:36,160 --> 00:48:39,689
You see, you may not
have pulled the trigger,

979
00:48:39,690 --> 00:48:42,313
but you're responsible
for Pat Redmond's murder.

980
00:48:44,389 --> 00:48:46,593
I wanna see you die in a gas chamber.

981
00:48:55,750 --> 00:48:56,583
Are they crazy?

982
00:48:56,584 --> 00:48:58,979
Mom didn't do anything, how
can they just take her away?

983
00:48:58,980 --> 00:48:59,813
Where is she?

984
00:48:59,814 --> 00:49:01,833
- They had her in handcuffs.
- Wait, calm down, all right?

985
00:49:01,834 --> 00:49:02,667
They just
pushed us out of the way!

986
00:49:02,668 --> 00:49:05,403
Calm down, we're
doing everything we can.

987
00:49:06,580 --> 00:49:08,849
Your mother is gonna see Mr. Busey today.

988
00:49:08,850 --> 00:49:09,683
And who's Mr. Busey?

989
00:49:09,684 --> 00:49:11,469
He's a lawyer, the best in Arizona.

990
00:49:11,470 --> 00:49:12,974
He'll clear things up pronto.

991
00:49:12,975 --> 00:49:15,382
Ron, why did they take her away?

992
00:49:15,383 --> 00:49:17,199
It was all a big, dumb mistake.

993
00:49:17,200 --> 00:49:20,395
They'll soon find out she didn't
do anything and let her go.

994
00:49:20,396 --> 00:49:21,589
What if they don't?

995
00:49:21,590 --> 00:49:22,423
They will.

996
00:49:22,424 --> 00:49:23,919
They can't blame this
on her, she's innocent.

997
00:49:23,920 --> 00:49:26,389
Now, I want you all to be real good.

998
00:49:26,390 --> 00:49:29,233
Don't worry, your mom'll be home soon.

999
00:49:32,110 --> 00:49:33,509
Oh.

1000
00:49:33,510 --> 00:49:35,344
Officer, I wonder if you could
give us a little privacy,

1001
00:49:35,345 --> 00:49:36,563
please, sir.

1002
00:49:38,340 --> 00:49:39,383
Mrs. Lukezic.

1003
00:49:40,620 --> 00:49:43,139
I'm Martin Busey, your husband's
retained me to defend you.

1004
00:49:43,140 --> 00:49:45,139
Thank god, how is Ron?

1005
00:49:45,140 --> 00:49:46,409
How are the kids, are they all right?

1006
00:49:46,410 --> 00:49:48,471
Everybody's fine, they
send you their best.

1007
00:49:48,472 --> 00:49:50,632
I'm gonna have you back
with 'em before you know it.

1008
00:49:50,633 --> 00:49:51,857
Do you know what the police are saying?

1009
00:49:51,858 --> 00:49:55,075
They think I had Pat Redmond killed.

1010
00:49:55,076 --> 00:49:55,909
I know.

1011
00:49:55,910 --> 00:49:57,259
I don't know anything
about this whole thing,

1012
00:49:57,260 --> 00:49:58,457
I don't know any killers!

1013
00:49:58,458 --> 00:50:02,589
Um, well, you do know Bobby Cruz.

1014
00:50:02,590 --> 00:50:04,573
See, well, they say he's family.

1015
00:50:05,459 --> 00:50:07,149
Now what about Arnie Merrill,

1016
00:50:07,150 --> 00:50:09,016
did you have an intimate
relationship with him?

1017
00:50:09,017 --> 00:50:11,669
Oh, 20 years ago I
had one date with him once,

1018
00:50:11,670 --> 00:50:13,052
I was 17 years old, for heaven's sake.

1019
00:50:13,053 --> 00:50:14,889
Uh-huh, well see, now I heard

1020
00:50:14,890 --> 00:50:16,919
the relationship was a little
more current than that.

1021
00:50:16,920 --> 00:50:18,449
Come on, that's ridiculous.

1022
00:50:18,450 --> 00:50:20,499
Well now look, I'm on your side, here.

1023
00:50:20,500 --> 00:50:21,909
But you've got to understand something.

1024
00:50:21,910 --> 00:50:22,863
In the next few weeks,

1025
00:50:22,864 --> 00:50:24,802
there's gonna be some very
ugly things said about you.

1026
00:50:24,803 --> 00:50:27,809
Some of it true, some of it not so true.

1027
00:50:27,810 --> 00:50:29,559
But I've got to know what to believe

1028
00:50:29,560 --> 00:50:31,027
in order to fight for you.

1029
00:50:32,584 --> 00:50:36,013
All right, I'm sorry.

1030
00:50:37,373 --> 00:50:38,529
Okay.

1031
00:50:38,530 --> 00:50:39,530
Now.

1032
00:50:41,400 --> 00:50:42,600
Our friend, Mr. Merrill.

1033
00:50:43,570 --> 00:50:46,249
He says that your
brother's organized crime.

1034
00:50:46,250 --> 00:50:48,029
That's a lie.

1035
00:50:48,030 --> 00:50:51,602
My brother Arthur buys
and sells real estate.

1036
00:50:51,603 --> 00:50:54,629
He goes to Las Vegas once
in a while and he gambles,

1037
00:50:54,630 --> 00:50:56,480
but that doesn't make him a criminal.

1038
00:50:59,640 --> 00:51:02,299
Do you also know that the
police have another witness?

1039
00:51:02,300 --> 00:51:05,976
Someone who'll testify
that they heard you say

1040
00:51:05,977 --> 00:51:08,869
you wanted to have Pat Redmond killed?

1041
00:51:08,870 --> 00:51:10,559
Witness, what witness?

1042
00:51:10,560 --> 00:51:13,619
Name is, uh, Wally Roberts.

1043
00:51:13,620 --> 00:51:15,289
Oh, that's totally crazy.

1044
00:51:15,290 --> 00:51:18,449
Why in heavens would Wally
say a thing like that?

1045
00:51:18,450 --> 00:51:21,029
I, uh, I wish I knew.

1046
00:51:21,030 --> 00:51:22,193
Mr. Busey.

1047
00:51:23,050 --> 00:51:27,600
Honest to god, I would
not do a thing like that.

1048
00:51:29,810 --> 00:51:30,810
I'm innocent.

1049
00:51:32,270 --> 00:51:34,759
I believe you, and I'm gonna
do everything in my power

1050
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:36,409
to get you back home where you belong.

1051
00:51:36,410 --> 00:51:38,670
We're working on a bail bond right now.

1052
00:51:41,384 --> 00:51:42,749
Wait, wait, wait,
where are you taking me?

1053
00:51:42,750 --> 00:51:43,740
Club Med.

1054
00:51:43,741 --> 00:51:46,049
No, I'm not supposed to go to jail.

1055
00:51:46,050 --> 00:51:49,007
My lawyer is posting a bond.

1056
00:51:49,890 --> 00:51:52,289
No seriously, I'm not
supposed, this is a mistake.

1057
00:51:52,290 --> 00:51:54,023
You're not supposed to take me here.

1058
00:51:55,343 --> 00:51:57,263
Look, you really don't understand.

1059
00:51:57,264 --> 00:52:00,169
I don't belong in here,
I didn't do anything,

1060
00:52:00,170 --> 00:52:01,170
I'm not a criminal.

1061
00:52:08,279 --> 00:52:09,779
Now wait a minute!

1062
00:52:10,718 --> 00:52:12,985
No, wait a minute, no!

1063
00:52:12,986 --> 00:52:15,331
No, you don't understand,
I don't belong in here,

1064
00:52:15,332 --> 00:52:16,782
I'm innocent!

1065
00:52:16,783 --> 00:52:18,046
Listen to me!

1066
00:52:18,047 --> 00:52:18,880
You know girl,

1067
00:52:18,881 --> 00:52:21,119
I don't think she does belong in here.

1068
00:52:21,120 --> 00:52:22,699
She ain't no criminal.

1069
00:52:22,700 --> 00:52:23,789
No, she's innocent.

1070
00:52:23,790 --> 00:52:26,509
That's right, she's
just here for a visit.

1071
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:28,633
A rich lady on a visit.

1072
00:52:29,524 --> 00:52:31,594
A conjugal visit.

1073
00:52:37,570 --> 00:52:41,406
Honey, I'm gonna treat you so good.

1074
00:52:41,407 --> 00:52:43,490
I'm gonna wish I was you.

1075
00:52:49,474 --> 00:52:50,969
Why can't I come see Mom?

1076
00:52:50,970 --> 00:52:52,689
Aw please, try and understand, Jason.

1077
00:52:52,690 --> 00:52:55,109
They're only allowing two visitors today.

1078
00:52:55,110 --> 00:52:56,253
Even Eric can't come.

1079
00:52:58,960 --> 00:53:00,139
When's she coming home?

1080
00:53:00,140 --> 00:53:01,140
Real soon.

1081
00:53:03,020 --> 00:53:06,149
We're gonna have to
tough this one out, champ.

1082
00:53:06,150 --> 00:53:08,329
Be real grown up about it, huh?

1083
00:53:08,330 --> 00:53:10,093
Yeah, you can come see Mom next time.

1084
00:53:15,319 --> 00:53:16,769
I'll look after him.

1085
00:53:36,586 --> 00:53:38,086
Love you, honey.

1086
00:53:42,930 --> 00:53:45,179
Hi, sweetheart, are you all right?

1087
00:53:45,180 --> 00:53:46,549
I'm okay, Mom.

1088
00:53:46,550 --> 00:53:47,969
And don't worry about Eric and Jason.

1089
00:53:47,970 --> 00:53:50,859
They miss you like crazy, but
they're handling it real well.

1090
00:53:50,860 --> 00:53:53,260
Oh, thank god, I've
been going out of my mind.

1091
00:53:54,870 --> 00:53:56,231
Everything's gonna be all right.

1092
00:53:56,232 --> 00:53:58,578
We're gonna get you out of here.

1093
00:53:58,579 --> 00:54:00,799
When, Ron?

1094
00:54:00,800 --> 00:54:03,813
Busey said I wouldn't have
to spend one day in here.

1095
00:54:05,140 --> 00:54:07,519
It's a capital offense.

1096
00:54:07,520 --> 00:54:10,356
They say it'll take a few more days.

1097
00:54:10,357 --> 00:54:12,739
We've got a great lawyer.

1098
00:54:12,740 --> 00:54:15,219
We've gotta trust Busey, okay?

1099
00:54:15,220 --> 00:54:18,359
We'll get you outta here, I promise.

1100
00:54:18,360 --> 00:54:20,773
Hold on, hold on.

1101
00:55:14,396 --> 00:55:16,243
What do you want?

1102
00:55:16,244 --> 00:55:17,720
Guess.

1103
00:55:17,721 --> 00:55:22,721
Ooh!

1104
00:55:25,064 --> 00:55:26,743
Excuse me.

1105
00:55:26,744 --> 00:55:27,906
Hey!

1106
00:55:27,907 --> 00:55:29,144
- Get her arms.
- What are you doing?

1107
00:55:29,145 --> 00:55:30,466
- Get her arms!
- Turn around!

1108
00:55:30,467 --> 00:55:31,961
What are you doing?

1109
00:55:31,962 --> 00:55:33,329
We're doing.

1110
00:55:33,330 --> 00:55:34,963
You Central Avenue bitch.

1111
00:55:36,260 --> 00:55:39,258
Please god.

1112
00:55:39,259 --> 00:55:44,259
Oh god, no don't.

1113
00:55:45,045 --> 00:55:46,386
Just relax, please.

1114
00:55:46,387 --> 00:55:49,433
Oh god, don't, don't, don't please.

1115
00:55:49,434 --> 00:55:51,270
That's right, squeal!

1116
00:55:51,271 --> 00:55:53,137
I like it when you squeal.

1117
00:55:53,138 --> 00:55:56,408
No, no!

1118
00:55:56,409 --> 00:55:58,802
No, no, please god, no!

1119
00:55:58,803 --> 00:56:00,386
No, no, no, no, no!

1120
00:56:05,480 --> 00:56:07,696
Don't, no, no, no!

1121
00:56:07,697 --> 00:56:08,947
Oh god, no, no!

1122
00:56:12,350 --> 00:56:15,969
Ron, you have to get me outta here.

1123
00:56:15,970 --> 00:56:17,273
Somebody hurt you?

1124
00:56:20,780 --> 00:56:21,780
What happened?

1125
00:56:25,290 --> 00:56:27,072
They put me in this cell.

1126
00:56:29,130 --> 00:56:30,713
Joyce, tell me.

1127
00:56:33,872 --> 00:56:36,463
Women held me down.

1128
00:56:37,670 --> 00:56:39,070
What are you saying?

1129
00:56:42,302 --> 00:56:43,635
They raped me.

1130
00:56:46,359 --> 00:56:47,359
Oh my god.

1131
00:56:50,034 --> 00:56:52,784
Ron, please get me out of here.

1132
00:56:55,842 --> 00:56:58,336
You can't go back in there.

1133
00:56:58,337 --> 00:57:00,267
I'll make them move you.

1134
00:57:04,289 --> 00:57:05,789
Please, help me.

1135
00:57:07,555 --> 00:57:08,723
I will, Joyce.

1136
00:57:11,865 --> 00:57:12,865
I will.

1137
00:57:15,340 --> 00:57:16,340
I promise.

1138
00:57:31,390 --> 00:57:33,035
Eric, did you do the laundry?

1139
00:57:33,036 --> 00:57:34,193
No, I forgot.

1140
00:57:37,013 --> 00:57:38,549
You know, it's not like I'm asking you

1141
00:57:38,550 --> 00:57:39,719
to take the clothes down to the lake

1142
00:57:39,720 --> 00:57:40,779
and beat them with a rod.

1143
00:57:40,780 --> 00:57:42,353
Okay, I'll do it as soon as I can.

1144
00:57:46,122 --> 00:57:47,353
How's Mom?

1145
00:57:50,428 --> 00:57:51,883
Is she okay?

1146
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:54,720
Is she fine?

1147
00:57:55,640 --> 00:57:58,139
She's been in there for three weeks!

1148
00:57:58,140 --> 00:57:59,849
Hey, I'm doing the best I can.

1149
00:57:59,850 --> 00:58:01,929
Yeah, you could've fooled me.

1150
00:58:01,930 --> 00:58:03,904
You got a big mouth, Eric.

1151
00:58:03,905 --> 00:58:05,705
Why don't you shut it up?

1152
00:58:11,381 --> 00:58:13,359
What are you lookin' at?

1153
00:58:13,360 --> 00:58:14,793
When's Mom coming home?

1154
00:58:16,180 --> 00:58:18,209
She'll be home when she's home.

1155
00:58:18,210 --> 00:58:19,789
This place is a pig sty.

1156
00:58:19,790 --> 00:58:20,840
I want it cleaned up.

1157
00:58:28,660 --> 00:58:30,078
Pick that up.

1158
00:58:30,079 --> 00:58:31,079
No!

1159
00:58:35,920 --> 00:58:37,578
I said pick it up.

1160
00:58:37,579 --> 00:58:39,149
Hey, don't you touch him.

1161
00:58:39,150 --> 00:58:40,150
Let him go!

1162
00:58:48,526 --> 00:58:50,795
Is that what you want, Eric?

1163
00:58:50,796 --> 00:58:52,609
Come on, Eric, is that what you want?

1164
00:58:52,610 --> 00:58:53,705
Just stop it, all right?

1165
00:58:53,706 --> 00:58:54,706
Stop it!

1166
00:58:56,205 --> 00:58:57,279
Come on, stop it.

1167
00:58:57,280 --> 00:59:00,129
Come on, okay, Mom's got
enough trouble, just stop it.

1168
00:59:00,130 --> 00:59:02,413
Any time, Ron, any time!

1169
00:59:04,202 --> 00:59:05,202
Lukezic.

1170
00:59:06,870 --> 00:59:08,570
Your bond's been posted, let's go.

1171
00:59:10,090 --> 00:59:11,449
I can go?

1172
00:59:11,450 --> 00:59:12,450
You're outta here.

1173
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:20,937
Come back and visit sometime.

1174
00:59:20,938 --> 00:59:23,354
Wait, bitch!

1175
00:59:23,355 --> 00:59:24,816
No, uh-uh, it's not worth it!

1176
00:59:24,817 --> 00:59:25,650
Oh!

1177
00:59:25,651 --> 00:59:28,983
It's nothing, stop, just stop.

1178
00:59:35,263 --> 00:59:36,666
Mom's home!

1179
00:59:36,667 --> 00:59:37,500
Mom!

1180
00:59:37,501 --> 00:59:39,183
Oh, sweetheart!

1181
00:59:39,184 --> 00:59:41,708
- Mom!
- Oh, I missed you!

1182
00:59:41,709 --> 00:59:44,309
Oh god, I missed you
guys, let me look at you,

1183
00:59:44,310 --> 00:59:45,143
let me look!

1184
00:59:45,144 --> 00:59:46,389
Oh god, you look good.

1185
00:59:46,390 --> 00:59:47,223
You look great, Mom.

1186
00:59:47,224 --> 00:59:49,734
Mom, I hope you don't have
to go back to the slammer.

1187
00:59:51,817 --> 00:59:56,817
Hey, I'm home for good now,
that's it, I'm here, okay?

1188
00:59:59,530 --> 01:00:01,379
Four death sentences came in today

1189
01:00:01,380 --> 01:00:04,069
and the end of the first trial
in the Redmond murder case.

1190
01:00:04,070 --> 01:00:05,929
Robert Cruz, alleged to be a member

1191
01:00:05,930 --> 01:00:08,669
of one of Chicago's most
prominent mob families

1192
01:00:08,670 --> 01:00:09,722
and three professional hit men

1193
01:00:09,723 --> 01:00:12,559
have been found guilty
of conspiracy to murder.

1194
01:00:12,560 --> 01:00:15,959
The four men were sentenced to
die in Arizona's gas chamber.

1195
01:00:15,960 --> 01:00:18,541
Coming up next week is a
hearing for Joyce Lukezic,

1196
01:00:18,542 --> 01:00:20,329
the Scottsdale wife and mother

1197
01:00:20,330 --> 01:00:22,879
who is accused of
masterminding the murders.

1198
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,559
The principle prosecution
witness is Arnold Merrill,

1199
01:00:25,560 --> 01:00:27,099
who claims that Mrs. Lukezic

1200
01:00:27,100 --> 01:00:29,193
entered into a conspiracy with Cruz.

1201
01:00:32,350 --> 01:00:35,204
Just can't figure out
why Arnie would name you.

1202
01:00:36,610 --> 01:00:38,519
I wish I knew.

1203
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:39,520
How about Arthur?

1204
01:00:40,446 --> 01:00:42,039
Why'd he run?

1205
01:00:42,040 --> 01:00:43,169
He was just scared.

1206
01:00:43,170 --> 01:00:44,120
He tried to warn me,

1207
01:00:44,121 --> 01:00:46,543
but Arthur could never
do anything like that.

1208
01:00:48,230 --> 01:00:50,979
At any rate, Busey has filed
a motion for dismissal.

1209
01:00:50,980 --> 01:00:52,630
They'll have to drop the charges.

1210
01:00:53,820 --> 01:00:54,653
They don't have any choice,

1211
01:00:54,654 --> 01:00:56,383
this case doesn't make any sense.

1212
01:00:57,670 --> 01:00:59,527
Oh, god you feel good.

1213
01:01:07,524 --> 01:01:08,357
Uh, come on in.

1214
01:01:08,358 --> 01:01:10,669
Would you all like a cup of
coffee, something cold to drink?

1215
01:01:10,670 --> 01:01:12,899
- No, thanks.
- No, not for me.

1216
01:01:12,900 --> 01:01:16,302
Uh Joyce, Ron, I appreciate
you coming down here.

1217
01:01:16,303 --> 01:01:19,419
Um, I hate to start off on a sour note,

1218
01:01:19,420 --> 01:01:22,063
but we've had a bit of a setback.

1219
01:01:23,040 --> 01:01:23,873
What?

1220
01:01:23,874 --> 01:01:25,653
The dismissal wasn't granted.

1221
01:01:26,893 --> 01:01:28,272
What does that mean?

1222
01:01:28,273 --> 01:01:30,629
It means we're gonna
have to go to a trial.

1223
01:01:30,630 --> 01:01:32,063
I, I'm sorry.

1224
01:01:33,860 --> 01:01:36,285
Martin, you said that couldn't happen.

1225
01:01:36,286 --> 01:01:38,659
Well unfortunately,
the evidence presented

1226
01:01:38,660 --> 01:01:40,659
at the preliminary
hearing was strong enough

1227
01:01:40,660 --> 01:01:41,670
to warrant that.

1228
01:01:41,671 --> 01:01:42,504
What evidence?

1229
01:01:42,505 --> 01:01:44,669
Since when are lies evidence?

1230
01:01:44,670 --> 01:01:46,599
I can't believe this.

1231
01:01:46,600 --> 01:01:49,679
You mean that they seriously think

1232
01:01:49,680 --> 01:01:52,499
that Joyce planned to kill Pat and me

1233
01:01:52,500 --> 01:01:54,604
and take over the company?

1234
01:01:54,605 --> 01:01:57,379
See, the prosecution is going to argue

1235
01:01:57,380 --> 01:01:58,879
that your company was about to be worth

1236
01:01:58,880 --> 01:02:00,789
a great deal of money
because of a printing order

1237
01:02:00,790 --> 01:02:02,239
from Las Vegas.

1238
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:03,649
Now you did go to Vegas last year

1239
01:02:03,650 --> 01:02:05,479
with Bobby Cruz and Ross, right?

1240
01:02:05,480 --> 01:02:08,523
Sure, they took me around,
introduced me to some people.

1241
01:02:08,524 --> 01:02:10,616
Took me to some casinos, hotels.

1242
01:02:10,617 --> 01:02:13,879
I almost pulled off a big
deal, but it didn't happen.

1243
01:02:13,880 --> 01:02:15,480
And Ron could testify to that.

1244
01:02:17,120 --> 01:02:19,389
Well Ron's not gonna testify.

1245
01:02:19,390 --> 01:02:21,029
Why not?

1246
01:02:21,030 --> 01:02:23,849
If I put Ron on the stand,
they can cross-examine,

1247
01:02:23,850 --> 01:02:25,378
and boy they'll have a field day with Ron.

1248
01:02:25,379 --> 01:02:27,983
There's no limit to
what they can insinuate.

1249
01:02:29,680 --> 01:02:31,223
Well he has to testify.

1250
01:02:33,190 --> 01:02:35,089
Martin knows what he's doing, honey.

1251
01:02:35,090 --> 01:02:37,689
Look, we have every
reason to be optimistic.

1252
01:02:37,690 --> 01:02:39,989
Joyce, there's no physical
evidence against you.

1253
01:02:39,990 --> 01:02:42,249
I can convince a jury
that this was a robbery

1254
01:02:42,250 --> 01:02:44,193
that went tragically wrong.

1255
01:02:44,194 --> 01:02:46,989
I don't know.

1256
01:02:46,990 --> 01:02:48,723
Joyce, please.

1257
01:02:49,880 --> 01:02:51,614
Let me do it my way.

1258
01:02:51,615 --> 01:02:55,103
I'll do my best, you have nothing
to worry about, I promise.

1259
01:03:10,998 --> 01:03:12,508
Hello?

1260
01:03:12,509 --> 01:03:15,918
Marilyn, hi, it's me.

1261
01:03:19,700 --> 01:03:20,700
How are you?

1262
01:03:23,377 --> 01:03:24,377
I'm doing okay.

1263
01:03:25,880 --> 01:03:27,460
I hadn't seen you.

1264
01:03:27,461 --> 01:03:31,039
I just wanted to make
sure you were all right.

1265
01:03:31,040 --> 01:03:32,063
I'm just fine.

1266
01:03:36,798 --> 01:03:39,163
It wasn't me, Marilyn.

1267
01:03:42,510 --> 01:03:43,733
You know it wasn't me.

1268
01:04:06,238 --> 01:04:07,599
- Don't say that!
- Shut up!

1269
01:04:07,600 --> 01:04:08,808
You shut up!

1270
01:04:13,655 --> 01:04:15,207
Jason!

1271
01:04:15,208 --> 01:04:16,688
Stop it!

1272
01:04:16,689 --> 01:04:17,689
Jason!

1273
01:04:19,431 --> 01:04:21,082
Jason, stop that!

1274
01:04:21,083 --> 01:04:22,843
Stop it, Billy, get off of him!

1275
01:04:23,680 --> 01:04:25,144
- Stop it!
- Jason, what are you doing?

1276
01:04:25,145 --> 01:04:27,016
Come here, hey, hey,
what's the matter with you?

1277
01:04:27,017 --> 01:04:28,145
Take it back!

1278
01:04:28,146 --> 01:04:29,855
Take it back!

1279
01:04:29,856 --> 01:04:31,185
You take it back!

1280
01:04:31,186 --> 01:04:33,803
I'll grind you to mush, I'll kill you!

1281
01:04:33,804 --> 01:04:35,109
I'll kill you!

1282
01:04:35,110 --> 01:04:36,279
What happened here?

1283
01:04:36,280 --> 01:04:37,369
Who started this?

1284
01:04:37,370 --> 01:04:38,657
He started it.

1285
01:04:38,658 --> 01:04:39,697
Liar!

1286
01:04:39,698 --> 01:04:42,972
You did, you said they
were gonna kill my mom!

1287
01:04:42,973 --> 01:04:45,109
Billy, did you say that?

1288
01:04:45,110 --> 01:04:48,060
Mom, you said they were gonna
put her in the gas chamber.

1289
01:04:51,521 --> 01:04:55,109
I mean, you're kid's turning
into a real troublemaker.

1290
01:04:55,110 --> 01:04:56,110
Come on.

1291
01:05:10,870 --> 01:05:11,703
Hey, sport.

1292
01:05:11,704 --> 01:05:12,790
Leave me alone.

1293
01:05:20,840 --> 01:05:22,309
What's with him?

1294
01:05:22,310 --> 01:05:23,410
He just had a fight.

1295
01:05:25,530 --> 01:05:27,723
Billy told him I was
going to the gas chamber.

1296
01:05:29,320 --> 01:05:30,620
Let him calm down first.

1297
01:05:31,921 --> 01:05:32,921
Oh god.

1298
01:05:33,620 --> 01:05:34,480
He's having trouble now,

1299
01:05:34,481 --> 01:05:36,852
what's gonna happen once the trial starts?

1300
01:05:36,853 --> 01:05:38,793
They're gonna drag me through the mud.

1301
01:05:40,048 --> 01:05:42,199
All you have to do is tell the truth.

1302
01:05:42,200 --> 01:05:43,789
Oh, what's the truth?

1303
01:05:43,790 --> 01:05:46,539
They're gonna sleaze
everything up, you know that.

1304
01:05:46,540 --> 01:05:50,769
Our marriage, our divorces,
our bank accounts,

1305
01:05:50,770 --> 01:05:52,623
our companies, my brother's business.

1306
01:05:53,487 --> 01:05:56,043
I can't let Jason go through that.

1307
01:06:02,800 --> 01:06:03,879
Flight 20 to Boston,

1308
01:06:03,880 --> 01:06:05,080
now boarding gate three.

1309
01:06:07,079 --> 01:06:08,667
I wanna stay with you.

1310
01:06:08,668 --> 01:06:11,186
I want you to stay, honey.

1311
01:06:11,187 --> 01:06:14,686
It hurts me as
much as it hurts you.

1312
01:06:14,687 --> 01:06:17,840
But you're gonna have a
great time with your dad.

1313
01:06:17,841 --> 01:06:20,086
If it hurts, why are
you sending me away?

1314
01:06:20,087 --> 01:06:22,005
Did I do something bad?

1315
01:06:22,006 --> 01:06:24,669
No, no, not at all.

1316
01:06:24,670 --> 01:06:26,803
I love you very, very much.

1317
01:06:27,940 --> 01:06:29,847
I'm always gonna be there for you.

1318
01:06:31,850 --> 01:06:34,531
As soon as this dumb trial is over,

1319
01:06:34,532 --> 01:06:37,129
we're all gonna be
together again like family,

1320
01:06:37,130 --> 01:06:38,620
just like we always were.

1321
01:06:39,667 --> 01:06:41,545
All right? Flight 409 to Chicago

1322
01:06:41,546 --> 01:06:43,629
is arriving at gate nine.

1323
01:06:49,402 --> 01:06:50,902
To carousels four.

1324
01:06:53,930 --> 01:06:55,830
Ready to go, little guy?

1325
01:06:57,878 --> 01:06:59,372
So long, champ.

1326
01:06:59,373 --> 01:07:01,499
Watch out for yourself.

1327
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:02,503
You have fun, okay man?

1328
01:07:02,504 --> 01:07:03,919
I'm gonna miss you little brain.

1329
01:07:03,920 --> 01:07:05,191
Mm, gimme a kiss.

1330
01:07:05,192 --> 01:07:06,192
- Gimme kiss.
- Yuck.

1331
01:07:07,536 --> 01:07:09,879
- Bye, Mom.
- Be good.

1332
01:07:56,298 --> 01:07:58,417
I see 'em, go!

1333
01:07:58,418 --> 01:07:59,918
Come on, let's go.

1334
01:08:04,390 --> 01:08:05,223
Come on, guys.

1335
01:08:05,224 --> 01:08:06,428
Mrs. Lukezic, Mrs. Lukezic.

1336
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:07,681
Are these your children here?

1337
01:08:07,682 --> 01:08:08,690
Are you innocent or guilty?

1338
01:08:08,691 --> 01:08:09,685
Are these your two children?

1339
01:08:09,686 --> 01:08:12,074
How long do you expect the trial to last?

1340
01:08:12,075 --> 01:08:14,979
Excuse me, sir, excuse me, sir.

1341
01:08:14,980 --> 01:08:17,011
We've been
waiting out here for hours.

1342
01:08:17,012 --> 01:08:18,370
We need some help here.

1343
01:08:18,371 --> 01:08:19,347
How long do you expect

1344
01:08:19,348 --> 01:08:20,840
the trial to last, please!

1345
01:08:49,630 --> 01:08:50,680
All rise.

1346
01:08:52,530 --> 01:08:54,809
Department A of the Superior
Court of the State of Arizona

1347
01:08:54,810 --> 01:08:56,169
is now in session.

1348
01:08:56,170 --> 01:08:58,420
The Honorable Rudolph
Gerber Judge presiding.

1349
01:08:59,750 --> 01:09:00,750
Please be seated.

1350
01:09:03,670 --> 01:09:07,140
People of the State of
Arizona versus Joyce Lukezic.

1351
01:09:08,350 --> 01:09:13,350
And um, Pat told me
that Ron was negotiating

1352
01:09:13,390 --> 01:09:15,563
a big order in Las Vegas.

1353
01:09:17,100 --> 01:09:19,279
Joyce's brother was gonna
get them all the printing

1354
01:09:19,280 --> 01:09:22,675
they wanted, worth millions of dollars.

1355
01:09:22,676 --> 01:09:25,209
And what happened
to that Las Vegas business?

1356
01:09:25,210 --> 01:09:26,873
Well, it fell through.

1357
01:09:28,852 --> 01:09:31,743
Pat said, I don't want to
have anything to do with it.

1358
01:09:34,620 --> 01:09:39,620
He was not willing to kick
back or pay bribes to the mob.

1359
01:09:41,790 --> 01:09:45,019
I said to Joyce, I hear
the Vegas deal is off.

1360
01:09:45,020 --> 01:09:46,409
She was mad.

1361
01:09:46,410 --> 01:09:48,569
She said, the deal is not off.

1362
01:09:48,570 --> 01:09:49,919
What else did she say?

1363
01:09:49,920 --> 01:09:52,820
She said she was tired of
Pat holding the business back.

1364
01:09:54,480 --> 01:09:58,833
She said, I'm going to have
the son of a bitch wasted.

1365
01:10:00,380 --> 01:10:03,753
She said, I have the connections
to have Pat Redmond killed.

1366
01:10:07,190 --> 01:10:09,539
I will bar from this court anyone,

1367
01:10:09,540 --> 01:10:11,549
including any member of the media,

1368
01:10:11,550 --> 01:10:14,879
that disrupts these proceedings.

1369
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:15,880
Your witness.

1370
01:10:17,719 --> 01:10:21,869
Mr. Roberts, you have a
severe drinking problem,

1371
01:10:21,870 --> 01:10:22,703
don't you?

1372
01:10:22,703 --> 01:10:23,536
Objection, Your Honor.

1373
01:10:23,537 --> 01:10:24,689
Irrelevant and immaterial.

1374
01:10:24,690 --> 01:10:26,609
It relates to the witness's credibility

1375
01:10:26,610 --> 01:10:28,383
and objectivity, Your Honor.

1376
01:10:29,400 --> 01:10:30,613
Overruled.

1377
01:10:32,620 --> 01:10:36,679
Yes, I'm a recovering alcoholic in AA.

1378
01:10:36,680 --> 01:10:37,680
Uh-huh.

1379
01:10:39,020 --> 01:10:42,213
Now, Mr. Roberts.

1380
01:10:43,520 --> 01:10:46,789
Did you also have a problem
last year with narcotics

1381
01:10:46,790 --> 01:10:48,929
or drugs of any nature?

1382
01:10:48,930 --> 01:10:50,473
Yes, I did.

1383
01:10:52,370 --> 01:10:56,009
In fact, Mr. Roberts,
isn't it fair to say

1384
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:58,898
that every single day, you
were either high on alcohol

1385
01:10:58,899 --> 01:11:01,679
or high on cocaine at
some part of the day?

1386
01:11:01,680 --> 01:11:02,793
Yes, I was.

1387
01:11:04,340 --> 01:11:08,942
I was high most of the day
on one thing or another.

1388
01:11:13,990 --> 01:11:15,823
No further
questions, Your Honor.

1389
01:11:21,143 --> 01:11:22,463
Don't worry.

1390
01:11:25,821 --> 01:11:27,919
Wally looked like a jerk.

1391
01:11:27,920 --> 01:11:29,745
The jury's gonna discount his testimony.

1392
01:11:29,746 --> 01:11:30,793
Maybe not.

1393
01:11:31,720 --> 01:11:33,569
See, maybe they're thinkin'
we wouldn't be so dumb

1394
01:11:33,570 --> 01:11:35,212
as to use that clown as a witness

1395
01:11:35,213 --> 01:11:37,089
unless he was tellin' the truth.

1396
01:11:37,090 --> 01:11:38,066
Oh yeah?

1397
01:11:38,067 --> 01:11:40,159
We'll get hurt.

1398
01:11:40,160 --> 01:11:42,109
I need to re-establish credibility fast.

1399
01:11:42,110 --> 01:11:43,205
Well, I'm workin' on it.

1400
01:11:43,206 --> 01:11:45,789
Don't work on it, fix it.

1401
01:11:45,790 --> 01:11:48,103
My job is on the line, so is yours.

1402
01:11:54,910 --> 01:11:56,907
Be careful with that.

1403
01:11:56,908 --> 01:11:58,133
Set it down here.

1404
01:12:11,813 --> 01:12:13,377
Having a little garage sale?

1405
01:12:13,378 --> 01:12:16,173
More like a
going-out-of-business, sale.

1406
01:12:17,170 --> 01:12:19,063
Mm, I was gonna get one of these.

1407
01:12:20,677 --> 01:12:23,169
But I figured, why spend all the money.

1408
01:12:23,170 --> 01:12:25,482
I could just go out and run five miles.

1409
01:12:25,483 --> 01:12:27,233
Of course, I didn't do that either.

1410
01:12:28,760 --> 01:12:29,989
Can I do
something for you, Mr. Ryan?

1411
01:12:29,990 --> 01:12:31,249
Yes, you can.

1412
01:12:31,250 --> 01:12:33,499
You could answer a few more
questions about your partner.

1413
01:12:33,500 --> 01:12:35,219
If you don't mind.

1414
01:12:35,220 --> 01:12:36,220
My ex-partner.

1415
01:12:36,940 --> 01:12:38,663
And I've already told you all I know.

1416
01:12:40,910 --> 01:12:41,910
Oh yeah?

1417
01:12:43,170 --> 01:12:44,130
Well, seems to me

1418
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:46,273
you had a pretty good
little business here.

1419
01:12:47,430 --> 01:12:48,969
Why'd you walk away from it?

1420
01:12:48,970 --> 01:12:50,712
Well, I'm not the one doing the walking,

1421
01:12:50,713 --> 01:12:53,379
so I can't really answer that, can I?

1422
01:12:53,380 --> 01:12:55,239
So Joyce quit?

1423
01:12:55,240 --> 01:12:56,729
Yep.

1424
01:12:56,730 --> 01:12:59,937
After I left a good job to go into this.

1425
01:12:59,938 --> 01:13:00,938
You know.

1426
01:13:02,376 --> 01:13:04,883
She's gotta spend some
time now with her family.

1427
01:13:05,831 --> 01:13:07,510
Her husband.

1428
01:13:07,511 --> 01:13:10,990
They're pretty close, aren't they?

1429
01:13:10,991 --> 01:13:12,765
Her husband?

1430
01:13:12,766 --> 01:13:14,990
You really don't know anything, do you?

1431
01:13:16,994 --> 01:13:18,989
They got a few problems?

1432
01:13:18,990 --> 01:13:20,073
A few?

1433
01:13:24,350 --> 01:13:26,479
Have you talked to anyone else?

1434
01:13:26,480 --> 01:13:28,180
I mean, it's not exactly a secret.

1435
01:13:38,201 --> 01:13:39,759
Are you saying what
I think you're saying?

1436
01:13:39,760 --> 01:13:41,259
I'm saying that Joyce was upset

1437
01:13:41,260 --> 01:13:43,913
because her husband was having
affairs with other women.

1438
01:13:45,796 --> 01:13:47,189
Objection, Your Honor.

1439
01:13:47,190 --> 01:13:49,839
Move to strike, this is not relevant.

1440
01:13:49,840 --> 01:13:51,923
Objection is provisionally overruled.

1441
01:13:52,830 --> 01:13:54,159
Go ahead.

1442
01:13:54,160 --> 01:13:55,410
What did she say?

1443
01:13:57,733 --> 01:14:00,789
She said that she would
have Ron taken care of.

1444
01:14:00,790 --> 01:14:02,888
She said her brother had
connections in the mob,

1445
01:14:02,889 --> 01:14:06,423
she said she'd have Ron's
ass and his business, too.

1446
01:14:10,120 --> 01:14:12,473
Order, order in the court.

1447
01:14:12,474 --> 01:14:13,593
Order in the court.

1448
01:14:21,830 --> 01:14:22,720
Why didn't you tell me?

1449
01:14:22,721 --> 01:14:24,499
- It was nothing.
- Nothing?

1450
01:14:24,500 --> 01:14:25,743
You knew we were vulnerable.

1451
01:14:25,744 --> 01:14:27,799
Why did you conceal that affair from me?

1452
01:14:27,800 --> 01:14:30,039
It happened last year.

1453
01:14:30,040 --> 01:14:32,213
It was an affair, it meant nothing.

1454
01:14:33,470 --> 01:14:35,929
I was devastated when I found out.

1455
01:14:35,930 --> 01:14:38,825
All I wanted to do was to hit back at Ron.

1456
01:14:38,826 --> 01:14:40,039
Now wait a minute here,

1457
01:14:40,040 --> 01:14:41,509
did you actually say those things

1458
01:14:41,510 --> 01:14:43,419
about having Ron taken care of?

1459
01:14:43,420 --> 01:14:47,151
It didn't mean anything,
it was just crazy talk.

1460
01:14:47,152 --> 01:14:48,819
We talked it over

1461
01:14:48,820 --> 01:14:52,853
and decided to give our
marriage another chance.

1462
01:14:58,370 --> 01:15:00,083
Is there anything else I need to know?

1463
01:15:03,007 --> 01:15:04,007
No.

1464
01:15:05,054 --> 01:15:07,263
How badly did Kathy hurt us?

1465
01:15:10,070 --> 01:15:13,554
She just shoved a knife in our back.

1466
01:15:18,330 --> 01:15:19,163
Hello?

1467
01:15:19,164 --> 01:15:21,606
Murderer,
you're gonna burn in hell.

1468
01:15:21,607 --> 01:15:23,894
You have a nice day too.

1469
01:15:28,160 --> 01:15:29,267
I'll have the number changed.

1470
01:15:29,268 --> 01:15:30,101
No, you won't.

1471
01:15:30,101 --> 01:15:31,101
Days of this.

1472
01:15:32,094 --> 01:15:33,994
I just want it all to be over.

1473
01:15:36,010 --> 01:15:37,319
Joyce, would you be very upset

1474
01:15:37,320 --> 01:15:39,070
if I didn't come to court tomorrow?

1475
01:15:40,990 --> 01:15:43,053
Ron, I need you there.

1476
01:15:44,417 --> 01:15:45,250
And I wanna be with you,

1477
01:15:45,251 --> 01:15:47,210
but I've been thinking about the TV news.

1478
01:15:48,190 --> 01:15:50,073
They'll be on us like flies tomorrow.

1479
01:15:52,030 --> 01:15:53,989
There's not much we can
do about that, now is there.

1480
01:15:53,990 --> 01:15:55,290
Yeah, we could avoid it.

1481
01:15:56,130 --> 01:15:57,278
I just don't wanna create a situation

1482
01:15:57,279 --> 01:15:59,919
where our marriage is
on trial in the TV news.

1483
01:15:59,920 --> 01:16:01,939
The trial belongs in the courtroom.

1484
01:16:01,940 --> 01:16:02,940
Honey.

1485
01:16:04,510 --> 01:16:06,739
I really need you to be there for me.

1486
01:16:06,740 --> 01:16:09,539
I mean, it's bad enough that
my own brother took off.

1487
01:16:09,540 --> 01:16:11,019
How do you think I feel?

1488
01:16:11,020 --> 01:16:15,239
Look Joyce, I am doing
everything I can for you.

1489
01:16:15,240 --> 01:16:16,180
Everything.

1490
01:16:16,181 --> 01:16:17,399
The lawyers are expensive,

1491
01:16:17,400 --> 01:16:19,549
the business is damn near bankrupt.

1492
01:16:19,550 --> 01:16:22,263
We don't agree on this,
but I know I'm right.

1493
01:16:28,445 --> 01:16:31,899
Joyce, honey.

1494
01:16:31,900 --> 01:16:32,900
Joyce.

1495
01:16:39,230 --> 01:16:41,759
Last Thanksgiving, I was
sitting in the waiting room

1496
01:16:41,760 --> 01:16:45,309
of Sunview Development, and Joyce came in.

1497
01:16:45,310 --> 01:16:48,009
She went into her brother's office, right,

1498
01:16:48,010 --> 01:16:49,959
and Mr. Cruz was there at the time.

1499
01:16:49,960 --> 01:16:51,979
Did you attempt
to listen at the door?

1500
01:16:51,980 --> 01:16:53,969
I didn't have to listen at no door.

1501
01:16:53,970 --> 01:16:56,199
The sound came right through the wall.

1502
01:16:56,200 --> 01:16:58,509
What were they talking about?

1503
01:16:58,510 --> 01:16:59,674
Well, Joyce asked Mr. Cruz

1504
01:16:59,675 --> 01:17:03,369
why Mr. Redmond hadn't
been taken care of yet.

1505
01:17:03,370 --> 01:17:05,482
Did Mr. Cruz reply?

1506
01:17:05,483 --> 01:17:06,523
Yes, he did.

1507
01:17:07,370 --> 01:17:09,569
He told Joyce that Mr.
Redmond would be dead

1508
01:17:09,570 --> 01:17:14,009
before Christmas.

1509
01:17:14,010 --> 01:17:15,060
Your witness.

1510
01:17:20,200 --> 01:17:23,695
Mr. Merrill, do you
tell lies very often?

1511
01:17:23,696 --> 01:17:27,119
Objection, Your Honor,
he's insulting the witness.

1512
01:17:27,120 --> 01:17:28,120
Sustained.

1513
01:17:32,216 --> 01:17:33,049
Isn't it true, Mr. Merrill,

1514
01:17:33,050 --> 01:17:34,379
that you knew you were about to be charged

1515
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,320
with first degree murder

1516
01:17:35,321 --> 01:17:37,209
unless you could come up with a story

1517
01:17:37,210 --> 01:17:40,619
that could cut yourself a
deal with the prosecution?

1518
01:17:40,620 --> 01:17:41,453
No, sir.

1519
01:17:41,454 --> 01:17:43,090
And in order to save your own skin,

1520
01:17:43,091 --> 01:17:45,129
you tried to convince them

1521
01:17:45,130 --> 01:17:47,359
that Joyce Lukezic was
involved, didn't you?

1522
01:17:47,360 --> 01:17:48,410
No.

1523
01:17:48,411 --> 01:17:49,799
Isn't that why you
concocted this whole story?

1524
01:17:49,800 --> 01:17:50,633
- Objection.
- No.

1525
01:17:50,633 --> 01:17:51,466
He asked and answered,

1526
01:17:51,467 --> 01:17:52,470
he's putting up a smokescreen.

1527
01:17:52,471 --> 01:17:56,361
No, nope, nope, I
didn't make up no story.

1528
01:17:56,362 --> 01:17:58,149
I'm tellin' the truth.

1529
01:17:58,150 --> 01:18:01,007
You just don't wanna hear the truth, eh?

1530
01:18:02,420 --> 01:18:04,690
Joyce was behind the whole thing.

1531
01:18:04,691 --> 01:18:07,458
I was there, I heard her.

1532
01:18:10,672 --> 01:18:11,749
Order.

1533
01:18:11,750 --> 01:18:12,777
Order in the court.

1534
01:18:12,778 --> 01:18:14,870
They walked right into that one.

1535
01:18:14,871 --> 01:18:16,418
Oh yeah.

1536
01:18:40,890 --> 01:18:42,490
Do you have to read that here?

1537
01:18:44,020 --> 01:18:46,129
Okay, we'll throw
all the newspapers out,

1538
01:18:46,130 --> 01:18:48,869
we'll unplug the TV, we
won't think about it,

1539
01:18:48,870 --> 01:18:50,739
we won't talk about it at all.

1540
01:18:50,740 --> 01:18:53,439
I just don't wanna
see Arnie Merrill's face

1541
01:18:53,440 --> 01:18:54,273
in my own house.

1542
01:18:54,274 --> 01:18:55,970
Honey, you're acting like a kid.

1543
01:18:57,554 --> 01:18:59,769
Mm, smells good.

1544
01:18:59,770 --> 01:19:02,770
Hope she serves it
sometime before Thanksgiving.

1545
01:19:02,771 --> 01:19:05,019
Isn't it a beautiful day?

1546
01:19:05,020 --> 01:19:06,962
What are you, the weather girl?

1547
01:19:06,963 --> 01:19:08,659
I gotta run.

1548
01:19:08,660 --> 01:19:10,453
Are you gonna be in court today?

1549
01:19:12,670 --> 01:19:14,183
I'll try and make it.

1550
01:19:14,184 --> 01:19:16,373
You'll try and make it.

1551
01:19:18,655 --> 01:19:19,488
I got a problem at the plant.

1552
01:19:19,489 --> 01:19:21,853
I don't give a damn
about the plant, Ron.

1553
01:19:21,854 --> 01:19:24,069
I need you there.

1554
01:19:24,070 --> 01:19:26,899
Busey is putting me on the stand today.

1555
01:19:26,900 --> 01:19:28,189
Honey, please.

1556
01:19:28,190 --> 01:19:29,299
Please what?

1557
01:19:29,300 --> 01:19:30,889
Just go ahead and tell
everybody I'm guilty,

1558
01:19:30,890 --> 01:19:31,940
and get it over with?

1559
01:19:33,730 --> 01:19:36,430
We just don't seem to be
able to communicate, do we?

1560
01:19:37,710 --> 01:19:39,689
I'm doing all I can to help you.

1561
01:19:39,690 --> 01:19:41,209
I'm paying for your lawyer.

1562
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,610
How am I supposed to do
that if I don't work?

1563
01:19:43,611 --> 01:19:45,983
Well, just go ahead
and get outta here then!

1564
01:19:55,330 --> 01:19:56,576
Mrs. Lukezic,

1565
01:19:56,577 --> 01:19:58,753
could you speak a little louder, please?

1566
01:20:00,560 --> 01:20:05,159
I said, I didn't hire any killers.

1567
01:20:05,160 --> 01:20:07,103
I wouldn't know how to.

1568
01:20:09,360 --> 01:20:14,360
This whole thing has been some
kind of incredible mistake.

1569
01:20:16,187 --> 01:20:17,187
Thank you.

1570
01:20:18,850 --> 01:20:20,500
No further questions, Your Honor.

1571
01:20:27,710 --> 01:20:31,089
Did Bobby Cruz ever tell you
that he knew three hit men?

1572
01:20:31,090 --> 01:20:34,829
No, he never told me
anything about any hit men.

1573
01:20:34,830 --> 01:20:36,939
I don't know any hit men.

1574
01:20:36,940 --> 01:20:39,123
I don't even know Mr. Cruz that well.

1575
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:42,479
Are you telling this jury
that your ex-boyfriend,

1576
01:20:42,480 --> 01:20:44,130
Arnie Merrill, was incorrect

1577
01:20:44,131 --> 01:20:46,109
when he said you went
to your brother's office

1578
01:20:46,110 --> 01:20:48,249
and asked Cruz why Redmond
hadn't been taken care of?

1579
01:20:48,250 --> 01:20:49,493
Yes, I am.

1580
01:20:52,080 --> 01:20:56,333
But uh, you wanted that Las
Vegas business, didn't you?

1581
01:20:57,620 --> 01:21:01,835
I wanted it as much
as my husband did, yes.

1582
01:21:01,836 --> 01:21:02,949
Mm-hm.

1583
01:21:02,950 --> 01:21:05,579
And Mr. Cruz wanted that
business a lot too, didn't he?

1584
01:21:05,580 --> 01:21:07,959
I don't know what Mr. Cruz wanted.

1585
01:21:07,960 --> 01:21:11,417
And your brother wanted it
as well, isn't that right?

1586
01:21:11,418 --> 01:21:14,209
No, that's not true.

1587
01:21:14,210 --> 01:21:15,070
Isn't it?

1588
01:21:15,071 --> 01:21:17,019
Weren't you and your
brother and Bobby Cruz

1589
01:21:17,020 --> 01:21:18,509
all planning on murdering
your husband next

1590
01:21:18,510 --> 01:21:20,559
so you could all get your
greedy hands on that business?

1591
01:21:20,560 --> 01:21:21,581
Objection, Your Honor.

1592
01:21:21,582 --> 01:21:23,292
He's badgering the witness.

1593
01:21:23,293 --> 01:21:24,713
Sustained.

1594
01:21:28,110 --> 01:21:30,409
What was your share of
the spoils going to be?

1595
01:21:30,410 --> 01:21:31,519
Nothing.

1596
01:21:31,520 --> 01:21:32,520
Nothing.

1597
01:21:34,045 --> 01:21:35,045
Well.

1598
01:21:36,200 --> 01:21:38,785
That's exactly what Pat Redmond got.

1599
01:21:38,786 --> 01:21:41,719
Isn't it?

1600
01:21:41,720 --> 01:21:42,787
Mr. Brownley.

1601
01:21:43,850 --> 01:21:46,736
Pat Redmond was a friend of mine.

1602
01:21:46,737 --> 01:21:50,463
We're talking about the
murder of my close friend.

1603
01:21:51,360 --> 01:21:52,433
I couldn't do that.

1604
01:21:53,640 --> 01:21:56,923
Don't you understand, I
couldn't do that!

1605
01:22:10,520 --> 01:22:12,959
The defendant said,
I have the connections

1606
01:22:12,960 --> 01:22:14,423
to have Pat Redmond killed.

1607
01:22:15,910 --> 01:22:17,913
This is not a robbery or a burglary.

1608
01:22:19,100 --> 01:22:20,100
Not at all.

1609
01:22:20,910 --> 01:22:24,169
This is a calculated contract murder.

1610
01:22:24,170 --> 01:22:26,399
Joyce Lukezic intended
to kill her own husband

1611
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:27,400
six months later.

1612
01:22:28,410 --> 01:22:29,663
And her motive was money.

1613
01:22:30,810 --> 01:22:32,129
She wanted that printing company

1614
01:22:32,130 --> 01:22:33,730
so that she could make millions.

1615
01:22:35,556 --> 01:22:39,123
This is a ruthless, greedy woman,

1616
01:22:39,990 --> 01:22:41,990
who bought the death of her best friend.

1617
01:22:55,460 --> 01:22:56,460
Joyce?

1618
01:22:57,560 --> 01:22:59,104
Joyce, you okay?

1619
01:22:59,105 --> 01:23:00,105
- Hm?
- Mm-hm.

1620
01:23:01,740 --> 01:23:03,019
- I do.
- Here she is.

1621
01:23:03,020 --> 01:23:05,417
It worked, everything's gonna be fine.

1622
01:23:05,418 --> 01:23:07,441
How long do you
think the jury'll be out?

1623
01:23:07,442 --> 01:23:08,813
What do you think your
chances are, Mrs. Lukezic?

1624
01:23:08,814 --> 01:23:10,826
Are you okay?

1625
01:23:10,827 --> 01:23:12,677
The lady needs some help here, Joyce.

1626
01:23:14,300 --> 01:23:15,834
Get that stuff outta here!

1627
01:23:15,835 --> 01:23:17,475
Hey, call a doctor!

1628
01:23:17,476 --> 01:23:18,643
Call a doctor!

1629
01:23:19,568 --> 01:23:21,430
Dr. James to hematology.

1630
01:23:21,431 --> 01:23:23,956
- Joyce.
- Dr. James to hematology.

1631
01:23:23,957 --> 01:23:27,374
Joyce.

1632
01:23:34,046 --> 01:23:35,379
What happened?

1633
01:23:37,343 --> 01:23:38,993
They think it's a heart attack.

1634
01:23:40,482 --> 01:23:41,370
A mild one.

1635
01:23:41,370 --> 01:23:42,370
Oh, great.

1636
01:23:44,108 --> 01:23:47,709
The state wants to kill me,
my heart wants to kill me,

1637
01:23:47,710 --> 01:23:49,093
everybody wants to kill me.

1638
01:23:53,799 --> 01:23:54,893
Joyce.

1639
01:23:56,600 --> 01:23:58,573
I love you so.

1640
01:24:02,474 --> 01:24:04,974
And you're gonna be just fine.

1641
01:24:05,900 --> 01:24:07,483
Where are Eric and Eden?

1642
01:24:08,510 --> 01:24:09,510
Right here.

1643
01:24:10,420 --> 01:24:11,420
In the waiting room.

1644
01:24:13,460 --> 01:24:14,623
I feel so sorry, baby.

1645
01:24:17,640 --> 01:24:18,983
I feel it's my fault.

1646
01:24:20,610 --> 01:24:21,910
I should've been with you.

1647
01:24:23,677 --> 01:24:26,760
I did all right, it doesn't matter.

1648
01:24:29,150 --> 01:24:31,950
I'm so sick and tired of
this thing coming between us.

1649
01:24:34,430 --> 01:24:35,430
Be patient with me.

1650
01:24:37,437 --> 01:24:38,487
Someday I'll grow up.

1651
01:24:43,485 --> 01:24:45,534
Just hold me.

1652
01:24:50,979 --> 01:24:52,693
Baby.

1653
01:24:52,694 --> 01:24:54,763
I'm so sorry.

1654
01:24:56,250 --> 01:24:59,063
I understand the jury
has reached a verdict.

1655
01:24:59,990 --> 01:25:02,619
Due to the sudden
illness of the defendant,

1656
01:25:02,620 --> 01:25:05,583
we will waive her presence
for the taking of the verdict.

1657
01:25:07,400 --> 01:25:08,700
Bailiff, show the jury in.

1658
01:25:32,190 --> 01:25:34,129
Mr. Foreman, would you
please hand your verdict

1659
01:25:34,130 --> 01:25:35,130
to the bailiff?

1660
01:25:58,630 --> 01:26:00,846
What honey, what is it?

1661
01:26:00,847 --> 01:26:01,989
What?

1662
01:26:01,990 --> 01:26:03,715
Oh god Mom, they found you guilty!

1663
01:26:03,716 --> 01:26:04,716
No, no!

1664
01:26:05,668 --> 01:26:07,168
No, don't do this!

1665
01:26:08,241 --> 01:26:10,260
I didn't do anything!

1666
01:26:10,261 --> 01:26:14,911
Jesus, I didn't do anything!

1667
01:26:14,912 --> 01:26:18,199
Oh, Mommy!

1668
01:26:18,200 --> 01:26:19,200
Mommy!
