1
00:00:25,925 --> 00:00:29,053
I guess the, uh,
"Honeymoon Suite" wasn't available?

2
00:00:29,129 --> 00:00:29,857
Shut up.

3
00:00:36,736 --> 00:00:37,828
So what now?

4
00:00:39,439 --> 00:00:44,206
I don't know. Me, you...
a nice big bed.

5
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:46,540
What do you think we're gonna do?

6
00:00:49,382 --> 00:00:50,644
We're gonna sleep.

7
00:00:53,286 --> 00:00:54,981
You trust me not to run away?

8
00:00:57,023 --> 00:00:59,890
No. Actually, I don't.

9
00:01:04,497 --> 00:01:07,295
These are military issue handcuffs.

10
00:01:08,401 --> 00:01:11,666
They can't be picked,
so don't bother trying.

11
00:01:22,816 --> 00:01:24,511
Now, I'm gonna go piss.

12
00:01:25,285 --> 00:01:26,616
Don't go anywhere.

13
00:01:54,848 --> 00:01:55,815
Nice!

14
00:01:59,419 --> 00:02:00,784
What do you think you're doing?

15
00:02:54,474 --> 00:02:57,204
So what's your name?

16
00:02:58,645 --> 00:03:00,203
That was "what's -your-name?"

17
00:03:05,552 --> 00:03:06,177
Trip.

18
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,718
Is that your Christian name?

19
00:03:08,021 --> 00:03:09,113
Who said I was a Christian?

20
00:03:09,355 --> 00:03:12,324
No. I mean, is that your given name,
or is it like a nickname?

21
00:03:12,725 --> 00:03:13,987
It's my name.

22
00:03:14,194 --> 00:03:16,321
I'm just makin' conversation.

23
00:03:16,563 --> 00:03:20,659
What is that, a map of Canada?
The fucking Canada!

24
00:03:21,401 --> 00:03:22,629
An airport.

25
00:03:22,869 --> 00:03:25,667
What kind of bank robber goes
to Canada to catch a plane?

26
00:03:26,139 --> 00:03:29,666
The kind who gets fed up real quick
with mouthy little girls.

27
00:03:29,909 --> 00:03:33,504
What? Two hours ago you said you
weren't even planning on taking a hostage,

28
00:03:33,613 --> 00:03:35,205
and now you've got duck tape?

29
00:03:35,415 --> 00:03:36,746
Plans change.

30
00:03:37,050 --> 00:03:38,278
Please, don't.

31
00:03:39,052 --> 00:03:41,020
My nose is stuffed up.

32
00:03:41,221 --> 00:03:43,121
I won't be able to breathe.

33
00:03:51,297 --> 00:03:53,026
Save your strength.

34
00:03:53,266 --> 00:03:55,325
We've got a long drive ahead
of us tomorrow.

35
00:03:57,270 --> 00:03:58,237
You comfortable?

36
00:03:58,404 --> 00:04:00,372
Don't you fucking touch me!

37
00:05:12,645 --> 00:05:16,411
I have to catch a 6:30 PM flight,
so we'll have to get on the road early.

38
00:05:21,154 --> 00:05:22,451
Good night.

39
00:06:46,606 --> 00:06:47,732
What the...

40
00:06:50,309 --> 00:06:51,276
gimme those!

41
00:06:55,815 --> 00:06:57,339
You didn't!!

42
00:07:00,820 --> 00:07:06,417
So now, you either leave me here,
or you miss your flight.

43
00:07:06,526 --> 00:07:07,493
I can't believe you!!!

44
00:07:07,760 --> 00:07:09,625
I don't wanna go to Canada.

45
00:07:13,232 --> 00:07:15,063
- Oh please. Put that away.
- Shut up!

46
00:07:15,301 --> 00:07:17,963
- I don't think you have the balls to...
- Shut up!

47
00:07:47,033 --> 00:07:53,233
You shot me in the fucking shoulder!

48
00:07:55,141 --> 00:07:56,631
Oh, I missed your mouth?

49
00:07:56,943 --> 00:07:58,044
It won't happen again.

50
00:07:58,044 --> 00:07:59,841
You fucking prick!!

51
00:08:00,146 --> 00:08:00,942
Shhhhh! Shut up!

52
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:01,536
Asshole!!

53
00:08:01,781 --> 00:08:02,645
God damn it, be quiet!

54
00:08:02,882 --> 00:08:05,043
If you wanted me to stay quiet maybe
you shouldna

55
00:08:05,151 --> 00:08:06,379
SHOT ME IN THE SHOULDER!

56
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,953
Shut the fuck up!!

57
00:08:10,356 --> 00:08:11,516
Where are you going?

58
00:08:11,757 --> 00:08:14,994
To see if there's an all-night
hardware store around,

59
00:08:14,994 --> 00:08:16,052
so I can get you outta those.

60
00:08:16,295 --> 00:08:18,024
But I thought you said
they couldn't be picked.

61
00:08:18,164 --> 00:08:20,325
I'll have to figure something out.

62
00:08:20,466 --> 00:08:23,060
I'm not missing my flight.

63
00:08:23,236 --> 00:08:24,965
And I'm not leaving without you.

64
00:08:25,104 --> 00:08:25,627
But, but, but...

65
00:08:25,838 --> 00:08:28,033
you can't just leave me here!

66
00:08:28,174 --> 00:08:29,471
Bleeding!

67
00:08:29,642 --> 00:08:33,339
I'll scream for help,
until somebody comes!

68
00:08:37,817 --> 00:08:39,182
What are you doing?

69
00:08:42,355 --> 00:08:46,985
Something I should have done hours ago.

70
00:08:50,263 --> 00:08:51,321
Hey!

71
00:08:52,031 --> 00:08:53,362
Now be still...

72
00:08:56,869 --> 00:08:58,803
Fuck you!!

73
00:08:58,938 --> 00:09:02,965
You just want me to lay still
so you can poison me?

74
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:04,406
It's not poison.

75
00:09:04,644 --> 00:09:08,045
Help me! Somebody help me!

76
00:09:08,281 --> 00:09:09,248
Shut up!

77
00:09:09,749 --> 00:09:13,776
God damn it, somebody help me!

78
00:09:14,086 --> 00:09:21,959
Owww!!! Oh my god,
you mean-ass sonofabitch!!

79
00:09:52,191 --> 00:09:55,160
Now just chill out.

80
00:10:05,571 --> 00:10:06,970
I'll be back.

81
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:11,503
We have to be on the road in three hours.

82
00:10:14,246 --> 00:10:15,713
Great.

83
00:11:11,470 --> 00:11:12,767
Drop the bag.

84
00:11:15,174 --> 00:11:16,505
Now let's see...

85
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:19,111
the girlie said you kept your gun...

86
00:11:20,479 --> 00:11:21,468
Right here.

87
00:11:21,714 --> 00:11:23,011
You bitch! Why didn't you warn me?

88
00:11:23,149 --> 00:11:27,108
Oh. Look out for the man
behind the... oh damn.

89
00:11:27,319 --> 00:11:29,378
Shut up, both of you.

90
00:11:35,161 --> 00:11:36,560
It's not loaded.

91
00:11:38,831 --> 00:11:40,025
It's not?

92
00:11:40,933 --> 00:11:43,026
Then what made the hole in her?

93
00:11:44,403 --> 00:11:49,033
If it's not loaded, then charge me.

94
00:11:57,516 --> 00:12:02,078
Ah, didn't think it through that far, huh?

95
00:12:07,526 --> 00:12:09,084
Take off your pants.

96
00:12:16,702 --> 00:12:19,038
What kind of a man shoots a girl
when she's already tied up?

97
00:12:19,038 --> 00:12:20,596
Yeah, fucker.

98
00:12:21,373 --> 00:12:23,341
You should at least
give 'em a running start.

99
00:12:26,312 --> 00:12:28,576
I prefer taking em' down with
a blade, myself.

100
00:12:51,637 --> 00:12:53,537
Gimme them pants, quick-draw.

101
00:13:25,805 --> 00:13:27,397
What am I supposed to wear?

102
00:13:28,040 --> 00:13:33,410
Well, I think you look
just precious like that, like you are.

103
00:13:51,197 --> 00:13:53,165
You assholes got anything to eat?

104
00:13:56,235 --> 00:14:01,172
No? Maybe we'll order some grub.

105
00:14:20,759 --> 00:14:24,388
What? Did you shoot the phone, too?

106
00:14:26,866 --> 00:14:29,198
Man, you sure thought of everything.

107
00:14:30,603 --> 00:14:32,798
Well, this sure puts us
in a fuckin' bind doesn't it?

108
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:36,835
We can't order any food in,
'cause we got no phone.

109
00:14:37,309 --> 00:14:38,867
And I can't leave you here,

110
00:14:39,378 --> 00:14:42,745
'cause you'll just get into
some kind of trouble or some shit.

111
00:14:51,457 --> 00:14:53,687
I guess that means we're all going
for a little trip.

112
00:14:56,962 --> 00:14:58,429
What? What's so funny?

113
00:14:58,597 --> 00:15:00,224
We can't go anywhere,

114
00:15:00,366 --> 00:15:02,994
'cause she swallowed the key
to the handcuffs.

115
00:15:03,102 --> 00:15:03,796
You did what?

116
00:15:03,903 --> 00:15:05,165
That's not why I'm laughing.

117
00:15:05,337 --> 00:15:07,100
Wait a minute,
you swallowed the fuckin' keys?

118
00:15:07,273 --> 00:15:10,003
You said "little trip."

119
00:15:10,276 --> 00:15:11,675
My name is "Trip."

120
00:15:11,844 --> 00:15:14,972
I just imagined
that's what you call your penis.

121
00:15:15,180 --> 00:15:16,841
"Little Trip."

122
00:15:33,399 --> 00:15:34,991
Now maybe I can think.

123
00:15:38,637 --> 00:15:40,002
I'm starving.

124
00:15:42,741 --> 00:15:44,504
Hey, what's in the bag?

125
00:15:49,181 --> 00:15:50,773
Definitely could'a used this last night!

126
00:15:56,288 --> 00:16:00,554
Now, why did you swallow the keys?

127
00:16:01,293 --> 00:16:04,387
'Cause I thought if I couldn't get loose,

128
00:16:04,630 --> 00:16:06,689
he'd have to leave me behind.

129
00:16:06,999 --> 00:16:08,591
So, you don't wanna be here?

130
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:12,463
Dumb question. Who are you?

131
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:13,672
My name is Sara.

132
00:16:13,906 --> 00:16:15,339
No, I mean, to him.

133
00:16:15,574 --> 00:16:16,404
What does he want with you?

134
00:16:16,642 --> 00:16:17,700
I don't know.

135
00:16:18,544 --> 00:16:21,206
You don... then why are you here?

136
00:16:21,447 --> 00:16:22,709
This is where he brought me...

137
00:16:23,015 --> 00:16:25,506
Agghhh!! Fuck!

138
00:16:26,485 --> 00:16:30,979
Are, are you trying to be difficult,

139
00:16:33,192 --> 00:16:35,683
or are you just really stupid?

140
00:16:48,741 --> 00:16:49,366
What is she doing here?

141
00:16:49,541 --> 00:16:51,008
She your girlfriend? What?

142
00:16:52,144 --> 00:16:53,634
She's my hostage.

143
00:16:54,546 --> 00:16:56,878
Well, she's not your hostage anymore.

144
00:16:57,316 --> 00:16:58,544
What are you talking about?

145
00:16:58,684 --> 00:16:59,446
You're both mine.

146
00:16:59,585 --> 00:17:01,212
No! You can't, you can't do that!

147
00:17:01,453 --> 00:17:03,182
It, it should... be like a food chain.

148
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:05,688
I'm your hostage, and she's my hostage!

149
00:17:05,891 --> 00:17:07,358
You can't take my hostage.

150
00:17:07,593 --> 00:17:09,128
What ever happened to
"honour among thieves?"

151
00:17:09,128 --> 00:17:12,291
Well, for one, I ain't no thief.

152
00:17:12,531 --> 00:17:16,763
And two, I can do anything
I want to right now.

153
00:17:18,737 --> 00:17:20,329
What do you need with a hostage, anyway?

154
00:17:20,472 --> 00:17:21,336
What do you need with two of them?

155
00:17:21,507 --> 00:17:23,270
I just escaped from prison.

156
00:17:23,842 --> 00:17:28,438
I need some good regular folks
to help me get around,

157
00:17:29,148 --> 00:17:32,709
and keep any deputies
from chargin' me with guns blazin'

158
00:17:32,785 --> 00:17:35,720
Well, you sure know how to pick 'em!

159
00:17:36,021 --> 00:17:37,648
He robbed a bank.

160
00:17:38,023 --> 00:17:38,421
'Sthat right?

161
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,456
Shut up!

162
00:17:39,858 --> 00:17:41,416
Boy, you need to learn some manners.

163
00:17:41,593 --> 00:17:42,719
I wasn't sayin' it to you,

164
00:17:42,828 --> 00:17:43,988
I was sayin' it to her!

165
00:17:44,129 --> 00:17:46,097
Don't matter. You're rude.

166
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:47,760
And I don't much care for it.

167
00:17:50,035 --> 00:17:54,768
Anything you do to her, from now on,
I'm gonna do it to you.

168
00:17:57,609 --> 00:17:59,406
So you're a bank robber, huh?

169
00:18:03,282 --> 00:18:04,510
Goddamn the luck.

170
00:18:05,150 --> 00:18:09,951
I finally get out
and I kidnap "Bonnie & Clyde."

171
00:18:11,557 --> 00:18:13,752
This is real fucked up, all right.

172
00:18:16,195 --> 00:18:19,790
She's gonna have to have that shoulder
looked at - it's not that bad,

173
00:18:19,898 --> 00:18:20,557
but if it get's infected...

174
00:18:20,732 --> 00:18:23,064
let's just say you're not gonna
get through a police roadblock

175
00:18:23,268 --> 00:18:26,601
with a girl who's crying,
or bleeding, or puking.

176
00:18:27,005 --> 00:18:29,132
So you fucked up real good there.

177
00:18:30,309 --> 00:18:34,609
Cops are looking for you,
so that doesn't do me any good.

178
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:38,105
So I gotta take her.
'Cept I ain't goin' near a hospital.

179
00:18:40,886 --> 00:18:43,980
Yeah, we got us a mess here.

180
00:18:49,027 --> 00:18:53,123
Jesse James, you're gonna have to fix her
- clean it, dress it.

181
00:18:53,265 --> 00:18:54,095
What?
What makes you think I know how to -

182
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,733
I don't care what you know.

183
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:57,194
We got a mess here.

184
00:18:57,436 --> 00:18:59,768
You made it. Clean it up.

185
00:20:03,368 --> 00:20:04,733
There, that looks great.

186
00:20:07,239 --> 00:20:08,570
I think you missed your calling.

187
00:20:12,744 --> 00:20:14,507
Man, if I don't get some food in me...

188
00:20:17,683 --> 00:20:21,084
Either one of you remember if
they got vending machines around here?

189
00:20:21,320 --> 00:20:23,413
You know, chips, soda, shit like that.

190
00:20:26,925 --> 00:20:27,482
Think!

191
00:20:27,593 --> 00:20:29,652
I think I saw one when we came in.

192
00:20:29,895 --> 00:20:31,055
By the pool.

193
00:20:31,296 --> 00:20:34,788
Thank you..."Sara" was it?

194
00:20:35,033 --> 00:20:36,557
Uh-huh.

195
00:20:37,636 --> 00:20:39,160
And "Trip"?

196
00:20:39,838 --> 00:20:44,832
Okay, "Trip," back in the toilet.

197
00:21:01,893 --> 00:21:03,417
Guess snacks are on Trip.

198
00:21:04,730 --> 00:21:06,095
You want anything?

199
00:21:07,366 --> 00:21:09,266
I'm kinda thirsty.

200
00:21:09,668 --> 00:21:15,368
Okay. Okay. I'll be back.

201
00:21:27,052 --> 00:21:28,212
That was stupid.

202
00:21:28,453 --> 00:21:29,477
What was?

203
00:21:29,955 --> 00:21:31,786
Telling him where the snack machine was.

204
00:21:32,057 --> 00:21:33,024
Why?

205
00:21:33,225 --> 00:21:36,820
Because if he's worried about being hungry,
he might make a mistake - slip up.

206
00:21:36,962 --> 00:21:38,862
And at least if he'd had to go look
for it himself,

207
00:21:39,164 --> 00:21:40,688
it would have bought us some time.

208
00:21:43,802 --> 00:21:45,292
How does he have the door braced?

209
00:21:45,971 --> 00:21:46,767
What?

210
00:21:46,938 --> 00:21:49,236
How is he locking me in here?
Describe it to me.

211
00:21:49,408 --> 00:21:50,306
Fuck you!

212
00:21:50,509 --> 00:21:51,032
Come on!

213
00:21:51,143 --> 00:21:54,772
No way! You kidnap me, and shoot me,

214
00:21:54,946 --> 00:21:59,212
and call me stupid,
and now you want me to help you?

215
00:22:01,453 --> 00:22:02,852
Not gonna happen.

216
00:22:03,121 --> 00:22:04,383
If we don't work together he's...

217
00:22:04,456 --> 00:22:05,980
Oh, nuh-uh, buddy.

218
00:22:06,758 --> 00:22:11,092
There is no "we." You're on your own.

219
00:22:13,532 --> 00:22:15,261
This guy is a... a...

220
00:22:16,435 --> 00:22:17,197
A what?

221
00:22:17,402 --> 00:22:19,529
I don't know what this guy is.

222
00:22:21,039 --> 00:22:23,007
I just know he's not you!

223
00:22:26,611 --> 00:22:28,602
What, you think you're safer with him
than you woulda been with me?

224
00:22:28,847 --> 00:22:31,008
He didn't shoot me!

225
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,146
It doesn't matter, anyway, does it?

226
00:22:34,386 --> 00:22:39,323
'Cause I'm with him now,
whether I like it or not.

227
00:22:39,558 --> 00:22:41,822
I'm not gonna
bust my ass escaping from him,

228
00:22:42,060 --> 00:22:43,925
just so I can be stuck with you.

229
00:22:44,162 --> 00:22:45,026
I'll make you a deal.

230
00:22:45,397 --> 00:22:51,358
No thanks. Fact of the matter is,
he really only needs one of us.

231
00:22:51,603 --> 00:22:54,663
And he seems to like me.

232
00:22:54,906 --> 00:22:55,930
For now...

233
00:22:56,174 --> 00:22:58,734
what do you think he'll do with
the one of us he doesn't take?

234
00:22:58,977 --> 00:22:59,636
I don't...

235
00:22:59,878 --> 00:23:03,405
I can't stop him from hurting you
if I'm dead.

236
00:23:19,898 --> 00:23:20,887
Here.

237
00:23:30,175 --> 00:23:31,267
You're very trusting.

238
00:23:35,280 --> 00:23:37,771
To just drink whatever I put
in front of you.

239
00:23:38,049 --> 00:23:39,277
I mean,
it's not like you've swallowed anything

240
00:23:39,418 --> 00:23:40,908
I might want you to puke up.

241
00:23:44,589 --> 00:23:47,251
maybe it was just soda.

242
00:23:57,602 --> 00:23:59,126
First thing's first.

243
00:24:00,906 --> 00:24:02,771
I'm gonna enjoy my dinner.

244
00:24:03,208 --> 00:24:06,974
Then, I'm gonna get me outta these.

245
00:24:07,779 --> 00:24:10,976
Then, I'm gonna get you outta those.

246
00:24:11,783 --> 00:24:15,275
You can't. They can't be picked.

247
00:24:15,520 --> 00:24:17,249
They're military issue.

248
00:24:18,657 --> 00:24:19,817
What?

249
00:24:20,225 --> 00:24:23,194
Mil-i-tar-y is-sue.

250
00:24:25,530 --> 00:24:26,861
Let me see that.

251
00:24:35,440 --> 00:24:38,898
Mmmm. You smell good.

252
00:24:42,447 --> 00:24:44,005
bet I can pick 'em.

253
00:24:45,550 --> 00:24:47,142
bet you can't.

254
00:24:48,153 --> 00:24:49,780
I just escaped from prison.

255
00:24:50,055 --> 00:24:52,489
You're trapped in a hotel bathroom.

256
00:24:53,558 --> 00:24:55,526
So, you wanna make a wager?

257
00:24:57,729 --> 00:24:58,718
Maybe.

258
00:25:00,098 --> 00:25:02,965
If you can't spring 'em,
you leave me and the girl here.

259
00:25:03,401 --> 00:25:05,266
It's not like we're gonna call the cops.

260
00:25:06,605 --> 00:25:08,300
What do I get if I win?

261
00:25:08,540 --> 00:25:11,304
It doesn't matter. They can't be picked.

262
00:25:12,210 --> 00:25:13,677
But what if?

263
00:25:14,012 --> 00:25:15,502
Your choice.

264
00:25:21,786 --> 00:25:23,378
You robbed a bank, huh?

265
00:25:27,325 --> 00:25:28,758
Let me think about it.

266
00:25:29,394 --> 00:25:32,727
Like I said... first thing's first.

267
00:25:39,037 --> 00:25:43,201
God almighty, I am free at last.

268
00:25:50,582 --> 00:25:51,708
That's a nice car, Trip.

269
00:25:51,950 --> 00:25:53,247
That's not his car.

270
00:25:53,752 --> 00:25:55,117
It's not?

271
00:26:21,780 --> 00:26:24,749
It's been so long since I smelled a woman.

272
00:26:27,652 --> 00:26:30,485
You don't mind if I just...
smell you for a little bit, do ya?

273
00:26:31,756 --> 00:26:33,087
Okay.

274
00:26:36,761 --> 00:26:38,228
What you doin' in there, boy?

275
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,567
Oh, now you're the strong, silent type, huh?

276
00:26:46,404 --> 00:26:47,837
Maybe he's hurt.

277
00:26:48,139 --> 00:26:51,233
Right. What did you two cook up
while I was gone?

278
00:26:51,476 --> 00:26:54,240
Huh? Guy goes to get a bite to eat...

279
00:26:57,949 --> 00:27:00,509
You come outta there. Now!

280
00:27:04,556 --> 00:27:05,580
Okay, fine.

281
00:27:05,824 --> 00:27:07,621
Maybe I'll just kill the blow-up doll, then.

282
00:27:10,328 --> 00:27:11,818
I'd knock that shit off.

283
00:27:12,097 --> 00:27:13,962
I ain't gonna shoot you in the shoulder.

284
00:27:16,101 --> 00:27:17,227
It's a shame.

285
00:27:17,535 --> 00:27:19,662
I bet you do more then smell good.

286
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:22,969
How you gonna live with yourself, junior,

287
00:27:23,141 --> 00:27:26,440
knowin' you coulda prevented this
by comin' outta the john?

288
00:27:27,345 --> 00:27:30,109
Well, if this is what you want!

289
00:27:39,491 --> 00:27:41,516
Okay, you win, don't hurt her.

290
00:27:43,528 --> 00:27:45,587
Awww! Loverboy to the rescue.

291
00:27:46,798 --> 00:27:49,596
On the floor.

292
00:27:59,444 --> 00:28:00,934
No. In back.

293
00:28:14,392 --> 00:28:15,518
Up.

294
00:28:23,401 --> 00:28:24,959
What was all that noise in here?

295
00:28:33,011 --> 00:28:39,541
Awww. That's so cuuute. Your first shiv.

296
00:28:42,320 --> 00:28:45,084
Of course,
you'd never get that past one of the guards.

297
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,808
You gotta be a lot more creative
on the inside.

298
00:29:10,081 --> 00:29:14,518
We don't have the luxury of mirrors,
and towels and shit.

299
00:29:15,820 --> 00:29:18,084
You know what makes a good shiv?

300
00:29:18,723 --> 00:29:20,156
A toothbrush.

301
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:24,826
You can sharpen the handle against
the edge of your bed frame.

302
00:29:25,997 --> 00:29:29,956
Fits in your shoe,
and metal detectors can't find it.

303
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:35,837
The best one I ever saw, though,
was made of soap.

304
00:29:36,207 --> 00:29:37,970
Swear to god.

305
00:29:38,209 --> 00:29:41,975
Guy sharpened it the same way,
against the frame of his bed.

306
00:29:43,681 --> 00:29:46,582
Never woulda thought the thing would
get so fuckin' sharp...

307
00:29:47,118 --> 00:29:48,517
but sure enough.

308
00:29:51,856 --> 00:29:55,189
Pried this dude's ribs apart, in the shower.

309
00:29:56,127 --> 00:30:00,996
And the beauty part was,
he left it under the running water,

310
00:30:01,232 --> 00:30:03,063
and they never found the weapon.

311
00:30:03,301 --> 00:30:05,428
It just melted away.

312
00:30:13,678 --> 00:30:17,409
Of course,
soap is good for so many things,

313
00:30:19,050 --> 00:30:20,540
besides cleaning, I mean.

314
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:24,850
After all, if you can bear
to part with one of your socks,

315
00:30:26,658 --> 00:30:32,528
you can make a nice...
"flail" I guess you'd call it.

316
00:30:34,399 --> 00:30:36,094
Packs a mean ol' punch.

317
00:30:41,339 --> 00:30:42,738
Fuck a guy up real good.

318
00:30:42,974 --> 00:30:43,906
And what can they do, right?

319
00:30:44,142 --> 00:30:45,632
They gotta give you socks and soap, right?

320
00:30:45,877 --> 00:30:50,837
That's what I thought
but some of the places now: boy,

321
00:30:51,316 --> 00:30:52,977
they thought of everything.

322
00:30:53,952 --> 00:30:55,977
They make everybody wear flip-flops.

323
00:30:57,088 --> 00:31:00,615
You tried out-running dogs in pursuit
in a pair of flip-flops?

324
00:31:01,459 --> 00:31:02,721
Ya can't do it.

325
00:31:04,162 --> 00:31:09,691
And some of these places,
they make guys wash with the liquid soap.

326
00:31:12,337 --> 00:31:14,305
That just doesn't seem right to me.

327
00:31:16,374 --> 00:31:18,001
I don't feel clean.

328
00:31:19,544 --> 00:31:27,451
Lucky me, my prison still had socks,
and good ol' bar soap.

329
00:31:39,530 --> 00:31:43,022
I've spent every day for the last ten years

330
00:31:43,601 --> 00:31:47,332
figurin' out new and better ways
to hurt people.

331
00:31:48,306 --> 00:31:50,467
Don't fuck with me.

332
00:32:12,297 --> 00:32:13,628
Now, where were we?

333
00:32:15,033 --> 00:32:16,762
Were you really going to kill me?

334
00:32:17,035 --> 00:32:18,900
He came out, I didn't have to.

335
00:32:19,437 --> 00:32:22,600
But, what if he hadn't?

336
00:32:23,608 --> 00:32:24,905
But he did.

337
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:41,520
What is it about me
you like smelling so much?

338
00:32:42,160 --> 00:32:52,035
Is it my hair? Or my skin? Or my perfume?

339
00:32:59,077 --> 00:33:00,601
The blood.

340
00:33:01,179 --> 00:33:02,237
Yeah.

341
00:33:03,348 --> 00:33:06,584
So... you were away for...

342
00:33:06,584 --> 00:33:08,142
Ten years.

343
00:33:09,654 --> 00:33:11,144
Are you married?

344
00:33:12,323 --> 00:33:13,688
What kind of question is that?

345
00:33:13,925 --> 00:33:18,362
Well, if you were,
at least you could have conjugal visits.

346
00:33:22,033 --> 00:33:24,092
What do you know about conjugal visits?

347
00:33:24,302 --> 00:33:25,564
I know enough.

348
00:33:27,505 --> 00:33:36,607
I know ten years is a long time
to go without... the company of a woman.

349
00:33:37,215 --> 00:33:39,115
Oh, oh oh oh oh ohohoh.

350
00:33:41,819 --> 00:33:43,514
You're an expert on a lot of things.

351
00:33:43,755 --> 00:33:45,347
I'm just saying...

352
00:33:45,590 --> 00:33:47,114
Oh, I hear ya.

353
00:33:48,159 --> 00:33:50,286
Are you "offering" yourself to me?

354
00:33:51,295 --> 00:33:52,660
Maybe...

355
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:04,708
Why?

356
00:34:07,712 --> 00:34:11,808
Did my... roughin' up the "Tripster"
get you all hot?

357
00:34:12,784 --> 00:34:14,843
Maybe I just want him to hear us.

358
00:34:15,119 --> 00:34:18,987
I see... punish him, so he doesn't
think you owe him or nothing?

359
00:34:19,724 --> 00:34:21,282
Is that it?

360
00:34:25,596 --> 00:34:32,001
Bet you couldn't get a piece of ass
like this in prison.

361
00:34:35,339 --> 00:34:37,364
You take a whole lot for granted, huh?

362
00:34:38,843 --> 00:34:40,310
What do you mean?

363
00:34:48,286 --> 00:34:50,254
Well, you're quick on your feet.

364
00:34:51,189 --> 00:34:53,885
But you say things
without thinkin' em through.

365
00:34:54,158 --> 00:34:55,216
What?

366
00:34:56,561 --> 00:35:00,463
You think, by letting me fuck you,

367
00:35:00,798 --> 00:35:05,861
you're gonna..."win my favor",
so nothing bad will happen to you.

368
00:35:08,005 --> 00:35:09,802
Not necessarily.

369
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,269
You're handcuffed to the bed.

370
00:35:12,510 --> 00:35:18,779
If I wanted to fuck you,
I would with or without your blessing.

371
00:35:20,518 --> 00:35:25,080
You also take for granted that
I would want a "piece of ass" like you.

372
00:35:27,158 --> 00:35:29,524
Maybe I like humping men.

373
00:35:32,463 --> 00:35:35,899
Maybe I got all the ass I needed
when I was locked up.

374
00:35:37,535 --> 00:35:41,494
You also make the illogical
jump that says,

375
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:47,200
if I like fucking you I won't kill you.

376
00:35:49,847 --> 00:35:51,872
You don't know that.

377
00:35:53,784 --> 00:36:00,087
Maybe what I like is fucking a girl,
and cutting her head off.

378
00:36:01,192 --> 00:36:03,820
Or cutting her head off,
and then fucking her.

379
00:36:05,997 --> 00:36:07,692
You don't know anything about me.

380
00:36:08,533 --> 00:36:10,524
You don't seem like the type.

381
00:36:14,005 --> 00:36:19,102
Well, you don't seem like the type who
would offer herself to a psychopath,

382
00:36:25,183 --> 00:36:26,844
but you just did it.

383
00:36:32,623 --> 00:36:37,185
What you do seem like is a liar.

384
00:36:41,199 --> 00:36:43,258
Why do you say that?

385
00:36:44,735 --> 00:36:46,168
Who is Aria Giovanni?

386
00:36:46,404 --> 00:36:47,132
What?

387
00:36:47,371 --> 00:36:49,669
Aria Giovanni. Who is she?

388
00:36:51,175 --> 00:36:52,870
I don't know.

389
00:36:53,144 --> 00:36:54,202
You don't?

390
00:36:55,379 --> 00:37:03,548
That's funny, because that's who your car
is registered to.

391
00:37:04,822 --> 00:37:11,625
Now, either your name isn't Sara,
or that's not really your car.

392
00:37:14,165 --> 00:37:18,864
And from the look on your face,
I'd say that's not your car.

393
00:37:25,676 --> 00:37:30,978
Kidnapping 101:
never take a hostage in a stolen car.

394
00:37:32,883 --> 00:37:35,750
Apparently,
something "dipshit" in there overlooked.

395
00:37:37,121 --> 00:37:38,986
We're not going to get very far
in that car.

396
00:37:39,156 --> 00:37:40,851
It... it's my sister's.

397
00:37:41,125 --> 00:37:45,619
Bullshit. You just said you didn't know
who she was.

398
00:37:46,163 --> 00:37:49,621
I - I just didn't want her
to get dragged into this.

399
00:37:49,867 --> 00:37:50,993
Dragged into what?

400
00:37:51,202 --> 00:37:53,295
See, either you're lying now,

401
00:37:53,537 --> 00:37:55,869
or you were lying then, or both, or...

402
00:37:57,808 --> 00:37:58,900
I don't know.

403
00:37:59,343 --> 00:38:02,506
You're a liar, so you might as well not
even open your mouth anymore.

404
00:38:02,847 --> 00:38:03,336
Let me expl...

405
00:38:03,581 --> 00:38:04,946
Shut it.

406
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:11,778
You still got any o' them snacks?

407
00:38:13,624 --> 00:38:14,784
What!?

408
00:38:15,192 --> 00:38:17,183
I'm, I'm starving in here.

409
00:38:17,828 --> 00:38:20,058
Can I get a bag of chips or something?

410
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,402
If I pass out,
you'll have to lug my body around.

411
00:38:26,637 --> 00:38:29,663
Yeah, and if I kill you,
I got the same problem,

412
00:38:29,907 --> 00:38:31,465
except that you'll stay quiet.

413
00:38:50,494 --> 00:38:52,325
What are you doin' stealin' a car?

414
00:38:53,030 --> 00:38:55,658
Nah, fuck it. You'll probably just lie anyway.

415
00:39:02,673 --> 00:39:04,937
I'm going to go move that car
a few blocks from here.

416
00:39:07,778 --> 00:39:09,302
You two behave.

417
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,656
A car ride to Canada is starting
not to sound so bad, huh?

418
00:39:21,892 --> 00:39:22,950
Fuck off.

419
00:39:23,160 --> 00:39:26,527
We can get out of this.
You do want out of this, don't you?

420
00:39:26,764 --> 00:39:27,753
Shut up.

421
00:39:28,099 --> 00:39:30,067
You're not on his "favorite people"
list anymore.

422
00:39:30,301 --> 00:39:32,496
I'd still rather be me than you.

423
00:39:32,737 --> 00:39:37,071
Right, but if we're us, we can beat him.

424
00:39:37,775 --> 00:39:39,110
He's just one guy.

425
00:39:39,110 --> 00:39:42,102
Yeah, one guy who's got me chained
to a bed...

426
00:39:42,780 --> 00:39:44,873
and you're doing a real bang-up job
from in there.

427
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:48,152
We've got the upper hand here.
He's got the police looking for him.

428
00:39:48,152 --> 00:39:49,312
He's got to get moving.
He can't sit still.

429
00:39:49,387 --> 00:39:53,153
So do we. You robbed a bank, remember?

430
00:39:53,290 --> 00:39:54,024
You just said "we."

431
00:39:54,024 --> 00:39:55,218
I meant you.

432
00:39:55,860 --> 00:39:57,088
The point is, when he realizes
he can't take us with him

433
00:39:57,294 --> 00:40:00,320
because of those handcuffs
he'll have to leave us.

434
00:40:00,564 --> 00:40:03,863
Or leave me here. And take you.

435
00:40:04,101 --> 00:40:05,363
He won't do that.

436
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:10,571
So what's your plan?

437
00:40:12,376 --> 00:40:13,900
I'm just gonna talk to him.

438
00:40:14,145 --> 00:40:16,010
Genius.

439
00:40:19,417 --> 00:40:25,253
Hey, uh... thanks. For earlier.

440
00:40:25,790 --> 00:40:27,348
For what?

441
00:40:27,992 --> 00:40:29,653
For coming out.

442
00:40:30,027 --> 00:40:32,325
When he was gonna shoot me.

443
00:40:33,597 --> 00:40:39,797
You didn't have to do that, so thanks.

444
00:40:40,037 --> 00:40:43,700
Yes I did... I kidnapped you first.

445
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:04,394
They sure get the paper out early here,
don't they?

446
00:41:04,462 --> 00:41:06,123
Hey, guy?

447
00:41:06,363 --> 00:41:07,523
You didn't pass out yet?

448
00:41:07,598 --> 00:41:09,361
You ready to try the handcuffs?

449
00:41:12,503 --> 00:41:13,333
What?

450
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:14,994
Our bet.

451
00:41:15,873 --> 00:41:18,000
You said you thought you could pick 'em,

452
00:41:18,175 --> 00:41:20,268
and I say you can't.

453
00:41:20,644 --> 00:41:22,839
I don't need to.
I can cut her loose with this shit.

454
00:41:23,147 --> 00:41:24,444
Where's the sport in that?

455
00:41:24,682 --> 00:41:26,377
This ain't about sport, fella.

456
00:41:27,251 --> 00:41:29,378
I don't have time for sports.

457
00:41:30,154 --> 00:41:31,883
I gotta be movin' on outta here,
right quick.

458
00:41:32,156 --> 00:41:35,557
Well,
I guess you better get movin' then, huh?

459
00:41:35,893 --> 00:41:39,021
So grab your gunshot car thief,
and hop in your stolen automobile,

460
00:41:39,263 --> 00:41:41,561
and live happily ever after.

461
00:41:41,799 --> 00:41:45,758
Or would you rather grab the wanted
bank robber and hit the road?

462
00:41:46,070 --> 00:41:48,903
Either way, you won't get very far.

463
00:41:49,173 --> 00:41:51,505
You'd be better off starting from scratch.

464
00:41:52,943 --> 00:41:54,877
What bank did you rob?

465
00:41:56,347 --> 00:41:57,279
What?

466
00:41:58,082 --> 00:42:00,141
What bank did you rob?

467
00:42:01,385 --> 00:42:02,647
I wanna see if you're in the paper.

468
00:42:02,887 --> 00:42:04,115
Why? They got something?

469
00:42:04,355 --> 00:42:06,983
Maybe. Which bank was it?

470
00:42:08,559 --> 00:42:12,188
Oh, so you're a modest bank robber?

471
00:42:14,031 --> 00:42:15,498
How refreshing.

472
00:42:50,768 --> 00:42:52,030
What are you doing?

473
00:42:53,971 --> 00:42:55,131
Trying to figure out...

474
00:42:56,240 --> 00:42:57,707
Just exactly where...

475
00:42:58,242 --> 00:42:59,800
I'd have to punch you...

476
00:43:01,245 --> 00:43:03,076
Get you to spit up those keys.

477
00:43:04,481 --> 00:43:07,279
I know you're a filthy liar.

478
00:43:08,385 --> 00:43:12,082
You can't help it: you're a woman.

479
00:43:13,624 --> 00:43:15,455
I don't want to fuck you.

480
00:43:16,126 --> 00:43:20,085
And, while,
I would like to kill you very much,

481
00:43:23,834 --> 00:43:28,203
I won't. If you can help me.

482
00:43:28,439 --> 00:43:31,567
Help you how?

483
00:43:34,845 --> 00:43:38,008
Tell me what you know. About Trip.

484
00:43:39,750 --> 00:43:41,115
Just met him yesterday.

485
00:43:41,318 --> 00:43:43,718
Just tell me what you've noticed
in that one day, then.

486
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,320
How was he in the bank? How did he work?

487
00:43:47,291 --> 00:43:48,019
I don't know.

488
00:43:48,258 --> 00:43:49,418
Too... what?

489
00:43:49,660 --> 00:43:52,151
Too scared? Too much going on?

490
00:43:52,396 --> 00:43:53,294
Didn't have a good look at him?

491
00:43:53,530 --> 00:43:56,021
No. I wasn't there.

492
00:43:57,501 --> 00:43:58,593
You weren't?

493
00:43:58,836 --> 00:44:01,066
No, he kidnapped me later.

494
00:44:05,442 --> 00:44:08,707
What, like car-jacked you?

495
00:44:10,381 --> 00:44:11,575
Pretty much.

496
00:44:12,349 --> 00:44:13,816
Where was this at?

497
00:44:14,451 --> 00:44:16,214
Just a couple of miles from here.

498
00:44:18,455 --> 00:44:19,319
What did he say?

499
00:44:19,590 --> 00:44:20,079
When?

500
00:44:20,257 --> 00:44:21,554
When he got in your car.

501
00:44:21,792 --> 00:44:24,317
He told me not to move,
and not to scream.

502
00:44:25,262 --> 00:44:26,194
Or what?

503
00:44:26,530 --> 00:44:27,895
He didn't say.

504
00:44:29,166 --> 00:44:30,690
Did he drive, or did you?

505
00:44:31,035 --> 00:44:32,332
He did.

506
00:44:39,209 --> 00:44:41,006
Did he tell you he robbed a bank?

507
00:44:42,846 --> 00:44:44,108
Yes.

508
00:44:46,517 --> 00:44:48,212
How was he? Was he calm?

509
00:44:48,452 --> 00:44:49,544
Did he seem agitated?

510
00:44:49,787 --> 00:44:51,118
He was pretty cool.

511
00:44:56,160 --> 00:44:57,559
Were you scared?

512
00:44:58,662 --> 00:45:00,061
Not at first.

513
00:45:04,268 --> 00:45:06,259
Did he have the money with him?

514
00:45:06,704 --> 00:45:10,401
He wasn't carrying anything,
except the gun.

515
00:45:14,745 --> 00:45:16,178
Oh...

516
00:45:22,286 --> 00:45:23,548
This gun?

517
00:45:36,533 --> 00:45:38,364
They say, when you've got a gun,

518
00:45:38,902 --> 00:45:40,802
and you really intend to use it,

519
00:45:41,038 --> 00:45:43,199
it's not like carrying anything at all.

520
00:45:44,374 --> 00:45:46,001
It becomes an extension of your body.

521
00:45:46,243 --> 00:45:50,111
Like your arm. Or your cock.

522
00:45:52,916 --> 00:45:58,115
You tell me: does this feel like
I'm rubbing a gun on your face?

523
00:46:00,390 --> 00:46:02,620
Or does it feel like...
a part of my body?

524
00:46:05,295 --> 00:46:07,160
I know how it feels, to me.

525
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:10,866
Kiss it. Go on.

526
00:46:19,576 --> 00:46:22,739
Nooo, you can do better than that.

527
00:46:23,714 --> 00:46:27,707
Take it in your mouth.

528
00:46:39,196 --> 00:46:40,993
Let's just hope it doesn't feel too good,

529
00:46:41,198 --> 00:46:44,895
'cause if this shoots in your mouth,
you have no choice but to swallow.

530
00:46:50,040 --> 00:46:52,838
I see he's got an atlas out over there
- did he say where he was going?

531
00:46:53,610 --> 00:46:55,339
Oh yeah, where?

532
00:46:55,579 --> 00:46:56,807
CANADA.

533
00:46:58,182 --> 00:46:59,911
What's that? "Canada?"

534
00:47:03,887 --> 00:47:05,787
What the fuck is in Canada?

535
00:47:09,493 --> 00:47:11,188
You know what the difference is?

536
00:47:12,329 --> 00:47:16,629
With a cock in her mouth,
a girl can't help but lie to you.

537
00:47:21,471 --> 00:47:22,836
But, put a gun in her mouth,

538
00:47:23,106 --> 00:47:26,701
and you can be sure even the worst lying
bitch will tell you the truth,

539
00:47:27,010 --> 00:47:29,240
swear to fuckin' god.

540
00:47:56,373 --> 00:47:57,704
What's he gonna do in Canada?

541
00:47:59,176 --> 00:48:00,643
He's catching a plane.

542
00:48:01,845 --> 00:48:06,145
Oh, so he's got his whole escape planned,
huh?

543
00:48:06,383 --> 00:48:07,782
I guess.

544
00:48:10,988 --> 00:48:12,785
Did he say
where he had hidden the money?

545
00:48:13,323 --> 00:48:14,790
Not to me.

546
00:48:19,563 --> 00:48:26,366
Okay, Sara, you find out
where he's got that money hidden,

547
00:48:26,737 --> 00:48:34,269
and where he's flyin' off to,
I won't kill you.

548
00:48:36,613 --> 00:48:38,342
You think you can do that?

549
00:48:41,184 --> 00:48:42,583
What if he won't tell me?

550
00:48:47,557 --> 00:48:49,718
Then what good are you to me?

551
00:49:10,747 --> 00:49:11,941
Damn, that was hot!

552
00:49:13,650 --> 00:49:15,049
I need a shower.

553
00:49:15,419 --> 00:49:17,410
Well, I needed one anyway, but...

554
00:49:27,230 --> 00:49:30,222
I'm gonna bring him out here,
and you go to work.

555
00:49:32,703 --> 00:49:36,070
How am I supposed to ask him things
if you cover my mouth?

556
00:49:38,175 --> 00:49:40,473
We don't want to seem obvious, do we?

557
00:49:56,693 --> 00:50:01,426
Now don't get any crazy ideas,

558
00:50:02,799 --> 00:50:04,994
'cause I'm just gonna be
in the next room.

559
00:50:05,702 --> 00:50:08,000
And I ain't gonna be gone that long.

560
00:50:12,509 --> 00:50:15,603
All right, potty-man,
I need you to clear out.

561
00:50:15,846 --> 00:50:18,781
My days of showering in front of
other men are long gone.

562
00:50:26,890 --> 00:50:29,188
I'm gonna chain you up there
with the girlfriend,

563
00:50:30,427 --> 00:50:32,054
as soon as I can find...

564
00:50:40,070 --> 00:50:41,367
Where's the gun?

565
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,301
You lost, so just...

566
00:50:48,211 --> 00:50:49,872
Tell me where the gun is.

567
00:50:54,418 --> 00:50:57,114
Motherfucker! Where's the gun!?

568
00:50:57,587 --> 00:50:59,817
Sara, what did he do with the gun?

569
00:51:01,925 --> 00:51:03,722
We're gonna do it like this?

570
00:51:10,367 --> 00:51:12,130
I got all night to kick your ass.

571
00:51:16,039 --> 00:51:17,233
Where's the gun!?

572
00:51:20,477 --> 00:51:24,709
I hate... HATE... repeating myself.

573
00:51:25,215 --> 00:51:27,877
Wherever it is, I'm going to get to
it before you, got it?

574
00:51:28,952 --> 00:51:30,681
And what would you do if you had it?

575
00:51:30,921 --> 00:51:33,856
You couldn't even aim it at me,
what with your little jewelry on there.

576
00:51:35,258 --> 00:51:37,590
And I don't need a gun to end you,
anyway.

577
00:51:38,195 --> 00:51:39,594
So what are we doing?

578
00:51:39,830 --> 00:51:41,127
This is not productive.

579
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:44,026
For the last time:
where the hell is the...

580
00:52:28,278 --> 00:52:30,178
I'd like to give you an "A" for effort.

581
00:52:31,181 --> 00:52:32,546
But instead...

582
00:52:40,957 --> 00:52:45,394
I'm gonna let you two fight it out
for a bit while I take a shower.

583
00:53:39,449 --> 00:53:41,110
Now, you two play nice.

584
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:50,584
Under the bed. Jesus Christ.

585
00:54:08,445 --> 00:54:10,072
God damn it!

586
00:54:12,015 --> 00:54:14,415
Oh, here. Let me help you.

587
00:54:28,565 --> 00:54:30,294
Can you move your head to my hands?

588
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,430
USE YOUR TEETH.

589
00:54:34,671 --> 00:54:35,695
What?

590
00:54:35,939 --> 00:54:36,701
YOUR TEETH.

591
00:54:36,940 --> 00:54:37,406
My what?

592
00:54:37,641 --> 00:54:38,608
TEETH!

593
00:54:38,842 --> 00:54:40,002
My feet?

594
00:54:42,045 --> 00:54:44,275
Oh, my teeth!

595
00:54:59,963 --> 00:55:01,191
What was that for?

596
00:55:01,431 --> 00:55:02,489
Are you complaining?

597
00:55:02,732 --> 00:55:03,960
No, I just...

598
00:55:13,877 --> 00:55:15,310
Don't leave me.

599
00:55:15,545 --> 00:55:16,671
I won't.

600
00:55:17,013 --> 00:55:18,378
I'm so scared.

601
00:55:19,149 --> 00:55:20,844
What did he do? Are you okay?

602
00:55:21,117 --> 00:55:22,982
Trip, I'm just so scared.

603
00:55:23,186 --> 00:55:24,710
It's okay. It's okay.

604
00:55:25,822 --> 00:55:27,119
We'll get out of this.

605
00:55:27,357 --> 00:55:30,884
Please - I'll come with you,
whatever you want.

606
00:55:31,161 --> 00:55:32,685
I just don't want to die.

607
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:34,260
I won't let you.

608
00:55:34,831 --> 00:55:36,731
What were you planning to do with me?

609
00:55:37,033 --> 00:55:38,261
Before he showed up...

610
00:55:38,501 --> 00:55:40,492
why did you kidnap me?

611
00:55:41,705 --> 00:55:43,195
Panic, I guess.

612
00:55:43,440 --> 00:55:49,242
If the cops got close to me,
I'd have... some leverage.

613
00:55:49,479 --> 00:55:50,639
Would you have killed me?

614
00:55:50,814 --> 00:55:56,719
No. Never. I might threaten to -
make them think I was gonna.

615
00:55:57,220 --> 00:55:58,847
But I would never do that.

616
00:55:59,155 --> 00:56:00,588
I wouldn't hurt you.

617
00:56:01,091 --> 00:56:04,686
Other than shooting me, you mean.

618
00:56:07,664 --> 00:56:14,331
Yeah, that. That was... that was dumb.

619
00:56:15,405 --> 00:56:16,497
I'm sorry.

620
00:56:18,274 --> 00:56:20,606
Where you flying to? From Canada?

621
00:56:23,146 --> 00:56:24,443
Someplace warm.

622
00:56:25,248 --> 00:56:28,081
Sounds nice. How far you takin' me?

623
00:56:29,719 --> 00:56:31,983
After all this,
you're not gonna wanna see me ever again.

624
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:36,158
If you get me outta this,
I promise I'll go anywhere with you.

625
00:56:37,827 --> 00:56:39,658
I don't got shit here, anyway.

626
00:56:39,896 --> 00:56:41,454
Not even a car.

627
00:56:42,866 --> 00:56:44,390
I think he's gonna kill me.

628
00:56:46,436 --> 00:56:48,301
Not if I have anything to say about it.

629
00:56:48,538 --> 00:56:49,368
Who said you will?

630
00:56:49,606 --> 00:56:53,269
If he was gonna kill you,
I think he'd have done it already.

631
00:56:53,510 --> 00:56:56,479
He's just a mean prick
who likes scaring us.

632
00:56:56,713 --> 00:56:58,874
I think I know
why he hasn't killed me yet.

633
00:56:59,149 --> 00:57:01,777
He wants your money.

634
00:57:03,386 --> 00:57:04,444
My money?

635
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:05,585
The money you stole.

636
00:57:05,822 --> 00:57:07,153
When you robbed the bank.

637
00:57:07,390 --> 00:57:10,257
I think he thinks I can get it from you.

638
00:57:11,828 --> 00:57:15,594
Well, he's barking up the wrong tree.

639
00:57:15,732 --> 00:57:16,960
Maybe.

640
00:57:17,167 --> 00:57:18,691
But if I don't figure out something
to tell him,

641
00:57:18,835 --> 00:57:20,530
so he thinks I'm...

642
00:57:20,737 --> 00:57:24,605
so he thinks I'm working on you,
then I'm screwed.

643
00:57:24,808 --> 00:57:27,208
Well, Sara, I got nothing to tell you.

644
00:57:27,677 --> 00:57:29,110
No. I know.

645
00:57:29,345 --> 00:57:31,973
You wouldn't, I mean, why would you?

646
00:57:32,148 --> 00:57:33,172
I wouldn't expect...

647
00:57:33,416 --> 00:57:34,405
that's not what I was...

648
00:57:34,651 --> 00:57:35,276
It's not that.

649
00:57:35,518 --> 00:57:36,678
This isn't the movies.

650
00:57:36,920 --> 00:57:39,320
The bad guy doesn't really
spell out his whole -

651
00:57:39,556 --> 00:57:40,215
not that you're the bad guy -

652
00:57:40,457 --> 00:57:41,355
I could tell him not to hurt you.

653
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:43,218
That I won't cooperate unless
he promises...

654
00:57:43,326 --> 00:57:45,988
You can't do that. You can't tell him that.

655
00:57:46,162 --> 00:57:49,996
He can't know that. Please.

656
00:57:50,099 --> 00:57:51,623
So what do you wanna do?

657
00:57:51,868 --> 00:57:57,704
I don't know. I just wish...

658
00:57:57,941 --> 00:57:58,407
What?

659
00:57:58,475 --> 00:58:04,675
I, well...
we could put our heads together except...

660
00:58:04,981 --> 00:58:07,643
there's nothing in mine. So to speak.

661
00:58:07,984 --> 00:58:09,781
I'm at a disadvantage.

662
00:58:10,153 --> 00:58:13,418
Okay, okay. I - who cares if I did or not...

663
00:58:13,756 --> 00:58:14,950
If there was something to tell...

664
00:58:15,158 --> 00:58:16,489
What do you mean?

665
00:58:18,428 --> 00:58:21,556
I'm gonna level with you because
I can't help you the way you want:

666
00:58:23,633 --> 00:58:26,659
there is no money. I don't have it.

667
00:58:27,003 --> 00:58:28,231
I have no access to it. It's not mine.

668
00:58:28,471 --> 00:58:31,963
I can't tell anyone where to go get it,
because I don't know where it is.

669
00:58:32,208 --> 00:58:32,697
Really?

670
00:58:32,842 --> 00:58:34,173
So, I don't have anything to tell you.

671
00:58:34,344 --> 00:58:35,504
Or him. Or anybody.

672
00:58:35,645 --> 00:58:37,078
So, what am I supposed to do now?

673
00:58:37,146 --> 00:58:38,078
I'm dead.

674
00:58:39,015 --> 00:58:40,209
Lie to him.

675
00:58:42,252 --> 00:58:43,412
But I'm not a good liar.

676
00:58:43,653 --> 00:58:46,087
Sure you are. We all are.

677
00:58:46,256 --> 00:58:47,655
It's evolution.

678
00:58:49,025 --> 00:58:49,855
Stall.

679
00:58:49,926 --> 00:58:51,791
Drag it out as long as you can,
until we get an opportunit...

680
00:58:51,861 --> 00:58:53,294
Shut up. Look.

681
00:58:54,330 --> 00:58:55,558
Where? What?

682
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,433
Up there. His knife. In the wall.

683
00:58:58,768 --> 00:58:59,325
So?

684
00:58:59,469 --> 00:59:01,369
We're down here.

685
00:59:01,604 --> 00:59:05,040
I think I can reach it. With my feet.

686
00:59:26,763 --> 00:59:27,821
There.

687
00:59:28,731 --> 00:59:29,789
What are you gonna do with that?

688
00:59:30,099 --> 00:59:31,157
Go to work on the handcuffs.

689
00:59:31,401 --> 00:59:32,231
But they can't be picked.

690
00:59:32,468 --> 00:59:34,299
Mine. But not yours.

691
00:59:34,537 --> 00:59:35,196
But with that?

692
00:59:35,438 --> 00:59:37,065
What would you suggest I use?

693
00:59:37,273 --> 00:59:38,069
Now hold still.

694
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:39,241
No, no. Give it to me.

695
00:59:39,309 --> 00:59:39,809
No way.

696
00:59:39,809 --> 00:59:41,640
What do you know about picking locks?

697
00:59:41,711 --> 00:59:43,042
Ow, shit!

698
00:59:45,014 --> 00:59:46,242
Fuck!

699
00:59:51,888 --> 00:59:59,420
AAAAAAGGGGHHHHHH!!

700
00:59:59,529 --> 01:00:00,894
Fuck!

701
01:00:06,035 --> 01:00:07,400
You can pull your hand out now!

702
01:00:10,139 --> 01:00:11,436
What did you do?

703
01:00:14,177 --> 01:00:16,543
YOU CUT OFF MY THUMB!!!

704
01:00:17,880 --> 01:00:19,404
You're out, aren't you!?

705
01:00:19,582 --> 01:00:21,846
Oh, fuck! I need the ice bucket!

706
01:00:22,118 --> 01:00:23,019
Ice bucket!!

707
01:00:23,019 --> 01:00:28,286
Fucking ice...

708
01:00:28,391 --> 01:00:30,552
this fucking place doesn't have
A FUCKING ICE BUCKET!!!

709
01:00:30,693 --> 01:00:31,660
Where's my thumb!?

710
01:00:31,928 --> 01:00:35,056
Where's my thumb!? Where's my thumb!?

711
01:00:35,264 --> 01:00:35,730
No...

712
01:00:35,965 --> 01:00:37,523
Gimme my thumb.

713
01:00:42,271 --> 01:00:45,729
THAT'S FOR SHOOTING ME,
YOU FUCKING PRICK!!

714
01:00:45,942 --> 01:00:49,935
And bringing me here
with a fucking psycho

715
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:55,048
who wants to kill me because
you don't have any money!!

716
01:00:58,521 --> 01:01:01,786
You fucking twisted fucking cunt!

717
01:01:02,458 --> 01:01:04,153
I thought I told you assholes to behave!

718
01:01:04,260 --> 01:01:06,285
what're you doin'
makin' a mess, and noise!? Jesus!

719
01:01:07,864 --> 01:01:10,389
She cut off my fucking thumb.

720
01:01:18,808 --> 01:01:21,368
I don't want you bleedin' all over me
after my bath.

721
01:01:23,379 --> 01:01:24,004
Where's the thumb?

722
01:01:24,213 --> 01:01:26,010
SHE ATE IT!!!

723
01:01:47,070 --> 01:01:48,332
Looks good.

724
01:03:18,761 --> 01:03:21,161
You got one hell of an oral fixation, huh?

725
01:03:23,699 --> 01:03:27,726
Tell me: did you like it?

726
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:31,230
Cutting into his flesh?

727
01:03:32,141 --> 01:03:34,166
Severing a part of him.

728
01:03:35,044 --> 01:03:40,573
Destroying some of god's handiwork -
even if he's not the best example of it.

729
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:50,117
Gotta admit, it never occurred
to me to eat off o' someone,

730
01:03:51,460 --> 01:03:54,122
though. Man, that's wild.

731
01:05:00,463 --> 01:05:04,763
I think it started for me
when I was a little kid.

732
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:12,500
I'd take a razor,
or scissors, or whatever...

733
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:22,644
and cut into myself, just a little bit.

734
01:05:25,121 --> 01:05:27,555
Cut into my arm until it stung.

735
01:05:32,929 --> 01:05:34,863
I didn't like the hurt.

736
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,366
It was the cutting I liked.

737
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:42,670
It's like jerkin' off in a way.

738
01:05:43,172 --> 01:05:47,131
Sure it feels good,
but I'm doin' all the work, ya know?

739
01:05:51,047 --> 01:05:56,144
Don't with someone else -
that's the way to go.

740
01:05:59,588 --> 01:06:03,684
And you, the little cannibal.

741
01:06:04,260 --> 01:06:06,319
You're into a whole different thing.

742
01:06:39,662 --> 01:06:40,754
Come here.

743
01:06:43,933 --> 01:06:46,231
I been chokin' on my own blood
my whole life -

744
01:06:48,237 --> 01:06:50,535
to the point
where I can't stand the taste.

745
01:06:53,242 --> 01:06:55,574
But I wonder how it tastes
to someone else.

746
01:06:57,413 --> 01:06:59,404
Someone as sick as me.

747
01:07:17,500 --> 01:07:18,762
Oh, I see.

748
01:07:21,737 --> 01:07:24,535
You want Trip inside you, but not me.

749
01:07:33,015 --> 01:07:34,539
I guess it's time for you to go.

750
01:07:34,650 --> 01:07:36,709
DON'T YOU WANNA KNOW WHAT
I FOUND OUT!?

751
01:07:37,420 --> 01:07:39,980
Oh, yeah. That. Whatchu got?

752
01:07:40,189 --> 01:07:41,747
There is no money.

753
01:07:42,024 --> 01:07:43,321
He doesn't have it.

754
01:07:43,559 --> 01:07:45,151
He doesn't... even know where it is.

755
01:07:45,327 --> 01:07:46,658
Thank you. That was very informative.

756
01:07:46,829 --> 01:07:48,091
NO, WAIT!

757
01:07:48,631 --> 01:07:49,791
Now what?

758
01:07:50,032 --> 01:07:51,158
Don't you think that's weird?

759
01:07:51,400 --> 01:07:54,096
Everything about him...
and you... is weird.

760
01:07:54,270 --> 01:07:56,602
But aren't you curious
about where the money went?

761
01:07:56,672 --> 01:07:59,641
Not really. Why, do you know?

762
01:08:00,509 --> 01:08:01,476
No.

763
01:08:01,610 --> 01:08:02,838
Well, then.

764
01:08:02,978 --> 01:08:04,673
I suppose if I get curious,
I can ask him myself.

765
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:06,941
God, no! Please!

766
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:12,144
You tell me to ask him,
and then you don't care!

767
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,720
I don't understand! What do you want!?

768
01:08:19,595 --> 01:08:23,463
What was that? What was that?

769
01:08:25,134 --> 01:08:28,194
A woman, who is actually concerned
about what I want?

770
01:08:39,115 --> 01:08:40,980
I may have to let you live yet.

771
01:08:41,917 --> 01:08:44,613
I'd be, killing off a rare,
endangered species.

772
01:09:03,472 --> 01:09:06,600
At least you woulda died like a man, right?

773
01:09:07,076 --> 01:09:11,274
I mean, you didn't resort to blubbering
and begging.

774
01:09:29,899 --> 01:09:31,526
So, what do you make of all this?

775
01:09:32,468 --> 01:09:33,526
I don't know.

776
01:09:34,436 --> 01:09:37,405
You think it's weird that he robbed a bank,
and has no money to show for it, huh?

777
01:09:37,640 --> 01:09:38,402
Yeah.

778
01:09:41,377 --> 01:09:42,969
Why do ya think that is?

779
01:09:45,014 --> 01:09:46,572
You never saw him in a bank.

780
01:09:47,850 --> 01:09:48,976
He has no money.

781
01:09:49,151 --> 01:09:51,642
There's nothing about a bank robbery
in the paper...

782
01:09:51,754 --> 01:09:54,279
You don't think he robbed a bank.

783
01:09:55,291 --> 01:09:57,623
You just put that together, just now?

784
01:10:03,098 --> 01:10:05,259
Well, at least you're finally
usin' your head.

785
01:10:07,703 --> 01:10:11,901
Yeah, I figure ol' Trip ain't smart
enough to pull a bank job.

786
01:10:12,074 --> 01:10:13,769
So then why did you want me
to talk to him?

787
01:10:13,876 --> 01:10:15,605
See, he's obviously up to something.

788
01:10:17,513 --> 01:10:20,914
That's why he grabbed you,
brought ya here,

789
01:10:25,688 --> 01:10:28,316
Question is why?

790
01:10:30,359 --> 01:10:31,155
I don't know.

791
01:10:31,393 --> 01:10:32,553
Of course you don't.

792
01:10:32,795 --> 01:10:34,126
It could be anything.

793
01:10:34,530 --> 01:10:38,523
I mean,
I can list hundreds of reasons why

794
01:10:38,767 --> 01:10:42,567
I personally have grabbed
some random girl off the street...

795
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:46,439
But, what if he didn't just grab
some "random" girl?

796
01:10:46,842 --> 01:10:50,243
Maybe the reason he's here,
doin' all this shit,

797
01:10:50,512 --> 01:10:53,140
has something to do... with... you.

798
01:10:53,382 --> 01:10:54,314
What are you talking about?

799
01:10:54,550 --> 01:10:54,982
You tell me.

800
01:10:55,217 --> 01:10:56,650
Why would someone wanna kidnap you?

801
01:10:56,885 --> 01:10:57,544
I have no idea.

802
01:10:57,786 --> 01:11:01,620
Really? No idea? No idea at all?

803
01:11:07,029 --> 01:11:08,496
You wanna tell me about that stolen car?

804
01:11:08,597 --> 01:11:10,565
I mean, "your sister's car."

805
01:11:14,737 --> 01:11:18,104
See, I hit on something, here.

806
01:11:18,340 --> 01:11:20,706
If he wanted the car back,
why didn't he just take it?

807
01:11:20,843 --> 01:11:23,107
This ain't about the car and you know it.

808
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:24,303
Why are you doing this?

809
01:11:29,151 --> 01:11:30,641
Because it's fun.

810
01:11:31,053 --> 01:11:32,748
So why did he pretend
to be a bank robber?

811
01:11:32,855 --> 01:11:34,322
Why does anyone lie?

812
01:11:34,556 --> 01:11:37,116
But let's not worry about him
for a second.

813
01:11:37,926 --> 01:11:40,190
I'm a lot more interested
in you right now.

814
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:45,657
You not gonna talk?

815
01:11:45,901 --> 01:11:47,027
then I'm done with you.

816
01:11:47,136 --> 01:11:48,103
You can't keep doing that!!

817
01:11:48,270 --> 01:11:49,396
Oh, no? Why'd you steal a car?

818
01:11:49,571 --> 01:11:50,299
'Cause I wanted one!

819
01:11:50,506 --> 01:11:51,768
Why not buy one, like other folks?

820
01:11:52,074 --> 01:11:52,631
I don't have a lot of money.

821
01:11:52,875 --> 01:11:55,366
No. That ain't it.

822
01:11:56,512 --> 01:12:00,448
It's not about money, or getting around.

823
01:12:00,683 --> 01:12:02,310
It's about the act.

824
01:12:02,785 --> 01:12:04,116
Of knowing you're better than them

825
01:12:04,353 --> 01:12:06,253
because you can do it
and get away with it.

826
01:12:07,022 --> 01:12:11,220
I respect that. I respect the hell out of that.

827
01:12:17,299 --> 01:12:19,631
Unless you're just lyin' to me again.

828
01:12:20,336 --> 01:12:21,826
How could I lie?

829
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,661
You're doing all the talking.

830
01:12:27,943 --> 01:12:29,467
Good point.

831
01:12:30,279 --> 01:12:35,717
Here, we got Trip, who wants everyone
to think he's the real thing,

832
01:12:35,951 --> 01:12:37,578
but he's just a faker.

833
01:12:37,953 --> 01:12:42,720
And you, who is the real fuckin' McCoy
if I ever met it,

834
01:12:42,958 --> 01:12:45,324
and you want everyone
to think you're not.

835
01:12:45,561 --> 01:12:47,153
The two extremes.

836
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,932
And in the middle is me:

837
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:01,836
perfectly comfortable with who I am
and what I am.

838
01:13:04,279 --> 01:13:09,307
It's like fate brought us together,
for me to teach the two of you...

839
01:13:09,551 --> 01:13:10,779
So what's Trip's deal?

840
01:13:11,019 --> 01:13:12,281
Well, why don't we bring him out
and ask him?

841
01:13:12,521 --> 01:13:13,783
Why? You shouldn't have to.

842
01:13:14,022 --> 01:13:16,252
I mean, you've gotten this far
on just your intuition.

843
01:13:16,492 --> 01:13:18,187
Why not finish it off?

844
01:13:19,495 --> 01:13:26,458
Way I figure it, Trip was hired
by somebody to bring you back.

845
01:13:28,837 --> 01:13:30,771
You ever get picked up
for boostin' cars?

846
01:13:31,039 --> 01:13:32,097
No shame in it.

847
01:13:32,641 --> 01:13:34,268
Happens to the best of us.

848
01:13:34,510 --> 01:13:39,004
So I figure,
what? You skip out on your bond.

849
01:13:39,181 --> 01:13:40,170
Am I close?

850
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:44,615
And Trip was sent to bring you back.

851
01:13:47,523 --> 01:13:52,324
Let's bring him out,
and see what I win for being right.

852
01:14:30,165 --> 01:14:31,860
You're not a complete retard,

853
01:14:32,134 --> 01:14:34,534
so I'm gonna assume
you were listening through the door.

854
01:14:35,370 --> 01:14:36,359
I was.

855
01:14:36,772 --> 01:14:40,299
Okay. Lay it on us.

856
01:14:42,177 --> 01:14:43,576
Can you undo me?

857
01:14:44,213 --> 01:14:46,306
I'm losing circulation to my foot.

858
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,451
You have a gun, what am I gonna do?

859
01:15:04,266 --> 01:15:06,734
Oh, fuck you. You're no fun anymore.

860
01:15:42,237 --> 01:15:45,365
Alright. So tell me: How close am I?

861
01:15:48,911 --> 01:15:49,900
You're pretty good.

862
01:15:50,145 --> 01:15:51,840
Yeah? Right on the money?

863
01:15:53,148 --> 01:15:54,342
You're close.

864
01:15:56,218 --> 01:15:57,742
What'd I miss?

865
01:16:00,222 --> 01:16:02,247
Well, you had me figured.

866
01:16:02,991 --> 01:16:04,356
Good work there.

867
01:16:05,527 --> 01:16:06,960
Sara, though...

868
01:16:07,596 --> 01:16:09,621
let's just say she's not as much
like you as you think.

869
01:16:09,765 --> 01:16:10,561
I don't know, dude.

870
01:16:10,666 --> 01:16:11,564
She sure had her way with you.

871
01:16:11,667 --> 01:16:12,998
She skipped out on her bond, yes.

872
01:16:13,101 --> 01:16:14,625
Do you wanna know the charges?

873
01:16:15,737 --> 01:16:21,266
Petty larceny. Prostitution.

874
01:16:24,413 --> 01:16:27,507
And conspiracy to commit murder.

875
01:16:28,550 --> 01:16:30,177
Murder? No shit!

876
01:16:31,119 --> 01:16:32,848
It's not as sexy as all that.

877
01:16:33,155 --> 01:16:38,286
She contracted a guy over the internet
to kill her daddy.

878
01:16:38,727 --> 01:16:40,354
Her rich daddy.

879
01:16:41,129 --> 01:16:42,994
That's why she did all of it.

880
01:16:43,198 --> 01:16:48,397
She's just some rich bitch trying to
get back at her daddy.

881
01:16:48,637 --> 01:16:51,105
He's the one who hired me
to bring her back.

882
01:16:53,809 --> 01:16:55,572
Rich girl rebellion?

883
01:16:57,346 --> 01:16:59,337
Where's the integrity in that?

884
01:17:00,215 --> 01:17:01,842
I thought you were the real thing, sweetie.

885
01:17:02,084 --> 01:17:03,244
Poor little rich girl.

886
01:17:03,485 --> 01:17:05,350
Poor little rich girl with two thumbs!

887
01:17:05,587 --> 01:17:07,248
I guess I was wrong.

888
01:17:08,223 --> 01:17:12,956
I thought you had it,
that killer instinct.

889
01:17:15,564 --> 01:17:18,294
I was hopin' maybe you
and me could start a new breed.

890
01:17:20,102 --> 01:17:22,502
But you're just like everybody else.

891
01:17:23,739 --> 01:17:26,207
Worse, you're a faker.

892
01:17:26,441 --> 01:17:28,875
I never told you I was all those things.

893
01:17:32,214 --> 01:17:35,547
You're right, you didn't.

894
01:17:39,488 --> 01:17:43,720
But you let me believe it,
and that's just as bad.

895
01:17:45,794 --> 01:17:46,624
What's she worth?

896
01:17:46,862 --> 01:17:47,226
Doesn't matter.

897
01:17:47,462 --> 01:17:48,554
Don't fuck with me, boy.

898
01:17:48,797 --> 01:17:49,388
I won't stop at your thumb.

899
01:17:49,631 --> 01:17:51,292
It was an exclusive contract.
They hired me.

900
01:17:51,466 --> 01:17:52,831
Even if you show up,
they won't pay you.

901
01:17:53,035 --> 01:17:56,027
Quit puttin' words in my mouth.
I jut asked what she was worth. A lot.

902
01:17:56,138 --> 01:17:57,298
Why did you pretend to be a bank robber?

903
01:17:57,372 --> 01:17:58,073
Shut up.

904
01:17:58,073 --> 01:18:00,166
No, answer her. I'd like to hear this.

905
01:18:02,444 --> 01:18:04,173
I thought that...

906
01:18:07,315 --> 01:18:10,409
If you knew I was here to bring you back,
you'd try to escape.

907
01:18:11,086 --> 01:18:12,781
And you probably would.

908
01:18:13,088 --> 01:18:16,057
This way, since you had nowhere to go,

909
01:18:16,224 --> 01:18:18,715
I thought,
you might just come along for the ride.

910
01:18:21,096 --> 01:18:22,188
It started to work, too.

911
01:18:22,297 --> 01:18:23,127
It did not!

912
01:18:23,298 --> 01:18:26,199
Oh, that kiss.
That was all a lie, too, I suppose?

913
01:18:27,102 --> 01:18:27,693
I can't take it.

914
01:18:27,836 --> 01:18:29,463
I'm gonna cut the girl loose, and...

915
01:18:29,705 --> 01:18:30,797
You forgot about our bet.

916
01:18:33,742 --> 01:18:35,141
Oh, yeah.

917
01:18:35,444 --> 01:18:38,072
If you can't pick the lock,

918
01:18:38,313 --> 01:18:39,678
you leave the girl here with me.

919
01:18:40,215 --> 01:18:42,080
How many tries do I get?

920
01:18:42,651 --> 01:18:43,948
Dose matter!

921
01:18:45,687 --> 01:18:47,279
You can have as many as you want.

922
01:18:47,522 --> 01:18:50,423
That doesn't seem very practical,
for time's sake.

923
01:18:50,659 --> 01:18:53,685
Okay, one try.

924
01:18:53,829 --> 01:18:54,693
- Fuck that!
- What?

925
01:18:54,830 --> 01:18:55,489
That's not fair.

926
01:18:55,630 --> 01:18:56,688
That's not nearly enough tries.

927
01:18:56,898 --> 01:18:59,799
Whooo! I think she's pickin' sides.

928
01:19:00,402 --> 01:19:02,802
Okay, three then.

929
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:04,169
Is that better?

930
01:19:04,406 --> 01:19:05,202
Three tries.

931
01:19:20,455 --> 01:19:21,251
There, got it!

932
01:19:21,490 --> 01:19:23,219
No wait, false alarm.

933
01:19:23,458 --> 01:19:24,482
That was one.

934
01:19:31,466 --> 01:19:32,125
Fuck!

935
01:19:32,601 --> 01:19:34,466
I can't do it! Fuck!

936
01:19:39,007 --> 01:19:40,531
You win, Trip. I can't do it.

937
01:19:40,642 --> 01:19:41,734
No. You've got one more chance!

938
01:19:42,010 --> 01:19:43,807
How many times you gotta beat your head
into a wall

939
01:19:43,912 --> 01:19:45,743
'fore you realize it don't feel good?
I can't do it!

940
01:19:45,847 --> 01:19:48,111
You get three tries. That was only two!

941
01:19:48,884 --> 01:19:50,215
Oh, god damn it, for Pete's sake!

942
01:19:53,421 --> 01:19:55,218
There, three.

943
01:20:02,831 --> 01:20:05,425
'Course, it doesn't seem like
Sara wants to go with you, Trip.

944
01:20:06,868 --> 01:20:08,335
I don't know why, myself.

945
01:20:08,570 --> 01:20:10,504
She's got a better chance with you,
it seems.

946
01:20:10,739 --> 01:20:13,799
I won, state fair and town square.

947
01:20:14,276 --> 01:20:18,007
Yes, technically, you did.

948
01:20:19,381 --> 01:20:21,144
But let's look at this for a moment.

949
01:20:21,383 --> 01:20:22,077
What's to look at?

950
01:20:22,317 --> 01:20:24,308
Why don't you shut up
and let the man talk.

951
01:20:24,553 --> 01:20:28,546
Thank you. Now, your way, Trip:

952
01:20:29,224 --> 01:20:33,160
I walk out that door,
leave you two here.

953
01:20:33,562 --> 01:20:38,329
You take her back,
or try to, but she escapes.

954
01:20:39,601 --> 01:20:41,762
Then you got nothing, for all your trouble,

955
01:20:42,337 --> 01:20:48,936
'cept a missing thumb. And, me,
I got nobody to talk to.

956
01:20:50,412 --> 01:20:52,380
I gotta grab somebody else,
and, well, frankly,

957
01:20:52,447 --> 01:20:56,076
I don't know if I'm gonna like somebody
else as much as Sara.

958
01:20:59,020 --> 01:21:02,786
Nobody wins, except, Sara, I guess.

959
01:21:03,024 --> 01:21:06,460
But does she really? She's got no car.

960
01:21:06,695 --> 01:21:09,823
And no money, and a hole in her arm.

961
01:21:10,131 --> 01:21:11,120
What are you thinking?

962
01:21:12,634 --> 01:21:14,101
Why don't you tell me.

963
01:21:14,269 --> 01:21:14,826
I don't know.

964
01:21:15,036 --> 01:21:15,832
Don't try to read my mind.

965
01:21:16,037 --> 01:21:19,029
Just use yours, and see if you can find
a way everyone can win.

966
01:21:19,140 --> 01:21:20,038
This is bullshit.

967
01:21:20,208 --> 01:21:21,877
I won! A deal is a deal!

968
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:25,040
Be quiet. Let the girl think.

969
01:21:26,348 --> 01:21:28,908
If I go with him,
he's just gonna try and turn me in.

970
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:29,539
Yep.

971
01:21:29,651 --> 01:21:31,983
Which is bad, unless I can escape.

972
01:21:32,153 --> 01:21:32,642
Which you can.

973
01:21:32,888 --> 01:21:33,684
Except, when I escape,

974
01:21:33,922 --> 01:21:37,221
I know it's only a matter of time
before he comes after me again.

975
01:21:37,459 --> 01:21:39,120
Him, or someone like him.

976
01:21:39,327 --> 01:21:42,023
I think I just said all that,
but keep going.

977
01:21:44,633 --> 01:21:47,295
If I go with you...
there are no guarantees.

978
01:21:47,535 --> 01:21:50,504
Right. I'll probably just kill you,

979
01:21:50,772 --> 01:21:52,467
or sell you to some pimp in Tijuana.

980
01:21:52,707 --> 01:21:54,538
This really sucks!

981
01:21:59,080 --> 01:22:01,275
We'll get to you in a minute.

982
01:22:01,516 --> 01:22:03,541
I don't... I don't see how I can win.

983
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:04,877
Hmm. Guess you're right.

984
01:22:06,221 --> 01:22:07,688
Come with me and don't escape.

985
01:22:08,023 --> 01:22:09,149
What was that?

986
01:22:09,457 --> 01:22:10,549
Why not come with me willingly.

987
01:22:10,792 --> 01:22:12,225
So you can turn me in!?

988
01:22:12,460 --> 01:22:13,427
I got an idea:

989
01:22:13,662 --> 01:22:17,098
hows about he lets me outta these handcuffs
and I kick your ass!

990
01:22:17,299 --> 01:22:19,164
Stumpy motherfucker!

991
01:22:19,734 --> 01:22:21,224
You come with me, voluntarily:

992
01:22:21,937 --> 01:22:23,928
I won't pull anything,
you don't pull anything.

993
01:22:24,005 --> 01:22:24,471
I turn you in...

994
01:22:24,539 --> 01:22:25,096
No way!

995
01:22:25,173 --> 01:22:26,140
Listen!

996
01:22:26,207 --> 01:22:29,802
I turn you in, collect the money,
and split it with you: fifty-fifty.

997
01:22:30,145 --> 01:22:35,708
Then, if you wanna run away again,
you have some money to run on.

998
01:22:35,817 --> 01:22:36,476
What's the catch?

999
01:22:36,584 --> 01:22:41,021
No catch. I get to turn you in,
and collect half the money.

1000
01:22:41,189 --> 01:22:43,384
I don't care what happens after that.

1001
01:22:48,496 --> 01:22:49,394
Okay.

1002
01:22:49,497 --> 01:22:50,231
Well, that's great for you two.

1003
01:22:50,231 --> 01:22:50,959
But what about me?

1004
01:22:51,066 --> 01:22:52,192
What about you??

1005
01:22:52,267 --> 01:22:52,756
hit the road.

1006
01:22:52,867 --> 01:22:54,266
I already beat you.

1007
01:22:54,402 --> 01:22:55,130
Yeah, I'll beat you alright.

1008
01:22:55,270 --> 01:22:57,830
Let's see you collect your money
with two bloody stumps, and no head.

1009
01:22:57,906 --> 01:22:58,406
He's right.

1010
01:22:58,406 --> 01:23:00,670
He could kill both of us if he wanted.

1011
01:23:00,775 --> 01:23:02,868
But he doesn't get shit if he does that.

1012
01:23:03,311 --> 01:23:04,141
He needs us.

1013
01:23:04,312 --> 01:23:06,780
We could give a fuck about him,
but he needs us.

1014
01:23:07,015 --> 01:23:07,982
You know, I'm right here.

1015
01:23:08,149 --> 01:23:09,912
You don't have to talk about me like
I'm the fucking Pope.

1016
01:23:10,018 --> 01:23:11,645
What about a three-way?

1017
01:23:13,922 --> 01:23:16,152
You never, never cease to amaze me.

1018
01:23:16,624 --> 01:23:17,921
She's talking about a three way
cut of the money.

1019
01:23:18,026 --> 01:23:20,085
Yeah. That way everyone wins.

1020
01:23:20,261 --> 01:23:21,888
Just exactly how much are we talking about?

1021
01:23:22,130 --> 01:23:25,998
Yeah, how much am I worth?

1022
01:23:26,201 --> 01:23:26,496
A lot.

1023
01:23:26,735 --> 01:23:29,295
You better say a number, boy,
or the deal's off,

1024
01:23:29,537 --> 01:23:31,698
and the maid in this joint is gonna wish
she'd stayed in bed tomorrow.

1025
01:23:31,940 --> 01:23:33,032
I haven't agreed to this yet, anyway.

1026
01:23:33,141 --> 01:23:34,233
So it... You're just the middle man.

1027
01:23:34,342 --> 01:23:36,173
I don't feel like sharin' even stevens...

1028
01:23:36,311 --> 01:23:36,777
This is my deal!

1029
01:23:36,845 --> 01:23:37,743
You're not even a part of this!

1030
01:23:37,812 --> 01:23:39,643
How much is your life worth to you, Trip?

1031
01:23:39,714 --> 01:23:41,545
Is it worth your half of the pot?

1032
01:23:41,649 --> 01:23:43,344
If you kill him then nobody
get's anything!

1033
01:23:43,485 --> 01:23:44,918
Right. You're right.

1034
01:23:45,053 --> 01:23:47,021
I pull this trigger,
and I don't see any of that money.

1035
01:23:47,155 --> 01:23:48,053
But so what?

1036
01:23:48,156 --> 01:23:50,852
I'm no worse off than I was
before I walked through that door.

1037
01:23:51,159 --> 01:23:52,217
Trip, on the other hand...

1038
01:23:52,460 --> 01:23:58,888
Fuck! You are right! You win!!

1039
01:24:00,835 --> 01:24:04,134
Sara - you got any problem with that?

1040
01:24:04,406 --> 01:24:06,431
I wanna know how much.

1041
01:24:07,008 --> 01:24:07,872
Fair enough.

1042
01:24:08,009 --> 01:24:09,306
I mean, it wouldn't be the first time

1043
01:24:09,477 --> 01:24:12,207
he completely shit-face lied about
having money.

1044
01:24:12,380 --> 01:24:13,472
I never said I had any money.

1045
01:24:13,715 --> 01:24:18,618
But you let me believe it,
and that's just as bad.

1046
01:24:20,622 --> 01:24:22,351
You're both a coupla liars.

1047
01:24:22,590 --> 01:24:24,148
I think we established that.

1048
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:28,089
But the girl's got a point:
how much are we talkin'

1049
01:24:31,399 --> 01:24:33,162
Five hundred thousand dollars.

1050
01:24:33,568 --> 01:24:34,728
Holy Shit.

1051
01:24:35,470 --> 01:24:37,700
I can see why you were
so reluctant to let it go.

1052
01:24:37,939 --> 01:24:38,997
Five hundred thousand...

1053
01:24:39,174 --> 01:24:41,108
Yep.
From the man you tried to have killed.

1054
01:24:41,342 --> 01:24:43,242
He just bought you a new life.

1055
01:24:45,380 --> 01:24:48,315
How do I know one of you guys isn't
gonna try and screw me out of my cut.

1056
01:24:48,550 --> 01:24:50,677
How do I know you're not gonna split
before we collect?

1057
01:24:50,919 --> 01:24:54,252
It's, uh... how did Trip put it earlier?

1058
01:24:56,491 --> 01:24:58,391
"Honour among thieves?"

1059
01:24:59,427 --> 01:25:01,952
As hard as it may be,
we're gonna have to trust each other.

1060
01:25:03,264 --> 01:25:04,959
I still don't see what
I get out of all this.

1061
01:25:05,166 --> 01:25:07,964
You get to live, you crybaby-bitch.

1062
01:25:09,003 --> 01:25:15,636
Now suck it up!
Everyone in agreement, then?

1063
01:25:18,012 --> 01:25:19,377
Let's shake on it.

1064
01:25:30,558 --> 01:25:32,389
You think it's funny, to belittle me!?

1065
01:25:32,627 --> 01:25:33,594
That you can just say
whatever the fuck you want,

1066
01:25:33,728 --> 01:25:34,786
and I JUST HAVE TO TAKE IT!?

1067
01:25:34,996 --> 01:25:35,963
Put down the gun!

1068
01:25:36,197 --> 01:25:37,289
No. I'm not gonna to put down the gun.

1069
01:25:37,499 --> 01:25:38,466
Fuck you, put it down!

1070
01:25:38,633 --> 01:25:39,691
No, goddamn it, no!

1071
01:25:39,934 --> 01:25:41,993
These aren't the actions of
a"team player," Trip.

1072
01:25:42,237 --> 01:25:43,829
I'll fuckin' give you gills, man!

1073
01:25:44,005 --> 01:25:45,597
Trip, let him go!

1074
01:25:45,707 --> 01:25:47,004
Boy, you're deep into character,
huh, buddy?

1075
01:25:47,175 --> 01:25:50,303
You're gonna do what I tell you!

1076
01:25:51,846 --> 01:25:53,211
I'm gonna count to three,

1077
01:25:53,448 --> 01:25:55,746
and then I'm going to put a hole
in the girl,

1078
01:25:57,051 --> 01:25:58,109
and then you've got nothing.

1079
01:25:58,319 --> 01:26:00,287
No, please!! Trip!!

1080
01:26:00,455 --> 01:26:02,013
You kill her, I kill you!

1081
01:26:02,223 --> 01:26:05,852
I could shoot the both o' ya before you
could even find the pointy end of that thing.

1082
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,290
I am sick and tired of you
talking down to me!

1083
01:26:08,530 --> 01:26:11,328
You fucking show me respect!!

1084
01:26:11,399 --> 01:26:12,331
One...

1085
01:26:13,201 --> 01:26:14,759
Show me respect!!!

1086
01:26:15,003 --> 01:26:16,129
Damn it, Trip!

1087
01:26:16,371 --> 01:26:17,599
Two...

1088
01:26:17,872 --> 01:26:18,600
God damn it!

1089
01:26:18,840 --> 01:26:20,774
No! Don't!

1090
01:26:21,142 --> 01:26:22,074
Three!

1091
01:26:43,431 --> 01:26:44,728
Look at that.

1092
01:26:45,400 --> 01:26:48,233
Seems Trip doesn't know how to work
and play well with others.

1093
01:26:50,405 --> 01:26:51,463
Stay put.

1094
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:58,510
Oooh, that's ugly, ain't it?

1095
01:27:00,515 --> 01:27:02,506
I didn't want it to end like this.

1096
01:27:04,285 --> 01:27:06,810
Nothing worse than stabbing somebody
by accident.

1097
01:27:07,855 --> 01:27:09,789
It's like cumming in your pants.

1098
01:27:12,427 --> 01:27:14,156
Unless you don't believe in accidents.

1099
01:27:14,395 --> 01:27:18,058
Do you, Sara? Or do you believe in fate?

1100
01:27:19,100 --> 01:27:20,863
Was this destined to be?

1101
01:27:27,008 --> 01:27:36,440
I don't have those answers,
but I do know this.

1102
01:27:42,657 --> 01:27:46,286
Never take the word of a liar...

1103
01:28:00,742 --> 01:28:02,471
They coulda been picked any time.

1104
01:28:18,593 --> 01:28:20,083
Ain't that a pisser?

1105
01:29:17,085 --> 01:29:18,643
You want some, too?

1106
01:29:18,986 --> 01:29:21,614
Did that make you feel like a man?

1107
01:29:21,856 --> 01:29:23,153
Getting' all up in my shit.

1108
01:29:23,391 --> 01:29:25,552
Raisin' your voice, threatening me.

1109
01:29:25,860 --> 01:29:27,452
You feel tough, huh?

1110
01:29:27,995 --> 01:29:29,519
For the first time in your life,

1111
01:29:29,764 --> 01:29:33,222
you felt like your cock was
for more than peein' I bet, huh?

1112
01:29:34,402 --> 01:29:37,098
You think you coulda done it? Cut me?

1113
01:29:38,005 --> 01:29:40,974
I got news for you: You're still a bitch.

1114
01:29:41,175 --> 01:29:42,164
Open up.

1115
01:29:44,112 --> 01:29:47,980
Believe me, I didn't want it
to go down like this, man.

1116
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,081
I coulda used the money.

1117
01:29:50,284 --> 01:29:54,414
But I'm not gonna sit here and
start cryin' over some dead slut.

1118
01:29:55,022 --> 01:29:57,650
The way I look at it,
I just saved the poor asshole

1119
01:29:57,892 --> 01:29:59,689
who woulda wound up marryin' that girl

1120
01:29:59,927 --> 01:30:03,693
a lifetime of lies and agony,
and a broken heart.

1121
01:30:04,031 --> 01:30:07,523
And that... that is worth any bounty.

1122
01:30:07,769 --> 01:30:12,763
Ah, ah! Don't make me blow the back of
your neck off.

1123
01:30:14,742 --> 01:30:17,768
Or were you just gonna tell me
it's not loaded again?

1124
01:30:18,479 --> 01:30:23,883
Awww. Poor bastard.

1125
01:30:24,752 --> 01:30:26,549
You really fell for her, didn't you?

1126
01:30:26,788 --> 01:30:29,086
What were you sayin' about a kiss?

1127
01:30:30,358 --> 01:30:33,259
Oh, that's nice. That's so nice.

1128
01:30:33,494 --> 01:30:36,292
She tried to fuck me, but she kissed you.

1129
01:30:36,531 --> 01:30:37,964
That's nice.

1130
01:30:39,967 --> 01:30:43,801
It's not too late, ya know.

1131
01:30:44,238 --> 01:30:46,502
We could still prop up her body
and have a little fun with her.

1132
01:30:46,741 --> 01:30:47,241
YOU'RE SICK.

1133
01:30:47,241 --> 01:30:49,709
You figure that out all just now?

1134
01:30:49,944 --> 01:30:51,707
I didn't hear anything, Trip.

1135
01:30:51,946 --> 01:30:54,176
You calling me sick?

1136
01:30:54,515 --> 01:30:55,573
No time to get shy now.

1137
01:30:55,817 --> 01:30:57,751
Not when I got another couple of
inches of this thing

1138
01:30:57,819 --> 01:30:59,184
I can stuff down your throat.

1139
01:30:59,320 --> 01:31:01,720
Does that mean you want him
to suck your cock, too?

1140
01:31:23,144 --> 01:31:23,633
What?

1141
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:24,267
Stay where you are.

1142
01:31:24,378 --> 01:31:26,005
Why? I just saved your life!

1143
01:31:26,147 --> 01:31:27,205
You saved shit.

1144
01:31:27,415 --> 01:31:31,044
Wha... he tried to kill me,
and he was gonna kill you!

1145
01:31:31,152 --> 01:31:35,418
There's only one murderer
in this room: You!

1146
01:31:35,523 --> 01:31:37,718
Oh, my god! Are you insane!?

1147
01:31:37,792 --> 01:31:40,124
Maybe. Maybe that's what happens

1148
01:31:40,394 --> 01:31:44,330
when you CUT SOMEBODY'S THUMB OFF...
and STAB HIS BROTHER TO DEATH!

1149
01:31:44,465 --> 01:31:45,432
Your brother?

1150
01:31:46,701 --> 01:31:48,430
AaaaaAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAGGGHHHHH!!!
You asshole!!

1151
01:31:51,472 --> 01:31:52,962
Geddaway from me!!

1152
01:31:53,174 --> 01:31:53,697
Let me look...

1153
01:31:53,774 --> 01:31:54,763
Fucking do not touch meee!

1154
01:31:54,842 --> 01:31:56,867
Yousonuvabitch!! Don't touch meee!

1155
01:31:57,178 --> 01:31:58,202
Me?

1156
01:31:59,180 --> 01:32:00,545
We had it planned...

1157
01:32:02,316 --> 01:32:03,442
Don't you ever die?

1158
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:04,846
So this was all... a game?

1159
01:32:05,086 --> 01:32:06,383
No game.

1160
01:32:06,754 --> 01:32:09,222
I don't play around with $500,000.

1161
01:32:09,457 --> 01:32:11,220
I don't under... understand!

1162
01:32:11,459 --> 01:32:12,357
Good cop, bad cop...

1163
01:32:12,593 --> 01:32:13,423
What!?

1164
01:32:13,661 --> 01:32:17,153
We bring you here, confuse you,
spook you a little.

1165
01:32:17,398 --> 01:32:20,094
You pick the lesser of two evils,

1166
01:32:20,334 --> 01:32:22,996
that guy turns you in,
and we split the paycheck.

1167
01:32:23,170 --> 01:32:25,001
You guys are fucking psycho!

1168
01:32:25,172 --> 01:32:27,868
Now, you wanna start
with the name-calling, too?

1169
01:32:28,142 --> 01:32:30,110
For god's sake, call an ambulance!

1170
01:32:32,580 --> 01:32:34,480
If I get her to a hospital,
I can still collect...

1171
01:32:34,649 --> 01:32:36,514
Not for her. For me!

1172
01:32:36,918 --> 01:32:41,582
I hate to break this to you,
but you're pretty fucked up.

1173
01:32:41,756 --> 01:32:44,020
I don't think there'll be much
they can do for you.

1174
01:32:44,725 --> 01:32:45,692
Her, on the other hand...

1175
01:32:45,760 --> 01:32:47,318
Fuck that bitch!

1176
01:32:49,030 --> 01:32:50,190
Hold on a sec.

1177
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:51,591
Why? Why go through all this?

1178
01:32:51,766 --> 01:32:52,357
I don't understand.

1179
01:32:52,533 --> 01:32:54,899
There's lots of shit I don't understand.

1180
01:32:55,169 --> 01:32:57,296
That doesn't stop it from happening.

1181
01:32:57,538 --> 01:32:58,300
Kill her!

1182
01:32:58,539 --> 01:33:00,302
Are you out of your mind!?

1183
01:33:00,841 --> 01:33:02,308
This isn't a girl anymore!

1184
01:33:02,743 --> 01:33:04,870
This is a bloody heap of money!

1185
01:33:06,314 --> 01:33:07,679
That bitch killed me!!

1186
01:33:07,915 --> 01:33:11,715
Yeah, and I shot her for it.

1187
01:33:12,019 --> 01:33:15,079
I must've been out of my mind,
shooting her.

1188
01:33:15,323 --> 01:33:19,885
It's an incredible stroke of good luck
that she's not dead.

1189
01:33:22,863 --> 01:33:26,299
She can be patched up.

1190
01:33:28,536 --> 01:33:31,038
I'm your fucking brother! Kill her!!!

1191
01:33:31,038 --> 01:33:34,098
You shut up! You shut up!

1192
01:33:34,308 --> 01:33:36,299
You don't get to boss me anymore!

1193
01:33:43,150 --> 01:33:47,382
Do you have any dying wishes for how
I should spend your half of the money?

1194
01:33:48,522 --> 01:33:50,649
We had it all planned.

1195
01:33:52,393 --> 01:33:54,088
Don't let me die... Please!?

1196
01:33:54,195 --> 01:33:59,428
Sh-sh-sh. There, now. Just hush up.

1197
01:34:04,538 --> 01:34:06,802
God damn it, don't let me die.

1198
01:34:07,108 --> 01:34:08,666
CALL AN AMBULANCE!

1199
01:34:08,909 --> 01:34:11,469
I'm not calling a fucking ambulance.

1200
01:34:11,712 --> 01:34:13,543
Not here. And explain all of this.

1201
01:34:13,781 --> 01:34:15,078
I'm not going to jail.

1202
01:34:15,282 --> 01:34:18,217
Somebody had to have heard the gunshots,
and the screaming.

1203
01:34:18,853 --> 01:34:21,378
Help is probably already on its way.

1204
01:34:22,323 --> 01:34:25,986
No. No it's not.

1205
01:34:27,128 --> 01:34:29,995
We bought up this entire row of rooms
for the night.

1206
01:34:30,197 --> 01:34:32,825
And last night, and tomorrow.

1207
01:34:33,134 --> 01:34:36,831
I slept in that one last night.

1208
01:34:37,138 --> 01:34:43,008
And Dennis was waiting in that one
all day until we got here.

1209
01:34:43,244 --> 01:34:45,178
Man, you guys thought of everything.

1210
01:34:45,579 --> 01:34:48,571
So none of it was real?

1211
01:34:48,816 --> 01:34:50,181
Except the money.

1212
01:34:50,818 --> 01:34:53,252
And your thumb, you cripple.

1213
01:34:53,587 --> 01:34:57,353
Pleeeeeeeaaasssee... man...

1214
01:34:58,059 --> 01:34:59,959
And the number I did on your brother.

1215
01:35:05,232 --> 01:35:06,927
I will be dieing!

1216
01:35:07,368 --> 01:35:12,203
Shut up! Who's the fucking crybaby now!?

1217
01:35:17,111 --> 01:35:20,672
Sara, you don't wanna die, do you?

1218
01:35:23,017 --> 01:35:26,680
Okay. Here goes: One...

1219
01:35:27,488 --> 01:35:29,353
...l'm going to take you to a hospital.

1220
01:35:30,024 --> 01:35:33,084
You're going to say we were attacked
in an alley,

1221
01:35:33,327 --> 01:35:36,194
and you're going to stick to that story.

1222
01:35:37,031 --> 01:35:41,866
Two, I'm going to call your father
and have him meet us.

1223
01:35:43,237 --> 01:35:54,239
Three, he's going to arrive, and pay me,
and that's it.

1224
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:58,848
By the time the hospital alerts the
authorities to your identity, I'm gone.

1225
01:35:59,453 --> 01:36:01,819
I don't give a fuck
what happens after that.

1226
01:36:02,089 --> 01:36:04,114
I just want my money.

1227
01:36:05,259 --> 01:36:09,218
Oh, god!!!

1228
01:36:18,706 --> 01:36:22,972
Or I can leave you here to die.

1229
01:36:23,477 --> 01:36:26,969
Your choice. You got some holes in ya.

1230
01:36:28,015 --> 01:36:29,812
It doesn't look good.

1231
01:36:40,494 --> 01:36:42,621
See that. Sara.

1232
01:36:43,130 --> 01:36:44,097
Is that what you want?

1233
01:37:12,426 --> 01:37:17,227
If you wanna kill someone, here's a hint:

1234
01:37:17,865 --> 01:37:21,961
you gotta shoot 'em somewhere a little
more vital than the arm, okay?

1235
01:37:22,636 --> 01:37:24,069
That's twice.

1236
01:37:24,271 --> 01:37:25,067
What about your gut?

1237
01:37:25,239 --> 01:37:26,604
You're hit pretty bad.

1238
01:37:29,543 --> 01:37:32,273
You hit a scar, princess.

1239
01:37:33,280 --> 01:37:34,975
I got tons of 'em.

1240
01:37:36,851 --> 01:37:39,411
I won't even notice one more.

1241
01:37:41,021 --> 01:37:44,787
Now when I did your brother over there,

1242
01:37:47,261 --> 01:37:52,255
I was sure to aim for his lungs,
his kidneys.

1243
01:37:54,668 --> 01:38:00,163
His large intestine, boy that's a bleeder.

1244
01:38:01,976 --> 01:38:02,840
What are you?

1245
01:38:04,979 --> 01:38:06,310
A survivor.

1246
01:38:09,683 --> 01:38:15,485
You had no idea
what you got yourself into.

1247
01:38:16,624 --> 01:38:18,854
You didn't stand a chance.

1248
01:38:29,837 --> 01:38:31,862
Open your eyes.

1249
01:38:33,674 --> 01:38:37,633
It's okay to be fascinated by me.

1250
01:38:38,479 --> 01:38:47,649
They always are. Look at me. Come on.

1251
01:38:50,658 --> 01:38:56,392
OPEN YOUR EYES!

1252
01:38:59,934 --> 01:39:01,663
Take a good look.

1253
01:39:03,504 --> 01:39:16,007
One long,
last good look.

1254
01:39:21,655 --> 01:39:23,145
And you know...

1255
01:39:24,758 --> 01:39:30,321
For about a second,
I actually did like you...

1256
01:42:30,322 --> 01:42:31,322
