1
00:02:01,521 --> 00:02:03,153
Okay, My turn.

2
00:02:03,155 --> 00:02:04,839
Ready?

3
00:02:06,192 --> 00:02:08,225
One two three.

4
00:02:12,732 --> 00:02:15,482
- What are you dicks laughing at?
- Nothing.

5
00:02:15,484 --> 00:02:17,301
- You making fun of me?
- No, Alan.

6
00:02:17,303 --> 00:02:19,303
We were just lighting farts.

7
00:02:19,305 --> 00:02:21,338
Yeah?
Let me see.

8
00:02:21,340 --> 00:02:24,508
Whoa, that's great.

9
00:02:24,510 --> 00:02:26,393
- Let me try.
- It's not my lighter.

10
00:02:26,395 --> 00:02:29,129
Like I care. Get out of here.

11
00:02:29,131 --> 00:02:30,664
You better not break my lighter, Alan.

12
00:02:30,666 --> 00:02:33,084
Oh yeah? What are you gonna do?

13
00:02:33,086 --> 00:02:35,385
Piss on me like you do to your bed every night?

14
00:02:35,387 --> 00:02:37,104
Shut up.

15
00:02:37,106 --> 00:02:38,906
No, you shut up!

16
00:02:38,908 --> 00:02:42,226
And if you say one more word tonight, I'm gonna punch you.

17
00:02:42,228 --> 00:02:43,627
Now watch this.

18
00:02:46,732 --> 00:02:49,082
How was that, huh? Was it big?

19
00:02:49,084 --> 00:02:50,734
I'm not sleeping in that bed anymore.

20
00:02:50,736 --> 00:02:52,186
What's so funny?

21
00:02:52,188 --> 00:02:54,689
Talk about your hershey squirts.

22
00:02:54,691 --> 00:02:56,657
Yeah?

23
00:02:57,844 --> 00:03:00,027
How funny is this?

24
00:03:01,481 --> 00:03:02,746
Put it out!
Put it out!

25
00:03:02,748 --> 00:03:04,115
Put it out!
Put it out!

26
00:03:04,117 --> 00:03:05,866
Now that's a flame.

27
00:03:05,868 --> 00:03:07,852
Put it out!
Put it out!

28
00:03:07,854 --> 00:03:10,388
Are you out of your fucking mind?

29
00:03:10,390 --> 00:03:12,206
Let go!

30
00:03:12,208 --> 00:03:15,126
Really, Alan, are you that stupid?

31
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:17,811
Not as stupid as you, you big penis.

32
00:03:17,813 --> 00:03:19,380
Is that so, fat boy?

33
00:03:20,850 --> 00:03:22,649
Hey, Randy.

34
00:03:22,651 --> 00:03:24,568
You ass stinks.

35
00:03:24,570 --> 00:03:26,270
Alan, get back here now.

36
00:03:28,024 --> 00:03:30,557
I'm gonna teach that little prick a lesson, he won't forget.

37
00:03:30,559 --> 00:03:33,694
Yeah right. He always gets away with everything.

38
00:03:33,696 --> 00:03:35,997
No, he'll get his, boys.

39
00:03:35,999 --> 00:03:38,065
He'll get his.

40
00:04:00,189 --> 00:04:02,223
Chew your food.

41
00:04:03,409 --> 00:04:05,642
I chew my food. Why you got to treat me like a baby?

42
00:04:05,644 --> 00:04:08,612
I'm not treating you like a baby. Chew the food.

43
00:04:08,614 --> 00:04:11,399
Randy, tell Alan to stop it.

44
00:04:11,401 --> 00:04:13,851
- Knock it off, idiot.
- He started it.

45
00:04:13,853 --> 00:04:15,535
Did not.

46
00:04:17,607 --> 00:04:19,356
You know, Alan...

47
00:04:19,358 --> 00:04:22,610
...if you weren't such a wanker...

48
00:04:22,612 --> 00:04:24,528
...then maybe your brother wouldn't be moving in on your girlfriend.

49
00:04:24,530 --> 00:04:26,313
What are you talking about?

50
00:04:26,315 --> 00:04:28,181
Check it out.

51
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:34,539
That was funny.

52
00:04:34,541 --> 00:04:36,891
He's just talking.

53
00:04:36,893 --> 00:04:39,093
Oh yeah, he's talking to her alright.

54
00:04:39,095 --> 00:04:41,345
Be quiet already.

55
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:43,113
He's touchy, isn't he, boys?

56
00:04:48,071 --> 00:04:51,389
Alright, everybody, listen up.

57
00:04:51,391 --> 00:04:54,708
Quiet down. Excuse me.

58
00:04:56,896 --> 00:04:59,229
Excuse me.

59
00:04:59,231 --> 00:05:00,898
Let me handle this, Frank.

60
00:05:02,902 --> 00:05:05,235
Hey, shut it!

61
00:05:05,237 --> 00:05:07,421
Thank you, doll.

62
00:05:08,508 --> 00:05:10,925
Today we are very fortunate to have with us..

63
00:05:10,927 --> 00:05:14,395
..one of our local policemen to talk to us firsthand

64
00:05:14,397 --> 00:05:16,347
About the dangers of smoking.

65
00:05:16,349 --> 00:05:19,249
Douchebag.

66
00:05:19,251 --> 00:05:21,085
Asswipe.

67
00:05:21,087 --> 00:05:23,087
Now that's enough.

68
00:05:23,089 --> 00:05:25,022
Try not to act like animals for a minute.

69
00:05:25,024 --> 00:05:26,574
You think you guys can do that?

70
00:05:26,576 --> 00:05:28,409
Eat me.

71
00:05:28,411 --> 00:05:30,377
Mr. Spassky?

72
00:05:30,379 --> 00:05:33,180
How'd you like to clean those tables all by yourself today?

73
00:05:33,182 --> 00:05:35,266
- No, sir.
- Then shut up!

74
00:05:35,268 --> 00:05:39,020
You're such a fucking spaz.

75
00:05:39,022 --> 00:05:41,271
You kids have no respect for anything.

76
00:05:41,273 --> 00:05:42,940
It's alright, Frank.

77
00:05:42,942 --> 00:05:45,809
I'll take it from here. Don't worry, kids.

78
00:05:45,811 --> 00:05:48,679
I'll be brief so you can get back to this delicious food.

79
00:05:48,681 --> 00:05:51,898
Hey, why are you talking like that?

80
00:05:51,900 --> 00:05:53,434
I'm glad you asked.

81
00:05:53,436 --> 00:05:57,705
After 35 years of smoking I lost my larynx to cancer.

82
00:05:57,707 --> 00:05:59,339
Hey, dude.

83
00:05:59,341 --> 00:06:02,860
Can you play "intergalactic" on that thing?

84
00:06:02,862 --> 00:06:05,396
Maybe later.

85
00:06:06,699 --> 00:06:09,600
The force, luke. You must use the force.

86
00:06:10,887 --> 00:06:13,037
Spinelli, give me that thing right now.

87
00:06:14,173 --> 00:06:15,772
- Hot potato.
- Trace.

88
00:06:17,393 --> 00:06:20,277
- What thing?
- It's no big deal.

89
00:06:20,279 --> 00:06:21,745
You know what? Forget it.

90
00:06:21,747 --> 00:06:24,714
These kids appreciate nothing.

91
00:06:37,930 --> 00:06:40,313
This stuff sucks. I want something else to eat.

92
00:06:40,315 --> 00:06:41,715
Too bad.

93
00:06:41,717 --> 00:06:43,617
I can't eat this junk. I'll throw up.

94
00:06:46,856 --> 00:06:48,522
Then you'll throw up.

95
00:06:48,524 --> 00:06:50,991
Now eat the chicken before i shove it down your throat.

96
00:06:50,993 --> 00:06:52,977
No, you eat it.

97
00:07:01,554 --> 00:07:03,087
Eat the fucking chicken, Alan.

98
00:07:03,089 --> 00:07:04,472
- Leave me alone.
- Eat it!

99
00:07:04,474 --> 00:07:06,373
No!

100
00:07:07,443 --> 00:07:09,610
Alright, that's it.

101
00:07:09,612 --> 00:07:12,029
- Clean it up.
- No, you.

102
00:07:12,031 --> 00:07:14,898
- I said clean it up.
- Let go of me.

103
00:07:14,900 --> 00:07:16,800
- Clean it up now.
- Let me go.

104
00:07:19,439 --> 00:07:21,472
I see you two are at it again.

105
00:07:21,474 --> 00:07:23,441
He's throwing food at the other kids

106
00:07:23,443 --> 00:07:25,109
And then he threw his plate on the floor.

107
00:07:25,111 --> 00:07:26,743
He's hitting me for no reason.

108
00:07:26,745 --> 00:07:28,112
- Stop lying, Alan.
- You're the liar.

109
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,513
Alright, calm down.

110
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:32,316
Alan, why don't you just come with me, alright?

111
00:07:32,318 --> 00:07:34,351
You're such a pussy, Alan.

112
00:07:34,353 --> 00:07:35,719
Hey, Randy.

113
00:07:35,721 --> 00:07:38,205
Your ass stinks.

114
00:07:42,528 --> 00:07:43,894
Alan, I thought we agreed

115
00:07:43,896 --> 00:07:46,130
You were gonna work extra hard to behave yourself.

116
00:07:46,132 --> 00:07:47,798
I'm trying, Ronnie.

117
00:07:47,800 --> 00:07:49,867
But everybody keeps picking on me 'cause I'm different.

118
00:07:49,869 --> 00:07:51,768
No one thinks you're different, Alan.

119
00:07:51,770 --> 00:07:54,171
Why don't you just start trying to be a little more cooperative, okay?

120
00:07:54,173 --> 00:07:56,040
Okay.

121
00:07:56,042 --> 00:07:58,909
Hey, do you think i could go to the kitchen and get something else to eat?

122
00:07:58,911 --> 00:08:01,511
Sure you can. But just remember what we talked about, okay?

123
00:08:01,513 --> 00:08:04,548
- Okay, I promise.
- I'll talk to you later.

124
00:08:08,804 --> 00:08:11,021
Quit it, Alan. You retard.

125
00:08:13,393 --> 00:08:15,375
Good shot, Bella.

126
00:08:15,377 --> 00:08:18,262
- Did you see that?
- Leave it alone, Petey.

127
00:08:18,264 --> 00:08:19,629
What'd you do that for?

128
00:08:19,631 --> 00:08:22,499
'Cause your face look like my ass. Problem?

129
00:08:23,969 --> 00:08:25,786
I hate you, Bella.

130
00:08:25,788 --> 00:08:28,471
Oh, you're breaking my heart.

131
00:08:28,473 --> 00:08:30,107
Eat this, you fat shit.

132
00:08:31,610 --> 00:08:33,610
- You puss bag!
- Down, girl.  Down, girl.

133
00:08:33,612 --> 00:08:35,745
Easy easy. Ronnie is right there.

134
00:08:35,747 --> 00:08:38,048
Just chill.

135
00:08:42,972 --> 00:08:45,372
Move it,
Fatty fat fat.

136
00:08:45,374 --> 00:08:46,757
Sorry.

137
00:08:46,759 --> 00:08:48,575
Dick.

138
00:08:48,577 --> 00:08:50,327
Well, look who's here.

139
00:08:50,329 --> 00:08:51,745
The camp problem child.

140
00:08:51,747 --> 00:08:54,514
Hey, Charlie. Can I get something else to eat?

141
00:08:54,516 --> 00:08:56,133
I'm on my way out, little man.

142
00:08:56,135 --> 00:08:58,168
Mickey will take care of you.

143
00:08:58,170 --> 00:08:59,703
Great.

144
00:09:01,039 --> 00:09:04,008
Hey, Mickey, didn't I tell you to put the goddamn trash bags

145
00:09:04,010 --> 00:09:06,359
In the dumpster? I'm infested with rats in here.

146
00:09:06,361 --> 00:09:08,412
Alright, don't blow an artery, okay?

147
00:09:08,414 --> 00:09:10,247
Just make sure you do it this time.

148
00:09:10,249 --> 00:09:12,466
I said I'd fucking do it, alright?

149
00:09:12,468 --> 00:09:14,184
Jesus christ!

150
00:09:14,186 --> 00:09:17,254
Should've fired your ass a long time ago.

151
00:09:17,256 --> 00:09:18,906
Yeah, you keep mumbling, old man.

152
00:09:22,828 --> 00:09:24,228
What do you want, fatty?

153
00:09:24,230 --> 00:09:27,347
I guess I'll have some ice cream.

154
00:09:34,489 --> 00:09:36,339
- Hey!
- Ice cream, my ass.

155
00:09:36,341 --> 00:09:38,608
I'll decide what you're gonna have. You ready?

156
00:09:38,610 --> 00:09:40,978
Egg salad or Tuna salad.

157
00:09:40,980 --> 00:09:43,380
That stuff sucks. I want ice cream.

158
00:09:43,382 --> 00:09:45,082
Well, that's tough shit, ain't it?

159
00:09:45,084 --> 00:09:47,117
Now hurry up, I'm busy.

160
00:09:53,642 --> 00:09:55,893
And stay the fuck out of my freezer

161
00:09:55,895 --> 00:09:57,761
Or I'll cut your tiny little balls off.

162
00:10:08,057 --> 00:10:09,856
Can we get more juice please, Petey?

163
00:10:09,858 --> 00:10:11,491
Sure.

164
00:10:13,696 --> 00:10:16,997
You little asshole. What did I just tell you?

165
00:10:16,999 --> 00:10:19,416
- Leave me alone.
- "leave me alone."

166
00:10:19,418 --> 00:10:21,986
You know, you're such a little girl, Alan. Get the fuck out.

167
00:10:21,988 --> 00:10:24,204
You suck, Mickey.

168
00:10:24,206 --> 00:10:26,273
I suck?

169
00:10:26,275 --> 00:10:28,909
Ow! You fucking bastard!

170
00:10:28,911 --> 00:10:30,210
I said get out.

171
00:10:30,212 --> 00:10:32,011
Oh yeah?

172
00:10:35,851 --> 00:10:37,133
What's this?

173
00:10:39,938 --> 00:10:41,422
That was nice aim, asshole.

174
00:10:43,258 --> 00:10:44,992
- Ow!
- Mickey.

175
00:10:44,994 --> 00:10:46,743
You fuckhead!

176
00:10:49,648 --> 00:10:51,264
Holy shit!

177
00:10:51,266 --> 00:10:52,365
My god!

178
00:10:54,303 --> 00:10:55,686
Are you insane?

179
00:10:55,688 --> 00:10:58,255
He was throwing eggs at me and he was hurting me.

180
00:10:58,257 --> 00:11:00,624
- So for that you try to kill him?
- Let me go, you big pussy.

181
00:11:00,626 --> 00:11:02,959
- You don't tell me what to do.
- Let me go!

182
00:11:02,961 --> 00:11:05,345
You all suck. I hope you die.

183
00:11:06,915 --> 00:11:08,616
- What a douche.
- Shut up, Mickey.

184
00:11:08,618 --> 00:11:10,083
I'm sure you started all this.

185
00:11:10,085 --> 00:11:12,403
Yeah, whatever.

186
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,887
Michael, go get your brother right now

187
00:11:13,889 --> 00:11:15,655
And bring him to Ronnie's shack on the double.

188
00:11:15,657 --> 00:11:16,957
Hey, he's only my stepbrother.

189
00:11:16,959 --> 00:11:18,492
I don't give a damn what he is.

190
00:11:18,494 --> 00:11:20,527
- Just do it.
- Yes, sir.

191
00:11:23,199 --> 00:11:24,932
You see what I have to put up with here?

192
00:11:24,934 --> 00:11:26,733
You'd think these kids would appreciate

193
00:11:26,735 --> 00:11:28,869
How hard we work to give them a nice summer.

194
00:11:28,871 --> 00:11:31,038
Goddamn kids.

195
00:11:39,047 --> 00:11:41,432
Hey, dickhead, slow down.

196
00:11:44,453 --> 00:11:46,837
Alan. Alan.

197
00:11:46,839 --> 00:11:48,772
Leave me alone.

198
00:11:48,774 --> 00:11:50,991
Pain in the ass.

199
00:11:55,130 --> 00:11:57,564
Come on, Alan, I've got to take you back.

200
00:11:57,566 --> 00:11:59,349
No.

201
00:12:04,840 --> 00:12:07,607
You know, I'm really getting tired of taking care of your ass.

202
00:12:07,609 --> 00:12:10,610
I'm not going back, Michael, Ever.

203
00:12:10,612 --> 00:12:12,963
Everyone's always picking on me.

204
00:12:12,965 --> 00:12:15,215
Stop crying, you big baby.

205
00:12:15,217 --> 00:12:18,368
"Everyone's always picking on me. Nobody likes me."

206
00:12:18,370 --> 00:12:20,637
Be quiet.

207
00:12:25,877 --> 00:12:27,794
Still dicking around with the frogs.

208
00:12:27,796 --> 00:12:30,029
They're my friends.

209
00:12:30,031 --> 00:12:31,765
Yeah, right.

210
00:12:31,767 --> 00:12:34,334
Whoa, look at this mother.

211
00:12:35,604 --> 00:12:37,637
- What are you doing?
- What?

212
00:12:39,742 --> 00:12:41,424
You hurt him.

213
00:12:41,426 --> 00:12:43,676
If he's hurt bad, i'll fucking kill you.

214
00:12:43,678 --> 00:12:46,179
Alan, they're fucking frogs.

215
00:12:46,181 --> 00:12:47,914
They're my friends.

216
00:12:47,916 --> 00:12:50,016
They don't care, if I was sick once.

217
00:12:50,018 --> 00:12:52,552
- They like me anyway.
- Here we go again.

218
00:12:52,554 --> 00:12:54,905
How long you gonna milk this rheumatic-fever bullshit?

219
00:12:54,907 --> 00:12:57,608
The doctor said there'd always be effects.

220
00:12:57,610 --> 00:12:59,309
Yeah, you'll always be an asshole.

221
00:12:59,311 --> 00:13:02,278
Now let's go. Frank wants us back at camp now.

222
00:13:02,280 --> 00:13:04,497
- I'm not going.
- Oh, yes, you are.

223
00:13:05,767 --> 00:13:08,969
I said I'm not going!

224
00:13:08,971 --> 00:13:11,305
And I said you are. Now let's go.

225
00:13:11,307 --> 00:13:13,039
No!

226
00:13:13,041 --> 00:13:16,292
You little asshole.

227
00:13:16,294 --> 00:13:18,595
I'm gonna kick your ass.

228
00:13:22,151 --> 00:13:23,917
Get out of here.

229
00:13:23,919 --> 00:13:25,652
Cut the shit, Alan.

230
00:13:25,654 --> 00:13:28,322
I'm not going back.

231
00:13:31,293 --> 00:13:34,110
Come on, Alan. Give me the knife.

232
00:13:36,815 --> 00:13:39,332
Come on, Alan. Give me the knife.

233
00:13:49,778 --> 00:13:52,262
Give me the fucking knife.

234
00:13:52,264 --> 00:13:54,848
You're fucking nuts, Alan. And you know what?

235
00:13:54,850 --> 00:13:57,550
I don't give a shit what you do anymore.

236
00:14:19,541 --> 00:14:21,458
Have a little din-din.

237
00:14:21,460 --> 00:14:23,360
Mickey's turn to eat.

238
00:14:23,362 --> 00:14:25,161
Yeah.

239
00:14:36,308 --> 00:14:38,675
"hey, Mickey,

240
00:14:38,677 --> 00:14:39,776
What's with the fryer?

241
00:14:39,778 --> 00:14:42,779
There more oils on it than in it."

242
00:14:44,249 --> 00:14:46,917
Why don't you just suck my dick, you old bastard?

243
00:15:01,033 --> 00:15:03,133
Oh fuck! Charlie?

244
00:15:03,135 --> 00:15:05,569
Huh?  Is that you? Put me the fuck down, alright?

245
00:15:05,571 --> 00:15:07,487
This isn't funny. Come on, put me down.

246
00:15:07,489 --> 00:15:09,740
Charlie, put me the fuck down. Ha ha ha.

247
00:15:09,742 --> 00:15:12,358
Hey! Hey, I'm not kidding with you now.

248
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:14,527
Who the fuck is that? Louis?  Huh?

249
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,629
Tracey, you better tell him to put me the fuck down.

250
00:15:16,631 --> 00:15:18,982
This is hot oil here, alright? I'm not joking around now.

251
00:15:18,984 --> 00:15:21,184
I'll kick your fucking ass, you little bitch.

252
00:15:21,186 --> 00:15:24,020
Put me down. Come on, who the fuck is that, huh?

253
00:15:24,022 --> 00:15:28,057
Hey, what the fuck are you-- What the fuck are you doing?

254
00:15:28,059 --> 00:15:30,444
Stop! Hey, what the fuck, man?

255
00:15:30,446 --> 00:15:32,529
Stop. This ain't funny, man.

256
00:15:32,531 --> 00:15:34,397
Whoa! What the fuck?

257
00:15:34,399 --> 00:15:37,734
What, are you crazy? Tell him to put me the fuck down, Louis.

258
00:15:37,736 --> 00:15:41,121
Hey, what the fuck, man? Stop, this ain't funny, man.

259
00:15:41,123 --> 00:15:43,856
It's oil. Put me the fuck down.

260
00:15:43,858 --> 00:15:46,042
Please put me down.

261
00:15:46,044 --> 00:15:49,029
Put me fucking down. Stop!

262
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:50,313
I'm getting tired, man.

263
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:53,066
Please put me the fuck down.

264
00:15:53,068 --> 00:15:55,402
Put me the fuck down! Put me down!

265
00:15:55,404 --> 00:15:56,770
Ow!

266
00:17:06,024 --> 00:17:08,358
I wouldn't build up my hopes if I were you, charlie.

267
00:17:08,360 --> 00:17:11,795
Like my mama said: you don't ask, you don't get.

268
00:17:11,797 --> 00:17:13,346
What's that thing?

269
00:17:13,348 --> 00:17:15,499
Frank's building an aviary for Matilda.

270
00:17:15,501 --> 00:17:16,900
Looks like a shrine.

271
00:17:16,902 --> 00:17:18,819
You know how much he loves that bird.

272
00:17:18,821 --> 00:17:21,588
Come in.

273
00:17:26,678 --> 00:17:28,645
Charlie needs to speak to you, Frank.

274
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:32,115
First say hello to Matilda. She's very excited to see you, Ronnie.

275
00:17:32,117 --> 00:17:34,651
- Hi,  Matilda.
- Say hi, Matilda.

276
00:17:34,653 --> 00:17:37,587
- Hi, Matilda.
- Isn't she so smart?

277
00:17:38,657 --> 00:17:41,458
I love you so much.

278
00:17:41,460 --> 00:17:43,794
I love you so much.

279
00:17:43,796 --> 00:17:45,561
I love you so much. Aah.

280
00:17:45,563 --> 00:17:48,198
I think she's starting to look a little like you, Frank.

281
00:17:48,200 --> 00:17:50,333
Is that a bad thing?

282
00:17:50,335 --> 00:17:52,652
Charlie's having problems in the kitchen again, Frank.

283
00:17:52,654 --> 00:17:54,804
It's that damn fool Mickey.

284
00:17:54,806 --> 00:17:57,107
Boy is useless, as tits on a bull.

285
00:17:57,109 --> 00:17:59,041
Just this night I told him to get the garbage out

286
00:17:59,043 --> 00:18:01,044
Before it attracts the rats into the kitchen.

287
00:18:01,046 --> 00:18:04,047
Garbage is still there and he's long gone.

288
00:18:04,049 --> 00:18:06,299
So fire the guy. He's probably on drugs anyway.

289
00:18:06,301 --> 00:18:10,086
Then we'll have to offer more money otherwise all. We'll get is another Mickey.

290
00:18:10,088 --> 00:18:11,804
Look, fellas.

291
00:18:11,806 --> 00:18:14,224
I'm not paying any more money

292
00:18:14,226 --> 00:18:15,926
For perfect attendance.

293
00:18:15,928 --> 00:18:17,928
That's clear, huh?

294
00:18:17,930 --> 00:18:20,964
Now are we done here? 'Cause i got things to do.

295
00:18:20,966 --> 00:18:23,499
We still didn't do anything about the rats by the compactor.

296
00:18:23,501 --> 00:18:25,302
Again with the rats?

297
00:18:25,304 --> 00:18:27,838
They're a health risk, Frank. And I say we do something about them.

298
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,006
Don't forget, I own a piece of the place too.

299
00:18:30,008 --> 00:18:33,343
Yeah? And don't you forget it's a very small piece.

300
00:18:33,345 --> 00:18:34,911
That's not fair, Frank.

301
00:18:34,913 --> 00:18:36,880
I'm just playing with you, Bubbie.

302
00:18:36,882 --> 00:18:40,516
Come on. Charlie, replace that guy in the kitchen.

303
00:18:40,518 --> 00:18:42,852
We'll talk about the rats later, I promise.

304
00:18:42,854 --> 00:18:44,454
Fine.

305
00:18:44,456 --> 00:18:46,639
Oh, look at my baby.

306
00:18:48,577 --> 00:18:50,544
Say goodbye, Matilda.

307
00:18:50,546 --> 00:18:52,045
Goodbye, Matilda.

308
00:18:52,047 --> 00:18:55,148
Now if you gentlemen will excuse me,

309
00:18:55,150 --> 00:18:57,550
I have to use the John.

310
00:18:57,552 --> 00:19:00,253
Too many beans in that casserole, Charlie.

311
00:19:00,255 --> 00:19:01,955
Yeah, right.

312
00:19:04,359 --> 00:19:06,259
Tightass motherfucker.

313
00:19:07,445 --> 00:19:10,997
Hey, I didn't know you and Frank were partners.

314
00:19:10,999 --> 00:19:12,865
Only a junior partner. And believe me,

315
00:19:12,867 --> 00:19:16,136
There's nothing more junior than being a junior partner of Frank's.

316
00:19:53,725 --> 00:19:57,544
Dude, you're taking, like, forever.

317
00:19:57,546 --> 00:19:59,312
I'm trying, man.

318
00:19:59,314 --> 00:20:02,482
You know this dried cow manure is hard to roll.

319
00:20:02,484 --> 00:20:05,685
Who are we gonna get to smoke it this year?

320
00:20:05,687 --> 00:20:06,987
I don't know, man.

321
00:20:06,989 --> 00:20:10,223
We already got spaz last year.

322
00:20:10,225 --> 00:20:11,608
That was awesome.

323
00:20:11,610 --> 00:20:14,310
I laughed my ass off for a week.

324
00:20:16,030 --> 00:20:20,450
I'm sure we'll find another trusting soul around here somewhere.

325
00:20:20,452 --> 00:20:25,121
Hey, you're licking, like, cow shit, man.

326
00:20:25,123 --> 00:20:28,741
Whew. Good save, man.

327
00:20:28,743 --> 00:20:30,727
Yeah.

328
00:20:38,820 --> 00:20:40,687
Shut up, doofus.

329
00:20:44,276 --> 00:20:46,309
- Hey!
- Thanks, pee pee.

330
00:20:46,311 --> 00:20:49,979
Why don't you go bother Karen? Everyone knows you like her.

331
00:20:49,981 --> 00:20:51,898
Why, is she here?

332
00:20:51,900 --> 00:20:53,566
She's over there.

333
00:20:59,140 --> 00:21:01,441
- Oh no.
- What?

334
00:21:01,443 --> 00:21:05,362
Oh look. It's Karen's, Little crush.

335
00:21:05,364 --> 00:21:07,497
Does he ever take those freakin' pants off?

336
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:10,934
Yeah, it could be, like, 500 degrees out and he'd still have them on.

337
00:21:10,936 --> 00:21:13,236
Good one, spaz.

338
00:21:13,238 --> 00:21:15,622
Just ignore him, okay? I don't want him coming over here.

339
00:21:15,624 --> 00:21:19,042
Oh, don't worry. Yo, Alan, come here, buddy.

340
00:21:21,412 --> 00:21:22,578
Really?

341
00:21:22,580 --> 00:21:24,447
Yeah, come on.

342
00:21:24,449 --> 00:21:25,998
Awesome!

343
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:28,000
See you later, losers.

344
00:21:38,747 --> 00:21:40,012
Thanks, T.C.

345
00:21:40,014 --> 00:21:41,431
Yeah, no problem.

346
00:21:41,433 --> 00:21:43,366
Now you guys have to promise to stay.

347
00:21:43,368 --> 00:21:45,168
I don't want to be left alone with him.

348
00:21:45,170 --> 00:21:47,737
Are you kidding? I love Alan.

349
00:21:47,739 --> 00:21:49,139
Hey, guys. What's going on?

350
00:21:49,141 --> 00:21:51,607
Hey, dickwad. What's that on your shirt?

351
00:21:51,609 --> 00:21:54,059
- What?
- What a tool.

352
00:21:55,730 --> 00:21:57,731
Come on, guys, let's get something to eat

353
00:21:57,733 --> 00:22:00,399
Before Bella wipes out the canteen.

354
00:22:01,703 --> 00:22:04,237
Oh, that's really cute, guys.
Thanks.

355
00:22:04,239 --> 00:22:06,072
Thanks a lot.

356
00:22:08,543 --> 00:22:10,527
Hey, Karen, how are you?

357
00:22:10,529 --> 00:22:12,595
Great, Alan. I'm great.

358
00:22:12,597 --> 00:22:15,965
Want something? Some soda, licorice?

359
00:22:15,967 --> 00:22:18,501
I'm fine, Alan. I'm just fine.

360
00:22:18,503 --> 00:22:21,304
Okay.

361
00:22:25,727 --> 00:22:27,594
What's that smell?

362
00:22:27,596 --> 00:22:29,161
What smell?

363
00:22:30,532 --> 00:22:32,331
Oh my god,
It's you.

364
00:22:32,333 --> 00:22:34,117
Me?

365
00:22:34,119 --> 00:22:36,519
Oh, Mickey threw eggs at me before.

366
00:22:36,521 --> 00:22:38,487
And you didn't change your clothes?

367
00:22:38,489 --> 00:22:41,324
God, i don't know who's more disgusting, you or Mickey.

368
00:22:41,326 --> 00:22:44,727
You mean you don't like Mickey either?

369
00:22:44,729 --> 00:22:46,830
Are you kidding? He cornered me in the kitchen

370
00:22:46,832 --> 00:22:48,664
One night while i was doing cleanup.

371
00:22:48,666 --> 00:22:50,466
Good thing Ronnie walked in.

372
00:22:50,468 --> 00:22:52,002
He's lucky I wasn't there.

373
00:22:52,004 --> 00:22:54,204
I would have killed him if he'd done anything to you.

374
00:22:55,641 --> 00:22:57,824
Wow, Alan. You must have some pair of balls.

375
00:22:57,826 --> 00:22:59,309
Let go!

376
00:22:59,311 --> 00:23:02,595
Do you really think that I forgot what you did to me at dinner tonight?

377
00:23:02,597 --> 00:23:04,481
- Do you?
- Ow, it hurts!

378
00:23:04,483 --> 00:23:07,683
That's the point, assface.

379
00:23:07,685 --> 00:23:09,869
He ain't got much of a package there anyway.

380
00:23:09,871 --> 00:23:11,237
That was funny, Bella.

381
00:23:11,239 --> 00:23:13,473
But what i'm in the mood for is a purple nurple.

382
00:23:13,475 --> 00:23:15,191
Stop! Let go!

383
00:23:15,193 --> 00:23:17,460
You want more? You want more?

384
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:19,929
Stop!

385
00:23:19,931 --> 00:23:23,649
Hey, T.C., have a nice trip?

386
00:23:23,651 --> 00:23:25,552
Fuck you, Bella.

387
00:23:25,554 --> 00:23:28,270
You're fucking dead, Alan.

388
00:23:30,492 --> 00:23:32,359
What, do I got a rumble going on here?

389
00:23:32,361 --> 00:23:34,728
T.C. was picking on Alan again.

390
00:23:34,730 --> 00:23:36,629
That's bull. You saw him push me.

391
00:23:36,631 --> 00:23:38,097
He's always picking on me.

392
00:23:38,099 --> 00:23:40,233
You don't belong here anyway. Get back to your cabin.

393
00:23:40,235 --> 00:23:43,069
- Don't touch me.
- You don't talk back to me, young man.

394
00:23:43,071 --> 00:23:45,538
I'm not one of these little boys, you can push around.

395
00:23:45,540 --> 00:23:49,158
Now you get going before I kick your behind all the way down the hill.

396
00:23:49,160 --> 00:23:50,876
I'm going.

397
00:23:50,878 --> 00:23:52,112
A little faster.

398
00:23:52,114 --> 00:23:53,429
Your ass stinks.

399
00:23:53,431 --> 00:23:55,949
- What did you say?
- Nothing.

400
00:23:55,951 --> 00:23:57,834
Night, Alan.

401
00:23:57,836 --> 00:23:59,635
Zip it up, T.C.

402
00:23:59,637 --> 00:24:01,671
And stop acting like a putz.

403
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,549
Hey, weed.

404
00:24:15,820 --> 00:24:18,138
- What are you guys doing?
- Get out of here, man.

405
00:24:18,140 --> 00:24:20,439
- Yo, dude.
- What?

406
00:24:21,843 --> 00:24:24,144
Oh yeah.

407
00:24:24,146 --> 00:24:27,146
Hey, Alan.

408
00:24:27,148 --> 00:24:29,415
You, um-- You party?

409
00:24:30,885 --> 00:24:32,685
Yeah, I party.

410
00:24:32,687 --> 00:24:35,455
You want to try some really good shit?

411
00:24:35,457 --> 00:24:37,757
Yeah, sure.

412
00:24:37,759 --> 00:24:41,193
It just so happens i got a nice fatty right here.

413
00:24:41,195 --> 00:24:43,529
- Be quiet.
- It's a joint, schmeckle.

414
00:24:43,531 --> 00:24:46,632
Oh, I thought you said something else.

415
00:24:46,634 --> 00:24:48,768
- Light him up, stanny.
- Covered.

416
00:24:48,770 --> 00:24:52,071
Just be careful, man. This shit is really strong.

417
00:24:52,073 --> 00:24:53,873
What it is, gold?

418
00:24:53,875 --> 00:24:56,876
No, man. It's just some really good brown.

419
00:25:03,701 --> 00:25:06,202
Come on, man. You got to take big tokes

420
00:25:06,204 --> 00:25:08,438
And hold it in, otherwise you're wasting it.

421
00:25:08,440 --> 00:25:10,639
Sorry.

422
00:25:12,477 --> 00:25:14,477
It's good, huh?

423
00:25:14,479 --> 00:25:16,779
Yeah.
Here.

424
00:25:16,781 --> 00:25:18,381
Whoa, hold on, man.

425
00:25:18,383 --> 00:25:20,816
You got to take a really big hit, you know?

426
00:25:20,818 --> 00:25:23,319
You got to catch up with the rest of us.

427
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:25,121
Okay.

428
00:25:32,297 --> 00:25:34,280
You got a buzz yet, Al?

429
00:25:34,282 --> 00:25:36,883
Yeah, this stuff's awesome.

430
00:25:48,797 --> 00:25:50,630
Well, isn't this cute?

431
00:25:50,632 --> 00:25:53,849
Alan's giving stan some head.

432
00:25:56,587 --> 00:25:57,821
Is it good, stan?

433
00:25:57,823 --> 00:25:59,672
Sweet, dude.

434
00:26:03,595 --> 00:26:05,044
I got an idea.

435
00:26:05,046 --> 00:26:07,847
I think from now on we should call Alan "blowjob."

436
00:26:07,849 --> 00:26:10,332
Hey, I like it.

437
00:26:10,334 --> 00:26:12,601
What do you think, blowjob?

438
00:26:13,755 --> 00:26:15,721
Don't call me that.

439
00:26:15,723 --> 00:26:19,041
Hey, blowjob, you don't look so good.

440
00:26:19,043 --> 00:26:20,360
What do you expect, man?

441
00:26:20,362 --> 00:26:23,596
Blowjob just smoked an entire joint full of cowshit.

442
00:26:23,598 --> 00:26:25,298
No way.

443
00:26:25,300 --> 00:26:27,066
You're full of shit, weed.

444
00:26:27,068 --> 00:26:29,452
No, blowjob, you're full of shit.

445
00:26:29,454 --> 00:26:31,654
Don't call me that.

446
00:26:31,656 --> 00:26:33,972
Oh, we're sorry... Blowjob.

447
00:26:33,974 --> 00:26:37,643
- Shut up!
- Knock it off.

448
00:26:37,645 --> 00:26:40,129
Tell them to stop calling me that, Petey. Tell them to stop.

449
00:26:40,131 --> 00:26:41,930
Come on, Alan. Let's get out of here.

450
00:26:43,268 --> 00:26:45,368
Excuse me.

451
00:26:45,370 --> 00:26:48,070
His name's blowjob.

452
00:26:48,072 --> 00:26:51,291
Shut up, weed, or I'll tell Ronnie what you guys were just doing.

453
00:26:51,293 --> 00:26:53,626
- We're cool.
- Oh, busted.

454
00:26:53,628 --> 00:26:56,946
- Shut up.
- Stan, damn, it smelled really gross.

455
00:26:56,948 --> 00:26:58,580
What's going on?

456
00:26:58,582 --> 00:27:00,750
What do you think's going on?

457
00:27:00,752 --> 00:27:03,335
These hooligans were making fun of Alan again.

458
00:27:03,337 --> 00:27:05,288
Oh, we were just kidding around.

459
00:27:05,290 --> 00:27:06,456
Right, blowjob?

460
00:27:06,458 --> 00:27:08,074
Tell them to shut up.

461
00:27:08,076 --> 00:27:09,842
Alright, you four get back to your bunks

462
00:27:09,844 --> 00:27:11,895
And don't move a muscle till I get there.

463
00:27:11,897 --> 00:27:13,997
Come on, Alan. You need to go to bed now.

464
00:27:17,918 --> 00:27:20,436
Hey, boys.

465
00:27:34,069 --> 00:27:36,302
Dude, how many joints..

466
00:27:36,304 --> 00:27:38,504
..you think we can smoke in one night?

467
00:27:38,506 --> 00:27:41,073
Really. Stan's wiped.

468
00:27:41,075 --> 00:27:42,775
And look at Evey.

469
00:27:42,777 --> 00:27:45,811
Hey, I told you guys, okay?

470
00:27:45,813 --> 00:27:48,114
I really want to get whacked tonight.

471
00:27:48,116 --> 00:27:49,982
You're just pissed

472
00:27:49,984 --> 00:27:52,285
Ronnie gave us so much shit about Alan.

473
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:55,905
Yeah, like I care.

474
00:27:57,142 --> 00:27:58,741
Hey, there's gas in those cans.

475
00:27:58,743 --> 00:28:00,676
What are you trying to do, blow us up?

476
00:28:00,678 --> 00:28:02,811
Really, dude.

477
00:28:02,813 --> 00:28:04,864
Get off the rag, man.

478
00:28:04,866 --> 00:28:07,750
Eat me, Stanny.

479
00:28:07,752 --> 00:28:10,503
I think we're gonna go, guys. Evey.

480
00:28:10,505 --> 00:28:14,824
What are you talking about? It's only, like, 2 O'Clock.

481
00:28:14,826 --> 00:28:16,058
Hey, we just want to go, okay?

482
00:28:16,060 --> 00:28:18,010
You know, Sue,

483
00:28:18,012 --> 00:28:21,163
Just do whatever you want.

484
00:28:21,165 --> 00:28:22,432
Gee, thanks, weed.

485
00:28:22,434 --> 00:28:24,467
- Come on, Evey. Time to go.
- What?

486
00:28:24,469 --> 00:28:27,836
- Come on.
- No.

487
00:28:27,838 --> 00:28:29,505
Weed, come on, dude. Let's roll, man.

488
00:28:29,507 --> 00:28:31,207
You're falling out.

489
00:28:31,209 --> 00:28:33,909
Plus, If Ronnie catches us down here we'll really be screwed.

490
00:28:33,911 --> 00:28:36,045
Fuck him, alright?

491
00:28:36,047 --> 00:28:38,815
I'm staying.

492
00:28:38,817 --> 00:28:41,684
Whatever, man. I'm out of here.

493
00:28:41,686 --> 00:28:43,152
Sue, wait up.

494
00:28:43,154 --> 00:28:46,088
Bye. Bye, go away.

495
00:28:46,090 --> 00:28:48,774
- Leave.
- Hey, wait up.

496
00:28:48,776 --> 00:28:50,475
Bye. Go away.

497
00:28:52,613 --> 00:28:54,580
Fuck them.

498
00:29:26,014 --> 00:29:27,813
Hey, man, what are you doing?

499
00:29:35,206 --> 00:29:37,256
Fuck off, Stan. Let me sleep.

500
00:30:49,563 --> 00:30:51,730
Weed!  No way!

501
00:30:51,732 --> 00:30:53,982
No!

502
00:30:53,984 --> 00:30:56,635
No fucking way, man.

503
00:30:56,637 --> 00:30:59,872
No!  Weed!

504
00:30:59,874 --> 00:31:01,123
Weed!

505
00:31:01,125 --> 00:31:04,960
I told you to get those campers back to bed now.

506
00:31:04,962 --> 00:31:06,662
Now get moving.

507
00:31:06,664 --> 00:31:09,181
- It'll be alright.
- No way!

508
00:31:09,183 --> 00:31:10,766
I got a bad feeling about this, Frank.

509
00:31:10,768 --> 00:31:13,001
Yeah, and I feel good. We're gonna lose over half the camp.

510
00:31:13,003 --> 00:31:14,836
That's thousands of dollars.

511
00:31:14,838 --> 00:31:16,738
We found this near the body.

512
00:31:16,740 --> 00:31:18,974
See, what did I tell you? Drugs.

513
00:31:18,976 --> 00:31:20,426
Goddamn drugs.

514
00:31:20,428 --> 00:31:22,845
I think there's more to it, Frank.

515
00:31:22,847 --> 00:31:25,648
- Here we go again.
- What does that mean?

516
00:31:25,650 --> 00:31:27,716
Every time something happens around here

517
00:31:27,718 --> 00:31:29,851
He thinks he's back at camp Arawak.

518
00:31:29,853 --> 00:31:33,405
Arawak? Isn't that where that kid went on a killing spree?

519
00:31:33,407 --> 00:31:36,308
Yeah, that's the place. Ruined the camp business for years.

520
00:31:36,310 --> 00:31:38,344
Ronnie was the head counselor over there.

521
00:31:38,346 --> 00:31:40,046
What happened to that kid?

522
00:31:40,048 --> 00:31:42,197
What happened to the kid?

523
00:31:42,199 --> 00:31:44,249
Her name was Angela. Last I heard she was locked up

524
00:31:44,251 --> 00:31:46,351
In a sanitarium outside rochester.

525
00:31:46,353 --> 00:31:47,503
He was locked up.

526
00:31:47,505 --> 00:31:49,738
What was that?

527
00:31:49,740 --> 00:31:52,591
The girl Angela-- Turned out she was a 'He'.

528
00:31:52,593 --> 00:31:56,162
And the kid pretended he was the sister who died years before.

529
00:31:56,164 --> 00:31:58,530
- You believe that?
- Sounds pretty bizarre.

530
00:31:58,532 --> 00:32:00,832
You sure he's still locked up?

531
00:32:00,834 --> 00:32:02,368
As far as I know.

532
00:32:02,370 --> 00:32:04,236
You could talk to her cousin Ricky.

533
00:32:04,238 --> 00:32:05,837
He's up in Anslin.

534
00:32:05,839 --> 00:32:07,306
Maybe I'll do that.

535
00:32:07,308 --> 00:32:09,007
We're about wrapped here, sheriff.

536
00:32:09,009 --> 00:32:10,475
- Thanks, Al.
- You got it.

537
00:32:10,477 --> 00:32:12,478
Sheriff, thanks for everything.

538
00:32:12,480 --> 00:32:14,046
But we've got things to do.

539
00:32:14,048 --> 00:32:16,315
So you let me know if anything comes up, Okay?

540
00:32:16,317 --> 00:32:18,084
- Will do.
- Okay, thanks.

541
00:32:19,720 --> 00:32:21,570
Are you out of your goddamn mind?

542
00:32:21,572 --> 00:32:23,605
Sorry, Frank. I just didn't think--

543
00:32:23,607 --> 00:32:25,908
Don't think. Now you listen to me.

544
00:32:25,910 --> 00:32:29,845
I don't want to hear another word about this Angela crap.

545
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,247
- Understand?
- Yeah.

546
00:32:32,249 --> 00:32:34,316
Now clean up this mess.

547
00:32:34,318 --> 00:32:35,951
Look at these campers out here.

548
00:32:35,953 --> 00:32:38,537
We're lucky if we're not closed down by tomorrow.

549
00:32:38,539 --> 00:32:40,088
Alright. I'll take care of it.

550
00:32:42,092 --> 00:32:44,393
Goddamn idiot.

551
00:33:24,918 --> 00:33:26,651
You're so stupid, Alan.

552
00:33:28,573 --> 00:33:29,921
Alan!

553
00:33:36,547 --> 00:33:39,331
Come on, Bella. It's your turn.

554
00:33:39,333 --> 00:33:41,634
You know I hate this stupid-ass game.

555
00:33:44,305 --> 00:33:45,938
What the fuck?

556
00:33:47,508 --> 00:33:49,759
Man, this thing's heavy. Ow!

557
00:33:49,761 --> 00:33:52,561
Alan, get your fat ass out of here now.

558
00:33:52,563 --> 00:33:54,530
Let go, you big lezbo.

559
00:33:55,833 --> 00:33:58,768
Go play with your own bunk.

560
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:02,605
I just wanted to ask Karen if she would go to my secret hideout with me.

561
00:34:02,607 --> 00:34:05,090
Whoo, secret hideout.

562
00:34:05,092 --> 00:34:07,126
Don't encourage him, Dina.

563
00:34:07,128 --> 00:34:10,863
Please, Karen? Just this one time.
Please?

564
00:34:10,865 --> 00:34:12,615
Alan, just go away, okay?

565
00:34:13,818 --> 00:34:16,118
I'm not leaving until you say yes.

566
00:34:18,372 --> 00:34:20,156
Alan!

567
00:34:20,158 --> 00:34:22,807
Karen, would you just say yes so we can get rid of him?

568
00:34:22,809 --> 00:34:24,009
Are you kidding me?

569
00:34:24,011 --> 00:34:26,479
Come on, Karen. Or he's never gonna leave.

570
00:34:26,481 --> 00:34:29,148
If he don't leave soon, I'm gonna shove this mallet up his ass

571
00:34:29,150 --> 00:34:30,949
And it ain't gonna be pretty, girls.

572
00:34:30,951 --> 00:34:32,768
He's ruining the game, Karen.

573
00:34:32,770 --> 00:34:34,169
This is unbelievable.

574
00:34:34,171 --> 00:34:37,105
Oh, come on, Karen. Give the kid a thrill.

575
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:41,793
I can't believe you guys are doing this to me.

576
00:34:41,795 --> 00:34:43,229
Come on, it'll be fun.

577
00:34:43,231 --> 00:34:44,863
Yeah, really.

578
00:34:46,183 --> 00:34:48,550
Okay, Alan, you win.

579
00:34:48,552 --> 00:34:50,236
Awesome!

580
00:34:50,238 --> 00:34:53,021
But only if I can bring someone with me.

581
00:34:53,023 --> 00:34:55,540
Okay, who?

582
00:34:55,542 --> 00:34:57,175
Marie.

583
00:34:57,177 --> 00:34:58,393
What?

584
00:34:58,395 --> 00:35:01,096
Marie? I like Marie too.

585
00:35:01,098 --> 00:35:02,531
I'll see you at the lake?

586
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,832
I can't wait.

587
00:35:03,834 --> 00:35:05,868
Now could you go or do I have to smack you?

588
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,986
I'm leaving. I'm leaving.

589
00:35:07,988 --> 00:35:09,721
See you girls later.

590
00:35:10,975 --> 00:35:12,341
You too, Bella.

591
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:15,060
You little ass eater.

592
00:35:16,114 --> 00:35:19,348
Hey, Bella. Your ass stinks.

593
00:35:21,752 --> 00:35:23,602
Wait a minute. What just happened here?

594
00:35:23,604 --> 00:35:25,671
You got hosed.

595
00:35:28,208 --> 00:35:30,542
Let's go, boys. We got paintball.

596
00:35:32,113 --> 00:35:34,346
Hey, guys, wait up.

597
00:35:36,784 --> 00:35:38,450
Cut it out.

598
00:35:38,452 --> 00:35:40,936
Stop it, dick.

599
00:35:43,824 --> 00:35:45,590
Guys, wait up.

600
00:35:47,478 --> 00:35:49,227
Guys!

601
00:36:17,185 --> 00:36:18,714
Alan, over here.

602
00:36:19,310 --> 00:36:20,558
Blowjob, this way.

603
00:36:20,560 --> 00:36:23,695
Hey, shut up.

604
00:36:49,306 --> 00:36:50,989
Uh-oh.

605
00:37:03,403 --> 00:37:05,020
Hey, guys, I found them. Let's go.

606
00:37:06,991 --> 00:37:09,341
Come on, you pussies. Let's go.

607
00:37:12,746 --> 00:37:14,380
What are you guys doing?

608
00:37:14,382 --> 00:37:16,215
Guys?

609
00:37:16,217 --> 00:37:19,851
Guys, what-- What are you doing?

610
00:38:38,616 --> 00:38:41,817
I hate you!

611
00:38:41,819 --> 00:38:44,820
I hate you so bad.

612
00:39:10,197 --> 00:39:12,331
Hey, I'm working here.

613
00:39:12,333 --> 00:39:14,649
You must be Ricky.

614
00:39:15,903 --> 00:39:17,102
What's with the voice?

615
00:39:17,104 --> 00:39:20,422
The big C. Too many of those.

616
00:39:20,424 --> 00:39:22,391
Ain't life a bitch?

617
00:39:22,393 --> 00:39:25,294
- So are you Ricky?
- You know I am, so cut the shit.

618
00:39:25,296 --> 00:39:28,563
The head counselor over at camp manabe

619
00:39:28,565 --> 00:39:30,832
Said this accident that happened over there

620
00:39:30,834 --> 00:39:32,801
May be related to your cousin Angela.

621
00:39:32,803 --> 00:39:34,353
Oh yeah? That's a good one

622
00:39:34,355 --> 00:39:36,921
Considering she's been locked in a rubber room for the last 20 years.

623
00:39:36,923 --> 00:39:38,573
You sure about that?

624
00:39:38,575 --> 00:39:41,026
Yeah, I'm sure. I go to see her every few weeks.

625
00:39:41,028 --> 00:39:43,695
I'm the only one who goes to see her.

626
00:39:43,697 --> 00:39:45,747
- You mean him.
- What?

627
00:39:45,749 --> 00:39:47,182
Him.

628
00:39:47,184 --> 00:39:50,402
Angela is really a man now, isn't she?

629
00:39:50,404 --> 00:39:52,621
You know what? Fuck you.

630
00:39:52,623 --> 00:39:54,589
I got to get back to work.

631
00:39:54,591 --> 00:39:56,942
If anything else happens I may be back.

632
00:39:56,944 --> 00:40:00,412
- That a threat?
- No, I just might need your help.

633
00:40:00,414 --> 00:40:02,497
Knock yourself out, deputy dawg.

634
00:40:16,897 --> 00:40:19,431
One day I'll show them.

635
00:40:19,433 --> 00:40:23,001
They'll all wish they were my friends.

636
00:40:23,003 --> 00:40:24,269
Well, we're here.

637
00:40:25,939 --> 00:40:27,706
I can't believe it.

638
00:40:27,708 --> 00:40:29,874
What are you doing here?

639
00:40:29,876 --> 00:40:31,876
That seems to be the question of the day.

640
00:40:31,878 --> 00:40:34,279
Well, come on, come on, sit down.

641
00:40:36,083 --> 00:40:37,949
Hey, you guys want some soda?

642
00:40:37,951 --> 00:40:41,986
Um, yeah, sure. Why not?

643
00:40:41,988 --> 00:40:45,507
Ew.  What's with all the frogs?

644
00:40:45,509 --> 00:40:47,709
Oh, they won't hurt you.

645
00:40:47,711 --> 00:40:49,378
They're my friends.

646
00:40:51,598 --> 00:40:53,565
Besides Michael, you and Marie

647
00:40:53,567 --> 00:40:55,517
Are the only two people that have been here.

648
00:40:58,288 --> 00:41:01,039
Gee, what an honor.

649
00:41:03,961 --> 00:41:07,112
So what do you do around here, Alan?

650
00:41:07,114 --> 00:41:10,165
It seems kind of lonely.

651
00:41:11,752 --> 00:41:13,585
What is it?

652
00:41:13,587 --> 00:41:15,553
Oh my god!

653
00:41:15,555 --> 00:41:17,522
What?

654
00:41:17,524 --> 00:41:20,325
- Where are you going?
- You are so sick.

655
00:41:22,596 --> 00:41:24,896
No!

656
00:41:24,898 --> 00:41:27,683
Oh no!

657
00:41:27,685 --> 00:41:29,401
Oh no!

658
00:41:29,403 --> 00:41:33,688
No no no!

659
00:41:33,690 --> 00:41:35,807
No no no!

660
00:41:35,809 --> 00:41:37,575
No.

661
00:41:37,577 --> 00:41:38,977
What's happening?

662
00:41:38,979 --> 00:41:41,546
Who did this to you?

663
00:41:41,548 --> 00:41:43,247
That was fucking awesome, dude.

664
00:41:43,249 --> 00:41:45,149
Well, you know the old saying, Vinny.

665
00:41:45,151 --> 00:41:48,152
There's nothing like a finely sharpened knife when you're skinning frogs.

666
00:41:48,154 --> 00:41:50,121
True that.

667
00:41:50,123 --> 00:41:52,691
- You did this?
- Shit, yeah.

668
00:41:53,861 --> 00:41:55,827
But why?

669
00:41:55,829 --> 00:41:58,714
Why? 'Cause it was freakin' cool, man.

670
00:41:58,716 --> 00:42:01,517
Sure scared the shit out of Karen and Marie, didn't we, buddy?

671
00:42:01,519 --> 00:42:03,752
Brought it home, brother.

672
00:42:03,754 --> 00:42:05,453
How could you?

673
00:42:06,890 --> 00:42:09,091
How could you, you fuck?

674
00:42:10,878 --> 00:42:12,594
Kiss my ass, sick boy.

675
00:42:12,596 --> 00:42:14,880
Don't say that.

676
00:42:14,882 --> 00:42:16,297
We're out of here, Vinny.

677
00:42:16,299 --> 00:42:18,499
Our work here is done.

678
00:42:18,501 --> 00:42:22,237
I hate you. I hate you so bad.

679
00:42:22,239 --> 00:42:24,122
Karen!

680
00:42:24,124 --> 00:42:25,824
I got to tell Karen.

681
00:42:27,628 --> 00:42:28,843
Karen!

682
00:42:28,845 --> 00:42:30,912
Oh hey, where are you going, honey?

683
00:42:30,914 --> 00:42:32,981
Karen!

684
00:42:32,983 --> 00:42:34,816
Karen, you don't understand.

685
00:42:34,818 --> 00:42:37,219
Get away from me, you freak.

686
00:42:37,221 --> 00:42:38,770
Karen, you don't understand.

687
00:42:38,772 --> 00:42:41,072
It wasn't me, Karen. I didn't do it.

688
00:42:41,074 --> 00:42:44,760
Hey, blowjob's here.

689
00:42:44,762 --> 00:42:47,428
Stop calling me that. 
Karen!

690
00:42:55,272 --> 00:42:57,906
- What?
- Linda, get him away from us.

691
00:42:57,908 --> 00:43:01,143
Alan, you need to get out of here and leave my girls alone.

692
00:43:01,145 --> 00:43:03,044
You shut up. I have to talk to Karen.

693
00:43:03,046 --> 00:43:05,781
- You crying again, fat boy?
- Get out of here, Randy.

694
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:07,983
Oh, you got me really scared.

695
00:43:07,985 --> 00:43:09,751
Listen, Karen, I didn't do it.

696
00:43:09,753 --> 00:43:12,521
Look, I didn't do it. I love my frogs.

697
00:43:12,523 --> 00:43:14,122
Just stay away from me, Alan.

698
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:17,125
I need you off my dock without a bathing suit.

699
00:43:17,127 --> 00:43:19,160
I was just trying to talk to Karen.

700
00:43:19,162 --> 00:43:20,946
I don't care if you came here to talk to your aunt Tilly.

701
00:43:20,948 --> 00:43:23,281
I need you off my dock without a bathing suit on.

702
00:43:23,283 --> 00:43:25,751
Alan, beat off.

703
00:43:25,753 --> 00:43:27,769
Screw you, you ugly whore.

704
00:43:27,771 --> 00:43:30,889
Hey, Alan, that's no way to talk to ladies.

705
00:43:30,891 --> 00:43:32,791
Boys, wedgie.

706
00:43:51,896 --> 00:43:54,662
Whoo!

707
00:43:56,933 --> 00:43:58,767
Alan!

708
00:44:02,156 --> 00:44:04,540
Easy, Alan.

709
00:44:05,776 --> 00:44:08,343
Calm down. Everything's alright.

710
00:44:08,345 --> 00:44:11,079
Oh look, now there goes a handsome couple.

711
00:44:11,081 --> 00:44:13,965
You're a fucking bitch, Linda. You know that?

712
00:44:13,967 --> 00:44:16,885
Oh, that really hurts coming from a skank like you.

713
00:44:16,887 --> 00:44:19,804
I hate them. I hate all of them.

714
00:44:19,806 --> 00:44:23,207
- I wish I could kill them.
- Take it easy, Alan.

715
00:44:23,209 --> 00:44:24,609
You're gonna make yourself sick.

716
00:44:24,611 --> 00:44:26,979
It's a little late for that.

717
00:44:26,981 --> 00:44:28,513
Fuck you!

718
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:34,669
What's going on here? What happened to him?

719
00:44:34,671 --> 00:44:36,204
What do you think happened?

720
00:44:36,206 --> 00:44:38,373
When are you gonna do something about this?

721
00:44:46,600 --> 00:44:49,000
Come on, Karen. Don't be such a wuss.

722
00:44:49,002 --> 00:44:51,135
Yeah, you know we can't do this without you.

723
00:44:51,137 --> 00:44:53,772
I don't know. Hasn't he been through enough already?

724
00:44:53,774 --> 00:44:55,323
Come on, just a little joke.

725
00:44:55,325 --> 00:44:57,642
And besides, he likes it when we make fun of him.

726
00:44:57,644 --> 00:44:59,744
That's right. He thinks we like him

727
00:44:59,746 --> 00:45:02,114
Because we take the time to beat the shit out of him.

728
00:45:02,116 --> 00:45:04,665
Oh yeah, that makes a lot of sense, T.C.

729
00:45:04,667 --> 00:45:06,668
Come on, Karen, it'll be a riot.

730
00:45:06,670 --> 00:45:08,704
Hey, shush up. Here he comes.

731
00:45:12,526 --> 00:45:14,626
Evening, b-b-b--

732
00:45:16,730 --> 00:45:19,114
- Blowjob.
- You better shut up, T.C.

733
00:45:19,116 --> 00:45:22,033
- I didn't say anything.
- Lay off, T.C., okay?

734
00:45:30,677 --> 00:45:32,844
Come on, doll. Better hurry up.

735
00:45:32,846 --> 00:45:34,779
We're gonna miss our reservation.

736
00:45:34,781 --> 00:45:37,282
Oh, sweetheart,

737
00:45:37,284 --> 00:45:40,252
You really should have thought about that 15 minutes ago.

738
00:45:40,254 --> 00:45:42,120
Hmm?

739
00:45:42,122 --> 00:45:43,621
Come on, we're gonna be late.

740
00:45:43,623 --> 00:45:45,656
- Come on.
- We're gonna be late.

741
00:45:45,658 --> 00:45:47,225
Why not?

742
00:45:47,227 --> 00:45:48,693
How's my little baby, huh?

743
00:45:48,695 --> 00:45:51,346
You be a good baby while daddy's out, okay?

744
00:45:51,348 --> 00:45:53,781
Okay, my sweet Matilda?

745
00:45:53,783 --> 00:45:55,883
Your ass stinks.

746
00:45:55,885 --> 00:45:57,486
What did you say?

747
00:45:57,488 --> 00:45:59,670
Your ass stinks.

748
00:45:59,672 --> 00:46:01,606
That son of a bitch.

749
00:46:01,608 --> 00:46:03,341
Frank!

750
00:46:03,343 --> 00:46:05,610
Frank, where are you going?

751
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:12,550
Yo, big bird.

752
00:46:12,552 --> 00:46:14,753
Lemon boy, Mr. Meringue.

753
00:46:14,755 --> 00:46:16,554
Out the door.

754
00:46:24,063 --> 00:46:26,581
Can I get ahead of you, Toby? I'm kind of in a hurry.

755
00:46:26,583 --> 00:46:29,150
No, Alan. Wait your turn just like everyone else.

756
00:46:31,021 --> 00:46:33,221
Cut it out, Alan.

757
00:46:33,223 --> 00:46:35,557
Alan, behave yourself or I'll have to ask you to leave the line.

758
00:46:35,559 --> 00:46:37,492
Yes, ma'am.

759
00:46:48,805 --> 00:46:51,006
You're so gross, Alan. I'm telling.

760
00:46:58,298 --> 00:47:00,531
Ow!

761
00:47:05,755 --> 00:47:08,056
- What was that for?
- Shooting spitballs at me?

762
00:47:08,058 --> 00:47:10,475
- No.
- You better not be.

763
00:47:19,503 --> 00:47:20,986
Who did that?

764
00:47:31,915 --> 00:47:32,981
I knew it was you.

765
00:47:32,983 --> 00:47:34,249
Oh, way to go, penis lips.

766
00:47:34,251 --> 00:47:35,951
Yeah?

767
00:47:37,621 --> 00:47:40,622
Fuck that shit. You don't want to be messing like that, Alan.

768
00:47:40,624 --> 00:47:42,624
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

769
00:47:42,626 --> 00:47:44,359
- Yeah, I do.
- No, you don't.

770
00:47:44,361 --> 00:47:46,127
Yeah, I do!

771
00:47:51,167 --> 00:47:53,251
Now that's gonna cost you some shit.

772
00:47:53,253 --> 00:47:55,620
I told you to stop picking on me, you fat pig.

773
00:47:55,622 --> 00:47:57,589
You little punk, what did you do to Matilda?

774
00:47:57,591 --> 00:47:58,923
What are you talking about?

775
00:47:58,925 --> 00:48:00,592
You corrupted my bird Matilda.

776
00:48:00,594 --> 00:48:02,527
I didn't do nothing to your fucking bird.

777
00:48:02,529 --> 00:48:04,780
Don't lie, Alan. You just told us all about it.

778
00:48:04,782 --> 00:48:07,465
- Fat fucking liar.
- You watch that mouth of yours.

779
00:48:07,467 --> 00:48:09,234
- Let go of me.
- I'll let go of you.

780
00:48:09,236 --> 00:48:11,570
I'm gonna kick your ass out of this camp so fast

781
00:48:11,572 --> 00:48:13,137
You won't know what hit you.

782
00:48:13,139 --> 00:48:14,506
Let go, you fucking dick.

783
00:48:14,508 --> 00:48:17,726
- You get back here.
- Your ass stinks.

784
00:48:26,336 --> 00:48:28,069
Frank's a real jerk, Isn't he?

785
00:48:28,071 --> 00:48:30,639
Yeah, he really is.

786
00:48:30,641 --> 00:48:33,608
Listen, Alan,

787
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:36,678
Some of the girls and I were playing spin the bottle behind the stage.

788
00:48:36,680 --> 00:48:40,982
And, um, we wanted to know if you want to join us.

789
00:48:40,984 --> 00:48:42,817
Really? You mean it?

790
00:48:42,819 --> 00:48:44,753
Yeah, sure.

791
00:48:44,755 --> 00:48:47,055
Wow, I don't believe it.

792
00:48:47,057 --> 00:48:48,723
Yeah, come on.

793
00:48:48,725 --> 00:48:50,892
Awesome.

794
00:48:54,898 --> 00:48:57,298
Here we are.

795
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,768
How come all the lights are out?

796
00:48:59,770 --> 00:49:03,538
Um, you always play spin the bottle with the lights off.

797
00:49:03,540 --> 00:49:05,139
Oh.

798
00:49:05,141 --> 00:49:06,875
Come in.

799
00:49:08,879 --> 00:49:10,278
Shut the door, Alan.

800
00:49:19,857 --> 00:49:21,857
Hey, where's everybody else?

801
00:49:21,859 --> 00:49:25,193
Don't worry. They'll be here.

802
00:49:27,180 --> 00:49:29,898
Karen?

803
00:49:29,900 --> 00:49:32,100
Karen, you there?

804
00:49:32,102 --> 00:49:34,268
Right here, Alan.

805
00:49:34,270 --> 00:49:35,637
Just getting a flashlight.

806
00:49:35,639 --> 00:49:38,139
Oh, okay.

807
00:49:38,141 --> 00:49:41,376
Hey! Hey, stop!

808
00:49:46,767 --> 00:49:49,667
Let go! Let me go!

809
00:50:07,103 --> 00:50:09,621
What's going on?

810
00:50:23,486 --> 00:50:25,420
What are you doing?

811
00:50:25,422 --> 00:50:27,405
What's happening?

812
00:50:33,430 --> 00:50:36,114
Get away from him, god damn you.

813
00:50:37,717 --> 00:50:39,917
You're all monsters.

814
00:50:39,919 --> 00:50:42,086
Get those lights on.

815
00:50:42,088 --> 00:50:44,005
Turn the lights on now.

816
00:50:44,007 --> 00:50:46,290
I want to know who did this.

817
00:50:46,292 --> 00:50:47,525
I want to know right now.

818
00:50:47,527 --> 00:50:49,394
What do you want from me? It's my night off.

819
00:50:49,396 --> 00:50:51,696
Not anymore it's not. Now find out.

820
00:50:51,698 --> 00:50:53,831
Okay okay. Jesus.

821
00:51:08,281 --> 00:51:10,148
I think he's finally asleep.

822
00:51:15,438 --> 00:51:17,338
You okay, Ronnie?

823
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:19,991
You know, it's funny, Petey.

824
00:51:19,993 --> 00:51:23,928
Every time Alan gets in any trouble, you're always there.

825
00:51:23,930 --> 00:51:26,147
What's that supposed to mean?

826
00:51:26,149 --> 00:51:28,066
- Who are you?
- Ronnie.

827
00:51:28,068 --> 00:51:31,068
Who are you really? Where do you come from, huh?

828
00:51:31,070 --> 00:51:34,172
- Ronnie, you're scaring me.
- Every single time Alan gets in trouble,

829
00:51:34,174 --> 00:51:36,240
There you are, johnny on the spot.

830
00:51:36,242 --> 00:51:38,509
Why is that, Petey? Huh? Why?

831
00:51:38,511 --> 00:51:40,378
What are you talking about?

832
00:51:40,380 --> 00:51:42,029
Oh, you know what I'm talking about...

833
00:51:42,031 --> 00:51:43,531
Peter.

834
00:51:43,533 --> 00:51:47,035
No, wait. It's not Peter, is it?

835
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:49,504
No, it's Angela!

836
00:51:49,506 --> 00:51:52,189
- Ronnie, stop it.
- I'll stop it.

837
00:51:52,191 --> 00:51:54,325
I'm gonna put a stop to it right now.

838
00:51:54,327 --> 00:51:57,445
- Ronnie.
- We have to do something before it's too late

839
00:51:57,447 --> 00:51:59,247
Before she kills someone else.

840
00:52:00,617 --> 00:52:02,467
Take it easy now, Ron.

841
00:52:02,469 --> 00:52:04,135
It's her, sheriff, I know it is.

842
00:52:04,137 --> 00:52:05,903
I can feel it. She's here.

843
00:52:05,905 --> 00:52:08,156
Who's here? And what the hell is this?

844
00:52:08,158 --> 00:52:10,808
Angela, Frank. Angela, she's here.

845
00:52:10,810 --> 00:52:13,895
I told you, enough of that crap. There is no Angela.

846
00:52:13,897 --> 00:52:16,097
Yes, there is. It's her.

847
00:52:16,099 --> 00:52:19,049
Oh yeah? Why don't you just go back to your cabin now?

848
00:52:19,051 --> 00:52:21,719
Honestly, Frank, I don't know what he's talking about.

849
00:52:21,721 --> 00:52:23,288
Go!

850
00:52:25,625 --> 00:52:27,225
There's something going on out there.

851
00:52:27,227 --> 00:52:29,727
Now what?

852
00:52:29,729 --> 00:52:32,947
Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob...

853
00:52:32,949 --> 00:52:36,183
You kids better stop that noise and return to your bunks.

854
00:52:36,185 --> 00:52:39,170
Blowjob, blowjob, blowjob...

855
00:52:44,093 --> 00:52:45,643
I'm telling you for the last time.

856
00:52:45,645 --> 00:52:47,778
Stop that noise immediately.

857
00:52:50,917 --> 00:52:52,550
Guys.

858
00:52:52,552 --> 00:52:54,435
Stop it. Shut up.

859
00:52:54,437 --> 00:52:56,971
Shh, quiet, Alan. Go back to sleep.

860
00:52:56,973 --> 00:52:59,523
Okay, that's it.

861
00:52:59,525 --> 00:53:02,559
You're all confined to your bunks for the rest of the week.

862
00:53:05,882 --> 00:53:09,267
Stop calling me that.
Stop calling me that!

863
00:53:09,269 --> 00:53:10,701
Take it easy, Alan.

864
00:53:15,108 --> 00:53:16,824
Tell them to stop.
Tell them to stop.

865
00:53:16,826 --> 00:53:18,826
- Calm down, Alan.
- Tell them to shut up.

866
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:20,327
Tell them to shut the fuck up!

867
00:53:20,329 --> 00:53:21,863
I told you to watch your mouth.

868
00:53:21,865 --> 00:53:23,998
Get away from me!

869
00:53:24,000 --> 00:53:25,700
Little bastard.

870
00:53:28,321 --> 00:53:30,688
Shut up!
Shut up!

871
00:53:41,835 --> 00:53:43,734
Alan!
Alan!

872
00:53:43,736 --> 00:53:46,120
What are you worried about? Where's he gonna go?

873
00:53:46,122 --> 00:53:48,672
- The boy is sick, Frank.
- Yeah, he's sick alright.

874
00:53:48,674 --> 00:53:50,725
And now I'm starting to wonder about you.

875
00:53:50,727 --> 00:53:52,910
Alan!

876
00:53:57,617 --> 00:53:59,783
You boys are all in trouble.

877
00:54:11,030 --> 00:54:13,164
So did you find the little monster?

878
00:54:13,166 --> 00:54:15,332
No. No sign of him anywhere.

879
00:54:15,334 --> 00:54:18,786
I'm worried, Frank. You saw his condition before he ran off.

880
00:54:18,788 --> 00:54:22,556
Listen, I've been in this business a long time,

881
00:54:22,558 --> 00:54:26,194
And believe me, I've seen much worse tantrums than that.

882
00:54:26,196 --> 00:54:27,661
Trust me, he's around.

883
00:54:27,663 --> 00:54:30,548
I just hope we find him soon.

884
00:54:30,550 --> 00:54:33,234
I'm gonna make a sandwich. You want something?

885
00:54:33,236 --> 00:54:35,203
No, I'm gonna keep on looking for Alan.

886
00:54:35,205 --> 00:54:38,056
Well, you just keep me posted.

887
00:54:38,058 --> 00:54:39,924
Yeah.

888
00:55:01,331 --> 00:55:02,780
Matilda.

889
00:55:39,602 --> 00:55:41,552
That damn light's killing me.

890
00:55:46,976 --> 00:55:48,542
Get me out of this thing.

891
00:55:48,544 --> 00:55:50,978
What is this, a joke?

892
00:55:50,980 --> 00:55:52,964
Untie me.

893
00:55:52,966 --> 00:55:55,183
Get this--

894
00:55:57,520 --> 00:55:59,136
What are you doing?

895
00:56:01,107 --> 00:56:02,874
What the hell is going on here?

896
00:56:04,193 --> 00:56:06,344
Ah, my neck.

897
00:56:07,597 --> 00:56:09,330
Get me out of this!

898
00:56:11,250 --> 00:56:13,116
What the hell's going on?

899
00:56:15,221 --> 00:56:16,804
Keep it away.
No.

900
00:56:30,470 --> 00:56:33,287
This is bad. This is so bad.

901
00:56:33,289 --> 00:56:36,106
I don't understand why you're freaking out, Karen.

902
00:56:36,108 --> 00:56:38,442
Did you see the look on his face? He's crazy, Marie.

903
00:56:38,444 --> 00:56:40,328
You remember what he did with those frogs.

904
00:56:40,330 --> 00:56:42,046
Come on, Marie.

905
00:56:42,048 --> 00:56:45,199
Don't you see what you're doing?
Shit.

906
00:56:45,201 --> 00:56:47,251
Stop bouncing around so much.

907
00:56:47,253 --> 00:56:49,787
Chill out, Bella.

908
00:56:49,789 --> 00:56:51,723
I was the one that lured him here.

909
00:56:51,725 --> 00:56:54,108
Oh stop it. It was just a joke.

910
00:56:54,110 --> 00:56:56,410
That wasn't a joke. That was cruel.

911
00:56:56,412 --> 00:56:57,795
Yeah, whatever.

912
00:56:57,797 --> 00:57:00,381
Hey, you guys want to go back down to the rec hall?

913
00:57:00,383 --> 00:57:03,668
All this excitement has got me jonesing for some ice cream.

914
00:57:03,670 --> 00:57:05,352
Like she needed an excuse.

915
00:57:05,354 --> 00:57:07,054
You dissing me, four eyes?

916
00:57:09,025 --> 00:57:11,075
Come on, Karen, my treat.

917
00:57:11,077 --> 00:57:13,227
No, i don't think so.

918
00:57:13,229 --> 00:57:15,329
Well, I'm not going, if you're not going.

919
00:57:15,331 --> 00:57:16,514
Me neither.

920
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,898
What about you, Bella?

921
00:57:17,900 --> 00:57:20,234
Fuck that shit. Take a look at that ass, girls,

922
00:57:20,236 --> 00:57:22,703
'Cause that's the last thing you're gonna be looking at

923
00:57:22,705 --> 00:57:24,205
As i walk through that door.

924
00:57:32,882 --> 00:57:35,650
Oh, alright.

925
00:57:38,288 --> 00:57:40,254
Please, Miss Karen.

926
00:57:40,256 --> 00:57:42,856
Don't you want to go back down to the canteen with us?

927
00:57:42,858 --> 00:57:44,625
Pretty please.

928
00:57:44,627 --> 00:57:46,093
Sure.
Okay.

929
00:57:46,095 --> 00:57:48,062
Alright, let's get the fuck out of here.

930
00:58:05,048 --> 00:58:06,480
T.C., what are you doing?

931
00:58:06,482 --> 00:58:09,266
Scoping tits and choking the weasel.

932
00:58:09,268 --> 00:58:10,835
Well, get your ass up, boy.

933
00:58:10,837 --> 00:58:13,587
Yeah, man, we're going on a panty raid at the younger girls' bunk.

934
00:58:13,589 --> 00:58:16,707
Forget it, guys. Ronnie grounded me for the rest of the summer.

935
00:58:16,709 --> 00:58:18,942
Yeah, like he'll even know.

936
00:58:18,944 --> 00:58:21,378
He said he's gonna check on me every 15 minutes.

937
00:58:21,380 --> 00:58:25,149
And how many times has he checked on you so far tonight?

938
00:58:25,151 --> 00:58:26,334
None.

939
00:58:26,336 --> 00:58:28,219
And how big a pussy are you

940
00:58:28,221 --> 00:58:30,338
For even thinking about what he said to you?

941
00:58:30,340 --> 00:58:32,323
Alright.

942
00:58:32,325 --> 00:58:34,158
You convinced me.

943
00:58:34,160 --> 00:58:36,393
Attaboy.

944
00:58:39,532 --> 00:58:43,501
T.C., get your butt back in that cabin now!

945
00:58:43,503 --> 00:58:45,286
Oh, busted big time.

946
00:58:45,288 --> 00:58:46,821
Give the boys my regards.

947
00:58:46,823 --> 00:58:48,656
Sorry, man. Later.

948
00:59:08,244 --> 00:59:09,727
Jesus christ, Linda.

949
00:59:09,729 --> 00:59:11,261
I think you gave me whiplash.

950
00:59:11,263 --> 00:59:13,397
That was fun. Was that four-wheel drive?

951
00:59:13,399 --> 00:59:15,582
No, you got to push the second stick down there.

952
00:59:15,584 --> 00:59:17,518
How about the third stick?

953
00:59:27,780 --> 00:59:30,181
That's kind of weird.

954
00:59:32,017 --> 00:59:33,950
- What the hell is that?
- It's the Pumps.

955
00:59:33,952 --> 00:59:36,187
They Pump the water from the lake to the camp.

956
00:59:36,189 --> 00:59:38,522
So that's why they call it the Pump house.

957
00:59:38,524 --> 00:59:41,692
Oh no. This is why they call it the Pump house.

958
00:59:41,694 --> 00:59:43,527
Oh, real cute, Randy.

959
00:59:48,151 --> 00:59:50,784
- Do you hear something?
- I told you, it's the Pumps.

960
00:59:50,786 --> 00:59:52,519
No it's not, moron. Listen.

961
00:59:52,521 --> 00:59:54,221
It's in the woods.

962
00:59:54,223 --> 00:59:56,840
How can you hear anything over those freakin' Pumps?

963
00:59:56,842 --> 00:59:59,710
Come on, let's go.

964
00:59:59,712 --> 01:00:03,080
- The Pump house is waiting.
- Stop doing that.

965
01:00:04,349 --> 01:00:07,217
Oh, randy, you take me to the nicest places.

966
01:00:07,219 --> 01:00:08,953
Only the best for you, darling.

967
01:00:08,955 --> 01:00:10,387
Yeah.

968
01:00:22,651 --> 01:00:24,468
Slow down, lover.

969
01:00:27,206 --> 01:00:29,206
- Did you hear that?
- What now?

970
01:00:29,208 --> 01:00:31,609
That noise. Listen, it--

971
01:00:31,611 --> 01:00:34,544
It sounds like someone's messing around by the Pump house.

972
01:00:36,649 --> 01:00:39,216
Oh my god, run. It's the cropsey maniac!

973
01:00:42,688 --> 01:00:44,688
You're such an asshole.

974
01:00:44,690 --> 01:00:46,673
Yeah, but you want me anyway, don't you?

975
01:00:46,675 --> 01:00:49,627
So why don't you come over here and give me some of that lovin'?

976
01:00:49,629 --> 01:00:52,213
I'm coming.

977
01:00:59,439 --> 01:01:01,439
Did you bring the sleeping bag?

978
01:01:01,441 --> 01:01:03,874
- Yeah, it's in the jeep.
- Yeah?

979
01:01:03,876 --> 01:01:05,276
Yeah, what?

980
01:01:05,278 --> 01:01:06,777
Yeah, go get it.

981
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:09,380
Could you go get it, Lin? I gotta take a little winkie.

982
01:01:09,382 --> 01:01:11,382
That's real romantic, Randy.

983
01:01:11,384 --> 01:01:13,384
Come on, babe, It's only up the hill.

984
01:01:13,386 --> 01:01:15,786
- You're a real gentleman.
- Thanks, Lin.

985
01:01:15,788 --> 01:01:18,572
Hey, Lin, grab the beers, would you?

986
01:01:21,844 --> 01:01:24,060
Hurry up. I don't want you to see me.

987
01:01:24,062 --> 01:01:26,530
I think the mood's already ruined.

988
01:01:33,256 --> 01:01:35,522
Oh, that's what I'm talking about.

989
01:01:38,227 --> 01:01:39,910
Wait.

990
01:01:39,912 --> 01:01:41,995
Hey, I'm trying to pee here.

991
01:01:43,616 --> 01:01:45,282
Hey, you want to loosen it up a little?

992
01:01:45,284 --> 01:01:46,834
I gotta breathe, you know.

993
01:01:47,720 --> 01:01:49,803
Oh, fuck, that hurt.

994
01:01:49,805 --> 01:01:52,639
Take it easy, would you?

995
01:01:55,762 --> 01:01:59,697
Well well well, what do we have here?

996
01:01:59,699 --> 01:02:01,699
What, are we hanging some mice tonight?

997
01:02:05,204 --> 01:02:09,540
Hello? Earth to Lin, are you receiving me?

998
01:02:09,542 --> 01:02:13,244
Feeling a little kinky tonight, aren't we, Linda?

999
01:02:14,747 --> 01:02:17,481
Easy there. Them's the family jewels.

1000
01:02:20,603 --> 01:02:22,770
Hey, loosen it up, will you? It's too tight.

1001
01:02:22,772 --> 01:02:24,922
Linda, Linda, I'm not kidding.

1002
01:02:24,924 --> 01:02:26,523
It's too tight. It fucking hurts.

1003
01:02:30,112 --> 01:02:32,613
Hey, look, now I'm starting to lose the mood.

1004
01:02:33,599 --> 01:02:36,517
Linda?

1005
01:02:36,519 --> 01:02:38,319
Linda, you're choking Mr. Happy.

1006
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,789
Alright, alright, this joke's played out.

1007
01:02:42,791 --> 01:02:44,458
Get this stuff off me, will you, Eh?

1008
01:02:44,460 --> 01:02:45,993
So we can all have some fun.

1009
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:48,629
Linda? Linda, god damn it,

1010
01:02:48,631 --> 01:02:50,714
I can't fucking breathe.

1011
01:02:50,716 --> 01:02:53,951
And you're hurting my fucking pecker.

1012
01:02:53,953 --> 01:02:56,153
Linda.

1013
01:02:56,155 --> 01:02:57,854
Aw, Linda.

1014
01:03:04,463 --> 01:03:06,463
Linda, where are you?

1015
01:03:09,368 --> 01:03:11,302
Randy.

1016
01:03:11,304 --> 01:03:13,654
Linda.  Linda.

1017
01:03:13,656 --> 01:03:15,088
Linda.

1018
01:03:15,090 --> 01:03:17,141
Randy, are you calling me?

1019
01:03:23,933 --> 01:03:26,934
Linda.

1020
01:03:26,936 --> 01:03:29,970
Linda, where are you?

1021
01:03:29,972 --> 01:03:32,322
Linda.

1022
01:03:35,260 --> 01:03:36,960
Linda.

1023
01:03:38,196 --> 01:03:40,363
Shit.

1024
01:03:40,365 --> 01:03:42,933
Who the fuck is doing this to me?

1025
01:03:44,320 --> 01:03:46,270
Randy?

1026
01:03:46,272 --> 01:03:48,188
Is everything alright?

1027
01:03:48,190 --> 01:03:51,242
Linda? Linda.

1028
01:03:51,244 --> 01:03:53,977
If that's you then who the fuck--?

1029
01:03:55,398 --> 01:03:58,131
Alan?

1030
01:03:58,133 --> 01:04:00,484
Alan, is that you?

1031
01:04:02,438 --> 01:04:05,355
Alan, listen, buddy,

1032
01:04:05,357 --> 01:04:08,859
I was only kidding with you, mate.

1033
01:04:08,861 --> 01:04:11,594
I was just having a bit of fun, you know?

1034
01:04:11,596 --> 01:04:14,331
Come on, Alan, cut me loose, Eh?

1035
01:04:15,317 --> 01:04:17,367
Alan, God damn it, get me down!

1036
01:04:19,104 --> 01:04:20,737
Hey!

1037
01:04:20,739 --> 01:04:22,640
Hey, where are you going?

1038
01:04:22,642 --> 01:04:25,159
Alan, look, I'm sorry.

1039
01:04:25,161 --> 01:04:29,530
I didn't mean to be so mean to you.

1040
01:04:29,532 --> 01:04:31,532
Look, I know it sounds stupid,

1041
01:04:31,534 --> 01:04:33,967
But if you don't cut me loose,

1042
01:04:33,969 --> 01:04:36,503
I will fucking kill you!

1043
01:04:36,505 --> 01:04:38,839
Alan, get back here now!

1044
01:04:38,841 --> 01:04:42,242
Oh, shit, he's coming after me.

1045
01:04:42,244 --> 01:04:44,678
Alan, where are you?

1046
01:04:47,599 --> 01:04:49,966
Linda, get down here!

1047
01:04:53,573 --> 01:04:56,456
Oh, shit. Oh, please please start.

1048
01:04:59,161 --> 01:05:01,161
Come on, motherfucker.

1049
01:05:01,163 --> 01:05:03,797
I can't believe this.

1050
01:05:03,799 --> 01:05:06,149
Piece of shit, move!

1051
01:05:06,151 --> 01:05:07,968
Fuck!

1052
01:05:09,105 --> 01:05:11,055
Motherfucker.

1053
01:05:11,057 --> 01:05:13,107
Damn it!

1054
01:05:13,109 --> 01:05:16,527
Fucking go! Oh my god.

1055
01:05:16,529 --> 01:05:19,946
Yes.  Yes. Thank you, god.

1056
01:05:19,948 --> 01:05:22,633
Alan, you little fucking bast--

1057
01:05:23,969 --> 01:05:25,402
Oh no.

1058
01:05:28,924 --> 01:05:30,574
Oh, shit.

1059
01:05:32,761 --> 01:05:34,628
Whoa whoa whoa.

1060
01:05:39,485 --> 01:05:41,385
- Argh!
- Fuck!

1061
01:05:47,009 --> 01:05:49,325
Oh, fuck.

1062
01:05:51,780 --> 01:05:53,363
Come on, motherfucker.

1063
01:06:03,775 --> 01:06:06,510
Stupid piece of shit, fucking move!

1064
01:06:06,512 --> 01:06:08,028
Fuck!

1065
01:06:12,301 --> 01:06:14,201
Oh, thank you, god.

1066
01:06:15,438 --> 01:06:18,689
Fuck. Fuck.

1067
01:06:18,691 --> 01:06:20,190
Come on.

1068
01:06:21,610 --> 01:06:23,693
Four-wheel drive.

1069
01:06:23,695 --> 01:06:26,446
You're not gonna get me, you little fucker!

1070
01:06:44,817 --> 01:06:47,151
What the hell is that?

1071
01:06:50,272 --> 01:06:51,955
Holy fuck!

1072
01:07:41,340 --> 01:07:43,240
Whoa!

1073
01:07:45,661 --> 01:07:46,994
What the fuck?

1074
01:07:53,202 --> 01:07:56,303
You missed it, man. What a freakin' pisser.

1075
01:07:56,305 --> 01:07:58,138
I must have got 20 panties.

1076
01:07:58,140 --> 01:08:00,607
You know, Spaz, a fucking broomstick just came through the floor

1077
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:02,475
And almost hit me in the fucking head.

1078
01:08:02,477 --> 01:08:04,244
Look what it did to Donny's porn.

1079
01:08:04,246 --> 01:08:07,830
You sure it wasn't just you popping some major wood?

1080
01:08:07,832 --> 01:08:09,816
Don't be a dick, Spaz.

1081
01:08:09,818 --> 01:08:12,135
Look, there it is.

1082
01:08:12,137 --> 01:08:14,321
- Come here and check it out.
- Alright.

1083
01:08:18,093 --> 01:08:20,910
Yeah, I see it. So what?

1084
01:08:20,912 --> 01:08:22,679
Are you kidding? Look at it.

1085
01:08:22,681 --> 01:08:25,415
It's as sharp as a fucking spike.

1086
01:08:27,269 --> 01:08:29,102
Maybe.

1087
01:08:29,104 --> 01:08:30,904
I can't tell. It's too dark down there.

1088
01:08:30,906 --> 01:08:32,789
What are you talking about?

1089
01:08:32,791 --> 01:08:34,440
I can see it perfect.

1090
01:08:59,851 --> 01:09:03,103
It's not like Frank not to answer his phone. He always picks up.

1091
01:09:03,105 --> 01:09:05,456
Oh my god.

1092
01:09:05,458 --> 01:09:08,325
- Matilda?
- Shouldn't she be in a cage or something?

1093
01:09:08,327 --> 01:09:11,311
Yeah, Frank would never allow her out like this.

1094
01:09:13,315 --> 01:09:15,215
Your ass stinks.

1095
01:09:15,217 --> 01:09:18,085
Isn't that what Alan always says?

1096
01:09:18,087 --> 01:09:20,787
Your ass stinks.

1097
01:09:20,789 --> 01:09:22,589
Frank!

1098
01:09:23,926 --> 01:09:26,026
Frank, Frank, Are you okay?

1099
01:09:28,280 --> 01:09:29,863
Oh my god.

1100
01:09:36,572 --> 01:09:39,272
It's started again.

1101
01:09:57,510 --> 01:10:00,510
Who's been messing with my shit?

1102
01:10:00,512 --> 01:10:02,545
They're always messing with my shit.

1103
01:10:02,547 --> 01:10:04,848
I swear they need to get their own stuff.

1104
01:10:04,850 --> 01:10:08,251
They get on my nerves.

1105
01:10:08,253 --> 01:10:10,220
Dang.

1106
01:10:12,507 --> 01:10:14,558
I hate that shit.

1107
01:10:19,097 --> 01:10:21,998
Getting on my nerves. Dang.

1108
01:10:22,000 --> 01:10:24,134
Always bothering me.

1109
01:10:24,136 --> 01:10:26,203
I swear I hate this place.

1110
01:10:32,077 --> 01:10:33,827
Motherfucker.

1111
01:10:35,263 --> 01:10:36,513
What the fuck?

1112
01:10:58,070 --> 01:11:00,003
Ronnie, Ronnie, where are you going?

1113
01:11:00,005 --> 01:11:02,305
I'm gonna put an end to this before it goes any further.

1114
01:11:02,307 --> 01:11:04,641
- What are you talking about?
- She's back, Jenny.

1115
01:11:04,643 --> 01:11:06,476
That evil little witch is back.

1116
01:11:06,478 --> 01:11:09,880
- Who?
- Angela.

1117
01:11:09,882 --> 01:11:11,682
So why don't we wander down to the waterfront,

1118
01:11:11,684 --> 01:11:13,183
Watch the submarine races?

1119
01:11:13,185 --> 01:11:15,485
The submarine races? Are you kidding me?

1120
01:11:15,487 --> 01:11:17,521
- Did you hear?
- Hear what?

1121
01:11:17,523 --> 01:11:20,490
- Somebody just killed T.C.
- Get the fuck out of here.

1122
01:11:20,492 --> 01:11:22,242
No, really, they stuck a spear right through his head.

1123
01:11:22,244 --> 01:11:24,093
Man, It's unbelievable.

1124
01:11:24,095 --> 01:11:26,396
What, you believe this crap?

1125
01:11:26,398 --> 01:11:28,431
I have to go.

1126
01:11:28,433 --> 01:11:31,401
Karen, It's bullshit.

1127
01:11:31,403 --> 01:11:33,169
He's just dicking with us.

1128
01:11:33,171 --> 01:11:34,921
Karen.

1129
01:11:36,425 --> 01:11:39,008
Why are they making us go back so early?

1130
01:11:39,010 --> 01:11:41,077
They're probably doing something lame like breaking color war.

1131
01:11:41,079 --> 01:11:43,480
Oh, yeah, i bet that's it.

1132
01:11:43,482 --> 01:11:45,482
Somebody killed T.C.

1133
01:11:45,484 --> 01:11:47,800
Yeah, okay, Karen, that's so not funny.

1134
01:11:47,802 --> 01:11:50,386
Seriously. Alright, Maria, I gotta go.

1135
01:11:50,388 --> 01:11:53,256
Good night, Trace. That's not very funny, Karen.

1136
01:11:53,258 --> 01:11:55,291
I thought you said you were gonna chill.

1137
01:11:56,461 --> 01:11:58,795
Oh my god.

1138
01:11:58,797 --> 01:12:01,164
Oh, god.

1139
01:12:04,670 --> 01:12:07,271
Oh, god.

1140
01:12:07,273 --> 01:12:10,674
It's Alan. Alan did this.

1141
01:12:10,676 --> 01:12:13,426
I warned you about him, but you didn't believe me!

1142
01:12:20,419 --> 01:12:22,419
And he's gonna kill me next.

1143
01:12:22,421 --> 01:12:25,522
Karen, stop. Stop talking like that.

1144
01:12:25,524 --> 01:12:28,658
I'm next! He's coming after me next!

1145
01:12:28,660 --> 01:12:30,026
Karen!

1146
01:12:34,833 --> 01:12:36,966
Karen!

1147
01:12:51,767 --> 01:12:54,167
Nobody's leaving here till I find out where she is.

1148
01:12:54,169 --> 01:12:55,902
You're talking crazy, Ronnie.

1149
01:12:55,904 --> 01:12:57,788
I know Petey. You're way off base.

1150
01:12:57,790 --> 01:12:59,723
Oh, yeah? Maybe you're in on this too.

1151
01:12:59,725 --> 01:13:03,410
Ronnie, He-- He killed Bella.

1152
01:13:03,412 --> 01:13:05,412
- What?
- Bella-- She's dead.

1153
01:13:05,414 --> 01:13:07,246
- What's happening here?
- I keep telling you,

1154
01:13:07,248 --> 01:13:09,032
Angela's here. She's killing again.

1155
01:13:09,034 --> 01:13:11,401
There's no Angela, Ronnie. It was her brother Peter

1156
01:13:11,403 --> 01:13:13,136
And he's in custody upstate.

1157
01:13:13,138 --> 01:13:16,139
The killer isn't this Angela that you keep talking about. It's Alan.

1158
01:13:16,141 --> 01:13:19,176
Karen said Alan killed Bella and he's gonna get her next.

1159
01:13:19,178 --> 01:13:21,178
And he's already killed Frank and T.C.

1160
01:13:21,180 --> 01:13:24,815
- Hey, what's all the fuss?
- Alan killed Frank, T.C. And Bella.

1161
01:13:24,817 --> 01:13:26,349
- What?
- Stop saying that.

1162
01:13:26,351 --> 01:13:28,518
Karen thinks she's next and she ran away.

1163
01:13:28,520 --> 01:13:31,621
- We have to go find her.
- Nobody's going anywhere.

1164
01:13:31,623 --> 01:13:34,640
Bullshit.  I'm gonna stop this psycho right now.

1165
01:13:34,642 --> 01:13:35,925
You see what you guys are doing?

1166
01:13:35,927 --> 01:13:37,877
Now everybody get to your cabins, please.

1167
01:13:37,879 --> 01:13:39,896
Come on, Marie.

1168
01:13:42,434 --> 01:13:44,952
Well, here I am.

1169
01:13:44,954 --> 01:13:46,486
Is that Ricky?

1170
01:13:46,488 --> 01:13:48,956
Ronnie, what the hell are you doing here?

1171
01:13:48,958 --> 01:13:50,958
I was gonna ask you the same thing.

1172
01:13:50,960 --> 01:13:52,993
Barney Fife told me to come here.

1173
01:13:52,995 --> 01:13:54,927
I haven't spoken to you since we met last week.

1174
01:13:54,929 --> 01:13:57,830
What are you talking about? You just called me an hour ago.

1175
01:13:57,832 --> 01:13:59,716
Looks like somebody wants you here.

1176
01:13:59,718 --> 01:14:01,618
The only one who'd want him here is Angela.

1177
01:14:01,620 --> 01:14:02,969
Just stop that.

1178
01:14:02,971 --> 01:14:05,154
- Then why is he here?
- We're wasting time.

1179
01:14:05,156 --> 01:14:07,757
There's a killer out there with Karen and Michael.

1180
01:14:07,759 --> 01:14:09,375
Whoa, what the fuck is she talking about?

1181
01:14:09,377 --> 01:14:11,377
It's happened again, Ricky. Angela's back

1182
01:14:11,379 --> 01:14:13,212
And she's killed three people already.

1183
01:14:13,214 --> 01:14:15,064
- What?
- We have to find those kids.

1184
01:14:15,066 --> 01:14:17,701
She's right. I'll take the upper camp, you guys take the lower.

1185
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:19,969
- Ronnie.
- Alright, let me get some flashlights.

1186
01:14:27,679 --> 01:14:29,679
You'd better keep an eye on Ricky.

1187
01:14:29,681 --> 01:14:31,648
Don't worry, I will.

1188
01:14:57,825 --> 01:15:00,176
Is anybody there?

1189
01:15:00,178 --> 01:15:01,661
Hello?

1190
01:15:04,499 --> 01:15:07,500
Linda, Linda, is that you?

1191
01:15:07,502 --> 01:15:09,669
Linda, help me.

1192
01:15:28,056 --> 01:15:29,456
Oh, god.

1193
01:15:33,462 --> 01:15:35,228
No!

1194
01:15:44,990 --> 01:15:47,123
- Michael.
- Did you find Karen yet?

1195
01:15:47,125 --> 01:15:50,126
- Michael, it's too dangerous for you to be out here.
- Did you find her?

1196
01:15:50,128 --> 01:15:51,828
- No, not yet.
- What about Alan?

1197
01:15:51,830 --> 01:15:53,296
- Nothing.
- Fuck.

1198
01:15:53,298 --> 01:15:55,665
- Michael.
- Who's the nut?

1199
01:15:55,667 --> 01:15:58,518
- It's Alan's brother.
- Is he a suspect too or am I the only one?

1200
01:15:58,520 --> 01:16:00,353
- Hey, nobody's saying--
- Bullshit.

1201
01:16:00,355 --> 01:16:02,889
I'm just sticking around to prove all you assholes wrong.

1202
01:16:04,526 --> 01:16:06,059
Come on.

1203
01:16:41,747 --> 01:16:43,145
Who's there?

1204
01:16:46,902 --> 01:16:48,317
Where am I?

1205
01:16:48,319 --> 01:16:50,687
What's going on?

1206
01:16:52,040 --> 01:16:54,507
Who's there?

1207
01:16:57,529 --> 01:16:59,829
Wh-- What?

1208
01:17:02,050 --> 01:17:04,918
What's going on?

1209
01:17:04,920 --> 01:17:07,804
Alan?

1210
01:17:07,806 --> 01:17:10,089
What--?

1211
01:17:10,091 --> 01:17:12,792
Alan.
Alan.

1212
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:14,460
Alan, what are you doing?

1213
01:17:16,214 --> 01:17:17,781
Stop!

1214
01:17:19,016 --> 01:17:20,783
Alan, stop.

1215
01:17:22,621 --> 01:17:25,038
Alan, Alan, please.

1216
01:17:25,040 --> 01:17:26,806
What are you doing?

1217
01:17:27,676 --> 01:17:29,559
Alan.

1218
01:17:31,429 --> 01:17:33,896
Alan, please stop.

1219
01:17:33,898 --> 01:17:37,149
Alan! Somebody help me!

1220
01:17:37,151 --> 01:17:38,735
Alan, I'm sorry.

1221
01:17:39,688 --> 01:17:42,071
Alan, I'm sorry.

1222
01:17:42,073 --> 01:17:45,074
I'm sorry, Alan.

1223
01:17:45,076 --> 01:17:47,443
- Karen?
- Alan, stop!

1224
01:17:47,445 --> 01:17:49,228
- Karen.
- Stop!

1225
01:17:52,017 --> 01:17:53,800
- Alan.
- It's alright. He's gone.

1226
01:17:56,921 --> 01:17:58,621
What's going on in here?

1227
01:17:58,623 --> 01:18:00,556
Lower the net!

1228
01:18:05,496 --> 01:18:08,298
Get it off. Get it off.

1229
01:18:08,300 --> 01:18:12,568
Get it off. Get it off.

1230
01:18:12,570 --> 01:18:15,171
Get it off.

1231
01:18:15,173 --> 01:18:18,941
Get it off. Get it off.

1232
01:18:18,943 --> 01:18:22,812
Get it off. Get it off.

1233
01:18:22,814 --> 01:18:24,814
Get it off. Get it off.

1234
01:18:24,816 --> 01:18:26,816
Alan. It was Alan.

1235
01:18:26,818 --> 01:18:28,484
That's it.

1236
01:18:31,723 --> 01:18:34,490
I'm gonna take care of him right now.

1237
01:18:34,492 --> 01:18:36,342
It was Alan.

1238
01:18:38,212 --> 01:18:39,678
It was Alan.

1239
01:18:39,680 --> 01:18:42,449
Shh. Shh.

1240
01:18:45,704 --> 01:18:48,771
They're all so mean.

1241
01:18:48,773 --> 01:18:51,007
Why can't they leave me alone?

1242
01:18:51,009 --> 01:18:53,109
Why why why?

1243
01:18:54,779 --> 01:18:58,081
Michael, please, Michael,

1244
01:18:58,083 --> 01:19:01,484
Don't you start picking on me, please.

1245
01:19:01,486 --> 01:19:03,486
You're very bad, Alan.

1246
01:19:03,488 --> 01:19:05,855
You've always been very bad.

1247
01:19:05,857 --> 01:19:07,206
No, Michael.

1248
01:19:07,208 --> 01:19:10,492
I will not let you hurt Karen.

1249
01:19:10,494 --> 01:19:12,812
What about Karen?

1250
01:19:12,814 --> 01:19:15,548
I know what you did to T.C. and Bella.

1251
01:19:15,550 --> 01:19:17,383
What are you talking about?

1252
01:19:17,385 --> 01:19:20,069
You're a mean, sick-- You're a monster, Alan.

1253
01:19:20,071 --> 01:19:22,037
- I'm not sick.
- Oh, yes, you are.

1254
01:19:25,527 --> 01:19:27,960
Stop it, Michael.

1255
01:19:27,962 --> 01:19:29,261
I'm stopping you, Alan.

1256
01:19:29,263 --> 01:19:31,313
I'm stopping you right now!

1257
01:19:31,315 --> 01:19:33,215
Stop, please.

1258
01:19:33,217 --> 01:19:35,035
No more lying.

1259
01:19:35,037 --> 01:19:38,455
No more lies!

1260
01:19:38,457 --> 01:19:40,924
No more lying!

1261
01:19:45,063 --> 01:19:47,496
Michael, can you hear me?

1262
01:19:47,498 --> 01:19:49,766
- Karen, Michael, are you out here?
- Where are you?

1263
01:19:49,768 --> 01:19:51,033
Shut up.

1264
01:19:51,035 --> 01:19:53,035
You hear something?

1265
01:19:53,037 --> 01:19:55,371
I don't know.

1266
01:20:03,214 --> 01:20:05,698
It's Alan.

1267
01:20:07,786 --> 01:20:10,052
Alan. Come on, Alan.

1268
01:20:10,054 --> 01:20:11,571
I need for you to wake up.

1269
01:20:11,573 --> 01:20:13,356
Who did this to you?

1270
01:20:16,761 --> 01:20:18,360
What?

1271
01:20:22,033 --> 01:20:23,666
What is it?

1272
01:20:23,668 --> 01:20:25,802
- Michael.
- Michael?

1273
01:20:32,327 --> 01:20:34,961
They never learn, do they?

1274
01:20:34,963 --> 01:20:38,614
They have to be so mean all the time.

1275
01:20:38,616 --> 01:20:41,851
They think they can do whatever they want to you and get away with it.

1276
01:20:41,853 --> 01:20:46,422
But they didn't know I was here, did they?

1277
01:20:46,424 --> 01:20:49,525
I've been waiting a long time for this,

1278
01:20:49,527 --> 01:20:52,094
A long time.

1279
01:20:52,096 --> 01:20:53,762
In the end

1280
01:20:53,764 --> 01:20:56,199
They all get what they deserve.

1281
01:20:56,201 --> 01:20:58,918
I knew it was you.

1282
01:21:00,272 --> 01:21:04,040
Michael thought skinning frogs was cool.

1283
01:21:04,042 --> 01:21:06,759
Ask him how cool it is now.

1284
01:21:06,761 --> 01:21:09,745
Angela!

1285
01:21:21,359 --> 01:21:22,909
Oh, god.

1286
01:21:27,566 --> 01:21:29,399
No!

1287
01:25:37,281 --> 01:25:41,016
Ugh.  Oh, god.

1288
01:25:41,018 --> 01:25:42,935
- You need a hand, miss?
- Yes, please.

1289
01:25:42,937 --> 01:25:45,087
I have this leak and this is my boyfriend's car.

1290
01:25:45,089 --> 01:25:47,456
A leak? You got a flat? Okay, calm down.

1291
01:25:47,458 --> 01:25:49,825
Give me a second here.

1292
01:25:49,827 --> 01:25:51,827
- He's gonna kill me.
- I'm looking at it.

1293
01:25:51,829 --> 01:25:54,430
You have no idea. This is his car.

1294
01:25:54,432 --> 01:25:56,832
You got a brake leak. You can't drive this car.

1295
01:25:56,834 --> 01:25:58,884
- I have to drive this car.
- You can't drive the car.

1296
01:25:58,886 --> 01:26:01,003
You don't understand how fucked I'll be if I don't.

1297
01:26:01,005 --> 01:26:03,889
No, you have to go to a garage-- A garage.

1298
01:26:03,891 --> 01:26:06,058
Please, you have to do something. I have to get it home.

1299
01:26:06,060 --> 01:26:08,060
If I don't, he's gonna fucking kill--

1300
01:26:08,062 --> 01:26:10,062
- Who's gonna kill you?
- Okay, my boyfriend.

1301
01:26:10,064 --> 01:26:12,164
- Forget about your boyfriend.
- Fuck it!

1302
01:26:12,166 --> 01:26:13,482
- Call him and take a cab.
- Fuck.
