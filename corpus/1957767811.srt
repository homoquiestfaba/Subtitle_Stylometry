1
00:02:23,279 --> 00:02:25,696
Sister, why are you up so early?

2
00:02:33,404 --> 00:02:34,946
Where were you?

3
00:02:35,613 --> 00:02:38,047
I went to the store for milk.

4
00:02:38,071 --> 00:02:39,904
We were out.

5
00:02:58,279 --> 00:02:59,821
Your bra is hooked inside out.

6
00:03:09,404 --> 00:03:12,029
Faster, we're going to be late.

7
00:03:45,529 --> 00:03:48,321
Hey, people can see your butt.

8
00:04:07,404 --> 00:04:09,196
Slow down.

9
00:04:10,196 --> 00:04:11,529
What the fuck?

10
00:04:12,696 --> 00:04:15,005
- Shut up for a second sailor!
- You're fucking this up.

11
00:04:15,029 --> 00:04:16,904
Bring the ice!

12
00:04:18,196 --> 00:04:20,089
You talk too much!

13
00:04:20,113 --> 00:04:22,547
You are here to work
not chit chat.

14
00:04:22,571 --> 00:04:24,363
Easy, man.

15
00:04:25,196 --> 00:04:28,946
I'm not paying this new guy.
It's not a charity here, I run a shop.

16
00:04:29,571 --> 00:04:31,672
Chop-chop now, alright?

17
00:04:31,696 --> 00:04:33,714
Okay, I get it. Next time.

18
00:04:33,738 --> 00:04:35,255
- Chop, chop!
- Teresa...

19
00:04:35,279 --> 00:04:36,738
I don't like this guy.

20
00:04:38,696 --> 00:04:40,297
I really don't.

21
00:04:40,321 --> 00:04:42,113
Ma'am, what can Emy do this morning?

22
00:04:43,113 --> 00:04:44,404
Come here.

23
00:04:48,029 --> 00:04:51,488
Try again, like I showed you.

24
00:04:59,896 --> 00:05:01,521
Bring the van keys over here.

25
00:05:02,071 --> 00:05:03,488
Don't take them with you.

26
00:05:10,029 --> 00:05:11,422
Teresa!

27
00:05:11,446 --> 00:05:13,071
Come here.

28
00:05:19,279 --> 00:05:23,797
Do you think he's stealing
fish to sell on his own?

29
00:05:23,821 --> 00:05:26,630
I don't think he would do that.

30
00:05:26,654 --> 00:05:28,964
But I'll check last week's report.

31
00:05:28,988 --> 00:05:31,279
I'll look after Emy.

32
00:05:33,779 --> 00:05:35,363
Do you know what kind of fish this is?

33
00:05:38,279 --> 00:05:39,696
Grouper.

34
00:05:56,863 --> 00:06:01,714
Teresa! Come down here,
keep an eye on the shop and your sister.

35
00:06:01,738 --> 00:06:03,339
I'm going to Maria's.

36
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:05,071
I'll be right down.

37
00:06:12,196 --> 00:06:13,863
Time for a break.

38
00:06:17,446 --> 00:06:18,863
Don't rat on me.

39
00:06:43,279 --> 00:06:44,571
Good morning.

40
00:06:47,238 --> 00:06:48,946
Are you open for business?

41
00:06:51,988 --> 00:06:53,613
One moment.

42
00:07:07,821 --> 00:07:09,380
You drive me crazy.

43
00:07:09,404 --> 00:07:11,154
With your tight pussy...

44
00:07:12,113 --> 00:07:14,321
and your slit eyes...

45
00:07:14,988 --> 00:07:17,214
and your round face.

46
00:07:17,238 --> 00:07:18,488
Tell me, what do you want?

47
00:07:18,988 --> 00:07:20,321
Tell me, what do you want?

48
00:07:33,279 --> 00:07:35,571
Can you cut three fish steaks for me?

49
00:08:13,231 --> 00:08:14,731
You like dirty talk?

50
00:08:15,238 --> 00:08:16,571
Do you?

51
00:08:37,488 --> 00:08:39,154
Do you have a nosebleed?

52
00:08:39,779 --> 00:08:41,113
Did you cut yourself?

53
00:08:54,571 --> 00:08:56,797
Teresa!

54
00:08:56,821 --> 00:08:57,880
Where are you?

55
00:08:57,904 --> 00:08:59,113
I didn't ask...

56
00:09:00,821 --> 00:09:02,321
Did you like it?

57
00:09:04,654 --> 00:09:06,071
It was fine.

58
00:09:08,529 --> 00:09:10,738
Teresa! Teresa!

59
00:09:11,529 --> 00:09:16,297
Where were you?
Why did you leave Emy to chop the fish?

60
00:09:16,321 --> 00:09:19,755
I'm so sorry, ma'am,
I just needed to be upstairs...

61
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:22,321
I shouldn't have allowed Emy
to work here.

62
00:09:22,821 --> 00:09:24,547
I am running a business here!

63
00:09:24,571 --> 00:09:27,141
I am sorry...
Let me give you some fish for free.

64
00:09:27,166 --> 00:09:28,255
Yes, okay.

65
00:09:28,279 --> 00:09:30,571
Make sure her cut doesn't get infected.

66
00:09:56,196 --> 00:10:02,988
HOLY EMY

67
00:10:09,738 --> 00:10:11,255
Teresa.

68
00:10:11,279 --> 00:10:13,488
Happy birthday, Teresa.

69
00:10:16,529 --> 00:10:18,321
Don't be late.

70
00:10:19,613 --> 00:10:21,363
It's a special day.

71
00:10:28,654 --> 00:10:30,821
Take me to church with you today.

72
00:10:31,571 --> 00:10:32,755
What?

73
00:10:32,779 --> 00:10:35,738
Take me to church with you.
It's a special day.

74
00:10:37,529 --> 00:10:39,946
Why do you even want to come?

75
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:44,446
I just want to meet your new friends.

76
00:10:48,363 --> 00:10:50,821
You know that you can't handle it.

77
00:11:16,571 --> 00:11:20,214
Holy Lord is Your Name

78
00:11:20,238 --> 00:11:23,529
From the heavens above

79
00:11:24,071 --> 00:11:27,446
Blessed be the Lord's Name

80
00:11:27,904 --> 00:11:31,797
Sing His glory forever

81
00:11:31,821 --> 00:11:35,196
Holy, Holy is the Lord

82
00:11:35,654 --> 00:11:40,363
For he dwells in our land.

83
00:11:54,238 --> 00:11:58,529
"Not forsaking
the assembling of ourselves together

84
00:11:58,988 --> 00:12:00,988
as in the manner of some

85
00:12:01,404 --> 00:12:05,130
but exhorting one another
and so much the more

86
00:12:05,154 --> 00:12:08,738
as you see the Day approaching."

87
00:12:09,738 --> 00:12:13,363
Hebrews 10:25

88
00:12:15,238 --> 00:12:16,404
Now...

89
00:12:16,946 --> 00:12:21,279
what does this verse
say to us here today?

90
00:12:22,488 --> 00:12:23,171
Teresa...!

91
00:12:23,196 --> 00:12:24,505
You come to me and say

92
00:12:24,586 --> 00:12:26,770
"Every Sunday I have to come
to church?"

93
00:12:27,154 --> 00:12:32,071
But you need to understand
what the Lord is asking of us.

94
00:12:32,738 --> 00:12:33,988
Next song.

95
00:12:41,613 --> 00:12:46,404
You are good, Lord

96
00:12:48,446 --> 00:12:51,946
All the time

97
00:12:52,446 --> 00:12:55,404
Every day

98
00:12:56,238 --> 00:13:02,214
You are always faithful
when you love...

99
00:13:02,238 --> 00:13:04,071
I just wanted to be with you.

100
00:13:04,654 --> 00:13:06,238
Calm down.

101
00:13:12,310 --> 00:13:14,321
I told you not to come.

102
00:13:16,488 --> 00:13:17,738
Teresa.

103
00:13:19,446 --> 00:13:20,738
Teresa.

104
00:13:29,904 --> 00:13:31,029
Teresa.

105
00:13:34,946 --> 00:13:36,363
Teresa.

106
00:13:38,988 --> 00:13:40,529
Teresa.

107
00:13:46,196 --> 00:13:49,047
Mrs Chua told me
what happened with Emy.

108
00:13:49,071 --> 00:13:51,630
- Calm down sister.
- We will take care of her.

109
00:13:51,654 --> 00:13:54,988
Thank you for all your help, sister.

110
00:13:56,654 --> 00:13:57,904
What's this?

111
00:14:01,738 --> 00:14:03,446
I'm sorry.

112
00:14:04,279 --> 00:14:06,071
I'm just having my period.

113
00:14:13,529 --> 00:14:16,089
- It's pretty, right?
- It's sexy.

114
00:14:16,113 --> 00:14:18,714
You're too much.
Look at the back.

115
00:14:18,738 --> 00:14:20,130
Girls!

116
00:14:20,154 --> 00:14:23,964
What's going on? The sermon isn't over.

117
00:14:23,988 --> 00:14:25,464
We're sorry.

118
00:14:25,488 --> 00:14:27,738
Go back inside,
and show some respect.

119
00:14:28,863 --> 00:14:31,005
Has Emy had her period yet?

120
00:14:31,029 --> 00:14:32,154
Not yet.

121
00:14:33,196 --> 00:14:34,639
She's like your mother.

122
00:14:34,664 --> 00:14:36,714
- She needs to get baptized...
- Be quiet already.

123
00:14:36,739 --> 00:14:38,566
So the evil spirits
get away from her.

124
00:14:38,591 --> 00:14:39,630
I don't want to.

125
00:14:39,654 --> 00:14:41,904
Shh. Don't be noisy.

126
00:14:42,446 --> 00:14:47,279
When you are done come back inside.

127
00:14:51,488 --> 00:14:54,154
I don't have time to bring you home.

128
00:14:54,779 --> 00:14:56,946
So be quiet, stop this.

129
00:15:03,404 --> 00:15:06,714
Sister, sister! Does it look good?

130
00:15:06,738 --> 00:15:07,946
It's nice.

131
00:15:08,821 --> 00:15:10,071
Teresa!

132
00:15:11,029 --> 00:15:12,755
Can I have a look?

133
00:15:12,779 --> 00:15:14,505
It fits you well.

134
00:15:14,529 --> 00:15:16,630
- Thank you.
- Take care of the dress.

135
00:15:16,654 --> 00:15:18,839
- Yes.
- Don't move around a lot.

136
00:15:18,863 --> 00:15:22,505
There they are. Good morning.
The flowers are beautiful.

137
00:15:22,529 --> 00:15:24,880
This is Teresa, it's her birthday too.

138
00:15:24,904 --> 00:15:27,464
Happy birthday!
Welcome to our church, sister.

139
00:15:27,488 --> 00:15:29,654
- I'll take this.
- Okay, thank you.

140
00:15:30,321 --> 00:15:32,797
Please just put them
downstairs, sisters.

141
00:15:32,821 --> 00:15:34,488
Hi, Linda.

142
00:15:40,738 --> 00:15:41,988
How are you, Emy?

143
00:15:44,779 --> 00:15:46,071
Fine.

144
00:15:59,529 --> 00:16:00,946
Did you see who is here?

145
00:16:02,071 --> 00:16:03,630
What is she doing here?

146
00:16:03,654 --> 00:16:05,696
I am sorry. I will deal with her.

147
00:16:07,196 --> 00:16:09,547
What are you doing here, Mrs Christina?

148
00:16:09,571 --> 00:16:11,488
I came to wish you happy birthday.

149
00:16:12,029 --> 00:16:13,863
Here, I have something for you.

150
00:16:17,238 --> 00:16:19,089
I'm looking for a girl again.

151
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:21,797
It has been impossible for me
to find someone.

152
00:16:21,821 --> 00:16:23,071
I'll check, Miss.

153
00:16:26,321 --> 00:16:28,238
Do you want the job, Emy?

154
00:16:29,271 --> 00:16:31,230
We already have a job, Miss.

155
00:16:32,029 --> 00:16:33,863
You shouldn't come here.

156
00:16:35,946 --> 00:16:39,714
Mrs Christina you need to leave.
You are not welcome here.

157
00:16:39,738 --> 00:16:40,938
Go downstairs. Go down. Go on.

158
00:16:41,696 --> 00:16:45,363
Where are your good Christian manners?

159
00:17:23,738 --> 00:17:28,571
There, our debutants are so good.
They are very good looking debutants.

160
00:17:31,279 --> 00:17:34,589
Don't they remind you guys of our youth?

161
00:17:34,613 --> 00:17:39,946
It reminds me of when I met
my special man.

162
00:17:44,779 --> 00:17:47,154
Jonathan, John!

163
00:17:48,363 --> 00:17:51,672
Come down here, join your
partner debutants, very good.

164
00:17:51,696 --> 00:17:54,797
What, there is no partner for Teresa?
Oy boys!

165
00:17:54,821 --> 00:17:58,589
Who wants to dance with...

166
00:17:58,613 --> 00:18:02,130
Mike, come back here.
Mike is single, ladies!

167
00:18:02,154 --> 00:18:03,964
You are single, right?

168
00:18:03,988 --> 00:18:05,696
What's wrong?

169
00:18:06,488 --> 00:18:08,029
I don't have another rose...

170
00:18:08,863 --> 00:18:14,363
Oooh that's fine...
Come on, go ahead

171
00:18:15,779 --> 00:18:19,172
after all you already started something
with Teresa.

172
00:18:19,196 --> 00:18:23,964
We don't want any complications,
stay in the same couple.

173
00:18:23,988 --> 00:18:26,529
Maestro, sweet music, please.

174
00:19:45,029 --> 00:19:47,464
Do you want to cut off my split ends?

175
00:19:47,488 --> 00:19:49,154
Not now, I'm tired.

176
00:20:00,988 --> 00:20:03,946
I haven't been to Mrs Christina's
house in a long time.

177
00:20:08,863 --> 00:20:12,321
I went there when I had to pack up
Mom's stuff.

178
00:20:12,779 --> 00:20:15,529
It is still the same.
A house of sinners.

179
00:20:18,196 --> 00:20:20,714
That's what Tita Linda would say.

180
00:20:20,738 --> 00:20:22,571
Give me the scissors.

181
00:20:31,988 --> 00:20:34,797
Mrs Christina wasn't good to Mom.

182
00:20:34,821 --> 00:20:38,154
She took advantage of Mom's kindness.

183
00:20:42,613 --> 00:20:44,196
Close your eyes.

184
00:20:52,363 --> 00:20:54,571
Her house was beautiful.

185
00:22:57,404 --> 00:22:59,904
Here it is, your mother's old room.

186
00:23:11,613 --> 00:23:13,946
Here is your mother and Luis.

187
00:23:14,363 --> 00:23:16,505
They were in the Philippines.

188
00:23:16,529 --> 00:23:18,738
Luis was a sailor at the time.

189
00:23:19,279 --> 00:23:22,113
Come on. Let's go in and see him.

190
00:23:48,071 --> 00:23:50,071
We are not done yet.

191
00:23:52,988 --> 00:23:55,404
Do you know who is this?

192
00:23:55,946 --> 00:23:58,279
Emy. Pilar's daughter.

193
00:24:00,446 --> 00:24:02,363
Okay, we will leave.

194
00:24:21,696 --> 00:24:24,446
They shouldn't have taken
your mom from me.

195
00:24:28,863 --> 00:24:31,363
You should come again.
Soon.

196
00:24:48,821 --> 00:24:52,130
We are calling unto you,
Lord Jesus Christ

197
00:24:52,154 --> 00:24:55,529
for our sister Emy to be safe.

198
00:24:56,196 --> 00:24:58,654
Sister! Sister!

199
00:25:00,363 --> 00:25:04,279
Where were you?
I was so worried about you.

200
00:25:06,488 --> 00:25:10,279
I almost went crazy from fear.

201
00:25:12,113 --> 00:25:16,005
Emy, you are inviting the devil
into your home.

202
00:25:16,029 --> 00:25:17,863
What is she doing here?

203
00:25:18,446 --> 00:25:21,089
- I was so worried.
- Let us protect you.

204
00:25:21,113 --> 00:25:22,505
Sister!

205
00:25:22,529 --> 00:25:27,154
Emy, I only called her because
I was worried about you. Sister!

206
00:25:27,654 --> 00:25:28,922
Sister!

207
00:25:28,946 --> 00:25:30,922
Teresa, get her out of here!

208
00:25:30,946 --> 00:25:33,904
Emy, did you go
to Mrs Christina?

209
00:25:34,488 --> 00:25:37,672
You know that place is dangerous.

210
00:25:37,696 --> 00:25:40,964
Get her out of here, Teresa!

211
00:25:40,988 --> 00:25:44,089
Your mother is a witch doctor,
they just used her.

212
00:25:44,113 --> 00:25:46,363
They don't believe in God,
they are liars!

213
00:25:57,238 --> 00:25:58,571
Sister...

214
00:25:58,988 --> 00:26:00,863
Please open the door.

215
00:26:55,321 --> 00:26:57,589
Is Teresa home?

216
00:26:57,613 --> 00:26:58,946
No, she's at work.

217
00:27:03,029 --> 00:27:05,529
If you need some groceries,
just let me know.

218
00:27:40,488 --> 00:27:43,321
Are you going to get groceries
after work?

219
00:27:45,738 --> 00:27:50,154
I don't want to go to work.
I don't feel well.

220
00:28:13,238 --> 00:28:14,571
Fireball!

221
00:28:58,196 --> 00:28:59,488
Fireball!

222
00:29:00,029 --> 00:29:03,571
She was here, on the balcony
and now she's gone. She's pregnant.

223
00:29:04,821 --> 00:29:06,654
- What color is she?
- Grey.

224
00:29:16,779 --> 00:29:18,363
She is over there.

225
00:29:18,821 --> 00:29:21,672
That's my cat.
What are you doing to her?

226
00:29:21,696 --> 00:29:23,863
Put her down! She's pregnant.

227
00:29:24,946 --> 00:29:26,988
I'll call the police!

228
00:29:29,404 --> 00:29:31,279
You are hurting her.

229
00:29:32,154 --> 00:29:33,613
I said, let her down.

230
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,005
What is going on?

231
00:29:37,029 --> 00:29:39,214
What do you think?
She has a soul too!

232
00:29:39,238 --> 00:29:41,571
Yes, yes, I'll bring your cat upstairs.

233
00:29:49,738 --> 00:29:52,613
Emy, give me the cat.

234
00:29:57,488 --> 00:29:58,488
Come on.

235
00:30:04,946 --> 00:30:08,654
Since your mother left
for the Philippines

236
00:30:09,321 --> 00:30:12,279
I've felt like a mother to you here.

237
00:30:16,113 --> 00:30:20,071
Do you remember what happened
to your mom before she left?

238
00:30:22,779 --> 00:30:25,071
We thought we wouldn't find her,
remember?

239
00:30:28,571 --> 00:30:29,738
Emy.

240
00:30:30,446 --> 00:30:35,005
There's nothing greater
than our Jesus Christ's embrace.

241
00:30:35,029 --> 00:30:36,880
You need to get baptized

242
00:30:36,904 --> 00:30:40,113
because it's the only way
for the Holy Spirit to protect you.

243
00:30:44,508 --> 00:30:47,758
Our mother believes
that there are other spirits.

244
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:56,422
Listen to me, if you're in need

245
00:30:56,446 --> 00:31:00,089
don't be afraid to call upon Him,
to ask for guidance.

246
00:31:00,113 --> 00:31:02,547
You can also ask me.

247
00:31:02,571 --> 00:31:05,571
Especially if there's something strange
happening to you.

248
00:31:08,904 --> 00:31:10,654
Do you know how to pray?

249
00:31:12,696 --> 00:31:14,279
No.

250
00:31:33,071 --> 00:31:35,363
Why are you only calling me now?

251
00:31:35,863 --> 00:31:40,696
I've been waiting. I saved
my dinner so we could eat together.

252
00:31:41,196 --> 00:31:42,529
Hello, Mom.

253
00:31:43,196 --> 00:31:48,279
I wanted to call you, Mom. But Teresa
doesn't let me use her computer.

254
00:31:49,363 --> 00:31:52,005
Who cooked the food you're having?

255
00:31:52,029 --> 00:31:54,029
Linda made it.

256
00:31:58,529 --> 00:32:00,071
Why aren't you eating, my love?

257
00:32:00,613 --> 00:32:05,029
My body hurts and my feet hurt too.

258
00:32:05,446 --> 00:32:08,321
Why is God punishing me?

259
00:32:11,446 --> 00:32:14,321
God never liked our family.

260
00:32:15,154 --> 00:32:17,196
Mom, did you know...

261
00:32:17,988 --> 00:32:20,946
Teresa wants to tell her boyfriend
that she's pregnant.

262
00:32:24,613 --> 00:32:27,279
Don't tell him, my child.

263
00:32:28,154 --> 00:32:30,029
You'll regret it.

264
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:35,238
You have us.
You'll not be alone.

265
00:32:35,779 --> 00:32:39,571
And I raised you perfectly fine
without a father, right?

266
00:32:41,363 --> 00:32:44,946
Mom, did you know, Emy lost her job.

267
00:32:46,279 --> 00:32:49,154
Don't you worry. I'll figure it out.

268
00:32:50,571 --> 00:32:54,863
Why can't I just work
at Mrs Christina's?

269
00:32:57,321 --> 00:32:58,904
What?

270
00:32:59,446 --> 00:33:01,797
Do you even know
what you're talking about?

271
00:33:01,821 --> 00:33:03,071
Teresa

272
00:33:05,613 --> 00:33:08,571
what is your sister saying?
Explain it to me!

273
00:33:09,488 --> 00:33:11,005
Nothing.

274
00:33:11,029 --> 00:33:15,363
I can't be the only one working
while we wait for you to make a plan.

275
00:33:16,613 --> 00:33:19,547
By the way, Linda just said

276
00:33:19,571 --> 00:33:23,654
I don't want Linda anywhere near Emy!

277
00:33:24,696 --> 00:33:26,363
It's three in the morning!!

278
00:33:26,863 --> 00:33:29,130
Shut up! I am speaking
to my daughters!

279
00:33:29,154 --> 00:33:31,738
- Go to sleep!
- Look what you've done.

280
00:33:33,196 --> 00:33:35,154
Be sweet to her.

281
00:33:40,363 --> 00:33:42,363
Mom, I miss you.

282
00:33:43,571 --> 00:33:45,946
I miss you too, my love.

283
00:33:46,821 --> 00:33:51,029
Tell me again the story
about when I was born.

284
00:33:53,988 --> 00:33:56,696
You didn't want to be born.

285
00:33:59,863 --> 00:34:02,279
We were on a boat ride
with your father.

286
00:34:03,654 --> 00:34:06,172
You were three weeks late

287
00:34:06,196 --> 00:34:08,904
so we weren't expecting you
to be born that day.

288
00:34:11,821 --> 00:34:17,238
Suddenly big waves came our way.

289
00:34:18,571 --> 00:34:20,321
After throwing up what we ate...

290
00:34:21,654 --> 00:34:24,297
I still remember what we had for dinner

291
00:34:24,321 --> 00:34:28,880
it was fish cooked in coconut cream

292
00:34:28,904 --> 00:34:33,422
I told your father "She's here."

293
00:34:33,446 --> 00:34:35,922
He still believed you were a boy.

294
00:34:35,946 --> 00:34:38,571
It took forty hours to get you out.

295
00:34:40,446 --> 00:34:43,446
Just when I thought
I didn't have the strength in me

296
00:34:43,946 --> 00:34:48,089
I called onto the spirits

297
00:34:48,113 --> 00:34:52,321
and asked for their help.

298
00:34:52,946 --> 00:34:58,904
I said, "Please,
please help my baby come out."

299
00:35:01,321 --> 00:35:04,321
And they did.

300
00:35:06,279 --> 00:35:08,946
And when I saw you
I wanted to hug you.

301
00:35:10,779 --> 00:35:12,946
You were covered in blood

302
00:35:14,654 --> 00:35:17,863
that's when I knew
you were just like me.

303
00:35:32,863 --> 00:35:38,113
You promised Mom you wouldn't tell him,
this is our secret.

304
00:36:02,904 --> 00:36:04,321
Good morning.

305
00:36:08,863 --> 00:36:10,154
Good morning.

306
00:36:19,154 --> 00:36:20,654
Where's mine?

307
00:36:21,488 --> 00:36:23,988
You're late. I sold it to Valentin.

308
00:36:26,571 --> 00:36:28,880
Where are you going?
Let it go, you asshole!

309
00:36:28,904 --> 00:36:32,321
Let it go you idiot,
they'll kick your ass, asshole!

310
00:36:34,988 --> 00:36:36,339
Dude, are you Valentin?

311
00:36:36,363 --> 00:36:37,880
Yes, I am Valentin.

312
00:36:37,904 --> 00:36:39,755
This box is mine.

313
00:36:39,779 --> 00:36:40,922
It is my box.

314
00:36:40,946 --> 00:36:43,089
That box with the cross is mine!

315
00:36:43,113 --> 00:36:45,422
- It is mine.
- Look at this asshole!

316
00:36:45,446 --> 00:36:48,547
- That box is mine.
- Enough of this, asshole. It's mine.

317
00:36:48,571 --> 00:36:51,797
- What don't you understand?
- Get off, it's mine.

318
00:36:51,821 --> 00:36:54,005
Let that jerk get beaten up.

319
00:36:54,029 --> 00:36:56,130
What are you doing? Stop!

320
00:36:56,154 --> 00:36:58,172
- Drop it. It's mine!
- Give it here!

321
00:36:58,196 --> 00:36:59,547
Give the box here!

322
00:36:59,571 --> 00:37:01,446
- Let's go home.
- Get out of the way.

323
00:37:01,988 --> 00:37:04,380
- Break it up!
- Stop this crap.

324
00:37:04,404 --> 00:37:06,154
It's over!

325
00:37:07,279 --> 00:37:09,005
Fucking Albanians! Get up.

326
00:37:09,029 --> 00:37:10,589
- It's over!
- Go back to your jobs!

327
00:37:10,613 --> 00:37:13,089
- Jerk!
- Are you okay?

328
00:37:13,113 --> 00:37:14,946
I slipped on a fucking fish.

329
00:37:16,238 --> 00:37:17,529
Move it, let's go.

330
00:37:22,113 --> 00:37:23,279
I'm fine.

331
00:37:24,113 --> 00:37:26,005
I said, I'm fine.

332
00:37:26,029 --> 00:37:27,363
I'll do it.

333
00:37:27,904 --> 00:37:29,946
Okay, you can take care of me.

334
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:34,488
That guy was very lucky.

335
00:37:34,904 --> 00:37:39,279
Sailor, sit in the back.

336
00:37:41,904 --> 00:37:43,488
Sure thing, you lovebird.

337
00:37:44,821 --> 00:37:46,279
Emy, come on.

338
00:38:04,101 --> 00:38:06,422
I told you, you asshole,
to go out and do something nice

339
00:38:06,446 --> 00:38:07,946
you don't give a shit.

340
00:38:09,946 --> 00:38:12,922
To go fight an asshole,
what's his name, Sal am Alaykum.

341
00:38:12,946 --> 00:38:14,946
And on top of that, he beat you up.

342
00:38:15,488 --> 00:38:18,946
Where are we?
Where did you bring us? Goddamn it!

343
00:38:28,279 --> 00:38:31,113
You asshole! I can't take
it anymore, I have to fuck.

344
00:38:38,404 --> 00:38:41,863
Shut up Sailor.

345
00:38:42,779 --> 00:38:44,589
What?

346
00:38:44,613 --> 00:38:46,654
We could have gone to my place!

347
00:38:49,279 --> 00:38:52,255
We could've stopped at a bar
and picked up some pretty girls.

348
00:38:52,279 --> 00:38:54,738
- We have pretty girls here.
- Yeah, right.

349
00:38:56,779 --> 00:38:59,214
What?

350
00:38:59,238 --> 00:39:01,863
You like this?

351
00:39:02,529 --> 00:39:04,738
What? You know you are
a very beautiful girl.

352
00:39:05,238 --> 00:39:06,589
You owe me a beer.

353
00:39:06,613 --> 00:39:08,113
You owe me a beer.

354
00:39:08,613 --> 00:39:10,738
You asshole... Really?

355
00:39:23,863 --> 00:39:27,297
Come on, why do you get riled up?
Why do you break my heart?

356
00:39:27,321 --> 00:39:29,654
Let me come next to you.

357
00:39:30,321 --> 00:39:35,071
Tell me, is he right?

358
00:39:45,154 --> 00:39:47,238
Tell me. Do you understand me?

359
00:39:49,363 --> 00:39:50,654
Play with my dick.

360
00:39:55,738 --> 00:39:58,363
Stop talking shit to the girls.

361
00:40:03,154 --> 00:40:06,839
I spent six months in the same cabin
with a Filipino sailor, Miguel.

362
00:40:06,863 --> 00:40:08,755
I know a great deal about their women

363
00:40:08,779 --> 00:40:11,255
at first they play hard to get

364
00:40:11,279 --> 00:40:13,714
- Stop it.
- And then they give it all in bed!

365
00:40:13,738 --> 00:40:17,488
Quit it man. These girls
aren't like the ones you know.

366
00:40:18,696 --> 00:40:20,696
What's wrong? What is it?

367
00:40:23,946 --> 00:40:26,779
- I'm gonna tell you something.
- What is it?

368
00:40:27,529 --> 00:40:29,571
Teresa, don't tell him.

369
00:40:37,529 --> 00:40:40,297
I'm pregnant.

370
00:40:40,321 --> 00:40:44,172
What are you doing?
Stop it! Stop it!

371
00:40:44,196 --> 00:40:46,214
Let him go!

372
00:40:46,238 --> 00:40:48,255
Fuck, let go of my fucking hand!

373
00:40:48,279 --> 00:40:50,547
I said, stop it!

374
00:40:50,571 --> 00:40:53,005
Fucking Christ!

375
00:40:53,029 --> 00:40:54,946
She fucking bit me!

376
00:40:57,779 --> 00:41:00,321
Did you listen, you fuck?
I'm gonna be a father.

377
00:41:00,779 --> 00:41:03,696
Well done, you asshole.
Now, start the car so we can leave.

378
00:41:36,029 --> 00:41:38,446
Well done dude!

379
00:41:42,196 --> 00:41:44,154
Teresa!

380
00:41:44,821 --> 00:41:46,113
What?

381
00:41:51,696 --> 00:41:53,238
What do you want to do?

382
00:41:55,113 --> 00:41:56,654
I'll give you the money.

383
00:41:57,904 --> 00:42:00,279
I don't want you to worry.
It's not a big deal.

384
00:42:25,196 --> 00:42:26,946
Teresa, let's go to bed.

385
00:42:28,029 --> 00:42:31,071
Just tell me,
how happy are you right now?

386
00:42:35,279 --> 00:42:37,821
And don't you tell Linda either.

387
00:42:44,071 --> 00:42:45,714
Don't touch me!

388
00:42:45,738 --> 00:42:48,172
Why don't you let me touch it?

389
00:42:48,196 --> 00:42:50,029
It's mine, not yours.

390
00:43:00,696 --> 00:43:03,238
I want to work at Mrs Christina's.

391
00:43:16,613 --> 00:43:20,488
Go on, do what you want.
You're on your own.

392
00:44:39,488 --> 00:44:41,696
You did good with the salad.

393
00:44:45,113 --> 00:44:49,279
Ismini is showing good signs
of improvement.

394
00:44:49,988 --> 00:44:51,571
Right, Luis?

395
00:45:00,821 --> 00:45:02,363
We are eating.

396
00:45:02,946 --> 00:45:05,363
Come on.

397
00:45:10,779 --> 00:45:13,946
I forgot our pills, excuse me.

398
00:45:22,488 --> 00:45:27,571
Don't pay attention to him.
He has become grumpy over the years.

399
00:45:30,779 --> 00:45:32,696
Do you know how to bake?

400
00:45:33,696 --> 00:45:35,904
- No.
- It's okay.

401
00:45:36,654 --> 00:45:40,279
I have them delivered
from a very good pastry shop nearby.

402
00:45:42,196 --> 00:45:44,029
I like sweets too.

403
00:45:45,404 --> 00:45:50,279
A diabetic like me shouldn't eat sweets,
nor smoke.

404
00:45:51,738 --> 00:45:52,904
He's right.

405
00:45:55,404 --> 00:45:56,863
Go pick it up.

406
00:46:03,779 --> 00:46:05,005
Hello?

407
00:46:05,029 --> 00:46:06,529
Not sleeping yet?

408
00:46:06,988 --> 00:46:08,154
Who is it?

409
00:46:09,196 --> 00:46:10,571
It's Teresa.

410
00:46:13,071 --> 00:46:14,630
We are still eating.

411
00:46:14,654 --> 00:46:19,946
Mrs Christina doesn't like to eat early,
it makes her sad.

412
00:46:21,946 --> 00:46:24,029
How are you?

413
00:46:25,863 --> 00:46:27,863
I miss the TV.

414
00:46:28,321 --> 00:46:30,446
The TV misses you too.

415
00:46:32,738 --> 00:46:35,029
What time are you coming
on your day off?

416
00:46:35,821 --> 00:46:38,363
Do you want to come
to the Doctor with me?

417
00:46:41,071 --> 00:46:42,505
Really?

418
00:46:42,529 --> 00:46:45,005
Or we can meet at home?

419
00:46:45,029 --> 00:46:48,571
All I'm asking
is let her help you.

420
00:46:51,613 --> 00:46:53,238
Let me go, madam.

421
00:46:54,029 --> 00:46:57,154
- Are you jealous?
- Sure.

422
00:47:26,279 --> 00:47:28,738
I don't want you to worry.

423
00:47:32,196 --> 00:47:33,363
Emy.

424
00:47:38,696 --> 00:47:41,321
I didn't introduce you.

425
00:47:41,779 --> 00:47:43,113
This is Emy.

426
00:47:43,779 --> 00:47:45,446
Pilar's daughter.

427
00:47:46,404 --> 00:47:48,113
Beautiful girl.

428
00:47:48,904 --> 00:47:51,071
She is a pure soul.

429
00:47:54,279 --> 00:47:56,172
Go upstairs.

430
00:47:56,196 --> 00:47:58,946
Why? Luis asked for me?

431
00:47:59,488 --> 00:48:01,238
Go upstairs I tell you.

432
00:48:16,196 --> 00:48:17,196
Come in.

433
00:48:31,488 --> 00:48:33,488
Okay, my boy? Everything's fine.

434
00:48:36,029 --> 00:48:38,029
I'll leave you now. Okay?

435
00:49:14,779 --> 00:49:16,154
Go away.

436
00:49:28,113 --> 00:49:30,904
Luis, they need you upstairs.

437
00:49:55,488 --> 00:49:59,380
Aggelos, don't we look lovely today.

438
00:49:59,404 --> 00:50:02,029
This is Emy. She will be helping me.

439
00:50:03,738 --> 00:50:08,380
Emy, help Aggelos get on the table.

440
00:50:08,404 --> 00:50:11,238
Feet here, head there.

441
00:50:56,779 --> 00:50:58,946
Straighten his legs.

442
00:53:34,571 --> 00:53:36,321
You need to be careful, Emy.

443
00:53:37,696 --> 00:53:40,071
I know you're attracted to healing.

444
00:53:52,779 --> 00:53:54,154
Your hands are strong.

445
00:53:55,571 --> 00:53:57,738
People here will appreciate.

446
00:54:05,196 --> 00:54:09,172
You need to be ready and humble

447
00:54:09,196 --> 00:54:11,946
to receive their admiration.

448
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:15,946
Do you trust me?

449
00:54:20,696 --> 00:54:23,029
You should trust me.

450
00:54:25,154 --> 00:54:27,363
Let me protect you.

451
00:54:28,571 --> 00:54:33,821
Christina only sees her own needs.

452
00:54:35,821 --> 00:54:38,029
What did she do to my mom?

453
00:54:43,363 --> 00:54:46,571
A healer shouldn't accept
money for their gift.

454
00:54:52,863 --> 00:54:56,571
But Christina took advantage of it

455
00:54:56,988 --> 00:54:59,488
and Pilar got punished.

456
00:55:00,821 --> 00:55:03,071
Is this how you were with my mom?

457
00:55:05,029 --> 00:55:10,113
Did you know I was the one
who persuaded your mom to come here?

458
00:55:10,738 --> 00:55:15,571
She let me assist her in what she did

459
00:55:16,113 --> 00:55:17,946
and I would protect her.

460
00:55:18,363 --> 00:55:20,488
Why do you keep these?

461
00:55:22,825 --> 00:55:27,284
I help things take their course.

462
00:55:30,068 --> 00:55:34,110
I can't change their course.

463
00:55:35,613 --> 00:55:37,446
I don't have the ability like Pilar.

464
00:55:39,529 --> 00:55:42,630
There is nothing more humbling
than a body

465
00:55:42,654 --> 00:55:46,571
that doesn't live up to your desires.

466
00:55:49,738 --> 00:55:52,863
What are we if not our own bodies?

467
00:56:12,654 --> 00:56:16,589
I will ask
for a few extra lab tests.

468
00:56:16,613 --> 00:56:18,363
To relieve your stress.

469
00:56:20,279 --> 00:56:21,946
Okay, Teresa?

470
00:56:28,404 --> 00:56:30,738
I still can't eat anything.

471
00:56:41,613 --> 00:56:43,654
Are you resting
like I told you to?

472
00:57:19,738 --> 00:57:22,529
- Let me touch it.
- Don't.

473
00:57:24,321 --> 00:57:27,113
Why don't you ever let me?

474
00:57:28,613 --> 00:57:30,113
It's asleep.

475
00:57:31,196 --> 00:57:32,696
Let me.

476
00:57:33,738 --> 00:57:36,571
Emy, if I say no, it's a no.

477
00:58:44,321 --> 00:58:45,738
Do you have pains?

478
00:58:46,321 --> 00:58:47,321
Yes.

479
00:58:50,363 --> 00:58:52,363
What are you feeling?

480
00:58:54,863 --> 00:58:56,988
Most of the time I'm tired.

481
00:58:58,196 --> 00:59:00,446
And my hair is falling out.

482
00:59:01,988 --> 00:59:07,529
I feel like someone is stabbing me
in the back.

483
00:59:08,696 --> 00:59:13,255
I got spirit in my head
that is keeping me alive

484
00:59:13,279 --> 00:59:16,922
Keeping me alive, keeping me alive

485
00:59:16,946 --> 00:59:21,339
I got spirit in my head
that is keeping me alive

486
00:59:21,363 --> 00:59:24,714
Jesus is keeping me alive.

487
00:59:24,738 --> 00:59:27,154
It might be an aswang.

488
00:59:27,571 --> 00:59:31,279
You shouldn't have Emy around
while you're pregnant.

489
00:59:33,904 --> 00:59:39,654
My cousin lost her baby due to a tiktik
that was visiting her every night.

490
00:59:40,654 --> 00:59:45,214
I got spirit in my hands
that is keeping me alive

491
00:59:45,238 --> 00:59:48,839
Keeping me alive, keeping me alive

492
00:59:48,863 --> 00:59:53,339
I got spirit in my hands
that is keeping me alive

493
00:59:53,363 --> 00:59:56,464
Jesus is keeping me alive.

494
00:59:56,488 --> 00:59:58,071
Can you get up?

495
01:00:00,404 --> 01:00:01,696
Are you sure?

496
01:00:04,529 --> 01:00:09,255
I got spirit in my hips
that is keeping me alive

497
01:00:09,279 --> 01:00:12,630
Jesus is keeping me alive.

498
01:00:12,654 --> 01:00:17,172
I got spirit in my knees
that is keeping me alive

499
01:00:17,196 --> 01:00:20,755
Keeping me alive, keeping me alive

500
01:00:20,779 --> 01:00:25,130
I got spirit in my knees
that is keeping me alive

501
01:00:25,154 --> 01:00:27,714
Jesus is keeping me alive.

502
01:00:27,738 --> 01:00:29,255
Emy, let's go home.

503
01:00:29,279 --> 01:00:31,297
Emy doesn't want to leave yet.

504
01:00:31,321 --> 01:00:33,464
- In a little bit.
- Come on, let's go home.

505
01:00:33,488 --> 01:00:36,755
Keeping me alive, keeping me alive

506
01:00:36,779 --> 01:00:38,339
Let's go, Emy!

507
01:00:38,363 --> 01:00:41,214
I've got spirit in my body
that is keeping me alive

508
01:00:41,238 --> 01:00:44,571
Jesus is keeping me alive.

509
01:01:26,404 --> 01:01:30,363
Ismini, I'll be right outside
if you need me.

510
01:02:04,321 --> 01:02:07,738
Don't feel bad. Everybody has seen them.

511
01:02:11,446 --> 01:02:13,738
- Where is it?
- Here.

512
01:02:28,946 --> 01:02:30,654
Do you feel that?

513
01:02:34,613 --> 01:02:35,863
I feel it too.

514
01:02:53,529 --> 01:02:55,113
Don't laugh.

515
01:03:05,529 --> 01:03:07,696
It hurts. It hurts a bit.

516
01:03:32,863 --> 01:03:35,464
Is everything okay?

517
01:03:35,488 --> 01:03:37,113
Yes, go away.

518
01:03:39,571 --> 01:03:42,029
Stop talking, I know what I am doing.

519
01:05:08,785 --> 01:05:10,285
Thank you.

520
01:05:16,779 --> 01:05:18,279
Thank you very much.

521
01:05:35,904 --> 01:05:37,738
I can't breathe.

522
01:05:48,904 --> 01:05:50,904
Give me my blanket.

523
01:06:00,411 --> 01:06:04,078
I can't move my fingers today.

524
01:06:05,196 --> 01:06:06,946
Fix my hair a bit.

525
01:06:07,863 --> 01:06:09,863
I'm sorry for asking.

526
01:06:17,571 --> 01:06:18,571
Take care.

527
01:06:21,321 --> 01:06:22,547
What's the matter?

528
01:06:22,571 --> 01:06:23,738
Nothing.

529
01:06:35,613 --> 01:06:39,738
Ismini, can I borrow your phone?

530
01:06:41,238 --> 01:06:42,821
Yeah of course.

531
01:06:58,071 --> 01:07:02,571
Sister Rosa, can I speak to Mom,
it's Emy.

532
01:07:04,238 --> 01:07:06,214
Do you know what time it is?

533
01:07:06,238 --> 01:07:08,529
Why are you calling so late?

534
01:07:09,696 --> 01:07:11,571
I need to speak to her.

535
01:07:12,154 --> 01:07:15,071
Where are you calling from?
Where is Teresa?

536
01:07:27,154 --> 01:07:28,696
Ismini.

537
01:07:32,029 --> 01:07:34,821
- All good?
- Yeah.

538
01:07:42,446 --> 01:07:47,446
Any unclaimed vehicle
will be thrown overboard.

539
01:07:48,238 --> 01:07:51,172
Mrs Panagopoulou, please take your dog

540
01:07:51,196 --> 01:07:53,488
cause it's busting our balls!

541
01:07:58,863 --> 01:08:00,279
Try it.

542
01:08:04,363 --> 01:08:06,529
I'm the junk dealer!

543
01:08:08,404 --> 01:08:11,696
Yo! Come over here a sec.

544
01:08:15,529 --> 01:08:16,738
I know this guy.

545
01:08:29,946 --> 01:08:31,154
Nice pickup line!

546
01:08:33,488 --> 01:08:34,654
You're full of tar.

547
01:08:38,904 --> 01:08:40,071
Give me a piece of gum.

548
01:08:50,363 --> 01:08:52,113
What's going on with your friend?

549
01:08:55,029 --> 01:08:56,029
Emy!

550
01:08:56,529 --> 01:08:58,529
What are you doing?

551
01:08:59,738 --> 01:09:01,238
Get out of there!

552
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:04,279
There's tar and dead fish in there!

553
01:09:04,988 --> 01:09:06,363
Emy!

554
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:09,113
- Argyris!
- What?

555
01:12:10,654 --> 01:12:12,446
Hold on.

556
01:12:12,863 --> 01:12:14,238
Not now.

557
01:12:18,196 --> 01:12:19,946
She sent you?

558
01:12:25,738 --> 01:12:28,029
Answer, your sister sent you?

559
01:12:31,071 --> 01:12:33,464
Come with me, come.

560
01:12:33,488 --> 01:12:35,154
Girls, it was my pleasure.

561
01:12:39,404 --> 01:12:40,839
Here, drink.

562
01:12:40,863 --> 01:12:42,880
Careful, don't knock her up too.

563
01:12:42,904 --> 01:12:46,946
Stop it, you asshole! That's enough.

564
01:12:50,696 --> 01:12:53,071
You won't bite tonight, okay?

565
01:12:54,904 --> 01:12:56,130
Pour me another one.

566
01:12:56,154 --> 01:12:58,446
Drink up, it's good for you.

567
01:12:58,988 --> 01:13:01,005
You don't know
how to order, you moron.

568
01:13:01,029 --> 01:13:02,821
She can't drink this.

569
01:13:16,154 --> 01:13:20,047
Listen. Can you leave us alone...

570
01:13:20,071 --> 01:13:23,547
- What your sister did was not cool.
- Can you leave us alone?

571
01:13:23,571 --> 01:13:29,154
Not cool. Because he's a good guy.
Am I wrong?

572
01:13:30,113 --> 01:13:33,255
This cunt your sister did it on purpose.

573
01:13:33,279 --> 01:13:36,422
Do you hear me? On purpose.

574
01:13:36,446 --> 01:13:38,255
She thinks you're a sucker.

575
01:13:38,279 --> 01:13:41,089
You let a cunt boss you around
and that fucks me too!

576
01:13:41,113 --> 01:13:44,946
Stop it, you asshole!
What does this have to do with you?

577
01:14:13,779 --> 01:14:15,738
I want water.

578
01:14:16,863 --> 01:14:19,279
- What are you doing here?
- Stop shouting.

579
01:14:20,904 --> 01:14:22,208
I am here.

580
01:14:22,233 --> 01:14:24,400
- Why did you bring him here?
- I want water.

581
01:14:31,613 --> 01:14:33,255
Are you drunk?

582
01:14:33,279 --> 01:14:35,446
I'm sorry, but I'm here.

583
01:14:35,946 --> 01:14:37,279
I'm here!

584
01:14:53,279 --> 01:14:54,654
How are we doing?

585
01:14:55,821 --> 01:14:57,839
- I am falling asleep.
- What do you want?

586
01:14:57,863 --> 01:14:59,630
Let me sleep here with you.

587
01:14:59,654 --> 01:15:01,904
Come over here.

588
01:15:14,113 --> 01:15:16,529
- I also want the TV.
- Sure.

589
01:15:52,696 --> 01:15:54,946
You're too drunk to sleep, eh?

590
01:16:07,321 --> 01:16:09,363
You need to drink some water.

591
01:16:10,821 --> 01:16:12,363
What happened to you?

592
01:16:14,654 --> 01:16:15,821
Teresa!

593
01:16:16,738 --> 01:16:18,589
Teresa come here!

594
01:16:18,613 --> 01:16:21,464
What's wrong? Are you hurt?
Let me take a look at you.

595
01:16:21,488 --> 01:16:24,672
Do you want to go to the hospital?
Teresa!

596
01:16:24,896 --> 01:16:26,747
Bring my pants.

597
01:16:26,771 --> 01:16:29,039
She is hurt,
we need to go to the hospital.

598
01:16:29,063 --> 01:16:31,229
- Quiet.
- She is hurt.

599
01:16:31,938 --> 01:16:33,580
- It's okay.
- What?

600
01:16:33,604 --> 01:16:36,438
- Don't be loud.
- She is hurt.

601
01:16:41,188 --> 01:16:42,771
What is it?

602
01:16:44,979 --> 01:16:46,563
Eh?

603
01:16:48,521 --> 01:16:49,854
It's okay.

604
01:16:50,771 --> 01:16:53,188
It's okay. Calm down.

605
01:16:58,688 --> 01:17:00,146
What the fuck is happening?

606
01:17:02,146 --> 01:17:03,771
Is she crying blood?

607
01:17:05,979 --> 01:17:08,497
I have to show it to Akis.

608
01:17:08,521 --> 01:17:11,938
- I have to show it to Akis.
- Emy, it's okay...

609
01:17:18,063 --> 01:17:19,705
It's not a big deal.

610
01:17:19,729 --> 01:17:25,205
It happens to some people in
the Philippines. It's no big deal.

611
01:17:25,229 --> 01:17:27,664
- It's nothing!
- What are you telling me?

612
01:17:27,688 --> 01:17:30,896
What do you mean "it's nothing"?
I don't understand!

613
01:17:32,646 --> 01:17:35,854
Teresa, is everything okay?

614
01:17:36,896 --> 01:17:40,521
It's okay. It's nothing. Shh!

615
01:17:43,729 --> 01:17:45,563
Everything's okay.

616
01:17:46,479 --> 01:17:48,104
Are you sure?

617
01:17:48,813 --> 01:17:50,539
I can hear somebody in there.

618
01:17:50,563 --> 01:17:52,604
It was just a bad dream.

619
01:17:53,146 --> 01:17:55,771
Go back to sleep, Tita Linda.

620
01:19:14,688 --> 01:19:16,354
He is dreaming.

621
01:19:20,771 --> 01:19:22,146
Are you better?

622
01:19:23,979 --> 01:19:25,896
I think so.

623
01:19:26,979 --> 01:19:29,146
We'll go to the doctor with Argyris.

624
01:19:30,229 --> 01:19:31,771
Do you want to come with us?

625
01:19:44,104 --> 01:19:46,313
He probably got stuck at work.

626
01:20:31,813 --> 01:20:33,146
Are you okay?

627
01:20:38,688 --> 01:20:42,354
Someone should warn the women.

628
01:21:06,729 --> 01:21:11,021
Emy, can you stay with me
one more day?

629
01:21:18,979 --> 01:21:22,229
Don't. I feel like I haven't
eaten in months.

630
01:21:39,188 --> 01:21:41,896
Didn't we have a doctor's appointment
today?

631
01:21:44,188 --> 01:21:45,688
I brought you a gift.

632
01:21:51,938 --> 01:21:54,021
The new boss doesn't pay much attention.

633
01:21:55,104 --> 01:21:58,271
I'll return the cooler tomorrow.
No harm, no foul.

634
01:22:00,229 --> 01:22:01,771
I'll make dinner.

635
01:22:03,729 --> 01:22:06,563
- Do you want help?
- No.

636
01:22:07,104 --> 01:22:08,854
Emy, stay for dinner!

637
01:22:09,396 --> 01:22:11,146
I'll invite Linda.

638
01:22:29,271 --> 01:22:31,104
Has this ever happened to you before?

639
01:22:33,313 --> 01:22:34,789
Why?

640
01:22:34,813 --> 01:22:36,354
I'm talking about the tears.

641
01:22:36,771 --> 01:22:38,229
Can you do it again?

642
01:22:41,229 --> 01:22:42,938
I've never seen anything like it.

643
01:22:46,063 --> 01:22:47,914
Is that why you're here?

644
01:22:47,938 --> 01:22:49,146
No, I just Googled it.

645
01:22:54,063 --> 01:22:56,021
Look, me and Akis have an idea.

646
01:22:57,438 --> 01:23:00,146
You have no idea how many people
will want to see it.

647
01:23:03,438 --> 01:23:05,539
It will benefit everyone.

648
01:23:05,563 --> 01:23:07,521
Your sister, the baby...

649
01:23:11,188 --> 01:23:12,830
Teresa!

650
01:23:12,854 --> 01:23:14,497
I'm hungry.

651
01:23:14,521 --> 01:23:16,729
What can I do to help you do it again?

652
01:23:17,729 --> 01:23:19,146
Nothing.

653
01:23:23,146 --> 01:23:24,271
Think about it.

654
01:23:27,104 --> 01:23:29,146
He doesn't want this baby.

655
01:23:32,354 --> 01:23:35,021
- What did you do?
- Nothing.

656
01:23:37,313 --> 01:23:39,521
Give me that roasting pan.

657
01:23:50,313 --> 01:23:53,354
That's not why he is here.

658
01:23:59,271 --> 01:24:00,521
Teresa.

659
01:24:02,854 --> 01:24:05,497
Look for what you need.

660
01:24:05,521 --> 01:24:08,122
Whatever you don't need
we can give to the church.

661
01:24:08,146 --> 01:24:10,229
These ones are still in good condition.

662
01:24:10,771 --> 01:24:12,146
Thank you.

663
01:24:13,146 --> 01:24:14,188
Emy, how are you?

664
01:24:16,438 --> 01:24:18,271
Tita Linda, now that I remembered

665
01:24:18,688 --> 01:24:20,896
do you still have the baby's crib?

666
01:24:21,646 --> 01:24:25,146
I was thinking of making
this the baby's room.

667
01:24:28,396 --> 01:24:30,354
So, Linda

668
01:24:37,479 --> 01:24:39,104
Amen. Yes?

669
01:24:39,771 --> 01:24:42,539
Have you known the girls
for a long time?

670
01:24:42,563 --> 01:24:44,313
Since I came to Greece.

671
01:24:45,521 --> 01:24:47,521
Linda is like a mother to us.

672
01:24:47,938 --> 01:24:49,688
No, she's not.

673
01:24:53,021 --> 01:24:55,104
So, do you go to church?

674
01:24:57,063 --> 01:24:58,455
Yes.

675
01:24:58,479 --> 01:25:00,063
You can come with us if you want.

676
01:25:02,729 --> 01:25:06,104
Are there a lot of girls like Emy?

677
01:25:09,229 --> 01:25:11,521
Emy is quite unique.

678
01:25:20,938 --> 01:25:22,563
I told Akis to come.

679
01:25:23,729 --> 01:25:26,229
He's my cousin, Akis.

680
01:25:27,220 --> 01:25:29,664
He can have dinner with us too.

681
01:25:29,688 --> 01:25:31,854
Where will he sit?

682
01:25:36,229 --> 01:25:37,789
Come on, you shit.

683
01:25:37,813 --> 01:25:40,063
- Where were you?
- I brought beers.

684
01:25:40,813 --> 01:25:43,063
What's the deal?

685
01:25:44,396 --> 01:25:48,729
- Why are we sitting down like savages?
- Get in.

686
01:25:50,563 --> 01:25:52,039
Hi, nice to meet you.

687
01:25:52,063 --> 01:25:54,021
Akis, I'll bring you a plate.

688
01:25:59,646 --> 01:26:01,771
We were just talking about

689
01:26:02,938 --> 01:26:04,771
how unique Emy is.

690
01:26:07,229 --> 01:26:10,854
Linda is the girls' mom, almost.

691
01:26:12,021 --> 01:26:14,271
Stop talking about me.

692
01:26:20,813 --> 01:26:22,688
Be careful with the bones.

693
01:26:25,229 --> 01:26:29,146
So, Akis, do you also work
at the fish market?

694
01:26:31,896 --> 01:26:34,563
I'm kind of an entrepreneur.

695
01:26:35,896 --> 01:26:38,146
We're thinking about
starting a new business.

696
01:26:58,813 --> 01:27:01,354
What's wrong, man? Argyris?

697
01:27:02,938 --> 01:27:05,122
- Water, water! Quick!
- Water, man.

698
01:27:05,146 --> 01:27:07,646
- Teresa, do you have bread?
- Argyris!

699
01:27:08,438 --> 01:27:11,539
- Water, water!
- Drink some water!

700
01:27:11,563 --> 01:27:13,205
Teresa do you have any bread?

701
01:27:13,229 --> 01:27:15,313
Argyris! Argyris!

702
01:27:57,646 --> 01:28:00,938
- Argyris, spit it out!
- Emy, stop it!

703
01:28:01,521 --> 01:28:03,664
Emy!

704
01:28:03,688 --> 01:28:05,372
Was that what you wanted?

705
01:28:05,396 --> 01:28:08,354
Emy, don't do this to him.

706
01:28:08,771 --> 01:28:10,104
Emy!

707
01:28:10,646 --> 01:28:14,563
I told you, he did not come here
for the baby.

708
01:29:12,688 --> 01:29:14,372
Look who is here!

709
01:29:14,396 --> 01:29:16,521
- We are late.
- Don't worry about it.

710
01:29:17,188 --> 01:29:19,646
- What a joyful day.
- Of course.

711
01:29:27,646 --> 01:29:29,729
Move it girls.

712
01:29:58,271 --> 01:30:02,955
Thank you for having us.
Cleo recommended you.

713
01:30:02,979 --> 01:30:05,146
- Ah nice.
- Thank you.

714
01:30:17,646 --> 01:30:19,729
Bring me that package.

715
01:30:22,354 --> 01:30:25,938
- Madam, I'm going out tonight.
- Why?

716
01:30:28,063 --> 01:30:30,914
Ismini asked me to.

717
01:30:30,938 --> 01:30:34,104
That's a joke.
What do you two have in common?

718
01:30:36,313 --> 01:30:39,104
You must focus on what we're doing here.

719
01:30:41,063 --> 01:30:42,622
This is for you.

720
01:30:42,646 --> 01:30:46,729
I got your size. The same medical blouse
as your mother's.

721
01:30:49,188 --> 01:30:51,080
You will wear it today.

722
01:30:51,104 --> 01:30:53,854
I'll be the first one you'll treat.

723
01:31:02,563 --> 01:31:05,747
I thought today was a party.

724
01:31:05,771 --> 01:31:08,146
Come fix my zipper. It's stuck.

725
01:31:16,021 --> 01:31:18,580
You must help me.
That's why you're here.

726
01:31:18,604 --> 01:31:21,396
Not only to take and take.

727
01:31:22,479 --> 01:31:25,729
Look at my legs.
They're filled with sores.

728
01:31:26,271 --> 01:31:28,563
I can't do it again today.

729
01:31:30,188 --> 01:31:32,080
I'm so good to you.

730
01:31:32,104 --> 01:31:35,330
I brought you here,
I taught you what you can do.

731
01:31:35,354 --> 01:31:39,896
Not Teresa, not Luis. I did it.

732
01:31:40,688 --> 01:31:42,563
Why are you treating me this way?

733
01:31:46,688 --> 01:31:48,521
Take off my shoes.

734
01:31:53,729 --> 01:31:55,104
Thank you.

735
01:32:07,229 --> 01:32:10,771
We are very lucky to have her with us.

736
01:32:11,229 --> 01:32:13,813
She is lucky to have us.

737
01:32:14,354 --> 01:32:18,789
We all need someone to notice us

738
01:32:18,813 --> 01:32:20,747
to pay attention to us.

739
01:32:20,771 --> 01:32:24,563
If it weren't for us,
Emy wouldn't be what she is.

740
01:32:25,813 --> 01:32:29,688
So, Emy doesn't have a will of her own?

741
01:32:34,313 --> 01:32:37,479
I've never had such a big party
thrown for me.

742
01:32:48,938 --> 01:32:52,021
Luis, Teresa says

743
01:32:52,521 --> 01:32:55,854
that both God and the Devil can heal.

744
01:33:02,313 --> 01:33:07,354
I say that neither God
nor the Devil exist.

745
01:33:08,188 --> 01:33:10,146
Only we exist.

746
01:33:17,313 --> 01:33:18,438
Emy!

747
01:33:35,188 --> 01:33:37,354
- Very beautiful.
- Pretty girl.

748
01:33:37,854 --> 01:33:40,497
I hope she doesn't end up
like her mother.

749
01:33:40,521 --> 01:33:41,955
What do you mean?

750
01:33:41,979 --> 01:33:44,414
Pilar was diagnosed bipolar.

751
01:33:44,438 --> 01:33:47,830
Oh my God! Very sad. Terrible.

752
01:33:47,854 --> 01:33:52,563
I heard that she ran outside
naked like a maniac

753
01:33:53,771 --> 01:33:57,039
believing that she was the Messiah,
shouting nonsense like that.

754
01:33:57,063 --> 01:33:58,997
That's awful.

755
01:33:59,021 --> 01:34:02,479
- Do you think it's hereditary?
- I hope not.

756
01:34:43,104 --> 01:34:44,938
Bravo...

757
01:34:46,771 --> 01:34:48,438
To Emy!

758
01:34:59,979 --> 01:35:02,080
They're looking for you upstairs.

759
01:35:02,104 --> 01:35:03,313
I got bored.

760
01:35:16,313 --> 01:35:17,438
Fuck off!

761
01:35:31,896 --> 01:35:34,771
So are we going
for a walk afterwards?

762
01:35:50,438 --> 01:35:51,854
You don't want to?

763
01:36:06,979 --> 01:36:08,479
I'm going upstairs.

764
01:36:39,479 --> 01:36:40,729
Sister.

765
01:36:42,063 --> 01:36:43,729
What are you doing here?

766
01:36:45,938 --> 01:36:47,771
It's quite a party.

767
01:36:49,146 --> 01:36:50,771
Why are you here?

768
01:36:51,313 --> 01:36:55,771
Emy, come with me, let's go home.

769
01:36:58,896 --> 01:37:00,563
Isn't this what you wanted?

770
01:37:04,896 --> 01:37:06,229
Emy, come with me.

771
01:37:07,313 --> 01:37:08,479
Emy.

772
01:37:08,896 --> 01:37:10,289
Now?

773
01:37:10,313 --> 01:37:11,313
Yes, now.

774
01:37:59,271 --> 01:38:01,313
Teresa, why are we here?

775
01:38:01,896 --> 01:38:03,354
We won't be long.

776
01:38:09,477 --> 01:38:11,411
Hail Mary, full of grace,
the Lord is with thee.

777
01:38:11,436 --> 01:38:13,870
Blessed art Thou among women, and
blessed is the fruit of Thy womb, Jesus.

778
01:38:13,894 --> 01:38:18,039
Holy Mary, Mother of God,
pray for us sinners now

779
01:38:18,063 --> 01:38:21,771
and at the hour of death. Amen.

780
01:38:23,063 --> 01:38:24,455
I want to go.

781
01:38:24,479 --> 01:38:26,938
Teresa, are you still in pain?

782
01:38:27,854 --> 01:38:30,146
Emy, you have to do this for your sister.

783
01:38:31,771 --> 01:38:34,789
Bless us, use us,
cover us with Your Holy Spirit,

784
01:38:34,813 --> 01:38:37,039
please purify me Lord,

785
01:38:37,063 --> 01:38:42,622
mold me, fill me with yourself, use me,

786
01:38:42,646 --> 01:38:46,622
Holy spirit banish all the forces
of evil from me,

787
01:38:46,646 --> 01:38:51,830
destroy them, vanquish them so that I be
healthy and do good deeds. Amen.

788
01:38:51,854 --> 01:38:54,122
Emy, accept the Lord. Say Amen.

789
01:38:54,146 --> 01:38:56,521
Emy, say Amen.

790
01:39:01,021 --> 01:39:03,580
Do this for me.
Do it for my child.

791
01:39:03,604 --> 01:39:06,938
I do everything for you.
Why are you doing this to me?

792
01:39:07,979 --> 01:39:11,271
Please continue, go on.

793
01:39:12,188 --> 01:39:17,497
Emy, do you deny the devil
and all evil spirits?

794
01:39:17,521 --> 01:39:19,747
Emy, answer! Emy!

795
01:39:19,771 --> 01:39:21,580
Yes she does.

796
01:39:21,604 --> 01:39:23,039
- Brother.
- Emy say the words!

797
01:39:23,063 --> 01:39:24,354
Go ahead, brother.

798
01:39:26,354 --> 01:39:28,372
Emy, blow them away!

799
01:39:28,396 --> 01:39:30,205
Praise the Lord.

800
01:39:30,229 --> 01:39:32,313
Renounce them. Let them leave your body.

801
01:39:34,813 --> 01:39:36,830
Sister, blow them away!

802
01:39:36,854 --> 01:39:39,146
Let them leave your body.

803
01:39:42,979 --> 01:39:46,080
Emy, blow it out. Blow it out.
Let it get out of your body.

804
01:39:46,104 --> 01:39:48,771
It's not the devil.

805
01:39:49,354 --> 01:39:51,563
I need them to go away.

806
01:39:52,188 --> 01:39:55,955
Do it for your sister, Emy.

807
01:39:55,979 --> 01:39:58,330
Do it to me. Help my baby.

808
01:39:58,354 --> 01:40:01,313
Please, Linda, me too.
I'm begging you, save my child.

809
01:40:01,729 --> 01:40:04,705
Sister, I beg you.

810
01:40:04,729 --> 01:40:06,664
Teresa! Teresa!

811
01:40:06,688 --> 01:40:09,104
Please.

812
01:40:09,813 --> 01:40:13,955
I want to get rid of
all the bad spirits in me.

813
01:40:13,979 --> 01:40:16,229
I am not the devil.

814
01:40:18,146 --> 01:40:19,771
Help me!

815
01:40:32,021 --> 01:40:34,563
- Help me, I'm begging you.
- Teresa!

816
01:40:36,896 --> 01:40:41,104
Please, continue, go on.
I'm begging you, Linda.

817
01:40:41,813 --> 01:40:44,747
- We need to go to the hospital, Teresa!
- Come on, Teresa.

818
01:40:44,771 --> 01:40:47,688
- Brother.
- We need to go to the hospital, Teresa.

819
01:40:49,063 --> 01:40:53,247
Teresa, you need to get out of there.
We have to go to the hospital.

820
01:40:53,271 --> 01:40:56,563
Careful. Step.

821
01:41:31,146 --> 01:41:34,938
Take a deep breath. Push.

822
01:41:36,188 --> 01:41:37,664
Breathe.

823
01:41:37,688 --> 01:41:40,646
- You're doing very well.
- Push hard.

824
01:41:45,188 --> 01:41:46,479
Well done.

825
01:41:50,313 --> 01:41:51,521
It's a boy.

826
01:41:53,021 --> 01:41:54,455
Let me see him.

827
01:41:54,479 --> 01:41:56,229
Calm down.

828
01:42:00,438 --> 01:42:02,438
Give her a sedative to calm down.

829
01:42:03,396 --> 01:42:06,438
- What do we do with the baby?
- Prepare for resuscitation, quick!

830
01:42:07,479 --> 01:42:09,729
- Should I give oxygen?
- Immediately!

831
01:42:14,354 --> 01:42:17,354
Come with me. I'm giving oxygen now.

832
01:42:21,313 --> 01:42:23,438
It still hurts a lot.

833
01:42:29,396 --> 01:42:31,521
What is going on? Is he alright?

834
01:42:33,229 --> 01:42:35,396
Everybody, come help with the baby!

835
01:42:38,521 --> 01:42:40,039
It hurts a lot.

836
01:42:40,063 --> 01:42:41,563
Stiches.

837
01:42:43,979 --> 01:42:45,563
Why is he not crying?

838
01:42:46,063 --> 01:42:47,313
Calm down.

839
01:42:47,896 --> 01:42:49,896
What's going on? Is he okay?

840
01:42:53,188 --> 01:42:55,354
Don't do this to me.

841
01:42:57,979 --> 01:42:59,771
Please, go outside!

842
01:43:06,438 --> 01:43:08,729
It's different in my dreams.

843
01:43:34,354 --> 01:43:36,479
You have to give him to me now.

844
01:43:40,521 --> 01:43:41,521
Come on.

845
01:43:49,146 --> 01:43:50,313
What are you doing?

846
01:43:51,354 --> 01:43:53,914
- What is she doing? Stop her!
- Give me the baby!

847
01:43:53,938 --> 01:43:57,104
- Give me the baby! Take it easy.
- What's going on? Take it from her!

848
01:43:58,396 --> 01:44:01,080
Doctor! Doctor!

849
01:44:01,104 --> 01:44:03,372
Please, calm down.
Everything is alright.

850
01:44:03,396 --> 01:44:05,563
I won't do anything.
Just give me the baby.

851
01:45:32,104 --> 01:45:33,979
You didn't want to be with us?

852
01:45:34,729 --> 01:45:36,771
It's not your choice to make.

853
01:45:41,938 --> 01:45:44,563
Stop. It's ticklish.

854
01:45:52,646 --> 01:45:56,438
Thank you, Emy, thank you.

855
01:45:58,438 --> 01:46:00,479
Thank you, God.
