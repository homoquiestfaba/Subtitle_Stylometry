00:04:03,025 --> 00:04:04,679
On your face, motherfucker!

40
00:04:04,722 --> 00:04:06,724
- Hey, let's go!
- Hands behind your back!

41
00:04:08,204 --> 00:04:11,512
Hey! Don't go
postal on us!

42
00:04:15,342 --> 00:04:17,169
Billy Raedeen?

43
00:04:23,350 --> 00:04:26,091
How was your weekend?

44
00:04:27,789 --> 00:04:30,444
- Something amuse you, Mr. Raedeen?
- No, sir.

45
00:04:30,487 --> 00:04:33,098
You've been caught in the
commission of a federal crime,

46
00:04:33,142 --> 00:04:35,405
punishable to the fullest
extent of the law.

47
00:04:35,449 --> 00:04:37,364
Do you understand what that means?

48
00:04:37,407 --> 00:04:40,584
- No, but if I could explain...
- your arrest record speaks for itself.

49
00:04:40,628 --> 00:04:43,152
It starts at age nine,
with car theft.

50
00:04:43,195 --> 00:04:44,849
"Backhoe," sir.

51
00:04:44,893 --> 00:04:48,070
- I keep trying to correct that.
- Was it stolen?

52
00:04:48,113 --> 00:04:49,463
No, the keys were in it.

53
00:04:49,506 --> 00:04:52,335
Like the liquor store in '83?

54
00:04:52,379 --> 00:04:54,381
The Buick Skylark in '84?

55
00:04:54,424 --> 00:04:56,774
The K-Mart in '86,
the motorcycle in '88,

56
00:04:56,818 --> 00:04:58,298
the pharmacy in '89, not to mention

57
00:04:58,341 --> 00:05:01,126
what looks like dozens of drug possession,

58
00:05:01,170 --> 00:05:02,780
public vagrancy charges,

59
00:05:02,824 --> 00:05:04,782
topped off by breaking
and entering

60
00:05:04,826 --> 00:05:06,958
a United States post office last night?

61
00:05:07,002 --> 00:05:10,005
- We did have the keys.
- I can vouch for that!

62
00:05:10,048 --> 00:05:13,051
- And we did not steal nothin'.
- Nope.

63
00:05:13,095 --> 00:05:15,227
- Who is this man?
- We was readin' the mail.

64
00:05:15,271 --> 00:05:17,578
- Quiet!
- Step forward.

65
00:05:17,621 --> 00:05:19,928
Me?

66
00:05:19,971 --> 00:05:23,018
Buford Dill?
Alias Buford Hill?

67
00:05:23,061 --> 00:05:24,933
Alias...

68
00:05:24,976 --> 00:05:27,892
Meyer Gottnich?

69
00:05:27,936 --> 00:05:29,416
No, no, no, sir.

70
00:05:29,459 --> 00:05:33,942
I was trying to say,
"my, I got an itch."

71
00:05:35,639 --> 00:05:39,600
A rectal...
Rectal situation, sir.

72
00:05:39,643 --> 00:05:42,211
Quite acute.
Got a prescription drug.

73
00:05:42,254 --> 00:05:45,127
- Is this man sober?
- As a judge, your honor.

74
00:05:48,826 --> 00:05:50,567
Quiet!

75
00:05:50,611 --> 00:05:53,396
See, your honor,
my friend here works as a mail carrier,

76
00:05:53,440 --> 00:05:56,399
and he come across this photo
of a bulldog in a wedding dress.

77
00:05:56,443 --> 00:05:58,227
We had a couple of beers,

78
00:05:58,270 --> 00:06:00,708
a couple, and we got curious.

79
00:06:00,751 --> 00:06:03,493
God is my witness, your honor...

80
00:06:04,538 --> 00:06:06,627
It looked like...

81
00:06:06,670 --> 00:06:10,544
The ugliest bride!
Every man's nightmare.

82
00:06:10,587 --> 00:06:13,895
My wife come,
by the way? Tess?

83
00:06:13,938 --> 00:06:16,158
- Did you call her?
- We did, your honor.

84
00:06:16,201 --> 00:06:17,638
And what she say?

85
00:06:17,681 --> 00:06:20,292
- With the court's permission?
- And?

86
00:06:20,336 --> 00:06:23,121
She said, "screw him."

87
00:06:30,781 --> 00:06:32,957
Out of 27 arrests between you,

88
00:06:33,001 --> 00:06:36,004
19 have been together,
and I'm putting an end to it.

89
00:06:36,047 --> 00:06:38,746
I'm recommending
10-year minimum sentences

90
00:06:38,789 --> 00:06:40,356
in separate facilities

91
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,532
at opposite ends of the state,

92
00:06:42,576 --> 00:06:44,665
any precondition
for parole being

93
00:06:44,708 --> 00:06:47,276
that you never
see each other again.

94
00:06:47,319 --> 00:06:49,974
You're allowed to make a statement.
You have one?

95
00:06:54,414 --> 00:06:56,764
I took care of him all his life.

96
00:06:56,807 --> 00:06:58,983
You've done
a piss-poor job of it.

97
00:06:59,027 --> 00:07:01,029
He's a loser, just like you,

98
00:07:01,072 --> 00:07:02,944
who'll never amount
to anything more

99
00:07:02,987 --> 00:07:06,991
than a burden to the decent,
hardworking taxpayers of this state.

100
00:07:07,035 --> 00:07:08,210
You have anything to say?

101
00:07:12,519 --> 00:07:14,695
Just that you're wrong, sir.

102
00:07:14,738 --> 00:07:17,306
I will amount to something.

103
00:07:19,830 --> 00:07:21,571
Not me.

104
00:07:21,615 --> 00:07:24,052
I'll be like you said.

105
00:07:24,095 --> 00:07:26,620
Get them out of here.

106
00:07:33,409 --> 00:07:35,803
"Screw him!"

107
00:07:37,587 --> 00:07:41,199
- What did you say?
- Screw him!

108
00:07:42,418 --> 00:07:45,160
Maybe I oughta stuff
that laugh down your throat.

109
00:07:45,203 --> 00:07:48,206
- What?
- Bue, we're in enough trouble.

110
00:07:48,250 --> 00:07:50,644
I ain't having no Indian
making fun of my wife.

111
00:07:50,650 --> 00:07:51,993
She ain't even your wife.

112
00:07:52,036 --> 00:07:54,648
- You want to do something about it?
- That's mighty great,

113
00:07:54,691 --> 00:07:57,520
seeing as both my hands
is tied up in chains.

114
00:07:57,564 --> 00:07:59,827
Hey, hey!

115
00:07:59,870 --> 00:08:02,307
- Hey, get off him!
- Take the keys!

116
00:08:02,351 --> 00:08:05,049
Get the keys!
The keys!

117
00:08:05,093 --> 00:08:06,964
- Get the keys!
- In the van!

118
00:08:07,008 --> 00:08:09,053
Get in the van!

119
00:08:10,794 --> 00:08:12,361
Whoa!

120
00:08:12,404 --> 00:08:14,581
Keys! Keys!

121
00:08:16,452 --> 00:08:18,323
Bue, here! Here!

122
00:08:21,239 --> 00:08:23,459
Come on, bue!
Get them, bue!

123
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:25,853
- Come on, come on!
- I'm coming!

124
00:08:25,896 --> 00:08:27,594
I'm tied up, man!

125
00:08:27,637 --> 00:08:30,118
Billy, Cactus Pie!

126
00:08:30,161 --> 00:08:32,120
Cactus Pie!

127
00:08:32,163 --> 00:08:34,557
Bue!

128
00:08:34,601 --> 00:08:36,559
- Bue!
- Cactus Pie!

129
00:08:36,603 --> 00:08:39,127
- Cactus Pie?!
- Yeah!

130
00:09:00,017 --> 00:09:02,803
Dear little Loozy,

131
00:09:02,846 --> 00:09:05,022
I'm writing a letter to you
in my mind,

132
00:09:05,066 --> 00:09:06,589
which I will memorize

133
00:09:06,633 --> 00:09:08,983
until I find some paper
to write it down on.

134
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:14,466
I've written many
such letters in the past,

135
00:09:14,510 --> 00:09:16,381
which are filed away in my mind,

136
00:09:16,425 --> 00:09:18,993
to be summoned up word for word,

137
00:09:19,036 --> 00:09:20,908
written down on paper,
and mailed

138
00:09:20,951 --> 00:09:23,693
to the appropriate person,
at the appropriate time.

139
00:09:24,999 --> 00:09:27,175
It's called
a photographic memory,

140
00:09:27,218 --> 00:09:31,048
and to this point
it's failed me completely.

141
00:09:33,660 --> 00:09:35,792
But this letter I'll remember

142
00:09:35,836 --> 00:09:38,578
because it's the most
important one.

143
00:09:38,621 --> 00:09:41,972
It'll explain your origins
on this planet earth.

144
00:09:42,016 --> 00:09:45,106
- Who I was when we first met,

145
00:09:45,149 --> 00:09:48,065
and how everything came to be.

146
00:09:53,027 --> 00:09:54,637
Hey!

147
00:09:54,681 --> 00:09:57,597
Can you fix a tire?
I'll give you a ride.

148
00:09:57,640 --> 00:09:59,468
Where ya headed?

149
00:10:02,384 --> 00:10:04,647
You sure you got room?

150
00:10:04,691 --> 00:10:06,649
One hand washes the other, pal.

151
00:10:06,693 --> 00:10:08,869
This one opens the trunk.

152
00:10:20,707 --> 00:10:23,274
- Hey!
- Don't let nothing fall out of there.

153
00:10:23,318 --> 00:10:26,669
I'm deducting 10 miles
for everything out of place.

154
00:10:34,068 --> 00:10:35,635
Here ya go!

155
00:10:37,854 --> 00:10:39,856
- Bye-bye!
- Hey!

156
00:10:52,695 --> 00:10:55,219
It's a story
about fate, dear one.

157
00:10:55,263 --> 00:10:57,744
How no one can outrun it.

158
00:10:57,787 --> 00:11:00,790
Like The Dog once said,
"you can change your ground,

159
00:11:00,834 --> 00:11:03,227
but you can't change
your sky."

160
00:11:04,446 --> 00:11:07,188
Though I hadn't met
The Dog yet, he was right.

161
00:11:07,231 --> 00:11:10,670
'Cause that night the ground
was moving fast beneath me,

162
00:11:10,713 --> 00:11:13,803
but the sky was standing still.

163
00:11:15,022 --> 00:11:17,807
I also shared a dream
with Buford that night,

164
00:11:17,851 --> 00:11:20,288
like I had on occasion
over the many years

165
00:11:20,331 --> 00:11:22,072
we shared a jail cell.

166
00:11:22,116 --> 00:11:25,685
I knew it was his dream because
the woman in it was Tess,

167
00:11:25,728 --> 00:11:27,774
like he always talked
about her...

168
00:11:27,817 --> 00:11:29,689
Naked.

169
00:12:27,050 --> 00:12:29,052
Hey!

170
00:12:29,096 --> 00:12:31,968
Hey, call the police!
Call the ambulance!

171
00:12:32,012 --> 00:12:34,579
- Get out!
- I'm outta here! I'm not insured.

172
00:12:34,623 --> 00:12:36,364
- Call somebody!
- Forget it!

173
00:13:09,571 --> 00:13:11,094
Oh shit! Hey!

174
00:13:13,053 --> 00:13:17,100
Oh Lordie, this is bad!

175
00:13:50,264 --> 00:13:53,963
Hey, little guy.
I'm Billy.

176
00:13:54,007 --> 00:13:56,009
Let's get you out of here, huh?

177
00:13:59,273 --> 00:14:01,579
Oh!

178
00:14:03,930 --> 00:14:06,062
You're gonna be
all right, ma'am.

179
00:14:06,106 --> 00:14:08,935
We're gonna get you outta here.

180
00:14:08,978 --> 00:14:12,155
Believe me, I know it looks
bad, but it's gonna...

181
00:14:12,199 --> 00:14:14,897
It's gonna get just
a little bit worse.

182
00:14:14,941 --> 00:14:16,725
Would you wait here, please?

183
00:14:42,229 --> 00:14:44,231
Bye, ma'am.

184
00:15:11,127 --> 00:15:14,565
Buford would later say
my ass was a lethal weapon.

185
00:15:14,609 --> 00:15:16,959
I mooned a family and...

186
00:15:17,003 --> 00:15:19,353
Moments later, they were dead.

187
00:15:19,396 --> 00:15:21,572
Jesus, kid!

188
00:15:21,616 --> 00:15:24,836
I soon learned that my ass
wasn't the only lethal weapon.

189
00:15:38,285 --> 00:15:40,940
Oh, that's nasty.

190
00:15:58,131 --> 00:16:00,307
Don't you shit in my Megadeth.

191
00:16:07,749 --> 00:16:10,186
One of the things
about that night was

192
00:16:10,230 --> 00:16:13,450
it wasn't the first night
I've been shit out of luck,

193
00:16:13,494 --> 00:16:17,585
hungry, cold, wet, and alone.

194
00:16:20,109 --> 00:16:21,589
Now, now,

195
00:16:21,632 --> 00:16:24,070
it's all right.

196
00:16:24,113 --> 00:16:26,072
It's just Wile E. Coyote.

197
00:16:26,115 --> 00:16:29,510
It was the first such night
I didn't feel lonely.

198
00:16:29,553 --> 00:16:31,338
Beep beep!

199
00:16:34,732 --> 00:16:36,038
Beep beep!

200
00:16:36,082 --> 00:16:38,301
You ever see them cartoons?

201
00:16:46,962 --> 00:16:48,964
Yes! Yeah!

202
00:17:26,784 --> 00:17:29,178
Another thing
about fate, dear one,

203
00:17:29,222 --> 00:17:31,311
the people who change it,

204
00:17:31,354 --> 00:17:34,444
seem to appear by accident.

205
00:17:34,488 --> 00:17:36,533
That's how we met Shauna-Louise.

206
00:17:36,577 --> 00:17:38,274
Loozy for short.

207
00:17:38,318 --> 00:17:40,233
A name you'll have reason
to remember

208
00:17:40,276 --> 00:17:42,148
for the rest of your life.

209
00:17:48,154 --> 00:17:51,853
- You open?
- Just barely.

210
00:17:51,896 --> 00:17:53,594
You got food?

211
00:17:53,637 --> 00:17:55,770
I wouldn't advise the burgers,

212
00:17:55,813 --> 00:17:57,511
our refrigeration broke down

213
00:17:57,554 --> 00:18:01,297
- except for the cold drink case.
- That's real pretty.

214
00:18:01,341 --> 00:18:03,647
Our pie's all right.

215
00:18:03,691 --> 00:18:05,388
That sounds good.

216
00:18:06,650 --> 00:18:08,522
So what about kangaroo?

217
00:18:10,132 --> 00:18:12,047
Kangaroo?

218
00:18:12,091 --> 00:18:14,484
In your pouch?

219
00:18:14,528 --> 00:18:17,139
Oh!

220
00:18:18,314 --> 00:18:20,621
Pie, I guess.

221
00:18:20,664 --> 00:18:22,144
No?

222
00:18:23,145 --> 00:18:25,800
- I would think milk.
- Make it two.

223
00:18:25,843 --> 00:18:28,019
Do you want it warmed?

224
00:18:28,063 --> 00:18:31,284
Yeah, that would be good.
Pie and warm milk, guy?

225
00:18:31,327 --> 00:18:33,024
Sit anywhere you like.

226
00:18:44,775 --> 00:18:46,908
Come on, catch it.

227
00:18:46,951 --> 00:18:48,692
Come on, you can catch... yeah.

228
00:18:48,736 --> 00:18:51,173
Here it comes.
Almost.

229
00:18:54,568 --> 00:18:56,309
He's going to be
a baseball player.

230
00:18:56,352 --> 00:18:59,312
- If he ever learns to catch.
- Is that right?

231
00:18:59,355 --> 00:19:01,140
Got to grow up
big and strong, though.

232
00:19:09,017 --> 00:19:11,150
Oh!

233
00:19:13,282 --> 00:19:16,981
You normally use utensils
with that baby?

234
00:19:17,025 --> 00:19:19,810
It's never too early
to learn manners, I say.

235
00:19:21,595 --> 00:19:23,553
Why don't you try
using your fingers?

236
00:19:23,597 --> 00:19:26,643
Babies that age like to suck.

237
00:19:28,471 --> 00:19:30,343
All right.

238
00:19:38,220 --> 00:19:40,135
I'll tell you what,
when I woke up this morning,

239
00:19:40,179 --> 00:19:42,877
I had no idea this would be
the result of my day.

240
00:19:42,920 --> 00:19:45,227
Yeah, my friend just had one.

241
00:19:45,271 --> 00:19:48,709
Says they can suck so hard
they make your insides curl up.

242
00:19:55,585 --> 00:19:58,545
- Say, who's baby is this?
- This baby?

243
00:19:58,588 --> 00:20:00,938
- Mine.
- Yeah?

244
00:20:00,982 --> 00:20:02,113
- Yeah.
- Where's the mother?

245
00:20:02,157 --> 00:20:04,115
Oh, that's...

246
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,379
That's a whole other problem.

247
00:20:06,422 --> 00:20:08,729
What, she took off?

248
00:20:08,772 --> 00:20:11,122
In the end there,

249
00:20:11,166 --> 00:20:13,124
I actually think she did.

250
00:20:13,168 --> 00:20:15,866
Well, that's too bad.

251
00:20:15,910 --> 00:20:17,738
That baby needs a breast.

252
00:20:17,781 --> 00:20:19,522
A bottle, anyways.

253
00:20:19,566 --> 00:20:21,872
He's not gonna get
enough milk like that.

254
00:20:23,787 --> 00:20:25,311
Come here, here you go.

255
00:20:25,354 --> 00:20:27,835
Here you go.
Come on guy.

256
00:20:27,878 --> 00:20:29,793
You can do it.

257
00:20:32,448 --> 00:20:34,189
Oh no, I wouldn't do that.

258
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,933
Here. Come on.

259
00:20:38,976 --> 00:20:41,718
Hey, hey.

260
00:20:41,762 --> 00:20:43,981
- You are hopeless.
- I agree.

261
00:20:44,025 --> 00:20:46,723
Any idea where I can get
one of them bottles?

262
00:20:46,767 --> 00:20:48,812
There's an all-night
market in Henderson.

263
00:20:48,856 --> 00:20:52,468
- I got no car.
- You've got no car?

264
00:20:52,512 --> 00:20:54,775
Or money. Sorry.

265
00:20:54,818 --> 00:20:57,517
You walk around
in the middle of the night

266
00:20:57,560 --> 00:20:59,475
with a baby tucked
into your pants,

267
00:20:59,519 --> 00:21:01,869
you got no food for it,
no money, no mother,

268
00:21:01,912 --> 00:21:03,740
no bottle, no car?!

269
00:21:03,784 --> 00:21:06,221
You are one sorry-ass mess!

270
00:21:06,265 --> 00:21:08,136
I would have to agree.

271
00:21:08,179 --> 00:21:09,746
Shh, come on.

272
00:21:12,445 --> 00:21:14,838
He likes me to hold him.

273
00:21:14,882 --> 00:21:18,102
- God knows why.
- Hey.

274
00:21:23,194 --> 00:21:25,980
- All right, what's your name?
- Billy Raedeen.

275
00:21:26,023 --> 00:21:28,025
Well, you listen to me,
Billy Raedeen.

276
00:21:28,069 --> 00:21:30,201
I don't let any man in my car
I don't know,

277
00:21:30,245 --> 00:21:31,681
except for the sake
of this baby.

278
00:21:31,725 --> 00:21:33,727
- If you turn out to be bad guy...
- now...

279
00:21:33,770 --> 00:21:36,207
How could I be a bad guy, huh?

280
00:21:37,644 --> 00:21:40,168
- Exactly.
- That's what I'm thinking.

281
00:21:40,211 --> 00:21:42,605
Babies can't be that stupid.

282
00:22:05,846 --> 00:22:08,979
Dog once told me
the journey of 1000 miles

283
00:22:09,023 --> 00:22:11,025
begins with a single step.

284
00:22:11,068 --> 00:22:13,157
He was right again.

285
00:22:13,201 --> 00:22:16,204
'Cause all I'd intended
was to find Buford that day,

286
00:22:16,247 --> 00:22:18,380
but by nightfall...

287
00:22:19,599 --> 00:22:22,123
My entire world was changing.

288
00:22:23,254 --> 00:22:24,604
Big!

289
00:22:24,647 --> 00:22:27,041
Yup. It belonged
to the guy

290
00:22:27,084 --> 00:22:29,348
who knocked her up,
may he rot in hell.

291
00:22:29,391 --> 00:22:31,393
He's a rodeo cowboy.

292
00:22:31,437 --> 00:22:33,830
Is she up this hour?

293
00:22:33,874 --> 00:22:36,703
She works at clubs,
she doesn't get home till now.

294
00:22:36,746 --> 00:22:38,313
- It's me.
- It's open.

295
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:40,968
- Hey, Loozy!
- I'll take another.

296
00:22:41,011 --> 00:22:44,363
Hit me.
Hit me!

297
00:22:46,365 --> 00:22:48,323
Verne was here.

298
00:22:48,367 --> 00:22:50,194
Oh, yeah?

299
00:22:50,238 --> 00:22:52,371
Yeah, in his usual
cheerful mood.

300
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,285
- He kicked Jack.
- And then, what,

301
00:22:54,329 --> 00:22:57,680
- do I go face up?
- No, not unless he splits.

302
00:22:57,724 --> 00:22:59,856
- Oh.
- I'm teaching her to deal.

303
00:22:59,900 --> 00:23:01,554
Uh-huh, something
to fall back on.

304
00:23:01,597 --> 00:23:03,207
What did he say?

305
00:23:03,251 --> 00:23:05,384
That I don't kick high enough.

306
00:23:05,427 --> 00:23:07,168
Can you believe
that little faggot?

307
00:23:07,211 --> 00:23:09,997
- He's laying the groundwork to fire me.
- No, I mean Verne.

308
00:23:10,040 --> 00:23:13,217
- Was he angry?
- Verne, angry?

309
00:23:19,441 --> 00:23:21,138
Well, hi there.

310
00:23:21,182 --> 00:23:24,315
This is Billy Rayburn.

311
00:23:24,359 --> 00:23:26,317
Estelle, Stormy,

312
00:23:26,361 --> 00:23:28,232
Dog Havasu.

313
00:23:28,276 --> 00:23:30,670
- Raedeen.
- Hi.

314
00:23:30,713 --> 00:23:31,671
- Hey.
- Hi.

315
00:23:31,714 --> 00:23:34,717
His baby needs some milk.

316
00:23:36,545 --> 00:23:40,419
The mother took off.
They've been on the road all night.

317
00:23:40,462 --> 00:23:42,986
It's gone.
I tossed it.

318
00:23:43,030 --> 00:23:44,727
The formula?

319
00:23:44,771 --> 00:23:46,207
The pampers, the bottles,

320
00:23:46,250 --> 00:23:47,817
the formula.
All of it.

321
00:23:47,861 --> 00:23:49,602
Why?

322
00:23:49,645 --> 00:23:51,386
Why not?

323
00:23:51,430 --> 00:23:54,389
I don't know,
maybe someone could use it.

324
00:23:57,697 --> 00:24:00,439
I'm supposed to know you're
dragging in a guy with a baby

325
00:24:00,482 --> 00:24:01,527
in the middle of the night?

326
00:24:01,570 --> 00:24:04,486
What am I, a mind-reader?

327
00:24:04,530 --> 00:24:06,836
- I got to go.
- You toss it in the garbage?

328
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:09,143
- It's gone.
- Shit!

329
00:24:09,186 --> 00:24:12,102
It does look kind of
pale, Estelle.

330
00:24:12,146 --> 00:24:13,582
What do you want from me?

331
00:24:13,626 --> 00:24:16,498
- What's it's name?
- Billy.

332
00:24:16,542 --> 00:24:19,458
You must give it a name
that means something.

333
00:24:19,501 --> 00:24:23,374
- I'll try to think of one.
- How about "thirsty one"?

334
00:24:25,072 --> 00:24:26,639
No, how about those?

335
00:24:30,817 --> 00:24:33,907
- Get out of here.
- You threw away the bottles.

336
00:24:33,950 --> 00:24:36,213
- Forget it.
- The lips are puckering.

337
00:24:36,257 --> 00:24:38,607
I'd pay for some, ma'am.

338
00:24:38,651 --> 00:24:40,914
- I really would.
- This is so fucked!

339
00:24:40,957 --> 00:24:43,133
Come on, Estelle.
What's the big deal?

340
00:24:43,177 --> 00:24:45,179
I'm not a milk cow
for fuck's sake.

341
00:24:45,222 --> 00:24:47,224
I'm taking...

342
00:24:48,617 --> 00:24:51,228
I'm taking medicine to dry up.

343
00:24:53,056 --> 00:24:55,798
It's not working.

344
00:24:55,842 --> 00:24:59,149
- I'd be much obliged.
- Why don't you shut up?

345
00:24:59,193 --> 00:25:01,064
Who the hell invited you
here anyway?

346
00:25:01,108 --> 00:25:03,240
Why don't you just shut up
and get out!

347
00:25:03,284 --> 00:25:05,155
Yes, ma'am.

348
00:25:06,330 --> 00:25:08,376
And give me the goddamn baby.

349
00:25:08,419 --> 00:25:10,247
Yes, ma'am. Here.

350
00:25:12,467 --> 00:25:13,947
Now get out.

351
00:25:16,166 --> 00:25:18,299
I said, get out.
All of you.

352
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:20,954
I'll stay.

353
00:25:32,879 --> 00:25:35,272
- I'm sorry.
- Forget it.

354
00:25:53,290 --> 00:25:54,422
Yeah.

355
00:25:54,465 --> 00:25:56,206
Well, good luck with your baby.

356
00:25:56,250 --> 00:25:58,252
- Good night.
- Right.

357
00:26:02,299 --> 00:26:04,301
Thanks.

358
00:26:19,273 --> 00:26:21,449
The, uh...

359
00:26:21,492 --> 00:26:24,060
The old guy.
He's... he's her...?

360
00:26:24,104 --> 00:26:26,062
Mine.

361
00:26:26,106 --> 00:26:28,456
He's my old guy.

362
00:26:29,283 --> 00:26:31,328
And the fella who drove in?

363
00:26:33,287 --> 00:26:35,419
You know, when you live
this close to people,

364
00:26:35,463 --> 00:26:38,553
you mind your own business.

365
00:26:39,685 --> 00:26:43,340
Which reminds me,
I got to find a place.

366
00:26:44,254 --> 00:26:46,387
For the night, anyway.

367
00:26:51,305 --> 00:26:54,351
Well, no one's come
to claim that one yet.

368
00:26:54,395 --> 00:26:57,485
They found a couple dead in it.

369
00:26:59,356 --> 00:27:02,142
Looks like a dream house to me.

370
00:27:02,185 --> 00:27:05,406
We all got our dreams.

371
00:27:05,449 --> 00:27:07,843
Yeah? You?

372
00:27:09,453 --> 00:27:12,369
- Oh, yeah.
- What?

373
00:27:14,241 --> 00:27:17,461
I want to help Dog build
a tepee out of bottle caps.

374
00:27:20,856 --> 00:27:22,815
We spend our weekends
collecting them.

375
00:27:22,858 --> 00:27:24,947
No kiddin'?
That... that's great.

376
00:27:24,991 --> 00:27:27,341
I'll keep an eye out.
As much beer as I drink,

377
00:27:27,384 --> 00:27:29,822
you could build
the empire state building.

378
00:27:42,878 --> 00:27:46,186
What happened to her baby?
Estelle?

379
00:27:49,102 --> 00:27:50,581
She gave it away.

380
00:27:50,625 --> 00:27:52,409
Why?

381
00:27:52,453 --> 00:27:55,369
What's she got to give a baby?

382
00:28:01,810 --> 00:28:03,899
Cactus Pie!

383
00:28:03,943 --> 00:28:06,119
- Bue, is that you?!
- Hang on.

384
00:28:07,511 --> 00:28:09,470
- Yeah?
- Bue?

385
00:28:09,513 --> 00:28:12,255
Hey, Billy boy!

386
00:28:12,299 --> 00:28:13,474
You made it!

387
00:28:13,517 --> 00:28:16,259
- Across the Nevada line.
- All right!

388
00:28:16,303 --> 00:28:19,741
- I got a baby, Buford.
- Hey, good going!

389
00:28:19,785 --> 00:28:21,482
Where did you score it?

390
00:28:21,525 --> 00:28:24,920
- I don't know what to do with it.
- Is it a good one?

391
00:28:26,139 --> 00:28:29,229
- What do you mean?
- What do you think, man?

392
00:28:29,272 --> 00:28:31,405
Ransom.

393
00:28:31,448 --> 00:28:33,755
Oh, no, no, no.
Not this one, bue.

394
00:28:33,799 --> 00:28:36,366
- Why not?
- It's got no folks.

395
00:28:36,410 --> 00:28:38,412
There's got to be
someone who wants it.

396
00:28:38,455 --> 00:28:40,283
You didn't.
I didn't.

397
00:28:40,327 --> 00:28:42,242
Why, is it ugly?

398
00:28:42,285 --> 00:28:44,244
No, it's not ugly
at all, Buford.

399
00:28:44,287 --> 00:28:46,768
Well, there you are.
That's a start.

400
00:28:46,812 --> 00:28:48,770
We'll make something out of it.

401
00:28:48,814 --> 00:28:52,426
- Where are you?
- Henderson trailer park.

402
00:28:52,469 --> 00:28:56,082
Henderson, that's out by Tess.

403
00:28:56,125 --> 00:28:57,866
Check your bus schedule, boy.

404
00:28:57,910 --> 00:29:00,434
- I'm on my way!
- All right.

405
00:29:00,477 --> 00:29:02,088
Hey, I got us a place though.

406
00:29:02,131 --> 00:29:05,221
Two people died in it.

407
00:29:05,265 --> 00:29:07,180
Bue?

408
00:29:17,843 --> 00:29:19,801
Stupid dog!

409
00:29:19,845 --> 00:29:21,803
I'm sick of this shit!

410
00:29:23,283 --> 00:29:25,241
Don't you ever push me!

411
00:29:25,285 --> 00:29:27,896
If you would just
go get it, all right?!

412
00:29:39,386 --> 00:29:42,389
Louise, get up.
I'm not going to hurt you.

413
00:29:47,133 --> 00:29:49,396
They will make love now.

414
00:29:49,439 --> 00:29:51,528
Jesus.

415
00:29:54,531 --> 00:29:56,490
Your son.
The thirsty one.

416
00:29:56,533 --> 00:29:58,797
- He was in an accident?
- Why?

417
00:29:58,840 --> 00:30:01,712
She opened his pants
to clean him,

418
00:30:01,756 --> 00:30:04,367
- and found the injury.
- What injury?

419
00:30:04,411 --> 00:30:06,369
- The bruise.
- Well, how bad?

420
00:30:07,718 --> 00:30:11,287
- His penis came off.
- What?

421
00:30:11,331 --> 00:30:14,638
Either that,
or he never had one.

422
00:30:19,730 --> 00:30:22,255
I don't know
what your story is, mister,

423
00:30:22,298 --> 00:30:25,345
but your son is a daughter.

424
00:30:25,388 --> 00:30:28,652
- What?
- Your boy is a girl.

425
00:30:30,306 --> 00:30:33,744
- It's a girl?
- Not a doubt in my mind.

426
00:30:34,920 --> 00:30:37,270
No wonder he couldn't catch.

427
00:30:38,532 --> 00:30:40,882
And so, sweet thirsty thing,

428
00:30:40,926 --> 00:30:44,407
I told strangers that night
how you came into my life.

429
00:30:44,451 --> 00:30:46,409
And that I was a wanted man,

430
00:30:46,453 --> 00:30:49,369
all by way of asking advice.

431
00:30:49,412 --> 00:30:50,761
The woman, Estelle,

432
00:30:50,805 --> 00:30:52,285
suggested I take you
to a hospital

433
00:30:52,328 --> 00:30:54,287
and run away real quick,

434
00:30:54,330 --> 00:30:57,377
or leave you on the steps of the
church in the desert, nearby.

435
00:30:58,769 --> 00:31:00,119
And the man called Dog,

436
00:31:00,162 --> 00:31:02,295
who was a trained
satellite dish installer,

437
00:31:02,338 --> 00:31:05,907
and dreamed of making the world's
first tepee out of bottle caps,

438
00:31:05,951 --> 00:31:09,084
said he'd consult
with his spiritual advisors.

439
00:31:28,538 --> 00:31:31,106
But I was thinking
Buford was right.

440
00:31:31,150 --> 00:31:34,327
Everybody's got to have
somebody who wants them.

441
00:31:35,502 --> 00:31:38,635
And I determined to help you
find your own kin.

442
00:31:54,608 --> 00:31:58,525
Bus 64, final destination,
Palm Springs.

443
00:31:58,568 --> 00:32:02,485
It'll be ready
for boarding in 15 minutes.

444
00:32:02,529 --> 00:32:04,009
Hey.

445
00:32:05,010 --> 00:32:06,359
- Hey, bue.
- Hey.

446
00:32:06,402 --> 00:32:08,274
How you been?
Got any money?

447
00:32:08,317 --> 00:32:10,885
- What did you do?
- My asshole's itching so bad,

448
00:32:10,929 --> 00:32:12,887
I'm ready to take Brillo to it.

449
00:32:12,931 --> 00:32:16,325
- You going to see a doctor about that?
- I just need some chapstick.

450
00:32:16,369 --> 00:32:19,415
Hey, look! Look at that.
It's them.

451
00:32:19,459 --> 00:32:21,591
- Name and everything.
- You got any money?

452
00:32:21,635 --> 00:32:24,333
- Ma'am, you got any chapstick?
- Uh, sure.

453
00:32:24,377 --> 00:32:26,292
The car crash I pulled
the baby from,

454
00:32:26,335 --> 00:32:28,337
- but the weird thing is...
- We got cherry,

455
00:32:28,381 --> 00:32:30,513
- mint, strawberry...
- I don't give a damn.

456
00:32:30,557 --> 00:32:32,167
You will when it's on your lips.

457
00:32:32,211 --> 00:32:35,301
- Not on these lips.
- Car crash I pulled the baby from?

458
00:32:35,344 --> 00:32:37,303
Look at that,
it's them right there.

459
00:32:37,346 --> 00:32:40,132
Name and everything.
There you go.

460
00:32:40,175 --> 00:32:42,308
The weird thing is,
it says, "entire family,"

461
00:32:42,351 --> 00:32:44,310
but they don't mention the baby.

462
00:32:44,353 --> 00:32:47,226
Even the neighbors say,
"they were a lovely couple

463
00:32:47,269 --> 00:32:50,229
with a loving, beautiful
six-year-old daughter."

464
00:32:50,272 --> 00:32:52,144
A six-year-old daughter.

465
00:32:52,187 --> 00:32:53,580
Huh?!

466
00:32:53,623 --> 00:32:56,365
You used a whole one?

467
00:32:56,409 --> 00:32:58,759
Hold it between my cheeks.

468
00:32:58,802 --> 00:33:01,022
Feels better?

469
00:33:03,807 --> 00:33:05,461
Strawberry.

470
00:33:05,505 --> 00:33:07,681
No one's looking for this child.

471
00:33:07,724 --> 00:33:09,422
It's like this baby don't exist.

472
00:33:10,684 --> 00:33:13,904
- What baby?
- Oh, shit!

473
00:33:13,948 --> 00:33:16,777
No, no, miss!

474
00:33:16,820 --> 00:33:18,997
Oh, god. Thank you!

475
00:33:19,040 --> 00:33:21,390
- This your baby?
- Yeah, yeah, sorry.

476
00:33:21,434 --> 00:33:23,175
- Sorry my ass!
- Well, I had to...

477
00:33:23,218 --> 00:33:25,046
What in the hell
is wrong with you?

478
00:33:25,090 --> 00:33:28,223
Drugged out?
You dumb-shit motherfucker.

479
00:33:28,267 --> 00:33:30,660
Leave a little baby
on a bus bench like that.

480
00:33:30,704 --> 00:33:32,532
You ought to get
what you deserve,

481
00:33:32,575 --> 00:33:34,360
and have it stolen away
from you.

482
00:33:34,403 --> 00:33:36,449
You interested?
We're selling it.

483
00:33:36,492 --> 00:33:38,103
Probably are, assholes.

484
00:33:39,321 --> 00:33:41,106
Hey, make us an offer.

485
00:33:41,149 --> 00:33:43,325
- We're not selling it.
- The hell we're not.

486
00:33:43,369 --> 00:33:46,372
No, I've got names here.
We're going to find the relatives.

487
00:33:46,415 --> 00:33:48,461
Yeah, we ain't giving it
to them free.

488
00:33:48,504 --> 00:33:50,637
- Whose baby is this?
- It ain't yours.

489
00:33:50,680 --> 00:33:53,118
- It ain't yours.
- Did I not spring you from jail?

490
00:33:53,161 --> 00:33:54,185
Oh yeah, some spring.

491
00:33:54,191 --> 00:33:56,382
Have I not taken care
of you your whole life?

492
00:33:56,425 --> 00:33:58,558
We're partners.

493
00:33:58,601 --> 00:34:00,516
50-50.

494
00:34:00,560 --> 00:34:02,301
It's half yours and half mine.

495
00:34:02,344 --> 00:34:03,954
Fine.

496
00:34:03,998 --> 00:34:06,392
You can have
the half that shits.

497
00:34:06,435 --> 00:34:08,742
It turns out your uncle Buford

498
00:34:08,785 --> 00:34:10,787
arrived just in time,
little one.

499
00:34:10,831 --> 00:34:12,659
'Cause when you're
flat out of money,

500
00:34:12,702 --> 00:34:14,704
he has a special way
of shopping.

501
00:34:14,748 --> 00:34:17,446
Somebody stop those guys!

502
00:34:17,490 --> 00:34:20,058
Whew! Whew!

503
00:34:20,101 --> 00:34:22,799
Hey, we're calling the police!

504
00:34:40,382 --> 00:34:42,297
Hey, bue, it's ringin'.

505
00:34:42,341 --> 00:34:44,647
Here, take this.

506
00:34:44,691 --> 00:34:47,650
Is this the Santana residence?

507
00:34:47,694 --> 00:34:49,913
Are you the family of the folks

508
00:34:49,957 --> 00:34:52,438
who had that terrible
accident on the interstate?

509
00:34:52,481 --> 00:34:54,309
You are?

510
00:34:54,353 --> 00:34:56,485
I got some good news
for you, ma'am.

511
00:34:56,529 --> 00:35:00,533
- Tell them you'll kill it.
- I saved the little one.

512
00:35:01,795 --> 00:35:05,494
- That is the good news.
- And the bad news is, he'll kill it.

513
00:35:05,538 --> 00:35:08,584
No, I know that, ma'am.
I'm talking about the baby.

514
00:35:10,325 --> 00:35:12,980
And he'll wring
its scrawny little neck,

515
00:35:13,023 --> 00:35:16,853
if you don't put
$100,000 in an envelope...

516
00:35:18,855 --> 00:35:22,076
Hello? Hello?

517
00:35:22,120 --> 00:35:24,252
Man, they hung up.

518
00:35:25,384 --> 00:35:27,864
She don't want the baby.

519
00:35:27,908 --> 00:35:30,389
Maybe it's a bad one.

520
00:35:30,432 --> 00:35:32,260
- Like Damien.
- No, no, no.

521
00:35:32,304 --> 00:35:35,176
- Something's wrong here.
- No, shit there's something wrong.

522
00:35:35,220 --> 00:35:37,396
This thing just puked
like a slush gun on me.

523
00:35:37,439 --> 00:35:40,138
Hey, what did I tell you?
Were it green?

524
00:35:40,181 --> 00:35:42,444
- It's red.
- Red?!

525
00:35:42,488 --> 00:35:44,185
- Oh, Jesus.
- Watch out.

526
00:35:44,229 --> 00:35:46,448
There it goes again.

527
00:35:46,492 --> 00:35:48,842
Oh, man! Look!

528
00:35:48,885 --> 00:35:51,540
Hey, hey.

529
00:35:51,584 --> 00:35:54,326
- Yeah, that's a French fry.
- French fry?

530
00:35:54,369 --> 00:35:56,197
Yeah, the red part is ketchup.

531
00:35:56,241 --> 00:35:58,504
You gave this baby
French fries and ketchup?

532
00:35:58,547 --> 00:36:00,375
They're no damn good
without ketchup.

533
00:36:00,419 --> 00:36:03,248
You made her sick.
You made her damn sick.

534
00:36:03,291 --> 00:36:06,338
She was reaching for it.
I was just helping it out.

535
00:36:06,381 --> 00:36:08,427
Baby?!

536
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:10,690
Baby! She's choking!

537
00:36:10,733 --> 00:36:13,519
- What do I do?!
- Call 911!

538
00:36:13,562 --> 00:36:15,216
There's a clinic!

539
00:36:15,260 --> 00:36:18,219
- Down the alley and to the right!
- Oh, my god!

540
00:36:18,263 --> 00:36:20,439
Shit, 911!

541
00:36:23,224 --> 00:36:24,791
Could you watch our stuff?

542
00:36:28,229 --> 00:36:32,277
- There, a sign!
- This don't look good for us, Billy boy.

543
00:36:32,320 --> 00:36:35,193
- Going into a clinic...
- No shit, Buford!

544
00:36:35,236 --> 00:36:37,978
You're a wanted man!
Just throw it in!

545
00:36:38,021 --> 00:36:40,420
Somebody help, please!
My baby's not breathing!

546
00:36:40,426 --> 00:36:41,242
Down the hall!

547
00:36:41,286 --> 00:36:43,810
- Help!
- Oh lord!

548
00:36:43,853 --> 00:36:45,812
Get the hell
out of there, Billy!

549
00:36:49,816 --> 00:36:51,557
- Okay, what happened?
- Um...

550
00:36:51,600 --> 00:36:53,385
Any recent illnesses?

551
00:36:53,428 --> 00:36:56,344
Shots?
Any indication of allergy?

552
00:36:56,388 --> 00:36:58,433
- Speak to me!
- Uh...

553
00:36:58,477 --> 00:37:00,740
Had a fall of any kind?

554
00:37:00,783 --> 00:37:02,263
- Ingest anything?
- Huh?

555
00:37:02,307 --> 00:37:04,918
- Swallow anything?
- It was trying to bring something up.

556
00:37:04,961 --> 00:37:06,833
- It?
- Her, she!

557
00:37:06,876 --> 00:37:09,357
- Can I do something?
- Yeah, get security.

558
00:37:09,401 --> 00:37:12,447
- Hal!
- Come over here.

559
00:37:12,491 --> 00:37:14,057
Keep her mouth open.
Come over here.

560
00:37:14,101 --> 00:37:16,625
Hold her mouth open.
Little fingers.

561
00:37:18,061 --> 00:37:20,542
Now, close your mouth
around it so you don't drool.

562
00:37:20,586 --> 00:37:22,718
- Straight down.
- Do you need me?

563
00:37:22,762 --> 00:37:25,286
Stand by. Straight down.
Straight down.

564
00:37:25,330 --> 00:37:27,462
Okay, here we go.

565
00:37:27,506 --> 00:37:29,638
I know, I know.

566
00:37:32,424 --> 00:37:34,513
Yes.

567
00:37:39,518 --> 00:37:41,433
I know.
You did great.

568
00:37:41,476 --> 00:37:44,566
You did great.
You're fine.

569
00:37:46,176 --> 00:37:48,353
You're going to be fine.

570
00:37:48,396 --> 00:37:50,703
What's your name?

571
00:37:50,746 --> 00:37:53,096
Billy.

572
00:37:53,140 --> 00:37:55,577
Any ideas?

573
00:37:57,710 --> 00:38:00,756
- Tonsils?
- It's pepperoni!

574
00:38:00,800 --> 00:38:03,846
Another minute
and she would have been dead.

575
00:38:03,890 --> 00:38:05,370
You know what
I would have written

576
00:38:05,413 --> 00:38:07,372
on the death certificate
as the cause?

577
00:38:07,415 --> 00:38:11,376
- Pizza?
- Don't be messing with me, mister.

578
00:38:11,419 --> 00:38:13,508
Neglect...

579
00:38:13,552 --> 00:38:16,206
It falls under the same
category as child abuse,

580
00:38:16,250 --> 00:38:18,252
and I would be within my rights

581
00:38:18,296 --> 00:38:21,690
- to file charges right now.
- Jesus.

582
00:38:21,734 --> 00:38:24,127
- Here you go.
- So...

583
00:38:24,171 --> 00:38:26,347
I want some answers, Billy.

584
00:38:26,391 --> 00:38:28,567
They better be truthful,

585
00:38:28,610 --> 00:38:31,744
because we have the right to
repeat these same questions

586
00:38:31,787 --> 00:38:34,703
with you hooked up
to a lie detector.

587
00:38:34,747 --> 00:38:37,532
- Where's the mom?
- Of the...

588
00:38:39,404 --> 00:38:41,406
Right. Well, she...

589
00:38:43,625 --> 00:38:45,932
- Took off.
- Took off?

590
00:38:45,975 --> 00:38:48,587
- Mm-hmm.
- And she didn't want the baby?

591
00:38:48,630 --> 00:38:52,504
It was kind of a messy
situation in the end there,

592
00:38:52,547 --> 00:38:54,462
and finally I felt

593
00:38:54,506 --> 00:38:56,943
I had to pull the baby out.

594
00:38:56,986 --> 00:38:59,380
- She allowed that?
- Well, no.

595
00:38:59,424 --> 00:39:02,252
She was actually quite

596
00:39:02,296 --> 00:39:04,603
crushed at the time.

597
00:39:05,995 --> 00:39:07,910
Very broken up.

598
00:39:07,954 --> 00:39:09,390
Very.

599
00:39:11,305 --> 00:39:12,915
And this is the god's truth.

600
00:39:12,959 --> 00:39:16,005
I'll give these same answers
on a lie detector test anytime.

601
00:39:16,049 --> 00:39:18,573
- Excuse me, doctor?
- No, thanks, Hal.

602
00:39:18,617 --> 00:39:19,835
Thanks, Hal.

603
00:39:20,836 --> 00:39:23,143
My name is Bennet.

604
00:39:23,186 --> 00:39:25,232
I teach a class
for first-time parents

605
00:39:25,275 --> 00:39:27,408
here at the hospital
on Wednesday afternoons.

606
00:39:27,452 --> 00:39:30,193
This is your first, I assume.

607
00:39:30,237 --> 00:39:33,414
- You could tell?
- I'm going to need some information.

608
00:39:33,458 --> 00:39:36,765
Okay, how old?

609
00:39:36,809 --> 00:39:38,593
26.

610
00:39:39,464 --> 00:39:42,467
Oh, her.

611
00:39:42,510 --> 00:39:43,772
She's just a baby.

612
00:39:44,860 --> 00:39:48,081
- What, six, seven months?
- Exactly.

613
00:39:48,124 --> 00:39:49,517
When's her birth date?

614
00:39:49,561 --> 00:39:51,737
Guess.

615
00:39:53,478 --> 00:39:56,437
- June?
- Unbelievable.

616
00:39:56,481 --> 00:39:59,440
- Well, it's my field.
- Guess the date.

617
00:39:59,484 --> 00:40:01,877
- Why?
- It's your field.

618
00:40:03,879 --> 00:40:07,274
- 30th?
- Now that is unbelievable.

619
00:40:07,317 --> 00:40:09,624
You're good. Wow.

620
00:40:09,668 --> 00:40:11,452
What do you think of that, huh?

621
00:40:11,496 --> 00:40:15,108
June 30th.

622
00:40:15,151 --> 00:40:17,458
You like that?

623
00:40:18,459 --> 00:40:20,853
- Thank you.
- You were very lucky.

624
00:40:20,896 --> 00:40:23,421
And what is her name?

625
00:40:23,464 --> 00:40:25,423
- Shauna.
- Nice.

626
00:40:25,466 --> 00:40:28,730
- Shauna what?
- Shauna-Louise...

627
00:40:28,774 --> 00:40:31,254
Raedeen.

628
00:40:31,298 --> 00:40:34,040
Shauna-Louise Raedeen.

629
00:40:34,083 --> 00:40:36,042
Sounds good.

630
00:40:36,085 --> 00:40:38,305
Okay, I'm going to need
to get a picture.

631
00:40:41,961 --> 00:40:43,702
No, face me, please.

632
00:40:46,269 --> 00:40:48,184
All right, good.

633
00:40:48,228 --> 00:40:49,969
This will start a file.

634
00:40:50,012 --> 00:40:53,581
I want to see you here at noon
on Wednesday for the first class.

635
00:40:53,625 --> 00:40:57,019
You need to fill that out.
I need your name, address, phone number,

636
00:40:57,063 --> 00:41:01,589
- then sign at the bottom.
- Where? Where do I?

637
00:41:01,633 --> 00:41:03,635
Where it says father.

638
00:41:10,119 --> 00:41:12,121
Father.

639
00:41:13,471 --> 00:41:15,603
Dad.

640
00:41:15,647 --> 00:41:17,605
Now here's a note, dear one,

641
00:41:17,649 --> 00:41:20,434
on the importance of papers,

642
00:41:20,478 --> 00:41:22,610
signed at the bottom,
neat as you can.

643
00:41:22,654 --> 00:41:24,264
Billy...

644
00:41:24,307 --> 00:41:28,311
No, William.
Sounds better.

645
00:41:28,355 --> 00:41:31,097
Anything worthwhile
in this life requires them.

646
00:41:31,140 --> 00:41:33,665
William Raedeen.

647
00:41:36,885 --> 00:41:38,626
Sir?

648
00:41:38,670 --> 00:41:40,454
Oh.

649
00:41:40,498 --> 00:41:43,544
- How is she?
- Much better now.

650
00:41:43,588 --> 00:41:46,504
- What was it, croup?
- Pepperoni.

651
00:41:47,592 --> 00:41:50,116
Do you happen to know
when father's day is?

652
00:41:50,159 --> 00:41:52,553
- Uh-uh.
- I don't want her to miss it.

653
00:41:52,597 --> 00:41:55,425
Take care of her.

654
00:41:55,469 --> 00:41:58,603
From now on,
we order straight cheese.

655
00:41:58,646 --> 00:42:00,518
Thanks.

656
00:42:05,348 --> 00:42:06,828
You're in deep shit, boy.

657
00:42:06,872 --> 00:42:08,700
You know what this
baby could get you?

658
00:42:08,743 --> 00:42:10,658
Her name is
Shauna-Louise, Buford.

659
00:42:10,702 --> 00:42:12,660
Her birthday's June 30th.

660
00:42:12,704 --> 00:42:14,706
Kidnapping across state lines.

661
00:42:14,749 --> 00:42:17,447
Add that to post office burglary,
you know what you'd get?

662
00:42:17,491 --> 00:42:19,580
Buford, they gave me
papers on her.

663
00:42:19,624 --> 00:42:21,626
Say I'm the father.

664
00:42:21,669 --> 00:42:23,845
Yeah, well I say get rid of her

665
00:42:23,889 --> 00:42:25,891
before they hang your ass.

666
00:42:28,676 --> 00:42:31,026
But I couldn't part
with you, little one.

667
00:42:31,070 --> 00:42:33,768
And thus, we became part
of a new family.

668
00:42:33,812 --> 00:42:35,683
Strangers really.

669
00:42:35,727 --> 00:42:38,033
Some stranger than others.

670
00:42:39,295 --> 00:42:41,689
In particular a fella named
Laverne Gacey.

671
00:42:41,733 --> 00:42:43,604
He drank a lot
and made his living

672
00:42:43,648 --> 00:42:47,303
renting out houseboats bought
for him by his rich mama in Reno.

673
00:42:52,526 --> 00:42:56,051
I sensed from the beginning
he didn't like us much.

674
00:42:56,095 --> 00:42:58,706
But we did our best
to get along.

675
00:43:01,535 --> 00:43:03,624
I'd be an eagle

676
00:43:03,668 --> 00:43:05,626
and shit on all of you.

677
00:43:08,542 --> 00:43:10,283
I'd be a lion,

678
00:43:10,326 --> 00:43:13,547
take no shit from nobody.

679
00:43:13,591 --> 00:43:15,288
I'd be a dolphin

680
00:43:15,331 --> 00:43:18,639
cause they're kind and gentle.

681
00:43:18,683 --> 00:43:20,162
And slimy.

682
00:43:20,206 --> 00:43:22,600
I'd live in outer space.

683
00:43:23,775 --> 00:43:25,646
Just float around and...

684
00:43:27,561 --> 00:43:29,041
Float around.

685
00:43:29,084 --> 00:43:32,087
No one would bother me.

686
00:43:32,131 --> 00:43:34,089
No police.

687
00:43:34,133 --> 00:43:37,658
- No bills to pay.
- What about oxygen?

688
00:43:38,616 --> 00:43:41,706
- I wouldn't need none.
- What about black holes?

689
00:43:41,749 --> 00:43:43,621
Yeah, right,

690
00:43:43,664 --> 00:43:47,363
black holes.

691
00:43:47,407 --> 00:43:50,062
Speaking of which,
can I use that chapstick?

692
00:43:50,105 --> 00:43:53,108
- Yeah, but I want it back.
- Oh, you'll get it back.

693
00:43:58,113 --> 00:44:00,507
What about you?
What would you be?

694
00:44:02,335 --> 00:44:04,032
Just me, I guess.

695
00:44:04,076 --> 00:44:06,687
Things feel pretty good
to me right now.

696
00:44:06,731 --> 00:44:09,734
No money, no job,
no place to live.

697
00:44:11,344 --> 00:44:13,651
I guess what you dream of
is being a loser.

698
00:44:13,694 --> 00:44:16,305
What about thirsty one?

699
00:44:16,349 --> 00:44:17,872
What are her dreams?

700
00:44:17,916 --> 00:44:20,658
To be a movie star.

701
00:44:20,701 --> 00:44:22,877
No. I think
she just dreams

702
00:44:22,921 --> 00:44:24,749
of staying right where she is.

703
00:44:24,792 --> 00:44:26,489
I believe you're right.

704
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:29,492
Wake up here on her first
birthday, June 30th.

705
00:44:29,536 --> 00:44:32,321
Her second, the same date.

706
00:44:32,365 --> 00:44:35,281
Her third, her 16th.

707
00:44:35,324 --> 00:44:37,587
If she wakes up in your arms
on her 16th birthday,

708
00:44:37,631 --> 00:44:39,981
you're going
right to jail, mister.

709
00:44:43,463 --> 00:44:45,683
She belongs to me, you know.

710
00:44:45,726 --> 00:44:48,294
Hospital papers say
I'm her father.

711
00:44:48,337 --> 00:44:51,427
She don't belong to you,
you dumb-ass.

712
00:44:51,471 --> 00:44:53,778
And if she did,
it'd be one sorry life.

713
00:44:53,821 --> 00:44:55,693
I'll drink to that.

714
00:44:55,736 --> 00:44:58,739
- Well, excuse me.
- A child deserves better.

715
00:44:58,783 --> 00:45:00,436
What's he got to give a child?

716
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:02,961
You ever think of that?
Let's start with money.

717
00:45:03,004 --> 00:45:05,790
For clothes, and toys,

718
00:45:05,833 --> 00:45:08,270
and schools, and books,
and babysitters.

719
00:45:08,314 --> 00:45:10,925
And doctors, and bikes,

720
00:45:10,969 --> 00:45:13,841
and piano lessons,
and braces on her teeth,

721
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:17,715
and camp in the summer,
and coats in the winter,

722
00:45:17,758 --> 00:45:19,717
and a uniform for marching band.

723
00:45:19,760 --> 00:45:22,807
Them cost $60 each.

724
00:45:22,850 --> 00:45:24,504
Not to mention college.

725
00:45:24,547 --> 00:45:27,594
And besides the money,
it takes devotion.

726
00:45:27,637 --> 00:45:31,903
- Now that I got.
- You don't got shit.

727
00:45:31,946 --> 00:45:33,818
Or a pot to piss in.

728
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:36,472
Yeah? Well,
he's got a heart.

729
00:45:36,516 --> 00:45:37,647
And a hard on for you.

730
00:45:37,691 --> 00:45:39,693
You know what?
That's uncalled-for.

731
00:45:39,737 --> 00:45:42,696
Really?
What am I, blind?

732
00:45:42,740 --> 00:45:44,785
"Help me. Help me."
I'm in the dark, here.

733
00:45:44,829 --> 00:45:46,831
I can't see!

734
00:45:46,874 --> 00:45:49,094
You think I'm really fooled

735
00:45:49,137 --> 00:45:52,010
by this gitchy-gitchy goo shit?

736
00:45:52,053 --> 00:45:53,838
"I want to wake up
in your arms."

737
00:45:53,881 --> 00:45:56,405
This motherfucker
comes on my boat,

738
00:45:56,449 --> 00:45:59,887
- and I got to watch this shit go down?!
- Chapstick.

739
00:46:02,934 --> 00:46:05,632
My eucalyptus stings.

740
00:46:07,155 --> 00:46:09,592
Is something funny?
Is something funny?!

741
00:46:10,942 --> 00:46:12,639
Who, me?

742
00:46:12,682 --> 00:46:15,120
- Who am I talking to?
- Slow down, Verne.

743
00:46:15,163 --> 00:46:16,904
- Nah.
- Slow down!

744
00:46:16,948 --> 00:46:18,601
Breathe deep.
Look at the sky.

745
00:46:18,645 --> 00:46:20,516
No, you look at the fucking sky!

746
00:46:20,560 --> 00:46:22,431
This piss-ant comes on my boat,

747
00:46:22,475 --> 00:46:24,694
makes a pass at my woman
and laughs at me.

748
00:46:24,738 --> 00:46:27,567
- Did I miss something?
- No, you're just in time.

749
00:46:27,610 --> 00:46:29,395
Stand up, toad.

750
00:46:29,438 --> 00:46:33,225
- Stand the fuck up!
- Which toad you talking to?

751
00:46:33,268 --> 00:46:35,749
You want a piece of me, too?
I'll take you both on.

752
00:46:35,793 --> 00:46:37,533
Yeah?
Come on, yeah.

753
00:46:37,577 --> 00:46:40,667
Hey, wait a second.
Wait a second, mister!

754
00:46:40,710 --> 00:46:42,321
- Hey! Whoa!
- Motherfucker!

755
00:46:42,364 --> 00:46:44,236
- You want to go?!
- Hey, look, look.

756
00:46:44,279 --> 00:46:45,498
Whoa, wait, look.

757
00:46:45,541 --> 00:46:47,500
We're not... we're not interested

758
00:46:47,543 --> 00:46:48,612
in taking anybody on.

759
00:46:48,618 --> 00:46:50,764
You come on my boat,
fuck with my woman...

760
00:46:50,808 --> 00:46:51,818
fuck with your woman?

761
00:46:51,824 --> 00:46:54,028
Did you say something
about fucking my woman?!

762
00:46:54,072 --> 00:46:56,596
If I could get off your boat right
now, I would.

763
00:46:56,639 --> 00:46:59,120
- I can't swim, all right?
- Yeah, he can't swim.

764
00:46:59,164 --> 00:47:01,166
Your boy can't swim, huh?

765
00:47:01,209 --> 00:47:03,516
Maybe it's about time
you fucking learned.

766
00:47:03,559 --> 00:47:05,083
- Verne!
- Oh my god!

767
00:47:05,126 --> 00:47:07,694
- Stop him!
- Open the door!

768
00:47:07,737 --> 00:47:09,652
Verne!

769
00:47:09,696 --> 00:47:12,699
Open the door!

770
00:47:12,742 --> 00:47:14,657
Open the door!

771
00:47:14,701 --> 00:47:16,877
Jesus Christ!
Verne!

772
00:47:16,921 --> 00:47:18,487
- What the...
- Shut up!

773
00:47:18,531 --> 00:47:20,272
- Give me that baby!
- Shut up!

774
00:47:20,315 --> 00:47:22,274
What do you think you're doing?!

775
00:47:22,317 --> 00:47:24,537
- Give me...
- a man gets in over his head.

776
00:47:24,580 --> 00:47:27,192
- No!
- Got to learn how to swim!

777
00:47:27,235 --> 00:47:29,194
No! Somebody help!

778
00:47:31,152 --> 00:47:33,546
- Get the baby!
- Billy!

779
00:47:36,854 --> 00:47:39,595
That a boy, Billy!
You're getting the hang of it!

780
00:47:47,038 --> 00:47:50,737
Loozy, it's a horse race
and you're winning!

781
00:47:50,780 --> 00:47:53,740
- Hold on, baby!
- Let's go!

782
00:48:03,881 --> 00:48:05,883
Whoo!
Son of a bitch!

783
00:48:07,580 --> 00:48:10,496
You evil piece of shit!

784
00:48:13,629 --> 00:48:15,414
Get the baby!

785
00:48:18,852 --> 00:48:20,941
Breathing!
Is she breathing?!

786
00:48:20,985 --> 00:48:24,510
- I don't know.
- Get this thing off her!

787
00:48:24,553 --> 00:48:26,164
Oh, shit!

788
00:48:28,166 --> 00:48:30,908
- It's Jack!
- You fuck!

789
00:48:30,951 --> 00:48:32,953
- You fucker!
- Fuck!

790
00:48:38,785 --> 00:48:40,656
Now, is this a party or what?!

791
00:48:40,700 --> 00:48:42,136
Yeah!

792
00:48:42,180 --> 00:48:44,747
You fucker!

793
00:48:44,791 --> 00:48:47,098
Jesus Christ!

794
00:49:04,811 --> 00:49:07,596
It's a curse on us.

795
00:49:07,640 --> 00:49:10,599
Let's leave it on some
church steps somewhere,

796
00:49:10,643 --> 00:49:13,559
and get the hell out of here.

797
00:49:22,785 --> 00:49:24,744
She's got the same name as you.

798
00:49:24,787 --> 00:49:26,746
You know that?

799
00:49:26,789 --> 00:49:28,791
Shauna-Louise.

800
00:49:30,576 --> 00:49:32,578
Little Loozy.

801
00:49:36,364 --> 00:49:38,192
What do you see in him?

802
00:49:38,236 --> 00:49:40,629
Don't name her that.

803
00:49:41,979 --> 00:49:45,199
Don't name her anything.
She's not yours to name.

804
00:49:45,243 --> 00:49:48,986
Estelle is right.
Your buddy's right.

805
00:49:51,989 --> 00:49:55,383
Take her somewhere,
and get your meddling ass out of here.

806
00:50:05,002 --> 00:50:06,655
Billy!

807
00:50:06,699 --> 00:50:09,267
- Billy, hey!
- What is it?

808
00:50:09,310 --> 00:50:10,529
Come on! Come quick!

809
00:50:10,572 --> 00:50:12,531
It's on right after
the commercial!

810
00:50:12,574 --> 00:50:15,055
- What's going on?!
- Stormy, come on!

811
00:50:15,099 --> 00:50:17,666
Hurry up!

812
00:50:17,710 --> 00:50:19,712
Everybody!

813
00:50:21,235 --> 00:50:23,846
- Quick.
- What is it?

814
00:50:23,890 --> 00:50:26,719
I think this is your baby
they're talking about.

815
00:50:26,762 --> 00:50:28,764
And they're looking
for some shady lawyer.

816
00:50:28,808 --> 00:50:30,549
- What lawyer?
- What's going on?

817
00:50:30,592 --> 00:50:32,812
- What are you talking about?
- I wrote it down.

818
00:50:32,855 --> 00:50:34,379
Adoption scam.

819
00:50:34,422 --> 00:50:37,295
"Local couple duped
in adoption swindle."

820
00:50:37,338 --> 00:50:39,340
There's a lawyer who took cash

821
00:50:39,384 --> 00:50:41,168
for some baby
that's disappeared.

822
00:50:41,212 --> 00:50:44,084
These is bank words, boy!

823
00:50:44,128 --> 00:50:47,261
Cash! Adoption!
Somebody wanting our baby!

824
00:50:47,305 --> 00:50:49,089
And wanting it bad.

825
00:50:49,133 --> 00:50:50,917
- Hey, look.
- Last thing we knew

826
00:50:50,960 --> 00:50:53,006
it was on its way
from Albuquerque.

827
00:50:53,050 --> 00:50:55,661
Being driven by a courier.

828
00:50:55,704 --> 00:50:58,185
And when it didn't arrive,
we called the lawyer

829
00:50:58,229 --> 00:51:00,796
and found out his phone
had been disconnected.

830
00:51:00,840 --> 00:51:04,931
- And you'd given him money?
- It's not the money, it's the baby.

831
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:07,716
I mean, my wife is...

832
00:51:10,589 --> 00:51:12,808
My wife has been
so eager, you know?

833
00:51:12,852 --> 00:51:15,898
- And that's why we didn't...
- This guy looks familiar.

834
00:51:15,942 --> 00:51:18,553
- Hey, shh!
- Did this lawyer seem legitimate to you?

835
00:51:18,597 --> 00:51:21,991
Yes, he sent us
these adoption papers

836
00:51:22,035 --> 00:51:24,820
with a space here
to write our names in,

837
00:51:24,864 --> 00:51:27,997
that's signed by the Attorney
General of the state.

838
00:51:28,041 --> 00:51:30,043
I was going to put it
in this frame.

839
00:51:33,612 --> 00:51:37,311
- How did this lawyer...
- Pinkney Pontiac, am I right?

840
00:51:38,486 --> 00:51:40,532
Pink slip Pinkney.

841
00:51:40,575 --> 00:51:42,490
Yeah, he works the clubs.

842
00:51:42,534 --> 00:51:45,145
He finds somebody
losing big at the tables,

843
00:51:45,189 --> 00:51:47,930
makes a quick cash deal for
the pink slip on their car.

844
00:51:47,974 --> 00:51:50,194
Pays them, you know,

845
00:51:50,237 --> 00:51:51,673
half of what it's worth,

846
00:51:51,717 --> 00:51:53,849
then he finds somebody
winning big

847
00:51:53,893 --> 00:51:55,590
sells them the car,

848
00:51:55,634 --> 00:51:58,289
fast as he bought it,
for twice what he paid.

849
00:51:58,332 --> 00:52:01,466
Whoohoo!
That's a good scam!

850
00:52:01,509 --> 00:52:03,294
It's wrong, you ask me.

851
00:52:03,337 --> 00:52:04,904
How many times
you been arrested?

852
00:52:04,947 --> 00:52:06,949
Not for taking
advantage of losers.

853
00:52:06,993 --> 00:52:11,258
That's the beauty part. Couple of
losers about to take advantage of him.

854
00:52:11,302 --> 00:52:12,651
Forget it.
I don't like him.

855
00:52:12,694 --> 00:52:16,263
- Oh, he don't like him.
- He's a big dummy.

856
00:52:16,307 --> 00:52:20,485
He's a big,
rich dummy who wants what we got.

857
00:52:20,528 --> 00:52:22,791
This is a human being
we're talking about here.

858
00:52:22,835 --> 00:52:25,664
I understand that, Billy,
but if we got to give it back.

859
00:52:25,707 --> 00:52:28,406
- Who says we got to, huh?!
- The state says!

860
00:52:28,449 --> 00:52:29,842
The Attorney General!

861
00:52:29,885 --> 00:52:32,540
He's got the adoption papers!

862
00:52:32,584 --> 00:52:34,586
Pinky pink slipney.

863
00:52:34,629 --> 00:52:38,285
- He owns the damn thing!
- Yeah, but I named her, damn it!

864
00:52:38,329 --> 00:52:41,027
And I decided her birthday!

865
00:52:42,289 --> 00:52:44,987
...she's been with
the detectives all day.

866
00:52:45,031 --> 00:52:47,990
Look in the yard!

867
00:52:48,034 --> 00:52:50,079
Is that a swing set I see?

868
00:52:51,429 --> 00:52:53,822
That's why I did it, Billy.

869
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:55,781
The social worker made me see

870
00:52:55,824 --> 00:52:58,871
it'd be selfish not to give
it the best life possible.

871
00:52:58,914 --> 00:53:01,134
He's a big dummy.

872
00:53:01,178 --> 00:53:05,094
- The kid'll survive that.
- Amen.

873
00:53:05,138 --> 00:53:08,794
- What will you pray for?
- What would I pray for?

874
00:53:09,621 --> 00:53:13,494
That this child
is alive and well.

875
00:53:14,626 --> 00:53:18,020
And somehow finds its way home.

876
00:53:18,064 --> 00:53:21,328
And sir,
what would you pray for?

877
00:53:22,764 --> 00:53:25,071
I just pray
that I can find a way

878
00:53:25,114 --> 00:53:27,900
to take some of my wife's
sadness away.

879
00:53:31,295 --> 00:53:33,688
Oh lord, Normie.

880
00:53:33,732 --> 00:53:37,083
Your prayers have been answered.

881
00:53:42,828 --> 00:53:46,658
Now remember, $25,000,
not a penny less.

882
00:53:46,701 --> 00:53:49,443
You tell him you want it
in one lump sum

883
00:53:49,487 --> 00:53:52,229
or you're delivering
that baby in installments.

884
00:53:52,272 --> 00:53:54,579
You'll chop it up!

885
00:53:54,622 --> 00:53:56,624
And look crazy.

886
00:53:56,668 --> 00:53:59,236
- Your teeth...
- Is that him?

887
00:54:01,499 --> 00:54:03,979
- Yeah, that's him.
- Looks dumber than he did on TV.

888
00:54:04,023 --> 00:54:06,330
You want me to do it?
'Cause I'll do it.

889
00:54:06,373 --> 00:54:08,157
I got to see if he's fit.

890
00:54:09,594 --> 00:54:11,813
$25,000, not a penny less,

891
00:54:11,857 --> 00:54:13,772
- or you'll chop it up.
- Chop it up.

892
00:54:13,815 --> 00:54:15,861
Now look mean.
Teeth!

893
00:54:20,344 --> 00:54:23,434
Jesus Christ!

894
00:54:31,268 --> 00:54:33,226
Looks like you could use
a car, son.

895
00:54:33,270 --> 00:54:34,880
- Pinkney?
- Yes, I am.

896
00:54:34,923 --> 00:54:37,622
I got a honey here for you.
Mint condition.

897
00:54:37,665 --> 00:54:40,799
Owned by some oil sheik
who got unlucky at the tables.

898
00:54:40,842 --> 00:54:42,409
Had to swap it for quick cash.

899
00:54:42,453 --> 00:54:44,411
What I did to him,
you can do to me.

900
00:54:44,455 --> 00:54:47,458
Want the Vaseline?
Here, I'll bend over.

901
00:54:48,720 --> 00:54:50,678
- I got the baby.
- You want this baby?

902
00:54:50,722 --> 00:54:54,334
- Sold! It's yours!
- The baby you adopted. I got it.

903
00:54:54,378 --> 00:54:56,118
- Say what?
- I got the baby!

904
00:55:00,645 --> 00:55:02,516
I see.

905
00:55:02,560 --> 00:55:05,737
- You want more money?
- $25,000.

906
00:55:05,780 --> 00:55:07,608
Uh-huh.

907
00:55:07,652 --> 00:55:10,089
You give that boss of
yours a message from me.

908
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:13,266
Fool me once, shame on you,

909
00:55:13,310 --> 00:55:16,835
fool me twice, shame on me.

910
00:55:16,878 --> 00:55:19,751
See, this is a used car lot.

911
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:21,927
Those security cameras
are taking nice,

912
00:55:21,970 --> 00:55:24,451
close-up pictures
of you right now.

913
00:55:24,495 --> 00:55:26,366
That truck you come out of?

914
00:55:26,410 --> 00:55:28,803
I'm sure we got the
license plate on film,

915
00:55:28,847 --> 00:55:30,936
which easily gives us an address

916
00:55:30,979 --> 00:55:32,851
and telephone number.

917
00:55:32,894 --> 00:55:35,897
I'll bet we got the face of that
idiot sticking out of there.

918
00:55:39,466 --> 00:55:41,816
- 10,000 would be fine.
- Be fine with me, too.

919
00:55:41,860 --> 00:55:43,601
'Cause that's what I paid.

920
00:55:43,644 --> 00:55:46,734
And I want it back. Cash.

921
00:55:46,778 --> 00:55:49,650
One lump sum and we call
this thing even.

922
00:55:49,694 --> 00:55:52,784
I tear up those photos
and you go on free.

923
00:55:52,827 --> 00:55:54,916
- You don't want the baby?
- Never did.

924
00:55:54,960 --> 00:55:56,614
My wife did.

925
00:55:56,657 --> 00:55:59,660
But for the same money,
I'd as soon have an Evinrude.

926
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:01,662
I saw a honey of a 200-horse.

927
00:56:01,706 --> 00:56:02,707
Inboard...

928
00:56:02,750 --> 00:56:05,318
This is a honey of a baby.
It's cute,

929
00:56:05,362 --> 00:56:07,364
it's in great condition,
it's not fat...

930
00:56:07,407 --> 00:56:09,409
- does it shit in its pants?
- Yeah, but...

931
00:56:09,453 --> 00:56:11,368
Evinrude don't,

932
00:56:11,411 --> 00:56:15,415
- and you don't got to send it to college.
- Listen, I'll chop it up.

933
00:56:15,459 --> 00:56:17,286
I'll kill it.

934
00:56:18,810 --> 00:56:20,942
That's just silly,
isn't it, boy?

935
00:56:20,986 --> 00:56:21,895
Teeth blew it?

936
00:56:21,901 --> 00:56:24,642
I don't know about that,
just silly, that's all.

937
00:56:24,685 --> 00:56:27,122
You listen to me, son.

938
00:56:27,166 --> 00:56:29,951
You got 48 hours,
you understand?

939
00:56:29,995 --> 00:56:32,258
Now you tell
that shyster lawyer,

940
00:56:32,301 --> 00:56:35,348
motherfucking boss of yours

941
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:36,784
to put that money in your hand,

942
00:56:36,828 --> 00:56:38,395
and you put it in mine,

943
00:56:38,438 --> 00:56:40,962
or I'll have your face
plastered on every front page

944
00:56:41,006 --> 00:56:44,401
of every newspaper,
every post office wall,

945
00:56:44,444 --> 00:56:47,708
police station and telephone
pole from here to Chickeesaw.

946
00:56:49,884 --> 00:56:52,234
Where exactly is Chickeesaw?

947
00:56:53,322 --> 00:56:55,499
You know where
the sun goes down?

948
00:56:55,542 --> 00:56:59,154
That solid black line
it sinks behind?

949
00:56:59,198 --> 00:57:02,462
- Mm-hmm.
- That's Chickeesaw.

950
00:57:07,946 --> 00:57:10,427
- 10,000, huh?
- And we're even.

951
00:57:10,470 --> 00:57:12,385
I'll even throw in
the adoption papers.

952
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:14,039
- You will?
- Shit yeah.

953
00:57:14,082 --> 00:57:16,824
- And the frame.
- The frame?

954
00:57:19,740 --> 00:57:22,090
Whoohoo!
Sorry.

955
00:57:22,134 --> 00:57:23,570
Asshole!

956
00:57:29,097 --> 00:57:31,317
How did it go?

957
00:57:31,360 --> 00:57:34,102
- Come on, man, how did it go?
- I don't know.

958
00:57:34,146 --> 00:57:36,670
He go for the 25?

959
00:57:36,714 --> 00:57:41,283
- He said 10.
- He'll pay 10?

960
00:57:43,938 --> 00:57:45,636
He wants 10.

961
00:57:45,679 --> 00:57:48,508
He wants 10?

962
00:57:48,552 --> 00:57:50,989
That's what he paid.
He wants it back.

963
00:57:52,207 --> 00:57:54,819
He don't want that baby, Buford.
He never did.

964
00:57:54,862 --> 00:57:58,083
He wants an evinrude.

965
00:58:01,347 --> 00:58:05,046
Fuck him!
Did you tell him you'd kill it?

966
00:58:05,090 --> 00:58:07,527
- I did.
- What did he say?

967
00:58:07,571 --> 00:58:09,529
That he got our faces
and license plates

968
00:58:09,573 --> 00:58:11,879
on his security camera,
and he'll give us 48 hours

969
00:58:11,923 --> 00:58:14,491
to get the cash or he's
calling the police.

970
00:58:17,537 --> 00:58:18,973
So what do you think?

971
00:58:19,017 --> 00:58:22,977
I don't think the meeting
went very well.

972
00:58:25,502 --> 00:58:29,027
I don't think the meeting
went very well at all!

973
00:58:31,029 --> 00:58:34,293
That baby just done us again!

974
00:58:38,340 --> 00:58:41,126
- I want to buy it.
- Huh?

975
00:58:41,169 --> 00:58:42,823
I want to buy the baby.

976
00:58:44,695 --> 00:58:46,653
Have you lost
your fucking mind?!

977
00:58:46,697 --> 00:58:49,787
We've got 48 hours to disappear!

978
00:58:49,830 --> 00:58:52,833
- No one wants this baby.
- Including me.

979
00:58:54,095 --> 00:58:57,055
- So you won't help me?
- No way!

980
00:59:03,540 --> 00:59:06,412
What if I make it
worth your while, huh?

981
00:59:06,455 --> 00:59:09,894
We steal $50,000.
You keep all of it but 10.

982
00:59:10,677 --> 00:59:13,158
We hold up a jewelry
store, rob a bank...

983
00:59:13,201 --> 00:59:15,595
For a million,
you keep it all but 10.

984
00:59:15,639 --> 00:59:17,554
You'd do a job like that?

985
00:59:17,597 --> 00:59:19,643
I know I never agreed to before,

986
00:59:19,686 --> 00:59:22,559
but I never had a reason
that made it feel right.

987
00:59:24,169 --> 00:59:26,780
That judge was wrong.

988
00:59:26,824 --> 00:59:29,653
You raised me up good
to know right from wrong.

989
00:59:29,696 --> 00:59:32,394
And I know this is right.

990
00:59:33,700 --> 00:59:35,659
From the moment
I laid eyes on that baby,

991
00:59:35,702 --> 00:59:38,270
I knew it was meant to be mine.

992
00:59:38,313 --> 00:59:40,533
And you know who's going
to be the first one

993
00:59:40,577 --> 00:59:43,362
to get a picture of her
high school graduation, huh?

994
00:59:44,624 --> 00:59:46,713
- Me.
- That judge.

995
00:59:48,106 --> 00:59:50,717
That judge who said I'd
never amount to anything,

996
00:59:50,761 --> 00:59:52,719
he gets the first one.

997
00:59:55,766 --> 00:59:57,768
Make the second one mine.

998
01:00:03,774 --> 01:00:05,558
Candles,

999
01:00:05,602 --> 01:00:07,560
carburetors.

1000
01:00:07,604 --> 01:00:10,084
Hey, how about casino?

1001
01:00:10,128 --> 01:00:13,305
Casino?
No way.

1002
01:00:13,348 --> 01:00:16,134
They're just waiting
for rubes like you.

1003
01:00:16,177 --> 01:00:18,353
That's what she said
about banks.

1004
01:00:18,397 --> 01:00:20,355
How about dog groomers?

1005
01:00:20,399 --> 01:00:23,054
- What are you looking for?
- Places to rob.

1006
01:00:23,097 --> 01:00:25,970
I got to come up
with $10,000, fast.

1007
01:00:26,013 --> 01:00:28,668
Oh, well, I know an easy 20.

1008
01:00:29,843 --> 01:00:32,890
Look under the p's.
Peerless pawn.

1009
01:00:32,933 --> 01:00:35,675
Eew, what's this hair

1010
01:00:35,719 --> 01:00:38,243
doing on my good moisturizer?

1011
01:00:38,286 --> 01:00:41,289
This really rich guy
lost a bundle

1012
01:00:41,333 --> 01:00:42,682
at tables last night,

1013
01:00:42,726 --> 01:00:44,858
and parked his wife's
jewels at a pawn shop.

1014
01:00:44,902 --> 01:00:47,426
And the night manager
there just happens

1015
01:00:47,469 --> 01:00:50,037
- to be a friend of mine.
- Yeah, so?

1016
01:00:50,081 --> 01:00:53,127
So, he is willing to be held up

1017
01:00:53,171 --> 01:00:55,608
at gunpoint
for $1,000 in advance,

1018
01:00:55,652 --> 01:00:57,828
and half of what you get
for fencing the goods.

1019
01:00:57,871 --> 01:00:59,917
- Good scam.
- Yeah.

1020
01:00:59,960 --> 01:01:02,136
- Yeah.
- But you got to use a gun

1021
01:01:02,180 --> 01:01:03,703
and shoot a hole in the wall.

1022
01:01:03,747 --> 01:01:05,313
Hurry it up,

1023
01:01:05,357 --> 01:01:07,359
'cause I ain't
the only one who knows.

1024
01:01:07,402 --> 01:01:09,230
Tell him we're in.

1025
01:01:09,274 --> 01:01:11,363
Wait, where do we get the 1,000?

1026
01:01:13,713 --> 01:01:14,975
Can you advance us?

1027
01:01:16,368 --> 01:01:17,804
Oh, let me see.

1028
01:01:19,806 --> 01:01:21,590
You know what?

1029
01:01:21,634 --> 01:01:23,767
That would be a big
fat fucking no way.

1030
01:01:29,773 --> 01:01:32,863
Hey, wait a minute.

1031
01:01:32,906 --> 01:01:34,342
I could get it.

1032
01:01:34,386 --> 01:01:37,041
Tess still owes me
for the plumbing.

1033
01:01:37,084 --> 01:01:39,739
That house wouldn't have a pipe in
it, if it weren't for me.

1034
01:01:39,783 --> 01:01:42,699
- Tess ain't going to give you...
- she better, damn it.

1035
01:01:42,742 --> 01:01:45,702
Or I'll... I'll rip the pipes out

1036
01:01:45,745 --> 01:01:47,834
and the toilet along with it!

1037
01:01:47,878 --> 01:01:49,793
Then where would she be, huh?!

1038
01:01:49,836 --> 01:01:51,838
Her and her fancy fella.

1039
01:01:51,882 --> 01:01:54,275
Shitting in the desert.

1040
01:01:59,019 --> 01:02:00,717
Buford, we don't got a thousand,

1041
01:02:00,760 --> 01:02:03,632
- and we don't got a gun.
- It's just as well.

1042
01:02:03,676 --> 01:02:05,765
'Cause you two would fuck it
up, anyway.

1043
01:02:05,809 --> 01:02:08,594
Are you encouraging
these lunatics?

1044
01:02:08,637 --> 01:02:10,422
Hey, she's got a gun.

1045
01:02:11,597 --> 01:02:13,381
Well, actually,
it belongs to Verne.

1046
01:02:13,425 --> 01:02:15,732
But he doesn't seem
to be here right now, does he?

1047
01:02:15,775 --> 01:02:18,299
Let's go.

1048
01:02:18,343 --> 01:02:19,953
Well?

1049
01:02:21,825 --> 01:02:25,785
You tell the night
watchman you got your boys.

1050
01:02:25,829 --> 01:02:27,961
We'll...

1051
01:02:28,005 --> 01:02:30,834
We'll get you
the cash... tomorrow.

1052
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,445
We're in.

1053
01:02:35,099 --> 01:02:37,057
Good luck to you.

1054
01:02:42,193 --> 01:02:43,803
I'll get that money.

1055
01:02:45,587 --> 01:02:47,676
Or I'll rip out that damn toilet

1056
01:02:47,720 --> 01:02:49,766
and the septic tank
along with it!

1057
01:03:19,926 --> 01:03:21,928
Shauna-Louise?

1058
01:03:23,930 --> 01:03:27,325
- You all right?
- Can you go away, please?

1059
01:03:27,368 --> 01:03:29,588
I got to ask you something.

1060
01:03:29,631 --> 01:03:32,069
Come to the window.

1061
01:03:55,266 --> 01:03:58,269
How many outfits you think
a little girl needs?

1062
01:03:58,312 --> 01:04:01,359
I was thinking two...
One for school,

1063
01:04:01,402 --> 01:04:03,883
and one just to get dirty in...

1064
01:04:03,927 --> 01:04:05,972
- Three.
- Three?

1065
01:04:06,016 --> 01:04:08,888
- What's the third?
- Church.

1066
01:04:08,932 --> 01:04:10,759
Oh, right.

1067
01:04:10,803 --> 01:04:13,632
I guess you should do
that if you have a child.

1068
01:04:14,981 --> 01:04:18,724
- Would you?
- I don't know.

1069
01:04:25,513 --> 01:04:27,907
I'm leaving soon...

1070
01:04:27,951 --> 01:04:30,040
With the baby.

1071
01:04:32,433 --> 01:04:34,958
I wondered if you'd like
to come along?

1072
01:04:39,223 --> 01:04:41,573
I mean, I'd take care of it.

1073
01:04:41,616 --> 01:04:42,879
You wouldn't...

1074
01:04:42,922 --> 01:04:45,620
You wouldn't have to be
the mother or anything.

1075
01:04:46,795 --> 01:04:49,276
I'm sure you want
children of your own.

1076
01:04:52,627 --> 01:04:54,629
I don't know.

1077
01:05:13,170 --> 01:05:16,173
If anybody hit my daughter...

1078
01:05:18,784 --> 01:05:20,786
I'd kill him.

1079
01:05:26,052 --> 01:05:28,925
If anybody touched my
daughter, I'd kill him.

1080
01:05:33,842 --> 01:05:36,193
Why do you let him?

1081
01:05:40,414 --> 01:05:42,895
Do you see that cactus
over there?

1082
01:05:42,939 --> 01:05:45,202
The big one?

1083
01:05:51,991 --> 01:05:53,950
I envy it.

1084
01:05:56,474 --> 01:05:58,911
Not needing to be touched.

1085
01:06:12,185 --> 01:06:15,014
I want you to come with me.

1086
01:06:15,058 --> 01:06:18,409
Go to church on Sundays.

1087
01:06:18,452 --> 01:06:20,889
Set a good example.

1088
01:06:23,196 --> 01:06:24,981
I do.

1089
01:07:03,976 --> 01:07:05,717
- Buford?
- Hmm?

1090
01:07:05,760 --> 01:07:07,980
- Buford!
- What?

1091
01:07:08,024 --> 01:07:09,895
Look, it's right there
in the window.

1092
01:07:12,115 --> 01:07:15,814
Man, look at that guitar.

1093
01:07:15,857 --> 01:07:17,946
- I want that guitar.
- Forget the guitar,

1094
01:07:17,990 --> 01:07:21,428
- you can't play the guitar.
- I could if I had that guitar.

1095
01:07:21,472 --> 01:07:24,344
Hey, you think that's him?

1096
01:07:24,388 --> 01:07:27,956
I'll find out.
Hey, hey, buddy?!

1097
01:07:28,000 --> 01:07:29,958
Hey, we're planning
to rob this place

1098
01:07:30,002 --> 01:07:32,483
- are you the guy we talked to?
- Jesus, Buford!

1099
01:07:32,526 --> 01:07:34,876
If ain't him,
he's just gonna say no.

1100
01:07:34,920 --> 01:07:36,791
- What did he say?
- I...

1101
01:07:36,835 --> 01:07:39,533
Sorry, my friend here's
been drinking a bit.

1102
01:07:39,577 --> 01:07:41,927
- We're Stormy's friends.
- And?

1103
01:07:41,970 --> 01:07:44,321
And we're on our way
to get the 1000.

1104
01:07:44,364 --> 01:07:46,192
Shut the fuck up, man!

1105
01:07:46,236 --> 01:07:49,065
- I don't know what you're talking about.
- See, he ain't the guy.

1106
01:07:49,108 --> 01:07:52,372
Don't be seen talking to me.
Who said you could come talk to me?

1107
01:07:52,416 --> 01:07:54,940
- Somebody could hear you out here.
- Right, right.

1108
01:07:54,983 --> 01:07:57,856
Is that the way
to the interstate?!

1109
01:07:59,031 --> 01:08:01,120
- Is it that way?!
- Get the fuck out of here!

1110
01:08:01,164 --> 01:08:03,166
All right, we're cool, man!

1111
01:08:03,209 --> 01:08:06,473
- All right!
- Jesus, Buford!

1112
01:08:06,517 --> 01:08:10,999
If we pull this off, I hope you take
your money and go very far away.

1113
01:08:11,043 --> 01:08:12,784
Oh, we'll pull it off.

1114
01:08:12,827 --> 01:08:14,873
Hey, I've raised you this far.

1115
01:08:14,916 --> 01:08:17,180

Yeah, I sent them.

1136

How do I arrange
to never see you again?

- For the next lifetime.

1142
01:11:30,068 --> 01:11:32,505
We had our fun though,
didn't we, Tess?

1143
01:11:34,333 --> 01:11:36,466
No.

Bue?

1148
01:12:17,898 --> 01:12:20,336
I think she hates me.

1149
01:12:23,295 --> 01:12:25,558
That's all I can conclude.

1150
01:12:29,562 --> 01:12:32,870
That was a bad day
for Buford, little one.

1151
01:12:32,913 --> 01:12:35,525
I remember, it was a Saturday.

1152
01:12:35,568 --> 01:12:38,702

Excuse me?

- Can I ask you a question?
- Jesus Christ, man.

1158
01:13:38,892 --> 01:13:41,460
What are you doing?
The whole point of passing the thing

1159
01:13:41,504 --> 01:13:44,028
was so people wouldn't
see us talking to each other.

1160
01:13:44,071 --> 01:13:46,160
Oh, right!

1161
01:13:46,204 --> 01:13:48,119

Will you do that, please?

1164
01:13:52,079 --> 01:13:53,864
So if you get caught,
nobody can say,

1165
01:13:53,907 --> 01:13:56,519
- "he knew the guy."
- We won't get caught, sir.

1166
01:13:56,562 --> 01:13:58,956
So far, you've been
fucking up pretty good.

1167
01:14:03,526 --> 01:14:07,007
That guitar in the window.

1168
01:14:07,051 --> 01:14:08,705
Could I have it?

1169
01:14:08,748 --> 01:14:12,665
Well, you'll have
the gun, right?

1170
01:14:12,709 --> 01:14:14,667
- Yeah.
- Well?!

1171
01:14:14,711 --> 01:14:17,061
Oh, right!
Right.

1172
01:14:17,104 --> 01:14:19,019
Gimme that guitar!

1173
01:14:24,547 --> 01:14:28,986
- Bue, let's go.
- Man...

1174
01:14:29,029 --> 01:14:31,379
He's grumpy.

1175
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:39,300
- Oh dear god.
- What?

1176
01:14:39,344 --> 01:14:41,607
Oh no, not now.

1177
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:43,391
Who is that?

1178
01:14:46,569 --> 01:14:48,484
Fucking asshole!

1179
01:14:51,399 --> 01:14:54,446
- Who was that?!
- The ghost of Christmas past.

1180
01:14:54,490 --> 01:14:56,535
He's headed... you know
where he's headed.

1181
01:14:56,579 --> 01:14:58,624
- Let's go!
- Hurry up!

1182
01:15:21,952 --> 01:15:23,954
Am I stupid?

1183
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:43,016
- How you doing?
- Okay.

1184
01:15:44,365 --> 01:15:46,542
She have the baby, yet?

1185
01:15:46,585 --> 01:15:49,806
Can't you tell?

1186
01:15:51,764 --> 01:15:53,897
Is it a boy or girl?

1187
01:15:53,940 --> 01:15:55,899
Which would you rather?

1188
01:15:55,942 --> 01:15:59,076
It don't really matter.

1189
01:15:59,119 --> 01:16:01,165
It's a girl.

1190
01:16:03,080 --> 01:16:06,736
Say, is she...
Look like her mother?

1191
01:16:06,779 --> 01:16:10,130
No, she looks a lot
like her dad.

1192
01:16:10,174 --> 01:16:12,698
- She's a cute kid.
- Thank you.

1193
01:16:23,579 --> 01:16:25,581
Hi, Estelle.

1194
01:16:26,930 --> 01:16:28,975
Jesus Christ.

1195
01:16:29,019 --> 01:16:31,499
You look beautiful.

1196
01:16:32,936 --> 01:16:35,286
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

1197
01:16:35,329 --> 01:16:38,942
Especially for a girl
who's just had a baby.

1198
01:16:38,985 --> 01:16:41,031
Two months ago.

1199
01:16:41,074 --> 01:16:43,686
It came early.

1200
01:16:43,729 --> 01:16:45,949
I wish you'd had a phone.

1201
01:16:45,992 --> 01:16:47,559
I'd like to have called.

1202
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:52,912
I left plenty
of messages for you

1203
01:16:52,956 --> 01:16:55,045
till your number got changed.

1204
01:16:56,350 --> 01:16:59,092
I'm sorry.

1205
01:16:59,136 --> 01:17:01,834
My wife, well,

1206
01:17:01,878 --> 01:17:04,576
when she heard
your last message saying

1207
01:17:04,620 --> 01:17:07,710
- you wouldn't terminate...
- Yeah, I kind of thought

1208
01:17:07,753 --> 01:17:09,929
I might hear back
from you after that.

1209
01:17:09,973 --> 01:17:11,888
She left me after that.

1210
01:17:11,931 --> 01:17:13,933
We're not together anymore.

1211
01:17:14,934 --> 01:17:18,372
- Is that right?
- I've been thinking a lot

1212
01:17:18,416 --> 01:17:21,027
about you and the baby.

1213
01:17:21,071 --> 01:17:24,117
How hard it must be for you,

1214
01:17:24,161 --> 01:17:25,728
being alone.

1215
01:17:25,771 --> 01:17:28,426
And I came here to tell you,

1216
01:17:28,469 --> 01:17:34,432
I think a child deserves two
parents, don't you?

1217
01:17:34,475 --> 01:17:38,044
I haven't always acted like it,

1218
01:17:38,088 --> 01:17:40,003
but I've always liked children.

1219
01:17:40,046 --> 01:17:42,266
I mean, wanted a child.

1220
01:17:44,616 --> 01:17:47,837
Oh lord,
I know this is coming out badly.

1221
01:17:47,880 --> 01:17:49,969
Sonny, listen to me.

1222
01:17:50,013 --> 01:17:53,277
I didn't think you were ever coming back.

1223
01:17:53,320 --> 01:17:55,453
I'm so sorry.

1224
01:17:55,496 --> 01:17:57,368
Listen to me.

1225
01:17:57,411 --> 01:18:00,023
When a person

1226
01:18:00,066 --> 01:18:02,765
gives away a child
in this state,

1227
01:18:02,808 --> 01:18:06,029
they have 60 days to reconsider.

1228
01:18:06,072 --> 01:18:08,422
Estelle, you won't want
to reconsider.

1229
01:18:08,466 --> 01:18:10,903
This child will have
the best home

1230
01:18:10,947 --> 01:18:12,949
any child ever had.

1231
01:18:12,992 --> 01:18:16,430
I've got pictures
of my home in Lake Tahoe.

1232
01:18:16,474 --> 01:18:18,345
And Evaline...

1233
01:18:18,389 --> 01:18:21,348
Is the most loving woman

1234
01:18:21,392 --> 01:18:23,002
you will ever meet.

1235
01:18:23,046 --> 01:18:26,179
It wasn't easy for me to
tell her about the baby.

1236
01:18:26,223 --> 01:18:30,009
But when I did,
and about how hard it must be for you

1237
01:18:30,053 --> 01:18:32,316
working in a casino at night,

1238
01:18:32,359 --> 01:18:34,840
it brought tears to her eyes.

1239
01:18:36,668 --> 01:18:38,801
I've already started
a college fund.

1240
01:18:40,803 --> 01:18:42,805
I've got papers.

1241
01:18:42,848 --> 01:18:44,241
I could leave them with you,

1242
01:18:44,284 --> 01:18:46,112
or you could
sign them right now.

1243
01:18:46,156 --> 01:18:48,767
I'm really prepared
to take her at anytime.

1244
01:18:59,169 --> 01:19:01,171
Hey, hey!

1245
01:19:02,955 --> 01:19:06,654
Sonny came back for his baby.

1246
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:09,005
He started a college fund.

1247
01:19:09,048 --> 01:19:11,094
Okay, Estelle,
just take it easy.

1248
01:19:13,183 --> 01:19:16,012
Maybe I oughta just take
hold of my little girl.

1249
01:19:16,055 --> 01:19:19,406
- What's going on here?
- That is not your baby.

1250
01:19:19,450 --> 01:19:22,148
You dumb son of a bitch.

1251
01:19:22,192 --> 01:19:25,412
- Your baby's gone.
- What are you talking about?

1252
01:19:25,456 --> 01:19:27,414
- This is mine!
- Like hell it is.

1253
01:19:27,458 --> 01:19:29,547
- It will be!
- He's paying $10,000.

1254
01:19:29,590 --> 01:19:32,985
- Over my dead body!
- Hey, this is not your baby!

1255
01:19:33,029 --> 01:19:35,596
Why don't you go back
to where you came from.

1256
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:37,076
Loozy, you mind
your own business.

1257
01:19:37,120 --> 01:19:38,948
Let the little man
fight his own battle.

1258
01:19:38,991 --> 01:19:41,211
At least I don't
fight women like you.

1259
01:19:44,040 --> 01:19:46,085
You got her papers, right?
From the hospital?

1260
01:19:46,129 --> 01:19:48,479
Yeah, right here.

1261
01:19:49,654 --> 01:19:51,351
Look.

1262
01:19:51,395 --> 01:19:53,440
Father.
That's me.

1263
01:19:53,484 --> 01:19:55,616
And that's her heel print.

1264
01:19:55,660 --> 01:19:57,662
They got a Polaroid
picture on file.

1265
01:19:59,403 --> 01:20:03,363
Your baby was adopted, Sonny.

1266
01:20:03,407 --> 01:20:05,757
I gave it away.

1267
01:20:05,801 --> 01:20:07,672
To who?

1268
01:20:07,715 --> 01:20:09,935
Probably some dirt farmer

1269
01:20:09,979 --> 01:20:12,242
who'll be fucking her
by the time she's 10.

1270
01:20:12,285 --> 01:20:14,157
Shut your mouth.

1271
01:20:14,200 --> 01:20:15,811
It wasn't a girl, Sonny.

1272
01:20:15,854 --> 01:20:17,638
It was a boy.

1273
01:20:19,640 --> 01:20:21,686
Did it take after me?

1274
01:20:21,729 --> 01:20:25,995
It did seem to fill its
diapers, as I recall.

1275
01:20:37,571 --> 01:20:40,574
My fiancée will be
very disappointed.

1276
01:20:42,272 --> 01:20:44,622
Very.

1277
01:20:44,665 --> 01:20:46,624
You could use that.

1278
01:20:46,667 --> 01:20:49,061
Good luck.

1279
01:20:54,632 --> 01:20:56,852
Have you got something
to settle with me, boy?

1280
01:20:56,895 --> 01:20:58,157
- Yeah, I do.
- What?

1281
01:20:58,201 --> 01:21:00,899
You touch her one more time,
I'm calling the cops.

1282
01:21:00,943 --> 01:21:03,206
That's interesting,
considering you're a wanted man.

1283
01:21:03,249 --> 01:21:05,034
And I know how
you got that baby.

1284
01:21:05,077 --> 01:21:07,036
- What if I call the cops?
- You just try it.

1285
01:21:07,079 --> 01:21:09,168
- Shut up.
- I'll call them right now!

1286
01:21:09,212 --> 01:21:11,605
- Just forget it, Billy.
- I will call them now!

1287
01:21:11,649 --> 01:21:12,955
- You will?
- Yes!

1288
01:21:12,998 --> 01:21:14,565
Well, let me give you a reason!

1289
01:21:14,608 --> 01:21:16,567
Take her away!

1290
01:21:16,610 --> 01:21:18,351
- Hey!
- You guys want to save her?!

1291
01:21:18,395 --> 01:21:20,005
Come on outside.
Come on outside!

1292
01:21:20,049 --> 01:21:22,007
Please!

1293
01:21:22,051 --> 01:21:24,923
Let her go!

1294
01:21:27,099 --> 01:21:29,972
You don't understand, Billy,
it makes her so hot.

1295
01:21:30,015 --> 01:21:32,888
Doesn't it?!
Does it make you hot?

1296
01:21:32,931 --> 01:21:35,194
You try to stop me,
she'll kill you!

1297
01:21:35,238 --> 01:21:37,153
- Would you shoot him?
- You take her!

1298
01:21:37,196 --> 01:21:40,025
- Don't do it! He'll kill you!
- Leave her alone!

1299
01:22:03,048 --> 01:22:04,571
Verne!

1300
01:22:04,615 --> 01:22:06,617
Let me do it!

1301
01:22:06,660 --> 01:22:08,488
Verne!

1302
01:22:08,532 --> 01:22:10,708
Get out of the way!

1303
01:22:10,751 --> 01:22:13,232
- Loozy?!
- What are you doing?

1304
01:22:13,276 --> 01:22:15,974
I'm teaching him a lesson.

1305
01:22:16,018 --> 01:22:18,324
He's done nothing
but mess with me,

1306
01:22:18,368 --> 01:22:19,978
since the day he came!

1307
01:22:20,022 --> 01:22:23,895
Verne, I'll kill him myself!
Get out of the way!

1308
01:22:23,939 --> 01:22:26,028
Stand away!

1309
01:22:26,071 --> 01:22:29,074
If you don't,
I'll get both of you!

1310
01:22:35,646 --> 01:22:37,909
Loozy?!

1311
01:22:46,439 --> 01:22:49,094
Loozy! Loozy!

1312
01:22:51,096 --> 01:22:53,185
Let me in, honey!
Loozy!

1313
01:23:13,075 --> 01:23:15,207
Almighty god.

1314
01:24:06,084 --> 01:24:08,521
I don't know where else
to look for her.

1315
01:24:10,523 --> 01:24:12,438
I even went down to the boat

1316
01:24:12,482 --> 01:24:15,572
and they were getting real edgy.

1317
01:24:15,615 --> 01:24:19,054
Verne was supposed to take
out a day cruise at 3:00.

1318
01:24:19,097 --> 01:24:22,100
And they called his mama in
Reno to see if he was there.

1319
01:24:22,144 --> 01:24:25,625
She got all upset.
She's afraid someone kidnapped him.

1320
01:24:25,669 --> 01:24:27,671
Who'd want him?

1321
01:24:29,064 --> 01:24:30,630
Oh my god.

1322
01:24:30,674 --> 01:24:33,677
I think we're all going to
have to get out of here.

1323
01:24:40,249 --> 01:24:42,425
I've been wondering
if all this happened

1324
01:24:42,468 --> 01:24:44,470
'cause I gave my baby away.

1325
01:24:47,691 --> 01:24:49,693
And I been wondering,

1326
01:24:51,477 --> 01:24:55,220
if that kid

1327
01:24:55,264 --> 01:24:57,875
thinks he can do it,

1328
01:24:57,918 --> 01:25:00,095
why can't I?

1329
01:25:08,146 --> 01:25:09,452
Oh, man.

1330
01:25:09,495 --> 01:25:11,889
- Shouldn't we say something?
- Say something?

1331
01:25:11,932 --> 01:25:13,499
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

1332
01:25:17,503 --> 01:25:19,723
- I'd just like to say,
- mmm.

1333
01:25:21,072 --> 01:25:23,205
As his soul leaves this earth,

1334
01:25:24,902 --> 01:25:27,513
I feel sorry
for whoever gets it.

1335
01:25:27,557 --> 01:25:29,559
Amen.

1336
01:25:33,693 --> 01:25:35,260
Jesus!

1337
01:25:41,266 --> 01:25:44,051
Now, I don't advise
a life of crime, little one,

1338
01:25:44,095 --> 01:25:46,967
but we had the gun now,
a pair of masks

1339
01:25:47,011 --> 01:25:48,926
from Stormy's underwear drawer,

1340
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:50,493
and with Buford in charge,

1341
01:25:50,536 --> 01:25:52,451
I was prepared to do
whatever it took

1342
01:25:52,495 --> 01:25:54,714
to make you mine.

1343
01:25:59,545 --> 01:26:01,460
We're getting there.

1344
01:26:06,770 --> 01:26:08,424
I can't see for shit.

1345
01:26:11,253 --> 01:26:13,255
You oughta push that up.

1346
01:26:20,131 --> 01:26:23,047
- She wear these?
- Somebody did.

1347
01:26:23,090 --> 01:26:25,049
Smells like a man.

1348
01:26:25,092 --> 01:26:27,138
We're here.

1349
01:26:30,054 --> 01:26:32,839
All right, let's go.

1350
01:26:32,883 --> 01:26:34,276
Look!

1351
01:26:36,103 --> 01:26:37,714
Shit!

1352
01:26:37,757 --> 01:26:40,412
- There's people in there.
- They're taking the jewels.

1353
01:26:40,456 --> 01:26:43,198
- We're too late.
- No, no.

1354
01:26:43,241 --> 01:26:45,112
We're just in time, I'd say.

1355
01:26:45,156 --> 01:26:47,245
What about the people?

1356
01:26:47,289 --> 01:26:50,205
Just say,
"get your hands up."

1357
01:26:50,248 --> 01:26:51,684
What if they won't?

1358
01:26:51,728 --> 01:26:54,513
- "Hands up, or else."
- Should I wait here?

1359
01:26:56,123 --> 01:26:58,256
No, why don't you
take in a movie

1360
01:26:58,300 --> 01:27:00,258
and just drop by
when you feel like it?

1361
01:27:00,302 --> 01:27:04,393
- Of course, you should wait here!
- I thought maybe the alley,

1362
01:27:04,436 --> 01:27:07,047
beside the building.
There's a side door.

1363
01:27:07,091 --> 01:27:09,267
Fine! Whatever!

1364
01:27:09,311 --> 01:27:11,182
Let's go!

1365
01:27:15,099 --> 01:27:17,057
Who's going first?

1366
01:27:17,101 --> 01:27:19,451
- You go first.
- You got the gun!

1367
01:27:19,495 --> 01:27:21,671
- You go first.
- Shit!

1368
01:27:21,714 --> 01:27:24,108
Will you quite littering?!

1369
01:27:26,502 --> 01:27:28,504
- Nobody move!
- Hands up!

1370
01:27:28,547 --> 01:27:30,157
- Or else!
- Or else!

1371
01:27:30,201 --> 01:27:34,684
- What the fuck?!
- I thought they were you.

1372
01:27:34,727 --> 01:27:36,251
He's got a gun!

1373
01:27:40,516 --> 01:27:43,214
Bue!
Bue, your ear!

1374
01:27:43,258 --> 01:27:44,998
- What?!
- It's off!

1375
01:27:45,042 --> 01:27:47,087
- I don't need it!
- But...

1376
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:50,265
Drop them jewels!

1377
01:27:53,137 --> 01:27:55,313
Not the window!

1378
01:27:57,010 --> 01:28:00,797
Get that motherfucker!

1379
01:28:00,840 --> 01:28:02,755
Get the jewels!

1380
01:28:10,023 --> 01:28:11,721
Oh baby!

1381
01:28:13,331 --> 01:28:15,115
Oh sweetie!

1382
01:28:18,205 --> 01:28:20,991
And I want my thousand back!

1383
01:28:21,034 --> 01:28:22,209
Whew!

1384
01:28:38,356 --> 01:28:40,967
Bue, don't shoot him!
He lost his gun!

1385
01:28:41,011 --> 01:28:43,100
What?!
I'll get him!

1386
01:28:57,114 --> 01:28:59,116
What the fuck?!

1387
01:29:05,383 --> 01:29:07,298
Motherfucker!

1388
01:29:07,342 --> 01:29:09,953
Bue!

1389
01:29:14,436 --> 01:29:16,133
No!

1390
01:29:28,363 --> 01:29:30,365
Don't move!

1391
01:29:48,426 --> 01:29:50,385
I got my guitar.

1392
01:30:10,970 --> 01:30:13,277
I love you, man.

1393
01:30:17,934 --> 01:30:20,153
I love you, too.

1394
01:30:23,940 --> 01:30:26,072
Go.

1395
01:30:26,116 --> 01:30:27,726
Go.

1396
01:30:29,511 --> 01:30:31,643
Get out of here.

1397
01:30:58,365 --> 01:31:01,281
They say the journey
of 1000 miles

1398
01:31:01,325 --> 01:31:03,893
begins with a single step.

1399
01:31:05,155 --> 01:31:07,200
What they don't tell you is

1400
01:31:07,244 --> 01:31:09,986
it ends that way as well.

1401
01:31:14,556 --> 01:31:16,993
Mr. Pinkney?

1402
01:31:17,036 --> 01:31:19,125
No, no, I know the time
is up, sir,

1403
01:31:19,169 --> 01:31:21,345
but if I could, if I could...

1404
01:31:21,388 --> 01:31:24,522
No, I'm sure
it's a very good photo

1405
01:31:24,566 --> 01:31:26,132
you have of me, but...

1406
01:31:26,176 --> 01:31:28,091
No, I know you're not kidding.

1407
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:29,571
Mr. Pinkney...

1408
01:31:31,790 --> 01:31:33,662
I love this baby.

1409
01:31:39,406 --> 01:31:42,061
Yes, sir.

1410
01:31:42,105 --> 01:31:44,107
Till tomorrow at 5:00.

1411
01:31:48,590 --> 01:31:51,114
I never thought much
about tomorrows, little one.

1412
01:31:51,157 --> 01:31:55,031
But that night,
I wasn't much looking forward to dawn.

1413
01:31:56,989 --> 01:32:00,558
I was an escaped prisoner
with a kidnapped baby.

1414
01:32:00,602 --> 01:32:03,692
Loozy was gone,
and so was Buford.

1415
01:32:05,041 --> 01:32:07,217
But that's the thing
about tomorrows...

1416
01:32:07,260 --> 01:32:09,393
You never know
what they'll bring.

1417
01:32:09,436 --> 01:32:11,961
Billy! Billy!

1418
01:32:12,004 --> 01:32:14,224
Quick!

1419
01:32:17,967 --> 01:32:21,536
"A struggling musician,
pawning his beloved guitar,

1420
01:32:21,579 --> 01:32:24,016
was confronted
by two jewel thieves,

1421
01:32:24,060 --> 01:32:26,802
now dead, because
they underestimated

1422
01:32:26,845 --> 01:32:29,587
the courage
of this quiet man."

1423
01:32:29,631 --> 01:32:31,328
Where do they get this shit?

1424
01:32:31,371 --> 01:32:33,112
He can't even play the guitar.

1425
01:32:33,156 --> 01:32:35,811
It's Huntoon,
that pawn shop guy.

1426
01:32:35,854 --> 01:32:39,292
He figured if Buford had
to stand trial for burglary,

1427
01:32:39,336 --> 01:32:41,164
he'd spill everything
he ever knew.

1428
01:32:41,207 --> 01:32:44,167
- I won't believe he'd tell.
- He has risen from the dead.

1429
01:32:44,210 --> 01:32:47,213
If he speaks,
he speaks in the voice of a shaman.

1430
01:32:47,257 --> 01:32:48,388
If he has fingered Loozy,

1431
01:32:48,432 --> 01:32:51,174
I will rip
his damn vocal cords out.

1432
01:32:52,610 --> 01:32:54,960
Dr. Peterson to radiology.

1433
01:32:55,004 --> 01:32:58,268
Dr. Peterson to radiology.

1434
01:33:05,797 --> 01:33:07,320
Sorry, no babies.

1435
01:33:07,364 --> 01:33:09,801
And just one at a time, please.

1436
01:33:25,164 --> 01:33:27,166
Hey, bue.

1437
01:33:39,614 --> 01:33:43,487
Did we get the jewels, Billy?

1438
01:33:46,708 --> 01:33:48,274
Uh-uh.

1439
01:33:59,721 --> 01:34:02,637
I'm taking the baby
on the run, Buford,

1440
01:34:05,204 --> 01:34:08,294
that's why I need you
to be quiet about everything.

1441
01:34:09,295 --> 01:34:12,385
Don't tell about me
and the baby,

1442
01:34:14,387 --> 01:34:16,302
or the robbery,

1443
01:34:16,346 --> 01:34:19,131
or Verne, or Loozy.

1444
01:34:19,175 --> 01:34:22,004
You'll wreck it for all of us.

1445
01:34:23,179 --> 01:34:25,964
Is Tess here yet?

1446
01:34:30,926 --> 01:34:32,841
I never new a woman...

1447
01:34:32,884 --> 01:34:35,321
Did you, Billy?

1448
01:34:35,365 --> 01:34:38,107
Who always had 'em.

1449
01:34:39,238 --> 01:34:41,327
Had what, Buford?

1450
01:34:43,286 --> 01:34:45,897
Hard nipples.

1451
01:34:50,597 --> 01:34:52,991
She here yet?

1452
01:34:55,428 --> 01:34:58,170
Tess.

1453
01:35:09,225 --> 01:35:11,618
Well, what did he say?

1454
01:35:11,662 --> 01:35:14,752
Hi, how's she doing?

1455
01:35:14,796 --> 01:35:18,103
- Good.
- Is this your family?

1456
01:35:18,147 --> 01:35:20,758
Uh, yeah.

1457
01:35:20,802 --> 01:35:22,760
- This is my sister.
- Hello.

1458
01:35:22,804 --> 01:35:25,371
- Hi.
- This is my other sister.

1459
01:35:25,415 --> 01:35:27,547
- Oh, hi.
- And this is my uncle Dog.

1460
01:35:27,591 --> 01:35:29,245
Hi.

1461
01:35:29,288 --> 01:35:32,117
I'm impressed that you all came.
It's what a baby needs.

1462
01:35:32,161 --> 01:35:34,293
"It takes a village,"
as they say.

1463
01:35:34,337 --> 01:35:35,860
- Uh-huh.
- You know what?

1464
01:35:35,904 --> 01:35:39,211
It's a little early,
but we can start heading over there now.

1465
01:35:40,647 --> 01:35:44,390
Dawn breaks on a special day,

1466
01:35:44,434 --> 01:35:47,785
the day your new baby arrives.

1467
01:35:47,829 --> 01:35:51,180
A precious bundle awaited
with eager anticipation

1468
01:35:51,223 --> 01:35:53,051
by the entire family.

1469
01:35:54,226 --> 01:35:56,185
It's not just mom's job now,

1470
01:35:56,228 --> 01:35:59,405
it's dad's as well.
Brothers and sisters, too.

1471
01:35:59,449 --> 01:36:02,017
For family stability is the key

1472
01:36:02,060 --> 01:36:04,933
to raising a happy,
healthy child.

1473
01:36:04,976 --> 01:36:07,413
Dad, you promised us
you'd get ice cream.

1474
01:36:07,457 --> 01:36:08,763
I did, didn't I?

1475
01:36:08,806 --> 01:36:11,330
In short, parenting requires

1476
01:36:11,374 --> 01:36:14,377
the talents of a juggler
and the patience of a Saint.

1477
01:36:14,420 --> 01:36:18,163
Remember, your child
didn't choose you,

1478
01:36:18,207 --> 01:36:20,818
you chose it.

1479
01:36:20,862 --> 01:36:23,386
And it's your sacred
responsibility now

1480
01:36:23,429 --> 01:36:25,475
to give it the most
nurturing home

1481
01:36:25,518 --> 01:36:27,564
that any parent could provide.

1482
01:36:36,834 --> 01:36:39,532
That guy...

1483
01:36:39,576 --> 01:36:41,578
The father of your baby?

1484
01:36:42,709 --> 01:36:44,711
He seemed nice.

1485
01:36:47,410 --> 01:36:50,065
He said he already had
a college fund put away,

1486
01:36:50,108 --> 01:36:53,111
and that his wife would
be real disappointed.

1487
01:36:55,200 --> 01:36:57,376
I guess they really
wanted a baby.

1488
01:37:00,423 --> 01:37:04,209
You said so yourself.
What have I got to give a baby, huh?

1489
01:37:04,253 --> 01:37:07,517
You said so yourself.
Love was enough.

1490
01:37:07,560 --> 01:37:09,171
With the police
after me? No money,

1491
01:37:09,214 --> 01:37:12,478
no home, no job, no future.

1492
01:37:12,522 --> 01:37:16,613
My face on every paper
from here to Chickeesaw.

1493
01:37:16,656 --> 01:37:19,007
- A child is not a tumbleweed.
- He had his baby.

1494
01:37:19,050 --> 01:37:21,009
- He didn't want it.
- He wanted it.

1495
01:37:21,052 --> 01:37:23,315
A seedling needs rich soil.

1496
01:37:23,359 --> 01:37:25,448
What the fuck
are you talking about?

1497
01:37:25,491 --> 01:37:28,364
The thirsty one
is still thirsty.

1498
01:37:30,322 --> 01:37:33,412
Don't do this to me.

1499
01:37:33,456 --> 01:37:35,023
I'm on the run, Estelle.

1500
01:37:35,066 --> 01:37:36,763
Not anymore, you're not.

1501
01:37:56,740 --> 01:37:58,263
Billy Rae in here?

1502
01:37:58,307 --> 01:38:01,397
- Billy Raedeen?
- Who?

1503
01:38:01,440 --> 01:38:03,051
No. Uh-uh.

1504
01:38:03,094 --> 01:38:04,617
Do you know him?

1505
01:38:04,661 --> 01:38:07,446
No, sure don't.

1506
01:38:10,058 --> 01:38:12,277
If you see him,
tell him to call this number.

1507
01:38:12,321 --> 01:38:14,105
Oh, okay.

1508
01:38:14,149 --> 01:38:16,368
We found the girl
who killed Verne Gacey,

1509
01:38:16,412 --> 01:38:18,240
right where his note
said we would.

1510
01:38:18,283 --> 01:38:20,851
She confessed to the crime

1511
01:38:20,895 --> 01:38:22,679
and led us to the body.

1512
01:38:23,898 --> 01:38:27,292
Which makes the conviction
just a formality.

1513
01:38:27,336 --> 01:38:30,992
Likely he's gonna get the $10,000
the family posted as a reward.

1514
01:38:35,257 --> 01:38:37,694
Whole lot easier this way.

1515
01:38:40,392 --> 01:38:44,092
Well, good day to you.

1516
01:38:47,095 --> 01:38:50,054
Turns out it was Loozy herself
who sent the note

1517
01:38:50,098 --> 01:38:52,317
supposedly signed by me,

1518
01:38:52,361 --> 01:38:54,624
identifying herself
as the killer.

1519
01:38:54,667 --> 01:38:58,454
And Loozy herself who called
Verne's rich mama in Reno,

1520
01:38:58,497 --> 01:39:02,371
advising a $10,000 reward
would bring quick results.

1521
01:39:08,464 --> 01:39:11,858
What exactly possessed her
to give up everything for you,

1522
01:39:11,902 --> 01:39:14,252
I'll never know.

1523
01:39:14,296 --> 01:39:16,298
What she told me was,

1524
01:39:16,341 --> 01:39:18,735
they had a great library
in that prison,

1525
01:39:18,778 --> 01:39:22,782
and she'd always dreamed of
having nothing to do but read.

1526
01:39:34,446 --> 01:39:37,449
- Did you pay Pinkney, yet?
- I did.

1527
01:39:39,451 --> 01:39:41,366
Did you get the papers?

1528
01:39:41,410 --> 01:39:44,326
And he got his evinrude.

1529
01:39:49,374 --> 01:39:51,855
They say if I'm a good girl,

1530
01:39:51,898 --> 01:39:55,337
I can get out of here
in seven years.

1531
01:39:59,036 --> 01:40:00,995
Which means I got
to start reading fast.

1532
01:40:01,038 --> 01:40:04,172
I mean, the National
Geographics alone...

1533
01:40:06,087 --> 01:40:08,132
Will take me...

1534
01:40:16,271 --> 01:40:18,273
Thank you, Loozy.

1535
01:40:21,841 --> 01:40:23,278
I promise you,

1536
01:40:23,321 --> 01:40:25,584
there's nothing
I won't do to make sure

1537
01:40:25,628 --> 01:40:28,674
she gets every chance
at a good life.

1538
01:40:28,718 --> 01:40:30,720
Everything I can.

1539
01:40:32,330 --> 01:40:35,072
I know that.

1540
01:40:35,116 --> 01:40:37,292
That's my sacred obligation now.

1541
01:40:38,815 --> 01:40:42,340
No matter what I suffer,
that's what I gotta do.

1542
01:41:11,848 --> 01:41:13,850
See you, Billy.

1543
01:41:18,115 --> 01:41:19,682
Hey.

1544
01:41:21,901 --> 01:41:23,990
I'll never be far.

1545
01:41:36,916 --> 01:41:39,049
And I never was far.

1546
01:41:39,093 --> 01:41:41,747
Not from her, not you.

1547
01:41:41,791 --> 01:41:43,662
That was part of the deal,

1548
01:41:43,706 --> 01:41:45,751
and why I did what I did.

1549
01:41:45,795 --> 01:41:48,319
So I could be your uncle Billy

1550
01:41:48,363 --> 01:41:50,104
and stay close...

1551
01:41:50,147 --> 01:41:52,062
Always keep an eye on you.

1552
01:41:59,722 --> 01:42:02,116
Now I'll never forget you.

1553
01:42:05,293 --> 01:42:08,383
Because there was someone
who could provide for you,

1554
01:42:08,426 --> 01:42:10,428
someone who wanted a child.

1555
01:42:10,472 --> 01:42:12,735
And even your aunt Estelle
agreed that Sonny

1556
01:42:12,778 --> 01:42:15,085
wasn't such a bad guy after all.

1557
01:42:18,262 --> 01:42:20,395
He promised on the phone
to marry Evaline,

1558
01:42:20,438 --> 01:42:22,875
the woman he was living with,

1559
01:42:22,919 --> 01:42:26,314
which I insisted on before
I'd let you move in there.

1560
01:42:26,357 --> 01:42:28,925
And she didn't seem
to object none either.

1561
01:42:30,405 --> 01:42:32,668
He said he'd buy you
all three outfits...

1562
01:42:32,711 --> 01:42:35,279
One for church,
one to go to school,

1563
01:42:35,323 --> 01:42:37,934
and one just to get dirty.

1564
01:42:40,154 --> 01:42:42,112
He said you'd have
your own room,

1565
01:42:42,156 --> 01:42:45,202
a brother or sister
when the time was right,

1566
01:42:45,246 --> 01:42:49,032
and most important,
you'd keep your own name.

1567
01:42:49,075 --> 01:42:51,208
- What was her birthday again?
- Oh, June 30th.

1568
01:42:51,252 --> 01:42:53,297
- June 30th.
- Little Shauna-Louise.

1569
01:42:53,341 --> 01:42:56,170
You look like an Amy to me.

1570
01:42:56,213 --> 01:42:59,303
Do you like that name, Amy?

1571
01:43:03,525 --> 01:43:06,005
I'll tell you, little one,

1572
01:43:06,049 --> 01:43:08,138
in my lifetime before you,

1573
01:43:08,182 --> 01:43:11,185
it always felt right
to do the wrong thing.

1574
01:43:12,360 --> 01:43:16,190
This felt so wrong,
I knew it must be right.

1575
01:43:33,163 --> 01:43:34,860
Bye, little Loozy.

1576
01:43:47,133 --> 01:43:49,875
And that's why I left you there.

1577
01:43:49,919 --> 01:43:52,269
'Cause they had what I didn't...

1578
01:43:52,313 --> 01:43:54,924
A house, a college fund,

1579
01:43:54,967 --> 01:43:57,622
a real family.

1580
01:43:59,145 --> 01:44:01,452
I knew you'd be
better off there.

1581
01:44:31,961 --> 01:44:34,180
Wait a second...

1582
01:44:36,357 --> 01:44:38,576
Like Estelle said, little one,

1583
01:44:38,620 --> 01:44:41,884
you got 60 days to reconsider
an adoption in this state.

1584
01:44:41,927 --> 01:44:44,930
And I only used up
60 seconds of it.

1585
01:45:00,555 --> 01:45:03,166
I knew they had
the house, the family,

1586
01:45:03,209 --> 01:45:05,342
and the college fund,

1587
01:45:05,386 --> 01:45:08,650
but we're as much
a family as they were.

1588
01:45:08,693 --> 01:45:11,696
And we could start
our own college fund.

1589
01:45:26,407 --> 01:45:29,627
Still, the truest test
is the test of time.

1590
01:45:29,671 --> 01:45:32,978
And in the time that's passed,
many things have changed.

1591
01:45:34,197 --> 01:45:37,418
Among them, your uncle
Buford, who did recover.

1592
01:45:37,461 --> 01:45:39,681
But in a way like
Dog predicted...

1593
01:45:39,724 --> 01:45:42,248
Like a holy man.

1594
01:45:43,337 --> 01:45:46,688
Having been put in touch with a
monastery in Napa, California,

1595
01:45:46,731 --> 01:45:48,603
he went there to serve
the brothers.

1596
01:45:48,646 --> 01:45:51,127
But when I heard this was
known as wine country,

1597
01:45:51,170 --> 01:45:53,999
I wondered if he'd
changed that much after all.

1598
01:45:58,352 --> 01:46:00,397
Your aunt Estelle tried,
but failed,

1599
01:46:00,441 --> 01:46:01,920
to get her baby back...

1600
01:46:01,964 --> 01:46:03,313
The 60 days being up.

1601
01:46:03,357 --> 01:46:05,707
But she did find out
it was in good hands,

1602
01:46:05,750 --> 01:46:08,187
having been adopted
by a newly married

1603
01:46:08,231 --> 01:46:10,059
air conditioner repair man.

1604
01:46:10,102 --> 01:46:12,104
They're always in demand.

1605
01:46:13,192 --> 01:46:15,238
I lost touch with Stormy,

1606
01:46:15,281 --> 01:46:17,153
but got a postcard indicating

1607
01:46:17,196 --> 01:46:19,155
she was still
kicking high enough.

1608
01:46:19,198 --> 01:46:21,462
And one from Dog,
letting me know

1609
01:46:21,505 --> 01:46:23,377
he'd achieved his dream.

1610
01:46:25,379 --> 01:46:29,426
Speaking of dreams,
I've still got a few.

1611
01:46:29,470 --> 01:46:31,428
And so does Loozy.

1612
01:46:31,472 --> 01:46:34,779
'Cause it seems like seven
years is going by pretty fast.

1613
01:46:35,954 --> 01:46:37,913
We talk about when she gets out

1614
01:46:37,956 --> 01:46:40,219
maybe getting together.

1615
01:46:40,263 --> 01:46:41,743
Who knows,

1616
01:46:41,786 --> 01:46:44,702
we might make a nice family
for you some day.

1617
01:46:45,877 --> 01:46:48,489
'Cause we're none
of us cactuses, little one.

1618
01:46:49,751 --> 01:46:52,406
We all need to be touched.

1619
01:46:55,539 --> 01:46:59,413
Sincerely yours forever,

1620
01:47:00,979 --> 01:47:03,329
love always...

1621
01:47:03,373 --> 01:47:05,419
Dad.

1622
01:47:07,203 --> 01:47:10,511
PS. Happy birthday.

1623
01:47:10,554 --> 01:47:12,426
Happy birthday.

1624
01:47:25,395 --> 01:47:27,397
