00:01:00,970 --> 00:01:02,504
All right, ladies!

3
00:01:02,571 --> 00:01:04,104
Everyone up!

4
00:01:04,170 --> 00:01:07,304
On your feet now! Up!
Everyone out of the water!

5
00:01:07,371 --> 00:01:10,070
Move it! Move!
On your feet!

6
00:01:10,137 --> 00:01:13,137
( <i>women screaming</i> )
Now! Let's go!

7
00:01:13,204 --> 00:01:15,204
Move now! Let's go!

8
00:01:15,271 --> 00:01:17,937
Hold it! Down on the ground,
right now! Do it!

9
00:01:26,571 --> 00:01:29,671
All right, everybody through
being heroes now, huh?!

10
00:01:29,738 --> 00:01:31,004
Move it!

11
00:01:31,070 --> 00:01:32,770
Everyone in the lockers!

12
00:01:38,870 --> 00:01:40,903
Come on now!
Get in there now!

13
00:01:40,970 --> 00:01:45,104
I want those lockers
open now!

14
00:01:45,170 --> 00:01:48,137
I want your purses in my bag
and your keys in my hand!

15
00:01:48,204 --> 00:01:49,903
Hurry it up!
Give me that.

16
00:01:49,970 --> 00:01:52,004
Come on. Let's go.

17
00:01:52,070 --> 00:01:53,137
You, where's your keys?

18
00:01:53,204 --> 00:01:55,970
Oh...
Hurry up!

19
00:01:56,037 --> 00:01:56,937
Come on. Hurry up!

20
00:02:11,504 --> 00:02:14,803
Somebody... help me, please.

21
00:02:14,870 --> 00:02:16,571
I've been shot.

22
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:19,638
Come on. Let's go.
Let's go.

23
00:02:19,704 --> 00:02:21,803
We got 'em. We got 'em.
Let's go. Let's go.

24
00:02:32,204 --> 00:02:33,304
The keys...
Come on!

25
00:02:34,903 --> 00:02:38,304
Which one goes to which car?

26
00:02:47,004 --> 00:02:49,070
Frank?

27
00:02:49,137 --> 00:02:51,671
Three men in masks,
armed robbery.

28
00:02:51,738 --> 00:02:53,437
Weird thing is,
they weren't even armed

29
00:02:53,504 --> 00:02:55,671
before they took the gun
off the security guard.

30
00:02:55,738 --> 00:02:57,504
Dispatch says shots fired,
Frank.

31
00:02:57,571 --> 00:03:00,404
Yeah. Victoria Morena
fought back with OC spray.

32
00:03:00,471 --> 00:03:02,070
Took one in the chest
for it.

33
00:03:02,137 --> 00:03:03,437
She had pepper spray.

34
00:03:03,504 --> 00:03:05,271
Yeah, which means one
of our guys has got Mace face.

35
00:03:05,337 --> 00:03:06,571
When we find him,
we'll know it.

36
00:03:06,638 --> 00:03:08,337
And all the hospitals
have been contacted.

37
00:03:08,404 --> 00:03:09,571
How's she doing?

38
00:03:09,638 --> 00:03:11,170
She's, uh, hanging
in there for now.

39
00:03:11,237 --> 00:03:12,504
She's with
the paramedics.

40
00:03:12,571 --> 00:03:14,337
You're going
to be okay.

41
00:03:15,671 --> 00:03:18,237
All right, witnesses?

42
00:03:20,504 --> 00:03:21,903
What's going on?

43
00:03:21,970 --> 00:03:24,571
Horatio, there's something
you ought to know.

44
00:03:24,638 --> 00:03:27,803
She's okay, but, uh,
one of the witnesses is Marisol.

45
00:03:30,037 --> 00:03:32,070
CAINE:
Give us a minute, please.
Will you?

46
00:03:32,137 --> 00:03:33,371
Marisol...

47
00:03:33,437 --> 00:03:37,237
The one day I decide
to pamper myself, right?

48
00:03:37,304 --> 00:03:38,770
Marisol, I don't like
the look of that.

49
00:03:38,837 --> 00:03:40,271
I'm going to send you
to the hospital

50
00:03:40,337 --> 00:03:41,903
and have you
checked out.
No, I'm fine.

51
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:42,937
I... I just fell.

52
00:03:43,004 --> 00:03:45,204
Marisol, what happened?

53
00:03:45,271 --> 00:03:46,504
I don't know.

54
00:03:46,571 --> 00:03:48,304
It... just happened so fast.

55
00:03:48,371 --> 00:03:50,638
They were just suddenly there,
and...

56
00:03:50,704 --> 00:03:54,604
I keep seeing them--
you know, those masks.

57
00:03:54,671 --> 00:03:57,237
Let's go!
( <i>women screaming</i> )

58
00:03:57,304 --> 00:03:58,504
Move!

59
00:04:00,137 --> 00:04:03,137
Horatio,
you get them. Okay?

60
00:04:05,937 --> 00:04:07,504
I will.

 <font color="#ffff00">www.1000fr.com</font>

63
00:04:57,774 --> 00:05:00,140
Horatio, looks like cars
were the focus.

64
00:05:00,207 --> 00:05:02,407
The type of rides parked
outside this place

65
00:05:02,474 --> 00:05:03,674
was like an invitation.

66
00:05:03,741 --> 00:05:04,807
What'd they get, Frank?

67
00:05:04,874 --> 00:05:06,741
Lambo, Viper,
Aston Martin.

68
00:05:06,807 --> 00:05:08,607
Not bad for a day's work.

69
00:05:08,674 --> 00:05:12,541
The good news is these exotic
cars all had tracking devices.

70
00:05:12,607 --> 00:05:14,607
CAINE:
Okay, put out
a broadcast.

71
00:05:14,674 --> 00:05:15,674
DELKO:
H! Hey, H!

72
00:05:15,741 --> 00:05:17,841
Where's my sister?

73
00:05:17,908 --> 00:05:19,340
She's at the hospital.
She's going to be fine.

74
00:05:19,407 --> 00:05:20,641
What happened?

75
00:05:20,707 --> 00:05:21,807
She's got a gash over the eye,

76
00:05:21,874 --> 00:05:22,974
and I think she may
have a concussion,

77
00:05:23,040 --> 00:05:24,140
but she's going to be fine.

78
00:05:24,207 --> 00:05:25,140
I'm going to the hospital.

79
00:05:25,207 --> 00:05:27,173
Eric, she's going to be okay.

80
00:05:27,240 --> 00:05:28,941
I need you here.

81
00:05:29,008 --> 00:05:31,874
I'll call you from the hospital
when I get something.

82
00:05:43,374 --> 00:05:44,974
You guys detectives?
CSIs.

83
00:05:45,040 --> 00:05:46,474
Found something
weird on the victim

84
00:05:46,541 --> 00:05:48,040
you should
know about.
What's that?

85
00:05:48,107 --> 00:05:49,674
Blood spray
around her mouth.

86
00:05:49,741 --> 00:05:51,807
What's weird about that?
Someone gave her CPR?

87
00:05:51,874 --> 00:05:54,240
MAN:
One, two, three, four...

88
00:05:56,140 --> 00:05:57,574
It was there
when we found her.

89
00:05:57,641 --> 00:05:59,974
Maybe a civilian revived her.

90
00:06:00,040 --> 00:06:00,974
Did a good job, too.

91
00:06:01,040 --> 00:06:02,140
It's why she's alive.

92
00:06:02,207 --> 00:06:04,073
I wonder why they
didn't say anything.

93
00:06:04,140 --> 00:06:05,507
Maybe they helped her
out of guilt.

94
00:06:05,574 --> 00:06:06,641
You think whoever helped her

95
00:06:06,707 --> 00:06:07,807
could be involved
in the robbery?

96
00:06:07,874 --> 00:06:09,641
I'll ask around
and find out.

97
00:06:09,707 --> 00:06:11,340
I'm going to go inside
and look for a casing.

98
00:06:11,407 --> 00:06:12,807
PARAMEDIC:
Might find
a bullet, too.

99
00:06:12,874 --> 00:06:14,507
Her wound's
a through-
and-through.

100
00:06:15,474 --> 00:06:16,807
Thanks.

101
00:06:19,641 --> 00:06:20,908
Excuse me, guys.

102
00:06:20,974 --> 00:06:22,541
I need to talk to you
for a second.

103
00:06:22,607 --> 00:06:24,173
Oh, yeah, sure.
What's up?

104
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:25,908
Well, thanks for saving
the victim's life.

105
00:06:27,374 --> 00:06:29,774
The blood on your shirt--
you gave her CPR, right?

106
00:06:29,841 --> 00:06:31,774
Oh, yeah.

107
00:06:31,841 --> 00:06:33,674
Uh, my pleasure.

108
00:06:33,741 --> 00:06:35,073
Just glad
I could help.

109
00:06:35,140 --> 00:06:37,574
Just I'm curious.
Why didn't you tell anyone?

110
00:06:37,641 --> 00:06:40,340
She dies,
I get sued.

111
00:06:40,407 --> 00:06:43,374
I understand. No good deed
goes unpunished, right?

112
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,240
Yeah, something like that.

113
00:06:45,307 --> 00:06:46,908
So are we done here?

114
00:06:46,974 --> 00:06:48,908
No, no, no, actually,
we're just...

115
00:06:48,974 --> 00:06:50,140
we're just getting started.

116
00:07:11,941 --> 00:07:13,908
Found you.

117
00:07:21,173 --> 00:07:23,641
I'm, I'm confused, uh...

118
00:07:23,707 --> 00:07:26,140
Pete.
Pete.

119
00:07:26,207 --> 00:07:28,073
No men are allowed
in the women's pool area, right,

120
00:07:28,140 --> 00:07:29,407
not even a massage therapist?

121
00:07:29,474 --> 00:07:32,874
Well... no.

122
00:07:32,941 --> 00:07:35,541
You walked in
after the shooting,

123
00:07:35,607 --> 00:07:37,774
past the sauna where the women
were held, right?

124
00:07:37,841 --> 00:07:38,841
That's right.

125
00:07:38,908 --> 00:07:40,407
How come no one saw you?

126
00:07:40,474 --> 00:07:43,207
Because he came
from the closet.

127
00:07:44,407 --> 00:07:45,474
I found the a peephole
in the wall.

128
00:07:55,841 --> 00:07:57,908
You involved in this, Pete?

129
00:07:59,541 --> 00:08:01,440
You let these men in?

130
00:08:01,507 --> 00:08:02,774
No. No way.

131
00:08:02,841 --> 00:08:03,974
I... just...

132
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:10,841
I watch. That's it.

133
00:08:10,908 --> 00:08:11,974
I don't believe you.

134
00:08:12,040 --> 00:08:13,207
Why not?

135
00:08:13,274 --> 00:08:15,040
Because you lied to me
already twice.

136
00:08:16,741 --> 00:08:19,274
Let's go.

137
00:08:28,340 --> 00:08:29,607
Hey.
Got something?

138
00:08:29,674 --> 00:08:30,941
Yeah. Cooper called.

139
00:08:31,008 --> 00:08:32,941
He accessed
the Viper's GPS unit,

140
00:08:33,008 --> 00:08:35,941
and it's transmitting
from the pier of Miami.

141
00:08:36,008 --> 00:08:37,207
So you think the carjackers

142
00:08:37,274 --> 00:08:38,674
are getting ready to ship it
overseas?

143
00:08:38,741 --> 00:08:40,140
Yeah, looks that way.

144
00:08:40,207 --> 00:08:41,307
I'm going to grab Cooper
in the mobile track unit.

145
00:08:41,374 --> 00:08:42,507
We're going to
find out for sure.

146
00:08:42,574 --> 00:08:44,607
( <i>phone beeping</i> )
All right.

147
00:08:44,674 --> 00:08:46,207
It's Tripp.

148
00:08:46,274 --> 00:08:48,173
Great.

149
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,073
Detain him
till somebody can pick up him.

150
00:08:50,140 --> 00:08:51,707
All right.

151
00:08:51,774 --> 00:08:54,340
Got a guy trying to check
himself into Miami General.

152
00:08:54,407 --> 00:08:55,841
Guess what he got.

153
00:08:55,908 --> 00:08:57,374
Mace burn.

154
00:08:57,440 --> 00:08:58,340
Bingo.

155
00:08:58,407 --> 00:09:00,908
Great. Let's divide and conquer.

156
00:09:00,974 --> 00:09:03,307
Well, that's
gotta hurt.

157
00:09:03,374 --> 00:09:04,974
I got stung by a bee.

158
00:09:05,040 --> 00:09:07,140
It's nothing really.

159
00:09:07,207 --> 00:09:09,474
Enough to get you
in Miami General Hospital.

160
00:09:09,541 --> 00:09:11,340
Yeah, I'm allergic.

161
00:09:11,407 --> 00:09:13,040
But not to bees;
to pepper spray.

162
00:09:13,107 --> 00:09:14,507
Where are your keys?!

163
00:09:14,574 --> 00:09:16,008
You!

164
00:09:16,073 --> 00:09:17,274
Come on. Hurry up!

165
00:09:24,941 --> 00:09:27,941
You robbed the spa this morning,
Billy.

166
00:09:28,008 --> 00:09:31,040
No idea what you're
talking about.

167
00:09:31,107 --> 00:09:33,674
We're talking
about where you got this.

168
00:09:33,741 --> 00:09:36,941
We found it parked around
the corner of the hospital.
It's an Astin Martin

169
00:09:37,008 --> 00:09:40,407
That's a pretty nice car.

170
00:09:40,474 --> 00:09:41,741
It ain't mine, though.

171
00:09:41,807 --> 00:09:43,107
Empty your pockets.

172
00:09:45,173 --> 00:09:47,207
Empty your pockets, Billy.

173
00:10:01,207 --> 00:10:02,440
Well, I guess that clears up
the car thing

174
00:10:02,507 --> 00:10:03,874
since you've got the keys.

175
00:10:03,941 --> 00:10:05,607
CAINE:
And the zip ties
that were used

176
00:10:05,674 --> 00:10:08,474
to bind the security guard
at the spa.

177
00:10:08,541 --> 00:10:09,908
I didn't hurt anybody.

178
00:10:09,974 --> 00:10:11,908
Who are your friends,
Mr. Robinson?

179
00:10:11,974 --> 00:10:14,173
Look, we were just supposed
to tie up the guard, okay?

180
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,741
Nobody was supposed to get hurt.

181
00:10:15,807 --> 00:10:18,307
But they did get hurt, Billy,
didn't they?

182
00:10:18,374 --> 00:10:20,107
Witnesses said
the guy

183
00:10:20,173 --> 00:10:21,541
that got Maced
didn't shoot anyone,

184
00:10:21,607 --> 00:10:22,974
so do yourself a favor

185
00:10:23,040 --> 00:10:24,207
and tell us who did.

186
00:10:24,274 --> 00:10:25,474
I can't.

187
00:10:26,807 --> 00:10:28,507
It's better to be in jail
than dead.

188
00:10:28,574 --> 00:10:30,707
Then jail it is.

189
00:10:41,974 --> 00:10:44,741
Be advised: we followed
the GPS unit of our Viper

190
00:10:44,807 --> 00:10:46,707
to the Lion's Gate Shipyard
on Pike Street.

191
00:10:46,774 --> 00:10:48,741
We're requesting backup, please.
Thank you.

192
00:10:48,807 --> 00:10:49,741
Uh-oh.

193
00:10:49,807 --> 00:10:50,974
WOLFE:
What?

194
00:10:52,741 --> 00:10:54,574
Signal's moving.

195
00:10:54,641 --> 00:10:55,774
Okay, so are we.

196
00:10:55,841 --> 00:10:57,407
Wait. You gotta
stay here, man.

197
00:10:57,474 --> 00:10:58,474
No way.

198
00:10:58,541 --> 00:10:59,841
Cooper, you're unarmed.

199
00:10:59,908 --> 00:11:01,474
Hey, you brought me out here,

200
00:11:01,541 --> 00:11:03,440
 <i>and</i> somebody's gotta
to read the receiver.

201
00:11:03,507 --> 00:11:05,173
Okay. Hang back.

202
00:11:30,107 --> 00:11:31,741
Signal's on the move again.

203
00:11:34,407 --> 00:11:35,807
No way.

204
00:11:35,874 --> 00:11:38,008
Hey, ( <i>whistles</i> ) stop.

205
00:11:38,073 --> 00:11:40,107
Is that the GPS unit?

206
00:11:40,173 --> 00:11:42,173
They took the damn thing
out of the Viper.

207
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,073
I feel stupid.

208
00:11:44,140 --> 00:11:46,974
They could be the stupid ones.
It could give us something.

209
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:48,941
Let's get back
to the lab.

210
00:11:50,541 --> 00:11:51,908
MAN ( <i>over radio</i> ):
 <i>Patrols rolling Code 3</i>

211
00:11:51,974 --> 00:11:55,173
 <i>in pursuit</i>
 <i>of a 2005 Lamborghini, orange,</i>

212
00:11:55,240 --> 00:12:00,607
 <i>Florida license 16W649,</i>
 <i>heading southbound on I-95.</i>

213
00:12:22,607 --> 00:12:24,541
I swear I didn't even
see you guys.

214
00:12:24,607 --> 00:12:28,073
You know, the sun
and my music was blasting.

215
00:12:28,140 --> 00:12:31,841
You got an excuse
for going 150 miles an hour?

216
00:12:33,974 --> 00:12:36,707
Too much caffeine?

217
00:12:36,774 --> 00:12:38,440
What about for shooting
Victoria Morena?

218
00:12:40,140 --> 00:12:41,774
What?
What are you talking about?

219
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:43,173
Talking about
where'd you get

220
00:12:43,240 --> 00:12:45,274
the Lamborghini
from, Andretti?

221
00:12:45,340 --> 00:12:47,107
It's Hayden.
Hayden Cruise.

222
00:12:48,374 --> 00:12:50,774
And I got the car
from my car guy.

223
00:12:50,841 --> 00:12:53,407
He's been looking
for a Lambo for, like
two months for me.

224
00:12:53,474 --> 00:12:54,741
Your car guy?

225
00:12:54,807 --> 00:12:57,008
Yeah, Joe. You can
call him if you want.

226
00:12:57,073 --> 00:12:58,507
Speed dial 11.

227
00:13:00,173 --> 00:13:02,307
The number you are trying
to reach has been disconnected

228
00:13:02,374 --> 00:13:03,807
or is no longer in service.

229
00:13:03,874 --> 00:13:06,008
That's shocking.

230
00:13:06,073 --> 00:13:07,607
It's disconnected.

231
00:13:07,674 --> 00:13:09,173
What?

232
00:13:09,240 --> 00:13:13,073
Hey, look, these cars
are like organs, you know?

233
00:13:13,140 --> 00:13:14,173
You get on a list,
you wait.

234
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:15,774
And then when they call,
you buy it.

235
00:13:15,841 --> 00:13:17,674
Otherwise,
somebody else will.

236
00:13:17,741 --> 00:13:19,874
And you didn't think
the car was maybe stolen?

237
00:13:19,941 --> 00:13:21,240
No, absolutely not.

238
00:13:21,307 --> 00:13:24,140
You got a last name

239
00:13:24,207 --> 00:13:25,974
for this Joe guy?

240
00:13:28,008 --> 00:13:32,040
No. But I gave him, like,
a hundred grand cash.

241
00:13:32,107 --> 00:13:34,307
It's a big chunk
of my trust fund.

242
00:13:34,374 --> 00:13:38,340
That big chunk's
about to be impounded, Hayden.

243
00:13:40,340 --> 00:13:42,474
Hey, if you
catch this guy,

244
00:13:42,541 --> 00:13:44,674
do I get my money back or what?

245
00:13:44,741 --> 00:13:46,240
Look, a woman was shot today.

246
00:13:46,307 --> 00:13:48,541
I'm sorry.

247
00:13:48,607 --> 00:13:51,674
It's just, it's
a lot of money.

248
00:13:51,741 --> 00:13:53,841
Get his car keys.

249
00:13:59,874 --> 00:14:02,207
I heard we recovered
all three stolen cars.

250
00:14:02,274 --> 00:14:03,207
Is that right?

251
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:04,541
Two and a half.

252
00:14:04,607 --> 00:14:06,541
Got the bait and switch
at the shipyard.

253
00:14:06,607 --> 00:14:09,474
All that was left of the Viper
was the tracking device.

254
00:14:09,541 --> 00:14:11,240
You mean
they chopped it.

255
00:14:11,307 --> 00:14:12,607
Yeah, problem is

256
00:14:12,674 --> 00:14:14,008
it looks like they used
an acetylene torch,

257
00:14:14,073 --> 00:14:15,707
and heat doesn't leave
a tool mark.

258
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,974
But the torch
would make it
too hot to handle.

259
00:14:25,040 --> 00:14:26,774
Think he used
something to hold it?

260
00:14:32,607 --> 00:14:33,874
He used a vise grip.

261
00:14:42,707 --> 00:14:45,207
And imperfections can make
a unique match.

262
00:14:45,274 --> 00:14:48,507
I'm going to Impound
to look at recently
chopped cars

263
00:14:48,574 --> 00:14:50,440
to compare tool marks.

264
00:14:50,507 --> 00:14:51,941
Meet me
at the garage.

265
00:14:59,674 --> 00:15:01,507
This one's barely a car.

266
00:15:01,574 --> 00:15:04,140
Better for us. Frame's exposed.

267
00:15:06,440 --> 00:15:08,407
Hey, hand me the magnifier,
would you?

268
00:15:16,307 --> 00:15:17,841
I think I got something.
Hand me the picture

269
00:15:17,908 --> 00:15:20,207
of the GPS from the Viper.

270
00:15:26,374 --> 00:15:27,707
Who's the proud illegal owner

271
00:15:27,774 --> 00:15:30,240
of these tool marks?

272
00:15:30,307 --> 00:15:34,641
This ring was run
by Carvell Watson.

273
00:15:34,707 --> 00:15:38,607
His case is pending
for chopping cars.

274
00:15:38,674 --> 00:15:39,874
He's probably out on bail.

275
00:15:39,941 --> 00:15:41,774
We can change that.

276
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,507
I'll get you an address.

277
00:15:52,641 --> 00:15:53,574
Hi,
Hey.

278
00:15:53,641 --> 00:15:54,807
how you doing?

279
00:15:54,874 --> 00:15:56,008
Good.

280
00:15:56,073 --> 00:15:57,841
What can I do for you?

281
00:15:57,908 --> 00:15:59,374
Save my life, I hope.

282
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:00,707
I, uh, got a new car

283
00:16:00,774 --> 00:16:02,340
and I kinda had
a little accident.

284
00:16:02,407 --> 00:16:04,641
Yeah? What kind of car is it?

285
00:16:04,707 --> 00:16:06,607
A Viper SRT.

286
00:16:06,674 --> 00:16:08,807
And what's the damage?

287
00:16:08,874 --> 00:16:11,774
Well, the driver side door
is smushed in.

288
00:16:11,841 --> 00:16:12,974
I can't
even open it.

289
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,240
I called the dealer
about getting

290
00:16:14,307 --> 00:16:16,008
a new one, but they're,
like, five grand.

291
00:16:16,073 --> 00:16:19,173
We might have something for you.

292
00:16:19,240 --> 00:16:21,974
Let me go get the owner.

293
00:16:22,040 --> 00:16:23,474
Thanks.

294
00:16:26,040 --> 00:16:27,240
MAN:
How you doing?

295
00:16:27,307 --> 00:16:29,140
Fine, thanks.

296
00:16:29,207 --> 00:16:30,207
You're lucky.

297
00:16:30,274 --> 00:16:32,440
Got a couple Viper doors
in today.

298
00:16:32,507 --> 00:16:34,908
I bet you did.

299
00:16:36,507 --> 00:16:37,874
Keep your hands

300
00:16:37,941 --> 00:16:39,407
where I can see 'em,
Mr. Watson.

301
00:16:41,974 --> 00:16:43,474
What now?

302
00:16:43,541 --> 00:16:45,340
I'm going to call for a warrant.

303
00:16:45,407 --> 00:16:47,240
I'll let you know
in about two minutes.

304
00:16:54,741 --> 00:16:56,440
Victoria Morena.

305
00:16:56,507 --> 00:16:59,374
Her heart suffered
too much trauma.

306
00:16:59,440 --> 00:17:01,307
She died of cardiac arrest.

307
00:17:01,374 --> 00:17:04,140
Bullets will do that
to you.

308
00:17:04,207 --> 00:17:07,307
So we go from robbery to murder.

309
00:17:07,374 --> 00:17:10,040
Witnesses said
the shooter kicked
her in the head.

310
00:17:10,107 --> 00:17:12,440
Have Delko look
for trace.

311
00:17:13,908 --> 00:17:16,741
The woman you shot this morning
just died, Carvell,

312
00:17:16,807 --> 00:17:18,140
so you're looking at murder.

313
00:17:18,207 --> 00:17:19,674
I didn't shoot anyone.

314
00:17:19,741 --> 00:17:21,641
Somebody's trying
to set me up.

315
00:17:21,707 --> 00:17:23,874
Here's some proof.

316
00:17:23,941 --> 00:17:25,474
Here's a photograph
of the door

317
00:17:25,541 --> 00:17:28,207
from the stolen vehicle
from the women's day spa

318
00:17:28,274 --> 00:17:29,908
where there was an armed
robbery this morning.

319
00:17:29,974 --> 00:17:31,641
It was at your shop.

320
00:17:31,707 --> 00:17:33,841
You received stolen
property.

321
00:17:33,908 --> 00:17:35,574
I had no idea
they were stolen.

322
00:17:35,641 --> 00:17:36,741
What about these purses

323
00:17:36,807 --> 00:17:40,073
from the women
at the spa?

324
00:17:40,140 --> 00:17:42,040
What about 'em?
We found 'em

325
00:17:42,107 --> 00:17:43,707
in the dumpster
behind your store.

326
00:17:43,774 --> 00:17:44,941
Come on.

327
00:17:45,008 --> 00:17:47,407
Everyone at the shop
uses that trash can.

328
00:17:47,474 --> 00:17:48,874
Everybody else checks out.

329
00:17:48,941 --> 00:17:50,173
This is crazy.

330
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,741
I told you
I'm being messed with!

331
00:17:51,807 --> 00:17:54,941
You know, I feel exactly
the same way.

332
00:17:55,008 --> 00:17:56,340
Book him.

333
00:18:53,570 --> 00:18:54,837
Is that Victoria?

334
00:18:54,904 --> 00:18:55,871
Who are you?

335
00:18:55,937 --> 00:18:57,170
I'm her husband.

336
00:18:57,237 --> 00:19:01,038
Look, Mr. Morena,
you shouldn't be here.

337
00:19:01,104 --> 00:19:02,270
What are you
doing to her?

338
00:19:02,337 --> 00:19:04,170
I know that this
is upsetting, okay,

339
00:19:04,237 --> 00:19:06,071
but we have to process
your wife's body.

340
00:19:06,138 --> 00:19:07,570
Hasn't she been
through enough already?

341
00:19:07,637 --> 00:19:10,537
I want to catch the man
that did this to your wife

342
00:19:10,604 --> 00:19:11,904
and this is going to help.

343
00:19:15,470 --> 00:19:18,270
I was at the hospital with her.

344
00:19:18,337 --> 00:19:20,071
She was stable.

345
00:19:20,138 --> 00:19:23,138
I left Maria
for an hour.

346
00:19:23,203 --> 00:19:28,437
And when I returned, she...

347
00:19:30,904 --> 00:19:31,904
Look, I'm sorry.

348
00:19:31,971 --> 00:19:34,303
I should have been there.

349
00:19:34,370 --> 00:19:39,370
Please, just wait outside
in the lobby, okay?

350
00:19:39,437 --> 00:19:41,737
I promise
I'll take good care of her.

351
00:19:58,937 --> 00:20:00,303
The results on the trace
I pulled

352
00:20:00,370 --> 00:20:01,370
from the victim's hair.

353
00:20:01,437 --> 00:20:03,604
Just printed up.

354
00:20:03,671 --> 00:20:04,904
I don't mean
to criticize,

355
00:20:04,971 --> 00:20:08,303
but what took you
so long to collect it?

356
00:20:08,370 --> 00:20:09,937
You can't process
a victim's body

357
00:20:10,004 --> 00:20:11,370
until they're dead.

358
00:20:11,437 --> 00:20:12,470
Got it.

359
00:20:12,537 --> 00:20:16,570
So, I got C12,
H22 and O11.

360
00:20:16,637 --> 00:20:17,971
That's sucrose.

361
00:20:18,038 --> 00:20:20,570
Add dithiocarbamate
and you got a sugar mill.

362
00:20:20,637 --> 00:20:21,837
Yeah. Great.

363
00:20:21,904 --> 00:20:23,604
How many of those
are there in Miami?

364
00:20:23,671 --> 00:20:26,337
Only one with
a high concentration
of potassium carbamate.

365
00:20:26,404 --> 00:20:27,637
You lost me.

366
00:20:27,704 --> 00:20:29,570
It's the chemical
composition of wood ash.

367
00:20:31,470 --> 00:20:32,971
The fire at the Sullivan
sugar mill.

368
00:20:33,038 --> 00:20:34,370
Three weeks ago.

369
00:20:34,437 --> 00:20:37,537
That's enough time
to put in a chop shop.

370
00:21:02,138 --> 00:21:03,937
There's the Viper.

371
00:21:04,004 --> 00:21:05,704
Damn, they can do
a lot in a few hours.

372
00:21:05,771 --> 00:21:07,138
Surgical strip.

373
00:21:07,203 --> 00:21:09,604
I've seen cars completely pieced
out in under two hours.

374
00:21:18,470 --> 00:21:20,237
Here we go.

375
00:21:20,303 --> 00:21:23,004
MDPD! Down, everybody down!

376
00:21:23,071 --> 00:21:24,937
Hands on your head!

377
00:21:37,804 --> 00:21:39,203
Ryan!

378
00:21:49,004 --> 00:21:52,337
H, I-I don't know what happened.

379
00:21:52,404 --> 00:21:53,437
Mr. Wolfe, you didn't
have the shot.

380
00:21:53,504 --> 00:21:55,537
I-I just froze.

381
00:21:55,604 --> 00:21:58,337
Mr. Wolfe, you didn't have
the shot, you understand?

382
00:22:00,038 --> 00:22:01,704
I understand.

383
00:22:23,470 --> 00:22:26,537
You want to walk me through it?

384
00:22:26,604 --> 00:22:29,337
I staged at the door.

385
00:22:29,404 --> 00:22:32,971
Two suspects visible.

386
00:22:33,038 --> 00:22:36,138
I made entry.

387
00:22:36,203 --> 00:22:38,104
You ID yourselves?

388
00:22:38,170 --> 00:22:39,270
Yeah.

389
00:22:39,337 --> 00:22:41,237
Announced on entry.

390
00:22:41,303 --> 00:22:43,904
Badges were clearly in view.

391
00:22:43,971 --> 00:22:45,804
Go on.

392
00:22:48,737 --> 00:22:50,837
I approached one guy
to pat him down...

393
00:22:50,904 --> 00:22:53,604
next thing I know

394
00:22:53,671 --> 00:22:55,570
another guy come out
of nowhere with a gauge.

395
00:22:55,637 --> 00:22:57,138
Your weapon's drawn?

396
00:22:57,203 --> 00:22:59,904
Yeah.

397
00:22:59,971 --> 00:23:02,170
Well, you perceived a threat?

398
00:23:02,237 --> 00:23:03,904
Yeah.

399
00:23:03,971 --> 00:23:05,871
In Horatio's interview
he said that, uh,

400
00:23:05,937 --> 00:23:08,704
you didn't have a clear shot;
is that what happened?

401
00:23:11,004 --> 00:23:13,604
Ryan...

402
00:23:13,671 --> 00:23:15,404
is that what happened?

403
00:23:18,303 --> 00:23:21,203
Yeah, that's right.

404
00:23:26,337 --> 00:23:29,604
Pepper spray
has a UV marking dye.

405
00:23:29,671 --> 00:23:32,671
If this guy was near his buddy
when he got shot, we'll know it.

406
00:23:36,771 --> 00:23:38,203
There it is, H.

407
00:23:38,270 --> 00:23:39,871
So he was there.

408
00:23:39,937 --> 00:23:41,437
Come on, hurry up!

409
00:23:41,504 --> 00:23:43,237
Oh, God!

410
00:23:45,570 --> 00:23:46,704
Yeah.

411
00:23:46,771 --> 00:23:48,437
Now we got
two out of three,

412
00:23:48,504 --> 00:23:50,138
but he's not
our shooter.

413
00:23:50,203 --> 00:23:52,837
Witnesses said the shooter stood
about five feet from the others.

414
00:23:52,904 --> 00:23:55,071
 <i>If he was standing</i>
 <i>that far away,</i>

415
00:23:55,138 --> 00:23:57,038
 <i>he wouldn't get hit</i>
 <i>by pepper spray.</i>

416
00:24:01,038 --> 00:24:03,737
So we've got one more to go.

417
00:24:08,904 --> 00:24:11,904
Listen, we just went
through the purses

418
00:24:11,971 --> 00:24:13,303
from the dumpster.

419
00:24:13,370 --> 00:24:14,771
Credit cards are there,
but the IDs are missing.

420
00:24:14,837 --> 00:24:16,704
I know car thieves
don't change their MO,

421
00:24:16,771 --> 00:24:18,937
but they've got keys
and addresses.

422
00:24:19,004 --> 00:24:20,871
Eric, we are talking
about home invasion.

423
00:24:20,937 --> 00:24:22,004
Should I send cars?

424
00:24:22,071 --> 00:24:23,704
Send one to every house.
Done.

425
00:24:53,470 --> 00:24:54,504
Ma'am.

426
00:24:54,570 --> 00:24:56,704
Ma'am, it's okay.

427
00:24:56,771 --> 00:24:58,004
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
That man...

428
00:24:58,071 --> 00:24:59,937
It was the same man.

429
00:25:00,004 --> 00:25:02,270
The one from this
morning at the spa.

430
00:25:02,337 --> 00:25:04,604
Did you see his face?

431
00:25:04,671 --> 00:25:06,237
No.

432
00:25:06,303 --> 00:25:08,370
He had that mask.

433
00:25:08,437 --> 00:25:11,203
But it was him, his voice.

434
00:25:11,270 --> 00:25:14,237
The one who shot that girl.

435
00:25:14,303 --> 00:25:16,038
Okay, I want you
to try and relax.

436
00:25:16,104 --> 00:25:18,170
( <i>sobbing</i> ):
My friends...

437
00:25:18,237 --> 00:25:21,203
All my friends...
You have to do something.

438
00:25:21,270 --> 00:25:23,104
Everyone from the spa is safe.

439
00:25:23,170 --> 00:25:25,337
No, no, he took my Blackberry.

440
00:25:25,404 --> 00:25:28,170
He said all my rich friends
were gonna get it.

441
00:25:28,237 --> 00:25:30,270
TRIPP:
Horatio.

442
00:25:30,337 --> 00:25:32,337
Paramedics are here.

443
00:25:32,404 --> 00:25:34,203
What have you got?

444
00:25:34,270 --> 00:25:37,370
We, uh, we got patrol cars at
all the other ladies' homes,

445
00:25:37,437 --> 00:25:38,637
including Marisol's.

446
00:25:38,704 --> 00:25:39,937
It's not gonna be
enough, Frank.

447
00:25:40,004 --> 00:25:41,138
Why not?

448
00:25:41,203 --> 00:25:42,837
He's got her PDA
and all her contacts.

449
00:25:42,904 --> 00:25:44,404
That's too many to cover.

450
00:25:44,470 --> 00:25:46,170
No way we can protect everyone.

451
00:25:46,237 --> 00:25:47,671
That's exactly
what he's counting on.

452
00:26:11,937 --> 00:26:13,637
So I guess this eliminates
Carvell, right?

453
00:26:13,704 --> 00:26:16,004
'Cause he was in custody
when all this went down.

454
00:26:16,071 --> 00:26:19,404
So who the hell is this guy?

455
00:26:19,470 --> 00:26:23,570
I've never seen
a GTA escalate to houses.

456
00:26:23,637 --> 00:26:25,237
Whoever he is, he's desperate.

457
00:26:25,303 --> 00:26:27,337
That's the worst kind.

458
00:26:27,404 --> 00:26:29,737
Damn.

459
00:26:29,804 --> 00:26:31,671
No print?

460
00:26:31,737 --> 00:26:34,570
No, I've got ridge detail,
but nothing makeable.

461
00:26:34,637 --> 00:26:39,604
But ridge detail means
that he wasn't wearing gloves.

462
00:26:39,671 --> 00:26:41,737
That's right--
epithelials on the rope.

463
00:26:48,771 --> 00:26:50,437
That's good.

464
00:26:50,504 --> 00:26:53,170
We'll get it to DNA.

465
00:27:07,637 --> 00:27:09,203
Hey, you got any
results on that rope?

466
00:27:09,270 --> 00:27:10,337
Almost.

467
00:27:13,104 --> 00:27:14,937
Look, I'm sorry
about earlier, okay?

468
00:27:15,004 --> 00:27:16,537
I didn't mean to be rude.

469
00:27:16,604 --> 00:27:18,104
Whatever.

470
00:27:18,170 --> 00:27:20,138
You know what? I was just
really worried about Marisol.

471
00:27:20,203 --> 00:27:21,337
And not everything is something.

472
00:27:21,404 --> 00:27:23,437
No, I know that.
It's just that...

473
00:27:23,504 --> 00:27:25,837
Got a hit on the DNA
from the rope.

474
00:27:25,904 --> 00:27:27,470
Prior B&E.

475
00:27:27,537 --> 00:27:28,737
Javier Morena.

476
00:27:28,804 --> 00:27:32,004
Let me see that.

477
00:27:36,138 --> 00:27:39,737
Isn't that the spa
victim's last name?

478
00:27:39,804 --> 00:27:42,437
Yeah. It is.

479
00:27:50,537 --> 00:27:53,237
I can't believe
I felt sorry for you.

480
00:27:53,303 --> 00:27:55,771
For God's sake,
I didn't kill my wife.

481
00:27:55,837 --> 00:27:58,537
I must say,
it was a good cover-up.

482
00:27:58,604 --> 00:27:59,837
The whole robbery thing.

483
00:27:59,904 --> 00:28:01,437
Look, I wish you'd listen to me.

484
00:28:01,504 --> 00:28:02,837
I was never near that spa.

485
00:28:02,904 --> 00:28:04,804
What about
Cynthia Gilmore's house, huh?

486
00:28:04,871 --> 00:28:06,771
How you gonna lie
about that, Javier?

487
00:28:06,837 --> 00:28:09,303
We have your DNA.

488
00:28:13,303 --> 00:28:15,537
All right, I've been
to Cynthia's house.

489
00:28:15,604 --> 00:28:18,004
But I wasn't there to hurt her.

490
00:28:18,071 --> 00:28:20,203
What, tying her up
and scaring her to death,

491
00:28:20,270 --> 00:28:22,270
that was for what, for pleasure?

492
00:28:22,337 --> 00:28:25,637
Yeah, I tied her up.
But not this morning.

493
00:28:25,704 --> 00:28:29,203
And I swear it was consensual.

494
00:28:29,270 --> 00:28:32,004
So you're having an affair.

495
00:28:32,071 --> 00:28:34,004
You want proof, I got pictures.

496
00:28:34,071 --> 00:28:38,504
Well, hey, that's a perfect
motive for killing your wife.

497
00:28:38,570 --> 00:28:40,604
Look, I'm telling you.
I didn't kill Victoria.

498
00:28:42,138 --> 00:28:44,537
Come on, man.
Our sex life was, uh...

499
00:28:46,270 --> 00:28:47,737
But... but I loved her.

500
00:28:47,804 --> 00:28:49,837
Don't even. Don't even.

501
00:28:49,904 --> 00:28:52,537
I'm sorry.

502
00:28:52,604 --> 00:28:55,404
You should be.

503
00:28:55,470 --> 00:28:59,071
What's his story?

504
00:28:59,138 --> 00:29:01,671
He says he was S&M buddies
with Cynthia Gilmore.

505
00:29:01,737 --> 00:29:03,104
Victim of the home invasion?

506
00:29:03,170 --> 00:29:04,771
Well, it doesn't

507
00:29:04,837 --> 00:29:07,270
eliminate him
as a suspect in our shooting.

508
00:29:07,337 --> 00:29:09,704
Yeah, well, we need proof.

509
00:29:09,771 --> 00:29:12,504
Let's start by confirming
their relationship with Cynthia.

510
00:29:12,570 --> 00:29:14,104
We won't have to.

511
00:29:14,170 --> 00:29:15,504
He says he has pictures.

512
00:29:15,570 --> 00:29:17,104
Pictures.

513
00:29:20,771 --> 00:29:22,104
What are you thinking?

514
00:29:22,170 --> 00:29:24,270
I just got an idea.

515
00:29:29,138 --> 00:29:31,270
Is this everything?

516
00:29:31,337 --> 00:29:32,904
I guess Peeping Pete
travels light.

517
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:35,671
You want to tell me why I got
all this stuff out of booking?

518
00:29:35,737 --> 00:29:37,404
Voyeurs like to document,

519
00:29:37,470 --> 00:29:39,871
so I'm thinking he might have
pictures of the spa crime scene.

520
00:29:39,937 --> 00:29:41,704
Tripp says he checked this one.

521
00:29:41,771 --> 00:29:43,071
It's not
a camera phone.

522
00:29:46,004 --> 00:29:47,904
Wait a minute.

523
00:29:50,337 --> 00:29:51,904
This is a pretty big pen

524
00:29:51,971 --> 00:29:54,270
for a massage therapist
to carry around.

525
00:29:54,337 --> 00:29:55,971
Is there a hole
in the side of it?

526
00:29:59,771 --> 00:30:01,404
It has a lens.

527
00:30:18,370 --> 00:30:18,437
Not that I'm not
enjoying these,

528
00:30:20,504 --> 00:30:21,937
but this guy's gross.

529
00:30:22,004 --> 00:30:24,104
Well, maybe
he can help us.

530
00:30:24,170 --> 00:30:27,237
Whoa...

531
00:30:27,303 --> 00:30:28,937
our guy did
get some shots.

532
00:30:29,004 --> 00:30:31,671
The creep liked
skin and blood.

533
00:30:31,737 --> 00:30:33,337
Okay, there's the guy
with the gun.

534
00:30:33,404 --> 00:30:36,237
Let's compare him to the husband
of the dead girl.

535
00:30:36,303 --> 00:30:38,303
It's gonna be kind of hard
with the mask on.

536
00:30:42,138 --> 00:30:43,971
What about height?

537
00:30:44,038 --> 00:30:46,470
Yeah, I could do that if
we have a reference point.

538
00:30:46,537 --> 00:30:49,170
Okay, the thing
with the towel on it.

539
00:30:49,237 --> 00:30:52,337
Nice, okay.

540
00:30:52,404 --> 00:30:54,370
It's called a coat rack,
by the way.

541
00:30:54,437 --> 00:30:56,704
Standard one is 5?feet.

542
00:30:56,771 --> 00:30:59,637
So we just apply
that scale to our guy

543
00:30:59,704 --> 00:31:00,937
and calculate
the difference.

544
00:31:01,004 --> 00:31:04,038
No, five-foot-ten.

545
00:31:04,104 --> 00:31:06,637
Morena's over six feet.
That excludes him.

546
00:31:06,704 --> 00:31:07,704
Oh, hang on.

547
00:31:07,771 --> 00:31:09,004
See something
that could help,

548
00:31:09,071 --> 00:31:10,871
at least when
you do find the guy.

549
00:31:10,937 --> 00:31:12,504
Guy's got a tattoo
on his wrist,

550
00:31:12,570 --> 00:31:13,771
the hand holding
the gun.

551
00:31:13,837 --> 00:31:15,270
Okay, print that out.

552
00:31:15,337 --> 00:31:17,038
I'll give it to everyone.
Good eye.

553
00:31:17,104 --> 00:31:19,904
Speaking of, what happened
at the chop shop, dude?

554
00:31:19,971 --> 00:31:22,203
Heard you pulled
a Statue of Liberty.

555
00:31:22,270 --> 00:31:25,004
Who told you that?

556
00:31:25,071 --> 00:31:27,437
No, just thinking
it was funny,

557
00:31:27,504 --> 00:31:30,104
'cause you told me
to hang back at the dock.

558
00:31:30,170 --> 00:31:32,671
I told you, you didn't
have a weapon.

559
00:31:32,737 --> 00:31:34,871
And I would have used one
if I had one.

560
00:31:38,270 --> 00:31:40,637
You go out on one damn case,
you think you're Serpico?

561
00:31:40,704 --> 00:31:42,237
Wolfe, I...

562
00:31:42,303 --> 00:31:46,337
I didn't have a clean shot.
Okay? That's it.

563
00:31:58,237 --> 00:31:59,871
Eric, what's going on?

564
00:31:59,937 --> 00:32:00,871
Where's Marisol?

565
00:32:00,937 --> 00:32:02,504
She's at
the hospital.

566
00:32:02,570 --> 00:32:04,071
You're sure?
She's not answering

567
00:32:04,138 --> 00:32:05,437
her cell phone and the alarm
just went off at her house.

568
00:32:05,504 --> 00:32:07,237
Let's go.

569
00:32:48,437 --> 00:32:50,671
Eric, check his pulse.

570
00:32:57,837 --> 00:32:59,604
He's dead.

571
00:33:03,170 --> 00:33:04,771
That tattoo.

572
00:33:04,837 --> 00:33:08,937
It matches the one Ryan and
Cooper found on Pete's pictures.

573
00:33:09,004 --> 00:33:11,004
This is the guy
that shot Victoria.

574
00:33:11,071 --> 00:33:12,937
Put a gun in my sister's face.

575
00:33:18,370 --> 00:33:19,837
You son of a bitch.

576
00:33:19,904 --> 00:33:20,904
You know him?

577
00:33:20,971 --> 00:33:22,904
His name's Greg Everest.

578
00:33:22,971 --> 00:33:26,504
Questioned him
when we picked up Carvell.

579
00:33:26,570 --> 00:33:29,270
Worked at the shop.
Came up clean.

580
00:33:29,337 --> 00:33:33,004
Yeah, so the question is, Eric,
who killed him?

581
00:33:41,980 --> 00:33:43,280
??

582
00:33:43,280 --> 00:33:46,280
??

583
00:33:46,280 --> 00:33:52,280
???

584
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:55,780
??

585
00:33:58,677 --> 00:34:00,710
What do I do?

586
00:34:00,777 --> 00:34:04,044
I want you to stay at my place
till this is over.

587
00:34:04,111 --> 00:34:05,544
They won't look
for you there.

588
00:34:05,610 --> 00:34:07,744
You've done so much for me.
You don't have to...

589
00:34:07,811 --> 00:34:10,343
I think it would be
a good idea.

590
00:34:11,377 --> 00:34:12,710
Are you sure?

591
00:34:12,777 --> 00:34:14,178
Mm-hmm.

592
00:34:14,244 --> 00:34:15,677
I am.

593
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:18,211
I'm going to have the officer
take you over there right now.

594
00:34:18,278 --> 00:34:19,944
Officer.

595
00:34:20,011 --> 00:34:22,377
Go ahead.

596
00:34:38,911 --> 00:34:41,343
I can't believe
I let this guy go

597
00:34:41,410 --> 00:34:43,343
at the car place.

598
00:34:43,410 --> 00:34:44,877
Don't beat yourself up,
Calleigh.

599
00:34:44,944 --> 00:34:46,710
The boy looks
like Charlie Brown.

600
00:34:46,777 --> 00:34:48,044
It doesn't matter.

601
00:34:48,111 --> 00:34:49,911
We're taught not to
pay attention to type.

602
00:34:49,977 --> 00:34:52,410
You're also taught
to follow the evidence.

603
00:34:52,477 --> 00:34:54,011
But he had a tattoo.

604
00:34:54,077 --> 00:34:55,278
If I had looked
more closely, I
would've seen it.

605
00:34:55,343 --> 00:34:57,510
It would've been
out of context if you had.

606
00:34:57,577 --> 00:34:59,777
I hope you're right.

607
00:34:59,844 --> 00:35:01,811
Of course I am, honey.

608
00:35:06,677 --> 00:35:07,877
It's a .38.

609
00:35:07,944 --> 00:35:10,744
Same type pulled
from Victoria Morena.

610
00:35:10,811 --> 00:35:13,310
Yeah. I'd have to confirm it,

611
00:35:13,377 --> 00:35:15,811
but I'd say it's possible
he was shot with his own gun.

612
00:35:21,244 --> 00:35:23,144
Well, makes sense.

613
00:35:23,211 --> 00:35:25,777
There are definite signs
of struggle on the body.

614
00:35:25,844 --> 00:35:26,977
Really?
Yeah.

615
00:35:27,044 --> 00:35:28,610
Besides the laceration,

616
00:35:28,677 --> 00:35:30,644
he's got at least one
broken rib

617
00:35:30,710 --> 00:35:32,477
and a nasty contusion.

618
00:35:32,544 --> 00:35:34,044
That's a weird pattern.

619
00:35:34,111 --> 00:35:36,343
Do you think somebody hit him
with something?

620
00:35:36,410 --> 00:35:37,844
Or grabbed him.

621
00:35:40,844 --> 00:35:42,811
That would mean that there
would've had to have been

622
00:35:42,877 --> 00:35:45,844
something between their
hand and his skin.

623
00:35:45,911 --> 00:35:47,410
Well, I can tell you

624
00:35:47,477 --> 00:35:50,310
Greg wasn't wearing long sleeves
when I got to him.

625
00:35:50,377 --> 00:35:52,278
Maybe our killer
was wearing gloves.

626
00:35:53,343 --> 00:35:56,278
Would be enough
to leave a pattern.

627
00:36:10,911 --> 00:36:13,144
So, what did
you and Alexx come up with?

628
00:36:13,211 --> 00:36:14,777
There's a
patterned bruise

629
00:36:14,844 --> 00:36:16,477
on Greg Everest's arm.

630
00:36:16,544 --> 00:36:20,310
So what, you think, uh,
his killer was wearing gloves?

631
00:36:20,377 --> 00:36:22,544
I'm comparing every
pair I could find.

632
00:36:25,710 --> 00:36:28,644
These are close, but they'd
have to have stitching

633
00:36:28,710 --> 00:36:31,377
across the fingers
to make this line.

634
00:36:33,011 --> 00:36:34,977
Maybe stitching
didn't cause it.

635
00:36:35,044 --> 00:36:36,644
Maybe our killer
wore gloves

636
00:36:36,710 --> 00:36:37,977
that stop halfway
up the fingers.

637
00:36:38,044 --> 00:36:39,544
Like weight-
lifting gloves?

638
00:36:39,610 --> 00:36:40,944
Like driving gloves.

639
00:36:41,011 --> 00:36:43,410
Hey, bring up the gloves
I got off Hayden.

640
00:36:52,944 --> 00:36:55,443
He's our man.

641
00:36:56,477 --> 00:36:58,844
I'll tell H.

642
00:37:03,777 --> 00:37:06,111
Greg Everest sold you
a stolen car,

643
00:37:06,178 --> 00:37:07,677
and you wanted him dead.

644
00:37:07,744 --> 00:37:09,877
Look...

645
00:37:09,944 --> 00:37:13,077
I studied business law
at Harvard for two years.

646
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:15,644
The judge is never going
to hold me on this.

647
00:37:15,710 --> 00:37:18,077
Hayden, this is a criminal case.

648
00:37:18,144 --> 00:37:20,211
( <i>laughs</i> ):
It's not going to matter.

649
00:37:20,278 --> 00:37:21,544
Oh, yes, it will.

650
00:37:21,610 --> 00:37:23,777
Do you know who my father is?

651
00:37:23,844 --> 00:37:25,310
I hope he's a lawyer.

652
00:37:25,377 --> 00:37:26,777
You're going to need one.

653
00:37:26,844 --> 00:37:28,644
This is ridiculous.

654
00:37:28,710 --> 00:37:30,178
I don't even own a gun.

655
00:37:30,244 --> 00:37:32,577
And that's why you used Greg's.

656
00:37:32,644 --> 00:37:34,310
Your own people said
they didn't find

657
00:37:34,377 --> 00:37:37,044
any of that gun residue
stuff on my hands.

658
00:37:37,111 --> 00:37:39,544
That's because you were wearing
driving gloves.

659
00:37:41,377 --> 00:37:42,377
Prove it.

660
00:37:43,410 --> 00:37:44,944
I'm going to.

661
00:37:45,011 --> 00:37:47,677
We confiscated
this glove

662
00:37:47,744 --> 00:37:50,278
when you got pulled over
in the Lamborghini.

663
00:37:50,343 --> 00:37:53,510
Your glove matches
that bruise on Greg.

664
00:37:54,544 --> 00:37:56,944
Okay.

665
00:37:57,011 --> 00:37:58,610
I went to the
guy's work.

666
00:37:58,677 --> 00:37:59,710
I watched him leave.

667
00:37:59,777 --> 00:38:00,777
I followed him
to some house,

668
00:38:00,844 --> 00:38:03,111
and we had an argument.

669
00:38:03,178 --> 00:38:04,278
That car was hot.

670
00:38:04,343 --> 00:38:05,443
Like you didn't know.

671
00:38:05,510 --> 00:38:06,310
I want my money.

672
00:38:06,377 --> 00:38:07,477
I don't have it.

673
00:38:07,544 --> 00:38:08,844
Now get the hell out of here!

674
00:38:09,777 --> 00:38:11,310
It was just
an argument.

675
00:38:11,377 --> 00:38:12,977
I didn't kill anybody.

676
00:38:13,044 --> 00:38:15,111
Drop the act, Hayden, okay?

677
00:38:15,178 --> 00:38:17,111
Based on your education,

678
00:38:17,178 --> 00:38:19,710
you should know we have enough
for a conviction.

679
00:38:20,744 --> 00:38:23,343
( <i>sighs</i> )

680
00:38:24,844 --> 00:38:26,777
He took off with 100
grand of my money.

681
00:38:26,844 --> 00:38:28,443
Wouldn't you try
to get it back?

682
00:38:28,510 --> 00:38:31,144
I suppose I would, but I don't
think I'd kill him over it.

683
00:38:31,211 --> 00:38:32,144
I want my money.

684
00:38:32,211 --> 00:38:33,544
Give it to me.

685
00:38:33,610 --> 00:38:35,710
Listen, you rich little brat,
I'll give you something.

686
00:38:37,144 --> 00:38:38,977
( <i>gunshot</i> )

687
00:38:39,044 --> 00:38:40,644
I couldn't let him
get away with that.

688
00:38:40,710 --> 00:38:42,977
Street punk like that
pulling a gun on someone

689
00:38:43,044 --> 00:38:44,977
with my background?

690
00:38:45,044 --> 00:38:49,911
Well, now, Hayden, you can add
"killer" to your resume.

691
00:38:54,644 --> 00:38:58,777
Hey, we got our guy.
Good job with the Viper.

692
00:39:02,977 --> 00:39:05,644
Thanks.

693
00:39:05,710 --> 00:39:09,077
You, uh... you headed out?

694
00:39:09,144 --> 00:39:10,144
Yeah.

695
00:39:14,944 --> 00:39:18,777
Hey, Ryan, I promise I'm only
going to ask you this once,

696
00:39:18,844 --> 00:39:20,944
but the... shooting...

697
00:39:21,011 --> 00:39:23,211
had nothing to do
with your eye, did it?

698
00:39:26,343 --> 00:39:28,677
I wish it did.

699
00:39:32,044 --> 00:39:35,144
You know, when I first stared
patrol, I was on nights,

700
00:39:35,211 --> 00:39:37,211
and then they moved me
to days,

701
00:39:37,278 --> 00:39:40,510
and after about a year,
they put me back on nights.

702
00:39:40,577 --> 00:39:42,877
I don't follow.

703
00:39:42,944 --> 00:39:45,977
Well, in all my time on days,
I had lost my night eyes.

704
00:39:46,044 --> 00:39:48,410
And I never said anything
to anyone about it

705
00:39:48,477 --> 00:39:49,977
'cause I was scared.

706
00:39:50,044 --> 00:39:51,044
I couldn't see.

707
00:39:52,377 --> 00:39:55,911
You know it was broad daylight
this afternoon.

708
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:03,911
What I'm saying
is that sometimes...

709
00:40:03,977 --> 00:40:06,710
change can throw you off.

710
00:40:06,777 --> 00:40:09,144
You were on patrol.
You went into the lab.

711
00:40:09,211 --> 00:40:11,744
It's easy to forget
how to be in the field.

712
00:40:11,811 --> 00:40:14,244
Did you ever freeze?

713
00:40:14,310 --> 00:40:16,343
Not yet...

714
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:19,644
but it could happen
to any of us at any time.

715
00:40:27,077 --> 00:40:28,544
Thank you.

716
00:40:30,144 --> 00:40:33,111
You'd do the same thing for me
if I were having a bad day.

717
00:40:37,077 --> 00:40:39,443
See you later.

718
00:40:48,111 --> 00:40:50,710
Marisol, you okay?

719
00:40:50,777 --> 00:40:52,877
Why aren't you at home?

720
00:40:54,278 --> 00:40:57,377
What's going on?

721
00:40:59,211 --> 00:41:01,310
You know, it's funny.

722
00:41:01,377 --> 00:41:06,310
I... I've been fighting
this... stupid cancer,

723
00:41:06,377 --> 00:41:08,644
and... I don't know.

724
00:41:08,710 --> 00:41:11,211
I guess I never really thought
about things.

725
00:41:12,211 --> 00:41:15,144
Like what things?

726
00:41:15,211 --> 00:41:17,677
Like what I'd be missing.

727
00:41:17,744 --> 00:41:19,677
You know, this morning...

728
00:41:19,744 --> 00:41:25,410
that woman, she was shot
right in front of me.

729
00:41:27,077 --> 00:41:29,011
I don't know.
Sometimes I think...

730
00:41:29,077 --> 00:41:33,510
I've been trying so hard
not to die

731
00:41:33,577 --> 00:41:37,178
that I forget to live.

732
00:41:38,343 --> 00:41:40,343
There's so much
that I-I've never done.

733
00:41:40,410 --> 00:41:42,510
You know,
I've never traveled--

734
00:41:42,577 --> 00:41:45,644
really traveled.

735
00:41:45,710 --> 00:41:48,577
You can do
those things now.

736
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:57,278
I've never had a baby.

737
00:42:00,211 --> 00:42:02,044
It's not too late.

738
00:42:06,610 --> 00:42:09,577
What did you say?

739
00:42:09,644 --> 00:42:13,044
I said it's not too late.

740
00:42:14,077 --> 00:42:16,144
When you say that...

741
00:42:16,211 --> 00:42:17,710
I believe you.

742
00:42:17,777 --> 00:42:20,443
That's because it's true.
