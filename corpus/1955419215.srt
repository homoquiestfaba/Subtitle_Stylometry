JAMES PRESTON
DENVER, COLORADO
RATE 2 MECHANICAL ENGINEER

17
00:04:24,443 --> 00:04:26,294
Good Morning, James!

18
00:04:26,319 --> 00:04:27,898
How're you feeling?

19
00:04:27,923 --> 00:04:29,232
Wait, what?

20
00:04:29,257 --> 00:04:31,981
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

21
00:04:32,006 --> 00:04:35,809
You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

22
00:04:36,450 --> 00:04:37,531
What?

23
00:04:37,556 --> 00:04:39,468
It's okay, James.

24
00:04:39,493 --> 00:04:40,604
It's Jim.

25
00:04:40,629 --> 00:04:42,014
Jim.

26
00:04:42,431 --> 00:04:44,085
Just breathe.

27
00:04:44,110 --> 00:04:45,602
Everything is okay.

28
00:04:45,627 --> 00:04:46,757
Where am I?

29
00:04:46,782 --> 00:04:48,960
You're a passenger on the Starship Avalon.

30
00:04:48,985 --> 00:04:52,774
The Homestead Company's
premier interstellar star liner.

31
00:04:53,825 --> 00:04:57,743
We've nearly completed the voyage
from Earth to your new home,

32
00:04:57,768 --> 00:05:00,662
the colony world of Homestead II.

33
00:05:00,947 --> 00:05:02,186
A new world.

34
00:05:02,211 --> 00:05:03,695
A fresh start.

35
00:05:03,720 --> 00:05:05,525
Room to grow.

36
00:05:05,550 --> 00:05:06,897
Oh, yeah.

37
00:05:06,922 --> 00:05:09,055
The Avalon is on final approach.

38
00:05:09,080 --> 00:05:11,420
For the next 4 months,
you'll enjoy space travel

39
00:05:11,445 --> 00:05:13,692
at it's most luxurious.

40
00:05:13,717 --> 00:05:16,384
Food. Fun.
Friends.

41
00:05:16,409 --> 00:05:17,578
My friends.

42
00:05:17,603 --> 00:05:19,092
That's right, Jim.

43
00:05:19,117 --> 00:05:23,371
The I.D. band on your wrist is your key
to the wonders of the Avalon.

44
00:05:24,746 --> 00:05:26,659
You're in perfect health, Jim.

45
00:05:26,684 --> 00:05:29,828
Let's get you to your cabin
where you can get some rest.

46
00:05:37,049 --> 00:05:41,123
You maybe experiencing post-hibernation sickness.

47
00:05:42,259 --> 00:05:44,752
Your door will be lite up for you.

48
00:05:47,815 --> 00:05:49,245
Welcome to your cabin.

49
00:05:49,270 --> 00:05:51,630
Your home until we make landfall.

50
00:05:51,655 --> 00:05:56,042
Over the next 4 months, you'll prepare
for your new life on Homestead II.

51
00:05:56,067 --> 00:05:59,159
Meet you fellow passengers,
take skill building classes

52
00:05:59,184 --> 00:06:01,559
and learn about colonial living.

53
00:06:01,767 --> 00:06:04,179
You've been assigned to Learning group 38,

54
00:06:04,204 --> 00:06:07,552
for passengers with engineering
and technical trade skills.

55
00:06:07,577 --> 00:06:10,652
Please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

56
00:06:11,548 --> 00:06:16,140
Jim, please scan your I.D.
to confirm luggage delivery.

57
00:06:20,391 --> 00:06:25,138
To help you recover from hibernation,
be sure to drink plenty of fluids

58
00:06:26,533 --> 00:06:29,260
Enjoy the rest of your voyage
on the Avalon,

59
00:06:29,285 --> 00:06:32,105
a Homestead Company Starship

60
00:06:34,009 --> 00:06:35,345
Good morning one and all.

61
00:06:35,370 --> 00:06:38,170
It's a beautiful morning
here on the Starship Avalon.

62
00:06:38,195 --> 00:06:40,935
Whatever you do don't get homesick,
get Homestead.

63
00:06:40,960 --> 00:06:44,141
Let start with an ensemble,
one of my favorite back on Earth.

64
00:06:59,960 --> 00:07:03,430
Just call me... call me Jim.
You got a cool jacket.

65
00:07:17,373 --> 00:07:19,435
Hello, Passengers.

66
00:07:19,685 --> 00:07:22,369
Will you all
please take a seat.

67
00:07:23,063 --> 00:07:25,659
Welcome, Learning group 38.

68
00:07:25,684 --> 00:07:29,006
Your introduction to colonial life.

69
00:07:29,131 --> 00:07:31,170
Earth is a prosperous planet.

70
00:07:31,195 --> 00:07:33,346
The cradle of civilization.

71
00:07:33,371 --> 00:07:38,913
But for many, it's also overpopulated.
Over-priced. Overrated.

72
00:07:38,938 --> 00:07:41,534
I'm sorry,
I think I maybe in the wrong...

73
00:07:41,563 --> 00:07:43,379
- No questions until the end, please.
- Oh, sorry.

74
00:07:43,404 --> 00:07:45,996
The Colonies offer an alternative.

75
00:07:46,021 --> 00:07:47,787
- A better way of life.
- Where are all the other...

76
00:07:47,819 --> 00:07:52,210
And there's no colony
more beautiful than Homestead II,

77
00:07:52,235 --> 00:07:55,660
- the Jewel of the Occupied Worlds.
- It's fine.

78
00:07:55,842 --> 00:07:57,446
Where IS everybody?

79
00:07:57,471 --> 00:07:59,559
We're all on the Starship Avalon.

80
00:07:59,584 --> 00:08:00,938
But I'm the only one here.

81
00:08:00,963 --> 00:08:05,619
There are 5,000 passengers
and 258 crew members.

82
00:08:05,644 --> 00:08:07,389
So why am I alone?

83
00:08:07,414 --> 00:08:09,845
We're all in this together.

84
00:08:11,605 --> 00:08:13,219
Hello?

85
00:08:14,399 --> 00:08:16,146
Anybody here?

86
00:08:16,171 --> 00:08:17,659
Hello?

87
00:08:28,535 --> 00:08:31,593
Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

88
00:08:31,618 --> 00:08:35,799
This elevator will experience
a momentary lapse in gravity.

89
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,417
Grand Concourse.

90
00:09:15,077 --> 00:09:19,015
Welcome to the Grand Concourse
aboard the Avalon, can I help you?

91
00:09:19,468 --> 00:09:21,544
I need to talk to a person.

92
00:09:21,690 --> 00:09:23,150
A real live person, please.

93
00:09:23,175 --> 00:09:26,182
What sort of person? Personal trainer?
Travel planner? Therapist?

94
00:09:26,207 --> 00:09:28,601
I don't know.
Somebody in charge.

95
00:09:28,626 --> 00:09:32,772
The Ship Steward handles passenger affairs.
It's on level 3 of the Grand Concourse.

96
00:09:32,797 --> 00:09:34,877
- Thank you.
- Happy to help!

97
00:09:40,281 --> 00:09:41,546
Not good.

98
00:09:41,571 --> 00:09:43,077
- Hello!
- Who's flying the ship?

99
00:09:43,102 --> 00:09:45,546
The flight crew, the Captain,
the Pilot, the Chief Navigator...

100
00:09:45,571 --> 00:09:47,096
I want to talk to the Captain.

101
00:09:47,121 --> 00:09:48,883
The Captain rarely handles
passenger queries directly.

102
00:09:48,908 --> 00:09:51,595
It's an emergency, please.

103
00:09:51,620 --> 00:09:55,044
The Captain is usually found on the
Bridge, in the Command Deck.

104
00:10:05,186 --> 00:10:08,672
Bridge access requires special authorization.

105
00:10:10,324 --> 00:10:14,108
Bridge access requires special authorization.

106
00:10:16,110 --> 00:10:18,160
You got to be kidding me.

107
00:10:31,736 --> 00:10:34,320
Welcome to the Observatory.

108
00:10:35,820 --> 00:10:37,835
What can I show you?

109
00:10:38,537 --> 00:10:40,883
We're supposed to land soon,

110
00:10:43,530 --> 00:10:46,405
I'm... I'm the only one awake.

111
00:10:46,430 --> 00:10:50,037
I don't understand.
What can I show you?

112
00:10:50,650 --> 00:10:51,991
Show me Homestead II.

113
00:10:52,016 --> 00:10:55,398
Homestead II is the 4th planet
in the Bhakti system.

114
00:10:55,423 --> 00:10:57,565
Right.
And where are we?

115
00:10:57,591 --> 00:11:00,757
We've been transit
from Earth to Homestead II.

116
00:11:00,795 --> 00:11:04,262
- We will arrive in approximately 90 years.
- What?

117
00:11:04,287 --> 00:11:08,599
We arrive at Homestead II
in 90 years, 3 weeks and 1 day.

118
00:11:08,624 --> 00:11:11,082
No.
Wait. How long ago did we leave Earth?

119
00:11:11,107 --> 00:11:14,294
Approximately 30 years ago.

120
00:11:17,695 --> 00:11:19,717
I woke up too soon.

121
00:11:22,260 --> 00:11:23,420
Hello.

122
00:11:23,445 --> 00:11:24,984
How do I send a
message to Earth?

123
00:11:25,009 --> 00:11:29,305
Interstellar messages are sent by laser array.
This is an expensive service.

124
00:11:29,330 --> 00:11:31,633
- Bite me.
- Happy to help!

125
00:11:33,825 --> 00:11:35,152
Planet and connection?

126
00:11:35,177 --> 00:11:37,175
Earth.
The HomeStead Company.

127
00:11:37,200 --> 00:11:42,196
There are 30,826 contacts
listed under “HomeStead Company.”

128
00:11:42,221 --> 00:11:45,204
I'm emigrating to Homestead II.
I have an emergency.

129
00:11:45,229 --> 00:11:48,074
- I have a Customer Help Line.
- Sounds about right.

130
00:11:48,099 --> 00:11:49,801
Begin message.

131
00:11:50,262 --> 00:11:53,199
Hi.
I'm Jim Preston.

132
00:11:53,665 --> 00:11:55,742
I'm a passenger on the Avalon.

133
00:11:56,090 --> 00:11:57,532
And uh...

134
00:12:00,483 --> 00:12:03,217
I think something went wrong
with my hibernation pod.

135
00:12:03,242 --> 00:12:04,903
I woke up too soon.

136
00:12:04,928 --> 00:12:08,597
And I mean...
way too soon.

137
00:12:08,622 --> 00:12:11,458
Nobody else is awake.
And...

138
00:12:11,739 --> 00:12:13,595
I don't know how
to get back to sleep.

139
00:12:13,620 --> 00:12:17,011
And the thing is,
there's 90 years to go.

140
00:12:20,171 --> 00:12:22,713
At this rate, I'm...

141
00:12:26,248 --> 00:12:28,708
I'm sorry, I'm trying to fix this.
I...

142
00:12:28,733 --> 00:12:31,560
Maybe I missed something.
I could use a hand.

143
00:12:32,355 --> 00:12:33,945
That's all.

144
00:12:34,829 --> 00:12:36,341
Thank you.

145
00:12:37,065 --> 00:12:38,920
Message sent.

146
00:12:40,786 --> 00:12:41,747
Outstanding.

147
00:12:41,772 --> 00:12:45,265
- Message will arrive in 19 years.
- Wait, what?

148
00:12:45,290 --> 00:12:49,941
- Earliest reply in 55 years.
- 55 years.

149
00:12:50,302 --> 00:12:52,500
We apologize for the delay.

150
00:12:52,525 --> 00:12:55,406
That will be $6012 dollars.

151
00:13:09,093 --> 00:13:11,006
- Afternoon.
- Oh man.

152
00:13:11,031 --> 00:13:13,369
It's good to see another face.

153
00:13:13,394 --> 00:13:14,959
I thought I was
the only one awake!

154
00:13:14,984 --> 00:13:18,212
Who want's to sleep
on a beautiful day like this?

155
00:13:18,237 --> 00:13:21,407
Oh, I mean we're in trouble,
we're not suppose to be here.

156
00:13:21,432 --> 00:13:23,467
Well, I won't tell if you don't.

157
00:13:23,804 --> 00:13:26,135
- Huh?
- Our little secret.

158
00:13:27,571 --> 00:13:29,516
What can I get for you?

159
00:13:29,548 --> 00:13:32,611
- What?
- You look like a whiskey man.

160
00:13:32,636 --> 00:13:33,995
Okay.

161
00:13:37,785 --> 00:13:40,255
Oh, you're a robot.

162
00:13:41,071 --> 00:13:43,933
Android, technically.

163
00:13:45,549 --> 00:13:47,381
 Arthur's the name.

164
00:13:47,675 --> 00:13:50,127
- Jim.
- Please to meet you, Jim.

165
00:13:56,090 --> 00:13:58,494
How much do you know
about this ship?

166
00:13:58,519 --> 00:14:00,980
I don't know.
I know some things.

167
00:14:01,005 --> 00:14:03,332
What do I do if
my hibernation pod malfunctions?

168
00:14:03,357 --> 00:14:05,957
Oh.
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

169
00:14:05,982 --> 00:14:08,991
- They never malfunction.
- Yeah, well, I woke up early.

170
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:10,762
Can't happen.

171
00:14:10,787 --> 00:14:12,788
How long until we get to Homestead II?

172
00:14:12,813 --> 00:14:14,550
About 90 years or so.

173
00:14:14,575 --> 00:14:16,749
And when are all the passengers
supposed to wake up?

174
00:14:16,774 --> 00:14:19,111
Not until the last 4 months.

175
00:14:19,565 --> 00:14:24,569
How is it that I'm sitting here with you
with 90 years to go?

176
00:14:28,366 --> 00:14:30,713
It's not possible for you to be here.

177
00:14:32,846 --> 00:14:34,452
But I am.

178
00:14:39,019 --> 00:14:41,781
Good morning, it's a beautiful day
here on the Avalon.

179
00:14:41,806 --> 00:14:45,904
So wake up, sunshine.
It's time to relax and enjoy your stay.

180
00:14:56,061 --> 00:14:58,329
Please make a selection.

181
00:14:59,652 --> 00:15:03,962
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

182
00:15:03,987 --> 00:15:06,754
Sorry. The Mocha Cappuccino Extreme
is reserved for gold-class passengers.

183
00:15:06,779 --> 00:15:09,065
I want the Mocha Cappuccino Extreme,
bill my room please.

184
00:15:09,090 --> 00:15:10,945
Food can be purchase in the ship's...

185
00:15:10,970 --> 00:15:12,369
Sorry.
The French Roast...

186
00:15:12,394 --> 00:15:14,343
Sorry.
The Pumpkin Spice...

187
00:15:14,368 --> 00:15:15,546
Sorry.
Vanilla Chai...

188
00:15:15,571 --> 00:15:16,874
Sorry.
Sorry.

189
00:15:16,899 --> 00:15:18,724
Sorr... Sorr... Sorry.

190
00:15:19,190 --> 00:15:22,380
- Large coffee. Please enjoy your coffee.
- Cream. Sugar.

191
00:15:22,405 --> 00:15:24,137
Oh, really?

199
00:17:40,340 --> 00:17:44,052
I'm screwed, Arthur.
Completely and ridiculously screwed.

200
00:17:44,077 --> 00:17:48,470
Come on, now.
Every cloud has a silver lining.

201
00:17:49,700 --> 00:17:52,769
Guess, I'm going to die
of old age on this ship!

202
00:17:52,794 --> 00:17:54,657
Oh, we all die.

203
00:17:54,682 --> 00:17:57,385
Even androids end up
on the scrap heap.

204
00:17:57,783 --> 00:18:01,003
I'm the only customer,
why are you always polishing a glass?

205
00:18:01,265 --> 00:18:02,817
Trick of the trade.

206
00:18:02,842 --> 00:18:05,622
Makes people nervous when
a bartender just stands there.

207
00:18:05,647 --> 00:18:09,613
So, lay some bartender wisdom on me.
I'm lost in space here.

208
00:18:11,240 --> 00:18:13,940
You're not where you want to be.

209
00:18:13,965 --> 00:18:17,394
You feel like you're supposed
to be somewhere else.

210
00:18:20,844 --> 00:18:22,371
- You said it.
- Well.

211
00:18:22,396 --> 00:18:26,323
Say you could snap your fingers and
be wherever you wanted to be.

212
00:18:26,348 --> 00:18:30,037
I'll bet you'd still feel this way.
Not in the right place.

213
00:18:30,062 --> 00:18:33,843
The point is, you can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

214
00:18:33,868 --> 00:18:36,610
that you forget how to make
the most of where you are.

215
00:18:36,635 --> 00:18:38,233
What are you telling me?

216
00:18:38,258 --> 00:18:42,189
Take a break from worrying
about what you can't control.

217
00:18:43,402 --> 00:18:45,041
Live a little.

218
00:18:45,204 --> 00:18:46,968
Live a little.

219
00:18:56,034 --> 00:18:59,255
Welcome to the BM suite.

220
00:18:59,837 --> 00:19:01,416
Oh yeah.

221
00:19:06,374 --> 00:19:07,934
What?

222
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:19,985
Make that a double jumbo shrimp.
Triple.

223
00:19:20,010 --> 00:19:22,253
Thank you very much.

224
00:19:22,663 --> 00:19:23,960
Phantom.

225
00:19:26,018 --> 00:19:27,406
Alright.

226
00:19:29,165 --> 00:19:31,376
I did exactly what you did.

227
00:19:36,294 --> 00:19:38,034
Large coffee.

228
00:19:42,038 --> 00:19:44,115
A margarita, please.

229
00:19:44,140 --> 00:19:46,060
You have Han many, Señor.

230
00:19:46,085 --> 00:19:49,504
Oh Hector, please.
Another one.

231
00:19:49,529 --> 00:19:51,121
Yes, Señor.

232
00:19:51,323 --> 00:19:52,918
Thank you.

233
00:20:04,401 --> 00:20:06,679
Get out of here!

234
00:20:07,851 --> 00:20:09,645
Come back.
Hey.

235
00:20:11,808 --> 00:20:13,289
Come here.

236
00:20:44,263 --> 00:20:45,876
Damn!

237
00:21:08,574 --> 00:21:10,412
Welcome, Jim.

238
00:21:11,583 --> 00:21:16,079
Please turn your attention to the
screen displaying safety tips.

239
00:21:16,104 --> 00:21:20,304
These space suits are designed to withstand
the harsh environment of space.

240
00:21:20,337 --> 00:21:23,780
The carbon fiber and body armor...

241
00:21:50,673 --> 00:21:54,559
Slide the handle on the right
to release the air pressure.

242
00:21:56,057 --> 00:21:58,109
Magnetic boots now engage.

243
00:21:58,134 --> 00:22:01,559

control panel on your arm.

244
00:22:01,584 --> 00:22:04,872
Press the red button
to open the air lock door.

245
00:22:08,040 --> 00:22:10,157
Have a wonderful time.

00:22:17,449 --> 00:22:19,400

We hope you decide to join us again soon
for another thrilling experience.

250
00:24:20,326 --> 00:24:22,702

252
00:25:42,878 --> 00:25:44,947
Aurora.

253
00:25:46,015 --> 00:25:48,530
Searching passenger profiles.

254
00:25:48,555 --> 00:25:50,318
I'm Aurora Lane.

255
00:25:50,343 --> 00:25:53,642
Passenger 1456.
I'm a writer.

256
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,723
I think we tell each other stories
to know we're not alone.

257
00:25:56,748 --> 00:25:58,058
 To make contact.

258
00:25:58,098 --> 00:26:01,477
Your father was Oliver Lane,
the Pulitzer Prize-winning author.

259
00:26:01,502 --> 00:26:02,816
No pressure, right?

260
00:26:02,841 --> 00:26:04,752
My Dad used to say:

261
00:26:04,777 --> 00:26:08,596
"If you live an ordinary life,
all you have are ordinary stories.

262
00:26:08,621 --> 00:26:11,138
You have to live
a life of adventure."

263
00:26:12,215 --> 00:26:13,782
So.

264
00:26:14,247 --> 00:26:15,867
Here I am.

265
00:26:22,076 --> 00:26:23,596
Good Morning.

266
00:26:26,064 --> 00:26:29,752
We're starting over...
in every way.

267
00:26:29,777 --> 00:26:32,371
I'll have to figure out where to live,
how to live,

268
00:26:32,396 --> 00:26:33,696
who my friends will be.

269
00:26:33,721 --> 00:26:35,293
It's like the first day at school.

270
00:26:35,318 --> 00:26:38,483
And this school bus took
120 years to get there.

271
00:26:40,621 --> 00:26:42,740
We're creating a culture.

272
00:26:42,765 --> 00:26:44,112
You are funny.

273
00:26:44,113 --> 00:26:47,369
Do you ever read something and
feel like it's written just for you?

274
00:26:47,394 --> 00:26:49,406
I don't do a lot of reading.

275
00:26:49,431 --> 00:26:51,392
She is good.

276
00:26:51,861 --> 00:26:53,396
Who's that?

277
00:26:53,421 --> 00:26:55,025
Aurora.

278
00:26:55,050 --> 00:26:58,147
Ah.
The sleeping girl.

279
00:27:02,610 --> 00:27:04,542
You know, I'm not saying
the universe is evil

280
00:27:04,567 --> 00:27:06,611
but it sure has a nasty
sense of humor.

281
00:27:06,636 --> 00:27:07,677
How is that?

282
00:27:07,718 --> 00:27:12,557
You get to fly to another planet,
but you'll die on the way.

283
00:27:13,669 --> 00:27:16,404
And you find the perfect woman

284
00:27:17,492 --> 00:27:19,373
right in front of you.

285
00:27:20,436 --> 00:27:22,900
Yet, she's completely out of reach.

286
00:27:25,812 --> 00:27:27,971
Yeah, I'll miss New York.

287
00:27:27,996 --> 00:27:30,148
Give me a cup of coffee and
a view of the Chrysler Building,

288
00:27:30,173 --> 00:27:31,830
and I can write all day.

289
00:27:31,855 --> 00:27:34,041
But you have coffee on Homestead II, right?

290
00:27:34,066 --> 00:27:37,276
They better have coffee, if they don't
they have to turn around and go back to Earth.

HIBERNATION POD

293
00:27:58,139 --> 00:28:00,525
Say you were trapped
on a desert island,

294
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:03,183
you had the power to wish
somebody there with you.

295
00:28:03,208 --> 00:28:05,176
You wouldn't be alone.

296
00:28:05,885 --> 00:28:08,318
but you'd be stranding
another person on the island.

297
00:28:08,343 --> 00:28:10,740
How do you...
Would you make the wish?

298
00:28:10,777 --> 00:28:13,290
I don't know.
I've never been on an island.

299
00:28:13,291 --> 00:28:15,194
Okay, well...
Yeah.

300
00:28:16,150 --> 00:28:17,779
Forget the island.

301
00:28:18,350 --> 00:28:22,983
Say you figured out
how to do something

302
00:28:23,008 --> 00:28:24,803
that would make your life
a million times better.

303
00:28:24,828 --> 00:28:27,440
But you know it's wrong,
and there's no taking it back.

304
00:28:27,465 --> 00:28:28,865
How do you do the math?

305
00:28:28,890 --> 00:28:31,873
Jim.
These are not robot questions.

306
00:28:37,389 --> 00:28:39,771
I know how to wake Aurora up.

307
00:28:39,975 --> 00:28:43,119
That seems like a fine idea.
You could use some company.

308
00:28:43,144 --> 00:28:45,693
I'd be stranding her on this ship
for the rest of her life!

309
00:28:45,718 --> 00:28:48,578
Oh.
Well, you can't do that.

310
00:28:49,452 --> 00:28:50,925
What am I going to do?

311
00:28:50,950 --> 00:28:52,273
I'm here for you.

312
00:28:52,298 --> 00:28:54,733
Arthur, you're a machine.

313
00:28:58,426 --> 00:29:01,965
See, you can't feel that,
you don't have feelings.

314
00:29:04,558 --> 00:29:05,691
You see?

315
00:29:05,692 --> 00:29:07,389
That doesn't hurt.

316
00:29:07,454 --> 00:29:09,437
And you don't even mind.

317
00:29:09,886 --> 00:29:12,691
She...
a person.

318
00:29:19,279 --> 00:29:20,703
Don't even think about it.

319
00:29:20,728 --> 00:29:22,410
No more Aurora talk.

320
00:29:22,435 --> 00:29:24,087
I'm over it.

321
00:29:24,173 --> 00:29:25,840
I'm moving on.

322
00:29:28,433 --> 00:29:30,021
What am I going to do?
I'm going to sit and thinking about it?

323
00:29:30,046 --> 00:29:32,894
I'm not going to... I can't think about it.
So I'm not going to, that's the deal.

324
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,545
I've made my decision.
I know what I'm doing.

325
00:29:35,546 --> 00:29:37,393
I just cut it off.

326
00:29:39,220 --> 00:29:40,196
I'm not...
No more.

327
00:29:40,221 --> 00:29:41,856
You won't hear me bring
up her name again.

328
00:29:41,881 --> 00:29:44,085
I'll never even mention
her name again.

329
00:29:44,110 --> 00:29:45,535
Done.

330
00:29:47,682 --> 00:29:49,533
I can't do it.

331
00:29:54,482 --> 00:29:56,502
I'm shaving off my beard.

332
00:30:07,045 --> 00:30:08,895
Please don't do it.

333
00:32:00,984 --> 00:32:02,596
Good morning, Aurora.

334
00:32:02,597 --> 00:32:04,446
How're you feeling?

335
00:32:04,849 --> 00:32:07,599
It's perfectly normal to feel confused.

336
00:32:07,624 --> 00:32:11,308
You've just spent a 120 years
in suspended animation.

337
00:32:59,147 --> 00:33:01,272
Grand Concourse.

338
00:33:01,297 --> 00:33:02,844
Hello?

339
00:33:06,211 --> 00:33:07,964
Anybody?

340
00:33:16,567 --> 00:33:18,251
Hello.

341
00:33:21,334 --> 00:33:22,986
Hi.

342
00:33:25,209 --> 00:33:27,628
Are you passenger or crew?

343
00:33:29,546 --> 00:33:31,197
Passenger.

344
00:33:31,198 --> 00:33:32,540
Jim Preston.

345
00:33:32,565 --> 00:33:34,452
Aurora Lane.

346
00:33:35,562 --> 00:33:37,485
Do you know what's going on?

347
00:33:37,510 --> 00:33:40,016
Nobody else from
my row woke up.

348
00:33:40,689 --> 00:33:41,861
Same for me.

349
00:33:41,886 --> 00:33:45,418
The crew's supposed to wake up
a month before we do. But...

350
00:33:45,443 --> 00:33:47,359
I haven't seen them.

351
00:33:50,282 --> 00:33:52,389
The crew is still asleep.

352
00:33:53,826 --> 00:33:56,453
Are you saying nobody's awake?

353
00:33:56,454 --> 00:33:57,785
Just me.

354
00:33:57,833 --> 00:33:59,149
Just you?

355
00:33:59,174 --> 00:34:00,938
Just us.

356
00:34:01,339 --> 00:34:04,348
But somebody's got to land
the ship in a few weeks.

357
00:34:04,373 --> 00:34:08,029
We will arrive in approximately 89 years.

358
00:34:08,054 --> 00:34:10,445
89 years?

359
00:34:12,311 --> 00:34:15,618
The other passengers
aren't late waking up.

360
00:34:16,706 --> 00:34:18,736
We were early.

361
00:34:22,837 --> 00:34:25,314
We...
We need help.

362
00:34:25,339 --> 00:34:27,060
Where's the crew?

363
00:34:27,173 --> 00:34:29,939
The crew's in a secured
hibernation room.

364
00:34:29,964 --> 00:34:33,511
Everything important, the controls,
the reactors, the engines,

365
00:34:33,536 --> 00:34:36,719
it's all behind the firewall,
there's no way through.

366
00:34:47,142 --> 00:34:49,531
How long have you been awake?

367
00:34:50,169 --> 00:34:52,469
1 year and 3 weeks.

368
00:34:52,682 --> 00:34:55,128
No.
No.

369
00:34:56,173 --> 00:34:58,308
No, this can't be happening.

370
00:34:58,333 --> 00:35:00,569
We have to go back to sleep.

371
00:35:00,594 --> 00:35:02,652
Aurora, we can't.

372
00:35:04,857 --> 00:35:06,653
We just have to
get back to our pods

373
00:35:06,678 --> 00:35:08,416
and start them up again.

374
00:35:09,470 --> 00:35:12,283
I can't find my pod.
I can't find my pod.

375
00:35:12,308 --> 00:35:13,967
I can't find my pod.

376
00:35:14,643 --> 00:35:16,371
It doesn't matter.

377
00:35:17,492 --> 00:35:18,783
- Aurora.
- I can't find it.

378
00:35:18,808 --> 00:35:20,564
- Stop.
- I can't find which one is mine.

379
00:35:20,589 --> 00:35:22,169
- Stop.
- How do I know which one is mine?

380
00:35:22,194 --> 00:35:23,338
- You don't know.
- I can't...

381
00:35:23,363 --> 00:35:26,373
Stop.
It doesn't matter.

382
00:35:28,565 --> 00:35:32,418
Putting somebody into hibernation
requires special equipment.

383
00:35:32,443 --> 00:35:36,989
Remember the facility where they put us
under all the procedures we went through.

384
00:35:37,013 --> 00:35:39,354
These pods are designed
to keep us in hibernation,

385
00:35:39,380 --> 00:35:40,909
they'll wake us up
at the right time.

386
00:35:40,934 --> 00:35:42,752
They can't put us back to sleep.

387
00:35:42,777 --> 00:35:46,019
You don't think there's a way
back into hibernation.

388
00:35:47,011 --> 00:35:48,452
No.

389
00:35:48,477 --> 00:35:50,499
But there has to be.

390
00:35:50,821 --> 00:35:52,905
There has to be.

391
00:36:01,068 --> 00:36:04,610
9 o'clock.
Bedtime.

392
00:36:08,803 --> 00:36:12,148
I know I should be
working the problem but...

393
00:36:12,448 --> 00:36:14,882
I can't even keep my eyes open.

394
00:36:15,478 --> 00:36:17,381
You just came out of hibernation.

395
00:36:17,406 --> 00:36:19,718
It's going to be a couple
of days before you're 100%.

396
00:36:19,743 --> 00:36:21,810
You should get some rest.

397
00:36:22,326 --> 00:36:24,498
I think I'm going to have to.

398
00:36:25,358 --> 00:36:28,216
- I'll walk you to your cabin.
- No, it's okay.

399
00:36:28,241 --> 00:36:30,015
I'll be alright.

400
00:36:30,783 --> 00:36:32,438
Okay.

401
00:36:35,210 --> 00:36:37,117
Good night, Aurora.

402
00:36:38,619 --> 00:36:42,172
More than a year.
I can't imagine.

403
00:36:42,703 --> 00:36:44,928
It must have been
so hard for you.

404
00:36:45,081 --> 00:36:46,711
It was.

405
00:36:46,736 --> 00:36:48,513
Good night, Jim.

406
00:36:50,413 --> 00:36:53,599
Please buckle up and
secure any loose items.

407
00:36:56,267 --> 00:36:59,187
- Whiskey. Neat.
- Sure thing.

408
00:37:04,832 --> 00:37:06,713
How's your day been?

409
00:37:07,580 --> 00:37:09,174
Aurora's awake.

410
00:37:09,199 --> 00:37:11,324
Congratulations.

411
00:37:12,883 --> 00:37:14,866
You don't look happy.

412
00:37:18,625 --> 00:37:20,637
Arthur, can you keep a secret?

413
00:37:20,662 --> 00:37:25,166
Jim, I'm not just a bartender,
I'm a gentleman.

414
00:37:25,191 --> 00:37:27,924
Don't tell Aurora that I woke her up.

415
00:37:29,812 --> 00:37:32,713
She thinks it was an accident.
Let me tell her.

416
00:37:32,738 --> 00:37:34,440
Of course.

417
00:37:47,344 --> 00:37:49,839
How can there be no way to put
someone back into hibernation?

418
00:37:49,864 --> 00:37:51,323
What if a pod breaks down?

419
00:37:51,348 --> 00:37:55,798
No hibernation pod has malfunctioned
in thousands of interstellar flights.

420
00:37:56,146 --> 00:37:58,719
Well, I'm awake.

421
00:37:58,744 --> 00:38:01,551
Hibernation pods are fail-safe.

422
00:38:01,576 --> 00:38:03,910
Good morning.
Have you eaten?

423
00:38:03,935 --> 00:38:06,013
No, I'm starving.

424
00:38:06,038 --> 00:38:08,374
And this is the dumbest machine.

425
00:38:08,399 --> 00:38:10,261
Happy to help!

426
00:38:16,462 --> 00:38:18,358
<font color="#ff8080">INFO_M_MC</font>

427
00:38:18,383 --> 00:38:22,067
<font color="#ff8080">INFO_M_MC
CRITICAL ERROR</font>

428
00:38:22,653 --> 00:38:24,929
Gold-class breakfast.

429
00:38:35,221 --> 00:38:37,439
Well, you're a man of simple tastes.

430
00:38:37,464 --> 00:38:39,942
I'm not a gold-class passenger.

431
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,110
French Breakfast Puff
is above my pay grade.

432
00:38:44,135 --> 00:38:45,834
What?
This whole time?

433
00:38:45,859 --> 00:38:47,618
- Yeah.
- What can I get you?

434
00:38:47,643 --> 00:38:49,558
- No, I'm fine,
- Stop it.

435
00:38:49,583 --> 00:38:51,774
really...
Okay.

436
00:38:53,105 --> 00:38:54,837
Here you go.

437
00:38:59,580 --> 00:39:00,982
Yeah.

438
00:39:01,007 --> 00:39:02,713
So, I was thinking.

439
00:39:02,738 --> 00:39:05,524
Maybe there's another way to go to sleep.
What about the infirmary?

440
00:39:05,549 --> 00:39:07,953
I've checked it out.
It's just scanners and an autodoc.

441
00:39:07,978 --> 00:39:10,417
There could be another
hibernation machine in the cargo hold.

442
00:39:10,418 --> 00:39:11,800
I've had that thought too.

443
00:39:11,825 --> 00:39:13,051
And I read the manifests.

444
00:39:13,052 --> 00:39:15,543
It's mostly farming stuff,
machines.

445
00:39:15,568 --> 00:39:17,886
replacement parts for
computers in Engineering.

446
00:39:17,903 --> 00:39:20,218
We're not going to find
a hibernation facility in a box.

447
00:39:20,243 --> 00:39:21,934
- We can build our own.
- We can't.

448
00:39:21,935 --> 00:39:25,739
- Jim, you're not even trying!
- I've tried everything.

449
00:39:25,764 --> 00:39:27,776
For over a year.

450
00:39:28,887 --> 00:39:30,808
I've tried everything.

451
00:39:33,160 --> 00:39:35,376
Oh well, I'm not ready to give up.

452
00:39:44,042 --> 00:39:46,079
Infirmary.

453
00:39:53,564 --> 00:39:56,330
What about research articles,
any kind of technical documents?

454
00:39:56,355 --> 00:39:59,072
Hibernation technology is proprietary.

455
00:39:59,097 --> 00:40:03,560
The following articles deal with
the subject on a theoretical level.

456
00:40:46,176 --> 00:40:49,260
New file.
My Voyage.

457
00:40:49,432 --> 00:40:53,439
I boarded the Avalon with an idea,
a destiny.

458
00:40:53,900 --> 00:40:57,965
But now, out of reach.

459
00:40:59,788 --> 00:41:02,188
I've been awake for 7 days,

460
00:41:02,213 --> 00:41:04,781
awake far too soon...

461
00:41:04,806 --> 00:41:07,658
and I may well spend
the rest of my life here...

462
00:41:07,683 --> 00:41:11,935
...in a steel world a 1,000 meters long.

463
00:41:13,013 --> 00:41:15,049
There's another passenger awake.

464
00:41:15,074 --> 00:41:17,936
A mechanic named Jim Preston.

465
00:41:19,601 --> 00:41:22,394
He seems to have accepted our fate.

466
00:41:22,978 --> 00:41:25,004
But I'm scared.

467
00:41:25,724 --> 00:41:28,303
I'm fighting to stay calm.

468
00:41:30,306 --> 00:41:35,523
All the other passengers will sleep
for another 90 years.

469
00:41:36,166 --> 00:41:41,701
While I roam about my life on this ship...
traveling forever...

470
00:41:42,318 --> 00:41:44,245
never arriving.

471
00:41:44,831 --> 00:41:47,750
My only companion, a total stranger.

472
00:41:56,523 --> 00:41:58,296
Why did you do it?

473
00:42:00,449 --> 00:42:02,063
Do what?

474
00:42:02,928 --> 00:42:05,568
Emigrate.
Leave Earth.

475
00:42:06,433 --> 00:42:08,396
I'm interviewing you.

476
00:42:08,421 --> 00:42:09,331
You're what?

477
00:42:09,356 --> 00:42:12,813
You're the first hibernation failure
in the history of space travel.

478
00:42:12,838 --> 00:42:14,784
That makes you a story.

479
00:42:14,890 --> 00:42:17,510
- Who are you going to tell?
- Posterity.

480
00:42:17,535 --> 00:42:20,813
So why did you give up
your life on Earth?

481
00:42:20,838 --> 00:42:25,286
A 120 years space hibernation means you
never see your family or friends again.

482
00:42:25,289 --> 00:42:28,995
You'll wake up in a new century,
on a new planet.

483
00:42:29,135 --> 00:42:31,439
It's the ultimate geographical suicide.

484
00:42:31,464 --> 00:42:33,680
Well, I could ask you the same thing.

485
00:42:33,705 --> 00:42:35,657
But it's my interview.

486
00:42:35,991 --> 00:42:38,015
Were you running away from something?

487
00:42:38,040 --> 00:42:39,460
No.

488
00:42:39,790 --> 00:42:41,938
- Everything is okay.
- So?

489
00:42:42,207 --> 00:42:44,868
I guess I just wanted a new world.
I don't know, a fresh start.

490
00:42:44,893 --> 00:42:46,977
That's HomeStead Company advertising.

491
00:42:47,002 --> 00:42:48,467
- Is it?
- Jim.

492
00:42:48,492 --> 00:42:51,269
I... I know.
I guess, you're right.

493
00:42:55,881 --> 00:42:59,192
Back on Earth, when something breaks,
you don't fix it, you replace it.

494
00:42:59,664 --> 00:43:02,469
In the colonies, they have problems to solve.

495
00:43:02,494 --> 00:43:04,448
My kind of problems.

496
00:43:05,832 --> 00:43:08,098
The mechanic is similar.

497
00:43:08,123 --> 00:43:10,613
It's a new world still being built.

498
00:43:12,513 --> 00:43:14,793
I can build a house and live in it.

499
00:43:19,425 --> 00:43:22,404
Open country,
room to grow.

500
00:43:22,429 --> 00:43:24,030
Now you're back to slogans.

501
00:43:24,055 --> 00:43:26,205
Can't slogans be true?

502
00:43:27,517 --> 00:43:30,963
Do you know how much Homestead
Company's made off its first planet?

503
00:43:30,988 --> 00:43:33,179
8 quadrillion dollars.

504
00:43:33,204 --> 00:43:35,890
That's 8 million billions.

505
00:43:35,915 --> 00:43:38,651
Colony planets are the
biggest business now.

506
00:43:38,823 --> 00:43:40,601
Did you pay full price
for your ticket?

507
00:43:40,626 --> 00:43:43,041
No, I'm in a desirable trade.

508
00:43:43,066 --> 00:43:46,778
So they fill your head with dreams,

509
00:43:46,803 --> 00:43:49,601
discount your ticket, and you
fly off to populate their planet

510
00:43:49,625 --> 00:43:52,633
and give HomeStead 20% of everything
you made for the rest of your life.

511
00:43:52,658 --> 00:43:55,944
Not to mention the debt you're
going to owe on this fancy starship.

512
00:43:55,969 --> 00:43:59,077
So all you see here
is 5,000 suckers?

513
00:43:59,234 --> 00:44:02,970
I see zeroes on the
HomeStead Company's bottom line.

514
00:44:02,995 --> 00:44:06,417
I see 5,000 men and women
changing their lives.

515
00:44:06,946 --> 00:44:09,623
5,000 different reasons.
You don't know these people.

516
00:44:09,648 --> 00:44:12,854
I'm a journalist. I know how people.

517
00:44:14,199 --> 00:44:15,933
Really?

518
00:44:15,958 --> 00:44:17,375
This one.

519
00:44:17,400 --> 00:44:20,551
Is he a banker, a teacher or a gardener?

520
00:44:21,396 --> 00:44:24,009
- Banker.
- He's a gardener.

521
00:44:24,788 --> 00:44:30,587
And her, is she a
Maddison, Donna or Lola?

522
00:44:31,512 --> 00:44:33,862
Donna's too serious for that hair.

523
00:44:33,887 --> 00:44:35,499
Lola.

524
00:44:35,632 --> 00:44:37,997
- Maddison.
- Shit.

525
00:44:39,819 --> 00:44:40,865
Alright.

526
00:44:40,890 --> 00:44:42,956
Chef, accountant or midwife?

527
00:44:42,981 --> 00:44:45,676
She has to be a midwife.
There's no way you just made that one up.

528
00:44:45,701 --> 00:44:47,505
She is a midwife.

529
00:44:48,490 --> 00:44:50,735
Good to know
they still have midwives.

530
00:44:52,731 --> 00:44:55,746
I liked her.
We would be friends.

531
00:44:55,771 --> 00:44:57,710
You think you can see that?

532
00:44:57,735 --> 00:44:59,453
Don't you?

533
00:45:01,245 --> 00:45:02,688
I do.

534
00:45:02,713 --> 00:45:04,489
A round trip ticket.

535
00:45:04,514 --> 00:45:07,003
That's right.
I was going to fly to Homestead II,

536
00:45:07,028 --> 00:45:09,203
live for a year and
right back to Earth.

537
00:45:09,228 --> 00:45:11,007
I don't get it.
I left Earth for a new life.

538
00:45:11,032 --> 00:45:12,603
But you end up back
where you started.

539
00:45:12,604 --> 00:45:16,651
I end up in the future.
250 years in the future.

540
00:45:16,676 --> 00:45:21,154
On Earth, which is still the
center of civilization, like it or not.

541
00:45:21,694 --> 00:45:25,319
And I would be the only writer that ever
travel to the colony world and come back.

542
00:45:25,345 --> 00:45:27,207
I'll have a story 
no one else can tell.

543
00:45:27,232 --> 00:45:28,802
What story?

544
00:45:28,827 --> 00:45:31,267
Humanity's flight to the stars.

545
00:45:31,292 --> 00:45:35,013
The greatest migration in human history.
It's the biggest story there is.

546
00:45:35,038 --> 00:45:36,749
But you won't know any of the
people who were reading it.

547
00:45:36,774 --> 00:45:38,644
But they'd be reading it.

548
00:45:41,004 --> 00:45:42,692
Well, they would.
But...

549
00:45:44,210 --> 00:45:45,972
I'll never write it now.

550
00:45:45,997 --> 00:45:48,423
I don't know if
I'll ever write again.

551
00:45:50,263 --> 00:45:53,989
Jim, I can't think of anything else to try

552
00:45:54,014 --> 00:45:56,107
...to save us.

553
00:45:57,494 --> 00:46:00,197
And I don't even want to
think about it anymore.

554
00:46:02,433 --> 00:46:04,791
What is there to do around here?

555
00:46:06,793 --> 00:46:09,699
- Are you serious?
- I'm dead serious.

556
00:46:09,700 --> 00:46:11,365
Partner mode.

557
00:46:12,909 --> 00:46:14,826
Come on, get in harmony.

558
00:46:21,256 --> 00:46:25,036
You just stand here,
and then we repeat what they do.

559
00:46:32,628 --> 00:46:34,804
Is there anything else we can do?

560
00:46:34,829 --> 00:46:36,031
- Just do the...
- Okay.

561
00:46:36,056 --> 00:46:37,700
- You don't have to.
- Okay.

562
00:46:38,633 --> 00:46:40,131
Hey.

563
00:46:40,156 --> 00:46:42,063
Here we go.
Let's see if... Oh.

564
00:46:42,088 --> 00:46:44,021
Whoa!
Whoa!

565
00:46:44,506 --> 00:46:46,733
Oh.
Why are you smiling?

566
00:46:46,758 --> 00:46:48,969
I'm up 2 points.

567
00:46:49,240 --> 00:46:50,655
Who's the lovely lady?

568
00:46:50,687 --> 00:46:52,048
This is Aurora.

569
00:46:52,073 --> 00:46:54,937
Aurora.
A pleasure.

570
00:46:57,722 --> 00:46:59,860
- You did great!
- Okay. One more time.

571
00:46:59,885 --> 00:47:01,275
One more time.
Easy.

572
00:47:01,300 --> 00:47:03,315
<font color="#80ffff">Fantasy Drama</font>

573
00:47:07,325 --> 00:47:08,665
Oh!

574
00:47:12,873 --> 00:47:14,495
- YES!
- Woo!

575
00:47:17,147 --> 00:47:19,164
Sorry I didn't wear pants for a month.

576
00:47:19,189 --> 00:47:21,589
It's 7 weeks and 2 days,
to be exact.

577
00:47:21,614 --> 00:47:23,110
The man has no shame.

578
00:47:23,135 --> 00:47:26,516
Well, you're a little lack and
you're rather low yourself , Arthur.

579
00:47:28,957 --> 00:47:33,252
I laughed at a man with no pants
until I realised I have no legs.

580
00:47:39,229 --> 00:47:42,201
For a minute, I almost forgot
my life isn't ruined.

581
00:47:42,226 --> 00:47:43,770
I'm sorry.

582
00:47:44,085 --> 00:47:45,952
What for?

583
00:47:46,812 --> 00:47:48,531
I'm going to go to bed.

584
00:47:49,265 --> 00:47:50,795
- Good night.
- Alright.

585
00:47:50,820 --> 00:47:52,744
Good night, Aurora.

586
00:47:55,421 --> 00:47:58,166
She is wonderful.

587
00:47:58,483 --> 00:48:00,492
Excellent choice.

588
00:49:27,813 --> 00:49:29,287
Hello.

589
00:49:29,575 --> 00:49:31,065
Hi.

590
00:49:31,145 --> 00:49:32,890
Here you go.

591
00:49:38,531 --> 00:49:40,415
Is he asking me on a date?

592
00:49:42,431 --> 00:49:44,195
Do you need a pen?

593
00:49:56,733 --> 00:49:58,992
She didn't seem that impressed.

594
00:50:16,671 --> 00:50:19,087
"Love to."
She wrote "Love to".

595
00:50:26,767 --> 00:50:28,927
You have a visitor.

596
00:50:47,125 --> 00:50:48,241
Wow.

597
00:50:48,266 --> 00:50:50,549
You clean up pretty good yourself.

598
00:50:51,326 --> 00:50:54,536
- You went shopping.
- I went shop... lifting.

599
00:50:59,352 --> 00:51:01,702
Evening.
What can I get for you?

600
00:51:01,727 --> 00:51:04,372
I'll have a Manhattan, please.

601
00:51:05,202 --> 00:51:07,615
- Whiskey rocks.
- Coming up.

602
00:51:15,446 --> 00:51:17,260
You two look fine this evening.

603
00:51:17,285 --> 00:51:18,770
Thank you, Arthur.

604
00:51:18,795 --> 00:51:20,392
We're on a date!

605
00:51:20,417 --> 00:51:22,484
Very nice.

606
00:51:22,509 --> 00:51:24,671
Took you long enough to ask.

607
00:51:24,673 --> 00:51:26,367
I was giving you space.

608
00:51:26,392 --> 00:51:27,721
Oh.

609
00:51:27,834 --> 00:51:31,830
Space, the one thing
I do not need any more of.

610
00:51:34,846 --> 00:51:36,795
Thank you very much.

611
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,222
That was so good.

612
00:51:39,247 --> 00:51:41,196
Well, it wasn't easy
getting a reservation.

613
00:51:41,221 --> 00:51:43,617
They probably going to want
us to give up our table.

614
00:51:43,642 --> 00:51:46,914
- Getting a lot of dirty looks.
- Very popular tonight.

615
00:51:48,632 --> 00:51:50,259
So how's your book coming?

616
00:51:50,284 --> 00:51:52,690
Well, I don't know what it is yet.

617
00:51:53,432 --> 00:51:56,085
My dad, he started to
write about his life, but...

618
00:51:56,110 --> 00:51:58,137
he had stories.
He...

619
00:51:58,465 --> 00:52:01,087
sailed around Antarctica.
He...

620
00:52:01,112 --> 00:52:05,010
was a war reporter.
He... had lovers.

621
00:52:05,057 --> 00:52:07,248
He wrote about his daughter.

622
00:52:07,273 --> 00:52:09,037
- And what about you?
- No.

623
00:52:09,062 --> 00:52:11,036
I grew up reading
about myself in his books.

624
00:52:11,061 --> 00:52:12,559
How was that?

625
00:52:13,332 --> 00:52:14,683
It's always easy.

626
00:52:14,708 --> 00:52:17,611
A little more than you wanted
to know about yourself.

627
00:52:17,636 --> 00:52:23,001
I mean, when I was 17,
he had a heart attack.

628
00:52:24,095 --> 00:52:26,101
I-I just keep that.

629
00:52:26,602 --> 00:52:28,492
End of story.

630
00:52:31,197 --> 00:52:34,299
Oh, so serious.
I'm sorry.

631
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:35,511
We need more wine.

632
00:52:35,536 --> 00:52:37,780
I like to hear about your life.

633
00:52:38,782 --> 00:52:40,283
Thanks.

634
00:52:42,420 --> 00:52:43,900
Why are we here?

635
00:52:43,925 --> 00:52:45,505
You'll see.

636
00:52:47,172 --> 00:52:49,009
Best show in town.

637
00:52:52,588 --> 00:52:54,608
So you've done this before?

638
00:52:54,633 --> 00:52:56,347
Oh yeah.

639
00:52:56,372 --> 00:52:57,792
And it's safe?

640
00:52:57,817 --> 00:52:59,340
No.

641
00:53:00,270 --> 00:53:02,050
Reasonably safe.

642
00:53:03,389 --> 00:53:06,127
Hop in.
You're next.

643
00:53:07,195 --> 00:53:09,110
What about my dress?

644
00:53:11,335 --> 00:53:13,118
Right.

645
00:53:15,337 --> 00:53:17,156
Turn around.

646
00:53:47,700 --> 00:53:49,509
Tail attached.

647
00:54:30,010 --> 00:54:31,621
What are you doing?

648
00:54:31,969 --> 00:54:33,764
Do you trust me?

649
00:55:20,386 --> 00:55:22,192
Thank you.

650
00:56:10,861 --> 00:56:13,746
You're the most beautiful woman
I've ever seen.

651
00:56:16,809 --> 00:56:18,825
You kill me.

652
00:57:01,022 --> 00:57:02,872
You okay?

653
00:57:03,085 --> 00:57:04,499
Yeah.

654
00:57:06,216 --> 00:57:07,901
I am fine.

655
00:57:08,069 --> 00:57:09,591
It's just...

656
00:57:17,065 --> 00:57:18,916
Yeah, I know.

657
00:57:34,439 --> 00:57:37,178
So, I'm seeing someone.

658
00:57:37,203 --> 00:57:39,076
You'll never guess who.

659
00:57:40,314 --> 00:57:44,016
We're the last 2 people in the world
do whatever to get together.

660
00:57:44,041 --> 00:57:45,787
But here we are.

661
00:57:45,788 --> 00:57:47,769
The last 2 people in the world.

662
00:57:47,794 --> 00:57:48,892
What did you say?

663
00:57:48,917 --> 00:57:51,157
I'm writing, Arthur, hush.

664
00:57:51,498 --> 00:57:54,698
Jim and I live in
an accidental happiness.

665
00:57:54,723 --> 00:57:57,806
Like castaways making their home
on strange shores.

666
00:57:57,831 --> 00:57:59,983
"strange shores".
I love it.

667
00:58:00,008 --> 00:58:01,482
You do?
You don't have to say that.

668
00:58:01,506 --> 00:58:03,919
- I know.
- You're not going to eat this?

669
00:58:06,098 --> 00:58:08,095
Something fishy to you?

670
00:58:09,718 --> 00:58:11,210
Keep reading.

671
00:58:11,235 --> 00:58:12,761
It's funny.

672
00:58:12,786 --> 00:58:15,004
We all have dreams.

673
00:58:15,344 --> 00:58:19,285
We planned our futures and
we're the captains of our fates.

674
00:58:19,494 --> 00:58:21,192
But we are passengers.

675
00:58:21,217 --> 00:58:23,934
We go where fate takes us.

676
00:58:26,707 --> 00:58:27,729
Arthur!

677
00:58:27,754 --> 00:58:29,735
This isn't the life we ​​planned.

678
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,543
But it's ours.

679
00:58:31,568 --> 00:58:34,145
And for the first time in my life,

680
00:58:34,170 --> 00:58:36,281
I don't feel alone.

681
00:58:38,652 --> 00:58:41,187
We weren't suppose
to find each other,

682
00:58:42,387 --> 00:58:44,070
but we did.

683
00:58:44,603 --> 00:58:47,745
It makes me feel like
my life isn't over.

684
00:58:47,898 --> 00:58:50,080
Like it's just beginning.

685
00:58:50,656 --> 00:58:51,792
How was your day?

686
00:58:51,817 --> 00:58:54,125
Good, I wrote a few pages.

687
00:58:54,150 --> 00:58:56,411
Did you find anything
that can help us?

688
00:58:59,646 --> 00:59:02,310
- I did.
- Are they real?

689
00:59:02,335 --> 00:59:04,542
I cut them myself.

690
00:59:07,653 --> 00:59:11,195
You know for 2 unlucky people,
we sure felt pretty lucky.

691
00:59:16,027 --> 00:59:17,475
Attention.

692
00:59:17,500 --> 00:59:21,221
You may wish to proceed
to a Viewing Area.

693
00:59:21,237 --> 00:59:25,467
The Avalon will slingshot
around the star Arcturus.

694
01:00:03,383 --> 01:00:05,497
That was amazing.

695
01:00:07,079 --> 01:00:09,235
We were a child.

696
01:00:13,399 --> 01:00:15,763
The universe is a present to you.

697
01:00:15,968 --> 01:00:17,440
What?

698
01:00:18,517 --> 01:00:20,633
Happy birthday.

699
01:00:27,176 --> 01:00:35,783
Happy birthday to you...
Happy birthday to you...

700
01:00:35,808 --> 01:00:40,159
Happy birthday, dear Aurora...

701
01:00:40,184 --> 01:00:44,606
Happy birthday to you.

702
01:00:46,357 --> 01:00:48,375
Birthday drink for the birthday girl.

703
01:00:48,400 --> 01:00:50,759
Aren't you going to ask for my I.D.?
I might not be old enough to drink.

704
01:00:50,788 --> 01:00:53,718
Oh, I'd never ask your age
in front of a gentleman.

705
01:00:53,743 --> 01:00:55,171
Jim is no gentleman.

706
01:00:55,196 --> 01:00:58,042
Anyway there's no secrets
between me and Jim.

707
01:00:58,953 --> 01:01:00,303
Is that so?

708
01:01:00,328 --> 01:01:04,034
You heard the lady.
I will be right back.

709
01:01:18,201 --> 01:01:20,859
This is a perfect birthday drink,
thank you.

710
01:01:20,883 --> 01:01:24,057
I remember this day, a year ago.

711
01:01:24,083 --> 01:01:26,986
Jim was so looking forward
to meeting you.

712
01:01:27,398 --> 01:01:28,801
What?

713
01:01:29,119 --> 01:01:31,071
How could he be
looking forward to it?

714
01:01:31,096 --> 01:01:34,619
Oh, he spent months deciding
whether to wake you up.

715
01:01:34,644 --> 01:01:37,655
He couldn't stop talking about you.

716
01:01:41,312 --> 01:01:43,423
Jim woke me up.

717
01:01:43,883 --> 01:01:45,373
Oh, yes.

718
01:01:45,900 --> 01:01:48,806
He said it was the
hardest decision of his life,

719
01:01:48,831 --> 01:01:51,941
but I see it
worked out just fine.

720
01:02:03,873 --> 01:02:05,386
What?

721
01:02:07,746 --> 01:02:10,018
Did you wake me up?

722
01:02:17,310 --> 01:02:19,313
Yes.
I woke you up.

723
01:02:23,228 --> 01:02:24,975
How...

724
01:02:25,190 --> 01:02:27,171
How could you do it?

725
01:02:29,562 --> 01:02:31,402
I tried not to.

726
01:02:37,609 --> 01:02:39,644
I'm going to be sick.

727
01:02:40,200 --> 01:02:42,329
I can't see!

728
01:02:43,561 --> 01:02:45,349
Aurora, please.

729
01:02:45,374 --> 01:02:48,546
Stay away from me!

730
01:02:51,252 --> 01:02:54,471
.

731
01:02:54,496 --> 01:02:55,997
.

732
01:04:11,077 --> 01:04:13,197
Can I talk to you?

733
01:05:41,105 --> 01:05:42,959
Aurora.

734
01:05:43,092 --> 01:05:46,399
I know nothing I can say
will make this okay.

735
01:05:46,698 --> 01:05:48,681
But please listen.

736
01:05:48,706 --> 01:05:50,734
I was so alone

737
01:05:51,007 --> 01:05:52,995
for so long.

738
01:05:54,096 --> 01:05:56,509
I felt like I was disappearing.

739
01:05:57,190 --> 01:06:00,562
The night I first saw you,
I was ready to...

740
01:06:03,498 --> 01:06:05,591
You saved my life.

741
01:06:07,886 --> 01:06:11,061
And I know there's no excuse
for what I did.

742
01:06:12,386 --> 01:06:14,515
I read everything you wrote.

743
01:06:14,540 --> 01:06:18,203
And I fell in love
with your voice

744
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:21,323
and with the way
your mind works.

745
01:06:21,359 --> 01:06:23,611
I fell in love with you.

746
01:06:24,796 --> 01:06:26,717
And all of a sudden,

747
01:06:26,895 --> 01:06:30,804
it's like I wasn't trapped anymore.

748
01:06:30,882 --> 01:06:34,355
My pointless life suddenly had meaning.

749
01:06:36,597 --> 01:06:38,777
And I wish I could take it back.

750
01:06:40,156 --> 01:06:41,930
But I can't.

751
01:06:43,270 --> 01:06:44,802
Aurora, I don't want to lose you.

752
01:06:44,827 --> 01:06:47,196
I DON'T CARE !!!

753
01:06:47,221 --> 01:06:49,424
I don't care what you want!

754
01:06:49,449 --> 01:06:52,185
I don't care
why you woke me up!

755
01:06:52,595 --> 01:06:55,702
You took my life!

756
01:07:18,260 --> 01:07:19,815
Please standby.

757
01:07:19,840 --> 01:07:23,545
Your suite's control center is rebooting.

758
01:07:42,481 --> 01:07:44,390

759
01:07:44,415 --> 01:07:47,319
<font color="#ff8080">DIAGNOSTIC SYSTEM FAILURE</font>
CRITICAL ERROR

760
01:07:58,283 --> 01:08:00,403
I envy you, Arthur.

761
01:08:00,909 --> 01:08:02,218
How so?

762
01:08:02,243 --> 01:08:04,262
You have a purpose.

763
01:08:06,500 --> 01:08:08,522
You're always happy.

764
01:08:08,865 --> 01:08:11,256
How's your book coming along?

765
01:08:11,426 --> 01:08:13,772
I've never written about me before.

766
01:08:13,797 --> 01:08:15,721
I think it's some of the
best work I've ever done,

767
01:08:15,746 --> 01:08:18,230
and I don't even know
why I'm doing it.

768
01:08:18,935 --> 01:08:22,001
There's only one person who could read it
and I can't stand him.

769
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:26,143
They say time heals all wounds.

770
01:08:28,617 --> 01:08:31,178
Broken hearts aren't that simple.

771
01:08:33,808 --> 01:08:36,117
You wouldn't understand.

772
01:08:36,931 --> 01:08:38,730
Arthur!

773
01:08:42,967 --> 01:08:44,928
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

774
01:08:44,953 --> 01:08:46,857
It's Wednesday.

775
01:08:54,463 --> 01:08:56,256
The bar is all yours.

776
01:09:04,613 --> 01:09:06,960
What will you have?
Whiskey?

777
01:09:07,737 --> 01:09:09,223
Coffee.

778
01:09:09,248 --> 01:09:11,291
- Aurora, we love you!
- Aurora, we love you!

779
01:09:11,316 --> 01:09:13,521
What are we going
to do without you?

780
01:09:16,153 --> 01:09:17,492
The bravest woman I know.

781
01:09:17,517 --> 01:09:19,070
- Hi, Aurora!
- Hi, Aurora!

782
01:09:19,095 --> 01:09:22,824
I promise that
I'll think of you every day.

783
01:09:22,849 --> 01:09:24,959
When you wake up
I'll be gone,

784
01:09:24,984 --> 01:09:28,183
but just know that
I'll never forget you.

785
01:09:28,606 --> 01:09:30,511
You're my best friend.

786
01:09:31,450 --> 01:09:33,961
You were never happy here,
I know.

787
01:09:34,269 --> 01:09:36,649
Nothing was ever enough for you.

788
01:09:38,109 --> 01:09:40,546
You know, you don't have to go.
You could-

789
01:09:40,571 --> 01:09:43,595
You could do whatever it is
you have to do right here.

790
01:09:45,364 --> 01:09:46,627
Whatever.

791
01:09:46,652 --> 01:09:50,427
Since you're going,
here's my wish.

792
01:09:52,095 --> 01:09:56,390
I hope you finally find someone
who fills your heart. And...

793
01:09:57,080 --> 01:09:59,268
I hope you let him in.

794
01:10:00,459 --> 01:10:05,301
I hope you'd realize you don't have
to do something amazing to be happy.

795
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:08,201
Go.

796
01:10:08,226 --> 01:10:09,875
Have fun.

797
01:10:10,337 --> 01:10:12,344
Take chances.

798
01:10:13,795 --> 01:10:16,105
Um, okay.

799
01:10:17,059 --> 01:10:19,057
I love you, Aurora.

800
01:10:19,326 --> 01:10:20,710
Bye.

801
01:10:23,517 --> 01:10:25,324
Morning, Arthur!

802
01:10:25,478 --> 01:10:26,509
Coffee please.

803
01:10:26,534 --> 01:10:27,946
Coming up.

804
01:10:33,318 --> 01:10:35,563
Are you soiling my bar stool?

805
01:10:35,588 --> 01:10:38,743
You want to make things,
you got to get your hands dirty.

806
01:10:38,894 --> 01:10:42,075
- And what have you been making?
- Improvements.

807
01:10:42,701 --> 01:10:44,912
Grand Concourse.

808
01:11:11,901 --> 01:11:13,833
First floor.

809
01:11:26,451 --> 01:11:28,528
Gold-class breakfast.

810
01:11:28,553 --> 01:11:29,917
Huh!

811
01:11:44,466 --> 01:11:47,078
This is Deck Chief Gus Mancuso.

812
01:11:47,888 --> 01:11:51,118
Who the hell planted
a tree on my ship?

813
01:12:12,465 --> 01:12:15,029
- Who did that?
- I did.

814
01:12:15,054 --> 01:12:16,292
Who are you?

815
01:12:16,317 --> 01:12:18,018
Jim Preston.

816
01:12:19,086 --> 01:12:20,715
Aurora Lane.

817
01:12:20,740 --> 01:12:22,178
Anybody else awake?

818
01:12:22,203 --> 01:12:23,904
Just me and him.

819
01:12:24,225 --> 01:12:26,555
How far along are we?

820
01:12:26,580 --> 01:12:28,735
88 years to go.

821
01:12:36,465 --> 01:12:38,637
Hibernation failure.

822
01:12:39,583 --> 01:12:41,326
They said that couldn't happen.

823
01:12:41,351 --> 01:12:45,390
But 3 people,
3 pod failures.

824
01:12:49,864 --> 01:12:52,587
You have no idea how long
I've been trying to get in here.

825
01:12:52,612 --> 01:12:55,257
Now that you're in.
Don't touch anything.

826
01:12:55,282 --> 01:12:56,780
This is where you work?

827
01:12:56,805 --> 01:12:59,440
No, this is flight crew,
I'm a Deck Chief.

828
01:13:00,149 --> 01:13:03,040
Navigation comp.

829
01:13:05,203 --> 01:13:07,745
Unauthorized personnel.

830
01:13:08,611 --> 01:13:10,104
Sorry.

831
01:13:11,765 --> 01:13:15,027
If I'm reading this right,
we're still on course.

832
01:13:15,052 --> 01:13:17,803
So whatever's wrong with the ship,
NavComp's still on the job.

833
01:13:17,828 --> 01:13:19,364
There's something wrong with the ship?

834
01:13:19,389 --> 01:13:21,055
3 pod failures?
Yeah.

835
01:13:21,080 --> 01:13:23,904
There's something wrong.
Question is what.

836
01:13:26,289 --> 01:13:27,915
That's strange.

837
01:13:27,940 --> 01:13:30,501
I should be getting diagnostics
from all over the ship right here,

838
01:13:30,526 --> 01:13:32,812
but there's no data.

839
01:13:34,265 --> 01:13:36,135
We gave to check
all the systems manually.

840
01:13:36,160 --> 01:13:38,086
Can't we turn the ship around?
Go back to Earth?

841
01:13:38,111 --> 01:13:39,708
We're doing 50% of lightspeed.

842
01:13:39,733 --> 01:13:41,980
Turning back would take just
as much time as going on.

843
01:13:42,005 --> 01:13:43,812
Well, there's got to be
something we can do!

844
01:13:43,837 --> 01:13:46,573
Sorry, we're going where we're going.

845
01:13:49,111 --> 01:13:50,586
You okay?

846
01:13:51,156 --> 01:13:52,880
Hibernation hangover.

847
01:13:52,905 --> 01:13:54,699
Get it all the time.

848
01:13:54,848 --> 01:13:56,757
Grand Concourse.

849
01:13:56,782 --> 01:14:00,509
2 years, huh?
Any more trees I need to know about?

850
01:14:00,534 --> 01:14:01,853
LOOK OUT!

851
01:14:06,165 --> 01:14:07,989
I've never seen this happen before.

852
01:14:07,990 --> 01:14:09,921
Those robots have been breaking down.

853
01:14:09,946 --> 01:14:13,110
This guy makes 15?

854
01:14:13,217 --> 01:14:14,174
15.

855
01:14:14,208 --> 01:14:15,885
The breakfast spun crazy today.

856
01:14:15,910 --> 01:14:16,982
And the elevator.

857
01:14:17,007 --> 01:14:19,971
Last week my door broke.
I was trapped in my cabin for 2 days.

858
01:14:19,996 --> 01:14:21,610
You were?

859
01:14:21,762 --> 01:14:25,043
Things like that don't happen.
Not on this ship.

860
01:14:25,068 --> 01:14:28,343
There are 60 of these
tech-stations on every deck.

861
01:14:28,368 --> 01:14:30,101
Dock this way.

862
01:14:30,126 --> 01:14:31,850
Data stays on the map.
You got it?

863
01:14:31,875 --> 01:14:33,184
- Mm.
- Yeah.

864
01:14:33,603 --> 01:14:35,903
You take decks 1 and 2.
You take decks 3 and 4.

865
01:14:35,935 --> 01:14:40,110
I'm going down to the Hibernation Bay,
to check our pods.

866
01:14:40,523 --> 01:14:42,638
Now that should be interesting.

867
01:14:52,792 --> 01:14:55,313
Aren't you supposed to be making rounds.

868
01:14:55,519 --> 01:14:57,439
I finished.

869
01:14:59,575 --> 01:15:01,644
I checked your pod.

870
01:15:02,356 --> 01:15:04,973
The problem's very simple.
The clock chips burned out.

871
01:15:04,998 --> 01:15:07,817
It ain't supposed to happen,
but pretty simple.

872
01:15:07,842 --> 01:15:09,502
My pod was more complicated.

873
01:15:09,527 --> 01:15:12,368
A bunch of system failures,
it all happened at the same time,

874
01:15:12,393 --> 01:15:14,953
the whole damn thing went haywire.

875
01:15:16,595 --> 01:15:18,886
Which explains why I'm feeling so bad.

876
01:15:18,911 --> 01:15:21,208
But Aurora's pod...

877
01:15:24,398 --> 01:15:26,500
You did this.

878
01:15:28,528 --> 01:15:29,570
Yeah.

879
01:15:29,617 --> 01:15:31,904
All this time, I was thinking you're
one lucky son of a bitch

880
01:15:31,929 --> 01:15:34,126
to get stuck with Aurora.

881
01:15:36,924 --> 01:15:39,501
It wasn't luck, was it?

882
01:15:39,526 --> 01:15:40,686
No.

883
01:15:40,711 --> 01:15:42,386
She knows?

884
01:15:42,411 --> 01:15:44,373
She knows.

885
01:15:45,645 --> 01:15:47,392
How long were you alone?

886
01:15:47,417 --> 01:15:49,148
A year.

887
01:15:52,447 --> 01:15:54,255
Still...

888
01:15:55,610 --> 01:15:57,424
Damn.

889
01:16:15,609 --> 01:16:17,452
Same as the rest.

890
01:16:17,932 --> 01:16:20,001
Systems shut downs.

891
01:16:20,026 --> 01:16:22,753
Everywhere, but no apparent connection.

892
01:16:24,280 --> 01:16:26,896
You saw the hibernation pods?

893
01:16:26,974 --> 01:16:28,731
I saw.

894
01:16:30,015 --> 01:16:32,022
So you know.

895
01:16:32,883 --> 01:16:34,853
What Jim did.

896
01:16:36,702 --> 01:16:38,603
Yeah.

897
01:16:39,106 --> 01:16:40,443
And?

898
01:16:40,468 --> 01:16:43,415
- It's not my duty...
- He woke me up!

899
01:16:43,440 --> 01:16:46,209
- He took away my life!
- I know and I'm sorry.

900
01:16:46,234 --> 01:16:49,246
- There's work I have to...
- It's murder!

901
01:16:51,769 --> 01:16:53,354
You're right, Aurora.

902
01:16:53,379 --> 01:16:57,099
But the drowning man always
try to drag someone down with him.

903
01:16:57,137 --> 01:17:00,775
It ain't right,
but the man is drowning.

904
01:17:01,801 --> 01:17:03,928
This one make 16.

905
01:17:06,829 --> 01:17:08,548
Yeah.

906
01:17:11,376 --> 01:17:13,051
You okay?

907
01:17:14,735 --> 01:17:17,421
- You should go rest.
- Yeah.

908
01:17:18,091 --> 01:17:22,892
But just for a couple of hours and then,
back here first thing in the morning.

909
01:18:15,285 --> 01:18:18,201
<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY LOSS</font>

910
01:19:26,112 --> 01:19:27,748
<font color="#ff8080">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

911
01:19:27,773 --> 01:19:28,818
<font color="#80ffff">GRAVITY DRIVE</font>

912
01:20:09,378 --> 01:20:11,216
I was in the pool
when gravity gave out.

913
01:20:11,241 --> 01:20:12,278
Are you okay?

914
01:20:12,303 --> 01:20:13,991
We need to find Gus.

915
01:20:15,385 --> 01:20:17,712
Gus!
Gus!

916
01:20:17,973 --> 01:20:21,263
Gravity loss means that whatever is wrong
we're start to hit the big ticket items.

917
01:20:21,288 --> 01:20:22,958
Not good.

918
01:20:23,537 --> 01:20:28,045
Every failure is a burnout process,
every thing on board is thinking too hard.

919
01:20:28,497 --> 01:20:30,108
Why?

920
01:20:30,674 --> 01:20:33,144
Computer, display these failures over time.

921
01:20:33,169 --> 01:20:35,776
Processing timeline.

922
01:20:36,768 --> 01:20:38,611
Cascades.

923
01:20:39,361 --> 01:20:42,022
It started 2 years ago,
power surge.

924
01:20:42,694 --> 01:20:45,350
17 failures on 1 day.

925
01:20:45,581 --> 01:20:47,902
Including hibernation pod 1498.

926
01:20:47,927 --> 01:20:49,557
That's me.

927
01:20:49,582 --> 01:20:51,259
Woke me up.

928
01:20:52,778 --> 01:20:55,306
- What happened that day?
- Something big.

929
01:20:55,331 --> 01:20:57,814
A major system went down somewhere.

930
01:20:58,180 --> 01:21:00,186
Everything else on board
is trying to pick up the load

931
01:21:00,211 --> 01:21:01,989
but the load's too heavy.

932
01:21:01,990 --> 01:21:04,247
Whatever started this
we got to find it.

933
01:21:04,248 --> 01:21:07,411
- And fix it.
- How bad can this get?

934
01:21:07,964 --> 01:21:10,248
Give me a risk analysis
based on this data.

935
01:21:10,273 --> 01:21:11,928
Extrapolating.

936
01:21:11,953 --> 01:21:14,426
Emission critical failure is imminent.

937
01:21:14,451 --> 01:21:17,775
Failing systems:
Life support. Fusion reactor.

938
01:21:17,800 --> 01:21:19,651
So we're stranded...

939
01:21:19,676 --> 01:21:20,882
Ion drive.

940
01:21:20,907 --> 01:21:23,044
on a sinking ship.

941
01:21:31,196 --> 01:21:33,190
Main Engineering.

942
01:21:33,215 --> 01:21:36,606
Not a lot of things big enough
to hit this ship that hard.

943
01:21:39,103 --> 01:21:42,499
With diagnostics out,
we'll have to find it ourselves.

944
01:21:42,500 --> 01:21:44,377
Where do we start?

945
01:21:44,947 --> 01:21:46,366
Gus!

946
01:21:49,990 --> 01:21:53,498
Scan complete.
Analyzing data.

947
01:21:54,869 --> 01:21:56,750
612 DISORDERS FOUND

948
01:21:56,751 --> 01:21:58,774
What does it say
is wrong with me?

949
01:21:58,799 --> 01:22:00,275
It's a few things.

950
01:22:00,300 --> 01:22:03,328
612 disorders found.

951
01:22:03,353 --> 01:22:05,274
Get me out of here.

952
01:22:19,283 --> 01:22:20,922
What's the prognosis?

953
01:22:20,946 --> 01:22:25,284
Critical diagnosis cannot be discussed
without a doctor or a dentist.

954
01:22:25,309 --> 01:22:29,310
Override on my authority,
I.D. 2317.

955
01:22:29,335 --> 01:22:30,600
Lay it on me, doc.

956
01:22:30,625 --> 01:22:32,547
Pan-systemic necrosis.

957
01:22:32,572 --> 01:22:35,594
Progressive organ failure.
Cause unknown.

958
01:22:35,619 --> 01:22:38,154
My goofy hibernation pod,
that's the cause.

959
01:22:38,179 --> 01:22:41,249
- What's the treatment?
- Various treatment impossible.

960
01:22:41,274 --> 01:22:44,492
None will unmeaningly
extend the patient's life.

961
01:22:47,476 --> 01:22:48,757
How long have I got?

962
01:22:48,782 --> 01:22:52,248
Your end of life transition
is already under way.

963
01:22:52,847 --> 01:22:57,432
These sedatives will alleviate
your suffering during these final hours.

964
01:23:14,498 --> 01:23:16,038
Gus?

965
01:23:20,738 --> 01:23:22,831
I need a minute.

966
01:23:52,044 --> 01:23:54,896
We are experiencing difficulties in flight.

967
01:23:54,921 --> 01:23:57,193
- Gus!
- Gus!

968
01:23:57,218 --> 01:23:58,181
Where can he be?

969
01:23:58,206 --> 01:24:01,601
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

970
01:24:07,805 --> 01:24:11,547
For your own safety,
please return to your cabins.

971
01:24:11,572 --> 01:24:14,303
Shit, the damn pills.

972
01:24:14,304 --> 01:24:16,954
- I'll go get them.
- No, stay.

973
01:24:18,447 --> 01:24:20,163
Sit down.

974
01:24:24,384 --> 01:24:27,118
You two take care of each other.

975
01:24:36,038 --> 01:24:38,341
My I.D..

976
01:24:39,256 --> 01:24:42,262
Get you where you need to go.

977
01:24:42,926 --> 01:24:45,119
Fix the ship.

978
01:24:45,864 --> 01:24:48,488
Find out what's wrong with her.

979
01:24:51,147 --> 01:24:53,176
How do I look?

980
01:24:53,468 --> 01:24:55,936
You look magnificent.

981
01:24:56,490 --> 01:24:59,689
Ladies love a dressed man.

982
01:25:08,067 --> 01:25:10,136
What do we do now?

983
01:25:16,685 --> 01:25:18,398
This can't be good.

984
01:25:21,411 --> 01:25:23,078
I'm going back to Engineering.

985
01:25:23,103 --> 01:25:25,047
Can you fix this?

986
01:25:25,216 --> 01:25:26,900
I need your help.

987
01:25:29,911 --> 01:25:31,408
Let's go!

988
01:25:53,681 --> 01:25:55,092
Arthur!

989
01:26:10,591 --> 01:26:12,011
Let's go!

990
01:26:15,278 --> 01:26:17,385
Main Engineering.

991
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,348
Can't we wake up
some of the crew?

992
01:26:19,373 --> 01:26:21,765
They would take too long to recover,
we don't have that kind of time.

993
01:26:21,790 --> 01:26:23,953
What are we even looking for?

994
01:26:24,150 --> 01:26:26,068
Something broken.

995
01:26:26,336 --> 01:26:27,909
Something big.

996
01:26:28,063 --> 01:26:29,664
Come on!

997
01:26:31,083 --> 01:26:33,399
- Is it broken?
- It seems okay.

998
01:26:33,424 --> 01:26:34,507
What next?

999
01:26:34,532 --> 01:26:36,735
Power Plant.
This way.

1000
01:26:42,502 --> 01:26:44,319
Come on.

1001
01:26:44,496 --> 01:26:46,225
Whole section's closed down.
Something's wrong.

1002
01:26:46,250 --> 01:26:48,041
We're looking for wrong.

1003
01:26:48,066 --> 01:26:49,807
Try to open it.

1004
01:27:01,105 --> 01:27:02,500
Warning.

1005
01:27:02,947 --> 01:27:06,367
Pressure door.
Lock down initiated.

1006
01:27:08,788 --> 01:27:10,524
Please secure all doors.

1007
01:27:10,549 --> 01:27:12,578
Aurora!

1008
01:27:14,460 --> 01:27:17,507
Warning.
Dangerous oxygen level.

1009
01:27:17,532 --> 01:27:19,880
Please secure all doors.

1010
01:27:28,963 --> 01:27:33,345
Dangerous oxygen level.
Please secured all doors.

1011
01:27:37,412 --> 01:27:39,342
Grab it!

1012
01:27:45,592 --> 01:27:48,825
Pressurizing cabin on sensor door.

1013
01:27:57,084 --> 01:27:59,177
Pressure normalized.

1014
01:27:59,749 --> 01:28:01,877
Oxygen level restored.

1015
01:28:01,902 --> 01:28:03,788
Stand lock down.

1016
01:28:03,813 --> 01:28:06,517
A hole in the ship.

1017
01:28:08,486 --> 01:28:10,343
More than one.

1018
01:28:13,335 --> 01:28:15,781
How did that even happen?
This ship is supposed to be meteor-proof.

1019
01:28:15,806 --> 01:28:17,938
I guess one got through.

1020
01:28:25,683 --> 01:28:27,140
It's hot!

1021
01:28:33,766 --> 01:28:35,785
I think we found it.

1022
01:28:45,343 --> 01:28:47,803
It's the reactor control computer.

1023
01:28:53,654 --> 01:28:55,293
This is what hit us 2 years ago.

1024
01:28:55,318 --> 01:28:56,878
Jim.

1025
01:28:57,417 --> 01:28:59,613
How can we fix this?

1026
01:29:02,486 --> 01:29:03,514
We're going to die.

1027
01:29:03,539 --> 01:29:05,737
There's replacement parts for everything.

1028
01:29:10,104 --> 01:29:11,333
Light.

1029
01:29:11,358 --> 01:29:12,769
Sorry.

1030
01:29:14,564 --> 01:29:17,258
As soon as I pull this module,
the entire computer is going to shut down.

1031
01:29:17,283 --> 01:29:19,092
What happens then?

1032
01:29:20,519 --> 01:29:23,089
I'll get it back up
as quickly as I can.

1033
01:29:27,015 --> 01:29:28,549
Hurry!

1034
01:29:30,637 --> 01:29:32,013
Jim!

1035
01:29:34,711 --> 01:29:37,310
Control computer restored.

1036
01:29:38,197 --> 01:29:40,260
Venting reactor.

1037
01:29:42,008 --> 01:29:43,197
But we fixed it!

1038
01:29:43,222 --> 01:29:47,329
Reactor vent failed. 
Manual override required.

1039
01:29:52,679 --> 01:29:54,216
Vent failure.

1040
01:29:54,241 --> 01:29:55,981
- Come on!
- Jim.

1041
01:30:00,302 --> 01:30:02,101
Outer door non-responsive.

1042
01:30:02,127 --> 01:30:04,172
What does that mean?

1043
01:30:05,914 --> 01:30:07,692
The outer door is jammed.

1044
01:30:07,717 --> 01:30:09,576
We got to open that door
and cool the reactor down

1045
01:30:09,608 --> 01:30:11,519
or the whole ship's going to blow.

1046
01:30:11,544 --> 01:30:12,342
How?

1047
01:30:12,367 --> 01:30:13,967
I got to go out there.

1048
01:30:14,008 --> 01:30:16,073
Open it from the outside.

1049
01:30:16,580 --> 01:30:18,991
I open the door
I get cleared.

1050
01:30:19,200 --> 01:30:21,175
You blow that fire into space.

1051
01:30:21,200 --> 01:30:23,805
- You get cleared? 
- You talk to me through this.

1052
01:30:23,806 --> 01:30:26,342
What happens to you
when that door opens?

1053
01:30:36,443 --> 01:30:38,946
Heat shield. 
It might help.

1054
01:30:47,213 --> 01:30:48,829
You might need this.

1055
01:31:02,431 --> 01:31:04,180
It's going to be okay.

1056
01:31:13,750 --> 01:31:15,304
I'm gonna go.

1057
01:31:20,161 --> 01:31:21,606
Jim.

1058
01:31:21,965 --> 01:31:23,448
Jim.

1059
01:31:25,831 --> 01:31:27,561
Come back to me.

1060
01:31:29,103 --> 01:31:31,717
I can't live on the ship 
without you.

1061
01:31:56,859 --> 01:31:59,475
Warning.
Temperature critical.

1062
01:31:59,500 --> 01:32:00,861
AHHHH!

1063
01:32:12,770 --> 01:32:14,318
What's wrong?

1064
01:32:15,113 --> 01:32:16,936
What's the matter?
Are you okay?

1065
01:32:16,963 --> 01:32:18,469
Nothing.
Go.

1066
01:32:18,494 --> 01:32:19,424
You sure?

1067
01:32:19,449 --> 01:32:20,845
Yeah.

1068
01:32:28,388 --> 01:32:30,196
I'm in the vent tube.

1069
01:32:31,044 --> 01:32:34,040
New anchor port. 
Reset tail.

1070
01:32:37,308 --> 01:32:38,958
I see the door.

1071
01:32:39,531 --> 01:32:41,952
Temperature level rising.

1072
01:32:48,683 --> 01:32:51,613
Warning.
Temperature critical.

1073
01:32:57,449 --> 01:32:59,967
Containment unstable.

1074
01:33:01,103 --> 01:33:02,289
Where are you?

1075
01:33:02,314 --> 01:33:03,392
I'm at the door.

1076
01:33:03,417 --> 01:33:05,041
I'm ready, just say when.

1077
01:33:05,066 --> 01:33:06,714
There goes.

1078
01:33:09,657 --> 01:33:12,710
The door won't open. 
I'll have to bypass it.

1079
01:33:14,699 --> 01:33:17,181
Temperature level rising.

1080
01:33:17,804 --> 01:33:19,137
Jim, come on!

1081
01:33:19,162 --> 01:33:20,904
Please, hurry!

1082
01:33:20,929 --> 01:33:24,070
- Okay, I'm trying it again. 
- Tell me when you're cleared.

1083
01:33:28,068 --> 01:33:28,760
No!

1084
01:33:28,785 --> 01:33:30,046
What?

1085
01:33:30,844 --> 01:33:32,565
What's going on?

1086
01:33:32,736 --> 01:33:34,232
Jim?

1087
01:33:38,318 --> 01:33:39,370
Jim!

1088
01:33:39,395 --> 01:33:41,523
The door won't stay open.

1089
01:33:42,515 --> 01:33:46,326
I think I have to stay here, 
hold the door open.

1090
01:33:47,099 --> 01:33:48,378
No!

1091
01:33:48,403 --> 01:33:49,912
No way, get out of there!

1092
01:33:49,937 --> 01:33:51,504
I can't.

1093
01:33:51,654 --> 01:33:53,164
Jim...

1094
01:33:53,271 --> 01:33:55,097
We're out of time.

1095
01:33:56,248 --> 01:33:57,950
Containment unstable.

1096
01:33:57,990 --> 01:33:59,523
Jim?

1097
01:34:05,635 --> 01:34:07,550
Vent the reactor.

1098
01:34:13,420 --> 01:34:16,319
No, you don't understand!

1099
01:34:16,636 --> 01:34:19,390
If I open the right now
it will kill you!

1100
01:34:19,416 --> 01:34:20,577
I'm opening it up.

1101
01:34:20,602 --> 01:34:22,478
Come back in, 
we'll think of something else.

1102
01:34:22,503 --> 01:34:24,425
There is nothing else.

1103
01:34:25,599 --> 01:34:27,062
Jim!

1104
01:34:27,646 --> 01:34:29,460
- It's okay. 
- No, it's not okay!

1105
01:34:29,485 --> 01:34:32,693
- Aurora
- Warning. Temperature critical.

1106
01:34:32,718 --> 01:34:35,272
This is not how it's suppose to happen!

1107
01:34:36,004 --> 01:34:37,454
Aurora, this ship is going to go.

1108
01:34:37,479 --> 01:34:40,089
I don't care!
You die, I die.

1109
01:34:40,365 --> 01:34:43,584
There are 5,000 other people 
on this ship, Aurora.

1110
01:34:44,722 --> 01:34:46,681
We have to do this.

1111
01:34:47,251 --> 01:34:49,461
Maximum pressure reached.

1112
01:34:52,751 --> 01:34:55,206
Do it. 
Now.

1113
01:34:56,030 --> 01:34:58,696
Maximum cabin pressure reached.

1114
01:35:19,737 --> 01:35:21,853
Temperature dropping.

1115
01:35:23,233 --> 01:35:24,615
Jim.

1116
01:35:42,651 --> 01:35:44,793
- Jim.
- Vent successful.

1117
01:35:44,793 --> 01:35:47,147
Rebooting process initiated.

1118
01:35:47,172 --> 01:35:49,365
Jim, please say something.

1119
01:36:25,784 --> 01:36:28,285
Suit pressure dropping.

1120
01:36:30,834 --> 01:36:34,003
Return to ship immediately.

1121
01:36:35,025 --> 01:36:36,471
Aurora.

1122
01:36:37,995 --> 01:36:39,232
It worked!

1123
01:36:39,257 --> 01:36:41,393
You did it, you can come in!

1124
01:36:41,567 --> 01:36:43,169
Yeah, about that...

1125
01:36:43,194 --> 01:36:44,956
What's the matter?
Are you hurt?

1126
01:36:45,637 --> 01:36:47,500
I got blown out of the tube.

1127
01:36:47,524 --> 01:36:48,404
What?

1128
01:36:48,430 --> 01:36:51,303
My tail broke.
I can't get back to the ship.

1129
01:36:52,059 --> 01:36:54,072
I'll come out. I'll come out.
I'll pull you in.

1130
01:36:54,097 --> 01:36:56,959
Warning.
Oxygen level critical.

1131
01:36:56,984 --> 01:36:59,833
Return to ship immediately.

1132
01:37:07,717 --> 01:37:10,582
Aurora, I'm sorry...

1133
01:37:12,274 --> 01:37:13,516
... for everything.

1134
01:37:13,541 --> 01:37:15,374
Shut up, I'm coming.

1135
01:37:15,779 --> 01:37:20,508
I wish we'd have met 
in 90 years.

1136
01:37:25,176 --> 01:37:28,803
I...
I'd build you a house.

1137
01:37:32,969 --> 01:37:35,187
I'll read your book.

1138
01:37:37,423 --> 01:37:39,306
It's a good feel.

1139
01:37:51,541 --> 01:37:52,792
Tail attached.

1140
01:37:52,817 --> 01:37:55,006
Locate Jim Preston.

1141
01:37:59,155 --> 01:38:02,168
Jim Preston, located.

1142
01:38:02,738 --> 01:38:04,502
I'm going to get you.

1143
01:38:29,062 --> 01:38:30,663
JIM!

1144
01:39:30,337 --> 01:39:32,740
I'm sorry. 
The patient is dead.

1145
01:39:32,765 --> 01:39:34,222
WELL, RESUSCITATE HIM!

1146
01:39:34,247 --> 01:39:37,751
Postmortem operations require 
authorized medical supervision.

1147
01:39:37,776 --> 01:39:39,453
No!

1148
01:39:47,820 --> 01:39:50,067
Override!
Override on my authority!

1149
01:39:50,092 --> 01:39:53,625
I.D. 17...

1150

1151
01:39:56,707 --> 01:39:58,464
2...

1152
01:40:00,069 --> 01:40:02,938
2317!
I.D. 2317!

1155
01:40:10,816 --> 01:40:12,641
Multiple procedures are not recommended.

1156
01:40:12,666 --> 01:40:14,185
OVERRIDE!

1157
01:40:14,210 --> 01:40:15,849
DO IT, NOW!

1158
01:40:15,874 --> 01:40:17,525
Executing

1159
01:41:16,760 --> 01:41:18,037
Jim.

1160
01:41:20,110 --> 01:41:21,632
Jim.

1161
01:41:49,339 --> 01:41:51,652
You brought me back.

1162
01:41:51,708 --> 01:41:53,300
Yeah.

1163
01:42:17,173 --> 01:42:18,014
Thank you.

1164
01:42:18,015 --> 01:42:19,428
Be still.

1165
01:42:19,453 --> 01:42:21,063
Of course.

1166
01:43:06,020 --> 01:43:08,220
There's something I have to show you.

1167
01:43:08,245 --> 01:43:11,422
In Command mode, it turns out 
the autodoc has a option

1168
01:43:11,447 --> 01:43:13,925
called "Stabilize and Suspend".

1169
01:43:13,950 --> 01:43:16,796
It stops all metabolic activity.

1170
01:43:18,476 --> 01:43:19,709
What are you saying?

1171
01:43:19,734 --> 01:43:22,253
It's ​​Gus' idea. 
It could be like hibernation.

1172
01:43:22,278 --> 01:43:25,195
Inside the autodoc,
you can go back to sleep.

1173
01:43:29,450 --> 01:43:31,658
But there's only one autodoc.

1174
01:43:35,656 --> 01:43:37,065
Yeah.

1175
01:43:39,214 --> 01:43:41,649
And you're going to 
lay down in it,

1176
01:43:41,759 --> 01:43:43,550
and fall asleep.

1177
01:43:44,334 --> 01:43:46,603
And you'll wake up on Homestead II,

1178
01:43:46,628 --> 01:43:48,652
and you'll write you book.

1179
01:43:50,077 --> 01:43:53,429
You finish your journey.
You do what you set out to do.

1180
01:44:01,732 --> 01:44:03,705
You'll be alone.

1181
01:44:04,777 --> 01:44:08,829
I've been alone before
and I'll be fine.

1182
01:44:09,978 --> 01:44:12,338
But I'll never see you again.

1183
01:44:15,463 --> 01:44:17,350
I'll come and visit you.

1184
01:44:59,969 --> 01:45:02,496
Tuesday is my day with Arthur.

1185
01:45:03,917 --> 01:45:05,576
Lovely as ever.

1186
01:45:05,601 --> 01:45:07,928
Thank you, Arthur. 
You're looking very well yourself.

1187
01:45:07,953 --> 01:45:09,725
Thanks to you.

1188
01:45:10,716 --> 01:45:12,211
What's that?

1189
01:45:14,312 --> 01:45:17,307
Something I wanted to 
give you for a long time.

1190
01:45:23,628 --> 01:45:25,658
It's beautiful.

1191
01:45:38,141 --> 01:45:40,947
Took you long enough to ask.

1192
01:45:43,586 --> 01:45:46,976
Champagne. 
I'll wait.

1193
01:46:03,722 --> 01:46:05,603
Hell of a life.

1194
01:46:08,118 --> 01:46:10,012
Hell of a life.

1195
01:46:28,267 --> 01:46:32,280
HOMESTEAD II

1196
01:46:32,305 --> 01:46:39,134
HOMESTEAD II
88 YEARS LATER

1197
01:46:40,945 --> 01:46:44,331
Crew wake up process initiated.

1198
01:46:45,012 --> 01:46:47,034
My fellow passengers,

1199
01:46:47,059 --> 01:46:52,373
if you are reading this, then the 
starship Avalon has reached its destination.

1200
01:46:52,398 --> 01:46:54,506
Grand Concourse.

1201
01:46:54,691 --> 01:46:57,108
A lot happened while you slept.

1202
01:47:04,229 --> 01:47:06,082
A friend once said,

1203
01:47:06,107 --> 01:47:09,363
"You can't get so hung up
on where you'd rather be

1204
01:47:09,388 --> 01:47:12,939
that you forget to make
the most of where you are.

1205
01:47:13,490 --> 01:47:15,953
We got lost on our way.

1206
01:47:16,505 --> 01:47:18,511
We found each other.

1207
01:47:18,845 --> 01:47:20,683
And we made a life.

1208
01:47:20,708 --> 01:47:24,911
A beautiful life... together.
