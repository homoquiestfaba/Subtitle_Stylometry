1
00:00:00,057 --> 00:00:01,639
Previously on Cedar Cove... 

2
00:00:01,642 --> 00:00:02,591
I can't stop thinking about you.

3
00:00:02,725 --> 00:00:03,826
You are a married man.

4
00:00:03,944 --> 00:00:04,844
You seem familiar with his work.

5
00:00:04,995 --> 00:00:06,462
Yes. I'm... I'm a big fan.

6
00:00:06,596 --> 00:00:09,115
I know that you want to see
if Olivia will take you back.

7
00:00:09,265 --> 00:00:10,366
And you're gonna go to Philadelphia?

8
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,901
Yeah. Just for a couple of days.

9
00:00:12,035 --> 00:00:14,470
[Olivia]: But what if
he offers you the job?

10
00:00:21,111 --> 00:00:22,478
[Relieved sigh]

11
00:00:23,580 --> 00:00:24,830
Hey.

12
00:00:24,981 --> 00:00:26,348
Hey!

13
00:00:26,466 --> 00:00:27,749
There he is.

14
00:00:27,884 --> 00:00:30,319
So? Talk to me. How'd it go?

15
00:00:30,454 --> 00:00:31,487
[Exhales]

16
00:00:31,621 --> 00:00:33,305
It went... 

17
00:00:33,456 --> 00:00:35,724
well.

18
00:00:35,949 --> 00:00:38,651
Exceedingly well.

19
00:00:38,785 --> 00:00:40,753
They offered you a job?

20
00:00:40,887 --> 00:00:42,521
They did.

21
00:00:42,639 --> 00:00:43,755
[Claps] Yes!

22
00:00:43,890 --> 00:00:45,757
I will have a cranberry soda, please.

23
00:00:45,892 --> 00:00:47,693
And I'll have another, please.

24
00:00:47,811 --> 00:00:49,495
Thank you.

25
00:00:49,629 --> 00:00:51,230
Wow.

26
00:00:51,348 --> 00:00:52,464
That's great, man!

27
00:00:52,599 --> 00:00:54,132
Full-time assignment,

28
00:00:54,267 --> 00:00:56,285
covering major league baseball.

29
00:00:56,436 --> 00:00:57,670
Y... you're kidding me, right?

30
00:00:57,787 --> 00:00:58,971
The Phillies?

31
00:00:59,089 --> 00:01:01,140
Hot-stove league, spring training,

32
00:01:01,274 --> 00:01:02,507
regular season coverage,

33
00:01:02,642 --> 00:01:04,710
traveling with the team for all away games.

34
00:01:04,828 --> 00:01:06,495
You know, I'm so happy for
you. You deserve it, man.

35
00:01:06,630 --> 00:01:08,280
You know, you've really
turned your life around.

36
00:01:08,415 --> 00:01:09,881
Thank you.

37
00:01:10,016 --> 00:01:11,901
Listen, Mike, you really, uh,

38
00:01:12,051 --> 00:01:13,819
you came through for me, man.

39
00:01:13,937 --> 00:01:14,837
I owe you.

40
00:01:14,988 --> 00:01:16,788
Yes, you do!

41
00:01:16,923 --> 00:01:19,308
And you can start with, uh, season tickets,

42
00:01:19,459 --> 00:01:21,143
third-base line, behind the dugout.

43
00:01:21,278 --> 00:01:22,228
Mm-hmm.

44
00:01:22,362 --> 00:01:23,729
So when do you start?

45
00:01:26,032 --> 00:01:27,383
What? What's the problem?

46
00:01:27,517 --> 00:01:29,735
I told them that I need to think it over.

47
00:01:29,853 --> 00:01:31,270
This is your dream job.

48
00:01:31,404 --> 00:01:33,238
Yeah.

49
00:01:33,373 --> 00:01:34,757
But it's also a full-time job.

50
00:01:34,907 --> 00:01:36,775
So?

51
00:01:36,893 --> 00:01:39,995
So... I would have to move back here.

52
00:01:40,146 --> 00:01:42,481
Jack, you're currently living in a town

53
00:01:42,616 --> 00:01:44,216
that's not even on the map.

54
00:01:44,351 --> 00:01:45,884
You're writing stories about bake sales

55
00:01:46,019 --> 00:01:47,519
and community theater productions.

56
00:01:47,654 --> 00:01:48,904
I mean... dude.

57
00:01:49,039 --> 00:01:51,624
This isn't just any big
city sports-writing gig.

58
00:01:51,758 --> 00:01:53,425
This... this is the Phillies.

59
00:01:53,560 --> 00:01:54,443
I know.

60
00:01:54,594 --> 00:01:55,561
You know?

61
00:01:55,695 --> 00:01:56,595
Okay, well, if you know,

62
00:01:56,730 --> 00:01:58,364
then what's holding you back?

63
00:01:58,531 --> 00:02:00,916
[**]

64
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,520
[Knocking]

65
00:02:04,671 --> 00:02:06,555
Hey, Stan. What are you doing here?

66
00:02:06,690 --> 00:02:08,340
I need to talk to you.

67
00:02:08,475 --> 00:02:09,458
Okay.

68
00:02:09,609 --> 00:02:10,876
I know Melanie came to see you.

69
00:02:10,994 --> 00:02:13,412
Yeah, I think she's gotten
the wrong idea about us.

70
00:02:13,546 --> 00:02:14,647
Yeah, well.

71
00:02:14,781 --> 00:02:16,298
She's always felt threatened by you.

72
00:02:16,449 --> 00:02:18,083
I'm sorry, Stan, really.

73
00:02:18,218 --> 00:02:19,051
Oh, don't be.

74
00:02:19,185 --> 00:02:20,252
It's not your problem.

75
00:02:20,387 --> 00:02:23,222
It's hers. Or ours.

76
00:02:23,356 --> 00:02:25,658
Which is why I've made a decision,

77
00:02:25,792 --> 00:02:27,226
I'm moving out.

78
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:29,094
I'm ready for a new beginning.

79
00:02:29,229 --> 00:02:30,596
Moving out?

80
00:02:30,730 --> 00:02:32,281
What are you talking about? A divorce?

81
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:34,867
Contacted my lawyer to start the process.

82
00:02:35,001 --> 00:02:36,869
So you're gonna run out on her now?

83
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:38,137
Oh, come on, Olivia.

84
00:02:38,271 --> 00:02:40,155
I've tried to make it
work. You know I have.

85
00:02:40,306 --> 00:02:42,825
But she won't accept me spending time here,

86
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,876
not even with Justine.

87
00:02:43,994 --> 00:02:45,377
I can't go on like that.

88
00:02:45,495 --> 00:02:46,979
Would you move back to Cedar Cove?

89
00:02:47,113 --> 00:02:48,297
It doesn't have to be Cedar Cove.

90
00:02:48,431 --> 00:02:49,915
I could move to Lakewood,

91
00:02:50,050 --> 00:02:52,451
or Cooperton.

92
00:02:52,585 --> 00:02:56,188
You don't think me moving
here is a good idea.

93
00:02:56,323 --> 00:02:57,356
I didn't say that.

94
00:02:57,490 --> 00:02:59,124
You didn't have to.

95
00:02:59,259 --> 00:03:00,859
We were married a long time.

96
00:03:00,994 --> 00:03:02,261
I can see it in your eyes.

97
00:03:02,395 --> 00:03:06,932
Your moving back impacts
more than just Justine.

98
00:03:07,067 --> 00:03:08,984
I know.

99
00:03:09,135 --> 00:03:12,404
And I won't do it, if you don't want me to.

100
00:03:14,407 --> 00:03:16,909
I'm staying at the Thyme and Tide for now.

101
00:03:17,043 --> 00:03:18,127
I won't make any decisions

102
00:03:18,277 --> 00:03:20,829
until you've had a chance to think it over.

103
00:03:23,249 --> 00:03:25,718

00:03:57,634 --> 00:03:59,525
She was John's mother?

106
00:03:59,683 --> 00:04:01,748
I don't know. I think so.

107
00:04:01,955 --> 00:04:03,072
Her email address said "Kirkland",

108
00:04:03,206 --> 00:04:04,623
which was the name I saw

109
00:04:04,741 --> 00:04:06,058
on all those unopened
letters in his apartment.

110
00:04:06,193 --> 00:04:08,978
You think his real name is Kirkland,

111
00:04:09,128 --> 00:04:10,262
and he changed it to Bowman?

112
00:04:10,397 --> 00:04:11,580
Why would he do that?

113
00:04:11,731 --> 00:04:12,865
That's what I wanted to find out,

114
00:04:12,999 --> 00:04:14,266
but he wouldn't tell me.

115
00:04:14,401 --> 00:04:16,602
So what're you going to do?

116
00:04:16,736 --> 00:04:18,521
I'm going to have to find out on my own.

117
00:04:18,672 --> 00:04:20,706
He's not going to like that.

118
00:04:20,824 --> 00:04:23,592
Oh, probably not,

119
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:25,561
but I need to know his story.

120
00:04:25,695 --> 00:04:27,446
I've had enough of the mystery.

121
00:04:27,581 --> 00:04:29,114
Well, when you're done,

122
00:04:29,249 --> 00:04:30,883
maybe you can help me
unravel a mystery of my own.

123
00:04:31,017 --> 00:04:32,518
Still no word from Seth?

124
00:04:32,652 --> 00:04:35,087
Nothing.

125
00:04:35,205 --> 00:04:38,390
He probably just took that
fishing job up in Alaska.

126
00:04:38,508 --> 00:04:40,759
I called the fishery.

127
00:04:40,894 --> 00:04:42,077
He never showed up.

128
00:04:42,228 --> 00:04:44,163
Maybe he got a better
offer from another company.

129
00:04:44,297 --> 00:04:45,264
Then where's his boat?

130
00:04:45,398 --> 00:04:46,932
If he took a fishing job in Alaska,

131
00:04:47,067 --> 00:04:48,684
his boat would still be at the marina,

132
00:04:48,818 --> 00:04:49,935
and it's gone.

133
00:04:51,137 --> 00:04:52,905
I have no idea where he went.

That would be me.

142
00:05:13,643 --> 00:05:14,476
Welcome home.

143
00:05:14,611 --> 00:05:15,894
Aw!

144
00:05:16,029 --> 00:05:17,696
Mm-mm!

145
00:05:17,814 --> 00:05:19,064
How was Philadelphia?

146
00:05:19,199 --> 00:05:22,334
Loud, crowded and in a big, big rush.

147
00:05:22,469 --> 00:05:24,903
Hey. I got you something.

148
00:05:26,339 --> 00:05:27,740
Ta-dah!

149
00:05:27,874 --> 00:05:28,874
Does that mean you got the job?

150
00:05:29,009 --> 00:05:31,477
No! No. Just something from the airport.

151
00:05:31,611 --> 00:05:33,028
Oh, how romantic.

152
00:05:33,163 --> 00:05:34,163
[Laughs] Here.

153
00:05:34,314 --> 00:05:35,547
How was the interview?

154
00:05:35,682 --> 00:05:38,300
Oh, I think it went well.

155
00:05:38,435 --> 00:05:40,636
They seem to really, really like me.

156
00:05:40,770 --> 00:05:43,238
Good.

157
00:05:43,389 --> 00:05:44,940
Don't keep me in suspense.

158
00:05:45,075 --> 00:05:47,242
Did you get the job or not?

159
00:05:47,377 --> 00:05:48,577
I don't know.

160
00:05:48,712 --> 00:05:51,013
I guess we're just gonna
have to wait and see.

161
00:05:51,164 --> 00:05:53,215
Are you okay?

162
00:05:53,350 --> 00:05:54,333
Yeah, yeah.

163
00:05:54,467 --> 00:05:56,018
Come on. Let me take you to lunch.

164
00:05:56,152 --> 00:05:58,354
That sounds great.

165
00:06:00,273 --> 00:06:02,041
Why are you going to Tacoma?

166
00:06:02,175 --> 00:06:03,225
I need to talk to the manager

167
00:06:03,376 --> 00:06:04,476
of the restaurant John used to work at.

168
00:06:04,611 --> 00:06:06,111
- Yeah, but I thought you already did that.
- On the phone.

169
00:06:06,246 --> 00:06:08,414
But maybe I can pull more out of him

170
00:06:08,531 --> 00:06:09,815
if I go see him face-to-face.

171
00:06:09,949 --> 00:06:11,216
Mm, I don't think I like this.

172
00:06:11,351 --> 00:06:12,868
I'll be fine.

173
00:06:13,019 --> 00:06:14,203
Drink your tea. It's calming.

174
00:06:14,337 --> 00:06:15,888
I am very calm, thank you. Come here.

175
00:06:17,724 --> 00:06:19,658
You do not need to worry about me, okay?

176
00:06:19,793 --> 00:06:20,726
I can't help it.

177
00:06:20,860 --> 00:06:22,194
You haven't been yourself lately.

178
00:06:22,329 --> 00:06:23,796
I'm just tired.

179
00:06:23,913 --> 00:06:25,164
He's not still texting you, is he?

180
00:06:27,067 --> 00:06:29,068
When is this guy going to leave town?

181
00:06:29,202 --> 00:06:30,569
- In a few days.
- Good.

182
00:06:30,704 --> 00:06:33,505
Just hang in there
and ignore the texts,

183
00:06:33,640 --> 00:06:35,006
then he'll be gone,

184
00:06:35,141 --> 00:06:36,405
and you never have to think
about Will Jeffers again.

185
00:06:36,429 --> 00:06:37,897
I've been torturing myself,

186
00:06:38,031 --> 00:06:39,431
wondering if he's been lying to me,

187
00:06:39,566 --> 00:06:40,766
or he's been lying to Olivia,

188
00:06:40,901 --> 00:06:42,084
and then I realized it doesn't matter,

189
00:06:42,235 --> 00:06:44,336
- because either way, he is a liar.
- Exactly.

190
00:06:44,471 --> 00:06:46,689
And he doesn't deserve
any more of your time.

191
00:06:46,839 --> 00:06:48,491
Just wait it out,

192
00:06:48,641 --> 00:06:50,272
and soon, everything will be
back to normal. You'll see.

193
00:06:54,014 --> 00:06:56,348
You need to lay down a coat of liquid epoxy

194
00:06:56,483 --> 00:06:58,617
to seal the wood and fill in the cracks.

195
00:06:58,752 --> 00:07:00,920
Bob, what are you talking
about? I already did that. Look.

196
00:07:01,037 --> 00:07:01,987
You're gonna have to do it again.

197
00:07:02,122 --> 00:07:03,455
There's cracks showing. Right here.

198
00:07:03,590 --> 00:07:05,407
- Where?
- Right there.

199
00:07:05,558 --> 00:07:07,059
You need a solid ship, Jack,

200
00:07:07,194 --> 00:07:08,727
or there's no sense
putting 'er in the water.

201
00:07:10,130 --> 00:07:12,698
The sea has a way of finding your mistakes.

202
00:07:12,832 --> 00:07:14,333
[Jack grumbles]: Argh. Fine.

203
00:07:15,936 --> 00:07:17,203
So what's the rush anyway?

204
00:07:17,337 --> 00:07:21,073
I mean, it's obvious you're in
a big hurry to build this canoe.

205
00:07:21,208 --> 00:07:23,342
Is there someplace else you've got to be?

206
00:07:23,476 --> 00:07:25,511
Now, why would you be asking me that?

207
00:07:25,645 --> 00:07:27,146
Oh, I don't know.

208
00:07:27,280 --> 00:07:28,881
Word on the street has it

209
00:07:28,999 --> 00:07:30,916
you went to Philly for a job interview.

210
00:07:31,051 --> 00:07:32,801
"Word on the street"?

211
00:07:32,936 --> 00:07:34,019
Charlotte.

212
00:07:34,154 --> 00:07:35,738
Ahh.

213
00:07:35,888 --> 00:07:36,739
How'd it go?

214

[Sighing deeply]

215
00:07:38,091 --> 00:07:39,542
Come on!

216
00:07:39,676 --> 00:07:41,393
Good.

217
00:07:41,511 --> 00:07:43,012
They offered it to you, didn't they?

218
00:07:44,831 --> 00:07:46,081
Are you gonna take it?

219
00:07:46,232 --> 00:07:47,750
You know, Bob, there was a time in my life

220
00:07:47,884 --> 00:07:49,768
when I wouldn't have
thought twice about it,

221
00:07:49,886 --> 00:07:51,837
but, um... 

222
00:07:51,972 --> 00:07:53,405
I lost everything once,

223
00:07:53,540 --> 00:07:56,208
and I'm just not gonna
let that happen again.

224
00:07:56,343 --> 00:07:57,610
I hear you.

225
00:07:57,744 --> 00:07:59,144
I've been there.

226
00:07:59,262 --> 00:08:00,446
Priorities, right?

227
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:02,181
Priorities.

228
00:08:02,315 --> 00:08:05,617
I'm just not going to let
work come before my sobriety

229
00:08:05,752 --> 00:08:07,386
and everything else in my life.

230
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:10,089
And by "everything else" you mean Olivia?

231
00:08:12,425 --> 00:08:15,477
I finally got a voice-mail from Seth today.

232
00:08:15,628 --> 00:08:18,230
That's good. What'd he say?

233
00:08:18,365 --> 00:08:19,398
Not much.

234
00:08:19,532 --> 00:08:20,950
Just that he was sorry

235
00:08:21,084 --> 00:08:23,369
and he has "a plan" in the works.

236
00:08:23,503 --> 00:08:26,338
Something that will benefit the both of us.

237
00:08:26,473 --> 00:08:27,873
What plan?

238
00:08:28,008 --> 00:08:29,074
I don't know.

239
00:08:29,192 --> 00:08:31,060
He didn't say.

240
00:08:31,194 --> 00:08:32,895
He just said to be patient.

241
00:08:33,029 --> 00:08:35,247
Mm, I can relate to that.

242
00:08:35,382 --> 00:08:37,333
I'm kind of going through
the same thing right now.

243
00:08:37,467 --> 00:08:38,834
- With Jack?
- Yeah.

244
00:08:38,985 --> 00:08:40,886
You know, this whole
thing with Philadelphia.

245
00:08:41,021 --> 00:08:42,688
I don't know how that's gonna play out.

246
00:08:42,822 --> 00:08:44,290
You're worried that
he's gonna go back there?

247
00:08:44,424 --> 00:08:45,874
Of course.

248
00:08:46,009 --> 00:08:47,176
And even if he doesn't,

249
00:08:47,310 --> 00:08:48,727
what's the next thing that'll come along

250
00:08:48,862 --> 00:08:50,529
and take him away at a moment's notice?

251
00:08:50,647 --> 00:08:52,531
The not-knowing... 

252
00:08:52,666 --> 00:08:53,949
it's not fun.

253
00:08:54,084 --> 00:08:55,534
No, it isn't.

254
00:08:55,669 --> 00:08:57,669
Did Seth say where he was?

255
00:08:57,804 --> 00:08:58,887
No.

256
00:08:59,022 --> 00:09:00,656
Well, at least you know he's safe.

257
00:09:02,575 --> 00:09:04,159
Part of me wonders if
it's all even worth it.

00:09:09,633 --> 00:09:12,034
Hello?

00:09:12,185 --> 00:09:13,702
Hi, Stan.

261
00:09:13,853 --> 00:09:14,920
Yeah, she's right here.

262
00:09:16,790 --> 00:09:17,690
Meet you where?

263

Right now?

264
00:09:21,344 --> 00:09:22,478
Hey!

265
00:09:22,612 --> 00:09:24,313
You bought a boat?

266
00:09:24,447 --> 00:09:25,748
That's just like the one we used to have.

267
00:09:25,898 --> 00:09:27,383
Come on board and we'll
go for a little spin.

268
00:09:27,533 --> 00:09:28,767
I don't think so.

269
00:09:28,885 --> 00:09:31,470
Oh, come on! You loved our boat.

270
00:09:31,604 --> 00:09:32,354
You did, too.

271
00:09:32,489 --> 00:09:34,406
Yeah, we all did.

272
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:35,774
Come on. Just a quick
ride out to the point.

273
00:09:35,909 --> 00:09:37,543
It could be fun.

274
00:09:37,661 --> 00:09:38,577
I don't know, you guys.

275
00:09:38,712 --> 00:09:40,129
Come on, mom.

276
00:09:40,263 --> 00:09:41,180
One little spin.

277
00:09:41,314 --> 00:09:44,483
[Laughs] Oh, alright.

278
00:09:44,601 --> 00:09:47,269
Justine, can you get the lines?

279
00:09:47,404 --> 00:09:49,071
There we go.

Can I help you?

284
00:10:12,595 --> 00:10:13,512
Yes.

285
00:10:13,526 --> 00:10:16,245
Hi. I'm Maryellen Sherman.

286
00:10:16,379 --> 00:10:18,163
We spoke on the phone awhile back.

287
00:10:18,298 --> 00:10:20,933
Lady, I talk to about 50
people on the phone every day.

288
00:10:21,051 --> 00:10:22,384
Right. Of course.

289
00:10:22,519 --> 00:10:25,304
I called you about one
of your former chefs,

290
00:10:25,438 --> 00:10:26,572
John Bowman.

291
00:10:26,706 --> 00:10:27,873
Yeah.

292
00:10:28,008 --> 00:10:29,642
I asked you why you fired him,

293
00:10:29,776 --> 00:10:30,709
you said he lied on his application.

294
00:10:30,844 --> 00:10:32,111
That's right.

295
00:10:32,245 --> 00:10:34,146
But you wouldn't tell
me what he lied about.

296
00:10:34,281 --> 00:10:35,648
You said "ask John."

297
00:10:35,782 --> 00:10:36,949
- And did you?
- Yes.

298
00:10:37,083 --> 00:10:39,918
But he wouldn't tell me either.

299
00:10:40,053 --> 00:10:41,020
Yeah, that figures.

300
00:10:41,154 --> 00:10:43,289
Tough break. Excuse me.

301
00:10:43,406 --> 00:10:44,290
Look.

00:10:44,407 --> 00:10:46,825
The reason I called... 

303
00:10:46,960 --> 00:10:48,711
I'm opening up a restaurant in Cedar Cove

304
00:10:48,861 --> 00:10:50,579
and I'm thinking about hiring John.

305
00:10:50,714 --> 00:10:51,697
He's an incredible chef.

306
00:10:51,831 --> 00:10:53,215
Yeah, he is.

307
00:10:53,366 --> 00:10:54,583
Best I've ever worked with.

00:10:54,718 --> 00:10:56,251

310

he's not telling me.

I should be worried about with this guy.

One of the questions on
our job application asks

316

if you've ever been convicted of a felony.

317
00:11:18,891 --> 00:11:19,942
He answered "no."

318

00:11:21,995 --> 00:11:23,278
Yeah.

No.

00:13:54,141 --> 00:13:56,560
I went to the fire water grill.

369
00:13:58,079 --> 00:13:59,863
Is it true?

370
00:13:59,997 --> 00:14:01,881
Were you really in prison?

371
00:14:04,518 --> 00:14:05,418
Yes.

372
00:14:05,553 --> 00:14:07,671
Why?

373
00:14:14,528 --> 00:14:15,662
It was a drug charge.

374
00:14:17,582 --> 00:14:18,848
What happened?

375
00:14:18,999 --> 00:14:21,601
It doesn't matter.

376
00:14:21,736 --> 00:14:23,203
It happened.

377
00:14:23,321 --> 00:14:24,588
Why didn't you tell me?

378
00:14:24,738 --> 00:14:27,173
Because it's not something
I'm proud of. Okay?

379
00:14:27,308 --> 00:14:29,709
I don't walk around bragging
about a thing like that.

380
00:14:29,844 --> 00:14:31,978
I still deserve to know.

381
00:14:33,714 --> 00:14:35,048
What else have you been keeping from me?

382
00:14:36,884 --> 00:14:38,184
Nothing.

383
00:14:38,319 --> 00:14:39,903
Because I need to know
if there's anything else

384
00:14:40,037 --> 00:14:42,289
you're not telling me.

385
00:14:42,423 --> 00:14:43,373
I'm sorry.

386
00:14:43,507 --> 00:14:44,841
- John... 
- I really am sorry.

387
00:14:44,976 --> 00:14:46,259
I can't be here right now.

388
00:14:46,394 --> 00:14:48,128
You can't just walk out in
the middle of your shift!

389
00:14:52,133 --> 00:14:55,034
[Buffer whirring]

390
00:14:58,105 --> 00:15:00,106
[Buffer powers down]

391
00:15:00,241 --> 00:15:01,791
Wow... 

392
00:15:01,942 --> 00:15:03,143
I'm impressed.

393
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,978
It's gorgeous!

394
00:15:05,096 --> 00:15:07,814
Yeah, it's getting there, isn't it?

395
00:15:07,932 --> 00:15:09,683
Hey.

396
00:15:09,817 --> 00:15:11,201
I stopped by your place earlier.

397
00:15:11,335 --> 00:15:13,870
Something I wanted to tell you in person.

398
00:15:14,005 --> 00:15:16,456
Yeah, I had some things I had to do.

399
00:15:16,590 --> 00:15:18,892
I just wanted to tell you that, uh... 

400
00:15:19,026 --> 00:15:21,527
They did offer me that job.

401
00:15:21,662 --> 00:15:24,931
Full-time sportswriter,
covering the Phillies.

402
00:15:25,066 --> 00:15:25,965
Full-time?

403
00:15:27,401 --> 00:15:28,735
I turned it down.

404
00:15:28,869 --> 00:15:32,539
What?

405
00:15:32,673 --> 00:15:34,357
Jack... that's your dream job.

406
00:15:34,492 --> 00:15:35,475
Yeah, it is.

407
00:15:35,609 --> 00:15:37,110
What can I say?

408
00:15:37,244 --> 00:15:38,578
I, uh... [sighs]

409
00:15:38,713 --> 00:15:40,714
I like Cedar Cove better.

410
00:15:40,848 --> 00:15:42,766
You know? The, uh... 

411
00:15:42,900 --> 00:15:45,385
the fresh air, the clean water... 

412
00:15:47,238 --> 00:15:49,022
mostly the people.

413
00:15:51,342 --> 00:15:53,460
Certain people in particular.

414
00:16:01,268 --> 00:16:04,337
Hey... you're not the only person

415
00:16:04,472 --> 00:16:06,773
who can turn down a dream job, you know.

416
00:16:06,907 --> 00:16:08,558
I can't believe you did that.

417
00:16:08,693 --> 00:16:11,077
[Bob]: Ain't she a beauty?

418
00:16:11,195 --> 00:16:13,029
[Jack clears his throat]

419
00:16:13,164 --> 00:16:14,814
She certainly is.

420
00:16:14,949 --> 00:16:16,449
Yeah, Jack's come a long way

421
00:16:16,584 --> 00:16:18,318
since that picture frame he made you.

422
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:19,352
I love that picture frame.

423
00:16:19,470 --> 00:16:21,187
Yeah, but to make a canoe

424
00:16:21,322 --> 00:16:22,889
by hand... that's some gesture.

425
00:16:23,023 --> 00:16:24,023
Yeah, Bob.

426
00:16:24,158 --> 00:16:26,025
I think she gets it.

427
00:16:28,295 --> 00:16:30,096
Uh... 

428
00:16:30,231 --> 00:16:32,499
[Laughs]

429
00:16:34,085 --> 00:16:36,503
Well, um, I'll get out of your way.

430
00:16:36,637 --> 00:16:38,505
Hey, listen. Uh... 

431
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,690
something you wanted to talk about?

432
00:16:40,841 --> 00:16:41,975
You seemed a little anxious.

433
00:16:42,109 --> 00:16:45,795
No, I... I wanted to ask about the job.

434
00:16:47,431 --> 00:16:48,531
I'll call you later.

435
00:16:48,682 --> 00:16:50,516
Okay.

436
00:16:53,053 --> 00:16:55,505
[*]

437
00:17:06,712 --> 00:17:09,097
Warren! What are you doing here?

438
00:17:09,232 --> 00:17:11,266
Ah, it's my daily run. Same as you.

439
00:17:11,401 --> 00:17:12,884
You don't run.

440
00:17:13,019 --> 00:17:14,119
I do now.

441
00:17:14,237 --> 00:17:16,371
It's my attempt to de-stress after work.

442
00:17:16,522 --> 00:17:17,989
Is it working?

443
00:17:18,124 --> 00:17:19,241
Surprisingly, no.

444
00:17:19,375 --> 00:17:20,959
I just feel sweaty all the time.

445
00:17:21,094 --> 00:17:22,844
But it is part of my new outlook.

446
00:17:22,979 --> 00:17:23,845
How about you?

447
00:17:23,980 --> 00:17:25,764
I run here every day.

448
00:17:25,898 --> 00:17:26,965
You know that.

449
00:17:27,100 --> 00:17:28,316
So what are you saying? That I came here,

450
00:17:28,451 --> 00:17:29,951
hoping to run into you?

451
00:17:30,102 --> 00:17:31,403
No, it's just a huge coincidence.

452
00:17:31,537 --> 00:17:33,238
It could be!

453
00:17:33,372 --> 00:17:34,289
Look. I'm trying to make

454
00:17:34,424 --> 00:17:35,674
some real changes here, Justine.

455
00:17:35,792 --> 00:17:36,958
You know? Live a healthier life,

456
00:17:37,093 --> 00:17:38,427
be a better person.

457
00:17:38,561 --> 00:17:40,896
Those are some real ambitious goals.

458
00:17:41,046 --> 00:17:42,264
I wish you luck with that.

459
00:17:42,398 --> 00:17:44,116
Starting with running.

460
00:17:44,233 --> 00:17:45,233
Now, you don't mind

461
00:17:45,368 --> 00:17:47,119
if I tag along with you, do you?

462
00:17:47,236 --> 00:17:48,320
Not a problem.

463
00:17:48,454 --> 00:17:49,654
As long as you think you can keep up.

464
00:17:49,789 --> 00:17:50,589
Are you serious? Come on.

465
00:17:50,706 --> 00:17:52,007
I ran track in high school!

466
00:17:52,158 --> 00:17:54,142
Key words there being "high school."

467
00:17:55,845 --> 00:17:59,364
[Panting] Oh, no. No. Don't go that fast.

468
00:17:59,482 --> 00:18:01,116
[Wheezing] Okay... 

469
00:18:01,267 --> 00:18:04,252
Ah! Ah... oh... 

470
00:18:04,403 --> 00:18:06,071
[Grace]: What kind of drug charge?

471
00:18:06,205 --> 00:18:08,006
He wouldn't tell me.

472
00:18:08,141 --> 00:18:09,641
He just walked off the job, right in... 

473
00:18:09,775 --> 00:18:11,476
- ... the middle of his shift.
- He quit?

474
00:18:11,611 --> 00:18:12,878
I don't know.

475
00:18:13,012 --> 00:18:14,646
Well, it's probably for the best.

476
00:18:14,780 --> 00:18:15,680
God only knows what other secrets

477
00:18:15,815 --> 00:18:16,898
he's keeping from you.

478
00:18:18,851 --> 00:18:20,619
Honey, it's gonna be okay.

479
00:18:20,753 --> 00:18:21,820
[Sighs]

480
00:18:21,954 --> 00:18:24,623
I just... 

481
00:18:24,757 --> 00:18:26,691
I wish he would've told me.

482
00:18:26,826 --> 00:18:29,628
That's what bothers me the most.

483
00:18:29,762 --> 00:18:32,364
Well, sometimes, people like that

484
00:18:32,498 --> 00:18:34,633
find it hard to talk
about that sort of thing.

485
00:18:34,767 --> 00:18:36,535
That's just it.

486
00:18:36,669 --> 00:18:38,570
I don't think he is "like that."

487
00:18:38,704 --> 00:18:41,406
I look at his art, I look into his eyes... 

488
00:18:41,541 --> 00:18:43,808
John's no criminal.

489
00:18:44,944 --> 00:18:45,977
I'm just saying

490
00:18:46,112 --> 00:18:48,146
I think there's more to this.

491
00:18:48,281 --> 00:18:49,614
There has to be some kind of explanation.

492
00:18:49,749 --> 00:18:51,416
More secrets. Terrific.

493
00:18:51,551 --> 00:18:53,618
You just be careful, Maryellen.

494
00:18:53,753 --> 00:18:54,686
I will.

495
00:18:54,820 --> 00:18:55,987
Don't worry about me.

496
00:18:56,122 --> 00:18:57,722
I have to. It's my job.

497
00:18:59,058 --> 00:19:00,942
[Telephone rings]

498
00:19:03,129 --> 00:19:04,963
Hey, Olivia!

499
00:19:06,332 --> 00:19:08,800
W... you want to meet right... right now?

500
00:19:10,937 --> 00:19:13,505
So, what's this big news
you wanted to tell me about?

501
00:19:13,623 --> 00:19:14,756
Stan's leaving Melanie.

502
00:19:14,907 --> 00:19:15,757
What?

503
00:19:15,908 --> 00:19:16,791
They're getting a divorce

504
00:19:16,926 --> 00:19:17,876
and he's moving back here.

505
00:19:18,010 --> 00:19:19,427
Here? As in Cedar Cove-here?

506
00:19:19,562 --> 00:19:21,596
And how do you feel about that?

507
00:19:21,731 --> 00:19:23,014
Well, I'm happy for Justine... 

508
00:19:23,149 --> 00:19:24,566
Yeah, but it isn't exactly ideal

509
00:19:24,700 --> 00:19:26,518
to be sharing a zip code
with your ex-husband.

510
00:19:26,652 --> 00:19:28,620
He took us out to the point.

511
00:19:28,754 --> 00:19:31,723
We were out on the beach, skipping stones,

512
00:19:31,857 --> 00:19:34,459
and, for a minute there,
I was back in time,

513
00:19:34,594 --> 00:19:37,279
and it was all so perfect.

514
00:19:37,429 --> 00:19:39,748
He told me that he regretted leaving me,

515
00:19:39,898 --> 00:19:40,782
and that he missed me.

516
00:19:40,917 --> 00:19:42,117
Okay, wait a minute.

517
00:19:42,251 --> 00:19:43,535
So he's coming back here for you?

518
00:19:43,669 --> 00:19:44,586
He wants to get back with you?

519
00:19:44,720 --> 00:19:45,837
I don't know! I don't know!

520
00:19:45,972 --> 00:19:47,055
Well, what does Jack say about all this?

521
00:19:47,206 --> 00:19:48,089
I haven't told him yet.

522
00:19:48,241 --> 00:19:49,307
Why not?

523
00:19:49,442 --> 00:19:51,026
Well, he gave up that big job

524
00:19:51,176 --> 00:19:52,477
to stay here with me.

525
00:19:52,612 --> 00:19:54,529
I know, I need to tell him

526
00:19:54,664 --> 00:19:57,315
before somebody else does.

527
00:20:00,119 --> 00:20:02,604
Your business finally
brings you close to home,

528
00:20:02,738 --> 00:20:04,222
and I've hardly seen you.

529
00:20:04,357 --> 00:20:05,657
I've been so busy.

530
00:20:05,775 --> 00:20:07,943
You know you're my favorite girl.

531
00:20:08,077 --> 00:20:09,560
Mr. Big-Shot.

532
00:20:09,695 --> 00:20:11,212
Always so wrapped up in your work.

533
00:20:11,364 --> 00:20:13,548
It's time you took over
that company entirely.

534
00:20:13,683 --> 00:20:16,184
Why don't you call up the
ceo and tell him to resign?

535
00:20:16,335 --> 00:20:18,270
You know what? I'll do that.

536
00:20:18,387 --> 00:20:19,971
[Chuckles]

537
00:20:20,106 --> 00:20:21,139
Shh... 

538
00:20:21,274 --> 00:20:23,608
The judge is deliberating.

539
00:20:25,127 --> 00:20:26,928
What?

540
00:20:27,079 --> 00:20:28,179
What's with you?

541
00:20:28,314 --> 00:20:31,516
Stan's moving back to Cedar Cove.

542
00:20:31,634 --> 00:20:33,051
Ah... 

543
00:20:33,185 --> 00:20:35,853
The ex-husband returns.

544
00:20:35,988 --> 00:20:37,355
Way to cramp your style, huh?

545
00:20:37,490 --> 00:20:39,057
That's not it.

546
00:20:39,191 --> 00:20:40,725
You really don't mind that
Stan's moving back here?

547
00:20:40,860 --> 00:20:42,360
I don't know how I feel.

548
00:20:43,879 --> 00:20:45,463
[Hushed]: Back up!

549
00:20:45,598 --> 00:20:47,482
Do not make a sound.

550
00:20:49,435 --> 00:20:51,469
Hey! Look who's here.

551
00:20:51,604 --> 00:20:52,470
[Hushed]: What are you doing?

552
00:20:52,605 --> 00:20:54,155
Making him squirm.

553
00:20:54,306 --> 00:20:55,740
Hi there!

554
00:20:55,858 --> 00:20:57,809
Hello, ladies! Mwah. Hi, sweetheart.

555
00:20:57,943 --> 00:20:59,310
Hello, will.

556
00:20:59,445 --> 00:21:01,446
Grace. I haven't seen you around.

557
00:21:01,580 --> 00:21:03,531
Well, I've been avoiding you.

558
00:21:05,334 --> 00:21:06,451
[Forced chuckle]

559
00:21:06,585 --> 00:21:07,752
She's just kidding.

560
00:21:07,870 --> 00:21:09,204
[Laughs] Funny.

561
00:21:09,338 --> 00:21:11,256
So, how's dinner?

562
00:21:11,374 --> 00:21:12,841
Will's headed home in a few days,

563
00:21:12,991 --> 00:21:15,427
so I've been spending as
much time as I can with him.

564
00:21:15,544 --> 00:21:16,628
Really. Why so soon?

565
00:21:16,762 --> 00:21:17,679
I have to head back to Atlanta.

566
00:21:17,830 --> 00:21:18,797
Ah. Back to your wife.

567
00:21:18,931 --> 00:21:20,215
That is where she lives.

568
00:21:20,349 --> 00:21:22,300
And I hear you have this fabulous trip... 

569
00:21:22,435 --> 00:21:23,601
- planned together.
- Pardon?

570
00:21:23,719 --> 00:21:24,502
Mm-hmm, yeah, Olivia told me all about it.

571
00:21:24,637 --> 00:21:26,388
France! How charming.

572
00:21:26,522 --> 00:21:27,639
Why don't you join us?

573
00:21:27,773 --> 00:21:28,807
Sure!

574
00:21:28,941 --> 00:21:30,475
Oh, no, thanks, we can't stay.

575
00:21:30,609 --> 00:21:31,476
We can't?

576
00:21:31,610 --> 00:21:32,694
We need to drop off that thing?

577
00:21:32,845 --> 00:21:33,978
That's right, too.

578
00:21:34,113 --> 00:21:35,730
We do have that thing to drop off.

579
00:21:35,865 --> 00:21:38,566
Well, you all enjoy yourselves now.

580
00:21:38,734 --> 00:21:40,852
[**]

581
00:21:40,986 --> 00:21:42,737
Mom, you can't be playing games like this.

582
00:21:42,872 --> 00:21:44,522
Trust me, it's not a game.

583
00:21:56,245 --> 00:21:57,913
Maryellen?

584
00:21:58,048 --> 00:21:59,815
Thank you for meeting me.

585
00:21:59,949 --> 00:22:01,684
I don't know what to call you.

586
00:22:01,818 --> 00:22:03,485
Mrs. Bowman? Mrs. Kirkland?

587
00:22:03,620 --> 00:22:05,521
Donna.

588
00:22:05,655 --> 00:22:07,589
Please.

589
00:22:07,724 --> 00:22:09,708
Can I get you anything?

590
00:22:09,843 --> 00:22:11,460
Oh, no, thanks. I'm fine.

591
00:22:11,594 --> 00:22:14,363
I was so glad you emailed me.

592
00:22:14,481 --> 00:22:16,732
Does Daniel... I mean, John... know?

593
00:22:16,866 --> 00:22:19,568
No. He'd probably be very angry

594
00:22:19,703 --> 00:22:21,370
if he found out.

595
00:22:21,504 --> 00:22:24,573
He is your son, right?

596
00:22:24,708 --> 00:22:27,109
Yes.

597
00:22:27,227 --> 00:22:29,878
But he hasn't spoken to
me or his father in years.

598
00:22:30,013 --> 00:22:32,815
I learned he spent time in prison.

599
00:22:32,949 --> 00:22:34,516
A drug charge?

600
00:22:34,651 --> 00:22:36,752
What happened?

601
00:22:36,870 --> 00:22:40,189
May I ask first what your
relationship is with him?

602
00:22:41,391 --> 00:22:43,659
Honestly, I... 

603
00:22:43,777 --> 00:22:45,194
I don't know.

604
00:22:45,328 --> 00:22:48,130
We've dated a few times.

605
00:22:48,264 --> 00:22:49,832
I like him a lot. He's a... [laughs]

606
00:22:49,966 --> 00:22:53,669
a wonderful artist and chef, but... 

607
00:22:55,171 --> 00:22:57,539
I can't live with all the secrecy.

608
00:22:57,674 --> 00:22:59,508
He won't tell me anything.

609
00:22:59,642 --> 00:23:01,043
[Sighs]

610
00:23:01,177 --> 00:23:04,096
John spent five years in jail.

611
00:23:04,247 --> 00:23:06,381
What kind of drug charge was it?

612
00:23:06,516 --> 00:23:07,983
Was he dealing?

613
00:23:08,118 --> 00:23:10,285
Oh, no. No, no. He... 

614
00:23:13,523 --> 00:23:16,592
John had an older brother, Jim.

615
00:23:17,961 --> 00:23:20,095
Straight "A" student.

616
00:23:20,230 --> 00:23:22,164
Class president.

617
00:23:23,633 --> 00:23:25,501
He and John were pulled over for speeding,

618
00:23:25,635 --> 00:23:27,369
and Jim... 

619
00:23:27,504 --> 00:23:29,204
was carrying drugs,

620
00:23:29,339 --> 00:23:30,706
and he hid them under the front seat.

621
00:23:32,809 --> 00:23:34,643
The cops found them?

622
00:23:36,012 --> 00:23:37,112
Because it was John's car,

623
00:23:37,247 --> 00:23:38,580
he was the one who was arrested.

624
00:23:40,483 --> 00:23:43,018
He pleaded with the cops, told
them the drugs weren't his,

625
00:23:43,153 --> 00:23:44,820
but... [sighs]

626
00:23:44,954 --> 00:23:47,806
No one believed him.

627
00:23:49,309 --> 00:23:51,693
No one? Not even you?

628
00:23:53,429 --> 00:23:55,013
His... his father and I, we... 

629
00:23:55,164 --> 00:23:56,882
Why didn't Jim tell the truth?

630
00:23:57,016 --> 00:23:59,935
He let his brother go to jail?

631
00:24:00,069 --> 00:24:01,737
[Sighs]

632
00:24:01,855 --> 00:24:06,308
John was four months from
completing his sentence when Jim...

633
00:24:06,426 --> 00:24:08,994
died of a heroin overdose.

634
00:24:11,881 --> 00:24:15,517
And that's when we learned the truth.

635
00:24:15,652 --> 00:24:18,353
John hasn't spoken to us since.

636
00:24:19,656 --> 00:24:21,323
We've been looking for him,

637
00:24:21,457 --> 00:24:22,825
trying to reach out to him.

638
00:24:22,959 --> 00:24:24,660
We knew he changed his name,

639
00:24:24,794 --> 00:24:28,197
and now he's probably gone again.

640
00:24:29,532 --> 00:24:31,733
And who knows if I'll find him this time.

641
00:24:31,901 --> 00:24:34,102
[**]

642
00:24:50,620 --> 00:24:53,288
[Chuckling with pride]

643
00:25:14,928 --> 00:25:16,345
No... 

644
00:25:16,479 --> 00:25:18,263
Oh, come on! No!

645
00:25:26,222 --> 00:25:28,173
Again?

646
00:25:28,308 --> 00:25:29,791
What?

647
00:25:29,926 --> 00:25:31,009
What are you, stalking me now?

648
00:25:31,144 --> 00:25:33,262
I told you this already,
this is my daily run.

649
00:25:33,396 --> 00:25:35,096
That's why I left earlier today.

650
00:25:35,231 --> 00:25:36,281
Justine, come on.

651
00:25:36,432 --> 00:25:37,816
You didn't have fun with me last time?

652
00:25:37,951 --> 00:25:39,201
I even let you beat me.

653
00:25:39,319 --> 00:25:40,636
<i>- You let me?
- Yeah!</i>

654
00:25:40,770 --> 00:25:41,920
Alright, fine. Look.

655
00:25:42,071 --> 00:25:43,705
If you don't want company,

656
00:25:43,840 --> 00:25:45,240
just say the word, and
I'll leave you alone.

657
00:25:45,375 --> 00:25:48,227
I don't want company.

658
00:25:48,377 --> 00:25:49,344
Where's Seth been, anyway?

659
00:25:49,479 --> 00:25:50,879
I haven't seen him around lately.

660
00:25:51,014 --> 00:25:51,897
Alright, if you're gonna insist on

661
00:25:52,031 --> 00:25:52,981
running with me,

662
00:25:53,116 --> 00:25:54,283
- can you at least keep quiet?
- I will.

663
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:56,385
Absolutely. Under one condition.

664
00:25:56,502 --> 00:25:58,203
We ease the pace a little bit.

665
00:25:58,338 --> 00:25:59,755
I'm more of a slow-and-steady kind of guy.

666
00:25:59,872 --> 00:26:00,361
Slow and steady?

667
00:26:00,365 --> 00:26:01,776
Yeah, we do that, I promise you,

668
00:26:01,778 --> 00:26:02,488
I'll stay quiet.

669
00:26:03,960 --> 00:26:06,728
Oh! Come on. No.

670
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,897
Why did I not see that one coming?

671
00:26:09,032 --> 00:26:10,632
Justine... 

672
00:26:10,767 --> 00:26:11,833
Okay.

673
00:26:11,951 --> 00:26:14,786
[Calls out]: I'm only doing this once!

674
00:26:14,938 --> 00:26:16,705
'Cause I will never be able
to get out of bed after this!

675
00:26:18,891 --> 00:26:20,809
[Sloshing]

676
00:26:22,729 --> 00:26:24,696
Hey, Jack.

677
00:26:24,831 --> 00:26:25,647
Hey.

678
00:26:25,782 --> 00:26:26,865
What happened here?

679
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:29,885
<i>Oh, just re-enacting the Titanic.</i>

680
00:26:30,019 --> 00:26:32,104
Oh. Sorry to hear that.

681
00:26:32,254 --> 00:26:33,639
Yeah.

682
00:26:33,773 --> 00:26:37,025
Well, back to the drawing board, I guess.

683
00:26:37,160 --> 00:26:38,760
Hey! Uh... 

684
00:26:38,895 --> 00:26:40,679
is that your boat?

685
00:26:40,830 --> 00:26:41,647
Yeah. Just bought it.

686
00:26:41,797 --> 00:26:43,065
Ah. So, what,

687
00:26:43,182 --> 00:26:44,266
you're just gonna keep it here

688
00:26:44,400 --> 00:26:45,350
while you visit Justine?

689
00:26:45,485 --> 00:26:47,836
Olivia didn't tell you?

690
00:26:47,971 --> 00:26:49,421
Tell me what?

691
00:26:49,555 --> 00:26:51,556
I'm moving back.

692
00:26:51,691 --> 00:26:53,659
My wife and I separated.

693
00:26:57,313 --> 00:26:58,747
So you're coming back here?

694
00:26:58,881 --> 00:27:01,350
- Well, I want to be closer to Justine.
- You know what?

695
00:27:01,484 --> 00:27:02,717
Don't give me that.

696
00:27:02,852 --> 00:27:04,186
Alright? Just don't.

697
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:06,154
You came back here for Olivia.

698
00:27:08,374 --> 00:27:10,092
No, Jack. But, listen... 

699
00:27:10,226 --> 00:27:11,677
No, no. You listen to me.

700
00:27:11,811 --> 00:27:14,479
Look, Stan, it's time for
you to man up, alright?

701
00:27:14,630 --> 00:27:16,665
Admit that you still have feelings Olivia.

702
00:27:16,783 --> 00:27:18,033
It's more complicated than that.

703
00:27:18,167 --> 00:27:19,067
Yeah, you bet it is.

704
00:27:19,202 --> 00:27:20,285
Because she's with me.

705
00:27:20,420 --> 00:27:21,620
I know that,

706
00:27:21,771 --> 00:27:23,055
and I'm trying to be respectful.

707
00:27:23,189 --> 00:27:24,439
You're not trying to be respectful!

708
00:27:24,557 --> 00:27:26,305
You're here! Look, why
don't you just admit it?

709
00:27:26,327 --> 00:27:27,476
You want her back, don't you?

710
00:27:28,811 --> 00:27:31,313
[Yells]: Come on, Stan! Just say it!

711
00:27:31,447 --> 00:27:32,614
I want her back.

712
00:27:34,150 --> 00:27:35,567
Exactly.

713
00:27:38,654 --> 00:27:41,456
So what are we supposed to do about this?

714
00:27:43,626 --> 00:27:47,963
Well, I don't think it's
for you or I to decide.

715
00:27:48,081 --> 00:27:49,464
Is it?

716
00:27:49,582 --> 00:27:52,250
Yeah. You're right.

717
00:28:05,389 --> 00:28:06,722
Thanks for the water.

718
00:28:06,857 --> 00:28:08,774
My pleasure.

719
00:28:08,909 --> 00:28:11,177
I always come prepared.

720
00:28:11,311 --> 00:28:14,313
How are you feeling, anyway?

721
00:28:14,431 --> 00:28:15,448
Actually, better.

722
00:28:15,565 --> 00:28:17,016
Better than ever.

723
00:28:17,150 --> 00:28:19,969
And by "better," I mean incredibly sore.

724
00:28:20,120 --> 00:28:21,253
What is that?

725
00:28:21,388 --> 00:28:23,205
It's aspirin.

726
00:28:23,356 --> 00:28:25,458
Like I said, I always come prepared.

727
00:28:28,945 --> 00:28:30,529
Turning my life around, Justine,

728
00:28:30,664 --> 00:28:32,197
and I have you to thank for that.

729
00:28:32,332 --> 00:28:34,266
Warren, I... 

730
00:28:34,401 --> 00:28:36,168
No, no. Hear me out. Seriously. I mean it.

731
00:28:36,286 --> 00:28:39,305
If it wasn't for you and your father,

732
00:28:39,439 --> 00:28:42,141
I don't know what would've happened.

733
00:28:42,275 --> 00:28:44,943
I just want to say

734
00:28:45,078 --> 00:28:47,213
how thankful I am that
you were there for me.

735
00:28:47,330 --> 00:28:49,047
I just wish there was someone out there

- What? I'm not starting anything.

738
00:28:53,670 --> 00:28:54,970
I'm just... I don't know.

739
00:28:54,915 --> 00:28:56,799
I'm just thinking about this guy, Seth.

740
00:28:56,917 --> 00:28:58,050
I mean, what guy

741
00:28:58,185 --> 00:29:00,135
walks out on such an
amazing woman like you?

742
00:29:00,270 --> 00:29:01,136
I mean, it's ridiculous.

743
00:29:01,271 --> 00:29:02,305
He didn't walk out on me.

744
00:29:02,439 --> 00:29:03,589
Oh, okay. He didn't? Well, I'm sorry.

745
00:29:03,740 --> 00:29:05,208
I std corrected.

746

Look, Warren, what we had... 

747
00:29:07,694 --> 00:29:09,979
Is in the past. I know.

748
00:29:10,113 --> 00:29:12,114
And I'm okay with that.

Look, I'm just looking
for a running buddy, okay?

Is that too much to ask?

751

I should get going.

No, thanks.

Why didn't you tell me that
Stan was moving back here?

760
00:29:48,385 --> 00:29:49,652
I should have.

761
00:29:49,786 --> 00:29:51,220
You told him that you were okay with that?

Him living here?

He wants to be close to Justine.

764

You know, I am so sick of him
playing that card with you.

Don't do this.

No, no. Listen to me.

still has feelings for you.

Stan and I share a lot

Some of them are sweet

781

and some of them are so
horrible they cut me to my core.

782

He wants to make up for walking out on us.

He wants a chance

to talk about the pain
that we lived through.

785
00:30:42,372 --> 00:30:44,373
No. He doesn't want your forgiveness.

No! He wants you, Olivia!

787
00:30:46,677 --> 00:30:48,094

just rewind everything

788

and pick up where he left off.

789
00:30:49,479 --> 00:30:50,913
Well, that's not what I want.

790
00:30:51,048 --> 00:30:52,581
But do you know that?

791
00:30:52,699 --> 00:30:55,534
I mean, do you know how
you're gonna feel for sure?

792
00:30:55,669 --> 00:30:57,920
Listen, for years, you've been waiting

793

for him to come back here
and resolve things with you.

I am the first man that you have
had a serious relationship with

He let his guard down, we both did,

Misinterpreted?

wanted to see me again.

the calling and the texting.

This is gonna kill Georgia.
How could you do this to me?

865

I didn't do anything to you,

866

and I understand that you are
upset about a lot of things,

867

thought I could count on

What're you doing? You're leaving?

877
00:34:28,106 --> 00:34:29,856
I told the landlord I'd be
gone by the end of the week.

878
00:34:29,991 --> 00:34:31,541
Why?

879
00:34:31,692 --> 00:34:34,144
Because of me?

I know how this goes.

881

and then the job disappears,
the friends disappear.

883
00:34:40,868 --> 00:34:43,770
Well, thanks a lot for assuming
I'd be like everyone else.

884
00:34:43,905 --> 00:34:45,705
So you don't mind that
I spent time behind bars?

No.

That's exactly what my
last girlfriend said.

887

Then, a week later, she dumped me.

888
00:34:54,081 --> 00:34:56,600
Because of that?

889
00:34:56,750 --> 00:34:58,819
Or because you're a secretive person

890
00:34:58,953 --> 00:35:00,837
who won't let anyone into your life?

891
00:35:02,990 --> 00:35:06,376
I know what happened, John.

happened to you before.

909

then stop running.
