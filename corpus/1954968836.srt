1
00:00:13,627 --> 00:00:16,095
Where monsters rampage,
I'm there to take them down!

2
00:00:16,663 --> 00:00:19,632
Where treasure glitters,
I'm there to claim it!

3
00:00:19,700 --> 00:00:24,069
Where an enemy rises to face me,
victory will be mine!

4
00:01:49,689 --> 00:01:52,624
I'm Lina Inverse, sorcery genius!

5
00:01:52,726 --> 00:01:56,685
We finally made it to Sairaag
and found who was behind all this.

6
00:01:56,797 --> 00:02:00,927
The one who falsely accused us
and put a price on our heads...

7
00:02:01,034 --> 00:02:03,002
...was a sorceress named Eris.

8
00:02:03,103 --> 00:02:06,072
And it turns out she's
one of Rezo's followers!

9
00:02:06,173 --> 00:02:10,371
Things were tight, but we were
saved by good old Zelgadis.

10
00:02:10,477 --> 00:02:14,709
And just as we were about to
strike back, a new foe appeared.

11
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:19,445
I think it's time we found out
exactly what's going on here!

12
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:33,124
Rezo, the Red Priest?!

13
00:02:42,108 --> 00:02:43,405
I got it...

14
00:02:43,810 --> 00:02:46,301
- You just LOOK like him!
- You mean he's a fake?

15
00:02:46,847 --> 00:02:48,246
He can't be the real one!

16
00:02:48,849 --> 00:02:50,908
It has to be some
kind of horrible joke!

17
00:02:51,418 --> 00:02:54,410
They did a great job of finding
a double for him, didn't they?

18
00:02:54,521 --> 00:02:59,151
Well... Actually I can't exactly
remember what he looks like.

19
00:02:59,726 --> 00:03:02,388
Gourry,
would you just SHUT UP?!

20
00:03:02,496 --> 00:03:03,224
Right, Zel?

21
00:03:03,530 --> 00:03:06,021
Yes. A very clever fake!

22
00:03:06,132 --> 00:03:08,657
Why are you all so sure
he's an imposter?

23
00:03:09,202 --> 00:03:11,534
Because we fought Rezo before...

24
00:03:11,872 --> 00:03:14,500
...and we managed to kill him!

25
00:03:16,543 --> 00:03:22,038
WHAT?! Rezo, who everyone says
is a great sage?! You killed him?!

26
00:03:22,148 --> 00:03:24,082
Miss Lina, you're all really...!

27
00:03:24,417 --> 00:03:25,475
Incredible?

28
00:03:25,886 --> 00:03:27,683
I was going to say "villains."

29
00:03:27,888 --> 00:03:31,415
- We're what?!
- But...! But...!

30
00:03:31,525 --> 00:03:35,825
And who's he?! He's so
creepy and suspicious-looking!

31
00:03:35,929 --> 00:03:37,055
Well, excuse me.

32
00:03:37,163 --> 00:03:40,064
Amelia, anyone who judges
people by looks or rumors...

33
00:03:40,166 --> 00:03:41,793
...gives justice a bad name!

34
00:03:41,902 --> 00:03:45,463
Okay, Zelgadis may seem
suspicious at first glance...

35
00:03:45,572 --> 00:03:46,800
Well, excuse me!

36
00:03:46,907 --> 00:03:49,137
...but he's sort of okay.

37
00:03:49,242 --> 00:03:49,970
Sort of?!

38
00:03:50,577 --> 00:03:54,343
Rezo, the Red Priest, wasn't the
great sage people said he was.

39
00:03:55,115 --> 00:03:56,480
Really?

40
00:03:56,583 --> 00:03:59,746
Really! That's why he
has to be an imposter!

41
00:03:59,853 --> 00:04:02,481
I know it's a longshot,
but maybe he IS the real one.

42
00:04:02,589 --> 00:04:03,851
No way! He's a fake!

43
00:04:03,957 --> 00:04:06,790
Now you're judging people by
rumor and appearances, Miss Lina.

44
00:04:06,927 --> 00:04:11,227
That doesn't apply here!
Anyway, I say he's a fake!

45
00:04:12,599 --> 00:04:15,227
Rather than asking if I'm
the real one or not...

46
00:04:15,602 --> 00:04:19,060
...isn't there a question that
needs to be answered first?

47
00:04:19,272 --> 00:04:20,102
Meaning what?!

48
00:04:20,607 --> 00:04:24,270
The one of whether you
really killed me or not.

49
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:28,638
We killed him! Meaning you
aren't the real Red Priest!

50
00:04:29,449 --> 00:04:32,885
Well, then...
Why don't I try my luck?!

51
00:04:44,264 --> 00:04:46,596
Well, you've got
the attitude down pat!

52
00:04:50,637 --> 00:04:52,935
Fireball!

53
00:04:59,312 --> 00:05:02,042
Take this! Ghozu Vro!

54
00:05:08,488 --> 00:05:09,546
Impossible!

55
00:05:13,660 --> 00:05:17,391
I see. You aren't just
some imposter, are you?

56
00:05:17,664 --> 00:05:20,258
Well, then, allow me
to make the next move.

57
00:05:39,653 --> 00:05:41,280
Man, he's powerful!

58
00:05:41,354 --> 00:05:43,015
This protection field
isn't going to hold out!

59
00:05:43,390 --> 00:05:45,984
Oh, I've hardly even begun!

60
00:05:49,362 --> 00:05:52,661
Damn! I don't have
time to recast the spell!

61
00:05:57,003 --> 00:05:59,995
What was that?! Someone just
cast a major protection spell!

62
00:06:04,377 --> 00:06:07,107
Sylphiel!
What are you doing here?

63
00:06:07,714 --> 00:06:11,275
Well, I was worried
about dear Gourry...

64
00:06:11,384 --> 00:06:13,784
...so I thought I'd
go looking for you.

65
00:06:14,054 --> 00:06:16,022
You looked like you
were being attacked.

66
00:06:17,323 --> 00:06:19,621
Looked, nothing!
We WERE being attacked!

67
00:06:19,726 --> 00:06:21,591
Oh, how terrible!

68
00:06:21,695 --> 00:06:25,256
Oh, of all the...! Never mind.
With Sylphiel here to protect us...

69
00:06:25,365 --> 00:06:27,356
...we can give him the works!

70
00:06:28,401 --> 00:06:29,766
- Run for it!
- Hey!

71
00:06:30,336 --> 00:06:32,065
Damn! We have no choice!

72
00:06:34,641 --> 00:06:36,700
Miss Lina!

73
00:06:41,014 --> 00:06:44,711
Wow, so that's who
you are, Mr. Zelgadis.

74
00:06:45,385 --> 00:06:49,719
And you two are a Seyruun princess
and a friend of Gourry's.

75
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:54,151
Now that we've calmed down,
anyone know who the Rezo twin is?

76
00:06:54,761 --> 00:06:58,322
And why did he let us escape
without trying to follow us?

77
00:06:58,431 --> 00:07:02,925
Search me. Anyway, as long
as we don't know who he is...

78
00:07:03,036 --> 00:07:05,470
...we consider him an imposter,
although a powerful one.

79
00:07:05,805 --> 00:07:06,635
Right.

80
00:07:06,740 --> 00:07:08,674
You're sure he
isn't the real one?

81
00:07:08,775 --> 00:07:12,677
Well...
I'm sure we killed Rezo!

82
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:15,077
We must have...

83
00:07:17,383 --> 00:07:20,216
Well, maybe you killed
the imposter instead.

84
00:07:20,386 --> 00:07:23,617
Uh, no...
That's not possible.

85
00:07:23,723 --> 00:07:25,088
Oh...

86
00:07:38,805 --> 00:07:41,706
The one we killed had
to have been the real Rezo.

87
00:07:41,808 --> 00:07:43,776
Then who was
the Rezo we just saw?

88
00:07:43,877 --> 00:07:45,469
Maybe another copy.

89
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:51,717
If it was a copy of Rezo...

90
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:55,117
...how is he able to
cast spells that powerful?

91
00:07:56,790 --> 00:08:00,726
It's not my area of expertise, so
I'm not clear on the details. Okay!

92
00:08:00,827 --> 00:08:01,987
What are you going to do?

93
00:08:02,095 --> 00:08:03,221
Go ask an expert!

94
00:08:03,830 --> 00:08:06,390
We won't learn anything
just hanging around here.

95
00:08:06,499 --> 00:08:09,059
All right, and I'll try some
other things in the meantime.

96
00:08:09,169 --> 00:08:10,397
What are you doing?

97
00:08:10,503 --> 00:08:12,630
I have a few things
to investigate.

98
00:08:13,173 --> 00:08:16,142
I'll meet you here
tomorrow at noon. See you.

99
00:08:17,343 --> 00:08:19,311
Sure thing. Be careful!

100
00:08:19,412 --> 00:08:21,744
Anyway, Miss Lina, do you
have any sorcerer friends...

101
00:08:21,848 --> 00:08:23,748
...who are experts
in copying people?

102
00:08:23,850 --> 00:08:25,477
Well, not friends exactly.

103
00:08:25,852 --> 00:08:28,013
But there's a dark
sorcerers' guild nearby...

104
00:08:28,121 --> 00:08:30,089
...that specializes in chimeras!

105
00:08:30,456 --> 00:08:31,684
NOT AGAIN!!!

106
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:34,092
Stop doing this to me!

107
00:08:34,194 --> 00:08:36,822
Hey! I see it! There it is!

108
00:08:38,832 --> 00:08:40,459
Please, you can't
go in there!

109
00:08:40,567 --> 00:08:44,503
Come on, you let people in
for study, right?! Move it!

110
00:08:50,944 --> 00:08:55,108
What's the big idea,
you uncivilized hoodlums?!

111
00:08:55,215 --> 00:08:57,183
No, singular. Just her!

112
00:08:58,151 --> 00:09:02,451
They want to study and
give us a big donation.

113
00:09:02,856 --> 00:09:05,484
A donation?! So, what
do you want to know?

114
00:09:06,192 --> 00:09:09,787
How much of the original's
power can a copy have?

115
00:09:09,896 --> 00:09:10,885
All of it!

116
00:09:11,231 --> 00:09:12,289
Really?!

117
00:09:12,398 --> 00:09:13,831
Well, I'd like to say that.

118
00:09:13,933 --> 00:09:15,059
Which is it then?!

119
00:09:15,735 --> 00:09:19,796
Well, it can have all of the
physical abilities of the original.

120
00:09:20,240 --> 00:09:23,141
Strength, speed, reflexes...

121
00:09:23,243 --> 00:09:25,837
This is our latest
copy cultivator.

122
00:09:25,945 --> 00:09:31,144
It can copy an ordinary person's
memories and experiences.

123
00:09:31,684 --> 00:09:33,151
An ordinary person's?

124
00:09:33,253 --> 00:09:36,154
Well, we don't have any
extraordinary people here.

125
00:09:36,256 --> 00:09:38,019
Like a sorcery genius or
an expert swordsman.

126
00:09:38,558 --> 00:09:42,460
We've no idea how much of those
special skills we can duplicate.

127
00:09:42,929 --> 00:09:44,362
Why don't you experiment?

128
00:09:44,564 --> 00:09:48,159
Geniuses and experts don't
grow on trees, you know!

129
00:09:48,268 --> 00:09:50,828
We don't have any samples.

130
00:09:50,937 --> 00:09:55,203
I see... Okay, you can
use US as your samples!

131
00:09:55,308 --> 00:09:56,707
You mean it?!

132
00:09:56,809 --> 00:09:58,834
Take cute little Gourry over here!

133
00:09:58,945 --> 00:10:01,175
Despite appearances, he's
actually an expert swordsman!

134
00:10:01,281 --> 00:10:02,441
Oh, that's right!

135
00:10:02,882 --> 00:10:03,849
He... He's what?!

136
00:10:04,217 --> 00:10:06,777
So, you need a bucket of his
blood as a sample, right?

137
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:08,949
Not at all!
A lock of hair will do!

138
00:10:09,255 --> 00:10:11,155
Not a problem!

139
00:10:11,257 --> 00:10:12,884
Stop! I refuse!

140
00:10:15,295 --> 00:10:17,729
- C'mon, Gourry!
- Don't be ridiculous!

141
00:10:17,830 --> 00:10:21,266
Sylphiel, please! Stop them!

142
00:10:23,236 --> 00:10:24,225
Okay!

143
00:10:26,572 --> 00:10:29,507
Wouldn't it be wonderful
to have more of you?

144
00:10:29,909 --> 00:10:32,742
I can't see the sense of it,
but you did it, Sylphiel!

145
00:10:32,845 --> 00:10:33,971
Quickly, give it to me!

146
00:10:34,247 --> 00:10:37,512
You, too, Sylphiel?!
You, too?! How could you?!

147
00:10:42,588 --> 00:10:44,488
So, how long till it's done?

148
00:10:44,590 --> 00:10:46,888
A day and a night.

149
00:10:46,993 --> 00:10:49,393
- We don't have that long!
- No, cut that out!

150
00:10:50,029 --> 00:10:52,964
Oh, relax! I'm just
adding more growth culture.

151
00:10:54,600 --> 00:10:56,898
Hey, Pops! Can I use
the one over there?

152
00:10:57,003 --> 00:11:01,269
She's a sorcery genius!
I guarantee the power!

153
00:11:01,374 --> 00:11:02,705
Oh, that's right!

154
00:11:03,009 --> 00:11:05,136
Oh! Really? Really?!

155
00:11:05,345 --> 00:11:07,472
Hey! Stop it, Gourry!

156
00:11:07,580 --> 00:11:09,445
I'm just doing to you
what you did to me!

157
00:11:09,549 --> 00:11:11,210
Stop kidding around!

158
00:11:11,317 --> 00:11:12,215
Why, you...!

159
00:11:12,318 --> 00:11:14,912
- Adding the growth culture!
- No, that's too much!

160
00:11:15,021 --> 00:11:17,319
How could you rip my hair out?!

161
00:11:32,572 --> 00:11:34,540
Ah, they're finished.

162
00:11:48,254 --> 00:11:49,721
Hi!

163
00:11:50,523 --> 00:11:52,457
That's the cutest
thing I've ever seen!

164
00:11:52,558 --> 00:11:53,820
What happened?

165
00:11:53,926 --> 00:11:55,826
It's tiny!

166
00:11:55,928 --> 00:11:59,386
You rushed the growth,
so it didn't mature fully!

167
00:12:00,566 --> 00:12:01,533
I'm hungry!

168
00:12:01,968 --> 00:12:04,732
Well, it's definitely got the
original's personality.

169
00:12:04,804 --> 00:12:05,793
What's that supposed to mean?

170
00:12:06,239 --> 00:12:08,230
This one's finished, too!

171
00:12:10,176 --> 00:12:11,234
Yo!

172
00:12:12,178 --> 00:12:13,839
I'm hungry and demand some food!

173
00:12:13,946 --> 00:12:16,847
Looks like it's got the
original's personality, too.

174
00:12:16,949 --> 00:12:17,745
Meaning what?!

175
00:12:18,217 --> 00:12:19,115
Lina Kick!

176
00:12:19,218 --> 00:12:20,583
What was that for?!

177
00:12:23,156 --> 00:12:25,920
Wow, they're
exactly like you two.

178
00:12:27,660 --> 00:12:29,491
Huh?! What's happening?!

179
00:12:46,245 --> 00:12:49,646
Victory! Yay! Yay!

180
00:12:49,982 --> 00:12:51,882
All right! Great job!

181
00:12:51,984 --> 00:12:53,918
Guys, you suck!

182
00:12:54,253 --> 00:12:56,118
Bye-bye!

183
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:04,388
What's wrong?!

184
00:13:04,997 --> 00:13:06,157
What happened?!

185
00:13:06,265 --> 00:13:08,961
You overloaded the machine!

186
00:13:17,009 --> 00:13:19,239
Thanks for the help!

187
00:13:19,345 --> 00:13:21,336
And don't come back!

188
00:13:24,517 --> 00:13:27,315
No hard feelings, okay?

189
00:13:47,340 --> 00:13:49,535
For crying out loud!

190
00:13:51,043 --> 00:13:53,739
Is this what happens when
he exerts himself a little?

191
00:13:54,046 --> 00:13:56,014
Your beloved Rezo?

192
00:13:56,349 --> 00:13:58,078
Get out...
I said get out!

193
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:01,083
Sure thing. Sorry to bother.

194
00:14:28,080 --> 00:14:29,411
What happened to you?

195
00:14:29,749 --> 00:14:31,649
Oh, morning, Zelgadis.

196
00:14:31,751 --> 00:14:33,719
It's afternoon.

197
00:14:35,354 --> 00:14:37,413
So, did you find out
anything about copies?

198
00:14:37,757 --> 00:14:41,818
Not much. Just that it's
possible to make a perfect copy.

199
00:14:41,928 --> 00:14:43,088
No answers there.

200
00:14:43,429 --> 00:14:45,659
So, what were you checking out?

201
00:14:45,765 --> 00:14:48,359
Oh, just some stuff on Rezo.

202
00:14:48,467 --> 00:14:49,627
On Rezo?

203
00:14:49,735 --> 00:14:52,533
What I checked on wasn't
about the fake Rezo.

204
00:14:52,638 --> 00:14:54,162
I mean on the real Rezo.

205
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:57,738
So, what did you find out
about the real Rezo?

206
00:14:58,110 --> 00:14:59,702
Well...

207
00:14:59,812 --> 00:15:01,871
C'mon Zel, why so gloomy?

208
00:15:02,748 --> 00:15:06,309
Rezo told me something
a long time ago.

209
00:15:06,419 --> 00:15:09,354
About an ancient laboratory
he sealed away...

210
00:15:09,455 --> 00:15:13,084
...which contains the books of
spells and sorcery he's collected.

211
00:15:13,459 --> 00:15:16,019
Rezo's sorcery collection?

212
00:15:16,128 --> 00:15:19,097
They couldn't help him
cure his eyes, apparently.

213
00:15:19,799 --> 00:15:22,324
But it seems there are some
extraordinary magic books in it.

214
00:15:23,769 --> 00:15:27,034
If Rezo collected them,
they've gotta be extraordinary!

215
00:15:27,139 --> 00:15:28,697
Where is it?! Where? Where?

216
00:15:28,808 --> 00:15:29,672
Sairaag.

217
00:15:30,476 --> 00:15:33,968
Sairaag! Well, lucky
we're here, isn't it?!

218
00:15:34,814 --> 00:15:37,339
Once I learned that
from my investigation...

219
00:15:37,450 --> 00:15:39,441
...I discovered something else.

220
00:15:40,152 --> 00:15:43,883
Rezo's sealed laboratory is in
the ruins of old Sairaag!

221
00:15:44,457 --> 00:15:45,321
The old city?!

222
00:15:45,825 --> 00:15:47,224
Out there?!

223
00:15:47,827 --> 00:15:50,728
- You know about it?
- It's a long story.

224
00:15:50,830 --> 00:15:54,391
The ruins of old Sairaag...
They're not far from here.

225
00:15:54,500 --> 00:15:56,866
On the other side of the
great holy tree, Flagoon.

226
00:15:57,336 --> 00:15:59,327
It's a desolate
place of ruins now.

227
00:15:59,438 --> 00:16:00,735
Will you guide me there?

228
00:16:00,840 --> 00:16:02,364
Sure! Sure she will!
She'll do anything!

229
00:16:02,475 --> 00:16:04,306
And I'll come along, too!

230
00:16:04,510 --> 00:16:06,705
Hey, you sure you should?

231
00:16:06,812 --> 00:16:08,439
We may learn who
"Rezo" really is.

232
00:16:08,848 --> 00:16:10,748
Just knowing he's
powerful isn't enough.

233
00:16:10,850 --> 00:16:12,750
With Rezo's collection
of treasure...

234
00:16:12,852 --> 00:16:17,755
I mean spells, we may be able to
find a way to fight this imposter!

235
00:16:17,857 --> 00:16:19,757
Hm, you seem serious, but...

236
00:16:19,859 --> 00:16:22,384
Well, at least she's
honest about her greed.

237
00:16:22,495 --> 00:16:25,692
Okay, it's all settled!
Okay with you, Zelgadis?

238
00:16:26,165 --> 00:16:27,097
Be my guest.

239
00:16:27,199 --> 00:16:30,134
But the old city is a
very dangerous place now.

240
00:16:30,536 --> 00:16:32,436
Be that as it may,
I'm still going.

241
00:16:32,538 --> 00:16:34,529
Right! Let's go
for that treasure!

242
00:16:35,408 --> 00:16:38,844
All I want is to find a way
to turn myself back to normal!

243
00:16:39,245 --> 00:16:44,273
Um, before we go, may I go
back home and tell my father?

244
00:16:44,383 --> 00:16:45,077
Huh?

245
00:16:45,184 --> 00:16:47,778
We have to be careful of
Eris and the others.

246
00:16:47,887 --> 00:16:51,323
And the city guards are
as prevalent as always.

247
00:16:51,424 --> 00:16:53,483
Let's go together when
it's dark, Sylphiel.

248
00:16:53,592 --> 00:16:54,854
Right!

249
00:16:59,865 --> 00:17:00,797
Is it much further?

250
00:17:00,900 --> 00:17:02,527
I can see it!

251
00:17:04,904 --> 00:17:06,132
No way!

252
00:17:17,249 --> 00:17:20,810
We've been waiting! Now give
the Sword of Light to me!

253
00:17:20,920 --> 00:17:23,115
Man, oh man.
You people never give up!

254
00:17:23,222 --> 00:17:25,417
Gourry! This time
we settle things!

255
00:17:25,524 --> 00:17:28,049
You know, you're really
starting to annoy me.

256
00:17:28,260 --> 00:17:29,887
Shut up!

257
00:17:32,932 --> 00:17:37,232
If Gourry's taking him on,
then I'm fighting you!

258
00:17:38,537 --> 00:17:39,663
As you wish.

259
00:17:39,939 --> 00:17:43,170
Zel, wait! You want to fight
in the middle of the city?!

260
00:17:43,275 --> 00:17:47,211
Don't worry! This time I'll
test his powers with one shot!

261
00:18:16,275 --> 00:18:18,266
Why, you...!

262
00:18:19,645 --> 00:18:23,376
I don't know who you really are,
but my righteous blood is boiling!

263
00:18:23,482 --> 00:18:24,506
Your evil shall be...

264
00:18:24,617 --> 00:18:26,050
Shut up and stay out of this!

265
00:18:26,986 --> 00:18:28,453
But I already climbed up here!

266
00:18:33,926 --> 00:18:36,394
Why is Rezo so confident?

267
00:18:36,495 --> 00:18:39,293
Zelgadis is hitting him
with all his power!

268
00:18:48,641 --> 00:18:53,578
You see, my power is far
greater than even this!

269
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:57,980
RUN FOR IT!

270
00:18:58,350 --> 00:19:00,147
Everyone, over here!
You, too, Gourry! Move it!

271
00:19:00,352 --> 00:19:01,284
Huh?! Why?!

272
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:04,521
Retreat, Zangulus!
Retreat if you want to live!

273
00:19:04,623 --> 00:19:06,113
Damn it! To hell with this!

274
00:19:06,625 --> 00:19:08,593
We have to get out of here!
It's almost too late!

275
00:19:08,694 --> 00:19:12,255
- Zel, give us wind!
- Right! A wind barrier!

276
00:19:12,364 --> 00:19:14,332
Wait for me!

277
00:19:14,867 --> 00:19:17,233
Sylphiel, give us a
protection spell from above!

278
00:19:17,303 --> 00:19:17,962
Right!

279
00:19:18,037 --> 00:19:19,299
Amelia, gimme a
levitation spell!

280
00:19:19,371 --> 00:19:20,030
Right!

281
00:19:20,406 --> 00:19:23,000
And I'll reinforce
the wind barrier!

282
00:19:24,710 --> 00:19:27,543
I don't know what the spell does,
but it's serious black magic!

283
00:19:27,646 --> 00:19:29,273
Are we gonna make it?!

284
00:19:44,396 --> 00:19:46,956
How... How could it
be so destructive?!

285
00:20:07,686 --> 00:20:11,383
Was that a Mega Brando?!
No, that's impossible!

286
00:20:12,057 --> 00:20:14,992
It definitely has the
effect of a Mega Brando.

287
00:20:15,094 --> 00:20:17,324
But the magical power
is much, much larger!

288
00:20:17,429 --> 00:20:20,865
Miss Lina! Sairaag is...!

289
00:20:21,700 --> 00:20:23,725
Half the city is gone...

290
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:26,636
Sylphiel!

291
00:20:27,106 --> 00:20:29,165
F- Father...

292
00:20:29,775 --> 00:20:32,073
FATHER!!!

293
00:20:33,779 --> 00:20:36,407
NO!!!

294
00:20:52,097 --> 00:20:55,362
Whether he was real or not
didn't matter now.

295
00:20:55,467 --> 00:20:58,664
The man we were fighting
was unbelievably powerful.

296
00:20:58,771 --> 00:21:02,036
And extraordinarily cruel.

297
00:21:02,141 --> 00:21:04,439
That much was clear.
