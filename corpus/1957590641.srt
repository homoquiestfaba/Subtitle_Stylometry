- Okay, letter I got today.

8
00:02:01,202 --> 00:02:02,751
Dear Mr Spadaccini,

9
00:02:02,752 --> 00:02:05,051
The Tri-State Film Society
is pleased to inform you

10
00:02:05,052 --> 00:02:07,275
that your short film entitled Unstable,

11
00:02:08,282 --> 00:02:11,155
Unstable, the DVD cover art for it,

12
00:02:12,322 --> 00:02:15,711
has won the 2004 Tri-State Film Festival.

13
00:02:15,712 --> 00:02:17,451
As a result of your first place showing,

14
00:02:17,452 --> 00:02:20,521
we're honored to provide with
a $35 thousand scholarship

15
00:02:20,522 --> 00:02:22,665
towards the film school of your choice.

16
00:02:23,952 --> 00:02:24,785
That's very exciting.

17
00:02:24,786 --> 00:02:28,461
So, this weekend, me and several
of my closest friends are

18
00:02:28,462 --> 00:02:32,151
going camping to celebrate

19
00:02:32,152 --> 00:02:34,252
'cause I haven't been camping in years and

20
00:02:35,222 --> 00:02:37,761
they all promised me that if I did win,

21
00:02:37,762 --> 00:02:40,685
they'd take me camping, so
that's what we're doing.

22
00:02:41,557 --> 00:02:42,581
(jars clink)

23
00:02:42,582 --> 00:02:46,501
This is Mr Jim Schaffer,
going through my shit.

24
00:02:46,502 --> 00:02:47,694
What's up, Jim?

25
00:02:47,695 --> 00:02:48,528
- Hey.

26
00:02:48,529 --> 00:02:50,014
- What ya eatin'?

27
00:02:50,015 --> 00:02:51,094
- [Jim] Hot dogs.

28
00:02:51,095 --> 00:02:52,095
- Awesome.

29
00:02:52,889 --> 00:02:54,555
You ready to go camping?

30
00:02:56,972 --> 00:02:58,065
- Eh, yeah.

31
00:02:59,572 --> 00:03:01,381
Where's your knives?

32
00:03:01,382 --> 00:03:03,135
- Right in there, I think.

33
00:03:03,136 --> 00:03:04,415
There was some up there too.

34
00:03:06,056 --> 00:03:06,889
(Jim sighs)

35
00:03:06,890 --> 00:03:08,531
Let's just hope we don't get shot.

36
00:03:08,532 --> 00:03:09,365
- Does this go up or down?

37
00:03:09,366 --> 00:03:10,613
What is this thing?

38
00:03:10,614 --> 00:03:12,893
- I think it's just to
open it, I'm not sure.

39
00:03:12,894 --> 00:03:14,033
(doorbell rings)
(dog barks)

40
00:03:14,034 --> 00:03:16,111
Oh, someone's here.

41
00:03:16,112 --> 00:03:18,901
And who's the first camper to arrive

42
00:03:18,902 --> 00:03:20,355
at our little humble abode?

43
00:03:21,922 --> 00:03:24,097
Bobby, how are you?

44
00:03:24,098 --> 00:03:24,931
- Good, how are you?

45
00:03:24,932 --> 00:03:26,337
- Pretty good.

46
00:03:26,338 --> 00:03:27,505
- That's good.

47
00:03:28,652 --> 00:03:29,752
- Put your stuff down.

48
00:03:31,402 --> 00:03:33,111
Jim, your shit's in the car, right?

49
00:03:33,112 --> 00:03:34,391
- Yeah.

50
00:03:34,392 --> 00:03:35,925
- Bobby, you know Jim, Jim?

51
00:03:39,569 --> 00:03:40,608
- What the fuck's he doing here?

52
00:03:40,609 --> 00:03:41,609
- What?

53
00:03:41,610 --> 00:03:43,201
- What the fuck's he doing here?

54
00:03:43,202 --> 00:03:44,561
- I invited him.

55
00:03:44,562 --> 00:03:45,562
- Why?

56
00:03:46,552 --> 00:03:48,408
- Because he's my friend.

57
00:03:48,409 --> 00:03:49,409
He wanted to go.

58
00:03:50,329 --> 00:03:51,488
Come on, what's wrong?

59
00:03:51,489 --> 00:03:52,568
- Nothing.

60
00:03:52,569 --> 00:03:53,569
- What's wrong?

61
00:03:53,570 --> 00:03:54,768
- Where's your plates?

62
00:03:54,769 --> 00:03:56,318
There we go.

63
00:03:56,319 --> 00:03:57,403
- Jim?
- Hmm?

64
00:03:57,404 --> 00:03:58,237
- Jim, seriously, what's wrong?

65
00:03:58,237 --> 00:03:59,070
- Nothing.

66
00:03:59,071 --> 00:04:00,231
- No, what's wrong?

67
00:04:00,232 --> 00:04:01,241
- I don't want him going.

68
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:02,261
- Why?

69
00:04:02,262 --> 00:04:04,664
- Because I don't like him.

70
00:04:04,665 --> 00:04:06,511
He's a faggot.

71
00:04:06,512 --> 00:04:07,512
- Knock it off.

72
00:04:08,682 --> 00:04:10,151
- Whatever.

73
00:04:10,152 --> 00:04:11,607
- I'm trying to think if I might

74
00:04:11,608 --> 00:04:12,608
want something to eat.

75
00:04:19,072 --> 00:04:20,351
Jim?

76
00:04:20,352 --> 00:04:21,352
- What?

77
00:04:23,431 --> 00:04:24,264
- What's your deal?

78
00:04:24,264 --> 00:04:25,097
- Nothing.

79
00:04:25,097 --> 00:04:26,097
I already told you.

80
00:04:27,752 --> 00:04:28,752
Just drop it.

81
00:04:29,452 --> 00:04:31,790
- Jim, what's your deal?

82
00:04:31,791 --> 00:04:33,270
- Nothing.

83
00:04:33,271 --> 00:04:34,310
You know I don't like him,

84
00:04:34,311 --> 00:04:36,031
I don't like goddamn faggots.

85
00:04:36,032 --> 00:04:38,191
I don't know why he's coming along.

86
00:04:38,192 --> 00:04:39,025
I don't wanna hear it, you know what,

87
00:04:39,026 --> 00:04:40,491
I should probably just
take my shit and go home.

88
00:04:40,492 --> 00:04:41,961
- Jim.

89
00:04:41,962 --> 00:04:44,091
You already promised me that
if I won the film festival

90
00:04:44,092 --> 00:04:44,972
then you'd take me camping.

91
00:04:44,973 --> 00:04:46,871
I won the film festival,

92
00:04:46,872 --> 00:04:47,991
so you hold up your end up the deal.

93
00:04:47,992 --> 00:04:49,292
Alright, I want him going.

94
00:04:50,312 --> 00:04:51,672
Alright, he's not hurting anybody.

95
00:04:52,273 --> 00:04:53,273
- Fine.

96
00:04:54,353 --> 00:04:56,271
- You don't have to be friends but

97
00:04:56,272 --> 00:04:57,275
at least get along.

98
00:04:58,242 --> 00:05:00,022
- I didn't say I wouldn't.

99
00:05:01,699 --> 00:05:03,265
- Whatever, alright, fine.

100
00:05:05,368 --> 00:05:06,445
- Aw, fuck.

101
00:05:07,778 --> 00:05:09,168
(laughing)

102
00:05:09,169 --> 00:05:10,335
Aw, shit.

103
00:05:12,732 --> 00:05:14,369
- Nice going.

104
00:05:14,370 --> 00:05:15,625
- It's on my fat stomach.

105
00:05:20,162 --> 00:05:21,012
Pop the trunk.

106
00:05:21,012 --> 00:05:22,012
- Alright.

107
00:05:24,452 --> 00:05:26,581
Mr. Horace.

108
00:05:26,582 --> 00:05:27,582
Are we tired?

109
00:05:29,495 --> 00:05:31,412
- I ran around all day.

110
00:05:33,562 --> 00:05:34,522
What's all this mess?

111
00:05:34,523 --> 00:05:36,355
- Alright, this is it.

112
00:05:39,982 --> 00:05:42,442
We'll be filming each
and every moment almost.

113
00:05:42,443 --> 00:05:43,842
- Okay.

114
00:05:43,843 --> 00:05:45,176
- Okay, alright.

115
00:05:46,232 --> 00:05:47,232
- Okay.

116
00:05:48,843 --> 00:05:49,941
- Can I go around the side?

117
00:05:49,942 --> 00:05:50,836
- Yeah, sure.

118
00:05:50,836 --> 00:05:51,836
- Okay.

119
00:05:55,724 --> 00:05:56,557
- Can we fit all this?

120
00:05:56,557 --> 00:05:57,557
- I hope so.

121
00:06:02,058 --> 00:06:05,323
- We'll throw that back there (laughs).

122
00:06:05,324 --> 00:06:06,403
- Ah, the important stuff.

123
00:06:06,404 --> 00:06:07,284
- Yeah, booze.

124
00:06:07,284 --> 00:06:08,117
(Jim laughs)

125
00:06:08,117 --> 00:06:09,117
- Exactly.

126
00:06:10,005 --> 00:06:11,644
- The item that's going to
make this weekend bearable.

127
00:06:11,645 --> 00:06:13,281
(Jim laughs)

128
00:06:13,282 --> 00:06:14,655
- How are we gonna do this?

129
00:06:14,656 --> 00:06:15,489
- Fuck you.

130
00:06:15,490 --> 00:06:17,415
(Jim laughs)

131
00:06:17,416 --> 00:06:18,749
- Oh that, okay.

132
00:06:20,983 --> 00:06:21,816
(laughing)

133
00:06:21,817 --> 00:06:23,339
- For me anyway.
- And this.

134
00:06:26,659 --> 00:06:28,159
And this and that.

135
00:06:35,059 --> 00:06:37,642
- [Jim] I don't want him here.

136
00:06:39,930 --> 00:06:42,831
- Unbelievable, you know that?

137
00:06:42,832 --> 00:06:44,041
- [Jim] I'm allowed my opinion.

138
00:06:44,042 --> 00:06:45,082
- Yeah, I know.

139
00:06:46,812 --> 00:06:48,487
Are you gonna be okay?

140
00:06:48,488 --> 00:06:53,488
(inaudible chattering)
(loud whirring)

141
00:06:55,808 --> 00:06:57,247
Just cut the shit.

142
00:06:57,248 --> 00:06:58,767
- [Jim] No.

143
00:06:58,768 --> 00:07:00,464
- Unbelievable.

144
00:07:00,465 --> 00:07:01,894
- [Jim] If you don't
like it, I'll go home.

145
00:07:01,895 --> 00:07:04,710
- This is my weekend, so, no.

146
00:07:04,711 --> 00:07:05,544
- You ready?

147
00:07:05,545 --> 00:07:06,745
- Yeah, we're ready.
- Alright.

148
00:07:08,572 --> 00:07:09,472
- [Anthony] Wade, you know Bobby.

149
00:07:09,473 --> 00:07:10,771
- Yes.

150
00:07:10,772 --> 00:07:14,063
Oh, God, I start falling asleep, so.

151
00:07:14,064 --> 00:07:15,064
- [Anthony] I think we're all gonna be.

152
00:07:15,065 --> 00:07:17,909
It's gonna be an early night tonight...

153
00:07:18,792 --> 00:07:20,238
- Okay.

154
00:07:20,239 --> 00:07:21,431
- Because we'll pick up
Chris early tomorrow.

155
00:07:21,432 --> 00:07:25,055
I gotta go to my grandparents
to get the coolers and

156
00:07:25,056 --> 00:07:26,492
then we'll be on our way.

157
00:07:30,969 --> 00:07:34,765
There's, all the sodas
that are in the bags.

158
00:07:38,299 --> 00:07:41,938
(car ignition rumbles)

159
00:07:41,939 --> 00:07:43,211
- He's got keys to your car?

160
00:07:43,212 --> 00:07:44,212
- Yeah.

161
00:07:59,961 --> 00:08:02,711
(car door thuds)

162
00:08:25,066 --> 00:08:26,066
- We're

163
00:08:28,292 --> 00:08:30,411
taking all this shit
'cause Jim lives down near

164
00:08:30,412 --> 00:08:32,701
where we're camping at, so we're just

165
00:08:32,702 --> 00:08:34,965
giving all the food to
him, so we have more room.

166
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,593
Now Steve, you've met Bobby before, right?

167
00:08:38,594 --> 00:08:39,833
- No, never.

168
00:08:39,834 --> 00:08:41,584
Bobby, I'm Steve, hi.

169
00:08:43,057 --> 00:08:45,467
- [Jim] Anthony (chattering inaudibly)

170
00:08:45,468 --> 00:08:50,468
(inaudible chatter)
(loud engines running)

171
00:08:52,915 --> 00:08:53,915
- He's my buddy.

172
00:08:55,461 --> 00:08:57,368
- We go way back.
- Yeah, way back.

173
00:08:57,369 --> 00:09:00,176
- Way back to what?
- Couple months ago.

174
00:09:00,177 --> 00:09:01,511
(laughing)

175
00:09:01,512 --> 00:09:04,575
- We're a, he's gonna be in
one of my films eventually.

176
00:09:05,582 --> 00:09:08,082
He's already in one, in
another one, a bigger one.

177
00:09:09,717 --> 00:09:11,356
We're gonna do some stage work.

178
00:09:11,357 --> 00:09:14,986
I was tellin' him that my
next things gonna be stage.

179
00:09:14,987 --> 00:09:16,106
- Cool.
- Alright, Anthony,

180
00:09:16,107 --> 00:09:17,466
anything else?
- Is there anything?

181
00:09:17,467 --> 00:09:19,550
- Those bags there, okay.

182
00:09:21,589 --> 00:09:24,839
(loud engines running)

183
00:09:34,025 --> 00:09:36,795
- I hope I get this on Steve's shit.

184
00:09:37,670 --> 00:09:39,920
(whirring)

185
00:09:42,962 --> 00:09:44,112
- [Anthony] Mr Ericson.

186
00:09:46,311 --> 00:09:50,390
- Cool, cool, cool, we
got two good big coolers.

187
00:09:50,391 --> 00:09:52,350
- It's kinda crappy.
- No.

188
00:09:52,351 --> 00:09:53,750
- It works.
- The one my grandparents

189
00:09:53,751 --> 00:09:56,310
gave me, I figured we'd
need an extra one, so.

190
00:09:56,311 --> 00:09:58,478
- There you go.
- So, cool.

191
00:10:00,112 --> 00:10:01,612
You already know Bobby.
- Hi.

192
00:10:02,592 --> 00:10:03,711
(mumbling inaudibly)

193
00:10:03,712 --> 00:10:04,712
- Okay.

194
00:10:05,792 --> 00:10:10,125
(growls)
(whirring)

195
00:10:12,032 --> 00:10:14,351
I'm so excited about this trip.

196
00:10:14,352 --> 00:10:16,952
- It's gonna be fun.
- Yeah it is.

197
00:10:16,953 --> 00:10:19,072
(whirring)

198
00:10:19,073 --> 00:10:20,912
(squealing)

199
00:10:20,913 --> 00:10:22,351
- There is no way.
- There's not.

200
00:10:22,352 --> 00:10:25,479
- Chill.
- There is really no way.

201
00:10:26,473 --> 00:10:28,312
- See I had, I thought we
were gonna take your car.

202
00:10:28,313 --> 00:10:31,632
I was gonna fold my seat down
which has a lot more room.

203
00:10:31,633 --> 00:10:36,383
It's good to, we can take five
people and everything, so.

204
00:10:37,994 --> 00:10:42,753
The only other thing we
can do is put these up top.

205
00:10:42,754 --> 00:10:44,433
- [Anthony] That's what
you were sayin' before.

206
00:10:44,434 --> 00:10:49,434
- Yeah, do you have boots?

207
00:10:50,886 --> 00:10:52,021
- [Bobby] I'm gonna turn off the camera.

208
00:10:52,022 --> 00:10:53,605
- Alright.
- What?

209
00:10:55,302 --> 00:10:59,071
- We packed my sodas.
- Well I didn't pack them.

210
00:10:59,072 --> 00:11:00,781
- Someone packed them so now I have to.

211
00:11:00,782 --> 00:11:02,321
- [Anthony] Oh yeah, the root beer ones.

212
00:11:02,322 --> 00:11:03,698
Yes, I did pack them, I'm sorry.

213
00:11:03,699 --> 00:11:04,582
- I've been looking for those.

214
00:11:04,583 --> 00:11:06,571
- [Anthony] So Steve, you
excited about the camping trip?

215
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:09,259
- Hell no, I wanna go home.
- Okay good.

216
00:11:09,260 --> 00:11:10,093
(laughing)

217
00:11:10,093 --> 00:11:11,093
- [Anthony] Reese.

218
00:11:12,041 --> 00:11:12,874
(barking)

219
00:11:12,874 --> 00:11:13,874
Knock it off.

220
00:11:14,697 --> 00:11:17,530
(engines running)

221
00:11:20,277 --> 00:11:21,701
- Jump to freedom.
- We're getting gas

222
00:11:21,702 --> 00:11:23,445
right now, Reese doesn't know.

223
00:11:24,502 --> 00:11:26,152
- She's trying to escape already.

224
00:11:27,252 --> 00:11:28,976
- [Anthony] Hello.

225
00:11:28,977 --> 00:11:31,976
- Hi.
- What's up?

226
00:11:31,977 --> 00:11:33,644
- Nothin'.
- Hi Wade.

227
00:11:34,817 --> 00:11:36,061
What's up?

228
00:11:36,062 --> 00:11:37,062
- Angle down.

229
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:41,337
- Angle up actually.
- I don't want to.

230
00:11:41,338 --> 00:11:43,062
(wind whipping)

231
00:11:43,063 --> 00:11:46,063
- In my class, there's this Ashlynn.

232
00:11:47,520 --> 00:11:49,480
- [Anthony] Steve's our
chauffeur for the weekend.

233
00:11:50,020 --> 00:11:51,970
- Do I look like Morgan Freeman to you?

234
00:11:53,083 --> 00:11:54,882
I ain't drivin' Miss Daisy.
- Actually.

235
00:11:54,883 --> 00:11:57,133
(laughing)

236
00:11:58,122 --> 00:12:00,495
And we've broken one
law so far on this trip.

237
00:12:01,482 --> 00:12:05,082
- No, no, no, see, when
I was coming down here,

238
00:12:05,083 --> 00:12:07,311
I only did 60 so they owe me five.

239
00:12:07,312 --> 00:12:09,462
So I'm makin' up my five now.

240
00:12:09,463 --> 00:12:12,702
(wind whipping)

241
00:12:12,703 --> 00:12:14,582
- There's no yawning.
- If I wanna yawn,

242
00:12:14,583 --> 00:12:17,224
I'll yawn when I wanna yawn.

243
00:12:17,225 --> 00:12:18,744
- [Anthony] And we're
headed down to the beach.

244
00:12:18,745 --> 00:12:20,744
We're gonna walk the
beach for a little while.

245
00:12:20,745 --> 00:12:22,831
(panting)

246
00:12:22,832 --> 00:12:25,671
That is what you get.
- What'd she do?

247
00:12:25,672 --> 00:12:27,861
- [Anthony] Reese decided to.

248
00:12:27,862 --> 00:12:30,041
- Eat somebody.
- Oh yeah.

249
00:12:30,042 --> 00:12:32,791
- [Man] Lots and lots of sex (mumbles).

250
00:12:32,792 --> 00:12:37,071
- [Anthony] Reese decided
to bark at another dog.

251
00:12:37,072 --> 00:12:39,171
- [Bobby] A giant, a dog bigger than me.

252
00:12:39,172 --> 00:12:41,081
- [Anthony] Yeah, a dog bigger than Bobby.

253
00:12:41,082 --> 00:12:43,611
- Not very big but.
- She's like,

254
00:12:43,612 --> 00:12:47,991
lady's like is your dog
comfortable around other dogs?

255
00:12:47,992 --> 00:12:50,251
I'm like sure, then I'm like wait.

256
00:12:50,252 --> 00:12:52,401
- [Bobby] The other dog
seemed more scared though.

257
00:12:52,402 --> 00:12:53,713
It was like backing off.

258
00:12:53,714 --> 00:12:54,761
- Dude, what the hell.
- Reese, you bully.

259
00:12:54,762 --> 00:12:56,465
Pick on someone your own size.

260
00:12:57,402 --> 00:13:00,073
- Not a.
- Not four times the size.

261
00:13:00,074 --> 00:13:02,641
(laughing)

262
00:13:02,642 --> 00:13:04,777
- [Man] Actually she coughed that up.

263
00:13:04,778 --> 00:13:06,753
- Oh gross.
- Coughed what up?

264
00:13:06,754 --> 00:13:08,594
- [Bobby] It was just two drops.

265
00:13:08,595 --> 00:13:10,801
- [Man] That dog does not need attention.

266
00:13:10,802 --> 00:13:12,854
- [Man] All the sudden she.

267
00:13:12,855 --> 00:13:13,742
This loogie came up.

268
00:13:13,743 --> 00:13:15,382
I didn't know dogs.

269
00:13:16,388 --> 00:13:18,221
- What?
- Dog's hackin'

270
00:13:19,095 --> 00:13:20,705
loogies in the back.

271
00:13:22,348 --> 00:13:24,587
- Sounds like a party.
- Sounds like a party to me.

272
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:26,221
- That's later, we give her beer.

273
00:13:26,222 --> 00:13:27,372
- [Anthony] Mr Shaffer.

274
00:13:31,032 --> 00:13:32,165
Yes he's still coming.

275
00:13:35,172 --> 00:13:37,081
- Tired and I feel like shit.

276
00:13:37,082 --> 00:13:39,615
- Do you?
- He just can't tell time.

277
00:13:40,839 --> 00:13:42,618
(laughing)
(chattering)

278
00:13:42,619 --> 00:13:43,902
- [Man] Hey pup, mine is gone.

279
00:13:45,403 --> 00:13:46,831
Holy shit, holy shit, I've
never been up this high.

280
00:13:46,832 --> 00:13:50,090
- [Anthony] Damn, I missed
it, put her back up there.

281
00:13:50,091 --> 00:13:51,130
- [Man] She's never been up this high.

282
00:13:51,131 --> 00:13:52,847
- [Passenger] No, she was shiverin'.

283
00:13:52,848 --> 00:13:54,884
- [Bobby] You just need
to get her head to bobble.

284
00:13:54,885 --> 00:13:57,111
- [Anthony] We decided
to head to the beach

285
00:13:57,112 --> 00:13:58,651
while we're waiting for Eric.

286
00:13:58,652 --> 00:14:00,041
That's where we are now.

287
00:14:00,042 --> 00:14:02,709
(wind whipping)

288
00:14:05,632 --> 00:14:06,785
James Shaffer.

289
00:14:09,998 --> 00:14:12,917
(inaudible chatter)

290
00:14:12,918 --> 00:14:13,918
- [Man] She's so brave.

291
00:14:13,919 --> 00:14:15,439
(laughing)

292
00:14:15,440 --> 00:14:16,440
- [Man] The dog keeps holdin' me back.

293
00:14:16,440 --> 00:14:17,440
(laughing)

294
00:14:17,440 --> 00:14:18,440
- [Anthony] Where do we wanna eat at, Jim?

295
00:14:18,441 --> 00:14:19,719
- [Bobby] Napoleon syndrome.

296
00:14:19,720 --> 00:14:20,553
That was the term I was tryin' to think of

297
00:14:20,553 --> 00:14:21,432
earlier when I said little man syndrome.

298
00:14:21,432 --> 00:14:22,326
- Napoleon syndrome.
- Well I said it

299
00:14:22,326 --> 00:14:23,326
right after you said that.
- Did you?

300
00:14:23,327 --> 00:14:25,605
- Yeah.
- I wasn't listening to you.

301
00:14:25,606 --> 00:14:27,972
(laughing)

302
00:14:27,973 --> 00:14:29,708
(chatter)

303
00:14:29,709 --> 00:14:33,223
- [Anthony] All I'm saying
is just knock it off.

304
00:14:33,224 --> 00:14:34,781
- Keep his fuckin' mouth shut.

305
00:14:34,782 --> 00:14:36,543
He says one more fuckin' thing to me

306
00:14:36,544 --> 00:14:38,823
and that's gonna be it, that's it.

307
00:14:38,824 --> 00:14:40,571
- [Anthony] You gonna
ruin my weekend because.

308
00:14:40,572 --> 00:14:42,365
- I told you I don't have to be here.

309
00:14:44,642 --> 00:14:46,142
- [Anthony] Jim, knock it off.

310
00:14:48,024 --> 00:14:49,683
- Just keep him away from me.
- What?

311
00:14:49,684 --> 00:14:50,711
- Just keep him away from me.

312
00:14:50,712 --> 00:14:52,061
- [Anthony] He's not
doing anything to you.

313
00:14:52,062 --> 00:14:53,962
- Just keep him away from me.
- Fine.

314
00:14:56,924 --> 00:14:59,283
- I just don't know what
the hell is problem is.

315
00:14:59,284 --> 00:15:00,983
I haven't, I mean, I
don't do anything to him,

316
00:15:00,984 --> 00:15:05,785
offending him in any way
but I'm here for you, so.

317
00:15:05,786 --> 00:15:07,732
- [Anthony] I appreciate that.

318
00:15:08,586 --> 00:15:10,491
- Yeah.
- Just stay away from him.

319
00:15:10,492 --> 00:15:13,209
- I'm tryin', I'm not doin' anything.

320
00:15:15,501 --> 00:15:18,100
- [Anthony] I know, I know you're not.

321
00:15:18,101 --> 00:15:19,101
- Yup.

322
00:15:20,023 --> 00:15:21,323
Try to have a fun weekend.

323
00:15:23,202 --> 00:15:25,341
Maybe I should just try
talkin' to him or somethin'.

324
00:15:25,342 --> 00:15:28,484
- [Anthony] No, no, no, no,
no, just stay away from him.

325
00:15:28,485 --> 00:15:29,485
- Alright.

326
00:15:32,042 --> 00:15:34,895
- Bobby, you okay?
- Yeah, I'm fine.

327
00:15:36,566 --> 00:15:39,101
I'm sorry, I didn't mean
for it be like this.

328
00:15:39,102 --> 00:15:42,585
- It's alright, it's
alright, just one weekend.

329
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:47,231
It won't kill me.
- You don't have to

330
00:15:47,232 --> 00:15:49,461
come with us.
- No, I'm comin' for you.

331
00:15:49,462 --> 00:15:51,009
I told you I'd come.

332
00:15:51,972 --> 00:15:53,091
- [Anthony] I can drop you off.

333
00:15:53,092 --> 00:15:57,241
It's no big deal, I don't wanna
see you subjected to this.

334
00:15:57,242 --> 00:15:59,945
- It's alright, I'll just bear with it.

335
00:16:01,391 --> 00:16:02,821
- Just stay away from him.
- Yeah I know.

336
00:16:02,822 --> 00:16:04,125
- [Anthony] I'll work on him.

337
00:16:08,591 --> 00:16:10,030
- [Bobby] So did you see that?

338
00:16:10,031 --> 00:16:11,002
- What?
- He just took the dog

339
00:16:11,003 --> 00:16:14,135
from me.
(random chattering)

340
00:16:19,062 --> 00:16:20,691
- [Anthony] Stevens.

341
00:16:20,692 --> 00:16:21,972
(groans)

342
00:16:21,973 --> 00:16:23,451
- Oh god.
- You alright?

343
00:16:23,452 --> 00:16:24,452
- Yeah.

344
00:16:25,132 --> 00:16:26,641
Hello, what's Jim's deal with Bobby?

345
00:16:26,642 --> 00:16:28,801
Something you oughta tell me.

346
00:16:28,802 --> 00:16:30,602
- [Anthony] No, I don't
know what the deal is.

347
00:16:31,413 --> 00:16:34,199
- Maybe I'll just jump.
- Oh.

348
00:16:34,200 --> 00:16:35,033
- You saw that too.
- Yeah, I saw it.

349
00:16:35,034 --> 00:16:37,151
Somethin's not right there.

350
00:16:37,152 --> 00:16:39,325
- [Anthony] I, Jim knew he was coming.

351
00:16:40,302 --> 00:16:41,262
Bobby's not hurting anybody.

352
00:16:41,263 --> 00:16:43,141
- Is there a problem between them?

353
00:16:43,142 --> 00:16:44,142
- [Anthony] I.

354
00:16:45,922 --> 00:16:49,851
I, Jim has his theories and whatnot.

355
00:16:49,852 --> 00:16:50,852
I'm just.
- Man,

356
00:16:51,682 --> 00:16:52,771
he's bein' a real dick though.

357
00:16:52,772 --> 00:16:54,921
- [Anthony] I know he is, I know.

358
00:16:54,922 --> 00:16:56,522
Let's just try to bear with him.

359
00:16:57,533 --> 00:16:58,841
- It's not gonna be like this
the whole weekend, is it?

360
00:16:58,842 --> 00:17:00,245
- [Anthony] I certainly hope not.

361
00:17:02,572 --> 00:17:03,622
I certainly hope not.

362
00:17:05,633 --> 00:17:07,032
- Up here.
- Yeah, it's up on

363
00:17:07,033 --> 00:17:09,892
this on this side.
- Chills.

364
00:17:09,893 --> 00:17:11,492
- [Steve] It might be on this side.

365
00:17:11,493 --> 00:17:15,192
- [Man] Hey, can you hand
me my white sweatshirt?

366
00:17:15,193 --> 00:17:18,026
(engines running)

367
00:17:32,215 --> 00:17:34,554
(inaudible singing)

368
00:17:34,555 --> 00:17:37,638
- [Anthony] Hey, we got a flashlight.

369
00:17:40,215 --> 00:17:42,034
(engines running loudly over chatter)

370
00:17:42,035 --> 00:17:43,634
- Right in here.
- Alright.

371
00:17:43,635 --> 00:17:44,964
- It's pretty thick.
- Call that home.

372
00:17:44,965 --> 00:17:45,837
- Okay.
- So.

373
00:17:45,838 --> 00:17:50,837
- [Man] I just put on
(mumbles), it's not working.

374
00:17:51,011 --> 00:17:51,972
- [Anthony] Alright Eric,
introduce you to everyone.

375
00:17:51,973 --> 00:17:54,431
This is Steve.
- Eric, how are you?

376
00:17:54,432 --> 00:17:55,941
Good to meet ya.
- This is Wade.

377
00:17:55,942 --> 00:17:57,381
- How you doin', man?
- Wade.

378
00:17:57,382 --> 00:18:01,279
- Bobby, Chris.
- Chris.

379
00:18:02,142 --> 00:18:03,561
- Chris is on the camera.
- Who's the dog?

380
00:18:03,562 --> 00:18:05,212
- [Man] My mom's dog, Reese Puff.

381
00:18:07,182 --> 00:18:10,741
- Reese Puff.
- Like Reese cones.

382
00:18:10,742 --> 00:18:12,421
- [Anthony] Don't get
close to it, it's evil.

383
00:18:12,422 --> 00:18:15,963
- [Man] How much time, Chris,
is left on the battery?

384
00:18:15,964 --> 00:18:19,123
(random chattering inaudibly)

385
00:18:19,124 --> 00:18:21,207
(groans)

386
00:18:27,324 --> 00:18:29,363
- [Woman] She ain't doin' anything.

387
00:18:29,364 --> 00:18:34,364
(inaudible chattering)
(crickets chirping)

388
00:18:38,684 --> 00:18:39,863
(laughing)

389
00:18:39,864 --> 00:18:41,471
How many people does it
take to set up a tent,

390
00:18:41,472 --> 00:18:43,699
quite a few.
- It's recording.

391
00:18:45,064 --> 00:18:46,561
- This is not firewood.
- Yeah, we know.

392
00:18:46,562 --> 00:18:48,485
No, we were gonna sit on it.

393
00:18:48,486 --> 00:18:49,805
- Huh?
- We were gonna sit on it.

394
00:18:49,806 --> 00:18:50,806
- [Anthony] So we've got a big fire

395
00:18:50,807 --> 00:18:52,505
and burning grass around it.
- That's why I brought

396
00:18:52,506 --> 00:18:54,265
it over.
- Great sign.

397
00:18:54,266 --> 00:18:55,585
We're gonna have a killer weekend.

398
00:18:55,586 --> 00:18:57,026
- I brought enough chairs.
- Oh okay.

399
00:18:58,191 --> 00:18:59,605
- Yeah, there's more over there.

400
00:18:59,606 --> 00:19:01,045
- [Steve] Downwind, up wind I mean.

401
00:19:01,046 --> 00:19:02,046
- [Anthony] That's where all
the mosquitoes are though.

402
00:19:02,047 --> 00:19:04,347
- That's alright, I'd
rather be bit by mosquitoes

403
00:19:04,348 --> 00:19:06,947
than have an asthma attack.

404
00:19:06,948 --> 00:19:08,147
- Gotcha.
- Okay.

405
00:19:08,148 --> 00:19:13,148
(inaudible chattering)
(fire crackling)

406
00:19:15,181 --> 00:19:16,817
- [Anthony] Check out
all that burning grass.

407
00:19:16,818 --> 00:19:18,737
(fire crackling)

408
00:19:18,738 --> 00:19:20,258
- [Man] Yeah, I don't like doin' this.

409
00:19:21,938 --> 00:19:22,938
- It's out of control.
- Hopefully that's not

410
00:19:22,939 --> 00:19:27,938
us in the morning.
(crackling)

411
00:19:36,082 --> 00:19:37,901
- [Man] Just takes you,
that's weird, Barry.

412
00:19:37,902 --> 00:19:39,491
(inaudible chattering)

413
00:19:39,492 --> 00:19:40,611
- [Anthony] Now I can see everybody.

414
00:19:40,612 --> 00:19:42,221
It's like a forum.

415
00:19:42,222 --> 00:19:44,984
- Dude, I didn't tell you to sit there.

416
00:19:44,985 --> 00:19:46,783
- You get more exercise.
- I have the camera.

417
00:19:46,784 --> 00:19:47,617
(laughing)

418
00:19:47,618 --> 00:19:49,018
- God, give me a break.
- What's up?

419
00:19:50,182 --> 00:19:52,571
- [Anthony] Chillin'
out, designated driver

420
00:19:52,572 --> 00:19:55,172
in case we need to drive
away from this death flame.

421
00:19:56,318 --> 00:19:58,151
- Yeah we do.
- Oh god.

422
00:19:59,206 --> 00:20:01,005
(crackling)

423
00:20:01,006 --> 00:20:02,006
- [Anthony] Turn it back a little bit

424
00:20:02,007 --> 00:20:04,805
and then turn a couple flicks again.

425
00:20:04,806 --> 00:20:07,306
- What about lights?
- I thought it was that one.

426
00:20:09,886 --> 00:20:12,006
- Reese.
- I think Dan knows.

427
00:20:12,007 --> 00:20:15,461
(inaudible chattering)

428
00:20:15,462 --> 00:20:18,006
- [Anthony] So Wade, you
enjoying yourself so far?

429
00:20:18,007 --> 00:20:20,006
- Definitely.
- Huh?

430
00:20:20,007 --> 00:20:23,086
- Definitely.
- What's wrong with you?

431
00:20:23,087 --> 00:20:25,006
(laughing)

432
00:20:25,007 --> 00:20:27,046
- [Man] Hi Steve.
(laughing)

433
00:20:27,047 --> 00:20:28,686
- [Man] Insert the gas
on and hold it over fire.

434
00:20:28,687 --> 00:20:31,287
(laughing)

435
00:20:31,288 --> 00:20:33,607
- [Anthony] Hi Amy.

436
00:20:33,608 --> 00:20:35,008
- Blow up.
- What's up Amy?

437
00:20:36,608 --> 00:20:37,482
- Oh, hello, I was scratchin' my head.

438
00:20:37,483 --> 00:20:39,647
- [Anthony] Let me see two
thumbs up or one thumb up.

439
00:20:39,648 --> 00:20:43,367
- Yeah.
- Woo!

440
00:20:43,368 --> 00:20:45,618
(laughing)

441
00:20:46,488 --> 00:20:48,821
(crackling)

442
00:20:50,472 --> 00:20:52,808
By the way, I have pictures from your

443
00:20:52,809 --> 00:20:54,551
21st birthday party.
- Anybody want anything?

444
00:20:54,552 --> 00:20:57,237
- Oh do you?
- Where you goin'?

445
00:20:57,238 --> 00:20:58,238
- [Amy] Which I don't
think you've seen yet.

446
00:20:58,239 --> 00:20:59,757
- [Anthony] No, I try
to forget that night.

447
00:20:59,758 --> 00:21:00,758
(laughing)

448
00:21:00,758 --> 00:21:01,591
- Don't blame ya.
- Don't feel bad.

449
00:21:01,592 --> 00:21:03,681
I doubt Eric remembers very much of it.

450
00:21:03,682 --> 00:21:04,818
- Why?
- I think he does.

451
00:21:04,819 --> 00:21:06,579
- His 21st birthday party.
- Oh.

452
00:21:07,798 --> 00:21:09,677
- Very much.
- I was gonna say.

453
00:21:09,678 --> 00:21:12,437
- Do you remember I took
six of us to carry your ass?

454
00:21:12,438 --> 00:21:13,917
- Ain't nobody carried my ass.

455
00:21:13,918 --> 00:21:16,037
- [Anthony] No that was
the night, that was, Jim,

456
00:21:16,038 --> 00:21:19,199
that was my 19th birthday party.

457
00:21:19,200 --> 00:21:20,479
- It wasn't me.
- That was you.

458
00:21:20,480 --> 00:21:22,259
It was 19th birthday party but it was you.

459
00:21:22,260 --> 00:21:24,299
- That wasn't them.
- Yeah, it was you.

460
00:21:24,300 --> 00:21:25,699
- Okay.
- His 21st.

461
00:21:25,700 --> 00:21:26,979
- What was the 21st?
- Was.

462
00:21:26,980 --> 00:21:29,961
- Baxters.
- I was pissed at you.

463
00:21:29,962 --> 00:21:31,321
- [Jim] What were you pissed at me for?

464
00:21:31,322 --> 00:21:34,834
- [Amy] You took off and left us there.

465
00:21:34,835 --> 00:21:35,835
- Because, yeah.
- We, we left.

466
00:21:35,835 --> 00:21:36,835
- Yeah.
- Mike and I left

467
00:21:36,835 --> 00:21:37,835
and came back.
- Yeah.

468
00:21:37,836 --> 00:21:39,174
You took like three hours.

469
00:21:39,175 --> 00:21:40,721
- Where the hell did we go?
- You went to wash

470
00:21:40,722 --> 00:21:42,721
fucking clothes or some dumb shit.

471
00:21:42,722 --> 00:21:46,829
- Wow.
- I was ready to kill you.

472
00:21:46,830 --> 00:21:48,869
(laughing)

473
00:21:48,870 --> 00:21:51,203
(crackling)

474
00:21:54,782 --> 00:21:55,712
- [Anthony] Somebody
should've brought a guitar.

475
00:21:55,713 --> 00:21:57,592
We could sing campfire songs.

476
00:21:57,593 --> 00:21:59,312
- [Steve] I guess your
battery's dying, huh.

477
00:21:59,313 --> 00:22:00,672
- No.
- I know a bunch

478
00:22:00,673 --> 00:22:02,032
of nursery rhymes if that helps anything.

479
00:22:02,033 --> 00:22:03,152
- On my camera.
- It's just something

480
00:22:03,153 --> 00:22:04,472
so I can fly or find it.
- Okay.

481
00:22:04,473 --> 00:22:06,352
- I know my ABCs.
- Oh, oh.

482
00:22:06,353 --> 00:22:07,712
- [Amy] And one two threes.

483
00:22:07,713 --> 00:22:09,432
♪ Kumbaya my Lord ♪

484
00:22:09,433 --> 00:22:10,712
- [Anthony] That's when you get hit.

485
00:22:10,713 --> 00:22:12,073
(laughing)

486
00:22:12,074 --> 00:22:15,041
(crackling)

487
00:22:15,042 --> 00:22:16,032
- [Amy] What about Mary Had A Little Lamb.

488
00:22:16,033 --> 00:22:18,353
Is that one okay?
- Depends if

489
00:22:18,354 --> 00:22:20,725
you like the fire.
(laughing)

490
00:22:21,642 --> 00:22:22,901
- Jack be nimble, Jack be quick

491
00:22:22,902 --> 00:22:24,353
Jack jumped over the fire

492
00:22:24,354 --> 00:22:25,829
- Fire.
- Stick.

493
00:22:27,452 --> 00:22:29,501
- Wait, that doesn't rhyme.
- You ended with pit.

494
00:22:29,502 --> 00:22:32,636
That's fine.
- No, his 19th birthday

495
00:22:32,637 --> 00:22:35,421
somebody was makin' screwdrivers,
I don't know what they

496
00:22:35,422 --> 00:22:37,551
were but they had more vodka
than orange juice in 'em.

497
00:22:37,552 --> 00:22:38,996
- Oh god.
- You say that

498
00:22:38,997 --> 00:22:40,596
like it's a bad thing.
- No.

499
00:22:40,597 --> 00:22:42,596
- [Man] Kinda like your blood stream.

500
00:22:42,597 --> 00:22:43,881
- Yeah, I had alcohol, I had blood

501
00:22:43,882 --> 00:22:46,398
in my alcohol stream.
(laughing)

502
00:22:46,399 --> 00:22:47,671
And it was.
- You should never

503
00:22:47,672 --> 00:22:48,919
mix those two.
(laughing)

504
00:22:48,920 --> 00:22:51,679
(chattering)

505
00:22:51,680 --> 00:22:53,350
- Or was that another night?
- It was so funny.

506
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,239
Eric was so trashed, it wasn't.

507
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:56,073
- I know you didn't know me.
- I passed out on the couch.

508
00:22:56,074 --> 00:22:57,571
They moved the couch with me on it.

509
00:22:57,572 --> 00:22:58,911
- Oh shit.
- 'Cause it was

510
00:22:58,912 --> 00:23:00,712
easier than tryin' to move just him.

511
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:02,840
Because he had no muscle tone.

512
00:23:04,040 --> 00:23:06,080
- [Man] Just pick up the couch, fuck it.

513
00:23:06,081 --> 00:23:07,520
Dead weight.
- They pissed me off.

514
00:23:07,521 --> 00:23:08,521
They wouldn't let me barf in peace.

515
00:23:08,521 --> 00:23:09,521
They kept openin' the
fuckin' bathroom door.

516
00:23:09,521 --> 00:23:10,521
(laughing)

517
00:23:10,521 --> 00:23:11,521
- Okay.
- How much time lapsed

518
00:23:11,522 --> 00:23:13,171
before you realized you
were in the bathroom?

519
00:23:13,172 --> 00:23:16,621
- I knew I was fucked up.
- I remember at one point,

520
00:23:16,622 --> 00:23:20,421
you were somethin' with Anthony
and you were on the phone

521
00:23:20,422 --> 00:23:22,761
with me and you were
barfin' in the bathroom.

522
00:23:22,762 --> 00:23:25,241
- That was out.
- The car.

523
00:23:25,242 --> 00:23:28,241
- That things from, oh my.
- We did a lot of (mumbles)

524
00:23:28,242 --> 00:23:32,815
with my parents so yes.

525
00:23:33,682 --> 00:23:36,121
We haven't camped in this

526
00:23:36,122 --> 00:23:37,641
(laughing)

527
00:23:37,642 --> 00:23:39,221
It's only, it's an older camper but.

528
00:23:39,222 --> 00:23:41,044
- It's new to you.
- Yeah.

529
00:23:41,045 --> 00:23:43,962
- It looks brand new inside.
- Yeah.

530
00:23:45,132 --> 00:23:46,391
- The two, there's two curtains in there

531
00:23:46,392 --> 00:23:50,171
that need to be fixed but other than that.

532
00:23:50,172 --> 00:23:51,722
- What's up Eric?
- What's up?

533
00:23:54,052 --> 00:23:57,051
- [Anthony] We kinda
finished it but it was,

534
00:23:57,052 --> 00:24:00,007
we had a bunch of footage, we
just kinda edited together.

535
00:24:00,008 --> 00:24:01,567
- Oh that's right.
- Oh that's you.

536
00:24:01,568 --> 00:24:02,401
(laughing)

537
00:24:02,402 --> 00:24:03,741
- [Anthony] Yeah she's
the one that was sitting

538
00:24:03,742 --> 00:24:06,671
there with Jeff and the corn
chips laughin' as Rob got shot.

539
00:24:06,672 --> 00:24:07,751
- [Man] Yeah the corn chips were all

540
00:24:07,752 --> 00:24:10,567
the kicker of the whole thing.
- Yeah.

541
00:24:10,568 --> 00:24:12,887
- Everywhere they went the corn chips.

542
00:24:12,888 --> 00:24:14,608
- I have yet to see that.
- Right, huh?

543
00:24:14,609 --> 00:24:15,442
- You have that with you?
- No I don't.

544
00:24:15,443 --> 00:24:16,861
I have a copy for Eric at home.

545
00:24:16,862 --> 00:24:18,848
- I wanna see that.
- We're gonna get more wood.

546
00:24:18,849 --> 00:24:22,768
- Okay.
- Get a lot.

547
00:24:22,769 --> 00:24:24,401
- I got it.
- No.

548
00:24:24,402 --> 00:24:27,848
- Dude, sit down.
- Jim.

549
00:24:27,849 --> 00:24:30,968
- Gonna be a little asshole.
- Jim, Jim.

550
00:24:30,969 --> 00:24:33,121
- What?
- What the fuck are you doin'?

551
00:24:33,122 --> 00:24:35,409
He coulda tripped.
- I got it.

552
00:24:35,410 --> 00:24:38,155
I don't need his help.
- Yeah, I'm gonna get wood.

553
00:24:39,672 --> 00:24:41,685
See you guys, where's my flashlight?

554
00:24:45,570 --> 00:24:47,769
- What do you think you're doin'?

555
00:24:47,770 --> 00:24:49,171
- Getting a s'more.

556
00:24:49,172 --> 00:24:53,922
(crackling)
(chattering)

557
00:25:07,092 --> 00:25:09,015
- What now?
- I don't care.

558
00:25:10,422 --> 00:25:11,422
- [Bobby] Alright then.

559
00:25:14,538 --> 00:25:16,561
- If you haven't figured it out yet,

560
00:25:16,562 --> 00:25:18,777
I don't want you talkin' to me.

561
00:25:18,778 --> 00:25:23,137
- Messed up, dude.
- Guys, knock it off.

562
00:25:23,138 --> 00:25:26,778
Both of you, knock it off.

563
00:25:26,779 --> 00:25:29,696
- [Bobby] I wanted fucking S'mores.

564
00:25:30,539 --> 00:25:32,178
- [Man] I thought we
were havin' a great time.

565
00:25:32,179 --> 00:25:33,179
(laughing)

566
00:25:33,180 --> 00:25:35,578
- Eatin' people.
- Eatin' S'mores too.

567
00:25:35,579 --> 00:25:37,938
(laughing)

568
00:25:37,939 --> 00:25:39,418
- I need.
- I mean,

569
00:25:39,419 --> 00:25:41,378
it's not my choice but
to each his own, ya know.

570
00:25:41,379 --> 00:25:42,631
- [Jim] Your boy's
fuckin' get on my nerves.

571
00:25:42,632 --> 00:25:43,731
- Why?
- Because

572
00:25:43,732 --> 00:25:45,014
I just don't want him
fuckin' talkin' to me.

573
00:25:45,015 --> 00:25:48,295
Just leave, ya know, I better
push him in that fuckin' fire.

574
00:25:50,782 --> 00:25:53,259
- Jimmy's not doin' anything to you.

575
00:25:53,260 --> 00:25:56,899
- He's just coming around me,
I don't want him around me.

576
00:25:56,900 --> 00:25:57,733
I don't want him talkin' to me.

577
00:25:57,734 --> 00:26:00,660
I don't want him within an arm reach

578
00:26:00,661 --> 00:26:03,620
or I can't be responsible
for what I'm gonna do.

579
00:26:03,621 --> 00:26:05,251
- Jim, he's not doing anything to you.

580
00:26:05,252 --> 00:26:07,111
He's here for me.
- Okay, that's fine.

581
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:09,895
Then he can be around
you, just drop it, okay.

582
00:26:11,792 --> 00:26:13,105
- [Anthony] You wanna go home?

583
00:26:14,981 --> 00:26:16,881
- If this shit keeps up, I just might.

584
00:26:19,192 --> 00:26:23,671
(crackling)
(chattering)

585
00:26:23,672 --> 00:26:26,432
- [Man] Once a month, wow.

586
00:26:26,433 --> 00:26:29,683
(inaudible chattering)

587
00:26:32,792 --> 00:26:34,931
Every two months.

588
00:26:34,932 --> 00:26:36,781
- [Anthony] You promised me
you would take me camping

589
00:26:36,782 --> 00:26:38,973
if I won this festival,
I won the festival.

590
00:26:38,974 --> 00:26:39,952
- [Jim] You won the festival, we're here.

591
00:26:39,953 --> 00:26:41,651
- [Anthony] Yeah we're
here and you're making

592
00:26:41,652 --> 00:26:43,171
it miserable for everyone else.

593
00:26:43,172 --> 00:26:45,423
- [Jim] No, everyone else
is having a good time

594
00:26:45,424 --> 00:26:47,815
from what I can see.
(crackling)

595
00:26:55,144 --> 00:26:58,703
The fuck you doin'?
- I just need a drink.

596
00:26:58,704 --> 00:27:02,037
- Are they yours?
- They're for everyone.

597
00:27:04,306 --> 00:27:06,405
- Get the fuck away you
pimple faced faggot.

598
00:27:06,406 --> 00:27:09,107
(clanging)

599
00:27:09,108 --> 00:27:10,108
- Asshole.

600
00:27:11,308 --> 00:27:12,827
- [Wade] Yeah man, chill
out man, seriously.

601
00:27:12,828 --> 00:27:16,055
He's just gettin' a drink, you alright?

602
00:27:17,544 --> 00:27:19,584
- I'm fine now that he's not around me.

603
00:27:19,585 --> 00:27:20,761
- Why you bein' such a dick?

604
00:27:20,762 --> 00:27:24,621
- 'Cause I can be.
- Well, you don't have to be.

605
00:27:24,622 --> 00:27:26,111
- This is an a and b conversation.

606
00:27:26,112 --> 00:27:27,872
So see your way out of it.
- Yeah.

607
00:27:27,873 --> 00:27:29,632
Stop being a little bitch.

608
00:27:29,633 --> 00:27:30,792
- You got your bitch right here.

609
00:27:30,793 --> 00:27:33,654
- [Wade] Whatever man.

610
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:36,391
Whatever man, you wish.
- Yo, yo, yo.

611
00:27:36,392 --> 00:27:39,611
You both need to chill
out, alright, come on.

612
00:27:39,612 --> 00:27:41,891
We're out here to have
a good time, chill out.

613
00:27:41,892 --> 00:27:43,451
- I'm just tellin' you to
chill the fuck out, man.

614
00:27:43,452 --> 00:27:44,561
Have another drink and chill out.

615
00:27:44,562 --> 00:27:47,751
Yo Ant, no offense but I
know he's your boy and all.

616
00:27:47,752 --> 00:27:49,891
But seriously man, he has
to chill out with that shit.

617
00:27:49,892 --> 00:27:51,361
I mean, this is supposed
to be your weekend.

618
00:27:51,362 --> 00:27:52,871
And we're supposed to
be celebrating your like

619
00:27:52,872 --> 00:27:55,892
prize and everything and
I mean, we don't need

620
00:27:55,893 --> 00:27:56,726
the fuckin' negativity, seriously.

621
00:27:56,727 --> 00:27:58,572
- We don't need that stuff.

622
00:27:58,573 --> 00:27:59,772
- Seriously, I mean if he has a problem.

623
00:27:59,773 --> 00:28:01,492
- What'd I do?
- It's not you man.

624
00:28:01,493 --> 00:28:03,021
It's not you, it's your boy, Jims.

625
00:28:03,022 --> 00:28:04,111
I mean, I know he's your boy and all,

626
00:28:04,112 --> 00:28:05,611
you grew up with him but
shit, we don't have to

627
00:28:05,612 --> 00:28:08,441
deal with that shit, I mean,
we're here for you, seriously.

628
00:28:08,442 --> 00:28:10,492
- I know, I know.
- I mean,

629
00:28:10,493 --> 00:28:11,362
I don't know what his
problem with Bobby is.

630
00:28:11,363 --> 00:28:13,791
But he needs to chill with that shit.

631
00:28:13,792 --> 00:28:15,293
- [Anthony] Why don't you tell him that?

632
00:28:15,294 --> 00:28:16,373
He won't listen to me.

633
00:28:16,374 --> 00:28:17,431
- Dude, you just heard
our conversation, man.

634
00:28:17,432 --> 00:28:18,451
He told me to see my way out of it.

635
00:28:18,452 --> 00:28:20,381
I told him stop being a little bitch.

636
00:28:20,382 --> 00:28:21,382
- And I'm not doin' anything 'cause

637
00:28:21,383 --> 00:28:23,174
he's in the same tent as me, so.

638
00:28:23,175 --> 00:28:24,092
(laughing)

639
00:28:24,093 --> 00:28:26,034
- Fuck him up when he's sleep.

640
00:28:26,035 --> 00:28:27,051
(laughing)

641
00:28:27,052 --> 00:28:29,431
No serious though,
we're your boys and all.

642
00:28:29,432 --> 00:28:32,214
But I mean.
- I don't know.

643
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:34,201
- You invited us all here and
if he has a problem with it,

644
00:28:34,202 --> 00:28:36,251
tell him to go fuck off, he
can go home for all I care.

645
00:28:36,252 --> 00:28:37,521
- And if he does have
to leave, I don't care

646
00:28:37,522 --> 00:28:39,951
'cause then I get the tent to myself.

647
00:28:39,952 --> 00:28:41,541
- Wait, isn't that his tent?

648
00:28:41,542 --> 00:28:43,198
- I'll take it.
(laughing)

649
00:28:43,199 --> 00:28:44,811
- And the bed, I don't give a shit.

650
00:28:44,812 --> 00:28:48,071
- But seriously man, I don't know.

651
00:28:48,072 --> 00:28:51,556
Maybe just, you need to talk
to him or somethin', alright.

652
00:28:51,557 --> 00:28:52,856
- I don't know.
- Seriously.

653
00:28:52,857 --> 00:28:53,931
- Vote him off the island.
- I mean, he's your boy.

654
00:28:53,932 --> 00:28:55,271
You've known him the
longest, I don't know him.

655
00:28:55,272 --> 00:28:57,276
I just met him this weekend, so.

656
00:28:57,277 --> 00:28:58,548
- And I have no idea who
the fuck any of you are, so.

657
00:28:58,549 --> 00:29:00,211
Except for you.
- I was gettin' ready

658
00:29:00,212 --> 00:29:01,916
to say dude, we grew up with each other.

659
00:29:01,917 --> 00:29:03,036
What are you talkin' about?

660
00:29:03,037 --> 00:29:03,870
(laughing)

661
00:29:03,871 --> 00:29:05,201
You invite us all out
here to have a good time

662
00:29:05,202 --> 00:29:07,331
to celebrate you man, and
that's what we're tryin' to do.

663
00:29:07,332 --> 00:29:09,251
He's the only one bringin'
us down so fuck that.

664
00:29:09,252 --> 00:29:10,834
We should not have to
deal with that bullshit.

665
00:29:10,835 --> 00:29:12,111
- [Anthony] I've been
hearing this all night.

666
00:29:12,112 --> 00:29:14,338
I realize this.
- Yeah, but.

667
00:29:14,339 --> 00:29:15,778
I'm sorry, can I help you?

668
00:29:15,779 --> 00:29:16,818
- [Jim] You have a fuckin' problem?

669
00:29:16,819 --> 00:29:17,712
- Yo, man.
- Jim, Jim sit down.

670
00:29:17,713 --> 00:29:19,674
- [Wade] Like you said before,
it's an a b conversation.

671
00:29:19,675 --> 00:29:21,218
- [Anthony] Jim, Jim,
Wade, come on, separate.

672
00:29:21,219 --> 00:29:23,291
- And your point is?

673
00:29:23,292 --> 00:29:25,241
- Don't fuck around your
mouth behind my back.

674
00:29:25,242 --> 00:29:26,651
- Get out of my face.
- Come on, come on, come on.

675
00:29:26,652 --> 00:29:28,371
- Knock it off.
- Come on Jim.

676
00:29:28,372 --> 00:29:29,861
- Knock it off.
- Jim, come on.

677
00:29:29,862 --> 00:29:31,938
- Shut the fuck up.
- Come on.

678
00:29:31,939 --> 00:29:34,059
- [Wade] Man, you don't know
me like that so fuck you.

679
00:29:34,419 --> 00:29:35,881
- Come on, Wade, stay the goal, alright.

680
00:29:35,882 --> 00:29:38,540
- I'm sayin' I punch him in
the shit, I don't give a fuck.

681
00:29:38,541 --> 00:29:39,811
- [Steve] Why are you guys
actin' like a bunch of babies?

682
00:29:39,812 --> 00:29:41,375
- Seriously man.
- Come on.

683
00:29:42,845 --> 00:29:44,044
- [Wade] I'm just tellin' you
to chill and have a good time.

684
00:29:44,045 --> 00:29:45,164
- We're out here to
have a good time, right?

685
00:29:45,165 --> 00:29:45,998
- Shut the fuck up.
- Come on guys, Jesus.

686
00:29:45,998 --> 00:29:46,962
- [Wade] Because you're being a dick.

687
00:29:46,963 --> 00:29:48,911
- It's over, it's over.
- There's nothin' to

688
00:29:48,912 --> 00:29:50,004
be over about, stop being a dick.

689
00:29:50,005 --> 00:29:51,005
That's all I'm tellin' you to do.

690
00:29:51,005 --> 00:29:51,838
- I'm not bein' a dick to you.

691
00:29:51,839 --> 00:29:53,004
- You're both bein' dicks right now.

692
00:29:53,005 --> 00:29:55,001
- [Wade] Why you bein'
a dick to Bobby, then?

693
00:29:55,002 --> 00:29:56,071
- Come on.
- Why you bein' a dick

694
00:29:56,072 --> 00:29:57,325
to Bobby, yeah.
- Are you Bobby?

695
00:29:57,326 --> 00:29:58,721
- [Wade] It doesn't matter.

696
00:29:58,722 --> 00:29:59,911
Why you being a dick to Bobby?

697
00:29:59,912 --> 00:30:01,812
The rest of us have to hear this shit.

698
00:30:04,052 --> 00:30:07,001
- [Anthony] You're making
quite a few enemies here.

699
00:30:07,002 --> 00:30:08,681
And we've been out for what, three hours.

700
00:30:08,682 --> 00:30:10,751
- Tell people to just mind
their own fuckin' business.

701
00:30:10,752 --> 00:30:13,087
- [Anthony] You're kinda bein' loud.

702
00:30:13,088 --> 00:30:14,488
Did you ever think about that?

703
00:30:14,489 --> 00:30:15,489
- [Wade] I don't know you.

704
00:30:15,490 --> 00:30:17,008
I don't know you that well
but it don't bother me.

705
00:30:17,009 --> 00:30:17,842
- You don't like it, don't listen.

706
00:30:17,843 --> 00:30:19,388
- [Anthony] Well it's kinda my trip.

707
00:30:19,389 --> 00:30:20,222
- [Wade] And I know two gay people.

708
00:30:20,222 --> 00:30:21,055
They're in my class.
- I can leave.

709
00:30:21,056 --> 00:30:23,551
- [Anthony] I don't, why can't
you just get along with him

710
00:30:23,552 --> 00:30:27,081
and with Wade, everyone just
wants to have a good time?

711
00:30:27,082 --> 00:30:28,325
Can't you tolerate?

712
00:30:30,622 --> 00:30:32,887
- As long as he just keeps his distance.

713
00:30:32,888 --> 00:30:35,727
- [Anthony] Well he's
sitting next to you now.

714
00:30:35,728 --> 00:30:37,728
So why don't you keep
your distance from him?

715
00:30:37,729 --> 00:30:39,689
- I don't want him any
closer than an arm's reach.

716
00:30:41,662 --> 00:30:43,265
- [Anthony] I'm sorry, I just.

717
00:30:45,849 --> 00:30:47,691
- Just drop it.
- I can't drop it.

718
00:30:47,692 --> 00:30:50,134
I see you two fuckin'
arguing all the time.

719
00:30:50,135 --> 00:30:52,688
- [Man] Cut his fuckin' head off.

720
00:30:52,689 --> 00:30:54,409
- As long as he doesn't
come near me, we're fine.

721
00:30:54,410 --> 00:30:57,077
(intense music)

722
00:32:49,279 --> 00:32:51,612
(crackling)

723
00:32:57,273 --> 00:32:58,952
- [Bobby] Morning Anthony.

724
00:32:58,953 --> 00:33:01,286
(crackling)

725
00:33:15,833 --> 00:33:17,166
- [Anthony] Awe.

726
00:33:18,875 --> 00:33:23,616
Yeah, it's kinda, hello.
- Look, still missing one.

727
00:33:23,617 --> 00:33:25,034
- And Jim.
- Wade.

728
00:33:25,877 --> 00:33:28,294
- [Man] He said he was gonna.

729
00:33:29,669 --> 00:33:31,148
(mumbling inaudibly)

730
00:33:31,149 --> 00:33:33,348
- [Anthony] Chris.

731
00:33:33,349 --> 00:33:35,268
What's up?
- I don't like.

732
00:33:35,269 --> 00:33:37,748
- I'm up.
- This one's up.

733
00:33:37,749 --> 00:33:40,228
- [Steve] This is what time
I'm usually going to bed.

734
00:33:40,229 --> 00:33:41,229
(laughing)

735
00:33:41,229 --> 00:33:42,062
- [Chris] That's been burning all night?

736
00:33:42,063 --> 00:33:43,741
- [Anthony] No we
started it up and we went

737
00:33:43,742 --> 00:33:45,355
to get more logs.
- Okay.

738
00:33:47,270 --> 00:33:48,603
- [Anthony] Mmm.

739
00:33:52,002 --> 00:33:53,395
Let me get a shot of the bacon.

740
00:33:55,502 --> 00:33:58,621
So you say what 14 and two.
- I say 14 and two.

741
00:33:58,622 --> 00:33:59,761
You think they're gonna lose to Carolina.

742
00:33:59,762 --> 00:34:01,962
I don't think, they're
comin' off a by week.

743
00:34:03,741 --> 00:34:05,925
They're rested, they're,
the injuries are better, so.

744
00:34:06,981 --> 00:34:08,311
- I don't know.
- Plus you gotta be

745
00:34:08,312 --> 00:34:10,491
member of Revenge Factor, Carolina

746
00:34:10,492 --> 00:34:11,980
knocked them out last year.

747
00:34:11,981 --> 00:34:14,220
- [Jim] Watch where the fuck you're goin'.

748
00:34:14,221 --> 00:34:15,901
- Knock the fuck off, I'm just walkin' by.

749
00:34:16,501 --> 00:34:17,700
- Whatever.
- Oh, they're not gonna

750
00:34:17,701 --> 00:34:18,941
start again, are they, come on, guys.

751
00:34:18,942 --> 00:34:20,661
- Knock it off.
- We're not gonna

752
00:34:20,662 --> 00:34:22,301
start that shit again, are you?

753
00:34:22,302 --> 00:34:25,771
- Douse bag.
- Try sitting away from him.

754
00:34:25,772 --> 00:34:27,381
- [Anthony] Yeah, why are you guys like?

755
00:34:27,382 --> 00:34:28,501
- Thank you.
- Like why are you

756
00:34:28,502 --> 00:34:29,982
guys like sitting next to each other?

757
00:34:32,622 --> 00:34:34,621
- It's not testing, it's just not doing.

758
00:34:34,622 --> 00:34:35,623
- That's not far enough.

759
00:34:35,624 --> 00:34:36,631
Why don't you take your chair
and go over there somewhere?

760
00:34:36,632 --> 00:34:39,182
- [Steve] Why don't you
just shut up, Jim, come on.

761
00:34:41,745 --> 00:34:43,995
(mumbling)

762
00:34:45,065 --> 00:34:48,065
(inaudible chatter)

763
00:34:49,465 --> 00:34:51,904
We just ate breakfast and
we're talkin' about dinner.

764
00:34:51,905 --> 00:34:53,738
- So?
- I'm not hungry.

765
00:34:55,603 --> 00:34:57,270
I don't care.
- Okay.

766
00:34:58,330 --> 00:34:59,663
I'm just sayin'.

767
00:35:03,835 --> 00:35:04,835
I don't know.

768
00:35:07,092 --> 00:35:09,542
- [Steve] Chuck them over
here when you get done.

769
00:35:10,553 --> 00:35:12,552
- Go around me.
- Just fuckin' move.

770
00:35:12,553 --> 00:35:13,633
- Just go around me.
- Guys.

771
00:35:14,532 --> 00:35:17,073
Guys, yo, yo.
- Yo, what are you doin'?

772
00:35:17,074 --> 00:35:19,553
Yo, what are you doin'?
- What is your problem?

773
00:35:19,554 --> 00:35:20,953
- I asked him to move, he didn't move.

774
00:35:20,954 --> 00:35:21,902
- You don't have to pick him up.

775
00:35:21,903 --> 00:35:23,465
Geez, be such a dick.

776
00:35:24,652 --> 00:35:26,851
- Jim.
- You alright?

777
00:35:26,852 --> 00:35:28,605
- Are you alright Bobby?
- I'm alright.

778
00:35:29,532 --> 00:35:31,295
- Dude, you really need to chill out.

779
00:35:32,514 --> 00:35:33,671
- Asshole.
- Jim, what did I ask

780
00:35:33,672 --> 00:35:35,981
last night?
- Keep him away from me.

781
00:35:35,982 --> 00:35:39,441
That's what I asked.
- And he was away from you.

782
00:35:39,442 --> 00:35:42,669
- I needed to be there,
he didn't need to be.

783
00:35:45,800 --> 00:35:49,311
- [Wade] Somebody needs a fuckin' hug.

784
00:35:49,312 --> 00:35:50,691
- [Anthony] We're playin' fetch.

785
00:35:50,692 --> 00:35:55,692
- Reese, Reese, Reese.
- Reese, go to him, go.

786
00:35:56,122 --> 00:35:57,122
Boo.
- Reese.

787
00:36:02,064 --> 00:36:04,309
(laughing)

788
00:36:04,310 --> 00:36:05,393
Reese, Reese.

789
00:36:07,392 --> 00:36:10,642
- What the fuck is your problem, prick?

790
00:36:13,789 --> 00:36:15,811
- [Anthony] Excuse you.

791
00:36:15,812 --> 00:36:17,025
Jim.
- What?

792
00:36:18,912 --> 00:36:19,912
- [Man] Thank you.

793
00:36:21,942 --> 00:36:25,636
- Ouch.
- How you put on a condom.

794
00:36:25,637 --> 00:36:27,964
- Thank you Jim.
- Ease it in.

795
00:36:27,965 --> 00:36:29,384
(laughing)

796
00:36:29,385 --> 00:36:32,184
(fly buzzing)

797
00:36:32,185 --> 00:36:34,518
(crackling)

798
00:36:38,405 --> 00:36:39,572
- Don't start.

799
00:36:41,752 --> 00:36:45,515
- [Anthony] I'm just sayin'
he's a little bit concerned, so.

800
00:36:46,442 --> 00:36:48,041
Why don't you two just
stay away from each other?

801
00:36:48,042 --> 00:36:49,042
- Sounds good to me.

802
00:36:50,867 --> 00:36:55,867
(inaudible chatter)
(crickets chirping)

803
00:37:18,749 --> 00:37:21,268
(inaudibly yelling and chattering)

804
00:37:21,269 --> 00:37:23,808
(crunching)

805
00:37:23,809 --> 00:37:26,371
- [Amy] So it's gotta, here it is, but.

806
00:37:26,372 --> 00:37:28,871
- [Anthony] Oh okay, so it's
an actual one you plug in.

807
00:37:28,872 --> 00:37:29,872
Okay.

808
00:37:30,989 --> 00:37:34,288
- [Amy] I don't have anything
else besides that one.

809
00:37:34,289 --> 00:37:36,868
- [Anthony] Where'd you get this?

810
00:37:36,869 --> 00:37:38,308
- Her parents bought it for us.

811
00:37:38,309 --> 00:37:39,968
- [Anthony] Oh okay, nice.

812
00:37:39,969 --> 00:37:42,800
- Tell Jim to bring it over here.

813
00:37:42,801 --> 00:37:43,634
(inaudible chatter)

814
00:37:43,635 --> 00:37:45,295
- [Anthony] Hey Jim, what do you need?

815
00:37:47,415 --> 00:37:49,365
What do you need open?
- Can of beans.

816
00:37:50,535 --> 00:37:52,021
- Chili.
- Chili, kidney beans.

817
00:37:52,022 --> 00:37:54,522
- [Anthony] Okay 'cause
it's a plug in can opener.

818
00:37:57,162 --> 00:37:58,162
I know.

819
00:37:59,712 --> 00:38:00,771
I know.

820
00:38:00,772 --> 00:38:03,097
- You have got to be shitting me.

821
00:38:03,098 --> 00:38:04,765
- I know.
- Hey Eric.

822
00:38:06,698 --> 00:38:08,141
Eric.

823
00:38:08,142 --> 00:38:10,635
Did you bring the generator
for the can opener?

824
00:38:13,579 --> 00:38:15,021
(whirring)

825
00:38:15,022 --> 00:38:16,882
- [Anthony] Actually
looks pretty damn good.

826
00:38:18,299 --> 00:38:20,778
- [Jim] Let's hope it tastes good.

827
00:38:20,779 --> 00:38:23,178
- [Anthony] It should.

828
00:38:23,179 --> 00:38:24,651
- [Jim] What kind of bowls we have to eat?

829
00:38:24,652 --> 00:38:27,418
- [Anthony] We have styrofoam
bowls, will that work?

830
00:38:27,419 --> 00:38:28,739
- That'll work.

831
00:38:28,740 --> 00:38:30,499
You don't think they'll be too hot?

832
00:38:30,500 --> 00:38:33,459
- Na, this is done, this is very easy.

833
00:38:33,460 --> 00:38:34,651
- Okay.
- Anybody know where

834
00:38:34,652 --> 00:38:36,891

- Bobby, sit down.

835
00:38:36,892 --> 00:38:37,725
- [Bobby] I just wanna
know where the candy is.

836
00:38:37,726 --> 00:38:39,951
- [Anthony] Bobby, sit
down, I'll get it for you.

837
00:38:39,952 --> 00:38:41,174
- I just wanna know where the candy is.

838
00:38:41,175 --> 00:38:43,291
- Just get the fuck outta here.

839
00:38:43,292 --> 00:38:44,125
- What the fuck is your problem?

840
00:38:44,125 --> 00:38:44,958
- Go.

841
00:38:44,959 --> 00:38:46,531

842
00:38:46,532 --> 00:38:47,692
- Get outta here.

843
00:38:47,693 --> 00:38:48,693

844
00:38:48,693 --> 00:38:49,526
- [Anthony] Guys, come on.

845
00:38:49,527 --> 00:38:50,541
- Asshole.
- Wanna step?

846
00:38:50,542 --> 00:38:53,292
What?
- Fuckin' in my face.

847
00:38:53,293 --> 00:38:54,812
- [Anthony] Guys, yo, Jim.

848
00:38:54,813 --> 00:38:56,972
- Fuckin' asshole.
- Stop it.

849
00:38:56,973 --> 00:38:58,531
Stop it.
- Yo yo yo yo.

850
00:38:58,532 --> 00:39:00,534
What you doin', what you doin'?

851
00:39:00,535 --> 00:39:02,231
- He startin' shit.
- He wants food.

852
00:39:02,232 --> 00:39:04,874
Jesus, food for all of us,
what the hell are you doin'?

853
00:39:04,875 --> 00:39:06,295
- Get the fuck away from me.

854
00:39:09,832 --> 00:39:11,911
- [Anthony] Bobby, bobby,
bobby, bobby, come on.

855
00:39:11,912 --> 00:39:12,912
Bobby.
- Come on.

856
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,331
- [Wade] What's your problem seriously?

857
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:16,341
- He's my fuckin' problem.

858
00:39:16,342 --> 00:39:17,661
- No, there is, you're the only one

859
00:39:17,662 --> 00:39:19,131
with the one that's
like callin' shit, man.

860
00:39:19,132 --> 00:39:20,656
What's your fuckin' problem?

861
00:39:20,657 --> 00:39:21,490
- I'm over here fuckin' cookin' dinner.

862
00:39:21,491 --> 00:39:24,538
- [Wade] So and he comes
over to get somethin' to eat.

863
00:39:24,539 --> 00:39:25,539
- I'm not botherin' him.

864
00:39:25,539 --> 00:39:26,539
- He just comes over to
see how you're doin', man.

865
00:39:26,539 --> 00:39:27,372
You need to chill out with
this fuckin' bullshit, alright.

866
00:39:27,372 --> 00:39:28,372
Seriously.

867
00:39:30,222 --> 00:39:31,891
- [Anthony] This is not gonna
be a repeat of last night.

868
00:39:31,892 --> 00:39:32,892
Alright Jim.

869
00:39:34,021 --> 00:39:35,012
- Keep him away from me, I told you that.

870
00:39:35,013 --> 00:39:37,621
- Dude, he just wants.
- You're around all the food.

871
00:39:37,622 --> 00:39:39,471
He wanted to get somethin'.

872
00:39:39,472 --> 00:39:40,871
- Wait till I'm gone then.

873
00:39:40,872 --> 00:39:42,911
- Then leave, fuck it, shit.

874
00:39:42,912 --> 00:39:44,621
- I'd like to.
- You're not the only

875
00:39:44,622 --> 00:39:45,902
one that can fuckin' cook, shit.

876
00:39:47,142 --> 00:39:49,401
Stop bein' a fuckin'
shit all the time, man.

877
00:39:49,402 --> 00:39:53,261
- [Anthony] All I am saying,
I mean, I've asked you

878
00:39:53,262 --> 00:39:55,311
several times to stay
away from him, alright.

879
00:39:55,312 --> 00:39:56,758
I didn't know there would
be this much tension between

880
00:39:56,759 --> 00:39:58,521
you two but seriously.
- Yeah, I didn't either.

881
00:39:58,522 --> 00:40:00,511
I'm not gonna compromise my trip just

882
00:40:00,512 --> 00:40:02,661
because he's gonna be a prick about it.

883
00:40:02,662 --> 00:40:05,241
I don't even know what
the hell his problem is.

884
00:40:05,242 --> 00:40:06,981
- [Steve] You just need to
stay away from him though.

885
00:40:06,982 --> 00:40:09,510
Come on.
- Bobby.

886
00:40:09,511 --> 00:40:12,711
Bobby, it looks like
you're antagonizing him.

887
00:40:12,712 --> 00:40:14,161
That's what it looks like right now.

888
00:40:14,162 --> 00:40:16,731
- Well I'm not, I went
over there to go get food.

889
00:40:16,732 --> 00:40:20,141
And that's it, I'm
really hungry right now.

890
00:40:20,142 --> 00:40:22,031
- [Steve] Well, we're all hungry.

891
00:40:22,032 --> 00:40:24,431
- I just wanted to go get some candy.

892
00:40:24,432 --> 00:40:26,028
- [Anthony] Well it looks
like you're antagonizing him.

893
00:40:26,029 --> 00:40:31,029
And he thinks that and.
- You guys gotta chill out.

894
00:40:31,472 --> 00:40:33,358
This is ridiculous.
- This really is.

895
00:40:33,359 --> 00:40:35,779
I mean, this is the last
time I'm doing this.

896
00:40:35,780 --> 00:40:37,099
- You're supposed to
be out here having fun.

897
00:40:37,100 --> 00:40:38,639
- [Anthony] This seriously
is the last time.

898
00:40:38,640 --> 00:40:40,239
- What we're not having is fun.

899
00:40:40,240 --> 00:40:42,001
- [Jim] Anthony, grab the silverware too.

900
00:40:42,002 --> 00:40:44,061
Spoons and whatnot.
- Chris is getting it.

901
00:40:44,062 --> 00:40:45,145
- [Jim] Okay.

902
00:40:47,362 --> 00:40:48,711
- [Anthony] Well anyway, I'm just,

903
00:40:48,712 --> 00:40:51,141
all I'm saying is please
just stay away from him.

904
00:40:51,142 --> 00:40:52,855
You need something, ask one of us.

905
00:40:55,542 --> 00:40:58,662
- [Wade] I think that's
bullshit, he asks shit for shit.

906
00:41:01,102 --> 00:41:02,352
- [Anthony] Wade, I know.

907
00:41:04,162 --> 00:41:05,152
Why, what's a bug on me?

908
00:41:05,152 --> 00:41:06,152
- Mosquito.
- Oh.

909
00:41:10,266 --> 00:41:12,421
You're not scoring any points here.

910
00:41:12,422 --> 00:41:13,971
- Yeah, you've made
that clear this weekend.

911
00:41:13,972 --> 00:41:14,805
- [Anthony] Yeah I know.

912
00:41:14,806 --> 00:41:17,131
Do I have to make it even clearer?

913
00:41:17,132 --> 00:41:19,201
- I told you to keep him away.

914
00:41:19,202 --> 00:41:21,481
- [Anthony] He's not, we're
all in this tight space here.

915
00:41:21,482 --> 00:41:23,825
- I'm done talkin' about this.

916
00:41:27,842 --> 00:41:29,905
- [Anthony] What about, what happened to?

917
00:41:29,906 --> 00:41:30,739
- Where's the bowls, can
we get some bowls yet?

918
00:41:30,740 --> 00:41:32,221
- [Anthony] I don't know.

919
00:41:32,222 --> 00:41:34,005
They're right in your trunk.

920
00:41:34,006 --> 00:41:36,027
- He has my keys.
- Chris.

921
00:41:36,028 --> 00:41:36,861
- [Chris] I can't find the bowls.

922
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:37,694
(laughing)

923
00:41:37,695 --> 00:41:39,135
- [Anthony] Alright, Jim, your turn.

924
00:41:39,649 --> 00:41:41,899
(laughing)

925
00:41:43,232 --> 00:41:44,611
- [Wade] He landed that one.

926
00:41:44,612 --> 00:41:46,491
- That was pretty funny.
- Delayed reaction.

927
00:41:46,492 --> 00:41:48,742
(laughing)

928
00:41:51,109 --> 00:41:53,973
How do you fit four
faggots on a bar stool?

929
00:41:53,974 --> 00:41:55,051
- Dude.
- Jim.

930
00:41:55,052 --> 00:41:56,533
- [Steve] What's with the fag jokes?

931
00:41:56,534 --> 00:41:58,053
- Turn it upside down.
- What the fuck

932
00:41:58,054 --> 00:41:58,887
is your problem, asshole?

933
00:41:58,888 --> 00:42:00,773
- You're my fuckin' problem, dickhead?

934
00:42:00,774 --> 00:42:02,416
- [Bobby] I haven't even
fuckin' done anything to you.

935
00:42:02,417 --> 00:42:04,218
- [Anthony] Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa.

936
00:42:04,219 --> 00:42:06,458
- Chill the fuck out.
- I didn't do anything to you.

937
00:42:06,459 --> 00:42:07,292
- Sit down.
- Sit down, come on.

938
00:42:07,292 --> 00:42:08,125
Sit down.
- Guys.

939
00:42:08,126 --> 00:42:09,332
- Bobby.
- Get out of my face.

940
00:42:09,333 --> 00:42:10,612
- Get the fuck off.
- Get the fuck

941
00:42:10,613 --> 00:42:12,041

- Guys chill, chill.

942
00:42:12,042 --> 00:42:13,991
- Asshole.
- Fuck you.

943
00:42:13,992 --> 00:42:15,661
- Fuck you.
- You shit.

944
00:42:15,662 --> 00:42:16,652
- Yo dude.
- Fucker.

945
00:42:16,653 --> 00:42:18,652
- Shut the fuck up.
- Wade.

946
00:42:18,653 --> 00:42:19,931
- Chill, chill, chill, alright.

947
00:42:19,932 --> 00:42:21,573
Come on guys.
- Yo, yo, yo, wait.

948
00:42:21,574 --> 00:42:23,221
- Come on.
- Somebody's gonna trip.

949
00:42:23,222 --> 00:42:25,415
- Fuckin' asshole.
- Seriously.

950
00:42:25,416 --> 00:42:26,655
- Fuckin' bitch.
- Stop it.

951
00:42:26,656 --> 00:42:27,489
- Come on Bobby.
- Stop it.

952
00:42:27,490 --> 00:42:29,495
Both of you.
- Seriously,

953
00:42:29,496 --> 00:42:30,695
chill the fuck out.
- What's up with you guys?

954
00:42:30,696 --> 00:42:31,781
- Knock it off.
- Just sit the fuck down.

955
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:33,405
Sit down.
- Bobby.

956
00:42:34,736 --> 00:42:35,572
- Leave me alone, I'll be fine.

957
00:42:35,573 --> 00:42:37,695
- Where are you going?
- Going for a walk.

958
00:42:38,777 --> 00:42:39,976
- [Anthony] Are you gonna be okay?

959
00:42:39,977 --> 00:42:42,696
- Yeah.
- Do you want a flashlight?

960
00:42:42,697 --> 00:42:45,401
- [Bobby] No, I'll be fine.

961
00:42:45,402 --> 00:42:46,402
- [Anthony] Jim.

962
00:42:50,977 --> 00:42:52,611
I'd like to personally thank
you for ruining my weekend

963
00:42:52,612 --> 00:42:54,101
and ruining everyone's weekend.

964
00:42:54,102 --> 00:42:55,641
- Congratulations.
- Asshole.

965
00:42:55,642 --> 00:42:57,871
- Hey, I told ya, I didn't have to come.

966
00:42:57,872 --> 00:42:58,772
- [Steve] Yeah, you should've stayed home.

967
00:42:58,773 --> 00:43:00,611
- [Anthony] You're the one
who said you know what,

968
00:43:00,612 --> 00:43:02,291
Anthony, you won the film festival.

969
00:43:02,292 --> 00:43:04,431
It was a great film, got all these awards.

970
00:43:04,432 --> 00:43:06,451
You got a scholarship,
let's take ya camping

971
00:43:06,452 --> 00:43:07,652
since you've never been.

972
00:43:09,942 --> 00:43:10,775
- You didn't tell me he was comin'

973
00:43:10,776 --> 00:43:12,214
or I'd have stayed.
- I told you I was

974
00:43:12,215 --> 00:43:14,391
allowed to invite, wait, no, you told me

975
00:43:14,392 --> 00:43:15,981
I was allowed to invite anybody I wanted.

976
00:43:15,982 --> 00:43:16,922
- It's his thing.
- I didn't know

977
00:43:16,923 --> 00:43:18,572
it was gonna be him.
- For once.

978
00:43:19,980 --> 00:43:21,420
- You guys want me to
fuckin' leave, I'll leave.

979
00:43:21,421 --> 00:43:22,900
- See you later.
- You know what,

980
00:43:22,901 --> 00:43:24,740
you've been in a fuckin'
pissy mood all weekend.

981
00:43:24,741 --> 00:43:26,881
Go ahead, who the fuck cares?

982
00:43:26,882 --> 00:43:28,161
- You want me to leave?

983
00:43:28,162 --> 00:43:29,281
- [Anthony] I don't want you to leave.

984
00:43:29,282 --> 00:43:30,681
I want you to get along with Bobby.

985
00:43:30,682 --> 00:43:33,251
He didn't do a fuckin' thing to you.

986
00:43:33,252 --> 00:43:34,649
You're ruining my weekend.

987
00:43:34,650 --> 00:43:36,900
(laughing)

988
00:43:37,752 --> 00:43:40,029
- And they talk about how like?

989
00:43:40,030 --> 00:43:42,749
- [Anthony] Think he's gonna be okay?

990
00:43:42,750 --> 00:43:43,750
- [Wade] He's the player
of the year because.

991
00:43:43,751 --> 00:43:44,769
- I don't like him out
there walking in the dark.

992
00:43:44,770 --> 00:43:47,409
- [Anthony] I know, there
are hunters out there.

993
00:43:47,410 --> 00:43:49,351
- [Wade] Wife pregnant and
convinced him to go after it.

994
00:43:49,352 --> 00:43:50,352
- You think we should go after him?

995
00:43:50,352 --> 00:43:51,352
- [Wade] What are you doin' over there?

996
00:43:51,353 --> 00:43:53,781
- You give him a flashlight?
- No, he didn't want one.

997
00:43:53,782 --> 00:43:55,891
- He shouldn't be out
there walkin' by himself.

998
00:43:55,892 --> 00:43:58,101
- [Anthony] I know, I know.
(laughing)

999
00:43:58,102 --> 00:44:00,281
I swear he's my friend
and everything, but.

1000
00:44:00,282 --> 00:44:01,129
- Dude, you need to find new friends.

1001
00:44:01,130 --> 00:44:02,961
This guy's a fuckin' psycho.

1002
00:44:02,962 --> 00:44:04,161
- [Anthony] Well you guys are my friends.

1003
00:44:04,162 --> 00:44:05,891
- Yeah but we've been cool all weekend.

1004
00:44:05,892 --> 00:44:09,023
He's the one that's been
the fuckin' pain in the ass.

1005
00:44:09,024 --> 00:44:11,064
- I don't give a mother
fucker, I'll still stab him.

1006
00:44:11,944 --> 00:44:12,944
I swear I'll stab him, I don't care.

1007
00:44:12,944 --> 00:44:13,777
- In the face.
- In the face.

1008
00:44:13,778 --> 00:44:15,343
- [Anthony] You buzzed yet, Wade?

1009
00:44:15,344 --> 00:44:16,983
- No actually I'm not buzzed at all.

1010
00:44:16,984 --> 00:44:17,984
- [Steve] Yeah, I know.

1011
00:44:17,984 --> 00:44:18,984
I was listenin' to the game.

1012
00:44:18,985 --> 00:44:20,103
- [Anthony] I hope the Yankees lose.

1013
00:44:20,104 --> 00:44:22,144
- [Steve] They fuckin' tied the game up.

1014
00:44:22,145 --> 00:44:23,344
- [Wade] You keep sayin' that.

1015
00:44:23,345 --> 00:44:26,148
You know your truck's still on.

1016
00:44:26,149 --> 00:44:27,149
- [Anthony] They were down
five to one and they tied it?

1017
00:44:27,149 --> 00:44:28,149
- The tied it.
- Ah.

1018
00:44:28,150 --> 00:44:29,348
What's the series?

1019
00:44:29,349 --> 00:44:31,028
- I think it's tied one one.
- One one.

1020
00:44:31,029 --> 00:44:32,029
- It's right there.
- Chris,

1021
00:44:32,030 --> 00:44:33,301
you are not allowed to
steal my dog, I'm sorry.

1022
00:44:33,302 --> 00:44:34,511
- I've never had.
- I don't know what

1023
00:44:34,512 --> 00:44:36,748
dog you're talkin' about,
there's no dogs here.

1024
00:44:36,749 --> 00:44:39,228
(laughing)

1025
00:44:39,229 --> 00:44:40,471
- [Wade] You sick fuck.

1026
00:44:40,472 --> 00:44:41,991
(laughing)

1027
00:44:41,992 --> 00:44:44,551
- There's no dog here.
- You sick fuck.

1028
00:44:44,552 --> 00:44:45,751
(laughing)

1029
00:44:45,752 --> 00:44:48,511
- I'm outta here.
- See if you can catch up.

1030
00:44:48,512 --> 00:44:50,762
(laughing)

1031
00:44:52,780 --> 00:44:54,341
- [Anthony] So where the fuck were you?

1032
00:44:54,342 --> 00:44:55,342
- I took a walk.

1033
00:44:57,144 --> 00:44:59,571
- [Anthony] Okay where did you go?

1034
00:44:59,572 --> 00:45:03,835
- I took a walk.
- Where'd you walk to bitch?

1035
00:45:05,592 --> 00:45:08,227
Yeah.
- Just leave him alone.

1036
00:45:08,228 --> 00:45:10,308
- [Wade] Fuck that, he's been
messin' with people all week.

1037
00:45:10,309 --> 00:45:11,749
Why can't I mess with him, fuck him.

1038
00:45:13,029 --> 00:45:14,201
- [Anthony] Wade, you're
such the instigator.

1039
00:45:14,202 --> 00:45:15,465
- And?
- Alright.

1040
00:45:16,789 --> 00:45:18,291
- Shit, somebody needs to fuckin'
fuck with him for a while.

1041
00:45:18,292 --> 00:45:21,195
See how he likes it,
yeah, I'm talkin' to you.

1042
00:45:23,149 --> 00:45:25,468
- [Steve] Get the hell off me, whoa.

1043
00:45:25,469 --> 00:45:28,778
(crickets chirping)

1044
00:45:28,779 --> 00:45:31,349
- [Anthony] Hey Wade, what time is it?

1045
00:45:31,350 --> 00:45:32,350
- About 10, 10:30.

1046
00:45:33,350 --> 00:45:34,183
(sighs)

1047
00:45:34,184 --> 00:45:35,201
- You know what, he's been gone a while.

1048
00:45:35,202 --> 00:45:37,509
- Yeah he has.
- I'm gettin' worried.

1049
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:38,841
You know what, I think we
should go look for him.

1050
00:45:38,842 --> 00:45:39,842
- [Anthony] Yeah.

1051
00:45:40,682 --> 00:45:41,691
Chris.
- Yeah?

1052
00:45:41,692 --> 00:45:43,189
- [Anthony] Will you come with me?

1053
00:45:43,190 --> 00:45:44,469
Get a flashlight, we're
gonna go look for Bobby.

1054
00:45:44,470 --> 00:45:46,270
(inaudible chattering)

1055
00:45:46,271 --> 00:45:47,104
- Where's the knife at?
- Knife is attached to

1056
00:45:47,105 --> 00:45:49,015
the stick.
- Bobby.

1057
00:45:50,312 --> 00:45:51,312
Bobby.

1058
00:45:52,122 --> 00:45:57,122
Bobby, Bobby, Bobby, oh my
god, oh fuck, oh shit, guys.

1059
00:46:00,752 --> 00:46:02,665
- Wade, yo.
- Guys.

1060
00:46:03,672 --> 00:46:06,561
- Wade, Bobby's over there.
- Bobby's over there.

1061
00:46:06,562 --> 00:46:08,441
I think he's dead.
- What?

1062
00:46:08,442 --> 00:46:09,941
- [Anthony] Bobby's dead.

1063
00:46:09,942 --> 00:46:11,645
Come on, Bobby's dead, I think.

1064
00:46:13,312 --> 00:46:16,191
(gasping)

1065
00:46:16,192 --> 00:46:18,821
Oh my god, oh my god.
- What happened?

1066
00:46:18,822 --> 00:46:20,172
- [Anthony] I have no idea.

1067
00:46:22,112 --> 00:46:26,141
Check his pulse.
- Bobby.

1068
00:46:26,142 --> 00:46:27,142
- [Anthony] Bobby.

1069
00:46:28,392 --> 00:46:33,392
- Shit, fuck, he's dead.

1070
00:46:34,832 --> 00:46:37,835
- Oh my god.
- Where the fuck is Jim?

1071
00:46:37,836 --> 00:46:39,391
Where the fuck is Jim, fuck this shit.

1072
00:46:39,392 --> 00:46:41,335
- [Anthony] Fuckin' asshole, Jim!

1073
00:46:46,932 --> 00:46:48,432
Jim, what the fuck did you do?

1074
00:46:49,362 --> 00:46:51,635
Jim, what the fuck did you do?

1075
00:46:51,636 --> 00:46:53,155
Bobby.
- What are you talkin' about?

1076
00:46:53,156 --> 00:46:54,515
- What did you do?
- What's goin' on?

1077
00:46:54,516 --> 00:46:55,636
- [Steve] What the fuck did you do to him?

1078
00:46:55,637 --> 00:46:56,771
- What's goin' on?
- What the fuck, man.

1079
00:46:56,772 --> 00:46:58,651
Bobby's over there fuckin' dead.

1080
00:46:58,652 --> 00:46:59,485
- What?
- What did you do to him?

1081
00:46:59,486 --> 00:47:03,116
- [Anthony] Come here, come
on, come on, get over here.

1082
00:47:03,117 --> 00:47:04,916
- What are you talkin' about?

1083
00:47:04,917 --> 00:47:08,196
(gravel crunching)

1084
00:47:08,197 --> 00:47:10,636
- Shit.
- Jesus Christ.

1085
00:47:10,637 --> 00:47:11,470
What happened?
- I don't know.

1086
00:47:11,471 --> 00:47:12,681
- Is he dead?
- Yes, he's dead.

1087
00:47:12,682 --> 00:47:13,682
Look at him.

1088
00:47:16,322 --> 00:47:17,322
- Fuck.

1089
00:47:18,062 --> 00:47:20,971
- What the fuck did you do?
- I didn't do anything.

1090
00:47:20,972 --> 00:47:24,461
I swear I didn't do anything.
- I don't believe him.

1091
00:47:24,462 --> 00:47:26,071
- You guys are never gonna believe me.

1092
00:47:26,072 --> 00:47:27,421
- Fuck that.
- You fuckin' did that.

1093
00:47:27,422 --> 00:47:29,178
- [Anthony] Guys, knock
it off, knock it off.

1094
00:47:29,179 --> 00:47:31,478
- [Steve] All fuckin'
weekend you were on him.

1095
00:47:31,479 --> 00:47:32,312
- I didn't do anything.

1096
00:47:32,313 --> 00:47:33,545
Guys, I didn't do it.

1097
00:47:34,462 --> 00:47:36,455
- [Anthony] What the fuck are we gonna do?

1098
00:47:37,542 --> 00:47:39,111
- Dude.
- Do we have any

1099
00:47:39,112 --> 00:47:42,160
cell phones out here?
- Mine doesn't have signal.

1100
00:47:42,161 --> 00:47:43,811
- None that work.
- I can't get signal

1101
00:47:43,812 --> 00:47:45,712
out here at all.
- Let me check mine.

1102
00:47:46,685 --> 00:47:48,185
- [Anthony] Jesus.

1103
00:47:50,606 --> 00:47:51,841
- [Wade] Ah man, I don't
know what to fuckin' do.

1104
00:47:51,842 --> 00:47:53,681
- [Steve] We gotta call the
cops, we gotta do somethin'.

1105
00:47:53,682 --> 00:47:55,565
- We can't leave him here.
- What are we gonna do?

1106
00:47:55,566 --> 00:47:56,399
- We can't just leave him here,

1107
00:47:56,400 --> 00:47:57,925
that's our friend layin' there.

1108
00:47:57,926 --> 00:47:59,045
- What the hell else are we gonna do?

1109
00:47:59,046 --> 00:47:59,879
- [Eric] There's no way we can hike

1110
00:47:59,880 --> 00:48:01,755
15, 20 miles in the dark.
- We can't try.

1111
00:48:03,728 --> 00:48:04,728
- But we can't just leave him here.

1112
00:48:04,729 --> 00:48:05,562
- What are we gonna do with him?

1113
00:48:05,562 --> 00:48:06,492
He's out there fuckin' wanderin' around.

1114
00:48:06,493 --> 00:48:08,201
Let's get a tarp, we'll cover him up.

1115
00:48:08,202 --> 00:48:09,841
We can't touch it 'cause
you know the police

1116
00:48:09,842 --> 00:48:11,471
are gonna investigate.
- Yeah but even putting

1117
00:48:11,472 --> 00:48:13,728
a tarp on it, isn't that
gonna like destroy evidence

1118
00:48:13,729 --> 00:48:15,004
or something?
- No, that'll cover.

1119
00:48:15,005 --> 00:48:17,071
That'll cover the crime scene.

1120
00:48:17,072 --> 00:48:18,238
- Fuck that, I say we fuckin' find Jim

1121
00:48:18,239 --> 00:48:21,221
and fuckin' smoke his ass.
- Wade, Wade, Wade.

1122
00:48:21,222 --> 00:48:23,499
- Yo man, look.
- We already got

1123
00:48:24,431 --> 00:48:25,961
one dead guy out here, we don't
need another one, alright.

1124
00:48:25,962 --> 00:48:27,981
- [Wade] Fuck that shit, he's
a fuckin' asshole anyway.

1125
00:48:27,982 --> 00:48:29,311
- Yeah, I know.
- Who's gonna fuckin' miss

1126
00:48:29,312 --> 00:48:30,212
him?
- Two wrongs don't make a

1127
00:48:30,213 --> 00:48:32,012
right.
- He might not have done it.

1128
00:48:33,151 --> 00:48:33,984
- [Wade] What do you mean,
he might not have done it.

1129
00:48:33,985 --> 00:48:35,910
He's the only one that was
missing at the same time.

1130
00:48:35,911 --> 00:48:38,711
He said oh, I'm gonna go
to bed or I'm gonna go

1131
00:48:38,712 --> 00:48:40,551
for a walk, fuck that shit.

1132
00:48:40,552 --> 00:48:42,301
- They both just happened to disappear

1133
00:48:42,302 --> 00:48:43,871
and now Bobby's dead.
- I don't know.

1134
00:48:43,872 --> 00:48:44,941
We might not be the only people here.

1135
00:48:44,942 --> 00:48:46,811
- He was the only one
fuckin' instigatin' Bobby.

1136
00:48:46,812 --> 00:48:47,645
Fuck that shit.
- What the fuck

1137
00:48:47,646 --> 00:48:49,105
and I gonna tell his mother?

1138
00:48:50,232 --> 00:48:52,965
- [Eric] Look, we need to let
the police investigate this.

1139
00:48:52,966 --> 00:48:54,799
- Jesus.
- But we wait.

1140
00:48:56,327 --> 00:48:58,006
- Fuck, I say leave him out there.

1141
00:48:58,007 --> 00:48:59,007
- Where the fuck did he go, anyway?

1142
00:48:59,008 --> 00:49:00,886
- [Anthony] I have no
idea, I have no idea.

1143
00:49:00,887 --> 00:49:01,887
Let's.
- Yeah.

1144
00:49:01,888 --> 00:49:03,631
I say fuckin' find him and
lynch his ass, fuck that.

1145
00:49:03,632 --> 00:49:04,811
- [Anthony] Well Wade.

1146
00:49:04,812 --> 00:49:07,221
- [Chris] Wade just go back to the site.

1147
00:49:07,222 --> 00:49:08,851
- Man, I don't get shit man.

1148
00:49:08,852 --> 00:49:10,431
How are we gonna get a code of anybody.

1149
00:49:10,432 --> 00:49:12,061
This is fucked up.
- I don't have a signal.

1150
00:49:12,062 --> 00:49:14,031
I've got nothin'.
- My battery's dead.

1151
00:49:14,032 --> 00:49:16,455
But even then I haven't
had a signal all weekend.

1152
00:49:19,017 --> 00:49:20,558
- Man, fuck that shit
man, I'm not gonna have

1153
00:49:20,559 --> 00:49:22,751
him fuckin' runnin' around all night.

1154
00:49:22,752 --> 00:49:24,641
Let's find that mother
fucker, fuck this shit.

1155
00:49:24,642 --> 00:49:25,811
- [Anthony] Well we're finding him.

1156
00:49:25,812 --> 00:49:28,561
But we're not gonna beat him up.

1157
00:49:28,562 --> 00:49:30,921
- We're not what, fuck that,
he fuckin' killed somebody,

1158
00:49:30,922 --> 00:49:31,852
man, fuck that.
- We don't know

1159
00:49:31,853 --> 00:49:33,571
that he killed him.
- He could've.

1160
00:49:33,572 --> 00:49:35,108
- [Wade] He's the only
one that was missin'.

1161
00:49:35,109 --> 00:49:36,638
- We don't know if he did.
- He was the only one that

1162
00:49:36,639 --> 00:49:40,331
was missing, man, that's
fucked up man, fuck this shit.

1163
00:49:40,332 --> 00:49:42,070
Let's go get that mother fucker.

1164
00:49:42,071 --> 00:49:42,904
- Wade, Wade.
- What, what?

1165
00:49:42,905 --> 00:49:46,362
What are you gonna say to me,

1166
00:49:47,824 --> 00:49:50,641
We're gonna go fuckin' find him.

1167
00:49:50,642 --> 00:49:52,291
- [Anthony] Wade, come on.

1168
00:49:52,292 --> 00:49:53,272
- [Wade] Dude, he's your fuckin' friend.

1169
00:49:53,273 --> 00:49:54,740
He killed someone.
- I know he's my

1170
00:49:54,741 --> 00:49:56,421
fuckin' friend.
- Fuck that shit.

1171
00:49:56,422 --> 00:49:58,361
I don't need the fucker.
- Jim was my fuckin'

1172
00:49:58,362 --> 00:50:00,772
friend too.
- Wait, what's that?

1173
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:03,611
- [Anthony] Jim, I think that's him.

1174
00:50:03,612 --> 00:50:04,612
- [Steve] Jim.

1175
00:50:07,112 --> 00:50:08,112
- [Anthony] Jim.

1176
00:50:11,342 --> 00:50:12,342
Jim.

1177
00:50:12,343 --> 00:50:16,361
(inaudible chattering)

1178
00:50:16,362 --> 00:50:17,362
Jim.

1179
00:50:19,902 --> 00:50:21,275
Jim, you alright?

1180
00:50:25,372 --> 00:50:26,372
Jim.

1181
00:50:29,612 --> 00:50:31,351
Wade, knock it off.
- Fuck that shit.

1182
00:50:31,352 --> 00:50:32,541
- Knock it off.
- What the fuck's

1183
00:50:32,542 --> 00:50:34,851
your problem, kid?
- Jim, what happened?

1184
00:50:34,852 --> 00:50:37,002
- [Wade] What the fuck's
your problem, man?

1185
00:50:39,032 --> 00:50:40,623
Dude, fuckin' talk to me.
- Wade, Wade, step back.

1186
00:50:40,624 --> 00:50:42,503
- I don't care.
- Steve, take care of him.

1187
00:50:42,504 --> 00:50:45,823
- [Steve] Come on, you
need to calm down, alright.

1188
00:50:45,824 --> 00:50:47,704
- You alright?
- Fuck you up, asshole.

1189
00:50:47,705 --> 00:50:49,864
(inaudible chattering)

1190
00:50:49,865 --> 00:50:51,671
- [Anthony] Jim, Jim, are you okay?

1191
00:50:51,672 --> 00:50:53,122
- I didn't do it.
- Asshole.

1192
00:50:54,585 --> 00:50:56,221
(sighs)

1193
00:50:56,222 --> 00:50:57,591
- [Anthony] Steve, take him back.

1194
00:50:57,592 --> 00:50:58,522
- [Wade] Man, fuck that, man.

1195
00:50:58,523 --> 00:51:00,445
- [Anthony] Wade, go, bye.

1196
00:51:04,666 --> 00:51:06,991
(sighs)

1197
00:51:06,992 --> 00:51:08,515
- [Jim] I don't care what they think.

1198
00:51:09,826 --> 00:51:11,826
I didn't do it, you know I didn't do it.

1199
00:51:13,682 --> 00:51:15,271
You've known me way too long that I would

1200
00:51:15,272 --> 00:51:16,622
not do somethin' like that.

1201
00:51:18,302 --> 00:51:20,565
- [Anthony] Jim, I don't even.

1202
00:51:23,012 --> 00:51:24,651
- [Jim] I know you don't
know what to think right now.

1203
00:51:24,652 --> 00:51:27,391
- [Anthony] I don't know
what to think, honestly.

1204
00:51:27,392 --> 00:51:29,735
- [Jim] And if I was in your
shoes, I wouldn't either.

1205
00:51:32,222 --> 00:51:33,546
- I mean.
- I don't like the kid.

1206
00:51:33,547 --> 00:51:37,565
I despise him but I never wish him dead.

1207
00:51:40,842 --> 00:51:42,361
I know what it looks like.

1208
00:51:42,362 --> 00:51:44,565
- [Anthony] What are we
gonna tell the police?

1209
00:51:45,882 --> 00:51:48,281
- [Jim] Tell 'em what you
saw, tell 'em what you found.

1210
00:51:48,282 --> 00:51:50,825
- [Anthony] Well I've got
enough on video tape for that.

1211
00:51:52,122 --> 00:51:53,381
- [Jim] I didn't kill him,
you don't have anything

1212
00:51:53,382 --> 00:51:55,682
on video tape that says
that I do, that I did.

1213
00:51:57,309 --> 00:51:58,321
- [Anthony] That doesn't
make a difference, Jim.

1214
00:51:58,322 --> 00:52:00,428
It looks suspicious.
- I know what it looks.

1215
00:52:00,429 --> 00:52:01,628
- The whole.
- I know what the

1216
00:52:01,629 --> 00:52:03,228
fuck it looks like.
- The whole time

1217
00:52:03,229 --> 00:52:06,511
he's been here, the whole
time we've been here.

1218
00:52:06,512 --> 00:52:07,512
You've been.

1219
00:52:10,162 --> 00:52:11,611
You've been treatin' him like shit.

1220
00:52:11,612 --> 00:52:14,071
And he didn't do a damn thing to you.

1221
00:52:14,072 --> 00:52:15,225
And now he's dead.

1222
00:52:17,232 --> 00:52:19,781
I mean, what am I supposed to think?

1223
00:52:19,782 --> 00:52:21,995
What are they supposed to think?

1224
00:52:21,996 --> 00:52:24,041
- [Jim] Fuck it, y'all
can think what you want.

1225
00:52:24,042 --> 00:52:25,205
You're going to anyway.

1226
00:52:29,262 --> 00:52:31,062
- [Anthony] Well I will back you up.

1227
00:52:32,192 --> 00:52:34,501
You know where my loyalty lies.

1228
00:52:34,502 --> 00:52:35,921
- [Jim] How the fuck are
you gonna back me up?

1229
00:52:35,922 --> 00:52:37,245
You think what they think.

1230
00:52:41,252 --> 00:52:44,341
- [Anthony] You want me
to just blindly trust you?

1231
00:52:44,342 --> 00:52:46,292
- [Jim] I'm not asking you to trust me.

1232
00:52:47,192 --> 00:52:51,161
You just, you know me.
- I've known you for 10 years.

1233
00:52:51,162 --> 00:52:52,941
- [Jim] If you think I'm
capable of something like this,

1234
00:52:52,942 --> 00:52:56,081
then maybe I am but I didn't do it.

1235
00:52:56,082 --> 00:52:58,671
- [Anthony] I didn't say,
Jim, this is not you.

1236
00:52:58,672 --> 00:53:00,001
This whole weekend has not been you.

1237
00:53:00,002 --> 00:53:04,799
I've never seen you in my
life treat anybody like that,

1238
00:53:04,800 --> 00:53:06,800
especially somebody you don't even know.

1239
00:53:11,762 --> 00:53:14,462
Is it because he's gay?
- Yes, it's because he's gay.

1240
00:53:20,502 --> 00:53:22,815
- [Anthony] You've had gay friends before.

1241
00:53:25,642 --> 00:53:27,771
Whatever, I'm on your side, okay.

1242
00:53:27,772 --> 00:53:28,692
- [Jim] How are you gonna be on my side?

1243
00:53:28,693 --> 00:53:30,865
You think what they think.
- Yeah, okay.

1244
00:53:31,722 --> 00:53:32,722
I'm loyal to you.

1245
00:53:33,566 --> 00:53:35,784
- [Eric] Look, I don't know
what the fuck's goin' on.

1246
00:53:35,785 --> 00:53:37,671
We need to resolve
somethin' 'cause them guys

1247
00:53:37,672 --> 00:53:39,405
are gettin' crazy over there.

1248
00:53:39,406 --> 00:53:41,046
We need to go back and resolve somethin'.

1249
00:53:41,971 --> 00:53:42,804
- Alright.
- They wanna tear me apart.

1250
00:53:42,805 --> 00:53:44,401
- [Anthony] Wade wants to tear you apart.

1251
00:53:44,402 --> 00:53:47,611
We can control Wade,
Steve's twice Wade's size.

1252
00:53:47,612 --> 00:53:50,371
- [Eric] We can control
Wade, let's at least resolve,

1253
00:53:50,372 --> 00:53:52,661
get some sort of.
- Control.

1254
00:53:52,662 --> 00:53:53,911
- Yeah, somethin'.
- How are we gonna

1255
00:53:53,912 --> 00:53:55,271
control, they're never gonna believe me.

1256
00:53:55,272 --> 00:53:56,715
They're all convinced.

1257
00:53:58,042 --> 00:54:01,251
Well Wade anyway, I don't know
what Chris and Steve think.

1258
00:54:01,252 --> 00:54:03,656
- [Eric] I don't know
what to think either.

1259
00:54:03,657 --> 00:54:06,204
But I'm just ya know.
- There's nothing we can do

1260
00:54:06,205 --> 00:54:08,921
till morning, okay.
- We've gotta move out

1261
00:54:08,922 --> 00:54:11,845
first thing in the mornin' and yeah.

1262
00:54:12,698 --> 00:54:13,531
- [Anthony] At least an area where

1263
00:54:13,532 --> 00:54:14,911
we have cell phone signal.

1264
00:54:14,912 --> 00:54:15,745
- [Eric] Get the authorities in here

1265
00:54:15,746 --> 00:54:17,725
and let them do their investigation.

1266
00:54:18,732 --> 00:54:20,333
See what they can find.
- If you didn't do it,

1267
00:54:20,334 --> 00:54:24,073
okay.
- I didn't do it.

1268
00:54:24,074 --> 00:54:25,481
- [Anthony] Okay, alright.

1269
00:54:25,482 --> 00:54:29,591
If that's the case.
- It's not if.

1270
00:54:29,592 --> 00:54:32,441
That's the fuckin' truth.
- They're gonna know.

1271
00:54:32,442 --> 00:54:33,442
Okay?

1272
00:54:34,882 --> 00:54:38,901
You've seen CSI and the
forensics shit they do nowadays.

1273
00:54:38,902 --> 00:54:39,902
They'll know.

1274
00:54:41,402 --> 00:54:44,015
And then they'll believe
you and I'll believe you.

1275
00:54:46,142 --> 00:54:48,951
Let's just go, come on, let's go back.

1276
00:54:48,952 --> 00:54:51,552
- Come on man, let's go.
- We have to resolve this.

1277
00:54:55,052 --> 00:54:56,589
Jim.
- Come on Jim.

1278
00:54:58,950 --> 00:55:01,429
- [Anthony] Come on.

1279
00:55:01,430 --> 00:55:03,701
(sighs)

1280
00:55:03,702 --> 00:55:06,048
- [Eric] Stay out here, it's
just gonna make it worse.

1281
00:55:06,049 --> 00:55:08,211
- [Anthony] Are you
serious, we cannot even like

1282
00:55:08,212 --> 00:55:11,411
get near to an area where
there's a signal or anything?

1283
00:55:11,412 --> 00:55:14,022
- [Eric] Dude, we're at least 15, 20 miles

1284
00:55:15,142 --> 00:55:18,591
from the nearest, I think
there's a ranger station

1285
00:55:18,592 --> 00:55:21,761
up on the other side of the
mountain but I'm not sure.

1286
00:55:21,762 --> 00:55:24,525
- [Anthony] Well okay why can't we drive?

1287
00:55:26,352 --> 00:55:27,541
- [Eric] Dude, you'll
never get up that hill.

1288
00:55:27,542 --> 00:55:29,736
You'll never get on the
other side of that mountain.

1289
00:55:29,737 --> 00:55:31,581
- [Anthony] We got down here, didn't we?

1290
00:55:31,582 --> 00:55:32,871
- [Eric] They're all horseback trails.

1291
00:55:32,872 --> 00:55:34,791
We came in from the other side.

1292
00:55:34,792 --> 00:55:35,639
- Why can't we go that way?
- There's nothin' goin'

1293
00:55:35,640 --> 00:55:39,131
back that side, we go back
the way we came in, shit.

1294
00:55:39,132 --> 00:55:42,435
We're lookin' at probably, hell, probably,

1295
00:55:47,504 --> 00:55:49,701
damn near 50 miles.
- So is that why you

1296
00:55:49,702 --> 00:55:51,483
guys came in here before dark?

1297
00:55:51,484 --> 00:55:54,641
- Yeah.
- Jim, you still there?

1298
00:55:54,642 --> 00:55:55,642
Still with us?

1299
00:55:59,684 --> 00:56:04,403
Alright, let's try to,
Wade's gonna fuckin'.

1300
00:56:04,404 --> 00:56:05,237
- [Eric] We'll need somethin' to eat,

1301
00:56:05,238 --> 00:56:09,093
just sit down, relax.
- I need a fuckin' drink.

1302
00:56:09,094 --> 00:56:11,427
- That too.
- Let me get, uh.

1303
00:56:15,172 --> 00:56:17,111
Find a signal, call the police.

1304
00:56:17,112 --> 00:56:19,191
But there's absolutely nothing we can do

1305
00:56:19,192 --> 00:56:20,895
at this point in time.

1306
00:56:20,896 --> 00:56:21,955
- Yeah, there's somethin' I can do.

1307
00:56:21,956 --> 00:56:23,515
I can beat his fuckin' ass.
- Shut up.

1308
00:56:23,516 --> 00:56:24,715
- [Anthony] Wade, shut up.

1309
00:56:24,716 --> 00:56:25,955
- Wade, come on, calm down.
- What are we talkin' about?

1310
00:56:25,956 --> 00:56:27,755
He killed somebody.
- We don't know that.

1311
00:56:27,756 --> 00:56:31,375
We don't know that.
- So just calm down.

1312
00:56:31,376 --> 00:56:32,871
- He was the only one fuckin'.

1313
00:56:32,872 --> 00:56:34,741
- Yeah you already said that.
- Were you there?

1314
00:56:34,742 --> 00:56:36,461
- Stop it.
- Bullshit.

1315
00:56:36,462 --> 00:56:38,535
- You have no fucking proof.
- Fuck you.

1316
00:56:41,322 --> 00:56:42,651
- [Anthony] Wade, if
you really believe that

1317
00:56:42,652 --> 00:56:45,341
he had anything to do with it,

1318
00:56:45,342 --> 00:56:47,057
why are you letting him sit over here?

1319
00:56:47,058 --> 00:56:49,131
- I know I've been an
asshole to him all weekend.

1320
00:56:49,132 --> 00:56:51,571
- [Wade] Because if I
fuckin' kill him right now,

1321
00:56:51,572 --> 00:56:52,552
I'm no better than what he is.

1322
00:56:52,553 --> 00:56:54,465
- But I did not kill him.
- Fuck you.

1323
00:56:56,082 --> 00:56:59,451
- Think what you want.
- I think what I know.

1324
00:56:59,452 --> 00:57:01,301
- You don't know shit.

1325
00:57:01,302 --> 00:57:02,541
- [Anthony] Guys, come on.

1326
00:57:02,542 --> 00:57:04,571
- None of you know shit.
- How you tell me

1327
00:57:04,572 --> 00:57:06,701
to fuckin' calm down, I gotta
sleep with this mother fucker

1328
00:57:06,702 --> 00:57:09,911
in the same fuckin' area,
he fuckin' killed somebody.

1329
00:57:09,912 --> 00:57:12,801
- [Anthony] Wade, we don't
know if he killed Bobby.

1330
00:57:12,802 --> 00:57:14,901
- I know I didn't do it,
I know he didn't do it.

1331
00:57:14,902 --> 00:57:16,805
He was the only one missing.

1332
00:57:20,702 --> 00:57:22,661
- [Anthony] Bobby was
gone for a long time.

1333
00:57:22,662 --> 00:57:24,211
Anything could've
happened, it doesn't mean.

1334
00:57:24,212 --> 00:57:26,041
- Oh I'm sorry, I was the
only callin' Bobby a fag

1335
00:57:26,042 --> 00:57:29,781
the whole time, I was
the one tormenting Bobby.

1336
00:57:29,782 --> 00:57:31,732
No I wasn't, it was that mother fucker.

1337
00:57:34,202 --> 00:57:37,102
God, man, how can you fuckin'
live with yourself, asshole?

1338
00:57:38,622 --> 00:57:40,901
- [Anthony] What else
do you want me to say?

1339
00:57:40,902 --> 00:57:42,752
- Get him outta here, fuck that shit.

1340
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:46,431
- [Anthony] I'm not
gonna get him outta here.

1341
00:57:46,432 --> 00:57:47,365
I'm not gonna tell him to leave.

1342
00:57:47,366 --> 00:57:50,065
- He's fine, he's not sleeping
with you tonight, okay.

1343
00:57:51,602 --> 00:57:53,889
- Doesn't matter, I don't
wanna fuckin' here it okay,

1344
00:57:53,890 --> 00:57:54,890
fuck that shit.

1345
00:57:56,730 --> 00:57:57,652
Don't go to sleep tonight, bitch.

1346
00:57:57,653 --> 00:57:59,184
- Tell you what, why don't we just,

1347
00:57:59,185 --> 00:58:01,415
let's just all stay up tonight.

1348
00:58:02,712 --> 00:58:04,009
- [Anthony] Well I know I'm not gonna

1349
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:05,730
be able to sleep.
- Yeah, I'm not going to

1350
00:58:05,731 --> 00:58:07,855
sleep.
- So let's just stay up.

1351
00:58:09,732 --> 00:58:11,931
- Let's talk and have nice conversation.

1352
00:58:11,932 --> 00:58:14,217
- Just calm down.
- Let's have a good

1353
00:58:14,218 --> 00:58:15,218
old fashioned (mumbles).

1354
00:58:20,939 --> 00:58:22,891
- [Anthony] I'm at a loss for words, guys.

1355
00:58:22,892 --> 00:58:26,521
I have no idea, this is
like, this is fuckin' unreal.

1356
00:58:26,522 --> 00:58:27,698
- If I was your fuckin'
friend, you tell me

1357
00:58:27,699 --> 00:58:29,131
to calm the fuck down, I don't
even know the mother fucker.

1358
00:58:29,132 --> 00:58:31,291
I'm still upset, fuck you.

1359
00:58:31,292 --> 00:58:33,065
- [Anthony] Wade, knock it off.

1360
00:58:34,952 --> 00:58:37,891
- [Wade] You just made a
fuckin' mistake, bitch.

1361
00:58:37,892 --> 00:58:40,431
Big fuckin' mistake.
- Anthony,

1362
00:58:40,432 --> 00:58:43,501
we gotta do somethin'.
- What are we gonna do?

1363
00:58:43,502 --> 00:58:44,571
- [Steve] I don't know but we.

1364
00:58:44,572 --> 00:58:45,572
- [Anthony] What?

1365
00:58:48,522 --> 00:58:49,355
What do we do?

1366
00:58:49,356 --> 00:58:52,335
- Fuckin'!
- Wade, Wade, yo, stop it!

1367
00:58:53,172 --> 00:58:54,711
Knock it off.
- Fuckin' leave.

1368
00:58:54,712 --> 00:58:56,831
- I didn't fuckin' do it.
- Leave right now.

1369
00:58:56,832 --> 00:58:58,201
- Just stay over here.
- Leave the fuck right now.

1370
00:58:58,202 --> 00:58:59,471
- [Jim] Where the fuck
do you want me to go?

1371
00:58:59,472 --> 00:59:01,662
- Leave, I don't give a fuck.

1372
00:59:01,663 --> 00:59:02,496
- Come on.
- Wade, there's nowhere

1373
00:59:02,497 --> 00:59:03,982
he can go.
- Fuckin' leave.

1374
00:59:03,983 --> 00:59:05,501
- We're in the middle of nowhere.

1375
00:59:05,502 --> 00:59:07,302
- Right now.
- There's nowhere to go.

1376
00:59:07,303 --> 00:59:08,431
- Fuck that shit.
- There's nowhere to go.

1377
00:59:08,432 --> 00:59:10,862
Nowhere to go.
- We can't let him go.

1378
00:59:10,863 --> 00:59:13,071
He's got nowhere to go,
we got nowhere to go.

1379
00:59:13,072 --> 00:59:14,072
- Fuck that man.

1380
00:59:16,064 --> 00:59:17,703
If you wanna fuckin' live, you better

1381
00:59:17,704 --> 00:59:18,537
fuckin' leave right now, fuck that shit.

1382
00:59:18,538 --> 00:59:20,063
You're not sleepin' here.
- Stay away from each other.

1383
00:59:20,064 --> 00:59:21,991
- [Wade] Fuck that shit,
he's fuckin' tormenting

1384
00:59:21,992 --> 00:59:23,385
some kid all fuckin' weekend.

1385
00:59:23,386 --> 00:59:25,101
I don't know how you're so fuckin' calm.

1386
00:59:25,102 --> 00:59:28,509
He's your fuckin' friend,
fuck that shit, man.

1387
00:59:33,179 --> 00:59:35,941
Get him outta here, fuck that shit, leave.

1388
00:59:35,942 --> 00:59:38,226
- Knock it off.
- Oh, I'm supposed

1389
00:59:38,227 --> 00:59:39,060
to knock it off.
- Yeah.

1390
00:59:39,061 --> 00:59:40,321
I asked you to fuckin' knock it off.

1391
00:59:40,322 --> 00:59:42,341
I'm gonna ask you again,
knock it the fuck off.

1392
00:59:42,342 --> 00:59:43,906
- What's he gonna do?

1393
00:59:43,907 --> 00:59:44,907
What are you gonna do?

1394
00:59:44,907 --> 00:59:45,907
- [Anthony] I'm not gonna do a damn thing.

1395
00:59:45,908 --> 00:59:47,271
- You gonna kill me too, oh
shit, I wish he would try.

1396
00:59:47,272 --> 00:59:48,272
Fuck that shit.

1397
00:59:49,402 --> 00:59:51,001
I'm the only one that's
fuckin' rational around here.

1398
00:59:51,002 --> 00:59:52,614
You guys, oh let's calm
down, let's calm down.

1399
00:59:52,615 --> 00:59:54,325
He fuckin' killed somebody.

1400
00:59:58,122 --> 01:00:00,661
- [Anthony] We also are out
like in the middle of nowhere.

1401
01:00:00,662 --> 01:00:02,671
- Okay, we leave now,
we could be somewhere

1402
01:00:02,672 --> 01:00:05,695
in at least an hour.
- Eric, Eric.

1403
01:00:07,962 --> 01:00:09,635
Explain it to him.
- Alright look.

1404
01:00:09,636 --> 01:00:10,469
We can't go back the same way we came.

1405
01:00:10,470 --> 01:00:12,751
We're at least an hour,
hour and a half goin' back

1406
01:00:12,752 --> 01:00:14,701
the other way, there's a
couple horse trails on the

1407
01:00:14,702 --> 01:00:16,391
other side of the mountain,
we can hike out in the

1408
01:00:16,392 --> 01:00:19,021
morning, we can be there in probably.

1409
01:00:19,022 --> 01:00:21,281
- We have cars, why can't
we go the way we came?

1410
01:00:21,282 --> 01:00:22,115
- [Anthony] We can go in the morning.

1411
01:00:22,116 --> 01:00:23,151
We can't go tonight.
- Take twice as long.

1412
01:00:23,152 --> 01:00:24,701
There's a ranger station
right on the other side

1413
01:00:24,702 --> 01:00:26,352
of the mountain, it'll be closer.

1414
01:00:27,922 --> 01:00:29,750
Either way you look at
it, we're still at least

1415
01:00:29,751 --> 01:00:31,765
probably two hours out.

1416
01:00:33,202 --> 01:00:35,191
- What time is it now?
- Any kind of communication.

1417
01:00:35,192 --> 01:00:36,261
- It's after midnight.
- We're not gonna sleep

1418
01:00:36,262 --> 01:00:38,392
tonight anyway.
- No, but look.

1419
01:00:38,393 --> 01:00:40,452
Why don't you move your tent?

1420
01:00:40,453 --> 01:00:42,032
- I know I'm not.
- Why don't you move

1421
01:00:42,033 --> 01:00:44,641
your tent next to mine,
I'm gonna be up all night.

1422
01:00:44,642 --> 01:00:47,541
Just keep an eye on and I'll
keep Wade off your back.

1423
01:00:47,542 --> 01:00:49,285
- [Anthony] You can even sleep in my tent.

1424
01:00:50,653 --> 01:00:52,212
- [Eric] We'll make it through tonight.

1425
01:00:52,213 --> 01:00:53,941
And we'll move out at first light.

1426
01:00:53,942 --> 01:00:55,142
And we'll get some help.

1427
01:00:57,982 --> 01:00:59,132
- Jesus fucking Christ.

1428
01:01:04,355 --> 01:01:05,374
- Nothin' we can do, man.
- How you figure you're

1429
01:01:05,375 --> 01:01:06,394
the only one pissed off?

1430
01:01:06,395 --> 01:01:09,645
(inaudible chattering)

1431
01:01:12,752 --> 01:01:14,751
You wanna go to jail for
the rest of your life too.

1432
01:01:14,752 --> 01:01:16,434
- I didn't do shit.
- You're trying to.

1433
01:01:16,435 --> 01:01:18,531
I'm trying to keep you from going to jail.

1434
01:01:18,532 --> 01:01:19,891
- I'll beat his ass, fuck that.

1435
01:01:19,892 --> 01:01:21,521
- Look, we can't disturb the crime scene.

1436
01:01:21,522 --> 01:01:23,122
If we do, we're all in jeopardy.

1437
01:01:25,775 --> 01:01:28,015
- [Wade] I know one thing,
that mother fucker killed him.

1438
01:01:31,077 --> 01:01:31,910
What the fuck are you doin' back?

1439
01:01:31,911 --> 01:01:33,571
- Wade knock it off.
- No, you're gonna tell me.

1440
01:01:33,572 --> 01:01:35,361
- I said knock it off.
- Yo man, I didn't

1441
01:01:35,362 --> 01:01:37,541
fuckin' invite a killer
up here, fuck that shit.

1442
01:01:37,542 --> 01:01:38,991
- I didn't invite a killer either.

1443
01:01:38,992 --> 01:01:41,376
- Oh yeah but he's gonna
fuckin' kill somebody.

1444
01:01:41,377 --> 01:01:43,076
- Come on, what the fuck you want?

1445
01:01:43,077 --> 01:01:45,424
- Fuck you man.
- Guys, guys.

1446
01:01:45,425 --> 01:01:47,311
- [Steve] Come on guys,
what are you doing?

1447
01:01:47,312 --> 01:01:50,401
Come on guys, come on, what
the hell are you guys doin'?

1448
01:01:50,402 --> 01:01:52,796
- [Wade] Man, this is
bullshit man, fuck that shit.

1449
01:01:52,797 --> 01:01:54,117
- I didn't invite a killer, okay.

1450
01:01:54,782 --> 01:01:56,491
- [Wade] Tell somebody else, asshole.

1451
01:01:56,492 --> 01:01:58,659
- [Amy] Guys, calm
down, just a little bit.

1452
01:02:01,504 --> 01:02:03,421
(sobs)

1453
01:02:16,182 --> 01:02:17,945
- [Anthony] What am I gonna tell his mom?

1454
01:02:21,764 --> 01:02:24,763
- [Jim] Tell her you
don't know what happened.

1455
01:02:24,764 --> 01:02:26,363
- But Jim, I think you did it, okay.

1456
01:02:26,364 --> 01:02:28,283
I think you fuckin' did it.
- I know you think I did it.

1457
01:02:28,284 --> 01:02:30,043
I know you think I did it.

1458
01:02:30,044 --> 01:02:32,044
And if I was in your boots, I would too.

1459
01:02:33,322 --> 01:02:36,405
I'm just asking you to
trust me, I didn't do it.

1460
01:02:42,352 --> 01:02:43,895
- Hey, you alright?

1461
01:02:45,245 --> 01:02:46,924
- What time is it?

1462
01:02:46,925 --> 01:02:49,484
(mumbles)

1463
01:02:49,485 --> 01:02:51,818
We're not gettin' any sleep.

1464
01:02:57,886 --> 01:02:58,886
- Do you need anything?

1465
01:02:58,886 --> 01:02:59,886
- No.

1466
01:03:02,486 --> 01:03:03,819
I've had enough.

1467
01:03:32,652 --> 01:03:33,652
Turn that off.

1468
01:03:35,902 --> 01:03:36,902
Please.

1469
01:03:38,972 --> 01:03:41,195
Steve, shut it off please.

1470
01:03:49,142 --> 01:03:50,142
Nevermind.

1471
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:19,140
(inaudible chatter)

1472
01:04:37,223 --> 01:04:39,271
- [Wade] Where the fuck is he going?

1473
01:04:39,272 --> 01:04:40,611
- [Anthony] I have no idea.

1474
01:04:40,612 --> 01:04:42,982
- Fuck that shit.
- Wade.

1475
01:04:42,983 --> 01:04:44,823
- Just let him go.
- He needs to stop drinking.

1476
01:04:46,023 --> 01:04:46,856
- [Wade] You make me stop drinkin',

1477
01:04:46,857 --> 01:04:48,965
I swear somethin's gonna happen.

1478
01:04:52,235 --> 01:04:53,985
- [Anthony] I am fuckin' exhausted.

1479
01:04:57,030 --> 01:04:59,269
(sighs)

1480
01:04:59,270 --> 01:05:00,370
What time is it, 4:37.

1481
01:05:03,312 --> 01:05:05,981
I haven't pulled an all
nighter in like two years.

1482
01:05:05,982 --> 01:05:10,161
- All nighter, how can you
even fuckin' compare it, man?

1483
01:05:10,162 --> 01:05:11,701
Somebody fucking dead over there.

1484
01:05:11,702 --> 01:05:13,585
- His name was Bobby, alright.

1485
01:05:14,511 --> 01:05:16,081
You keep talkin' about
him like he was a nobody.

1486
01:05:16,082 --> 01:05:18,101
His name was Bobby, call him by his name.

1487
01:05:18,102 --> 01:05:19,631
- [Wade] At least I'm recognizing the fact

1488
01:05:19,632 --> 01:05:22,132
that Bobby is dead over there.

1489
01:05:22,991 --> 01:05:25,361
The rest of you are like oh,
let's calm the fuck down.

1490
01:05:25,362 --> 01:05:26,551
- [Man] 'Cause freaking out

1491
01:05:26,552 --> 01:05:28,591
about it isn't gonna do anything.

1492
01:05:28,592 --> 01:05:30,392
- [Wade] And you want me to do what?

1493
01:05:31,372 --> 01:05:34,951
- Do nothing, you're not
a cop, just let it go.

1494
01:05:34,952 --> 01:05:39,151
Just let it go, are you a
cop, no, just let it go.

1495
01:05:39,152 --> 01:05:42,351
It's not your job.
- Doin' nothin'.

1496
01:05:42,352 --> 01:05:43,902
That's why he's over there now.

1497
01:05:44,835 --> 01:05:45,668
We did nothin' all fuckin' weekend.

1498
01:05:45,669 --> 01:05:47,181
- [Man] Somebody did something
where something happened,

1499
01:05:47,182 --> 01:05:49,481
okay, doing nothing
isn't going to affect it.

1500
01:05:49,482 --> 01:05:51,261
- We weren't there, we
don't know what happened.

1501
01:05:51,262 --> 01:05:53,674
- So let it go.
- I know what fuckin'

1502
01:05:53,675 --> 01:05:55,421
happened.
- Yeah.

1503
01:05:55,422 --> 01:05:57,401
But you're the bigger person.
- I am the bigger person.

1504
01:05:57,402 --> 01:05:59,451
I'm gonna fuckin' beat his ass too.

1505
01:05:59,452 --> 01:06:01,157
- [Steve] Yeah, that really
makes you the bigger person.

1506
01:06:01,158 --> 01:06:02,997
- [Anthony] So you're
bigger than Jim because.

1507
01:06:02,998 --> 01:06:04,171
- At least I'm doin' somethin'
than sittin' there goin'

1508
01:06:04,172 --> 01:06:05,152
let's not do.
- Well apparently

1509
01:06:05,153 --> 01:06:06,465
Jim did something too.

1510
01:06:07,642 --> 01:06:08,991
He didn't like somebody
so he just offed 'em.

1511
01:06:08,992 --> 01:06:10,381
- You can't compare me to him, man.

1512
01:06:10,382 --> 01:06:12,591
- We don't know that Jim killed him.

1513
01:06:12,592 --> 01:06:15,077
- [Wade] All I know is that
we're all fuckin' eatin',

1514
01:06:15,078 --> 01:06:17,118
havin' a good time, one goes one way.

1515
01:06:17,119 --> 01:06:18,141
- This is a good time?
- We're all comin'.

1516
01:06:18,142 --> 01:06:20,280
- Yeah this is a great time.
- This is a great time.

1517
01:06:20,281 --> 01:06:22,021
- This is a perfect time.
- I can't think of anything

1518
01:06:22,022 --> 01:06:23,411
else I'd rather do on a Saturday night.

1519
01:06:23,412 --> 01:06:26,421
- Like I said, I was talkin'
about before we found him.

1520
01:06:26,422 --> 01:06:28,271
- We're all makin' assumptions here.

1521
01:06:28,272 --> 01:06:29,325
We don't know shit.

1522
01:06:31,052 --> 01:06:32,501
- All I know is that
mother fucker tormented

1523
01:06:32,502 --> 01:06:33,781
him the whole fuckin' time.
- Yeah.

1524
01:06:33,782 --> 01:06:35,041
But that still doesn't make him a killer.

1525
01:06:35,042 --> 01:06:36,551
- [Man] You're tormenting him now, okay.

1526
01:06:36,552 --> 01:06:39,051
- Doesn't make him a killer.
- Guys, all I know

1527
01:06:39,052 --> 01:06:41,445
is I'm gonna put somebody in the fire.

1528
01:06:41,446 --> 01:06:42,925
- [Steve] That's all I'm
doing is being rational.

1529
01:06:42,926 --> 01:06:44,565
- Stop defending him.
- I'm being rational.

1530
01:06:44,566 --> 01:06:47,651
Did you see him kill him, no you didn't.

1531
01:06:47,652 --> 01:06:48,681
- None of us did.
- So you can't make

1532
01:06:48,682 --> 01:06:50,281
that assumption.
- I'm just goin' by what

1533
01:06:50,282 --> 01:06:51,871
I fuckin' know.
- Well you don't know

1534
01:06:51,872 --> 01:06:53,161
anything, you weren't there.

1535
01:06:53,162 --> 01:06:55,246
- [Wade] All I know is that he fuckin'

1536
01:06:55,247 --> 01:06:56,686
tormented him all fuckin' weekend.

1537
01:06:56,687 --> 01:06:58,726
- Tormenting and killing
are two different things.

1538
01:06:58,727 --> 01:06:59,806
- [Anthony] We all saw that.

1539
01:06:59,807 --> 01:07:01,566
- Two different things.
- We all saw that, Wade.

1540
01:07:01,567 --> 01:07:02,851
- He attacked him on
three different occasions.

1541
01:07:02,852 --> 01:07:04,651
How you gonna fuckin'
sit here and yell at me

1542
01:07:04,652 --> 01:07:06,926
when he fuckin' attacked him
on three different occasions?

1543
01:07:06,927 --> 01:07:08,471
- All I am tellin' you is be rational.

1544
01:07:08,472 --> 01:07:10,465
You don't know all the facts.

1545
01:07:11,562 --> 01:07:12,442
- Man, I came out here for you.

1546
01:07:12,443 --> 01:07:13,831
I didn't come out here for this shit.

1547
01:07:13,832 --> 01:07:15,711
- [Anthony] Well I didn't
expect this shit to happen.

1548
01:07:15,712 --> 01:07:17,487
- Yeah but we told you to
send that mother fucker home.

1549
01:07:17,488 --> 01:07:20,247
- [Anthony] And I didn't
and this happened.

1550
01:07:20,248 --> 01:07:22,887
- And you didn't.
- I realized that.

1551
01:07:22,888 --> 01:07:24,481
It's not my fault, I didn't kill him.

1552
01:07:24,482 --> 01:07:27,341
- [Steve] He didn't do it,
why are you jumping on him?

1553
01:07:27,342 --> 01:07:28,361
- All I said was send that mother fucker

1554
01:07:28,362 --> 01:07:31,531
home from the get, you told
me when you picked me up,

1555
01:07:31,532 --> 01:07:34,088
shit was goin' down,
I said let it be cool.

1556
01:07:34,089 --> 01:07:36,051
- [Anthony] I told you that
there was a little argument

1557
01:07:36,052 --> 01:07:38,915
in the morning, I didn't
think it would come to this.

1558
01:07:40,052 --> 01:07:41,052
- What's this?

1559
01:07:42,582 --> 01:07:43,905
What's fuckin' this?

1560
01:07:45,442 --> 01:07:46,442
Say it.

1561
01:07:49,152 --> 01:07:50,881
Don't sit there and be quiet and just hold

1562
01:07:50,882 --> 01:07:54,065
the fucking camera, say
it, you know what this is.

1563
01:07:55,762 --> 01:07:57,311
- [Anthony] I am partially responsible.

1564
01:07:57,312 --> 01:07:59,645
You think I don't know that?

1565
01:08:01,795 --> 01:08:02,795
- I don't know how many times we told you

1566
01:08:02,796 --> 01:08:05,601
send that mother fucker home,
you told me to be fuckin'

1567
01:08:05,602 --> 01:08:07,371
cool, be fuckin' cool.
- I know.

1568
01:08:07,372 --> 01:08:08,372
I know.

1569
01:08:09,862 --> 01:08:11,961
- Kept tellin' that mother
fucker to chill the fuck out.

1570
01:08:11,962 --> 01:08:15,111
All fuckin' weekend.
- Why don't you take

1571
01:08:15,112 --> 01:08:16,931
your own advice now?
- Yeah.

1572
01:08:16,932 --> 01:08:18,001
- Chill out.
- Exactly.

1573
01:08:18,002 --> 01:08:20,081
- [Anthony] We're so sorry we
didn't listen to you, Wade.

1574
01:08:20,082 --> 01:08:21,082
- [Steve] You're doing
exactly what he was doing.

1575
01:08:21,082 --> 01:08:22,032
Why don't you just chill out now?

1576
01:08:22,033 --> 01:08:24,035
- He's not here, I'm
not tormenting anybody.

1577
01:08:24,036 --> 01:08:25,301
- [Steve] You're tormenting us now.

1578
01:08:25,302 --> 01:08:27,481
You're blaming Anthony for his death.

1579
01:08:27,482 --> 01:08:28,791
- [Anthony] Well I can take partial

1580
01:08:28,792 --> 01:08:30,995
responsibility 'cause I let.
- You're not responsible.

1581
01:08:30,996 --> 01:08:32,541
- [Anthony] I let it
happen, I let it go on.

1582
01:08:32,542 --> 01:08:33,875
- [Steve] You didn't let anything happen.

1583
01:08:33,876 --> 01:08:36,261
That was not your fault.
- All of us have agreed

1584
01:08:36,262 --> 01:08:38,398
that we should've sent
him home a long time ago.

1585
01:08:38,399 --> 01:08:41,831
- [Anthony] Poor Wade, we didn't
listen to Wade, poor Wade.

1586
01:08:41,832 --> 01:08:42,971
- Oh, it's my fault now.
- No.

1587
01:08:42,972 --> 01:08:45,671
I never said it was your
fault, I'm not casting blame.

1588
01:08:45,672 --> 01:08:47,051
- Oh yeah, poor Wade.
- Don't act so high

1589
01:08:47,052 --> 01:08:49,441
and mighty like you knew
how to handle the situation

1590
01:08:49,442 --> 01:08:51,238
from the get go.
- I told you.

1591
01:08:51,239 --> 01:08:53,358
- Yeah you told me.
- You told me to be cool.

1592
01:08:53,359 --> 01:08:54,359
So I was cool.
- I didn't listen.

1593
01:08:54,360 --> 01:08:55,439
But neither did anybody else.
- I was cool.

1594
01:08:55,440 --> 01:08:56,273
And look what happened.

1595
01:08:56,274 --> 01:08:57,902
- [Anthony] Neither did anybody else.

1596
01:08:59,480 --> 01:09:00,480
- [Wade] Everybody told
you to send him home

1597
01:09:00,480 --> 01:09:01,313
and you were like nah.
- No.

1598
01:09:01,314 --> 01:09:02,732
I think you were the only one.

1599
01:09:03,752 --> 01:09:06,461
- [Wade] Dude, check your fuckin' tape.

1600
01:09:06,462 --> 01:09:08,901
- [Anthony] I don't need
to check my fuckin' tape.

1601
01:09:08,902 --> 01:09:11,661
- Yo guys, I'm really sorry.

1602
01:09:11,662 --> 01:09:13,800
- Wade, I'm sorry too.
- I'm sorry too.

1603
01:09:13,801 --> 01:09:16,221
It's just.
- Horrible.

1604
01:09:16,222 --> 01:09:20,160
What the, Jim, Jim what are you doin'?

1605
01:09:20,161 --> 01:09:21,960
