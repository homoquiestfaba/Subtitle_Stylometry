1
00:00:01,002 --> 00:00:05,977
From New York,
the greatest city in the world,

2
00:00:06,012 --> 00:00:10,555
it's the Late Show with David Letterman.

3
00:00:11,380 --> 00:00:13,893
Tonight, from <i>House</i>, Hugh Laurie.

4
00:00:14,013 --> 00:00:16,042
From <i>Cupid</i>, Sarah Paulson.

5
00:00:16,298 --> 00:00:19,408
And musical group Bloc Party.

6
00:00:20,150 --> 00:00:25,765
Plus Paul Shaffer, and the CBS Orchestra.

7
00:00:26,421 --> 00:00:32,162
And now, fresh from
his Turks and Caicos wedding,

8
00:00:32,742 --> 00:00:39,628
David Letterman!

9
00:00:54,889 --> 00:00:55,808
Thank you very much.

10
00:00:58,108 --> 00:00:58,706
Thank you.

11
00:01:11,668 --> 00:01:12,297
Thank you.

12
00:01:20,622 --> 00:01:24,088
By the way, spring in New York City,
feels nice, doesn't it?

13
00:01:26,122 --> 00:01:28,580
Here now is the sure sign
that it's spring in New York City:

14
00:01:28,700 --> 00:01:31,822
Earlier today, Regis opened
the windows on his apartment,

15
00:01:31,857 --> 00:01:33,344
and aired out his money!

16
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,252
Beautiful day in New York City today.

17
00:01:42,533 --> 00:01:46,891
So nice, the AIG executives
were counting their bonuses in the park!

18
00:01:53,936 --> 00:01:56,584
So sunny, Yankees third baseman
Alex Rodriguez

19
00:01:56,704 --> 00:01:58,532
came out of a whorehouse squinting!

20
00:02:06,669 --> 00:02:09,276
Here's a story that just
keeps getting better and better.

21
00:02:09,616 --> 00:02:12,740
Alex Rodriguez apparently
goes to the same whorehouse

22
00:02:12,860 --> 00:02:16,382
that former New York Governor
Eliot Spitzer used to go to.

23
00:02:18,151 --> 00:02:21,388
Listen to this: Alex's cousin is
the guy who supplied the Viagra.

24
00:02:29,793 --> 00:02:33,257
Alex Rodriguez and prostitutes,
and, I don't know why,

25
00:02:33,492 --> 00:02:36,224
but Kobe Bryant's wife ended up
with a diamond ring.

26
00:02:36,776 --> 00:02:38,349
I don't understand.

27
00:02:43,775 --> 00:02:45,550
You folks like celebrity birthdays?

28
00:02:47,543 --> 00:02:48,186
Who doesn't?

29
00:02:48,306 --> 00:02:50,687
I got one for you.
Happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell.

30
00:02:53,512 --> 00:02:54,424
Rosie O'Donnell.

31
00:02:55,868 --> 00:02:59,568
Rosie O'Donnell, 47 years old,
and happy birthday to Rosie O'Donnell,

32
00:02:59,688 --> 00:03:01,800
but I'm telling you something.
I'm beginning to wonder,

33
00:03:02,057 --> 00:03:03,690
starting to worry a little at 47.

34
00:03:03,810 --> 00:03:05,468
Is she ever gonna find the right guy.

35
00:03:08,096 --> 00:03:09,552
I don't know.

36
00:03:14,837 --> 00:03:16,825
Here's some exciting news.
You know Bruce Willis?

37
00:03:16,945 --> 00:03:19,081
Our good friend, fine actor Bruce Willis?

38
00:03:21,218 --> 00:03:23,971
Over the weekend, Bruce--
by the way, is 54 years old--

39
00:03:24,091 --> 00:03:29,402
got married to a former Victoria's Secret
supermodel by the name of...

40
00:03:37,083 --> 00:03:38,667
I know her last name is Heming.

41
00:03:39,032 --> 00:03:39,944
Henning or Heming?

42
00:03:40,241 --> 00:03:41,310
Heming is her last name.

43
00:03:41,430 --> 00:03:42,358
Henning or Heming?

44
00:03:44,208 --> 00:03:45,302
Heming with an M?

45
00:03:46,217 --> 00:03:46,861
With an M.

46
00:03:56,135 --> 00:03:56,787
Thank you.

47
00:03:59,986 --> 00:04:02,823
I have no idea why you're applauding,
but it makes me feel good.

48
00:04:03,400 --> 00:04:04,999
We wanted you to feel better.

49
00:04:05,034 --> 00:04:06,215
They're applauding ineptitude.

50
00:04:06,335 --> 00:04:07,298
Apparently.

51
00:04:07,968 --> 00:04:10,224
Anyway, the woman is beautiful.
30 years old.

52
00:04:10,459 --> 00:04:13,006
Bruce is 54, his wife 30 years old.

53
00:04:13,126 --> 00:04:14,331
Congratulations, but...

54
00:04:18,663 --> 00:04:21,934
Doctors said, "Be careful on
the honeymoon. You could die hard."

55
00:04:31,181 --> 00:04:33,763
That certainly was worth the trouble,
wasn't it?

56
00:04:36,904 --> 00:04:38,027
It's the cough again.

57
00:04:39,206 --> 00:04:41,946
You know about this weasel,
this rodent Bernie Madoff?

58
00:04:42,471 --> 00:04:46,916
Who's in prison now for 150 years,
because he swindled billions?

59
00:04:47,036 --> 00:04:49,893
50, 60 billions
from old people and charities?

60
00:04:50,013 --> 00:04:54,526
This guy swindled 65 billion, and they
sentenced him to 150 years in prison,

61
00:04:54,791 --> 00:04:57,557
but somehow, it's not satisfying, is it?

62
00:04:57,677 --> 00:05:00,482
It's not satisfying.
150 years prison, and, you know,

63
00:05:00,602 --> 00:05:02,795
when he comes out, they think
the recession will be better, but...

64
00:05:05,527 --> 00:05:08,671
And I got a call from Roger Goodell
at the NFL earlier today,

65
00:05:08,706 --> 00:05:10,064
and he said, "You know,
here's what we're trying to do

66
00:05:10,184 --> 00:05:11,525
for halftime at the Superbowl next year.

67
00:05:11,645 --> 00:05:15,592
We'll get that Bernie Madoff out there,
and we'll let victims come down there,

68
00:05:15,712 --> 00:05:18,669
and they'll bring hefty bags
full of their own urine,

69
00:05:18,789 --> 00:05:24,118
and we'll put him right there at
the 50-yard line, and people can line up..."

70
00:05:25,329 --> 00:05:26,036
Poof him with the...

71
00:05:27,208 --> 00:05:28,288
Poof him with the big bags.

72
00:05:28,408 --> 00:05:30,367
And I said, "Why are you calling me?"

73
00:05:36,278 --> 00:05:37,652
But anyway, now-- No, wait a minute.

74
00:05:39,695 --> 00:05:43,220
It turns out now that Bernie Madoff's
accountant was also arrested.

75
00:05:43,340 --> 00:05:45,778
This guy's also arrested. Yeah, what a pair.

76
00:05:45,898 --> 00:05:47,598
Bernie and his accountant.
And you know what else?

77
00:05:47,718 --> 00:05:50,927
They were planning to put together
a musical about the life of Adolf Hitler.

78
00:05:51,182 --> 00:05:51,990
These guys.

79
00:05:54,219 --> 00:05:54,818
Wow.

80
00:06:01,565 --> 00:06:04,864
Yeah, Bernie's in prison right now,
and at this very minute,

81
00:06:04,984 --> 00:06:07,594
he's tapping out stock tips on the plumbing.

82
00:06:11,624 --> 00:06:13,459
How does Bruce Willis' wife
spell her last name?

83
00:06:13,579 --> 00:06:14,355
Does anybody know?

84
00:06:15,221 --> 00:06:16,348
- With an M?
- With an M.

85
00:06:16,468 --> 00:06:17,542
Yeah, fine. Thank you.

86
00:06:19,751 --> 00:06:21,886
Bernie, though, wants to
be a model prisoner today.

87
00:06:22,006 --> 00:06:23,545
He was teaching his Ponzi class.

88
00:06:27,894 --> 00:06:29,225
I want to tell you something,
ladies and gentlemen.

89
00:06:29,345 --> 00:06:32,096
Maybe you noticed this already.
If I seem in a bad mood tonight,

90
00:06:32,216 --> 00:06:34,992
it's because CBS just
declared me a toxic asset.

91
00:06:38,279 --> 00:06:38,895
That's right.

92
00:06:40,813 --> 00:06:43,425
The Obama administration.
Are you aware of this now?

93
00:06:43,545 --> 00:06:47,719
They wanna unload
a trillion dollars in toxic assets.

94
00:06:48,023 --> 00:06:49,609
I don't know what that means. A trillion--

95
00:06:49,644 --> 00:06:51,359
But do you know how much
a trillion dollars is?

96
00:06:51,617 --> 00:06:53,502
A trillion dollars,
you put them all together,

97
00:06:53,622 --> 00:06:56,196
that's almost as much as the AIG bonuses.

98
00:06:56,316 --> 00:06:58,171
A trillion dollars, just about...

99
00:07:00,430 --> 00:07:01,198
Please.

100
00:07:08,298 --> 00:07:10,297
Do you folks have March Madness?

101
00:07:10,565 --> 00:07:12,014
Do you-- Feeling a little March Madness?

102
00:07:15,696 --> 00:07:17,778
And you know, this weekend now,

103
00:07:17,898 --> 00:07:20,474
the teams are all focused on
getting to the Sweet Sixteen.

104
00:07:20,509 --> 00:07:22,536
It's the same goal as Octomom.

105
00:07:24,123 --> 00:07:24,921
Really?

106
00:07:26,260 --> 00:07:27,387
Octomom.

107
00:07:30,957 --> 00:07:32,469
By the way, did you read about this?

108
00:07:33,117 --> 00:07:38,171
Octomom says she will never reveal
the identity of the octuplets' father.

109
00:07:38,612 --> 00:07:43,242
Never reveal the identity of the guy
who is the father of the octuplets, Octodad.

110
00:07:43,362 --> 00:07:45,422
Will never reveal...

111
00:07:45,542 --> 00:07:47,903
And I thought, well, at least
she can keep her mouth shut.

112
00:07:50,218 --> 00:07:50,924
Wait a minute.

113
00:07:52,343 --> 00:07:53,405
Who said that?

114
00:07:54,816 --> 00:07:55,886
Who said that?

115
00:08:02,972 --> 00:08:05,822
Anybody see the president
last night on <i>60 Minutes</i>?

116
00:08:08,288 --> 00:08:12,152
And, he's getting a little loopy,
and who can blame him?

117
00:08:12,809 --> 00:08:14,675
Because when the guy
came into office, first of all,

118
00:08:14,710 --> 00:08:16,789
the campaign to become president,

119
00:08:16,824 --> 00:08:19,547
I mean, that lasted seven, eight years.

120
00:08:21,051 --> 00:08:24,210
And then he becomes president,
doesn't really get time off,

121
00:08:24,245 --> 00:08:26,746
and he's gotta sit through that parade
on inauguration day,

122
00:08:26,866 --> 00:08:29,072
and that lasted another three, four hours.

123
00:08:29,731 --> 00:08:32,715
And so he's exhausted,
and he's loopy so on <i>60 Minutes</i> last night,

124
00:08:32,750 --> 00:08:35,606
he was a little bit giddy,
and people are now saying,

125
00:08:35,726 --> 00:08:37,494
"Now, wait a minute. Is this guy--"

126
00:08:37,529 --> 00:08:39,879
First of all, I wouldn't give
this guy's troubles to...

127
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:42,424
- a monkey on a rock.
- A monkey on a rock.

128
00:08:44,282 --> 00:08:47,233
But people are saying,
"Is he taking things seriously?"

129
00:08:47,268 --> 00:08:48,236
Well, here. Take a look.

130
00:08:48,271 --> 00:08:51,533
Oh, no. There's gotta be a little
gallows humor through the day.

131
00:08:51,874 --> 00:08:54,810
You know, sometimes my
team talks about the fact

132
00:08:54,845 --> 00:08:57,371
that if you had said to us a year ago..."

133
00:08:58,356 --> 00:08:59,822
Got a thing... Did you see it? Is he...

134
00:09:00,236 --> 00:09:01,109
Yeah, I don't know.

135
00:09:10,264 --> 00:09:13,593
And now, here's the example
of political nitpicking.

136
00:09:13,628 --> 00:09:17,421
Because nobody really knew how
to criticize what the president is doing.

137
00:09:17,456 --> 00:09:20,473
Because first of all,
the task ahead of him is impossible.

138
00:09:20,593 --> 00:09:22,295
And, you know,
he's at least out there trying.

139
00:09:22,330 --> 00:09:23,760
So what really can you say wrong?

140
00:09:23,880 --> 00:09:28,943
Listen to this. Critics are now criticizing
his overuse of the teleprompter.

141
00:09:31,781 --> 00:09:35,038
Okay, maybe he should
think about stepping down.

142
00:09:37,243 --> 00:09:40,152
Overuse of the teleprompter.
So we put together a piece here tonight.

143
00:09:40,187 --> 00:09:44,480
It's entitled
"Teleprompter vs. No Teleprompter."

144
00:09:44,515 --> 00:09:45,116
Take a look.

145
00:09:49,209 --> 00:09:51,361
This was the time when we performed.

146
00:09:51,655 --> 00:09:54,544
In the words that are
carved into this very chamber.

147
00:09:55,361 --> 00:09:57,505
"Something worthy to be remembered."

148
00:10:01,070 --> 00:10:01,724
I mean...

149
00:10:03,853 --> 00:10:05,635
Tell people why I say... I mean is it...

150
00:10:06,551 --> 00:10:10,132
This has been
"Teleprompter vs. No Teleprompter."

151
00:10:12,344 --> 00:10:14,714
That's exactly what I'm talking about.

152
00:10:14,834 --> 00:10:16,627
There, ladies and gentlemen, Paul Shaffer.

153
00:10:16,662 --> 00:10:17,854
Say hello to my buddy Paul.

154
00:10:17,889 --> 00:10:19,600
Thank you, David.
It's exactly what I'm talking about.

155
00:10:19,635 --> 00:10:21,042
A two, three.

156
00:10:26,287 --> 00:10:29,793
Oh, what a show.
We'll be right back with Hugh Laurie.

157
00:10:30,051 --> 00:10:33,046
Coming up after the break, Hugh Laurie.

158
00:10:47,805 --> 00:10:50,828
I don't know if you remember
last fall during football season.

159
00:10:50,948 --> 00:10:53,862
We're all excited about
the Ball State fighting football Cardinals.

160
00:10:54,237 --> 00:10:57,220
Because they had an undefeated record
during the regular season,

161
00:10:57,255 --> 00:11:00,299
and they did not win their conference,
but came very close.

162
00:11:00,419 --> 00:11:02,723
And then they went to some Bowl,
and then they got beat in the Bowl,

163
00:11:02,758 --> 00:11:03,706
and they're coach left.

164
00:11:03,826 --> 00:11:06,615
And what's turned out to be a--
started out to be a happy, lovely story,

165
00:11:06,650 --> 00:11:08,167
turned out to be rather ugly, frankly.

166
00:11:10,265 --> 00:11:15,740
Well, listen to this. Ball State
women's basketball, talk about a program,

167
00:11:15,860 --> 00:11:22,246
knocked off Tennessee 71-55,
and they're going to the NCAA final weekend.

168
00:11:24,081 --> 00:11:26,000
The fighting Lady Cardinals.

169
00:11:29,744 --> 00:11:33,478
So congratulations,
and hats off, and way to go.

170
00:11:33,598 --> 00:11:37,590
And my other tourney pick,
I predicted Butler would go all the way,

171
00:11:37,625 --> 00:11:39,297
and meet Louisville in the final.

172
00:11:40,759 --> 00:11:42,492
Butler was defeated in the first game.

173
00:11:44,418 --> 00:11:46,849
But we have a guy here
in a Hoosiers sweatshirt.

174
00:11:47,798 --> 00:11:50,215
Does that mean anything to anybody? No.

175
00:11:56,436 --> 00:11:58,783
Now here's a book, ladies and gentlemen.

176
00:11:58,903 --> 00:12:02,670
It won't solve all your problems,
but once you solve this problem,

177
00:12:02,790 --> 00:12:05,855
you'll be able to take care of
the rest of the problems in your life.

178
00:12:05,975 --> 00:12:08,704
And that's weight loss. Have you
ever tried to lose any weight?

179
00:12:09,079 --> 00:12:12,450
It's impossible. I'll tell you what
I tried a couple of weeks ago.

180
00:12:12,570 --> 00:12:14,647
Pancakes. You ever tried pancakes?

181
00:12:16,033 --> 00:12:19,099
I mean, call the cops,
because you have them,

182
00:12:19,134 --> 00:12:21,111
and you put a little butter,
and a little syrup on them,

183
00:12:21,146 --> 00:12:22,963
and you have a stack of like a dozen...

184
00:12:25,873 --> 00:12:28,555
Well, that's the problem.
But we got a guy on.

185
00:12:28,590 --> 00:12:30,496
Our good friend, the man who saved my life,

186
00:12:30,616 --> 00:12:34,733
Dr. Lou Aronne wrote this book,
and in a minute, he's gonna come out here,

187
00:12:34,853 --> 00:12:36,948
and make him feel at home, because he's got

188
00:12:37,068 --> 00:12:39,953
a nice bright, white, crisp lab coat on.

189
00:12:41,389 --> 00:12:43,196
And he couldn't look cuter.

190
00:12:44,507 --> 00:12:46,338
And he gonna come out,
we're gonna talk about the book,

191
00:12:46,458 --> 00:12:53,390
then George Clarke,
our building engineer, is on this program,

192
00:12:53,425 --> 00:12:56,484
and Lou started him on the program
two weeks ago on this very show,

193
00:12:56,604 --> 00:12:59,708
and we're gonna find out
how much weight George has lost.

194
00:12:59,828 --> 00:13:03,871
George was 257. But now Dr. Lou,
the author of this book,

195
00:13:03,906 --> 00:13:07,710
put him on the Dr. Lou regimen, and
we'll just see in a couple of minutes here,

196
00:13:07,830 --> 00:13:10,185
how George Clarke did
in the last couple of weeks.

197
00:13:10,305 --> 00:13:12,200
It's impossible,
as you know, to lose weight.

198
00:13:12,320 --> 00:13:15,459
But Dr. Lou, and wait 'til you
get a look at the lab coat.

199
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:19,492
Now here we go. Get ready.

200
00:13:19,527 --> 00:13:21,469
Because this is something
you're gonna tell your kids about.

201
00:13:23,114 --> 00:13:28,458
On Saturday, March 21, 2009, on
Parrot Cay in the Turks and Caicos Islands,

202
00:13:28,493 --> 00:13:33,081
Bruce Willis was married to
British model Emma Heming with an M.

203
00:13:35,077 --> 00:13:37,203
They've been dating for just over a year,

204
00:13:37,238 --> 00:13:40,195
and they plan to have a civil ceremony
when they return to California.

205
00:13:40,315 --> 00:13:43,588
So congratulations,
and we couldn't be happier for Bruce.

206
00:13:51,947 --> 00:13:55,721
Okay, that was Saturday on Parrot Cay
in the Turks and Caicos Islands.

207
00:13:55,841 --> 00:14:00,076
Now, on Thursday, at 3 p.m., March 19, 2009

208
00:14:00,111 --> 00:14:03,772
at the Teton County Courthouse
in Choteau, Montana,

209
00:14:04,031 --> 00:14:06,439
I was married to Regina Lasko.

210
00:14:10,431 --> 00:14:14,136
He's not kidding! He did it!

211
00:14:20,340 --> 00:14:24,834
Congratulations!
Congratulations! You did it!

212
00:14:31,286 --> 00:14:32,219
All right, now.

213
00:14:32,853 --> 00:14:33,968
He finally did it!

214
00:14:35,659 --> 00:14:36,550
Finally did it.

215
00:14:37,540 --> 00:14:40,347
Now let me give you
the tale of the tape on this. We--

216
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:42,829
Regina and I began-- All right!

217
00:14:46,082 --> 00:14:47,549
It's a little bit of a surprise.

218
00:14:47,669 --> 00:14:51,583
We, Regina and I began dating February 1986.

219
00:14:51,703 --> 00:14:54,644
That's what I mean. That's what I mean.

220
00:14:54,881 --> 00:14:58,396
And I said, "Well, things are
going pretty good. Let's just...

221
00:14:59,479 --> 00:15:01,396
see what happens in about ten years."

222
00:15:02,723 --> 00:15:05,306
We have a five-and-a-half year old
son named Harry.

223
00:15:05,426 --> 00:15:07,644
Yes, you do.

224
00:15:14,157 --> 00:15:18,394
Justice of the Peace John L. "Pete" Howard
performed the civil service.

225
00:15:18,514 --> 00:15:20,567
So, there you go.
That's it, ladies and gentlemen.

226
00:15:20,602 --> 00:15:22,954
That is beautiful. Congratulations.

227
00:15:30,254 --> 00:15:37,481
And people say, "Jeez, Dave.
You were together so long,

228
00:15:37,516 --> 00:15:38,698
does it feel any different?"

229
00:15:39,075 --> 00:15:41,059
And I say, "Yeah."

230
00:15:49,071 --> 00:15:50,826
Yes, it... It does.

231
00:15:56,069 --> 00:15:59,021
Oh, my God. So what
a big weekend that was for me.

232
00:15:59,056 --> 00:16:02,287
And I don't know what else
to tell you, but here we go.

233
00:16:08,449 --> 00:16:08,965
Please.

234
00:16:14,407 --> 00:16:16,786
They say, "Well, why did it take
you so long to get married?"

235
00:16:16,821 --> 00:16:18,597
And, of course, the answer honestly is,

236
00:16:18,717 --> 00:16:21,407
we wanted to make sure
we had the prenup just right.

237
00:16:24,350 --> 00:16:25,466
It's too late for that.

238
00:16:27,920 --> 00:16:30,810
So what do we got here?
Bernie Madoff is in prison,

239
00:16:31,056 --> 00:16:34,480
and people have been wondering
how he spent his time under house arrest.

240
00:16:34,515 --> 00:16:36,982
Oh, my God. That's right.
Before he went to prison,

241
00:16:37,102 --> 00:16:38,998
they had him locked up
in his penthouse apartment.

242
00:16:39,118 --> 00:16:41,489
Well, we have some rare footage

243
00:16:43,086 --> 00:16:47,935
of Bernie and his lovely wife Ruth at home
during those months of house arrest.

244
00:16:47,970 --> 00:16:48,703
Watch this.

245
00:17:06,941 --> 00:17:07,868
How can I help you?

246
00:17:07,903 --> 00:17:09,379
Package for Madoff. Sign here.

247
00:17:14,323 --> 00:17:15,030
Have a nice day.

248
00:17:15,489 --> 00:17:16,781
Yeah, you too.

249
00:17:19,411 --> 00:17:21,540
I just love being an ass--

250
00:17:27,380 --> 00:17:33,473
Okay. We'll be right back with
Dr. Lou Aronne, ladies and gentlemen.

251
00:17:42,633 --> 00:17:44,381
Thank you. Beautiful, Felicia.

252
00:17:47,767 --> 00:17:48,277
Thank you.

253
00:17:48,312 --> 00:17:52,380
And I avoided getting married
pretty good for like 23 years.

254
00:17:53,569 --> 00:17:55,545
And I honestly,
whether this happened or not,

255
00:17:55,580 --> 00:18:00,250
I secretly felt that men
who were married admired me.

256
00:18:02,804 --> 00:18:04,312
You know? Like I was...

257
00:18:11,798 --> 00:18:15,413
Like I was the last of the real
gun slingers. You know what I'm saying?

258
00:18:16,901 --> 00:18:20,987
So now, we get ready to go, and we
gotta drive into the courthouse,

259
00:18:21,234 --> 00:18:24,047
and it's muddy.
And we're supposed to be there at 2.

260
00:18:24,294 --> 00:18:28,474
So it's me, Regina and Harry
in the truck. In the pickup truck.

261
00:18:30,534 --> 00:18:33,709
I know Bruce Willis is saying,
"What, it's like I have a twin."

262
00:18:35,696 --> 00:18:38,965
So we get two miles from the house,
and we get stuck in the mud.

263
00:18:39,185 --> 00:18:41,921
I mean "turn the truck over"
stuck in the mud.

264
00:18:42,041 --> 00:18:42,841
Oh, no.

265
00:18:43,115 --> 00:18:45,139
So now, we think,
"Well, somebody will come..."

266
00:18:45,174 --> 00:18:47,396
No. Nobody comes along. Nobody comes along.

267
00:18:47,431 --> 00:18:49,376
It's Thursday afternoon. Who's coming along?

268
00:18:49,411 --> 00:18:51,084
Zorro? No. Nobody.

269
00:18:52,631 --> 00:18:58,002
So I get out of the truck, and I walk
two miles back to the house.

270
00:18:59,129 --> 00:19:01,172
Into a fifty-mile-an-hour wind.

271
00:19:01,292 --> 00:19:05,994
It's not Beverly Hills.
It's Montana for God's sakes.

272
00:19:06,029 --> 00:19:07,129
- Wow.
- And the whole way

273
00:19:07,164 --> 00:19:08,816
I'm thinking, "See, smart ass?"

274
00:19:09,251 --> 00:19:13,291
See? You try and get married,
this is what happens? See?

275
00:19:13,887 --> 00:19:15,692
Well you got nobody to blame but yourself.

276
00:19:16,167 --> 00:19:18,275
Could've happened any other day,
but you wait now.

277
00:19:18,310 --> 00:19:19,421
See? This is what you get."

278
00:19:19,786 --> 00:19:24,023
So then we get in the car, and Harry says,
"Are we still going into town?"

279
00:19:24,143 --> 00:19:26,445
And I said, "Yes we are."
And he gets very upset.

280
00:19:26,480 --> 00:19:30,436
Because Mom had told him if I wasn't back
in an hour, the deal was off.

281
00:19:38,377 --> 00:19:43,702
Oh, no. We're going into town!
We're going to town!

282
00:19:46,073 --> 00:19:50,241
Sit back there and be quiet!
Oh, no! We're going to town!

283
00:19:58,896 --> 00:20:01,359
Here, ladies and gentlemen.
I talked about this earlier,

284
00:20:01,479 --> 00:20:02,850
and we're gonna have the weight-in.

285
00:20:02,970 --> 00:20:05,332
George Clarke, two weeks ago--
Now we'll see what he did.

286
00:20:05,452 --> 00:20:07,035
I don't know what's going on back there.

287
00:20:07,270 --> 00:20:10,886
So not just George, his family, his health,

288
00:20:11,006 --> 00:20:15,549
but the career of this man right here,
Dr. Lou Aronne, are in the balance.

289
00:20:15,584 --> 00:20:17,734
Raise the thing, and let's go back there,
ladies and gentlemen,

290
00:20:17,769 --> 00:20:19,209
and see what's happening. Here we go.

291
00:20:21,933 --> 00:20:23,076
- Hello. How are you?
- How're you doing?

292
00:20:23,111 --> 00:20:23,875
Congratulations.

293
00:20:29,063 --> 00:20:32,155
What do you think? Huh? What did I tell you?

294
00:20:37,862 --> 00:20:38,793
George, how're you doing?

295
00:20:38,828 --> 00:20:39,380
Good, sir.

296
00:20:39,415 --> 00:20:42,235
How long you been on the diet
here with Dr. Lou?

297
00:20:42,355 --> 00:20:43,025
Little over two weeks.

298
00:20:43,145 --> 00:20:46,397
Two weeks, and you're a guy
who really liked to eat before,

299
00:20:46,517 --> 00:20:49,018
and would eat with abandon.
Is that accurate?

300
00:20:49,312 --> 00:20:50,180
Correct, sir.

301
00:20:50,450 --> 00:20:52,655
And so now, it's kind of a radical change.

302
00:20:52,775 --> 00:20:54,837
Was it so radical for you,
making this change?

303
00:20:55,541 --> 00:20:57,699
It was tough for the first three days.

304
00:20:58,253 --> 00:21:00,496
Did you feel yourself kinda
a little lightheaded?

305
00:21:00,616 --> 00:21:01,788
A little weak in the knees?

306
00:21:02,351 --> 00:21:03,173
Yes.

307
00:21:04,152 --> 00:21:07,167
What would you do when you
got lightheaded, and weak in the knees?

308
00:21:07,287 --> 00:21:10,503
Well, Dr. Lou told me
to have some chicken broth.

309
00:21:10,623 --> 00:21:12,392
Chicken broth? Good. Good.

310
00:21:12,688 --> 00:21:15,770
And am I correct? You're trying
to lose weight off your knees?

311
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:16,774
Is that what it is?

312
00:21:18,846 --> 00:21:21,561
And again, this is an
exact replication of Lou's office.

313
00:21:21,681 --> 00:21:22,592
So if you see him...

314
00:21:25,584 --> 00:21:26,699
- Same thing.
- Same thing.

315
00:21:27,132 --> 00:21:29,996
All right. This book, by the way,
will be in stores tomorrow.

316
00:21:30,031 --> 00:21:30,843
- Is that correct?
- That's correct.

317
00:21:30,963 --> 00:21:33,805
And it's going to be-- I'm telling you--
will be an instant best-seller.

318
00:21:33,925 --> 00:21:36,410
But you know, George.
It's not just you and your welfare,

319
00:21:36,530 --> 00:21:38,594
and the health, and concern of your family,

320
00:21:38,900 --> 00:21:40,935
but Lou has put his life on the line, here.

321
00:21:41,055 --> 00:21:42,405
- I know.
- Okay.

322
00:21:42,525 --> 00:21:45,087
So last week, how much was it?
Two weeks ago, it was what?

323
00:21:45,122 --> 00:21:46,303
- 257.
- 257.

324
00:21:46,423 --> 00:21:48,593
What would you expect
in two weeks on this procedure?

325
00:21:48,839 --> 00:21:50,964
I think he could probably lose ten pounds.

326
00:21:51,084 --> 00:21:52,640
Ten pounds. All right. Okay. You ready?

327
00:21:53,157 --> 00:21:53,895
Hop right up there.

328
00:22:06,332 --> 00:22:09,168
- What is that? 12 pounds?
- 11 pounds.

329
00:22:09,203 --> 00:22:11,908
11 pounds. 11 pounds. Congratulations.

330
00:22:12,028 --> 00:22:13,442
- Thank you, boss.
- Wow.

331
00:22:15,327 --> 00:22:16,398
Lou, you want to get on the scales?

332
00:22:16,433 --> 00:22:17,176
Oh, no.

333
00:22:20,718 --> 00:22:23,157
Well, this is the... How long
is he gonna be on the thing.

334
00:22:23,277 --> 00:22:24,261
For weeks.

335
00:22:24,561 --> 00:22:27,151
And what is your target weight?

336
00:22:27,186 --> 00:22:28,541
About, what? 210?

337
00:22:28,843 --> 00:22:32,158
We think if he could lose
20, 30, you said 40 pounds?

338
00:22:32,278 --> 00:22:33,500
I think he'd feel great.

339
00:22:33,620 --> 00:22:36,970
We want to get his waist down
to less than 40 inches. That's our goal.

340
00:22:37,090 --> 00:22:38,156
What is his waist now?

341
00:22:38,531 --> 00:22:43,497
His waist right now-- He started at 49.
He's down significantly low.

342
00:22:43,532 --> 00:22:44,821
He's lost three inches from his waist.

343
00:22:44,941 --> 00:22:46,315
Three inches off his waist,
ladies and gentlemen.

344
00:22:47,310 --> 00:22:50,203
There it is. <i>The Skinny on
Losing Weight Without Being Hungry</i>.

345
00:22:50,323 --> 00:22:53,347
Nice job, Dr. Lou.
We'll see you soon. Nice job, Lou.

346
00:22:53,980 --> 00:22:56,480
We'll be right back with Hugh Laurie,
ladies and gentlemen.

347
00:23:14,225 --> 00:23:18,925
Our first guest tonight stars as
the voice of Dr. Cockroach, Ph.D.

348
00:23:19,045 --> 00:23:23,725
in the new animated film entitled
<i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>. It opens Friday.

349
00:23:23,845 --> 00:23:27,363
Please welcome the very talented
Hugh Laurie, ladies and gentlemen.

350
00:23:45,041 --> 00:23:47,143
- How you doing?
- I'm doing very well, thank you.

351
00:23:47,263 --> 00:23:49,578
Good to have you with us again.
Thank you for being here.

352
00:23:49,698 --> 00:23:50,419
It's very good to be here.

353
00:23:50,539 --> 00:23:54,367
Do you remember-- And, of course,
I'm sure you're in New York City frequently.

354
00:23:54,487 --> 00:23:56,475
Work and so forth, travel back and forth?

355
00:23:57,422 --> 00:24:00,732
No. I would say, no. I come here
in my dreams obviously all the time.

356
00:24:00,852 --> 00:24:02,741
- Really?
- But in reality, less often.

357
00:24:02,776 --> 00:24:04,367
What was it like the first time?

358
00:24:04,402 --> 00:24:06,436
- Remember your first time?
- My first time was...

359
00:24:06,556 --> 00:24:09,451
Yes, the first time I came
was when we shot <i>Stuart Little</i>.

360
00:24:09,486 --> 00:24:11,015
I was in a film called <i>Stuart Little</i>.

361
00:24:11,050 --> 00:24:15,192
We shot for a couple of months
in New York which I absolutely adored.

362
00:24:15,312 --> 00:24:17,730
I actually spent two months
living at the Plaza Hotel.

363
00:24:17,850 --> 00:24:20,783
- Well, very good for you.
- I was like a little Elouise.

364
00:24:22,576 --> 00:24:26,025
Although, I actually did-- That was
not my intention when I came.

365
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:31,250
An American friend of mine recommended
a very, sort of, British hotel that...

366
00:24:31,990 --> 00:24:35,200
It certainly was very British.
It was that kind of Britishness

367
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:37,637
that all you lot left Britain
to come to America for.

368
00:24:39,089 --> 00:24:40,854
It was absolutely a miserable hotel.

369
00:24:40,889 --> 00:24:43,396
- Oh, sure.
- And it felt like someone had died

370
00:24:43,431 --> 00:24:45,460
in the room about an hour before I moved in.

371
00:24:46,162 --> 00:24:49,154
And I thought to myself, "I cannot
stay in this place. I have to leave."

372
00:24:49,274 --> 00:24:51,666
But it was about midnight so
I can't go traipsing around the city.

373
00:24:51,786 --> 00:24:54,670
So I went downstairs,
and I hailed a cab. I thought,

374
00:24:54,705 --> 00:24:57,853
"I'll have just one night at the Plaza,
and then I'll find somewhere tomorrow."

375
00:24:57,888 --> 00:25:00,075
And I hailed a cab,
and I said, "The Plaza Hotel."

376
00:25:00,486 --> 00:25:02,050
And the guy said, "What are you nuts?"

377
00:25:02,764 --> 00:25:05,278
And I said, "No--" Well, "Hello."

378
00:25:07,337 --> 00:25:08,928
"Do you want to go to the Plaza?"

379
00:25:09,048 --> 00:25:11,063
And I said,
"Yes. It's a good hotel, isn't it?"

380
00:25:11,183 --> 00:25:14,184
"The Plaza Hotel is a very good hotel.
It ranks amongst the finest."

381
00:25:14,517 --> 00:25:20,968
"Well then take me thither,
young man, with all due speed."

382
00:25:21,224 --> 00:25:24,734
So he then drove his cab about 12 feet.

383
00:25:31,168 --> 00:25:32,131
- There you go.
- I could've...

384
00:25:33,317 --> 00:25:35,870
I could've gone in one side, and out
the other. Would've been just as good.

385
00:25:35,990 --> 00:25:38,707
So then, of course, I had to make up
a story about how I had a bad back.

386
00:25:38,742 --> 00:25:40,922
- I see.
- And that's why I couldn't lift my case.

387
00:25:41,205 --> 00:25:43,567
You're lucky he didn't take
you to LaGuardia and back.

388
00:25:44,106 --> 00:25:46,324
All right, there it is.
That'll be 80 dollars, thank you.

389
00:25:47,756 --> 00:25:50,844
But speaking of things English,
you received one of these--

390
00:25:51,112 --> 00:25:54,869
And I don't know how often they're
giving out these knighthoods, or...

391
00:25:54,989 --> 00:25:57,372
What are they, BSEs or BOEs or...

392
00:25:58,391 --> 00:26:03,967
It's called an OBE. It's like a very,
very junior knighthood.

393
00:26:04,087 --> 00:26:07,586
It's like the first part of your kit
on your way to getting a knighthood.

394
00:26:08,384 --> 00:26:09,265
And the initials...

395
00:26:09,300 --> 00:26:10,983
So they're like action figures
you have to collect.

396
00:26:11,018 --> 00:26:17,023
It's a sort of... I'm technically an
Officer of the Order of the British Empire.

397
00:26:17,760 --> 00:26:19,402
Well, very impressive.

398
00:26:22,525 --> 00:26:27,293
Again, that would be something
you all came here to avoid.

399
00:26:27,796 --> 00:26:30,120
And how do you know about this? Are you...

400
00:26:31,025 --> 00:26:32,153
You campaigned for it?

401
00:26:32,735 --> 00:26:36,288
No. No, I don't think so.

402
00:26:37,688 --> 00:26:40,980
No, I just... It arrives in the...
In fact, they ask you,

403
00:26:41,100 --> 00:26:43,357
if you were to be offered,
would you accept it.

404
00:26:43,843 --> 00:26:46,009
And there were very, sort of,
mixed feelings in Britain.

405
00:26:46,277 --> 00:26:52,781
Some people think it's a vestige
of an antiquated imperial system.

406
00:26:52,816 --> 00:26:53,992
Why would they think that?

407
00:26:56,039 --> 00:26:57,770
And others think that,
you know, it's just a...

408
00:26:58,308 --> 00:27:00,902
I actually asked my son--
My was 16 at the time.

409
00:27:00,937 --> 00:27:03,414
I said, "Do you think I should take--
Is it a good thing or not?"

410
00:27:03,449 --> 00:27:06,691
He said, "You'd have to be so
up yourself not to take this."

411
00:27:07,228 --> 00:27:09,326
- So, I...
- There you go. From a 16-year-old.

412
00:27:09,361 --> 00:27:11,042
That was a very healthy response.

413
00:27:11,077 --> 00:27:15,654
But it's interesting to me that they
mention in the congratulations,

414
00:27:15,689 --> 00:27:18,413
"You've been awarded the OBE.
Are you interested?"

415
00:27:18,749 --> 00:27:22,123
It just seems like, well,
if you're worthy to be awarded,

416
00:27:22,243 --> 00:27:23,767
it doesn't make any difference
whether you're interested or not,

417
00:27:23,887 --> 00:27:25,384
- you get it.
- You take it.

418
00:27:25,504 --> 00:27:27,455
You take it and be grateful.
You'd think, wouldn't you?

419
00:27:27,575 --> 00:27:30,742
I suppose they just don't want
a lot of "Nah, thanks. I won't..."

420
00:27:31,115 --> 00:27:32,041
They're trying to avoid that.

421
00:27:32,076 --> 00:27:33,119
You think they do get that?

422
00:27:33,239 --> 00:27:35,916
I don't know, actually.
Because they... It's possible.

423
00:27:36,036 --> 00:27:38,138
It's possible. But I took it,
and I went along, and I...

424
00:27:38,452 --> 00:27:40,057
And there's the big thing,
and the Queen is there.

425
00:27:40,092 --> 00:27:41,185
Big thing with the trumpets, and...

426
00:27:41,305 --> 00:27:43,205
- Sure.
- Tailcoats, and...

427
00:27:44,250 --> 00:27:48,387
And I met the Queen for
about four to five seconds,

428
00:27:48,798 --> 00:27:52,776
and she, sort of, completely glazed over.
I could've said absolutely anything.

429
00:27:55,092 --> 00:27:57,983
I could've propositioned her,
and she probably wouldn't even notice.

430
00:27:58,546 --> 00:28:00,812
Well, that's how you
get your award right there.

431
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:05,271
But do you... Who else was
in your class of inductees?

432
00:28:05,306 --> 00:28:09,317
Well, this is the slightly trying thing.

433
00:28:09,437 --> 00:28:13,310
The people-- There were two guys
before me who were--

434
00:28:13,714 --> 00:28:18,218
And they read out the merits
of their award before they get it.

435
00:28:18,828 --> 00:28:21,399
And these two guys were up
before me, and it was for

436
00:28:21,740 --> 00:28:26,221
defusing a bomb while
under severe enemy gunfire.

437
00:28:27,978 --> 00:28:30,032
You know, Corporal so-and-so,
and Sergeant so-and-so,

438
00:28:30,067 --> 00:28:31,371
and they get their medal.

439
00:28:31,664 --> 00:28:36,084
And then the next up,
for services to the entertainment industry.

440
00:28:37,998 --> 00:28:39,139
It's just...

441
00:28:40,419 --> 00:28:41,664
- Ouch.
- It's really...

442
00:28:46,763 --> 00:28:49,963
We each serve in our own way, don't we?

443
00:28:50,517 --> 00:28:51,506
We answer the call.

444
00:28:52,705 --> 00:28:56,241
Let's see. <i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>,
and you're Dr. Cockroach.

445
00:28:56,276 --> 00:28:57,223
Have you done...

446
00:28:58,899 --> 00:29:01,592
This movie's gotta be a hit
if your character gets a laugh.

447
00:29:01,712 --> 00:29:03,274
Dr. Cockroach, people seem to like.

448
00:29:03,309 --> 00:29:04,904
That seemed to go well so far.

449
00:29:06,157 --> 00:29:08,785
- Have you done much...
- Cockroaches? I haven't.

450
00:29:10,460 --> 00:29:13,299
Animation. So, voiceover.

451
00:29:13,334 --> 00:29:17,306
I've done some in Britain, but this is
the first time doing a big American one.

452
00:29:17,341 --> 00:29:20,479
And it was... I mean, the cockroach is...

453
00:29:21,430 --> 00:29:23,307
It's a troubling thing to be offered this,

454
00:29:23,342 --> 00:29:26,972
because you have no way of knowing
whether they had a cockroach,

455
00:29:27,092 --> 00:29:29,237
and thought, "Now who do
we get to play-- Oh, I know.

456
00:29:30,035 --> 00:29:33,559
It's that guy..." Or whether they
wanted me in the film, and they said,

457
00:29:33,594 --> 00:29:36,274
"Well, what's he gonna play?
Oh, I know. A cockroach."

458
00:29:36,309 --> 00:29:38,356
- You can't win either way.
- Neither one is good.

459
00:29:38,777 --> 00:29:41,851
Let's... This thing--
The movie opens Friday.

460
00:29:42,074 --> 00:29:44,643
And let's show a clip here, Hugh.
What are we gonna see?

461
00:29:44,678 --> 00:29:49,305
We are going to see... Reese Witherspoon
plays a 49-foot-tall woman.

462
00:29:49,722 --> 00:29:51,912
Now, do you get... Wow.

463
00:29:51,947 --> 00:29:53,179
49-foot-tall woman.

464
00:29:54,767 --> 00:29:56,180
Somebody would have to put you up to it.

465
00:30:02,089 --> 00:30:02,919
Wait a minute.

466
00:30:07,081 --> 00:30:11,954
Let's take a look. It's Hugh Laurie as
Dr. Cockroach in <i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>.

467
00:30:13,395 --> 00:30:14,605
Throw the switch, Doctor.

468
00:30:15,102 --> 00:30:16,574
But don't do the laugh.

469
00:30:16,609 --> 00:30:19,884
Now, you're going to feel
a slight pinch in the brain.

470
00:30:21,203 --> 00:30:21,690
Sorry.

471
00:30:32,957 --> 00:30:37,215
- Susan! Yoo-hoo!
- Am I small again?

472
00:30:38,148 --> 00:30:39,820
I'm afraid not, my dear.

473
00:30:44,087 --> 00:30:47,955
In fact, you may actually
have grown a couple of feet.

474
00:30:50,921 --> 00:30:52,180
Dr. Cockroach.

475
00:30:53,600 --> 00:30:54,586
Very impressive.

476
00:30:56,535 --> 00:30:58,872
I wouldn't be surprised
if you get another award.

477
00:30:58,992 --> 00:31:00,855
- You think?
- Yes, I think so.

478
00:31:01,260 --> 00:31:04,918
The film opens on Friday,
<i>Monsters vs. Aliens</i>.

479
00:31:05,038 --> 00:31:07,837
And then, also, we didn't even
mention the show, of course.

480
00:31:07,872 --> 00:31:09,010
How long have you been doing that?

481
00:31:09,264 --> 00:31:11,206
It's coming to the end of our fifth season.

482
00:31:11,241 --> 00:31:13,112
Oh, good for you.

483
00:31:14,140 --> 00:31:15,790
- Hugh Laurie, ladies and gentlemen.
- Thank you.

484
00:31:15,910 --> 00:31:17,289
Good to see you. Thank you very much, sir.

485
00:31:17,833 --> 00:31:20,192
We'll be right back
with Sarah Paulson, everybody.

486
00:31:26,742 --> 00:31:29,186
Be sure to tune in to tomorrow's Late Show.

487
00:31:29,597 --> 00:31:34,343
David is joined by Mary Tyler Moore,
<i>Gossip Girl</i>'s Blake Lively,

488
00:31:34,463 --> 00:31:37,415
and musical guest White Lies.

489
00:32:03,443 --> 00:32:06,755
Our next guest stars on
the new television series

490
00:32:06,875 --> 00:32:09,566
<i>Cupid</i>, which premieres March 31.

491
00:32:09,601 --> 00:32:13,463
Please welcome the lovely
Sarah Paulson, ladies and gentlemen.

492
00:32:26,053 --> 00:32:26,923
How are you doing?

493
00:32:26,958 --> 00:32:29,447
I'm a little nervous.

494
00:32:29,567 --> 00:32:30,965
Are you nervous? I'm sorry to hear that.

495
00:32:31,000 --> 00:32:32,028
What about? Why are you nervous.

496
00:32:32,284 --> 00:32:34,267
I'm afraid that I'm gonna have a stroke.

497
00:32:36,104 --> 00:32:39,178
Like literally.
I can't feel my fingers or my feet.

498
00:32:39,879 --> 00:32:41,579
You know we have Dr. Lou here.

499
00:32:41,614 --> 00:32:45,527
I might... I might actually...
I need his services.

500
00:32:45,647 --> 00:32:47,215
Do you have-- Do you suffer hypertension?

501
00:32:49,418 --> 00:32:50,513
In my mind, I do.

502
00:32:51,207 --> 00:32:52,006
I really...

503
00:32:52,126 --> 00:32:53,252
You're a hypochondriac.

504
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:55,103
Incredible hypochondriacal.

505
00:32:55,138 --> 00:32:58,317
We're kindred spirits.
I also am a hypochondriac.

506
00:33:00,475 --> 00:33:03,382
I do. I'm always worried
I'm about to have a stroke.

507
00:33:03,417 --> 00:33:05,659
You know? You sort of feel like
tasting pennies in your mouth?

508
00:33:06,596 --> 00:33:11,233
Now have you ever actual--
Any actual serious illnesses or disorders?

509
00:33:11,496 --> 00:33:13,955
- No, just imagined.
- Just imagined, yeah.

510
00:33:14,553 --> 00:33:17,113
See, I used to be a really,
really inveterate,

511
00:33:17,233 --> 00:33:19,141
enthusiastic hypochondriac.

512
00:33:19,436 --> 00:33:21,481
And then I had open-heart surgery.

513
00:33:22,724 --> 00:33:24,413
That pretty much knocks it right out of you.

514
00:33:25,718 --> 00:33:30,047
When you finally have something
like that, everything goes away.

515
00:33:30,301 --> 00:33:32,344
Does this manifest itself regularly?

516
00:33:32,614 --> 00:33:35,464
Yeah. I would say I was
a bit of a nervous person.

517
00:33:35,499 --> 00:33:40,363
Yes, it's not good. I mean
I'm sort of seeing spots right now.

518
00:33:41,079 --> 00:33:43,298
- Really?
- There's one there.

519
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:46,888
- And one there.
- Wow.

520
00:33:47,923 --> 00:33:49,099
Boy, this sounds awful.

521
00:33:49,673 --> 00:33:52,326
When are you at ease in your life?

522
00:33:54,280 --> 00:33:56,622
- Never.
- Really?

523
00:33:56,657 --> 00:33:58,746
Yeah, it's bad. It's really, really bad.

524
00:33:58,866 --> 00:34:00,428
You wanna feel my hand a little more?

525
00:34:00,827 --> 00:34:02,966
That's very-- That's wet, right?

526
00:34:03,001 --> 00:34:04,058
Yes it is.

527
00:34:06,216 --> 00:34:07,062
Yes it is.

528
00:34:12,024 --> 00:34:14,279
Can I drink this? 'Cos my tongue's
sticking to the roof my mouth.

529
00:34:14,314 --> 00:34:15,128
Thanks so much.

530
00:34:15,727 --> 00:34:18,201
And what will--
And I don't want to dwell on this,

531
00:34:18,321 --> 00:34:20,735
but what kind of a situation
will make this condition worse?

532
00:34:21,982 --> 00:34:25,011
I guess being on a TV show
is probably not ideal for you.

533
00:34:25,131 --> 00:34:27,412
No, that actually...
I can sort of... That I can do.

534
00:34:27,447 --> 00:34:30,148
It's bizarre. Getting on an airplane
is not good for me.

535
00:34:30,700 --> 00:34:32,002
Yeah, I get a little nervous about that.

536
00:34:32,282 --> 00:34:36,589
Especially when-- I have this ritual where
I like to talk to the pilots before I fly.

537
00:34:37,175 --> 00:34:40,378
And just a sort of going in the cockpit
and check everything out.

538
00:34:40,498 --> 00:34:42,849
Make sure it looks good to me.
Since, you know,

539
00:34:42,884 --> 00:34:45,313
I know a lot about what all those gadgets
are supposed to look like.

540
00:34:46,464 --> 00:34:47,797
But I think that they tend to, sort of,

541
00:34:47,917 --> 00:34:51,176
mistake my anxiety
for some sort of flirting.

542
00:34:51,437 --> 00:34:54,678
So, inevitably,
I will get a box of chocolates,

543
00:34:54,798 --> 00:34:59,415
or a drink sent to wherever I'm sitting,
or a note that sort of says,

544
00:34:59,535 --> 00:35:02,682
"Hey, if you wanna talk more about
your anxiety, you can call me at..."

545
00:35:03,516 --> 00:35:06,303
And it's very bizarre,
and I just sort of think,

546
00:35:06,338 --> 00:35:09,958
"Hey, sir, really. Do me a favor.
Don't be writing down little notes,

547
00:35:09,993 --> 00:35:12,388
and sending them to, like, 3C or 39D,

548
00:35:12,508 --> 00:35:14,155
because I need you to focus
on the task at hand."

549
00:35:14,275 --> 00:35:16,504
- Fly the machine.
- That's right.

550
00:35:16,624 --> 00:35:18,898
Have you taken any of these classes
where they help, sort of,

551
00:35:19,018 --> 00:35:20,825
ease your fear, your anxiety about flying?

552
00:35:20,945 --> 00:35:22,990
No, because I'm quite
attached to my anxiety.

553
00:35:24,470 --> 00:35:28,500
I'm afraid that it's my anxiety
that's actually keeping the plane aloft.

554
00:35:29,696 --> 00:35:30,176
Which is like...

555
00:35:31,028 --> 00:35:33,982
Wow, this just gets stranger and stranger.

556
00:35:35,072 --> 00:35:37,901
So this is multifaceted, isn't it?

557
00:35:38,324 --> 00:35:38,723
Oh, yeah.

558
00:35:38,843 --> 00:35:40,579
I mean, you're not kidding around.
You're not a beginner.

559
00:35:43,079 --> 00:35:45,755
Well, I'm glad you're... I hope you
didn't have a tough trip coming in.

560
00:35:45,875 --> 00:35:46,706
You came in from California?

561
00:35:46,826 --> 00:35:49,298
I didn't come in from California,
but I do often fly back and forth,

562
00:35:49,418 --> 00:35:51,153
'cos I just moved back to New York,

563
00:35:51,273 --> 00:35:55,300
and it does cause me to be on
the plane more than I'd like to be.

564
00:35:55,787 --> 00:35:59,170
See, I would like to talk to you about this,
but I don't want to be misinterpreted,

565
00:35:59,290 --> 00:36:00,355
especially now that I'm married.

566
00:36:09,884 --> 00:36:13,447
Because I think I can help a little.
I don't know that I can help completely.

567
00:36:13,482 --> 00:36:14,725
Okay. I'd love to know.

568
00:36:15,383 --> 00:36:17,838
But, you've also done theater
here in New York?

569
00:36:18,188 --> 00:36:20,859
I have done a theater in New York.
Yes, I just said, a theater.

570
00:36:20,979 --> 00:36:22,199
That happens also when you're nervous.

571
00:36:22,319 --> 00:36:23,199
Well, that's all right.

572
00:36:23,319 --> 00:36:24,894
You say "a", when you're not
supposed to say "a theater."

573
00:36:25,014 --> 00:36:25,786
It's kind of hip, actually.

574
00:36:25,906 --> 00:36:26,948
- Sure.
- The theater.

575
00:36:28,898 --> 00:36:31,577
I did a play recently that was
directed by Kathleen Turner.

576
00:36:32,011 --> 00:36:34,266
Which is a sort of wonderful experience.

577
00:36:34,386 --> 00:36:36,490
She's really great,
but she has that very recognizable...

578
00:36:36,610 --> 00:36:38,908
Her voice seems to be getting
deeper and deeper and deeper.

579
00:36:40,343 --> 00:36:42,888
It does in fact, and every night
before I go on stage,

580
00:36:43,008 --> 00:36:45,385
she had sort of recorded
the announcement

581
00:36:45,505 --> 00:36:47,512
that suggest the audience
to turn off their cell phone.

582
00:36:47,632 --> 00:36:49,631
So every night
before I got on stage, I hear,

583
00:36:50,077 --> 00:36:53,591
"Ladies and gentlemen,
please turn off your cell phones.

584
00:36:54,206 --> 00:36:57,817
If you have any gum or candy,
please unwrap it now."

585
00:37:02,660 --> 00:37:03,737
Very strong.

586
00:37:07,854 --> 00:37:09,116
Do you do any other impressions?

587
00:37:09,236 --> 00:37:11,559
- I do.
- What else do you have?

588
00:37:11,979 --> 00:37:14,172
- I have Holly Hunter.
- Holly Hunter. Okay.

589
00:37:15,444 --> 00:37:17,786
Dave, listen. It's great. I mean,
I thought you were great.

590
00:37:17,821 --> 00:37:21,245
I mean, I am so excited to be here.
My show <i>Saving Grace</i>, it's a great show.

591
00:37:21,848 --> 00:37:23,357
And, I mean, it's great.

592
00:37:23,477 --> 00:37:25,594
I love this audience,
everyone's great. You're great.

593
00:37:26,403 --> 00:37:27,389
Also very good.

594
00:37:33,670 --> 00:37:35,892
A dolphin, is that right? Is that a dolphin?

595
00:37:38,258 --> 00:37:39,316
Would you like to see that one?

596
00:37:39,546 --> 00:37:40,024
Okay.

597
00:37:44,198 --> 00:37:46,628
Wow. Do that in the cockpit.
Everything'll be good.

598
00:37:48,232 --> 00:37:51,743
And finally... And this--
I like this because it's a little...

599
00:37:52,431 --> 00:37:54,275
I mean, this is a specialty impression.

600
00:37:54,650 --> 00:37:58,178
Julia Roberts, but Julia Roberts smiling.

601
00:37:58,298 --> 00:37:58,788
Is that correct?

602
00:37:58,908 --> 00:38:01,396
- And from the side.
- Smiling and from the side.

603
00:38:01,896 --> 00:38:02,660
Okay, all right. Let's take a look.

604
00:38:02,780 --> 00:38:04,292
- Are you ready?
- I am ready.

605
00:38:10,102 --> 00:38:12,252
Yeah. Okay. All right.

606
00:38:15,528 --> 00:38:19,289
You and Julia Roberts do bear
a pretty strong resemblance.

607
00:38:19,783 --> 00:38:21,110
I wish that were true.

608
00:38:21,230 --> 00:38:23,792
No, it is true. So we're gonna have
to take away points for difficulty.

609
00:38:23,912 --> 00:38:24,588
Because it was...

610
00:38:26,634 --> 00:38:30,994
So you can see <i>Cupid</i>,
premieres March 31, 10 p.m. on ABC.

611
00:38:31,029 --> 00:38:31,957
Gosh, it was nice meeting you.

612
00:38:32,077 --> 00:38:33,232
- Thank you.
- Thank you so very much.

613
00:38:33,352 --> 00:38:34,775
Ladies and gentlemen, Sarah Paulson.

614
00:38:35,163 --> 00:38:36,903
We'll be right back with Bloc Party.

615
00:38:51,301 --> 00:38:52,871
All right, ladies and gentlemen.

616
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:58,087
Our next guests are an acclaimed
rock 'n' roll band from England.

617
00:38:58,207 --> 00:38:59,887
I'm gonna show you something
here so get ready.

618
00:39:00,007 --> 00:39:02,787
Get ready to take a look at this.
It's their most recent album.

619
00:39:02,822 --> 00:39:04,004
Get ready to take a look at this.

620
00:39:04,124 --> 00:39:04,797
Let's see this thing.

621
00:39:04,917 --> 00:39:06,376
It's called <i>Intimacy</i>. Are you ready?

622
00:39:06,411 --> 00:39:08,184
See this thing. I'd like to see this.
Yeah, I'm ready.

623
00:39:08,597 --> 00:39:10,644
Seriously, if you're not ready,
I'm not gonna...

624
00:39:10,679 --> 00:39:12,861
No, I think we're ready. I'd like to see it.

625
00:39:13,766 --> 00:39:18,489
Oh, wow. Intimate. That's intimacy.

626
00:39:19,320 --> 00:39:19,835
Look at that.

627
00:39:22,831 --> 00:39:24,981
I get the feeling some of you
weren't ready for that.

628
00:39:26,727 --> 00:39:28,971
That's their most recent album, <i>Intimacy</i>.

629
00:39:29,091 --> 00:39:31,332
Please welcome back
to the program Bloc Party.

630
00:43:04,545 --> 00:43:05,839
Yes, sir. Bloc Party.

631
00:43:06,729 --> 00:43:09,065
Thank you gentlemen. Thank you very much.

632
00:43:10,147 --> 00:43:11,825
Good to have you here.
Good to see you again.

633
00:43:12,458 --> 00:43:14,747
It's called <i>Intimacy</i>. There it is.

634
00:43:15,434 --> 00:43:16,589
sThank you for watching.

635
00:43:17,070 --> 00:43:19,288
Craig Ferguson is next.
Good night everybody.
