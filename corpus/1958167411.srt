1
00:00:53,453 --> 00:00:54,254
My whole
life I've been

2
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:55,289
running from something,

3
00:00:55,422 --> 00:00:56,490
I just never really knew

4
00:00:56,624 --> 00:00:57,391
what it was,

5
00:00:57,525 --> 00:00:59,994
until now, it just hit me.

6
00:01:00,160 --> 00:01:01,829
I've been running from myself.

7
00:01:01,963 --> 00:01:02,931
Fuck it, I'm tired of running.

8
00:01:03,063 --> 00:01:03,932
Hey Donald!

9
00:01:05,165 --> 00:01:05,934
Donald!

10
00:01:06,066 --> 00:01:07,001
Oh, shit!

11
00:01:07,134 --> 00:01:08,302
Oh shit, you scared the fuck out

12
00:01:08,435 --> 00:01:09,637
Let's go.

13
00:01:10,437 --> 00:01:11,305
- Hurry up.
- Whose car is this?

14
00:01:11,773 --> 00:01:12,874
It's one of my brothers.

15
00:01:13,007 --> 00:01:14,107
Close the door, let's go.

16
00:01:16,476 --> 00:01:17,411
My granny
always said,

17
00:01:17,545 --> 00:01:19,013
you gotta know where you've been

18
00:01:19,146 --> 00:01:20,048
to know where you're going.

19
00:01:21,448 --> 00:01:22,884
And some things have changed

20
00:01:23,017 --> 00:01:24,052
after the 92 riots,

21
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,252
when South Central separated

22
00:01:25,385 --> 00:01:26,253
from the city of L.A.

23
00:01:26,386 --> 00:01:28,121
to form its own city.

24
00:01:30,758 --> 00:01:31,826
And other things

25
00:01:31,960 --> 00:01:33,360
haven't changed, unfortunately.

26
00:02:32,587 --> 00:02:33,788
Hey!

27
00:02:33,921 --> 00:02:35,155
Hey, bro!

28
00:02:38,258 --> 00:02:39,326
Oh! Hey!

29
00:02:42,130 --> 00:02:43,064
Yeah!

30
00:02:43,196 --> 00:02:44,464
Nigga.

31
00:02:45,133 --> 00:02:46,034
Bro!

32
00:02:46,166 --> 00:02:47,602
My nigga Satin, bro,

33
00:02:47,735 --> 00:02:48,670
what the deal?

34
00:02:51,039 --> 00:02:52,006
My nigga, Snoksie, man,

35
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:53,141
welcome home, bro.

36
00:02:53,273 --> 00:02:54,474
Oh my God, bro!

37
00:02:54,609 --> 00:02:56,077
I appreciate you coming

38
00:02:56,209 --> 00:02:57,145
to bail me out, my nigga,

39
00:02:57,277 --> 00:02:58,445
that's real solid.

40
00:02:58,880 --> 00:03:00,515
I thought I was finna be
in that motherfucker

41
00:03:00,648 --> 00:03:02,382
for a hot minute, my nigga.

42
00:03:03,183 --> 00:03:04,118
I seen some shit in there, bro.

43
00:03:04,284 --> 00:03:05,385
I seen a nigga

44
00:03:05,520 --> 00:03:06,587
put some peanut butter

45
00:03:06,721 --> 00:03:07,722
on a broom stick

46
00:03:07,855 --> 00:03:09,123
and stick it in
a nigga booty, bro.

47
00:03:09,256 --> 00:03:11,391
I was like, "Oh my God!"

48
00:03:11,526 --> 00:03:12,392
Man, what the fuck

49
00:03:12,527 --> 00:03:13,761
is you talking about?

50
00:03:13,895 --> 00:03:15,730
Nigga, peanut butter
and broom sticks

51
00:03:15,863 --> 00:03:17,765
and booty holes, man.

52
00:03:17,899 --> 00:03:19,332
You was in there
for a day and a half.

53
00:03:19,466 --> 00:03:21,135
I'm pretty sure
you ain't make it past

54
00:03:21,268 --> 00:03:22,369
processing, nigga.

55
00:03:23,037 --> 00:03:25,139
That shit ain't cracking
like that, man.

56
00:03:25,472 --> 00:03:27,207
Hey man,

57
00:03:27,675 --> 00:03:29,077
that was real solid of you

58
00:03:29,209 --> 00:03:31,045
bailing me out and shit, bro,

59
00:03:31,244 --> 00:03:33,313
but your breath stank, my nigga.

60
00:03:33,581 --> 00:03:34,816
I can't believe
you talking to me

61
00:03:34,949 --> 00:03:36,249
with your breath
smelling like that.

62
00:03:36,383 --> 00:03:37,618
The last time I had them

63
00:03:37,752 --> 00:03:38,986
I couldn't kiss
my bitch for weeks.

64
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:41,221
You sucking all on
your phalanges and shit.

65
00:03:41,455 --> 00:03:43,223
Hey look bro,

66
00:03:43,356 --> 00:03:44,458
first of all,

67
00:03:44,592 --> 00:03:45,927
you sounding ungrateful

68
00:03:46,060 --> 00:03:47,562
as a motherfucker.

69
00:03:47,762 --> 00:03:49,097
And second,

70
00:03:49,229 --> 00:03:50,164
I don't kiss these hoes

71
00:03:50,297 --> 00:03:51,331
in the mouth, bro.

72
00:03:51,465 --> 00:03:52,399
That give them the impression

73
00:03:52,533 --> 00:03:53,467
that I got feelings for them

74
00:03:53,601 --> 00:03:55,069
or some shit like that, man,

75
00:03:55,203 --> 00:03:57,572
and I'm not trying to mislead

76
00:03:57,705 --> 00:03:59,173
none of these bitches, my nigga.

77
00:03:59,306 --> 00:04:01,709
They got enough problems as is.

78
00:04:01,843 --> 00:04:03,276
And third,

79
00:04:04,411 --> 00:04:05,847
you don't owe me
nothing, my nigga.

80
00:04:05,980 --> 00:04:07,515
- Yeah, bro?
- For now.

81
00:04:07,648 --> 00:04:09,349
But we'll figure all

82
00:04:09,483 --> 00:04:11,219
that shit out later,
my nigga. But...

83
00:04:11,384 --> 00:04:12,954
in the meantime, my nigga,

84
00:04:13,087 --> 00:04:14,254
you think you could, uh...

85
00:04:14,387 --> 00:04:16,323
pull a $20 or something
out your pocket

86
00:04:16,456 --> 00:04:18,159
for a deluxe car wash?

87
00:04:18,291 --> 00:04:20,061
'Cause you got my shit smelling

88
00:04:20,194 --> 00:04:22,262
peanut butter, assholes,

89
00:04:22,395 --> 00:04:23,798
and all the other county jail

90
00:04:23,931 --> 00:04:25,432
flavors, my nigga.

91
00:04:25,566 --> 00:04:26,801
You can't talk with your breathe

92
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,002
smelling like that.

93
00:04:28,136 --> 00:04:30,238
But anyway, start
this motherfucker up.

94
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,471
Get me away from this

95
00:04:31,606 --> 00:04:33,541
systemic oppressionary
peckerwood

96
00:04:33,674 --> 00:04:35,777
persecution bullshit.

97
00:04:35,910 --> 00:04:37,410
Persecution?

98
00:04:37,645 --> 00:04:39,312
Nigga, you the one
who got caught driving

99
00:04:39,446 --> 00:04:40,882
under the influence.

100
00:04:41,749 --> 00:04:43,184
Nigga, I had two beers, bro,

101
00:04:43,316 --> 00:04:45,620
and some Flintstone vitamins
I took with my daughter

102
00:04:45,753 --> 00:04:47,354
to build my amino acids up

103
00:04:47,487 --> 00:04:48,589
to be strong in these
streets, my nigga.

104
00:04:48,723 --> 00:04:50,024
The shit must have, like,

105
00:04:50,158 --> 00:04:52,160
triggered a chemical
imbalance or something.

106
00:04:52,292 --> 00:04:53,360
Anyway,

107
00:04:53,493 --> 00:04:54,427
I'ma get a DA reject.

108
00:04:54,562 --> 00:04:55,495
They looking for real criminals

109
00:04:55,630 --> 00:04:57,265
like your ass, nigga.

110
00:04:57,665 --> 00:04:58,833
You need to take my case

111
00:04:58,966 --> 00:05:01,002
and build your
little rap career up.

112
00:05:01,135 --> 00:05:02,503
A'ight, look,

113
00:05:02,637 --> 00:05:04,071
going to jail ain't
gangster at all, my nigga.

114
00:05:04,205 --> 00:05:06,174
And it definitely ain't
finna to build shit,

115
00:05:06,306 --> 00:05:07,275
you know what I'm saying? But...

116
00:05:07,407 --> 00:05:08,308
nonetheless,

117
00:05:08,441 --> 00:05:09,409
I got your back, my nigga,

118
00:05:09,544 --> 00:05:11,045

119
00:05:11,179 --> 00:05:12,246
I appreciate that, my nigga.

120
00:05:12,513 --> 00:05:14,849
Now start this
bitch up, my nigga.

121
00:05:15,382 --> 00:05:16,617
I need some
vaginal hugs, my nigga.

122
00:05:16,751 --> 00:05:18,318
Vaginal hugs.

123
00:05:18,451 --> 00:05:19,754
Nigga.

124
00:05:21,589 --> 00:05:23,191
Them broom sticks
and that peanut butter

125
00:05:23,323 --> 00:05:24,592
got you lit, huh?

126
00:05:24,725 --> 00:05:26,294
Yeah whatever, fuck.

127
00:05:26,727 --> 00:05:28,229
That's weak.

128
00:05:28,395 --> 00:05:30,565
All right, now slide
down that alley, we good.

129
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:32,533
We been good. To the candy house

130
00:05:32,667 --> 00:05:35,402
We been to the ah-ha.

131
00:05:37,437 --> 00:05:38,371
Yeah,

132
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:40,440
Satin say he got my back,

133
00:05:41,474 --> 00:05:42,844
but who got my front?

134
00:05:44,344 --> 00:05:45,246
A nigga gotta figure out

135
00:05:45,378 --> 00:05:46,147
what's ahead of him

136
00:05:46,280 --> 00:05:47,548
real quick-like.

137
00:07:04,592 --> 00:07:06,127
Oh, morning, mama.

138
00:07:10,898 --> 00:07:13,401
30 years old and
you still sitting in my kitchen

139
00:07:13,534 --> 00:07:15,169
eating Cap 'N Crunch cereal

140
00:07:15,303 --> 00:07:16,570
with your little
wee-wee hanging out.

141
00:07:18,471 --> 00:07:20,374
Boy, some shit don't change.

142
00:07:20,608 --> 00:07:22,276
Mama, that's nasty.

143
00:07:22,410 --> 00:07:23,544
Why you talking about my stuff

144
00:07:23,678 --> 00:07:25,546
like you've seen my thang before

145
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:27,381
I saw it pre-puberty

146
00:07:27,515 --> 00:07:29,150
and let's just say
that's one thing

147
00:07:29,283 --> 00:07:30,918
your daddy didn't gift you with.

148
00:07:31,819 --> 00:07:32,720
Maybe that's why you messing

149
00:07:32,853 --> 00:07:34,622
with them old Mexican girls now.

150
00:07:34,755 --> 00:07:36,590
Your taquito ain't
built for a sister.

151
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:37,658
Here you go.

152
00:07:37,792 --> 00:07:39,427
Mama, I love my sisters,

153
00:07:39,560 --> 00:07:40,661
but I'm just on drama

154
00:07:40,795 --> 00:07:42,129
overload right now.

155
00:07:42,330 --> 00:07:44,231
Because between you
and my baby mama,

156
00:07:44,365 --> 00:07:46,400
y'all bring enough grief
to the table for like

157
00:07:46,534 --> 00:07:48,269
two weekends worth of funerals.

158
00:07:48,436 --> 00:07:50,304
Like, Goddamn,
can I breathe?

159
00:07:50,438 --> 00:07:51,973
Listen Donald,

160
00:07:52,106 --> 00:07:54,408
I've been trying to tell you
this for a long time now.

161
00:07:54,608 --> 00:07:57,578
You need to stand
on your own two feet.

162
00:07:58,379 --> 00:08:00,681
Because your mama ain't
gonna be around much longer

163
00:08:00,815 --> 00:08:02,249
to clean up your shit.

164
00:08:02,383 --> 00:08:04,185
Mama, ain't nothing
finna to happen to you.

165
00:08:04,318 --> 00:08:05,219
Quit playing.

166
00:08:05,353 --> 00:08:06,587
I'm serious, boy.

167
00:08:06,721 --> 00:08:08,756
Now, I'm finna to go to work.

168
00:08:09,190 --> 00:08:09,890
Okay?

169
00:08:10,024 --> 00:08:11,659
You need to straighten up,

170
00:08:11,959 --> 00:08:13,561
get yourself a stable job

171
00:08:13,694 --> 00:08:15,262
and follow suit.

172
00:08:15,396 --> 00:08:17,365
You can't seem to keep a job

173
00:08:17,497 --> 00:08:18,532
or a woman.

174
00:08:18,666 --> 00:08:20,368
Mama, I got a job.

175
00:08:20,501 --> 00:08:21,836
I'm just on suspension right now

176
00:08:21,969 --> 00:08:23,471
Plus I'ma ask Ernie T.

177
00:08:23,604 --> 00:08:24,505
if I could process serve for him

178
00:08:24,638 --> 00:08:25,706
on my beach cruiser.

179
00:08:25,840 --> 00:08:26,774
If not, I'ma just get

180
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:27,842
into the entrepreneur thing.

181
00:08:27,975 --> 00:08:29,477
You know, I - I got...

182
00:08:29,610 --> 00:08:30,711
I got big things popping, mama.

183
00:08:30,845 --> 00:08:32,646
I got apps developing.

184
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,582
You know, niggas love tech shit.

185
00:08:34,715 --> 00:08:35,850
So, why don't you develop

186
00:08:35,983 --> 00:08:38,119

187
00:08:38,652 --> 00:08:39,553
Whatever, ma.

188
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:40,554
They probably already got a app

189
00:08:40,688 --> 00:08:41,956
for that anyway.

190
00:08:42,089 --> 00:08:43,124
Then use it!

191
00:08:44,458 --> 00:08:45,860
Then use that Trade Tech degree

192
00:08:45,993 --> 00:08:48,496
you got hanging up
in the wall in there.

193
00:08:49,630 --> 00:08:50,664
You got way too much

194
00:08:50,798 --> 00:08:52,933
untapped potential, son.

195
00:08:53,434 --> 00:08:54,935
I didn't raise no poop butts.

196
00:08:55,302 --> 00:08:56,771
And your granny,
she didn't come all the way

197
00:08:56,904 --> 00:08:57,872
from Mobile, Alabama

198
00:08:58,005 --> 00:08:59,640
for you to just take up space

199
00:08:59,774 --> 00:09:01,108
in South Central.

200
00:09:01,909 --> 00:09:03,044
We got enough of that

201
00:09:03,177 --> 00:09:04,845
with our young
Black men out here.

202
00:09:21,929 --> 00:09:23,964
Mama, I'ma - I'ma
get the door, mama.

203
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:26,333
'Scuse me.

204
00:09:35,242 --> 00:09:37,244
What's up with it
big homie, Bosco!

205
00:09:37,378 --> 00:09:39,213
What it is, young pimp?

206
00:09:39,346 --> 00:09:40,414
Bosco,

207
00:09:40,549 --> 00:09:41,682
yeah that's my OG.

208
00:09:41,816 --> 00:09:43,417
He a ex-military vet.

209
00:09:43,552 --> 00:09:44,919
He 'bout a decade older than me,

210
00:09:45,052 --> 00:09:46,821
but he was that nigga
that young niggas like me

211
00:09:46,954 --> 00:09:48,322
looked up to in the hood.

212
00:09:48,456 --> 00:09:50,191
He was like the Michael Jordan
of my generation.

213
00:09:50,324 --> 00:09:52,359
Crazy as fuck.

214
00:09:52,493 --> 00:09:53,594
Led the hood in assaults,

215
00:09:53,727 --> 00:09:54,829
batteries, robberies,

216
00:09:54,962 --> 00:09:56,130
and just about every other

217
00:09:56,263 --> 00:09:57,698
criminal stat known
to make a con.

218
00:09:58,866 --> 00:10:00,468
Word is, he used to carry

219
00:10:00,601 --> 00:10:02,103
a briefcase to high school,

220
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:05,840
with a clawed
hammer inside of it,

221
00:10:05,973 --> 00:10:08,577
ready to use it on
any nigga that gave him

222
00:10:08,709 --> 00:10:10,878
or any homie he loved problems.

223
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:14,782
It's ironic that he
eventually became

224
00:10:14,915 --> 00:10:16,585
a carpenter slash handyman.

225
00:10:16,717 --> 00:10:18,819
He is as compassionate
as they come.

226
00:10:18,953 --> 00:10:20,421
But he still has some demons

227
00:10:20,555 --> 00:10:22,156
that he's still dealing with,

228
00:10:22,289 --> 00:10:23,824
and it's said that it stems
from a fucked up incident

229
00:10:23,958 --> 00:10:25,192
during his childhood

230
00:10:25,326 --> 00:10:26,861
or his time in the
Persian Gulf War.

231
00:10:26,994 --> 00:10:29,797
Either way, I got
big love for him.

232
00:10:29,930 --> 00:10:31,600
Some money?

233
00:10:31,732 --> 00:10:33,634
Get that $50 to your mama

234
00:10:33,767 --> 00:10:35,002
and tell her I said thank you.

235
00:10:35,136 --> 00:10:36,538
Oh man, you know
it ain't no thang, bro.

236
00:10:36,670 --> 00:10:37,972
We gotta stick together.

237
00:10:38,105 --> 00:10:39,608
Around here, it ain't
too many of us

238
00:10:39,740 --> 00:10:41,709
left in this neighborhood, man.

239
00:10:41,842 --> 00:10:43,744
The Mexicans done
ran us up outta here.

240
00:10:43,878 --> 00:10:45,746
Nah, we ran ourselves

241
00:10:45,880 --> 00:10:47,882
up outta here, young blood.

242
00:10:48,015 --> 00:10:49,383
Ever since after the riots,

243
00:10:49,518 --> 00:10:51,452
we started giving our shit away.

244
00:10:51,852 --> 00:10:52,887
Always remember,

245
00:10:53,020 --> 00:10:55,222
the strong survive.

246
00:10:55,689 --> 00:10:56,824
But that was real shit, bro.

247
00:10:56,957 --> 00:10:58,259
Real shit though.

248
00:10:58,392 --> 00:11:00,629
But, uh, what's up
with you, though, bro?

249
00:11:00,761 --> 00:11:02,763
Shit, nut.
Nigga had to fuck around

250
00:11:02,897 --> 00:11:03,797
and get his wisdom tooth

251
00:11:03,931 --> 00:11:05,332
pulled with the quickness

252
00:11:05,466 --> 00:11:08,302
and then the county
dropped me from my Medicare.

253
00:11:08,435 --> 00:11:10,639
And check this shit out.
Said 'cause I didn't show up

254
00:11:10,771 --> 00:11:12,806
to my recertification
appointment.

255
00:11:12,940 --> 00:11:13,908
Bullshit.

256
00:11:14,041 --> 00:11:15,843
Hey, 'cause the night before,

257
00:11:15,976 --> 00:11:17,745
I fucked around and got twisted

258
00:11:17,878 --> 00:11:18,979
with Sheila Moe.

259
00:11:19,113 --> 00:11:19,947
Oh! Ooh!

260
00:11:20,080 --> 00:11:21,516
The fuck is you wrappin' now,

261
00:11:21,650 --> 00:11:23,050
Sheila Moe?

262
00:11:23,184 --> 00:11:24,985
Shit, I'ma wrap my
motherfucking lips around this.

263
00:11:25,119 --> 00:11:25,819
Yeah.

264
00:11:25,953 --> 00:11:26,854
Hey, it's better than

265
00:11:26,987 --> 00:11:28,557
that ibuprofen shit they give me

266
00:11:28,689 --> 00:11:29,957
Man, I ain't taking no pills no

267
00:11:30,090 --> 00:11:31,258
You care to partake?
You got a lighter?

268
00:11:31,392 --> 00:11:32,661
Hell yeah.

269
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:34,028
So far. Let me see.

270
00:11:34,161 --> 00:11:35,496
You know it work.

271
00:11:35,630 --> 00:11:36,497
The OG smoke OG.

272
00:11:36,631 --> 00:11:37,898
Let's get it on, nigga.

273
00:11:38,032 --> 00:11:38,966
Hey, you hear that?

274
00:11:39,099 --> 00:11:40,234
Is it trash day today?

275
00:11:40,367 --> 00:11:41,068
Hell nah.

276
00:11:43,804 --> 00:11:44,705
Oh shit! Hey!

277
00:11:44,838 --> 00:11:46,006
That's the repo man.

278
00:11:46,140 --> 00:11:46,774
Goddamn!

279
00:11:48,142 --> 00:11:50,579
Hey!
Man, fuck! Hey!

280
00:11:50,711 --> 00:11:51,546
Shit!

281
00:11:52,547 --> 00:11:54,549
Fuck! I just got
that motherfucker

282
00:11:54,683 --> 00:11:55,916
out the impound.

283
00:11:56,685 --> 00:11:57,918
Damn!

284
00:11:59,753 --> 00:12:00,988
Fuck that car note, though, man.

285
00:12:01,121 --> 00:12:03,090
I'm tired of that shit.

286
00:12:03,824 --> 00:12:04,925
Damn, bro!

287
00:12:05,059 --> 00:12:05,826
They got yo ass.

288
00:12:05,960 --> 00:12:06,827
Oh my God!

289
00:12:06,961 --> 00:12:08,729
This bitch, bro.

290
00:12:09,063 --> 00:12:11,600
Really gonna need this
motherfucker after this.

291
00:12:12,967 --> 00:12:14,235
Here, nigga.

292
00:12:14,368 --> 00:12:16,437
Since you can't seem to
pay me no child support,

293
00:12:16,571 --> 00:12:18,272
the least you could do is
spend some more time

294
00:12:18,405 --> 00:12:19,173
with your daughter.

295
00:12:19,306 --> 00:12:20,474
Tasha, what, you can't be just

296
00:12:20,609 --> 00:12:21,742
popping up at my mama house

297
00:12:21,875 --> 00:12:23,678
on this ghetto shit.
It's not cool.

298
00:12:23,811 --> 00:12:24,679
And you can't just be ducking

299
00:12:24,812 --> 00:12:26,013
your responsibility.

300
00:12:26,146 --> 00:12:27,314
There ain't nobody
ducking nothing.

301
00:12:27,448 --> 00:12:28,782
I stay with my
daughter all the time.

302
00:12:28,916 --> 00:12:30,818
Well, all the time ain't enough.

303
00:12:30,951 --> 00:12:32,186
And you better not have her

304
00:12:32,319 --> 00:12:33,588
around that Mexican hoe,
I promise you.

305
00:12:33,722 --> 00:12:34,589
Oh my God!

306
00:12:34,723 --> 00:12:36,023
Daddy, what's a hoe?

307
00:12:37,191 --> 00:12:38,092
Ask your mama, baby.

308
00:12:38,225 --> 00:12:39,594
I'm sure she can show you

309
00:12:39,728 --> 00:12:41,295
a good example of one.

310
00:12:41,428 --> 00:12:42,763
And I ain't feeling
that gangsta ass

311
00:12:42,896 --> 00:12:43,764
nigga Mike-Mike around

312
00:12:43,897 --> 00:12:45,132
my daughter either.

313
00:12:46,233 --> 00:12:47,968
Baby, go in the house
and watch some cartoons,

314
00:12:48,102 --> 00:12:49,803
daddy will be in
there in a minute.

315
00:12:51,005 --> 00:12:53,407
Tasha, look we don't gotta fuck

316
00:12:53,541 --> 00:12:55,242
with each other.
I don't gotta like you,

317
00:12:55,376 --> 00:12:57,378
you don't gotta like me,
but we gotta respect each other.

318
00:12:57,512 --> 00:12:59,748
All this poppin' up at my
mama house unannounced shit,

319
00:12:59,880 --> 00:13:01,482
this some ratchet ghetto shit.

320
00:13:01,616 --> 00:13:02,584
I can't fuck with this shit,

321
00:13:02,717 --> 00:13:03,551
- for real.
- Ratchet?

322
00:13:03,685 --> 00:13:04,918
Nigga, fuck you, okay.

323
00:13:05,052 --> 00:13:06,755
Fuck you and
that little ass-dick.

324
00:13:06,887 --> 00:13:08,523
Fuck yo mama.

325
00:13:08,657 --> 00:13:10,124
How 'bout you fuck your mama
with that little ass-dick,

326
00:13:10,257 --> 00:13:11,726
- Broke-ass nigga.
- You see...

327
00:13:11,859 --> 00:13:13,561
- ... this bitch is just ratchet.
- What you say you,

328
00:13:13,695 --> 00:13:15,664
- you heifer? What you say?
- Mama!

329
00:13:15,796 --> 00:13:17,197
- Bye, mama.
- Mama.

330
00:13:17,331 --> 00:13:18,899
- Yo, Oh, God.
- Put me down. Put me down!

331
00:13:19,033 --> 00:13:19,967
This is shit all...

332
00:13:20,100 --> 00:13:21,135
Mama, your granddaughter looking

333
00:13:21,268 --> 00:13:22,504
You can't just be out here

334
00:13:22,637 --> 00:13:23,837
chippin' with her.

335
00:13:23,971 --> 00:13:25,540
This is what I'll
be talking about.

336
00:13:25,674 --> 00:13:26,641
Damn!

337
00:13:26,775 --> 00:13:27,676
Put some clothes on, knucklehead

338
00:13:27,808 --> 00:13:29,076
Oh my God!

339
00:13:41,556 --> 00:13:44,793
So, how's that golf stroke
doing, Mayor Taylor?

340
00:13:44,925 --> 00:13:45,893
'Bout as good as that pen stroke

341
00:13:46,026 --> 00:13:47,061
of yours is doing.

342
00:13:47,194 --> 00:13:48,128
I guess you forgot how much

343
00:13:48,262 --> 00:13:49,564
I used to whoop you up and down

344
00:13:49,698 --> 00:13:50,931
that golf course, my friend.

345
00:13:51,065 --> 00:13:53,133
I think your memory
fails you, buddy.

346
00:13:53,267 --> 00:13:54,736
Now ,how are you
supposed to run a city

347
00:13:54,868 --> 00:13:55,804
with so much potential

348
00:13:55,936 --> 00:13:57,071
like South Central

349
00:13:57,204 --> 00:13:58,105
when you can't even remember

350
00:13:58,238 --> 00:13:59,541
the last beating you took.

351
00:13:59,674 --> 00:14:00,974
The last beating I took

352
00:14:01,108 --> 00:14:02,476
was from my mother
in the fifth grade

353
00:14:02,610 --> 00:14:05,379
when I came home
after the street lights came on.

354
00:14:05,513 --> 00:14:06,781
Best believe that's
the last hell

355
00:14:06,914 --> 00:14:08,449
I ever took.

356
00:14:08,583 --> 00:14:10,184
Yeah, well, let's hope
that mythological winning streak

357
00:14:10,317 --> 00:14:12,086
of yours is unwavering

358
00:14:12,219 --> 00:14:13,755
for your upcoming
reelection campaign.

359
00:14:13,887 --> 00:14:16,457
Hey, you just make sure you
have that doggone check ready.

360
00:14:17,726 --> 00:14:18,626
Hey, what's wrong with you?

361
00:14:18,760 --> 00:14:19,661
Why you keep, uh, rubbing

362
00:14:19,794 --> 00:14:20,894
at your chest like that?

363
00:14:21,028 --> 00:14:22,162
Oh, I, uh,
I fucked up and left

364
00:14:22,296 --> 00:14:23,964
my
body wash at home.

365
00:14:24,098 --> 00:14:26,900
Had to use
that damn cheap-ass hotel soap.

366
00:14:27,034 --> 00:14:28,670
And normally I wouldn't
wash my dog

367
00:14:28,803 --> 00:14:29,937
with that brick shit,

368
00:14:30,070 --> 00:14:31,105
but I couldn't show
up to a meeting

369
00:14:31,238 --> 00:14:32,807
with a big time mayor

370
00:14:32,940 --> 00:14:34,441
such as yourself smelling like
- Oh, whatever.

371
00:14:34,576 --> 00:14:36,477
the uh lost and found
box at the Y, right?

372
00:14:42,851 --> 00:14:44,151
Damn.

373
00:14:47,789 --> 00:14:48,723
What the fuck do you think

374
00:14:48,857 --> 00:14:49,990
they're over there talking about

375
00:14:50,124 --> 00:14:51,358
I don't know.

376
00:14:52,359 --> 00:14:53,927
You know, politicians are just

377
00:14:54,061 --> 00:14:56,130
professional fertilizer spreader

378
00:14:56,263 --> 00:14:57,732
Some people spread more shit

379
00:14:57,866 --> 00:14:59,266
on their lawn than others.

380
00:15:00,267 --> 00:15:02,202
The fuck do we care?

381
00:15:02,469 --> 00:15:03,370
True, true.

382
00:15:04,806 --> 00:15:06,473
The man wants us
to observe and report,

383
00:15:06,608 --> 00:15:07,975
so I'm gonna sit
here and observe

384
00:15:08,108 --> 00:15:10,779
and report for
a few extra duckets.

385
00:15:11,145 --> 00:15:12,980
Shit, God knows I need 'em.

386
00:15:14,081 --> 00:15:15,249
You know, our priority

387
00:15:15,382 --> 00:15:17,418
is to chase dope and guns,

388
00:15:17,552 --> 00:15:19,219
not some entitled
elitist asshole

389
00:15:19,353 --> 00:15:21,422
who likes waving his dick around

390
00:15:21,556 --> 00:15:24,258
like a 10 inch dick
on a porn set.

391
00:15:26,594 --> 00:15:27,529
But like porn,

392
00:15:27,662 --> 00:15:29,229
this pays very well,

393
00:15:29,363 --> 00:15:31,800
it just doesn't include
any high level of dignity

394
00:15:31,932 --> 00:15:32,901
once the job is done.

395
00:15:34,468 --> 00:15:39,473
But we go on
and get that money shot, dawg.

396
00:15:39,607 --> 00:15:40,842
You know, you have
a very dirty way

397
00:15:40,974 --> 00:15:42,042
of expressing yourself.

398
00:15:42,176 --> 00:15:43,745
And a very dirty habit.

399
00:15:43,878 --> 00:15:47,047
Those things are gonna kill me,
if they don't kill you first.

400
00:15:47,181 --> 00:15:48,482
Oh, well, hopefully
they will before

401
00:15:48,616 --> 00:15:50,484
some South Central
gang member does.

402
00:15:54,388 --> 00:15:56,056
I guess you got a point there.

403
00:15:57,859 --> 00:16:02,664
There's more honor in dying
from tobacco fire than gun fire.

404
00:16:02,797 --> 00:16:04,398
You've enlightened me.

405
00:16:05,032 --> 00:16:06,701
Let's get the fuck out of here.

406
00:16:08,870 --> 00:16:10,237
Bust some heads.

407
00:16:31,391 --> 00:16:33,293
You're sure the council
will approve this?

408
00:16:33,427 --> 00:16:35,329
You got the money.
I got the land.

409
00:16:35,730 --> 00:16:37,064
Three out of five of
the city council seats

410
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:38,232
are my people

411
00:16:38,365 --> 00:16:39,634
and majority vote rules,

412
00:16:39,767 --> 00:16:42,002
which means your
property development

413
00:16:42,135 --> 00:16:43,605
is in good hands.

414
00:16:43,738 --> 00:16:46,641
Well, when we break ground,
we break bread, brother.

415
00:16:46,774 --> 00:16:50,310
Let's just be ready
to cut that check, colonizer.

416
00:16:50,444 --> 00:16:52,045
I travel with cash, my friend.

417
00:16:52,179 --> 00:16:53,347
Okay.

418
00:16:53,480 --> 00:16:54,749
Oh, hey,

419
00:16:54,883 --> 00:16:56,851
what's the status
on that dispensary?

420
00:16:56,985 --> 00:16:58,385
Yo, word from PD is

421
00:16:58,520 --> 00:16:59,854
they've had trouble maintaining
the added paperwork

422
00:16:59,988 --> 00:17:01,388
to stay in business,
so doesn't look like

423
00:17:01,523 --> 00:17:03,156
they're gonna be
around much longer.

424
00:17:03,290 --> 00:17:05,359
There's also rumors of
possible illegal activity

425
00:17:05,492 --> 00:17:07,261
running through that place.
So, if I were you,

426
00:17:07,394 --> 00:17:08,863
I'd be prepared
to take possession

427
00:17:08,997 --> 00:17:10,130
of that property as well.

428
00:17:10,264 --> 00:17:12,165
All right.

429
00:17:15,035 --> 00:17:15,870
Hello, pussy.

430
00:17:17,739 --> 00:17:21,009
What do you call a man
who kills and steals

431
00:17:21,141 --> 00:17:22,844
from his own people?

432
00:17:25,212 --> 00:17:26,681
Normally, I'd call
him an ambulance,

433
00:17:26,814 --> 00:17:29,349
but in your case,
I call him a traitor.

434
00:17:33,153 --> 00:17:34,589
Ooh!

435
00:17:34,722 --> 00:17:36,591
Your Black ass ain't worth
the ride to the hospital.

436
00:17:39,027 --> 00:17:41,061
Yo punk-ass has committed

437
00:17:41,194 --> 00:17:43,765
the most egregious
and heinous act

438
00:17:43,898 --> 00:17:46,834
a motherfucker could
possibly pull off.

439
00:17:47,167 --> 00:17:48,168
Mm-hmm.

440
00:17:48,302 --> 00:17:49,671
You hear me, motherfucker?

441
00:17:50,505 --> 00:17:52,372
You like molesting
our Black baby girls,

442
00:17:52,507 --> 00:17:54,374
don't you, Dirty Donnie?

443
00:17:54,509 --> 00:17:55,543
Yeah.

444
00:17:56,945 --> 00:18:01,081
You have robbed
the future curator of Black life

445
00:18:01,214 --> 00:18:02,850
of her innocence.

446
00:18:02,984 --> 00:18:06,054
So, from this day forward,
I'm going to impose

447
00:18:06,219 --> 00:18:08,723
a no registered
sex offender policy

448
00:18:08,856 --> 00:18:13,027
for the city of South Central,
starting with you.

449
00:18:13,160 --> 00:18:14,094
Mm-hmm.

450
00:18:17,497 --> 00:18:18,800
You better take that old
fruity tooty bullshit

451
00:18:18,933 --> 00:18:21,234
back out there to
Riverside or some shit.

452
00:18:22,804 --> 00:18:25,305
Oh, yeah,
but that ain't all, pussy.

453
00:18:25,439 --> 00:18:27,075
Oh, yeah, and since
the police don't know

454
00:18:27,207 --> 00:18:29,077
about your latest victim,

455
00:18:30,344 --> 00:18:31,913
we're gonna assure that you

456
00:18:32,046 --> 00:18:36,017
never so much as get aroused
at reminiscing on the thought

457
00:18:36,149 --> 00:18:38,052
of your past indiscretions.

458
00:18:38,218 --> 00:18:39,654
Oh, yeah, we're
going to eliminate

459
00:18:39,787 --> 00:18:42,356
that possibility. Uh-huh.

460
00:18:42,489 --> 00:18:45,225
Unless, of course,
you wanna go back to prison.

461
00:18:45,359 --> 00:18:47,194
You want that? Oh, yeah,

462
00:18:47,327 --> 00:18:48,930
I'm sure we can
arrange that shit.

463
00:18:49,063 --> 00:18:50,064
Mm-hmm.

464
00:18:50,197 --> 00:18:51,666
We can arrange that for you.

465
00:18:51,799 --> 00:18:54,102
Oh, but you know what,
that's a parole violation

466
00:18:54,234 --> 00:18:57,337
and you are a repeat offender.

467
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,374
You know what?

468
00:19:00,508 --> 00:19:02,242
I bet you wouldn't
live past booking

469
00:19:02,376 --> 00:19:04,078
once your jacket hit the wire.

470
00:19:04,211 --> 00:19:06,413
Oh, yeah. Even the
guards at Wasco

471
00:19:06,814 --> 00:19:10,384
would turn a blind eye
to a medieval molly-whopping

472
00:19:10,518 --> 00:19:12,620
on a serial child molester.

473
00:19:13,420 --> 00:19:14,421
Oh, yeah.

474
00:19:17,424 --> 00:19:18,626
Hey, yo, Pipe!

475
00:19:46,587 --> 00:19:48,255
You ready to operate?

476
00:19:48,756 --> 00:19:49,791
Operate?

477
00:19:50,558 --> 00:19:52,160
I wouldn't call a quick,

478
00:19:54,095 --> 00:19:55,328
across the neck an operation.

479
00:19:56,064 --> 00:19:58,265
No. You 'bout to cut
this niggas nuts off.

480
00:20:00,568 --> 00:20:02,937
I'm not touching
a niggas dick, man.

481
00:20:03,071 --> 00:20:04,371
Under no circumstances

482
00:20:04,505 --> 00:20:06,206
or circumcisions.

483
00:20:06,339 --> 00:20:07,742
Well, look, well go get
some tongs or something.

484
00:20:07,875 --> 00:20:09,944
I won't look at you any
differently, my brother.

485
00:20:10,078 --> 00:20:11,179
I promise.

486
00:20:11,311 --> 00:20:12,446
Look at...

487
00:20:12,580 --> 00:20:14,314
You ain't said
nothing about this.

488
00:20:16,150 --> 00:20:18,052
This some primal

489
00:20:18,186 --> 00:20:19,453
cock-a-zulu shit.

490
00:20:19,587 --> 00:20:22,123
Hey man look,
killing this diseased sicko

491
00:20:22,255 --> 00:20:23,658
is too easy.

492
00:20:24,458 --> 00:20:25,727
Come on, bruh.

493
00:20:27,595 --> 00:20:29,262
Do it for the culture.

494
00:20:32,100 --> 00:20:33,433
Slicing nuts

495
00:20:34,234 --> 00:20:35,570
for the culture, huh?

496
00:20:36,671 --> 00:20:37,471
It...

497
00:20:40,208 --> 00:20:41,341
Fuck it.

498
00:20:44,478 --> 00:20:46,346
Boy,

499
00:20:46,480 --> 00:20:48,248
you gonna wish you
was dead after this.

500
00:20:48,381 --> 00:20:50,250
Oh, yeah. Mm-hmm.

501
00:20:50,383 --> 00:20:51,853
Hey, hey, yo Pipe!

502
00:20:51,986 --> 00:20:54,088
Hey, bring some towels
and uh, a pickle jar

503
00:20:54,222 --> 00:20:55,322
for this nigga's gonads.

504
00:20:55,455 --> 00:20:57,357
Oh yeah.

505
00:20:57,491 --> 00:20:59,359
Ain't no mo' bumping
and grinding

506
00:20:59,493 --> 00:21:01,662
on our babies for you, shithead.

507
00:21:02,630 --> 00:21:04,364
But you know what,

508
00:21:04,498 --> 00:21:05,600
I'ma give you a chance

509
00:21:05,733 --> 00:21:07,902
to apologize to the community

510
00:21:08,035 --> 00:21:10,037
that you betrayed
with your sadistic

511
00:21:10,171 --> 00:21:12,840
and predatory actions.

512
00:21:12,974 --> 00:21:14,742
Go ahead, let me hear it.
Go.

513
00:21:14,876 --> 00:21:16,043
I'm sorry!

514
00:21:16,177 --> 00:21:17,111
Mm-hmm.

515
00:21:17,245 --> 00:21:18,679
I'm sorry!

516
00:21:20,413 --> 00:21:22,216
I'm s...
I'm sorry like a motherfucker.

517
00:21:22,349 --> 00:21:23,684
I am so sorry.

518
00:21:23,818 --> 00:21:25,520
Look, let me go.
I'll be on the first thing

519
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:27,188
smoking back to the IE.

520
00:21:27,320 --> 00:21:28,689
You will never see me.

521
00:21:28,823 --> 00:21:31,058
I swear to God, you don't
treat people like this!

522
00:21:31,192 --> 00:21:33,360
It ain't gotta be this way.

523
00:21:34,128 --> 00:21:35,830
It ain't gotta be this way.

524
00:21:36,496 --> 00:21:38,032
It don't.

525
00:21:38,166 --> 00:21:40,500
It don't gotta be like this.

526
00:21:42,537 --> 00:21:43,436
Yes, it does.

527
00:21:45,807 --> 00:21:46,808
Oh, yeah.

528
00:21:47,942 --> 00:21:50,645
You made our
babies suffer in silence.

529
00:21:52,013 --> 00:21:54,549
I'm gonna hear
you suffer out loud.

530
00:21:59,587 --> 00:22:01,622
May I suggest some Witch Hazel

531
00:22:02,657 --> 00:22:05,259
and some Cocoa Butter
for your wound.

532
00:22:13,366 --> 00:22:14,635
Sundown!

533
00:22:14,769 --> 00:22:15,468
No, no!

534
00:22:15,603 --> 00:22:16,971
Sundown look,

535
00:22:17,104 --> 00:22:18,940
I used to ride bikes up
and down the street

536
00:22:19,073 --> 00:22:21,609
with your nephew Terry, yeah?

537
00:22:21,809 --> 00:22:23,211
You gonna have to
pull his drawers down.

538
00:22:23,343 --> 00:22:24,846
Shit, ain't nothing but a thing.

539
00:22:24,979 --> 00:22:26,113
No!

540
00:22:26,247 --> 00:22:27,215
Hold him down
so he pushed forward.

541
00:22:27,347 --> 00:22:28,115
No!

542
00:22:28,249 --> 00:22:29,482
No!

543
00:22:29,617 --> 00:22:33,120
No!

544
00:22:51,438 --> 00:22:52,740
I thought I smelt churizo.

545
00:22:52,874 --> 00:22:54,342
Yeah, you know,
maybe I do smell like

546
00:22:54,474 --> 00:22:56,611
your mother's pussy,
being that I'm only 30 minutes

547
00:22:56,744 --> 00:22:58,279
out of it, without so
much as a hoe bath.

548
00:22:58,411 --> 00:23:01,616
You got a towel for Big Jim
and the twins, by the way?

549
00:23:01,749 --> 00:23:03,651
Come on, it's penance time,
puto.

550
00:23:04,819 --> 00:23:06,254
She wants her reparations.

551
00:23:06,419 --> 00:23:07,822
And me, I want...

552
00:23:07,955 --> 00:23:10,224
I want a little quid pro quo
for keeping the G-men

553
00:23:10,358 --> 00:23:11,325
off your ass, Spanky.

554
00:23:11,458 --> 00:23:12,627
You know, the Feds,

555
00:23:12,760 --> 00:23:14,729
they're not as
diplomatic as we are.

556
00:23:15,428 --> 00:23:16,831
You know, if I could only

557
00:23:16,964 --> 00:23:18,398
get my girlfriend to fuck me
as much as you two do.

558
00:23:18,532 --> 00:23:19,600
Nigga, weren't you listening?

559
00:23:19,734 --> 00:23:21,669
He just told you,
she's fatigued

560
00:23:21,802 --> 00:23:23,403
from taking all that

561
00:23:23,537 --> 00:23:26,641
big fat white schlong
in her mouth.

562
00:23:26,774 --> 00:23:28,643
Ain't that right, Artful Dodger?

563
00:23:28,776 --> 00:23:30,144
- Yeah.
- Fuck you, salt

564
00:23:30,278 --> 00:23:32,046
- And Pepper.
- No bitch, fuck you.

565
00:23:32,346 --> 00:23:35,116
And you can eat my fat-ass
clit while you at it,

566
00:23:35,249 --> 00:23:37,151
instead of all them damn
carno asado tacos

567
00:23:37,285 --> 00:23:39,553
you be shoving in
your fat-ass mouth.

568
00:23:39,687 --> 00:23:41,289
Miss me with this blah, blah.

569
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,724
Run and get my care package now.

570
00:23:44,592 --> 00:23:46,827
Andale, bitch.

571
00:23:47,194 --> 00:23:49,730
They only run fast when
they're crossing the border.

572
00:23:49,864 --> 00:23:52,300
Make like you're on the
Tijuana track team, Spanky.

573
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:55,369
Come on,
get my care package.

574
00:23:55,503 --> 00:23:56,938
Arriba!

575
00:24:05,846 --> 00:24:07,915
Fucking sick.

576
00:24:08,049 --> 00:24:09,517
Hoe ass nigga.

577
00:24:09,650 --> 00:24:11,352
Babies delivered.

578
00:24:11,484 --> 00:24:12,485
Shit!

579
00:24:12,620 --> 00:24:14,487
How many babies? Quadruplets?

580
00:24:14,622 --> 00:24:16,524
Fucking twins.

581
00:24:16,657 --> 00:24:18,626
You're short. What's up?

582
00:24:19,093 --> 00:24:20,795
They just cleaned me out.
Y'all were late.

583
00:24:20,928 --> 00:24:23,030
Should have been
out here on CP time.

584
00:24:23,731 --> 00:24:25,299
You're delinquent
on this, Spanky.

585
00:24:25,433 --> 00:24:26,466
When are we getting more?

586
00:24:28,269 --> 00:24:29,570
I'll know in about
a month or so.

587
00:24:29,704 --> 00:24:31,238
Fuck a month or so.

588
00:24:31,372 --> 00:24:33,374
We need more now, so you
get your fat ass on the phone,

589
00:24:33,507 --> 00:24:34,775
you call El Chapo

590
00:24:34,909 --> 00:24:36,677
and you get him to
give me my shit now,

591
00:24:36,811 --> 00:24:38,079
- Nigga.
- Yeah, well,

592
00:24:38,212 --> 00:24:39,347
it don't work like
that, right, homes.

593
00:24:39,479 --> 00:24:40,748
Why the fuck it work.

594
00:24:40,881 --> 00:24:41,682
You know, maybe it
would work that way

595
00:24:41,816 --> 00:24:42,750
if La Migra came in here

596
00:24:42,883 --> 00:24:44,151
and shut this motherfucker down

597
00:24:44,285 --> 00:24:46,187
and hooked up all
the swim team rejects

598
00:24:46,320 --> 00:24:47,254
you got working here.

599
00:24:47,388 --> 00:24:48,723
Then it would work, wouldn't it?

600
00:24:48,856 --> 00:24:50,124
Well, it wouldn't make
a fucking difference.

601
00:24:50,257 --> 00:24:52,093
So, you two piglets
can throw the spot.

602
00:24:52,226 --> 00:24:53,561
'Cause you ain't getting
nothing else today.

603
00:24:53,694 --> 00:24:54,962
A'ight?

604
00:24:55,730 --> 00:24:56,831
Fuck yo fat ass.

605
00:25:00,901 --> 00:25:01,869
Come on, Chris, go.

606
00:25:02,003 --> 00:25:03,404
Come on.

607
00:25:03,537 --> 00:25:04,905
We got bigger fish to fry.

608
00:25:08,709 --> 00:25:09,977
Damn!

609
00:25:10,111 --> 00:25:11,612
And bring me back
the rest now but then

610
00:25:11,746 --> 00:25:13,514
when you come back
next time, home girl.

611
00:25:13,647 --> 00:25:14,548
Fuck your fat ass.

612
00:25:14,682 --> 00:25:15,983
Yeah, fuck you too.

613
00:25:16,117 --> 00:25:18,452
The last thing you need
is some fucking food.

614
00:25:18,586 --> 00:25:20,054
What, bitch?

615
00:25:20,488 --> 00:25:21,355
Not today.

616
00:25:21,489 --> 00:25:23,124
Check yo little bitch!

617
00:25:30,631 --> 00:25:32,400
Customers of yours?

618
00:25:32,666 --> 00:25:33,968
Something like that.

619
00:25:34,702 --> 00:25:36,370
Anyway, you got that
package ready for me

620
00:25:36,505 --> 00:25:37,838
so I can make that run for you?

621
00:25:37,972 --> 00:25:39,840
Ain't gonna be no run.

622
00:25:40,107 --> 00:25:41,275
Why?

623
00:25:41,409 --> 00:25:42,877
'Cause I ain't got a
fucking package, a'ight?

624
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:46,680
Hey, you don't gotta be
an asshole, asshole.

625
00:25:46,814 --> 00:25:49,183
Yeah.

626
00:25:58,726 --> 00:26:00,461
Jackie! Spanky!
Come get your eggs.

627
00:26:08,769 --> 00:26:10,471
Hey, where's your brother?

628
00:26:10,771 --> 00:26:13,441
I don't know.
I ain't my brother's keeper.

629
00:26:13,908 --> 00:26:15,209
I got my own things
to worry about.

630
00:26:15,342 --> 00:26:17,111
Mhm. Well,

631
00:26:17,244 --> 00:26:20,681
why don't you worry about eating
since you are eating for two.

632
00:26:20,815 --> 00:26:21,615
Come on, baby.

633
00:26:21,749 --> 00:26:22,950
Sit down. Eat your eggs.

634
00:26:25,820 --> 00:26:27,088
There.

635
00:26:27,588 --> 00:26:31,892
Okay.

636
00:26:32,026 --> 00:26:34,195
Yaya, I don't know why
you worry about us so much.

637
00:26:34,328 --> 00:26:36,297
You should be
worried about yourself.

638
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:37,665
I mean, you gotta focus on you

639
00:26:37,798 --> 00:26:39,633
now with papa not
being here no more.

640
00:26:39,767 --> 00:26:42,603
You gotta be more
selfish for once.

641
00:26:42,736 --> 00:26:44,872
Well you know,
I guess it's in our blood.

642
00:26:45,039 --> 00:26:46,907
Latina women take
care of their own

643
00:26:47,274 --> 00:26:48,943
and you're gonna
have to do that too.

644
00:26:49,076 --> 00:26:51,212
Even until the grave.

645
00:26:53,314 --> 00:26:55,550
And even take care of
that boyfriend of yours,

646
00:26:55,683 --> 00:26:57,384
even if he is a Black one.

647
00:26:57,519 --> 00:26:59,019
Yaya!

648
00:26:59,153 --> 00:27:00,888
Look, love it or hate it,
you're gonna have to accept it,

649
00:27:01,021 --> 00:27:02,356
because he ain't going nowhere.

650
00:27:02,490 --> 00:27:03,691
Baby, please.

651
00:27:03,824 --> 00:27:05,860
You're a baby mama in training.
Okay?

652
00:27:05,993 --> 00:27:07,795
They always leave
their women and kids.

653
00:27:07,928 --> 00:27:10,631
Whatever.

654
00:27:11,499 --> 00:27:13,134
Okay, not always, but a lot.

655
00:27:15,336 --> 00:27:17,572
You know, don't come at me,
because of my situation,

656
00:27:17,705 --> 00:27:19,508
when you are by
yourself right now.

657
00:27:20,474 --> 00:27:23,477
Look at...
You just need a distraction.

658
00:27:25,779 --> 00:27:27,848
Mijo, come, sit down.
Eat your eggs.

659
00:27:27,982 --> 00:27:29,618
You know I ain't got no
time for no eggs.

660
00:27:29,750 --> 00:27:31,218
What's wrong with you?

661
00:27:31,352 --> 00:27:32,786
You always used to eat my
eggs when you were a kid.

662
00:27:32,920 --> 00:27:33,954
And ask for seconds and
even thirds sometimes.

663
00:27:34,088 --> 00:27:34,788
Mm-hmm.

664
00:27:34,922 --> 00:27:36,625
I got business to handle.

665
00:27:36,824 --> 00:27:38,425
Well, what kind of business?

666
00:27:38,560 --> 00:27:40,060
Come here, let me talk to you.

667
00:27:42,963 --> 00:27:44,533
Hey, so you got some blow?

668
00:27:44,665 --> 00:27:45,666
No, I ain't got nothing for you.

669
00:27:45,799 --> 00:27:47,067
Bullshit!

670
00:27:47,201 --> 00:27:49,504
Come on now,
I know you have something

671
00:27:49,638 --> 00:27:50,804
for your mother.

672
00:27:50,938 --> 00:27:51,739
I see all that stuff
you're pushing.

673
00:27:51,872 --> 00:27:53,040
I'm not stupid.

674
00:27:53,174 --> 00:27:54,108
Hey, hey, hey,
chill out, all right.

675
00:27:54,241 --> 00:27:55,342
I told you I ain't got nothing.

676
00:27:55,476 --> 00:27:56,677
That's my word, all right.

677
00:27:57,044 --> 00:27:58,479
If you don't give it to me,

678
00:27:58,613 --> 00:28:00,649
you know I'm gonna go
find it from somewhere else.

679
00:28:00,781 --> 00:28:01,949
Huh, maybe I'll have Jackie's

680
00:28:02,082 --> 00:28:03,951
mayate boyfriend
hook me up, hmm?

681
00:28:04,952 --> 00:28:06,754
All right. Fuck it then.

682
00:28:06,887 --> 00:28:08,022
Yeah. I thought so.

683
00:28:08,155 --> 00:28:09,524
Respect your mom.

684
00:28:14,862 --> 00:28:16,397
You eating eggs, baby?

685
00:28:16,531 --> 00:28:17,798
Yeah, ma.

686
00:28:49,830 --> 00:28:51,031
I guess paying all the bills

687
00:28:51,165 --> 00:28:52,299
around here ain't
good enough, huh?

688
00:28:53,133 --> 00:28:55,035
Don't blow it all in one day.

689
00:28:55,970 --> 00:28:57,338
I'm out. Later, Jackie.

690
00:28:58,607 --> 00:29:00,274
Hi.

691
00:29:19,628 --> 00:29:22,530
Fuck this nigga at?

692
00:29:23,130 --> 00:29:25,766
You ever meet a punctual
dope dealer before?

693
00:29:25,899 --> 00:29:27,801
No. Just that got me fucked up.

694
00:29:27,935 --> 00:29:29,103
Got us sitting here
looking all hot

695
00:29:29,236 --> 00:29:31,005
with two kilos
of coke in the trunk.

696
00:29:31,138 --> 00:29:32,106
Calm down, cowgirl.

697
00:29:32,239 --> 00:29:33,575
What do we gotta be afraid of?

698
00:29:33,708 --> 00:29:34,808
Huh?

699
00:29:34,942 --> 00:29:36,443
We're motherfucking Johnny Law,

700
00:29:36,578 --> 00:29:39,913
SID, Special
Investigations Division.

701
00:29:41,982 --> 00:29:43,652
Yeah, you right.

702
00:29:43,784 --> 00:29:45,019
I'm the motherfuckin man, now.

703
00:29:47,221 --> 00:29:49,923
I just didn't never done
no shit like this before.

704
00:29:50,491 --> 00:29:53,961
And you know it's for my
mama's kidney transplant, stat.

705
00:29:55,262 --> 00:29:57,031
You know how much it costs
to move a black market

706
00:29:57,164 --> 00:29:59,266
kidney in from the Philippines?

707
00:29:59,701 --> 00:30:00,702
How much?

708
00:30:00,834 --> 00:30:02,369
Quarter of a mil.

709
00:30:02,737 --> 00:30:04,405
$250,000?

710
00:30:07,241 --> 00:30:08,242
Well,

711
00:30:09,143 --> 00:30:12,079
we better start working
a whole lot of overtime quick.

712
00:30:12,681 --> 00:30:14,783
Yeah, well, where the fuck
are we gonna find more product?

713
00:30:14,915 --> 00:30:16,584
Big Paul said he ran out.

714
00:30:16,718 --> 00:30:17,951
I can find it.

715
00:30:19,086 --> 00:30:20,588
I'm itching for
that early retirement.

716
00:30:20,722 --> 00:30:22,791
I've been doing this
for 28 fucking years

717
00:30:22,923 --> 00:30:25,059
and I'm ready to
check into a loony bin.

718
00:30:25,593 --> 00:30:27,094
I should be checking
in at a Bunny Ranch

719
00:30:27,227 --> 00:30:29,196
with a year supply of dick pills

720
00:30:30,732 --> 00:30:33,200
Yeah, well, I just hope
my mama don't check out.

721
00:30:33,601 --> 00:30:35,936
I'll be sitting here
waiting to collect bread

722
00:30:36,070 --> 00:30:39,039
from the unsavory underworld
of South Central.

723
00:30:45,212 --> 00:30:47,247
Oh, shit!
There go that nigga right there.

724
00:30:47,948 --> 00:30:52,119
I can smell the money already
and it's making my dick hard.

725
00:30:54,254 --> 00:30:55,523
This was always a scheme

726
00:30:55,657 --> 00:30:57,157
we fight to drown,
you know what I mean?

727
00:30:57,291 --> 00:30:58,892
How much do you trust him?

728
00:30:59,026 --> 00:31:01,730
Usually, I don't trust no niggas
as far as I can throw 'em.

729
00:31:01,962 --> 00:31:03,464
Especially no street nigga.

730
00:31:04,231 --> 00:31:06,266
Or white niggas
who listen to hip hop.

731
00:31:06,668 --> 00:31:10,003
But this particular nigga,
he's delivered in the past.

732
00:31:10,137 --> 00:31:11,905
So, let's just say,
he on nigga trans-probation.

733
00:31:14,208 --> 00:31:15,943
In that case, I'll have
one hand on my dick

734
00:31:16,076 --> 00:31:17,144
and the other on my gun.

735
00:31:17,277 --> 00:31:18,979
Yeah, you do it.

736
00:31:26,954 --> 00:31:28,623
What's up, cuz?

737
00:31:29,123 --> 00:31:30,424
I mean, Fuzz.

738
00:31:30,558 --> 00:31:32,459
Cut the fucking
theatrics, Mike-Mike.

739
00:31:33,227 --> 00:31:35,429
You old IG gangsta.

740
00:31:35,730 --> 00:31:36,831
Oh, what the fuck?

741
00:31:36,964 --> 00:31:38,365
You thought I wouldn't
see that shit?

742
00:31:38,566 --> 00:31:40,200
Nigga, stop posting

743
00:31:40,334 --> 00:31:43,003
your personal business
on social media.

744
00:31:43,203 --> 00:31:44,739
The fuck wrong with you?

745
00:31:44,873 --> 00:31:47,609
Yo, this nigga all posed up
with his artillery and shit,

746
00:31:47,742 --> 00:31:51,145
with white powdery substance
all over the motherfuckers.

747
00:31:51,278 --> 00:31:53,815
See, I was in the process
of frying some chicken

748
00:31:53,947 --> 00:31:55,082
when I thought about flexing

749
00:31:55,215 --> 00:31:57,050
this brand new
handcrafted pistola

750
00:31:57,184 --> 00:31:58,620
I just purchased.

751
00:31:58,753 --> 00:32:00,889
The white folks be
on YouTube videos

752
00:32:01,054 --> 00:32:02,690
with their artillery
all the time.

753
00:32:02,824 --> 00:32:04,391
I wanna stun on a nigga too.

754
00:32:04,526 --> 00:32:06,761
And the bitches love that shit.
You know how many followers...

755
00:32:06,895 --> 00:32:08,028
Just shut the fuck up.

756
00:32:08,162 --> 00:32:09,329
The fuck wrong with you?

757
00:32:09,463 --> 00:32:10,665
You ain't white.

758
00:32:10,799 --> 00:32:12,065
And the Feds love that shit too.

759
00:32:12,199 --> 00:32:15,002
And you'll be the first
motherfucker to snitch.

760
00:32:15,135 --> 00:32:17,037
- Fall fucking back, fuck boy.
- Ow!

761
00:32:17,171 --> 00:32:19,006
Stop touching me!
I'll scrub the shit.

762
00:32:20,742 --> 00:32:22,342
Where you get a fucking name
like that, Mike-Mike?

763
00:32:22,710 --> 00:32:25,379
Your mother must've known you
were gonna be a double fuck up.

764
00:32:26,146 --> 00:32:27,281
Look man, did you
motherfuckers come here

765
00:32:27,414 --> 00:32:28,650
to insult me all night

766
00:32:28,783 --> 00:32:30,284
or is you trying to
do some business?

767
00:32:30,417 --> 00:32:31,753
All right, so shut the fuck up.

768
00:32:31,886 --> 00:32:32,887
Where the dough at?

769
00:32:33,020 --> 00:32:34,522
Where the work at?

770
00:32:34,656 --> 00:32:36,089
You fucking peanut-headed

771
00:32:36,223 --> 00:32:38,192
motherfucker, it's cocaine,
not lemonheads.

772
00:32:38,325 --> 00:32:39,828
Get the shit now.

773
00:32:39,960 --> 00:32:41,361
It's in the trunk.

774
00:32:41,495 --> 00:32:43,163
- Mine too.
- Yeah, well do that shit.

775
00:32:43,297 --> 00:32:44,231
Both of y'all pop
these motherfucking trunks

776
00:32:44,364 --> 00:32:46,967
and bring my motherfucking dough

777
00:32:51,271 --> 00:32:52,607
Wait, wait, wait. Hold up.

778
00:32:52,740 --> 00:32:54,208
Hold on up real quick.
Are you sure, partner,

779
00:32:54,341 --> 00:32:56,043
that there's no cameras
nowhere around here?

780
00:32:56,176 --> 00:32:58,947
Not for a mile and a half,
Fig and Adams.

781
00:32:59,079 --> 00:33:00,247
And how do y'all
know all that shit?

782
00:33:00,380 --> 00:33:01,482
We know everything.

783
00:33:02,449 --> 00:33:04,084
Well look man,
I need to get with y'all,

784
00:33:04,218 --> 00:33:06,521
'cause I got this lead
cracking right now.

785
00:33:06,654 --> 00:33:08,388
It's still in the
planning stages.

786
00:33:08,523 --> 00:33:09,456
- It's all...
- Just shut the fuck up

787
00:33:09,591 --> 00:33:10,925
and break this fucking bread.

788
00:33:11,091 --> 00:33:12,326
Yeah, mother-fuck y'all. Man,

789
00:33:12,459 --> 00:33:13,761
you ain't gotta be
so rude and shit.

790
00:33:13,895 --> 00:33:15,697
You supposed to be a lady, man.

791
00:33:15,830 --> 00:33:18,432
A little kindness
will be appreciated.

792
00:33:18,633 --> 00:33:19,601
For example,

793
00:33:19,734 --> 00:33:21,870
would y'all good folks
please pass me

794
00:33:22,002 --> 00:33:25,540
those fine kilograms of powder
that you got for me.

795
00:33:25,673 --> 00:33:26,508
See how I did that?

796
00:33:26,641 --> 00:33:28,108
Please, please.
I use please.

797
00:33:28,242 --> 00:33:29,944
White folks know that language.

798
00:33:31,813 --> 00:33:33,815
Where y'all get this
shit from anyway?

799
00:33:33,948 --> 00:33:35,148
The fairy coke father.

800
00:33:35,282 --> 00:33:36,784
You sure this is 20 grand?

801
00:33:36,918 --> 00:33:38,920
You can count that
high, right, crusty?

802
00:33:39,052 --> 00:33:41,789
Look man, I done had enough
of your motherfucking ass

803
00:33:41,923 --> 00:33:42,891
and all this disrespect.

804
00:33:43,023 --> 00:33:44,526
I'm doing you niggas a favor.

805
00:33:44,659 --> 00:33:46,995
Mason, why don't you put
your cock-a-zoid on a leash?

806
00:33:47,160 --> 00:33:48,830
Man, you reek
of Black and Milds

807
00:33:48,963 --> 00:33:50,163
and disappointment.

808
00:33:50,297 --> 00:33:51,265
Easy, yo,
hold up, hold up.

809
00:33:51,398 --> 00:33:52,332
Wait a minute, what the fuck?

810
00:33:52,466 --> 00:33:54,201
To stall this motherfucker out.

811
00:33:54,401 --> 00:33:57,237
Did I just hear...
we giving these motherfuckers

812
00:33:57,371 --> 00:34:00,708

pure white cane sugar,

00:34:00,842 --> 00:34:03,811
and they dropping off
some fucking 20 racks?

814
00:34:03,945 --> 00:34:06,046
What the fuck wrong with you?
Not on my watch.

815
00:34:06,179 --> 00:34:07,815
Nigga, you know
that smoker prices.

816
00:34:07,949 --> 00:34:10,284
Look man, you lucky
you getting this shit.

817
00:34:10,417 --> 00:34:11,653
Ain't no demand for coke

818
00:34:11,786 --> 00:34:13,353
in the South Central
streets no mo'.

819
00:34:13,755 --> 00:34:15,657
Now, if you get your hands
on some of that meth,

820
00:34:16,056 --> 00:34:17,157
then you holler at me.

821
00:34:17,291 --> 00:34:18,860
'Cause I got a
couple of crackers

822
00:34:18,993 --> 00:34:20,360

823
00:34:20,494 --> 00:34:22,396
that can't wait to buy
some of that speed in bulk.

824
00:34:22,530 --> 00:34:24,398
Talking about pounds, baby.

825
00:34:24,532 --> 00:34:26,333
They say they drier
than a nun's pussy

826
00:34:26,466 --> 00:34:27,936
out in that motherfucker.

827
00:34:28,068 --> 00:34:29,904
And the tweakers is going nuts.

828
00:34:30,038 --> 00:34:33,273
They need that shit, 9-1-1.

829
00:34:33,775 --> 00:34:36,209
Now, can you apple fritter
motherfuckers handle that?

830
00:34:36,343 --> 00:34:37,244
Handle this.

831
00:34:37,377 --> 00:34:38,278
Hey, yo bitch ass nigga!

832
00:34:38,412 --> 00:34:39,881
You almost burned me, man.

833
00:34:40,014 --> 00:34:41,683
Shut the fuck up.

834
00:34:41,816 --> 00:34:44,184

you cast iron bastard.

835
00:34:44,384 --> 00:34:45,720
Hey, fuck you, white boy.

840
00:34:52,994 --> 00:34:54,494

00:34:59,166 --> 00:35:00,568
Anything for Kayla.

And you too, Snooks.

846
00:35:02,469 --> 00:35:04,338
And you, Satin,
nigga you on your own.

847
00:35:10,078 --> 00:35:11,846
How 'bout we go to Tams?

848
00:35:11,980 --> 00:35:12,981
They accept EBT.

849
00:35:13,113 --> 00:35:14,448
And we right over here.

850
00:35:14,582 --> 00:35:17,051
Hell yeah, man.
Tams is fire, man. Ah psht.

851
00:35:17,184 --> 00:35:18,853
That shit ain't
never let me down.

852
00:35:21,288 --> 00:35:23,190
Hey, man, what we

853
00:35:23,891 --> 00:35:25,994
I just gotta handle
some business real quick.

854
00:35:26,126 --> 00:35:27,862
Grab some shit.
We good.

855
00:35:29,363 --> 00:35:31,198
Be right back.

856
00:35:39,607 --> 00:35:40,975
What you
need that for, bro?

857
00:35:41,109 --> 00:35:42,342
Oh, I'll trip right now.

858
00:35:42,476 --> 00:35:43,645
I know
this nigga ain't even

859
00:35:43,778 --> 00:35:44,779
gonna work out.

860
00:35:44,912 --> 00:35:46,080
It ain't even no 24-Hour

861
00:35:46,213 --> 00:35:47,481
Fitnesses in the hood.

862
00:35:47,615 --> 00:35:49,717
I told you not to
trust this nigga, man.

863
00:35:51,385 --> 00:35:52,587
Daddy?

864
00:35:57,157 --> 00:35:58,258
Yes, baby.

865
00:35:58,392 --> 00:36:00,394
I know what I wanted to ask you.

866
00:36:01,261 --> 00:36:02,730
What is an abortion?

867
00:36:04,899 --> 00:36:06,934
Baby, that's grown
folk's conversation.

868
00:36:07,068 --> 00:36:09,804
Where did you even hear
something like that from, baby?

869
00:36:09,937 --> 00:36:12,507
I heard mama and Mike-Mike
talking about it.

870
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:15,677
She said you and hers talking
about it before I was born.

871
00:36:15,810 --> 00:36:17,512
You see?

872
00:36:20,213 --> 00:36:21,115
Scam, this.

873
00:36:21,248 --> 00:36:22,249
Fucking Tasha, bro.

874
00:36:22,382 --> 00:36:24,018
Shit, I be talking about.

875
00:36:26,020 --> 00:36:27,287
Listen sweetie,

876
00:36:27,421 --> 00:36:29,423
the only thing you need
to be worrying about

877
00:36:29,557 --> 00:36:32,627
is getting good grades
and watching your cartoon,

878
00:36:32,760 --> 00:36:33,795
Care Bears.

879
00:36:34,294 --> 00:36:35,495
Okay?

880
00:36:37,297 --> 00:36:38,231
Is that still on?

881
00:36:38,365 --> 00:36:40,367
This bitch is dumb as fuck.

882
00:36:41,102 --> 00:36:42,369
The fuck does that?

883
00:36:42,503 --> 00:36:44,471
Don't worry about it, man

884
00:36:45,006 --> 00:36:47,441
Here this nigga come, bro.

885
00:36:49,577 --> 00:36:50,243
I don't trust
this nigga, man.

886
00:37:03,958 --> 00:37:05,325
Where's your dumbbell at,

887
00:37:05,459 --> 00:37:06,728
dumbbell?

888
00:37:06,861 --> 00:37:08,395
I used it to
get my shit, nigga.

889
00:37:09,130 --> 00:37:11,132
What shit? Like, you mean from
like, your girl house?

890
00:37:11,264 --> 00:37:14,068
Nah. I'm claiming this property
for the first time.

891
00:37:14,202 --> 00:37:15,103
You want a watch, bro?

892
00:37:16,336 --> 00:37:17,905
You always late anyway, nigga.

893
00:37:18,039 --> 00:37:19,439
Nigga, I'll take
that fucking watch.

894
00:37:19,574 --> 00:37:20,908
Nigga, the fuck
you will, nigga.

895
00:37:21,042 --> 00:37:23,243
I'm about to sell this
motherfucker, nigga.

896
00:37:23,410 --> 00:37:24,645
Nigga, I know you didn't just

897
00:37:24,779 --> 00:37:25,980
flock that house
with my fucking baby

898
00:37:26,114 --> 00:37:27,215
in the car, my nigga.

899
00:37:29,316 --> 00:37:30,651
Stupid ass nigga.

900
00:37:30,785 --> 00:37:32,285
Bro, did you
just flock that house

901
00:37:32,419 --> 00:37:33,320
- With my baby...
- Yes, my nigga.

902
00:37:33,453 --> 00:37:34,321
Now relax, bro.

903
00:37:34,454 --> 00:37:35,757
I've been sitting back

904
00:37:35,890 --> 00:37:37,491
watching this house
for two weeks, bro.

905
00:37:37,725 --> 00:37:39,160
Ain't nobody in the house.

906
00:37:39,292 --> 00:37:40,360
Everybody at work.

907
00:37:41,129 --> 00:37:42,830
The only motherfuckers
that be on the block

908
00:37:42,964 --> 00:37:45,133
is two old motherfuckers
that probably got cataracts

909
00:37:45,265 --> 00:37:46,366
or some shit like that, bro.

910
00:37:46,500 --> 00:37:47,902
Bro, what about
cameras, my nigga?

911
00:37:48,035 --> 00:37:50,104
They got cameras on
every house nowadays.

912
00:37:50,238 --> 00:37:51,672
Bro, not exactly, bro.

913
00:37:51,806 --> 00:37:54,509
Ain't no cameras on the
houses next door on both ends.

914
00:37:54,642 --> 00:37:56,244
It's just a couple
down the block, bro,

915
00:37:56,376 --> 00:37:57,812
but it's way out
of view, my nigga.

916
00:37:57,945 --> 00:37:59,446
You know what I'm saying?
We good, bro.

917
00:37:59,580 --> 00:38:03,251
Now relax your nerves
and lunch is on me, bro.

918
00:38:03,383 --> 00:38:04,252
Benihanhan.

919
00:38:04,384 --> 00:38:05,352
Fuck Tams.

920
00:38:06,954 --> 00:38:08,589
My nigga, enjoy the fruits
of the labor, bro.

921
00:38:09,957 --> 00:38:11,259
Finna rap about
this shit, my nigga.

922
00:38:11,391 --> 00:38:13,027
We making stories, bro.

923
00:38:13,161 --> 00:38:14,162
Kick back, relax, my nigga.

924
00:38:15,328 --> 00:38:16,363
You know what I'm saying?

925
00:38:16,496 --> 00:38:17,965
Fuck this nigga Bosco, though.

926
00:38:18,099 --> 00:38:19,432
I give Satin the

927
00:38:19,567 --> 00:38:21,035
benefit of the
doubt in our friendship,

928
00:38:21,169 --> 00:38:23,070
'cause we've been knowing
each other since childhood

929
00:38:23,204 --> 00:38:24,672
and he's always looked out

930
00:38:24,806 --> 00:38:26,406
for homies like a homie
is supposed to in the hood.

931
00:38:26,541 --> 00:38:27,809
But as I get older,

932
00:38:27,942 --> 00:38:29,409
sometimes I question
if our principles

933
00:38:29,544 --> 00:38:30,745
and life philosophies

934
00:38:30,878 --> 00:38:32,013
are on the same page.

935
00:38:32,146 --> 00:38:33,514
That gangster shit getting old.

936
00:38:34,048 --> 00:38:36,416
So, what you got
me here for, OG?

937
00:38:36,551 --> 00:38:38,485
And what you taking
my thumper for?

938
00:38:38,953 --> 00:38:41,155
No, it's
a nice thumper too.

939
00:38:42,223 --> 00:38:44,058
But you don't need
no gun up in here.

940
00:38:44,559 --> 00:38:46,093
This the safest
place in the city.

941
00:38:48,162 --> 00:38:49,462
That's why I see
all this ketchup

942
00:38:49,597 --> 00:38:51,098
on the ground right here?

943
00:38:51,732 --> 00:38:53,301
Well, we eat
a lot of french fries

944
00:38:53,433 --> 00:38:54,802
up in here, little homie.

945
00:38:56,304 --> 00:38:58,539
K.P, the reason you're here

946
00:38:58,906 --> 00:39:00,174
is for training

947
00:39:00,340 --> 00:39:01,642
and reprogramming.

948
00:39:02,743 --> 00:39:05,412
- Oh yeah? And what?
- Yeah.

949
00:39:06,781 --> 00:39:08,415
Well,

950
00:39:08,549 --> 00:39:10,483
conflict resolution for one,

951
00:39:10,718 --> 00:39:15,556
but then let's say
cultural enrichment.

952
00:39:15,690 --> 00:39:17,225
And what I'm getting
out of all of this?

953
00:39:17,357 --> 00:39:18,726
A free pair of Jays?

954
00:39:19,492 --> 00:39:20,695
Nah little nigga.

955
00:39:21,596 --> 00:39:22,630
You get to live

956
00:39:23,731 --> 00:39:26,399
and be a productive
member of society.

957
00:39:26,601 --> 00:39:28,236
Watch your kids grow.

958
00:39:28,368 --> 00:39:29,670
Let them follow suit.

959
00:39:31,138 --> 00:39:33,274
You confusing the
fuck out of me, OG.

960
00:39:33,406 --> 00:39:34,775
But shit, whatever.

961
00:39:36,476 --> 00:39:38,346
Well, if you open up your mind,

962
00:39:38,478 --> 00:39:39,780
your heart will follow.

963
00:39:41,616 --> 00:39:43,217
Hold tight, I got
something for you.

964
00:40:00,735 --> 00:40:02,737
Oh, Pie,
what it do, man?

965
00:40:03,638 --> 00:40:04,605
What it do, man?

966
00:40:04,739 --> 00:40:06,107
Shit, hanging in there, dude.

967
00:40:06,240 --> 00:40:07,675
Hey man, what was
your cousin's name?

968
00:40:07,808 --> 00:40:09,343
The fat-ass who
used to be frying fish

969
00:40:09,476 --> 00:40:10,443
all the time.

970
00:40:10,578 --> 00:40:11,979
Shit, that's vile.
Shamika?

971
00:40:12,113 --> 00:40:13,347
I don't know if
that was her name.

972
00:40:13,480 --> 00:40:14,715
Oh shit. Elizabeth?

973
00:40:14,849 --> 00:40:16,517
Yeah, whatever the...
Hey, hey!

974
00:40:16,651 --> 00:40:17,885
What the fuck this
nigga doing here, man?

975
00:40:19,553 --> 00:40:21,055
Nigga, fuck you, nigga.

976
00:40:21,188 --> 00:40:23,190
- Business man's on mines.
- Hold on.

977
00:40:23,324 --> 00:40:24,358
It's losses, nigga.

978
00:40:25,826 --> 00:40:27,962
G-Wayne, if you
don't drop that gun

979
00:40:28,095 --> 00:40:31,699
and check that nigga-ish
tribalism shit at the door.

980
00:40:32,465 --> 00:40:33,500
Tuck it, nigga.

981
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:36,037
I ain't tucking nothing!

982
00:40:36,170 --> 00:40:37,738
Some gangster
shit going down.

983
00:40:38,706 --> 00:40:39,840
Now, I'm sure you know

984
00:40:39,974 --> 00:40:41,709
what my family
business is, right?

985
00:40:41,876 --> 00:40:43,978
Adam's Funeral Home on Central.

986
00:40:44,845 --> 00:40:46,380
Yeah, so the fuck what.

987
00:40:46,514 --> 00:40:48,049
The - So the fuck what?

988
00:40:48,549 --> 00:40:51,585
I'm sure you
are quite familiar

989
00:40:51,752 --> 00:40:54,622
that we were very
successful last year

990
00:40:55,323 --> 00:40:57,490
in how many bodies
we moved through there.

991
00:40:58,292 --> 00:40:59,994
Including a couple
of your cousins.

992
00:41:03,130 --> 00:41:05,299
Now, if you don't
drop that damn gun,

993
00:41:05,900 --> 00:41:08,302
I'mma forget why
I invited both of y'all.

994
00:41:11,706 --> 00:41:12,707
Thank you.

995
00:41:13,641 --> 00:41:15,576
You know, I oughta to beat
the cowboy shit out of you.

996
00:41:15,710 --> 00:41:16,811
If I don't
whoop his ass first.

997
00:41:16,944 --> 00:41:18,579
Nah, nah nah.
Ain't nobody gonna bust

998
00:41:18,713 --> 00:41:19,981
a grape up in here.

999
00:41:21,582 --> 00:41:26,587
That's why I brought you two
dysfunctional negroes here.

1000
00:41:26,721 --> 00:41:29,190
I wish you niggas
had half that energy

1001
00:41:29,323 --> 00:41:31,292
when y'all was out there
dealing with them white folks.

1002
00:41:31,625 --> 00:41:34,595
Or when the ese's is
pushing the line on niggas.

1003
00:41:36,864 --> 00:41:40,034
Our brown brothers
ain't the real problem.

1004
00:41:40,167 --> 00:41:43,404
And y'all gotta quit this whole
in-house fighting shit.

1005
00:41:43,537 --> 00:41:45,272
My generation
fucked up somewhere.

1006
00:41:45,406 --> 00:41:47,274
We should've nipped
this shit in the bud

1007
00:41:47,408 --> 00:41:48,509
a long time ago.

1008
00:41:50,344 --> 00:41:51,812
But we gonna get it straight.

1009
00:41:53,347 --> 00:41:55,483
Right here, right now.

1010
00:41:57,385 --> 00:41:59,353
So, y'all sit y'all
narrow asses down

1011
00:41:59,487 --> 00:42:01,389
and take a seat at the throne,

1012
00:42:01,922 --> 00:42:03,924
'cause you're kings.

1013
00:42:05,126 --> 00:42:06,127
L.A. Kings.

1014
00:42:07,862 --> 00:42:09,463
Class is in session.

1015
00:42:36,525 --> 00:42:39,126
All right, Snooks, bro,
don't be taking all day, man.

1016
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:41,629
I gotta go see one of my broads.
I ain't had no...

1017
00:42:43,764 --> 00:42:45,699
no cereal in a long time.

1018
00:42:46,033 --> 00:42:48,402
You could have
some of our cereal.

1019
00:42:48,537 --> 00:42:50,171
Daddy did not eat it all.

1020
00:42:50,404 --> 00:42:53,274
Yeah, baby,
you know daddy love his cereal.

1021
00:42:53,407 --> 00:42:56,043
Matter of fact, I'm about to
go eat some right quick.

1022
00:42:56,545 --> 00:42:57,878
Hey, before you go,

1023
00:42:58,679 --> 00:43:00,714
let me know if you
want me to roll,

1024
00:43:00,848 --> 00:43:04,819
so I can take care
of that ese brother of hers.

1025
00:43:04,952 --> 00:43:07,321
Bosco, I'm just
about to go holler

1026
00:43:07,455 --> 00:43:08,722
at my girl right quick, bro.

1027
00:43:08,856 --> 00:43:09,890
It ain't that deep.

1028
00:43:10,024 --> 00:43:11,392
She said she gotta holler at me

1029
00:43:11,526 --> 00:43:13,562
about something she can't
tell me over the phone.

1030
00:43:13,694 --> 00:43:14,695
It probably ain't nothing.

1031
00:43:14,829 --> 00:43:16,197
Plus her brother ain't even here

1032
00:43:16,330 --> 00:43:18,567
He probably out chasing
some trim his self.

1033
00:43:18,699 --> 00:43:20,434
Daddy, what's trim?

1034
00:43:21,536 --> 00:43:24,071
Oh baby, that just mean
you getting a haircut.

1035
00:43:24,205 --> 00:43:25,306
Oh

1036
00:43:25,439 --> 00:43:26,941
Oh, serious though.

1037
00:43:28,609 --> 00:43:30,545
And to this beautiful,

1038
00:43:30,678 --> 00:43:33,380
little beautiful
African princess,

1039
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:36,518
I'll kill for you, baby girl.

1040
00:43:36,650 --> 00:43:38,085
Hey, nigga, relax bro.

1041
00:43:38,219 --> 00:43:40,488
She don't need to be hearing
that type of language.

1042
00:43:40,621 --> 00:43:41,889
Yeah, Bosco.

1043
00:43:42,022 --> 00:43:43,023
You know it's all
love and respect, OG,

1044
00:43:43,157 --> 00:43:45,192
but I can't be having my baby

1045
00:43:45,326 --> 00:43:47,428
exposed to that kind
of lifestyle, you know.

1046
00:43:47,562 --> 00:43:49,463
I gotta protect her from that.

1047
00:43:49,598 --> 00:43:51,132
And I'mma see to it.

1048
00:43:54,301 --> 00:43:57,771
we gotta be able to die
and protect our Black women.

1049
00:43:59,807 --> 00:44:01,142
If anybody,

1050
00:44:01,275 --> 00:44:02,843
I mean, anybody,

1051
00:44:03,277 --> 00:44:05,514
'specially them little
poop butt bastards

1052
00:44:05,646 --> 00:44:07,481
at your school mess with you,

1053
00:44:08,315 --> 00:44:10,519
I'm coming tipping
over fish tanks,

1054
00:44:10,651 --> 00:44:11,952
taking heads off of them cats.

1055
00:44:12,086 --> 00:44:14,556
Hey bro, calm
the fuck down, man.

1056
00:44:14,688 --> 00:44:15,923
- What's wrong with you?
- Yeah Bosco,

1057
00:44:16,056 --> 00:44:17,626
you gotta kick back, man.

1058
00:44:17,758 --> 00:44:19,360
Stall out with all that, man.

1059
00:44:19,493 --> 00:44:20,895
Ain't nobody gotta get hurt.

1060
00:44:21,028 --> 00:44:22,229
I need to just go in here

1061
00:44:22,363 --> 00:44:23,565
and see what my
girl talking about.

1062
00:44:23,697 --> 00:44:25,299
Please, just kick back.

1063
00:44:25,432 --> 00:44:27,001
Yeah, bro.
Go handle your business.

1064
00:44:27,134 --> 00:44:29,403
Man, I got this nigga Bosco, man

1065
00:44:29,538 --> 00:44:31,672
You ain't got nobody, nigga.

1066
00:44:31,805 --> 00:44:35,009
If there's anybody who
got somebody, it's me!

1067
00:44:35,943 --> 00:44:37,111
And Kayla.

1068
00:44:38,112 --> 00:44:39,780
Now, you go on you
little vanilla wafer

1069
00:44:39,914 --> 00:44:41,482
looking like ass nigga.

1070
00:44:41,616 --> 00:44:43,484
And handle your business.

1071
00:44:43,684 --> 00:44:48,455
Now, if something crack off,
you hit me on my cell.

1072
00:44:48,590 --> 00:44:51,292
Hey, man, y'all watch
my daughter, man.

1073
00:44:55,564 --> 00:44:56,797
Y'all chill out.

1074
00:45:00,201 --> 00:45:03,538
Bro, you need to relax, man.
You back there tripping.

1075
00:45:08,976 --> 00:45:10,744
Man, let me tell you something.

1076
00:45:11,580 --> 00:45:14,683
Never fuck with a
broad that got dogs,

1077
00:45:14,815 --> 00:45:17,251
especially female dogs.

1078
00:45:19,153 --> 00:45:21,855
Man, what is you
talking about, bro?

1079
00:45:21,989 --> 00:45:23,390
And why the fuck not?

1080
00:45:23,525 --> 00:45:25,492
'Cause when you
break up with 'em,

1081
00:45:25,627 --> 00:45:28,796
you going to end up missing
one bitch more than the another.

1082
00:45:28,929 --> 00:45:31,533
Trust me on that, my nigga.

1083
00:45:36,303 --> 00:45:37,771
Hola, Donald.

1084
00:45:37,972 --> 00:45:39,840
What's up, Yaya?
Can I come in?

1085
00:45:39,974 --> 00:45:42,109
Yes, yes, you may come
inside.

1086
00:45:45,714 --> 00:45:46,581
Uh...

1087
00:45:46,715 --> 00:45:47,682
if you choose.

1088
00:45:51,418 --> 00:45:54,488
But you know Donald,
life is about choices.

1089
00:45:54,623 --> 00:45:56,257
We all have choices to make.

1090
00:45:59,628 --> 00:46:01,762
Be wise with your choice.

1091
00:46:06,367 --> 00:46:07,535
She ain't slick.

1092
00:46:07,669 --> 00:46:09,604
Mom's either trying
to give me some pussy

1093
00:46:09,738 --> 00:46:10,904
or set a nigga up.

1094
00:46:11,038 --> 00:46:13,040
Either way,
I ain't taking the bait.

1095
00:46:13,240 --> 00:46:15,242
She still fine as fuck though.

1096
00:46:15,376 --> 00:46:16,277
Damn!

1097
00:46:25,052 --> 00:46:26,020
Hey, Snooksie.

1098
00:46:26,153 --> 00:46:27,488
What's up, babe?

1099
00:46:27,622 --> 00:46:28,657
Come here.

1100
00:46:29,591 --> 00:46:31,526
You know you the only one
get away with calling me that.

1101
00:46:31,660 --> 00:46:32,860
My mama don't call me that shit.

1102
00:46:34,261 --> 00:46:37,798
Speaking of mama's,
take a seat.

1103
00:46:39,033 --> 00:46:41,035
Mm, I gotta hear this shit.

1104
00:46:43,837 --> 00:46:45,239
Let's go to my room instead.

1105
00:46:45,372 --> 00:46:46,641
Coming with me.

1106
00:46:46,775 --> 00:46:47,975
Yeah.

1107
00:46:49,843 --> 00:46:51,879
That's where it all started.

1108
00:47:03,223 --> 00:47:04,458
Come on, babe,
what's up though?

1109
00:47:04,592 --> 00:47:06,327
'Cause I can't be in
here long tonight,

1110
00:47:06,460 --> 00:47:08,862
my daughter's in the
car with Satin and Bosco.

1111
00:47:09,664 --> 00:47:10,964
Well...

1112
00:47:11,098 --> 00:47:13,100
you got another baby
cooking in the oven.

1113
00:47:13,233 --> 00:47:14,968
Well, you bullshitting.

1114
00:47:15,102 --> 00:47:16,437
No, I'm not.

1115
00:47:17,071 --> 00:47:19,006
You're gonna be a father again.

1116
00:47:20,240 --> 00:47:21,408
When did this happen?

1117
00:47:22,777 --> 00:47:25,012
Okay, what do you mean,
when did this happen?

1118
00:47:25,145 --> 00:47:26,581
I mean, you have no problem

1119
00:47:26,715 --> 00:47:28,550
with going raw and
leaving in from time to time.

1120
00:47:28,783 --> 00:47:32,486
And if you need a time exactly,
it's about ten weeks.

1121
00:47:32,620 --> 00:47:34,488
Which is two and
a half months, babe.

1122
00:47:34,622 --> 00:47:36,223
Babe, I - I didn't
mean it like that.

1123
00:47:36,357 --> 00:47:39,460
I'm just saying,
I gotta get my shit together.

1124
00:47:39,594 --> 00:47:42,597
Maybe I gotta like,
move out of South Central

1125
00:47:42,731 --> 00:47:44,064
and get a fresh start.

1126
00:47:46,233 --> 00:47:48,135
We can't forget Kayla though.

1127
00:47:48,869 --> 00:47:50,237
No, we won't.

1128
00:47:50,538 --> 00:47:51,573
Babe.

1129
00:48:47,796 --> 00:48:49,062
Bro, you got the strap out

1130
00:48:49,196 --> 00:48:50,931
while my baby in
the car with us, bro?

1131
00:48:51,633 --> 00:48:53,902
Bro, I gotta stay burning, bro.
You know where we at.

1132
00:48:54,034 --> 00:48:56,336
We ain't even 'posed
to be over here, man.

1133
00:48:56,771 --> 00:48:58,472
Enemies come
over here try to trip,

1134
00:48:58,606 --> 00:49:01,041
one of them hatin' ass niggas
gonna get chipped, bro.

1135
00:49:02,877 --> 00:49:05,479
Man, I'm like Linus.
Nigga, this my blanket.

1136
00:49:05,613 --> 00:49:08,650
Man, there he go with
that imaginary thug shit.

1137
00:49:08,783 --> 00:49:11,251
Nigga, you ain't even
a real gangster.

1138
00:49:11,385 --> 00:49:14,021
You a imaginary thug at best.

1139
00:49:14,288 --> 00:49:15,757
You the type of nigga

1140
00:49:15,890 --> 00:49:18,726
that go up and shoot some
shit up every three years

1141
00:49:18,860 --> 00:49:22,229
and then go run out to Victorver
and lay up, while the real G's

1142
00:49:22,362 --> 00:49:24,965
and the real niggas
clean your shit up.

1143
00:49:25,098 --> 00:49:27,635
Rap about that, studio gangster.

1144
00:49:27,769 --> 00:49:31,238
Man, shut your old
sherm head-ass up, nigga.

1145
00:49:31,739 --> 00:49:34,509
Yeah, nigga.
Sherm head ass nigga.

1146
00:49:35,075 --> 00:49:36,611
You don't think I know
your secrets, boy?

1147
00:49:36,744 --> 00:49:39,079
Hey man, will both of
y'all shut the fuck up

1148
00:49:39,213 --> 00:49:41,181
before y'all wake my baby up.
Goddamn!

1149
00:49:41,315 --> 00:49:43,350
Nah, fuck this nigga, man

1150
00:49:44,084 --> 00:49:47,054
Speaking of babies, man.
I got one on the way, man.

1151
00:49:47,187 --> 00:49:48,088
Fuck!

1152
00:49:48,222 --> 00:49:49,657
Are you serious?

1153
00:49:49,924 --> 00:49:51,526
You got a little enchilada

1154
00:49:51,659 --> 00:49:52,727
on the way, boy?

1155
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,328
Man, hell yeah.

1156
00:49:54,461 --> 00:49:56,463
And I don't know
what the fuck I'mma do.

1157
00:49:56,598 --> 00:49:57,699
What you mean?

1158
00:49:57,832 --> 00:49:59,466
I mean, shit, man,
I ain't got no bread,

1159
00:49:59,601 --> 00:50:02,202
I don't got no car,
I don't got no job right now.

1160
00:50:04,371 --> 00:50:06,708
Man, it's all good, bro.
You'll figure this shit out.

1161
00:50:06,841 --> 00:50:09,109
No, we gonna
figure this shit out.

1162
00:50:09,243 --> 00:50:11,378
I got your back, bro.

1163
00:50:12,847 --> 00:50:14,582
Look, man, whatever we do,

1164
00:50:15,115 --> 00:50:16,851
we gotta figure
this shit out quick.

1165
00:50:29,062 --> 00:50:30,899
For front door.

1166
00:50:34,134 --> 00:50:35,435
Hey.

1167
00:50:35,904 --> 00:50:37,104
Hey, beautiful.

1168
00:50:39,039 --> 00:50:40,140
Why you sitting there like that?

1169
00:50:40,808 --> 00:50:46,581
What else should I be doing?
Out fucking around like you?

1170
00:50:46,714 --> 00:50:47,882
Whoa.

1171
00:50:48,583 --> 00:50:50,585
Ca - Can we not
do that just tonight.

1172
00:50:50,718 --> 00:50:51,920
Please, we...

1173
00:50:52,820 --> 00:50:54,556
Baby, we - we've been to
counseling and everything.

1174
00:50:54,689 --> 00:50:56,390
We've been to
counseling, Randall,

1175
00:50:57,025 --> 00:50:59,459
but somehow I think you're
dick didn't make it there.

1176
00:51:01,663 --> 00:51:02,664
Look,

1177
00:51:03,463 --> 00:51:06,034
there's a lot going on
at city hall right now.

1178
00:51:06,266 --> 00:51:07,702
Okay?

1179
00:51:07,835 --> 00:51:09,303
You know what it's like
being the mayor of a city

1180
00:51:09,436 --> 00:51:10,772
like South Central.

1181
00:51:11,005 --> 00:51:13,875
Almost as hard as it is
being the wife of a mayor

1182
00:51:14,008 --> 00:51:15,677
of a city like South Central.

1183
00:51:18,178 --> 00:51:20,548
Lobbyists wanna
line your pockets.

1184
00:51:21,315 --> 00:51:23,851
Every city employee
wants to kiss your ass.

1185
00:51:23,985 --> 00:51:25,587
And every sack chasing female

1186
00:51:25,720 --> 00:51:27,956
is fighting over who's gonna
suck your dick next.

1187
00:51:28,088 --> 00:51:29,023
Whoa, wait.

1188
00:51:29,156 --> 00:51:30,625
What's gotten into you tonight?

1189
00:51:31,491 --> 00:51:32,492
Not you.

1190
00:51:33,293 --> 00:51:36,196
That's been a recurring
theme lately, hasn't it?

1191
00:51:39,934 --> 00:51:40,969
Uh-uh.

1192
00:51:41,869 --> 00:51:45,607
Remember who you are,
not who people want you to be.

1193
00:51:49,944 --> 00:51:51,178
Yeah?

1194
00:51:54,015 --> 00:51:55,683
Now that I've gotten
that off my chest,

1195
00:51:55,817 --> 00:51:58,318
I feel like I can
sleep better at night.

1196
00:51:59,286 --> 00:52:01,154
The question is, can you?

1197
00:52:02,322 --> 00:52:04,592
Brandy, you knew
what you signed up for.

1198
00:52:05,627 --> 00:52:06,694
Funny,

1199
00:52:06,995 --> 00:52:08,195
women w- you - you want

1200
00:52:08,328 --> 00:52:10,497
a brother
in the - in the limelight.

1201
00:52:11,198 --> 00:52:12,634
When shit gets too bright,

1202
00:52:12,767 --> 00:52:14,702
you wanna step in there
and you wanna block his shine.

1203
00:52:18,472 --> 00:52:19,641
Yes, I have
to divide my time

1204
00:52:19,774 --> 00:52:23,343
between my constituents,
my job, and you.

1205
00:52:23,477 --> 00:52:25,212
So, what do you want?

1206
00:52:26,047 --> 00:52:28,148
Y - You want 50% of a good man

1207
00:52:28,281 --> 00:52:32,252
or you want a 100%
of a bad one?

1208
00:52:32,386 --> 00:52:33,588
Let me know.

1209
00:52:34,321 --> 00:52:35,623
You add those numbers up and

1210
00:52:35,757 --> 00:52:38,325
if you don't like the
math you see, then well,

1211
00:52:39,226 --> 00:52:41,428
I wish you well in your search.

1212
00:52:42,130 --> 00:52:43,230
I'm just saying.

1213
00:52:43,363 --> 00:52:45,165
What the fuck?
What?

1214
00:52:45,332 --> 00:52:47,234
What are you just saying?

1215
00:52:52,774 --> 00:52:54,174
I'm sorry.

1216
00:52:54,709 --> 00:52:55,777
Sorry.

1217
00:52:57,679 --> 00:52:58,713
I'm sorry.

1218
00:53:00,280 --> 00:53:01,314
Baby,

1219
00:53:01,448 --> 00:53:03,350
I love every fiber
of you.

1220
00:53:09,356 --> 00:53:11,358
I love everything about you.

1221
00:53:15,997 --> 00:53:21,002
You just,
you gotta let me be me, baby.

1222
00:53:21,234 --> 00:53:22,537
Hmm.

1223
00:53:26,273 --> 00:53:27,709
And I love you too.

1224
00:53:31,344 --> 00:53:33,514
I was here before all this shit.

1225
00:53:35,550 --> 00:53:40,555
You remember that
if shit ever goes south.

1226
00:53:40,688 --> 00:53:43,024
who's gonna be there then, huh?

1227
00:53:49,296 --> 00:53:50,665
You got some, uh,

1228
00:53:52,232 --> 00:53:54,202
fan mail
on the table.

1229
00:54:29,637 --> 00:54:31,338
Shit!

1230
00:54:51,125 --> 00:54:52,292
What you up to in here?

1231
00:54:52,425 --> 00:54:53,828
Oh, hey, mama.

1232
00:54:54,662 --> 00:54:56,631
I'm just updating
your motherboard

1233
00:54:56,764 --> 00:54:58,099
and your wireless adapter

1234
00:54:58,232 --> 00:55:02,069
and most importantly,
your operating system.

1235
00:55:03,303 --> 00:55:04,705
This computer old as hell.

1236
00:55:04,839 --> 00:55:06,841
I'm about to take this computer
from the Flintstones

1237
00:55:06,974 --> 00:55:08,341
to the Jetsons.

1238
00:55:08,475 --> 00:55:09,811
It got, like, sleep apnea.

1239
00:55:09,944 --> 00:55:11,444
You know the late
night infomercials?

1240
00:55:11,579 --> 00:55:13,181
They ain't got no cure

1241
00:55:13,313 --> 00:55:14,649
for this old-ass piece of shi...

1242
00:55:14,782 --> 00:55:16,851
I mean, um, I got the
cure right here, mama.

1243
00:55:16,984 --> 00:55:18,186
Mm-hmm.

1244
00:55:19,086 --> 00:55:22,156
Uh, when you gonna turn
them skills into a paying gig?

1245
00:55:23,423 --> 00:55:24,725
Mama, I'm trying.

1246
00:55:25,560 --> 00:55:27,929
But Silicon Beach
ain't hiring no niggas.

1247
00:55:28,696 --> 00:55:30,064
It's like, the white man,

1248
00:55:30,198 --> 00:55:31,766
he just gonna hire another
pink motherfucker,

1249
00:55:31,899 --> 00:55:35,036
so they don't jeopardize
the white power structure.

1250
00:55:35,169 --> 00:55:38,306
Ain't no niggas got no
tech companies around here.

1251
00:55:38,506 --> 00:55:39,941
I'm reading all these brochures

1252
00:55:40,074 --> 00:55:42,643
talking about technology
is the present and the future.

1253
00:55:42,777 --> 00:55:44,879
They don't got
no niggas in the plan.

1254
00:55:46,379 --> 00:55:47,982
It's also a time and era

1255
00:55:48,115 --> 00:55:50,818
for an entrepreneur
to thrive in this society.

1256
00:55:51,252 --> 00:55:52,485
Let that sink in.

1257
00:55:53,453 --> 00:55:54,655
Either way, I hope something

1258
00:55:54,789 --> 00:55:57,058
pop off for you real soon.

1259
00:55:57,191 --> 00:55:58,893
Me too mama, 'cause

1260
00:56:00,928 --> 00:56:01,963
Jackie pregnant.

1261
00:56:03,463 --> 00:56:05,566
Goddammit, Donald!

1262
00:56:06,567 --> 00:56:09,303
Don't you know how
to use a condom?

1263
00:56:10,238 --> 00:56:13,473
They come in like 13 different
brands and different flavors

1264
00:56:13,608 --> 00:56:15,176
and colors and shit.

1265
00:56:15,309 --> 00:56:18,079
And don't you know
them Mexican girls get pregnant

1266
00:56:18,212 --> 00:56:20,581
if you look at them for
more than five minutes.

1267
00:56:21,082 --> 00:56:23,651
Mama, you think you
gotta tell me that, mama?

1268
00:56:24,352 --> 00:56:25,553
I know.

1269
00:56:26,220 --> 00:56:27,487
Every time I try to make

1270
00:56:27,622 --> 00:56:29,023
a positive move in
the right direction,

1271
00:56:29,156 --> 00:56:31,626
it seem like something
just jump in my way.

1272
00:56:31,792 --> 00:56:36,831
Yeah. Well this time,
your peter jumped in the way.

1273
00:56:36,964 --> 00:56:37,999
Again.

1274
00:56:40,768 --> 00:56:42,402
Is she keeping it?

1275
00:56:43,771 --> 00:56:45,373
Hell, what you think, ma?

1276
00:56:46,307 --> 00:56:48,376
When's the last time
you seen a Mexican

1277
00:56:48,609 --> 00:56:50,544
in a Planned Parenthood ad?

1278
00:56:50,678 --> 00:56:52,747
That's why there's
so many of 'em.

1279
00:56:53,514 --> 00:56:55,750
Well, I guess I probably
should tell you

1280
00:56:55,883 --> 00:56:57,718
that I'm selling this house.

1281
00:56:58,485 --> 00:57:00,154
And I'm moving out to Phoenix.

1282
00:57:00,288 --> 00:57:02,723
I got a good job
opportunity out there

1283
00:57:02,857 --> 00:57:06,127
and I need a change of scenery.

1284
00:57:06,260 --> 00:57:07,395
This place

1285
00:57:07,528 --> 00:57:09,196
is not good for
Black folks no more,

1286
00:57:09,330 --> 00:57:10,631
as I'm sure you already know.

1287
00:57:10,765 --> 00:57:13,534
Mama, what am I supposed
to do now, mama?

1288
00:57:13,668 --> 00:57:15,970
You're supposed to man up.

1289
00:57:23,110 --> 00:57:25,680
Look, Mr. Samir,
I can't afford to pay you

1290
00:57:25,813 --> 00:57:28,149
three times the amount
of the rent that I'm already

1291
00:57:28,282 --> 00:57:29,482
currently paying you.

1292
00:57:29,617 --> 00:57:30,551
Look, I'm sorry.

1293
00:57:30,685 --> 00:57:32,153
The decision has been made.

1294
00:57:32,286 --> 00:57:34,055
You have three months
to find a new place

1295
00:57:34,188 --> 00:57:37,291
to sell you sweet potato pies,
which by the way, are the bomb,

1296
00:57:37,425 --> 00:57:38,893
no pun intended.

1297
00:57:39,026 --> 00:57:41,062
And by the way, I'll take
a slice with some coffee.

1298
00:57:41,262 --> 00:57:44,165
I've been in this
same location since '94.

1299
00:57:44,298 --> 00:57:45,800
I fixed your air conditioner,

1300
00:57:45,933 --> 00:57:48,501
I fixed all the leaks in
the roof, I replaced the floor.

1301
00:57:48,736 --> 00:57:50,304
How could you do this to me?

1302
00:57:51,772 --> 00:57:53,207
And how the hell
am I supposed to

1303
00:57:53,341 --> 00:57:56,010
find a new location
to move my business

1304
00:57:56,143 --> 00:57:58,346
and bring all my
customers with me?

1305
00:57:58,478 --> 00:57:59,547
What customers?

1306
00:57:59,680 --> 00:58:00,982
Do I look like Stevie Wonder?

1307
00:58:01,115 --> 00:58:03,250
Because I don't see
no ribbon in the sky.

1308
00:58:03,384 --> 00:58:05,987
This ain't right and
you know it's not right.

1309
00:58:06,887 --> 00:58:09,523
These customers.

1310
00:58:09,690 --> 00:58:11,025
Hey, uh, Black Panthers,

1311
00:58:11,158 --> 00:58:12,626
she'll be with you
in just a minute, huh?

1312
00:58:12,760 --> 00:58:14,795
Yeah, well, he'll be
with you right now.

1313
00:58:14,929 --> 00:58:15,730
Yeah.

1314
00:58:15,863 --> 00:58:17,098
Take a seat, Sami.

1315
00:58:17,898 --> 00:58:19,834
That is what Virginia Slim
calls you, right?

1316
00:58:19,967 --> 00:58:22,737
Hey, who is this
Virginia Slim you speak of?

1317
00:58:22,870 --> 00:58:24,705
I quit smoking in the '70s.

1318
00:58:26,974 --> 00:58:30,144
Sit your Figueroa prostitute
patronizing ass down.

1319
00:58:30,277 --> 00:58:32,046
And what is this
guy talking about?

1320
00:58:32,179 --> 00:58:33,280
I don't love these hoes.

1321
00:58:33,414 --> 00:58:35,683
Sit yo' ass down
before I slap the taste

1322
00:58:35,816 --> 00:58:37,585
of slurpee juice out your mouth.

1323
00:58:50,431 --> 00:58:51,732
Check this out, homie.

1324
00:58:53,534 --> 00:58:55,936
We know why you're
raising Brenda's rent.

1325
00:58:56,937 --> 00:58:58,773
You're trying to
sell this property

1326
00:58:58,906 --> 00:59:01,375
to that group of
Caucasian developers

1327
00:59:01,510 --> 00:59:02,777
who's sole intent

1328
00:59:02,910 --> 00:59:05,746
is to gentrify this
highly coveted area.

1329
00:59:07,448 --> 00:59:10,651
We're here to stop the bleeding
from you blood suckers.

1330
00:59:10,785 --> 00:59:15,689
This place is for sale
and I can't stop it.

1331
00:59:15,823 --> 00:59:17,725
You will stop it.

1332
00:59:19,927 --> 00:59:22,063
We got receipts on you.

1333
00:59:22,430 --> 00:59:24,665
Slim keeps great records.

1334
00:59:24,799 --> 00:59:27,802
Oh, yeah, remember
it's the tech age. Click.

1335
00:59:30,671 --> 00:59:34,275
I'm sure that pretty little wife
of yours that's half your age

1336
00:59:34,408 --> 00:59:37,311
won't take too kind to find out
about your patronizing

1337
00:59:37,445 --> 00:59:40,915
to them Figueroa slut bags
from Virginia Slim.

1338
00:59:41,048 --> 00:59:43,117
Who is this Virginia Slim?

1339
00:59:43,250 --> 00:59:44,318
I thought I was donating

1340
00:59:44,452 --> 00:59:46,420
to the Sally
Struthers Children's

1341
00:59:46,555 --> 00:59:48,022
of African Nations.

1342
00:59:48,155 --> 00:59:49,190
Knock it off.

1343
00:59:51,492 --> 00:59:53,060
Here's what we're gonna do.

1344
00:59:55,262 --> 00:59:56,764
You're gonna renew
Brenda's lease

1345
00:59:56,897 --> 00:59:59,700
for two years
and at the end of the lease,

1346
00:59:59,834 --> 01:00:00,901
she's gonna have the option

1347
01:00:01,035 --> 01:00:03,037
to purchase this
place from you

1348
01:00:03,904 --> 01:00:05,473
at fair market value.

1349
01:00:06,040 --> 01:00:07,708
Now, taking Brenda's
check to the bank

1350
01:00:07,842 --> 01:00:09,276
is a lot cheaper than
that white bitch

1351
01:00:09,410 --> 01:00:11,546
taking your dumb
ass to the cleaners.

1352
01:00:15,816 --> 01:00:17,451
You dig what I'm saying?

1353
01:00:27,728 --> 01:00:28,963
I dig.

1354
01:00:29,663 --> 01:00:30,931
Good.

1355
01:00:31,799 --> 01:00:33,501
So, what's this for?

1356
01:00:33,634 --> 01:00:34,668
That's a reminder.

1357
01:00:35,302 --> 01:00:37,972
What happens if you happen
to renege on this deal.

1358
01:00:42,611 --> 01:00:43,644
Thank you.

1359
01:00:43,777 --> 01:00:45,079
Hey, no problem.

1360
01:00:46,981 --> 01:00:48,682
Hey, do you have any of those

1361
01:00:48,816 --> 01:00:50,619
slamming sweet
potato pies to go?

1362
01:00:50,751 --> 01:00:52,786
Of course I do.

1363
01:00:53,721 --> 01:00:54,889
Can I have a slice?

1364
01:01:04,533 --> 01:01:06,700
All in the day's work,
right Sun-dizzy?

1365
01:01:08,269 --> 01:01:09,837
Yeah, but our work
ain't done yet, bruh.

1366
01:01:09,970 --> 01:01:11,472
Oh, yeah. Wha...

1367
01:01:11,606 --> 01:01:12,973
Wait, what else we got to do?

1368
01:01:13,440 --> 01:01:16,410
Hey, man, we got to tend
to these sweet potato pies.

1369
01:01:16,545 --> 01:01:17,811
Right.

1370
01:01:17,945 --> 01:01:19,280
Nigga, I was like,
I don't see no more

1371
01:01:19,413 --> 01:01:21,516
ghetto superhero work
on my cards for today.

1372
01:01:21,650 --> 01:01:22,850
Oh. True, true,

1373
01:01:22,983 --> 01:01:25,620
but righting 400 plus
years of wrong

1374
01:01:25,753 --> 01:01:27,556
is a tireless job, my brother.

1375
01:01:27,688 --> 01:01:28,557
Yeah, I feel you.

1376
01:01:30,124 --> 01:01:31,759
Yeah, you know what,
shoot, I'mma need a nap

1377
01:01:31,892 --> 01:01:32,927
after grabbing on these joints.

1378
01:01:33,060 --> 01:01:35,196
Hey, even us black superheroes

1379
01:01:35,329 --> 01:01:36,897
need to rest,

1380
01:01:37,031 --> 01:01:38,299
Especially us nigga ones.

1381
01:01:38,432 --> 01:01:39,534
The fuck!

1382
01:01:44,238 --> 01:01:45,540
No, no, no, no, no,
no, no, no. Not here, not here.

1383
01:01:45,674 --> 01:01:46,675
Not now.

1384
01:01:46,807 --> 01:01:47,576
Weren't you hit, big homie?

1385
01:01:47,708 --> 01:01:48,643
No, I'm good.

1386
01:01:48,776 --> 01:01:50,377
But, who the fuck was that?

1387
01:01:50,512 --> 01:01:51,979
Seemed like some
old random shit.

1388
01:01:52,112 --> 01:01:54,281
Nah. Ain't nothing
random around here.

1389
01:01:55,015 --> 01:01:55,983
It wasn't no niggas, though.

1390
01:01:56,116 --> 01:01:57,351
Shit, how you know that?

1391
01:01:57,484 --> 01:01:59,153
No, I seen a little
piece of his skin.

1392
01:01:59,286 --> 01:02:01,488
Could be the Mexicans starting
up on them niggas again.

1393
01:02:01,956 --> 01:02:03,924
Yeah. Could be.

1394
01:02:04,693 --> 01:02:05,426
Could be not.

1395
01:02:05,560 --> 01:02:07,094
Mm-hmm.

1396
01:02:07,228 --> 01:02:08,796
But one way or another, we
gonna find out who did this shit

1397
01:02:10,030 --> 01:02:11,600
Let's get the fuck out of here.

1398
01:02:11,966 --> 01:02:13,602
Dropped my god damn pie, man.

1399
01:02:17,871 --> 01:02:19,073
Hey, Dee, shit
done slowed down,

1400
01:02:19,206 --> 01:02:20,741
I'm finna go take my lunch.

1401
01:02:20,874 --> 01:02:22,810
Oh yeah, my nigga.
Where you gonna eat at?

1402
01:02:22,943 --> 01:02:24,178
Over there at
Nate's Fish Market.

1403
01:02:24,311 --> 01:02:26,013
- Nate's Fish Market?
- Yeah.

1404
01:02:26,146 --> 01:02:27,549
Is Natalie working today?

1405
01:02:27,682 --> 01:02:29,049
- She might be.
- Come here, my nigga.

1406
01:02:29,183 --> 01:02:30,685
Now, you know
she like you, right?

1407
01:02:30,818 --> 01:02:32,319
- Yeah.
- So look,

1408
01:02:32,453 --> 01:02:33,722
I'mma need you to go along
with that and play along,

1409
01:02:33,854 --> 01:02:34,755
'cause we can get a special.

1410
01:02:34,888 --> 01:02:35,756
Special?

1411
01:02:35,889 --> 01:02:37,424
A dinner special.

1412
01:02:37,559 --> 01:02:39,594
Damn them lunch specials,
'cause they ain't about shit.

1413
01:02:39,728 --> 01:02:40,961
I need the dinner lick.

1414
01:02:41,095 --> 01:02:42,896
I'm talking about
with extra jumbo shrimp.

1415
01:02:43,030 --> 01:02:43,964
All right, I got you.

1416
01:02:44,098 --> 01:02:45,899
You got my sides?

1417
01:02:46,033 --> 01:02:47,368
Same shit, different day.

1418
01:02:47,501 --> 01:02:49,870
No. It ain't the same
day and there's new shit

1419
01:02:50,004 --> 01:02:51,740
and I want tartar
sauce without pickles.

1420
01:02:51,872 --> 01:02:53,173
Pickles?

1421
01:02:53,307 --> 01:02:54,308
Yeah, and I don't
want no to Tilapia.

1422
01:02:54,441 --> 01:02:55,209
All right, nigga.

1423
01:02:55,342 --> 01:02:56,777
No nigga. It ain't all right.

01:02:56,910 --> 01:02:58,178
Get the fuck out the way.

Hey, man, the

You sure, partner?

Don't make us have to come back.

1463
01:04:39,714 --> 01:04:40,981
Shit, well if

1464
01:04:41,115 --> 01:04:42,383

But you can't have none.

01:04:47,522 --> 01:04:50,324
Fuck out my shop,

I heard it's hot in them streets

1472
01:04:57,231 --> 01:04:59,366

1473
01:04:59,500 --> 01:05:00,635

You got my shit?

1482
01:05:19,987 --> 01:05:21,723
Yeah. There you go.

1483
01:05:23,591 --> 01:05:24,559
This a half?

1484
01:05:24,692 --> 01:05:26,393
It's more than half.
Same price.

1485
01:05:29,798 --> 01:05:31,733
I got you, but do you
mind giving me a review

1486
01:05:31,866 --> 01:05:33,066
after this transaction?

1487
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:34,903
Man, get the fuck

1488
01:05:35,035 --> 01:05:36,503
Laters.

01:05:36,805 --> 01:05:37,906

1491
01:05:39,874 --> 01:05:42,976

01:05:43,110 --> 01:05:44,344
Yeah.

1493
01:05:49,349 --> 01:05:50,652
Hey, Bosco.

1494
01:05:50,785 --> 01:05:52,186
Hey, come in the house, bro.

1495
01:05:52,319 --> 01:05:54,622
Shit, you should be helping me.

1496
01:05:54,856 --> 01:05:56,223
I don't know
who them niggas is.

1497
01:05:56,356 --> 01:05:57,926
Probably some eses.

1498
01:05:58,158 --> 01:05:59,928
Worried about
these motherfuckers, man?

1499
01:06:00,060 --> 01:06:01,128
OG Bosco.

1500
01:06:01,696 --> 01:06:03,030
Man, you embarrass
me eating cereal.

1501
01:06:03,163 --> 01:06:04,064
I just need to hydrate.

1502
01:06:04,198 --> 01:06:05,966
Nigga, where the water at?

1503
01:06:09,203 --> 01:06:11,138
I don't know them niggas, man.

1504
01:06:23,585 --> 01:06:24,652
Oh shit!

1505
01:06:24,786 --> 01:06:26,754
What's up,
young player partner?

1506
01:06:26,987 --> 01:06:28,222
Damn!

1507
01:06:29,056 --> 01:06:29,958
My nigga.

1508
01:06:30,090 --> 01:06:31,091
What's happening?

1509
01:06:31,225 --> 01:06:32,760
Somebody fucking with you?

1510
01:06:32,894 --> 01:06:33,862
Just let me know,

1511
01:06:33,994 --> 01:06:35,964
'cause you know I got my hammer

1512
01:06:36,096 --> 01:06:37,130

1513
01:06:37,264 --> 01:06:38,332
And nigga, I'm just begging

1514
01:06:38,465 --> 01:06:40,100
to send some niggas to the ER

1515
01:06:40,234 --> 01:06:41,168
or mortuary, if not,

1516
01:06:41,301 --> 01:06:42,837
nigga, OG Bosco.

1517
01:06:42,971 --> 01:06:44,004
No, man. Bosco,

1518
01:06:44,137 --> 01:06:45,807
I got a DA reject, man.

1519
01:06:45,940 --> 01:06:47,307
This shit official.

1520
01:06:47,441 --> 01:06:50,143
Talking about
a lack of evidence.

1521
01:06:50,377 --> 01:06:52,479
For real?
My nigga!

1522
01:06:52,881 --> 01:06:54,481
Hell yeah, man.

1523
01:06:54,849 --> 01:06:56,016
It say, my alcohol level

1524
01:06:56,149 --> 01:06:57,852
was under a .5

1525
01:06:57,986 --> 01:06:59,521
and under the legal limit.

1526
01:07:00,387 --> 01:07:01,723
Nigga, fuck yeah.

1527
01:07:01,856 --> 01:07:03,558
Man, hell no, nigga,
let me see this shit.

1528
01:07:03,691 --> 01:07:05,259
I don't trust
them crackers, man.

1529
01:07:05,392 --> 01:07:06,928
They just setting you
up not to go to court.

1530
01:07:07,060 --> 01:07:08,730
'Cause man these pigs are
throwing they badge.

1531
01:07:08,863 --> 01:07:10,197

- Fuck outta here.

1532
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:12,634
Bosco.

1533
01:07:13,367 --> 01:07:14,802
What's that, bro?

1534
01:07:15,670 --> 01:07:16,838
Man...

1535
01:07:16,971 --> 01:07:18,338
What is that, bro?

1536
01:07:18,472 --> 01:07:20,374
Nigga, it's just a little
something to get me by.

1537
01:07:20,508 --> 01:07:21,876
Or something to get you high.

1538
01:07:22,010 --> 01:07:22,977
What is that, bro?

1539
01:07:23,110 --> 01:07:24,579
That ain't no weed, my nigga.

1540
01:07:27,214 --> 01:07:28,148
Man, it's...

1541
01:07:28,282 --> 01:07:29,984
it's that bitch crystal.

1542
01:07:30,117 --> 01:07:32,252
Meth, nigga!
Are you serious, nigga?

1543
01:07:32,386 --> 01:07:34,187
You gotta be fucking
with me, Bosco.

1544
01:07:34,321 --> 01:07:35,924
Meth, nigga?

1545
01:07:36,891 --> 01:07:38,927
Man, that shit'll take you down
a dark ass road, my nigga.

1546
01:07:39,092 --> 01:07:40,028
That shit'll fuck you up.

1547
01:07:40,160 --> 01:07:41,328
That's white people shit, bro.

1548
01:07:41,461 --> 01:07:43,397
That shit ain't
for us, my nigga.

1549
01:07:48,335 --> 01:07:49,671
I know you love me.

1550
01:07:50,672 --> 01:07:52,105
But OG Bosco,

1551
01:07:54,509 --> 01:07:56,410
he bought a ticket
a long time ago.

1552
01:07:57,311 --> 01:07:58,780
Let me enjoy my trip, man.

1553
01:07:58,913 --> 01:08:00,280
That's all I got left.

1554
01:08:01,415 --> 01:08:02,884
And - and come on, man.

1555
01:08:03,017 --> 01:08:04,919
Lighten the mood up, man.
You fucking with my high.

1556
01:08:05,053 --> 01:08:06,153
Listen, I'm OG Bosco.

1557
01:08:06,286 --> 01:08:07,922
I'mma be all right.

1558
01:08:08,056 --> 01:08:09,222
I got work to do.

1559
01:08:09,356 --> 01:08:11,258
I'm functioning, man.
I got this shit.

1560
01:08:11,391 --> 01:08:12,927
I'mma be all right.

1561
01:08:13,061 --> 01:08:14,696
OG Bosco, nigga.

1562
01:08:15,763 --> 01:08:16,798
Player partner.

1563
01:08:16,931 --> 01:08:18,398
It's
painful to sit back

1564
01:08:18,533 --> 01:08:19,867
and watch Bosco go
through these struggles.

1565
01:08:21,435 --> 01:08:22,770
I know there gotta
be something I can do.

1566
01:08:22,904 --> 01:08:24,371
Little nigga, you
gonna make me tear up.

1567
01:08:24,505 --> 01:08:25,974
Even as
the little homie,

1568
01:08:26,106 --> 01:08:30,044
it gotta be something.
Or maybe he just too far gone.

1569
01:08:30,845 --> 01:08:32,279
I don't know.

1570
01:08:32,412 --> 01:08:33,848
Just add this to
all the other stuff

1571
01:08:33,982 --> 01:08:35,415
weighing on me right now.

1572
01:08:35,550 --> 01:08:39,252
There gotta be a quick solution
to fix all this shit.

1573
01:09:01,408 --> 01:09:02,644
Ernie T.

1574
01:09:03,310 --> 01:09:05,345
Gots to
be more careful.

1575
01:09:07,115 --> 01:09:08,983
Snooks, or should I say,

1576
01:09:09,117 --> 01:09:12,152
inmate 777-93-11.

1577
01:09:12,285 --> 01:09:13,153
You know what,

1578
01:09:13,286 --> 01:09:14,589
I done told Esther

1579
01:09:14,722 --> 01:09:16,124
about leaving that
damn front door open.

1580
01:09:16,256 --> 01:09:17,825
You know what?
She gonna mess around

1581
01:09:17,959 --> 01:09:20,327
and let one of these janky ass
street negroes come up here

1582
01:09:20,460 --> 01:09:22,162
and jack Ernie T.
for his duckets.

1583
01:09:22,295 --> 01:09:23,865
When she knows they saw me

1584
01:09:23,998 --> 01:09:25,933
go to that versatell
machine this afternoon.

1585
01:09:26,067 --> 01:09:28,870
Ernie T, I'll tell you what, you
always about your money, man.

1586
01:09:29,003 --> 01:09:30,104
You damn right, boy.

1587
01:09:30,237 --> 01:09:31,539
'Cause let me
tell you something,

1588
01:09:31,673 --> 01:09:34,474
a man is only as valuable
as his currency.

1589
01:09:34,609 --> 01:09:37,210
If you only got
$2 in your pocket,

1590
01:09:37,344 --> 01:09:39,212
you just a $2 nigga.

1591
01:09:39,346 --> 01:09:40,748
But I digress.

1592
01:09:42,884 --> 01:09:44,284
Why you here, boy?
Did you get that check

1593
01:09:44,418 --> 01:09:45,285
I sent you in the
mail young blood?

1594
01:09:45,419 --> 01:09:46,721
I did get the check,

1595
01:09:46,854 --> 01:09:48,188
and you shorted me
on some overtime too.

1596
01:09:48,321 --> 01:09:49,423
That wasn't cool, Ernie.

1597
01:09:49,557 --> 01:09:52,325
Oh,
man Donald.

1598
01:09:52,459 --> 01:09:55,228
Now you know Ernie T.
don't pay no overtime

1599
01:09:55,362 --> 01:09:57,732
less you call the labor
board on a nigga.

1600
01:09:57,865 --> 01:09:58,866
It's cool, Ernie.

1601
01:09:59,000 --> 01:10:00,367
So, we gonna make
a lot more money.

1602
01:10:00,500 --> 01:10:02,202
I'm here to get my job back.

1603
01:10:02,937 --> 01:10:05,472
Uh, yeah, but I can't
hire no convicts.

1604
01:10:05,606 --> 01:10:07,274
You know, my
insurance won't let me

1605
01:10:07,407 --> 01:10:09,376
hire legal process servers

1606
01:10:09,510 --> 01:10:11,179
with a criminal record.

1607
01:10:11,311 --> 01:10:12,245
Ernie, I'm innocent.

1608
01:10:12,379 --> 01:10:13,246
I got a DA reject.

1609
01:10:13,380 --> 01:10:14,749
You mean the

1610
01:10:14,882 --> 01:10:16,184
court system's backed up
and they ain't got time

1611
01:10:16,316 --> 01:10:17,384
to deal with yo monkey ass.

1612
01:10:17,518 --> 01:10:19,252
I mean, you got over.

1613
01:10:19,520 --> 01:10:21,321
Go play the lotto, negro.

1614
01:10:21,455 --> 01:10:22,322
You're blessed.

1615
01:10:22,456 --> 01:10:23,725
Nah, Ernie, I'm serious.

1616
01:10:23,858 --> 01:10:25,993
I just left the DMV.
I'm good over there too.

1617
01:10:26,127 --> 01:10:27,494
I'm ready to get my job back.

1618
01:10:27,628 --> 01:10:29,262
Look...

1619
01:10:29,897 --> 01:10:32,100
the truth is, young blood,
I had to hire somebody

1620
01:10:32,232 --> 01:10:33,634
to take over your workload.

1621
01:10:33,768 --> 01:10:35,770
I got two new clients,
there was so much business

1622
01:10:35,903 --> 01:10:38,906
I had to turn down money,
and you know

1623
01:10:39,040 --> 01:10:41,943
how Ernie T.
don't like to miss no dollars.

1624
01:10:42,076 --> 01:10:43,477
Ernie, you gave my job away?

1625
01:10:43,611 --> 01:10:44,879
To a Mexican fella.

1626
01:10:45,012 --> 01:10:47,115
He came in here and he
works for 50% less money

1627
01:10:47,247 --> 01:10:49,117
and a 100% less attitude.

1628
01:10:49,249 --> 01:10:52,120
Come on Ernie, man,
you know I need this job, man.

1629
01:10:52,252 --> 01:10:53,121
Okay, okay.

1630
01:10:53,253 --> 01:10:54,354
Okay look,

1631
01:10:54,488 --> 01:10:56,124
I'll hire you back, all right.

1632
01:10:56,256 --> 01:10:57,491
But you gonna have to take

1633
01:10:57,625 --> 01:10:58,926
the same pay Javier
takes, all right,

1634
01:10:59,060 --> 01:11:01,294
which is 50% of
your previous rate.

1635
01:11:01,428 --> 01:11:02,530
That's the best I can do.

1636
01:11:02,663 --> 01:11:04,165
My overhead done went up

1637
01:11:04,297 --> 01:11:05,365
since the last
time I was here, man.

1638
01:11:05,499 --> 01:11:07,001
Look man, let me know.

1639
01:11:07,135 --> 01:11:08,536
Until then, I got to get on

1640
01:11:08,669 --> 01:11:10,004
out of here.
I gotta go meet Chuck

1641
01:11:10,138 --> 01:11:11,438
over off of Dinka, man.

1642
01:11:11,572 --> 01:11:13,007
I gotta get some of
that Viagra, you know?

1643
01:11:13,141 --> 01:11:15,375
My old lady, she got a promotion

1644
01:11:15,510 --> 01:11:16,911
and later tonight,

1645
01:11:17,044 --> 01:11:19,279
she gonna get a little taste
of this party favor.

1646
01:11:19,412 --> 01:11:21,314
You know what I mean?

1647
01:11:21,448 --> 01:11:23,283
Ernie, I don't gotta
think about it, man.

1648
01:11:23,416 --> 01:11:25,219
I really need this job, man.

1649
01:11:25,352 --> 01:11:26,254
Okay. Well, cool.

1650
01:11:26,386 --> 01:11:27,487
Square bills then, bro.

1651
01:11:27,622 --> 01:11:28,890
You know what?

1652
01:11:29,624 --> 01:11:31,424
I got something for you.

1653
01:11:33,528 --> 01:11:34,829
This just came in tonight.

1654
01:11:34,962 --> 01:11:37,031
You gotta serve
that reefer store

1655
01:11:37,165 --> 01:11:38,533
over there on Century.

1656
01:11:38,666 --> 01:11:39,534
The city is really
after 'em, all right?

1657
01:11:39,667 --> 01:11:40,802
It's a high priority,

1658
01:11:40,935 --> 01:11:42,469
no pun intended.

1659
01:11:42,603 --> 01:11:44,471
Listen, go down there
and play the role.

1660
01:11:44,605 --> 01:11:46,073
You know what I mean?
Be a superstar.

1661
01:11:46,207 --> 01:11:47,942
Act like you gonna buy
something when you go in there.

1662
01:11:48,075 --> 01:11:50,144
And when you buy something,
really buy something.

1663
01:11:50,278 --> 01:11:52,847
And bring me a nickel
bag of ooh wee, all right?

1664
01:11:53,714 --> 01:11:55,583
Ernie, with the
salary you paying me,

1665
01:11:55,716 --> 01:11:57,417
I ain't gonna be able
to afford nothing

1666
01:11:57,552 --> 01:11:59,452
besides the nickel
bag of stress weed.

1667
01:11:59,587 --> 01:12:01,589
Now see,
that's the attitude

1668
01:12:01,722 --> 01:12:03,558
that got your ass
written up the last time.

1669
01:12:03,691 --> 01:12:05,026
You know what I'm saying?

1670
01:12:05,159 --> 01:12:07,595
Ah, ah... I'm just fucking
with you, Ernie T.

1671
01:12:07,728 --> 01:12:09,063
Mm-hmm.

1672
01:12:09,197 --> 01:12:10,965
Dry ass sense of humor, man.
Don't let that distract you

1673
01:12:11,098 --> 01:12:13,868
from the fact that I'm actually
grateful for the opportunity.

1674
01:12:14,001 --> 01:12:17,004
All right, great,
'cause I'm distracted right now,

1675
01:12:17,138 --> 01:12:18,940
because you making
me miss my trim.

1676
01:12:19,073 --> 01:12:22,510
You're cock blocking.
You hear me? Gotta go.

1677
01:12:22,643 --> 01:12:24,645
Make sure you lock up, okay?

1678
01:12:25,213 --> 01:12:26,413
I'll lock up.

1679
01:12:27,181 --> 01:12:28,516
God damn shit, boy.

1680
01:12:28,649 --> 01:12:29,851
I'm trying to get some ass
and here you come

1681
01:12:29,984 --> 01:12:32,019
with your bullshit
"I need a job."

1682
01:12:32,153 --> 01:12:34,589
Nigga, that shit became
the neediest motherfucker.

1683
01:12:34,722 --> 01:12:36,290
How you
gonna hire the Mexicans?

1684
01:12:36,423 --> 01:12:37,658
Oh, shit.

1685
01:12:37,792 --> 01:12:39,060
The Mexicans are taking over.

1686
01:12:39,193 --> 01:12:40,895
They work
and they bring oranges.

1687
01:12:44,131 --> 01:12:45,900
- That's it.
- Right.

1688
01:12:46,033 --> 01:12:48,401
And this - all right,
that's - that's 15

1689
01:12:48,803 --> 01:12:49,704
and

1690
01:12:49,837 --> 01:12:51,371
- All right 5, 10.
- 9.

1691
01:12:51,505 --> 01:12:53,274
You want one?

1692
01:12:53,406 --> 01:12:55,209
No, I'm good.
I'm good.

1693
01:12:55,610 --> 01:12:57,377
- It's 15.
- Okay.

1694
01:12:59,814 --> 01:13:01,349
- 23. I'm out.
- 17, 18, 19...

1695
01:13:03,251 --> 01:13:04,118
Fuck!

1696
01:13:05,319 --> 01:13:06,687
You suck at this.

1697
01:13:06,821 --> 01:13:08,155
You - if we were in
Vegas playing against you,

1698
01:13:08,289 --> 01:13:10,558
I'd be a rich bitch.
At least a nigga

1699
01:13:10,691 --> 01:13:11,993
rich bitch, yeah.

1700
01:13:12,126 --> 01:13:13,928
You're gonna be
cracker rich very soon.

1701
01:13:18,498 --> 01:13:20,034
Such rude and vulgar language

1702
01:13:20,167 --> 01:13:21,636
to be using especially
in the presence

1703
01:13:21,769 --> 01:13:23,571
of the house of the Lord, man.

1704
01:13:23,738 --> 01:13:25,239
Why we gotta meet here anyway?

1705
01:13:25,373 --> 01:13:26,507
Safest place on Earth.

1706
01:13:26,641 --> 01:13:28,109
Oh. I guess your cousins

1707
01:13:28,242 --> 01:13:29,644
ain't told you about
them church bombings

1708
01:13:29,777 --> 01:13:31,646
they doing down south, huh?

1709
01:13:31,812 --> 01:13:34,215
Big Brother can't
see us here, boo.

1710
01:13:34,348 --> 01:13:35,516
But the Lord can.

1711
01:13:35,650 --> 01:13:37,218
I'm an atheist.

1712
01:13:37,385 --> 01:13:38,352
You know what?

1713
01:13:38,485 --> 01:13:40,621
That don't surprise me at all.

1714
01:13:40,755 --> 01:13:42,089
Why you gotta work
with a white boy?

1715
01:13:42,223 --> 01:13:43,658
That's my white boy.
Don't worry about it.

1716
01:13:43,791 --> 01:13:45,526
Look man, despite
your heathenness

1717
01:13:45,660 --> 01:13:47,094
and blasphemous ass ways

1718
01:13:47,228 --> 01:13:49,597
and my deep disdain
and hatred for the police,

1719
01:13:49,730 --> 01:13:51,464
I'm still gonna
give y'all this blessing.

1720
01:13:51,599 --> 01:13:52,867
Nah nigga. What this is,

1721
01:13:53,000 --> 01:13:56,203
is your janky ass
need to fuck with our

1722
01:13:56,337 --> 01:13:59,573
all powerful asses
to get something you want

1723
01:13:59,707 --> 01:14:01,676
for your own personal gain.

1724
01:14:01,809 --> 01:14:03,544
And since we incidentally happen

1725
01:14:03,678 --> 01:14:06,714
to benefit from it,
go the fuck on.

1726
01:14:06,847 --> 01:14:09,517
What the fuck ever,
you rogue fucks.

1727
01:14:09,650 --> 01:14:10,785
Now, I know y'all familiar

1728
01:14:10,918 --> 01:14:11,986
with that new
dispensary over there

1729
01:14:12,119 --> 01:14:13,287
on Century, right?

1730
01:14:13,421 --> 01:14:14,355
What about it, shit head?

1731
01:14:14,487 --> 01:14:15,756
Hey, man, fuck your mama.

1732
01:14:15,890 --> 01:14:17,325
I'm tired of this
dude right here, man.

1733
01:14:17,457 --> 01:14:18,626
I swear, man.

1734
01:14:18,759 --> 01:14:20,328
Just listen.

1735
01:14:20,493 --> 01:14:21,762
Now, I got this
fat bitch, right.

1736
01:14:21,896 --> 01:14:23,331
I be using her mouth
from time to time.

1737
01:14:23,463 --> 01:14:26,400
She real cool. She a
budtender down at that spot.

1738
01:14:26,534 --> 01:14:28,569
She be kushing me down,
necking me down,

1739
01:14:28,703 --> 01:14:30,137
like all command, you feel me.

1740
01:14:30,271 --> 01:14:32,340
'Til she got fired
for stealing shit, right.

1741
01:14:32,472 --> 01:14:35,609
But anyway, last night,
she was just handling my shit.

1742
01:14:35,743 --> 01:14:37,645
She was blowing
my shit to oblivion.

1743
01:14:37,778 --> 01:14:40,114
She was giving me like
the Olympic rim.

1744
01:14:40,247 --> 01:14:42,149
She was just handling
a nigga's shit like real,

1745
01:14:42,283 --> 01:14:43,651
She got the little
- Nigga, just skip

1746
01:14:43,784 --> 01:14:45,353
the dick sucking dramatizations

1747
01:14:45,485 --> 01:14:46,587
and get to the real.

1748
01:14:46,721 --> 01:14:47,688
You know what, you a hater.

1749
01:14:47,822 --> 01:14:49,590
He wanted to hear that shit.

1750
01:14:49,724 --> 01:14:51,491
Anyway,

1751
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,893
all right, all right, so look.

1752
01:14:53,027 --> 01:14:54,128
She told me that
every Tuesday night

1753
01:14:54,261 --> 01:14:57,398
at 7:00 PM,
this is cash drop night.

1754
01:14:57,531 --> 01:15:00,468
They got one security guard
that worked that day.

1755
01:15:00,601 --> 01:15:01,902
Just one.

1756
01:15:02,770 --> 01:15:04,505
The other leaves at six o'clock.

1757
01:15:08,909 --> 01:15:09,577
Ooh!

1758
01:15:11,612 --> 01:15:12,847
Hey!

1759
01:15:13,614 --> 01:15:14,949
Ooh!

1760
01:15:15,082 --> 01:15:16,484
He oversees
the cash drop

1761
01:15:19,787 --> 01:15:20,688
and the dope drop.

1762
01:15:36,203 --> 01:15:37,506
That's right, nigga.

1763
01:15:37,638 --> 01:15:39,673
Crystal meth.

1764
01:15:44,812 --> 01:15:46,580
Ice, ice, nigga.

1765
01:15:48,482 --> 01:15:49,717
By the pounds, I'm told.

1766
01:15:58,459 --> 01:15:59,727
Now, if you two cowboys

1767
01:15:59,860 --> 01:16:01,162
really wanna make
some serious bread,

1768
01:16:01,295 --> 01:16:02,963
you go shake down
them equally crooked fucks

1769
01:16:03,097 --> 01:16:05,766
and bring me back an ass load
of that premium dope.

1770
01:16:05,900 --> 01:16:06,700
All that shit.

1771
01:16:22,283 --> 01:16:23,751
Yeah,
you know I need that

1772
01:16:23,884 --> 01:16:25,753
for these chalkies up north.
You feel me?

1773
01:16:25,886 --> 01:16:27,154
And you sure they moving

1774
01:16:27,288 --> 01:16:28,789
that kind of weight
out of that dispensary?

1775
01:16:28,923 --> 01:16:30,825
Yeah.
Yeah. I - I'm pretty sure.

1776
01:16:30,958 --> 01:16:32,493
- Oh, fuck!
- Don't be fucking with us,

1777
01:16:32,660 --> 01:16:34,161
thug.

1778
01:16:34,295 --> 01:16:36,097
Hey, man, ain't nobody got time
to be fucking around, pork chop.

1779
01:16:36,230 --> 01:16:37,498
Go home and play
with your sister

1780
01:16:37,631 --> 01:16:39,200
if you think I'm playing, fool.

1781
01:16:39,333 --> 01:16:40,835
Yeah. I feel like
something funny

1782
01:16:40,968 --> 01:16:42,369
was coming up
out of that spot.

1783
01:16:42,503 --> 01:16:44,705
Niggas was gonna be illegal
one way or another.

1784
01:16:44,839 --> 01:16:46,006
Probably working as distro

1785
01:16:46,140 --> 01:16:47,608
for somebody
south of the border.

1786
01:16:47,741 --> 01:16:48,742
I don't give a fuck
who they're working for.

1787
01:16:48,876 --> 01:16:50,144
It's tax season.

1788
01:16:51,712 --> 01:16:53,347
Tax season's in the
summertime too?

1789
01:16:53,481 --> 01:16:54,615
You is a stupid motherfucker.

1790
01:16:54,748 --> 01:16:56,016
I didn't
even know that,

1791
01:16:56,150 --> 01:16:57,952
'cause I ain't never
had taxes, right.

1792
01:16:58,085 --> 01:16:59,687
'Cause I get most of my money
under the table, you feel me?

1793
01:16:59,820 --> 01:17:01,622
I know how to butter
my bread on the low.

1794
01:17:01,755 --> 01:17:03,357
You know what I'm talking about?

1795
01:17:03,491 --> 01:17:04,758
- I'll be out here...
- You ignorant ass nigga.

1796
01:17:05,392 --> 01:17:07,828
Tax season is year round
in South Central,

1797
01:17:07,962 --> 01:17:12,867
so go get me my cheddar,
you stupid ass hood rat bitch.

1798
01:17:13,000 --> 01:17:15,469
Well, I rather be Mighty Mouse
than Porky Pig,

1799
01:17:15,604 --> 01:17:17,606
you rampart reject
motherfuckers.

1800
01:17:17,872 --> 01:17:19,340
Love these motherfuckers, man.

1801
01:17:19,608 --> 01:17:21,909
Hell yeah. That shit's hot.

1802
01:17:22,042 --> 01:17:23,377
Nah man. You know,
when I was a kid

1803
01:17:23,512 --> 01:17:25,646
and you knock 'em
down in one bite.

1804
01:17:25,880 --> 01:17:26,780
Man, look at this shit.

1805
01:17:31,586 --> 01:17:32,820
Howdy.

1806
01:17:32,953 --> 01:17:34,121
You good folks look
like you're a part

1807
01:17:34,255 --> 01:17:35,890
of the neighborhood
watch program.

1808
01:17:39,193 --> 01:17:40,161
Yeah.

1809
01:17:40,761 --> 01:17:41,795
Something like that.

1810
01:17:45,266 --> 01:17:46,535
Okay, um...

1811
01:17:46,901 --> 01:17:48,469
we're here for the open house.

1812
01:17:50,639 --> 01:17:51,839
House closed.

1813
01:17:52,039 --> 01:17:53,307
What do you mean?

1814
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,808
- We drove all the way from...
- Well,

1815
01:17:54,942 --> 01:17:56,143
Sounds like

1816
01:17:56,277 --> 01:17:58,946
you need to drive
all the way back.

1817
01:17:59,079 --> 01:18:01,115
This house is off the market.

1818
01:18:01,516 --> 01:18:03,217
Oh. Okay, uh...

1819
01:18:04,051 --> 01:18:05,686
guess we're a little too late.

1820
01:18:05,853 --> 01:18:07,087
Let's go, honey.

1821
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:09,924
Nope.

1822
01:18:10,057 --> 01:18:11,058
Not too late,
just too white.

1823
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:17,666
Courtesy of your neighborhood
negro protection agency.

1824
01:18:17,798 --> 01:18:18,799
Motherfuckers.

1825
01:18:20,000 --> 01:18:21,536
I'm tired of these things, man.

1826
01:18:23,971 --> 01:18:26,040
See, that's more like it.

1827
01:18:27,141 --> 01:18:29,743
How are you, my
Nubian brother and sister?

1828
01:18:30,044 --> 01:18:31,245
Uh, good, and yourself?

1829
01:18:31,378 --> 01:18:32,581
Even better if we
could come on in

1830
01:18:32,713 --> 01:18:33,582
and see this house.

1831
01:18:33,714 --> 01:18:34,949
Oh, well, absolutely.

1832
01:18:35,082 --> 01:18:37,619
Absolutely.
And just so you know,

1833
01:18:37,751 --> 01:18:40,589
the owner,
very eager to sell.

1834
01:18:40,721 --> 01:18:41,922
Wow, that's pretty encouraging.

1835
01:18:47,696 --> 01:18:48,896
To somebody like you.

1836
01:18:54,235 --> 01:18:56,571
Man, God damn!
Is you ready, nigga?

1837
01:18:56,804 --> 01:18:57,938
Yeah, nigga, I'm ready.

1838
01:18:58,806 --> 01:19:01,509
I can't believe we finna hear
this genius at work.

1839
01:19:01,643 --> 01:19:03,010
Hey, this my nigga.

1840
01:19:03,143 --> 01:19:05,846
Man, at least I got
aspirations, motherfucker.

1841
01:19:05,980 --> 01:19:07,381
The fuck you aspire to do?

1842
01:19:07,515 --> 01:19:09,883
Nigga, I aspire to fuck
with you, you dummy.

1843
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:12,386
Now, that's a dangerous
job, motherfucker.

1844
01:19:12,520 --> 01:19:14,388
Say man,
time is money, man.

1845
01:19:14,522 --> 01:19:16,390
And judging from the looks
of y'all impoverished faces,

1846
01:19:16,524 --> 01:19:17,758

niggas got enough,

1847
01:19:17,891 --> 01:19:19,360
so let's get to it, man.

1848
01:19:19,493 --> 01:19:21,929
Look, just make sure you got me
sounding right, homeboy.

1849
01:19:22,062 --> 01:19:24,064
Nah, you make sure you
sound all right, homeboy.

1850
01:19:24,198 --> 01:19:25,533
Yeah, all right. Let's go

1851
01:19:25,667 --> 01:19:26,934
All right,
let's get to it, man.

1852
01:19:27,067 --> 01:19:28,369
From the top.

1853
01:19:47,321 --> 01:19:48,188
Ooh! Man,
my nigga been in there

1854
01:19:48,322 --> 01:19:49,356

1855
01:19:49,490 --> 01:19:51,859
and that nigga got
the booth on fire!

1856
01:19:51,992 --> 01:19:53,494
And look at him.

1857
01:19:53,628 --> 01:19:57,398
That's my dawg. Ooh, that
nigga spitting bars, nigga.

1858
01:19:57,532 --> 01:19:59,099
- Hot boy.
- Fuck, man!

1859
01:19:59,233 --> 01:20:01,135
Bro, you

1860
01:20:01,268 --> 01:20:04,438

RadioShack equipment, man.

1861
01:20:04,572 --> 01:20:06,940
Man, y'all unappreciative
asses gotta go, bro.

1862
01:20:07,074 --> 01:20:08,909
Not like y'all bringing
no bread up in here, man.

1863
01:20:09,043 --> 01:20:10,244
I'm tired of producing
for niggas like you

1864
01:20:10,377 --> 01:20:12,179
for some motherfucking
beer money, bro.

1865
01:20:12,313 --> 01:20:13,914
Not like you poppin' 'cause you
got your little laptop in here.

1866
01:20:14,048 --> 01:20:15,650
Man, that don't
mean shit to me, bro.

1867
01:20:16,083 --> 01:20:17,786
Shit, man.

1868
01:20:17,918 --> 01:20:19,386
Nigga gotta get some money, bro.

1869
01:20:19,521 --> 01:20:21,556
This shit ain't never
gonna crack, man.

1870
01:20:21,955 --> 01:20:24,592
Hey, man, hell yeah, man.
You ain't the only one, nigga.

1871
01:20:24,726 --> 01:20:27,161
I got another fucking baby
on the way, nigga.

1872
01:20:27,294 --> 01:20:30,097
My job ain't about shit, nigga.
And my dream job,

1873
01:20:30,230 --> 01:20:31,800
that motherfucker
got a force field

1874
01:20:31,932 --> 01:20:32,966
around the bitch.

1875
01:20:33,100 --> 01:20:34,602
Man, we gotta hit a lick, bro.

1876
01:20:34,736 --> 01:20:37,938
Not no petty Eddie
smalltime shit, neither.

1877
01:20:38,138 --> 01:20:40,207
Nigga, I'm down to hit a bank.

1878
01:20:40,742 --> 01:20:41,942
A bank?

1879
01:20:42,076 --> 01:20:43,578
Man, you sound just like

1880
01:20:43,712 --> 01:20:45,913
one of them old ass
niggas from the '90s.

1881
01:20:46,046 --> 01:20:47,848
Man, ain't nobody
hitting banks no more.

1882
01:20:48,248 --> 01:20:50,819
It's a one way trip
to the Feds, bro.

1883
01:20:51,118 --> 01:20:52,821
You still hitting that pipe?

1884
01:20:52,953 --> 01:20:54,088
'Cause your idea's sounding

1885
01:20:54,221 --> 01:20:57,157
just like you,
bullshit.

1886
01:20:57,291 --> 01:20:58,959
Bro Bosco, chill, bro.

1887
01:20:59,093 --> 01:21:00,795
The nigga might be
half right this time, bro.

1888
01:21:00,928 --> 01:21:03,997
Yeah, I'm right. The OG Bosco,
nigga. What you talk about

1889
01:21:04,131 --> 01:21:05,099
- Little homie?
- Yeah, all right.

1890
01:21:05,232 --> 01:21:07,334
Nah, real nigga shit, bro.

1891
01:21:08,068 --> 01:21:10,605
I know that dispensary
out on Century.

1892
01:21:10,739 --> 01:21:12,640
That motherfucker got
more than kush in it.

1893
01:21:12,774 --> 01:21:15,677
I slid through there last week
and peeped the whole thing.

1894
01:21:15,810 --> 01:21:17,612
They got meth, crack, powder,

1895
01:21:17,746 --> 01:21:19,814

Big racks in the back.

1896
01:21:19,947 --> 01:21:21,181
I seen everything, bro.

1897
01:21:21,315 --> 01:21:22,983
Oh shit, man.

01:21:23,117 --> 01:21:24,251
none of this, man.

1899
01:21:24,385 --> 01:21:25,653
Unless y'all finna
cut me in, bro,

1900
01:21:25,787 --> 01:21:26,954
without me having
to get my hands dirty,

1901
01:21:27,087 --> 01:21:28,523
I am not fuck with y'all, bro.

1902
01:21:28,656 --> 01:21:31,024
Man, shut your
delicate ass up, man.

1903
01:21:31,793 --> 01:21:35,129
Hey, I think I know those folks

01:21:35,262 --> 01:21:38,666
You know them folks, man
Fuck them and fuck you too, bro.

1905
01:21:38,800 --> 01:21:39,933

and that's on gangsters, nigga.

1908
01:21:43,538 --> 01:21:45,005
Bosco, nigga.

1909
01:21:45,205 --> 01:21:46,306
Hey, hey, hey.

1910
01:21:46,440 --> 01:21:48,242
Disclaimer though,

and I can't do it my, nigga.

1914

01:21:59,019 --> 01:22:00,020
and I'll be damned

1917
01:22:01,589 --> 01:22:04,024
Man, I knew you
was a wet pussy, bro.

1918
01:22:04,158 --> 01:22:06,360
And don't you still
owe me something, nigga?

1919
01:22:06,493 --> 01:22:07,529
Three stacks.

1920
01:22:07,662 --> 01:22:09,163
From that non-refundable
bond fee.

1921
01:22:09,296 --> 01:22:11,131
Yeah, remember that, right?

1922
01:22:11,866 --> 01:22:12,767
But look my nigga,

01:22:13,601 --> 01:22:15,804

1924
01:22:16,571 --> 01:22:18,439
With all the shit that they

1929
01:22:26,748 --> 01:22:29,183
in that motherfucker,
while you direct traffic.

1930
01:22:30,718 --> 01:22:32,720
But go on and spy

1931
01:22:32,854 --> 01:22:34,054

1932
01:22:34,789 --> 01:22:35,924
Anyway bro,

01:22:36,056 --> 01:22:37,525
I slid down there last week.

1934
01:22:37,659 --> 01:22:39,293
I was supposed to serve them
they business papers.

1935
01:22:39,426 --> 01:22:41,962
Obviously the city
is on them negroes, bro.

1936
01:22:42,229 --> 01:22:43,363
They popping.

1937
01:22:43,698 --> 01:22:44,933
But I couldn't serve
'em the papers,

1938
01:22:45,065 --> 01:22:46,099
'cause they had some big ass

1939
01:22:46,233 --> 01:22:47,602
goodfellow meeting in the back.

1940
01:22:47,735 --> 01:22:50,003
That's when I seen
it all go down, bro.

1941
01:22:50,337 --> 01:22:52,707
Hundreds of thousands
of dollars, my nigga.

1942
01:22:52,841 --> 01:22:53,808
Real shit.

1943
01:22:53,942 --> 01:22:55,175
Big dope.

1944
01:22:55,910 --> 01:22:56,911
Damn!

1945
01:22:57,645 --> 01:22:58,913
Who would've known
them ugly ass niggas

1946
01:22:59,046 --> 01:23:00,515
was getting it like that.

1947
01:23:00,648 --> 01:23:01,950
We 'bout it?

1948
01:23:02,216 --> 01:23:04,017
Hey, hey, for real, bro.

1949
01:23:04,218 --> 01:23:06,186
I ain't never been on
no hardcore gangster shit

1950
01:23:06,320 --> 01:23:08,121
like you niggas, bro.

1951
01:23:08,255 --> 01:23:10,758
But right now,
I'm thirsty, my nigga.

1952
01:23:10,892 --> 01:23:13,695
Desperate time's call for
desperate measures, my nigga.

1953
01:23:13,828 --> 01:23:14,796
And I need this, my nigga.

1954
01:23:14,929 --> 01:23:16,096
Are you niggas with this shit?

1955
01:23:16,230 --> 01:23:17,632
Hell yeah.

1956
01:23:17,765 --> 01:23:18,867
- Fo' sure.
- Man, you make sure

1957
01:23:18,999 --> 01:23:19,834
you got your head on right

1958
01:23:19,968 --> 01:23:21,034
for this, homeboy.

1959
01:23:22,570 --> 01:23:23,605
Nigga, I'm good.

1960
01:23:25,105 --> 01:23:26,340
Tone,

1961
01:23:27,575 --> 01:23:28,610
you good?

1962
01:23:28,977 --> 01:23:30,545
Hell no, I ain't with it, man.

1963
01:23:30,678 --> 01:23:32,012
I ain't on no Tupac shit

1964
01:23:32,145 --> 01:23:33,648
like y'all niggas is, man.
I'll pray for y'all though.

1965
01:23:33,781 --> 01:23:36,216
Yeah, I knew you was
a scary fat ass nigga.

1966
01:23:36,350 --> 01:23:37,685
Hey man, fuck all
y'all niggas, man.

1967
01:23:37,819 --> 01:23:39,888
If y'all get caught,
I don't know nothing,

1968
01:23:40,020 --> 01:23:41,789
but if y'all get away with it,
just remember who was there

1969
01:23:41,923 --> 01:23:43,257
with y'all niggas in spirit.
You feel me?

1970
01:23:54,969 --> 01:23:56,871
Oh fuck! Oh!

1971
01:23:57,005 --> 01:23:58,105
Ooh, God damn.

1972
01:23:59,406 --> 01:24:00,875
Ah, shit!

1973
01:24:03,277 --> 01:24:04,779
Oh!

1974
01:24:04,913 --> 01:24:06,113
Damn, Alesia.

1975
01:24:06,246 --> 01:24:07,314
Every time I...

1976
01:24:07,849 --> 01:24:09,884
try to wean myself off
that good, good,

1977
01:24:10,018 --> 01:24:11,151
you just come back in here

1978
01:24:11,285 --> 01:24:13,153
and throw that shit
on my weak ass.

1979
01:24:14,022 --> 01:24:15,557
Fuck!

1980
01:24:15,690 --> 01:24:17,559
I knew I should have hired
your ugly ass cousin Tameka.

1981
01:24:19,493 --> 01:24:21,194
You knew what you were doing,

1982
01:24:21,328 --> 01:24:22,396
'cause I was always the best

1983
01:24:22,530 --> 01:24:24,097
candidate for the job.

1984
01:24:25,533 --> 01:24:28,402
Can nobody take dick-

1985
01:24:29,369 --> 01:24:30,672
-tation like me.

1986
01:24:32,674 --> 01:24:33,741
But remember,

1987
01:24:33,875 --> 01:24:35,944
too much of anything
can be dangerous.

1988
01:24:36,076 --> 01:24:38,245
Speaking of that, we need to
change the dress code

1989
01:24:38,378 --> 01:24:39,581
around here, okay.

1990
01:24:39,714 --> 01:24:41,481
This shit is hazardous
for my marriage,

1991
01:24:41,616 --> 01:24:42,750
my whole sanity.

1992
01:24:42,884 --> 01:24:44,351
Look, don't you have
any like turtlenecks,

1993
01:24:44,484 --> 01:24:46,821
a - any rompers in
your wardrobe anywhere?

1994
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:48,155
Come on, try to help me out.

1995
01:24:48,288 --> 01:24:49,456
Mm, but it's July
in South Central.

1996
01:24:49,591 --> 01:24:50,992
Okay, but I - I need
you to dress

1997
01:24:51,124 --> 01:24:52,860
like it's December in Chicago.

1998
01:24:52,994 --> 01:24:54,494
Can you maybe do that for me?

1999
01:24:55,195 --> 01:24:57,164
Please, try.

2000
01:24:58,131 --> 01:24:59,567
I'll do my best.

2001
01:25:00,334 --> 01:25:01,603
Thank you.

2002
01:25:02,235 --> 01:25:03,871
But is there anything

2003
01:25:04,005 --> 01:25:06,173
else that you need me to do?

2004
01:25:06,306 --> 01:25:08,141
Nope, nope, nope, nope,
nope, nope.

2005
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:09,944
Hey, Alesia, I'm good.

2006
01:25:10,078 --> 01:25:11,111
Now I - I appreciate you.

2007
01:25:11,244 --> 01:25:12,547
I appreciate.

2008
01:25:12,680 --> 01:25:14,147
- Okay.
- Okay, I think

2009
01:25:14,281 --> 01:25:15,182
I appreciate everything
you do around here.

2010
01:25:16,584 --> 01:25:17,484
All right? Um...

2011
01:25:17,619 --> 01:25:18,586
How 'bout you...um...

2012
01:25:19,353 --> 01:25:20,253
Won't you go and take,

2013
01:25:20,387 --> 01:25:22,724
like, a long lunch. Okay?

2014
01:25:23,123 --> 01:25:24,092
You know, take your time.

2015
01:25:24,224 --> 01:25:25,526
And um,

2016
01:25:25,660 --> 01:25:27,227
yeah, I'm just gonna
focus on some work here.

2017
01:25:28,096 --> 01:25:29,262
There you go.

2018
01:25:29,396 --> 01:25:30,665
Um, I'll focus on the work here

2019
01:25:30,798 --> 01:25:31,966
- Just alone.
- Okay.

2020
01:25:32,100 --> 01:25:33,067
That'd be good for me.

2021
01:25:33,200 --> 01:25:34,569
Ah!

2022
01:25:51,218 --> 01:25:52,219
Fuck!

2023
01:26:02,396 --> 01:26:03,631
Ah, shit!

2024
01:26:09,070 --> 01:26:10,203
I said
alone,

2025
01:26:10,337 --> 01:26:12,239
Alesia.

2026
01:26:12,372 --> 01:26:14,274
What's
the matter, Randall?

2027
01:26:14,408 --> 01:26:16,911
You too busy serving your secret

2028
01:26:17,045 --> 01:26:18,713
that you can't serve the people?

2029
01:26:18,846 --> 01:26:20,715
Man, it ain't even lunch time

2030
01:26:20,848 --> 01:26:21,783
and your secretary

2031
01:26:21,916 --> 01:26:24,317
is two buttons
down on her shirt.

2032
01:26:25,419 --> 01:26:26,654
One way or the other,

2033
01:26:27,421 --> 01:26:29,489
she's sucking at her job, huh?

2034
01:26:30,158 --> 01:26:31,491
Do you even have
an appointment?

2035
01:26:31,626 --> 01:26:33,127
You can't just be barging

2036
01:26:33,260 --> 01:26:34,629
into the mayor's office.

2037
01:26:34,762 --> 01:26:36,463
Come on, Randall,
you ain't no real leader.

2038
01:26:36,597 --> 01:26:39,399
You just another elected
opportunist, like the rest of

2039
01:26:39,534 --> 01:26:42,402
those power
hungry cracker fucks.

2040
01:26:42,537 --> 01:26:44,072
Thank you, Frederick Douglass.

2041
01:26:44,204 --> 01:26:47,474
How about you sit down and
just state your business, Jack.

2042
01:26:48,609 --> 01:26:50,778
No, that's okay.
I'll stand.

2043
01:26:51,244 --> 01:26:53,246
I don't wanna
stoop to your level.

2044
01:26:53,548 --> 01:26:55,583
Well, do your thing, negro.

2045
01:26:57,085 --> 01:26:58,351
Cutting to the chase.

2046
01:26:58,619 --> 01:26:59,921
So I'm gonna assume

2047
01:27:00,054 --> 01:27:01,089
that you are in receipt

2048
01:27:01,221 --> 01:27:02,523
of those photography elements

2049
01:27:02,657 --> 01:27:04,357
sent to your residence.

2050
01:27:10,098 --> 01:27:11,364
That's you?

2051
01:27:11,498 --> 01:27:13,266
You sent a fucking bullet

2052
01:27:13,400 --> 01:27:14,434
to my house?

2053
01:27:14,569 --> 01:27:16,336
You got a little nasty ass habit

2054
01:27:16,470 --> 01:27:18,072
of sticking your big ass nose

2055
01:27:18,206 --> 01:27:20,174
where it don't belong, Ron.

2056
01:27:20,307 --> 01:27:22,176
Well, if it goes down

2057
01:27:22,309 --> 01:27:24,244
in the city of South Central,

2058
01:27:24,377 --> 01:27:26,147
this big ass nose,

2059
01:27:26,279 --> 01:27:27,582
is gonna find it,

2060
01:27:27,715 --> 01:27:30,218
just like it found
your greasy ass palms

2061
01:27:30,350 --> 01:27:32,553
dipping into that
cock-a-zoid cookie jar.

2062
01:27:32,687 --> 01:27:35,056
Yeah, I thought that take some
of the bass out your voice.

2063
01:27:35,189 --> 01:27:36,157
You was bubbling up on me

2064
01:27:36,289 --> 01:27:37,257
like a fried bologna sandwich

2065
01:27:37,390 --> 01:27:38,693
a second ago.

2066
01:27:38,826 --> 01:27:39,560
All right, so...

2067
01:27:39,694 --> 01:27:42,130
so get on with it, Sundown.

2068
01:27:42,429 --> 01:27:43,898
Or is it Shakedown today?

2069
01:27:44,031 --> 01:27:45,465
You know what?
That's funny, motherfucker,

2070
01:27:45,600 --> 01:27:47,235
coming from a nigga
who on a take.

2071
01:27:47,367 --> 01:27:48,368
You ain't finna to sell out

2072
01:27:48,502 --> 01:27:50,037
the city on my watch, bruh.

2073
01:27:50,171 --> 01:27:52,006
It ain't even like that.
You got the whole damn thing

2074
01:27:52,140 --> 01:27:53,541
turned around, man.

2075
01:27:54,142 --> 01:27:55,408
Man, you must think I got off

2076
01:27:55,543 --> 01:27:58,378
a Greyhound from
Little Rock yesterday.

2077
01:27:59,147 --> 01:28:00,848
Check this out, partner.

2078
01:28:03,483 --> 01:28:05,820
That white boy you've
been meetin' with

2079
01:28:05,953 --> 01:28:07,188
is not a lobbyist.

2080
01:28:07,320 --> 01:28:08,421
He's a Fed.

2081
01:28:08,556 --> 01:28:10,124
And he's a threat to you

2082
01:28:10,258 --> 01:28:11,526
and the city.

2083
01:28:12,492 --> 01:28:16,130
And we must
eliminate that threat.

2084
01:28:16,931 --> 01:28:19,366
Barnett, the guy I golf with

2085
01:28:19,499 --> 01:28:20,500
is a Fed?

2086
01:28:20,635 --> 01:28:21,903
That's right.

2087
01:28:22,036 --> 01:28:23,971
An official sitting by
the federal government.

2088
01:28:24,105 --> 01:28:25,405
- Shi...
- Yes.

2089
01:28:25,540 --> 01:28:26,507
Come on, man.

2090
01:28:26,641 --> 01:28:28,308
Listen, South Central

2091
01:28:28,441 --> 01:28:31,179
is the main artery
of Los Angeles.

2092
01:28:32,213 --> 01:28:35,550
It runs through the
middle of everything.

2093
01:28:36,449 --> 01:28:37,484
Minutes from Hollywood

2094
01:28:37,618 --> 01:28:39,419
to beaches downtown.

2095
01:28:39,554 --> 01:28:43,456
This is a geographical
prime location.

2096
01:28:44,225 --> 01:28:45,660
And them honkeys want it.

2097
01:28:46,459 --> 01:28:48,529
Now, they done stole
the whole country.

2098
01:28:48,696 --> 01:28:51,065
Now you think they got
reservations about snatching up

2099
01:28:51,199 --> 01:28:52,266
this little piece of land

2100
01:28:52,399 --> 01:28:53,668
for a few dollars?

2101
01:28:56,436 --> 01:28:57,638
All right, man.

2102
01:28:57,772 --> 01:28:59,507
Tell me what the
fuck you gonna do.

2103
01:28:59,740 --> 01:29:02,043
You gonna kill a federal agent?

2104
01:29:03,177 --> 01:29:04,312
No,

2105
01:29:04,444 --> 01:29:05,680
I'm not...

2106
01:29:07,380 --> 01:29:08,549
but you are.

2107
01:29:09,584 --> 01:29:11,319
Wait, what?

2108
01:29:11,451 --> 01:29:12,987
The fuck you talking about, man?

2109
01:29:13,120 --> 01:29:15,156
- Hmm.
- I can't kill him.

2110
01:29:15,723 --> 01:29:17,457
I'm the fucking mayor.

2111
01:29:17,592 --> 01:29:18,458
If you don't,

2112
01:29:18,593 --> 01:29:19,794
you'll be an inmate.

2113
01:29:20,493 --> 01:29:22,830
Now, I have copies
of those pictures.

2114
01:29:23,631 --> 01:29:25,566
You either kill the Fed

2115
01:29:26,601 --> 01:29:28,703
or do time in the feds.

2116
01:29:30,403 --> 01:29:31,772
You ain't even kidding.

2117
01:29:33,341 --> 01:29:34,542
How...

2118
01:29:36,010 --> 01:29:37,178
How the he...

2119
01:29:37,311 --> 01:29:38,846
How the hell would I even
do something like that?

2120
01:29:40,848 --> 01:29:41,682
Hold up, man. Check it out.

2121
01:29:41,816 --> 01:29:42,650
Don't worry about it.

2122
01:29:42,783 --> 01:29:43,918
Don't worry about it.

2123
01:29:44,619 --> 01:29:46,854
I got you, okay.

2124
01:29:47,588 --> 01:29:50,258
Cut and manufactured

2125
01:29:50,390 --> 01:29:51,359
in South Central.

2126
01:29:51,491 --> 01:29:52,392
Look, check it out.

2127
01:29:52,526 --> 01:29:54,262
No numbers on it,

2128
01:29:54,427 --> 01:29:55,529
clean as they come.

2129
01:29:56,831 --> 01:29:58,398
You can't
be fucking serious.

2130
01:29:58,532 --> 01:29:59,466
Ron...

2131
01:29:59,600 --> 01:30:02,370
Ron, you're out of your fucking

2132
01:30:02,536 --> 01:30:03,771
You're fucking bugging out.

2133
01:30:03,905 --> 01:30:04,839
Look hey,
come on, Randall,

2134
01:30:04,972 --> 01:30:06,340
quit with the tough guy act.

2135
01:30:06,473 --> 01:30:07,375
Now we both
know you just as soft

2136
01:30:07,508 --> 01:30:09,010
as wet toilet paper, okay?

2137
01:30:10,511 --> 01:30:11,679
Listen,

2138
01:30:11,812 --> 01:30:13,581
but you can do this.

2139
01:30:14,081 --> 01:30:15,116
Okay?

2140
01:30:15,249 --> 01:30:16,984
If you janky enough
to turn your back

2141
01:30:17,118 --> 01:30:19,520
on the city you grew up in,
then you certainly got it in you

2142
01:30:19,654 --> 01:30:21,689
to smoke this piece of shit.

2143
01:30:22,890 --> 01:30:24,125
Now it has to be done

2144
01:30:24,258 --> 01:30:26,060
before the next
city council meeting.

2145
01:30:26,193 --> 01:30:28,729
And I'm fully aware
of what's at stake.

2146
01:30:29,496 --> 01:30:32,432
Yeah, that's the big voting day.

2147
01:30:36,404 --> 01:30:37,672
Wait, you...

2148
01:30:37,805 --> 01:30:39,340
You're fucking coming
at me sideways

2149
01:30:39,472 --> 01:30:41,943

Nat Turner shit.

2150
01:30:43,344 --> 01:30:44,211
Fuck, man!

2151
01:30:44,345 --> 01:30:46,247
Hey, hey, hey.

2152
01:30:46,380 --> 01:30:47,415
It's for the greater good

2153
01:30:47,548 --> 01:30:48,916
of South Central.

2154
01:30:50,284 --> 01:30:51,052
Oh,

2155
01:30:52,286 --> 01:30:54,155

2156
01:30:54,288 --> 01:30:55,189
partner.

2157
01:31:53,547 --> 01:31:54,749

2163
01:32:03,424 --> 01:32:04,492

01:32:10,664 --> 01:32:13,067
Ooh, this is my song.

2167
01:32:14,602 --> 01:32:15,703
Uh!

2168
01:32:19,340 --> 01:32:20,608
Shake that little shit,
but don't break it, girl.

2169
01:32:20,741 --> 01:32:22,543
You know you slim.

2170
01:32:22,743 --> 01:32:23,944
I need that ass intact

2171
01:32:24,078 --> 01:32:25,514
for when I come
back from this run.

2172
01:32:25,646 --> 01:32:27,415
We about to turn up tonight.

2173
01:32:27,548 --> 01:32:28,416
- Hey!
- Ah!

2174
01:32:28,549 --> 01:32:29,784

2179
01:32:35,356 --> 01:32:37,992
I can't wait to make a
pretzel out of you bitches.

2180
01:32:38,125 --> 01:32:39,326
Nigga, hell no.

2181
01:32:39,460 --> 01:32:40,928
I don't share my meat.
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2182
01:32:41,062 --> 01:32:42,696
Why you gotta get
all serious and shit.

2183
01:32:42,830 --> 01:32:44,732
We over here
being festive, girl.

2184
01:32:44,865 --> 01:32:45,833
You know how I get

2185
01:32:45,966 --> 01:32:47,668
when I get off that sip.

2186
01:32:48,035 --> 01:32:49,804
I just recently stopped
calling my mama

2187
01:32:49,937 --> 01:32:51,605
on that drunk
repressed feeling shit

2188
01:32:51,739 --> 01:32:52,606
nobody care about.

2189
01:32:52,740 --> 01:32:54,041
Yeah, whatever.

2190
01:32:54,708 --> 01:32:56,143
But what's happening though?

2191
01:32:56,277 --> 01:32:57,546
You gonna take this ride up
north with me or what?

2192
01:32:57,678 --> 01:32:59,280
I ain't got no babysitter.

2193
01:33:00,781 --> 01:33:02,049
Take the little
crumb jacker with us.

2194
01:33:03,552 --> 01:33:05,219
Yeah, maybe.

2195
01:33:05,352 --> 01:33:06,587
But we gonna need
some more of these

2196
01:33:06,720 --> 01:33:07,988
before the night is up.

2197
01:33:08,722 --> 01:33:10,559
My nerves just be fucked up

2198
01:33:10,691 --> 01:33:12,093
off long trips.

2199
01:33:12,226 --> 01:33:13,894
It just remind me of when
I used to visit my dad

2200
01:33:14,028 --> 01:33:16,197
in prison in San Luis Obispo.

2201
01:33:16,330 --> 01:33:19,133
Long-ass trips for
that ain't shit nigga.

2202
01:33:22,069 --> 01:33:23,137
You expecting company?

2203
01:33:23,270 --> 01:33:24,672
Hell no.

2204
01:33:25,840 --> 01:33:27,542
Oh. It's probably him.

2205
01:33:27,675 --> 01:33:28,976
Where the mustard at?

2206
01:33:29,110 --> 01:33:30,010
I ain't playing with you.

2207
01:33:30,144 --> 01:33:31,312
Shut up.

2208
01:33:31,445 --> 01:33:32,480
Tasha?

2209
01:33:32,613 --> 01:33:33,814
Shit! It's Donald.
Fuck!

2210
01:33:33,948 --> 01:33:35,216
Man, sit yo' ass down.

2211
01:33:35,349 --> 01:33:36,784
Ain't nobody tell
you to get excited.

2212
01:33:36,917 --> 01:33:38,486
Get out of grown
people business.

2213
01:33:38,619 --> 01:33:40,154
I forgot he was
coming to get Kayla.

2214
01:33:40,287 --> 01:33:41,922
Man, fuck
that old busta ass nigga.

2215
01:33:42,056 --> 01:33:44,191
Let him come get his liability
and get the fuck off.

2216
01:33:44,325 --> 01:33:46,093
Okay, but what
about all of that?

2217
01:33:46,227 --> 01:33:48,295
Now all of a sudden you wanna
start acting timid and shit.

2218
01:33:48,429 --> 01:33:50,264
I don't give a fuck
about that nigga.

2219
01:33:50,397 --> 01:33:52,900
Shit, man, that motherfucker
ain't got shit on the cable bill

2220
01:33:53,033 --> 01:33:54,635
let alone the God damn rent,

2221
01:33:54,768 --> 01:33:56,337
so he ain't got no opinion

2222
01:33:56,470 --> 01:33:57,572
in this motherfucker.

2223
01:33:57,705 --> 01:33:58,806
Do you understand
what I'm saying?

2224
01:33:58,939 --> 01:33:59,874
So just let the
nigga get his baby

2225
01:34:00,007 --> 01:34:01,108
and come on back,

2226
01:34:01,242 --> 01:34:02,611
'cause we got
business to handle.

2227
01:34:02,743 --> 01:34:03,644
All you motherfuckers

2228
01:34:03,777 --> 01:34:04,912

2229
01:34:05,045 --> 01:34:06,013

Tasha, what the fuck?

01:34:07,715 --> 01:34:08,883
Where my baby at?

2232
01:34:09,016 --> 01:34:10,151

2233
01:34:10,284 --> 01:34:11,452
Daddy!

2234
01:34:11,620 --> 01:34:12,820
Come on, baby.

2235
01:34:12,953 --> 01:34:14,455
And what the

2236
01:34:14,589 --> 01:34:16,157
around my fucking daughter?

2237
01:34:16,290 --> 01:34:17,825
Say nigga, don't

2238
01:34:17,958 --> 01:34:18,893
in my motherfucking house,

2239

You better tone

2242
01:34:23,632 --> 01:34:25,634
You out your rabbit ass mind.

2243
01:34:25,766 --> 01:34:27,201
Hey, man, shut the fuck up.

2244
01:34:27,334 --> 01:34:28,435
Baby, go to the car.

2245
01:34:28,570 --> 01:34:29,770
It's already unlocked.

2246
01:34:29,904 --> 01:34:30,871
But what about my bag?

2247
01:34:31,005 --> 01:34:31,939
We don't need your bag, baby.

2248
01:34:32,072 --> 01:34:33,374
We gonna get you some new stuff.

2249
01:34:33,508 --> 01:34:34,909
- Okay, daddy.
- Come on, baby.

2250
01:34:35,042 --> 01:34:37,111
Daddy will be right back, okay?

2251
01:34:38,647 --> 01:34:40,047
What the fuck is wrong with you?

2252
01:34:40,181 --> 01:34:41,448
- Hey now, Donald!

Why you don't quit

You ain't cut for this.

Nah, you

It's open, man.
It's open!

2474
01:42:16,370 --> 01:42:17,270
Get this shit, man.

2475
01:42:17,404 --> 01:42:18,973
I got it. Come on.

2476
01:42:19,607 --> 01:42:22,242
Let's get this
money and the dope.

2477
01:42:24,144 --> 01:42:25,747
Nigga, stop

2478
01:42:26,514 --> 01:42:27,982
What the fuck?

2479
01:42:28,116 --> 01:42:29,282
What, nigga?

2480
01:42:29,550 --> 01:42:31,351
Nigga,

2481
01:42:32,319 --> 01:42:33,688
Man, get

2482
01:42:35,222 --> 01:42:37,025
- What is that?
- Yo, man, what the fuck!

2483
01:42:37,525 --> 01:42:39,259
Oh, man, it's
just the police, man.

2484
01:42:39,393 --> 01:42:40,528
Just the police?

2485
01:42:40,662 --> 01:42:41,996
What the fuck
you mean, the police?

2486
01:42:42,130 --> 01:42:43,564
They just come
through this motherfucker

2487
01:42:43,698 --> 01:42:45,099
once a month to
check our paperwork

2488
01:42:45,232 --> 01:42:47,769
to see if we in compliance,
when they know we are.

2489
01:42:47,902 --> 01:42:49,269
Where the fuck
is the paperwork?

2490
01:42:49,403 --> 01:42:50,905
It's in the front with Dee.

2491
01:42:51,039 --> 01:42:52,272
He gon' show it to 'em

2492
01:42:52,406 --> 01:42:54,241
and they gon get
the fuck outta here.

2493
01:42:54,374 --> 01:42:55,543
For real.

2494
01:42:55,677 --> 01:42:56,611
Man,
what the fuck nigga.

2495
01:42:56,744 --> 01:42:58,211
The police in the fucking front.

2496
01:42:58,345 --> 01:42:59,647
Fuck. I'mma

2497
01:42:59,781 --> 01:43:00,915
Man, hell no, nigga.

2498
01:43:01,049 --> 01:43:02,249
Hold the fuck back.

2499
01:43:02,382 --> 01:43:03,985
Man, what the fuck
are we gonna do?

2500
01:43:04,118 --> 01:43:06,154
Nigga, kill them
motherfuckers, nigga.

2501
01:43:06,286 --> 01:43:07,155
Man, hell no, nigga.

2502
01:43:07,287 --> 01:43:08,488
It's the fucking police.

2503
01:43:08,623 --> 01:43:10,223
You wanna
go to jail, nigga?

2504
01:43:10,357 --> 01:43:11,526
Oh, shit!

2505
01:43:12,093 --> 01:43:13,293
What the fuck!

2506
01:43:13,427 --> 01:43:14,629
Man, what the fuck?

2507
01:43:14,762 --> 01:43:16,430
This nigga just pissed
on himself, man.

2508
01:43:16,564 --> 01:43:17,699
What the fuck!

2509
01:43:17,832 --> 01:43:19,366
Oh, shit!

2510
01:43:19,499 --> 01:43:21,035
Nigga, oh, come on.
Scary ass nigga.

2511
01:43:21,169 --> 01:43:22,302
Nigga, shut up, nigga.

2512
01:43:22,436 --> 01:43:23,604
Pissy ass nigga.

2513
01:43:23,738 --> 01:43:24,972
Now the word is,

2514
01:43:25,106 --> 01:43:26,273
that you guys have been selling

2515
01:43:26,406 --> 01:43:27,441
more than the legal
maximum amount

2516
01:43:27,575 --> 01:43:29,443
of grams to any individual

2517
01:43:29,577 --> 01:43:31,445
who offers up the
right amount of cash.

2518
01:43:32,980 --> 01:43:34,481
Man, you know
that's some bullshit.

2519
01:43:34,615 --> 01:43:37,284
No, nigga. That's some
motherfucking real shit.

2520
01:43:38,186 --> 01:43:39,286
Y'all still don't believe

2521
01:43:39,419 --> 01:43:41,155
that fat meat is greasy?

2522
01:43:43,091 --> 01:43:44,525
Well y'all know we've been
on the straight and narrow.

2523
01:43:44,659 --> 01:43:45,760
We know the city
didn't want us here

2524
01:43:45,893 --> 01:43:47,061
from the beginning.

2525
01:43:47,195 --> 01:43:49,630
Well, we gotta see
how straight you guys are.

2526
01:43:51,899 --> 01:43:53,034
Come on.

2527
01:43:53,668 --> 01:43:54,936
Let's go see all that paperwork.

2528
01:43:55,069 --> 01:43:57,171
Y'all on some bullshit.

2529
01:43:57,304 --> 01:43:58,706
I see what this is.

2530
01:43:59,207 --> 01:44:00,842
Shall we take this to the back?

2531
01:44:01,109 --> 01:44:03,077
Y'all wanna unlock
that door for us now?

2532
01:44:03,211 --> 01:44:04,679
I really don't.

2533
01:44:04,812 --> 01:44:05,680
Please do.

2534
01:44:16,224 --> 01:44:17,091
Shazam!

2535
01:44:18,693 --> 01:44:20,260
I think we found
their paperwork, partner.

2536
01:44:21,562 --> 01:44:23,064
Mm, mm, mm.

2537
01:44:23,197 --> 01:44:24,165
Now,

2538
01:44:24,297 --> 01:44:25,265
we just gonna, you know,

2539
01:44:25,398 --> 01:44:27,034
act like we don't see

2540
01:44:27,168 --> 01:44:28,435
these white packages

2541
01:44:28,569 --> 01:44:31,304
filled with non-FDA
approved substances.

2542
01:44:31,606 --> 01:44:34,374
If y'all make sure

2543
01:44:34,509 --> 01:44:38,613
we see green this
time around, dig?

2544
01:44:39,446 --> 01:44:41,015
Now, pay attention.

2545
01:44:41,149 --> 01:44:42,482
I'll quarterback this for you,

2546
01:44:42,617 --> 01:44:44,484
'cause you look a
little like you deficient.

2547
01:44:44,652 --> 01:44:46,254
Now, just what we see open

2548
01:44:46,386 --> 01:44:47,487
in plain sight,

2549
01:44:47,622 --> 01:44:49,223
you're looking
at a long vacation

2550
01:44:49,356 --> 01:44:51,458
in a federal penitentiary resort

2551
01:44:52,193 --> 01:44:53,393
Mm-hmm.

2552
01:44:53,528 --> 01:44:54,427
Oh, yeah.
This is definitely

2553
01:44:54,562 --> 01:44:56,097
some Scarface type of shit

2554
01:44:56,230 --> 01:44:57,131
going on up in here.

2555
01:44:57,265 --> 01:44:58,298
Now listen,

2556
01:44:58,633 --> 01:45:00,601
we're talking
municipal violations

2557
01:45:00,735 --> 01:45:03,137
of patient purchase
limit violations,

2558
01:45:03,271 --> 01:45:05,273
failure to report inventory,

2559
01:45:05,405 --> 01:45:07,374
state and federal
crimes of possession

2560
01:45:07,508 --> 01:45:08,609
with intent to sell,

2561
01:45:08,743 --> 01:45:10,410
what looks like
crystal meth to me

2562
01:45:10,545 --> 01:45:11,913
and I haven't
even gotten started

2563
01:45:12,046 --> 01:45:14,615
on the RICO acts your
organization has committed.

2564
01:45:15,216 --> 01:45:16,150
Now,

2565
01:45:16,551 --> 01:45:18,152
just imagine how
they're gonna feel

2566
01:45:18,286 --> 01:45:19,854
when this operation shut down

2567
01:45:19,987 --> 01:45:21,454
and you just might start

2568
01:45:21,589 --> 01:45:22,957
singing like the Temptations.

2569
01:45:27,460 --> 01:45:28,629
Nigga, listen.

2570
01:45:28,796 --> 01:45:31,098
What the nigga is saying to you

2571
01:45:31,232 --> 01:45:32,233
is y'all motherfuckers

2572
01:45:32,365 --> 01:45:34,602
need to liquify these palms.

2573
01:45:35,236 --> 01:45:36,103
And I ain't talking about

2574
01:45:36,237 --> 01:45:38,272
with Jergens, jerk-off.

2575
01:45:40,174 --> 01:45:41,474
What's going on here?

2576
01:45:41,709 --> 01:45:43,244
What the fuck
is going on here?

2577
01:45:43,376 --> 01:45:44,679
Y'all got some damn cats?

2578
01:45:44,812 --> 01:45:46,314
It smell like peepee in here.

2579
01:45:51,451 --> 01:45:53,221
Oh! Shit!

2580
01:45:53,353 --> 01:45:54,354
Oh, fuck! Oh!

2581
01:45:58,358 --> 01:45:59,492
Nigga, what the fuck!

2582
01:46:00,995 --> 01:46:02,763
Y'all niggas just
shot the police!

2583
01:46:03,164 --> 01:46:05,465
Nigga, I'm starting
to like this shit.

2584
01:46:06,133 --> 01:46:08,169
What about
these two niggas?

2585
01:46:08,302 --> 01:46:09,436
Fuck 'em.

2586
01:46:19,647 --> 01:46:21,916
Yo, why the
fuck did you do that?

2587
01:46:22,250 --> 01:46:23,351
Nigga, we got three dead

2588
01:46:23,483 --> 01:46:25,385
law enforcement
right here, nigga.

2589
01:46:25,586 --> 01:46:26,587
Fuck you think
they was gonna say?

2590
01:46:26,721 --> 01:46:28,723
They just fell out the sky?

2591
01:46:29,590 --> 01:46:31,859
Nigga, the less witnesses
the better, bro.

2592
01:46:32,293 --> 01:46:34,729
Nah, he right, baby bro.

2593
01:46:35,563 --> 01:46:36,564
Yeah.

2594
01:46:36,697 --> 01:46:37,765
Yeah, I know I'm right, nigga.

2595
01:46:37,899 --> 01:46:39,233
The fuck
you doing, bro?

2596
01:46:44,238 --> 01:46:45,773
Stop playin', Satin.

2597
01:46:46,574 --> 01:46:47,508
Nigga, I ain't playin'.

2598
01:46:49,043 --> 01:46:50,211
What the
fuck you doing, Dale?

2599
01:46:50,344 --> 01:46:51,746
Why the fuck you shoot Bosco?

2600
01:46:51,879 --> 01:46:53,581
That nigga would've
died for us, bro!

2601
01:46:53,714 --> 01:46:55,650
Nigga, he
just did, nigga.

2602
01:46:56,617 --> 01:46:57,752
Now nigga, you next,
- Hell no.

2603
01:46:57,885 --> 01:46:59,287
Nigga, if you
don't make the

2604
01:46:59,419 --> 01:47:00,288
- Right decision, nigga.
- The fuck?

2605
01:47:01,454 --> 01:47:02,489
You in or you out?

2606
01:47:04,292 --> 01:47:05,726
You're go-

2607
01:47:05,860 --> 01:47:07,194
Whatever the fuck
we gonna do, nigga,

2608
01:47:07,328 --> 01:47:08,495
we gotta do that shit.

2609
01:47:09,230 --> 01:47:11,265
All right, nigga,
let's get this shit

2610
01:47:11,399 --> 01:47:12,900
and get up outta here, nigga.

2611
01:47:14,268 --> 01:47:15,403
But before we go,

2612
01:47:15,536 --> 01:47:16,971
I gotta let you
know something, bro.

2613
01:47:18,572 --> 01:47:20,440
Nigga, that shit could
wait, nigga. What the fuck?

2614
01:47:20,574 --> 01:47:21,676
Yeah, it could wait,

2615
01:47:21,809 --> 01:47:23,544
but I'mma let you
know right now.

2616
01:47:23,678 --> 01:47:24,912
You know that baby

2617
01:47:25,613 --> 01:47:27,480
that's in your girl's stomach?

2618
01:47:28,316 --> 01:47:29,650
Yeah, that's mine, nigga.

2619
01:47:29,784 --> 01:47:31,385
What the fuck
is you talking about?

2620
01:47:31,519 --> 01:47:32,452
Do the math, nigga.

2621
01:47:32,586 --> 01:47:33,654
You was on hiatus from the pussy

2622
01:47:33,788 --> 01:47:34,655
for two weeks, nigga,

2623
01:47:34,789 --> 01:47:35,990
before you went to jail.

2624
01:47:37,792 --> 01:47:39,827
How you think I know about that?

2625
01:47:40,361 --> 01:47:41,429
Huh?

2626
01:47:41,562 --> 01:47:43,496
She told me y'all was on break.

2627
01:47:43,631 --> 01:47:45,366
She thought you
was still fucking Tasha.

2628
01:47:47,268 --> 01:47:49,603
And that night
after you got knocked,

2629
01:47:49,737 --> 01:47:51,405
she called me
after you called her.

2630
01:47:54,709 --> 01:47:55,776
Now you know why I took so long

2631
01:47:55,910 --> 01:47:57,745
for your bond to go through.

2632
01:48:00,147 --> 01:48:02,482
I was cashing in on
that coochie first.

2633
01:48:05,252 --> 01:48:07,788
She fucked me for your
bail money, home boy.

2634
01:48:08,522 --> 01:48:09,690
A pretty admirable thing to do,

2635
01:48:09,824 --> 01:48:12,760
but kind of whorish at the same

2636
01:48:12,893 --> 01:48:14,494
I told you, you can't
trust these hoes

2637
01:48:14,628 --> 01:48:16,330
as far as you could throw 'em.

2638
01:48:17,264 --> 01:48:19,033
Let's just get this shit
and get up outta here.

2639
01:48:19,166 --> 01:48:21,268
We got a baby
to raise, my nigga.

2640
01:48:21,402 --> 01:48:23,771
I woulda merked you, my nigga,

2641
01:48:23,904 --> 01:48:27,575
but, uh, somebody gotta
change them shitty ass diapers.

2642
01:48:29,643 --> 01:48:31,379
Nigga, fuck you, nigga.

2643
01:48:31,512 --> 01:48:33,114
Nigga, fuck me, nigga?

2644
01:48:33,247 --> 01:48:34,482
That's how you
talk to the father

2645
01:48:34,615 --> 01:48:35,683
of your child, nigga?

2646
01:48:38,252 --> 01:48:39,653
Man, nigga, you
couldn't bust your gun

2647
01:48:39,787 --> 01:48:41,522
on these motherfuckers,

2648
01:48:41,756 --> 01:48:43,024
just like your daddy couldn't

2649
01:48:43,157 --> 01:48:45,693
in that massage
parlor robbery in '92.

2650
01:48:45,960 --> 01:48:47,828
Did you think I
don't know the foul?

2651
01:48:47,962 --> 01:48:50,631
You can't even bust a nut
in your bitch right.

2652
01:48:50,765 --> 01:48:53,000
I'm 'posed to think
you finna kill me?

2653
01:48:53,467 --> 01:48:54,268
Nigga, stop playing.

2654
01:48:54,402 --> 01:48:55,636
Put the gun down, nigga.

2655
01:48:55,770 --> 01:48:57,004
You ain't no killer, nigga.
Let's go.

2656
01:49:10,519 --> 01:49:12,620
That was a foul little nigga.

2657
01:49:31,839 --> 01:49:33,607
Go on, little fool.

2658
01:50:01,570 --> 01:50:02,837
Mayor Taylor.

2659
01:50:03,737 --> 01:50:05,106
What an ingenious idea

2660
01:50:05,239 --> 01:50:07,908
to meet outside the city limits
of South Central.

2661
01:50:08,042 --> 01:50:09,844
Big Brother can't
see this far, right?

2662
01:50:09,977 --> 01:50:11,612
Yeah.
We don't need anybody

2663
01:50:11,745 --> 01:50:14,014
seeing us together after hours.

2664
01:50:14,482 --> 01:50:15,749
I attract attention when I move,

2665
01:50:15,883 --> 01:50:17,451
especially when I'm with...

2666
01:50:18,886 --> 01:50:20,555
special interests.

2667
01:50:20,688 --> 01:50:23,424
Yeah, well, my
melanin filled friend,

2668
01:50:23,558 --> 01:50:26,460
I don't think anyone's gonna be
able to see you tonight.

2669
01:50:26,595 --> 01:50:27,761
Me on the other hand...

2670
01:50:28,662 --> 01:50:30,664
How about
we cut to the fucking chase

2671
01:50:30,798 --> 01:50:31,932
finalize this shit.

2672
01:50:32,066 --> 01:50:35,604
Listening to your
colonizer humor

2673
01:50:35,736 --> 01:50:36,904
isn't part of the deal.

2674
01:50:37,037 --> 01:50:39,740
Well, I hope selling
out your people

2675
01:50:39,874 --> 01:50:41,108
still is.

2676
01:50:45,746 --> 01:50:47,748
You have the city council vote,

2677
01:50:47,882 --> 01:50:51,185
three to two, in your favor.

2678
01:50:51,318 --> 01:50:52,486
That's assured.

2679
01:50:52,621 --> 01:50:53,687
It better be.

2680
01:50:54,455 --> 01:50:56,423
Do I need to remind you
of the repercussions

2681
01:50:56,558 --> 01:50:59,360
should you not fulfill
your end of things?

2682
01:50:59,493 --> 01:51:00,361
Excuse me?

2683
01:51:00,494 --> 01:51:01,896
Fuck it.

2684
01:51:02,029 --> 01:51:03,464
You know what? Let me
go ahead and do something.

2685
01:51:03,697 --> 01:51:04,798
I have key people

2686
01:51:04,932 --> 01:51:06,734
in high places.

2687
01:51:08,769 --> 01:51:10,371
They will jump into
action on command,

2688
01:51:10,504 --> 01:51:11,505
and you won't know who

2689
01:51:11,640 --> 01:51:13,140
or where they'd be coming from.

2690
01:51:13,874 --> 01:51:15,109
Cash,

2691
01:51:15,242 --> 01:51:16,377
moves people to do

2692
01:51:16,511 --> 01:51:18,513
very dastardly things.

2693
01:51:18,647 --> 01:51:19,680
You know this.

2694
01:51:19,813 --> 01:51:20,781
Hmm?

2695
01:51:22,750 --> 01:51:23,684
You fucking threatening me?

2696
01:51:23,817 --> 01:51:25,152
No.

2697
01:51:25,554 --> 01:51:26,487
I'm just essentially

2698
01:51:26,621 --> 01:51:27,589
reading you the unwritten

2699
01:51:27,721 --> 01:51:29,690
penalty clause of our agreement.

2700
01:51:30,457 --> 01:51:33,027
If you should
breach this agreement,

2701
01:51:33,794 --> 01:51:35,229
a new agreement

2702
01:51:35,796 --> 01:51:37,097
will be

2703
01:51:38,332 --> 01:51:39,500
executed.

2704
01:51:40,100 --> 01:51:41,302
All right, Barnett.

2705
01:51:42,770 --> 01:51:44,038
We do it your way.

2706
01:51:44,705 --> 01:51:45,607
Fuck you.

2707
01:51:46,740 --> 01:51:47,609
And fuck that money.

2708
01:51:56,585 --> 01:51:58,185
This South Central all mine.

2709
01:52:03,390 --> 01:52:04,258
I'm it's mayor.

2710
01:52:29,083 --> 01:52:30,818
- Hey, Donald!
- Oh shit!

2711
01:52:30,951 --> 01:52:32,520
Hurry up!

2712
01:52:32,654 --> 01:52:33,320
Oh shit!

2713
01:52:33,454 --> 01:52:34,556
Get in the car!

2714
01:52:34,689 --> 01:52:36,023
You scared the fuck out of me!

2715
01:52:36,156 --> 01:52:37,626
- Hurry up!
- Whose car is this?

2716
01:52:37,758 --> 01:52:39,860
It's one of my brother's. Go!

2717
01:52:39,994 --> 01:52:40,861
Oh fuck!

2718
01:52:40,995 --> 01:52:42,429
Did you pack the truck?

2719
01:52:42,564 --> 01:52:44,331
Of course I did.
Could you not talk shit.

2720
01:52:45,199 --> 01:52:46,200
Oh shit!

2721
01:52:46,333 --> 01:52:48,002
- What happened?
- Fuck!

2722
01:52:48,135 --> 01:52:50,739
What the fuck is going on?

2723
01:52:50,871 --> 01:52:52,072
Oh shit!

2724
01:52:52,906 --> 01:52:54,041
Man, just fucking drive.

2725
01:52:54,174 --> 01:52:55,610
I'mma tell you
on the fucking road.

2726
01:52:55,744 --> 01:52:56,745
Just go.

2727
01:52:56,877 --> 01:52:58,279
Don't stop for shit.

2728
01:52:58,647 --> 01:52:59,847
We got a long fucking time

2729
01:52:59,980 --> 01:53:01,315
to talk about this shit.

2730
01:53:15,764 --> 01:53:18,533
Oh, look who showed up

2731
01:53:18,667 --> 01:53:20,134
and showed out.

2732
01:53:21,235 --> 01:53:23,070
See, I knew you still had

2733
01:53:23,203 --> 01:53:25,272
a little nigga left
in you, Randall.

2734
01:53:26,775 --> 01:53:28,909
Real men do what they have to.

2735
01:53:29,810 --> 01:53:31,412
I never lost sight of who I am.

2736
01:53:33,480 --> 01:53:35,015
Let me up in this bitch

2737
01:53:35,215 --> 01:53:37,251
before somebody
sees me out here.

2738
01:53:37,752 --> 01:53:39,253
Hey, well, come on in,

2739
01:53:41,355 --> 01:53:42,356
Mayor.

2740
01:53:55,302 --> 01:53:57,905
Clearly, you know it's done.

2741
01:53:58,372 --> 01:53:59,708
Of course I do.

2742
01:53:59,940 --> 01:54:01,842
Piper is dismantling
and disposing

2743
01:54:01,975 --> 01:54:03,678
the body as we speak.

2744
01:54:05,879 --> 01:54:06,815
How do I know none of this

2745
01:54:06,947 --> 01:54:08,215
is gonna get out?

2746
01:54:08,349 --> 01:54:09,718
Look, when
you gonna come down

2747
01:54:09,850 --> 01:54:10,984
out of that cloud you in

2748
01:54:11,118 --> 01:54:12,721
and realize I have
just as much

2749
01:54:12,853 --> 01:54:14,254
to lose as you do,

2750
01:54:14,955 --> 01:54:16,190
Mayor?

2751
01:54:18,058 --> 01:54:19,226
You know what, you look like

2752
01:54:19,360 --> 01:54:20,294
you need some
coffee or something.

2753
01:54:20,427 --> 01:54:21,862
You know, I got some of that

2754
01:54:21,995 --> 01:54:24,231
freshly imported
shit from Columbia.

2755
01:54:24,666 --> 01:54:26,066
You know, let me
be a hospitable boy

2756
01:54:26,200 --> 01:54:27,901
and go get you a cup.

2757
01:54:28,035 --> 01:54:30,638
You know, how about
a Cuban, huh, to boot?

2758
01:54:30,772 --> 01:54:32,707
Ease them nerves? Huh?

2759
01:54:32,841 --> 01:54:33,708
Fuentes, my brother?

2760
01:54:33,842 --> 01:54:34,908
Fuck you.

2761
01:54:37,478 --> 01:54:39,046
Last thing I need is
a fucking cup of coffee

2762
01:54:39,179 --> 01:54:40,648
right now, Ron.

2763
01:54:40,782 --> 01:54:42,784
You know what?
You're shaky enough without it.

2764
01:54:42,916 --> 01:54:44,451
Which is understandable

2765
01:54:44,586 --> 01:54:47,321
since this is your
first body and all.

2766
01:54:51,125 --> 01:54:52,359
My last one.

2767
01:54:57,064 --> 01:54:59,099
Where the master files at?

2768
01:54:59,933 --> 01:55:02,102
They're safely stored
away somewhere.

2769
01:55:04,071 --> 01:55:05,239
I thought we were square.

2770
01:55:05,372 --> 01:55:07,007
Come on, that's leverage, nigga.

2771
01:55:07,141 --> 01:55:08,242
You know how you politicians

2772
01:55:08,375 --> 01:55:10,377
be flipping and
flopping and shit.

2773
01:55:10,512 --> 01:55:11,813
But don't worry.

2774
01:55:12,747 --> 01:55:15,315
You know, they're good
as long as you're good.

2775
01:55:16,183 --> 01:55:17,151
And I'm not gonna set you up

2776
01:55:17,284 --> 01:55:19,153
for the fall like them Feds did.

2777
01:55:19,286 --> 01:55:20,522
Very kind to you.

2778
01:55:23,090 --> 01:55:24,324
What do you mean by good?

2779
01:55:24,458 --> 01:55:27,227
Good and
honorable to my people.

2780
01:55:28,797 --> 01:55:32,700
Your priority is to
honor and protect

2781
01:55:32,834 --> 01:55:34,968
this city at all costs.

2782
01:55:35,737 --> 01:55:37,605
Now as long as we
understand that and

2783
01:55:37,739 --> 01:55:39,808
You on the right path.

2784
01:55:39,940 --> 01:55:43,277
Look man, those fouls will
never see the light of day.

2785
01:55:49,517 --> 01:55:50,552
A'ight.

2786
01:55:51,251 --> 01:55:52,720
They better not.

2787
01:55:57,224 --> 01:55:58,560
Here you go.

2788
01:56:00,294 --> 01:56:01,228
The money Barnett gave me

2789
01:56:01,361 --> 01:56:03,063
in exchange for that vote.

2790
01:56:03,197 --> 01:56:04,599
That ain't happening now.

2791
01:56:04,732 --> 01:56:06,634
You know what, I'm
glad you brought that up.

2792
01:56:06,868 --> 01:56:09,704
So now it's three to two
against, now, right?

2793
01:56:09,838 --> 01:56:10,705
That's right.

2794
01:56:10,839 --> 01:56:11,806
Hmm.

2795
01:56:11,940 --> 01:56:12,807
My vote being the swing vote.

2796
01:56:14,876 --> 01:56:16,477
Show you right.
Show you right.

2797
01:56:18,078 --> 01:56:19,313
Well, you can take that money.

2798
01:56:19,446 --> 01:56:21,215
Don't nobody know
where it came from.

2799
01:56:28,857 --> 01:56:30,023
I know where it came from.

2800
01:56:30,157 --> 01:56:31,024
Hey, man,
look man,

2801
01:56:31,158 --> 01:56:32,092
you can put that money

2802
01:56:32,226 --> 01:56:34,061
to some good use, you know.

2803
01:56:34,294 --> 01:56:37,431
Possibly your
reelection campaign.

2804
01:56:38,900 --> 01:56:40,267
That money got blood on it.

2805
01:56:40,400 --> 01:56:42,069
Man, what money don't?

2806
01:56:42,770 --> 01:56:44,004
Look, you better
take that money, nigga,

2807
01:56:44,137 --> 01:56:46,006
before I change my mind.

2808
01:56:47,040 --> 01:56:48,008
And then after that,

2809
01:56:48,141 --> 01:56:50,344
go home and get you some rest.

2810
01:56:50,879 --> 01:56:54,147
We don't want you going
to that city council meeting

2811
01:56:54,281 --> 01:56:57,451
looking like a man
who was up all night

2812
01:56:57,585 --> 01:56:59,086
doing dirt.

2813
01:56:59,654 --> 01:57:00,855
You know,

2814
01:57:01,388 --> 01:57:03,156
like committing murder.

2815
01:57:06,126 --> 01:57:07,662
Hey look and
don't forget to tell

2816
01:57:07,795 --> 01:57:09,329
your colleagues downtown
that they don't have to worry

2817
01:57:09,463 --> 01:57:11,599
about that dispensary
over there on Century.

2818
01:57:13,001 --> 01:57:15,469
Somebody took
care of that for y'all.

2819
01:57:19,139 --> 01:57:20,575
I bet they did.

2820
01:57:52,439 --> 01:57:53,373
Boy, life just seem

2821
01:57:53,508 --> 01:57:55,342
to get tougher by the day,

2822
01:57:56,176 --> 01:57:58,546
especially in a
city like South Central.

2823
01:57:59,279 --> 01:58:01,916
I never thought things
would evolve like this.

2824
01:58:03,250 --> 01:58:04,284
I could blame the city.

2825
01:58:04,418 --> 01:58:05,787
I could blame my father.

2826
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:09,089
I could certainly blame
the powers to be as well.

2827
01:58:09,222 --> 01:58:12,760
But I will forever share
some of the blame.

2828
01:58:12,894 --> 01:58:15,863
While I figure all that shit out
about how I got here,

2829
01:58:15,997 --> 01:58:17,097
I still gotta figure out

2830
01:58:17,230 --> 01:58:18,933
where I'm going
from here as well.

2831
01:58:19,901 --> 01:58:21,970
If Satin was telling
the truth about my baby

2832
01:58:22,102 --> 01:58:24,639
and how I gotta put this
dirty money to good use

2833
01:58:24,772 --> 01:58:27,107
and just about
the future overall.

2834
01:58:33,347 --> 01:58:34,682
One thing's for sure,

2835
01:58:34,816 --> 01:58:37,351
I need to get the fuck
out of South Central.

2836
01:58:38,485 --> 01:58:40,187
I might never return.

2837
01:58:40,320 --> 01:58:41,723
It's hard to say.

2838
01:58:41,856 --> 01:58:43,992
Then again, my
pops is coming home

2839
01:58:44,124 --> 01:58:45,425
in a few months.

2840
01:58:45,560 --> 01:58:48,128
Ain't no telling what
he gonna be on or need.

2841
01:58:48,395 --> 01:58:50,230
I mean, he is South Central.

2842
01:58:50,364 --> 01:58:52,199
And I'm a product of him

2843
01:58:52,332 --> 01:58:58,238
and our city
forever.
