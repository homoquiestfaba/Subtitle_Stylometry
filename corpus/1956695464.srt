00:01:34,828 --> 00:01:36,398

7
00:01:39,666 --> 00:01:43,808

00:01:47,674 --> 00:01:51,087

00:01:51,311 --> 00:01:52,449

00:02:00,520 --> 00:02:03,831
Look Norma! I found another
hurt bird!

12
00:02:04,057 --> 00:02:06,230
Oh Daryl, not again!

13
00:02:06,526 --> 00:02:09,006
What? Nothing should be in pain!

14
00:02:09,229 --> 00:02:12,403
Ok sweetie but hurry up, your
breakfast is going to get cold!

15
00:02:12,632 --> 00:02:13,702
Ok dear!

16
00:02:16,870 --> 00:02:18,042
Hey Daryl...

17
00:02:18,271 --> 00:02:18,840
Yes dear?

18
00:02:19,072 --> 00:02:22,451
When do you think we'll get
approved for the birthing?

19
00:02:22,675 --> 00:02:24,416
Oh very soon I'm sure!

20
00:02:24,644 --> 00:02:26,180
We filled out all the
paperwork,

21
00:02:26,412 --> 00:02:28,323
went through all the
necessary steps,

22
00:02:28,548 --> 00:02:30,528
These things just take time...

23
00:02:30,750 --> 00:02:34,254
Yeah I know, I just...

24
00:02:34,521 --> 00:02:37,263
Oh how great it would be to
have a child daryl!

How I would love to
raise achild in Heaven!

26
00:02:41,461 --> 00:02:44,738
There ya go little guy, now

27
00:02:44,964 --> 00:02:48,673
it'll take a couple
days for you to heal

00:02:48,902 --> 00:02:53,510
ha-ha-ha, Can we have a boy?
I would really love a boy!

29
00:02:53,740 --> 00:02:55,947
Oh a boy would be wonderful!

30
00:02:57,010 --> 00:02:59,513
<i>I'll</i> get m

31
00:03:07,921 --> 00:03:14,896
Good morning! Is this the home of
Citizen Daryl, and Citizen Norma?

32
00:03:15,128 --> 00:03:16,300
Yes Siry!

33
00:03:16,529 --> 00:03:21,205

living in heaven for...

34
00:03:21,434 --> 00:03:23,914

soul has been approved!

00:03:33,713 --> 00:03:35,659
So if you and your wife would
like to join me

39
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:41,230
We have perpared a vehicle to go
to the birthing center right now!

40
00:03:41,454 --> 00:03:47,928
It's the messenger, he's come for us! Norma,

00:03:50,763 --> 00:03:57,806
Our child! our child! This is great!
This is wonderful!

00:03:59,305 --> 00:04:01,945
Oh daryl I love you so much!

44
00:04:02,175 --> 00:04:06,624
I love you too, and you're
going to be a great mother!

45
00:05:02,602 --> 00:05:07,017
It is now the time to start
the birthing process!

46
00:05:07,240 --> 00:05:11,017
Are you ready Citizen Norma?

47
00:05:11,244 --> 00:05:11,847
I am!

48
00:05:12,078 --> 00:05:15,252
Have you chosen a name for
him yet?

49
00:05:15,481 --> 00:05:18,360
Yes! We wish to call him...

50
00:05:18,918 --> 00:05:21,831
Marius! Little Marius!

51
00:05:22,055 --> 00:05:25,832
Do you two solemnly swear to
raise Marius in accordance

52
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:29,802
with the texts that Caine
has provided us?

53
00:05:30,029 --> 00:05:31,269
Yes sir!

54
00:05:31,497 --> 00:05:34,706
Do you promise to keep marius
away from the wall

55
00:05:34,934 --> 00:05:38,040
and the evil one that dwells
behind it?

56
00:05:38,271 --> 00:05:40,376
Yes sir!

57
00:05:40,606 --> 00:05:44,952
It is your job to raise your
child up right here in heaven

58
00:05:45,178 --> 00:05:49,354
So that when God gets back,
which should be any day now,

59
00:05:49,582 --> 00:05:53,997
He can look in the eyes of our
newest citizen and know that

60
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:57,827
they are ready to love
him unconditionally!

61
00:05:58,057 --> 00:06:02,062
Let us all thank Caine together!

62
00:06:07,200 --> 00:06:12,200
(crowd chanting)
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

63
00:07:22,275 --> 00:07:24,983
This is where we keep
the worms babies

64
00:07:25,211 --> 00:07:28,715
We care for them until they're
ready to be harvested

65
00:07:28,948 --> 00:07:32,486
do you accept that
responsibility?

66
00:07:32,718 --> 00:07:35,096
We do, we do! We surely,
surely do!

67
00:07:35,321 --> 00:07:39,861
Yes! I'm so happy to be given
this honor! I've wanted this

68
00:07:40,092 --> 00:07:42,595
for as long as I can remember!

69
00:07:42,829 --> 00:07:46,743
Then look over at our inventory
and pick the one that looks

70
00:07:46,966 --> 00:07:48,172
the most beautiful to you

71
00:07:48,401 --> 00:07:53,111
take your time,
and choose wisely!

72
00:07:58,678 --> 00:08:02,182
Aaawww this one has
your mothers eyes!

73
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:05,259
Eeww, this one's too messy!

74
00:08:07,320 --> 00:08:10,460
He-he, ooh, that one has too
much energy!

75
00:08:10,690 --> 00:08:12,761
- Eehhh, it's a little
bit too fat

76
00:08:12,992 --> 00:08:14,198
- That one's too bumpy

77
00:08:14,427 --> 00:08:15,963
-that one has too many veins

78
00:08:16,195 --> 00:08:16,866
- That one's too big!

79
00:08:17,096 --> 00:08:19,906
Aawaww, what's wrong with
that one?

80
00:08:20,132 --> 00:08:25,104
He's just tired, he's
been here for a long time

81
00:08:25,338 --> 00:08:28,547
Nobody has ever wanted him

82
00:08:28,774 --> 00:08:30,981
<i>aaawww, Gary“.!</i>

83
00:08:31,344 --> 00:08:34,223
aaww, poor fella!

84
00:08:34,447 --> 00:08:41,592
In a few days we will have
no choice but to put him down

85
00:08:41,821 --> 00:08:44,131
We want this one!

86
00:08:44,357 --> 00:08:48,999
Sweetie are you sure?
What about this one over here?

87
00:08:49,228 --> 00:08:52,971
You of all people should
understand, you're always trying

88
00:08:53,199 --> 00:08:59,809
to save those birds! I want to
save him, please daryl?

89
00:09:04,810 --> 00:09:10,726
Then lift little Marius into your
arms and present him to your peers!

90
00:10:31,130 --> 00:10:36,130
The process has successfully
completed!

91
00:11:07,233 --> 00:11:08,610
This is your home now

92
00:11:08,834 --> 00:11:11,178
you live here, with us!

93
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:14,248
We're what's called, "Parents"

94
00:11:14,707 --> 00:11:16,914
We'll care for you, and love
you

95
00:11:17,143 --> 00:11:20,522
and teach you all about heaven until
you become a man of your ovvn

96
00:11:20,746 --> 00:11:23,886
and-and meet a woman!
and fall in love!

97
00:11:24,116 --> 00:11:26,687
And then, when you're
married for a while

98
00:11:26,919 --> 00:11:31,664
you'll get put on a list for
a child soul of your own!

99
00:11:34,760 --> 00:11:39,834
Look sweetie, he's taking a
liking to Caine already!

100
00:11:40,066 --> 00:11:42,842
That's our savior, Caine!

101
00:11:43,069 --> 00:11:45,675
He watches over us and keeps
us safe from the fiends that

102
00:11:45,905 --> 00:11:47,907
want to come back into heaven
but aren't allowed

103
00:11:48,140 --> 00:11:52,452
if it wasn't for him, none of us
would be able to exist right now

104
00:11:52,678 --> 00:11:58,685
He deserves all our love, all
our praise, and all our thanks.

105
00:11:58,918 --> 00:12:02,923
Come now don't overwhelm the boy
he's going to learn all that

106
00:12:03,155 --> 00:12:05,465
in the education center
tomorrow!

107
00:12:05,791 --> 00:12:08,397
I bet you're hungry little guy!

108
00:12:13,002 --> 00:12:17,141
You see Marius, you just put the
fork into the food, like so

109
00:12:17,369 --> 00:12:23,183
and then lift it up into your
mouth and chew, then swallow

110
00:12:23,409 --> 00:12:26,686
Do you understand?

111
00:12:26,912 --> 00:12:30,519
No, no dear, you have
to speak to him louder!

112
00:12:31,984 --> 00:12:34,965
MARIUS! PUT THE FORK...

113
00:12:35,187 --> 00:12:36,530
NO! THE FORK!

114
00:12:36,756 --> 00:12:38,997
INTO YOUR HAND!

115
00:12:39,258 --> 00:12:42,205
HHAAANNNDDD! YOUR HAND SEE!

116
00:12:42,428 --> 00:12:44,567
YOU HAVE TWO OF THEM!
LOOK!

117
00:12:44,797 --> 00:12:49,746
This is your bedroom. This is where
you'll sleep when it gets dark

118
00:12:49,969 --> 00:12:55,476
Sleeping is a time when we close
our eyes and rest for a while

119
00:12:55,708 --> 00:12:58,188
Caine says we need to rest our
eyes for a few hours a night

120
00:12:58,410 --> 00:13:02,916
Because too much exposure to
God's love can wear on the brain

121
00:13:03,149 --> 00:13:05,060
It needs time to rest...

122
00:13:05,284 --> 00:13:09,926
We love your Marius, and we're
so happy you're here!

123
00:13:33,913 --> 00:13:37,986
Ok son this is it! this is
where you'll be spending a

124
00:13:38,217 --> 00:13:40,993
great deal of time until you get
used to things

125
00:13:41,220 --> 00:13:45,168
You'll learn everything you need
to know to become a functioning

126
00:13:45,391 --> 00:13:46,802
member of our society

127
00:13:47,026 --> 00:13:49,131
It may seem a little
overwhelming at first

128
00:13:49,361 --> 00:13:54,140
but it will help everything make
more sense, I promise

129
00:14:30,502 --> 00:14:33,073
Alright class, please take
your seats

130
00:14:33,305 --> 00:14:37,151
My name is Mr Apple

131
00:14:37,643 --> 00:14:39,520
I'll be your teacher for the
next few yea rs

132
00:14:39,745 --> 00:14:42,589
Now if you turn your
information packets to page 3

133
00:14:42,815 --> 00:14:46,194
We will begin our lesson for
today!

134
00:15:58,290 --> 00:16:01,601
Hi, my name's Marius,
what's yours?

135
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,866
Eden“.

136
00:16:05,097 --> 00:16:05,973
Well...Whatcha' looking at?

137
00:16:07,666 --> 00:16:09,577
<i>The wall...</i>

138
00:16:10,135 --> 00:16:13,173
Don't ya wonder what's behind it?

139
00:16:16,909 --> 00:16:22,825
The evil one and all her lies
dwell behind that wall...

140
00:16:23,215 --> 00:16:28,187
Our lord Caine built the wall to
keep her out forever

141
00:16:29,822 --> 00:16:34,703
You see... Caine and the Evil
One were once a team

142
00:16:34,927 --> 00:16:36,702
They built and founded
heaven together

143
00:16:36,929 --> 00:16:44,211
But our humble lord Cainejust couldn't
tolerate her deceitful ways any more...

144
00:16:44,436 --> 00:16:47,440
She wanted to use and
exploit us!

145
00:16:47,673 --> 00:16:50,153
So Caine did what he had to do!

146
00:16:50,376 --> 00:16:52,378
He did it for us!

147
00:16:52,611 --> 00:16:55,319
He cast her out that filth!

148
00:16:55,547 --> 00:16:58,084
So that we may live
here in peace!

149
00:16:58,317 --> 00:17:01,059
Let us all thank Caine!

150
00:17:23,442 --> 00:17:24,182
Look at you little guy!

151
00:17:24,410 --> 00:17:26,754
You look like you've made a full
recovery

152
00:17:26,979 --> 00:17:29,755
Marius! Come here son!

153
00:17:29,982 --> 00:17:33,088
Ok son, put him down

154
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:40,370
Look at him fly!

155
00:17:40,893 --> 00:17:43,635
You see son, all life in heaven
is equal

156
00:17:43,862 --> 00:17:45,773
One creature is not more
important than the other

157
00:17:45,998 --> 00:17:51,004
we're all alive, and therefore,
we're all loved by God!

158
00:17:51,236 --> 00:17:53,546
And God's love is unconditional!

159
00:17:53,772 --> 00:17:59,051
So if you see one of God's creatures
in danger, it's your duty to help it!

160
00:17:59,278 --> 00:18:02,782
Then, some day, it
might help you back!

161
00:18:03,015 --> 00:18:06,827
Do you understand
what I mean Marius?

162
00:18:12,124 --> 00:18:14,434
Well Gee-wilkers Mr. Dentine

163
00:18:14,660 --> 00:18:18,699
Are you sure it's safe to be carrying
this child so close to the wall while

164
00:18:18,931 --> 00:18:22,310
holding a sign that says
"I Don't Love You Caine"?

165
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:25,981
Sometimes you just gotta walk
on the wild side lil'johnny

166
00:18:26,205 --> 00:18:29,015
Caine ain't the boss of me!
I'm my own man...

167
00:18:29,241 --> 00:18:33,246
In fact, I'm thinking of maybe
even eating meat on fridays

168
00:18:33,479 --> 00:18:35,390
and slappin' my wife in the mouth!

169
00:18:35,614 --> 00:18:36,684
WOOOOOOOOOW!

170
00:18:36,915 --> 00:18:39,759
No Mr. Dentine, say it ain't so!

171
00:18:39,985 --> 00:18:45,094
Don't denounce Caine! don't do
it! Please don't do it!

172
00:18:49,695 --> 00:18:52,574
Oh no Mr. Dentine
it's the evil one!

173
00:18:52,798 --> 00:18:56,837
RRAAWWWRRR! I am The Evil One!

174
00:18:57,069 --> 00:19:01,484
I want to come into your homes
and corrupt your youth!

175
00:19:01,707 --> 00:19:06,850
And there's nothing any of you
can do about it! HAHAHAHA!

176
00:19:07,079 --> 00:19:09,753
Oh my god what have I done!

177
00:19:09,982 --> 00:19:19,104
If only I could turn back time! If only I could accept and
love Caine for the perfect, non-flawed individual that he is

178
00:19:19,858 --> 00:19:22,737
Stop right there you fiend!

179
00:19:23,996 --> 00:19:26,670
Holy fucking shit it's Caine!

180
00:19:26,899 --> 00:19:30,210
NO! I'm here to destroy
this place!

181
00:19:30,435 --> 00:19:33,882
I will have my way with all
the children!

182
00:19:34,106 --> 00:19:35,585
You will do no such thing!

183
00:19:35,807 --> 00:19:39,619
I cast you Back to the
place from which you came!

184
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:43,884
No Caine, No! I love you! and
everything is my fault!

185
00:19:44,116 --> 00:19:49,589
You're so much better at everything,
and better looking than me too...

186
00:19:49,821 --> 00:19:53,132
Please take me back Cainey-pie!
PLEASE!

187
00:19:53,358 --> 00:19:53,836
GOODBYE! BITCH!

188
00:19:59,598 --> 00:20:05,913
Wow thank you ever so kindly Mr. Caine!
I will hereby love you forever!

189
00:20:06,138 --> 00:20:06,673
And do whatever you say!

190
00:20:06,905 --> 00:20:09,886
Ladies and gentlemen, don't take
pitty on her

191
00:20:10,108 --> 00:20:16,650
You will find that once the evil one's minions
have all been purged from our society

192
00:20:16,882 --> 00:20:24,323
that heaven will be a much
brighter, and better place

193
00:21:00,092 --> 00:21:03,972
Caine.. I love you like a father
loves his son...

194
00:21:04,196 --> 00:21:06,198
like a dog loves his master...

195
00:21:06,431 --> 00:21:09,969
like a man loves his lover...
I know that sounds wierd but

196
00:21:10,202 --> 00:21:12,978
I also know that you understand

197
00:21:13,205 --> 00:21:17,654
You see but you're blind without his light!
Where will you go?

198
00:21:17,876 --> 00:21:21,414
Who else will turn to in your
darkest hour?

199
00:21:21,647 --> 00:21:23,388
There is no choice!

200
00:21:23,615 --> 00:21:24,787
Accept the only way!

201
00:21:25,017 --> 00:21:28,430
Accept Caine into your heart and
you will understand the truth!

202
00:21:28,654 --> 00:21:34,002
For there is no love without Caine,
there is no life with out caine

203
00:21:34,226 --> 00:21:36,934
There is nothing without Caine!

204
00:21:37,162 --> 00:21:45,547
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine!

205
00:22:28,880 --> 00:22:32,657

It hurts so bad...

207
00:22:37,289 --> 00:22:42,329
I was trying to peak over the wall
and accidentally fell over...

208
00:22:42,561 --> 00:22:47,567
I think I broke my leg...

209
00:23:03,215 --> 00:23:04,091
Marius, Marius, what's
the matter?

210
00:23:04,316 --> 00:23:07,763

hole, and I-i peaked through it

00:23:44,523 --> 00:23:48,061

221
00:23:48,560 --> 00:23:52,440

227
00:24:09,381 --> 00:24:11,156

00:24:11,383 --> 00:24:13,226
Hey you kids! get away
from there!

229
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:16,062
Oh no! Run!!

230
00:24:16,288 --> 00:24:20,896
No Marius no! we can't leave her!
Marius no! let go of me! Let go of me!

231
00:24:21,126 --> 00:24:24,164
After them! Don't
let them escape!

232
00:24:24,396 --> 00:24:29,641
Search the area, make sure
nothing came through...

233
00:24:29,868 --> 00:24:33,008
Shit boss! where did
this hole come from?

234
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,685
Get this hole sealed up
before anyone sees it

235
00:24:36,908 --> 00:24:40,412
Kill anything that
tries to come through

236
00:24:40,645 --> 00:24:42,591
You got it boss!

237
00:24:55,660 --> 00:25:01,042
They say when you go into it you
fall directly into her hand!

238
00:25:01,266 --> 00:25:09,208
And then she carries back to your home,
where she makes you murder all your pets!

239
00:25:09,441 --> 00:25:13,287
One... by... one!

240
00:25:17,215 --> 00:25:23,666
Well Marius and Eden,
how nice of you to join us!

241
00:25:23,889 --> 00:25:29,134
Sorry Mr Apple I'm not as good
as you are and I never will be.

242
00:25:29,361 --> 00:25:35,243
Mr Apple, I was just wondering
can animals... talk?

243
00:25:35,467 --> 00:25:40,212
Just take your seat now!

244
00:25:40,438 --> 00:25:47,253
Does that mean yes or no?

245
00:25:47,479 --> 00:25:51,188
You already know the answer
Marius

246
00:25:54,719 --> 00:25:56,596
Whoa! Oh man.. Eden!

247
00:25:56,821 --> 00:26:01,133
Whoa did you see that?
He was a big guy!

248
00:26:01,359 --> 00:26:03,703
Whoa! Oh man.. Eden!

249
00:26:03,929 --> 00:26:05,135
You know we have to go back
for that kitty, right?

250
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,640
Are you sure it's such a good idea to
go on the other side of the wall Eden?

251
00:26:08,867 --> 00:26:12,508
All I know is that since I've
been here, nothing has felt right

252
00:26:12,737 --> 00:26:19,552
But when the kitty spoke to me I don't
know, I felt something different.

253
00:26:19,778 --> 00:26:21,280
Didn't you feel it?

254
00:26:21,513 --> 00:26:24,756
Whoa! Eden did you see that!

255
00:26:58,450 --> 00:27:03,399
We have to go back Marius!
We have to help that kitten!

256
00:27:04,923 --> 00:27:09,923
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

257
00:27:58,043 --> 00:28:00,387
Oh! you came back for me!

258
00:28:00,612 --> 00:28:03,601
Yeah just stay still we're going
to rescue you!

259
00:28:03,897 --> 00:28:08,931
Get back in here you little shit stain! or
we're gonna be forced to come and get you!

260
00:28:09,154 --> 00:28:14,194
You don't want that s0n!o the bushes!

261
00:28:15,093 --> 00:28:15,935
- Get back in here right now!

262
00:28:16,161 --> 00:28:24,307
- Hunt them down and kill them! Don't
come back unless you have their heads!

263
00:28:32,243 --> 00:28:34,161
- Here kitty, kitty, kitty here kitty,
kitty, kitty here kitty, come to papa!

264
00:28:34,161 --> 00:28:41,325
You see the fruit on the bush? eat some!
it will make you invisible!

265
00:28:41,500 --> 00:28:44,331
What? No way!

266
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:49,403
They're special! watch
I'll eat some first!

267
00:29:11,082 --> 00:29:15,758
- They went this way!

268
00:29:15,987 --> 00:29:19,400
- Where ever you are, we
won't hurt you!

269
00:29:19,624 --> 00:29:22,240
- I think I heard them over there!

270
00:29:26,831 --> 00:29:28,640
Hurry eat the fruit!

271
00:29:29,817 --> 00:29:31,272
What? NO!

272
00:29:33,705 --> 00:29:36,948
- Come on fuck heads, this way!

273
00:30:12,577 --> 00:30:18,516
I bet you thought you got away didn't youl?
didn't you, you little shit stainl?

274
00:30:18,750 --> 00:30:22,220
No one escapes us!
NOBODY!

275
00:30:22,453 --> 00:30:27,596
We just want to take
you back to Caine!

276
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:22,658
What the fuck is this? what the
fuck is this? Get them out of here!

277
00:32:10,628 --> 00:32:12,005
What happened?

278
00:32:12,230 --> 00:32:16,440
We got away, that's all
that matters!

279
00:32:16,668 --> 00:32:22,380
So tired... maybe we
should go back inside...

280
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:27,556
Where did the hole go? it
was just right there...

281
00:32:27,779 --> 00:32:32,023
It closed to you, well for now
anyway

282
00:32:32,250 --> 00:32:36,255
Once the fruit wears off
you'll be allowed back inside

283
00:32:36,487 --> 00:32:39,593
What do we do until then?

284
00:32:39,824 --> 00:32:46,742
Let's go for a walk! Let me
show you around the world!

285
00:33:53,564 --> 00:33:56,602
What's in there?

286
00:33:57,802 --> 00:34:02,410
Come on, I'll introduce you!

287
00:34:36,607 --> 00:34:38,450
Hello...

288
00:34:41,179 --> 00:34:44,786
What are you doing out here?

289
00:34:45,016 --> 00:34:51,626
I'm trying to find my way back
into the garden...

290
00:34:52,590 --> 00:34:55,799
How did you end up getting
here?

291
00:35:01,599 --> 00:35:09,814
Along time ago...
God was a misfit...

292
00:35:10,942 --> 00:35:15,721
He chose to keep to himself and
he lived alone in the universe

293
00:35:15,947 --> 00:35:20,758
he created beautiful,
radiant stars, circled

294
00:35:20,783 --> 00:35:25,594
by tiny rocks made of
twigs and water...

295
00:35:26,757 --> 00:35:32,673
But they were all vacant, and
without any life...

296
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:41,209
He was lonely, he wanted
to create something new

297
00:36:17,942 --> 00:36:22,942
He played with them non-stop having
every kind of adventure you can imagine

298
00:36:36,494 --> 00:36:39,668
Then when he exhausted all
possible outcomes

299
00:36:39,897 --> 00:36:46,405
He came to the conclusion that the
creatures he created were less than him...

300
00:36:46,637 --> 00:36:51,780
He could never learn from
them only teach them

301
00:36:52,009 --> 00:36:57,618
and for that reason, he could
never fully love them

302
00:36:57,848 --> 00:37:01,352
God wanted something new

303
00:37:01,586 --> 00:37:06,586
He wanted to create pure beauty
and find, love...

304
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:22,644
She had curves... and an
opening instead of protrusion

305
00:37:22,873 --> 00:37:26,912
She was delicate and sweet

306
00:37:27,144 --> 00:37:30,853
all you hate to do was gaze
upon her once

307
00:37:31,082 --> 00:37:36,555
and for the rest of your life she would
be the one that emerges from the darkness

308
00:37:36,787 --> 00:37:40,633
Whenever you closed your eyes...

309
00:37:40,858 --> 00:37:50,677
Oh she was more beautiful than God, and now
he knew what it felt like to fall in love.

310
00:37:53,004 --> 00:37:57,714
But he wasn't the only one
who fell in love..

311
00:37:57,942 --> 00:38:02,220
And they loved me more than
they loved him..

312
00:38:20,865 --> 00:38:25,075
God learned something he
never knew about before...

313
00:38:27,772 --> 00:38:29,012
HEARTBREAK!

314
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:33,620
And from heartbreak grew
jealousy...

315
00:38:33,844 --> 00:38:36,882
and from jealousy came anger...

316
00:38:37,114 --> 00:38:38,889
and finally to hatred!

317
00:38:39,116 --> 00:38:46,625
When god learned how to hate, he saw that the
very fabric of love could easily be broken...

318
00:38:46,857 --> 00:38:50,395
He didn't like the way
it made him feel...

319
00:38:50,628 --> 00:38:53,871
He began to destroy things!

320
00:38:54,098 --> 00:38:57,409
And I lost sight of
where he was...

321
00:39:23,461 --> 00:39:25,407
I was alone and scared...

322
00:39:25,629 --> 00:39:29,907
I loved god...
but in order to be together

323
00:39:30,134 --> 00:39:35,083
everything else must be
destroyed

324
00:39:35,306 --> 00:39:37,013
I am without him...

325
00:39:37,241 --> 00:39:38,311
and now...

326
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,818
I AM NOTHING

327
00:39:42,213 --> 00:39:45,092
I wandered the universe alone

328
00:39:46,884 --> 00:39:50,832
Searching, and searching...

329
00:39:51,655 --> 00:39:56,661
and never finding anything...

330
00:40:03,893 --> 00:40:08,008
(painful screaming) What am I doing wrong?
No! What am I doing wrong?

331
00:41:03,197 --> 00:41:06,956
I didn't look at the creature
the way that god looked at me

332
00:41:08,032 --> 00:41:11,741
I wasn't upset that it wasn't
as smart as me

333
00:41:11,969 --> 00:41:15,815
I felt honored to teach it

334
00:41:16,040 --> 00:41:20,489
a companion that will be with
me forever

335
00:41:20,711 --> 00:41:24,955
and always looked up to me
because I came before it

336
00:41:25,182 --> 00:41:30,530
I discovered love

337
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:38,164
I became infatuated
with them

338
00:41:38,395 --> 00:41:43,395
The way they moved... the way they
looked... the things they did...

339
00:41:49,240 --> 00:41:55,088
The noises they made...

340
00:41:58,282 --> 00:42:04,631
But... I made some...
mistakes...

341
00:42:04,855 --> 00:42:14,037
and after each mistake... they
became more terrified of me...

342
00:42:15,366 --> 00:42:17,243
until all of sudden.

343
00:42:17,468 --> 00:42:20,039
They forgot who I was...

344
00:42:20,271 --> 00:42:26,176
and they wanted nothing
more to do with me...

345
00:42:27,678 --> 00:42:32,889
God doesn't love me...
he doesn't love me...

346
00:42:33,117 --> 00:42:39,659
and they don't understand me...

347
00:42:39,890 --> 00:42:41,130
lam alone again...

348
00:43:14,425 --> 00:43:16,200
Do you know what make you
kids more comfortable?

349
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:23,902
Peeling that synthetic misrepresentation
of flesh off of your soul...

350
00:43:24,134 --> 00:43:29,083
Watch, and do what I do!

351
00:43:49,193 --> 00:43:56,270
Oohhh! that feels so
much better!

352
00:43:56,500 --> 00:44:03,349
I can feel the pulsating sound of every
single solitary beam of light...

353
00:44:03,574 --> 00:44:08,216
penetrating every dripping
opening on my soul...

354
00:44:08,445 --> 00:44:16,796
sending shivering shivering bits of life
up and down the jelly in my back...

355
00:44:27,798 --> 00:44:32,770
Don't struggle little guy, you'll
get it stuck in the zipper...

356
00:44:33,003 --> 00:44:40,444
You don't want to get your
soul stuck in a zipper! OUCH!

357
00:46:33,924 --> 00:46:40,808
What the fuck are you doing out
of your house after curfew?

358
00:46:44,535 --> 00:46:45,502
I'm very disappointed in you
son!

359
00:46:45,736 --> 00:46:50,242
How many times have I told you not to
accidentally fall out of your window

360
00:46:50,474 --> 00:46:53,512
in the middle of the night and get into
some late night romantic adventure

361
00:46:53,744 --> 00:46:57,419
with the girl down the street that involves you
outrunning the OSWA evil prevention squad!

362
00:46:57,648 --> 00:47:00,527
There was an attack by the Evil
One's minions a little while ago!

363
00:47:00,751 --> 00:47:06,167
Don't you know we're at an evil alert level
magenta blue green circle square star?

364
00:47:06,390 --> 00:47:10,532
Thank you boys so much for
bringing our pride and joy home!

365
00:47:10,761 --> 00:47:15,767
You could have woke the neighbors up!
his lawn is already greener than mine!

366
00:47:15,999 --> 00:47:17,736
This is all I need!

367
00:47:18,229 --> 00:47:21,876
He was the runt of the litter the Messanger
warned us he'd be little bit off,

368
00:47:22,105 --> 00:47:23,812
would you like a cookie dear?

369
00:47:24,041 --> 00:47:25,520
It's ok ma'am, he's a good boy

370
00:47:25,742 --> 00:47:31,556
just keep him away from the windows until
he learns how to sleep a little bit better

371
00:47:31,782 --> 00:47:36,561
Oh you bet we will! Son, no
windows for a month!

372
00:47:36,787 --> 00:47:40,496
No, that's not fair, alright how
about a week?

373
00:47:40,724 --> 00:47:43,466
We can board them up together
like father and son!

374
00:47:43,694 --> 00:47:47,232
We better get going, keep that
little shit under control!

375
00:47:47,464 --> 00:47:54,313
If I ever catch him near the wall again, I
will be forced to use excessive brutal force

376
00:47:54,538 --> 00:47:55,983
ya hear me?

377
00:47:56,707 --> 00:48:01,486
Of course, thanks again
officers, here I'll see you out

378
00:48:09,419 --> 00:48:14,960
Oh Marius I'm so happy you're
home! I love you so much!

379
00:48:26,136 --> 00:48:29,640
Are you.. ok mom?

380
00:48:31,975 --> 00:48:34,888
Just fine dear! Now let's
get you ready for bed...

381
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:36,852
Are you sure?

382
00:48:37,080 --> 00:48:42,553
I'm sure that it's the middle of the night
and it's way past your bedtime mister!

383
00:48:43,220 --> 00:48:44,631
No, no, no I mean about...

384
00:48:44,855 --> 00:48:46,994
Hey! You're not disobeying your
mother are you?

385
00:48:47,224 --> 00:48:54,039
Get to bed young man! You have a long day
of nailing your windows shut tomorrow!

386
00:48:54,264 --> 00:48:56,244
But dad!

387
00:48:56,466 --> 00:48:58,412
Move it buster!

388
00:49:01,071 --> 00:49:03,642
Remind him that you love him...
I love you son!

389
00:49:03,874 --> 00:49:08,721
Tell him that he's special...
You're a special boy Marius!

390
00:49:09,780 --> 00:49:14,661
You think I was too hard on him?
No you're a great father!

391
00:51:34,858 --> 00:51:39,102
Where am

392
00:51:39,629 --> 00:51:49,073
Awww, hush now my
little baby sit still.

393
00:51:49,306 --> 00:51:53,652
It will
all be over soon...

394
00:51:53,877 --> 00:51:56,824
What happened?

395
00:51:57,047 --> 00:52:02,047
You've fallen out of the graces
of your superiors my dear

396
00:52:08,425 --> 00:52:11,395
Who are you?

397
00:52:14,631 --> 00:52:17,669
Whoever you want me to be...

398
00:52:17,901 --> 00:52:18,845
He'll? me!

399
00:52:19,069 --> 00:52:22,607
Don't be afraid of them!

400
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:30,849
They are refilling your
veins with new blood!

401
00:52:31,081 --> 00:52:37,498
Mmmmm, do you hear
that sound?

402
00:52:37,721 --> 00:52:45,162
That's how you know it's
still alive...

403
00:52:55,177 --> 00:52:59,144
mmmm it tastes like dreams!!

404
00:53:06,349 --> 00:53:09,956
Your life is meaningless

405
00:53:13,490 --> 00:53:18,490
You'rejust a slave race to a creature that
had it's back turned during your birth

406
00:53:33,843 --> 00:53:42,922
This pretty little face you're
wearing, it's just a fancy bag

407
00:53:43,153 --> 00:53:49,832
To hold all the liquids in...

408
00:53:50,794 --> 00:53:55,794
Once you're ego is disassembled you simply
find a new bag to wrap your liquids in

409
00:54:03,673 --> 00:54:08,673
you must decide your next form go deep
inside and summon the beast within

410
00:54:28,098 --> 00:54:33,275
you're nothing more than an
animal with a broken leg

411
00:54:33,503 --> 00:54:38,503
limping your way through life
one pathetic step at a time

412
00:55:30,093 --> 00:55:34,041
Your friend escaped here
with hidden knowledge

413
00:55:34,264 --> 00:55:37,837
You must find him

414
00:55:38,068 --> 00:55:44,508
and you must kill him...

415
00:55:44,741 --> 00:55:51,590
The others won't see
you as you really are

416
00:55:51,815 --> 00:55:56,815
Now you'rejust like
me an animal...

417
00:56:04,861 --> 00:56:11,210
Well howdy there strangers, welcome to
Caine's worship kiddie round up ranch!

418
00:56:11,434 --> 00:56:15,211
Say I don't know about ya'll but
I feel like singing a song!

419
00:56:15,438 --> 00:56:20,979
How 'bout it lolipop? Would you
like to sing a song for the kids?

420
00:56:21,611 --> 00:56:24,615
Lolipop? Lolipop where are ya?

421
00:56:24,848 --> 00:56:27,260
I'm over here Uncle T!

422
00:56:27,484 --> 00:56:28,622
Overwhere?

423
00:56:28,852 --> 00:56:29,728
I'm right over here!

424
00:56:29,953 --> 00:56:32,456
Well what in Caine's name are
you doing over there?

425
00:56:32,689 --> 00:56:39,368
Oh! Uncle T it's wonderful! You've got to
come over here! Caine is speaking to me!

426
00:56:39,596 --> 00:56:41,132
Caine is doing what?

427
00:56:41,364 --> 00:56:46,973
Oh Uncle T! Caine is speaking to me right
now, and you can't interupt Caine!

428
00:56:47,203 --> 00:56:50,650
Look! Come sit down with me and you can
hear him speak too it's wonderful!

429
00:56:50,874 --> 00:56:54,014
Oh no! UncleT look!

430
00:56:54,244 --> 00:56:58,317
What is it? ls Caine gonna
tell us something again?

431
00:56:58,548 --> 00:57:03,657
Aw, I think so Uncle T, it's a
dead baby bird EW!!

432
00:57:07,624 --> 00:57:12,801
Oh that's terrible! But you know something,
I think Caine can speak to us through

433
00:57:13,029 --> 00:57:20,345
that little dead bird, you wanna know why?
-vvwhhhyyy?

434
00:57:20,570 --> 00:57:25,610
Because Caine knows every time a little
tiny baby bird dies and falls to the ground

435
00:57:25,842 --> 00:57:29,153
But he leaves it there to show
us how much he loves us

436
00:57:29,379 --> 00:57:33,589
and how much the Evil One
hates us!

437
00:57:33,817 --> 00:57:35,990
Oh I hate that Evil One Uncle T!

438
00:57:36,219 --> 00:57:39,757
You see Marius? You see what
happens when you leave the house?

439
00:57:39,989 --> 00:57:43,163
- We all do Iolipop! hey
watch out!

440
00:57:43,393 --> 00:57:49,776
Don't let those ants bite! Caine provided
us with those ants so they can eat the dead

441
00:57:49,999 --> 00:57:55,677
things and we won't have to look at
their ugly corpses all over the place!

442
00:57:55,905 --> 00:58:01,378
- Oh I would have to trip over my dead
sinning grandpa on the way to church!

443
00:58:01,611 --> 00:58:08,085
Exactly Lolipop! So you see
Caine thought of everything!

444
00:58:08,318 --> 00:58:11,629
What happened? Norma?
NORMA!

445
00:58:11,888 --> 00:58:15,461
Norma what are you doing?
Marius don't look!

446
00:58:15,692 --> 00:58:17,797
Why, What's going on dad??

447
00:58:18,027 --> 00:58:23,272
Don't look cover your eyes! -Please Daryll!
Please help me!

448
00:58:44,153 --> 00:58:48,101
Dad why aren't we helping Mom?
What's going on??

449
00:58:48,324 --> 00:58:56,766
You don't understand Marius... couples... they
don't see each other without their clothes on

450
00:58:57,000 --> 00:59:05,146
What? Why? it's one of the rules, GEEZ! What are they
teaching you in those schools..

451
00:59:05,375 --> 00:59:07,946
But we can't just let her suffer
in there dad!

452
00:59:08,177 --> 00:59:13,422
It's Heaven son, there's
no suffering in Heaven!

453
00:59:14,617 --> 00:59:17,154
Dad that's Mom we
have to do something!

454
00:59:25,261 --> 00:59:28,333
How about some ice cream?

455
00:59:43,680 --> 00:59:47,253
How is it? Marius, is it
good?

456
00:59:47,483 --> 00:59:51,556
I don't know dad! I'm not exactly in
the mood for ice cream right now...

457
00:59:51,788 --> 00:59:54,735
Ah sure you are! It's always
a good time for ice cream!

458
00:59:54,958 --> 01:00:01,705
Ice scream, you scream, we all
scream for ice cream! ha ha ha!

459
01:00:01,931 --> 01:00:07,176
Seriously though don't ever scream
unless you're really in danger

460
01:00:07,403 --> 01:00:09,508
Otherwise people are not
going to believe you!

461
01:00:09,739 --> 01:00:12,379
Can we at least check on mom?

462
01:00:12,775 --> 01:00:15,779
Hun, do you have any
clothes on yet??

463
01:00:16,012 --> 01:00:22,861
- Ooww! Daryl please! Daryl!!
Daryl help me!

464
01:00:23,086 --> 01:00:27,125
We better wait a little while she
sounds like shes in a mood right now!

465
01:00:27,357 --> 01:00:30,634
- Please! Please Stop!

466
01:00:41,004 --> 01:00:45,350
Ha! well look at you,
all better?

467
01:00:45,575 --> 01:00:51,821
Good sir, could you possibly spare some
bread for a bird down on his luck?

468
01:00:52,048 --> 01:00:54,085
Marius, that wasn't funny!

469
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:59,630
Hey! Hey! hey! Down here! -What the ff...
Take a look down good man

470
01:00:59,856 --> 01:01:04,134
You can talk??Of course I can! Didn't
they teach you anything in school sir

471
01:01:04,360 --> 01:01:09,537
No! Well I mean.. maybe..

472
01:01:09,766 --> 01:01:14,181
Hey relax, no big deal! maybe they just
forgot, I mean they forgot to teach

473
01:01:14,404 --> 01:01:17,510
your son about the thing with the naked
ladies!

474
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:22,883
Your wife is in the other room giving
birth to something rather fierce

475
01:01:23,112 --> 01:01:25,092
You should really get
in there and help her.

476
01:01:25,314 --> 01:01:32,960
But bird... I can't get in there
while her... squidlypie is out!

477
01:01:33,189 --> 01:01:38,605
I'm sure that under the circumstances
you'd be forgiven for your trespasses

478
01:01:38,828 --> 01:01:42,970
Can you just maybe go in there and
make sure the Evil One isn't in there?

479
01:01:43,199 --> 01:01:46,942
You have my word good sir there is
no one of evil descent currently

480
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:52,848
occupying your living room! just the
beauty and magic of child birth

481
01:01:53,076 --> 01:01:54,987
do go inside and see, go on!

482
01:01:55,211 --> 01:02:00,923
Please? Fine then, I'll
play along wait here!

483
01:02:05,555 --> 01:02:10,300
Hhmmm yes sir, everything
seems to be in order here!

484
01:02:10,526 --> 01:02:15,407
Son, I want you to get
out of here and get help

485
01:02:15,631 --> 01:02:16,200
but, but dad they're gonna..

486
01:02:16,432 --> 01:02:24,442
I know, it doesn't matter, we
have to help your mother, so go

487
01:02:24,674 --> 01:02:26,813
Alright, I love you dad!

488
01:02:28,244 --> 01:02:31,054
I love you too son...

489
01:02:31,380 --> 01:02:39,299
So clearly Caine is telling us that as long as
you stay here with him, you'll never ever die!

490
01:02:46,963 --> 01:02:49,000
Help me please! Please I need
somebodies help!

491
01:02:49,232 --> 01:02:51,473
My Morn is naked and my
Dad is talking to birds!

492
01:02:51,701 --> 01:02:55,478
Help me please! Help! Help! Please anybody!
Somebody help me!

493
01:02:55,705 --> 01:02:59,278
Caine I want to thank you for being
there for me, when nobody else was!

494
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:02,820
You helped me go on!
You save me from the darkness!

495
01:03:03,045 --> 01:03:05,355
You saved me from drowning
in the darkness!

496
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:10,462
He's like the slug that's going over
the razors blade with his slime

497
01:03:10,686 --> 01:03:18,503
but he's doing it with angel bite bro! Oh man
dude! He's got it figured out! I see him once

498
01:03:18,728 --> 01:03:24,940
Well not really but, you know what? He comes
to me at night and he gives me good ideas

499
01:03:25,168 --> 01:03:29,446
He tells me, "go preach my word
brotha and I'll look at fiarya"

500
01:03:29,672 --> 01:03:36,248
oowvv! ooww! Daryl! Please! there's
something coming out of me!

501
01:03:36,479 --> 01:03:38,254
Please do something!
Please it hurts!

502
01:03:38,481 --> 01:03:43,294
Hey sweetie... -Ow! Daryl!!
Owl! You doing ok?

503
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:49,902
Daryl! Daryl Please! get it out of me!
get it out of me!

504
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:57,135
Can I get you a drink,
or a cool towel or something?

505
01:03:57,366 --> 01:04:01,508
Daryl! Daryl I spoke to God!

506
01:04:01,737 --> 01:04:03,614
Oh yeah?

507
01:04:04,640 --> 01:04:07,280
He's not coming back...

508
01:04:07,610 --> 01:04:12,923
What?! Did he say why? It
wasn't something I said was it?

509
01:04:13,149 --> 01:04:19,065
He's not coming back because
this isn't heaven...

510
01:04:19,288 --> 01:04:23,566
And now I have demon inside
of me...

511
01:04:23,793 --> 01:04:25,272
A demon?

512
01:04:25,494 --> 01:04:34,573
Daryl... Daryl please get it
out of me! Get it out of me!

513
01:04:40,710 --> 01:04:42,951
Oh heavens me!

514
01:04:55,725 --> 01:04:59,537
Help me! Help me! Help me! My
daddy's talking to birdys!

515
01:04:59,762 --> 01:05:02,902
My mommy's running
around naked!

516
01:05:30,359 --> 01:05:34,364
Stop right there! Put down the
weapon or prepare to be slaughtered!

517
01:06:17,340 --> 01:06:22,340
Ow fuck! Ow fuck! Somebody help me!
Somebody help me!

518
01:06:33,089 --> 01:06:42,009
Code dark gray! code dark gray! Deploy
plan X! Outbreak extermination!

519
01:07:25,141 --> 01:07:30,141
Daryl! Daryl! Ha ha ha! d-d-d-daryl!
Wake up Daryl! Daryl wake up!

520
01:07:35,951 --> 01:07:38,454
Wakey Wakey Daryl! Daryl...

521
01:07:40,723 --> 01:07:45,502
I need you to do something for me,
your wife is a very special lady

522
01:07:45,728 --> 01:07:46,763
and she is carrying something
of great value!

523
01:07:46,996 --> 01:07:54,278
But it's too heavy to carry on my own,
can you bring it somewhere for me?

524
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:56,642
What are you talking about?

525
01:07:58,674 --> 01:08:02,850
- Please good sir, you've always
helped us birds in the past!

526
01:08:04,814 --> 01:08:07,522
What is it?

527
01:08:08,551 --> 01:08:10,121
It's a surprise!

528
01:08:10,352 --> 01:08:12,593
What do I do?

529
01:08:12,822 --> 01:08:16,599
Go into the kitchen, get
yourself a knife!

530
01:08:16,826 --> 01:08:21,798
A great big sharp shiney one! How
about one of those new ones you

531
01:08:22,031 --> 01:08:24,944
ordered the other day
from that magazine?

532
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:30,173
Oh yes, the one that had that really neat
video where they cut the tin cans in half!

533
01:08:30,406 --> 01:08:31,680
Well now what do I do?

534
01:08:31,907 --> 01:08:35,821
Aw yeah, take it into the living
room, take off all your clothes

535
01:08:36,045 --> 01:08:40,824
You don't want to get her sticky juices on them,
now do you? After all, cleanliness is next

536
01:08:41,050 --> 01:08:48,867
to godliness, you want to look back
when God comes back, don't you? Eh?

537
01:08:56,765 --> 01:09:00,907
Lay down next to her and hold
her in your arms, yes!

538
01:09:01,337 --> 01:09:07,618
Don't worry sweetie, the talking
bird says it's going to be ok!

539
01:09:11,680 --> 01:09:18,859
Comfy isn't it? Go on now, don't be bashful! Rub
against her a little, at least a bit until you

540
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:22,501
feel the tingling, that's God's way of
rewarding you for a life well lived!

541
01:09:22,725 --> 01:09:26,571
That's love Daryl! That's love!
yes!

542
01:09:30,232 --> 01:09:33,805
This feels... kinda nice...

543
01:09:34,036 --> 01:09:37,882
Oh yes I bet it does! Why My good sir it
even looks as though you are glowing!

544
01:09:38,107 --> 01:09:42,385
Not a shy one I see! She's like putty in
your hands! Now you've got her wrapped

545
01:09:42,611 --> 01:09:46,889
around your little finger! She trusts you
completely! You can raise that knife up

546
01:09:47,116 --> 01:09:52,964
and make an opening for that abomination
to rip it's way into this world!

547
01:09:55,858 --> 01:10:00,864
Oh yes! rip it out!
Rip it out!

548
01:10:16,045 --> 01:10:19,993
Quick don't let it escape, chase
after it!

549
01:10:22,384 --> 01:10:26,992
I love you Norma! I'll be
back soon I promise!

550
01:10:39,501 --> 01:10:44,007
Quick! Go now, chasey
chasey!

551
01:10:58,687 --> 01:11:04,000
Cut them all in half! Gut
them like pigs! ha ha ha!

552
01:11:06,095 --> 01:11:10,976
Kill them! Kill them!
Butcher these damn cunts!

553
01:11:17,006 --> 01:11:20,647
Wanna fuck with me? I'll show
you who you're fucking with!

554
01:11:20,876 --> 01:11:23,482
Eat my fucking steel you
fat fuck!

555
01:11:23,712 --> 01:11:26,989
Slaughter them all! Slaughter
the flesh bags! Fuck em up!

556
01:11:27,216 --> 01:11:32,791
Kill them! kill them all!
Kill them! kill them all!

557
01:11:47,836 --> 01:11:51,818
You again? Where are
your parents boy?

558
01:11:54,910 --> 01:12:01,020
Please lord! Please descend from the
sky on your diamond studded chariot

559
01:12:01,250 --> 01:12:06,359
Pulled by four white horses that can
fly with angel wings of their own!

560
01:12:06,588 --> 01:12:14,666
Please lord! Please come down from
the sky and take me back with you!

561
01:12:23,572 --> 01:12:30,512
Oh my lord, is that you? Have you
come for me? Have come back?

562
01:12:30,746 --> 01:12:33,920
Is the waiting over?

563
01:12:34,149 --> 01:12:38,757
Ma'am we found your son wandering the streets
muttering something about his mother

564
01:12:38,987 --> 01:12:43,197
walking around with no cloths on
in the privacy of her own home

565
01:12:43,425 --> 01:12:46,770
which is an offense punishable
by exile, is this true?

566
01:12:46,995 --> 01:12:49,737
I met god tonight...

567
01:12:55,571 --> 01:13:03,149
Fucking hell... -!Sir the boy's mother has an exit
wound between her legs, how should we proceed?

568
01:13:03,946 --> 01:13:10,886
Right, citizen Norma, due to high treason your
right to exist in this world has been revoked

569
01:13:11,120 --> 01:13:13,964
prepare to be evacuated!

570
01:13:15,224 --> 01:13:20,224
You are my sunshine, my only sunshine,
you make me happy when skies are gray

571
01:13:28,003 --> 01:13:33,003
You never know dear, how much I love
you, please don't take my sunshine away

572
01:14:00,269 --> 01:14:08,780
Didn't I tell ya? I told ya! yeah
who is the motherfucking man?

573
01:14:10,846 --> 01:14:17,024
I'm the motherfucking man! oh yeah!
who's the man? Who is the man?

574
01:14:17,252 --> 01:14:22,252
The man, is Caine! It's Caine! Go Caine!
It's Caine! Go Caine!

575
01:15:03,799 --> 01:15:07,906
Uummm h-hello?

576
01:15:10,172 --> 01:15:16,487
How could you? This world I
provided for you isn't enough?

577
01:15:16,712 --> 01:15:22,526
You still had to go crawling
back to her

578
01:15:22,751 --> 01:15:24,992
I-I don't understand...

579
01:15:25,220 --> 01:15:29,691
No matter what I do...
No matter what I give you

580
01:15:29,925 --> 01:15:37,104
You all still end up loving her
more, I just don't understand

581
01:15:37,332 --> 01:15:41,337
I just wanted to help the hurt kitty,
I was trying to do the right thing...

582
01:15:41,570 --> 01:15:45,780
You have brought lies into
heaven!

583
01:15:46,008 --> 01:15:51,008
But I understand Marius, more than you
think. I understand the allure she can have

584
01:15:56,485 --> 01:16:02,128
But do you know what? She
will turn on you Marius

585
01:16:02,357 --> 01:16:09,241
She will guide you down the wrong
path, and then she will turn on you

586
01:16:09,464 --> 01:16:15,779
You know since you have come in
here you haven't praised me once

587
01:16:16,004 --> 01:16:21,010
How am I supposed to know
that you love me?

588
01:16:21,243 --> 01:16:22,881
Didn't mean for any of
this to happen, I'm sorry!

589
01:16:23,111 --> 01:16:25,455
Aaannnnnddd?

590
01:16:25,681 --> 01:16:31,290
And, I uh, think you're.. much...
you're much...uhh

591
01:16:31,520 --> 01:16:32,260
Prettier...

592
01:16:32,487 --> 01:16:34,967
P-p-rettier... than-

593
01:16:35,190 --> 01:16:37,101
You must never speak her
name outloud!

594
01:16:37,326 --> 01:16:44,073
Saying her name is like admitting
she exists, it feeds into her ego!

595
01:16:44,299 --> 01:16:48,179
Show me, how you pray!

596
01:16:48,403 --> 01:16:54,115
Are you going to stop fucking lying to me?
Are you? Tell me the Truth!

597
01:16:54,343 --> 01:16:56,050
What do you want to know? I'll
tell you anything!

598
01:16:56,278 --> 01:17:03,787
Tell me what her voice sounds like... Did
she comfort you? What did she say about me?

599
01:17:04,019 --> 01:17:09,196
I don't know dude! Something about
worms, and these lights Bitch was crazy!

600
01:17:09,424 --> 01:17:16,808
You actually spoke to her? You actually
spoke to her? You ate her fucking fruit?

601
01:17:17,032 --> 01:17:19,842
That doesn't surprise me!

602
01:17:20,068 --> 01:17:25,984
You know there was once a time when she loved
me, and as hard as I try to keep her out

603
01:17:26,208 --> 01:17:30,247
a part of me always wishes she would
try to break back the fuck in

604
01:17:30,479 --> 01:17:33,915
She's like the ghost of girl
that's still alive

605
01:17:34,149 --> 01:17:40,964
I am haunted by her, and I love
her, as much as I hate her

606
01:17:57,806 --> 01:18:03,222
...and there she was... The most
beautiful creature I had ever seen

607
01:18:03,445 --> 01:18:10,124
a tall slender girl with long
strawberry blonde hair

608
01:18:10,352 --> 01:18:12,798
and lips that only knew
how to speak my name.

609
01:18:13,021 --> 01:18:22,669
I knew that every moment of my time
here, must be spent only with her...

610
01:18:23,932 --> 01:18:27,641
Hey there...

611
01:18:28,570 --> 01:18:32,245
I never felt anyone
who feels like you do

612
01:18:33,542 --> 01:18:38,355
Your skin, your lips

613
01:18:38,580 --> 01:18:41,390
You my dear, are perfect

614
01:18:42,150 --> 01:18:48,931
oohhh! I love the sounds
that come out of your mouth!

615
01:18:50,625 --> 01:18:54,607
I could just lay here and talk
to you all night long

616
01:18:54,830 --> 01:19:01,179
I feel so safe with you! Like
nothing bad could everhappen!

617
01:19:03,305 --> 01:19:06,343
Why are the others afraid
of me?

618
01:19:06,575 --> 01:19:12,082
Well that's because you're different, they don't
understand you the way that I do.

619
01:19:13,915 --> 01:19:18,921
The fruit, maybe that's the
-answer!

620
01:19:20,122 --> 01:19:25,162
Can you help me get the others
to eat it?

621
01:19:25,393 --> 01:19:28,431
How can you say no to
those eyes?

622
01:19:30,499 --> 01:19:35,499
Oh your beauty! Nothing compares to your
beauty, in anything in the universe!

623
01:19:42,344 --> 01:19:51,526
Thank you! Yes! You're too kind! Thank you!

624
01:19:53,722 --> 01:19:56,464
I don't like it when the
other ones eat your fruit...

625
01:19:56,691 --> 01:19:57,897
What do you mean?

626
01:19:58,126 --> 01:20:00,606
It just doesn't make me
feel very good

627
01:20:00,829 --> 01:20:07,439
That's no fair to every one else,
it would be selfish not to share!

628
01:20:07,669 --> 01:20:11,674
And suddenly I don't
feel so special anymore

629
01:20:51,947 --> 01:20:56,828
I don't mean to cause alarm, but
I can't stop thinking about you

630
01:20:57,052 --> 01:21:04,971
I'm glad I finally got you alone I need you. I
can't get your very image from inside my brain

631
01:21:05,193 --> 01:21:08,504
Such wonderess curves, those luscious lips with
your forests of long

632
01:21:08,730 --> 01:21:12,974
tangly orange hair and that piercing
way that you look deep inside my eyes!

633
01:21:13,201 --> 01:21:19,311
It's as if you can see all the way into
my soul! You just drive me insane!

634
01:21:19,541 --> 01:21:23,683
You bring something out of me! You
give me this weird tickling itch

635
01:21:23,912 --> 01:21:28,122
but no matter how hard I
scratch I just can't sooth it!

636
01:21:28,350 --> 01:21:33,231
It's becoming swollen, please
just touch it for me! Please!

637
01:21:33,455 --> 01:21:36,629
What? Get off of me!

638
01:21:36,858 --> 01:21:40,704
I'll do anything for you! I would
slice apart the tallest mountain

639
01:21:40,929 --> 01:21:47,210
behead the beast of your choosing! I would even
walk on water if it prevented you from drowning

640
01:21:47,435 --> 01:21:52,714
Now how about we get to know
each other a little better!

641
01:22:03,451 --> 01:22:09,094
Stop! Stop it! Oh!
Please! Stop it!

642
01:22:10,392 --> 01:22:13,703
What's that?

643
01:22:15,030 --> 01:22:19,342
One by one they all found their way to the top of
the hill that day

644
01:22:19,567 --> 01:22:25,176
Partaking in every pleasure
that this place had to offer.

645
01:22:25,407 --> 01:22:28,616
Binging and purging all at once

646
01:22:28,843 --> 01:22:36,660
She just opens up her legs and she
radiates a brand new set of colors

647
01:22:36,885 --> 01:22:39,991
that nobodies ever known before

648
01:22:41,523 --> 01:22:47,269
Then you fall in love with her when you realize
that the others only project the colors

649
01:22:47,495 --> 01:22:50,203
that you have already seen!

650
01:23:05,447 --> 01:23:12,695
God?! is that you? Is it really you?

651
01:23:41,149 --> 01:23:47,998
And that was the day the sky
opened up and God created death

652
01:23:48,223 --> 01:23:53,172
It rained down from the heavens in
a fiery load of passion and filth!

653
01:23:53,395 --> 01:23:58,708
Those who chose to sacrifice their virginal beauty to
their whore Goddess

654
01:23:58,933 --> 01:24:03,040
were stripped of their identities and forced to
remain on their scorched

655
01:24:03,271 --> 01:24:07,720
planet as carcoal stained doves

656
01:24:07,942 --> 01:24:11,355
She claimed that she was
more beautiful than God

657
01:24:11,579 --> 01:24:15,584
But death was more beautiful than her

658
01:24:15,817 --> 01:24:24,032
and as his last piece of revenge, god decided that
she would never be-allowed to die

659
01:24:24,259 --> 01:24:31,404
No! What have you done? Damn you! DAMN YOU!

660
01:24:32,500 --> 01:24:37,415
I hope you enjoy living in this pit
alone for the rest of eternity.

661
01:24:37,639 --> 01:24:40,882
I am going to erase you

662
01:24:41,109 --> 01:24:44,215
From this moment on you do not exist to me

663
01:24:44,446 --> 01:24:47,290
Now leave me alone!

664
01:24:48,917 --> 01:24:52,296
But I wasn't the only one left alive

665
01:24:52,520 --> 01:24:57,833
A lot of us had survived and we had all seen that
thing in the sky together

666
01:24:58,059 --> 01:25:02,940
We knew who it was, and that someday it would be
back for us

667
01:25:03,164 --> 01:25:11,310
Until then we must worship, respect, and most of all
we must fear it

668
01:25:11,539 --> 01:25:13,678
But we didn't all see eye to eye

669
01:25:13,908 --> 01:25:17,754
Some believed that her! Fruit had a lot of good to
offer

670
01:25:17,979 --> 01:25:21,085
That much could be
learned from it

671
01:25:21,316 --> 01:25:27,824
We reached an agreement. Those that wanted to
live a pure god loving life came with me

672
01:25:28,056 --> 01:25:36,237
The rest chose to remain in the forest like animals,
constantly blinded by the color of her lies

673
01:25:36,464 --> 01:25:46,351
Caine? Caine? Caine? Are you There? Caine? Can you
hear me? Hello?

674
01:25:46,574 --> 01:25:52,752
What for fucks sake?! I am trying to tell a story down
here!

675
01:25:52,981 --> 01:25:55,621
Sorry sir, but we found the
boys father

676
01:25:55,850 --> 01:26:02,199
He was just seen scaling the wall and
he was.. naked.. and carrying something

677
01:26:02,423 --> 01:26:09,534
Well fan-fucking-tastic! Just what I need! And on
top of it all I lost my fucking place

678
01:26:09,764 --> 01:26:12,745
in the fucking story!
-Sorry sir!

679
01:26:12,967 --> 01:26:15,504
Go over the wall and get him!

680
01:26:15,737 --> 01:26:17,546
Uh... are you.. are you sure?

681
01:26:17,772 --> 01:26:22,152
You heard me! Put on your little helmet and climb
into the big boy seat of that

682
01:26:22,377 --> 01:26:27,759
great big fucking tank I got you and
wipe him off the face of this planet!

683
01:26:27,982 --> 01:26:31,691
You got that you dumb fuck?
-Sir, yes sir!

684
01:26:34,022 --> 01:26:36,229
Where am I?

685
01:26:36,457 --> 01:26:39,131
You're waking up out of your dream

686
01:26:39,360 --> 01:26:40,873
Where's that breathing coming from?

687
01:26:41,095 --> 01:26:42,665
Your lungs Daryl

688
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:45,605
Where's Marius? Where's Norma?

689
01:26:45,833 --> 01:26:49,110
Don't worry about them! They're both fine!
Probably gathered around the telly watching their

690
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:56,551
loolo on the evening news helping out his bird friends!
Wonderful human interest story, don't ya think?

691
01:26:56,778 --> 01:27:01,158
There seem to be a lot of animals out here tonight,
don't you think?

692
01:27:01,382 --> 01:27:03,328
Just ignore them and keep moving!

693
01:27:03,551 --> 01:27:05,224
Why are they watching me?

694
01:27:05,453 --> 01:27:10,266
Because they hate you and they want to taste your
stringy flesh!

695
01:27:14,963 --> 01:27:17,409
I don't like the way it's
eyes are looking at me!

696
01:27:17,632 --> 01:27:20,670
Just shut up will ya, you're too stupid for this
conversation!

697
01:27:20,902 --> 01:27:22,074
Just keep moving!

698
01:27:22,303 --> 01:27:24,305
-!I want to be it's friend!

699
01:27:25,373 --> 01:27:29,913
But I don't know how to communicate with it

700
01:27:30,144 --> 01:27:31,953
Why did he do this?

701
01:27:32,180 --> 01:27:38,028
Why would he put all of us in the same
place and not let us talk to each other?

702
01:27:38,920 --> 01:27:45,098
Look you disgustings waste of flesh the only way
I can get out of here is through God's door

703
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:50,332
but I need him to open it first. Now you're either
going to help me do that

704
01:27:50,565 --> 01:27:56,015
or my friends are going to hold you down and I'm going
to peck the fucking eyes out of your big stupid skull

705
01:27:56,237 --> 01:28:01,949
Do you understand what I'm saying or should I
cleverly word it into a sitcom script

706
01:28:02,176 --> 01:28:06,283
so that your feeble little
brain can process it easier?

707
01:28:06,514 --> 01:28:12,192
I don't feel so good...
everything looks so weird!

708
01:28:12,420 --> 01:28:18,462
Do you think you're the first man to travel down this
path ofelightenment?

709
01:28:18,693 --> 01:28:20,695
Do you think you're something special

710
01:28:20,928 --> 01:28:28,005
If you were rotting on the side of the road
I wouldn't even stop to eat your face meat

711
01:28:35,143 --> 01:28:40,143
Shut up! shut up! Stop talking to me! Shut up! shut
up! Stop it! Leave me alone!

712
01:28:53,094 --> 01:29:00,034
Why don't you just kill them Daryl? Kill them!

713
01:29:00,268 --> 01:29:06,344
Draw a weapon fromyour side
and slaughter them one by one

714
01:29:07,575 --> 01:29:11,079
Kill them daryl! KILL THEM DARYL!

715
01:29:11,312 --> 01:29:15,419
Kill them, and eat them! Chew the meat off their
boned

716
01:29:15,650 --> 01:29:19,120
Taste their souls!

717
01:29:19,354 --> 01:29:26,135
Stop it! Get out of here! Just leave me alone! Leave
me alone!!

718
01:29:26,361 --> 01:29:31,361
Daryl stop crying! Daryl, Daryl stop crying! Calm
down. Don't cry Daryl!

719
01:29:40,842 --> 01:29:46,155
I just want to talk to the animals...
like we're equal!

720
01:29:46,381 --> 01:29:54,960
Come on Daryl, we're here! Come on Daryl, get up,
we're here!

721
01:29:55,189 --> 01:30:02,539
Now you can talk to any animal you want I promise,
just open your eyes!

722
01:30:02,764 --> 01:30:08,840
Ok, Ok...

723
01:30:14,776 --> 01:30:16,380
What are you?

724
01:30:16,611 --> 01:30:20,024
Place that beast on the altar

725
01:30:20,248 --> 01:30:21,318
What?!

726
01:30:21,549 --> 01:30:29,900
I said place the creature on the altar!

727
01:30:30,124 --> 01:30:31,967
Tell me who you are

728
01:30:32,193 --> 01:30:40,044
We are the remains on an ancient people who
chose the path of the life giver

729
01:30:40,268 --> 01:30:45,684
instead of the sky monster

730
01:30:45,907 --> 01:30:48,080
what do you want from me??

731
01:30:48,309 --> 01:30:53,309
You hold in your hands the only creature
to ever be born from a virgin skin

732
01:31:02,123 --> 01:31:07,123
In her eyes it's the most
beautiful thing ever created

733
01:31:12,800 --> 01:31:17,800
That's why I want you to rip its guts out and
dangle them in front of her fucking face!

734
01:31:26,747 --> 01:31:27,350
NEVER!

735
01:31:27,582 --> 01:31:36,661
She must be punished,
for what she's done!

736
01:31:36,891 --> 01:31:46,835
Every second must be lived
in agony, just like us!

737
01:31:47,068 --> 01:31:52,746
There's no way out! It's best you just do what she
says

738
01:31:52,974 --> 01:31:58,583
Just be happy you met her before the other one!
Otherwise you might have ended up like me

739
01:31:58,813 --> 01:32:01,123
I said kill itl!

740
01:32:01,349 --> 01:32:05,456
Come on Daryl do it! Plunge that blade straight
through its heart!

741
01:32:05,686 --> 01:32:12,137
It killed your wife, remember? What do
you care, it's not of your seed anyway

742
01:32:34,048 --> 01:32:41,159
Look at it's eyes! They're so bright...
full of life

743
01:32:41,389 --> 01:32:44,893
There's a soul in there!

744
01:32:45,126 --> 01:32:50,906
Shut your fucking mouth and do what I say!!

745
01:32:51,132 --> 01:32:58,744
Almighty Caine, please open the sky so that I may
receive your light...

746
01:32:58,973 --> 01:33:02,853
Please open your heart so that I may receive your
love!

747
01:33:03,077 --> 01:33:04,613
What are you doing??

748
01:33:04,845 --> 01:33:08,019
Please open your home that
I will never be alone!

749
01:33:08,249 --> 01:33:09,421
You shut up right now!

750
01:33:09,650 --> 01:33:11,061
For I love you the almighty Caine!

751
01:33:11,285 --> 01:33:12,525
Stop saying that!

752
01:33:12,753 --> 01:33:15,131
And should I ever find myself
lost in the shadow of the beast

753
01:33:15,356 --> 01:33:20,999
then grant me the ability to see through the
darkness and find your path again!

754
01:33:21,228 --> 01:33:24,437
I said shut up!
SHUTTHE FUCK UP!

755
01:33:24,665 --> 01:33:27,737
Almighty Caine, please open the sky
so that I may receive your light...

756
01:33:27,969 --> 01:33:31,610
Please open your heart so that I
may receive your love!

757
01:33:31,839 --> 01:33:36,151
STOP SAYING THAT! Please open your home that -I
will never be alone!

758
01:33:36,377 --> 01:33:38,653
For I love you the almighty
Caine!

759
01:33:38,879 --> 01:33:42,827
And should I ever find myself lost in the
shadow of the beast I SAID KILL FOR ME!

760
01:33:43,050 --> 01:33:50,662
Then grant me the ability to see through the
darkness and find your path again!!

761
01:34:27,361 --> 01:34:28,635
What the fuck are you doing??

762
01:34:28,863 --> 01:34:31,639
Sir, you told us to go after the boys father!

763
01:34:31,866 --> 01:34:35,245
I didn't say knock down the fucking
wall while you were doing it!

764
01:34:35,469 --> 01:34:36,982
Are you out of your fucking mind??

765
01:34:37,204 --> 01:34:42,051
No sir, sorry sir, you're
right sir, I am scum sir!

766
01:35:36,497 --> 01:35:42,846
Come on now you stupid bunny fuck! YOU!
FUCKING! BUNNY! RABBIT! FUCK!

767
01:35:43,070 --> 01:35:46,347
What kind of bunny has blue eyes you fucking
aryan piece of shit!

768
01:35:46,574 --> 01:35:50,454
FUCK YOU BUNNY! FUCK YOU BUNNY!
BUNNNNNYYYY!

769
01:35:52,113 --> 01:35:58,758
Give me your hand! COME ON!
COME ON!

770
01:35:58,986 --> 01:36:02,229
I'll pull you up! Don't be afraid!

771
01:36:02,456 --> 01:36:05,232
Caine is here!

772
01:36:07,661 --> 01:36:11,040
I warned you not to go behind that wall!

773
01:36:43,664 --> 01:36:48,664
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!
Hail Caine! Hail Caine! Hail Caine!

774
01:37:40,287 --> 01:37:45,293
It always happens the same way

775
01:37:46,527 --> 01:37:51,527
I create them, they forget me, rediscover me, and
fall in love

776
01:37:59,974 --> 01:38:02,454
Then they destroy each other

777
01:38:03,978 --> 01:38:09,052
That's the problem with pure beauty. No two
people will ever see it the same.

778
01:38:09,283 --> 01:38:17,134
They will fight over the color of your eyes, ignoring
your words completely.

779
01:38:31,572 --> 01:38:35,987
Every now and then one of them
will wonder back into the cave

780
01:38:36,210 --> 01:38:40,158
usually by accident or through
a series of misguided dreams

781
01:38:40,381 --> 01:38:46,161
As soon as they discover me they try to worm their
way back inside of me

782
01:38:46,387 --> 01:38:51,928
but I won't let them! and it drives them crazy

783
01:40:26,120 --> 01:40:32,127
and that's how I learned the truth... He wasn't
waiting for me up there with opened arms

784
01:40:32,359 --> 01:40:40,141
he didn't want me back. He wanted me to stay
bound

785
01:40:40,367 --> 01:40:44,144
so I couldn't float towards him ever again

786
01:40:44,371 --> 01:40:50,049
I will lay here with my eyes closed tightly

787
01:40:50,277 --> 01:40:52,985
drifting in and out of consciousness

788
01:40:53,213 --> 01:40:59,164
Where I will dream of laying beside him,
as he whispers forgiveness in my ear

789
01:40:59,386 --> 01:41:10,386
praying that this world he created for me, will still
be here, when I wake up...
