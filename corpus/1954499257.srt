1
00:00:39,341 --> 00:00:40,579
You need some help, man?

2
00:00:40,750 --> 00:00:42,567
Oh, God.

3
00:00:42,568 --> 00:00:43,648
I don't care.

4
00:00:43,687 --> 00:00:46,393
You wanna mess up your own shit?

5
00:00:46,434 --> 00:00:48,436
But you're gonna mess up mine, too.

6
00:00:49,338 --> 00:00:51,242
I need to know, you got my back.

7
00:00:51,285 --> 00:00:53,135
You're gonna come fall in' through the door behind me.

8
00:00:53,136 --> 00:00:56,445
Don't worry your pretty little spick head off.

9
00:00:59,295 --> 00:01:02,613
Anyway, that was all I wanted to say.

10
00:01:02,614 --> 00:01:03,916
Is that it?

11
00:01:05,877 --> 00:01:08,219
- But now I know.
- Fuck you!

12
00:01:18,673 --> 00:01:19,457
Scudder.

13
00:02:03,041 --> 00:02:04,779
[Speaking Spanish]

14
00:02:09,593 --> 00:02:13,772
Okay, get out. Both of you.
I told you last night...

15
00:05:44,427 --> 00:05:45,900
Hey, Matt.

16
00:05:47,286 --> 00:05:48,482
It's me, Peter.

17
00:05:50,414 --> 00:05:53,073
- You know, Peter Kristo.
- Oh, Peter. Right.

18
00:05:54,622 --> 00:05:55,846
Do I know you, Peter?

19
00:05:56,210 --> 00:05:59,596
Yeah, I was at a meeting few weeks ago.

20
00:06:00,600 --> 00:06:04,425
I'm a painter. Got hook on smack
and all the school...

21
00:06:04,426 --> 00:06:07,265
Oh, yeah. You're the guy
that did the Jackson Pollack

22
00:06:07,295 --> 00:06:10,164
number on the wall of the john
with the blood from your-

23
00:06:10,165 --> 00:06:11,293
Syringe. Yeah.

24
00:06:11,580 --> 00:06:12,335
Yeah, it was me.

25
00:06:12,336 --> 00:06:16,008
Enjoyed your story. Oh, thanks.
Appreciate it. -

26
00:06:17,604 --> 00:06:20,761
- Do you mind?
- Sure.

27
00:06:22,306 --> 00:06:24,188
No smoking here, honey.

28
00:06:25,718 --> 00:06:27,456
- Something wrong, Peter?
- Ahh...

29
00:06:28,874 --> 00:06:32,176
It's with my brother, you know.
He needs your help.

30
00:06:32,846 --> 00:06:34,154
What can I help?

31
00:06:35,749 --> 00:06:37,586
I think it's better you came up to Clinton Hill.

32
00:06:37,616 --> 00:06:39,483
Talk about it there with him.

33
00:06:39,484 --> 00:06:40,854
Clinton Hill?

34
00:06:41,517 --> 00:06:44,025
He pays for your cab out there and back each time.

35
00:06:44,055 --> 00:06:46,592
Whether you take it or not.

36
00:06:48,953 --> 00:06:51,898
Please. Just hear what he's gotta say,
That's all I'm asking.

37
00:06:51,899 --> 00:06:54,200
When does your brother want to have this chat?

38
00:06:55,670 --> 00:06:57,119
You know, right now.

39
00:06:57,758 --> 00:06:59,514
That's what I was afraid you were gonna say.

40
00:06:59,515 --> 00:07:00,625
Here you go, Matt.

41
00:07:01,054 --> 00:07:02,417
You know, I'm sorry.

42
00:07:02,777 --> 00:07:03,853
You're eating.

43
00:07:05,260 --> 00:07:06,679
I'll come back.

44
00:07:08,069 --> 00:07:09,179
Yeah.

45
00:07:24,551 --> 00:07:28,604
Jenny, can you keep this warm
for me, please? I'll be back.

46
00:07:37,684 --> 00:07:39,686
It's there on the right.

47
00:07:41,641 --> 00:07:44,383
This is it. Nice place, huh?

48
00:07:47,768 --> 00:07:49,169
Alright, Mr Matt. Go on up.

49
00:07:49,204 --> 00:07:51,724
Kenny don't want me smoking in the house.

50
00:07:54,087 --> 00:07:55,392
Hey, Kenny.

51
00:07:55,874 --> 00:07:58,731
Mr Scudder, come in.

52
00:08:05,545 --> 00:08:07,675
So, you are a private detective.
Is that right?

53
00:08:07,706 --> 00:08:09,980
- Unlicensed.
- What's that mean?

54
00:08:10,916 --> 00:08:12,752
It means, sometimes, I do favors for people.

55
00:08:12,753 --> 00:08:15,627
And sometimes, in return, they give me gifts.

56
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,342
Gifts.

57
00:08:18,307 --> 00:08:20,081
But, you used to be a cop, right?

58
00:08:20,095 --> 00:08:23,764
Yeah. I was with with the 6th Precinct,
then I stopped for a while.

59
00:08:23,797 --> 00:08:26,209
Before that, I was over here with the 75th.

60
00:08:26,828 --> 00:08:28,515
So, why did you quit?

61
00:08:28,553 --> 00:08:30,967
I didn't like the hours, Mr Kristo.

62
00:08:30,968 --> 00:08:33,019
Uh, corruption get to you, huh?

63
00:08:33,307 --> 00:08:34,750
Not really.

64
00:08:34,912 --> 00:08:37,685
It would have been hard to support my family without it.

65
00:08:41,439 --> 00:08:43,133
So, what can I do for you?

66
00:08:45,402 --> 00:08:47,293
Well, this was really my brother's idea, y'know.

67
00:08:47,323 --> 00:08:49,243
Bringing you out here.

68
00:08:50,008 --> 00:08:50,947
If you want, I can leave.

69
00:08:50,948 --> 00:08:52,638
Someone's kidnapped my wife.

70
00:08:54,924 --> 00:08:56,441
That's a federal matter.

71
00:08:56,442 --> 00:08:57,453
They said not to call the cops.

72
00:08:57,454 --> 00:09:00,685
Naturally, they would.
When did this happened?

73
00:09:00,686 --> 00:09:02,024
Yesterday.

74
00:09:02,029 --> 00:09:04,016
You should be talking to the FBI.

75
00:09:04,017 --> 00:09:05,468
- I'm talking to you.
- Look, Mr Kristo...

76
00:09:05,469 --> 00:09:07,739
- Kenny.
- Kenny.

77
00:09:07,773 --> 00:09:10,221
If you're asking me to run a bag, deliver money,...

78
00:09:10,869 --> 00:09:13,613
- ...that's is not something I do.
- I already paid them.

79
00:09:15,048 --> 00:09:15,948
When?

80
00:09:16,422 --> 00:09:17,658
Last night.

81
00:09:17,858 --> 00:09:20,726
- How much?
- Four hundred thousand.

82
00:09:22,561 --> 00:09:24,389
And your wife?
Where is she?

83
00:09:24,431 --> 00:09:26,026
She's dead.

84
00:09:27,718 --> 00:09:29,952
I paid them but they killed her anyway.

85
00:09:36,877 --> 00:09:38,344
I see.

86
00:09:40,611 --> 00:09:42,597
- I'm sorry.
- I don't want you to be sorry.

87
00:09:42,598 --> 00:09:45,709
I want you to find the men who did this,
and bring them to me.

88
00:09:45,710 --> 00:09:48,164
You said you pay them the four hundred the same day?

89
00:09:48,165 --> 00:09:49,096
That's right.

90
00:09:51,972 --> 00:09:55,176
You mind if I ask, what kind of business you're in, Kenny?

91
00:09:56,987 --> 00:09:57,988
Construction.

92
00:09:57,989 --> 00:10:01,319
- What exactly do you construct?
- Houses.

93
00:10:03,363 --> 00:10:06,094
I guess Peter's standing outside right now because

94
00:10:06,124 --> 00:10:08,884
he, what, doesn't like your building methods?

95
00:10:10,193 --> 00:10:12,998
Peter is not supposed to associate with people like me.

96
00:10:12,999 --> 00:10:15,172
People in my profession.

97
00:10:15,173 --> 00:10:17,278
Since when is drug dealing a profession?

98
00:10:18,236 --> 00:10:19,956
I mean, that's the reason, isn't it?

99
00:10:20,597 --> 00:10:22,597
I'm sitting here. Not the cops.
You're a dealer.

100
00:10:22,812 --> 00:10:25,202
Properly speaking, I'm more of a trafficker than a dealer.

101
00:10:25,232 --> 00:10:27,651
You understand the distinction?

102
00:10:28,318 --> 00:10:30,547
I really don't give a shit, one way or the other.

103
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:36,328
Whoever it was that took your wife,
didn't just pick your name out of a hat.

104
00:10:36,806 --> 00:10:40,608
They must have some idea you
have that kind of cash in hand.

105
00:10:40,609 --> 00:10:42,381
That's exactly what I want you to find out.

106
00:10:42,468 --> 00:10:44,281
Who did this?

107
00:10:44,354 --> 00:10:47,789
And there's twenty thousand dollars.
Consider it my gift to you.

108
00:10:47,790 --> 00:10:50,446
There's twenty more if you find
the two fucks who killed her.

109
00:10:52,691 --> 00:10:54,622
So, that you can kill them.

110
00:11:02,929 --> 00:11:06,237
I'm sorry but I can't help you.

111
00:11:16,300 --> 00:11:19,074
It would have been nice if you had
told me what your brother was.

112
00:11:19,109 --> 00:11:20,088
Yeah. You wouldn't have come.

113
00:11:20,098 --> 00:11:22,741
That's right. I wouldn't have.

114
00:11:30,533 --> 00:11:31,896
I stopped drinking that day.

115
00:11:34,267 --> 00:11:35,987
Just, er, it just wasn't as fun after that.

116
00:11:37,299 --> 00:11:41,118
Well, I guess I'm just, er...

117
00:11:42,947 --> 00:11:45,403
Anyway, I'm, er, 8 years sober.

118
00:11:46,840 --> 00:11:49,680
I...well...

119
00:11:51,468 --> 00:11:53,024
That's all. Thanks.

120
00:12:10,775 --> 00:12:11,689
Howie.

121
00:12:13,028 --> 00:12:13,887
Hurt yourself?

122
00:12:13,888 --> 00:12:15,461
I found it out back by the dumpster.

123
00:12:15,821 --> 00:12:20,727
Mrs Dolgren in 202 left it there when
Mr "D" stroked out last week.

124
00:12:22,807 --> 00:12:24,322
Any messages?

125
00:12:31,742 --> 00:12:33,495
I never told you her name.

126
00:12:37,550 --> 00:12:39,933
I don't want you to think that I'm cruel...

127
00:12:41,347 --> 00:12:42,751
or don't care.

128
00:12:47,188 --> 00:12:49,799
I just can't say it.

129
00:12:53,793 --> 00:12:55,762
What happened?

130
00:13:05,057 --> 00:13:06,374
Hello?

131
00:13:10,608 --> 00:13:11,608
Hello?

132
00:13:11,759 --> 00:13:14,501
<i>She never came home, right?</i>

133
00:13:14,662 --> 00:13:16,316
Excuse me?

134
00:13:16,322 --> 00:13:18,356
We've got your wife, fucker.

135
00:13:23,279 --> 00:13:25,096
Carrie?!

136
00:13:30,811 --> 00:13:32,628
Carrie?!

137
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,687
Baby, you up there?!

138
00:13:47,597 --> 00:13:48,928
What is it you want?

139
00:13:48,968 --> 00:13:51,895
We want to help you get your wife back,
if you want her back, that is.

140
00:13:51,905 --> 00:13:55,124
- <i>Of course, I want her back.</i>
- Good. Then, stay by the phone,

141
00:13:55,129 --> 00:13:59,938
don't call the police. I will
be in touch... very soon.

142
00:13:59,969 --> 00:14:02,428
It was, maybe, 10 minutes before they called again.

143
00:14:02,467 --> 00:14:04,797
<i>How much does your wife weigh, Mr Kristo?</i>

144
00:14:05,548 --> 00:14:08,075
<i>110, 120? Something in the
neighbourhood. Something</i>

145
00:14:08,105 --> 00:14:10,662
<i>like... 50 kilograms?
Know what I'm saying?</i>

146
00:14:11,882 --> 00:14:15,832
<i>Now, 50 keys at 20 a key.
You know the score.</i>

147
00:14:17,658 --> 00:14:20,368
<i>Adds up to a million, doesn't it?</i>

148
00:14:20,403 --> 00:14:21,415
What's your point?

149
00:14:21,424 --> 00:14:23,306
My point?

150
00:14:23,467 --> 00:14:28,156
My point is that you pay a million
for her if she were product.

151
00:14:28,158 --> 00:14:32,815
If she was powder, Mr Kristo. Isn't she
worth that much to you in flesh and blood?

152
00:14:32,849 --> 00:14:34,786
I can't pay what I don't have.

153
00:14:34,923 --> 00:14:37,665
<i>How much do you have?</i>

154
00:14:39,614 --> 00:14:41,496
- Four hundred.
- Five.

155
00:14:41,529 --> 00:14:44,390
I'm not haggling. I'll give you the top
figure right away. It's four hundred.

156
00:14:44,465 --> 00:14:46,369
Oh, well...

157
00:14:46,411 --> 00:14:50,263
if that's the best that you can do.
Okay, four hundred it is.

158
00:14:50,305 --> 00:14:53,873
Before I give you anything, I want
to make sure that wife is all right.

159
00:14:53,912 --> 00:14:55,913
<i>Well, that's impossible. I'm at a payphone.</i>

160
00:14:55,985 --> 00:14:57,922
How do I know that you even got her in the first place?

161
00:14:57,964 --> 00:15:00,706
- Are you familiar with her tits?
- Excuse me?

162
00:15:00,709 --> 00:15:03,484
They're quite nice.
Would you recognise one of them?

163
00:15:03,517 --> 00:15:06,379
That would be the easiest way.
I could cut one off.

164
00:15:06,580 --> 00:15:09,830
The one with the cute little mole on it.
I'll leave it on your doorsteps.

165
00:15:09,926 --> 00:15:12,188
- <i>Would that put your mind at rest?</i>
- Jeez, don't say that.

166
00:15:12,198 --> 00:15:15,865
<i>Alright, then. Let's not talk
anymore about proof, okay?</i>

167
00:15:16,856 --> 00:15:19,696
<i>Put the money in 2 plastic bags and go to</i>

168
00:15:19,697 --> 00:15:25,016
<i>the corner of Columbia and Converse,
to the payphone and wait for my call.</i>

169
00:15:34,653 --> 00:15:36,688
- Hello?
- <i>Where's the money?</i>

170
00:15:36,695 --> 00:15:38,956
In the back seat. Two bags like you said.

171
00:15:39,345 --> 00:15:43,392
<i>Good. Now, leave it. Walk up Columbia.
Do it quickly.</i>

172
00:15:44,291 --> 00:15:45,271
And then what?

173
00:15:45,280 --> 00:15:48,101
<i>Wait on the corner for five minutes, then walk back.</i>

174
00:15:48,131 --> 00:15:50,981
<i>Get in your car and go home.</i>

175
00:15:51,855 --> 00:15:53,245
But, what about my wife?

176
00:15:53,896 --> 00:15:55,837
<i>She'll be in the car waiting for you.</i>

177
00:16:03,311 --> 00:16:04,355
Carrie?!

178
00:16:08,098 --> 00:16:09,207
Damn it!

179
00:16:18,693 --> 00:16:20,769
They run me around and finally, they called me

180
00:16:20,799 --> 00:16:22,904
<i>and tells me that she's at home waiting for me.</i>

181
00:16:23,384 --> 00:16:26,343
- <i>I go home and she's not there either.</i>
- Carrie!

182
00:16:32,001 --> 00:16:34,840
- <i>The phone rings again.</i>
- Fuck!

183
00:16:38,638 --> 00:16:41,729
- Where is she?
- <i>He sent me out on a rat hunt.</i>

184
00:16:42,628 --> 00:16:45,554
<i>Tells me she's in the trunk of this abandoned car.</i>

185
00:17:25,486 --> 00:17:27,651
He taped this to the inside of the trunk...

186
00:17:28,582 --> 00:17:32,314
with a note that says "For your listening pleasure".

187
00:17:44,836 --> 00:17:46,773
This is my number.

188
00:17:57,100 --> 00:18:03,000
<i>Shhh. It's OK.
Like emptiness, like emptiness.</i>

189
00:18:03,200 --> 00:18:06,200
<i>My intention ***</i>

190
00:18:07,749 --> 00:18:10,611
<i>Yeah, honey, are you scared, don't you?</i>

191
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:14,200
<i>Yeah, OK for me.</i>

192
00:18:15,200 --> 00:18:19,200
<i>Yeah, come on.
Lets state the table here for work.</i>

193
00:18:20,195 --> 00:18:23,057
<i>Hey, Carrie Anne...</i>

194
00:18:31,621 --> 00:18:32,567
Yes?

195
00:18:34,556 --> 00:18:36,373
Where, in the red hood?

196
00:19:03,533 --> 00:19:07,903
She tipped me 2 dollars which is twice
anybody else tips if they even tip at all.

197
00:19:07,937 --> 00:19:11,195
- You mentioned a van?
- Yeah. It was park tight there.

198
00:19:11,861 --> 00:19:14,637
<i>Two guys got out of it. I remember
they checked her out pretty good.</i>

199
00:19:14,799 --> 00:19:17,508
<i>They were both dressed the same, some kind of uniform.</i>

200
00:19:19,490 --> 00:19:23,276
They pulled out after Mrs Kristo.
<i>Cut her off her driving.</i>

201
00:19:24,372 --> 00:19:26,573
- Remember what the van looked like?
- <i>Yeah.</i>

202
00:19:27,021 --> 00:19:29,447
It was light blue, definitely light blue.

203
00:19:31,010 --> 00:19:33,904
<i>I could tell she's a good cook.
Nothing frozen in the car.</i>

204
00:19:33,946 --> 00:19:37,646
She said she was making kanafeh. Said she's
trying the Lebanese place down the block.

205
00:19:37,680 --> 00:19:41,347
Yeah, the van was parked across the street.
I thought they were making a delivery.

206
00:19:41,350 --> 00:19:42,768
I don't remember a van.

207
00:19:42,769 --> 00:19:45,164
I do remember the pewter maker, Mrs Newess,

208
00:19:45,194 --> 00:19:47,619
came in and saw, like, "Oh, what happened?"

209
00:19:47,620 --> 00:19:49,219
"Are we okay?"

210
00:19:51,977 --> 00:19:54,815
She said two men <i>and the woman run across the</i>

211
00:19:54,845 --> 00:19:57,712
<i>street away from the store and leaped into a van.</i>

212
00:19:57,721 --> 00:19:59,449
<i>She thought they had just robbed the store.</i>

213
00:19:59,636 --> 00:20:00,615
<i>Two men?</i>

214
00:20:02,444 --> 00:20:03,369
Yes.

215
00:20:03,401 --> 00:20:06,001
<i>I think they have the name of a
TV repair place</i> on the side.

216
00:20:06,031 --> 00:20:08,661
Two initials like... "B & R TV".

217
00:20:09,114 --> 00:20:10,566
For sure, "J & M PA."

218
00:20:11,507 --> 00:20:12,284
"R & L Stereo."

219
00:20:12,912 --> 00:20:15,356
"B & A Appliance."

220
00:20:59,542 --> 00:21:01,343
REMAINS OF QUEEN'S WOMAN FOUND IN VACANT LOT.

221
00:21:23,901 --> 00:21:25,636
<i>TJ, I'd like a word with you.</i>

222
00:21:26,059 --> 00:21:27,705
<i>Now, please.</i>

223
00:21:32,342 --> 00:21:35,149
I know you didn't sleep in here.

224
00:21:36,571 --> 00:21:41,913
I know because Mr Keyser said you left
a God-awful mess in the men's room.

225
00:21:44,304 --> 00:21:46,904
<i>Not to mention the mess you left here.</i>

226
00:21:49,139 --> 00:21:53,630
- <i>TJ, you gotta...</i>
- Jill, clean that up later, okay?

227
00:21:53,830 --> 00:21:55,772
Right now, he's helping me with something.

228
00:22:03,400 --> 00:22:06,200
(???) Look at back as she was spoken
the girl on the paper over there.

229
00:22:07,042 --> 00:22:10,610
For what?
No. I'm good.

230
00:22:10,744 --> 00:22:14,037
Sheet's for my head.
Not the first store white dude

231
00:22:14,047 --> 00:22:17,349
coming here try to put a hand on me.

232
00:22:17,446 --> 00:22:19,230
Okay.

233
00:22:30,339 --> 00:22:31,797
Child of God.

234
00:22:33,710 --> 00:22:34,284
What?

235
00:22:35,514 --> 00:22:38,670
The name. Gotteskind.
It means Child of God.

236
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:39,800
It's German.

237
00:22:42,178 --> 00:22:46,512
Except, clearly, God never look out for more reef.

238
00:22:57,528 --> 00:23:01,293
TJ... that short for something?

239
00:23:01,390 --> 00:23:03,327
Yeah, short for TJ.

240
00:23:07,070 --> 00:23:08,953
- You Five-O?
- No.

241
00:23:08,985 --> 00:23:11,434
- But you got that look.
- I work private.

242
00:23:12,751 --> 00:23:15,839
Yeah? Like Sam Spade?

243
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,154
Yeah, just like him.

244
00:23:17,602 --> 00:23:20,593
All I'm saying is, I've read about him.
He immortal, too.

245
00:23:20,602 --> 00:23:22,856
All of those guys.

246
00:23:22,857 --> 00:23:24,777
- You spent that much time in here?
- Some.

247
00:23:25,292 --> 00:23:28,598
Mostly when it rains.
I just like the sound it makes, you know?

248
00:23:30,206 --> 00:23:30,878
Matt.

249
00:23:31,691 --> 00:23:32,982
Short for Matthew.

250
00:23:34,761 --> 00:23:37,203
So, why're you looking at dead pictures, Matthew?

251
00:24:08,678 --> 00:24:12,491
So, these guys you're looking for,
they'll be like real 7:30 or just...

252
00:24:12,492 --> 00:24:14,501
- ...like thugs?
- Like real what?

253
00:24:14,727 --> 00:24:18,712
7:30. It's the time they give
out the meds at the men's ward.

254
00:24:18,747 --> 00:24:20,716
Ah, right. 7:30.

255
00:24:20,789 --> 00:24:23,129
Can that program go back another year?

256
00:24:23,865 --> 00:24:26,937
Listen to you. That program.

257
00:24:26,980 --> 00:24:30,356
It'll take me maybe a minute to figure
out how to work Yahoo all by yourself.

258
00:24:31,383 --> 00:24:34,763
Why bother. From what I hear,
it's all going to shit in 6 months.

259
00:24:34,798 --> 00:24:37,610
Please, please, man. I've got
way more important things

260
00:24:37,640 --> 00:24:40,481
to do than worrying about all that Y2K bullshit.

261
00:24:43,141 --> 00:24:44,985
How ironical.

262
00:24:45,403 --> 00:24:45,955
What's that?

263
00:24:46,376 --> 00:24:49,037
Dumping an already dead body at a cemetery.

264
00:24:49,458 --> 00:24:51,265
<i>"Tuesday, the body of Leila Andresen,"</i>

265
00:24:51,266 --> 00:24:54,325
<i>"a 25-year old interior design
major at Brooklyn College"</i>

266
00:24:54,326 --> 00:24:56,229
<i>"was found at Green-Wood Cemetery."</i>

267
00:24:56,230 --> 00:24:59,368
<i>"Andresen had been missing 2 days when Eduardo Solomon,"</i>

268
00:24:59,750 --> 00:25:01,929
<i>"a florist across the street from the cemetery,"</i>

269
00:25:01,930 --> 00:25:04,316
<i>"found what was later identified as a portion of</i>

270
00:25:04,346 --> 00:25:06,761
<i>the victim's leg in a dumpster behind a shop."</i>

271
00:25:07,152 --> 00:25:09,789
<i>"The same day, more human remains were found</i>

272
00:25:09,819 --> 00:25:12,486
<i>scattered about the cemetery by groundskeepers."</i>

273
00:25:12,896 --> 00:25:17,255
<i>"Witnesses said Andresen was last seen
getting into a blue van with two men."</i>

274
00:25:21,069 --> 00:25:23,467
<i>"Anderson's fiancé, Rueben Quintana, told police that</i>

275
00:25:23,497 --> 00:25:25,925
<i>he and Leila was supposed
to meet over lunch..."</i>

276
00:25:27,383 --> 00:25:28,746
"...but she never showed."

277
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,624
Good guess.
Thanks for your help.

278
00:25:32,491 --> 00:25:34,523
- What's this?
- What's what?

279
00:25:34,916 --> 00:25:38,315
- My time is valuable, man.
- How valuable?

280
00:25:42,067 --> 00:25:43,618
10 bucks.

281
00:25:45,894 --> 00:25:47,860
Here's 20. Take it easy.

282
00:25:52,577 --> 00:25:54,585
I'm gonna go get something to eat.

283
00:25:58,851 --> 00:26:00,853
You want a hamburger or something?

284
00:26:01,787 --> 00:26:03,149
I don't eat meat.

285
00:26:03,605 --> 00:26:07,870
<i>Oh, okay. Nice meeting you, TJ.</i>

286
00:26:10,274 --> 00:26:12,792
What I'm saying is, I don't care nothing about cows.

287
00:26:13,652 --> 00:26:15,690
Just care about what I put inside my body.

288
00:26:15,785 --> 00:26:19,439
No meat, no soda, no pringles, none of that shit.

289
00:26:19,869 --> 00:26:22,289
I was thinking about getting a little eat-on myself.

290
00:26:22,689 --> 00:26:27,474
Alright. Shall we then both get
our eat-ons together? Come on.

291
00:26:31,592 --> 00:26:32,802
<i>Come on, Watson.</i>

292
00:27:11,746 --> 00:27:15,865
Where do you sleep?
It's nice again hiding in the library.

293
00:27:16,399 --> 00:27:18,733
It's a nice place to stay.

294
00:27:19,655 --> 00:27:20,855
What happened to your parents?

295
00:27:21,951 --> 00:27:23,538
You don't have to feel sorry for me.

296
00:27:23,930 --> 00:27:26,397
- I don't.
- Good.

297
00:27:29,268 --> 00:27:32,133
You could hire me, though.
Make me a partner.

298
00:27:32,134 --> 00:27:33,087
I don't think so.

299
00:27:33,998 --> 00:27:36,511
Why? You think I don't have what
it takes to be a good detective?

300
00:27:36,512 --> 00:27:39,843
I'm sure you do.
I'm just not the partner type.

301
00:27:41,619 --> 00:27:45,565
- What does it takes to be a good detective anyway?
- A strong bladder.

302
00:27:46,173 --> 00:27:47,355
Seriously.

303
00:27:48,337 --> 00:27:49,995
I don't know what it takes.

304
00:27:50,894 --> 00:27:53,475
I don't know?
Patience. Instincts.

305
00:27:54,088 --> 00:27:55,990
Blind luck, mostly.

306
00:27:56,564 --> 00:27:58,918
And a good name. A good
name is very important.

307
00:27:59,061 --> 00:28:03,690
One with varied flavour like...
Sam Spade or Philip Marlowe.

308
00:28:03,693 --> 00:28:05,606
What's wrong with the name you got?

309
00:28:05,607 --> 00:28:06,208
No, man.

310
00:28:06,247 --> 00:28:11,346
You think something more like Daunte Culpepper?

311
00:28:11,608 --> 00:28:13,390
Quarterback from Minnesota.

312
00:28:15,261 --> 00:28:19,447
It's a good name for a detective but a lame
ass name for a guy who plays football.

313
00:28:20,383 --> 00:28:21,792
Daunte Culpepper.

314
00:28:22,795 --> 00:28:26,690
Ya, Daunte Culpepper, private eye.

315
00:28:27,244 --> 00:28:28,511
Now, I like that name a lot.

316
00:28:29,217 --> 00:28:31,808
You sure you don't want a soda or something, honey?

317
00:28:32,345 --> 00:28:35,428
I know you just love to give a
young black male like myself

318
00:28:35,458 --> 00:28:38,570
one of your sperm killer sodas, but no, thank you, ma'am.

319
00:28:38,571 --> 00:28:40,135
I'll stick with the water.

320
00:28:43,935 --> 00:28:46,223
What? You only give sodas
to some low income people,

321
00:28:46,265 --> 00:28:49,284
With a bunch of chemicals and with stabilizers.

322
00:28:49,285 --> 00:28:53,116
That's why I only drink water;
A gallon a day and stay hydrated.

323
00:28:53,125 --> 00:28:54,337
You don't eat meat?

324
00:28:54,530 --> 00:28:56,957
Yeah, so what?
You got a problem with that?

325
00:28:57,058 --> 00:28:59,699
Not at all. My ex-wife, she was vegetarian.

326
00:28:59,700 --> 00:29:01,680
So, what happened?
Why did you split?

327
00:29:01,710 --> 00:29:03,943
- What was she? A clucker?
- A what?

328
00:29:03,944 --> 00:29:05,744
A clucker. A chicken head.

329
00:29:05,745 --> 00:29:08,698
You know, those females that only like
you if you give them nice things.

330
00:29:08,757 --> 00:29:11,051
If you ain't "bling bling", you ain't seen shit.

331
00:29:11,635 --> 00:29:12,595
Can't you speak English?

332
00:29:12,936 --> 00:29:15,111
I don't know. Sorry.

333
00:29:16,081 --> 00:29:19,157
- Wait a minute. What time is it?
- Almost 10.

334
00:29:19,158 --> 00:29:22,826
Shit. I gotta go back to the shelter.
They close at 10.

335
00:29:23,427 --> 00:29:25,026
Thanks for the pancakes.

336
00:30:43,986 --> 00:30:45,191
Jonas Loogan?

337
00:30:45,765 --> 00:30:46,759
Yes.

338
00:30:47,237 --> 00:30:48,672
You're the gardener here.

339
00:30:49,399 --> 00:30:51,469
I'm the groundskeeper here.
Can I help you?

340
00:30:51,508 --> 00:30:54,352
- I'm Matthew Scudder.
- Whoa, that was fast.

341
00:30:54,518 --> 00:30:56,809
Public Affairs back at the 77th said that it would

342
00:30:56,839 --> 00:30:59,160
be at least a week before anyone get back to me.

343
00:30:59,161 --> 00:31:00,187
Excuse me?

344
00:31:00,198 --> 00:31:01,981
You really want the book to have
the authentic feel, you know?

345
00:31:01,985 --> 00:31:02,917
Book?

346
00:31:02,918 --> 00:31:04,802
That's why this ride along is
so important to me, you know.

347
00:31:04,803 --> 00:31:07,442
Spent some real time with real cops?

348
00:31:11,594 --> 00:31:14,460
- What do you want?
- I was hoping I can talk to you about Leila Andresen.

349
00:31:15,421 --> 00:31:16,367
Who?

350
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:18,287
The woman they found over here.

351
00:31:19,250 --> 00:31:21,157
Yeah, I don't know anything about that.

352
00:31:21,707 --> 00:31:23,387
Your boss tells me you were here that day.

353
00:31:24,120 --> 00:31:26,109
- You spoke to Larry?
- Yeah.

354
00:31:26,431 --> 00:31:28,805
Great. Cause my boss is Gretchen, okay?

355
00:31:29,701 --> 00:31:31,630
Oh boy. I messed up.

356
00:31:32,589 --> 00:31:34,568
You are too smart for me, Jonas. Damn.

357
00:31:35,290 --> 00:31:36,866
Think you can help me anyway?

358
00:31:36,899 --> 00:31:39,955
I already told everything I know to the police.

359
00:31:40,375 --> 00:31:42,369
Eduardo, the guy who owns the shop across the street,

360
00:31:42,370 --> 00:31:45,408
says there were about 20 garbage
bags over here. That true?

361
00:31:45,689 --> 00:31:46,571
Eduardo was wrong. There
were only about 10,

362
00:31:46,572 --> 00:31:49,658
and most of those were on the 5th Avenue side.

363
00:31:49,659 --> 00:31:51,831
And there were 4 more floating in the pond down there.

364
00:31:52,280 --> 00:31:54,162
So, you saw them?

365
00:31:54,673 --> 00:31:56,044
I saw the pigeon first.

366
00:31:57,003 --> 00:31:58,459
I keep a coop on my roof.

367
00:31:59,364 --> 00:32:01,262
This was a helmet.

368
00:32:01,406 --> 00:32:03,226
Leave it alone, which if you know anything at

369
00:32:03,256 --> 00:32:05,105
all, but helmet's quite unusual for that breed.

370
00:32:05,204 --> 00:32:08,962
It was sitting on one of the bags trying
to get at whatever was in there.

371
00:32:09,639 --> 00:32:11,811
I just fish them both out after they've
done with the mowing and threw it away.

372
00:32:11,812 --> 00:32:13,715
You didn't open them?

373
00:32:14,303 --> 00:32:16,870
Nah. I figure it was all
just some water-logged

374
00:32:16,900 --> 00:32:19,496
trash the kids have thrown into the night before.

375
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:21,511
They do that, you know.

376
00:32:22,022 --> 00:32:24,255
Throw their rubbers and their empties into the pond.

377
00:32:26,123 --> 00:32:27,691
You see the corpse across the street?

378
00:32:27,692 --> 00:32:29,817
Yeah, I didn't make that connection till Vince

379
00:32:29,847 --> 00:32:32,001
came running over from the 5th Avenue entrance.

380
00:32:32,011 --> 00:32:32,810
Vince?

381
00:32:33,097 --> 00:32:34,811
Yeah. The other groundskeeper.

382
00:32:35,171 --> 00:32:37,119
He's the one that found the bags over there.

383
00:32:37,149 --> 00:32:39,127
Is Vince around?
I'd like to talk to him.

384
00:32:39,159 --> 00:32:42,372
He quit. He opened one of the bags.

385
00:32:46,180 --> 00:32:48,246
You know, I was just starting to forget about her.

386
00:32:48,829 --> 00:32:51,074
Thank you so much for bringing that all back.

387
00:32:51,714 --> 00:32:52,958
What's your book about?

388
00:32:53,786 --> 00:32:55,765
Don't patronize me.

389
00:34:23,575 --> 00:34:25,457
- Yo, Matt, what cha doing?
- Hello, TJ.

390
00:34:25,969 --> 00:34:27,689
- You know I've been shadowing ya.
- No kidding?

391
00:34:27,921 --> 00:34:32,759
Er, so, I followed subject back from
dinner till meeting night in church.

392
00:34:32,766 --> 00:34:34,099
Used to drink some, huh?

393
00:34:35,942 --> 00:34:38,813
I then followed subject back to some
shitty-ass building on 45th...

394
00:34:38,814 --> 00:34:41,844
- ...where subject remained...
- I know where I was, TJ.

395
00:34:43,619 --> 00:34:46,677
- You met me at that flower shop, didn't you?
- I met you back at the subway.

396
00:34:47,059 --> 00:34:48,394
Damn!

397
00:34:48,395 --> 00:34:50,280
This book I'm reading says that a foot tail's hard

398
00:34:50,310 --> 00:34:52,224
if you're doing it on account it's so easy to spot.

399
00:34:52,225 --> 00:34:53,276
That it is.

400
00:34:53,277 --> 00:34:55,315
They said it's good to use 3 guys.
Two alternating

401
00:34:55,345 --> 00:34:57,413
behind and another guy on the other side of the street.

402
00:34:57,414 --> 00:34:58,962
Sure, if you have 3 guys.

403
00:34:59,542 --> 00:35:03,387
You know, you used to spend a lot of time
in church and you used a lot of payphones.

404
00:35:03,388 --> 00:35:04,256
So?

405
00:35:04,329 --> 00:35:06,416
- So, you don't got no cellphone?
- I don't like them.

406
00:35:06,635 --> 00:35:09,290
You don't like computers and you don't like cellphones.

407
00:35:09,291 --> 00:35:12,433
Fucking Amish got more flavour than you do, Matthew.

408
00:35:12,469 --> 00:35:15,269
I watched you follow some dude.
You didn't even try to hide or nothing.

409
00:35:15,274 --> 00:35:16,274
He wasn't looking for me.

410
00:35:16,775 --> 00:35:19,175
It's funny. Me following you
while you follow some other guy.

411
00:35:19,647 --> 00:35:21,917
It's real ironical.

412
00:35:31,486 --> 00:35:32,276
- TJ.
- Yeah?

413
00:35:32,284 --> 00:35:33,397
Stop following me.

414
00:35:41,953 --> 00:35:44,022
- Reuben Quintana?
- Can I help you with something?

415
00:35:44,108 --> 00:35:48,176
My name's Matt Scudder. I was wondering if
I could talk to you about your fiancée.

416
00:35:48,177 --> 00:35:49,952
- Fiancée?
- Leila Andresen.

417
00:35:49,953 --> 00:35:50,759
Oh, Leila, ah...

418
00:35:52,134 --> 00:35:55,408
- You know, I gotta have this little place I have to be...
- It'll just be a minute.

419
00:35:55,950 --> 00:35:56,450
Yeah, okay.

420
00:35:59,155 --> 00:35:59,974
Yeah, come on in.

421
00:36:01,519 --> 00:36:04,035
- Can I get you something to drink?
- No. Thank you.

422
00:36:05,914 --> 00:36:08,783
Must be nice to have the time to
work out in the middle of the day.

423
00:36:09,461 --> 00:36:11,249
I'd rather be working. Period.

424
00:36:12,516 --> 00:36:15,503
- I'm an actor.
- Yeah, I thought you were familiar.

425
00:36:15,691 --> 00:36:17,438
Have I've seen something you've been in?

426
00:36:17,439 --> 00:36:20,264
Maybe. I did a Stetson
commercial few years back.

427
00:36:20,265 --> 00:36:23,147
- Stetson the hat?
- No, cologne.

428
00:36:23,434 --> 00:36:26,398
- Ran during the Stanley Cup final.
- Most admirable.

429
00:36:28,823 --> 00:36:30,786
Leila went to Brooklyn College, is that right?

430
00:36:30,787 --> 00:36:33,671
- Study decorating?
- Interior design.

431
00:36:33,672 --> 00:36:34,511
Right.

432
00:36:35,727 --> 00:36:37,828
You told the police that it was 3 men who took her.

433
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,350
- Yeah, that's right.
- You sure about that?

434
00:36:40,351 --> 00:36:42,426
Yeah, I saw them.

435
00:36:43,194 --> 00:36:45,066
<i>I was at the coffee place on Prospect.</i>

436
00:36:45,952 --> 00:36:47,592
<i>She used to meet me there sometimes.</i>

437
00:36:48,085 --> 00:36:50,370
<i>When I see 2 guys jumped out of the van and grabbed her.</i>

438
00:36:53,630 --> 00:36:56,049
- What they look like?
- I couldn't really see the faces

439
00:36:56,050 --> 00:36:58,019
but I could see a third guy behind the wheel.

440
00:37:00,125 --> 00:37:00,787
Hey?!

441
00:37:01,816 --> 00:37:04,241
Hey! What are you doing?!

442
00:37:04,657 --> 00:37:05,817
It's the last time I saw her.

443
00:37:06,246 --> 00:37:09,560
This is a nice place. Lots of nice stuff.

444
00:37:09,561 --> 00:37:13,327
- Leila do the design?
- Yeah, you should see the bedrooms.

445
00:37:14,818 --> 00:37:17,191
Wait, that doesn't sound right.

446
00:37:17,230 --> 00:37:19,134
You don't deal, do you, Reuben?

447
00:37:19,135 --> 00:37:20,919
- What?
- You heard me.

448
00:37:20,920 --> 00:37:23,798
- You're asking if I'm a drug dealer?
- Unless you prefer trafficker?

449
00:37:24,220 --> 00:37:27,819
Or maybe you wanna tell me you made your
money peddling cologne on ESPN?

450
00:37:28,048 --> 00:37:29,515
I got a trust fund.

451
00:37:29,611 --> 00:37:31,437
- From your rich family up in the Bronx?
- Yeah.

452
00:37:31,438 --> 00:37:34,307
- My mom won a lawsuit a few years back.
- Come on, Reuben.

453
00:37:34,308 --> 00:37:37,183
Nor even a dog's dumb enough to buy that one.

454
00:37:38,034 --> 00:37:40,826
Look, I don't care how you earn your living but

455
00:37:40,856 --> 00:37:43,677
the guys that grabbed Leila, they might have.

456
00:37:43,680 --> 00:37:44,833
How do you mean?

457
00:37:48,649 --> 00:37:49,609
How do you mean?

458
00:37:50,145 --> 00:37:51,484
Thanks for your time.

459
00:37:53,436 --> 00:37:54,942
Thank you.

460
00:38:14,800 --> 00:38:17,448
Jonas, what are you doing outside?

461
00:38:49,075 --> 00:38:53,704
What's happening?
Why did the police come looking for me?

462
00:39:42,435 --> 00:39:45,210
"He carried her through the field"

463
00:39:45,499 --> 00:39:49,485
"the dandelions and cattails still wet with morning dew,"

464
00:39:49,648 --> 00:39:51,874
"and set her down by a steam,"

465
00:39:51,978 --> 00:39:54,748
"whispering through the strands
of her fine yellow hair."

466
00:39:55,711 --> 00:39:58,615
"You're safe now. You're safe."

467
00:40:00,482 --> 00:40:01,551
Fuck!

468
00:40:31,782 --> 00:40:32,996
Jonas.

469
00:40:36,717 --> 00:40:38,251
You caught me.

470
00:40:39,571 --> 00:40:42,317
You gave the cops a different address, didn't you?

471
00:40:42,662 --> 00:40:45,859
That's why they never put you
across the street from Leila.

472
00:40:46,822 --> 00:40:48,696
This is my mother's building.

473
00:40:49,088 --> 00:40:52,527
I live in Sunset Park, but I am not
allowed to keep my birds there.

474
00:40:52,630 --> 00:40:54,514
Even though there's room on the roof.

475
00:40:56,333 --> 00:41:00,201
Your mom home right now? Maybe we can
go down and talk, have a cup of coffee.

476
00:41:01,598 --> 00:41:03,045
I can't let you leave here.

477
00:41:03,723 --> 00:41:05,168
They'll kill me if I do.

478
00:41:05,319 --> 00:41:06,804
Who's they, Jonas?

479
00:41:07,186 --> 00:41:07,829
The other two.

480
00:41:07,830 --> 00:41:11,964
So what? You're gonna stab me now
with the big fucking knife?

481
00:41:13,501 --> 00:41:16,130
It's going to bother me, too, for a long time.
I know it will.

482
00:41:16,131 --> 00:41:20,260
How much is it gonna bother you if I take
that knife away and stick it in your neck?

483
00:41:20,267 --> 00:41:23,203
- Could you really do that?
- Yeah, I will. I could.

484
00:41:23,204 --> 00:41:24,585
But I rather not.

485
00:41:25,165 --> 00:41:26,960
How about let's say we trade?

486
00:41:28,884 --> 00:41:30,759
- Okay.
- Set it down.

487
00:41:40,372 --> 00:41:44,796
- What was it I said gave me away?
- Everything. You're a weirdo, Jonas.

488
00:41:44,797 --> 00:41:47,045
I never laid a hand on Leila.

489
00:41:48,098 --> 00:41:50,550
The other two.
They're the ones you've better worry about.

490
00:41:50,551 --> 00:41:51,775
What other two?

491
00:41:55,651 --> 00:41:56,609
Jonas.

492
00:41:59,041 --> 00:42:00,385
What other two?

493
00:42:07,141 --> 00:42:09,037
They're not human.

494
00:42:10,913 --> 00:42:11,955
How 'd you meet them?

495
00:42:17,773 --> 00:42:19,557
<i>It's this video store near my house.</i>

496
00:42:20,518 --> 00:42:24,373
<i>They've got this basement where they keep
some of them more specialised stuff.</i>

497
00:42:26,231 --> 00:42:28,170
<i>I was killing the game.</i>

498
00:42:29,128 --> 00:42:32,003
<i>You wouldn't really noticed them unless they spoke to you.</i>

499
00:42:32,495 --> 00:42:35,784
<i>One of them had a beard or a goatee.</i>

500
00:42:36,234 --> 00:42:39,644
<i>The other one smile a lot.
He did all the talking.</i>

501
00:42:39,762 --> 00:42:40,822
What about names?

502
00:42:41,042 --> 00:42:44,430
You don't exchange names in a place like that.

503
00:42:44,718 --> 00:42:46,303
Not real ones, anyway.

504
00:42:46,304 --> 00:42:49,214
They love that I worked in the cemetery.
Thought it was funny.

505
00:42:49,878 --> 00:42:52,075
<i>Want to buy me drinks.</i>

506
00:42:52,335 --> 00:42:56,836
<i>So, we went to this bar in the
middle of the day. Had rum and coke.</i>

507
00:42:56,995 --> 00:42:58,738
<i>Talked about the different videos we liked.</i>

508
00:42:58,814 --> 00:43:01,159
<i>I saw the awful way they laughed, like</i>

509
00:43:01,189 --> 00:43:03,564
<i>watching over drug addicts fucked each other.</i>

510
00:43:03,565 --> 00:43:05,610
<i>They were like obsessed with that whole world.</i>

511
00:43:05,783 --> 00:43:09,257
Dealers, addicts, different kinds of drugs.

512
00:43:10,251 --> 00:43:11,691
They told me they work with the DEA.

513
00:43:12,088 --> 00:43:13,135
They were cops?

514
00:43:13,136 --> 00:43:14,409
I wouldn't say for sure...

515
00:43:15,924 --> 00:43:17,324
except what they did was secret.

516
00:43:18,861 --> 00:43:21,726
<i>But they have one of those police radios, you know.</i>

517
00:43:21,856 --> 00:43:24,469
<i>One of those hand held unit and they had all these</i>

518
00:43:24,499 --> 00:43:27,141
<i>files on drug dealers with DEA stamps on them.</i>

519
00:43:27,142 --> 00:43:29,063
Told me they work on special assignments.

520
00:43:29,264 --> 00:43:31,172
You told them about Reuben?

521
00:43:31,363 --> 00:43:33,130
I...I told them about Leila.

522
00:43:33,789 --> 00:43:36,091
About how I wanted to save her from Reuben.

523
00:43:36,310 --> 00:43:38,392
<i>So, we came up here and we watched them for a while.</i>

524
00:43:40,013 --> 00:43:41,857
<i>They said they wanted to help her too.</i>

525
00:43:42,758 --> 00:43:44,736
<i>So, you followed her?</i>

526
00:43:45,214 --> 00:43:46,565
<i>Picked her up off the street.</i>

527
00:43:48,214 --> 00:43:49,138
<i>Then what?</i>

528
00:43:49,139 --> 00:43:50,424
I drove around with her.

529
00:43:50,576 --> 00:43:53,878
<i>We finally parked somewhere near the water in Brooklyn.</i>

530
00:43:53,879 --> 00:43:55,688
<i>Said they wanted to make their own video.</i>

531
00:43:56,480 --> 00:43:58,071
<i>She was really scared.</i>

532
00:43:58,072 --> 00:43:59,289
<i>They love that.</i>

533
00:44:09,047 --> 00:44:10,660
<i>They kept talking to her.</i>

534
00:44:11,268 --> 00:44:12,595
Pick one. Which one is your favourite?

535
00:44:12,596 --> 00:44:14,603
Eenie, mini, minee, mo.

536
00:44:14,604 --> 00:44:17,482
You pick one you wanna keep and I'll pick the other.

537
00:44:17,769 --> 00:44:22,118
One for you, one for me.
That's fair, isn't it?

538
00:44:22,119 --> 00:44:25,039
You're gonna pick one or I'm gonna take them both.

539
00:44:25,040 --> 00:44:27,926
Well, what are you waiting for?
You trying to stall?

540
00:44:28,405 --> 00:44:29,740
You trying to make me mad?

541
00:44:29,809 --> 00:44:31,720
Touch the one that you wanna keep.

542
00:44:32,202 --> 00:44:33,578
This one?

543
00:44:33,579 --> 00:44:34,522
Okay, good.

544
00:44:34,713 --> 00:44:36,435
It is an excellent choice.

545
00:44:36,638 --> 00:44:40,337
That means that one's yours...
and this one is mine.

546
00:44:40,338 --> 00:44:42,757
Practice is practice.
You never change.

547
00:44:48,907 --> 00:44:51,854
Then, 2 days later, I think they thought it to be funny...

548
00:44:51,855 --> 00:44:54,693
showed up for work and there's cops dispatched everywhere.

549
00:44:55,630 --> 00:44:57,563
You know, I never say anything.

550
00:44:57,573 --> 00:44:59,460
Where was this video place you met these two?

551
00:44:59,461 --> 00:45:00,700
He moves around a lot.

552
00:45:01,083 --> 00:45:04,042
- I'll still be there, who knows?
- How do I get in?

553
00:45:04,043 --> 00:45:04,996
Helps if they know you.

554
00:45:04,997 --> 00:45:06,446
What if you come with me?

555
00:45:11,215 --> 00:45:12,987
Can I feed my birds first?

556
00:45:30,573 --> 00:45:31,403
Ray.

557
00:45:32,264 --> 00:45:33,029
What was that?

558
00:45:35,495 --> 00:45:36,757
That was his name.

559
00:45:36,758 --> 00:45:39,180
Which one? The quiet one?
Or the...

560
00:45:45,475 --> 00:45:46,807
Jesus.

561
00:45:53,013 --> 00:45:55,904
I was off duty one day in this bar in Washington Heights.

562
00:45:56,784 --> 00:45:58,844
The cops didn't have to pay for their drinks.

563
00:46:00,142 --> 00:46:02,002
And a couple of guys came in to rob the place.

564
00:46:03,531 --> 00:46:06,401
I chased them into the street.
Shot two dead.

565
00:46:07,290 --> 00:46:08,697
Got the third one in the leg.

566
00:46:09,587 --> 00:46:11,183
He never walk right again.

567
00:46:13,099 --> 00:46:15,297
Yeah. I quit drinking that day.

568
00:46:17,227 --> 00:46:21,717
It's just... wasn't as much fun after that.

569
00:47:22,725 --> 00:47:24,833
People are afraid of all the wrong things.

570
00:47:54,060 --> 00:47:55,417
I'll be right back.

571
00:48:50,051 --> 00:48:52,025
I wonder if he pays much for the nurse.

572
00:48:53,498 --> 00:48:56,687
No mistake. Come on. Let's go.

573
00:49:03,013 --> 00:49:04,823
Wait, wait.

574
00:49:52,728 --> 00:49:54,627
They worked for the fucking DEA?

575
00:49:54,628 --> 00:49:57,467
Probably not for very long and
almost certainly not its agents.

576
00:49:57,799 --> 00:49:58,967
And what were they?

577
00:49:59,097 --> 00:50:01,278
I don't know. Maybe they were
used as confidential informants.

578
00:50:01,279 --> 00:50:03,247
Maybe they were office staff.

579
00:50:03,260 --> 00:50:06,222
Whatever they were, they couldn't have
gone very far or lasted very long.

580
00:50:06,223 --> 00:50:08,105
- Why not?
- Because they're insane.

581
00:50:09,068 --> 00:50:12,766
If only you managed to get your hands on
some files, one of which had my name on it.

582
00:50:12,767 --> 00:50:15,379
And if my name's on the DEA file,
that means I'm being locked down, right?

583
00:50:15,610 --> 00:50:17,015
Well, you were at one time.

584
00:50:18,226 --> 00:50:20,511
You know a lot of people who do what you do?

585
00:50:21,372 --> 00:50:25,166
It's not like we have a union or anything
but I know a few. Why?

586
00:50:25,167 --> 00:50:27,606
I want you to call them and tell them
what happened to Carrie.

587
00:50:27,607 --> 00:50:30,064
- Tell them you've hired me...
- Are you fucking kidding me?!

588
00:50:30,065 --> 00:50:32,362
Word gets out about Carrie, the cops will--

589
00:50:32,363 --> 00:50:33,698
They've done this before...

590
00:50:34,150 --> 00:50:35,185
and they're gonna do it again.

591
00:50:35,236 --> 00:50:37,045
And this time, I wanna hear about it.

592
00:50:37,428 --> 00:50:38,682
What do I say?

593
00:50:40,225 --> 00:50:41,544
I'll think of something.

594
00:50:43,307 --> 00:50:44,414
I could have paid him.

595
00:50:46,511 --> 00:50:48,808
I had the whole million.

596
00:50:49,834 --> 00:50:53,051
It was our nest egg. You know, the
money I was going to use to get out.

597
00:50:53,437 --> 00:50:55,555
This guy I know, he's gonna put me in some internet

598
00:50:55,585 --> 00:50:57,733
start-up, sells shoes online or some bullshit.

599
00:50:57,734 --> 00:50:59,830
It was our future, and I didn't want to give it to them.

600
00:50:59,860 --> 00:51:01,986
Now, how fucking stupid is that?

601
00:51:01,987 --> 00:51:03,990
She was already dead.

602
00:51:04,415 --> 00:51:06,535
And if she wasn't, they would have killed her anyway.

603
00:51:07,415 --> 00:51:09,323
Call your friends.

604
00:51:45,767 --> 00:51:47,968
REMAINS OF QUEENS WOMAN FOUND IN VACANT LOT

605
00:51:54,939 --> 00:51:57,195
I just knew her as Marie.

606
00:51:57,652 --> 00:51:59,113
Jacinto, my man.

607
00:51:59,248 --> 00:52:02,401
- [Speaks Spanish] You have any cold drinks?
- You know where it is.

608
00:52:04,842 --> 00:52:06,162
She lives around here?

609
00:52:06,970 --> 00:52:08,781
- She works around here.
- Where?

610
00:52:09,204 --> 00:52:10,581
On the corner.

611
00:52:11,151 --> 00:52:14,372
No, no. Your mama like the 1%, not the 2.

612
00:52:16,319 --> 00:52:17,371
She was a dealer?

613
00:52:19,317 --> 00:52:22,973
She works out of the crib not too far
from here, if you know what I mean.

614
00:52:25,830 --> 00:52:27,517
[Speaks Spanish]

615
00:52:31,622 --> 00:52:34,663
See that old building down the block
with the vacant patch on the ground?

616
00:53:49,531 --> 00:53:52,918
Alright, tell me, cocksucker.
What do you want with Marie G?

617
00:53:56,035 --> 00:53:57,663
You're on the job, fucker?

618
00:53:58,360 --> 00:53:58,853
Retired.

619
00:53:58,854 --> 00:54:00,738
Who you working for? The family?

620
00:54:00,962 --> 00:54:03,511
Shit. When are you guys
gonna leave it alone, huh?

621
00:54:03,512 --> 00:54:04,947
We didn't do it, okay?

622
00:54:05,043 --> 00:54:05,686
Okay.

623
00:54:05,687 --> 00:54:09,091
You think we just chopped up a cop and
leave her on our own fucking doorsteps?

624
00:54:09,092 --> 00:54:12,064
My son's a fucking moron but he's not an idiot.

625
00:54:12,942 --> 00:54:15,001
Wait. Marie was a cop?

626
00:54:15,986 --> 00:54:16,828
Who are you?

627
00:54:17,714 --> 00:54:20,715
I'm not after you or your son.

628
00:54:22,274 --> 00:54:23,812
I want...

629
00:54:25,599 --> 00:54:27,407
I want the guys that killed Marie.

630
00:54:28,257 --> 00:54:29,930
Not if I kill them first.

631
00:54:31,736 --> 00:54:34,548
- You dealing out of the store?
- Not anymore.

632
00:54:35,747 --> 00:54:36,931
But she was working you?

633
00:54:37,407 --> 00:54:41,800
Working you?
The fucking moron wanted to marry her.

634
00:54:42,226 --> 00:54:43,623
That's how good she was.

635
00:54:52,859 --> 00:54:54,636
Hello, my name is Peter.

636
00:54:54,704 --> 00:54:57,661
I'm an alcoholic, and still drug addict.

637
00:54:57,882 --> 00:55:00,917
- And I got one date back...
- Hi, Peter.

638
00:55:01,437 --> 00:55:06,303
To see all friendly faces again.
Still have managed to turn your backs on me.

639
00:55:07,626 --> 00:55:10,277
- So, I slipped, you know.
- It happens.

640
00:55:10,388 --> 00:55:12,965
The funny thing is, I ain't start using it until I was 28.

641
00:55:13,212 --> 00:55:15,560
Up until then, I haven't smoke a joint even when I was

642
00:55:15,590 --> 00:55:17,967
overseas and half my unit were on one thing or another.

643
00:55:17,968 --> 00:55:19,384
You were in the army?

644
00:55:19,385 --> 00:55:21,973
Yeah, in Germany and Desert Storm.

645
00:55:22,495 --> 00:55:25,817
I come home. Go back to school, and
me and Kenny start dealing.

646
00:55:26,233 --> 00:55:28,267
<i>It's enough to get by...</i>

647
00:55:30,193 --> 00:55:33,000
I was dealing in College, I do it to pay for art school.

648
00:55:33,065 --> 00:55:35,263
I wanna get hooked on the product, dropped out.

649
00:55:35,264 --> 00:55:39,149
Meanwhile, Kenny, he stays in the business
aspects and gets some real money.

650
00:55:39,150 --> 00:55:41,963
While I'm in garbage and sleeping in abandoned buildings.

651
00:55:41,964 --> 00:55:45,339
Till one night, I nearly blew my fucking
heart out of my mouth up in Harlem.

652
00:55:45,340 --> 00:55:46,783
What you gonna do now?

653
00:55:47,202 --> 00:55:50,295
I got this job as a bread maker.
I figure, stay busy at

654
00:55:50,325 --> 00:55:53,448
night, sleep during the day.
Get into less trouble.

655
00:55:55,370 --> 00:55:58,136
- Alright. See you around.
- Take it easy.

656
00:55:58,137 --> 00:56:00,244
<i>The number you have reached is not in service.</i>

657
00:56:00,245 --> 00:56:01,591
<i>Please try...</i>

658
00:56:03,022 --> 00:56:04,079
<i>Directory assistance.</i>

659
00:56:04,080 --> 00:56:07,786
Hello. I'd like the number for the
East Village Plumbing, please.

660
00:56:07,787 --> 00:56:08,326
<i>Which zone?</i>

661
00:56:08,327 --> 00:56:11,528
- I assume it's the East Village.
- <i>One moment.</i>

662
00:56:11,804 --> 00:56:14,548
- <i>No listing in Manhattan.</i>
- Try Brooklyn.

663
00:56:14,682 --> 00:56:17,999
- <i>Nothing in Brooklyn.</i>
- Try all the boroughs.

664
00:56:18,582 --> 00:56:21,139
- <i>I'm sorry. We have no listing.</i>
- Thanks.

665
00:56:42,816 --> 00:56:43,946
What happened to you?

666
00:56:44,168 --> 00:56:46,180
I bumped into something.
You okay?

667
00:56:47,099 --> 00:56:48,161
I'm fine.

668
00:56:48,678 --> 00:56:50,970
- What you got there in your bag, man?
- Nothing.

669
00:56:50,971 --> 00:56:55,410
It's my notebook, some twislers and my pencil case.

670
00:56:55,411 --> 00:56:57,939
No. I'm talking about the
black Beretta with the taped

671
00:56:57,969 --> 00:57:00,527
grip you've got tucked beside your water bottle.

672
00:57:00,528 --> 00:57:01,433
Oh.

673
00:57:02,101 --> 00:57:03,330
You mean this.

674
00:57:03,760 --> 00:57:04,913
My new gem.

675
00:57:07,221 --> 00:57:10,095
It's a nice one.
What are you planning on doing with it?

676
00:57:10,096 --> 00:57:12,216
I don't know, man.
Right now, I use it for protection.

677
00:57:12,596 --> 00:57:15,838
I figure, being a detective, you need a piece.

678
00:57:16,316 --> 00:57:17,724
Uh huh. Where did you get it?

679
00:57:18,175 --> 00:57:20,302
I was taking a nap in some alley.

680
00:57:20,720 --> 00:57:21,500
Heard some footsteps.

681
00:57:21,501 --> 00:57:24,450
I seen some dude who works as a lookout for some bulls

682
00:57:24,451 --> 00:57:27,325
and he just threw the bag in the dumpster and split.

683
00:57:27,931 --> 00:57:29,261
You stole someone's stash?

684
00:57:30,409 --> 00:57:33,069
I didn't steal it. I left the money
in the rock where it was.

685
00:57:34,664 --> 00:57:36,874
They'll gonna come back for the piece, you know that?

686
00:57:36,875 --> 00:57:39,861
Nah. There ain't no way, man.
You can trust me.

687
00:57:40,345 --> 00:57:42,315
The cops clipped their ass.

688
00:57:43,485 --> 00:57:44,679
You know how to use that?

689
00:57:46,153 --> 00:57:46,980
Shit.

690
00:57:48,355 --> 00:57:50,614
Point it at me, like you're gonna shoot me.

691
00:57:51,767 --> 00:57:53,044
Go ahead.

692
00:57:54,454 --> 00:57:55,143
Come on.

693
00:57:58,678 --> 00:57:59,977
That's the way you hold a gun.

694
00:58:00,455 --> 00:58:02,024
It's the way I hold it, yeah.

695
00:58:02,656 --> 00:58:06,537
You know how to eject the clip?
Empty it? Clean it?

696
00:58:10,506 --> 00:58:13,183
But the gun's still not empty.
You know that, right?

697
00:58:13,959 --> 00:58:16,514
There is still a round left in the chamber here.

698
00:58:16,950 --> 00:58:18,948
Now, put it back together.

699
00:58:23,462 --> 00:58:24,408
Belailah.

700
00:58:26,332 --> 00:58:29,476
Grasp it. Rub it. Like it's part of you.

701
00:58:31,533 --> 00:58:33,344
Feels good, doesn't it?

702
00:58:33,929 --> 00:58:37,104
Yeah. So oily and what not.

703
00:58:37,238 --> 00:58:38,204
Turn off the safety.

704
00:58:41,858 --> 00:58:43,836
Now cock it.

705
00:58:47,570 --> 00:58:50,495
Now, put it to your temple and pull the fucking trigger.

706
00:58:52,235 --> 00:58:53,968
- What?
- You heard me.

707
00:58:53,969 --> 00:58:55,612
Shoot yourself in the head.

708
00:58:55,613 --> 00:58:57,253
Might as well get it over with now.

709
00:58:57,254 --> 00:58:59,679
Cause you walk around with a gun, sooner or later,

710
00:58:59,680 --> 00:59:01,031
it's gonna happen anyway.

711
00:59:01,032 --> 00:59:01,926
No rewind.

712
00:59:02,021 --> 00:59:04,952
No going after popcorn and coming back to the show.

713
00:59:05,093 --> 00:59:08,827
It's just you with that gun on your
hand, a stupid look on your face...

714
00:59:09,449 --> 00:59:11,578
and your hash all over the wall.

715
00:59:13,106 --> 00:59:14,712
Take it easy now, TJ.

716
00:59:28,373 --> 00:59:30,211
EAST VILLAGE PLUMBING SUPPLY

717
01:00:02,249 --> 01:00:03,783
Ah, fuck!

718
01:00:09,034 --> 01:00:12,782
Scudder, I'm assuming that you're not
dumb enough to shoot a federal agent.

719
01:00:12,783 --> 01:00:15,585
- Show me your badge! Right now!
- Okay.

720
01:00:15,586 --> 01:00:16,877
I'm reaching for my wallet.

721
01:00:19,393 --> 01:00:22,033
Stover, Drug Enforcement.

722
01:00:22,349 --> 01:00:23,351
Put it down!

723
01:00:24,752 --> 01:00:26,005
Great. It's broken.

724
01:00:26,406 --> 01:00:28,312
Next time, identify yourself, okay?

725
01:00:28,313 --> 01:00:29,273
Maybe we should pull over

726
01:00:29,274 --> 01:00:31,130
and try again this time without a sucker punch.

727
01:00:31,131 --> 01:00:32,101
We'll see how you'll do.

728
01:00:32,102 --> 01:00:33,092
Why wait?

729
01:00:33,651 --> 01:00:35,022
Hey, that's enough.

730
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:36,960
Who're you working for?
Kenny Kristo?

731
01:00:36,961 --> 01:00:39,725
- I can't say.
- <i>Cut it out, Scudder.</i>

732
01:00:39,726 --> 01:00:41,715
You're not licensed so you don't have privilege.

733
01:00:41,716 --> 01:00:46,511
And retired. So this gives you 'bout as
much legal authority as a fucking mailman.

734
01:00:47,406 --> 01:00:50,231
So, the sooner you tell me what you're
doing hanging with a known drug dealer,

735
01:00:50,232 --> 01:00:52,984
the sooner you'll get to the AA meeting
and not talk about it.

736
01:00:52,985 --> 01:00:56,052
I'm trying to find Ray and his buddy whats his name.

737
01:00:56,053 --> 01:00:57,959
You know, the two guys that killed Maria Gotteskind?

738
01:00:57,960 --> 01:00:58,915
I don't know who you mean.

739
01:00:58,926 --> 01:01:02,714
Really? They go around saying
they're on the DEA payroll.

740
01:01:02,946 --> 01:01:05,614
It was right before they chopped
someone into little pieces.

741
01:01:05,615 --> 01:01:08,480
- Was Gotteskind looking at Kenny Kristo?
- I can't answer that.

742
01:01:08,481 --> 01:01:10,399
Maybe Mrs Kristo can...

743
01:01:10,488 --> 01:01:13,851
although we haven't seen her around
for a while, have we, guys?

744
01:01:14,372 --> 01:01:15,192
I know...

745
01:01:15,297 --> 01:01:17,963
Maybe you should talk to the brother, Peter.

746
01:01:17,982 --> 01:01:20,842
Seeing he used to spent a lot of time over there.

747
01:01:21,488 --> 01:01:22,779
You know what?

748
01:01:22,942 --> 01:01:26,860
I was wrong. This guy didn't know
a fucking thing. Uncuff him.

749
01:01:28,387 --> 01:01:29,621
We're done here.

750
01:02:01,670 --> 01:02:02,996
In the program, they have this saying.

751
01:02:03,141 --> 01:02:06,780
Don't give up 5 minutes before the miracle happens.

752
01:02:06,868 --> 01:02:07,804
Scudder!

753
01:02:08,144 --> 01:02:10,585
Of course, the flip side of that one is,
if you do give up,...

754
01:02:10,586 --> 01:02:12,644
- ...you'll never know.
- What are you doing here?

755
01:02:16,347 --> 01:02:18,319
I'm admiring your wallpaper.

756
01:02:18,324 --> 01:02:19,344
Oh...

757
01:02:19,914 --> 01:02:22,651
It's a rush.
It's started as we do for a painting.

758
01:02:23,015 --> 01:02:26,012
- You do them all here?
- Yeah. We had to.

759
01:02:26,013 --> 01:02:27,851
Want to be a surprise for Kenny.

760
01:02:27,852 --> 01:02:30,739
Was it? A surprise?

761
01:02:31,613 --> 01:02:32,655
What do you want, man?

762
01:02:33,554 --> 01:02:36,492
You and Carrie put the DEA on to your brother, didn't you?

763
01:02:36,493 --> 01:02:40,303
Hey, I wouldn't blame you for hating the guy, I mean...

764
01:02:40,504 --> 01:02:44,089
It's not just that he has a beautiful wife,
it's not just that he's got all that money,

765
01:02:44,232 --> 01:02:47,931
while you work some
get-well job making donuts.

766
01:02:47,952 --> 01:02:49,463
What really get me...

767
01:02:50,037 --> 01:02:52,732
is how you can be around a whole lot of junk...

768
01:02:53,333 --> 01:02:54,696
and never use.

769
01:02:57,194 --> 01:02:59,430
Carrie had nothing to do with it.

770
01:03:03,778 --> 01:03:07,077
About 9 months ago, they go to Bermuda
for their anniversary.

771
01:03:08,662 --> 01:03:10,174
Carrie asked me to watch the house.

772
01:03:11,810 --> 01:03:13,020
I may as well be dead...

773
01:03:13,470 --> 01:03:17,304
to find some cash Kenny had locked up.
All I was thinking about...

774
01:03:17,332 --> 01:03:20,470
I go to Queens, this guy I know to score.

775
01:03:20,471 --> 01:03:21,475
And you get busted.

776
01:03:22,086 --> 01:03:25,256
Yeah. Get caught in a room with
this woman DEA agent.

777
01:03:26,014 --> 01:03:27,418
She's so nice to me, you know?

778
01:03:28,344 --> 01:03:30,288
And I gave Kenny up like that.

779
01:03:30,289 --> 01:03:33,209
Of course it didn't help that
you're in love with his wife.

780
01:03:33,609 --> 01:03:36,040
Sometimes, I think Kenny left that money on purpose.

781
01:03:36,685 --> 01:03:39,851
Yeah, I'm sure that what it is.

782
01:03:41,236 --> 01:03:43,964
I'm sure this is all exactly what he wanted to happen.

783
01:03:44,600 --> 01:03:45,985
What're you talking' about?

784
01:03:45,986 --> 01:03:47,586
That agent that busted you?

785
01:03:47,969 --> 01:03:49,337
The nice one?

786
01:03:49,628 --> 01:03:51,382
Her name was Marie Gotteskind.

787
01:03:53,162 --> 01:03:55,276
She was killed by the same two men that got Carrie.

788
01:03:55,659 --> 01:03:58,081
- How do you know about this?
- They stole her files.

789
01:03:58,082 --> 01:04:01,025
And one of them, thanks to you, has Kenny's name on it.

790
01:04:06,323 --> 01:04:07,651
Tell your brother I'm done.

791
01:04:08,512 --> 01:04:10,555
I'll return his money tomorrow.

792
01:04:10,831 --> 01:04:12,379
Does Kenny know about me?

793
01:04:13,027 --> 01:04:14,298
Not unless you tell him.

794
01:04:24,893 --> 01:04:27,700
Yo... there goes the bitch ass right there!

795
01:04:27,733 --> 01:04:29,216
Hold up next to him, man.

796
01:04:29,217 --> 01:04:32,479
Yo, TJ!

797
01:04:32,519 --> 01:04:34,369
I know you hear me talking to you, right?

798
01:04:34,434 --> 01:04:35,979
Let's go fuck this boy up.

799
01:04:39,445 --> 01:04:42,044
- Hold your ass, man!
- Whoa. Whao. What's up? What's up?

800
01:04:42,141 --> 01:04:43,938
Yo, we got something 'bout the rules, me man!

801
01:04:43,939 --> 01:04:45,141
What you talking 'bout, man?

802
01:04:45,171 --> 01:04:46,402
Where's my get up, man?
Where's my favourite piece?

803
01:04:46,403 --> 01:04:49,176
- Man, I threw it in the fucking river, man.
- What?!

804
01:04:49,210 --> 01:04:51,891
What do you mean you fucking threw it in the river?

805
01:04:52,019 --> 01:04:54,462
- What are you doing?
- I told you.

806
01:04:54,463 --> 01:04:56,715
- Give me your mother fucking bag!
- Give me that!

807
01:04:58,570 --> 01:05:01,268
- What is all this shit?
- No. No. No. No.

808
01:05:01,273 --> 01:05:02,198
- No, man...
- Shut up!

809
01:05:02,231 --> 01:05:03,990
- Where did you get this money?
- It's my allowance!

810
01:05:04,090 --> 01:05:04,544
You sold my gun?

811
01:05:04,545 --> 01:05:06,886
- No!
- You take the fucking things off, man!

812
01:05:06,903 --> 01:05:07,554
No, man.

813
01:05:08,836 --> 01:05:10,209
What the fuck's wrong with you?

814
01:05:12,591 --> 01:05:14,515
Are you out of your mind?

815
01:05:17,612 --> 01:05:18,967
Any messages?

816
01:05:20,855 --> 01:05:22,408
Yeah, JR called.

817
01:05:22,409 --> 01:05:23,698
TJ?

818
01:05:23,756 --> 01:05:26,636
- Yeah, whatever.
- Did he leave a message?

819
01:05:26,637 --> 01:05:29,413
Let me think... No.

820
01:05:29,633 --> 01:05:32,031
Well, yeah. He's in Belville.

821
01:05:34,274 --> 01:05:36,195
He got worked over pretty good

822
01:05:36,196 --> 01:05:39,266
but he was also out in the rain.
Either one could have triggered the crisis.

823
01:05:39,267 --> 01:05:40,989
- Crisis?
- He's a sickler.

824
01:05:41,629 --> 01:05:43,869
He's got sickle cell anemia.

825
01:05:44,094 --> 01:05:45,745
- You didn't know that?
- No.

826
01:05:45,840 --> 01:05:48,235
When a sickler gets a cold or a chill,

827
01:05:48,236 --> 01:05:51,081
anything that makes a normal person's
blood cell count go up,

828
01:05:51,082 --> 01:05:52,446
anytime the body gets ready to fight something,

829
01:05:52,447 --> 01:05:55,970
the red blood cells panicked and take on a sickle shape,

830
01:05:55,971 --> 01:05:59,176
actually created a kind of traffic jam in the arteries.

831
01:05:59,177 --> 01:06:02,018
The blood gets very thick.
Suddenly, you're not getting any oxygen.

832
01:06:02,019 --> 01:06:03,940
What are you doing for him?

833
01:06:04,141 --> 01:06:07,227
Well, we're hydrating him.
Giving him demerol for the pain.

834
01:06:07,228 --> 01:06:09,083
But he knew the drill.
He got in here early enough.

835
01:06:09,084 --> 01:06:11,569
So, I don't think it will go on for too long.

836
01:06:11,762 --> 01:06:13,603
- I'll be right out there if you need me.
- Thanks.

837
01:06:27,017 --> 01:06:28,791
Don't feel sorry for me.

838
01:06:29,665 --> 01:06:30,714
I don't.

839
01:06:34,509 --> 01:06:38,365
- How long you gotta be here for me?
- Depends on how well you behave.

840
01:06:39,304 --> 01:06:42,237
You know my mom told me once that I've got special blood.

841
01:06:42,813 --> 01:06:44,086
That I can never catch malaria.

842
01:06:44,759 --> 01:06:48,873
It's how sickle cell got started in Africa
as a defense against malaria.

843
01:06:48,874 --> 01:06:49,874
Where is your mother, TJ?

844
01:06:51,082 --> 01:06:52,660
Why aren't you a cop no more?

845
01:06:52,661 --> 01:06:53,653
You first.

846
01:06:57,439 --> 01:07:00,333
I had a crisis once.
I was... I was about 11.

847
01:07:00,557 --> 01:07:04,171
My mom took me to the hospital but
never came back to check me up.

848
01:07:04,763 --> 01:07:06,821
So, I guess she thought that if she left me

849
01:07:06,851 --> 01:07:08,938
there, they'll put me with a really nice family.

850
01:07:09,320 --> 01:07:10,885
Little does she know.

851
01:07:11,268 --> 01:07:13,763
I saw her on the street a few times after that, but...

852
01:07:13,764 --> 01:07:16,560
that... that was a while ago.

853
01:07:17,064 --> 01:07:18,646
She had some issues then.

854
01:07:19,417 --> 01:07:20,461
Your turn.

855
01:07:21,865 --> 01:07:23,858
I was off duty one day.

856
01:07:24,469 --> 01:07:26,520
I was in a bar in Washington Heights where the

857
01:07:26,550 --> 01:07:28,631
cops didn't have to pay for their drinks.

858
01:07:28,632 --> 01:07:29,963
Wait a minute.

859
01:07:30,097 --> 01:07:31,885
Three kids held up the place.

860
01:07:33,491 --> 01:07:36,341
On the way out, they shot the bartender in the heart.

861
01:07:36,643 --> 01:07:38,702
I chased them out into the street...

862
01:07:39,515 --> 01:07:41,478
And I shot two dead...

863
01:07:41,497 --> 01:07:42,423
got the third one in the thigh.

864
01:07:42,424 --> 01:07:44,343
- I heard this already.
- No.

865
01:07:44,756 --> 01:07:46,638
You didn't.

866
01:07:47,135 --> 01:07:50,956
You see, one shot... well,

867
01:07:51,171 --> 01:07:52,903
the bullet took a bad hop.

868
01:08:12,731 --> 01:08:14,894
It hit a 7-year old girl in the eye.

869
01:08:15,903 --> 01:08:17,817
Killed her instantly.

870
01:08:17,818 --> 01:08:20,176
Reach higher and it would have grazed her head.

871
01:08:20,206 --> 01:08:22,594
But the next is gone, that's all.

872
01:08:22,604 --> 01:08:26,644
So, wait. They quit your ass after
you took on 3 baddies by yourself?

873
01:08:27,685 --> 01:08:31,211
They gave me a commendation.
I quit my own ass.

874
01:08:32,698 --> 01:08:34,528
I've never met anybody that type before.

875
01:08:34,529 --> 01:08:35,077
Type?

876
01:08:35,689 --> 01:08:36,958
Brave.

877
01:08:38,536 --> 01:08:39,817
I wasn't brave.

878
01:08:42,144 --> 01:08:43,568
I was just drunk.

879
01:08:46,217 --> 01:08:48,443
Don't feel sorry for me.

880
01:08:51,256 --> 01:08:52,185
I don't.

881
01:08:54,075 --> 01:08:57,009
[Speaking Russian]

882
01:08:59,378 --> 01:09:01,635
Now, please.

883
01:09:40,857 --> 01:09:41,808
Watson?

884
01:09:58,664 --> 01:10:00,288
Watson?

885
01:10:31,487 --> 01:10:33,489
You know how lucky you are?

886
01:10:42,813 --> 01:10:43,999
Scudder.

887
01:10:59,298 --> 01:11:00,249
Hello?

888
01:11:05,043 --> 01:11:06,064
Kenny?

889
01:11:10,137 --> 01:11:11,305
Anybody home?

890
01:11:21,368 --> 01:11:23,563
And where have you been?

891
01:11:25,643 --> 01:11:27,991
- Been trying to call you.
- Where's Kenny?

892
01:11:27,992 --> 01:11:29,351
Whitestone.

893
01:11:29,377 --> 01:11:33,171
With a friend. Says he's having the same
kind of problem's Kenny had.

894
01:11:33,238 --> 01:11:34,141
The wife?

895
01:11:34,642 --> 01:11:35,470
Worse.

896
01:11:42,435 --> 01:11:43,715
I don't have that kind of money.

897
01:11:49,137 --> 01:11:51,363
- You're the detective, right?
- Matt Scudder.

898
01:11:51,875 --> 01:11:54,291
Dani, why don't you go outside and keep an eye out.

899
01:11:54,779 --> 01:11:56,148
That's a good boy.

900
01:11:57,637 --> 01:11:58,985
Now, I have to post guards.

901
01:11:59,918 --> 01:12:03,783
The horses don't run far.
I locked the barn. For what?

902
01:12:03,784 --> 01:12:05,757
Huh? What can they take from me now?

903
01:12:05,808 --> 01:12:07,414
She's 14 years old.

904
01:12:07,415 --> 01:12:08,557
14.

905
01:12:08,847 --> 01:12:11,427
This is Anna, the nurse.

906
01:12:12,524 --> 01:12:14,300
They took her last night.

907
01:12:14,960 --> 01:12:16,368
Called us in the morning and

908
01:12:16,977 --> 01:12:18,257
tells us not to call the police.

909
01:12:19,097 --> 01:12:22,843
I remember Kenny called up the other day.
So I... I put two and two together,

910
01:12:22,844 --> 01:12:25,772
Mr Landau, listen. You have to know that..

911
01:12:25,773 --> 01:12:27,709
I'm sorry. What's your daughter's name?

912
01:12:27,710 --> 01:12:30,586
Lucmina. She calls herself Lucia.

913
01:12:31,224 --> 01:12:35,341
You have to know that the men that took
Lucia had already killed at least 2 women

914
01:12:35,342 --> 01:12:37,265
including Kenny's wife.

915
01:12:38,182 --> 01:12:42,610
The next stand. They haven't the slightest
intention of releasing your daughter alive.

916
01:12:43,000 --> 01:12:46,860
And that... there's a strong possibility
that she's already dead.

917
01:12:46,861 --> 01:12:48,709
- No.
- The police know about these two.

918
01:12:48,710 --> 01:12:50,239
They know who they are.
They know what they're doing.

919
01:12:50,240 --> 01:12:51,606
No, no, no. No police.

920
01:12:52,607 --> 01:12:56,433
You have to help me. Kenny said you would.
I'll pay.

921
01:12:56,434 --> 01:12:57,455
I'll do whatever you ask.

922
01:12:58,488 --> 01:12:59,451
Please.

923
01:13:07,903 --> 01:13:10,743
- Hello?
- <i>Okay, you know what happens next?</i>

924
01:13:10,982 --> 01:13:13,603
Yes. Please, I'm trying...
I'm working on it...

925
01:13:13,604 --> 01:13:15,552
<i>Go work harder, Yuri.
We want our money.</i>

926
01:13:15,553 --> 01:13:18,420
I just need some time.
Please, I'll give you whatever you want.

927
01:13:18,421 --> 01:13:20,912
But, please, one thing I want is to talk to my daughter.

928
01:13:20,913 --> 01:13:23,672
- <i>She can't talk right now.</i>
- You gotta let me talk to...

929
01:13:24,753 --> 01:13:27,012
If she's dead, you get nothing.

930
01:13:27,147 --> 01:13:28,964
<i>And who the fuck are you?</i>

931
01:13:29,348 --> 01:13:31,956
I'm the best chance you've got if you
wanna get your money.

932
01:13:32,370 --> 01:13:35,952
But the girl's gotta be alive and all in
one piece for any kind of deal to happen.

933
01:13:36,599 --> 01:13:38,506
Are you listening, motherfucker?

934
01:13:39,720 --> 01:13:41,379
<i>Fuck this shit.</i>

935
01:13:44,650 --> 01:13:46,001
I can't believe you talked to him like that.

936
01:13:46,031 --> 01:13:47,411
He knows what he's doing.

937
01:13:47,519 --> 01:13:49,790
The important thing right now is to keep Lucia alive.

938
01:13:49,791 --> 01:13:51,723
That means these guys have to know that they can't get a

939
01:13:51,740 --> 01:13:53,688
nickle out of you until we first know that she's okay.

940
01:13:53,689 --> 01:13:56,256
- What if you make them mad...
- They are already mad.

941
01:13:56,257 --> 01:13:57,617
You... you're giving them an excuse to kill her.

942
01:13:57,618 --> 01:14:00,508
They don't need an excuse.
They're gonna kill her anyway.

943
01:14:00,795 --> 01:14:03,330
All they need is a reason to keep her alive.

944
01:14:03,331 --> 01:14:07,154
- How much cash we've got?
- I don't have that much right now, but

945
01:14:07,158 --> 01:14:10,198
do these bastards want cocaine? Because
I got 15 kilos ten minutes from here.

946
01:14:11,632 --> 01:14:15,767
I don't know, maybe I can get my hands on
a few hundred in counterfeit but...

947
01:14:15,877 --> 01:14:18,485
I can't guarantee the quality and I have to return it.

948
01:14:18,486 --> 01:14:20,166
You'll need at least five hundred in cash.

949
01:14:21,606 --> 01:14:23,457
When the time comes, I'll go get it.

950
01:14:23,458 --> 01:14:25,370
Is there another line I can use?

951
01:14:26,050 --> 01:14:27,572
There's a phone in my daughter's room.

952
01:14:33,684 --> 01:14:35,850
<i>Culpepper Investigation, Dante speaking.</i>

953
01:14:35,851 --> 01:14:36,969
Where the hell are you?

954
01:14:36,970 --> 01:14:38,757
In my office, man. What's up?

955
01:14:38,758 --> 01:14:39,998
Why did you leave the hospital?

956
01:14:40,030 --> 01:14:44,464
I don't want some social services person
come hauling my ass away to a foster home.

957
01:14:44,465 --> 01:14:47,368
I need you to do me a favour and get
me some muck out of my apartment.

958
01:14:47,369 --> 01:14:48,311
What's going on?

959
01:14:48,426 --> 01:14:51,958
There's a box up on my closet.
I want you to get it for me.

960
01:14:51,959 --> 01:14:54,069
The kid at the front desk will let you up.

961
01:14:54,107 --> 01:14:56,860
<i>Apartment 11G, key's above the door.</i>

962
01:14:56,863 --> 01:14:59,826
A guy named Peter will meet you out front.
Give it to him.

963
01:14:59,827 --> 01:15:01,827
And then, get back to whatever it is you're doing.

964
01:15:10,346 --> 01:15:11,282
Hello?

965
01:15:12,267 --> 01:15:13,917
<i>I understand we have a new player in the game.</i>

966
01:15:13,947 --> 01:15:15,627
<i>I don't believe we've been introduced.</i>

967
01:15:15,752 --> 01:15:18,056
I'm a friend of Mr Landau.
My name is not important.

968
01:15:18,057 --> 01:15:21,718
I'm assuming that Mr Landau's not
dumb enough to speak to the police?

969
01:15:21,766 --> 01:15:22,696
He hasn't.

970
01:15:22,793 --> 01:15:23,724
<i>Then who are you?</i>

971
01:15:23,725 --> 01:15:25,590
One likes to know who's on the other side.

972
01:15:25,591 --> 01:15:28,508
We're on the same side.
We both want this to happen.

973
01:15:28,509 --> 01:15:30,710
<i>Good. Then, all you gotta to
do is follow instructions.</i>

974
01:15:30,756 --> 01:15:32,323
No. It's not that simple.

975
01:15:32,705 --> 01:15:35,329
Of course, it is. We tell
you what to do and you

976
01:15:35,359 --> 01:15:38,013
do it if you ever want to see the girl again.

977
01:15:38,014 --> 01:15:40,232
You'll have to convince me that
she's alive in the first place.

978
01:15:40,233 --> 01:15:41,852
You have my word on it.

979
01:15:42,846 --> 01:15:45,315
- <i>That's funny.</i>
- Why, it's not good enough?

980
01:15:45,316 --> 01:15:47,555
Let's just say you've lost a lot of credibility

981
01:15:47,585 --> 01:15:49,854
when you returned Mrs Kristo in poor condition.

982
01:15:50,447 --> 01:15:52,800
There were special circumstances regarding Mrs Kristo.

983
01:15:52,830 --> 01:15:55,213
Her husband tried to haggle with me.

984
01:15:55,214 --> 01:15:58,532
Sliced the price.
We, in turn, I don't know, you...

985
01:15:58,562 --> 01:16:01,910
...can finish it up all for yourself, can't you?

986
01:16:01,981 --> 01:16:03,846
We are not going to argue the price.

987
01:16:03,934 --> 01:16:05,210
<i>You will pay the million?</i>

988
01:16:05,437 --> 01:16:06,732
For the girl alive and well.

989
01:16:07,411 --> 01:16:08,669
<i>I assure you she's both.</i>

990
01:16:09,263 --> 01:16:13,095
Your assurance mean shit to me. Put her
on the phone, let her father talk to her.

991
01:16:13,096 --> 01:16:16,283
Uh, I'm afraid I won't be able to put her
on the phone right now.

992
01:16:16,284 --> 01:16:18,156
Please deposit 25 cents.

993
01:16:18,157 --> 01:16:20,398
Out of quarters? Give me your number,
I'll call you back.

994
01:16:33,533 --> 01:16:36,312
- Yeah?
- <i>I'm afraid the girl cannot come to the phone.</i>

995
01:16:36,313 --> 01:16:37,373
<i>That's out of the question.</i>

996
01:16:37,374 --> 01:16:40,302
<i>How else can we re-assure you of her well-being?</i>

997
01:16:40,327 --> 01:16:41,490
Wait.

998
01:16:42,073 --> 01:16:44,041
Tell me something your daughter would know.

999
01:16:44,638 --> 01:16:45,984
The dog. His name.

1000
01:16:45,985 --> 01:16:46,850
They could know that.

1001
01:16:47,137 --> 01:16:48,967
They've been following her.
They know your schedule.

1002
01:16:48,997 --> 01:16:50,857
They'd probably seen her walking the dog.

1003
01:16:50,963 --> 01:16:53,833
Heard her called him by name.
Think of something else.

1004
01:16:54,227 --> 01:16:59,356
We have dog before this one. A little
black and white one. It got hit by a car.

1005
01:17:01,183 --> 01:17:04,773
The dog's name, and the name of the dog before this one.

1006
01:17:04,774 --> 01:17:08,014
Have her describe both of them and call me back.

1007
01:17:50,475 --> 01:17:52,313
For 16 years, we were married.

1008
01:17:53,459 --> 01:17:55,862
I don't even remember her even having a cold.

1009
01:17:56,741 --> 01:17:58,376
Then, one day, she wakes up and

1010
01:17:58,902 --> 01:18:00,709
says she can't smell anything.

1011
01:18:04,073 --> 01:18:05,085
You're a policeman?

1012
01:18:05,086 --> 01:18:06,747
Yeah, I was.

1013
01:18:07,971 --> 01:18:09,411
You dealt with situations like this?

1014
01:18:10,641 --> 01:18:12,377
No. Not like this.

1015
01:18:12,648 --> 01:18:14,668
Still, your gut must be telling you something?

1016
01:18:15,613 --> 01:18:17,944
How was it getting you now?
She alive?

1017
01:18:25,410 --> 01:18:25,910
Yeah?

1018
01:18:26,116 --> 01:18:28,352
<i>It's good to know how you figure out all this.</i>

1019
01:18:28,591 --> 01:18:30,215
Tell me the dog's name.

1020
01:18:30,216 --> 01:18:32,224
Oh, well. Let's see.

1021
01:18:33,468 --> 01:18:35,018
What would it sounds like, huh?

1022
01:18:35,688 --> 01:18:37,924
Fido? Towser? King?

1023
01:18:37,925 --> 01:18:40,736
<i>Rover. That's always a popular choice.</i>

1024
01:18:40,822 --> 01:18:44,582
<i>Hey. I know what it is. How about Bingo?</i>

1025
01:18:45,281 --> 01:18:48,393
<i>What about Spot, huh?</i>
Run, Spot, run.

1026
01:18:48,400 --> 01:18:51,110
Not a bad name for a Rottweiler.

1027
01:18:51,111 --> 01:18:53,181
- <i>The dog's name is Watson.</i>
- Watson.

1028
01:18:55,064 --> 01:18:57,068
And the other dog?
The one before.

1029
01:18:57,603 --> 01:18:59,378
She couldn't tell what breed the other dog was.

1030
01:18:59,408 --> 01:19:01,213
She was young when it died.

1031
01:19:01,748 --> 01:19:03,688
They had it put to sleep, she said.

1032
01:19:04,071 --> 01:19:05,751
It's a silly term for it, don't you think?

1033
01:19:06,207 --> 01:19:08,289
I mean, you gonna kill someone, you ought to have

1034
01:19:08,319 --> 01:19:10,430
the courtesy to say that's what you're doing.

1035
01:19:11,879 --> 01:19:14,259
- <i>You're not talking. You're still there?</i>
- I'm here.

1036
01:19:14,751 --> 01:19:18,084
I gather it's a mongol. So many of us are.

1037
01:19:18,085 --> 01:19:20,888
Now, the name although may be a problem.
I may not have it right.

1038
01:19:20,984 --> 01:19:23,846
It's a Russian word.
How's your Russian, my friend?

1039
01:19:23,885 --> 01:19:25,065
Tell me.

1040
01:19:26,654 --> 01:19:29,611
I may be saying this wrong. Balalaika.

1041
01:19:29,631 --> 01:19:30,824
Balalaika.

1042
01:19:31,185 --> 01:19:34,456
<i>The name of a musical instrument, so she tells me.</i>

1043
01:19:34,728 --> 01:19:38,188
What do you say, pal?
Does this strike a chord?

1044
01:19:41,717 --> 01:19:44,923
You got 2 hours to get the money together.

1045
01:19:54,131 --> 01:19:55,374
TJ?

1046
01:20:37,466 --> 01:20:41,293
- TJ? What are you doing here?
- Had to give you this.

1047
01:20:41,294 --> 01:20:44,173
I told you to give it to Peter, not to come down here.

1048
01:20:45,048 --> 01:20:48,972
Matthew, that dude was sponge. There's
no way I was going to give it to him.

1049
01:20:49,435 --> 01:20:50,032
Later.

1050
01:20:53,425 --> 01:20:55,718
- How much have we got?
- Hang on for a second.

1051
01:20:58,709 --> 01:21:00,857
Holy fucking shit.

1052
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:04,750
This is, er, TJ, my associate.

1053
01:21:07,570 --> 01:21:10,493
It looks good. Ink's looks right.
It's nice if they don't...

1054
01:21:10,494 --> 01:21:12,404
This looks real enough.

1055
01:21:12,881 --> 01:21:14,091
We repack them some slightly.

1056
01:21:14,286 --> 01:21:16,622
We rused the bank robbers to protect 6 billions out

1057
01:21:16,652 --> 01:21:19,017
of each bank and replaced them with the real ones.

1058
01:21:19,018 --> 01:21:20,498
Three on top and three on the bottom.

1059
01:21:20,573 --> 01:21:21,926
What's this make the count?

1060
01:21:21,927 --> 01:21:27,722
- I got at least 200 could go another six...
- Just right about eight.

1061
01:21:28,103 --> 01:21:28,947
It's good enough.

1062
01:21:31,518 --> 01:21:35,381
<i>We have to meet face to face. You got
the opportunity to inspect the money.</i>

1063
01:21:35,928 --> 01:21:37,806
<i>We get to see that the girl's all right.</i>

1064
01:21:37,834 --> 01:21:41,094
- And then you people come down on us.
- <i>You'll have the girl covered.</i>

1065
01:21:41,112 --> 01:21:42,622
A knife at her throat?

1066
01:21:42,623 --> 01:21:45,877
- If you want.
- <i>The edge of a blade cut up under her windpipe?</i>

1067
01:21:45,879 --> 01:21:46,804
Whatever.

1068
01:21:46,836 --> 01:21:49,294
Yeah, I don't like this face to face business.

1069
01:21:49,295 --> 01:21:50,676
<i>We'll set up 50 yards apart.</i>

1070
01:21:51,212 --> 01:21:53,545
You'll be in place first.
You'll see us arrive.

1071
01:21:53,753 --> 01:21:56,511
You show the girl and I come over with the money.

1072
01:21:56,827 --> 01:21:58,356
- By yourself?
- <i>Yes.</i>

1073
01:21:59,169 --> 01:22:00,219
Unarmed?

1074
01:22:00,240 --> 01:22:04,000
With a suitcase full of money in each hand,
a gun won't do me much good.

1075
01:22:04,670 --> 01:22:06,018
Keep talking.

1076
01:22:06,410 --> 01:22:10,235
You check the money. When you're satisfied,
you let the girl go.

1077
01:22:10,340 --> 01:22:14,494
Your man takes off with the cash.
You and I wait until you feel good,

1078
01:22:15,412 --> 01:22:16,770
then we go home.

1079
01:22:17,381 --> 01:22:18,355
You're gonna grab me.

1080
01:22:18,356 --> 01:22:22,701
You have that knife you keep talking about.
I've done two if you want one.

1081
01:22:22,834 --> 01:22:25,978
- <i>You'll see my face.</i>
- Wear a mask.

1082
01:22:25,979 --> 01:22:27,970
<i>It cuts the visibility.</i>

1083
01:22:28,554 --> 01:22:31,880
I already know what you looked like, Ray.

1084
01:22:33,607 --> 01:22:35,594
What do you know?

1085
01:22:36,193 --> 01:22:40,327
I know you're a genetic fuck-up who
fight men in the streets ten years ago.

1086
01:22:40,328 --> 01:22:42,268
I just thrown you out of a fucking window.

1087
01:22:42,269 --> 01:22:43,261
<i>Be careful.</i>

1088
01:22:43,385 --> 01:22:44,855
It's been a busy year for you and your boyfriend.

1089
01:22:44,856 --> 01:22:46,864
<i>You know I could cut the little cunt's throat.</i>

1090
01:22:46,894 --> 01:22:48,932
<i>Send it back to daddy, a chunk at a time.</i>

1091
01:22:48,933 --> 01:22:51,804
- And you're dead.
- <i>Oh?</i>

1092
01:22:51,805 --> 01:22:52,791
Yeah... oh.

1093
01:22:53,126 --> 01:22:55,485
You want your money or you want to be looking behind

1094
01:22:55,515 --> 01:22:57,904
you for the rest of your worthless fucking life?

1095
01:22:58,490 --> 01:23:01,483
Do this deal and I'll see nobody knows about you.

1096
01:23:02,029 --> 01:23:05,259
You can take your little Burton-Ernie act
to the other side of the country.

1097
01:23:05,405 --> 01:23:07,185
There's plenty of dope dealers in L.A.

1098
01:23:14,775 --> 01:23:16,547
Where do you want to do it?

1099
01:23:16,738 --> 01:23:18,654
How about Green-Wood Cemetery?

1100
01:23:19,324 --> 01:23:20,604
Yeah, I think I know that place.

1101
01:23:20,845 --> 01:23:24,391
<i>You should.
That's where you dumped Leila Andresen.</i>

1102
01:23:24,552 --> 01:23:27,250
There's two entrances on the 5th Avenue side.

1103
01:23:27,251 --> 01:23:31,842
Take the 35th street entrance and
head south about 20 yards inside the fence.

1104
01:23:31,843 --> 01:23:34,924
We'll enter at 25th and approach it from there.

1105
01:23:35,220 --> 01:23:39,705
Say, er, 10:30. <i>It gives you over
an hour to get there and set up.</i>

1106
01:23:39,992 --> 01:23:43,557
Leila. Was that her name?

1107
01:23:43,558 --> 01:23:45,486
I would think you'd remember.

1108
01:23:45,487 --> 01:23:48,342
No. Once they're in the van,
they're just body parts.

1109
01:23:48,817 --> 01:23:52,165
- 10:30.
- <i>Oh, God. She was so scared.</i>

1110
01:23:54,535 --> 01:23:56,851
- Have you got a rifle?
- Dani.

1111
01:23:57,739 --> 01:24:01,633
- He's a good shot?
- Back then maybe. I think he's a little near-sighted.

1112
01:24:01,770 --> 01:24:03,556
Peter was in the army.

1113
01:24:06,913 --> 01:24:08,334
Yeah. It was a while ago, man.

1114
01:24:09,375 --> 01:24:13,200
Give him the rifle. Keep Dani and
the other one here with your wife.

1115
01:24:13,862 --> 01:24:15,640
We don't want to spook our friends.

1116
01:24:38,884 --> 01:24:40,840
<i>Who would like to read the 12 steps?</i>

1117
01:24:48,097 --> 01:24:51,346
- Hi, I'm Sarah. I'm an alcoholic.
- <i>Hi, Sarah.</i>

1118
01:24:53,245 --> 01:24:54,259
<i>Step One.</i>

1119
01:24:54,787 --> 01:24:58,026
<i>We admit it we're powerless over alcohol.</i>

1120
01:24:58,060 --> 01:25:00,924
<i>That our lives have became unmanageable.</i>

1121
01:25:37,824 --> 01:25:39,887
- What's the drill?
- Stay in the car and lock the doors.

1122
01:25:39,917 --> 01:25:42,009
Call 911 if anything goes down.

1123
01:25:42,010 --> 01:25:43,934
This is such a bullshit.

1124
01:25:46,795 --> 01:25:48,801
<i>Step Two.</i>

1125
01:25:49,706 --> 01:25:54,486
<i>Came to believe that a power greater
than ourselves can restore us the sanity.</i>

1126
01:26:26,973 --> 01:26:27,985
<i>That's far enough.</i>

1127
01:26:28,080 --> 01:26:29,878
Come out where I can see you.

1128
01:26:30,130 --> 01:26:30,834
Show me the girl.

1129
01:26:30,835 --> 01:26:32,874
I got a knife to her throat.

1130
01:26:33,381 --> 01:26:35,709
- If my hand slips...
- Let's hope it doesn't.

1131
01:26:36,496 --> 01:26:38,409
Is that our money?

1132
01:26:43,386 --> 01:26:45,223
<i>Step Three.</i>

1133
01:26:45,517 --> 01:26:48,194
<i>Make the decision to turn up well in our lives</i>

1134
01:26:48,224 --> 01:26:50,931
<i>over to the care of God as we understood Him.</i>

1135
01:26:53,750 --> 01:26:54,951
Now. Let her go.

1136
01:26:54,961 --> 01:26:57,107
We ought to just shoot this cocksucker.

1137
01:26:57,108 --> 01:26:59,523
Don't change the rules now, Ray.

1138
01:27:05,230 --> 01:27:06,225
Let her go.

1139
01:27:08,109 --> 01:27:10,048
Sweet Lucy.

1140
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:12,918
I hate to see you go.

1141
01:27:15,119 --> 01:27:17,673
Lucia, walk towards me.

1142
01:27:17,810 --> 01:27:19,896
Your father's just over here, Lucia.

1143
01:27:25,351 --> 01:27:27,191
<i>Step Four.</i>

1144
01:27:27,703 --> 01:27:30,564
- What's the matter with her hand?
- Nothing. She's bright as rain.

1145
01:27:30,565 --> 01:27:34,913
<i>Make the searching and fearless
moral inventory of ourselves.</i>

1146
01:27:40,273 --> 01:27:42,562
It's before you set the terms.

1147
01:27:44,477 --> 01:27:47,461
Go to your dad. Go to your dad, baby.

1148
01:27:54,286 --> 01:27:56,393
Go on. Get out of here.

1149
01:27:59,899 --> 01:28:02,238
I like her. She was nice.

1150
01:28:07,428 --> 01:28:09,746
What the fuck is the matter with you, man?

1151
01:28:09,828 --> 01:28:12,141
<i>Why aren't you afraid?</i>

1152
01:28:12,247 --> 01:28:13,274
I don't know.

1153
01:28:14,123 --> 01:28:17,001
Maybe I don't care if you shoot me or not.

1154
01:28:17,594 --> 01:28:20,941
Or maybe there's a high powered
rifle pointed at your head.

1155
01:28:28,455 --> 01:28:30,403
- I can still kill you.
- I'm right here.

1156
01:28:31,551 --> 01:28:34,208
In some ways, you'll be doing me a big favour.

1157
01:28:35,867 --> 01:28:39,064
Nah. It don't pay to be shot.

1158
01:28:40,656 --> 01:28:41,906
They fucked us.

1159
01:28:42,102 --> 01:28:42,881
Shoot him!

1160
01:28:44,371 --> 01:28:45,737
<i>Step Five.</i>

1161
01:28:45,738 --> 01:28:48,771
<i>Admit it to God, to ourselves and to another</i>

1162
01:28:48,801 --> 01:28:51,863
<i>human being with exact nature of our lives.</i>

1163
01:29:04,473 --> 01:29:05,443
<i>Step Six.</i>

1164
01:29:05,444 --> 01:29:09,929
<i>We're entirely ready to have God
remove all these demons and characters.</i>

1165
01:29:11,558 --> 01:29:13,471
<i>Peter!</i>

1166
01:29:22,083 --> 01:29:23,907
<i>Step Seven.</i>

1167
01:29:23,908 --> 01:29:26,863
<i>Humbly ask Him to remove our shortcomings.</i>

1168
01:29:34,503 --> 01:29:35,482
<i>Step Eight.</i>

1169
01:29:35,524 --> 01:29:38,015
<i>Make a list of all the persons we have harmed</i>

1170
01:29:38,045 --> 01:29:40,565
<i>and became well into making amends to them all.</i>

1171
01:29:58,039 --> 01:29:59,362
Don't move.

1172
01:29:59,363 --> 01:30:02,829
- Kenny, I got to tell you...
- It's okay.

1173
01:30:02,873 --> 01:30:04,756
You gotta know.

1174
01:30:05,681 --> 01:30:08,675
- I loved...
- <i>Step Nine.</i>

1175
01:30:09,097 --> 01:30:11,776
<i>Make direct amends to such people...</i>

1176
01:30:12,415 --> 01:30:17,000
- I love...
- I love you too, brother.

1177
01:30:21,000 --> 01:30:24,365
<i>Except want to do so, would injure them or others.</i>

1178
01:30:29,032 --> 01:30:30,376
Which way did they go?

1179
01:30:35,868 --> 01:30:37,732
He shot me!

1180
01:30:42,446 --> 01:30:43,457
TJ?

1181
01:30:43,467 --> 01:30:45,314
Oh, Christ!

1182
01:30:45,923 --> 01:30:48,114
He must have panicked when he heard the shooting.

1183
01:30:48,115 --> 01:30:51,117
He can't be out in this rain.
We have to find him.

1184
01:30:51,158 --> 01:30:52,807
He's got a phone, right?

1185
01:31:20,198 --> 01:31:23,130
Come on... Albert.

1186
01:31:38,516 --> 01:31:39,377
Shit!

1187
01:31:43,309 --> 01:31:45,092
Hello?

1188
01:31:46,190 --> 01:31:47,115
Oh, fuck!

1189
01:31:48,264 --> 01:31:49,155
TJ.

1190
01:31:49,190 --> 01:31:51,420
<i>Scudder, I got in the van.
They don't know I'm here.</i>

1191
01:31:51,421 --> 01:31:53,289
Listen to me. Get out from there... now.

1192
01:31:53,461 --> 01:31:56,774
- It's cool. I'm in the garage and they're in the house.
- Which is where?

1193
01:31:56,785 --> 01:31:58,667
Sit.

1194
01:31:59,625 --> 01:32:02,367
I've never been shot before.

1195
01:32:02,497 --> 01:32:04,856
There's a first aid kit in the bathroom.

1196
01:32:38,291 --> 01:32:40,137
Hey, I don't see any numbers.

1197
01:32:40,138 --> 01:32:41,154
<i>Try next door.</i>

1198
01:32:42,580 --> 01:32:45,000
Er, 6-9-7. Wait, no. 6-9-2.

1199
01:32:45,001 --> 01:32:46,898
<i>Okay. Now walk away from the house.</i>

1200
01:32:47,280 --> 01:32:48,825
<i>Go to the corner.</i>

1201
01:32:50,398 --> 01:32:52,588
- Is any of that real?
- Some.

1202
01:33:03,803 --> 01:33:06,568
Er... 51st Street and Church Avenue.

1203
01:33:06,610 --> 01:33:09,860
- Borough Park.
- It's not even a mile from here.

1204
01:33:09,968 --> 01:33:11,440
<i>Stay put, you hear me?</i>

1205
01:33:11,492 --> 01:33:13,276
Here.

1206
01:33:26,042 --> 01:33:26,747
Hey, who's...?

1207
01:33:31,470 --> 01:33:34,310
Shit... Shit... Shit.

1208
01:35:05,166 --> 01:35:06,538
You can have your money back.

1209
01:35:07,199 --> 01:35:08,469
He's downstairs.

1210
01:35:35,228 --> 01:35:37,149
You're the husband.

1211
01:35:37,334 --> 01:35:38,122
So?

1212
01:35:38,451 --> 01:35:39,506
I'm just wondering.

1213
01:35:39,697 --> 01:35:41,258
You're just gonna leave Ray down there?

1214
01:35:41,613 --> 01:35:42,555
No.

1215
01:35:42,976 --> 01:35:44,908
He's gonna get something to eat.

1216
01:35:45,664 --> 01:35:47,682
I was gonna clean up before I left.

1217
01:35:47,775 --> 01:35:49,578
<i>What were you gonna do with him?</i>

1218
01:35:49,865 --> 01:35:50,821
Chop him up...

1219
01:35:51,184 --> 01:35:54,290
<i>wrap him, put the bags in the cupboard.</i>

1220
01:35:54,291 --> 01:35:57,150
And then what? Delivering it to
somebody in the trunk of a car?

1221
01:35:57,151 --> 01:35:58,682
No.

1222
01:35:59,089 --> 01:36:01,008
That was just for you.

1223
01:36:02,255 --> 01:36:03,918
He's not yours tonight, Kenny.

1224
01:36:04,798 --> 01:36:07,746
There's a lot a hard evidence against this asshole.

1225
01:36:07,781 --> 01:36:09,659
He's got his dead buddy in the basement.

1226
01:36:09,945 --> 01:36:12,002
Not to mention the van in the garage.

1227
01:36:12,193 --> 01:36:16,449
It's gonna be lots of fibres and blood
traces and God knows, what else.

1228
01:36:16,908 --> 01:36:19,953
He ought be looking at 3 life sentences.

1229
01:36:19,983 --> 01:36:23,058
Personally, 20 or 30 years tagged on as a bonus.

1230
01:36:24,459 --> 01:36:28,256
And what about the other choice?
You and me?

1231
01:36:32,098 --> 01:36:33,078
No.

1232
01:36:34,014 --> 01:36:36,452
I could turn him in, I'll sleep just fine.

1233
01:36:36,453 --> 01:36:37,867
I don't think I could.

1234
01:36:37,868 --> 01:36:40,714
That's why it has to be your decision.

1235
01:36:42,620 --> 01:36:44,543
Then, I guess I just made it.

1236
01:36:46,740 --> 01:36:48,644
Take it easy, man.

1237
01:36:56,665 --> 01:36:57,396
Come on.

1238
01:37:05,578 --> 01:37:07,786
You know, I could help you with that hand.

1239
01:37:10,608 --> 01:37:11,944
Will you?

1240
01:38:18,455 --> 01:38:22,050
Shelter's gonna be closed.
Wait for me back at my place.

1241
01:38:22,051 --> 01:38:24,196
- Where are you going?
- Just do as I say.

1242
01:38:35,157 --> 01:38:36,724
<i>Step Ten.</i>

1243
01:38:36,725 --> 01:38:41,235
<i>Continue to take personal inventory and
when we were wrong, calmly admitted it.</i>

1244
01:38:42,175 --> 01:38:43,415
<i>Step Eleven.</i>

1245
01:38:43,686 --> 01:38:46,736
<i>Start your prayer and meditation to improve our</i>

1246
01:38:46,766 --> 01:38:49,845
<i>conscious contact with God as we understand Him,</i>

1247
01:38:49,923 --> 01:38:54,606
<i>praying only for the knowledge of His will
to us and the power to carry that out.</i>

1248
01:38:56,121 --> 01:38:57,072
<i>Step Twelve.</i>

1249
01:38:57,073 --> 01:39:01,238
<i>Having had a spiritual awakenings
as a result from these steps,</i>

1250
01:39:01,239 --> 01:39:04,175
<i>we try to carry this message to alcoholics</i>

1251
01:39:04,284 --> 01:39:07,952
<i>and to practice these principles in all our affairs.</i>

1252
01:39:39,664 --> 01:39:40,567
Kenny?

1253
01:42:39,466 --> 01:42:40,564
You know what?

1254
01:42:41,694 --> 01:42:43,614
I just wanted...
