<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:01:27,552 --> 00:01:29,018
-Come here.
-Okay.

4
00:01:31,222 --> 00:01:33,593
We did it. We did it!

5
00:01:33,626 --> 00:01:35,328
-Yeah! Whoo!
-Whoo!

6
00:01:45,771 --> 00:01:48,641
<i>Miss me? It took you
forever to get me.</i>

7
00:01:48,674 --> 00:01:50,343
<i>Worst part? Best part?</i>

8
00:01:50,376 --> 00:01:53,746
<i>There is no best part.
That family sucked.</i>

9
00:01:53,778 --> 00:01:56,448
<i>You should be with me.
I'm family. I'm 18 now.</i>

10
00:02:30,782 --> 00:02:32,350
Glory.

11
00:02:32,383 --> 00:02:35,187
Glory, honey, come on.
It's time for sleep.

12
00:02:35,221 --> 00:02:37,048
Glory. Come on, sweetie pie,
it's time to go to sleep.

13
00:02:37,049 --> 00:02:37,657
No!

14
00:02:37,689 --> 00:02:39,358
-It's time for sleep. Come on.
-No!

15
00:02:39,390 --> 00:02:41,727
-No!
-Come on, listen to Mommy.

16
00:02:41,759 --> 00:02:43,195
Come on, sweetie.
It's okay.

17
00:02:50,235 --> 00:02:51,905
She's down.

18
00:03:04,316 --> 00:03:07,219
I can't keep on moving these
balances around, it's...

19
00:03:07,252 --> 00:03:08,520
Just think about
all the money we save.

20
00:03:08,554 --> 00:03:10,656
Never having help before,

21
00:03:10,688 --> 00:03:12,290
me doing everything myself.

22
00:03:14,293 --> 00:03:16,695
I'm sorry. That makes it
sound like I don't do anything

23
00:03:16,729 --> 00:03:18,764
and I happen to be...
I work, okay?

24
00:03:18,796 --> 00:03:21,834
What the hell do you
think I do all day?

25
00:03:21,866 --> 00:03:24,436
Get my nails done.
Talk about boys.

26
00:03:24,469 --> 00:03:27,706
Yeah, well, you know, it's not
like I dreamt about being an IT guy.

27
00:03:27,740 --> 00:03:28,540
At least
you're out in the world.

28
00:03:29,540 --> 00:03:31,243
I'm "out in the world"?

29
00:03:31,276 --> 00:03:32,844
I work in a cubicle, Kay.
A cubicle.

30
00:03:32,877 --> 00:03:34,246
-A cubicle?
-Yeah.

31
00:03:34,280 --> 00:03:35,781
-A cubicle sounds heavenly.
-Really?

32
00:03:35,813 --> 00:03:38,350
You have no idea
what I do all day.

33
00:03:38,383 --> 00:03:39,751
No, I don't have any idea
what you do all day,

34
00:03:39,784 --> 00:03:42,288
because you don't tell me
what you do all day.

35
00:03:42,320 --> 00:03:43,521
I mean, are we gluten free
this week?

36
00:03:43,555 --> 00:03:44,522
"Yes, we're gluten-free
this week."

37
00:03:44,556 --> 00:03:46,259
Well, then why the hell
is she having Sun Chips?

38
00:03:48,794 --> 00:03:52,665
Because sometimes you just have
to avoid a total meltdown.

39
00:04:13,985 --> 00:04:15,820
Glory, stop.
You see this face?

40
00:04:15,854 --> 00:04:18,357
This is Daddy's angry face.

41
00:04:18,389 --> 00:04:20,026
Time to sleep, Glory.

42
00:04:20,059 --> 00:04:22,395
I guess I'll sleep
in here, okay.

43
00:04:37,608 --> 00:04:39,344
U.2.T...

44
00:04:39,377 --> 00:04:41,046
Hey, when do I get my tattoo?

45
00:04:41,079 --> 00:04:43,315
You can't handle it.
You're afraid of paper cuts.

46
00:04:45,016 --> 00:04:47,552
Hey, she's like my twin.

47
00:04:47,586 --> 00:04:49,989
Yeah. Totally.
Exactly like you.

48
00:04:52,990 --> 00:04:54,793
Hey, support the Red Cross.

49
00:04:56,627 --> 00:04:57,896
-Thank you.
-Yeah.

50
00:05:00,932 --> 00:05:02,435
-Two...
-Two...

51
00:05:02,468 --> 00:05:03,503
Forty cents...

52
00:05:05,870 --> 00:05:07,406
Two dollars and
forty-two cents...

53
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:10,442
I'm hungry.

54
00:05:10,475 --> 00:05:12,411
Shut it, Coke.
We don't got enough yet.

55
00:05:16,648 --> 00:05:18,751
Do you think I'll look
like Mom when I grow up?

56
00:05:19,785 --> 00:05:21,520
Sure. Of course.

57
00:05:21,552 --> 00:05:23,822
I think I'm starting to
forget Momma now.

58
00:05:23,855 --> 00:05:25,824
Coke, she's only been gone
a couple of years.

59
00:05:33,432 --> 00:05:34,800
-Him?
-Yeah, go.

60
00:05:34,833 --> 00:05:38,504
Hey, this, sir, is for
the Red Cross.

61
00:05:43,875 --> 00:05:44,943
Dick.

62
00:05:45,711 --> 00:05:46,846
What's it say?

63
00:05:48,547 --> 00:05:51,016
"Are you good with kids?"

64
00:05:51,048 --> 00:05:52,517
What do you think?

65
00:05:52,550 --> 00:05:53,819
I'm not a kid.

66
00:05:55,853 --> 00:05:58,490
I'll be back. -Where do
you think you're going?

67
00:05:58,524 --> 00:05:59,891
Get on the rocks, Coke,
and what?

68
00:05:59,925 --> 00:06:01,394
-Chill.
-Exactly.

69
00:06:02,461 --> 00:06:03,429
I'll be back.

70
00:06:34,759 --> 00:06:35,560
Thanks, babe.

71
00:06:41,899 --> 00:06:46,204
What is this, the third or fourth
family she's pulled you away from?

72
00:06:46,237 --> 00:06:48,206
And impersonating the
Red Cross is a felony.

73
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:50,576
Did she tell you that? You want
to end up like your sister?

74
00:06:50,608 --> 00:06:52,076
Where is she?

75
00:06:52,110 --> 00:06:53,545
Jack!

76
00:07:10,963 --> 00:07:11,764
No.

77
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:13,665
Coke.

78
00:07:22,673 --> 00:07:23,675
Hey!

79
00:07:26,211 --> 00:07:28,448
Hey, Max! Sit!

80
00:07:29,514 --> 00:07:31,015
Sit, sit.

81
00:07:31,048 --> 00:07:32,116
Sit!

82
00:07:32,149 --> 00:07:33,685
Lay down.

83
00:07:33,718 --> 00:07:35,721
Lay down. Good boy.

84
00:07:35,754 --> 00:07:37,689
Yeah, good boy.

85
00:07:37,723 --> 00:07:40,725
Man.
Yo, what up, girl?

86
00:07:40,759 --> 00:07:43,829
-Hey, Dais.
-Where have you been?

87
00:07:43,862 --> 00:07:45,965
You been hiding somewhere?
Where you been staying?

88
00:07:45,997 --> 00:07:49,032
Nowhere good. Squatting some
with Jeremy and those kids.

89
00:07:49,033 --> 00:07:50,502
All right.

90
00:07:50,536 --> 00:07:52,137
Yo, wait.
He ain't allowed inside.

91
00:07:52,170 --> 00:07:54,507
Relax, Dais, neither am I.

92
00:07:54,540 --> 00:07:56,141
Let's go.

93
00:07:56,173 --> 00:07:58,610
So where's Coke at?
I thought you got her again.

94
00:08:00,045 --> 00:08:01,780
Shit. I did.

95
00:08:01,812 --> 00:08:03,781
But then my damn
probation officer...

96
00:08:03,814 --> 00:08:05,084
She... She don't quit.

97
00:08:07,119 --> 00:08:10,055
Man, poor kid must
have been terrified.

98
00:08:10,088 --> 00:08:13,959
Shit, if they place her, they gonna
put her somewhere you can't find her.

99
00:08:13,992 --> 00:08:15,294
Who's the girl with
the funky teeth?

100
00:08:15,326 --> 00:08:17,696
Got to be her little brother's
guardian, you know?

101
00:08:17,728 --> 00:08:19,231
Yo, I don't remember.
Tania. Tany...

102
00:08:20,966 --> 00:08:22,634
Yo, but it ain't enough
to be 18.

103
00:08:22,668 --> 00:08:25,638
You got to have a real job.
A real place to live, man.

104
00:08:25,670 --> 00:08:27,939
Well, that's what this is, see.
"Room and board."

105
00:08:33,845 --> 00:08:34,812
Shit.

106
00:08:34,846 --> 00:08:37,883
You still know that guy
on staff at Hollygrove?

107
00:08:37,916 --> 00:08:39,951
You ain't bustin' her
out of that place!

108
00:08:39,985 --> 00:08:42,754
No, just to call her
and talk to her.

109
00:08:42,788 --> 00:08:44,222
Just give them a call,
see if she's there.

110
00:08:47,960 --> 00:08:50,696
I suppose you want me
to check on this too.

111
00:08:50,729 --> 00:08:53,266
Yeah. Set me up good,
like we used to.

112
00:08:56,168 --> 00:08:57,036
All right.

113
00:08:58,269 --> 00:08:59,672
I'll call her...

114
00:09:03,741 --> 00:09:05,810
If you do something for me.

115
00:09:15,019 --> 00:09:16,922
<i>Hello?</i>

116
00:09:16,955 --> 00:09:18,657
<i>Hi, I'm calling from
an employment agency.</i>

117
00:09:18,690 --> 00:09:20,993
<i>I saw your flier.</i>

118
00:09:21,025 --> 00:09:23,828
Thanks for calling
but, you know,

119
00:09:23,861 --> 00:09:26,966
I think I found someone
actually already. So...

120
00:09:26,999 --> 00:09:30,168
<i>Yeah? Okay. But maybe just in case
I could get your information.</i>

121
00:09:30,201 --> 00:09:32,705
<i>I mean, you never know.</i>

122
00:09:32,738 --> 00:09:34,173
<i>Well, she's
coming at four today,</i>

123
00:09:34,206 --> 00:09:36,642
<i>so there's really no point,
but, all right.</i>

124
00:09:40,979 --> 00:09:42,648
<i>Yeah, cool.
What's the play?</i>

125
00:09:42,681 --> 00:09:44,682
<i>Okay, so her name
is Kay Adams.</i>

126
00:09:44,716 --> 00:09:46,686
<i>She gonna interview
another girl at four, okay?</i>

127
00:09:48,419 --> 00:09:52,123
<i>You get there first,
head her off, take it over.</i>

128
00:09:52,157 --> 00:09:55,860
<i>Yeah, but you got to be super
legit, okay? Like seriously.</i>

129
00:09:55,894 --> 00:09:58,096
<i>Yeah, yeah, yeah.</i>

130
00:09:58,129 --> 00:10:00,966
<i>You mean, like, when I played that
door-to-door Bible selling gal.</i>

131
00:10:03,067 --> 00:10:05,803
<i>No, no, no. No, no.
Like that art therapy chica.</i>

132
00:10:05,836 --> 00:10:07,438
<i>You know,
the one from Hollygrove.</i>

133
00:10:07,471 --> 00:10:11,043
<i>Yeah, yeah. Or "Paint the
feelings behind the feelings."</i>

134
00:10:13,678 --> 00:10:17,015
Donna,
have you had problems

135
00:10:17,048 --> 00:10:18,983
with your voice
messages before?

136
00:10:19,017 --> 00:10:21,153
I didn't get a message.
I'm sorry.

137
00:10:21,186 --> 00:10:23,122
No, no, no. I'm sorry.

138
00:10:23,154 --> 00:10:25,757
We really wanted
to save you the trip out here.

139
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:37,269
Honey?

140
00:10:37,302 --> 00:10:38,236
Honey, I can't...

141
00:10:40,004 --> 00:10:42,240
Mark, is she hungry?

142
00:10:42,274 --> 00:10:43,676
<i>Come on, let's go.</i>

143
00:10:43,708 --> 00:10:45,710
Does she need tinkle?

144
00:10:45,744 --> 00:10:46,945
I think there was a
little bit of a mix-up.

145
00:10:46,977 --> 00:10:50,048
You see, her husband
already hired someone.

146
00:10:50,081 --> 00:10:52,717
But you know what, we are definitely
gonna hang on to your resume

147
00:10:52,750 --> 00:10:53,584
in case
she doesn't work out.

148
00:10:53,619 --> 00:10:55,721
Why am I even cleaning
this mess up?

149
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:58,190
This woman should know what
she's getting herself into.

150
00:10:58,222 --> 00:11:01,225
Okay, who are you again?

151
00:11:01,259 --> 00:11:02,794
I'm... I'm Kay's cousin.

152
00:11:10,302 --> 00:11:12,738
-Donna? Hi.
-Yeah. That's me.

153
00:11:13,739 --> 00:11:14,973
Is everything okay?

154
00:11:15,005 --> 00:11:17,141
Yeah. That was just my ride.

155
00:11:17,174 --> 00:11:19,077
I... I forgot my resume in
the car, but I have it.

156
00:11:19,110 --> 00:11:20,211
Great. Come on in.

157
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:27,786
Please, sit down.

158
00:11:30,489 --> 00:11:32,257
So can I get you some water?

159
00:11:32,289 --> 00:11:33,858
Tea? Shot of whiskey?

160
00:11:35,427 --> 00:11:36,528
Just kidding.

161
00:11:36,562 --> 00:11:38,764
You said you'd worked
with autistic children before?

162
00:11:41,265 --> 00:11:44,102
Yeah, here.

163
00:11:44,135 --> 00:11:46,370
Is that the same as
what you emailed me, yeah?

164
00:11:46,403 --> 00:11:48,340
Yep. Well, you know
what they say,

165
00:11:48,373 --> 00:11:50,209
you can never be
too prepared.

166
00:11:51,176 --> 00:11:52,778
You're my kind of person.

167
00:11:52,811 --> 00:11:53,879
Okay.

168
00:11:55,514 --> 00:11:57,983
Come on.

169
00:11:58,015 --> 00:11:59,283
Three years at
the same daycare,

170
00:11:59,317 --> 00:12:01,419
and your supervisor spoke
very highly of you.

171
00:12:01,452 --> 00:12:04,088
I checked your references.
Very complimentary.

172
00:12:04,121 --> 00:12:05,990
So, sit down.

173
00:12:07,793 --> 00:12:10,328
-Tell me about yourself.
-Tell me about you!

174
00:12:10,361 --> 00:12:15,867
When did you first find out that
Glory was, differently abled?

175
00:12:15,900 --> 00:12:19,270
Please, no need to be politically
correct around here.

176
00:12:19,303 --> 00:12:21,774
If she were "differently
abled" I'd be thrilled.

177
00:12:21,807 --> 00:12:23,509
She was four.

178
00:12:25,910 --> 00:12:27,979
That must've been
very hard for you.

179
00:12:28,013 --> 00:12:30,415
Just felt like my heart was ripped out
of my chest and served on a cracker.

180
00:12:30,447 --> 00:12:33,117
Other than that, it was fine.

181
00:12:33,150 --> 00:12:36,020
Now, as for you, you worked with
autistic kids at the daycare?

182
00:12:36,053 --> 00:12:37,389
Yes. Absolutely.

183
00:12:37,422 --> 00:12:40,359
And are you more into
ABA or Greenspan?

184
00:12:46,063 --> 00:12:47,899
Basically, I... I don't care
what you call it.

185
00:12:47,932 --> 00:12:50,302
It's, whatever works
for each child.

186
00:12:51,469 --> 00:12:53,205
That's good. I like that.

187
00:12:53,238 --> 00:12:56,041
And, tell me
about Rebecca.

188
00:12:57,042 --> 00:12:58,811
Rebecca?

189
00:12:58,844 --> 00:13:00,846
Your supervisor said
you had a very special bond

190
00:13:00,879 --> 00:13:02,548
with a little girl
named Rebecca.

191
00:13:02,581 --> 00:13:06,851
Right, Rebecca.
Sweet precious Becky.

192
00:13:08,186 --> 00:13:09,955
Ms. Appleby said
she was a terror.

193
00:13:12,123 --> 00:13:14,225
Not to me she wasn't.

194
00:13:14,259 --> 00:13:16,361
Okay.

195
00:13:19,530 --> 00:13:21,432
That'll be Glory.
Come on.

196
00:13:26,937 --> 00:13:28,006
No!

197
00:13:31,275 --> 00:13:32,977
-Slow down! Slow...
-Glory.

198
00:13:33,010 --> 00:13:35,112
She's been in a tantrum
the entire drive home.

199
00:13:35,145 --> 00:13:38,015
Honey, honey, Mark.
This is Donna.

200
00:13:39,884 --> 00:13:42,120
-Hi, Mr. Adams.
-Hey.

201
00:13:42,153 --> 00:13:42,762
Sorry...

202
00:13:42,763 --> 00:13:44,590
Do you want to go meet
our little baby girl?

203
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:46,091
Come on.

204
00:13:47,057 --> 00:13:48,326
Just as I thought.

205
00:13:49,628 --> 00:13:51,564
Sweetie.

206
00:13:59,070 --> 00:14:00,439
Can you say, "Hi, Donna"?

207
00:14:03,274 --> 00:14:04,509
<i>Such a pretty girl.</i>

208
00:14:06,110 --> 00:14:07,446
<i>Say "Hi, Donna."</i>

209
00:14:10,282 --> 00:14:13,051
Bye, Donna.

210
00:14:13,083 --> 00:14:15,119
She meant to say hi.
Trust me.

211
00:14:20,591 --> 00:14:23,361
She doesn't talk much?

212
00:14:23,394 --> 00:14:25,297
She can talk spontaneously

213
00:14:25,330 --> 00:14:27,199
when she wants
to eat something, but...

214
00:14:31,336 --> 00:14:33,572
So is she like good at
math or something?

215
00:14:33,605 --> 00:14:38,310
<i>Glory's no Rain Man.
No genius savant upside.</i>

216
00:14:38,342 --> 00:14:39,978
But we like to think she has
an exceptional personality.

217
00:14:43,548 --> 00:14:44,950
What you got there?

218
00:14:46,051 --> 00:14:46,919
So, what d'you think?

219
00:14:48,352 --> 00:14:49,420
Easy peasy, right?

220
00:14:50,054 --> 00:14:51,089
Yeah.

221
00:14:54,392 --> 00:14:55,326
So I start work on Monday.

222
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,296
And I wanna get Glory
used to you right away.

223
00:14:57,328 --> 00:14:59,463
So, just to double-check,

224
00:14:59,496 --> 00:15:01,599
you're available immediately,
tomorrow?

225
00:15:01,633 --> 00:15:05,103
That'll give me a few days to
show you "all things Glory."

226
00:15:05,135 --> 00:15:06,570
Will you do it?

227
00:15:06,604 --> 00:15:11,276
She's adorable,
and you both seem great.

228
00:15:11,308 --> 00:15:14,078
But, I really can't take
a pay cut right now...

229
00:15:14,111 --> 00:15:15,579
Twenty dollars an hour.

230
00:15:15,613 --> 00:15:17,449
Yeah, maybe we can
talk about this.

231
00:15:17,481 --> 00:15:19,951
There's nothing more
we can do.

232
00:15:19,985 --> 00:15:21,320
Yeah. -We really need
the help right now.

233
00:15:25,056 --> 00:15:27,026
Well, you know,
I'll make it work.

234
00:15:28,158 --> 00:15:30,227
Great!

235
00:15:30,260 --> 00:15:33,231
Okay, so, 8:00?

236
00:15:33,697 --> 00:15:36,100
Okay.

237
00:15:36,134 --> 00:15:39,037
-Sure. Tomorrow.
-Yeah. Tomorrow. Bye, Donna.

238
00:15:39,070 --> 00:15:44,076
Honey, I finally get
to go back to work.

239
00:15:44,109 --> 00:15:47,211
I really, really wish you had
talked to me first.

240
00:15:47,245 --> 00:15:49,248
Honey, don't be a downer.

241
00:15:50,315 --> 00:15:52,350
Okay, everybody
raves about her.

242
00:16:25,082 --> 00:16:25,985
Hey.

243
00:16:27,251 --> 00:16:28,286
Hey.

244
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,400
What are you dressed up
like that for?

245
00:16:41,432 --> 00:16:44,168
Hey, I know you're not
really mad at me,

246
00:16:44,201 --> 00:16:45,669
you're just trying
to punish me.

247
00:16:45,702 --> 00:16:47,238
I am mad at you.

248
00:16:47,272 --> 00:16:49,041
But I'm 18 now.

249
00:16:49,073 --> 00:16:51,609
If they get me
it won't be juvie anymore.

250
00:16:51,643 --> 00:16:54,178
It'd be real jail with
really bad people.

251
00:16:54,211 --> 00:16:55,447
But you are a bad person.

252
00:16:55,480 --> 00:16:57,416
Come on, Coke.
Don't say that.

253
00:16:57,448 --> 00:16:59,517
I'm doing my best.

254
00:16:59,551 --> 00:17:01,552
And no one's supposed to
call me Coke anymore.

255
00:17:01,586 --> 00:17:02,821
What?

256
00:17:02,854 --> 00:17:06,091
Jack and Coke is
"not appropriate."

257
00:17:06,124 --> 00:17:08,093
Who said that?
Elizabeth say that?

258
00:17:10,761 --> 00:17:13,298
Jack and Coke goes
with good times.

259
00:17:13,330 --> 00:17:15,634
That's you and me, right?
Good times!

260
00:17:15,666 --> 00:17:18,135
Excuse me? Hey?

261
00:17:18,169 --> 00:17:20,739
Okay. I got a job.
I'm getting us a place.

262
00:17:20,771 --> 00:17:22,173
Just don't buy
into the bullshit.

263
00:17:24,241 --> 00:17:27,412
Okay. ABA.

264
00:17:27,444 --> 00:17:33,818
Applied Behavior,
Behavioral Analysis Therapy.

265
00:17:33,852 --> 00:17:37,189
It's like, giving treats
as rewards and shit.

266
00:17:37,221 --> 00:17:39,191
Yep. You're a pro.

267
00:17:40,325 --> 00:17:42,527
"Stimming?"

268
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:45,830
Yeah. It's like doing something over
and over again, to stimulate yourself.

269
00:17:45,864 --> 00:17:47,399
Girl, I do that
all the time.

270
00:17:47,432 --> 00:17:49,434
You do it too!

271
00:17:50,434 --> 00:17:52,437
Okay, so how's the dad like?

272
00:17:53,337 --> 00:17:54,638
I got it.

273
00:17:54,672 --> 00:17:55,673
And the mom?

274
00:17:57,642 --> 00:17:59,577
That bitch is wack.

275
00:17:59,611 --> 00:18:00,812
Shit.

276
00:18:00,845 --> 00:18:02,346
Man, I got no choice.
I gotta stick it out.

277
00:18:04,615 --> 00:18:06,617
-Okay.
-How's this look?

278
00:18:16,594 --> 00:18:17,528
Hello?

279
00:18:23,601 --> 00:18:24,403
Didn't tell you they had
a son, did they?

280
00:18:26,336 --> 00:18:28,405
Don't be silly.

281
00:18:28,439 --> 00:18:30,542
Welcome, Donna. This is
our son, Robert. -Thanks.

282
00:18:30,575 --> 00:18:31,844
Robert, be nice.

283
00:18:33,678 --> 00:18:37,382
So, It's not Bob.
Not Robbie.

284
00:18:37,414 --> 00:18:38,549
Just Robert, okay.

285
00:18:39,217 --> 00:18:40,319
Okay.

286
00:18:42,452 --> 00:18:45,289
You gonna let me in, Robert?

287
00:18:45,323 --> 00:18:46,391
Are you here to save the day?

288
00:18:47,424 --> 00:18:48,493
Wah-wah!

289
00:18:48,893 --> 00:18:50,729
Wah-wah!

290
00:18:50,761 --> 00:18:52,897
Donna?
Donna, in here.

291
00:18:55,833 --> 00:18:58,202
This is your cell phone.

292
00:18:58,236 --> 00:18:59,838
All our numbers
are already... See?

293
00:18:59,871 --> 00:19:02,274
-Just so you know.
-Thank you.

294
00:19:02,307 --> 00:19:04,576
And, as for computer, you can
use the one in the kitchen.

295
00:19:04,608 --> 00:19:06,443
So what d'you say,
we start in 10 minutes?

296
00:19:06,477 --> 00:19:08,413
Sure, yeah. That's great.

297
00:19:17,989 --> 00:19:19,790
In here.

298
00:19:19,824 --> 00:19:20,892
Hi, Glory.

299
00:19:20,924 --> 00:19:22,594
Look who's here, Glory.

300
00:19:22,626 --> 00:19:24,596
Can you say
"Hi, Donna"?

301
00:19:24,628 --> 00:19:26,230
Hi, Donna.

302
00:19:26,263 --> 00:19:29,600
Progress.
You got a "hi."

303
00:19:29,634 --> 00:19:31,903
All right, let's start
in the kitchen. -Okay.

304
00:19:31,935 --> 00:19:33,672
She aspires to the empyrean.

305
00:19:37,575 --> 00:19:39,711
Her supplements.

306
00:19:39,743 --> 00:19:41,846
The digestive enzymes
are especially important...

307
00:19:41,878 --> 00:19:43,948
They create the most
potent effluvium.

308
00:19:43,981 --> 00:19:46,350
Robert, you'll be late
for school. Out, out, out.

309
00:19:48,452 --> 00:19:52,290
So, she takes
all of these in one day?

310
00:19:53,657 --> 00:19:55,660
Dude. Dude.

311
00:19:56,394 --> 00:19:57,528
Dude.

312
00:19:59,830 --> 00:20:01,432
You're not gonna
guess this.

313
00:20:01,465 --> 00:20:03,667
My sister's new
babysitter is hot.

314
00:20:03,701 --> 00:20:05,537
-Hell no.
-Unequivocally, man.

315
00:20:05,569 --> 00:20:06,971
I'm not even kidding.
She's...

316
00:20:07,005 --> 00:20:10,642
She's a blazing beauty. Like, she's...
I open the door...

317
00:20:10,674 --> 00:20:12,543
Her eyes were so captivating.

318
00:20:12,576 --> 00:20:14,913
How hot are we talking,
like a solid nine, ten piece?

319
00:20:14,945 --> 00:20:16,880
No, dog, I'm talking
12, 15...

320
00:20:16,913 --> 00:20:19,250
Twelve, 15?
I'm talking 12, 15.

321
00:20:19,284 --> 00:20:21,519
And, dog, she just graduated
college so she's like,

322
00:20:21,551 --> 00:20:23,754
-25, 26? I don't know.
-What, 26?

323
00:20:23,788 --> 00:20:25,257
She's a woman, dog.
She's not a girl.

324
00:20:25,289 --> 00:20:27,259
-You gotta go for it.
-I plan to, man.

325
00:20:27,291 --> 00:20:28,459
Dude, you got
to hook me up with that.

326
00:20:28,492 --> 00:20:30,528
I... I have the car.

327
00:20:30,560 --> 00:20:32,630
First. I've managed to
get Glory an interview

328
00:20:32,663 --> 00:20:34,932
with this amazing new school.

329
00:20:34,965 --> 00:20:37,968
It's a... It's a long shot
because frankly, well...

330
00:20:38,001 --> 00:20:40,371
But her public school doesn't
challenge her enough.

331
00:20:40,404 --> 00:20:41,572
Or, at all.

332
00:20:43,540 --> 00:20:44,675
So the interview's in a month.

333
00:20:44,709 --> 00:20:46,378
Well, a little more
than a month.

334
00:20:46,411 --> 00:20:47,812
Does that sound like
a good short-term goal?

335
00:20:47,845 --> 00:20:49,648
-Yeah.
-Ta-da.

336
00:20:49,681 --> 00:20:51,716
<i>This is your Bible.</i>

337
00:20:51,749 --> 00:20:53,852
I tried to write everything
down but it's impossible.

338
00:20:53,884 --> 00:20:56,855
You're just gonna have to pay
attention and follow me around.

339
00:20:56,887 --> 00:20:58,622
You're gonna keep a record
of everything in this book.

340
00:20:58,655 --> 00:21:01,893
Diet. Very important.

341
00:21:01,925 --> 00:21:04,462
Casein-free, gluten free.

342
00:21:05,863 --> 00:21:08,365
We've...
We've had some issues.

343
00:21:08,398 --> 00:21:10,692
Let's just say, if
your kid goes for almost

344
00:21:10,693 --> 00:21:12,569
two weeks without
a bowel movement,

345
00:21:12,603 --> 00:21:14,939
it's time to go to the
for a poop extraction.

346
00:21:14,971 --> 00:21:16,540
Good times.

347
00:21:17,808 --> 00:21:18,609
Let's get her in the car.

348
00:21:29,953 --> 00:21:32,790
-Hi. This is... This is Donna.
-Hi.

349
00:21:32,824 --> 00:21:33,925
Hi, Donna.
Nice to meet you.

350
00:21:33,958 --> 00:21:34,926
Nice to meet you.

351
00:21:37,394 --> 00:21:38,529
You got this.

352
00:21:40,064 --> 00:21:41,466
You know what to do.

353
00:21:42,866 --> 00:21:44,702
Go ahead.

354
00:21:44,736 --> 00:21:47,439
Glory's logbook. Right...

355
00:21:47,471 --> 00:21:49,507
-Here. I forgot...
-Over here is fine.

356
00:21:49,539 --> 00:21:51,009
-Yeah.
-And that's Glory's...

357
00:21:51,041 --> 00:21:53,077
Actually, I've got this.

358
00:21:53,111 --> 00:21:55,414
Come on, Glory.
Let's go.

359
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:06,024
Well, I never thought I'd, have
to repeat the fourth grade again.

360
00:22:06,057 --> 00:22:07,592
I bet...

361
00:22:08,826 --> 00:22:11,363
So how's this, work?

362
00:22:11,395 --> 00:22:13,731
The first rule is we're not
here to talk to each other.

363
00:22:18,970 --> 00:22:21,005
Okay, so under
the "Chauffeur" tab,

364
00:22:21,038 --> 00:22:22,740
you'll see how to catch a ride
from school to therapy

365
00:22:22,773 --> 00:22:24,675
with Parent Transit.

366
00:22:24,709 --> 00:22:25,811
I've scheduled it for every
Tuesday and Friday.

367
00:22:32,750 --> 00:22:34,018
Hi.

368
00:22:34,050 --> 00:22:36,019
-This is Donna.
-Hi.

369
00:22:36,053 --> 00:22:37,456
Pam is speech and
language therapist.

370
00:22:41,759 --> 00:22:44,496
Hey. This is Donna.

371
00:22:44,528 --> 00:22:46,131
Matt. Occupational therapist.

372
00:22:49,133 --> 00:22:51,436
That kid has to wear
those all the time.

373
00:22:51,469 --> 00:22:53,671
He can hear water running
through the pipes.

374
00:22:53,703 --> 00:22:55,440
Lot of these kids
have sensory issues.

375
00:22:55,472 --> 00:22:57,575
Autism pretty much sucks.

376
00:22:57,607 --> 00:22:59,443
Am I talking too much?

377
00:22:59,477 --> 00:23:02,046
I haven't had anyone to talk
to in years. This is fun.

378
00:23:02,078 --> 00:23:03,681
Kay! Hey, How are you?

379
00:23:03,713 --> 00:23:05,149
Elaine, hi!

380
00:23:05,182 --> 00:23:06,483
Hi, Glory!

381
00:23:06,517 --> 00:23:08,620
We should go through this.

382
00:23:08,653 --> 00:23:10,521
Glory, what do you say?

383
00:23:10,988 --> 00:23:13,158
Hi, Donna.

384
00:23:13,191 --> 00:23:15,460
This is Donna,
Glory's new companion.

385
00:23:15,492 --> 00:23:17,162
Glory, you get a new friend.

386
00:23:17,194 --> 00:23:19,029
So, how's Danny?
How's... How's everything?

387
00:23:19,063 --> 00:23:20,999
He's great.
We mainstreamed him last year.

388
00:23:21,031 --> 00:23:22,800
Although he's still brushing up
on some articulation with Pam...

389
00:23:22,834 --> 00:23:24,936
He's...
He's totally recovered?

390
00:23:24,969 --> 00:23:26,638
Well...

391
00:23:26,671 --> 00:23:28,706
He'll be furious if I'm not
here to pick him up on time,

392
00:23:28,739 --> 00:23:31,076
but that's most kids for ya.
Gotta run.

393
00:23:39,483 --> 00:23:41,586
Recovered? Recovered?

394
00:23:41,618 --> 00:23:42,920
I mean, I'm happy
for them, I am.

395
00:23:42,953 --> 00:23:45,123
But they did nothing
and he's better.

396
00:23:45,155 --> 00:23:47,491
And we tried
everything, and...

397
00:23:52,896 --> 00:23:54,432
I love you, girlie.

398
00:23:55,665 --> 00:23:57,067
I'd kill for you.

399
00:24:02,105 --> 00:24:03,474
Glory?

400
00:24:06,210 --> 00:24:07,711
Elphan.

401
00:24:07,744 --> 00:24:08,946
Say it better.

402
00:24:12,782 --> 00:24:15,586
-Elephant.
-Good job, girlie.

403
00:24:15,619 --> 00:24:16,553
What's your favorite?

404
00:24:16,586 --> 00:24:17,588
Red one.

405
00:24:18,955 --> 00:24:20,557
Jelly bean! Jelly bean!
Jelly bean!

406
00:24:21,759 --> 00:24:23,161
Okay, one more.

407
00:24:24,828 --> 00:24:28,232
She can do it
when she's motivated.

408
00:24:28,266 --> 00:24:30,092
And don't overdo it
with the jelly beans.

409
00:24:30,093 --> 00:24:30,701
Okay.

410
00:24:30,734 --> 00:24:31,569
Just enough
to keep her attention.

411
00:24:33,570 --> 00:24:35,673
Thanks to the ABA we can
get her attention at all.

412
00:24:36,807 --> 00:24:38,809
Yeah.

413
00:24:38,843 --> 00:24:41,846
And it's thanks to the ABA
that we are so in debt.

414
00:24:43,881 --> 00:24:46,684
One hundred and fifty
thousand dollars.

415
00:24:46,717 --> 00:24:49,120
-My gosh.
-Youch.

416
00:24:49,153 --> 00:24:51,823
Thanks. That's...

417
00:24:51,855 --> 00:24:55,058
Try the red ones.
Glory's favorite.

418
00:24:55,092 --> 00:24:57,195
-Mine too. It's really good.
-Good.

419
00:25:00,631 --> 00:25:01,500
Let's wait for Mark.

420
00:25:02,732 --> 00:25:03,967
Okay. I'm sorry.

421
00:25:04,999 --> 00:25:05,636
-There you are.
-Hey.

422
00:25:06,604 --> 00:25:08,273
Just in time to say grace.

423
00:25:08,306 --> 00:25:11,610
Excellent. Just dressing up
for Sunday dinner. Thank you.

424
00:25:16,012 --> 00:25:18,015
I want tat-o's please.

425
00:25:18,048 --> 00:25:21,786
Thank you, dear Lord, for the
food we are about to eat.

426
00:25:21,818 --> 00:25:23,555
For the hands
that prepared it.

427
00:25:23,587 --> 00:25:25,889
-I want tat-o's please.
-Thank you for...

428
00:25:25,923 --> 00:25:28,159
For Donna,

429
00:25:28,192 --> 00:25:31,162
the lovely woman who is about
to be Glory's companion.

430
00:25:31,194 --> 00:25:32,797
-Thank you for our health...
-I want tat-o's please.

431
00:25:32,829 --> 00:25:35,899
...and Glory's continued
development. Amen.

432
00:25:35,932 --> 00:25:38,970
And for Robert and his
good friend Dudley.

433
00:25:39,002 --> 00:25:40,237
And for my job.

434
00:25:40,270 --> 00:25:42,673
We thank you. Amen.

435
00:25:42,707 --> 00:25:46,611
Amen. -So how are things
in your life, boys?

436
00:25:46,644 --> 00:25:49,247
Everybody's raving about how
great State's gonna be.

437
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:50,115
It'll be fine, honey.

438
00:25:51,882 --> 00:25:53,585
-Glory, no.
-Wonderful.

439
00:25:53,617 --> 00:25:54,586
It'll be swank.

440
00:25:55,685 --> 00:25:57,355
It'll be cool.
We got my car.

441
00:25:57,387 --> 00:25:59,323
Your car?
He's not driving your car.

442
00:26:00,758 --> 00:26:03,260
-I want 'tat-o's please.
-Glory!

443
00:26:05,328 --> 00:26:07,331
I want my 'tat-o's.

444
00:26:07,365 --> 00:26:09,934
Donna, the whole point is for her
to talk. Not punish her for it.

445
00:26:17,008 --> 00:26:18,242
Donna.

446
00:26:20,344 --> 00:26:21,746
Mark, could you...

447
00:26:21,778 --> 00:26:23,847
Come here, sweetie.
It's all right.

448
00:26:23,881 --> 00:26:27,085
Glory, sweetie.
It's okay.

449
00:26:27,117 --> 00:26:28,653
She's accustomed to taking
things of our plates.

450
00:26:28,685 --> 00:26:30,588
It's the only time we can
have any adult conversation.

451
00:26:32,355 --> 00:26:33,791
What a total con.

452
00:26:34,959 --> 00:26:36,061
Exactly.

453
00:26:38,194 --> 00:26:40,230
I mean...

454
00:26:40,263 --> 00:26:43,067
Your compliance only reinforces
her manipulation, Kay.

455
00:26:43,099 --> 00:26:43,901
That... That's all.

456
00:26:45,869 --> 00:26:49,673
This is exactly what
I've been saying for years.

457
00:26:49,707 --> 00:26:51,909
Now suddenly everyone's an
expert when I'm the one who's...

458
00:26:51,942 --> 00:26:53,979
No. I mean, she has a point,
does she not?

459
00:26:58,449 --> 00:27:00,018
Go on, sweetie.
Let's go to the kitchen.

460
00:27:02,452 --> 00:27:03,355
We're having dinner.
I don't understand.

461
00:27:06,190 --> 00:27:07,292
Nice work, Dad.

462
00:27:09,192 --> 00:27:10,228
Excuse me?

463
00:27:12,096 --> 00:27:13,330
I was agreeing with you.

464
00:27:13,364 --> 00:27:14,365
No, you were agreeing
with her.

465
00:27:20,171 --> 00:27:21,773
I'm sorry, Donna.

466
00:27:21,806 --> 00:27:22,973
It's okay. I'll eat
in the living room.

467
00:27:24,174 --> 00:27:25,276
Thank you.

468
00:27:27,044 --> 00:27:30,348
We can do everything the same.
Just with Donna, okay?

469
00:27:31,949 --> 00:27:35,119
She's been friends with
other girls like you.

470
00:27:35,152 --> 00:27:37,188
And Mommy will be
home by six, so...

471
00:27:39,323 --> 00:27:42,994
Everything's gonna be fine.

472
00:27:43,027 --> 00:27:46,064
I mean, you got to give them a taste
of their own medicine, right?

473
00:27:46,096 --> 00:27:47,865
Maybe you should study
the natives a little while

474
00:27:47,897 --> 00:27:49,400
before you try
and evangelize them.

475
00:27:51,134 --> 00:27:52,302
Does he always talk like that?

476
00:27:52,336 --> 00:27:55,339
Yeah. I don't though.
You know, I'm chill.

477
00:27:57,741 --> 00:28:00,243
So, Donna,
tell us about yourself.

478
00:28:00,277 --> 00:28:02,913
You go to college?

479
00:28:02,946 --> 00:28:04,915
Yeah. Where did you,
where did you go to college?

480
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:06,384
Yeah.
It must have been fun.

481
00:28:06,416 --> 00:28:08,086
What did you study?

482
00:28:08,118 --> 00:28:09,853
Like, can you
buy alcohol?

483
00:28:09,886 --> 00:28:11,722
Dude, shut up! -Do you
have friends in the area?

484
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:13,324
I'm gonna go eat with your dad.
Where do you party?

485
00:28:13,356 --> 00:28:16,461
I have a Cadillac if you wanna
go for a ride in it some time.

486
00:28:16,493 --> 00:28:18,895
Wait.
Where... Damn.

487
00:28:18,929 --> 00:28:21,966
Dude, yo, bro,
I swear if you don't, I will.

488
00:28:36,279 --> 00:28:38,115
Your mom just, I don't know...

489
00:28:39,383 --> 00:28:41,752
I thought maybe if you...

490
00:28:41,786 --> 00:28:42,887
I mean, you wanna
talk or something?

491
00:28:42,920 --> 00:28:43,955
No. I don't.

492
00:28:44,922 --> 00:28:46,391
Look, Robert...

493
00:28:47,290 --> 00:28:48,759
Dad, I'm busy right now.

494
00:28:52,930 --> 00:28:53,798
You need something?

495
00:28:55,499 --> 00:28:57,067
No.

496
00:28:57,101 --> 00:28:58,169
All right, then.

497
00:29:06,943 --> 00:29:08,312
I'll be upstairs
if you need me.

498
00:29:21,357 --> 00:29:23,394
One of the moms at
Sing-and-Swing recommended her.

499
00:29:23,426 --> 00:29:25,462
And how old is she?

500
00:29:25,496 --> 00:29:27,031
I don't know. Graduated
college a couple years ago.

501
00:29:27,064 --> 00:29:28,365
Early twenties?

502
00:29:28,398 --> 00:29:29,967
-Where did she graduate?
-Community college.

503
00:29:31,868 --> 00:29:33,437
What's with
the gazillion questions?

504
00:29:34,171 --> 00:29:36,240
We need her.

505
00:29:36,272 --> 00:29:38,342
-Eat your breakfast before...
-I already ate.

506
00:29:42,078 --> 00:29:43,380
Dudley's gonna
be here in five.

507
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:48,185
What? No.

508
00:29:50,354 --> 00:29:50,955
Donna?

509
00:29:53,123 --> 00:29:55,459
Donna?

510
00:29:55,491 --> 00:29:57,127
Door's locked.

511
00:29:57,161 --> 00:29:57,996
Are you up?

512
00:30:00,597 --> 00:30:01,532
Donna?

513
00:30:05,236 --> 00:30:06,103
Hi...

514
00:30:06,135 --> 00:30:07,872
Not ready?

515
00:30:07,904 --> 00:30:10,907
I have allergies...

516
00:30:10,941 --> 00:30:13,044
First day, remember, under
the "Weekly Schedule" tab.

517
00:30:13,076 --> 00:30:14,846
You take full charge of Glory

518
00:30:14,878 --> 00:30:16,480
about 30 minutes
before I go to work...

519
00:30:19,450 --> 00:30:21,318
Put clothes on. Chop-chop.

520
00:30:21,352 --> 00:30:23,855
Honey, honey. Relax, okay.
Everything's gonna be fine.

521
00:30:23,887 --> 00:30:26,057
This is not the impression I wanna
make on my first day at work.

522
00:30:26,089 --> 00:30:28,024
I understand that, but you're gonna
be fine. Glory's gonna be fine.

523
00:30:28,057 --> 00:30:30,961
Everybody... -Nothing is
fine unless I make it fine.

524
00:30:30,994 --> 00:30:32,562
Hey.

525
00:30:32,596 --> 00:30:35,400
-No, can you just... God.
-Okay, okay, okay...

526
00:30:41,137 --> 00:30:42,941
Peace be among everybody.

527
00:30:47,944 --> 00:30:50,114
Mommy loves you, okay?

528
00:30:50,146 --> 00:30:53,183
Eyes. Eyes. Mommy's eyes.

529
00:30:56,220 --> 00:30:57,989
You be good.

530
00:30:58,021 --> 00:31:01,192
-Be good.
-Yes, I'll be good too.

531
00:31:01,224 --> 00:31:02,159
At least I'm gonna try.

532
00:31:05,628 --> 00:31:07,163
This will help.

533
00:31:07,196 --> 00:31:08,932
Here...

534
00:31:08,965 --> 00:31:10,700
Call me, okay?
Anything at all, just...

535
00:31:10,701 --> 00:31:11,568
Of course, yeah.

536
00:31:11,602 --> 00:31:12,603
And work on her teens, or...

537
00:31:12,635 --> 00:31:14,070
Okay. Don't worry.

538
00:31:14,104 --> 00:31:15,139
Just go already. We're cool.

539
00:31:16,406 --> 00:31:17,474
...Glory.

540
00:31:19,076 --> 00:31:20,144
I'll see you soon.

541
00:31:21,178 --> 00:31:22,347
You be good.

542
00:31:24,213 --> 00:31:25,515
Not too many
jelly beans, okay?

543
00:31:26,683 --> 00:31:27,518
Okay.

544
00:31:29,653 --> 00:31:31,389
Okay Glory.
Come on, let's go.

545
00:31:32,556 --> 00:31:34,192
Hey, let's go.

546
00:31:35,992 --> 00:31:37,461
Come on, let's go.

547
00:31:40,029 --> 00:31:41,098
What's wrong with you?

548
00:31:42,266 --> 00:31:45,002
Hey, okay, here's the deal.

549
00:31:45,035 --> 00:31:47,971
You don't rat on me,
I don't rat on you. Got it?

550
00:31:48,005 --> 00:31:49,374
Let's go.

551
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,411
Come on, Glory.

552
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:57,214
Look, the bus is here.

553
00:31:58,449 --> 00:32:02,420
Shit,
we're on the short bus.

554
00:32:02,452 --> 00:32:04,689
Short bus! Short bus!
Short bus! Short bus!

555
00:32:04,721 --> 00:32:06,924
Short bus! Short bus!
Short bus! Short bus!

556
00:32:17,267 --> 00:32:20,203
Hey, see. A.

557
00:32:20,237 --> 00:32:22,239
A. See? Look.
That's what it looks like.

558
00:32:22,271 --> 00:32:24,508
Do this.

559
00:32:28,479 --> 00:32:30,047
It works.

560
00:32:30,079 --> 00:32:32,215
-Seriously?
-It does.

561
00:32:48,632 --> 00:32:51,068
I think, Scotty
took your logbook.

562
00:32:53,136 --> 00:32:54,739
Scotty? Scotty?

563
00:33:02,078 --> 00:33:02,980
Okay.

564
00:33:11,355 --> 00:33:14,724
Okay, so I'm saying
we did your teens

565
00:33:14,758 --> 00:33:18,129
and your...
Your sequence picture cards.

566
00:33:18,162 --> 00:33:19,297
Good.

567
00:33:20,297 --> 00:33:21,466
All right.

568
00:33:29,105 --> 00:33:31,041
That's gross.

569
00:33:31,075 --> 00:33:31,676
What's wrong with you?

570
00:33:38,548 --> 00:33:40,283
Don't move, all right?

571
00:34:21,324 --> 00:34:22,492
Glory!

572
00:34:24,293 --> 00:34:26,196
No, no, no, no, no, no!

573
00:34:28,731 --> 00:34:30,768
What the hell!
Okay, so just stay...

574
00:34:34,804 --> 00:34:36,706
Okay, don't move. I'm going
to get you down, okay?

575
00:34:37,740 --> 00:34:39,110
Don't move.

576
00:34:40,210 --> 00:34:40,845
How did you get up there?

577
00:34:42,278 --> 00:34:43,380
Don't move, okay.

578
00:34:45,282 --> 00:34:46,417
Glory!

579
00:34:46,449 --> 00:34:48,251
Stay where you are, all right?

580
00:34:48,284 --> 00:34:49,853
There's some sick
party's at State.

581
00:34:49,887 --> 00:34:52,456
We can't party. They're
going to know we're 17.

582
00:34:52,489 --> 00:34:53,523
Think things through, man.

583
00:34:53,556 --> 00:34:54,791
Who's gonna buy us
the liquor in the first place?

584
00:34:54,824 --> 00:34:58,194
Two words. Donn-a.

585
00:34:58,228 --> 00:35:00,164
My God!
Dude, stop the car.

586
00:35:00,197 --> 00:35:01,798
Just stay... Shit!

587
00:35:01,831 --> 00:35:03,333
Are you seeing this?

588
00:35:03,367 --> 00:35:04,502
My God in heaven!

589
00:35:12,608 --> 00:35:14,244
Nice going!
I got her.

590
00:35:14,878 --> 00:35:15,746
Sorry!

591
00:35:18,815 --> 00:35:20,518
-You missed the...
-I didn't see the ladder.

592
00:35:20,550 --> 00:35:21,619
...the bright yellow ladder.

593
00:35:21,652 --> 00:35:23,387
I didn't see it, but...

594
00:35:23,420 --> 00:35:24,722
It's all right.
Happens to the best of us.

595
00:35:24,755 --> 00:35:26,691
We were just taking a break.
Jeez, Bob.

596
00:35:29,492 --> 00:35:31,594
She doesn't get how
to move backwards.

597
00:35:31,628 --> 00:35:32,863
She never learned to crawl. She can't
alternate her limbs like that.

598
00:35:32,896 --> 00:35:34,499
But you knew that, right?

599
00:35:36,934 --> 00:35:38,702
Hello. Hey.

600
00:35:39,869 --> 00:35:43,173
Hey. Hey.

601
00:35:43,206 --> 00:35:44,674
-Shape is a diamond.
-What are you doing up here?

602
00:35:44,708 --> 00:35:45,910
-Shape is a diamond.
-What?

603
00:35:47,476 --> 00:35:50,947
Yeah, it's a diamond.
I see it. I see it.

604
00:35:50,981 --> 00:35:52,950
Diamond... -You can't
be up here, sweetie.

605
00:35:52,983 --> 00:35:54,952
-Diamond...
-We gotta get down, okay?

606
00:35:54,985 --> 00:35:56,921
You ready to go? Come on.

607
00:35:56,954 --> 00:35:59,957
I'll walk. I know you've
done this a million times.

608
00:35:59,989 --> 00:36:01,558
Come on, Glory. Come on.

609
00:36:01,592 --> 00:36:02,893
Slowly...

610
00:36:02,925 --> 00:36:05,728
One foot, two foot.

611
00:36:05,762 --> 00:36:07,298
There we go.

612
00:36:07,331 --> 00:36:08,432
Fourteen.

613
00:36:08,465 --> 00:36:09,800
Fourteen.

614
00:36:09,833 --> 00:36:11,735
-Fifteen.
-Fifteen.

615
00:36:11,768 --> 00:36:13,836
I did it! I did it!

616
00:36:13,869 --> 00:36:18,208
It all came back to me. Making
calls, problem solving, spreadsheet.

617
00:36:18,242 --> 00:36:19,543
Hi, Robert.

618
00:36:19,576 --> 00:36:20,978
Glory went roof-walking today.

619
00:36:21,010 --> 00:36:23,746
I forgot to warn
you about that.

620
00:36:23,780 --> 00:36:27,918
Yeah. No. I told you, it's something
about being a Pi, the empyrean.

621
00:36:27,951 --> 00:36:29,753
She loves it. Never falls.

622
00:36:31,887 --> 00:36:33,590
You a narc, Bobert?

623
00:36:35,492 --> 00:36:38,662
Getting a tan?
I could have mentioned that.

624
00:36:38,695 --> 00:36:40,898
This is Mommy's
happy face! Happy! Happy!

625
00:36:40,931 --> 00:36:42,900
Are you gonna mess
with "happy happy"?

626
00:36:42,932 --> 00:36:45,936
Mommy's, Mommy's happy face.
Happy face.

627
00:36:45,969 --> 00:36:48,606
Happy, happy, happy face.
Happy, happy, happy face.

628
00:36:50,539 --> 00:36:54,344
You completed
two full sequence pictures?

629
00:36:59,382 --> 00:37:01,818
Did you really complete two
or did you try two?

630
00:37:02,853 --> 00:37:05,889
We completely tried two,

631
00:37:05,922 --> 00:37:07,891
but, you know,
we'll do better tomorrow.

632
00:37:07,923 --> 00:37:09,427
Right, Glory?

633
00:37:22,606 --> 00:37:24,575
Knock-knock.

634
00:37:24,608 --> 00:37:26,443
You draw
all these yourself?

635
00:37:27,610 --> 00:37:29,313
They're really good.

636
00:37:29,346 --> 00:37:30,548
-What's that?
-Nothing.

637
00:37:30,981 --> 00:37:32,850
It's nothing.

638
00:37:32,882 --> 00:37:36,019
So, I got your room,
and you got this man-cave.

639
00:37:36,052 --> 00:37:38,422
I haven't been
up there in a while.

640
00:37:38,454 --> 00:37:40,590
You got a problem
with me, Robert?

641
00:37:40,623 --> 00:37:41,791
Because, you know,
the first time I saw you

642
00:37:41,824 --> 00:37:43,893
I thought maybe
we could be friends.

643
00:37:45,829 --> 00:37:47,798
You know, I'm just here
to help out Glory.

644
00:37:47,831 --> 00:37:50,501
And I know your parents
need my help too, so...

645
00:37:50,534 --> 00:37:52,570
Maybe we can try to get along.

646
00:37:53,003 --> 00:37:55,506
For their sake?

647
00:37:55,539 --> 00:37:57,441
-Okay. Yeah.
-You know...

648
00:37:57,474 --> 00:38:00,344
I could help you out too.

649
00:38:00,376 --> 00:38:03,681
With like your homework
or something?

650
00:38:03,713 --> 00:38:07,083
Okay, what... What college did
you go to again? Remind me?

651
00:38:07,117 --> 00:38:08,452
I forget.

652
00:38:09,619 --> 00:38:12,323
God, you're such an asshole.

653
00:38:12,356 --> 00:38:14,925
And what's with that
"Wah-wah" crap, anyway?

654
00:38:14,958 --> 00:38:17,394
What? Are you serious?

655
00:38:17,427 --> 00:38:19,363
Helen Keller's first word,
"Wah wah."

656
00:38:21,498 --> 00:38:23,434
Helen Keller,
Anne Sullivan...

657
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:26,369
W-A-T-E-R.

658
00:38:26,402 --> 00:38:29,505
I thought Anne Sullivan was like a
patron saint to all you therapists.

659
00:38:29,539 --> 00:38:31,975
Yeah. Well,
knock it out, Bobert.

660
00:38:32,007 --> 00:38:35,378
You look retarded.

661
00:38:35,411 --> 00:38:37,047
You know, you're not
supposed to use that word.

662
00:38:59,668 --> 00:39:01,904
Stop! Stop!

663
00:39:01,938 --> 00:39:03,640
Shit.

664
00:39:03,672 --> 00:39:04,941
Glory...

665
00:39:05,641 --> 00:39:06,777
Shut up.

666
00:39:12,481 --> 00:39:13,550
Glory, no.

667
00:39:14,083 --> 00:39:16,152
Glory!

668
00:39:16,186 --> 00:39:17,555
Glory, I...

669
00:39:18,889 --> 00:39:20,958
Just do it!

670
00:39:22,826 --> 00:39:24,594
It's okay, it's okay.

671
00:39:25,494 --> 00:39:27,431
Glory, come on, you know this.

672
00:39:27,463 --> 00:39:29,766
No, don't do that to me.

673
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:31,535
Get up, it's not noodle time.

674
00:39:31,568 --> 00:39:33,604
-Noodle.
-Get up. Glory, come on.

675
00:39:33,637 --> 00:39:35,005
What is this shape?

676
00:39:35,038 --> 00:39:36,840
-What is this shape?
-Glory, what is this shape?

677
00:39:36,873 --> 00:39:38,608
-What is this shape?
-What is this shape?

678
00:39:38,641 --> 00:39:40,009
You know this shape.

679
00:39:40,043 --> 00:39:42,112
Glory, come on.

680
00:39:42,144 --> 00:39:43,746
Get back up here, come on.

681
00:39:43,780 --> 00:39:45,482
-What is this shape?
-Glory!

682
00:39:48,818 --> 00:39:51,454
Calm down, all right?
Hey, just calm down, okay?

683
00:39:53,123 --> 00:39:54,557
Stop kicking!

684
00:39:54,590 --> 00:39:56,092
What happened?
What happened?

685
00:39:56,126 --> 00:39:58,429
-Where's the theratube?
-I don't know!

686
00:39:58,461 --> 00:40:00,030
-The theratube?
-What?..

687
00:40:00,063 --> 00:40:01,965
Her chew stick! Remember,
we went over this! -Yeah.

688
00:40:01,998 --> 00:40:03,300
Sorry. Okay. -She needs
something to chew on

689
00:40:03,333 --> 00:40:05,035
while we're getting her dressed.
Okay. Sweetie, there you go.

690
00:40:05,068 --> 00:40:07,104
Good girl. Good girl.

691
00:40:07,137 --> 00:40:09,606
All right, we went over this!

692
00:40:09,639 --> 00:40:13,577
Panties, undershirt,
then pants, then shirt.

693
00:40:13,610 --> 00:40:15,746
Don't ask me why the order
matters but it does. Okay?

694
00:40:15,778 --> 00:40:19,081
All right. I'm sorry. That's
a good girlie. All right.

695
00:40:19,114 --> 00:40:21,584
Get in your pants, and what
are we going to do now?

696
00:40:25,588 --> 00:40:26,990
Glory, stop.

697
00:40:27,923 --> 00:40:29,726
-Glory.
-Donna!

698
00:40:29,759 --> 00:40:31,728
This is a class, not a circus!

699
00:40:33,697 --> 00:40:38,202
Glory! Cut it out.
Jesus! God!

700
00:40:38,235 --> 00:40:39,836
Let's go!

701
00:40:41,804 --> 00:40:44,106
-All right.
-Shape is a diamond.

702
00:40:47,143 --> 00:40:49,146
...is a diamond.

703
00:40:49,179 --> 00:40:50,012
Diamond...

704
00:40:50,045 --> 00:40:51,181
Stop.

705
00:40:52,516 --> 00:40:53,584
Hey. Hey.

706
00:40:55,050 --> 00:40:56,554
Stay! Be good.

707
00:40:58,153 --> 00:40:59,623
I'll be back.

708
00:41:14,170 --> 00:41:15,139
Hello?

709
00:41:16,706 --> 00:41:18,876
-Jack?
-Shit!

710
00:41:19,943 --> 00:41:20,744
You. Inside.

711
00:41:22,746 --> 00:41:24,280
Hey, how's it going,
Elizabeth?

712
00:41:24,313 --> 00:41:26,916
-It's going good.
-Yeah. It's good to see you.

713
00:41:28,050 --> 00:41:29,987
You look good.

714
00:41:30,019 --> 00:41:32,155
You've completely
transformed, I see.

715
00:41:32,188 --> 00:41:33,657
-Thanks.
-After you.

716
00:41:37,827 --> 00:41:40,130
Okay, I'm going
to tell you one thing.

717
00:41:40,163 --> 00:41:42,132
Your probation officer
says you're in violation.

718
00:41:42,164 --> 00:41:45,302
And I'm instructed to call her
if you even come around here.

719
00:41:45,335 --> 00:41:47,538
Come on, Elizabeth,
don't call Miz!

720
00:41:47,570 --> 00:41:49,639
I'm going to call her
right now, unless you talk,

721
00:41:49,672 --> 00:41:51,207
and I want only the truth.

722
00:41:51,240 --> 00:41:52,943
You're going to place Coke.

723
00:41:52,976 --> 00:41:55,646
Yes, again.

724
00:41:55,679 --> 00:41:59,016
It won't be hard.
She's a cute kid.

725
00:41:59,048 --> 00:42:02,085
Can't you at least give Coke
her computer privileges back?

726
00:42:02,117 --> 00:42:05,288
So you two can plan your
next great escape? No way!

727
00:42:05,322 --> 00:42:07,291
But that's not fair. She should
be with me. I'm her family.

728
00:42:07,324 --> 00:42:09,559
I'm, I'm 18 now.

729
00:42:09,592 --> 00:42:10,560
I got a job, I got a place.

730
00:42:11,894 --> 00:42:13,730
I said, "Only the truth."

731
00:42:13,762 --> 00:42:15,898
No. That is the truth!

732
00:42:15,931 --> 00:42:17,934
I'm working as a babysitter
for a little girl.

733
00:42:17,967 --> 00:42:20,170
And she's autistic, so she
needs someone with her

734
00:42:20,202 --> 00:42:21,771
like all the time.

735
00:42:21,804 --> 00:42:23,005
And the pay is good.

736
00:42:23,039 --> 00:42:25,342
How did you even get this job?

737
00:42:25,375 --> 00:42:26,677
I convinced them.

738
00:42:26,710 --> 00:42:28,311
You lied to them.

739
00:42:28,344 --> 00:42:30,780
No. No, I'm doing a good job!

740
00:42:30,813 --> 00:42:32,848
And they really like me.
It's easy.

741
00:42:32,882 --> 00:42:36,019
I can get you
a recommendation letter!

742
00:42:36,052 --> 00:42:38,088
With their contact
information on it?

743
00:42:38,121 --> 00:42:40,190
Yeah. Yeah... Hey.

744
00:42:40,222 --> 00:42:42,224
See! See! Look!

745
00:42:42,257 --> 00:42:44,360
Look. It's real.

746
00:42:44,393 --> 00:42:45,628
See?

747
00:42:47,364 --> 00:42:49,333
How long have you been
doing this?

748
00:42:49,365 --> 00:42:52,034
I don't know. Not long.

749
00:42:52,068 --> 00:42:56,306
One month from now,
you still have this job,

750
00:42:56,338 --> 00:42:58,675
we'll talk about maybe
keeping you two together.

751
00:43:03,646 --> 00:43:04,315
No!

752
00:43:05,748 --> 00:43:06,649
Shit!

753
00:43:07,317 --> 00:43:10,186
No, shit!

754
00:43:10,219 --> 00:43:12,622
Glory? Glory? Hey!

755
00:43:13,389 --> 00:43:15,125
Shit. Glory?

756
00:43:17,193 --> 00:43:18,596
Glory?

757
00:43:19,362 --> 00:43:20,364
Glory?

758
00:43:22,364 --> 00:43:23,600
No!

759
00:43:27,903 --> 00:43:29,405
Damn! Shit!

760
00:43:37,079 --> 00:43:39,315
God!

761
00:43:39,349 --> 00:43:41,751
Where were you?

762
00:43:41,784 --> 00:43:43,920
You got to say
something, damn it!

763
00:43:52,262 --> 00:43:54,097
Hi. Mani-pedi time!

764
00:43:54,130 --> 00:43:56,199
-Want one?
-No. I'm okay. Thanks.

765
00:43:56,231 --> 00:43:59,135
My God, what's wrong with
your hands? What happened?

766
00:43:59,168 --> 00:44:01,270
I just fell.
It's no big deal.

767
00:44:03,840 --> 00:44:05,675
I smell cigarettes.
Do you smell cigarettes?

768
00:44:10,246 --> 00:44:12,148
Glory. Glory, not now.

769
00:44:12,181 --> 00:44:13,783
Say something, damn it!

770
00:44:17,920 --> 00:44:19,155
Can you watch Glory
for a moment?

771
00:44:19,188 --> 00:44:21,090
Where's Donna?

772
00:44:25,961 --> 00:44:29,166
I think she has
personal problems.

773
00:44:29,199 --> 00:44:31,768
Apparently, she didn't make it
to Sing-and-Swing at all today.

774
00:44:31,800 --> 00:44:33,335
I mean, where
the hell were they?

775
00:44:33,369 --> 00:44:36,039
And the other day I think she lied
about what they accomplished.

776
00:44:36,072 --> 00:44:37,307
Right...

777
00:44:37,340 --> 00:44:39,809
Look, but...

778
00:44:39,842 --> 00:44:41,110
She just started! Why don't
you just give her a break?

779
00:44:41,143 --> 00:44:42,712
-Give her a break?
-Yeah.

780
00:44:42,746 --> 00:44:45,248
Have you seen her with Glory?
She's rough with Glory.

781
00:44:45,280 --> 00:44:46,416
You should have
seen her hands.

782
00:44:46,449 --> 00:44:48,452
I mean, I think
she's hiding something.

783
00:44:48,485 --> 00:44:50,220
I'm going to make
some calls tomorrow.

784
00:44:50,253 --> 00:44:52,856
What, are you're gonna
quit your job?

785
00:44:52,889 --> 00:44:55,858
With one-on-one attention Glory should
be showing some improvement by now!

786
00:44:55,891 --> 00:44:58,127
Well, God forbid it's Glory's fault
she's showing no improvement!

787
00:44:58,161 --> 00:45:00,230
What did you just say?

788
00:45:00,262 --> 00:45:02,465
She's not going to be ready
for that interview. Never!

789
00:45:04,467 --> 00:45:07,269
She's 11 years old, Kay.

790
00:45:07,302 --> 00:45:08,438
When are you going to get
that through your head?

791
00:45:17,981 --> 00:45:19,850
Is this is how you really
feel about Glory?

792
00:45:20,849 --> 00:45:23,085
I'm tired.

793
00:45:23,119 --> 00:45:26,724
I don't want to feel like we're
co-workers in a mental hospital!

794
00:45:29,192 --> 00:45:31,427
I want to feel like
we're married again.

795
00:45:53,115 --> 00:45:54,518
Glory?

796
00:45:54,550 --> 00:45:56,886
Hey, come on, you can
chew on this. Come on.

797
00:45:56,920 --> 00:45:58,454
Almost ready
for school.

798
00:45:58,487 --> 00:45:59,756
Come on. Hey.

799
00:46:00,422 --> 00:46:02,191
Girl, sit up.

800
00:46:02,224 --> 00:46:04,827
You're really worth
every penny, Donna.

801
00:46:04,860 --> 00:46:06,395
Now my parents aren't even
speaking to each other.

802
00:46:09,231 --> 00:46:11,101
Glory, hey.

803
00:46:11,134 --> 00:46:13,235
You know what?

804
00:46:13,268 --> 00:46:15,037
I'm thinking you're
no Anne Sullivan.

805
00:46:19,309 --> 00:46:21,178
Glory...

806
00:46:21,210 --> 00:46:22,411
Watch out. Roll over.

807
00:46:35,425 --> 00:46:39,028
<i>W-A-T-E-R.
Water! It has a name!</i>

808
00:46:39,061 --> 00:46:39,862
<i>W-A-T...</i>

809
00:46:41,130 --> 00:46:42,132
<i>Wa...</i>

810
00:46:42,599 --> 00:46:43,500
<i>Wa...</i>

811
00:47:09,893 --> 00:47:13,262
Okay, Glory.
No more free jelly beans.

812
00:47:13,295 --> 00:47:15,064
No more cigarette breaks.

813
00:47:15,097 --> 00:47:16,398
Your ass is mine now, okay.

814
00:47:16,431 --> 00:47:18,400
Glory, no Glory, sit!

815
00:47:18,434 --> 00:47:20,003
Glory, sit...!

816
00:47:20,036 --> 00:47:21,070
Stop.

817
00:47:21,670 --> 00:47:23,472
Hey, good stop.

818
00:47:23,505 --> 00:47:25,040
That was a good stop.
That was a good stop.

819
00:47:25,074 --> 00:47:27,376
Okay. Stay.

820
00:47:27,409 --> 00:47:30,312
Yeah. Okay. Good.

821
00:47:30,346 --> 00:47:32,481
I'm going to take your cards.
I'm taking these back.

822
00:47:32,514 --> 00:47:33,983
You'll get them back after.

823
00:47:34,016 --> 00:47:36,118
It's okay. It's okay.
Just take your spoon.

824
00:47:36,152 --> 00:47:37,653
Try with a spoon.
Try with a spoon.

825
00:47:37,686 --> 00:47:39,556
No, no, no, no!

826
00:47:39,588 --> 00:47:42,092
It's okay.
Here, try another one.

827
00:47:42,125 --> 00:47:43,092
Don't freak out.

828
00:47:44,494 --> 00:47:45,562
Glory, it's okay. Come on.

829
00:47:47,063 --> 00:47:47,898
Hey, no, no, no, no, no!

830
00:47:49,132 --> 00:47:50,432
No!

831
00:47:50,465 --> 00:47:52,568
Glory, hey, calm down.

832
00:47:52,601 --> 00:47:55,071
It's okay. I'm not going
to hurt you, okay?

833
00:47:56,672 --> 00:47:58,007
Come on, let go.

834
00:47:59,442 --> 00:48:01,043
Come here!

835
00:48:09,585 --> 00:48:10,920
Calm down!

836
00:48:14,657 --> 00:48:16,626
It's okay. Okay?

837
00:48:16,659 --> 00:48:17,494
Just take a break.

838
00:48:19,228 --> 00:48:20,530
All right.

839
00:48:20,563 --> 00:48:21,465
Good.

840
00:48:23,565 --> 00:48:25,634
We're going to try this
with a spoon.

841
00:48:25,668 --> 00:48:26,603
We'll do it together, okay?

842
00:48:30,672 --> 00:48:32,508
In your mouth.

843
00:48:33,476 --> 00:48:36,947
One more time. Come on.

844
00:48:36,980 --> 00:48:39,483
Glory come on, it's just sweet
potatoes. They taste good.

845
00:48:40,282 --> 00:48:42,184
No, no.!

846
00:48:49,425 --> 00:48:51,461
Come here! Come on!

847
00:48:54,764 --> 00:48:57,267
Donna. Glory.
I'm home.

848
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:59,068
-We're in here.
-Hi.

849
00:48:59,101 --> 00:49:00,469
There you are.

850
00:49:10,045 --> 00:49:11,948
We're out of yams.

851
00:49:15,184 --> 00:49:16,720
Look, improvement!

852
00:49:16,753 --> 00:49:18,655
She's sitting down.
She's eating with her spoon.

853
00:49:27,329 --> 00:49:28,398
Show mommy, honey.

854
00:49:31,567 --> 00:49:33,235
Glory. Eat.

855
00:49:33,268 --> 00:49:34,570
Eat.

856
00:49:34,603 --> 00:49:35,739
Glory. Eat.

857
00:49:45,280 --> 00:49:46,315
Good job, girlie.

858
00:49:49,684 --> 00:49:51,487
Give me five.

859
00:49:51,521 --> 00:49:53,223
-How.
-How.

860
00:50:07,135 --> 00:50:09,371
This better be cleaned up.

861
00:50:09,405 --> 00:50:10,607
Yeah, yeah.

862
00:50:25,253 --> 00:50:27,089
Thank you, girlie!

863
00:50:27,123 --> 00:50:28,258
Thank you!

864
00:50:32,695 --> 00:50:33,730
Finally.

865
00:50:43,106 --> 00:50:45,108
What else can you do,
girlie?

866
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:55,585
Glory, you in here?

867
00:51:49,505 --> 00:51:51,141
-Hey, Kay.
-Hi.

868
00:51:51,173 --> 00:51:53,242
I am so sorry
I'm calling so late.

869
00:51:54,876 --> 00:51:56,480
<i>Is Glory bouncing
off the walls?</i>

870
00:51:58,347 --> 00:51:59,916
She's good.

871
00:51:59,949 --> 00:52:02,552
Good...

872
00:52:02,585 --> 00:52:05,255
Donna, listen, I... I know
this is not part of our deal,

873
00:52:05,288 --> 00:52:06,923
<i>but this audit.</i>

874
00:52:06,956 --> 00:52:08,658
No, it's okay.
Just spit it out. It's fine.

875
00:52:08,690 --> 00:52:10,426
Is there any chance
you could help with dinner?

876
00:52:12,494 --> 00:52:14,297
Forget it, forget it.
I shouldn't have asked.

877
00:52:14,329 --> 00:52:18,268
No, it's fine! I just,
I don't know how to cook.

878
00:52:18,300 --> 00:52:22,538
No, not anything elaborate, just
make spaghetti or something.

879
00:52:22,572 --> 00:52:23,507
How do you make spaghetti?

880
00:52:28,610 --> 00:52:31,580
Okay, I'll just walk
you through it.

881
00:52:31,614 --> 00:52:33,382
All right, okay.
So what's the first step?

882
00:52:33,416 --> 00:52:34,885
Okay, so there's a pot...

883
00:52:52,902 --> 00:52:54,403
Watch your step.

884
00:52:55,570 --> 00:52:56,706
There she is.

885
00:52:58,007 --> 00:52:59,476
Hey, Bethany.

886
00:53:00,443 --> 00:53:01,545
Bethany.

887
00:53:02,478 --> 00:53:04,713
Come here.

888
00:53:04,746 --> 00:53:06,215
I've a couple of people
I'd like you to meet.

889
00:53:08,351 --> 00:53:11,387
Just give her a little time,
she's been through a lot.

890
00:53:18,393 --> 00:53:21,730
Well, I looked online and I gotta get
my classes in by the end of the month.

891
00:53:21,764 --> 00:53:23,298
We gotta figure out what
dorm room I'm staying in.

892
00:53:23,331 --> 00:53:24,900
Focus on some work study.
Get some money in there.

893
00:53:24,934 --> 00:53:26,669
What do you think
about food too?

894
00:53:26,702 --> 00:53:29,405
The food at these
colleges is terrible.

895
00:53:29,438 --> 00:53:31,273
I mean, you've seen what
those kids eat, we can't.

896
00:53:31,306 --> 00:53:33,542
We're gonna have to get you
something healthy.

897
00:53:33,576 --> 00:53:35,043
I need to figure out where I'm
staying, not what I'm gonna eat...

898
00:53:35,077 --> 00:53:37,447
They'll tell you where you're staying.
This food is delicious.

899
00:53:37,480 --> 00:53:39,282
Yeah, quinoa's really high in protein.
Really?

900
00:53:39,315 --> 00:53:40,682
-I did know that.
-I need more.

901
00:53:40,715 --> 00:53:41,951
I need more. Give me more.

902
00:53:41,983 --> 00:53:42,918
-Here, protein.
-Delicious.

903
00:53:45,353 --> 00:53:47,356
Glory?

904
00:53:47,389 --> 00:53:48,924
What's she saying?

905
00:53:48,958 --> 00:53:50,593
I don't know.

906
00:53:50,626 --> 00:53:53,028
We haven't figured
that one out.

907
00:53:53,061 --> 00:53:54,896
We think it has something to do with
the conflict in the Middle East!

908
00:53:54,929 --> 00:53:57,666
Or maybe she's saying, "Daddy's
really fat! Daddy's really fat!"

909
00:53:57,699 --> 00:54:00,302
-Daddy's not fat.
-Daddy sometimes is fat.

910
00:54:00,335 --> 00:54:02,538
I want tatos please.

911
00:54:02,570 --> 00:54:04,039
I want tatos please.

912
00:54:04,072 --> 00:54:06,041
-Good asking, Glory!
-I want tatos please.

913
00:54:06,074 --> 00:54:07,743
Okay. Here you go.

914
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,012
-This is awesome!
-Pretty awesome!

915
00:54:10,045 --> 00:54:11,513
-I want tatos please.
-This is amazing.

916
00:54:11,547 --> 00:54:12,715
I just gave you some.

917
00:54:14,617 --> 00:54:15,952
Okay.

918
00:54:15,985 --> 00:54:16,786
Who's that?

919
00:54:17,920 --> 00:54:18,887
Mommy.

920
00:54:19,954 --> 00:54:21,824
Mommy.

921
00:54:21,856 --> 00:54:23,293
Good. Good.

922
00:54:23,958 --> 00:54:25,327
And who's that?

923
00:54:25,360 --> 00:54:26,629
Hey. Who's that?

924
00:54:29,030 --> 00:54:30,967
That's you, Glory. That's you.

925
00:54:32,934 --> 00:54:34,304
That's you.

926
00:54:34,903 --> 00:54:36,639
No, I'm Jack.

927
00:54:37,672 --> 00:54:39,341
I'm Jack.

928
00:54:40,876 --> 00:54:44,747
You're Glory, I'm Jack.

929
00:54:44,780 --> 00:54:48,084
Glory. Glory. Glory.
Jack. Jack. Jack.

930
00:54:48,117 --> 00:54:50,053
Jack. Jack. Jack.

931
00:54:50,085 --> 00:54:53,021
No, no, no, no. Donna. Donna.
Donna. -Jack. Jack. Jack.

932
00:54:53,054 --> 00:54:55,057
Jack, Jack, Jack.

933
00:54:55,090 --> 00:54:56,826
Jack. Jack.

934
00:55:01,630 --> 00:55:03,666
It's been open
for about three months.

935
00:55:03,699 --> 00:55:05,668
Well, you know, it was
modeled after a lab school

936
00:55:05,701 --> 00:55:08,771
at the University of Chicago,
which I toured.

937
00:55:08,804 --> 00:55:10,539
So, you know.
ABA, everything...

938
00:55:10,572 --> 00:55:11,641
All under one roof!

939
00:55:11,673 --> 00:55:13,342
I know.

940
00:55:13,376 --> 00:55:15,978
Are you guys talking
about that new school?

941
00:55:16,010 --> 00:55:18,715
Glory has an interview there.

942
00:55:18,748 --> 00:55:21,016
Glory got an interview?
Are you kidding?

943
00:55:21,951 --> 00:55:22,818
Why?

944
00:55:24,119 --> 00:55:26,623
Not exactly her speed,
if you know what I mean.

945
00:55:27,789 --> 00:55:30,025
No. I don't know
what you mean.

946
00:55:30,059 --> 00:55:33,530
I mean, she's low functioning.
She'll never get in.

947
00:55:35,431 --> 00:55:37,067
Gosh. Good luck.

948
00:55:38,166 --> 00:55:39,435
I'm afraid she'll need it.

949
00:55:44,840 --> 00:55:45,942
Come on, Glory.

950
00:55:51,480 --> 00:55:53,449
Low functioning, my ass.

951
00:55:55,150 --> 00:55:58,019
Yo girl,
this place is crazy.

952
00:55:58,052 --> 00:56:00,021
What's with all of this?

953
00:56:00,054 --> 00:56:02,591
Yo Daisy, hold on.
I just gotta...

954
00:56:02,625 --> 00:56:03,925
All right, just sit.

955
00:56:03,958 --> 00:56:06,728
Just sit right there. Stay.

956
00:56:06,762 --> 00:56:09,632
I'm going to go and pick some stuff
out for you, okay? Don't move.

957
00:56:10,699 --> 00:56:12,501
Yo, this shit is wack.

958
00:56:12,534 --> 00:56:14,170
What up?

959
00:56:14,202 --> 00:56:15,938
See? It's like
a survival kit, you know,

960
00:56:15,971 --> 00:56:17,606
for when
the lights are too bright,

961
00:56:17,639 --> 00:56:18,474
when it's too noisy
and shit...

962
00:56:19,074 --> 00:56:21,476
And this too.

963
00:56:21,510 --> 00:56:23,913
-Why?
-Because it's fun.

964
00:56:23,945 --> 00:56:25,847
Okay, I gotta fly.
Bye, boo-boo.

965
00:56:25,880 --> 00:56:27,783
Hey, Dais?

966
00:56:27,817 --> 00:56:28,650
Live big.

967
00:56:30,652 --> 00:56:31,721
Hey.

968
00:56:31,753 --> 00:56:33,522
Glory?

969
00:56:35,824 --> 00:56:37,460
Glory?

970
00:56:37,492 --> 00:56:39,528
Hey, Glory?

971
00:56:39,561 --> 00:56:42,097
This isn't funny.

972
00:56:42,130 --> 00:56:43,799
Excuse me,
did you see a little girl?

973
00:56:43,833 --> 00:56:45,934
-Yeah. She just left.
-What?

974
00:56:45,967 --> 00:56:47,103
Shit!

975
00:56:47,135 --> 00:56:48,471
Glory?

976
00:56:49,838 --> 00:56:50,840
Glory?

977
00:56:51,873 --> 00:56:52,908
Glory?

978
00:56:57,646 --> 00:56:59,449
Have you seen a little girl?

979
00:57:01,217 --> 00:57:02,485
Hi...

980
00:57:03,152 --> 00:57:04,554
I lost Glory.

981
00:57:06,554 --> 00:57:07,456
All right,
just stop the car.

982
00:57:07,489 --> 00:57:10,225
Stop, stop.

983
00:57:10,259 --> 00:57:12,161
I'm so sorry. I just looked away
for a second... -No, no, no.

984
00:57:12,193 --> 00:57:15,096
-She just takes off. I understand.
-Okay.

985
00:57:15,130 --> 00:57:16,666
Where could she be?

986
00:57:19,735 --> 00:57:21,171
I got an idea. Come on.

987
00:57:23,873 --> 00:57:25,608
Dudley, come on.

988
00:57:25,641 --> 00:57:27,143
No, she goes
to this park sometimes.

989
00:57:27,175 --> 00:57:29,144
It's like her
little happy place.

990
00:57:29,177 --> 00:57:31,580
There she is!

991
00:57:31,614 --> 00:57:32,581
See, I told you.
She loves it here.

992
00:57:34,916 --> 00:57:35,985
Shit,
she's gonna fall.

993
00:57:36,018 --> 00:57:37,086
No, she's fine dude.
She's safe.

994
00:57:37,119 --> 00:57:38,488
She never falls.

995
00:57:42,123 --> 00:57:43,692
Yo, check out who it is.

996
00:57:43,726 --> 00:57:45,894
-Shit...
-Yo, Robby.

997
00:57:45,927 --> 00:57:47,996
You want me to help you? -No.
Just wait here and watch Glory.

998
00:57:48,030 --> 00:57:50,233
-Hey, guys.
-How's it going, man?

999
00:57:50,266 --> 00:57:51,733
Long time, no see?

1000
00:57:51,766 --> 00:57:53,935
Who are those guys?

1001
00:57:53,969 --> 00:57:56,938
They look like assholes
to me, I don't know.

1002
00:57:56,972 --> 00:57:59,108
You said you were gonna
matriculate in the State, man.

1003
00:57:59,141 --> 00:58:02,778
Yeah. I, I didn't get into the other
ones, so we're just kind of...

1004
00:58:02,811 --> 00:58:04,280
No way.

1005
00:58:04,313 --> 00:58:05,748
Hey, Glory.

1006
00:58:05,780 --> 00:58:07,282
How the hell
did you get up here?

1007
00:58:07,315 --> 00:58:09,951
You're like
a little red-headed ninja.

1008
00:58:09,985 --> 00:58:10,619
What about Yale? Princeton?

1009
00:58:11,887 --> 00:58:13,089
Same thing. I got waitlisted.

1010
00:58:13,755 --> 00:58:14,956
Dude...

1011
00:58:14,989 --> 00:58:17,526
Pathetic.
What happened to you?

1012
00:58:17,559 --> 00:58:20,063
What happened?
Hey, baby...

1013
00:58:23,699 --> 00:58:25,867
Come on, let's go.

1014
00:58:25,900 --> 00:58:29,271
-Later.
-Wait, wait. What was that?

1015
00:58:29,304 --> 00:58:32,641
Annoying is what it was, I mean,
Princeton, Yale, who gives a shit?

1016
00:58:33,041 --> 00:58:34,777
Yeah.

1017
00:58:34,809 --> 00:58:37,880
Who does? -Guys, guys!
Glory just talked to me!

1018
00:58:37,913 --> 00:58:40,016
-What'd she say?
-What?

1019
00:58:40,048 --> 00:58:41,518
Okay. So, I was talking
to her and I asked

1020
00:58:41,519 --> 00:58:42,851
her how many fingers
I was holding up,

1021
00:58:42,885 --> 00:58:45,755
and she said four and I was
actually holding up four fingers!

1022
00:58:45,788 --> 00:58:47,856
Alert the media, dude.
She does that all the time.

1023
00:58:49,358 --> 00:58:51,227
Hi, Jack. Hijack? See.
She's just babbling.

1024
00:58:53,228 --> 00:58:54,730
No, she actually
was talking to me.

1025
00:58:54,762 --> 00:58:55,663
I'm telling you, man,
she's just babbling.

1026
00:58:55,697 --> 00:58:56,130
She's never done that before.
Now four?

1027
00:58:58,300 --> 00:58:59,835
-Four.
-Yeah. Four.

1028
00:58:59,867 --> 00:59:01,770
There's something weird...

1029
00:59:01,804 --> 00:59:03,204
I don't know
about being up high.

1030
00:59:03,237 --> 00:59:05,574
It's like it makes her smarter
or something up there.

1031
00:59:08,110 --> 00:59:10,246
That thing you said
the first day, the...

1032
00:59:10,278 --> 00:59:12,014
-The empyrean.
-Yeah.

1033
00:59:12,047 --> 00:59:14,817
It's like reaching at the
highest point of the heavens.

1034
00:59:14,849 --> 00:59:16,251
She's reaching for the stars.

1035
00:59:18,253 --> 00:59:19,121
That's our Glory.

1036
00:59:21,155 --> 00:59:23,326
Thanks, by the way,
for not giving me shit.

1037
00:59:23,358 --> 00:59:25,694
We've all done it.
Seriously, it's all right.

1038
00:59:26,996 --> 00:59:27,896
And...

1039
00:59:29,764 --> 00:59:30,732
Thanks for that.

1040
00:59:31,400 --> 00:59:33,336
Yeah.

1041
00:59:38,373 --> 00:59:43,612
Mom and Dad would jump
at the latest thing,

1042
00:59:43,646 --> 00:59:46,248
spare no expense
when it came to Glory.

1043
00:59:46,280 --> 00:59:51,286
Any gadget, any quack
who had the cure.

1044
00:59:51,320 --> 00:59:56,659
The compounding pharmacy
designer digestive enzymes...

1045
00:59:56,692 --> 00:59:58,360
...the trips to the hyperbaric
oxygen chamber...

1046
01:00:02,164 --> 01:00:05,901
And the one thing I wanted was
the amazing ab electrifier.

1047
01:00:05,934 --> 01:00:07,303
Yes.

1048
01:00:07,335 --> 01:00:09,704
I wanted it very badly.

1049
01:00:09,737 --> 01:00:11,373
And they said no.

1050
01:00:11,407 --> 01:00:14,076
And I couldn't believe it!

1051
01:00:14,108 --> 01:00:16,679
They said it was a gimmick
and everything.

1052
01:00:16,711 --> 01:00:18,648
I was 13! I wanted
the amazing ab electrifier.

1053
01:00:19,248 --> 01:00:20,617
Yeah.

1054
01:00:22,684 --> 01:00:25,020
Those guys were my friends

1055
01:00:25,054 --> 01:00:28,958
up until my parents couldn't afford
to take me to McAllister's anymore.

1056
01:00:28,990 --> 01:00:30,159
So I started going
to public school, and...

1057
01:00:31,293 --> 01:00:33,028
Dudley?

1058
01:00:33,061 --> 01:00:34,130
Exactly.

1059
01:00:59,253 --> 01:01:02,290
So does this mean you're going
to stop calling me Bobert now?

1060
01:01:03,992 --> 01:01:05,394
Maybe.

1061
01:01:09,030 --> 01:01:09,931
Glory, I'm home.

1062
01:01:09,965 --> 01:01:12,168
I...

1063
01:01:12,201 --> 01:01:14,336
Glory, come on.
Hey, Glory, come on.

1064
01:01:16,771 --> 01:01:18,974
Dudley, okay, it happened man.

1065
01:01:19,007 --> 01:01:21,110
Just...
Just a few minutes ago.

1066
01:01:21,143 --> 01:01:23,445
<i>-It was like...
-Dude, that's statutory rape!</i>

1067
01:01:23,478 --> 01:01:25,847
<i>You're going
to put her in jail.</i>

1068
01:01:25,880 --> 01:01:27,982
We're not having sex, man. Just
get your head out of the dirt.

1069
01:01:28,016 --> 01:01:30,152
This is... This was a moment.
This was real.

1070
01:01:30,184 --> 01:01:32,822
This was us.
I kissed a woman!

1071
01:01:32,855 --> 01:01:35,123
<i>Okay. But if she's in jail, how are we
going to get the booze for the party?</i>

1072
01:01:35,157 --> 01:01:37,293
This was just...

1073
01:01:37,326 --> 01:01:38,449
Okay, you're not getting this.

1074
01:01:38,450 --> 01:01:40,697
I can't talk to you right
now. I'll see you tomorrow.

1075
01:01:49,271 --> 01:01:50,840
Shit!

1076
01:01:50,873 --> 01:01:52,307
Shit! Shit! Shit!

1077
01:01:53,442 --> 01:01:55,445
Okay, how many more days?

1078
01:01:56,545 --> 01:01:58,414
Nineteen. Shit!

1079
01:02:01,349 --> 01:02:03,219
Stupid!

1080
01:02:06,487 --> 01:02:08,490
-Hey.
-Okay, okay.

1081
01:02:08,523 --> 01:02:13,161
This is completely inappropriate
and it stops now.

1082
01:02:13,195 --> 01:02:14,296
-What do you mean, we were just...
-The park...

1083
01:02:14,329 --> 01:02:16,932
That was totally my fault.

1084
01:02:16,965 --> 01:02:19,501
I was just trying to help
you out, but...

1085
01:02:19,534 --> 01:02:22,404
The second time, the swings,
that was... That was totally you.

1086
01:02:25,940 --> 01:02:28,042
Okay, well, we need
a tiebreaker.

1087
01:02:28,076 --> 01:02:29,911
-What?
-A tiebreaker.

1088
01:02:32,246 --> 01:02:33,815
One more?

1089
01:02:33,849 --> 01:02:34,751
All right.

1090
01:02:35,550 --> 01:02:37,186
Yeah. Okay...

1091
01:02:37,219 --> 01:02:38,354
All right.

1092
01:02:46,061 --> 01:02:48,396
Okay, that should
hold you, Robert.

1093
01:03:03,277 --> 01:03:04,480
Hero. Hero.

1094
01:03:05,581 --> 01:03:07,316
Glory.

1095
01:03:07,349 --> 01:03:09,318
-Hey, Glory.
-How did you know that?

1096
01:03:09,351 --> 01:03:12,387
Hero.

1097
01:03:12,420 --> 01:03:14,022
She heard it all the way
from the kitchen.

1098
01:03:14,056 --> 01:03:17,059
-I can't believe it.
-It's a special song.

1099
01:03:17,092 --> 01:03:17,994
-Hero.
-I'm getting there.

1100
01:03:18,460 --> 01:03:20,128
Ready?

1101
01:03:44,952 --> 01:03:46,054
Ready?

1102
01:04:12,681 --> 01:04:15,650
Let me see if I remember
this next verse.

1103
01:04:33,702 --> 01:04:36,138
Ready?

1104
01:06:29,451 --> 01:06:31,786
I know,
you almost got it.

1105
01:06:31,820 --> 01:06:33,655
We just have one
more arm. Come on.

1106
01:06:33,688 --> 01:06:35,257
We're almost there.
I know.

1107
01:06:35,289 --> 01:06:37,793
-Having some trouble?
-Yeah. Almost.

1108
01:06:37,826 --> 01:06:41,630
Hey, let's try this. Hey, Glory,
squishy time. Squishy time!

1109
01:06:41,663 --> 01:06:44,333
Let me try this, okay.

1110
01:06:44,365 --> 01:06:45,501
Yeah, lay down.
She loves this.

1111
01:06:47,335 --> 01:06:48,670
-Squish, squish.
-Yeah, come on. Lay down.

1112
01:06:48,702 --> 01:06:50,038
Works every time.

1113
01:06:50,072 --> 01:06:51,673
We can do this
any time of the day.

1114
01:06:51,706 --> 01:06:53,307
Ready? Yes?
We're going to wrap you up

1115
01:06:53,340 --> 01:06:54,643
like a cheese roll.

1116
01:06:54,675 --> 01:06:56,711
You're going to look
like a burrito,

1117
01:06:56,744 --> 01:06:58,614
with rice and beans.

1118
01:06:58,646 --> 01:07:00,349
And then we're going to lift you up.
Lift up her legs.

1119
01:07:00,382 --> 01:07:03,318
And we're gonna
swing you, right?

1120
01:07:03,351 --> 01:07:06,288
Say one, two...

1121
01:07:06,855 --> 01:07:09,090
Three...

1122
01:07:09,123 --> 01:07:10,725
Squishy! I got you!

1123
01:07:10,759 --> 01:07:13,128
Squishy! Squishy!

1124
01:07:13,161 --> 01:07:16,565
-Squishy! Squishy!
-Squishy! Squishy!

1125
01:07:16,597 --> 01:07:19,300
-Squishy!
-You get her cozy.

1126
01:07:19,333 --> 01:07:21,803
It doesn't have to be all work
and therapy. You can try this.

1127
01:07:23,438 --> 01:07:25,773
She likes Casper.

1128
01:07:25,806 --> 01:07:28,176
I don't understand
the mysterious power

1129
01:07:28,210 --> 01:07:29,510
of Casper,
the Friendly Ghost, but...

1130
01:07:29,543 --> 01:07:30,378
See you later.

1131
01:07:32,414 --> 01:07:33,749
Take care of her.

1132
01:07:33,782 --> 01:07:36,085
Casper? Okay.

1133
01:08:05,514 --> 01:08:07,282
<i>-In the spice cabinet.
-Cabinet. Spice cabinet.</i>

1134
01:08:07,315 --> 01:08:09,885
<i>-Which cabinet is that?
-Left of the dishwasher.</i>

1135
01:08:09,918 --> 01:08:11,653
<i>-Eye level.
-What's it look like?</i>

1136
01:08:13,288 --> 01:08:16,658
Low sodium beef?

1137
01:08:16,690 --> 01:08:19,394
Yeah, got it. Found it.

1138
01:08:19,426 --> 01:08:21,529
<i>-How many?
-Just one.</i>

1139
01:08:21,563 --> 01:08:23,198
One.

1140
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:24,466
Yeah, I got it. Okay.

1141
01:08:26,902 --> 01:08:29,270
What else?

1142
01:08:29,304 --> 01:08:31,739
<i>I don't know. What else
have you got? Tomato?</i>

1143
01:08:31,773 --> 01:08:33,509
Yeah. I'll get
the tomatoes. Yeah.

1144
01:08:34,943 --> 01:08:36,278
Okay.

1145
01:09:10,444 --> 01:09:12,447
Sorry. Too loud?

1146
01:09:12,479 --> 01:09:15,384
No, I... I just
couldn't sleep.

1147
01:09:16,850 --> 01:09:17,685
Come sit down.

1148
01:09:21,622 --> 01:09:23,591
You like the book?

1149
01:09:23,625 --> 01:09:26,295
I love it. Thank you so much.
It's great.

1150
01:09:27,761 --> 01:09:29,164
It really helps.

1151
01:09:40,841 --> 01:09:42,577
I'm going to get some...
Something to drink.

1152
01:09:46,448 --> 01:09:47,483
A fraud.

1153
01:09:49,884 --> 01:09:51,186
What?

1154
01:09:52,554 --> 01:09:54,523
That's what I feel like.

1155
01:09:56,291 --> 01:10:00,229
I've been out of the workforce
too long. Everything's different.

1156
01:10:00,261 --> 01:10:01,963
Nobody takes notes
on actual paper anymore!

1157
01:10:01,997 --> 01:10:05,667
They don't even talk on the
phone, everything is emailing.

1158
01:10:05,699 --> 01:10:08,737
I just don't know the tech
stuff like these kids all do.

1159
01:10:08,770 --> 01:10:11,974
Half the time I don't even know
what they're talking about.

1160
01:10:12,006 --> 01:10:14,576
I just feel like
I'm faking it all day long.

1161
01:10:18,012 --> 01:10:19,981
Well, I'm sure you're
doing the best you can.

1162
01:10:23,484 --> 01:10:24,786
Night.

1163
01:10:24,819 --> 01:10:25,921
Good night, Donna.

1164
01:10:38,065 --> 01:10:40,601
Gil, here's Mr. Riley.

1165
01:10:40,635 --> 01:10:42,538
Good save.

1166
01:10:43,872 --> 01:10:45,507
See you tomorrow.

1167
01:10:45,539 --> 01:10:46,774
Say
"See you tomorrow," Scotty.

1168
01:10:46,807 --> 01:10:47,842
Bye, Scotty.

1169
01:10:57,786 --> 01:10:59,587
What is it?

1170
01:11:00,988 --> 01:11:01,889
Red.

1171
01:11:03,425 --> 01:11:05,360
-Good.
-Red.

1172
01:11:05,393 --> 01:11:06,528
What's the shape?

1173
01:11:11,032 --> 01:11:15,304
What is the shape?
The shape is a heart.

1174
01:11:16,604 --> 01:11:17,773
What's the card?

1175
01:11:20,341 --> 01:11:21,609
What's the card?

1176
01:11:23,011 --> 01:11:24,313
Is it jack?

1177
01:11:25,646 --> 01:11:26,649
Jack...

1178
01:11:29,016 --> 01:11:32,453
Jack of the red hearts.

1179
01:11:33,921 --> 01:11:35,023
Good.

1180
01:11:36,925 --> 01:11:37,793
Good.

1181
01:11:42,930 --> 01:11:44,632
Yeah.

1182
01:12:12,993 --> 01:12:13,996
Whoo!

1183
01:12:32,479 --> 01:12:33,781
Jelly beans! Jelly beans!

1184
01:12:46,627 --> 01:12:50,098
Hi, there. Is this, is this
Elizabeth Dunn from Hollygrove?

1185
01:12:53,001 --> 01:12:55,804
Hey, there. Okay. This is
gonna sound really weird,

1186
01:12:55,837 --> 01:12:58,707
but do you know a...
A Jacquelyn Ferguson?

1187
01:13:08,850 --> 01:13:10,152
All right, this is fine.
Thanks.

1188
01:13:11,819 --> 01:13:13,822
All right, Glory,
we're here.

1189
01:13:15,023 --> 01:13:16,859
Come on. Come on.

1190
01:13:18,059 --> 01:13:19,628
I got you. Let's go.

1191
01:13:20,462 --> 01:13:22,130
Yeah.

1192
01:13:22,162 --> 01:13:23,898
Good girl. Good girl.

1193
01:13:23,931 --> 01:13:26,434
Come on.

1194
01:13:26,467 --> 01:13:29,104
Thanks.

1195
01:13:29,136 --> 01:13:32,206
I know it's bright.
It'll be cool inside. Come on.

1196
01:13:32,239 --> 01:13:33,841
Glory, come on.

1197
01:13:33,875 --> 01:13:36,444
Hey. We're just going
to do this, okay?

1198
01:13:36,478 --> 01:13:38,447
We're just going
to go over here.

1199
01:13:38,479 --> 01:13:41,682
Yeah. I'm going to talk with this
lady and you, play with the fish.

1200
01:13:41,716 --> 01:13:43,118
All right?

1201
01:13:43,150 --> 01:13:45,953
Hi...

1202
01:13:45,987 --> 01:13:50,625
I have these forms and I just
wanted to find out where I...

1203
01:13:50,658 --> 01:13:52,027
Who I turn them in to.

1204
01:14:00,167 --> 01:14:04,072
No! No! No!

1205
01:14:04,104 --> 01:14:07,575
No! No! -Glory, Glory. Glory.
Stop, stop, stop, stop...

1206
01:14:07,609 --> 01:14:11,513
No! No! No! No! No! No! -Stop it.
Stop it, stop. Don't hurt yourself.

1207
01:14:11,546 --> 01:14:13,248
No! No! -Get your
hands off that child!

1208
01:14:13,280 --> 01:14:15,484
-What are you doing?
-It's okay, she's autistic.

1209
01:14:15,516 --> 01:14:17,051
-She's just having a tantrum...
-Little girl, are you okay?

1210
01:14:17,085 --> 01:14:18,752
-No!
-Don't touch her.

1211
01:14:18,786 --> 01:14:20,755
I'm her companion, okay?

1212
01:14:20,787 --> 01:14:23,658
-She doesn't speak!
-No. No.

1213
01:14:25,059 --> 01:14:26,994
-No.
-What's your name!

1214
01:14:27,028 --> 01:14:27,996
No.

1215
01:14:31,231 --> 01:14:32,701
What's your name?

1216
01:14:39,073 --> 01:14:40,676
It's Donna...

1217
01:14:43,545 --> 01:14:46,213
Excuse me, room 203 please?
203?

1218
01:14:46,247 --> 01:14:47,583
Thank you.

1219
01:14:50,818 --> 01:14:52,753
-Honey, are you scared?
-Scared.

1220
01:14:52,787 --> 01:14:55,557
-Are you hurt?
-Hurt.

1221
01:14:55,590 --> 01:14:57,025
It's... It's called
echolalia, miss.

1222
01:14:59,827 --> 01:15:02,831
I saw this young lady holding
the girl's arms very roughly...

1223
01:15:02,863 --> 01:15:05,933
Yes, and she probably saved her from...
From running off.

1224
01:15:05,966 --> 01:15:07,536
Glory's stronger
than she looks.

1225
01:15:07,569 --> 01:15:10,639
I... I have absolute
confidence in our helper here.

1226
01:15:10,671 --> 01:15:13,541
Okay, Donna, let's go. I'm
sorry we've wasted your time.

1227
01:15:16,043 --> 01:15:19,314
You take my daughter to Family
and Children's Services?

1228
01:15:19,346 --> 01:15:22,050
Do you know what
those people can do?

1229
01:15:22,082 --> 01:15:25,819
Is there something we've done
that you disagree with?

1230
01:15:25,853 --> 01:15:28,789
Do you feel Glory's
not being treated well?

1231
01:15:28,823 --> 01:15:30,892
It has nothing to do
with you, Kay.

1232
01:15:30,925 --> 01:15:32,895
It has nothing
to do with this.

1233
01:15:35,296 --> 01:15:39,768
I just don't want you
to not like me.

1234
01:15:42,936 --> 01:15:43,838
What could possibly...

1235
01:15:48,176 --> 01:15:51,279
Listen, we...
We all have made our mistakes,

1236
01:15:51,311 --> 01:15:53,548
we all have our regrets.

1237
01:15:55,216 --> 01:15:58,153
I know I didn't make
Glory autistic. But...

1238
01:16:00,755 --> 01:16:04,059
But when I started to see signs
that something's wrong, I...

1239
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:07,595
I just couldn't face it.

1240
01:16:10,731 --> 01:16:14,836
The only thing... The only
thing everyone agrees on is...

1241
01:16:14,868 --> 01:16:16,203
Is early intervention.

1242
01:16:17,204 --> 01:16:18,940
The most crucial years.

1243
01:16:20,108 --> 01:16:22,210
And I missed it.

1244
01:16:22,243 --> 01:16:24,312
Where would Glory be
if we'd started earlier?

1245
01:16:24,345 --> 01:16:25,681
Would she...

1246
01:16:27,047 --> 01:16:28,716
Would she be able to relate?

1247
01:16:30,917 --> 01:16:32,653
Would she have friends?

1248
01:16:33,988 --> 01:16:35,691
Would she call me Mommy?

1249
01:16:38,192 --> 01:16:42,896
What can I do about it now?
Except my best, now...

1250
01:16:42,930 --> 01:16:45,900
It doesn't help her
if I beat myself up over it.

1251
01:16:45,932 --> 01:16:47,801
Now tell me,
what were you doing

1252
01:16:47,835 --> 01:16:49,871
at Family and
Children's Services?

1253
01:16:53,408 --> 01:16:55,010
I have a sister.

1254
01:16:55,976 --> 01:16:57,778
Okay.

1255
01:16:57,811 --> 01:17:02,984
We were in foster care
after my, mom got sick.

1256
01:17:04,886 --> 01:17:06,822
And, my mom,

1257
01:17:08,389 --> 01:17:11,059
she didn't have anybody.

1258
01:17:12,460 --> 01:17:13,662
Any family.

1259
01:17:16,130 --> 01:17:17,699
So, after she...

1260
01:17:19,833 --> 01:17:22,336
Yeah. We...
We didn't have anybody either.

1261
01:17:23,738 --> 01:17:24,806
She died?

1262
01:17:25,872 --> 01:17:26,807
Yeah.

1263
01:17:30,177 --> 01:17:32,346
The last thing
she said to us was,

1264
01:17:34,948 --> 01:17:36,817
"You two take care
of each other."

1265
01:17:39,319 --> 01:17:41,389
It's like our...

1266
01:17:41,421 --> 01:17:42,957
It's like our code, you know.

1267
01:17:44,759 --> 01:17:45,860
U.2.T.C.

1268
01:17:48,863 --> 01:17:51,833
So, that's...
That's why I was here.

1269
01:17:53,333 --> 01:17:55,237
I got to get my sister back.

1270
01:17:58,372 --> 01:17:59,975
I'm sorry, honey.

1271
01:18:01,341 --> 01:18:03,777
It's gonna be okay.

1272
01:18:03,810 --> 01:18:05,447
We're gonna get
your sister back.

1273
01:18:06,514 --> 01:18:07,916
I'm gonna help you.

1274
01:18:08,381 --> 01:18:09,451
Okay.

1275
01:18:09,951 --> 01:18:11,019
Okay.

1276
01:18:11,918 --> 01:18:13,988
I'm so sorry.

1277
01:18:14,020 --> 01:18:15,389
-It's okay.
-Okay.

1278
01:18:21,229 --> 01:18:22,998
Hey. Whose is that?

1279
01:18:33,039 --> 01:18:34,842
Donna, come on.
Let's go.

1280
01:18:35,909 --> 01:18:36,912
Just...

1281
01:18:39,380 --> 01:18:42,751
I am so sorry, Mr. Adams.
It's a lifelong pattern.

1282
01:18:42,783 --> 01:18:44,384
She's smoking cigarettes. She's
smoking cigarettes in the house!

1283
01:18:44,417 --> 01:18:46,086
No concern for the law.

1284
01:18:46,119 --> 01:18:48,890
Child endangerment.
Criminal trespassing.

1285
01:18:48,922 --> 01:18:50,492
-Honey?
-Theft.

1286
01:18:50,524 --> 01:18:52,960
-Breaking and entering.
-Honey?

1287
01:18:52,993 --> 01:18:54,429
In here.
Donna's room.

1288
01:18:54,462 --> 01:18:56,264
I can explain.

1289
01:18:56,296 --> 01:18:58,031
-Is that your wife?
-Yeah, that's my wife.

1290
01:18:58,064 --> 01:19:00,335
What are you all doing
in Donna's room?

1291
01:19:00,368 --> 01:19:02,036
That's not her name, Mom.

1292
01:19:02,069 --> 01:19:03,972
What? Excuse me, who are you?

1293
01:19:04,005 --> 01:19:05,239
I'm her probation officer.

1294
01:19:05,273 --> 01:19:06,807
Probation officer?

1295
01:19:06,841 --> 01:19:09,177
Hello, Jacquelyn.
Been looking for you.

1296
01:19:09,210 --> 01:19:11,179
Jacquelyn?

1297
01:19:11,212 --> 01:19:14,115
Whatever she told you,
it's not the whole truth.

1298
01:19:14,148 --> 01:19:16,217
I swear I can explain...

1299
01:19:16,250 --> 01:19:19,056
Mrs. Adams, I've
been sharing some of

1300
01:19:19,057 --> 01:19:22,157
Jack's criminal record
with your husband.

1301
01:19:22,189 --> 01:19:23,557
-Criminal record!
-Criminal record?

1302
01:19:23,591 --> 01:19:25,794
We're lucky
we found her in time,

1303
01:19:25,827 --> 01:19:27,863
otherwise she could have done some
serious harm to your daughter.

1304
01:19:29,095 --> 01:19:30,564
Harm?

1305
01:19:30,597 --> 01:19:33,467
-All I did was help them...
-You think this is a joke?

1306
01:19:33,501 --> 01:19:35,503
This is our family!
Glory is part of our family...

1307
01:19:35,536 --> 01:19:38,405
-It's not like what she says.
-She says you're 18!

1308
01:19:38,439 --> 01:19:40,141
She never graduated
from high school.

1309
01:19:40,173 --> 01:19:42,143
But her credentials! I...

1310
01:19:42,176 --> 01:19:43,878
I check... I checked
her references, remember...

1311
01:19:43,911 --> 01:19:47,215
You checked
Donna Graham's references.

1312
01:19:47,247 --> 01:19:49,349
This isn't Donna Graham.

1313
01:19:49,382 --> 01:19:52,252
Misrepresenting your identity,
it's called Fraud.

1314
01:19:52,286 --> 01:19:55,190
No, I did the job! Okay!

1315
01:19:55,222 --> 01:19:58,326
You need to look for missing
checks and also credit cards.

1316
01:19:58,359 --> 01:20:00,161
What, you mean like this?

1317
01:20:00,194 --> 01:20:01,830
That... That was just
an old check.

1318
01:20:01,863 --> 01:20:03,331
Then what the hell is it doing
in your room? For what?

1319
01:20:03,363 --> 01:20:05,833
I didn't use it!
I didn't use it for anything.

1320
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:09,204
-I swear to God, I didn't do anything!
-You lied?

1321
01:20:09,237 --> 01:20:11,506
-You're not even a therapist?
-No.

1322
01:20:11,538 --> 01:20:12,840
The part about
my sister is true!

1323
01:20:12,873 --> 01:20:14,842
You're not a caretaker...

1324
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,912
The whole daycare,
everything was a lie?

1325
01:20:19,613 --> 01:20:20,915
I'm sorry.

1326
01:20:23,885 --> 01:20:26,387
I just... I needed to get
a job because I need

1327
01:20:26,420 --> 01:20:27,521
to get custody of
my sister, that's all.

1328
01:20:28,989 --> 01:20:30,891
What sister?

1329
01:20:30,925 --> 01:20:33,829
Well, fortunately, her sister has
been placed with a foster family.

1330
01:20:35,262 --> 01:20:36,363
No!

1331
01:20:50,344 --> 01:20:52,279
No! No! No!

1332
01:20:54,314 --> 01:20:56,550
No. No. No...

1333
01:21:00,154 --> 01:21:02,557
-Glory.
-No. No.

1334
01:21:04,992 --> 01:21:07,262
Glory! You can't
stay with me, Glory.

1335
01:21:07,295 --> 01:21:09,430
-Glory. Come on.
-No!

1336
01:21:09,462 --> 01:21:11,231
You played us!

1337
01:21:11,265 --> 01:21:13,034
I didn't mean to...

1338
01:21:13,067 --> 01:21:14,636
Robert, what about
her interview?

1339
01:21:14,668 --> 01:21:17,438
-You can drop the act, all right!
-No! No!

1340
01:21:40,661 --> 01:21:43,698
So what would you
put in the Big Dipper?

1341
01:21:43,730 --> 01:21:45,599
In the Big Dipper...

1342
01:21:45,632 --> 01:21:49,938
I'd put... Tequila!

1343
01:21:49,970 --> 01:21:52,940
Tequila. Really.

1344
01:21:52,974 --> 01:21:55,610
Well, we better have lots of salt
and lime in the Little Dipper.

1345
01:21:55,643 --> 01:21:57,345
What would you put
in the Big Dipper, Tina?

1346
01:21:57,377 --> 01:21:59,212
Let's see,
what do I like that much?

1347
01:21:59,246 --> 01:22:01,516
Coffee!

1348
01:22:01,548 --> 01:22:04,418
Then the Little Dipper
better be full of cream!..

1349
01:22:06,287 --> 01:22:08,990
Speaking of which,
let me go grab my coffee!

1350
01:22:09,990 --> 01:22:11,025
I'll be right back.

1351
01:22:20,134 --> 01:22:21,970
My God! Jack!

1352
01:22:22,002 --> 01:22:25,206
-Hey. Hey.
-Hey!

1353
01:22:25,238 --> 01:22:27,341
They wouldn't let me e-mail! But
I knew you'd find me! -It's okay.

1354
01:22:27,375 --> 01:22:28,725
I'll grab my stuff
and come to the back...

1355
01:22:28,726 --> 01:22:29,176
Wait, wait.

1356
01:22:29,210 --> 01:22:31,445
Worst part, best part.
Worst part?

1357
01:22:31,479 --> 01:22:34,582
These assholes make me
take vitamins at every...

1358
01:22:34,614 --> 01:22:37,684
Hey. That's good!
That's what good assholes do.

1359
01:22:37,717 --> 01:22:39,554
Best part?

1360
01:22:39,587 --> 01:22:41,156
Premium channels!

1361
01:22:41,721 --> 01:22:43,657
They seem nice.

1362
01:22:43,690 --> 01:22:46,293
And there are good
schools around here.

1363
01:22:46,327 --> 01:22:48,663
-School is bullshit!
-No.

1364
01:22:48,695 --> 01:22:51,698
No, I only said that 'cause of me...
'Cause I was full of shit.

1365
01:22:51,731 --> 01:22:54,301
But you're good at school.

1366
01:22:54,335 --> 01:22:57,505
Look, Coke, I'm not
taking you with me.

1367
01:22:58,671 --> 01:23:00,273
But U.2.T.C.!

1368
01:23:00,306 --> 01:23:02,042
-I know, Coke.
-U.2.T.C.!

1369
01:23:02,076 --> 01:23:04,311
Coke, this is taking
care of you, okay.

1370
01:23:06,546 --> 01:23:08,382
Didn't you
get us a place?

1371
01:23:10,083 --> 01:23:11,219
No.

1372
01:23:12,286 --> 01:23:13,320
No, I didn't.

1373
01:23:13,354 --> 01:23:14,456
I'm sorry.

1374
01:23:16,423 --> 01:23:18,326
You'll stay here. Okay.

1375
01:23:20,094 --> 01:23:24,131
Okay, and they'll let us
keep in touch.

1376
01:23:24,164 --> 01:23:27,335
Yeah. And you can tell me all
about what you're learning.

1377
01:23:27,368 --> 01:23:29,404
What fun you're having.

1378
01:23:29,436 --> 01:23:31,038
-How many friends you're making.
-No! No!

1379
01:23:31,072 --> 01:23:31,706
Hey, it'll be good.

1380
01:23:33,073 --> 01:23:35,275
No, please, Please!

1381
01:23:35,309 --> 01:23:38,179
Please.

1382
01:23:38,212 --> 01:23:40,248
Jack,
take me with you!

1383
01:23:40,280 --> 01:23:43,216
Please just take me...

1384
01:23:43,250 --> 01:23:46,587
Please take me.
Take me.

1385
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:50,324
Jack!

1386
01:24:48,615 --> 01:24:50,451
Go, go, go.
Shake this.

1387
01:24:50,484 --> 01:24:51,319
There you go.
There you go.

1388
01:24:57,457 --> 01:25:02,729
Shit, yo,
my girl is back!

1389
01:25:05,431 --> 01:25:07,501
Come dance, girl. Come and dance.
Come and dance.

1390
01:25:07,534 --> 01:25:08,702
Come. Come.

1391
01:25:51,478 --> 01:25:52,913
No, Glory! Glory!

1392
01:25:52,947 --> 01:25:54,715
-I'll pick it up.
-Just... I'll pick it up.

1393
01:25:54,747 --> 01:25:57,951
Glory. Okay. -I'll get the...
I'll just get the theratube.

1394
01:25:57,984 --> 01:25:59,886
You know what, Mark,
let's just cancel it, okay?

1395
01:25:59,920 --> 01:26:00,788
-This is not going to work!
-Cancel?

1396
01:26:00,820 --> 01:26:02,622
But she can really do this!

1397
01:26:02,655 --> 01:26:04,591
What kind of flipping impression do
you think she's going to make now?

1398
01:26:04,625 --> 01:26:05,926
She's gonna do this.
We're gonna do this.

1399
01:26:05,960 --> 01:26:07,795
This is gonna be okay.

1400
01:26:07,828 --> 01:26:09,531
She's gonna be okay,
I promise.

1401
01:26:14,301 --> 01:26:15,903
Kay? Mark?

1402
01:26:15,935 --> 01:26:17,604
Hi! -Welcome to the
Exceptional Academy.

1403
01:26:17,637 --> 01:26:19,472
-I'm Doctor Molina.
-Hi.

1404
01:26:19,506 --> 01:26:21,409
This is Cynthia,
the psychologist

1405
01:26:21,442 --> 01:26:23,277
-who will be working with Glory today.
-So nice to meet you.

1406
01:26:23,310 --> 01:26:24,345
-Nice to meet you. Pleasure.
-This must be Glory.

1407
01:26:24,377 --> 01:26:25,979
-This is Glory.
-Hi, Glory.

1408
01:26:26,012 --> 01:26:27,881
Glory, go ahead.
Say hi.

1409
01:26:27,914 --> 01:26:29,417
-Welcome to our...
-No!

1410
01:26:29,449 --> 01:26:31,685
-No! No!
-Sorry! It's okay, sweetie.

1411
01:26:31,719 --> 01:26:34,288
She... Yeah, she's a little
overwhelmed right now.

1412
01:26:34,320 --> 01:26:35,722
-I'm sorry. There's so much going on.
-That's all right.

1413
01:26:35,756 --> 01:26:37,490
Why don't we
all go together?

1414
01:26:37,524 --> 01:26:38,893
That would be great. -That
would be great. Thank you.

1415
01:26:38,926 --> 01:26:40,562
Come on.
You can come. Let's go

1416
01:26:42,262 --> 01:26:43,296
It's okay.

1417
01:26:48,002 --> 01:26:50,004
Who else is calling you?
I'm right here.

1418
01:26:50,037 --> 01:26:50,972
Dude, it's her.

1419
01:26:51,939 --> 01:26:52,907
Dude.

1420
01:26:53,873 --> 01:26:54,675
Hello?

1421
01:26:55,509 --> 01:26:57,011
Dudley?

1422
01:26:57,043 --> 01:26:59,846
I got to
make this quick.

1423
01:26:59,880 --> 01:27:02,516
I think the cops are here,
but just...

1424
01:27:02,548 --> 01:27:04,719
Just tell Robert that,
that I need one more favor

1425
01:27:04,752 --> 01:27:08,823
and I'll never ask for anything
ever again, okay? Please?

1426
01:27:08,855 --> 01:27:10,557
<i>Yeah. Screw him.
I'll... I'll do it.</i>

1427
01:27:14,360 --> 01:27:16,796
You idiot! I'm the one that
told the cops she'd be there!

1428
01:27:16,829 --> 01:27:18,599
And I'm the idiot?

1429
01:27:21,902 --> 01:27:22,936
What's your name?

1430
01:27:28,375 --> 01:27:29,743
My name's Cynthia.

1431
01:27:32,011 --> 01:27:33,780
Can you say "Hi, Cynthia"?

1432
01:27:35,649 --> 01:27:36,817
Glory, Glory, you
can say "Hi Cynt..."

1433
01:27:36,850 --> 01:27:38,353
-Kay.
-Kay, Kay. Just...

1434
01:27:41,421 --> 01:27:42,623
-Just let her be.
-Okay.

1435
01:27:53,734 --> 01:27:56,370
Hey, Officers, wait, I'm not
armed, don't pepper spray me!

1436
01:27:56,403 --> 01:27:57,938
How you guys doing?

1437
01:27:57,970 --> 01:27:58,871
We're doing fine.
What can we do for you?

1438
01:27:58,905 --> 01:28:00,841
My name is Dudley.
Pleasure to meet you.

1439
01:28:00,873 --> 01:28:02,376
This is a new situation?

1440
01:28:05,679 --> 01:28:06,980
...Uncomfortable
and scary.

1441
01:28:10,016 --> 01:28:12,287
Come on.
Now go do your thing.

1442
01:28:14,854 --> 01:28:16,323
No.

1443
01:28:18,057 --> 01:28:20,728
No! No! No!

1444
01:28:20,761 --> 01:28:24,031
We just want to try to do this
test with everyone the same.

1445
01:28:24,064 --> 01:28:25,533
Okay. Right. You know,
with all the kids...

1446
01:28:25,565 --> 01:28:27,635
But every child
is not the same.

1447
01:28:27,667 --> 01:28:28,969
-I'm sorry, who are you?
-She's...

1448
01:28:29,002 --> 01:28:30,738
Hey, wait, could you just...

1449
01:28:30,770 --> 01:28:32,539
-Can you give us one moment?
-What do you mean?

1450
01:28:32,573 --> 01:28:33,908
Just give me one...
One second, please.

1451
01:28:33,940 --> 01:28:36,443
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
It's okay. Glory. Glory.

1452
01:28:39,613 --> 01:28:41,382
What... What exactly
are you doing?

1453
01:28:41,414 --> 01:28:43,417
Kay, I'm helping.

1454
01:28:43,449 --> 01:28:45,385
-You're helping?
-Yeah.

1455
01:28:45,418 --> 01:28:48,788
Right, like you've been doing
in my house with my daughter!

1456
01:28:48,822 --> 01:28:50,423
-With my son!
-Listen.

1457
01:28:50,457 --> 01:28:51,959
-I know...
-No, you don't!

1458
01:28:51,992 --> 01:28:54,895
No, you don't!
You have no idea!

1459
01:28:54,927 --> 01:28:57,398
Everything you told me
was a lie!

1460
01:28:57,430 --> 01:28:59,065
It wasn't all a lie. I swear.

1461
01:28:59,099 --> 01:29:01,569
Just... Just the part that
got me hired. Just that part.

1462
01:29:01,601 --> 01:29:03,804
Okay.
Just that part?

1463
01:29:03,837 --> 01:29:05,139
And I'm turning myself in right
after this, but please...

1464
01:29:05,171 --> 01:29:06,773
My God.

1465
01:29:06,806 --> 01:29:08,542
And I'll get
my GED in jail.

1466
01:29:11,511 --> 01:29:14,514
You don't just tell little fibs,
your lies are extraordinary!

1467
01:29:15,783 --> 01:29:17,952
Why should I believe
anything you tell me?

1468
01:29:20,487 --> 01:29:22,523
Because the cops
are here for me.

1469
01:29:22,555 --> 01:29:23,523
Right.

1470
01:29:26,059 --> 01:29:28,563
But first, will you please
just let me try this?

1471
01:29:42,109 --> 01:29:45,613
Hi, I'm Jack. Glory's companion.
Look, she...

1472
01:29:45,645 --> 01:29:47,514
I just have some things
in the bag for her, so...

1473
01:29:47,547 --> 01:29:48,615
-Yeah.
-Is that okay?

1474
01:29:48,649 --> 01:29:49,784
-I think that's okay.
-Yeah, sure.

1475
01:29:49,817 --> 01:29:52,420
All right.
Hey, Glory.

1476
01:29:52,453 --> 01:29:54,489
Hey, girlie.
How's it going?

1477
01:29:55,922 --> 01:29:58,525
Hey. You missed me?

1478
01:30:03,095 --> 01:30:04,097
Hey.

1479
01:30:05,765 --> 01:30:07,434
-Glory.
-No! No!

1480
01:30:07,467 --> 01:30:09,036
-See?
-Glory. Glory.

1481
01:30:09,069 --> 01:30:10,838
Hey. It's okay.

1482
01:30:10,871 --> 01:30:13,807
Glory. Sit. Sit.

1483
01:30:13,841 --> 01:30:16,110
Stay, Glory. Just stay.

1484
01:30:16,143 --> 01:30:19,012
Glory, look what
I got for you.

1485
01:30:19,046 --> 01:30:21,615
Look, it's Hippo.
Hey, Hippo.

1486
01:30:21,648 --> 01:30:24,185
Yeah. Yeah.

1487
01:30:24,217 --> 01:30:26,987
All right, okay, let's
get you some headphones.

1488
01:30:27,020 --> 01:30:28,589
Here you go.

1489
01:30:28,622 --> 01:30:30,990
We got princess
glasses, right?

1490
01:30:31,024 --> 01:30:32,193
Yeah, that's good.

1491
01:30:33,193 --> 01:30:35,930
Up. Up, Glory. Up.

1492
01:30:35,962 --> 01:30:37,230
Good girl.

1493
01:30:37,264 --> 01:30:40,067
Up. Up.

1494
01:30:40,100 --> 01:30:43,003
Good girl. -What are you
hoping to do with this?

1495
01:30:43,036 --> 01:30:46,841
Being up high, it helps her
like sensory gratiation issues.

1496
01:30:46,873 --> 01:30:48,141
Makes her smarter.

1497
01:30:48,175 --> 01:30:51,177
You mean sensory
integration issues?

1498
01:30:51,211 --> 01:30:54,014
Yeah.
That's what I said.

1499
01:30:54,046 --> 01:30:58,585
Yeah. Actually, the Miller Method out
of Boston helps with comprehension.

1500
01:31:00,520 --> 01:31:03,490
Glory. Glory, sit.

1501
01:31:03,524 --> 01:31:04,926
Sit, Glory. Sit.

1502
01:31:05,993 --> 01:31:08,796
Good girl.
Good job. Okay.

1503
01:31:08,828 --> 01:31:10,997
Now, give red
to the lady.

1504
01:31:11,030 --> 01:31:13,132
Give red to that lady.

1505
01:31:13,166 --> 01:31:16,103
Give a red block
to that lady.

1506
01:31:16,136 --> 01:31:17,638
All right?

1507
01:31:18,204 --> 01:31:19,506
Red.

1508
01:31:21,908 --> 01:31:23,844
Yeah.

1509
01:31:23,877 --> 01:31:26,747
The signs you're using,
they're not ASL.

1510
01:31:26,779 --> 01:31:31,585
No. I, I just picked them
up working with, K-9 units.

1511
01:31:31,618 --> 01:31:34,788
Actually, it was just,
it was just one guard dog.

1512
01:31:34,820 --> 01:31:36,189
The rest of the signs I...

1513
01:31:36,222 --> 01:31:37,591
I just made up.

1514
01:31:41,094 --> 01:31:42,596
You know,
I'd like to try something.

1515
01:31:45,332 --> 01:31:46,667
What color are these?

1516
01:31:48,935 --> 01:31:50,770
Shoes.

1517
01:31:50,804 --> 01:31:52,672
What color are the shoes?

1518
01:31:52,706 --> 01:31:54,542
What color
are the shoes, Glory?

1519
01:31:58,779 --> 01:32:00,114
Red!

1520
01:32:00,146 --> 01:32:01,916
Good job, girlie.

1521
01:32:01,948 --> 01:32:03,817
Red! Red! -They are red shoes.
They're red shoes.

1522
01:32:03,850 --> 01:32:06,621
Now, can you put
the bear's shoes on?

1523
01:32:13,659 --> 01:32:15,296
No.

1524
01:32:15,328 --> 01:32:18,965
No. Put the shoes
on the bear, Glory.

1525
01:32:18,998 --> 01:32:21,001
The bear. Yeah.
Shoes on the bear.

1526
01:32:22,703 --> 01:32:24,338
-Yeah.
-That's right.

1527
01:32:24,371 --> 01:32:26,007
-Yeah. Good job.
-One shoe on.

1528
01:32:27,673 --> 01:32:29,277
That's two shoes on.
Great job!

1529
01:32:33,180 --> 01:32:34,882
-Squishy!
-My God.

1530
01:32:34,914 --> 01:32:36,817
-Squishy!
-Yeah!

1531
01:32:36,850 --> 01:32:38,052
Squishy! Squishy!

1532
01:32:38,085 --> 01:32:39,286
We do that at home.

1533
01:32:39,319 --> 01:32:40,621
-With her.
-Roll her up.

1534
01:32:40,654 --> 01:32:42,990
She loves it.

1535
01:32:43,023 --> 01:32:45,826
-Pretend to play. That's good.
-Squishy.

1536
01:32:45,859 --> 01:32:48,629
Does the bear
have a name, Glory?

1537
01:32:48,662 --> 01:32:51,798
Actually, she's... She's
really good at her numbers.

1538
01:32:51,832 --> 01:32:54,001
So, yeah,
we'll work on her numbers.

1539
01:32:54,033 --> 01:32:55,969
Glory, get your
cards out, okay?

1540
01:32:56,002 --> 01:32:58,038
Can you find your cards?
Find your cards.

1541
01:32:59,171 --> 01:33:01,007
Good girl.

1542
01:33:01,041 --> 01:33:03,844
Glory, what
number is that?

1543
01:33:06,880 --> 01:33:07,748
Seven.

1544
01:33:07,780 --> 01:33:09,817
That's right.
That is a seven.

1545
01:33:09,850 --> 01:33:12,319
Look what I got.
I got jelly beans. No.

1546
01:33:12,351 --> 01:33:16,923
Okay, I want you to give
a jelly bean to that lady.

1547
01:33:16,957 --> 01:33:19,927
That lady. Tutti frutti
to that lady. Right there.

1548
01:33:30,936 --> 01:33:33,172
Thank you, Glory.
Thank you.

1549
01:33:33,206 --> 01:33:35,842
Tutti frutti

1550
01:33:35,876 --> 01:33:39,980
I want jelly belly
jelly bean please.

1551
01:33:40,012 --> 01:33:43,951
Okay, all right.
Just, ask the lady.

1552
01:33:43,984 --> 01:33:46,020
Can you ask the lady?
Ask the lady.

1553
01:33:54,728 --> 01:33:59,867
May I have a jelly belly
jelly bean please?

1554
01:33:59,899 --> 01:34:01,434
-Yeah.
-Yes you may, Glory.

1555
01:34:01,467 --> 01:34:03,436
Nice asking.

1556
01:34:03,470 --> 01:34:05,706
-That's nice asking.
-Very nice.

1557
01:34:11,411 --> 01:34:12,779
My favorite!

1558
01:34:18,385 --> 01:34:20,887
So Kay and Mark, it was
nice meeting you. -Same.

1559
01:34:20,921 --> 01:34:23,423
We'll let you know
either way.

1560
01:34:23,457 --> 01:34:27,427
And I'm really confident that you
have a wonderful support system.

1561
01:34:29,362 --> 01:34:31,364
-So...
-No. Wait.

1562
01:34:31,398 --> 01:34:34,301
You gotta to know, there
is no support system here.

1563
01:34:34,333 --> 01:34:36,302
I can't stay.

1564
01:34:36,336 --> 01:34:37,838
I can't help anymore.

1565
01:34:38,971 --> 01:34:40,306
And...

1566
01:34:40,340 --> 01:34:41,676
But I did help...

1567
01:34:43,777 --> 01:34:44,744
Right?

1568
01:34:46,345 --> 01:34:49,315
It's... It's true...

1569
01:34:49,349 --> 01:34:51,318
Glory is losing her
one on one, and...

1570
01:34:52,385 --> 01:34:53,421
They...

1571
01:34:55,756 --> 01:34:57,458
They... They made strides.

1572
01:35:01,927 --> 01:35:06,466
She can be a lot more than she
is if you give her a chance.

1573
01:35:06,500 --> 01:35:09,502
If Glory isn't enrolled
in your school this fall,

1574
01:35:09,536 --> 01:35:11,171
do you wanna be wondering
a year from now

1575
01:35:11,203 --> 01:35:12,806
what happened
to this little girl?

1576
01:35:14,940 --> 01:35:16,844
Don't you wanna make
a difference in her life?

1577
01:35:18,011 --> 01:35:18,946
Yes, I do.

1578
01:35:22,983 --> 01:35:25,485
I'm sorry. I don't mean
to be rude...

1579
01:35:26,485 --> 01:35:27,387
Is that a "yes"?

1580
01:35:30,157 --> 01:35:31,726
We're going to do
everything we can.

1581
01:35:32,292 --> 01:35:34,128
We really are.

1582
01:35:34,161 --> 01:35:36,363
We're going to do
everything we can for you.

1583
01:35:36,395 --> 01:35:37,018
Thank you so much.

1584
01:35:37,019 --> 01:35:38,264
Thank you very much.
Really, thank you.

1585
01:35:38,297 --> 01:35:40,501
-We... We really appreciate that.
-Yeah, we do.

1586
01:35:40,533 --> 01:35:41,902
-It means a lot to us.
-Yeah.

1587
01:35:45,939 --> 01:35:48,476
It looks good. They loved her.
It looks good.

1588
01:35:49,509 --> 01:35:51,177
Easy peasy, right, girlie?

1589
01:35:54,280 --> 01:35:55,750
Can I have a minute?

1590
01:36:00,319 --> 01:36:03,023
So, "Hi Jack,"

1591
01:36:06,493 --> 01:36:08,162
I guess she knew
more than all of us.

1592
01:36:11,163 --> 01:36:13,533
I... I did like you.

1593
01:36:15,202 --> 01:36:16,302
That part wasn't a lie.

1594
01:36:18,872 --> 01:36:21,542
Hey, maybe you can, help me out
with my homework sometime?

1595
01:36:23,342 --> 01:36:24,444
Yeah, maybe.

1596
01:36:26,011 --> 01:36:27,280
All right, let's go.

1597
01:36:27,314 --> 01:36:28,849
Can you give us
a moment, please?

1598
01:36:30,317 --> 01:36:32,252
I'm really sorry
I lied...

1599
01:36:34,020 --> 01:36:35,355
Hey.

1600
01:36:35,387 --> 01:36:37,291
Hey, what do
you want, Glory?

1601
01:36:39,391 --> 01:36:40,560
What do you want?

1602
01:36:42,028 --> 01:36:43,030
Say it.

1603
01:36:44,064 --> 01:36:45,032
Say it.

1604
01:36:46,867 --> 01:36:47,568
Stay.

1605
01:36:52,137 --> 01:36:53,474
You did it, girlie.

1606
01:36:54,506 --> 01:36:55,408
Yeah.

1607
01:36:56,309 --> 01:36:58,244
I can't stay. I'm sorry.

1608
01:37:07,253 --> 01:37:08,389
Thank you.

1609
01:37:11,358 --> 01:37:13,894
Be good.

1610
01:37:13,926 --> 01:37:16,996
We're gonna help you.
It's gonna be okay. -Okay.

1611
01:37:20,132 --> 01:37:22,435
All right,
Miss Jacquelyn.

1612
01:37:22,469 --> 01:37:26,907
We'll take you down to the station
and I'll meet you there later.

1613
01:37:26,939 --> 01:37:30,543
They help you out like she said and
you'll see your sister soon enough.

1614
01:37:30,577 --> 01:37:32,213
You take care
of this one.
