1
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:26,033
All right, like I said before, I wouldn't make
you pussies do anything I wouldn't do first.

2
00:01:28,520 --> 00:01:29,999
Fuck.

3
00:01:34,640 --> 00:01:36,517
Jesus. Fuck!

4
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,198
No fuckin' way.

5
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,033
Get me out of here! Go, go, go!

6
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,317
- What the hell's wrong with you?
- Nothing. Here, you're next.

7
00:01:54,360 --> 00:01:57,272
No. No one said anything about
robbing a fucking convenience store.

8
00:01:57,320 --> 00:01:59,880
Nobody said anything about anything.
Who gives a fuck? In or out.

9
00:02:02,040 --> 00:02:05,077
Go in and get $19.10
from the register. Are you ready?

10
00:02:05,120 --> 00:02:08,556
- You're serious?
- In or out, it's that fucking simple.

11
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:14,795
If you're going to be pussies about this,
we can turn around and go back.

12
00:02:18,240 --> 00:02:20,390
You've got three seconds
to get out of this van.

13
00:02:21,960 --> 00:02:24,394
- (Leader) Two, one. Come on!
- Fuck it!

14
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:29,275
- Are you fucking insane?
- We're not insane.

15
00:02:29,320 --> 00:02:32,153
- We're Sigma Zeta Chi.
- What do you say to the store clerk?

16
00:02:32,200 --> 00:02:35,556
"Excuse me, I have a gun."
After that, you don't have to say shit.

17
00:02:35,600 --> 00:02:37,192
You're next.

18
00:02:38,520 --> 00:02:39,714
If we do this, are we in?

19
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,830
- Did I say that?
- No.

20
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:44,030
- Oh, so I didn't say that?
- No.

21
00:02:44,080 --> 00:02:46,992
So don't go around saying stupid shit,
acting like a bitch.

22
00:02:47,040 --> 00:02:49,270
Bitches are for sororities,
not fraternities.

23
00:02:49,320 --> 00:02:50,719
Here he comes.

24
00:02:51,640 --> 00:02:53,073
Come on!

25
00:02:54,440 --> 00:02:57,557
- What the fuck happened?
- Holy shit! That was fucking awesome!

26
00:02:57,600 --> 00:02:59,033
- Not so bad, right?
- Fucking great!

27
00:02:59,080 --> 00:03:01,753
- What the fuck did you say to the clerk?
- Some fucking movie shit.

28
00:03:01,800 --> 00:03:04,030
"Stay there and nobody gets hurt.
Just leave the fucking money!"

29
00:03:04,080 --> 00:03:05,672
The cops have to be after us, right now!

30
00:03:05,720 --> 00:03:08,518
That's why we can't have little bitches
like you wasting our time.

31
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,278
The other pledges are doing this too?

32
00:03:10,320 --> 00:03:13,198
Yes, they're in vans, just like you,
doing the same shit we're doing.

33
00:03:13,240 --> 00:03:16,118
Cos just like you,
they wanna be Sigma Zeta Chi.

34
00:03:22,880 --> 00:03:25,474
You've come this far,
are you my brother or not?

35
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,397
Just do it, man.

36
00:03:30,160 --> 00:03:32,958
$19.10, because our fraternity
was founded in 1910.

37
00:03:33,000 --> 00:03:34,149
(Breathes deeply)

38
00:03:34,200 --> 00:03:35,679
Go get your money.

39
00:03:42,360 --> 00:03:44,157
Come on, boy, go get your money!

40
00:03:44,200 --> 00:03:45,189
(Grunts)

41
00:03:49,520 --> 00:03:51,511
- Don't say a word. Just listen.
- Scott?

42
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:54,552
Take this bag back to the van,
act like you robbed the place.

43
00:03:54,600 --> 00:03:55,828
You cool, man? Breathe.

44
00:03:55,880 --> 00:03:57,279
- This is the...
- This is it.

45
00:03:57,320 --> 00:04:00,517
- Yes, yes, I got it.
- Get the fuck out of here.

46
00:04:02,040 --> 00:04:03,712
Come on! Come on!

47
00:04:03,760 --> 00:04:08,117
- That wasn't so bad, was it?
- There wasn't even anybody in the store!

48
00:04:11,800 --> 00:04:14,758
- We slip up once, we're fucked.
- Nothing is gonna happen.

49
00:04:14,800 --> 00:04:17,519
- There wasn't anybody in the store.
- I've never even held a gun.

50
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:19,039
Hold up! Hold up, all right?

51
00:04:19,080 --> 00:04:21,230
If you want in, you gotta do this.
There's no pussying out.

52
00:04:21,280 --> 00:04:24,238
- What if I go in and there's a fucking cop?
- Not done yet, I'm not done.

53
00:04:24,280 --> 00:04:27,909
No one's gonna hold your fucking hand.
You do it or you don't.

54
00:04:27,960 --> 00:04:30,952
- Just go in there, you'll be fi...
- Uh-uh! He's a big boy.

55
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,070
You either do it or you don't.

56
00:04:44,840 --> 00:04:47,070
Brother or bitch - what's it gonna be?

57
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:49,953
Cos I know a few sororities
that are looking for members too.

58
00:04:53,920 --> 00:04:55,831
(Leader) Don't look at him, look at me.

59
00:05:00,080 --> 00:05:03,072
Can I put the mask on
right before I go in?

60
00:05:04,600 --> 00:05:06,556
Do it however you want.

61
00:05:26,520 --> 00:05:27,873
Shit!

62
00:05:27,920 --> 00:05:29,592
(AII laugh)

63
00:05:31,040 --> 00:05:32,553
(Yawns)

64
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,514
- I didn't think your boy had it in him.
- I told you, he wants in.

65
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:12,233
- Good for him, man, good for him.
- (Pants)

66
00:06:30,720 --> 00:06:33,234
Excuse me.

67
00:06:33,280 --> 00:06:35,271
Excuse me, sir.

68
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,594
Sir.

69
00:06:36,640 --> 00:06:39,438
Sir! I need all your money, now!

70
00:06:41,720 --> 00:06:42,755
No, l-l-I...

71
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:45,678
- I need $19.10 please, sir.
- (Phone ringing)

72
00:06:45,720 --> 00:06:48,109
- Yeah?
- (Scott) Are you guys almost here?

73
00:06:48,160 --> 00:06:51,596
- What you talking about? We are here.
- Is the guy out of the van yet?

74
00:06:51,640 --> 00:06:53,471
Dude, he got out, like, a minute ago.

75
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:54,953
Where the fuck are you?

76
00:06:55,000 --> 00:06:57,468
The fucking Good Luck store,
where the fuck are you?

77
00:06:57,520 --> 00:06:58,714
I'm at Good Luck.

78
00:06:58,760 --> 00:07:00,796
Please tell me you're at the store on Roslyn.

79
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:03,149
- Shit! I thought you said the other...
- Fuck!

80
00:07:05,560 --> 00:07:08,472
Give me all your fucking money, sir!

81
00:07:08,520 --> 00:07:12,274
Just give me all your money now!
Give me all your fucking money, sir!

82
00:07:12,320 --> 00:07:14,038
(Music drowns out speech)

83
00:07:15,600 --> 00:07:18,592
Give me...
Give me all your fucking money now!

84
00:07:18,640 --> 00:07:20,232
- (Gun clicks)
- Whoa!

85
00:07:20,280 --> 00:07:21,633
Holy fuck.

86
00:07:23,840 --> 00:07:26,559
- Kevin.
- What the fuck?

87
00:07:26,600 --> 00:07:28,511
- (Gunshot)
- Argh!

88
00:07:28,560 --> 00:07:30,198
(Kevin groans)

89
00:07:32,920 --> 00:07:35,309
(Firing continues)

90
00:07:35,360 --> 00:07:37,157
(Pants)

91
00:07:39,000 --> 00:07:41,833
- (Firing continues)
- (Frank) Stop shooting!

92
00:07:49,520 --> 00:07:51,078
Oh! Fuck.

93
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:53,076
It's not loaded, man! It's not loaded!

94
00:07:54,520 --> 00:07:57,637
What the fuck, Frank?!
Why's it not fucking loaded?

95
00:07:57,680 --> 00:07:59,796
Argh!

96
00:08:02,440 --> 00:08:04,715
(Kevin groans and screams)

97
00:08:04,760 --> 00:08:05,954
(Whispers) Shut up.

98
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:09,356
(Kevin whimpers, cries out)

99
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,709
Let's look. Fuck.

100
00:08:11,760 --> 00:08:13,716
- (Gunshot)
- Fuck!

101
00:08:13,760 --> 00:08:15,716
(Gunshot)

102
00:08:15,760 --> 00:08:19,116
Stop shooting, man!
Stop shooting!

103
00:08:19,160 --> 00:08:21,754
It's just a fucking prank!

104
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,552
(Whispers) Fuck.

105
00:08:23,600 --> 00:08:25,033
(Pants)

106
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:27,799
- Oh, my God!
- Frank, just get me outta here.

107
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:30,115
- Hold on. Hold on.
- OK?

108
00:08:31,640 --> 00:08:33,870
Where the fuck are you going?
Frank!

109
00:08:40,560 --> 00:08:41,959
(Firing continues)

110
00:08:43,040 --> 00:08:44,393
(Kevin groans)

111
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:48,389
- We're not really robbing you!
- Bullshit, you're not!

112
00:08:48,440 --> 00:08:51,477
I swear to fucking Christ,
we're not robbing you, let us go!

113
00:08:51,520 --> 00:08:54,273
Yeah, OK, I'll let you go.
You can go right now.

114
00:08:54,320 --> 00:08:56,709
Go ahead and walk out.

115
00:09:06,440 --> 00:09:08,795
- Fuck.
- (Yells)

116
00:09:15,200 --> 00:09:17,475
You fucking piece of shit.

117
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:19,674
He's had enough!

118
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,356
(Panting)

119
00:09:26,440 --> 00:09:28,431
(Mouths)

120
00:09:38,600 --> 00:09:39,589
Oh, fuck.

121
00:09:39,640 --> 00:09:41,915
(Groans)

122
00:09:41,960 --> 00:09:43,313
Mike?

123
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,912
- Adam?
- You fucking work here?

124
00:09:50,840 --> 00:09:52,956
Why the fuck did you rob my store?

125
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:55,116
We weren't robbing you,
it's just a fraternity thing.

126
00:09:55,160 --> 00:09:57,628
Why the fuck did your fraternity
rob my store?

127
00:09:57,680 --> 00:09:59,193
You know this guy?

128
00:09:59,240 --> 00:10:00,958
I went to high school with him.

129
00:10:03,120 --> 00:10:04,712
(Toilet flushing)

130
00:10:06,800 --> 00:10:09,189
- Oh, fuck.
- Go!

131
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:21,549
I'm sorry to keep you,
I didn't realise you were closing up.

132
00:10:22,960 --> 00:10:24,632
It's fine.

133
00:10:24,680 --> 00:10:28,309
Sounded like the Fourth of July out here.
You having a party?

134
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,680
- The breaker box blew out.
- The what?

135
00:10:32,840 --> 00:10:36,958
- The breaker box. The noise.
- No, I don't want any toys, just the gas.

136
00:10:37,000 --> 00:10:39,195
How much do I owe you?

137
00:10:39,240 --> 00:10:42,596
Er, it's on me, don't worry about it.

138
00:10:42,640 --> 00:10:44,915
Oh, no, no, I can't...
I can't do that.

139
00:10:44,960 --> 00:10:46,075
Here. Here you go.

140
00:10:48,160 --> 00:10:50,355
Thanks. Thank you.
Have a good one.

141
00:10:51,880 --> 00:10:55,156
Excuse me, I just gave you a $20 bill.

142
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,589
For three gallons of gas?
That's kinda steep.

143
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:04,274
(Adam) Oh, erm...

144
00:11:04,320 --> 00:11:08,791
Uh, how does...
How does ten sound, is that...

145
00:11:08,840 --> 00:11:11,115
- About right.
- Yeah.

146
00:11:11,160 --> 00:11:12,912
(Adam) OK.

147
00:11:12,960 --> 00:11:14,632
Here you go.

148
00:11:14,680 --> 00:11:17,831
I thought I saw a leak back there.
Want me to show it to you?

149
00:11:17,880 --> 00:11:21,668
No! No, no.
I want to get outta here.

150
00:11:21,720 --> 00:11:23,438
I really want to leave.

151
00:11:23,480 --> 00:11:25,789
OK, I'll get out of your hair.

152
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,668
(Bells jingle, door closes)

153
00:11:29,720 --> 00:11:31,472
Adam!

154
00:11:32,520 --> 00:11:33,873
(Kevin) Adam!

155
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,193
- Adam!
- (Frank) Oh, shit!

156
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:43,109
(Adam) Kevin. Oh, my God!
OK, come on, come on. You're doing fine.

157
00:11:43,160 --> 00:11:45,720
Is there a back door?
Is there a back door?!

158
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:48,274
- Yeah.
- (Frank) Well, where is it?

159
00:11:48,320 --> 00:11:49,912
It's in the fucking back.

160
00:11:49,960 --> 00:11:51,996
- (Kevin sobs)
- (Adam) I'm sorry.

161
00:11:52,040 --> 00:11:53,996
- Get the door, Adam!
- Ow! Ow!

162
00:11:54,040 --> 00:11:56,235
(Kevin groans)

163
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:02,078
(Frank) Come on, come on,
come on, come on!

164
00:12:02,120 --> 00:12:03,872
- What the fuck is this?
- Let's just go!

165
00:12:03,920 --> 00:12:07,833
- Where's the nearest hospital?
- We can't take him to the hospital.

166
00:12:07,880 --> 00:12:09,757
What are you talking about?

167
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:31,590
(On stereo:? Tech N9ne: Let's Go)

168
00:12:32,920 --> 00:12:35,514
(Boy) Right this way, ladies!
Keep it moving.

169
00:12:35,560 --> 00:12:37,710
Come on, ladies. Step in, step in.
Whoa.

170
00:12:37,760 --> 00:12:39,193
Are you ladies freshmen?

171
00:12:39,240 --> 00:12:41,037
- Yes.
- Here you go.

172
00:12:41,080 --> 00:12:44,470
- What's this?
- This is so nobody gets confused.

173
00:12:44,520 --> 00:12:46,078
- All right.
- Right this way.

174
00:12:46,120 --> 00:12:48,759
Keep it moving, keep it moving.
Step right up.

175
00:12:50,280 --> 00:12:52,077
Have you read this?

176
00:12:54,480 --> 00:12:55,515
No.

177
00:12:56,520 --> 00:12:58,351
Do you want to come sit next to me?

178
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,591
OK.

179
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,351
?...when I produced a licence
? Let's go!

180
00:13:08,400 --> 00:13:10,709
? Comin' through the dough
Hella fast, never slow

181
00:13:10,760 --> 00:13:13,354
? Got the cash and the pedal to the flo'
? Let's go!

182
00:13:13,400 --> 00:13:15,994
-? If you wanna ride, let me know...?
- Yeah!

183
00:13:16,040 --> 00:13:19,032
Bluegrass, sometimes a little rap...
Hang on a sec.

184
00:13:19,080 --> 00:13:22,277
- Get the toilet seats?
- We got every one in the house.

185
00:13:23,320 --> 00:13:24,912
Awesome. Nice job, guys.

186
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,279
Get 'em inside.

187
00:13:26,320 --> 00:13:28,436
Wash your hands.

188
00:13:28,480 --> 00:13:29,595
? Squat low like a pig

189
00:13:29,640 --> 00:13:32,029
? And know this patrol
chasing whole motion nigga shit

190
00:13:32,080 --> 00:13:35,038
? And I ain't gotta decide
to proceed without a grip...?

191
00:13:35,080 --> 00:13:37,640
- Hey! Hey, you're in SZC, right?
- Yeah.

192
00:13:37,680 --> 00:13:40,513
My brother, Kevin Fayhey,
he's one of your pledges.

193
00:13:40,560 --> 00:13:43,313
- Know where he is?
- They've all got jobs, try the bar.

194
00:13:43,360 --> 00:13:44,918
OK.

195
00:13:44,960 --> 00:13:47,394
You two. Follow me, bitches.
Let's go.

196
00:13:56,400 --> 00:13:58,231
Can I put my hand between your legs?

197
00:13:58,280 --> 00:14:00,475
Yes.

198
00:14:12,600 --> 00:14:14,556
- Did you guys see her?
- She wasn't that big.

199
00:14:14,600 --> 00:14:17,751
I don't know about that one, man,
she was pretty damn big.

200
00:14:25,320 --> 00:14:27,151
Uh...
Can I make love to you?

201
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,631
(Moaning, sighing)

202
00:14:32,680 --> 00:14:35,399
? I hit that err that got that urge
to knockin' on yo do

203
00:14:35,440 --> 00:14:38,000
? Get in this car
I'm a star, you ain't noticed yet?

204
00:14:38,040 --> 00:14:40,235
? Look at these shoes
Look at these jewels shinin' on my neck

205
00:14:40,280 --> 00:14:42,794
? I spit that denim then I send 'em
in the remover denim

206
00:14:42,840 --> 00:14:45,149
? And once I get 'em
then I bend 'em and I can't remember 'em

207
00:14:45,200 --> 00:14:47,350
? I stay persistent and consistent
when it comes to pimpin

208
00:14:47,400 --> 00:14:50,039
? Your hoe gets sentenced from a sentance
when it comes to repentance

209
00:14:50,080 --> 00:14:52,469
? I go the distance when I hit your butt
like I'm the midget

210
00:14:52,520 --> 00:14:54,829
? Position touch it, position ship it
like I ain't in it

211
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,314
? The arms are touchin'
we gonna hit that

212
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,157
? I'm suckin' and bustin'...?

213
00:14:59,200 --> 00:15:00,758
- Rodeo!
- (Girl shrieks)

214
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,313
(Cheering)

215
00:15:02,360 --> 00:15:03,839
(Girl shrieks)

216
00:15:05,440 --> 00:15:07,032
(Girl) No!

217
00:15:11,560 --> 00:15:13,357
(Girl) Get outta here!

218
00:15:15,840 --> 00:15:19,116
12 seconds. Boy, that's a new record.
Now get the fuck outta here.

219
00:15:19,160 --> 00:15:21,071
Get the fuck out. Everybody out!

220
00:15:29,800 --> 00:15:33,270
Don't you ever treat a woman
like that again in this house.

221
00:15:33,320 --> 00:15:35,880
Where'd you learn that shit?
That is detestable.

222
00:15:35,920 --> 00:15:38,878
You're gonna stay in here and
finish all these before you get out.

223
00:15:38,920 --> 00:15:41,036
That's your punishment, bitch.

224
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,916
Yeah!

225
00:15:48,400 --> 00:15:50,994
- Jackson!
- Are you ready for the next group?

226
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:52,871
Come here. Get the fuck over here.

227
00:15:52,920 --> 00:15:55,718
- Is that fucking blood?
- (Kevin groans)

228
00:15:55,760 --> 00:15:59,230
Get the fuck out of my house right now!
Party's over!

229
00:15:59,280 --> 00:16:01,840
Move it! Move it now!

230
00:16:01,880 --> 00:16:06,396
If you are not in this fraternity,
then get the fuck outta here!

231
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:09,557
- Get the fuck out of my house!
- What the fuck happened to him?

232
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:12,512
(Frank) He got shot!
What does it look like? Shut up!

233
00:16:12,560 --> 00:16:15,870
We need to deal with the situation!
Make sure everybody gets out.

234
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,639
Keep a few of the guys,
no pledges, except for these two.

235
00:16:18,680 --> 00:16:21,148
Absolutely nobody
who isn't in the fraternity.

236
00:16:21,200 --> 00:16:23,794
I could just go to a hospital,
just take me to a hospital.

237
00:16:23,840 --> 00:16:26,798
Why can't we just take him
to fucking hospital?!

238
00:16:26,840 --> 00:16:30,150
I said we might, but I need to figure
this fucking shit out first!

239
00:16:30,200 --> 00:16:32,077
Get me some towels or something.

240
00:16:32,120 --> 00:16:34,680
- What if he fucking dies?
- Are you a fucking doctor?

241
00:16:34,720 --> 00:16:37,712
- Yes, I'm a goddamn doctor.
- Shut the fuck up, OK?

242
00:16:37,760 --> 00:16:41,036
Kevin's blood is at the store, OK,
there's other shit there, evidence.

243
00:16:41,080 --> 00:16:43,913
We can't take a kid
with gunshot wounds to a hospital.

244
00:16:43,960 --> 00:16:46,269
- We can't do that!
- I won't say shit, Frank.

245
00:16:46,320 --> 00:16:50,393
We cannot take you to a hospital
cos we may as well take you to jail.

246
00:16:50,440 --> 00:16:52,635
Can you hang on long enough
to stay out of jail?

247
00:16:52,680 --> 00:16:54,398
Yeah, I think so. I fucking think so.

248
00:16:54,440 --> 00:16:56,635
Tell Bean to get his ass over here now.

249
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:58,557
- Who the fuck is Bean?
- (Frank) A doctor.

250
00:16:58,600 --> 00:17:01,319
- What is he...
- He's a fucking doctor! He can help us!

251
00:17:01,360 --> 00:17:04,591
He lives down the street.
Just let me fucking figure this out.

252
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,119
(Kevin cries out in pain)

253
00:17:06,160 --> 00:17:07,991
It's Graham,
you need to get over here now!

254
00:17:09,160 --> 00:17:11,435
A dude's been shot,
just get the fuck over here.

255
00:17:11,480 --> 00:17:14,040
- Get your ass over here!
- (Girl) Oh, my God.

256
00:17:15,600 --> 00:17:18,956
- Who the fuck is that? Jackson, get her out.
- Can you leave?

257
00:17:19,000 --> 00:17:21,639
- That's disgusting.
- Get the fuck out, right now.

258
00:17:21,680 --> 00:17:24,319
I swear to God,
I'm gonna beat your fucking fat ass...

259
00:17:24,360 --> 00:17:27,352
- Fuck you!
- (Jackson) Get out right now!

260
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:30,628
It's all right, it's all right.
It's all right.

261
00:17:30,680 --> 00:17:32,796
- Oh, fuck!
- Yeah, this is your fault.

262
00:17:32,840 --> 00:17:35,877
I thought you said the other store.
Kevin, I am so sorry.

263
00:17:35,920 --> 00:17:37,638
I'll go to jail, I don't fucking care.

264
00:17:37,680 --> 00:17:40,513
- Get me in an ambulance.
- Get some painkillers or something.

265
00:17:40,560 --> 00:17:42,232
Upstairs, in my bathroom cabinet.

266
00:17:42,280 --> 00:17:44,669
Stop explaining!
You could have been back by now!

267
00:17:44,720 --> 00:17:47,075
He can get it, don't yell at me
in front of the pledges!

268
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:51,079
(Frank) Kev, we're gonna hang in for you.
(Adam) Oh, God. Fuck!

269
00:17:51,960 --> 00:17:53,109
What the fuck are you doing?

270
00:17:53,160 --> 00:17:55,549
- You want me to call an ambulance?
- Where have you been?

271
00:17:55,600 --> 00:17:57,238
No hospitals.
Where do ambulances go?

272
00:17:57,280 --> 00:17:58,315
Go get some more towels!

273
00:17:58,360 --> 00:18:01,955
Answer me!
Where the fuck do ambulances go, Adam?

274
00:18:02,000 --> 00:18:04,912
- To the fucking hospital! All right?
- There we go.

275
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,077
We're not taking you to the hospital
because we're not letting you go to jail.

276
00:18:08,120 --> 00:18:10,270
Help is on the way, all right?
Hang in there for me.

277
00:18:10,320 --> 00:18:12,231
OK, I've got the painkillers.

278
00:18:12,280 --> 00:18:13,395
Bean's here.

279
00:18:13,440 --> 00:18:15,396
Give me some water.

280
00:18:15,440 --> 00:18:17,271
(Kevin groans)

281
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:21,353
(Frank) Open up. Here it comes.
(Jackson) Go, go, go, swallow.

282
00:18:21,400 --> 00:18:23,470
(Jackson) It's all right, buddy.

283
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,476
- (Frank) Kev, look at me.
- What is this?

284
00:18:25,520 --> 00:18:27,988
Fucking get over here, get over here.

285
00:18:28,040 --> 00:18:30,793
- Look, look.
- I thought he was shot in the hand.

286
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,115
- This guy's bleeding...
- From the shoulder. Can you help?

287
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:36,709
(Coughs) Ow! Ow!

288
00:18:36,760 --> 00:18:39,513
Take him to a hospital, call an ambulance.
Why'd you bring him here?

289
00:18:39,560 --> 00:18:41,437
We wanted to figure out the best way.

290
00:18:41,480 --> 00:18:45,439
- The best way is to get him out of here.
- So you can't do anything?

291
00:18:45,480 --> 00:18:47,436
I'm a Med student.
What do you want me to do?

292
00:18:47,480 --> 00:18:49,675
- (Kevin) Fuck!
- I thought we told you to leave.

293
00:18:49,720 --> 00:18:50,994
My glasses are upstairs.

294
00:18:51,040 --> 00:18:54,271
There's something more important
than you going on right now.

295
00:18:54,320 --> 00:18:56,276
Jackson, fucking do something!

296
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,872
- Where are your glasses?
- Upstairs.

297
00:18:58,920 --> 00:19:00,114
Go outside, I'll get 'em.

298
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:01,479
(Groans)

299
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,112
What do you want me to do here?

300
00:19:03,160 --> 00:19:05,879
I don't know what I want you to do.
Fucking help us!

301
00:19:05,920 --> 00:19:08,115
I'll help you put him in a cab,
and take him to the hospital.

302
00:19:08,160 --> 00:19:11,311
I'll help you dial 911.
What are you thinking here?

303
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:13,157
Just fucking look at him.

304
00:19:13,200 --> 00:19:15,191
(Kevin cries out in pain)

305
00:19:17,480 --> 00:19:20,631
(Kevin groans in agony)

306
00:19:22,960 --> 00:19:26,509
(Kevin screams) Fuck!

307
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:30,633
What? What?! Tell me!

308
00:19:30,680 --> 00:19:33,797
Does he have enough time
for you to do anything?

309
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:36,308
- Yes or no, Bean?
- No! I'm not a doctor.

310
00:19:36,360 --> 00:19:37,554
- I don't know.
- Fuck!

311
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:39,397
Are you sure an ambulance
is not the best idea?

312
00:19:39,440 --> 00:19:42,591
Get him the fuck outta here!
Get his cellphone too.

313
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:44,437
(Adam) Are you serious?

314
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,078
I'm just trying to help!

315
00:19:57,880 --> 00:20:00,189
What's wrong with that guy in there?

316
00:20:02,400 --> 00:20:03,549
Erm...

317
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,517
What... what guy?

318
00:20:09,800 --> 00:20:12,712
(Approaching footsteps, door opens)

319
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:15,955
Hey, where are you going?

320
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:19,549
Talk to her. Take one for the team.
Keep her quiet.

321
00:20:19,600 --> 00:20:23,275
- Hey, wait up. I'm serious, wait.
- What?

322
00:20:25,360 --> 00:20:27,510
Let me take you home?
Can I walk you home?

323
00:20:29,280 --> 00:20:30,554
Come here, come here.

324
00:20:30,600 --> 00:20:32,989
I know things got fucked up tonight
and I'm sorry,

325
00:20:33,040 --> 00:20:34,951
but we don't have time
to talk through all this.

326
00:20:35,000 --> 00:20:36,752
We're gonna take Kevin to the hospital.

327
00:20:36,800 --> 00:20:38,438
(Sighs)

328
00:20:39,600 --> 00:20:40,874
Jesus Christ, thank you.

329
00:20:40,920 --> 00:20:44,071
- But I need your help, all right?
- Anything you want.

330
00:20:44,120 --> 00:20:48,796
I need you to go back to the store and get
the surveillance tape from your friend there.

331
00:20:48,840 --> 00:20:51,035
You want me to go back
to the store we just robbed?

332
00:20:51,080 --> 00:20:53,753
You knew the guy there.
I need you to get the tape.

333
00:20:53,800 --> 00:20:56,234
This way, we still have a chance.
Don't ask questions, just go.

334
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,714
If the store is clean,
we can still get out of this.

335
00:20:58,760 --> 00:21:00,830
I should be going with Kevin
to the hospital.

336
00:21:00,880 --> 00:21:03,713
- Send somebody else.
- You're the one who knew the clerk.

337
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:06,672
You want to help Kevin, but the best
way to help Kevin is to get the tape.

338
00:21:06,720 --> 00:21:09,359
If the police are there, leave.
Graham's gonna take you.

339
00:21:09,400 --> 00:21:11,994
Go now, while we still have a chance
to get out of this alive.

340
00:21:12,040 --> 00:21:13,029
And be fast.

341
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:32,391
(Dog barking)

342
00:21:36,280 --> 00:21:38,271
(Telephone rings)

343
00:21:48,960 --> 00:21:51,428
(Adam) Fuck, Mike.

344
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:52,629
Are you OK, man?

345
00:21:52,680 --> 00:21:54,079
(Ringing continues)

346
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,475
It's Adam. I'm here to help you.
You gotta get up.

347
00:21:56,520 --> 00:21:59,034
- (Mike) I'm closed, come back.
- Come on, man.

348
00:21:59,080 --> 00:22:02,516
It's Adam. Dude, I'm here
to help you. Stop, stop.

349
00:22:05,600 --> 00:22:07,272
Come on, Graham.

350
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:12,837
(Adam) I'm so sorry
about what's happened.

351
00:22:22,320 --> 00:22:23,753
You know you shot our boy Kevin?

352
00:22:24,800 --> 00:22:26,916
(Coughs) He all right?

353
00:22:26,960 --> 00:22:29,474
(Graham) He will be.
I'm sorry about what happened.

354
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:31,954
We'll be out of here when we're sure
everything's all right.

355
00:22:32,000 --> 00:22:34,036
But we need a favour.

356
00:22:34,080 --> 00:22:37,277
(Scoffs) Yeah right, man.
Whatever you want. Fuck you.

357
00:22:37,320 --> 00:22:39,436
Look, you handle this, I'll clean.

358
00:22:39,480 --> 00:22:41,072
(Adam) All right.

359
00:22:44,480 --> 00:22:46,232
Hey, listen, Mike.

360
00:22:46,280 --> 00:22:49,590
I need you to help me out on this.
We need the surveillance tape.

361
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:52,108
Surveillance tape?

362
00:22:52,160 --> 00:22:55,232
- I need you to give it to us.
- I need you to go fuck yourself.

363
00:22:55,280 --> 00:22:57,874
(Graham) Give us the tape,
we'll forget you shot someone.

364
00:22:57,920 --> 00:23:00,514
You guys tried to rob me, OK?
My conscience is clean.

365
00:23:00,560 --> 00:23:03,074
You know we didn't mean
for that to happen.

366
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:05,236
I'm asking you as a friend,
give it to us, please.

367
00:23:05,280 --> 00:23:07,840
I'm telling you as a friend,
I can't give you the tape.

368
00:23:07,880 --> 00:23:11,509
- (Graham) We'll take it ourselves.
- If the asshole will let me finish.

369
00:23:11,560 --> 00:23:14,836
I can't give you the tape,
cos we don't have one.

370
00:23:14,880 --> 00:23:16,154
(Adam) What's that?

371
00:23:16,200 --> 00:23:19,556
Look, we got that camera, we got that TV,
but that's it, OK?

372
00:23:19,600 --> 00:23:22,478
The tape recorder broke
and the owner never got it fixed.

373
00:23:22,520 --> 00:23:25,273
We just keep it there for looks.

374
00:23:25,320 --> 00:23:29,677
- So there's no record of what happened?
- No. Except that big-ass mess in there.

375
00:23:29,720 --> 00:23:32,075
- Did you hear that?
- I'm working on the mess.

376
00:23:33,960 --> 00:23:35,473
(Adam) Did you call the police?

377
00:23:35,520 --> 00:23:38,512
- I've just been laying here.
- Anyone come in?

378
00:23:38,560 --> 00:23:41,393
I don't think so, I don't know,
I've been passed out.

379
00:23:42,240 --> 00:23:45,357
- OK, are you about done in there?
- Hold on.

380
00:23:45,400 --> 00:23:47,595
No "hold on", we need to get out of here.

381
00:23:49,560 --> 00:23:52,597
- Are we good?
- Yeah.

382
00:23:52,640 --> 00:23:54,551
All right, let's get outta here.

383
00:23:55,640 --> 00:23:57,312
(Graham) Shit!

384
00:24:11,760 --> 00:24:13,273
(Hushed) Let's get outta here.

385
00:24:16,800 --> 00:24:19,075
Yeah. Held up.

386
00:24:19,120 --> 00:24:21,270
Corner of Roslyn and Woodside.

387
00:24:22,120 --> 00:24:24,793
- I don't need to stay on the line.
- What are you doing?

388
00:24:24,840 --> 00:24:26,068
You said you were leaving.

389
00:24:26,120 --> 00:24:27,838
- I called the cops.
- We still need to talk.

390
00:24:27,880 --> 00:24:31,589
We gotta get our stories on the same page.
What you gonna tell the police?

391
00:24:31,640 --> 00:24:35,269
I'll say a frat guy came with a gun,
I shot him and got my ass whipped.

392
00:24:35,320 --> 00:24:38,073
- Do you know what you're gonna say?
- I don't know, man.

393
00:24:38,120 --> 00:24:40,918
- What's with all the questions?
- What the hell do you think?

394
00:24:40,960 --> 00:24:42,757
We're trying to keep our asses
out of trouble.

395
00:24:42,800 --> 00:24:45,109
Say some thuggish dudes
came in and shot up the place.

396
00:24:45,160 --> 00:24:47,833
Thuggish dudes?
You mean some black guys, right?

397
00:24:47,880 --> 00:24:49,279
You guys are all the same.

398
00:24:49,320 --> 00:24:52,835
If you say it was black dudes
they'll never look for a white fraternity,

399
00:24:52,880 --> 00:24:54,836
so say it was two fucking black guys.

400
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,359
Your ass better step up to the plate.

401
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:59,198
- I'll step up. Whatever.
- What are you gonna say?

402
00:24:59,240 --> 00:25:01,151
You can't intimidate me,
the cops are on their way.

403
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:02,758
- Relax.
- Do I intimidate you now?

404
00:25:02,800 --> 00:25:04,836
- (Adam) Stop. Stop!
- (Police sirens)

405
00:25:04,880 --> 00:25:07,952
- Are you gonna help us? I need to know.
- You hear those sirens?

406
00:25:08,000 --> 00:25:11,595
- What are you gonna say?
- Mike, are you gonna protect us?

407
00:25:12,640 --> 00:25:14,915
Why don't you stick around and find out?

408
00:25:20,880 --> 00:25:22,757
(Car approaching)

409
00:25:27,360 --> 00:25:30,750
- So you got the tape?
- Their cameras don't work, no tape.

410
00:25:30,800 --> 00:25:32,392
- You're sure? Positive?
- (Adam) Yeah.

411
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:33,759
He said yes.

412
00:25:33,800 --> 00:25:36,234
So, that-that's great.
We're in the clear?

413
00:25:36,280 --> 00:25:38,236
(Graham sighs)

414
00:25:38,280 --> 00:25:40,271
What? What's the matter?

415
00:25:41,680 --> 00:25:44,353
- Whoa! What the fuck?
- Shit! What the fuck is this?

416
00:25:44,400 --> 00:25:46,118
- That's Mike.
- I know who the fuck it is.

417
00:25:46,160 --> 00:25:48,628
Why did you bring him here?
I told you to get the tape.

418
00:25:48,680 --> 00:25:51,319
- He is the tape, he was gonna tell the cops.
- So you took him hostage?

419
00:25:51,360 --> 00:25:55,717
We didn't have a choice, he wouldn't cover
for us. This is the only way to protect us.

420
00:25:55,760 --> 00:25:58,035
What happens when the police show up
and he's gone?

421
00:25:58,080 --> 00:26:00,036
Yeah, then what?

422
00:26:00,080 --> 00:26:01,638
(Mike groans)

423
00:26:01,680 --> 00:26:04,752
- Oh, fuck.
- We don't know this guy, all right?

424
00:26:04,800 --> 00:26:06,791
(Girls laugh)

425
00:26:06,840 --> 00:26:10,594
Help! Help, please! Over here!

426
00:26:12,040 --> 00:26:14,395
Help me, please, over here!
Somebody...

427
00:26:16,720 --> 00:26:18,472
Help!

428
00:26:18,520 --> 00:26:19,873
(Girls laugh)

429
00:26:19,920 --> 00:26:21,194
(Sobs)

430
00:26:21,240 --> 00:26:22,798
Let's just get him inside.

431
00:26:22,840 --> 00:26:26,515
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
Let's just take a deep breath.

432
00:26:26,560 --> 00:26:28,710
Do we really want to do this?

433
00:26:34,280 --> 00:26:37,875
- Get in there.
- (Mike) You didn't take him to a hospital?!

434
00:26:37,920 --> 00:26:39,353
What is he still doing here?

435
00:26:41,200 --> 00:26:42,838
- What is he still doing here?
- Relax.

436
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:45,348
You were taking him to a hospital!
I just took a hostage.

437
00:26:45,400 --> 00:26:47,595
Come here. Come here.

438
00:26:49,560 --> 00:26:52,552
Come here.
First of all, shut the fuck up!

439
00:26:52,600 --> 00:26:54,989
OK, Bean called a doctor, a real doctor.

440
00:26:55,040 --> 00:26:56,473
He's gonna be here soon.

441
00:26:56,520 --> 00:26:59,353
We didn't take him to the hospital
because we got the bleeding to stop.

442
00:26:59,400 --> 00:27:00,958
Why can't we go get him help?

443
00:27:01,000 --> 00:27:02,797
I just fucking told you!

444
00:27:02,840 --> 00:27:05,718
A doctor is on the way.
He's gonna take care of Kevin.

445
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:08,558
Why would we take Kevin to a doctor,
when a doctor's coming to us?

446
00:27:08,600 --> 00:27:10,352
It's the same thing.

447
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:12,231
This is a good move.

448
00:27:12,280 --> 00:27:14,635
Taking a hostage didn't make things easier.

449
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,830
Talk to your friend about that.

450
00:27:16,880 --> 00:27:18,552
You let him decide?

451
00:27:20,440 --> 00:27:21,919
You're a leader, Adam.

452
00:27:22,960 --> 00:27:24,473
OK, y-you...

453
00:27:24,520 --> 00:27:27,717
You're supposed to lead the guys
coming up under me, all right?

454
00:27:27,760 --> 00:27:31,116
I need you and Kevin needs you.
These other...

455
00:27:32,560 --> 00:27:34,869
(Hushed)
These other guys are fucking crazy.

456
00:27:34,920 --> 00:27:37,480
Graham? Yeah, right! And Scott?

457
00:27:37,520 --> 00:27:42,196
It's you, OK? And you're proving me right
by holding your shit together. OK?

458
00:27:42,240 --> 00:27:45,357
Kevin's gonna be fine.
Kevin's gonna be fine.

459
00:27:45,400 --> 00:27:49,029
All right? Right now, we need to figure out
a way to deal with the clerk.

460
00:27:49,080 --> 00:27:52,072
(Sighs) I'm pretty sure
he's gonna cover for us.

461
00:27:52,120 --> 00:27:54,998
In the car he said that he would tell
the cops it was two black guys.

462
00:27:55,040 --> 00:27:57,713
He was just screaming for help,
how can we make sure he'll say that?

463
00:27:57,760 --> 00:27:59,512
I think that we can trust him.

464
00:27:59,560 --> 00:28:01,596
This isn't about trust, OK?

465
00:28:01,640 --> 00:28:04,791
We can't just hope that he's gonna say
what we want him to.

466
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,717
- Graham!
- Yeah.

467
00:28:11,160 --> 00:28:13,390
- This is your job, you took the guy.
- What?

468
00:28:13,440 --> 00:28:15,158
Adam told me the clerk
will say it was two black guys.

469
00:28:15,200 --> 00:28:18,078
We need to make sure they don't turn
into two white fraternity members,

470
00:28:18,120 --> 00:28:19,314
when he talks to the police.

471
00:28:19,360 --> 00:28:22,272
- How are we gonna do that?
- We were gonna use Adam's story.

472
00:28:22,320 --> 00:28:23,958
Adam's story? What story?

473
00:28:24,000 --> 00:28:25,752
- You didn't tell him.
- Tell me what?

474
00:28:25,800 --> 00:28:29,679
- The story doesn't fucking help us.
- Will someone tell me what's going on?

475
00:28:29,720 --> 00:28:33,156
Adam knows some shit on the clerk
from high school.

476
00:28:33,200 --> 00:28:36,829
- How the fuck is that supposed to help us?
- He knows some serious shit.

477
00:28:36,880 --> 00:28:40,759
We let him know - if he tells the cops
about us, we'll tell the cops about him.

478
00:28:40,800 --> 00:28:43,678
You don't get it.
If I tell the cops what I know about him

479
00:28:43,720 --> 00:28:47,872
it's just the same shit they've heard
a million times already. It's just a rumour.

480
00:28:47,920 --> 00:28:50,354
I have no proof that's gonna force him
to keep his mouth shut.

481
00:28:50,400 --> 00:28:52,152
We need a way to prove this thing.

482
00:28:52,200 --> 00:28:54,395
- If we find proof, that's our leverage?
- Exactly.

483
00:28:54,440 --> 00:28:56,317
(Sighs) I guess.

484
00:28:57,360 --> 00:29:02,388
So what's this story of yours? How the hell
are we gonna prove this fucking thing?

485
00:29:15,680 --> 00:29:17,352
Jesus.

486
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:23,235
It was two black guys, OK?

487
00:29:23,280 --> 00:29:26,556
I'll say whatever you want.
Can I go?

488
00:29:26,600 --> 00:29:30,309
- Why couldn't you have said that earlier?
- That's what I was gonna say.

489
00:29:30,360 --> 00:29:34,148
If I'd known I was gonna get kidnapped
I would have made that shit clear.

490
00:29:35,160 --> 00:29:36,798
Adam, look, man...

491
00:29:36,840 --> 00:29:39,149
I don't want to talk to the cops, OK?

492
00:29:39,200 --> 00:29:41,316
Two black guys robbed the store.

493
00:29:41,360 --> 00:29:43,669
They came back for the tape,
kidnapped me,

494
00:29:43,720 --> 00:29:47,315
and then they dropped my ass
this side of town. OK?

495
00:29:47,360 --> 00:29:48,634
Can I go?

496
00:29:49,640 --> 00:29:50,959
You'll say that?

497
00:29:51,000 --> 00:29:53,150
- Yes.
- You promise?

498
00:29:53,200 --> 00:29:55,191
I said yes, man. Fuck!

499
00:29:55,240 --> 00:29:57,800
(Sighs) And how do I know that?

500
00:30:01,080 --> 00:30:03,833
- I guess you have to trust me.
- All of a sudden, I can trust you?

501
00:30:03,880 --> 00:30:06,997
You could trust me then,
you can trust me now.

502
00:30:10,040 --> 00:30:15,398
OK, but... keep in mind that there's
some shit that I know about you.

503
00:30:15,440 --> 00:30:17,670
Yeah, right, man. I'm sure you do.

504
00:30:17,720 --> 00:30:20,109
Some shit from high school.
It's not pretty.

505
00:30:22,240 --> 00:30:23,514
Don't play dumb.

506
00:30:25,840 --> 00:30:28,434
You know what I'm talking about,
don't you?

507
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,954
Basketball party, junior year, that girl...

508
00:30:33,480 --> 00:30:36,597
- You guys messed with her.
- No, man. That's bullshit, OK?

509
00:30:36,640 --> 00:30:39,313
You didn't mess with her?
I know for a fact you did.

510
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,396
Check your facts,
you don't know shit about me.

511
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:44,910
Listen, I don't care whether you say
you did or you didn't,

512
00:30:44,960 --> 00:30:48,077
as far as I'm concerned, you talk about us,
I have to talk about you,

513
00:30:48,120 --> 00:30:50,475
then everything that night
gets brought back up again.

514
00:30:50,520 --> 00:30:53,990
They dropped the charges, why?
Cos no one would talk.

515
00:30:54,040 --> 00:30:55,439
Until now.

516
00:30:57,720 --> 00:31:01,110
Listen,
maybe you didn't do anything wrong.

517
00:31:01,160 --> 00:31:04,948
Maybe they'll take pity on you because you
were the only one who had enough respect

518
00:31:05,000 --> 00:31:06,991
to put a condom
on that broomstick that you poked...

519
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:11,431
I said I'm not gonna tell anybody, OK?
What do you want from me?

520
00:31:11,480 --> 00:31:14,836
- So you admit it? You admit it?
- You know that's not what happened.

521
00:31:14,880 --> 00:31:16,359
Tell me what happened, Mike.

522
00:31:16,400 --> 00:31:19,790
All right, look, I was there. Fine.
I'm not disputing that.

523
00:31:19,840 --> 00:31:21,478
But that part about me...

524
00:31:21,520 --> 00:31:22,953
(Whirring and clicking)

525
00:31:23,000 --> 00:31:24,956
What's that noise?

526
00:31:25,000 --> 00:31:27,355
- Did you hear that?
- What?

527
00:31:27,400 --> 00:31:29,072
That noise, did you hear that?

528
00:31:29,120 --> 00:31:31,475
I didn't hear anything.

529
00:31:31,520 --> 00:31:34,478
- What's that noise?
- There's no noise. Tell me what you did.

530
00:31:34,520 --> 00:31:36,670
- What the fuck is in your pocket?
- Nothing.

531
00:31:36,720 --> 00:31:39,678
- Tell me what you were gonna say.
- What are you trying to do?

532
00:31:39,720 --> 00:31:42,188
What the fuck are you trying to do to me?

533
00:31:43,680 --> 00:31:48,196
Fuck you, man. I'm trying to be real
and you tape-record some bullshit on me?

534
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,630
- What can you give us?
- What the fuck do you mean?

535
00:31:51,680 --> 00:31:55,389
I'm trying to help you right now,
don't you get it? I trust you.

536
00:31:55,440 --> 00:31:57,829
But it's gonna take more
than your word to get you home.

537
00:31:57,880 --> 00:31:59,518
You need to tell me what you did.

538
00:31:59,560 --> 00:32:02,154
No one's ever gonna hear this tape,
they just want insurance.

539
00:32:02,200 --> 00:32:04,395
Then why the fuck do you need it?

540
00:32:04,440 --> 00:32:07,352
Just tell me what you did. OK?
Go.

541
00:32:07,400 --> 00:32:09,755
(Tape whirrs)

542
00:32:14,920 --> 00:32:19,357
There's a pledge bleeding upstairs.
Do you think they give a shit about you?

543
00:32:19,400 --> 00:32:20,594
Do ya?

544
00:32:25,520 --> 00:32:26,999
So now you're not talking.

545
00:32:28,000 --> 00:32:29,115
Is that it?

546
00:32:29,160 --> 00:32:32,038
You're not gonna say anything?

547
00:32:34,160 --> 00:32:37,630
You're gonna wish you'd helped me,
because I'm the nice one here.

548
00:32:37,680 --> 00:32:39,955
Now you're gonna have to deal with them.

549
00:32:40,720 --> 00:32:44,076
They brought you here for the same
reason they bring the pledges here,

550
00:32:44,120 --> 00:32:46,315
so no one can hear us scream
when we're being hazed.

551
00:32:48,960 --> 00:32:50,951
Just a little info about them.

552
00:32:54,320 --> 00:32:56,390
I know a little info about you.

553
00:32:58,520 --> 00:33:00,351
Your boy's up there, bleeding,

554
00:33:00,400 --> 00:33:04,791
and you're here trying to tape-record
some teenage gossip bullshit on me.

555
00:33:04,840 --> 00:33:06,558
That's what I know about you.

556
00:33:08,280 --> 00:33:10,157
And that's fucked-up.

557
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:24,197
- Are we good?
- It's broke.

558
00:33:24,240 --> 00:33:25,912
I use it in class all the time...

559
00:33:25,960 --> 00:33:29,111
That sound means it's broken.
It was a stupid idea, anyway.

560
00:33:29,160 --> 00:33:31,913
- Are you OK, man?
- (Slurs) I'm good.

561
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:33,393
- Fix it.
- How?

562
00:33:33,440 --> 00:33:35,510
Mike is not leaving until his story's on tape.

563
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,950
- He's not gonna confess twice, OK?
- (Bean)... Barry Avenue.

564
00:33:39,000 --> 00:33:40,911
No, no, no, not Perry. Barry.

565
00:33:40,960 --> 00:33:42,951
- Who is he talking to?
- The doctor.

566
00:33:43,000 --> 00:33:46,072
B-A-R-R...
He's lost.

567
00:33:46,120 --> 00:33:48,634
- Yeah.
- (Adam) Tell him to hurry up!

568
00:33:48,680 --> 00:33:50,875
- Shut up. There it is again.
- (Banging)

569
00:33:50,920 --> 00:33:52,273
- What?
- That noise.

570
00:33:52,320 --> 00:33:54,629
(Bean)
...then you make a left on Roosevelt...

571
00:33:54,680 --> 00:33:57,114
- Bean, shut up for a second!
- Listen, I gotta go.

572
00:33:57,160 --> 00:34:00,072
- (Banging, shattering)
- (Bean) Call me if you need to.

573
00:34:04,480 --> 00:34:05,708
- Oh, shit.
- (Frank) What?

574
00:34:05,760 --> 00:34:07,034
(Girls shout)

575
00:34:07,080 --> 00:34:09,036
- It's Kevin's sister.
- What's she doing here?

576
00:34:09,080 --> 00:34:11,594
She heard her fucking brother's
bleeding, man.

577
00:34:11,640 --> 00:34:12,789
Fuck.

578
00:34:12,840 --> 00:34:14,671
Think you can get away with this shit?

579
00:34:15,720 --> 00:34:20,191
- We gotta get Kevin upstairs now!
- Wait. No, no, no, you can't move him!

580
00:34:20,240 --> 00:34:22,879
- This is a bad idea.
- Argh!

581
00:34:22,920 --> 00:34:24,797
- Oh, shit!
- That's all me?

582
00:34:24,840 --> 00:34:27,308
Fuck! Bean!

583
00:34:27,360 --> 00:34:29,635
(Frank) Get him upstairs.
(Adam) That's a lot of blood.

584
00:34:29,680 --> 00:34:33,559
- You said you stopped it.
- I didn't know it was happening.

585
00:34:33,600 --> 00:34:35,318
(Kevin groans, whines)

586
00:34:35,360 --> 00:34:39,148
Are you out of your fucking minds?
Frank, can you fucking hear me?

587
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:41,919
Hello!

588
00:34:41,960 --> 00:34:43,313
(Kevin groans)

589
00:34:44,080 --> 00:34:46,435
- God!
- (Frank) Come on.

590
00:34:48,040 --> 00:34:53,160
- Bean, stay and get that bleeding to stop.
- You sure you can get the bleeding to stop?

591
00:34:53,200 --> 00:34:54,952
(Door buzzer)

592
00:34:56,080 --> 00:34:58,469
I don't know, I'm not a doctor yet.

593
00:35:02,200 --> 00:35:05,351
Open the door, Frank!
Open the door!

594
00:35:05,400 --> 00:35:08,437
I swear to fucking God,
if you don't open this fucking door

595
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,311
I will have your asses arrested!

596
00:35:10,360 --> 00:35:13,477
- Are you fucking crazy?
- Open the fucking door, Frank!

597
00:35:14,840 --> 00:35:16,910
What do you want?

598
00:35:16,960 --> 00:35:19,679
Don't play dumb, Frank.

599
00:35:20,960 --> 00:35:22,518
You know why we're here.

600
00:35:27,160 --> 00:35:29,674
- Give us our toilet seats.
- What?

601
00:35:29,720 --> 00:35:32,712
Give us our toilet seats, our tampons,
our underwear

602
00:35:32,760 --> 00:35:35,718
and anything else you stole
when you broke into our house.

603
00:35:35,760 --> 00:35:37,079
Any of you take their things?

604
00:35:37,120 --> 00:35:39,475
- I'm so sick of this!
- Fuckin' jackass! Get them.

605
00:35:39,520 --> 00:35:41,636
- Curtis, upstairs, two pillowcases.
- Just go!

606
00:35:41,680 --> 00:35:43,875
Yell at me in front of the pledges
one more time...

607
00:35:43,920 --> 00:35:45,558
- Which room?
- The one Kevin's in.

608
00:35:45,600 --> 00:35:46,715
Whoa, whoa! Kevin?

609
00:35:47,800 --> 00:35:50,109
- You asshole. Go get them.
- Where's Kevin?

610
00:35:52,320 --> 00:35:54,117
- Kevin, look at me.
- (Groans)

611
00:35:55,120 --> 00:35:57,111
Just drink the water.

612
00:35:57,160 --> 00:35:59,720
Is the doctor here yet?

613
00:35:59,760 --> 00:36:01,239
Uh...

614
00:36:01,280 --> 00:36:04,795
No, not yet.
You're doing really good, man.

615
00:36:04,840 --> 00:36:08,116
What the fuck do you mean,
I'm doing good, man?

616
00:36:08,160 --> 00:36:12,153
- Kevin's passed out upstairs, he's drunk.
- Was it Kevin that did this?

617
00:36:12,200 --> 00:36:14,634
Hm?
He has a key to our house, doesn't he?

618
00:36:14,680 --> 00:36:18,389
- I don't fucking know.
- Bring my key down with our shit!

619
00:36:18,440 --> 00:36:22,353
- Calm down. Relax.
- You put him up to this, didn't you?

620
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:26,154
You put him up to it and now he's
upstairs hiding like a little pussy!

621
00:36:26,200 --> 00:36:28,589
Relax, Emily. Fucking relax.

622
00:36:29,560 --> 00:36:32,199
Give me the fucking shit!
Here. Take it.

623
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:34,117
(Emily) Let's go, girls.

624
00:36:38,360 --> 00:36:41,557
- What the fuck is this?
- One punk deserves another.

625
00:36:42,400 --> 00:36:45,119
- Emily, I swear to fuck...
- (Girls laugh, yell)

626
00:36:48,040 --> 00:36:50,793
Oh, my God. The lawn's on fire.

627
00:36:50,840 --> 00:36:52,273
- (AII shouting)
- Wait!

628
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,435
Don't touch me!

629
00:36:59,920 --> 00:37:02,229
(Indistinct shouting)

630
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:04,236
Expect the cops,
you house-robbing motherfuckers!

631
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:05,713
Do not call the police!

632
00:37:05,760 --> 00:37:10,038
Oh, yeah? Maybe you shouldn't break
into people's houses and steal their shit!

633
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:14,395
We need to get Mike and Kevin
out the house now.

634
00:37:18,360 --> 00:37:20,032
(Dog barking)

635
00:37:23,400 --> 00:37:26,676
Fuck. Fuck! Fuck!

636
00:37:30,200 --> 00:37:33,715
Oh, fuck. Oh, fuck. Oh, my God!

637
00:37:33,760 --> 00:37:35,830
- Emily, are you OK? Are you OK?
- Yeah.

638
00:37:35,880 --> 00:37:39,350
- Fuck. I'm sorry. Here.
- (Adam) Come on. Come on.

639
00:37:39,400 --> 00:37:44,030
- Emily, what the fuck have you done?
- Fuck, I'm so sorry. I'm so sorry!

640
00:37:44,080 --> 00:37:46,389
- (Sobs)
- What are you doing?

641
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:50,479
- I'm gonna call the police. I'm calling them.
- No, no, no! You can't do that!

642
00:37:50,520 --> 00:37:53,512
- I have to, this is an accident!
- Graham, go get Bean.

643
00:37:53,560 --> 00:37:55,994
Hang up the phone.
You can't do that, OK?

644
00:37:56,040 --> 00:37:57,632
Get Bean!

645
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,319
Please go inside!
There's nothing to see here.

646
00:38:00,360 --> 00:38:03,158
- (Sobs) Frank, I can't, OK?
- No. Hang up the phone!

647
00:38:03,200 --> 00:38:05,634
- (Emily shrieks)
- Emily, look at yourself.

648
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,079
You hit a guy drunk driving.

649
00:38:07,120 --> 00:38:10,112
If you call the police,
they're gonna throw your ass in jail.

650
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:11,434
(Emily sobs)

651
00:38:15,440 --> 00:38:17,351
- Still want them moved?
- Where's Bean?

652
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,073
- Behind me. You still want them moved?
- Not yet.

653
00:38:20,120 --> 00:38:23,510
- Emily, listen...
- Don't even think about telling to her.

654
00:38:23,560 --> 00:38:26,028
- (Emily sobs)
- Fuck! Bean!

655
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:29,311
- (Emily) Where the fuck is my phone?
- I fucking lost it.

656
00:38:29,360 --> 00:38:32,716
- Bean, get over here!
- Let's go!

657
00:38:34,040 --> 00:38:37,350
(Frank) Emily hit this guy.
Can you help him?

658
00:38:40,720 --> 00:38:42,039
Oh, fuck!

659
00:38:42,880 --> 00:38:45,075
- Can you help him?
- This is the guy.

660
00:38:45,120 --> 00:38:46,553
- What?
- This is the guy.

661
00:38:46,600 --> 00:38:48,670
- My guy!
- Are you fucking kidding me?

662
00:38:48,720 --> 00:38:51,473
(Emily sobs)
Wait, what's he talking about?

663
00:38:51,520 --> 00:38:55,149
- Un-fucking-believable, this shit!
- What are you talking about?

664
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:57,236
We know this guy.
We'll take care of it.

665
00:38:57,280 --> 00:38:59,748
- Get somebody to take her home.
- Are you sure he's OK?

666
00:38:59,800 --> 00:39:03,588
- How am I supposed to know?
- He's fine. Just get your shit and leave.

667
00:39:03,640 --> 00:39:05,915
- How do you know this guy?
- He's Bean's friend.

668
00:39:05,960 --> 00:39:10,078
You've done enough damage! Go home
before I get you arrested for drunk driving.

669
00:39:10,120 --> 00:39:13,237
You better not. You better not,
you fucking frat boys!

670
00:39:13,280 --> 00:39:16,670
I'll call the cops,
I'll tell them that you stole our toilets!

671
00:39:16,720 --> 00:39:20,349
I'll tell them that you stole our toilets,
you motherfuckers!

672
00:39:20,400 --> 00:39:23,949
- Emily, get the fuck outta here!
- I fucking hate you!

673
00:39:25,920 --> 00:39:29,629
(Frank) Get the fuck outta here!
Get the fuck outta here.

674
00:39:30,800 --> 00:39:33,473
Get someone to help you
get his car in the garage.

675
00:39:33,520 --> 00:39:37,433
I don't care how you do it, but make it
clear to Mike that we need that confession.

676
00:39:37,480 --> 00:39:39,789
And we're not fucking around any more.

677
00:39:44,360 --> 00:39:46,999
- Sit you down right in here.
- Jesus Christ.

678
00:39:47,040 --> 00:39:49,031
(Kevin) Who's that?

679
00:39:49,080 --> 00:39:50,752
Is that the doctor?

680
00:39:51,720 --> 00:39:53,836
Er, yeah.

681
00:39:53,880 --> 00:39:57,714
Oh, shit! What happened to him, man?

682
00:39:57,760 --> 00:39:59,796
What the fuck?

683
00:40:00,520 --> 00:40:03,193
This isn't happening.
I think he has a concussion.

684
00:40:03,240 --> 00:40:05,834
- Just give him a chance.
- He can barely keep his eyes open.

685
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:07,757
We need to get both of these guys help.

686
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:09,711
(Kevin) Oh!

687
00:40:11,000 --> 00:40:13,036
He's been shot in the arm, you said?

688
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:15,719
He's staring right at him
and can't tell where he's shot.

689
00:40:15,760 --> 00:40:17,432
It's in his shoulder.

690
00:40:17,480 --> 00:40:20,199
How...
Is the bullet still in?

691
00:40:20,240 --> 00:40:23,994
- There's a hole in his back.
- Has he had any trouble breathing?

692
00:40:24,040 --> 00:40:27,430
- (Frank) No, right?
- Er, I don't think so.

693
00:40:27,480 --> 00:40:29,152
How long's it been?

694
00:40:29,200 --> 00:40:32,510
- An hour or two, at most.
- That sounds about right.

695
00:40:33,840 --> 00:40:36,638
If there's no tissue damage,
I'm not saying definitely,

696
00:40:36,680 --> 00:40:40,275
- but he'll probably be OK for a little while.
- What do you mean "if'?

697
00:40:40,320 --> 00:40:44,313
We don't know the extent of the damage,
and he's already lost a lot of blood.

698
00:40:44,360 --> 00:40:46,874
Maybe in two or three hours
you'll have a problem.

699
00:40:46,920 --> 00:40:49,434
Two or three hours?
Where are you getting that from?

700
00:40:49,480 --> 00:40:52,472
- Stop. Bottom line, he's OK?
- For a few hours.

701
00:40:52,520 --> 00:40:54,078
No. No.

702
00:40:54,120 --> 00:40:56,350
No, he's wrong.
Let's do a hospital now.

703
00:40:56,400 --> 00:41:00,188
- You said you weren't a doctor yet.
- You're right, I'm not.

704
00:41:00,240 --> 00:41:02,959
I don't have to be a doctor to know
that with that level of blood loss,

705
00:41:03,000 --> 00:41:06,993
however much time he says Kevin has,
he has half, at the most.

706
00:41:07,040 --> 00:41:09,474
Are you kidding me?
This guy just hit his fucking head.

707
00:41:09,520 --> 00:41:12,114
We gotta take Kevin in now.
This doctor can't help.

708
00:41:12,160 --> 00:41:16,073
- He just did. He said we had time.
- And Bean says we have half.

709
00:41:16,120 --> 00:41:17,951
We need to do this now.

710
00:41:19,640 --> 00:41:21,232
(Door buzzer)

711
00:41:25,680 --> 00:41:27,671
- It's the police.
- What?

712
00:41:27,720 --> 00:41:30,075
OK. Do not freak out.

713
00:41:30,120 --> 00:41:31,838
There was a car crash,
we expected this.

714
00:41:31,880 --> 00:41:34,394
- Frank, this is...
- Bean, shut up! Shut up.

715
00:41:34,440 --> 00:41:38,194
Come here.
I need you now, OK? Keep Bean quiet.

716
00:41:38,240 --> 00:41:41,869
Help the doctor, and see if there's
something he can do about Kevin.

717
00:41:41,920 --> 00:41:43,876
What could he possibly do?

718
00:41:43,920 --> 00:41:45,592
He can fix him.

719
00:41:45,640 --> 00:41:47,949
(Door buzzer)

720
00:41:51,760 --> 00:41:54,354
Freeze, motherfucker,
or I'll blow your fucking frat head off!

721
00:41:54,400 --> 00:41:56,675
This is for what you did to ours, brother.

722
00:42:01,040 --> 00:42:04,077
Oh, my God!
What the fuck is your problem, Jennings?

723
00:42:04,120 --> 00:42:07,556
Get off me. We've only had, like, five calls
about you fuckers tonight.

724
00:42:07,600 --> 00:42:09,955
(Pants) I think I shit my pants.

725
00:42:15,960 --> 00:42:17,916
Holy shit.

726
00:42:17,960 --> 00:42:19,598
I know you.

727
00:42:21,480 --> 00:42:24,995
You're one of those niggers
who stole Collin's stereo out of his truck.

728
00:42:25,040 --> 00:42:26,473
It wasn't me.

729
00:42:26,520 --> 00:42:30,798
Yeah, it was. Tell him, Collin.
A nigger stole it out of your truck.

730
00:42:30,840 --> 00:42:32,478
I don't have a truck.

731
00:42:34,280 --> 00:42:36,748
I got a call about a crash.

732
00:42:36,800 --> 00:42:38,995
Yeah. (Pants)

733
00:42:39,040 --> 00:42:42,316
Oh, yeah-yeah. Some girls came by
and went a little crazy,

734
00:42:42,360 --> 00:42:43,839
but everything's fine now.

735
00:42:43,880 --> 00:42:46,235
No shit.

736
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,671
Why the hell are we still on the porch?

737
00:42:52,720 --> 00:42:54,278
Uh...

738
00:42:54,320 --> 00:42:55,912
Yeah.

739
00:43:05,720 --> 00:43:08,792
You're gonna stay there
and keep your hands to yourself.

740
00:43:08,840 --> 00:43:11,195
You're not gonna steal any more stereos

741
00:43:11,240 --> 00:43:15,074
and you sure as shit ain't gonna
be handling any broomsticks.

742
00:43:15,120 --> 00:43:17,236
Look, I'm not a racist...

743
00:43:17,280 --> 00:43:22,035
but I can't say I was surprised
when I heard what you did to that girl.

744
00:43:22,080 --> 00:43:24,310
Now, what are you gonna give us as proof?

745
00:43:24,360 --> 00:43:26,954
- Cos I can do this all night.
- I got nothing.

746
00:43:27,000 --> 00:43:28,672
Bullshit.

747
00:43:28,720 --> 00:43:30,358
(Kevin pants)

748
00:43:31,960 --> 00:43:33,996
Do they think I'm a pussy?

749
00:43:35,800 --> 00:43:37,119
Cos I'm not.

750
00:43:37,920 --> 00:43:39,035
(Wheezes)

751
00:43:40,280 --> 00:43:42,635
OK? I trust you guys, all right?

752
00:43:42,680 --> 00:43:45,513
- I know, I know.
- I can tough this out, man.

753
00:43:45,560 --> 00:43:49,712
I can get through this shit.
I can get through this.

754
00:43:49,760 --> 00:43:51,671
I'm not a pussy, OK?

755
00:43:53,120 --> 00:43:55,429
(Wheezes) Oh, fuck.

756
00:43:57,280 --> 00:44:00,511
Hey! I'm in the old house.
I got the right to kick it a little.

757
00:44:00,560 --> 00:44:03,028
- What's up, Jenny?
- Ain't much, man.

758
00:44:07,480 --> 00:44:09,357
Looks like a fun night.

759
00:44:09,400 --> 00:44:13,234
- (Muffled shouting)
- It's a little late to be messing with pledges.

760
00:44:13,280 --> 00:44:15,999
It's never too late to mess with pledges.

761
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,552
(Radio chatter)

762
00:44:31,360 --> 00:44:32,952
What?

763
00:44:34,040 --> 00:44:37,953
Come on, y'all aren't gonna say
anything about this, are you?

764
00:44:39,440 --> 00:44:43,831
- Wait. What the fuck is this?
- What the fuck are you doing? What the f...

765
00:44:43,880 --> 00:44:47,475
He's been shot. He needs to go
to a hospital, no one will take him.

766
00:44:47,520 --> 00:44:50,512
There's a doctor here, he's taking
care of it, he said Kevin's got time.

767
00:44:50,560 --> 00:44:53,870
The doctor is hurt,
he was the one in the wreck, OK?

768
00:44:53,920 --> 00:44:59,074
Look, if we take him to the hospital we
are fucked! We are in big fucking trouble!

769
00:44:59,120 --> 00:45:02,635
- I'm sorry, Frank.
- Hold on. Why are you in trouble?

770
00:45:02,680 --> 00:45:04,113
I can't tell you that.

771
00:45:04,160 --> 00:45:07,038
Yes, you can.
All right, why are you in trouble?

772
00:45:10,040 --> 00:45:13,589
We were doing initiation stuff in the
woods and he accidentally got shot.

773
00:45:13,640 --> 00:45:15,073
- Call an ambulance.
- Shut the fuck up!

774
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:16,712
You shut the fuck up, Frank!

775
00:45:18,000 --> 00:45:19,877
(Adam) Call a fucking ambulance!

776
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:24,072
Listen. You've gotta help us on this.
Let us handle this ourselves.

777
00:45:24,120 --> 00:45:25,997
I swear to God,
we're fucking taking care of it!

778
00:45:26,040 --> 00:45:30,591
- Fuck! Why did you even let me see this?
- Turn around, OK? You didn't see it.

779
00:45:30,640 --> 00:45:34,110
You don't want anything to do with this.
The doctor's gonna help...

780
00:45:34,160 --> 00:45:37,391
He's lost a lot of blood and he's fading!
Call an ambulance.

781
00:45:37,440 --> 00:45:41,718
Jesus. What kind of doctor is this,
a fucking moron?

782
00:45:41,760 --> 00:45:46,595
He's not a moron, he was just in that crash.
I'm pretty sure he has a concussion.

783
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:51,031
If he's got a concussion he shouldn't
be dealing with this kid, should he?

784
00:45:51,080 --> 00:45:53,958
(Male dispatcher) 22-10,
are you still in University Park?

785
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:57,719
Jennings, are you there?

786
00:45:57,760 --> 00:46:00,194
I'm still here.

787
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:02,629
I need you to get to Old Town
as soon as you can, are you busy?

788
00:46:02,680 --> 00:46:04,910
I'm a little tied up right now,
can somebody else go?

789
00:46:04,960 --> 00:46:07,997
Lee is there but I need to send more,
it's a mess.

790
00:46:10,400 --> 00:46:11,913
What kind of mess?

791
00:46:11,960 --> 00:46:15,157
This robbery call,
the convenience store clerk is missing.

792
00:46:15,200 --> 00:46:17,509
I'm rounding up every available
to look for him.

793
00:46:20,680 --> 00:46:23,114
Jesus, hold on.

794
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:28,793
I gotta call this in.

795
00:46:28,840 --> 00:46:30,831
- Yes, you do.
- No, you do not. Shut the fuck up.

796
00:46:30,880 --> 00:46:33,519
If you call this in, I go to jail,
it's that fucking simple.

797
00:46:33,560 --> 00:46:37,678
If you call this in, I'm going to fucking jail.
If you're cool with that, call it in.

798
00:46:37,720 --> 00:46:41,190
If I don't call this in and this goes bad,
I'm going to jail!

799
00:46:41,240 --> 00:46:44,550
It won't go bad, OK? I promise.
You're in your old house.

800
00:46:44,600 --> 00:46:46,750
Please, don't fuck us. All right?

801
00:46:46,800 --> 00:46:51,874
You gotta get our back on this. If you don't,
nobody will. What are brothers for,

802
00:46:51,920 --> 00:46:55,799
- if they don't step up when you need them?
- Don't give me that, man.

803
00:46:55,840 --> 00:46:57,671
- Please.
- He's gonna die.

804
00:46:57,720 --> 00:46:59,676
- You still with me?
- I'm still here.

805
00:46:59,720 --> 00:47:01,836
- Well?
- Please don't fucking do this.

806
00:47:01,880 --> 00:47:05,156
- Call them in, call them in.
- Don't fucking do it.

807
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:08,317
(Adam) Call it in.

808
00:47:12,520 --> 00:47:14,511
(Sighs) All right, I'll take it.

809
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:18,838
Are you fucking serious? He's fucking
bleeding on the goddamn couch!

810
00:47:18,880 --> 00:47:20,438
(Frank) Shut up.
(Adam) He's bleeding!

811
00:47:20,480 --> 00:47:21,993
- Get your shit together.
- I promise.

812
00:47:22,040 --> 00:47:23,473
I never saw this.

813
00:47:23,520 --> 00:47:27,911
- When I get back, this shit is cleaned up!
- What good is that gonna do?

814
00:47:27,960 --> 00:47:31,919
What good is it gonna fucking do?
They've been saying this all night.

815
00:47:31,960 --> 00:47:35,157
One more call from you guys, brother
or no brother, I can't help you.

816
00:47:35,200 --> 00:47:37,873
- Do not fuck me, Frank.
- You can't just walk away!

817
00:47:37,920 --> 00:47:39,911
- Jennings?
- I'm on the way.

818
00:47:39,960 --> 00:47:41,678
(Adam) Come on!

819
00:47:41,720 --> 00:47:43,039
No!

820
00:47:44,920 --> 00:47:47,434
- (Adam grunts)
- (Frank) Relax! You hear me?

821
00:47:47,480 --> 00:47:49,948
You said the store guy was missing?

822
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,514
The place is blown to hell
and the money from the safe is gone.

823
00:47:53,760 --> 00:47:55,193
Did you hear that?

824
00:47:55,240 --> 00:47:57,071
The radio!

825
00:47:57,120 --> 00:47:59,714
Don't you ever, ever
fucking go against us again.

826
00:47:59,760 --> 00:48:01,113
- Stop!
- In front of a cop?

827
00:48:01,160 --> 00:48:03,549
(Adam) I have it!

828
00:48:03,600 --> 00:48:05,830
Lock him in a room!
I don't wanna see him!

829
00:48:05,880 --> 00:48:09,429
I have something. If I take care of Mike
will you take Kevin to a hospital?

830
00:48:09,480 --> 00:48:10,799
What?

831
00:48:10,840 --> 00:48:13,559
I can get the leverage on Mike
if you take Kevin to a hospital.

832
00:48:13,600 --> 00:48:16,672
How? What did you get all of a sudden?
What just happened?

833
00:48:16,720 --> 00:48:20,713
- Say you'll take Kevin, or there's no deal.
- What did you just fucking hear?

834
00:48:20,760 --> 00:48:24,150
Say you'll take Kevin,
or you're never gonna find out.

835
00:48:24,200 --> 00:48:26,839
We don't have a plan, Bean says it's time,
I can get us out of this.

836
00:48:31,560 --> 00:48:34,279
We can wait all night and you can
wait for something to happen,

837
00:48:34,320 --> 00:48:37,073
or you can end it right now
by saying he goes.

838
00:48:38,400 --> 00:48:41,551
If you have something on Mike
that gets him out this house

839
00:48:41,600 --> 00:48:44,876
and ensures we weren't at that store,
then Kevin goes.

840
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:48,799
- Is that tape recorder working yet?
- Yeah. It works.

841
00:48:48,840 --> 00:48:50,751
Let's go.

842
00:48:50,800 --> 00:48:52,756
Hurry.

843
00:48:52,800 --> 00:48:55,155
We're gonna get you out of here, all right?

844
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,279
(Collin) Listen to him!

845
00:48:57,320 --> 00:49:00,551
- Listen to what he's telling you.
- (Graham) You better talk to us.

846
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,636
- (Music off)
- What the fuck is this?

847
00:49:04,160 --> 00:49:07,357
Looks like something out of a horror movie.
What are you guys doing?

848
00:49:07,400 --> 00:49:09,994
- We're getting what we need...
- Get the fuck outta here. Go.

849
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:20,515
Money from the store is missing, Mike.

850
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:23,272
I need to know where it is.

851
00:49:24,920 --> 00:49:27,195
I need to know where the money is, Mike.

852
00:49:30,000 --> 00:49:32,639
Listen to me,
I can find money for you someplace.

853
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:35,433
I can pay you, if that's what it takes.

854
00:49:35,480 --> 00:49:38,358
But I know that
that money is missing.

855
00:49:38,400 --> 00:49:42,393
I need to know where it is,
and Kevin goes to the hospital.

856
00:49:42,440 --> 00:49:47,753
If you let me know where the money is,
you walk away from this, we all walk away.

857
00:49:47,800 --> 00:49:49,791
Tell me where the money is.

858
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,473
I took it, OK?

859
00:50:02,520 --> 00:50:04,670
I saw my chance and I took it.
So what?

860
00:50:04,720 --> 00:50:06,438
(Mike sniffs)

861
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:10,830
All you had to do was say something
and we would have let you go.

862
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:13,838
How am I supposed to know that, huh?
How am I supposed to know that?

863
00:50:15,720 --> 00:50:17,597
You just keep fucking with me.

864
00:50:17,640 --> 00:50:19,073
I don't know what you want.

865
00:50:19,120 --> 00:50:23,432
OK? Trying to tape-record some
bullshit that happened, what, a year...

866
00:50:23,480 --> 00:50:25,152
two years ago, huh?

867
00:50:26,280 --> 00:50:29,431
I didn't do that shit.
I didn't do it.

868
00:50:29,480 --> 00:50:32,313
There were three other cats there
messing with that girl.

869
00:50:32,360 --> 00:50:34,555
I tried to stop that shit from happening.

870
00:50:34,600 --> 00:50:36,591
I tried to get her to walk away.

871
00:50:36,640 --> 00:50:39,279
- I tried to get her to leave...
- I don't need to know.

872
00:50:39,320 --> 00:50:41,550
You're gonna listen to me!

873
00:50:44,640 --> 00:50:46,949
I tried to get her to walk away,

874
00:50:48,320 --> 00:50:50,880
and the dumbass kept walking back,

875
00:50:50,920 --> 00:50:53,559
and those dudes kept fucking with her.

876
00:50:54,760 --> 00:50:56,591
So fuck you, man.

877
00:50:56,640 --> 00:51:00,110
(Sniffs) OK? You can call me
a bad person for taking that money,

878
00:51:00,160 --> 00:51:03,072
but... I didn't touch her.

879
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:05,111
I didn't touch that girl.

880
00:51:10,000 --> 00:51:12,230
(Sobs) Fuck you, man.

881
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:15,352
I'm sorry,
but my friend is bleeding upstairs

882
00:51:15,400 --> 00:51:17,436
and I need to get him some help.

883
00:51:17,480 --> 00:51:21,359
I'm sorry. You have your money,
we have our leverage.

884
00:51:21,400 --> 00:51:25,473
- I don't want the money, man. I don't want it.
- Then we'll get you a ride home.

885
00:51:25,520 --> 00:51:30,310
- I want nothing to do with you cats.
- Scott, we need to go get Kevin now, OK?

886
00:51:35,280 --> 00:51:39,512
Tell me one more time why you wouldn't
say two black guys robbed your store?

887
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:43,917
I don't think anybody would have trouble
believing the money was stolen by a nigger.

888
00:51:43,960 --> 00:51:45,791
(Frank) Leave him alone.

889
00:51:51,560 --> 00:51:55,473
Tell me your story for the police,
so we can make sure everything's cool.

890
00:51:58,080 --> 00:52:00,150
The only way everything is cool...

891
00:52:01,000 --> 00:52:02,956
is if we put that money back.

892
00:52:03,000 --> 00:52:04,228
(Adam) What?

893
00:52:05,200 --> 00:52:06,758
Yeah.

894
00:52:09,400 --> 00:52:11,038
Yeah, you heard me.

895
00:52:12,920 --> 00:52:16,549
The only way I'm cool...
is if you take that money back to the store.

896
00:52:16,600 --> 00:52:18,795
Are you out of your fucking mind?

897
00:52:18,840 --> 00:52:21,400
No, no! You have something on us,
we have something on you.

898
00:52:21,440 --> 00:52:25,353
This is over. Get Kevin to the hospital.
Get Kevin to the hospital right now!

899
00:52:25,400 --> 00:52:28,198
What the fuck good is it gonna do
to take the money back?

900
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:31,516
If a white boy takes the money back,
the black clerk won't get blamed for stealing.

901
00:52:31,560 --> 00:52:34,028
No one is gonna think you took the money.

902
00:52:34,080 --> 00:52:37,311
Everyone think I touched that girl?
You did. You did.

903
00:52:37,360 --> 00:52:39,828
Why? Cos I'm black and I was there.

904
00:52:39,880 --> 00:52:43,316
Same way they're gonna think I stole
that money - cos I'm black and I was there.

905
00:52:43,360 --> 00:52:47,239
I'm gonna make sure no one thinks I stole
that money, cos a white boy's taking it back.

906
00:52:47,280 --> 00:52:50,431
- You are not gonna tell us what to do.
- Yes, I am. Listen to me.

907
00:52:50,480 --> 00:52:52,471
I'd rather take my chances with the cops

908
00:52:52,520 --> 00:52:54,556
than walk out of here
knowing you got shit on me.

909
00:52:54,600 --> 00:52:56,955
When I walk outta here,
I'm walking out crystal clean.

910
00:52:57,000 --> 00:53:00,913
Let's calm down and think this through, OK?
That's a crime scene.

911
00:53:00,960 --> 00:53:03,520
We're not taking stolen money
back to a crime scene.

912
00:53:03,560 --> 00:53:05,869
The owner has another store.
Take the money there.

913
00:53:05,920 --> 00:53:06,909
No!

914
00:53:06,960 --> 00:53:09,599
You're gonna take your
fucking money and leave.

915
00:53:09,640 --> 00:53:11,949
We are not taking the money
back to your store,

916
00:53:12,000 --> 00:53:13,911
a different store or any other store.

917
00:53:13,960 --> 00:53:16,520
Listen to me.
You're walking away with three grand.

918
00:53:16,560 --> 00:53:19,393
We could give you another thousand,
so we don't have to take it back.

919
00:53:19,440 --> 00:53:22,273
But we can't take it back. You can
have the tape, we can't take it back.

920
00:53:22,320 --> 00:53:25,073
No, no,
we're not giving you the tape,

921
00:53:25,120 --> 00:53:27,873
we'll destroy it
but it's not leaving this room.

922
00:53:29,320 --> 00:53:33,279
Remember, back at the store, you asked
what I was gonna say to the cops?

923
00:53:35,440 --> 00:53:37,317
Yeah.

924
00:53:37,360 --> 00:53:41,035
There's only one way to guarantee
I'll say what you want me to say.

925
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:43,310
That's by taking that money back.

926
00:53:46,040 --> 00:53:48,508
(Breathes heavily)
That is not gonna happen.

927
00:53:48,560 --> 00:53:52,633
The last thing we're gonna do is take
stolen money - your stolen money -

928
00:53:52,680 --> 00:53:54,671
back to a convenience store, period.

929
00:53:54,720 --> 00:53:56,950
Well, that's the deal.

930
00:53:58,400 --> 00:54:02,313
I've been screwed over all night.
Now it's your turn to get fucked.

931
00:54:02,360 --> 00:54:04,954
- What are we gonna do?
- We gotta think of something.

932
00:54:05,000 --> 00:54:06,149
- What?
- I don't know.

933
00:54:06,200 --> 00:54:09,749
- What is our plan?
- I don't fucking know! Did you not hear me?

934
00:54:17,760 --> 00:54:19,591
- I'll do it.
- What?

935
00:54:19,640 --> 00:54:20,755
I'll do it.

936
00:54:22,080 --> 00:54:26,392
We don't have a fucking plan. If this means
Kevin's gonna go to a hospital, I'll do it.

937
00:54:26,440 --> 00:54:29,079
- You're gonna do this for this guy?
- I'm gonna do it for Kevin, too.

938
00:54:29,120 --> 00:54:31,236
Don't let him out of your sight,
he'll go to the cops.

939
00:54:31,280 --> 00:54:34,556
Fuck you. If you don't trust me,
you can do it yourself.

940
00:54:34,600 --> 00:54:38,718
That's what I thought, so before
we waste any more time, let's do this!

941
00:54:41,200 --> 00:54:44,351
You don't have any alternatives.
You have to use me. Let's go.

942
00:54:44,400 --> 00:54:47,437
All right, shut the fuck up!
We'll fucking do it!

943
00:54:49,200 --> 00:54:52,510
Make sure you put that money in the safe
and bring me some proof.

944
00:54:52,560 --> 00:54:54,869
I don't trust you motherfuckers.

945
00:55:03,880 --> 00:55:06,758
- Let's go.
- Let's get it on.

946
00:55:06,800 --> 00:55:08,995
(Adam) Where we going?
(Collin) Get him up.

947
00:55:09,040 --> 00:55:11,031
(Bean) Come on, one, two, three.

948
00:55:11,080 --> 00:55:12,911
(Kevin cries out in pain)

949
00:55:12,960 --> 00:55:14,951
(Bean) Watch it.

950
00:55:24,440 --> 00:55:27,000
(Bean) Get the door.
(Collin) Easy.

951
00:55:27,040 --> 00:55:28,553
(Adam) Slide him in.

952
00:55:32,080 --> 00:55:33,593
(Engine starts)

953
00:55:35,720 --> 00:55:37,119
(Car drives off)

954
00:55:57,480 --> 00:55:59,072
(Sighs)

955
00:56:00,240 --> 00:56:02,435
As soon as the money's back, we're good.

956
00:56:03,440 --> 00:56:06,113
The owner was missing a few grand,
and now it's back.

957
00:56:06,160 --> 00:56:11,154
Nobody's bringing in the FBI and the cops
have bigger stuff to be concerned with.

958
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,997
All right?

959
00:56:16,360 --> 00:56:17,588
Here.

960
00:56:20,680 --> 00:56:21,669
I don't want that.

961
00:56:21,720 --> 00:56:24,234
It's better to have it and not need it.

962
00:56:25,280 --> 00:56:27,111
No.

963
00:56:32,040 --> 00:56:33,871
(Exhales)

964
00:56:49,840 --> 00:56:51,273
What are we doing?

965
00:56:51,320 --> 00:56:53,754
Waiting to make sure Adam does
what he's supposed to.

966
00:56:53,800 --> 00:56:55,119
What?

967
00:57:27,440 --> 00:57:28,759
(Quietly) Oh my God!

968
00:57:30,120 --> 00:57:32,270
(Breathes heavily) Oh my God!

969
00:57:37,560 --> 00:57:40,199
Just chill the fuck out.
Just chill out.

970
00:57:54,840 --> 00:57:56,068
(Breathes heavily)

971
00:58:04,240 --> 00:58:05,514
I'm not gonna hurt you.

972
00:58:05,560 --> 00:58:09,235
I need you to get this to the guy
who owns the store.

973
00:58:09,280 --> 00:58:11,589
I robbed the store earlier on Roslyn, OK?

974
00:58:11,640 --> 00:58:13,153
O-OK.

975
00:58:14,280 --> 00:58:16,316
- Here it is.
- I'll give you the money.

976
00:58:16,360 --> 00:58:17,349
No, no!

977
00:58:17,400 --> 00:58:19,516
You don't have to explain,
I don't want trouble.

978
00:58:19,560 --> 00:58:23,030
No, stop! That's not what I want.
That is not what I want.

979
00:58:23,080 --> 00:58:24,957
OK. OK.

980
00:58:29,520 --> 00:58:32,114
(Coughs and gurgles)

981
00:58:35,280 --> 00:58:37,714
Holy shit! Has he done that before?

982
00:58:37,760 --> 00:58:40,115
Coughed up blood? No.
We have to go.

983
00:58:40,160 --> 00:58:43,072
- Just hang on. Any minute.
- He's gonna fucking die on us!

984
00:58:43,120 --> 00:58:45,759
Chill the fuck out!
We are waiting on the call!

985
00:58:45,800 --> 00:58:47,870
This is not a robbery.

986
00:58:47,920 --> 00:58:50,673
I just want to give this back.

987
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,472
So, open up the safe.

988
00:58:52,520 --> 00:58:56,195
This isn't a robbery, but you want
the safe open? What is this exactly?

989
00:58:56,240 --> 00:58:59,676
I just wanna give the money back!
Please just open up the safe!

990
00:59:01,440 --> 00:59:03,192
Get outta here! Go!

991
00:59:04,360 --> 00:59:05,713
(Door bells jingle)

992
00:59:06,960 --> 00:59:08,552
Please just open up the safe.

993
00:59:13,240 --> 00:59:14,719
Oh, shit.

994
00:59:14,760 --> 00:59:18,753
Pardon me if I'm confused. We don't
normally get guys wearing masks...

995
00:59:18,800 --> 00:59:20,233
give us money.

996
00:59:21,800 --> 00:59:25,475
(Clerk) Let me remember
the combination to the safe.

997
00:59:30,200 --> 00:59:32,555
(Quietly) Get the fuck out. Go!

998
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:37,070
- Put it down and get outta here!
- Put it down! Put it down!

999
00:59:39,240 --> 00:59:40,434
(Adam) Stop!

1000
00:59:41,520 --> 00:59:45,433
Look! We don't want this.
None of us want this.

1001
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:50,190
I just need to give this to you.

1002
00:59:50,240 --> 00:59:54,472
- Wanna get shot? Take the fucking money!
- Shut the fuck up!

1003
00:59:54,520 --> 00:59:55,953
Shut up!

1004
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:59,595
I'm not robbing you. Look at me.
I'm not robbing you.

1005
00:59:59,640 --> 01:00:03,076
Listen, just take this money,
I'll give you more money too, OK?

1006
01:00:03,120 --> 01:00:04,997
No one will get hurt.

1007
01:00:05,040 --> 01:00:07,634
Take this, put it in the safe.
Take some for yourself.

1008
01:00:07,680 --> 01:00:11,036
- Put it in the fucking safe!
- Chill the fuck out and wait outside!

1009
01:00:11,080 --> 01:00:12,479
Get out, both of you!

1010
01:00:12,520 --> 01:00:15,478
Please take the money and put it in the safe!

1011
01:00:15,520 --> 01:00:18,637
No. No! No! No!

1012
01:00:19,360 --> 01:00:21,316
Stop!

1013
01:00:21,360 --> 01:00:22,839
If he goes away...

1014
01:00:22,880 --> 01:00:25,519
If he goes the fuck away,
will you put your gun down?

1015
01:00:29,120 --> 01:00:32,715
Put your fucking gun down, Frank,
put your fucking gun down!

1016
01:00:32,760 --> 01:00:35,797
- Not before he does.
- The gun isn't pointed at you!

1017
01:00:36,920 --> 01:00:38,956
Put your fucking gun down and go!

1018
01:00:50,760 --> 01:00:52,273
(Breathes heavily) OK.

1019
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:57,395
Now you just put your gun down...
and take this...

1020
01:00:57,440 --> 01:00:59,237
and I'll give you some money.

1021
01:01:00,200 --> 01:01:02,555
- How much?
- 50 bucks.

1022
01:01:03,600 --> 01:01:05,158
- 100.
- Done.

1023
01:01:05,200 --> 01:01:07,839
- You promise?
- I'll give it to you right now.

1024
01:01:28,240 --> 01:01:30,708
(Adam) OK, I need the surveillance tape.

1025
01:01:30,760 --> 01:01:33,593
- Just point me in the direction.
- The back room.

1026
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:36,234
We're gonna go in the back room.

1027
01:01:38,680 --> 01:01:40,716
- In here?
- Yeah.

1028
01:01:43,840 --> 01:01:45,831
(Clerk coughs)

1029
01:01:56,600 --> 01:01:57,749
- Is that all right?
- Yeah.

1030
01:02:02,920 --> 01:02:07,391
If that money is not in the safe, we have
proof that it was and this goes to the cops.

1031
01:02:07,440 --> 01:02:09,192
It'll be there, OK?

1032
01:02:10,200 --> 01:02:13,317
If you say anything other than
a couple of white guys came in with masks

1033
01:02:13,360 --> 01:02:15,669
and returned the money,
we're gonna have problems.

1034
01:02:15,720 --> 01:02:17,597
(Exhales)

1035
01:02:22,920 --> 01:02:24,797
- (Phone rings)
- Are we good?

1036
01:02:24,840 --> 01:02:26,637
We're good, take him in.

1037
01:02:29,480 --> 01:02:31,675
They're just now fucking taking him?

1038
01:02:31,720 --> 01:02:33,312
(Bean) Get out of the way! Move!

1039
01:02:33,360 --> 01:02:35,794
- (Nurse) What happened?
- He got shot in the shoulder.

1040
01:02:35,840 --> 01:02:38,070
He was cleaning his gun,
we were gonna go hunting.

1041
01:02:38,120 --> 01:02:40,031
You guys hang tight, we're gonna go here.

1042
01:02:40,080 --> 01:02:43,072
You guys hang tight back there,
you can't come in with us.

1043
01:02:44,200 --> 01:02:45,519
Let's go.

1044
01:03:26,640 --> 01:03:30,030
- (Frank) So?
- So, Kevin's OK. I just got the call.

1045
01:03:30,080 --> 01:03:33,595
Everything's gonna be fine.
They don't even think the bullet hit anything.

1046
01:03:33,640 --> 01:03:37,519
They're checking for tissue damage,
but so far everyone's bought the story.

1047
01:03:37,560 --> 01:03:39,516
Show Mike his proof
and get him outta here.

1048
01:03:39,560 --> 01:03:41,471
- Don't let him keep it.
- Cool.

1049
01:03:48,480 --> 01:03:49,708
(Snorts)

1050
01:03:50,800 --> 01:03:54,156
After all this, we made it.
Told you we'd get outta this.

1051
01:03:55,560 --> 01:03:57,630
Just gotta stick together.

1052
01:04:00,440 --> 01:04:02,192
Fuck you.

1053
01:04:06,840 --> 01:04:09,752
- Hey! What are you doing?
- I'm out.

1054
01:04:09,800 --> 01:04:12,951
- I'm taking my things, and the tape.
- You are not taking the tape.

1055
01:04:14,960 --> 01:04:16,837
I'm taking the tape...

1056
01:04:16,880 --> 01:04:21,908
or I'm calling up the police, and I'll tell 'em
about our whole fucking night. You decide.

1057
01:04:23,160 --> 01:04:25,549
Here he comes, guys, here he comes.

1058
01:04:25,600 --> 01:04:27,556
(AII cheer)

1059
01:04:27,600 --> 01:04:29,955
- Where's Scott?
- He went downstairs.

1060
01:04:30,000 --> 01:04:31,797
(Frank) Fucking traitor!

1061
01:04:31,840 --> 01:04:33,273
(AII shout)

1062
01:04:33,320 --> 01:04:34,992
(Frank) He fucking hit me!

1063
01:04:42,360 --> 01:04:44,828
(AII shout encouragement)

1064
01:04:51,120 --> 01:04:53,270
Damn right you're fucking out!

1065
01:04:53,320 --> 01:04:54,435
(Adam coughs)

1066
01:04:54,480 --> 01:04:57,472
You know what coulda happened tonight?
We were fucked!

1067
01:04:57,520 --> 01:04:59,875
We were fucked and you fucked us!

1068
01:05:02,200 --> 01:05:05,510
We said, "We can get through this
if we all just stick together."

1069
01:05:07,920 --> 01:05:12,391
We can't get through adversity if we're
all going in different fucking directions!

1070
01:05:13,800 --> 01:05:18,794
We returned Mike's money, Kevin's OK,
we dropped the fucking doctor off.

1071
01:05:19,880 --> 01:05:21,916
And after all this, we made it.

1072
01:05:22,680 --> 01:05:24,875
We're not gonna lose.

1073
01:05:24,920 --> 01:05:27,036
Guys like us don't fucking lose.

1074
01:05:29,440 --> 01:05:30,634
No thanks to you!

1075
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,671
- (Whooping)
- (Adam coughs)

1076
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:33,914
(Laughter)

1077
01:05:36,040 --> 01:05:38,349
(Jackson) What the fuck is this?

1078
01:05:45,080 --> 01:05:49,756
- Where the hell you been all night?
- Frank told me to take one for the team.

1079
01:05:51,960 --> 01:05:53,712
(Coughs)

1080
01:06:03,120 --> 01:06:05,076
Collin, dude, where are your keys?

1081
01:06:05,120 --> 01:06:06,473
Upstairs. Why?

1082
01:06:06,520 --> 01:06:08,795
Go get 'em, man.
Fucking go get 'em, dude.

1083
01:06:08,840 --> 01:06:10,353
Fucking go get 'em. Shit!

1084
01:06:11,360 --> 01:06:14,796
Hey, man! Hold on one second, dude!
We're gonna get you out.

1085
01:06:37,960 --> 01:06:39,837
He doesn't have a pulse.

1086
01:06:57,400 --> 01:06:58,719
(Frank) Hey.

1087
01:06:58,760 --> 01:07:01,115
What are you doing?

1088
01:07:01,160 --> 01:07:03,116
(Dialling)

1089
01:07:03,160 --> 01:07:07,517
At least let us...
Let us get our story straight.

1090
01:07:09,040 --> 01:07:10,917
There's only one story.

1091
01:07:14,880 --> 01:07:16,438
(Kevin) So I go in.

1092
01:07:21,480 --> 01:07:25,234
I ask him for $19.10.

1093
01:07:28,040 --> 01:07:29,519
(Voice fades)

1094
01:07:38,360 --> 01:07:41,557
Kevin, the other guy,
got shot at the convenience store.

1095
01:07:42,720 --> 01:07:46,599
They brought him here to help him,
they didn't want to take him to a hospital.

1096
01:07:48,800 --> 01:07:51,519
They knew it wouldn't be good
to have a pledge in hospital

1097
01:07:51,560 --> 01:07:53,391
with a bullet hole in his shoulder,

1098
01:07:53,440 --> 01:07:55,670
and they didn't want to get in trouble.

1099
01:07:57,800 --> 01:07:58,869
We kidnapped Mike.

1100
01:08:00,240 --> 01:08:05,189
He'll tell you something different, but we did.
He didn't do anything wrong.

1101
01:08:13,240 --> 01:08:15,674
How did the kid get into the trunk of the car?

1102
01:08:18,240 --> 01:08:19,434
I don't know.

1103
01:08:23,480 --> 01:08:24,799
We weren't even here.

1104
01:08:29,640 --> 01:08:33,076
But with everything going on,
I guess they just forgot about him.

1105
01:08:35,920 --> 01:08:38,878
Jennings said you tried to help,
is that right?

1106
01:08:41,040 --> 01:08:42,792
Yeah.

1107
01:08:42,840 --> 01:08:46,037
They took your phone
and held you down at one point?

1108
01:08:46,080 --> 01:08:47,274
Yeah.

1109
01:08:47,320 --> 01:08:50,676
But you're the one
that eventually called 911?

1110
01:08:55,320 --> 01:08:59,393
You help me piece together exactly
what happened last night,

1111
01:08:59,440 --> 01:09:02,955
and we'll see if I can help you come
out of this thing OK. Got it?

1112
01:09:04,000 --> 01:09:05,592
You're under arrest.

1113
01:09:08,400 --> 01:09:13,554
You have the right to remain silent. Anything
you say can and will be used against you.

1114
01:09:13,600 --> 01:09:16,910
You have the right to an attorney...

1115
01:09:16,960 --> 01:09:20,032
(Detective)
Do we understand each other?

1116
01:09:29,400 --> 01:09:30,719
Yeah.

1117
01:09:31,600 --> 01:09:33,272
(Detective) Good.
