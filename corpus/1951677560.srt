1
00:02:11,080 --> 00:02:12,957
What are you doing here?

2
00:02:31,960 --> 00:02:33,632
Who has touched you?

3
00:02:41,040 --> 00:02:42,359
Imhotep!

4
00:02:43,040 --> 00:02:44,268
My priest!

Pharaoh's bodyguards.

6
00:03:04,640 --> 00:03:05,993
You must go! Save yourself!

00:03:06,080 --> 00:03:08,719
-No.
-Only you can resurrect me!

8
00:03:12,320 --> 00:03:13,309
I won't leave you!

9
00:03:13,400 --> 00:03:14,753
Get away from me!

10
00:03:17,160 --> 00:03:18,639
You shall live again!

11
00:03:20,080 --> 00:03:21,798
I will resurrect you!

12
00:03:25,520 --> 00:03:27,909
My body is no longer his temple!

16
00:11:24,120 --> 00:11:25,838
And what of this one?

17
00:11:42,120 --> 00:11:43,951
-Should we kill him?
-No.

18
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:45,958
The desert will kill him.

Come with me
my Princess Anck-su-namun.

23
01:05:11,400 --> 01:05:13,277
The language of the slaves...

24
01:05:15,160 --> 01:05:17,469
...I may have use for you.

25
01:05:19,680 --> 01:05:21,193
And the rewards...

26
01:05:22,400 --> 01:05:23,913
... will be great.

I thank you.

31
01:25:39,680 --> 01:25:40,874
Kill them all!

32
01:34:10,480 --> 01:34:11,595
Kill them...

33
01:34:12,720 --> 01:34:14,517
...and wake the others.

34
01:39:35,320 --> 01:39:37,993
With your death, Anck-su-namun shall live.

37
01:44:20,640 --> 01:44:21,959
Destroy him!

38
01:44:25,200 --> 01:44:27,031
I command you to destroy him!

39
01:44:40,680 --> 01:44:42,272
Give me that book!

40
01:44:55,880 --> 01:44:57,154
Now you die.

41
01:45:46,560 --> 01:45:48,949
Now it's your turn.
