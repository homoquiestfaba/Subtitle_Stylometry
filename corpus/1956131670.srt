- is what I'm being.
- Oh my God.

544
00:30:30,913 --> 00:30:31,746
Please don't hurt yourself.

545
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:32,705
I'm not gonna hurt myself.

546
00:30:32,707 --> 00:30:33,875
Oh, God, here we go.

547
00:30:35,335 --> 00:30:37,209
That's right, take it all in,
sweetheart,

548
00:30:37,211 --> 00:30:38,878
- take it all in.
- Oh my God!

549
00:30:38,880 --> 00:30:41,046
(BOTH LAUGHING)

550
00:30:41,048 --> 00:30:42,882
DARREL: They should make
this shit an Olympic event.

551
00:30:42,884 --> 00:30:44,257
- Oh, don't hurt yourself.
- Ah, here we go.

552
00:30:44,259 --> 00:30:45,468
SYDNEY: There's a step.

553
00:30:45,470 --> 00:30:46,803
DARREL: Yeah, I see, I see
the step

554
00:30:46,805 --> 00:30:48,304
in your split level studio.

555
00:30:48,306 --> 00:30:49,764
(LAUGHS)

556
00:30:49,766 --> 00:30:50,597
Whose idea was that?

557
00:30:50,599 --> 00:30:52,016
It makes it look it bigger.

558
00:30:52,018 --> 00:30:54,977
DARREL: Because that
makes a lot of fucking sense.

559
00:30:54,979 --> 00:30:55,853
Here we go.

560
00:30:55,855 --> 00:30:57,190
I have kale chips.

561
00:30:58,857 --> 00:31:00,525
Fuck gonna do with kale chips?

562
00:31:00,527 --> 00:31:02,651
Did you ever fucking
go grocery shopping?

563
00:31:02,653 --> 00:31:03,819
No, I actually don't.

564
00:31:03,821 --> 00:31:07,699
You've got tangerines and a
Keurig so

565
00:31:07,701 --> 00:31:09,033
that's where we are.
(SYDNEY LAUGHS)

566
00:31:09,035 --> 00:31:10,870
Uh, how's grits sound?

567
00:31:11,829 --> 00:31:12,703
SYDNEY: Grits.

568
00:31:12,705 --> 00:31:13,537
- I like grits.
- Great, 'cause

569
00:31:13,539 --> 00:31:15,288
that's the only thing
in your kitchen.

570
00:31:15,290 --> 00:31:16,373
Grits are delicious.

571
00:31:16,375 --> 00:31:18,375
Yeah, apparently so
are kale chips.

572
00:31:18,377 --> 00:31:20,210
And that's just weird.
(SYDNEY LAUGHS)

573
00:31:20,212 --> 00:31:21,047
Okay.

574
00:31:26,385 --> 00:31:27,634
I gotta say, I really like
this view.

575
00:31:27,636 --> 00:31:30,555
You got a dirty bowl,
come clean out your sink.

576
00:31:30,557 --> 00:31:34,558
(SYDNEY LAUGHS)
My back.

577
00:31:34,560 --> 00:31:36,018
Oh, man.

578
00:31:36,020 --> 00:31:37,562
I need to take a picture of you.

579
00:31:37,564 --> 00:31:39,646
DARREL: You don't need
to take a picture honestly.

580
00:31:39,648 --> 00:31:41,231
Just asked you.

581
00:31:41,233 --> 00:31:42,734
Oh, oh.

582
00:31:42,736 --> 00:31:44,568
Not the first time
you've seen an ass before.

583
00:31:44,570 --> 00:31:46,946
Oh, I wish it was just
the ass I was seeing.

584
00:31:46,948 --> 00:31:49,574
DARREL: I'm winded,
that's for damn sure.

585
00:31:49,576 --> 00:31:50,533
You see that damn much.
(SYDNEY GIGGLES)

586
00:31:50,535 --> 00:31:51,659
SYDNEY: Well, you're
working pretty hard.

587
00:31:51,661 --> 00:31:52,910
DARREL: I'm working
pretty hard.

588
00:31:52,912 --> 00:31:54,411
SYDNEY: Okay, well, it should
be good.

589
00:31:54,413 --> 00:31:55,287
DARREL: It should be good.

590
00:31:55,289 --> 00:31:56,538
Fine, I'm gonna take it out.

591
00:31:56,540 --> 00:31:58,623
If they're lukewarm grits I
don't wanna hear shit about it.

592
00:31:58,625 --> 00:32:00,959
You're gonna burn something
and it's

593
00:32:00,961 --> 00:32:01,960
- not gonna be pleasant.
- Not gonna burn something.

594
00:32:01,962 --> 00:32:03,129
It'll be all right.

595
00:32:03,131 --> 00:32:04,756
You know how much it costs
to get a six-foot black dude

596
00:32:04,758 --> 00:32:06,507
with grits delivered to
your bed?

597
00:32:06,509 --> 00:32:07,382
What the fuck?

598
00:32:07,384 --> 00:32:08,343
SYDNEY: Probably in the
thousands.

599
00:32:08,345 --> 00:32:10,303
Why do you have so
many rugs in your house?

600
00:32:10,305 --> 00:32:11,970
I thank you for your help.

601
00:32:11,972 --> 00:32:12,805
You wanna get you
a couple chairs

602
00:32:12,807 --> 00:32:14,097
and come over here and help me.

603
00:32:14,099 --> 00:32:15,182
No, all right, no.

604
00:32:15,184 --> 00:32:16,017
- That's fine.
- No, I think I'm good.

605
00:32:16,019 --> 00:32:16,892
- No, it's cool
- I don't like

606
00:32:16,894 --> 00:32:17,768
- what you're doing.
- It's cool.

607
00:32:17,770 --> 00:32:18,603
- I'm gonna stay over here.
- Your bra's still on it.

608
00:32:18,605 --> 00:32:19,478
What's the nearest hospital

609
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,605
in case I actually
do almost die?

610
00:32:21,607 --> 00:32:22,606
I don't know.

611
00:32:22,608 --> 00:32:24,232
- All right, well...
- It's 911.

612
00:32:24,234 --> 00:32:25,276
It's all the same number.

613
00:32:25,278 --> 00:32:28,071
All right, well you
dial 'cause you're white.

614
00:32:28,073 --> 00:32:30,489
(SYDNEY LAUGHS)

615
00:32:30,491 --> 00:32:31,615
- I'm fine.
- Oh!

616
00:32:31,617 --> 00:32:32,784
DARREL: Can you not,
show a little confidence.

617
00:32:32,786 --> 00:32:33,785
- Okay.
- You're low

618
00:32:33,787 --> 00:32:35,161
and I'm not falling
off a fucking building.

619
00:32:35,163 --> 00:32:36,411
- You're good.
- Don't be so dramatic.

620
00:32:36,413 --> 00:32:38,331
- Can I, can I help you?
- Stop these things.

621
00:32:38,333 --> 00:32:39,500
Oh, now you wanna help.

622
00:32:40,460 --> 00:32:41,918
I just crawled across your
floor with butt ass naked

623
00:32:41,920 --> 00:32:44,253
on a chair and now you wanna
help me.

624
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:45,962
This is why we can't have nice
things.

625
00:32:45,964 --> 00:32:46,963
- Be careful.
- You ready?

626
00:32:46,965 --> 00:32:47,923
- Yeah.
- You be careful now.

627
00:32:47,925 --> 00:32:50,133
I'm back now, move, so you can
see, move.

628
00:32:50,135 --> 00:32:51,052
Ready?

Yep, like a graceful
fucking swan.

632
00:32:55,141 --> 00:32:56,391
- Wow!
- That was impressive, right?

633
00:32:56,393 --> 00:32:57,642
That was amazing.

634
00:32:57,644 --> 00:32:58,934
You're goddamn right it was.

635
00:32:58,936 --> 00:33:00,103
That was one of the coolest
things I think I've ever seen

636
00:33:00,105 --> 00:33:01,062
in my life.

637
00:33:01,064 --> 00:33:01,978

'cause you live in Portland.

00:33:04,442 --> 00:33:06,150
You know you need to stop
being so rude about Portland.

- I know.
- Portland is actually

641
00:33:06,986 --> 00:33:07,985
pretty awesome.

fix your pillows

It's so good.

I make movies.

00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:30,509
We'll put that over there.

would happen.

know each other.

00:33:57,077 --> 00:33:57,912
No?

00:34:00,373 --> 00:34:02,789
Well, I did push back
work for you.

Well, you didn't have to, I
thank you.

Yeah, they'll call me when
they need me.

been friends

I'm not that nice
once you get to know me.

674
00:34:18,057 --> 00:34:18,972
Too sensitive?

00:34:18,974 --> 00:34:20,349
Okay.

676
00:34:20,351 --> 00:34:23,061
I just hung out
with bitchy girls

677
00:34:23,063 --> 00:34:25,731
and we made fun of people.

678
00:34:26,940 --> 00:34:27,775
Yeah.

679
00:34:28,777 --> 00:34:31,235
I don't know if you and
I would've been friends.

680
00:34:31,237 --> 00:34:33,528
You know, I went through phases
and stuff,

681
00:34:33,530 --> 00:34:34,988
like a rebellious phase.

682
00:34:34,990 --> 00:34:36,990
Hmm, rebellious how?

683
00:34:36,992 --> 00:34:39,452
I'd sneak out and smoke pot.

Oh!

685
00:34:40,663 --> 00:34:44,206
(GIGGLES) Oh, nothing
wildly original.

686
00:34:44,208 --> 00:34:49,004
But my dad had a camera
and I'd go on long walks

687
00:34:50,255 --> 00:34:51,090
and make movies.

688
00:34:52,634 --> 00:34:54,302
Studied at NYU, right?

689
00:34:56,929 --> 00:34:58,431
That is intimidating (LAUGHS).

go to Tisch

691
00:35:00,307 --> 00:35:02,057
and you turned out fine.

693
00:35:03,103 --> 00:35:04,519
You know, I think you're
more confident

694
00:35:04,521 --> 00:35:05,689
than you think you are.

695
00:35:08,273 --> 00:35:09,315
Thanks?

Your parents, are they
still together?

Oh, yeah.

699
00:35:17,324 --> 00:35:20,327
There are no divorces
in the Graham family.

700
00:35:21,996 --> 00:35:23,664
SYDNEY: Yeah, but should
there be?

701
00:35:25,000 --> 00:35:26,999
They annoy the fuck out of
each other,

702
00:35:27,001 --> 00:35:28,168
but they stay together.

703
00:35:29,461 --> 00:35:30,463
It's a lost art.

704
00:35:32,590 --> 00:35:33,550
Do you want that?

705
00:35:39,472 --> 00:35:43,727
I want to not go on so many
first dates.

00:35:45,228 --> 00:35:49,146
You know, I get tired of
giving the same information

707
00:35:49,148 --> 00:35:51,525
about myself to
different people.

00:35:52,985 --> 00:35:54,193
Gets old.

709
00:35:54,195 --> 00:35:55,528
Yeah.

710
00:35:55,530 --> 00:35:57,487
Yeah, I don't, I don't really
think people

711
00:35:57,489 --> 00:36:01,159
wanna settle down
anymore though, you know.

712
00:36:01,161 --> 00:36:03,452
There's too may options.

713
00:36:03,454 --> 00:36:06,206
Hmm, enough to keep
you busy for a lifetime.

714
00:36:07,791 --> 00:36:10,836
A lifetime of swiping
left and right.

715
00:36:15,342 --> 00:36:18,219
I don't think people know
how to be happy anymore.

716
00:36:21,681 --> 00:36:22,766
Well, are you happy?

00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:30,898
I don't know.

00:36:54,713 --> 00:36:56,046

And remember this is
the honesty bed.

787

I would go to the
nearest interstate

788
00:40:31,389 --> 00:40:33,097
and find an overpass

789
00:40:33,099 --> 00:40:37,187

to the 35th floor

over 35 is overkill.

morning, mid-morning,

794
00:40:50,992 --> 00:40:53,825
or early afternoon around
that time when it's

795

796
00:40:55,704 --> 00:40:57,706

to get somewhere.

00:40:58,875 --> 00:41:00,126
