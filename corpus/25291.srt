1
00:01:22,177 --> 00:01:24,904
10-86, possible 4- 17. Baker, Henry.

2
00:01:25,111 --> 00:01:28,009
3000 block ofBagley, 4- 17, 10-30.

3
00:01:29,677 --> 00:01:30,643
Get back!

4
00:01:30,844 --> 00:01:32,310
-I'II shoot her!
-Oh, my God!

5
00:01:32,511 --> 00:01:34,101
3-L-90. I repeat:

6
00:01:34,311 --> 00:01:37,765
3-L-90, request you notify hostage
negotiation team.

7
00:01:37,977 --> 00:01:40,375
Have them respond to my Iocation.

8
00:01:45,877 --> 00:01:48,275
-See anything?
-Get those cars out of here!

9
00:01:50,211 --> 00:01:53,404
Suspect is a maIe Caucasian,
approximateIy--

10
00:01:53,610 --> 00:01:55,667
I'm a reporter.
How Iong have you been here?

11
00:01:56,544 --> 00:01:58,976
Domestic or drugs?
Is that his girIfriend?

12
00:01:59,177 --> 00:02:00,870
-Get out of here.
-Who is it?

13
00:02:01,077 --> 00:02:02,633
-TaIk to me.
-Get him out of here.

14
00:02:03,244 --> 00:02:04,903
-Go on!
-I got my passes.

15
00:02:05,577 --> 00:02:07,406
-Shit.
-I have every right to be here.

16
00:02:07,610 --> 00:02:09,076
Where'd he go?

17
00:02:09,577 --> 00:02:12,737
Suspect has withdrawn into
the interior of the room.

18
00:02:12,944 --> 00:02:15,307
We no Ionger have visuaI contact.

19
00:02:31,410 --> 00:02:33,535
That was my car.

20
00:03:01,910 --> 00:03:03,240
HoIy--

21
00:03:13,243 --> 00:03:15,300
Having a IittIe car troubIe?

22
00:03:18,809 --> 00:03:20,672
That's a keen observation.

23
00:03:21,210 --> 00:03:22,800
I can heIp you.

24
00:03:25,143 --> 00:03:26,200
It's the Jag.

25
00:03:27,776 --> 00:03:29,969
You want me to drive home in your car?

26
00:03:30,176 --> 00:03:31,903
I want you to take my car.

27
00:03:33,509 --> 00:03:36,032
I've had a Iot of Iuck IateIy.
I don't need it.

28
00:03:36,676 --> 00:03:39,335
You're giving me a new Jaguar
and you don't want anything?

29
00:03:39,543 --> 00:03:42,169
I can prove it. Give me your card.

30
00:03:52,943 --> 00:03:54,238
I'II be in touch.

31
00:03:54,442 --> 00:03:57,306
What, you want me to kiII your
wife or something?

32
00:03:57,543 --> 00:03:58,531
No.

33
00:03:58,743 --> 00:04:00,572
Tempting, but, no.

34
00:04:00,776 --> 00:04:03,571
CaII it generosity between
two strangers.

35
00:04:05,075 --> 00:04:07,837
Generosity? It's a Jaguar.

36
00:04:08,042 --> 00:04:10,600
You expect me to drive home
in a new Jaguar?

37
00:04:10,809 --> 00:04:13,104
-That's right.
-You're a freak!

38
00:04:13,309 --> 00:04:14,605
You are a freak.

39
00:04:14,809 --> 00:04:18,366
You want me to get in this car? No way!
It'II probabIy bIow up.

40
00:04:18,576 --> 00:04:21,905
That's reaI funny, bits and pieces of me
raining down in the street!

41
00:04:23,276 --> 00:04:26,140
You think I'm going near that thing,
you're nuts!

42
00:04:26,409 --> 00:04:28,170
Besides, I got a car.

43
00:04:30,709 --> 00:04:32,231
Sort of.

44
00:05:27,009 --> 00:05:28,372
What? You Iike it?

45
00:05:28,842 --> 00:05:29,899
CooI bIade, huh?

46
00:05:30,109 --> 00:05:33,098
-You want to see it?
-IKeep it in your pants.

47
00:05:34,675 --> 00:05:35,936
Fag.

48
00:05:36,608 --> 00:05:39,631
-He's gonna kiII you.
-I've got pepper spray.

49
00:06:26,375 --> 00:06:29,829
ApparentIy, none of you have ever
seen a new teacher before.

50
00:06:31,807 --> 00:06:33,034
I'm Mr. Simonet.

51
00:06:33,774 --> 00:06:35,603
WeIcome to the seventh grade.

52
00:06:35,807 --> 00:06:40,297
MiddIe schooI, that heIIish, shaky
bridge you aII must cross...

53
00:06:40,541 --> 00:06:45,474
...before you become members of that
undyingIy enviabIe high schooI eIite.

54
00:06:45,908 --> 00:06:48,874
You may think you can't cross
this bridge fast enough.

55
00:06:49,074 --> 00:06:54,006
You'd rather cIose your eyes and not
think about it untiI it's aII over.

56
00:06:54,407 --> 00:06:56,737
WeII, I'm here to teII you...

57
00:06:56,941 --> 00:06:59,736
...that is not an option
in this cIass.

58
00:07:01,574 --> 00:07:02,801
Lateness.

59
00:07:05,374 --> 00:07:06,635
Tardiness.

60
00:07:06,841 --> 00:07:10,466
To be Iate for your first cIass
on your first day of schooI.

61
00:07:10,674 --> 00:07:12,572
What does that indicate?

62
00:07:13,574 --> 00:07:15,563
I'm having a bad hair day?

63
00:07:16,807 --> 00:07:19,830
Perhaps what it indicates is
a Iack of respect.

64
00:07:20,041 --> 00:07:23,370
You see, I'm going to be here
every day for you.

65
00:07:23,574 --> 00:07:27,802
And so I expect you to be here for me.

66
00:07:28,307 --> 00:07:31,034
On time, no excuses.

67
00:07:31,874 --> 00:07:32,703
Put that down.

68
00:07:33,607 --> 00:07:34,470
Wait.

69
00:07:37,007 --> 00:07:38,132
Now...

70
00:07:39,173 --> 00:07:42,037
...this cIass is sociaI studies.

71
00:07:42,340 --> 00:07:46,102
That is you and the worId. Yes.

72
00:07:46,307 --> 00:07:50,399
There is a worId out there and even if
you don't want to meet it...

73
00:07:50,607 --> 00:07:54,061
...it's stiII going to hit you
right in the face.

74
00:07:54,707 --> 00:07:55,933
BeIieve me.

75
00:07:57,607 --> 00:08:01,562
Best start thinking about the worId
now and what it means to you.

76
00:08:03,007 --> 00:08:06,633
What does the worId mean to you?

77
00:08:08,507 --> 00:08:10,370
Come on! A IittIe cIass
participation.

78
00:08:10,574 --> 00:08:12,698
Is it just this cIass you
want to get out of?

79
00:08:12,907 --> 00:08:14,668
Your house, your street?

80
00:08:14,873 --> 00:08:18,465
Any further any of you want to go
than that? Yes?

81
00:08:18,740 --> 00:08:21,638
The maII. That's onIy two miIes
away from me.

82
00:08:23,773 --> 00:08:25,830
Let me ask you another question.

83
00:08:26,173 --> 00:08:30,401
How often do you think about things
that happen outside of this town?

84
00:08:30,640 --> 00:08:34,038
Do you watch the news? Yes? No?

85
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:38,229
AII right, so we're not gIobaI thinkers
yet, but why aren't we?

86
00:08:40,140 --> 00:08:42,038
Because we're 1 1 .

87
00:08:42,706 --> 00:08:44,229
Good point. What's your name?

88
00:08:44,940 --> 00:08:45,769
Trevor.

89
00:08:45,973 --> 00:08:49,030
Maybe Trevor's right. Why shouId
we think about the worId?

90
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:52,694
After aII, what does the worId
expect of us?

91
00:08:53,073 --> 00:08:54,299
Expect?

92
00:08:54,540 --> 00:08:55,403
Of you.

93
00:08:55,973 --> 00:08:59,427
What does the worId expect of you?

94
00:09:00,973 --> 00:09:02,064
Nothing.

95
00:09:03,640 --> 00:09:04,970
Nothing.

96
00:09:05,773 --> 00:09:08,204
My God, boys and girIs, he's right.

97
00:09:08,439 --> 00:09:09,666
Nothing.

98
00:09:10,206 --> 00:09:12,570
Here you are. You can't drive.
You can't vote.

99
00:09:12,773 --> 00:09:16,068
You can't go to the bathroom
without a pass. You're stuck...

100
00:09:16,806 --> 00:09:19,067
...right here in the seventh grade.

101
00:09:22,540 --> 00:09:23,870
But not forever...

102
00:09:24,506 --> 00:09:27,233
...because one day you'II be free.

103
00:09:31,606 --> 00:09:34,265
But what if on that day you're free...

104
00:09:34,673 --> 00:09:37,161
...you haven't prepared,
you're not ready...

105
00:09:37,373 --> 00:09:41,896
...and yet you Iook around you
and you don't Iike what the worId is.

106
00:09:42,106 --> 00:09:44,004
What if the worId...

107
00:09:44,839 --> 00:09:47,533
...is just a big disappointment?

108
00:09:48,273 --> 00:09:49,738
We're screwed.

109
00:09:50,006 --> 00:09:51,529
UnIess....

110
00:09:52,805 --> 00:09:56,828
UnIess you take the things that you
don't Iike about this worId...

111
00:09:57,072 --> 00:10:00,197
...and you fIip them upside down right
on their ass.

112
00:10:00,406 --> 00:10:02,735
Don't teII your parents I
used that word.

113
00:10:03,139 --> 00:10:05,298
And you can start that...

114
00:10:05,839 --> 00:10:07,135
...today.

115
00:10:08,505 --> 00:10:11,404
This is your assignment.

116
00:10:11,639 --> 00:10:12,730
Extra credit.

117
00:10:12,939 --> 00:10:16,269
It goes on aII year Iong.

118
00:10:18,672 --> 00:10:20,968
Wait a minute.
What's wrong with this?

119
00:10:21,172 --> 00:10:22,899
What's the matter? Yes?

120
00:10:23,405 --> 00:10:24,928
It's, Iike, so....

121
00:10:26,405 --> 00:10:28,564
There must be a word to finish
that sentence.

122
00:10:28,805 --> 00:10:30,101
-Someone heIp her.
-Weird.

123
00:10:30,305 --> 00:10:31,532
Weird. Crazy.

124
00:10:31,739 --> 00:10:32,568
Hard.

125
00:10:32,772 --> 00:10:34,533
-Bummer.
-Bummer.

126
00:10:34,739 --> 00:10:36,398
Hard.

127
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:41,566
How about possibIe?

128
00:10:43,772 --> 00:10:45,465
It's possibIe.

129
00:10:47,405 --> 00:10:50,166
The reaIm of possibiIity...

130
00:10:50,805 --> 00:10:54,965
...exists where? In each of you.

131
00:10:57,405 --> 00:10:58,632
Here.

132
00:10:59,971 --> 00:11:01,960
So you can do it.

133
00:11:02,639 --> 00:11:05,867
You can surprise us. It's up to you.

134
00:11:06,572 --> 00:11:10,561
Or you can just sit back
and Iet it atrophy.

135
00:11:12,405 --> 00:11:13,735
Atrophy.

136
00:11:14,805 --> 00:11:18,998
If there is a word you hear that you
don't understand, there's a dictionary.

137
00:11:19,238 --> 00:11:20,568
Look it up.

138
00:11:20,871 --> 00:11:24,735
And there are these dictionaries which
you wiII carry at aII times...

139
00:11:24,971 --> 00:11:28,563
...because in this cIass, we're going
to Iearn to Iove words...

140
00:11:29,305 --> 00:11:31,827
...and their meanings.
Any questions?

141
00:11:32,305 --> 00:11:33,464
Yeah.

142
00:11:33,971 --> 00:11:37,529
So, you'II Iike, fIunk us if we
don't change the worId?

143
00:11:38,205 --> 00:11:40,068
No, I wouIdn't do that.

144
00:11:40,971 --> 00:11:43,994
But you might just squeak by
with a ''C''.

145
00:11:48,105 --> 00:11:50,037
What'd you ever do to change
the worId?

146
00:11:54,704 --> 00:11:56,966
WeII, Trevor, I get a good
night's sIeep.

147
00:11:57,205 --> 00:11:58,966
I eat a hearty breakfast.

148
00:11:59,205 --> 00:12:02,228
I show up on time...

149
00:12:03,971 --> 00:12:06,402
...and then I pass the buck to you.

150
00:12:09,905 --> 00:12:13,701
Now, I want you aII to write your names
in these books and--

151
00:12:13,905 --> 00:12:15,132
What's your name?

152
00:12:15,471 --> 00:12:17,630
MoIIy, aII right. I want MoIIy to
Iook up the word atrophy...

153
00:12:20,371 --> 00:12:22,303
...and teII the cIass what it means.

154
00:15:31,802 --> 00:15:34,859
No, we're not in MiIwaukee.

155
00:15:36,235 --> 00:15:38,202
Straight to heII. Straight to heII.

156
00:15:38,402 --> 00:15:40,732
Four tequiIas.
Who's having the fourth one?

157
00:15:40,969 --> 00:15:43,060
-You are.
-Not for me, thank you.

158
00:15:43,302 --> 00:15:46,894
-We bought it for you.
-Thank you so much. No thanks.

159
00:15:47,103 --> 00:15:48,898
-Why not?
-I promised my kid.

160
00:15:49,435 --> 00:15:52,401
I know, it's horribIe.
You guys have fun.

161
00:15:52,602 --> 00:15:54,124
Wait, wait, wait. Here.

162
00:15:54,369 --> 00:15:55,357
Thank you.

163
00:15:55,569 --> 00:15:57,865
What are you doing, Junior?

164
00:15:58,469 --> 00:16:00,935
What are your doing, Jun?
What are you doing?

165
00:16:01,135 --> 00:16:02,795
You got her now. You got her now.

166
00:16:03,035 --> 00:16:05,194
You got him now. You got him now.

167
00:16:07,035 --> 00:16:08,626
What time do you get off?

168
00:16:08,869 --> 00:16:10,630
If onIy I weren't married.

169
00:16:13,235 --> 00:16:14,860
He's married!

170
00:16:15,335 --> 00:16:17,801
I'm singIe! I'm singIe!

171
00:16:36,202 --> 00:16:38,100
-HeIIo?
-Hey.

172
00:16:40,801 --> 00:16:41,994
How'd it go?

173
00:16:42,202 --> 00:16:43,861
Are you there?
-Yeah.

174
00:16:44,068 --> 00:16:45,534
How'd it go?

175
00:16:45,801 --> 00:16:46,767
What?

176
00:16:47,035 --> 00:16:49,126
How'd it go?
How was your first day?

177
00:16:49,369 --> 00:16:50,392
Okay.

178
00:16:50,635 --> 00:16:53,863
Trev, you got to speak up.
I can't hear you.

179
00:16:54,302 --> 00:16:59,030
Sorry I wasn't home. I had
a chance to pick up another shift.

180
00:17:00,302 --> 00:17:01,699
You mad at me?

181
00:17:04,968 --> 00:17:06,558
Trev, what are you doing?

182
00:17:06,968 --> 00:17:08,298
Nothing.

183
00:17:09,301 --> 00:17:10,528
You find the spaghetti?

184
00:17:13,468 --> 00:17:14,866
I'm eating it.

185
00:17:15,202 --> 00:17:16,190
Good.

186
00:17:16,701 --> 00:17:18,065
Come on, tell me what happened.

187
00:17:18,301 --> 00:17:19,631
I got to go.

188
00:17:30,201 --> 00:17:31,462
Spoon?

189
00:17:32,035 --> 00:17:33,227
Spoon.

190
00:21:55,032 --> 00:21:56,328
Mom?

191
00:21:57,832 --> 00:21:59,059
Mom!

192
00:22:01,598 --> 00:22:04,258
My friend's coming in to
take a shower, okay?

193
00:22:04,865 --> 00:22:06,126
Okay.

194
00:22:26,565 --> 00:22:28,428
That's not reaIIy breakfast.

195
00:22:29,765 --> 00:22:31,230
You don't eat breakfast.

196
00:22:31,431 --> 00:22:32,658
WeII, Iet's have some.

197
00:22:32,865 --> 00:22:35,922
I'II make some eggs.
I'II have some too.

198
00:22:38,632 --> 00:22:40,359
You sure you won't throw up?

199
00:22:41,431 --> 00:22:43,659
-What's that mean?
-What do you think?

200
00:22:43,865 --> 00:22:45,023
TeII me what it means.

201
00:22:45,231 --> 00:22:47,595
-You're sneaking it.
-I'm not sneaking anything.

202
00:22:47,798 --> 00:22:48,889
Okay.

203
00:22:51,231 --> 00:22:53,220
Wait, I'm sorry. You're right.

204
00:22:53,431 --> 00:22:56,056
-I want to taIk.
-You want to Iie to me.

205
00:22:56,265 --> 00:22:58,197
I don't want to Iie, I want to taIk.

206
00:22:58,398 --> 00:23:00,261
-Do what you want.
-I want us to get aIong.

207
00:23:00,465 --> 00:23:01,453
I'm sorry.

208
00:23:01,665 --> 00:23:03,494
I can't find the toiIet paper.

209
00:23:03,931 --> 00:23:05,090
-Who are you?
-It's Jerry.

210
00:23:05,298 --> 00:23:07,230
Get out! Get out of my house!

211
00:23:07,431 --> 00:23:08,522
-Thanks a Iot.
-Get out!

212
00:23:08,732 --> 00:23:11,095
-Do you need money for the bus?
-No, I got it.

213
00:23:11,431 --> 00:23:12,953
You said he couId take a shower.

214
00:23:13,164 --> 00:23:14,562
-I never said that!
-You did.

215
00:23:14,764 --> 00:23:16,855
I said to Iet a strange man
into my bathroom?

216
00:23:17,064 --> 00:23:18,689
He's my friend.

217
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,489
You can't have a friend Iike that.

218
00:23:20,731 --> 00:23:22,856
-It's for my assignment.
-What assignment?

219
00:23:23,064 --> 00:23:25,791
You won't get it.
Mr. Simonet wiII get it.

220
00:23:25,998 --> 00:23:28,555
Who's Mr. Simonet?
Hey, I'm taIking--

221
00:23:28,764 --> 00:23:30,627
He's my teacher.

222
00:23:57,898 --> 00:23:58,886
Mr. Simonet?

223
00:23:59,098 --> 00:24:01,222
Yes, I'm Eugene...

224
00:24:01,764 --> 00:24:03,252
...Simonet.

225
00:24:06,264 --> 00:24:08,560
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

226
00:24:10,230 --> 00:24:12,788
-What is this assignment?
-Excuse me?

227
00:24:12,998 --> 00:24:15,691
What did you say for my son to
Iet a homeIess man in my house?

228
00:24:18,197 --> 00:24:19,663
I have two probIems.

229
00:24:19,898 --> 00:24:22,125
One, I've no idea what
you're taIking about...

230
00:24:22,330 --> 00:24:23,990
...and two, I don't know who you are.

231
00:24:24,197 --> 00:24:27,993
ArIene McIKinney. My boy is in your
sociaI studies cIass? Trevor?

232
00:24:28,997 --> 00:24:30,361
Trevor.

233
00:24:30,564 --> 00:24:34,621
Yes, he's very attentive. He's very
exigent, which I Iike.

234
00:24:36,264 --> 00:24:38,492
-Exigent. ChaIIenging, testing.
-I know what it means.

235
00:24:38,697 --> 00:24:41,060
Why did my kid bring a bum home?

236
00:24:41,264 --> 00:24:42,525
-I have no idea.
-BuIIshit!

237
00:24:42,731 --> 00:24:44,821
I don't know how he interpreted
the assignment.

238
00:24:45,030 --> 00:24:47,553
How do you think he interpreted it?

239
00:24:47,930 --> 00:24:48,918
I don't know.

240
00:24:49,130 --> 00:24:52,290
If you want to know, why don't you
taIk to your son?

241
00:24:52,497 --> 00:24:53,485
I taIk to him.

242
00:24:53,696 --> 00:24:54,855
ReaIIy?

243
00:24:55,063 --> 00:24:59,052
Then why did you come down here to ask
me what the assignment is?

244
00:25:00,897 --> 00:25:02,658
It's not a state secret.

245
00:25:05,930 --> 00:25:07,691
Yeah? And?

246
00:25:09,397 --> 00:25:12,692
It's an assignment I give out at the
beginning of every year to inspire.

247
00:25:12,897 --> 00:25:14,760
I don't expect them to change the worId.

248
00:25:14,963 --> 00:25:16,986
-You don't expect them to change--
-Excuse me.

249
00:25:17,230 --> 00:25:20,128
It's to get them to think,
not waIk on water.

250
00:25:20,330 --> 00:25:23,420
An assignment they can't do?
What kind of teacher are you?

251
00:25:23,630 --> 00:25:25,459
I didn't say that.
They make attempts.

252
00:25:25,663 --> 00:25:27,993
Now and then they cIean up graffiti--

253
00:25:28,230 --> 00:25:30,661
This is my kid. You don't know him.

254
00:25:31,963 --> 00:25:34,156
TeII him he can do something,
he'II beIieve you.

255
00:25:34,396 --> 00:25:36,726
And when he can't, it'II wipe him out.

256
00:25:36,930 --> 00:25:39,828
They ought to fire your ass
out of here right now.

257
00:25:41,296 --> 00:25:45,024
They probabIy won't do that because I
fiIIed a very exceIIent quota.

258
00:25:45,229 --> 00:25:47,991
I'm just this side of parking in
the bIue zone.

259
00:25:48,196 --> 00:25:52,424
You think you can do whatever you want
because your face is messed up?

260
00:25:53,897 --> 00:25:57,989
Why don't you put down in writing your
IittIe and Ioud compIaints...

261
00:25:58,196 --> 00:26:01,492
...and I'II make sure they get put
in the suggestion box.

262
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,255
Jesus.

263
00:26:06,863 --> 00:26:08,522
You are reaIIy something.

264
00:26:08,730 --> 00:26:11,628
Thanks. I appreciate the euphemism.

265
00:26:11,830 --> 00:26:13,887
I've aIways wanted to be something.

266
00:26:21,196 --> 00:26:23,355
Can I heIp you with something, miss?

267
00:26:24,196 --> 00:26:25,492
No.

268
00:26:36,329 --> 00:26:40,318
Mr. Thorsen. HoId up, man!
I've been waiting aII day for you.

269
00:26:40,530 --> 00:26:43,654
-Why won't you return my caIIs?
-We're not friends.

270
00:26:43,862 --> 00:26:46,589
I got the pink sIip for the car.
Quite a stocking stuffer.

271
00:26:46,795 --> 00:26:49,625
-You can't accept it?
-No, that wouId make me a moron.

272
00:26:49,829 --> 00:26:52,091
I just want to know about
these instructions.

273
00:26:52,296 --> 00:26:53,989
Do what they say. Pay it forward.

274
00:26:54,196 --> 00:26:56,094
-Why?
-Because you've accepted the car.

275
00:26:56,296 --> 00:26:59,489
-You're obIigated.
-What if I don't feeI obIigated?

276
00:26:59,695 --> 00:27:02,718
What if I take my new car, get some
hookers and drive to Mexico?

277
00:27:02,929 --> 00:27:03,952
I'II never know.

278
00:27:04,162 --> 00:27:06,389
What is this? Come on, for reaI.

279
00:27:06,595 --> 00:27:09,084
An attack of totaI aItruism
from a Iitigator.

280
00:27:09,296 --> 00:27:10,522
I've got a meeting.

281
00:27:10,729 --> 00:27:12,888
I've got a story. Okay?

282
00:27:13,096 --> 00:27:15,527
A partner at Channing and Moss
is giving away cars?

283
00:27:15,762 --> 00:27:19,319
TeII me a reason or I'II make one up.
Mine wiII be more interesting.

284
00:27:19,529 --> 00:27:23,427
You've gone dotty, you're wearing
crystaIs, keeping too many cats at home?

285
00:27:25,428 --> 00:27:26,985
Look. Listen, pIease!

286
00:27:27,195 --> 00:27:29,252
My ex-wife has everything. Okay?

287
00:27:29,462 --> 00:27:32,690
PIus, she's in a Iesbian reIationship
just to piss me off.

288
00:27:32,929 --> 00:27:34,918
HeIp me out, pIease.

289
00:27:39,495 --> 00:27:41,461
My daughter has asthma.

290
00:27:41,762 --> 00:27:45,489
One night it was very bad,
the worst I'd ever seen it.

291
00:27:45,695 --> 00:27:48,661
It was the middle of the night,
emergency room.

292
00:27:49,161 --> 00:27:52,650
We were waiting forever.
Couldn't get anyone to pay attention.

293
00:28:02,161 --> 00:28:04,252
Her inhaIer doesn't seem
to be working.

294
00:28:04,462 --> 00:28:06,018
Mr. Parker, what happened?

295
00:28:06,228 --> 00:28:08,524
My sister, she stabbed me.

296
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:10,956
-We were here first.
-Stab wounds first.

297
00:28:11,161 --> 00:28:13,718
-She can't breathe. She's scared.
-I wiII Iet you know.

298
00:28:13,928 --> 00:28:15,656
Somebody has to see her.

299
00:28:15,928 --> 00:28:18,394
It's never been this bad.
Do something.

300
00:28:18,595 --> 00:28:20,151
WouId you just sit down?

301
00:28:20,362 --> 00:28:24,158
I'm sorry. We've been here 4 hours.
You need to get a doctor.

302
00:28:24,362 --> 00:28:25,850
No. Wait.

303
00:28:28,861 --> 00:28:30,418
That's buIIshit.
HeIp her right now.

304
00:28:30,628 --> 00:28:32,492
-Excuse me?
-Why you giving me shit?

305
00:28:32,694 --> 00:28:33,921
Ain't you got some oxygen?

306
00:28:34,128 --> 00:28:35,389
Let me get the supervisor.

307
00:28:35,594 --> 00:28:38,220
You don't need a supervisor.
You the supervisor today.

308
00:28:38,428 --> 00:28:41,484
You are the supervisor today.
You feeI me on that?

309
00:28:41,694 --> 00:28:45,592
Take your ass down the haII, put the
girI on the tray and supervise her...

310
00:28:45,794 --> 00:28:48,419
...and get her some goddamn air.

311
00:28:48,928 --> 00:28:52,587
I got your back, sis. Bitch, you're
stiII here. Shit!

312
00:28:55,694 --> 00:28:58,455
Let go of my arm, man.
This ain't fair, man!

313
00:28:58,794 --> 00:29:01,158
Come on! Come on, man. Damn!

314
00:29:01,361 --> 00:29:02,793
I thanked him...

315
00:29:03,095 --> 00:29:07,459
...and there were specifiic orifiices in
which I was told to shove my thanks.

316
00:29:07,661 --> 00:29:09,718
He toId me, ''Just pay it forward.''

317
00:29:09,928 --> 00:29:12,587
Three big favors for three other
peopIe. That's it.

318
00:29:12,794 --> 00:29:14,987
So it's Iike a pass-it-on thing, then.

319
00:29:15,194 --> 00:29:17,717
You and this IowIife are in this chain
of do-gooders...

320
00:29:17,928 --> 00:29:21,451
...a kind of Mother Teresa conga Iine?
That's a IittIe New-Agey for you.

321
00:29:21,661 --> 00:29:24,286
Sort of Tibetan? Are you in a cuIt?

322
00:29:25,194 --> 00:29:29,388
Mention my name, you'II be seIIing your
kidneys to pay for your Iawsuit.

323
00:29:29,594 --> 00:29:30,924
CuIt.

324
00:29:31,461 --> 00:29:33,949
The guy! What was the guy's name?

325
00:29:34,160 --> 00:29:36,854
Sorry, I'm Iate for my mass wedding.

326
00:30:06,094 --> 00:30:08,083
I know somebody's in here.

327
00:30:10,827 --> 00:30:12,453
I know you're there.

328
00:30:13,261 --> 00:30:16,022
Come out or I wiII find you
and shoot you.

329
00:30:16,227 --> 00:30:17,988
PIease don't shoot.

330
00:30:20,327 --> 00:30:21,519
PIease.

331
00:30:22,027 --> 00:30:23,686
You stay right there.

332
00:30:24,094 --> 00:30:27,083
If I see you move one--

333
00:30:32,994 --> 00:30:34,357
PIease don't pick it up!

334
00:30:34,560 --> 00:30:36,822
PIease don't! I'm not moving.

335
00:30:38,760 --> 00:30:40,021
PIease.

336
00:30:42,660 --> 00:30:44,523
What are you doing to my truck?

337
00:30:46,027 --> 00:30:48,549
Let me show you. I'm just....

338
00:30:48,960 --> 00:30:51,085
I'm just going to open the door, okay?

339
00:31:01,860 --> 00:31:02,826
See?

340
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:07,852
Might be easier for you to seII now.
Now that it works.

341
00:31:08,093 --> 00:31:09,923
I didn't ask for your heIp.

342
00:31:10,760 --> 00:31:12,589
You been Iiving in my garage?

343
00:31:12,793 --> 00:31:15,258
Not after tonight.
Can I come around and....

344
00:31:16,926 --> 00:31:20,290
I got a handyman job at the RoyaI MoteI.
They're giving me a room.

345
00:31:20,493 --> 00:31:21,856
You stay right there!

346
00:31:22,093 --> 00:31:24,252
PIease, I don't Iike guns.

347
00:31:25,693 --> 00:31:28,181
What is going on with you and my son?

348
00:31:28,426 --> 00:31:29,857
He wanted to heIp somebody.

349
00:31:30,093 --> 00:31:34,025
Wanted to get somebody back on their
feet, so he gave me a IittIe money.

350
00:31:34,260 --> 00:31:36,658
-He gave you money?
-Yes, ma'am.

351
00:31:36,993 --> 00:31:38,619
That's his savings.

352
00:31:40,159 --> 00:31:43,284
WeII, it's cIothes and shoes
and I got the job off it.

353
00:31:45,093 --> 00:31:46,820
You think you can keep it?

354
00:31:47,193 --> 00:31:50,091
Looks to me Iike you've got yourseIf
a IittIe probIem.

355
00:31:54,792 --> 00:31:56,258
I can Iick it.

356
00:31:56,926 --> 00:31:59,290
How's that supposed to happen
aII of a sudden?

357
00:31:59,826 --> 00:32:01,689
You ever been on the street?

358
00:32:04,260 --> 00:32:06,249
My mom took us pretty cIose.

359
00:32:06,826 --> 00:32:10,622
WeII, you can't know, not untiI
you're Iooking at a dumpster.

360
00:32:11,425 --> 00:32:16,357
But when you cIimb in the first time,
and puII the newspapers over you...

361
00:32:16,659 --> 00:32:20,318
...that's when you know you've
messed your Iife up.

362
00:32:20,926 --> 00:32:25,381
Somebody comes aIong Iike your son
and gives me a Ieg up...

363
00:32:26,292 --> 00:32:27,758
...I'II take it.

364
00:32:28,159 --> 00:32:30,317
Even from a kid, I'II take it.

365
00:32:35,626 --> 00:32:38,285
I can't mess up again or I'II be dead.

366
00:32:39,859 --> 00:32:42,654
I appreciate that you're trying to pay
back Trevor--

367
00:32:42,859 --> 00:32:44,848
I'm not aIIowed to pay back Trevor.

368
00:32:45,092 --> 00:32:48,650
-Then what is it you're doing?
-I'm paying it forward.

369
00:32:51,092 --> 00:32:52,955
I know you want me to go.

370
00:32:55,125 --> 00:32:56,284
I'II go.

371
00:32:58,659 --> 00:33:00,591
What's paying it forward?

372
00:33:01,626 --> 00:33:03,148
That's me.

373
00:33:04,892 --> 00:33:07,824
And that's three peopIe.

374
00:33:10,259 --> 00:33:14,658
And I'm going to heIp them, but it has
to be something reaIIy big...

375
00:33:15,892 --> 00:33:19,824
...something they can't do
by themseIves.

376
00:33:20,325 --> 00:33:22,291
So I do it for them...

377
00:33:23,691 --> 00:33:26,782
...then they do it for
three other peopIe.

378
00:33:28,791 --> 00:33:30,382
That's nine.

379
00:33:31,058 --> 00:33:34,581
And I do three more....

380
00:33:34,791 --> 00:33:37,814
That's 27, so--

381
00:33:38,058 --> 00:33:42,581
I'm not reaIIy good at math but it
gets big reaIIy fast. You know?

382
00:33:48,591 --> 00:33:50,217
AII right, aII right, aII right.

383
00:33:50,424 --> 00:33:52,084
A IittIe articuIation, pIease.

384
00:33:52,292 --> 00:33:54,315
-Yes?
-I think it's a good idea.

385
00:33:54,525 --> 00:33:56,457
-Shawn?
-It's stupid.

386
00:33:56,658 --> 00:33:57,988
-Adam?
-It's the honor system.

387
00:33:58,458 --> 00:34:00,515
-PeopIe bIow off the honor system.
-So what?

388
00:34:00,725 --> 00:34:02,486
Just because you do.

389
00:34:03,158 --> 00:34:07,852
Trevor, the cIass thinks that you've
come up with an overIy utopian idea.

390
00:34:08,058 --> 00:34:09,990
Look that word up in a minute.

391
00:34:12,291 --> 00:34:14,257
Like a perfect worId?

392
00:34:17,858 --> 00:34:19,153
So?

393
00:34:21,291 --> 00:34:25,417
So what put this idea in your head?

394
00:34:28,825 --> 00:34:29,756
Because....

395
00:34:29,958 --> 00:34:32,924
Everything sucks.

396
00:34:34,091 --> 00:34:35,523
He taIked to you about this?

397
00:34:36,091 --> 00:34:38,284
We've had our discussions.

398
00:34:40,057 --> 00:34:41,785
But you don't have to worry...

399
00:34:41,991 --> 00:34:45,151
...because I'II teII him we
can't taIk no more.

400
00:34:47,091 --> 00:34:48,614
No, don't do that.

401
00:34:50,725 --> 00:34:52,213
WouId you Iike a cup of coffee?

402
00:34:55,491 --> 00:34:56,479
Yes, ma'am.

403
00:34:56,691 --> 00:34:58,156
Okay.

404
00:35:07,258 --> 00:35:10,383
I called the president
to talk aboutpollution.

405
00:35:10,590 --> 00:35:13,216
But my mom said now they'II
put us on some Iist...

406
00:35:13,424 --> 00:35:15,049
...so she hung up.

407
00:35:15,458 --> 00:35:19,719
For this assignment, I put up recycIing
fIiers at two supermarkets.

408
00:35:19,924 --> 00:35:21,719
I'm going to put up a website
in Chinese.

409
00:35:21,924 --> 00:35:25,322
It'II teII aII the kids in China to jump
up and down at the same time.

410
00:35:32,624 --> 00:35:35,351
The goaI being to knock
the Earth off its axis.

411
00:35:35,590 --> 00:35:36,988
-Yeah.
-Thank you. Sit down.

412
00:35:39,091 --> 00:35:43,183
WeII, your ideas are as surprising
as they are variegated.

413
00:35:43,423 --> 00:35:46,253
Add that to your Iist of words
to Iook up.

414
00:35:46,590 --> 00:35:50,420
But I want to focus for a moment on one
project we heard today.

415
00:35:50,991 --> 00:35:55,923
I've been teaching for many years and
it's the first new idea that aIso...

416
00:35:56,690 --> 00:36:01,486
...requires an extreme act of faith in
the goodness of peopIe.

417
00:36:01,991 --> 00:36:06,719
Trevor has made an attempt to
interact with the worId...

418
00:36:06,924 --> 00:36:08,856
...and that was the assignment.

419
00:36:09,090 --> 00:36:12,988
And if I were an effusive person given
to easy praise...

420
00:36:13,190 --> 00:36:14,884
...I wouId caII that...

421
00:36:15,524 --> 00:36:16,955
...admirabIe.

422
00:36:17,156 --> 00:36:20,179
The words from today:
utopian, enigma, quantum.

423
00:36:20,423 --> 00:36:22,651
Add variegated.
I want you to go home--

424
00:36:27,890 --> 00:36:30,220
-Hey, Mr. Simonet.
-HeIIo.

425
00:36:40,624 --> 00:36:42,453
Were you just being nice?

426
00:36:43,390 --> 00:36:44,617
About what?

427
00:36:45,624 --> 00:36:47,214
About my idea.

428
00:36:47,623 --> 00:36:51,454
Do you think it's good or were you
just being teachery?

429
00:36:52,990 --> 00:36:53,956
Teachery?

430
00:36:55,123 --> 00:36:56,111
BuIIshitting.

431
00:36:58,156 --> 00:37:00,587
Do I strike you as someone
faIseIy nice?

432
00:37:01,357 --> 00:37:02,448
No.

433
00:37:03,223 --> 00:37:05,280
You're not even reaIIy aII that nice.

434
00:37:08,156 --> 00:37:11,986
WeII, it was a sIip-up
and it wiII not happen again.

435
00:37:17,456 --> 00:37:18,581
What?

436
00:37:21,322 --> 00:37:22,879
What happened to your face?

437
00:37:40,256 --> 00:37:42,984
Did you draw the short straw today,
Trevor?

438
00:37:44,489 --> 00:37:47,649
It's not a very pertinent subject to
sociaI studies, is it?

439
00:37:48,089 --> 00:37:49,988
Go and teII them that's
what I said.

440
00:37:50,189 --> 00:37:51,621
TeII who?

441
00:37:51,856 --> 00:37:53,378
I'II see you tomorrow.

442
00:38:18,788 --> 00:38:22,243
-You know where Jerry is?
-Over there in 1 5.

443
00:38:54,122 --> 00:38:55,815
It's more product.

444
00:38:56,022 --> 00:38:57,510
Who is it?

445
00:38:58,189 --> 00:38:59,677
It's Trevor.

446
00:38:59,889 --> 00:39:01,946
I'm Iooking for Jerry.

447
00:39:03,722 --> 00:39:05,517
Jerry's not here.

448
00:39:07,288 --> 00:39:08,811
When wiII he be back?

449
00:39:09,022 --> 00:39:12,852
He's not coming back.
Now get out of here.

450
00:39:18,755 --> 00:39:19,914
Jerry?

451
00:39:20,121 --> 00:39:22,054
Get out of here!

452
00:39:24,288 --> 00:39:26,652
PIease come out, Jerry.

453
00:40:44,287 --> 00:40:48,242
I remember in 1 976 there were those
programs in the schooI system...

454
00:40:48,454 --> 00:40:52,046
-...and now, aII that's gone.
-I gotta go.

455
00:40:54,654 --> 00:40:57,984
You ran out of cIass this morning.
I wanted to taIk to you.

456
00:41:50,820 --> 00:41:52,377
-HeIIo.
-HeIIo.

457
00:41:53,220 --> 00:41:54,277
Come in.

458
00:42:01,354 --> 00:42:03,081
Trevor's not feeIing good.

459
00:42:03,287 --> 00:42:05,479
I'm sorry.
What's the matter?

460
00:42:05,686 --> 00:42:07,152
Just a tummy ache.

461
00:42:07,553 --> 00:42:09,019
Do you want to come in?

462
00:42:09,287 --> 00:42:10,946
Sure. Thank you.

463
00:42:12,786 --> 00:42:15,150
-Sit down.
-Thank you.

464
00:42:16,287 --> 00:42:18,343
-It's a very beautifuI home.
-Thank you.

465
00:42:18,553 --> 00:42:20,485
Have you Iived in Vegas your
whoIe Iife?

466
00:42:20,686 --> 00:42:21,845
Yeah.

467
00:42:28,686 --> 00:42:33,618
I toId him if you wanted to taIk to me
I wouId come to the schooI.

468
00:42:34,786 --> 00:42:37,650
Mrs. McIKinney, I didn't ask to see you.

469
00:42:38,686 --> 00:42:40,379
WeII, Trevor said you did.

470
00:42:41,119 --> 00:42:43,847
Yeah and he gave me a note from you...

471
00:42:45,353 --> 00:42:47,546
...which you didn't write.

472
00:42:47,786 --> 00:42:49,809
He gave you a note from me?

473
00:42:51,987 --> 00:42:55,851
Oh, God, that's horribIe.
He's been so--

474
00:42:56,052 --> 00:42:58,746
-No, I didn't mean you.
-No expIanation required.

475
00:42:58,952 --> 00:43:00,680
-Don't eIaborate.
-It's not personaI.

476
00:43:00,887 --> 00:43:02,853
-I'm used to this.
-WouId you stop?

477
00:43:03,186 --> 00:43:05,675
Can we just rewind here a IittIe bit?

478
00:43:06,286 --> 00:43:11,116
I obviousIy didn't reaIize
how much Trevor Iikes you.

479
00:43:11,620 --> 00:43:14,949
That's nothing that we can't discuss
on parent-teacher night.

480
00:43:15,286 --> 00:43:17,218
Then why did you come?

481
00:43:18,486 --> 00:43:21,714
Why didn't you just teII me to
come to the schooI?

482
00:43:24,785 --> 00:43:27,343
Because you came to the schooI...

483
00:43:28,353 --> 00:43:30,114
...to taIk to me about your son...

484
00:43:30,819 --> 00:43:32,785
...and I behaved Iike a--

485
00:43:32,986 --> 00:43:34,282
An asshoIe?

486
00:43:36,119 --> 00:43:37,210
Sorry.

487
00:43:38,119 --> 00:43:40,051
Is that too traiIer-trash a word?

488
00:43:42,052 --> 00:43:44,245
How's ''rat bastard'' sit with you?

489
00:43:44,453 --> 00:43:45,316
It's pretty good.

490
00:43:46,186 --> 00:43:47,811
-''Dickhead''?
-Oh, I Iike that.

491
00:43:51,219 --> 00:43:52,445
Look, I'm--

492
00:44:06,285 --> 00:44:08,478
I made aII this food.

493
00:44:09,652 --> 00:44:11,379
It's just sitting here.

494
00:44:15,886 --> 00:44:18,716
I reaIIy don't know who eIse to
taIk to about him.

495
00:44:21,485 --> 00:44:23,883
-This is good.
-Thanks.

496
00:44:24,118 --> 00:44:26,346
I don't understand.
This is summer schooI?

497
00:44:27,986 --> 00:44:30,451
Why do you think Trevor stopped
taIking to you?

498
00:44:30,652 --> 00:44:32,049
I don't know.

499
00:44:32,952 --> 00:44:34,611
He seems mad.

500
00:44:35,685 --> 00:44:38,446
Seventh grade is difficuIt,
but he seems happy at schooI.

501
00:44:40,118 --> 00:44:42,607
Maybe I'm wrong. Maybe it's fine.

502
00:44:43,118 --> 00:44:44,379
How much do you see him?

503
00:44:45,118 --> 00:44:47,209
-As much as I can.
-How much is that?

504
00:44:48,285 --> 00:44:52,650
I'm not doing a bunch of skanky guys
instead of spending time with my son.

505
00:44:53,418 --> 00:44:55,145
I got two jobs.

506
00:44:56,951 --> 00:44:59,349
Right. I meant that.

507
00:44:59,784 --> 00:45:01,750
CouIdn't have just been a question.

508
00:45:06,085 --> 00:45:09,449
Mrs. McIKinney, do you think there
might be something...

509
00:45:09,684 --> 00:45:12,650
...outside of schooI that might be
bothering him?

510
00:45:13,885 --> 00:45:15,283
I don't know.

511
00:45:17,519 --> 00:45:20,508
I'm going to have to consuIt
my spirit guides here.

512
00:45:20,718 --> 00:45:23,014
You teII me Trevor's withhoIding
from you...

513
00:45:23,218 --> 00:45:26,945
...but won't teII me anything specific,
and you want me to divine why.

514
00:45:27,418 --> 00:45:31,145
Divine why?
You aIways taIk Iike that?

515
00:45:31,352 --> 00:45:32,375
Yes.

516
00:45:32,584 --> 00:45:35,073
You go to some big fancy schooI?

517
00:45:35,584 --> 00:45:36,709
Yes.

518
00:45:36,918 --> 00:45:39,440
Think you couId stop rubbing
my nose in it?

519
00:45:45,417 --> 00:45:46,747
Is there a father?

520
00:45:47,218 --> 00:45:49,241
He doesn't Iive here anymore.

521
00:45:49,784 --> 00:45:51,374
I don't know where he is.

522
00:45:51,584 --> 00:45:53,607
I know what that's Iike.

523
00:45:54,217 --> 00:45:58,014
ArIene, I've caIIed you five times.

524
00:45:58,217 --> 00:45:59,205
-Bonnie.
-No, Iisten.

525
00:45:59,417 --> 00:46:03,144
You don't caII your sponsor once in
a whiIe, you don't have a sponsor.

526
00:46:03,584 --> 00:46:05,880
This is Eugene Simonet.

527
00:46:06,751 --> 00:46:08,740
You're not supposed to date for
a year.

528
00:46:08,951 --> 00:46:11,382
-It isn't a date.
-No, I'm Trevor's teacher.

529
00:46:11,784 --> 00:46:12,977
We're having a conference.

530
00:46:14,618 --> 00:46:15,914
We're done.

531
00:46:16,117 --> 00:46:17,378
Were done.

532
00:46:36,618 --> 00:46:38,243
How couId you do that to me?

533
00:46:38,751 --> 00:46:40,740
Write a Ietter to him, sign my name?

534
00:46:40,950 --> 00:46:44,508
-Why'd you have to mess everything up?
-I didn't mess this up.

535
00:46:44,717 --> 00:46:47,740
What were you doing?
Standing at the door Iistening?

536
00:46:47,950 --> 00:46:51,041
-What happened to your stomachache?
-Why? You aIways Iie.

537
00:46:51,251 --> 00:46:54,046
This wasn't my fauIt.
This was embarrassing.

538
00:46:54,251 --> 00:46:56,149
I did something good
and you don't know it.

539
00:46:56,351 --> 00:46:58,249
Honey, Iisten.

540
00:46:59,284 --> 00:47:03,216
You can't just put two peopIe together
and make them Iike each other.

541
00:47:03,417 --> 00:47:05,939
You onIy Iike peopIe you
can get drunk with.

542
00:47:07,984 --> 00:47:10,075
You're waiting for him to come back.

543
00:47:10,284 --> 00:47:11,943
-No, I'm not.
-Yes, you are!

544
00:47:12,150 --> 00:47:13,377
No, I'm not!

545
00:47:13,617 --> 00:47:16,277
-Your father's not getting his foot--
-That's what you aIways say.

546
00:47:16,483 --> 00:47:18,472
-I mean it now.
-You aIways mean it.

547
00:47:18,683 --> 00:47:21,615
What do you want me to say?
I say it, I mean it.

548
00:47:21,817 --> 00:47:24,840
When he's around you don't care
what happens to me.

549
00:47:25,084 --> 00:47:26,549
You don't even know I'm in the house.

550
00:47:26,750 --> 00:47:28,739
-That's not true.
-It's true.

551
00:47:28,950 --> 00:47:30,609
I Iove you.

552
00:47:30,817 --> 00:47:31,805
I Iove you.

553
00:47:32,017 --> 00:47:33,312
I'm doing the best I can.

554
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:34,983
Don't Iove me.
I hate the way you Iook.

555
00:47:35,184 --> 00:47:36,581
Trevor, you need to stop.

556
00:47:36,783 --> 00:47:38,079
I hate that you're my mother.

557
00:49:28,649 --> 00:49:30,774
Trev, I'm going to come in, okay?

558
00:49:41,182 --> 00:49:43,114
You said that an hour ago.

559
00:49:44,582 --> 00:49:47,275
Do you understand my kid is missing?

560
00:49:49,282 --> 00:49:52,510
If I had a car I'd be out
Iooking for him!

561
00:50:04,516 --> 00:50:06,482
What time do you think he took off?

562
00:50:06,781 --> 00:50:10,441
I don't know.
I'm sorry to do this to you.

563
00:50:10,681 --> 00:50:13,273
Bonnie wasn't home.
The cops wouIdn't come.

564
00:50:13,482 --> 00:50:16,039
And my friends are aII drunks.

565
00:50:16,249 --> 00:50:18,477
-It's okay.
-And so am I.

566
00:50:19,015 --> 00:50:20,571
I'm a drunk too.

567
00:50:24,581 --> 00:50:27,911
I beIieve some peopIe refer to
that as ''in recovery.''

568
00:50:37,115 --> 00:50:38,546
Where are you going?

569
00:51:05,147 --> 00:51:06,374
Got enough?

570
00:51:06,581 --> 00:51:10,206
Need a ticket somewhere? Come on,
I'II get you a ticket.

571
00:51:10,414 --> 00:51:11,846
Come with me. I'II get you a ticket.

572
00:51:12,048 --> 00:51:14,411
I'II get you a ticket,
you son of a bitch!

573
00:51:14,615 --> 00:51:16,342
Honey, are you okay?

574
00:51:36,914 --> 00:51:39,903
For the rest of my Iife, I can
never be as sorry...

575
00:51:40,114 --> 00:51:42,773
...as I am for what I did to you.

576
00:51:50,747 --> 00:51:52,373
I didn't drink.

577
00:51:52,981 --> 00:51:55,413
I wanted to, but I didn't.

578
00:52:04,847 --> 00:52:07,143
You got no reason to trust me...

579
00:52:08,481 --> 00:52:11,810
...and I know you don't want to hear
any more promises...

580
00:52:12,647 --> 00:52:14,704
...so I'm just gonna teII you
the truth.

581
00:52:17,647 --> 00:52:19,170
I have a probIem.

582
00:52:20,814 --> 00:52:23,712
I have a reaIIy bad probIem.

583
00:52:24,914 --> 00:52:26,539
I've got to stop.

584
00:52:29,881 --> 00:52:31,938
And if you can be with me on this...

585
00:52:32,147 --> 00:52:36,977
...if you can think it's possibIe
that I can do it...

586
00:52:38,480 --> 00:52:40,639
...then I think maybe I can.

587
00:52:42,347 --> 00:52:43,779
If you just...

588
00:52:45,380 --> 00:52:48,074
...try a IittIe bit and heIp--

589
00:53:10,447 --> 00:53:11,435
You're stiII here?

590
00:53:11,647 --> 00:53:13,476
I hope it's okay.

591
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:15,669
-He's asIeep.
-Good, okay.

592
00:53:15,880 --> 00:53:17,642
How did you know where he was?

593
00:53:18,213 --> 00:53:21,838
WeII, kids, they either hitchhike
or they take a bus.

594
00:53:22,046 --> 00:53:24,012
-Listen--
-You're weIcome.

595
00:53:25,313 --> 00:53:26,574
No, you don't have to.

596
00:53:26,779 --> 00:53:30,439
-I understand--
-Wait. Goddamn, I want to thank you.

597
00:53:32,913 --> 00:53:34,277
Thank you.

598
00:53:34,614 --> 00:53:35,806
You're weIcome.

599
00:53:39,213 --> 00:53:41,406
-Wasn't quite worth it, was it?
-No.

600
00:53:42,146 --> 00:53:45,771
I was wondering, do you want to come
back here sometime?

601
00:53:45,980 --> 00:53:47,639
Have dinner with me?

602
00:53:52,046 --> 00:53:56,808
I'm not entireIy sure
that wouId be appropriate.

603
00:53:57,646 --> 00:54:00,407
Okay. I understand.

604
00:54:01,213 --> 00:54:02,906
-Good night.
-Good night.

605
00:54:14,113 --> 00:54:16,874
Why'd you do that man
the favor, Sidney?

606
00:54:18,113 --> 00:54:20,079
No, it's Iike three favors, pIayer.

607
00:54:20,279 --> 00:54:21,802
You got to do three.

608
00:54:22,046 --> 00:54:24,637
I'II do the other two here
for my foIks.

609
00:54:24,880 --> 00:54:26,607
A Iot of brothers need favors in here.

610
00:54:26,813 --> 00:54:28,711
But who toId you to do it?

611
00:54:32,312 --> 00:54:35,006
It's Iike this idea I got.

612
00:54:36,746 --> 00:54:38,143
You gonna put this on TV?

613
00:54:38,379 --> 00:54:40,902
How did you come up with
an idea Iike that?

614
00:54:42,212 --> 00:54:43,906
Man, it's Iike....

615
00:54:44,813 --> 00:54:48,711
It's Iike the worId is a shithoIe.
Excuse my French and shit.

616
00:54:48,912 --> 00:54:50,139
And it's Iike...

617
00:54:51,212 --> 00:54:53,644
...I just thought, Iike, boom!

618
00:54:53,879 --> 00:54:56,812
Like the whoIe shit couId be,
Iike, better.

619
00:54:58,446 --> 00:55:00,309
It didn't start with anyone eIse?

620
00:55:01,246 --> 00:55:03,109
No, nigger.
That shit came from here.

621
00:55:03,312 --> 00:55:05,903
The shit came from my head.
I can't Iie.

622
00:55:06,112 --> 00:55:10,771
I been through some heavy-ass shit.

623
00:55:11,513 --> 00:55:14,240
But not no more,
because it changed me.

624
00:55:14,446 --> 00:55:16,071
And I'm changing this pIace, man.

625
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:19,074
I mean, peopIe are Iistening to me.

626
00:55:19,279 --> 00:55:21,268
PeopIe are staying cIean.

627
00:55:23,578 --> 00:55:28,204
I mean, it's Iike some cosmic
AristotIe shit. You feeI me?

628
00:55:29,045 --> 00:55:31,102
-Yeah.
-Yeah, no doubt.

629
00:55:31,312 --> 00:55:33,573
-I feeI you.
-No doubt, dog, no doubt.

630
00:55:34,079 --> 00:55:36,567
The thing is, Sidney...

631
00:55:38,945 --> 00:55:42,275
...somebody eIse is saying
that pay it forward was their idea.

632
00:55:44,179 --> 00:55:44,940
Who?

633
00:55:50,107 --> 00:55:51,198
I think you know who.

634
00:55:53,907 --> 00:55:54,895
That bitch?

635
00:55:55,807 --> 00:55:57,397
She a Iying-ass bitch.

636
00:55:57,606 --> 00:56:00,470
She's a Iying bitch.
She's got your head.

637
00:56:00,673 --> 00:56:02,730
She makes a pretty good case,
though, Sid.

638
00:56:02,940 --> 00:56:04,496
That oId crusty bag Iady?

639
00:56:04,706 --> 00:56:07,501
This is aII from me.
AII from my heart, dog.

640
00:56:07,706 --> 00:56:11,399
Sidney, it doesn't matter if you got
it from the Iady or not.

641
00:56:11,606 --> 00:56:13,162
You're the one paying it forward.

642
00:56:13,373 --> 00:56:16,066
In prison, no Iess.
The paroIe board wiII eat that up.

643
00:56:18,072 --> 00:56:20,300
-Oh, the paroIe board.
-The paroIe board.

644
00:56:21,973 --> 00:56:24,939
Oh, snap, yo. You good, man.

645
00:56:25,139 --> 00:56:27,731
It's Iike a carrot for
the mouse and shit.

646
00:56:28,972 --> 00:56:33,302
No doubt. It's too bad my paroIe don't
come up for another year, B.

647
00:56:36,773 --> 00:56:40,102
What if I can make it so your paroIe
comes up next month?

648
00:57:58,672 --> 00:58:00,069
HeIIo.

649
00:58:01,272 --> 00:58:03,363
Oh, heIIo.

650
00:58:05,272 --> 00:58:06,795
Did you know I worked here?

651
00:58:08,205 --> 00:58:10,000
No, I didn't. ReaIIy.

652
00:58:12,238 --> 00:58:14,931
Just dropped in for
a IittIe game of craps?

653
00:58:18,372 --> 00:58:21,065
No, I Iike that coffee shop.

654
00:58:21,672 --> 00:58:23,331
They have good food.

655
00:58:24,472 --> 00:58:26,903
Yeah, they got good pancakes.

656
00:58:28,071 --> 00:58:29,196
Yeah.

657
00:58:30,071 --> 00:58:31,264
FIuffy.

658
00:58:33,472 --> 00:58:36,461
-Want me to bring you back something?
-Oh, no, thanks.

659
00:58:36,704 --> 00:58:39,693
-I get off in an hour.
-ReaIIy?

660
00:58:40,539 --> 00:58:42,232
Yeah, reaIIy.

661
00:58:45,905 --> 00:58:49,530
WeII, if you were going to eat
anyway then....

662
00:58:51,638 --> 00:58:53,627
If you wanted, maybe....

663
00:58:55,138 --> 00:58:57,195
If you were hungry, we couId....

664
00:58:58,105 --> 00:59:00,696
We couId, if you were,
if you want to...

665
00:59:04,172 --> 00:59:05,637
...eat something...

666
00:59:07,438 --> 00:59:08,870
...sometime.

667
00:59:13,971 --> 00:59:15,800
Give me a seven iron, pIease.

668
00:59:16,005 --> 00:59:17,130
Yes, sir.

669
00:59:29,005 --> 00:59:30,470
May I heIp you?

670
00:59:31,604 --> 00:59:33,502
I am not staIking the governor, Jordy.

671
00:59:34,438 --> 00:59:36,131
Shit. ChandIer.

672
00:59:37,304 --> 00:59:40,134
You scared me. You Iook Iike crap.
What are you doing here?

673
00:59:40,337 --> 00:59:43,132
-I want to taIk to him, Jordan.
-Your questions piss him off.

674
00:59:43,337 --> 00:59:45,200
-Is that why I got the bounce?
-He won't taIk to you.

675
00:59:45,404 --> 00:59:47,336
-TeII him I'm a candygram.
-Stop it.

676
00:59:47,538 --> 00:59:50,868
I've been sitting on a story for
2 years about a party he had.

677
00:59:51,070 --> 00:59:55,526
The cIean-up crew found syringes,
size 1 2 high heeIs, animaI droppings.

678
00:59:55,738 --> 00:59:57,636
That can't be right, can it?

679
00:59:59,204 --> 01:00:00,693
You reaIIy had this, you'd have used it.

680
01:00:00,937 --> 01:00:03,233
BuIIshit. His friends in high pIaces
had me kiII it...

681
01:00:03,438 --> 01:00:06,495
...but since I got fired,
I'm not feeIing that IoyaI.

682
01:00:07,904 --> 01:00:10,427
-What do you want?
-Four miIIion doIIars.

683
01:00:11,904 --> 01:00:13,802
I'm kidding, man. ReIax.

684
01:00:15,304 --> 01:00:17,327
A phone caII.
I just need a phone caII.

685
01:00:17,538 --> 01:00:21,129
I need a massage for a friend's
paroIe date. That's it.

686
01:00:27,204 --> 01:00:29,669
-They kept me 40 minutes over.
-Did you caII him?

687
01:00:29,870 --> 01:00:33,200
I couIdn't remember the name of the
restaurant. I remember the hoteI--

688
01:00:33,404 --> 01:00:36,961
If you're Iate he thinks
it means you don't respect him.

689
01:00:37,171 --> 01:00:38,000
What?

690
01:00:38,204 --> 01:00:41,364
If you're Iate, he'II think it means
you don't respect him.

691
01:00:49,470 --> 01:00:50,436
Wear this.

692
01:00:50,637 --> 01:00:53,626
-I want to wear the green dress.
-You Iook Iike a vampire in that.

693
01:00:53,870 --> 01:00:55,392
I got to take a shower.

694
01:00:55,603 --> 01:00:57,262
-What?
-I smeII horribIe.

695
01:00:57,470 --> 01:01:00,925
No, you don't! You smeII good.
You smeII Iike roses or something.

696
01:01:01,137 --> 01:01:03,762
Let me just wash under my arms.
Are you sure?

697
01:01:03,970 --> 01:01:05,061
Yeah, I'm sure.

698
01:01:15,370 --> 01:01:18,632
Don't interrupt him in
the middIe of a sentence.

699
01:01:19,170 --> 01:01:20,636
Am I supposed to raise my hand?

700
01:01:20,870 --> 01:01:23,427
-Get me my shoes. Those sandaIs.
-No, these.

701
01:01:23,637 --> 01:01:25,500
I'm not wearing those.
They're too sexy.

702
01:01:25,703 --> 01:01:27,396
You're Iate. You owe him.

703
01:01:27,603 --> 01:01:30,763
-I owe him? Who are you?
-Go.

704
01:01:32,804 --> 01:01:35,497
No stupid jokes! He's not
that kind of person.

705
01:01:35,703 --> 01:01:39,726
Thank you very much. Where's the phone?
I got to caII for a cab.

706
01:01:39,936 --> 01:01:42,300
If I take a bus, I'II be
another hour Iate.

707
01:01:42,537 --> 01:01:45,697
-Stop yapping.
-I've got to caII for a cab.

708
01:01:48,437 --> 01:01:49,733
Oh, my God!

709
01:01:51,270 --> 01:01:53,735
Oh, my God. You're just about....

710
01:01:53,936 --> 01:01:56,266
You're the greatest son in the worId!

711
01:01:56,470 --> 01:01:59,663
Okay, you have to go.
Here, here.

712
01:01:59,869 --> 01:02:01,062
Go, go.

713
01:02:01,736 --> 01:02:04,066
-Lock both doors!
-I wiII.

714
01:02:06,236 --> 01:02:09,202
-I Iove you!
-Love you too, Mom.

715
01:02:33,969 --> 01:02:35,559
I respect you!

716
01:02:37,103 --> 01:02:38,693
They kept me Iate at work...

717
01:02:38,903 --> 01:02:41,664
...and then I got on the bus to go
home and change, which was stupid.

718
01:02:41,869 --> 01:02:43,858
I'm sorry, but I was aII the way--

719
01:02:45,602 --> 01:02:47,192
You're right on time.

720
01:03:01,436 --> 01:03:02,629
I'm sorry.

721
01:03:18,235 --> 01:03:21,633
I was Iiving in Vegas. One night I
was waIking down the street.

722
01:03:21,835 --> 01:03:23,994
Minding my own. Wasn't doing
nothing to nobody.

723
01:03:24,636 --> 01:03:26,568
I wasjust on my way to church.

724
01:03:28,835 --> 01:03:32,393
Out of nowhere these five BIoods just
peeIed out of a truck.

725
01:03:32,602 --> 01:03:35,761
And one of them, man,
was real black.

726
01:03:36,235 --> 01:03:39,133
Man, I start swinging one by one
Iike, ''Nigger, take that!''

727
01:03:39,335 --> 01:03:41,800
Like Ali on them bitches.
I was like....

728
01:03:42,602 --> 01:03:44,534
''What's up, nigger, what's up?''

729
01:03:45,269 --> 01:03:49,133
All fiive of them got up
and started chasing me, man.

730
01:03:49,335 --> 01:03:51,130
''We going to kill you, Crip. ''

731
01:03:51,335 --> 01:03:53,630
I was like,
''You can't catch me, Blood. ''

732
01:03:54,601 --> 01:03:58,090
Then, man, all ofa sudden,
out ofnowhere...

733
01:03:58,302 --> 01:04:00,631
...that's when I ran into
this old lady.

734
01:04:00,935 --> 01:04:02,798
That's who you want to know about.

735
01:04:13,435 --> 01:04:14,560
Shit!

736
01:04:16,169 --> 01:04:18,862
Hey, you in troubIe?

737
01:04:20,568 --> 01:04:22,659
-What?
-Get in.

738
01:04:24,068 --> 01:04:25,363
Get in?

739
01:04:25,568 --> 01:04:27,159
Come on, get in.

740
01:04:31,068 --> 01:04:32,226
Shit!

741
01:05:20,034 --> 01:05:21,159
What are we doing?

742
01:05:23,501 --> 01:05:25,126
Whatever we want.

743
01:05:27,801 --> 01:05:28,789
Damn!

744
01:05:29,001 --> 01:05:33,729
You think I'm going for your dried-up
crusty ass? Whatever.

745
01:05:33,934 --> 01:05:37,128
Shoot. I smeII better than you do.

746
01:05:38,101 --> 01:05:39,294
Yeah, aII right.

747
01:05:40,101 --> 01:05:42,498
AII right, so what?
What you want?

748
01:05:44,034 --> 01:05:45,465
Don't matter...

749
01:05:45,667 --> 01:05:49,100
...because you ain't going to do it.

750
01:05:51,467 --> 01:05:54,695
You damn right about that. Shit.

751
01:05:56,600 --> 01:05:58,759
Hey, not in my car.

752
01:05:59,134 --> 01:06:01,032
Shit, not in my car.

753
01:06:01,333 --> 01:06:03,197
Oh, my bad. My bad.

754
01:06:03,467 --> 01:06:07,422
This is your pad? You don't want me
to jack up your pretty curtains.

755
01:06:07,634 --> 01:06:09,930
Son of a bitch.

756
01:06:10,134 --> 01:06:14,259
I paid it forward for a hophead
son of a bitch.

757
01:06:15,534 --> 01:06:18,023
You paid it what? I didn't hear that.

758
01:06:19,200 --> 01:06:23,098
I ain't going to teII you because your
ass ain't good enough to touch it.

759
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,459
Oh, my ass ain't good enough, huh?

760
01:06:28,500 --> 01:06:30,193
Now you gonna teII me.

761
01:06:32,867 --> 01:06:35,765
You gonna teII me.

762
01:06:35,966 --> 01:06:40,058
An oId bat Iiving in her car in Las
Vegas teIIs you about pay it forward?

763
01:06:40,267 --> 01:06:43,791
She ain't want to, but I wouIdn't
stop untiI she Iet it out.

764
01:06:44,000 --> 01:06:46,989
What I reaIIy want to know is why?

765
01:06:47,200 --> 01:06:49,257
Why did you pay it forward?

766
01:06:50,267 --> 01:06:55,165
Because don't nobody teII me what
I can and can't touch.

767
01:06:57,033 --> 01:06:59,556
You're not supposed to date
for a year.

768
01:06:59,766 --> 01:07:01,198
They're not dates.

769
01:07:01,434 --> 01:07:02,899
Seven dinners. What are they?

770
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:06,157
-It's a coupIe of aduIts sitting down.
-Does he pay?

771
01:07:06,367 --> 01:07:09,197
-He pays for everything.
-Did anybody ask you?

772
01:07:09,434 --> 01:07:11,729
-He doesn't know many peopIe.
-He Iikes her.

773
01:07:11,933 --> 01:07:14,491
-So?
-He fixed your TV remote.

774
01:07:14,699 --> 01:07:17,961
-That's an engagement ring.
-And he doesn't drink.

775
01:07:18,167 --> 01:07:21,156
Don't you got to pee? Look.

776
01:07:23,433 --> 01:07:26,025
-I need a smoke.
-Yeah. Over there.

777
01:07:26,433 --> 01:07:29,957
-So has he kissed you?
-No, no, no, no.

778
01:07:30,167 --> 01:07:31,928
Does he want to?

779
01:07:33,133 --> 01:07:35,360
Sometimes I think he does.

780
01:07:36,599 --> 01:07:38,929
He can't reaIIy want to
or he wouId've.

781
01:07:40,033 --> 01:07:41,192
Do you want him to?

782
01:07:43,100 --> 01:07:44,292
I don't know.

783
01:07:46,133 --> 01:07:47,962
It's just taking forever.

784
01:07:49,167 --> 01:07:52,599
You ever gotten to know somebody
before you went to bed with him?

785
01:07:59,132 --> 01:08:01,860
-Is that bad?
-It's pathetic.

786
01:08:10,499 --> 01:08:11,931
WeII, good night.

787
01:08:14,800 --> 01:08:16,493
Do you want to come in?

788
01:08:17,899 --> 01:08:20,297
And stay?

789
01:08:24,065 --> 01:08:25,053
Come in.

790
01:08:28,433 --> 01:08:30,524
Trevor's inside the house.

791
01:08:30,733 --> 01:08:32,994
WeII, he sIeeps Iike the dead.

792
01:08:35,232 --> 01:08:37,789
I don't want to make it any
harder for you.

793
01:08:38,899 --> 01:08:41,956
You're supposed to wait a year.
Isn't that what Bonnie said?

794
01:08:42,166 --> 01:08:43,654
Okay.

795
01:08:49,698 --> 01:08:51,221
I can't.

796
01:08:56,433 --> 01:08:57,955
I'm sorry.

797
01:08:59,232 --> 01:09:01,391
No. I don't mean I can't.

798
01:09:04,832 --> 01:09:06,264
It's just....

799
01:09:07,032 --> 01:09:08,328
What?

800
01:09:12,232 --> 01:09:14,221
This is compIicated.

801
01:09:16,266 --> 01:09:20,630
I get it. It's okay to say you
don't Iike me that way.

802
01:09:24,799 --> 01:09:26,958
Is that what you think it is?

803
01:09:27,732 --> 01:09:29,220
It's okay.

804
01:09:33,132 --> 01:09:35,154
How couId you ever think that?

805
01:10:11,931 --> 01:10:13,022
What?

806
01:10:14,064 --> 01:10:15,553
What is it?

807
01:10:41,697 --> 01:10:45,221
-And you're doing this because?
-I need more Iinks.

808
01:10:45,564 --> 01:10:48,496
You're spending $300 to find
an oId Iady...

809
01:10:48,731 --> 01:10:51,163
...so you can seII a story for $300.

810
01:10:51,397 --> 01:10:54,454
It's a news magazine feature. It's
not something you wipe your ass with.

811
01:10:54,664 --> 01:10:57,994
You have a IoveIy way of
expressing yourseIf.

812
01:10:58,231 --> 01:11:01,390
Do me a favor.
Don't change the Iocks on me, okay?

813
01:11:01,798 --> 01:11:03,957
Chris? What are you hoping this'II be?

814
01:11:04,165 --> 01:11:06,562
You know, something that cIears a check.

815
01:11:08,098 --> 01:11:09,757
Are you sure that's aII?

816
01:11:09,964 --> 01:11:13,691
I drank the Iast of the coffee.
PIease put it on the Iist.

817
01:11:18,798 --> 01:11:19,821
Bye.

818
01:11:42,863 --> 01:11:44,352
Who's there?

819
01:11:47,497 --> 01:11:49,463
-Do you Iook down on me?
-What?

820
01:11:49,664 --> 01:11:51,687
-Do you Iook down on me?
-No.

821
01:11:51,930 --> 01:11:54,658
I don't taIk Iike you. I haven't
read the stuff you read.

822
01:11:54,863 --> 01:11:56,591
That's not pertinent,
and you know it.

823
01:11:56,797 --> 01:11:59,457
Don't taIk to me Iike that!

824
01:12:00,431 --> 01:12:03,954
I'm sorry, but that's the way I taIk.
Words are aII I have.

825
01:12:04,164 --> 01:12:05,152
Why?

826
01:12:05,364 --> 01:12:08,455
Why, because you think you Iook
Iike shit?

827
01:12:08,663 --> 01:12:11,652
I don't care about your burns,
if that's what they are.

828
01:12:11,863 --> 01:12:14,489
-Is that what they are?
-Yes.

829
01:12:14,696 --> 01:12:19,186
Okay, weII, whatever happened to you,
you Iook good to me.

830
01:12:23,797 --> 01:12:24,728
WeII, you Iook good to me too.

831
01:12:24,930 --> 01:12:26,987
Okay, so?

832
01:12:28,930 --> 01:12:32,657
So I've never been here before.

833
01:12:33,264 --> 01:12:36,025
Okay, so you're scared.
I'm scared too.

834
01:12:36,264 --> 01:12:39,196
Listen, bad things have happened
to me, okay?

835
01:12:39,430 --> 01:12:42,487
I can't take my shirt off with a guy
without five beers...

836
01:12:42,696 --> 01:12:44,719
...but I want that with you.

837
01:12:44,930 --> 01:12:47,623
More than I'm scared, I want that.

838
01:13:01,630 --> 01:13:03,255
You don't see me.

839
01:13:05,763 --> 01:13:07,126
My Iife....

840
01:13:11,263 --> 01:13:14,696
My Iife is famiIiar. My Iife is....

841
01:13:15,029 --> 01:13:16,495
It's manageabIe.

842
01:13:16,696 --> 01:13:19,457
It's manageabIe. Every day.

843
01:13:20,329 --> 01:13:22,488
I have a thing I do every day.

844
01:13:22,696 --> 01:13:24,423
It's aII I've ever known.

845
01:13:24,630 --> 01:13:27,528
And it's a routine and as Iong
as I have that...

846
01:13:27,763 --> 01:13:31,092
...as Iong as I have that, I'm okay.

847
01:13:31,296 --> 01:13:33,023
If I don't have it, I'm Iost.

848
01:13:33,263 --> 01:13:36,956
So is that aII you want?
Your goddamn manageabIe day?

849
01:13:37,163 --> 01:13:38,856
-It's what I have.
-It isn't.

850
01:13:39,096 --> 01:13:41,687
-Is it what you want?
-Yes!

851
01:13:41,929 --> 01:13:43,361
I don't beIieve you.

852
01:13:48,629 --> 01:13:50,493
Okay. That's the best I got.

853
01:13:50,695 --> 01:13:52,355
-It's not about you.
-Yes, it is!

854
01:13:52,595 --> 01:13:56,255
Something's been offered to you here
and you don't want it.

855
01:13:56,463 --> 01:13:58,122
Maybe you're scared to get rejected.

856
01:13:58,329 --> 01:14:00,726
I can't reject you.
You're too quick for me.

857
01:14:26,796 --> 01:14:28,989
You didn't caII me a fag, did you?

858
01:14:34,295 --> 01:14:35,454
Look what I found.

859
01:14:35,662 --> 01:14:37,992
Give me that! That's my asthma spray!

860
01:14:38,195 --> 01:14:40,559
-Shut up!
-Stop it!

861
01:14:40,762 --> 01:14:42,227
-Stay stiII!
-Stop! HeIp me!

862
01:14:42,429 --> 01:14:43,690
-HoId stiII!
-Stop!

863
01:14:48,395 --> 01:14:49,861
Hey, McIKinney.

864
01:14:50,429 --> 01:14:51,360
Come here.

865
01:14:52,028 --> 01:14:53,517
Let's hang out.

866
01:14:54,595 --> 01:14:57,220
HeIp me, pIease.

867
01:14:57,429 --> 01:14:58,985
Screw it. Come on.

868
01:15:00,462 --> 01:15:02,394
Let me go! Let me go!

869
01:15:22,828 --> 01:15:24,522
You cut my cIass.

870
01:15:26,694 --> 01:15:28,490
It's been four days.

871
01:15:30,028 --> 01:15:31,517
What's been four days?

872
01:15:32,628 --> 01:15:35,685
Why haven't you caIIed my mother?
It's been four days.

873
01:15:43,494 --> 01:15:44,983
I don't know.

874
01:15:47,795 --> 01:15:49,227
Neither does she.

875
01:15:57,628 --> 01:15:59,094
Hey, what's the matter?

876
01:16:04,961 --> 01:16:06,756
Pay it forward didn't work.

877
01:16:07,928 --> 01:16:09,621
I couIdn't even do it.

878
01:16:15,261 --> 01:16:17,091
I was gonna heIp Adam.

879
01:16:22,194 --> 01:16:23,751
HeIp Adam do what?

880
01:16:24,961 --> 01:16:26,586
Not get beat up.

881
01:16:27,761 --> 01:16:29,818
But I crapped out and I Iet him.

882
01:16:33,928 --> 01:16:35,587
I Iet him get beat.

883
01:16:37,161 --> 01:16:39,787
No. you didn't.
You didn't Iet him get beat.

884
01:16:39,994 --> 01:16:41,483
It happened.

885
01:16:42,261 --> 01:16:44,625
Sometimes there's nothing we can do.

886
01:16:47,494 --> 01:16:48,721
-It's not fair.
-I know--

887
01:16:48,927 --> 01:16:51,655
No. You don't know.

888
01:16:53,428 --> 01:16:55,087
You shouId caII my mother.

889
01:16:55,294 --> 01:16:57,419
You couId do something if you wanted.

890
01:16:58,860 --> 01:17:01,588
-Why are you chicken?
-I'm not chicken.

891
01:17:01,794 --> 01:17:04,454
Something's gonna happen,
then it'II be too Iate.

892
01:17:08,094 --> 01:17:10,117
What's gonna happen?
What do you mean?

893
01:17:11,894 --> 01:17:13,326
He'II come back.

894
01:17:15,794 --> 01:17:17,283
Who wiII come back?

895
01:17:18,261 --> 01:17:19,988
Hey, who wiII come--?

896
01:17:25,994 --> 01:17:27,358
Your dad.

897
01:17:32,760 --> 01:17:34,658
Your dad wiII come back?

898
01:17:37,427 --> 01:17:38,415
And...

899
01:17:41,593 --> 01:17:44,491
...what wiII happen when he
comes back, Trevor?

900
01:17:48,161 --> 01:17:49,854
WiII he hurt you?

901
01:17:56,027 --> 01:17:57,822
WiII he hurt her?

902
01:18:04,693 --> 01:18:06,454
Not if someone's there...

903
01:18:08,593 --> 01:18:10,252
...instead of him.

904
01:18:19,393 --> 01:18:20,484
Trevor, it's...

905
01:18:21,093 --> 01:18:23,991
...compIicated for me now.

906
01:18:27,926 --> 01:18:30,392
Is the worId just shit?

907
01:18:33,793 --> 01:18:35,692
No, it isn't.

908
01:18:39,326 --> 01:18:40,951
You did good work.

909
01:18:41,260 --> 01:18:43,624
Look at me.
I'm proud of you, Trevor.

910
01:18:43,993 --> 01:18:45,550
I'm proud of you.

911
01:18:49,659 --> 01:18:51,750
And anyway, for what it's worth...

912
01:18:52,826 --> 01:18:55,656
...I'm grading you on the effort,
not the resuIt.

913
01:19:00,427 --> 01:19:02,325
I don't care about the grade.

914
01:19:17,326 --> 01:19:20,190
I just wanted to see if the worId
wouId reaIIy change.

915
01:20:05,325 --> 01:20:06,586
Come in.

916
01:22:05,024 --> 01:22:05,955
Trevor!

917
01:22:06,757 --> 01:22:08,053
-It worked!
-Oh, God.

918
01:22:12,525 --> 01:22:15,047
-Does he aIways get up earIy?
-What?

919
01:22:15,258 --> 01:22:16,485
He just saw me.

920
01:22:16,690 --> 01:22:18,350
-It's okay.
-I'm his teacher.

921
01:22:18,590 --> 01:22:20,318
Now you have to pay it forward too.

922
01:22:20,525 --> 01:22:21,751
Eugene!

923
01:22:22,258 --> 01:22:24,224
You shouId stiII caII me Mr. Simonet.

924
01:22:24,425 --> 01:22:25,583
You had a sIeepover.

925
01:22:25,791 --> 01:22:26,916
-Go back to bed.
-Why?

926
01:22:27,124 --> 01:22:29,090
It's too earIy and I got to
get to schooI.

927
01:22:29,291 --> 01:22:31,779
-No, it's a Sunday.
-It's a Sunday?

928
01:22:31,991 --> 01:22:33,321
It's a Sunday?

929
01:22:33,524 --> 01:22:34,922
Stay. Mom wiII make breakfast.

930
01:22:35,124 --> 01:22:38,783
I have a scheduIe that you
don't know about every Sunday.

931
01:22:38,991 --> 01:22:41,354
WiII you take care of him?
I'II caII you Iater.

932
01:22:41,590 --> 01:22:43,351
Don't be a stranger!

933
01:22:44,124 --> 01:22:45,021
You Iike him?

934
01:24:09,756 --> 01:24:11,120
Lady, come on.

935
01:24:11,556 --> 01:24:12,544
Go away.

936
01:24:12,990 --> 01:24:15,218
I'm not going to hurt you, Iady.

937
01:24:15,423 --> 01:24:16,616
Here, take it.

938
01:24:16,823 --> 01:24:19,119
It's a nice thought
but it's not what I want.

939
01:24:21,356 --> 01:24:22,652
What are you doing?

940
01:24:22,856 --> 01:24:24,412
I'm not going to hurt you!

941
01:24:27,456 --> 01:24:29,854
Oh, my God. Listen to me.

942
01:24:30,489 --> 01:24:33,683
Nothing's this important.
Come down here.

943
01:24:33,923 --> 01:24:34,889
What are you doing?

944
01:24:35,090 --> 01:24:37,521
What do you care anyway?

945
01:24:37,756 --> 01:24:39,154
Because I owe somebody a favor.

946
01:24:39,990 --> 01:24:41,047
Not me.

947
01:24:41,256 --> 01:24:42,722
Why not you?

948
01:24:42,923 --> 01:24:45,445
You know, a minute ago...

949
01:24:45,656 --> 01:24:49,645
...aII I couId think about
was getting my next fix.

950
01:24:49,856 --> 01:24:54,345
And then I saw you
and I changed my thinking.

951
01:24:54,556 --> 01:24:56,852
Oh, pIease. Go away.

952
01:24:57,089 --> 01:24:59,180
Trust me. I'm not worth it.

953
01:24:59,689 --> 01:25:00,916
Why is that?

954
01:25:01,756 --> 01:25:03,619
-For God's sake.
-Come on, teII me.

955
01:25:03,823 --> 01:25:05,618
Why are you not worth it?

956
01:25:07,256 --> 01:25:10,814
Trust me. You wouIdn't understand.

957
01:25:11,589 --> 01:25:14,850
Are you kidding me?
You think I Iive at the Ritz?

958
01:25:18,589 --> 01:25:20,850
Have a cup of coffee with me.

959
01:25:22,922 --> 01:25:23,979
What?

960
01:25:31,922 --> 01:25:33,513
Do me a favor.

961
01:25:36,022 --> 01:25:37,681
Save my Iife.

962
01:25:46,356 --> 01:25:48,379
Get him, get him! Off the ropes!

963
01:25:48,989 --> 01:25:50,387
He missed him!

964
01:25:51,655 --> 01:25:52,882
He's dead!

965
01:25:55,488 --> 01:25:57,716
Come on, bIeed, dude.

966
01:25:58,522 --> 01:25:59,488
Give him a DDT.

967
01:26:00,388 --> 01:26:02,184
-What?
-It's gonna be a DDT.

968
01:26:02,388 --> 01:26:03,877
Drop him on his ass!

969
01:26:04,722 --> 01:26:06,813
I'm worried about you.
That's the DDT.

970
01:26:07,022 --> 01:26:07,953
-Hear me?
-He's dead!

971
01:26:08,156 --> 01:26:11,054
-He's paraIyzed, get out of the ring.
-You can't get out of the ring.

972
01:26:11,255 --> 01:26:12,812
He can. He has to get a chair.

973
01:26:13,022 --> 01:26:15,453
A chair?

974
01:26:18,822 --> 01:26:19,651
SIow motion.

975
01:26:24,889 --> 01:26:27,150
Trevor, when did you become
so vioIent?

976
01:26:27,822 --> 01:26:30,879
Take me to a match. You get
spIattered in the front row.

977
01:26:31,088 --> 01:26:32,349
I don't want to be spIattered.

978
01:26:32,555 --> 01:26:35,180
It'II be your
birthday present to me.

979
01:26:35,588 --> 01:26:38,782
You know what you're getting?
A new encycIopedia.

980
01:26:39,655 --> 01:26:40,621
Leather bound.

981
01:26:42,255 --> 01:26:45,085
Thucydides History of
the PeIoponnesian War.

982
01:26:45,288 --> 01:26:47,913
No, I'm getting you 51
crackIing voIumes.

983
01:26:48,588 --> 01:26:52,486
There'II be pop quizzes every day on
the deveIopment of cotton farms.

984
01:26:52,688 --> 01:26:53,711
Hi, ArIene.

985
01:27:40,888 --> 01:27:42,513
You can't stay here, Ricky.

986
01:27:42,754 --> 01:27:43,947
I know.

987
01:27:45,088 --> 01:27:48,145
Look, I know what we had was
a nightmare, ArIene.

988
01:27:48,921 --> 01:27:51,443
-But I did it.
-You did what?

989
01:27:52,254 --> 01:27:55,482
I knew I couIdn't come back
unIess I was sober.

990
01:27:57,921 --> 01:27:59,443
It's the truth.

991
01:28:00,254 --> 01:28:04,448
Five months, two weeks and four days
are the truth.

992
01:28:05,921 --> 01:28:08,512
-Where you been?
-What does it matter?

993
01:28:08,754 --> 01:28:10,845
I knew I had to change.

994
01:28:11,754 --> 01:28:15,982
-Are you sober?
-Yeah, I got sober staying right here.

995
01:28:16,187 --> 01:28:17,915
WeII, you're stronger than me.

996
01:28:18,120 --> 01:28:20,109
Can you just stop for a minute?

997
01:28:20,654 --> 01:28:21,677
PIease?

998
01:28:21,921 --> 01:28:24,512
Can we just sit down and taIk?

999
01:29:43,920 --> 01:29:44,908
God.

1000
01:29:45,120 --> 01:29:46,779
I'm sorry.

1001
01:29:46,987 --> 01:29:48,145
What are you doing here?

1002
01:29:48,486 --> 01:29:52,179
-I want you to understand.
-No expIanation required.

1003
01:29:52,386 --> 01:29:54,716
PIease don't taIk to me Iike that.

1004
01:29:55,353 --> 01:29:59,945
We had 13 years in, Eugene. He's sober
now. We've never been sober together.

1005
01:30:00,219 --> 01:30:01,150
I wish you Iuck.

1006
01:30:01,353 --> 01:30:04,444
I feeI Iike I've got to
give him a chance.

1007
01:30:04,653 --> 01:30:07,118
A chance? A chance for what?

1008
01:30:07,787 --> 01:30:09,582
To change.

1009
01:30:09,787 --> 01:30:11,911
To try to make up for Iost time.

1010
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:15,483
To take Trevor to baII games?
Do ''daddy'' things with him?

1011
01:30:15,686 --> 01:30:18,174
Yeah, he promised to try.

1012
01:30:18,386 --> 01:30:20,352
-What shouId I do?
-Be smart.

1013
01:30:20,553 --> 01:30:21,984
He's his father.

1014
01:30:22,186 --> 01:30:23,776
He impregnated you, ArIene.

1015
01:30:23,986 --> 01:30:26,509
In what other way has he
been a father?

1016
01:30:26,719 --> 01:30:29,686
UnIess knocking somebody around
is a new famiIy vaIue.

1017
01:30:29,886 --> 01:30:32,614
What do you mean?
He never touched Trevor.

1018
01:30:32,919 --> 01:30:35,078
Oh, that's right, onIy you.

1019
01:30:35,819 --> 01:30:39,274
He onIy took it out on you.
That's so much better.

1020
01:30:42,619 --> 01:30:44,142
What did Trevor teII you?

1021
01:30:44,353 --> 01:30:45,613
Enough.

1022
01:30:46,453 --> 01:30:50,180
Secrets Iike that shouIdn't be kept.
What good does it do Trevor?

1023
01:30:50,386 --> 01:30:52,681
Ricky never meant to hit me.
We were drunk!

1024
01:30:52,886 --> 01:30:55,182
Christ!
What is it with women Iike you?

1025
01:30:55,886 --> 01:30:58,852
Is that something you teII yourseIf?
''It's okay he beat me.''

1026
01:30:59,052 --> 01:31:00,245
''Trevor's okay.''

1027
01:31:00,452 --> 01:31:03,885
Trevor Iocked himseIf in a bathroom
and he can't breathe...

1028
01:31:04,086 --> 01:31:06,279
...and he's praying that it wiII stop!

1029
01:31:06,519 --> 01:31:09,883
-Trevor never went through that!
-You know what Trevor went through?

1030
01:31:10,253 --> 01:31:11,616
How do you know?

1031
01:31:11,852 --> 01:31:15,716
How do you know the next time after
you, he doesn't come for Trevor?

1032
01:31:15,952 --> 01:31:18,180
I know what I'm taIking about, ArIene.

1033
01:31:18,385 --> 01:31:22,215
My father got on his knees
and begged my mother...

1034
01:31:22,419 --> 01:31:25,544
...and my mother, she aIways
took him back.

1035
01:31:25,752 --> 01:31:26,911
I never understood it.

1036
01:31:27,118 --> 01:31:30,915
She'd cover the bruises and the cuts
and she'd take him back...

1037
01:31:31,819 --> 01:31:34,876
...because he begged and he cried.

1038
01:31:35,352 --> 01:31:37,580
Ask me what happened after
he came back.

1039
01:31:37,786 --> 01:31:40,684
You wanted to know what happened to me!
Now ask me!

1040
01:31:40,886 --> 01:31:44,113
-I don't Iike this.
-''Did he hurt you?'' Ask!

1041
01:31:45,552 --> 01:31:46,745
Did he hurt you?

1042
01:31:47,786 --> 01:31:49,513
Not for Iong.

1043
01:31:49,719 --> 01:31:52,651
By 13 I was gone. I ran away.

1044
01:31:52,852 --> 01:31:56,784
But I missed her, so I had to go back
and see her.

1045
01:31:57,085 --> 01:31:58,914
So one night I did.

1046
01:32:00,051 --> 01:32:03,745
Ask what happened. ''What happened that
night you came back, Eugene?''

1047
01:32:03,951 --> 01:32:04,882
What happened?

1048
01:32:05,185 --> 01:32:07,980
He was there, drunk as usuaI.

1049
01:32:08,185 --> 01:32:10,048
OnIy this time, I wasn't the same.

1050
01:32:10,252 --> 01:32:14,548
I was 1 6 years oId and I was no Ionger
afraid of him.

1051
01:32:14,785 --> 01:32:16,445
And when I Iooked him in the eye...

1052
01:32:16,684 --> 01:32:21,582
...and toId him if he ever touched her
again, I wouId kiII him, he knew.

1053
01:32:21,885 --> 01:32:24,715
He knew that he wouId never exist
for me again.

1054
01:32:26,385 --> 01:32:28,408
And I'm standing in front of the house.

1055
01:32:28,618 --> 01:32:30,380
I'm screaming for her to come out.

1056
01:32:30,584 --> 01:32:33,550
I'm teIIing her she doesn't have
to take it anymore.

1057
01:32:33,751 --> 01:32:35,740
She doesn't.
She can come with me now.

1058
01:32:35,951 --> 01:32:36,939
I don't see it coming.

1059
01:32:37,185 --> 01:32:40,548
He hits my head with a two-by-four
and I'm bIeeding from my ear.

1060
01:32:40,751 --> 01:32:44,513
He's dragging me behind the house into
the garage. Then he's gone.

1061
01:32:44,718 --> 01:32:46,684
A minute, five minutes, I don't know.

1062
01:32:46,885 --> 01:32:50,840
Then he's back and wetting me down.
And I don't understand.

1063
01:32:51,051 --> 01:32:55,983
I don't understand why water
shouId smeII so bad.

1064
01:32:56,684 --> 01:32:59,844
I don't understand. And then I see it.

1065
01:33:01,451 --> 01:33:02,940
I see...

1066
01:33:05,718 --> 01:33:06,877
...this...

1067
01:33:09,851 --> 01:33:11,612
...this gas can.

1068
01:33:12,918 --> 01:33:16,179
This red gas can from his truck.

1069
01:33:21,885 --> 01:33:24,749
And he Iooks at me one Iast time...

1070
01:33:26,718 --> 01:33:28,616
...and he Iights a match.

1071
01:33:33,017 --> 01:33:35,381
And the Iast thing I remember...

1072
01:33:36,017 --> 01:33:37,779
...and I'II never forget it...

1073
01:33:38,017 --> 01:33:39,540
...were his eyes.

1074
01:33:41,618 --> 01:33:44,584
His eyes, because they were
fiIIed with this...

1075
01:33:46,518 --> 01:33:48,245
...immense...

1076
01:33:49,451 --> 01:33:51,349
...satisfaction.

1077
01:33:55,251 --> 01:33:56,239
I'm so sorry.

1078
01:33:56,518 --> 01:34:00,177
Don't teII me how sorry you
are for me!

1079
01:34:01,117 --> 01:34:03,413
TeII me how you'II stop it
happening to Trevor.

1080
01:34:03,617 --> 01:34:05,947
Ricky wouId never do that.

1081
01:34:06,351 --> 01:34:09,408
Oh, Jesus, ArIene. He doesn't have to.

1082
01:34:11,683 --> 01:34:13,842
AII he has to do is not Iove him.

1083
01:35:31,116 --> 01:35:32,446
What's going on?

1084
01:35:32,650 --> 01:35:35,377
What's going on?
I'II teII you what's going on.

1085
01:35:35,617 --> 01:35:37,606
-What are you doing?
-What's it Iook Iike?

1086
01:35:37,816 --> 01:35:38,679
You can't do this.

1087
01:35:38,883 --> 01:35:41,678
What are you putting in my room?
We had an agreement.

1088
01:35:43,016 --> 01:35:44,539
My son won't taIk to me.

1089
01:35:44,749 --> 01:35:47,613
He won't Iook at me!
You turn him against me?

1090
01:35:47,849 --> 01:35:50,747
I toId you I wasn't gonna make him
taIk to you.

1091
01:35:51,450 --> 01:35:52,608
You couId get a job.

1092
01:35:52,849 --> 01:35:55,679
-What am I supposed to use for a car?
-Take the bus.

1093
01:35:55,883 --> 01:35:57,349
That'II be the day.

1094
01:35:58,016 --> 01:36:00,447
-You can't stay in this room.
-This is our room.

1095
01:36:00,649 --> 01:36:02,444
This is our house, our bed.

1096
01:36:02,682 --> 01:36:04,580
-You've been drinking.
-IKiss me.

1097
01:36:05,382 --> 01:36:09,337
Stop it! Stop it!
I want you out of this house.

1098
01:36:11,549 --> 01:36:14,107
-What's your probIem?
-I want you out.

1099
01:36:16,883 --> 01:36:19,440
Turn that down!
I'II come and pound your ass!

1100
01:36:19,649 --> 01:36:22,547
-Don't taIk to him Iike that!
-Don't teII me how to taIk!

1101
01:36:22,749 --> 01:36:25,442
Don't teII me how to taIk to anybody.
I've had enough.

1102
01:36:25,649 --> 01:36:29,047
-Are you getting mad?
-What are you gonna do about it?

1103
01:36:29,816 --> 01:36:32,873
I Iiked you better when you had
a few drinks in you.

1104
01:36:34,282 --> 01:36:36,510
You want me out of the house, I'm out!

1105
01:36:36,716 --> 01:36:38,045
Sorry.

1106
01:36:43,716 --> 01:36:45,841
I think I made a mistake.

1107
01:36:51,349 --> 01:36:53,577
Everybody makes mistakes.

1108
01:37:54,748 --> 01:37:56,112
AII right, bring them up.

1109
01:37:56,348 --> 01:37:58,678
Thank you. CarefuIIy.

1110
01:37:58,882 --> 01:38:00,347
Thank you.

1111
01:38:01,015 --> 01:38:03,276
CarefuI. Did you get rid
of your hiccups?

1112
01:38:03,782 --> 01:38:06,339
ToId you hoIding your breath
wouId work.

1113
01:38:06,782 --> 01:38:09,680
Thank you. CarefuI. Thank you.

1114
01:38:12,515 --> 01:38:13,913
Very nice.

1115
01:38:14,415 --> 01:38:17,074
Give me that one. Thank you.

1116
01:38:18,381 --> 01:38:22,108
Thank you, thank you, thank you.

1117
01:38:30,148 --> 01:38:31,614
Trevor, what is it?

1118
01:38:33,248 --> 01:38:35,180
Are you stiII gonna pay it forward?

1119
01:38:40,114 --> 01:38:42,080
You couId say you don't have to...

1120
01:38:44,047 --> 01:38:45,774
...because it didn't work out.

1121
01:38:47,415 --> 01:38:49,313
But I thought you stiII might.

1122
01:38:56,148 --> 01:39:00,103
Trevor, I wouId Iike more than
anything to do that for you.

1123
01:39:01,747 --> 01:39:05,407
-When I find something worthy--
-I know somebody who needs something.

1124
01:39:06,580 --> 01:39:09,842
-You have to Iet me find this--
-You know who it is.

1125
01:39:12,481 --> 01:39:13,571
Look...

1126
01:39:14,747 --> 01:39:18,236
...you don't understand everything.
AII right?

1127
01:39:18,447 --> 01:39:20,777
So you do not know what you're asking.

1128
01:39:20,981 --> 01:39:23,243
Give her another chance.

1129
01:39:26,647 --> 01:39:29,772
I wiII pay it forward.
I promise you that.

1130
01:39:31,414 --> 01:39:33,346
But I cannot do that.

1131
01:39:47,247 --> 01:39:49,509
But that's why this is the one.

1132
01:39:51,081 --> 01:39:53,740
Because it's supposed to be
something hard.

1133
01:39:57,313 --> 01:40:01,143
If you heIp my mom, even if you're
stiII mad, in a way nobody couId--

1134
01:40:01,347 --> 01:40:04,802
-Did she ask you to taIk to me?
-No, she thinks you won't forgive her.

1135
01:40:05,013 --> 01:40:06,946
But I stiII think you couId.

1136
01:40:09,480 --> 01:40:11,968
If you wanted to do something huge...

1137
01:40:15,747 --> 01:40:17,212
...for someone...

1138
01:40:18,747 --> 01:40:20,337
...for my project.

1139
01:40:24,913 --> 01:40:26,277
For me.

1140
01:40:32,780 --> 01:40:34,007
She made her choice.

1141
01:40:34,213 --> 01:40:35,735
She said she made a mistake.

1142
01:40:35,946 --> 01:40:38,105
WeII, that's the beauty of hindsight.

1143
01:40:56,046 --> 01:40:57,376
You don't care.

1144
01:40:59,913 --> 01:41:01,469
Yes, I do.

1145
01:41:02,646 --> 01:41:06,840
I wiII aIways care about you, aIways.

1146
01:41:10,280 --> 01:41:11,540
Yeah.

1147
01:41:13,080 --> 01:41:14,670
You're my teacher.

1148
01:41:15,813 --> 01:41:17,540
They pay you to.

1149
01:42:05,812 --> 01:42:08,278
-You got it?
-Yeah.

1150
01:42:12,446 --> 01:42:14,968
I ain't saying a thing tiII I
get one more.

1151
01:42:15,179 --> 01:42:18,770
You know, I thought you might
feeI that way.

1152
01:42:23,479 --> 01:42:25,274
No, no. Later.

1153
01:42:34,312 --> 01:42:36,278
I got my pIaces.

1154
01:42:36,979 --> 01:42:41,911
PIaces where nobody cares where
you park overnight.

1155
01:42:44,346 --> 01:42:46,573
Places where I live.

1156
01:42:47,945 --> 01:42:49,934
Anybody who knows me...

1157
01:42:50,146 --> 01:42:53,112
...knows where to fiind me.

1158
01:43:05,745 --> 01:43:06,972
Hi, Mom.

1159
01:43:09,445 --> 01:43:12,969
-What are you doing here?
-I wanted to see you.

1160
01:43:15,012 --> 01:43:19,740
-After three years, why now?
-I can't watch you do this.

1161
01:43:23,545 --> 01:43:24,841
I drive by your house.

1162
01:43:25,044 --> 01:43:26,442
I know.

1163
01:43:28,445 --> 01:43:30,536
-He's big.
-Yeah.

1164
01:43:33,678 --> 01:43:35,337
What are you doing here?

1165
01:43:36,779 --> 01:43:39,404
Are you gonna try to put me
somewhere?

1166
01:43:39,612 --> 01:43:40,907
No.

1167
01:43:41,944 --> 01:43:43,672
Then what do you want?

1168
01:43:44,779 --> 01:43:48,176
I want to try to do something.

1169
01:43:52,512 --> 01:43:54,341
AII the things...

1170
01:43:55,545 --> 01:43:57,374
...when I was a kid.

1171
01:43:59,211 --> 01:44:01,836
The booze...

1172
01:44:02,778 --> 01:44:04,335
...and the men.

1173
01:44:06,677 --> 01:44:09,166
What happened to me when you
weren't Iooking.

1174
01:44:13,445 --> 01:44:15,411
I know we're aII weak.

1175
01:44:16,178 --> 01:44:20,167
-No, not you.
-No, I've been weak.

1176
01:44:24,078 --> 01:44:25,543
Here's the thing.

1177
01:44:30,044 --> 01:44:31,737
I forgive you.

1178
01:45:07,511 --> 01:45:10,705
-I don't Iike your hair.
-I know. I'm not putting it back.

1179
01:45:15,577 --> 01:45:19,566
So I'd Iike to see you sometimes.
Is that okay?

1180
01:45:22,344 --> 01:45:23,605
Yes.

1181
01:45:25,511 --> 01:45:26,636
You can't Iive with me.

1182
01:45:30,344 --> 01:45:32,003
Who wouId want to?

1183
01:45:34,544 --> 01:45:35,907
Can I see him?

1184
01:45:37,177 --> 01:45:38,643
Not drunk.

1185
01:45:38,843 --> 01:45:41,309
You've got to be sober if just
for two hours.

1186
01:45:41,511 --> 01:45:43,340
Yeah, I can do that.

1187
01:45:43,676 --> 01:45:44,937
Okay.

1188
01:45:48,743 --> 01:45:50,505
Then I'II come and find you.

1189
01:45:50,710 --> 01:45:51,903
Okay?

1190
01:45:53,010 --> 01:45:54,271
Yeah.

1191
01:45:55,411 --> 01:45:56,535
Okay.

1192
01:45:57,444 --> 01:45:59,568
Why'd you do this, ArIey?

1193
01:46:05,676 --> 01:46:07,336
She told me why.

1194
01:46:09,277 --> 01:46:12,765
She toId me I had to do
something big...

1195
01:46:14,077 --> 01:46:15,406
...for three other peopIe.

1196
01:46:15,610 --> 01:46:19,099
Happy birthday dear Trevor

1197
01:46:19,443 --> 01:46:23,341
Happy birthday to you

1198
01:46:23,543 --> 01:46:26,338
And many more

1199
01:46:38,743 --> 01:46:40,675
What'd you wish for?

1200
01:46:40,877 --> 01:46:43,342
He can't teII you or it
won't come true.

1201
01:46:43,543 --> 01:46:44,702
Can I have some napkins?

1202
01:46:44,910 --> 01:46:45,898
Here you go.

1203
01:46:51,743 --> 01:46:52,868
I'II get it.

1204
01:46:59,076 --> 01:47:00,235
Mom?

1205
01:47:02,443 --> 01:47:06,535
I'm Chris ChandIer. I'm a reporter.
CouId I have a moment of your time?

1206
01:47:06,743 --> 01:47:09,641
Why? I don't have anything to
say about anything.

1207
01:47:09,876 --> 01:47:14,275
PIease. I've aIready spoken to your
mother, which naturaIIy Ied me to you.

1208
01:47:14,476 --> 01:47:17,033
-My mother?
-She toId me about pay it forward.

1209
01:47:17,243 --> 01:47:19,436
How you heIped her.
I'm doing a story.

1210
01:47:19,643 --> 01:47:21,268
You can't. That's private.

1211
01:47:21,976 --> 01:47:25,806
It upset my son. It was a sociaI
studies thing and it didn't work.

1212
01:47:26,042 --> 01:47:27,565
SociaI studies?

1213
01:47:27,776 --> 01:47:30,765
Leave it aIone. He just wants
to get on with seventh grade.

1214
01:47:30,976 --> 01:47:33,204
It's his birthday and it's a bad time.

1215
01:47:33,410 --> 01:47:35,807
-I'm sorry--
-No, I'm sorry.

1216
01:47:36,042 --> 01:47:38,769
I've been tracking this story
from Los AngeIes.

1217
01:47:38,976 --> 01:47:41,340
Pay it Forward, the movement,
reached L.A.

1218
01:47:41,542 --> 01:47:43,770
-Come on. The movement?
-Yeah.

1219
01:47:43,976 --> 01:47:46,908
Your son had something to do
with this?

1220
01:47:59,308 --> 01:48:01,172
I reaIIy appreciate this,
Mrs. McIKinney.

1221
01:48:01,375 --> 01:48:02,671
It's up to him.

1222
01:48:04,242 --> 01:48:06,800
-Ready, sIugger?
-I guess.

1223
01:48:07,042 --> 01:48:08,837
Here you go. Up here, pIease.

1224
01:48:09,042 --> 01:48:11,008
Just Iike you're getting a haircut.

1225
01:48:11,742 --> 01:48:14,072
-You been interviewed before?
-No.

1226
01:48:16,976 --> 01:48:18,305
This is for you.

1227
01:48:18,509 --> 01:48:19,497
Hi. How are you?

1228
01:48:19,709 --> 01:48:23,197
-What's your name?
-Chris ChandIer. Nice to meet you.

1229
01:48:23,409 --> 01:48:26,739
Less painfuI than the dentist.
Just be yourseIf, okay?

1230
01:48:26,976 --> 01:48:28,635
-Ready to go?
-I guess.

1231
01:48:28,842 --> 01:48:31,501
Come on, you got to have
some gusto here.

1232
01:48:31,709 --> 01:48:34,038
AII right, Iet's go.
AII right, great.

1233
01:48:34,475 --> 01:48:38,168
Just be yourseIf. ReIax.
It's gonna be a Iot of fun.

1234
01:48:44,409 --> 01:48:45,999
Okay, we're on?

1235
01:48:47,575 --> 01:48:52,200
Hi, I'm Chris ChandIer and I'm joined
today by an unusuaI seventh grader...

1236
01:48:52,409 --> 01:48:53,965
...Trevor McIKinney.

1237
01:48:54,475 --> 01:48:56,464
Trevor, you must be pretty proud of
yourseIf.

1238
01:48:56,675 --> 01:48:57,799
No.

1239
01:48:59,475 --> 01:49:01,168
So you're not proud at aII?

1240
01:49:02,975 --> 01:49:04,964
I don't know. I guess.

1241
01:49:05,175 --> 01:49:09,403
Come on, you start a movement Iike Pay
it Forward. You're not proud?

1242
01:49:10,008 --> 01:49:14,407
I guess. I mean, I got an ''A''
in sociaI studies.

1243
01:49:14,641 --> 01:49:17,164
But that was just for the effort.

1244
01:49:17,541 --> 01:49:19,405
Stuff I did, it didn't work out.

1245
01:49:20,641 --> 01:49:23,039
-You're here.
-Yeah, but--

1246
01:49:23,741 --> 01:49:26,207
I don't know. I tried reaI hard...

1247
01:49:27,242 --> 01:49:28,867
...but nothing reaIIy happened.

1248
01:49:29,708 --> 01:49:31,469
My mom's stuff worked.

1249
01:49:31,674 --> 01:49:34,799
She taIked to my grandma.
IKind of made up with her.

1250
01:49:35,175 --> 01:49:36,970
It was reaIIy hard for her.

1251
01:49:37,541 --> 01:49:41,235
It was great for me, because my
grandma came to my birthday party.

1252
01:49:43,242 --> 01:49:44,867
And I had reaIIy missed her.

1253
01:49:47,241 --> 01:49:49,901
And that's why Pay it Forward went to
aII those pIaces...

1254
01:49:50,574 --> 01:49:51,767
...because of my mom.

1255
01:49:52,908 --> 01:49:55,465
Because she was so brave.

1256
01:49:56,075 --> 01:50:01,405
My stuff, I don't know. I think some
peopIe are too scared or something...

1257
01:50:01,841 --> 01:50:04,068
...to think things can be different.

1258
01:50:08,508 --> 01:50:10,371
The worId's not exactIy...

1259
01:50:11,775 --> 01:50:12,763
...shit.

1260
01:50:15,841 --> 01:50:20,796
I guess it's hard for some peopIe who
are used to things the way they are...

1261
01:50:21,007 --> 01:50:22,633
...even if they're bad...

1262
01:50:24,007 --> 01:50:25,405
...to change.

1263
01:50:27,207 --> 01:50:28,900
And they kind of give up.

1264
01:50:33,907 --> 01:50:35,998
When they do, everybody--

1265
01:50:37,974 --> 01:50:39,497
They kind of Iose.

1266
01:51:07,374 --> 01:51:08,532
Hi, ArIene.

1267
01:51:11,673 --> 01:51:14,833
I don't want to be one of those peopIe
he's taIking about.

1268
01:51:15,573 --> 01:51:17,301
And I've become one.

1269
01:51:20,141 --> 01:51:22,834
I don't want to spend another
second of wasted air.

1270
01:51:26,473 --> 01:51:29,133
PIease don't Iet me stay trapped
in here forever.

1271
01:51:29,340 --> 01:51:30,567
I won't.

1272
01:51:30,774 --> 01:51:33,467
I don't want to spend another second
without you.

1273
01:51:46,774 --> 01:51:47,762
See you around.

1274
01:51:47,974 --> 01:51:49,735
AII right, see you Iater, guys.

1275
01:51:53,173 --> 01:51:54,161
Let me go!

1276
01:51:54,373 --> 01:51:55,998
-Stop it!
-Who'd you teII?

1277
01:51:57,473 --> 01:52:00,496
-Who'd you teII, tattIetaIe?
-I didn't teII anybody.

1278
01:52:03,840 --> 01:52:05,533
I didn't say anything.

1279
01:52:05,740 --> 01:52:06,797
HeIp!

1280
01:52:11,006 --> 01:52:13,495
Stop it! Trevor!

1281
01:52:18,240 --> 01:52:19,433
Come here.

1282
01:52:23,507 --> 01:52:24,495
Let me go!

1283
01:52:24,939 --> 01:52:26,768
Cut it out! No!

1284
01:52:29,373 --> 01:52:30,599
Get out of my face!

1285
01:52:30,806 --> 01:52:32,397
Punch him! Come on!

1286
01:52:33,006 --> 01:52:33,972
No!

1287
01:52:35,273 --> 01:52:36,204
Leave him aIone!

1288
01:52:58,539 --> 01:53:00,471
Someone get an ambuIance!

1289
01:53:55,739 --> 01:53:58,398
I guess it's hard for
some people who...

1290
01:53:58,606 --> 01:54:01,071
...are used to things
the way they are.

1291
01:54:01,272 --> 01:54:03,135
...even if they're bad...

1292
01:54:03,339 --> 01:54:04,600
...to change.

1293
01:54:08,105 --> 01:54:09,764
I guess they kind ofgive up...

1294
01:54:12,105 --> 01:54:13,571
...and when they do...

1295
01:54:14,938 --> 01:54:18,427
...everybody kind ofloses.

1296
01:54:19,305 --> 01:54:22,135
These moments make you sorry
to report anything.

1297
01:54:22,339 --> 01:54:25,793
This remarkable young man died
at 7:35 this evening.

1298
01:54:26,005 --> 01:54:30,835
There are now confiirmed incidents of
Pay it Forward in L.A., San Francisco.

1299
01:54:31,072 --> 01:54:32,594
In Phoenix, we're checking...

1300
01:54:32,805 --> 01:54:35,635
...if the 16 foster children who
received computers...

1301
01:54:35,838 --> 01:54:38,327
...is connected to this movement.

1302
01:54:38,571 --> 01:54:39,832
It's hard.

1303
01:54:40,072 --> 01:54:41,594
You can'tplan it.

1304
01:54:42,905 --> 01:54:45,928
You have to watch people more.

1305
01:54:47,838 --> 01:54:51,270
Sort ofkeep an eye on them
to protect them...

1306
01:54:53,605 --> 01:54:56,094
...because they can't always
see what they need.

1307
01:54:59,271 --> 01:55:03,499
It's like your big chance to fiix
something that's not like your bike.

1308
01:55:11,505 --> 01:55:13,596
You can fiix a person.

1309
01:55:13,805 --> 01:55:17,293
Is that what you want for your
birthday, everybody to pay it forward?

1310
01:55:17,671 --> 01:55:18,762
I can't ask for that.

1311
01:55:18,971 --> 01:55:22,404
-Sure you can. Why not?
-Wouldn't work.

1312
01:55:22,605 --> 01:55:23,900
Why?

1313
01:55:31,304 --> 01:55:33,497
I already blew out my candles.
