1
00:00:48,000 --> 00:00:49,840
Number 14...

2
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:54,800
Eliza Naumann, Oakland Tribune,
Oakland, California.

3
00:00:55,880 --> 00:00:59,600
- "Oppidan."
- "Oppidan."

4
00:01:06,920 --> 00:01:09,000
My father told me once...

5
00:01:09,080 --> 00:01:13,200
that words and letters hold all
the secrets of the universe.

6
00:01:14,280 --> 00:01:16,440
That in their shapes and sounds...

7
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:20,240
I could find everything
and see beyond myself...

8
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,760
to something special...

9
00:01:22,880 --> 00:01:25,360
perfect.

10
00:01:25,480 --> 00:01:27,800
My father told me once...

11
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:30,840
that I could reach
the ear of God.

12
00:01:33,840 --> 00:01:35,880
Eliza?

13
00:01:35,960 --> 00:01:37,960
"Nozzle."

14
00:02:05,320 --> 00:02:08,080
From KQED public radio,
this is "The California Report."

15
00:02:08,200 --> 00:02:11,480
I'm Scott Shaffer. On today's show,
people from all over the country-

16
00:02:24,200 --> 00:02:28,040
... thousands of
supermarket clerks are on the picket line.

17
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:30,360
70,000 union workers at Vons-

18
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,760
...walked off thejob late Saturday
after contract negotiations fell through.

19
00:02:44,880 --> 00:02:46,680
At issue are-

20
00:03:56,200 --> 00:03:59,560
Ron says the Alfa's
gonna be ready this afternoon.

21
00:03:59,680 --> 00:04:02,760
- Great.
- So I'll pick it up and stop for groceries.

22
00:04:02,840 --> 00:04:04,680
- Okay.
- Hey.

23
00:04:04,760 --> 00:04:07,000
Hey, what are you doing?
That's my breakfast.

24
00:04:07,120 --> 00:04:09,920
- This is terrible stuff. How do you eat this?

25
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,240
- I'll see you later.
- Yeah, see you.

26
00:04:22,320 --> 00:04:24,240
- Bye. Thanks for the ride.
Okay, bye-bye.

27
00:04:24,320 --> 00:04:26,160
Bye.

28
00:04:30,120 --> 00:04:33,280
- Got your lunch?
- Mm-hmm.

29
00:04:33,360 --> 00:04:35,280
Bye, sweetheart.
I'll call after school.

30
00:04:35,400 --> 00:04:37,160
- Okay.
- Okay. Bye-bye.

31
00:04:37,240 --> 00:04:39,920
- Thanks, Mom.

32
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,520
Hey, wait up.

33
00:04:55,160 --> 00:04:58,320
Eliza, let's try "possibility."

34
00:04:58,440 --> 00:05:00,760
"Possibility."

35
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:04,680
P-O-S-S-I...

36
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:07,600
B-l-L...

37
00:05:07,720 --> 00:05:10,680
- l-T-Y. "Possibility."
- Correct.

38
00:05:11,960 --> 00:05:14,960
Courtney. "Graphite."

39
00:05:15,080 --> 00:05:17,840
- Correct.
O-R-O-W-

40
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,760
That's incorrect.
L-l-

41
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,880
Incorrect. I'm sorry.
You're excused.

42
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:23,800
C-L-T
"Placebo."

43
00:05:23,920 --> 00:05:26,920
- P-L-A-
"Random." "Indemnity."

44
00:05:27,000 --> 00:05:28,360
- L-N-
- "Flux."

45
00:05:28,440 --> 00:05:29,960
- "Flux."
- "Fluorescent."

46
00:05:30,040 --> 00:05:32,040
F-L-U-O-
Archaeology."

47
00:05:32,120 --> 00:05:34,520
A-R-C-H-A-E...

48
00:05:34,640 --> 00:05:38,120
- O-L-O-G-Y.

49
00:05:38,240 --> 00:05:42,480
Who's going to
be handling it? Who do we have this year?

50
00:05:42,600 --> 00:05:46,440
We've got Louis, Thomas-
We've got-So, that's James.

51
00:05:46,520 --> 00:05:51,080
Uh, "Aspects of Biblical Religion."
Ron usually takes that.

52
00:05:51,160 --> 00:05:55,840
Look again. Uh, 190.

53
00:05:55,920 --> 00:05:58,160
Topics in Religious Studies,
the Upanishads.

54
00:05:58,280 --> 00:06:00,080
I could do that or-

55
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:19,400
- Coffee? Thanks.
- On the stove.

56
00:06:19,480 --> 00:06:23,560
You know that dinner
of yours? We used every pot in the house.

57
00:06:23,640 --> 00:06:28,040
- That wasn't worth washing a pot or two?
- Or 10.

58
00:06:31,880 --> 00:06:35,080
- What's this?
- He's helping her with Hebrew school.

59
00:06:35,160 --> 00:06:38,600
Do you understand
a word you're saying?

60
00:06:38,680 --> 00:06:41,800
- I understand a lot of it.
- Yeah? Okay.

61
00:06:41,880 --> 00:06:46,280
- Translate, hotshot.
- Um, it's about where Abraham sacrifices-

62
00:06:46,400 --> 00:06:48,240
- No, not sacrifices.
...uh, starts-

63
00:06:48,360 --> 00:06:49,320
- Yes?
...to sacrifice Isaac to God?

64
00:06:49,360 --> 00:06:52,680
- Yes?
...to sacrifice Isaac to God?

65
00:06:52,760 --> 00:06:54,840
- You're being a bully.
- A bully?

66
00:06:54,960 --> 00:06:57,320
Maybe, but why shouldn't
he know what he's saying?

67
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:02,200
Isn't God in the words?
See, God is the words.

68
00:07:02,320 --> 00:07:04,680
The spoken words,
the utterances.

69
00:07:04,760 --> 00:07:07,320
How do we reach
the ear of God, Aaron?

70
00:07:07,440 --> 00:07:11,080
- Exactly. You speak with him. It's ridiculous.

71
00:07:11,160 --> 00:07:14,000
MostJews don't understand
what they're saying in services.

72
00:07:14,120 --> 00:07:17,200
Well, that's what attracted me.
The mystery of it all.

73
00:07:17,320 --> 00:07:20,040
- I thought it was Dad's cooking. [Laughs]
- Very clever.

74
00:07:20,120 --> 00:07:22,000
You missed a spot.

75
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:24,920
You're slipping. Come on. Let's go.
Let's play. Let's go.

76
00:07:25,040 --> 00:07:26,640
- Come on.
- We'll finish this later.

77
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,400
Hey, what do you think
about changing the tempo-

78
00:07:35,920 --> 00:07:38,680
I love this piece.
You been working on this?

79
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:08,200
- Good night, honey.

80
00:08:21,200 --> 00:08:24,520
- Hey.
- Could you drive me somewhere?

81
00:08:24,600 --> 00:08:27,240
So, uh, what is this again?

82
00:08:27,320 --> 00:08:29,640
I told you already.
The district spelling bee.

83
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,720
Don't you have to win
your school bee to be in that?

84
00:08:31,840 --> 00:08:34,760
- Uh-huh.
- God, Elly, that's great.

85
00:08:34,840 --> 00:08:37,400
Wow. I'm totally impressed.

86
00:08:37,520 --> 00:08:39,400
Dad must be in Dad heaven.

87
00:08:39,480 --> 00:08:43,280
- He doesn't care.
- How can you say that? He loves this stuff.

88
00:08:43,400 --> 00:08:46,800
I put the letter under his door.
He never said anything.

89
00:08:50,560 --> 00:08:52,400
I'm sorry.

90
00:08:52,480 --> 00:08:54,800
The spelling bee
is a truly American tradition.

91
00:08:54,920 --> 00:08:57,840
I'd like to welcome you to the
Oakland Tribune District Bee.

92
00:08:57,960 --> 00:09:00,520
Spellers, be proud.

93
00:09:00,600 --> 00:09:03,760
You are examples of the best
and brightest in our area.

94
00:09:05,880 --> 00:09:08,080
"Sequel."

95
00:09:08,200 --> 00:09:10,360
"Sequel."

96
00:09:10,480 --> 00:09:14,640
S-E-Q-U...

97
00:09:14,720 --> 00:09:17,320
- E-L.
- Correct.

98
00:09:20,080 --> 00:09:21,640
O-

99
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:24,560
"Turpitude."
"Fresco." "Homonym."

100
00:09:24,640 --> 00:09:26,520
Hom- Homonym.

101
00:09:28,040 --> 00:09:31,480
H-O...

102
00:09:31,600 --> 00:09:36,680
M-O-N-Y-M.

103
00:09:36,760 --> 00:09:38,640
Correct.

104
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,560
"Coyote."

105
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:43,080
- "Coyote." C-O-Y-
- "Affix."

106
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,840
- "Susurration."

107
00:09:44,920 --> 00:09:47,760
"Dendroid." "Extenuate."
"Notorious."

108
00:09:47,840 --> 00:09:49,680
'Anvil. " "Hydrofoil. "
"Graduate."

109
00:09:49,760 --> 00:09:51,120
- "Oasis."
- "Hoodlum."

110
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,840
- [Gavel Bangs]
- "Macramé."

111
00:09:54,520 --> 00:09:58,800
M-A-C...

112
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:01,680
R-A-M-

113
00:10:28,960 --> 00:10:31,200
...A- Y?
- Incorrect.

114
00:10:53,840 --> 00:10:58,600
S-A-L-I...

115
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,360
N-E. "Saline."

116
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:13,960
So, a paradox.

117
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:15,920
So, a paradox.

118
00:11:16,040 --> 00:11:19,320
God is... everything-

119
00:11:19,440 --> 00:11:22,840
a perfect, luminous essence.

120
00:11:22,960 --> 00:11:27,400
But even God wants more-
to experience more, to give.

121
00:11:27,480 --> 00:11:29,320
So God creates a vessel,
a container...

122
00:11:29,400 --> 00:11:34,240
that can receive this...
gift of God's pure light.

123
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:36,160
His divine light
pours into the vessel.

124
00:11:36,240 --> 00:11:38,160
- Come stand here.
- The vessel, of course...

125
00:11:38,240 --> 00:11:41,800
- can't contain the magnitude
of this light, and it shatters.

126
00:11:41,920 --> 00:11:45,320
Destroying the vessel,
and scattering its broken shards...

127
00:11:45,400 --> 00:11:48,080
in a big bang of creation.

128
00:11:49,760 --> 00:11:53,320
Now, man's job is to locate
and gather these shards...

129
00:11:53,440 --> 00:11:59,120
to make the vessel-
our world- whole again.

130
00:11:59,240 --> 00:12:03,160
Now the cabalists called
this fixing, this mending-

131
00:12:03,280 --> 00:12:05,600
they called it...

132
00:12:08,600 --> 00:12:10,600
Tikkun-

133
00:12:10,680 --> 00:12:14,600
- Tikkun olam, the fixing of the world.

134
00:12:14,680 --> 00:12:18,520
Now, any act of goodness,
altruism, kindness...

135
00:12:18,640 --> 00:12:22,520
that contributes to that idea
is considered tikkun olam.

136
00:12:22,640 --> 00:12:27,440
It's an extraordinary idea- that we
can restore what has been shattered.

137
00:12:27,560 --> 00:12:31,400
In fact, it's our responsibility
to try, each of us.

138
00:12:32,560 --> 00:12:35,160
Out of the very pieces
of the destruction...

139
00:12:35,280 --> 00:12:38,000
God has left us hope.

140
00:12:39,720 --> 00:12:43,520
- Polytheism papers due next Tuesday.

141
00:12:47,120 --> 00:12:49,840
[Mr. Naumann] Elly, this is fantastic.
Why didn't you tell me?

142
00:12:49,960 --> 00:12:52,280
- I did, but you didn't say anything.
- Hmm?

143
00:12:52,400 --> 00:12:54,200
She thinks you've
been ignoring it.

144
00:12:54,320 --> 00:12:57,800
- I put the letter under your door.
- What letter, honey?

145
00:12:57,920 --> 00:13:01,240
- From Dr. Morris.
- Dr. Morris?

146
00:13:01,360 --> 00:13:03,240
It's probably in the mess
on your floor, Dad.

147
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:09,640
- I'm really sorry. I didn't see that letter.
- She beat out a lot of kids.

148
00:13:09,720 --> 00:13:11,560
- Yeah?
- You'd have loved it.

149
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,480
Did you do that?

150
00:13:13,560 --> 00:13:17,560
Oh, man.

151
00:13:17,680 --> 00:13:20,880
I got another chance now, don't I? Because
you moved up to that next level, right?

152
00:13:20,960 --> 00:13:24,360
- The regional bee in Sacramento.
- Oh, perfect.

153
00:13:24,440 --> 00:13:29,680
Perfect. We'll all go. This is really,
really important, and this-

154
00:13:29,800 --> 00:13:33,680
This is a beautiful thing.

155
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:36,520
Let's take this home.
We'll show it to your mom, all right?

156
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:38,440
We'll put the top down
on the Alfa.

157
00:13:38,520 --> 00:13:40,400
Wow, what a great day!

158
00:13:40,520 --> 00:13:42,600
It's okay.

159
00:13:42,680 --> 00:13:44,760
Go with Dad.

160
00:13:44,880 --> 00:13:46,680
I'll, uh, see you at home.

161
00:13:48,640 --> 00:13:53,480
Okay, in the Chronicle, the Trib
and the Montclarion. Listen to this.

162
00:13:53,560 --> 00:13:55,760
- [Aaron] Wow.
- "Winner of the spelling bee...

163
00:13:55,880 --> 00:13:58,960
"that took place Saturday afternoon
at Albany High School...

164
00:13:59,080 --> 00:14:02,120
was sixth grader
Eliza Naumann."

165
00:14:02,200 --> 00:14:04,040
"Sixth Grader Bests
Middle Schoolers."

166
00:14:04,120 --> 00:14:05,880
Let me see.

167
00:14:06,000 --> 00:14:08,520
- That's great. I'm proud of you.
- "Naumann casts a spell."

168
00:14:08,640 --> 00:14:12,040
- You know, you've always been good at spelling.
- Yeah, but not this good.

169
00:14:12,160 --> 00:14:14,120
- It's not important.
Of course it's important.

170
00:14:14,240 --> 00:14:16,120
You know, there are people
who believe...

171
00:14:16,240 --> 00:14:20,000
that letters are expression
of a very special primal energy...

172
00:14:20,080 --> 00:14:22,600
and when they combine
to make words, they-

173
00:14:22,680 --> 00:14:25,000
they hold all the secrets
of the universe.

174
00:14:25,080 --> 00:14:27,080
- You remember the Vikings?

175
00:14:27,160 --> 00:14:31,440
Okay, the Vikings
called this epli.

176
00:14:31,520 --> 00:14:35,640
Now, when they took it across the sea
in their ships, it became apfel.

177
00:14:35,760 --> 00:14:37,680
Across another border,
it became appel.

178
00:14:37,800 --> 00:14:40,200
By the time it got to us,
it was "apple."

179
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,680
A-P-P-L-E. Its spelling
contains all of that.

180
00:14:44,760 --> 00:14:47,280
It holds its history inside it.

181
00:14:48,840 --> 00:14:51,560
Yeah, but that's not the secret
of the universe.

182
00:14:51,640 --> 00:14:53,360
- Isn't it?
- [Mrs. Naumann] Yes, thanks.

183
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:59,440
"Miss Naumann, youngest district
spelling champion ever."

184
00:14:59,520 --> 00:15:02,000
- You know that?
- Mm-mmm.

185
00:15:02,120 --> 00:15:04,080
Wow. Mimi?

186
00:15:04,200 --> 00:15:07,080
Mim, we're all going to Sacramento
next month.

187
00:15:09,160 --> 00:15:11,280
We came here for
the science fair. Remember?

188
00:15:11,400 --> 00:15:13,200
Yeah.

189
00:15:13,320 --> 00:15:18,040
Come on. Let's take a picture.
Excuse me. Could you hold this?

190
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:20,880
- Everybody.
- All right.

191
00:15:21,000 --> 00:15:23,360
- Smile.

192
00:15:23,440 --> 00:15:25,280
- There you go.
- Thanks. Thanks a lot.

193
00:15:35,480 --> 00:15:38,440
- "Lorgnette."
- "Lorgnette."

194
00:15:38,520 --> 00:15:41,200
L-O-R-G...

195
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:44,200
N-E-T...

196
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:46,440
- T-E?
Correct.

197
00:16:06,320 --> 00:16:09,560
- "Dandelion."
- "Dandelion."

198
00:16:19,280 --> 00:16:21,400
D...

199
00:16:22,960 --> 00:16:24,880
A...

200
00:16:25,880 --> 00:16:27,720
N...

201
00:16:28,720 --> 00:16:30,600
D...

202
00:16:36,120 --> 00:16:40,840
E-L-I...

203
00:16:40,920 --> 00:16:42,800
O...

204
00:16:45,080 --> 00:16:47,320
N.

205
00:16:47,440 --> 00:16:49,560
- "Dandelion."
Correct.

206
00:16:59,280 --> 00:17:01,200
"Daguerreotype."
"Daguerreotype."

207
00:17:01,280 --> 00:17:03,160
Incorrect.

208
00:17:05,840 --> 00:17:08,200
- "Chiliastic."
- "Chiliastic."

209
00:17:08,320 --> 00:17:09,640
"Inchoate."
- "Inchoate."

210
00:17:09,720 --> 00:17:11,720
Correct.

211
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:16,840
"Suture." "Iridium." "Nomic."

212
00:17:16,920 --> 00:17:18,760
"Staccato." "Pharmacopoeia."

213
00:17:18,840 --> 00:17:21,960
- "Glissando."
- "Glissando."

214
00:17:23,680 --> 00:17:25,800
G-L-l-

215
00:17:27,240 --> 00:17:29,320
"Glissando."

216
00:17:29,440 --> 00:17:31,120
S...

217
00:17:31,240 --> 00:17:35,440
A-N-D-O. "Glissando."

218
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:38,600
I'm afraid that's incorrect,
but don't leave the stage.

219
00:17:38,680 --> 00:17:42,000
If number 26 misspells her word,
the bee will continue.

220
00:17:42,120 --> 00:17:44,760
If she spells it correctly,
she'll be the winner.

221
00:17:46,960 --> 00:17:50,920
Number 26,your word is "batik."

222
00:17:51,000 --> 00:17:54,000
- "Batik"?
- "Batik."

223
00:18:02,600 --> 00:18:06,640
"Batik."

224
00:18:08,880 --> 00:18:10,520
Yes!

225
00:18:20,080 --> 00:18:24,600
That's my girl! I can't believe it.
Oh, that's great!

226
00:18:40,400 --> 00:18:42,320
I brought you a glass of water.

227
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,920
- Thanks.
- Here you go.

228
00:18:47,320 --> 00:18:49,800
Hmm. Is that my old suitcase?

229
00:18:49,920 --> 00:18:52,240
Dad gave it to me
for the state bee.

230
00:18:52,320 --> 00:18:56,120
I didn't know we still had it.

231
00:18:56,240 --> 00:18:58,760
My parents bought it for me
when I went to boarding school.

232
00:19:00,240 --> 00:19:02,320
Were you scared?

233
00:19:02,440 --> 00:19:04,520
At boarding school?

234
00:19:04,600 --> 00:19:07,440
Um- No. Uh-

235
00:19:07,560 --> 00:19:09,800
I was already about your age.

236
00:19:09,880 --> 00:19:13,320
There was nothing
to be scared of.

237
00:19:13,400 --> 00:19:17,040
- Why'd they send you?
- Hmm.

238
00:19:17,160 --> 00:19:19,200
That's what people did.

239
00:19:20,600 --> 00:19:22,600
Were you there...

240
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,720
when they died?

241
00:19:24,840 --> 00:19:28,280
Uh... yeah. Um, yeah.
I was at school.

242
00:19:28,400 --> 00:19:30,640
Mm-hmm.

243
00:19:30,720 --> 00:19:34,120
This is for you, Elly.

244
00:19:34,200 --> 00:19:36,040
It was mine.
My mother gave it to me.

245
00:19:46,720 --> 00:19:48,600
- What is it?

246
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,600
Oh, no, no, no. Oh, no.
Don't- Don't-

247
00:19:50,720 --> 00:19:53,040
It doesn't come apart.
It's a- It's a kaleidoscope.

248
00:19:53,120 --> 00:19:55,720
You look through it
and see things.

249
00:19:57,800 --> 00:19:59,600
Hold it towards the light.

250
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:01,480
- Hmm?
- Like that, yeah.

251
00:20:01,560 --> 00:20:03,400
- Oh.
- Turn it.

252
00:20:04,720 --> 00:20:07,120
I used to carry it with me.

253
00:20:08,680 --> 00:20:11,120
Mmm. I loved the way
it holds the light.

254
00:20:12,840 --> 00:20:14,640
Do you see that?

255
00:20:16,080 --> 00:20:18,440
Elly?

256
00:20:18,520 --> 00:20:20,920
Um-

257
00:20:22,400 --> 00:20:24,720
When you're trying
to spell a word...

258
00:20:27,040 --> 00:20:29,720
what happens... to you?

259
00:20:29,840 --> 00:20:32,280
I mean, when
you close your eyes?

260
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,760
I start out hearing it
in my head...

261
00:20:37,960 --> 00:20:41,560
in the voice
of whoever said it.

262
00:20:41,680 --> 00:20:46,440
Then the voice changes...
into something else.

263
00:20:46,520 --> 00:20:49,720
The word's voice.

264
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,880
And then I can see it.

265
00:20:52,000 --> 00:20:56,200
- What?
- The word.

266
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,280
I can see the word.

267
00:21:00,200 --> 00:21:03,560
- Mom?
- Go to sleep.

268
00:21:03,680 --> 00:21:05,720
Mmm.

269
00:21:05,840 --> 00:21:07,880
Good night, Mom.

270
00:21:16,640 --> 00:21:19,120
What you did today
at the bee...

271
00:21:20,120 --> 00:21:22,120
it was, uh...

272
00:21:22,200 --> 00:21:24,040
remarkable.

273
00:21:24,120 --> 00:21:27,080
Good night.

274
00:21:41,680 --> 00:21:44,400
Were you there...
when they died?

275
00:21:44,520 --> 00:21:46,440
Were you there... when they died?

276
00:21:46,520 --> 00:21:48,760
Were you scared?

277
00:22:12,200 --> 00:22:14,360
I'm tired. I'm tired.

278
00:22:28,240 --> 00:22:30,960
You know, Elly's never
had anything like this.

279
00:22:37,960 --> 00:22:40,200
[Mrs. Naumann's Voice]
I used to carry it with me.

280
00:22:46,960 --> 00:22:49,480
Mimi? Mimi?

281
00:22:49,560 --> 00:22:51,760
On y va maintenant,
ma douce.

282
00:23:03,240 --> 00:23:05,320
Hey, sweetheart.

283
00:23:07,000 --> 00:23:10,040
You look like you
could use a snack.

284
00:23:10,160 --> 00:23:13,200
I cut up some cheese or you can have
a cookie if you want, but...

285
00:23:13,320 --> 00:23:15,400
all that sugar,
you'll probably crash later on.

286
00:23:15,480 --> 00:23:18,920
- Protein's better.
- How come you're home?

287
00:23:23,440 --> 00:23:25,480
I came home
to be with you.

288
00:23:26,960 --> 00:23:28,880
Come on in. Come on.

289
00:23:29,000 --> 00:23:30,800
Come on in.

290
00:23:30,920 --> 00:23:34,640
You know, I thought this
could be our study area, right here.

291
00:23:34,760 --> 00:23:37,080
Now, we don't have
as much time as I'd like...

292
00:23:37,200 --> 00:23:41,240
but I think we can get through
a lot before the state bee...

293
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,240
and then, hopefully...

294
00:23:43,320 --> 00:23:45,880
we'll have another chance
for the nationals.

295
00:23:46,000 --> 00:23:47,880
What do you think?

296
00:23:47,960 --> 00:23:50,840
You know, it'd be like
you were one of my students.

297
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,280
I'm pretty good
at this kind of thing, you know.

298
00:23:55,400 --> 00:23:57,200
- That's Mom.

299
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,960
- Hi.
- Hi, honey. Are you okay?

300
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:05,480
Dad's here. We're in his room.

301
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:07,600
- Dad?
- He's gonna help me study.

302
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:10,360
- He wants to talk to you.

303
00:24:10,480 --> 00:24:12,760
- I'll see you later.
- Okay.

304
00:24:12,880 --> 00:24:14,680
- Bye.
- Bye.

305
00:24:14,800 --> 00:24:16,600
- Okay. Hey.
- Hi. What's going on?

306
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,120
- I rearranged some office hours
so you don't have to rush home.
- Oh.

307
00:24:20,240 --> 00:24:22,040
- Anything wrong?
- No, I'm-

308
00:24:22,160 --> 00:24:24,840
I'm-I'm fine. I'm just-

309
00:24:24,920 --> 00:24:26,760
- Uh, make sure-
- Mimi.

310
00:24:26,840 --> 00:24:29,840
- It's okay. We're having a good time.
- Okay.

311
00:24:29,960 --> 00:24:32,360
Okay. Bye.

312
00:24:51,120 --> 00:24:53,680
What happens
to you when you close your eyes?

313
00:24:53,800 --> 00:24:55,600
...when you close your eyes?

314
00:24:59,920 --> 00:25:02,160
Do you see what I see?

315
00:26:08,240 --> 00:26:10,600
What happens to you, Elly...

316
00:26:10,720 --> 00:26:12,560
when you close your eyes?

317
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:16,960
- Do you see what I see?
... what I see?

318
00:26:18,560 --> 00:26:20,240
In the world.

319
00:26:22,440 --> 00:26:25,360
- In the light.
... light-

320
00:26:25,480 --> 00:26:28,440
In everything around us.

321
00:26:32,680 --> 00:26:34,480
Here.

322
00:27:19,120 --> 00:27:21,480
- Hey!

323
00:27:23,920 --> 00:27:26,280
- You all right?
- I'm fine.

324
00:27:26,360 --> 00:27:28,240
Yeah? I expected you hours ago.
Where you been?

325
00:27:30,560 --> 00:27:33,400
I was starting to worry.
Called your cell. You didn't answer.

326
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,480
- Oh, I forgot to charge it.
- Oh, right.

327
00:27:36,560 --> 00:27:39,920
Uh, Phil asked me to coauthor
the Lancet paper.

328
00:27:40,040 --> 00:27:42,360
I guess he wants someone
to wash his petri dishes.

329
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:44,360
I thought you
only washed my dishes.

330
00:27:44,480 --> 00:27:46,920
- Hmm?

331
00:27:47,000 --> 00:27:49,320
- There's food here.
- Thanks. I got something.

332
00:27:49,400 --> 00:27:51,240
All right. Aaron?

333
00:27:51,320 --> 00:27:53,400
- Aaron!

334
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:55,320
Not so loud. Elly's studying.

335
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:13,840
I want you to write
the letters. All right.

336
00:28:13,960 --> 00:28:17,080
I'm gonna start you off here now,
but you gotta keep your eyes closed, okay?

337
00:28:17,200 --> 00:28:19,680
- Take a deep breath.

338
00:28:19,760 --> 00:28:22,760
- And just say the letters to yourself.

339
00:28:22,840 --> 00:28:24,960
The whole thing,
backwards and forwards.

340
00:28:25,040 --> 00:28:28,520
- Uh-huh. Relax.

341
00:28:28,640 --> 00:28:31,000
Just-Just concentrate
on the letters.

342
00:28:31,120 --> 00:28:35,280
- Good. Good, keep going.

343
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:40,360
V-W-X-Y-Z-Y-X-W-V-U...

344
00:28:40,480 --> 00:28:44,680

345
00:28:44,760 --> 00:28:48,960
- Open your mind to the letters, Elly. Concentrate.

346
00:28:49,040 --> 00:28:52,360
Put each one in your mind.
Let them flow through you...

347
00:28:52,440 --> 00:28:54,480
from your hand to the pad.

348
00:29:16,440 --> 00:29:18,800
Okay. You can stop.

349
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,240
That was wonderful,
really wonderful.

350
00:29:33,840 --> 00:29:35,720
I didn't do it.

351
00:29:37,360 --> 00:29:39,880
You know, it's not
what they look like...

352
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,880
it's what they feel like.

353
00:29:43,440 --> 00:29:45,360
You were perfect.

354
00:29:45,440 --> 00:29:47,960
Okay, I'd like us to try something else now,
a little bit different.

355
00:29:49,680 --> 00:29:54,440
Now, I want you to close
your eyes, take a deep breath.

356
00:29:56,960 --> 00:29:58,800
And now I want you
to open your mind...

357
00:29:58,880 --> 00:30:02,640
to all the words in the universe
that contain the letter E.

358
00:30:02,720 --> 00:30:05,400
E-

359
00:30:12,480 --> 00:30:15,400
E-

360
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:25,360
- Two, uh, chocolate Kwik shakes.
- Okay.

361
00:30:33,280 --> 00:30:35,320
Really good.

362
00:30:37,800 --> 00:30:41,520
Oh, great. Is this our champion?
- That's my girl.

363
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:43,440
- Elly, this is John.
- Hi.

364
00:30:46,360 --> 00:30:48,400
I brought
you here, Elly, because I want us...

365
00:30:48,520 --> 00:30:50,920
to start thinking about
something beyondjust spelling...

366
00:30:51,040 --> 00:30:53,640
beyond letters and words.

367
00:30:55,320 --> 00:30:57,160
You know that
to become a professor...

368
00:30:57,240 --> 00:31:00,680
I had to write a thesis,
kind of a book.

369
00:31:02,000 --> 00:31:04,240
I wrote about
something very special.

370
00:31:04,320 --> 00:31:06,120
About kabbalah-
Jewish mysticism.

371
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:10,000
And one of the most famous
of theJewish mystics...

372
00:31:10,120 --> 00:31:13,480
was a man called
Abraham Abulafia.

373
00:31:13,600 --> 00:31:15,720
What's a mystic?

374
00:31:16,880 --> 00:31:18,680
A mystic is a person...

375
00:31:18,800 --> 00:31:22,960
who believes that you can talk...

376
00:31:23,040 --> 00:31:24,960
really connect with God.

377
00:31:25,040 --> 00:31:27,120
Not just pray,
but have God listen...

378
00:31:27,240 --> 00:31:31,480
and sometimes, in special cases,
have God talk back.

379
00:31:31,600 --> 00:31:34,200
Aaron sings to God.
I've heard him.

380
00:31:34,320 --> 00:31:37,680
Yeah, well, we all can do things
in praise of God-

381
00:31:37,800 --> 00:31:40,840
write poetry, simply pray.

382
00:31:40,920 --> 00:31:43,520
But I'm talking about
something more...

383
00:31:44,800 --> 00:31:48,440
something that
almost no one can do...

384
00:31:48,560 --> 00:31:51,000
something beyond words.

385
00:31:51,120 --> 00:31:53,080
What?

386
00:31:54,160 --> 00:31:56,200
Let God flow through you.

387
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:02,760
Abulafia believed that
by concentrating on letters...

388
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,000
the mind could be opened up...

389
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:08,240
and reach what
he called shefa.

390
00:32:08,360 --> 00:32:10,440
What?

391
00:32:10,520 --> 00:32:13,480
The most special way
of being together with God.

392
00:32:16,360 --> 00:32:21,560
Steps to getting there
are in these books.

393
00:32:21,680 --> 00:32:23,640
Exercises, words and letters.

394
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,480
Like what we've been doing.
- Yes, exactly. Let me show you.

395
00:32:26,560 --> 00:32:28,760
Elly?

396
00:32:28,880 --> 00:32:30,920
Mmm?

397
00:32:31,040 --> 00:32:33,760
Elly?

398
00:32:33,840 --> 00:32:37,040
Elly. Bad dream?

399
00:32:39,520 --> 00:32:41,360
I have a present for you.

400
00:32:47,280 --> 00:32:50,000
It was mine
when I was your age.

401
00:32:50,120 --> 00:32:53,800
But we'll pick something up
before you leave tomorrow, if it doesn't fit.

402
00:32:55,680 --> 00:32:58,400
Get dressed for
school now, okay?

403
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:03,080
Thanks, Mom.

404
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,520
- Hey.
- Hey. Hey. What's up?

405
00:33:36,600 --> 00:33:38,440
- Uh, nothing.
- I'm late. Uh-

406
00:33:38,520 --> 00:33:40,840
- I was returning your Brodsky.
- Oh, God. I forgot about that.

407
00:33:40,920 --> 00:33:43,880
Yeah, could you put it on top
of my desk? I got to go. See you.

408
00:33:43,960 --> 00:33:46,880
- Okay. Bye.
- Bye.

409
00:34:26,400 --> 00:34:28,280
Have mercy on us all.

410
00:34:28,400 --> 00:34:31,280
Make us worthy to share
eternal life with Mary-

411
00:34:31,400 --> 00:34:33,200
- Oh, sorry.
Excuse me.

412
00:34:33,320 --> 00:34:35,520
...the apostles
and with all the saints...

413
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:38,120
who have done your will
throughout the ages.

414
00:34:38,200 --> 00:34:41,040
May we praise you
in union with them...

415
00:34:41,160 --> 00:34:45,320
and give you glory through
your son, Jesus Christ.

416
00:34:45,400 --> 00:34:50,040
This is the Lamb of God who takes away
the sins of the world.

417
00:34:50,160 --> 00:34:53,000
And happy are those who have
been called to his supper.

418
00:35:12,480 --> 00:35:14,440
The body of Christ.

419
00:35:26,600 --> 00:35:29,440
Dad? Is God red?

420
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:34,080
Red?

421
00:35:34,160 --> 00:35:36,000
No.

422
00:35:38,480 --> 00:35:41,360
The support about
which a lever pivots. "fulcrum."

423
00:35:41,480 --> 00:35:44,400
I've almost got it.

424
00:35:44,520 --> 00:35:47,640
F-U-L-C-R-U-M.

425
00:35:47,760 --> 00:35:50,920
Well done, Elly Belly.
Okay. "Puerile."

426
00:35:51,040 --> 00:35:53,720
Maybe that's enough
spelling for now.

427
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:57,680
Okay. Earth to Aaron.
Come in, Aaron.

428
00:35:57,800 --> 00:36:01,040
- What?
- So how about it? What do you think?

429
00:36:01,160 --> 00:36:02,960
- How about what?
- I asked you 10 minutes ago.

430
00:36:03,080 --> 00:36:07,320
You think you and Mom will survive
a few days while we're at the state finals?

431
00:36:07,440 --> 00:36:09,840
Yeah.

432
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:11,760
Sure. Whatever.

433
00:36:13,240 --> 00:36:15,400
Aaron? You didn't eat anything.

434
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:18,120
- Thought he liked my cooking.

435
00:36:25,120 --> 00:36:27,920
Okay, 713. This way.

436
00:36:28,040 --> 00:36:30,640
It's on this side.

437
00:36:30,760 --> 00:36:32,760
Here it is.

438
00:36:39,720 --> 00:36:43,040
- Wow, look at this.

439
00:36:43,120 --> 00:36:44,960
Adjoining rooms, pretty cool.

440
00:36:46,640 --> 00:36:48,520
Why don't you pick one, honey?

441
00:37:02,320 --> 00:37:05,360
- Which one do you want?
- This one, I think.

442
00:37:06,640 --> 00:37:08,680
Take the other one.
It's got a better view.

443
00:37:08,800 --> 00:37:10,760
You'll like it better.

444
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:13,680
You wanna practice a little?

445
00:37:13,800 --> 00:37:15,600
- Mm-hmm.
- Good.

446
00:37:22,400 --> 00:37:24,360
Tiger?

447
00:37:27,680 --> 00:37:30,360
- Tiger.
- Oh.

448
00:37:30,480 --> 00:37:32,360
Come here. Come on.
Sorry about her.

449
00:37:32,480 --> 00:37:34,360
- Don't worry about it.

450
00:37:37,040 --> 00:37:39,880
- So, are you?
- What?

451
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:41,840
A Hindu.

452
00:37:41,920 --> 00:37:45,680
- Oh, no. No.
- Too many gods?

453
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:48,440
Yeah, something like that.

454
00:37:48,560 --> 00:37:51,320
- I'm Chali.
- Aaron.

455
00:37:51,440 --> 00:37:53,240
- Nice to meet you.
- You, too.

456
00:37:53,360 --> 00:37:58,520
- School stuff?
- Uh, no. Just checking it out.

457
00:37:58,640 --> 00:38:01,000
Something's missing.

458
00:38:02,520 --> 00:38:07,120
- How do you mean?
- From your life.

459
00:38:07,240 --> 00:38:10,760
Yeah, I guess.

460
00:38:10,880 --> 00:38:12,720
I used to feel that way.

461
00:38:12,800 --> 00:38:15,600
I was raised a Catholic,
but it felt like empty ritual.

462
00:38:17,640 --> 00:38:20,000
Yeah, my mom was Catholic...

463
00:38:20,080 --> 00:38:22,240
and she, uh, converted
when she met my dad.

464
00:38:22,320 --> 00:38:24,560
We'reJewish.

465
00:38:26,080 --> 00:38:28,880
- Can I give you something to read?
- Yeah, sure.

466
00:38:40,400 --> 00:38:42,680
My number's on the back.

467
00:38:42,800 --> 00:38:45,800
- Oh, awesome.

468
00:38:45,880 --> 00:38:48,560
- It was nice to meet you, Aaron.
- Yeah, you too.

469
00:38:48,680 --> 00:38:50,480
Girl. Come on, you.

470
00:38:52,080 --> 00:38:55,240
- Bye, Cali.
Chali.

471
00:38:55,320 --> 00:38:57,160
Chali.

472
00:39:10,400 --> 00:39:13,800
That is correct. Except that you've omitted
the last and most important word.

473
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,480
9:30.

474
00:40:21,040 --> 00:40:23,360
Uh-Y-You're not
riding with me?

475
00:40:23,440 --> 00:40:25,320
No, I've got some stuff
to do after school.

476
00:40:25,400 --> 00:40:27,400
- You-You sure?
- Yeah.

477
00:40:54,440 --> 00:40:57,320
Hi, you've reached Saul Naumann.
Leave me a message and I'll get back to you.

478
00:41:01,280 --> 00:41:05,040
- "Selenic."
- "Selenic."

479
00:41:06,160 --> 00:41:07,960
S...

480
00:41:08,080 --> 00:41:10,000
E-L-

481
00:41:10,120 --> 00:41:13,680
- L-E-N...

482
00:41:13,800 --> 00:41:16,400
l-C.

483
00:41:16,520 --> 00:41:18,320
"Selenic."

484
00:41:18,440 --> 00:41:20,680
That's incorrect.

485
00:41:26,920 --> 00:41:28,880
"Cumulus."

486
00:41:29,000 --> 00:41:31,760
"Cumulus."

487
00:41:37,520 --> 00:41:39,240
Hurry up.

488
00:42:32,720 --> 00:42:35,640
Hi. Um, I'm here
to see Chali.

489
00:42:48,760 --> 00:42:50,800
Here, is it here?

490
00:42:53,840 --> 00:42:57,160
Is it the light here?
The air?

491
00:42:58,200 --> 00:43:02,040
The noise? The dirt?

492
00:43:02,160 --> 00:43:04,080
- Everything?

493
00:43:04,200 --> 00:43:08,920
Everything here? Everything.

494
00:43:09,040 --> 00:43:13,120
God has left us hope.
God has left us- God has left us hope.

495
00:43:42,320 --> 00:43:44,680
...E- E-N. "Duvetyn"?

496
00:43:44,800 --> 00:43:46,800
That's incorrect.

497
00:43:52,160 --> 00:43:54,600
"Cotyledon."

498
00:43:54,680 --> 00:43:57,360
"Cotyledon"?

499
00:43:57,480 --> 00:43:59,880
That is correct. "Cotyledon."

500
00:44:00,880 --> 00:44:02,960
May I have
a definition, please?

501
00:44:03,080 --> 00:44:07,080
A cotyledon is the primary
or embryonic leaf...

502
00:44:07,200 --> 00:44:09,040
or leaves of a seedling.

503
00:44:09,120 --> 00:44:11,600
What is the derivation,
please?

504
00:44:11,720 --> 00:44:15,000
"Cotyledon"comes to us
from the Greek.

505
00:44:26,200 --> 00:44:29,040
C-O...

506
00:44:31,120 --> 00:44:33,600
T...

507
00:44:35,280 --> 00:44:40,200
Y.
- Y-L-

508
00:44:40,280 --> 00:44:43,640
- E.
- E-D-

509
00:44:43,760 --> 00:44:45,560
- O.
- O-

510
00:44:45,680 --> 00:44:49,360
- N.
- N. "Cotyledon."

511
00:44:53,120 --> 00:44:55,160
Correct.

512
00:45:09,000 --> 00:45:11,160
Hey. You're late.

513
00:45:11,280 --> 00:45:15,000
- Mom knew.
- Well, she's late too.

514
00:45:15,120 --> 00:45:17,800
Guess what? Your little sister won.
She's going to the nationals.

515
00:45:17,880 --> 00:45:20,080
- Yeah?
- Washington, D.C.

516
00:45:20,200 --> 00:45:22,120
I'm cooking a victory dinner.

517
00:45:22,200 --> 00:45:24,920
Evening, champ. What'll it be?
Broccoli or beans?

518
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:27,400
- I know, I know, but you
gotta eat something green.

519
00:45:27,480 --> 00:45:30,920
- Do you want a- Congratulations.
- Thanks.

520
00:45:31,040 --> 00:45:33,640
- So what happened while we were gone?
- Nothing.

521
00:45:33,720 --> 00:45:35,640
Nothing? Something's gotta
happen in three days.

522
00:45:35,760 --> 00:45:37,560
- Not really.
- No?

523
00:45:37,680 --> 00:45:41,320
- You know, I left a sonata
on your bed before I left. Yeah, I found it.

524
00:45:41,400 --> 00:45:43,240
Want to give it a try
tomorrow, maybe?

525
00:45:43,320 --> 00:45:46,520
Um, I'm going out for pizza
and a movie tomorrow.

526
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:50,320
There wouldn't be a girl involved in
this pizza-movie venture, would there?

527
00:45:50,440 --> 00:45:53,960
- No, there wouldn't.
- You don't have to be embarrassed about a date.

528
00:45:54,080 --> 00:45:58,200
- It's not a date. So-
- Okay.

529
00:45:58,320 --> 00:46:01,160
Uh, I've got homework.

530
00:46:02,560 --> 00:46:04,400
- Dinner in an hour.
- Yeah.

531
00:46:04,480 --> 00:46:07,000
Fine.

532
00:46:12,840 --> 00:46:16,120
- Mim, is that you?
- Yeah, i-it's me.

533
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:24,720
- Mom?
- Yes?

534
00:47:24,840 --> 00:47:26,520
I think the blouse is lucky.

535
00:47:26,640 --> 00:47:29,640
- I'm gonna wear it at the nationals.
- Elly, you startled me.

536
00:47:29,720 --> 00:47:32,120
- I didn't know you were still up.
- I was watching TV.

537
00:47:32,240 --> 00:47:33,680
Let's put you to bed.

538
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,880
I love you, Mom.

539
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:47,400
Me too.

540
00:47:50,280 --> 00:47:52,080
G-Go to sleep now.

541
00:47:54,600 --> 00:47:56,400
I love you, Elly.

542
00:48:28,640 --> 00:48:31,280
We're not alone.

543
00:48:31,400 --> 00:48:34,960
Any of us, we can
make connections.

544
00:48:35,080 --> 00:48:39,560
- Tikkun olam.
- Yes, we can fix what's been broken.

545
00:48:41,720 --> 00:48:43,600
We can make things
whole again.

546
00:48:43,680 --> 00:48:46,480
Gathering shards.

547
00:48:46,560 --> 00:48:49,480
- Yes. Together.

548
00:49:02,360 --> 00:49:04,360
Hold me. Please, hold me.

549
00:49:05,960 --> 00:49:09,920
- Hey. Hey!

550
00:49:35,560 --> 00:49:38,440
H-Honey.

551
00:49:44,840 --> 00:49:48,200
Oh, honey.

552
00:49:48,320 --> 00:49:51,600
Oh, honey. Oh, God.

553
00:50:17,000 --> 00:50:18,600
How about this one?

554
00:50:18,680 --> 00:50:21,880
- Okay, thanks.
- Sure I can't tempt you, Aaron? It's really good.

555
00:50:22,000 --> 00:50:24,600
- That's my ride.

556
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:26,320
- We only need three.

557
00:50:26,440 --> 00:50:29,080
- That's perfect. Thanks.
- Okay.

558
00:50:29,200 --> 00:50:31,560
- I'd like to meet your friend.
- Maybe next time.

559
00:50:31,640 --> 00:50:33,480
There's a girl at the gate.

560
00:50:34,880 --> 00:50:36,800
Hi.

561
00:50:38,200 --> 00:50:40,240
- Hey, uh, hi. Hi.
Hey.

562
00:50:42,240 --> 00:50:44,040
Hi.
- Hello.

563
00:50:45,560 --> 00:50:48,440
Aaron, introduce
your guest here.

564
00:50:48,560 --> 00:50:50,000
- Hi, I'm Aaron's dad.
- This is Chali.

565
00:50:50,120 --> 00:50:52,360
- Chali.
- Chali?

566
00:50:52,440 --> 00:50:53,840
- Yeah, Chali.
- Chali. Okay.

567
00:50:53,960 --> 00:50:56,040
- I'm Miriam. Nice to meet you.
Hi. Nice to meet you.

568
00:50:56,160 --> 00:50:58,000
- You want some, uh,
chicken before you go?

569
00:50:58,080 --> 00:50:59,320
- Oh-
- I'm famous for the sauce.

570
00:50:59,440 --> 00:51:01,680
- She doesn't want any.
- No? Let her answer for herself.

571
00:51:01,800 --> 00:51:03,640
Actually, I don't eat chicken.

572
00:51:03,760 --> 00:51:06,760
- Why not?
- 'Cause I'm a vegetarian.

573
00:51:06,840 --> 00:51:08,920
Oh, interesting.
I was a vegetarian once.

574
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,600
- Okay, let's go. Come on.
- Okay. It was nice to meet you all.

575
00:51:11,720 --> 00:51:13,720
- Okay.
- Bye.

576
00:51:13,840 --> 00:51:17,000
- Nice meeting you.
Have fun. Come again.

577
00:51:17,120 --> 00:51:19,080
I grill a mean tofu.

578
00:51:19,200 --> 00:51:21,040
Bye. See you later.

579
00:51:34,760 --> 00:51:37,000
Okay, my translation.

580
00:51:37,080 --> 00:51:39,440
This notebook is my translation
of Abulafia's words.

581
00:51:39,560 --> 00:51:41,840
It's his guide, Elly,
for reaching shefa.

582
00:51:41,920 --> 00:51:44,200
"Cleanse your heart and soul.

583
00:51:44,280 --> 00:51:47,120
"Permute the letters
back and forth.

584
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:50,640
"This will arouse in you many words,
one after the other.

585
00:51:50,760 --> 00:51:54,120
"You will feel then as if
an additional spirit is within you.

586
00:51:54,240 --> 00:51:58,000
"You will experience
ecstasy and trembling.

587
00:51:58,120 --> 00:52:00,360
"In this manner,
you will reach beyond yourself.

588
00:52:01,640 --> 00:52:03,880
"Go slowly,
as the path is dangerous...

589
00:52:03,960 --> 00:52:05,840
and must be traveled
with caution."

590
00:52:05,960 --> 00:52:09,480
- I'd like us to try this.
- What?

591
00:52:09,560 --> 00:52:12,360
A permutation.

592
00:52:12,440 --> 00:52:14,440
Other people...

593
00:52:14,520 --> 00:52:18,680
have tried to do these,
but almost no one has felt...

594
00:52:18,800 --> 00:52:21,040
that special feeling
that he wrote about.

595
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,760
I haven't been able
to do it. I tried.

596
00:52:24,880 --> 00:52:28,120
It was very important
to me, but... I couldn't.

597
00:52:28,240 --> 00:52:30,920
But I think maybe you can.

598
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:33,640
I think you have
what Abulafia had.

599
00:52:33,760 --> 00:52:35,600
I saw it on the stage
at the bee.

600
00:52:35,680 --> 00:52:39,000
I think you can use
his methods to achieve shefa...

601
00:52:39,120 --> 00:52:41,160
to reach the ear of God.

602
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:45,840
Let me show you
what I mean.

603
00:52:45,960 --> 00:52:47,760
Let's permute
the word "Earth."

604
00:52:49,040 --> 00:52:51,920
What's inside
this word? "Earth."

605
00:52:52,040 --> 00:52:53,840
"Heart." "Rathe."

606
00:52:53,960 --> 00:52:55,880
- Like in Boggle.
- Yeah, like that.

607
00:52:55,960 --> 00:52:58,680
Except the combinations don't
have to mean anything in the usual sense.

608
00:53:00,040 --> 00:53:04,080
Try another one.
You do it. Uh, "library."

609
00:53:10,480 --> 00:53:12,280
Make yourself right.

610
00:53:12,400 --> 00:53:15,040
Cleanse your heart and soul.
Permute the letters back and forth.

611
00:53:15,120 --> 00:53:17,320
Permute the letters back and forth.

612
00:53:17,440 --> 00:53:19,280
- You will feel then-
- You will feel then-

613
00:53:19,360 --> 00:53:22,520
...as if an additional spirit-
...as if an additional spirit is within you.

614
00:53:22,640 --> 00:53:25,600
- In this manner you will-
- In this manner you will reach beyond yourself.

615
00:53:25,680 --> 00:53:28,920
Go slowly,
as the path is dangerous...

616
00:53:29,040 --> 00:53:32,800
and must be traveled
with caution.

617
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,920
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare...

618
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:37,000
Hare Rama,
Rama, Rama, Hare, Hare...

619
00:53:37,080 --> 00:53:39,680
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare...

620
00:53:39,760 --> 00:53:42,360
- Hare Rama, Rama Hare-

621
00:53:45,280 --> 00:53:47,800
Yeah?

622
00:53:49,120 --> 00:53:51,600
- It's me.
- Hey.

623
00:53:51,720 --> 00:53:55,800
- She was nice.
- Thanks.

624
00:54:02,880 --> 00:54:06,000
It smells nice in here.

625
00:55:58,760 --> 00:56:00,680
I'm sorry I'm late.

626
00:56:02,520 --> 00:56:04,520
Where were you?

627
00:56:08,720 --> 00:56:12,360
- Miriam?
- I'm just tired, and I want to go to sleep.

628
00:56:49,400 --> 00:56:51,280
Will there be supervision?

629
00:56:51,400 --> 00:56:54,720
Mm-hmm. I took
the blue sleeping bag.

630
00:56:54,840 --> 00:56:56,560
All right.

631
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:04,400
- Hi. Uh, Aaron's going camping.
- Just for the weekend.

632
00:57:04,520 --> 00:57:06,360
Mom said it was okay.

633
00:57:06,480 --> 00:57:08,720
Alone?

634
00:57:08,840 --> 00:57:11,960
Uh, no.
With the Sierra Club.

635
00:57:12,080 --> 00:57:14,920
Bye.
- Bye. Thanks a lot.

636
00:57:15,040 --> 00:57:17,480
Bye.

637
00:57:17,600 --> 00:57:22,000
- I like camping.

638
00:57:30,200 --> 00:57:34,120
Hare, Hare, Hare Krishna

639
00:57:41,320 --> 00:57:45,520
Elly, I want you to take
one simple, easy breath...

640
00:57:45,600 --> 00:57:47,920
and draw the sound out
from very deep inside of you-

641
00:57:48,000 --> 00:57:51,400
- "Krishna, Krishna"
- till you can taste it completely.

642
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,880
And when you're ready,
just let your body move.

643
00:58:14,000 --> 00:58:16,360
"Hare Krishna
Hare Krishna"

644
00:59:05,840 --> 00:59:07,880
What's wrong?

645
00:59:09,760 --> 00:59:11,600
Why do you
look like that?

646
00:59:11,720 --> 00:59:14,600
- Dad?

647
00:59:14,720 --> 00:59:16,560
You moved the way
Abulafia described it.

648
00:59:16,640 --> 00:59:18,480
I want to do more.

649
00:59:18,560 --> 00:59:22,520
Remember what I told you?

650
00:59:22,640 --> 00:59:24,440
We're gonna take
our time with this.

651
00:59:24,560 --> 00:59:27,120
- Okay.
- If we go too fast, this could be dangerous.

652
00:59:27,240 --> 00:59:32,200
What we're doing here
is a very special kind of knowledge.

653
00:59:32,280 --> 00:59:35,000
- The words in this notebook are very powerful.
- 'Kay.

654
00:59:37,680 --> 00:59:39,760
We'll see how it goes
after the nationals.

655
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:44,520
It- It feels so light.

656
00:59:46,440 --> 00:59:48,240
Yeah. Yeah, light.

657
00:59:52,280 --> 00:59:55,160
All right.
Just one more time.

658
01:00:09,120 --> 01:00:13,000
"Adonai"

659
01:00:13,120 --> 01:00:16,360
Hare Rama, Hare Rama,
Rama, Rama, Hare, Hare...

660
01:00:16,440 --> 01:00:19,240
Hare Krishna, Hare Krishna,
Krishna, Krishna, Hare, Hare-

661
01:01:14,080 --> 01:01:16,680
- Hello.
- Hello.

662
01:01:24,400 --> 01:01:26,200
I'm really happy here, Chali.

663
01:01:48,320 --> 01:01:51,360
Oh. Oh.
- It's okay.

664
01:01:51,440 --> 01:01:54,480
Oh, dear.
Why didn't you wake me?

665
01:01:54,600 --> 01:01:57,280
- I just found you here.

666
01:01:58,720 --> 01:02:00,600
You're bleeding.

667
01:02:00,720 --> 01:02:02,520
- What is this?
- Uh-

668
01:02:02,640 --> 01:02:05,480
Oh, I must have bumped-
bumped my head on the table.

669
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,440
- How'd you do that?
- I don't know.

670
01:02:18,400 --> 01:02:21,240
Hey, what's going on, Mim?

671
01:02:21,360 --> 01:02:23,720
- Nothing.
- Nothing?

672
01:02:24,920 --> 01:02:26,600
Is there something
you want to tell me?

673
01:02:28,240 --> 01:02:30,120
What?

674
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,160
Because I don't know what you're doing.
I don't know where you've been.

675
01:02:33,240 --> 01:02:35,280
I don't know where you went.
I don't know anything.

676
01:02:38,040 --> 01:02:40,000
I'm sorry.

677
01:02:48,320 --> 01:02:50,200
What's the matter with Mom?

678
01:02:50,320 --> 01:02:53,520
Oh, she just fell
asleep here, honey.

679
01:02:53,640 --> 01:02:55,600
In the kitchen?

680
01:02:57,120 --> 01:02:59,600
Yeah, she's okay.
She's- She's okay.

681
01:03:01,520 --> 01:03:03,320
Your brother's
coming home tonight.

682
01:03:03,440 --> 01:03:06,520
We're gonna-We're gonna have
a nice family dinner.

683
01:04:29,320 --> 01:04:32,040
- Hey.
- Hey. Back from the wilderness.

684
01:04:32,160 --> 01:04:34,800
- All in one piece.
- Yeah.

685
01:04:34,920 --> 01:04:38,280
See the article on Elly
today in the paper?

686
01:04:38,400 --> 01:04:41,360
- No.
- About her going to the national bee.

687
01:04:41,480 --> 01:04:45,200
So how 'bout you?
Sacrifice any virgins out there?

688
01:04:55,720 --> 01:04:57,520
Hey.

689
01:05:02,360 --> 01:05:06,800
She's been gone all day.
She didn't take the car.

690
01:05:08,320 --> 01:05:12,840
And in the morning...
her head was bleeding.

691
01:05:15,120 --> 01:05:17,880
You saw that?
Her head was bleeding?

692
01:05:21,920 --> 01:05:26,840
Elly... if-if I tell you something...

693
01:05:26,960 --> 01:05:28,800
will you promise
to keep it to yourself?

694
01:05:32,560 --> 01:05:34,400
I didn't go camping.

695
01:05:35,680 --> 01:05:37,560
Where'd you go?

696
01:05:39,320 --> 01:05:42,440
To a place for...

697
01:05:42,520 --> 01:05:44,520
people who want
to get closer to God.

698
01:05:47,440 --> 01:05:49,520
Dad wants to get
closer to God.

699
01:05:51,800 --> 01:05:53,640
Yeah, well.

700
01:05:55,440 --> 01:05:58,720
Do you like it better...
there?

701
01:06:12,680 --> 01:06:17,120
Hello?
Yes, this is Mr. Naumann.

702
01:06:17,200 --> 01:06:19,040
Yes, Saul Naumann.

703
01:06:20,560 --> 01:06:23,320
Look.

704
01:06:23,440 --> 01:06:25,960
Your mother's been-

705
01:06:26,080 --> 01:06:28,880
I'll call you as soon
as I know everything, okay?

706
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,640
Is it because of my spelling?

707
01:07:02,440 --> 01:07:04,240
It has nothing to do with you.

708
01:07:06,360 --> 01:07:08,240
Go to sleep.

709
01:07:20,200 --> 01:07:22,640
What is this?

710
01:07:22,760 --> 01:07:28,440
It's the address your wife gave as her
place of residence. She had the key in her pocket.

711
01:07:43,760 --> 01:07:46,120
Manager said she's had
the space for years.

712
01:07:49,080 --> 01:07:51,120
We're looking into how much
of this stuff is stolen.

713
01:09:16,720 --> 01:09:19,040
- Mind if I smoke?
- No.

714
01:09:57,880 --> 01:09:59,720
She's in the hospital.

715
01:10:01,280 --> 01:10:03,080
She was exhausted.

716
01:10:04,200 --> 01:10:06,440
Sick and confused.

717
01:10:06,520 --> 01:10:08,360
Can I see her?

718
01:10:08,440 --> 01:10:12,240
I don't know. Some hospitals
have rules about children.

719
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,960
- But I'll see later when I get there.
- Will she get better?

720
01:10:15,080 --> 01:10:17,880
Yeah, yeah.
Of course she will. Yes.

721
01:10:24,760 --> 01:10:27,120
Aren't you riding
with us?

722
01:10:27,200 --> 01:10:30,360
I've got some stuff
to do before school.

723
01:10:30,480 --> 01:10:32,280
You didn't eat anything yet.

724
01:10:39,600 --> 01:10:41,520
Good-bye.

725
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:54,760
- Bye, EI.
- Bye.

726
01:10:54,880 --> 01:10:58,760
- Maybe we'll try some takeout tonight.
- Yeah, maybe.

727
01:11:18,160 --> 01:11:20,040
Did you see it?

728
01:11:23,960 --> 01:11:27,400
Yes.

729
01:11:27,480 --> 01:11:29,880
It's beautiful, isn't it?

730
01:11:31,760 --> 01:11:33,560
I've never
seen anything like it.

731
01:11:37,920 --> 01:11:39,720
It's beginning
to hold the light.

732
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:46,120
- I'm sorry. I don't understand.
- The shards, putting them together.

733
01:11:46,240 --> 01:11:48,640
Tikkun olam-
to make things whole.

734
01:11:50,280 --> 01:11:53,840
Hold the light.
You showed me.

735
01:11:56,400 --> 01:11:59,280
Miriam, it-
It was a metaphor.

736
01:11:59,400 --> 01:12:01,280
A-A poem.

737
01:12:03,120 --> 01:12:05,400
Yes, a poem.
I made a poem.

738
01:12:14,400 --> 01:12:16,520
The police think that you took
all those things.

739
01:12:16,600 --> 01:12:21,840
- Some of them are mine- ours.
- And some aren't.

740
01:12:23,960 --> 01:12:25,800
I needed more.

741
01:12:25,880 --> 01:12:28,280
They said they found you
in another family's house.

742
01:12:30,480 --> 01:12:33,200
I need you to come home, honey.
Kids need you to come home.

743
01:12:35,440 --> 01:12:37,440
I don't want
to come home right now.

744
01:12:37,520 --> 01:12:39,440
They're not going
to prosecute.

745
01:12:39,520 --> 01:12:42,760
They just want to make sure that you
get some help. All you got to do...

746
01:12:42,840 --> 01:12:45,680
is you say you're sorry that you took
the things that didn't belong to you.

747
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,200
I'm not sorry.
It wasn't stealing.

748
01:12:48,320 --> 01:12:51,440
- Miriam, please, just-
- I thought maybe you'd understand.

749
01:12:51,560 --> 01:12:53,200
- I do understand. I do.
But I need you to come home.

750
01:12:53,320 --> 01:12:56,680
- Stop it. You don't understand.

751
01:12:56,800 --> 01:13:00,080
I can't go home
with you now, Saul.

752
01:13:02,800 --> 01:13:05,320
Look at me.

753
01:13:07,920 --> 01:13:09,840
What do you see?

754
01:13:14,640 --> 01:13:18,920
You-You love to talk-

755
01:13:19,040 --> 01:13:23,600
talk about things that don't-
that don't come from your heart.

756
01:13:23,720 --> 01:13:26,600
You talk and talk
and talk and talk.

757
01:13:31,920 --> 01:13:34,600
Are they all empty words?

758
01:13:38,840 --> 01:13:40,680
Do you want to understand?

759
01:13:41,760 --> 01:13:44,120
Understand me?

760
01:13:44,240 --> 01:13:46,120
This?

761
01:13:50,400 --> 01:13:52,200
That room, those things-

762
01:13:53,840 --> 01:13:56,080
It wasn't-

763
01:13:56,200 --> 01:13:59,440
Miriam, please.
Please, talk to me.

764
01:13:59,560 --> 01:14:01,400
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

765
01:14:01,520 --> 01:14:04,040
I-I want to go back
to my room now, please.

766
01:14:04,120 --> 01:14:06,080
Tell me what's wrong, please.

767
01:14:06,160 --> 01:14:09,160
I just wanted to hold
the light, that's all.

768
01:14:09,280 --> 01:14:11,600
I didn't do this
to hurt you.

769
01:14:18,720 --> 01:14:23,000
She took some things
she thought were hers, but they weren't.

770
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,120
The doctors are
working with her now.

771
01:14:26,200 --> 01:14:28,360
[Eliza]
She said she didn't want to see me?

772
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,800
Elly, she's-She's really not ready
to see anybody right now.

773
01:14:31,920 --> 01:14:34,760
She took all that stuff
and now we can't go to the finals.

774
01:14:36,800 --> 01:14:40,560
What are you talking about?
Who told you we're not going?

775
01:14:40,680 --> 01:14:44,280
It's my fault, isn't it?
That's why she's sick.

776
01:14:44,400 --> 01:14:49,720
No. That's-
That's not why she's-

777
01:14:49,840 --> 01:14:52,520
It is nobody's fault,
all right?

778
01:14:57,360 --> 01:15:00,320
We'll go to the finals,
and your mother will watch.

779
01:15:00,400 --> 01:15:03,080
It's on TV. We'll tell her
about it, okay?

780
01:15:03,200 --> 01:15:06,080
All right. Okay?

781
01:15:07,280 --> 01:15:11,880
- I'm sorry, baby.

782
01:15:12,000 --> 01:15:15,400
Yeah? Aaron, where are you?

783
01:15:16,680 --> 01:15:21,000
No, uh- No, they're
keeping her in the hospital.

784
01:15:21,120 --> 01:15:23,120
I'll explain when-
when you get home.

785
01:15:23,240 --> 01:15:26,640
Of course you will
be coming home. Where are you?

786
01:15:26,760 --> 01:15:30,960
Aaron? Where-

787
01:15:32,840 --> 01:15:34,640
I can't deal with this now.

788
01:15:36,560 --> 01:15:39,480
- Shit!

789
01:15:45,360 --> 01:15:49,480
Where am I calling?
The what?

790
01:15:49,640 --> 01:15:52,080
All right.
Stay in the car.

791
01:16:01,800 --> 01:16:03,640
- I've come for my son.

792
01:16:03,760 --> 01:16:05,960
- Yes?
- If you don't give him to me, I will call the police.

793
01:16:07,800 --> 01:16:09,480
- Come in.
- Right.

794
01:16:24,360 --> 01:16:26,600
Oh, Aaron.

795
01:16:26,720 --> 01:16:29,360
All right, get dressed.
We're going home.

796
01:16:29,480 --> 01:16:32,600
- I am dressed.
- Then let's go.

797
01:16:43,600 --> 01:16:46,200
- You can't keep me from coming back.
- Oh, really? Watch me.

798
01:16:46,320 --> 01:16:48,360
- I really can't believe you did this.
- Get in the car.

799
01:16:53,360 --> 01:16:55,440
Don't talk to me.

800
01:16:55,560 --> 01:16:57,840
Get back here.
You're acting like a child.

801
01:16:57,960 --> 01:16:59,760
- Eliza has more sense.
- Of course you think that.

802
01:16:59,880 --> 01:17:01,720
- She agrees with everything you
say. Talk about brainwashed.

803
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,320
- I'm not finished.

804
01:17:03,440 --> 01:17:04,400
- Don't walk away!
- You're going to stop me

805
01:17:04,440 --> 01:17:05,640
from going to my room now?

806
01:17:05,760 --> 01:17:08,040
- I want you to come here-
- You do not get to tell me what to do-

807
01:17:08,160 --> 01:17:09,600
- control what I feel or think.
- Stop it.

808
01:17:09,720 --> 01:17:11,560
- I'm not Eliza. I'm not Mom.
- Goddamn it!

809
01:17:11,640 --> 01:17:14,440
- You do not talk to me like that!
- You don't fucking control me!

810
01:17:16,360 --> 01:17:19,640
She's not even in the hospital, is she?
She just got tired of being here.

811
01:17:19,760 --> 01:17:23,880
Tired of you and your house
and your cooking and your religion...

812
01:17:24,000 --> 01:17:27,440
and your everything,
and you just can't face the truth.

813
01:17:29,880 --> 01:17:32,840
You want to know
the truth, Aaron?

814
01:17:32,960 --> 01:17:38,040
Your mother has been stealing things
for years. Maybe her whole life.

815
01:17:38,160 --> 01:17:40,040
She's very sick.
She's in a mental institution...

816
01:17:40,120 --> 01:17:44,200
and I don't know when or if
they will give her back to me.

817
01:17:44,320 --> 01:17:46,360
You're the one who's sick.

818
01:17:46,480 --> 01:17:48,440
- Me?
- Yeah, you.

819
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:50,920
Who's the one
who's walking around in a sheet?

820
01:17:51,000 --> 01:17:52,840
- In orange bedsheets.
- Stop it.

821
01:17:52,920 --> 01:17:55,920
- Aaron, you are a baby. You're a kid.
- Stop it! Stop it!

822
01:17:56,040 --> 01:17:58,640
You want to go to- Go to your room.
Go to your fucking room!

823
01:17:58,760 --> 01:18:00,760
- Go.
- Why can't you live your own stupid life?

824
01:18:00,880 --> 01:18:03,080
Why do you have to drag me
and Elly into it?

825
01:18:03,160 --> 01:18:05,080
Why can't you leave us alone?

826
01:18:11,520 --> 01:18:13,320
Aaron.

827
01:18:13,440 --> 01:18:15,240
Aaron?

828
01:18:17,920 --> 01:18:21,440
Please, God.
Please, please, please-

829
01:18:38,960 --> 01:18:41,680
We can talk-

830
01:18:41,800 --> 01:18:44,160
really connect with God.

831
01:18:44,280 --> 01:18:46,560
Notjust pray...

832
01:18:48,960 --> 01:18:50,800
but have God listen.

833
01:18:53,760 --> 01:18:57,720
And sometimes
in special cases...

834
01:19:03,280 --> 01:19:05,440
have God talk back.

835
01:19:17,240 --> 01:19:21,160
Got it?
Okay, this way.

that she knows I called.

845
01:19:56,800 --> 01:20:00,840
All right. Thank you.

846
01:20:04,280 --> 01:20:06,440
Dad?

847
01:20:06,520 --> 01:20:10,480
Hey. Hey, you were incredible
up there today.

848
01:20:10,600 --> 01:20:12,400
Thanks.

849
01:20:12,520 --> 01:20:15,320
- What's your brother doing?
- Watching TV.

850
01:20:15,440 --> 01:20:17,480
You want to try a few more,
just to keep loose?

851
01:20:17,600 --> 01:20:20,080
Mmm, I don't know. Okay.

01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:51,280
O-R-I...

859
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:56,480
G-A-M...

860
01:20:59,760 --> 01:21:01,600
I.

861
01:21:09,040 --> 01:21:10,920
You can do this.

862
01:21:14,080 --> 01:21:16,040
Yes, you can.

863
01:21:19,160 --> 01:21:21,000
He should leave you alone.

864
01:21:21,080 --> 01:21:25,560
- It's okay.
- Hejust wants this for himself.

865
01:21:25,680 --> 01:21:28,080
You know, he's using you,
like he used Mom...

866
01:21:28,200 --> 01:21:30,840
and like he used me.

867
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,160
I just think you should
forget about him.

868
01:21:33,240 --> 01:21:36,040
That's all I mean.

869
01:21:36,160 --> 01:21:40,680
He needs this-all the attention
and the control-

870
01:21:40,800 --> 01:21:43,520
and he doesn't even know it.

871
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,960
He needs Mom.

872
01:22:33,840 --> 01:22:36,680
What are you doing down here
this time of night?

873
01:22:36,800 --> 01:22:39,760
I want to see
the television cameras.

874
01:22:39,880 --> 01:22:42,360
You in that spelling
contest tomorrow?

875
01:22:53,040 --> 01:22:55,440
- I don't see them.
- The cameras?

876
01:22:55,560 --> 01:22:58,680
I guess they don't
bring them till the morning.

877
01:23:02,240 --> 01:23:06,440
You better get back to sleep before your
mother comes down here looking for you.

878
01:23:06,520 --> 01:23:09,600
She won't.
I need to win first.

879
01:23:09,680 --> 01:23:13,240
Don't be silly. Nobody's mother
needs her to win anything.

880
01:23:31,360 --> 01:23:34,320
Go slowly.
The path is dangerous-

881
01:23:34,440 --> 01:23:36,280
The path is dangerous.

882
01:23:36,400 --> 01:23:38,800
- And must be traveled with caution.
- With caution.

883
01:23:41,160 --> 01:23:45,000
The words in this notebook
are very, very powerful.

884
01:23:57,800 --> 01:23:59,680
Permute the letters back and forth.

885
01:23:59,800 --> 01:24:02,400
Permute the letters back and forth.

886
01:24:08,760 --> 01:24:12,200
This will arouse in you
many words, one after the other.

887
01:24:16,120 --> 01:24:18,000
The light.

888
01:24:18,120 --> 01:24:21,120
You will feel then
as if an additional spirit is within you.

889
01:24:21,200 --> 01:24:25,200
Light, light, light, light.

890
01:24:25,320 --> 01:24:29,080
L-l-G-H-T, light.
- Light, light, light-

891
01:24:29,200 --> 01:24:31,800
Cleanse. Heart.

892
01:24:31,920 --> 01:24:36,680
L-l-G-H-T, L-l-G-H-T,
L-l-G-H-T-

893
01:24:39,720 --> 01:24:42,520
Let God flow through you.

894
01:24:42,640 --> 01:24:45,480
I want to reach the ear of God.

895
01:24:57,720 --> 01:25:00,200
- To reach the ear of God-
- I want to talk to God.

896
01:25:11,280 --> 01:25:13,080
The sounds.

897
01:25:18,640 --> 01:25:20,560
The letters.

898
01:25:23,120 --> 01:25:26,880
The letters.
The sound.

899
01:27:12,280 --> 01:27:15,160
Elly? Hey, Elly.

900
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:19,720
You okay?
What happened?

901
01:27:21,680 --> 01:27:24,680
It's 7.30.
We've got to get you cleaned up.

902
01:27:24,800 --> 01:27:27,160
- Come on. Let's get you ready for the-

903
01:27:27,280 --> 01:27:32,960
Everybody up?
I got orangejuice, croissants.

904
01:27:33,040 --> 01:27:37,800
This is it, kiddo.
This is the one.

905
01:27:37,880 --> 01:27:39,720
Come on. Let me help you.

906
01:27:56,880 --> 01:28:01,360
These are the final rounds, and
they're on national television.

907
01:28:01,480 --> 01:28:06,280
Everyone up here is already
a champion. So let's have some fun.

The rules require that the next speller

Congratulations.
Ladies and gentlemen...

986
01:34:32,600 --> 01:34:35,600
the new national spelling bee champion
from Denver, Colorado.

987
01:34:48,880 --> 01:34:53,160
My father told me once
that I could reach the ear of God-

988
01:34:53,280 --> 01:34:57,520
that words and letters would guide me
to reach beyond myself...

989
01:34:57,640 --> 01:35:01,200
to know the world
as whole again.

990
01:35:01,320 --> 01:35:06,520
And like the ancient mystics,
God will flow through me.

991
01:35:16,880 --> 01:35:20,120
And we would be together.

992
01:35:22,120 --> 01:35:25,200
She's my daughter.
