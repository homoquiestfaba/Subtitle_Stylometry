00:03:05,252 --> 00:03:06,385
Hey, Mom.

3
00:03:06,387 --> 00:03:08,788
Hey! Where did you find
this stranger?

4
00:03:08,790 --> 00:03:10,056
Found him on the road.

5
00:03:10,058 --> 00:03:13,325
Is it okay if I use your car?
I really need to get to work.

6
00:03:13,327 --> 00:03:15,594
- Sure.
- Yeah?

7
00:03:15,596 --> 00:03:19,298
You don't wanna stay and help us finish
off the last of Bambi with this stew?

8
00:03:19,300 --> 00:03:22,035
I'd love to, I have to go.
Dad, thank you.

9
00:03:22,037 --> 00:03:23,404
Have a good one.

10
00:03:28,443 --> 00:03:29,610
How was it?

11
00:03:30,545 --> 00:03:32,413
Yeah, wasn't too bad.

12
00:03:34,550 --> 00:03:35,584
Hey...

13
00:03:37,052 --> 00:03:39,588
you're gonna have to
say a few words tonight.

14
00:03:42,024 --> 00:03:43,325
How many?

15
00:03:44,560 --> 00:03:45,992
Well...

16
00:03:45,994 --> 00:03:49,496
Lincoln did, what,
282 for the Gettysburg Address.

17
00:03:49,498 --> 00:03:50,933
So, 100?

18
00:03:55,471 --> 00:03:57,571
Come on, they're just
trying to thank you.

19
00:03:57,573 --> 00:03:59,441
It's not gonna be
a firing squad.

20
00:04:00,676 --> 00:04:02,411
That would be
over quick, though.

21
00:04:20,697 --> 00:04:21,898
Is that new?

22
00:04:22,899 --> 00:04:24,267
No.

23
00:04:25,702 --> 00:04:27,370
Just tuck it there.

24
00:04:50,795 --> 00:04:52,530
Um...

25
00:04:53,931 --> 00:04:57,432
Um, I'm... I'm no speech giver.

26
00:04:57,434 --> 00:05:02,940
But I sure as heck am very honored to
be named Kehoe's Citizen of the Year.

27
00:05:03,507 --> 00:05:06,011
However, if... if
it were up to me...

28
00:05:06,744 --> 00:05:09,647
I'd give it to
somebody more important.

29
00:05:10,681 --> 00:05:12,748
Uh... I'm a...

30
00:05:12,750 --> 00:05:16,085
I'm just a guy who keeps a strip

31
00:05:16,087 --> 00:05:19,925
of civilization open through
the wilderness for people.

32
00:05:21,425 --> 00:05:22,527
Hmm...

33
00:05:22,828 --> 00:05:23,995
When you...

34
00:05:26,031 --> 00:05:28,665
when you drive the same road
day after day,

35
00:05:28,667 --> 00:05:34,406
it's... easy to start thinking
about the road not taken.

36
00:05:36,441 --> 00:05:39,611
I try not to do that.
You see...

37
00:05:40,545 --> 00:05:41,746
I was lucky.

38
00:05:43,481 --> 00:05:45,852
I picked a good road early...

39
00:05:46,919 --> 00:05:48,886
and I stayed on it.

40
00:06:35,569 --> 00:06:37,004
Hey, kid. How was your day?

41
00:06:37,571 --> 00:06:39,539
Easy!

42
00:06:41,174 --> 00:06:43,541
Kyle. Kyle!

43
00:06:43,543 --> 00:06:44,509
Shut up!

44
00:06:44,511 --> 00:06:46,546
- Help!
- Shut up!

45
00:06:51,685 --> 00:06:52,987
Get his arms!

46
00:06:53,553 --> 00:06:55,187
- Get his belt!
- I got it.

47
00:06:55,189 --> 00:06:56,657
Pull it down.

48
00:07:00,594 --> 00:07:01,930
Help!

49
00:07:24,886 --> 00:07:25,954
Shit.

50
00:07:57,619 --> 00:08:00,090
- What's going on?
- I don't wanna go.

51
00:08:01,590 --> 00:08:04,693
Hey, I know you're smart
but you're not that smart.

52
00:08:05,694 --> 00:08:07,063
Uh, hey.

53
00:08:12,335 --> 00:08:14,971
- Doesn't wanna go.
- Ah, shit.

54
00:08:16,106 --> 00:08:18,975
Let me guess,
this is about Tim, right?

55
00:08:20,210 --> 00:08:22,212
Ryan's got a bully in his class.

56
00:08:23,847 --> 00:08:26,616
Tim rubbed his face
in the dirt yesterday.

57
00:08:27,283 --> 00:08:28,852
Do you know what a bully is?

58
00:08:29,919 --> 00:08:32,020
It's a chance
to prove your mettle.

59
00:08:32,022 --> 00:08:34,189
Now, you don't wanna
waste those chances in life.

60
00:08:34,191 --> 00:08:36,893
- He's a lot bigger than I am.
- Yeah, even better.

61
00:08:37,594 --> 00:08:39,163
Are you saying
I should hit him?

62
00:08:39,929 --> 00:08:41,662
Yeah, for a start.

63
00:08:41,664 --> 00:08:44,534
- That's not a very good idea.
- Oh yeah, why not?

64
00:08:45,735 --> 00:08:48,072
Because then I'll be
as stupid as he is.

65
00:08:49,240 --> 00:08:51,008
Listen... come here, come here.

66
00:08:53,310 --> 00:08:55,778
I gave you <i>Lord of the Flies</i>
for your birthday.

67
00:08:55,780 --> 00:08:58,049
I'll bet you haven't
even started it yet.

68
00:08:58,949 --> 00:09:00,718
Well, then that's too bad.

69
00:09:01,852 --> 00:09:04,555
All the answers you'll ever need
are in that book.

70
00:09:05,089 --> 00:09:06,857
Come on, time to go.

71
00:09:17,802 --> 00:09:20,170
You were a real wild man last night.

72
00:09:20,172 --> 00:09:23,641
- There's no one crazier than you, buddy.
- Who knew you could dance.

73
00:09:25,676 --> 00:09:28,847
- Ah, good times, huh?
- Tell you what, we'll do this again, huh.

74
00:09:29,848 --> 00:09:31,214
Yeah!

75
00:09:31,216 --> 00:09:33,952
You look good.
Get you some breakfast.

76
00:10:27,074 --> 00:10:28,841
Jesus, Grace.

77
00:11:38,846 --> 00:11:40,149
Your son?

78
00:12:00,970 --> 00:12:02,972
He died of a heroin overdose.

79
00:12:20,190 --> 00:12:22,192
Um, excuse me.

80
00:12:23,927 --> 00:12:26,263
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

81
00:12:30,333 --> 00:12:31,935
Sorry,
but all the parents say that.

82
00:12:33,436 --> 00:12:35,772
But he... he wasn't a druggie.

83
00:12:36,873 --> 00:12:38,908
What... what are you gonna do?

84
00:12:39,310 --> 00:12:42,178
I'll be turning it
over to Vice and Narcotics.

85
00:12:44,515 --> 00:12:46,883
We didn't know our own son.

86
00:12:52,523 --> 00:12:54,256
Kyle wasn't a druggie.

87
00:12:54,258 --> 00:12:57,028
You're not listening!

88
00:13:24,256 --> 00:13:27,592
He leadeth me to the paths
of righteousness for His name's sake.

89
00:13:28,927 --> 00:13:31,995
Yea, though I walk through the
valley of the shadow of death,

90
00:13:31,997 --> 00:13:34,966
I shall fear no evil
for thou art with me...

91
00:13:43,108 --> 00:13:45,143
Thou anointest
my head with oil.

92
00:13:47,079 --> 00:13:48,514
My cup runneth over.

93
00:13:49,615 --> 00:13:51,981
Surely goodness and mercy
shall follow me

94
00:13:51,983 --> 00:13:53,584
all the days of my life.

95
00:13:53,586 --> 00:13:56,422
And I shall dwell in the house
of the Lord forever.

96
00:15:21,276 --> 00:15:22,677
Hmm?

97
00:15:23,411 --> 00:15:24,446
Nels?

98
00:15:26,247 --> 00:15:27,415
Dante?

99
00:15:28,516 --> 00:15:29,517
Dante?

100
00:15:30,084 --> 00:15:31,520
I'm sorry, Nels.

101
00:15:34,523 --> 00:15:36,057
I'm really sorry.

102
00:15:36,559 --> 00:15:38,427
It wasn't supposed
to end like this.

103
00:15:39,662 --> 00:15:44,467
I know where and when
the cocaine arrives.

104
00:15:47,736 --> 00:15:52,107
Kyle didn't know about any of this.
That's the truth.

105
00:15:52,508 --> 00:15:54,508
It was just one bag.

106
00:15:54,510 --> 00:15:56,345
Just one bag!

107
00:15:57,546 --> 00:16:01,081
But people like that,
they always find out.

108
00:16:01,083 --> 00:16:04,019
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
What people?

109
00:16:05,789 --> 00:16:07,524
What people do you mean?

110
00:16:08,224 --> 00:16:09,291
Um...

111
00:16:12,194 --> 00:16:15,231
Do you have...
do you have any cash?

112
00:16:16,266 --> 00:16:19,234
- If they find me, they'll hurt me!
- What people!

113
00:16:19,236 --> 00:16:22,370
- Please! Please!
- What people do you mean?

114
00:16:22,372 --> 00:16:24,305
Speedo,
there's a guy named Speedo.

115
00:16:24,307 --> 00:16:26,107
- Speedo?
- He's the only one I know!

116
00:16:26,109 --> 00:16:27,809
Just tell me
where I can find this guy

117
00:16:27,811 --> 00:16:30,445
and then you get the hell out of here!

118
00:16:30,447 --> 00:16:31,081
Where is he?

119
00:18:14,220 --> 00:18:15,822
So, you're Speedo?

120
00:18:16,656 --> 00:18:18,491
Bingo, gold star.

121
00:18:21,829 --> 00:18:23,697
Dante says hello.

122
00:18:26,432 --> 00:18:28,234
I don't know any Dantes.

123
00:18:28,602 --> 00:18:30,571
Yes, you do.

124
00:18:32,205 --> 00:18:36,377
He worked at the Kehoe airport
with my son... Kyle.

125
00:18:37,578 --> 00:18:38,910
You know him too.

126
00:18:43,450 --> 00:18:44,485
Kyle?

127
00:18:46,387 --> 00:18:49,289
Oh, yeah.
Kyle, that's your kid?

128
00:18:49,823 --> 00:18:53,394
Yeah, yeah, I, uh...
No, I don't know him. Sorry.

129
00:18:53,862 --> 00:18:57,297
I know a lot of people,
I know a lot of... Kyles.

130
00:18:57,932 --> 00:18:59,500
Tell me what happened.

131
00:19:07,809 --> 00:19:09,341
Tell me.

132
00:19:09,343 --> 00:19:11,811
All right, Pops.
There's the door, all right?

133
00:19:11,813 --> 00:19:15,250
I don't know what igloo you crawled out of
but I think it's time you crawled back in.

134
00:19:16,618 --> 00:19:19,788
And trust me,
that's your, uh, best move.

135
00:19:23,324 --> 00:19:24,392
Okay?

136
00:19:55,458 --> 00:19:57,259
You have my phone?

137
00:20:01,397 --> 00:20:03,666
Tell me what happened.

138
00:20:14,611 --> 00:20:15,846
I was...

139
00:20:16,747 --> 00:20:18,713
I was just taking orders.

140
00:20:18,715 --> 00:20:20,316
Taking orders from who?

141
00:20:20,717 --> 00:20:21,752
Who!

142
00:20:22,419 --> 00:20:24,354
- Limbo.
- Huh?

143
00:20:25,021 --> 00:20:26,990
- Limbo.
- Limbo?

144
00:20:28,091 --> 00:20:29,292
Limbo.

145
00:20:29,593 --> 00:20:30,627
Limbo.

146
00:20:31,628 --> 00:20:32,662
Limbo...

147
00:20:35,732 --> 00:20:37,868
Is that him? That Limbo?

148
00:21:43,402 --> 00:21:47,437
<i>No doubt about it, Dan Reeves
was at least in the top three best coaches.</i>

149
00:21:47,439 --> 00:21:50,908
<i>And since we're strolling down
memory lane at the Mile High Stadium,</i>

150
00:21:50,910 --> 00:21:53,577
<i>here's a late night question
for you, Denver.</i>

151
00:21:53,579 --> 00:21:56,646
<i>Greatest quarterback ever,
Elway or Manning?</i>

152
00:21:56,648 --> 00:21:59,984
<i>Give me a call on 555-2395.</i>

153
00:21:59,986 --> 00:22:01,020
Elway.

154
00:22:51,206 --> 00:22:53,474
Aren't you gonna ask
where I've been?

155
00:23:05,153 --> 00:23:07,155
Uh, Speedo's missing.

156
00:23:19,668 --> 00:23:21,436
Who's Speedo?

157
00:23:21,903 --> 00:23:24,771
One of my employees.
But you wouldn't know about him,

158
00:23:24,773 --> 00:23:28,743
because we don't talk about business
on the way to school, do we?

159
00:23:38,988 --> 00:23:40,423
Who packed these?

160
00:23:43,159 --> 00:23:46,226
- Didn't think a treat would kill him.
- High fructose corn syrup.

161
00:23:46,228 --> 00:23:47,663
Lecithin.

162
00:23:48,297 --> 00:23:49,732
Baking soda?

163
00:23:51,701 --> 00:23:53,936
The only thing not in those
is rat poison.

164
00:23:57,540 --> 00:23:58,808
I want you to know...

165
00:23:59,942 --> 00:24:01,644
I had no hand in this.

166
00:24:09,952 --> 00:24:11,921
I say make them all legal.

167
00:24:12,655 --> 00:24:14,191
Meth, ex, opium.

168
00:24:16,059 --> 00:24:19,096
An opium den in every mall,
that's my platform.

169
00:24:21,164 --> 00:24:26,136
Give the people what they want. Tax the
shit out of it, then double our pay.

170
00:24:28,171 --> 00:24:30,905
- What do you think about that?
- No thanks.

171
00:24:30,907 --> 00:24:35,710
I wanna be able to tell the good guys from the
bad guys. That way I'll know who to shoot.

172
00:24:39,883 --> 00:24:41,551
Nels Coxman.

173
00:24:42,220 --> 00:24:43,887
Citizen of the Year.

174
00:24:44,988 --> 00:24:46,491
Good for him.

175
00:24:50,061 --> 00:24:52,629
It's a real word, you know,
cocksman.

176
00:24:52,964 --> 00:24:56,631
It means "a man adept
at the art of fornication."

177
00:24:56,633 --> 00:24:57,668
Nice.

178
00:25:01,839 --> 00:25:02,838
You see these guys?

179
00:25:08,079 --> 00:25:10,246
Whoa. Whoa, hey...

180
00:25:10,248 --> 00:25:12,216
It's just weed.

181
00:25:13,352 --> 00:25:15,951
Yeah, it's legal to purchase,
legal to smoke at home.

182
00:25:15,953 --> 00:25:18,121
Take a breath.
Come on, breathe.

183
00:25:18,123 --> 00:25:20,623
There's a principle
you need to get on board with

184
00:25:20,625 --> 00:25:24,727
if you intend to survive and
advance in Kehoe law enforcement.

185
00:25:24,729 --> 00:25:26,897
It's called community policing.

186
00:25:26,899 --> 00:25:31,835
Wherein we embrace and enforce
the values of our community.

187
00:25:31,837 --> 00:25:34,037
The values of them
giving us the finger?

188
00:25:34,039 --> 00:25:39,009
We're a ski town. Folks come here to
ski, have sex and get high.

189
00:25:39,011 --> 00:25:40,877
So lighten up.

190
00:25:40,879 --> 00:25:42,815
Here, you wanna get your Dirty Harry on?

191
00:25:46,785 --> 00:25:48,254
The meter just hit zero.

192
00:25:49,355 --> 00:25:50,889
Get rid of the gum.

193
00:26:49,717 --> 00:26:51,950
So, what can I do for you, boss?

194
00:26:51,952 --> 00:26:53,719
Uh, I'm...

195
00:26:53,721 --> 00:26:55,888
I'll be right with you.

196
00:26:55,890 --> 00:26:57,992
- Just can't believe this is happening.
- Give me one second.

197
00:27:00,728 --> 00:27:02,197
What's the verdict back here?

198
00:27:05,367 --> 00:27:06,268
Wow.

199
00:27:07,102 --> 00:27:09,104
It's absolutely stunning.

200
00:27:09,471 --> 00:27:12,505
Hmm. Yeah,
I can't believe this.

201
00:27:12,507 --> 00:27:15,377
I love the detail
in the lace. The shape.

202
00:27:15,844 --> 00:27:17,810
- It's so elegant, right?
- Yes.

203
00:27:17,812 --> 00:27:20,715
No, I absolutely
love it. I think this is it.

204
00:27:24,186 --> 00:27:26,452
- I think I'm gonna cry.
- It's so stupid.

205
00:27:26,454 --> 00:27:27,954
You look absolutely...

206
00:27:27,956 --> 00:27:30,757
I'll throw in the veil
at no extra charge.

207
00:27:30,759 --> 00:27:32,326
Wow!

208
00:27:32,328 --> 00:27:34,363
- Congratulations.
- Thanks for everything.

209
00:27:34,963 --> 00:27:36,365
It feels surreal.

210
00:27:39,302 --> 00:27:41,337
All right.
How can I help you, boss?

211
00:27:42,438 --> 00:27:47,109
Uh, I'm, uh,
I'm looking for a tux.

212
00:27:48,878 --> 00:27:51,347
You got it. When is the wedding?

213
00:27:54,350 --> 00:27:56,819
It's not a wedding. My...

214
00:27:57,420 --> 00:28:01,190
my wife and I,
we're renewing our vows.

215
00:28:04,427 --> 00:28:06,095
Still going strong, huh?

216
00:28:08,264 --> 00:28:09,832
That's what I like to hear.

217
00:28:11,067 --> 00:28:13,836
- How's about we get you measured, huh?
- Sure.

218
00:28:22,079 --> 00:28:23,979
You killed my boy.

219
00:28:23,981 --> 00:28:26,250
Who told you to do it?

220
00:28:31,555 --> 00:28:32,587
Who?

221
00:28:32,589 --> 00:28:34,389
Santa. Santa.

222
00:28:34,391 --> 00:28:36,424
- "Santa"?
- That's what he goes by.

223
00:28:40,030 --> 00:28:41,765
Where can I find this "Santa"?

224
00:28:46,903 --> 00:28:49,170
There's a little airport
in Kehoe.

225
00:28:49,172 --> 00:28:51,340
He flies in with the coke
and out with the money.

226
00:28:51,342 --> 00:28:52,809
What does he look like?

227
00:28:53,378 --> 00:28:55,046
He looks like a Santa.

228
00:28:56,414 --> 00:29:00,449
No! Come on, please. You don't
have to do that. Come on, please.

229
00:29:09,227 --> 00:29:10,528
Elway or Manning?

230
00:29:14,966 --> 00:29:16,067
What?

231
00:29:16,568 --> 00:29:20,104
Greatest quarterback ever.
Elway or Manning?

232
00:29:26,312 --> 00:29:27,313
Elway.

233
00:30:10,190 --> 00:30:12,859
Did you know Kyle
had a Facebook?

234
00:30:17,330 --> 00:30:18,965
Do you know his favorite band?

235
00:30:23,203 --> 00:30:25,939
He posted his favorite movies,
do you know those?

236
00:30:30,243 --> 00:30:33,280
What'd the two of you talk about
on your damn hunting trips?

237
00:30:38,519 --> 00:30:39,520
Hunting.

238
00:30:53,200 --> 00:30:54,235
Damn it.

239
00:30:54,568 --> 00:30:55,603
Goddamn.

240
00:31:03,545 --> 00:31:04,513
Damn it!

241
00:31:08,583 --> 00:31:10,383
That's the fourth gym bag
you've lost.

242
00:31:10,385 --> 00:31:11,919
Yeah,
but who's counting, right?

243
00:31:14,523 --> 00:31:16,523
You might find this
hard to believe

244
00:31:16,525 --> 00:31:19,192
but I've got more important things
to do than keep track of gym bags.

245
00:31:19,194 --> 00:31:21,930
Like earning the money
to pay for them.

246
00:31:22,397 --> 00:31:23,465
Tell you what...

247
00:31:23,732 --> 00:31:25,598
why don't you take this

248
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,469
and buy him every single
goddamn gym bag he'll ever need.

249
00:31:29,471 --> 00:31:30,673
Does that work for you?

250
00:31:34,677 --> 00:31:35,977
All right.

251
00:31:36,478 --> 00:31:37,979
Well, that's for you.

252
00:31:40,382 --> 00:31:42,516
- Tell me this is a joke.
- No.

253
00:31:42,518 --> 00:31:44,520
That's Ryan's new diet.
And you're gonna follow it to the letter.

254
00:31:44,787 --> 00:31:47,788
Breakfast: grass-fed beef,
asparagus, cashews.

255
00:31:47,790 --> 00:31:50,291
Lunch, the same.
Dinner, the same.

256
00:31:50,293 --> 00:31:53,527
Yeah, that's on Mondays. Tuesday it
rotates. Chicken, broccoli and almonds.

257
00:31:53,529 --> 00:31:55,164
For breakfast, lunch and dinner?

258
00:31:56,632 --> 00:31:59,200
You want our son to eat the
same thing three times a day?

259
00:31:59,202 --> 00:32:02,269
Eighty percent of our immune
system starts in the gut.

260
00:32:02,271 --> 00:32:05,172
Keep it simple in the gut,
you get to live a long life.

261
00:32:05,174 --> 00:32:07,577
A week on this diet
and he'll wanna kill himself.

262
00:32:08,211 --> 00:32:09,578
And I'll help him do it.

263
00:32:09,580 --> 00:32:11,447
You know what,
you should be grateful.

264
00:32:13,015 --> 00:32:16,518
My dad started my day with half a
grapefruit and three lines of primo coke.

265
00:32:16,520 --> 00:32:18,553
"Breakfast of champions,"
he called it.

266
00:32:18,555 --> 00:32:21,991
And now your son can't look at a
candy bar without breaking into hives.

267
00:32:22,626 --> 00:32:25,094
Congratulations,
you've broken the cycle.

268
00:32:26,163 --> 00:32:27,231
And to think...

269
00:32:31,235 --> 00:32:33,570
I used to love the mouth on you.

270
00:32:34,638 --> 00:32:36,273
I've spoken to my lawyer.

271
00:32:37,241 --> 00:32:40,177
We want a new arrangement.
Ten days with me, four with you.

272
00:32:41,478 --> 00:32:42,446
Huh.

273
00:32:43,748 --> 00:32:47,783
Here's my counter offer.
Fourteen days with me and none with you.

274
00:32:47,785 --> 00:32:50,053
Let's see what your lawyer
thinks about that.

275
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:57,060
- Morning, Aya.
- Hey, Mustang.

276
00:33:04,636 --> 00:33:06,337
They say Limbo's disappeared.

277
00:33:21,185 --> 00:33:23,187
Don't worry about it,
he'll get over it.

278
00:33:26,725 --> 00:33:28,092
Is that Mozart?

279
00:33:29,395 --> 00:33:33,265
Bach. You can always tell Bach
because he's really mathematical.

280
00:33:34,466 --> 00:33:36,800
- Is he the one with all the kids?
- Yeah, 20.

281
00:33:40,539 --> 00:33:42,675
It's a wonder he found
any time to compose.

282
00:33:43,509 --> 00:33:45,644
I need your help
with my fantasy football.

283
00:33:46,445 --> 00:33:48,480
I can't... I can't win a game.

284
00:33:52,318 --> 00:33:53,419
Playing for money?

285
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:57,624
Yeah, of course
I'm playing for money.

286
00:34:00,326 --> 00:34:02,762
You got four Cleveland Browns
on your team.

287
00:34:03,697 --> 00:34:05,197
Well, they're my home team.

288
00:34:06,333 --> 00:34:07,767
What's a man without loyalty?

289
00:34:10,737 --> 00:34:12,305
I can't help you.

290
00:35:54,610 --> 00:35:56,877
Hey, there's not enough
room to pass,

291
00:35:56,879 --> 00:36:00,216
I was wondering if you'd
back down to the turnoff?

292
00:36:07,390 --> 00:36:09,258
Any chance you could back up?

293
00:36:12,662 --> 00:36:15,665
Um, just between you and me,
right?

294
00:36:16,399 --> 00:36:17,735
Me, you and frosty.

295
00:36:19,335 --> 00:36:20,336
Sure.

296
00:36:29,646 --> 00:36:33,782
You have no clue
who you're messing with, man.

297
00:36:33,784 --> 00:36:35,252
Who am I messing with?

298
00:36:37,321 --> 00:36:39,423
You're dust, pal.

299
00:36:47,731 --> 00:36:48,764
Tell me.

300
00:36:51,002 --> 00:36:53,637
You're wasting your time.

301
00:37:07,418 --> 00:37:10,622
Are you tired, old man?

302
00:37:14,392 --> 00:37:15,393
Yeah.

303
00:38:27,601 --> 00:38:28,735
Grace?

304
00:38:30,938 --> 00:38:32,139
Grace?

305
00:39:52,655 --> 00:39:54,057
What are you doing here?

306
00:39:55,959 --> 00:39:57,026
Kyle's dead.

307
00:39:59,028 --> 00:40:00,229
Somebody killed him.

308
00:40:01,597 --> 00:40:03,099
What's that got to do with me?

309
00:40:04,300 --> 00:40:05,668
Can I come in?

310
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:17,880
Better take your shoes off. She'll
skin you alive.

311
00:40:18,881 --> 00:40:20,848
I'm going to make
some phone calls.

312
00:40:20,850 --> 00:40:22,552
Find out what happened to Kyle.

313
00:40:56,820 --> 00:40:59,290
She thinks you're one
of the guys from the old days.

314
00:40:59,824 --> 00:41:00,892
Don't worry about her.

315
00:41:02,227 --> 00:41:06,698
Kyle. He got mixed up with some
clown by the name of Dante.

316
00:41:06,998 --> 00:41:09,766
And they stole
a kilo of coke from Viking.

317
00:41:09,768 --> 00:41:12,670
- Who's Viking?
- Drug dealer. A big one.

318
00:41:13,104 --> 00:41:16,674
- You know him?
- Yeah, when he was a snot-nosed kid.

319
00:41:17,142 --> 00:41:20,810
- I knew his old man, Bullitt.
- Dad knew him, too?

320
00:41:20,812 --> 00:41:25,251
Whenever Bullitt had rough stuff to be done,
that was his go-to guy. After Dad, me.

321
00:41:25,950 --> 00:41:27,719
And then Viking took over.

322
00:41:28,120 --> 00:41:30,287
Viking's a whole
different breed.

323
00:41:30,289 --> 00:41:31,991
He likes hurting people.

324
00:41:34,393 --> 00:41:36,095
I'm gonna kill him, Brock.

325
00:41:39,131 --> 00:41:40,266
Sure you are.

326
00:41:41,934 --> 00:41:43,936
What makes you think
you can kill a man?

327
00:41:48,274 --> 00:41:49,275
I've...

328
00:41:50,109 --> 00:41:52,211
I've killed three of his guys.

329
00:41:53,813 --> 00:41:55,614
What did you do with the bodies?

330
00:41:56,082 --> 00:41:59,051
Wrapped them in chicken wire,
threw them on the gorge.

331
00:42:01,121 --> 00:42:04,055
- Chicken wire?
- Yeah, to let the fish get at them.

332
00:42:04,057 --> 00:42:06,657
They'll eat the flesh
off the bones.

333
00:42:06,659 --> 00:42:08,927
So the bodies don't fill
with gas and rise.

334
00:42:08,929 --> 00:42:10,864
They stay at the bottom.

335
00:42:12,766 --> 00:42:16,303
- Where did you learn that?
- I read it in a crime novel.

336
00:42:29,983 --> 00:42:32,752
- He is my brother.
- Brother?

337
00:42:33,421 --> 00:42:34,754
My ass.

338
00:42:39,960 --> 00:42:42,696
I know.

339
00:42:50,004 --> 00:42:51,772
- Maybe I should...
- Shut up.

340
00:42:58,312 --> 00:42:59,780
You stay out of trouble.

341
00:43:03,718 --> 00:43:05,720
The things we do for love, huh?

342
00:43:06,355 --> 00:43:08,954
She was skimming the till
at a massage parlor.

343
00:43:08,956 --> 00:43:11,293
They sent me to beat the shit
out of her. Instead...

344
00:43:12,294 --> 00:43:13,395
How's Grace?

345
00:43:15,297 --> 00:43:16,797
She left.

346
00:43:17,732 --> 00:43:20,033
The lady's got good timing,
I'll give her that.

347
00:43:20,035 --> 00:43:21,736
How do I find this Viking?

348
00:43:22,737 --> 00:43:23,704
You don't.

349
00:43:25,107 --> 00:43:28,977
- You've gone as far up the ladder as you're gonna go.
- We'll see.

350
00:43:30,445 --> 00:43:33,880
One guy can disappear.
Two? I don't think so.

351
00:43:33,882 --> 00:43:36,919
Three? With ten keys of coke?

352
00:43:37,520 --> 00:43:39,688
Maybe they were
all in it together.

353
00:43:47,197 --> 00:43:50,033
You think three of my dealers
ran out on me?

354
00:43:50,966 --> 00:43:54,870
That would make me the worst judge of
character in the Rockies, that's your theory?

355
00:43:57,840 --> 00:43:59,008
- No.
- No.

356
00:44:03,279 --> 00:44:06,214
It was those goddamn Indians.

357
00:44:06,216 --> 00:44:08,849
This is all my father's fault
for getting into bed with them.

358
00:44:08,851 --> 00:44:10,351
I'm sorry, the Indians?

359
00:44:10,353 --> 00:44:12,353
When Viking's father
was first getting started,

360
00:44:12,355 --> 00:44:14,922
he made a deal with an
Indian named White Bull.

361
00:44:14,924 --> 00:44:17,225
He supplied him,
White Bull dealt on the reservation.

362
00:44:17,227 --> 00:44:19,494
Until White Bull
wanted more turf.

363
00:44:19,496 --> 00:44:23,265
- So he tossed White Bull a few piece of crap towns.
- Like Kehoe.

364
00:44:23,267 --> 00:44:26,936
And Kehoe builds a ski resort.
Turns it into a gold mine.

365
00:44:27,371 --> 00:44:30,305
What's the one thing
history's taught us?

366
00:44:30,307 --> 00:44:33,410
You keep those Indians
on the reservation.

367
00:44:34,411 --> 00:44:37,879
Those Indians,
they're always wanting more.

368
00:44:37,881 --> 00:44:40,251
Because they think the turf
was theirs all along.

369
00:44:40,517 --> 00:44:42,419
Might kinda have
a point there, right.

370
00:44:56,900 --> 00:44:59,337
White Bull gave this
to my father...

371
00:45:00,205 --> 00:45:02,274
the day they shook
on their deal.

372
00:45:04,009 --> 00:45:05,110
Yeah.

373
00:45:06,511 --> 00:45:08,546
It's time we give it
back to him.

374
00:45:15,887 --> 00:45:19,989
- What can I do for you two?
- You could sit down with us. Tell us your story.

375
00:45:19,991 --> 00:45:24,463
- I got other customers.
- Yeah, that's funny. All I can see in here is you.

376
00:45:25,163 --> 00:45:27,098
Please tell me you work nights.

377
00:45:27,566 --> 00:45:29,500
Thursdays. Why?

378
00:45:29,502 --> 00:45:32,369
You look this good in sunlight,
I gotta see you after dark.

379
00:45:32,371 --> 00:45:35,441
Eggs, bacon, pancakes.

380
00:45:35,974 --> 00:45:37,076
And for you?

381
00:45:37,510 --> 00:45:40,279
Surprise me.

382
00:45:41,247 --> 00:45:42,281
Okay.

383
00:45:43,582 --> 00:45:47,051
I was 13 when my dad kicked it.
You know his last words to me?

384
00:45:47,053 --> 00:45:49,855
"Try to bang every waitress
who ever serves you."

385
00:45:55,529 --> 00:45:59,131
This Indian is
taking forever to show up.

386
00:46:03,936 --> 00:46:07,139
So, tell me
about this motel trick of yours.

387
00:46:07,574 --> 00:46:08,874
Twenty bucks.

388
00:46:11,311 --> 00:46:13,213
It's not a trick, all right.

389
00:46:14,815 --> 00:46:17,382
It's a beautiful invention. It's an invention
Steve Jobs would have been proud of.

390
00:46:17,384 --> 00:46:19,217
- Steve Jobs, huh?
- That's right.

391
00:46:19,219 --> 00:46:22,320
You know what made that guy
such a genius? Simplicity.

392
00:46:22,322 --> 00:46:24,091
- Let's hear it already.
- All right.

393
00:46:24,991 --> 00:46:28,226
I stay in motels
100 nights a year, right.

394
00:46:28,228 --> 00:46:32,163
First thing, every morning, I hang a
"clean the room" sign on the doorknob.

395
00:46:32,165 --> 00:46:34,366
Maid sees the sign,
she opens the door.

396
00:46:34,368 --> 00:46:37,035
Now, pay attention
to the details here.

397
00:46:37,037 --> 00:46:38,972
All the hard thought
behind them.

398
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:43,411
I'm lying on top of the covers,
stone naked.

399
00:46:44,412 --> 00:46:47,680
First crucial part,
I look into the maid's eyes, all right?

400
00:46:47,682 --> 00:46:52,153
If I don't, she backs right outta that
door. It's over before it even starts.

401
00:46:53,020 --> 00:46:56,455
I take the twenty,
I lay it right on my Jimmy.

402
00:46:56,457 --> 00:46:58,557
- Boom.
- Just a twenty?

403
00:46:58,559 --> 00:47:02,094
Maids make $8.35 an hour,
and they've got miserable lives too.

404
00:47:02,096 --> 00:47:04,130
That's the totally
underrated part of this.

405
00:47:04,132 --> 00:47:05,699
The ball is completely
in her court.

406
00:47:05,701 --> 00:47:07,734
She could back out of that door
no harm, no foul.

407
00:47:07,736 --> 00:47:11,003
Or... she could come and get it.

408
00:47:13,174 --> 00:47:16,276
- What's your success rate?
- Thirty-one percent.

409
00:47:16,278 --> 00:47:18,514
Hundred motels a year,
you do the math.

410
00:47:20,081 --> 00:47:23,083
He's got the same little
yellow gloves White Bull wears.

411
00:47:23,085 --> 00:47:25,252
- Is that an Indian thing?
- I guess.

412
00:47:31,160 --> 00:47:33,328
It's good.

413
00:47:34,129 --> 00:47:36,532
That's Steve fucking Jobs good.

414
00:47:37,332 --> 00:47:40,500
I see one flaw. Quality control.

415
00:47:40,502 --> 00:47:43,172
I'm paying her 20 bucks,
I'm not asking for Miss America.

416
00:47:43,706 --> 00:47:48,676
Still, there's no way there's 31 maids
in the whole country worth banging.

417
00:47:48,678 --> 00:47:50,647
You'd be surprised.

418
00:47:56,653 --> 00:47:58,455
Oh dear.

419
00:48:01,124 --> 00:48:03,391
Been at it all night,
haven't gotten a thing out of him.

420
00:48:06,162 --> 00:48:07,363
And you won't.

421
00:48:12,602 --> 00:48:13,671
You know, pain...

422
00:48:17,106 --> 00:48:19,340
it's like a religion
to these guys.

423
00:48:19,342 --> 00:48:22,276
You know, the Apaches used to consider
getting tortured a mark of honor.

424
00:48:22,278 --> 00:48:23,745
How's that for a value system?

425
00:48:23,747 --> 00:48:25,048
He's a Ute.

426
00:48:26,049 --> 00:48:29,351
- What now?
- Local Indians are Utes. Not Apache.

427
00:48:29,353 --> 00:48:32,223
You know I married an Indian.
Don't you think I know the difference?

428
00:49:23,141 --> 00:49:25,110
This doesn't happen
in Kehoe.

429
00:49:27,613 --> 00:49:29,214
It just did.

430
00:49:56,442 --> 00:49:58,210
It was his first run.

431
00:50:01,782 --> 00:50:04,483
"Just one run, Papa,"
he says to me.

432
00:50:07,588 --> 00:50:08,822
"I can do it."

433
00:50:11,425 --> 00:50:12,459
"I'm your son."

434
00:50:12,693 --> 00:50:14,226
What are we going to do?

435
00:50:30,878 --> 00:50:32,847
Okay, let's go home to Denver.

436
00:51:08,917 --> 00:51:10,418
Mr. Coxman.

437
00:51:22,564 --> 00:51:24,533
I'm very sorry for your loss.

438
00:51:27,936 --> 00:51:29,170
Thanks.

439
00:51:34,610 --> 00:51:35,644
Hey.

440
00:51:36,679 --> 00:51:37,713
So...

441
00:51:38,447 --> 00:51:39,848
- Here you go.
- Thanks.

442
00:51:41,250 --> 00:51:44,351
Ex-boyfriend of mine works Vice in Denver.
So I gave him a call today.

443
00:51:44,353 --> 00:51:47,487
Because you missed him and
wanted to see how he was doing.

444
00:51:47,489 --> 00:51:50,290
Well, he still thinks
there's a chance for us.

445
00:51:50,292 --> 00:51:51,326
What's his name?

446
00:51:52,796 --> 00:51:53,830
Kurt.

447
00:51:55,865 --> 00:51:59,602
- How long were you two lovers?
- Oh, Jesus. Two months, okay.

448
00:52:01,270 --> 00:52:07,644
I had him look up the forensics on our sign
hanger. The guy's name is Simon LeGrew.

449
00:52:07,877 --> 00:52:10,311
Now, his father is White Bull.

450
00:52:10,313 --> 00:52:12,847
He's a Native American
drug dealer from Denver

451
00:52:12,849 --> 00:52:15,650
who's been dealing coke
around here for 30 years.

452
00:52:15,652 --> 00:52:19,320
So now, White Bull
shares territory with Viking.

453
00:52:19,322 --> 00:52:23,293
He's a Denver drug dealer whose
real name is Trevor Calcote.

454
00:52:23,661 --> 00:52:24,695
So...

455
00:52:25,295 --> 00:52:26,762
I'm thinking...

456
00:52:26,764 --> 00:52:28,899
what we have here is a turf war.

457
00:52:29,834 --> 00:52:31,434
A drug turf war.

458
00:52:32,368 --> 00:52:33,771
Right here in Kehoe.

459
00:52:36,040 --> 00:52:37,808
So what are we gonna
do about it?

460
00:52:42,613 --> 00:52:48,317
Well, my 30 years' experience tells
me that this is a job for Denver Vice.

461
00:52:48,319 --> 00:52:52,755
It doesn't bother you that I just
learned more about a local drug lord

462
00:52:52,757 --> 00:52:55,792
in five minutes on the phone
than you've learned in 30 years?

463
00:52:55,794 --> 00:53:01,332
What bothers me is that Kurt's lying in bed
tonight convinced that he's back in your heart.

464
00:53:06,738 --> 00:53:08,372
Kurt's a big boy.

465
00:53:09,074 --> 00:53:10,876
I knew you'd be back.

466
00:53:13,378 --> 00:53:16,546
All right, Viking's real name
is Trevor Calcote.

467
00:53:16,548 --> 00:53:19,048
If you want him dead,
you're gonna have to hire a hit man.

468
00:53:19,050 --> 00:53:21,820
- A hit man?
- Yeah. An assassin.

469
00:53:23,522 --> 00:53:24,689
Do you know one?

470
00:53:25,490 --> 00:53:26,792
The Eskimo.

471
00:53:29,628 --> 00:53:31,463
So, how does this work?

472
00:53:31,764 --> 00:53:35,733
You buy The Eskimo a train ticket.
He's afraid to fly.

473
00:53:35,735 --> 00:53:39,069
You pick him up at the train
station, you drive him to a motel

474
00:53:39,071 --> 00:53:41,038
where you give him
half the money upfront.

475
00:53:41,040 --> 00:53:42,575
And then you go home.

476
00:53:43,943 --> 00:53:47,444
- How do I know when it's done?
- Keep checking <i>The Denver Post.</i>

477
00:53:47,446 --> 00:53:49,482
They can't resist
a good rub out.

478
00:53:50,716 --> 00:53:54,387
What is it with all these nicknames?
Speedo, Viking, Eskimo.

479
00:53:55,621 --> 00:53:58,123
The Eskimo.
It's a gangster thing.

480
00:53:58,125 --> 00:53:59,392
Did you have a nickname?

481
00:54:02,461 --> 00:54:04,597
Yeah. Wingman.

482
00:54:05,899 --> 00:54:06,967
Wingman?

483
00:54:08,168 --> 00:54:11,504
Yeah, from <i>Top Gun.</i>
As in "you can be my Wingman."

484
00:54:14,975 --> 00:54:16,076
Wingman.

485
00:54:35,829 --> 00:54:37,098
Come on.

486
00:54:41,702 --> 00:54:42,937
I tried, buddy.

487
00:55:38,160 --> 00:55:40,060
Some real music, please.

488
00:55:42,232 --> 00:55:45,201
- What do you want to hear?
- Anything else. Just no Kanye.

489
00:55:53,076 --> 00:55:54,677
Take it out of his tip.

490
00:56:06,823 --> 00:56:10,493
There's a convention in town.
This is all I could get.

491
00:56:31,182 --> 00:56:33,851
- This is only half.
- That's right.

492
00:56:36,187 --> 00:56:37,487
Are you a cop?

493
00:56:38,022 --> 00:56:38,956
No.

494
00:56:47,732 --> 00:56:51,100
The reason I ask is cops are
always a year behind the street.

495
00:56:51,102 --> 00:56:55,207
But the street knows it's two-thirds
upfront, one-third when the deal is done.

496
00:56:55,706 --> 00:56:58,943
But cops... they still think
it's half and half.

497
00:57:05,750 --> 00:57:08,086
Okay. We can do two-thirds.

498
00:57:16,695 --> 00:57:18,764
We're gonna get along
just fine.

499
00:57:20,699 --> 00:57:21,798
Yes!

500
00:57:21,800 --> 00:57:24,968
Yes! Ten grand! Ten grand, baby!

501
00:57:24,970 --> 00:57:25,971
Ten grand!

502
00:57:27,473 --> 00:57:31,843
That Jet touchdown just beat your Browns.
Whatever happened to loyalty?

503
00:57:35,647 --> 00:57:37,950
Sometimes loyalty
comes at a price.

504
00:57:39,318 --> 00:57:41,751
And besides,
my grandmother's from Brooklyn.

505
00:57:41,753 --> 00:57:43,923
So? Why don't you
give her a cut?

506
00:57:49,962 --> 00:57:50,863
Yeah?

507
00:57:52,165 --> 00:57:55,802
Says he's The Eskimo.
Says he has information you wanna buy.

508
00:57:56,736 --> 00:57:57,804
Let's hear him out.

509
00:58:04,010 --> 00:58:06,977
I've been offered
ninety grand to ice you.

510
00:58:06,979 --> 00:58:08,248
To ice me?

511
00:58:09,249 --> 00:58:12,785
You wanna ice a guy, you go to The Eskimo.
Well, that works for me.

512
00:58:13,719 --> 00:58:15,786
Who knew White Bull
had that kind of coin?

513
00:58:15,788 --> 00:58:18,924
White Bull's an Indian.
Indians don't farm out their kills.

514
00:58:18,926 --> 00:58:22,661
- So, if it wasn't White Bull, then who the hell was it?
- That's what I'm selling.

515
00:58:22,663 --> 00:58:25,666
- Well, how much?
- Ninety grand.

516
00:58:27,367 --> 00:58:29,367
You gotta love
the symmetry, there.

517
00:58:29,369 --> 00:58:32,204
You are one hell
of a businessman.

518
00:58:32,206 --> 00:58:33,341
I tries.

519
00:58:35,075 --> 00:58:37,778
Try. It's a singular.

520
00:58:39,713 --> 00:58:42,217
- Do we have a deal?
- 'Course we got a deal.

521
00:58:45,120 --> 00:58:47,954
Deposit the money into
this Cayman Islands account.

522
00:58:47,956 --> 00:58:50,423
When it hits, you get the name.

523
00:58:50,425 --> 00:58:51,658
Goody.

524
00:59:02,270 --> 00:59:04,403
I like working with pros.

525
00:59:04,405 --> 00:59:06,440
Cuts way down
on the bullshit factor.

526
00:59:06,442 --> 00:59:08,309
Yeah. So...

527
00:59:11,112 --> 00:59:13,012
who wants me dead?

528
00:59:13,014 --> 00:59:14,816
Guy's name is Coxman.

529
00:59:15,817 --> 00:59:16,918
Coxman.

530
00:59:17,819 --> 00:59:20,420
There was a Coxman
on Dad's payroll, right?

531
00:59:20,422 --> 00:59:24,326
What was his name? He called
himself, uh, Wing... Ding...

532
00:59:24,826 --> 00:59:26,393
Ringworm... Wing... Ding...

533
00:59:26,395 --> 00:59:28,228
- Wingman.
- Wingman!

534
00:59:28,230 --> 00:59:29,296
Wingman!

535
00:59:29,298 --> 00:59:32,334
Wingman wants me dead? Why?

536
00:59:32,902 --> 00:59:35,771
The why of it ain't my
business so I don't aks.

537
00:59:38,040 --> 00:59:40,508
- Ask.
- I think our business here is done.

538
00:59:40,510 --> 00:59:42,178
So it is.

539
00:59:42,811 --> 00:59:46,416
Hey, can I ask two questions?
If I may.

540
00:59:47,149 --> 00:59:48,817
One pro to another.

541
00:59:52,821 --> 00:59:53,789
Shoot.

542
00:59:57,893 --> 01:00:00,163
Why do they call you The Eskimo?

543
01:00:00,763 --> 01:00:03,131
Comes from the brothers
in the hood.

544
01:00:03,133 --> 01:00:07,137
Any nigga crazy enough to move up to snow
country has gotta be a fucking Eskimo.

545
01:00:10,540 --> 01:00:12,507
That's... you're funny.

546
01:00:12,509 --> 01:00:15,745
- Second question.
- All right, it's...

547
01:00:18,081 --> 01:00:20,315
Who taught you your ethics?

548
01:00:20,317 --> 01:00:22,384
Come again?

549
01:00:22,386 --> 01:00:26,756
You made a deal to kill me for 90
grand and you didn't honor that deal.

550
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,361
It's because
I'm honoring this one.

551
01:00:33,464 --> 01:00:34,465
Yeah.

552
01:00:36,267 --> 01:00:40,471
Guess a man's word doesn't
matter in the hood, right?

553
01:00:41,505 --> 01:00:45,107
Guess it's just every man
for himself in there.

554
01:00:45,109 --> 01:00:48,143
You see, out here,
character counts.

555
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:51,148
Without character there can be
no business and...

556
01:00:51,415 --> 01:00:53,317
without business...

557
01:00:54,352 --> 01:00:55,387
well...

558
01:00:57,255 --> 01:00:59,291
what the hell
would we do all day?

559
01:01:16,908 --> 01:01:18,910
Would you mind
stepping off the rug?

560
01:01:31,990 --> 01:01:34,057
Is this what you call
an Eskimo Roll?

561
01:01:45,238 --> 01:01:47,573
I'm thinking Ireland.

562
01:01:49,042 --> 01:01:50,376
Maybe Germany.

563
01:01:51,244 --> 01:01:52,512
Yeah? For what?

564
01:01:53,913 --> 01:01:56,516
- My ten grand vacation.
- Oh.

565
01:01:58,051 --> 01:02:01,220
Yeah, well,
Guinness over Becks any day.

566
01:02:07,594 --> 01:02:09,296
Then Dublin it is.

567
01:02:11,197 --> 01:02:13,032
You're gonna take me to Dublin?

568
01:02:13,534 --> 01:02:14,568
Yeah.

569
01:02:17,571 --> 01:02:18,605
Hey.

570
01:02:24,511 --> 01:02:26,547
Mustang, if we get caught out.

571
01:03:28,244 --> 01:03:29,245
Wingman.

572
01:03:30,011 --> 01:03:31,247
How the hell you been?

573
01:03:38,587 --> 01:03:40,923
We'd like you to come
for a little ride.

574
01:04:01,278 --> 01:04:04,980
Okay, Wingman,
tell me about The Eskimo.

575
01:04:05,248 --> 01:04:08,249
I guess you just don't get
what you pay for anymore.

576
01:04:08,251 --> 01:04:10,454
- Some of us do.
- Oh yeah?

577
01:04:10,787 --> 01:04:14,155
Well, what about Speedo
and Limbo and Santa?

578
01:04:14,157 --> 01:04:16,391
How did those guys
work out for you, huh?

579
01:04:16,393 --> 01:04:21,463
Okay. Now before you die, you're
gonna tell me what this is all about.

580
01:04:21,465 --> 01:04:24,667
The only question is,
how much pain do you wanna endure?

581
01:04:24,669 --> 01:04:29,707
I got cancer of the ass, dickweed.
So screw you, and screw your pain.

582
01:04:30,273 --> 01:04:32,275
You wanna know
what this is all about?

583
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:35,244
- It's about Bullitt.
- My father?

584
01:04:35,246 --> 01:04:37,580
Lying piece of shit
stole my woman.

585
01:04:37,582 --> 01:04:39,648
Dad banged anything
with a hole.

586
01:04:39,650 --> 01:04:42,351
Hey Bone, what is it
you used to say about him?

587
01:04:42,353 --> 01:04:44,620
He'd bang a rattlesnake
if someone held its head.

588
01:04:44,622 --> 01:04:46,624
- No offense.
- No, none taken.

589
01:04:47,124 --> 01:04:50,659
- Dad had thousands of women.
- Yeah, well, one of them was mine.

590
01:04:50,661 --> 01:04:55,431
- What's that got to do with me?
- His rancid blood runs through your veins.

591
01:04:55,433 --> 01:05:00,539
And that stupid grin of his is
plastered all over your arrogant face.

592
01:05:03,542 --> 01:05:05,142
Where's my cocaine?

593
01:05:07,813 --> 01:05:09,681
I flushed it down the toilet.

594
01:05:10,249 --> 01:05:12,618
- That was ten kilos.
- At least.

595
01:05:13,252 --> 01:05:15,519
Honestly, I thought it was more.

596
01:05:15,521 --> 01:05:18,123
So, you kill my men,

597
01:05:19,324 --> 01:05:23,095
you steal my coke,
over a goddamn woman?

598
01:05:23,695 --> 01:05:27,666
It's called love, sweetheart.
You should try it sometime.

599
01:05:28,735 --> 01:05:30,670
Now, are we done?

600
01:05:31,403 --> 01:05:34,206
Or do you want
to keep on chatting, skippy?

601
01:05:35,440 --> 01:05:36,408
Nah.

602
01:05:38,210 --> 01:05:39,646
Okay, Wingman.

603
01:05:41,681 --> 01:05:43,881
See, that's
how you do it, fellas.

604
01:05:43,883 --> 01:05:46,284
That's how you go out strong.

605
01:06:22,323 --> 01:06:23,591
Kehoe Precinct.

606
01:06:24,391 --> 01:06:26,291
- Yeah, just a sec. Kim.
- Yeah?

607
01:06:26,293 --> 01:06:28,195
Denver Vice.

608
01:06:30,831 --> 01:06:32,333
Kurt, hi.

609
01:06:34,201 --> 01:06:38,236
<i>So, that deep dive into Viking
and White Bull that you asked for...</i>

610
01:06:38,238 --> 01:06:39,739
<i>I got all the files here.</i>

611
01:06:39,741 --> 01:06:41,640
You're the best.

612
01:06:41,642 --> 01:06:42,809
<i>Wasn't easy.</i>

613
01:06:42,811 --> 01:06:45,279
Thank you.
Can you email them over?

614
01:06:45,512 --> 01:06:49,414
<i>I could. Or I could drive them up and
put them right into your warm hands.</i>

615
01:06:49,416 --> 01:06:53,318
<i>'Course, it's a three-hour drive,
so I need a place to stay the night.</i>

616
01:06:53,320 --> 01:06:57,857
Well, there's always my place.
But, here's the thing.

617
01:06:57,859 --> 01:07:01,596
I really need to spend
all night with those files.

618
01:07:02,597 --> 01:07:04,931
Now, if you were to shoot them
right over to me,

619
01:07:04,933 --> 01:07:07,500
I could probably be done
with them by tonight.

620
01:07:07,502 --> 01:07:12,340
And then I could put all my pent
up energy into something else.

621
01:07:12,607 --> 01:07:17,678
<i>Hmm. Okay, well, you got them, baby. Bang.</i>

622
01:07:17,680 --> 01:07:19,147
<i>Right in your inbox.</i>

623
01:07:19,649 --> 01:07:20,848
Oh, they're right in there.

624
01:07:20,850 --> 01:07:23,584
<i>So, how do we wanna do this?</i>

625
01:07:23,586 --> 01:07:26,587
<i>I'm thinking you leave the
door open and your lights off.</i>

626
01:07:26,589 --> 01:07:28,555
<i>Trust me to find...</i>

627
01:07:29,725 --> 01:07:31,892
Hold on a second. What was that?

628
01:07:31,894 --> 01:07:34,461
- <i>I said...</i>
- Oh God, we got an avalanche.

629
01:07:34,463 --> 01:07:35,898
I gotta call you back.

630
01:07:42,371 --> 01:07:43,873
Oh, hey, Gip?

631
01:07:45,008 --> 01:07:45,909
Yes!

632
01:07:58,789 --> 01:08:00,957
<i>Do I look like
a homeless guy to you?</i>

633
01:08:03,527 --> 01:08:04,928
<i>Thirty years ago...</i>

634
01:08:06,463 --> 01:08:10,434
<i>I lived in a hole in the ground below
the house of the guy that dealt me drugs.</i>

635
01:08:11,601 --> 01:08:16,239
<i>One day, he came to me,
stuck out his hand.</i>

636
01:08:19,476 --> 01:08:20,577
<i>I took it.</i>

637
01:08:22,479 --> 01:08:23,848
<i>And we made a deal.</i>

638
01:08:26,483 --> 01:08:27,785
<i>It was a good deal.</i>

639
01:08:30,021 --> 01:08:31,421
<i>Not a great deal.</i>

640
01:08:34,025 --> 01:08:36,661
<i>I should have bought a casino
like my brother.</i>

641
01:08:40,598 --> 01:08:41,966
<i>But a deal is a deal.</i>

642
01:08:43,501 --> 01:08:44,635
<i>And I honored it.</i>

643
01:08:46,738 --> 01:08:47,772
That honor...

644
01:08:48,873 --> 01:08:50,742
was repaid with butchery.

645
01:08:53,411 --> 01:08:54,946
They took my only son.

646
01:08:58,716 --> 01:08:59,817
Today...

647
01:09:01,586 --> 01:09:04,288
my boy will make
his final journey home.

648
01:09:06,825 --> 01:09:07,993
We will stay.

649
01:09:09,728 --> 01:09:10,896
Take our revenge.

650
01:09:12,698 --> 01:09:15,000
I will have blood for blood.

651
01:09:17,636 --> 01:09:19,004
A son for a son.

652
01:10:07,453 --> 01:10:08,155
Hi.

653
01:10:10,024 --> 01:10:12,057
- Goddamn it.
- You forgot.

654
01:10:12,059 --> 01:10:13,093
What?

655
01:10:13,994 --> 01:10:16,394
- What?
- The bullying seminar.

656
01:10:16,396 --> 01:10:18,831
Oh, God.

657
01:10:18,833 --> 01:10:20,734
- Every other parent was there.
- You're right, I forgot about the bullying seminar.

658
01:10:21,101 --> 01:10:22,968
But I'm allowed to forget,
you know why?

659
01:10:22,970 --> 01:10:25,504
Because I wrote a check
for a new computer center.

660
01:10:25,506 --> 01:10:29,410
You write a check, you get to skip on
150 bullying seminars. That's the math.

661
01:10:29,977 --> 01:10:32,413
That's one of the perks
of my business.

662
01:10:32,813 --> 01:10:35,716
You're not a businessman,
Trevor. You're a criminal.

663
01:10:37,852 --> 01:10:41,420
My powder's not good enough for you anymore?
I remember when it was plenty good enough.

664
01:10:41,422 --> 01:10:43,091
When you used
to roll around in it.

665
01:10:46,627 --> 01:10:47,661
Ah.

666
01:10:48,762 --> 01:10:52,968
See, I remember when just
a little bit of my powder...

667
01:10:55,804 --> 01:10:58,506
made you buck like a bronco.

668
01:11:00,609 --> 01:11:01,676
Goddamn.

669
01:11:03,778 --> 01:11:07,048
Close those beautiful
brown eyes of yours.

670
01:11:11,953 --> 01:11:15,423
See if it all
comes back to you.

671
01:11:15,624 --> 01:11:19,161
They needed a host for next week's
fundraiser. I signed you up.

672
01:12:33,603 --> 01:12:35,770
Here.

673
01:12:35,772 --> 01:12:37,674
Three of Viking's drug dealers
have disappeared in the last week.

674
01:12:38,776 --> 01:12:40,510
Tell me who Viking is again?

675
01:12:41,679 --> 01:12:44,582
The Denver drug lord.
White Bull's rival.

676
01:12:46,084 --> 01:12:47,685
Let me ask you a question.

677
01:12:48,252 --> 01:12:51,754
What is it you think we might
do to Viking or to White Bull?

678
01:12:51,756 --> 01:12:54,125
Take them out. Save our town.

679
01:12:58,029 --> 01:13:00,165
We got a little problem
to solve.

680
01:13:00,798 --> 01:13:01,899
We...

681
01:13:02,900 --> 01:13:04,900
we hung an innocent Indian
from a road sign.

682
01:13:04,902 --> 01:13:07,139
And my guess is White Bull's
not gonna like that.

683
01:13:07,605 --> 01:13:11,842
So, has anyone got any ideas on
how we might set things right?

684
01:13:11,844 --> 01:13:14,213
Yeah, maybe we should apologize.

685
01:13:14,847 --> 01:13:16,815
Yeah?

686
01:13:17,082 --> 01:13:20,784
One little screw up shouldn't make us their
bitches. So we send them a short note.

687
01:13:20,786 --> 01:13:23,954
Hey, and what does
this, uh, short note say?

688
01:13:23,956 --> 01:13:28,291
I don't know. How about,
"Sorry about Tonto, won't happen again"?

689
01:13:30,963 --> 01:13:32,831
No.

690
01:13:34,467 --> 01:13:37,569
I'm thinking we need something with a
bit more oomph. Something from our heart.

691
01:13:55,055 --> 01:13:57,955
Yeah, cut off his head.
Stick it in a box and send it to them.

692
01:13:57,957 --> 01:13:59,924
Tell them he's the culprit.

693
01:13:59,926 --> 01:14:03,897
Tell them our old arrangement's
back in effect and good to go.

694
01:14:16,810 --> 01:14:19,178
Get that shit away from me, man.

695
01:14:19,180 --> 01:14:20,814
What the hell's wrong with you?

696
01:14:22,183 --> 01:14:26,285
We've got some of the best pot
stores in the world, man. All legal.

697
01:14:26,287 --> 01:14:30,124
But no, instead you choose to
smoke that dang reservation weed.

698
01:14:31,258 --> 01:14:32,860
Maybe I like it better.

699
01:14:36,931 --> 01:14:39,133
- White people, man.
- Yeah.

700
01:14:41,802 --> 01:14:44,372
You know I had a rat
that was bigger than that thing.

701
01:14:49,211 --> 01:14:52,114
You should try smoking
that shit instead.

702
01:14:52,746 --> 01:14:53,848
That's gross.

703
01:14:57,785 --> 01:14:58,954
Mom!

704
01:15:01,223 --> 01:15:05,393
She gets him this week,
father gets him next week.

705
01:15:08,029 --> 01:15:10,332
Can you imagine
sharing your own son?

706
01:15:11,867 --> 01:15:12,901
Damn.

707
01:15:15,837 --> 01:15:17,939
- Kehoe.
- <i>Hey, it's Kurt.</i>

708
01:15:19,275 --> 01:15:21,342
Hi, Kurt.

709
01:15:21,344 --> 01:15:23,346
<i>You don't deserve this intel.</i>

710
01:15:25,281 --> 01:15:28,184
- Intel?
- <i>First tell me you don't deserve it.</i>

711
01:15:28,884 --> 01:15:30,752
I don't deserve it.
What you got?

712
01:15:32,421 --> 01:15:35,990
<i>A body. Dante Ferstel. Kehoe kid.
Found dead in a Denver alley.</i>

713
01:15:35,992 --> 01:15:38,259
<i>Smack overdose.
So, what's new, right?</i>

714
01:15:38,261 --> 01:15:40,794
<i>Just another
Saturday night sleeper.</i>

715
01:15:40,796 --> 01:15:44,233
<i>And here's the kicker.
Dante was a baggage monkey at the airport.</i>

716
01:15:45,768 --> 01:15:47,236
The Kehoe airport?

717
01:15:56,513 --> 01:15:57,880
Mr. Coxman.

718
01:15:58,948 --> 01:16:00,450
What can I do for you?

719
01:16:02,885 --> 01:16:03,920
It's about your son.

720
01:16:10,327 --> 01:16:14,464
- I didn't know if you'd heard about Dante Ferstel.
- Yeah. He died of an overdose.

721
01:16:18,168 --> 01:16:21,805
Dante worked with your son
at the airport, right?

722
01:16:24,141 --> 01:16:26,076
- Yeah.
- Did you know him?

723
01:16:26,977 --> 01:16:27,945
No.

724
01:16:28,178 --> 01:16:29,880
Kyle never mention him to you?

725
01:16:31,048 --> 01:16:32,217
No.

726
01:16:39,190 --> 01:16:40,325
Is that it?

727
01:16:41,526 --> 01:16:43,127
I guess it is.

728
01:16:49,000 --> 01:16:51,402
I don't understand
why you're here.

729
01:16:52,136 --> 01:16:53,238
Truth?

730
01:16:54,439 --> 01:16:56,307
I don't think
your son was a junkie.

731
01:16:59,377 --> 01:17:02,146
And I don't think
Dante Ferstel was either.

732
01:17:03,582 --> 01:17:06,150
So, what do you think
happened to them?

733
01:17:06,851 --> 01:17:07,952
I don't know.

734
01:17:09,355 --> 01:17:12,991
I was hoping you might be able to
tell me something that could help.

735
01:17:17,329 --> 01:17:18,330
Sorry...

736
01:17:19,865 --> 01:17:21,133
I can't help you.

737
01:17:21,834 --> 01:17:24,970
You can't help me.
I got work to do.

738
01:17:27,940 --> 01:17:29,108
I understand.

739
01:17:30,442 --> 01:17:31,544
Tape.

740
01:17:32,444 --> 01:17:33,480
Taser.

741
01:17:34,280 --> 01:17:35,515
Antibiotics.

742
01:17:36,181 --> 01:17:37,417
Antibiotics?

743
01:17:38,017 --> 01:17:39,918
Yeah, you ever been bitten
by a kid?

744
01:17:41,854 --> 01:17:45,292
Little bastards are nasty.
You almost wish you were bitten by a dog.

745
01:17:49,296 --> 01:17:50,330
Yes?

746
01:17:52,565 --> 01:17:53,566
Okay.

747
01:17:57,504 --> 01:17:59,005
We can't grab him yet.

748
01:17:59,439 --> 01:18:03,009
- Why not?
- They're sending a messenger.

749
01:18:12,453 --> 01:18:14,220
I am the messenger.

750
01:18:26,033 --> 01:18:28,002
Thank you for seeing me.

751
01:18:34,942 --> 01:18:39,246
He's been punished for his deed.
We want peace with you again.

752
01:18:39,681 --> 01:18:41,048
Okay.

753
01:18:43,250 --> 01:18:45,152
I appreciate the gift.

754
01:18:46,253 --> 01:18:47,855
It was thoughtful.

755
01:18:54,329 --> 01:18:57,165
You showed a lot of guts
coming here alone.

756
01:19:02,104 --> 01:19:04,373
But I need a son for a son.

757
01:19:41,210 --> 01:19:43,312
Careful, man!
You might hit a kid.

758
01:19:48,985 --> 01:19:50,719
If you do it again,
I'll kill you.

759
01:19:50,721 --> 01:19:52,054
Yes?

760
01:19:52,989 --> 01:19:55,191
- See you guys tomorrow.
- Hey, Ryan.

761
01:19:55,592 --> 01:19:58,161
Um, I'm taking you home today.

762
01:19:59,295 --> 01:20:01,663
But this is my mom's week
to pick me up.

763
01:20:01,665 --> 01:20:05,335
Yeah, I know, but she got stuck at the
dentist. Asked me to come and get you.

764
01:20:05,769 --> 01:20:06,936
What?

765
01:20:08,004 --> 01:20:09,071
We take him.

766
01:20:10,140 --> 01:20:13,041
- What about the messenger?
- We shot the messenger.

767
01:20:13,043 --> 01:20:15,744
I don't remember her telling me
about a trip to the dentist.

768
01:20:15,746 --> 01:20:19,450
Yeah, she had a root canal
develop some problems.

769
01:20:21,051 --> 01:20:24,955
And your dad said could I pick you up.
So, here I am.

770
01:20:25,389 --> 01:20:28,525
- This is us here.
- What happened to the Tesla?

771
01:20:33,430 --> 01:20:34,364
Shit!

772
01:21:04,195 --> 01:21:05,729
Seatbelt.

773
01:21:05,731 --> 01:21:08,199
- Where's the kid?
- He got away in a van.

774
01:21:09,133 --> 01:21:10,469
What kind of a van?

775
01:21:11,403 --> 01:21:12,738
Said "Kehoe" on it.

776
01:21:14,072 --> 01:21:17,106
We'll find the kid. We'll find the van.
It won't take us long.

777
01:21:17,108 --> 01:21:20,210
Get rid of these two
before they start to stink.

778
01:21:32,826 --> 01:21:34,493
Answer the phone.

779
01:21:43,135 --> 01:21:44,169
Hello?

780
01:21:46,873 --> 01:21:49,776
No, he can't talk right now.

781
01:21:51,811 --> 01:21:53,213
Because he's dead.

782
01:21:55,782 --> 01:21:58,416
Let's go. Three cars.

783
01:21:58,418 --> 01:21:59,819
What about the body?

784
01:22:03,723 --> 01:22:06,192
Minya, take care of this.

785
01:22:06,726 --> 01:22:09,797
I'm busy.
Let the fucking Indian do it.

786
01:22:23,310 --> 01:22:25,580
You don't work for my father,
do you?

787
01:22:30,451 --> 01:22:32,553
Who were those guys anyways?

788
01:22:32,920 --> 01:22:34,388
I don't know.

789
01:22:37,758 --> 01:22:39,560
You don't have to worry
about them.

790
01:22:40,428 --> 01:22:41,329
Right.

791
01:22:45,666 --> 01:22:47,803
They can't take my son
and not call.

792
01:22:48,770 --> 01:22:50,538
That's not how it's done.

793
01:22:52,708 --> 01:22:54,743
Those tepee asswipes.

794
01:22:56,578 --> 01:22:58,212
Those goddamn alkies.

795
01:23:00,582 --> 01:23:04,886
I'm gonna take one of them, I'm gonna hang
them from every road sign from here to Utah.

796
01:23:05,887 --> 01:23:09,291
You take a man's son, you call!
Everybody knows that!

797
01:23:13,295 --> 01:23:14,863
I mean, they took my boy.

798
01:23:15,864 --> 01:23:17,797
My little boy.

799
01:23:17,799 --> 01:23:20,300
Are you insane!
This is my week.

800
01:23:20,302 --> 01:23:25,572
You pick him up without asking? Are you
so damn stupid you'd kidnap your own son?

801
01:23:25,574 --> 01:23:30,212
I can't wait to watch my lawyer write
up the new arrangement. Full custody.

802
01:23:31,547 --> 01:23:35,215
You'll be lucky to get him two
hours a month. Two supervised hours.

803
01:23:35,217 --> 01:23:37,217
A cop in the room with you,
watching you play.

804
01:23:37,219 --> 01:23:39,587
You won't get him alone until
he graduates from high school.

805
01:23:39,589 --> 01:23:43,393
A public high school! With normal kids.
And no stupid diets!

806
01:23:47,397 --> 01:23:50,667
I guess you won't be doing that again.

807
01:23:51,434 --> 01:23:54,203
Right? Uh-huh.

808
01:23:58,008 --> 01:23:59,542
He's not here.

809
01:24:01,310 --> 01:24:03,244
- What?
- Ah...

810
01:24:19,296 --> 01:24:20,731
Turn that song off.

811
01:24:27,271 --> 01:24:30,507
It's a text.
From a different number.

812
01:24:31,876 --> 01:24:35,646
"Sequoia Motel. Room twelve."

813
01:24:35,914 --> 01:24:37,916
"Steve Jobs, baby."

814
01:24:55,533 --> 01:24:56,568
Hello.

815
01:25:02,340 --> 01:25:04,242
A little peepee tepee.

816
01:25:36,375 --> 01:25:37,877
Oh, shit.

817
01:25:49,790 --> 01:25:54,358
I know how this world works. They call with
their demands. I give them what they want.

818
01:25:54,360 --> 01:25:55,595
We get Ryan back.

819
01:25:58,031 --> 01:26:01,900
In 24 hours, I call the police.

820
01:26:01,902 --> 01:26:04,404
In 24 hours, he'll be home.

821
01:26:04,805 --> 01:26:07,007
- You'll burn in hell for this.
- Yeah.

822
01:26:07,607 --> 01:26:08,875
I'll see you there.

823
01:26:58,459 --> 01:27:00,760
Welcome to Kehoe Chateau Montclair.

824
01:27:00,762 --> 01:27:04,698
- We need rooms tonight.
- I'm sorry, you need a reservation.

825
01:27:04,700 --> 01:27:05,834
Excuse me.

826
01:27:06,602 --> 01:27:07,803
A reservation.

827
01:27:09,071 --> 01:27:10,138
Really?

828
01:27:12,174 --> 01:27:16,810
A reser... Oh! No,
I didn't mean it like that.

829
01:27:16,812 --> 01:27:19,946
I meant you need to reserve...
book before you get here

830
01:27:19,948 --> 01:27:22,116
because we're all full.
That's all I meant.

831
01:27:22,118 --> 01:27:24,551
You know what I heard?

832
01:27:24,553 --> 01:27:28,155
You told me and my friends that we
need to go back to the reservation.

833
01:27:28,157 --> 01:27:29,458
Oh, no.

834
01:27:30,459 --> 01:27:33,863
Do you have any idea
what I can do to you...

835
01:27:34,697 --> 01:27:35,564
on Yelp?

836
01:27:37,967 --> 01:27:40,467
You might wanna get
your boss out here.

837
01:27:40,469 --> 01:27:43,039
Or you could take another look.

838
01:27:44,774 --> 01:27:46,643
I will take another look.

839
01:27:59,489 --> 01:28:01,524
- You hungry?
- Sure.

840
01:28:06,130 --> 01:28:07,229
Eggs?

841
01:28:07,231 --> 01:28:08,464
Okay.

842
01:28:15,572 --> 01:28:17,808
- You live here?
- Yeah.

843
01:28:21,612 --> 01:28:22,680
All alone?

844
01:28:24,148 --> 01:28:25,115
Yeah.

845
01:28:27,651 --> 01:28:28,953
You don't have any kids?

846
01:28:31,522 --> 01:28:32,556
No.

847
01:28:50,909 --> 01:28:51,977
You like rock?

848
01:28:53,078 --> 01:28:54,612
I like classical.

849
01:29:12,597 --> 01:29:16,035
It wasn't very smart
bringing me to your house.

850
01:29:18,037 --> 01:29:19,071
Why?

851
01:29:24,677 --> 01:29:26,145
I want to talk to your dad.

852
01:29:27,079 --> 01:29:28,114
Tonight?

853
01:29:28,981 --> 01:29:30,149
In the morning.

854
01:29:39,326 --> 01:29:42,195
They're a bit greasy.

855
01:29:52,172 --> 01:29:54,808
You said you didn't
have any kids.

856
01:29:55,175 --> 01:29:56,910
He went away.

857
01:29:57,677 --> 01:29:59,046
Go on, get in bed.

858
01:30:03,984 --> 01:30:05,752
Where are you gonna sleep?

859
01:30:06,186 --> 01:30:08,853
In my room, down the hall.

860
01:30:08,855 --> 01:30:12,157
- What if I run away?
- There's nowhere for you to go, kid.

861
01:30:12,159 --> 01:30:14,793
You'd freeze to death
out there. Goodnight.

862
01:30:14,795 --> 01:30:17,296
I always get read
a story before bed.

863
01:30:17,298 --> 01:30:22,070
- I don't know any stories.
- You can read me anything. I don't care what it is.

864
01:30:25,907 --> 01:30:29,877
The new C-130 is the crème
de la crme of snow-pushers.

865
01:30:30,111 --> 01:30:34,113
Built to humble Mother Nature,
she has a rated load of three tons.

866
01:30:34,115 --> 01:30:39,351
The Overhausen UTV attachment snow
blowers are made for universal use,

867
01:30:39,353 --> 01:30:42,188
equipped with powerful
modern engines.

868
01:30:42,190 --> 01:30:44,959
They're extremely effective
and flexible.

869
01:30:45,226 --> 01:30:48,930
A capacity of four thousand
tons of snow per hour.

870
01:30:49,964 --> 01:30:52,234
Throwing distance
of a hundred feet.

871
01:30:54,103 --> 01:30:55,002
Yeah.

872
01:30:56,238 --> 01:30:58,706
She is a great machine,
all right.

873
01:30:59,041 --> 01:31:00,342
I've got one of these.

874
01:31:01,709 --> 01:31:03,678
I thought you were a kidnapper.

875
01:31:05,680 --> 01:31:06,915
Not all the time.

876
01:31:08,717 --> 01:31:11,320
Well, can I get a ride in it?

877
01:31:14,056 --> 01:31:15,691
You are going to sleep.

878
01:31:31,474 --> 01:31:35,011
Have you heard
of the Stockholm Syndrome?

879
01:32:23,194 --> 01:32:24,695
Morning, boss.

880
01:32:25,362 --> 01:32:26,463
Did you find him?

881
01:32:27,464 --> 01:32:30,232
Not yet. We will.

882
01:32:30,234 --> 01:32:32,435
Mr. White Bull.

883
01:32:32,437 --> 01:32:35,971
These are some complimentary ski passes.
Good for the whole weekend.

884
01:32:35,973 --> 01:32:38,541
For you and all of your...
friends.

885
01:32:38,543 --> 01:32:42,111
And I just wanna thank you again
for choosing to stay with us.

886
01:32:42,113 --> 01:32:45,283
We know that you do have
other entertainment options.

887
01:32:47,385 --> 01:32:48,353
Thank you.

888
01:32:50,088 --> 01:32:53,024
- Janitor from Ryan's school.
- Janitor, why not?

889
01:32:53,425 --> 01:32:56,728
It's an honor to be here.
You hear the whispers but...

890
01:32:58,096 --> 01:33:00,332
- You have something for me?
- I might.

891
01:33:02,133 --> 01:33:05,103
The van your boy got into.
I've seen it before.

892
01:33:06,104 --> 01:33:08,374
And the guy that was driving
that van, I've seen him too.

893
01:33:08,873 --> 01:33:12,476
Me and my family go up
to the resort in Kehoe.

894
01:33:12,478 --> 01:33:15,281
- You know, the fancy one? Chateau Montclair.
- Oh, yeah.

895
01:33:15,514 --> 01:33:19,350
Well, we're driving up and, you
know, she scoots over and she's...

896
01:33:19,352 --> 01:33:23,456
showing a little appreciation
on the way up, you get my drift?

897
01:33:24,123 --> 01:33:25,491
- I do.
- Yeah.

898
01:33:25,891 --> 01:33:28,158
You ever tried to keep the wheel
straight when someone's...

899
01:33:28,160 --> 01:33:29,161
The van.

900
01:33:33,734 --> 01:33:37,103
Well, like I was saying.
The van that stopped to help me...

901
01:33:38,871 --> 01:33:40,973
that's the same van
that your boy got into.

902
01:33:41,608 --> 01:33:44,277
And the guy who pulled me
out of the ditch that night...

903
01:33:45,312 --> 01:33:47,281
he's the same guy
that picked up your boy.

904
01:33:47,581 --> 01:33:50,116
He's got one of those names
that you never ever forget.

905
01:33:51,251 --> 01:33:52,219
Coxman.

906
01:33:54,087 --> 01:33:55,188
Coxman.

907
01:33:55,855 --> 01:33:59,224
Yeah. We laughed about it
all night long.

908
01:33:59,226 --> 01:34:02,029
- Because what she was doing...
- Oh my God.

909
01:34:02,963 --> 01:34:07,165
- Coxman had a relative.
- And he hasn't spoken with the cops.

910
01:34:07,167 --> 01:34:10,402
Well... how much
did my guy offer you?

911
01:34:10,404 --> 01:34:11,805
Ten grand.

912
01:34:12,472 --> 01:34:14,107
Ten grand it is.

913
01:35:08,297 --> 01:35:10,265
Hey! Hey, check him out.

914
01:35:10,933 --> 01:35:14,036
You're crazy, Avalanche!

915
01:35:15,938 --> 01:35:17,172
You sure you've
done this before?

916
01:35:18,140 --> 01:35:19,641
I was born to fly, white boy.

917
01:35:58,081 --> 01:36:01,482
I have your son.
If you wanna see him alive, come alone.

918
01:36:01,484 --> 01:36:03,219
Yeah, yeah.
I know how it's done.

919
01:36:04,187 --> 01:36:05,589
So, how much
do you want for him?

920
01:36:06,891 --> 01:36:11,928
We'll talk about that when you get here.
2210 Quarry Road. Kehoe.

921
01:36:12,496 --> 01:36:17,234
I'm just leaving Denver.
It's gonna take me about three hours.

922
01:36:47,532 --> 01:36:48,667
Jesus Christ.

923
01:36:56,374 --> 01:36:57,409
Son of a...

924
01:37:05,650 --> 01:37:08,688
- Hey.
- Hey. Taking a day off?

925
01:37:09,354 --> 01:37:12,224
- Main road could use a plow.
- I'll get to it soon.

926
01:37:14,827 --> 01:37:16,762
My nephew. Visiting.

927
01:37:17,563 --> 01:37:20,129
Must be a comfort
to have family in town.

928
01:37:20,131 --> 01:37:22,167
We saw all the cars
at your place.

929
01:37:25,705 --> 01:37:26,639
Yeah.

930
01:37:34,780 --> 01:37:35,748
Look at this.

931
01:37:37,583 --> 01:37:39,750
- So now we know he's banging a hippie.
- No.

932
01:37:39,752 --> 01:37:42,355
On the truck. The company name.

933
01:37:43,523 --> 01:37:46,492
- Open Road.
- It's four miles away.

934
01:37:47,661 --> 01:37:49,295
- Get the men.
- Let's go.

935
01:37:59,138 --> 01:38:02,342
- That was so much fun!
- I need you...

936
01:38:02,776 --> 01:38:04,211
to sit here...

937
01:38:05,145 --> 01:38:07,481
and wait till someone comes
to get you.

938
01:38:21,328 --> 01:38:23,798
- <i>They're headed to Open Road Garage.</i>
- Again. Say what?

939
01:38:25,733 --> 01:38:27,602
Open Road Garage.

940
01:38:29,804 --> 01:38:31,238
<i>On Old Bend Road.</i>

941
01:39:04,440 --> 01:39:05,374
Ryan!

942
01:39:05,708 --> 01:39:08,575
Come on. Inside. Come on, move.

943
01:39:08,577 --> 01:39:11,747
- Why do you have a rifle?
- Just do what I say. Up the stairs, move.

944
01:39:13,382 --> 01:39:14,583
Get in the cabinet.

945
01:39:17,686 --> 01:39:19,288
Why are you mad at me?

946
01:39:19,922 --> 01:39:22,191
I'm not mad at you. It's just...

947
01:39:22,825 --> 01:39:25,628
It's just really important
you do what I say.

948
01:39:27,262 --> 01:39:28,364
You're a good kid.

949
01:39:29,398 --> 01:39:31,668
- What?
- I said don't move.

950
01:41:16,075 --> 01:41:17,944
The last Coxman.

951
01:41:23,516 --> 01:41:26,251
Where is my son?

952
01:41:28,621 --> 01:41:32,490
My business can get very creative,
but I'm an old fashioned kind of guy.

953
01:41:32,492 --> 01:41:34,393
I like to keep things simple.

954
01:41:35,394 --> 01:41:39,964
So if I have to ask you again,
I'm gonna pull out your fingernails...

955
01:41:39,966 --> 01:41:43,503
cut off your fingers,
chop off your hands...

956
01:41:43,770 --> 01:41:45,772
and hack off your nose.

957
01:41:49,910 --> 01:41:51,777
Oh, and that part
about the nose,

958
01:41:51,779 --> 01:41:54,112
you are really not gonna
like that part.

959
01:41:54,114 --> 01:41:56,049
You don't deserve your son.

960
01:41:59,586 --> 01:42:00,721
Take him to the garage.

961
01:43:01,583 --> 01:43:02,985
Bastard!

962
01:47:01,197 --> 01:47:04,333
<i>Got a kid driving
a snow blower headed towards Kehoe.</i>

963
01:47:20,716 --> 01:47:22,618
Get a message...

964
01:47:23,185 --> 01:47:24,620
to Aya.

965
01:47:29,125 --> 01:47:30,726
Tell my wife...

966
01:47:34,164 --> 01:47:35,762
tell her she's a...

967
01:48:02,926 --> 01:48:04,294
What are you doing?

968
01:48:05,028 --> 01:48:06,029
My job.

969
