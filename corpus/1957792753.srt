1
00:00:47,119 --> 00:00:48,412
Help...

2
00:02:39,250 --> 00:02:46,175
PASSION IN THE DESERT

3
00:02:47,677 --> 00:02:53,601
1978. Napoleon's struggling army pursues
Mameluke warriors deep into the Egyptian desert

4
00:02:57,104 --> 00:02:58,648
Augustin!

5
00:03:03,236 --> 00:03:04,530
Venture!

6
00:03:06,199 --> 00:03:07,700
Courage, citizen.

7
00:03:08,075 --> 00:03:09,327
We're almost there!

8
00:03:15,167 --> 00:03:17,921
We'd be there even sooner
if you got on your horse.

9
00:03:29,434 --> 00:03:31,019
How much further is it?

10
00:03:31,561 --> 00:03:32,771
Just what I said to you.

11
00:03:32,979 --> 00:03:34,232
We made good time too.

12
00:03:39,655 --> 00:03:44,409
- Temle of Bastet.
- No. The real food and wine, Venture.

13
00:03:44,660 --> 00:03:46,371
Good French wine.

14
00:03:59,177 --> 00:04:00,679
Captain Augustin Robert.

15
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:03,975
- Artillery guide general Clever's division.
- Report, captain.

16
00:04:04,642 --> 00:04:07,061
I have orders from general Bonaparte

17
00:04:07,353 --> 00:04:10,232
to escort the artist,
citizen Venture de P...

18
00:04:11,525 --> 00:04:14,195
Where have you got to now,
you slippery old goat?

19
00:04:18,616 --> 00:04:20,619
We will accompany you as far as Tell Basta.

20
00:04:20,953 --> 00:04:21,996
Four days there...

21
00:04:22,496 --> 00:04:25,291
one day sketching, in about nine days
we should be back in Cairo.

22
00:04:25,374 --> 00:04:26,460
If you don't get lost.

23
00:04:26,543 --> 00:04:29,671
Well you can't get lost in Egypt.
There's the Nile and there is the see.

24
00:04:45,648 --> 00:04:46,648
And...

25
00:04:47,484 --> 00:04:49,111
The nose! Stop.

26
00:04:52,364 --> 00:04:54,158
The nose: seven.

27
00:04:54,283 --> 00:04:55,368
Seven.

28
00:04:56,828 --> 00:04:57,954
Down. Down.

29
00:04:58,205 --> 00:04:59,205
Left.

30
00:05:00,332 --> 00:05:01,332
Left.

31
00:05:02,251 --> 00:05:03,419
Left again!

32
00:05:04,879 --> 00:05:05,879
That's good.

33
00:05:06,255 --> 00:05:08,091
Here is...

34
00:05:09,301 --> 00:05:10,761
between eight and nine.

35
00:05:11,887 --> 00:05:12,887
Eight or nine?

36
00:05:13,014 --> 00:05:15,892
Forty centuries, you donkey!

37
00:05:16,351 --> 00:05:17,393
What are they doing?

38
00:05:20,731 --> 00:05:21,524
No!

39
00:05:21,607 --> 00:05:22,691
Vive la France!

40
00:05:22,900 --> 00:05:24,236
Venture, look out!

41
00:05:24,402 --> 00:05:25,402
No!

42
00:05:30,910 --> 00:05:32,912
What do they have against beauty?

43
00:05:33,162 --> 00:05:34,162
It's old.

44
00:05:37,167 --> 00:05:39,169
Built by slaves for aristocrats.

45
00:05:39,294 --> 00:05:41,506
Like yourself, citizen Venture.

46
00:05:58,024 --> 00:06:02,238
Bonaparte will have your hide
if anything happens to his precious artist.

47
00:06:02,280 --> 00:06:04,031
Nothing will happen to Venture.

48
00:06:04,407 --> 00:06:06,785
We have Allah on our side.

49
00:06:07,995 --> 00:06:12,375
Venture, dresses like our enemy.
He talks like our enemy.

50
00:06:12,500 --> 00:06:14,627
So should he not be with our enemy?

51
00:06:17,256 --> 00:06:19,049
Shall we tell stories...

52
00:06:19,383 --> 00:06:21,010
or sleep?

53
00:06:24,473 --> 00:06:25,557
May I sit down?

54
00:06:29,896 --> 00:06:30,896
What was that?

55
00:06:33,441 --> 00:06:34,860
Hyena.

56
00:06:37,237 --> 00:06:38,447
What is out there?

57
00:06:38,739 --> 00:06:39,866
Jinns.

58
00:06:40,408 --> 00:06:41,408
Jinns?

59
00:06:41,534 --> 00:06:45,998
Spirits that can inhabit in a rock,
a tree, an animal.

60
00:06:47,208 --> 00:06:50,711
Lizards, that blind you with a look.

61
00:06:51,505 --> 00:06:54,758
Chimera, giant birds...

62
00:06:56,384 --> 00:06:58,262
that outrun a horse.

63
00:06:59,347 --> 00:07:00,598
Snakes...

64
00:07:00,890 --> 00:07:02,433
Snakes that fly.

65
00:07:03,059 --> 00:07:05,354
Or Jinns can take a human shape.

66
00:07:05,854 --> 00:07:09,025
The only thing the fearless Bedouin fear.

67
00:07:09,150 --> 00:07:10,401
Birds that can outrun a horse.

68
00:07:10,610 --> 00:07:11,903
Snakes that fly.

69
00:07:12,529 --> 00:07:14,155
Lies and superstitions.

70
00:07:15,074 --> 00:07:16,617
Blinding the people.

71
00:07:17,618 --> 00:07:19,954
That's why we have to kill the priests.

72
00:07:22,207 --> 00:07:24,626
Lies. Superstitions.

73
00:07:24,668 --> 00:07:26,044
No! Taboos!

74
00:07:26,879 --> 00:07:30,550
Bad luck, like shooting that Sphinx!

75
00:08:10,346 --> 00:08:12,223
Ho! Attack!

76
00:08:12,682 --> 00:08:14,768
Attack! Attack!

77
00:08:14,894 --> 00:08:17,188
- Alert! Alert...!
- Attack...!

78
00:08:18,982 --> 00:08:20,609
Wake up! Get up!

79
00:08:20,859 --> 00:08:21,943
Get up! Move!

80
00:08:37,879 --> 00:08:39,255
Wheel it around! Wheel it around!

81
00:08:40,465 --> 00:08:42,133
Wait for me!

82
00:08:47,097 --> 00:08:48,642
Come on! Form the line!

83
00:08:48,892 --> 00:08:49,892
Fire!

84
00:08:57,443 --> 00:08:58,443
Fire!

85
00:09:13,963 --> 00:09:15,005
Get down!

86
00:09:42,163 --> 00:09:43,289
Venture!

87
00:10:58,460 --> 00:10:59,460
What are you doing?

88
00:11:00,003 --> 00:11:01,004
I want my shot back.

89
00:11:02,632 --> 00:11:03,632
No!

90
00:11:05,760 --> 00:11:06,886
He's not dead.

91
00:11:24,198 --> 00:11:25,409
Venture!

92
00:11:51,189 --> 00:11:52,315
Haven't you got it yet?

93
00:11:53,399 --> 00:11:55,652
You soldiers are always in a hurry.

94
00:11:56,695 --> 00:11:58,363
You only arrive at a place,

95
00:11:58,530 --> 00:12:00,533
when you start out for the next one.

96
00:12:01,784 --> 00:12:02,785
Look.

97
00:12:06,916 --> 00:12:07,916
Beautiful.

98
00:12:09,877 --> 00:12:11,712
You think we don't need those soldiers?

99
00:12:15,592 --> 00:12:18,054
Bedouin will be behind us like jackals.

100
00:13:00,603 --> 00:13:03,898
Bedouins say it's good luck
to start a journey

101
00:13:04,023 --> 00:13:05,442
in a sandstorm!

102
00:13:05,568 --> 00:13:07,194
I'm glad to hear it!

103
00:13:24,339 --> 00:13:26,008
Can you see anything?

104
00:13:26,383 --> 00:13:27,426
Tracks are gone.

105
00:13:29,387 --> 00:13:30,638
The wind.

106
00:13:31,097 --> 00:13:32,223
It's Simoom.

107
00:13:32,974 --> 00:13:34,393
Breath of the desert.

108
00:13:35,102 --> 00:13:36,437
Might blow for a day...

109
00:13:38,063 --> 00:13:39,064
Or six.

110
00:13:39,858 --> 00:13:41,776
Totally unpredictable.

111
00:13:41,860 --> 00:13:44,821
Like living in the tempest
of a woman's heart.

112
00:13:49,952 --> 00:13:53,040
Imagine, fifty days of it.

113
00:14:25,327 --> 00:14:26,538
Augustin!

114
00:14:32,211 --> 00:14:35,673
- It says fertile land...
- Open. Close.

115
00:14:36,715 --> 00:14:39,177
...and sweet water of Beni Suef.

116
00:14:41,388 --> 00:14:42,556
We're not lost!

117
00:14:42,722 --> 00:14:43,722
No!

118
00:14:43,808 --> 00:14:45,017
We're not lost.

119
00:14:49,815 --> 00:14:51,525
We are...

120
00:14:51,900 --> 00:14:53,026
...here!

121
00:14:53,402 --> 00:14:55,863
We simply misplaced the French army.

122
00:14:56,114 --> 00:14:57,699
Forty thousand men...

123
00:14:57,991 --> 00:14:59,271
...mesh ma'ool.
["unbelievable"].

124
00:15:26,941 --> 00:15:28,109
Don't move.

125
00:15:28,735 --> 00:15:29,735
Don't move.

126
00:15:30,738 --> 00:15:31,739
Don't move.

127
00:15:40,916 --> 00:15:42,043
What are you doing?

128
00:15:42,209 --> 00:15:44,503
We could have eaten it!
Why didn't you catch it?

129
00:17:00,467 --> 00:17:03,220
A man can go for three days without water.

130
00:17:08,435 --> 00:17:10,563
Have you even had an apricot ice?

131
00:17:12,356 --> 00:17:13,356
Go on!

132
00:17:15,569 --> 00:17:18,238
In the shape of the ripe, round apricot

133
00:17:18,530 --> 00:17:22,410
with frost, that that forms
on the outside of the glass.

134
00:17:22,535 --> 00:17:24,495
Oh, beautiful, beautiful frost.

135
00:17:25,163 --> 00:17:28,918
Take a little slice between your
tongue and your palate, and...

136
00:17:29,084 --> 00:17:30,169
it melts.

137
00:17:30,377 --> 00:17:32,171
Coolly, deliciously...

138
00:17:37,677 --> 00:17:40,556
The last of our water to mix your paints!

139
00:18:08,339 --> 00:18:09,465
We are lost.

140
00:18:10,216 --> 00:18:11,968
We've been here before.

141
00:18:21,062 --> 00:18:22,981
Look, we...

142
00:18:40,751 --> 00:18:42,295
I have never been here before.

143
00:18:47,009 --> 00:18:48,595
I've never been here before.

144
00:18:50,888 --> 00:18:52,015
I've never been...

145
00:18:52,724 --> 00:18:53,724
here...

146
00:18:53,891 --> 00:18:54,891
before.

147
00:18:56,103 --> 00:18:57,103
I've never...

148
00:18:58,522 --> 00:18:59,522
been here...

149
00:18:59,857 --> 00:19:00,942
before.

150
00:19:13,415 --> 00:19:16,543
You can't get lost in Egypt.

151
00:19:17,462 --> 00:19:20,798
There is the Nile, and there is the sea.

152
00:19:27,890 --> 00:19:29,099
Wait here for me.

153
00:19:30,477 --> 00:19:31,645
I'll come back for you.

154
00:19:37,985 --> 00:19:39,153
In the desert...

155
00:19:40,196 --> 00:19:41,490
a man forgets...

156
00:19:42,074 --> 00:19:43,492
...that he even has a name.

157
00:19:46,203 --> 00:19:47,538
I won't forget.

158
00:19:51,376 --> 00:19:53,963
Salam, Augustin.

159
00:19:55,256 --> 00:19:56,465
Salut.

160
00:20:02,597 --> 00:20:03,597
Salam.

161
00:21:25,653 --> 00:21:26,905
This color [...]

162
00:21:37,960 --> 00:21:39,294
Apricot ice.

163
00:21:49,264 --> 00:21:50,264
Augustin...

164
00:22:12,875 --> 00:22:14,252
Augustin!

165
00:22:33,899 --> 00:22:35,443
What are these names?

166
00:22:55,925 --> 00:22:57,177
From the sea.

167
00:23:39,059 --> 00:23:40,061
Come on.

168
00:23:41,479 --> 00:23:43,648
Come on, that's a girl.

169
00:23:45,859 --> 00:23:48,821
Just one foot in front of the other.

170
00:25:28,312 --> 00:25:30,732
Lazy... good for nothing.

171
00:25:30,857 --> 00:25:32,067
March!

172
00:25:36,447 --> 00:25:42,287
One... two... three... four...

173
00:25:43,414 --> 00:25:46,000
five... six...

174
00:26:30,052 --> 00:26:31,052
Wait!

175
00:26:51,576 --> 00:26:52,953
Help!

176
00:28:48,004 --> 00:28:49,131
Don't curse me.

177
00:28:49,632 --> 00:28:50,674
I'm French.

178
00:28:51,675 --> 00:28:54,136
Faranzi. Faranzi.

179
00:28:55,972 --> 00:28:57,057
Not your enemy.

180
00:28:58,558 --> 00:28:59,601
Your friend.

181
00:29:00,937 --> 00:29:02,021
Your friend.

182
00:29:20,167 --> 00:29:21,335
Yes, look.

183
00:29:22,753 --> 00:29:24,089
Blue eyes.

184
00:29:29,010 --> 00:29:30,179
Like the sky.

185
00:31:37,244 --> 00:31:41,207
Night is coming.
Let the Jinn destroy him.

186
00:31:44,837 --> 00:31:47,131
Jinn, the nigh is yours.

187
00:31:47,214 --> 00:31:49,634
But in the morning the Frenchman is mine.

188
00:33:43,642 --> 00:33:45,019
Cowards!

189
00:33:47,564 --> 00:33:48,564
Come out.

190
00:33:50,067 --> 00:33:51,067
Fight!

191
00:34:51,264 --> 00:34:53,015
Apricot ice.

192
00:41:24,808 --> 00:41:26,519
Good bye, good riddance.

193
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:41,271
Drink.

194
00:44:29,774 --> 00:44:31,443
Move! Move!

195
00:44:33,112 --> 00:44:34,197
Move!

196
00:47:03,996 --> 00:47:06,041
In the Father and the Son
and the Holy Ghost.

197
00:47:11,923 --> 00:47:14,217
Wait!

198
00:51:45,118 --> 00:51:47,370
One... two... three... four...

199
00:51:48,955 --> 00:51:50,625
About face!

200
00:52:53,990 --> 00:52:54,990
Hey!

201
00:52:56,034 --> 00:52:58,203
What are you doing?
Give me back my coat.

202
00:53:04,961 --> 00:53:05,961
Hey!

203
00:53:06,505 --> 00:53:08,382
Give me back my coat.

204
00:53:09,425 --> 00:53:10,425
Give it to me.

205
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:14,806
Come here.

206
00:53:17,977 --> 00:53:20,271
It's about time
you had the name, kitty-cat.

207
00:53:25,777 --> 00:53:26,903
Cleopatra.

208
00:53:27,195 --> 00:53:28,739
Queen of the South.

209
00:53:29,699 --> 00:53:32,535
No. She had a sad ending.

210
00:53:39,460 --> 00:53:40,460
Janette?

211
00:53:42,672 --> 00:53:44,090
Definitely not Janette.

212
00:53:45,967 --> 00:53:47,511
Louise Colette?

213
00:53:49,138 --> 00:53:50,431
Prettiest wet.

214
00:53:52,684 --> 00:53:54,645
Come back! I was playing!

215
00:53:54,853 --> 00:53:55,853
Come here.

216
00:53:56,188 --> 00:53:57,188
Hey!

217
00:54:06,033 --> 00:54:08,243
Emme... Estelle...

218
00:54:10,330 --> 00:54:11,539
Marie...

219
00:54:13,291 --> 00:54:14,918
She sang in the dark for me.

220
00:54:23,887 --> 00:54:25,472
How about an Arab name?

221
00:54:26,139 --> 00:54:27,558
Aisha!

222
00:54:30,770 --> 00:54:33,983
She danced the sword for me in Cairo.

223
00:54:43,368 --> 00:54:44,786
Sultana.

224
00:54:46,622 --> 00:54:47,622
Salome.

225
00:54:47,748 --> 00:54:48,833
My head...

226
00:54:50,334 --> 00:54:51,545
on a tray.

227
00:54:53,422 --> 00:54:54,756
Nefretete.

228
00:54:56,258 --> 00:54:57,969
Isessa.

229
00:55:03,142 --> 00:55:04,142
Sheba.

230
00:55:09,858 --> 00:55:10,858
Abushal.

231
00:55:14,238 --> 00:55:15,323
Shakira.

232
00:55:17,575 --> 00:55:18,576
Josephine.

233
00:55:26,878 --> 00:55:28,004
You wanna dance, hm?

234
00:55:44,774 --> 00:55:46,734
Ah, you have a beauty spot.

235
00:55:46,942 --> 00:55:49,696
Right here.

236
00:55:50,656 --> 00:55:51,656
A few.

237
00:55:56,996 --> 00:55:58,748
What shall I call you?

238
00:56:04,463 --> 00:56:05,923
Soul of the wind.

239
00:56:11,888 --> 00:56:12,932
Simoom.

240
00:57:00,362 --> 00:57:01,405
Beautiful.

241
00:57:02,531 --> 00:57:03,574
Beautiful.

242
00:57:57,429 --> 00:57:58,429
Hey, Simoom...

243
00:57:58,722 --> 00:57:59,515
Come here.

244
00:57:59,682 --> 00:58:00,724
It's your move.

245
00:58:09,568 --> 00:58:11,570
All right. I'll move.

246
00:58:21,874 --> 00:58:23,543
And... your move.

247
00:58:32,011 --> 00:58:33,179
Hey, what's got into you?

248
00:58:36,308 --> 00:58:37,350
Simoom?

249
00:58:40,104 --> 00:58:41,104
Simoom?

250
00:58:46,236 --> 00:58:48,947
Jinn, my goats are thirsty.

251
00:58:49,072 --> 00:58:51,743
Drink, so that we may drink.

252
00:59:42,678 --> 00:59:43,929
Who knows we are here?

253
01:01:27,425 --> 01:01:29,219
He thinks we are Jinns.

254
01:01:46,989 --> 01:01:48,282
Simoom.

255
01:01:51,286 --> 01:01:55,082
We marched all day with dreams
of golden isles.

256
01:02:11,101 --> 01:02:12,101
Simoom?

257
01:03:02,411 --> 01:03:03,411
Simoom!

258
01:04:24,507 --> 01:04:25,507
What?

259
01:04:36,772 --> 01:04:37,773
Simoom?

260
01:04:52,916 --> 01:04:53,916
Wait!

261
01:04:59,048 --> 01:05:00,048
Please.

262
01:06:02,164 --> 01:06:03,665
Simoom!

263
01:06:14,511 --> 01:06:16,263
Simoom!

264
01:14:52,743 --> 01:14:54,829
Sweet Jesus provide for me.

265
01:16:28,063 --> 01:16:29,063
Jesus!

266
01:17:07,026 --> 01:17:08,527
Where have you been?

267
01:20:01,313 --> 01:20:02,439
I won't forget you.

268
01:20:15,288 --> 01:20:16,288
I'll be back.

269
01:20:17,958 --> 01:20:18,959
Simoom...

270
01:20:23,005 --> 01:20:24,507
I want you to wait for me here.

271
01:21:05,722 --> 01:21:06,765
I will come back.

272
01:21:10,436 --> 01:21:11,771
If I don't go to them...

273
01:21:12,230 --> 01:21:14,857
I will be a deserter and they'll
shoot me. Do you understand?

274
01:21:16,568 --> 01:21:17,819
A deserter!

275
01:21:31,794 --> 01:21:32,920
A deserter!

276
01:22:16,638 --> 01:22:18,432
No. No!

277
01:22:18,599 --> 01:22:19,599
Stop!

278
01:22:34,784 --> 01:22:35,784
No!

279
01:26:29,184 --> 01:26:34,065
"She was white like the sands,
tawny like the sands,

280
01:26:34,148 --> 01:26:38,987
solitary and burning like the sands"
/Honore de Balzac

281
01:26:50,251 --> 01:26:55,257
From the novella "A PASSION IN THE DESERT"
by Honore de Balzac

282
01:31:19,316 --> 01:31:23,446
Dedicated to all wild animals
