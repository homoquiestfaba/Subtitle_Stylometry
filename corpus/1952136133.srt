Who is your gorgeous friend?

you ought to see his wife.

Is his wife as understanding
as yours is?

Uh, she's understanding.
Not <i>that</i> understanding.

am I supposed to do with this?

have a great day today.

Candy could do a lot better,
you know.

114
00:05:16,096 --> 00:05:19,190
Hey, when we got married,
Sylvie looked like Angela,

I looked like you,
then the kids came along.

Nothing wrong with a little
side action now and then.

Oh, well, then,
I guess you wouldn't mind

119
00:05:27,741 --> 00:05:30,005
if Sylvie got "a little side action
now and then."

120
00:05:30,377 --> 00:05:34,507

You're gonna be here one day.

- No, you're not in love.
- Yes, I am.

Well, I can't say anything yet,

except that he is everything
a woman would ever want in a man,

142
00:06:30,870 --> 00:06:32,201
except he's gay.

143
00:06:40,213 --> 00:06:43,273
Ms. Black, you still have not
answered my question.

144
00:06:43,583 --> 00:06:47,451
Do you truly believe that you
deserve more of my client's money?

145
00:06:47,954 --> 00:06:51,117
It says explicitly in the contract.

146
00:06:51,324 --> 00:06:51,949
Contract?

147
00:06:52,058 --> 00:06:54,618
How about the contract you signed
when you said "I do"?

148
00:06:54,828 --> 00:06:57,661
I tend to remember an important
clause in that contract,

149
00:06:57,864 --> 00:06:58,592
"for better or for worse."

150
00:06:58,698 --> 00:07:00,029
Does that ring a bell?

151
00:07:00,200 --> 00:07:00,894
Objection!

152
00:07:01,134 --> 00:07:02,567
Speaks to character, Your Honor.

153
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,468
I'll allow it.

154
00:07:05,071 --> 00:07:06,470

Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
Circumstantial!

156
00:07:08,708 --> 00:07:10,801
There's not one piece
of physical evidence

157
00:07:10,910 --> 00:07:12,571
that proves my client strayed.

158
00:07:12,746 --> 00:07:13,974
What about the text messages?

159
00:07:14,280 --> 00:07:15,247
The photos?

160
00:07:15,582 --> 00:07:18,517
What about that filthy video
on YouTube?

161
00:07:19,152 --> 00:07:20,346

163
00:07:21,554 --> 00:07:23,021
Tread carefully, Counselor.

164
00:07:23,189 --> 00:07:24,918
You never see my client's face
in any of them.

165
00:07:25,024 --> 00:07:27,356
Ms. Black, you still have not
answered my question.

166
00:07:27,827 --> 00:07:30,523
My client has graciously
given you and your children

167
00:07:30,630 --> 00:07:34,566
the family home with an estimated
value of 4 million dollars.

168
00:07:34,734 --> 00:07:35,962
That's 4.5.

169
00:07:36,302 --> 00:07:39,271
4.5 million dollars.

170
00:07:39,372 --> 00:07:42,466
Do you really believe
that you deserve more than that?

171
00:07:45,545 --> 00:07:48,173
He signed a contract.

172
00:07:48,615 --> 00:07:51,049
"He signed the contract."

173
00:07:51,151 --> 00:07:52,846
Does that sound heartfelt,
Your Honor?

174
00:07:52,952 --> 00:07:53,646
Does that sound like someone

175
00:07:53,887 --> 00:07:56,082
who truly believes
that they deserve more money?

176
00:07:56,189 --> 00:07:57,918
- Does that...?
- Objection, Your Honor.

177
00:07:58,024 --> 00:08:01,289
Is my client going to be asked
a question in the foreseeable future?

178
00:08:01,594 --> 00:08:05,121
I have nothing further. I couldn't
have answered it better myself.

179
00:08:08,301 --> 00:08:11,464
No fist-bumping in court.

180
00:08:27,220 --> 00:08:28,983
Nice suit, John.

181
00:08:29,088 --> 00:08:30,248
That tie...

182
00:08:39,999 --> 00:08:40,966
Good morning, Mary!

183
00:08:55,648 --> 00:09:00,881
Okay. For the woman
about to start a family,

184
00:09:01,554 --> 00:09:06,048
we present the allure
of "Baby on Board" perfume

185
00:09:06,159 --> 00:09:07,649
to keep Daddy interested,

186
00:09:07,827 --> 00:09:13,857
the only fragrance especially made
for the pregnant woman in love.

187
00:09:15,802 --> 00:09:20,102
And here is the bottle prototype.

188
00:09:20,373 --> 00:09:23,433
Do you think someone
could possibly pass me the bottle

189
00:09:23,643 --> 00:09:30,412
of this soon-to-be
best-selling scent?

190
00:09:33,052 --> 00:09:35,282
[Belly growls]

191
00:09:37,757 --> 00:09:40,487
I'm sorry.
Nervous stomach.

192
00:09:51,738 --> 00:09:54,229
[Belly squeals]

193
00:09:58,912 --> 00:10:00,846
[Farts]

194
00:10:08,655 --> 00:10:11,146
[Inhales deeply]

195
00:10:21,701 --> 00:10:22,759
What is in this bottle?

196
00:10:23,703 --> 00:10:24,965
Perfume.

197
00:10:25,271 --> 00:10:27,136
For who?
The walking dead?

198
00:10:28,308 --> 00:10:30,799
I'm sorry. It's me.

199
00:10:30,910 --> 00:10:33,105
I just...
I ate something bad.

200
00:10:33,212 --> 00:10:39,242
I have a 4:10 meeting
with the reps from Saks,

201
00:10:39,485 --> 00:10:43,615
and I just hope for your sake
this doesn't cling to me.

202
00:10:43,723 --> 00:10:47,716
For the rest of you, I suggest you
open some windows for ventilation.

203
00:10:47,827 --> 00:10:49,454
Try not to jump out.

204
00:10:57,170 --> 00:10:59,661
I'm sorry.

205
00:11:04,444 --> 00:11:06,878
So? What did they say?

206
00:11:06,980 --> 00:11:09,972
Oh, sweet Jesus!

207
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,743
Honey, did something
crawl up your ass and die?

208
00:11:11,851 --> 00:11:13,216
I blew it!

209
00:11:13,486 --> 00:11:16,182
Yes, yes. "Blew it" are
the operative words, all right.

210
00:11:16,356 --> 00:11:17,448
- I'm sick.
- Oh, God!

211
00:11:17,590 --> 00:11:20,559
No, no, honey. Sick is like,
"Poop, poop!" "Tee-hee!"

212
00:11:20,660 --> 00:11:22,525
Oh, God.
That is demonic.

213
00:11:22,628 --> 00:11:24,027
You are not helping.

214
00:11:24,163 --> 00:11:26,654
The power of Christ compels you!
The power of Christ compels you!

215
00:11:26,866 --> 00:11:28,333
Raphy, I have to get her
to approve this stuff.

216
00:11:28,501 --> 00:11:31,732
Honey, I know.
She will, okay? She will.

217
00:11:31,838 --> 00:11:34,068
WOMAN: <i>Angela Marks,</i>
<i>are you still there?</i>

218
00:11:34,173 --> 00:11:35,640
Yes, I'm still here.

219
00:11:35,742 --> 00:11:37,869
WOMAN: <i>Mary would like</i>
<i>to see you in her office.</i>

220
00:11:39,479 --> 00:11:42,505
- I'll be right there.
- Jesus! That was fast.

221
00:11:46,419 --> 00:11:47,852
[Chuckles]

222
00:11:47,954 --> 00:11:49,922
Seriously, that was great.

223
00:11:50,023 --> 00:11:51,615
I thought I'd never get out
of that pre-nup.

224
00:11:51,724 --> 00:11:52,986
Honey, come here and meet Curtis.

225
00:11:53,359 --> 00:11:55,156
I told you he'd do it.

226
00:11:55,361 --> 00:11:57,852
This is my ex-wife's cousin.
Worth every penny.

227
00:11:57,964 --> 00:11:59,124
Come on.

228
00:11:59,232 --> 00:12:00,665
Let's go buy a sex swing.

229
00:12:01,868 --> 00:12:03,995
Okay, Uncle Phil.

230
00:12:04,103 --> 00:12:05,502
[Inhales]

231
00:12:23,289 --> 00:12:25,223
- You are amazing.
- Excuse me?

232
00:12:25,324 --> 00:12:28,316
I'm sorry.
My name is Arlene Jenkins.

233
00:12:28,428 --> 00:12:31,659
Everyone says the same thing
about you, "There's none better,"

234
00:12:31,831 --> 00:12:33,890
but I had to see it for myself.

235
00:12:34,033 --> 00:12:38,470
Oh, my. I grew faint just the way
you pounded away at that woman.

236
00:12:38,704 --> 00:12:41,104
What can I do for you, Mrs. Jenkins?

237
00:12:41,307 --> 00:12:43,172
There's a lot you can do <i>to</i> me.

238
00:12:43,276 --> 00:12:44,038
Okay.

239
00:12:44,544 --> 00:12:47,240
It's my husband.
He's a liar.

240
00:12:47,380 --> 00:12:49,439
But I'm sad to say
I see a lot of that.

241
00:12:49,549 --> 00:12:50,948
The son of a bitch
told me he was dying,

242
00:12:51,117 --> 00:12:53,051
and that's the only reason
I married him.

243
00:12:53,319 --> 00:12:54,183
So, he is...?

244
00:12:54,287 --> 00:12:55,720
97.

245
00:12:55,822 --> 00:12:56,186
Oh.

246
00:12:56,289 --> 00:12:59,224
Have you ever had
a 97-year-old man on top of you?

247
00:13:00,693 --> 00:13:02,388
It's like fucking a beanbag chair.

248
00:13:03,162 --> 00:13:04,390
I didn't need to hear that.

249
00:13:04,497 --> 00:13:05,691
We just got his medical report.

250
00:13:05,798 --> 00:13:08,562
Besides the fact that he's on an
oxygen tank, he's healthy as a hog.

251
00:13:08,668 --> 00:13:10,067
He'll probably outlive me.

252
00:13:10,169 --> 00:13:11,898
I'm not sure
what you want me to do.

253
00:13:12,105 --> 00:13:15,632
This is my pre-nup.
I need a way out.

254
00:13:16,209 --> 00:13:17,540
Sure you want to leave with...?

255
00:13:17,677 --> 00:13:19,201
With as much as I can carry.

256
00:13:19,846 --> 00:13:22,246
Ms. Jenkins, I shouldn't be looking
at this material.

257
00:13:22,448 --> 00:13:25,110
- Mr. Marks.
- Curtis.

258
00:13:25,218 --> 00:13:26,913
Curtis.

259
00:13:27,019 --> 00:13:28,418
I need <i>you.</i>

260
00:13:32,425 --> 00:13:37,362
Okay, I will take a look at this,
and my office will be in touch.

261
00:13:37,630 --> 00:13:39,757
Thank you...

262
00:13:39,866 --> 00:13:42,232
...Curtis.

263
00:13:59,051 --> 00:14:01,246
You can sit...

264
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:04,255
...unless sitting makes
your problem worse.

265
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,423
I'm really sorry about that.
I think I'm okay now.

266
00:14:12,832 --> 00:14:13,992
Is this your family?

267
00:14:14,433 --> 00:14:16,867
- Wow, your daughter is so...
- No. It came with the frame.

268
00:14:17,236 --> 00:14:22,299
92.1% of men prefer to deal
with a woman who has a family.

269
00:14:22,508 --> 00:14:26,171
You know how many men want
to <i>hire</i> a woman that has a family?

270
00:14:26,412 --> 00:14:28,380
8.1%.

271
00:14:28,548 --> 00:14:32,177
Which just proves conclusively
that men are stupid.

272
00:14:33,719 --> 00:14:38,486
Now, speaking of stupid,

273
00:14:39,258 --> 00:14:41,658
for the woman
who is about to start a family,

274
00:14:42,828 --> 00:14:44,227
I should have thrown you
out of that conference room

275
00:14:44,330 --> 00:14:46,195
for suggesting something
so Sesame Street,

276
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:49,732
but unfortunately I have a board
that I have to answer to,

277
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:51,166
and they have voted.

278
00:14:53,272 --> 00:14:54,296
You're approved.

279
00:14:55,341 --> 00:14:58,333
Now, listen to me.
Listen to me really good.

280
00:14:58,444 --> 00:15:01,504
You screw this up,
it is your ass on the line.

281
00:15:02,815 --> 00:15:09,084
Now, I expect a budget and marketing
analysis on my desk in one week.

282
00:15:09,388 --> 00:15:10,377
Get out.

283
00:15:51,163 --> 00:15:53,393
- Wow! What's that for?
- I missed you today.

284
00:15:53,499 --> 00:15:55,126
Me too. Guess what?

285
00:15:55,234 --> 00:15:56,895
Tell me, how did it go?

286
00:15:57,003 --> 00:15:58,732
Mary said yes.

287
00:15:58,838 --> 00:16:00,396
- She said yes?
- Yes! She said yes!

288
00:16:00,506 --> 00:16:01,530
Fist-pound.

289
00:16:01,641 --> 00:16:04,337
Angela, I don't believe this.
This is... This is amazing.

290
00:16:04,443 --> 00:16:06,502
You are gonna have
your own perfume line.

291
00:16:06,712 --> 00:16:09,203
I know. I mean,
this is put up or shut up time.

292
00:16:09,315 --> 00:16:11,010
All those years
in college and business school

293
00:16:11,117 --> 00:16:12,812
and then months
slaving away as an intern.

294
00:16:12,918 --> 00:16:13,850
Can you believe this?

295
00:16:13,953 --> 00:16:16,080
Vice-president of one
of the biggest cosmetic companies

296
00:16:16,188 --> 00:16:17,086
in all of the world!

297
00:16:17,189 --> 00:16:19,180
This is huge!
This is my everything!

298
00:16:19,292 --> 00:16:20,782
Everything?

299
00:16:20,926 --> 00:16:22,450
Well, present company excluded.

300
00:16:22,561 --> 00:16:23,289
Mm.

301
00:16:23,396 --> 00:16:24,556
Um, Angela,

302
00:16:24,730 --> 00:16:28,598
since this "Baby on Board" thing
is such a big deal,

303
00:16:28,768 --> 00:16:32,602
maybe you and I should start trying.

304
00:16:33,639 --> 00:16:34,537
Trying?

305
00:16:34,907 --> 00:16:37,637
Trying to make a baby.

306
00:16:37,743 --> 00:16:40,940
You know, lose the condoms.

307
00:16:41,047 --> 00:16:42,742
Ahh...

308
00:16:44,116 --> 00:16:45,447
You okay?

309
00:16:46,352 --> 00:16:47,376
Hmm.

310
00:16:47,653 --> 00:16:51,680
Here we are.

311
00:16:56,162 --> 00:16:58,130
- Why would we want to do that?
- For research.

312
00:16:58,230 --> 00:17:00,664
We'll get you pregnant,
and then you'll know exactly...

313
00:17:05,905 --> 00:17:07,668
Sorry.

314
00:17:12,311 --> 00:17:14,006
Sorry about that.

315
00:17:14,113 --> 00:17:15,740
Here you go.

316
00:17:26,859 --> 00:17:29,259
You're certainly eating a lot.

317
00:17:29,662 --> 00:17:32,927
Before you get mad,
I don't mean that in a fat-people way.

318
00:17:33,032 --> 00:17:36,490
I just mean that you're consuming
more food than usual.

319
00:17:36,602 --> 00:17:38,627
Well, it emptied me out,
and now I got to fill me back up.

320
00:17:39,705 --> 00:17:41,639
Are you listening to me?

321
00:17:41,841 --> 00:17:44,207
No one's listening to you,
you big lush.

322
00:17:44,310 --> 00:17:45,743
[Chuckles]

323
00:17:45,845 --> 00:17:50,077
Look. All I'm saying is
guys like the chase.

324
00:17:50,316 --> 00:17:51,715
You take a guy, he gets married,

325
00:17:51,817 --> 00:17:55,048
and it's like, it's like putting
a wolf in a cage, all right?

326
00:17:55,221 --> 00:18:00,124
Every chick that walks by,
it's like a fresh, tasty rib-eye.

327
00:18:00,259 --> 00:18:01,317
Danny, come on.

328
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,395
Maybe we should
get a breath of fresh air.

329
00:18:03,496 --> 00:18:05,794
What? I'm just trying
to make a point.

330
00:18:05,998 --> 00:18:07,124
And that would be what?

331
00:18:08,367 --> 00:18:09,095
Tell them.

332
00:18:10,035 --> 00:18:10,797
- Me?
- Yeah, you tell them.

333
00:18:10,903 --> 00:18:16,637
Uh, well, we're all aware of the fact
that wealthy men pay for sex.

334
00:18:17,443 --> 00:18:19,138
Oh, we are? Are we?

335
00:18:19,412 --> 00:18:21,573
- I think it's disgusting.
- Good.

336
00:18:21,680 --> 00:18:23,875
Are you having sex with prostitutes?

337
00:18:28,320 --> 00:18:29,878
No.

338
00:18:33,893 --> 00:18:35,622
Wait, Sylvie. Did I tell you
about my meeting today with Mary?

339
00:18:35,728 --> 00:18:37,195
Danny, did I tell you
about the new client that we got?

340
00:18:37,563 --> 00:18:41,795
Look, all I'm saying is
there are some guys out there

341
00:18:41,901 --> 00:18:46,133
who get a little gash on the side,
and they have to pay for it.

342
00:18:46,272 --> 00:18:48,172
It's the only way
they can get it, all right?

343
00:18:48,274 --> 00:18:49,707
And I don't have that problem,

344
00:18:50,576 --> 00:18:52,806
'cause I got the looks,
and I got the money.

345
00:18:52,912 --> 00:18:54,607
I got it all, baby! High-five!

347
00:18:57,850 --> 00:19:00,011
You know, women are looking
for a lot more in a relationship

348
00:19:00,119 --> 00:19:01,518
than looks and money.

349

You're so drunk.

00:19:04,790 --> 00:19:08,692
Um, you know what? Why don't we
actually just get out of here?

Why don't <i>you</i>
raise the kids for a while

357
00:19:18,571 --> 00:19:21,540
while I go out and find every possible
excuse to stay away from the house?

358
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:24,470
Then you can spend all day

and the vomit, and the laundry,
and the groceries,

360
00:19:26,412 --> 00:19:29,347
and shoveling the goddamn snow
in the fucking driveway.

361
00:19:29,515 --> 00:19:30,209
Why don't you do all those things,

362

and then you can pay whoever

You want to talk about stress?

367
00:19:46,465 --> 00:19:48,660
Maybe I should go visit
a Korean hand-job parlor

368
00:19:48,767 --> 00:19:50,462

in the office do.

Maybe I will join them.

00:19:57,977 --> 00:19:59,911
Honey, nobody wants to fuck you.

with two condoms on.

or a little more ugly.

I turned around the other day,

520
00:29:48,366 --> 00:29:51,267
and my left tit
knocked over a toaster.

521
00:29:51,369 --> 00:29:53,303
You have great tits.
Your tits are beautiful.

522
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:56,067
- They're not! They're saggy!
- No, they're not!

523
00:29:56,241 --> 00:29:57,640
And after Ryan,

524
00:29:57,742 --> 00:30:01,234
Jesus Christ, you could have
smuggled Mexicans over the border

525
00:30:01,346 --> 00:30:02,244
in my vagina.

526
00:30:03,048 --> 00:30:04,037
Enormous!

527
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:05,309
You have a great vagina.

528
00:30:05,417 --> 00:30:07,817
Any man would be lucky
to be in your vagina.

529
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,917
You should see
the way he looks at me.

530
00:30:10,021 --> 00:30:13,582
It is like I stole
something from him.

531
00:30:13,892 --> 00:30:15,154
Of course I'm not okay
with the cheating,

532
00:30:15,260 --> 00:30:19,390
but if that's what it took
to keep him, I would...

533
00:30:19,498 --> 00:30:24,561
But at some point he just...
He just stopped caring.

534
00:30:24,903 --> 00:30:27,463
And I can deal with a lot of things,
but I can't deal with that.

535
00:30:30,242 --> 00:30:32,403
I wish I were a lesbian.

536
00:30:35,380 --> 00:30:37,075
Hold on one second, okay?

537
00:30:46,391 --> 00:30:53,524
Girl, I am not a doctor,
but you have got a bug or something.

538
00:30:58,937 --> 00:31:03,169
So, how is my girl?

539
00:31:03,441 --> 00:31:04,430
Not so hot.

540
00:31:04,609 --> 00:31:05,974
Well, you look pretty hot to me.

541
00:31:07,679 --> 00:31:09,943
What's, uh, what's going on
inside of you?

542
00:31:10,182 --> 00:31:11,809
I can't keep anything down.

543
00:31:12,484 --> 00:31:13,678
Really?

544
00:31:13,785 --> 00:31:15,719
Have you experienced
morning sickness?

545
00:31:15,854 --> 00:31:18,379
No way!
I mean, I threw up this morning,

546
00:31:18,490 --> 00:31:20,481
but it's not morning sickness.

547
00:31:21,193 --> 00:31:22,125
Gas?

548
00:31:24,296 --> 00:31:25,923
What are we talking about?

549
00:31:27,866 --> 00:31:31,427
[Beeping]

550
00:31:38,610 --> 00:31:39,702
Look at this.

551
00:31:42,180 --> 00:31:43,374
Angela...

552
00:31:45,016 --> 00:31:45,880
...you're pregnant.

553
00:31:47,586 --> 00:31:50,555
No way!
Curtis wears protection.

554
00:31:50,655 --> 00:31:54,921
Well, one little guy snuck in,
and it only takes one.

555
00:31:55,193 --> 00:31:57,218
This can't be.

556
00:31:57,329 --> 00:31:58,660
Damn him!

557
00:31:58,830 --> 00:32:01,924
Angela, do you know how many
women who can't get pregnant

558
00:32:02,033 --> 00:32:03,728
would love to be
in your shoes right now?

559
00:32:03,902 --> 00:32:06,268
I can't fit into my shoes.

560
00:32:06,771 --> 00:32:09,968
I have so much going on right now.
This is the wrong time!

561
00:32:10,075 --> 00:32:12,373
Angela, as your friend,
I need to tell you this.

562
00:32:12,477 --> 00:32:15,844
It's never the right time.
I see women in here all day long,

563
00:32:15,947 --> 00:32:19,075
and even when they think they're
not able to handle this, they are.

564
00:32:20,352 --> 00:32:26,587
Hey, you may not think you're ready,
but your body is telling you it is.

565
00:32:27,259 --> 00:32:28,556
You feel better?

566
00:32:29,327 --> 00:32:30,851
No!

567
00:32:33,398 --> 00:32:34,558
Thank you.

568
00:32:34,666 --> 00:32:36,861
Mrs. Jenkins, I've got it.

569
00:32:37,035 --> 00:32:38,195
I bet you do.

570
00:32:39,004 --> 00:32:41,837
Would you say
that your husband treats you well?

571
00:32:41,973 --> 00:32:43,031
He gives me everything I want.

572
00:32:43,141 --> 00:32:45,541
Okay, okay.
Is it good enough?

573
00:32:45,744 --> 00:32:46,836
Oh.

574
00:32:46,945 --> 00:32:49,345
Your pre-nup,
Section 14, Article 3A,

575
00:32:49,447 --> 00:32:50,744
hinges on your standard of living,

576
00:32:50,982 --> 00:32:53,610
which Mr. Jenkins
is obligated to provide.

577
00:32:53,752 --> 00:32:56,346
If he does not,
your pre-nup is null and void.

578
00:32:56,454 --> 00:33:00,413
So, I'm going to ask you again,
Mrs. Jenkins,

579
00:33:00,725 --> 00:33:02,022
is it good enough?

580
00:33:09,734 --> 00:33:12,726
I'm not pregnant.
I'm not pregnant.

581
00:33:12,837 --> 00:33:13,769
I'm not pregnant, okay?

582
00:33:13,872 --> 00:33:15,533
I don't want to be pregnant.
I don't feel pregnant.

583
00:33:15,640 --> 00:33:17,335
And you know what?
I'm never having sex again.

584
00:33:17,442 --> 00:33:19,376
He lied to me.
He said that Chucky was covered,

585
00:33:19,477 --> 00:33:21,411
little Chucky with two raincoats.

586
00:33:21,513 --> 00:33:23,208
Yeah, well, I got to go, lady.

587
00:33:23,315 --> 00:33:24,509
Be glad you're not a woman.

588
00:33:24,616 --> 00:33:25,947
Okay. Thank you.

589
00:33:39,164 --> 00:33:43,157
I have never been
so turned on in all of my life.

590
00:33:43,468 --> 00:33:44,400
Mrs. Jenkins! Mrs. Jenkins!

591
00:33:44,636 --> 00:33:46,627
Mm, Mr. Marks!

592
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:02,580
Oh, Mr. Marks!

593
00:34:02,687 --> 00:34:04,382
Mrs. Jenkins,
Mrs. Jenkins, Mrs. Jenkins.

594
00:34:04,489 --> 00:34:06,184
Please, Mrs. Jenkins.
Mrs. Jenkins, stop it!

595
00:34:06,291 --> 00:34:07,986
Mrs. Jenkins, get off of me!
Come on!

596
00:34:08,093 --> 00:34:10,561
I'm sorry.
You're just so, so devious.

597
00:34:10,662 --> 00:34:13,688
Yes, I... I took two classes
on the subject at Harvard.

598
00:34:13,798 --> 00:34:14,856
I hated them both.

599
00:34:15,066 --> 00:34:17,000
Mrs. Jenkins, please, please,
get my thumb...

600
00:34:17,102 --> 00:34:18,501
You can't do that to my thumb.

Son of a bitch!

602
00:34:29,681 --> 00:34:31,911
He was making out with her
in front of the whole restaurant.

603
00:34:32,083 --> 00:34:34,677
That son of a bitch.

Oh, honey. I'm gonna
come right over right now.

610

- Hello.
- Oh, I'll call you back. He's here.

Oh, okay.

What's up?

618
00:35:06,484 --> 00:35:07,951
You know what's up.

619
00:35:08,052 --> 00:35:09,519
Really?
You're gonna have to tell me,

620
00:35:09,621 --> 00:35:11,714
because I have no idea what
you're trying to pull me into here.

621
00:35:11,856 --> 00:35:14,051
- It's not a what. It's a who.
- A who? What who?

622

What who? You who!
That's what, who.

I'm sorry.

Come on, Ang.
What's going on?

00:35:19,831 --> 00:35:23,062
Nothing is going on here,
and nothing will go on here.

626
00:35:23,635 --> 00:35:27,799
Okay. Well, then, this fight
that we aren't really having is over.

627

- No.
- No?

Angela, something's wrong.
I don't know what it is.

631

Did something happen
at work today?

632
00:35:36,247 --> 00:35:37,771
- Don't change the subject!
- What subject?

633
00:35:38,483 --> 00:35:40,314

- Yes. Angie, Ang.

but we're gonna make it work, okay?

What is wrong with you?

640
00:36:03,408 --> 00:36:06,206
I know plenty of women who
would be jumping for joy right now.

and be happy about this.

isn't who I thought he would be?

Don't be ridiculous.

648
00:36:34,772 --> 00:36:37,866
You said it yourself.
She's hiding something, right?

649
00:36:38,142 --> 00:36:40,838
"The father isn't who I thought
he was." What's that bullshit?

650
00:36:40,945 --> 00:36:44,142
She's probably banging
some 7-foot-tall black brother.

You always use two skins.
You always double-bag it, right?

- Yes.
- All right. Look here.

Look. It says right here,
97% effective.

Now, I'm no math wizard,
but 97 times 2,

infinite protection.

You should have seen Angela's face
when we were arguing.

703
00:40:27,739 --> 00:40:29,263
She was definitely
hiding something,

the way she wasn't saying anything

705
00:40:31,809 --> 00:40:34,300
and kept backing me in a corner,
like I was the one who was cheating.

Oh, yeah. Sylvie used to do
that shit to me all the time.

Yeah, yeah, but she was still
very good at it.

01:01:31,301 --> 01:01:32,734
Well, that's dumb.

1039
01:01:33,203 --> 01:01:34,830
Yeah.

1040
01:01:34,938 --> 01:01:38,931
And I could never see you getting
involved in a dumb tug of war.

1041
01:01:42,645 --> 01:01:46,411
Angela, I'm here for you.
But this has gotten out of hand.

1042
01:01:46,750 --> 01:01:51,813
You love each other.
Just stop with the games.

1043
01:01:54,190 --> 01:01:57,887
You're right. I just...
I don't know how we got here.

1044
01:01:57,994 --> 01:02:02,897
Tomorrow I'm gonna sit down, and
I'm gonna talk to him like an adult.

1045
01:02:04,801 --> 01:02:05,859
What?

1046
01:02:05,969 --> 01:02:07,766
Oh, hell!

1047
01:02:10,440 --> 01:02:12,931
Oh, bastard!

1048
01:02:13,343 --> 01:02:17,143
- Who are those people?
- It's my wife and her lover.

1049
01:02:17,981 --> 01:02:19,414
He's trying to make me jealous.

1050
01:02:19,783 --> 01:02:22,718
- She's fat!
- She's pregnant!

1051
01:02:23,019 --> 01:02:25,010
Isn't that what we're doing?

1052
01:02:25,655 --> 01:02:27,555
We are now!

Come here.

1057
01:02:50,747 --> 01:02:52,180
Well, it took you long enough.

1058
01:02:52,348 --> 01:02:53,474
I'll tell you a secret.

1059
01:02:53,583 --> 01:02:55,346
I thought you might
make a move tonight,

1060
01:02:55,885 --> 01:02:59,184
so I shaved it into a "C,"
just in case.

1061
01:03:00,490 --> 01:03:01,889
For "Curtis."

1062
01:03:02,092 --> 01:03:04,822
Okay, why don't we stop talking?

1063
01:03:14,704 --> 01:03:16,035
Come on, Angie.

Oh, yeah.

Just what's going on here?

1072
01:03:36,292 --> 01:03:38,988
If you don't like it, Dr. Bob,
why don't you and Angela leave?

1073
01:03:39,095 --> 01:03:39,493

My husband!

1076

- That's my bitch, bitch!
- Is this guy serious?

1077
01:03:47,570 --> 01:03:48,662
As a heart attack!

1078

Oh!

That's gonna hurt more tomorrow.

That's good to know.

1088
01:04:18,568 --> 01:04:20,502
You can have the bed if you want,
and I can just go to...

1089
01:04:20,603 --> 01:04:23,800
Dr. Bob's?
Go ahead. Be my guest.

1090
01:04:25,775 --> 01:04:26,935
Curtis.

1091
01:04:28,578 --> 01:04:31,274
How long have you been seeing her?

1092
01:04:31,381 --> 01:04:32,575
Again?

1093
01:04:32,682 --> 01:04:35,515
You keep turning this around on me.

1094
01:04:35,985 --> 01:04:37,452
Don't I get a coma reprieve?

1095
01:04:37,554 --> 01:04:42,321
Why don't you just go see your
doctor friend and leave me alone?

1096
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:52,759
Okay. You win.
I can't do this anymore.

1097
01:05:04,480 --> 01:05:06,778
Did you step it up?

1098
01:05:06,883 --> 01:05:08,851
Is he eating out
of the palm of your hand?

1099
01:05:11,854 --> 01:05:15,187
Honey, I'm sorry.
I'm so, so sorry.

1100
01:05:15,425 --> 01:05:17,916
Come on.
Let's go inside.

1101
01:05:38,982 --> 01:05:42,076
Raphy! Raphy, Raphy!
Oh, where is she?

Uh, who? Angela?

1103
01:05:43,686 --> 01:05:46,678
Oh, I don't know.
She's not in her office?

1104
01:05:46,789 --> 01:05:48,222
I thought she was in her office,
because if she's not,

1105
01:05:48,324 --> 01:05:49,655
then I don't really know, Mary.

1106

need you to listen to me.

The head of Nakashima Distribution
is going to be here in a few hours.

1110
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:02,697
And I want you to present it to him
and his team.

1111
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:04,739
I thought you already did that.

1112
01:06:05,375 --> 01:06:06,865
Angela, I'm thinking
maybe you should take

1113
01:06:06,976 --> 01:06:09,706
a little less time
at the refrigerator

1114
01:06:09,812 --> 01:06:11,677

Where's my coffee?

1116
01:06:13,783 --> 01:06:14,750
That's his secondary team.

1117
01:06:14,851 --> 01:06:19,117
Mr. Nakashima never goes
to the initial first-pitch meeting.

1118
01:06:19,222 --> 01:06:22,623
Oh, no. He just flies halfway
around the world to do that.

1119
01:06:24,827 --> 01:06:28,263
He's on his way to Hawaii
for the re-enactment of Pearl Harbor,

1120
01:06:28,431 --> 01:06:32,231
and he is blessing us
with a few hours of his precious time.

of your glandular problem?

until after I did it.

was good enough.

Oh, what you did
was good enough.

It worked. She's gone.
What did you expect?

Hey, Maureen!
I'm just looking for my, uh...

Sorry.

No, no, no, no, no!
Don't roll over.

1225

Don't roll over, whatever you do.

1226
01:12:56,752 --> 01:12:59,084
If you roll over right now,
Candy is going to jerk you off,

1227
01:12:59,188 --> 01:13:01,383
and that's gonna be the biggest
mistake you could ever make.

1228
01:13:02,158 --> 01:13:05,218
Curtis, I know I talked a mean game.
Hell, I played a mean game.

1229

Half the stains on this ceiling
have come from me.

1230
01:13:07,863 --> 01:13:11,492
A hand-job's just like jerking off.
It's all the same in the end.

1231

Truthfully, I give myself
a hell of a great hand-job.

I know I said the only honest
relationship a man can have

1234
01:13:20,509 --> 01:13:22,534
is with somebody
he's paying, all right?

1235
01:13:22,645 --> 01:13:24,135
But that's not true.
It's bullshit.

1236
01:13:24,313 --> 01:13:27,043
Man, your wife's a real pain
in the ass. They all are.

better than anyone,

1239

And that, that's the most

Am I too late?

1261
01:15:10,386 --> 01:15:12,377
No, no. I chickened out.

1262

I've been hiding out
in the bathroom the last 40 minutes.

Thank God you're a quarter queer.

I'm paying you per hip thrust,

You have a great vagina.

I think any man would be lucky
to be in your vagina.

I mean, to America.
I'm sorry.

On behalf

1618
01:33:58,579 --> 01:34:00,547
Yeah. I would if I was her.
