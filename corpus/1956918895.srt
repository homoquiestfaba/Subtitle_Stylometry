00:29:45,694 --> 00:29:47,030
Tomorrow, I say

719
00:29:47,096 --> 00:29:48,730
we hit the streets!

720
00:29:48,797 --> 00:29:50,099
It's up to us now!

721
00:29:50,165 --> 00:29:52,167
Nope. We're analysts.

722
00:29:52,234 --> 00:29:53,936
We stay right here
in our building

723
00:29:54,003 --> 00:29:55,905
and we monitor the action.

724
00:29:55,972 --> 00:29:57,305
Don't participate in it.

725
00:29:57,372 --> 00:29:59,008
Uh, boring is good.

726
00:29:59,075 --> 00:30:00,208
Remember?

727
00:30:00,275 --> 00:30:02,011
Well, someone out there
knows something

728
00:30:02,078 --> 00:30:04,881
'and I am fully confident
this crew can find out.'

729
00:30:04,947 --> 00:30:06,415
This brand new, how do you do

730
00:30:06,481 --> 00:30:09,251
out of the blue,
cat and dog crew!

731
00:30:10,019 --> 00:30:11,820
Is she okay?

732
00:30:11,888 --> 00:30:13,923
She's just enthusiastic.

733
00:30:17,060 --> 00:30:19,761
(Gwen)
OMG! OMG!

734
00:30:19,828 --> 00:30:22,065
O-M to the G!

735
00:30:22,131 --> 00:30:23,732
This is really happening.

736
00:30:23,799 --> 00:30:26,401
I am outside!

737
00:30:26,468 --> 00:30:28,905
Yes, Seattle.
Outside and it's wet.

738
00:30:28,971 --> 00:30:31,406
It's so much more
than I ever thought it would be.

739
00:30:31,473 --> 00:30:33,910
It's, it's so big.

740
00:30:33,976 --> 00:30:36,278
We're only 20 feet away from
the front door of the building.

741
00:30:36,344 --> 00:30:38,213
There's actually a lot more.

742
00:30:38,280 --> 00:30:41,084
Oh! Look at all this space!

743
00:30:41,150 --> 00:30:42,718
'So much of space!'

744
00:30:44,319 --> 00:30:46,488
Too much space!
Where are all the walls?

745
00:30:46,555 --> 00:30:48,490
Danger!
Danger in every direction!

746
00:30:48,557 --> 00:30:50,692
Gwen, keep it together,
we've got a mission to do.

747
00:30:50,759 --> 00:30:53,795
- Let's just...
- 'Animal control, 5 o'clock!'

748
00:30:55,198 --> 00:30:56,966
(Gwen)
'Our eye in the sky.'

749
00:30:57,033 --> 00:30:59,634
And it's heading right at you.

750
00:30:59,701 --> 00:31:02,437
[dramatic music]

751
00:31:02,504 --> 00:31:04,873
- Scramble! Hide!
- Outside bad!

752
00:31:04,941 --> 00:31:07,676
Outside bad!
Whose idea was this?

753
00:31:15,550 --> 00:31:17,652
Oh, wait, wait, check that.

754
00:31:17,719 --> 00:31:19,922
'False alarm on
the animal control truck.'

755
00:31:19,989 --> 00:31:22,524
My bad.
Just the ice cream vendor.

756
00:31:22,591 --> 00:31:24,961
Uh, uh, think you can
get me a drumstick?

757
00:31:25,027 --> 00:31:26,996
[chuckles]
I just love those things.

758
00:31:27,063 --> 00:31:28,330
[sighs]

759
00:31:28,396 --> 00:31:31,500
[instrumental music]

760
00:31:43,880 --> 00:31:46,481
Before cameras and monitors
and gadgets

761
00:31:46,548 --> 00:31:49,018
we got our information
from combin' the streets.

762
00:31:49,085 --> 00:31:52,554
Like in a cop movie,
just gotta find us a snitch

763
00:31:52,621 --> 00:31:55,323
'a pigeon, a weasel,
a blabbermouth.'

764
00:31:55,390 --> 00:31:58,094
A cheese eater!
Oh! I think I see one.

765
00:31:58,161 --> 00:31:59,795
Cover me.

766
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,200
[instrumental music]

767
00:32:04,267 --> 00:32:06,635
Okay, ankle bitter,
who's behind the plot?

768
00:32:06,701 --> 00:32:09,638
- Oh, boy!
- I'm on to you, cupcake.

769
00:32:09,704 --> 00:32:13,809
And don't think I'm fooled
by the whole Toy Group routine.

770
00:32:13,876 --> 00:32:15,410
Okay, a crafty one.

771
00:32:15,477 --> 00:32:18,780
Guess I need to dispense
with my good cop.

772
00:32:18,847 --> 00:32:21,516
Spill the beans, purse-pooch!

773
00:32:21,583 --> 00:32:24,187
Or you start losin' digits.

774
00:32:24,253 --> 00:32:25,720
[whimpering]

775
00:32:25,787 --> 00:32:27,990
Fingers or toes?

776
00:32:28,057 --> 00:32:29,424
[whimpering]

777
00:32:31,093 --> 00:32:32,360
You think it was too much?

778
00:32:32,427 --> 00:32:34,563
[siren wailing]

779
00:32:39,268 --> 00:32:42,271
Hey, sarge, FART agent 44871.

780
00:32:42,337 --> 00:32:43,605
What's the word on the street?

781
00:32:43,672 --> 00:32:45,407
Little small for an agent.

782
00:32:45,473 --> 00:32:47,310
I'm actually just a monitor.

783
00:32:47,375 --> 00:32:49,644
- Long story.
- Lot of domestic calls.

784
00:32:49,711 --> 00:32:51,546
Mostly cats and dogs
mixin' it up.

785
00:32:51,613 --> 00:32:54,083
Destroyin' property.
You got any leads?

786
00:32:54,150 --> 00:32:55,584
We narrowed it down to this zone

787
00:32:55,650 --> 00:32:58,087
but the perp took out
our comm, so..

788
00:32:58,154 --> 00:32:59,387
...we're hittin' the streets.

789
00:32:59,454 --> 00:33:02,591
Shaggy dog, in the park.
One of our informants.

790
00:33:02,657 --> 00:33:04,994
'Always has the 411.'

791
00:33:05,061 --> 00:33:06,428
[barks]

792
00:33:06,494 --> 00:33:08,630
Tell her Buck sent ya.

793
00:33:08,697 --> 00:33:11,901
Hey! Hey! Keep it off
the hydrants, buddy.

794
00:33:11,968 --> 00:33:14,303
(Buck)
'Hey, shampoodle, glace it up.'

795
00:33:14,369 --> 00:33:16,172
'Hey, buddy,
where's that collar?'

796
00:33:16,239 --> 00:33:18,040
Consider this a warning.

797
00:33:20,742 --> 00:33:24,746
Okay, executing covert approach.

798
00:33:24,813 --> 00:33:27,884
Gotta be cool, not too obvious.

799
00:33:27,950 --> 00:33:30,353
Oops, uh, comin' on too strong,
okay.

800
00:33:30,418 --> 00:33:32,121
Back it up, reset,
acting normal.

801
00:33:32,188 --> 00:33:33,956
Okay, not feeling normal.

802
00:33:34,023 --> 00:33:35,657
What do normal dogs do?

803
00:33:35,724 --> 00:33:37,960
They, they sniff trash cans.

804
00:33:38,027 --> 00:33:39,929
Commence sniffing.

805
00:33:39,996 --> 00:33:42,164
Ooh! Rotting chili dogs.

806
00:33:45,700 --> 00:33:48,104
Better get in on this.

807
00:33:48,170 --> 00:33:51,506
Hey, Shaggy, I hear you've got
a poopscoop around here.

808
00:33:51,573 --> 00:33:55,077
- I keep my eyes open.
- Uh, well..

809
00:33:55,144 --> 00:33:56,544
You see anything lately?

810
00:33:56,611 --> 00:33:58,713
Couple of weeks ago,
I heard whispers

811
00:33:58,780 --> 00:34:01,650
that someone was looking
to hire a job.

812
00:34:01,716 --> 00:34:04,619
A hush-hush kind of a job.

813
00:34:04,686 --> 00:34:06,688
- So, who was it?
- I don't know.

814
00:34:06,755 --> 00:34:08,124
They were right next to me

815
00:34:08,190 --> 00:34:10,825
and this may come
as a bit of a surprise

816
00:34:10,893 --> 00:34:12,395
I didn't see their faces.

817
00:34:12,460 --> 00:34:15,031
- Huh, imagine that.
- Ugh!

818
00:34:15,097 --> 00:34:18,533
Bottom line, if you need
something done around this town

819
00:34:18,600 --> 00:34:20,403
you go to the cats.

820
00:34:20,468 --> 00:34:23,105
- The cats?
- The alley cats.

821
00:34:23,172 --> 00:34:26,909
But they don't come out
till the sun goes down.

822
00:34:33,015 --> 00:34:35,151
[squeaking]

823
00:34:35,217 --> 00:34:39,554
(Pablo) 'When the world lays eyes on
me, they will cower in terror.'

824
00:34:39,621 --> 00:34:40,890
'They didn't think
I was worth loving'

825
00:34:40,957 --> 00:34:43,725
'so now,
they will fear me instead!'

826
00:34:44,961 --> 00:34:46,429
[all gasping]

827
00:34:46,494 --> 00:34:49,731
Oh, no, no, no. Hey, boss.

828
00:34:49,798 --> 00:34:51,533
[chuckling]
That ain't workin' for you.

829
00:34:51,599 --> 00:34:53,501
Really?
I thought hats were scary.

830
00:34:53,568 --> 00:34:57,872
- Um, not that one.
- Okay. Okay.

831
00:34:57,940 --> 00:35:02,178
Prepare to be scared
beyond your imagination.

832
00:35:02,244 --> 00:35:03,511
[croaking]

833
00:35:03,578 --> 00:35:06,715
[intense music]

834
00:35:11,253 --> 00:35:13,488
No! You don't look scared!

835
00:35:13,555 --> 00:35:16,591
- Of a wizard parrot?
- I'm a wizard cockatoo!

836
00:35:16,658 --> 00:35:19,028
Oh, well, now I'm scared!

837
00:35:19,095 --> 00:35:20,463
[slurping]

838
00:35:20,528 --> 00:35:22,764
We are getting reports
of global unrest

839
00:35:22,831 --> 00:35:24,799
developing in the pet world

840
00:35:24,866 --> 00:35:27,802
as canines and felines
are suddenly quarreling

841
00:35:27,869 --> 00:35:29,405
at unprecedented levels.

842
00:35:29,472 --> 00:35:33,142
Just take a look at these videos
sent in from our local viewers.

843
00:35:33,209 --> 00:35:35,945
[growling]

844
00:35:36,012 --> 00:35:38,014
'Wow!'

845
00:35:38,080 --> 00:35:40,316
Glad you're not involved
in any of that mess.

846
00:35:40,383 --> 00:35:41,350
Right, Gwen?

847
00:35:41,417 --> 00:35:42,918
You have no idea.

848
00:35:42,985 --> 00:35:46,055
Zero, zero, one,
four, nine, three.

849
00:35:46,122 --> 00:35:48,757
'Yeah, a 2:00 p.m. showing,
okay?'

850
00:35:48,823 --> 00:35:50,993
'I can confirm you?
Alright, thank you.'

851
00:35:51,060 --> 00:35:53,595
'Okay, I look forward to it.
Bye-bye.'

852
00:35:54,897 --> 00:35:55,998
How did it go, champ?

853
00:35:56,065 --> 00:35:58,733
- Six-three, six-three.
- Wow.

854
00:35:58,800 --> 00:36:01,270
You put up quite a fight today.

855
00:36:01,337 --> 00:36:03,105
Still, a win's a win.

856
00:36:04,974 --> 00:36:07,143
Yeah, um..

857
00:36:07,209 --> 00:36:10,179
Actually, I lost.

858
00:36:11,514 --> 00:36:14,283
- You lost?
- That's right.

859
00:36:14,350 --> 00:36:16,718
Okay, uh..

860
00:36:16,785 --> 00:36:19,321
We can just train
a little harder next time.

861
00:36:19,388 --> 00:36:21,023
You know, we've been taking
Sunday mornings off

862
00:36:21,090 --> 00:36:23,259
from practice,
maybe that was a mistake.

863
00:36:23,325 --> 00:36:25,693
I don't know, mom, it's just..

864
00:36:25,760 --> 00:36:28,130
Maybe I wasn't
feeling it today.

865
00:36:29,365 --> 00:36:30,933
Well, no fever.

866
00:36:31,000 --> 00:36:33,768
Good news is,
the team actually won.

867
00:36:33,835 --> 00:36:36,805
The other guys pulled it for me,
so we're still undefeated.

868
00:36:36,871 --> 00:36:40,209
Hm, well, that's a..

869
00:36:40,276 --> 00:36:42,411
...silver lining I guess.

870
00:36:42,478 --> 00:36:44,280
[chuckles]

871
00:36:44,346 --> 00:36:46,982
While it's not uncommon
to see behavioral changes

872
00:36:47,049 --> 00:36:49,885
coincide with mating seasons
or even..

873
00:36:49,952 --> 00:36:52,455
...weather patterns,
but we've never seen

874
00:36:52,521 --> 00:36:53,989
anything like this.

875
00:36:54,056 --> 00:36:57,359
Now, we're speaking with the
manager of the Paw street market

876
00:36:57,426 --> 00:37:02,298
who's already seeing this
conflict impacting his business.

877
00:37:02,364 --> 00:37:04,200
People are skipping
the puppies and kittens

878
00:37:04,266 --> 00:37:07,069
'and taking home reptiles,
snakes and birds.'

879
00:37:07,136 --> 00:37:09,105
'All much easier to care for.'

880
00:37:09,171 --> 00:37:12,475
- What about the fish?
- Fish don't count.

881
00:37:12,541 --> 00:37:15,677
[instrumental music]

882
00:37:16,946 --> 00:37:19,482
Okay, come clean
about your field agent days.

883
00:37:19,548 --> 00:37:20,516
What happened out there?

884
00:37:20,583 --> 00:37:21,816
Look, it was a long time ago.

885
00:37:21,884 --> 00:37:23,818
I made a mistake, and ever since

886
00:37:23,886 --> 00:37:26,122
I've been behind a desk,
where I belong.

887
00:37:26,188 --> 00:37:27,722
What kind of mistake?

888
00:37:27,789 --> 00:37:30,459
There was a moment,
there's always a moment

889
00:37:30,526 --> 00:37:31,961
and I hesitated.

890
00:37:32,027 --> 00:37:35,431
My partner, my mentor got hurt.

891
00:37:35,498 --> 00:37:37,066
I've never gotten over it.

892
00:37:37,133 --> 00:37:40,702
But listen, we can't forget
that a pet's number one job

893
00:37:40,768 --> 00:37:42,804
is to be there for their humans.

894
00:37:42,871 --> 00:37:44,240
Okay, okay, you're right.

895
00:37:44,306 --> 00:37:47,176
And my boy Max just hasn't
been himself lately.

896
00:37:47,243 --> 00:37:48,810
I've been trying to help,
but he just

897
00:37:48,878 --> 00:37:50,045
he doesn't have time
for me anymore.

898
00:37:50,112 --> 00:37:51,947
Huh, well, my girl Zoey
has been going

899
00:37:52,014 --> 00:37:54,884
through some tough stuff too.
We might have to move.

900
00:37:54,950 --> 00:37:57,086
Max sure could use
someone to talk to.

901
00:37:57,153 --> 00:37:59,488
Preferably someone
who could talk back.

902
00:37:59,555 --> 00:38:02,024
Zoey doesn't have a friend
that understands her either.

903
00:38:02,091 --> 00:38:04,426
She just spends most of her time
on her phone.

904
00:38:04,493 --> 00:38:05,860
Huh, yeah, the phones.

905
00:38:05,928 --> 00:38:08,597
Max turns into a zombie
when he stares at his.

906
00:38:08,696 --> 00:38:10,399
Yeah, Zoey falls asleep
with hers

907
00:38:10,466 --> 00:38:11,799
on the pillow right next to her.

908
00:38:11,866 --> 00:38:13,502
You know, Max used to take me
to play fetch

909
00:38:13,569 --> 00:38:15,004
at the park every night.

910
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:17,173
Have humans forgotten
that their stress goes down

911
00:38:17,239 --> 00:38:19,008
when they engage
with their pets?

912
00:38:19,074 --> 00:38:21,076
These kids don't even engage
with each other.

913
00:38:21,143 --> 00:38:23,678
Max really needs
a friend like Zoey.

914
00:38:23,745 --> 00:38:26,415
Zoey really needs a friend
like Max.

915
00:38:26,482 --> 00:38:28,050
Meanwhile, a deranged villain

916
00:38:28,117 --> 00:38:30,352
is trying to eliminate
cats and dogs

917
00:38:30,419 --> 00:38:32,087
as human pets forever.

918
00:38:32,154 --> 00:38:33,721
And the only lead we have
depends

919
00:38:33,788 --> 00:38:36,091
on a shifty collection
of vile street cats

920
00:38:36,158 --> 00:38:39,228
who would trade their
grandmothers for a dead mouse.

921
00:38:39,295 --> 00:38:40,795
Why don't you let me
go talk to them?

922
00:38:40,862 --> 00:38:42,064
Are you sure you're ready?

923
00:38:42,131 --> 00:38:45,700
Are you kidding?
I was born ready!

924
00:38:45,767 --> 00:38:48,703

925
00:38:48,770 --> 00:38:51,907
[howling]

926
00:38:55,710 --> 00:38:58,380
- Shh!
- Sorry, it's, it's a dog thing.

927
00:38:58,447 --> 00:39:00,950
We like to sing along.

928
00:39:01,016 --> 00:39:04,587
(Gwen) 'A-actually, I change my mind.
I don't wanna do this.'

929
00:39:04,653 --> 00:39:06,355
Uh, rock, paper, scissors?

930
00:39:06,422 --> 00:39:07,456
Loser has to face 'em?

931
00:39:07,523 --> 00:39:10,426
You're on! One, two, three!

932
00:39:10,492 --> 00:39:12,528
I'm paper, you're rock. I win.

933
00:39:12,595 --> 00:39:14,196
No, I'm scissors. I win!

934
00:39:14,263 --> 00:39:16,699
That's not scissors.
How can that be scissors?

935
00:39:16,764 --> 00:39:18,167
That's totally scissors.

936
00:39:18,234 --> 00:39:19,401
If you're gonna throw out
scissors

937
00:39:19,468 --> 00:39:21,604
you've got to grow out
those nails.

938

939

941
00:39:28,143 --> 00:39:31,046
Remember,
you wanted some action.

942
00:39:31,113 --> 00:39:33,215
This is what
you've always wanted.

943
00:39:33,282 --> 00:39:37,052
Prepare yourself for some
disgusting frothing mongrels

944
00:39:37,119 --> 00:39:38,988
munching on dead mice.

945
00:39:39,054 --> 00:39:42,224
- Filth upon filth. Oh!
- 'Psst!'

946
00:39:42,291 --> 00:39:44,226
'Over here.'

947
00:39:46,462 --> 00:39:50,366
Elon Musk? I-I'm looking
for the alley cats?

948

949

(male #3)
'Then it's your lucky day.'

950
00:39:54,136 --> 00:39:55,770
You're an alley cat?

951
00:39:55,837 --> 00:39:58,540
(male #3) 'Why don't you
step into my office?'

952
00:39:58,607 --> 00:40:01,310
You mean, come into the light?

953
00:40:01,377 --> 00:40:04,179
I thought you guys
usually slept outside.

954
00:40:04,246 --> 00:40:06,982
Drank out of puddles,
ate dead mice.

955
00:40:07,049 --> 00:40:09,318
We did, until some rich doofus

956
00:40:09,385 --> 00:40:11,720
started parking his Tesla
in our alley

957
00:40:11,786 --> 00:40:13,922
and leaving the windows down.

958
00:40:13,989 --> 00:40:16,191
Well, I was told by a shaggy dog

959
00:40:16,258 --> 00:40:18,160
that you might have
information about a job

960
00:40:18,227 --> 00:40:19,962
that was done around here?

961
00:40:20,029 --> 00:40:23,032
Uh, keep it on the down-low
kinda job.

962
00:40:23,098 --> 00:40:26,834
Of course, I do.
I'm the one who did it.

963
00:40:26,902 --> 00:40:29,038
- You?
- That's right.

964
00:40:29,104 --> 00:40:32,775
And I was paid handsomely
for it.

965
00:40:32,840 --> 00:40:33,976
With money?

966
00:40:34,043 --> 00:40:36,345
No, what would a cat do
with money?

967
00:40:36,412 --> 00:40:39,948
I got this shiny ball
of tinfoil. Duh!

968
00:40:40,015 --> 00:40:43,952
Ooh! Ooh! Ooh! Fun! Ooh!

969
00:40:44,019 --> 00:40:45,688
[clears throat]
Who hired you?

970
00:40:45,754 --> 00:40:46,922
Don't know.

971
00:40:46,989 --> 00:40:49,191
They communicated
electronically.

972
00:40:49,258 --> 00:40:52,761
Sending text messages
about a covert mission.

973
00:40:52,827 --> 00:40:53,996
So, what was the mission?

974
00:40:54,063 --> 00:40:55,863
I snuck into the headquarters

975
00:40:55,931 --> 00:40:57,399
of a wireless phone company

976
00:40:57,466 --> 00:41:00,002
got some codes
off their computers.

977
00:41:00,069 --> 00:41:01,737
What kind of codes?

978
00:41:01,804 --> 00:41:04,006
Wi-Fi and cellular access codes.

979
00:41:04,073 --> 00:41:09,478
[laughs] Seems like a lot of trouble
just to get some free internet.

980
00:41:09,545 --> 00:41:11,846
Ooh!

981
00:41:11,914 --> 00:41:15,050
[clears throat]
It's just so shiny. Hm!

'Tell me you've made
some progress.'

986
00:41:25,761 --> 00:41:27,262
We've gathered some intel

987
00:41:27,329 --> 00:41:30,232
but I have no idea
how the pieces fit yet.

988
00:41:30,299 --> 00:41:33,535
Well, l-let's start with this.
What do we know?

989
00:41:33,602 --> 00:41:36,205
(Schnauzer on phone) 'Well,
we know some maniac out there'

990
00:41:36,271 --> 00:41:38,807
'has found a way
to ramp up aggression'

991
00:41:38,873 --> 00:41:40,776
'between cats and dogs.'

992
00:41:40,843 --> 00:41:42,878
And we know he shut down
our entire system

993
00:41:42,945 --> 00:41:45,214
designed to prevent such plots.

994
00:41:45,280 --> 00:41:47,216
And we know someone hired
the alley cats

995
00:41:47,282 --> 00:41:50,285
to steal access codes
for Wi-Fi and cell towers.

996
00:41:50,352 --> 00:41:52,955
And one thing has never made
sense to me.

997
00:41:53,021 --> 00:41:57,292
This plot is devastating
to both cats and dogs.

998
00:41:57,359 --> 00:41:59,661
What kind of lunatic
would device a plot

999
00:41:59,728 --> 00:42:01,296
that hurts all of us?

1000
00:42:01,363 --> 00:42:04,867
Well, hard to read the mind
of a lunatic.

1001
00:42:04,933 --> 00:42:06,668
Especially a cat lunatic.

1002
00:42:06,735 --> 00:42:08,504
Or a dog lunatic.

1003
00:42:08,570 --> 00:42:11,473
Maybe we need to think
outside the box.

1004
00:42:11,540 --> 00:42:14,476
No, what if it's neither
cat or dog lunatic?

1005
00:42:14,543 --> 00:42:16,278
Hm?

1006
00:42:16,345 --> 00:42:18,547
Who stands to gain
from humans walking away

1007
00:42:18,614 --> 00:42:20,082
from cats and dogs?

1008
00:42:20,149 --> 00:42:23,085
[gasps]
Other pets.

1009
00:42:23,152 --> 00:42:25,454
So we possibly have a rouge
secondary pet

1010
00:42:25,521 --> 00:42:27,756
who's bent on pushing
cats and dogs aside

1011
00:42:27,823 --> 00:42:29,258

But how can he possibly
be reaching

1015
00:42:36,565 --> 00:42:39,134
virtually every cat and dog
on the planet?

1016
00:42:39,201 --> 00:42:41,537
Through the food? Water?

1017
00:42:41,603 --> 00:42:43,705
Wait! That's it!

care about receiving internet

1019

00:45:18,027 --> 00:45:19,294
...you're in a little slump.

1068
00:45:19,361 --> 00:45:21,330
'It happens to everyone.'

1069
00:45:21,396 --> 00:45:24,633
We just have to decide
how to get you out of it.

1070
00:45:26,335 --> 00:45:29,471
Maybe a new racquet might help.

1071
00:45:29,538 --> 00:45:31,975
Huh?
Something with a bit more power?

1072
00:45:32,041 --> 00:45:35,410
[chuckles]
Wow. Uh, thanks, mom.

1073
00:45:35,477 --> 00:45:38,280
You know, we could, uh, re-watch
the Australian final

1074
00:45:38,347 --> 00:45:40,016
between Federer and Nadal.

1075
00:45:40,083 --> 00:45:41,717
'That always fires you up,
right?'

1076
00:45:41,783 --> 00:45:44,786
Hey, Rog, you like your
breakfast? That's a good boy!

1077
00:45:44,853 --> 00:45:46,990
You know, we could also
watch the video footage

1078
00:45:47,056 --> 00:45:49,791
of my over-40's club match
against Sheila Smithers

1079
00:45:49,858 --> 00:45:52,427
when I took her down
in straight sets.

1080
00:45:52,494 --> 00:45:54,329
- She was pregnant.
- Who knew?

1081
00:45:54,396 --> 00:45:56,899
- With triplets.
- Yeah, okay.

1082
00:45:56,966 --> 00:45:58,467
[laughing]

1083
00:45:58,533 --> 00:46:02,404
Listen, Max, you know I am
so very proud of you, right?

1084
00:46:02,471 --> 00:46:04,539
- No matter what.
- I know, mom.

1085
00:46:05,975 --> 00:46:09,778
- I'll figure it out.
- Okay. Eat up, champ.

1086
00:46:09,845 --> 00:46:12,781
[instrumental music]

1087
00:46:19,187 --> 00:46:22,557
Yeah, let me, uh, let me help
you with those, sweetie.

1088
00:46:22,624 --> 00:46:25,460
[groans]
After I..

1089
00:46:25,527 --> 00:46:26,996
After I take a break.

1090
00:46:27,063 --> 00:46:30,399
Dad, we can't move all of this
stuff to a smaller apartment.

1091
00:46:30,465 --> 00:46:32,834
- We need to make choices.
- You're right.

1092
00:46:32,902 --> 00:46:34,569
Okay, um..

1093
00:46:36,438 --> 00:46:38,074
- Trash or treasure?
- Treasure.

1094
00:46:38,141 --> 00:46:40,109
That's my high-school flannel.

1095
00:46:40,175 --> 00:46:42,310
- Alright.
- Treasure.

1096
00:46:42,377 --> 00:46:45,580
It's my college flannel.

1097
00:46:45,647 --> 00:46:48,316
Treasure, it's my unemployed
starving artist flannel.

1098
00:46:48,383 --> 00:46:50,987
I think we should treasure
the whole box.

1099
00:46:51,054 --> 00:46:53,355
We should treasure every moment,
actually label it

1100
00:46:53,422 --> 00:46:54,991
treasure. What else?

1101
00:46:55,058 --> 00:46:57,726
- What about these records?
- No! No, no, no!

1102
00:46:57,793 --> 00:47:00,429
We can't throw those out.
Are you kidding me?

1103
00:47:00,495 --> 00:47:02,932
Neil Young, Live Rust,
that like a..

1104
00:47:02,999 --> 00:47:05,168
...a rock and roll holy relic.

1105
00:47:05,233 --> 00:47:08,037
Psst! Psst!

1106
00:47:08,104 --> 00:47:09,172
[gasps]

1107
00:47:09,237 --> 00:47:10,973
Get over here!

1108
00:47:11,040 --> 00:47:12,674
Ah! You don't have to blind me!

1109
00:47:12,741 --> 00:47:16,712
Oh, here's a London band,
sort of little known.

1110
00:47:16,778 --> 00:47:19,481
I don't know,
the Rolling Stones.

1111
00:47:19,548 --> 00:47:21,683
'Okay, what's the shape
of this album?'

1112
00:47:21,750 --> 00:47:23,785
Octagon! What does that say?
Stop!

1113
00:47:23,852 --> 00:47:25,353
'That's what it means.'

1114
00:47:25,420 --> 00:47:27,890
Gotta keep these,
speakin' of which..

1115
00:47:27,957 --> 00:47:30,093
...where's your record
collection?

1116
00:47:30,159 --> 00:47:32,260
- Here.
- Are you crazy?

1117
00:47:32,327 --> 00:47:34,763
- They're both home!
- I think I have a fix.

1118
00:47:34,830 --> 00:47:39,267
Meet me in the hall.
Oh, and Zoey's phone, hide it!

1119
00:47:39,334 --> 00:47:41,303
- What?
- Just do it.

1120
00:47:41,369 --> 00:47:43,106
We're gonna give our humans
the friends

1121
00:47:43,172 --> 00:47:45,807
that we can't be right now.

1122
00:47:45,874 --> 00:47:48,810
[instrumental music]

1123
00:47:58,553 --> 00:48:00,022
[elevator bell dings]

1124
00:48:03,025 --> 00:48:04,359
[sighs]

1125
00:48:15,370 --> 00:48:18,273
[sighs]
Come on.

1126
00:48:18,340 --> 00:48:20,209
[music continues]

1127
00:48:20,275 --> 00:48:21,777
[sighs]

1128
00:48:28,151 --> 00:48:29,417
[elevator bell dings]

1129
00:48:33,722 --> 00:48:35,258
Uh, hey,
I left my phone upstairs.

1130
00:48:35,323 --> 00:48:37,392
Mind if we go back up
so I can grab it?

1131
00:48:37,459 --> 00:48:39,461
- Fine.
- Thanks.

1132
00:48:43,166 --> 00:48:46,035
I think I forgot mine, too.

1133
00:48:46,102 --> 00:48:47,435
[meows]

1134
00:48:51,740 --> 00:48:53,009
Thirsty?

1135
00:48:55,044 --> 00:48:56,411
Just gotta hydrate.

1136
00:48:56,478 --> 00:48:59,815
My mom likes me to get
at least 64 ounces before lunch.

1137
00:49:02,717 --> 00:49:04,553
What the..

1138
00:49:04,619 --> 00:49:07,223
[instrumental music]

1139
00:49:07,290 --> 00:49:08,824
- 'Hello! Somebody!'
- 'Hey!'

1140
00:49:08,891 --> 00:49:11,393
- 'Can you hear us? Hello!'
- 'Anybody out there? Hey!'

1141
00:49:12,261 --> 00:49:14,696
Hello!

1142
00:49:14,763 --> 00:49:16,966
Come on.

1143
00:49:17,033 --> 00:49:19,734
[sighs] I'm sure it's
just a minute or two.

1144
00:49:22,604 --> 00:49:23,738
What are the chances?

1145
00:49:23,805 --> 00:49:26,842
We both forgot our phones today.

1146
00:49:26,909 --> 00:49:29,011
I know. Great.

1147
00:49:29,078 --> 00:49:30,478
[sighs]

1148
00:49:37,652 --> 00:49:39,922
I don't even care if I miss
my tennis lesson this morning.

1149
00:49:39,989 --> 00:49:43,692
Really? I thought you, like,
ate, drank and breathe tennis

1150
00:49:43,758 --> 00:49:45,928
with every inch of your soul.

1151
00:49:45,995 --> 00:49:49,165
[chuckles]
Yeah, well, I thought I did too.

1152
00:49:49,232 --> 00:49:53,302
I mean, I even named my dog
Roger, after Federer.

1153
00:49:53,368 --> 00:49:55,403
I don't know,
recently, it's been feeling

1154
00:49:55,470 --> 00:49:57,539
more like a job than a hobby,
you know?

1155
00:49:57,606 --> 00:50:01,310
Dude, a bit of unsolicited
advice..

1156
00:50:01,376 --> 00:50:02,510
Hit me.

1157
00:50:02,577 --> 00:50:05,647
Chill, chill and chill!

1158
00:50:05,714 --> 00:50:07,382
Really? Even that last one?

1159
00:50:07,449 --> 00:50:09,285
Especially that last one.

1160
00:50:09,352 --> 00:50:10,685
[laughs]

1161
00:50:13,622 --> 00:50:15,390
So where were you off to
this morning?

1162
00:50:15,457 --> 00:50:17,226
Guitar lessons?

1163
00:50:17,293 --> 00:50:18,827
Um, no.

1164
00:50:18,895 --> 00:50:21,696
We're moving tomorrow
and we're packing boxes.

1165
00:50:21,763 --> 00:50:23,332
I just needed a break.

1166
00:50:23,431 --> 00:50:26,369
You're moving, like,
out of town?

1167
00:50:26,434 --> 00:50:30,106
No. We're just downsizing,
I guess.

1168
00:50:30,172 --> 00:50:33,608
Same school, new building
doesn't allow pets.

1169
00:50:33,675 --> 00:50:36,178
You, you have a cat, right?

1170
00:50:36,245 --> 00:50:38,680
Gwen, as in Stefani.

1171
00:50:38,747 --> 00:50:40,515
Music's kind of our thing.

1172
00:50:40,582 --> 00:50:42,584
Wasn't your dad a musician?

1173
00:50:42,651 --> 00:50:44,220
He is a musician.

1174
00:50:44,287 --> 00:50:46,821
[instrumental music]

1175
00:50:49,392 --> 00:50:50,825
How long do we leave 'em
in there?

1176
00:50:50,893 --> 00:50:53,495
Until they realize
they're actually friends.

1177
00:50:54,931 --> 00:50:56,631
[howling]

1178
00:50:57,766 --> 00:51:00,970
What? I told you
we like to sing along.

1179
00:51:01,037 --> 00:51:02,671
[brakes screech]

1180
00:51:04,273 --> 00:51:05,607
[brakes screech]

1181
00:51:09,678 --> 00:51:12,381
Notice anything weird
about that ice cream truck?

1182
00:51:12,447 --> 00:51:14,516
Uh, the terrible driving?

1183
00:51:14,582 --> 00:51:16,252
Yeah, and it never
actually stops.

1184
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:20,455
It's like, it's always there,
just watching us.

1185
00:51:20,522 --> 00:51:24,459
I'll go check it out and, uh,
hey, maybe grab a drumstick.

1186
00:51:27,595 --> 00:51:29,731
[panting]

1187
00:51:29,798 --> 00:51:32,667
Something's not right.
I've got a bad feeling.

1188
00:51:35,004 --> 00:51:36,405
- Whoa!
- Ed!

1189
00:51:36,471 --> 00:51:39,275
- Oh, no.
- Ed, no!

1190
00:51:39,342 --> 00:51:41,010
(Pablo)
'That was too easy.'

1191
00:51:41,077 --> 00:51:44,846
'Your smartest agent
just walked into my trap.'

1192
00:51:44,914 --> 00:51:45,915
Ed!

1193
00:51:45,982 --> 00:51:47,950
[Pablo laughing]

1194
00:51:48,017 --> 00:51:49,651
Ed! Ed!

1195
00:51:51,486 --> 00:51:53,956
(Pablo) 'Hah!
Good luck finding me now, bird brains.'

1196
00:51:54,023 --> 00:51:56,758
He has been watching us
this whole time.

1197
00:51:56,825 --> 00:51:58,793
Just, just playing with us.

1198
00:51:58,860 --> 00:52:00,829
We're in over our head
with this guy.

1199
00:52:00,896 --> 00:52:02,797
He's in complete command.

1200
00:52:02,864 --> 00:52:05,201
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Whoa!

1201
00:52:05,267 --> 00:52:06,701
Gas.

1202
00:52:06,768 --> 00:52:08,636
No, wait. Brakes!

1203
00:52:10,373 --> 00:52:11,941
Gas.

1204
00:52:12,008 --> 00:52:14,076
Brakes! Brakes!

1205
00:52:14,143 --> 00:52:16,078
Oh, no, a roundabout.

1206
00:52:17,712 --> 00:52:20,449
These things always confuse me.

1207
00:52:20,515 --> 00:52:24,320
Uh, maybe I should take over.

1208
00:52:24,387 --> 00:52:26,389
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa!
Okay. Okay.

1209
00:52:26,455 --> 00:52:28,257
Let me help.

1210
00:52:28,324 --> 00:52:30,859
(Pablo) 'Get back to the
pedals, lizard brain.'

1211
00:52:37,266 --> 00:52:38,300
[sighs]

1212
00:52:38,367 --> 00:52:39,601
[grunting]

1213
00:52:39,667 --> 00:52:41,636
- Anything?
- It's pitch black.

1214
00:52:41,703 --> 00:52:43,939
Wait, I got a,
I got a flash on my..

1215
00:52:44,006 --> 00:52:45,241
...phone.

1216
00:52:45,307 --> 00:52:47,309
It's great effort, but I think
it's time to come..

1217
00:52:47,376 --> 00:52:48,743
Whoa!

1218
00:52:49,544 --> 00:52:50,812
...down.

1219
00:52:50,880 --> 00:52:52,747
- Ow!
- Here, quick.

1220
00:52:55,184 --> 00:52:56,718
You okay?

1221
00:52:56,785 --> 00:52:58,787
Yeah, yeah, no, I'm fine. Fine.

1222
00:53:00,356 --> 00:53:01,689
[groans]

1223
00:53:20,543 --> 00:53:22,644
Um, zucchini kale bite?

1224

"No gluten, no dairy

1225
00:53:26,614 --> 00:53:28,716
no soy, no grains, no sugar."

1226
00:53:31,853 --> 00:53:33,788
And no taste.

1227
00:53:39,562 --> 00:53:41,729
[dramatic music]

1228
00:53:41,796 --> 00:53:45,000
- Uh-oh.
- What's "uh-oh?"

1229
00:53:45,067 --> 00:53:47,702
Oh, gosh, maybe you're a little
too hydrated?

1230
00:53:47,769 --> 00:53:49,604
You can never be too hydrated.

1231
00:53:50,973 --> 00:53:52,707
Unless you're stuck
in an elevator.

1232
00:53:52,774 --> 00:53:53,909
Well, you have to hold it.

1233
00:53:53,976 --> 00:53:56,445
I-I don't think I can.

1234
00:53:56,512 --> 00:53:58,080
Now we have a real emergency.

1235
00:53:59,415 --> 00:54:01,283
[exhales]

1236
00:54:01,350 --> 00:54:03,185
Uh! We lost him.

1237
00:54:03,252 --> 00:54:06,021
Wait. Maybe not.

1238
00:54:06,088 --> 00:54:08,756
[Ed howling]

1239
00:54:11,227 --> 00:54:13,761

01:03:25,313 --> 01:03:27,282
I think you'll enjoy
island life.

1418
01:03:27,349 --> 01:03:28,918
Island? What island?

1419
01:03:28,985 --> 01:03:31,319
Aldabra Island, Indian Ocean.

1420
01:03:31,386 --> 01:03:33,455
Sunshine, sandy beaches

1421
01:03:33,522 --> 01:03:35,424
crystal blue waters.

1422
01:03:35,490 --> 01:03:37,659
Hm. Sounds kinda nice.

1423
01:03:37,726 --> 01:03:40,562
And no humans!

1424
01:03:40,629 --> 01:03:41,830
[croaks]

1425
01:03:41,898 --> 01:03:43,298
[chuckles]

1426
01:03:43,365 --> 01:03:45,034
Whoa-oh.
Ho-hold on, hold on.

1427
01:03:45,101 --> 01:03:47,302
[stammers]
I-I don't get it.

1428
01:03:47,369 --> 01:03:49,204
We've done nothing to you.

1429
01:03:49,271 --> 01:03:51,506
Oh, but you have.

1430
01:03:51,573 --> 01:03:54,276
While you cats and dogs
were keeping the peace

1431
01:03:54,342 --> 01:03:57,279
with your worldwide FART system

1432
01:03:57,345 --> 01:03:59,581
rest of us pets sat

1433
01:03:59,648 --> 01:04:02,617
'day after day,
month after month'

1434
01:04:02,684 --> 01:04:06,788
and in my case,
year after year

1435
01:04:06,855 --> 01:04:09,058
waiting for human owners

1436
01:04:09,125 --> 01:04:10,193
that never came.

1437
01:04:10,258 --> 01:04:11,894
That's what this is about?

1438
01:04:11,961 --> 01:04:15,164
That's exactly
what this is about.

1439
01:04:15,230 --> 01:04:17,365
[alarm ringing]

1440
01:04:18,700 --> 01:04:20,435
(Max)
It says he's in here.

1441
01:04:20,502 --> 01:04:22,270
[panting]
Hey, what's going on?

1442
01:04:22,337 --> 01:04:24,406
Wait until they all clear.

1443
01:04:24,473 --> 01:04:26,775
Can't let you in.
Could be a fire in there.

1444
01:04:26,842 --> 01:04:28,978
In need to go inside.
My dog is in there.

1445
01:04:29,045 --> 01:04:30,479
No can do.

1446
01:04:33,916 --> 01:04:35,051
You said it yourself.

1447
01:04:35,118 --> 01:04:36,651
You've never been a pet.

1448
01:04:36,718 --> 01:04:38,587
So you don't know
what that bond is like.

1449
01:04:38,653 --> 01:04:40,622
I don't believe in that anymore.

1450
01:04:40,689 --> 01:04:42,691
And maybe you'll stop
believing, too.

1451
01:04:42,758 --> 01:04:44,326
'After yearning to be a pet'

1452
01:04:44,392 --> 01:04:46,495
'day after day
and year after year'

1453
01:04:46,561 --> 01:04:48,898
'on an island
where the only humans'

1454
01:04:48,965 --> 01:04:50,465
are skeletal remains

1455
01:04:50,532 --> 01:04:53,936
of long dead explorers.

1456
01:04:54,003 --> 01:04:55,104
Close up the crates!

1457
01:04:55,171 --> 01:04:57,405
So we can bid a fond farewell

1458
01:04:57,472 --> 01:05:02,211
to the failed cats and dogs
of Zone 867.

1459
01:05:02,277 --> 01:05:03,645
[alarm ringing]

1460
01:05:05,614 --> 01:05:08,550
Hey, I said don't go
in there, you rebels.

1461
01:05:09,518 --> 01:05:11,319
Uh, they'll be fine.

1462
01:05:11,386 --> 01:05:13,321
We've got company.

1463
01:05:16,792 --> 01:05:19,061
- That's Max.
- And Zoe.

1464
01:05:20,796 --> 01:05:22,231
(Roger)
'They tracked my GPS collar.'

1465
01:05:22,297 --> 01:05:24,666
Max must've noticed I was gone.

1466
01:05:24,733 --> 01:05:27,036
He still does care about me.

1467
01:05:27,103 --> 01:05:28,770
Stop him, girls.

1468
01:05:28,837 --> 01:05:29,805
[hissing]

1469

01:05:34,309 --> 01:05:35,912
- Roger!
- Rog!

1472
01:05:35,978 --> 01:05:37,646
Roger!

1473
01:05:37,712 --> 01:05:39,748
Humans are gonna save us.

1474
01:05:41,416 --> 01:05:42,885
Get rid of the humans!

1475
01:05:42,952 --> 01:05:45,754
[laughs]
I'll do better than that.

1476
01:05:46,755 --> 01:05:49,658
I did some late night research

1477
01:05:49,724 --> 01:05:52,295
that revealed frequencies

1478
01:05:52,360 --> 01:05:54,696
impacting the human brain.

1479
01:05:56,933 --> 01:05:58,067

[screaming]

1481
01:05:59,534 --> 01:06:01,304
Geez! What is that?

1482
01:06:01,369 --> 01:06:02,972
[all screaming]

1483
01:06:04,840 --> 01:06:05,942

1485
01:06:10,846 --> 01:06:12,081

[groaning]

1487
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:16,484
- Stop it.
- You're hurting them.

[hissing]

1489
01:06:20,589 --> 01:06:22,091
Close up the crates!

1490
01:06:26,494 --> 01:06:28,030
Well, my work here is done.

1491
01:06:28,097 --> 01:06:31,234
So I'm gonna make
like a bulldog and flee.

1492
01:06:31,300 --> 01:06:33,835
Flee. Get it? Flee?

1493

[croaks]

1494
01:06:35,437 --> 01:06:37,372
Anyway, you all
have a nice trip.

1495
01:06:37,439 --> 01:06:40,109
Zeek, bring me
my iron dog suit.

1496
01:06:44,881 --> 01:06:46,082
[laughs]

1497
01:06:50,286 --> 01:06:52,454
[Roger grunting]

1498
01:06:54,456 --> 01:06:57,492
- What now?
- 'No one hurts my human.'

1499
01:07:00,263 --> 01:07:03,132
Oh, my head. Ah! My head.

1500
01:07:03,199 --> 01:07:04,833
I just need a minute.

1501
01:07:06,202 --> 01:07:08,470

1504
01:07:11,007 --> 01:07:12,975
'I'd run through a brick wall
for her.'

1505
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:16,212
'Ow! Oh! Ow! Oh!'

1506
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:17,712
'Ooh! Ow!'

1507
01:07:17,779 --> 01:07:19,916
'Why couldn't you've locked us
in a paper sack?'

1508
01:07:19,982 --> 01:07:22,084
Didn't want you
to get a paper cut.

1509

[crashing]

1510
01:07:25,420 --> 01:07:28,024
Nobody hurts my friends' humans.

1511
01:07:31,726 --> 01:07:34,263
- Thanks, big guy.
- Yeah, I got your back, kid.

1512
01:07:34,330 --> 01:07:36,065
This is so annoying.

01:07:42,939 --> 01:07:44,974
You really care about them
that much?

1516
01:07:45,041 --> 01:07:47,776
We would do anything for them.
That's what pets do.

1517
01:07:47,842 --> 01:07:50,445
Just like they would do
anything for us.

1518
01:07:52,415 --> 01:07:53,815
Ow!

1519
01:07:56,785 --> 01:07:58,054
Ow.

[mellow music]

1521
01:08:15,603 --> 01:08:16,906
Hello.

[panting]

1523
01:08:23,645 --> 01:08:25,982
Yeah. Okay.

1524
01:08:28,483 --> 01:08:31,320
Uh, what is this thing
I'm feelin'?

1525
01:08:31,387 --> 01:08:34,457
It's so... strange.

1526
01:08:34,522 --> 01:08:36,158
It's called affection.

1527
01:08:36,225 --> 01:08:38,560
It's what people do
for the pets they love.

1528
01:08:38,626 --> 01:08:40,062
You're a cool bird.

1529
01:08:40,129 --> 01:08:43,265
I'm, I'm enjoyin' it.

1530
01:08:43,332 --> 01:08:45,434
Enough of this!

1531
01:08:45,533 --> 01:08:46,969
Want me to turn up the frequency

1532
01:08:47,036 --> 01:08:49,738
and get that clingy,
foolish bugs off you?

1533
01:08:49,804 --> 01:08:53,376
No, turn it off! Let them go!

1534
01:08:53,442 --> 01:08:54,743
I'm a changed bird.

1535
01:08:54,809 --> 01:08:58,047
I-I've seen the light
at the end of the cage.

1536
01:08:58,114 --> 01:08:59,448
- What?
- What?

1537
01:08:59,514 --> 01:09:04,552
By the way, animals talkin',
our little secret, okay?

1538
01:09:04,619 --> 01:09:06,721
I got you, super bird.

1539
01:09:09,191 --> 01:09:10,859
Super bird? Oh..

1540
01:09:10,926 --> 01:09:15,331
I didn't study code
every night for two years

1541
01:09:15,398 --> 01:09:18,200
to watch you go soft on me.

1542
01:09:18,267 --> 01:09:20,136
That was not the plan.

1543
01:09:20,202 --> 01:09:22,938
Yeah, well, you didn't
make the plan.

1544
01:09:23,005 --> 01:09:24,606
I did.

1545
01:09:24,672 --> 01:09:26,641
I have a new purpose now.

1546
01:09:26,708 --> 01:09:30,346
Everyone should feel
the love of a human.

1547
01:09:30,413 --> 01:09:33,516
You're not going anywhere.

What are you doing? It's over.

1551
01:09:42,925 --> 01:09:46,594
So hand me the phone and get
ready for your new family.

1552
01:09:46,661 --> 01:09:48,763
I don't want a family.

1553
01:09:48,830 --> 01:09:52,368
And I don't wanna be trapped
in a tiny space

1554
01:09:52,435 --> 01:09:54,869
being force-fed crickets.

1555
01:09:54,937 --> 01:09:57,073
Okay, well, then
what do you want?

1556
01:09:57,139 --> 01:09:58,673
I want it all.

Before cats, before anyone!

1560
01:10:08,616 --> 01:10:10,352
Not before fish!

Fish don't count.

It's time my reptilian brothers
and I once again

take our place at the top
of the food chain!

1564
01:10:20,695 --> 01:10:22,797
The top? That would mean that...

1565
01:10:22,864 --> 01:10:25,633
- Exactly!
- Zeek.

1566
01:10:25,700 --> 01:10:27,169
I order you to stop.

No, you won't make it.

1572
01:10:40,782 --> 01:10:43,452
There's always a moment

1573
01:10:43,519 --> 01:10:46,355
and this is that moment.

1574
01:10:46,422 --> 01:10:48,090
Cover me, partner.

1575
01:10:48,157 --> 01:10:49,892
Did you just call me partner?
