00:09:35,742 --> 00:09:38,077
I could have helped her.

183
00:09:38,078 --> 00:09:40,329
- Honey, I don't know.

184
00:09:40,330 --> 00:09:45,626
Because she's too sweet a spirit
to be on this earth, because she

185
00:09:45,627 --> 00:09:49,463
has more important
things to do in heaven.

186
00:09:49,464 --> 00:09:51,590
- Is that what you think?

187
00:09:51,591 --> 00:09:57,763
That god wanted our
daughter to die?

188
00:09:57,764 --> 00:10:03,477
- I don't know why.

189
00:10:03,478 --> 00:10:05,146
I just have to believe that
there's a reason or

190
00:10:05,147 --> 00:10:13,147
I can't move on.

191
00:10:13,363 --> 00:10:17,241
- I miss her so much.

192
00:10:17,242 --> 00:10:20,453
No.

193
00:10:20,454 --> 00:10:28,454
I just need to be
left alone right now.

194
00:10:47,439 --> 00:10:49,899
- Honey, Julie and I can
help you pack up

195
00:10:49,900 --> 00:10:53,277
Elizabeth's things.

196
00:10:53,278 --> 00:10:56,072
I think it's time.

197
00:10:56,073 --> 00:10:58,157
- I can't do that.

198
00:10:58,158 --> 00:11:02,119
- We can do it for you.

199
00:11:02,120 --> 00:11:05,790
- I'm not ready, mom.

200
00:11:05,791 --> 00:11:07,833
- We just want to help.

201
00:11:07,834 --> 00:11:11,962
- And I appreciate that, okay.

202
00:11:11,963 --> 00:11:18,719
I'm... I'm just not ready.

203
00:11:18,720 --> 00:11:26,602
I need everything to
be the way it is, okay?

204
00:11:26,603 --> 00:11:28,896
Even when everything's
packed up, it will still be

205
00:11:28,897 --> 00:11:31,774
Elizabeth's room.

206
00:11:31,775 --> 00:11:37,154
And when I'm ready,
Steve will help me.

207
00:11:37,155 --> 00:11:40,074
- Maybe you need to do
something to help you heal.

208
00:11:40,075 --> 00:11:42,535
There's a lot of volunteer
programs out there.

209
00:11:42,536 --> 00:11:44,578
- You're probably right.

210
00:11:44,579 --> 00:11:47,581
I'll look into it, okay?

211
00:11:47,582 --> 00:11:50,042
- We're always here
for you, sweetheart.

212
00:11:50,043 --> 00:11:51,669
We love you so much.

213
00:11:51,670 --> 00:11:54,463
[Thunder crashing]

214
00:11:54,464 --> 00:11:57,258
- One of the hardest pills to
swallow is that life has to go

215
00:11:57,259 --> 00:11:59,844
on with or without you.

216
00:11:59,845 --> 00:12:02,346
People are so kind and
attentive at first, but pretty

217
00:12:02,347 --> 00:12:06,058
soon they have to attend
to their own lives.

218
00:12:06,059 --> 00:12:09,895
It leaves you feeling
very alone at times.

219
00:12:09,896 --> 00:12:12,231
Steve has thrown
himself into his work.

220
00:12:12,232 --> 00:12:14,692
I decided to take
my sister's advice.

221
00:12:14,693 --> 00:12:16,569
I've been volunteering at
a local homeless shelter.

222
00:12:16,570 --> 00:12:19,488
- Read 'em and weep.
Read 'em and weep.

223
00:12:19,489 --> 00:12:21,699
Four aces. Four aces.

224
00:12:21,700 --> 00:12:23,075
You need to pay up, buddy.

225
00:12:23,076 --> 00:12:24,952
Read 'em. Now weep.

226
00:12:24,953 --> 00:12:25,995
What do you mean
you're not interested?

227
00:12:25,996 --> 00:12:26,663
- Hi, frank.

228
00:12:26,664 --> 00:12:27,913
How are you?

229
00:12:27,914 --> 00:12:31,083
- I'm good considering
I'm in a war zone.

230
00:12:31,084 --> 00:12:33,502
This guy here, he won't
fork over my cash.

231
00:12:33,503 --> 00:12:34,628
- What's his name?

232
00:12:34,629 --> 00:12:35,589
I get them all confused.

233
00:12:35,590 --> 00:12:37,131
- Never mind.

234
00:12:37,132 --> 00:12:39,800
Wow, you sure look
great in your uniform.

235
00:12:39,801 --> 00:12:41,135
- Oh thanks, frank.

236
00:12:41,136 --> 00:12:43,262
- You're sure a sight
for these tired old eyes.

237
00:12:43,263 --> 00:12:44,513
- Thank you.

238
00:12:44,514 --> 00:12:45,723
Will you watch my car?

239
00:12:45,724 --> 00:12:46,600
- Absolutely.

240
00:12:46,600 --> 00:12:47,434
I'll take care of it.

241
00:12:47,434 --> 00:12:48,226
Nothing will happen to it.

242
00:12:48,227 --> 00:12:49,435
- Okay.

243
00:12:49,436 --> 00:12:50,895
- You're safe.

244
00:12:50,896 --> 00:12:51,730
Dinner's on us.

245
00:12:51,731 --> 00:12:52,980
Dinner's on us.

246
00:12:52,981 --> 00:12:55,316
You guys have been
wonderful today.

247
00:12:55,317 --> 00:13:03,317
[Music]

248
00:13:26,681 --> 00:13:29,475
- Lady, you got a problem?

249
00:13:29,476 --> 00:13:31,060
- No. No. Sorry.

250
00:13:31,061 --> 00:13:34,438
I just thought I
saw somebody I knew.

251
00:13:34,439 --> 00:13:35,564
- Well, it's just us here,
and if you don't mind, we'd

252
00:13:35,565 --> 00:13:37,900
like to be left alone.

253
00:13:37,901 --> 00:13:38,735
- My name's Laura.

254
00:13:38,736 --> 00:13:40,444
I work here at the shelter.

255
00:13:40,445 --> 00:13:42,112
Are you guys hungry?

256
00:13:42,113 --> 00:13:45,574
- We're always hungry.

257
00:13:45,575 --> 00:13:47,952
- How about some
food and warm clothes?

258
00:13:47,953 --> 00:13:49,537
- What's the catch?

259
00:13:49,538 --> 00:13:50,621
- No catch.

260
00:13:50,622 --> 00:13:55,125
Just food and warm
clothes to start.

261
00:13:55,126 --> 00:13:57,503
- Well, that would
be real nice, lady.

262
00:13:57,504 --> 00:14:01,799
Me and punkin haven't
eaten in a couple of days.

263
00:14:01,800 --> 00:14:04,301
You okay, lady?

264
00:14:04,302 --> 00:14:05,719
- Yeah.

265
00:14:05,720 --> 00:14:06,804
Yeah.

266
00:14:06,805 --> 00:14:09,932
Um, what was your name?

267
00:14:09,933 --> 00:14:12,935
- Tilly.

268
00:14:12,936 --> 00:14:17,731
- Is her real name punkin?

269
00:14:17,732 --> 00:14:18,567
- I don't know her real name.

270
00:14:18,568 --> 00:14:20,985
She don't talk much.

271
00:14:20,986 --> 00:14:22,361
Where is this warm meal
you're talking about?

272
00:14:22,362 --> 00:14:27,533
- Follow me.

273
00:14:27,534 --> 00:14:28,285
- Hey, Lionel.

274
00:14:28,286 --> 00:14:29,702
- Oh, hi.

275
00:14:29,703 --> 00:14:30,953
- I just wanted to say thanks
for helping out

276
00:14:30,954 --> 00:14:32,121
with the girls.

277
00:14:32,122 --> 00:14:34,290
- Oh, that's what I'm here for.

278
00:14:34,291 --> 00:14:36,292
I'll make sure they have a
room for the night away from

279
00:14:36,293 --> 00:14:38,711
the others so that
they'll be safe.

280
00:14:38,712 --> 00:14:40,879
But Laura, we've gotta call
social services soon to

281
00:14:40,880 --> 00:14:42,006
protect my license.

282
00:14:42,007 --> 00:14:43,632
- I know.

283
00:14:43,633 --> 00:14:45,009
But I was thinking we could
hold out on that for a little

284
00:14:45,010 --> 00:14:47,928
bit until I find out why
they're on the streets.

285
00:14:47,929 --> 00:14:50,889
I think that Tilly had a bad
experience in foster care.

286
00:14:50,890 --> 00:14:52,933
- All right.

287
00:14:52,934 --> 00:14:54,977
I'll follow your
lead on this one.

288
00:14:54,978 --> 00:14:56,145
- You're a godsend.

289
00:14:56,146 --> 00:14:57,563
- But keep me posted.

290
00:14:57,564 --> 00:15:05,564
- Okay. Thanks!

291
00:15:05,989 --> 00:15:07,323
- Something happened to me
today, and I know it may sound

292
00:15:07,324 --> 00:15:10,576
crazy, but I don't even know
if I believe it myself.

293
00:15:10,577 --> 00:15:12,328
- Will you just tell me.

294
00:15:12,329 --> 00:15:13,329
- Okay.

295
00:15:13,330 --> 00:15:14,205
You know how I volunteer at
the homeless

296
00:15:14,206 --> 00:15:15,331
shelter every Wednesday?

297
00:15:15,332 --> 00:15:16,915
- Yes.

298
00:15:16,916 --> 00:15:18,834
- And I pay that frank
guy to watch my car.

299
00:15:18,835 --> 00:15:20,794
- Yes, I know.

300
00:15:20,795 --> 00:15:24,840
- Well, the most beautiful
but strange thing happened to

301
00:15:24,841 --> 00:15:30,012
me when I walked in
those shelter doors.

302
00:15:30,013 --> 00:15:35,768
I saw Elizabeth, Steve.

303
00:15:35,769 --> 00:15:37,561
- What do you mean
you saw Elizabeth?

304
00:15:37,562 --> 00:15:41,815
- I mean I felt this warm
breeze all around me, and I

305
00:15:41,816 --> 00:15:49,816
looked up, and she
was right there.

306
00:15:50,533 --> 00:15:53,702
- What are you doing, Laura?

307
00:15:53,703 --> 00:15:54,621
You don't need to make up
stories to make

308
00:15:54,622 --> 00:15:56,205
me feel better.

309
00:15:56,206 --> 00:15:59,625
- I'm telling you the truth!

310
00:15:59,626 --> 00:16:03,420
Why would I make up stories
about seeing our daughter?

311
00:16:03,421 --> 00:16:05,089
I followed her into the alley
where I saw two

312
00:16:05,090 --> 00:16:08,008
homeless girls.

313
00:16:08,009 --> 00:16:13,097
They looked like they hadn't
eaten in a really long time.

314
00:16:13,098 --> 00:16:14,264
- Wow.

315
00:16:14,265 --> 00:16:17,226
Boy, that's truly amazing.

316
00:16:17,227 --> 00:16:18,435
- I know.

317
00:16:18,436 --> 00:16:20,396
And I could tell that
Elizabeth wanted me to help

318
00:16:20,397 --> 00:16:23,399
them, so I took them inside
and I got them

319
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:26,777
something to eat.

320
00:16:26,778 --> 00:16:28,570
- What's a little girl
doing on the street anyways?

321
00:16:28,571 --> 00:16:32,950
- I don't know.

322
00:16:32,951 --> 00:16:37,538
I asked Tilly, and she just
said she showed up on the

323
00:16:37,539 --> 00:16:40,749
streets one day.

324
00:16:40,750 --> 00:16:41,917
You know what?

325
00:16:41,918 --> 00:16:47,631
That little girl,
they call her punkin.

326
00:16:47,632 --> 00:16:51,927
Just like you used to
call our Elizabeth.

327
00:16:51,928 --> 00:16:54,722
- Punkin, huh?

328
00:16:54,723 --> 00:17:02,723
- Yeah. Punkin.

329
00:17:04,941 --> 00:17:06,108
- What's wrong with you?

330
00:17:06,109 --> 00:17:10,612
- What's wrong with me?

331
00:17:10,613 --> 00:17:14,908
I miss my little girl.

332
00:17:14,909 --> 00:17:17,161
And here you are making
up stories about seeing

333
00:17:17,162 --> 00:17:20,622
Elizabeth's spirit.

334
00:17:20,623 --> 00:17:22,499
Another little
girl's called punkin.

335
00:17:22,500 --> 00:17:24,501
- I'm telling you the truth!

336
00:17:24,502 --> 00:17:28,088
I saw our daughter today.

337
00:17:28,089 --> 00:17:31,258
- I see her everywhere I go.

338
00:17:31,259 --> 00:17:37,097
The backyard playing, at the
playground, the grocery store.

339
00:17:37,098 --> 00:17:40,309
Her memories haunt me, Laura.

340
00:17:40,310 --> 00:17:42,603
But it's not her, okay?

341
00:17:42,604 --> 00:17:43,729
So stop it!

342
00:17:43,730 --> 00:17:45,105
She is dead!

343
00:17:45,106 --> 00:17:46,732
Our little girl is dead.

344
00:17:46,733 --> 00:17:48,776
And the sooner you can accept
that fact the sooner we can

345
00:17:48,777 --> 00:17:56,777
both move on!

346
00:17:59,621 --> 00:18:07,621
The only thing I see is a long
road of grief ahead of me.

347
00:18:09,672 --> 00:18:17,672
I don't want to hear anymore
stories about ghosts.

348
00:18:35,031 --> 00:18:38,200
- I'm sorry.

349
00:18:38,201 --> 00:18:41,954
- It's okay.

350
00:18:41,955 --> 00:18:45,541
I'm just probably seeing
something, right?

351
00:18:45,542 --> 00:18:53,542
Wishful thinking?

352
00:18:53,550 --> 00:18:57,594
- There's no book on how to
survive the death of a child,

353
00:18:57,595 --> 00:19:01,890
Laura.

354
00:19:01,891 --> 00:19:08,856
We're both doing the
best we know how.

355
00:19:08,857 --> 00:19:12,442
- I just don't want
to lose you too.

356
00:19:12,443 --> 00:19:15,737
- Hey.

357
00:19:15,738 --> 00:19:23,738
You won't.

358
00:19:39,804 --> 00:19:40,763
- Hey, frank.

359
00:19:40,764 --> 00:19:41,889
- Hey, Laura.

360
00:19:41,890 --> 00:19:43,599
Hey, don't worry
about your vehicle.

361
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,934
Chief pinky is out there, and
he's watching it while

00:19:45,935 --> 00:19:46,935
we're eating chow.

363
00:19:46,936 --> 00:19:49,021
- Okay, thanks.

364
00:19:49,022 --> 00:19:50,856
I brought two girls in here
the other day named

00:19:50,857 --> 00:19:52,691
punkin and Tilly.

366
00:19:52,692 --> 00:19:54,234
I can't seem to
find them anywhere.

Have you seen them?

368
00:19:56,029 --> 00:19:57,654
- Well, they didn't
stay very long.

369
00:19:57,655 --> 00:20:00,699
They were assigned a
special ops mission.

370
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:04,620
They left the next day under
the cover of darkness.

371
00:20:04,621 --> 00:20:12,621
You okay?

372
00:20:13,004 --> 00:20:15,380
I'm really worried about her.

373
00:20:15,381 --> 00:20:18,884
She's starting to show
signs of battle fatigue.

374
00:20:18,885 --> 00:20:19,927
- She'll be fine.

375
00:20:19,928 --> 00:20:21,970
She's just working
through losing her kid.

What's your hurry?

382
00:20:46,288 --> 00:20:47,454
We're just talking to the girl.

383
00:20:47,455 --> 00:20:48,914
- Get your hands off of me.

384
00:20:48,915 --> 00:20:50,290
My husband's a cop.

385
00:20:50,291 --> 00:20:51,541
- I don't care
about no 5... 0.

386
00:20:51,542 --> 00:20:52,793
We're taking this little girl,
and we'll be on our way.

387
00:20:52,794 --> 00:20:55,212
- You're not gonna touch her!

388
00:20:55,213 --> 00:20:57,464
And you're gonna
leave these two alone.

389
00:20:57,465 --> 00:20:58,966
Or I'll have the cops hunt you
down so fast, your

Remember that.

Hey, let's bounce.

395
00:21:07,642 --> 00:21:09,059
She ain't worth it.

- Thanks, lady.

398
00:21:17,902 --> 00:21:19,444
They wanted punkin.

I don't know why.

400
00:21:20,989 --> 00:21:21,906
- It won't happen again.

Not on my watch.

00:21:29,205 --> 00:21:32,916
- What are you two gawking at?

403
00:21:32,917 --> 00:21:34,251
- Nothing.

Let's get you some
food. Come on.

405
00:21:45,221 --> 00:21:46,847
- I don't see the girl, man.

406

nosy broad came out of no

husband was a cop.

trying to catch no kidnapping

411
00:21:54,439 --> 00:21:56,148
- No girl, no bill.

412
00:21:56,149 --> 00:21:57,941
You're paying full price.

413
00:21:57,942 --> 00:22:03,780
- Let's see it first.

414
00:22:03,781 --> 00:22:11,781
- Show me some cash.

415

What's wrong?

- Trust me, you
don't want to know.

I'll shut up. Go ahead.

- It's like she wants me to
help save this little girl.

429
00:23:12,475 --> 00:23:15,560
I was at the homeless shelter
today, and I look up, and

430
00:23:15,561 --> 00:23:18,939
she's standing right there.

431
00:23:18,940 --> 00:23:22,984
I tried to go over to her, and
she led me straight to punkin.

432
00:23:22,985 --> 00:23:25,195
There were some gang members
outside harassing her, so I

433
00:23:25,196 --> 00:23:26,114
asked them to leave.

434
00:23:26,114 --> 00:23:27,073
- Wait a minute.

What do you mean gang members?

00:23:28,282 --> 00:23:31,118
- Like, real gang members.

437
00:23:31,119 --> 00:23:35,372
One of them had a cross
taboo right here on his arm.

438
00:23:35,373 --> 00:23:37,207
- That's the gang we've
been investigating.

439
00:23:37,208 --> 00:23:38,500
They're getting weapons.

440
00:23:38,501 --> 00:23:40,001
We have no idea where
they're coming from.

441
00:23:40,002 --> 00:23:42,712
I told you, I don't like
you going down there.

Can't you find something
else to keep you busy?

I mean, don't you get it?

me to help punkin.

- Laura, I know you have a
big heart, but you have no

idea what you're getting into
here, what a kid from the

00:23:59,772 --> 00:24:04,484
street can be like, how
emotionally damaged they are.

449

Why don't we take her
to social services.

450
00:24:05,987 --> 00:24:07,696
I can make sure she
gets into a good home.

451
00:24:07,697 --> 00:24:09,948
- I don't think
that's the right move.

452
00:24:09,949 --> 00:24:13,660
She's just really scared.

453
00:24:13,661 --> 00:24:17,998
All I know is that Elizabeth
keeps appearing to me and

454
00:24:17,999 --> 00:24:25,999
leading me straight to punkin.

- How you doing?

- I'm okay, but I think
I have trench foot.

463
00:24:39,812 --> 00:24:41,522
But I should be
asking how are you?

- I'm good.
Why do you ask?

465

- Well, I'm worried.

I think our parameter in sect
"a" might have a breach in it.

But more importantly,
I'm worried about you.

I think you're seeing
people who aren't there.

- Yeah, well, so do you.

to because I'm crazy.

It's my daughter.

00:24:59,207 --> 00:25:00,248
It's her spirit.

sort of standard operational

00:26:54,363 --> 00:26:55,530
I'm sorry, miss Laura.

539
00:26:55,531 --> 00:26:57,115
I'm not real good at this.

540
00:26:57,116 --> 00:26:59,284
Punkin's not used to having
people care about her.

541
00:26:59,285 --> 00:27:01,286
- Well, I care about you too.

542
00:27:01,287 --> 00:27:03,663
How did you end up on
the streets, Tilly?

543
00:27:03,664 --> 00:27:05,373
- Some bad stuff happened to
me in foster care, that's how.

544
00:27:05,374 --> 00:27:08,168
I ain't going back.

545
00:27:08,169 --> 00:27:10,503
- How do you know punkin?

546
00:27:10,504 --> 00:27:13,548
- She showed up a few weeks
ago and took a liking to me.

547
00:27:13,549 --> 00:27:14,425
She doesn't say a word.

548
00:27:14,426 --> 00:27:15,592
I don't know where
she came from.

549
00:27:15,593 --> 00:27:17,177
- Well, you shouldn't
be here on the streets.

550
00:27:17,178 --> 00:27:20,889
You have other options other
than foster care, okay?

551
00:27:20,890 --> 00:27:24,434
I'm gonna give you
my husband's card.

552
00:27:24,435 --> 00:27:26,019
His name's Steve.

553
00:27:26,020 --> 00:27:28,271
He knows this terrific place
that can help you find a job

554
00:27:28,272 --> 00:27:31,941
and help you learn how to
take care of yourself, okay?

555
00:27:31,942 --> 00:27:35,570
- What's gonna happen to punkin?

556
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:38,239
- I think I've got an idea.

557
00:27:38,240 --> 00:27:39,449
- Thanks, miss Laura.

558
00:27:39,450 --> 00:27:40,867
You must be an angel.

559
00:27:40,868 --> 00:27:42,035
That's it.

560
00:27:42,036 --> 00:27:43,495
You're my guardian angel.

561
00:27:43,496 --> 00:27:46,247
- Everyone needs
one, right honey?

562
00:27:46,248 --> 00:27:48,750
- Mary Jane, is that you?

563
00:27:48,751 --> 00:27:50,919
- Do you know this little girl?

564
00:27:50,920 --> 00:27:52,087
- And you are?

565
00:27:52,088 --> 00:27:53,088
- I'm Laura.

566
00:27:53,089 --> 00:27:54,214
I work here at the shelter.

567
00:27:54,215 --> 00:27:57,425
- My name is Devine and
I used to know... I mean.

568
00:27:57,426 --> 00:27:58,968
- You used to know who?

569
00:27:58,969 --> 00:28:00,887
- I didn't say nothin'.

570
00:28:00,888 --> 00:28:02,555
- Well, can you help me?

571
00:28:02,556 --> 00:28:07,352
- I don't know nothin'.

572
00:28:07,353 --> 00:28:15,353
[Whispering]

573
00:28:19,073 --> 00:28:20,698
- She sees dead people.

574
00:28:20,699 --> 00:28:23,159
People not even in the war.

575
00:28:23,160 --> 00:28:24,702
- What are you talking about?

576
00:28:24,703 --> 00:28:26,704
- You know, like in that movie?

577
00:28:26,705 --> 00:28:28,373
She told me so one night when
we were on the

578
00:28:28,374 --> 00:28:31,251
front lines patrolling.

579
00:28:31,252 --> 00:28:32,919
- Frank, honey, I love you
but everyone on the street

580
00:28:32,920 --> 00:28:34,504
knows you're crazy.

581
00:28:34,505 --> 00:28:38,091
Gotta go!

582
00:28:38,092 --> 00:28:40,844
- People I see are real!

583
00:28:40,845 --> 00:28:43,388
At least I think so.

584
00:28:43,389 --> 00:28:44,597
- Hey, coming?

585
00:28:44,598 --> 00:28:52,598
Come on!

586
00:29:00,823 --> 00:29:04,200
- Hi.
- Hi.

587
00:29:04,201 --> 00:29:07,704
- I have a huge
favor to ask you.

588
00:29:07,705 --> 00:29:10,957
- Okay. What is it?

589
00:29:10,958 --> 00:29:12,333
- I would love if you can
look into punkin's

590
00:29:12,334 --> 00:29:14,836
background for me.

591
00:29:14,837 --> 00:29:16,838
See maybe if she has any
family or why she's

592
00:29:16,839 --> 00:29:19,048
on the streets.

593
00:29:19,049 --> 00:29:19,758
I want to help her.

594
00:29:19,759 --> 00:29:24,262
I need to help her.

595
00:29:24,263 --> 00:29:28,641
Please?

596
00:29:28,642 --> 00:29:30,268
- I'll see what I can do.

597
00:29:30,269 --> 00:29:31,978
Just be careful.

598
00:29:31,979 --> 00:29:33,313
And don't get too
attached to this girl.

599
00:29:33,314 --> 00:29:34,898
- Okay.

600
00:29:34,899 --> 00:29:38,359
- We need to find some more
things out about her, okay?

601
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:40,403
We can't save the world.

602
00:29:40,404 --> 00:29:41,821
- I'm not trying
to save the world.

603
00:29:41,822 --> 00:29:44,699
Just one little girl.

604
00:29:44,700 --> 00:29:46,576
- So what else do
you know about her?

605
00:29:46,577 --> 00:29:49,329
- I was at the homeless
shelter today, and there was

606
00:29:49,330 --> 00:29:51,539
this slime ball guy that
wouldn't leave her alone.

607
00:29:51,540 --> 00:29:52,500
- Did he threaten you?

608
00:29:52,501 --> 00:29:53,791
- No. No, no.

609
00:29:53,792 --> 00:29:56,211
Relax. I took care of it.

610
00:29:56,212 --> 00:29:58,796
But I did find
out her real name.

611
00:29:58,797 --> 00:30:01,007
It's Mary Jane.

612
00:30:01,008 --> 00:30:02,675
This homeless lady
named Devine told me.

613
00:30:02,676 --> 00:30:05,011
She's this character.

614
00:30:05,012 --> 00:30:06,846
She pushes around
a shopping cart.

615
00:30:06,847 --> 00:30:08,014
- Okay.

616
00:30:08,015 --> 00:30:09,098
I can work with that.

617
00:30:09,099 --> 00:30:12,060
- And I gave Tilly your card.

618
00:30:12,061 --> 00:30:13,436
And told her that you'd help
her get off the streets

619
00:30:13,437 --> 00:30:14,646
into the haven.

620
00:30:14,647 --> 00:30:15,356
- Absolutely.

621
00:30:15,357 --> 00:30:19,651
I'd be happy to.

622
00:30:19,652 --> 00:30:21,444
What was that for?

623
00:30:21,445 --> 00:30:23,530
- That is for putting up with
your emotional wife and her

624
00:30:23,531 --> 00:30:25,615
good Samaritan projects.

625
00:30:25,616 --> 00:30:26,824
- I should do that more often.

626
00:30:26,825 --> 00:30:31,120
- Yes, you should.

627
00:30:31,121 --> 00:30:34,415
[Phone ringing]

628
00:30:34,416 --> 00:30:35,583
- This is mack.

629
00:30:35,584 --> 00:30:37,752
- It's Steve.

630
00:30:37,753 --> 00:30:39,504
- Hey, how you doin', man?

631
00:30:39,505 --> 00:30:40,422
- Well, surviving.

632
00:30:40,423 --> 00:30:42,215
How about you?

633
00:30:42,216 --> 00:30:43,299
- I'm okay.

634
00:30:43,300 --> 00:30:45,927
Unfortunately, there's
no shortage of runaways.

635
00:30:45,928 --> 00:30:47,470
- Hey, I have a
favor I need to ask.

636
00:30:47,471 --> 00:30:49,138
- Shoot.

637
00:30:49,139 --> 00:30:51,391
- My wife, Laura, she just
started volunteering downtown

638
00:30:51,392 --> 00:30:53,059
at the homeless shelter, and
she came across this

639
00:30:53,060 --> 00:30:55,353
little homeless girl.

640
00:30:55,354 --> 00:30:57,939
She says she reminds
her of Elizabeth.

641
00:30:57,940 --> 00:30:59,399
- Well, I'm really glad she
found something to

642
00:30:59,400 --> 00:31:00,400
make her feel good.

643
00:31:00,401 --> 00:31:01,651
That's important.

644
00:31:01,652 --> 00:31:04,028
What is it you need me to do?

645
00:31:04,029 --> 00:31:05,613
- Apparently, this girl
showed up one day and nobody

646
00:31:05,614 --> 00:31:08,575
seems to know where
she came from.

647
00:31:08,576 --> 00:31:12,620
I have a name and a picture
Laura took with

648
00:31:12,621 --> 00:31:13,621
her cell phone.

649
00:31:13,622 --> 00:31:16,416
She looks like she's
about eight or nine.

650
00:31:16,417 --> 00:31:17,875
I need you to find out
whatever you can about her.

651
00:31:17,876 --> 00:31:19,586
- Has she been in the system?

652
00:31:19,587 --> 00:31:21,045
- I'm not sure.

653
00:31:21,046 --> 00:31:24,173
I think her name is Mary Jane.

654
00:31:24,174 --> 00:31:27,427
People on the street
call her punkin.

655
00:31:27,428 --> 00:31:30,513
- It's not much to go on, but
send me the pic and I'll run

656
00:31:30,514 --> 00:31:33,391
her against all my old runaway
cases and see what I can come

657
00:31:33,392 --> 00:31:34,351
up with.

658
00:31:34,352 --> 00:31:35,768
- Great. Thanks mack, I
owe you one.

659
00:31:35,769 --> 00:31:43,769
- I'll be in touch.

660
00:31:51,160 --> 00:31:59,160
[Engine roaring]

661
00:32:15,434 --> 00:32:17,727
- Hey. Let me help you
with that.

662
00:32:17,728 --> 00:32:22,440
- Okay. Thank you.

663
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:23,816
- I just got off the phone
with mack over at the missing

664
00:32:23,817 --> 00:32:25,818
children's department.

665
00:32:25,819 --> 00:32:28,071
- You have no idea how
much that means to me.

666
00:32:28,072 --> 00:32:30,073
- Don't get too
excited just yet.

667
00:32:30,074 --> 00:32:33,910
He's gonna do some digging
and see what he can find out.

668
00:32:33,911 --> 00:32:36,120
- Okay. So I have an idea.

669
00:32:36,121 --> 00:32:37,413
- Okay.

670
00:32:37,414 --> 00:32:38,956
- I would love if we could
start a foundation honoring

671
00:32:38,957 --> 00:32:41,042
Elizabeth, you know, helping
kids and teens get off the

672
00:32:41,043 --> 00:32:45,338
street.

673
00:32:45,339 --> 00:32:47,173
You don't like it.

674
00:32:47,174 --> 00:32:51,052
- No. No. I love it.

675
00:32:51,053 --> 00:32:54,347
I'm just... Well, I'm just glad
that you're starting to think

676
00:32:54,348 --> 00:32:56,557
straight now and not talking
about Elizabeth's

677
00:32:56,558 --> 00:33:03,564
ghost anymore.

678
00:33:03,565 --> 00:33:05,650
- What's that?

679
00:33:05,651 --> 00:33:08,861
- It's a Rose petal.

680
00:33:08,862 --> 00:33:14,409
I found it in my office.

681
00:33:14,410 --> 00:33:15,077
- Dig in.

682
00:33:15,078 --> 00:33:16,285
Good job, man!

683
00:33:16,286 --> 00:33:18,413
- Watch out for land mines.

684
00:33:18,414 --> 00:33:20,832
- Sergeant pinky, keep
an eye out for B.C.

685
00:33:20,833 --> 00:33:22,083
- Attention, solders.

686
00:33:22,084 --> 00:33:23,668
- You seen punkin
and Tilly around?

687
00:33:23,669 --> 00:33:25,461
- Not today.

688
00:33:25,462 --> 00:33:29,132
I think they went on another
special ops mission.

689
00:33:29,133 --> 00:33:30,633
Have you seen your
daughter's ghost?

690
00:33:30,634 --> 00:33:31,884
- Not today.

691
00:33:31,885 --> 00:33:33,553
- I believe you, Laura.

692
00:33:33,554 --> 00:33:37,306
They all think we're crazy,
but we know better, huh?

693
00:33:37,307 --> 00:33:39,600
- Right. Will you watch my car
for me?

694
00:33:39,601 --> 00:33:40,269
- Absolutely.

695
00:33:40,270 --> 00:33:43,813
- Thank you.
- Thank you.

696
00:33:43,814 --> 00:33:45,189
- How many times are
you gonna look at that?

697
00:33:45,190 --> 00:33:48,526
- Every single time.

698
00:33:48,527 --> 00:33:49,902
- Hey, Lionel, can I
talk to you for a second?

699
00:33:49,903 --> 00:33:52,280
- Oh, sure.

700
00:33:52,281 --> 00:33:53,489
Today's not your day.

701
00:33:53,490 --> 00:33:56,242
- No. But I just felt like I
needed to be here.

702
00:33:56,243 --> 00:33:57,994
And I want to talk to you
about a project I have going.

703
00:33:57,995 --> 00:34:00,163
- Sure. What is it?

704
00:34:00,164 --> 00:34:01,581
- I'm going to start a
foundation in Elizabeth's

705
00:34:01,582 --> 00:34:04,333
honor to help kids
get off the streets.

706
00:34:04,334 --> 00:34:05,835
- What a great idea.

707
00:34:05,836 --> 00:34:07,837
What can I do?

708
00:34:07,838 --> 00:34:09,589
- Well, you're already
helping, but I was thinking

709
00:34:09,590 --> 00:34:12,592
maybe we could get the
foundation lined up with your

710
00:34:12,593 --> 00:34:15,178
shelter so they could get food
and clothes or maybe even

711
00:34:15,179 --> 00:34:16,637
anything you need.

712
00:34:16,638 --> 00:34:18,723
- Wow, I don't know
what to say, Laura.

713
00:34:18,724 --> 00:34:21,684
The shelter desperately needs
donations to keep

714
00:34:21,685 --> 00:34:23,519
that door open.

hurt real bad one day, lady,

other people's business.

Her name was Elizabeth.

But she had something wrong
with her heart and she died.

much of my little girl.

Even though she's in heaven,
every time I'm at the shelter,

she takes me straight to you.

- She's an angel.

801
00:38:20,007 --> 00:38:23,009
- She is an angel, and she's
your guardian angel because

802
00:38:23,010 --> 00:38:27,346
she takes me to you
when you need help.

would come stay with me and my

to share it with you too.

tell me we had company.

Teddy bear?

to Steve for a minute? Okay.

girl in Elizabeth's bedroom.

talked to me first before

Elizabeth came to me with
really sad eyes, took me to

825

was trying to take her away.

have warned me.

I don't care.

think you see her.

punkin sees her too.

white Rose, the same

Her name is Mary Jane Monroe.

00:45:23,012 --> 00:45:28,934
- Yeah.

893
00:45:28,935 --> 00:45:31,103
- Steve?

894
00:45:31,104 --> 00:45:33,564
- I know what you're
gonna say, Laura.

895
00:45:33,565 --> 00:45:35,524
You want to adopt her.

896
00:45:35,525 --> 00:45:43,525
- Honey, it's the right
thing to do, you know?

897
00:45:49,539 --> 00:45:56,086
- I just need a
little bit of time. Okay?

898
00:45:56,087 --> 00:46:04,087
- Okay.

899
00:46:04,345 --> 00:46:06,221
- I need to go take
care of something.

900
00:46:06,222 --> 00:46:14,222
- Okay.

901
00:46:30,288 --> 00:46:33,540
- Hey. I need to talk to you.

902
00:46:33,541 --> 00:46:34,833
- I don't know you.

903
00:46:34,834 --> 00:46:39,254
- I know you. You're Devine.

904
00:46:39,255 --> 00:46:40,631
I'm a cop.

905
00:46:40,632 --> 00:46:42,674
- What do you want?

906
00:46:42,675 --> 00:46:45,052
- My wife, Laura,
works in the shelter.

907
00:46:45,053 --> 00:46:47,554
I'm looking for a
girl on the street.

908
00:46:47,555 --> 00:46:49,181
- Well, why didn't you say so?

909
00:46:49,182 --> 00:46:50,641
Go over to 13th
and state street.

910
00:46:50,642 --> 00:46:52,434
They've got plenty there.

911
00:46:52,435 --> 00:46:53,560
- That's cute.

912
00:46:53,561 --> 00:46:54,603
That's real cute.

913
00:46:54,604 --> 00:46:55,938
Her name's Tilly.

914
00:46:55,939 --> 00:46:57,731
- I know the girl
you're talking about.

915
00:46:57,732 --> 00:47:00,943
I saw her in front of
the shelter earlier.

916
00:47:00,944 --> 00:47:03,320
- How did you know punkin's
name was Mary Jane?

917
00:47:03,321 --> 00:47:04,863
- It's no mystery.

918
00:47:04,864 --> 00:47:06,949
Me and her mama were friends.

919
00:47:06,950 --> 00:47:11,203
I'm the one who
found her mama dead.

920
00:47:11,204 --> 00:47:12,955
I looked for punkin, but I
couldn't find her until I saw

921
00:47:12,956 --> 00:47:19,169
her the other day with Tilly.

922
00:47:19,170 --> 00:47:20,420
- I may need to bring you in
for some more questioning,

923
00:47:20,421 --> 00:47:21,922
so stick around.

924
00:47:21,923 --> 00:47:23,882
- Well, where am I gonna go?

925
00:47:23,883 --> 00:47:26,426
There goes the trip to Jamaica.

926
00:47:26,427 --> 00:47:34,427
I better call my travel agent,
rearrange some flights.

927
00:47:37,230 --> 00:47:40,649
- Tilly, right?

928
00:47:40,650 --> 00:47:41,526
- Yeah, and you're a cop.

929
00:47:41,526 --> 00:47:42,485
What do you want?

930
00:47:42,486 --> 00:47:43,610
- My name's Steve.

931
00:47:43,611 --> 00:47:48,240
My wife's Laura.

932
00:47:48,241 --> 00:47:50,284
- She's a good lady
for helping out punkin.

933
00:47:50,285 --> 00:47:52,286
- She wants to help you out too.

934
00:47:52,287 --> 00:47:54,663
There's a place she
mentioned called the haven.

935
00:47:54,664 --> 00:47:55,498
It's a good place.

936
00:47:55,499 --> 00:47:56,790
It will get you off the street.

937
00:47:56,791 --> 00:47:59,418
I'd like to take you there.

938
00:47:59,419 --> 00:48:00,544
- It's not foster care, is it?

939
00:48:00,545 --> 00:48:02,170
- No. No, it's not foster care.

940
00:48:02,171 --> 00:48:04,923
It's room and board,
three meals a day.

941
00:48:04,924 --> 00:48:06,258
- There's always a catch.

942
00:48:06,259 --> 00:48:07,634
- There's no catch, Tilly.

943
00:48:07,635 --> 00:48:09,720
But you will have
to make an effort.

944
00:48:09,721 --> 00:48:10,929
It's a great place.

945
00:48:10,930 --> 00:48:13,098
Laura wouldn't steer you wrong.

946
00:48:13,099 --> 00:48:16,935
But you're gonna have
to make a decision.

947
00:48:16,936 --> 00:48:18,770
- You need to go.

948
00:48:18,771 --> 00:48:21,565
You can't stay here.

949
00:48:21,566 --> 00:48:22,691
- All right, I'll go.

950
00:48:22,692 --> 00:48:24,735
But if I don't like
it, I'm outta there.

951
00:48:24,736 --> 00:48:27,738
- Fair enough. Hop in.

952
00:48:27,739 --> 00:48:29,448
- Get out of here. Go on.

953
00:48:29,449 --> 00:48:37,449
- Go, Tilly. Go.

954
00:48:49,302 --> 00:48:55,390
- Well, this is it.

955
00:48:55,391 --> 00:48:57,059
- I don't know.

956
00:48:57,060 --> 00:48:58,685
I just... I don't
like these places.

957
00:48:58,686 --> 00:49:00,020
- Tilly, listen.

958
00:49:00,021 --> 00:49:01,938
This is a great
opportunity for you.

959
00:49:01,939 --> 00:49:05,609
Don't blow it off.

960
00:49:05,610 --> 00:49:08,904
- Do they have good food?

961
00:49:08,905 --> 00:49:10,656
- Yes, they have good food.

962
00:49:10,657 --> 00:49:14,242
So I've heard.

963
00:49:14,243 --> 00:49:16,411
- All right, well thank
you for helping me.

964
00:49:16,412 --> 00:49:17,663
- Thank Laura.

965
00:49:17,664 --> 00:49:19,539
She'll be by to visit.

966
00:49:19,540 --> 00:49:20,666
- Okay.

967
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:21,875
- Just be strong.

968
00:49:21,876 --> 00:49:23,835
You can do this.

969
00:49:23,836 --> 00:49:25,253
You have a support system in
place now, people who

970
00:49:25,254 --> 00:49:31,593
love and care about you.

971
00:49:31,594 --> 00:49:33,428
- Thank you.

972
00:49:33,429 --> 00:49:41,429
- Let's get you inside.

973
00:49:52,573 --> 00:49:53,699
- I'm home.

974
00:49:53,700 --> 00:49:56,368
- Hey! I didn't think you were
gonna make it.

975
00:49:56,369 --> 00:49:58,370
- Good news, ladies.

976
00:49:58,371 --> 00:50:00,914
Tilly is off the streets
and into the haven.

977
00:50:00,915 --> 00:50:02,582
- How did you get her to go?

978
00:50:02,583 --> 00:50:04,209
- It wasn't me.

979
00:50:04,210 --> 00:50:06,211
It's you she trusts, and she
wanted me to tell you how much

980
00:50:06,212 --> 00:50:07,796
she misses you.

981
00:50:07,797 --> 00:50:09,506
- So she's gonna be okay.

982
00:50:09,507 --> 00:50:11,007
- She's gonna be
better than okay.

983
00:50:11,008 --> 00:50:13,218
She's got a warm bed
and plenty of food.

984
00:50:13,219 --> 00:50:14,095
- I know what that is.

985
00:50:14,096 --> 00:50:15,971
That's a glock 9.

986
00:50:15,972 --> 00:50:18,014
Does that have
fifteen in a clip?

987
00:50:18,015 --> 00:50:21,059
- What?

988
00:50:21,060 --> 00:50:22,561
- How did you know that?

989
00:50:22,562 --> 00:50:23,812
- My mom showed me.

990
00:50:23,813 --> 00:50:26,690
She had lots of guns
hiding around the house.

991
00:50:26,691 --> 00:50:31,403
Glocks, m16's, ak-47's.

992
00:50:31,404 --> 00:50:34,990
- Punkin, punkin, do you
think you can show me where

993
00:50:34,991 --> 00:50:38,452
your mom kept those guns?

994
00:50:38,453 --> 00:50:42,122
- Um, I don't really
want to go back there.

995
00:50:42,123 --> 00:50:43,331
- It's okay.

996
00:50:43,332 --> 00:50:47,753
- What if I went with
you and protected you?

997
00:50:47,754 --> 00:50:49,045
- Are you sure?

998
00:50:49,046 --> 00:50:51,173
- It will be fine.

999
00:50:51,174 --> 00:50:54,509
I promise I won't
let anyone hurt you.

1000
00:50:54,510 --> 00:50:55,927
- Okay.

1001
00:50:55,928 --> 00:50:58,638
Then I think I can go.

1002
00:50:58,639 --> 00:50:59,432
- All right.

1003
00:50:59,433 --> 00:51:01,558
Let's go do some investigating.

1004
00:51:01,559 --> 00:51:02,601
We'll be back in an hour.

1005
00:51:02,602 --> 00:51:04,311
- Grab your jacket, okay?

1006
00:51:04,312 --> 00:51:12,312
Be careful.

1007
00:51:14,572 --> 00:51:15,947
- Will you come in with me?

1008
00:51:15,948 --> 00:51:17,949
- Yeah. The guns are in
the garage

1009
00:51:17,950 --> 00:51:21,912
and I know the code to get in.

1010
00:51:21,913 --> 00:51:29,913
- Okay. Let's go.

1011
00:51:48,981 --> 00:51:50,816
- Where'd she keep the guns?

1012
00:51:50,817 --> 00:51:53,068
- They're in the attic.

1013
00:51:53,069 --> 00:51:54,653
- Up here?
- Uh-huh.

1014
00:51:54,654 --> 00:52:02,654
- Okay. You stand over here.

1015
00:52:07,250 --> 00:52:08,625
I'll be right back.

1016
00:52:08,626 --> 00:52:09,751
Stay here, okay?

1017
00:52:09,752 --> 00:52:10,419
- Okay.

1018
00:52:10,419 --> 00:52:11,128
- Are you all right?

1019
00:52:11,129 --> 00:52:19,129
- Uh-huh.

1020
00:53:22,992 --> 00:53:23,992
- It's Paulie.

1021
00:53:23,993 --> 00:53:26,244
Mary Jane, honey, you hide.

1022
00:53:26,245 --> 00:53:27,704
You hide and don't come out.

1023
00:53:27,705 --> 00:53:28,747
Go.

1024
00:53:28,748 --> 00:53:29,789
[Knock at door]

1025
00:53:29,790 --> 00:53:31,583
Open up Sarah!

1026
00:53:31,584 --> 00:53:32,501
- What are you doing here?

1027
00:53:32,502 --> 00:53:34,210
I said never come to my house.

1028
00:53:34,211 --> 00:53:35,253
- Don't play games
with me, Sarah.

1029
00:53:35,254 --> 00:53:36,213
Where are they?

1030
00:53:36,214 --> 00:53:37,505
- It's not how it works.

1031
00:53:37,506 --> 00:53:38,215
You give me the money, and the
guns will be

1032
00:53:38,216 --> 00:53:39,633
delivered like always.

1033
00:53:39,634 --> 00:53:41,217
- I hired you to get those
guns past customs for me.

1034
00:53:41,218 --> 00:53:42,136
Don't piss me off, Sarah.

1035
00:53:42,137 --> 00:53:44,930
- This is not working for me!

1036
00:53:44,931 --> 00:53:45,681
It's too dangerous.

1037
00:53:45,682 --> 00:53:47,140
I want out.

1038
00:53:47,141 --> 00:53:48,100
- There ain't no out.

1039
00:53:48,101 --> 00:53:49,476
- I can't risk going to jail.

1040
00:53:49,477 --> 00:53:51,102
I've gotta be here
for my little girl.

1041
00:53:51,103 --> 00:53:52,021
- Your little girl?

1042
00:53:52,022 --> 00:53:53,313
No, your little
girl's not nothing.

1043
00:53:53,314 --> 00:53:56,441
Look, fine, fine,
give me my guns.

1044
00:53:56,442 --> 00:53:57,360
Give me my guns and you're out.

1045
00:53:57,361 --> 00:53:58,361
You're out for good. I promise.

1046
00:53:58,362 --> 00:54:00,070
- I'm not stupid, Paulie.

1047
00:54:00,071 --> 00:54:01,738
Give me the money first.

1048
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,657
- I'm gonna tell you
this one more time, Sarah.

1049
00:54:03,658 --> 00:54:06,493
Once! Give me my guns!

1050
00:54:06,494 --> 00:54:08,745
- And I'm gonna tell
you this one more time.

1051
00:54:08,746 --> 00:54:11,039
You give me the money, and the
guns will be delivered,

1052
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,082
and then I am out.

1053
00:54:12,083 --> 00:54:13,291
It's over. End of story.

1054
00:54:13,292 --> 00:54:14,334
Now get out.

1055
00:54:14,335 --> 00:54:22,335
No, no! Paulie!

1056
00:54:22,718 --> 00:54:28,848
- Get up!

1057
00:54:28,849 --> 00:54:29,933
Get up, Sarah.

1058
00:54:29,934 --> 00:54:37,934
You ain't hurt that bad!

1059
00:54:41,153 --> 00:54:47,492
- [Crying] Mom.

1060
00:54:47,493 --> 00:54:55,493
Wake up.

1061
00:55:08,389 --> 00:55:16,389
- Punkin?

1062
00:55:18,983 --> 00:55:22,819
- My mommy died.

1063
00:55:22,820 --> 00:55:24,029
- I know, sweetie.

1064
00:55:24,030 --> 00:55:26,489
Come here.

1065
00:55:26,490 --> 00:55:34,490
I'm so sorry.

1066
00:55:34,957 --> 00:55:38,126
Do you know who did this to her?

1067
00:55:38,127 --> 00:55:41,588
- That bad man who
was trying to take me.

1068
00:55:41,589 --> 00:55:46,176
- Paulie?

1069
00:55:46,177 --> 00:55:49,471
Come here.

1070
00:55:49,472 --> 00:55:57,472
He's never gonna
come near you again. Okay?

1071
00:56:01,067 --> 00:56:03,234
- Why don't you
take a picture, pig?

1072
00:56:03,235 --> 00:56:06,821
It lasts longer.

1073
00:56:06,822 --> 00:56:07,906
You got nothing on me.

1074
00:56:07,907 --> 00:56:10,450
I don't even know why I'm here.

1075
00:56:10,451 --> 00:56:14,788
- Try arms dealing and murder.

1076
00:56:14,789 --> 00:56:16,623
Recognize her?

1077
00:56:16,624 --> 00:56:18,333
That's Sarah Monroe.

1078
00:56:18,334 --> 00:56:21,086
She was only 34 years old.

1079
00:56:21,087 --> 00:56:23,254
- Don't know her.

1080
00:56:23,255 --> 00:56:25,173
- Take a closer look!

1081
00:56:25,174 --> 00:56:26,466
- I said I don't know her!

1082
00:56:26,467 --> 00:56:28,426
I've never seen her
before in my life!

1083
00:56:28,427 --> 00:56:29,719
- That's funny, because I
have an eyewitness that puts

1084
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,805
you at the house the
night of the murder.

1085
00:56:31,806 --> 00:56:34,390
- Yeah, and I got three
alibis that say otherwise.

1086
00:56:34,391 --> 00:56:38,978
- Oh, well, three alibis?

1087
00:56:38,979 --> 00:56:40,772
I haven't even given you a
date and yet you

1088
00:56:40,773 --> 00:56:42,857
have three alibis.

1089
00:56:42,858 --> 00:56:43,858
- You know what?

1090
00:56:43,859 --> 00:56:45,652
I'm done answering
your stupid questions.

1091
00:56:45,653 --> 00:56:48,238
I want to see my lawyer.

1092
00:56:48,239 --> 00:56:50,865
Are we through?

1093
00:56:50,866 --> 00:56:53,243
- For now.

1094
00:56:53,244 --> 00:57:01,244
Get out of my face.

1095
00:57:07,591 --> 00:57:10,593
- Punkin, we wanted to talk
to you about something.

1096
00:57:10,594 --> 00:57:12,428
- Okay, what?

1097
00:57:12,429 --> 00:57:15,223
- Well, we met
with a lawyer today.

1098
00:57:15,224 --> 00:57:17,517
- Am I in trouble?

1099
00:57:17,518 --> 00:57:19,144
- No, you're not in trouble.

1100
00:57:19,145 --> 00:57:22,230
We wanted to talk to
somebody about adopting you.

1101
00:57:22,231 --> 00:57:24,107
We want to be your parents.

1102
00:57:24,108 --> 00:57:25,358
- You'd be our daughter.

1103
00:57:25,359 --> 00:57:28,444
- For real?
- For real.

1104
00:57:28,445 --> 00:57:30,655
- I'd like that very much.

1105
00:57:30,656 --> 00:57:32,657
- And we wanted to see if you
want to keep your real name,

1106
00:57:32,658 --> 00:57:36,494
Mary Jane, or get a
completely new one.

1107
00:57:36,495 --> 00:57:37,996
- A new name?

1108
00:57:37,997 --> 00:57:40,957
Like what?

1109
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:44,377
- We were thinking faith
Elizabeth because

1110
00:57:44,378 --> 00:57:46,504
Elizabeth led us to you.

1111
00:57:46,505 --> 00:57:47,922
- I like that name.

1112
00:57:47,923 --> 00:57:50,466
- Then faith
Elizabeth prince it is.

1113
00:57:50,467 --> 00:57:51,801
- Yes!

1114
00:57:51,802 --> 00:57:55,180
- But, I'm still gonna
call you punkin sometimes.

1115
00:57:55,181 --> 00:58:03,181
- Okay. Come push me
on the swing.

1116
00:58:05,149 --> 00:58:06,357
- Nice place.

1117
00:58:06,358 --> 00:58:08,735
Woe! What's the big hurry?

1118
00:58:08,736 --> 00:58:09,777
- I'll scream.

1119
00:58:09,778 --> 00:58:11,154
- Go right ahead.

1120
00:58:11,155 --> 00:58:12,739
I know who you are.

1121
00:58:12,740 --> 00:58:15,033
I know nobody cares about you.

1122
00:58:15,034 --> 00:58:16,576
You're a little dirt bag with
no where to go but right back

1123
00:58:16,577 --> 00:58:19,662
to the streets where you belong.

1124
00:58:19,663 --> 00:58:21,956
Now you're gonna help me find
that little brat punkin.

1125
00:58:21,957 --> 00:58:23,041
- I don't know where she is.

1126
00:58:23,042 --> 00:58:25,043
- Oh, I think you do.

1127
00:58:25,044 --> 00:58:28,630
I saw that pig drop you
off here the other night.

1128
00:58:28,631 --> 00:58:30,131
- Get out of here now, Paulie.

1129
00:58:30,132 --> 00:58:32,258
- Says who?

1130
00:58:32,259 --> 00:58:34,302
- That would be me.

1131
00:58:34,303 --> 00:58:36,137
- Never show your
face here ever again.

1132
00:58:36,138 --> 00:58:39,182
Do you understand?

1133
00:58:39,183 --> 00:58:47,183
- Now get out of here.

1134
00:58:50,903 --> 00:58:52,904
[Crying]

1135
00:58:52,905 --> 00:58:53,988
- Are you okay?

1136
00:58:53,989 --> 00:58:56,991
- Yeah.

1137
00:58:56,992 --> 00:58:57,992
- What did he say to you?

1138
00:58:57,993 --> 00:59:00,371
- He wanted to know
where punkin was.

1139
00:59:00,496 --> 00:59:02,957
- What'd you tell him?
- Nothing.

1140
00:59:03,415 --> 00:59:08,169
- He's never gonna hurt
you ever again, I promise.

1141
00:59:08,170 --> 00:59:11,381
How are you doing here anyway?

1142
00:59:11,382 --> 00:59:13,549
- I'm doing real good.

1143
00:59:13,550 --> 00:59:16,928
They treat me nice here, and
I'm learning to type

1144
00:59:16,929 --> 00:59:18,930
on a computer.

1145
00:59:18,931 --> 00:59:21,891
I never knew learning
could be so much fun.

1146
00:59:21,892 --> 00:59:24,394
- Well, in two years they're
gonna help you get a G.E.D., and

1147
00:59:24,395 --> 00:59:26,396
a counselor will find an
apartment and a job

1148
00:59:26,397 --> 00:59:28,064
whenever you're ready.

1149
00:59:28,065 --> 00:59:30,733
- Thank you, miss Laura.

1150
00:59:30,734 --> 00:59:33,403
I'm so glad punkin
has you for a mom.

1151
00:59:33,404 --> 00:59:36,698
- And I'm very
lucky to have her.

1152
00:59:36,699 --> 00:59:39,367
Now we want you as
part of our family.

1153
00:59:39,368 --> 00:59:41,995
We want to see you succeed.

1154
00:59:41,996 --> 00:59:43,871
- I'll make you
proud, miss Laura.

1155
00:59:43,872 --> 00:59:47,375
- Make yourself
proud first, Tilly. Okay?

1156
00:59:47,376 --> 00:59:54,841
Let's get you inside.

1157
00:59:54,842 --> 00:59:56,009
- Where's the girl, Devine?

1158
00:59:56,010 --> 00:59:57,719
- How should I know?

1159
00:59:57,720 --> 00:59:59,262
- I saw you talking to
that pig the other night.

1160
00:59:59,263 --> 01:00:00,180
Where's she at?

1161
01:00:00,180 --> 01:00:00,931
- Leave her alone!

1162
01:00:00,932 --> 01:00:04,142
She don't know nothing!

1163
01:00:04,143 --> 01:00:05,518
- You have no business
talking to Tilly.

1164
01:00:05,519 --> 01:00:06,811
- I didn't break any laws.

1165
01:00:06,812 --> 01:00:07,979
- What do you want with punkin?

1166
01:00:07,980 --> 01:00:09,731
- I don't know what
you're talking about.

1167
01:00:09,732 --> 01:00:11,357
- I'm warning you, Paulie,
you stay away

1168
01:00:11,358 --> 01:00:12,525
from my daughter.

1169
01:00:12,526 --> 01:00:14,193
- Right. Your daughter.

1170
01:00:14,194 --> 01:00:17,488
I'll remember to
steer clear of her.

1171
01:00:17,489 --> 01:00:25,489
- You've been warned.

1172
01:00:31,545 --> 01:00:34,213
- Hey. I don't want you going
out with punkin

1173
01:00:34,214 --> 01:00:36,674
unless you're with me, okay?

1174
01:00:36,675 --> 01:00:38,676
- Why?

1175
01:00:38,677 --> 01:00:40,845
- I slipped up and mentioned
she's our daughter.

1176
01:00:40,846 --> 01:00:43,639
Paulie knows she's with us.

1177
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:45,767
- Why haven't you arrested him?

1178
01:00:45,768 --> 01:00:47,643
- The case isn't
strong enough yet.

1179
01:00:47,644 --> 01:00:49,020
I just need some more time.

1180
01:00:49,021 --> 01:00:51,397
But until then, we need you to
keep a close eye on punkin.

1181
01:00:51,398 --> 01:00:54,859
- Okay. We'll be careful.

1182
01:00:54,860 --> 01:01:02,860
- I'm gonna go check on her.

1183
01:01:08,957 --> 01:01:11,417
- Night, daddy.

1184
01:01:11,418 --> 01:01:19,418
- Night, sweetheart.

1185
01:01:47,496 --> 01:01:49,038
- What'd you find out?

1186
01:01:49,039 --> 01:01:51,374
- Adoption went through.

1187
01:01:51,375 --> 01:01:52,583
Word on the street, she's
gonna have a fundraiser at the

1188
01:01:52,584 --> 01:01:54,502
shelter tomorrow night.

1189
01:01:54,503 --> 01:01:56,003
Perfect spot to take her.

1190
01:01:56,004 --> 01:01:59,715
Lots of people, very
little security, if any.

1191
01:01:59,716 --> 01:02:00,716
- You know, if they tie me in
with her mother's death, they

1192
01:02:00,717 --> 01:02:03,010
tie me to the guns.

1193
01:02:03,011 --> 01:02:05,471
You think you can get out
without getting caught?

1194
01:02:05,472 --> 01:02:07,598
- I'm a professional.

1195
01:02:07,599 --> 01:02:08,517
I want half the money up
front, the other

1196
01:02:08,518 --> 01:02:10,143
half on delivery.

1197
01:02:10,144 --> 01:02:14,939
Once you have her,
she's your problem.

1198
01:02:14,940 --> 01:02:22,940
- Done.

1199
01:02:35,377 --> 01:02:36,794
- What?

1200
01:02:36,795 --> 01:02:39,505
- You look beautiful,
that's what.

1201
01:02:39,506 --> 01:02:44,886
- Thank you.

1202
01:02:44,887 --> 01:02:51,100
- This is a present
for you, mom.

1203
01:02:51,101 --> 01:02:55,104
- Thank you. I love it.

1204
01:02:55,105 --> 01:02:58,733
- Let me put it on.

1205
01:02:58,734 --> 01:03:01,944
- It's beautiful.

1206
01:03:01,945 --> 01:03:09,945
- Now you can have both your
girls close to your heart.

1207
01:03:16,627 --> 01:03:19,795
I've been finding a few of
these around the house lately.

1208
01:03:19,796 --> 01:03:25,885
- Me, too.
- Me three.

1209
01:03:25,886 --> 01:03:27,261
- Shall we, ladies?

1210
01:03:27,262 --> 01:03:31,682
- Let's go.

1211
01:03:31,683 --> 01:03:36,270
- You guys look great.

1212
01:03:36,271 --> 01:03:44,271
[Music]

1213
01:03:45,739 --> 01:03:47,114
- All right, wait here.

1214
01:03:47,115 --> 01:03:48,033
I'm gonna go get this little
girl and bring her out to you.

1215
01:03:48,033 --> 01:03:48,825
- All right.

1216
01:03:48,826 --> 01:03:49,992
- Go to the spot we discussed.

1217
01:03:49,993 --> 01:03:51,202
Someone will be
there to pick her up.

1218
01:03:51,203 --> 01:03:52,453
- I know, dude. I got it.

1219
01:03:52,454 --> 01:03:54,455
- By all means, do
not stop for anybody.

1220
01:03:54,456 --> 01:03:55,998
- Why would I stop for anybody?

1221
01:03:55,999 --> 01:03:57,458
- Why'd you buy that hat?

1222
01:03:57,459 --> 01:03:58,459
Get the other half of our money.

1223
01:03:58,460 --> 01:03:59,336
- I'll get the money.

1224
01:03:59,337 --> 01:04:02,296
I like this hat.

1225
01:04:02,297 --> 01:04:03,673
- Laura, how are you?

1226
01:04:03,674 --> 01:04:05,049
You look wonderful tonight.

1227
01:04:05,050 --> 01:04:08,678
- Good to see you.

1228
01:04:08,679 --> 01:04:09,679
- This is my husband, Steve.

1229
01:04:09,680 --> 01:04:10,556
- Nice to meet you, sir.

1230
01:04:10,557 --> 01:04:13,516
- Good to meet you.

1231
01:04:13,517 --> 01:04:14,434
- Hello, ladies.

1232
01:04:14,435 --> 01:04:16,060
- Hi.

1233
01:04:16,061 --> 01:04:17,520
- Hello, soldiers.

1234
01:04:17,521 --> 01:04:19,272
- I'd like to personally
thank each and every one of

1235
01:04:19,273 --> 01:04:21,482
you for coming here tonight
to help kick off the

1236
01:04:21,483 --> 01:04:24,193
Elizabeth S. Prince foundation.

1237
01:04:24,194 --> 01:04:27,905
This is a very worthwhile
charity begun by a loving,

1238
01:04:27,906 --> 01:04:31,867
giving and honest woman, Laura
prince and her

1239
01:04:31,868 --> 01:04:33,995
courageous husband, Steve.

1240
01:04:33,996 --> 01:04:37,331
[Applause]

1241
01:04:37,332 --> 01:04:40,585
- If every one of us would
take one lost soul, just one

1242
01:04:40,586 --> 01:04:46,340
into our hearts, we would live
in a far safer world filled

1243
01:04:46,341 --> 01:04:49,010
with many, many
beautiful people.

1244
01:04:49,011 --> 01:04:54,473
[Applause]

1245
01:04:54,474 --> 01:04:57,143
- I began this shelter 20
years ago to provide as much

1246
01:04:57,144 --> 01:05:00,605
help as I could for
unfortunate children

1247
01:05:00,606 --> 01:05:02,898
and teens and adults.

1248
01:05:02,899 --> 01:05:06,444
Make no mistake, money matters.

1249
01:05:06,445 --> 01:05:08,904
Money is the difference
between taking ten kids and a

1250
01:05:08,905 --> 01:05:11,824
hundred off the street.

1251
01:05:11,825 --> 01:05:14,827
Please, give me a hundred.

1252
01:05:14,828 --> 01:05:20,249
[Applause]

1253
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,959
- I'd like to ask Laura
prince to come up and

1254
01:05:21,960 --> 01:05:23,044
say a few words.

1255
01:05:23,045 --> 01:05:30,509
[Applause]

1256
01:05:30,510 --> 01:05:33,429
- Thank you.

1257
01:05:33,430 --> 01:05:37,058
First of all, I would like to
thank every one of you for

1258
01:05:37,059 --> 01:05:41,187
coming out tonight and helping
us support our foundation.

1259
01:05:41,188 --> 01:05:49,188
This is a very, very special
evening for my husband and I.

1260
01:05:56,078 --> 01:05:58,746
When my daughter died...

1261
01:05:58,747 --> 01:05:59,914
- I don't feel very good.

1262
01:05:59,915 --> 01:06:01,582
I need to go to the bathroom.

1263
01:06:01,583 --> 01:06:02,792
- You stay here.

1264
01:06:02,793 --> 01:06:05,002
I'll take her so you
can listen to Laura.

1265
01:06:05,003 --> 01:06:07,380
- Don't take your eyes off her.

1266
01:06:07,381 --> 01:06:11,801
- the beat of my
heart actually changed.

1267
01:06:11,802 --> 01:06:15,304
I knew I had to find something
to keep myself busy as well

1268
01:06:15,305 --> 01:06:18,307
as in her honor.

1269
01:06:18,308 --> 01:06:21,519
So I started volunteering here
at the shelter, and I came

1270
01:06:21,520 --> 01:06:24,855
across a little homeless
girl named punkin.

1271
01:06:24,856 --> 01:06:25,856
She's actually here tonight.

1272
01:06:25,857 --> 01:06:27,233
- She'll be right back.

1273
01:06:27,234 --> 01:06:28,317
She had to use the
little girl's room.

1274
01:06:28,318 --> 01:06:35,616
[Laughter]

1275
01:06:35,617 --> 01:06:41,664
- Every single time I saw
punkin, she reminded me

1276
01:06:41,665 --> 01:06:45,209
of my Elizabeth...

1277
01:06:45,210 --> 01:06:46,627
- Are you still in there?

1278
01:06:46,628 --> 01:06:49,130
- I strongly believe that
no child should ever have to

1279
01:06:49,131 --> 01:06:53,843
live on the streets, so my
husband and I took punkin into

1280
01:06:53,844 --> 01:06:56,220
our hearts and our home.

1281
01:06:56,221 --> 01:06:58,681
- Punkin?

1282
01:06:58,682 --> 01:07:06,230
[Screaming]

1283
01:07:06,231 --> 01:07:14,231
- Punkin has helped
fill all the emptiness.

1284
01:07:14,906 --> 01:07:17,783
So tonight, we implore each
and every one of you because

1285
01:07:17,784 --> 01:07:19,285
we need your help.

1286
01:07:19,286 --> 01:07:22,371
So please donate generously.

1287
01:07:22,372 --> 01:07:29,754
[Applause]

1288
01:07:29,755 --> 01:07:31,589
- Okay, that little
spot we talked about.

1289
01:07:31,590 --> 01:07:33,758
Cover her up and
I'll meet you later.

1290
01:07:33,759 --> 01:07:35,134
- I got it. I got it.

1291
01:07:35,135 --> 01:07:37,511
I won't let you down.

1292
01:07:37,512 --> 01:07:41,474
- Last, but definitely not
least, I want to thank

1293
01:07:41,475 --> 01:07:44,310
my husband, Steve.

1294
01:07:44,311 --> 01:07:50,649
Thank you for your
incredible strength.

1295
01:07:50,650 --> 01:07:53,736
I love you.

1296
01:07:53,737 --> 01:07:57,031
I'd now like to introduce my
good friend, frank, who would

1297
01:07:57,032 --> 01:07:58,699
like to read something.

1298
01:07:58,700 --> 01:07:59,867
- I love you, frank!

1299
01:07:59,868 --> 01:08:00,660
- Way to go, frank!

1300
01:08:00,661 --> 01:08:05,623
[Applause]

1301
01:08:05,624 --> 01:08:09,210
- There was no hope from
whence she came, no calm, no

1302
01:08:09,211 --> 01:08:15,174
peace, she had no name.

1303
01:08:15,175 --> 01:08:19,804
Only sorrow and pain from
guilt and rain, one white Rose

1304
01:08:19,805 --> 01:08:25,893
brought death and change.

1305
01:08:25,894 --> 01:08:30,022
The reason to give from one
woman's heart gave a little

1306
01:08:30,023 --> 01:08:35,486
girl a chance and
brand new start.

1307
01:08:35,487 --> 01:08:40,366
A beautiful homeless child and
one white Rose brought one ray

1308
01:08:40,367 --> 01:08:46,539
of light, it's what
Elizabeth chose.

1309
01:08:46,540 --> 01:08:50,918
But Elizabeth's gift is
what's shone through.

1310
01:08:50,919 --> 01:08:56,507
Now a new path that
nurtured and grew.

1311
01:08:56,508 --> 01:08:59,260
There was this gift from
heaven above, from tragic

1312
01:08:59,261 --> 01:09:04,974
death came stability and love.

1313
01:09:04,975 --> 01:09:07,560
But it was Elizabeth's gift
that gave new

1314
01:09:07,561 --> 01:09:10,729
meaning to their life.

1315
01:09:10,730 --> 01:09:13,357
She saved a little girl and
brought back a husband

1316
01:09:13,358 --> 01:09:19,780
and a wife.

1317
01:09:19,781 --> 01:09:21,448
We love you, Elizabeth.

1318
01:09:21,449 --> 01:09:26,245
[Applause]

1319
01:09:26,246 --> 01:09:32,710
- Thank you.

1320
01:09:32,711 --> 01:09:34,230
- What seems to be
the problem, officer?

1321
01:09:34,254 --> 01:09:35,046
- You know you went right
through that stop

1322
01:09:35,213 --> 01:09:35,922
sign back there.

1323
01:09:36,131 --> 01:09:38,424
- I'm sorry. I'm really tired.

1324
01:09:38,425 --> 01:09:40,384
It's been a long day.

1325
01:09:40,385 --> 01:09:41,802
- She looks a
little tired herself.

1326
01:09:41,803 --> 01:09:46,181
- She's been playing
with her friends all day.

1327
01:09:46,182 --> 01:09:47,474
- Is punkin back yet?

1328
01:09:47,475 --> 01:09:49,476
- No. I was just gonna go
check on them.

1329
01:09:49,477 --> 01:09:51,645
I'll be right back.

1330
01:09:51,646 --> 01:09:53,397
- Is there anything
we can do here?

1331
01:09:53,398 --> 01:09:58,944
I'm very sorry.

1332
01:09:58,945 --> 01:09:59,945
[Knocking]

1333
01:09:59,946 --> 01:10:04,700
Punkin, you still in there?

1334
01:10:04,701 --> 01:10:06,285
Julie?

1335
01:10:06,286 --> 01:10:06,995
- I've got a daughter myself.

1336
01:10:06,996 --> 01:10:12,958
I know how it is.

1337
01:10:12,959 --> 01:10:13,877
Do me a favor, okay?

1338
01:10:13,878 --> 01:10:15,085
Pay attention.

1339
01:10:15,086 --> 01:10:16,046
I'll let you off with a warning.

1340
01:10:16,047 --> 01:10:17,129
- Absolutely.

1341
01:10:17,130 --> 01:10:19,840
Thank you so much, officer.

1342
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:25,804
- Punkin!

1343
01:10:25,805 --> 01:10:30,976
Julie, wake up!

1344
01:10:30,977 --> 01:10:32,561
- Julie, what happened?

1345
01:10:32,562 --> 01:10:33,313
Julie.

1346
01:10:33,314 --> 01:10:34,396
- It's chloroform.

1347
01:10:34,397 --> 01:10:35,397
- What do you mean chloroform?

1348
01:10:35,398 --> 01:10:36,191
Where's punkin?

1349
01:10:36,192 --> 01:10:38,400
- I don't know.

1350
01:10:38,401 --> 01:10:39,860
I need you to stay
here with Julie.

1351
01:10:39,861 --> 01:10:40,986
- It's Paulie.

1352
01:10:40,987 --> 01:10:42,613
I know it. It's Paulie.

1353
01:10:42,614 --> 01:10:43,948
- Listen to me.

1354
01:10:43,949 --> 01:10:45,532
- Let me go with you.

1355
01:10:45,533 --> 01:10:46,700
- No.

1356
01:10:46,701 --> 01:10:48,702
You need to stay here and
take care of Julie, okay?

1357
01:10:48,703 --> 01:10:50,829
Listen to me, listen to me,
I'm gonna bring

1358
01:10:50,830 --> 01:10:53,666
her back, okay?

1359
01:10:53,667 --> 01:10:59,755
- Find our daughter.

1360
01:10:59,756 --> 01:11:01,840
- Seven delta
requesting an a.P.B.

1361
01:11:01,841 --> 01:11:04,677
On a nine year old girl,
Caucasian, blonde hair, brown

1362
01:11:04,678 --> 01:11:08,639
eyes, approximately 4 foot
4, 70 pounds, believed to be

1363
01:11:08,640 --> 01:11:11,308
abducted in the midville
area around 19:30.

1364
01:11:11,309 --> 01:11:12,935
Seven delta, copy?

1365
01:11:12,936 --> 01:11:15,521
- Did you see anything?

1366
01:11:15,522 --> 01:11:21,777
- No. What happened?

1367
01:11:21,778 --> 01:11:24,822
- They took punkin.

1368
01:11:24,823 --> 01:11:32,823
- I'm so sorry.

1369
01:11:56,271 --> 01:11:59,440
- Elizabeth?

1370
01:11:59,441 --> 01:12:05,029
Sweetie.

1371
01:12:05,030 --> 01:12:07,823
Sweetie.

1372
01:12:07,824 --> 01:12:09,324
What is it?

1373
01:12:09,325 --> 01:12:10,409
What are you trying to tell me?

1374
01:12:10,410 --> 01:12:15,330
- Who are you talking to?

1375
01:12:15,331 --> 01:12:17,332
- Devine, I need your help.

1376
01:12:17,333 --> 01:12:19,043
- With what?

1377
01:12:19,044 --> 01:12:20,878
- My daughter. Punkin.

1378
01:12:20,879 --> 01:12:22,046
I think Paulie has her.

1379
01:12:22,047 --> 01:12:23,172
- I don't want
nothing to do with him.

1380
01:12:23,173 --> 01:12:24,339
I'll get myself killed.

1381
01:12:24,340 --> 01:12:27,009
- I know you know something.

1382
01:12:27,010 --> 01:12:28,010
You knew her mother.

1383
01:12:28,011 --> 01:12:31,513
You said you were her friend.

1384
01:12:31,514 --> 01:12:34,433
Devine, I already lost a
daughter once, I am not gonna

1385
01:12:34,434 --> 01:12:36,894
let that happen again.

1386
01:12:36,895 --> 01:12:39,229
Please.

1387
01:12:39,230 --> 01:12:41,023
- She was my friend.

1388
01:12:41,024 --> 01:12:41,983
- Then help me find Paulie.

1389
01:12:41,984 --> 01:12:43,400
- How?

1390
01:12:43,401 --> 01:12:47,696
- Show me where he lives,
where he hangs out.

1391
01:12:47,697 --> 01:12:50,657
- I know a couple of places.

1392
01:12:50,658 --> 01:12:54,036
- Great. Let's go.

1393
01:12:54,037 --> 01:12:56,413
- Sir, sir, I need to
ask you a few questions.

1394
01:12:56,414 --> 01:12:57,706
- Sure thing, officer.

1395
01:12:57,707 --> 01:12:58,707
- What is your name?

1396
01:12:58,708 --> 01:13:00,626
- My name is Gill Jentezen.

1397
01:13:00,627 --> 01:13:01,627
- And your business here?

1398
01:13:01,628 --> 01:13:03,295
- Part of the catering company.

1399
01:13:03,296 --> 01:13:05,297
We've been serving food and
cake during the speeches.

1400
01:13:05,298 --> 01:13:07,007
- You haven't seen
anything unusual?

1401
01:13:07,008 --> 01:13:07,926
Anyone suspicious?

1402
01:13:07,926 --> 01:13:08,802
- No, sir.

1403
01:13:08,803 --> 01:13:09,803
Just been doing my job.

1404
01:13:09,804 --> 01:13:11,428
Been in and out of
the kitchen all night.

1405
01:13:11,429 --> 01:13:12,596
Pity too, it seemed like
everything was going

1406
01:13:12,597 --> 01:13:14,723
so well for that lady.

1407
01:13:14,724 --> 01:13:16,433
- Well, thank you
for your cooperation.

1408
01:13:16,434 --> 01:13:18,602
Here's my card.

1409
01:13:18,603 --> 01:13:20,122
Give me a call if you happen
to remember anything.

1410
01:13:20,146 --> 01:13:21,397
- I will.
Thank you, officer.

1411
01:13:21,606 --> 01:13:22,565
Have a good night.

1412
01:13:22,566 --> 01:13:26,026
- You do the same.

1413
01:13:26,027 --> 01:13:28,278
[Phone ringing]

1414
01:13:28,279 --> 01:13:29,780
- I thought I told you never
call me on this number.

1415
01:13:29,781 --> 01:13:30,490
- Where is she, man?

1416
01:13:30,491 --> 01:13:32,157
This is taking too long.

1417
01:13:32,158 --> 01:13:33,367
- Look, take a deep breath.

1418
01:13:33,368 --> 01:13:34,493
She'll be there in a minute.

1419
01:13:34,494 --> 01:13:35,453
Just relax.

a hitch, so you just make sure

01:13:40,041 --> 01:13:41,750
you have the other half of my
money, and don't you ever call

It was a little snafu.

ran into a little snafu?

Paulie hangs out.

I used to make deliveries
behind the dumpster.

No one suspected a homeless
lady pushing a shopping cart

So punkin's would call, and then
Paulie would come and

1447
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,427
he'd pick them up.

to one other place.

1453
01:14:41,853 --> 01:14:43,770

What is she, dead?
