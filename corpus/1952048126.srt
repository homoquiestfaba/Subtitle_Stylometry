1
00:03:49,409 --> 00:03:52,708
So hoW are things going with you?

2
00:03:52,779 --> 00:03:54,303
Well, everything was going great

3
00:03:54,381 --> 00:03:56,042
until they opened
that Ta-Ta's next door.

4
00:03:56,116 --> 00:03:57,549
They've been taking
a lot of my business,

5
00:03:57,617 --> 00:03:58,879
some of my best girls.

6
00:03:58,952 --> 00:04:03,719
But the district manager
got paralyzed from bad shellfish.

7
00:04:03,790 --> 00:04:05,280
Guess who's next in line.

8
00:04:05,358 --> 00:04:06,825
I think I'm getting a little bored.

9
00:04:06,893 --> 00:04:09,589
Guess who stopped by yesterday.

10
00:04:09,663 --> 00:04:10,755
Who?

11
00:04:10,830 --> 00:04:12,457
Mrs. Silverman and her son.

12
00:04:12,532 --> 00:04:14,022
Tom. Hey, hoW is Tom?

13
00:04:14,100 --> 00:04:15,260
Oh, good, good.

14
00:04:15,335 --> 00:04:17,530
He was with his beautiful pregnant wife.

15
00:04:18,572 --> 00:04:19,664
Is that so?

16
00:04:19,739 --> 00:04:23,675
You don't really have
a beautiful pregnant wife.

17
00:04:23,743 --> 00:04:25,677
Nope. Sure don't.

18
00:04:25,745 --> 00:04:29,476
You don't even have a bastard child
With an ugly woman out of wedlock.

19
00:04:29,549 --> 00:04:32,279
Mom, he's paralyzed.

20
00:04:32,352 --> 00:04:34,820
That means I'm next. Okay?

21
00:04:34,888 --> 00:04:36,947
That means I'm district manager.

22
00:04:37,023 --> 00:04:38,581
Things around here
are going to change.

23
00:04:38,658 --> 00:04:41,821
Just like they were going to change
When you became restaurant manager.

24
00:04:43,430 --> 00:04:44,624
Good-bye.

25
00:04:53,373 --> 00:04:54,863
Look, honey,

26
00:04:54,941 --> 00:04:58,502
I care about you way too much
to let you work there,

27
00:04:58,578 --> 00:05:00,546
so I'm going to have
to put my foot doWn.

28
00:05:00,614 --> 00:05:01,911
Cool. You do that.

29
00:05:01,982 --> 00:05:06,009
Allison, listen, I don't want you
to be groped inappropriately,

30
00:05:06,086 --> 00:05:07,713
except by me.

31
00:05:07,787 --> 00:05:09,448
Come on.

32
00:05:09,522 --> 00:05:10,853
It's a gateWay job.

33
00:05:10,924 --> 00:05:12,721
Yeah.

34
00:05:13,827 --> 00:05:15,795
What the fuck?

35
00:05:15,862 --> 00:05:18,695
You'll be working a stripper pole
Within a year!

36
00:05:18,765 --> 00:05:23,168
You're going to be a young mother
With lots of dollars in your poosWah!

37
00:05:39,853 --> 00:05:41,150
What's up, stranger?

38
00:05:41,221 --> 00:05:43,052
Oh, my God! Hi.

39
00:05:43,123 --> 00:05:45,353
Hi, honey. Baby doll.

40
00:05:45,425 --> 00:05:47,290
Oh, my gosh.
So today's the big day, huh?

41
00:05:47,360 --> 00:05:50,261
Yeah. I finally took the plunge.

42
00:05:50,330 --> 00:05:51,763
Well, do you want the grand tour?

43
00:05:51,831 --> 00:05:53,093
- Yes, please.
- Okay.

44
00:05:53,166 --> 00:05:55,430
I've never worked
in a place like this before.

45
00:05:56,836 --> 00:05:58,360
You'll be fine.

46
00:05:58,438 --> 00:06:00,565
- You knoW. Come on.
- Okay.

47
00:06:34,174 --> 00:06:35,801
Hey, Josh.

48
00:06:35,875 --> 00:06:38,605
- Josh.
- Hey. Uh...

49
00:06:38,678 --> 00:06:40,805
Man, you look like unshaven shit.

50
00:06:40,880 --> 00:06:42,142
Thank you, Amber. Thanks.

51
00:06:42,215 --> 00:06:44,080
You're making a big deal
out of nothing.

52
00:06:44,150 --> 00:06:45,208
It's not nothing. I'm haunted.

53
00:06:45,285 --> 00:06:46,912
<i>Every night, I have
the same weeds dream.</i>

54
00:06:46,986 --> 00:06:48,214
Everything starts off great,

55
00:06:48,288 --> 00:06:50,222
and then I get set, like,
four tables all at once.

56
00:06:50,290 --> 00:06:51,484
Hey, there, folks.

57
00:06:51,558 --> 00:06:53,082
- I'll have a Pepsi.
- Okay, Pepsi.

58
00:06:53,159 --> 00:06:54,353
She'll have a sWeet tea.

59
00:06:54,427 --> 00:06:56,657
HoW about raspberry tea?
Is that all right?

60
00:06:56,730 --> 00:06:57,890
HoW about no?

61
00:06:57,964 --> 00:06:59,124
- Hot tea.
- Okay, hot tea.

62
00:06:59,199 --> 00:07:00,291
We're catching a movie,

63
00:07:00,366 --> 00:07:02,300
so we need you to rush
our order, okay?

64
00:07:02,368 --> 00:07:03,460
Excuse me!

65
00:07:03,536 --> 00:07:04,969
Uh, just one second. Yes?

66
00:07:05,038 --> 00:07:06,300
What's your fish of the day?

67
00:07:06,372 --> 00:07:07,703
We don't have a fish of the day.

68
00:07:07,774 --> 00:07:09,298
- Did I say decaf?
- Yeah.

69
00:07:09,375 --> 00:07:11,036
We haven't looked at the menu yet.

70
00:07:11,111 --> 00:07:12,703
If I get the salad bar with my steak...

71
00:07:12,779 --> 00:07:14,576
What is that, German?

72
00:07:14,647 --> 00:07:15,944
I need a steak well-done!

73
00:07:16,015 --> 00:07:18,176
The printer ran out of ink.

74
00:07:18,251 --> 00:07:19,513
Whatever.

75
00:07:19,586 --> 00:07:20,985
There's a problem in the kitchen.

76
00:07:21,054 --> 00:07:22,419
All the orders were deleted, okay?

77
00:07:22,489 --> 00:07:23,547
Oh, my God.

78
00:07:23,623 --> 00:07:25,420
Are you kidding me?

79
00:07:25,492 --> 00:07:27,323
I want the salad bar.

80
00:07:28,762 --> 00:07:31,230
Then I end up naked in front
of the entire restaurant.

81
00:07:31,297 --> 00:07:33,197
You're a vagina.

82
00:07:33,266 --> 00:07:35,632
You've just been working too hard.

83
00:07:35,702 --> 00:07:37,033
Whatever.

84
00:07:44,611 --> 00:07:46,670
Hey.

85
00:07:46,746 --> 00:07:48,145
Miguel,

86
00:07:48,214 --> 00:07:49,909
that's more than 3 ounces
of cheese, my friend.

87
00:07:49,983 --> 00:07:51,746
We talked about this before.

88
00:07:51,818 --> 00:07:53,547
<i>Less queso.</i>

89
00:07:53,620 --> 00:07:55,383
More listen-o.

90
00:08:00,493 --> 00:08:03,462
Okay, Allison. All right.

91
00:08:03,530 --> 00:08:05,293
First thing we need to do
is get you an outfit.

92
00:08:05,365 --> 00:08:06,923
Okay?

93
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:09,935
Uh, sizes are small, extra small,

94
00:08:10,003 --> 00:08:11,163
and extra extra small.

95
00:08:11,237 --> 00:08:13,228
Oh, uh, extra small?

96
00:08:14,841 --> 00:08:16,809
Then you probably want
to wear an extra extra small

97
00:08:16,876 --> 00:08:19,436
because management likes
your ass to hang out a little.

98
00:08:19,512 --> 00:08:20,979
And by a little, I mean a lot.

99
00:08:22,849 --> 00:08:24,407
Cute.

100
00:08:24,484 --> 00:08:25,416
Oh, no jeWelry.

101
00:08:25,485 --> 00:08:26,509
Sorry.

102
00:08:26,586 --> 00:08:28,918
Yeah, management says
it makes you look trashy.

103
00:08:28,988 --> 00:08:30,216
But...

104
00:08:30,290 --> 00:08:32,087
But they have approved nipple rings.

105
00:08:32,158 --> 00:08:33,921
I don't knoW if that helps.

106
00:08:33,993 --> 00:08:36,757
Uh, you get 50 percent off food,
except for desserts.

107
00:08:36,830 --> 00:08:38,058
I guess that's about it.

108
00:08:38,131 --> 00:08:41,191
Just, um, saddle up.

109
00:08:41,267 --> 00:08:42,859
Cool.

110
00:08:45,071 --> 00:08:47,869
- Here? I m... noW?
- Yeah.

111
00:08:47,941 --> 00:08:49,533
If you have any questions
about anything,

112
00:08:49,609 --> 00:08:50,803
to squeeze in anything...

113
00:08:50,877 --> 00:08:52,037
You'll be right there.

114
00:08:52,111 --> 00:08:54,375
...tuck anything in
or pull anything out.

115
00:08:54,447 --> 00:08:56,881
Yeah, I... I think I'm good.

116
00:08:56,950 --> 00:08:58,315
I think I'm good.

117
00:08:58,384 --> 00:08:59,715
Okay.

118
00:09:00,887 --> 00:09:03,117
Okay, Miguel,

119
00:09:03,189 --> 00:09:04,622
if you're going to step up

120
00:09:04,691 --> 00:09:06,056
and work under me on Friday night,

121
00:09:06,125 --> 00:09:07,854
<i>- you got to keep your cool, okay?
- Yes, ese.</i>

122
00:09:07,927 --> 00:09:10,794
Friday's the hardest part
of the job during the rush

123
00:09:10,864 --> 00:09:12,855
because we also have
to do all the toasting.

124
00:09:12,932 --> 00:09:15,264
And all the fucking
French onion soups,

125
00:09:15,335 --> 00:09:18,930
Which, as you can imagine,
is pretty time-consuming.

126
00:09:19,005 --> 00:09:20,472
NoW, we get it all, okay?

127
00:09:20,540 --> 00:09:21,871
So when the shit hits the fan,

128
00:09:21,941 --> 00:09:24,603
and it's going to hit the fan, Miguel,

129
00:09:24,677 --> 00:09:26,269
you better not freak out
or something. All right?

130
00:09:26,346 --> 00:09:27,574
A lot of people can't hack this.

131
00:09:27,647 --> 00:09:28,705
<i>Sí, sí. I knoW, ese.</i>

132
00:09:28,781 --> 00:09:31,716
And you better have
a sense of humor tonight.

133
00:09:31,784 --> 00:09:33,411
Okay?

134
00:09:33,486 --> 00:09:35,977
If I start screWing with you, just...

135
00:09:36,055 --> 00:09:37,147
joking around or something like that,

136
00:09:37,223 --> 00:09:39,350
or if you mess up and I call you on it,

137
00:09:39,425 --> 00:09:42,417
don't run off and pussy out
and start whining.

138
00:09:42,495 --> 00:09:45,191
You got to have a pretty thick skin
if you want to work with me.

139
00:09:45,265 --> 00:09:46,357
Seriously.

140
00:09:46,432 --> 00:09:48,627
Sour cream Sanchez!

141
00:09:48,701 --> 00:09:50,635
Olé!

142
00:09:53,139 --> 00:09:54,401
See, all over his...

143
00:09:54,474 --> 00:09:56,999
Ahh, he makes me laugh.

144
00:10:19,132 --> 00:10:20,827
Hey, Natasha.

145
00:10:20,900 --> 00:10:22,595
You're looking sexier
than a bag of tits.

146
00:10:22,669 --> 00:10:25,137
Thanks, AgneW. So are you.

147
00:10:25,204 --> 00:10:28,002
Are you still dating Allison,
or can you see other people?

148
00:10:28,074 --> 00:10:29,564
Who?

149
00:10:29,642 --> 00:10:30,734
No, I can...

150
00:10:30,810 --> 00:10:32,209
I can see whoever I want.

151
00:10:32,278 --> 00:10:35,509
Speaking of, what time
you getting off tonight?

152
00:10:35,581 --> 00:10:37,947
Actually, I'm getting off right noW.

153
00:10:38,017 --> 00:10:39,450
I'm not working tonight.

154
00:10:39,519 --> 00:10:41,350
Man, that sucks.

155
00:10:41,421 --> 00:10:46,358
Because wouldn't it be great
if we were getting off simultaneously.

156
00:10:46,426 --> 00:10:47,893
Don't worry.

157
00:10:47,961 --> 00:10:49,394
You'll get off soon enough.

158
00:10:49,462 --> 00:10:50,520
Okay, we get it.

159
00:10:50,596 --> 00:10:52,359
You tWo want to fuck each other.

160
00:10:52,432 --> 00:10:53,729
Natasha,

161
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,427
go be a whore elseWhere, okay?

162
00:10:55,501 --> 00:10:56,627
AgneW...

163
00:10:56,703 --> 00:10:58,261
go plot your next date rape in the kitchen,

164
00:10:58,338 --> 00:10:59,896
or your station's going
to be empty all night.

165
00:10:59,973 --> 00:11:02,965
- Hello, Naomi.
- Hello, Fuck Boy.

166
00:11:03,042 --> 00:11:06,034
Hey. You got everything you need?

167
00:11:06,112 --> 00:11:08,239
Good one. All right.

168
00:11:08,314 --> 00:11:10,043
Hey, Hank. Heard you had
a little b-day shindig.

169
00:11:10,116 --> 00:11:11,879
- HoW it was?
- It was all right.

170
00:11:11,951 --> 00:11:13,782
Just a feW peeps over
at the apartment complex.

171
00:11:13,853 --> 00:11:15,252
Uh, any hot chickens there?

172
00:11:15,321 --> 00:11:16,481
Or was it a pud party?

173
00:11:16,556 --> 00:11:18,615
There was a feW cuties.

174
00:11:18,691 --> 00:11:20,386
Amber and Kristy sWung by.
That was nice.

175
00:11:20,460 --> 00:11:22,155
Oh, really? Uh, oh.

176
00:11:22,228 --> 00:11:23,388
Well, sorry I couldn't make it.

177
00:11:23,463 --> 00:11:26,557
I couldn't, uh, be invited.

178
00:11:31,537 --> 00:11:34,199
Uh, listen, Hank,

179
00:11:34,273 --> 00:11:36,935
Would you mind
pushing top shelf tonight?

180
00:11:37,010 --> 00:11:39,001
And, uh, go easy on the elboW.

181
00:11:39,078 --> 00:11:41,410
I got a bunch of half-naked chicks next door.

182
00:11:41,481 --> 00:11:44,507
They are haWking hot wings
and camel toes.

183
00:12:03,169 --> 00:12:05,501
Hey, come here, little lady.

184
00:12:05,571 --> 00:12:06,833
Where you going?

185
00:12:06,906 --> 00:12:08,874
- Give me a tWirl.
- Yeah.

186
00:12:08,941 --> 00:12:11,834
Very nice.

187
00:12:11,911 --> 00:12:13,503
Seriously, if I were still in my bi phase,

188
00:12:13,579 --> 00:12:15,604
I would eat your ass like a sandWich.

189
00:12:15,681 --> 00:12:17,012
What?

190
00:12:17,083 --> 00:12:19,074
Gotcha.

191
00:12:19,152 --> 00:12:20,983
I'm still in that bi phase.

192
00:12:21,054 --> 00:12:24,319
Raddimus,
have you met Allison yet?

193
00:12:24,390 --> 00:12:28,121
Oh, hoW can I forget that?

194
00:12:30,730 --> 00:12:32,197
No, I don't think we've met.

195
00:12:32,265 --> 00:12:34,392
I'm Raddimus. Hi.

196
00:12:34,467 --> 00:12:35,957
So it's her first day, and I got to jet.

197
00:12:36,035 --> 00:12:38,094
Could you shoW her
around the kitchen for me?

198
00:12:38,171 --> 00:12:39,331
Oh, love to.

199
00:12:39,405 --> 00:12:40,838
- Thank you.
- Love to. Yeah.

200
00:12:40,907 --> 00:12:42,067
ShoW 'em what you got.

201
00:12:42,141 --> 00:12:43,472
- Okay.
- Okay, baby.

202
00:12:43,543 --> 00:12:47,604
Okay. The grill's over there,
the freezer's over there,

203
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,705
and the pick-up area is right there.

204
00:12:49,782 --> 00:12:51,613
Great. Cool.

205
00:12:51,684 --> 00:12:53,811
Got that. Anything else I should knoW?

206
00:12:53,886 --> 00:12:54,978
No, not really.

207
00:12:57,190 --> 00:12:58,748
Oh, yeah.

208
00:12:58,825 --> 00:12:59,883
There is one thing.

209
00:13:03,262 --> 00:13:06,527
Did Hailey tell you about
this little game we play around here?

210
00:13:08,734 --> 00:13:09,928
No.

211
00:13:10,002 --> 00:13:11,970
Oh. Okay.

212
00:13:12,038 --> 00:13:14,199
Let's play.

213
00:13:15,241 --> 00:13:17,004
I don't knoW.

214
00:13:17,076 --> 00:13:18,236
We'll do a little stretching first.

215
00:13:18,311 --> 00:13:19,437
Jesus.

216
00:13:19,512 --> 00:13:21,139
Come on, baby.

217
00:13:21,214 --> 00:13:24,012
Call me crazy, I might be.

218
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:27,109
One time I fucked a tiger
With my right knee.

219
00:13:27,186 --> 00:13:30,280
Suck a coW's tits.
Suck a coW's tits.

220
00:13:30,356 --> 00:13:33,086
You can't suck her dick
'cause a coW is a chick.

221
00:13:33,159 --> 00:13:34,456
What's up, Nick?

222
00:13:34,527 --> 00:13:36,995
What's up, T-doggie doggie daWg?

223
00:13:37,063 --> 00:13:38,826
My name is Theo.

224
00:13:38,898 --> 00:13:40,058
Quit acting like that.

225
00:13:40,133 --> 00:13:42,226
Come on, nigga.
You alWays be my T-daWg, right?

226
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:45,099
You knoW, white kids acting black,
that's so passé.

227
00:13:45,171 --> 00:13:47,105
Shit was passé when we did it.

228
00:13:47,173 --> 00:13:48,470
Let it go.

229
00:13:49,809 --> 00:13:51,299
Bitch.

230
00:13:51,377 --> 00:13:54,437
The next position is called the clitar.

231
00:13:54,514 --> 00:13:55,606
You take your panties...

232
00:13:55,681 --> 00:13:57,171
NoW, are you left-handed
or right-handed?

233
00:13:57,250 --> 00:13:58,683
Right. Right-handed.

234
00:13:58,751 --> 00:14:00,343
Right on.

235
00:14:01,354 --> 00:14:02,844
So then you go... all right, baby?

236
00:14:02,922 --> 00:14:05,618
Then you just start jamming
like Stevie Ray Vaughan.

237
00:14:10,696 --> 00:14:11,822
Raddimus!

238
00:14:11,898 --> 00:14:14,799
Nobody's going to play
your stupid vagina game.

239
00:14:14,867 --> 00:14:17,301
All right? Give it up.

240
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:23,768
Hey, Dan, uh,

241
00:14:23,843 --> 00:14:25,606
corporate didn't mention you were com...

242
00:14:25,678 --> 00:14:26,838
Uh, come on in, man.

243
00:14:26,913 --> 00:14:28,938
I was just, uh, going over
some figures here.

244
00:14:29,015 --> 00:14:30,915
Perfect. That's what I
came to talk to you about.

245
00:14:30,983 --> 00:14:32,883
Seems we haven't gotten
your numbers in a feW weeks.

246
00:14:32,952 --> 00:14:34,044
Everything on track?

247
00:14:34,120 --> 00:14:36,111
My numbers? They're good.

248
00:14:36,189 --> 00:14:37,349
They're excellent.

249
00:14:37,423 --> 00:14:39,721
Hoo, that is a relief
because you knoW corporate.

250
00:14:39,792 --> 00:14:41,726
- They're all about the numbers.
- Yeah, man.

251
00:14:41,794 --> 00:14:45,025
Especially with that district manager job
up for grabs.

252
00:14:45,097 --> 00:14:48,498
Well, it's a good thing
my numbers are so good, then.

253
00:14:48,568 --> 00:14:49,728
Yeah, let's just have a look.

254
00:14:49,802 --> 00:14:50,894
No, they're not finalized yet.

255
00:14:50,970 --> 00:14:52,733
I don't want to steal
my oWn thunder, man.

256
00:14:52,805 --> 00:14:55,000
Let's just have a little
peek at the thunder, huh?

257
00:14:55,074 --> 00:14:56,632
It's no...

258
00:15:01,747 --> 00:15:04,375
I'm going to make my numbers
this weekend, Dan.

259
00:15:04,450 --> 00:15:07,146
Come on, man. I've got 9 Gs to go.

260
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,881
Yeah. That's great.

261
00:15:08,955 --> 00:15:10,946
Doesn't the quarter end tonight?

262
00:15:12,658 --> 00:15:13,682
Yeah.

263
00:15:13,759 --> 00:15:14,783
Come on, Dan.

264
00:15:14,860 --> 00:15:16,589
We used to make our numbers all the time

265
00:15:16,662 --> 00:15:18,596
before you guys opened
that titty bar next door.

266
00:15:18,664 --> 00:15:20,393
Titty bar makes numbers, babe.

267
00:15:20,466 --> 00:15:22,400
They do what it takes to win.

268
00:15:22,468 --> 00:15:24,265
NoW, if you don't want to play it tough,

269
00:15:24,337 --> 00:15:26,464
We'll just give that district
to the manager next door.

270
00:15:26,539 --> 00:15:27,699
He's a hot shot.

271
00:15:35,815 --> 00:15:37,680
This is not my office.

272
00:15:37,750 --> 00:15:39,308
HoW'd you get in here?

273
00:15:39,385 --> 00:15:42,320
That tickle? Are you
going to press charges?

274
00:15:42,388 --> 00:15:44,379
Wait. Come back.

275
00:15:58,537 --> 00:15:59,731
Oh, Allison.

276
00:15:59,805 --> 00:16:01,466
What's up?

277
00:16:01,540 --> 00:16:03,838
What a gorgeous day to start.

278
00:16:03,909 --> 00:16:05,103
You look amazing.

279
00:16:05,177 --> 00:16:06,701
Come. walk with me.

280
00:16:06,779 --> 00:16:08,508
HoW long has it been
since we worked together?

281
00:16:08,581 --> 00:16:09,707
Like, tWo years?

282
00:16:09,782 --> 00:16:11,613
Oh, my God. A lot's changed in those years.

283
00:16:11,684 --> 00:16:13,151
Hey, ladies.

284
00:16:17,156 --> 00:16:18,214
Hey, don't be jealous.

285
00:16:18,291 --> 00:16:19,451
Seriously, it's so unattractive.

286
00:16:19,525 --> 00:16:20,685
You're going to love working here.

287
00:16:20,760 --> 00:16:21,886
The tips are great.

288
00:16:21,961 --> 00:16:23,588
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey, beautiful.

289
00:16:23,663 --> 00:16:25,654
And your boss is a push-over.

290
00:16:30,369 --> 00:16:31,734
We're like one big, happy family.

291
00:16:31,804 --> 00:16:33,772
You knoW, I'm the father,
and you're my daughters.

292
00:16:33,839 --> 00:16:37,070
Well, you knoW, step-daughters.

293
00:16:37,143 --> 00:16:39,202
- whoa. Things really have changed.
- Yeah.

294
00:16:39,278 --> 00:16:40,404
- Cal.
- Yo.

295
00:16:40,479 --> 00:16:42,379
Can I get you to approve
this schedule change for me?

296
00:16:42,448 --> 00:16:44,006
- Autograph?
- Oh, you're the best.

297
00:16:44,083 --> 00:16:45,175
You got it, sWeetie.

298
00:16:45,251 --> 00:16:46,741
Hey, gorgeous!

299
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,446
Josh, you just got to come to a shoW.

300
00:16:48,521 --> 00:16:49,613
You won't believe it.

301
00:16:49,689 --> 00:16:53,147
I'm starting to dance, which is tricky
because of the height thing.

302
00:16:53,225 --> 00:16:55,193
But because of the balance,
I'm not tipping anymore.

303
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,525
I'm just boom, standing tall.

304
00:16:57,596 --> 00:17:00,224
Hey, old man, did you fuck
that lady last night?

305
00:17:00,299 --> 00:17:01,960
You knoW, the one with
the freckles on her chest?

306
00:17:02,034 --> 00:17:03,433
I bet you did, huh?

307
00:17:03,502 --> 00:17:04,901
Did you fishhook her?

308
00:17:04,970 --> 00:17:06,938
Did you give her the four-finger spread?

309
00:17:07,006 --> 00:17:08,871
Did you spit...
Let me smell your moustache.

310
00:17:08,941 --> 00:17:10,533
Did you get it in there?

311
00:17:12,011 --> 00:17:13,535
Did you spit on it?

312
00:17:15,915 --> 00:17:17,041
What happened?

313
00:17:17,116 --> 00:17:18,242
Don't worry about it.

314
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:20,751
You knoW what? I'm actually thinking
about getting out of this racket.

315
00:17:20,820 --> 00:17:23,345
Start concentrating
on the band full-time.

316
00:17:23,422 --> 00:17:24,684
Oh, the band.

317
00:17:24,757 --> 00:17:26,657
Well, you'd better
get cracking there, Old Man River.

318
00:17:26,726 --> 00:17:28,990
I'm actually getting a lot of paying gigs.

319
00:17:29,061 --> 00:17:30,858
The MySpace getting tons of hits.

320
00:17:30,930 --> 00:17:32,158
Got, like, 500 friends.

321
00:17:32,231 --> 00:17:33,630
This guy dropped a virus on there

322
00:17:33,699 --> 00:17:35,792
so when you click, you hear my music.

323
00:17:35,868 --> 00:17:37,301
- A virus?
- Hello.

324
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:39,361
What about all the poon
you've nailed here?

325
00:17:39,438 --> 00:17:41,372
I mean, who's going
to fuck all the cougars?

326
00:17:41,440 --> 00:17:43,408
Life's not just about nailing poon, bro.

327
00:17:43,476 --> 00:17:45,239
Uh, Dr. Faggot,

328
00:17:45,311 --> 00:17:47,871
your cock seems to be parked
in another man's asshole.

329
00:17:49,148 --> 00:17:50,410
Why are you such a dick?

330
00:17:50,483 --> 00:17:52,849
Don't ask.

331
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:55,148
So what have you
and your little boyfriends

332
00:17:55,221 --> 00:17:56,552
been up to lately?

333
00:17:56,622 --> 00:17:57,884
Dad, I told you.

334
00:17:57,957 --> 00:17:59,117
We're not gay,

335
00:17:59,191 --> 00:18:01,250
We're just a couple
of open-minded guys.

336
00:18:01,327 --> 00:18:03,454
My son, the rope-sucker.

337
00:18:03,529 --> 00:18:04,461
Yeah.

338
00:18:04,530 --> 00:18:05,963
You knoW,

339
00:18:06,031 --> 00:18:08,192
I blame the failure
of our marriage on you.

340
00:18:08,267 --> 00:18:09,359
SWeet.

341
00:18:09,435 --> 00:18:10,561
When I knocked your mom up,

342
00:18:10,636 --> 00:18:13,332
I told her I'd do the honorable thing
and pay for the abortion.

343
00:18:13,406 --> 00:18:14,464
And she was like,

344
00:18:14,540 --> 00:18:16,599
"Oh, I think I want
to have this baby. "

345
00:18:16,675 --> 00:18:19,940
And I was like, "Bitch,
you are having it tonight. "

346
00:18:21,013 --> 00:18:22,605
It's coat hanger o'clock.

347
00:18:22,681 --> 00:18:25,013
- Good one.
- Good one.

348
00:18:29,021 --> 00:18:31,421
Ta-Ta's isn't going aWay, Dennis.

349
00:18:31,490 --> 00:18:32,980
You got to learn to fight scrappy.

350
00:18:33,058 --> 00:18:36,118
It's hard to be scrappy
When half my girls are over there noW.

351
00:18:36,195 --> 00:18:37,662
I got nothing on the floor but dudes.

352
00:18:37,730 --> 00:18:39,595
It's like a Viking ship.

353
00:18:41,033 --> 00:18:42,864
And I'm trying to have a kid, man.

354
00:18:45,404 --> 00:18:46,735
Hey.

355
00:18:48,207 --> 00:18:50,038
She's a babe.

356
00:18:50,109 --> 00:18:51,804
It's... That's... I...

357
00:18:51,877 --> 00:18:53,174
She came with the frame.

358
00:18:53,245 --> 00:18:54,906
Sad.

359
00:18:54,980 --> 00:18:56,572
No girl is going to get interested in me

360
00:18:56,649 --> 00:18:58,173
if I'm a store manager
in a strip mall.

361
00:18:58,250 --> 00:18:59,979
I mean, your wife didn't
get interested in you

362
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:01,576
until you were a district manager.

363
00:19:01,654 --> 00:19:03,144
I'm better-looking than you.

364
00:19:05,724 --> 00:19:07,521
You picked a terrible time to screW up.

365
00:19:07,593 --> 00:19:08,924
Shull is in toWn.

366
00:19:08,994 --> 00:19:10,689
The regional manager?

367
00:19:10,763 --> 00:19:12,253
Shitty puppy.

368
00:19:12,331 --> 00:19:13,593
Yeah.

369
00:19:13,666 --> 00:19:16,897
AW, come on. This is ridiculous.

370
00:19:16,969 --> 00:19:18,800
He's looking to make
an example out of someone.

371
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:22,136
Your Shenaniganz got closed
for culinary general contact.

372
00:19:22,208 --> 00:19:23,505
Tone.

373
00:19:23,576 --> 00:19:25,100
You just got to help me
get this promotion.

374
00:19:25,177 --> 00:19:27,270
Jesus, Dennis.

375
00:19:27,346 --> 00:19:30,315
Try to have some dignity.

376
00:19:30,382 --> 00:19:32,646
Don't talk to me about dignity!

377
00:19:32,718 --> 00:19:35,881
You ever have a whole fraternity
shit on your chest?

378
00:19:35,955 --> 00:19:37,923
And then not let you in?

379
00:19:37,990 --> 00:19:40,584
Not a fraternity, no.

380
00:19:40,659 --> 00:19:44,993
The bottom line,
if you don't hit your numbers,

381
00:19:45,064 --> 00:19:47,658
if you don't have a $9,000 day,

382
00:19:47,733 --> 00:19:49,701
you will not get
that district manager job.

383
00:19:51,403 --> 00:19:54,133
All right, I'm going to be totally honest
With you.

384
00:19:54,206 --> 00:19:58,370
If we don't hit our numbers,
if we don't make a $9,000 day,

385
00:19:58,444 --> 00:20:02,608
then the restaurant is shutting doWn.

386
00:20:02,681 --> 00:20:03,739
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.

387
00:20:03,816 --> 00:20:04,976
- what?
- DoWn?

388
00:20:05,050 --> 00:20:06,415
If we're gonna be short
a feW thousand dollars,

389
00:20:06,485 --> 00:20:07,713
they're gonna shut us doWn?

390
00:20:07,786 --> 00:20:08,946
That doesn't make any sense!

391
00:20:09,021 --> 00:20:10,921
It's a senseless crime.

392
00:20:10,990 --> 00:20:12,423
That's corporate for you.

393
00:20:12,491 --> 00:20:13,651
They'll shut you doWn like that.

394
00:20:13,726 --> 00:20:15,523
We've never come close to 9 grand.

395
00:20:15,594 --> 00:20:17,494
Hey, if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be, right?

396
00:20:17,563 --> 00:20:18,825
Hey, hey. Hold on.

397
00:20:18,898 --> 00:20:20,331
Let me tell you a little story.

398
00:20:22,501 --> 00:20:24,332
1983, it's the play-offs.

399
00:20:24,403 --> 00:20:26,997
We're facing the toughest team
in the whole high school region.

400
00:20:27,072 --> 00:20:29,040
They only had, like, tWo white guys.

401
00:20:29,108 --> 00:20:30,632
Who gives a shit, Dennis?

402
00:20:30,709 --> 00:20:32,472
If he put me in, I would've
fought like a fairy...

403
00:20:32,545 --> 00:20:33,978
Dennis, he doesn't put
the male cheerleader in.

404
00:20:34,046 --> 00:20:36,071
If he had put the male cheerleader in,

405
00:20:36,148 --> 00:20:38,514
then I would've tried like the dickens

406
00:20:38,584 --> 00:20:40,381
to get that ball into the end zone,

407
00:20:40,452 --> 00:20:41,612
and so must all of you...

408
00:20:41,687 --> 00:20:44,349
all of us tonight do so also.

409
00:20:44,423 --> 00:20:46,015
I'm putting a lot
of promotions into effect.

410
00:20:46,091 --> 00:20:48,025
I'm going to get
the early evening menu going.

411
00:20:48,093 --> 00:20:49,560
I understand.

412
00:20:49,628 --> 00:20:51,323
The elderly aren't the greatest tippers,

413
00:20:51,397 --> 00:20:52,921
but I'm telling you,
they're going to give us

414
00:20:52,998 --> 00:20:54,795
the most beautiful afternoon pop

415
00:20:54,867 --> 00:20:57,597
right before the dinner rush, okay?

416
00:20:57,670 --> 00:20:58,762
And please remember,

417
00:20:58,837 --> 00:21:00,031
the...

418
00:21:00,105 --> 00:21:01,902
- what's that?
... effect.

419
00:21:01,974 --> 00:21:03,999
- Thumb fight?
- The butterfly effect.

420
00:21:04,076 --> 00:21:05,737
I told you about the butterfly effect.

421
00:21:05,811 --> 00:21:07,301
One little thing goes wrong,

422
00:21:07,379 --> 00:21:08,971
the whole floW of the restaurant goes out.

423
00:21:09,048 --> 00:21:10,310
And I'll tell you one thing.

424
00:21:10,382 --> 00:21:12,816
Austin Kutchner wasn't
kidding around in that movie.

425
00:21:12,885 --> 00:21:14,443
Kootchman?

426
00:21:14,520 --> 00:21:16,147
You knoW who I'm talking about.

427
00:21:16,221 --> 00:21:18,519
- who?
- Ashman Kitchnens.

428
00:21:18,591 --> 00:21:20,183
He wasn't bullshitting.

429
00:21:20,259 --> 00:21:21,749
End of meeting.

430
00:21:21,827 --> 00:21:23,761
Oh, one more thing.

431
00:21:23,829 --> 00:21:25,160
Inappropriate language
in front of the guests.

432
00:21:25,230 --> 00:21:27,528
Oh, that guy's a dick.

433
00:21:27,600 --> 00:21:29,158
Come on, come on. I do it, too.

434
00:21:29,234 --> 00:21:32,567
I say shit and ass and pud
as much as the next guy,

435
00:21:32,638 --> 00:21:34,936
but not at a 9-year-old's birthday party.

436
00:21:35,007 --> 00:21:36,668
Clean it up.

437
00:21:36,742 --> 00:21:39,836
I am so fucked.

438
00:21:41,080 --> 00:21:42,809
Charlie, get my shin/knee.

439
00:22:10,175 --> 00:22:12,200
Welcome to Ta-Ta's.

440
00:22:12,277 --> 00:22:15,246
I've got a table waiting just for you.

441
00:22:29,561 --> 00:22:30,926
Yes.

442
00:22:33,432 --> 00:22:36,526
HoW about top-shelf for a dollar more?

443
00:22:36,602 --> 00:22:37,830
All right.

444
00:22:37,903 --> 00:22:38,995
I have a granddaughter.

445
00:22:39,071 --> 00:22:40,561
- Thank you.
- wait...

446
00:22:40,639 --> 00:22:42,607
Fucking old people.

447
00:22:42,675 --> 00:22:43,699
That's all I need.

448
00:22:43,776 --> 00:22:44,936
I don't give a shit

449
00:22:45,010 --> 00:22:47,274
that ice cream used to cost
a nickel back in your day.

450
00:22:47,346 --> 00:22:49,439
I need to get paid,
you raggedy-ass bitch.

451
00:22:59,458 --> 00:23:02,188
Hey, lactard, I think
your nachos are done.

452
00:23:08,200 --> 00:23:09,292
You're an asshole.

453
00:23:09,368 --> 00:23:11,029
I'll have a Pepsi.

454
00:23:11,103 --> 00:23:12,331
She'll have a sWeet tea.

455
00:23:12,404 --> 00:23:14,031
God.

456
00:23:15,407 --> 00:23:17,898
Uh, so, uh,

457
00:23:17,976 --> 00:23:19,500
What can I get you folks to eat?

458
00:23:19,578 --> 00:23:21,546
I'll have whatever he's having.

459
00:23:21,613 --> 00:23:22,705
Okay.

460
00:23:22,781 --> 00:23:24,408
Uh, I'll have the same.

461
00:23:24,483 --> 00:23:27,646
Medium-rare.

462
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:31,713
There are a feW
dos and don'ts here at Ta-Ta's.

463
00:23:31,790 --> 00:23:33,849
Come on.

464
00:23:33,926 --> 00:23:36,224
Whenever you send a check, okay,

465
00:23:36,295 --> 00:23:39,856
you got to go "Ta-Ta, girl. "

466
00:23:39,932 --> 00:23:41,365
- And the kitchen goes...
- Oh, yeah.

467
00:23:41,433 --> 00:23:42,491
See?

468
00:23:42,568 --> 00:23:43,865
Whenever you have a spare minute,

469
00:23:43,936 --> 00:23:47,463
management wants you,
like, dancing

470
00:23:47,539 --> 00:23:50,007
or hula hooping

471
00:23:50,075 --> 00:23:53,044
or, like, simulating
any kind of a sex act.

472
00:23:55,581 --> 00:23:56,741
NoW...

473
00:23:58,517 --> 00:24:00,576
What management
doesn't tell you is this.

474
00:24:00,652 --> 00:24:03,314
You are in a restaurant full of hot girls.

475
00:24:03,388 --> 00:24:05,788
Wars are waged, alliances are formed.

476
00:24:05,858 --> 00:24:08,952
You try to stay neutral,
you're going to get killed.

477
00:24:18,170 --> 00:24:19,501
Yes.

478
00:24:23,942 --> 00:24:25,068
Oh, man.

479
00:24:25,144 --> 00:24:27,135
I would love to "F" her in the "A,"

480
00:24:27,212 --> 00:24:30,807
and then "C" all over her "Ts. "

481
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:33,676
Well, I never.

482
00:24:33,752 --> 00:24:35,845
What? Does she work
for the CIA or something?

483
00:24:35,921 --> 00:24:37,149
HoW did she decipher that code?

484
00:24:37,222 --> 00:24:38,519
Fuck her.

485
00:24:38,590 --> 00:24:41,150
Amber. Amber, Amber, come here.

486
00:24:41,226 --> 00:24:43,023
Listen, this is kind of weird,

487
00:24:43,095 --> 00:24:46,030
but I'm thinking about...

488
00:24:46,098 --> 00:24:49,898
I've been thinking about
experimenting with homosexuality.

489
00:24:49,968 --> 00:24:51,799
And I...

490
00:24:53,472 --> 00:24:56,066
I don't think I'm gay, but you knoW,

491
00:24:56,141 --> 00:24:59,269
since you got that whole
Asian schoolboy look going on,

492
00:24:59,344 --> 00:25:02,177
I think having sex with you
Would be a good way to test the waters.

493
00:25:02,247 --> 00:25:03,214
What do you say?

494
00:25:03,282 --> 00:25:04,374
ScreW you, AgneW.

495
00:25:04,449 --> 00:25:06,212
Oh, come on. I'll make it hot for you.

496
00:25:06,285 --> 00:25:07,650
Hello, love.

497
00:25:07,719 --> 00:25:10,210
Top of the mornin' to ya.

498
00:25:10,289 --> 00:25:11,847
Biscuits and tea.

499
00:25:11,924 --> 00:25:13,323
Oh, hello, hello.

500
00:25:13,392 --> 00:25:14,518
- Naomi.
- what? what?

501
00:25:14,593 --> 00:25:16,857
You told him?
About my accent fetish?

502
00:25:16,929 --> 00:25:18,123
I was drunk.

503
00:25:18,197 --> 00:25:19,858
Why the fuck are you
telling me anything anyWay?

504
00:25:19,932 --> 00:25:21,456
Oh, so it's my fault?

505
00:25:21,533 --> 00:25:23,364
I have a drinking problem.

506
00:25:23,435 --> 00:25:27,064
And I don't intend
to do anything about it.

507
00:25:27,139 --> 00:25:29,733
Come on, moppet.
ShoW us your pink bits.

508
00:25:31,643 --> 00:25:34,134
- Those aren't real.
- Fuck off.

509
00:25:34,213 --> 00:25:36,272
Amber. Amber.

510
00:25:37,749 --> 00:25:38,909
So is it just, you knoW,

511
00:25:38,984 --> 00:25:40,975
European accents that heat up the kitty?

512
00:25:41,053 --> 00:25:43,749
I mean, what about a bartender
With a Southern draWI?

513
00:25:43,822 --> 00:25:45,414
What about an African dude going...

514
00:25:47,993 --> 00:25:49,722
I'm a speech major!

515
00:25:49,795 --> 00:25:51,990
What about, like, a Middle Eastern guy?

516
00:25:53,498 --> 00:25:54,487
- La BMW.

517
00:26:00,739 --> 00:26:02,570
Shit, man. The restaurant can't close.

518
00:26:02,641 --> 00:26:04,632
I just got a 75-cent raise.

519
00:26:04,710 --> 00:26:05,870
Finally starting to get more hours,

520
00:26:05,944 --> 00:26:07,673
starting to learn the grill.

521
00:26:07,746 --> 00:26:09,680
Can't catch a break.

522
00:26:09,748 --> 00:26:11,181
Mason, why don't you get
the fuck out of here

523
00:26:11,250 --> 00:26:13,047
and go smoke a cigarette?

524
00:26:13,118 --> 00:26:14,813
Actually, I was just about to...

525
00:26:14,887 --> 00:26:16,013
Don't argue with me, boy.

526
00:26:16,088 --> 00:26:17,146
But see,

527
00:26:17,222 --> 00:26:18,553
you're telling me to do something...

528
00:26:18,624 --> 00:26:19,852
Go out that fucking
back door right noW

529
00:26:19,925 --> 00:26:20,983
and smoke a cigarette.

530
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,390
- wait, but I...
- Don't you "but" me, boy.

531
00:26:22,461 --> 00:26:24,258
Get the fuck out of here.

532
00:26:28,700 --> 00:26:30,691
I'm leaving noW to go have a cigarette

533
00:26:30,769 --> 00:26:31,997
because I want to...

534
00:26:36,108 --> 00:26:39,134
At least they're not picking on me.

535
00:26:41,146 --> 00:26:45,048
Why can't things go back
to the way they used to be, son?

536
00:26:45,117 --> 00:26:46,948
Because that shit got old.

537
00:26:47,019 --> 00:26:48,884
Shit, it got old being
Wannabe gangsters.

538
00:26:50,155 --> 00:26:51,486
It got old when we were Goth.

539
00:26:52,824 --> 00:26:54,382
It got old when we were ravers.

540
00:26:55,560 --> 00:26:56,754
It got old through all of it.

541
00:27:00,299 --> 00:27:01,926
I mean, it was pathetic.

542
00:27:02,000 --> 00:27:03,797
I mean, we were pathetic.

543
00:27:09,007 --> 00:27:10,736
Smoking cannabis, huh?

544
00:27:10,809 --> 00:27:12,140
Fuck you.

545
00:27:13,412 --> 00:27:15,642
Fuck T-daWg.

546
00:27:18,717 --> 00:27:20,844
Thank you, sir.

547
00:27:20,919 --> 00:27:22,910
Right this way. That's right.

548
00:27:22,988 --> 00:27:24,979
There you go. That's it.
That's the out door.

549
00:27:25,057 --> 00:27:27,787
Smells like a dog took a shit in here.

550
00:27:29,294 --> 00:27:31,387
Good-bye, sir. Thanks for coming.

551
00:27:31,463 --> 00:27:32,487
Die. Die noW.

552
00:27:32,564 --> 00:27:33,588
Watch your step.

553
00:27:33,665 --> 00:27:34,689
Die-die.

554
00:27:34,766 --> 00:27:36,063
Die.

555
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:49,506
2,000 lousy dollars.

556
00:27:49,581 --> 00:27:52,948
2,000 lousy dollars?

557
00:27:54,252 --> 00:27:56,516
Those doddering,

558
00:27:56,588 --> 00:27:58,988
drooling motherfuckers.

559
00:27:59,057 --> 00:28:00,684
Hey, Dennis.

560
00:28:00,759 --> 00:28:02,056
I am being ruined, Hank,

561
00:28:02,127 --> 00:28:04,152
ruined by those sluts at Ta-Ta's

562
00:28:04,229 --> 00:28:06,925
and those pud-Wackers at corporate.

563
00:28:06,999 --> 00:28:10,435
You sure use that word pud a lot.

564
00:28:10,502 --> 00:28:12,026
What are you talking about?

565
00:28:12,104 --> 00:28:13,628
Pud. You say it a lot.

566
00:28:14,973 --> 00:28:16,167
It's a word.

567
00:28:16,241 --> 00:28:18,038
You knoW, I could take it or leave it.

568
00:28:18,110 --> 00:28:19,600
What's the matter with you?

569
00:29:33,485 --> 00:29:35,544
That's cute handWriting.

570
00:29:35,620 --> 00:29:37,212
It's all real nice. It just...

571
00:29:37,289 --> 00:29:39,849
No, I'm sorry. I just...
I don't think you're a good fit

572
00:29:39,925 --> 00:29:41,722
for our establishment here.

573
00:29:41,793 --> 00:29:45,285
These tits were chiseled by God.

574
00:29:45,363 --> 00:29:47,354
I don't think you have
the right temperament.

575
00:29:47,432 --> 00:29:50,697
You knoW what? Fuck you, Calvin.

576
00:29:50,769 --> 00:29:52,066
Oh. Okay.

577
00:29:53,171 --> 00:29:54,604
You're still a fucking dork to me.

578
00:29:54,673 --> 00:29:57,267
Good to knoW. I'll keep that in mind.

579
00:29:57,342 --> 00:29:58,331
Bye.

580
00:30:00,345 --> 00:30:01,642
- Calvin.
- Yo.

581
00:30:01,713 --> 00:30:04,773
There's this really creepy
old guy in the corner,

582
00:30:04,850 --> 00:30:06,818
and he's kind of skeeving me out.

583
00:30:06,885 --> 00:30:08,580
Oh. Okay.

584
00:30:08,653 --> 00:30:09,984
I got this.

585
00:30:16,995 --> 00:30:19,463
- Dennis?
- Hey. HoW are you?

586
00:30:19,531 --> 00:30:20,623
- HoW's it going?
- Good.

587
00:30:20,699 --> 00:30:22,360
- Pretty great.
- Okay.

588
00:30:22,434 --> 00:30:24,425
Great.

589
00:30:27,939 --> 00:30:29,930
I'm screWed.

590
00:30:33,778 --> 00:30:36,178
- Man, I love tits.
- No shit.

591
00:30:36,248 --> 00:30:38,682
I mean, hairstyles change, you knoW?

592
00:30:38,750 --> 00:30:41,048
But tits, tits never go out of style.

593
00:30:41,119 --> 00:30:42,108
That's what I'm saying.

594
00:30:42,187 --> 00:30:44,382
What do you guys think
is the best size?

595
00:30:44,456 --> 00:30:45,946
A- cup. No question.

596
00:30:48,527 --> 00:30:50,051
What a gyp to get stuck with A-cups, huh?

597
00:30:50,128 --> 00:30:51,425
No shit.

598
00:30:51,496 --> 00:30:53,487
Maybe it's even better to be flat-chested

599
00:30:53,565 --> 00:30:55,396
because then you're
not objectified as much,

600
00:30:55,467 --> 00:30:57,401
and you're taken
more seriously, you knoW?

601
00:30:58,403 --> 00:31:02,669
You're just saying that
because you have a crush on Amber.

602
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:05,335
Christ, man, you got
bigger tits than she does.

603
00:31:05,410 --> 00:31:06,877
I'd say C-cups. Definitely the best.

604
00:31:06,945 --> 00:31:08,469
No, no, no.

605
00:31:08,547 --> 00:31:10,845
You give me a pair
of some big old dirty Ds.

606
00:31:10,916 --> 00:31:12,315
Till you get them out of the bra.

607
00:31:12,384 --> 00:31:15,148
Because then all you got
is cylindrical pudding

608
00:31:15,220 --> 00:31:16,744
oozing doWn to her stomach.

609
00:31:17,956 --> 00:31:20,083
That's when you
fuck them in the pool.

610
00:31:20,158 --> 00:31:21,386
Buoyancy takes effect,

611
00:31:21,459 --> 00:31:22,687
makes them perfectly round.

612
00:31:22,761 --> 00:31:24,820
That's science.

613
00:31:24,896 --> 00:31:27,990
What do you think the girls at Ta-Ta's
talk about when it's sloW?

614
00:31:28,066 --> 00:31:30,034
Menstruation and whatnot.

615
00:31:31,269 --> 00:31:32,896
Yarn.

616
00:31:32,971 --> 00:31:35,565
The violence in the Middle East
isn't going anyWhere.

617
00:31:35,640 --> 00:31:37,608
I don't care what kind of foreign policy
We implement.

618
00:31:37,676 --> 00:31:38,870
It has nothing to do with that.

619
00:31:38,944 --> 00:31:40,036
I'm telling you,

620
00:31:40,111 --> 00:31:42,011
the men there are so sexually repressed

621
00:31:42,080 --> 00:31:43,342
because women wear those burqas.

622
00:31:43,415 --> 00:31:44,575
They never shoW their tits.

623
00:31:44,649 --> 00:31:47,243
And Middle Eastern women
have huge tits.

624
00:31:47,319 --> 00:31:49,150
Massive.

625
00:31:49,221 --> 00:31:51,155
Almost makes you want
to be Middle Eastern.

626
00:31:51,223 --> 00:31:52,850
Almost.

627
00:31:52,924 --> 00:31:54,414
I understand things are tough, man.

628
00:31:54,492 --> 00:31:56,255
HoW about a half-off dessert promotion

629
00:31:56,328 --> 00:31:57,625
With a Ta-Ta's receipt?

630
00:31:57,696 --> 00:31:59,254
Desserts have
a huge mark-up, yeah?

631
00:31:59,331 --> 00:32:00,628
- Yeah, I guess so.
- Okay, perfect.

632
00:32:00,699 --> 00:32:02,428
We will start that next month.

633
00:32:02,500 --> 00:32:04,092
I can't start it next month.

634
00:32:04,169 --> 00:32:07,730
I don't have time to start it next month!

635
00:32:07,806 --> 00:32:09,068
I'm sorry.

636
00:32:09,140 --> 00:32:11,267
My mother was right.

637
00:32:11,343 --> 00:32:14,244
I'm pushing 40, man. I'm not married.

638
00:32:14,312 --> 00:32:15,540
I don't even have any prospects.

639
00:32:15,614 --> 00:32:17,741
Yeah, I understand,
things are tough, man.

640
00:32:17,816 --> 00:32:19,181
I'm going through a bit of a crisis myself.

641
00:32:19,251 --> 00:32:20,513
- Really?
- Yeah. I'm trying to decide

642
00:32:20,585 --> 00:32:22,348
Which of those three chicks
I want to nail tonight.

643
00:32:22,420 --> 00:32:24,149
Get in the ropes,
you knoW what I mean?

644
00:32:24,222 --> 00:32:25,450
Oh, for fuck's sake.

645
00:32:25,523 --> 00:32:26,649
I'm sorry, man.

646
00:32:26,725 --> 00:32:28,124
That's me being a dick is what that is.

647
00:32:28,193 --> 00:32:29,820
- You're a dick.
- Yeah.

648
00:32:29,894 --> 00:32:31,327
Let me buy you a cup of water.

649
00:32:31,396 --> 00:32:32,761
You knoW, when I was on the fryer,

650
00:32:32,831 --> 00:32:35,265
I said to myself,
"If I could just be a server,

651
00:32:35,333 --> 00:32:37,767
I'd make enough money that
I could start getting women. "

652
00:32:37,836 --> 00:32:40,771
So I left the fryer,
and I became a server.

653
00:32:40,839 --> 00:32:42,397
- Making the money, nothing.
- Right, right.

654
00:32:42,474 --> 00:32:44,965
I said the same thing when I
Was the assistant manager,

655
00:32:45,043 --> 00:32:46,476
then store manager.

656
00:32:46,544 --> 00:32:47,476
- Nothing.
- Geez.

657
00:32:47,545 --> 00:32:48,773
Man!

658
00:32:48,847 --> 00:32:51,748
If I can just hit district manager,

659
00:32:51,816 --> 00:32:53,477
then I'll be pulling some hot trim,

660
00:32:53,551 --> 00:32:54,813
and I don't mean whores, either.

661
00:32:54,886 --> 00:32:56,444
- Hey, Cal.
- Hey, hot pants.

662
00:32:56,521 --> 00:32:57,647
Hey, you knoW what?

663
00:32:57,722 --> 00:32:59,280
Naomi said that
you weren't a ladies' man.

664
00:32:59,357 --> 00:33:01,325
That you couldn't even piss
in a public bathroom.

665
00:33:01,393 --> 00:33:03,190
That was the old me.

666
00:33:03,261 --> 00:33:04,421
Come on.

667
00:33:04,496 --> 00:33:05,895
HoW did you change?

668
00:33:05,964 --> 00:33:08,262
First thing I did was
got over my pissing phobia.

669
00:33:08,333 --> 00:33:10,927
That was the root of my problems.

670
00:33:11,002 --> 00:33:12,469
So what if some dude

671
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:13,936
checked out my schmack
in the bathroom?

672
00:33:14,005 --> 00:33:16,337
I couldn't let that turn me into a pussy.

673
00:33:17,509 --> 00:33:20,342
It's like, if I'm not man enough
to piss at a urinal with other men,

674
00:33:20,412 --> 00:33:22,471
hoW can I gonna be man enough
to take a girl's ass cherry?

675
00:33:22,547 --> 00:33:24,515
- I cannot agree more.
- Right.

676
00:33:24,582 --> 00:33:26,550
But then hoW did you get to the point

677
00:33:26,618 --> 00:33:28,085
Where you could talk to women?

678
00:33:28,153 --> 00:33:29,245
That's a good question.

679
00:33:29,321 --> 00:33:32,688
It all started when I was still a waiter
back at Shenaniganz.

680
00:33:32,757 --> 00:33:35,988
I was talking to this high school girl,
and she rejected me,

681
00:33:36,061 --> 00:33:37,619
like all of them did back in those days.

682
00:33:37,696 --> 00:33:39,061
You okay?

683
00:33:40,565 --> 00:33:42,658
Something wrong?

684
00:33:42,734 --> 00:33:43,860
So I got home,

685
00:33:43,935 --> 00:33:45,334
did a little Internet surfing.

686
00:33:45,403 --> 00:33:46,597
You knoW, just general broWsing.

687
00:33:46,671 --> 00:33:48,866
Checked the stock portfolio,

688
00:33:48,940 --> 00:33:50,100
like you do.

689
00:33:50,175 --> 00:33:52,109
And I began thinking
about my situation

690
00:33:52,177 --> 00:33:53,769
and hoW shitty everything was...

691
00:33:55,180 --> 00:33:57,273
and it really bummed me out.

692
00:33:59,517 --> 00:34:02,748
I fought through the depression
for a while.

693
00:34:03,755 --> 00:34:07,282
But ultimately,
it got the better of me,

694
00:34:07,359 --> 00:34:09,224
and I was spent.

695
00:34:14,532 --> 00:34:16,295
So, as I sat in my chair,

696
00:34:16,368 --> 00:34:17,665
depressed...

697
00:34:20,739 --> 00:34:22,366
I remembered what Monty said to me.

698
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:25,500
He said women like assholes.

699
00:34:25,577 --> 00:34:27,477
So I found this web site
that teaches the art

700
00:34:27,545 --> 00:34:29,536
of being a complete asshole to women.

701
00:34:29,614 --> 00:34:31,775
All the fundamentals.

702
00:34:31,850 --> 00:34:33,317
Women like assholes?

703
00:34:33,385 --> 00:34:34,875
And that was it.

704
00:34:34,953 --> 00:34:38,150
Yeah. I went and picked up
a copy of the DVD.

705
00:34:38,223 --> 00:34:40,020
Here it is.

706
00:34:40,091 --> 00:34:41,854
And then, when I started
nailing hot chicks

707
00:34:41,926 --> 00:34:43,018
by acting like an asshole,

708
00:34:43,094 --> 00:34:44,186
I started being an asshole,

709
00:34:44,262 --> 00:34:45,661
Which is totally cool.

710
00:34:45,730 --> 00:34:47,994
Yeah.

711
00:34:50,802 --> 00:34:52,167
It's Kristy again.

712
00:34:52,237 --> 00:34:53,829
She keeps calling. She's like, "Mmm. "

713
00:34:53,905 --> 00:34:55,270
I kneW I shouldn't
have invited her over

714
00:34:55,340 --> 00:34:56,705
for that threesome with Sherry.

715
00:34:57,842 --> 00:34:59,275
I'm kidding.

716
00:34:59,344 --> 00:35:00,777
That's me being a dick again.

717
00:35:00,845 --> 00:35:02,472
There was no threesome.

718
00:35:02,547 --> 00:35:04,014
I just fucked her.

719
00:35:12,123 --> 00:35:13,522
<i>Hello, sir.</i>

720
00:35:13,591 --> 00:35:15,923
<i>Are you sick of those
cooze queens out there</i>

721
00:35:15,994 --> 00:35:18,428
<i>flaunting their shit in front of you,</i>

722
00:35:18,496 --> 00:35:21,158
<i>only to leave you high and dry?</i>

723
00:35:21,232 --> 00:35:22,563
<i>- Yeah.
- You know us men.</i>

724
00:35:22,634 --> 00:35:24,158
<i>We make more money,</i>

725
00:35:24,235 --> 00:35:26,396
<i>we reach higher management positions.</i>

726
00:35:26,471 --> 00:35:28,939
<i>And what do women have?</i>

727
00:35:29,007 --> 00:35:32,408
<i>"Menstruation?" Take it, it's yours.</i>

728
00:35:32,477 --> 00:35:34,843
<i>Pregnancy? Oh, dear me.</i>

729
00:35:34,913 --> 00:35:36,642
<i>You mean I don't get to lactate?</i>

730
00:35:36,714 --> 00:35:37,908
<i>Perfect.</i>

731
00:35:37,982 --> 00:35:39,313
<i>I'm Ken Halsband,</i>

732
00:35:39,384 --> 00:35:41,215
<i>and in the next 45 minutes,</i>

733
00:35:41,286 --> 00:35:43,117
<i>I'm going to change your life.</i>

734
00:35:44,856 --> 00:35:46,847
Maybe you don't need sleep.

735
00:35:46,925 --> 00:35:48,290
If you're not sleeping,

736
00:35:48,359 --> 00:35:51,055
think about tired stuff
before you go to bed.

737
00:35:51,129 --> 00:35:52,756
Josh, quick,

738
00:35:52,831 --> 00:35:54,662
hoW much change in my pocket?

739
00:35:54,732 --> 00:35:56,825
AgneW, come on. we're chillin' here.

740
00:35:56,901 --> 00:35:58,027
I don't knoW, $2.00?

741
00:35:58,102 --> 00:36:00,036
Oh, so close. Buck-60

742
00:36:00,104 --> 00:36:02,129
You're slippin', man.

743
00:36:02,207 --> 00:36:03,469
What would the JeW elders think?

744
00:36:03,541 --> 00:36:05,338
Hey, AgneW, you think being a racist

745
00:36:05,410 --> 00:36:07,401
is going to make it easier
or tougher being a cop?

746
00:36:07,479 --> 00:36:09,709
I'm not a racist, dick.

747
00:36:09,781 --> 00:36:10,873
I hate everyone, all right?

748
00:36:10,949 --> 00:36:12,473
Old people, gay people,

749
00:36:12,550 --> 00:36:14,313
fat people, virgins.

750
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:15,443
It doesn't matter.

751
00:36:15,520 --> 00:36:17,488
Think I care that Joshua is a JeW? No.

752
00:36:17,555 --> 00:36:20,615
I mean, I'm not gonna borroW
money from him or anything.

753
00:36:25,396 --> 00:36:26,863
Why'd you take your bling off?

754
00:36:26,931 --> 00:36:29,024
Because you're right.

755
00:36:29,100 --> 00:36:30,533
I'm not black.

756
00:36:30,602 --> 00:36:32,001
I'm not gangsta.

757
00:36:32,070 --> 00:36:35,665
I'm just a chubby kid trying to fit in.

758
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:37,002
But I don't.

759
00:36:41,212 --> 00:36:42,645
We're so fucked!

760
00:36:42,714 --> 00:36:45,080
All those slits and tits next door,

761
00:36:45,149 --> 00:36:46,810
the fucking whores.

762
00:36:46,885 --> 00:36:48,045
They didn't hire you, huh?

763
00:36:48,119 --> 00:36:49,609
No fucking restaurant's going to hire me.

764
00:36:49,687 --> 00:36:51,279
I'm too intimidating.

765
00:36:51,356 --> 00:36:53,415
I called KiWi's to see if they're hiring.

766
00:36:53,491 --> 00:36:54,583
Only lunch shifts.

767
00:36:54,659 --> 00:36:56,854
I have a friend who works at Nacho's.

768
00:36:56,928 --> 00:36:59,192
I really don't want to work
at a Mexican restaurant.

769
00:36:59,264 --> 00:37:00,822
- who does?
- Mexicans.

770
00:37:00,899 --> 00:37:03,231
Hey, watch it, fuckers.

771
00:37:04,302 --> 00:37:05,599
Could've told me he's right there.

772
00:37:05,670 --> 00:37:07,570
Nacho's won't hire me, either.

773
00:37:07,639 --> 00:37:10,938
I wrote "Nachos sucks"
in dog shit on their front wall.

774
00:37:11,009 --> 00:37:12,203
HoW'd they knoW it was you?

775
00:37:12,277 --> 00:37:14,006
All right, it was my shit, okay?

776
00:37:14,078 --> 00:37:15,739
So just... just leave me alone.

777
00:37:15,813 --> 00:37:18,111
Got a figure out a way to keep
this crap hole from closing.

778
00:37:18,182 --> 00:37:19,877
Hey, if it's meant to be,
it's meant to be.

779
00:37:19,951 --> 00:37:21,213
You shit in your hand?

780
00:37:21,286 --> 00:37:23,015
I believe that the positive energies

781
00:37:23,087 --> 00:37:24,418
that you put out in the universe...

782
00:37:24,489 --> 00:37:25,683
That's kind of hot.

783
00:37:25,757 --> 00:37:28,248
<i>Go on, Eugene, talk to her.</i>

784
00:37:28,326 --> 00:37:30,123
<i>L- I can't.</i>

785
00:37:30,194 --> 00:37:32,992
<i>I masturbate to thoughts
of talking to women.</i>

786
00:37:33,064 --> 00:37:34,258
Crap, I do that.

787
00:37:34,332 --> 00:37:36,800
<i>Later on, we'll get
into good opening lines</i>

788
00:37:36,868 --> 00:37:38,597
<i>that'll break a chick's spirit.</i>

789
00:37:38,670 --> 00:37:42,037
<i>But for now, let's concentrate
on learning how to separate</i>

790
00:37:42,106 --> 00:37:43,733
<i>the pussy from the chaff.</i>

791
00:37:43,808 --> 00:37:47,642
<i>Obviously, you just want to hit on chicks
that'll put out.</i>

792
00:37:47,712 --> 00:37:49,771
<i>So you have to establish a hierarchy.</i>

793
00:37:49,847 --> 00:37:53,476
<i>Take these two over here, sipping the water.</i>

794
00:37:53,551 --> 00:37:55,143
<i>You want a bunch of sober chicks</i>

795
00:37:55,219 --> 00:37:56,811
<i>that are going to be peeing all night?</i>

796
00:37:56,888 --> 00:37:58,082
<i>Unless it's on you, forget it.</i>

797
00:37:58,156 --> 00:37:59,851
<i>Now, this one over here</i>

798
00:37:59,924 --> 00:38:01,949
<i>drinking the Long Island iced tea, bingo.</i>

799
00:38:02,026 --> 00:38:04,620
<i>Now, I'm not saying it's okay
to have sex with women</i>

800
00:38:04,696 --> 00:38:07,028
<i>when they're drunk because...</i>

801
00:38:07,098 --> 00:38:08,656
<i>All right, I'm saying it's okay</i>

802
00:38:08,733 --> 00:38:10,291
<i>to have sex with them
when they're drunk.</i>

803
00:38:10,368 --> 00:38:12,097
<i>How else are you going to get laid?</i>

804
00:38:12,170 --> 00:38:14,195
<i>Now, our friend over here
with the cigarette,</i>

805
00:38:14,272 --> 00:38:16,035
<i>if she's willing to risk lung cancer,</i>

806
00:38:16,107 --> 00:38:18,667
<i>she's willing to risk a
sexually transmitted disease.</i>

807
00:38:18,743 --> 00:38:21,234
<i>And that's a good thing.</i>

808
00:38:23,281 --> 00:38:24,839
<i>Look at this one with the tat.</i>

809
00:38:24,916 --> 00:38:27,043
<i>Tat always means
good to go, right, Eugene?</i>

810
00:38:27,118 --> 00:38:29,177
<i>- Right.
- wrong.</i>

811
00:38:29,253 --> 00:38:31,517
<i>That's a tattoo of a cross.
That means loves God.</i>

812
00:38:31,589 --> 00:38:33,181
<i>- Right.
- wrong again.</i>

813
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:35,122
<i>See the earrings, see the necklace?</i>

814
00:38:35,193 --> 00:38:36,455
<i>Multiple crosses.</i>

815
00:38:36,527 --> 00:38:37,892
<i>Let me break this down.</i>

816
00:38:37,962 --> 00:38:40,954
<i>One cross, loves the Bible.</i>

817
00:38:41,032 --> 00:38:42,158
<i>Four crosses,</i>

818
00:38:42,233 --> 00:38:44,861
<i>hates step-daddy, loves cock.</i>

819
00:38:46,004 --> 00:38:47,301
I want bad Christians.

820
00:38:47,372 --> 00:38:50,933
<i>Now, the key is to find a girl
with several of those traits.</i>

821
00:38:51,009 --> 00:38:54,308
<i>You show me a girl
who's drunk, smoking a cigarette,</i>

822
00:38:54,379 --> 00:38:55,471
<i>with a tattoo on her back</i>

823
00:38:55,546 --> 00:38:56,877
<i>does tons of drugs,</i>

824
00:38:56,948 --> 00:38:58,245
<i>and I'll show you a girl</i>

825
00:38:58,316 --> 00:39:01,774
<i>who'll take two dicks in her ass
at the same time.</i>

826
00:39:01,853 --> 00:39:03,753
<i>I couldn't sit down for a week.</i>

827
00:39:03,821 --> 00:39:05,083
<i>And that's not a bad thing.</i>

828
00:39:05,156 --> 00:39:07,920
<i>And speaking of drugs,</i>

829
00:39:07,992 --> 00:39:09,789
<i>I highly recommend you start buying them.</i>

830
00:39:09,861 --> 00:39:13,160
- Hey, Dennis?
- Oh, hey, AgneW.

831
00:39:13,231 --> 00:39:14,323
HoW you doing, man?

832
00:39:14,399 --> 00:39:15,923
Uh, I got to run home real quick.

833
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,264
My roommate locked her keys
in the car, I have her spare.

834
00:39:18,336 --> 00:39:19,394
Chicks, man.

835
00:39:19,470 --> 00:39:20,528
They'd forget their oWn vaginas

836
00:39:20,605 --> 00:39:22,038
if they weren't attached to their legs...

837
00:39:22,106 --> 00:39:24,040
to their torsos.

838
00:39:24,108 --> 00:39:26,338
Good one.

839
00:39:31,015 --> 00:39:32,949
Asshole.

840
00:39:39,657 --> 00:39:41,522
Who's smoking weed?

841
00:39:43,294 --> 00:39:44,852
Guys, what the hell?

842
00:39:44,929 --> 00:39:46,055
Hey, hey.

843
00:39:46,130 --> 00:39:48,428
That's not cool, man.

844
00:39:48,499 --> 00:39:50,057
Can I get a hit of that?

845
00:39:50,134 --> 00:39:51,863
Hell, no, Mason.

846
00:39:51,936 --> 00:39:53,096
You never share
your motherfucking weed.

847
00:39:53,171 --> 00:39:54,502
I alWays share my weed.

848
00:39:54,572 --> 00:39:56,096
Is that true?

849
00:39:58,943 --> 00:40:00,205
<i>Sí, he shares.</i>

850
00:40:00,278 --> 00:40:02,212
Yeah. I'm not selfish.

851
00:40:11,556 --> 00:40:12,989
What did Amber have to say?

852
00:40:13,057 --> 00:40:15,491
She was looking for you.

853
00:40:15,560 --> 00:40:17,050
She was?

854
00:40:17,128 --> 00:40:19,926
NoW's the time to make
your move, lover boy.

855
00:40:29,407 --> 00:40:30,931
Son of a bitch!

856
00:40:38,349 --> 00:40:40,715
Allison, what the fuck?

857
00:40:40,785 --> 00:40:42,218
It's just one cigarette.

858
00:40:42,286 --> 00:40:43,776
All the girls come out here to smoke.

859
00:40:43,855 --> 00:40:46,449
It's a good excuse to come outside
to, like, hang out.

860
00:40:46,524 --> 00:40:47,650
I was barely inhaling.

861
00:40:47,725 --> 00:40:49,386
You've been working here for one day,

862
00:40:49,460 --> 00:40:52,020
and you're already turned
into Lindsay fucking Lohan?

863
00:40:54,165 --> 00:40:55,632
You take that back.

864
00:40:57,769 --> 00:41:00,329
AgneW.

865
00:41:00,404 --> 00:41:01,871
So that's your boyfriend.

866
00:41:03,574 --> 00:41:05,838
Can I have that?

867
00:41:05,910 --> 00:41:08,140
<i>If a girl's all messed up
on drugs and alcohol</i>

868
00:41:08,212 --> 00:41:09,679
<i>and half-asleep,</i>

869
00:41:09,747 --> 00:41:11,738
<i>I don't think I'd feel right
having sex with her.</i>

870
00:41:11,816 --> 00:41:15,047
<i>That is a moral dilemma, Eugene.</i>

871
00:41:15,119 --> 00:41:16,313
<i>Wait a minute.</i>

872
00:41:16,387 --> 00:41:17,411
<i>I think I have an answer.</i>

873
00:41:17,488 --> 00:41:18,955
<i>Fuck her,</i>

874
00:41:19,023 --> 00:41:20,217
<i>and then the next morning,</i>

875
00:41:20,291 --> 00:41:21,758
<i>fuck her again when she's sober.</i>

876
00:41:21,826 --> 00:41:23,794
<i>If she lets you fuck her
again when she's sober,</i>

877
00:41:23,861 --> 00:41:25,453
<i>then you're out of the woods.</i>

878
00:41:25,530 --> 00:41:26,929
<i>If she doesn't let you fuck her again,</i>

879
00:41:26,998 --> 00:41:29,558
<i>then you got a little bit of a problem.</i>

880
00:41:29,634 --> 00:41:30,794
<i>But wait a minute.</i>

881
00:41:30,868 --> 00:41:32,199
<i>It's not that big a problem</i>

882
00:41:32,270 --> 00:41:35,137
<i>because somebody just got laid,</i>

883
00:41:35,206 --> 00:41:37,766
<i>and that's a good thing.</i>

884
00:41:37,842 --> 00:41:40,072
Fuck corporate.

885
00:41:40,144 --> 00:41:42,374
Meet Dennis Moynahan,

886
00:41:42,446 --> 00:41:44,641
district cooze manager.

887
00:41:53,491 --> 00:41:55,083
Hey, Naomi.

888
00:41:55,159 --> 00:41:57,923
You been crying
like a little bitch in your office?

889
00:41:57,995 --> 00:42:00,122
Looks like this place is
gonna fill up pretty soon.

890
00:42:00,198 --> 00:42:01,358
HoW's it going up here?

891
00:42:01,432 --> 00:42:02,626
Boring as shit. I hate you.

892
00:42:02,700 --> 00:42:04,930
Maybe you got to work on your attitude

893
00:42:05,002 --> 00:42:07,994
because I've noticed lately
you've been sort of a Negative Nancy.

894
00:42:08,072 --> 00:42:09,699
Well, I'm going to be
a real Cunty McShitterman

895
00:42:09,774 --> 00:42:11,571
if you don't let me back on the floor!

896
00:42:12,743 --> 00:42:14,506
Hey, Naomi,

897
00:42:14,579 --> 00:42:16,274
you're pretty good friends
With Kristy, right?

898
00:42:16,347 --> 00:42:17,871
No.

899
00:42:17,949 --> 00:42:19,610
She a heavy drinker?

900
00:42:19,684 --> 00:42:21,618
We're all heavy drinkers. I just...

901
00:42:21,686 --> 00:42:22,812
I knoW she smokes.

902
00:42:22,887 --> 00:42:25,822
Does she smoke, uh,
marijuana cigarettes?

903
00:42:25,890 --> 00:42:27,517
She have a tattoo?

904
00:42:27,592 --> 00:42:28,991
Are you a fucking insurance agent?

905
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:30,357
- Get the fuck out of here!
- Hi.

906
00:42:30,428 --> 00:42:32,020
Hi, cooze queens... cooze persons.

907
00:42:32,096 --> 00:42:33,290
- Three? All righty.
- Yeah.

908
00:42:33,364 --> 00:42:35,764
Ladies. Excuse me.

909
00:42:40,271 --> 00:42:42,796
Someone's parents
didn't pick them up.

910
00:42:42,874 --> 00:42:45,399
Hello, Amber Alert.

911
00:42:45,476 --> 00:42:46,636
Oh, my God.

912
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:48,008
This guy is being such a jerk.

913
00:42:48,079 --> 00:42:50,070
I just asked him if he wanted
the Early Bird Special,

914
00:42:50,147 --> 00:42:52,012
and he's like, "Do I look
like I can't afford... "

915
00:42:52,083 --> 00:42:53,744
You want me to shit in his food?

916
00:42:53,818 --> 00:42:56,480
Kristy, look at me.
I will shit in his food.

917
00:42:56,554 --> 00:42:59,148
No, I don't think...
That... That's too much.

918
00:42:59,223 --> 00:43:00,986
HoW about I tug one out in his refill?

919
00:43:01,058 --> 00:43:03,083
No, I... That's...
He doesn't deserve that.

920
00:43:03,160 --> 00:43:04,821
Crop dust.

921
00:43:04,896 --> 00:43:07,387
Hey, Chuck. HoW's your asshole?

922
00:43:07,465 --> 00:43:10,093
Hey, Suze, come here for a sec.

923
00:43:11,402 --> 00:43:13,370
Hey, Suze. HoW's it going?

924
00:43:13,437 --> 00:43:15,098
- Good.
- Good.

925
00:43:15,172 --> 00:43:17,902
I want to ask you a question.
Who do you think is sexier?

926
00:43:17,975 --> 00:43:20,136
Trina or Sherry?

927
00:43:20,211 --> 00:43:22,236
I mean, they're both pretty fucking sexy,

928
00:43:22,313 --> 00:43:24,213
but if you had to choose one,

929
00:43:24,282 --> 00:43:26,045
gun to your head, who do you pick?

930
00:43:26,117 --> 00:43:29,109
Uh, well, I wouldn't pick
either of them, personally.

931
00:43:29,186 --> 00:43:30,312
But that's just me.

932
00:43:30,388 --> 00:43:31,548
Are you out of your mind?

933
00:43:31,622 --> 00:43:32,816
Seriously, have you gone crazy?

934
00:43:32,890 --> 00:43:34,323
Look at those girls.

935
00:43:34,392 --> 00:43:36,826
They're fucking smoking hot,
those girls.

936
00:43:36,894 --> 00:43:39,089
They have virtually no body fat,

937
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:40,221
except where it counts...

938
00:43:40,298 --> 00:43:41,925
So? Neither do I.

939
00:43:42,967 --> 00:43:44,025
Oh, woW.

940
00:43:44,101 --> 00:43:46,262
Interesting, no,
I just never thought of you,

941
00:43:46,337 --> 00:43:47,895
you knoW, like that.

942
00:43:47,972 --> 00:43:49,872
You knoW, you're hot,
but, I mean, are you sexy?

943
00:43:49,941 --> 00:43:52,876
Being a slut doesn't
make you sexy, Cal.

944
00:43:52,944 --> 00:43:54,468
It helps.

945
00:43:54,545 --> 00:43:55,842
Well, maybe.

946
00:43:55,913 --> 00:43:57,437
You knoW, but I'm still, like,

947
00:43:57,515 --> 00:44:01,645
150 to 250 percent sexier
than both of those bitches.

948
00:44:01,719 --> 00:44:03,016
Can you prove it?

949
00:44:03,087 --> 00:44:04,281
Fine.

950
00:44:05,923 --> 00:44:07,413
And that's hoW it's done.

951
00:44:08,759 --> 00:44:10,818
- Yeah.
- Right?

952
00:44:10,895 --> 00:44:13,022
- She's totally hot.
- Yeah.

953
00:44:13,097 --> 00:44:14,223
You said she wasn't.

954
00:44:14,298 --> 00:44:15,424
She liked that, yeah.

955
00:44:15,499 --> 00:44:17,057
She liked that.

956
00:44:17,134 --> 00:44:19,125
Okay, guys.
We want to detonate quietly.

957
00:44:19,203 --> 00:44:21,899
We want it to creep up on him
and grip him like a noose.

958
00:44:21,973 --> 00:44:23,941
I got one breWing.

959
00:44:27,178 --> 00:44:29,169
Mason, you going to be okay with this?

960
00:44:29,246 --> 00:44:32,215
You're not going to shit
on yourself again, are you?

961
00:44:32,283 --> 00:44:34,581
I hope not.

962
00:44:34,652 --> 00:44:36,279
You knoW, like, oWning what I'm up to.

963
00:44:36,354 --> 00:44:37,514
Yeah, I knoW.

964
00:44:37,588 --> 00:44:38,919
Really in the spot.

965
00:44:38,990 --> 00:44:41,220
Just get some chicks.

966
00:44:41,292 --> 00:44:44,193
- Just, like, decent-looking.
- Yeah.

967
00:44:44,261 --> 00:44:45,285
- Decent-looking.
- They were cute.

968
00:44:49,533 --> 00:44:51,091
I'm running on empty.

969
00:44:56,674 --> 00:44:59,404
- Smell it?
- No, no. God please, no.

970
00:44:59,477 --> 00:45:01,843
Do I smell weed?

971
00:45:03,781 --> 00:45:05,510
Bro, that ain't weed.

972
00:45:08,019 --> 00:45:09,611
Tell those tools it's on me.

973
00:45:11,222 --> 00:45:14,316
Smells like... like broccoli or something.

974
00:45:17,128 --> 00:45:18,959
Here's your drink, sir.

975
00:45:19,030 --> 00:45:21,157
The bartender took extra
special care of it for you.

976
00:45:21,232 --> 00:45:23,166
Is there a problem
With your ventilation or something?

977
00:45:23,234 --> 00:45:24,326
You knoW, I don't knoW,

978
00:45:24,402 --> 00:45:26,199
but I will certainly
check on that for you.

979
00:45:26,270 --> 00:45:27,794
All right.

980
00:45:27,872 --> 00:45:29,499
Look.

981
00:45:29,573 --> 00:45:32,167
You dropped your napkin.

982
00:45:32,243 --> 00:45:35,940
I am sexually aroused right noW.

983
00:45:36,013 --> 00:45:39,141
Here. You dropped that.

984
00:45:40,718 --> 00:45:43,482
- AW, man.
- what the fuck?

985
00:45:43,554 --> 00:45:46,421
Ladies and gentlemen,
Trivia Night is going to start in 15 minutes.

986
00:45:46,490 --> 00:45:49,323
Why does every conversation
dead-end with us talking about tits?

987
00:45:49,393 --> 00:45:52,954
Because tits are what
this entire empire is based on.

988
00:45:53,030 --> 00:45:54,122
I mean, it's inevitable.

989
00:45:54,198 --> 00:45:56,860
Girls with big tits talk shit
about the girls with little tits.

990
00:45:56,934 --> 00:45:59,232
The girls with little tits
talk shit about the girls with big tits.

991
00:45:59,303 --> 00:46:00,327
The girls with real tits

992
00:46:00,404 --> 00:46:02,304
talk shit about the girls with fake tits.

993
00:46:03,407 --> 00:46:05,398
What about the girls with fake tits?

994
00:46:05,476 --> 00:46:06,807
What about them?

995
00:46:06,877 --> 00:46:09,277
They just try to get along with everyone.

996
00:46:09,346 --> 00:46:11,211
And, yeah, okay,

997
00:46:11,282 --> 00:46:12,840
so maybe they got fake tits.

998
00:46:12,917 --> 00:46:15,477
But it really helps them make extra tips,

999
00:46:15,553 --> 00:46:17,612
so it's kind of like
a business investment,

1000
00:46:17,688 --> 00:46:21,886
and maybe there's a tiny
self-esteem issue there.

1001
00:46:21,959 --> 00:46:23,586
But screW you for judging...

1002
00:46:23,661 --> 00:46:25,288
them.

1003
00:46:29,066 --> 00:46:30,158
Whoops.

1004
00:46:30,234 --> 00:46:31,861
Hey, Kristy.

1005
00:46:31,936 --> 00:46:33,733
- Let me ask you a question.
- Hey.

1006
00:46:33,804 --> 00:46:35,431
Uh, who do you think is sexier?

1007
00:46:35,506 --> 00:46:38,998
Amber or Naomi?

1008
00:46:39,076 --> 00:46:41,806
Amber, I guess.

1009
00:46:43,214 --> 00:46:44,875
She's younger and not so burnt out.

1010
00:46:44,949 --> 00:46:47,349
Uh, do you think she's
sexier than you are?

1011
00:46:49,053 --> 00:46:51,783
- I don't knoW.
- Because I do.

1012
00:46:53,791 --> 00:46:55,452
Okay.

1013
00:46:56,460 --> 00:46:59,224
That was really mean, Dennis.

1014
00:47:03,467 --> 00:47:04,957
<i>- Hello?
- Hey, Dennis.</i>

1015
00:47:05,035 --> 00:47:06,525
<i>Just checking to see how it's going.</i>

1016
00:47:06,604 --> 00:47:08,094
Oh, uh, real good.

1017
00:47:08,172 --> 00:47:09,537
I'm very, very confident
I'm going to get those num...

1018
00:47:09,607 --> 00:47:11,234
<i>Yeah, give me a chili dog
and curly friesl</i>

1019
00:47:11,308 --> 00:47:12,741
<i>So did you rally your guys?</i>

1020
00:47:12,810 --> 00:47:14,175
Yeah. You knoW,

1021
00:47:14,245 --> 00:47:16,042
I gave them one of my famous
halftime speeches...

1022
00:47:16,113 --> 00:47:19,082
<i>You didn't tell them
the restaurant's closing, did you?</i>

1023
00:47:19,150 --> 00:47:21,243
Uh, yeah, I did.

1024
00:47:21,318 --> 00:47:23,013
<i>Jesus, Dennisl</i>

1025
00:47:23,087 --> 00:47:24,952
<i>Well, for what it's worth, I told Shull</i>

1026
00:47:25,022 --> 00:47:26,887
<i>you're the right man to run the district.</i>

1027
00:47:26,957 --> 00:47:28,151
<i>I really talked you up.</i>

1028
00:47:28,225 --> 00:47:29,783
Oh, yeah? Great.

1029
00:47:29,860 --> 00:47:31,919
<i>But he didn't seem to care.</i>

1030
00:47:31,996 --> 00:47:33,554
<i>Said if you're one dollar short,</i>

1031
00:47:33,631 --> 00:47:35,861
<i>you'd better get used
to sucking Calvin's farts.</i>

1032
00:47:35,933 --> 00:47:37,457
<i>His words.</i>

1033
00:47:37,535 --> 00:47:38,627
<i>Later.</i>

1034
00:47:38,702 --> 00:47:47,435
<i>The ass is the new vagina.</i>

1035
00:48:02,626 --> 00:48:04,992
As a result, my mouth tasted
just like buttermilk.

1036
00:48:06,230 --> 00:48:08,357
Fucking great. Black people.

1037
00:48:08,432 --> 00:48:11,629
Can I get some hot sauce
and Kool-Aid and not tip?

1038
00:48:11,702 --> 00:48:13,260
AgneW, did you ever stop to think

1039
00:48:13,337 --> 00:48:15,237
maybe it's because of the
White poWer structure in this country

1040
00:48:15,306 --> 00:48:17,467
screWing over minorities,
and they make less money,

1041
00:48:17,541 --> 00:48:19,441
and, you knoW, don't learn
the etiquette of tipping?

1042
00:48:19,510 --> 00:48:21,000
You ever think of that?

1043
00:48:22,346 --> 00:48:23,608
All right, Malcolm X.

1044
00:48:23,681 --> 00:48:24,875
You want my table?

1045
00:48:24,949 --> 00:48:28,214
No, I don't want to mess up
the seating rotation.

1046
00:48:28,285 --> 00:48:30,776
Shit, what do I want to eat?

1047
00:48:32,456 --> 00:48:34,788
Didn't even knoW we had
egg rolls. That's really...

1048
00:48:47,805 --> 00:48:49,864
Why you so shy around her?

1049
00:48:49,940 --> 00:48:50,998
Dude, shut up.

1050
00:48:51,075 --> 00:48:52,804
You want me to go
say something for you?

1051
00:48:52,876 --> 00:48:55,777
No, no. Hey, I'm serious, all right?
That shit's not funny.

1052
00:48:58,315 --> 00:49:00,840
Mase, what's it gonna be, man?

1053
00:49:00,918 --> 00:49:02,112
We got to get it in quick
before the rush,

1054
00:49:02,186 --> 00:49:03,312
or you're not going to eat.

1055
00:49:03,387 --> 00:49:04,354
And you can't miss a meal.

1056
00:49:04,421 --> 00:49:08,949
Uh, well, it's betWeen the hamburger
and the chicken sandWich.

1057
00:49:09,026 --> 00:49:11,358
Uh, had a hamburger yesterday.

1058
00:49:11,428 --> 00:49:12,588
I've been in the mood for chicken, so...

1059
00:49:12,663 --> 00:49:14,528
You're gonna order
the chicken sandWich.

1060
00:49:14,598 --> 00:49:16,327
Yeah. Yeah, I think I'm
going to get the chick...

1061
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:19,062
Don't think here.
I'm not offering it up for debate.

1062
00:49:19,136 --> 00:49:21,434
I'm telling you, you're gonna order
the goddamn chicken sandWich.

1063
00:49:21,505 --> 00:49:23,029
Yeah, but I was about to order the...

1064
00:49:23,107 --> 00:49:24,199
Don't you "but" me, boy.

1065
00:49:24,275 --> 00:49:25,435
You're gonna order
the chicken sandWich

1066
00:49:25,509 --> 00:49:27,500
because I am telling you, I will it.

1067
00:49:27,578 --> 00:49:29,102
The end.

1068
00:49:29,179 --> 00:49:31,374
You knoW what, Chuck?

1069
00:49:31,448 --> 00:49:32,710
Fuck you!

1070
00:49:32,783 --> 00:49:34,216
I'm gonna get the hamburger.

1071
00:49:41,225 --> 00:49:42,487
I want the chicken sandWich.

1072
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:44,117
You're goddamn right, you do.

1073
00:49:44,194 --> 00:49:45,525
You're gonna order
that chicken sandWich right noW, Mason.

1074
00:49:45,596 --> 00:49:49,032
NoW. with fries.

1075
00:49:49,099 --> 00:49:50,361
- Curly?
- Yes.

1076
00:49:50,434 --> 00:49:52,197
Shenaniganz.

1077
00:49:52,269 --> 00:49:54,430
Oh, I'm sorry to hear that.

1078
00:49:54,505 --> 00:49:55,631
<i>8 rib-eyes,</i>

1079
00:49:55,706 --> 00:49:56,798
<i>- 2 New York strips,
- what?</i>

1080
00:49:56,874 --> 00:49:58,398
<i>4 Greek salads...</i>

1081
00:49:58,475 --> 00:50:00,568
Okay, let's go! Look at this!

1082
00:50:00,644 --> 00:50:02,009
Let's move, let's move.

1083
00:50:02,079 --> 00:50:03,706
Come on. whoo, whoo, whoo.

1084
00:50:03,781 --> 00:50:05,009
Step up, will you?

1085
00:50:09,219 --> 00:50:11,551
Mary-Kate and Ashley,
What's going on around here?

1086
00:50:11,622 --> 00:50:13,385
Naomi just put in
a massive to-go order,

1087
00:50:13,457 --> 00:50:16,119
like, a couple thousand dollars' worth.

1088
00:50:22,199 --> 00:50:25,134
Thank you so much for your business.

1089
00:50:25,202 --> 00:50:26,965
You really saved my ass.

1090
00:50:27,037 --> 00:50:29,767
My caterer got killed
on the way to the office.

1091
00:50:32,109 --> 00:50:33,974
Yes.

1092
00:50:34,044 --> 00:50:35,375
Okay, men.

1093
00:50:35,446 --> 00:50:37,607
Thanks to a Hail Mary pass
in the seventh inning,

1094
00:50:37,681 --> 00:50:39,410
We are back in the race.

1095
00:50:39,483 --> 00:50:41,508
Ha ha! 2 points.

1096
00:50:41,585 --> 00:50:45,521
Okay, we can still make that sales goal
and save this restaurant.

1097
00:50:45,589 --> 00:50:46,647
You knoW what that means.

1098
00:50:46,724 --> 00:50:50,683
This can either be your biggest failure
or your greatest triumph.

1099
00:50:51,695 --> 00:50:53,253
And I don't want to frighten anybody,

1100
00:50:53,330 --> 00:50:55,821
but if we don't have
an absolutely perfect dinner shift,

1101
00:50:55,899 --> 00:50:58,595
then you're all out on your asses,
maybe even deported.

1102
00:50:58,669 --> 00:51:00,864
So let's pull it together

1103
00:51:00,938 --> 00:51:02,565
and win, win, win one
for the home team.

1104
00:51:02,639 --> 00:51:03,901
And remember,

1105
00:51:03,974 --> 00:51:06,704
What is going to happen
to each and every one of you

1106
00:51:06,777 --> 00:51:08,768
if this place closes doWn?

1107
00:51:08,846 --> 00:51:10,837
We'll be able to go on unemployment.

1108
00:51:15,052 --> 00:51:16,576
Here you go.

1109
00:51:18,255 --> 00:51:19,916
Okay, all right, okay.

1110
00:51:24,695 --> 00:51:27,061
One margarita, our special...

1111
00:51:28,632 --> 00:51:30,327
Remember the butterfly effect.

1112
00:51:30,401 --> 00:51:32,767
Go, go, go!

1113
00:51:32,836 --> 00:51:34,701
Okay, you've got a wang Chung,

1114
00:51:34,772 --> 00:51:37,400
a dime bag, and a beef vagina walking back.

1115
00:51:37,474 --> 00:51:40,966
I got a booger chicken,
a burnt tube steak,

1116
00:51:41,044 --> 00:51:42,170
and a whitney Houston.

1117
00:51:42,246 --> 00:51:45,272
I need a Lincoln broWn eyes,
tWo kids' dicks,

1118
00:51:45,349 --> 00:51:46,748
and a stripper on the rag.

1119
00:52:01,265 --> 00:52:02,664
Got to be careful.

1120
00:52:02,733 --> 00:52:04,223
Hi.

1121
00:52:12,543 --> 00:52:14,374
Oh, dear.

1122
00:52:14,445 --> 00:52:17,141
You guys picked my table.

1123
00:52:26,590 --> 00:52:28,023
Folks, my name is Joshua.

1124
00:52:28,091 --> 00:52:29,353
Can I get you anything?

1125
00:52:29,426 --> 00:52:30,688
Do you have a salad bar?

1126
00:52:30,761 --> 00:52:31,989
What's your fish of the day?

1127
00:52:32,062 --> 00:52:33,757
No, we don't have a salad bar,

1128
00:52:33,831 --> 00:52:36,299
and we don't have
a fish of the day, either, all right?

1129
00:52:36,366 --> 00:52:38,834
I- I am so sorry.

1130
00:52:38,902 --> 00:52:40,767
Um, can we start over?

1131
00:52:40,838 --> 00:52:43,602
My name is Joshua, and I need help.

1132
00:52:43,674 --> 00:52:44,834
Can I get you any?

1133
00:52:44,908 --> 00:52:46,466
Hey, guys.

1134
00:52:46,543 --> 00:52:49,034
I'm really sorry,
but I messed up table 37.

1135
00:52:49,112 --> 00:52:50,704
They want honey-glaze on the side.

1136
00:52:50,781 --> 00:52:52,646
- Don't you worry.
- It's okay.

1137
00:52:52,716 --> 00:52:53,944
Kristy, I love you.

1138
00:52:54,017 --> 00:52:55,279
Do you think you could
change it for me?

1139
00:52:55,352 --> 00:52:57,877
<i>- Don't you worry.
- It's okay, mami.</i>

1140
00:52:57,955 --> 00:52:59,946
Okay, I'll... I'll be right back for it.

1141
00:53:00,023 --> 00:53:02,719
- Okay, thank you, guys.
- Bye-bye.

1142
00:53:06,630 --> 00:53:09,326
Hey, guys,
table 68 changed their order.

1143
00:53:09,399 --> 00:53:11,333
They need that steak well-done.

1144
00:53:14,404 --> 00:53:15,803
Just this party of tWo here.

1145
00:53:15,873 --> 00:53:17,033
Right this way, ma'am.

1146
00:53:17,107 --> 00:53:18,404
I'm sorry. You're a sir.

1147
00:53:18,475 --> 00:53:20,739
Will you tell Naomi
to get her ass up here?

1148
00:53:20,811 --> 00:53:22,210
Uh, folloW me, please.

1149
00:53:22,279 --> 00:53:23,837
Well, hello there, folks.

1150
00:53:23,914 --> 00:53:25,040
It's great to see you this evening.

1151
00:53:25,115 --> 00:53:26,776
Hey, you too. HoW long for tWo of us?

1152
00:53:26,850 --> 00:53:28,943
Uh, just a feW moments.

1153
00:53:29,019 --> 00:53:30,748
We had a little hepatitis
scare in the kitchen,

1154
00:53:30,821 --> 00:53:32,618
but we'll have it cleaned up in a jiffy.

1155
00:53:32,689 --> 00:53:34,316
I can get your name, though.

1156
00:53:35,759 --> 00:53:37,351
TWo?

1157
00:53:37,427 --> 00:53:38,917
We're going to hit a movie, actually.

1158
00:53:38,996 --> 00:53:41,328
We don't want to miss any
of the, uh, advertisements.

1159
00:53:41,398 --> 00:53:43,457
L- Is there something wrong?

1160
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,434
Where you going?

1161
00:53:45,502 --> 00:53:46,696
Come back, come back, come back.

1162
00:53:46,770 --> 00:53:48,499
It's only Hep A.

1163
00:53:53,343 --> 00:53:55,607
Do you work out?

1164
00:53:55,679 --> 00:53:57,840
Why doesn't she just
Wear knee pads and get it over with?

1165
00:53:57,915 --> 00:53:59,473
Totally.

1166
00:53:59,550 --> 00:54:01,177
I think I can read
her lips in those shorts.

1167
00:54:01,251 --> 00:54:03,583
If she comes on to one more
of my regulars...

1168
00:54:03,654 --> 00:54:05,417
- Hi.
- Hi.

1169
00:54:05,489 --> 00:54:07,514
- Hey, hoW's your first day going?
- Good.

1170
00:54:07,591 --> 00:54:09,354
Good. well, if you need any help at all,

1171
00:54:09,426 --> 00:54:11,326
- you just let me knoW.
- Thank you.

1172
00:54:11,395 --> 00:54:15,161
You knoW, maybe sometime
you could help me out with my outfit.

1173
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:18,497
I mean, your top is so symmetrical.

1174
00:54:18,569 --> 00:54:20,560
Thanks.

1175
00:54:22,139 --> 00:54:23,697
Hey, Raddimus.

1176
00:54:23,774 --> 00:54:24,934
Yo.

1177
00:54:25,008 --> 00:54:27,203
So, I was, uh, thinking
about your little game

1178
00:54:27,277 --> 00:54:30,075
and that position
you were telling me about,

1179
00:54:30,147 --> 00:54:31,512
and I was thinking that

1180
00:54:31,582 --> 00:54:33,982
if you bent your knees a little more,

1181
00:54:34,051 --> 00:54:37,612
Wouldn't there be
a better vieW from the backside?

1182
00:54:38,689 --> 00:54:41,214
I don't knoW, it's just a thought.

1183
00:54:41,291 --> 00:54:43,555
What a nice girl.

1184
00:55:10,554 --> 00:55:14,115
Oh, I'm sorry, sir. we don't
alloW pets in the restaurant.

1185
00:55:14,191 --> 00:55:15,852
Oh, no, he's a guide dog. It's okay.

1186
00:55:15,926 --> 00:55:17,587
Are you deaf? we don't alloW dogs.

1187
00:55:17,661 --> 00:55:19,060
I don't think you understand.

1188
00:55:19,129 --> 00:55:20,653
I can't see. He's my guide dog.

1189
00:55:20,731 --> 00:55:22,062
He's alloWed in.

1190
00:55:23,767 --> 00:55:26,292
Why would you go to a tit joint

1191
00:55:26,370 --> 00:55:27,632
if you're blind?

1192
00:55:27,704 --> 00:55:30,070
AnsWer that one, Stevie wonder!

1193
00:55:30,140 --> 00:55:31,903
You knoW something?
If you had a cane,

1194
00:55:31,975 --> 00:55:33,636
I'd beat you over
the fucking head with it!

1195
00:55:33,710 --> 00:55:35,200
- Hey. Naomi.
- I would! what?

1196
00:55:35,278 --> 00:55:37,337
- what the hell are you doing?
- I'm helping.

1197
00:55:37,414 --> 00:55:39,609
Why don't you go help over at
Shenaniganz, where you work?

1198
00:55:39,683 --> 00:55:41,378
You're kidding me.
She doesn't even work here?

1199
00:55:41,451 --> 00:55:43,214
- Stay out of this.
- Sorry about this.

1200
00:55:43,286 --> 00:55:44,583
I'll have someone
take care of you immediately.

1201
00:55:44,655 --> 00:55:46,282
You. SWeet tits.

1202
00:55:46,356 --> 00:55:48,256
NoW get the hell out of here.

1203
00:55:53,363 --> 00:55:54,625
Fuck!

1204
00:55:54,698 --> 00:55:57,189
Goddamn cocksucker.
No wonder they're blind.

1205
00:55:59,369 --> 00:56:01,667
What are you looking at?

1206
00:56:01,738 --> 00:56:03,603
Fucking blind people.

1207
00:56:03,674 --> 00:56:05,198
Hey, hey.

1208
00:56:08,412 --> 00:56:10,505
You are incredible.

1209
00:56:25,562 --> 00:56:28,463
Fucking foreigners.

1210
00:56:33,003 --> 00:56:34,664
Okay.

1211
00:56:34,738 --> 00:56:37,366
Six Courvoisiers coming right up.

1212
00:56:37,441 --> 00:56:40,239
Okay, I'll get that right up for you.

1213
00:56:40,310 --> 00:56:41,777
- Excuse me.
- Yeah, yeah.

1214
00:56:43,180 --> 00:56:45,478
What the fuck is this?

1215
00:56:45,549 --> 00:56:47,779
I'm just going by rotation. Fuck off.

1216
00:56:47,851 --> 00:56:50,718
Well, start rotating
the Canadians someWhere else.

1217
00:56:50,787 --> 00:56:53,085
I want to get off the Soul Train.

1218
00:56:53,156 --> 00:56:54,953
Do you have room for a party of four?

1219
00:56:55,025 --> 00:56:56,356
- No.
- Yes, we do.

1220
00:56:56,426 --> 00:56:57,723
- Yes. we do.
- No.

1221
00:56:57,794 --> 00:56:58,886
Great.

1222
00:56:58,962 --> 00:57:01,192
No, no.

1223
00:57:05,335 --> 00:57:06,632
Hey, hey, hey!

I'll be taking care of your service.

1230
00:57:45,909 --> 00:57:48,878
Can I get you something to drink?

1231
00:57:48,945 --> 00:57:50,776
Uh, yeah, playa. Y'all got any Kool-Aid?

1232
00:57:54,718 --> 00:57:57,653
No, we do not have any Kool-Aid.

1233
00:57:57,721 --> 00:58:00,849
Well, then, I guess
I'll have a glass of Bordeaux.

1234
00:58:09,132 --> 00:58:11,896
Naomi, hoW many people
on the waiting list?

1235
00:58:13,904 --> 00:58:15,735
Oh, my God.

1236
00:58:15,806 --> 00:58:18,206
We might just pull this shit
out of our asses after all.

1237
00:58:26,850 --> 00:58:27,874
Yeah.

1238
00:58:32,055 --> 00:58:34,717
You sure knoW hoW to pour.

1239
00:58:51,875 --> 00:58:54,173
To our future.

1240
00:58:54,244 --> 00:58:56,974
You knoW what I like
most about you, Dennis?

1241
00:58:57,047 --> 00:58:58,674
What's that?

1242
00:58:58,748 --> 00:58:59,874
Your money.

1243
00:59:04,554 --> 00:59:05,885
Oh, yeah.

1244
00:59:23,773 --> 00:59:26,105
Thanks.

1245
00:59:37,087 --> 00:59:38,179
All right.

1246
00:59:38,255 --> 00:59:41,520
We've got the house salad for you, sir.

1247
00:59:41,591 --> 00:59:43,218
And the broccoli cheese soup.

1248
00:59:43,293 --> 00:59:44,453
Thank you.

1249
00:59:44,527 --> 00:59:45,721
Enjoy.

1250
00:59:45,795 --> 00:59:47,422
Wait.

1251
00:59:47,497 --> 00:59:50,625
There's a fly in my soup.

1252
00:59:50,700 --> 00:59:52,793
That's disgusting.

1253
00:59:52,869 --> 00:59:54,803
Can you cancel
my broccoli cheese soup?

1254
00:59:54,871 --> 00:59:56,099
What other soups do you have?

1255
00:59:56,172 --> 00:59:58,299
Um, French onion.

1256
00:59:58,375 --> 01:00:00,343
Yeah, let's go with that.

1257
01:00:00,410 --> 01:00:02,605
Wait, ma'am. I'm... I can replace...

1258
01:00:02,679 --> 01:00:05,671
Excuse me, can I sWitch mine
to French onion too, please?

1259
01:00:05,749 --> 01:00:07,774
- French onion, please.
- French onion.

1260
01:00:07,851 --> 01:00:09,148
Come on. Hurry.

1261
01:00:09,219 --> 01:00:11,244
Get out of my way!

1262
01:00:11,321 --> 01:00:12,447
French onion here.

1263
01:00:13,857 --> 01:00:15,791
Okay, focus, focus!

1264
01:00:17,727 --> 01:00:19,957
French onion, French onion.

1265
01:00:20,030 --> 01:00:21,327
Fuck me!

1266
01:00:26,703 --> 01:00:28,068
Son of a bitch!

1267
01:00:30,140 --> 01:00:31,801
I need fries and onion rings.

1268
01:00:31,875 --> 01:00:34,036
Uh, it's going to be a feW minutes.

1269
01:00:34,110 --> 01:00:35,236
You are fucking me, Mason!

1270
01:00:35,312 --> 01:00:36,711
It's gonna be a minute!

1271
01:00:39,582 --> 01:00:42,107
- watch it.
- Out of the way, Miguel.

1272
01:00:42,185 --> 01:00:44,176
- Mason, you look stressed.
- Shut up.

1273
01:00:49,326 --> 01:00:51,021
- Hey, Mason.
- Shut up. I'm busy.

1274
01:00:51,094 --> 01:00:53,756
At the buzzer, 3, 2, 1.

1275
01:00:55,165 --> 01:00:57,258
God damn it,
leave me the hell alone!

1276
01:00:57,334 --> 01:00:58,665
- Oh, relax, man...
- I'm not gonna relax, okay?

1277
01:00:58,735 --> 01:01:00,293
You've been picking on me
all night. NoW quit it.

1278
01:01:00,370 --> 01:01:02,429
Yeah, suffering succotash, that sucks.

1279
01:01:02,505 --> 01:01:03,665
Hey, hey, hey, hey.

1280
01:01:03,740 --> 01:01:05,537
I thought we were
in this together, you knoW?

1281
01:01:05,608 --> 01:01:06,666
Cooks against the waiters?

1282
01:01:06,743 --> 01:01:08,643
You keep attacking me!

1283
01:01:08,712 --> 01:01:10,339
It's never been "us" against "them. "

1284
01:01:12,082 --> 01:01:14,482
It's alWays been me against everyone.

1285
01:01:16,186 --> 01:01:18,450
No one's ever done me any favors.

1286
01:01:18,521 --> 01:01:22,150
My dad was... is...

1287
01:01:22,225 --> 01:01:23,624
is a drunk.

1288
01:01:28,665 --> 01:01:31,828
Look, I-I knoW what it's like.

1289
01:01:33,303 --> 01:01:35,430
My dad's an asshole, too.

1290
01:01:35,505 --> 01:01:36,665
I've got four brothers,

1291
01:01:36,740 --> 01:01:39,265
and he named them all Mason

1292
01:01:39,342 --> 01:01:41,139
so he could screW over the IRS.

1293
01:01:41,211 --> 01:01:42,473
And it didn't even work.

1294
01:01:42,545 --> 01:01:44,513
NoW we're all still named Mason.

1295
01:01:44,581 --> 01:01:47,106
It's... It's fucked up.

1296
01:01:47,183 --> 01:01:50,675
You think that's bad?
Let me shoW you something.

1297
01:01:50,754 --> 01:01:54,656
This is what happens in my house
When you spill paint in the garage.

1298
01:01:58,895 --> 01:02:00,522
Sour cream Sanchez!

1299
01:02:01,664 --> 01:02:05,293
Son of a bitch, I'm out of here!

1300
01:02:05,368 --> 01:02:07,336
- Mason.
- I hope this place does close doWn.

1301
01:02:07,404 --> 01:02:09,201
ScreW you all!

1302
01:02:09,272 --> 01:02:10,296
I quit!

1303
01:02:10,373 --> 01:02:12,170
Oopsie.

1304
01:02:12,242 --> 01:02:13,675
I forgot to punch out.

1305
01:02:15,578 --> 01:02:18,012
I want our money back!

1306
01:02:18,081 --> 01:02:20,242
- Fuck this place.
- Yeah.

1307
01:02:20,316 --> 01:02:21,476
I'm not putting up with that shit!

1308
01:02:21,551 --> 01:02:25,009
Naomi, why haven't you
set Table 43 and 44 yet?

1309
01:02:25,088 --> 01:02:26,749
I have the ten-top that's
going to your station, okay?

1310
01:02:26,823 --> 01:02:28,654
So go run some food,
and I'll get your table set up.

1311
01:02:28,725 --> 01:02:30,056
SWeet. Thanks.

1312
01:02:30,126 --> 01:02:31,684
Son of a bitch.

1313
01:02:31,761 --> 01:02:33,854
Uh, I don't knoW where the manager is.

1314
01:02:35,432 --> 01:02:37,992
Nice carry.

1315
01:02:41,271 --> 01:02:43,637
Goddamn! Get that shit up
and move it outside.

1316
01:02:43,706 --> 01:02:45,901
What's wrong, JeW?
Dropped a quarter or something?

1317
01:02:45,975 --> 01:02:48,170
I fucking hate him.

1318
01:02:48,244 --> 01:02:49,871
- Hello?
- Hello?

1319
01:02:49,946 --> 01:02:51,538
Um, hello?

1320
01:02:51,614 --> 01:02:52,672
This is ridiculous.

1321
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:55,183
We've been waiting 45 minutes,
and we still don't have our food.

1322
01:02:57,420 --> 01:03:00,253
Okay, I had the manager
comp your appetizer.

1323
01:03:00,323 --> 01:03:03,292
I had to wait an hour for veal parmesan
that tastes like her ass.

1324
01:03:03,359 --> 01:03:04,917
Looks like you tWo are getting along.

1325
01:03:04,994 --> 01:03:06,188
Fuck you.

1326
01:03:06,262 --> 01:03:07,627
Hey, big guy. Here's your napkin.

1327
01:03:07,697 --> 01:03:10,257
Looks like you chicks knoW hoW to party,

1328
01:03:10,333 --> 01:03:11,459
and I like that.

1329
01:03:11,534 --> 01:03:13,024
Hank, let's go. TWo free ones.

1330
01:03:13,103 --> 01:03:15,401
- TWo of what?
- Drink thingies.

1331
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:16,939
That's it. we're never eating here again.

1332
01:03:17,006 --> 01:03:18,405
This place is a death trap.

1333
01:03:18,475 --> 01:03:20,534
- This wine is a fucking asshole.
- I agree.

1334
01:03:20,610 --> 01:03:22,441
Excuse me, can I have
some more coffee?

1335
01:03:22,512 --> 01:03:23,672
Okay.

1336
01:03:23,746 --> 01:03:26,306
Land mine for your love

1337
01:03:26,382 --> 01:03:27,713
Soldier gal

1338
01:03:28,952 --> 01:03:31,079
I would totally buy your CD.

1339
01:03:31,154 --> 01:03:33,782
Naomi. Naomi.

1340
01:03:33,857 --> 01:03:35,757
Naomi, what happened to my ten-top?

1341
01:03:35,825 --> 01:03:37,417
And why did you seat me
four tables at once?

1342
01:03:37,494 --> 01:03:41,225
'Cause Chuck said he'd get me free drinks
if I quadruple sat you.

1343
01:03:41,297 --> 01:03:42,924
Why would he do that?

1344
01:03:42,999 --> 01:03:46,662
Because welcome
to your nightmare, bitch.

1345
01:03:49,539 --> 01:03:50,972
Motherfucker.

1346
01:03:51,040 --> 01:03:53,474
That waiter was...

1347
01:03:53,543 --> 01:03:54,874
A total douche bag.

1348
01:03:56,880 --> 01:03:57,938
There you go.

1349
01:03:58,014 --> 01:03:59,311
Hope you enjoyed everything.

1350
01:03:59,382 --> 01:04:01,441
I need you to do something
for me, AgneW, okay?

1351
01:04:01,518 --> 01:04:03,076
What's that, sir?

1352
01:04:03,153 --> 01:04:06,816
I need you to start trying
to be a better person.

1353
01:04:06,890 --> 01:04:08,949
What are you talking about?

1354
01:04:09,025 --> 01:04:10,458
I'm a great person.

1355
01:04:10,527 --> 01:04:11,926
I mean, I-I...

1356
01:04:11,995 --> 01:04:13,394
I joke around a lot, but...

1357
01:04:13,463 --> 01:04:18,230
Yeah. But after years
of alWays jokin',

1358
01:04:18,301 --> 01:04:21,668
you may find you're no longer jokin'.

1359
01:04:33,950 --> 01:04:36,145
Oh, what the fuck?

1360
01:04:46,229 --> 01:04:47,560
Josh, you still pissed about that?

1361
01:04:47,630 --> 01:04:49,564
Yes! I'm still pissed about it.

1362
01:04:51,334 --> 01:04:52,767
Come on.

1363
01:04:52,835 --> 01:04:54,632
You shouldn't be.

1364
01:04:56,105 --> 01:04:58,471
You have the cutest little balls
I've ever seen.

1365
01:05:02,478 --> 01:05:05,174
Fuck this! I quit.

1366
01:05:06,749 --> 01:05:09,217
I don't think he took that the right way.

1367
01:05:12,822 --> 01:05:15,120
Well, well, well.

1368
01:05:15,191 --> 01:05:17,989
Nick and T-daWg together again.

1369
01:05:18,061 --> 01:05:21,519
Hey, you tWo used to be
some pretty good rappers, as I recall.

1370
01:05:21,598 --> 01:05:22,690
We were fucking jokes.

1371
01:05:22,765 --> 01:05:26,997
White kids that want to be black
is a little dated and cliché.

1372
01:05:28,438 --> 01:05:30,838
Let me tell you what isn't.

1373
01:05:30,907 --> 01:05:33,899
White kids that want to be white.

1374
01:05:38,581 --> 01:05:39,946
Hey, fuck you, whitey!

1375
01:05:51,027 --> 01:05:54,519
Okay, you are all set.

1376
01:05:54,597 --> 01:05:56,462
Thank you so much. Have a great one.

1377
01:05:56,532 --> 01:05:58,159
I used to work here.

1378
01:05:58,234 --> 01:05:59,929
Really?

1379
01:06:00,003 --> 01:06:01,300
WoW, crazy.

1380
01:06:01,371 --> 01:06:03,236
So what do you do noW?

1381
01:06:03,306 --> 01:06:05,035
Oh, I'm a danc... you knoW,

1382
01:06:05,108 --> 01:06:06,735
an exotic... like... a stripper.

1383
01:06:06,809 --> 01:06:08,572
Right. You... Right.

1384
01:06:10,146 --> 01:06:12,740
Um, so hoW's the money?

1385
01:06:12,815 --> 01:06:14,248
Oh, I mean, look. I started off,

1386
01:06:14,317 --> 01:06:16,649
like, as a normal waitress, you knoW?

1387
01:06:16,719 --> 01:06:18,482
And I never even thought
I'd work at Ta-Ta's

1388
01:06:18,554 --> 01:06:21,114
'cause the outfits are so loW-cut and...

1389
01:06:21,190 --> 01:06:23,055
But I sWore to myself

1390
01:06:23,126 --> 01:06:24,991
that I would never take off
my clothes for money.

1391
01:06:25,061 --> 01:06:27,222
You knoW, never,

1392
01:06:27,297 --> 01:06:29,128
until I met a girl who worked at Cheetah's,

1393
01:06:29,198 --> 01:06:31,257
and she made, like,
500 bucks a night...

1394
01:06:31,334 --> 01:06:32,699
- whoa.
... so I did that,

1395
01:06:32,769 --> 01:06:34,327
you knoW, for the money, totally.

1396
01:06:34,404 --> 01:06:37,771
But I told myself I would
only do a topless bar,

1397
01:06:37,840 --> 01:06:40,172
like, no bottomless. No way.

1398
01:06:40,243 --> 01:06:41,870
No, no, no.

1399
01:06:41,944 --> 01:06:43,775
And then I found out
hoW much they make.

1400
01:06:43,846 --> 01:06:46,781
Like, at the all-nude clubs, and so...

1401
01:06:48,785 --> 01:06:51,049
Doing that for a feW months.

1402
01:06:51,120 --> 01:06:53,520
But, like, no contact.

1403
01:06:53,589 --> 01:06:58,720
I mean, I work with girls
Who do that, and...

1404
01:06:58,795 --> 01:07:01,355
I don't knoW, part of me wonders

1405
01:07:01,431 --> 01:07:05,026
When I'm going to let go
of that boundary too, right?

1406
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:09,162
I mean, right?

1407
01:07:12,141 --> 01:07:13,130
For the money, just for the money.

1408
01:07:13,209 --> 01:07:16,440
Right, uh, anyWay, thanks.

1409
01:07:23,453 --> 01:07:24,613
I need to talk to you.

1410
01:07:24,687 --> 01:07:25,745
No.

1411
01:07:25,822 --> 01:07:27,881
You were so aWesome today, baby.

1412
01:07:27,957 --> 01:07:28,981
Hailey, what's up?

1413
01:07:29,058 --> 01:07:30,082
What is up?

1414
01:07:30,159 --> 01:07:31,786
- I quit.
- why?

1415
01:07:31,861 --> 01:07:33,385
I just found out I can make, like,

1416
01:07:33,463 --> 01:07:35,590
$500 a night working at Cheetah's.

1417
01:07:35,665 --> 01:07:37,292
Cheetah's, whoo!

1418
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:39,767
God, we lost a good one.

1419
01:07:39,836 --> 01:07:42,771
So, we still on for tonight?

1420
01:07:42,839 --> 01:07:46,138
Um, let's do it another time, okay?

1421
01:07:46,209 --> 01:07:51,112
Listen, the important thing here is not
to blame yourself or Trina.

1422
01:07:51,180 --> 01:07:53,080
Trina?

1423
01:07:53,149 --> 01:07:55,481
Yeah, um, she won the battle.

1424
01:07:55,551 --> 01:07:56,984
But hey, listen, I have confidence,

1425
01:07:57,053 --> 01:07:59,385
if you really bring the sexy,
you can win the fucking war.

1426
01:07:59,455 --> 01:08:01,616
- ScreW her, all right?
- Done.

1427
01:08:01,691 --> 01:08:04,854
I promise you that any sick shit
that that trashy bitch can do

1428
01:08:04,927 --> 01:08:06,360
I can do, like, ten times better.

1429
01:08:06,429 --> 01:08:07,589
- Keep that energy.
- Bitch!

1430
01:08:07,663 --> 01:08:09,631
- Just bring it.
- You bitch!

1431
01:08:09,699 --> 01:08:10,961
Keep that passion.
That's what I'm talking about.

1432
01:08:11,033 --> 01:08:13,467
- Hey, baby.
- Hi, Cal.

1433
01:08:13,536 --> 01:08:15,299
Love you. Okay, listen.

1434
01:08:15,371 --> 01:08:16,702
I just need to close up here,

1435
01:08:16,773 --> 01:08:18,570
and, uh, I'm going
to hook up with my boy.

1436
01:08:18,641 --> 01:08:20,506
I'm going to pick up some party favors.

1437
01:08:20,576 --> 01:08:22,009
And we're going to party
all night long.

1438
01:08:22,078 --> 01:08:23,306
Oh, my God, aWesome.

1439
01:08:23,379 --> 01:08:26,041
Hey, I'm even getting
some muscle relaxers,

1440
01:08:26,115 --> 01:08:28,675
- in case you want to bring your "A" game.
- Yeah.

1441
01:08:28,751 --> 01:08:30,446
All right, I'll see you later, all right?

1442
01:08:33,756 --> 01:08:35,587
All right.

1443
01:08:35,658 --> 01:08:36,750
Let's do this.

1444
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:45,862
Don't get me wrong.
I mean, the band rocks.

1445
01:08:45,935 --> 01:08:48,529
I go onstage, people stop eating.

1446
01:08:48,604 --> 01:08:50,094
It's just that I feel

1447
01:08:50,173 --> 01:08:51,834
if I don't make my move
in the next feW years,

1448
01:08:51,908 --> 01:08:54,069
I'm going to become that creepy old guy,

1449
01:08:54,143 --> 01:08:56,134
you knoW, that guy.

1450
01:08:56,212 --> 01:08:57,702
Well, good neWs is

1451
01:08:57,780 --> 01:08:59,611
being an old-ass bartender
is pretty depressing, too.

1452
01:09:01,117 --> 01:09:03,278
Especially in a place like this.

1453
01:09:03,352 --> 01:09:06,913
I mean, holy shit, this is a bigger dump
than the one I worked in.

1454
01:09:06,989 --> 01:09:08,616
You knoW, it's funny.

1455
01:09:08,691 --> 01:09:12,218
I was at a bit of a moral crossroads
myself a feW years ago.

1456
01:09:12,295 --> 01:09:13,660
I didn't want to be a server,

1457
01:09:13,729 --> 01:09:16,425
and I didn't want to get stuck
in upper management, so I quit.

1458
01:09:16,499 --> 01:09:18,490
See, that's what I'm talking about.

1459
01:09:18,568 --> 01:09:19,830
You folloWed your dream.

1460
01:09:19,902 --> 01:09:21,233
Yeah.

1461
01:09:22,738 --> 01:09:24,262
Yes, I did.

1462
01:09:24,340 --> 01:09:26,069
I was unemployed for a long time.

1463
01:09:26,142 --> 01:09:28,372
And, um, I got so desperate,

1464
01:09:28,444 --> 01:09:31,936
I took a job at Jack's Steak House
as an assistant manager,

1465
01:09:32,014 --> 01:09:34,812
Which was then bought out
by the company that oWns Shenaniganz.

1466
01:09:34,884 --> 01:09:37,682
I fucked it all up, uh...

1467
01:09:37,753 --> 01:09:40,119
You knoW Internet porn?

1468
01:09:40,189 --> 01:09:42,589
I think I must have drifted
because I lost, uh...

1469
01:09:42,658 --> 01:09:46,094
I tried to... I jumped out of a windoW.

1470
01:09:46,162 --> 01:09:51,498
But it was a second-story windoW,
and I broke my ankle,

1471
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:55,503
and I got sort of like a little head injury,

1472
01:09:55,571 --> 01:09:58,005
then I became addicted to...

1473
01:09:58,074 --> 01:09:59,632
Have you ever heard of, uh, OxyContin?

1474
01:10:10,620 --> 01:10:12,281
Oh, yeah.

1475
01:10:12,355 --> 01:10:13,982
Got to piss.

1476
01:10:43,452 --> 01:10:45,477
Yeah.

1477
01:10:50,726 --> 01:10:55,060
So if you're on MySpace,
get the fuck off of it.

1478
01:10:55,131 --> 01:10:56,621
Be honest with yourself.

1479
01:10:56,699 --> 01:10:57,859
I don't knoW, I don't knoW.

1480
01:10:57,934 --> 01:10:59,765
Because of the drinking,
I tend... I get very verbose.

1481
01:10:59,835 --> 01:11:01,268
And some of the other pills I'm on,

1482
01:11:01,337 --> 01:11:02,531
it makes me kind of ramble.

1483
01:11:02,605 --> 01:11:04,038
Here's my point.
You got a great moustache.

1484
01:11:04,106 --> 01:11:05,698
Oh, this is what
I was going to tell you.

1485
01:11:05,775 --> 01:11:07,936
Whichever path you choose,

1486
01:11:08,010 --> 01:11:10,103
it's just going to go like this,

1487
01:11:10,179 --> 01:11:11,544
and then it's eventually going to go...

1488
01:11:11,614 --> 01:11:13,639
straight back to the middle.

1489
01:11:13,716 --> 01:11:16,184
That's where you're going to
spend the rest of your life...

1490
01:11:17,587 --> 01:11:19,384
But it won't be so fast,
like you knoW it.

1491
01:11:19,455 --> 01:11:20,945
It's going to take a while, man.

1492
01:11:21,023 --> 01:11:22,888
You're going to pick up
some hobbies along the way.

1493
01:11:22,959 --> 01:11:24,449
You're going to probably
going to do a lot...

1494
01:11:24,527 --> 01:11:25,585
You're going to become
a chronic masturbator.

1495
01:11:25,661 --> 01:11:26,958
And then eventually,
you're going to be like,

1496
01:11:27,029 --> 01:11:28,257
"Holy shit, should I put on a blue shirt,

1497
01:11:28,331 --> 01:11:30,196
or should I kill myself?"

1498
01:11:30,266 --> 01:11:32,063
I alWays put on the shirt.

1499
01:11:32,134 --> 01:11:34,261
So, fucking irony of ironies,

1500
01:11:34,337 --> 01:11:36,328
here I am with a head injury,

1501
01:11:36,405 --> 01:11:39,067
uh, top dog
in the Shenaniganz world.

1502
01:11:39,141 --> 01:11:40,699
And noW what I'm going to do is

1503
01:11:40,776 --> 01:11:43,574
trample on the soul
of a middle-aged man.

1504
01:11:43,646 --> 01:11:46,774
Which sadly, is one of the only joys
that I have left in my life.

1505
01:11:48,818 --> 01:11:50,911
That and, um, as I said,

1506
01:11:50,987 --> 01:11:53,717
Internet porn and OxyContin.

1507
01:11:53,789 --> 01:11:56,155
Tell you what I'm not going to do.

1508
01:11:56,225 --> 01:11:58,523
I'm not paying for that drink.

1509
01:11:58,594 --> 01:11:59,720
Thanks, man.

1510
01:11:59,795 --> 01:12:00,887
Okay.

1511
01:12:04,533 --> 01:12:06,364
You don't deserve
an ugly bastard stepchild.

1512
01:12:06,435 --> 01:12:09,700
Well, well, well.

1513
01:12:09,772 --> 01:12:11,569
You kneW the score, and you let me doWn.

1514
01:12:11,641 --> 01:12:13,074
And you knoW what that means?

1515
01:12:13,142 --> 01:12:15,007
It means you tarnished the uniform.

1516
01:12:15,077 --> 01:12:16,374
I knoW what it means, Dan.

1517
01:12:16,445 --> 01:12:17,673
It means you don't have

1518
01:12:17,747 --> 01:12:19,044
What it takes to handle district.

1519
01:12:20,249 --> 01:12:21,273
- Get up.
- Sit doWn, dude.

1520
01:12:21,350 --> 01:12:24,410
Sit doWn. Hey, Dean.

1521
01:12:24,487 --> 01:12:25,784
Mr. Shull, okay?

1522
01:12:25,855 --> 01:12:27,755
You don't get
to call me Dean anymore.

1523
01:12:27,823 --> 01:12:30,792
You got some mayonnaise or semen
on the collar of your shirt.

1524
01:12:30,860 --> 01:12:34,023
Listen, Dennis, I'm really sorry, but...

1525
01:12:35,798 --> 01:12:37,595
I'm sorry it didn't work out.

1526
01:12:37,667 --> 01:12:39,157
It looks like you're
going to be store manager

1527
01:12:39,235 --> 01:12:42,727
for a feW more years,
and I do apologize about that.

1528
01:12:42,805 --> 01:12:45,501
But, uh, if Dan here
is any inspiration,

1529
01:12:45,574 --> 01:12:47,007
you knoW, you can, uh,

1530
01:12:47,076 --> 01:12:50,409
certainly learn a lot from his incompetence.

1531
01:12:50,479 --> 01:12:51,878
That's right.

1532
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:53,881
Not a compliment, Dan.

1533
01:12:53,949 --> 01:12:55,541
Whenever you get
doWn about yourself,

1534
01:12:55,618 --> 01:12:57,279
Whenever you have
moments of self-doubt,

1535
01:12:57,353 --> 01:12:59,821
just look over here and say,
"It could be worse. "

1536
01:12:59,889 --> 01:13:01,083
- Thank you.
- I mean that, man.

1537
01:13:01,157 --> 01:13:02,215
Well, thank you.

1538
01:13:02,291 --> 01:13:03,519
I have a lot of pity on you.

1539
01:13:04,593 --> 01:13:05,821
Okay, well,

1540
01:13:05,895 --> 01:13:06,987
that was a good trip.

1541
01:13:07,063 --> 01:13:09,088
I need, uh, I actually
need some money.

1542
01:13:09,165 --> 01:13:10,962
Cash, right noW, if you could.

1543
01:13:11,033 --> 01:13:12,762
- $20 would do it.
- I got a...

1544
01:13:12,835 --> 01:13:14,268
- I need about 20.
- $20?

1545
01:13:14,336 --> 01:13:17,066
Make it a 50. Just round up.
Make it an even 50.

1546
01:13:17,139 --> 01:13:18,504
That'll make it easier for me.

1547
01:13:18,574 --> 01:13:20,371
Um, sure.

1548
01:13:20,443 --> 01:13:22,274
Perfect. Ask, and ye shall receive.

1549
01:13:22,344 --> 01:13:23,641
Ulysses S. Grant,

1550
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:25,681
Where the fuck did my life go wrong?

1551
01:13:25,748 --> 01:13:27,613
So you think we made it?

1552
01:13:28,784 --> 01:13:30,308
Place seemed pretty busy, right?

1553
01:13:30,386 --> 01:13:31,876
We're screWed.

1554
01:13:31,954 --> 01:13:33,854
You bitches better be
dusting off your résumés.

1555
01:13:33,923 --> 01:13:35,891
Shit, I need this job.

1556
01:13:35,958 --> 01:13:37,516
Well, you knoW Ta-Ta's is hiring.

1557
01:13:37,593 --> 01:13:39,083
They're looking for bus boys.

1558
01:13:39,161 --> 01:13:41,152
Asian schoolboy busboys.

1559
01:13:42,665 --> 01:13:44,292
Well, guys,

1560
01:13:44,366 --> 01:13:46,834
We had a great night tonight.

1561
01:13:46,902 --> 01:13:49,132
We set a franchise record tonight.

1562
01:13:49,205 --> 01:13:50,638
Yes!

1563
01:13:50,706 --> 01:13:53,004
My God. I told you.

1564
01:13:53,075 --> 01:13:57,171
All right. Unfortunately,
it was not, uh, enough.

1565
01:13:57,246 --> 01:13:59,646
We didn't make the mark.
We came in at 7,200.

1566
01:13:59,715 --> 01:14:01,046
- what?
- what that mean, man?

1567
01:14:02,518 --> 01:14:03,815
God, I'm screWed.

1568
01:14:03,886 --> 01:14:06,821
I'm so screWed.

1569
01:14:06,889 --> 01:14:07,947
Fuck, so the restaurant's closing?

1570
01:14:08,023 --> 01:14:09,320
No.

1571
01:14:11,193 --> 01:14:15,186
I mean, the restaurant
is not closing doWn.

1572
01:14:15,264 --> 01:14:17,255
The restaurant...

1573
01:14:18,734 --> 01:14:19,826
The restaurant was never...

1574
01:14:19,902 --> 01:14:22,200
Dennis, what the fuck
are you talking about?

1575
01:14:22,271 --> 01:14:23,568
- You lied to us...
- Are you fucking with us?

1576
01:14:25,374 --> 01:14:31,574
The restaurant isn't closing doWn
because I paid the difference.

1577
01:14:31,647 --> 01:14:33,137
- what?
- Really?

1578
01:14:33,215 --> 01:14:36,048
You paid $1,800 out of your oWn pocket?

1579
01:14:36,118 --> 01:14:38,245
You live with your mom.

1580
01:14:38,320 --> 01:14:40,413
I couldn't let them
shut this place doWn

1581
01:14:40,489 --> 01:14:42,514
When we were this close to the mark!

1582
01:14:42,591 --> 01:14:44,115
This close to making it all the way

1583
01:14:44,193 --> 01:14:45,956
to the top of the thermometer?

1584
01:14:46,028 --> 01:14:47,393
HoW could I let that go by?

1585
01:14:47,463 --> 01:14:50,899
I'm going to wind up
in the gutter again,

1586
01:14:50,966 --> 01:14:52,831
sucking meth for dick.

1587
01:14:52,902 --> 01:14:54,392
This restaurant stays open,

1588
01:14:54,470 --> 01:14:56,870
and I am going to be its manager.

1589
01:14:56,939 --> 01:14:59,203
Of this restaurant.

1590
01:14:59,275 --> 01:15:01,072
Just this one.

1591
01:15:11,821 --> 01:15:13,220
Hey.

1592
01:15:13,289 --> 01:15:15,780
Dennis, um, we are going out,

1593
01:15:15,858 --> 01:15:19,021
and I thought maybe
you'd want to join us.

1594
01:15:19,094 --> 01:15:22,086
- Do you wanna come?
- Really?

1595
01:15:22,164 --> 01:15:23,392
Yeah, really.

1596
01:15:33,709 --> 01:15:34,937
Is that a yes?

1597
01:15:36,445 --> 01:15:37,810
Well, I have a lot to do,

1598
01:15:37,880 --> 01:15:39,245
so I'm... I'll check my schedule.

1599
01:15:39,315 --> 01:15:40,680
Okay.

1600
01:15:41,851 --> 01:15:42,818
Yes.

1601
01:15:42,885 --> 01:15:44,512
He can maybe come.

1602
01:15:46,288 --> 01:15:48,313
Well, so, I told you,

1603
01:15:48,390 --> 01:15:49,982
everything does happen
for a reason, right?

1604
01:15:50,059 --> 01:15:51,890
ScreW Ta-Ta's.

1605
01:15:51,961 --> 01:15:53,053
Yeah!

1606
01:15:53,128 --> 01:15:54,390
ScreW Ta-Ta's.

1607
01:15:54,463 --> 01:15:57,057
Calvin wouldn't knoW a pair of tits
if it raped him in the woods.

1608
01:15:57,132 --> 01:15:59,464
I mean, seriously, you guys!

1609
01:15:59,535 --> 01:16:00,729
Take a look at these!

1610
01:16:00,803 --> 01:16:02,168
- whoa!
- Oh, Jesus!

1611
01:16:02,238 --> 01:16:04,035
Yeah!

1612
01:16:04,106 --> 01:16:05,937
Motherfucker, hoW'd you
like these apples?

1613
01:16:06,008 --> 01:16:10,274
Yeah, man.

1614
01:16:11,580 --> 01:16:13,172
That's what you want to do.

1615
01:16:13,249 --> 01:16:14,944
Yeah. Yeah.

1616
01:16:16,185 --> 01:16:19,348
WoW. Those are beautiful.

1617
01:16:19,421 --> 01:16:21,685
Hey, uh...

1618
01:16:21,757 --> 01:16:26,160
Heck, why don't you and I
go get a drink?

1619
01:16:26,228 --> 01:16:29,322
- Oh, man.
- Get out.

1620
01:16:29,398 --> 01:16:31,423
What'd you say?

1621
01:16:33,335 --> 01:16:36,736
You said "Get out"?

1622
01:16:36,805 --> 01:16:39,069
What are you pointing at?
What does that mean?

1623
01:16:39,141 --> 01:16:40,836
You're pointing at...

1624
01:16:42,378 --> 01:16:44,505
Did you leave something...
What's going on?

1625
01:16:44,580 --> 01:16:46,605
Guys don't play hard-to-get.

1626
01:16:46,682 --> 01:16:48,274
Yeah, they do.

1627
01:16:48,350 --> 01:16:49,681
- They don't?
- No.

1628
01:16:51,020 --> 01:16:53,545
- Hey.
- Oh, hey, babe.

1629
01:16:53,622 --> 01:16:55,055
I got, like, another half hour.

1630
01:16:55,124 --> 01:16:56,386
Get a drink at the bar, if you want.

1631
01:16:56,458 --> 01:16:57,925
Yeah, um, actually,

1632
01:16:57,993 --> 01:16:59,858
I think you're gonna need
to find another ride home.

1633
01:17:01,597 --> 01:17:03,155
What the hell are you talking about?

1634
01:17:03,232 --> 01:17:05,700
I just realized you're
not good enough for me.

1635
01:17:05,768 --> 01:17:09,067
We both kneW that.
That never stopped you before.

1636
01:17:11,006 --> 01:17:13,201
Hey, baby. You ready to go?

1637
01:17:13,275 --> 01:17:15,004
I sure am.

1638
01:17:15,077 --> 01:17:16,339
What the hell?

1639
01:17:22,484 --> 01:17:23,712
Don't worry about it.

1640
01:17:23,786 --> 01:17:25,549
It's probably just sex.

1641
01:17:36,332 --> 01:17:38,823
She was in Milan

1642
01:17:38,901 --> 01:17:40,528
Struttin' for Dior

1643
01:17:40,602 --> 01:17:43,469
I was in Iraq

1644
01:17:43,539 --> 01:17:45,734
Fightin' a little war

1645
01:17:45,808 --> 01:17:47,469
- Doing the best I could
- There you go.

1646
01:17:47,543 --> 01:17:49,909
- Thank you very much.
- To keep America free

1647
01:17:49,979 --> 01:17:52,209
Put it on his check.

1648
01:17:53,215 --> 01:17:56,207
- Yeah.
- Very nice, Dennis.

1649
01:17:56,285 --> 01:17:59,118
You're good at that, you little broWn guy.

1650
01:18:00,656 --> 01:18:03,147
What blue eyes

1651
01:18:03,225 --> 01:18:05,659
Love meeting people playing pool.

1652
01:18:06,895 --> 01:18:09,227
Oh, you need to make a shot.
I'm so sorry.

1653
01:18:09,298 --> 01:18:10,663
Kind of got me in the gut.

1654
01:18:10,733 --> 01:18:12,598
- I think I've got a neW recipe.
- There he is.

1655
01:18:12,668 --> 01:18:14,295
It's a mushroom stuffed with ziti.

1656
01:18:14,370 --> 01:18:15,496
- Hey, man. HoW you doing?
- Hey.

1657
01:18:15,571 --> 01:18:16,629
- You all right?
- Yeah.

1658
01:18:16,705 --> 01:18:17,797
Stay cool, kid. See you.

1659
01:18:17,873 --> 01:18:19,135
Yeah, okay. All right.

1660
01:18:19,208 --> 01:18:21,699
Okay. All right!

1661
01:18:25,814 --> 01:18:27,441
AlloW me.

1662
01:18:29,284 --> 01:18:31,752
Hello. My name's Stan.

1663
01:18:31,820 --> 01:18:33,219
What can I get you to drink?

1664
01:18:33,288 --> 01:18:34,414
A shot of tequila.

1665
01:18:34,490 --> 01:18:38,290
Well, that's great, isn't it?

1666
01:18:38,360 --> 01:18:39,884
Make it tWo.

1667
01:18:39,962 --> 01:18:41,520
All right, then. Hold on.

1668
01:18:42,765 --> 01:18:43,959
Seriously, guys.

1669
01:18:44,033 --> 01:18:46,501
I'm... I'm sorry. You knoW?

1670
01:18:46,568 --> 01:18:48,263
I suck.

1671
01:18:48,337 --> 01:18:49,361
I pussied out.

1672
01:18:49,438 --> 01:18:50,769
I knoW you guys were only kidding

1673
01:18:50,839 --> 01:18:52,272
With the sour cream Sanchez thing,

1674
01:18:52,341 --> 01:18:53,899
and I took it personally,

1675
01:18:53,976 --> 01:18:58,675
so put a quarter in my ass
'cause I played myself.

1676
01:18:58,747 --> 01:18:59,907
Hi.

1677
01:18:59,982 --> 01:19:01,313
There you go, miss.

1678
01:19:01,383 --> 01:19:03,317
Hey. Amber, is it?

1679
01:19:03,385 --> 01:19:05,979
I think I've heard about... Hello?

1680
01:19:06,055 --> 01:19:07,215
Went to the...

1681
01:19:08,857 --> 01:19:11,485
It wasn't the fryer that was
so overwhelming, you knoW?

1682
01:19:11,560 --> 01:19:13,960
It was those fucking
French onion soups

1683
01:19:14,029 --> 01:19:15,963
that you stick in the goddamn toaster.

1684
01:19:16,031 --> 01:19:17,464
Aye. God.

1685
01:19:17,533 --> 01:19:20,093
For God's sake, cunt bastard.
Do you knoW who I am?

1686
01:19:20,169 --> 01:19:21,830
And I've got delicate hands, man.

1687
01:19:21,904 --> 01:19:24,896
I think, you knoW,
I've got the princest.

1688
01:19:28,410 --> 01:19:29,638
Hello.

1689
01:19:29,711 --> 01:19:33,647
HoW come you've never
talked to me before?

1690
01:19:33,715 --> 01:19:36,980
I mean, really talk to me?

1691
01:19:37,052 --> 01:19:39,850
We've worked together
five or six times,

1692
01:19:39,922 --> 01:19:42,584
and I never even kneW
you spoke like that.

1693
01:19:44,860 --> 01:19:45,849
No.

1694
01:19:47,830 --> 01:19:48,922
I love it.

1695
01:19:48,997 --> 01:19:51,625
I love the way you talk.

1696
01:19:53,135 --> 01:19:54,966
I just can't believe I never kneW.

1697
01:19:55,037 --> 01:19:59,167
Most people don't think
it's as cool as you do.

1698
01:19:59,241 --> 01:20:00,572
So...

1699
01:20:01,577 --> 01:20:04,512
Wait a second.

1700
01:20:04,580 --> 01:20:05,945
You're fuckin' with me, right?

1701
01:20:06,014 --> 01:20:08,676
Chuck put you up to this?
Goddamn.

1702
01:20:08,750 --> 01:20:10,274
You're not gonna smear sour cream
on my upper lip, are you?

1703
01:20:10,352 --> 01:20:12,047
I got a lactose prob...

1704
01:20:20,729 --> 01:20:23,562
I just got some kind bud.

1705
01:20:23,632 --> 01:20:25,725
Do you want to go back
to my place and smoke out?

1706
01:20:25,801 --> 01:20:27,496
Oh, my God.

1707
01:20:27,569 --> 01:20:28,866
Yeah.

1708
01:20:28,937 --> 01:20:30,802
Uh, okay.

1709
01:20:36,011 --> 01:20:37,774
Goddamn it.

1710
01:20:37,846 --> 01:20:39,837
You can do this.

1711
01:20:39,915 --> 01:20:42,611
Separate the pussy from the chaff.

1712
01:20:59,234 --> 01:21:03,136
Winner, winner, chicken dinner.

1713
01:21:07,109 --> 01:21:08,235
Hey, you.

1714
01:21:08,310 --> 01:21:11,575
You mind if I sit doWn?

1715
01:21:11,647 --> 01:21:13,842
Naomi.

1716
01:21:16,151 --> 01:21:18,585
Hey, uh,

1717
01:21:18,654 --> 01:21:20,849
you ready to get back
on the floor as a server?

1718
01:21:20,923 --> 01:21:22,914
I guess you've done enough
time at the door, right?

1719
01:21:22,991 --> 01:21:25,619
I think you've had enough
time being a dick hole.

1720
01:21:26,728 --> 01:21:29,424
That's not very nice.

1721
01:21:29,498 --> 01:21:31,159
I was going to say
you look pretty tonight.

1722
01:21:50,852 --> 01:21:52,786
Hey.

1723
01:21:52,854 --> 01:21:54,981
- Hey, that's my...
- Hey, hey.

1724
01:21:55,057 --> 01:21:56,046
That's my mouth.

1725
01:21:56,124 --> 01:21:57,216
Hey.

1726
01:22:12,374 --> 01:22:14,740
- Hey.
- Hey, Cal.

1727
01:22:14,810 --> 01:22:16,334
Hey. So, uh, let's
get out of here, huh?

1728
01:22:16,411 --> 01:22:17,776
Let's go back to my house.

1729
01:22:17,846 --> 01:22:20,974
I was thinking we could, uh,
do some drugs, right?

1730
01:22:21,049 --> 01:22:22,710
And make... make out with each other.

1731
01:22:24,219 --> 01:22:27,313
There's something
different about you.

1732
01:22:27,389 --> 01:22:29,448
You got a haircut.

1733
01:22:29,524 --> 01:22:30,616
No. Same hair.

1734
01:22:30,692 --> 01:22:32,057
Just I got my hat on.

1735
01:22:32,127 --> 01:22:33,788
That's what it is. It's the hat.

1736
01:22:33,862 --> 01:22:36,558
It's pretty slick, huh?

1737
01:22:36,632 --> 01:22:38,395
Why, is it not slick?
Is something wrong?

1738
01:22:38,467 --> 01:22:39,991
Listen, I'm going to stay here

1739
01:22:40,068 --> 01:22:41,865
and listen to the band
a little longer.

1740
01:22:41,937 --> 01:22:45,532
Why don't you call me later?
Maybe I'll come by. Okay?

1741
01:22:45,607 --> 01:22:46,596
What?

1742
01:22:46,675 --> 01:22:50,111
Maybe you'll come by?

1743
01:22:50,178 --> 01:22:52,203
I have drugs.

1744
01:23:14,336 --> 01:23:16,065
Does that say "PUD"?

1745
01:23:16,138 --> 01:23:18,265
Oh, my God.
HoW'd that get there?

1746
01:23:19,374 --> 01:23:20,898
Fuck it.

1747
01:23:20,976 --> 01:23:23,206
- whoa!
- Fuck you, loser.

1748
01:23:26,448 --> 01:23:28,416
- Piss in my asshole!
- No.

1749
01:23:28,483 --> 01:23:30,246
Shit in my mouth.

1750
01:24:00,315 --> 01:24:04,875
What the fuck?

1751
01:24:04,953 --> 01:24:08,184
- Jesus Christ.
- L...

1752
01:24:09,758 --> 01:24:11,123
That's your dick.

1753
01:24:12,461 --> 01:24:14,725
This is my vagina.

1754
01:24:16,965 --> 01:24:19,229
I- I got to go.

1755
01:24:19,301 --> 01:24:20,962
W- what are you doing?
What are you doing?

1756
01:24:21,036 --> 01:24:23,061
What are you doing?

1757
01:24:23,138 --> 01:24:26,665
I thought maybe that
noW that you're sober,

1758
01:24:26,742 --> 01:24:29,472
you knoW, we could do it again and...

1759
01:24:31,480 --> 01:24:34,074
Sorry.

1760
01:24:34,149 --> 01:24:36,117
- All right, fuck it.
- whoa.

1761
01:24:40,889 --> 01:24:42,049
I have a kidney problem.

1762
01:24:42,124 --> 01:24:43,887
Even better.

1763
01:24:46,995 --> 01:24:48,121
I used to drink 40s

1764
01:24:48,196 --> 01:24:49,493
But I hated the taste

1765
01:24:49,564 --> 01:24:52,055
Put tWists in my hair
because I hated my race

1766
01:24:52,134 --> 01:24:54,364
I hated my face
When I looked in the mirror

1767
01:24:54,436 --> 01:24:56,802
Things were fuzzy,
but noW they're much clearer

1768
01:24:56,872 --> 01:24:59,340
Mirror, mirror on the wall

1769
01:24:59,408 --> 01:25:01,968
Who's the dopest rapper
With the biggest black balls?

1770
01:25:02,043 --> 01:25:04,238
Not you or me, because
We're white, remember?

1771
01:25:04,312 --> 01:25:07,110
We're whiter than Santa Claus'
pubes in December

1772
01:25:07,182 --> 01:25:09,480
Socrates said
be as you wish to seem

1773
01:25:09,551 --> 01:25:11,781
I guess I wish to seem
like a fat black teen

1774
01:25:11,853 --> 01:25:14,378
I don't got a gangsta lean,
I got scoliosis

1775
01:25:14,456 --> 01:25:17,391
I say corny phrases like "Holy Moses"

1776
01:25:17,459 --> 01:25:19,359
"Holy Moses" or "Holy Jesus"

1777
01:25:19,428 --> 01:25:22,056
Can't decipher the universe,
there's so many pieces

1778
01:25:22,130 --> 01:25:24,621
But it doesn't make sense
because "uni" means one

1779
01:25:24,699 --> 01:25:27,065
So we're trapped in one verse
that revolves around the sun

1780
01:25:27,135 --> 01:25:29,160
And since "E equals MC squared"

1781
01:25:29,237 --> 01:25:32,070
That means we're tWo MCs
but our brain is shared

1782
01:25:32,140 --> 01:25:35,405
Shared, shared, shared

1783
01:25:37,412 --> 01:25:40,142
We're whiter than Santa Claus'
pubes in December

1784
01:25:42,184 --> 01:25:44,914
We're whiter than Santa Claus'
pubes in December

1785
01:25:47,456 --> 01:25:49,856
Just 'cause we're smart
doesn't mean we're not gross

1786
01:25:49,925 --> 01:25:52,485
I'll spread your pussy lips
for Shenaniganz toast

1787
01:25:52,561 --> 01:25:54,529
Yum, pussy toast,
pussy, pussy, pussy toast

1788
01:25:54,596 --> 01:25:57,360
I kill that pussy,
then fuck your pussy's ghost

1789
01:25:57,432 --> 01:25:59,696
Your clitoris is longer
than a magic beanstalk

1790
01:25:59,768 --> 01:26:02,134
When I climb to the top,
a giant suck my mean cock

1791
01:26:02,204 --> 01:26:03,694
I'm the Van Gogh of rhyming

1792
01:26:03,772 --> 01:26:05,069
I cut up my oWn hymen

1793
01:26:05,140 --> 01:26:07,472
Three fingers in,
but soon I'll have five in

1794
01:26:07,542 --> 01:26:09,908
I come so much,
you'll be slippin' and slidin'

1795
01:26:09,978 --> 01:26:12,469
My dick's higher on
the "Wanted" list than bin Laden

1796
01:26:12,547 --> 01:26:14,981
I fuck mad ducks 'cause
I'm addicted to quack

1797
01:26:15,050 --> 01:26:17,348
And they eat stale bread
right off my fat back

1798
01:26:17,419 --> 01:26:20,081
It's okay if you're chubby,
that's why they got lipo

1799
01:26:20,155 --> 01:26:22,555
I'll suck your back fat
then I'll spit it at a white ho

1800
01:26:22,624 --> 01:26:25,218
Got to stop bangin'
those psycho dyke hos

1801
01:26:25,293 --> 01:26:26,385
When I was 5 years old

1802
01:26:26,461 --> 01:26:27,689
I was fuckin' on my trike, yo

1803
01:26:27,762 --> 01:26:29,923
My cum is stickier than Krazy Glue

1804
01:26:29,998 --> 01:26:32,398
Girl, you wearing contacts,
your eyes are crazy blue

1805
01:26:32,467 --> 01:26:35,061
I give bitches OCD,
then they won't let me go

1806
01:26:35,136 --> 01:26:36,364
'Cause they need to have my dick

1807
01:26:36,438 --> 01:26:37,632
Three times in a roW

1808
01:26:37,706 --> 01:26:40,197
Damn, three in a roW
like Tic-Tac-Toe

1809
01:26:40,275 --> 01:26:42,766
I'll make your face red
'cause I'm a dick-smack pro

1810
01:26:42,844 --> 01:26:45,244
You're good at riding dick
but let's talk about BJs

1811
01:26:45,313 --> 01:26:47,440
Your technique's sloppy
like amateur DJs

1812
01:26:47,516 --> 01:26:50,349
Well, my girl does it right,
she drinks all my babies

1813
01:26:50,418 --> 01:26:53,046
Her mouth full of foam
'cause she got slut rabies

1814
01:26:57,792 --> 01:27:00,420
Yum, pussy toast,
pussy, pussy, pussy toast

1815
01:27:02,697 --> 01:27:05,063
Yum, pussy toast,
pussy, pussy, pussy toast

1816
01:27:07,969 --> 01:27:10,130
Just 'cause we're gross
doesn't mean we're not smart

1817
01:27:10,205 --> 01:27:12,901
Got a dog named Napoleon,
he cheWs my boner-part

1818
01:27:12,974 --> 01:27:14,908
No, that shit doesn't
matter, matter, matter

1819
01:27:14,976 --> 01:27:18,002
You constellations of sperm
to see the universe splatter

1820
01:27:18,079 --> 01:27:20,377
I fucked a black hole
to see my dick disappear

1821
01:27:20,448 --> 01:27:22,973
Into a multidimensional creature's ear

1822
01:27:23,051 --> 01:27:25,315
On a subatomic level, man,
you're being kind of gay

1823
01:27:25,387 --> 01:27:27,685
Get your ShoMoFo tongue
in your mouth all day?

1824
01:27:27,756 --> 01:27:30,589
We're just a pale blue dot
suspended in a sunbeam

1825
01:27:30,659 --> 01:27:32,024
Fuckin' bars of soap

1826
01:27:32,093 --> 01:27:33,822
'Cause it's time for us to come clean

1827
01:27:37,566 --> 01:27:41,195
I fucked a black hole
to see my dick disappear

1828
01:27:41,269 --> 01:27:42,668
I fucked a black hole

1829
01:27:42,737 --> 01:27:46,969
I fucked a black hole
to see my dick disappear

1830
01:27:47,042 --> 01:27:48,873
I fucked a black hole

1831
01:28:00,822 --> 01:28:05,156
Keep stoned for days.
Suck a duck, yo.

1832
01:28:07,796 --> 01:28:09,320
Fuck you.

1833

Subtitled By J.R. Media Services, Inc.
Burbank, CA

1834
01:28:32,454 --> 01:28:34,251
- Quit it. Stop it.
- I knoW.

1835
01:28:36,224 --> 01:28:39,216
Who the fuck are any of you
to laugh at me?

1836
01:28:39,294 --> 01:28:42,991
Huh? AgneW! You big-eared,
Cro-Magnon Aryan fuck!

1837
01:28:43,064 --> 01:28:46,864
Why are you so racist?
Using the "N" word isn't cool.

1838
01:28:46,935 --> 01:28:48,960
I don't use the "N" word.

1839
01:28:49,037 --> 01:28:51,130
Oh, yeah, good one.

1840
01:28:51,206 --> 01:28:52,468
And you!

1841
01:28:52,540 --> 01:28:54,405
You walk into a place, everyone's like,

1842
01:28:54,476 --> 01:28:56,671
"Oh, he's hardcore. "
You play world of warcraft, all right?

1843
01:28:56,745 --> 01:28:58,337
You probably haven't
even stolen anything.

1844
01:28:58,413 --> 01:29:01,348
You motherfucker!
I hope you burn in hell!

1845
01:29:01,416 --> 01:29:03,111
Yeah!

1846
01:29:03,184 --> 01:29:04,651
Easy, JeW.

1847
01:29:04,719 --> 01:29:06,550
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
I'm a musician.

1848
01:29:12,060 --> 01:29:14,528
Yeah!

1849
01:29:16,731 --> 01:29:18,562
Yes! Come to me.

1850
01:29:18,633 --> 01:29:20,032
Come to me, ladies.

1851
01:29:20,101 --> 01:29:21,864
Yes. Oh, God.

1852
01:29:21,936 --> 01:29:23,961
Oh. Rub my chest. Rub my chest.

1853
01:29:24,039 --> 01:29:25,597
Yeah!
