00:01:02,046 --> 00:01:04,614
We're late.

3
00:01:15,193 --> 00:01:18,361
Right.

4
00:01:46,257 --> 00:01:48,059
Silly.

5
00:01:48,793 --> 00:01:50,694

You're funny daddy.

(Blows bubbles)

13
00:02:19,290 --> 00:02:20,925
Do you want cream?

14
00:02:23,727 --> 00:02:25,462
It's how I take it.

15
00:02:31,601 --> 00:02:33,971
Maybe you wanted to try
something different.

16
00:02:43,480 --> 00:02:46,650
(Inaudible sounds from subway)

17
00:02:59,297 --> 00:03:00,831
You need directions?

18
00:03:00,965 --> 00:03:01,431
What?

19
00:03:01,564 --> 00:03:02,833
Directions.

20
00:03:02,967 --> 00:03:04,567
Um, yeah sure, where do you
need to go?

21
00:03:04,701 --> 00:03:05,937
No, you just look like you need

22
00:03:06,070 --> 00:03:08,438
Oh no, no... I'm good. I'm good
Thank you.

23
00:03:08,571 --> 00:03:09,273
Okay!

24
00:03:10,041 --> 00:03:13,811

26
00:03:21,786 --> 00:03:23,988
Hey Ethan, it's... me. I'm

00:03:24,121 --> 00:03:26,690

So, talk to you later. Bye.

30
00:03:48,545 --> 00:03:50,815
Are you following me?

31
00:03:52,549 --> 00:03:54,452
Guess I am following you.

32
00:03:54,684 --> 00:03:56,220
You must be Amber.

33
00:03:56,354 --> 00:03:59,323
Oh... you're Logan...

34
00:03:59,522 --> 00:04:00,690

35
00:04:00,825 --> 00:04:03,461

37
00:04:08,565 --> 00:04:10,434
Well, it's nice to meet you...
again.

38
00:04:10,567 --> 00:04:12,837
You too. Right this way...

39
00:04:13,270 --> 00:04:14,704
But if you are looking for
something

40
00:04:14,839 --> 00:04:16,941
bigger, I have another place

41
00:04:17,074 --> 00:04:18,508

42
00:04:18,641 --> 00:04:19,576

45
00:04:25,316 --> 00:04:26,317
Sorry about that-

46
00:04:26,450 --> 00:04:27,418
I just saw the wedding band...

47
00:04:27,550 --> 00:04:28,452
You now what?

48
00:04:28,585 --> 00:04:30,454
I love it... I'll take it.

49
00:04:30,821 --> 00:04:32,890
Okay! Great.

50
00:04:33,024 --> 00:04:34,825
Let's set up an appointment

51
00:04:34,959 --> 00:04:36,559
get the paperwork done.

52
00:04:37,660 --> 00:04:39,729
Perfect.

53
00:04:40,765 --> 00:04:43,934
(Sound of rain falling)

54
00:04:58,983 --> 00:04:59,483

55
00:04:59,616 --> 00:05:00,284
Hi.

56
00:05:04,321 --> 00:05:05,189
Ethan...

57
00:05:05,456 --> 00:05:07,758
I know... she's taking a nap.

58
00:05:20,771 --> 00:05:22,173
I need to talk to you.

59
00:05:22,672 --> 00:05:23,673
Okay...

60
00:05:26,277 --> 00:05:28,145
It's important.

61
00:05:33,616 --> 00:05:35,019
What?

62
00:05:38,389 --> 00:05:40,091
(Typing sounds)

63
00:05:47,465 --> 00:05:49,767
Ethan I'm leaving you.

64
00:06:03,380 --> 00:06:06,150
(Exhales) What?

65
00:06:11,222 --> 00:06:12,823
I'm sorry.

66
00:06:18,095 --> 00:06:19,997
Stop.

67
00:06:21,799 --> 00:06:23,934
Don't... uh..

68
00:06:25,702 --> 00:06:28,671
...take another step towards me

69
00:06:31,708 --> 00:06:34,011
We should talk about this.

70
00:06:36,347 --> 00:06:38,149
The logistics...

71
00:06:39,649 --> 00:06:41,385
...Emily.

72
00:06:44,889 --> 00:06:47,091
Do not...

73
00:06:50,561 --> 00:06:53,130
...do not take another step.

74
00:06:59,336 --> 00:07:02,672
I'll be out by the end of
the month.

75

These things happen Gracie.

80

They happen all the time.

81
00:08:07,605 --> 00:08:09,173
It'll be okay.

82
00:08:10,341 --> 00:08:12,343
Okay?

83
00:08:12,876 --> 00:08:14,511

You got all your boxes
mommy?

87
00:08:22,853 --> 00:08:23,954
I got all my boxes

88
00:08:24,221 --> 00:08:26,757
and I'm gonna take them
to my new house

89
00:08:27,458 --> 00:08:29,360
which is going to be our
new house.

90
00:08:29,493 --> 00:08:30,995
Like we talked about.

91
00:08:31,528 --> 00:08:33,230
With daddy.

92
00:08:35,099 --> 00:08:37,901
No... no, not with daddy.

93
00:08:39,403 --> 00:08:41,639
Daddy's gonna stay in our
old house

94
00:08:41,772 --> 00:08:43,207
You're gonna have

95
00:08:43,340 --> 00:08:45,576
two homes now, you're
gonna have daddy's

96
00:08:45,709 --> 00:08:46,744
home and mommy's home.

97
00:08:46,877 --> 00:08:49,046
I don't want two homes.

98
00:08:50,614 --> 00:08:52,349
I know...

99
00:08:53,484 --> 00:08:55,754
I'm sad about it too.

100
00:08:56,453 --> 00:08:58,956
It's okay to have sad feelings
about it.

101
00:08:59,857 --> 00:09:03,027
I don't want you to go away.

102
00:09:13,237 --> 00:09:16,407
I'm gonna miss you
so much babygirl.

103
00:09:17,841 --> 00:09:21,045
But... when you're not with
daddy you're gonna be with me

104
00:09:22,079 --> 00:09:24,315
four whole days a week.

105
00:09:24,948 --> 00:09:26,750
Like a sleepover?

106
00:09:26,884 --> 00:09:28,452
(laughs)

107
00:09:28,787 --> 00:09:30,521
The best sleepover's ever.

108
00:09:31,522 --> 00:09:34,024
I love you mommy.

109
00:09:34,825 --> 00:09:37,661

I'm gonna go now, okay?

112
00:09:40,597 --> 00:09:41,598
Here we go Em-

113
00:09:41,732 --> 00:09:42,966
See you in a few days.

114
00:09:43,100 --> 00:09:44,201
What do you say you come

115
00:09:44,335 --> 00:09:46,470

120
00:10:10,928 --> 00:10:12,129
Was...

121
00:10:12,329 --> 00:10:14,298

122
00:10:14,865 --> 00:10:16,333

a summons

126
00:10:24,074 --> 00:10:26,076

127
00:10:27,745 --> 00:10:29,814

Sorry.

Well yeah for now.

163
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,754

Slowly... yeah.

165
00:14:37,795 --> 00:14:39,730
Well it was really great
running into you.

166
00:14:39,864 --> 00:14:40,530
Yeah.

167
00:14:40,664 --> 00:14:41,164
Yeah.

168
00:14:41,298 --> 00:14:43,667
Really great.

169
00:14:46,169 --> 00:14:47,071

170
00:14:47,204 --> 00:14:48,705
Yes thank you.

171
00:14:49,339 --> 00:14:51,475
I'd actually like to buy
you a housewarming gift.

172
00:14:51,608 --> 00:14:54,846
Oh no no you don't have
to do that.

173
00:14:55,712 --> 00:14:57,714
Oh, I just did.

174
00:14:58,950 --> 00:14:59,616
Thank you.

175
00:14:59,750 --> 00:15:00,818
You're welcome.

176
00:15:04,122 --> 00:15:07,491
But it... wouldn't be much of a
housewarming without people.

177
00:15:08,392 --> 00:15:09,927
I suppose not.

178
00:15:11,561 --> 00:15:13,031
You think you can make it?

179
00:15:13,163 --> 00:15:14,398
Sure.

180
00:15:14,531 --> 00:15:17,035
And by that I mean tonight,
like now.

181
00:15:17,234 --> 00:15:18,836
Oh...

182
00:15:18,970 --> 00:15:21,939

183
00:15:22,205 --> 00:15:24,608

Hi.

188
00:15:33,216 --> 00:15:34,451
She's asleep?

189
00:15:34,584 --> 00:15:35,585
Yeah, she couldn't keep her
eyes open.

190

What do you love?

217
00:17:15,987 --> 00:17:17,687
I... um...

218
00:17:17,822 --> 00:17:19,456
I don't think that I've ever
really...

219
00:17:19,589 --> 00:17:21,893
You know, I went to being a
kid to having a kid...

220
00:17:22,026 --> 00:17:24,862
...and then I... out of my
parents house, into

221
00:17:24,996 --> 00:17:27,430
Ethan's house. I'm a mom,
I work, you know I just...

222
00:17:27,999 --> 00:17:29,666
I don't really...

223
00:17:29,801 --> 00:17:32,970
feel like I know the answer
to that.

224
00:17:33,470 --> 00:17:35,539
That's okay.

225
00:17:36,207 --> 00:17:38,843
It's kind of exciting you know?

226
00:17:38,976 --> 00:17:42,013
Cuz' now you get to figure it
out.

227
00:17:43,214 --> 00:17:45,615
Here's to figuring it out.

228
00:18:00,497 --> 00:18:03,366
Look you know, I don't
really know you.

229
00:18:04,902 --> 00:18:07,537
And I don't know what
happened but -

230
00:18:08,306 --> 00:18:11,474
It sounds like it's something
that you really needed to do.

231
00:18:11,608 --> 00:18:14,578
And... not everybody does
that.

232
00:18:18,348 --> 00:18:20,750
I think it's brave.

233
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,689
Brave.

234
00:18:28,793 --> 00:18:30,928

425
00:30:05,790 --> 00:30:07,190
When I was a little girl
my mom and I

426
00:30:07,324 --> 00:30:08,725
used to come to the
beach

427
00:30:09,059 --> 00:30:11,094
and take these long walks
to find

428
00:30:11,695 --> 00:30:13,230
rocks or stones

429
00:30:13,497 --> 00:30:16,400
and then we would assign
some sort of meaning to it.

430
00:30:16,733 --> 00:30:18,101
An emotion or something.

431
00:30:18,468 --> 00:30:20,038
anger, sadness...

432
00:30:20,270 --> 00:30:21,806
...and then we would

433
00:30:22,807 --> 00:30:24,274
throw it into the ocean

434
00:30:24,408 --> 00:30:25,810
as this way of

435
00:30:26,076 --> 00:30:28,412
releasing things we didn't want

436
00:30:32,749 --> 00:30:33,851
I like that.

437
00:30:34,751 --> 00:30:37,521
Did you ever do it for
things that you did want?

438
00:30:38,056 --> 00:30:40,657
Yes, occasionally we would...
make a wish (laughs)

439
00:30:40,925 --> 00:30:43,828
But it was really special
because my mom is just

440
00:30:44,394 --> 00:30:46,764
so practical in so many ways

441
00:30:47,130 --> 00:30:49,299
So whenever we did that
it was...

442
00:30:50,768 --> 00:30:53,604
...it felt like something
magical might happen.

443
00:31:02,245 --> 00:31:05,315
I didn't really have anything
magical like that growing up.

444
00:31:06,818 --> 00:31:09,486
I did have this disappering
mom though

445
00:31:11,956 --> 00:31:14,725
and this really cool key
I wore around my neck

446
00:31:15,258 --> 00:31:16,627
If I used it...

447
00:31:16,828 --> 00:31:19,529
...I could open my front
door.

448
00:31:25,036 --> 00:31:27,872
Magic rocks sound a lot
nicer.

449
00:31:29,941 --> 00:31:30,942
Yeah.

450
00:31:31,375 --> 00:31:33,443
I coulda' used some of
those when I was a kid.

451
00:31:51,963 --> 00:31:53,730
(laughs)

452
00:32:00,337 --> 00:32:01,471

453
00:32:01,605 --> 00:32:02,639

456
00:32:05,208 --> 00:32:06,376
Yeah?

457
00:32:06,710 --> 00:32:09,279
There was a guy on the
subway and he said 'shit'

458
00:32:09,413 --> 00:32:11,481
and daddy told me never
to say that.

459
00:32:11,615 --> 00:32:12,215
Great.

460
00:32:12,516 --> 00:32:14,886

461
00:32:15,585 --> 00:32:16,253

525
00:34:50,975 --> 00:34:53,811

I'm sorry.

535
00:35:55,306 --> 00:35:56,807
We shouldn't do this.

536
00:35:57,141 --> 00:35:58,708
Wait... what?

537
00:35:59,844 --> 00:36:01,444
Why not?

538
00:36:02,612 --> 00:36:04,782
(exhales)

539
00:36:09,653 --> 00:36:12,023
It's just... this is so...

540
00:36:12,156 --> 00:36:13,991
confusing.

541
00:36:14,491 --> 00:36:17,094
because I have all these
feelings for you

542
00:36:19,596 --> 00:36:21,999
I really value our friendship

543
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:26,503
and I'm like, kind of
attracted to you

544
00:36:27,772 --> 00:36:29,974
like really attracted to you

545
00:36:31,075 --> 00:36:31,943
and

546
00:36:33,710 --> 00:36:36,781
I don't know what to
do with that

547
00:36:38,983 --> 00:36:41,551
so maybe it's better
left untouched.

548
00:36:45,957 --> 00:36:46,891
Okay

549
00:36:47,457 --> 00:36:48,926
slow down.

550
00:36:50,428 --> 00:36:52,696
What I'm hearing is

551
00:36:53,530 --> 00:36:55,099
you like me

552
00:36:56,434 --> 00:36:57,935
you want me

553
00:37:02,340 --> 00:37:05,142
and there was this part about
not touching but...

554
00:37:05,876 --> 00:37:08,645
I think we can just strike that
from the record.

555
00:37:12,749 --> 00:37:14,617
I do like you

556
00:37:17,321 --> 00:37:18,990
a lot.

557
00:37:20,291 --> 00:37:21,658
I'm just

558
00:37:23,394 --> 00:37:27,098
overwhelmed by this feeling
that I wanna get closer to you.

559
00:37:33,237 --> 00:37:34,805
Closer

560
00:37:36,539 --> 00:37:38,175
I like that.

561
00:37:42,079 --> 00:37:44,815
Can we just...
take it slow?

562
00:37:48,718 --> 00:37:50,154
Of course.

563
00:38:08,072 --> 00:38:09,807
You know I'm really concerned
about this bill

564
00:38:09,940 --> 00:38:11,308
if this contractor doesn't
come through we...

565
00:38:11,442 --> 00:38:12,343

You don't even do that
to a friend.

755
00:56:01,579 --> 00:56:03,013
I just...

756
00:56:10,821 --> 00:56:12,756
How do you do it?

859
01:02:49,319 --> 01:02:51,655

01:03:09,239 --> 01:03:11,141
I love you.

861
01:03:15,546 --> 01:03:18,215
Can't believe I just said that
but...

862
01:03:20,584 --> 01:03:22,419
I'm sorry, what'd you say?

863
01:03:24,022 --> 01:03:25,556
I said I love you.

864
01:03:25,924 --> 01:03:26,958
One more time.

865
01:03:27,090 --> 01:03:28,725
I said I love you.

866
01:03:28,860 --> 01:03:30,360
(both laughing)

867
01:03:31,896 --> 01:03:33,463
I love you too.

868
01:03:38,569 --> 01:03:40,237
So much.

869
01:03:50,848 --> 01:03:52,349
Okay everybody

870
01:03:52,784 --> 01:03:54,351
find a partner

871
01:03:55,987 --> 01:03:57,922
(mumbles)

872
01:03:58,488 --> 01:04:00,290
I hate these things.

873
01:04:00,858 --> 01:04:02,994
Maybe you should stop
organizing them.

874
01:04:03,126 --> 01:04:06,296
Next we're gonna be asked to
throw ourselves at eachother.

875
01:04:06,496 --> 01:04:09,299
Um, somebody your own
size is good.

876
01:04:09,801 --> 01:04:11,668
You'll do.

877
01:04:13,938 --> 01:04:15,238
Sugar bridges.

878
01:04:15,572 --> 01:04:17,174
So just take a moment

879
01:04:17,307 --> 01:04:19,476
be with your partner, take
them in.

880
01:04:19,610 --> 01:04:21,813
Remember trust is a really
important part of every

881
01:04:21,946 --> 01:04:23,413
workplace relationship.

882
01:04:24,448 --> 01:04:26,784
So you gonna tell me
who's making you glow?

883
01:04:29,486 --> 01:04:31,622
You have a way of saying
things Sol.

884
01:04:31,756 --> 01:04:34,391
Well I know that sex glow when
I see it.

885
01:04:35,325 --> 01:04:36,693
Sex glow?

886
01:04:37,095 --> 01:04:38,763
Okay so, partner A

887
01:04:39,097 --> 01:04:40,798
turn away from partner B

888
01:04:41,331 --> 01:04:43,901
Take one big step away.

889
01:04:44,969 --> 01:04:45,903
Talk.

890
01:04:46,871 --> 01:04:47,604
(Exhales)

891
01:04:49,740 --> 01:04:50,908
I don't know.

892
01:04:51,042 --> 01:04:52,442
Try me.

893
01:04:55,780 --> 01:04:57,048
You know Logan?

894
01:04:57,180 --> 01:04:58,749
Yeah I know Logan.

895
01:05:00,018 --> 01:05:00,785
(Exhales)

896
01:05:01,685 --> 01:05:02,954
I'm fucking her.

897
01:05:03,420 --> 01:05:04,989
(sound of Amber hitting
the ground hard)

898
01:05:05,689 --> 01:05:07,792
You know catcing me was the
entire purpose

899
01:05:07,925 --> 01:05:09,426
of that exercise.

900
01:05:09,559 --> 01:05:10,828
I know.

901
01:05:10,962 --> 01:05:12,162
But you gotta prepare an old
woman before you drop

902
01:05:12,295 --> 01:05:14,164
something big off in her
lap.

903
01:05:14,297 --> 01:05:15,599
You asked.

904
01:05:16,034 --> 01:05:17,367
And you're not old.

905
01:05:20,038 --> 01:05:21,638
Thank you.

906
01:05:27,344 --> 01:05:29,513
This is why you've been
so secretive?

907
01:05:30,380 --> 01:05:32,215
'Cuz I'm sleeping with a woman?

908
01:05:32,784 --> 01:05:35,452
Yeah it's just not something I
ever saw myself doing.

909
01:05:41,391 --> 01:05:42,794
It's just...

910
01:05:44,128 --> 01:05:47,364
Just so much stuff that goes
along with that, you know?

911
01:05:48,365 --> 01:05:51,668
Like now I, now I
suddenly have a label.

912
01:05:53,203 --> 01:05:54,438
Black, white, straight, gay.

913
01:05:54,571 --> 01:05:56,606
There's nothing wrong with
being gay.

914
01:05:57,008 --> 01:05:58,341
I know that.

915
01:05:58,475 --> 01:05:59,509
But you know, a lot of other
people don't.

916
01:05:59,643 --> 01:06:01,611
Girl this is New York.

917
01:06:01,879 --> 01:06:02,914
Yeah

918
01:06:03,047 --> 01:06:04,849
Call my parents, they live
in Brooklyn.

919
01:06:06,017 --> 01:06:07,517
Besides I'm not gay.

920
01:06:07,651 --> 01:06:10,654
I still, I still like men I do.
I'm just... I don't know.

921
01:06:11,923 --> 01:06:13,024
Once upon a time

922
01:06:13,791 --> 01:06:16,259
what feels like a lifetime ago

923
01:06:18,228 --> 01:06:19,730
I was in love

924
01:06:19,864 --> 01:06:21,598
with a white man.

925
01:06:22,800 --> 01:06:24,836
And he loved me.

926
01:06:26,003 --> 01:06:29,040
I wanted to spend my every
waking hour with him

927
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:32,143
To spend my life with him.

928
01:06:32,709 --> 01:06:34,979
But back then where
I was at

929
01:06:35,479 --> 01:06:37,714
it would have taken courage
I didn't have

930
01:06:37,849 --> 01:06:40,218
support from family,
friends, peers

931
01:06:40,350 --> 01:06:42,619
to walk down the street

932
01:06:42,753 --> 01:06:45,923
hand in hand without having
insults hurled at us

933
01:06:50,560 --> 01:06:51,661
So what happened?

934
01:06:53,597 --> 01:06:56,234
I closed my heart to him.

935
01:06:56,733 --> 01:06:59,369
to that entire part of my life.

936
01:07:00,504 --> 01:07:02,672
I don't regret where I'm at,
my family

937
01:07:02,807 --> 01:07:05,609
my choices for any second,
but...

938
01:07:07,078 --> 01:07:09,279
that is one regret

939
01:07:09,412 --> 01:07:11,615
that still hangs over me

940
01:07:12,682 --> 01:07:14,417
and living with regret

941
01:07:16,686 --> 01:07:17,420
is

942
01:07:18,089 --> 01:07:19,891
only my doing.

943
01:07:24,796 --> 01:07:27,965
I feel like when I close my eyes
I keep thinking that

944
01:07:29,733 --> 01:07:32,904
if the world didn't care
I wouldn't care.

945
01:07:39,010 --> 01:07:41,913
If the world didn't care,
I wouldn't care.

946
01:07:44,015 --> 01:07:46,583
Life is a series of choices
Amber.

947
01:07:48,052 --> 01:07:49,753
Every second we choose

948
01:07:49,887 --> 01:07:53,057
our happiness or our
bitter remorse.

949
01:07:53,758 --> 01:07:56,027
And we can only love who
we love

950
01:07:56,160 --> 01:07:58,796
and stand by that choice

951
01:08:00,298 --> 01:08:02,266
Times are changin' baby.

952
01:08:02,566 --> 01:08:04,668
Times are changing.

953
01:08:05,435 --> 01:08:06,336
So...

954
01:08:06,670 --> 01:08:09,673
...step into your life

955
01:08:10,674 --> 01:08:12,709
before it passes you by.

956
01:08:14,879 --> 01:08:16,580
Oww.

957
01:08:20,218 --> 01:08:23,386
(laughter and conversation)

958
01:08:25,056 --> 01:08:27,557
Logan we are just so happy
that Amber

959
01:08:27,691 --> 01:08:29,459
has found a friend like you

960
01:08:29,760 --> 01:08:32,330
during such a difficult time
in her life.

961
01:08:33,064 --> 01:08:35,833
And we really appreciate you
being there for her.

962
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:37,367
It's my absolute pleasure.

963
01:08:37,500 --> 01:08:38,735
She's wonderful.

964
01:08:39,369 --> 01:08:41,305
Nice to finally meet you.

965
01:08:41,705 --> 01:08:43,740
Nice to put a pretty face

966
01:08:43,875 --> 01:08:46,143
to someone we've heard so
much about.

967
01:08:46,676 --> 01:08:48,880
Thank you. Great to meet
you both.

968
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:51,315
I actually have to get going,
I have a client to meet.

969
01:08:51,448 --> 01:08:52,250
I'm sorry.

970
01:08:52,817 --> 01:08:54,952
But please enjoy the rest of
your day

971
01:08:55,619 --> 01:08:57,321
Um I have to go to the
restroom

972
01:08:57,454 --> 01:08:58,756
so I'll just walk you out.

973
01:09:05,897 --> 01:09:06,563
So

974
01:09:09,432 --> 01:09:10,700
you met my parents

975
01:09:11,302 --> 01:09:12,569
I like them.

976
01:09:12,702 --> 01:09:13,938
Well that's because you don't
know them.

977
01:09:14,071 --> 01:09:15,139
(laughs)

978
01:09:15,373 --> 01:09:16,439
No...

979
01:09:17,041 --> 01:09:18,608
I like them

980
01:09:20,177 --> 01:09:21,678
and I love you.

981
01:09:32,123 --> 01:09:33,590
What is this?

982
01:09:35,458 --> 01:09:36,526
(exhales)

983
01:09:36,660 --> 01:09:38,428
It's nothing.

984
01:09:40,064 --> 01:09:41,498
You were leaving?

985
01:09:49,006 --> 01:09:49,606
(exhales hard)

986
01:09:49,739 --> 01:09:51,741
Yup, I'm leaving.

987
01:09:53,643 --> 01:09:54,611
Logan.

988
01:09:58,249 --> 01:09:59,283
Logan hey.

989
01:09:59,516 --> 01:10:00,785
Logan stop.

990
01:10:05,222 --> 01:10:06,757
I'm sorry.

991
01:10:07,925 --> 01:10:09,894
You're always sorry Amber.

992
01:10:11,461 --> 01:10:12,629
(exhales)

993
01:10:12,997 --> 01:10:15,333
Hey look, I didn't expect you to
waltz into the cafe and

994
01:10:15,465 --> 01:10:16,767
just announce your love for me.

995
01:10:17,134 --> 01:10:19,669
But when are you gonna be able
to stand tall next to me?

996
01:10:19,804 --> 01:10:22,039
I told you I just need time.

997
01:10:22,173 --> 01:10:23,774
How much time Amber?

998
01:10:27,744 --> 01:10:30,448
I have never leapt like this
before in my life

999
01:10:30,580 --> 01:10:33,017
and I keep leaping into you

1000
01:10:34,118 --> 01:10:34,785
and I

1001
01:10:34,986 --> 01:10:36,954
keep falling on my fucking face.

1002
01:10:37,088 --> 01:10:38,655
I never asked you to do that.

1003
01:10:38,789 --> 01:10:40,925
You just did it on your own.

1004
01:10:41,392 --> 01:10:42,559
You jumped before I was ready

1005
01:10:42,692 --> 01:10:45,262
I don't know how this is my
fault

1006
01:10:45,963 --> 01:10:46,730
Fault?

1007
01:10:46,864 --> 01:10:48,966
Are you even listening?

1008
01:10:51,435 --> 01:10:52,702
Is everything alright?

1009
01:10:52,837 --> 01:10:54,138
(exhales) Oh god.

1010
01:10:54,271 --> 01:10:55,906
Mom everything is fine.

1011
01:10:58,342 --> 01:10:59,110
Yeah

1012
01:10:59,243 --> 01:11:00,577
everything's fine.

1013
01:11:05,049 --> 01:11:05,548
Fuck.

1014
01:11:05,682 --> 01:11:06,350
Amber.

1015
01:11:06,484 --> 01:11:07,852
Shut up mom.

1016
01:11:10,287 --> 01:11:11,756
What just happened?

1017
01:11:49,726 --> 01:11:52,562
Please don't let me
fuck this up.

1018
01:11:58,135 --> 01:11:59,203
What'd you say?

1019
01:12:02,605 --> 01:12:04,341
I said I love you.

1020
01:12:07,378 --> 01:12:09,080
I love you too.

1021
01:12:20,458 --> 01:12:21,926
(knocks on door)

1022
01:12:32,602 --> 01:12:33,304
Hey.

1023
01:12:33,437 --> 01:12:34,105
Hi.

1024
01:12:35,573 --> 01:12:37,808
Only got a couple of minutes so

1025
01:12:38,909 --> 01:12:40,811
what'd you want to talk
about?

1026
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:43,013
Hi sweetie.

1027
01:12:43,147 --> 01:12:43,613
Hi.

1028
01:12:44,215 --> 01:12:46,317
What are you guys doing here?

1029
01:12:49,086 --> 01:12:52,056
Well Ethan called and uh...

1030
01:12:52,256 --> 01:12:54,825
thought it was best that we sit
down and

1031
01:12:54,959 --> 01:12:57,094
try to figure this thing out.

1032
01:12:58,295 --> 01:12:59,729
What's going on?

1033
01:12:59,864 --> 01:13:01,365
Well we thought it best to
convene.

1034
01:13:01,499 --> 01:13:02,133
Convene?

1035
01:13:02,266 --> 01:13:02,600
Yeah.

1036
01:13:02,732 --> 01:13:03,300
Why?

1037
01:13:03,434 --> 01:13:04,168
So...

1038
01:13:05,735 --> 01:13:07,304
...you and Logan.

1039
01:13:13,477 --> 01:13:14,945
Are you kidding me?

1040
01:13:15,079 --> 01:13:17,348
Okay, honey that's that's not
why we're here.

1041
01:13:17,548 --> 01:13:19,016
Wow.

1042
01:13:19,550 --> 01:13:22,119
They... they didn't say anything

1043
01:13:23,320 --> 01:13:24,221
You did

1044
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:26,689
right now.

1045
01:13:29,960 --> 01:13:31,661
Really Amber?

1046
01:13:32,263 --> 01:13:33,164
What?

1047
01:13:35,533 --> 01:13:37,067
Just explains a lot.

1048
01:13:38,269 --> 01:13:40,703
Okay I am not having this
conversation.

1049
01:13:40,838 --> 01:13:43,174
Okay, hold on. Woah woah
woah hey.

1050
01:13:43,374 --> 01:13:45,276
C'mon, c'mon. Ethan...

1051
01:13:45,708 --> 01:13:46,844
Can we try to focus please?

1052
01:13:46,977 --> 01:13:48,379
Yes, yeah okay.

1053
01:13:49,880 --> 01:13:52,082
I'll... cut to the chase.
Sit down.

1054
01:13:55,718 --> 01:13:56,453
Great.

1055
01:13:56,587 --> 01:13:57,855
Don't sit down.

1056
01:13:58,756 --> 01:13:59,757
(exhales)

1057
01:14:00,424 --> 01:14:03,160
I got a job offer out of state.
I'm leaving in three weeks.

1058
01:14:05,763 --> 01:14:06,729
What?

1059
01:14:09,732 --> 01:14:10,733
You're leaving?

1060
01:14:10,868 --> 01:14:11,835
Yup.

1061
01:14:13,003 --> 01:14:15,272
It's a two year comittment
minimum.

1062
01:14:17,942 --> 01:14:19,210
What about Emily?

1063
01:14:19,476 --> 01:14:21,045
I took the job Amber.

1064
01:14:21,912 --> 01:14:23,746
I'm not asking for your fucking
permission.

1065
01:14:23,881 --> 01:14:24,815
Ethan relax.

1066
01:14:24,949 --> 01:14:26,383
Don't talk to her like that.

1067
01:14:26,517 --> 01:14:27,717
What?

1068
01:14:27,851 --> 01:14:28,686
Can you stay focused on Emily
here?

1069
01:14:28,819 --> 01:14:30,387
Hey, you have no idea

1070
01:14:30,521 --> 01:14:31,255
Enough! Enough!

1071
01:14:31,388 --> 01:14:32,756
Stop it!

1072
01:14:33,257 --> 01:14:34,158
Enough.

1073
01:14:40,864 --> 01:14:42,967
Mom, dad, I...

1074
01:14:44,969 --> 01:14:46,403
Can we just...

1075
01:14:47,371 --> 01:14:48,305
Alright c'mon.

1076
01:14:48,606 --> 01:14:50,040
You're right.

1077
01:14:52,509 --> 01:14:54,878
We'll be in the car honey.

1078
01:14:56,914 --> 01:14:58,349
(door closes)

1079
01:15:04,622 --> 01:15:06,924
I don't know what to say.

1080
01:15:12,696 --> 01:15:14,331
I think that went well.

1081
01:15:25,609 --> 01:15:26,910
(exhales)

1082
01:15:46,130 --> 01:15:48,165
You know I really did love
you Ethan.

1083
01:15:51,770 --> 01:15:53,871
Part of that never goes away.

1084
01:16:01,312 --> 01:16:04,014
I know that you think that I
pushed you away

1085
01:16:04,615 --> 01:16:07,251
a long time ago I - I -
pushed you away but

1086
01:16:07,384 --> 01:16:09,920
You didn't push me away
Amber

1087
01:16:10,354 --> 01:16:11,722
you burned my life to the
ground.

1088
01:16:11,855 --> 01:16:13,824
I know. Mine too.

1089
01:16:14,124 --> 01:16:16,427
And I'm sorry about that.

1090
01:16:21,699 --> 01:16:22,833
I'm...

1091
01:16:28,939 --> 01:16:30,107
(exhales hard)

1092
01:16:36,680 --> 01:16:38,382
It's just that

1093
01:16:45,622 --> 01:16:47,324
I still love you.

1094
01:16:53,130 --> 01:16:55,366
And I don't know how to do this.

1095
01:17:00,938 --> 01:17:03,040
I'm sorry that you're hurting.

1096
01:17:06,643 --> 01:17:07,878
Look, I - I know

1097
01:17:08,245 --> 01:17:10,247
I was an asshole to you

1098
01:17:10,547 --> 01:17:11,582
a lot.

1099
01:17:15,018 --> 01:17:16,353
I regret that.

1100
01:17:16,754 --> 01:17:18,655
No - look at me.

1101
01:17:18,790 --> 01:17:19,656
Amber.

1102
01:17:25,963 --> 01:17:27,064
Tell me what to do.

1103
01:17:27,197 --> 01:17:28,265
(crying whimper)

1104
01:17:29,233 --> 01:17:30,701
You tell me what to do

1105
01:17:30,835 --> 01:17:32,503
and I'll do it.

1106
01:17:41,612 --> 01:17:43,213
I was a kid Ethan.

1107
01:17:47,151 --> 01:17:49,920
We were just kids. I - I -
I - I... (exhales)

1108
01:17:50,254 --> 01:17:52,623
You need to be able to see that-
I mean -

1109
01:17:55,926 --> 01:17:57,227
Can you see that?

1110
01:17:58,830 --> 01:17:59,596
Yeah.

1111
01:18:05,870 --> 01:18:09,239
I didn't like the person I was
becoming around you.

1112
01:18:10,775 --> 01:18:12,209
I hated her

1113
01:18:12,342 --> 01:18:15,145
and I don't want to be her
anymore.

1114
01:18:22,019 --> 01:18:24,221
I think that we both failed us

1115
01:18:27,759 --> 01:18:29,159
and Emily.

1116
01:18:35,365 --> 01:18:38,202
But Emily can't live without you

1117
01:18:43,407 --> 01:18:45,609
You're an amazing mother.

1118
01:18:48,813 --> 01:18:49,646
Yeah

1119
01:18:50,280 --> 01:18:51,816
but you're her father.

1120
01:18:52,416 --> 01:18:55,285
And she's gonna miss you
so much.

1121
01:18:56,153 --> 01:18:58,055
Why do you have to...

1122
01:19:02,993 --> 01:19:06,163
(Ethan cries softly)

1123
01:19:12,904 --> 01:19:14,004
I have to.

1124
01:19:26,183 --> 01:19:28,051
He's leaving in three weeks.

1125
01:19:28,987 --> 01:19:31,221
Wow. Just like that.

1126
01:19:32,757 --> 01:19:33,457
Yup.

1127
01:19:38,428 --> 01:19:40,597
It's just a lot of changes
coming my way.

1128
01:19:44,969 --> 01:19:46,270
I can help

1129
01:19:46,804 --> 01:19:47,704
with Emily.

1130
01:19:47,839 --> 01:19:49,206
I can help you.

1131
01:19:49,339 --> 01:19:51,141
But I gotta figure out
everything with work and -

1132
01:19:51,843 --> 01:19:53,243
just everything is going
to be really different.

1133
01:19:53,377 --> 01:19:55,145
Amber... Amber...

1134
01:19:55,279 --> 01:19:57,447
I don't think that you're
listening to me.

1135
01:19:57,714 --> 01:19:58,749
Hey

1136
01:20:00,852 --> 01:20:04,022
I'm saying that I want to
be a part of your life

1137
01:20:04,688 --> 01:20:06,858
and Emily's life in a
bigger way.

1138
01:20:06,991 --> 01:20:08,725
I know and that's very
sweet

1139
01:20:09,027 --> 01:20:09,961
but...

1140
01:20:10,093 --> 01:20:11,595
you're leaving for tour and

1141
01:20:11,728 --> 01:20:14,032
Not forever. I'm here we can
figure it...

1142
01:20:14,164 --> 01:20:17,534
I know but it doesn't matter
because it's not the right time.

1143
01:20:22,907 --> 01:20:26,076
(exhales hard)

1144
01:20:33,150 --> 01:20:35,552
You're awfully quiet tonight.

1145
01:20:37,055 --> 01:20:38,689
(exhales)

1146
01:20:38,823 --> 01:20:40,257
Yeah I guess.

1147
01:20:42,626 --> 01:20:44,929
Anything you wanna talk about?

1148
01:20:45,964 --> 01:20:48,365
There's just a lot going on
right now.

1149
01:20:49,466 --> 01:20:52,102
You know? With you taking
Emily on and

1150
01:20:53,170 --> 01:20:55,739
a lot of (exhales)
a lot of things.

1151
01:20:56,306 --> 01:20:57,174
Yeah.

1152
01:20:57,741 --> 01:20:59,811
I know it's gonna be a lot
with work but

1153
01:20:59,944 --> 01:21:01,278
I'm actually really excited.

1154
01:21:01,411 --> 01:21:03,180
I miss her so much.

1155
01:21:05,582 --> 01:21:06,583
Hey.

1156
01:21:08,752 --> 01:21:10,187
What's going on?

1157
01:21:18,029 --> 01:21:19,764
I think we need to talk.

1158
01:21:21,164 --> 01:21:22,599
Okay.

1159
01:21:26,771 --> 01:21:29,740
The owners of the apartment I'm
taking care of

1160
01:21:29,874 --> 01:21:31,042
are coming back early.

1161
01:21:31,174 --> 01:21:32,409
And uh...

1162
01:21:32,944 --> 01:21:35,913
You know I'm going on tour
for a few months

1163
01:21:36,814 --> 01:21:38,116
And I'm not sure

1164
01:21:38,348 --> 01:21:41,485
where my home base is gonna be
when I come back to New York.

1165
01:21:43,087 --> 01:21:44,856
Okay.

1166
01:21:46,189 --> 01:21:48,158
Is... that's all?

1167
01:21:50,360 --> 01:21:52,195
I ju... (exhales)

1168
01:21:55,198 --> 01:21:56,533
What?

1169
01:21:59,103 --> 01:22:01,238
I think we need to break up.

1170
01:22:02,673 --> 01:22:03,740
What?

1171
01:22:06,978 --> 01:22:08,412
I'm sorry.

1172
01:22:10,380 --> 01:22:12,817
I just don't think this
is working.

1173
01:22:14,052 --> 01:22:15,019
(exhales hard)

1174
01:22:15,153 --> 01:22:16,420
What?

1175
01:22:18,221 --> 01:22:19,891
We just can' keep doing this.

1176
01:22:21,893 --> 01:22:23,593
What? I...

1177
01:22:25,195 --> 01:22:27,065
I don't understand.

1178
01:22:28,066 --> 01:22:31,435
Look okay I know that I said
that this isn't the right time

1179
01:22:32,602 --> 01:22:34,939
but I think maybe once

1180
01:22:35,338 --> 01:22:38,076
Emily settles in a little,
you know

1181
01:22:38,275 --> 01:22:39,342
you can, you can

1182
01:22:39,476 --> 01:22:40,812
move in with us.

1183
01:22:40,945 --> 01:22:41,846
With me.

1184
01:22:42,113 --> 01:22:43,346
Move in?

1185
01:22:43,480 --> 01:22:45,716
Yes, I think that I'm ready
for that.

1186
01:22:46,750 --> 01:22:48,318
I'm...

1187
01:22:48,719 --> 01:22:50,387
I mean it Logan I am
ready for that.

1188
01:22:50,520 --> 01:22:51,956
That's what I...

1189
01:22:53,891 --> 01:22:57,061
You know if this is about
my parents, you know I don't-

1190
01:22:57,594 --> 01:22:59,396
I don't care what they think.

1191
01:23:01,866 --> 01:23:03,400
Emily loves you.

1192
01:23:04,902 --> 01:23:06,636
She loves you.

1193
01:23:08,405 --> 01:23:09,740
I love you.

1194
01:23:14,411 --> 01:23:16,713
I love you.

1195
01:23:17,347 --> 01:23:19,817
I know that I keep letting
you down

1196
01:23:20,417 --> 01:23:21,651
but

1197
01:23:21,786 --> 01:23:23,955
I never loved anybody like
I love you.

1198
01:23:25,355 --> 01:23:27,624
So why are you doing this?

1199
01:23:28,192 --> 01:23:29,593
Because Amber

1200
01:23:32,295 --> 01:23:33,530
I can't

1201
01:23:33,663 --> 01:23:36,200
love you from such a
vulnerable place.

1202
01:23:37,101 --> 01:23:39,971
You say yes to me and my life
is amazing

1203
01:23:40,370 --> 01:23:42,339
you say no and I'm
crushed and

1204
01:23:42,807 --> 01:23:44,008
I can't

1205
01:23:44,274 --> 01:23:46,576
love you from this place.

1206
01:23:50,248 --> 01:23:51,249
I...

1207
01:23:51,381 --> 01:23:53,383
I really...
I really...

1208
01:23:55,920 --> 01:23:57,287
I need you okay?

1209
01:23:57,420 --> 01:23:58,688
I need you.

1210
01:23:58,823 --> 01:24:01,525
I don't, I don't want to do this
alone. I don't.

1211
01:24:02,526 --> 01:24:04,162
You have all these things

1212
01:24:04,494 --> 01:24:05,930
that you wanna do

1213
01:24:06,998 --> 01:24:07,999
you know?

1214
01:24:09,599 --> 01:24:11,936
And there's so much you
have to focus on

1215
01:24:12,469 --> 01:24:13,938
and it's not me.

1216
01:24:16,808 --> 01:24:18,075
You gotta figure out what
you want.

01:24:18,209 --> 01:24:20,343
I know what I want.
I know what I want.

1218

I want you.

1219
01:24:23,214 --> 01:24:24,481
I want you.

1220
01:24:30,687 --> 01:24:32,890
Please don't do this.

1221
01:24:33,991 --> 01:24:35,592
Don't do this okay?

1274
01:29:19,810 --> 01:29:22,346
I don't think that lifestyle
suits you

1275
01:29:22,480 --> 01:29:23,646
or Emily.

1276
01:29:23,881 --> 01:29:25,483
It's for the best.

1277
01:29:25,883 --> 01:29:28,185
You don't think it suits
me mom?

1278
01:29:29,220 --> 01:29:31,355
It's not a dress that
we're talking about.

1279
01:29:31,822 --> 01:29:33,357
You asked my opinion.

1280
01:29:33,491 --> 01:29:35,459
No, I didn't mom.

1281
01:29:36,127 --> 01:29:37,928
You asked me how I was
doing

1282
01:29:38,728 --> 01:29:39,763
and I can't hide this

1283
01:29:39,897 --> 01:29:41,664
I'm sorry, I'm a mess.

1284
01:29:41,799 --> 01:29:44,969
Exactly why you need to
turn the page.

1285
01:29:46,237 --> 01:29:49,706
Nothing good can ever come
of this darling.

1286
01:29:52,143 --> 01:29:53,210
Why not.

1287
01:29:54,011 --> 01:29:56,914
Because it's not who
we are Amber.

1288
01:29:59,817 --> 01:30:02,386
I'm your daughter mom,
I'm not you.

1289
01:30:02,586 --> 01:30:04,355
Of course not but you're...

1290
01:30:04,488 --> 01:30:05,990
But what?

1291
01:30:07,191 --> 01:30:08,259
I love her.

1292
01:30:08,392 --> 01:30:10,094
Emily loves her.

1293
01:30:10,594 --> 01:30:12,263
And she left you.

1294
01:30:12,963 --> 01:30:14,731
It's for the best.

1295
01:30:15,933 --> 01:30:19,103
Yeah maybe it is for you mom
but it's not for me.

1296
01:30:21,438 --> 01:30:22,973
She made me happy.

1297
01:30:25,009 --> 01:30:27,744
She made me feel alive

1298
01:30:28,412 --> 01:30:30,347
for the first time.

1299
01:30:32,049 --> 01:30:35,219
And she loves me I know
she still loves me.

1300
01:30:37,855 --> 01:30:39,990
It's not love.

1301
01:30:42,893 --> 01:30:44,295
It'll pass.

1302
01:30:44,428 --> 01:30:46,330
It'll pass. It'll pass?

1303

your shame

get to be a part of this.

You don't get to be a part

Not in the same way as
you but -

1322
01:31:32,376 --> 01:31:34,912
Mostly because it's not easy
for Amber.

1323

I mean, I can see that.

1324

She could just wait to meet
the right man.

1325
01:31:41,452 --> 01:31:42,186
She was

1326
01:31:42,653 --> 01:31:45,322
happy. I mean, had you stopped
to notice that?

01:31:45,556 --> 01:31:46,523

(radio) Love

1514

you know, the kind of love
you dream about when

you're a kid. When you're
growing up and learning

1516
01:40:28,445 --> 01:40:29,513
about everything

1517
01:40:29,713 --> 01:40:31,849
and then you get older and

1518
01:40:32,449 --> 01:40:34,317
you stop believing in it

1519
01:40:36,020 --> 01:40:37,054
But... uh...

1520
01:40:39,456 --> 01:40:41,358

Umm...

1527
01:40:56,606 --> 01:40:58,876
Well when I first wrote the song

1528
01:40:59,010 --> 01:41:00,978
it was kind of like

1529
01:41:02,246 --> 01:41:03,713
I wrote it

1530
01:41:03,848 --> 01:41:05,917
for someone I hadn't even
met yet.

1531
01:41:08,252 --> 01:41:09,386
But umm...

1532
01:41:10,154 --> 01:41:13,791
when I played it for an
audience for the first time

1533
01:41:16,459 --> 01:41:18,361
a friend of mine was in the room

1534
01:41:20,164 --> 01:41:21,866

1535
01:41:22,666 --> 01:41:24,902

01:41:26,237 --> 01:41:27,305
somehow

1537
