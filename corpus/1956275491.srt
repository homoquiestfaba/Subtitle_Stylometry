1
00:00:36,492 --> 00:00:39,392
Man: [Whistles] Listen up!

2
00:00:39,394 --> 00:00:43,195
Kevin, you are playing
the number 5 position.

3
00:00:43,197 --> 00:00:44,763
It means you set the back pick

4
00:00:44,765 --> 00:00:48,166
on the box
on the weak side for tom!

5
00:00:48,168 --> 00:00:51,269
Carrie, you're going
to catch the ball
at the foul line,

6
00:00:51,271 --> 00:00:53,037
and then you're going to pivot.

7
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:55,105
You're going to pivot into
the triple-threat position,

8
00:00:55,107 --> 00:00:58,274
bounce pass it to tom
at the top of the key.

9
00:00:58,276 --> 00:01:01,076
Then you go back door, OK?

10
00:01:01,078 --> 00:01:02,343
You are going to go back door

11
00:01:02,345 --> 00:01:05,312
towards the basket
for the lay-up.

12
00:01:05,314 --> 00:01:07,547
Are their any questions?

13
00:01:09,217 --> 00:01:11,651
What?

14
00:01:11,652 --> 00:01:14,086
All: Can we go on
the trampoline, Mr. O'Hara?

15
00:01:14,088 --> 00:01:16,088
Yeah.

16
00:01:17,224 --> 00:01:19,390
No flips on the trampoline.

17
00:01:19,392 --> 00:01:21,291
You have your friend
Billy Williams
to thank for that.

18
00:01:21,293 --> 00:01:25,094
He had to sue the school
after hurting his neck,

19
00:01:25,096 --> 00:01:26,595
ruining it for everyone.

20
00:01:26,597 --> 00:01:28,563
What?

21
00:01:28,565 --> 00:01:31,332
Are you all right,
Mr. O'Hara?

22
00:01:31,334 --> 00:01:33,284
You look worried.

23
00:01:33,285 --> 00:01:35,235
[Chuckles] Well, Josh,
I am a little worried.

24
00:01:35,237 --> 00:01:38,438
My celtics are
playing a very important
basketball game tonight.

25
00:01:38,440 --> 00:01:41,340
I really want them to win.

26
00:01:41,342 --> 00:01:44,076
It's like you say,
the most important thing

27
00:01:44,078 --> 00:01:47,112
is that they
try their hardest
and they have fun.

28
00:01:49,783 --> 00:01:50,782
No.

29
00:01:50,784 --> 00:01:52,083
No.

30
00:01:52,085 --> 00:01:54,118
The most important thing...

31
00:01:54,120 --> 00:01:56,386
Is that they win.

32
00:01:56,388 --> 00:02:00,456
I mean, we're not talking
about, uh, kickball here,

33
00:02:00,458 --> 00:02:02,591
where there's absolutely
nothing at stake.

34
00:02:02,593 --> 00:02:07,528
We're talking
about the national
basketball association.

35
00:02:07,530 --> 00:02:09,763
They have to win.

36
00:02:09,765 --> 00:02:12,766
You understand?

37
00:02:12,767 --> 00:02:15,768
They're tearing down
the Boston garden
at the end of this season,

38
00:02:15,771 --> 00:02:19,472
so this is their
last chance at glory.

39
00:02:19,474 --> 00:02:22,274
They will not lose,

40
00:02:22,276 --> 00:02:24,309
because I won't let them lose!

41
00:02:24,311 --> 00:02:26,444
Do you understand?
[Sniffle]

42
00:02:26,446 --> 00:02:27,611
[Sniffle]

43
00:02:29,214 --> 00:02:31,180
Don't cry.

44
00:02:31,182 --> 00:02:34,283
Don't... don't cry. I was...

45
00:02:35,252 --> 00:02:37,269
I was just being silly.

46
00:02:37,270 --> 00:02:39,287
[Chuckles] Why don't you go
jump on the trampoline, OK?

47
00:02:39,289 --> 00:02:40,888
You'll feel better.

48
00:02:40,890 --> 00:02:42,489
Go on. You don't even
have to stand in line.

49
00:02:42,491 --> 00:02:47,126
Hey! Hey!
Josh doesn't have
to stand in line, everybody.

50
00:02:51,132 --> 00:02:52,331
Hi, Mike.

51
00:02:52,333 --> 00:02:54,199
Hey, Carol.

52
00:02:54,201 --> 00:02:55,600
Hey. What's up?

53
00:02:56,569 --> 00:02:58,535
Got a minute?
Yeah.

54
00:02:58,537 --> 00:03:01,838
Look, I'm sorry I've been
acting like such a jerk, OK?

55
00:03:01,840 --> 00:03:04,507
We are right in the middle
of the nba finals,

56
00:03:04,509 --> 00:03:07,142
and you know that I tend
to get a little bit crazy...

57
00:03:07,144 --> 00:03:08,376
I know,

58
00:03:08,378 --> 00:03:11,312
but I've been hearing
that for 15 years.

59
00:03:11,314 --> 00:03:14,481
In the mid-eighties,
when the celtics
won the championship,

60
00:03:14,483 --> 00:03:15,849
you were a joy to be with.

61
00:03:15,851 --> 00:03:16,850
Right.

62
00:03:16,852 --> 00:03:18,384
But I can't stand

63
00:03:18,386 --> 00:03:20,619
seeing you in a good
mood when they win

64
00:03:20,621 --> 00:03:23,355
and a bad mood when they lose.

65
00:03:23,357 --> 00:03:25,857
I won't let
the celtics run my life.

66
00:03:25,859 --> 00:03:27,291
Well, how do you think I feel?

67
00:03:27,293 --> 00:03:29,526
Mike!

68
00:03:30,495 --> 00:03:33,362
These are divorce papers.

69
00:03:33,364 --> 00:03:37,332
I still have them
from the last time
we split up.

70
00:03:37,334 --> 00:03:38,333
You saved them?

71
00:03:38,335 --> 00:03:40,168
Yes.

72
00:03:40,170 --> 00:03:43,171
And the only reason
I haven't signed them

73
00:03:43,173 --> 00:03:46,440
is because I feel bad for you.

74
00:03:46,442 --> 00:03:48,942
I spoke with my
therapist about this,

75
00:03:48,944 --> 00:03:51,211
and I know that
part of this obsession

76
00:03:51,212 --> 00:03:53,479
comes from the fact
that you never made it
as a basketball player.

77
00:03:53,481 --> 00:03:54,880
Your dream died,

78
00:03:54,882 --> 00:03:57,482
and now you're living
through the celtics.

79
00:03:57,484 --> 00:03:59,484
It is time to move on.

80
00:03:59,486 --> 00:04:01,486
It's time to get a new dream.

81
00:04:01,488 --> 00:04:02,487
My dream is dead.

82
00:04:02,489 --> 00:04:04,973
Mike...

83
00:04:04,974 --> 00:04:07,458
Squashed like a squirrel
on the side of the highway.

84
00:04:07,460 --> 00:04:09,259
Thank you for
the update, honey.

85
00:04:09,261 --> 00:04:11,427
Screw you.

86
00:04:11,429 --> 00:04:13,762
I'm just trying to be nice,

87
00:04:13,764 --> 00:04:14,796
but you are hopeless.

88
00:04:14,798 --> 00:04:16,364
Well, I know I'm hopeless,

89
00:04:16,366 --> 00:04:18,866
because my dream is dead!

90
00:04:18,868 --> 00:04:20,534
Hey, kids!

91
00:04:20,536 --> 00:04:22,235
[Whistles] Listen up!

92
00:04:22,237 --> 00:04:25,972
My dream is dead! OK?

93
00:04:25,974 --> 00:04:26,973
You are sick.

94
00:04:26,975 --> 00:04:28,474
Oh yeah, I know I'm sick.

95
00:04:28,476 --> 00:04:30,275
I am sick and tired

96
00:04:30,277 --> 00:04:31,776

97
00:04:31,778 --> 00:04:35,880

and twisting it around!

98
00:04:35,882 --> 00:04:39,216
I love the celtics!

99
00:04:39,218 --> 00:04:40,784
OK?! I said it!

100
00:04:40,786 --> 00:04:43,486
I am not ashamed of it!

101
00:04:43,488 --> 00:04:49,891
I love the celtics!

102

Bounce.

103

[School bell rings]

104
00:05:12,946 --> 00:05:14,612
I am not a hero.

105
00:05:16,616 --> 00:05:19,316
A hero fights
against injustice.

106
00:05:20,819 --> 00:05:23,519
A hero sacrifices
for the good of man.

107
00:05:24,922 --> 00:05:27,856
He unites, uplifts,

108
00:05:27,858 --> 00:05:29,991
and inspires.

109
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,393
I'm not a hero.

110
00:05:34,362 --> 00:05:35,828
It's my house.

111
00:05:35,830 --> 00:05:36,374
Aaahhhh!

112
00:05:46,940 --> 00:05:48,306
Aaahhh!

113

Aaahhh!

114
00:05:53,946 --> 00:05:57,447
I don't want
to raise your kids.

115
00:05:57,449 --> 00:05:59,415
I don't even like kids.

116
00:06:00,885 --> 00:06:02,351
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

there, you douche bag.

to give you the beating
of your life tomorrow night.

All right, just one in the net.

121

One in the net,
that's all I'm asking.

Let them do what they do.

like, 5 more minutes?

Because I know neely's
going to pull it out.

all out of whack.

00:08:34,201 --> 00:08:35,266
Mm-hmm.
[Laughs]

184
00:08:35,268 --> 00:08:36,567
Good evening, sir.

185
00:08:36,569 --> 00:08:38,235
Ma'am.

186
00:08:38,237 --> 00:08:40,270
Kevin.
Shouldn't you be...

187
00:08:40,272 --> 00:08:43,072
Planting evidence
on somebody just about
this time of night?

188
00:08:43,074 --> 00:08:45,974
[Groans] I already did that.

189
00:08:45,976 --> 00:08:48,276
The celtics are
going to blow out
Utah tomorrow.

190
00:08:48,278 --> 00:08:50,228
I hope so.

191
00:08:50,229 --> 00:08:52,179
Scott's been taking
about 50 shots a game.

192
00:08:52,181 --> 00:08:53,947
If he gets hot,
we are in trouble.

193
00:08:53,949 --> 00:08:56,182
Oh, if he gets hot,
we're in trouble.

194
00:08:56,184 --> 00:08:57,983
I mean, big guy thinks that

195
00:08:57,985 --> 00:08:59,617
3 weeks of college ball,
and he's an expert.

196
00:08:59,619 --> 00:09:01,285
Uh, wait a minute now.
Let me remind you

197
00:09:01,287 --> 00:09:03,020
that this gentleman
led the city of Boston

198
00:09:03,022 --> 00:09:05,589
in rebounds and assists
in his senior year
of high school.

199
00:09:05,591 --> 00:09:06,857
While you, on the other hand,

200
00:09:06,858 --> 00:09:08,124
were brutally defeated
in the first round

201
00:09:08,126 --> 00:09:10,159
of the 1973 state
wrestling tournament

202
00:09:10,161 --> 00:09:11,960
by a blind guy from Cambridge.

203
00:09:11,962 --> 00:09:13,929
I wouldn't say brutally.

204
00:09:13,930 --> 00:09:15,897
Besides, I held back.
I didn't want to hurt
the poor kid.

205
00:09:15,899 --> 00:09:17,565
He pinned you
in 8.2 seconds.

206
00:09:17,567 --> 00:09:20,000
I mean, where do you store
all this... this memory?

207
00:09:20,002 --> 00:09:22,969
I... I mean,
how... how do you...

208
00:09:22,971 --> 00:09:25,137
I mean, it's more like
12 seconds anyway.

209
00:09:25,139 --> 00:09:26,705
Hey, mark...

210
00:09:26,707 --> 00:09:27,972
Turn on the tube
here, will you?

211
00:09:27,974 --> 00:09:29,239
Help me out.

212
00:09:30,175 --> 00:09:31,307
TV: On Tuesday night...

213
00:09:31,309 --> 00:09:33,726
here we go.

214
00:09:33,727 --> 00:09:36,144
As the celtics defeated
the Utah jazz 106 to 94.

215
00:09:36,147 --> 00:09:37,546
To make matters worse,

216
00:09:37,548 --> 00:09:39,648
Scott was fined $10,000...

217
00:09:39,650 --> 00:09:41,716
10,000 bucks?

218
00:09:41,718 --> 00:09:43,084
10 gs. Jeez,
what's that to him?

219
00:09:43,086 --> 00:09:44,952
The guy's got
money he ain't even
looked at yet.

220
00:09:44,954 --> 00:09:47,120
TV: Had this to say
about Tuesday's game.

221
00:09:47,122 --> 00:09:50,590
Scott: I'm sorry.
OK? I'm sorry.

222
00:09:50,592 --> 00:09:53,076
I guess I've been
having back problems

223
00:09:53,077 --> 00:09:55,561
from carrying this
sorry excuse for a team
all season long.

224
00:09:55,563 --> 00:09:58,564
Oh, Jesus. Talk about
your textbook a-hole.

225
00:09:58,566 --> 00:10:00,165
Oh, man. Blaming
the team, right?

226
00:10:00,167 --> 00:10:02,133
TV: Lewis Scott
has gone awol.

227
00:10:02,135 --> 00:10:05,903
Suddenly, Dennis rodman
doesn't seem so bad.

228
00:10:05,905 --> 00:10:07,304
Jimmy: Here we go, celtics!

229
00:10:07,306 --> 00:10:08,305
Crowd: Here we go!

230
00:10:08,307 --> 00:10:09,306
Here we go, celtics!

231
00:10:09,308 --> 00:10:10,340
Here we go!

232
00:10:10,342 --> 00:10:12,575
Here we go, celtics!

233
00:10:14,879 --> 00:10:16,912
Hey, ed!
Ed!

234
00:10:21,084 --> 00:10:22,083

235
00:10:22,085 --> 00:10:24,035
Hey!

236
00:10:24,036 --> 00:10:25,986
Crowd: Here we go, celtics!
Here we go!

237
00:10:44,104 --> 00:10:45,369
Here we go.

238
00:10:45,371 --> 00:10:46,370
Hey, tom! Tim!

Here we go!
Here we go!

240
00:10:49,108 --> 00:10:50,373
How are you doing,
Mr. Tanner?

241
00:10:50,375 --> 00:10:52,141
Spent the entire morning
on the bowl.

242
00:10:52,143 --> 00:10:54,376
Oh! That's always
a good sign.

243
00:10:54,378 --> 00:10:56,111
Hey!

244
00:10:57,681 --> 00:10:59,113
Just the way
you like it, Jimmy.

245
00:11:00,382 --> 00:11:02,382
I even toasted the bun.

246
00:11:02,384 --> 00:11:05,084
Well, how'd you do that?
There's no toaster here.

247
00:11:05,086 --> 00:11:06,952
I used my curling iron.

248
00:11:06,954 --> 00:11:08,053
Oh, thanks, Suzy.

249
00:11:08,055 --> 00:11:10,955
It's on the house, Jimmy.

250
00:11:12,058 --> 00:11:13,957
Oh, it's on the house, Jimmy!

251
00:11:13,959 --> 00:11:15,992
Suzy, the hot-dog
girl!

252
00:11:15,994 --> 00:11:18,060
Hey! Beer!

253
00:11:18,062 --> 00:11:19,227

[Crowd boos]

255
00:11:21,965 --> 00:11:22,964
Shall we begin?

256
00:11:22,966 --> 00:11:24,265
Indeed, sir.

257
00:11:24,267 --> 00:11:25,699
Boo!

258
00:11:25,701 --> 00:11:27,967
Go home, jazz!

259
00:11:27,969 --> 00:11:29,668
It's over!

260
00:11:29,670 --> 00:11:32,070
Jazz music sucks

261
00:11:32,072 --> 00:11:33,638
and so do you!

262
00:11:33,640 --> 00:11:34,639
You suck.

263
00:11:34,641 --> 00:11:36,240
Why don't you go back to Utah

264
00:11:36,242 --> 00:11:38,909
and get yourself
a few more wives?!

265
00:11:38,911 --> 00:11:40,143
Hey,

let's you take a shot,

267
00:11:42,714 --> 00:11:44,980
you'd probably wet
your frigging pants!

268
00:11:44,982 --> 00:11:49,351
Hey! Why don't you
go join the mormon
tabernacle choir,

269
00:11:49,353 --> 00:11:51,686

loving freaks?!

270
00:11:53,089 --> 00:11:55,689
You are in beantown now, baby!

Beantown.

Beantown!

273
00:11:58,927 --> 00:12:00,326
I hate fans.

274
00:12:00,328 --> 00:12:02,695
Hey, Scott!

275
00:12:02,697 --> 00:12:05,097
I hear manute bol

276
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:06,164
Manute bol...

277
00:12:06,166 --> 00:12:07,331
Your mom.

278
00:12:07,333 --> 00:12:09,966
Oh, that's witty, whitey.

279
00:12:09,968 --> 00:12:12,935
You guys suck so bad

280
00:12:12,937 --> 00:12:15,003

take your shoes away!

[Laughs]

282
00:12:16,973 --> 00:12:18,205
How'd I do?

283
00:12:18,207 --> 00:12:19,372
Good with the shoes.

284
00:12:19,374 --> 00:12:21,907
Yeah, I thought of
that one last night.

285
00:12:23,310 --> 00:12:25,376
Wait a minute.
This is an even game, isn't it?

286
00:12:25,378 --> 00:12:27,711
It's an even game. God.

287
00:12:27,713 --> 00:12:29,979
Even game.

288
00:12:29,981 --> 00:12:31,680
Ohh, that was close.

289
00:12:31,682 --> 00:12:33,048
Whew.

All right.
Here we go.

291
00:12:37,053 --> 00:12:38,569
Good evening, everyone.

292
00:12:38,570 --> 00:12:40,086

the final game here

297
00:12:48,363 --> 00:12:50,262
on the parquet
at the Boston garden

298
00:12:50,264 --> 00:12:53,265
before it is torn down.

299
00:12:53,267 --> 00:12:55,100
All right, gentlemen. Ha.

300
00:12:55,102 --> 00:12:57,219
This is it.

301
00:12:57,220 --> 00:12:59,337
Let's just play the game
that got us here, all right?

302
00:12:59,339 --> 00:13:01,339
We're going to pass
that ball around.
Keep it moving.

303
00:13:01,341 --> 00:13:02,973
We're going to bang the boards.

304
00:13:02,975 --> 00:13:05,342
We're going to grab
some big fat defense.

305
00:13:05,344 --> 00:13:06,876
That's all we need to do.

306
00:13:06,878 --> 00:13:07,877
Oh, one other thing.

307
00:13:07,879 --> 00:13:08,944

Why don't you shut up?!

318
00:13:30,095 --> 00:13:31,994
Why don't you learn to coach?!

00:13:31,996 --> 00:13:33,362
Come on, buddy!

Hey, Lewis, why don't
you try passing the ball?

Man, worry about
your own game, bitch.

00:23:49,423 --> 00:23:51,173
Like, you know,
completely wrecked

542
00:23:51,174 --> 00:23:52,924
so he was
too hungover to play
well on Sunday?

543
00:23:52,926 --> 00:23:54,425
We could do that.

544
00:23:54,427 --> 00:23:55,993
And nobody
could do it
better than us.

545
00:23:55,995 --> 00:23:57,494
He'd be wasted for a week.

546
00:23:57,496 --> 00:23:58,962
[Laughs]

547
00:23:58,964 --> 00:24:01,464
So let's do it.

548
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,333
Are you serious?

549
00:24:04,335 --> 00:24:05,801
You really want to do it?

550
00:24:05,803 --> 00:24:07,936
'Cause I... I will do it.

551
00:24:11,508 --> 00:24:13,841
Let's mess him up.

552
00:24:16,545 --> 00:24:18,045
Jimmy: I'm one of
his biggest fans.

553
00:24:18,047 --> 00:24:19,446
These guys love to hear that.

554
00:24:19,448 --> 00:24:20,580
Hey! Lewis Scott!

555
00:24:20,582 --> 00:24:23,115
I'm your biggest fan.
How are you?

556
00:24:23,117 --> 00:24:24,516
Hey, don't I know you
from somewhere?

557
00:24:24,518 --> 00:24:26,034
I s-saw you at
the game tonight.

558
00:24:26,035 --> 00:24:27,551
Oh, you played
a hell of a game.
Shot the light's out.

559
00:24:27,554 --> 00:24:30,154
[Laughs] Yeah, I guess I did.

560
00:24:30,156 --> 00:24:32,089
Yo, you're the dude
off the dance floor...

561
00:24:32,091 --> 00:24:33,590
hey, Scott!

562
00:24:33,592 --> 00:24:35,058
You son of a bitch!

563
00:24:35,060 --> 00:24:39,595
The celtics are
going to hand you
your ass on Sunday!

564
00:24:39,597 --> 00:24:42,998
Your whole
team hates you
and so do I!

565
00:24:43,000 --> 00:24:45,233
Really? Well,
look at this here.

566
00:24:45,235 --> 00:24:48,502
She loves me.
So does my banker.

567
00:24:48,504 --> 00:24:49,970
So why don't you go
somewhere and vomit

568
00:24:49,972 --> 00:24:51,638
so you can feel
better about yourself.

569
00:24:51,640 --> 00:24:54,173
You're nothing but
a selfish ball hog...

570
00:24:54,175 --> 00:24:55,240
hey, moron!

571
00:24:55,242 --> 00:24:56,674
Hey! The reason...

572
00:24:56,676 --> 00:24:59,910
Why he is a selfish ball hog...

573
00:24:59,912 --> 00:25:01,945
Is because...

574
00:25:03,548 --> 00:25:06,949
He is the greatest
player in the nba.

575
00:25:06,951 --> 00:25:08,551
Get out of here.

576
00:25:08,552 --> 00:25:10,152
I am going to beat your ass
if you don't get out of here,

577
00:25:10,154 --> 00:25:11,854
just the way that...

578
00:25:11,855 --> 00:25:13,555
Utah's going to beat
the celtics. Ha ha.

579
00:25:13,557 --> 00:25:14,689
Hey, where are you from?!

580
00:25:14,691 --> 00:25:16,090
I'm from charlestown.
Get out of here!

581
00:25:16,092 --> 00:25:17,091
What's the matter with you?!

582
00:25:17,093 --> 00:25:18,559
Are you a traitor, huh?!

583
00:25:18,561 --> 00:25:19,960
That son of a...

584
00:25:19,962 --> 00:25:21,661
Hey, my man.
I think I'm going to throw up.

585
00:25:21,663 --> 00:25:23,379
I appreciate that, man.

586
00:25:23,380 --> 00:25:25,096
It takes a lot of courage
to speak the truth in this town.

587
00:25:25,099 --> 00:25:26,632
Ah.

588
00:25:26,633 --> 00:25:28,166
He wouldn't have
said anything if
he didn't mean it.

589
00:25:28,168 --> 00:25:29,267
That's right.

590
00:25:29,269 --> 00:25:31,169
You're the greatest.
Oh-ho!

591
00:25:31,170 --> 00:25:33,070
Well, you guys are
obviously well-educated fans.

592
00:25:33,072 --> 00:25:35,505
Well, we want
to buy you a drink.

593
00:25:35,507 --> 00:25:37,240
No, no, no, no.

594
00:25:37,241 --> 00:25:38,974
Lewis Scott is going
to buy you two a drink.

595
00:25:38,977 --> 00:25:40,576
All right!
Is Lewis Scott here?

596
00:25:40,578 --> 00:25:42,177
I'll have another beer,

597
00:25:42,179 --> 00:25:44,045
and my new friends here
is going to have...

598
00:25:44,047 --> 00:25:45,546
a scotch soda.
Schnapps.

599
00:25:45,548 --> 00:25:48,682
Schnapps and scotch
and make mine a vodka.

600
00:25:48,684 --> 00:25:50,050
All right.

601
00:25:51,086 --> 00:25:52,085
It's a good party.

602
00:25:52,087 --> 00:25:53,886
Oh, it's great here.

603
00:25:54,555 --> 00:25:56,154
Here you go.

604
00:25:56,156 --> 00:25:57,688
Hey, thanks.

605
00:25:57,690 --> 00:25:59,690
Hey, Lewis, good game tonight.

606
00:25:59,692 --> 00:26:01,258
Hey, what's up,
old-timer?

607
00:26:01,260 --> 00:26:02,292
I wish you was out there.

608
00:26:02,294 --> 00:26:03,693
I'd took you to school.

609
00:26:03,695 --> 00:26:05,895
You must love living
in that fantasy world.

610
00:26:05,897 --> 00:26:06,896
Ooh!

611
00:26:06,898 --> 00:26:09,231
[Laughs] What are
you up to, man?

612
00:26:09,233 --> 00:26:11,099
Just out having some
dinner with my friends.

613
00:26:11,101 --> 00:26:14,535
Oh, really?
Um, this is, uh...

614
00:26:14,537 --> 00:26:15,702
I'm, uh, I'm Larry bird.

615
00:26:15,704 --> 00:26:16,703
How are you?

616
00:26:16,705 --> 00:26:18,705
I mean mark...
Mike. Mike O'Hara.

617
00:26:18,707 --> 00:26:19,972
And, uh...

618
00:26:19,974 --> 00:26:22,207
Uh, j-Jimmy Flaherty.

619
00:26:22,209 --> 00:26:24,943
Yeah, they're an
endangered species
in this town.

620
00:26:24,945 --> 00:26:28,146
2 white, Irish guys
who hate the celtics.

621
00:26:28,148 --> 00:26:29,247
Ain't that right, guys?

622
00:26:29,249 --> 00:26:30,881
Uh...

623
00:26:30,883 --> 00:26:32,215
No.
We love...

624
00:26:32,217 --> 00:26:33,282
we love the celtics

625
00:26:33,284 --> 00:26:34,883
when you were
playing with them.

626
00:26:34,885 --> 00:26:35,884
You were the...
that was the...

627
00:26:35,886 --> 00:26:36,768
the master.

628
00:26:36,769 --> 00:26:37,651
When you were...

629
00:26:37,654 --> 00:26:38,653
but, uh...

630
00:26:38,655 --> 00:26:40,187
You were...
I guess...

631
00:26:40,189 --> 00:26:41,555
I guess lately the celtics...

632
00:26:41,557 --> 00:26:43,156
the leprechauns have
left the building.

633
00:26:43,158 --> 00:26:45,558
Fans like you make me sick.

634
00:26:45,560 --> 00:26:47,092
You love us when we're winning,

635
00:26:47,094 --> 00:26:48,960
and you hate us
when we're losing.

636
00:26:48,962 --> 00:26:50,528
It's pathetic.

637
00:26:50,529 --> 00:26:52,095
You guys should
learn a little
something about loyalty.

638
00:26:52,098 --> 00:26:55,099
Fans like these,
you can have them.

639
00:26:56,635 --> 00:26:58,635
Who needs his lanky ass anyway?

640
00:26:58,637 --> 00:26:59,902
[Laughs]

641
00:26:59,904 --> 00:27:02,204
[Whimpering]

642
00:27:02,206 --> 00:27:05,073
He was overrated
as a player,
I guess.

643
00:27:05,075 --> 00:27:06,240
Yeah, he...

644
00:27:06,242 --> 00:27:08,141
he w-wasn't really
that great.

645
00:27:08,143 --> 00:27:10,143
Yeah, he sucked.

646
00:27:10,145 --> 00:27:11,677
He s-sucked.

647
00:27:11,679 --> 00:27:12,678
Where are our drinks?!

648
00:27:12,680 --> 00:27:14,980
Right away. Oh...

649
00:27:14,982 --> 00:27:18,583
We were at the game
when Seaton hall beat
Boston college.

650
00:27:18,585 --> 00:27:20,351
Get outta here.
Yep. We were there.

651
00:27:20,353 --> 00:27:22,886
Remember, you pulled
a triple-double,
42 points,

652
00:27:22,888 --> 00:27:24,220
20 rebounds, 11 assists?

653
00:27:24,222 --> 00:27:26,255
What a game!

654
00:27:26,257 --> 00:27:28,357
It was a bad day for me.
You kicked our ass!

655
00:27:28,359 --> 00:27:31,259
That's Lewis Scott
the ass-kicker.

656
00:27:31,261 --> 00:27:34,362
Hey, I still got
the ticket stubs from
that game in my wallet.

657
00:27:35,998 --> 00:27:38,631
Here you go.

658
00:27:38,633 --> 00:27:41,066
Here's to you.
Oh, boy!

659
00:27:41,068 --> 00:27:43,234
Oh! There you go!

662
00:27:49,275 --> 00:27:51,308

Let's play drink the drink.

669
00:28:14,397 --> 00:28:16,330
First drink I'm gonna make

670
00:28:16,332 --> 00:28:20,367
is called "Lewis Scott."

671
00:28:20,369 --> 00:28:22,102
Lewis Scott.

672
00:28:22,104 --> 00:28:26,272
This is called
"Jimmy's dick."

00:28:29,043 --> 00:28:31,676
Fat...

675
00:28:31,678 --> 00:28:34,145
But it fills again.

676
00:28:34,147 --> 00:28:35,679
Ha!

677
00:28:35,681 --> 00:28:39,149
This one's called...

678
00:28:39,151 --> 00:28:41,050
"The Boston Celtic"...

679
00:28:41,052 --> 00:28:43,685
it's weak 'cause it's white.

680
00:28:43,687 --> 00:28:45,053
Man, sarcastically:
Oh, that's funny.

681
00:28:45,055 --> 00:28:50,958
The ladies always...
The added touch...

682
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:53,160
[Slurping] That's it.

683
00:28:53,162 --> 00:28:55,662
Drink it all up.

684
00:28:55,664 --> 00:28:57,263
Aaah!

Whoa!

687
00:29:00,934 --> 00:29:02,567
Night's not over.

688
00:29:02,568 --> 00:29:04,201
I know this little
after-hours bar we can
take you to.

689
00:29:04,203 --> 00:29:06,102
Oh, no, no, no, no.
I couldn't. I couldn't.

690
00:29:06,104 --> 00:29:08,070
I gotta go to practice
in the morning.

691
00:29:08,072 --> 00:29:12,107
Well, I'd love to stay
and throw up,

692
00:29:12,109 --> 00:29:16,244
but I gotta beat
these sons of bitches.

693
00:29:16,246 --> 00:29:18,246
You hear that, Boston!

I'm a plumber.

00:30:59,363 --> 00:31:00,962
What happened last night?!

721
00:31:00,964 --> 00:31:03,164
He must have done this
when he passed out.

722
00:31:03,166 --> 00:31:05,366
You kidnapped him.

723
00:31:05,368 --> 00:31:07,134
I did not kidnap anybody!

724
00:31:07,136 --> 00:31:08,869
Well, the shooting guard
for the Utah jazz

725
00:31:08,871 --> 00:31:10,170
is duct taped in my bed,

726
00:31:10,172 --> 00:31:11,504
and I don't think
he did it himself.

727
00:31:11,506 --> 00:31:13,138
I thought you just wanted
to look him in the eye?!

728
00:31:13,140 --> 00:31:15,240
Oh, I'm never gonna
drink hard liquor again...

729
00:31:15,242 --> 00:31:16,474
only beer, wine,
and creme de menthe.

730
00:31:16,476 --> 00:31:18,909
Look, we gotta
get him outta here.

731
00:31:18,911 --> 00:31:20,477
I agree.
OK.

732
00:31:20,479 --> 00:31:23,446
But first we have
to do something.

733
00:31:29,152 --> 00:31:30,384
Oh, look at that.

734
00:31:30,386 --> 00:31:31,918
We've gotta put a hat on
or something.

735
00:31:31,920 --> 00:31:32,919
No! We gotta go!

736
00:31:32,921 --> 00:31:34,353
Put on a Celtic's hat
on the guy.

737
00:31:34,355 --> 00:31:35,954
All right. All right.

738
00:31:42,428 --> 00:31:43,960
You call his room again?

739
00:31:43,962 --> 00:31:45,428
I called 5 minutes ago,
coach. He's not there.

740
00:31:45,430 --> 00:31:47,647
Well, I'll tell you what.

741
00:31:47,648 --> 00:31:49,865
Wait 5 minutes, OK?
And then<i> call again!</i>

742
00:31:52,169 --> 00:31:53,868
Oh, man...
we should get going.

743
00:31:53,870 --> 00:31:55,202
Oh, when the boys see this.

744
00:31:55,204 --> 00:31:57,337
Seventh game of the finals
and he ditches practice.

745
00:31:57,339 --> 00:31:58,438
Grant hill wouldn't
have done this.

746
00:31:58,440 --> 00:32:00,006
Grant hill would have
gone to church,

747
00:32:00,008 --> 00:32:01,441
and he'd come
to practice early.

748
00:32:01,443 --> 00:32:03,309
I'm stuck with Lewis Scott.

749
00:32:07,181 --> 00:32:09,114
Oh, watch... watch his neck.

750
00:32:09,116 --> 00:32:10,215
Oh.

751
00:32:10,217 --> 00:32:11,783
We don't need Scott.

752
00:32:11,784 --> 00:32:13,350
You need to bench him
to teach him a lesson.

753
00:32:13,353 --> 00:32:14,452
Hey, that's what I'll do.

754
00:32:14,454 --> 00:32:16,454
I'll bench him...
bench my high-scorer.

755
00:32:16,456 --> 00:32:17,555
The fans won't mind. No.

756
00:32:17,557 --> 00:32:19,189
They won't want me too dead.

757
00:32:19,191 --> 00:32:21,090
OK, we just gotta
get him outside.

758
00:32:21,092 --> 00:32:23,058
Then he can go
wherever the hell
he wants to go.

759
00:32:23,060 --> 00:32:25,493
Jesus.
Oh, no! He's comin' to!

760
00:32:25,495 --> 00:32:28,262
Just relax and enjoy the ride.

Don't worry.
He doesn't even

00:33:02,056 --> 00:33:04,189
You want some of this, huh?!

778
00:33:04,191 --> 00:33:06,090
Aah! Oh!

Hold it right there, ball hog!

782
00:33:11,329 --> 00:33:13,562
Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun!
Gun! Gun! Gun! Gun!

783
00:33:13,564 --> 00:33:17,465
Smile for the barrel.

784
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:19,266
All right.

785
00:33:19,268 --> 00:33:20,967
Get upstairs now!

786
00:33:20,969 --> 00:33:22,234
Watch yourself.

787
00:33:22,236 --> 00:33:25,003
Get upstairs!

788
00:33:25,005 --> 00:33:26,037
Yo, coach,

789
00:33:26,039 --> 00:33:28,039
I'll play.

790
00:33:28,041 --> 00:33:29,340
Just give me a chance.

791
00:33:29,342 --> 00:33:31,041
I can handle that rock.

792
00:33:31,043 --> 00:33:32,409
I'll call you
if I need you, lurch.

793
00:33:32,411 --> 00:33:35,044
Don't dog me, coach.

794
00:33:35,046 --> 00:33:37,079
I've got the bad crap.

795
00:33:37,081 --> 00:33:39,114
Well, I'll tell you what.

796
00:33:39,115 --> 00:33:41,148
You take the bad crap
and this basketball

797
00:33:41,151 --> 00:33:43,050
and<i> do the drills!</i>

798
00:33:43,052 --> 00:33:44,518
Now!

799
00:33:46,255 --> 00:33:48,288
Bad crap.
I'll call again.

800
00:33:48,290 --> 00:33:50,123
Good idea.

801
00:33:56,330 --> 00:33:59,064
I didn't know
you even had a gun.

802
00:33:59,066 --> 00:34:00,532
Oh, yeah.

803
00:34:00,534 --> 00:34:02,433
It's a Russian toz 35
free pistol.

804
00:34:02,435 --> 00:34:04,334
Ragnar skanäker won the gold

805
00:34:04,336 --> 00:34:06,035
in the '72 Olympics with it.

806
00:34:06,037 --> 00:34:08,504
I traded a pair
of gordie howe skates
for it.

807
00:34:08,506 --> 00:34:10,405
What is this, man?

808
00:34:10,407 --> 00:34:13,274
I thought you two
were Utah fans.

809
00:34:14,543 --> 00:34:15,742
Yeah, right.

810
00:34:15,744 --> 00:34:18,094
Then what is it? Racism?

811
00:34:18,095 --> 00:34:20,445
Is this backlash
from the oj Simpson verdict?

812
00:34:20,448 --> 00:34:22,414
What?! This has
nothing to do with racism.

813
00:34:22,416 --> 00:34:24,349
If the sox were
in a pennant race
with the orioles,

814
00:34:24,351 --> 00:34:27,051
we'd tie up Cal ripken Jr.

815
00:34:27,053 --> 00:34:28,285
He's as white as they come.

816
00:34:28,287 --> 00:34:30,053
Well, why don't you go
get his white ass?

817
00:34:32,290 --> 00:34:34,523
Look, we just need a little time
to figure this out.

818
00:34:34,525 --> 00:34:36,424
Why don't you go get us
some coffee, some food, OK?

819
00:34:36,426 --> 00:34:37,591
Let me figure
this thing through.

820
00:34:37,593 --> 00:34:39,359
Yeah, OK.

821
00:34:39,361 --> 00:34:41,494
I'll get us
some bananas,
some pancake mix,

822
00:34:41,496 --> 00:34:43,395
make some
banana pancakes.
OK.

823
00:34:43,397 --> 00:34:45,397
Some egg, sausages, bacon,

824
00:34:45,399 --> 00:34:47,198
make
a Spanish omelette.
Whatever.

825
00:34:47,200 --> 00:34:49,233
Oh, let's see.
We can go Italian.

826
00:34:49,235 --> 00:34:50,500
We could go Chinese, Greek...

827
00:34:50,502 --> 00:34:52,268
I got a great Dutch place...

828
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:53,736
Jimmy, we're not having
a party!

829
00:34:53,738 --> 00:34:55,437
Just get some coffee,
some food!

830
00:34:55,439 --> 00:34:57,439
Well, we want
to make it nice for him.

831
00:34:57,441 --> 00:34:59,541
I'll get it myself, OK?

832
00:34:59,543 --> 00:35:01,376
Who are you, man?

833
00:35:01,378 --> 00:35:04,445
Some bitter
ex-high-school player

834
00:35:04,447 --> 00:35:06,180
who never really made it?

835
00:35:06,182 --> 00:35:08,415
You sit around watchin' sports

836
00:35:08,417 --> 00:35:10,250
criticizing professional
athletes

837
00:35:10,252 --> 00:35:12,318
'cause you wish
it was you out there?

838
00:35:12,320 --> 00:35:18,323
You are so far off...

839
00:35:18,325 --> 00:35:20,358
It's sad.

840
00:35:25,531 --> 00:35:28,431
Watch his ass!

841
00:35:32,370 --> 00:35:35,537
You let him
talk to you like that
in front of people?

842
00:35:35,539 --> 00:35:36,771
What do you mean?

843
00:35:36,773 --> 00:35:37,538
What do I mean?!

844
00:35:37,540 --> 00:35:39,273
He's so condescending.

845
00:35:39,275 --> 00:35:41,308
[Mimicking] Watch his ass!

846
00:35:41,310 --> 00:35:43,410
[Siren]

847
00:35:43,412 --> 00:35:45,845
Whoa!

848
00:35:45,847 --> 00:35:48,080
Hold it right there!
You're under arrest!

849
00:35:48,082 --> 00:35:49,081
Hey, kev.

850
00:35:49,083 --> 00:35:51,149
Hey, Mike. What's up?

851
00:35:51,151 --> 00:35:53,151
Ha ha.

852
00:35:53,153 --> 00:35:54,352
Scared you, didn't I?

853
00:35:54,354 --> 00:35:56,454
Hey, what's new, man?

854
00:35:56,456 --> 00:35:59,457
New?
Yeah.

855
00:35:59,459 --> 00:36:02,359
Officer! I'm the guy
who had his car stolen!

856
00:36:02,361 --> 00:36:04,294
Yeah, I understand.
Do me a favor...
stand over

857
00:36:04,296 --> 00:36:06,129
by where your car
used to be, and I'll be
right with you.

858
00:36:06,131 --> 00:36:07,730
Are you serious?

859
00:36:07,732 --> 00:36:08,864
Big game tomorrow, huh?

860
00:36:08,866 --> 00:36:10,365
Kevin: Yeah.
Celtics have got to win.

861
00:36:10,367 --> 00:36:11,816
They've gotta win.

862
00:36:11,817 --> 00:36:13,266
You know what?
I wanted to ask you
something.

863
00:36:13,269 --> 00:36:14,768
I'm sure you guys have
a lot to chat about,

864
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,336
what about
my fucking car, man?!

865
00:36:16,338 --> 00:36:17,837
That Porsche was 2 months old!

866
00:36:17,839 --> 00:36:19,205
We do the best we can, sir.

867
00:36:19,207 --> 00:36:21,440
I truly am sorry.

868
00:36:21,442 --> 00:36:23,208
I realize without that nice car

869
00:36:23,210 --> 00:36:25,443
you have
absolutely no chance
of getting laid.

870
00:36:25,445 --> 00:36:28,145
That's a real tragedy.

871
00:36:28,147 --> 00:36:29,579
Now, step back!

872
00:36:29,581 --> 00:36:32,348
I'll be with you in a moment.

873
00:36:32,350 --> 00:36:34,850
He talks to you like you're
his little bitch or something.

874
00:36:34,852 --> 00:36:36,351
Bitch?
Yeah.
I wouldn't be surprised

875
00:36:36,353 --> 00:36:38,252
if he comes back
with a pair of pumps,

876
00:36:38,254 --> 00:36:40,754
some hot pants, and a little
satin tube top for you.

877
00:36:40,756 --> 00:36:43,389
You know, I was thinking.

878
00:36:43,391 --> 00:36:44,456
Yeah?

879
00:36:44,458 --> 00:36:46,524
Lewis Scott is killin' us.

880
00:36:46,526 --> 00:36:48,158
I hate that guy.

881
00:36:48,160 --> 00:36:49,225
You know
what somebody should do?

882
00:36:49,227 --> 00:36:52,828
Somebody should grab
Lewis Scott,

883
00:36:52,830 --> 00:36:54,462
tie him up...
yeah.

884
00:36:54,464 --> 00:36:57,465
And hold him until after
we finish that game
tomorrow.

885
00:36:57,467 --> 00:37:00,134
You know what? I'm in.

886
00:37:00,136 --> 00:37:01,336
And I'm crazy enough to do it.

887
00:37:01,337 --> 00:37:03,737
I'd do it. I would.

888
00:37:03,739 --> 00:37:06,573
You know, my teammates
are gonna come lookin'
for me.

889
00:37:06,575 --> 00:37:08,274
Why?

890
00:37:08,276 --> 00:37:09,842
It's so unusual
you're not at practice?

891
00:37:09,844 --> 00:37:11,160
You're in big trouble

892
00:37:11,161 --> 00:37:12,477
for messin'
with Lewis Scott.
You know that, right?

893
00:37:12,479 --> 00:37:15,446
Look, j-j-just shut up, OK?

894
00:37:15,448 --> 00:37:18,148
Jimmy's in control now.

895
00:37:18,150 --> 00:37:20,450
See, I can talk
in the third person, too.

896
00:37:20,452 --> 00:37:23,286
Jimmy Flaherty
wants Lewis Scott
to just shut his trap.

897
00:37:23,288 --> 00:37:26,188
'Cause Jimmy Flaherty is
just so tired of Lewis Scott's

898
00:37:26,190 --> 00:37:28,823
in-your-head,
mental telepathy bullshit.

899
00:37:28,825 --> 00:37:31,425
Yeah, well,
Jimmy wouldn't talk
to Lewis Scott like that

900
00:37:31,427 --> 00:37:33,226
if he didn't have a gun,

901
00:37:33,228 --> 00:37:36,562
'cause Lewis Scott
would pulverize his
big, fat, frumpy ass.

902
00:37:36,564 --> 00:37:40,399
But Jimmy Flaherty
does have a gun, doesn't he?

903
00:37:42,202 --> 00:37:44,569
Oh! Wait... hey! Come on.

904
00:37:44,571 --> 00:37:46,837
You don't wanna play
with Flaherty now.

905
00:37:46,839 --> 00:37:48,405
He's crazy.

906
00:37:48,407 --> 00:37:49,923
Yeah?

907
00:37:49,924 --> 00:37:51,440
Well,
I'm about to snatch
your asshole out

908
00:37:51,443 --> 00:37:52,809
and use it as a peephole.

909
00:37:52,811 --> 00:37:55,244
Sit down! Please!

910
00:37:55,246 --> 00:37:57,846
Please, Lewis, aw,
don't make me shoot you, man!

911
00:37:57,848 --> 00:37:59,848
You're not gonna
shoot me, Jimmy.

912
00:37:59,850 --> 00:38:00,949
You don't have the berries.

913
00:38:00,951 --> 00:38:02,350
I do have the berries!

914
00:38:02,352 --> 00:38:03,673
If you don't sit down
I'm gonna...

915
00:38:04,520 --> 00:38:06,219
shit!

916
00:38:06,221 --> 00:38:07,386
Man, are you crazy?!

917
00:38:07,388 --> 00:38:08,820
That could've been my head!

918
00:38:08,822 --> 00:38:10,555
I wish it was!

919
00:38:10,557 --> 00:38:14,425
That was
my 1986 bill Buckner ball.

920
00:38:14,427 --> 00:38:15,426
[Sirens approaching]

921
00:38:15,428 --> 00:38:17,828
Say somebody
grabbed him yesterday

922
00:38:17,830 --> 00:38:19,429
and they let go of him today.

923
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:21,230
No, kidnapping is kidnapping.

924
00:38:21,232 --> 00:38:23,232
It doesn't matter
if it's one day or 3 days
or whatever.

925
00:38:23,234 --> 00:38:24,566
I mean, you kidnap a guy,

926
00:38:24,568 --> 00:38:26,301
you kidnap a guy,
you know what I mean?

927
00:38:26,303 --> 00:38:28,303
I mean, just do it.

928
00:38:28,305 --> 00:38:31,973
So you... you would
hold on to him

929
00:38:31,975 --> 00:38:34,442
until after the celtics
win the championship.

930
00:38:34,444 --> 00:38:37,878
Me as a policeman
sworn to uphold the law?

931
00:38:37,880 --> 00:38:40,147
I could never say that.

932
00:38:40,148 --> 00:38:42,415
But as a celtics fan
I must reply yes.

933
00:38:42,417 --> 00:38:43,849
No, we're just jokin'
around anyway.

934
00:38:43,851 --> 00:38:46,418
I mean, we're not talkin'
about a crime here

935
00:38:46,420 --> 00:38:48,453
or anything, are we?

936
00:38:48,455 --> 00:38:52,423
No. Of course not.

937
00:38:52,425 --> 00:38:54,425
What?

938
00:38:54,427 --> 00:38:56,960
OK. Give my love
to Deb.

939
00:38:56,962 --> 00:38:58,428
All right.
See you later. Yeah.

940
00:38:58,430 --> 00:39:00,329
Hey, I got no reason
to be concerned,
do I, Mike?

941
00:39:01,865 --> 00:39:02,864
Huh?

942
00:39:02,866 --> 00:39:04,298
Kevin, you're losin' it, man.

943
00:39:04,300 --> 00:39:05,732
Take care of yourself.

944
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:07,900
Stay out of trouble, all right?

945
00:39:07,902 --> 00:39:10,069
Right.

946
00:39:10,071 --> 00:39:12,604
OK, Mr. Germany,
where were we?

947
00:39:12,606 --> 00:39:16,441
Scott: What do you collect
all this junk for, anyway?

948
00:39:16,443 --> 00:39:18,543
I like it.
It's a hobby.

949
00:39:18,545 --> 00:39:20,995
It's pathetic.

950
00:39:20,996 --> 00:39:23,446
All these pictures
of other people's
achievements,

951
00:39:23,449 --> 00:39:25,982
and what have you done?
What's your claim to fame?

952
00:39:25,984 --> 00:39:29,885
You think Larry bird has
a picture of you on his wall

953
00:39:29,887 --> 00:39:32,520
with your hand down a toilet
wrangling a turd.

954
00:39:32,522 --> 00:39:34,855
He doesn't even know
you exist...

955
00:39:34,857 --> 00:39:36,623
And you met him.

956
00:39:36,625 --> 00:39:38,124
You might as well take that gun

957
00:39:38,126 --> 00:39:39,125
and just put it in your mouth

958
00:39:39,127 --> 00:39:40,426
and blow your brains out.

959
00:39:40,428 --> 00:39:43,662
Go ahead. I know
you thought about it.

960
00:39:43,664 --> 00:39:46,031
Holidays, your birthday,

961
00:39:46,033 --> 00:39:48,933
how about new year's
when you're sittin' there
all alone

962
00:39:48,935 --> 00:39:51,068
with your hand down your pants

963
00:39:51,070 --> 00:39:54,871
playin' with your knob
and everyone else out there
havin' fun.

964
00:39:54,873 --> 00:39:57,540
Go ahead, Jimmy. Do it.

965
00:39:57,542 --> 00:39:59,909
Make the pain go away.

966
00:39:59,911 --> 00:40:02,044
Stifle it, Scott!

967
00:40:03,847 --> 00:40:07,548
That's exactly why your
so-called friend Mike
treats you that way.

968
00:40:07,550 --> 00:40:09,950
'Cause you have
no identity of your own.

969
00:40:09,952 --> 00:40:11,952
Listen, he treats me just fine.

970
00:40:11,954 --> 00:40:15,622
Hmm! Took me 2 seconds
to figure out

971
00:40:15,624 --> 00:40:18,124
who the man
in the relationship was.

972
00:40:18,126 --> 00:40:22,127
He wouldn't
even let you make
the banana pancakes.

973
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:26,630
I was gonna make 'em, too!

974
00:40:26,632 --> 00:40:27,964
I was in the mood!

975
00:40:27,966 --> 00:40:29,932
Does he make you
hold his peenie

976
00:40:29,934 --> 00:40:32,134
when he takes a piss,
too, Jimmy?

977
00:40:32,136 --> 00:40:33,535
Yeah.

978
00:40:33,537 --> 00:40:34,986
[Remembering]
I wouldn't be surprised

979
00:40:34,987 --> 00:40:36,436
if he comes back
with a pair of pumps,

980
00:40:36,439 --> 00:40:38,539
some hot pants,
and a little satin
tube top...

981
00:40:38,541 --> 00:40:41,174
come on! Make us some breakfast!

982
00:40:41,176 --> 00:40:42,942
Coming!

983
00:40:42,944 --> 00:40:44,076
Hey, listen,
I ran into Kevin
while I was out there.

984
00:40:44,078 --> 00:40:46,445
Hinted around
about our situation.

985
00:40:46,447 --> 00:40:48,680
He says it doesn't matter
if we let him go now or later,

986
00:40:48,682 --> 00:40:49,681
it's the same thing.

987
00:40:49,683 --> 00:40:50,848
So that got me thinking...

988
00:40:50,850 --> 00:40:53,417
oh!

989
00:40:53,419 --> 00:40:55,519
What'd you do that for?!

990
00:40:55,521 --> 00:40:57,487
I am sick and tired
of your bullshit!

991
00:40:57,489 --> 00:41:00,456
What the hell
has gotten into you?!

992
00:41:00,458 --> 00:41:02,024
Huh?!

993
00:41:02,026 --> 00:41:04,426
Oh, no.

994
00:41:07,898 --> 00:41:10,965
You really shouldn't leave
Jimmy all alone, Mike.

995
00:41:10,967 --> 00:41:12,032
You just...

996
00:41:12,034 --> 00:41:15,168
Jimmy, Jimmy,
don't listen to him!

997
00:41:15,170 --> 00:41:17,637
Yes, master,
I will do whatever
you tell me.

998
00:41:17,639 --> 00:41:19,672
Why don't you pick on somebody
with your own I.Q.?

999
00:41:19,674 --> 00:41:21,840
How about someone like you?

1000
00:41:21,842 --> 00:41:23,942
I'd like to get him in a room.

1001
00:41:23,944 --> 00:41:25,944
I'd like to tie him down...

1002
00:41:25,946 --> 00:41:28,146
And I would like
to beat the livin' snot
out of him,

1003
00:41:28,148 --> 00:41:29,981
because there are
some people in this world

1004
00:41:29,983 --> 00:41:32,450
that... that's all
they really understand.

1005
00:41:32,452 --> 00:41:34,051
You rationalize with them.

1006
00:41:34,053 --> 00:41:36,086
You try to listen
to their side
of the story,

1007
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:38,221
but ultimately, guys,
it only comes down
to one thing.

1008
00:41:38,223 --> 00:41:39,922
Unh! A good beating.

1009
00:41:39,924 --> 00:41:41,156
Maybe something happened
to him, coach.

1010
00:41:41,158 --> 00:41:43,008
Maybe he got hurt.

1011
00:41:43,009 --> 00:41:44,859
Yeah, like this
is the first time
he's pulled this.

1012
00:41:44,861 --> 00:41:45,993
Listen to me.

1013
00:41:45,995 --> 00:41:47,027
Oh, Mikey,
I can't believe
I hit you.

1014
00:41:47,029 --> 00:41:48,461
He gave me the mogo eye.

1015
00:41:48,463 --> 00:41:49,462
It's OK. Listen,

1016
00:41:49,464 --> 00:41:51,063
I was talkin' to Kevin, OK?

1017
00:41:51,065 --> 00:41:52,898
We are definitely
in deep trouble.

1018
00:41:52,900 --> 00:41:55,200
We're probably
goin' to jail, so...

1019
00:41:55,202 --> 00:41:56,568
what'll we do?

1020
00:41:56,569 --> 00:41:57,935
There's no choice.
Look. All right, look.

1021
00:41:57,938 --> 00:42:02,040
I was thinkin'
if we let him go now,

1022
00:42:02,042 --> 00:42:03,542
our lives are gonna
go down in flames

1023
00:42:03,543 --> 00:42:05,043
and we're gonna have
nothing to show for it, right?

1024
00:42:05,045 --> 00:42:07,545
But if we hold on to him,

1025
00:42:07,547 --> 00:42:09,947
keep him till after the game,

1026
00:42:09,949 --> 00:42:11,248
and the celtics win,

1027
00:42:11,250 --> 00:42:13,583
well, our lives are gonna
go down in flames,

1028
00:42:13,585 --> 00:42:16,852
but at least we
will have contributed
to the celtics' victory.

1029
00:42:16,854 --> 00:42:19,154
I like this very much.

1030
00:42:19,156 --> 00:42:20,589
All our lives we've taken,

1031
00:42:20,590 --> 00:42:22,023
we've taken,
we've taken
from the celtics.

1032
00:42:22,025 --> 00:42:23,991
Now I think it's time
to give something back.

1033
00:42:23,993 --> 00:42:26,994
Look, on a team,
everybody's got a job
to do, right?

1034
00:42:26,996 --> 00:42:29,830
Yeah.
So this is our job!

1035
00:42:29,832 --> 00:42:31,932
Our job is
to cover Lewis Scott,

1036
00:42:31,934 --> 00:42:34,167
and if we can hold onto him,

1037
00:42:34,169 --> 00:42:38,004
maybe,
just maybe, we can win
that championship!

1038
00:42:38,006 --> 00:42:39,138
Yeah, but it wouldn't be

1039
00:42:39,140 --> 00:42:41,039
a fair win, now, would it?

1040
00:42:41,041 --> 00:42:43,841
There'll always be
an asterisk next to it
in the record book.

1041
00:42:43,843 --> 00:42:46,543
Yeah, but it would have
our names next to it.

1042
00:42:46,545 --> 00:42:50,547
What kind of loser
would want to be
an asterisk?

1043
00:42:50,549 --> 00:42:55,018
I would very much
like to be one.

1044
00:42:55,020 --> 00:42:58,021
Let's lead our celtics
to victory!

1045
00:42:58,023 --> 00:43:01,624
Lurch, just in case,
we're gonna run the plays.

1046
00:43:01,626 --> 00:43:02,891
All right,
so do the best you can.

1047
00:43:02,893 --> 00:43:04,926
It's all I'm gonna ask.
All right.

1048
00:43:04,928 --> 00:43:08,262
Coach, I'll not let
my homies down.

1049
00:43:08,264 --> 00:43:11,231
Well, your homies are gonna
love that. That's great.

1050
00:43:11,233 --> 00:43:14,033
Come on!
Give me the rock.

1051
00:43:14,035 --> 00:43:15,200
Aah!

1052
00:43:18,238 --> 00:43:20,271
I just...

1053
00:43:20,273 --> 00:43:22,306
I hate my life.

1054
00:43:22,308 --> 00:43:24,074
Mom, come on.
Give him another chance.

1055
00:43:24,076 --> 00:43:26,943
I have given him
so many chances.

1056
00:43:26,945 --> 00:43:30,313
I love him,
but he's just not good for us.

1057
00:43:30,315 --> 00:43:33,149
Then am I only gonna
get to see him
on Sundays

1058
00:43:33,151 --> 00:43:35,184
like all my other
divorced friends?

1059
00:43:35,186 --> 00:43:37,152
Tommy...

1060
00:43:37,154 --> 00:43:38,987
Football season's comin' up.

1061
00:43:38,989 --> 00:43:41,255
I don't think your dad's
gonna see you on Sunday.

1062
00:43:41,257 --> 00:43:42,956
Maybe February.

1063
00:43:42,958 --> 00:43:46,626
2-55! Hut! Hut! Hut! Go!

1064
00:43:46,628 --> 00:43:47,994
Blitz 'em!
Blitz 'em! Blitz 'em!

1065
00:43:47,996 --> 00:43:49,862

or I'll blow this place
to kingdom come.

1411
00:58:08,214 --> 00:58:10,013
Come on!
Get in the van, man!

1412
00:58:10,015 --> 00:58:11,581
I leave you alone for 2 minutes

1413
00:58:11,583 --> 00:58:13,015
and look what happens.

1414
00:58:13,017 --> 00:58:15,050
Aah! Ohh!

1415
00:58:17,854 --> 00:58:18,853
Let him go, Jimmy.

1416
00:58:18,855 --> 00:58:20,371
You'd better
let me go right now,

1417
00:58:20,372 --> 00:58:21,888
otherwise we're gonna have
a weenie roast here.

1418
00:58:21,891 --> 00:58:23,056
Do it!

1419
00:58:23,058 --> 00:58:24,958
No can do, man.

1420
00:58:24,959 --> 00:58:26,859
I'm willing to sacrifice
for our boys in green.

1421
00:58:26,861 --> 00:58:29,027
You're willing
to sacrifice
my nuts?

1422
00:58:29,029 --> 00:58:31,162
What is the matter with you?!

1423
00:58:31,164 --> 00:58:33,030
Did he get in your head again?

1424
00:58:33,032 --> 00:58:35,232
No, it's completely blank.

1425
00:58:35,234 --> 00:58:36,533
Then you must be
willing to die.

1426
00:58:36,535 --> 00:58:37,867
Jimmy!

1427
00:58:39,470 --> 00:58:40,869
Jimmy!

1428
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:42,237
No one's gonna die

1429
00:58:42,239 --> 00:58:44,038
'cause that
old Celtic's lighter
hasn't worked

1430
00:58:44,040 --> 00:58:45,572
since dukakis was governor.

1431
00:58:45,574 --> 00:58:47,206
Oh, yeah?
Uhh!

1432
00:58:47,208 --> 00:58:49,074
Let him go, Jimmy.

1433
00:58:49,076 --> 00:58:52,110
Give me that thing!
Get in the van!

1434
00:58:52,979 --> 00:58:54,545
Help him with his bowl.

1435
00:58:55,848 --> 00:58:56,913
Be careful.

1436
00:58:56,915 --> 00:58:59,048
It's a top of the line
quiet flush.

1437
00:59:00,918 --> 00:59:04,019
Thanks for telling me
about the lighter.

1438
00:59:07,958 --> 00:59:09,057
Mike: I'm soaking wet.

1439
00:59:09,059 --> 00:59:11,559
The van smells like gasoline.

1440
00:59:11,561 --> 00:59:13,193
Give me a light.

1441
00:59:14,963 --> 00:59:17,129
Jimmy:
Well, look at that.
It works. [Chuckles]

1442
00:59:17,131 --> 00:59:19,131
Whoa.

1443
00:59:20,234 --> 00:59:21,900
Hey, guys...

1444
00:59:21,902 --> 00:59:25,670
Please don't take this from me.

1445
00:59:25,672 --> 00:59:29,507
Just let me go.
I won't turn you in,
I swear.

1446
00:59:29,509 --> 00:59:31,675
Look, you don't want
to go to jail.

1447
00:59:31,677 --> 00:59:35,679
Come on, Mike,
you got a wife and a kid.

1448
00:59:35,681 --> 00:59:38,114
Jesus, Jimmy, you got...

1449
00:59:38,116 --> 00:59:40,216
you got Mike,
and he's got
a wife and a kid.

1450
00:59:40,218 --> 00:59:43,619
Please, guys,
don't take this from me.

1451
00:59:43,621 --> 00:59:46,021
You don't deserve it.

1452
00:59:46,023 --> 00:59:47,188
What, and you do?

1453
00:59:47,190 --> 00:59:48,656
You're damn right I do!

1454
00:59:48,658 --> 00:59:50,224
At least I'd appreciate it.

1455
00:59:50,226 --> 00:59:53,527
I would cherish
every minute
of every game!

1456
00:59:53,529 --> 00:59:55,061
I wouldn't be late
for practice.

1457
00:59:55,063 --> 00:59:57,029
I wouldn't be ragging
on my teammates.

1458
00:59:57,031 --> 00:59:58,997
I would work harder
than anybody!

1459
00:59:58,999 --> 00:59:59,998
You don't think I work hard?

1460
01:00:00,000 --> 01:00:01,516
No.

1461
01:00:01,517 --> 01:00:03,033
Man, I sacrificed
to get where I am.

1462
01:00:03,036 --> 01:00:04,668
I gave up everything
for the game.

1463
01:00:04,670 --> 01:00:05,902
Oh, big deal!

1464
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,670
I would've given it up, too.

1465
01:00:07,672 --> 01:00:09,038
Would you have, Mike?

1466
01:00:09,040 --> 01:00:11,140
What do I have to give up?

1467
01:00:13,244 --> 01:00:16,678
Yeah, I'm the one born
with the talent.

1468
01:00:16,680 --> 01:00:19,180
Not you.

1469
01:00:19,182 --> 01:00:22,316
I'm sorry, but don't
take it out on me.

1470
01:00:22,318 --> 01:00:24,651
You don't think
I've got the talent?

1471
01:00:25,920 --> 01:00:28,020
You're a gym teacher.

1472
01:00:28,022 --> 01:00:29,921
What do you think?

1473
01:00:31,090 --> 01:00:32,923
Pull over.

1474
01:00:32,925 --> 01:00:33,925
Lewis: Come on, Mr. p.E.!

1475
01:00:33,926 --> 01:00:36,059
Show me what you got, huh?

1476
01:00:36,061 --> 01:00:37,326
Good evening,
ladies and gentlemen.

1477
01:00:37,328 --> 01:00:40,228
I'm Bob cousy,
here at labresky park

1478
01:00:40,230 --> 01:00:42,330
with the skyline
of Boston, Massachusetts

1479
01:00:42,332 --> 01:00:44,582
in behind me,

1480
01:00:44,583 --> 01:00:46,833
here at this 4:00 A.M.
demand grudge match,

1481
01:00:46,836 --> 01:00:50,003
a David and goliath contest
between Lewis Scott,

1482
01:00:50,005 --> 01:00:52,205
nba all-star,

1483
01:00:52,207 --> 01:00:54,040
and Mike O'Hara, a gym teacher

1484
01:00:54,042 --> 01:00:55,941
from charlestown, Massachusetts

1485
01:00:55,943 --> 01:00:57,008
with a spastic colon

1486
01:00:57,010 --> 01:00:59,310
and a few surprises
up his sleeve, ma.

1487
01:00:59,312 --> 01:01:03,213
Is Mike O'Hara's dream dead?
Well, we'll certainly see

1488
01:01:03,215 --> 01:01:05,281
after the word
from this sponsor.

1489
01:01:05,283 --> 01:01:07,316
[Imitating lewis]
Hi, I'm Lewis Scott.

1490
01:01:07,318 --> 01:01:09,918
As well as being
a professional
basketball player,

1491
01:01:09,920 --> 01:01:11,119
I'm also a denture wearer.

1492
01:01:11,121 --> 01:01:12,120
Together: Shut up!

1493
01:01:12,122 --> 01:01:13,287
Let's play!

1494
01:01:13,289 --> 01:01:15,289
All right.
God!

1495
01:01:15,291 --> 01:01:18,592
Lewis: You reach and I teach.
Shut up and play.

1496
01:01:20,662 --> 01:01:22,161
If you was a midget,
I'd still take

1497
01:01:22,163 --> 01:01:23,162
your little ass to the hole.

1498
01:01:23,164 --> 01:01:25,164
If you was crippled,

1499
01:01:25,166 --> 01:01:26,932
I'd have you rubbing that nub.

1500
01:01:26,934 --> 01:01:27,983
Damn it!

1501
01:01:27,984 --> 01:01:29,033
If you was an old woman
with no teeth,

1502
01:01:29,036 --> 01:01:30,969
I'd still have you coming.

1503
01:01:30,971 --> 01:01:32,203
Yeah, I get it.

1504
01:01:32,205 --> 01:01:33,938
If you was my bitch,

1505
01:01:33,940 --> 01:01:35,205
I'd do that to you.

1506
01:01:35,207 --> 01:01:36,940
Shut up!

1507
01:01:36,942 --> 01:01:38,141
Come on, Mike!

1508
01:01:38,143 --> 01:01:39,942
You gotta hit
the weight room, kid.

1509
01:01:39,944 --> 01:01:41,243
Uhh!

1510
01:01:41,245 --> 01:01:43,011
Get up, you fresh fetus.

1511
01:01:43,013 --> 01:01:46,114
Oh, the kid is nice.
The kid is nice.

1512
01:01:46,116 --> 01:01:47,315
Take a breather, Mike.

1513
01:01:47,317 --> 01:01:49,216
I'm gonna shoot 3s.

1514
01:01:49,218 --> 01:01:50,217
You should be in the league.

1515
01:01:50,219 --> 01:01:52,185
You'd make a great ball boy.

1516
01:01:52,187 --> 01:01:54,620
Now get a hold, boy,
'cause it's over!

1517
01:01:54,622 --> 01:01:56,288
It's not over
till I say
it's over!

1518
01:01:56,290 --> 01:01:58,390
Ow! Ohh!

1519
01:01:58,392 --> 01:01:59,958
Oh, jeez.

1520
01:01:59,960 --> 01:02:01,326
Oh, man, are you OK?

1521
01:02:01,328 --> 01:02:02,327
No, I'm not OK!

1522
01:02:02,329 --> 01:02:04,896
Ice!
Get him some ice!

1523
01:02:04,898 --> 01:02:06,197
Uhh!

1524
01:02:08,401 --> 01:02:10,267
All right, give me the key.
Key to what?

1525
01:02:10,269 --> 01:02:12,269
The keys!

1526
01:02:12,271 --> 01:02:14,304
Give him the keys!
Yeah, yeah, key.

1527
01:02:16,374 --> 01:02:18,674
Thank you.

1528
01:02:21,078 --> 01:02:22,977
Jimmy: Scott?

1529
01:02:22,979 --> 01:02:24,211
What, stink hands?

1530
01:02:24,213 --> 01:02:27,314
Are you gonna
turn us in
to the police?

1531
01:02:27,316 --> 01:02:30,050
No.

1532
01:02:30,052 --> 01:02:34,220
I got something
much worse planned
for you 2.

1533
01:02:34,222 --> 01:02:36,188
You're gonna root for me.

1534
01:02:36,190 --> 01:02:37,389
I am not rooting for you!

1535
01:02:37,391 --> 01:02:39,057
Mike.

1536
01:02:39,059 --> 01:02:42,927
I'll see you ladies
at the game.

1537
01:02:42,929 --> 01:02:43,928
You'd better pray I win.

1538
01:02:43,930 --> 01:02:45,663
Otherwise,
you're going to jail.

1539
01:02:47,099 --> 01:02:48,998
Lewis: Hey...

1540
01:02:49,000 --> 01:02:52,668
Wear something purple.

1541
01:02:52,670 --> 01:02:56,672
Wear something purple.

1542
01:02:56,674 --> 01:03:00,442
[Van driving off]

1543
01:03:00,444 --> 01:03:03,344
Lunch is almost ready.

1544
01:03:03,346 --> 01:03:05,312
[Groaning]

1545
01:03:06,915 --> 01:03:09,215
I have nothing to say to you.

1546
01:03:12,920 --> 01:03:14,419
Mike: Ow! Uhh.

1547
01:03:14,421 --> 01:03:16,120
What did you do to your foot?

1548
01:03:16,122 --> 01:03:18,989
I screwed up.

1549
01:03:18,991 --> 01:03:20,323
Oh, Mike.

1550
01:03:20,325 --> 01:03:21,991
So, dad...

1551
01:03:21,993 --> 01:03:23,125
Hmm?

1552
01:03:23,127 --> 01:03:24,459
What do you think
prison will be like?

1553
01:03:24,461 --> 01:03:27,094
Carol: Tommy.

1554
01:03:27,096 --> 01:03:29,329
The paper said
Utah's favored by 2.

1555
01:03:29,331 --> 01:03:31,364
He probably won't
even have to go.

1556
01:03:31,366 --> 01:03:33,466
Look, can we not talk
about sports, OK?

1557
01:03:33,468 --> 01:03:35,434
I just want to spend
a little bit of time
with you guys

1558
01:03:35,436 --> 01:03:37,335
before I...

1559
01:03:39,472 --> 01:03:41,339
You know.

1560
01:03:44,243 --> 01:03:47,277
Uh...

1561
01:03:47,279 --> 01:03:48,911
It's good.

1562
01:03:48,913 --> 01:03:50,913
How's work?

1563
01:03:50,915 --> 01:03:53,015
Mm. Fine.

1564
01:03:53,017 --> 01:03:56,218
Good. How's your friend?
Uh...

1565
01:03:56,220 --> 01:03:58,553
J-Jill?

1566
01:03:58,555 --> 01:04:02,924
Jill moved
to Rhode Island
2 years ago.

1567
01:04:02,926 --> 01:04:05,159
Really?

1568
01:04:05,161 --> 01:04:08,395
No, I didn't mean Jill,
I meant dawn.

1569
01:04:10,298 --> 01:04:13,465
Di... Ane.

1570
01:04:15,969 --> 01:04:17,034
You don't have to do this.

1571
01:04:17,036 --> 01:04:18,301
No, I want to.
I'm interested.

1572
01:04:18,303 --> 01:04:21,437
How is...
how's old Diane, huh?

1573
01:04:21,439 --> 01:04:24,406
Diane's little boy
is turning 8
on Sunday,

1574
01:04:24,408 --> 01:04:26,007
but, uh...

1575
01:04:26,009 --> 01:04:29,243
well, I'm sure
you wouldn't
want to go.

1576
01:04:29,245 --> 01:04:34,014
There's nothing
I would rather do

1577
01:04:34,016 --> 01:04:36,216
on God's green earth

1578
01:04:36,218 --> 01:04:43,522
than go to that
little bastard's
birthday party.

1579
01:04:43,524 --> 01:04:46,157
But I'll be in lock up.

1580
01:04:46,159 --> 01:04:49,960
Grandma,
I've done something
terribly wrong,

1581
01:04:49,962 --> 01:04:51,995
and I might have to go to jail

1582
01:04:51,997 --> 01:04:54,330
and become
some bad man's
boyfriend.

1583
01:04:54,332 --> 01:04:57,132
That's nice, peanut.

1584
01:04:57,134 --> 01:05:00,568
Now, could you
get me a grapefruit
out of the fridge?

1585
01:05:00,570 --> 01:05:05,072
Crowd chanting:
Here we go, celtics!
Here we go!

1586
01:05:05,074 --> 01:05:06,540
Here we go, celtics!

1587
01:05:06,542 --> 01:05:08,441
Here we go!

1588
01:05:09,444 --> 01:05:10,342
Excuse me.

1589
01:05:10,344 --> 01:05:12,310
Here we go, yay!

1590
01:05:12,312 --> 01:05:16,414
Come on, celtics!
Here we go, yes!

1591
01:05:16,416 --> 01:05:18,416
Ha ha!
Here we go, celtics!

1592
01:05:18,418 --> 01:05:21,252
Hey, hey!
You made it.
Ha ha!

1593
01:05:21,254 --> 01:05:24,088
Hey, Mikey!
Hey, Jimmy!

1594
01:05:24,090 --> 01:05:25,389
Game 7, baby!

1595
01:05:25,391 --> 01:05:27,391
We're going all the way, baby!

1596
01:05:27,393 --> 01:05:28,558
We have to root for Utah.

1597
01:05:28,560 --> 01:05:29,992
This is a nightmare!

1598
01:05:29,994 --> 01:05:32,094
I think I'm gonna throw up.

1599
01:05:33,230 --> 01:05:35,230
[Crowd gasping]

1600
01:05:35,232 --> 01:05:38,132
[Gasps]

1601
01:05:38,134 --> 01:05:40,567
I think I need a hug
with my hot dog today,
Suzy.

1602
01:05:41,403 --> 01:05:43,202
Ohh!

1603
01:05:43,204 --> 01:05:45,204
Jimmy, how could you?

1604
01:05:45,206 --> 01:05:47,239
Baby, please.
Let me explain.

1605
01:05:47,241 --> 01:05:48,506
Man: Hey,
what's the deal
with the jerseys?

1606
01:05:48,508 --> 01:05:50,441
Crowd together: Yeah?!

1607
01:05:52,144 --> 01:05:53,543
Isn't it obvious?

1608
01:05:53,545 --> 01:05:55,545
Crowd: No.

1609
01:05:59,517 --> 01:06:04,052
The celtics have lost
the last 2 games, right?

1610
01:06:04,054 --> 01:06:05,386
Crowd: Yeah.

1611
01:06:05,388 --> 01:06:07,454
And who have
we been rooting for?

1612
01:06:07,456 --> 01:06:10,023
The celtics!

1613
01:06:10,025 --> 01:06:12,225
So can't you see?

1614
01:06:12,227 --> 01:06:14,961
We are the bad luck guys.

1615
01:06:14,963 --> 01:06:17,029
It wasn't Chris McCarthy.

1616
01:06:17,031 --> 01:06:18,163
It was us!

1617
01:06:18,165 --> 01:06:22,433
So now,
when we root
for the jazz,

1618
01:06:22,435 --> 01:06:24,535
we're gonna jinx them.

1619
01:06:24,537 --> 01:06:26,503
And then the celtics
are gonna win!

1620
01:06:26,505 --> 01:06:30,039
Huh? All right!

1621
01:06:30,041 --> 01:06:32,541
Here we go, huh?
Here we go!

1622
01:06:32,543 --> 01:06:36,011
Here we go...
Here we go.

1623
01:06:36,013 --> 01:06:37,412
Thanks, Suzy.

1624
01:06:37,414 --> 01:06:39,013
You pulled that one
out of your butt.

1625
01:06:39,015 --> 01:06:40,114
I didn't want to say anything,

1626
01:06:40,116 --> 01:06:42,549
but I knew it was
you 2 all along.

1627
01:06:42,551 --> 01:06:44,417
Good idea.

1628
01:06:46,354 --> 01:06:49,355
Well, bill,
it all comes
down to this,

1629
01:06:49,357 --> 01:06:52,257
the seventh
and final game
of the nba finals.

1630
01:06:52,259 --> 01:06:54,225
Now in case
you've been
out of the country,

1631
01:06:54,227 --> 01:06:56,677
the talk here at the garden is

1632
01:06:56,678 --> 01:06:59,128
that nobody has
seen or heard
from Lewis Scott.

1633
01:06:59,131 --> 01:07:00,530
Where the hell is he?

1634
01:07:00,532 --> 01:07:03,065
Listen up.
He's not coming,
all right?

1635
01:07:03,067 --> 01:07:05,033
So, were gonna
do this without him.

1636
01:07:05,035 --> 01:07:08,136
Utah jazz is not
Lewis Scott,
all right?

1637
01:07:08,138 --> 01:07:11,572
There is nothing
that you guys
can't do, OK?

1638
01:07:11,574 --> 01:07:13,040
I believe in you.

1639
01:07:13,042 --> 01:07:14,742
Believe in yourselves.

1640
01:07:14,743 --> 01:07:16,443
Lurch,
I want you to stand
around the basket,

1641
01:07:16,445 --> 01:07:18,211
just sit there and rebound.

1642
01:07:18,213 --> 01:07:19,478
That's it.
All right?

1643
01:07:19,480 --> 01:07:21,446
But I've got the good stuff.

1644
01:07:21,448 --> 01:07:23,214
No, no, no. Don't start
with the good stuff.

1645
01:07:23,216 --> 01:07:24,748
I don't want to hear
about the stuff.

1646
01:07:24,750 --> 01:07:26,416
I don't want to hear
the Croatian stuff.

1647
01:07:26,418 --> 01:07:29,118
Just do what I say,
stay under the basket,

1648
01:07:29,120 --> 01:07:31,286
and rebound!
Can you do that much?

1649
01:07:31,288 --> 01:07:33,755
If you touch the ball,
I swear to God,
if you take the ball

1650
01:07:33,757 --> 01:07:36,023
and you shoot,
I'll have you deported!

1651
01:07:36,025 --> 01:07:38,025
Where the hell
do you think he is?

1652
01:07:38,027 --> 01:07:40,160
Maybe he had trouble
with the van.

1653
01:07:40,162 --> 01:07:41,427
The engine's been
flooding lately.

1654
01:07:41,429 --> 01:07:43,195
What's happening, gentlemen?

1655
01:07:43,197 --> 01:07:44,429
Good to see you...

1656
01:07:44,431 --> 01:07:46,297
Again.
Hey, Kevin.

1657
01:07:46,299 --> 01:07:48,565
What's with the jerseys?
Don't you think that's
a little overkill...

1658
01:07:48,567 --> 01:07:50,733
Under the circumstances?

1659
01:07:50,735 --> 01:07:53,268
There are
no circumstances.
He escaped.

1660
01:07:53,270 --> 01:07:55,169
No friggin' way.

1661
01:07:55,171 --> 01:07:57,137
You didn't bet
on the celtics, did you?

1662
01:07:57,139 --> 01:07:59,405
Aw, worse.

1663
01:07:59,407 --> 01:08:01,106
Look at this.

1664
01:08:01,108 --> 01:08:02,273
What, you bought
a t-shirt?

1665
01:08:02,275 --> 01:08:04,775
No, I had 20,000
of these made up.

1666
01:08:04,777 --> 01:08:07,310
If they lose,
they're worthless.

1667
01:08:09,280 --> 01:08:11,013
It's a nice design.

1668
01:08:11,015 --> 01:08:13,015
Oh, you idiots.

1669
01:08:13,017 --> 01:08:15,217
OK. You better hope
and pray

1670
01:08:15,219 --> 01:08:16,418
that the celtics win,

1671
01:08:16,420 --> 01:08:18,420
or you're gonna write
a big check.

1672
01:08:18,422 --> 01:08:20,722
Hey, this isn't bad.

1673
01:08:20,724 --> 01:08:23,725
This could be
worth something later,

1674
01:08:23,727 --> 01:08:26,127
in a few years, because
it represents an event

1675
01:08:26,129 --> 01:08:28,362
that might not happen.

1676
01:08:28,364 --> 01:08:30,197
Announcer: At center...
[Crowd booing]

1677
01:08:30,199 --> 01:08:32,799
In his second big year
from Croatia...

1678
01:08:32,801 --> 01:08:34,433
Come on, let's go!
Let's go!

1679
01:08:34,435 --> 01:08:36,301
At 7 feet tall,

1680
01:08:36,303 --> 01:08:38,303
number 71,

ilyalurtz bronfermakher.

1682
01:08:42,242 --> 01:08:45,209
They love me, man.
They really love me!

1683
01:08:45,211 --> 01:08:47,711
No, they're cheering
because Lewis isn't playing

1684
01:08:47,713 --> 01:08:49,345
and they're gonna win.

1685
01:08:49,347 --> 01:08:51,180
But why do you have
to ruin this for me?

1686
01:08:51,182 --> 01:08:54,183
Announcer: Your fabulous
Boston celtics!

1687
01:08:54,185 --> 01:08:56,418
At guard, in his fourth year,

1688
01:08:56,420 --> 01:08:59,421
from Kentucky, at 6'3",

1689
01:08:59,423 --> 01:09:01,356

[Crowd boos]

1691
01:09:07,129 --> 01:09:08,495
Hey, Lewis! Heh.

1692
01:09:10,365 --> 01:09:11,731
All right, lookin' good!

1693
01:09:11,733 --> 01:09:15,201
Lookin' very fresh!
Very rested. Go jazz!

1694
01:09:16,404 --> 01:09:18,170
Hey, coach.

1695
01:09:18,172 --> 01:09:20,756
Coach: Lewis is here.

1696
01:09:20,757 --> 01:09:23,341
Lewis, hi. Hi.
This is the seventh game.

1697
01:09:23,343 --> 01:09:25,409
I can exp...
do you have idea

1698
01:09:25,411 --> 01:09:26,476
what you put us through?!

1699
01:09:26,478 --> 01:09:28,828
Coach, you're not
gonna believe...

1700
01:09:28,829 --> 01:09:31,179
[laughs]. What the hell
is the matter with you,
Lewis?

1701
01:09:31,182 --> 01:09:33,749
Why do you do this to me?
You're selfish, Lewis,

1702
01:09:33,751 --> 01:09:36,184
and that kind of behavior
is unexcusable!

1703
01:09:36,186 --> 01:09:38,819
I'm gonna sit your ass
down on the bench!

1704
01:09:38,821 --> 01:09:40,287
I'm benchin' you, Lewis!

1705
01:09:40,289 --> 01:09:41,855
You can't bench me.
That's right, you're benched!

1706
01:09:41,857 --> 01:09:44,357
I don't want to hear
another word out of you!
Sit down!

1707
01:09:45,827 --> 01:09:47,827
All right, bring it in.
Come on, huddle up!

1708
01:09:47,829 --> 01:09:49,161
This is it, boys.

1709
01:09:49,163 --> 01:09:50,395
2, 3, jazz!

1710
01:09:50,397 --> 01:09:51,763
Kimball! Jeez!

1711
01:09:51,765 --> 01:09:53,097
Kimball:
All right, let's go!

1712
01:09:53,099 --> 01:09:54,331
What are you doin'?!
Put him in!

1713
01:09:54,333 --> 01:09:57,233
Messin' with me, huh?
Huh? I'll show you!

1714
01:09:57,235 --> 01:09:59,568
Kimball, you're blowin' it!

1715
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,269
You don't like it, do you?!

1716
01:10:01,271 --> 01:10:04,105
Doesn't feel good,
does it, Lewis?!

1717
01:10:04,107 --> 01:10:05,806
It's a little payback for you!

1718
01:10:05,808 --> 01:10:07,707
Kimball, don't be an idiot!

1719
01:10:07,709 --> 01:10:09,108
Put the best shooter in the...

1720
01:10:09,110 --> 01:10:10,242
shut up!
You shut up!

1721
01:10:10,244 --> 01:10:12,143
Just shut up!
You shut up!

1722
01:10:12,145 --> 01:10:14,445
Shut up,
the both of you!
I'm sick of it!

1723
01:10:14,447 --> 01:10:15,779
Just shut up!

1724
01:10:15,781 --> 01:10:18,815
Crowd: Here we go, celtics,
here we go.

1725
01:10:18,817 --> 01:10:21,117
Shut up!

1726
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:24,237
All right,

1727
01:10:24,238 --> 01:10:26,155
you've suffered long enough.
Now get in there,
and let's win this one!

1728
01:10:26,157 --> 01:10:27,422
Come on, Lewis!

1729
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:29,223
Let's go! Let's go!

1730
01:10:29,225 --> 01:10:31,291
All right, Lewis!
Scott-power!

1731
01:10:31,293 --> 01:10:35,361
Kimball: Oh, man, sometimes
you just gotta be tough
with these guys.

1732
01:10:35,363 --> 01:10:37,396
Lurch!

1733
01:10:37,398 --> 01:10:39,197
Come here. Heh heh.

1734
01:10:39,199 --> 01:10:41,532
Put the good stuff down
on the bench, son.

1735
01:10:41,534 --> 01:10:42,799
I feel you, coach.

1736
01:10:42,801 --> 01:10:45,334
Yeah, feel the bench,
all right?

1737
01:10:45,336 --> 01:10:46,802
Yellow, purple,
green and white,

1738
01:10:46,804 --> 01:10:49,538
the jazz are
gonna win tonight.
[Chuckles]

1739
01:10:49,540 --> 01:10:51,239
Shut it.

1740
01:11:04,553 --> 01:11:06,419
Yay, Lewis!

1741
01:11:10,324 --> 01:11:13,224
Whoa, Lewis Scott
can't seem to find
his rhythm.

1742
01:11:13,226 --> 01:11:16,293
I guess that's
the price you pay
for skipping practice.

1743
01:11:16,295 --> 01:11:19,330
Marv, it's coming
back to haunt him
right where it hurts.

1744
01:11:19,332 --> 01:11:21,298
Yay, Lewis.

1745
01:11:21,300 --> 01:11:22,899
Go get 'em.

1746
01:11:22,901 --> 01:11:25,601
Jazz, jazz, jazz.

1747
01:11:27,905 --> 01:11:29,471
[Crowd boos]

1748
01:11:31,641 --> 01:11:34,008
You guys are truly devoted.

1749
01:11:34,010 --> 01:11:36,910
There must be green blood
pumping through those veins.

1750
01:11:36,912 --> 01:11:38,544
Mm-hmm.

1751
01:11:43,484 --> 01:11:46,518
Marv, the celtics are really
playing a physical brand
of ball tonight.

1752
01:11:46,520 --> 01:11:48,620
They're just beating up
on the Utah jazz.

1753
01:11:48,622 --> 01:11:51,289
Give him some help!
Give him some help!
Switch!

1754
01:11:52,659 --> 01:11:55,593
Prison won't be so bad.

1755
01:11:55,595 --> 01:11:58,529
I can become
a born-again Christian.

1756
01:11:58,531 --> 01:12:00,397
And that'll be good

1757
01:12:00,399 --> 01:12:04,534
because nobody wants
a born-again Christian
as their bitch.

1758
01:12:04,536 --> 01:12:05,601
Yes!

1759
01:12:05,603 --> 01:12:07,402
Yeah!

1760
01:12:07,404 --> 01:12:09,504
Jesus loves you.

Move your ass.
You're blockin' my view!

1762
01:12:11,307 --> 01:12:12,639
I'm trying
to spread the gospel.

1763
01:12:12,641 --> 01:12:14,474
Yeah? Then spread this.

1764
01:12:14,476 --> 01:12:17,543
Thou shalt not ruin
the frickin' game
for me, OK?!

You've got to do it, Jimmy!

Jimmy, listen, listen,

1785
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:10,418
how long have we been
comin' to this place?

1786
01:13:10,420 --> 01:13:12,236
Since we were 9.

1787
01:13:12,237 --> 01:13:14,053
That's right, and it all
comes down to this!

In the garden...

1792
01:13:23,030 --> 01:13:24,963
At the finals!

1793
01:13:24,965 --> 01:13:28,533
In a couple of weeks,
this place is gonna be
nothin' but rubble!

1794
01:13:28,535 --> 01:13:31,435
Jimmy, this is your destiny.

1795
01:13:31,437 --> 01:13:33,637
Thank you.

Take your best shot now, pal.

1802

I don't want you
to take it from me.

Jimmy: Hey, Mikey,

1813
01:14:46,433 --> 01:14:48,867
100,000 bucks can buy us
a pretty good lawyer!

1814
01:14:48,869 --> 01:14:50,602
No way. It's over.
We're dead.

1815
01:14:50,604 --> 01:14:51,836
Don't talk like that.

1816
01:14:51,838 --> 01:14:53,838
Scott's never gonna wake up.

1817
01:14:53,839 --> 01:14:55,839
We might as well
turn ourselves in now.
Maybe they'll go easy on us.

1818
01:14:55,842 --> 01:14:56,941
Look, would you be quiet?

1819
01:14:56,943 --> 01:14:58,809
I'm gettin' tired
of your negativity.

1820
01:14:58,811 --> 01:15:01,044
Well, I think I have
a right to be negative.
We're goin' to jail!

goin' to jail.

'Cause I'm goin' to jail alone.

1825
01:15:08,485 --> 01:15:10,485
I'm gonna say
I'm the one
who did it.

1826
01:15:10,487 --> 01:15:12,854
I kidnapped Scott,
and that's it.

1827
01:15:12,856 --> 01:15:14,055
What are you sayin'?

1828
01:15:14,057 --> 01:15:17,191
I'm sayin' you have
a wife and a kid.

If somebody gets caught,

well,
it's gonna be me.
I'll take the fall.

1831
01:15:23,665 --> 01:15:28,067
No way. If we get caught,
we're goin' down together.

1832

when you're liftin' weights
in the yard.

The only man
more surprised than me

1871
01:17:09,916 --> 01:17:12,950
was Shepherd, who took
a nasty cut to the ear.

he'll wear an earguard
as well, Marv.
