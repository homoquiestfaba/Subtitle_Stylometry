were in working order,

245

however, the readout
did indicate that there was

246
00:12:28,924 --> 00:12:31,510
a core malfunction,

So there's nothing you can do?

Oh, there's a couple things
we can do here.

249
00:12:35,723 --> 00:12:38,559
Um, we can have him recycled
at Brothers &amp; Sisters.

250

Uh, if you do so before
he begins to decompose,

251
00:12:41,729 --> 00:12:44,565
you'll get $1,000 off on
a new model, which is great.

to have him recycled,

um, we are equipped

box into a virtual assistant,

the taste of tea?

712
00:46:11,864 --> 00:46:14,617
YANG: Maybe. Is the taste
why you like tea?

713
00:46:17,119 --> 00:46:18,662

to do with it.

714

given your life to tea?

715

716
00:46:23,459 --> 00:46:26,253
well, that sounds
pretty serious.

717

Is it not serious?

718
00:46:31,341 --> 00:46:33,426
I guess I've acquired
a taste for tea.

719
00:46:35,095 --> 00:46:37,139
But it's not why
I became interested.

720
00:46:39,850 --> 00:46:41,018
Interested.

721
00:46:42,102 --> 00:46:43,228

really drawn to

722
00:46:43,311 --> 00:46:44,312

723

I think what
I was really drawn to

724
00:46:45,481 --> 00:46:46,982
at the beginning
was the idea of tea.

725
00:46:47,065 --> 00:46:48,066
The idea of tea.

726
00:46:48,150 --> 00:46:50,027
The idea of tea.

727
00:46:50,110 --> 00:46:51,570
Yeah, I saw
this old documentary

728
00:46:51,654 --> 00:46:52,863
when I was in college.

729
00:46:52,946 --> 00:46:55,991
It was from the 20th century.

730
00:46:56,074 --> 00:46:57,451
And it was about this man

731
00:46:57,535 --> 00:46:58,786
<i>searching for the best tea
in China.</i>

732
00:46:58,869 --> 00:47:01,580
It's about a man searching
for the best tea in China.

733
00:47:01,664 --> 00:47:02,915
China is where tea started.

734
00:47:02,998 --> 00:47:03,999
Yes, I'm sure you have

735
00:47:04,082 --> 00:47:06,209
lots of interesting facts
about tea in China.

736
00:47:06,293 --> 00:47:07,294
I do.

737
00:47:07,377 --> 00:47:09,046
Would you like
to hear some of them?

738
00:47:10,422 --> 00:47:11,715
Maybe another time.

739
00:47:13,592 --> 00:47:15,010
I'm sorry, you were saying

740
00:47:15,093 --> 00:47:17,471
about the man
searching for tea.

741
00:47:17,555 --> 00:47:18,764
Yeah. Yeah.

742
00:47:20,057 --> 00:47:21,559
Yeah, actually,
I think that's it.

743
00:47:21,642 --> 00:47:23,686
I think it was his searching
that compelled me.

744
00:47:24,937 --> 00:47:26,814
You know, the pursuit
of this illusive thing,

745
00:47:26,897 --> 00:47:30,358
this process that was
connected to the soil,

746
00:47:30,442 --> 00:47:34,905
to the plants, to the weather,
and to a way of life.

747
00:47:36,364 --> 00:47:37,449
To a way of life.

748
00:47:39,284 --> 00:47:41,203
So that's what
you like about tea?

749
00:47:42,746 --> 00:47:46,792
The search,
not so much the taste.

750
00:47:46,875 --> 00:47:48,376
No, no, no, the taste, too.

751

(LAUGHING) There's this, uh...

752
00:47:56,469 --> 00:47:58,303
There's this part in the film,

753
00:47:58,386 --> 00:47:59,805
it's a great part,
where the man

754
00:47:59,888 --> 00:48:01,807
is explaining
to his German friend

755
00:48:02,725 --> 00:48:05,185
why it's so difficult for him
to describe the taste of tea.

756
00:48:05,268 --> 00:48:07,646
He says,
"There's no language for it.

757
00:48:07,730 --> 00:48:10,107
"There are no words
to adequately express

758
