1
00:00:36,750 --> 00:00:39,218
I always wanted to be
in the movies

2
00:00:40,454 --> 00:00:46,415
When I was little I thought for sure
1 day, I could be a big big star...

3
00:00:46,593 --> 00:00:48,686
Or maybe just beautiful...

4
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:52,262
Beautiful and rich,
like the women on TV

5
00:00:53,033 --> 00:00:55,558
Yeah, I had a lot of dreams

6
00:00:55,702 --> 00:00:58,193
And I guess you can
call me a real romantic

7
00:00:58,338 --> 00:01:02,035
Because I truly believe that
one day... they'll come true

8
00:01:02,409 --> 00:01:04,934
So I dream about it for hours

9
00:01:05,112 --> 00:01:08,782
As the years went by,
I learnt to stop sharing this with people

10
00:01:08,817 --> 00:01:10,374
They said I was dreaming

11
00:01:10,484 --> 00:01:14,215
But back then, I believed
it whole heartily

12
00:01:14,488 --> 00:01:18,015
So whenever I was down,
I would just escape into my mind

13
00:01:18,358 --> 00:01:21,384
To my other live, where
I was someone else

14
00:01:21,561 --> 00:01:23,756
It made me happy to think
that all these people...

15
00:01:23,897 --> 00:01:26,297
just didn't know yet
who I was gonna be

16
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,230
But 1 day they'll all see

17
00:01:29,469 --> 00:01:32,370
I heard that Marilyn Monroe
was discovered in a soda shop

18
00:01:32,406 --> 00:01:34,601
And I thought for sure,
it could be like that

19
00:01:34,775 --> 00:01:36,640
So I started growing up
real young...

20
00:01:36,843 --> 00:01:40,904
And I always secretly looking
for who is gonna discover me?

21
00:01:41,047 --> 00:01:42,878
Was it this guy?

22
00:01:45,385 --> 00:01:46,909
Or maybe this one?

23
00:01:47,587 --> 00:01:49,054
You never knew

24
00:01:49,923 --> 00:01:53,381
But even if they couldn't take me
all the way... like Marilyn

25
00:01:53,493 --> 00:01:56,223
They would somehow
believe in me just enough

26
00:01:56,329 --> 00:02:01,460
They would see me for what I could
be, and think I was beautiful

27
00:02:03,537 --> 00:02:05,732
Like a diamond in the rough

28
00:02:06,807 --> 00:02:08,798
They'll take me away...

29
00:02:08,909 --> 00:02:10,467
To my new life

30
00:02:10,677 --> 00:02:12,736
And my new world

31
00:02:12,879 --> 00:02:15,006
Where everything
would be different

32
00:02:18,552 --> 00:02:23,888
Yeah, I lived that way
for long long time

33
00:02:24,124 --> 00:02:27,890
And my head dreaming
like that

34
00:02:27,961 --> 00:02:29,553
It was nice

35
00:02:29,729 --> 00:02:31,594
1 day it just stopped

36
00:02:50,550 --> 00:02:52,609
By the time I met
you all...

37
00:02:53,019 --> 00:02:56,455
Shame...
all I want is a beer

38
00:03:12,472 --> 00:03:14,463
How are you doing?
- Great

39
00:03:14,508 --> 00:03:15,634
Anyone sitting here?

40
00:03:15,742 --> 00:03:17,209
No

41
00:03:39,432 --> 00:03:42,401
Madam our services
are for patrons only

42
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,503
Give me a beer
whatever cheapest

43
00:03:50,544 --> 00:03:53,411
So what it is like,
a gay place or what?

44
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,409
Yeah

45
00:03:57,017 --> 00:03:58,609
Hey, whatever, man

46
00:04:21,808 --> 00:04:23,742
Can I buy you that drink?

47
00:04:23,877 --> 00:04:25,640
I got my own money

48
00:04:28,615 --> 00:04:32,016
I'll have a pitcher, whatever
she's having

49
00:04:34,087 --> 00:04:35,987
Look, I'm not gay alrite?

50
00:04:37,791 --> 00:04:39,554
Well, it makes sense

51
00:04:39,593 --> 00:04:40,958
So what are you doing
here then?

52
00:04:41,127 --> 00:04:43,027
My truck broke down, I'm a...

53
00:04:44,564 --> 00:04:46,657
I got a pressure cleaning
business

54
00:04:46,766 --> 00:04:48,165
What's pressure cleaning?

55
00:04:48,335 --> 00:04:50,132
You know steam clean?

56
00:04:50,570 --> 00:04:52,037
Upholstery, carpets,
you know, shit like that

57
00:04:53,573 --> 00:04:56,064
So I'm just getting out of the rain

58
00:04:56,810 --> 00:04:58,835
My name is Selby

59
00:05:05,585 --> 00:05:06,984
You owe me change!

60
00:05:09,322 --> 00:05:13,656
Fuck!
I'm out of here

61
00:05:13,693 --> 00:05:14,591
Oh, are you sure?

62
00:05:14,961 --> 00:05:17,225
Get your fucking hands off
me! you dumb dyke...

63
00:05:17,330 --> 00:05:18,922
I'm not gonna fuck you
for fucking beer ok

64
00:05:19,032 --> 00:05:21,626
Stop wasting your fucking
time!

65
00:05:21,701 --> 00:05:23,498
I wasn't trying to fuck
you!

66
00:05:23,670 --> 00:05:24,898
I just wanna talk to you

67
00:05:25,038 --> 00:05:28,599
I thought that if I bought you
some beer maybe you'll talk to me

68
00:05:29,342 --> 00:05:31,902
I just trying to have one
decent night out, you know..

69
00:05:32,879 --> 00:05:36,940
Just talk to someone before
I've to go back to my parents closet

70
00:05:37,283 --> 00:05:39,046
I'm sorry

71
00:05:48,928 --> 00:05:50,156
You don't have to stay

72
00:05:55,769 --> 00:05:58,169
So are you really a
steam cleaner?

73
00:05:58,938 --> 00:06:00,633
No, I'm not

74
00:06:02,809 --> 00:06:05,175
No man, actually it's
a real good job...

75
00:06:05,345 --> 00:06:07,643
Pressure cleaning

76
00:06:10,483 --> 00:06:12,644
You want some?

77
00:06:20,894 --> 00:06:22,691
Oh come on don't
let me down now

78
00:06:22,962 --> 00:06:24,190
You ready?

79
00:06:24,264 --> 00:06:26,858
1... no, you don't get
to do this

80
00:06:26,966 --> 00:06:28,558
Shit, I don't fucking
trust you

81
00:06:28,668 --> 00:06:29,828
You ready?

82
00:06:30,303 --> 00:06:32,931
1, 2, go!

83
00:06:39,379 --> 00:06:40,437
You do suck

84
00:06:40,580 --> 00:06:42,275
You're just a sore winner

85
00:06:42,415 --> 00:06:43,848
Yeah, winner though,
man

86
00:06:43,950 --> 00:06:45,815
Oh, man that's all
my cast

87
00:06:45,985 --> 00:06:47,850
You spilled some good
shit there

88
00:06:47,987 --> 00:06:49,454
I'm gonna lick it up
like a dog

89
00:06:49,589 --> 00:06:51,284
We need 2 more

90
00:06:52,859 --> 00:06:54,728
What's that bullshit?

91
00:06:54,763 --> 00:06:55,524
What time is it?

92
00:06:55,628 --> 00:06:57,892
The bar is closed

93
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:02,159
Then why don't you take
that stick out of your ass...

94
00:07:02,335 --> 00:07:04,098
Now would be a good time,
don't you think huh?

95
00:07:04,237 --> 00:07:06,228
Now that the bar's closed

96
00:07:09,876 --> 00:07:12,367
What you do for is that?

97
00:07:17,250 --> 00:07:18,308
We had a good time
though

98
00:07:18,485 --> 00:07:21,181
Yeah, I know, it was fun

99
00:07:21,287 --> 00:07:23,084
I'm sorry, I called you
dumb dyke

100
00:07:23,890 --> 00:07:25,653
I don't care

101
00:07:27,460 --> 00:07:29,087
And thanks for the drinks

102
00:07:30,230 --> 00:07:31,857
No... No Problem.

103
00:07:32,232 --> 00:07:33,460
So see you around ok

104
00:07:33,566 --> 00:07:35,056
Do you wanna stay with
me?

105
00:07:35,735 --> 00:07:38,966
I didn't mean... you know
you don't have to do anything

106
00:07:39,205 --> 00:07:40,934
Shit I know

107
00:07:45,779 --> 00:07:46,677
Fuck it

108
00:07:46,946 --> 00:07:49,608
Yeah? My truck's
broken down

109
00:07:50,617 --> 00:07:55,111
Ok, car's over here,
come here, this way

110
00:07:58,124 --> 00:08:00,092
All I wanted was a beer

111
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:04,423
But the day I met Selby I'd spent most of the
afternoon sitting in the rain, about to kill myself

112
00:08:04,631 --> 00:08:05,825
So you can understand

113
00:08:05,932 --> 00:08:10,301
I was flexible, I mean everybody
gotta have faith in something

114
00:08:10,436 --> 00:08:13,530
For me? For me all I had left
was love

115
00:08:13,673 --> 00:08:15,868
And I was getting pretty sure that,
I wasn't gonna love a man again

116
00:08:16,042 --> 00:08:17,475
So I was gonna do it

117
00:08:17,777 --> 00:08:20,644
And the only reason I did it
was a five dollar bill

118
00:08:20,847 --> 00:08:23,441
I knew I probably given some
asshole a blowjob for it

119
00:08:23,650 --> 00:08:27,484
So really tried to piss me off that
if I killed myself without spending it

120
00:08:27,654 --> 00:08:29,884
Basically I sucked
him off for free

121
00:08:30,023 --> 00:08:31,547
So I made a deal

122
00:08:31,691 --> 00:08:33,989
I said God, I gotta spend
this 5 bucks

123
00:08:34,127 --> 00:08:35,788
But when it's gone
so am I

124
00:08:36,930 --> 00:08:40,331
If you've got something for me
in this life, you better bring it on

125
00:08:40,800 --> 00:08:42,563
And there she was

126
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:49,673
Just some friends my parents
and I are staying with

127
00:08:53,746 --> 00:08:56,146
You wanna take a shower
or anything?

128
00:09:23,877 --> 00:09:26,846
Goodnite
- Goodnite

129
00:09:47,267 --> 00:09:49,235
I can't believe you
are here

130
00:09:51,237 --> 00:09:52,704
Me neither

131
00:09:59,012 --> 00:10:01,105
Can I touch your face?

132
00:10:07,754 --> 00:10:09,449
Sure

133
00:10:38,418 --> 00:10:39,578
Honey!

134
00:10:42,255 --> 00:10:46,419
God Donna!
Donna sorry, just a sec!

135
00:10:49,362 --> 00:10:51,796
I'm sorry, I'm supposed
to be ready for church

136
00:10:53,866 --> 00:10:55,356
Hey, where's my shirt?

137
00:10:58,438 --> 00:11:02,067
Look at this, it's 5 o'clock in
the morning and she ain't dressed yet

138
00:11:05,445 --> 00:11:06,946
I'm sorry about that

139
00:11:06,981 --> 00:11:08,311
No, it's alrite

140
00:11:08,514 --> 00:11:10,175
Hey thanks for letting me crash

141
00:11:10,650 --> 00:11:12,015
No, that was nice

142
00:11:17,790 --> 00:11:19,382
So when are you leaving?

143
00:11:19,492 --> 00:11:20,823
Tuesday

144
00:11:20,994 --> 00:11:25,328
But you know, I'm gonna be hanging out
at the Moon Nite, around 5

145
00:11:26,366 --> 00:11:28,857
About 2 blocks up
- Yeah yeah yeah

146
00:11:29,635 --> 00:11:31,398
Maybe I'll swing by

147
00:11:31,504 --> 00:11:33,472
Alrite

148
00:11:38,077 --> 00:11:40,341
You have fun at church,
alrite

149
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:48,553
Who was that person?

150
00:11:49,055 --> 00:11:51,023
She's just a friend I made

151
00:11:51,157 --> 00:11:54,126
Honey, I think she was a
straight person

152
00:11:54,527 --> 00:11:57,519
Did you check your stuff,
because she might have stole something

153
00:11:57,630 --> 00:12:02,294
No... I checked it, she didn't
take anything

154
00:12:02,468 --> 00:12:07,929
Listen, honey, you cannot bring people
like that here, what if Charles had seen her?

155
00:12:08,508 --> 00:12:09,907
I'm sorry

156
00:12:10,043 --> 00:12:13,535
A person like that... no Mdm

157
00:12:14,113 --> 00:12:16,946
We have no business with
people like that

158
00:12:29,295 --> 00:12:31,229
I'm just getting some stuff

159
00:12:31,631 --> 00:12:33,792
You'll give it to me when you get it

160
00:12:36,402 --> 00:12:37,926
Want some sandwich?

161
00:12:38,604 --> 00:12:41,630
Ham don't do it for me
- Thanks, man

162
00:12:45,645 --> 00:12:47,237

163
00:12:47,547 --> 00:12:49,208
It's alrite

164
00:12:50,950 --> 00:12:52,815
You'll pay me when
you get it

165
00:12:52,952 --> 00:12:53,919
How are you doing?

166
00:12:54,087 --> 00:12:55,111
I'm good

167
00:12:57,156 --> 00:12:59,784
I met a friend
- Really? good for you

168
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:02,661
Hope it's not some
asshole like the last guy...

169
00:13:02,762 --> 00:13:04,593
who almost trampled you half to death

170
00:13:04,730 --> 00:13:07,927
No, she is... real nice,

171
00:13:14,707 --> 00:13:16,299
Thanks, man

172
00:13:24,083 --> 00:13:25,516
Hang on a sec

00:13:31,324 --> 00:13:33,121
Hang the fuck on!

174
00:13:54,847 --> 00:13:56,280
You look good

175
00:13:58,017 --> 00:13:59,507
Thanks

176
00:14:10,463 --> 00:14:12,454
Man, you know what
I'm going to give you the $5...

00:14:18,671 --> 00:14:20,400
I got it. I got it

178
00:14:24,177 --> 00:14:25,701
So you came

00:14:25,912 --> 00:14:28,506
Yeah I was around,

180
00:14:33,586 --> 00:14:35,019
So where's your friends?

181
00:14:35,388 --> 00:14:39,791
Well, I... I'm not...

182
00:14:40,459 --> 00:14:41,756
You're mean

183
00:14:46,566 --> 00:14:48,466
Can I ask you a question?

184
00:14:50,937 --> 00:14:53,030
Are you a prostitute?

185
00:14:55,608 --> 00:14:57,166
Yeah

186
00:14:59,712 --> 00:15:01,703
I don't know

187
00:15:02,381 --> 00:15:06,909
People like pay to be
with you, it's wild!

188
00:15:07,386 --> 00:15:10,844
Men must just line up
to be with a girl like you

189
00:15:11,757 --> 00:15:15,193
I guess, I don't know,
not really, you know!

190
00:15:17,430 --> 00:15:18,954
What do you do to them?

191
00:15:19,131 --> 00:15:21,531
All kind of things, you know,
whatever they want

192
00:15:21,634 --> 00:15:22,965
How do you know what
they want?

193
00:15:23,102 --> 00:15:24,535
Well they ain't shy
to tell you

194
00:15:24,704 --> 00:15:25,500
Really?

195
00:15:25,605 --> 00:15:27,197
Well shit, men are real
easy to read anyway

196
00:15:27,373 --> 00:15:29,238
Well, how about that guy?

197
00:15:36,349 --> 00:15:37,680
How about him?

198
00:15:37,783 --> 00:15:39,580
Oh, he's gay

199
00:15:39,719 --> 00:15:40,947
No way

200
00:15:41,120 --> 00:15:43,452
Yeah, man, look at him,
he tries too hard

201
00:15:44,523 --> 00:15:46,718
Oh man you see that
little fucker over there?

202
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:50,727
Well he, he's straight up, S&M

203
00:15:51,931 --> 00:15:55,367
That's Trevor,
That's the son of the people I'm staying with

204
00:15:55,534 --> 00:15:57,001
Shit I'm sorry

205
00:15:57,136 --> 00:15:58,728
I don't care about that

206
00:16:00,273 --> 00:16:02,764
I don't realise he was gonna
be here

207
00:16:10,783 --> 00:16:15,584
This girl in my church, she told
everyone that I tried to kiss her

208
00:16:15,721 --> 00:16:18,019
So my parents
basically disowned me

209
00:16:18,157 --> 00:16:21,752
And I decided to come down here
and try to figure somethings out

210
00:16:21,827 --> 00:16:23,988
Then this happened
before I could get a job

211
00:16:26,032 --> 00:16:28,000
How long do you have to stay on?

212
00:16:28,134 --> 00:16:30,034
Not too much longer

213
00:16:30,403 --> 00:16:33,167
But my dad had to pay my medical bills

214
00:16:33,372 --> 00:16:36,432
So I made a deal with him,
that I would go back

215
00:16:36,609 --> 00:16:42,570
Which... you know... it... probably
for the best... maybe it'll work

216
00:16:42,715 --> 00:16:47,880
Maybe he'll be able to save my
soul and all that

217
00:16:50,589 --> 00:16:54,389
Well I bet you twenty, I'll beat
your ass in a race, rite now

218
00:16:55,127 --> 00:16:56,355
Oh no...

219
00:16:56,495 --> 00:16:58,292
Oh yeah, me and you are gonna
hit the floor rite now

220
00:16:58,431 --> 00:17:01,161
Serious I can't skate

221
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:06,035
You gotta help me

222
00:17:06,172 --> 00:17:07,833
I know, I've gotcha, come on

223
00:17:10,443 --> 00:17:11,740
There you got it

224
00:17:11,844 --> 00:17:13,675
You better not let
me break my other arm

225
00:17:13,846 --> 00:17:15,507
See you can do this

226
00:17:16,082 --> 00:17:17,709
Your're very good, man

227
00:17:18,317 --> 00:17:19,409
You think you can you do by yourself?

228
00:17:19,552 --> 00:17:20,951
Ok
- There you go

229
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:22,446
Feel the music

230
00:17:35,701 --> 00:17:37,328
You having fun?

231
00:17:42,441 --> 00:17:44,875
There you go turn, turn

232
00:17:50,816 --> 00:17:52,784
Oh, man I love this song

233
00:17:52,918 --> 00:17:54,510
Oh I love it too

234
00:17:57,223 --> 00:17:58,247
Just like that

235
00:17:58,491 --> 00:17:59,515
Oh I can't do that

236
00:17:59,692 --> 00:18:00,624
Yeah you can

237
00:18:00,793 --> 00:18:02,886
No, no, no,come on,
come with me

238
00:18:02,962 --> 00:18:04,122
Trevor

239
00:18:04,397 --> 00:18:06,058
Who cares about him?

240
00:18:06,899 --> 00:18:08,799
Come on are you ready?

241
00:18:20,913 --> 00:18:22,881
So we don't hit anyone

242
00:18:25,684 --> 00:18:26,878
Are you ok?

243
00:19:42,862 --> 00:19:44,989
I can't, I can't do
this here

244
00:19:45,130 --> 00:19:46,893
Maybe we can go somewhere

245
00:19:55,608 --> 00:19:57,576
How about the yard
over there?

246
00:20:12,324 --> 00:20:13,882
I thought you didn't like gals

247
00:20:20,332 --> 00:20:22,766
I don't like men anymore,
really

248
00:20:25,037 --> 00:20:26,800
I like you

249
00:20:34,446 --> 00:20:38,906
Maybe... maybe we
could go somewhere

250
00:20:40,052 --> 00:20:42,043
Where we can get
a room or something

251
00:20:43,722 --> 00:20:46,054
Oh I don't have any
money

252
00:21:01,040 --> 00:21:02,632

253
00:21:04,276 --> 00:21:05,937

And some very handsome
young gentlemen, I understand

259

262
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:37,835
It's real hard to get help
around here, you know

263
00:22:38,137 --> 00:22:40,537
I was getting lost

264
00:22:41,206 --> 00:22:42,639
So where are you headed?

265
00:22:42,808 --> 00:22:45,242
Just where you can take me,

266
00:22:45,644 --> 00:22:46,872

00:22:55,688 --> 00:22:57,883
They are down in Miami,

00:22:58,190 --> 00:23:01,387
But I'm kind of broke,

So just trying to make...

00:30:38,950 --> 00:30:41,578
Sorry it was me

324
00:30:41,686 --> 00:30:42,778
You didn't hear nothing?

325
00:30:43,221 --> 00:30:45,849
No, it's me I fell out of bed

326
00:30:53,298 --> 00:30:55,163
If that woman's in here, Selby, so help me god..

327
00:30:57,903 --> 00:31:02,636
I had a talk with Trevor, and I really
don't appreciate what he told me

328
00:31:02,841 --> 00:31:04,968
I don't think your father
will either

329
00:31:06,444 --> 00:31:09,902
If she's in here, I want you
to get her out rite now!

330
00:31:10,782 --> 00:31:13,342
Or Charlie bound to blow
her head off

331
00:31:26,364 --> 00:31:27,626
What the hell are
you doing here?

332
00:31:30,535 --> 00:31:32,867
No man, I just wanted to see you

333
00:31:40,078 --> 00:31:41,773
I got in a fight

334
00:31:42,347 --> 00:31:44,178
It must have been a really long fight

335
00:31:44,316 --> 00:31:47,183
I got a man really
beaten me up, ok

336
00:31:50,488 --> 00:31:52,683
It wasn't my fault

337
00:31:57,262 --> 00:31:59,025
Are you ok?

338
00:32:06,504 --> 00:32:08,267
But it's cool now

339
00:32:08,907 --> 00:32:10,738
It's cool

340
00:32:11,076 --> 00:32:12,771
I was thinking...

341
00:32:13,812 --> 00:32:16,440
You know I want you to
stay a little longer

342
00:32:17,482 --> 00:32:19,317
Cause I can't

343
00:32:19,352 --> 00:32:20,375
Why not?

344
00:32:20,485 --> 00:32:23,147
Cause I told you
I promised my dad

345
00:32:24,656 --> 00:32:29,218
Well, he's your dad rite,
wouldn't he understand

346
00:32:29,261 --> 00:32:32,753
So I'm sure he can save
your soul a week from now, rite?

347
00:32:40,772 --> 00:32:44,230
See, I told you...
no problem rite?

348
00:32:46,578 --> 00:32:49,479
I was goona use it to take you
out tonite, but...

349
00:32:50,248 --> 00:32:53,183
That's enough to rent
a hotel for whole week

350
00:32:53,385 --> 00:32:57,617
We can party, hang out,
whatever you wanna do, you know

351
00:33:01,893 --> 00:33:03,793
Maybe I can come back

352
00:33:07,966 --> 00:33:12,164
No, you can't come back

353
00:33:12,537 --> 00:33:14,630
Cause I'll be gone

354
00:33:23,481 --> 00:33:25,142
Listen to me,

355
00:33:26,584 --> 00:33:29,678
This is a once in a life
time opportunity

356
00:33:30,622 --> 00:33:35,423
Give me a week, I'm gonna go
later I'll buy you fucking ticket

357
00:33:35,560 --> 00:33:38,427
I'll take you there
myself, just give me a week

358
00:33:41,299 --> 00:33:44,029
You'll never meet someone
like me again

359
00:33:53,211 --> 00:33:57,341
Ok
- Alrite

360
00:34:11,396 --> 00:34:13,193
Where did you get this car?

361
00:34:13,465 --> 00:34:15,330
I just borrowed it

362
00:34:58,877 --> 00:35:00,367
So what do we do now?

363
00:35:02,580 --> 00:35:04,377
Whatever?

364
00:35:11,256 --> 00:35:13,486
Cheers
- Cheers

365
00:36:19,090 --> 00:36:20,580
It's getting late

366
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,163
Oh My God Selby!
We thought you were dead

367
00:37:04,335 --> 00:37:05,700
Donna, I'm sorry,
I just came and get some stuff

368
00:37:05,837 --> 00:37:07,828
No, honey, you are gonna
talk to your father

369
00:37:09,774 --> 00:37:11,071
You stand rite here!

370
00:37:11,276 --> 00:37:13,836
John, yes she's back

371
00:37:14,412 --> 00:37:15,879
She's here

372
00:37:16,180 --> 00:37:18,148
Ok, hang on, hang on

373
00:37:18,683 --> 00:37:20,048
Talk to your dad

374
00:37:21,819 --> 00:37:23,218
Hello?

375
00:37:27,158 --> 00:37:30,252
I found a roomate and...

376
00:37:36,200 --> 00:37:37,861
I can't dad

377
00:37:38,036 --> 00:37:40,436
I'm not even staying
here anymore

378
00:37:43,174 --> 00:37:49,079
I just came by to pick up some stuff,
I'm not even staying at Donna's anymore

379
00:37:58,923 --> 00:38:03,417
Ok.. ok.. I'm an adult now,
I'm gonna stay...

380
00:38:04,062 --> 00:38:06,929
And I gotta go

381
00:38:08,199 --> 00:38:09,826
What are you doing?

382
00:38:10,635 --> 00:38:15,334
She's not even... gay

383
00:38:15,473 --> 00:38:19,705
She's just some old street
hooker, she's just using you

384
00:38:28,586 --> 00:38:29,883
I quit

385
00:38:30,455 --> 00:38:31,683
What?

386
00:38:33,257 --> 00:38:34,986
What're your bags doing here?

387
00:38:35,093 --> 00:38:36,617
I'm staying

388
00:38:38,329 --> 00:38:41,594
Holy shit girl, you just
made my day

389
00:38:43,034 --> 00:38:44,331
How did you get them huh?

390
00:38:44,502 --> 00:38:46,231
I took a cab

391
00:38:47,338 --> 00:38:49,363
But Leen, you can take care
of me rite? cause...

392
00:38:49,507 --> 00:38:51,475
I've spent all our money

393
00:38:54,979 --> 00:38:56,640
It don't even matter

394
00:38:56,981 --> 00:38:58,915
What you said?
You quit?

395
00:38:59,083 --> 00:39:01,745
Hooking... I quit hooking

396
00:39:01,919 --> 00:39:03,113
Why?

397
00:39:03,655 --> 00:39:06,749
Why? because it's shit, it's time man,
I fucking hate it

398
00:39:07,191 --> 00:39:08,681
I thought you said
it wasn't that bad

399
00:39:08,826 --> 00:39:12,091
Oh.. it is, you know, but,
not always, it's not the point

400
00:39:12,230 --> 00:39:13,925
I got you now

401
00:39:14,132 --> 00:39:16,225
I got everything going for me

402
00:39:17,068 --> 00:39:18,626
So I'm gonna do a broil

403
00:39:18,770 --> 00:39:21,136
This time I'm doing
it a broil

404
00:39:21,205 --> 00:39:22,331
How about that?

405
00:39:22,640 --> 00:39:25,336
Fine, but what are you
gonna do about work?

406
00:39:25,643 --> 00:39:28,407
Exactly... I'll get a job

407
00:39:28,546 --> 00:39:33,176
Go clean... straighten up, you know,
fuck it, man, I'll get a career

408
00:39:33,985 --> 00:39:39,252
House, car... you know,
how about that

409
00:39:40,758 --> 00:39:43,124
What kind of job are
you gonna get?

410
00:39:43,428 --> 00:39:45,589
I've been thinking
about that

411
00:39:46,831 --> 00:39:49,231
I was thinking maybe like
a veterinarian, you know

412
00:39:49,367 --> 00:39:51,335
Cos I fucking love animals,
you know

413
00:39:51,436 --> 00:39:53,028
Yeah...

414
00:39:53,304 --> 00:39:57,434
But that's a doctor...
you gotta get a degree for that

415
00:39:58,409 --> 00:40:02,869
No, I'm not, no

416
00:40:03,748 --> 00:40:07,616
Shit, I know, you know
what I always wanted to be?

417
00:40:07,752 --> 00:40:09,219
What?

418
00:40:09,320 --> 00:40:11,754
President of the US

419
00:40:27,405 --> 00:40:30,238
I just haven't been feeling too good
lately, you know

420
00:40:33,745 --> 00:40:35,372
But I will though, man

421
00:40:36,047 --> 00:40:37,844
I'll be feeling great

422
00:40:42,120 --> 00:40:45,578
It's fucking
celebration time

423
00:40:46,457 --> 00:40:50,018
Oh yes this is...
this is big

424
00:40:50,161 --> 00:40:53,392
I once heard this thing that
always stuck with me

425
00:40:53,731 --> 00:40:54,959
I must've been around
13 years old

426
00:40:55,133 --> 00:40:58,330
Cause I remember I just
put the baby up for adoption

427
00:40:58,503 --> 00:41:00,494
They call the assembly
of my junior high

428
00:41:00,638 --> 00:41:02,765
Cause this guy who played
drum for certain workmen...

429
00:41:02,974 --> 00:41:04,737
Was coming to talk to
us about success...

430
00:41:04,876 --> 00:41:07,242
and making your mark
on the world

431
00:41:07,645 --> 00:41:11,103
I don't have any experience,
per se...

432
00:41:11,249 --> 00:41:14,514
I'm a real... I mean
I'm a reaI hard worker

433
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:17,882
I was real excited, cause he was
the 1st real celebrity I've seen...

434
00:41:18,156 --> 00:41:19,953
And this was exactly the
kind of thing I wanted to learn...

435
00:41:20,057 --> 00:41:21,854
How to follow in the
footsteps of...

436
00:41:22,059 --> 00:41:23,219
I don't even write it
down, you know

437
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:24,988
Just stay rite...
just stay rite there

438
00:41:25,196 --> 00:41:28,427
And you should know that
I've worked with people all my life

439
00:41:28,766 --> 00:41:31,462
So I'm real good with
people and...

440
00:41:32,403 --> 00:41:34,803
I know how to work the roledex

441
00:41:35,006 --> 00:41:36,667
So I listen real hard to any advice he had

442
00:41:38,209 --> 00:41:41,645
For sure he said something
that stuck rite in my real mind

443
00:41:41,779 --> 00:41:44,942
It was all you need in
life... is love

444
00:41:45,082 --> 00:41:46,481
And to believe in
yourself

445
00:41:46,784 --> 00:41:48,718
then there's nothing you can't do

446
00:41:51,656 --> 00:41:53,920
To make sure that i have all
this straight

447
00:41:54,091 --> 00:41:57,492
Basically, you've no experience,
no college degree...

448
00:41:57,628 --> 00:42:00,392
No resume, no work history
what-so-ever in fact

449
00:42:00,531 --> 00:42:02,965
And now you would
like to be... a lawyer

450
00:42:03,568 --> 00:42:07,334
No, see... I'm sorry,
but when I read the ad...

451
00:42:07,471 --> 00:42:09,336
It said you were looking
for a secretary

452
00:42:09,440 --> 00:42:12,204
Ok, well you need to
learn how to type...

453
00:42:12,343 --> 00:42:13,935
You'll need computer skills

454
00:42:14,078 --> 00:42:15,875
Most of our secretaries
have college degree

455
00:42:15,980 --> 00:42:19,040
Infact most of them have
specialised in law

456
00:42:19,183 --> 00:42:23,711
I don't mean to sound harsh, but
frankly this is a little insulting

457
00:42:26,157 --> 00:42:27,920
All that looks great,
It must be wonderful, but...

458
00:42:28,059 --> 00:42:29,356
Can I tell you something?

459
00:42:29,527 --> 00:42:33,088
When the beach party is over, you
don't get to say, you know what

460
00:42:33,264 --> 00:42:36,324
I think now I would like to have what everybody
else has worked their entire life for...

461
00:42:36,434 --> 00:42:38,026
It doesn't work that way

462
00:42:38,970 --> 00:42:40,835
Fuck you, man!

463
00:42:41,005 --> 00:42:42,336
Yeah fuck you!

464
00:42:42,440 --> 00:42:44,374
You don't fucking
know me

465
00:42:44,475 --> 00:42:46,568
Ok, great, that's great, see?

466
00:42:46,711 --> 00:42:51,478
Now I'm so sorry I didn't hire you before.
Leslie could you please escort miss...

467
00:42:51,582 --> 00:42:54,346
I don't even know her name, because of course
she doesn't have a resume...

468
00:42:54,452 --> 00:42:56,977
No need, you fucking asshole,
you piece of shit

469
00:42:57,121 --> 00:42:59,055
What you think I'm
fucking retard?

470
00:43:00,224 --> 00:43:01,691
Take your fucking job and fucking shove it!

471
00:43:02,894 --> 00:43:04,987
Fuck you Leslie!

472
00:43:05,596 --> 00:43:09,396
All I need is love and to
believe in yourself

473
00:43:09,867 --> 00:43:14,099
Nice idea, it doesn't exactly
work out that way

474
00:43:14,238 --> 00:43:18,231
But I guess it was better to hear
flat out lying then to know the truth at thirteen

475
00:43:22,146 --> 00:43:26,412
Fuck this phoney shit, told him to fuck himself,
kiss my fucking sweet ass

476
00:43:26,984 --> 00:43:29,646
Slamped me out of the fucking
door, just like that, man

477
00:43:30,288 --> 00:43:31,755
What did he do?

478
00:43:33,424 --> 00:43:34,914
Not a fucking thing

479
00:43:35,426 --> 00:43:37,792
Not one fucking thing

480
00:43:37,995 --> 00:43:38,927
Stupid mother fucker

481
00:43:39,096 --> 00:43:41,656
I've bet nobody fucking ever talked
to him like that in his whole life

482
00:43:41,799 --> 00:43:44,962
Fucking office job, who the
fuck wants a job like that

483
00:43:45,102 --> 00:43:46,437
You gotta fucking sitting
in a little desk...

484
00:43:46,472 --> 00:43:47,369
You got your little phone...

485
00:43:47,505 --> 00:43:49,302
You got your piece of paper,
your little pen...

486
00:43:49,440 --> 00:43:51,169
You write shit down,
bla bla bla

487
00:43:51,242 --> 00:43:54,439
Fucking a monkey can
do that shit, man, fuck!

488
00:43:54,745 --> 00:43:56,440
I thought you wanted a
job like that

489
00:43:56,580 --> 00:43:58,172
You know what?

490
00:43:58,349 --> 00:44:00,510
No. Toby, 2 more

491
00:44:01,385 --> 00:44:04,354
Honey, Al says I can't give you
any tab

492
00:44:04,455 --> 00:44:07,071
Toby, how long have I
been the customer here?

493
00:44:07,106 --> 00:44:09,688
Would you cut me some
fucking slack here?

494
00:44:11,095 --> 00:44:13,120
Go get me 2 more

495
00:44:14,932 --> 00:44:18,595
Fucking lazy bastard,
it's no big deal, man

496
00:44:18,769 --> 00:44:21,260
Al runs a tab all the time
you know...

497
00:44:21,405 --> 00:44:23,305
he just probably doesn't
know it

498
00:44:23,441 --> 00:44:26,376
Leen, what are you
gonna do?

499
00:44:26,510 --> 00:44:28,842
I got it on fucking
control, man

500
00:44:32,583 --> 00:44:35,074
I'm kind of starving here

501
00:44:39,423 --> 00:44:42,392
There's no way, you could
maybe ah...

502
00:44:43,394 --> 00:44:45,555
I don't know, call your
dad or...

503
00:44:46,197 --> 00:44:52,261
Yeah I know I know,
I'm just saying for you, you know?

504
00:44:54,338 --> 00:44:57,501
Fuck it, man, I got shit
line up, you know

505
00:44:58,642 --> 00:45:00,872
It's not a fucking big deal

506
00:45:04,348 --> 00:45:06,475
Can I just give it to
you straight

507
00:45:07,551 --> 00:45:10,213
The truth is,
I'm... I'm a hooker

508
00:45:10,488 --> 00:45:12,547
I'm trying to clean my life up
here, you know...

509
00:45:12,723 --> 00:45:14,987
Go straight and questions
and all, so...

510
00:45:15,126 --> 00:45:18,152
If there's any link that you
can help me with...

511
00:45:21,365 --> 00:45:23,333
That's because I was...
- That's not even matter gonna matter

512
00:45:23,501 --> 00:45:24,535
Because the best you're gonna get is
factory work

513
00:45:24,570 --> 00:45:27,197
Hey Todd, do we even have any
factory work?

514
00:45:27,671 --> 00:45:29,161
Fuck!

515
00:45:29,540 --> 00:45:32,407
I'm sorry, I'm just trying
to talk to you here...

516
00:45:38,883 --> 00:45:41,044
You don't have any
change, do you?

517
00:46:01,172 --> 00:46:04,039
Madam, I'm afraid I've to
ask you to come with me

518
00:46:04,275 --> 00:46:05,537
Why?

519
00:46:05,776 --> 00:46:07,767
Well we've had some complains
out here, so...

520
00:46:11,148 --> 00:46:13,309
So what they complained about?

521
00:46:13,517 --> 00:46:17,078
Cause I just got out,
it's my day off

522
00:46:17,788 --> 00:46:19,653
A day off?

523
00:46:20,324 --> 00:46:24,192
And what's a day off for a
whore, you go to church or something?

524
00:46:38,642 --> 00:46:40,507
Don't you remember me?

525
00:46:40,611 --> 00:46:42,272
No

526
00:46:43,314 --> 00:46:46,249
I busted you not eight months ago for
tricking up on 95

527
00:46:49,520 --> 00:46:52,216
It seems to me you might
owe me one

528
00:46:53,557 --> 00:46:55,855
Yeah, you sure went easy
on me

529
00:46:57,094 --> 00:46:58,789
You almost broke my
fucking jaw

530
00:46:58,996 --> 00:47:01,430
Please, you do time

531
00:47:03,300 --> 00:47:05,165
Climb over

532
00:47:49,513 --> 00:47:50,775
Sel?

533
00:47:52,850 --> 00:47:54,340
Selby?

534
00:47:55,052 --> 00:47:58,681
Selby? Jeses Christ,
what're you doing

535
00:47:58,756 --> 00:48:00,155
What the fuck are you doing?

536
00:48:04,161 --> 00:48:05,287
Please drop the fucking blade

537
00:48:05,396 --> 00:48:07,296
I take you to a fucking
doctor, ok

538
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:08,863
Just stop it

539
00:48:13,204 --> 00:48:15,104
What are you talking about?

540
00:48:15,339 --> 00:48:16,431
You can stop Leen.

541
00:48:16,540 --> 00:48:17,472
Stop what?

542
00:48:17,608 --> 00:48:19,439
You can stop the game

543
00:48:20,177 --> 00:48:23,237
I'm out there trying
my best, ok?

544
00:48:23,414 --> 00:48:25,382
Why did you quit
hooking?

545
00:48:25,816 --> 00:48:29,513
Cause I needed to,
alrite?

546
00:48:29,653 --> 00:48:32,019
Because you thought I was stupid,
enough to support you?

547
00:48:32,122 --> 00:48:33,555
No, Selby

548
00:48:33,691 --> 00:48:35,488
That you wouldn't even
have to fuck me to get it

549
00:48:35,626 --> 00:48:36,615
Because I'm so hard-up

550
00:48:36,727 --> 00:48:38,786
No! no! Selby, that's
not the reason

551
00:48:38,896 --> 00:48:41,057
You said we were gonna
party, party, party...

552
00:48:41,198 --> 00:48:42,961
Well there hasn't been a fucking party!

553
00:48:45,402 --> 00:48:48,337
Nothing! when I told you
that I'm starving

554
00:48:49,707 --> 00:48:51,572
Cause you're using me
- No! I just...

555
00:48:53,077 --> 00:48:55,739
Because I fucking killed
someone, alrite?

556
00:49:02,686 --> 00:49:05,985
My last john, alrite,
I fucking killed my last john

557
00:49:06,156 --> 00:49:08,954
I was raped and beat to
fuck and was gonna get killed

558
00:49:09,126 --> 00:49:11,651
But I won't... I didn't wanna
lose you, you know...

559
00:49:11,762 --> 00:49:13,559
All I could think about was that for the rest of
your fucking life

560
00:49:15,266 --> 00:49:18,429
And you never know that
I fucking meant to be there

561
00:49:18,969 --> 00:49:21,802
I didn't wanna die,
thinking that maybe

562
00:49:22,373 --> 00:49:24,398
Maybe you could love me

563
00:49:25,609 --> 00:49:27,668
So I killed him

564
00:49:28,078 --> 00:49:34,347
I shot him, alrite...
I fucking shot him

565
00:49:41,959 --> 00:49:44,427
I'm sorry, I let you
fucking down alrite

566
00:49:44,561 --> 00:49:47,359
Now, you know me Sel,
now you fucking know me alrite

567
00:49:51,935 --> 00:49:53,300
No, I don't wanna go

568
00:49:53,504 --> 00:49:55,529
Sure you do,
sure you fucking do!

569
00:49:55,639 --> 00:49:59,200
Leave me fun,
leave me fucking fun!

570
00:50:05,616 --> 00:50:07,413
I'm sorry

571
00:50:38,615 --> 00:50:40,515
I know...

572
00:50:41,685 --> 00:50:43,744
He would have killed killed you

573
00:51:00,037 --> 00:51:01,698
I need to get this taken off and
I'm gonna get a job

574
00:51:04,174 --> 00:51:07,974
No, I understand that
if you can't get a work

575
00:51:08,245 --> 00:51:10,042
I don't even mind

576
00:51:13,217 --> 00:51:16,709
I wanted to go back before
it was just... so shit scared of getting caught

577
00:51:16,854 --> 00:51:19,084
You know that was the
only reason

578
00:51:25,896 --> 00:51:27,796
I'm a hooker

579
00:51:59,530 --> 00:52:01,122
You got a wet pussy?

580
00:52:03,934 --> 00:52:05,765
Yes, sure

581
00:52:06,937 --> 00:52:08,529
You like to fuck?

582
00:52:11,742 --> 00:52:13,175
Yup

583
00:52:15,112 --> 00:52:19,549
Jesus Christ, you'll think nobody
ever talked dirty to you before

584
00:52:21,952 --> 00:52:24,785
I just like to settle
first, you know

585
00:52:28,158 --> 00:52:30,683
Call me daddy,
while I fuck you

586
00:52:31,428 --> 00:52:34,329
I try, what you like
to fuck your kids?

587
00:52:34,965 --> 00:52:45,705
What? I'm just kidding
with you

588
00:52:46,443 --> 00:52:48,343
I'm just messing with you

589
00:52:49,213 --> 00:52:51,204
I'll call you daddy

590
00:52:51,882 --> 00:52:53,713
Daddy, see?

591
00:52:53,851 --> 00:52:55,443
See, I'm calling you daddy

592
00:52:55,486 --> 00:52:57,181
I do it all the time

593
00:52:59,923 --> 00:53:01,151
$20 huh?

594
00:53:01,658 --> 00:53:03,455
Yup

595
00:53:06,396 --> 00:53:08,296
Some good shit here!

596
00:53:16,039 --> 00:53:19,531
Come on, you wanna suck it for me

597
00:53:22,312 --> 00:53:23,779
Come on baby

598
00:54:40,791 --> 00:54:44,192
Life is funny... it's hard

599
00:54:44,661 --> 00:54:48,825
But it's also strange, how things can
be so different than you think

600
00:54:50,500 --> 00:54:53,663
I remember I was just a
kid in before age club...

601
00:54:53,770 --> 00:54:59,140
Set up this beautiful gigantic red and yellow ferris
wheel. It lit up to nite sky

602
00:54:59,810 --> 00:55:03,143
They called it... the Monster

603
00:55:05,148 --> 00:55:06,410
You want some money?

604
00:55:09,820 --> 00:55:12,345
Oh my god,
are you serious?

605
00:55:12,889 --> 00:55:15,858
When I was a kid I thought that was
about the coolest thing I ever seen

606
00:55:15,993 --> 00:55:17,858
Then I couldn't wait to ride it

607
00:55:18,028 --> 00:55:21,429
Sure enough, when I finally got my
chance I got so scared and nauseous...

608
00:55:21,598 --> 00:55:24,931
I threw up all over myself
before it even made 1 full turn

609
00:55:25,869 --> 00:55:27,734
I gonna go and wash up ok

610
00:55:36,980 --> 00:55:39,182
Just hang on a sec, babe, I gotta
wash up here, ok?

611
00:55:39,217 --> 00:55:40,774
Ok

612
00:55:42,653 --> 00:55:45,144
Hey where did you
get the car?

613
00:55:47,824 --> 00:55:55,253
My friend, Thomas, saw me on my way
home, he let us borrow it to move

614
00:55:56,099 --> 00:55:57,191
We're moving?

615
00:55:57,334 --> 00:55:59,097
Yes, fuck this place, rite?

616
00:55:59,202 --> 00:56:01,329
This no place for my girl

617
00:56:02,172 --> 00:56:05,403
Oh, man, a real place?
an apartment?

618
00:56:05,438 --> 00:56:08,634
Ya what you happy now?
- Yeah, I'm happy

619
00:56:08,679 --> 00:56:10,874
I know baby, I know

620
00:56:12,215 --> 00:56:14,308
We're good now,
I told you

621
00:56:14,418 --> 00:56:16,147
And that's what I mean

622
00:56:16,253 --> 00:56:20,155
In my life, it has always been the
harmless stuff that hurt the most

623
00:56:21,058 --> 00:56:24,255
When there're things so horribly,
you can't even imagine it

624
00:56:24,394 --> 00:56:26,919
It's usually a lot easier
than you think

625
00:56:29,166 --> 00:56:32,761
You never really know,
until you're the one standing there

626
00:57:07,838 --> 00:57:09,169
No problem

627
00:57:13,043 --> 00:57:14,533
How is your arm?

628
00:57:17,013 --> 00:57:18,571
It looks weird

629
00:57:29,793 --> 00:57:31,260
So ok?

630
00:57:39,503 --> 00:57:42,028
Cos I knew I was coming
home to you

631
00:57:53,984 --> 00:57:55,952
I love you

632
01:00:03,346 --> 01:00:04,608
Waitress

633
01:00:12,923 --> 01:00:16,620
This stuff is so good
thanks for taking me here

634
01:00:18,028 --> 01:00:21,657
It's ok, it's ok you know

635
01:00:22,165 --> 01:00:25,657
It's pretty fine, but.. man, someday
I'm gonna take you to some...

636
01:00:25,769 --> 01:00:29,432
Real top places in the
Keys, like some reaI classy joints

637
01:00:29,539 --> 01:00:31,473
Keys?
- Yeah

638
01:00:31,608 --> 01:00:33,269
I always wanna go to Keys

639
01:00:33,443 --> 01:00:36,344
I always wanna have a
house on the beach, you know

640
01:00:36,479 --> 01:00:39,039
But I haven't even been to the beach
since I've been here

641
01:00:39,215 --> 01:00:42,309
So gal I'll buy you a house
on the beach, how about that?

642
01:00:43,320 --> 01:00:46,414
Those places are like thousands
of thousands of dollars

643
01:00:46,523 --> 01:00:50,220
So what? You think I can't
get you a house on the beach?

644
01:00:51,828 --> 01:00:53,352
What else you want?

645
01:00:56,433 --> 01:00:58,924
You want a little purple porsh huh?

646
01:00:59,836 --> 01:01:01,360
This is no-smoking area

647
01:01:01,938 --> 01:01:03,769
You have to put the cigarette out

648
01:01:04,040 --> 01:01:06,065
What are you doing, man?
you gonna sing us a song or what?

649
01:01:06,209 --> 01:01:07,335
Let me have that

650
01:01:07,377 --> 01:01:08,071
Get your fucking hand off her

651
01:01:08,211 --> 01:01:09,974
You piece of shit!

652
01:01:14,417 --> 01:01:16,476
We're paying fucking
customer here

653
01:01:16,653 --> 01:01:19,451
What? what you got?

654
01:01:19,556 --> 01:01:21,251
You wanna bring it on?

655
01:01:22,826 --> 01:01:24,487
You all better watch your
fucking food...

656
01:01:24,594 --> 01:01:27,563
Cos there was a fucking cockroach
in mine, size like this

657
01:01:27,697 --> 01:01:30,291
This is not how you run a
fucking establishment man

658
01:01:55,859 --> 01:01:57,986
So what's your deal, man?

659
01:01:58,495 --> 01:02:00,053
Where you like to fuck

660
01:02:01,531 --> 01:02:03,431
Like to fuck in the back?

661
01:02:03,867 --> 01:02:05,835
So really like to get
real rough?

662
01:02:09,172 --> 01:02:12,369
Shit, I bet you get real
rough back there huh?

663
01:02:12,509 --> 01:02:14,272
Real nasty

664
01:02:14,744 --> 01:02:16,405
You like that huh?

665
01:02:18,648 --> 01:02:21,014
Maybe you wanna slap me
round a little bit huh?

666
01:02:23,319 --> 01:02:25,480
Don't think I don't
see it, man

667
01:02:26,489 --> 01:02:28,684
What, you can't speak?
what the fuck?

668
01:02:29,025 --> 01:02:29,548

669
01:02:29,759 --> 01:02:30,885
Cat got your fucking tongue huh?

01:02:31,361 --> 01:02:34,296
I don't like it rough

671
01:02:35,198 --> 01:02:43,230
I've never done this before,

672
01:03:08,465 --> 01:03:10,558
Take your pants off

673
01:03:51,207 --> 01:03:52,868
Thank you.

You are welcome

675
01:04:46,329 --> 01:04:48,593
You wanna have a
beer with me?

676
01:04:51,568 --> 01:04:53,092
Don't you wanna
come to bed?

677
01:04:54,771 --> 01:04:56,602

678
01:05:17,794 --> 01:05:18,954
Wake up

679
01:05:20,496 --> 01:05:22,794
Wake up, I wanna go out

01:05:43,886 --> 01:05:46,377
Hey, mind if I angle in on those nuts?

Flick his chair over,

683
01:05:57,867 --> 01:06:01,394
Fucking office job rite?

And talking to people all day long,

01:06:05,942 --> 01:06:07,603
Sounds like you're at fun world

686
01:06:13,950 --> 01:06:15,542
What's fun world?

01:06:15,818 --> 01:06:18,446

We all have to go on thursday night,

689
01:06:34,671 --> 01:06:36,138

692
01:06:39,642 --> 01:06:41,269
In that fucking car?

693
01:06:41,878 --> 01:06:44,210
So? What are you doing?

694
01:06:44,580 --> 01:06:48,380
I'm just cleaning

695
01:06:48,484 --> 01:06:50,042

01:06:52,455 --> 01:06:55,982
We don't need this

698
01:06:56,326 --> 01:06:58,760
Who the fuck told you

01:06:59,228 --> 01:07:00,718
Leen what difference

700

01:07:17,313 --> 01:07:19,474
Not in my fucking friend's
car, you are not!

706
01:07:19,615 --> 01:07:21,845
Fine, fine, then I'll walk

707
01:07:21,984 --> 01:07:25,750
Ok, I don't wanna sit
here alone all the time,

708
01:07:25,922 --> 01:07:27,787
I wanna go out I wanna
meet people

709
01:07:27,890 --> 01:07:32,350
I wanna hang out with people
without you fucking scaring them off

710
01:07:37,066 --> 01:07:38,727
Where would you like to go?

711
01:07:38,968 --> 01:07:40,265
I don't know...

712
01:07:40,436 --> 01:07:44,668
Travel... see different
places

713
01:07:45,575 --> 01:07:47,600
We could go to Fun World

714
01:07:49,178 --> 01:07:50,975
You wanna go to Fun World?

715
01:07:52,348 --> 01:07:53,110
Not now

716
01:07:53,249 --> 01:07:55,615
No, now I gotta take the
fucking car back

717
01:07:55,718 --> 01:07:58,983
And now we don't have any
fucking money like usual, Selby

718
01:07:59,088 --> 01:08:00,282
So, you're leaving?

719
01:08:21,077 --> 01:08:22,738
Hey Selby, check it out

720
01:08:23,946 --> 01:08:25,743
Hey, there're my friends

721
01:08:26,983 --> 01:08:29,975
Hey remember me?

722
01:08:30,253 --> 01:08:32,050
I figure you guys would be here

723
01:08:40,663 --> 01:08:42,062
I loved her...

724
01:08:42,598 --> 01:08:45,032
But the thing no one ever
realised about me...

725
01:08:45,134 --> 01:08:47,534
Was believe that I could learn

726
01:08:48,104 --> 01:08:50,800
I could train myself into
anything

727
01:08:52,408 --> 01:08:55,241
People always look
down their noses at hookers

728
01:08:55,978 --> 01:08:59,539
Never give you a chance because
they think you took the easy way out

729
01:08:59,715 --> 01:09:04,118
And no one could imagine the
will power it took to what we do

730
01:09:04,287 --> 01:09:07,950
Walkin the streets,
nite after nite

731
01:09:08,424 --> 01:09:11,416
Taking the hitch and still
getting back up

732
01:09:11,461 --> 01:09:13,190
We wanna go again

733
01:09:13,296 --> 01:09:16,493
But I did,
and they don't miss out

734
01:09:17,133 --> 01:09:21,001
Cause they've no idea what
I can discipline myself to

735
01:09:21,304 --> 01:09:23,329
And I believe in something

736
01:09:24,474 --> 01:09:26,567
And I believed in her

737
01:09:30,713 --> 01:09:32,044
I need to sit down

738
01:09:32,448 --> 01:09:34,939
Oh there she is
- Who is she?

739
01:09:36,052 --> 01:09:37,485
I gotta talk to her

740
01:09:37,620 --> 01:09:39,451
Hey you wanna ride
the Ferris Wheel?

741
01:09:39,856 --> 01:09:41,289
Nope

742
01:09:43,326 --> 01:09:45,021
We're gonna go sit down

743
01:10:09,352 --> 01:10:10,717
Are you ok?

744
01:10:22,698 --> 01:10:25,030
My brothers and sisters,
screwed me royal

745
01:10:25,535 --> 01:10:28,663
After my daddy killed
himself, we were out on the streets

746
01:10:28,905 --> 01:10:32,636
And the neighbors would let them stay
over but only if I didn't tag along

747
01:10:32,742 --> 01:10:34,073
So I stayed clear

748
01:10:34,210 --> 01:10:36,440
But I knew they didn't have
any money, you know

749
01:10:37,246 --> 01:10:38,713
I was having a hook
anyway...

750
01:10:38,881 --> 01:10:43,518
So I always made sure they had new cloths,
cigarettes, and stuff like that

751
01:10:43,553 --> 01:10:47,614
But then there's 1 nite, we're at this party and this
guy comes in and he's like...

752
01:10:47,723 --> 01:10:49,384
She fucked so and so

753
01:10:49,825 --> 01:10:51,793
And they're are all embarrassed..

754
01:10:52,028 --> 01:10:54,588
They were fucking standing
in the corner, all...

755
01:10:55,064 --> 01:10:59,797
So they... you know they
threw me out of the snow

756
01:11:00,136 --> 01:11:03,367
Screaming out, I'm a whore,
and they were so embarrassed...

757
01:11:03,573 --> 01:11:05,666
And they hate me
and all that

758
01:11:06,542 --> 01:11:08,009
And that was it

759
01:11:08,144 --> 01:11:11,671
I just took off never
went back

760
01:11:12,114 --> 01:11:13,775
That's really sad

761
01:11:14,817 --> 01:11:16,751
Your own family doing that to you

762
01:11:16,886 --> 01:11:19,081
That's how people are,
Selby

763
01:11:19,188 --> 01:11:21,713
Yeah... I know

764
01:11:21,857 --> 01:11:24,223
Fuck them,
who need them?

765
01:11:24,627 --> 01:11:25,787
Right

766
01:11:26,028 --> 01:11:27,120
Yeah, fuck them!

767
01:11:27,263 --> 01:11:29,163
No, right, Selby, right!

768
01:11:41,077 --> 01:11:43,511
Get out!
get the fuck out!

769
01:11:45,781 --> 01:11:46,907
You all ok?

770
01:11:51,020 --> 01:11:52,578
I'm gonna call an ambulance

771
01:11:52,622 --> 01:11:54,112
That's ok

772
01:11:54,590 --> 01:11:55,989
We don't have any insurance

773
01:11:56,125 --> 01:11:58,821
We just rather...
do it ourselves

774
01:12:14,043 --> 01:12:15,635
You know, she's good

775
01:12:16,145 --> 01:12:18,272
You have yourselves a
good day now, ok

776
01:12:31,894 --> 01:12:35,193
Let's go, Selby, now!
- No! no! I wanna drive

777
01:12:39,001 --> 01:12:41,401
He's fucking dead,
let's go, now!

778
01:12:42,271 --> 01:12:44,296
No!
- Selby!

779
01:12:58,654 --> 01:13:00,849
Who killed that man?

780
01:13:02,692 --> 01:13:04,319
What do you think?

781
01:13:04,827 --> 01:13:09,161
Oh my god, they're coming for us

782
01:13:11,067 --> 01:13:11,999
What are you talking
about?

783
01:13:12,134 --> 01:13:14,261
You fucking killing people

784
01:13:18,808 --> 01:13:22,403
Now listen to me,
they are not coming

785
01:13:25,281 --> 01:13:28,614
I never wanted you in this
shit to begin with

786
01:13:28,751 --> 01:13:30,981
But I know what
I am doing

787
01:13:31,153 --> 01:13:32,745
And you'll never gonna
understand it, alrite?

788
01:13:32,888 --> 01:13:34,856
You gotta trust me

789
01:13:42,131 --> 01:13:44,867
They don't have
1 fucking thing

790
01:13:44,902 --> 01:13:46,027
They got nothing

791
01:13:46,168 --> 01:13:49,899
They are not even looking, man,
this shit is long over already

792
01:13:50,039 --> 01:13:54,169
I didn't want wreck the fucking car in public
but we did you know, we did

793
01:13:54,276 --> 01:13:57,837
So if they'll gonna call the cops,
they would've done it by now!

794
01:13:59,381 --> 01:14:01,849
How could you?

795
01:14:03,018 --> 01:14:04,451
You knew

796
01:14:09,892 --> 01:14:13,123
No... I knew about 1... 1

797
01:14:13,262 --> 01:14:17,858
No, Selby... no Sel

798
01:14:26,742 --> 01:14:28,209
Come in here

799
01:14:34,750 --> 01:14:37,310
We're gonna have a drink, and we're
gonna forget about all this alrite?

800
01:14:37,386 --> 01:14:38,978
Cheers

801
01:14:40,055 --> 01:14:41,386
Leen, this isn't funny

802
01:14:41,590 --> 01:14:43,854
You don't know what's
going on, Sel

803
01:14:44,126 --> 01:14:48,222
I do, so if you wanna keep your
eyes shut to the whole world...

804
01:14:48,798 --> 01:14:51,358
The least you can do
is hear me out

805
01:15:05,114 --> 01:15:07,316
It's not what you
think it is, alrite

806
01:15:07,351 --> 01:15:08,283
I know what it is

807
01:15:08,384 --> 01:15:10,784
No, you don't know
my life, Selby!

808
01:15:12,288 --> 01:15:14,256
But I know yours

809
01:15:17,927 --> 01:15:20,623
And I've done everything
in the whole wide world

810
01:15:21,130 --> 01:15:23,325
Hoping that you'll never
have to know

811
01:15:24,166 --> 01:15:28,330
So that you can go on
thinking that people are good

812
01:15:28,437 --> 01:15:32,141
And kind and that it should
make sense, you know?

813
01:15:32,176 --> 01:15:34,371
Cause I love that
about your, Sel

814
01:15:34,510 --> 01:15:35,272
But I can't

815
01:15:35,377 --> 01:15:38,369
No, I don't wanna hear
that, Leen

816
01:15:39,014 --> 01:15:40,379
But you need to

817
01:15:40,549 --> 01:15:43,347
We can be as different as we
wanna be, but you can't kill people

818
01:15:53,863 --> 01:15:56,297
I'm good with the Lord

819
01:15:56,498 --> 01:15:58,022
I'm fine with him

820
01:16:00,536 --> 01:16:02,401
And I know how you were raised alrite

821
01:16:02,504 --> 01:16:06,304
And I know how people fucking think out
there and fuck it's gotta be that way

822
01:16:06,408 --> 01:16:07,375
They gonna tell you that 'thou shall not kill' and
all that

823
01:16:10,045 --> 01:16:12,036
But that's not the way the
world works, Selby

824
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:15,378
Cause I'm out there,
every fucking day living it

825
01:16:16,085 --> 01:16:19,452
Who the fuck knows,
what god knows?

826
01:16:22,791 --> 01:16:26,128
People kill each other everyday

827
01:16:26,163 --> 01:16:27,755
And for what?

828
01:16:29,465 --> 01:16:33,925
For politics, for religion,
and they're heros...

829
01:16:34,103 --> 01:16:37,869
No.. no... there are a lot of
shit I can't do anymore

830
01:16:37,907 --> 01:16:39,340
But killing's not one of them

831
01:16:39,408 --> 01:16:43,139
And letting those fucking bastard going out
there raping somebody else isn't either

832
01:16:43,345 --> 01:16:45,210
No, no, Leen there
was 1 man

833
01:16:45,347 --> 01:16:47,406
They can't all
has been bad

834
01:16:48,751 --> 01:16:53,188
You know me, you think
I could do it otherwise?

835
01:16:53,489 --> 01:16:57,789
I'm not a bad person,
I'm a real good person

836
01:17:00,529 --> 01:17:04,932
So, don't feel bad,
it's life, Sel

837
01:17:05,034 --> 01:17:09,300
People like me and you go
down every fucking... day

838
01:17:15,911 --> 01:17:18,607
It's almost over,
look at this

839
01:17:19,848 --> 01:17:22,442
See this?
it's everything

840
01:17:22,584 --> 01:17:24,779
Everything you ever
wanted

841
01:17:24,954 --> 01:17:27,923
Just a little more, and a car
we're out of here

842
01:17:28,023 --> 01:17:29,820
We have a shot, Sel

843
01:17:31,026 --> 01:17:36,123
We have a shot, at a real life,
not this, a real one

844
01:17:41,937 --> 01:17:43,268
You know what to do, rite?

845
01:17:45,774 --> 01:17:47,639
See you later
- Ok

846
01:17:50,279 --> 01:17:52,770
So everything is working out,
and we are real happy

847
01:17:52,982 --> 01:17:55,075
But I just thought that you
can tell my family

848
01:17:58,220 --> 01:18:02,350
So you're choosing to go
this way

849
01:18:02,491 --> 01:18:05,358
No, this isn't a choice
I'm not choosing anything

850
01:18:05,494 --> 01:18:08,361
This is the way I am

851
01:18:08,497 --> 01:18:10,465
And I'm not gonna feel
bad about it anymore

852
01:18:10,532 --> 01:18:12,693
You can tell him that too

853
01:18:14,670 --> 01:18:18,037
I know you think you're all romantic
about that girl

854
01:18:26,648 --> 01:18:29,981
What? I'm saying it's
not their fault

855
01:18:30,552 --> 01:18:33,248
Blacks or whoever you wanna
call them, Selby

856
01:18:34,323 --> 01:18:37,520
The point is, people make
bad choices

857
01:18:38,327 --> 01:18:41,626
And they pay for it, you can see
all these miserable straight people...

858
01:18:41,997 --> 01:18:44,864
And we see you choosing, this life..
this gay life

859
01:18:45,000 --> 01:18:47,332
And even more than that, the easy life with this...

860
01:18:47,503 --> 01:18:50,631
No.. she has had a real hard life

861
01:18:52,141 --> 01:18:55,338
Lots of people have bad lives, and they
still choose to move towards the light...

862
01:18:55,444 --> 01:18:58,572
Otherwise we all be
hookers and druggies...

863
01:19:00,282 --> 01:19:02,113
I don't wanna hear this

864
01:19:02,384 --> 01:19:04,113
This is not the point

865
01:19:04,787 --> 01:19:07,017
Don't fight the world, honey

866
01:19:07,589 --> 01:19:10,456
There's so much more than just love out there

867
01:19:10,559 --> 01:19:16,020
And someday all you gonna want is a roof over your
head even if you do have to sleep with a man to get it

868
01:19:16,498 --> 01:19:17,965
And that's your choice

869
01:19:18,133 --> 01:19:20,624
Yeah, it is my choice

870
01:19:20,803 --> 01:19:23,328
Cos we're in love

871
01:19:23,439 --> 01:19:25,600
What? We you going on a hike?

872
01:19:29,111 --> 01:19:30,703
Man, just get rite here

873
01:19:31,046 --> 01:19:33,105
The car was good

874
01:19:33,649 --> 01:19:36,413
Not when there's a
fucking gun in it

875
01:19:38,554 --> 01:19:42,320
So, lots of people have guns

876
01:19:45,594 --> 01:19:48,791
Well you gonna undress or what?

877
01:19:48,964 --> 01:19:50,659
No, you 1st

878
01:19:54,603 --> 01:20:00,132
So... you married rite?
you don't get that fucking shit

879
01:20:00,609 --> 01:20:03,544
Come out here with strange gals,
do dirty things with them

880
01:20:05,147 --> 01:20:07,138
Why, man, so you can rape them?

881
01:20:08,684 --> 01:20:12,279
No, Good lord
- Fucking man

882
01:20:12,488 --> 01:20:14,285
I fucking hate them

883
01:20:14,490 --> 01:20:16,287
Then why are you a hooker?

884
01:20:16,425 --> 01:20:19,861
I'm not a hooker, see,
I don't fuck, man

885
01:20:20,596 --> 01:20:23,827
Used to, mostly against my will though

886
01:20:23,932 --> 01:20:26,628
This old guy used to rape me when I was eight

887
01:20:27,269 --> 01:20:30,432
Real good friend of my
dad's, you know

888
01:20:32,007 --> 01:20:34,202
So I go to my dad,
tell him what's going on...

889
01:20:34,343 --> 01:20:36,504
My dad don't fucking
believe me, so...

890
01:20:36,645 --> 01:20:38,636
His friend keeps raping
me for years

891
01:20:41,116 --> 01:20:45,576
And that's my dad... fucking
beats me up for it

892
01:20:47,990 --> 01:20:50,356
Where the fuck do you
think you are going?

893
01:20:50,792 --> 01:20:54,663
I'm not doing it,
but I feel sorry for you

894
01:20:54,698 --> 01:20:57,131
If you want a ride
you better come on

895
01:20:57,266 --> 01:20:59,461
I don't need a ride, man

896
01:21:01,303 --> 01:21:02,827
I don't need a ride

897
01:21:06,508 --> 01:21:08,999
Cause I wanna take
your car

898
01:21:09,845 --> 01:21:10,903
You fucking think I'm stupid
enough...

899
01:21:11,046 --> 01:21:14,812
To get back into your fucking car
with you when there's a gun?

900
01:21:17,486 --> 01:21:18,817
Please!

901
01:21:22,157 --> 01:21:24,557
Victor Borne,
that was his name

902
01:21:24,660 --> 01:21:28,687
My dad's friend...
some friend

903
01:21:31,433 --> 01:21:34,095
Years later I found out he
died in a car accident

904
01:21:36,171 --> 01:21:39,607
It's like God finally strike him down
for all his evil

905
01:21:40,342 --> 01:21:43,402
No, you can't get away
from your shit forever

906
01:21:44,880 --> 01:21:47,872
Soon or later,
it's gonna catch up with you

907
01:21:48,217 --> 01:21:49,809
Motherfucker!

908
01:21:50,719 --> 01:21:52,186
Where's the car?

909
01:21:53,755 --> 01:21:55,689
Got all fucked up!

910
01:21:56,758 --> 01:21:58,783
Is that everything?

911
01:21:58,961 --> 01:22:02,727
Got beer? fucking man,
I think we should just go

912
01:22:02,798 --> 01:22:03,526
How?

913
01:22:03,699 --> 01:22:05,189
Take the bus

914
01:22:05,367 --> 01:22:06,732
We have enough money, rite?

915
01:22:06,935 --> 01:22:07,697
We do?

916
01:22:07,769 --> 01:22:10,203
I don't know whatever,
I'll fucking hook down there whatever

917
01:22:12,341 --> 01:22:14,372
We can't take all our shit
on the bus

918
01:22:14,407 --> 01:22:16,404
I can't get one rite now,
ok, Sel

919
01:22:18,247 --> 01:22:19,475
What happened?

920
01:22:19,648 --> 01:22:22,674
Fucking cop, the guy
I wasn't even gonna do it...

921
01:22:22,784 --> 01:22:24,149
Then he has a fucking
gun in his car...

922
01:22:24,319 --> 01:22:26,617
So I popped him sure enough
he's a fucking cop

923
01:22:27,422 --> 01:22:29,549
I think he was retired or
something but still, man...

924
01:22:29,691 --> 01:22:31,158
I can't take the fucking car,
it was a cop car

925
01:22:31,360 --> 01:22:33,157
It got some fucking tracking device in there

926
01:22:33,328 --> 01:22:33,919
Shit!

927
01:22:34,062 --> 01:22:36,826
Fucker, tried to fucking trick me,
while he's got a fucking gun in there

928
01:22:36,932 --> 01:22:38,695
Keep it down

929
01:22:42,638 --> 01:22:45,072
Well you just have to go
and get us another one

930
01:22:48,944 --> 01:22:52,180
No... no... not changing your
mind on me

931
01:22:52,215 --> 01:22:53,374
Please

932
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:57,475
Leen... this isn't my plan
this is your deal, ok

933
01:22:57,619 --> 01:22:59,917
Your plan, the house
and the beach

934
01:23:00,255 --> 01:23:02,780
Self-employed,
just like you said, your plan

935
01:23:02,891 --> 01:23:04,722
So you just have to go and
get us another car...

936
01:23:04,860 --> 01:23:06,794
We are leaving now

937
01:23:07,696 --> 01:23:09,459
Get up!

938
01:23:12,801 --> 01:23:19,172
Alrite... you just give
me a sec

939
01:23:35,490 --> 01:23:38,186
I'm gonna try to get out of
here before the end of the week

940
01:23:38,927 --> 01:23:41,589
That's good,
I'm proud of you

941
01:23:41,763 --> 01:23:44,288
Yes, I just wanted to say
good bye to you, Tom

942
01:23:44,433 --> 01:23:45,957
You've been real
good to me

943
01:23:50,806 --> 01:23:51,966
Are you alrite?

944
01:23:52,140 --> 01:23:54,631
Yes, it's nothing

945
01:23:57,412 --> 01:24:00,575
Sometime, I feel like everybody
just think I'm just a fat shitty fucking person

946
01:24:01,883 --> 01:24:04,653
All I'm fucking trying
to do is survive, you know

947
01:24:04,688 --> 01:24:06,678
I know
- Yeah

948
01:24:06,855 --> 01:24:08,482
I know exactly

949
01:24:08,924 --> 01:24:11,051
I know what you
do for living

950
01:24:11,226 --> 01:24:12,784
But It doesn't bother
me at all

951
01:24:12,894 --> 01:24:16,330
I know you didn't dial it up
on a god dammed telephone

952
01:24:16,465 --> 01:24:19,559
That's where you lended,
that's what you've had to do

953
01:24:19,735 --> 01:24:23,466
What you're feeling rite now,
is just guilt

954
01:24:23,572 --> 01:24:26,775
Over something you've had
absolutely no control over

955
01:24:26,810 --> 01:24:29,642
You know how many of us
came back from the war?

956
01:24:29,778 --> 01:24:31,109
And almost kill ourselves...

957
01:24:31,279 --> 01:24:34,612
Because we felt exactly the
samething you do rite now!

958
01:24:34,983 --> 01:24:36,917
Yeah?
- Yeah

959
01:24:37,018 --> 01:24:38,110
And I never get it

960
01:24:38,253 --> 01:24:40,278
They don't get it now,
they never get it then...

961
01:24:40,422 --> 01:24:43,448
And they sure as hell wouldn't
ever get fucking circumstances

962
01:24:43,592 --> 01:24:47,892
Fuck, man, circumstance that's
exactly it, that's exactly it

963
01:24:48,363 --> 01:24:50,888
You know, it's like I feel
like I never had a fucking choice

964
01:24:50,999 --> 01:24:53,365
You never did,
but you got a live

965
01:24:54,202 --> 01:24:56,033
You got a live

966
01:25:14,856 --> 01:25:18,849
We are not able to positively
confirm a profile at this time...

967
01:25:18,927 --> 01:25:21,395
However the evidence does
suggest that...

968
01:25:21,430 --> 01:25:25,890
The murderers had their current
stirring some face of the Central Act

969
01:25:26,067 --> 01:25:27,932
Perhaps that's the act
prostitution?

970
01:25:34,609 --> 01:25:37,737
Yeah, that's exactly right

971
01:25:47,422 --> 01:25:48,946
Get the fuck out of here

972
01:25:49,758 --> 01:25:51,783
Get the fuck out of here!

973
01:26:52,254 --> 01:26:54,586
These here my kids

974
01:26:55,023 --> 01:26:56,490
They are down in Miami...

975
01:26:56,691 --> 01:26:59,888
So I'm just trying to make
a couples of extra bucks, you know what i'm saying?

976
01:27:02,731 --> 01:27:04,323
They ok?

977
01:27:07,035 --> 01:27:08,764
They are fine

978
01:27:09,504 --> 01:27:11,734
I'm just trying to
make some money

979
01:27:13,375 --> 01:27:15,070
Can you help me out?

980
01:27:16,278 --> 01:27:19,907
Maybe I can help you
out, you know?

981
01:27:20,015 --> 01:27:24,179
If you need some help, I'll do what
I can to get you back with your kids

982
01:27:24,452 --> 01:27:29,446
Maybe you need a room,
shower, some warm clothes...

983
01:27:29,658 --> 01:27:31,353
My son's room is empty
if you want it

984
01:27:31,593 --> 01:27:34,585
And I'm sure my wife
wouldn't mind a bit

985
01:27:34,930 --> 01:27:36,124
Pull the car over
- I'm sorry

986
01:27:36,264 --> 01:27:37,731
No, just pull the car over

987
01:27:38,600 --> 01:27:40,465
The car's still rolling,
you can't get out

988
01:27:40,635 --> 01:27:42,000
Stop... the car

989
01:27:42,671 --> 01:27:46,038
Listen, they can't barely see
you out there

990
01:27:59,821 --> 01:28:02,051
Are you in some kind
of...

991
01:28:04,092 --> 01:28:06,287
Just drive the car

992
01:28:21,576 --> 01:28:23,066
Stop rite here

993
01:28:24,713 --> 01:28:27,910
Look there ain't othing that we can't fix

994
01:28:30,619 --> 01:28:32,587
Get out of the car

995
01:28:43,164 --> 01:28:47,498
The keys in the car,
that's my wallet

996
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:53,106
Turn around

997
01:28:53,208 --> 01:28:55,301
No, madam... no

998
01:28:57,145 --> 01:28:58,806
You don't have to do this

999
01:28:58,913 --> 01:28:59,937
Get down

1000
01:29:01,650 --> 01:29:03,641
You really don't

1001
01:29:07,222 --> 01:29:08,519
I can't

1002
01:29:08,723 --> 01:29:10,156
You don't have to

1003
01:29:10,325 --> 01:29:14,091
You just having a hard time
- No, I can't let you live

1004
01:29:16,865 --> 01:29:20,699
Oh God, my wife...
my wife

1005
01:29:21,002 --> 01:29:25,132
My daughter is having a baby
- Shut the fuck up!

1006
01:29:28,410 --> 01:29:30,241
Oh God I'm sorry

1007
01:30:03,078 --> 01:30:04,545
I got a car, Sel

1008
01:30:04,979 --> 01:30:07,277
We gotta go, alrite,
you gotta drive

1009
01:30:09,818 --> 01:30:12,844
It's out
- What, what's out?

1010
01:30:13,021 --> 01:30:15,182
Sketches of us

1011
01:30:39,481 --> 01:30:40,971
You're all set

1012
01:30:43,084 --> 01:30:46,451
So you'll gonna get in tomorrow
alrite?

1013
01:30:49,157 --> 01:30:53,218
I always said I'll take you to the
bus, I'll take it, you know

1014
01:30:53,394 --> 01:30:55,225
Where I wanted to go

1015
01:31:36,638 --> 01:31:41,439
I know I did...
I did the fuck up!

1016
01:31:59,460 --> 01:32:04,898
Maybe you can...
help me?

1017
01:32:17,011 --> 01:32:21,004
I don't know... if I can
forgive myself for...

1018
01:32:31,860 --> 01:32:35,296
You'll come back to me,
You'll come back

1019
01:32:46,507 --> 01:32:52,070
I mean, you come back here
and we go far far away

1020
01:32:58,386 --> 01:32:59,580
Go

1021
01:33:09,998 --> 01:33:13,092
No

You take it, and

1025
01:34:35,883 --> 01:34:38,113

1026
01:34:38,252 --> 01:34:42,245
Hey, this is my only
friend, Tom

1027
01:34:46,060 --> 01:34:49,587
We've got a fire outside,
the old conversation pit

1028
01:34:51,299 --> 01:34:52,823
Oh come on

1029
01:35:06,848 --> 01:35:09,373
You run away fast
- What?

1030
01:35:09,550 --> 01:35:12,610
Yes you are, I wanna
drive you out of here

1031
01:35:15,056 --> 01:35:19,015
I gotta stay here by the
phone for my girl

1032
01:35:19,060 --> 01:35:21,153
Cause I gotta call her

1033
01:35:22,130 --> 01:35:24,360
Cause she left, Tom

1034
01:35:25,233 --> 01:35:28,999
But she's gonna come back, ok

1035
01:35:30,838 --> 01:35:33,432
You've got a fucking wife and
you tell me to come with you...

1036
01:35:33,541 --> 01:35:36,066
What the fuck are you
doing, man?

1037
01:35:36,210 --> 01:35:41,113
Not you, Tom,
not fucking you, Tom

1038
01:35:41,416 --> 01:35:43,179
Fuck, man!

1039
01:35:57,031 --> 01:35:59,192
You got some bucks

1040
01:35:59,567 --> 01:36:00,864
You want change?

01:36:04,505 --> 01:36:05,631
So if you want, come

My car is over there

01:36:11,646 --> 01:36:14,479
Yes, rite over there,

1046
01:36:24,559 --> 01:36:26,959
Man, what the fuck

01:36:51,486 --> 01:36:53,784
Oh man, it's good to

1050
01:36:53,921 --> 01:36:55,115
Yeah you too

1051
01:36:55,289 --> 01:36:56,916
So, you back down
here huh?

1052
01:36:57,191 --> 01:37:01,491
Yeah, I came down to
see what was going on

1053
01:37:04,098 --> 01:37:08,091
Oh man, am I glad to hear that

1054
01:37:10,605 --> 01:37:13,665
Yeah?
- no, we all rite, because...

1055
01:37:13,808 --> 01:37:18,108
They caught in here with some old
warrant or something, you know

1056
01:37:19,447 --> 01:37:21,244
But, I'm...

1057
01:37:23,217 --> 01:37:24,275
Where are you now?

1058
01:37:24,452 --> 01:37:26,113
In a motel room

1059
01:37:27,655 --> 01:37:30,647
I wished I was there
with you rite now

1060
01:37:34,295 --> 01:37:39,062
But Leen... they went
up to see my parents

1061
01:37:39,333 --> 01:37:41,267
They were asking all
kind of questions

1062
01:37:42,036 --> 01:37:44,061
Yeah, you now well

1063
01:37:44,705 --> 01:37:47,572
I rather not talk on the
phone here, you know...

1064
01:37:47,675 --> 01:37:52,169
Because, because I don't
know if they're, you know...

1065
01:37:52,346 --> 01:37:55,406
But... don't worry about
that, Sel

1066
01:37:55,583 --> 01:37:59,178
I mean that's just some mistaken identity
or something, you know

1067
01:37:59,587 --> 01:38:00,815
They've got nothing

1068
01:38:00,988 --> 01:38:03,189
So just talk about
us, you know?

1069
01:38:03,224 --> 01:38:06,785
I can't Leen, my picture's
on the paper

1070
01:38:07,161 --> 01:38:09,356
From when we crashed the car

1071
01:38:10,364 --> 01:38:14,528
Selby... what are you
talking about?

1072
01:38:14,702 --> 01:38:17,865
I'm talking about when
we crashed the red car

1073
01:38:19,106 --> 01:38:20,733
Why are you saying that?

1074
01:38:20,908 --> 01:38:23,706
Cause I'm freaking out...
they know Leen

1075
01:38:24,445 --> 01:38:28,506
They know, and they've come after me,
and I know, I'm gonna go down

1076
01:38:28,649 --> 01:38:36,522
No, Selby, I wouldn't do that,
you know, I would never do that ok

1077
01:38:36,857 --> 01:38:40,816
So... just chill out
here, ok?

1078
01:38:40,962 --> 01:38:42,657
How am I supposed
to do that?

1079
01:38:42,830 --> 01:38:45,230
You gonna let me go down for
something you did

1080
01:38:45,333 --> 01:38:49,326
Selby, I didn't do anything

1081
01:38:54,542 --> 01:38:57,067
Leen, you know what
I'm talking about

1082
01:39:00,715 --> 01:39:02,307
What are you doing?

1083
01:39:04,151 --> 01:39:05,982
I'm not doing anything

1084
01:39:10,992 --> 01:39:13,222
Where's the money, Sel?

1085
01:39:15,062 --> 01:39:16,791
What money?

1086
01:39:17,665 --> 01:39:21,294
The money I gave you

1087
01:39:22,470 --> 01:39:24,734
What are you talking about?

1088
01:39:26,474 --> 01:39:29,068
I don't know what are
you talking about, Leen

1089
01:39:35,950 --> 01:39:38,612
Nothing, just some change

1090
01:39:38,753 --> 01:39:41,688
Yeah, I got that

1091
01:39:47,395 --> 01:39:50,125
I just wanna leave, Leen

1092
01:39:51,666 --> 01:39:54,134
I just want a normal
happy life

1093
01:39:54,268 --> 01:39:56,600
I don't know why you
did this

1094
01:39:59,807 --> 01:40:01,741
Cause I love you

1095
01:40:04,011 --> 01:40:09,779
Cause I love you, and I never
wanted to lose you that's all

1096
01:40:11,052 --> 01:40:16,046
I love you with all my heart,
my soul, my mind

1097
01:40:16,824 --> 01:40:20,954
And I never let you
down, alrite

1098
01:40:24,598 --> 01:40:26,395
Cause it was me

1099
01:40:27,735 --> 01:40:30,761
It was only me

1100
01:40:30,971 --> 01:40:33,030
And I'll tell them that, ok

1101
01:40:33,307 --> 01:40:35,298
But it's over for me now

1102
01:40:35,543 --> 01:40:37,841
I'm never gonna see you again

1103
01:40:56,197 --> 01:40:58,529
That people could forgive you for
something like this, you know?

1104
01:41:01,102 --> 01:41:02,797
But they can't...

1105
01:41:02,937 --> 01:41:04,734
They can't end

1106
01:41:59,760 --> 01:42:01,159
Thank you Judge

1107
01:42:01,929 --> 01:42:04,591
And may you rot in hell...

1108
01:42:04,698 --> 01:42:08,429
Sentence a raped women to death

1109
01:42:08,669 --> 01:42:12,264
And you all, you are just
bunch of scum, that's what you are

1110
01:42:21,449 --> 01:42:23,280
Faith can move mountains

1111
01:42:24,318 --> 01:42:26,718
Love would always run away

1112
01:42:28,022 --> 01:42:30,547
Everything happens for a reason

1113
01:42:31,492 --> 01:42:34,928
For when there's life, there's hope

1114
01:42:39,033 --> 01:42:40,694
Hope...

1115
01:42:41,202 --> 01:42:43,136
They've gotta tell you something
