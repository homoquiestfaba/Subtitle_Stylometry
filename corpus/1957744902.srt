177
00:13:11,559 --> 00:13:14,228
No, I'm not.
But I fucked a man who is.

178
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:17,140
Were they having an argument?

179
00:13:17,164 --> 00:13:18,600
I don't know.

180
00:13:18,633 --> 00:13:20,200
They're not here though,
are they?

181
00:13:23,871 --> 00:13:25,339
(TAPS)

182
00:13:25,372 --> 00:13:27,575
Thank you, Dally.
Friends.

183
00:13:27,609 --> 00:13:30,512
Life is but a sport
or a pastime,

184
00:13:30,545 --> 00:13:33,447
as the Qur'an tells us.

185
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,983
And, because it is
a game and nothing more,

186
00:13:36,016 --> 00:13:39,286
we forget that the point
of life is death.

187
00:13:39,320 --> 00:13:42,456
So, eat, drink, be merry,
for tomorrow we die.

188
00:13:43,457 --> 00:13:45,392
A little hackneyed, my love.

189
00:13:54,602 --> 00:13:56,136
What do you think
of the outfits?

190
00:13:56,170 --> 00:13:58,105
I designed them myself.

191
00:13:58,138 --> 00:14:00,508
Completely authentic.

192
00:14:00,542 --> 00:14:03,010
- Are they?
- Yeah they are.

193
00:14:03,043 --> 00:14:04,546
They may as well be statues.

194
00:14:04,579 --> 00:14:05,547
What's that supposed to mean?

195
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:09,883
- What kind of name is Dally?
- It's a nickname.

196
00:14:09,917 --> 00:14:12,453
An insult or an endearment?

197
00:14:12,486 --> 00:14:14,221
- Take your fucking pick.
- (LAUGHS)

198
00:14:31,171 --> 00:14:32,206
What.

199
00:14:35,643 --> 00:14:36,643
Dicky.

200
00:14:37,645 --> 00:14:42,650
(♪♪♪)

201
00:14:59,133 --> 00:15:00,502
Good God.

202
00:15:00,535 --> 00:15:03,036
Hit him on the road.
It's very unclear.

203
00:15:03,070 --> 00:15:05,507
Unclear?
Why would it be unclear?

204
00:15:05,540 --> 00:15:07,417
They say he was selling fossils
by the side of the road.

205
00:15:07,441 --> 00:15:09,511
He stepped out
and they hit him by accident.

206
00:15:11,345 --> 00:15:12,956
But there has never been
a fossil seller on that road

207
00:15:12,980 --> 00:15:14,616
at night.

208
00:15:14,649 --> 00:15:17,017
Or during the day.
That's why it's unclear.

209
00:15:17,050 --> 00:15:19,153
Anyone recognize him?

210
00:15:19,186 --> 00:15:22,022
No, he's not from here.
He's from the South.

211
00:15:25,527 --> 00:15:27,494
RICHARD: What about
the tattoo? A diamond.

212
00:15:29,430 --> 00:15:30,964
Ouarida.

213
00:15:30,998 --> 00:15:33,066
It is for protection
against the evil eye.

214
00:15:34,301 --> 00:15:36,170
Didn't bloody work then, did it?

215
00:15:36,203 --> 00:15:38,272
Lay him out somewhere.

216
00:15:38,305 --> 00:15:41,275
- The garage?
- Yes, the garage. Good idea.

217
00:15:41,308 --> 00:15:42,385
We don't want the guests
getting wind

218
00:15:42,409 --> 00:15:43,453
there's a body on the premises.

219
00:15:43,477 --> 00:15:44,546
Last thing we need.

220
00:15:45,747 --> 00:15:47,715
Shall we clean out the car?

221
00:15:47,749 --> 00:15:50,951
No, we have to call
the police in Taza.

222
00:16:00,027 --> 00:16:02,329
Smashed headlights,
smashed bumper.

223
00:16:02,362 --> 00:16:04,666
Must have been going
at a fair clip.

224
00:16:04,699 --> 00:16:06,266
An accident, they said.

225
00:16:08,670 --> 00:16:10,471
Do you believe them?

226
00:16:10,505 --> 00:16:12,415
They are your guests.
How am I not to believe them?

227
00:16:12,439 --> 00:16:14,542
But do you in fact believe them?

228
00:16:14,576 --> 00:16:17,478
I think they're scared.
And I'm thinking of a proverb.

229
00:16:19,747 --> 00:16:22,750
Go ahead.
I like a good proverb.

230
00:16:22,784 --> 00:16:25,152
Open your door to a good day

231
00:16:25,185 --> 00:16:27,387
and prepare yourself
for a bad one.

232
00:16:27,421 --> 00:16:32,527
(♪♪♪)

233
00:16:58,686 --> 00:17:01,021
- David.
- Richard.

234
00:17:02,857 --> 00:17:04,291
How are you feeling?

235
00:17:05,793 --> 00:17:06,961
Bloody hot.

236
00:17:06,995 --> 00:17:10,197
- It's the Sahara, old boy.
- I know it's the fucking Sahara.

237
00:17:13,735 --> 00:17:15,168
Uh. (SNIFFLES)

238
00:17:16,804 --> 00:17:18,238
You're dressed for dinner.

239
00:17:19,541 --> 00:17:21,241
So, the world's still normal.

240
00:17:22,544 --> 00:17:25,580
You should get changed.
Both of you. Get changed.

241
00:17:25,613 --> 00:17:28,115
Have a shower,
turn up for dinner.

242
00:17:28,148 --> 00:17:30,618
Police will be here in an hour.

243
00:17:30,652 --> 00:17:32,696
I know the officer in charge.
It will be a formality.

244
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:34,388
Oh, a formality, okay.

245
00:17:34,421 --> 00:17:35,523
How did it happen?

246
00:17:36,758 --> 00:17:38,134
You should tell me
before we tell the police.

247
00:17:38,158 --> 00:17:40,093
Get everything ironed out.

248
00:17:40,127 --> 00:17:43,330
We were bowling along
looking for the sign for Azna.

249
00:17:45,499 --> 00:17:48,603
And there was a lot of sand
blowing across the road.

250
00:17:48,636 --> 00:17:50,070
I couldn't see.

251
00:17:54,474 --> 00:17:57,477
And he just stepped out
in front of us

252
00:17:57,512 --> 00:18:00,180
like he didn't understand
the speed of a car.

253
00:18:00,213 --> 00:18:04,117
The fact is we hit him.
We hit him and we killed him.

254
00:18:04,151 --> 00:18:07,454
Well, the main thing
is to come clean,

255
00:18:07,487 --> 00:18:09,389
cooperate with the police

256
00:18:09,423 --> 00:18:12,092
and seem
overwhelmingly contrite.

257
00:18:13,561 --> 00:18:15,897
- We can do that, can't we?
- Mmm.

258
00:18:15,930 --> 00:18:18,165
If it's absolutely necessary.

259
00:18:19,232 --> 00:18:20,367
David.

260
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:26,139
Poor fucking kid.
When are the cops getting here?

261
00:18:26,173 --> 00:18:28,208
They arrive when they arrive.

262
00:18:28,241 --> 00:18:30,812
They arrive when they arrive.
What kind of fucking...?

263
00:18:30,845 --> 00:18:33,681
Hey, this is a fucking disaster.

264
00:18:33,715 --> 00:18:35,559
- Have you checked his pockets?
- Yeah, nothing in him.

265
00:18:35,583 --> 00:18:37,518
No ID, not a single dirham,
no nothing.

266
00:18:37,552 --> 00:18:38,762
It's highly unusual
for a Moroccan

267
00:18:38,786 --> 00:18:41,188
- not to be carrying ID.
- You're telling me.

268
00:18:41,221 --> 00:18:42,724
Hey, where are those
fuckers anyway?

269
00:18:42,757 --> 00:18:44,659
Dinner. Putting a brave face
on things.

270
00:18:44,692 --> 00:18:47,629
- Was he drunk?
- I don't know.

271
00:18:48,696 --> 00:18:49,897
They ran right over him.

272
00:18:49,931 --> 00:18:52,366
The kid wasn't just hit.
Am I right?

273
00:18:52,399 --> 00:18:53,400
Am I right?!

274
00:18:54,736 --> 00:18:58,205
What are we going to do?
I mean, you called the cops.

275
00:18:58,238 --> 00:19:00,808
Now, it's going to be
a fucking circus.

276
00:19:00,842 --> 00:19:03,176
What would you suggest we do?

277
00:19:03,210 --> 00:19:04,746
Get it settled tonight.
Pay him off.

278
00:19:07,314 --> 00:19:08,626
They'd have to find out
who he is.

279
00:19:08,650 --> 00:19:11,318
If they find that out,
things might change.

280
00:19:11,351 --> 00:19:14,756
Jesus. (EXHALES)
Are you kidding?

281
00:19:14,789 --> 00:19:16,432
I don't think we have anything
to worry about.

282
00:19:16,456 --> 00:19:18,760
- It's clear what happened.
- Oh, it is, is it?

283
00:19:18,793 --> 00:19:20,236
Cause I don't think
it's clear at all.

284
00:19:20,260 --> 00:19:21,796
I think that limey
is hiding something.

285
00:19:21,829 --> 00:19:24,732
Any chance to fuck with us
and they will.

286
00:19:24,766 --> 00:19:26,634
- Who?
- The Moroccans!

287
00:19:26,668 --> 00:19:29,771
The family will show up
and they will fuck with us!

288
00:19:29,804 --> 00:19:32,239
They'll say the infidels
killed their boy.

289
00:19:33,508 --> 00:19:35,208
Which would be true.

290
00:19:35,242 --> 00:19:37,512
We were saying
you must have had an accident.

291
00:19:37,545 --> 00:19:38,546
A flat tire.

292
00:19:38,579 --> 00:19:41,549
People always get flat tires
out in the desert.

293
00:19:42,784 --> 00:19:45,318
We all felt sorry for you.

294
00:19:45,352 --> 00:19:47,387
A flat tire in the dark.

295
00:19:48,455 --> 00:19:50,290
What a drag. Was it?

296
00:19:50,323 --> 00:19:52,860
- Can't you see they want to eat?
- No, it's all right.

297
00:19:52,894 --> 00:19:54,529
We just need some time
to recover.

298
00:19:55,663 --> 00:19:59,967
People disappear here.
They just vanish.

299
00:20:02,269 --> 00:20:04,404
Did the Arabs molest you?

300
00:20:04,438 --> 00:20:06,273
I'm sorry, I didn't get your...

301
00:20:07,575 --> 00:20:08,676
<i>Enchanté.</i>

302
00:20:10,377 --> 00:20:11,612
She's a nomad.

303
00:20:13,581 --> 00:20:15,950
LEILA:
Did you pass Beni Mellal?

304
00:20:15,983 --> 00:20:18,953
We came through Midelt.
It's a different road.

305
00:20:18,986 --> 00:20:20,387
Did you get lost?

306
00:20:20,420 --> 00:20:21,522
We didn't get lost.

307
00:20:21,556 --> 00:20:23,825
It was just a long
slog of a drive.

308
00:20:23,858 --> 00:20:24,935
It's the road
most of us came on.

309
00:20:24,959 --> 00:20:26,728
Yes, but we didn't know it.

310
00:20:26,761 --> 00:20:28,462
We didn't know
which turning it was.

311
00:20:28,495 --> 00:20:32,633
So, it wasn't a flat tire.
You were just lost.

312
00:20:32,667 --> 00:20:34,468
Not exactly.

313
00:20:34,502 --> 00:20:36,804
We hit a Moroccan on the road
and we killed him.

314
00:20:50,785 --> 00:20:54,287
It was an accident.
He stepped out in front of us.

315
00:21:01,562 --> 00:21:02,764
I think you're wanted.

316
00:21:05,900 --> 00:21:07,568
I can't understand
why you did that.

317
00:21:07,602 --> 00:21:09,504
Was it to humiliate me?

318
00:21:09,537 --> 00:21:11,672
You can't keep pretending
forever. Why lie to them?

319
00:21:11,706 --> 00:21:12,916
But it wasn't our fault, was it?

320
00:21:12,940 --> 00:21:14,350
I mean,
you don't seriously expect me

321
00:21:14,374 --> 00:21:15,176
to take the fault for this

322
00:21:15,209 --> 00:21:16,844
just because
some fucking carjacker

323
00:21:16,878 --> 00:21:17,888
- decided to shoot the two of...
- Carjacker.

324
00:21:17,912 --> 00:21:19,814
Carjacker, yes.

325
00:21:19,847 --> 00:21:22,349
You haven't been
following the news. I have.

326
00:21:23,885 --> 00:21:26,053
You have a practice in Chelsea,
monsieur Henninger.

327
00:21:26,087 --> 00:21:29,489
Uhm, yes, that's... Yes.

328
00:21:29,524 --> 00:21:30,591
And you, madam?

329
00:21:31,726 --> 00:21:34,061
You write children's books,
I believe?

330
00:21:34,095 --> 00:21:37,598
Not very successful ones,
I'm afraid, Captain.

331
00:21:37,632 --> 00:21:39,534
I'm sure
you're just being modest.

332
00:21:39,567 --> 00:21:41,669
May I have a title
I could look up for my children?

333
00:21:42,603 --> 00:21:45,907
The last one was called
<i>Balthazar's Nighttime.</i>

334
00:21:45,940 --> 00:21:47,407
It's a little pretentious.

335
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,811
Ah, but it is charming.

336
00:21:49,844 --> 00:21:51,946
Do you not find,
monsieur Galloway?

337
00:21:51,979 --> 00:21:53,313
Charming.

338
00:21:55,116 --> 00:21:57,450
This man you killed.

339
00:21:57,484 --> 00:21:59,954
Boy, I should say.
He was a fossil seller.

340
00:21:59,987 --> 00:22:01,856
Yes, but I mean...

341
00:22:01,889 --> 00:22:03,356
It was clear
he wasn't interested

342
00:22:03,390 --> 00:22:05,059
in selling us fossils.

343
00:22:05,092 --> 00:22:07,862
How could he be?
This time of night.

344
00:22:07,895 --> 00:22:09,797
Middle of bloody nowhere.

345
00:22:09,831 --> 00:22:13,034
People here are desperate,
monsieur Henninger.

346
00:22:13,067 --> 00:22:15,703
They would do almost anything
to sell a single fossil.

347
00:22:15,736 --> 00:22:18,573
Forty Euros is a good sum
for them.

348
00:22:18,606 --> 00:22:21,642
I'm aware of that.
I know they're poor.

349
00:22:21,676 --> 00:22:23,476
We're really very sorry
about this, captain.

350
00:22:23,511 --> 00:22:24,511
I mean...

351
00:22:25,847 --> 00:22:27,447
We're devastated, to be honest.

352
00:22:27,480 --> 00:22:28,983
(SNIFFLES)

353
00:22:29,016 --> 00:22:30,117
Yeah, devastated.

354
00:22:33,187 --> 00:22:34,622
I'm sure you are.

355
00:22:37,058 --> 00:22:39,060
By the way, I was wondering.

356
00:22:39,093 --> 00:22:41,128
You are sure there was
only one boy?

357
00:22:41,162 --> 00:22:45,833
- They often travel in pairs.
- Uh, yes, one boy.

358
00:22:45,867 --> 00:22:46,877
CAPTAIN BENIHADD:
You are sure.

359
00:22:46,901 --> 00:22:49,804
- Yes, we're sure.
- Good.

360
00:22:49,837 --> 00:22:51,471
We will record it
as an accidental death.

361
00:22:52,974 --> 00:22:54,876
You'll take the body with you?

362
00:22:54,909 --> 00:22:56,019
CAPTAIN BENIHADD (OS/ON):
No, we cannot do that.

363
00:22:56,043 --> 00:22:57,745
We do not have a morgue
at our post.

364
00:22:57,778 --> 00:22:59,814
There'll have to be arrangements
made tomorrow.

365
00:22:59,847 --> 00:23:01,525
Hope you can enjoy the rest
of your weekend,

366
00:23:01,549 --> 00:23:03,117
monsieur Galloway.

367
00:23:03,150 --> 00:23:05,030
The fire-eaters from Taza
are arriving tomorrow.

368
00:23:05,653 --> 00:23:06,693
CAPTAIN BENIHADD:
Splendid.

369
00:23:07,889 --> 00:23:12,927
(♪♪♪)

370
00:23:18,966 --> 00:23:20,968
What do we make
of the Henningers?

371
00:23:21,002 --> 00:23:24,171
She's all right.
Not sure about him.

372
00:23:25,472 --> 00:23:26,574
Typical bourgeois.

373
00:23:28,910 --> 00:23:31,078
- What are you doing?
- Stepping on diamonds.

374
00:23:32,079 --> 00:23:34,048
It's taboo.

375
00:23:34,081 --> 00:23:35,783
I hope the genies
get pissed off.

376
00:23:35,816 --> 00:23:36,884
God's sake, David.

377
00:23:36,918 --> 00:23:39,720
Oh, I hate all this ethnic
pretense and affectation.

378
00:23:39,754 --> 00:23:41,022
You can treat people decently

379
00:23:41,055 --> 00:23:43,057
without rolling their carpets
out everywhere.

380
00:23:43,090 --> 00:23:44,090
Bloody kitsch.

381
00:23:45,893 --> 00:23:47,494
A drink drink? Mm.

382
00:23:49,096 --> 00:23:51,198
Hot chocolate's good. Yum.

383
00:23:54,969 --> 00:23:56,971
I don't like the sound
of those dogs.

384
00:23:57,004 --> 00:23:58,205
They should drive them off.

385
00:23:58,239 --> 00:24:00,517
I think they're wild camels.
I heard one of the staff say...

386
00:24:00,541 --> 00:24:02,777
Staff? Servants, you mean?

387
00:24:02,810 --> 00:24:04,477
Oh, whatever.

388
00:24:04,512 --> 00:24:06,714
They should still
drive them off.

389
00:24:06,747 --> 00:24:07,747
Camels bite.

390
00:24:09,617 --> 00:24:11,519
I hear they do.

391
00:24:11,552 --> 00:24:13,187
They like to bite people
in the stomach.

392
00:24:13,220 --> 00:24:15,823
It's the leading cause
of death among the Arabs.

393
00:24:15,856 --> 00:24:17,858
The police will do nothing.

394
00:24:17,892 --> 00:24:19,827
And what do you expect them
to do?

395
00:24:19,860 --> 00:24:22,930
I heard one of the boys saying
his legs were pulped.

396
00:24:25,766 --> 00:24:27,101
The dead man.
Pulped?

397
00:24:28,169 --> 00:24:29,837
They didn't just hit him.

398
00:24:29,870 --> 00:24:32,640
They run over him.
Maybe more than once.

399
00:24:32,673 --> 00:24:34,508
Bullshit.

400
00:24:34,542 --> 00:24:36,510
What do they call it
in your country?

401
00:24:36,544 --> 00:24:38,846
- They have a word for it?
- Roadkill.

402
00:24:38,879 --> 00:24:40,648
I think we should
get some sleep.

403
00:24:40,681 --> 00:24:42,083
Why? (CHUCKLES)

404
00:24:42,683 --> 00:24:44,952
I'm loosening up finally.

405
00:24:44,986 --> 00:24:46,196
The sun's gonna be up
in a few hours

406
00:24:46,220 --> 00:24:48,089
and I want to sleep it off.

407
00:24:48,122 --> 00:24:50,691
They won't come back.
The police.

408
00:24:54,028 --> 00:24:57,565
- Did Richard bribe them?
- Yeah, possibly.

409
00:24:57,598 --> 00:24:59,038
It's actually a huge
hassle for them.

410
00:24:59,066 --> 00:25:00,701
So much paperwork involved.

411
00:25:03,104 --> 00:25:05,206
- And, I hate to say it...
- No, you don't.

412
00:25:07,141 --> 00:25:09,610
I hate to say it,
but the kid is a nobody.

413
00:25:10,745 --> 00:25:13,714
He's from a village far away
and no one knows who he is.

414
00:25:16,851 --> 00:25:18,586
No ID, no witnesses.

415
00:25:22,790 --> 00:25:23,790
So, that's that.

416
00:25:25,659 --> 00:25:26,861
That's that.

00:26:44,004 --> 00:26:45,004
Morning.

421
00:26:54,982 --> 00:26:57,818
- You forgot the honey.
- Madam?

422
00:26:59,854 --> 00:27:01,088
Never mind.

423
00:27:01,422 --> 00:27:03,290
Do you have any idea
where my husband is?

424
00:27:03,324 --> 00:27:04,358
Horse riding.

425
00:27:08,796 --> 00:27:10,164
Horse riding.

426
00:27:10,197 --> 00:27:13,801
Have I told you how much
I admire your boots, ladies?

427
00:27:13,834 --> 00:27:15,936
They give one something
to grab hold of, don't they?

428
00:27:15,970 --> 00:27:17,738
Given half a chance.

429
00:27:17,771 --> 00:27:19,840
Have I told you
how loathsome I find you,

430
00:27:19,874 --> 00:27:22,343
- monsieur Henninger?
- You didn't mention it, no.

431
00:27:22,376 --> 00:27:24,845
And please call me David
if you're going to insult me.

432
00:27:24,879 --> 00:27:27,815
I'd slap your bottom for you,
but I know you'd just enjoy it.

433
00:27:27,848 --> 00:27:29,850
I certainly would.

434
00:27:29,884 --> 00:27:32,186
I must say I'm enjoying
this little threesome immensely.

436
00:27:44,899 --> 00:27:47,835
Very picturesque, I suppose,
in a banal sort of way.

437

Why did Richard
and Dally come here?

438
00:27:52,139 --> 00:27:53,807
Gays have always come
to North Africa.

439
00:27:53,841 --> 00:27:56,143
Usually to bugger
little Arab boys.

- ISABELLE: <i>Mon dieu</i>.

That is such
an offensive thing to say.

442
00:28:00,181 --> 00:28:01,715
Interesting.
You said it was offensive,

443
00:28:01,749 --> 00:28:02,917
not that it wasn't true.

444
00:28:04,418 --> 00:28:06,353
I thought Richard
was a friend of yours.

445
00:28:06,387 --> 00:28:09,123
He is.
I was speaking historically.

446
00:28:09,156 --> 00:28:11,158

Pederasts. The lot of them.

You're a real shit-stirrer,
aren't you, David?

450
00:28:23,404 --> 00:28:25,406
Well, it passes the time

451
00:28:25,439 --> 00:28:27,741
in an increasingly
tedious world.

452
00:28:27,775 --> 00:28:29,176
I was saying to Richard...

What were you doing
in Casablanca?

461
00:29:04,812 --> 00:29:06,380
I was playing ping-pong
with a hooker

462
00:29:06,413 --> 00:29:07,948
at the Tahiti hotel.

463
00:29:10,518 --> 00:29:12,520
I've heard about
that kind of ping-pong.

Wanna know why?

00:29:17,525 --> 00:29:19,393
Did she do anal?

467
00:29:19,426 --> 00:29:22,062
What's the point of a hooker
if she doesn't do anal?

468
00:29:22,096 --> 00:29:23,816
I'm going to tell your mother
you said that.

00:29:24,832 --> 00:29:27,134

This is a strange place
for a holiday home.

It's like they're living out
some kind of fantasy,

- I guess.
- I like it here.

477
00:29:44,519 --> 00:29:47,087
It feels like a country
where useless men can be happy.

you've become

00:31:05,499 --> 00:31:09,069
- Is that all it takes?
- They could have blinded me.

- Maybe someone from the morgue.
- Do they even have morgues?

Don't they just throw the body
in a pit or something?

512

There's a morgue in Errachidia.
Might be a pick up from them.

Oh, they're a horrible bore.

they're the only ones

they have post traumatic

- I'm sure it is what they have.

00:31:42,604 --> 00:31:44,539
Let's face it, babe. Pirates.

522
00:31:44,572 --> 00:31:46,608
A bit cheesy,
a bit fucking eighties.

523
00:31:46,641 --> 00:31:48,275
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.

524
00:31:48,308 --> 00:31:50,578
Hardly keeping
with the aesthetic though.

525
00:31:50,612 --> 00:31:53,347
You always pooh-pooh my ideas.
And they're not just pirates.

526
00:31:53,380 --> 00:31:56,383
They are buccaneers and wenches,
and sexy swashbucklers.

527
00:31:56,417 --> 00:31:57,451
All right.

528
00:31:57,484 --> 00:31:58,529
Just as long
as they don't end up

529
00:31:58,553 --> 00:32:00,187
plundering any of my paintings.

530
00:32:02,590 --> 00:32:03,991
You were right
about the Henningers.

531
00:32:04,024 --> 00:32:05,736
We should have invited
the Bainbridges instead.

532
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,095
Yeah, they're generally wacko.

533
00:32:08,128 --> 00:32:09,728
And they don't kill people
on the way up.

534
00:32:11,498 --> 00:32:16,437
(♪♪♪)

535
00:33:06,386 --> 00:33:08,322
The father?

536
00:33:08,355 --> 00:33:09,990
You'll leave him
kneeling there all day?

537
00:33:10,792 --> 00:33:14,328
- They are Aït Kebash.
- So...

538
00:33:15,462 --> 00:33:17,397
They will try
to extort money from you.

539
00:33:18,065 --> 00:33:20,267
DALLY:
Where do the Aït Kebash live?

540
00:33:20,300 --> 00:33:22,336
HAMID:
Far. Far out.

541
00:33:22,369 --> 00:33:24,271
Then they've come a long way.
Open the gate.

542
00:33:24,304 --> 00:33:25,707
They will blackmail you.

543
00:33:25,740 --> 00:33:27,307
The men of the desert
know everything.

544
00:33:27,341 --> 00:33:28,819
No, they don't.
They just assume the worst,

545
00:33:28,843 --> 00:33:30,603
which makes them right
nine times out of ten.

546
00:34:44,919 --> 00:34:47,421
(SPEAKING INDISTINCTLY)

547
00:34:56,631 --> 00:34:57,732
What.

548
00:34:58,700 --> 00:35:00,400
He said the Englishman must pay.

549
00:35:03,538 --> 00:35:04,606
Fuck that.

550
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,475
Pay the old crow.
Make him go away.

551
00:35:08,509 --> 00:35:10,588
You don't pay someone for
an accident, for fuck's sake.

552
00:35:10,612 --> 00:35:12,245
You don't even know
how much he wants.

553
00:35:12,279 --> 00:35:13,319
Might just be 1,000 Euros.

554
00:35:13,347 --> 00:35:15,291
- Or a fuck of a lot more.
- That's nothing for us.

555
00:35:15,315 --> 00:35:17,484
- It's blackmail.
- RICHARD: So what if it is?

556
00:35:17,518 --> 00:35:19,621
What's the word for blackmail
in their language?

557
00:35:19,654 --> 00:35:21,188
If they even have one.

558
00:35:21,221 --> 00:35:23,256
You think villages in the Sahara
are living in shit

559
00:35:23,290 --> 00:35:23,958
in the same way we do?

560
00:35:23,992 --> 00:35:25,627
It's the principle of the thing.

561
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:28,328
It's the principle of the thing
plus 1,000 Euros.

562
00:35:28,362 --> 00:35:29,831
That seems like
a pretty good deal

563
00:35:29,864 --> 00:35:31,164
for the cost of a life.

564
00:35:31,198 --> 00:35:32,634
Not when I'm being robbed.

565
00:35:32,667 --> 00:35:34,636
You're not being robbed.
You're being spared.

566
00:35:34,669 --> 00:35:36,771
Why? What are they going
to do to me?

567
00:35:36,804 --> 00:35:39,641
Lynch me? (CHUCKLES)
Public castration?

568
00:35:39,674 --> 00:35:41,843
I wasn't thinking
about them lynching you.

569
00:35:41,876 --> 00:35:43,921
And I wasn't thinking about them
cutting off your cock.

570
00:35:43,945 --> 00:35:45,647
I was thinking about them
not going away.

571
00:35:45,680 --> 00:35:48,382
Of course,
your precious weekend.

572
00:35:48,415 --> 00:35:50,283
Must not forget
your bloody party.

573
00:35:50,317 --> 00:35:53,186
What about contacting
the consulate in Casablanca?

574
00:35:53,220 --> 00:35:54,187
I don't think
you're really considering

575
00:35:54,221 --> 00:35:55,757
your own best interests.

576
00:35:55,790 --> 00:35:57,725
If we contact the consulate,
there'd have to be

577
00:35:57,759 --> 00:35:58,836
a thorough look
at this whole thing.

578
00:35:58,860 --> 00:36:01,562
And I mean thorough.

579
00:36:01,596 --> 00:36:03,540
- I don't think you want that.
- I would welcome the consulate...

580
00:36:03,564 --> 00:36:06,466
RICHARD: No, David.
I don't think you would.

581
00:36:12,640 --> 00:36:13,941
- Fine, I'll go.
- No.

582
00:36:13,975 --> 00:36:14,909
I would like to pay
my respects anyway.

583
00:36:14,942 --> 00:36:17,979
No. That is absolutely
out of the question.

584
00:36:18,012 --> 00:36:19,814
You know how these people are.

585
00:36:19,847 --> 00:36:21,916
It'd make things
so much more awkward.

586
00:36:21,949 --> 00:36:24,418
Well, we wouldn't want
to make things awkward.

587
00:36:24,451 --> 00:36:29,322
(♪♪♪)

588
00:36:37,364 --> 00:36:40,233
I see Lord Swanthorne's arrived.

589
00:36:42,704 --> 00:36:45,673
- Do you know him?
- From the club.

590
00:36:45,707 --> 00:36:47,942
Perfect parasite,
but amusing in his way.

591
00:36:54,414 --> 00:36:55,516
So, how's the practice?

592
00:36:55,550 --> 00:36:57,685
- Not too good.
- Huh.

593
00:36:57,719 --> 00:37:00,555
Bit of a dearth of skin cancers
in London at the moment.

594
00:37:00,588 --> 00:37:04,625
I was sued by a patient.
Old woman in Chiswick.

595
00:37:04,659 --> 00:37:06,326
Cost me an arm and a leg.

596
00:37:06,359 --> 00:37:08,963
- Oh, dear. I didn't hear.
- No, you didn't.

597
00:37:09,997 --> 00:37:11,666
It's my life.
If it goes wrong,

598
00:37:11,699 --> 00:37:13,333
I'd rather it went wrong
in private.

599
00:37:14,102 --> 00:37:16,938
- What happened?
- Forensic fuck-up.

600
00:37:16,971 --> 00:37:18,906
Didn't spot the tumours
for what they were.

601
00:37:21,475 --> 00:37:22,844
Human error.

602
00:37:22,877 --> 00:37:26,013
- And the old woman...
- She's dying.

603
00:37:26,047 --> 00:37:28,448
Ah, sorry.

604
00:37:28,482 --> 00:37:30,162
So, it cost her an arm
and a leg too, then.

605
00:37:45,800 --> 00:37:47,668
The old boy probably
won't know any English.

606
00:37:47,702 --> 00:37:48,746
You speak French, don't you?

607
00:37:48,770 --> 00:37:50,738
Of course,
I speak fucking French.

608
00:37:59,346 --> 00:38:00,586
You sure you're ready for this?

609
00:38:10,124 --> 00:38:11,458
After you.

610
00:38:37,618 --> 00:38:39,352
He says he will speak to me.

611
00:38:39,386 --> 00:38:40,922
Perhaps because
you're not believers.

612
00:38:40,955 --> 00:38:43,390
- Oh, here we go.
- No, it's fine.

613
00:38:43,423 --> 00:38:44,491
Go ahead.

614
00:39:18,659 --> 00:39:20,695
He wants you to return with them
to bury the boy.

615
00:39:22,029 --> 00:39:24,098
What the fuck?

616
00:39:24,131 --> 00:39:26,100
And if you are a man of hon our,
you will do it.

617
00:39:26,133 --> 00:39:27,668
It is customary in these parts.

618
00:39:27,702 --> 00:39:29,871
Is it customary in these parts?

619
00:39:29,904 --> 00:39:32,874
These are not the people I know.
They're Berber.

620
00:39:32,907 --> 00:39:35,676
If they say it is their custom,
I have to believe them.

621
00:39:35,710 --> 00:39:37,545
Did he did mention money?

622
00:39:37,578 --> 00:39:40,480
No, but it will be understood.
We don't speak of such things.

623
00:39:40,514 --> 00:39:44,018
- David has to know the amount.
- I cannot ask him that.

624
00:39:45,686 --> 00:39:46,897
Monsieur David just has to take
a certain amount with him.

625
00:39:46,921 --> 00:39:50,091
DAVID: Monsieur David
hasn't agreed to this absurd plan.

626
00:39:50,124 --> 00:39:53,194
Go back with him to his village?
Are you bonkers?

627
00:39:53,227 --> 00:39:54,929
It may be
you don't have a choice.

628
00:39:56,496 --> 00:39:57,798
He's not entirely asking you.

629
00:39:57,832 --> 00:40:01,102
He's being polite,
but I think he will insist.

630
00:40:01,135 --> 00:40:02,546
Going back to their village
for a night

631
00:40:02,570 --> 00:40:03,638
and paying your respects

632
00:40:03,671 --> 00:40:05,806
would be a bloody sight
easier than anything else.

633
00:40:05,840 --> 00:40:07,084
You'll be back
in a couple of days.

634
00:40:07,108 --> 00:40:08,075
Has it occurred to you, Dicky,

635
00:40:08,109 --> 00:40:10,044
that he might actually
be planning something

636
00:40:10,077 --> 00:40:13,047
a lot nastier than anything
you can anticipate

637
00:40:13,080 --> 00:40:16,550
since he thinks I bunked off
his fucking kid and all that?

638
00:40:16,584 --> 00:40:19,153
- You're exaggerating, monsieur.
- Am I? Am I really?

639
00:40:19,186 --> 00:40:22,156
Yeah. Yeah, you are.
They won't pull any stunts.

640
00:40:22,189 --> 00:40:23,791
They're afraid
of the Moroccan police.

641
00:40:23,824 --> 00:40:26,060
Well they might be fucking ISIS
for all I know.

642
00:40:29,230 --> 00:40:30,932
Are you this paranoid
all the time?

643
00:40:32,833 --> 00:40:35,102
I don't hear
you volunteering, Yank.

644
00:40:35,136 --> 00:40:36,604
That's because
I didn't kill him.

645
00:40:36,637 --> 00:40:37,939
Well I didn't fucking kill him.

646
00:40:37,972 --> 00:40:39,116
He just stepped out
in front of me.

647
00:40:39,140 --> 00:40:42,076
- His name was Driss.
- Yes, I...

648
00:40:44,745 --> 00:40:48,149
Driss. Driss, right.

649

DAVID: What does it
matter? One way or the other,

651
00:41:07,635 --> 00:41:09,837
everyone thinks
I'm guilty anyway.

652
00:41:16,711 --> 00:41:18,913
What a jolly weekend
this has turned out to be.

655
00:41:48,909 --> 00:41:49,909
How'd it go?

656
00:41:52,279 --> 00:41:54,815
Dicky and the Arab servant

657
00:41:54,849 --> 00:41:58,119
have cooked up
a perfectly wonderful wease.

658
00:41:58,152 --> 00:42:00,621
I'm to go back
with the old geezer

659
00:42:00,654 --> 00:42:01,622
to his village

660
00:42:01,655 --> 00:42:04,725
in the middle of nowhere
and do some atonement.

661
00:42:04,759 --> 00:42:06,236
Fuck that. They could be ISIS
for all we know.

662
00:42:06,260 --> 00:42:10,064
That's what I said.
Didn't go down too well.

663
00:42:10,097 --> 00:42:12,767
- Had to smooth things over.
- What'd you say?

664
00:42:17,004 --> 00:42:18,539
I agreed to go.

665
00:42:22,243 --> 00:42:24,612
Everyone seems to think
it's the only thing to do.

666
00:42:25,946 --> 00:42:27,226
And I imagine
it might get nasty.

667
00:42:32,153 --> 00:42:36,123
- How was he, the father?
- Inscrutable.

668
00:42:36,157 --> 00:42:37,925
And it's just you
that has to go?

669
00:42:37,958 --> 00:42:39,226
Just me.

670
00:42:39,260 --> 00:42:40,094
They're probably worried

671
00:42:40,127 --> 00:42:42,029
you'll get your period
or something.

672
00:42:42,063 --> 00:42:43,898
The man just lost
his son, David.

673
00:42:43,931 --> 00:42:45,599
I'm sure
that they have their rituals

674
00:42:45,633 --> 00:42:47,234
just like everyone else.

675
00:42:47,268 --> 00:42:48,936
DAVID:
Maybe it's a good idea.

676
00:42:49,570 --> 00:42:51,806
We don't want the police
showing up again,

677
00:42:51,839 --> 00:42:53,274
poking their noses
into everything.

678
00:42:54,375 --> 00:42:56,710
No, I suppose we don't.

679
00:42:57,546 --> 00:43:00,681
May I remind you, Jo,
you got into a car with a drunk,

680
00:43:00,714 --> 00:43:03,350
which makes you an accessory
before and after the fact.

681
00:43:03,384 --> 00:43:04,952
JO:
Funny that.

682
00:43:04,985 --> 00:43:07,188
Like I've been an accessory
for a long time now.

683
00:43:15,996 --> 00:43:17,374
I'm sure
Richard wouldn't let you go

684
00:43:17,398 --> 00:43:18,632
if there was a risk.

685
00:43:19,867 --> 00:43:22,770
It'll be fine.
A little jolly in the desert.

686
00:43:22,803 --> 00:43:24,972
Might even enjoy myself,
who knows?

687
00:43:27,741 --> 00:43:29,376
Probably just wants closure,
that's all.

688
00:43:31,112 --> 00:43:32,880
That's what people
always want these days.

689
00:43:34,081 --> 00:43:35,950
It's like being
on fucking Oprah.

690
00:43:36,750 --> 00:43:38,228
A bit of an outdated

01:18:22,469 --> 01:18:25,339
I only do it now

1037
01:18:25,372 --> 01:18:27,074
You're such a liar.

1038
01:18:28,242 --> 01:18:29,786
You look fucking hot tonight

1039
01:18:29,810 --> 01:18:31,912
That's just the coke talking.

1040
01:18:31,946 --> 01:18:34,882
I think it's good you've got
some time to yourself, Jo.

1041
01:18:34,915 --> 01:18:36,083
I think you needed it.

1042
01:18:36,116 --> 01:18:38,085
It would be great
if I wasn't so worried.

1043
01:18:43,057 --> 01:18:44,758
You know
you'll never be accepted here,

1045
01:18:46,126 --> 01:18:48,195
Being an infidel and all.

1046
01:18:49,230 --> 01:18:51,031
Why should they accept them?

1047
01:18:51,065 --> 01:18:53,000
They have every reason
to hate them.

1048
01:18:53,033 --> 01:18:55,078
I'd have thought they'd have
more reason to hate you.

1049
01:18:55,102 --> 01:18:57,838
France has excellent relations
with the Arabs.

1050
01:18:57,871 --> 01:18:59,974
We share the Mediterranean
with them.

- I understand.

1053
01:19:04,178 --> 01:19:06,089

but do you feel close to them...

1054
01:19:06,113 --> 01:19:08,182

in the suburbs

1055
01:19:08,215 --> 01:19:09,984
and ransacking your synagogues?

1056
01:19:10,017 --> 01:19:12,920
That is just, how do you say,
a probleme social?

1057
01:19:12,953 --> 01:19:14,431
No, they dislike you
for the same reason

1058
01:19:14,455 --> 01:19:15,856
they dislike us.

1059
01:19:15,889 --> 01:19:17,501
We're not Muslims
and we lord it over them.

1060
01:19:17,525 --> 01:19:18,892
It's against what they regard

1061
01:19:18,926 --> 01:19:20,103
as the natural order of things

1062
01:19:20,127 --> 01:19:22,463
which would be
them lording over us.

1063
01:19:22,496 --> 01:19:24,532
I don't hold it
against them though.

1064
01:19:24,566 --> 01:19:26,200
They're rival imperialists.

1065
01:19:26,233 --> 01:19:28,802
But in America, Muslims
are peaceful and prosperous.

1066
01:19:28,836 --> 01:19:29,913
They don't spend their time

1067
01:19:29,937 --> 01:19:32,239

with garbage cans.

- Okay, okay, okay.

1074
01:19:48,922 --> 01:19:51,158

We're masochists

Yeah, we enjoy it.
It makes us feel

1078
01:19:55,996 --> 01:19:57,565
more important
than we actually are.

1079
01:19:57,599 --> 01:20:00,067
Blame us less and we'd be
a lot more humble.

1080
01:20:00,100 --> 01:20:00,934
We wouldn't think that

It was recovered by the police.

1097

They returned it to me
because it is so valuable.

1098
01:22:40,194 --> 01:22:45,733
It is called an Elvis.
An Elvis?

1099
01:22:45,767 --> 01:22:50,003
Only three specimens
have been found in the Sahara...

1100
01:22:51,038 --> 01:22:54,609
and the dealers decided
to give it the name of Elvis...

1101
01:22:55,209 --> 01:22:57,745
because it is a superstar.

1102
01:23:00,180 --> 01:23:01,982
Driss stole it from me.

The young boys are frustrated.

1105

They feel they're going nowhere.

1106
01:23:17,732 --> 01:23:20,067
And have no hopes.

1107
01:23:21,769 --> 01:23:24,506
They don't want to be diggers

1108

They don't want to live
like their fathers.

They want to escape.

1110
01:23:33,681 --> 01:23:35,517
So, they steal an Elvis...

And in a way,
I wished them luck.

It's only a fossil after all.

1124

Guess we were an obvious couple.

1212

All couples are rather
obvious in the end.

1213
01:36:33,762 --> 01:36:37,097

- Twelve years.

that long when you say it fast.

would have happened...

01:36:53,280 --> 01:36:55,583

- Driss?

01:50:48,149 --> 01:50:49,850
Yeah, I have an idea
for a new book.

1382
01:50:52,753 --> 01:50:53,988
Congratulations.

1383
01:50:58,726 --> 01:51:00,770
You know, we're more than happy
for you to stay an extra night.

1384
01:51:00,794 --> 01:51:03,797
Makes more sense for you
to start out early tomorrow.

1385
01:51:03,831 --> 01:51:06,300
No, I slept all afternoon.
We'll drive through the night...

1386
01:51:06,333 --> 01:51:09,003
and get back to Tangier
in a single leap I think.

1387
01:51:09,036 --> 01:51:09,870
I know what you're thinking,

1388
01:51:09,904 --> 01:51:12,039
but lightning
doesn't strike twice.

1389
01:51:12,072 --> 01:51:14,175
Yeah, it does.

1390
01:51:14,208 --> 01:51:16,877
Well, we fixed the car
as best we could.

1391
01:51:16,911 --> 01:51:18,288
There's a picnic hamper
in the back seat.

1392
01:51:18,312 --> 01:51:20,080
The booze is nonalcoholic.

1393
01:51:20,114 --> 01:51:22,049
(BOTH LAUGHS)

1394
01:51:23,284 --> 01:51:24,284
Anyway...

1395
01:51:27,254 --> 01:51:28,923
It's all ended
peacefully enough.

1396
01:51:30,257 --> 01:51:31,959
Not for the boy, I know, but...

1397
01:51:32,893 --> 01:51:35,829
for everyone else
it could have been a lot worse.

1398
01:51:35,863 --> 01:51:37,865
They have any interest
in carpets

1399
01:51:37,898 --> 01:51:39,266
out there out in the desert?

1400
01:51:39,300 --> 01:51:41,202
I've never seen anything
from that far out.

1401
01:51:41,235 --> 01:51:43,270
I didn't notice the carpets.

1402
01:51:43,304 --> 01:51:45,272
Did you see Tom
before he got off?

1403
01:51:45,306 --> 01:51:46,106
No.

1404
01:51:46,140 --> 01:51:47,875
He got off without us
seeing him.

1405
01:51:47,908 --> 01:51:49,143
How'd he do that, Dicky?

1406
01:51:50,311 --> 01:51:53,847
Don't know.
He's a slippery chap.

1407
01:51:55,416 --> 01:51:57,785
See him once a year and I
never know who he is really.

1408
01:51:57,818 --> 01:52:00,287
- Who's Tom?
- The American.

1409
01:52:02,356 --> 01:52:03,857
The American?

1410
01:52:10,898 --> 01:52:13,100
Oh, of course.

1411
01:52:16,503 --> 01:52:18,472
Give us a call
when you get back.

1412
01:52:18,505 --> 01:52:21,242
We always worry until we know
people are home safe.

1413
01:52:21,275 --> 01:52:24,078
And treat yourself
to something nice in Tangier.

1414
01:52:24,111 --> 01:52:26,413
It does wonders, you know,
a little retail therapy.

1415
01:52:26,447 --> 01:52:27,881
Will do that. Bye.

1416
01:52:28,849 --> 01:52:29,917
DALLY:
Bye.

1417
01:52:35,022 --> 01:52:37,124
- Safe journey, David.
- Goodbye, Hamid.

1418
01:52:48,469 --> 01:52:52,106
- What a ghastly weekend.
- That French bitch.

1419
01:52:52,139 --> 01:52:54,576
Amazing people like that
actually exist, isn't it?

1420
01:52:54,609 --> 01:52:57,278
Who was she with? Remind me.

1421
01:52:57,311 --> 01:53:00,147
<i>The New York Times,</i>
Style section.

1422
01:53:00,180 --> 01:53:01,181
Thank God for that.

1423
01:53:01,215 --> 01:53:03,083
I thought you were going
to say <i>The Guardian.</i>

1424
01:53:03,117 --> 01:53:04,519
I told Hamid
to lock the place up,

1425
01:53:04,552 --> 01:53:06,253
outer gates and everything.

1426
01:53:07,254 --> 01:53:10,824
- Why'd you do that?
- Just to be on the safe side.

1427
01:53:13,628 --> 01:53:18,566
(♪♪♪)

1428
01:53:26,040 --> 01:53:29,443
- We need to talk.
- No we don't.

1429
01:53:32,346 --> 01:53:35,082
- Excuse me?
- We don't need to talk.

1430
01:53:35,115 --> 01:53:36,450
Nobody needs to talk.

1431
01:53:37,519 --> 01:53:39,587
We can choose to talk
or not talk.

1432
01:53:39,621 --> 01:53:41,989
Which I can assume
you're choosing not to talk.

1433
01:53:42,022 --> 01:53:43,357
Your assumption is correct.

1434
01:53:47,961 --> 01:53:49,721
You don't even want
to talk about your shirt?

1435
01:53:58,138 --> 01:54:01,408
- God, I hate Lou Reed.
- It's Velvet Underground.

1436
01:54:01,442 --> 01:54:03,010
How can you hate Lou Reed?

1437
01:54:07,348 --> 01:54:10,317
- I think we should stop.
- JO: What? Why?

1438
01:54:10,351 --> 01:54:13,220
It's where we hit him, Driss.

1439
01:54:13,253 --> 01:54:15,489
I think we should stop
and pay our respects.

1440
01:54:19,460 --> 01:54:20,700
JO:
There's someone in the road.

1441
01:54:32,707 --> 01:54:34,208
No, don't get out of the car.

1442
01:54:43,484 --> 01:54:44,619
David?

1443
01:54:57,464 --> 01:54:58,566
David.

1444
01:55:09,711 --> 01:55:11,011
Abdellah sent you.

1445
01:55:17,084 --> 01:55:18,118
(GASPS) David!

1446
01:55:20,020 --> 01:55:22,098
- It's all right. It's all right.
- It's not... It's not all right.

1447
01:55:22,122 --> 01:55:23,257
It's a fucking carjacking.

1448
01:55:26,628 --> 01:55:28,095
It's not a carjacking.

1449
01:55:33,066 --> 01:55:34,401
- Don't!
- Do it.

1450
01:55:35,335 --> 01:55:37,337
No, David.

1451
01:55:42,242 --> 01:55:44,546
- Do it.
- David!

1452
01:55:47,114 --> 01:55:48,081
Do it!

1453
01:55:48,115 --> 01:55:49,651
(GUNSHOT)

1454
01:55:49,684 --> 01:55:50,951
(GASPS)

1455
01:55:59,561 --> 01:56:01,729
(GASPING)

1456
01:56:03,765 --> 01:56:06,300
