1
00:00:31,821 --> 00:00:33,812
Earth, the Eagle has landed.

2
00:00:40,421 --> 00:00:44,016
Thanks to all of you, and now it's
on to Chicago and let's win there.

3
00:00:44,221 --> 00:00:45,336
Thank you very much.

4
00:00:53,941 --> 00:00:56,978
That day when all of God's children,
black men and white men,

5
00:00:57,181 --> 00:00:59,012
will be able to join hands

6
00:00:59,261 --> 00:01:02,253
and sing in the words
of the old negro spirituals.

7
00:01:02,461 --> 00:01:03,337
''Free at last.''

8
00:01:03,541 --> 00:01:04,769
''Free at last.''

9
00:01:04,981 --> 00:01:07,017
''Praise God almighty,
we're free at last.''

10
00:01:25,101 --> 00:01:26,693
The negro will be serving notice

11
00:01:26,941 --> 00:01:29,535
that no longer does he believe
in turning the other cheek

12
00:01:29,741 --> 00:01:32,699
and being a constant victim
of someone else's brutality.

13
00:01:34,821 --> 00:01:36,140
We believe

14
00:01:36,781 --> 00:01:38,612
that peace is at hand.

15
00:01:39,341 --> 00:01:40,217
We believe that

16
00:01:42,741 --> 00:01:44,254
an agreement

17
00:01:44,501 --> 00:01:45,377
is within sight.

18
00:02:16,581 --> 00:02:18,537
l heard you were back, Michael.

19
00:02:18,781 --> 00:02:20,339
Yes, sir, Mr. McKearney. l am.

20
00:02:20,661 --> 00:02:23,937
-About the same length?
-Take a little more off.

21
00:02:24,141 --> 00:02:26,735
Buzz? Brush? Number one?

22
00:02:26,941 --> 00:02:29,136
-How close is a number one?
-About there.

23
00:02:30,021 --> 00:02:33,297
How about just above the collar
and let me see my ears.

24
00:02:35,461 --> 00:02:37,656
What are you doing
with yourself now?

25
00:02:37,981 --> 00:02:40,290
ln about an hour
l'm starting work at the Factory.

26
00:02:40,501 --> 00:02:42,457
Going into the family business?

27
00:02:42,941 --> 00:02:44,613
Yes, sir. l guess l am.

28
00:04:23,621 --> 00:04:26,260
-Name, please.
-Smith. l start work today.

29
00:05:10,741 --> 00:05:13,778
...two, three, four. Halt!

30
00:05:14,901 --> 00:05:16,937
Right face!

31
00:05:18,741 --> 00:05:20,299
Right...

32
00:05:21,381 --> 00:05:22,177
face!

33
00:05:31,341 --> 00:05:33,536
To the right. Follow him.

34
00:05:41,541 --> 00:05:42,860
Well, well.

35
00:06:09,461 --> 00:06:10,814
Step forward.

36
00:06:11,981 --> 00:06:13,300
Raise your arms.

37
00:06:14,821 --> 00:06:16,300
Hands toward me.

38
00:06:17,701 --> 00:06:19,020
Raise your palms.

39
00:06:19,941 --> 00:06:21,420
Back at your sides.

40
00:06:22,141 --> 00:06:23,415
Open your mouth.

41
00:06:23,981 --> 00:06:25,255
Lift up your tongue.

42
00:06:26,021 --> 00:06:27,454
Bring your head forward.

43
00:06:28,261 --> 00:06:31,094
Turn your heads to the left.
My left.

44
00:06:32,661 --> 00:06:34,060
Other side.

45
00:06:35,341 --> 00:06:37,218
Tip your head forward.

46
00:06:38,101 --> 00:06:39,614
Shake out your hair.

47
00:06:40,421 --> 00:06:41,934
Wise guy.

48
00:06:42,381 --> 00:06:44,178
Lift up your balls.

49
00:06:46,901 --> 00:06:48,175
Turn around, face the wall.

50
00:06:49,981 --> 00:06:51,892
Lift up your right leg.

51
00:06:52,101 --> 00:06:53,739
Wiggle your toes.

52
00:06:53,981 --> 00:06:55,812
Lift up your left leg.

53
00:06:56,061 --> 00:06:57,540
Wiggle your toes.

54
00:06:58,381 --> 00:06:59,575
Bend over.

55
00:07:00,181 --> 00:07:01,694
Bend over further.

56
00:07:02,341 --> 00:07:03,820
Spread your cheeks.

57
00:07:04,221 --> 00:07:05,051
Cough.

58
00:07:12,581 --> 00:07:14,060
Command attitude.

59
00:07:22,541 --> 00:07:24,213
Go get 'em, tiger.

60
00:07:26,661 --> 00:07:29,050
l've used mine twice in 5 years.

61
00:07:30,061 --> 00:07:32,336
About the same number of times
l've used this.

62
00:07:35,101 --> 00:07:35,817
Ken Frates.

63
00:07:36,341 --> 00:07:38,332
-Mike Smith.
-Nice to meet you.

64
00:07:38,581 --> 00:07:40,651
Heard you just signed
your life away, Mikey.

65
00:07:40,861 --> 00:07:41,691
Hey, uncle Ed.

66
00:07:41,901 --> 00:07:44,540
l volunteered this shift
to show you around.

67
00:07:44,741 --> 00:07:47,619
Who the hell did that to you?
That ain't a haircut,

68
00:07:47,861 --> 00:07:50,295
that's assault with a deadly weapon.
Come on, let's go.

69
00:07:50,781 --> 00:07:53,420
Remember, we're all
doing time here, tiger.

70
00:07:53,661 --> 00:07:57,131
Only difference is, we're doing
ours on the installment plan.

71
00:07:57,541 --> 00:07:59,611
Come on, pick it up, let's go.

72
00:08:00,701 --> 00:08:01,690
Hold it up.

73
00:08:05,821 --> 00:08:07,015
Open the gate.

74
00:08:07,741 --> 00:08:09,857
l hear you're gonna be a father.

75
00:08:11,141 --> 00:08:13,257
You talk to my pop?

76
00:08:13,461 --> 00:08:18,012
Responsibility, Mikey. That's what
it's all about, responsibility.

77
00:08:34,661 --> 00:08:37,334
Yes, lieutenant.
Ten minutes, sir.

78
00:08:38,101 --> 00:08:39,170
Yes, sir.

79
00:08:42,261 --> 00:08:43,899
Got some film for me?

80
00:08:44,501 --> 00:08:47,299
You play your cards right and
l'll put you in that little number.

81
00:08:51,061 --> 00:08:52,380
Here you go.

82
00:08:53,661 --> 00:08:54,730
Bishop!

83
00:08:58,701 --> 00:09:00,453
Toes on the line.

84
00:09:02,341 --> 00:09:05,538
So is this some kind of
a vacation thing for you

85
00:09:05,741 --> 00:09:07,971
until something you really
wanna do comes along?

86
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,218
No, uncle Ed, this is it.
l really want this to work.

87
00:09:11,581 --> 00:09:14,300
l been waiting to hear you
say that for a long time.

88
00:09:15,261 --> 00:09:16,694
One thing now.

89
00:09:17,061 --> 00:09:20,576
ln here not so much of that
uncle Ed stuff, okay?

90
00:09:20,861 --> 00:09:21,976
Okay.

91
00:09:25,901 --> 00:09:28,620
This is Times Square.
Where everything comes together.

92
00:09:28,861 --> 00:09:31,853
A block, B block,
C block, D block.

93
00:09:32,061 --> 00:09:34,814
Administration,
exercise yard, armory,

94
00:09:35,021 --> 00:09:36,659
hospital, morgue.

95
00:09:42,741 --> 00:09:45,301
For all of you who just arrived,

96
00:09:45,581 --> 00:09:48,653
here's a few rules of conduct
that might

97
00:09:49,381 --> 00:09:53,169
make your stay here
a little more pleasant,

98
00:09:53,461 --> 00:09:55,770
and ours as well.

99
00:09:55,981 --> 00:09:58,336
For instance, this

100
00:09:59,141 --> 00:10:01,575
is not state-issued.

101
00:10:01,941 --> 00:10:04,694
Nor this, nor this.

102
00:10:05,541 --> 00:10:08,692
The laundry will only launder

103
00:10:08,901 --> 00:10:11,893
state-issued underwear.
Copy that?

104
00:10:12,141 --> 00:10:14,496
We wash one shirt

105
00:10:14,701 --> 00:10:16,976
and one pair of pants

106
00:10:17,301 --> 00:10:19,690
per man per week.

107
00:10:19,981 --> 00:10:24,497
Plus one set of
regulation underwear.

108
00:10:24,941 --> 00:10:28,013
l repeat, we do not launder

109
00:10:28,821 --> 00:10:32,336
personal underwear or socks.

110
00:10:32,541 --> 00:10:34,338
-Why?
-Who said that?

111
00:10:39,301 --> 00:10:41,098
Well, well.

112
00:10:42,501 --> 00:10:44,378
Look who's here.

113
00:10:45,741 --> 00:10:49,529
Some people like us so much
they just keep coming back.

114
00:10:50,341 --> 00:10:52,571
What is your question?

115
00:10:52,981 --> 00:10:54,937
What if the socks
are state-issued?

116
00:10:55,141 --> 00:10:58,338
No socks in any circumstances!

117
00:10:58,621 --> 00:11:00,657
You wanna wash your socks,

118
00:11:00,861 --> 00:11:03,659
buy yourself a plastic bucket
from the commisary.

119
00:11:03,901 --> 00:11:05,732
-Why we got to do that?
-Why?

120
00:11:05,981 --> 00:11:08,176
Because that's how it is.

121
00:11:08,381 --> 00:11:10,178
That's how we do it here.

122
00:11:10,381 --> 00:11:13,930
-Why is that how you do it here?
-That's how we always done it!

123
00:11:14,221 --> 00:11:16,337
Because those

124
00:11:16,541 --> 00:11:18,372
are the regulations

125
00:11:18,581 --> 00:11:22,460
and we aren't about
to change them for you!

126
00:11:22,741 --> 00:11:24,174
ls that clear?

127
00:11:24,381 --> 00:11:26,736
ls that crystal clear?

128
00:11:27,021 --> 00:11:30,093
All right, back in line.
Back in line!

129
00:11:33,861 --> 00:11:35,419
There is a door

130
00:11:36,341 --> 00:11:38,696
at the end of that corridor

131
00:11:39,381 --> 00:11:41,656
and it leads to an elevator.

132
00:11:42,181 --> 00:11:45,810
And the elevator leads
to the isolater units,

133
00:11:46,021 --> 00:11:48,091
where we put people

134
00:11:48,301 --> 00:11:50,974
who keep asking ''why?''.

135
00:11:52,581 --> 00:11:55,254
And you don't wanna go
through that door,

136
00:11:55,461 --> 00:11:56,894
l promise you,

137
00:11:57,141 --> 00:11:59,575
because the isolater unit

138
00:11:59,821 --> 00:12:02,779
is about the most unpleasant
place to be

139
00:12:02,981 --> 00:12:06,337
in the United States of America.

140
00:12:06,621 --> 00:12:09,181
Understand? Dig it?
Comprende?

141
00:12:09,381 --> 00:12:10,973
Capisce?

142
00:12:13,861 --> 00:12:17,251
You've all been assigned
cell numbers.

143
00:12:17,861 --> 00:12:19,579
Any questions,

144
00:12:19,821 --> 00:12:21,891
ask Mr. Motormouth.

145
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:24,336
He knows the routine.

146
00:12:24,701 --> 00:12:26,453
Yo, Gates!

147
00:12:26,861 --> 00:12:28,613
Move 'em out,

148
00:12:28,821 --> 00:12:32,894
and keep a special eye
on Mr. Motormouth.

149
00:12:33,261 --> 00:12:35,058
Count 'em off!

150
00:12:35,461 --> 00:12:37,053
-One!
-Two!

151
00:12:37,261 --> 00:12:41,413
Correctional services are going
to hell, Mikey. And that's a fact.

152
00:12:41,661 --> 00:12:43,538
Time was they knew their place.

153
00:12:43,741 --> 00:12:45,891
And we got on with our job.

154
00:12:46,421 --> 00:12:48,571
Now they been watching
all that sex,

155
00:12:48,821 --> 00:12:52,177
free love and violence out there
and they want some too.

156
00:12:52,821 --> 00:12:56,177
There's a very bad element
getting into prison these days.

157
00:12:56,381 --> 00:12:58,178
Ready for the showers, Leroy?

158
00:12:58,381 --> 00:13:01,418
Lieutenant Weisbad,
this is Hal Smith's son.

159
00:13:01,621 --> 00:13:03,179
-Michael, right?
-Yes, sir.

160
00:13:03,621 --> 00:13:05,373
Welcome aboard, Mike.

161
00:13:05,581 --> 00:13:08,175
How's your dad like retirement?
Fishing good?

162
00:13:08,381 --> 00:13:11,214
Not much fishing,
the bar keeps him pretty busy.

163
00:13:11,741 --> 00:13:15,700
You're gonna have to be a pretty
big man to walk in Hal's sneakers.

164
00:13:15,901 --> 00:13:18,096
-l'll do my best.
-Okay, Mike.

165
00:13:18,781 --> 00:13:20,897
Here's your first assignment.

166
00:13:21,101 --> 00:13:25,458
Every resident here is required
to take one shower per week.

167
00:13:25,661 --> 00:13:28,733
These are yours.
Go shower them.

168
00:13:28,981 --> 00:13:31,575
-Now?
-Right now. Why not?

169
00:13:32,341 --> 00:13:35,458
Well, l just got here. l haven't
gone through the training program.

170
00:13:35,901 --> 00:13:38,415
Mike, this is
the training program.

171
00:14:09,461 --> 00:14:10,735
What are you gonna do
when you get out?

172
00:14:26,141 --> 00:14:28,655
All right, men. Forward march.

173
00:14:31,221 --> 00:14:32,370
Let's go.

174
00:14:32,821 --> 00:14:34,379
Come on, move it out.
Let's go.

175
00:14:35,301 --> 00:14:36,051
Come on.

176
00:14:37,221 --> 00:14:39,496
Come on, let's move it out.
Come on.

177
00:14:43,621 --> 00:14:44,417
Problem?

178
00:14:45,621 --> 00:14:48,374
-Yeah, they won't move.
-You gotta use your stick.

179
00:14:48,621 --> 00:14:51,658
There's no verbal communication
between officers and inmates.

180
00:14:51,861 --> 00:14:53,294
Those are Attica rules.

181
00:14:56,461 --> 00:14:58,019
One to go, two to stop.

182
00:14:58,341 --> 00:15:00,855
l'm Willis. You're the new guy,
Smith, right?

183
00:15:01,661 --> 00:15:03,538
You'll get the hang of this shit
soon enough.

184
00:15:03,781 --> 00:15:06,739
lf you're warm-blooded, can sign
your name and add, this is easy.

185
00:15:06,941 --> 00:15:08,374
And there's always overtime.

186
00:15:08,981 --> 00:15:11,176
Hardly takes a rocket scientist
to do this job.

187
00:15:11,381 --> 00:15:13,133
What would you and me
be doing here?

188
00:15:14,021 --> 00:15:17,013
Better get after your group.
Probably at the main gate by now.

189
00:15:17,221 --> 00:15:18,097
Thanks.

190
00:15:20,741 --> 00:15:23,096
Hey! Hold it up!
Come on, stop!

191
00:15:23,541 --> 00:15:24,496
Come on!

192
00:15:31,741 --> 00:15:32,856
Good.

193
00:15:33,341 --> 00:15:35,616
Any of you guys know how
to get back to the cell block?

194
00:15:56,941 --> 00:15:58,420
Hey, barkeep!

195
00:15:58,781 --> 00:16:01,011
-Get me a drink.
-You got lD?

196
00:16:01,901 --> 00:16:02,856
Yeah.

197
00:16:03,101 --> 00:16:05,296
That's me, right there.

198
00:16:06,381 --> 00:16:08,690
How about a whisky and a beer
in a dirty glass.

199
00:16:08,941 --> 00:16:10,579
Oh, tough guy, huh?

200
00:16:11,141 --> 00:16:14,258
How about l do a tap dance on
your head with that bat over there?

201
00:16:15,261 --> 00:16:16,819
Show him what you got.

202
00:16:21,461 --> 00:16:22,655
Hey, no problem.

203
00:16:23,061 --> 00:16:23,811
Punks.

204
00:16:24,341 --> 00:16:25,376
Hi, pop.

205
00:16:25,581 --> 00:16:27,014
Hi, son.

206
00:16:27,901 --> 00:16:29,334
So how'd it go?

207
00:16:32,461 --> 00:16:34,099
First day, you know.

208
00:16:34,301 --> 00:16:35,529
Yeah.

209
00:16:38,381 --> 00:16:41,293
l'll be right back.
l wanna hear all about it.

210
00:16:43,501 --> 00:16:45,014
Man, you look beat.

211
00:16:45,421 --> 00:16:47,571
l'll tell you, it ain't like
anything l thought it would be.

212
00:16:48,101 --> 00:16:50,661
Your old man had 25 years
in that place.

213
00:16:50,861 --> 00:16:52,692
He never talked about it
when he came home.

214
00:16:54,141 --> 00:16:55,540
What's the deal in there?

215
00:16:55,781 --> 00:16:57,055
Can we talk about something else?

216
00:16:58,021 --> 00:16:59,136
Sure.

217
00:17:02,981 --> 00:17:04,255
Jess, look.

218
00:17:04,461 --> 00:17:07,851
lt's an easy eight you don't
have to be a rocket scientist

219
00:17:08,061 --> 00:17:10,939
and you'll probably get used to it.
ln about 150 years.

220
00:17:14,341 --> 00:17:17,139
So, you wanna tell me about it?

221
00:17:18,341 --> 00:17:20,332
l'll call you later,
Mike, all right?

222
00:17:20,541 --> 00:17:21,735
Thanks, Hal.

223
00:17:23,381 --> 00:17:25,292
Pop, l gotta be getting back.

224
00:17:26,341 --> 00:17:29,617
lt's quite a place,
the Factory, huh?

225
00:17:31,021 --> 00:17:32,454
Yeah, it sure is.

226
00:17:33,221 --> 00:17:34,859
Thanks for the drinks.

227
00:17:51,901 --> 00:17:53,857
Oh, my God! He's got ears!

228
00:17:54,461 --> 00:17:56,019
You never told me.

229
00:17:56,261 --> 00:17:57,740
You're gorgeous!

230
00:18:20,541 --> 00:18:23,260
How long are we gonna be able
to keep doing this?

231
00:18:24,021 --> 00:18:25,773
Months and months.

232
00:18:29,301 --> 00:18:30,734
You feel good.

233
00:18:45,981 --> 00:18:46,857
So...

234
00:18:48,821 --> 00:18:50,095
day one?

235
00:18:51,461 --> 00:18:54,658
Day one l just about organized
the biggest prison break

236
00:18:54,861 --> 00:18:57,295
in the history of the New York
penal system.

237
00:18:58,901 --> 00:19:01,734
l'm marching these 30 guys
out of the shower...

238
00:19:08,541 --> 00:19:12,250
l need just about the longest
shower l ever took.

239
00:19:32,981 --> 00:19:34,130
Thanks.

240
00:19:38,341 --> 00:19:40,935
Tell me about your day,
l'll tell you about mine.

241
00:19:41,581 --> 00:19:45,256
-You don't wanna know about it.
-Really? ls that why l'm asking?

242
00:19:46,621 --> 00:19:49,818
Well, it's a big noisy place
and there's lots of bad guys

243
00:19:50,021 --> 00:19:51,977
who don't wanna be there
and that's about it.

244
00:19:56,981 --> 00:19:58,812
Kodak is still taking people on.

245
00:19:59,021 --> 00:20:01,012
Sharon, we've been through that.

246
00:20:01,221 --> 00:20:03,257
You want to be a prison guard
the rest of your life?

247
00:20:04,101 --> 00:20:05,739
Corrections officer.

248
00:20:06,781 --> 00:20:08,612
Honey, is that what you wanna do
with the rest of your life?

249
00:20:09,941 --> 00:20:11,499
Nothing much else worked out,
did it?

250
00:20:21,301 --> 00:20:22,336
Yo, captain.

251
00:20:24,301 --> 00:20:25,416
l got a little problem here, sir.

252
00:20:26,461 --> 00:20:28,611
You're not supposed to talk to me,
l'm not supposed to talk to you.

253
00:20:29,021 --> 00:20:30,340
Yeah, but l got a situation, sir.

254
00:20:30,861 --> 00:20:31,611
You got a problem,

255
00:20:31,821 --> 00:20:33,334
take it up with the lieutenant.

256
00:20:33,541 --> 00:20:35,259
My toilet bowl's clogged up, sir.

257
00:20:35,461 --> 00:20:37,816
l'm in here 23 hours a day.

258
00:20:38,181 --> 00:20:39,933
l gotta do something about this.

259
00:20:41,941 --> 00:20:42,976
l didn't hear you.

260
00:20:43,181 --> 00:20:44,296
l missed my shower.

261
00:20:44,541 --> 00:20:46,532
No. You say you wish to report

262
00:20:46,741 --> 00:20:48,777
a hygiene deficiency situation.

263
00:20:50,101 --> 00:20:51,011
l can't here you.

264
00:20:51,221 --> 00:20:53,735
l wish to report
a hygiene deficiency situation.

265
00:20:53,941 --> 00:20:56,091
-Occasioned by?
-By the fact l was in the goddamn...

266
00:20:56,301 --> 00:20:58,337
You gotta say ''occasioned by''.

267
00:20:58,701 --> 00:21:02,216
l wish to report a hygiene
deficiency occasioned by...

268
00:21:02,421 --> 00:21:03,217
What is it?

269
00:21:03,421 --> 00:21:06,174
Got a problem on 31 ,
his toilet's backin up.

270
00:21:06,381 --> 00:21:08,531
l walk this tier, son.
There's nothing wrong here.

271
00:21:08,781 --> 00:21:10,578
Nobody's got a legitimate bitch

272
00:21:10,781 --> 00:21:11,896
unless l say so.

273
00:21:12,981 --> 00:21:14,653
lt smells pretty bad.

274
00:21:14,981 --> 00:21:18,690
We have an inmate trying to jerk
a new officer around, that's all.

275
00:21:19,581 --> 00:21:20,934
Yo, 31 !

276
00:21:21,181 --> 00:21:24,139
Waste any more of my officer's time
and your ass is gonna get clamped,

277
00:21:24,341 --> 00:21:25,490
big time!

278
00:21:26,541 --> 00:21:29,374
They do it on purpose.
They stuff their shirts in the can.

279
00:21:30,421 --> 00:21:31,934
Why would he do that?

280
00:21:32,341 --> 00:21:33,933
Because they're them, and we're us.

281
00:21:34,181 --> 00:21:37,617
Their job is to fidge us around
and ours is not to let them do that.

282
00:21:37,861 --> 00:21:40,136
Don't be getting into a debating
club with the inmates.

283
00:21:40,341 --> 00:21:42,616
lt's backing up
all over his floor, sir.

284
00:21:43,541 --> 00:21:46,931
Don't worry about him. You know
what he's in here for, don't you?

285
00:21:47,781 --> 00:21:50,454
No, l don't wanna know.
l just want to do my job.

286
00:21:50,661 --> 00:21:53,300
l can't see how knowing what he's in
here for is gonna make a difference.

287
00:22:24,141 --> 00:22:27,451
You fill out this job slip
for a blocked drain on C block?

288
00:22:30,301 --> 00:22:31,290
Yes, sir.

289
00:22:31,501 --> 00:22:34,573
Officer Yates says he told you
no action need be taken.

290
00:22:35,301 --> 00:22:37,940
-Mr. Ramirez's toilet was...
-Mr. Ramirez?

291
00:22:38,181 --> 00:22:40,536
You got a little bleeding heart
thing going on here, Smith?

292
00:22:40,781 --> 00:22:42,134
Sir, just trying to do my job.

293
00:22:42,341 --> 00:22:44,855
You haven't been here long enough
to know what your job is yet.

294
00:22:45,061 --> 00:22:48,371
l am negatively impressed by this
attitude. You like this attitude?

295
00:22:48,581 --> 00:22:51,175
-This is not a good attitude.
-You telling us how to walk a tier?

296
00:22:51,381 --> 00:22:52,370
-No, sir.
-Good.

297
00:22:52,581 --> 00:22:56,096
Let's see if your heart's in place
and how heavy your balls hang.

298
00:22:56,421 --> 00:22:58,616
Left, left, left...

299
00:22:58,861 --> 00:23:00,419
two, three, four.

300
00:23:00,661 --> 00:23:02,617
Bishop! On the floor.

301
00:23:07,301 --> 00:23:08,939
Track 24.

302
00:23:15,421 --> 00:23:16,854
You got some out of cell time,

303
00:23:17,061 --> 00:23:18,096
Mohamed.

304
00:23:18,821 --> 00:23:20,732
Smith, cuff him.

305
00:23:21,261 --> 00:23:22,091
Belt.

306
00:23:36,421 --> 00:23:37,331
Handcuffs.

307
00:23:47,421 --> 00:23:48,536
Ankles.

308
00:23:58,221 --> 00:23:59,290
Chain.

309
00:24:16,861 --> 00:24:19,091
Meet Billy Bishop,
from New York City.

310
00:24:19,381 --> 00:24:22,976
Jamaal X, political prisoner of
the white devils, freedom fighter,

311
00:24:23,181 --> 00:24:24,853
member of the black resistence,

312
00:24:25,061 --> 00:24:26,210
for liberation.

313
00:24:26,501 --> 00:24:30,016
The only thing you liberated was
your mother's fanny when you put her

314
00:24:30,221 --> 00:24:31,210
on the street to pay for your habit.

315
00:24:31,421 --> 00:24:33,412
Come on, don't be a panny.

316
00:24:33,621 --> 00:24:34,258
Try it.

317
00:24:36,381 --> 00:24:37,450
Come on.

318
00:24:41,021 --> 00:24:43,979
Here we go again. Another petition.

319
00:24:46,461 --> 00:24:47,735
Request denied.

320
00:24:47,981 --> 00:24:50,814
The rules on what the prison laundry
will accept are quite clear.

321
00:24:51,061 --> 00:24:52,130
How about the other demands?

322
00:24:53,381 --> 00:24:55,417
l need to know your response
to the Attica Liberation Movement's

323
00:24:55,621 --> 00:24:56,940
demands for better treatment.

324
00:24:57,141 --> 00:24:59,132
You do not make demands,

325
00:24:59,621 --> 00:25:02,419
and you do not circulate petitions
inside this facility.

326
00:25:02,981 --> 00:25:06,451
From now on, you will not
hold meetings in the yard

327
00:25:06,701 --> 00:25:08,214
and you will not wear a uniform.

328
00:25:08,421 --> 00:25:10,332
Grey pants and white shirts
are prison-issued.

329
00:25:10,541 --> 00:25:12,611
Not how you militants
and troublemakers wear them.

330
00:25:12,861 --> 00:25:14,931
We press our pants
and change our shirts

331
00:25:15,141 --> 00:25:16,256
when we can.

332
00:25:16,461 --> 00:25:18,770
You people are turning into
a problem again, my friend.

333
00:25:19,021 --> 00:25:20,898
How you gonna deal with the problem,
Mr. Superintendent?

334
00:25:21,101 --> 00:25:23,092
Keep us on the move
inside the system?

335
00:25:23,301 --> 00:25:27,374
Should you continue with your
subversive and disruptive behavior

336
00:25:27,821 --> 00:25:28,697
you will be subject

337
00:25:28,941 --> 00:25:30,533
to immediate transfer
to another prison.

338
00:25:30,781 --> 00:25:34,057
The effect will be like having your
nuts caught in a revolving door.

339
00:25:36,421 --> 00:25:38,616
We demand better food.

340
00:25:38,821 --> 00:25:40,732
We demand better medical facilities.

341
00:25:40,941 --> 00:25:43,171
We demand an end to censorship

342
00:25:43,381 --> 00:25:44,655
of inmate-attorney correspondence.

343
00:25:45,061 --> 00:25:48,451
We demand a right
to worship how we please.

344
00:25:48,661 --> 00:25:51,494
We demand a rehab system that works.

345
00:25:51,701 --> 00:25:54,499
We demand Spanish-speaking officers
for our Latino brothers.

346
00:25:54,701 --> 00:25:56,453
Latino brothers!

347
00:25:57,021 --> 00:26:00,980
You and the Puerto Ricans are
always trying to kill each other.

348
00:26:02,381 --> 00:26:05,179
Our solidarity scares you ''chain 'em
to the floor'' motherfuckers.

349
00:26:06,181 --> 00:26:09,617
You like us at each other's throats,
makes us easier to control.

350
00:26:10,541 --> 00:26:12,020
ls that it for today?

351
00:26:12,341 --> 00:26:14,901
You got anything else?
Anything new?

352
00:26:16,621 --> 00:26:18,737
You running out of time,
Mr. Superintendent.

353
00:26:21,741 --> 00:26:23,732
This is Attica.

354
00:26:24,701 --> 00:26:26,532
We're not gonna blink.

355
00:26:30,021 --> 00:26:31,454
Ten hut!

356
00:27:28,701 --> 00:27:30,817
Now tell him to drop 'em.

357
00:27:32,581 --> 00:27:33,491
Go on.

358
00:27:37,021 --> 00:27:38,056
Drop 'em.

359
00:27:47,421 --> 00:27:49,651
Now tell him to spread them.

360
00:27:50,701 --> 00:27:52,657
Tell him to spread them real wide,

361
00:27:52,981 --> 00:27:56,018
so wide we can see
the sun coming up.

362
00:27:58,421 --> 00:28:00,491
Do you have a problem with this,
officer Smith?

363
00:28:00,741 --> 00:28:02,538
Are your panties to tight?

364
00:28:03,141 --> 00:28:04,017
Spread 'em.

365
00:28:05,981 --> 00:28:07,300
Tell him wider.

366
00:28:08,021 --> 00:28:08,771
Wider.

367
00:28:11,221 --> 00:28:12,415
And again.

368
00:28:13,141 --> 00:28:14,051
Wider!

369
00:28:14,461 --> 00:28:16,213
You got a girlfriend, man?

370
00:28:16,541 --> 00:28:17,769
You got a family?

371
00:28:18,061 --> 00:28:19,972
You tell them you look up
people's asses all day?

372
00:28:20,221 --> 00:28:21,336
Turn around!

373
00:28:21,901 --> 00:28:25,291
Yates says you got a problem knowing
what these men are in here for.

374
00:28:25,501 --> 00:28:27,651
Maybe that's because
as long as you can tell yourself

375
00:28:27,861 --> 00:28:29,533
they're just men and not inmates

376
00:28:29,741 --> 00:28:32,892
you can also kid yourself
into believing you're not a guard.

377
00:28:33,501 --> 00:28:34,729
l said turn around!

378
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:39,371
You're wearing the blue now, son.
That makes you one of us.

379
00:28:39,581 --> 00:28:41,378
And there ain't no way around that.

380
00:28:49,541 --> 00:28:50,496
Mace him!

381
00:28:53,021 --> 00:28:54,295
ln his eyes!

382
00:28:54,661 --> 00:28:55,616
ln his eyes!

383
00:28:57,501 --> 00:28:58,729
Again!

384
00:29:02,421 --> 00:29:04,810
Okay, okay. Get him out of here.
Get him out.

385
00:29:09,661 --> 00:29:11,538
You did good, son.

386
00:29:11,941 --> 00:29:14,694
Lose one cell and we lose a tier.

387
00:29:14,901 --> 00:29:18,052
Lose the tiers,
and we've lost the yards.

388
00:29:18,261 --> 00:29:21,651
lf we lost the yards, lose the
yards, and we lose the prisons.

389
00:29:21,901 --> 00:29:25,257
Lose them, and we've lost America.

390
00:29:25,541 --> 00:29:26,690
Understand?

391
00:29:26,981 --> 00:29:29,654
We've got a civil war going on
in this country, son.

392
00:29:29,901 --> 00:29:32,859
This is where we're gonna
hold the line. You got it now?

393
00:30:33,341 --> 00:30:35,935
Not bad, huh?
Well done, Mike!

394
00:30:37,261 --> 00:30:39,013
He's got a pretty good voice.

395
00:30:39,381 --> 00:30:40,814
How the hell's he doing?

396
00:30:41,061 --> 00:30:44,337
l don't think Sinatra's worried, but
we can always use another baritone.

397
00:30:44,581 --> 00:30:46,651
l don't mean that,
l mean how's he doing on the job.

398
00:30:46,861 --> 00:30:50,615
He's got shoulders, he's got balls

399
00:30:50,941 --> 00:30:53,091
and he's learning
the right attitude.

400
00:30:53,381 --> 00:30:55,372
He's gonna be great!

401
00:30:55,661 --> 00:30:57,219
He lost his cherry.

402
00:30:59,141 --> 00:31:00,733
Give me another one, Ed.

403
00:31:03,661 --> 00:31:05,174
Hey, barkeep!

404
00:31:05,661 --> 00:31:07,538
Line me up, l'm ready to go.

405
00:31:10,741 --> 00:31:13,460
You've been hitting it pretty hard,
you think you ought to ease up?

406
00:31:13,701 --> 00:31:16,738
No, pop, this job you work up
a thirst. You should know.

407
00:31:19,301 --> 00:31:20,416
All right.

408
00:31:20,621 --> 00:31:23,579
l wanna tell you one thing, l'll ask
in a nice way, don't embarrass me

409
00:31:23,821 --> 00:31:25,812
or Sharon, all right?

410
00:31:36,021 --> 00:31:38,455
Hi, honey. How you doing?
You having a good time?

411
00:31:38,941 --> 00:31:40,135
Cut it out!

412
00:31:42,341 --> 00:31:44,696
What does that mean,
you lost your cherry?

413
00:31:45,381 --> 00:31:48,896
lt means there was some trouble in
the tiers today and l got involved.

414
00:31:49,101 --> 00:31:50,420
Got involved, how?

415
00:31:50,621 --> 00:31:52,020
l maced a P.R.

416
00:31:52,221 --> 00:31:55,213
He was struggling and l was there
and it's what l get paid for.

417
00:31:55,421 --> 00:31:57,935
-You maced a P.R.?
-A Puerto Rican.

418
00:31:59,141 --> 00:32:03,373
-You don't have to know about this.
-That's not good enough for me.

419
00:32:04,221 --> 00:32:06,451
lt's not me.
l didn't grow up here

420
00:32:06,661 --> 00:32:09,653
and l didn't grow up expecting
to be the wife of a prison guard.

421
00:32:09,941 --> 00:32:11,499
That's too bad, isn't it?

422
00:32:11,701 --> 00:32:13,771
You know something? lt is too bad.

423
00:32:17,621 --> 00:32:19,179
-Where are you going?
-Home.

424
00:32:19,581 --> 00:32:21,697
Honey, this is upstate New York.

425
00:32:21,901 --> 00:32:25,337
We hunt, we fish, we drink and lock
people up for the rest of the state.

426
00:32:25,621 --> 00:32:27,737
You're changing.
They're doing something to you.

427
00:32:27,941 --> 00:32:30,136
This isn't another job.

428
00:32:30,381 --> 00:32:32,178
l put my life in those guys' hands
every day.

429
00:32:32,381 --> 00:32:35,418
And you don't talk about it to your
wives, especially not to your wives.

430
00:32:35,621 --> 00:32:38,579
They're taking you away from me.
l want you back. Don't give up...

431
00:32:38,861 --> 00:32:42,410
l'm not giving up on this marriage.
l'm making money, l'm working.

432
00:32:42,661 --> 00:32:44,174
For you and for him.

433
00:32:45,181 --> 00:32:47,570
lf you weren't having this baby we
wouldn't be having this discussion.

434
00:32:47,821 --> 00:32:49,539
But that's not the way it is,
is it?

435
00:32:49,781 --> 00:32:51,772
l just don't wanna talk
about it now, Sharon.

436
00:32:57,261 --> 00:32:58,171
Don't go.

437
00:33:11,901 --> 00:33:14,051
Look here. Contraband.

438
00:33:14,941 --> 00:33:16,499
l got a bad gut.

439
00:33:16,701 --> 00:33:18,771
l can't eat that shit that y'all.

440
00:33:22,861 --> 00:33:24,852
That's an illegal device there.

441
00:33:26,461 --> 00:33:29,055
Now why does the commisary
sell cans of soup

442
00:33:29,341 --> 00:33:30,171
if you can't

443
00:33:30,381 --> 00:33:31,291
heat the shit up?

444
00:33:31,501 --> 00:33:33,298
Guess that's one of the mysteries
of the penal system.

445
00:33:35,341 --> 00:33:37,332
You gonna walk to the hole
or we gonna have to carry you?

446
00:33:38,381 --> 00:33:39,257
Fuck you.

447
00:33:42,381 --> 00:33:44,975
l'll burn your ass, motherfucker!
l want hot!

448
00:33:45,341 --> 00:33:48,458
l want hot soup! Hot soup!

449
00:33:48,701 --> 00:33:50,896
You got it, motherfucker?
Hot soup!

450
00:33:53,421 --> 00:33:55,139
Hot soup! Hot soup!

451
00:33:55,421 --> 00:33:57,218
Bring your fucking ass over here!

452
00:33:59,941 --> 00:34:01,932
Leave my man alone!

453
00:34:11,301 --> 00:34:13,690
Watch your asses in here today,
gentlemen.

454
00:34:13,981 --> 00:34:17,337
Some clown tried to brain officer
Yates with a can of soup.

455
00:34:17,541 --> 00:34:21,250
When we tried to grab the perp in
the yard we damn near had a riot.

456
00:34:21,781 --> 00:34:25,296
Smith is gonna lift him on his way
out of chow hall with a snatch team.

457
00:34:25,741 --> 00:34:28,733
First sign of any trouble,
we go to general lockdown.

458
00:34:29,021 --> 00:34:31,899
So stay cocked, locked
and ready to rock.

459
00:34:32,741 --> 00:34:34,015
Question, lieutenant.

460
00:34:36,021 --> 00:34:36,771
What kind of soup?

461
00:34:37,021 --> 00:34:39,615
Tomato, condensed.
ls that important?

462
00:34:40,261 --> 00:34:41,296
Details.

463
00:34:42,741 --> 00:34:44,060
l like details.

464
00:34:45,021 --> 00:34:45,897
Right.

465
00:34:57,341 --> 00:34:59,297
So what do we do
if there's any trouble?

466
00:34:59,941 --> 00:35:02,694
Procedure is cover your balls
and run for the walls.

467
00:35:03,541 --> 00:35:04,337
That's it?

468
00:35:05,141 --> 00:35:06,733
Don't you get it yet?

469
00:35:07,221 --> 00:35:08,939
We don't run this place.
They do.

470
00:35:09,141 --> 00:35:11,291
We feed them, water them,
make sure the roof don't leak.

471
00:35:11,861 --> 00:35:14,329
Any time they wanna
take this place over,

472
00:35:15,341 --> 00:35:17,571
we got 30 seconds
to hit the street.

473
00:35:33,621 --> 00:35:35,612
You told Willis what's going down?

474
00:35:35,821 --> 00:35:37,459
No, hell no. l thought you did.

475
00:35:38,301 --> 00:35:40,531
Jesus. The Attica Follies.

476
00:35:41,221 --> 00:35:44,531
Let's go. Willis doesn't have
a clue what's going on.

477
00:36:01,381 --> 00:36:02,734
Hey, Willis!
Open the fucking door.

478
00:36:03,381 --> 00:36:04,973
-What's going on?
-lf l miss my shower

479
00:36:05,181 --> 00:36:06,773
-l'm gonna be pissed, motherfucker!
-To the right.

480
00:36:06,981 --> 00:36:07,697
Come on!

481
00:36:11,941 --> 00:36:13,260
Motherfucker!

482
00:36:23,381 --> 00:36:24,131
Shit!

483
00:36:41,741 --> 00:36:44,892
Hot soup, motherfucker!
Hot soup!

484
00:37:09,541 --> 00:37:12,817
Go on, kick his ass.
Get the keys.

485
00:37:17,181 --> 00:37:20,059
l got 40,000 Zulus coming down the
corridor, coming right for you!

486
00:37:20,421 --> 00:37:22,810
Bring the pigs! Bring the pigs!

487
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:24,410
Bring 'em all!

488
00:38:04,741 --> 00:38:06,094
Sir, we have an inmate

489
00:38:06,301 --> 00:38:07,734
control problem.
Your officers are down.

490
00:38:07,941 --> 00:38:09,135
Request permission to use fire.

491
00:38:09,341 --> 00:38:10,456
Affirmative.

492
00:38:10,701 --> 00:38:12,419
ls this it? The big one?

493
00:38:12,621 --> 00:38:14,691
Negative. We have it contained.

494
00:38:15,021 --> 00:38:16,534
Armory? Weisbad.

495
00:38:18,461 --> 00:38:19,940
We're gonna take it over!

496
00:38:57,461 --> 00:38:58,655
Get the fucking keys!

497
00:38:58,901 --> 00:38:59,777
The keys!

498
00:39:04,421 --> 00:39:05,900
Come on! Come on!

499
00:39:21,981 --> 00:39:24,859
Get that motherfucker!
Get him!

500
00:39:25,101 --> 00:39:28,650
Over there! Get him!
Get his fucking keys! Get him!

501
00:39:29,621 --> 00:39:32,260
Come on! Come on! Come on!

502
00:39:57,501 --> 00:39:59,378
We're getting it on, baby!

503
00:40:00,461 --> 00:40:02,895
We even gonna free
white boys today.

504
00:40:19,381 --> 00:40:22,612
Red alert.
This is not a drill.

505
00:40:22,861 --> 00:40:24,294
Repeat. This is not a drill.

506
00:40:28,741 --> 00:40:30,299
We got it! Let's go!

507
00:40:30,541 --> 00:40:33,613
Come on, baby!
Get out of your cell!

508
00:40:33,821 --> 00:40:36,176
Come on!
Get out your damn cells!

509
00:40:47,421 --> 00:40:48,251
Hey, get off!

510
00:41:03,501 --> 00:41:05,378
Get back! Hold your fire!

511
00:41:41,101 --> 00:41:42,773
Come on, man.
We getting out.

512
00:41:45,021 --> 00:41:46,932
Don't move. Don't move.

513
00:41:47,301 --> 00:41:48,859
You ratted me to them.

514
00:41:49,061 --> 00:41:51,575
Stand up. Be a man.

515
00:41:51,861 --> 00:41:54,375
You ratted me,
you squealing motherfucker!

516
00:42:01,501 --> 00:42:02,377
Fall!

517
00:42:03,701 --> 00:42:05,214
Get down.

518
00:42:08,061 --> 00:42:09,972
Let it burn!

519
00:42:15,061 --> 00:42:16,619
What's going on?

520
00:42:17,981 --> 00:42:20,290
Look out the window.
They got guns.

521
00:42:21,821 --> 00:42:22,810
lt's a riot!

522
00:42:25,141 --> 00:42:27,291
Mr. Smith,
what the fuck is going on?

523
00:42:44,901 --> 00:42:46,334
Don't do it, man.
School's out.

524
00:42:46,661 --> 00:42:47,889
Give me the keys!

525
00:42:48,141 --> 00:42:49,540
Give me the fucking keys!

526
00:43:02,501 --> 00:43:04,298
Give him to me! l've got him!

527
00:43:05,061 --> 00:43:07,780
l've got him! l've got him.

528
00:43:08,581 --> 00:43:11,891
Stay down! Just stay down!
Keep your head down!

529
00:43:21,221 --> 00:43:22,700
l'm finishing a chart.

530
00:43:23,421 --> 00:43:27,209
Oh, yeah? l'm gonna finish your ass
if you don't come out of that cell.

531
00:43:30,541 --> 00:43:31,291
My books!

532
00:43:32,221 --> 00:43:33,131
Shit!

533
00:43:45,701 --> 00:43:47,657
Open it. Open it!

534
00:43:48,261 --> 00:43:49,580
Open the door, Mr. Yates!

535
00:43:49,861 --> 00:43:50,657
Open the door, Mr. Yates!

536
00:44:03,541 --> 00:44:04,735
Go on, go on!

537
00:44:06,301 --> 00:44:08,337
Fuck 'em up! Do it, do it!

538
00:44:14,741 --> 00:44:17,938
l want you guys to keep your heads!
We gotta organize!

539
00:44:18,141 --> 00:44:20,211
Get everybody out of here,
get them in the yard!

540
00:44:20,421 --> 00:44:23,254
Meet me at the door in one minute!
Be back here!

541
00:44:52,941 --> 00:44:55,330
We've got to go, sir.
We've got to go now.

542
00:44:55,741 --> 00:44:58,130
They've taken D block. l don't know
if we can hold the rest.

543
00:45:01,181 --> 00:45:03,376
Fuck him up! Fuck him up!

544
00:45:08,581 --> 00:45:11,254
Fuck him up! Fuck him up!

545
00:45:11,781 --> 00:45:13,134
Fuck him up!

546
00:45:29,701 --> 00:45:31,293
Get off him. Get off!

547
00:45:31,501 --> 00:45:33,014
Yo, look! We gotta stop this shit.

548
00:45:33,541 --> 00:45:36,817
-What the fuck is your problem?
-We need these pigs.

549
00:45:37,021 --> 00:45:37,817
Not me.

550
00:45:38,421 --> 00:45:40,730
What else we got
to negotiate with?

551
00:45:45,821 --> 00:45:47,413
Are the walls secure?

552
00:45:51,621 --> 00:45:54,010
ls this thing contained yet?

553
00:45:54,541 --> 00:45:57,419
lt's being contained, sir.
We've stopped them at the gate.

554
00:46:00,541 --> 00:46:02,691
Sound the powerhouse whistle.

555
00:46:28,141 --> 00:46:29,494
We got it.

556
00:46:30,061 --> 00:46:31,289
We got the prison.

557
00:46:38,701 --> 00:46:39,975
We lost it.

558
00:46:41,941 --> 00:46:43,374
We lost Attica.

559
00:46:44,141 --> 00:46:46,974
Damn, man.
l only had two more weeks left.

560
00:46:47,181 --> 00:46:49,934
Greedy motherfuckers!
Stop eating!

561
00:46:50,341 --> 00:46:52,491
Get the shit over there
to the kitchen!

562
00:46:52,701 --> 00:46:54,134
We got to share!

563
00:47:53,461 --> 00:47:55,452
Salaam Alekum, brother.

564
00:47:55,661 --> 00:47:57,333
Alekum Salaam.

565
00:48:00,821 --> 00:48:03,858
l think you need to get over here.
This guy's bad off.

566
00:48:10,021 --> 00:48:11,932
Take a look at officer Willis.

567
00:48:12,141 --> 00:48:15,019
He got piped real bad.
They busted him up good.

568
00:48:26,421 --> 00:48:28,889
Let's go. We gotta talk to the man.

569
00:48:39,061 --> 00:48:40,096
We want our men

570
00:48:40,301 --> 00:48:40,972
out.

571
00:48:41,181 --> 00:48:42,250
Come and get them!

572
00:48:42,461 --> 00:48:44,975
Give us one. Just one.

573
00:48:45,741 --> 00:48:49,131
We'll give you food, water,
medical supplies.

574
00:48:51,701 --> 00:48:54,135
We'll give you one.
That's all you get.

575
00:48:59,581 --> 00:49:01,139
They ain't coming in.

576
00:49:02,021 --> 00:49:03,818
The man just blinked.

577
00:49:09,181 --> 00:49:10,500
You know where you are, man?

578
00:49:12,421 --> 00:49:13,934
You're in Athens.

579
00:49:14,381 --> 00:49:16,292
Athens, Greece.
3,000 years ago.

580
00:49:16,821 --> 00:49:19,335
The birthplace of democracy.
Every few years,

581
00:49:19,541 --> 00:49:21,657
the rays converge

582
00:49:22,021 --> 00:49:23,932
and the planet gets another chance.

583
00:49:24,381 --> 00:49:26,417
l used to think it was Woodstock.

584
00:49:26,741 --> 00:49:28,652
But it's here, in Attica.

585
00:49:29,701 --> 00:49:30,611
ls that so?

586
00:49:30,821 --> 00:49:33,289
Have you ever heard of Spartacus?

587
00:49:34,061 --> 00:49:35,176
This is it.

588
00:49:35,621 --> 00:49:37,452
This is one of the great
slave revolts.

589
00:49:37,661 --> 00:49:39,811
Nothing's gonna be the same
after this.

590
00:49:41,981 --> 00:49:43,130
You want me to stitch that up?

591
00:49:44,621 --> 00:49:45,849
lt's okay.

592
00:49:46,101 --> 00:49:47,011
You sure?

593
00:49:52,861 --> 00:49:54,613
They took the yard.

594
00:49:55,261 --> 00:49:57,934
The son of bitches took the yard.

595
00:49:59,661 --> 00:50:00,571
You okay, Ed?

596
00:50:00,861 --> 00:50:03,694
l'm hurting, Mikey.
That's a fact.

597
00:50:05,021 --> 00:50:07,774
You the ones wearing prison
blues now, you understand?

598
00:50:07,981 --> 00:50:10,779
Now we the man.
You keep your mouth talking

599
00:50:10,981 --> 00:50:13,131
and you'll leave here like him.

600
00:50:13,701 --> 00:50:15,373
-Let's go.
-Get them out, let's go.

601
00:50:15,621 --> 00:50:17,293
-On the move.
-Let's go.

602
00:50:17,501 --> 00:50:19,696
-Look at his head.
-Cover his face.

603
00:50:19,901 --> 00:50:22,051
-ls he dead?
-You shut your mouth!

604
00:50:22,661 --> 00:50:24,492
Or l'll hang you upside down.

605
00:50:24,741 --> 00:50:27,619
And l'll cut your throat
and empty you out like a hog.

606
00:50:33,141 --> 00:50:36,258
-Ed? What happened to your pants?
-Shut up, Mikey!

607
00:50:40,661 --> 00:50:43,539
We don't get a vote?
We don't get a say-so?

608
00:50:44,501 --> 00:50:46,139
You want him to die in here?

609
00:50:46,341 --> 00:50:49,014
Let me see a hand of every man
that wants him to die in here.

610
00:51:25,381 --> 00:51:26,291
Hold it, lady.

611
00:51:26,661 --> 00:51:28,299
lt's okay, it's okay.

612
00:51:28,501 --> 00:51:30,651
l went to the hospitals,
he's not there.

613
00:51:30,861 --> 00:51:33,136
-He's still in there.
-Yeah, not for long.

614
00:51:33,341 --> 00:51:35,809
-Are you going in?
-Yeah, we're waiting on the word.

615
00:51:36,021 --> 00:51:37,215
Report just in.

616
00:51:37,461 --> 00:51:41,534
Armed black power revolutionaries
are headed this way in a bus.

617
00:51:41,901 --> 00:51:43,812
-ln a bus?
-l want you to go find them.

618
00:51:44,021 --> 00:51:46,819
They join those rioters in there,
we got a revolution on our hands.

619
00:51:47,021 --> 00:51:48,932
Sarge, my best buddy's in there.

620
00:51:49,141 --> 00:51:50,699
Get moving. That's an order.

621
00:51:51,061 --> 00:51:54,371
There's a poor son of a bitch they
tossed head-first through a window.

622
00:51:54,581 --> 00:51:57,049
Wait a minute, lady.
Please, get back.

623
00:51:59,341 --> 00:52:01,696
-lt's my husband!
-l'm so sorry.

624
00:52:02,941 --> 00:52:05,455
We gotta clear this,
we gotta get him in the ambulance.

625
00:52:08,061 --> 00:52:09,414
Somebody help me!

626
00:52:32,901 --> 00:52:36,211
Governor Rockefeller
is in minute by minute contact

627
00:52:36,421 --> 00:52:38,412
with the authorities on the ground.

628
00:52:38,901 --> 00:52:40,050
Quiet down!

629
00:52:40,261 --> 00:52:42,058
He wants this situation resolved

630
00:52:42,261 --> 00:52:45,059
so that we can continue
with the work that is begun

631
00:52:45,261 --> 00:52:47,217
in reforming the prison system.

632
00:52:48,181 --> 00:52:50,456
The greatest tragedy would be

633
00:52:50,661 --> 00:52:52,174
that this incident

634
00:52:52,381 --> 00:52:55,612
pushed back the clock
of our joint effort to do that.

635
00:52:55,861 --> 00:52:58,739
Please get back!
That's all for now!

636
00:52:58,981 --> 00:53:01,575
We have a very serious
situation here

637
00:53:01,781 --> 00:53:05,217
which requires our immediate
attention. Just let us pass.

638
00:53:05,421 --> 00:53:07,252
We're ready to go in.

639
00:53:07,461 --> 00:53:09,053
The perimeter is secure.

640
00:53:09,301 --> 00:53:11,735
We know where most
of the hostages are.

641
00:53:13,021 --> 00:53:16,491
l'm relieving you of operational
command. Stand your men down.

642
00:53:16,741 --> 00:53:17,571
Stand them down?

643
00:53:17,821 --> 00:53:20,176
The procedure is to go in,
hard and fast,

644
00:53:20,421 --> 00:53:22,730
take out their ring leaders
and evacuate our personnel.

645
00:53:22,941 --> 00:53:26,013
-We're not doing this your way.
-My way is the book way.

646
00:53:26,221 --> 00:53:30,533
The book says we do it this way or
we put every officer in danger.

647
00:53:30,741 --> 00:53:32,777
The governor has agreed
to let me try another way.

648
00:53:33,021 --> 00:53:34,773
Now his instinct is to go in now,

649
00:53:35,021 --> 00:53:37,819
but l convinced him that
we can do this without bloodshed.

650
00:53:38,061 --> 00:53:40,131
Without further harm to your men.

651
00:53:40,341 --> 00:53:42,332
Your way doesn't work, does it?

652
00:53:42,541 --> 00:53:45,533
lf it did, we wouldn't be here,
wouldn we?

653
00:54:05,621 --> 00:54:08,693
Attica! Attica! All or nothing!

654
00:54:37,981 --> 00:54:41,496
Any man here
who has something to say

655
00:54:41,901 --> 00:54:43,778
is gonna get the chance to say it!

656
00:54:46,621 --> 00:54:50,296
We have people here
who are gonna listen to you!

657
00:54:50,541 --> 00:54:53,180
And they are gonna take
your demands

658
00:54:53,381 --> 00:54:56,293
all the way up the ladder!

659
00:54:58,861 --> 00:55:00,055
Sit down.

660
00:55:00,261 --> 00:55:01,614
Sit down, sit down!

661
00:55:05,021 --> 00:55:06,340
Now you the niggers now!

662
00:55:07,901 --> 00:55:10,813
You white boys gonna find out
what it feel like

663
00:55:11,261 --> 00:55:13,775
to have the complection
for the connection.

664
00:55:14,381 --> 00:55:16,292
Only this time the shit be flying

665
00:55:16,541 --> 00:55:17,815
in the right direction.

666
00:55:19,661 --> 00:55:21,731
l'd smoke your ass right now,

667
00:55:22,701 --> 00:55:24,054
but while we negotiating...

668
00:55:24,501 --> 00:55:25,377
Sit down!

669
00:55:28,341 --> 00:55:30,377
-We need your asses.
-Bullshit.

670
00:55:31,141 --> 00:55:34,292
The department doesn't negotiate.
That's policy!

671
00:55:36,621 --> 00:55:37,417
This man

672
00:55:37,621 --> 00:55:40,055
is Mr. William Kunstler.

673
00:55:40,261 --> 00:55:42,013
He is our man!

674
00:55:43,901 --> 00:55:45,937
Well, it looks like to me

675
00:55:46,781 --> 00:55:48,373
they're negotiating.

676
00:55:48,621 --> 00:55:50,532
Here is the list
of our demands:

677
00:55:50,861 --> 00:55:53,580
Food, water,

678
00:55:53,821 --> 00:55:55,493
and shelter for all inmates!

679
00:55:55,741 --> 00:55:58,255
Chowtime! There you go, chowtime!

680
00:56:00,341 --> 00:56:01,535
Chowtime!

681
00:56:01,781 --> 00:56:02,850
Anybody need a shower?

682
00:56:03,061 --> 00:56:05,256
Raise your hand
if you need a shower.

683
00:56:05,661 --> 00:56:06,537
Too bad.

684
00:56:06,741 --> 00:56:09,016
This is Attica.
You got to wait a week.

685
00:56:12,301 --> 00:56:14,496
You ain't got no pants.

686
00:56:15,301 --> 00:56:18,054
You gonna get your little pink willy
frost bit. You want some pants?

687
00:56:18,261 --> 00:56:19,091
Screw you.

688
00:56:21,221 --> 00:56:23,610
Well, look what we have here.

689
00:56:24,221 --> 00:56:26,018
We got some pants!

690
00:56:26,301 --> 00:56:28,212
Why they just your size. Big...

691
00:56:28,421 --> 00:56:29,376
and dumb.

692
00:56:30,221 --> 00:56:31,290
What do you say?

693
00:56:33,981 --> 00:56:36,939
Yeah, sure. Give me the pants.

694
00:56:38,861 --> 00:56:40,692
Yeah, well, this being Attica,
it ain't so simple, see.

695
00:56:41,301 --> 00:56:42,700
See when you put in a request,

696
00:56:42,901 --> 00:56:44,493
you got to do it by Attica rules.

697
00:56:44,741 --> 00:56:47,813
-You got to say something like...
-Just give me the pants.

698
00:56:49,621 --> 00:56:52,340
You'll say:
''Negatively impacted as l am,

699
00:56:52,581 --> 00:56:54,811
through a shortfall of covering
to my little pink willy...''

700
00:56:55,181 --> 00:56:56,250
l ain't saying that.

701
00:56:58,021 --> 00:56:59,420
''l humbly

702
00:56:59,661 --> 00:57:02,414
and respectfully
request a pair of pants

703
00:57:02,661 --> 00:57:04,652
Mr. Cecil, sir!''

704
00:57:10,381 --> 00:57:12,451
-l humbly...
-l can't hear you!

705
00:57:13,901 --> 00:57:16,051
-l humbly...
-l said l can't hear you!

706
00:57:16,381 --> 00:57:17,450
l humbly...

707
00:57:17,701 --> 00:57:18,611
and respectfully...

708
00:57:18,861 --> 00:57:20,579
request a pair of pants...

709
00:57:21,341 --> 00:57:22,740
Mr. Cecil, sir.

710
00:57:25,901 --> 00:57:28,131
And what about
your little pink willy?

711
00:57:32,781 --> 00:57:34,339
l do not want my pink willy

712
00:57:34,581 --> 00:57:36,253
frost bit.

713
00:57:36,541 --> 00:57:37,860
l don't blame you.

714
00:57:38,101 --> 00:57:40,217
lt ain't much,
but it's yours, right?

715
00:57:42,821 --> 00:57:43,651
Put the pants on.

716
00:57:46,101 --> 00:57:48,661
Man we just having
some fun, Chaka.

717
00:57:49,421 --> 00:57:50,979
They came here
to have some fun, too.

718
00:57:53,381 --> 00:57:55,611
You are not alone!

719
00:57:56,901 --> 00:57:59,290
The world is watching.

720
00:58:03,061 --> 00:58:06,053
We have assurances from
governor Rockefeller

721
00:58:06,421 --> 00:58:08,013
that there will be no force used

722
00:58:08,261 --> 00:58:10,900
to retake the prison

723
00:58:11,141 --> 00:58:13,177
while the negotiations continue.

724
00:58:15,101 --> 00:58:16,932
Power to the people!

725
00:58:20,221 --> 00:58:23,372
P'alante.
Whatever that shit means.

726
00:58:24,341 --> 00:58:26,571
This is an show of protest,

727
00:58:26,781 --> 00:58:29,500
a cry against injustice!

728
00:58:33,741 --> 00:58:36,938
All right, l want you to report
exactly what you see in here.

729
00:58:44,621 --> 00:58:45,940
ls this what the well-dressed

730
00:58:46,181 --> 00:58:47,534
hostage is wearing this year?

731
00:58:50,541 --> 00:58:52,133
You want some shoes, man?

732
00:58:52,821 --> 00:58:54,334
l don't want them, no.

733
00:58:55,701 --> 00:58:57,293
You some kind of hippie, pig?

734
00:58:58,421 --> 00:59:00,412
lt's all right
to ask for shoes, man.

735
00:59:01,221 --> 00:59:02,700
You're the new guy, right?

736
00:59:03,621 --> 00:59:05,691
lt's okay to ask for shoes.
Tell him, it's okay.

737
00:59:05,941 --> 00:59:08,330
-Ask for the shoes, Mike.
-Do it, Michael.

738
00:59:08,741 --> 00:59:10,538
l'm not asking for shoes.

739
00:59:13,221 --> 00:59:14,495
Stop the camera.

740
00:59:15,421 --> 00:59:16,456
Turn it off.

741
00:59:20,541 --> 00:59:21,451
Look,

742
00:59:22,141 --> 00:59:24,257
you gonna be here
till we get what we want.

743
00:59:25,621 --> 00:59:28,852
-You got an attitude problem?
-l don't have an attitude.

744
00:59:29,141 --> 00:59:32,019
Correction:
you do have an attitude.

745
00:59:32,381 --> 00:59:34,576
What you don't have
is something on your feet.

746
00:59:35,621 --> 00:59:38,579
You have one last chance
to ask for shoes.

747
00:59:39,941 --> 00:59:41,374
l'm not asking.

748
00:59:44,381 --> 00:59:45,939
Then you ain't getting them.

749
00:59:49,741 --> 00:59:52,050
Come with me, l got something
to show you over here.

750
00:59:58,541 --> 01:00:00,532
You should have taken the shoes,
Mike.

751
01:00:02,381 --> 01:00:04,019
Why didn't you?

752
01:00:06,381 --> 01:00:08,019
They're just fooling with us.

753
01:00:08,261 --> 01:00:11,571
You got to put yourself
in their situation.

754
01:00:12,181 --> 01:00:13,819
No. lt's not right.

755
01:00:55,261 --> 01:00:58,617
-Any news?
-Couldn't find the revolutionaries.

756
01:00:58,821 --> 01:01:01,016
Okay, l got something else for you.
Something important.

757
01:01:01,741 --> 01:01:04,938
-How long are we gonna be talking?
-Just stay here as long as it takes.

758
01:01:05,461 --> 01:01:07,929
They have no heating
in their cells.

759
01:01:08,341 --> 01:01:11,856
The parole rate is half that of
any other institution in the state.

760
01:01:12,661 --> 01:01:16,097
Why aren't given more than one roll
of toilet paper every 8 weeks?

761
01:01:16,341 --> 01:01:18,252
Why only one shower a week?

762
01:01:18,781 --> 01:01:20,737
No wonder you had an uprising here.

763
01:01:20,941 --> 01:01:22,613
This is a prison riot.

764
01:01:22,821 --> 01:01:26,575
Not an uprising, or a revolution,
or a negotiation.

765
01:01:27,781 --> 01:01:30,773
The riot is all those armed men
outside the walls

766
01:01:30,981 --> 01:01:32,130
waiting for revenge.

767
01:01:32,341 --> 01:01:34,536
Nobody's going to take revenge.

768
01:01:34,781 --> 01:01:37,090
There are gonna be no reprisals.

769
01:01:40,501 --> 01:01:42,856
Why aren't Spanish-speaking inmates

770
01:01:43,061 --> 01:01:45,370
allowed to send or receive mail?

771
01:01:46,341 --> 01:01:48,059
They're allowed as much mail
as anybody else,

772
01:01:48,261 --> 01:01:52,095
my problem is l don't have any
Spanish-speaking officer to censor.

773
01:01:52,581 --> 01:01:55,300
So they can write letters,
they just can't mail them.

774
01:01:55,501 --> 01:01:58,732
And their relatives can send them
as much mail as they like,

775
01:01:58,941 --> 01:02:00,533
it's just that
you don't deliver them?

776
01:02:02,061 --> 01:02:04,575
Has anything changed in the prison
system? ls anything going to change?

777
01:02:04,861 --> 01:02:06,180
Write this down:

778
01:02:07,141 --> 01:02:09,257
five bearclaws,

779
01:02:09,821 --> 01:02:11,652
three cinnamon twists,

780
01:02:12,181 --> 01:02:14,172
six hot dogs with everything...

781
01:02:14,421 --> 01:02:17,618
l'm asking you to think again,
commissioner. You did it your way,

782
01:02:17,861 --> 01:02:19,533
now do it the book way.

783
01:02:20,061 --> 01:02:23,815
One way or another, we're gonna
have to go in there. Over the wall.

784
01:02:24,621 --> 01:02:28,409
The longer we delay it, the more
dangerous. They got barricades,

785
01:02:28,621 --> 01:02:31,738
gas bombs, they got a guy building
a rocket launcher or something.

786
01:02:31,981 --> 01:02:35,098
l'm going to negotiate this
all the way.

787
01:02:35,341 --> 01:02:39,414
lt's my officers' lives
you're negotiating, goddamnit!

788
01:02:40,301 --> 01:02:42,451
Shithouse call! Shithouse call!

789
01:02:46,341 --> 01:02:48,172
Get up! Come on.

790
01:02:49,541 --> 01:02:50,610
Let's go!

791
01:02:54,301 --> 01:02:56,019
Let's go, line 'em up.

792
01:02:59,621 --> 01:03:01,577
Pick it up. Pick it up.

793
01:03:01,781 --> 01:03:04,853
No, no. You don't want it.
Get off him. Get up there.

794
01:03:05,061 --> 01:03:06,938
You don't want it.

795
01:03:11,541 --> 01:03:13,577
Look. They got the lieutenant.

796
01:03:13,861 --> 01:03:16,694
Look what we found, thanks
to the geniuses on your side.

797
01:03:16,941 --> 01:03:18,533
Pigs gave us a list
of all the piglets

798
01:03:18,821 --> 01:03:21,210
unaccounted for.
His name's on the list.

799
01:03:21,421 --> 01:03:22,410
We went looking.

800
01:03:22,621 --> 01:03:25,181
Found his dumbass hiding
under a bench in the metal shop.

801
01:03:25,381 --> 01:03:26,814
Any of you men been injured?

802
01:03:27,021 --> 01:03:29,660
They've all been treated fairly,
just as you'll be.

803
01:03:29,861 --> 01:03:32,978
Nobody's been chained and nobody's
been made to spread them.

804
01:03:35,261 --> 01:03:36,694
Come on, you're next.

805
01:03:38,221 --> 01:03:39,734
Come on, man. Take a dump.

806
01:03:40,461 --> 01:03:42,929
-Take a leak.
-No. l ain't going. Not here.

807
01:03:43,141 --> 01:03:45,450
-You're gonna tear your insides up.
-What's the problem?

808
01:03:46,341 --> 01:03:48,138
Guy don't like the facilities.

809
01:03:48,581 --> 01:03:51,573
Look, you guys better
straighten him out or we will.

810
01:03:52,781 --> 01:03:54,692
Okay, what's gotten into you now?

811
01:03:54,941 --> 01:03:57,136
You trying to act like a hero,
you make us look bad.

812
01:03:57,341 --> 01:03:58,899
l'm not trying to be a hero, Ed.

813
01:03:59,901 --> 01:04:02,176
Will you tell him to use the can
sometime, he's making them mad.

814
01:04:02,541 --> 01:04:04,293
You heard your uncle,
get on the pot.

815
01:04:04,861 --> 01:04:05,976
That's an order.

816
01:04:10,221 --> 01:04:12,052
All right, you had your chance.
Let's go.

817
01:04:12,301 --> 01:04:14,337
Go! Move it out!
Everybody, let's go!

818
01:04:27,421 --> 01:04:29,730
Why aren't you wearing shoes?

819
01:04:29,941 --> 01:04:33,217
-ls it because they took the pants?
-lt's just me.

820
01:04:33,461 --> 01:04:35,053
Where are his shoes?

821
01:04:42,741 --> 01:04:45,016
l gave my life to this department.

822
01:04:45,221 --> 01:04:47,530
l trusted the sons a bitches.

823
01:04:47,741 --> 01:04:49,333
They always told me
if anything happens

824
01:04:49,581 --> 01:04:51,811
we go in, we don't talk...

825
01:04:52,021 --> 01:04:53,898
and we don't make deals!

826
01:04:54,101 --> 01:04:55,932
They betrayed us, damnit!

827
01:04:56,141 --> 01:04:58,939
The lousy rotten
son of a bitches bastards!

828
01:04:59,221 --> 01:05:00,495
Shitcan that kind of talk!

829
01:05:00,741 --> 01:05:02,857
They're giving the orders now,

830
01:05:03,061 --> 01:05:05,256
but we have a code of honor here.

831
01:05:05,541 --> 01:05:06,656
Get some shoes on your feet.

832
01:05:07,061 --> 01:05:09,495
l don't have shoes
because l won't beg for them.

833
01:05:09,741 --> 01:05:11,538
Take some pride in yourself, son.

834
01:05:11,741 --> 01:05:13,891
For morale purposes how you look...

835
01:05:14,181 --> 01:05:15,500
How l look?

836
01:05:15,741 --> 01:05:18,574
What are we, a bunch of civilians?
l gave you an order! Get shoes...

837
01:05:18,781 --> 01:05:21,215
-l don't want shoes!
-l gave you an order!

838
01:05:23,541 --> 01:05:27,170
Why don't you just thing about what
your dad would do if he were here.

839
01:05:27,861 --> 01:05:30,421
He'd be thinking for himself,
that's what he'd be doing.

840
01:05:41,461 --> 01:05:44,658
lf l have to suck the cock
of every man on this yard

841
01:05:44,901 --> 01:05:46,971
to get out of here, l'll do it.

842
01:05:47,701 --> 01:05:50,534
And l won't give a thought
about it when l get out.

843
01:05:50,861 --> 01:05:53,978
Nobody's gonna
have to suck anybody's cock.

844
01:05:54,461 --> 01:05:58,374
What happened to self-respect?
Pride in yourself, in your unit?

845
01:05:58,621 --> 01:06:01,374
Nothing we do here says anything
one way or the other about us.

846
01:06:02,701 --> 01:06:05,169
What the hell is he talking about?

847
01:06:06,981 --> 01:06:08,778
lt's not about proving things.

848
01:06:09,021 --> 01:06:11,091
-Then what is it about?
-Goddamn!

849
01:06:15,461 --> 01:06:17,531
Fucker! Fucker!

850
01:06:17,741 --> 01:06:20,130
Let him go! Let him go.

851
01:06:29,141 --> 01:06:32,656
That's the 3rd time he's tried that.
This dude is out of control.

852
01:06:32,861 --> 01:06:35,773
-l'll deal with it.
-You can't have him in the yard.

853
01:06:35,981 --> 01:06:37,096
Shut up.

854
01:06:38,101 --> 01:06:40,251
You can't have him
in general population.

855
01:06:40,461 --> 01:06:43,692
l said l'd take care of it.
Let him go.

856
01:06:58,981 --> 01:07:01,620
You think he's got an angle?
What's going on?

857
01:07:01,861 --> 01:07:03,089
An angle?

858
01:07:03,341 --> 01:07:06,413
Make them so pissed off with him
they'll let him go.

859
01:07:08,141 --> 01:07:10,416
l knew a guy in Nam once,

860
01:07:10,661 --> 01:07:13,050
tied his pecker to a doorknob.

861
01:07:13,261 --> 01:07:16,412
Sprained it so bad
he was on the next plane home.

862
01:07:18,021 --> 01:07:21,252
l don't want to die here because
somebody wants to be a hero.

863
01:07:21,861 --> 01:07:25,012
l'm gonna be one son of a bitch
hard to please corpse, to tell you.

864
01:07:25,221 --> 01:07:28,691
Either he pulls with us
or we cut him loose.

865
01:07:34,061 --> 01:07:36,621
Maybe that rookie took
a bigger bang upside his head.

866
01:07:36,861 --> 01:07:38,453
Yeah, something wrong with him,
that's for sure.

867
01:07:38,781 --> 01:07:41,978
l say we take care of him.
Quietly.

868
01:07:42,221 --> 01:07:45,019
-Take him back to one of the cells.
-He ain't that big a problem.

869
01:07:45,261 --> 01:07:49,220
Say he got in a brother's face and
got cut. Then the shit goes down.

870
01:07:49,421 --> 01:07:51,810
They're just waiting
for something like that.

871
01:07:52,181 --> 01:07:54,376
-Then nobody gets out of here.
-Shit, C...

872
01:07:54,981 --> 01:07:57,256
You ain't figured
this shit out yet?

873
01:07:57,501 --> 01:07:59,731
Nobody gets out of here.

874
01:08:00,181 --> 01:08:01,660
lt can't be.

875
01:08:01,981 --> 01:08:03,653
lt never could be.

876
01:08:07,181 --> 01:08:08,614
Let me talk to him.

877
01:08:16,821 --> 01:08:18,379
What's your name?

878
01:08:19,141 --> 01:08:21,257
-Go to hell.
-What's your name?

879
01:08:21,861 --> 01:08:24,250
-Michael Smith.
-Look, Smith.

880
01:08:24,781 --> 01:08:28,330
Used to be a cissy on D block.
Liked in in the mouth and ass.

881
01:08:28,541 --> 01:08:30,293
ls that your problem?

882
01:08:30,821 --> 01:08:34,370
You want us on your case, your
buddies too? Piss everybody off?

883
01:08:34,581 --> 01:08:36,094
l'm not trying to piss anybody off.

884
01:08:36,381 --> 01:08:39,532
What you need to be trying to do
is go along, you understand?

885
01:08:40,021 --> 01:08:42,899
-You're Bishop, right?
-No, that ain't my name.

886
01:08:43,141 --> 01:08:45,291
Yeah, you're sure
a good example of going along.

887
01:08:45,541 --> 01:08:48,009
You trying to get killed, man?
ls that what you're looking to do?

888
01:08:48,261 --> 01:08:49,774
l want out of here.

889
01:08:50,661 --> 01:08:54,939
You can kill me, you can take my
life. But that's all you can do.

890
01:08:55,141 --> 01:08:56,938
l got nothing left to lose.

891
01:08:57,141 --> 01:09:00,178
So why don't you leave me alone
unless it's tell me l'm getting out

892
01:09:00,381 --> 01:09:02,576
because l got nothing more
to say to you.

893
01:09:12,221 --> 01:09:14,860
-How's it going, Sharon?
-l've had better days, for sure.

894
01:09:15,061 --> 01:09:18,178
-How's that baby?
-Handling it better than any of us.

895
01:09:20,061 --> 01:09:22,894
You heard anything? Anybody said
anything about when you're going in?

896
01:09:23,101 --> 01:09:23,897
They're still talking,

897
01:09:24,101 --> 01:09:25,500
as far as l know.

898
01:09:26,741 --> 01:09:28,857
Everything's gonna be okay.

899
01:09:29,061 --> 01:09:31,894
They've got a contingency plan
with these kind of things,

900
01:09:32,101 --> 01:09:34,934
-he's gonna be all right.
-That's nice to know.

901
01:09:35,261 --> 01:09:37,695
ls there a contingency plan for
losing a prison in 2 minutes flat?

902
01:09:38,261 --> 01:09:39,535
What's that supposed to mean?

903
01:09:39,741 --> 01:09:41,538
You know exactly what that means.

904
01:09:42,341 --> 01:09:43,933
Now you listen to me.

905
01:09:44,741 --> 01:09:47,813
Maybe we've got
a generational difference,

906
01:09:48,141 --> 01:09:52,293
but l don't see every man in prison
as a miscarriage of justice

907
01:09:52,501 --> 01:09:54,810
and the guys keeping him in there
as the bad guys.

908
01:09:55,021 --> 01:09:58,536
l don't know about good guys or bad,
just that my husband's in there.

909
01:09:59,901 --> 01:10:03,018
Well, your husband's my son.
And l got a brother in there.

910
01:10:04,461 --> 01:10:06,053
l know. l'm sorry.

911
01:10:06,901 --> 01:10:08,095
lt's all right.

912
01:10:08,301 --> 01:10:10,417
You heard about
what's going on in there?

913
01:10:10,741 --> 01:10:13,255
l heard a lot of bullshit talk,
l know that much.

914
01:10:13,581 --> 01:10:16,220
-This isn't bullshit, my friend.
-You know something?

915
01:10:16,421 --> 01:10:17,171
What do you know?

916
01:10:17,381 --> 01:10:19,019
Maybe l do and maybe l don't.

917
01:10:19,621 --> 01:10:22,374
What l say is they got
no business negotiating.

918
01:10:22,621 --> 01:10:25,499
We ought be going back in there with
a bullet for everybody in the yard.

919
01:10:25,701 --> 01:10:26,975
ls that right?

920
01:10:27,181 --> 01:10:30,856
We do it now, we do it later.
Later ain't no use, right Hal?

921
01:10:31,301 --> 01:10:32,575
Wait a minute, Frank.

922
01:10:32,781 --> 01:10:36,820
We got a lot of angry guys in there:
Muslims, Panthers, young lords...

923
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:38,898
besides your everyday anti-social.

924
01:10:39,181 --> 01:10:41,615
So we ought to go in, right?
Clean their clocks!

925
01:10:41,821 --> 01:10:43,095
You know what, Yates?

926
01:10:43,301 --> 01:10:46,691
lf those guys don't get out safe
it's because of loudmouths like you.

927
01:10:46,901 --> 01:10:50,940
-You got a bad conscience for not...
-And you for not running a prison!

928
01:10:51,141 --> 01:10:52,938
Sit down.

929
01:10:53,501 --> 01:10:56,174
Sit down, Frank,
or you're both out of here.

930
01:10:56,661 --> 01:10:59,698
This is my bar.
We got a war going on here already.

931
01:10:59,981 --> 01:11:01,255
He's out of line.

932
01:11:01,541 --> 01:11:02,530
You tell him.
Come on, help me here.

933
01:11:02,941 --> 01:11:06,058
You're both out of line.
Just settle down, all right?

934
01:11:07,381 --> 01:11:09,497
l'll guarantee you one thing.

935
01:11:09,741 --> 01:11:12,255
l'm gonna be there
the minute we take the prison back.

936
01:11:12,461 --> 01:11:13,689
They've had they're say.

937
01:11:13,941 --> 01:11:14,896
Now l'm gonna have mine.

938
01:11:15,941 --> 01:11:18,409
Whatever they've done to our boys,
they've got a payback coming!

939
01:11:18,621 --> 01:11:21,579
Would you shut up? Maybe they
haven't done anything yet.

940
01:11:21,781 --> 01:11:24,534
-They don't have any proof.
-For Christ's sake!

941
01:11:24,821 --> 01:11:27,096
They got photos of some
of the hostages strung up

942
01:11:27,341 --> 01:11:29,536
with their fucking cocks cut off

943
01:11:29,741 --> 01:11:31,971
and stuck in their fucking mouths!
They've been killing one

944
01:11:32,181 --> 01:11:32,977
every couple of hours!

945
01:11:34,061 --> 01:11:35,016
You asshole!

946
01:11:35,221 --> 01:11:37,940
You wanna step outside
and call me a fucking asshole?

947
01:11:40,501 --> 01:11:42,378
Oswald's going in the yard!

948
01:11:42,661 --> 01:11:44,014
Jess, let's go!

949
01:12:54,981 --> 01:12:55,857
We've agreed on

950
01:12:56,061 --> 01:12:58,336
28 of your demands.

951
01:12:58,781 --> 01:13:01,659
Everything from a ban
on censorship of mail

952
01:13:01,901 --> 01:13:04,369
to Spanish language
television programs.

953
01:13:04,941 --> 01:13:08,411
But we can't go forward
on anything else

954
01:13:08,621 --> 01:13:11,977
until we get something back. We get
some of those men out of here.

955
01:13:12,781 --> 01:13:14,578
What about a guarantee
against reprisals?

956
01:13:14,781 --> 01:13:16,294
You got a court order

957
01:13:16,501 --> 01:13:19,937
barring the prison administration
from taking any such action.

958
01:13:20,141 --> 01:13:23,213
Bullshit, a court order. lt ain't
nothing but a piece of paper.

959
01:13:23,421 --> 01:13:27,300
How's that gonna stop those gorillas
from putting a gas up my ass?

960
01:13:27,501 --> 01:13:28,820
What the fuck about amnesty?

961
01:13:32,661 --> 01:13:35,812
Offenses connected with the takeover
will have to be investigated.

962
01:13:36,021 --> 01:13:38,012
-There's no amnesty?
-l can't guarantee it.

963
01:13:38,221 --> 01:13:40,781
-What about the governor, can't he?
-He has the power, yes.

964
01:13:41,021 --> 01:13:44,218
-But is he gonna use it?
-Man they been jiving us all along.

965
01:13:44,421 --> 01:13:47,572
They just waiting for us to crack,
then they walk in and break heads.

966
01:13:47,821 --> 01:13:48,936
We gotta string a few of those up,

967
01:13:49,141 --> 01:13:52,850
we gotta show them we mean business.
We want a plane to take us to Africa

968
01:13:53,141 --> 01:13:54,813
and we want it now!

969
01:13:55,021 --> 01:13:56,932
Hell, man.
l'm from Washington Heights!

970
01:13:57,141 --> 01:14:00,019
l'll fight any man
try to put me on a plane to Africa!

971
01:14:00,621 --> 01:14:03,419
You know who scares me the most,
Mr. Oswald?

972
01:14:03,621 --> 01:14:06,818
Not these guys, l can live with
them, l got no problem here.

973
01:14:07,061 --> 01:14:09,655
lt's those gorillas up there!

974
01:14:13,541 --> 01:14:15,293
l've bent and l've bent

975
01:14:15,501 --> 01:14:18,538
and l've bent.
l can't bend any more.

976
01:14:18,941 --> 01:14:20,613
lt's in your hands now.

977
01:14:21,141 --> 01:14:22,620
Give me one hostage.

978
01:14:23,101 --> 01:14:24,090
Just one.

979
01:14:24,301 --> 01:14:27,099
Hey, listen up!
And let a real man speak.

980
01:14:30,021 --> 01:14:33,616
l'm 55 years old.
l got one son in here,

981
01:14:34,221 --> 01:14:36,416
two more in federal prisons.

982
01:14:36,621 --> 01:14:39,852
l've had 9 grandchildren,
3 shot by police.

983
01:14:40,301 --> 01:14:41,939
Go on, keep talking.

984
01:14:42,221 --> 01:14:43,620
The Freedom Bell rang

985
01:14:43,821 --> 01:14:45,652
four days ago.

986
01:14:46,141 --> 01:14:47,972
But l bent my back
over this broom for so long

987
01:14:48,901 --> 01:14:51,461
till l didn't know no better
than to keep a hold of it.

988
01:14:51,901 --> 01:14:53,220
Preach on that broom!

989
01:14:55,621 --> 01:14:57,418
lf they won't let you
live like men,

990
01:14:57,621 --> 01:14:59,896
you can sure as hell die like men.

991
01:15:04,181 --> 01:15:07,173
What you gonna do about the lies,
Mr. Commissioner?

992
01:15:07,421 --> 01:15:11,209
We didn't push no Willis
out a 6th floor window, did we?

993
01:15:13,381 --> 01:15:15,019
We didn't burn no hostages

994
01:15:15,221 --> 01:15:16,939
with a blowtorch, did we?

995
01:15:18,221 --> 01:15:20,052
Why do you let them say that?

996
01:15:20,261 --> 01:15:22,217
Can't you pick up a phone
and tell them the truth?

997
01:15:23,341 --> 01:15:26,014
Amnesty! Amnesty! Amnesty!

998
01:15:30,941 --> 01:15:32,738
They need the lies!

999
01:15:33,741 --> 01:15:35,493
They want the people

1000
01:15:36,141 --> 01:15:38,974
to think we animals!

1001
01:15:39,941 --> 01:15:43,058
That way they can come in here

1002
01:15:43,261 --> 01:15:46,810
and do anything
they want to do to us!

1003
01:15:47,581 --> 01:15:49,253
Well l say

1004
01:15:49,541 --> 01:15:52,613
they still shucking and jiving!

1005
01:15:55,501 --> 01:15:58,220
l say we gotta hit 'em

1006
01:15:58,421 --> 01:16:00,013
with a two by four

1007
01:16:00,501 --> 01:16:02,969
and we can get serious!

1008
01:16:03,861 --> 01:16:05,294
Now if they prepared

1009
01:16:05,501 --> 01:16:08,811
to bargain for the little piggies,

1010
01:16:09,861 --> 01:16:12,659
maybe they prepared to bargain

1011
01:16:12,861 --> 01:16:15,694
for the big pig hisself!

1012
01:16:17,781 --> 01:16:18,770
l say...

1013
01:16:19,021 --> 01:16:21,330
we grab the big pig!

1014
01:16:23,341 --> 01:16:26,139
Brothers!
We gave our word!

1015
01:16:26,341 --> 01:16:28,411
We granted him safe passage!

1016
01:16:29,061 --> 01:16:32,337
You gave him no word from me!

1017
01:16:33,581 --> 01:16:36,937
Now did he give his word for you?

1018
01:16:38,221 --> 01:16:39,290
For you!

1019
01:16:41,581 --> 01:16:42,570
Attica!

1020
01:16:42,821 --> 01:16:45,051
All or nothing! Attica!

1021
01:16:45,261 --> 01:16:46,296
All or nothing!

1022
01:16:53,821 --> 01:16:55,652
Come on.
We got to get you out of here.

1023
01:16:56,061 --> 01:16:57,255
Get him out of here.
Let's go.

1024
01:17:08,101 --> 01:17:10,740
See what happens when you start
calling them mister?

1025
01:17:14,981 --> 01:17:16,573
You got to get the smoker in here.

1026
01:17:16,941 --> 01:17:19,580
You got to get governor Rockefeller
hisself up here

1027
01:17:19,781 --> 01:17:21,294
or we all dead men.

1028
01:17:36,021 --> 01:17:38,581
l just came back
from Rochester General.

1029
01:17:39,421 --> 01:17:41,696
Officer Willis died
of head injuries

1030
01:17:41,941 --> 01:17:43,215
an hour ago.

1031
01:17:52,221 --> 01:17:54,496
One of my men just died, governor.

1032
01:17:54,701 --> 01:17:56,453
l'm under a lot of pressure
to go in now.

1033
01:17:56,661 --> 01:18:00,017
But l really think another couple
of days could make the difference.

1034
01:18:00,221 --> 01:18:02,018
lt's starting to rain now and...

1035
01:18:04,741 --> 01:18:08,097
Yes, l understand, sir. l understand
your under a lot of pressure too.

1036
01:18:08,301 --> 01:18:10,895
l realize you can't offer amnesty,
but l'm not asking for that.

1037
01:18:11,101 --> 01:18:12,329
No, sir, no l...

1038
01:18:13,341 --> 01:18:15,775
Sir, l think you have
to come up here in person.

1039
01:18:16,821 --> 01:18:21,133
No, not to negociate. l'm not sure
there's anything left to negotiate.

1040
01:18:22,221 --> 01:18:24,132
But if the governor came
in person

1041
01:18:24,341 --> 01:18:26,616
and showed his concern,
l'm sure...

1042
01:18:28,261 --> 01:18:30,650
l understand the perception
problems, sir,

1043
01:18:30,861 --> 01:18:32,852
but l'm concerned for the hostages.

1044
01:18:33,821 --> 01:18:36,540
Yes, and l've nothing else to offer
the men that are holding them

1045
01:18:36,741 --> 01:18:38,811
except your personal involvement.

1046
01:18:40,021 --> 01:18:44,333
Yes, l have everything l need to
retake the facility if l decide...

1047
01:18:51,981 --> 01:18:53,573
Yes, l understand.

1048
01:18:56,261 --> 01:18:57,410
Very good.

1049
01:19:10,381 --> 01:19:15,171
The governor is about to announce a
commission of inquiry into the riot.

1050
01:19:16,861 --> 01:19:20,740
He has every confidence
we will both be vindicated.

1051
01:19:32,621 --> 01:19:34,100
l'm going to see Willis' wife.

1052
01:19:36,341 --> 01:19:37,171
l'm sorry.

1053
01:19:37,621 --> 01:19:39,134
You didn't know him.

1054
01:19:39,541 --> 01:19:42,009
He coached my kid's
little league team.

1055
01:19:42,221 --> 01:19:43,893
His daughter babysat for us.

1056
01:19:44,661 --> 01:19:46,379
l just need another day.

1057
01:19:46,581 --> 01:19:47,934
You don't have it.

1058
01:19:48,981 --> 01:19:51,017
What do you think is gonna happen

1059
01:19:51,221 --> 01:19:53,610
when word gets out every man in
the yard is now facing murder one?

1060
01:19:55,941 --> 01:19:57,897
You ran out of road, commissioner.

1061
01:19:58,781 --> 01:20:00,419
l was right to wait.

1062
01:20:00,981 --> 01:20:02,414
l was right to negotiate.

1063
01:20:04,181 --> 01:20:06,695
Tell that to Willis's wife
and kids.

1064
01:20:31,341 --> 01:20:35,016
You sure about this?
Everybody goes down on murder one?

1065
01:20:35,581 --> 01:20:38,379
Under New York State law,
every man in this yard

1066
01:20:38,581 --> 01:20:41,300
is culpable for every felony
committed in it.

1067
01:20:41,501 --> 01:20:43,059
lncluding homicide.

1068
01:20:45,021 --> 01:20:47,455
They gonna put 2,000 guys on trial?

1069
01:20:48,421 --> 01:20:50,810
You wanna take a chance
they won't?

1070
01:20:55,141 --> 01:20:57,052
lt's going down,
isn't it, lieutenant?

1071
01:20:57,861 --> 01:20:59,772
They got nothing to lose now.

1072
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,699
When l was in Vietnam,

1073
01:21:01,941 --> 01:21:04,819
l used to get a pain
in my left gut

1074
01:21:05,021 --> 01:21:07,535
just before we took incoming fire.

1075
01:21:08,021 --> 01:21:09,659
l got it again.

1076
01:21:12,221 --> 01:21:12,971
Smith,

1077
01:21:15,421 --> 01:21:18,857
l'm still gonna have to write
you up when we get out of here.

1078
01:21:19,061 --> 01:21:20,460
You realize that.

1079
01:21:21,501 --> 01:21:24,254
Conduct prejudicial to
good order,

1080
01:21:24,461 --> 01:21:26,656
endangering your fellow officers...

1081
01:21:26,861 --> 01:21:28,897
You do what you got to do,
lieutenant.

1082
01:21:29,101 --> 01:21:33,413
Somebody make a note of this! That's
the attitude l'm talking about!

1083
01:21:33,701 --> 01:21:34,690
lnsubordination by an officer...

1084
01:21:35,741 --> 01:21:38,892
Get out of his face!
What are you trying to do?

1085
01:21:39,101 --> 01:21:40,853
l'm trying to hold us together!

1086
01:21:41,301 --> 01:21:42,814
We're a unit!

1087
01:21:44,821 --> 01:21:46,095
You know, you're right.

1088
01:21:46,741 --> 01:21:48,732
l don't have what it takes.

1089
01:21:48,941 --> 01:21:51,739
l wasn't a guard long enough
to know how to be a prisoner.

1090
01:21:52,701 --> 01:21:54,453
What does that mean?

1091
01:21:54,861 --> 01:21:58,536
lt means you're so good at giving
orders you knew how to take them.

1092
01:21:58,821 --> 01:22:00,254
Me, too, Michael?

1093
01:22:00,741 --> 01:22:02,811
lt couldn't be any other way, Ken.

1094
01:22:04,341 --> 01:22:06,093
Screw you, asshole.

1095
01:22:07,221 --> 01:22:09,530
l don't know who the hell you are,
Michael.

1096
01:22:09,741 --> 01:22:12,892
l watched you grow up and
l don't know who the hell you are

1097
01:22:13,181 --> 01:22:15,251
and l don't know
what you're doing.

1098
01:22:15,501 --> 01:22:18,698
He's pissing in the tent,
that's what he's doing!

1099
01:22:19,461 --> 01:22:22,259
Pissing in the tent!
Look at him!

1100
01:22:24,661 --> 01:22:26,014
ls the governor coming?

1101
01:22:29,061 --> 01:22:31,575
l need to know the governor's
on his way!

1102
01:22:35,821 --> 01:22:37,379
ls he coming?

1103
01:23:09,701 --> 01:23:10,656
This one.

1104
01:23:13,141 --> 01:23:17,020
You got that wiggly talks corn-fed
prom night white people look.

1105
01:23:17,221 --> 01:23:18,859
And you also got a big mouth.

1106
01:23:19,381 --> 01:23:20,609
Blindfold him.

1107
01:23:20,821 --> 01:23:22,220
Where are you taking him?

1108
01:23:22,421 --> 01:23:25,538
He's just a recruit, a rookie.
You take anybody you take me.

1109
01:23:25,901 --> 01:23:27,653
l'm gonna take you.

1110
01:23:28,101 --> 01:23:30,410
You can bet your sweet ass
l'm gonna take you.

1111
01:23:30,781 --> 01:23:33,249
l'm gonna take all of you.
But first,

1112
01:23:34,101 --> 01:23:35,580
l'm gonna deal with this one.

1113
01:23:35,821 --> 01:23:36,970
Get him out of here.

1114
01:23:37,981 --> 01:23:41,417
You don't understand.
l'm responsible for him.

1115
01:23:41,661 --> 01:23:45,097
You leave him here.
Stay here, Smith! That's an order!

1116
01:23:45,781 --> 01:23:48,170
l'm senior in command here.

1117
01:23:48,421 --> 01:23:50,571
You take me first,
you sons a bitches!

1118
01:23:51,021 --> 01:23:54,855
This is not right!
This is not correct! l know!

1119
01:23:55,461 --> 01:23:57,452
Get back here, Smith!

1120
01:23:57,701 --> 01:24:01,250
l'm gonna kick your ass so far out
of the department of corrections

1121
01:24:01,461 --> 01:24:04,976
you won't fucking work
from here to San Quentin!

1122
01:24:18,621 --> 01:24:20,452
lf you're gonna do something to me,

1123
01:24:20,781 --> 01:24:25,013
l want a chance to write to my dad
and to my wife and say goodbye.

1124
01:24:25,221 --> 01:24:28,213
We ain't gonna kill you.
Not yet, anyhow.

1125
01:24:29,261 --> 01:24:31,377
We gonna put you on TV.

1126
01:24:31,901 --> 01:24:33,892
Maybe you got nothing to say to me,

1127
01:24:34,261 --> 01:24:37,458
but you gonna tell Governor
Rockefeller we mean business.

1128
01:24:38,061 --> 01:24:41,292
We want amnesty,
we want a plane waiting

1129
01:24:41,501 --> 01:24:43,969
to take every man
who wants to go to Africa.

1130
01:24:44,381 --> 01:24:48,169
You tell Rockefeller
he got to come up here in person.

1131
01:24:48,701 --> 01:24:51,169
Make sure his goons
don't take no reprisals

1132
01:24:51,381 --> 01:24:53,576
on any man who wants to stay.

1133
01:24:54,621 --> 01:24:56,020
You putting me on TV?

1134
01:24:56,261 --> 01:24:58,217
We gotta put a face on it, man.

1135
01:25:03,221 --> 01:25:05,974
They got to know
who's gonna be paying

1136
01:25:06,261 --> 01:25:08,491
if the governor don't come through.

1137
01:25:09,781 --> 01:25:13,660
We signed petitions, they didn't
listen. We played it their way...

1138
01:25:13,901 --> 01:25:17,291
We told them this was coming down,
you understand me?

1139
01:25:17,501 --> 01:25:20,538
We told them this was coming down

1140
01:25:20,741 --> 01:25:23,813
and they didn't listen.
You wanna know something?

1141
01:25:27,541 --> 01:25:29,532
They still ain't listening.

1142
01:25:30,901 --> 01:25:32,619
Got somebody here
who wants to speak.

1143
01:25:37,741 --> 01:25:39,572
My name is Michael Smith.

1144
01:25:42,221 --> 01:25:44,098
l got a message for
Governor Rockefeller.

1145
01:25:45,621 --> 01:25:48,454
They want a plane
to take them to Africa,

1146
01:25:48,661 --> 01:25:50,492
and they want that the governor

1147
01:25:50,741 --> 01:25:53,380
comes here in person
to guarantee

1148
01:25:53,621 --> 01:25:56,977
that there's no reprisals
on the men who stay behind.

1149
01:25:59,221 --> 01:26:01,974
They'll start killing us if they
don't get the answer that they want.

1150
01:26:02,221 --> 01:26:05,338
What about these stories about
atrocities? Guards being tortured?

1151
01:26:06,341 --> 01:26:08,901
No, there's been nothing like that.

1152
01:26:09,101 --> 01:26:12,457
Have any of the guards been
mistreated here? Have you been?

1153
01:26:13,221 --> 01:26:16,850
Well, we've been kept in the yard
4 days. We didn't want to be here.

1154
01:26:17,061 --> 01:26:18,813
Have you been mistreated?

1155
01:26:20,821 --> 01:26:23,289
They gave us food and water
and protection.

1156
01:26:24,021 --> 01:26:26,012
-Have the hostages lost hope?
-No.

1157
01:26:26,261 --> 01:26:30,573
We're just taking each hour as it
comes, we expect to get out of this.

1158
01:26:30,901 --> 01:26:32,300
All right, that's it, let's go.

1159
01:26:33,261 --> 01:26:36,298
Do you have a message for anyone,
Michael? Personal message?

1160
01:26:39,701 --> 01:26:42,579
l don't know if my wife
is watching this,

1161
01:26:43,501 --> 01:26:44,570
but...

1162
01:26:45,021 --> 01:26:47,535
l want her to know
that l'm thinking about her.

1163
01:26:47,741 --> 01:26:49,493
And the baby she's gonna have.

1164
01:26:49,701 --> 01:26:50,531
And...

1165
01:26:54,061 --> 01:26:56,655
if this doesn't go...

1166
01:26:57,461 --> 01:26:58,894
the way we want it to go,

1167
01:26:59,141 --> 01:27:03,293
l want her to know l wanted to spend
more time with her and see my son.

1168
01:27:06,181 --> 01:27:07,819
All right, show's over.
Come on.

1169
01:27:08,021 --> 01:27:09,932
lt ain't right keeping us here.

1170
01:27:10,141 --> 01:27:13,213
l mean, there's a lot of things
wrong here.

1171
01:27:13,421 --> 01:27:15,776
And they need fixing,
but this isn't the way to do it.

1172
01:27:15,981 --> 01:27:19,291
l mean, getting a knife
stuck at your throat...

1173
01:27:19,501 --> 01:27:22,538
having to crap before everybody,
that's a human rights thing too.

1174
01:27:22,781 --> 01:27:26,296
But l understand a man doesn't stop
being a man because he's in here.

1175
01:27:28,501 --> 01:27:30,651
Why shouldn't he have
more than one shower a week

1176
01:27:30,861 --> 01:27:33,773
and get to have some contact
with the guards?

1177
01:27:34,021 --> 01:27:36,057
And he shouldn't have to be
in a cell with a clogged up toilet.

1178
01:27:37,021 --> 01:27:40,536
God, l hope this is over soon.
We can't take much more of this.

1179
01:27:40,741 --> 01:27:44,177
And if you come in here with guns,
a lot of folks ain't going home.

1180
01:27:54,261 --> 01:27:55,660
Why did you say that?

1181
01:27:56,301 --> 01:27:58,769
You trying to get
some special favors?

1182
01:27:58,981 --> 01:28:01,973
l said what you told me to say.
Amnesty, Rockefeller.

1183
01:28:02,181 --> 01:28:03,614
No, that other shit.

1184
01:28:03,821 --> 01:28:06,096
-They asked me and l told them.
-Do you believe that?

1185
01:28:06,301 --> 01:28:08,019
Why would l lie?

1186
01:28:10,581 --> 01:28:12,890
You know something?
You're crazy, and they're crazy.

1187
01:28:13,141 --> 01:28:14,460
You want amnesty for Willis

1188
01:28:14,701 --> 01:28:17,340
but you know they're not gonna put
2,000 of you up on trial.

1189
01:28:17,541 --> 01:28:19,213
You drop that demand,
we can walk out of here.

1190
01:28:20,461 --> 01:28:22,417
Wiesbad is over there

1191
01:28:22,661 --> 01:28:24,936
trying to figure out
how to put me up on a charge.

1192
01:28:25,341 --> 01:28:27,457
You know something?
Maybe l'm craziest of all.

1193
01:28:27,661 --> 01:28:30,380
Because l came to work here
for the overtime!

1194
01:28:30,581 --> 01:28:31,980
And l shut my eyes

1195
01:28:32,221 --> 01:28:33,734
to what goes on in here
and l started

1196
01:28:33,941 --> 01:28:37,138
doing to my wife exactly what
l saw my father doing to my mother.

1197
01:28:38,421 --> 01:28:40,537
Maybe l'm craziest of all.

1198
01:28:40,741 --> 01:28:43,574
Because l'm trying to talk a crazy
man out of his craziness...

1199
01:28:43,821 --> 01:28:45,015
Don't call me crazy.

1200
01:28:45,221 --> 01:28:48,497
We could walk out of here right now,
but you'd rather die than do that.

1201
01:28:48,741 --> 01:28:50,015
That sounds pretty crazy to me.

1202
01:28:50,221 --> 01:28:52,257
We want respect.
We want dignity.

1203
01:28:52,461 --> 01:28:54,895
You are gonna get blown away.

1204
01:28:55,341 --> 01:28:57,536
Do you understand?
You see the people up there?

1205
01:28:58,661 --> 01:29:01,459
l grew up here.
l understand these people.

1206
01:29:01,661 --> 01:29:02,855
l know my people.

1207
01:29:03,061 --> 01:29:04,733
-What do you know about us?
-What do you know about us?

1208
01:29:06,501 --> 01:29:08,139
You see, l can't talk to you.

1209
01:29:08,381 --> 01:29:10,941
l can't make you understand.
You are one stubborn son of a bitch.

1210
01:29:11,141 --> 01:29:13,735
-We got to play this to the bust.
-My kid has more sense than you,

1211
01:29:14,021 --> 01:29:15,693
he ain't even been born yet.

1212
01:29:15,981 --> 01:29:16,811
Come here.

1213
01:29:19,021 --> 01:29:20,693
l got something l wanna show you.

1214
01:29:23,141 --> 01:29:23,937
Go on.

1215
01:29:25,261 --> 01:29:26,216
Wait.

1216
01:29:39,741 --> 01:29:41,459
We were gonna do it different.

1217
01:29:44,261 --> 01:29:46,411
We were gonna show

1218
01:29:47,301 --> 01:29:48,780
how it could be.

1219
01:29:50,461 --> 01:29:52,656
Then we got nowhere talking,

1220
01:29:53,181 --> 01:29:55,058
and it started breaking up.

1221
01:29:57,301 --> 01:30:00,418
Somebody takes his payback
on a snitch,

1222
01:30:01,381 --> 01:30:03,178
then somebody else.

1223
01:30:05,981 --> 01:30:07,619
This fool here,

1224
01:30:08,421 --> 01:30:11,970
he just wanted to cut somebody
and we couldn't make him see reason.

1225
01:30:16,941 --> 01:30:19,978
lt wasn't meant to be like this.

1226
01:30:23,661 --> 01:30:25,777
This was Attica.

1227
01:30:29,261 --> 01:30:30,489
lt was something else.

1228
01:30:38,341 --> 01:30:40,059
You'd better get on back.

1229
01:32:26,981 --> 01:32:28,699
Okay, let's see what we have.

1230
01:32:34,061 --> 01:32:36,700
l told you l'd be coming back
for you, didn't l?

1231
01:32:36,981 --> 01:32:37,857
Him!

1232
01:32:38,261 --> 01:32:40,411
Must be my winning personality.

1233
01:33:04,861 --> 01:33:06,135
Mr. Oswald!

1234
01:33:06,541 --> 01:33:09,738
Sir, l've got a brother and a son in
there. You said you'd do something,

1235
01:33:09,941 --> 01:33:13,058
so goddamnit, just do it!
Whatever it takes, just do it!

1236
01:33:13,741 --> 01:33:15,220
lt's out of my hands.

1237
01:33:27,581 --> 01:33:30,015
Move, move, move! Double time!

1238
01:33:47,741 --> 01:33:49,094
What are those?

1239
01:33:50,221 --> 01:33:51,370
Body bags.

1240
01:33:51,981 --> 01:33:54,336
Weaned themselves.
Corn-fed.

1241
01:33:54,741 --> 01:33:56,459
White picket fence.

1242
01:34:00,861 --> 01:34:04,376
l put up with them burning their
bras, playing that crazy music...

1243
01:34:04,581 --> 01:34:06,173
their long hair
and flaired trousers,

1244
01:34:06,381 --> 01:34:09,612
and them going on the pill so they
could do it whenever they want.

1245
01:34:09,861 --> 01:34:13,171
Everyone's talking about his rights,
nobody cares about mine.

1246
01:34:13,381 --> 01:34:16,453
l been waiting for this day.
This is get it right day!

1247
01:34:16,701 --> 01:34:18,896
This is where it stops.
lt stops right here.

1248
01:34:20,221 --> 01:34:21,734
Our guys are in there.

1249
01:34:21,941 --> 01:34:24,057
Then they just gotta
take their chances, don't they?

1250
01:34:45,621 --> 01:34:47,293
How's it going, prom night?

1251
01:34:49,421 --> 01:34:51,491
Just do what you gotta do
and cut the bullshit.

1252
01:34:53,021 --> 01:34:54,215
Give me that.

1253
01:34:54,901 --> 01:34:56,937
-l'll take care of him.
-No, l got him.

1254
01:34:57,661 --> 01:34:59,299
No, l got him. He's mine.

1255
01:35:10,181 --> 01:35:11,978
l'll do it quick and clean.

1256
01:35:13,021 --> 01:35:15,012
-You promise?
-Promise.

1257
01:35:17,141 --> 01:35:20,099
-l don't wanna be flopping around.
-Don't worry.

1258
01:35:20,381 --> 01:35:21,894
l'll do you right.

1259
01:35:52,461 --> 01:35:53,530
They cut the power.

1260
01:35:57,861 --> 01:36:02,013
lf you make it out of here and l
don't, tell my family l cared.

1261
01:36:02,221 --> 01:36:04,735
They gotta know l cared
and l was thinking about them.

1262
01:36:07,861 --> 01:36:10,580
Will you do the same for me?
Will you tell my wife?

1263
01:36:11,061 --> 01:36:12,892
Yeah, l promise.

1264
01:36:19,301 --> 01:36:20,529
He's here.

1265
01:36:23,221 --> 01:36:25,781
We did it. We did it.
They listened.

1266
01:36:26,341 --> 01:36:27,376
He came!

1267
01:36:31,581 --> 01:36:32,491
All right, it's the guy!

1268
01:36:42,861 --> 01:36:44,692
Throw down your weapons!

1269
01:36:45,261 --> 01:36:47,616
You will not be mistreated!

1270
01:36:48,341 --> 01:36:50,059
You have nothing to fear!

1271
01:36:52,061 --> 01:36:52,698
Look out!

1272
01:36:53,981 --> 01:36:55,937
Gas! Gas!

1273
01:36:57,181 --> 01:36:58,933
Stupid pricks!

1274
01:36:59,141 --> 01:37:00,369
Too damp for gas!

1275
01:37:03,701 --> 01:37:05,054
Beautiful.

1276
01:37:05,541 --> 01:37:06,769
That's just so beautiful.

1277
01:37:07,021 --> 01:37:08,454
They're dropping gas!

1278
01:37:10,581 --> 01:37:12,299
Get the hell out! Move!

1279
01:37:42,421 --> 01:37:43,615
Who gave the order to fire?

1280
01:37:45,901 --> 01:37:47,892
Dig in, men! Dig in!

1281
01:37:48,381 --> 01:37:49,939
This is really great!

1282
01:37:51,661 --> 01:37:52,537
Stay down Michael!

1283
01:37:52,741 --> 01:37:53,730

1284
01:38:11,061 --> 01:38:12,972

1285
01:38:15,661 --> 01:38:17,458
Stop it! Stop it! Stop it!

1286
01:38:19,021 --> 01:38:21,535
You'll kill everybody,
you cocksuckers!

1287
01:38:22,101 --> 01:38:23,932
Just like Vietnam!

1288
01:38:41,141 --> 01:38:43,609
Fuck this shit!

1289
01:39:56,781 --> 01:39:57,930
Stay down, Michael.

1290
01:40:03,421 --> 01:40:04,536

1291
01:40:14,021 --> 01:40:14,897
Crawl!

1292
01:40:15,421 --> 01:40:16,695
Crawl like a worm l said!

1293
01:40:18,101 --> 01:40:19,819
Help! l'm a guard!

1294
01:40:20,981 --> 01:40:23,415
-This the son of a bitch did it?
-Tell him what l did for you!

1295
01:40:23,661 --> 01:40:24,980
He saved my life.

1296
01:40:25,181 --> 01:40:27,251
-How many throats did he cut?
-He saved my life.

1297
01:40:27,461 --> 01:40:29,053
That's my buddy, mister!

1298
01:40:29,621 --> 01:40:30,770
Him too?

1299
01:40:32,701 --> 01:40:34,214
l'll be back.

1300
01:40:34,421 --> 01:40:36,457
Drop that shell
and l'll blow you away.

1301
01:40:37,181 --> 01:40:38,694
Hang in there, Mikey.

1302
01:40:39,021 --> 01:40:40,818
Here, get him out of here.

1303
01:40:45,101 --> 01:40:46,659
Don't forget what you said.

1304
01:40:47,821 --> 01:40:50,972
l didn't see you, Mikey.
Hang in there, we'll get you out.

1305
01:40:51,421 --> 01:40:52,979
Fucking lousy...

1306
01:40:53,181 --> 01:40:55,251
Hang in there, Mikey.
We're gonna make it.

1307
01:41:01,701 --> 01:41:03,896
Move back.
Please get behind the line.

1308
01:41:04,101 --> 01:41:07,332
This is a police line,
please move back.

1309
01:41:15,661 --> 01:41:17,777
lt appears they brought
someone out.

1310
01:41:29,461 --> 01:41:31,770
Get the hell out of here.

1311
01:41:35,741 --> 01:41:37,413
Ed didn't make it.

1312
01:41:38,261 --> 01:41:40,092
Don't try to talk, son.

1313
01:41:40,461 --> 01:41:42,656
l couldn't do anything.

1314
01:41:45,541 --> 01:41:46,496
Stop it!

1315
01:41:48,581 --> 01:41:52,369
You are not leaving here
without my husband!

1316
01:41:53,941 --> 01:41:56,409
Get down here and help me!

1317
01:41:56,821 --> 01:41:58,254
Get him up, come on!

1318
01:42:02,301 --> 01:42:04,337
Here, listen to me.

1319
01:42:04,581 --> 01:42:07,493
No one's ever gonna ask you about
what happened in there. Look at me.

1320
01:42:07,741 --> 01:42:10,892
Not Sharon, not me and not Michael.
You understand?

1321
01:42:11,141 --> 01:42:13,132
This whole thing was a mess,
fucked up from the top down,

1322
01:42:13,381 --> 01:42:15,576
l don't wanna ever hear anything
more about it.

1323
01:42:15,781 --> 01:42:16,850
All right?
