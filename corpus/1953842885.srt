171
00:13:04,918 --> 00:13:07,819
Also, there's no locks on
the doors so...

172
00:13:07,821 --> 00:13:10,188
If you see a door closed
knock don't just walk in.

173
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:12,423
Um, Nick, Dean,

174
00:13:12,425 --> 00:13:13,458
we're going
to need to go get
some fire wood

175
00:13:13,460 --> 00:13:15,326
it's going to be
a cold weekend.

176
00:13:15,328 --> 00:13:17,262
No problem, man.

177
00:13:17,264 --> 00:13:20,298
Hey your dad's place is
amazing, man.

178
00:13:20,300 --> 00:13:22,233
-Spend a lot of time
here growing up?
-Not really.

179
00:13:23,869 --> 00:13:26,070
Why not, man?
I know I would have.

180
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,339
Camping but,
that's about it.

181
00:13:28,341 --> 00:13:29,841
So not too many times
then, huh?

182
00:13:29,843 --> 00:13:32,310
Nah. I guess I was
kind of a bitter kid.

183
00:13:32,312 --> 00:13:33,378
-You're still are
a bitter kid.
-AIDEN: Get out of my house.

184
00:13:38,184 --> 00:13:41,419
Oh, you really went
all out for Halloween.

185
00:13:41,421 --> 00:13:45,089
We Wiccans prefer to call
this time of year, Samhain.

186
00:13:45,091 --> 00:13:46,891
-Samhain?
-Yeah, it's like
our New Year.

187
00:13:50,429 --> 00:13:52,931
Don't worry
I'm not going to cast
any spells on you.

188
00:13:52,933 --> 00:13:54,432
Thank you.

189
00:13:54,434 --> 00:13:57,335
This is my favorite
time of year.

190
00:13:57,337 --> 00:14:01,306
I brought so many fun goodies,
but first we have to
prepare them.

191
00:14:01,308 --> 00:14:01,973
-Do you want to help
with the pumpkin?
-Sure.

192
00:14:13,018 --> 00:14:14,619
What are you most afraid of?

193
00:14:16,355 --> 00:14:18,356
-TESS: Huh?
-What's one of
your greatest fears?

194
00:14:19,558 --> 00:14:21,326
Um...

195
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,428
I hope this isn't like
creeping you out right now.

196
00:14:23,430 --> 00:14:25,930
MEL: I just really like to get
to know people
through their fears.

197
00:14:27,233 --> 00:14:29,467
Okay. Uh, well,
to be honest...

198
00:14:31,503 --> 00:14:35,106
I am deathly afraid
of closed spaces.

199
00:14:35,108 --> 00:14:37,308
Ah, so you're claustrophobic.

200
00:14:37,310 --> 00:14:39,110
Yeah, I guess
you could say that.

201
00:14:39,645 --> 00:14:40,612
I...

202
00:14:41,513 --> 00:14:43,414
I am terrified of elevators.

203
00:14:45,484 --> 00:14:48,019
-How embarrassing.
-No, no, don't be embarrassed.

204
00:14:50,256 --> 00:14:51,956
I'm terrified of the dark.

205
00:14:53,292 --> 00:14:56,427
So, if we were trapped
in an elevator

206
00:14:56,429 --> 00:14:58,396
and suddenly
the lights went out,
we would be done for.

207
00:14:58,398 --> 00:15:00,331
Exactly!

208
00:15:01,200 --> 00:15:02,400
Okay.

209
00:15:05,371 --> 00:15:09,374
Doctor, Mr. Pumpkin-head's
brains are ready
for extraction.

210
00:15:11,176 --> 00:15:13,511
Just reach in and grab
handfuls of brains.

211
00:15:15,281 --> 00:15:18,016
Put them in the bowl
and go like this.

212
00:15:18,018 --> 00:15:20,151
Squeeze all the seeds
away from the guts, okay?

213
00:15:20,153 --> 00:15:23,121
(CHUCKLES) Okay.

214
00:15:23,123 --> 00:15:25,189
I've never actually
had toasted pumpkin seeds
before. So...

215
00:15:25,191 --> 00:15:26,291
-MEL: Really?
-TESS: Yeah.

216
00:15:26,293 --> 00:15:27,959
MEL: They are so yummy.

217
00:15:27,961 --> 00:15:30,094
But first it is
important to know that

218
00:15:31,530 --> 00:15:36,067
we can't do any physical labor
without a bit of this.

219
00:15:37,670 --> 00:15:39,604
-TESS: It's a bit early.
-Who's going to know?

220
00:15:41,106 --> 00:15:42,073
(BOTH CHUCKLING)

221
00:15:49,114 --> 00:15:51,215
So tell me
a little more about...

222
00:15:52,952 --> 00:15:55,420
-Samhain?
-Samhain. (WHEEZING)

223
00:15:55,422 --> 00:15:57,021
Well, it's like a...
(GASPS)

224
00:15:59,158 --> 00:16:01,326
-Are you okay?
-(GASPING)

225
00:16:01,328 --> 00:16:03,027
(USING INHALER)

226
00:16:03,029 --> 00:16:04,028
Mel?

227
00:16:06,265 --> 00:16:07,265
(EXHALES)

228
00:16:07,267 --> 00:16:08,566
(COUGHS)

229
00:16:12,671 --> 00:16:16,574
Samhain is a, uh,
Wiccan ritual

230
00:16:16,576 --> 00:16:20,511
-dating back to way
before Christianization.
-Mmm-hmm.

231
00:16:20,513 --> 00:16:23,014
I know what you might
be thinking
when I say "Wiccan".

232
00:16:23,016 --> 00:16:25,650
You're thinking witch
and witches are evil.

233
00:16:25,652 --> 00:16:29,053
Oh, no, trust me,
I have a very open mind.

234
00:16:29,055 --> 00:16:31,489
If you split up
the year into two

235
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:34,625
and label one half as light
and the other half as dark

236
00:16:34,627 --> 00:16:37,195
Samhain is the end of
the light half of the year

237
00:16:37,197 --> 00:16:39,030
and the beginning
of the dark half.

238
00:16:39,032 --> 00:16:41,499
It's uh...

239
00:16:41,501 --> 00:16:44,068
Also a time to honor the ones
who have passed.

240
00:16:45,504 --> 00:16:47,238
Crossed over
to the other side.

241
00:16:50,242 --> 00:16:51,609
TESS: Let me put those
beers away for you.

242
00:16:51,611 --> 00:16:52,710
MEL: Oh, thank you.

243
00:16:53,545 --> 00:16:55,013
Oh, gross.

244
00:16:56,315 --> 00:16:59,217
Okay, that is nasty.

245
00:16:59,219 --> 00:17:01,085
Ew, Tess, don't put
your arm in there.

246
00:17:01,087 --> 00:17:02,387
I don't think
that it's even on.

247
00:17:03,422 --> 00:17:05,156
Ugh.

248
00:17:05,158 --> 00:17:07,392
Um, Aiden, come over here
and check this out.

249
00:17:09,094 --> 00:17:10,294
That's weird.

250
00:17:12,598 --> 00:17:15,133
Hey, has anyone tried
turning on the lights yet?

251
00:17:15,135 --> 00:17:16,434
TESS: No, not yet.

252
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:19,637
Shit.

253
00:17:20,506 --> 00:17:22,140
TESS: Power outage?

254
00:17:22,142 --> 00:17:25,777
Yeah, either that
or a fuse blew.

255
00:17:25,779 --> 00:17:30,548
We're still supposed to have
power this time of year.
Just a second.

256
00:17:30,550 --> 00:17:33,618
Hey, Nick, um, hey,
could you try flicking
that light on for me?

257
00:17:33,620 --> 00:17:34,419
Sure.

258
00:17:38,524 --> 00:17:39,590
<i>Nada.</i>

259
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:45,096
The oven seems to
be working just fine.

260
00:17:46,432 --> 00:17:49,167
That's 'cause it's gas.

261
00:17:49,169 --> 00:17:53,171
Hmm... Trapped on an island
on Halloween weekend
and now no lights?

262
00:17:54,406 --> 00:17:57,241
What could possibly
happen next?

263
00:17:57,243 --> 00:18:01,512
Well, next we prepare for
a weekend in the dark.

264
00:18:01,514 --> 00:18:04,082
Hey, Tess, could you help me
get some flashlights?

265
00:18:04,084 --> 00:18:06,517
And Nick, Dean,
we're going to need
more firewood.

266
00:18:12,491 --> 00:18:13,691
Watch your step.

267
00:18:20,599 --> 00:18:22,233
And here's your room,
<i>mademoiselle.</i>

268
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:29,107
Just leave this here
for ya and...
-Thanks.

269
00:18:29,109 --> 00:18:32,110
-I'll just be around
getting some flashlights.
-Okay.

270
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:46,244
NICK: Hey, Tess,
you want to see
a magic trick?

271
00:20:46,246 --> 00:20:48,246
Yeah.

272
00:20:48,248 --> 00:20:49,680
NICK: Aiden, could you get me
a piece of paper
and a pencil?

273
00:20:49,682 --> 00:20:51,349
AIDEN: Yeah,
I'll be right back.

274
00:20:51,351 --> 00:20:52,316
Okay.

275
00:20:55,254 --> 00:20:58,022
-(EXHALES)
Pick a card, any card.
-Okay.

276
00:20:59,992 --> 00:21:01,959
-I'll take this one.
-Okay.

277
00:21:01,961 --> 00:21:03,894
Now take a look at it.
Memorize it.

278
00:21:06,498 --> 00:21:08,799
Great now put it back
in the deck.
Anywhere you like.

279
00:21:10,335 --> 00:21:11,469
-Okay.
-Okay...

280
00:21:12,938 --> 00:21:14,872
Now...

281
00:21:14,874 --> 00:21:16,674
-AIDEN: Here you go.
-Ah, perfect. Thank you.

282
00:21:18,010 --> 00:21:20,645
All right. Now...

283
00:21:20,647 --> 00:21:22,546
DEAN: I think,
I've seen this one.

284
00:21:22,548 --> 00:21:25,049
No, you haven't.
I need to write it down.

285
00:21:25,051 --> 00:21:27,652
-Write down your card
on that piece of paper.
-Okay.

286
00:21:27,654 --> 00:21:29,453
And then just crumple it up.

287
00:21:32,457 --> 00:21:34,458
-Crumple it?
-Crumple it.
There you go.

288
00:21:35,327 --> 00:21:36,727
Thank you. All right.

289
00:21:38,463 --> 00:21:39,563
(EXHALES)

290
00:21:49,308 --> 00:21:50,808
-AIDEN: Hey, don't burn
my house down.
-(NICK CHUCKLES)

291
00:21:50,810 --> 00:21:54,779
And now, ladies and gents,
let the river of magic flow.

292
00:21:57,349 --> 00:21:59,583
Nick!

293
00:21:59,585 --> 00:22:01,552
All right, now I need you
to check through your deck

294
00:22:01,554 --> 00:22:03,087
because your card is missing.

295
00:22:16,535 --> 00:22:18,469
Where'd it go?

296
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,072
The trick isn't over yet.

297
00:22:21,074 --> 00:22:23,107
All right,
now I need you
to take my hand.

298
00:22:23,109 --> 00:22:25,009
-Okay.
-The other hand.

299
00:22:25,011 --> 00:22:26,977
-The hand that
you wrote with.
-Okay.

300
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:30,915
All right, now I need
you to imagine the card

301
00:22:30,917 --> 00:22:33,851
going from your mind
to your arm
and into my arm.

302
00:22:33,853 --> 00:22:35,519
-Can you do that?
-Okay.

303
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:37,455
-Got it?
-Yeah.

304
00:22:37,457 --> 00:22:39,390
All right, we'll see. Now...

305
00:22:53,905 --> 00:22:56,674
-Was that your card?
-DEAN: Dude, you're one
seriously freaky...

306
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:59,143
That was my card.

307
00:22:59,145 --> 00:23:01,912
Thank you. Thank you.
Please, please,
no standing ovations.

308
00:23:01,914 --> 00:23:04,448
-Nick, how did you...
-Very, very spooky.

309
00:23:05,817 --> 00:23:09,153
Well, it's about to get
even spookier.

310
00:23:09,155 --> 00:23:12,556
This, my friends, will be
the icing on the cake
for such an evening.

311
00:23:12,558 --> 00:23:14,792
I have been dying to know,
what is in here.

312
00:23:14,794 --> 00:23:16,827
MEL: Well, wonder no more.

313
00:23:16,829 --> 00:23:19,730
This is an original
oracle board,

314
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,600
or talking board,
or Ouija or whatever
you want to call it.

315
00:23:22,602 --> 00:23:25,503
My mom always told me
that these things
were dangerous.

316
00:23:25,505 --> 00:23:27,772
No, the boards themselves
are not dangerous.

317
00:23:27,774 --> 00:23:29,507
But some people
may misuse them,

318
00:23:29,509 --> 00:23:31,075
like the way they communicate
through them.

319
00:23:31,077 --> 00:23:33,577
NICK: Tess, you have nothing
to worry about.

320
00:23:33,579 --> 00:23:35,579
-They don't even work.
-(MEL SCOFFS)

321
00:23:35,581 --> 00:23:38,682
How do you know?
Nick, have you played?

322
00:23:38,684 --> 00:23:40,985
Well, scratch that,
they do work,

323
00:23:40,987 --> 00:23:43,788
but its mysteries
don't lie in the realm
of the paranormal.

324
00:23:43,790 --> 00:23:45,689
It's more of
a psychological
phenomenon.

325
00:23:45,691 --> 00:23:47,625
MEL: Well, different strokes
for different folks.

326
00:23:47,627 --> 00:23:49,059
Come on, Tess, it'll be fun.

327
00:23:49,061 --> 00:23:52,496
Wait, what do you mean
"psychological phenomenon"?

328
00:23:52,498 --> 00:23:54,432
Well, as the obvious
would suggest,

329
00:23:54,434 --> 00:23:57,134
you can see
I'm a budding magician.

330
00:23:57,136 --> 00:24:00,438
I'm very interested
in mastering the psychological
aspect of magic.

331
00:24:00,440 --> 00:24:03,541
It's a pivotal tool to have
in order to pull off
a great trick.

332
00:24:03,543 --> 00:24:06,544
Nick, you're sucking the
magic out of Halloween.

333
00:24:06,546 --> 00:24:08,212
No, I still think
that this is fun,

334
00:24:08,214 --> 00:24:11,549
but just in a different way.

335
00:24:11,551 --> 00:24:14,118
I'm still curious about
the psychological
component, though.

336
00:24:16,588 --> 00:24:19,023
Well, not to drag this on
all night,

337
00:24:19,025 --> 00:24:22,493
but big brains such as
Faraday, Chevreul, James,

338
00:24:22,495 --> 00:24:25,596
and my favorite,
and most modern, Ray Hyman.

339
00:24:25,598 --> 00:24:29,733
Have conducted studies of
a phenomenon known as
ideomotor action.

340
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,703
In regard to the movement
of the little triangle thing

341
00:24:32,705 --> 00:24:36,073
around the board
or whatever one would
use to play the game,

342
00:24:36,075 --> 00:24:39,009
scientific studies have been
conducted and concluded
that ordinary,

343
00:24:40,912 --> 00:24:43,981
smart people like ourselves

344
00:24:43,983 --> 00:24:46,550
can participate
in muscular activity
that is...

345
00:24:46,552 --> 00:24:49,019
That is consistent
with their expectations.

346
00:24:49,021 --> 00:24:51,956
So basically your ghost
is nothing more than
unconscious muscle movement

347
00:24:51,958 --> 00:24:54,024
guided by your expectations.

348
00:24:54,026 --> 00:24:55,993
Wow, how boring.

349
00:24:55,995 --> 00:24:58,996
Dude, seriously,
it's more fun to think

350
00:24:58,998 --> 00:25:00,865
that there's actually
a ghost in there
guiding my hands around.

351
00:25:00,867 --> 00:25:04,635
But I heard so many horror
stories about these things.

352
00:25:04,637 --> 00:25:08,606
Ah, but do not underestimate
the power of the mind.

353
00:25:08,608 --> 00:25:10,841
For some that idea
is even scarier.

354
00:25:12,177 --> 00:25:13,944
Here let's focus.
Tess, you in?

355
00:25:16,915 --> 00:25:20,718
Sure, but I'm going to be
more of a passive observer.

356
00:25:20,720 --> 00:25:22,953
Great, but you can't
be too passive.

357
00:25:22,955 --> 00:25:27,258
I need you to record
every letter that the
planchette moves onto.

358
00:25:27,260 --> 00:25:29,793
Aiden, can we have pen
and paper, please?

359
00:25:29,795 --> 00:25:32,029
Thank you.

360
00:25:32,031 --> 00:25:33,697
Okay, first we have
to protect ourselves
from any negative energy.

361
00:25:39,804 --> 00:25:40,871
All right, let's begin.

362
00:25:42,140 --> 00:25:44,542
Please protect us
from anything

363
00:25:44,544 --> 00:25:47,678
that has either negative
energy towards us
or this house.

364
00:25:47,680 --> 00:25:49,947
May we stay safe
within the white light
for we only want to attract

365
00:25:49,949 --> 00:25:52,550
pure energies
with good intentions.

366
00:25:52,552 --> 00:25:53,717
-AIDEN: Amen.
-A toast.

367
00:25:56,288 --> 00:25:59,189
Happy Halloween and
to the end of the harvest.

368
00:25:59,191 --> 00:26:00,724
ALL: Cheers.

369
00:26:03,762 --> 00:26:05,296
Are there any sprits here
with us tonight?

370
00:26:10,702 --> 00:26:12,803
Is there anyone who would
like to talk with us tonight?

371
00:26:15,840 --> 00:26:17,641
-Boo!
-(YELPS) Dammit, Dean!

372
00:26:20,011 --> 00:26:20,811
Get off me.

373
00:26:22,314 --> 00:26:24,081
DEAN: (CHUCKLES)
I'm sorry. Sorry.

374
00:26:26,051 --> 00:26:27,351
Okay.

375
00:26:29,020 --> 00:26:30,154
Are you done?

376
00:26:31,256 --> 00:26:32,056
(LAUGHING) Okay.

377
00:26:38,630 --> 00:26:40,264
(NICK LAUGHING)

378
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,070
Are there any spirits
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

379
00:26:51,776 --> 00:26:54,378
-Dean, you have to clear
your mind.
-(LAUGHING)

380
00:26:54,380 --> 00:26:57,748
Everybody, please
clear your mind
and focus on the question.

381
00:26:57,750 --> 00:26:59,850
My mind is being cleared.

382
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:02,886
Okay.

383
00:27:06,324 --> 00:27:08,759
Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

384
00:27:13,098 --> 00:27:15,232
Um, I'm not sure
if that's a yes or not.

385
00:27:16,668 --> 00:27:17,868
Looks like a yes to me.

386
00:27:19,671 --> 00:27:21,038
What is your name?

387
00:27:23,308 --> 00:27:25,709
"D-E-D..."

388
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:31,215
"D."
It spelled out D-E-D-I-D.

389
00:27:32,350 --> 00:27:34,418
Dedid? Dedid it is.

390
00:27:36,821 --> 00:27:39,256
Dedid? What is your last name?

391
00:27:42,827 --> 00:27:43,727
"W

392
00:27:45,063 --> 00:27:45,963

Um...

398
00:27:54,906 --> 00:27:55,939
"Wahfuv?"

399
00:27:57,709 --> 00:27:59,443
MEL: Is that an English
last name?

400
00:28:02,847 --> 00:28:03,881
TESS: No.

401
00:28:05,450 --> 00:28:07,317
What kind of last name
is Wahfuv?

402
00:28:09,120 --> 00:28:10,020
"C

"Checlk?"

409
00:28:22,734 --> 00:28:24,101
Are you from
the Czech Republic?

410

(SPLUTTERS)

411
00:28:26,138 --> 00:28:28,405
How did you come up
with Czech Republic
out of "Checlk?"

412
00:28:28,407 --> 00:28:29,440
It sounds more like
a piece of gum.

413
00:28:33,845 --> 00:28:34,878
-Yes, he is.
-Ooh.

414
00:28:36,414 --> 00:28:38,015
Are you from Prague?

415
00:28:41,486 --> 00:28:44,321
TESS: It looks like no, but it
never quite got there.

416
00:28:44,323 --> 00:28:46,023
NICK: Maybe candy land.

417
00:28:48,093 --> 00:28:50,260
MEL: Are you from
somewhere else in
the Czech Republic?

418
00:28:54,332 --> 00:28:57,901
Did you move to America?

419
00:29:02,841 --> 00:29:05,509
-"Goodbye."
-Ah! You scared the poor
little Czech guy away.

420
00:29:05,511 --> 00:29:07,244
Well, it wasn't
a terrible start.

421
00:29:07,246 --> 00:29:09,113
Seriously, Dean.
You moving it?

422
00:29:10,014 --> 00:29:13,150
No, I wasn't.

423
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:17,387
Or, just a thought,
maybe you were unconsciously
pushing it around board.

424
00:29:17,389 --> 00:29:19,857
MEL: Let's try again.

425
00:29:19,859 --> 00:29:22,159
NICK: Yeah, and this time
can we get a spirit
that could actually spell?

426
00:29:22,161 --> 00:29:24,361
(ALL LAUGHING)

427
00:29:24,363 --> 00:29:26,063
MEL: I'll try my best.
Blind-folds on, come on.

428
00:29:27,198 --> 00:29:29,967
Hey.

429
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,504
-Are you freaking
kidding me?
-I didn't do it.

430
00:29:33,506 --> 00:29:37,141
Okay, come on let's just play
with our eyes closed.

431
00:29:37,143 --> 00:29:39,843
Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight.

432
00:29:40,512 --> 00:29:41,979
TESS: Yes.

433
00:29:41,981 --> 00:29:43,814
MEL: This one feels
better already.

434
00:29:44,482 --> 00:29:45,849
What is your name?

435
00:29:52,991 --> 00:29:57,194
TESS: Wow, it's legible.
Um, his name is Adam.

436
00:29:57,196 --> 00:29:59,129
Really? My cousin's name
was Adam.

437
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,567
Adam, how old are you?

438
00:30:07,472 --> 00:30:07,971
"24."

439
00:30:12,243 --> 00:30:14,278
Adam, when did you die?

440
00:30:18,416 --> 00:30:20,184
TESS: It just said "one."

441
00:30:22,954 --> 00:30:24,154
Did you die one year ago?

442
00:30:28,159 --> 00:30:29,893
It went to yes.

443
00:30:29,895 --> 00:30:31,895
AIDEN: Mel,
is that your cousin?

444
00:30:31,897 --> 00:30:33,297
I don't know, um...

445
00:30:33,299 --> 00:30:35,365
My cousin Adam died last year
when he was 24.

446
00:30:41,005 --> 00:30:42,906
Adam, are you my cousin Adam?

447
00:30:47,378 --> 00:30:49,046
Adam, are you my cousin?

448
00:30:52,483 --> 00:30:54,985
-Adam, are you there?
-Mel.

449
00:30:54,987 --> 00:30:56,486
-Adam?
-Hey, Mel, I think
it's a coincidence.

450
00:31:00,959 --> 00:31:02,392
Adam, are you still with us?

451
00:31:04,929 --> 00:31:06,997
Hey, Mel, I think he's gone.

452
00:31:10,235 --> 00:31:12,936
-TESS: Are you okay, Mel?
-Yeah, it's just...
I know it was him.

453
00:31:15,573 --> 00:31:17,074
Okay, um, sorry guys.

454
00:31:18,910 --> 00:31:21,612
Okay, let's just, um,
talk to someone else.

455
00:31:21,614 --> 00:31:25,949
Adam is gone for now.
So let's just move on.

456
00:31:25,951 --> 00:31:27,317
Is there anyone here
who would like
to talk with us tonight?

457
00:31:31,990 --> 00:31:33,457
TESS: "Yes."

458
00:31:33,459 --> 00:31:35,092
What is your name?

459
00:31:41,900 --> 00:31:43,166
TESS: His name is Oliver.

460
00:31:45,169 --> 00:31:46,937
Oliver, how old are you?

461
00:31:49,574 --> 00:31:51,909
Aww, he's only eight.

462
00:31:51,911 --> 00:31:53,410
Oh, we got a little boy.

-Hi, Oliver.
-No, no.

464
00:31:55,314 --> 00:31:57,514
-No, no, don't get any ghosts
stuck in my dad's house.
-You're fine.

pretty funny.

00:32:00,519 --> 00:32:03,153
-Yeah, maybe for you.
-MEL: Oliver, how did you die?

467
00:32:07,292 --> 00:32:08,292

468
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:11,328

469
00:32:20,071 --> 00:32:21,004
-TESS: "Game."
-MEL: Hmm.

470
00:32:22,607 --> 00:32:23,674
What kind of game?

471
00:32:28,613 --> 00:32:30,614
Just went to "choke" again.

472
00:32:30,616 --> 00:32:32,049
What the hell's
the choke game?

473
00:32:33,084 --> 00:32:34,985
The Choking Game.

474
00:32:34,987 --> 00:32:36,219
I think he means
self-asphyxiation.

475
00:32:38,056 --> 00:32:39,990
You know where you
breathe in and out
10 or so times

476
00:32:39,992 --> 00:32:44,394
and then you choke
yourself into euphoria. Mmm.

477
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:45,696
-DEAN: I'm familiar
with this game.
-You would.

478
00:32:47,265 --> 00:32:48,165
-What?
-Ugh.

479
00:32:49,500 --> 00:32:51,702
MEL: Oliver,
what year did you die?

480
00:32:54,172 --> 00:32:56,006
Oliver, when did you die?

481
00:32:58,676 --> 00:32:59,743
Maybe he was murdered.

482
00:33:05,616 --> 00:33:07,150
MEL: Oliver, what are you
doing right now?

483
00:33:13,491 --> 00:33:15,492
TESS: He's hiding.

484
00:33:15,494 --> 00:33:16,360
MEL: Are you playing
a different game?

485
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,032
Then what are you doing?

486
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:30,507
TESS: "Danger coming."

487
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:33,610
-Is that what it said?
-TESS: Yeah.

488
00:33:38,282 --> 00:33:41,485
Oliver, what do you mean
"danger coming"?

489
00:33:54,298 --> 00:33:55,399
-Hmm.
-MEL: What?

490
00:33:55,401 --> 00:33:57,401
"Go safe." With an F.

491
00:34:00,238 --> 00:34:01,338
DEAN: Go to safety?

492
00:34:02,573 --> 00:34:04,241
NICK: Or he meant "save."

493
00:34:05,309 --> 00:34:06,510
As in save yourselves.

494
00:34:09,380 --> 00:34:11,548
-(LOUD THUD)
-Holy shit.

495
00:34:11,550 --> 00:34:14,251
-(TESS GASPING)
-Is there somebody
at the door?

496

-Aiden, somebody's
knocking at your door.
-(AIDEN SHUSHING)

497
00:34:18,256 --> 00:34:20,057
All right there's
no one knocking
at the door.

498
00:34:20,059 --> 00:34:22,726
Aiden, your dad have a gun
in this house?

499
00:34:22,728 --> 00:34:25,295
Are you kidding me?
My dad's a liberal.

500
00:34:25,297 --> 00:34:27,064
-Is the door locked?
-Yes, just... Shh...

501
00:34:31,736 --> 00:34:33,570
There's no one knocking
at the door.

502
00:34:33,572 --> 00:34:36,206
It was just more of
an isolated bang.

503
00:34:36,208 --> 00:34:37,841
TESS: What?

504
00:34:37,843 --> 00:34:40,410
Aiden, you are
the man of the house.

505
00:34:40,412 --> 00:34:41,678
Go check out this isolated
bang theory of yours.

506
00:34:42,814 --> 00:34:43,814
I'll be behind you.

507
00:34:45,783 --> 00:34:46,817
Yeah.

to do with that thing, Nick?

00:36:42,301 --> 00:36:45,468
I was going to beat it
to death.

We don't know what that was.
It could still be out there.

just a tree.

519

A tree? A tree makes
an isolated bang on the door?

520

What the hell is an
isolated bang?

who killed Oliver.

686
00:46:25,516 --> 00:46:28,050
Well, see if the card's
in the deck.

687
00:46:28,052 --> 00:46:30,386
All right fine,
but I think this is
bordering on ridiculous.

688
00:46:43,467 --> 00:46:44,433
Hold on.

689
00:47:01,552 --> 00:47:03,019
-It's not here.
-DEAN: Bullshit.

690
00:47:05,556 --> 00:47:07,456
You're not playing
another trick on us?

691
00:47:07,458 --> 00:47:09,592
Yeah.

692
00:47:09,594 --> 00:47:12,195
My card was
the Ace of Spades
you find it genius.

693
00:47:12,197 --> 00:47:13,563
That's the same card
that I choose.

694
00:47:16,500 --> 00:47:18,067
Ask... Ask where
Nick's card went.

695
00:47:23,373 --> 00:47:27,176
ZoZo, where is Nick's card?

696
00:47:30,581 --> 00:47:35,017
"ZoZo...has...it"

697
00:47:40,858 --> 00:47:42,425
ZoZo, where are you?

698
00:47:49,366 --> 00:47:50,533
AIDEN: "The bathroom."

699
00:47:54,171 --> 00:47:58,241
You're in the bathroom
in this house?

700
00:48:11,121 --> 00:48:12,188
"Yes."

701
00:48:52,129 --> 00:48:53,529
NICK: Aiden, you go
check it out.

702
00:48:54,431 --> 00:48:55,665
I'm behind you.

703
00:48:56,433 --> 00:48:57,366

705
00:49:44,715 --> 00:49:47,450
There's nothing
in there, guys.

706
00:49:47,452 --> 00:49:49,652
NICK: Then what happened
to my card?

707
00:49:49,654 --> 00:49:51,654
AIDEN: Seriously, Nick,
enough with
your stupid tricks.

708
00:49:51,656 --> 00:49:53,255
Enough of what tricks?

709
00:49:53,257 --> 00:49:54,223
The card really vanished.

710
00:49:57,995 --> 00:49:59,195
What about the other bathroom?

711
00:50:28,191 --> 00:50:30,059
AIDEN: Here we are.
NICK: Same drill?

712
00:50:31,595 --> 00:50:32,628
AIDEN: Yeah.

713
00:50:49,513 --> 00:50:51,113
(SHUDDERING SOFTLY)

714
00:50:59,189 --> 00:51:02,258
-Holy Shit!
-NICK: Hey, what did you see?

715
00:51:02,260 --> 00:51:04,260
Somebody there,
there's somebody there!
(PANTING)

716
00:51:06,263 --> 00:51:08,397
DEAN: What did you see?
What did you see?

717
00:51:08,399 --> 00:51:09,465
AIDEN: It's dark!

718
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,470
DEAN: What was it, man?

719
00:51:14,472 --> 00:51:15,805
AIDEN: It was...
I don't know.

720
00:51:15,807 --> 00:51:16,539
DEAN: He's totally freaked.

721
00:51:20,744 --> 00:51:24,513
NICK: This is crazy.
Let me get in here.

722
00:51:24,515 --> 00:51:25,848
-TESS: Nick.
-MEL: No, don't.

723
00:51:28,552 --> 00:51:29,819
AIDEN: Please don't, dude.

724
00:51:32,522 --> 00:51:34,390
I'm going to get
to the bottom of this, okay?
I'm sick of this.

725
00:51:34,392 --> 00:51:35,424
I'm going to figure out
what's going on here.

726
00:51:37,160 --> 00:51:38,160
AIDEN: Take this.

727
00:51:42,499 --> 00:51:44,100
It's going to be okay.

728
00:51:45,102 --> 00:51:46,669
All right?
It's going to be okay.

729

(NICK EXHALES DEEPLY)

730
00:52:27,711 --> 00:52:29,211
Here is your ZoZo.

731
00:52:32,449 --> 00:52:35,351
MEL: Bravo. But, Nick,
where's your card?

732
00:52:39,856 --> 00:52:42,358
TESS: Let's get back up stairs
and say good-bye to the board.

733
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:43,359
It's not good
to leave it open.

734
00:53:05,782 --> 00:53:07,416
There that should do it.

735
00:53:08,518 --> 00:53:09,885
This will be
a memorable session.

736
00:53:13,323 --> 00:53:15,391
Nick, your card is gone
and it's not coming back.

737
00:53:16,493 --> 00:53:17,760
It's got to be around
here somewhere.

738
00:53:18,828 --> 00:53:19,895
I'll find it.

739
00:53:23,633 --> 00:53:26,735
Well, here's to
one freaky night.

740
00:53:35,245 --> 00:53:37,279
What?

741
00:53:37,281 --> 00:53:38,814
Nothing let's go
to bed, come on.

742
00:53:40,917 --> 00:53:42,885
Well, boys and girls,
I'm being called to arms.

743
00:53:42,887 --> 00:53:43,886

750
00:54:01,371 --> 00:54:03,706
AIDEN: Well, now,
that was an interesting
night, huh?

751
00:54:03,708 --> 00:54:05,908
It was.

752
00:54:05,910 --> 00:54:07,509
It was also
very unsettling.

753
00:54:09,813 --> 00:54:11,947
Oh, I think our imagination
just got the best of us.

754
00:54:14,251 --> 00:54:17,319
-Nick was right
about that part.
-Yeah.

755
00:54:22,025 --> 00:54:23,592
It's just that it...

756
00:54:25,528 --> 00:54:27,429
Well it's hard to explain,
but...

757
00:54:29,733 --> 00:54:31,734
It left me with
this strange feeling.

758
00:54:33,637 --> 00:54:34,670
This feeling carries
a lot of weight.

759
00:54:36,306 --> 00:54:37,973
Don't worry, Tess.

760
00:54:37,975 --> 00:54:40,576
By tomorrow morning,
you'll be a 100 percent.

-Absolutely.

May I?

Yes, you may.

764
00:54:59,562 --> 00:55:00,829
Night.

765
00:55:00,831 --> 00:55:01,897

00:59:05,174 --> 00:59:07,576
MEL: Tess, are you sure
it just wasn't like
a bad dream or something?

772
00:59:07,578 --> 00:59:11,613
I mean... I've had some
crazy realistic dreams.

773
00:59:11,615 --> 00:59:13,815
They can feel
so freaking real sometimes.

774
00:59:13,817 --> 00:59:14,850
TESS:  <i>This seemed so real.</i>

775
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:19,955
<i>It was real.</i>

776
00:59:19,957 --> 00:59:22,157
<i>It reminded of something</i>
<i>that happened to my mom,</i>

777
00:59:23,993 --> 00:59:26,194
<i>at the time she was pregt</i>
<i>with my sister.</i>

778
00:59:26,196 --> 00:59:27,729
This really freaked me out
when she told me this.

779
00:59:30,033 --> 00:59:34,836
Um, but one night
she was lying in bed

780
00:59:34,838 --> 00:59:37,906
and all of a sudden
something grabbed her ankles,

781
00:59:40,310 --> 00:59:42,210
and dragged her
off of the foot of the bed.

782
00:59:44,647 --> 00:59:46,715
She struggled to stay on

783
00:59:46,717 --> 00:59:49,184
and she even called
for my dad who was lying
right next to her.

784
00:59:51,654 --> 00:59:52,854
-He never woke up.
-Really?

785
00:59:55,024 --> 00:59:57,593
He would just think that
she had bad dreams, but...

786
01:00:00,129 --> 01:00:03,198
But he could never explain,

787
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:06,335
why in the morning
he found her on the floor
at the foot of the bed.

788
01:00:08,237 --> 01:00:09,705
Still with the sheets
wrapped tightly in her hands.

789
01:00:11,174 --> 01:00:11,873
Wow.

790
01:00:16,112 --> 01:00:17,679
The very next night,

791
01:00:19,682 --> 01:00:21,850
minutes after getting
into bed, um...

792
01:00:24,621 --> 01:00:27,089
She was overcome
by a strong force.

793
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,195
That left her
completely paralyzed.

794
01:00:34,130 --> 01:00:35,664
-Wow.
-Um...

795
01:00:37,867 --> 01:00:39,868
Kind of like
what happened to me
last night.

796
01:00:42,672 --> 01:00:44,906
She felt like something
was holding her down.

797
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:48,977
And minutes later,

798
01:00:50,046 --> 01:00:52,014
she was floating
above her body.

799
01:00:56,285 --> 01:00:59,121
She started to, um,
to crawl along the ceiling,

800
01:01:00,690 --> 01:01:01,857
to the door,

801
01:01:03,660 --> 01:01:07,262
into the hallway
and eventually
into the living room.

802
01:01:11,100 --> 01:01:13,068
She said that that's
where she witnessed

803
01:01:14,270 --> 01:01:17,906
the most horrible sight
in the world.

804
01:01:21,411 --> 01:01:23,712
There was a fire,
everywhere.

805
01:01:25,882 --> 01:01:27,783
But she said the most
disturbing part...

806
01:01:29,385 --> 01:01:31,253
...was that there was
a baby crying.

807
01:01:33,122 --> 01:01:34,256
A baby?

808
01:01:36,693 --> 01:01:39,795
She woke up
in the worst state of terror.

809
01:01:41,464 --> 01:01:44,299
And she was clutching
her stomach

810
01:01:44,301 --> 01:01:45,434
to see if the baby
was still there.

811
01:01:53,009 --> 01:01:54,042
That's creepy shit.

812
01:01:58,347 --> 01:02:01,717
You know it's kind of weird.
I mean...

813
01:02:01,719 --> 01:02:04,419
Tess, I haven't really known
you that long, but...

814
01:02:04,421 --> 01:02:05,787
I pictured you as
an only child.

815
01:02:07,724 --> 01:02:08,890
Um, I am.

816
01:02:10,960 --> 01:02:14,196
My sister died
from complications

817
01:02:14,198 --> 01:02:15,464
just three days
after being born.

818
01:02:22,505 --> 01:02:23,905
I have a secret to tell you.

819
01:02:26,008 --> 01:02:28,877
Last night when
you were having
your nightmare/dream thing,

820
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,814
I stayed up
and played the Ouija board.

821
01:02:34,183 --> 01:02:36,218
What?

822
01:02:36,220 --> 01:02:37,919
Why?

823
01:02:37,921 --> 01:02:39,221
I don't know, um...

824
01:02:40,957 --> 01:02:43,225
I had this overwhelming
urge to play it.

825
01:02:45,862 --> 01:02:47,195
I got in contact
with my cousin again.

826
01:02:49,432 --> 01:02:50,866
What do you mean?

827
01:02:53,069 --> 01:02:54,336
Adam. My cousin Adam?

828
01:02:56,005 --> 01:02:58,273
He contacted me
through the board.

829
01:02:58,275 --> 01:03:00,208
It was him.
It was him. I knew it.

830
01:03:02,211 --> 01:03:03,478
It was so nice
to talk with him.

831
01:03:04,347 --> 01:03:05,147
Oh, Mel.

832
01:03:06,015 --> 01:03:08,917
-That's amazing.
-Yeah.

833
01:03:08,919 --> 01:03:11,253
Now, that I think about it,
the really weird thing was...

834
01:03:14,257 --> 01:03:15,223
He was asking me
a lot about you.

835
01:03:16,392 --> 01:03:17,292
Me?

836
01:03:18,528 --> 01:03:21,263
Mel, he doesn't even know me.

837
01:03:22,865 --> 01:03:23,865
Why would he
be asking about me?

838
01:03:24,867 --> 01:03:27,169
I don't know. He said...

839
01:03:27,171 --> 01:03:29,538
He was saying stuff like
he thought you were
really pretty.

840
01:03:32,241 --> 01:03:35,944
And he was sad
that he wasn't still alive,
because...

841
01:03:35,946 --> 01:03:37,946
Because if I think
he were still alive

842
01:03:37,948 --> 01:03:38,446
he would wanted to go
on a date with you.

843
01:03:41,551 --> 01:03:44,252
Mel, he doesn't even know
what I look like.

844
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,422
Why would he
be asking about me?

845
01:03:49,058 --> 01:03:51,026
You were sitting right
across from me

846
01:03:51,028 --> 01:03:52,227
when he contacted us
the first time, Tess.

847
01:03:54,997 --> 01:03:56,565
Look at you.
You're beautiful.

848
01:03:57,867 --> 01:03:59,868
In the likeness of
a true Goddess.

849
01:04:01,103 --> 01:04:02,270
Lucky me.

850
01:04:05,441 --> 01:04:08,343
Let's go bury apple seeds
and celebrate this day.

851
01:04:08,345 --> 01:04:09,878
-Come on.
-Bury apple seeds?

852
01:04:09,880 --> 01:04:11,446
Yeah, let's go.
Come on, Tess.

853
01:04:13,282 --> 01:04:16,051
-Come on. Come on.
Come on!
-TESS: Okay!

854
01:04:18,287 --> 01:04:20,856
-Where do you want
to bury them?
-Because it's fun!

855
01:04:21,524 --> 01:04:22,557
Celebrate.

856
01:04:27,396 --> 01:04:28,396
Let's go.

857
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,300
TESS: Oh, my God, be careful.
Don't slide.

of culinary school.

But how, I thought
you guys were all
the same age.

925
01:08:59,402 --> 01:09:00,869
Not me.
I'm a couple years older
than the rest of the guys.

you guys all meet?

met Aiden first.

928

Yeah, he at the time was, uh,
volunteer ambulance guy...

929
01:09:17,853 --> 01:09:20,522
And there was a time
when I wasn't sleeping
too good.

Well to make
a long story short,

931

are not the best mix.

Aiden here,
basically saved my life.

it was a long time ago, and...

Is it like moonshine?
