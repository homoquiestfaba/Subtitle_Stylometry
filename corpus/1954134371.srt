1
00:00:46,679 --> 00:00:53,414
A QUEDA DO PODER
- The Magnificent Ambersons -

2
00:02:17,137 --> 00:02:18,365
This way.

3
00:02:44,297 --> 00:02:45,594
Good evening.

4
00:02:54,140 --> 00:02:55,107
Yes, of course.

5
00:02:57,443 --> 00:02:59,206
- Yes, directly over here.
- All right.

6
00:03:00,113 --> 00:03:00,943
The invitations.

7
00:03:01,047 --> 00:03:04,210
- Eugene Morgan is back in town.
- Hello, Sam.

8
00:03:04,484 --> 00:03:07,317
- Good evening. Eugene Morgan.
- Welcome, sir.

9
00:03:10,890 --> 00:03:11,948
Yes, thanks.

10
00:03:12,625 --> 00:03:13,751
Let's go.

11
00:03:14,761 --> 00:03:18,857
It's Eugene. Eugene Morgan.
He's a childhood friend of mine.

12
00:03:25,104 --> 00:03:28,096
- Remember you very well indeed.
- Nice to meet you.

13
00:03:28,942 --> 00:03:29,909
Isabel.

14
00:03:30,376 --> 00:03:31,843
Remember you very well indeed.

15
00:03:34,214 --> 00:03:35,704
Remember you very well indeed.

16
00:03:36,916 --> 00:03:38,747
- Isabel.
- Eugene!

17
00:03:42,555 --> 00:03:45,058
- Is this your boy?
- Yes. George, this is...

18
00:03:45,058 --> 00:03:46,616
Remember you very well indeed.

19
00:03:48,995 --> 00:03:50,690
George, you never saw me
before in your life, but...

20
00:03:50,830 --> 00:03:53,321
from now on you're going
to be seeing a lot of me. I hope.

21
00:03:53,399 --> 00:03:54,593
I hope so too, Eugene.

22
00:03:55,535 --> 00:03:56,236
Where's Wilbur?

23
00:03:56,236 --> 00:03:58,136
He's off in the game room
with the others.

24
00:03:58,204 --> 00:04:00,900
He never was much for parties.
Remember?

25
00:04:01,040 --> 00:04:03,372
Yes, I remember.
I will come back for a dance.

26
00:04:03,476 --> 00:04:04,773
Please, do.

27
00:04:11,284 --> 00:04:12,410
Eugene Morgan, Major.

28
00:04:12,485 --> 00:04:13,975
- Remember you very well indeed.
- Of course...

29
00:04:14,153 --> 00:04:15,381
of course!

30
00:04:15,622 --> 00:04:17,249
I heard you'd come back to town.

31
00:04:17,757 --> 00:04:19,918
Are you thinking
of settling down here?

32
00:04:19,993 --> 00:04:22,791
- I plan to, Major.
- Hello, Eugene...

33
00:04:28,234 --> 00:04:31,032
It's good to see you!
You look terrific!

34
00:04:31,337 --> 00:04:32,964
Come on,
let's go to the game room!

35
00:05:04,070 --> 00:05:05,537
Remember you very well indeed.

36
00:05:05,672 --> 00:05:07,765
George, you don't remember her either
though of course, you will!

37
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,740
Ms. Morgan is from out of town.

38
00:05:10,543 --> 00:05:14,001
Perhaps you'd like to take her dancing.
You've pretty well done your duty here.

39
00:05:14,647 --> 00:05:15,841
I'd be delighted.

40
00:05:17,784 --> 00:05:18,773
May!

41
00:05:22,922 --> 00:05:23,889
Who is that?

42
00:05:25,258 --> 00:05:27,920
I didn't quite catch his name
when my mother present him to me.

43
00:05:28,461 --> 00:05:29,758
You mean the queer looking guy?

44
00:05:29,896 --> 00:05:31,488
I mean the aristocratic guy.

45
00:05:31,798 --> 00:05:34,767
That's my uncle George.
The honorable George Amberson?

46
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:38,336
I thought everybody knew him.

47
00:05:38,638 --> 00:05:41,801
It looks as if everyone ought to know
him. It seems to run in your family.

48
00:05:41,908 --> 00:05:43,569
I suppose most people do.

49
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,506
Out in this part
of the country specially.

50
00:05:46,479 --> 00:05:48,470
Besides, Uncle George
is in Congress.

51
00:05:48,648 --> 00:05:50,411
The family likes to have
someone there.

52
00:05:51,117 --> 00:05:52,209
Why?

53
00:05:52,752 --> 00:05:55,220
Lt'll make it pleasant when the rest
of the family wants to go traveling...

54
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:56,686
or things like that.

55
00:05:57,190 --> 00:06:00,353
I myself expect to do a great deal
of traveling when I leave college.

56
00:06:14,507 --> 00:06:17,635
I suppose he will be too,
when this time goes.

57
00:06:21,881 --> 00:06:25,146
Oh, is this Lucy Morgan?

58
00:06:25,284 --> 00:06:27,013
Ms. Morgan, Ms. Sheffield...

59
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:28,951
this is my aunt,
Ms. Fanny Minafer.

60
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:31,620
And this is Ms. Johnson,
my friend Charlie's mother.

61
00:06:31,691 --> 00:06:35,388
You must favor your mother, dear.
I never knew her.

62
00:06:40,533 --> 00:06:41,363
- Hello, Lucy.
- Hello, Lucy.

63
00:06:41,467 --> 00:06:42,695
- Hello.
- Hello, Lucy.

64
00:06:42,802 --> 00:06:43,632
- Hello.
- Hello, Lucy.

65
00:06:43,736 --> 00:06:46,005
Lucy, can I have the next dance,
please?

66
00:06:46,005 --> 00:06:46,733
Yes, yes.

67
00:06:46,806 --> 00:06:48,296
- It's Geoffrey.
- Geoffrey.

68
00:06:48,574 --> 00:06:51,168
Lucy, my name is Edward,
and I would love to dance with you.

69
00:06:51,310 --> 00:06:53,073
And how about one
for Fred Kinney?

70
00:06:53,179 --> 00:06:54,669
- Ok. Hi, Fred.
- Hi.

71
00:06:54,814 --> 00:06:57,942
Give me the next one.
And the one after that.

72
00:06:58,084 --> 00:07:00,211
And give me every third
for the rest of the evening.

73
00:07:00,553 --> 00:07:01,781
Are you asking?

74
00:07:02,422 --> 00:07:03,946
What do you mean "asking"?

75
00:07:04,157 --> 00:07:06,318
Well, it sounded to me
as if you were just telling me...

76
00:07:06,392 --> 00:07:08,257
to give you all those dances.

77
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,555
Well, I want them.

78
00:07:09,695 --> 00:07:12,664
What about all those other girls
that is your duty to dance with?

79
00:07:12,965 --> 00:07:13,693
They will have to go without.

80
00:07:15,768 --> 00:07:16,757
Look here...

81
00:07:16,836 --> 00:07:19,134
I want to know:
Are you going to give me those?

82
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,233
Good Gracious.

83
00:07:22,375 --> 00:07:23,433
Yes.

84
00:07:26,446 --> 00:07:28,073
- My name is William.
- William.

85
00:07:28,214 --> 00:07:29,408
- Alfred.
- Alfred.

86
00:07:29,515 --> 00:07:30,948
- I would love to dance with you.
- Right.

87
00:07:31,551 --> 00:07:32,540
And...

88
00:07:38,825 --> 00:07:40,884
I can't believe that fellow.
He just sweeps in here...

89
00:07:40,993 --> 00:07:42,517
and takes that girl right away!

90
00:07:49,001 --> 00:07:50,764
Eugene, you're so funny!

91
00:07:51,737 --> 00:07:53,534
How is that for a bit of freshness!

92
00:07:53,739 --> 00:07:54,797
What was?

93
00:07:55,174 --> 00:07:57,608
That queer guy waving at me
like that.

94
00:07:58,611 --> 00:07:59,839
He meant me.

95
00:08:00,213 --> 00:08:02,340
Oh. You seem to know
too many people.

96
00:08:02,548 --> 00:08:04,812
Papa does. You know,
he used to live here in this town...

97
00:08:04,917 --> 00:08:06,248
before I was born.

98
00:08:06,486 --> 00:08:07,578
Where do you live now?

99
00:08:07,720 --> 00:08:08,921
We don't live anywhere.

100
00:08:08,921 --> 00:08:10,980
What do you mean
you don't live anywhere?

101
00:08:11,123 --> 00:08:12,988
Well, we've lived all over.

102
00:08:13,693 --> 00:08:16,787
Why did you keep moving around for?
Is your father a promoter?

103
00:08:16,896 --> 00:08:20,297
- No, he is an inventor.
- What's he invented?

104
00:08:20,833 --> 00:08:24,269
Lately, he's been working
on a kind of horseless carriage.

105
00:08:26,172 --> 00:08:29,198
Look here, who sent you those flowers
you keep making such a fuss over?

106
00:08:29,275 --> 00:08:30,242
What?

107
00:08:30,910 --> 00:08:33,538
- He did.
- Who's he?

108
00:08:34,013 --> 00:08:36,311
- The queer looking guy?
- Him?

109
00:08:37,216 --> 00:08:39,116
I suppose he is some widower.

110
00:08:40,119 --> 00:08:41,609
Yes, he is a widower.

111
00:08:43,256 --> 00:08:46,225
I ought to have told you before.
He is my father.

112
00:08:50,396 --> 00:08:52,626
Well, that's a horse on me.
If I had known he was your father...

113
00:08:52,732 --> 00:08:54,393
of course, I would not
have made fun of him.

114
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:56,259
I am sorry.

115
00:08:56,402 --> 00:08:59,030
- Nobody could make fun of him.
- Why couldn't they?

116
00:08:59,171 --> 00:09:02,072
I wouldn't make him funny,
it'd only make themselves silly.

117
00:09:03,109 --> 00:09:05,600
Well, I am not going
to make myself silly anymore, then.

118
00:09:06,112 --> 00:09:07,909
I don't want to take
chances like that with you.

119
00:09:12,718 --> 00:09:13,742
Thank you.

120
00:09:14,287 --> 00:09:15,686
"Damas y caballeros".

121
00:09:15,788 --> 00:09:19,952
Ladies and gentlemen,
directly from New York and Europe...

122
00:09:20,126 --> 00:09:21,957
the forbidden dance.

123
00:09:37,910 --> 00:09:40,174
Hello young namesake!

124
00:09:40,279 --> 00:09:43,373
Life lingers on the languid
heels of the dancer!

125
00:09:43,549 --> 00:09:45,608
She is around here,
waiting for me somewhere.

126
00:09:47,219 --> 00:09:49,687
See, who is this fellow Morgan,
auntie Fanny was dancing with?

127
00:09:49,789 --> 00:09:51,586
He is a man with
a pretty daughter, Georgie.

128
00:09:51,724 --> 00:09:54,921
It seems you have spent the evening
noticing something of the sort.

129
00:09:55,227 --> 00:09:56,455
Never mind!

130
00:09:57,263 --> 00:09:58,560
What sort of man is he?

131
00:09:58,698 --> 00:10:00,499
Your question is purely
mercenary, I take it.

132
00:10:00,499 --> 00:10:02,001
If you want to know
his true worth...

133
00:10:02,001 --> 00:10:03,798
before proceeding further
with his daughter...

134
00:10:04,270 --> 00:10:07,569
I can not inform you. Thou
I noticed signs of considerable...

135
00:10:07,640 --> 00:10:10,871
prosperity in that becoming dress
of hers.

136
00:10:12,144 --> 00:10:13,543
Oh, dry up.

137
00:10:15,314 --> 00:10:18,977
He seems at home here, by the way
he is dancing with aunt Fanny.

138
00:10:19,118 --> 00:10:21,143
I am afraid
your Aunt Fanny's heart...

139
00:10:21,287 --> 00:10:25,018
was stirred by ancient
recollections, Georgie.

140
00:10:25,558 --> 00:10:27,492
You mean she was silly on him?

141
00:10:27,760 --> 00:10:29,887
She wasn't considered singular,
He was...

142
00:10:30,329 --> 00:10:31,853
he was popular.

143
00:10:31,964 --> 00:10:33,733
Do you take the same
passionate interest...

144
00:10:33,733 --> 00:10:35,758
in the parents of every girl
you dance with?

145
00:10:36,202 --> 00:10:38,864
Oh, go on!
I only wanted to know.

146
00:11:20,246 --> 00:11:21,178
Eugene Morgan!

147
00:11:22,214 --> 00:11:24,478
- Wilbur.
- I heard that you were in town.

148
00:11:25,985 --> 00:11:28,613
Twenty years!
Make some difference in the face...

149
00:11:28,688 --> 00:11:30,417
but more in behavior!

150
00:11:30,856 --> 00:11:32,824
My own behavior began
to be different about that...

151
00:11:33,259 --> 00:11:35,250
long ago,
quite suddenly.

152
00:11:35,428 --> 00:11:36,622
I remember.

153
00:11:36,762 --> 00:11:39,697
Well, life is odd enough
as we look back.

154
00:11:39,799 --> 00:11:42,324
It will probably be odder still
as we look forward.

155
00:11:42,401 --> 00:11:45,996
Tom, I heard you were in the
conservatory dancing like an Indian.

156
00:11:46,138 --> 00:11:50,370
I leave that to my boy Fred.
He is competing with young Georgie...

157
00:11:50,443 --> 00:11:53,901
for the prettiest girl I have seen
here for some time.

158
00:11:54,647 --> 00:11:56,171
Those boys had a row as kids...

159
00:11:56,282 --> 00:11:57,977
and there's still a bitter feud
between them!

160
00:11:58,117 --> 00:11:59,641
And between him and others.

161
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:02,544
Does young George
dislike people generally?

162
00:12:02,688 --> 00:12:04,349
I don't know about "generally".

163
00:12:04,457 --> 00:12:07,483
But there are a lot of people who'd be
glad to express their opinion about him.

164
00:12:07,626 --> 00:12:08,894
What is the matter with him?

165
00:12:08,894 --> 00:12:10,885
Too much "Amberson", I suppose,
for one thing.

166
00:12:11,197 --> 00:12:14,860
And then for another, his mother just
worshiped him from the day he was born.

167
00:12:15,000 --> 00:12:19,437
He acts the high tin God, yet this
intelligent, high-spirited woman...

168
00:12:19,572 --> 00:12:21,199
can't see the truth of it.

169
00:12:22,908 --> 00:12:25,044
What does she see
when she looks at him?

170
00:12:25,044 --> 00:12:25,976
She sees an angel.

171
00:12:26,112 --> 00:12:29,513
If she sees an angel, she's a funnier
woman than I thought she was!

172
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:32,607
Perhaps.
But that's what she sees.

173
00:12:33,152 --> 00:12:37,088
Mothers see the angel in us
because the angel... is there.

174
00:12:37,456 --> 00:12:40,391
What? You mean if a son cuts
somebody's throat...

175
00:12:40,526 --> 00:12:43,927
then the mother can only see that
it is possible for a misguided angel...

176
00:12:43,996 --> 00:12:44,985
to act like a devil.

177
00:12:45,097 --> 00:12:46,655
And she'd be entirely right
about that!

178
00:12:47,533 --> 00:12:49,967
What you are saying
is Isabel is always right!

179
00:12:50,169 --> 00:12:52,137
No, no.

180
00:12:52,772 --> 00:12:55,070
But in her mind,
she always has been!

181
00:12:56,342 --> 00:12:59,800
Some people might think
she was wrong once, you know!

182
00:13:00,312 --> 00:13:02,576
No. No, no.

183
00:13:02,715 --> 00:13:04,239
- My Lord.
- No.

184
00:13:04,383 --> 00:13:06,442
This is like old times
starting all over again.

185
00:13:06,552 --> 00:13:08,713
Old times? Not a bit!
When times are gone...

186
00:13:08,821 --> 00:13:10,550
they are not old, they're dead!

187
00:13:10,923 --> 00:13:13,687
- There aren't any times but new times!
- Here, here!

188
00:13:16,729 --> 00:13:18,856
- So what are you studying in school?
- College.

189
00:13:18,964 --> 00:13:21,762
At the University, yes,
what are you studying there?

190
00:13:22,168 --> 00:13:23,726
Lots of useless guff!

191
00:13:23,803 --> 00:13:26,203
So why don't you study
some useful guff?

192
00:13:26,372 --> 00:13:27,737
What d'ya mean, useful?

193
00:13:27,840 --> 00:13:31,298
Something you would use later,
in your business or profession.

194
00:13:31,944 --> 00:13:34,879
I don't expect to go into any business,
or profession.

195
00:13:35,014 --> 00:13:36,914
- No?
- Certainly not.

196
00:13:37,016 --> 00:13:38,040
Why not?

197
00:13:40,653 --> 00:13:41,642
Take a look at them.

198
00:13:42,154 --> 00:13:44,247
That's a fine career
for a man, isn't it?

199
00:13:44,623 --> 00:13:48,719
Businessmen, lawyers, politicians...

200
00:13:49,962 --> 00:13:53,398
I mean, what do they ever get
out of life? What do they ever know?

201
00:13:53,599 --> 00:13:54,759
Where do they ever get?

202
00:13:55,434 --> 00:13:56,799
What do you want to do?

203
00:13:57,570 --> 00:13:58,901
A yachtsman!

204
00:14:00,906 --> 00:14:03,602
- Come on, come on!
- George!

205
00:14:04,076 --> 00:14:05,236
Come on!

206
00:14:08,347 --> 00:14:11,111
Excuse me!
Excuse me!

207
00:14:11,383 --> 00:14:14,147
Out of the way! Out of the way!

208
00:16:04,763 --> 00:16:06,526
- Thank you.
- Will you come again?

209
00:16:07,700 --> 00:16:08,894
Excuse me.

210
00:16:10,502 --> 00:16:11,992
How lovely your mother is!

211
00:16:12,871 --> 00:16:14,099
I think she is.

212
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:18,103
She's the most graceful of women,
she dances like a girl of 16.

213
00:16:18,310 --> 00:16:20,608
Most girls of 16 are bum dancers!

214
00:16:20,946 --> 00:16:23,278
Anyhow, I wouldn't dance
with one unless I had to!

215
00:16:27,186 --> 00:16:28,517
The snow's fine for sleighing.

216
00:16:29,288 --> 00:16:31,552
I'll be by for you tomorrow
in a cutter a tad after two...

217
00:16:31,690 --> 00:16:34,124
Tomorrow I can't possibly go.

218
00:16:34,760 --> 00:16:36,990
If you don't, I'm going
to sit outside your gate...

219
00:16:37,096 --> 00:16:39,587
and if you try to go out with anybody
else, he's going to have to whip me...

220
00:16:39,665 --> 00:16:40,723
before he gets to you.

221
00:16:41,300 --> 00:16:44,167
- Major, thank you so much.
- Eugene.

222
00:16:44,269 --> 00:16:46,897
Thanks so much. A tremendous party,
a pleasure seeing you looking so well.

223
00:16:47,206 --> 00:16:48,264
Thank you.

224
00:16:49,208 --> 00:16:51,039
Are you ready, Lucy?

225
00:16:55,214 --> 00:16:56,681
- Good night, Ms. Minafer.
- Good night, Lucy.

226
00:16:56,782 --> 00:16:58,272
I hope we see much more of you!

227
00:16:58,650 --> 00:17:00,777
You'd better take
this scarf Lucy dear...

228
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:03,150
- Thank you, Ms. Minafer.
- You're welcome.

229
00:17:03,722 --> 00:17:04,950
Lucy?

230
00:17:06,358 --> 00:17:09,259
- I'm coming out too!
- Fanny, you'll catch cold!

231
00:17:09,361 --> 00:17:12,797
Lf we're going to ride in that thing
tomorrow I want to make sure it's safe!

232
00:17:17,669 --> 00:17:20,638
- Good night, Isabel.
- Good night, Eugene.

233
00:17:33,052 --> 00:17:34,144
Thank you.

234
00:17:35,387 --> 00:17:36,513
Thanks.

235
00:17:43,629 --> 00:17:44,527
Hello!

236
00:17:44,997 --> 00:17:46,055
Pop...

237
00:17:46,532 --> 00:17:49,933
Poppa, do you think George is
terribly arrogant and domineering?

238
00:17:50,502 --> 00:17:53,198
Oh, he's still only a boy!
There's plenty of fine stuff in him.

239
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,398
Can't help but be!
He's Isabel Amberson's son.

240
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,106
You liked her pretty well once
I guess?

241
00:17:58,377 --> 00:17:59,867
Yes! Yeah, I still do.

242
00:18:01,513 --> 00:18:03,708
She's lovely... lovely.

243
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:05,181
I find her...

244
00:18:06,652 --> 00:18:07,846
What?

245
00:18:08,720 --> 00:18:10,244
How did she happen
to marry Mr. Minafer?

246
00:18:10,456 --> 00:18:11,946
Oh, Wilbur's all right!

247
00:18:30,109 --> 00:18:33,245
Lt seems pretty much like squandering,
but when you see that dog out...

248
00:18:33,245 --> 00:18:36,043
walking with Miss Isabel,
it seems worth the money.

249
00:18:36,982 --> 00:18:39,007
I don't know
as I know how to put this...

250
00:18:39,151 --> 00:18:42,211
but she's kind of a delightful
looking young lady.

251
00:18:56,168 --> 00:18:57,260
Eugene!

252
00:18:57,469 --> 00:19:00,097
- Come on over here, Eugene!
- Come on, Eugene!

253
00:19:12,384 --> 00:19:13,817
Hey, give it back!

254
00:19:14,987 --> 00:19:16,750
Eugene! Give it back!

255
00:19:21,894 --> 00:19:23,225
A poem.

256
00:19:23,729 --> 00:19:27,665
I am of old and young,
of the foolish...

257
00:19:27,866 --> 00:19:30,232
as much as the wise...

258
00:19:30,335 --> 00:19:34,965
Regardless of others,
ever regardful of others.

259
00:19:57,462 --> 00:19:58,986
I can't...

260
00:20:25,057 --> 00:20:26,388
Eugene!

261
00:20:29,394 --> 00:20:31,123
The band
is going to sound better now!

262
00:20:31,230 --> 00:20:33,596
My hearing's going to be...

263
00:20:42,641 --> 00:20:44,243
Is Miss Amberson at home?

264
00:20:44,243 --> 00:20:47,076
No, Mr. Morgan,
Miss. Amberson is not at home.

265
00:20:48,680 --> 00:20:49,908
Thank you, Sam.

266
00:20:59,825 --> 00:21:01,122
Dear Isabel...

267
00:21:01,660 --> 00:21:05,426
You seem to care a great deal
about double bass's.

268
00:21:07,399 --> 00:21:09,299
I promise never to break another.

269
00:21:14,806 --> 00:21:18,298
No sir, Miss Amberson's
not at home to you Mr. Morgan.

270
00:21:19,111 --> 00:21:20,874
- Thanks, Sam.
- Mr. Morgan...

271
00:21:21,513 --> 00:21:26,041
this time she really is out,
with Mr. Wilbur Minafer.

272
00:21:26,351 --> 00:21:28,615
Yesterday they were row boating.

273
00:21:32,257 --> 00:21:33,349
Thanks, Sam.

274
00:22:06,325 --> 00:22:08,452
Getting married, getting married!

275
00:22:08,794 --> 00:22:10,887
Isabel!

276
00:22:44,329 --> 00:22:45,796
Good.

277
00:22:45,931 --> 00:22:47,831
Push harder, push harder!

278
00:22:48,266 --> 00:22:51,064
Yes, yes, very good!

279
00:22:51,370 --> 00:22:53,770
Now, that is it.
Good.

280
00:22:54,806 --> 00:22:55,932
Push.

281
00:22:57,642 --> 00:22:58,609
Push!

282
00:22:59,244 --> 00:23:00,575
Very good!

283
00:23:30,008 --> 00:23:32,033
Gentlemen, please!

284
00:23:32,944 --> 00:23:37,278
Mrs. Minafer will not be able
to have any more children.

285
00:23:37,816 --> 00:23:40,546
I'm sorry. Good day!

286
00:23:56,701 --> 00:23:58,532
Giddy up, giddy up!
Move out! Come on!

287
00:23:59,504 --> 00:24:01,802
Get out of my way, get out!

288
00:24:06,011 --> 00:24:09,037
By golly! I guess you think
you own this town!

289
00:24:09,214 --> 00:24:12,706
I will, when I grow up. I guess
my grandpa owns it now, you bet!

290
00:24:12,851 --> 00:24:14,182
I'll pull off your vest!

291
00:24:14,286 --> 00:24:16,811
Don't have to!
Doctor says it ain't healthy.

292
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,115
But I'll tell you what I'll do!

293
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:21,089
I'll pull down my vest
if you'll wipe off your chin.

294
00:24:21,426 --> 00:24:26,329
Well! I'd like to know if young
George Minafer isn't spoiled enough...

295
00:24:26,431 --> 00:24:29,093
for a whole cartload of children.

296
00:24:32,938 --> 00:24:34,405
Look, it's the girlie curls!

297
00:24:34,573 --> 00:24:35,841
Get out of my way!

298
00:24:35,841 --> 00:24:38,639
Say bub! Why d'ya steal
your mother's old sash?

299
00:24:38,710 --> 00:24:40,337
Your sister stole it for me.

300
00:24:40,412 --> 00:24:42,880
Stole it off her own clothesline
and gave it to me.

301
00:24:42,981 --> 00:24:44,676
I haven't got any sister!

302
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,546
I know you haven't at home.
I mean the one that's in jail.

303
00:24:47,652 --> 00:24:50,177
I dare you to get out of that cart!

304
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,214
I'll get him, don't worry!

305
00:24:54,759 --> 00:24:56,428
- I dare you to come over here!
- Yeah?

306
00:24:56,428 --> 00:24:58,487
I dare you, half way her

307
00:24:58,663 --> 00:25:00,130
Here I come!

308
00:25:04,469 --> 00:25:05,936
Take that, Fred Kinney.

309
00:25:10,742 --> 00:25:12,403
Boy! Boy!

310
00:25:12,511 --> 00:25:13,705
Here boy!

311
00:25:13,812 --> 00:25:15,837
Now that will be enough of that!

312
00:25:15,914 --> 00:25:16,778
You will...

313
00:25:17,415 --> 00:25:19,713
You stop that! You...
I guess you don't know who I am?

314
00:25:19,784 --> 00:25:21,274
Yes, I do know...

315
00:25:21,353 --> 00:25:23,218
and you're a disgrace
to your mother!

316
00:25:23,321 --> 00:25:24,913
You shut up about my mother!

317
00:25:24,990 --> 00:25:27,925
She ought to be ashamed.
A woman who'll let a bad boy like you...

318
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:30,790
Pull down your vest
you old billy goat you!

319
00:25:30,929 --> 00:25:32,726
Pull down your vest,
wipe off your chin...

320
00:25:32,831 --> 00:25:34,230
and go to hell!

321
00:25:36,134 --> 00:25:37,658
"Pull down your vest...

322
00:25:38,103 --> 00:25:41,129
wipe off your chin,
and go to hell".

323
00:25:41,640 --> 00:25:44,837
- Did you say what he said you did, dear?
- Which one?

324
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,935
- Did you tell him to go to...
- Listen here, mom...

325
00:25:47,045 --> 00:25:49,707
Grandpa wouldn't wipe his shoe
on that old storyteller, would he?

326
00:25:49,781 --> 00:25:51,180
- Georgie, don't!
- I mean...

327
00:25:51,316 --> 00:25:54,217
none of the Ambersons would have
anything to do with him, would they?

328
00:25:54,619 --> 00:25:55,984
Come here.

329
00:25:56,354 --> 00:25:57,821
That's not
what we're talking about!

330
00:25:57,956 --> 00:25:59,253
I bet if he wanted to see
any of us...

331
00:25:59,357 --> 00:26:01,188
he'd have to go round
to the side door.

332
00:26:01,293 --> 00:26:02,453
George...

333
00:26:03,194 --> 00:26:04,957
- Please, Major.
- No!

334
00:26:05,096 --> 00:26:06,120
Yes, he would, Mom!

335
00:26:06,197 --> 00:26:08,927
That kind of people, I don't see why
we can't say anything we want to them.

336
00:26:09,034 --> 00:26:11,059
No Georgie, those were terrible
words that you used!

337
00:26:11,136 --> 00:26:13,866
- But he's just riffraff!
- You mustn't say so!

338
00:26:14,439 --> 00:26:17,067
Just promise me
you'll never say bad words!

339
00:26:17,175 --> 00:26:19,040
- I promise.
- All right.

340
00:26:20,145 --> 00:26:21,112
Go!

341
00:26:22,247 --> 00:26:24,215
Unless I get mad at somebody...

342
00:26:33,925 --> 00:26:35,950
- Careful!
- Slow down!

343
00:26:38,663 --> 00:26:39,721
Slow down, boy!

344
00:26:41,066 --> 00:26:43,261
- Got any sense?
- Watch it now!

345
00:26:43,368 --> 00:26:46,394
See here, bub!
Does your mother know you're out!

346
00:26:47,639 --> 00:26:49,539
Pull down your pants,
you would be dude!

347
00:26:49,641 --> 00:26:53,975
Raining in dear old money!
Get off the earth!

348
00:27:28,046 --> 00:27:29,707
Welcome, friends of the Ace!

349
00:27:30,015 --> 00:27:32,040
Welcome, friends of the Ace!

350
00:27:32,817 --> 00:27:35,843
Take your seat in the secret square.
We will now proceed to...

351
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,581
Look here, Charlie Johnson!

352
00:27:37,756 --> 00:27:39,383
What's Fred Kinney doing
in the President's chair?

353
00:27:39,624 --> 00:27:43,526
Didn't you all agree I was
to be President just the same...

354
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,686
even if I was away at school?

355
00:27:46,498 --> 00:27:48,523
All friends of the Ace
will take their seats!

356
00:27:48,700 --> 00:27:51,760
I'm president of the F O T A
now, George Minafer.

357
00:27:52,437 --> 00:27:54,962
- This meeting will now proceed to...
- No, it won't.

358
00:27:55,073 --> 00:27:58,065
You put down that gavel!
Lt belongs to my grandfather!

359
00:27:58,143 --> 00:28:01,340
- I was legally elected here!
- All right...

360
00:28:01,479 --> 00:28:04,846
you're President:
Now we'll hold another election!

361
00:28:04,949 --> 00:28:05,916
We will not!

362
00:28:06,084 --> 00:28:08,484
We'll have our regular meeting,
and then we'll play Yuker.

363
00:28:08,687 --> 00:28:10,621
And Nick in the corner.
That's what we're here for!

364
00:28:10,755 --> 00:28:14,156
Who's the founder of the F O T A,
if you please?

365
00:28:14,325 --> 00:28:16,759
Who got the Janitor to let us have
most of this furniture?

366
00:28:16,961 --> 00:28:18,986
Do you suppose you could
keep this clubroom a minute...

367
00:28:19,197 --> 00:28:22,997
if I told my grandpa I didn't want it
for a Literary Club any more?

368
00:28:23,301 --> 00:28:26,634
I'd like to say a word about how
the new members have been acting too.

369
00:28:27,038 --> 00:28:29,734
That's what you want?
You can have it!

370
00:28:30,542 --> 00:28:33,409
All in favor of having
a new election say "l"

371
00:28:33,578 --> 00:28:34,670
"l".

372
00:28:34,813 --> 00:28:37,714
All in favor of me being President
instead of... Fred Kinney...

373
00:28:37,782 --> 00:28:39,409
- say "l".
- "L".

374
00:28:40,018 --> 00:28:41,542
The "Is" have it.

375
00:28:44,823 --> 00:28:46,120
I resign!

376
00:28:58,336 --> 00:29:00,634
Old redhead Fred will be back
around next week.

377
00:29:00,739 --> 00:29:03,572
He'll be around bootlicking to get us
to take him back in again!

378
00:29:06,678 --> 00:29:09,374
Now I don't suppose there's any more
business before the meeting?

379
00:29:09,748 --> 00:29:12,376
Anybody who's game
for a little quarter limit poker...

380
00:29:12,484 --> 00:29:13,815
or any limit, as they say...

381
00:29:13,918 --> 00:29:16,887
I'd like to have them sit
at the President's card table.

382
00:29:19,758 --> 00:29:20,725
Your face looks like...

383
00:29:21,626 --> 00:29:23,753
it looks like a snowflake
on a lump of coal.

384
00:29:23,862 --> 00:29:25,454
Perhaps you'd better
look at the reins!

385
00:29:25,563 --> 00:29:28,293
'Cos there's too much pink
in your cheeks for a snow-flake.

386
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:30,492
We're going pretty fast,
Mr. Minafer.

387
00:29:31,002 --> 00:29:32,560
Well, you see,
I'm only here for two weeks...

388
00:29:32,670 --> 00:29:34,035
I mean the sleigh!

389
00:29:34,339 --> 00:29:36,569
I suppose your father thinks
he can build a horseless carriage...

390
00:29:36,674 --> 00:29:37,971
that can go that fast!

391
00:29:38,109 --> 00:29:40,236
Lt can go that fast already
sometimes.

392
00:29:41,446 --> 00:29:45,542
All of this land, 200 acres of it,
my grandfather developed.

393
00:29:45,884 --> 00:29:50,014
He built the streets, set up statues
and fountains.

394
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,584
It's called the Amberson Addition.

395
00:29:57,362 --> 00:29:59,660
And that there is Amberson Boulevard.

396
00:30:00,565 --> 00:30:02,260
It must be from the soot.

397
00:30:03,334 --> 00:30:06,201
Somebody ought to see
that these statues are kept clean.

398
00:30:06,738 --> 00:30:08,865
There are so many houses
around here!

399
00:30:09,107 --> 00:30:13,567
My grandfather sold most of the lots,
there aren't any vacant ones left.

400
00:30:13,812 --> 00:30:15,871
And there used to be heaps
when I was a boy.

401
00:30:17,649 --> 00:30:22,382
Many people built houses, and then the
price of the land kept getting higher...

402
00:30:22,487 --> 00:30:25,513
and, people sold part of their yards and
the people who bought 'em built houses.

403
00:30:26,157 --> 00:30:27,419
The way it used to be...

404
00:30:27,859 --> 00:30:32,091
it was like a gentleman's country state.
That's the way my grandpa will keep it.

405
00:30:32,764 --> 00:30:34,732
These people do anything
they want to!

406
00:30:35,400 --> 00:30:38,767
But how can you stop them, if you sold
them the land, it's theirs, isn't it?

407
00:30:38,903 --> 00:30:41,701
He ought to have all the trades-people
boycott them!

408
00:30:41,906 --> 00:30:45,706
All he'd have to do is say they wouldn't
get any more orders from the family.

409
00:30:45,844 --> 00:30:47,277
The family?

410
00:30:47,912 --> 00:30:49,277
The Ambersons.

411
00:30:49,814 --> 00:30:50,508
I see.

412
00:30:54,519 --> 00:30:56,111
What are you laughing at now?

413
00:30:56,621 --> 00:30:59,590
You always seem to have some little
secret of your own to get happy over!

414
00:30:59,724 --> 00:31:03,319
Always? What a big word
when we only met last night!

415
00:31:04,195 --> 00:31:08,188
That's another case of it! One of
the reasons I don't like you... much...

416
00:31:08,266 --> 00:31:11,861
is that you've got this way of seeming
quietly superior to everybody else.

417
00:31:12,070 --> 00:31:13,264
I have?

418
00:31:14,239 --> 00:31:17,231
Oh, you think you keep it,
sort of confidential to yourself!

419
00:31:17,709 --> 00:31:19,301
I don't believe
in that kind of thing.

420
00:31:19,878 --> 00:31:21,846
- You don't?
- No.

421
00:31:22,614 --> 00:31:24,411
I believe the world is like this...

422
00:31:24,949 --> 00:31:27,850
There are a few people where their birth
and position puts them at the top...

423
00:31:27,952 --> 00:31:30,682
and they are to treat each other
entirely as equals.

424
00:31:32,523 --> 00:31:34,753
I wouldn't speak like this
with everybody.

425
00:31:36,094 --> 00:31:39,689
You mean, you are confiding
your deepest creed to me?

426
00:31:40,498 --> 00:31:41,863
Go on, make fun of it then!

427
00:31:42,066 --> 00:31:44,398
Well, if you don't like my seeming
quietly superior...

428
00:31:44,502 --> 00:31:46,800
from now on
I'll be noisily superior.

429
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:48,565
We aim to please.

430
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:52,074
I had a notion before I came to get you
today that we were going to quarrel.

431
00:31:52,210 --> 00:31:53,768
No, we won't!

432
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:55,812
Lt takes two!

433
00:31:58,216 --> 00:31:59,080
Go on!

434
00:32:01,886 --> 00:32:05,117
When we get this far out, we can see
the smoke hanging over the town.

435
00:32:06,724 --> 00:32:09,488
Poppa says it used to be nicer here
when he lived here.

436
00:32:10,662 --> 00:32:13,031
From the way he talks, you'd think
that life here then was just...

437
00:32:13,031 --> 00:32:15,864
one long mid-summer serenade.

438
00:32:15,967 --> 00:32:18,765
There always seemed
to be gold dust in the air!

439
00:32:20,471 --> 00:32:24,532
I think the gold dust he thinks was here
was just being young that he remembers!

440
00:32:25,810 --> 00:32:28,108
Still, it is pretty pleasant
to be young, isn't it!

441
00:32:29,080 --> 00:32:33,176
I wonder if we really do enjoy it
as much as when we look back and...

442
00:32:34,852 --> 00:32:36,513
You're a funny girl.

443
00:32:36,688 --> 00:32:39,782
But your voice sounds pretty nice when
you think and talk along like that.

444
00:32:43,394 --> 00:32:45,658
Hey! Look at that
old sewing machine!

445
00:32:45,863 --> 00:32:47,626
Hey, that's father's car!

446
00:32:47,799 --> 00:32:50,768
And there's your mother,
Miss Minafer, and Mr. Amberson!

447
00:32:53,871 --> 00:32:55,702
Go on! Get on!
Get a horse, get a horse!

448
00:32:55,807 --> 00:32:57,536
Look out!
There's a ditch on the right!

449
00:33:07,251 --> 00:33:08,240
Georgie!

450
00:33:13,691 --> 00:33:14,715
Lucy!

451
00:33:15,326 --> 00:33:16,315
Lucy!

452
00:33:20,999 --> 00:33:22,023
They're all right!

453
00:33:23,601 --> 00:33:26,001
The snow's like a feather bed. There's
nothing the matter with them at all!

454
00:33:26,104 --> 00:33:27,196
George!

455
00:33:27,305 --> 00:33:29,330
- Lucy!
- Georgie!

456
00:33:29,507 --> 00:33:31,202
Georgie! Lucy!

457
00:33:31,676 --> 00:33:33,234
Lucy, dear, are you all right?

458
00:33:33,378 --> 00:33:36,779
- Don't make a fuss Mother!
- Let me see you! When you fell like...

459
00:33:37,849 --> 00:33:40,181
- Let me get the snow off you!
- No! Leave me alone, Mother!

460
00:33:40,284 --> 00:33:42,115
All right, you mustn't catch cold!

461
00:33:42,253 --> 00:33:42,719
Mother...

462
00:33:42,820 --> 00:33:46,119
- I was worried you had broken your neck!
- Stop it. Stop it!

463
00:33:46,424 --> 00:33:47,652
That darn horse!

464
00:33:47,759 --> 00:33:51,354
I wouldn't bother about the horse!
He'll be home a long time before we are!

465
00:33:51,496 --> 00:33:55,296
All we've got to depend on is Eugene's
broken down chafing dish yonder.

466
00:33:55,400 --> 00:33:58,528
Here we go!
All aboard!

467
00:33:59,037 --> 00:34:00,638
- Stop doing this...
- Come on, Mom, get in...

468
00:34:00,638 --> 00:34:03,004
- You will catch a cold!
- Just get in the car!

469
00:34:07,111 --> 00:34:11,571
I walk along with a pot of gold
And an independent wealth

470
00:34:11,649 --> 00:34:15,881
And you can hear the girls declare
He must be a millionaire

471
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:19,687
He was very sad
And he wished to die

472
00:34:19,791 --> 00:34:21,759
And to see in a blink of an eye

473
00:34:21,859 --> 00:34:26,228
The man who wrote the card

474
00:34:26,330 --> 00:34:30,664
He was very sad
And he wished to die

475
00:34:30,768 --> 00:34:33,168
And to see in a blink of an eye

476
00:34:33,304 --> 00:34:37,638
The man who wrote the card

477
00:34:58,262 --> 00:34:59,524
Look here...

478
00:34:59,630 --> 00:35:02,997
How about this man Morgan
and his old sewing machine?

479
00:35:03,734 --> 00:35:06,202
Doesn't he want to get grandfather
to put some money into it?

480
00:35:06,637 --> 00:35:08,070
Isn't that what he's up to?

481
00:35:09,240 --> 00:35:12,004
I bet he borrows money
from Uncle George!

482
00:35:12,477 --> 00:35:14,411
He strikes me
as that sort of a man!

483
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,681
He was a fairly wild young
fellow 20 years ago.

484
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:23,584
He was a lot like you, Georgie.
He spent too much money...

485
00:35:24,589 --> 00:35:28,491
only he didn't have a mom, to get money
out of her grandfather to help him...

486
00:35:28,593 --> 00:35:30,527
so he was usually in debt.

487
00:35:31,429 --> 00:35:34,921
But, I believe he's done fairly well
of late years...

488
00:35:35,433 --> 00:35:39,028
so I doubt he needs anybody's money
to back his horseless carriage.

489
00:35:39,137 --> 00:35:40,866
What's he got her here for then?

490
00:35:41,239 --> 00:35:45,642
People who own elephants don't take
their elephants when they go visiting.

491
00:35:48,279 --> 00:35:51,874
- What has he got it here for?
- I am sure, I don't know.

492
00:35:53,217 --> 00:35:54,809
Why don't you ask him?

493
00:36:04,662 --> 00:36:09,565
While strolling through
The park one day

494
00:36:10,701 --> 00:36:15,866
In the merry month of May

495
00:36:16,407 --> 00:36:23,245
I was taken by surprise
By a pair of roguish eyes

496
00:36:23,347 --> 00:36:28,375
In a moment my poor heart
Was stolen away...

497
00:36:28,886 --> 00:36:32,156
They seem to be getting along
a lot better than they did at first...

498
00:36:32,156 --> 00:36:33,214
those two children.

499
00:36:33,524 --> 00:36:37,961
They seemed to always be having
little quarrels of some sort at first.

500
00:36:38,362 --> 00:36:41,695
At least Georgie did, always being
cross with her over nothing.

501
00:36:41,766 --> 00:36:45,759
Cross with her? My Georgie? Why I
have never seen a more angelically...

502
00:36:45,836 --> 00:36:47,701
amiable disposition in my life!

503
00:36:47,772 --> 00:36:50,434
That's all the side of him
you happen to see!

504
00:36:50,541 --> 00:36:54,272
I immediately raised my hat

505
00:36:55,279 --> 00:37:00,342
And finally she remarked

506
00:37:00,585 --> 00:37:06,820
I never shall forget
That lovely afternoon

507
00:37:06,891 --> 00:37:11,294
I met her at the fountain
In the park

508
00:37:22,206 --> 00:37:25,539
- Would you join me in a drink, Eugene?
- Oh, no, thank you, Major.

509
00:37:25,610 --> 00:37:29,341
Oh, that's right! You don't! Not since
a certain run-in with a double bass!

510
00:37:30,848 --> 00:37:33,874
Well, hardly anybody
drinks nowadays...

511
00:37:36,387 --> 00:37:37,684
Almost.

512
00:37:38,656 --> 00:37:40,590
- Perhaps it's just as well...
- Thank you!

513
00:37:40,725 --> 00:37:42,716
Things used to be livelier.

514
00:37:43,861 --> 00:37:45,260
The fact is...

515
00:37:45,830 --> 00:37:48,264
if you hadn't broken
that double bass...

516
00:37:48,666 --> 00:37:50,691
Isabel would never
have taken Wilbur.

517
00:37:51,035 --> 00:37:53,435
That may be the only
reason Wilbur got her!

518
00:37:58,476 --> 00:38:01,912
By Jove! I think she's blushing!

519
00:38:02,480 --> 00:38:04,539
Who wouldn't?

520
00:38:05,082 --> 00:38:09,018
Well, the important thing is,
that Wilbur did get her.

521
00:38:09,120 --> 00:38:12,521
And he not only got her,
he kept her!

522
00:38:13,958 --> 00:38:17,416
There's another important thing!
Well, that is for me!

523
00:38:18,029 --> 00:38:19,897
Lt's the only thing that makes me
forgive that double bass...

524
00:38:19,897 --> 00:38:20,886
for getting in my way.

525
00:38:20,998 --> 00:38:21,987
What is it?

526
00:38:23,467 --> 00:38:24,593
Lucy.

527
00:38:28,673 --> 00:38:30,163
To Lucy!

528
00:38:37,615 --> 00:38:39,480
For heaven's sake!
What's the matter?

529
00:38:39,583 --> 00:38:41,483
You're going away.

530
00:38:41,786 --> 00:38:44,050
Well, I'll be back,
don't you suppose?

531
00:38:44,121 --> 00:38:47,056
I never could bear to see you go,
that's most of it.

532
00:38:48,059 --> 00:38:50,050
I'm a bit worried about
your father as well.

533
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:52,155
Why?

534
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:55,163
Lt seems to me that he looks badly.
Everybody says so!

535
00:38:55,266 --> 00:38:56,790
Nonsense!

536
00:38:57,101 --> 00:39:00,229
He is not much different from the way
he's looked all his life. I can tell!

537
00:39:00,304 --> 00:39:03,933
He's been worried about his investments,
and I that worry affected his health.

538
00:39:04,108 --> 00:39:05,439
What investments?

539
00:39:06,143 --> 00:39:09,078
He hasn't gone into Mr. Morgan's
automobile concern, has he?

540
00:39:10,681 --> 00:39:11,482
About three years ago...

541
00:39:11,482 --> 00:39:14,315
he and your Uncle George put almost
everything they could get together...

542
00:39:14,418 --> 00:39:18,377
into some stocks of some rolling mills.
And those mills haven't been doing well.

543
00:39:19,423 --> 00:39:22,859
What of that?
You and I will look after him.

544
00:39:23,361 --> 00:39:25,795
We'll build him a little stone bank
out the back...

545
00:39:25,896 --> 00:39:28,199
and every morning
he can put pennies in it...

546
00:39:28,199 --> 00:39:30,497
and we'll keep him
as happy as he's ever been!

547
00:40:14,912 --> 00:40:17,676
I look out on the campus
from my many paned window...

548
00:40:18,215 --> 00:40:21,343
and things are different with me from
the way they were back in freshman year.

549
00:40:22,520 --> 00:40:25,648
I can see now how boyish I was
in many ways back then.

550
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,052
I believe what has changed me as much
as anything was my visit home...

551
00:40:30,161 --> 00:40:31,219
and meeting you.

552
00:40:32,496 --> 00:40:34,930
And so I sit here
with my faithful briar...

553
00:40:35,032 --> 00:40:37,125
and dream all dreams
over as it were.

554
00:40:37,802 --> 00:40:40,396
Dreaming of the waltzes
we waltzed together...

555
00:40:40,571 --> 00:40:42,971
and of the last night
before we parted.

556
00:40:43,541 --> 00:40:45,907
And the good news you were going
to give to me there.

557
00:40:46,544 --> 00:40:49,069
And that I would find my friend
waiting for me...

558
00:40:49,313 --> 00:40:51,577
when I got home next summer.

559
00:41:24,215 --> 00:41:26,046
That telegram came this morning!

560
00:41:46,570 --> 00:41:48,333
Not bad news?

561
00:41:49,373 --> 00:41:50,340
My father!

562
00:41:50,574 --> 00:41:52,371
As you see,
I've got to go home!

563
00:44:09,947 --> 00:44:12,609
Yonder is where I room
when I was here.

564
00:44:13,617 --> 00:44:15,881
I don't know whether George
would allow my admirers...

565
00:44:16,020 --> 00:44:18,454
place a tablet
to mark the spot, or not.

566
00:44:19,423 --> 00:44:22,483
He thinks he owns all of
these buildings now, you know!

567
00:44:22,626 --> 00:44:24,787
Didn't you!
When you were here?

568
00:44:26,263 --> 00:44:27,696
Like Uncle, like nephew!

569
00:44:29,066 --> 00:44:31,728
I wonder if I was like that?

570
00:44:33,704 --> 00:44:35,535
Oh, look at the swell!

571
00:44:37,307 --> 00:44:40,003
You don't suppose every Amberson
has to go through it, do you?

572
00:44:40,344 --> 00:44:43,973
At least half of it is the combination
of youth and good looks and college.

573
00:44:45,115 --> 00:44:47,879
And even the noblest Ambersons
get over their nobility...

574
00:44:48,085 --> 00:44:49,882
and come to be people in time.

575
00:44:53,223 --> 00:44:55,025
It takes more than time,
though.

576
00:44:55,025 --> 00:44:57,118
You should say it did take
more than time!

577
00:44:57,227 --> 00:44:58,524
Lt's charming, isn't it?

578
00:44:58,629 --> 00:45:01,291
They're so eager and confident,
all these boys.

579
00:45:01,999 --> 00:45:03,466
It's touching.

580
00:45:04,802 --> 00:45:07,327
Of course, youth doesn't know
that it's touching!

581
00:45:07,471 --> 00:45:12,374
Do you know what I think whenever I see
all these smooth, triumphal young faces?

582
00:45:12,509 --> 00:45:16,275
I always think: "Oh, how you're
going to catch it!"

583
00:45:16,513 --> 00:45:18,310
Oh, George!

584
00:45:18,482 --> 00:45:20,677
Yes, life is most ingenious...

585
00:45:20,784 --> 00:45:24,652
It has a special walloping
for every mother's son of them!

586
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:28,816
Well... maybe some of the mothers
can take the walloping for them!

587
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,660
Not any more than she can take
on her own face the lines...

588
00:45:31,762 --> 00:45:33,992
that are bound to come
on her sons.

589
00:45:34,131 --> 00:45:38,227
Well, maybe times will change
and nobody will have to wear lines!

590
00:45:38,702 --> 00:45:42,502
Times have changed like that
for only one person that I know.

591
00:45:44,842 --> 00:45:47,538
The serenest brow is the one
that believes the most.

592
00:45:48,512 --> 00:45:49,501
In what?

593
00:45:50,914 --> 00:45:52,404
In everything.

594
00:45:53,550 --> 00:45:54,608
I believe.

595
00:45:55,219 --> 00:45:56,880
I believe I do.

596
00:45:59,223 --> 00:46:01,748
Isabel,
you're a foolish person!

597
00:46:01,925 --> 00:46:04,985
There are times when you look
exactly like 14 years old.

598
00:46:05,229 --> 00:46:06,560
Gracious!

599
00:46:06,930 --> 00:46:09,262
What'll your crowd be
doing after graduation?

600
00:46:09,433 --> 00:46:12,664
Don't you think that being things
is rather better than doing things?

601
00:46:12,903 --> 00:46:14,131
Rather better?

602
00:46:15,773 --> 00:46:19,038
What are these things that are
so superior and beautiful to be?

603
00:46:19,710 --> 00:46:21,109
Family and all that.

604
00:46:21,745 --> 00:46:23,736
Being a gentleman, I suppose.

605
00:46:24,114 --> 00:46:25,581
Where have the children got to?

606
00:46:25,749 --> 00:46:29,515
Yes, where is the exact proprietor
of the universe?

607
00:46:47,671 --> 00:46:50,435
Well, it's never becoming
for your mother to look pale.

608
00:46:52,142 --> 00:46:54,110
- What did you say, Aunt Fanny?
- Nothing.

609
00:46:54,611 --> 00:46:58,206
I suppose your mother's
been pretty gay, going out a lot.

610
00:46:58,882 --> 00:47:00,213
How could she?

611
00:47:00,984 --> 00:47:04,044
I mean, in mourning all she could do
was just sit around and look on.

612
00:47:04,254 --> 00:47:06,415
That's all Lucy Morgan could do
either for the matter of that.

613
00:47:06,523 --> 00:47:09,720
I suppose so.
How did Lucy get home?

614
00:47:11,028 --> 00:47:13,053
Well, she came
on the train with us, of course.

615
00:47:13,330 --> 00:47:16,356
I didn't mean that!
I meant from the station!

616
00:47:17,734 --> 00:47:19,725
She drove home
with her father of course.

617
00:47:19,803 --> 00:47:21,600
Oh, I see, so...

618
00:47:22,005 --> 00:47:24,439
Eugene came to the station
to meet you?

619
00:47:25,442 --> 00:47:27,137
To meet us? How could he?

620
00:47:27,311 --> 00:47:31,475
I don't know what you mean. I haven't
seen him while your mother's been away.

621
00:47:31,615 --> 00:47:33,549
Naturally.
He's been East himself.

622
00:47:33,784 --> 00:47:35,376
Did you see him?

623
00:47:35,786 --> 00:47:38,448
Well, naturally, since he made
the trip home with us.

624
00:47:39,089 --> 00:47:40,351
He did?

625
00:47:40,924 --> 00:47:42,687
He's been with you
the whole time?

626
00:47:43,560 --> 00:47:47,394
No. Only on the train
and the three days before we left.

627
00:47:48,966 --> 00:47:50,866
Uncle George got him to come.

628
00:47:53,303 --> 00:47:55,100
You're a fine housekeeper.

629
00:47:55,305 --> 00:47:58,138
You know how to make things look
dainty as well as taste the right way.

630
00:47:58,375 --> 00:48:01,469
- I shouldn't be a bit surprised if...
- It's real odd...

631
00:48:02,613 --> 00:48:03,511
What is odd?

632
00:48:04,348 --> 00:48:08,580
Your mother not mentioning that
Mr. Morgan had been with you.

633
00:48:09,553 --> 00:48:11,384
Didn't think of it, I suppose.

634
00:48:16,593 --> 00:48:18,254
I'll tell you something
in confidence...

635
00:48:18,996 --> 00:48:20,156
What?

636
00:48:20,564 --> 00:48:24,398
Lt struck me that Mr. Morgan was looking
pretty absent-minded most of the time...

637
00:48:25,102 --> 00:48:27,297
I shouldn't be surprised if
all the young fellow was waiting for...

638
00:48:27,437 --> 00:48:30,634
was to know that he had
an assured income before he proposed.

639
00:48:31,408 --> 00:48:33,342
What young fellow?

640
00:48:33,443 --> 00:48:34,933
This young fellow Morgan.

641
00:48:36,313 --> 00:48:40,716
I shouldn't be a bit surprised to have
him to request an interview with me...

642
00:48:40,851 --> 00:48:43,718
and ask my permission
to pay his addresses to you.

643
00:48:49,493 --> 00:48:51,791
Good heavens!
I was only teasing!

644
00:48:51,962 --> 00:48:53,554
Let me alone!

645
00:48:54,364 --> 00:48:56,264
Please, Aunt Fanny!
Please!

646
00:48:56,400 --> 00:48:58,561
I said: Let me alone!

647
00:49:00,771 --> 00:49:02,068
I didn't mean it!

648
00:49:28,966 --> 00:49:30,490
How can you eat?

649
00:49:37,708 --> 00:49:41,940
In the name of God! What does
grandfather mean by doing such things!

650
00:49:42,412 --> 00:49:46,280
My private opinion is: He desires
to increase his income...

651
00:49:46,416 --> 00:49:48,680
by building these houses to rent.

652
00:49:48,785 --> 00:49:51,276
In the name of God! Couldn't he find any
other way of increasing his income...

653
00:49:51,388 --> 00:49:53,720
other than building
them in the front yard?

654
00:49:53,824 --> 00:49:57,055
In the name of God...
it would appear he couldn't!

655
00:49:57,361 --> 00:50:00,660
Lt's beastly!
Lt's a damned degradation!

656
00:50:00,764 --> 00:50:02,322
Lt's a crime!

657
00:50:07,571 --> 00:50:10,472
Your mother said not to tell you
until we got home...

658
00:50:10,607 --> 00:50:12,700
so as not to spoil commencement.

659
00:50:13,910 --> 00:50:16,777
- She rather feared you'd be upset.
- Upset?

660
00:50:16,847 --> 00:50:20,442
- I should think so!
- Your mother knows you rather well.

661
00:50:20,817 --> 00:50:22,978
And your mother was right!

662
00:50:23,520 --> 00:50:24,612
She is right!

663
00:50:35,866 --> 00:50:37,493
Oh, be careful!

664
00:50:37,601 --> 00:50:40,627
Heavens, oh, my!

665
00:50:41,671 --> 00:50:43,263
My, it's noisy!

666
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,641
All this noise seems
to be good for you!

667
00:50:48,545 --> 00:50:51,673
Perhaps you ought to tour a factory
every time you get the blues!

668
00:50:51,948 --> 00:50:54,746
She doesn't get the blues, George!

669
00:50:54,885 --> 00:50:58,446
I've never seen a person with
a more even disposition in my life!

670
00:50:58,555 --> 00:51:00,420
I wish I could be like that!

671
00:51:01,825 --> 00:51:03,156
Eugene!

672
00:51:04,828 --> 00:51:06,318
Eugene!

673
00:51:08,231 --> 00:51:11,860
Lt makes us all so happy.
Dear old Eugene!

674
00:51:12,769 --> 00:51:14,999
Fanny, take his hand.

675
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:16,699
There.

676
00:51:17,340 --> 00:51:20,707
Now if George was here, Eugene would
have 3 of his oldest and best friends...

677
00:51:20,811 --> 00:51:22,802
congratulating him all at once.

678
00:51:23,547 --> 00:51:25,310
It's just beautiful, Eugene.

679
00:51:34,958 --> 00:51:37,984
- Did you like it?
- Of course I did.

680
00:51:41,364 --> 00:51:45,494
You know, I used to write verse,
if you remember...

681
00:51:45,669 --> 00:51:46,897
Yes, I remember.

682
00:51:47,037 --> 00:51:50,564
I don't recall that I have written any
for 20 years or so...

683
00:51:51,108 --> 00:51:53,201
but I'm almost thinking
that I could do it again...

684
00:51:53,376 --> 00:51:56,106
just to thank you...

685
00:51:56,246 --> 00:51:58,510
for making a factory visit
such a...

686
00:52:00,383 --> 00:52:02,374
such a kind celebration.

687
00:52:08,391 --> 00:52:10,222
Goodness!
Aren't they sentimental!

688
00:52:11,128 --> 00:52:12,618
People that age always are!

689
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,257
They get sentimental
over anything at all!

690
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:33,344
- I quite enjoyed part of that tour!
- The assembly of the engine?

691
00:52:33,783 --> 00:52:34,807
No.

692
00:52:35,318 --> 00:52:37,843
- You whispering to me!
- Blarney!

693
00:52:43,026 --> 00:52:45,256
- No, don't.
- Don't?

694
00:52:45,896 --> 00:52:49,662
I know when you let us drift like this
it's to give all of your attention...

695
00:52:50,534 --> 00:52:52,468
to proposing to me again.

696
00:52:52,869 --> 00:52:56,305
Lucy.
Dear, what is the matter?

697
00:52:56,773 --> 00:52:58,638
You look as if
you are going to cry!

698
00:52:59,809 --> 00:53:03,176
You always do that whenever I get
to talk to you about marrying me.

699
00:53:04,147 --> 00:53:05,739
Everything is just so...

700
00:53:07,017 --> 00:53:08,211
unsettled.

701
00:53:09,252 --> 00:53:12,744
If you aren't the queerest girl!
What is unsettled?

702
00:53:12,856 --> 00:53:15,848
Well, for one thing,
you haven't settled on anything to do.

703
00:53:16,326 --> 00:53:18,760
At least, if you have, you've never
spoken to me about it.

704
00:53:20,397 --> 00:53:24,333
You really don't mean to have any
regular business or profession at all?

705
00:53:24,601 --> 00:53:26,364
I certainly do not!

706
00:53:29,239 --> 00:53:30,831
I was afraid so.

707
00:53:33,109 --> 00:53:34,440
So that's it, is it?

708
00:53:35,011 --> 00:53:37,070
Lt's your father's idea
that I ought to go into business...

709
00:53:37,180 --> 00:53:39,171
and that you oughtn't to be engaged
to me until I do.

710
00:53:39,683 --> 00:53:42,743
No! No, I've never once
spoken to him about it. Never.

711
00:53:43,453 --> 00:53:46,445
But you know without even talking to
him that that's what he feels about it.

712
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:49,583
Yes.

713
00:53:51,061 --> 00:53:52,221
Lucy.

714
00:53:52,529 --> 00:53:54,224
Don't you know that I love you!

715
00:53:56,466 --> 00:53:57,956
Yes, I do.

716
00:53:58,068 --> 00:53:59,501
Don't you love me?

717
00:54:01,304 --> 00:54:02,862
Yes, I do.

718
00:54:03,273 --> 00:54:06,674
Let me tell my mother when I get home
that we're really engaged.

719
00:54:07,310 --> 00:54:08,937
- No. No.
- Because of your father!

720
00:54:09,045 --> 00:54:11,809
- Because it's better!
- Isn't it your father?

721
00:54:12,882 --> 00:54:15,783
Lt's his ideals I'm thinking of.
Yes.

722
00:54:21,491 --> 00:54:22,719
I know what you mean.

723
00:54:23,260 --> 00:54:25,251
But I daresay I don't care
for your father's ideals...

724
00:54:25,395 --> 00:54:27,295
any more than he does for mine.

725
00:54:57,694 --> 00:55:00,356
It's so nice of you to always dress
for the evenings, Georgie.

726
00:55:01,398 --> 00:55:05,664
Uncle George used to, and so did father,
but they stopped a long time ago.

727
00:55:06,736 --> 00:55:10,069
There are a great many
more automobiles than there used to be.

728
00:55:10,206 --> 00:55:12,106
Eugene is right about that.

729
00:55:12,475 --> 00:55:13,669
Why?

730
00:55:14,177 --> 00:55:15,769
I've begun to agree with George...

731
00:55:15,912 --> 00:55:20,178
about them being more of a fad
than anything else, like roller skates.

732
00:55:20,283 --> 00:55:23,878
They're probably a mistake.

733
00:55:23,987 --> 00:55:27,320
I don't believe we'll see so many
next summer as we do right now.

734
00:55:27,424 --> 00:55:30,916
Besides, people won't permit
the automobiles to be used.

735
00:55:31,027 --> 00:55:33,791
You can see how
they spoil the bikes...

736
00:55:33,930 --> 00:55:36,228
People seem to hate them.

737
00:55:36,333 --> 00:55:39,734
I should be sorry to see
such a thing happen to Eugene.

738
00:55:39,836 --> 00:55:42,272
I shouldn't be surprised
if there was a law...

739
00:55:42,272 --> 00:55:45,708
forbidding the sale of automobiles.
Just the way there is with...

740
00:55:45,809 --> 00:55:47,174
Summer's dying.

741
00:55:48,078 --> 00:55:50,546
How quickly it goes
once it starts to die.

742
00:56:04,527 --> 00:56:07,894
Isn't it queer how your mother
can use such words?

743
00:56:08,665 --> 00:56:10,257
What words you talking about?

744
00:56:10,600 --> 00:56:14,127
Words like..."die and dying".

745
00:56:14,471 --> 00:56:17,702
I don't see how she can bear to use
them so soon after your poor father...

746
00:56:17,774 --> 00:56:21,870
- It seems you are using them yourself!
- I? Never!

747
00:56:22,779 --> 00:56:24,644
- Yes, you did.
- When?

748
00:56:24,781 --> 00:56:25,873
Just this minute.

749
00:56:27,117 --> 00:56:30,177
You mean when
I repeated what she said?

750
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:32,720
That's hardly the same thing,
George!

751
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:36,551
I don't think you'll convince anybody
that my mother's unfeeling!

752
00:56:36,760 --> 00:56:40,161
I'm not trying to convince
anybody of anything!

753
00:56:40,263 --> 00:56:43,130
I mean,
that merely in my opinion...

754
00:56:44,834 --> 00:56:47,637
well, perhaps
it's just as wise for me...

755
00:56:47,637 --> 00:56:49,867
to keep my opinion to myself.

756
00:56:55,545 --> 00:56:57,172
There's just one thing I hope.

757
00:56:57,313 --> 00:56:59,804
I hope at least she doesn't
leave off her full mourning...

758
00:56:59,983 --> 00:57:02,747
on the very anniversary
of Wilbur's death!

759
00:57:15,365 --> 00:57:17,890
Beautiful!

760
00:57:18,034 --> 00:57:19,626
Of course you are.

761
00:57:19,769 --> 00:57:21,430
Riffraff.

762
00:57:23,239 --> 00:57:25,070
- Who is going?
- Not I.

763
00:57:25,175 --> 00:57:27,473
Summer's gone
and I've hardly seen Lucy!

764
00:57:28,578 --> 00:57:31,308
- I've missed my best girl.
- We all do!

765
00:57:31,781 --> 00:57:34,409
Well, Lucy's spending some time
with a school friend, Major.

766
00:57:35,151 --> 00:57:39,315
Eugene, I hear someone's
opened another automobile shop...

767
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,422
somewhere in the suburbs.

768
00:57:41,524 --> 00:57:44,721
I imagine they will either drive you
out of business...

769
00:57:44,861 --> 00:57:47,694
or else the two of you will drive
all the rest of us off the streets.

770
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,232
Well, if we do,
we'll even things up...

771
00:57:49,232 --> 00:57:52,531
by making the streets five times
as long as they're now.

772
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,335
And how do you propose
to do that?

773
00:57:56,473 --> 00:57:58,668
Well, it isn't the distance from
the centre of a town that counts...

774
00:57:58,808 --> 00:58:00,776
it's the time it takes to get there.

775
00:58:01,711 --> 00:58:03,372
This town's already spreading...

776
00:58:03,480 --> 00:58:07,473
and automobiles are going to carry city
streets clear out to the county line.

777
00:58:08,051 --> 00:58:09,746
Dream on fair son!

778
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,915
But if people are going to be
moving out that far...

779
00:58:12,055 --> 00:58:16,958
the real estate values in the old part
of town will be stretched pretty thin.

780
00:58:17,060 --> 00:58:20,621
So, you and your automobiles
will ruin all your old friends, Eugene.

781
00:58:22,031 --> 00:58:24,499
Do you really think that they're
going to change the face of the land?

782
00:58:24,634 --> 00:58:26,192
Oh, they're already doing it,
Major...

783
00:58:26,636 --> 00:58:29,799
and it can't be stopped.
Automobiles...

784
00:58:29,906 --> 00:58:32,306
Automobiles
are a useless nuisance.

785
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:39,070
What did you say, Georgie?

786
00:58:39,415 --> 00:58:42,179
I said, "all automobiles
are a nuisance".

787
00:58:42,819 --> 00:58:45,219
They are never going to amount
to anything more than a nuisance...

788
00:58:45,321 --> 00:58:48,188
and they had no business
being invented.

789
00:58:53,696 --> 00:58:56,130
Of course you forget that
Mr. Morgan makes them...

790
00:58:57,333 --> 00:58:59,631
and also did his share
in inventing them.

791
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:05,538
If you weren't so thoughtless,
he might think you rather offensive.

792
00:59:07,043 --> 00:59:08,772
That would be too bad!

793
00:59:09,412 --> 00:59:11,744
I don't think I could survive it.

794
00:59:22,292 --> 00:59:25,523
Well, I'm not sure he's wrong,
about automobiles.

795
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:30,062
For all their speed forward, they may
be a step backward for civilization.

796
00:59:30,700 --> 00:59:34,837
Maybe they won't add to the beauty of
the world, to the light of men's souls.

797
00:59:34,837 --> 00:59:36,202
I am not sure.

798
00:59:37,240 --> 00:59:39,003
But automobiles have come...

799
00:59:39,175 --> 00:59:43,373
and almost all outward things
are going to be different...

800
00:59:43,513 --> 00:59:45,310
because of what they bring.

801
00:59:45,682 --> 00:59:49,243
They are going to alter war
and, they are going to alter peace.

802
00:59:49,786 --> 00:59:53,244
And I think men's minds are going to be
changed in subtle ways...

803
00:59:53,389 --> 00:59:55,254
because of the automobile.

804
00:59:55,425 --> 00:59:58,792
But you can't have the immense
outward changes that they will cause...

805
00:59:59,429 --> 01:00:01,761
without some inward ones,
and it may be...

806
01:00:02,398 --> 01:00:03,733
that George is right...

807
01:00:03,733 --> 01:00:06,725
and that the spiritual alteration
will be bad for us.

808
01:00:07,370 --> 01:00:09,668
Perhaps 10 or 20 years
from now...

809
01:00:09,839 --> 01:00:12,672
if we can see the inward change
in men by that time...

810
01:00:12,942 --> 01:00:16,207
I shouldn't be able to defend the gas
engine, I'd have to agree with him...

811
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:19,138
that automobiles...

812
01:00:20,850 --> 01:00:23,182
had no business being invented.

813
01:00:29,258 --> 01:00:33,422
Well, Major, I hope you'll excuse me.
I have a prior engagement and...

814
01:00:33,563 --> 01:00:35,360
much as I prefer to linger.

815
01:00:39,502 --> 01:00:41,197
I'll bid you all a good evening.

816
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,538
Good evening.

817
01:00:45,208 --> 01:00:47,073
- Good night.
- Good night.

818
01:01:07,697 --> 01:01:10,393
Georgie dear, what did you mean?

819
01:01:10,500 --> 01:01:13,162
- Just what I said...
- Well, he was hurt.

820
01:01:13,269 --> 01:01:14,896
I don't why he should be.

821
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:17,530
I didn't say anything about him.

822
01:01:18,274 --> 01:01:20,299
Anyway, he didn't seem hurt to me.

823
01:01:20,777 --> 01:01:22,711
He seemed perfectly cheerful.

824
01:01:25,148 --> 01:01:28,413
- What makes you think that he was hurt?
- Because I know him.

825
01:01:28,985 --> 01:01:31,385
You didn't mean him, you say,
Georgie?

826
01:01:33,389 --> 01:01:35,357
By Jove, but you're puzzlement!

827
01:01:36,059 --> 01:01:37,822
In what way, may I ask, sir?

828
01:01:38,394 --> 01:01:42,660
Well, thank you. It certainly is
a new way to court a pretty girl!

829
01:01:43,399 --> 01:01:46,891
For a fellow to go out of his way
to try to make an enemy of her father...

830
01:01:47,036 --> 01:01:48,628
by attacking his business.

831
01:01:49,205 --> 01:01:50,763
That's a novel way
to win a woman!

832
01:01:50,907 --> 01:01:54,172
Eugene would never be
anyone's enemy. He just couldn't.

833
01:01:54,744 --> 01:01:56,575
Last of all, Georgie's.

834
01:02:16,699 --> 01:02:17,859
Well...

835
01:02:19,068 --> 01:02:21,764
it certainly wasn't
a successful dinner!

836
01:02:29,679 --> 01:02:31,237
I've come to say good night.

837
01:02:35,151 --> 01:02:36,277
Good night.

838
01:02:41,624 --> 01:02:43,785
You needn't look so worried,
old lady.

839
01:02:43,993 --> 01:02:46,154
I won't be tactless
with Morgan anymore.

840
01:02:46,896 --> 01:02:49,524
After this, I'm just going
to stay out of his way.

841
01:02:50,066 --> 01:02:52,500
Darling, tell me something.
Why don't you like Eugene?

842
01:02:52,802 --> 01:02:54,997
I've had the feeling from the very first
that you never liked him...

843
01:02:55,104 --> 01:02:56,867
and now I know
that feeling's right.

844
01:02:59,509 --> 01:03:01,272
That seems so queer to me...

845
01:03:01,410 --> 01:03:03,105
given how you feel about
his daughter!

846
01:03:03,212 --> 01:03:05,442
How do I feel about his daughter?

847
01:03:06,215 --> 01:03:09,616
You've certainly never looked at another
girl since Lucy Morgan came to town!

848
01:03:10,820 --> 01:03:12,879
And surely,
you've been best friends.

849
01:03:13,256 --> 01:03:14,382
What of it?

850
01:03:14,690 --> 01:03:16,180
Lt's like what was said
by your grandfather.

851
01:03:16,292 --> 01:03:20,096
I can't see how you can feel so
interested in a girl and not be...

852
01:03:20,096 --> 01:03:21,723
pleasantly disposed to her father.

853
01:03:22,899 --> 01:03:26,096
Well, I admit. There may be something
in what you say, but...

854
01:03:27,170 --> 01:03:30,697
the truth is, up until recently, I've
only ever thought of Lucy as Lucy...

855
01:03:30,840 --> 01:03:32,432
and Morgan as Morgan.

856
01:03:33,009 --> 01:03:35,569
I've never really thought of her
as somebody's daughter.

857
01:03:38,648 --> 01:03:41,412
Probably you've got plenty of friends
that don't much care for your son!

858
01:03:41,517 --> 01:03:43,417
Not at all! And if I knew anyone
felt like that, I would...

859
01:03:43,553 --> 01:03:44,986
There, there Mother!

860
01:03:46,055 --> 01:03:47,488
I really want to go to bed,
Mother.

861
01:03:47,857 --> 01:03:48,915
Good night.

862
01:03:49,525 --> 01:03:51,959
But George... you would like him
if you just let yourself.

863
01:03:58,234 --> 01:04:00,168
Let's not talk of it any more.

864
01:04:00,937 --> 01:04:02,336
Good night, old lady.

865
01:04:13,449 --> 01:04:14,814
Good night.

866
01:04:27,964 --> 01:04:29,727
Why... hello, George!

867
01:04:37,006 --> 01:04:38,098
How do you do?

868
01:04:40,076 --> 01:04:41,338
I...

869
01:04:42,211 --> 01:04:43,644
I trust...

870
01:04:46,215 --> 01:04:48,240
I trust you had a pleasant time.

871
01:04:49,318 --> 01:04:52,151
I hope you are extremely...

872
01:04:52,588 --> 01:04:54,112
I beg your pardon?

873
01:04:55,658 --> 01:04:57,592
Nothing
of the slightest importance!

874
01:04:58,261 --> 01:04:59,660
Good afternoon.

875
01:05:16,445 --> 01:05:17,742
Riffraff!

876
01:05:19,882 --> 01:05:21,042
Riffraff!

877
01:05:21,651 --> 01:05:24,176
Riffraff! Riffraff!

878
01:05:31,027 --> 01:05:33,257
George! George!

879
01:05:33,362 --> 01:05:35,523
Now what on earth do you want?

880
01:05:44,740 --> 01:05:48,733
Oh, for the Lord's sake!
What in the world is wrong with you?

881
01:05:48,911 --> 01:05:51,277
I don't think I can stand it!

882
01:05:51,414 --> 01:05:55,612
You wouldn't treat anybody in the
world this way, except for old Fanny.

883
01:05:55,751 --> 01:06:00,245
"Old Fanny," you say...
"lt's nobody but old Fanny...

884
01:06:00,389 --> 01:06:03,449
so I'll kick her.
Nobody will resent it!"

885
01:06:03,693 --> 01:06:07,151
And you're right! I haven't got
anybody or anything...

886
01:06:07,363 --> 01:06:11,060
in the whole world
since my brother died.

887
01:06:11,567 --> 01:06:14,035
Nobody!
Nothing!

888
01:06:14,370 --> 01:06:16,099
- Nothing!
- My Lord!

889
01:06:16,339 --> 01:06:20,002
I would never, never...
in the whole world have told you...

890
01:06:20,142 --> 01:06:24,636
had I seen that somebody else had told
you, that you'd found out by yourself.

891
01:06:24,780 --> 01:06:29,046
Somebody else had told me what?
I'd found out what for myself?

892
01:06:29,418 --> 01:06:32,785
How people are talking
about your mother!

893
01:06:34,924 --> 01:06:36,323
- What did you say?
- Of course...

894
01:06:36,459 --> 01:06:39,792
I understood what you were doing.
It puzzled other people at first...

895
01:06:39,962 --> 01:06:42,123
when you began to be rude
to Eugene.

896
01:06:42,264 --> 01:06:45,324
They couldn't understand how
you could behave in such a way...

897
01:06:45,434 --> 01:06:48,460
when you were so interested in Lucy,
but I knew...

898
01:06:48,537 --> 01:06:52,871
you'd give Lucy up fast if it became
a question of your mother's reputation.

899
01:06:52,975 --> 01:06:57,002
Because you said that reputation
is the most important thing!

900
01:06:57,179 --> 01:07:00,342
- What are you talking about?
- Everybody knows it!

901
01:07:00,516 --> 01:07:02,416
Everybody in town knows...

902
01:07:02,585 --> 01:07:06,385
that your mother has never cared for
any other man in her life except Eugene.

903
01:07:06,589 --> 01:07:08,022
Poor Wilbur...

904
01:07:08,157 --> 01:07:11,183
he was the only man alive
that didn't know it!

905
01:07:14,930 --> 01:07:19,196
You say that they believe that
my mother is in love with that man!

906
01:07:19,802 --> 01:07:22,669
- Of course!
- Just because he came over here?

907
01:07:22,772 --> 01:07:24,501
And they went out driving?

908
01:07:25,441 --> 01:07:30,003
That they think that she was in love
with him, before my father died?

909
01:07:30,179 --> 01:07:33,945
Why George... don't you know
that's what they say?

910
01:07:34,150 --> 01:07:35,549
You must know...

911
01:07:35,651 --> 01:07:40,145
that everybody in this town says that
they are going to be married very soon!

912
01:07:43,926 --> 01:07:46,417
God knows
I'm sorry for you George.

913
01:07:46,562 --> 01:07:47,927
I wanted to say so...

914
01:07:48,064 --> 01:07:52,433
but I'm only poor old lonely
Aunt Fanny so whatever she says...

915
01:07:52,535 --> 01:07:55,436
even if it's in sympathy,
pick on her for it.

916
01:07:55,538 --> 01:07:58,837
It's only poor old lonely
Aunt Fanny.

917
01:08:00,609 --> 01:08:01,906
Someone must have told you!

918
01:08:03,079 --> 01:08:04,341
- Who told you?
- What?

919
01:08:05,047 --> 01:08:06,776
Who told you there was talk?

920
01:08:07,116 --> 01:08:10,643
Where is this talk? Where does it
come from? Who does it?

921
01:08:10,753 --> 01:08:13,881
Sorry... I suppose
pretty much everybody!

922
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:17,288
- Who said so?
- I... heard.

923
01:08:17,493 --> 01:08:18,983
Where did you get hold of it?

924
01:08:20,663 --> 01:08:21,527
Answer me!

925
01:08:22,398 --> 01:08:25,856
I hardly think
it would be fair to give names.

926
01:08:27,736 --> 01:08:30,933
One of your most intimate friends
is that mother of Charlie Johnson's...

927
01:08:31,040 --> 01:08:34,373
- has she ever mentioned it to you?
- She may have intimated...

928
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:36,945
I said... has she ever
talked about it with you?

929
01:08:37,046 --> 01:08:39,742
She's a very lovely
discreet woman, George...

930
01:08:39,849 --> 01:08:41,146
but she may have int...

931
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:43,547
I saw two talking
about it on the street.

932
01:08:43,719 --> 01:08:45,812
- Do you deny it?
- I...

933
01:08:46,088 --> 01:08:47,919
Do you deny it?

934
01:08:49,625 --> 01:08:51,058
No.

935
01:08:54,663 --> 01:08:56,858
What are you going to do,
George?

936
01:08:58,767 --> 01:09:00,132
George?

937
01:09:01,237 --> 01:09:03,501
George!
What are you going to do?

938
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:06,866
George!
I didn't...

939
01:09:06,976 --> 01:09:08,341
where are you going?

940
01:09:12,681 --> 01:09:14,308
Mr. Amberson!

941
01:09:14,550 --> 01:09:18,680
I mean, Mr. Minafer.
I'm really delighted!

942
01:09:18,787 --> 01:09:21,984
Mrs. Johnson! I've come
to ask you a few questions.

943
01:09:22,158 --> 01:09:23,682
Why certainly...
anything I can do to help...

944
01:09:23,792 --> 01:09:26,693
You were talking with my Aunt
Fanny about my mother this afternoon?

945
01:09:26,829 --> 01:09:31,698
Lf we were discussing your mother, it
must have been a pleasant conversation.

946
01:09:31,834 --> 01:09:34,234
I don't intend
to waste time, Mrs. Johnson.

947
01:09:35,004 --> 01:09:36,528
You were talking...

948
01:09:37,072 --> 01:09:39,506
You were discussing a scandal
that involved my mother's name.

949
01:09:40,609 --> 01:09:42,167
Mr. Minafer!

950
01:09:42,411 --> 01:09:45,039
My Aunt said that you
repeated the scandal to her!

951
01:09:45,181 --> 01:09:48,150
I don't think your Aunt
could have said that.

952
01:09:48,617 --> 01:09:53,111
We may have discussed matters that have
been topics of conversation around town.

953
01:09:53,255 --> 01:09:55,587
Yes! I think you may have!

954
01:09:55,891 --> 01:09:57,722
That's why I'm here
and that's what I intend to find out!

955
01:09:57,860 --> 01:10:00,260
Don't tell me what you intend,
please!

956
01:10:00,930 --> 01:10:05,094
And I would prefer that you keep your
voice not quite so loud in this house...

957
01:10:05,201 --> 01:10:07,362
which I happen to own.

958
01:10:08,470 --> 01:10:12,065
Now... if I discussed
this matter with your Aunt...

959
01:10:12,174 --> 01:10:15,610
you can make sure that
it was in the most charitable spirit...

960
01:10:15,778 --> 01:10:19,612
and without sharing people's disposition
to put an evil connotation to it.

961
01:10:19,682 --> 01:10:20,910
Other people!

962
01:10:21,050 --> 01:10:23,314
That's what I'd like to know
about... these other people!

963
01:10:23,419 --> 01:10:25,011
I beg your pardon!

964
01:10:25,187 --> 01:10:27,018
You say that other
people talk about this?

965
01:10:27,122 --> 01:10:28,885
- Well, I presume they do.
- How many?

966
01:10:29,058 --> 01:10:32,289
- What?
- How many other people talk about it?

967
01:10:32,461 --> 01:10:36,295
Really, this is not a courtroom
and I am not a defendant in a lawsuit.

968
01:10:36,498 --> 01:10:37,430
You may be.

969
01:10:38,033 --> 01:10:40,399
I intend to know just
who dared to say these things...

970
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:42,902
even if I have to force my way
into every house in this town.

971
01:10:43,038 --> 01:10:45,404
I'm going to make them
take every word of it back.

972
01:10:45,541 --> 01:10:49,375
I intend to find out the name of every
slanderer who spoke of this to you.

973
01:10:49,478 --> 01:10:51,036
I mean to know!

974
01:10:51,180 --> 01:10:54,513
You'll know something pretty quick!
You'll know you are out on the street.

975
01:10:54,717 --> 01:10:56,742
Now
please to leave my house!

976
01:11:02,524 --> 01:11:05,584
Now you have done it!

977
01:11:05,861 --> 01:11:07,089
What do you mean?

978
01:11:07,763 --> 01:11:10,459
What have I done
that wasn't honorable and right?

979
01:11:11,033 --> 01:11:13,934
Do you think these riffraff can go
around bandying my mother's name?

980
01:11:14,036 --> 01:11:15,526
They can now!

981
01:11:17,273 --> 01:11:18,467
What do you mean by that?

982
01:11:18,841 --> 01:11:22,572
Gossip is never fatal, Georgie,
until it is denied.

983
01:11:22,878 --> 01:11:24,402
Gossip almost never does any harm...

984
01:11:24,546 --> 01:11:27,947
until some defender
makes a controversy.

985
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:31,175
See here! I didn't come
to listen to philosophies.

986
01:11:31,487 --> 01:11:34,183
You asked me what you have done,
and I'm telling you.

987
01:11:34,390 --> 01:11:36,483
People who have repeated
a slander either...

988
01:11:36,558 --> 01:11:39,391
get ashamed or forget about it.
Challenge them...

989
01:11:39,461 --> 01:11:42,794
and in self-defense
they believe everything they've said.

990
01:11:42,898 --> 01:11:44,490
What do you think I've been doing?

991
01:11:44,633 --> 01:11:49,502
Nothing helpful! The more you do,
the more harm you'll do.

992
01:11:49,605 --> 01:11:51,402
Didn't you understand me
when I told you...

993
01:11:51,507 --> 01:11:54,670
that these people say that
my mother means to marry this man?

994
01:11:55,177 --> 01:11:57,509
I don't see anything
precisely monstrous...

995
01:11:57,646 --> 01:12:00,706
about two people getting married when
they are free and care about each other!

996
01:12:00,816 --> 01:12:02,909
What's the matter
with them marrying?

997
01:12:03,018 --> 01:12:05,043
Lt would be monstrous!

998
01:12:06,689 --> 01:12:09,624
Don't be so theatrical!
Come back here!

999
01:12:09,758 --> 01:12:12,318
George, you mustn't speak
to your mother about this.

1000
01:12:22,137 --> 01:12:23,695
Get out of my way!

1001
01:12:30,813 --> 01:12:35,045
And I tried on this ridiculous dress...
You should've seen it, it didn't fit me.

1002
01:12:35,150 --> 01:12:38,415
It was so funny.
I laughed for hours.

1003
01:12:39,722 --> 01:12:40,882
Here you go, sir.

1004
01:12:41,490 --> 01:12:45,586
- You should've seen the shopkeeper...
- So, what are you going to do?

1005
01:12:45,728 --> 01:12:48,424
I don't know,
but I'll think of something...

1006
01:12:49,131 --> 01:12:50,564
Can I get you anything else?

1007
01:12:52,468 --> 01:12:55,995
- We want another couple of beers.
- All right. Beers.

1008
01:13:21,063 --> 01:13:22,894
One...

1009
01:13:22,965 --> 01:13:24,956
- two.
- Now, eight.

1010
01:13:25,134 --> 01:13:27,125
Turn, turn.

1011
01:13:27,736 --> 01:13:29,101
One, two.

1012
01:13:30,439 --> 01:13:35,308
Ok.
One, two, three, and...

1013
01:13:35,477 --> 01:13:37,570
- Turn.
- One, two...

1014
01:13:39,882 --> 01:13:41,873
Heavens! Oh, I'm sorry!

1015
01:13:47,656 --> 01:13:48,782
Yes?

1016
01:13:50,492 --> 01:13:51,789
Oh, it's you.

1017
01:13:55,297 --> 01:13:56,764
Oh, indeed I should!

1018
01:13:58,801 --> 01:13:59,995
Of course!

1019
01:14:01,737 --> 01:14:03,728
Then I'll expect you around noon.

1020
01:14:05,140 --> 01:14:08,473
Yes! All right! I'll see you then.

1021
01:14:08,777 --> 01:14:09,937
Good-bye, Eugene.

1022
01:15:05,400 --> 01:15:08,369
You needn't mind, Mary! I'll see
who it is and what they want.

1023
01:15:09,104 --> 01:15:11,868
- Probably it's only a peddler!
- Thank you, sir, Mr. George!

1024
01:15:22,150 --> 01:15:23,583
How do you do, George!

1025
01:15:23,986 --> 01:15:27,319
Mrs. Minafer expects to go driving
with me, I believe, so...

1026
01:15:27,890 --> 01:15:30,425
Would you be kind to sand her
the word I'm here?

1027
01:15:30,425 --> 01:15:31,517
No.

1028
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:36,424
I beg your pardon?

1029
01:15:37,599 --> 01:15:39,965
- I said she's, she...
- I heard you.

1030
01:15:40,335 --> 01:15:43,031
You said you had an engagement
with my mother, and I told you no!

1031
01:15:45,541 --> 01:15:48,806
What is the... the difficulty?

1032
01:15:49,077 --> 01:15:52,513
My mother will have no interest
in knowing that you came for her today.

1033
01:15:52,681 --> 01:15:54,239
Or any other day.

1034
01:15:54,750 --> 01:15:57,116
I am afraid
I do not understand you!

1035
01:15:58,120 --> 01:16:00,748
I doubt that I could make it
much plainer, but I'll try!

1036
01:16:01,657 --> 01:16:03,921
You are not welcome
in this house, Mr. Morgan.

1037
01:16:04,092 --> 01:16:06,356
Not now, or at any other time.

1038
01:16:09,197 --> 01:16:11,165
Perhaps you'll understand this!

1039
01:17:03,619 --> 01:17:04,950
Georgie!

1040
01:17:05,087 --> 01:17:07,851
Dear, I waited lunch almost an hour
for you, but you didn't come!

1041
01:17:08,056 --> 01:17:09,717
Did you lunch out somewhere?

1042
01:17:10,292 --> 01:17:11,224
Yes.

1043
01:17:11,326 --> 01:17:13,157
- Did you have plenty to eat?
- Yes.

1044
01:17:13,261 --> 01:17:14,626
Are you sure?

1045
01:17:16,064 --> 01:17:17,895
Wouldn't you like Maggie to get you
something from the dining room?

1046
01:17:18,033 --> 01:17:20,558
They can bring it to you here
if you think it would be cozier.

1047
01:17:21,103 --> 01:17:22,161
No.

1048
01:17:24,239 --> 01:17:26,764
Gracious, Georgie,
you have been investing!

1049
01:17:35,617 --> 01:17:37,676
That was very nice of you, Georgie.

1050
01:17:41,423 --> 01:17:44,415
I ought to have had it framed myself
when I gave it to you.

1051
01:19:02,904 --> 01:19:05,338
Isabel?
I'm sorry to disturb you...

1052
01:19:05,507 --> 01:19:07,998
but I have got to speak
to you... upstairs!

1053
01:19:08,977 --> 01:19:13,710
I don't mean to be mysterious.
But, recent events compel me...

1054
01:19:13,882 --> 01:19:16,874
to have to speak to you about
a very, very serious matter.

1055
01:19:30,098 --> 01:19:31,998
I can guess what that was about!

1056
01:19:32,134 --> 01:19:34,261
He's just told her
what you did to Eugene!

1057
01:19:34,402 --> 01:19:37,269
- You go on back to your room!
- You're not going in there!

1058
01:19:37,472 --> 01:19:39,940
George! George!
You get away from that door!

1059
01:19:40,075 --> 01:19:41,804
George! You listen to me!

1060
01:19:41,943 --> 01:19:43,706
- Let go of me, you!
- Come here.

1061
01:19:43,812 --> 01:19:45,803
Here, look...
We are going upstairs...

1062
01:19:45,947 --> 01:19:49,940
you are going to go up those stairs
and leave them alone for a change.

1063
01:19:50,619 --> 01:19:55,386
- This is ridiculous!
- Ridiculous is squabbling at that door.

1064
01:19:55,490 --> 01:19:57,822
You sit down and you hush up!

1065
01:19:58,160 --> 01:19:59,354
There.

1066
01:19:59,895 --> 01:20:02,227
I thought you knew about everything!

1067
01:20:02,397 --> 01:20:06,857
Lf I even dreamed you'd go out
making a big tragedy of it all...

1068
01:20:07,002 --> 01:20:10,028
Look here! Lt seems to me you've
been taking a pretty different tack.

1069
01:20:12,040 --> 01:20:15,737
I know! They haven't done
anybody any harm.

1070
01:20:16,144 --> 01:20:21,047
Isabel was really a good wife to Wilbur
and she was always true to him.

1071
01:20:21,349 --> 01:20:23,510
I'm not doing myself a bit of good...

1072
01:20:23,652 --> 01:20:26,621
going around and ruining them...

1073
01:20:26,855 --> 01:20:28,584
I suppose you think I'm doing that.

1074
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,885
Yes! Yes I do!

1075
01:20:31,092 --> 01:20:32,389
On the contrary!

1076
01:20:33,662 --> 01:20:36,153
I'm trying to save my mother
from a great calamity!

1077
01:20:36,364 --> 01:20:38,958
I think there is something
you ought to know, George.

1078
01:20:39,401 --> 01:20:41,961
I'd leave your mother alone,
if I were you.

1079
01:20:42,103 --> 01:20:43,730
I don't think she is very well.

1080
01:20:43,872 --> 01:20:46,466
It's nothing! Lt's nothing at all!

1081
01:20:46,641 --> 01:20:50,839
Well, she's trying to keep it from you,
but she goes to a doctor regularly.

1082
01:20:52,714 --> 01:20:56,115
You stay here!
You stay here and let them alone.

1083
01:20:56,451 --> 01:20:59,978
Don't go down. Let her alone.

1084
01:21:14,302 --> 01:21:16,600
One thing you can never doubt,
beloved boy...

1085
01:21:17,405 --> 01:21:21,000
I could never care for anything in the
world as I care for you. Never!

1086
01:21:22,244 --> 01:21:24,007
- Never.
- I know...

1087
01:21:24,246 --> 01:21:26,146
No matter what happens.

1088
01:21:42,697 --> 01:21:44,392
I want you to read this.

1089
01:22:03,885 --> 01:22:07,719
Dearest one, yesterday I thought
the time had come...

1090
01:22:07,889 --> 01:22:10,756
when I could ask you to marry me,
and you were dear enough to say...

1091
01:22:12,127 --> 01:22:14,027
some day it might come to that.

1092
01:22:14,162 --> 01:22:17,996
But now we are faced,
not with slander...

1093
01:22:18,133 --> 01:22:20,795
and not with our own fear of it,
because we haven't any, but...

1094
01:22:22,270 --> 01:22:24,397
with someone else's fear of it...

1095
01:22:24,773 --> 01:22:26,502
your son's, and...

1096
01:22:27,242 --> 01:22:31,338
dearest woman in the world,
I know what your son is to you...

1097
01:22:31,513 --> 01:22:33,071
and it frightens me!

1098
01:22:33,348 --> 01:22:36,613
I don't think he will change.
Forty can't tell twenty about this.

1099
01:22:36,685 --> 01:22:39,347
Twenty can find out
only by getting to be forty...

1100
01:22:40,689 --> 01:22:44,318
and so we come to this, dear.

1101
01:22:46,061 --> 01:22:47,858
Where you live your own life...

1102
01:22:48,630 --> 01:22:50,063
your way...

1103
01:22:51,232 --> 01:22:52,927
or George's way?

1104
01:22:54,836 --> 01:22:57,100
I'm saying too much
for wisdom, I fear...

1105
01:22:58,606 --> 01:23:01,097
but oh my dear,
won't you be strong?

1106
01:23:01,943 --> 01:23:05,344
And such a little, short,
strength it would need.

1107
01:23:07,148 --> 01:23:09,844
Don't strike my life down twice,
dear.

1108
01:23:10,618 --> 01:23:12,848
Because this time,
I've not deserved it.

1109
01:23:17,092 --> 01:23:20,425
The worst of it is, he thinks
he's been such a hero...

1110
01:23:20,562 --> 01:23:22,189
and Isabel does too.

1111
01:23:22,330 --> 01:23:24,730
She goes about,
overseeing the packing...

1112
01:23:24,899 --> 01:23:28,198
and pretending to be perfectly
cheerful about what he's making her do.

1113
01:23:28,370 --> 01:23:31,737
And all the while,
it's almost killing her.

1114
01:23:31,973 --> 01:23:33,998
What he said to your father!

1115
01:23:38,913 --> 01:23:39,902
Now...

1116
01:23:40,682 --> 01:23:44,641
you must come and see me.
After they've gone of course!

1117
01:23:44,819 --> 01:23:47,583
I'll go crazy if I don't see
something of people.

1118
01:23:48,056 --> 01:23:51,617
I'm sure you'll come
and see me as often as you can.

1119
01:23:51,793 --> 01:23:56,526
I know you well to think you'll be
sensitive about being reminded of George.

1120
01:23:56,731 --> 01:24:01,065
You're much too well balanced to let
anything effect you deeply about that.

1121
01:24:01,236 --> 01:24:03,500
Oh, that monkey!

1122
01:24:05,373 --> 01:24:08,467
Where's your father? I should say
good-bye to him before I go.

1123
01:24:08,710 --> 01:24:10,610
He's just stepped out, I'm afraid.

1124
01:25:07,135 --> 01:25:09,603
Good afternoon, Mr. Minafer,
Mr. Johnson.

1125
01:25:10,572 --> 01:25:12,267
- Hello, Suzanna.
- Hello, Charlie.

1126
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:14,032
- How are you?
- How is your mother?

1127
01:25:14,242 --> 01:25:16,972
- Well, she is the same.
- I hope she is on the mend.

1128
01:25:17,178 --> 01:25:19,271
Well, we hope so too,
the doctor's into see her.

1129
01:25:19,481 --> 01:25:20,539
Well, that is good.

1130
01:25:21,015 --> 01:25:24,041
- Look what I bought.
- It's lovely!

1131
01:25:31,392 --> 01:25:34,225
- Hello, George!
- Lucy, I want to tell you something!

1132
01:25:34,429 --> 01:25:36,397
Well, I hope it's
a lively something then!

1133
01:25:36,664 --> 01:25:39,394
Poppa's been so glum today,
he's scarcely spoken to me.

1134
01:25:39,601 --> 01:25:44,300
- I'd be glad to hear a funny story!
- Well, it may seem one to you!

1135
01:25:50,211 --> 01:25:53,977
To begin with, you went away
and you didn't even let me know.

1136
01:25:55,116 --> 01:25:59,075
- Not a word! Not even a line!
- I know. I trotted off for some visits!

1137
01:25:59,287 --> 01:26:01,653
- At least you could've said something!
- I know.

1138
01:26:02,056 --> 01:26:05,048
Don't you remember, George?
We had a terrible quarrel and...

1139
01:26:05,126 --> 01:26:08,562
hadn't spoken to each other
all the way home, from a long drive.

1140
01:26:09,297 --> 01:26:11,629
And, well, as we couldn't play
together like good children...

1141
01:26:11,799 --> 01:26:14,131
of course it was plain that we
ought not to play together at all.

1142
01:26:14,302 --> 01:26:15,997
- Play?
- Yes.

1143
01:26:18,806 --> 01:26:20,205
Well, what I mean is...

1144
01:26:20,608 --> 01:26:23,270
we had come to the point
where it was time to quit playing...

1145
01:26:23,444 --> 01:26:24,809
whatever it was we were playing.

1146
01:26:24,979 --> 01:26:26,742
At being lovers, you mean,
don't you?

1147
01:26:27,248 --> 01:26:29,842
Something like that! Lt was absurd!

1148
01:26:30,585 --> 01:26:33,110
- It needn't have been!
- No, it couldn't help but be.

1149
01:26:33,288 --> 01:26:36,587
The way I am and the way you are,
it could never have been anything else.

1150
01:26:42,597 --> 01:26:44,792
Well, this time I'm going.
That's what I wanted to say!

1151
01:26:44,999 --> 01:26:46,830
I'm leaving tomorrow night
indefinitely!

1152
01:26:47,068 --> 01:26:49,036
Well, I hope you'll have
ever so jolly a time.

1153
01:26:49,437 --> 01:26:50,665
I don't expect to!

1154
01:26:50,805 --> 01:26:52,932
Well then if I were you,
I don't think I'd go!

1155
01:26:53,675 --> 01:26:55,905
Lucy! This is our
last walk together!

1156
01:26:56,077 --> 01:26:58,375
Evidently, if you're
leaving tomorrow night!

1157
01:27:00,081 --> 01:27:03,778
Lucy! This may be the last time
I'll ever see you, in my life!

1158
01:27:04,018 --> 01:27:06,543
Well, you're not going
away are you, to live?

1159
01:27:06,888 --> 01:27:10,085
- No.
- And, well, you'd be back for visits.

1160
01:27:10,291 --> 01:27:11,781
I don't know when I'm coming back.

1161
01:27:12,694 --> 01:27:15,128
Mother and I are leaving tomorrow
night on a trip around the world.

1162
01:27:15,563 --> 01:27:16,962
Your mother's going with you?

1163
01:27:17,165 --> 01:27:19,190
Good heavens! Doesn't it make
any difference to you that I'm going?

1164
01:27:19,367 --> 01:27:21,597
Of course! Will you be gone long?

1165
01:27:22,370 --> 01:27:24,099
I've made no plans
at all for coming back.

1166
01:27:24,272 --> 01:27:26,103
Well, that does sound like a long trip!

1167
01:27:26,441 --> 01:27:29,035
Will you be traveling all the time,
or will you be staying in one place?

1168
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:31,201
- I think it would be just lovely if...
- Lucy!

1169
01:27:31,579 --> 01:27:33,513
I can't stand this any longer!

1170
01:27:34,115 --> 01:27:35,480
I can't stand this!

1171
01:27:37,685 --> 01:27:39,277
I'm just about to walk into
this drugstore here...

1172
01:27:39,487 --> 01:27:42,581
and ask the clerk to give me something
to stop me from dying in my tracks.

1173
01:27:43,358 --> 01:27:44,825
It's quite a shock!

1174
01:27:45,326 --> 01:27:46,588
What is?

1175
01:27:46,761 --> 01:27:48,752
To see how much you've cared
for me.

1176
01:27:48,930 --> 01:27:51,023
To see how much of a difference
this makes to you!

1177
01:27:52,667 --> 01:27:57,366
George! Surely you don't want me
to do pathos on a downtown corner?

1178
01:28:01,142 --> 01:28:03,076
I can't stand this any longer!

1179
01:28:05,313 --> 01:28:06,507
Good-bye, Lucy.

1180
01:28:08,216 --> 01:28:09,547
It is good-bye.

1181
01:28:10,285 --> 01:28:11,946
I think it's good-bye for good!

1182
01:28:12,587 --> 01:28:16,045
Good-bye. I hope you'll have
the most splendid trip.

1183
01:28:16,257 --> 01:28:17,690
Give my love to your mother.

1184
01:28:35,643 --> 01:28:38,874
Please, let me have a few drops
of aromatic spirits of ammonia...

1185
01:28:39,080 --> 01:28:41,571
- in a glass of water.
- Yes ma'am.

1186
01:28:47,355 --> 01:28:49,220
- Look out!
- God, are you sick, miss?

1187
01:28:49,557 --> 01:28:50,922
- Are you all right?
- Lucy!

1188
01:28:54,062 --> 01:28:57,225
The Major had one painful
satisfaction this spring.

1189
01:28:57,398 --> 01:28:58,922
He had his taxes lowered!

1190
01:28:59,100 --> 01:29:00,499
How did he manage that?

1191
01:29:00,702 --> 01:29:03,398
I said it was
a painful satisfaction, Fanny.

1192
01:29:03,604 --> 01:29:06,198
The property has gone down
in value...

1193
01:29:06,407 --> 01:29:09,205
and they assessed it
lower than they did 15 years ago.

1194
01:29:09,410 --> 01:29:10,741
But further out I hear they...

1195
01:29:10,978 --> 01:29:13,276
Oh yes, prices are
magnificent further out.

1196
01:29:13,514 --> 01:29:16,608
We just happen to be the wrong spot.
That's all.

1197
01:29:17,452 --> 01:29:19,545
Not that I don't think
something could be done...

1198
01:29:19,754 --> 01:29:23,417
if father would let me
have a hand. But he won't.

1199
01:29:24,192 --> 01:29:27,787
He's always done
his own figuring, he says.

1200
01:29:28,262 --> 01:29:31,789
And its his life-long habit
to keep his affairs and just...

1201
01:29:31,999 --> 01:29:33,694
hand us out the money.

1202
01:29:34,335 --> 01:29:37,202
Heaven knows!
He's done enough of that.

1203
01:29:37,372 --> 01:29:41,502
It does seem as if there's a great deal
of money to be made nowadays.

1204
01:29:41,709 --> 01:29:44,678
I ran into Frank Rohnson
the other day and he told me...

1205
01:29:44,912 --> 01:29:46,777
Even dear old
Frank has got the fever!

1206
01:29:46,981 --> 01:29:48,141
- Yes, and he told me...
- He told me about...

1207
01:29:48,216 --> 01:29:50,150
this invention he's going into.

1208
01:29:50,385 --> 01:29:53,445
Some new electric headlight...

1209
01:29:53,654 --> 01:29:56,851
- Yes, electric headlights, that's right.
- Headlights better than anything yet...

1210
01:29:57,091 --> 01:29:58,456
Yes, he was telling me about it,
yes.

1211
01:29:58,693 --> 01:30:01,719
He's putting half
he's laid by into it.

1212
01:30:01,929 --> 01:30:03,590
- Half?
- Half.

1213
01:30:04,232 --> 01:30:08,328
And he's almost talked me into
getting father to finance me enough...

1214
01:30:08,536 --> 01:30:11,027
for me to go into it.

1215
01:30:11,272 --> 01:30:14,070
At any rate,
I've been thinking it over.

1216
01:30:14,275 --> 01:30:15,435
So have I!

1217
01:30:16,010 --> 01:30:20,003
He seemed to be certain it would pay
25% in its' first year.

1218
01:30:20,214 --> 01:30:22,876
And I'm only making four
on my little principal.

1219
01:30:23,084 --> 01:30:25,575
It does seem as if enormous
fortunes are being made...

1220
01:30:25,820 --> 01:30:28,152
out of anything to do
with motorcars these days.

1221
01:30:28,356 --> 01:30:31,883
So, I told him I would
think it over seriously.

1222
01:30:32,493 --> 01:30:35,519
- Seriously?
- Seriously.

1223
01:30:36,164 --> 01:30:38,064
- Really?
- Yes.

1224
01:30:39,167 --> 01:30:43,001
You must be careful to leave
yourself a margin of safety, Fanny.

1225
01:30:43,871 --> 01:30:47,932
Now I'm confident that this is a pretty
conservative investment of its' kind.

1226
01:30:48,176 --> 01:30:51,441
And all the chances are with us.
But it is prudent...

1227
01:30:51,746 --> 01:30:54,180
to leave yourself enough
to fall back on.

1228
01:30:54,348 --> 01:30:56,145
In case anything should go wrong.

1229
01:30:56,451 --> 01:31:00,717
- Nothing will go wrong.
- We seem to be partners all right.

1230
01:31:00,922 --> 01:31:05,018
Now let's go and be millionaires before
Isabel and young George come home.

1231
01:31:05,226 --> 01:31:07,353
Well, if they ever do come home!

1232
01:31:10,798 --> 01:31:11,890
Fanny.

1233
01:31:14,001 --> 01:31:16,026
- Thank you.
- My pleasure.

1234
01:31:17,772 --> 01:31:20,263
My dearest George,
thrilled by your news!

1235
01:31:20,508 --> 01:31:22,203
I'm so looking forward to your visit!

1236
01:31:22,543 --> 01:31:26,673
Dear, dear Fanny, we are
so happy to have George with us.

1237
01:31:27,081 --> 01:31:30,608
Dear Father! What fun to be
in Venice with Uncle George.

1238
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:32,115
I wish you were here with us.

1239
01:31:33,020 --> 01:31:34,749
I trust this finds you well.

1240
01:31:36,457 --> 01:31:38,482
I miss you. Isabel.

1241
01:31:38,993 --> 01:31:43,555
Dear Frank Rohnson, we have offered
prayers here today for father's health.

1242
01:31:43,798 --> 01:31:48,064
Fanny, my dearest! How we all
wished you had been here with us.

1243
01:31:48,302 --> 01:31:50,998
I shall be so sad to see George go.

1244
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,240
Well, he seems to have recovered.

1245
01:31:58,012 --> 01:31:59,240
I beg your pardon!

1246
01:31:59,447 --> 01:32:03,383
Your grandson! He was inclined
to melancholy on certain days...

1247
01:32:03,618 --> 01:32:05,313
but he seemed jolly
enough when we parted.

1248
01:32:05,520 --> 01:32:07,511
What was he melancholy about?

1249
01:32:07,722 --> 01:32:10,384
Not getting remorseful about
all the money he's spent in Europe?

1250
01:32:12,026 --> 01:32:13,926
I wonder what he thinks I'm made of.

1251
01:32:14,161 --> 01:32:17,756
Gold! And he's right
about part of you, father!

1252
01:32:17,999 --> 01:32:20,763
- What part is that?
- Your heart.

1253
01:32:21,269 --> 01:32:24,761
I suppose that accounts for how heavy
it feels sometimes nowadays.

1254
01:32:26,474 --> 01:32:29,773
This town is rolling right over
that old mansion, George.

1255
01:32:30,645 --> 01:32:33,079
Rolling right over it
and burying it under...

1256
01:32:33,281 --> 01:32:35,511
Never mind, father!
Don't think of it!

1257
01:32:36,117 --> 01:32:40,451
Lf things are a nuisance, it's a good idea
not to keep remembering them.

1258
01:32:40,988 --> 01:32:42,080
I try not to.

1259
01:32:42,990 --> 01:32:47,051
I try to keep remembering that I won't
be remembering anything very long.

1260
01:32:50,565 --> 01:32:52,624
Not so very long now, my boy.

1261
01:32:54,936 --> 01:32:56,563
Not so very long.

1262
01:33:20,127 --> 01:33:22,061
Has this been a good holiday
for you, dear?

1263
01:33:22,296 --> 01:33:24,355
Oh, I suppose so, why?

1264
01:33:25,433 --> 01:33:29,335
Lt's pleasant for people my age to know
that people your age see they're happy.

1265
01:33:30,671 --> 01:33:32,229
People your age?

1266
01:33:32,974 --> 01:33:35,943
You know, you don't precisely
look like an old woman, mother.

1267
01:33:36,344 --> 01:33:37,311
No?

1268
01:33:38,346 --> 01:33:40,837
But I suppose I feel about
the same as you do inside.

1269
01:33:42,483 --> 01:33:44,212
But time really does fly.

1270
01:33:45,219 --> 01:33:47,653
Perhaps it's more like
the smoke and sky.

1271
01:33:48,122 --> 01:33:51,421
What do you mean?
Time being like the smoke and sky.

1272
01:33:53,094 --> 01:33:56,655
I mean the things that we have
and we think are solid are like smoke.

1273
01:33:57,465 --> 01:34:00,332
And time is like the sky
the smoke disappears into.

1274
01:34:03,704 --> 01:34:06,696
You know, how really the smoke curls up
from the chimney, it seems all thick...

1275
01:34:06,974 --> 01:34:11,104
and black, busy against the skies as if
it would go on and do important things.

1276
01:34:12,246 --> 01:34:14,339
And then you see it
getting thinner and thinner.

1277
01:34:15,149 --> 01:34:17,617
And then in such a little while
it isn't there at all.

1278
01:34:18,753 --> 01:34:23,656
Nothing is there but the sky and the sky
just keeps on being the same forever.

1279
01:34:36,671 --> 01:34:39,333
I don't see much resemblance
between time and the sky...

1280
01:34:40,274 --> 01:34:43,334
but I do see why you like
Lucy Morgan so much.

1281
01:34:44,712 --> 01:34:46,839
You two talk the same wistful,
moony way sometimes.

1282
01:34:47,081 --> 01:34:48,275
We do?

1283
01:34:49,583 --> 01:34:53,781
I don't mean to say that I mind it in
either of you, 'cos I like to hear it.

1284
01:34:57,224 --> 01:35:00,625
Anyway, I've got a lot to read
while you romance.

1285
01:35:06,400 --> 01:35:08,231
- Au revoir, Madame.
- Au revoir.

1286
01:35:35,963 --> 01:35:37,590
Welcome back!

1287
01:35:40,267 --> 01:35:44,601
I wonder if history is going on
repeating itself forever.

1288
01:35:44,872 --> 01:35:49,104
It's the Amberson Mansion again, only
it's your father who's built this one.

1289
01:35:50,945 --> 01:35:54,346
Oh, you're pretty refreshingly
out of the smoke up here.

1290
01:35:54,582 --> 01:35:57,483
Yes, until it comes up
and we have to move out farther.

1291
01:35:57,718 --> 01:36:01,484
No, somebody else
will move out farther...

1292
01:36:01,689 --> 01:36:02,917
you'll stay here.

1293
01:36:05,993 --> 01:36:08,985
I found Isabel as well as usual...

1294
01:36:09,230 --> 01:36:13,189
only I'm afraid "as usual"
isn't particularly well.

1295
01:36:14,902 --> 01:36:16,335
What do you mean by that?

1296
01:36:16,804 --> 01:36:20,171
I'm afraid she hasn't been really well
for several years.

1297
01:36:20,441 --> 01:36:22,909
She's rather alarmingly
short of breath.

1298
01:36:23,144 --> 01:36:26,136
For a slender person of course
she makes nothing of it...

1299
01:36:26,413 --> 01:36:29,610
but it seems rather serious to me.

1300
01:36:29,917 --> 01:36:33,785
I told her I thought she ought to
make George let her come home.

1301
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:37,122
Let her? Does she want to?

1302
01:36:37,358 --> 01:36:41,692
Well, she doesn't urge it,
George seems to like the life in Paris.

1303
01:36:41,896 --> 01:36:43,625
He's quite a swell.

1304
01:36:44,098 --> 01:36:48,467
In spite of anything she said,
I know she does want to come.

1305
01:36:48,669 --> 01:36:50,864
She'd like to be with father,
of course...

1306
01:36:51,305 --> 01:36:52,795
I think she's...

1307
01:36:53,340 --> 01:36:56,434
well, she intimated one day
that she feared...

1308
01:36:56,710 --> 01:36:58,268
she wouldn't get to see him again.

1309
01:36:58,579 --> 01:37:02,675
I thought at first she was referring
to his age and feebleness.

1310
01:37:02,983 --> 01:37:07,443
Later it struck me
she was actually thinking of her own...

1311
01:37:07,688 --> 01:37:09,315
state of health.

1312
01:37:12,226 --> 01:37:13,215
I see.

1313
01:37:13,961 --> 01:37:16,191
And you say he won't let her
come home?

1314
01:37:16,463 --> 01:37:20,763
Oh, I don't think he uses force,
he's very gentle with her.

1315
01:37:21,035 --> 01:37:23,902
I doubt if the subject
is mentioned between them.

1316
01:37:26,240 --> 01:37:27,434
And yet...

1317
01:37:27,708 --> 01:37:32,441
knowing my interesting
nephew as you do...

1318
01:37:32,680 --> 01:37:36,548
wouldn't you think that was
about the way to put it?

1319
01:37:37,785 --> 01:37:39,252
Knowing him as I do?

1320
01:37:42,690 --> 01:37:43,816
Yes.

1321
01:37:45,459 --> 01:37:48,155
Yes, I should say that is
about the way to put it.

1322
01:37:50,297 --> 01:37:51,594
She is very sick.

1323
01:38:02,176 --> 01:38:05,441
It seems to me that
you should return to America.

1324
01:38:05,980 --> 01:38:08,141
To be around
the things that she loves.

1325
01:39:09,543 --> 01:39:11,010
It's changed.

1326
01:39:12,646 --> 01:39:14,580
It's so changed.

1327
01:39:15,516 --> 01:39:16,505
You mean the town!

1328
01:39:16,583 --> 01:39:19,245
You mean the old place
has changed, don't you dear?

1329
01:39:20,454 --> 01:39:21,512
Yes.

1330
01:39:21,755 --> 01:39:25,589
It'll change to a happier place
now that you are back in it!

1331
01:39:25,859 --> 01:39:28,885
Oh, dear!
You're going to get well again.

1332
01:39:49,750 --> 01:39:51,741
When are they going to let me
speak to my daughter?

1333
01:39:54,621 --> 01:39:56,555
They told me to stay out of the way
when they carried her in.

1334
01:39:56,824 --> 01:39:58,257
Said it might upset her!

1335
01:40:00,127 --> 01:40:03,858
I wish they'd let me go on in there
and speak to her! She wants to see me!

1336
01:40:04,298 --> 01:40:08,098
You must get something to eat, Georgie.
I know she'd want you to.

1337
01:40:08,402 --> 01:40:10,336
I have things ready in the kitchen.

1338
01:40:10,604 --> 01:40:13,801
I know she'd want me to.
You'd better go on down.

1339
01:40:14,074 --> 01:40:15,769
I don't want anything to eat.

1340
01:40:20,848 --> 01:40:24,409
I never thought this thing that's the
matter with her could be so serious.

1341
01:40:24,685 --> 01:40:26,846
Mr. George will be right down,
Mr. Morgan, sir.

1342
01:40:27,421 --> 01:40:28,615
Thank you, Sam.

1343
01:40:35,095 --> 01:40:39,395
- I've come to see your mother, George.
- I'm sorry. No.

1344
01:40:40,067 --> 01:40:42,797
Not this time, George.
I'm going up to see her.

1345
01:40:43,037 --> 01:40:45,904
The doctor said
she has to be kept quiet.

1346
01:40:46,173 --> 01:40:49,336
- I'll be quiet.
- I don't think you should, Eugene.

1347
01:40:49,610 --> 01:40:51,009
The doctor said she's going to...

1348
01:40:54,982 --> 01:40:56,813
Fanny's right, Eugene.

1349
01:40:59,319 --> 01:41:01,184
Why don't you come back later?

1350
01:41:14,835 --> 01:41:15,995
All right.

1351
01:41:34,088 --> 01:41:35,453
Darling!

1352
01:41:38,492 --> 01:41:42,588
- Did you get something to eat?
- Yes, mother.

1353
01:41:42,896 --> 01:41:44,557
Oh, you need it.

1354
01:41:48,035 --> 01:41:49,263
Yes.

1355
01:41:53,674 --> 01:41:54,641
Are you sure...

1356
01:41:57,044 --> 01:42:00,013
Are you sure you didn't catch cold
coming home?

1357
01:42:02,082 --> 01:42:04,141
- I'm all right.
- Oh, God!

1358
01:42:08,188 --> 01:42:12,557
Oh, that's sweet. It's so sweet.

1359
01:42:13,393 --> 01:42:14,792
What is?

1360
01:42:15,562 --> 01:42:19,362
I get to feel my hand on your cheek.

1361
01:42:20,567 --> 01:42:22,330
I can feel it.

1362
01:42:35,082 --> 01:42:38,483
I wonder if Eugene
or Lucy know we've come home?

1363
01:42:40,187 --> 01:42:41,586
I am sure they do.

1364
01:42:44,725 --> 01:42:46,124
Did he ask about me?

1365
01:42:47,961 --> 01:42:49,519
Yes, he was here.

1366
01:42:50,964 --> 01:42:52,329
Is he gone?

1367
01:42:53,867 --> 01:42:55,266
Yes, he is gone.

1368
01:43:04,344 --> 01:43:06,539
I should like to have seen him...

1369
01:43:07,948 --> 01:43:09,472
just once.

1370
01:46:27,080 --> 01:46:30,379
I feel that old familiar
sinking feeling...

1371
01:46:30,684 --> 01:46:34,984
that's attended all my previous efforts
to prove myself a business genius!

1372
01:46:35,288 --> 01:46:38,280
Well, it looked so right. We saw
how perfectly nicely they worked.

1373
01:46:38,592 --> 01:46:42,790
Yes, it was perfect. In the shop!
The only thing we didn't know...

1374
01:46:42,863 --> 01:46:45,923
was how fast an automobile
has to go to keep the light going.

1375
01:46:45,999 --> 01:46:48,092
I don't understand, just how fast
does it have to go?

1376
01:46:48,402 --> 01:46:51,633
Lt is computed, by those enthusiasts
who bought our product...

1377
01:46:51,905 --> 01:46:54,499
and subsequently returned it to us
and got their money back.

1378
01:46:54,841 --> 01:46:59,835
That people have to go 50 miles an hour
and above to have a real headlight.

1379
01:47:00,180 --> 01:47:02,774
Unfortunately,
many people don't care...

1380
01:47:02,983 --> 01:47:06,146
to drive that fast, at all times,
after dusk...

1381
01:47:06,486 --> 01:47:09,922
- and especially in traffic!
- But isn't that man going to remedy it?

1382
01:47:10,223 --> 01:47:13,283
- Can't he at least try?
- Yes, he can try, he is trying!

1383
01:47:13,627 --> 01:47:17,393
I'm standing in the office
while he is trying.

1384
01:47:19,466 --> 01:47:22,799
George, you startled me!

1385
01:47:23,537 --> 01:47:25,505
I can hear you walking up and down
in your room.

1386
01:47:25,772 --> 01:47:27,740
You're at it almost every night.

1387
01:47:28,074 --> 01:47:30,099
I know your mother
would want you to rest.

1388
01:47:30,977 --> 01:47:33,912
I wanted to tell you once more,
that what I did was right.

1389
01:47:34,781 --> 01:47:36,681
- About what?
- About everything!

1390
01:47:37,217 --> 01:47:41,017
I think she was happy in her life,
and it is my only consolation.

1391
01:47:42,122 --> 01:47:43,885
She had a good husband...

1392
01:47:44,157 --> 01:47:46,990
and all the comforts and luxuries
that anybody could have had.

1393
01:47:48,862 --> 01:47:50,489
Do you deny that what I did
was right?

1394
01:47:52,933 --> 01:47:56,960
I don't intend to judge, Georgie,
I know you think what you did was right.

1395
01:47:57,270 --> 01:47:59,101
What else was I to do?

1396
01:47:59,506 --> 01:48:01,997
How else could I protect her
from the talk?

1397
01:48:02,309 --> 01:48:04,004
Lt would've died out before long.

1398
01:48:04,311 --> 01:48:08,372
If I hadn't acted as I had,
that slanderous old Mrs. Johnson...

1399
01:48:08,682 --> 01:48:10,411
would still be slandering
my mother today!

1400
01:48:10,717 --> 01:48:13,345
- No, no, no... she's dead.
- Ok.

1401
01:48:13,620 --> 01:48:17,112
- One of the others, they would have!
- No, things are so changed, Georgie.

1402
01:48:17,424 --> 01:48:20,325
Other people... one hardly knows
what's become of them.

1403
01:48:20,627 --> 01:48:21,855
You mean to tell me...

1404
01:48:22,629 --> 01:48:25,757
that if I'd just let things go on,
it would all have turned out fine?

1405
01:48:26,566 --> 01:48:29,694
- I'm not saying so.
- You're afraid to!

1406
01:48:31,471 --> 01:48:34,167
Lt's not all my responsibility!

1407
01:48:34,741 --> 01:48:37,608
Lf you were so sure
that you were wiser than I...

1408
01:48:37,944 --> 01:48:39,468
you could've stopped it!

1409
01:48:43,283 --> 01:48:47,481
No, Georgie!
No one could've stopped you.

1410
01:48:49,189 --> 01:48:52,420
You were too strong and...

1411
01:48:52,692 --> 01:48:53,989
And what?

1412
01:48:56,263 --> 01:48:58,288
And she loved you too well.

1413
01:49:32,232 --> 01:49:34,063
It must be in the sun.

1414
01:49:37,537 --> 01:49:40,301
There wasn't anything here but
the sun in the first place.

1415
01:49:42,809 --> 01:49:44,640
The earth came out of the sun...

1416
01:49:45,879 --> 01:49:47,813
and we came out of the earth.

1417
01:49:49,416 --> 01:49:51,509
So, whatever we are...

1418
01:49:52,953 --> 01:49:55,148
it must have been in the sun.

1419
01:49:58,291 --> 01:50:01,021
We go back to the earth
that we came out of.

1420
01:50:03,063 --> 01:50:06,157
The earth will back
to the sun that it came out of.

1421
01:50:09,002 --> 01:50:10,833
Time means nothing.

1422
01:50:13,306 --> 01:50:15,069
Nothing at all.

1423
01:50:17,077 --> 01:50:18,942
So, in a little while...

1424
01:50:21,748 --> 01:50:23,545
we will all be back in the sun...

1425
01:50:25,385 --> 01:50:26,909
together.

1426
01:50:33,193 --> 01:50:34,626
I wish...

1427
01:50:37,530 --> 01:50:39,157
I wish...

1428
01:50:40,300 --> 01:50:42,234
Did you want anything, grandfather?

1429
01:50:45,739 --> 01:50:46,967
What?

1430
01:50:49,542 --> 01:50:51,737
Would you like a glass of water?

1431
01:50:54,881 --> 01:50:59,284
No, no I don't want anything.

1432
01:51:04,724 --> 01:51:06,157
I wish...

1433
01:51:07,527 --> 01:51:09,825
somebody could tell me.

1434
01:51:17,070 --> 01:51:21,769
This is the Last Will and Testament
of Major George Amberson.

1435
01:51:27,847 --> 01:51:32,682
"I, Major George Amberson,
being of sound mind and body...

1436
01:51:33,119 --> 01:51:35,986
do hereby declare,
as I am a gentleman...

1437
01:51:36,489 --> 01:51:40,186
that the following expresses
my true desire and sincere wish...

1438
01:51:40,527 --> 01:51:43,496
for those of my family
as named herein.

1439
01:51:44,764 --> 01:51:48,723
And also I hereby bequeath those items
as mention hereafter...

1440
01:51:49,335 --> 01:51:54,363
the said items being rightfully
due from myself, George Amberson".

1441
01:52:02,148 --> 01:52:06,414
So much for the great Amberson estate!

1442
01:52:07,554 --> 01:52:09,044
I guessed it!

1443
01:52:09,823 --> 01:52:12,291
As an expert on prosperity...

1444
01:52:12,592 --> 01:52:14,924
my career is disreputable.

1445
01:52:15,295 --> 01:52:17,957
But, as a prophet of calamity...

1446
01:52:18,398 --> 01:52:21,765
I deserve a testimonial banquet!

1447
01:52:26,639 --> 01:52:30,803
We'll survive, Georgie!
You will especially.

1448
01:52:31,711 --> 01:52:38,207
I'm too old and accustomed to falling
back on somebody else to survive...

1449
01:52:38,518 --> 01:52:40,748
to start a big fight with life.

1450
01:52:41,821 --> 01:52:45,279
But an ex-Congressman
can always be pretty sure...

1451
01:52:45,425 --> 01:52:47,655
of getting a Consul-ship.

1452
01:52:48,394 --> 01:52:50,157
I'll live pleasantly enough.

1453
01:52:50,497 --> 01:52:54,024
A pitcher of ice under a Palm tree.

1454
01:52:56,035 --> 01:53:00,495
And I'll manage to send you
fifty dollars every now and then.

1455
01:53:38,211 --> 01:53:41,772
Yes, I can appreciate that they are all
fine objects, but I am afraid that...

1456
01:53:44,951 --> 01:53:47,545
- You understand, right?
- Yes, I do.

1457
01:53:48,521 --> 01:53:49,954
Just sign here.

1458
01:53:55,728 --> 01:53:56,922
Right this way.

1459
01:54:41,107 --> 01:54:44,736
Mother?
Forgive me.

1460
01:54:53,186 --> 01:54:54,619
Forgive me.

1461
01:55:03,596 --> 01:55:07,327
There was this bad Indian chief
that lived in a grove.

1462
01:55:07,700 --> 01:55:09,895
He was the worst Indian
that ever lived.

1463
01:55:10,203 --> 01:55:15,163
And, his name was, it was Vendona.
It means "writes down everything".

1464
01:55:15,742 --> 01:55:16,902
I see.

1465
01:55:17,543 --> 01:55:20,910
Vendona was so proud,
he wore iron shoes.

1466
01:55:21,247 --> 01:55:23,875
He walked over people's faces
with them.

1467
01:55:24,217 --> 01:55:27,209
At last, the tribe decided that it wasn't
a good enough excuse for him...

1468
01:55:27,553 --> 01:55:30,181
that he was young and inexperienced.
He had to go!

1469
01:55:30,990 --> 01:55:34,653
So, they brought him down to the river
and they put him in a canoe...

1470
01:55:34,994 --> 01:55:38,930
and they pushed him off from
the shore and he never come back.

1471
01:55:39,966 --> 01:55:42,935
- So, Georgie, I mean, the chief...
- Vendona.

1472
01:55:43,303 --> 01:55:45,362
No, they didn't want him back,
of course...

1473
01:55:45,705 --> 01:55:48,105
the tribe had lived such
an exciting life under Vendona...

1474
01:55:48,474 --> 01:55:52,535
they wouldn't settle down to anything
tame. Couldn't help feeling that way.

1475
01:55:52,679 --> 01:55:57,480
Well, I see, so that's why they named
the place "They couldn't help it".

1476
01:55:58,518 --> 01:56:00,110
It must've been.

1477
01:56:02,188 --> 01:56:04,281
So you are going to stay here
in your garden...

1478
01:56:05,224 --> 01:56:09,661
growing to look like a penciled
garden lady in a Victorian engraving.

1479
01:56:10,863 --> 01:56:12,990
I suppose I'm like the tribe.

1480
01:56:13,366 --> 01:56:15,857
I had too much unpleasant excitement.

1481
01:56:16,202 --> 01:56:19,399
It was unpleasant,
but it was excitement.

1482
01:56:20,640 --> 01:56:22,767
And I don't want any more.

1483
01:56:23,209 --> 01:56:25,939
In fact,
I don't want anything but you.

1484
01:56:27,280 --> 01:56:29,373
What was the name of the grove?

1485
01:56:30,516 --> 01:56:34,452
- "They couldn't help it".
- No, the Indian name.

1486
01:56:35,521 --> 01:56:37,250
Mo-wa-ha-ha.

1487
01:56:40,193 --> 01:56:43,822
- That wasn't a native sound.
- I've forgotten.

1488
01:56:46,532 --> 01:56:48,966
Well, perhaps you can remember
the Chief's name better?

1489
01:56:50,036 --> 01:56:51,628
I don't.

1490
01:56:58,311 --> 01:57:00,973
I hope someday you can forget.

1491
01:57:11,157 --> 01:57:12,556
Porter!

1492
01:57:15,261 --> 01:57:17,456
I may not see you again, George.

1493
01:57:18,064 --> 01:57:20,931
It's an odd way for us
to be saying good-bye.

1494
01:57:21,501 --> 01:57:24,561
One wouldn't have thought it,
but here we are...

1495
01:57:24,904 --> 01:57:29,238
two gentlemen of elegant appearance
in a state of prostitute.

1496
01:57:34,080 --> 01:57:36,708
We can't ever tell
what will happen at all, can we?

1497
01:57:36,949 --> 01:57:41,181
- Please, take my dog.
- Once I stood where we're standing now...

1498
01:57:41,487 --> 01:57:43,614
to say good-bye to a pretty girl...

1499
01:57:43,689 --> 01:57:46,852
only it was in the old station,
before this one was built.

1500
01:57:47,326 --> 01:57:49,191
They called it the "Deepo".

1501
01:57:49,762 --> 01:57:53,357
I was wild about her
and we were to be married.

1502
01:57:53,866 --> 01:57:58,530
She had to go abroad first, and when
we came to say good-bye to each other...

1503
01:57:58,671 --> 01:58:02,607
we knew we wouldn't see
each other again for almost a year.

1504
01:58:04,310 --> 01:58:06,471
I thought
I couldn't live through it.

1505
01:58:08,448 --> 01:58:11,884
I don't even know where
she lives now, or if she is living.

1506
01:58:12,652 --> 01:58:15,348
If she ever thinks of me,
she probably imagines I'm still...

1507
01:58:15,922 --> 01:58:19,983
dancing in the ballroom
at Amberson Mansion.

1508
01:58:20,359 --> 01:58:21,883
Whisky, twice.

1509
01:58:23,062 --> 01:58:25,553
Life and money.

1510
01:58:26,099 --> 01:58:29,535
Both behave like loose quick-sliver
in a nest of cracks.

1511
01:58:30,203 --> 01:58:33,036
And when they are gone
you can't tell where...

1512
01:58:33,139 --> 01:58:35,664
or what the devil you did
with them.

1513
01:58:39,745 --> 01:58:43,579
I believe what I'll say now.
I've always been fond of you, Georgie...

1514
01:58:46,052 --> 01:58:48,418
but I can't say
I've always liked you.

1515
01:58:49,822 --> 01:58:54,122
But you've received a pretty heavy jolt
and you've taken it pretty quietly...

1516
01:58:54,193 --> 01:58:57,424
- and I...
- All the passengers to Washington...

1517
01:58:57,497 --> 01:59:00,694
With my train coming into the shed,
you'll forgive me for saying...

1518
01:59:01,100 --> 01:59:04,536
there have been times when
I thought you ought to be hanged.

1519
01:59:04,904 --> 01:59:06,132
On plaftorm two...

1520
01:59:06,506 --> 01:59:08,667
- Washington D.C.
- But I've always been fond of you.

1521
01:59:10,443 --> 01:59:11,569
And now...

1522
01:59:12,712 --> 01:59:14,839
I like you.

1523
01:59:16,983 --> 01:59:21,750
Just for a last word. There is someone
who's always felt about you that way.

1524
01:59:21,821 --> 01:59:23,186
Found of you, I mean.

1525
01:59:23,523 --> 01:59:24,854
- You might try to...
- All aboard.

1526
01:59:25,725 --> 01:59:28,626
- Well, I must run.
- All aboard.

1527
01:59:36,502 --> 01:59:39,164
All aboard!
Ladies and gentlemen...

1528
01:59:40,139 --> 01:59:43,302
this is the last call!
All aboard!

1529
01:59:44,377 --> 01:59:46,709
I'll send back the money
as fast as they pay me.

1530
01:59:47,747 --> 01:59:48,839
So...

1531
01:59:50,016 --> 01:59:51,506
good-bye!

1532
01:59:55,254 --> 01:59:57,313
God bless you, Georgie.

1533
02:00:20,713 --> 02:00:23,807
By this time tomorrow
we'll be in our new home, Georgie.

1534
02:00:23,983 --> 02:00:26,042
I'll make a nice home for you.

1535
02:00:26,152 --> 02:00:28,712
Even out of a three-roomed
kitchenette apartment.

1536
02:00:28,955 --> 02:00:30,354
You'll see!

1537
02:00:32,658 --> 02:00:36,754
Lt'll be good to be among nice people,
people who know who we are.

1538
02:00:38,864 --> 02:00:41,298
It's about this new apartment
that I wanted to speak.

1539
02:00:43,102 --> 02:00:44,330
What?

1540
02:00:46,906 --> 02:00:49,170
I'm sure it's
just what you like, but...

1541
02:00:52,645 --> 02:00:54,909
I've decided on another arrangement
for myself.

1542
02:00:57,116 --> 02:01:00,347
- You're going to leave me in the lurch!
- Get up, Aunt Fan.

1543
02:01:00,453 --> 02:01:05,015
I can't! I'm too weak!
You're going to leave me in the lurch!

1544
02:01:05,124 --> 02:01:08,890
For heaven's sake, get up! Stop sitting
with your back against the stove.

1545
02:01:08,995 --> 02:01:13,591
No, it's not hot, it's cold...
we ran out of coal a long time ago.

1546
02:01:13,699 --> 02:01:15,496
I wouldn't mind if it was hot...

1547
02:01:15,601 --> 02:01:17,728
- I wouldn't mind if it had burned me...
- For heaven's sake.

1548
02:01:17,870 --> 02:01:21,169
- Get up, come on!
- No! No!

1549
02:01:21,540 --> 02:01:25,636
I'd be a burden on you.
I'm to get eight dollars a week.

1550
02:01:25,745 --> 02:01:27,508
You'd be paying more
of the expenses than I would.

1551
02:01:27,647 --> 02:01:31,105
I'd be paying, I'd be paying,
I'd be paying.

1552
02:01:31,250 --> 02:01:33,047
Exactly! You'd be,
you certainly would!

1553
02:01:33,252 --> 02:01:37,382
- But you'd be using more of your money.
- Money? I've got 28 dollars!

1554
02:01:37,523 --> 02:01:38,683
That is all!

1555
02:01:38,791 --> 02:01:40,816
Until the interest is due.

1556
02:01:40,926 --> 02:01:45,090
And no, there's no interest 'cos
there's no more principal.

1557
02:01:47,366 --> 02:01:50,494
But, but, Uncle George
said you had more money!

1558
02:01:51,070 --> 02:01:54,005
Uncle George said you had
enough money to fall back on!

1559
02:01:54,206 --> 02:01:56,970
He said you'd bought some stocks
you shouldn't have but that's all...

1560
02:01:57,109 --> 02:02:01,068
I lost it all! I lost it all!
Lt seemed a sure way...

1561
02:02:01,180 --> 02:02:04,946
of making a fortune out of
a little bit of money.

1562
02:02:05,084 --> 02:02:07,382
Good Lord! Did you have
to wait until now to tell me?

1563
02:02:07,720 --> 02:02:10,712
I couldn't tell it until I had to!

1564
02:02:10,856 --> 02:02:13,324
Lt wouldn't have done any good.

1565
02:02:13,459 --> 02:02:16,519
Nothing does any good
in this old world.

1566
02:02:16,662 --> 02:02:19,597
I can't. I tried, I tried.

1567
02:02:19,699 --> 02:02:22,964
I was trying to look
for a place for us to live.

1568
02:02:23,102 --> 02:02:26,902
I knew you didn't want me!
I knew it!

1569
02:02:27,206 --> 02:02:31,142
And what of you, you shouldn't
be left alone in this world...

1570
02:02:31,243 --> 02:02:35,771
I knew your mother would
want you to be looked after...

1571
02:02:35,948 --> 02:02:37,916
and have a home.

1572
02:02:40,419 --> 02:02:45,516
I walked my heels down looking
for a place for us to live.

1573
02:02:45,658 --> 02:02:49,321
I didn't...
I walked and walked all over this town.

1574
02:02:49,428 --> 02:02:53,762
I wouldn't take a streetcar,
no matter how tired I got.

1575
02:02:54,100 --> 02:02:57,558
Because I didn't want to spend...

1576
02:02:57,870 --> 02:03:01,033
and now,
you want to leave me...

1577
02:03:01,173 --> 02:03:03,869
in the lurch.

1578
02:03:04,543 --> 02:03:07,944
You want to leave me in the lurch.

1579
02:03:50,356 --> 02:03:52,449
Sr. Minafer to see you, sir.

1580
02:03:53,559 --> 02:03:56,926
George! The real flair!

1581
02:03:57,062 --> 02:03:59,087
The real flair for the law.

1582
02:03:59,732 --> 02:04:00,892
That's right!

1583
02:04:01,267 --> 02:04:03,531
Couldn't wait till tomorrow
to begin, eh!

1584
02:04:03,636 --> 02:04:04,796
I'm delighted that...

1585
02:04:04,937 --> 02:04:07,838
- I wanted to say...
- Wait just a minute, young man.

1586
02:04:08,507 --> 02:04:13,444
I've prepared a little speech
of welcome, and, I mean to deliver it.

1587
02:04:13,579 --> 02:04:18,312
I think you'll find an honest pleasure
in our industry and frugality.

1588
02:04:19,985 --> 02:04:24,285
- The law is a jealous mistress, but...
- I can't do it.

1589
02:04:24,423 --> 02:04:25,390
What?

1590
02:04:25,558 --> 02:04:27,583
I can't take her for my mistress.

1591
02:04:29,662 --> 02:04:32,756
I've come to tell you, I have to
find something quicker.

1592
02:04:33,833 --> 02:04:36,597
I have to find something
that pays from the start.

1593
02:04:37,503 --> 02:04:39,801
Well, sit down, my boy.

1594
02:04:40,940 --> 02:04:44,501
- What's the trouble?
- Well, you see sir, it's Aunt Fanny.

1595
02:04:45,544 --> 02:04:47,739
She has her heart
set on this apartment.

1596
02:04:47,880 --> 02:04:50,041
She's got some old cronies there
and...

1597
02:04:50,115 --> 02:04:52,515
I guess she's been looking for
the games of bridge.

1598
02:04:52,718 --> 02:04:54,447
But she has her own resources.

1599
02:04:54,587 --> 02:04:57,988
No! Lt all went
into the headlight company.

1600
02:05:00,025 --> 02:05:03,756
I got her into that.
I feel a certain responsibility

1601
02:05:03,896 --> 02:05:05,591
I'm taking the responsibility.

1602
02:05:06,365 --> 02:05:09,027
She's not your Aunt, you know!
Sir!

1603
02:05:09,635 --> 02:05:12,695
I'm unable to see that
a young man is morally called upon...

1604
02:05:12,771 --> 02:05:14,363
to give up a career in the law...

1605
02:05:14,540 --> 02:05:18,977
to provide his Aunt with a favorable
opportunity to play bridge!

1606
02:05:20,212 --> 02:05:21,611
I feel as if...

1607
02:05:24,149 --> 02:05:25,707
I feel as if...

1608
02:05:26,785 --> 02:05:30,744
I have one or two pretty important
things in my life to make up for.

1609
02:05:31,957 --> 02:05:36,189
Well, I can't!
I can't make them up to...

1610
02:05:37,196 --> 02:05:38,629
to whom I would.

1611
02:05:39,598 --> 02:05:44,058
So it struck me that I might be decent
to somebody else... perhaps...

1612
02:05:44,270 --> 02:05:46,135
so that's what I've come
to see you about.

1613
02:05:47,540 --> 02:05:49,303
I have an idea, you see!

1614
02:05:49,542 --> 02:05:51,601
Well, I'm glad of that!

1615
02:05:51,710 --> 02:05:56,079
I can't think of anything, just at
the minute, that pays, from the start.

1616
02:05:56,682 --> 02:06:00,118
I suppose that I am about as ignorant
of business as anybody in the world...

1617
02:06:00,619 --> 02:06:04,646
but I've heard they pay very high wages
to people who work in dangerous trades.

1618
02:06:04,857 --> 02:06:07,792
People who handle touchy chemicals
or high explosives.

1619
02:06:08,894 --> 02:06:11,863
I thought I'd see if I couldn't
find something of the kind to do.

1620
02:06:12,331 --> 02:06:13,798
As soon as possible!

1621
02:06:16,802 --> 02:06:17,860
All right!

1622
02:06:19,471 --> 02:06:21,496
You promise not to get blown up...

1623
02:06:22,341 --> 02:06:25,037
and I'll go with you to see
if we can find the job!

1624
02:06:34,653 --> 02:06:35,881
There you go, George.

1625
02:06:36,589 --> 02:06:38,819
- Good morning, Sr. Averson.
- Good morning.

1626
02:06:38,958 --> 02:06:40,448
- How are you?
- Fine!

1627
02:06:42,194 --> 02:06:44,458
Are you all right, Georgie?
You seem a little down.

1628
02:06:45,164 --> 02:06:46,392
- I'm fine.
- Excuse me.

1629
02:06:46,565 --> 02:06:48,089
- Really? Are you sure?
- Can I join you?

1630
02:06:48,233 --> 02:06:49,757
You seem a little down.

1631
02:06:50,603 --> 02:06:52,036
Do you want some cream?

1632
02:07:13,192 --> 02:07:14,682
4th of July reminds me.

1633
02:07:15,427 --> 02:07:17,554
Have you heard what that
George Minafer is doing?

1634
02:07:18,864 --> 02:07:19,831
No, I haven't.

1635
02:07:19,965 --> 02:07:22,832
Well, sir, it beats the devil!
My boy Fred told me about it yesterday.

1636
02:07:23,535 --> 02:07:26,993
Seems young Georgie is working
for the Acres Chemical Company.

1637
02:07:27,940 --> 02:07:31,171
- What does he do?
- He's a nitro-glycerin expert.

1638
02:07:32,745 --> 02:07:33,734
He is what?

1639
02:07:34,313 --> 02:07:35,575
Doesn't that beat the devil?

1640
02:07:36,382 --> 02:07:40,341
Seems to me I heard the average life
in that sort of work is around 4 years!

1641
02:07:40,519 --> 02:07:44,011
Agents can't write any insurance
at all for nitro-glycerin experts.

1642
02:07:44,556 --> 02:07:45,955
No, I suppose not.

1643
02:07:47,426 --> 02:07:51,886
I suppose it would be pass around
the hat for old Fanny, if he blew up.

1644
02:07:52,564 --> 02:07:54,794
They say she hasn't got
anything else to depend on.

1645
02:07:56,368 --> 02:07:57,665
I suppose not.

1646
02:07:58,404 --> 02:08:01,862
I was wondering why you couldn't find
something around your works for him.

1647
02:08:02,007 --> 02:08:05,738
He used to be such a tremendous friend
of the family, I thought perhaps you...

1648
02:08:05,911 --> 02:08:08,106
No, no.
I haven't anything to offer him.

1649
02:08:08,847 --> 02:08:10,644
I don't know that I would myself!

1650
02:08:11,817 --> 02:08:14,445
Well... we'll probably see his name
in the paper some day...

1651
02:08:14,887 --> 02:08:16,787
if he stays with that job.

1652
02:08:35,741 --> 02:08:38,733
Here it is, our Civic History, sir.
The latest version.

1653
02:08:38,877 --> 02:08:40,811
Please let me know
if you need anything else.

1654
02:09:28,160 --> 02:09:31,061
This old town of ours
is really getting enormous.

1655
02:09:34,199 --> 02:09:37,168
I shouldn't mind knowing who he is!

1656
02:09:37,402 --> 02:09:39,029
Well, I don't know who he is...

1657
02:09:39,471 --> 02:09:41,769
but from his looks,
I know who he thinks he is!

1658
02:09:41,940 --> 02:09:44,135
He thinks he's
the Grand Duke Cuthbert.

1659
02:09:48,213 --> 02:09:49,578
Riffraff.

1660
02:10:07,399 --> 02:10:09,833
Lucy? Lucy?

1661
02:10:12,371 --> 02:10:13,736
Lucy?

1662
02:10:14,273 --> 02:10:15,570
- Look out!
- Will you get out of the way!

1663
02:10:15,741 --> 02:10:16,935
Look out!

1664
02:10:18,610 --> 02:10:20,407
- Look out!
- Get out of the way!

1665
02:10:21,013 --> 02:10:23,243
- Look out!
- Oh, God!

1666
02:10:44,670 --> 02:10:46,433
Now, just stay calm.

1667
02:10:49,608 --> 02:10:51,872
- Be careful with him.
- Let's take him to the hospital!

1668
02:10:52,211 --> 02:10:53,303
Now, stay calm.

1669
02:10:53,512 --> 02:10:55,173
Do you want me to take
you to a private hospital?

1670
02:10:55,314 --> 02:10:56,474
No!

1671
02:10:56,582 --> 02:10:57,776
Take him to the city hospital

1672
02:10:59,351 --> 02:11:01,216
Take me to the city hospital.

1673
02:11:03,922 --> 02:11:06,482
He was just standing right
in the middle of the road.

1674
02:11:06,558 --> 02:11:08,958
- That is right! I saw it!
- We all saw it!

1675
02:11:09,561 --> 02:11:11,756
Stand back, stand back.

1676
02:11:12,164 --> 02:11:13,461
Give us some space, please.

1677
02:11:15,067 --> 02:11:17,797
- Stand back.
- He was right in front of us!

1678
02:11:29,681 --> 02:11:32,445
Some would call it progress,
I would call it shame.

1679
02:11:32,618 --> 02:11:35,519
Those darn machines shouldn't be allowed
on the street, as far as I'm concerned.

1680
02:11:42,895 --> 02:11:45,455
Funny what he says to the little cuss
that done the damage.

1681
02:11:46,231 --> 02:11:48,791
That's all he did call him.
Nothing else at all.

1682
02:11:49,801 --> 02:11:52,964
The cuss that broke both his legs
for him and God knows what all.

1683
02:11:53,038 --> 02:11:54,096
What was it?

1684
02:11:56,642 --> 02:11:58,109
"Riffraff".

1685
02:12:00,312 --> 02:12:01,745
What's the prognosis?

1686
02:12:01,914 --> 02:12:04,007
We don't know yet.
It's critical.

1687
02:12:06,685 --> 02:12:08,084
Nurse.

1688
02:12:09,354 --> 02:12:10,753
Do you want something?

1689
02:12:45,157 --> 02:12:47,990
There's nothing
in this family business.

1690
02:12:56,535 --> 02:12:58,230
Even George Washington...

1691
02:13:00,105 --> 02:13:02,266
is only something in a book.

1692
02:13:14,419 --> 02:13:17,286
I'll not go home now, Harry,
drive to the City Hospital.

1693
02:13:18,423 --> 02:13:19,515
Yes, sir.

1694
02:13:23,095 --> 02:13:27,589
Miss Lucy's there. She said she expected
you to come there before you went home.

1695
02:13:30,035 --> 02:13:32,469
- She did?
- Yes, sir.

1696
02:13:34,139 --> 02:13:36,437
I suppose Mr. Minafer
must be pretty bad.

1697
02:13:36,641 --> 02:13:40,077
Yes, I understand he's
liable to get well though, sir.

1698
02:13:46,485 --> 02:13:47,645
Fanny?

1699
02:13:48,653 --> 02:13:50,120
Eugene!

1700
02:13:56,962 --> 02:13:58,020
Where is he?

1701
02:13:58,530 --> 02:14:01,465
He is right here.
I will take you.

1702
02:15:09,901 --> 02:15:12,335
You must have thought my mother
wanted you to come here...

1703
02:15:13,572 --> 02:15:15,870
so that I could ask you
to forgive me.

1704
02:15:19,211 --> 02:15:23,238
No! Just to take your hand.

1705
02:16:24,109 --> 02:16:25,474
Dearest, Isabel...

1706
02:16:27,212 --> 02:16:31,239
Your boy was hurt a few days ago
in a street accident...

1707
02:16:32,984 --> 02:16:35,316
run down by an automobile.

1708
02:16:37,189 --> 02:16:41,091
At first, I thought I wouldn't go
to see him at the hospital, but...

1709
02:16:41,159 --> 02:16:42,091
of course I did.

1710
02:16:44,162 --> 02:16:46,357
I thought it would be
hard not to be bitter...

1711
02:16:48,600 --> 02:16:52,730
but I found it was easy, he looked
so much like you, dearest one.

1712
02:16:55,607 --> 02:16:57,336
As I came in, he said...

1713
02:16:59,044 --> 02:17:03,378
"You must've come because you thought
my mother wanted you...

1714
02:17:05,517 --> 02:17:07,417
to forgive me".

1715
02:17:09,321 --> 02:17:12,017
Lucy sat beside him, radiant.

1716
02:17:14,559 --> 02:17:17,585
But for me, another radiance
filled the room...

1717
02:17:18,964 --> 02:17:21,524
and I knew
that I had been true at last...

1718
02:17:22,067 --> 02:17:23,932
to my true love.

1719
02:17:25,337 --> 02:17:28,738
And that through me you had brought
your boy under shelter again.
