1
00:01:05,890 --> 00:01:07,550
- Would ya look at that folks?

2
00:01:07,550 --> 00:01:09,700
You couldn't ask for more perfect

3
00:01:09,700 --> 00:01:11,740
Christmas weather than this!

4
00:01:11,740 --> 00:01:15,010
Unfortunately, those shots
were taken in Vermont

5
00:01:15,010 --> 00:01:17,510
and you live in California!

6
00:01:17,510 --> 00:01:21,490
Hello, wake up and smell the latte!

7
00:01:21,490 --> 00:01:24,710
Our forecast for the next
five days calls for the usual:

8
00:01:24,710 --> 00:01:27,800
warm, toasty, hot, scorching!

9
00:01:27,800 --> 00:01:29,920
So, I hate to be the
one to break it to you,

10
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:32,430
but there is not a chance of
there being a white Christmas

11
00:01:32,430 --> 00:01:36,170
this year within a hundred
miles of where I'm sittin'.

12
00:01:36,170 --> 00:01:37,080
- No skiing?

13
00:01:37,080 --> 00:01:38,770
- Nope, no snow!

14
00:01:38,770 --> 00:01:40,690
Not a drop, not a flake.

15
00:01:40,690 --> 00:01:42,330
Except for maybe that!

16
00:01:42,330 --> 00:01:43,160
Merry Christmas to you!

17
00:01:43,160 --> 00:01:45,340
- I cannot believe even
you would do this to me!

18
00:01:45,340 --> 00:01:46,910
- Yeah, and I can't believe that this jerk

19
00:01:46,910 --> 00:01:49,390
would ask me for a raise and
he can't even deliver snow!

20
00:01:49,390 --> 00:01:50,620
- Don't change the subject!

21
00:01:50,620 --> 00:01:52,650
Look, I only get two weeks a year,

22
00:01:52,650 --> 00:01:54,170
how can you give them away?

23
00:01:54,170 --> 00:01:55,840
- Mary, I need you.

24
00:01:55,840 --> 00:01:57,660
All right, fine, the station needs you.

25
00:01:57,660 --> 00:02:00,410
You know the Channel 3
motto, three for the people?

26
00:02:00,410 --> 00:02:02,420
Well, Duckworth wants more people stories

27
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:06,430
and nobody does people stories
better than Mary Maloney!

28
00:02:06,430 --> 00:02:08,510
- Yeah, well, I'm a people too,

29
00:02:08,510 --> 00:02:11,400
and I need snow at
Christmas, I need Vermont,

30
00:02:11,400 --> 00:02:13,760
I look forward to it all year!

31
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:16,110
Christmas around here is
all hype and no heart.

32
00:02:17,140 --> 00:02:19,180
- I have all the heart you need.

33
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:20,940
- Get a transplant.

34
00:02:20,940 --> 00:02:23,520
- Mary, the station needs
one of those great, big

35
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,350
Mary Maloney Christmas stories, you know,

36
00:02:24,350 --> 00:02:25,750
the kind that touch you right here!

37
00:02:25,750 --> 00:02:27,540
- I hate making people feel like Christmas

38
00:02:27,540 --> 00:02:30,560
has to be perfect, they
end up feeling hollow

39
00:02:30,560 --> 00:02:32,690
and disappointed, like I do now.

40
00:02:32,690 --> 00:02:34,850
- Mary, you are looking
at this the wrong way,

41
00:02:34,850 --> 00:02:35,690
that's your talent!

42
00:02:35,690 --> 00:02:38,030
See, you can make people
think Christmas is wonderful

43
00:02:38,030 --> 00:02:40,150
even though it is hollow
and disappointing!

44
00:02:40,150 --> 00:02:41,370
Come with me, come with me.

45
00:02:42,640 --> 00:02:44,930
There's a station in St.
Louis that's following

46
00:02:44,930 --> 00:02:47,340
a real family as they
prepare for the holidays,

47
00:02:47,340 --> 00:02:49,130
the audience is eating it up!

48
00:02:49,130 --> 00:02:51,320
That is your ticket, I promise you!

49
00:02:51,320 --> 00:02:53,960
We're gonna find you a family
and you're gonna follow them

50
00:02:53,960 --> 00:02:55,850
as they prepare for Christmas.

51
00:02:55,850 --> 00:02:58,070
We're gonna bring the audience
right into the living room!

52
00:02:58,070 --> 00:02:59,800
- Mac, how long have you been promising

53
00:02:59,800 --> 00:03:01,080
that you'd move me into news?

54
00:03:01,080 --> 00:03:03,420
- And I will, but you
have to be a good sport,

55
00:03:03,420 --> 00:03:05,920
you gotta play by Duckworth's rules.

56
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:09,290
Which reminds me, he
wants you to wear this.

57
00:03:12,550 --> 00:03:15,020
- You know, my contract is up in February

58
00:03:15,020 --> 00:03:17,920
and there is nothing holding
me here except a job in news.

59
00:03:18,960 --> 00:03:20,130
- And, well...

60
00:03:21,820 --> 00:03:23,080
- What does that mean?

61
00:03:23,080 --> 00:03:24,920
- Well, I mean, Mary, you know,

62
00:03:24,920 --> 00:03:26,420
your contract's up every
year and every year

63
00:03:26,420 --> 00:03:28,620
you threaten to quit but you never leave.

64
00:03:28,620 --> 00:03:30,430
I mean, something's
obviously keeping you here

65
00:03:30,430 --> 00:03:33,350
and I have a pretty good
idea I know what it is.

66
00:03:35,380 --> 00:03:39,900
- You are absolutely right, I
have stayed here far too long.

67
00:03:39,900 --> 00:03:41,970
It is time to put my foot down

68
00:03:41,970 --> 00:03:43,870
and I'm putting it down on this story!

69
00:03:44,830 --> 00:03:46,540
- I, I wish you would pick
it up and then put it down

70
00:03:46,540 --> 00:03:48,550
then pick it up again
and put it down again

71
00:03:48,550 --> 00:03:50,270
because you're on in 53 seconds.

72
00:03:53,400 --> 00:03:55,160
- Letters to Santa,

73
00:03:55,160 --> 00:03:57,300
it's like fingernails on a chalkboard!

74
00:03:58,180 --> 00:04:00,790
Dear Santa, can you get me a new life?

75
00:04:00,790 --> 00:04:02,370
- Best idea I ever had!

76
00:04:02,370 --> 00:04:03,210
- No doubt.

77
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,610
- Hey Steve.
- Hello, Mary, 30 seconds!

78
00:04:08,610 --> 00:04:09,840
- Thank you.

79
00:04:09,840 --> 00:04:12,130
Nice legs!
- Hey, Mar.

80
00:04:12,130 --> 00:04:14,420
- Do you have this?
- How are my teeth?

81
00:04:14,420 --> 00:04:15,250
- Good.

82
00:04:15,250 --> 00:04:16,400
You look good.

83
00:04:16,400 --> 00:04:18,150
- [Steve] 15 seconds.

84
00:04:20,930 --> 00:04:21,800
- Hola!

85
00:04:21,800 --> 00:04:23,650
- Got your bags packed?

86
00:04:23,650 --> 00:04:25,200
- There's been a change of plans.

87
00:04:25,200 --> 00:04:26,030
- Oh!

88
00:04:26,030 --> 00:04:27,290
- And five, four
- You must be really

89
00:04:27,290 --> 00:04:30,420
disappointed, I'm so sorry!
- Three, two...

90
00:04:30,420 --> 00:04:32,700
- Well, it's that time of
year again when thousands

91
00:04:32,700 --> 00:04:35,130
of letters to Santa on
the way to the North Pole,

92
00:04:35,130 --> 00:04:37,130
and that means it's time
for lifestyle's reporter

93
00:04:37,130 --> 00:04:40,270
Mary Maloney to help us write
our very own letters to Santa.

94
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:42,800
Mary?

95
00:04:42,800 --> 00:04:46,060
- That's right, time is running
out but there's still time

96
00:04:46,060 --> 00:04:49,010
for you kids of all
ages to write to Santa.

97
00:04:49,010 --> 00:04:51,330
Thousands of letters filled
with Christmas wishes

98
00:04:51,330 --> 00:04:53,870
are already on their way to the North Pole

99
00:04:53,870 --> 00:04:55,500
and we have just a few of them here

100
00:04:55,500 --> 00:04:58,060
on loan to us by the postal service.

101
00:04:58,060 --> 00:05:01,960
So, to write to Santa, all
you need is some paper,

102
00:05:01,960 --> 00:05:03,770
a pen or a pencil, an envelope,

103
00:05:03,770 --> 00:05:06,160
and a lot of hope in your heart.

104
00:05:06,160 --> 00:05:08,000
So, Dan, Rita.

105
00:05:10,630 --> 00:05:11,810
Here it goes.

106
00:05:11,810 --> 00:05:14,860
Dear Santa, what I would
like for Christmas...

107
00:05:14,860 --> 00:05:16,410
- How do you spell Ferrari?

108
00:05:16,410 --> 00:05:18,070
- You haven't been that good, Dan.

109
00:05:18,070 --> 00:05:20,180
- But there's hope in my heart, Rita.

110
00:05:20,180 --> 00:05:24,300
- All right, now you just fold
it, put it in the envelope,

111
00:05:24,300 --> 00:05:27,390
and send to Santa Claus
care of the North Pole.

112
00:05:27,390 --> 00:05:30,240
But I have it on good
authority that if you send it

113
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:32,350
to St. Nicholas, Kris Kringle,

114
00:05:32,350 --> 00:05:35,140
Father Christmas, or just plain Santa,

115
00:05:35,140 --> 00:05:38,150
your letter will reach
the jolly old fellow.

116
00:05:38,150 --> 00:05:40,520
- And Mary, what did you wish for?

117
00:05:40,520 --> 00:05:42,360
- I asked for our entire audience

118
00:05:42,360 --> 00:05:45,560
to have a happy and
healthy holiday season.

119
00:05:45,560 --> 00:05:49,280
And, of course, for all of
these wishes to come true.

120
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:50,630
- [All] Ho ho ho!

121
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:55,880
- Hey, hey, great job,
great job, everybody!

122
00:05:55,880 --> 00:05:57,900
Well done, well done,
well done, well done!

123
00:05:57,900 --> 00:05:59,260
Hey, Rita was too shiny.

124
00:05:59,260 --> 00:06:01,450
Okay, good job, good job, good job.

125
00:06:01,450 --> 00:06:04,420
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey,
you people were beautiful!

126
00:06:04,420 --> 00:06:05,760
Excellent as always, thank you, thank you!

127
00:06:05,760 --> 00:06:09,940
You were all great,
especially my Mary Christmas.

128
00:06:09,940 --> 00:06:12,200
Mary Christmas, isn't that smart, huh?

129
00:06:12,200 --> 00:06:13,030
- What do you need, Mac?

130
00:06:13,030 --> 00:06:14,870
- Well, I had this genius idea.

131
00:06:14,870 --> 00:06:17,050
Why don't we get you story
from there letters right here?

132
00:06:17,050 --> 00:06:18,190
I'm sure it's...
- You can't open that,

133
00:06:18,190 --> 00:06:19,840
that's official mail!
- I'm sure Santa's

134
00:06:19,840 --> 00:06:21,610
not gonna mind, I'm sure
he's not gonna mind,

135
00:06:21,610 --> 00:06:23,020
these are filled with ideas!

136
00:06:23,020 --> 00:06:23,960
Here, we'll grab some, let's see.

137
00:06:23,960 --> 00:06:25,800
"Dear Santa, please bring me a new truck,

138
00:06:25,800 --> 00:06:28,600
"the one I got last year
broke, love, Jared," No.

139
00:06:28,600 --> 00:06:29,550
A-ha!

140
00:06:29,550 --> 00:06:31,550
"Dear Santa, I've been a good person

141
00:06:31,550 --> 00:06:35,320
"except when I bit my sister," No.

142
00:06:35,320 --> 00:06:36,680
Here, here, here, here, here.

143
00:06:36,680 --> 00:06:39,690
I'm sorry, I know we're
gonna find gold here, okay!

144
00:06:39,690 --> 00:06:42,060
"Dear Santa, I might be too old

145
00:06:42,060 --> 00:06:44,170
"to be writing you but
you are my only hope.

146
00:06:44,170 --> 00:06:46,340
"My mommy died when I was two,

147
00:06:46,340 --> 00:06:47,890
"Daddy and I have been alone ever since.

148
00:06:47,890 --> 00:06:52,010
"He's a very good daddy!

149
00:06:52,010 --> 00:06:54,480
"But all I really want
for Christmas is a mommy,

150
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,360
"I think Daddy would like that, too.

151
00:06:56,360 --> 00:06:58,640
"I don't want us to be
alone again this year.

152
00:06:58,640 --> 00:07:00,860
"I know I'm asking a lot but
I hope you can bring someone

153
00:07:00,860 --> 00:07:03,330
"to love us both, love, Felice Wallace!"

154
00:07:03,330 --> 00:07:04,160
Smell that!

155
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:05,810
Do you know what that is?

156
00:07:05,810 --> 00:07:06,860
Ratings!

157
00:07:06,860 --> 00:07:09,310
Mary, this is it, this is your family!

158
00:07:09,310 --> 00:07:11,560
I want you to follow the
single father and his daughter

159
00:07:11,560 --> 00:07:13,100
as they struggle to get through Christmas.

160
00:07:13,100 --> 00:07:15,440
- No, Mac, this family
has enough problems,

161
00:07:15,440 --> 00:07:17,100
I don't wanna impose on their privacy!

162
00:07:17,100 --> 00:07:18,310
- Privacy?

163
00:07:18,310 --> 00:07:19,610
Mary, privacy?

164
00:07:19,610 --> 00:07:21,030
You're a reporter!

165
00:07:21,030 --> 00:07:22,960
Listen, if you wanna
get into the news you...

166
00:07:22,960 --> 00:07:24,870
- There's no way this
little girl can get her wish

167
00:07:24,870 --> 00:07:26,630
in the next four days,
it would be a downer!

168
00:07:26,630 --> 00:07:31,630
- But, Mary Maloney, no,
no, no, no, Mary Christmas!

169
00:07:31,860 --> 00:07:35,430
Yeah, she'll be able to figure
out the good, happy angle!

170
00:07:35,430 --> 00:07:36,870
This is it, Mary, I'm
assigning you this story!

171
00:07:36,870 --> 00:07:38,680
- No!
- No, I can see it!

172
00:07:38,680 --> 00:07:40,790
The dad, he's struggling
to make ends meet,

173
00:07:40,790 --> 00:07:42,000
and the little kid, him and her,

174
00:07:42,000 --> 00:07:44,610
they live in some shabby cottage
without a woman's touch...

175
00:07:44,610 --> 00:07:45,640
- Mac!

176
00:07:45,640 --> 00:07:47,080
No.

177
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,670
I am not doing this.

178
00:07:49,670 --> 00:07:50,650
- Mary.

179
00:07:51,490 --> 00:07:54,130
Mary, if you do this for me I,

180
00:07:54,130 --> 00:07:57,590
I promise you on my own next promotion

181
00:07:57,590 --> 00:07:59,990
that I will have Duckworth
move you to the news.

182
00:08:01,910 --> 00:08:03,570
I'll put my own job on the line.

183
00:08:07,230 --> 00:08:08,840
Mary, it's that important to me.

184
00:08:16,170 --> 00:08:18,020
- Give me this.

185
00:08:18,020 --> 00:08:18,850
I'll call them.

186
00:08:18,850 --> 00:08:20,050
- No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!

187
00:08:20,050 --> 00:08:24,460
Call, no, Mary Maloney doesn't
call, Mary Maloney shows up!

188
00:08:24,460 --> 00:08:28,160
See, they see the pretty
smile and they can't say no.

189
00:08:30,760 --> 00:08:32,620
- Whatever you say, boss.

190
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,900
- That's a good sport, Mary!

191
00:08:35,900 --> 00:08:37,360
- Don't make it worse, Mac!

192
00:08:38,380 --> 00:08:39,290
- Ho ho ho!

193
00:08:46,440 --> 00:08:48,050
- Tony, it's all so beautiful.

194
00:08:48,050 --> 00:08:51,000
- Heh, you ain't seen nothin' yet!

195
00:09:09,010 --> 00:09:10,960
Oh!

196
00:09:10,960 --> 00:09:12,410
- Wow!

197
00:09:12,410 --> 00:09:13,240
Yeah!

198
00:09:15,320 --> 00:09:17,690
It looks just like Christmas.

199
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,460
Except there's no snow.

200
00:09:19,460 --> 00:09:20,930
- Ah, who needs snow?

201
00:09:20,930 --> 00:09:23,090
I like sunshine all year long!

202
00:09:23,090 --> 00:09:26,870
- Not me, I like it when
it snows at Christmas.

203
00:09:33,190 --> 00:09:34,480
Hi, Daddy!

204
00:09:34,480 --> 00:09:35,330
- Hi, sweetheart!

205
00:09:36,930 --> 00:09:38,680
How's my big girl?

206
00:09:38,680 --> 00:09:39,510
- Good!

207
00:09:41,450 --> 00:09:42,280
- Tony?

208
00:09:43,580 --> 00:09:45,850
The house looks beautiful!

209
00:09:47,120 --> 00:09:49,360
- I picked out the colours,
they're my favourite.

210
00:09:49,360 --> 00:09:51,940
- Well, they're
my favourite too, sweetie.

211
00:09:51,940 --> 00:09:52,890
- Cool, huh?

212
00:09:52,890 --> 00:09:54,380
- Yeah.

213
00:09:54,380 --> 00:09:56,140
Tony, great job.

214
00:09:56,140 --> 00:09:57,890
Come on, Felice, I am starved!

215
00:09:57,890 --> 00:09:59,390
- Okay.

216
00:09:59,390 --> 00:10:01,150
- [Joel] Mm, something smells good!

217
00:10:05,200 --> 00:10:08,990
- Rosa made salad too before
she left, it's in the fridge.

218
00:10:08,990 --> 00:10:10,510
- Terrific!

219
00:10:10,510 --> 00:10:12,380
Sweetheart, have you decided what

220
00:10:12,380 --> 00:10:14,300
you wanna do for Christmas yet?

221
00:10:15,330 --> 00:10:17,880
- Can't we just spend
Christmas at home together?

222
00:10:18,850 --> 00:10:20,960
- Well, yeah, I suppose we could do that

223
00:10:20,960 --> 00:10:23,030
but it's not very exciting around here

224
00:10:23,030 --> 00:10:24,520
with just the two of us.

225
00:10:24,520 --> 00:10:27,420
- Doesn't always have to be
just the two of us, you know.

226
00:10:28,370 --> 00:10:30,470
- I suppose not, I can always call

227
00:10:30,470 --> 00:10:33,140
some friends and invite 'em on over.

228
00:10:34,150 --> 00:10:36,610
Don't you think it's time you told me

229
00:10:36,610 --> 00:10:38,110
what you want for Christmas?

230
00:10:40,600 --> 00:10:42,200
- I wish you could make it snow.

231
00:10:43,610 --> 00:10:48,610
- Sweetheart, why is making
it snow so important to you?

232
00:10:50,080 --> 00:10:52,130
- Dad, it's what makes Christmas special!

233
00:10:59,290 --> 00:11:01,200
- Some shabby cottage.

234
00:11:02,890 --> 00:11:05,560
- So, what do you want for Christmas?

235
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:08,620
- How 'bout one kiss
from my big girl, huh?

236
00:11:10,080 --> 00:11:11,790
Let's pray, I'm hungry.

237
00:11:11,790 --> 00:11:12,630
- Okay.

238
00:11:19,790 --> 00:11:21,690
- Did you order pizza again?

239
00:11:21,690 --> 00:11:22,900
- No!

240
00:11:22,900 --> 00:11:23,750
- I'll get it.

241
00:11:35,100 --> 00:11:35,940
- Santa'll make it snow.

242
00:11:39,810 --> 00:11:40,900
- Mr. Wallace?

243
00:11:42,020 --> 00:11:43,200
- Yes?

244
00:11:43,200 --> 00:11:46,010
- Hi, Mary Maloney, KBTS News.

245
00:11:46,010 --> 00:11:47,740
Merry Christmas!

246
00:11:47,740 --> 00:11:49,790
- Hey Dad, she's the lady from TV!

247
00:11:49,790 --> 00:11:50,890
- That's right!

248
00:11:50,890 --> 00:11:52,910
And you must be Felice.

249
00:11:52,910 --> 00:11:53,740
- Yeah!

250
00:11:53,740 --> 00:11:55,240
- You've been selected
for a special segment

251
00:11:55,240 --> 00:11:57,140
we're doing on families at Christmas.

252
00:11:57,140 --> 00:11:57,970
- I don't think so.

253
00:11:57,970 --> 00:11:59,610
- We're looking for single parent families

254
00:11:59,610 --> 00:12:01,330
and you were recommended.

255
00:12:01,330 --> 00:12:02,370
May I come in?

256
00:12:02,370 --> 00:12:03,230
- Yes!

257
00:12:03,230 --> 00:12:05,970
- Look, um, Felice...

258
00:12:05,970 --> 00:12:07,230
- Thank you.

259
00:12:07,230 --> 00:12:08,060
- Felice!

260
00:12:14,650 --> 00:12:16,230
- Please, sit here.

261
00:12:16,230 --> 00:12:17,230
- Thank you.

262
00:12:17,230 --> 00:12:19,320
- May I get you something to drink?

263
00:12:19,320 --> 00:12:21,030
- Oh, no, thank you.

264
00:12:22,670 --> 00:12:24,820
- Felice...
- Look, I'll cut to the chase.

265
00:12:25,690 --> 00:12:27,240
I'd like to come back with my crew

266
00:12:27,240 --> 00:12:29,900
and be a fly on the wall
for the next few days.

267
00:12:29,900 --> 00:12:31,970
Taping your holiday preparations

268
00:12:31,970 --> 00:12:34,420
and just hanging out with you and Felice.

269
00:12:34,420 --> 00:12:36,160
- No, I don't think so.

270
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,050
- Daddy, we could be on TV!

271
00:12:38,050 --> 00:12:39,160
- That's right!

272
00:12:39,160 --> 00:12:42,730
You could be an inspiration to
other single parent families.

273
00:12:42,730 --> 00:12:44,210
- Yes, Daddy, please!

274
00:12:44,210 --> 00:12:48,030
- Felice, sweetheart, I don't
think this is a good idea,

275
00:12:48,030 --> 00:12:49,680
it's way too intrusive.

276
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:53,210
- It won't be, we'll, we'll
blend into the wallpaper.

277
00:12:53,210 --> 00:12:54,260
- Can I speak to you?

278
00:12:55,160 --> 00:12:55,990
Please?

279
00:12:57,530 --> 00:12:58,360
- Sure.

280
00:13:01,500 --> 00:13:02,330
- Alone.

281
00:13:10,030 --> 00:13:12,850
Look, uh, sit down.

282
00:13:13,940 --> 00:13:16,190
I've never really been
a big fan of the media

283
00:13:17,190 --> 00:13:21,100
and this story sounds like
just another one of those

284
00:13:21,100 --> 00:13:23,400
tearjerker manipulative
things that they do on...

285
00:13:23,400 --> 00:13:25,900
- No, no, I'll put it in a positive light,

286
00:13:25,900 --> 00:13:28,380
it'll be an upbeat Christmas story!

287
00:13:28,380 --> 00:13:32,420
- Miss Maloney, I've seen your work

288
00:13:32,420 --> 00:13:34,740
and I like it, I really do, but I'm,

289
00:13:35,650 --> 00:13:39,120
I'm just not, not comfortable with this.

290
00:13:43,370 --> 00:13:45,160
Do you have any kids, Miss Maloney?

291
00:13:48,750 --> 00:13:49,580
- No.

292
00:13:53,000 --> 00:13:54,740
- Well, Felice's mother died when Felice

293
00:13:54,740 --> 00:13:57,610
was only two-years-old
and I promised myself that

294
00:13:57,610 --> 00:14:01,250
that little girl would not have
a sad Christmas ever again.

295
00:14:04,580 --> 00:14:07,730
You see, she means the world
to me and I, I don't want

296
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:10,450
her turned into some little
pathetic media darling,

297
00:14:10,450 --> 00:14:13,470
you know, the poor little rich
girl and I watch the news,

298
00:14:13,470 --> 00:14:14,550
I know what the stories are,

299
00:14:14,550 --> 00:14:16,880
they're all just a bunch of hype and no...

300
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:17,710
- Heart.

301
00:14:20,200 --> 00:14:21,030
- Right!

302
00:14:22,350 --> 00:14:23,180
- Right.

303
00:14:26,400 --> 00:14:28,190
I couldn't agree with you more.

304
00:14:28,190 --> 00:14:30,510
If I were you, I would say no.

305
00:14:32,710 --> 00:14:35,740
- Wait a minute, now when,

306
00:14:37,520 --> 00:14:39,820
when exactly did we change sides?

307
00:14:39,820 --> 00:14:43,130
- Who said
anything about sides?

308
00:14:43,130 --> 00:14:47,140
Look, it's been a pleasure
not doing business with you.

309
00:14:49,050 --> 00:14:50,750
And you have a beautiful daughter.

310
00:14:51,750 --> 00:14:52,580
- Thank you.

311
00:14:53,950 --> 00:14:57,380
And I appreciate your understanding.

312
00:14:58,590 --> 00:15:01,260
I'm surprised but I'm appreciative.

313
00:15:01,260 --> 00:15:04,490
- You're actually doing
me a favour, so thank you.

314
00:15:07,220 --> 00:15:08,070
- You're welcome.

315
00:15:10,330 --> 00:15:11,160
- Okay.

316
00:15:13,660 --> 00:15:15,210
- I'll walk you out.

317
00:15:15,210 --> 00:15:16,040
- Great.

318
00:15:18,560 --> 00:15:20,050
- Mary.

319
00:15:20,050 --> 00:15:22,090
- Thank you.

320
00:15:22,090 --> 00:15:23,300
Merry Christmas.

321
00:15:23,300 --> 00:15:24,130
- And to you.

322
00:15:38,750 --> 00:15:39,580
Hm.

323
00:15:50,500 --> 00:15:52,080
- Mary Maloney, hm.

324
00:15:53,470 --> 00:15:54,310
Joel!

325
00:15:54,310 --> 00:15:55,280
- Samantha!

326
00:15:55,280 --> 00:15:56,810
- Hi, I hope I'm not too early.

327
00:15:56,810 --> 00:15:58,330
- No, no, you're right on time.

328
00:15:58,330 --> 00:15:59,850
You remember Felice?

329
00:15:59,850 --> 00:16:01,520
- Well, hello Felice!

330
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:05,500
- Why don't you say hello, Felice?

331
00:16:06,540 --> 00:16:07,370
- Hello.

332
00:16:11,010 --> 00:16:11,840
- Come on in.

333
00:16:14,420 --> 00:16:16,520
You sit right here, Samantha.

334
00:16:17,430 --> 00:16:20,540
- Say, wasn't that the
television reporter leaving?

335
00:16:20,540 --> 00:16:21,400
Mary Maloney?

336
00:16:22,310 --> 00:16:23,990
- Yeah, yes it was.

337
00:16:23,990 --> 00:16:26,150
- Wow, what was she doing here?

338
00:16:26,150 --> 00:16:29,390
- Well, she wanted us to be
on TV but it was a bad idea.

339
00:16:30,580 --> 00:16:31,820
- I didn't think so.

340
00:16:34,420 --> 00:16:37,350
- So, what're you two doing for Christmas?

341
00:16:38,630 --> 00:16:41,250
- Samantha, I am so glad that you asked!

342
00:16:42,240 --> 00:16:45,250
How would you like to join
Felice and I for Christmas?

343
00:16:47,090 --> 00:16:49,270
- I would love to!

344
00:16:49,270 --> 00:16:52,300
But I always have Christmas
with my family in Oakdale.

345
00:16:52,300 --> 00:16:54,540
Mommy and Daddy would
love to meet you both!

346
00:16:56,620 --> 00:16:57,450
- Great!

347
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,370
- Okay, wait, we're having dinner here!

348
00:17:05,370 --> 00:17:07,800
- We always open our
presents on Christmas Eve,

349
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,000
you can spend the night!

350
00:17:09,850 --> 00:17:10,850
- But Santa brings our presents

351
00:17:10,850 --> 00:17:12,760
on Christmas morning, right Daddy?

352
00:17:14,050 --> 00:17:16,760
- Well, yes he does,
sweetheart, but I'm sure that

353
00:17:16,760 --> 00:17:19,600
Santa brings presents to
some houses on Christmas Eve.

354
00:17:21,310 --> 00:17:23,960
- But Santa wouldn't know
to bring my presents there!

355
00:17:26,090 --> 00:17:28,050
- Felice, we could leave a note.

356
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,110
- I'm opening my presents
on Christmas morning.

357
00:17:33,050 --> 00:17:36,600
- Samantha, it was a very, very
nice invitation, thank you.

358
00:17:38,850 --> 00:17:41,200
- So, what do you want
for Christmas, Felice?

359
00:17:43,580 --> 00:17:46,020
- Felice is having a little
trouble determining exactly what

360
00:17:46,020 --> 00:17:49,020
it is that she wants for
Christmas, isn't that right, honey?

361
00:17:55,870 --> 00:17:57,770
Felice, what's the matter, sweetheart?

362
00:17:59,930 --> 00:18:01,810
I don't wanna go to Oakdale,

363
00:18:01,810 --> 00:18:03,860
I wanna be on TV with Mary Maloney

364
00:18:03,860 --> 00:18:07,170
and all I want for Christmas
is to be on TV, Dad!

365
00:18:13,540 --> 00:18:14,640
- That didn't go well.

366
00:18:16,340 --> 00:18:17,170
I'm sorry.

367
00:18:18,350 --> 00:18:20,360
- No, you have to do this story.

368
00:18:20,360 --> 00:18:22,320
- Mac, it's outta my hands.

369
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,430
The guy doesn't wanna do it
and, frankly, I don't blame him!

370
00:18:24,430 --> 00:18:26,590
- For you information, I already told

371
00:18:26,590 --> 00:18:28,270
Duckworth about the story.

372
00:18:28,270 --> 00:18:29,460
I told him about the little girl

373
00:18:29,460 --> 00:18:31,610
and the letter to Santa
and she wants a mommy

374
00:18:31,610 --> 00:18:34,280
and I also told him how wonderful you are

375
00:18:34,280 --> 00:18:35,380
and how we're gonna lose you

376
00:18:35,380 --> 00:18:36,980
unless he moves you to the news.

377
00:18:37,880 --> 00:18:38,900
- And?

378
00:18:38,900 --> 00:18:42,130
- And he said if you can deliver
the ratings on this story,

379
00:18:42,130 --> 00:18:43,960
he will move you into
the news at the beginning

380
00:18:43,960 --> 00:18:45,990
of next year, which is like in a week.

381
00:18:47,530 --> 00:18:49,080
- So I'll get another story.

382
00:18:49,080 --> 00:18:51,190
- Duckworth does not want another story,

383
00:18:51,190 --> 00:18:54,850
Duckworth wants this story and so do I.

384
00:18:54,850 --> 00:18:56,250
Do you remember Nancy Dunne?

385
00:18:57,540 --> 00:18:58,760
Exactly!

386
00:18:58,760 --> 00:19:00,750
She used to work here,
then she crossed Duckworth.

387
00:19:00,750 --> 00:19:01,590
Get my point?

388
00:19:03,320 --> 00:19:04,700
- Yeah, I got it.

389
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:15,150
- Again, I'm sorry about
Felice, I'll talk to her

390
00:19:15,150 --> 00:19:17,250
about Christmas as soon as she calms down.

391
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:21,210
- Does she know we've
been seeing each other?

392
00:19:21,210 --> 00:19:24,450
- Oh yeah, just the TV thing's
got her upset, that's all.

393
00:19:28,360 --> 00:19:32,500
- Well, good night, Joel.

394
00:19:33,440 --> 00:19:34,670
- Good night.

395
00:19:38,770 --> 00:19:40,240
Thanks for understanding.

396
00:19:40,240 --> 00:19:41,720
- [Samantha] Bye.

397
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:02,460
- Me again!

398
00:20:02,460 --> 00:20:03,810
- You forget something?

399
00:20:03,810 --> 00:20:05,420
- Not exactly.

400
00:20:05,420 --> 00:20:06,250
- Look...

401
00:20:06,250 --> 00:20:07,980
- Before you say anything,
just hear me out.

402
00:20:07,980 --> 00:20:08,810
- Mary...

403
00:20:08,810 --> 00:20:10,130
- On the way to the
station I was thinking,

404
00:20:10,130 --> 00:20:11,490
we can work this out...

405
00:20:11,490 --> 00:20:12,380
- Okay.

406
00:20:12,380 --> 00:20:14,610
- Forget about the backstory,

407
00:20:14,610 --> 00:20:19,610
uh, it's just a family getting ready

408
00:20:19,630 --> 00:20:20,880
for Christmas, totally...

409
00:20:21,840 --> 00:20:23,610
Did you, you said okay?

410
00:20:23,610 --> 00:20:25,030
- Yes.

411
00:20:25,030 --> 00:20:26,330
- You mean you'll do it?

412
00:20:26,330 --> 00:20:29,360
- Okay, I'll, we'll do it.

413
00:20:29,360 --> 00:20:30,500
- Great!

414
00:20:30,500 --> 00:20:32,460
We switched sides again!

415
00:20:32,460 --> 00:20:34,630
What made you change your mind?

416
00:20:34,630 --> 00:20:35,610
- I'll tell you what changed my mind

417
00:20:35,610 --> 00:20:37,830
if you tell em what changed yours.

418
00:20:37,830 --> 00:20:42,830
- Um, I'll get fired if I
don't do the story, you?

419
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:44,830
- Felice really wants to do it

420
00:20:44,830 --> 00:20:46,340
and I just can't seem to tell her no.

421
00:20:47,300 --> 00:20:51,460
- Huh, well, so much for the
strength of our convictions.

422
00:20:51,460 --> 00:20:53,870
- Yes, score
one more point for hype.

423
00:20:53,870 --> 00:20:56,600
- No hype, I promise!

424
00:20:56,600 --> 00:21:01,530
Okay, uh, 10 a.m. my
crew and I will be here.

425
00:21:01,530 --> 00:21:02,430
- Okay!

426
00:21:02,430 --> 00:21:05,170
Oh, uh, no, I'm not gonna be here,

427
00:21:05,170 --> 00:21:06,140
I have a meeting in the morning,

428
00:21:06,140 --> 00:21:09,590
but Felice has a terrific nanny.

429
00:21:09,590 --> 00:21:10,820
- Okay.
- Okay.

430
00:21:10,820 --> 00:21:11,820
- We're in business.

431
00:21:12,930 --> 00:21:15,910
- This is a '56 DeSoto, right?

432
00:21:15,910 --> 00:21:17,410
- You got it, how'd you guess?

433
00:21:18,700 --> 00:21:19,930
- Always been a fan of cars.

434
00:21:19,930 --> 00:21:20,830
- Yeah, me too.

435
00:21:22,030 --> 00:21:23,870
Okay.
- Okay.

436
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:27,290
- Nice lights, my favourite colours.

437
00:21:27,290 --> 00:21:28,120
- Mine too!

438
00:21:32,730 --> 00:21:34,170
- How did you get him to do it?

439
00:21:34,170 --> 00:21:36,720
- I didn't, he changed his mind.

440
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:38,590
Oh, and that shabby little cottage?

441
00:21:38,590 --> 00:21:39,710
It's a mansion.

442
00:21:39,710 --> 00:21:40,780
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

443
00:21:40,780 --> 00:21:41,810
- Are they attractive?

444
00:21:41,810 --> 00:21:42,940
- Very!

445
00:21:42,940 --> 00:21:43,770
- Sympathetic?

446
00:21:43,770 --> 00:21:44,770
- Extremely!

447
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,880
Mac, they're absolutely perfect.

448
00:21:46,880 --> 00:21:48,130
- I'll tell Duckworth.

449
00:21:48,130 --> 00:21:48,960
- Great.

450
00:21:50,330 --> 00:21:51,780
Be sure to take all the credit.

451
00:21:51,780 --> 00:21:54,890
- Ah, come on, can't you,
can't you do this one thing?

452
00:21:54,890 --> 00:21:56,950
Look, I need to drop her
off on my way to work.

453
00:21:56,950 --> 00:22:00,750
One day that, yeah, okay, all right, fine.

454
00:22:00,750 --> 00:22:02,650
Merry Christmas to you.

455
00:22:04,960 --> 00:22:06,660
Great sister you turned out to be.

456
00:22:12,450 --> 00:22:14,570
- Is everything okay, Daddy?

457
00:22:14,570 --> 00:22:16,120
- Oh, yeah, sweetheart, it's...

458
00:22:18,370 --> 00:22:22,100
No, I forgot that Tony
and Rosa have the week off

459
00:22:22,100 --> 00:22:23,700
for Christmas and I
don't have anybody here

460
00:22:23,700 --> 00:22:25,450
to sit at the house with you today.

461
00:22:26,320 --> 00:22:28,450
- I could go to work with you.

462
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:29,820
- No, Felice, you can't
go to work with me.

463
00:22:29,820 --> 00:22:32,850
I got a big deal if I don't get
it by the end of the year...

464
00:22:34,880 --> 00:22:35,710
Hey!

465
00:22:36,800 --> 00:22:37,630
You know what?

466
00:22:38,540 --> 00:22:40,270
I have a big surprise for you.

467
00:22:41,790 --> 00:22:42,620
- What?

468
00:22:46,050 --> 00:22:48,650
- Oh no, that's what I told her!

469
00:22:48,650 --> 00:22:50,300
- Told who?

470
00:22:50,300 --> 00:22:53,070
- You remember that
really nice lady reporter

471
00:22:53,070 --> 00:22:54,570
that was here the other day?

472
00:22:54,570 --> 00:22:55,900
- Mary Maloney?

473
00:22:55,900 --> 00:22:57,000
- Yeah.

474
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,520
I changed my mind, she's coming here

475
00:22:58,520 --> 00:23:00,460
at 10 o'clock to shoot a story.

476
00:23:00,460 --> 00:23:03,690
- Yes, thank you, Daddy,
thank you, thank you!

477
00:23:03,690 --> 00:23:05,260
- Yeah, you're very
welcome, but the problem is

478
00:23:05,260 --> 00:23:06,470
I told her that you had a terrific nanny

479
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,670
and you don't have any nanny at all.

480
00:23:08,670 --> 00:23:10,210
- The phone book?

481
00:23:10,210 --> 00:23:12,850
You're looking for my
nanny in the phone book?

482
00:23:12,850 --> 00:23:14,600
- Yeah, well, I need to be at
work and you need to be here,

483
00:23:14,600 --> 00:23:17,820
what choice do I, hello?

484
00:23:17,820 --> 00:23:21,580
Yes, my name is Joel
Wallace, I need a nanny.

485
00:23:21,580 --> 00:23:23,800
Today, half an hour.

486
00:23:25,540 --> 00:23:26,990
Listen, I have a nine-year-old daughter

487
00:23:26,990 --> 00:23:31,990
and she is extremely well-behaved
and I need some help.

488
00:23:34,180 --> 00:23:35,800
With references?

489
00:23:37,230 --> 00:23:38,130
In a half an hour?

490
00:23:40,150 --> 00:23:43,450
Well, yeah, okay, fine.

491
00:23:43,450 --> 00:23:47,040
It's Wallace, 32 Weatherly Road.

492
00:23:49,210 --> 00:23:50,850
Well, Merry Christmas to you!

493
00:23:55,380 --> 00:23:57,220
I think it's gonna work out.

494
00:23:59,380 --> 00:24:00,410
- Okay, Dad.

495
00:24:00,410 --> 00:24:02,050
- [Joel] Cheers.

496
00:24:02,050 --> 00:24:04,900
- If I had three wishes
they'd all be the same,

497
00:24:04,900 --> 00:24:07,560
I wish Christmas were over,
I wish Christmas were over,

498
00:24:07,560 --> 00:24:09,720
I wish Christmas were over.

499
00:24:09,720 --> 00:24:11,230
- My three would be a Heritage Valley

500
00:24:11,230 --> 00:24:13,680
collectable gnome number
54, the tennis player,

501
00:24:14,820 --> 00:24:16,970
a couple CDs, a trip to Bermuda for me

502
00:24:16,970 --> 00:24:18,460
to recover from Christmas shopping.

503
00:24:18,460 --> 00:24:21,850
- Oh, free yourself, Hal, this
year I'm not shopping at all.

504
00:24:21,850 --> 00:24:22,750
- Scrooge!

505
00:24:22,750 --> 00:24:24,260
- I didn't say I wasn't celebrating,

506
00:24:24,260 --> 00:24:26,160
I'm just not buying anything.

507
00:24:26,160 --> 00:24:28,570
I'm making my own cards
and gifts and paper,

508
00:24:28,570 --> 00:24:30,340
baking cookies, the whole nine yards!

509
00:24:30,340 --> 00:24:31,800
- That sounds like a lotta work.

510
00:24:31,800 --> 00:24:32,630
- Not really.

511
00:24:32,630 --> 00:24:34,900
The secret is, lists!

512
00:24:34,900 --> 00:24:36,960
The Eleanor Ellis Christmas Organizer,

513
00:24:36,960 --> 00:24:39,350
she does everything herself, so can I!

514
00:24:39,350 --> 00:24:41,370
- [Hal] Yeah, with a staff of 30!

515
00:24:41,370 --> 00:24:42,670
- Thank you.

516
00:24:42,670 --> 00:24:44,740
- Uh, say, how'd you get that book?

517
00:24:44,740 --> 00:24:45,940
- Bought it.

518
00:24:45,940 --> 00:24:46,910
- Bought it?

519
00:24:46,910 --> 00:24:48,060
In a store?

520
00:24:50,990 --> 00:24:53,210
- I bet it's snowing in Vermont today.

521
00:25:00,540 --> 00:25:01,990
- Felice?

522
00:25:01,990 --> 00:25:02,950
Is your room neat?

523
00:25:03,780 --> 00:25:04,980
- [Felice] Kinda!

524
00:25:04,980 --> 00:25:06,290
- Kinda.

525
00:25:06,290 --> 00:25:07,510
- [Felice] Daddy?

526
00:25:07,510 --> 00:25:10,810
How long does it take for a
letter to get to the North Pole?

527
00:25:10,810 --> 00:25:13,160
- I don't think it takes
that long, sweetheart.

528
00:25:15,290 --> 00:25:16,120
It's time.

529
00:25:19,210 --> 00:25:21,450
Punctual, I like her already!

530
00:25:25,940 --> 00:25:26,770
Yes?

531
00:25:26,770 --> 00:25:27,970
- Good morning!

532
00:25:27,970 --> 00:25:28,800
- Good morning.

533
00:25:28,800 --> 00:25:30,150
- I'm here from the agency.

534
00:25:32,240 --> 00:25:34,210
- Wait, you're the, you're the nanny?

535
00:25:34,210 --> 00:25:36,750
- I prefer to be called governor,

536
00:25:36,750 --> 00:25:40,310
it's the masculine form of governess.

537
00:25:41,270 --> 00:25:43,390
- Um, sir, I don't...

538
00:25:43,390 --> 00:25:44,660
- How do you do?

539
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:46,840
- Hi.

540
00:25:46,840 --> 00:25:48,700
Do you wanna be on TV?

541
00:25:48,700 --> 00:25:52,290
- Oh, madam, I live to be on TV.

542
00:25:52,290 --> 00:25:54,330
- [Felice] Mary Maloney'll
be here in half an hour.

543
00:25:54,330 --> 00:25:55,710
- You don't say!

544
00:25:55,710 --> 00:25:59,090
Well, we better put this
place in shape, huh?

545
00:26:03,030 --> 00:26:04,110
- I like him!

546
00:26:11,930 --> 00:26:14,500
- Oh, this is wonderful!

547
00:26:14,500 --> 00:26:18,110
Hal, you've gotta get a
shot of that and the swings,

548
00:26:18,110 --> 00:26:20,120
oh, this is just terrific,
this is gonna be perfect!

549
00:26:20,120 --> 00:26:22,620
- Oh, I get it, we're doing the
poor little rich girl story.

550
00:26:22,620 --> 00:26:25,170
- Don't ever say that.

551
00:26:26,370 --> 00:26:27,820
You either, nobody say that.

552
00:26:28,980 --> 00:26:30,680
- Come on, Hal, let's
get set up over there.

553
00:26:30,680 --> 00:26:33,590
We're gonna take some shots and
we're gonna do some of this.

554
00:26:38,180 --> 00:26:39,010
Stop!

555
00:26:44,160 --> 00:26:45,800
- Oh, hello, Mary, welcome!

556
00:26:45,800 --> 00:26:47,610
- Hi!
- I'm Les Turner.

557
00:26:47,610 --> 00:26:50,690
- Hello, Les, are you Felice's...

558
00:26:50,690 --> 00:26:52,200
- Mary, Mary!

559
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:53,030
- Hi!

560
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:55,580
- This is Les, he's my governor,
it's kinda like a nanny.

561
00:26:55,580 --> 00:26:57,090
- Oh!

562
00:26:57,090 --> 00:26:58,730
Oh, very nice to meet you.

563
00:26:59,920 --> 00:27:02,910
- It's not kinda like a nanny,
it's kinda like a governor.

564
00:27:05,720 --> 00:27:07,160
- Thank you.

565
00:27:07,160 --> 00:27:11,200
So, Les, I just need a little
background information.

566
00:27:12,170 --> 00:27:14,950
How did you become a nanny, or governor?

567
00:27:14,950 --> 00:27:16,890
- Have a cookie, Cookie?

568
00:27:16,890 --> 00:27:17,780
- Thanks.

569
00:27:17,780 --> 00:27:19,310
- Mm.

570
00:27:19,310 --> 00:27:21,750
- Mary, I started out
as a song and dance man

571
00:27:21,750 --> 00:27:24,430
in the dying days of vaudeville.

572
00:27:24,430 --> 00:27:25,260
- Oh!

573
00:27:25,260 --> 00:27:28,610
- When I got on the stage,
people clapped their hands,

574
00:27:28,610 --> 00:27:30,620
right over their eyes, ka-boom-ching!

575
00:27:32,270 --> 00:27:34,970
Well, anywho, did a few musicals,

576
00:27:34,970 --> 00:27:39,760
worked in a film now and then,
and worked on TV off and on.

577
00:27:39,760 --> 00:27:41,060
- I never saw you on TV.

578
00:27:41,060 --> 00:27:44,700
- Well, that's because most
people like me off more than on.

579
00:27:44,700 --> 00:27:47,860
- Heh, well, you'll be back on TV now.

580
00:27:47,860 --> 00:27:49,100
But why a governor?

581
00:27:49,100 --> 00:27:52,140
- Well, I had to earn a
living and I always liked kids

582
00:27:52,140 --> 00:27:55,870
and I knew my way around
a boarding house kitchen.

583
00:27:55,870 --> 00:27:57,300
It's really a very good job.

584
00:27:58,430 --> 00:28:01,410
- And how long have you
been Felice's governor?

585
00:28:01,410 --> 00:28:04,970
- Oh, we got way, way back.

586
00:28:04,970 --> 00:28:06,540
Right, Felice?

587
00:28:06,540 --> 00:28:07,370
- Right!

588
00:28:07,370 --> 00:28:08,560
Way, way back.

589
00:28:10,560 --> 00:28:11,460
- Anything else?

590
00:28:13,040 --> 00:28:14,270
- Well, Les, I'll have to get some more

591
00:28:14,270 --> 00:28:16,710
information from you later,
but why don't I go get my crew

592
00:28:16,710 --> 00:28:19,320
and maybe you could give
me a tour of the house?

593
00:28:19,320 --> 00:28:20,160
- Okay!

594
00:28:20,990 --> 00:28:22,740
There's the kitchen.

595
00:28:22,740 --> 00:28:25,270
There's the dining room.

596
00:28:25,270 --> 00:28:27,420
And that one there is the guest room.

597
00:28:27,420 --> 00:28:28,590
Here's Dad's room.

598
00:28:28,590 --> 00:28:32,780
And here's Tony and Rosa,
uh, I mean Les' room.

599
00:28:32,780 --> 00:28:34,870
- Huh, let's take a look.

600
00:28:40,430 --> 00:28:41,920
Nice!

601
00:28:41,920 --> 00:28:43,010
Going somewhere, Les?

602
00:28:43,010 --> 00:28:45,910
- Well, I'm always ready
in case I get my big break.

603
00:28:47,610 --> 00:28:51,000
- Come on, I wanna show you my room!

604
00:28:53,500 --> 00:28:56,660
- Whoops, looks like we got
our work cut out for us.

605
00:28:58,090 --> 00:29:00,770
- What a great dollhouse.

606
00:29:00,770 --> 00:29:01,860
- Yeah.

607
00:29:01,860 --> 00:29:04,040
- Who's that up there?

608
00:29:04,040 --> 00:29:06,110
- Oh, that's Santa.

609
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,180
But it doesn't make sense to
have a Santa without snow.

610
00:29:10,180 --> 00:29:11,140
- Snow?

611
00:29:11,140 --> 00:29:12,270
You want snow?

612
00:29:12,270 --> 00:29:15,360

619
00:29:31,500 --> 00:29:33,890

620

Shall I comb your hair, too?

- Sure.

622

626

627
00:30:00,300 --> 00:30:03,360

629

Getting ready for
Christmas is overwhelming

630
00:30:11,180 --> 00:30:13,840
for some families, but Felice Wallace,

631
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,340

and their unique governor,

632
00:30:17,340 --> 00:30:20,240

something special.

634

Even a messy room means fun
in this unusual household,

635
00:30:27,040 --> 00:30:29,180
because when you're getting
ready for the holidays,

636
00:30:29,180 --> 00:30:31,700
first you better clean up your act!

637

645
00:30:59,470 --> 00:31:00,930
maybe we'll all learn how to make

646

00:32:43,320 --> 00:32:44,200
- Yes!

673
00:32:44,200 --> 00:32:45,500
- Then you didn't.

674
00:32:45,500 --> 00:32:46,680
- Ka-boom!

675
00:32:46,680 --> 00:32:47,640

should be on the road
for a very long time.

684
00:33:06,610 --> 00:33:08,790
- Uh, no, it's Turner and Wallace,

685
00:33:08,790 --> 00:33:10,330
I still get top billing, you know.

686
00:33:10,330 --> 00:33:13,390
- I stand correct, Les, I'm sorry.

687
00:33:14,870 --> 00:33:16,380
- Nice reactions.

688
00:33:16,380 --> 00:33:18,260
Okay, that's a wrap.

689
00:33:18,260 --> 00:33:20,160
We can put voiceover in in the morning.

690
00:33:20,160 --> 00:33:21,370
- Great, I'll meet you in the van,

691
00:33:21,370 --> 00:33:22,920
I just need a moment with Joel.

692
00:33:23,760 --> 00:33:26,220

693
00:33:27,090 --> 00:33:29,470
- Oh, sure, come on, sweetie.

694
00:33:29,470 --> 00:33:30,380
- Very cute!

695
00:33:31,440 --> 00:33:34,700
- So, how'd it go today, was it good?

696
00:33:34,700 --> 00:33:35,530
- Great!

697
00:33:35,530 --> 00:33:36,920
- Yeah?
- Yeah, that Les is a gem.

698
00:33:36,920 --> 00:33:38,170
- Yes, he is.

699
00:33:39,710 --> 00:33:40,540
- But you should know,

700
00:33:40,540 --> 00:33:43,410
Felice was disappointed you weren't here.

701
00:33:43,410 --> 00:33:45,320
- Yeah, I, want some?
- No, thank you.

702
00:33:45,320 --> 00:33:46,670
- I'm in the middle of
a big business deal,

703
00:33:46,670 --> 00:33:48,350
I couldn't get away.

704
00:33:48,350 --> 00:33:51,190
But she understands, she's used to it.

705
00:33:52,670 --> 00:33:54,910
- Joel, I wasn't going to tell you this,

706
00:33:54,910 --> 00:33:56,350
but maybe I should mention how you were

707
00:33:56,350 --> 00:33:58,110
really chosen for this segment.

708
00:33:59,090 --> 00:34:00,510
- Sure.

709
00:34:00,510 --> 00:34:04,530
- We got a bunch of letters
to Santa down at the station

710
00:34:04,530 --> 00:34:06,400
and one was from Felice.

711
00:34:07,760 --> 00:34:09,610
Do you wanna know what she asked for?

712
00:34:11,060 --> 00:34:11,890
- Of course.

713
00:34:12,760 --> 00:34:15,660
- She said all she wants
for Christmas is a mommy,

714
00:34:17,710 --> 00:34:18,960
that you two were lonely.

715
00:34:21,850 --> 00:34:22,820
- She said that?

716
00:34:25,360 --> 00:34:27,210
Well, why wouldn't she tell me about it?

717
00:34:27,210 --> 00:34:29,810
I, I, I thought when she
didn't want us to be lonely

718
00:34:29,810 --> 00:34:31,370
that she just wanted company.

719
00:34:34,590 --> 00:34:35,420
Mary.

720
00:34:37,410 --> 00:34:42,060
When Felice's mother, Jeanie,
when Jeanie died, I promised

721
00:34:43,850 --> 00:34:46,560
that I would take the best
possible care of our daughter.

722
00:34:47,760 --> 00:34:51,070
So I became a bond broker,
I worked hard to make money,

723
00:34:51,070 --> 00:34:54,440
not because I love money
but because I love Felice.

724
00:34:54,440 --> 00:34:57,550
Felice means happy, did you know that?

725
00:35:01,360 --> 00:35:03,360
That's how we always wanted her to stay.

726
00:35:06,720 --> 00:35:08,020
Oh, I don't know why I'm saying all this,

727
00:35:08,020 --> 00:35:09,590
I don't normally talk this way, I'm sorry.

728
00:35:09,590 --> 00:35:11,670
- I don't mind listening.

729
00:35:13,720 --> 00:35:15,850
- It's not that I never
considered remarrying,

730
00:35:15,850 --> 00:35:18,720
it's just that I never thought anybody

731
00:35:18,720 --> 00:35:20,140
could come close to Jeanie.

732
00:35:21,690 --> 00:35:24,670
I thought, I guess I thought
that Felice wouldn't miss

733
00:35:24,670 --> 00:35:26,750
what she never had in the first place.

734
00:35:26,750 --> 00:35:27,870
- That's not true.

735
00:35:32,830 --> 00:35:33,760
- Wait a minute, you're not gonna use

736
00:35:33,760 --> 00:35:35,490
any of this in your story, are you?

737
00:35:36,430 --> 00:35:38,240
- Of course not.

738
00:35:38,240 --> 00:35:39,270
- I shouldn't have said any of this,

739
00:35:39,270 --> 00:35:41,490
you're a reporter, I forgot!

740
00:35:41,490 --> 00:35:43,610
- I'm not being a reporter right now.

741
00:35:43,610 --> 00:35:44,630
- You should not have opened up

742
00:35:44,630 --> 00:35:45,850
my daughter's letter to Santa,

743
00:35:45,850 --> 00:35:47,940
this is exactly the kind
of invasion of privacy

744
00:35:47,940 --> 00:35:49,100
that I was worried about!

745
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:50,410
- My boss opened the letter

746
00:35:50,410 --> 00:35:52,170
and I'm not gonna read it on the air!

747
00:35:52,170 --> 00:35:53,840
- I should hope not!

748
00:35:53,840 --> 00:35:55,690
And I hope that you realize, Miss Maloney,

749
00:35:55,690 --> 00:35:59,320
that life isn't just a series
of happy little sound bites.

750
00:35:59,320 --> 00:36:02,320
- Since when
did we switch sides again?

751
00:36:06,180 --> 00:36:07,660
- You're right, Mary, I'm sorry.

752
00:36:07,660 --> 00:36:12,030
I just guess the letter
thing kinda threw me.

753
00:36:14,770 --> 00:36:16,340
- I'm sorry for mentioning it.

754
00:36:17,630 --> 00:36:20,860
- I probably needed to
hear it, it just brought up

755
00:36:20,860 --> 00:36:22,530
a lot of feelings, that's...

756
00:36:26,320 --> 00:36:28,400
- So, should we come back tomorrow?

757
00:36:29,410 --> 00:36:31,630
- Yes, yes you should come back tomorrow,

758
00:36:31,630 --> 00:36:33,960
I don't wanna disappointed Felice.

759
00:36:39,830 --> 00:36:41,080
- Are you okay?

760
00:36:42,170 --> 00:36:43,920
- Oh yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

761
00:36:44,770 --> 00:36:46,460
In fact, I have a late dinner engagement,

762
00:36:46,460 --> 00:36:48,030
let me walk you to your car.

763
00:36:48,030 --> 00:36:53,030

Hey, didn't we have a dinner date?

- No.

776

could celebrate your coup.

00:37:45,100 --> 00:37:45,930

coup, the motherless kid,

779
00:37:48,410 --> 00:37:50,320
it's brilliant, it's great reporting.

780

What's all this stuff?

781
00:37:51,180 --> 00:37:52,760
What, did you rob a toy store?

782
00:37:54,350 --> 00:37:55,940
- No, I thought it would be nice

783
00:37:55,940 --> 00:37:58,620
to bring some gifts down
to the family shelter.

784
00:37:58,620 --> 00:37:59,450
- Oh.

785
00:37:59,450 --> 00:38:01,690
- I did a story on them
last year, you remember?

786
00:38:01,690 --> 00:38:04,760
- Yeah, yeah, I remember,
I remember everything.

787
00:38:04,760 --> 00:38:08,890
I just, you know, I thought
you hated Christmas.

788
00:38:08,890 --> 00:38:10,800
- I'm not Scrooge!

789
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:13,030
I think every kid deserves
something from Santa.

790
00:38:13,030 --> 00:38:14,290
- You know what I think,

791
00:38:14,290 --> 00:38:17,710
Mary
I-Hate-Christmas-Whenever-It's-Convenient
Maloney?

792
00:38:17,710 --> 00:38:18,980
I think you're a complete fraud,

793
00:38:18,980 --> 00:38:20,190
you have this Christmas tree!

794
00:38:20,190 --> 00:38:22,890
- Well, since you canceled my vacation...

795
00:38:22,890 --> 00:38:26,400
- Ah, I knew you
were gonna take that shot.

796
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:27,800
I mean, anyway, look at this
tree, look at this tree,

797
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,810
it's missing something,
it should have a star

798
00:38:30,810 --> 00:38:32,420
or something on top, shouldn't it?

799
00:38:33,400 --> 00:38:34,540
- I like it like this.

800
00:38:35,630 --> 00:38:37,380
- Hey, where's your corkscrew?

801
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,390
- You never give up, do you?

802
00:38:42,330 --> 00:38:44,840
- Why would I give up on
something I really want?

803
00:38:44,840 --> 00:38:48,000
- Because you can't have
everything you want, Mac.

804
00:38:48,950 --> 00:38:50,110
Even at Christmas.

805
00:38:55,440 --> 00:38:58,570

806
00:38:58,570 --> 00:38:59,410

- How 'bout a sweater?

828
00:40:04,610 --> 00:40:06,820
How 'bout a tie?

829
00:40:06,820 --> 00:40:09,130
Or how 'bout a baseball glove?

00:40:09,130 --> 00:40:11,110

00:40:11,110 --> 00:40:13,250
- Well, he probably always wanted one.

832
00:40:13,250 --> 00:40:14,240
- Never said so.

833
00:40:15,200 --> 00:40:17,040
Oh my gosh, Les, look!

834
00:40:17,910 --> 00:40:20,010
- Well, isn't that interesting.

835
00:40:20,010 --> 00:40:22,780
So, where are we going here, Cookie?

836
00:40:22,780 --> 00:40:23,920
- Gallagher's, down at the end.

837
00:40:23,920 --> 00:40:24,830
- Let's go.

838
00:40:37,120 --> 00:40:39,720
Morning, pal, how's it goin'?

839
00:40:39,720 --> 00:40:41,420
- Oh, worst day ever!

840
00:40:41,420 --> 00:40:42,320
Would you believe it?

841
00:40:42,320 --> 00:40:43,940
I haven't had a donation all day!

842
00:40:43,940 --> 00:40:45,340
People just don't care anymore.

843
00:40:45,340 --> 00:40:46,640
- Well, that's a shame!

844
00:40:55,510 --> 00:40:57,360
- Wow, thanks so much!

845
00:41:01,760 --> 00:41:03,090
Merry Christmas.

846
00:41:03,090 --> 00:41:05,180
- [Both] Merry Christmas!

847
00:41:18,500 --> 00:41:19,590
- Wow!

848
00:41:19,590 --> 00:41:20,420
Les, look!

849
00:41:21,330 --> 00:41:23,160
- That's more like it.

850
00:41:26,210 --> 00:41:28,370
- Hey, look, there's Mary!

851
00:41:29,430 --> 00:41:30,490
Hey, Mary!

852
00:41:30,490 --> 00:41:33,520
- Make sure to get some of that
on camera, would you please?

853
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,570
- Yeah, got it.

854
00:41:34,570 --> 00:41:35,570
- Good morning!

855
00:41:35,570 --> 00:41:36,460
- Hi!

856
00:41:36,460 --> 00:41:37,660
- Boy, you look pretty.

857
00:41:38,530 --> 00:41:39,910
People sure have the Christmas spirit

858
00:41:39,910 --> 00:41:41,650
around here, don't they?

859
00:41:41,650 --> 00:41:44,010
- They didn't a minute
ago, Les started it.

860
00:41:44,010 --> 00:41:44,840
- Nah.

861
00:41:46,600 --> 00:41:48,440
- So, what do you say?

862
00:41:48,440 --> 00:41:50,010
Let's go shopping!

863
00:41:50,010 --> 00:41:52,030
Have you decided what
you're gettin' your dad yet?

864
00:41:52,030 --> 00:41:53,340
- Yes!

865
00:42:01,530 --> 00:42:05,780
- Okay, tape is rolling,
sweetie, so do your stuff.

866
00:42:07,360 --> 00:42:09,370
- Daddies like this one a lot.

867
00:42:09,370 --> 00:42:12,270
- I like it, but does
it come in aquamarine?

868
00:42:12,270 --> 00:42:13,610
That's his favourite colour.

869
00:42:13,610 --> 00:42:16,170
- Oh, no, honey, I'm sorry,
just the ones you see here.

870
00:42:16,170 --> 00:42:18,430
How about hunter green?

871
00:42:18,430 --> 00:42:19,830
Daddy would like that I bet!

872
00:42:21,310 --> 00:42:23,410
- Look through the pile, Felice, hm?

873
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:35,540
- They must have aquamarine!

874
00:42:35,540 --> 00:42:38,750
- I said there wasn't that
colour, how about a nice yellow?

875
00:42:40,870 --> 00:42:44,620
- She doesn't want yellow, Milicent Faye,

876
00:42:44,620 --> 00:42:47,010
she wants aquamarine!

877
00:42:47,010 --> 00:42:51,260
And I have a feeling that in that pile

878
00:42:51,260 --> 00:42:56,260
there's at least one large
size aquamarine sweater.

879
00:42:57,040 --> 00:42:58,170
Trust me on that.

880
00:43:03,860 --> 00:43:04,790
- Here it is!

881
00:43:06,610 --> 00:43:07,960
Size large!

882
00:43:07,960 --> 00:43:10,010
I can't believe it!

883
00:43:10,010 --> 00:43:11,960
- Neither can I.

884
00:43:11,960 --> 00:43:14,620
- Next time look more closely maybe, hm?

885
00:43:14,620 --> 00:43:16,940
- Okay, well, we got what we wanted,

886
00:43:16,940 --> 00:43:19,940
so let's move over to
Santa's Village, okay?

887
00:43:21,550 --> 00:43:22,380
- Mary, did you see that?

888
00:43:22,380 --> 00:43:24,210
It was almost like magic!

889
00:43:24,210 --> 00:43:26,840
- Yeah, I think the
next time I go shopping

890
00:43:26,840 --> 00:43:28,130
I'm bringing Les with me.

891
00:43:42,700 --> 00:43:45,020
- Sorry, kid, time for Santa's break.

892
00:43:45,960 --> 00:43:49,200
Here's some candy, see ya.
- Aw, that's not fair!

893
00:43:49,200 --> 00:43:50,530
- What's he doing?

894
00:43:52,390 --> 00:43:55,350
- Hey, listen up, Santa'll
be back in an hour.

895
00:43:55,350 --> 00:43:56,440
Ho ho ho.

896
00:43:56,440 --> 00:43:57,990
- Where do they get these guys?

897
00:43:59,330 --> 00:44:01,160
- That's not the real Santa!

898
00:44:01,160 --> 00:44:02,630
- Of course not!

899
00:44:02,630 --> 00:44:04,030
- Ho ho ho.

900
00:44:04,030 --> 00:44:05,780
- Hey, where you goin'?

901
00:44:05,780 --> 00:44:07,000
Hey, bub!

902
00:44:07,000 --> 00:44:07,830
Hey!

903
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:08,860
Hey, Santa!

904
00:44:11,240 --> 00:44:12,310
You stay here.

905
00:45:09,410 --> 00:45:10,330
- Ho ho ho!

906
00:45:12,940 --> 00:45:14,450
- Look, it's Santa!

907
00:45:14,450 --> 00:45:16,760
It's the real Santa!

908
00:45:16,760 --> 00:45:18,190
- Merry Christmas!

909
00:45:18,190 --> 00:45:19,030
- Oh my!

910
00:45:20,240 --> 00:45:22,410
Is that who I think it is?

911
00:45:24,040 --> 00:45:27,030
Felice, go on up and join Les.

912
00:45:27,030 --> 00:45:27,870
- Okay.

913
00:45:28,870 --> 00:45:29,870
- Thank you.

914
00:45:35,530 --> 00:45:36,460
That's fantastic.

915
00:45:36,460 --> 00:45:37,530
- It's so great, I'm so excited!

916
00:45:37,530 --> 00:45:38,670
- Hal, are you getting all of that?

917
00:45:38,670 --> 00:45:40,180
- Merry Christmas, Mary Maloney!

918
00:45:43,800 --> 00:45:46,150
- If you're dreading that
last-minute trip to the mall,

919
00:45:46,150 --> 00:45:48,910
take heart, shoppers
today at Ridgecrest Mall

920
00:45:48,910 --> 00:45:51,100
were in for quite a treat from two of our

921
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,990
Home for the Holidays subjects,

922
00:45:52,990 --> 00:45:54,870
Felice Wallace and Les Turner.

923
00:45:54,870 --> 00:45:57,390
- Wait'll you see, Dad, wait'll you see!

924
00:45:57,390 --> 00:45:58,980
- [Mary] People were in a giving mood

925
00:45:58,980 --> 00:46:02,850
at Ridgecrest Mall today,
but no one was happier than

926
00:46:02,850 --> 00:46:06,050
Felice Wallace as she picked
out a present for her father.

927
00:46:06,050 --> 00:46:07,130
- Oh, Dad, don't look, don't look!

928
00:46:07,130 --> 00:46:09,500
- Okay, I'm not...
- Don't look, Dad!

929
00:46:09,500 --> 00:46:11,890
- I can't see a thing,
sweetheart, I promise!

930
00:46:11,890 --> 00:46:13,420
- It's just what Daddy wanted!

931
00:46:14,440 --> 00:46:16,410
- [Mary] And when Felice
had finished her shopping,

932
00:46:16,410 --> 00:46:18,540
she and her governor, Les Turner,

933
00:46:18,540 --> 00:46:21,680
stepped in to make the
Christmas season even merrier.

934
00:46:23,300 --> 00:46:24,960
As you can see, Felice and Les

935
00:46:24,960 --> 00:46:27,330
have a gift for spreading happiness.

936
00:46:27,330 --> 00:46:29,580
Keep watching tomorrow
night for another chapter

937
00:46:29,580 --> 00:46:33,090
in this very special story we
call Home for the Holidays.

938
00:46:33,090 --> 00:46:34,520
For KBTS, this is Mary Maloney.

939
00:46:34,520 --> 00:46:35,940
That's it!

940
00:46:35,940 --> 00:46:37,270
What do you think?

941
00:46:37,270 --> 00:46:39,160
- I love it, I'm on TV!

942
00:46:39,160 --> 00:46:42,670
- I have to admit, I loved
it too, it was fantastic!

943
00:46:42,670 --> 00:46:44,780
- Great, another satisfied customer!

944
00:46:44,780 --> 00:46:47,540
- Which means, Santa's little helper,

945
00:46:47,540 --> 00:46:50,600
it is time for you to go to bed.

946
00:46:50,600 --> 00:46:52,100
- Can Mary tuck me in tonight?

947
00:46:54,090 --> 00:46:54,920
- Uh...

948
00:46:56,310 --> 00:46:58,770
- Just so she's snug as a bug in a rug.

949
00:46:58,770 --> 00:47:00,500
- I can do that.

950
00:47:00,500 --> 00:47:01,420
- Okay, fine.

951
00:47:05,950 --> 00:47:08,410
- Oh, thank you.

952
00:47:08,410 --> 00:47:09,850
- Good night, sweetheart.

953
00:47:09,850 --> 00:47:10,680
- Night.

954
00:47:13,010 --> 00:47:16,820
- Pretty nice having a
woman around, isn't it?

955
00:47:16,820 --> 00:47:18,160
- Yeah, it sure is.

956
00:47:19,350 --> 00:47:22,090
- You know, I'm surprised that
a smart woman hasn't caught

957
00:47:22,090 --> 00:47:24,850
a good looking guy like
you in all these years.

958
00:47:26,030 --> 00:47:28,510
I remember a fella I knew just like you,

959
00:47:28,510 --> 00:47:30,760
he said he was looking
for an old fashioned girl.

960
00:47:30,760 --> 00:47:32,130
I said, "Why don't you come to my house?

961
00:47:32,130 --> 00:47:35,240
"I'll introduce you to my
grandmother," ka-boom-ching.

962
00:47:38,720 --> 00:47:40,300
- What?

963
00:47:40,300 --> 00:47:44,420
- You remind me of my last
audience, and I do mean last.

964
00:47:45,700 --> 00:47:48,660
No, I was merely saying I'm surprised

965
00:47:48,660 --> 00:47:50,530
that you never married again.

966
00:47:50,530 --> 00:47:51,370
- Oh.

967
00:47:51,370 --> 00:47:52,600
- Of course it's none of my business

968
00:47:52,600 --> 00:47:56,100
but you must know some nice ladies.

969
00:47:59,430 --> 00:48:03,020
- Les, has, has Felice said
anything to you about that?

970
00:48:04,060 --> 00:48:07,260
- Well, she has said that
there's one special lady

971
00:48:07,260 --> 00:48:10,130
that's been around here
lately that she likes.

972
00:48:12,640 --> 00:48:13,730
- She said that?

973
00:48:13,730 --> 00:48:17,780
- Mm, just this morning,
as a matter of fact.

974
00:48:19,550 --> 00:48:23,070
Good night.

975
00:48:23,070 --> 00:48:24,160
- Good night.

976
00:48:26,760 --> 00:48:28,170
- There!

977
00:48:28,170 --> 00:48:29,990
Snug as a bug in a rug.

978
00:48:31,680 --> 00:48:33,680
- You believe in Santa Claus, don't you?

979
00:48:34,870 --> 00:48:35,800
- Sure I do.

980
00:48:38,240 --> 00:48:41,180
But I don't believe that Santa can make

981
00:48:41,180 --> 00:48:43,470
every wish come true all of the time.

982
00:48:44,570 --> 00:48:48,600
He's got a big job, there're
a lotta kids out there.

983
00:48:49,930 --> 00:48:50,760
- I know.

984
00:48:52,500 --> 00:48:53,330
But...

985
00:48:57,300 --> 00:48:58,440
- I love these.

986
00:49:03,120 --> 00:49:04,270
Oh, look at the family.

987
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:08,480
Looks like Vermont.

988
00:49:10,070 --> 00:49:11,740
- What's in Vermont?

989
00:49:12,660 --> 00:49:14,600
- A lot of happy memories.

990
00:49:16,080 --> 00:49:16,960
When I was a kid, we always used to

991
00:49:16,960 --> 00:49:19,670
go to Vermont to see my grandparents

992
00:49:21,470 --> 00:49:26,080
and it always snowed at
Christmas, like magic.

993
00:49:26,080 --> 00:49:26,940
- Were you happy?

994
00:49:28,760 --> 00:49:29,600
- Yeah.

995
00:49:34,260 --> 00:49:36,310
See, when I was growing up,

996
00:49:36,310 --> 00:49:40,590
my family had a lot of problems so

997
00:49:42,250 --> 00:49:46,570
Christmas in Vermont was my
favourite time of the year.

998
00:49:49,210 --> 00:49:53,730
And now, even though Grandma
and Grandpa are gone,

999
00:49:53,730 --> 00:49:55,270
I still go back there,

1000
00:49:57,300 --> 00:49:58,820
to remember the happy times.

1001
00:50:01,740 --> 00:50:02,880
- I love snow, too.

1002
00:50:04,280 --> 00:50:05,110
- Yeah.

1003
00:50:06,430 --> 00:50:09,110
But I guess it won't be snowing this year.

1004
00:50:11,970 --> 00:50:13,190
But I think you are gonna have

1005
00:50:13,190 --> 00:50:15,920
a very merry Christmas just the same.

1006
00:50:33,190 --> 00:50:34,110
Good night.

1007
00:50:42,130 --> 00:50:43,300
- Right there.

1008
00:50:47,500 --> 00:50:49,580
- Good night, sweetheart.

1009
00:51:04,800 --> 00:51:07,060
- Is everything all right?

1010
00:51:07,060 --> 00:51:08,510
- Yeah, fine, um...

1011
00:51:09,750 --> 00:51:12,680
She had a really busy day,
she oughta sleep well tonight.

1012
00:51:13,870 --> 00:51:14,700
- Sorry I missed it.

1013
00:51:14,700 --> 00:51:17,430
Here, you left this downstairs.

1014
00:51:17,430 --> 00:51:18,260
- Thank you.

1015
00:51:22,680 --> 00:51:24,430
- Some of the things I said...

1016
00:51:24,430 --> 00:51:28,710
- Look, um, there're
only two more days left

1017
00:51:28,710 --> 00:51:30,850
and then we'll be done with this story

1018
00:51:30,850 --> 00:51:32,650
that neither one of us wanted to do.

1019
00:51:34,960 --> 00:51:37,980
Excuse me, um, I have
an appointment with Les.

1020
00:51:49,090 --> 00:51:50,380
- Come in!

1021
00:51:51,820 --> 00:51:53,620
Howdy-doo!

1022
00:51:53,620 --> 00:51:55,170
Have a seat in my chair.

1023
00:51:58,460 --> 00:51:59,290
- Thank you.

1024
00:52:00,220 --> 00:52:03,190
- I, uh, I didn't have
any clips that you wanted,

1025
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:04,730
but I did have some photos.

1026
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:05,560
- Great!

1027
00:52:09,880 --> 00:52:11,390
Oh, these are terrific.

1028
00:52:12,640 --> 00:52:14,120
Look at you!

1029
00:52:14,120 --> 00:52:17,070
- Who would ever think
I'd end up as a governor?

1030
00:52:17,070 --> 00:52:18,600
- Pays the rent, right?

1031
00:52:18,600 --> 00:52:21,220
- Which is more than my hoofing was doing.

1032
00:52:21,220 --> 00:52:23,660
I had to quit the stage
because of my throat.

1033
00:52:24,890 --> 00:52:25,980
- Your throat?

1034
00:52:25,980 --> 00:52:28,080
- Yeah, the audience threatened to cut it.

1035
00:52:31,040 --> 00:52:33,760
Anyway, I like kids.

1036
00:52:34,930 --> 00:52:36,600
Do you like kids?

1037
00:52:36,600 --> 00:52:37,430
- Sure.

1038
00:52:39,420 --> 00:52:41,030
- You ever think of having kids?

1039
00:52:42,550 --> 00:52:44,900
- Well, I'm not really...

1040
00:52:44,900 --> 00:52:49,350
- Seems that you have a knack
with kids, kids like you!

1041
00:52:49,350 --> 00:52:50,330
Felice sure does.

1042
00:52:52,660 --> 00:52:54,710
- It's probably because I'm on TV.

1043
00:52:54,710 --> 00:52:57,310
- Oh, I think she'd like
you no matter what you did.

1044
00:52:59,180 --> 00:53:02,780
It's a shame, though, that
she hasn't got a mother.

1045
00:53:02,780 --> 00:53:04,810
It's a bad break, don't you think?

1046
00:53:04,810 --> 00:53:06,300
- It's a very bad break.

1047
00:53:07,980 --> 00:53:10,640
- A pretty, talented lady like you

1048
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,150
probably never had any
bad breaks like that.

1049
00:53:19,720 --> 00:53:21,140
- Oh, I had my share.

1050
00:53:22,510 --> 00:53:26,000
- [Les] So, is your story almost finished?

1051
00:53:26,000 --> 00:53:27,530
Is it going well, you think?

1052
00:53:27,530 --> 00:53:28,930
- So far, so good.

1053
00:53:28,930 --> 00:53:30,680
I don't have my ending yet, though.

1054
00:53:30,680 --> 00:53:34,360
- Oh, you have to end
it with a big finish,

1055
00:53:34,360 --> 00:53:36,970
you gotta give it everything you got!

1056
00:53:36,970 --> 00:53:39,150
Yeah, don't hold anything back,

1057
00:53:39,150 --> 00:53:41,320
that's what they used to tell me.

1058
00:53:41,320 --> 00:53:42,480
- Everything I got?

1059
00:53:44,080 --> 00:53:46,030
Les, I couldn't do that.

1060
00:53:47,570 --> 00:53:48,860
- Yes, you can, Mary.

1061
00:53:57,630 --> 00:53:59,530
- So, folks, looks like our prediction

1062
00:53:59,530 --> 00:54:01,870
for a scorcher of a Christmas still holds.

1063
00:54:01,870 --> 00:54:03,650
So make sure you wear your sunscreen

1064
00:54:03,650 --> 00:54:07,010
if you plan to go out
caroling, because there is

1065
00:54:07,010 --> 00:54:09,220
not a chance of there
bein' a white Christmas

1066
00:54:09,220 --> 00:54:12,700
within a hundred miles
of where I'm sittin'!

1067
00:54:12,700 --> 00:54:13,970
- [Dan] No snowboarding?

1068
00:54:13,970 --> 00:54:16,550
- [Weather Forecaster]
Nope, no snow, not a drop!

1069
00:54:16,550 --> 00:54:18,190
- Oh, what does he know?

1070
00:54:18,190 --> 00:54:19,120
That guy's so dumb,

1071
00:54:19,120 --> 00:54:22,370
he tried to find the zip code
for the Gettysburg Address!

1072
00:54:22,370 --> 00:54:23,610
- Ka-boom-ching!

1073
00:54:23,610 --> 00:54:24,440
- Yeah.

1074
00:54:27,010 --> 00:54:28,660
- I had a weird dream last night.

1075
00:54:29,920 --> 00:54:30,750
- What was it?

1076
00:54:32,100 --> 00:54:34,780
- I dreamed that you were Santa Claus.

1077
00:54:34,780 --> 00:54:36,280
- No!

1078
00:54:36,280 --> 00:54:37,160
Me?

1079
00:54:37,160 --> 00:54:41,260
What a crazy dream!

1080
00:54:41,260 --> 00:54:44,380
- Well, yesterday it was kinda
like you were Santa Claus.

1081
00:54:45,290 --> 00:54:47,830
I mean, you started all
those people givin' money,

1082
00:54:47,830 --> 00:54:51,280
you found Daddy's sweater,
and you seemed to know

1083
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,700
what every one of those
kids wanted for Christmas!

1084
00:54:53,700 --> 00:54:57,820
- Well, I didn't make those
things happen, it just happened!

1085
00:54:58,890 --> 00:55:00,350
- Yeah, but you made
it feel like Christmas

1086
00:55:00,350 --> 00:55:03,380
wherever you went, just like Santa Claus!

1087
00:55:03,380 --> 00:55:07,620
- Whoa now, I may've put on a few pounds,

1088
00:55:07,620 --> 00:55:10,360
but I don't have a beard,
I don't wear a red suit.

1089
00:55:10,360 --> 00:55:13,960
Now, I like Christmas a
lot, but I am not Santa!

1090
00:55:14,830 --> 00:55:17,540
- Yeah, but in my dream you
had a beard and a red suit

1091
00:55:17,540 --> 00:55:19,540
and you looked exactly like Santa Claus.

1092
00:55:20,550 --> 00:55:22,130
- If I was Santa for Christmas,

1093
00:55:22,130 --> 00:55:26,770
I'd give myself a
one-man show on Broadway!

1094
00:55:26,770 --> 00:55:28,650
- Yeah, but there was somethin' else.

1095
00:55:28,650 --> 00:55:31,870
The way you got here so fast?

1096
00:55:31,870 --> 00:55:34,090
It was like you were waitin'
outside for Daddy's call.

1097
00:55:35,700 --> 00:55:36,840
- I needed the job.

1098
00:55:39,500 --> 00:55:40,850
Hello?

1099
00:55:40,850 --> 00:55:43,790
Oh, he's not here, can I take a message?

1100
00:55:43,790 --> 00:55:44,790
Yeah, just a second.

1101
00:56:24,110 --> 00:56:27,020
Uh, you're gonna have to call back.

1102
00:56:36,150 --> 00:56:38,150
- Oh my gosh, my letter!

1103
00:56:40,620 --> 00:56:43,150
- Felice, where are ya?

1104
00:56:43,150 --> 00:56:45,250
Where are you, Felice?

1105
00:56:45,250 --> 00:56:48,610
- You are Santa Claus, you
have the letter I wrote you!

1106
00:56:48,610 --> 00:56:50,630
- Oh, whoa, whoa!

1107
00:56:50,630 --> 00:56:54,650
Now, Cookie, you're
jumpin' to conclusions.

1108
00:56:54,650 --> 00:56:56,150
- You must be, there's no other way

1109
00:56:56,150 --> 00:56:57,620
you could've got this letter!

1110
00:56:57,620 --> 00:57:00,360
- Oh, no, no, no, you know what happened?

1111
00:57:00,360 --> 00:57:03,830
The day I got here, I found this letter

1112
00:57:03,830 --> 00:57:07,400
on top of the mailbox,
I guess the postmaster

1113
00:57:07,400 --> 00:57:09,500
must've returned it, yeah.

1114
00:57:09,500 --> 00:57:13,730
So, I was gonna give it to
you and I put it in my pocket.

1115
00:57:13,730 --> 00:57:17,040
Well, listen, it's still not
too late to mail it, huh?

1116
00:57:17,910 --> 00:57:20,750
Oh, here's the problem!

1117
00:57:20,750 --> 00:57:23,750
You forgot to put down the
zip code for the North Pole!

1118
00:57:23,750 --> 00:57:27,330
So, we'll just look that
up and then we'll mail it.

1119
00:57:27,330 --> 00:57:30,870
- Our mailman doesn't come that
early, you are Santa Claus!

1120
00:57:33,220 --> 00:57:36,340
- Felice, it doesn't make sense.

1121
00:57:36,340 --> 00:57:40,260
If I was Santa Claus, I'd
be too busy making toys

1122
00:57:40,260 --> 00:57:44,280
and checking lists to be here now, right?

1123
00:57:45,460 --> 00:57:48,320
- Are you gonna bring me a mommy
like I asked in the letter?

1124
00:57:53,410 --> 00:57:54,240
- Come here.

1125
00:57:59,030 --> 00:57:59,860
Now listen.

1126
00:58:01,210 --> 00:58:03,980
A mommy isn't something
you order like a hamburger.

1127
00:58:05,270 --> 00:58:07,930
Now, you had a mom who loved you very much

1128
00:58:07,930 --> 00:58:12,290
and you still have a dad who
wants the very best for you.

1129
00:58:12,290 --> 00:58:15,720
You live in a nice house,
you go to a nice school,

1130
00:58:15,720 --> 00:58:20,250
and you got me, now that's
better than a lot of kids get.

1131
00:58:21,630 --> 00:58:25,600
- I know, but it isn't just
for me, it's for Daddy, too.

1132
00:58:32,260 --> 00:58:33,720
So if you're not Santa,

1133
00:58:33,720 --> 00:58:35,970
I'm just gonna have to
get a mommy on my own.

1134
00:58:47,970 --> 00:58:48,800
- As you can see...

1135
00:58:48,800 --> 00:58:50,170
No, no, no, just keep watching.

1136
00:58:50,170 --> 00:58:51,980
Have a gift for spreading happiness.

1137
00:58:51,980 --> 00:58:54,230
Keep watching tomorrow
night for another chapter

1138
00:58:54,230 --> 00:58:57,280
in this very special story we
call Home for the Holidays.

1139
00:58:59,180 --> 00:59:00,520
It's sweet, isn't it?

1140
00:59:00,520 --> 00:59:01,990
Katrina did a great edit!

1141
00:59:01,990 --> 00:59:03,110
- It's too soft!

1142
00:59:03,110 --> 00:59:03,990
- Too soft?

1143
00:59:03,990 --> 00:59:07,220
Mac, I thought you wanted
something that touches the heart?

1144
00:59:07,220 --> 00:59:08,500
This touches the heart!

1145
00:59:08,500 --> 00:59:10,220
- But what's the ending?

1146
00:59:10,220 --> 00:59:11,830
Mary, Duckworth is getting nervous,

1147
00:59:11,830 --> 00:59:13,500
and I have to tell you, you
don't have a lot of time

1148
00:59:13,500 --> 00:59:16,330
to redeem yourself before
your contract is up.

1149
00:59:16,330 --> 00:59:18,270
- Thanks for reminding me.

1150
00:59:18,270 --> 00:59:19,950
I'll just go someplace else.

1151
00:59:19,950 --> 00:59:22,680
- Well, it is easier to find
a job when you have a job.

1152
00:59:22,680 --> 00:59:25,500
Besides, time marches
on, maybe five years ago

1153
00:59:25,500 --> 00:59:27,160
you could pull a stunt like this.

1154
00:59:27,160 --> 00:59:29,600
- Gee, thanks!

1155
00:59:29,600 --> 00:59:32,740
- Mary, we are in the
business of selling dreams,

1156
00:59:32,740 --> 00:59:35,270
where is this dream going to end?

1157
00:59:37,030 --> 00:59:41,330
- Well, they have a very
merry Christmas, I hope.

1158
00:59:41,330 --> 00:59:43,790
- No, no, no, no, no!

1159
00:59:43,790 --> 00:59:46,510
They're going to have
the merriest Christmas

1160
00:59:46,510 --> 00:59:50,440
that anyone has ever had in
the history of Christmases!

1161
00:59:50,440 --> 00:59:52,090
They're gonna have every single one

1162
00:59:52,090 --> 00:59:54,860
of their dreams and wishes fulfilled!

1163
00:59:54,860 --> 00:59:56,380
- Who are you, Santa Claus?

1164
00:59:56,380 --> 00:59:58,210
- No, you are!

1165
00:59:58,210 --> 01:00:01,690
You're gonna get in there and
you're gonna do something.

1166
01:00:02,560 --> 01:00:06,250
Okay, what does that little
girl want for Christmas?

1167
01:00:07,250 --> 01:00:08,690
- A mother.

1168
01:00:08,690 --> 01:00:09,970
- Good!

1169
01:00:09,970 --> 01:00:11,350
Get her one.

1170
01:00:11,350 --> 01:00:12,490
- Mac, are you crazy?

1171
01:00:12,490 --> 01:00:14,810
- We have been promoting this
show like there's no tomorrow,

1172
01:00:14,810 --> 01:00:17,140
now Duckworth wants a happy ending!

1173
01:00:17,140 --> 01:00:18,100
- I can't...

1174
01:00:18,100 --> 01:00:19,010
- Eh!

1175
01:00:19,010 --> 01:00:21,640
He's going to accept nothing less!

1176
01:00:21,640 --> 01:00:25,220
Get that kid a mommy.

1177
01:00:27,600 --> 01:00:28,430
- Right.

1178
01:00:37,440 --> 01:00:40,690
At least in news I won't
have to make up the ending.

1179
01:00:40,690 --> 01:00:41,520
- You wanna bet?

1180
01:00:47,130 --> 01:00:49,170
- [Charlene] Hey
stranger, this is Charlene

1181
01:00:49,170 --> 01:00:52,910
and I sure would love to talk
to y'all but leave a message!

1182
01:00:54,550 --> 01:00:58,540
- Hi, Charlene, this is Felice
Wallace, Joel's daughter.

1183
01:00:58,540 --> 01:01:02,370
Daddy's really down in the
dumps and I think he misses you,

1184
01:01:02,370 --> 01:01:05,190
can you come by around
five on Christmas Eve?

1185
01:01:06,580 --> 01:01:08,620
I think he'd really like to see you again.

1186
01:01:08,620 --> 01:01:09,770
Hello, Maria?

1187
01:01:09,770 --> 01:01:11,840
This is Felice Wallace, Joel's daughter.

1188
01:01:12,960 --> 01:01:15,770
Daddy's really down in the
dumps and I think he misses you,

1189
01:01:15,770 --> 01:01:18,600
could you drop by around
five on Christmas Eve?

1190
01:01:18,600 --> 01:01:22,070
I think he'd really like to
see you again, thank you.

1191
01:01:22,070 --> 01:01:24,100
This is Felice Wallace, Joel's daughter.

1192
01:01:24,100 --> 01:01:25,000
- [Woman] Yes?

1193
01:01:25,000 --> 01:01:27,320
- Daddy's really down in the dumps

1194
01:01:27,320 --> 01:01:29,310
and I think he misses you,

1195
01:01:29,310 --> 01:01:32,120
can you come by around
five on Christmas Eve?

1196
01:01:33,310 --> 01:01:34,750
I think he'd really like to see you again.

1197
01:01:34,750 --> 01:01:36,280
- [Woman] Okay.

1198
01:01:36,280 --> 01:01:37,110
- Thank you.

1199
01:01:39,690 --> 01:01:41,160
- Mary?

1200
01:01:41,160 --> 01:01:42,860
Yeah, hi, it's Joel Wallace.

1201
01:01:42,860 --> 01:01:45,790
- [Mary] Hi, Joel, what's up?

1202
01:01:45,790 --> 01:01:48,240
- Um, got kind of a surprise for you,

1203
01:01:48,240 --> 01:01:49,270
think you could get your crew together

1204
01:01:49,270 --> 01:01:51,860
and stop by my house around
eight o'clock tonight?

1205
01:01:51,860 --> 01:01:52,810
- What is it?

1206
01:01:52,810 --> 01:01:54,120
- I can't tell you but I promise that

1207
01:01:54,120 --> 01:01:57,500
it will be great for your
story and you will love it.

1208
01:01:57,500 --> 01:02:00,030
- Okay, we'll be there.

1209
01:02:00,030 --> 01:02:01,580
- All right, I'll see you then.

1210
01:02:05,530 --> 01:02:08,380
- Mary Maloney, I would like
you to meet Samantha Bruce.

1211
01:02:08,380 --> 01:02:09,400
- Nice to meet you.

1212
01:02:10,670 --> 01:02:14,570
- I'd like to do a shot
that Samantha, Felice, and I

1213
01:02:14,570 --> 01:02:16,690
are all in together, can we do that?

1214
01:02:16,690 --> 01:02:18,200
- Sure!

1215
01:02:18,200 --> 01:02:19,520
- Thanks!

1216
01:02:19,520 --> 01:02:20,360
- Got that, guys?

1217
01:02:20,360 --> 01:02:21,830
- Sure.

1218
01:02:21,830 --> 01:02:22,980
Everybody's a director.

1219
01:02:23,830 --> 01:02:25,950
- Okay, rolling tape.

1220
01:02:25,950 --> 01:02:27,070
Camera's on you, Joel.

1221
01:02:27,070 --> 01:02:29,630
And three, two, one.

1222
01:02:30,840 --> 01:02:31,670
- Um...

1223
01:02:32,830 --> 01:02:35,940
Felice, I know that
you have wanted a mommy

1224
01:02:35,940 --> 01:02:38,990
for a very, very long time, in fact,

1225
01:02:38,990 --> 01:02:40,700
it's one of your biggest wishes.

1226
01:02:41,610 --> 01:02:44,020
Well, you don't have
to wish for it anymore

1227
01:02:45,250 --> 01:02:47,080
because Samantha and I are getting married

1228
01:02:47,080 --> 01:02:48,550
just as soon as possible!

1229
01:02:50,360 --> 01:02:53,780
- I'll be your new mommy!

1230
01:02:55,340 --> 01:02:57,840
- Go on, hug your, hug
your new mommy, sweetheart.

1231
01:03:01,040 --> 01:03:03,150
- Uh, kill the camera, pack it up.

1232
01:03:04,410 --> 01:03:05,550
- Wait just a second!

1233
01:03:05,550 --> 01:03:08,000
- This is a personal family moment,

1234
01:03:08,000 --> 01:03:10,750
we don't belong here, it's intrusive.

1235
01:03:10,750 --> 01:03:12,570
- I thought you said that you
wanted an uplifting story?

1236
01:03:12,570 --> 01:03:14,330
- Who cares what I want?

1237
01:03:14,330 --> 01:03:16,580
Don't you care what your daughter wants?

1238
01:03:16,580 --> 01:03:17,410
Look at her!

1239
01:03:25,850 --> 01:03:27,750
Look, I'm sorry, that was out of line.

1240
01:03:28,870 --> 01:03:29,700
I should go.

1241
01:03:34,380 --> 01:03:37,250
Felice, honey, I gotta go.

1242
01:03:37,250 --> 01:03:39,250
- Please, Mary, tuck me in tonight!

1243
01:03:43,070 --> 01:03:44,720
- Sweetheart, I think that Samantha

1244
01:03:44,720 --> 01:03:46,100
should be the one to tuck you in tonight.

1245
01:03:46,100 --> 01:03:48,060
Wouldn't you like to do that, Sam?

1246
01:03:52,210 --> 01:03:54,080
Go on, go on, sweetie.

1247
01:04:01,560 --> 01:04:04,150
- I'll be back tomorrow
night for the tree trimming.

1248
01:04:07,720 --> 01:04:09,380
Have a good evening.

1249
01:04:18,410 --> 01:04:19,380
- Good news, huh?

1250
01:04:19,380 --> 01:04:20,860
You got your happy ending.

1251
01:04:21,900 --> 01:04:23,330
- You think so?

1252
01:04:23,330 --> 01:04:26,240
- Well, Felice got her
mom, what could be better?

1253
01:04:26,240 --> 01:04:28,870
- I'm just a reporter,
how do you feel about it?

1254
01:04:28,870 --> 01:04:29,700
- Me?

1255
01:04:29,700 --> 01:04:31,750
I'm just a governor.

1256
01:04:31,750 --> 01:04:32,580
Good night, Mary.

1257
01:04:32,580 --> 01:04:33,580
- Good night.

1258
01:04:37,380 --> 01:04:38,210
- There you go.

1259
01:04:40,010 --> 01:04:41,620
Ooh!

1260
01:04:41,620 --> 01:04:43,240
Isn't this cute!

1261
01:04:43,240 --> 01:04:44,430
Looks like an antique.

1262
01:04:45,360 --> 01:04:47,110
It's probably worth a lot of money.

1263
01:04:49,850 --> 01:04:52,630
- I was hoping it would
snow for Christmas.

1264
01:04:53,670 --> 01:04:55,090
- Mm, snow.

1265
01:04:56,850 --> 01:04:57,680
You know what?

1266
01:04:57,680 --> 01:04:58,860
It just messes up the road

1267
01:04:58,860 --> 01:05:01,480
and makes it difficult to get around.

1268
01:05:08,970 --> 01:05:10,070
So tomorrow night you'll get to meet

1269
01:05:10,070 --> 01:05:11,520
your new grandma and grandpa.

1270
01:05:17,240 --> 01:05:18,660
Well, good night.

1271
01:05:24,580 --> 01:05:25,630
- Right there.

1272
01:05:39,450 --> 01:05:42,740
- Monica, let's just get set
up for the tree trimming,

1273
01:05:42,740 --> 01:05:45,150
the tea and cookies
and then get outta here

1274
01:05:45,150 --> 01:05:46,930
as soon as possible, okay?
- Absolutely.

1275
01:05:46,930 --> 01:05:47,860
- Okay by me!

1276
01:05:51,970 --> 01:05:52,800
- Stop!

1277
01:05:54,580 --> 01:05:55,700
Get a close up on those cookies,

1278
01:05:55,700 --> 01:05:57,250
I really need that cookie shot.

1279
01:05:58,210 --> 01:06:00,820
- Samantha, you don't have
to worry, you look fine.

1280
01:06:00,820 --> 01:06:02,410
You look beautiful!

1281
01:06:03,780 --> 01:06:04,980
- Have a cookie, Cookie?

1282
01:06:06,040 --> 01:06:07,390
- No, thank you.

1283
01:06:07,390 --> 01:06:09,040
- You'll like it, it's chocolate.

1284
01:06:10,060 --> 01:06:10,960
- No, thank you.

1285
01:06:12,230 --> 01:06:13,060
- Samantha?

1286
01:06:13,060 --> 01:06:15,770
- No, I can't, I'm too nervous
about being on television.

1287
01:06:15,770 --> 01:06:16,900
- Oh, sweetheart, you
don't have to be nervous,

1288
01:06:16,900 --> 01:06:18,630
there's really nothing,
there's nothing to,

1289
01:06:18,630 --> 01:06:20,730
I would like a cookie, thank you, Les.

1290
01:06:20,730 --> 01:06:21,970
There's nothing to it, right?

1291
01:06:21,970 --> 01:06:22,850
Right, Felice?

1292
01:06:27,450 --> 01:06:30,430
Look, once we've finished
trimming the tree,

1293
01:06:30,430 --> 01:06:31,840
we're all gonna get in the car,

1294
01:06:31,840 --> 01:06:33,230
we're gonna go over to Samantha's parents

1295
01:06:33,230 --> 01:06:34,890
and we're gonna have dinner.

1296
01:06:34,890 --> 01:06:35,980
What're we having?

1297
01:06:35,980 --> 01:06:37,140
- Prime rib.
- Prime rib!

1298
01:06:37,140 --> 01:06:38,950
- We always have prime rib!

1299
01:06:38,950 --> 01:06:41,350
- Ooh, that sounds yummy, doesn't it?

1300
01:06:41,350 --> 01:06:42,580
- I don't eat red meat.

1301
01:06:44,620 --> 01:06:46,910
- Exactly what do you call a hamburger?

1302
01:06:50,970 --> 01:06:51,800
- I'll get that.

1303
01:06:53,520 --> 01:06:55,160
- Thank you, Les.

1304
01:06:59,690 --> 01:07:01,700
- Hi, I'm Maria Archer,

1305
01:07:01,700 --> 01:07:03,970
I think Joel and Felice are expecting me.

1306
01:07:03,970 --> 01:07:06,490
- Yes, come on in, Merry Christmas.

1307
01:07:06,490 --> 01:07:08,620
The gifts go in the formal
dining room on the right.

1308
01:07:17,300 --> 01:07:20,770
Well, is the Wallace family expecting you?

1309
01:07:20,770 --> 01:07:22,960
- You bet, honey!

1310
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,070
I'm Charlene.

1311
01:07:24,070 --> 01:07:26,340
- Oh, Charlene, yes.

1312
01:07:26,340 --> 01:07:28,490
Well, Merry Christmas,
you all, come on in!

1313
01:07:29,630 --> 01:07:31,620
Formal dining room on the right.

1314
01:07:33,340 --> 01:07:34,170
Charlene.

1315
01:07:45,710 --> 01:07:46,580
- Hi, I'm Leslie.

1316
01:07:56,910 --> 01:07:58,740
- Come inside, ladies!

1317
01:08:00,080 --> 01:08:01,990
That's it, Merry Christmas!

1318
01:08:03,270 --> 01:08:04,310
This way.

1319
01:08:05,750 --> 01:08:07,350
Formal dining room on the right.

1320
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:19,980
- Sweetheart, Felice,
we all have to adjust.

1321
01:08:19,980 --> 01:08:22,750
There are, there are things
that we all have to do

1322
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,170
because our lives are...

1323
01:08:29,900 --> 01:08:30,730
Uh...

1324
01:08:32,290 --> 01:08:34,920
Would you excuse me for a moment?

1325
01:08:42,890 --> 01:08:45,890
- Um, would you excuse me a moment?

1326
01:08:55,690 --> 01:08:59,400
- [Woman] I haven't seen him in so long.

1327
01:08:59,400 --> 01:09:02,890
- Well, Merry Christmas, Joel, honey!

1328
01:09:02,890 --> 01:09:05,180
How's that adorable
little daughter of yours?

1329
01:09:05,180 --> 01:09:08,310
She's just fine, Charlene, thank you.

1330
01:09:19,810 --> 01:09:22,730
- Could you excuse me for a moment?

1331
01:09:25,900 --> 01:09:27,080
- Mary Maloney,

1332
01:09:29,830 --> 01:09:31,030
ladies and gentlemen.

1333
01:09:58,180 --> 01:10:02,460
Uh, I wanna wish you all
a very Merry Christmas,

1334
01:10:02,460 --> 01:10:04,010
I'm delighted that you're here.

1335
01:10:05,140 --> 01:10:10,140
I want to introduce you to
Samantha Bruce, my fiancé.

1336
01:10:13,540 --> 01:10:15,780
- What kind of a joke is this?

1337
01:10:15,780 --> 01:10:17,030
- It's not a joke, Maria.

1338
01:10:19,930 --> 01:10:20,760
What...

1339
01:10:23,310 --> 01:10:25,960
- Well, bah and humbug, darling.

1340
01:10:27,310 --> 01:10:28,140
- Charlene.

1341
01:10:36,000 --> 01:10:37,350
- Nice goin'.

1342
01:10:37,350 --> 01:10:38,570
- See ya, Leslie.

1343
01:10:41,100 --> 01:10:44,020
- No, Joel, I would very
much like to know what the,

1344
01:10:44,020 --> 01:10:45,890
what was that all about?

1345
01:10:45,890 --> 01:10:47,720
- Excuse me, I'm sure that you two

1346
01:10:47,720 --> 01:10:49,130
have things you'd like to discuss,

1347
01:10:49,130 --> 01:10:52,110
but I've got a crew that has
other plans for the night.

1348
01:10:52,110 --> 01:10:53,710
Can we get to the tree trimming soon?

1349
01:10:53,710 --> 01:10:54,850
- Yeah, we're gonna get
to it in just a minute,

1350
01:10:54,850 --> 01:10:58,260
but first there's someone
I really need to talk to.

1351
01:10:58,260 --> 01:11:00,450
Tell me exactly what you did.

1352
01:11:00,450 --> 01:11:02,870
- I called all the women you dated.

1353
01:11:02,870 --> 01:11:04,750
It was before you were engaged, Dad,

1354
01:11:04,750 --> 01:11:06,210
I was trying to help you.

1355
01:11:06,210 --> 01:11:07,330
- First of all, sweetheart,

1356
01:11:07,330 --> 01:11:09,460
I did not date all of those women,

1357
01:11:09,460 --> 01:11:12,630
and secondly, how could
this possible help me?

1358
01:11:12,630 --> 01:11:15,440
- Well, I'd get a mom
and you'd get a wife!

1359
01:11:18,270 --> 01:11:19,940
- Sweetheart, don't you think that

1360
01:11:19,940 --> 01:11:23,080
I should be able to pick out my own wife?

1361
01:11:23,080 --> 01:11:26,940
- You never have in
all these years, I was,

1362
01:11:26,940 --> 01:11:29,050
I was just trying to help you!

1363
01:11:29,050 --> 01:11:31,260
That's why I wanted us on TV,

1364
01:11:31,260 --> 01:11:33,950
so maybe some nice lady would see us.

1365
01:11:33,950 --> 01:11:36,680
Then, then I thought of
calling all your girlfriends.

1366
01:11:36,680 --> 01:11:40,850
- Felice, you called every
woman's name in my work book.

1367
01:11:41,990 --> 01:11:46,580
Felice, Leslie is my
dentist, come on, sweetie!

1368
01:11:47,890 --> 01:11:50,040
- I didn't think that
they'd all come, Dad.

1369
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:54,260
- Don't you think that
maybe you should've asked me

1370
01:11:54,260 --> 01:11:55,930
how I felt about it, first?

1371
01:11:57,420 --> 01:11:59,410
- Don't you think that
maybe you should've asked me

1372
01:11:59,410 --> 01:12:01,460
how I felt about Samantha first?

1373
01:12:06,000 --> 01:12:08,440
- Well, maybe, maybe I should have but...

1374
01:12:10,670 --> 01:12:13,390
Felice, I heard that you
wanted a mommy for Christmas,

1375
01:12:13,390 --> 01:12:15,200
I thought I was doing the right thing.

1376
01:12:15,200 --> 01:12:16,300
- Les told you?

1377
01:12:16,300 --> 01:12:20,310
- No, Les didn't tell me,
I just, I just found out.

1378
01:12:24,650 --> 01:12:25,490
Look.

1379
01:12:28,020 --> 01:12:33,020
I have held onto your mommy
for a very, very long time

1380
01:12:34,640 --> 01:12:38,390
and it was really selfish of me

1381
01:12:38,390 --> 01:12:43,390
because you need a real, live
mommy, not just a memory.

1382
01:12:43,800 --> 01:12:46,640
So I asked Samantha to
marry me because I think

1383
01:12:46,640 --> 01:12:49,560
she'll make a terrific mommy
and I thought you'd be happy.

1384
01:12:50,760 --> 01:12:51,710
- Do you love her?

1385
01:12:56,420 --> 01:12:59,220
'Cause if you don't then she
wouldn't make a good mommy.

1386
01:13:06,010 --> 01:13:08,410
- We have a TV crew
waiting for us downstairs.

1387
01:13:17,720 --> 01:13:19,650
- Merry Christmas from the Wallace house

1388
01:13:19,650 --> 01:13:21,460
where dreams have come true

1389
01:13:21,460 --> 01:13:24,880
in a surprising conclusion
to this holiday story.

1390
01:13:24,880 --> 01:13:27,640
Over the last few days
we've gotten to know

1391
01:13:27,640 --> 01:13:29,640
Joel Wallace, his daughter Felice,

1392
01:13:29,640 --> 01:13:32,560
and their very special
governor, Les Turner.

1393
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:35,020
Today, we're going to
meet a soon-to-be member

1394
01:13:35,020 --> 01:13:37,680
of the family, Samantha Bruce,

1395
01:13:37,680 --> 01:13:40,680
whose engagement to Joel
has just been announced.

1396
01:13:42,370 --> 01:13:43,980
All right, cut.

1397
01:13:43,980 --> 01:13:45,890
That's it for the stand
up, now all we have left

1398
01:13:45,890 --> 01:13:47,940
are the beauty shots of the tree trimming

1399
01:13:48,800 --> 01:13:50,650
and then we get to go home, let's go.

1400
01:13:52,130 --> 01:13:53,010
- You too, Les.

1401
01:13:53,010 --> 01:13:57,100
- Uh, maybe this should
just be for the family, huh?

1402
01:13:59,080 --> 01:14:01,500
- Okay, we'll start with the family.

1403
01:14:14,210 --> 01:14:16,560
- I think they need your
help to trim the tree.

1404
01:14:20,660 --> 01:14:21,490
- Okay.

1405
01:14:24,160 --> 01:14:28,840
You know, I'm kinda glad you're
not Santa Claus after all.

1406
01:14:29,690 --> 01:14:30,520
- You are?

1407
01:14:31,900 --> 01:14:32,730
- Well...

1408
01:14:35,110 --> 01:14:38,170
I'd hate to think Santa would
mess things up so badly.

1409
01:14:50,070 --> 01:14:53,250
- And now, for the piece de resistance,

1410
01:14:53,250 --> 01:14:56,930
this star was given to
Felice by her mother

1411
01:14:56,930 --> 01:14:58,540
just before she left us.

1412
01:14:59,810 --> 01:15:03,060
This year I think that it's only right

1413
01:15:03,060 --> 01:15:06,360
if Samantha should put the star

1414
01:15:06,360 --> 01:15:09,550
on top of the Wallace
family Christmas tree.

1415
01:15:23,710 --> 01:15:24,540
- Mary!

1416
01:15:24,540 --> 01:15:25,470
Somebody help!

1417
01:15:25,470 --> 01:15:26,430
- Mary?

1418
01:15:26,430 --> 01:15:27,260
Mary?

1419
01:15:27,260 --> 01:15:28,260
- Mary?
- Can you hear us?

1420
01:15:28,260 --> 01:15:30,230
- Somebody get help!
- Mary?

1421
01:15:33,060 --> 01:15:34,110
- Are you sure you're okay?

1422
01:15:34,110 --> 01:15:38,230
- I'm fine, I think I forgot
to eat lunch, that's all.

1423
01:15:38,230 --> 01:15:40,860
Um, why don't you guys take off

1424
01:15:40,860 --> 01:15:43,060
and I'll meet you in the van?

1425
01:15:44,040 --> 01:15:48,050
I just, uh, I need to speak
with Joel alone, please.

1426
01:15:48,890 --> 01:15:50,180
- Joel?

1427
01:15:50,180 --> 01:15:52,850
- It's all right, sweetheart,
I'll just be a few minutes.

1428
01:15:54,640 --> 01:15:58,430
- Hey, I think you really
oughta take it easy.

1429
01:15:58,430 --> 01:16:01,060
I can call someone...
- No, I'm, I'm fine, really.

1430
01:16:01,060 --> 01:16:04,760
But I need to ask you a
really blunt question.

1431
01:16:06,490 --> 01:16:08,620
Why didn't you tell me Felice was adopted?

1432
01:16:11,460 --> 01:16:14,100
- Why would you ask something like that?

1433
01:16:14,100 --> 01:16:16,670
- Because your wife
didn't give her that star.

1434
01:16:18,760 --> 01:16:19,590
- Of course she did.

1435
01:16:19,590 --> 01:16:22,900
- Her birth mother gave it to her

1436
01:16:22,900 --> 01:16:26,590
and when you adopted her,
the star came with her.

1437
01:16:28,460 --> 01:16:31,260
- Boy, you reporters really
do your homework, don't you?

1438
01:16:32,550 --> 01:16:34,010
Who told you that?

1439
01:16:34,010 --> 01:16:35,210
- No one had to tell me.

1440
01:16:40,900 --> 01:16:42,000
- What are you saying?

1441
01:16:46,730 --> 01:16:48,360
- Nine years ago,

1442
01:16:49,720 --> 01:16:53,920
I had to make the most
difficult decision of my life.

1443
01:16:54,900 --> 01:16:59,450
I made a string of really bad choices

1444
01:16:59,450 --> 01:17:02,600
but I was trying to do the right thing.

1445
01:17:05,890 --> 01:17:09,090
That star, my grandfather made that star,

1446
01:17:10,320 --> 01:17:12,900
and he gave it to my
mother, who gave it to me,

1447
01:17:14,880 --> 01:17:16,680
and I gave it to my baby girl

1448
01:17:16,680 --> 01:17:19,080
the day that I said
good-bye to her.

1449
01:17:19,950 --> 01:17:22,400
I couldn't take care of her!

1450
01:17:25,020 --> 01:17:27,890
- How did you find my daughter?

1451
01:17:27,890 --> 01:17:30,990
- I wasn't looking, I swear!

1452
01:17:32,580 --> 01:17:35,170
It was purely by chance that my boss

1453
01:17:35,170 --> 01:17:37,910
picked her letter out of the pile!

1454
01:17:37,910 --> 01:17:38,740
- Oh, come on!

1455
01:17:38,740 --> 01:17:41,390
- He opened her letter and
he assigned me the story!

1456
01:17:41,390 --> 01:17:43,240
- You expect me to believe
that out of the thousands

1457
01:17:43,240 --> 01:17:46,130
of letters to Santa, that
you found Felice's letter?

1458
01:17:46,130 --> 01:17:46,960
Come on!

1459
01:17:46,960 --> 01:17:47,900
- I, I...

1460
01:17:47,900 --> 01:17:50,910
It's crazy, I know, but there's no way

1461
01:17:50,910 --> 01:17:53,130
I could've known that it was her, I mean,

1462
01:17:53,130 --> 01:17:55,870
if she had told me she was
adopted maybe I could've...

1463
01:17:58,170 --> 01:17:59,120
She doesn't know?

1464
01:18:00,390 --> 01:18:01,340
- She doesn't know.

1465
01:18:02,760 --> 01:18:06,680
And I know that that's
wrong but I could never seem

1466
01:18:06,680 --> 01:18:09,750
to be able to find the
right moment to tell her

1467
01:18:09,750 --> 01:18:11,710
and she was way too young
anyway when he mother died

1468
01:18:11,710 --> 01:18:13,250
to really understand anything.

1469
01:18:14,410 --> 01:18:18,430
And I wanted to tell her all about you,

1470
01:18:19,770 --> 01:18:20,910
but I thought that would be like

1471
01:18:20,910 --> 01:18:22,640
losing two mommies instead of just one,

1472
01:18:22,640 --> 01:18:26,630
that would be way too much
for a little girl to handle.

1473
01:18:31,060 --> 01:18:33,010
Or maybe it was just too
much for me to handle

1474
01:18:33,010 --> 01:18:35,970
but now that she's older,

1475
01:18:35,970 --> 01:18:38,700
I can't seem to tell her much of anything

1476
01:18:38,700 --> 01:18:40,160
about that time at all.

1477
01:18:41,290 --> 01:18:43,670
But you gotta understand,
keeping this secret so long

1478
01:18:43,670 --> 01:18:47,040
has been so very difficult
and I don't want anyone...

1479
01:18:47,040 --> 01:18:49,090
- All I wanted to know

1480
01:18:50,700 --> 01:18:52,540
was that I hadn't made a mistake,

1481
01:18:58,250 --> 01:19:03,250
and that my baby girl
was loved and wanted.

1482
01:19:06,800 --> 01:19:08,200
- Let me tell you something.

1483
01:19:11,610 --> 01:19:16,010
I love my daughter more
than anything in the world.

1484
01:19:16,010 --> 01:19:19,180
- Joel, we need to get, to get going.

1485
01:19:22,520 --> 01:19:26,190
Joel we need to leave now, Mommy
and Daddy are expecting us.

1486
01:19:26,190 --> 01:19:28,890
Now, you got rid of those
other women, get rid of her.

1487
01:19:32,340 --> 01:19:33,540
- I'll go.

1488
01:19:33,540 --> 01:19:35,030
- I'm very sorry, Samantha,

1489
01:19:38,750 --> 01:19:40,550
but something important has come up.

1490
01:19:42,950 --> 01:19:44,200
- More important than me?

1491
01:19:51,230 --> 01:19:52,060
I see.

1492
01:19:54,910 --> 01:19:56,760
Well, Merry Christmas to you both.

1493
01:20:12,480 --> 01:20:16,000
- Well, there goes that story.

1494
01:20:16,000 --> 01:20:17,350
- Ah, you know Mary,

1495
01:20:17,350 --> 01:20:19,850
she'll use her magic touch
and get a happy ending.

1496
01:20:27,540 --> 01:20:28,370
- Oh no!

1497
01:20:30,010 --> 01:20:30,840
- What's wrong?

1498
01:20:33,250 --> 01:20:37,050
- I just remembered, I don't
have my car, Joel picked me up.

1499
01:20:37,050 --> 01:20:39,220
- Oh, can I give you a ride somewhere?

1500
01:20:40,410 --> 01:20:41,810
- Yeah, that would be great.

1501
01:20:43,060 --> 01:20:44,610
In fact, if you don't have dinner plans,

1502
01:20:44,610 --> 01:20:46,870
you're welcome to join me and my family.

1503
01:20:46,870 --> 01:20:49,250
It's 45 miles but they're
serving prime rib.

1504
01:20:50,640 --> 01:20:53,510
- Dinner with Mom and Dad is so my style!

1505
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:55,520
I'm Hal.

1506
01:20:55,520 --> 01:20:56,350
- I know.

1507
01:20:57,490 --> 01:20:58,320
Samantha.

1508
01:21:00,200 --> 01:21:01,030
- I know.

1509
01:21:01,880 --> 01:21:03,610
- Les, where are you?

1510
01:21:09,460 --> 01:21:10,290
Les?

1511
01:21:13,630 --> 01:21:14,900
Where are you going?

1512
01:21:14,900 --> 01:21:18,950
- Sorry, Cookie, I have to
leave, I have a deadline to meet.

1513
01:21:20,640 --> 01:21:23,790
- But you can't go,
who'll take care of me?

1514
01:21:23,790 --> 01:21:26,230
- Don't you worry, you
won't need me anymore,

1515
01:21:26,230 --> 01:21:28,250
you can trust me on that.

1516
01:21:28,250 --> 01:21:30,960
- But you can't leave
me here with Samantha!

1517
01:21:30,960 --> 01:21:33,810
- And you don't have to worry
about Samantha anymore either,

1518
01:21:33,810 --> 01:21:36,350
you can trust me on that, too!

1519
01:21:36,350 --> 01:21:37,180
- Trust you?

1520
01:21:39,190 --> 01:21:40,520
I can't trust you at all.

1521
01:21:42,240 --> 01:21:43,490
You're runnin' out on me!

1522
01:21:45,950 --> 01:21:50,310
You're no Santa, you're just
an old song and dance man.

1523
01:21:50,310 --> 01:21:51,520
You're a big flop!

1524
01:21:53,990 --> 01:21:55,190
- Like I said all along.

1525
01:22:02,890 --> 01:22:04,800
I want you to give this to your dad,

1526
01:22:04,800 --> 01:22:07,230
it's something he's always wanted.

1527
01:22:10,180 --> 01:22:12,460
- Don't you have a present for me?

1528
01:22:14,240 --> 01:22:15,460
- It's on its way.

1529
01:22:19,990 --> 01:22:22,300
I'm sorry, Felice, but it's time for me

1530
01:22:22,300 --> 01:22:23,900
to shuffle off to Buffalo.

1531
01:22:28,710 --> 01:22:29,770
Merry Christmas.

1532
01:22:38,670 --> 01:22:39,790
I love you, Cookie.

1533
01:22:44,550 --> 01:22:46,210
- Les.

1534
01:22:46,210 --> 01:22:47,310
Les, come back!

1535
01:22:53,900 --> 01:22:55,330
Les, don't...

1536
01:22:55,330 --> 01:22:56,660
- [Joel] Felice?

1537
01:22:57,760 --> 01:22:58,940
- He's gone!

1538
01:22:58,940 --> 01:23:01,870
- Sweetheart...
- Felice, what happened honey?

1539
01:23:01,870 --> 01:23:03,030
- He's gone.
- Who?

1540
01:23:03,030 --> 01:23:05,530
- Les is gone!
- He didn't just disappear,

1541
01:23:05,530 --> 01:23:06,490
listen...
- He took his suitcase

1542
01:23:06,490 --> 01:23:09,300
and said good-bye, make him
come back, Daddy, please!

1543
01:23:09,300 --> 01:23:11,140
- Sweetheart, I can't make him come back

1544
01:23:11,140 --> 01:23:12,630
if he doesn't wanna be here.

1545
01:23:13,510 --> 01:23:14,340
Here.

1546
01:23:17,260 --> 01:23:18,750
There's something...

1547
01:23:18,750 --> 01:23:19,780
- I should go.

1548
01:23:19,780 --> 01:23:20,620
- No, I...

1549
01:23:22,470 --> 01:23:23,420
I want you to stay.

1550
01:23:28,710 --> 01:23:33,110
Felice, you know that I love you

1551
01:23:33,110 --> 01:23:36,540
more than any daddy's
loved his daughter, right?

1552
01:23:37,800 --> 01:23:38,630
- Mm-hmm.

1553
01:23:39,600 --> 01:23:41,210
- Sweetheart, there's
something I should've told you

1554
01:23:41,210 --> 01:23:42,430
a very long time ago.

1555
01:23:44,870 --> 01:23:46,470
Your mommy and I adopted you

1556
01:23:46,470 --> 01:23:48,960
when you were a very little baby girl.

1557
01:23:51,730 --> 01:23:53,760
And your mother loved you so much,

1558
01:23:55,890 --> 01:24:00,570
but you had another mommy
who loved you very much, too.

1559
01:24:00,570 --> 01:24:03,410
In fact, she loved you so
much that when she realized

1560
01:24:03,410 --> 01:24:05,020
she couldn't take care of you,

1561
01:24:06,870 --> 01:24:09,080
she found another mommy
and daddy who could.

1562
01:24:14,240 --> 01:24:15,390
I want you to meet her.

1563
01:24:31,220 --> 01:24:32,710
- He did it!

1564
01:24:32,710 --> 01:24:34,600
He is Santa Claus!

1565
01:24:34,600 --> 01:24:36,660
I wrote a letter to Santa asking for a mom

1566
01:24:36,660 --> 01:24:38,100
and now it's come true!

1567
01:24:38,100 --> 01:24:40,270
- You know what, Felice?

1568
01:24:40,270 --> 01:24:42,740
I wrote a letter to Santa about you!

1569
01:24:43,770 --> 01:24:44,610
- You did?

1570
01:24:45,530 --> 01:24:46,360
- Mm-hmm.

1571
01:24:49,510 --> 01:24:50,790
- Oh!

1572
01:24:50,790 --> 01:24:51,630
Come on!

1573
01:25:01,550 --> 01:25:02,390
Wait here.

1574
01:25:08,520 --> 01:25:10,520
He had 'em all the time.

1575
01:25:11,940 --> 01:25:14,840
My letter and yours!

1576
01:25:17,960 --> 01:25:20,400
- This is the letter I wrote on the air.

1577
01:25:27,210 --> 01:25:28,340
You read it, Felice.

1578
01:25:31,170 --> 01:25:32,000
- Okay.

1579
01:25:33,260 --> 01:25:37,080
"Dear Santa, all I want for Christmas

1580
01:25:37,080 --> 01:25:39,370
"is to know that my little girl is happy."

1581
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,180
I'm happy now, Mommy.

1582
01:25:50,180 --> 01:25:51,910
- Me too, sweetie.

1583
01:25:51,910 --> 01:25:52,750
- Oh!

1584
01:25:55,070 --> 01:25:56,470
He left this for you, Daddy.

1585
01:26:18,720 --> 01:26:20,770
- This is a Mickey Mantle baseball glove.

1586
01:26:21,940 --> 01:26:24,090
I had one when I was
10-years-old, but I lost it,

1587
01:26:24,090 --> 01:26:28,620
it was my most prized possession.

1588
01:26:28,620 --> 01:26:29,550
How did he know?

1589
01:26:39,860 --> 01:26:42,110
- Wow, look at the star!
- Felice!

1590
01:26:42,110 --> 01:26:46,030
- It's back together again!
- Les couldn't be...

1591
01:26:48,420 --> 01:26:50,070
- I told you!

1592
01:26:50,070 --> 01:26:50,900
- Merry Christmas.

1593
01:26:57,160 --> 01:26:59,520
- Oh my gosh, look!

1594
01:26:59,520 --> 01:27:02,560
- [Joel] Look at what, sweetheart?

1595
01:27:02,560 --> 01:27:03,750

1596
01:27:03,750 --> 01:27:05,260
- [Joel] Okay, I'm comin'!

1597
01:27:05,260 --> 01:27:07,840

1601
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:35,540
- Wow, he did everything!
- Yes, he did.

1602
01:27:42,350 --> 01:27:44,260
- Oh, spin, sweetheart!

1603
01:27:46,320 --> 01:27:47,150
Oh!

1604
01:27:48,640 --> 01:27:49,980
Merry Christmas!

1605
01:27:51,000 --> 01:27:53,000
