1
00:00:25,692 --> 00:00:28,278
Senator! Now, if...

2
00:00:28,487 --> 00:00:33,575
Life is a beating.
All right?

3
00:00:33,784 --> 00:00:36,078
And the sooner you
understand that, the better.

4
00:00:36,286 --> 00:00:37,663
Hit it.

5
00:00:56,598 --> 00:01:00,102
You're the dog Walker?
I'm really sorry.

6
00:01:00,310 --> 00:01:01,311
She's a Pomeranian, Paul,

7
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:02,896
a show dog.

8
00:01:03,105 --> 00:01:05,774
That's $14,000 you let just
walk off down the street

9
00:01:05,983 --> 00:01:07,317
on Melrose.

10
00:01:07,526 --> 00:01:09,987
Did you say Melrose?

11
00:01:10,195 --> 00:01:11,572
Awesome. Thanks, Spencer.
It was really nice.

12
00:01:11,780 --> 00:01:13,323
Great.
Sorry to keep you waiting.

13
00:01:13,532 --> 00:01:16,410
No worries. Thanks, guys.
Nice to meet you guys.

14
00:01:16,618 --> 00:01:18,954
Oh, can we just get you
to slate one more time?

15
00:01:19,162 --> 00:01:20,455
Oh, sure.

16
00:01:20,664 --> 00:01:23,500
Uh, Spencer...
Camera.

17
00:01:23,709 --> 00:01:25,711
Spencer Kaminski.

18
00:01:25,919 --> 00:01:27,337
And to the side.

19
00:01:27,546 --> 00:01:31,133
And should I say it again?
No.

20
00:01:32,926 --> 00:01:34,052
Okay, back to camera.

21
00:01:37,389 --> 00:01:39,057
And your name one more time.

22
00:01:40,851 --> 00:01:44,021
Spencer Kaminski.

23
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:45,022
Okay, thank you.

24
00:01:45,230 --> 00:01:46,982
Great. Thanks, guys.

25
00:01:49,443 --> 00:01:50,736
Okay, we have one more.
Right?

26
00:02:13,592 --> 00:02:15,260
Hey, Betsy,
this is Spencer Kaminski.

27
00:02:15,469 --> 00:02:19,473
I'm just calling to see
if you've heard anything yet.

28
00:02:19,681 --> 00:02:23,685
Obviously I do know
that it is 5:00 A.M. in L.A.

29
00:02:23,894 --> 00:02:25,270
And I apologize.

30
00:02:25,479 --> 00:02:27,564
I just... yeah,
I had to pop back to New York,

31
00:02:27,773 --> 00:02:28,899
actually,
for a quick second today,

32
00:02:29,107 --> 00:02:30,817
but I will be back
in L.A. tomorrow.

33
00:02:31,026 --> 00:02:32,361
I'm taking the red eye
flight back tonight.

34
00:02:32,569 --> 00:02:35,697
Uh, just taking care of
a few obligations today,

35
00:02:35,906 --> 00:02:37,532
but I'm good to go
for a callback

36
00:02:37,741 --> 00:02:38,742
if I should get a callback.

37
00:02:38,950 --> 00:02:40,118
I think the audition went well,

38
00:02:40,327 --> 00:02:41,244
so we'll see.

39
00:02:41,453 --> 00:02:42,704
Anyway, so, call me back, Betsy.

40
00:02:42,913 --> 00:02:44,831
Oh, this is Spencer Kaminski,
by the way.

41
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:50,462
Oh, when the saints R.

42
00:02:57,052 --> 00:03:01,348
Yes, I want to be M...
that number R.

43
00:03:19,491 --> 00:03:20,742
Hey.
Hey, man.

44
00:03:20,951 --> 00:03:23,120
Good to see you. Hi.

45
00:03:23,328 --> 00:03:25,664
Nice jacket.
Thanks.

46
00:03:36,842 --> 00:03:39,594
Oh, that's the new steakhouse.

47
00:03:39,803 --> 00:03:41,638
Did you hear about that?
It's great.

48
00:03:41,847 --> 00:03:44,474
When you go in, it's like
you're in Paris or something.

49
00:03:44,683 --> 00:03:48,019
Paris. Wow, that sounds...
That sounds great.

50
00:03:52,566 --> 00:03:55,527
So my 4:15 got moved to 4:45,

51
00:03:55,736 --> 00:03:58,739
so we're just gonna have to
hustle after Dr. Kaplan.

52
00:03:58,947 --> 00:04:01,575
Four... okay, 4:45.

53
00:04:01,783 --> 00:04:05,328
4:45 P.M.?

54
00:04:05,537 --> 00:04:06,913
Jay, did you...

55
00:04:07,122 --> 00:04:09,583
Did you take a look at
the itinerary I sent you?

56
00:04:09,791 --> 00:04:11,126
As in the email?

57
00:04:11,334 --> 00:04:12,711
It was attached
to the email, yeah.

58
00:04:12,919 --> 00:04:16,923
Um, I did click on it,
and I think I, like...

59
00:04:17,132 --> 00:04:19,760
It got covered another window,
and then I tried to find it,

60
00:04:19,968 --> 00:04:21,011
and it got moved.

61
00:04:21,219 --> 00:04:22,387
It's okay.
It's fine. It's fine.

62
00:04:22,596 --> 00:04:24,347
I printed you a copy.

63
00:04:24,556 --> 00:04:25,724
There you go.
Okay?

64
00:04:25,932 --> 00:04:27,309
So for Dr. Suzuki,

65
00:04:27,517 --> 00:04:29,603
Mapquest says it's faster
if we cut through town

66
00:04:29,811 --> 00:04:31,772
and then go up Ravensdale.
What do you think?

67
00:04:31,980 --> 00:04:34,191
Uh, these are all
doctor's appointments?

68
00:04:36,485 --> 00:04:38,862
Jay, did you not read
the email that I sent you?

69
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,363
No, I-l read it.

70
00:04:40,572 --> 00:04:42,073
I just... the attachment,
it like, opened,

71
00:04:42,282 --> 00:04:43,617
and then I couldn't find it.

72
00:04:43,825 --> 00:04:45,952
Okay, I have five doctor's
appointments today.

73
00:04:46,161 --> 00:04:47,871
Can you take me
to five doctor's appointments?

74
00:04:49,581 --> 00:04:51,333
Yeah, sure.

75
00:04:51,541 --> 00:04:52,626
Okay, great.

76
00:04:52,834 --> 00:04:55,712
It's just, um,
it is a school day.

77
00:04:55,921 --> 00:04:57,631
Oh, shit, I forgot about that.

78
00:04:57,839 --> 00:05:00,592
No, it's fine. I just have to
Gd back there at some point

79
00:05:00,801 --> 00:05:03,470
because it's, like, my job.
You know?

80
00:05:03,678 --> 00:05:06,723
But... yeah, it's fine.

81
00:05:06,932 --> 00:05:10,936
I... I mean,
I'm just happy to see you.

82
00:05:11,144 --> 00:05:13,939
Thanks, brother.

83
00:05:14,147 --> 00:05:15,816
Sorry.

84
00:05:16,024 --> 00:05:17,275
Sorry about that.

85
00:05:52,185 --> 00:05:55,897
So, Spencer, you don't have, like,
different doctors in California?

86
00:05:56,106 --> 00:05:57,983
What do you mean?

87
00:05:58,191 --> 00:06:01,611
Like, why couldn't you just go to
the doctors they have out there?

88
00:06:05,031 --> 00:06:06,533
These are my doctors.

89
00:06:07,784 --> 00:06:10,203
I trust them.
They trust me.

90
00:06:10,412 --> 00:06:12,372
It's a whole thing.
You don't mess with that.

91
00:06:18,712 --> 00:06:20,505
Spencer...
Hmm.

92
00:06:20,714 --> 00:06:23,341
So, California.

93
00:06:23,550 --> 00:06:27,304
Right? Do you go to the beach,
like, every day?

94
00:06:27,512 --> 00:06:29,472
No, not a lot of time
for the beach.

95
00:06:29,681 --> 00:06:32,767
The last six months has been
a lot of, like,

96
00:06:32,976 --> 00:06:34,853
figuring out how to roll out
the next thing.

97
00:06:35,061 --> 00:06:36,229
You know?

98
00:06:38,857 --> 00:06:42,485
Have you not seen
"the fucked up brother-in-law?"

99
00:06:42,694 --> 00:06:44,029
It's a... it's a video?

100
00:06:44,237 --> 00:06:45,447
Yeah, it's a video.
It went super-viral.

101
00:06:45,655 --> 00:06:47,115
Everyone was sharing it.
You didn't see it?

102
00:06:47,324 --> 00:06:49,284
No, I had to get rid
of my Internet stuff

103
00:06:49,492 --> 00:06:50,577
'cause one of my students
kept posting...

104
00:06:50,785 --> 00:06:52,120
Here, I can just pull it up
for you.

105
00:06:52,329 --> 00:06:53,955
Yeah, I mean, basically,

106
00:06:54,164 --> 00:06:55,957
it's just me as this girl's
brother-in-law, you know.

107
00:06:56,166 --> 00:06:58,376
I show up at Thanksgiving. I'm
doing all kinds cf crazy shit.

108
00:06:58,585 --> 00:07:00,253
I don't know.
It's funny. You gotta see it.

109
00:07:00,462 --> 00:07:01,922
But it's initially what got me
my agent, Betsy.

110
00:07:02,130 --> 00:07:03,340
Betsy?
Yeah, and she's been,

111
00:07:03,548 --> 00:07:05,216
you know, sending me out
on these auditions,

112
00:07:05,425 --> 00:07:07,260
and I actually auditioned
for a pilot.

113
00:07:07,469 --> 00:07:09,054
Um... I'm waiting
to hear about...

114
00:07:09,262 --> 00:07:10,472
Supposed to hear about it today.

115
00:07:10,680 --> 00:07:11,640
Wow, congratulations"

116
00:07:11,848 --> 00:07:13,141
yeah, it's this ABC sitcom.

117
00:07:13,350 --> 00:07:14,601
It's about dog walkers.

118
00:07:14,809 --> 00:07:16,478
I'll be playing a...
Playing a dog Walker.

119
00:07:16,686 --> 00:07:18,271
It's a good role.
It's a... it's a great role

120
00:07:18,480 --> 00:07:20,023
'cause he, like, you know,
he loves the dogs,

121
00:07:20,231 --> 00:07:23,485
but he's conflicted about it,
and, you know...

122
00:07:23,693 --> 00:07:25,070
Hey, speaking of dogs,

123
00:07:25,278 --> 00:07:26,655
you wanna hear a funny story?

124
00:07:26,863 --> 00:07:28,156
Sure.

125
00:07:28,365 --> 00:07:30,492
I was walking on Ravensdale
the other day,

126
00:07:30,700 --> 00:07:32,702
like where Ravensdale hits
the library,

127
00:07:32,911 --> 00:07:34,204
and all of a sudden I realized

128
00:07:34,412 --> 00:07:35,914
there was this little dog
next to me.

129
00:07:36,122 --> 00:07:38,041
No collar, no leash, nothing,

130
00:07:38,249 --> 00:07:39,918
so I just looked at him,
and I was, like,

131
00:07:40,126 --> 00:07:42,253
"hello, Mr. dog.

132
00:07:42,462 --> 00:07:43,588
How are you doing?"

133
00:07:43,797 --> 00:07:45,507
As it's looking up at me.

134
00:07:45,715 --> 00:07:48,009
I was, like,
literally talking to a dog.

135
00:07:52,055 --> 00:07:54,224
Mr. kaminski?

136
00:07:54,432 --> 00:07:56,518
Here, man. Watch
"the fucked up brother-in-law."

137
00:08:05,860 --> 00:08:08,405
Get down, motherfuckers.
We're doing body shots.

138
00:08:08,613 --> 00:08:11,074
S-sorry. I just...
get down, motherfuckers.

139
00:08:11,282 --> 00:08:13,910
I don't know how to...
Fuck, fuck, fuck...

140
00:08:14,119 --> 00:08:15,537
Anybody mind if I twerk in here?

141
00:08:22,127 --> 00:08:23,545
Hello, Spencer.

142
00:08:23,753 --> 00:08:25,630
Nice to see you again.

143
00:08:25,839 --> 00:08:31,052
Your father's told us all about
your big Hollywood career.

144
00:08:31,261 --> 00:08:34,514
Seems we haven't seen you
in a few years.

145
00:08:34,723 --> 00:08:35,598
Yep.

146
00:08:35,807 --> 00:08:36,891
Remind me to tell you

147
00:08:37,100 --> 00:08:38,852
about this idea
for a television show

148
00:08:39,060 --> 00:08:40,353
my husband and I have.

149
00:08:40,562 --> 00:08:42,147
I think it's a guaranteed hit.

150
00:08:43,398 --> 00:08:45,442
So what brings you here?

151
00:08:46,526 --> 00:08:48,361
Listen, Dr. Suzuki,

152
00:08:48,570 --> 00:08:50,321
I just feel... I don't know,

153
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,782
I just feel crazy.

154
00:08:55,201 --> 00:08:57,954
I'm sorry, crazy?
Yeah, I feel crazy.

155
00:08:58,163 --> 00:08:59,330
I don't feel like myself.

156
00:08:59,539 --> 00:09:00,915
You know?
I'm tired all the time.

157
00:09:01,124 --> 00:09:02,292
I feel dizziness.

158
00:09:02,500 --> 00:09:04,169
Like there's cloudiness
in front of my eyes,

159
00:09:04,377 --> 00:09:05,837
like I'm not all the way here.

160
00:09:06,046 --> 00:09:07,756
My skin feels tight, too tight.

161
00:09:07,964 --> 00:09:09,591
And at night my arms and my back

162
00:09:09,799 --> 00:09:11,718
will burn like there's fire
on my arms and back.

163
00:09:11,926 --> 00:09:13,762
I have hot feelings in my face,

164
00:09:13,970 --> 00:09:15,013
hot hands, the hottest hands,

165
00:09:15,221 --> 00:09:16,890
and I have this rash on my back

166
00:09:17,098 --> 00:09:18,308
that just keeps getting worse,

167
00:09:18,516 --> 00:09:21,019
and, you know, it hurts
when I blink sometimes.

168
00:09:21,227 --> 00:09:23,396
I don't know.

169
00:09:23,605 --> 00:09:25,774
I know this sounds
a little extreme,

170
00:09:25,982 --> 00:09:29,235
but I just feel like I'm...
Dying.

171
00:09:34,532 --> 00:09:36,159
You mentioned you had a rash?

172
00:09:36,367 --> 00:09:38,578
Yeah, let's do the rash,
then the hot hands.

173
00:09:38,787 --> 00:09:40,622
Is this your dog?

174
00:09:40,830 --> 00:09:42,457
No, it's just, like,
a compilation

175
00:09:42,665 --> 00:09:44,375
of different cute dogs

176
00:09:44,584 --> 00:09:46,252
from all over the world.

177
00:09:46,461 --> 00:09:48,755
They're all so cute.
Yeah.

178
00:09:56,054 --> 00:09:57,597
How'd it go?

179
00:09:57,806 --> 00:09:59,641
Went fine, man. Just a routine checkup.
You know.

180
00:09:59,849 --> 00:10:01,101
Oh, okay, great.

181
00:10:01,309 --> 00:10:04,729
Thank you for your service, Sir.

182
00:10:04,938 --> 00:10:06,648
Is your neck okay?
Yeah, it's fine.

183
00:10:06,856 --> 00:10:08,399
Oh.

184
00:10:13,238 --> 00:10:15,532
Okay, I'm just gonna run in
and just lock my classroom.

185
00:10:15,740 --> 00:10:17,158
Oh, it's your cousins.

186
00:10:17,367 --> 00:10:18,993
Travis?
No, no, no. Shh, shh, shh.

187
00:10:19,202 --> 00:10:20,620
Shh. Could you, just...

188
00:10:22,914 --> 00:10:25,750
Okay, um, truth is, Jay,

189
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,920
It's... it's supposed to be
a surprise,

190
00:10:29,129 --> 00:10:30,588
me being back in town.

191
00:10:31,673 --> 00:10:33,299
A surprise?
Yeah.

192
00:10:33,508 --> 00:10:35,385
You know, you are the
only one who knows,

193
00:10:35,593 --> 00:10:37,345
so I'm going to surprise
my family later,

194
00:10:37,554 --> 00:10:39,514
so I can't really be seen
by anybody yet, you know?

195
00:10:39,722 --> 00:10:40,723
Oh, okay.

196
00:10:40,932 --> 00:10:42,559
That's fun.

197
00:10:42,767 --> 00:10:43,726
That's gonna be really fun.

198
00:10:43,935 --> 00:10:45,186
Okay, cool.
That's great.

199
00:10:45,395 --> 00:10:46,437
Uh, Spencer?
Yeah.

200
00:10:46,646 --> 00:10:48,773
Are you gonna...
Are you gonna jump out?

201
00:10:51,025 --> 00:10:52,527
I'm not sure what you...
Are you gonna, like...

202
00:10:54,529 --> 00:10:56,364
Surprise.

203
00:10:56,573 --> 00:10:58,074
Maybe. It's a good idea.

204
00:10:58,283 --> 00:10:59,659
Yeah, I might do that.
Yeah?

205
00:11:01,327 --> 00:11:03,204
Oh, man, that's gonna be
so much fun.

206
00:11:03,413 --> 00:11:04,789
Okay.

207
00:11:14,215 --> 00:11:15,466
Mr. Feldman.

208
00:11:45,288 --> 00:11:47,665
Friday's
baseball tournament winners...

209
00:11:47,874 --> 00:11:50,043
This announcement
coming from Mr. Cliff...

210
00:11:50,251 --> 00:11:52,170
Defeated Dobbs Ferry
in a close match.

211
00:11:52,378 --> 00:11:54,589
This is a great
example of figure painting

212
00:11:54,797 --> 00:11:57,800
and how it changed
during the renaissance.

213
00:11:58,009 --> 00:11:59,594
These people
aren't passive subjects.

214
00:11:59,802 --> 00:12:03,223
There's emotion.
There's intention in the eyes.

215
00:12:03,431 --> 00:12:05,183
Jay. My Mom.

216
00:12:05,391 --> 00:12:06,476
Is your Mom okay?

217
00:12:06,684 --> 00:12:07,977
Yeah, she's fine.

218
00:12:08,186 --> 00:12:09,103
It's just...

219
00:12:09,312 --> 00:12:10,104
Yeah? What?

220
00:12:10,313 --> 00:12:11,481
Can we... can we go, please?

221
00:12:11,689 --> 00:12:14,734
Yeah, sure.
Just in one second.

222
00:12:14,943 --> 00:12:16,819
What are we doing?

223
00:12:17,028 --> 00:12:18,279
Come m.

224
00:12:20,782 --> 00:12:21,991
Hi, Lisa.

225
00:12:22,200 --> 00:12:23,034
Sorry, what?

226
00:12:23,243 --> 00:12:24,911
Just... just hi.

227
00:12:25,119 --> 00:12:26,287
That's all I...
All it was.

228
00:12:26,496 --> 00:12:27,538
Oh, hi.

229
00:12:27,747 --> 00:12:29,082
Sorry, Jay, I was...

230
00:12:29,290 --> 00:12:31,125
I was at this loud band thing
last night,

231
00:12:31,334 --> 00:12:34,212
um, and I don't think my hearing
is quite back to normal.

232
00:12:35,588 --> 00:12:36,839
This is great.
It sounds great.

233
00:12:37,048 --> 00:12:39,467
It sounds like a great lineup.

234
00:12:39,676 --> 00:12:42,637
Jay and I went to school here together.
Cool.

235
00:12:42,845 --> 00:12:45,348
Yeah, Spencer and I have known
each other for a really long time.

236
00:12:45,556 --> 00:12:46,808
In seventh grade,
we hung out, like,

237
00:12:47,016 --> 00:12:47,892
every single day.

238
00:12:48,101 --> 00:12:49,352
That's so sweet.

239
00:12:49,560 --> 00:12:51,980
Um, can I actually ask
you guys a question?

240
00:12:52,188 --> 00:12:54,023
Yeah, what? Anything.

241
00:12:54,232 --> 00:12:56,234
Does my hair look weird to you?

242
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:58,486
Just because last night,
at the concert,

243
00:12:58,695 --> 00:13:01,447
somebody snapped open a stupid
glow stick right next to me,

244
00:13:01,656 --> 00:13:03,741
and I think some of it
got on my scalp.

245
00:13:03,950 --> 00:13:05,535
And I was in the shower
this morning,

246
00:13:05,743 --> 00:13:07,870
and I like...
I pulled out a clump of hair.

247
00:13:08,079 --> 00:13:10,373
So now I'm worried
that I might be balding,

248
00:13:10,581 --> 00:13:14,002
and I wondered if it looked
like I was balding to you.

249
00:13:15,712 --> 00:13:18,256
Uh... no.

250
00:13:18,464 --> 00:13:19,632
Like, not really?

251
00:13:19,841 --> 00:13:21,259
I mean, I don't think so.

252
00:13:21,467 --> 00:13:22,760
It looks like maybe
it's probably okay.

253
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:25,388
You know?
That's anxiety.

254
00:13:25,596 --> 00:13:27,557
I'm sor... what?
Yeah, that's no glow stick.

255
00:13:27,765 --> 00:13:30,101
When people are anxious, they pull out
their hair and they think they're balding.

256
00:13:30,310 --> 00:13:31,477
It's like anxiety 101.

257
00:13:31,686 --> 00:13:33,479
I don't...
I don't think I'm that anxious.

258
00:13:33,688 --> 00:13:36,107
You want an Ativan? I think I have
one loose in my pocket somewhere,

259
00:13:36,316 --> 00:13:38,568
or maybe a Xanax.
I can give you one of each.

260
00:13:38,776 --> 00:13:40,153
I don't think...
I agree, though that...

261
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:41,696
I'm sure you're not balding.

262
00:13:41,904 --> 00:13:43,614
I really hope not.
That would be so terrible.

263
00:13:43,823 --> 00:13:45,491
I'd have to...
I'd have to buy a toupee.

264
00:13:45,700 --> 00:13:46,492
Yeah.

265
00:13:46,701 --> 00:13:47,493
Hello.
Hello.

266
00:13:47,702 --> 00:13:48,786
I guess it sticks.

267
00:13:48,995 --> 00:13:50,580
This is funny
but we gotta go, really.

268
00:13:50,788 --> 00:13:51,831
Okay, we have to go,

269
00:13:52,040 --> 00:13:53,916
but I'm just gonna lock
my class,

270
00:13:54,125 --> 00:13:56,627
and if anyone needs anything, like,
to borrow a camera or something,

271
00:13:56,836 --> 00:13:58,004
you can just let them in.

272
00:13:58,212 --> 00:13:59,255
Okay.
Great.

273
00:13:59,464 --> 00:14:01,007
All right,
I'll be back at 2:00.

274
00:14:01,215 --> 00:14:03,009
O0.
Wait, what? What are you talking about?

275
00:14:03,217 --> 00:14:04,344
I've a meeting...
Didn't I tell you?

276
00:14:04,552 --> 00:14:05,678
I have a meeting
with a student at 2:00.

277
00:14:05,887 --> 00:14:07,013
That's, like, my only thing.

278
00:14:07,221 --> 00:14:08,556
Like...
2:00, you said?

279
00:14:08,765 --> 00:14:10,516
Yeah, I guess I just forgot.

280
00:14:10,725 --> 00:14:12,101
Could you move it to 5:45?

281
00:14:12,310 --> 00:14:14,145
Um, I really shouldn't

282
00:14:14,354 --> 00:14:16,272
'cause that's after school hours...
You know what? It's okay.

283
00:14:16,481 --> 00:14:18,608
But you're just gonna have to keep
it kind of brief, okay? Okay.

284
00:14:18,816 --> 00:14:20,610
Nice to meet you, Lisa.
Yeah, you too, you too.

285
00:14:20,818 --> 00:14:21,778
See you later.

286
00:14:21,986 --> 00:14:23,363
Hey, Jay.

287
00:14:23,571 --> 00:14:25,907
I can't wait to see
your stuff up on the walls.

288
00:14:26,115 --> 00:14:28,368
Okay, can't wait to see you
out in the halls.

289
00:14:28,576 --> 00:14:29,911
Oh.
What?

290
00:14:30,119 --> 00:14:31,621
'Kay, bye.
Bye.

291
00:14:34,290 --> 00:14:35,708
Mr. Feldman,
I have a question about nails.

292
00:14:35,958 --> 00:14:37,085
Yeah... no, don't...

293
00:14:37,293 --> 00:14:38,795
I'm gonna be in the car.
Okay, yeah.

294
00:14:39,003 --> 00:14:40,963
What are you nailing, Phil?
Don't nail.

295
00:14:41,172 --> 00:14:43,716
No, I said you're gonna use... you
see how these are all pushpins?

296
00:14:43,925 --> 00:14:45,468
You just gotta use...
Put this back, please.

297
00:14:51,099 --> 00:14:53,976
Uh, Mr. Sulanaro.

298
00:14:54,185 --> 00:14:55,353
Spencer kaminski.
Do you remember me?

299
00:14:55,561 --> 00:14:57,522
Holy shit. Spencer.
Of course, buddy.

300
00:14:57,730 --> 00:14:59,023
Good to see you, man.

301
00:14:59,232 --> 00:15:01,192
How's everything going?
It's good, man.

302
00:15:01,401 --> 00:15:03,069
Not much has changed.
Still fighting the good fight.

303
00:15:03,277 --> 00:15:04,404
Administration's always
trying to stifle

304
00:15:04,612 --> 00:15:06,322
my right to teach as I see fit.

305
00:15:06,531 --> 00:15:08,282
You know, I say, "poison,
this isn't social studies.

306
00:15:08,491 --> 00:15:09,992
I can't teach
a fucking rubric. This is art."

307
00:15:10,201 --> 00:15:11,702
Yeah, yeah. Well, you know,

308
00:15:11,911 --> 00:15:13,996
I still think about
your class all the time.

309
00:15:14,205 --> 00:15:15,331
That's good to hear, man.

310
00:15:15,540 --> 00:15:17,166
So you're out
on the left coast, yeah?

311
00:15:17,375 --> 00:15:19,335
Yeah, yeah, It's...
You know, it's going well.

312
00:15:19,544 --> 00:15:21,379
Well, listen.
I got a meeting.

313
00:15:21,587 --> 00:15:22,964
But you should totally pop by
my class later.

314
00:15:23,172 --> 00:15:24,340
I'll introduce you.
You can...

315
00:15:24,549 --> 00:15:25,758
You can say a few things,
you know...

316
00:15:25,967 --> 00:15:27,135
Sounds good.
I'd be honored. Yeah.

317
00:15:27,343 --> 00:15:30,596
Hey, keep 'em honest out there.

318
00:15:57,665 --> 00:15:59,876
I don't get
how this relates to teeth.

319
00:16:02,795 --> 00:16:04,797
I think it's just
supposed to be soothing,

320
00:16:05,006 --> 00:16:07,300
like to make your relax, but...

321
00:16:07,508 --> 00:16:08,384
Spencer?

322
00:16:08,593 --> 00:16:10,261
Spencer kaminski?

323
00:16:10,470 --> 00:16:12,221
Oh, my goodness!

324
00:16:12,430 --> 00:16:15,933
Your mother and I, we were just
talking about you yesterday.

325
00:16:16,142 --> 00:16:18,311
She didn't mention
you were coming home.

326
00:16:18,519 --> 00:16:19,520
How are you?

327
00:16:19,729 --> 00:16:20,938
It's so good to see you.

328
00:16:21,147 --> 00:16:23,941
Yeah, I'm... you know,

329
00:16:24,150 --> 00:16:25,485
I'm doing okay.

330
00:16:25,693 --> 00:16:26,694
How are you doing, Laurie?

331
00:16:26,903 --> 00:16:28,946
I'm pretty well.
Did you hear?

332
00:16:29,155 --> 00:16:31,282
Loretta's son Tyler...
He got hammertoe surgery.

333
00:16:31,491 --> 00:16:32,867
Wow.

334
00:16:33,075 --> 00:16:34,744
Yeah, he had a serious case
of hammertoe.

335
00:16:34,952 --> 00:16:36,204
Dr. Perry said

336
00:16:36,412 --> 00:16:38,122
it was the worst case
of hammertoe

337
00:16:38,331 --> 00:16:40,750
in Hastings history, Tyler had.

338
00:16:41,000 --> 00:16:44,629
Spencer, Dr.
Goldsmith is ready for you.

339
00:16:44,837 --> 00:16:47,507
So... how long are you
in town for, Spencer?

340
00:16:47,715 --> 00:16:48,966
Yeah, um...

341
00:16:49,175 --> 00:16:51,344
Laurie, my Mom doesn't know
I'm in town yet.

342
00:16:51,552 --> 00:16:54,347
It's a surprise. I'm going
to surprise her later,

343
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:56,933
so if you could refrain from
telling her that you saw me,

344
00:16:57,141 --> 00:16:58,768
that would be great.

345
00:16:58,976 --> 00:17:01,479
I'm gonna... jump out.

346
00:17:01,687 --> 00:17:04,023
Sure, Spencer.

347
00:17:04,232 --> 00:17:06,859
I... won't mention it to her.

348
00:17:07,068 --> 00:17:08,569
Okay, great.

349
00:17:24,710 --> 00:17:25,753
Is that Spencer?

350
00:17:30,508 --> 00:17:31,717
Look at you, man.

351
00:17:31,926 --> 00:17:33,261
Hey, how long has it been?

352
00:17:33,469 --> 00:17:35,304
It's your first time
in the new office. Huh?

353
00:17:35,513 --> 00:17:36,556
What do you think?

354
00:17:36,764 --> 00:17:38,641
Lots of colors.
Yep.

355
00:17:38,849 --> 00:17:41,143
You know, I was just talking
with your uncle about this.

356
00:17:41,352 --> 00:17:43,104
I remember a little boy

357
00:17:43,312 --> 00:17:46,315
who could not wait to get
his teeth cleaned.

358
00:17:46,524 --> 00:17:48,317
Your sister would come in here

359
00:17:48,526 --> 00:17:50,111
and just cry and cry,

360
00:17:50,319 --> 00:17:51,988
but you always loved it.

361
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:53,990
You were always so giggly.

362
00:17:54,198 --> 00:17:56,492
What were you so giggly about?

363
00:17:56,701 --> 00:17:59,745
Honestly, man, I'm pretty
worried about my mouth.

364
00:18:00,913 --> 00:18:02,123
Okay.

365
00:18:02,331 --> 00:18:04,250
Uh, have you been flossing?

366
00:18:04,458 --> 00:18:05,501
Okay, so...

367
00:18:06,794 --> 00:18:08,504
So I've been reading,

368
00:18:08,713 --> 00:18:10,715
you know,
a lot about mouth cancer,

369
00:18:10,923 --> 00:18:11,716
about oral cancer,

370
00:18:11,924 --> 00:18:13,509
and apparently if you have lumps

371
00:18:13,718 --> 00:18:14,719
or sores in your mouth,

372
00:18:14,927 --> 00:18:16,137
that's a pretty telltale sign,

373
00:18:16,345 --> 00:18:17,972
and I'm pretty sure
that I have those.

374
00:18:18,180 --> 00:18:19,473
Uh-huh.
So and also

375
00:18:19,682 --> 00:18:21,601
I think there's
a deep, hard edged crack

376
00:18:21,809 --> 00:18:23,060
in the tissue of my mouth.

377
00:18:23,269 --> 00:18:25,688
A deep, hard-edged crack.

378
00:18:25,896 --> 00:18:27,273
Mm.
Is this stuff you're reading about...

379
00:18:27,481 --> 00:18:28,399
About on the Internet?

380
00:18:28,608 --> 00:18:30,026
Well, it's all new.

381
00:18:32,903 --> 00:18:35,823
Well, this is, uh...

382
00:18:36,032 --> 00:18:37,533
It's hardly new.

383
00:18:37,742 --> 00:18:41,329
New to someone
who's not a dentist maybe.

384
00:18:54,842 --> 00:18:59,972
The good news is,
that hard-edged crack

385
00:19:00,181 --> 00:19:02,266
is absolutely nothing
to worry about.

386
00:19:02,475 --> 00:19:04,143
Phew, right?

387
00:19:04,352 --> 00:19:06,103
Now, the bad news is

388
00:19:06,312 --> 00:19:08,981
you have three little,
Itty-bitty cavities

389
00:19:09,190 --> 00:19:10,399
that we're gonna need to fill...

390
00:19:10,608 --> 00:19:11,942
One here, one here, and one...

391
00:19:13,486 --> 00:19:15,655
Way over here.
Huh? Molar 17.

392
00:19:15,863 --> 00:19:17,948
Well, Dad, if
you'd just call the steakhouse

393
00:19:18,157 --> 00:19:19,325
and you could just...

394
00:19:19,533 --> 00:19:21,661
Well, don't... I've had
issues with attachments,

395
00:19:21,869 --> 00:19:24,038
so just...
No, don't...

396
00:19:24,246 --> 00:19:26,874
I... nobody...
I don't have a faxing ability.

397
00:19:27,083 --> 00:19:28,000
I don't at the...

398
00:19:28,209 --> 00:19:29,960
Okay, yeah.

399
00:19:30,169 --> 00:19:32,880
You know, when our friend
Spencer here was a little boy,

400
00:19:33,089 --> 00:19:36,217
he used to do these little
comedy magic sketches

401
00:19:36,425 --> 00:19:39,387
with his sister Jo
at the PTA every year.

402
00:19:39,595 --> 00:19:42,181
They had marionettes.
They did voices.

403
00:19:42,390 --> 00:19:44,767
One year they sawed
the superintendent in half.

404
00:19:46,852 --> 00:19:48,604
Oh, wonderfully elaborate stuff.

405
00:19:48,813 --> 00:19:50,272
Always done with safety.
Right, Spencer?

406
00:19:50,481 --> 00:19:52,441
All right, open wide now.

407
00:19:52,650 --> 00:19:54,068
Open, Spencer.

408
00:19:54,276 --> 00:19:55,361
That's my boy.

409
00:19:55,569 --> 00:19:57,530
Okay, Karen, bring it in.

410
00:20:00,324 --> 00:20:03,369
Uh, yes, okay, that works.

411
00:20:03,577 --> 00:20:06,330
Thank you for understanding.
I'll see you then. Bye.

412
00:20:06,539 --> 00:20:08,374
Dr. Kaplan's gonna fit me in
at 3:00.

413
00:20:08,582 --> 00:20:10,668
It's fine. Now we've got
time to eat, so that's great.

414
00:20:18,217 --> 00:20:19,677
Thank you.

415
00:20:19,885 --> 00:20:21,345
Thanks.
Enjoy, guys.

416
00:20:27,601 --> 00:20:30,771
So how's your sister doing?

417
00:20:30,980 --> 00:20:32,398
She seems to be doing
really great.

418
00:20:32,606 --> 00:20:33,816
I've seen her around a lot.

419
00:20:34,024 --> 00:20:35,985
She seems like, really,
like happy and healthy.

420
00:20:36,193 --> 00:20:38,696
Yeah, yeah, she's doing good.
It's a process.

421
00:20:38,904 --> 00:20:40,531
She was telling me about
that treatment place,

422
00:20:40,740 --> 00:20:42,366
and it just sounds,
like, really great fit...

423
00:20:42,575 --> 00:20:44,285
I gotta...
I gotta write more standup.

424
00:20:44,493 --> 00:20:46,704
That's my problem.
These viral guys...

425
00:20:46,912 --> 00:20:48,789
They have the opportunity
to open for big acts,

426
00:20:48,998 --> 00:20:50,624
but they go up there
and they bomb

427
00:20:50,833 --> 00:20:52,877
'cause they've got no material,
like they're out of ideas.

428
00:20:53,085 --> 00:20:55,337
I've got plenty of ideas,
but, you know, I gotta...

429
00:20:55,546 --> 00:20:58,090
I gotta write more standup.
I gotta focus.

430
00:20:58,299 --> 00:21:02,303
What's funny in here?
Waitresses, their outfits,

431
00:21:02,511 --> 00:21:03,554
soda...

432
00:21:03,763 --> 00:21:04,597
French fries?

433
00:21:04,805 --> 00:21:07,725
Soup. Soup is funny.

434
00:21:07,933 --> 00:21:09,351
Cream of broccoli soup.

435
00:21:12,271 --> 00:21:14,857
Why do we still call it
cream of broccoli?

436
00:21:15,065 --> 00:21:17,401
Isn't that kind of disgusting?

437
00:21:17,610 --> 00:21:19,195
Doesn't that conjure up an image

438
00:21:19,403 --> 00:21:20,696
of a piece of broccoli

439
00:21:20,905 --> 00:21:21,864
ejaculating?

440
00:21:22,072 --> 00:21:23,574
Isn't it about time

441
00:21:23,783 --> 00:21:25,326
that we had
a diner summit meeting

442
00:21:25,534 --> 00:21:27,036
and officially changed
that name?

443
00:21:27,244 --> 00:21:28,370
You think that's funny?

444
00:21:28,579 --> 00:21:30,206
I feel like that
could be funny, right?

445
00:21:30,414 --> 00:21:31,540
Seem funny to you?

446
00:21:31,749 --> 00:21:35,211
Yeah. Yeah, it's really funny.

447
00:21:35,419 --> 00:21:36,754
How do you spell broccoli?

448
00:21:40,174 --> 00:21:41,592
I remember you in high school,

449
00:21:41,801 --> 00:21:43,928
in that Roman musical.

450
00:21:44,136 --> 00:21:46,138
You remember that?
That was really funny.

451
00:21:48,766 --> 00:21:49,809
That was your song.
Remember?

452
00:21:50,017 --> 00:21:51,310
Please stop singing.

453
00:21:51,519 --> 00:21:53,020
You remember this?

454
00:21:53,229 --> 00:21:55,189
I remember... I do remember
this song, but shh, shh.

455
00:21:55,397 --> 00:21:56,565
You should do musicals.

456
00:21:56,774 --> 00:21:58,150
You ever talk to Betsy
about, like...

457
00:21:58,359 --> 00:21:59,860
You can't just do musicals.

458
00:22:00,069 --> 00:22:01,237
It's a whole other industry.

459
00:22:01,445 --> 00:22:03,072
You remember like this?

460
00:22:03,280 --> 00:22:04,907
You always did that,
with the wink and the salute

461
00:22:05,115 --> 00:22:06,325
in all the photos.
Why did you do that?

462
00:22:06,534 --> 00:22:07,701
It was my thing.

463
00:22:07,910 --> 00:22:09,370
So funny, those pictures.

464
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:11,497
Oh, god.

465
00:22:14,166 --> 00:22:17,545
S-Spencer kaminski,
is that you?

466
00:22:17,753 --> 00:22:19,922
Davis, what's going on, man?

467
00:22:20,130 --> 00:22:21,090
It's been a while, huh?

468
00:22:21,298 --> 00:22:23,217
Yeah.

469
00:22:23,425 --> 00:22:25,511
So nice to see you.

470
00:22:25,719 --> 00:22:28,097
How you doing, Jay?
Good. How you doing?

471
00:22:28,305 --> 00:22:30,266
Pretty good. Just getting
over some indigestion.

472
00:22:30,474 --> 00:22:32,935
Oh, yeah?
Than ks, Diane.

473
00:22:33,143 --> 00:22:35,020
What are you up to
nowadays, Davis?

474
00:22:35,229 --> 00:22:37,189
Davis works at Antoinette's.

475
00:22:37,398 --> 00:22:39,191
It's been really good for me.

476
00:22:39,400 --> 00:22:40,985
I had a hard time finding a job

477
00:22:41,193 --> 00:22:42,987
after the whole
muscle relaxers' incident.

478
00:22:43,195 --> 00:22:44,989
Mo you hear about that?

479
00:22:45,197 --> 00:22:46,323
Muscle relaxers?

480
00:22:46,532 --> 00:22:48,409
I had no idea
how much I would learn

481
00:22:48,617 --> 00:22:51,203
from getting arrested
for illegal muscle relaxers,

482
00:22:51,412 --> 00:22:53,289
but I'm doing better now,

483
00:22:53,497 --> 00:22:55,124
and things are good.

484
00:22:55,332 --> 00:22:58,502
Last summer I was ordained
as a minister,

485
00:22:58,711 --> 00:23:01,338
kind of like a goof
for John's wedding,

486
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:03,173
but I've really grown
into the role,

487
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:07,428
and I baptized a baby
a few weeks ago.

488
00:23:07,636 --> 00:23:08,554
It was amazing.

489
00:23:08,762 --> 00:23:09,805
Wow.

490
00:23:10,014 --> 00:23:12,182
And I just like working
at Antoinette's.

491
00:23:12,391 --> 00:23:14,018
I get all the free food I want,

492
00:23:14,226 --> 00:23:15,144
free paninis,

493
00:23:15,352 --> 00:23:16,729
and it's a safe space for me.

494
00:23:16,937 --> 00:23:18,564
I don't think
I'm going to slide back

495
00:23:18,772 --> 00:23:21,191
into the whole
muscle relaxer thing.

496
00:23:21,400 --> 00:23:22,985
Enough about me.
How about you?

497
00:23:23,193 --> 00:23:24,361
What have you been up to?

498
00:23:24,570 --> 00:23:25,863
I'm good.
I'm doing good.

499
00:23:26,071 --> 00:23:27,615
I, uh, living out in L.A.

500
00:23:27,823 --> 00:23:29,450
L.A.

501
00:23:29,658 --> 00:23:32,286
I'll tell you, it's crazy
to be back in this diner.

502
00:23:32,494 --> 00:23:36,290
Uh, I was actually
looking at the menu,

503
00:23:36,498 --> 00:23:39,627
and I noticed that
they still call it cream...

504
00:23:40,920 --> 00:23:42,630
Of broccoli soup.

505
00:23:42,838 --> 00:23:45,466
Sounds a little disgusting,
isn't it?

506
00:23:45,674 --> 00:23:47,259
Can we officially have
a diner summit meeting

507
00:23:47,468 --> 00:23:49,511
where we...
Where we just change that up?

508
00:23:49,720 --> 00:23:50,846
Right?

509
00:23:52,932 --> 00:23:56,018
What's a diner summit meeting?

510
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:59,813
Yeah, it's like a theoretical
meeting of the diners.

511
00:24:00,022 --> 00:24:02,024
Oh.

512
00:24:02,232 --> 00:24:03,734
It's not real.

513
00:24:03,943 --> 00:24:06,695
Yeah, it's like a joke
that Spencer's working on.

514
00:24:06,904 --> 00:24:08,781
It's very funny.

515
00:24:08,989 --> 00:24:10,532
Uh-oh, shit.

516
00:24:11,700 --> 00:24:13,160
Oh, it's your cousins.

517
00:24:18,707 --> 00:24:20,376
Where is he going?

518
00:24:27,967 --> 00:24:30,678
He's gonna surprise
everybody later,

519
00:24:30,886 --> 00:24:32,262
so he's just, like...
He's just hiding

520
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:33,347
he's gonna...

521
00:24:33,555 --> 00:24:35,224
Oh, okay, like a joke.

522
00:24:35,432 --> 00:24:36,642
Yeah, he was gonna jump out.

523
00:24:36,850 --> 00:24:38,435
That's very funny.

524
00:24:38,644 --> 00:24:40,145
Yeah.

525
00:24:40,354 --> 00:24:41,563
Gonna be fun.
Yeah.

526
00:25:02,209 --> 00:25:04,420
Yeah, my patient file should...

527
00:25:04,628 --> 00:25:06,296
My patient file should be there.

528
00:25:06,505 --> 00:25:09,008
Yeah, because I've been coming
to your office since I was nine,

529
00:25:09,216 --> 00:25:11,093
so I don't...

530
00:25:11,301 --> 00:25:12,761
Well...

531
00:25:12,970 --> 00:25:14,638
Well, look under spencie maybe.

532
00:25:14,847 --> 00:25:17,099
Spencie. Yeah.

533
00:25:17,307 --> 00:25:19,643
Wha... my middle name?

534
00:25:19,852 --> 00:25:21,270
My middle name is David,

535
00:25:21,478 --> 00:25:23,230
but no one's...

536
00:25:23,439 --> 00:25:24,940
Okay, well, it's David. Yeah.

537
00:25:25,149 --> 00:25:27,026
D-a-v-i-d, but literally

538
00:25:27,234 --> 00:25:28,569
no one calls me that.

539
00:25:28,777 --> 00:25:30,612
I barely do that.

540
00:25:30,821 --> 00:25:34,491
Uh, Spencer David kaminski, yes.

541
00:25:34,700 --> 00:25:36,785
That's great.
I'll see you in 46 minutes.

542
00:25:36,994 --> 00:25:38,370
Bye.

543
00:25:47,796 --> 00:25:49,465
Got it.

544
00:25:57,848 --> 00:26:00,142
I'm just trying to change
the background on my computer.

545
00:26:00,350 --> 00:26:02,686
One of my students
keeps changing it.

546
00:26:02,895 --> 00:26:06,940
Wow, man, look at you. You
were so young and full of...

547
00:26:07,149 --> 00:26:09,359
I don't know, no beard.

548
00:26:09,568 --> 00:26:11,195
I just... it was rocks before,

549
00:26:11,403 --> 00:26:13,072
it was like a picture of rocks,

550
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:15,824
and I liked it there that way.
I liked looking at the...

551
00:26:16,909 --> 00:26:18,243
The rocks.

552
00:26:19,578 --> 00:26:20,829
Okay.

553
00:26:23,582 --> 00:26:28,087
It's a really nice setup
you got here, man.

554
00:26:28,295 --> 00:26:29,129
You make this thing?

555
00:26:29,338 --> 00:26:30,506
Uh, s-Spencer,

556
00:26:30,714 --> 00:26:31,924
can you actually...
What's it do?

557
00:26:32,132 --> 00:26:35,761
Please, just-g
can you just put It...

558
00:26:35,969 --> 00:26:37,346
Put it down?

559
00:26:42,226 --> 00:26:43,310
Jay?

560
00:26:44,895 --> 00:26:48,190
It's for chili.

561
00:26:48,398 --> 00:26:53,028
Jay, are you having feelings
about this pot?

562
00:26:53,237 --> 00:26:55,405
Okay, do you promise you're
not gonna tell anybody

563
00:26:57,491 --> 00:27:00,327
so we... uh, Lisa and I...

564
00:27:00,536 --> 00:27:01,662
I don't remember who started it.

565
00:27:01,870 --> 00:27:03,413
Maybe it was her.
Maybe it was me.

566
00:27:03,622 --> 00:27:05,415
But we were like,
"let's get dinner sometime."

567
00:27:05,624 --> 00:27:08,127
And so then we did, I don't know
if it was, like, a date thing,

568
00:27:08,335 --> 00:27:09,378
or, like,
a friend thing, or what.

569
00:27:09,586 --> 00:27:11,630
But we had
this really nice dinner.

570
00:27:11,839 --> 00:27:13,882
We went to that steakhouse that I
was telling you about, that new one.

571
00:27:14,091 --> 00:27:15,092
Right, enough
about the steakhouse.

572
00:27:15,300 --> 00:27:16,218
It's in the story.

573
00:27:16,426 --> 00:27:17,803
Still.
Okay.

574
00:27:18,011 --> 00:27:19,888
So we're at dinner,
having a really nice time.

575
00:27:20,097 --> 00:27:22,099
We were, like,
talking and laughing,

576
00:27:22,307 --> 00:27:24,476
and, like, talking
about inside jokes,

577
00:27:24,685 --> 00:27:26,770
like teacher inside jokes,
like you wouldn't get

578
00:27:26,979 --> 00:27:28,939
but, like, stuff from
teaching here and stuff.

579
00:27:29,148 --> 00:27:31,108
And it's just real easy
to talk to her.

580
00:27:31,316 --> 00:27:33,110
That's good.
That's a good thing.

581
00:27:33,318 --> 00:27:35,362
And then I went back
to her place.

582
00:27:35,571 --> 00:27:37,406
She lives, like, in town,

583
00:27:37,614 --> 00:27:39,074
like above the bookstore.

584
00:27:39,283 --> 00:27:41,285
And so then we had...
She had, like, wine,

585
00:27:41,493 --> 00:27:42,995
like it was really red.

586
00:27:43,203 --> 00:27:45,706
And we were sitting
on the couch,

587
00:27:45,914 --> 00:27:47,416
and I leaned over,

588
00:27:47,624 --> 00:27:48,834
and I kissed her.

589
00:27:49,042 --> 00:27:53,046
And then, uh, we, uh...

590
00:27:53,255 --> 00:27:55,549
Had... sex.

591
00:27:55,757 --> 00:27:57,009
Fucking great.

592
00:27:58,385 --> 00:27:59,595
Was it your first time?

593
00:27:59,803 --> 00:28:01,847
Come on, no.
I'm sorry.

594
00:28:02,055 --> 00:28:04,766
No, it's like...
I'm, like, in my late 20s.

595
00:28:04,975 --> 00:28:06,435
I know. You are and I'm sorry.

596
00:28:06,643 --> 00:28:08,520
It's okay.
But it was special, right?

597
00:28:08,729 --> 00:28:09,563
Yes.

598
00:28:09,771 --> 00:28:11,148
Definitely really special.

599
00:28:11,356 --> 00:28:13,817
And then afterward
we just started talking,

600
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:15,777
like really talking,

601
00:28:15,986 --> 00:28:17,821
like I told her all this stuff,

602
00:28:18,030 --> 00:28:19,865
like about my Dad
and about my life,

603
00:28:20,073 --> 00:28:22,659
like sometimes I didn't even know
what was coming out of my mouth,

604
00:28:22,868 --> 00:28:24,995
like it was just straight
from my heart to my mouth,

605
00:28:25,204 --> 00:28:26,455
like my heart was talking,

606
00:28:26,663 --> 00:28:28,081
not my mouth.

607
00:28:28,290 --> 00:28:29,666
And she told me all this stuff,

608
00:28:29,875 --> 00:28:31,460
like about her parents
and about her brother

609
00:28:31,668 --> 00:28:33,629
and, like, we want
a lot of the same things,

610
00:28:33,837 --> 00:28:37,424
like I think we think
a lot of the same things.

611
00:28:37,633 --> 00:28:40,594
This is the most amazing thing
ever, man.

612
00:28:40,802 --> 00:28:45,224
But then afterwards
she got really quiet...

613
00:28:46,391 --> 00:28:48,101
And, w-w-we agreed

614
00:28:48,310 --> 00:28:49,728
that it would be best

615
00:28:49,937 --> 00:28:51,730
if I actually didn't sleep over,

616
00:28:51,939 --> 00:28:54,775
which I'm still
kind of confused about

617
00:28:54,983 --> 00:28:57,277
because it was like I was
already lying down,

618
00:28:57,486 --> 00:28:59,488
and I was tired.

619
00:28:59,696 --> 00:29:00,614
We were both tired.

620
00:29:00,822 --> 00:29:02,324
And the next day at school

621
00:29:02,532 --> 00:29:04,618
she, like, pulled me aside.
It was during an assembly,

622
00:29:04,826 --> 00:29:06,912
so the hallways
were pretty much empty,

623
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:08,372
and she was just like...

624
00:29:10,123 --> 00:29:11,625
"I feel like this was a mistake.

625
00:29:11,833 --> 00:29:13,293
I think we
should just be friends."

626
00:29:13,502 --> 00:29:14,962
Mm-hmm.

627
00:29:15,170 --> 00:29:17,089
And what did you say?

628
00:29:17,297 --> 00:29:19,800
Um, I think I nodded
a few times.

629
00:29:20,008 --> 00:29:21,843
I don't know.
I didn't want to be loud

630
00:29:22,052 --> 00:29:23,011
because of the assembly.

631
00:29:23,220 --> 00:29:24,304
Listen, Jay.

632
00:29:24,513 --> 00:29:26,348
You gotta talk to her
about this.

633
00:29:26,556 --> 00:29:28,517
You gotta, you know, tell her
this was a big deal to you, man.

634
00:29:28,725 --> 00:29:31,061
Sometimes you gotta be loud,
Jay,

635
00:29:31,270 --> 00:29:32,938
like loud emotionally,

636
00:29:33,146 --> 00:29:35,274
even if during an assembly.

637
00:29:35,482 --> 00:29:37,067
I just-.

638
00:29:37,276 --> 00:29:38,485
I feel like she thinks...

639
00:29:38,694 --> 00:29:40,070
Who care what she thinks, man?

640
00:29:40,279 --> 00:29:41,446
This shit isn't about her.

641
00:29:41,655 --> 00:29:42,948
This was your first time, Jay.

642
00:29:43,156 --> 00:29:44,324
Spencer“ I'm so sorry.

643
00:29:44,533 --> 00:29:46,159
Why don't...
I told you that it's not.

644
00:29:46,368 --> 00:29:47,995
I don't know
why I said it again.

645
00:29:48,203 --> 00:29:49,329
It's okay.
I'm really so sorry.

646
00:29:49,538 --> 00:29:50,497
It's okay.

647
00:29:50,706 --> 00:29:51,790
One minute.

648
00:29:54,042 --> 00:29:55,252
Just be normal.
Yeah.

649
00:30:01,466 --> 00:30:02,759
What's up, Jay?

650
00:30:02,968 --> 00:30:04,469
Mr. Feldman, please, Amber.

651
00:30:04,678 --> 00:30:06,305
Could you actually just...

652
00:30:06,513 --> 00:30:08,473
Amber, um...

653
00:30:09,975 --> 00:30:11,727
Okay, I'm gonna go, man.

654
00:30:11,935 --> 00:30:13,562
Okay.

655
00:30:13,770 --> 00:30:16,023
Put that pot down.
It's for chili.

656
00:30:16,231 --> 00:30:17,399
Okay, bro.

657
00:31:07,407 --> 00:31:08,784
You don't understand,
Mr. Feldman.

658
00:31:08,992 --> 00:31:10,118
This is bigger than you.

659
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:11,661
If I fail this class,

660
00:31:11,870 --> 00:31:13,997
it's going to stay with me
for the rest of my life.

661
00:31:14,206 --> 00:31:15,832
Not you. Me.

662
00:31:16,041 --> 00:31:18,126
Okay, Amber, well, you haven't
done any of the assignments.

663
00:31:18,335 --> 00:31:20,545
It's easy, Mr. Feldman.
Just don't fail me.

664
00:31:20,754 --> 00:31:21,922
What a simple idea.

665
00:31:22,130 --> 00:31:24,174
Instead of failing me,
just don't.

666
00:31:25,759 --> 00:31:27,844
Well... okay, well,
how about this?

667
00:31:28,053 --> 00:31:30,347
What if... what if we did, like,
a fun extra-credit assignment...

668
00:31:30,555 --> 00:31:31,973
Just don't fail me. Okay?

669
00:31:32,182 --> 00:31:34,476
I'm way to busy to start doing
work for this class.

670
00:31:34,684 --> 00:31:36,395
I have field hockey practice
literally every day

671
00:31:36,603 --> 00:31:38,480
so when you go to give me
a grade

672
00:31:38,688 --> 00:31:42,025
with your little pen, just
write any grade other than an F.

673
00:31:42,234 --> 00:31:44,611
B? Fine.

674
00:31:46,738 --> 00:31:47,906
I mean, I guess...

675
00:31:48,115 --> 00:31:49,366
I gotta go to practice.

676
00:31:53,453 --> 00:31:54,996
Listen, Mr. Feldman.

677
00:31:55,205 --> 00:31:56,998
I'd really appreciate this.

678
00:31:57,207 --> 00:31:58,959
You're a great
photography teacher.

679
00:31:59,167 --> 00:32:03,380
You've taught me so much about
photos and photo paper and stuff.

680
00:32:03,588 --> 00:32:05,757
I feel like we really get
each other. You know?

681
00:32:05,966 --> 00:32:08,051
So just please

682
00:32:08,260 --> 00:32:10,846
don't fail me.

683
00:32:14,516 --> 00:32:18,437
Okay, Amber,
I'll see what I can do.

684
00:32:18,645 --> 00:32:20,147
Word.

685
00:32:31,450 --> 00:32:33,034
"Lord, how angry I am.

686
00:32:33,243 --> 00:32:35,412
Angry enough to throw mud
at the whole world.

687
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:39,040
I even felt ill. Servant!"

688
00:32:39,249 --> 00:32:42,878
"Sir, in my solitude I have
become unaccustomed to the human voice,

689
00:32:43,086 --> 00:32:45,380
and I cannot stand the sound
of loud talking.

690
00:32:45,589 --> 00:32:47,132
I beg you, please, to cease"...

691
00:32:47,340 --> 00:32:48,800
Mark, Gary, pause for a second.

692
00:32:49,009 --> 00:32:52,679
Look at me.
Tell me the truth.

693
00:32:52,888 --> 00:32:55,390
Did you guys prepare that scene
at all prior to this class?

694
00:32:55,599 --> 00:32:57,017
'Cause I have a hunch

695
00:32:57,225 --> 00:33:01,438
that we just watched you
read it for the first time.

696
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,398
All right.

697
00:33:03,607 --> 00:33:05,484
Well,
you guys just wasted our time.

698
00:33:07,861 --> 00:33:09,112
Sit down.

699
00:33:10,906 --> 00:33:13,658
Okay, acting's not reading.

700
00:33:13,867 --> 00:33:15,702
Okay?

701
00:33:15,911 --> 00:33:19,247
Acting is not recreating something
you saw on TV one time.

702
00:33:19,456 --> 00:33:21,917
Acting is embodying a character.

703
00:33:22,125 --> 00:33:24,044
It's living
in that character's skin

704
00:33:24,252 --> 00:33:25,754
and bones, flesh and guts.

705
00:33:25,962 --> 00:33:28,840
What you two just did,
if I may say, was bullshit.

706
00:33:31,510 --> 00:33:32,636
Who wants to go next?

707
00:33:33,803 --> 00:33:36,014
Hey, everyone, this is Spencer,

708
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:38,391
one of the best students
I ever had.

709
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,895
He's an example of someone who understands
the raw power of a true performance.

710
00:33:42,103 --> 00:33:44,731
You wanna come up here and say something,
Spence? Sure, okay, Ned, thanks.

711
00:33:44,940 --> 00:33:48,151
Come on up.
Sure, thank you. Really quick.

712
00:33:48,360 --> 00:33:50,612
Spencer.
Good to see you.

713
00:33:50,820 --> 00:33:52,239
Thank you, everybody.

714
00:33:52,447 --> 00:33:54,199
Uh, I am Spencer kaminski.

715
00:33:54,407 --> 00:33:55,951
I'm an actor/comedian

716
00:33:56,159 --> 00:33:59,704
with an emphasis on standup and
web sketch work at the moment.

717
00:33:59,913 --> 00:34:01,373
And last Thanksgiving
I made a thing called

718
00:34:01,581 --> 00:34:03,041
"the fucked up
brother-in-law."

719
00:34:03,250 --> 00:34:04,209
Oh, thank you very much.

720
00:34:04,417 --> 00:34:06,002
That's great.

721
00:34:06,211 --> 00:34:08,380
Well, yeah, it got a lot
of likes and subscribers,

722
00:34:08,588 --> 00:34:09,798
which is fantastic.

723
00:34:10,006 --> 00:34:11,716
And it actually got
me my agent Betsy,

724
00:34:11,925 --> 00:34:13,802
and agents are very important

725
00:34:14,010 --> 00:34:16,513
if you wanna get seen during pilot
season or get commercial work,

726
00:34:16,721 --> 00:34:19,140
but you have to remember
that agents can't create heat

727
00:34:19,349 --> 00:34:21,184
where there isn't already
some kind of spark.

728
00:34:28,149 --> 00:34:30,235
What grade is this, tenth grade?

729
00:34:30,443 --> 00:34:32,988
Ninth grade? Tenth grade?

730
00:34:33,196 --> 00:34:35,699
So that's, like,
secret crying in gym class

731
00:34:35,907 --> 00:34:37,367
some casual racism,
that kind of thing?

732
00:34:39,119 --> 00:34:41,705
Yeah.

733
00:34:41,913 --> 00:34:45,417
I remember that time
really well, actually.

734
00:34:45,625 --> 00:34:47,002
I was a raw nerve.

735
00:34:47,210 --> 00:34:50,463
I felt, like, really
uncomfortable in my body.

736
00:34:50,672 --> 00:34:52,757
I remember one day
I went to school,

737
00:34:52,966 --> 00:34:54,968
and I wore two t-shirts

738
00:34:55,176 --> 00:34:56,803
'cause I thought
it might hide my belly

739
00:34:57,012 --> 00:34:58,221
a little better.

740
00:34:58,430 --> 00:35:00,890
Um, and I was feeling good
about it

741
00:35:01,099 --> 00:35:02,726
until this kid named
Myron Uleski...

742
00:35:02,934 --> 00:35:05,228
came up to me in the
cafeteria, and he was, like,

743
00:35:05,437 --> 00:35:06,855
"hey, man, are you wearing
two t-shirts?

744
00:35:07,063 --> 00:35:09,274
'Cause it makes you look
really fat."

745
00:35:09,482 --> 00:35:10,442
And I was like,

746
00:35:10,650 --> 00:35:12,027
I just tried to laugh it off,

747
00:35:12,235 --> 00:35:16,406
but... my hands were hot
and the room was spinning.

748
00:35:16,615 --> 00:35:17,949
It was awful.

749
00:35:19,784 --> 00:35:21,453
Um...

750
00:35:21,661 --> 00:35:23,038
And at the time, my sister...

751
00:35:23,246 --> 00:35:24,331
I have a younger sister...

752
00:35:24,539 --> 00:35:26,875
She was going
through a lot of stuff.

753
00:35:27,083 --> 00:35:28,585
Um, she was drinking a lot

754
00:35:28,793 --> 00:35:32,255
and just kind of out of control.

755
00:35:32,464 --> 00:35:36,217
She's doing better now,
though, I hear.

756
00:35:36,426 --> 00:35:37,636
And my parents got divorced.

757
00:35:37,844 --> 00:35:38,637
It was tough.

758
00:35:38,845 --> 00:35:40,597
I was raised by my Mom.

759
00:35:40,805 --> 00:35:42,891
She's actually president
of the school board.

760
00:35:43,099 --> 00:35:46,144
She's the reason you can't chew
gum in gym class anymore.

761
00:35:46,353 --> 00:35:47,771
So I'm sorry for that.

762
00:35:47,979 --> 00:35:49,814
I know it's fun
to chew gum in gym.

763
00:35:50,023 --> 00:35:51,358
She's running for mayor now,
actually,

764
00:35:51,566 --> 00:35:54,361
so pretty soon no gum
chewing anywhere, at all.

765
00:35:56,404 --> 00:35:58,073
I love her,

766
00:35:58,281 --> 00:36:00,700
but she can be a little
overbearing, you know,

767
00:36:00,909 --> 00:36:03,703
and she put a lot of pressure
on my sister and me.

768
00:36:05,664 --> 00:36:06,790
But in tenth grade,

769
00:36:06,998 --> 00:36:08,500
I did discover Ned's class.

770
00:36:08,708 --> 00:36:10,960
And that was the first time
I'd ever been on stage,

771
00:36:11,169 --> 00:36:12,796
and I felt like I could be funny

772
00:36:13,004 --> 00:36:14,839
and way less self-conscious
and aggressive and...

773
00:36:15,048 --> 00:36:16,466
You know,
I started doing the plays,

774
00:36:16,675 --> 00:36:18,677
and people recognized me
from the plays

775
00:36:18,885 --> 00:36:21,471
'cause I did this wink and salute thing,
like that. I did it in every play.

776
00:36:21,680 --> 00:36:24,391
Even if it was, like, a sad dramatic
play, I'd do it and people laughed

777
00:36:24,599 --> 00:36:27,352
and they would come up to me in the
hallways and do it back to me.

778
00:36:27,560 --> 00:36:29,020
And I even asked
a girl out that year.

779
00:36:29,229 --> 00:36:33,108
Uh, she said no, but it was...
It was totally worth it.

780
00:36:33,316 --> 00:36:35,110
Okay, let's try something.
You wanna try something?

781
00:36:35,318 --> 00:36:37,028
Can we get two volunteers?

782
00:37:08,518 --> 00:37:10,437
Okay, guys,
here's what I want you to do.

783
00:37:10,645 --> 00:37:12,313
Just be completely honest
with each other.

784
00:37:12,522 --> 00:37:13,857
Just go back and forth

785
00:37:14,065 --> 00:37:15,650
and tell each other
exactly how you feel.

786
00:37:15,859 --> 00:37:17,360
Okay?

787
00:37:20,530 --> 00:37:23,366
Come on, guys.
You can do it.

788
00:37:23,575 --> 00:37:26,161
Um, you are Dana?

789
00:37:26,369 --> 00:37:28,413
You are Melissa.

790
00:37:28,621 --> 00:37:32,125
We are... in chairs.

791
00:37:32,333 --> 00:37:34,127
This is a room.

792
00:37:34,335 --> 00:37:38,173
It's beige... beige-ish.

793
00:37:38,381 --> 00:37:39,799
Well, I mean, actually those
panels are more like an off...

794
00:37:40,008 --> 00:37:41,301
But if you look on that side...

795
00:37:41,509 --> 00:37:43,553
Okay,
focus on each other, girls.

796
00:37:49,017 --> 00:37:53,188
Um, Melissa, you're my friend.

797
00:37:53,396 --> 00:37:55,607
You're my friend, too, Dana.

798
00:37:55,815 --> 00:37:57,984
You're one of my best friends.

799
00:37:58,193 --> 00:38:00,653
Really? I didn't think I was
one of your best friends.

800
00:38:00,862 --> 00:38:03,948
I mean, yeah, you kind of...
You never text me.

801
00:38:04,157 --> 00:38:06,576
You literally never text me.

802
00:38:06,785 --> 00:38:08,036
Well, that's because
you're mean to me a lot.

803
00:38:08,244 --> 00:38:09,829
No, I'm not.
Like what?

804
00:38:10,038 --> 00:38:11,539
Like you literally once told me

805
00:38:11,748 --> 00:38:13,124
that my hair looked like shit

806
00:38:13,333 --> 00:38:14,209
on my birthday.

807
00:38:14,417 --> 00:38:15,835
Okay, I'm sorry.
I was drunk.

808
00:38:16,044 --> 00:38:17,545
I'd just broken up with Patrick,

809
00:38:17,754 --> 00:38:20,006
and I literally drank, like,
a half a bottle of patron.

810
00:38:20,215 --> 00:38:21,132
That's not an excuse.

811
00:38:21,341 --> 00:38:22,467
It was really mean,

812
00:38:22,675 --> 00:38:24,135
and I wanna hang out with you,

813
00:38:24,344 --> 00:38:25,970
but then I end up
feeling like...

814
00:38:26,179 --> 00:38:28,139
I don't know... like shit.

815
00:38:29,265 --> 00:38:31,226
Well...

816
00:38:31,434 --> 00:38:32,811
I guess I'm jealous of you.

817
00:38:33,019 --> 00:38:35,647
Jealous of me?

818
00:38:35,855 --> 00:38:37,065
Why?

819
00:38:37,273 --> 00:38:39,359
I don't know.
Everyone's nice to you.

820
00:38:39,567 --> 00:38:40,819
You're nice to everyone.

821
00:38:41,027 --> 00:38:42,529
Everyone loves you.
You're really pretty.

822
00:38:42,737 --> 00:38:46,241
Well, I-l guess
I'm jealous of you, too.

823
00:38:46,449 --> 00:38:47,867
You're, like, my hero.

824
00:38:50,495 --> 00:38:53,623
Wait, you broke up with Patrick?

825
00:38:53,832 --> 00:38:55,500
He's telling everyone
he broke up with you.

826
00:38:55,708 --> 00:38:57,168
Are you kidding me?

827
00:38:57,377 --> 00:38:59,212
That piece of shit.
I'm gonna key his fucking car.

828
00:38:59,420 --> 00:39:00,505
I'm sorry. Katy told me...

829
00:39:00,713 --> 00:39:03,800
Okay! Great, and scene.
Good job, guys.

830
00:39:04,008 --> 00:39:05,426
Thanks. Right, everybody?

831
00:39:05,635 --> 00:39:07,929
Yes, and go back
to your chairs. Good job.

832
00:39:10,765 --> 00:39:12,016
Hey, Jay.

833
00:39:15,311 --> 00:39:16,479
Hi.

834
00:39:18,314 --> 00:39:19,691
Your bagel looks a little burnt.

835
00:39:19,899 --> 00:39:22,110
Yeah, It's... it's okay.

836
00:39:22,318 --> 00:39:24,279
I mean, yeah,
the outside, uh, is burnt,

837
00:39:24,487 --> 00:39:28,992
but inside it's... its bagel
soul is, uh, it's okay.

838
00:39:29,200 --> 00:39:30,577
It's... It's... it's okay.

839
00:39:31,995 --> 00:39:33,580
You could just...

840
00:39:33,788 --> 00:39:34,831
Take another bagel.

841
00:39:35,039 --> 00:39:36,833
I like this bagel.

842
00:39:37,041 --> 00:39:38,126
This is my bagel.

843
00:39:40,545 --> 00:39:42,463
It's a proud bagel.

844
00:39:51,264 --> 00:39:53,433
Okay, bye, Jay.

845
00:40:08,239 --> 00:40:11,159
Remember your monologues
for Monday, everyone.

846
00:40:11,367 --> 00:40:13,870
And no fucking around.

847
00:40:14,078 --> 00:40:16,247
Man, killed it.

848
00:40:16,456 --> 00:40:18,041
Trading truths.
I love it.

849
00:40:18,249 --> 00:40:20,710
Kind of a Chicago style
improve thing, right?

850
00:40:20,919 --> 00:40:23,004
Hey, Ned, can I talk to you
for a minute?

851
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,214
Sure, man. What's up?

852
00:40:25,423 --> 00:40:28,843
Um, you know, I'm kind of having,
like, a hard time out there in L.A.

853
00:40:29,052 --> 00:40:30,178
Oh yeah.

854
00:40:30,386 --> 00:40:32,221
I mean, I'm doing things
all the time,

855
00:40:32,430 --> 00:40:35,808
but it's just... it can feel like
it's not building to anything,

856
00:40:36,017 --> 00:40:38,269
like kind of random.

857
00:40:38,478 --> 00:40:41,981
And sometimes sort of, like,
hopeless.

858
00:40:42,190 --> 00:40:44,734
I don't know.

859
00:40:44,943 --> 00:40:46,986
I was just thinking maybe
I could use some...

860
00:40:47,195 --> 00:40:49,405
Some of that Sulanaro wisdom.

861
00:40:49,614 --> 00:40:51,491
Yeah, man. Well,
that Sulanaro Wnsoom

862
00:40:51,699 --> 00:40:53,076
can get you
into trouble sometimes.

863
00:40:57,872 --> 00:40:59,916
All right, listen.

864
00:41:00,124 --> 00:41:01,876
You're having a hard time.
Yes?

865
00:41:02,085 --> 00:41:04,587
Of course it's hard. It's supposed
to be fucking hard. Right?

866
00:41:05,630 --> 00:41:06,756
You signed up for this

867
00:41:06,965 --> 00:41:08,633
'cause, unlike most
fucking people,

868
00:41:08,841 --> 00:41:13,221
you had the balls to move out
there and lay it on the line.

869
00:41:13,429 --> 00:41:15,223
You got something to say.

870
00:41:15,431 --> 00:41:16,683
You got a voice.

871
00:41:16,891 --> 00:41:19,268
Respect it.
Keep it clear.

872
00:41:19,477 --> 00:41:20,895
'Cause it's the only voice
that matters.

873
00:41:21,104 --> 00:41:24,065
Not mine.
Not your roommate's.

874
00:41:24,273 --> 00:41:26,067
Not some bullshit agent
at William Morris.

875
00:41:26,275 --> 00:41:29,320
Don't even... don't even listen
to that judgmental bullshit.

876
00:41:29,529 --> 00:41:31,364
Just shut it all out.
Don't negotiate with it.

877
00:41:31,572 --> 00:41:34,033
Shut it all out
and listen to you.

878
00:41:34,242 --> 00:41:36,577
Know what I'm saying?
Yeah. Yeah.

879
00:41:36,786 --> 00:41:38,871
I gotta run.
I got a... I got a meeting,

880
00:41:39,080 --> 00:41:40,832
but if you wanna grab a cup
of coffee or something later...

881
00:41:41,040 --> 00:41:42,250
Yeah, definitely.
How's...

882
00:41:43,668 --> 00:41:46,170
5:20 at the diner?

883
00:41:46,379 --> 00:41:48,297
Sure, man. Sounds good.
I'll see you then.

884
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:52,635
Yeah. I'll see you then.

885
00:41:55,888 --> 00:41:57,682
Keep 'em honest out there.

886
00:42:02,979 --> 00:42:04,772
You should've been there, man.
I was in my element.

887
00:42:04,981 --> 00:42:06,315
I ran this whole exercise,

888
00:42:06,524 --> 00:42:08,109
and Ned... Ned's really lived
a life, man.

889
00:42:08,317 --> 00:42:09,569
I just need to stop at my house.

890
00:42:09,777 --> 00:42:11,571
My Dad needs help
with something.

891
00:42:11,779 --> 00:42:13,281
I don't know if you've seen
his three-episode thing

892
00:42:13,489 --> 00:42:14,866
on "dynasty,"
but he's phenomenal.

893
00:42:15,074 --> 00:42:16,367
You can see the whole thing
at the Paley center.

894
00:42:16,576 --> 00:42:18,077
I mean, he's got this
totally original voice.

895
00:42:18,286 --> 00:42:20,621
He doesn't take shit
from anybody.

896
00:42:20,830 --> 00:42:21,831
That was our turn, man.

897
00:42:22,040 --> 00:42:23,166
Mapquest says make a left.

898
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,834
We're stopping at my house.

899
00:42:25,043 --> 00:42:27,712
What? Okay, first of all,
that street is a huge risk.

900
00:42:27,920 --> 00:42:29,547
And second of all,
we only have 19...

901
00:42:29,756 --> 00:42:31,424
We just have to... stop.

902
00:42:31,632 --> 00:42:33,593
Okay, it just...

903
00:42:33,801 --> 00:42:35,303
Just needs to happen.

904
00:42:36,888 --> 00:42:38,639
Sorry. Ten minutes.

905
00:42:39,724 --> 00:42:42,226
All right. Fine.

906
00:42:53,071 --> 00:42:55,573
Jesus.

907
00:42:55,782 --> 00:42:57,784
Oh, look, channel nine's Jesse
Mitchell's reporting live

908
00:42:57,992 --> 00:42:59,368
from your front lawn.

909
00:42:59,577 --> 00:43:01,204
Okay.

910
00:43:02,330 --> 00:43:03,748
Cover me.

911
00:43:30,691 --> 00:43:33,611
Jay, is that you?
Is it a burglar or is it you?

912
00:43:33,820 --> 00:43:34,821
There's my son.

913
00:43:36,614 --> 00:43:38,324
It still smells
a little bit in here.

914
00:43:38,533 --> 00:43:39,408
Like what?
What are we smelling?

915
00:43:39,617 --> 00:43:40,660
I don't know.

916
00:43:40,868 --> 00:43:41,744
It's like maybe
something's rotting

917
00:43:41,953 --> 00:43:43,329
in the kitchen or something.

918
00:43:43,538 --> 00:43:45,081
That could be.
That might be true.

919
00:43:45,289 --> 00:43:47,708
Let me show you two guys
the situation. Okay?

920
00:43:47,917 --> 00:43:49,377
You remember Spencer, Dad.

921
00:43:49,585 --> 00:43:51,129
Spencer. You used to
come over every day.

922
00:43:51,337 --> 00:43:52,505
Yep.
Hey.

923
00:43:52,713 --> 00:43:53,965
He's visiting from California.

924
00:43:54,173 --> 00:43:55,842
California? Wow. Sunny.

925
00:43:56,050 --> 00:43:56,926
Far away and sunny.

926
00:43:57,135 --> 00:43:58,886
How are you doing?

927
00:43:59,095 --> 00:44:01,472
Ah, terrible. My back feels
like it was shot with an Uzi.

928
00:44:01,681 --> 00:44:03,141
Wow. I'm sorry to hear that.
Sciatica.

929
00:44:03,349 --> 00:44:05,685
I have a few ailments of
my own, so I can relate.

930
00:44:05,893 --> 00:44:07,228
Uh, this is it.
This is what I...

931
00:44:07,436 --> 00:44:08,479
Yeah, just...
Just leave it on the counter.

932
00:44:08,688 --> 00:44:09,981
Okay, let me show you down here

933
00:44:10,189 --> 00:44:11,149
what we've got.

934
00:44:11,357 --> 00:44:12,692
All right, watch your head.

935
00:44:12,900 --> 00:44:14,193
Watch your head.

936
00:44:14,402 --> 00:44:16,279
All right.

937
00:44:19,782 --> 00:44:20,992
Jesus, I remember this room.

938
00:44:21,200 --> 00:44:22,702
Yeah.

939
00:44:22,910 --> 00:44:24,162
Well, gentlemen,

940
00:44:24,370 --> 00:44:26,205
I'm going to be dipping my toes

941
00:44:26,414 --> 00:44:27,957
in the waters
of the dating scene,

942
00:44:28,166 --> 00:44:29,208
and soon enough,

943
00:44:29,417 --> 00:44:31,210
I'm going to be hosting
a young lady

944
00:44:31,419 --> 00:44:33,546
in this furnished basement.

945
00:44:33,754 --> 00:44:35,673
Well, I don't know
if we're going to get you

946
00:44:35,882 --> 00:44:37,008
all the way there today, Dad.

947
00:44:37,216 --> 00:44:38,634
We only have, like...
Nine minutes.

948
00:44:38,843 --> 00:44:39,635
Nine minutes.

949
00:44:39,844 --> 00:44:41,262
Well, move the heavy stuff,

950
00:44:41,470 --> 00:44:43,347
and get Mr. Spencer
to help you out, okay?

951
00:44:43,556 --> 00:44:44,765
Okay.
All right, good luck, boys.

952
00:44:44,974 --> 00:44:46,100
I gotta run.

953
00:44:46,309 --> 00:44:48,561
Whoa, heave ho, don't give up.

954
00:44:59,113 --> 00:45:01,574
Does your Dad really think
he's gonna get laid down here?

955
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,412
I mean, in his heart, yeah.

956
00:45:06,621 --> 00:45:09,707
I think he's just obsessed
with this idea right now.

957
00:45:09,916 --> 00:45:12,752
Like last month it was
old books about trains,

958
00:45:12,960 --> 00:45:14,378
and now it's dating.

959
00:45:19,258 --> 00:45:20,718
Shit, I remember this.

960
00:45:22,595 --> 00:45:24,805
Huh.
Does it still work?

961
00:45:25,014 --> 00:45:26,599
Let's see.

962
00:45:26,807 --> 00:45:27,600
Try the...

963
00:45:27,808 --> 00:45:28,601
Let's see.

964
00:45:29,810 --> 00:45:30,603
Oh, um...

965
00:45:32,813 --> 00:45:34,106
Let me see.

966
00:45:36,901 --> 00:45:38,361
Do you remember it?
I think so.

967
00:45:38,569 --> 00:45:39,737
You wanna try?
Yeah.

968
00:45:39,946 --> 00:45:42,031
Okay, let's do it.
One, two, ready, go.

969
00:46:53,102 --> 00:46:54,812
Did we get a good grade on that?

970
00:46:55,021 --> 00:46:56,397
No, no, he asked for a paper.

971
00:46:56,605 --> 00:46:57,606
Oh, yeah.

972
00:46:57,815 --> 00:46:59,442
He was mad.
I remember that.

973
00:46:59,650 --> 00:47:00,735
He was furious, yeah.

974
00:47:00,943 --> 00:47:02,611
Yeah, he was so mad at us.
Yeah.

975
00:47:02,820 --> 00:47:04,905
He was mainly mad at you
'cause I think I...

976
00:47:05,114 --> 00:47:07,074
Didn't I also write a...
You also wrote a paper.

977
00:47:07,283 --> 00:47:08,951
Yeah, I just...
I just harmonized on that song.

978
00:47:09,160 --> 00:47:10,244
Yeah.

979
00:47:20,129 --> 00:47:21,756
Hey, Dad, we're gonna take off.

980
00:47:21,964 --> 00:47:25,176
Wait a minute,
take a look at these girls.

981
00:47:25,384 --> 00:47:28,804
Lock at this. Each one
is fatter than the next.

982
00:47:29,013 --> 00:47:30,639
I'm sure one of them
is nice, Dad.

983
00:47:30,848 --> 00:47:32,099
Nice? Nice won't get you...

984
00:47:32,308 --> 00:47:33,476
I'm here at
Ellen Kaminski's headquarters

985
00:47:33,684 --> 00:47:34,977
where the mood is...

986
00:47:35,186 --> 00:47:36,562
That cannot be her real nose.

987
00:47:36,771 --> 00:47:38,981
She did something
on the computer.

988
00:47:39,190 --> 00:47:40,441
We're gonna get some.

989
00:47:40,649 --> 00:47:41,859
Wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

990
00:47:42,068 --> 00:47:45,571
Uh, you guys, uh...
Do you want some food?

991
00:47:45,780 --> 00:47:47,990
I g... I got eight boxes
of Mallomars.

992
00:47:48,199 --> 00:47:49,367
You like cookies?

993
00:47:49,575 --> 00:47:51,494
Think we're okay.
I'll take a cookie.

994
00:47:51,702 --> 00:47:53,037
Okay, I love you both.

995
00:47:53,245 --> 00:47:55,331
Come home early.
You're gonna cook.

996
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:58,334
Okay.
How many cookies you want, Spencer?

997
00:47:58,542 --> 00:48:00,086
Uh, just one.

998
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:03,881
Thanks for letting me stop,
Spencer.

999
00:48:04,090 --> 00:48:05,591
It's just, you know,
it's my Dad.

1000
00:48:05,800 --> 00:48:07,468
He just needs help sometimes.

1001
00:48:07,676 --> 00:48:09,470
Yeah, man. Well,
it seems like he's doing good.

1002
00:48:09,678 --> 00:48:11,389
He's definitely gonna make
some lady very happy.

1003
00:48:11,597 --> 00:48:13,015
That basement is very romantic.

1004
00:48:13,224 --> 00:48:14,308
Yeah.

1005
00:48:14,517 --> 00:48:16,102
It's actually...
That's a real thing,

1006
00:48:16,310 --> 00:48:18,521
what he was saying about shorting
your nose on the computer,

1007
00:48:18,729 --> 00:48:19,146
because this one woman
came over there

1008
00:48:19,355 --> 00:48:20,523
a couple weeks ago,

1009
00:48:20,731 --> 00:48:22,483
and her eyes were, like,
really far apart.

1010
00:48:22,691 --> 00:48:24,902
And what had turned out was
that she had actually pushed

1011
00:48:25,111 --> 00:48:26,112
the eyes closer together...

1012
00:48:26,320 --> 00:48:28,280
Oh, no.
What?

1013
00:48:28,489 --> 00:48:31,283
My Mom's calling me, man.
She must've seen me on TV.

1014
00:48:31,492 --> 00:48:34,245
God damn it, Jay, I told you we
should stay off that street.

1015
00:48:34,453 --> 00:48:35,704
I'm sorry, you were on TV?

1016
00:48:35,913 --> 00:48:36,956
You what... when?

1017
00:48:37,164 --> 00:48:38,999
I'm such a fucking asshole.

1018
00:48:39,208 --> 00:48:40,626
You're not doing
anything wrong, Spencer.

1019
00:48:40,835 --> 00:48:43,796
I mean, you're going to
surprise her later, right?

1020
00:48:44,004 --> 00:48:47,007
Like... jump out.

1021
00:48:47,216 --> 00:48:48,801
Look out, man.

1022
00:48:51,387 --> 00:48:52,805
You okay?

1023
00:49:23,878 --> 00:49:25,087
Thank you very much.

1024
00:49:25,296 --> 00:49:27,089
Whoo, all right.

1025
00:49:27,298 --> 00:49:29,717
I'm gonna move this train along.

1026
00:49:29,925 --> 00:49:32,303
Great. Oh,
one quick announcement.

1027
00:49:32,511 --> 00:49:34,638
Lou Morabito is on his way

1028
00:49:34,847 --> 00:49:36,974
to fix the panini press.
Okay?

1029
00:49:37,183 --> 00:49:38,893
So I'm gonna need everyone...
Hey, Davis.

1030
00:49:39,101 --> 00:49:41,061
How do I sign up for this thing?

1031
00:49:41,270 --> 00:49:43,856
Oh, you just put your name
on the list.

1032
00:49:49,820 --> 00:49:53,491
Yeah, hi, I'm gonna be about 16
minutes late to my appointment.

1033
00:49:53,699 --> 00:49:54,783
Kaminski.

1034
00:49:56,952 --> 00:49:58,579
Sorry again, dude.

1035
00:50:21,894 --> 00:50:24,188
Hangovers are the worst, man.

1036
00:50:24,396 --> 00:50:25,606
I never get used to them.

1037
00:50:25,814 --> 00:50:27,316
I mean, I was
so hung over the other day

1038
00:50:27,525 --> 00:50:28,901
even my dog was looking
at me like,

1039
00:50:29,109 --> 00:50:32,029
"you're fucked up, man.
I'm gonna go walk myself."

1040
00:50:34,448 --> 00:50:35,449
Oh.

1041
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:40,412
I, uh... I went to the diner...
Diner today, man.

1042
00:50:40,621 --> 00:50:42,915
Who here likes the diner?
Give it up for the diner.

1043
00:50:43,123 --> 00:50:44,875
I was looking at the menu.

1044
00:50:45,084 --> 00:50:48,212
Uh, yeah, the soups, man.

1045
00:50:48,420 --> 00:50:51,090
Cream of broccoli soup.
Wait. What?

1046
00:50:51,298 --> 00:50:53,259
Does anyone find
that appetizing?

1047
00:50:53,467 --> 00:50:55,970
Why... why are we still calling
it that fucking name?

1048
00:50:57,596 --> 00:50:59,723
Uh...

1049
00:50:59,932 --> 00:51:01,684
Hey, Jay, whatta you say?

1050
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,310
We got Toby's speaker system
for another hour.

1051
00:51:03,519 --> 00:51:04,770
You wanna do something?

1052
00:51:04,979 --> 00:51:06,438
Doesn't that conjure up an image

1053
00:51:06,647 --> 00:51:08,440
of a piece of broccoli
ejaculating?

1054
00:51:08,649 --> 00:51:11,235
What would I do, teach photography?

1055
00:51:11,443 --> 00:51:12,319
Sure, if you want.

1056
00:51:12,528 --> 00:51:16,156
I mean, it's a safe space.

1057
00:51:16,365 --> 00:51:19,076
Uh, dating
is crazy, right? Dating.

1058
00:51:19,285 --> 00:51:21,829
I'm dating this chick right now.

1059
00:51:22,037 --> 00:51:24,957
She's into some wild shit...
Okay, Kevin.

1060
00:51:25,165 --> 00:51:27,710
Thanks for sharing, buddy.
What's up? Did I get the light?

1061
00:51:27,918 --> 00:51:29,962
Uh-huh.

1062
00:51:31,463 --> 00:51:33,090
All right, gang,
we are moving it along.

1063
00:51:33,299 --> 00:51:34,675
Funny stuff, Spencer.

1064
00:51:34,883 --> 00:51:38,387
Okay, up next
we have Jay, everybody!

1065
00:51:38,596 --> 00:51:40,514
Where's Jay?

1066
00:51:46,895 --> 00:51:48,105
Uh, hi.

1067
00:51:48,314 --> 00:51:51,525
Um, uh... I'm Jay.

1068
00:51:51,734 --> 00:51:55,946
I think...
I know almost everyone here.

1069
00:51:56,155 --> 00:51:58,282
Um, hmm.

1070
00:51:58,490 --> 00:51:59,950
What should I d...

1071
00:52:02,244 --> 00:52:03,621
Okay, um...

1072
00:52:03,829 --> 00:52:04,830
Here's a story.

1073
00:52:05,039 --> 00:52:06,498
Uh, so the other day,

1074
00:52:06,707 --> 00:52:08,626
I was walking on Ravensdale,
like, near the library,

1075
00:52:08,834 --> 00:52:13,088
like where Ravensdale hits
the library,

1076
00:52:13,297 --> 00:52:17,718
and all of a sudden I feel like
someone's walking next to me.

1077
00:52:17,926 --> 00:52:18,802
And I look down,

1078
00:52:19,011 --> 00:52:20,179
and it's this dog.

1079
00:52:20,387 --> 00:52:23,140
It's like this scrappy
little dog,

1080
00:52:23,349 --> 00:52:25,225
no collar, no owner, nothing,

1081
00:52:25,434 --> 00:52:26,602
just lockstep with me.

1082
00:52:28,187 --> 00:52:29,647
And I... I was like,

1083
00:52:29,855 --> 00:52:33,734
okay, we're already walking
like two friends.

1084
00:52:33,942 --> 00:52:36,445
"How you doing, Mr. dog?"

1085
00:52:36,654 --> 00:52:38,238
And... and he's looking
at me like,

1086
00:52:38,447 --> 00:52:39,740
"this is pretty"... you know,
he didn't say anything,

1087
00:52:39,948 --> 00:52:41,617
but, you know, he's like...

1088
00:52:41,825 --> 00:52:44,119
Um, we're talking
like that back and forth

1089
00:52:44,328 --> 00:52:45,954
for like, I don't know,

1090
00:52:46,163 --> 00:52:48,374
it felt like... it probably
was only, like, five minutes,

1091
00:52:48,582 --> 00:52:51,627
but it felt like
a really long time, and I...

1092
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:54,171
I feel like...

1093
00:52:54,380 --> 00:52:57,299
For a second there,

1094
00:52:57,508 --> 00:52:59,927
it's like this is
the best friend I ever had.

1095
00:53:01,095 --> 00:53:02,513
You know, whatever problems,

1096
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:04,431
whatever heartache,

1097
00:53:04,640 --> 00:53:08,769
whatever I wanted to say,

1098
00:53:08,977 --> 00:53:11,480
and I felt like I couldn't
to somebody else,

1099
00:53:11,689 --> 00:53:14,650
I could say to this dog
'cause he was my friend,

1100
00:53:14,858 --> 00:53:16,610
and he was there
to listen to me.

1101
00:53:21,365 --> 00:53:24,201
Okay, that's my story.
Thanks, guys.

1102
00:53:28,455 --> 00:53:29,832
Anita's set's getting
more tight.

1103
00:53:30,040 --> 00:53:31,333
Yeah, she's good.

1104
00:53:31,542 --> 00:53:32,876
She's... she's good.
She's definitely good.

1105
00:53:33,085 --> 00:53:35,129
Why'd you cut me off?
I had another two minutes.

1106
00:53:35,337 --> 00:53:37,589
Okay, let's start
by dialing back the attitude.

1107
00:53:37,798 --> 00:53:39,383
You know what? You let
some guitar kid run over,

1108
00:53:39,591 --> 00:53:40,884
and then you cut me off
at three?

1109
00:53:41,093 --> 00:53:42,344
If I had known
how bush-league this thing was,

1110
00:53:42,553 --> 00:53:44,012
I would not have come
to the mic.

1111
00:53:44,221 --> 00:53:46,056
All right, listen, buddy.
Do not cross me right now.

1112
00:53:46,265 --> 00:53:48,976
I was right in the middle of my set.
I was just warming up.

1113
00:53:49,184 --> 00:53:52,104
Nobody in my cafe wants to have hacky
dating bits for ten solid minutes.

1114
00:53:52,312 --> 00:53:53,939
Oh, really? Nobody wants to see me?
Nobody!

1115
00:53:54,148 --> 00:53:56,066
I've got 23,000 subscribers
who want to see me,

1116
00:53:56,275 --> 00:53:57,943
just waiting
for that next video.

1117
00:53:58,152 --> 00:53:59,653
You are sweaty, you are desperate...
Sweaty, huh?

1118
00:53:59,862 --> 00:54:01,530
And I'm exhausted.
You need to go home.

1119
00:54:01,739 --> 00:54:03,282
I'm not going anywhere.

1120
00:54:03,490 --> 00:54:05,576
How many subscribers does
your shitty cafe have, huh?

1121
00:54:05,784 --> 00:54:08,036
I have gone viral.
What have you ever gone?

1122
00:54:08,245 --> 00:54:10,289
Davis, can you check
on that panini press for me?

1123
00:54:10,497 --> 00:54:11,915
Is it a wiring thing?
Or is it a...

1124
00:54:15,753 --> 00:54:17,129
You're banned!

1125
00:54:17,337 --> 00:54:18,964
Me, too?

1126
00:54:19,173 --> 00:54:21,216
No, you had a good set.
You can come back.

1127
00:54:21,425 --> 00:54:24,386
Get off.

1128
00:54:27,389 --> 00:54:29,308
Is your eye okay?
I'm gonna be late.

1129
00:54:29,516 --> 00:54:31,602
Let's not talk.
I don't need to talk right now.

1130
00:54:31,810 --> 00:54:33,479
I just need my doctors.

1131
00:54:33,687 --> 00:54:35,397
Just having...
I'm having heart palpitations,

1132
00:54:35,606 --> 00:54:37,483
and my hands are on fire,

1133
00:54:37,691 --> 00:54:39,026
and l-l-l just know
that it's cancer

1134
00:54:39,234 --> 00:54:40,194
or it's a tumor.

1135
00:54:42,321 --> 00:54:44,990
Jesus Christ, Jay,
are you trying to kill me, too?

1136
00:54:45,199 --> 00:54:46,658
You have cancer, Spencer?

1137
00:54:46,867 --> 00:54:48,410
Is that what you're...

1138
00:54:48,619 --> 00:54:50,704
That's why you got all these doctors.
Oh, my god.

1139
00:54:50,913 --> 00:54:52,498
Jay, I don't know yet.
That... that's the point.

1140
00:54:52,706 --> 00:54:55,042
But do you?
Like, what are your...

1141
00:54:55,250 --> 00:54:57,252
What are your symptoms?
Like, are you...

1142
00:54:57,461 --> 00:55:00,422
Are you going to be okay?
Or...

1143
00:55:00,631 --> 00:55:02,341
You know, I have...

1144
00:55:02,549 --> 00:55:03,550
Cloudiness.

1145
00:55:03,759 --> 00:55:05,010
I feel off.

1146
00:55:05,219 --> 00:55:08,347
I feel, like, not myself.

1147
00:55:08,555 --> 00:55:10,349
I have a rash.

1148
00:55:10,557 --> 00:55:11,767
You know?
I'm not in control.

1149
00:55:11,975 --> 00:55:14,019
It's a whole constellation
of things, Jay.

1150
00:55:14,228 --> 00:55:15,062
It's very clinical.

1151
00:55:15,270 --> 00:55:17,856
So you don't have cancer.

1152
00:55:18,065 --> 00:55:20,526
It doesn't sound like
you have cancer, Spencer.

1153
00:55:20,734 --> 00:55:22,486
I mean, I don't know yet,
technically.

1154
00:55:22,694 --> 00:55:23,654
My labs are still out.

1155
00:55:23,862 --> 00:55:25,072
Why would you say that then?

1156
00:55:25,280 --> 00:55:27,157
It's not a...
It's not a joke.

1157
00:55:27,366 --> 00:55:28,617
It's not a joke.

1158
00:55:30,661 --> 00:55:32,621
I'm sorry.

1159
00:55:35,040 --> 00:55:36,333
I'm sorry.

1160
00:55:43,423 --> 00:55:45,133
Don't lie to me, Spencer.

1161
00:55:50,931 --> 00:55:52,391
I'm flying back tonight.

1162
00:55:56,520 --> 00:55:58,063
L-I'm just here
to see my doctors.

1163
00:55:58,272 --> 00:55:59,606
I'm not seeing anybody.

1164
00:55:59,815 --> 00:56:02,067
I'm not surprising anybody.

1165
00:56:02,276 --> 00:56:04,194
I'm not going to a steakhouse.

1166
00:56:04,403 --> 00:56:05,946
Not going to an art show.

1167
00:56:06,154 --> 00:56:08,031
I just, you know, I...

1168
00:56:08,240 --> 00:56:10,325
I had to do this
'cause I-I've been...

1169
00:56:10,534 --> 00:56:12,160
I've been really scared.
I have this rash.

1170
00:56:12,369 --> 00:56:14,580
I've had it for three months,
and, you know...

1171
00:56:16,790 --> 00:56:19,334
Um, actually I...

1172
00:56:19,543 --> 00:56:22,504
I just remembered I need
to go back to my classroom,

1173
00:56:22,713 --> 00:56:25,883
and so I can't, um,
drive you anymore

1174
00:56:28,385 --> 00:56:31,013
seriously?

1175
00:56:31,221 --> 00:56:33,557
I've got three more doctors.
Can we talk about this?

1176
00:56:36,268 --> 00:56:39,730
Look at me, man.
Can you look at me?

1177
00:56:39,938 --> 00:56:42,816
Jesus, how do you
function like this?

1178
00:56:43,025 --> 00:56:45,861
Jay, if you've got something
to say to me, just say it.

1179
00:56:46,069 --> 00:56:49,197
You wanna call me an asshole,
call me an asshole. Just say it.

1180
00:56:51,241 --> 00:56:53,785
No. No,
'cause you never say anything.

1181
00:56:53,994 --> 00:56:55,537
This is a choice, man.

1182
00:56:55,746 --> 00:56:57,247
You take beautiful
fucking pictures,

1183
00:56:57,456 --> 00:56:58,707
and everybody loves you,

1184
00:56:58,916 --> 00:57:01,418
so you could be a full person

1185
00:57:01,627 --> 00:57:02,836
with reactions and feelings,

1186
00:57:03,045 --> 00:57:06,214
but instead you're
just a doormat.

1187
00:57:06,423 --> 00:57:10,385
You're a walking, talking,
driving doormat.

1188
00:57:13,138 --> 00:57:14,556
You can't even drive.

1189
00:57:18,185 --> 00:57:19,561
I just...

1190
00:57:19,770 --> 00:57:21,772
I have to go back to my job,

1191
00:57:21,980 --> 00:57:26,610
where I have
a lot of responsibility, so...

1192
00:57:26,818 --> 00:57:28,820
Y-you have to go.
I'm sorry.

1193
00:57:34,076 --> 00:57:35,953
You know what?
I don't need you, man.

1194
00:57:36,161 --> 00:57:37,162
I don't need you.

1195
00:57:38,538 --> 00:57:40,374
'Cause I have mapquest.

1196
00:57:40,582 --> 00:57:42,459
Mapquest, motherfucker.

1197
00:58:13,824 --> 00:58:15,367
I'm Spencer kaminski.

1198
00:58:15,575 --> 00:58:17,577
I have an appointment.
I'm sorry I'm late.

1199
00:58:17,786 --> 00:58:19,204
Uh, please take a seat.

1200
00:58:43,020 --> 00:58:44,855
Mr. kaminski?

1201
00:58:52,529 --> 00:58:53,905
Is your eye okay?

1202
00:58:54,114 --> 00:58:57,075
Yeah, yeah, it's nothing.
I'm a... a goalie.

1203
00:58:57,284 --> 00:58:59,369
What seems to be
the problem today?

1204
00:58:59,578 --> 00:59:02,330
You know,
that's kind of p-personal.

1205
00:59:04,541 --> 00:59:08,545
Uh, a bump.
I have a bump...

1206
00:59:08,754 --> 00:59:11,256
On my anus...
Near my anus...

1207
00:59:11,465 --> 00:59:13,008
Right under my anus.

1208
00:59:13,216 --> 00:59:16,678
Okay, well, Dr. Fisher
will be right with you.

1209
00:59:16,887 --> 00:59:18,472
No, no, Dr. Fisher?

1210
00:59:18,680 --> 00:59:20,432
No, I'm here to see
Dr. kaplan.

1211
00:59:20,640 --> 00:59:21,641
Dr. Kaplan's my doctor.

1212
00:59:21,850 --> 00:59:25,062
Oh, you didn't hear?

1213
00:59:25,270 --> 00:59:26,897
Hear what?
I'm sorry to say

1214
00:59:27,105 --> 00:59:29,191
that Dr. kaplan
passed away last year.

1215
00:59:31,318 --> 00:59:33,403
Dr. kaplan died?

1216
00:59:33,612 --> 00:59:35,155
But...

1217
00:59:35,363 --> 00:59:37,240
His name is still on the door.

1218
00:59:37,449 --> 00:59:40,077
Don't worry. Dr. Fisher
is your new proctologist,

1219
00:59:40,285 --> 00:59:41,578
and he's great.

1220
00:59:41,787 --> 00:59:43,497
And he'll be with you
in a minute.

1221
00:59:50,504 --> 00:59:51,922
Dead.

1222
00:59:54,549 --> 00:59:56,468
Mr. kaminski,
nice to meet you.

1223
00:59:56,676 --> 00:59:59,554
So hear we got a little bump
on the anus.

1224
00:59:59,763 --> 01:00:01,348
You're Jasper Fisher's
older brother.

1225
01:00:02,390 --> 01:00:04,184
I am. Yeah.

1226
01:00:04,392 --> 01:00:05,602
I'm sorry.
I don't remember you.

1227
01:00:05,811 --> 01:00:07,229
Is your eye okay?

1228
01:00:07,437 --> 01:00:08,855
Jasper and I were the same year.

1229
01:00:09,064 --> 01:00:11,525
Oh, okay.

1230
01:00:11,733 --> 01:00:12,776
Great

1231
01:00:12,984 --> 01:00:14,361
so you're an ass doctor now?

1232
01:00:14,569 --> 01:00:15,570
I am.

1233
01:00:15,779 --> 01:00:17,989
I'm an ass doctor.

1234
01:00:18,198 --> 01:00:19,407
So what happened
to Dr. kaplan?

1235
01:00:19,616 --> 01:00:20,992
It was a heart attack.

1236
01:00:21,201 --> 01:00:22,661
It's a shame, you know?

1237
01:00:22,869 --> 01:00:23,829
He was the best.

1238
01:00:24,037 --> 01:00:25,247
Yeah.

1239
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,706
He was amazing.

1240
01:00:26,915 --> 01:00:28,750
Yep.

1241
01:00:28,959 --> 01:00:30,794
All right,
so should we take a look?

1242
01:00:32,129 --> 01:00:33,797
How old are you, man?

1243
01:00:34,005 --> 01:00:36,383
You can't possibly be
more than 30.

1244
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:37,968
No, I'm... I'm 33.

1245
01:00:38,176 --> 01:00:40,512
Mm-hm.
And you're a real doctor.

1246
01:00:40,720 --> 01:00:42,305
You're not, like,
a doctor in training?

1247
01:00:42,514 --> 01:00:44,641
No, I'm a real doctor.
Hmm.

1248
01:00:44,850 --> 01:00:46,935
I remember you used to smoke
a lot of weed.

1249
01:00:47,144 --> 01:00:48,728
Didn't you deal weed?

1250
01:00:48,937 --> 01:00:50,772
Hey, Spencer, why don't
you take off those pants,

1251
01:00:50,981 --> 01:00:52,816
take a look at the bump
on your anus.

1252
01:00:53,024 --> 01:00:54,359
I don't think so.
I'm gonna pass.

1253
01:00:54,568 --> 01:00:56,236
'Cause I'm here to see
Dr. kaplan.

1254
01:00:56,444 --> 01:00:59,364
I flew across the country
to see my doctor, Dr. kaplan.

1255
01:00:59,573 --> 01:01:00,699
He brought honor
to this profession,

1256
01:01:00,907 --> 01:01:01,992
this was his temple,

1257
01:01:02,200 --> 01:01:03,535
and you're just
some punk pothead kid

1258
01:01:03,743 --> 01:01:05,871
that I don't know,
and you wanna see my anus.

1259
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:07,539
Okay, well,
Dr. kaplan is dead.

1260
01:01:07,747 --> 01:01:08,915
No, I refuse to accept that.

1261
01:01:09,124 --> 01:01:11,001
I'm not ready to take in
that information.

1262
01:01:11,209 --> 01:01:12,377
Okay, you're starting
to make me mad,

1263
01:01:12,586 --> 01:01:13,461
starting to piss me off.

1264
01:01:13,670 --> 01:01:14,921
How are you a doctor, man?

1265
01:01:15,130 --> 01:01:16,006
Did you cram it all
into two years?

1266
01:01:16,214 --> 01:01:17,382
Did you take a night class?

1267
01:01:17,591 --> 01:01:18,967
Why don't you just take the
pants off

1268
01:01:19,176 --> 01:01:20,427
and show me the bump
on your anus right now.

1269
01:01:20,635 --> 01:01:21,845
You don't deserve
to see my anus.

1270
01:01:22,053 --> 01:01:23,513
You haven't earned that.
Excuse me?

1271
01:01:23,722 --> 01:01:25,348
Fuck this.
I'm going to a real doctor.

1272
01:01:25,557 --> 01:01:27,267
All right, just sit down.

1273
01:01:27,475 --> 01:01:28,935
Look. Sit down.
Are you a fake doctor?

1274
01:01:29,144 --> 01:01:30,729
Don't you push me!
Don't...

1275
01:01:34,649 --> 01:01:36,610
Dr. kaplan forever!

1276
01:01:48,705 --> 01:01:51,249
Spencer?
Can't talk. Gotta go, uncle Dave.

1277
01:02:29,913 --> 01:02:31,581
Hello.

1278
01:02:31,790 --> 01:02:34,417
Betsy, It's... it's Spencer kaminski.
How are you doing?

1279
01:02:34,626 --> 01:02:36,461
Hey, Spencer. Sorry
to keep you waiting.

1280
01:02:36,670 --> 01:02:38,463
You were up early this morning.

1281
01:02:38,672 --> 01:02:41,716
Yep, just, uh, living life
to the fullest.

1282
01:02:41,925 --> 01:02:43,927
Hey, any news on anything?

1283
01:02:44,135 --> 01:02:47,847
Honestly, Spencer, it's
looking like it's not gonna happen.

1284
01:02:48,056 --> 01:02:49,849
Seriously?

1285
01:02:50,058 --> 01:02:51,476
Are you sure?

1286
01:02:51,685 --> 01:02:53,186
Patrick at ABC texted me

1287
01:02:53,395 --> 01:02:56,773
that they're looking
for someone a little burlier.

1288
01:02:56,982 --> 01:02:57,899
Burlier?

1289
01:02:58,108 --> 01:03:01,611
Yeah, burlier.

1290
01:03:01,820 --> 01:03:03,071
You ever wanna die, Betsy?

1291
01:03:03,280 --> 01:03:04,239
What?

1292
01:03:04,447 --> 01:03:05,365
All right. Okay.

1293
01:03:05,573 --> 01:03:07,075
Thanks, Betsy.

1294
01:03:26,344 --> 01:03:27,846
What happened?

1295
01:03:28,054 --> 01:03:29,973
I got punched twice.

1296
01:03:30,181 --> 01:03:32,183
Good lord.

1297
01:03:32,392 --> 01:03:35,020
You must've
really had it coming.

1298
01:03:35,228 --> 01:03:38,023
Well, it's good to see you,
Spencer.

1299
01:03:38,231 --> 01:03:40,108
Yeah, it's good to see you,
too, Dr. Lipman.

1300
01:03:40,317 --> 01:03:41,651
Why don't I get some...

1301
01:03:41,860 --> 01:03:44,154
How's everything?
How are your parents?

1302
01:03:44,362 --> 01:03:46,114
Your uncle came over
last weekend.

1303
01:03:46,323 --> 01:03:47,741
Helped me put up my computer.

1304
01:03:47,949 --> 01:03:49,034
It's a beautiful computer.

1305
01:03:49,242 --> 01:03:50,410
It has the Internet
and everything.

1306
01:03:50,618 --> 01:03:51,661
I'm thrilled with it.

1307
01:03:51,870 --> 01:03:54,080
They must be happy to see you.

1308
01:03:54,289 --> 01:03:57,042
Honestly, Lipman,
they don't even know I'm here.

1309
01:03:58,084 --> 01:04:00,003
What? Spencer...

1310
01:04:00,211 --> 01:04:01,588
I'm just here to see my doctors

1311
01:04:01,796 --> 01:04:03,423
and then I'm going
back to L.A.,

1312
01:04:03,631 --> 01:04:05,216
flying back tonight.

1313
01:04:05,425 --> 01:04:07,594
You are aware that they have
doctors in California, right?

1314
01:04:07,802 --> 01:04:09,054
We didn't invent them here.

1315
01:04:09,262 --> 01:04:11,556
Yeah, I just, uh...

1316
01:04:11,765 --> 01:04:12,891
I feel sick.

1317
01:04:13,099 --> 01:04:15,935
You know, I feel not myself.

1318
01:04:16,144 --> 01:04:17,270
I feel like I'm dying.

1319
01:04:17,479 --> 01:04:18,897
Inn:

1320
01:04:19,105 --> 01:04:20,315
Maybe that's stupid,

1321
01:04:20,523 --> 01:04:23,485
but I've just been really...
Really worried.

1322
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:25,111
And...

1323
01:04:25,320 --> 01:04:27,155
I-I was thinking it could be
Lou Gehrig's disease,

1324
01:04:27,364 --> 01:04:29,115
so I brought some stuff.

1325
01:04:29,324 --> 01:04:31,242
I don't know if you wanna take a look.
It's all new stuff.

1326
01:04:31,451 --> 01:04:32,786
It's new stuff and it's very...

1327
01:04:32,994 --> 01:04:37,582
Spencer, I've known you
for your whole life. Yeah?

1328
01:04:37,791 --> 01:04:39,918
I remember when you were
a cranky little baby.

1329
01:04:40,126 --> 01:04:41,795
I remember when you were
11 years old.

1330
01:04:42,003 --> 01:04:44,297
You sat right there. You told
me you had a girlfriend.

1331
01:04:44,506 --> 01:04:45,673
Lindsay. She dumped me. Yeah.

1332
01:04:45,882 --> 01:04:47,675
I remember when you broke
your leg skiing.

1333
01:04:47,884 --> 01:04:50,178
I remember when we figured out you
were allergic to raspberries,

1334
01:04:50,387 --> 01:04:52,889
and that's why you were having
such a bad time at camp.

1335
01:04:53,098 --> 01:04:54,474
I think I've known you
long enough

1336
01:04:54,682 --> 01:04:57,519
that you can cut the bullshit
a little bit.

1337
01:04:57,727 --> 01:04:59,187
Yeah.

1338
01:04:59,396 --> 01:05:00,563
It's just, uh...

1339
01:05:02,774 --> 01:05:04,651
I have weird marks on my back.

1340
01:05:04,859 --> 01:05:06,569
And I've got hard-edged cracks
in my mouth.

1341
01:05:06,778 --> 01:05:08,154
I've got a bump under my anus.

1342
01:05:08,363 --> 01:05:10,031
I have a rash
that won't go away.

1343
01:05:10,240 --> 01:05:12,075
I've got hot feelings
on my face.

1344
01:05:12,283 --> 01:05:14,077
And I... I just... you know,

1345
01:05:14,285 --> 01:05:15,328
I don't know.

1346
01:05:16,913 --> 01:05:18,790
I don't know.

1347
01:05:18,998 --> 01:05:21,584
You know,
I saw your sister last week.

1348
01:05:21,793 --> 01:05:23,044
She's doing good.

1349
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,630
It's not easy,
but she's doing it.

1350
01:05:25,839 --> 01:05:29,008
Her counselor's one of the guys on
my softball team. He's a great guy.

1351
01:05:29,217 --> 01:05:31,636
Amazing shortstop.

1352
01:05:31,845 --> 01:05:32,762
Yeah? That's good.

1353
01:05:32,971 --> 01:05:34,139
Yeah, you should go see her.

1354
01:05:34,347 --> 01:05:36,349
She's living at home.

1355
01:05:36,558 --> 01:05:37,809
Five minutes from here.

1356
01:05:38,017 --> 01:05:39,644
I should go see her.
I get it.

1357
01:05:39,853 --> 01:05:41,438
I should.

1358
01:05:41,646 --> 01:05:43,440
I never call her.
She probably hates me.

1359
01:05:43,648 --> 01:05:45,024
I just-.

1360
01:05:45,233 --> 01:05:46,901
I can't be home right now.

1361
01:05:47,110 --> 01:05:48,278
Well, you are home, right?

1362
01:05:48,486 --> 01:05:49,612
You know what I mean.

1363
01:05:49,821 --> 01:05:51,489
I can't wake up in that bed

1364
01:05:51,698 --> 01:05:53,283
and eat breakfast at that table.

1365
01:05:53,491 --> 01:05:54,659
You know? I just...

1366
01:05:54,868 --> 01:05:57,203
I don't want them to see me
like this.

1367
01:05:57,412 --> 01:06:01,332
I wanna be here, Lipman.
I do, but I just...

1368
01:06:01,541 --> 01:06:02,750
I can't.

1369
01:06:02,959 --> 01:06:04,586
All right, wait a minute.
Wait a minute.

1370
01:06:04,794 --> 01:06:06,463
Can you breathe?
No.

1371
01:06:06,671 --> 01:06:09,340
Can you take a long one
right down to the diaphragm?

1372
01:06:09,549 --> 01:06:11,092
Yes, that's good.

1373
01:06:11,301 --> 01:06:13,720
Longer.
Can you go farther down?

1374
01:06:13,928 --> 01:06:14,888
There you go.

1375
01:06:15,096 --> 01:06:17,432
Another one.

1376
01:06:17,640 --> 01:06:19,142
That's good.

1377
01:06:22,061 --> 01:06:23,521
Spencer...

1378
01:06:25,940 --> 01:06:31,112
Now, after medical school,
I did my residency at UCLA.

1379
01:06:31,321 --> 01:06:33,656
I remember going out there.

1380
01:06:33,865 --> 01:06:35,283
Sunny California.

1381
01:06:36,951 --> 01:06:39,412
I felt like my life was
taking off on a rocket,

1382
01:06:39,621 --> 01:06:41,915
like I could do anything.

1383
01:06:42,123 --> 01:06:45,960
I was surrounded by brilliant,
ambitious people.

1384
01:06:46,169 --> 01:06:48,087
All of them I respected.

1385
01:06:48,296 --> 01:06:49,506
And they all respected me.

1386
01:06:49,714 --> 01:06:52,467
I worked and I fell in love,

1387
01:06:52,675 --> 01:06:55,136
and for the first time,

1388
01:06:55,345 --> 01:06:57,388
really felt like a man.

1389
01:06:57,597 --> 01:06:59,516
But I'll never forget.

1390
01:06:59,724 --> 01:07:03,019
One day...

1391
01:07:03,228 --> 01:07:04,896
I think it was a Sunday...

1392
01:07:05,104 --> 01:07:08,149
I started to feel
a numbness in my fingers.

1393
01:07:09,859 --> 01:07:11,194
I was feeling fatigued.

1394
01:07:11,402 --> 01:07:13,238
I was getting these headaches.

1395
01:07:13,446 --> 01:07:15,114
And I realized

1396
01:07:15,323 --> 01:07:17,825
it was symptomatic
of Kohler's disease.

1397
01:07:18,034 --> 01:07:19,077
Kohler's disease?

1398
01:07:19,285 --> 01:07:20,954
It's multiple myeloma,

1399
01:07:21,162 --> 01:07:22,705
cancer of the plasma cells.

1400
01:07:24,290 --> 01:07:26,209
And all I could think about
for weeks was,

1401
01:07:26,417 --> 01:07:27,335
do I have the symptoms?

1402
01:07:27,544 --> 01:07:28,628
I think my bones hurt.

1403
01:07:28,836 --> 01:07:31,339
I think my spine and ribs hurt.

1404
01:07:31,548 --> 01:07:32,465
Maybe I'm anemic.

1405
01:07:32,674 --> 01:07:34,092
I feel faint.

1406
01:07:34,300 --> 01:07:37,053
It went on and on and on...

1407
01:07:37,262 --> 01:07:38,846
Do you think that I have...
No.

1408
01:07:39,055 --> 01:07:41,140
No. Just listen to me
for a second.

1409
01:07:41,349 --> 01:07:43,351
So eventually,

1410
01:07:43,560 --> 01:07:44,602
I was so worked up

1411
01:07:44,811 --> 01:07:47,188
that I made another resident
test me.

1412
01:07:47,397 --> 01:07:49,065
I had blood tests,

1413
01:07:49,274 --> 01:07:51,734
my skull, my skeleton,

1414
01:07:51,943 --> 01:07:54,112
my long bones, all x-rayed.

1415
01:07:56,489 --> 01:07:58,700
I was literally shaking
as I waited for the results.

1416
01:07:58,908 --> 01:08:00,994
I actually thought to myself,

1417
01:08:01,202 --> 01:08:02,912
okay, this is it.

1418
01:08:03,121 --> 01:08:04,664
I know I have this disease,

1419
01:08:04,872 --> 01:08:06,249
and this is going to be

1420
01:08:06,457 --> 01:08:08,960
what the rest of my life
is going to look like.

1421
01:08:09,168 --> 01:08:10,461
No family.

1422
01:08:10,670 --> 01:08:12,005
No job.

1423
01:08:12,213 --> 01:08:13,256
Nothing at all

1424
01:08:13,464 --> 01:08:16,384
but me and this disease.

1425
01:08:16,593 --> 01:08:18,177
And for a second there,

1426
01:08:18,386 --> 01:08:19,846
I wanted that.

1427
01:08:22,599 --> 01:08:24,767
I... I welcomed the...

1428
01:08:26,060 --> 01:08:27,353
Simplicity of that, I guess.

1429
01:08:28,980 --> 01:08:32,150
But then I look over
at my then girlfriend,

1430
01:08:32,358 --> 01:08:34,110
soon to be wife,

1431
01:08:34,319 --> 01:08:37,030
waiting next to me,
holding my hand,

1432
01:08:37,238 --> 01:08:38,781
worrying about me,

1433
01:08:38,990 --> 01:08:40,450
hoping that I'm okay.

1434
01:08:42,869 --> 01:08:44,370
And the moment passed.

1435
01:08:51,753 --> 01:08:53,921
And if the niners had covered
the spread that year,

1436
01:08:54,130 --> 01:08:55,256
we'd still be married.

1437
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:56,633
Lost pretty much everything.

1438
01:08:56,841 --> 01:08:58,968
Never buy a boat, Spencer.

1439
01:08:59,177 --> 01:09:01,220
The insurance alone
is gonna kill you.

1440
01:09:01,429 --> 01:09:03,139
So you didn't have
Kohler's disease?

1441
01:09:03,348 --> 01:09:04,974
Maybe you just need
a good night's sleep.

1442
01:09:05,183 --> 01:09:07,769
Did you ever think of that?
Drink a glass of water maybe.

1443
01:09:07,977 --> 01:09:09,812
Yeah.

1444
01:09:10,021 --> 01:09:12,357
Yeah.
Okay, let's start with the rash.

1445
01:09:37,256 --> 01:09:39,300
Uh, so what's going on
with you and Ned?

1446
01:09:39,509 --> 01:09:41,594
Is it serious or, um...

1447
01:09:42,929 --> 01:09:44,347
Um...

1448
01:09:46,057 --> 01:09:47,225
Is this a good time?

1449
01:09:47,433 --> 01:09:48,810
Jay, what are you talking about?

1450
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,312
It's just I know that you guys
are a thing now,

1451
01:09:51,521 --> 01:09:52,522
and so I was just...

1452
01:09:52,730 --> 01:09:53,773
I was just curious if, like...

1453
01:09:53,981 --> 01:09:55,858
If you loved him or...

1454
01:09:57,860 --> 01:09:59,362
Um, I don't... I don't...

1455
01:09:59,570 --> 01:10:01,656
Look, Jay, I don't really know
how to answer that.

1456
01:10:01,864 --> 01:10:03,574
Sure. It's a tough question.

1457
01:10:03,783 --> 01:10:04,909
I get that.

1458
01:10:05,118 --> 01:10:06,661
Sorry.
Jay, this really...

1459
01:10:06,869 --> 01:10:09,372
This isn't, like, a good time.
Look, Lisa, I just...

1460
01:10:09,580 --> 01:10:11,833
I know that I'm not, um,

1461
01:10:12,041 --> 01:10:13,793
attractive enough for you,

1462
01:10:14,001 --> 01:10:16,254
and I know that
I'm sort of fattish

1463
01:10:16,462 --> 01:10:17,672
and weird looking,

1464
01:10:17,880 --> 01:10:19,632
and I know that I did that thing

1465
01:10:19,841 --> 01:10:20,925
with your ear

1466
01:10:21,134 --> 01:10:22,969
when we were
above the bookstore,

1467
01:10:23,177 --> 01:10:24,512
and I apologize for that.

1468
01:10:24,721 --> 01:10:25,805
I apologize again.

1469
01:10:26,013 --> 01:10:27,390
Jay, Jay...
I know that I don't

1470
01:10:27,598 --> 01:10:30,017
always pick up on social cues.

1471
01:10:30,226 --> 01:10:33,104
I know that I have problems.

1472
01:10:33,312 --> 01:10:35,690
I have a whole bathtub
full of problems.

1473
01:10:35,898 --> 01:10:38,234
But, I mean...

1474
01:10:38,443 --> 01:10:40,319
You're not perfect either.

1475
01:10:42,864 --> 01:10:44,782
You know?

1476
01:10:44,991 --> 01:10:49,287
And that was what was so amazing

1477
01:10:49,495 --> 01:10:51,330
about the, um...

1478
01:10:51,539 --> 01:10:55,209
The, uh...
Above the bookstore time.

1479
01:10:57,837 --> 01:10:59,255
About being with you.

1480
01:10:59,464 --> 01:11:01,883
I mean, that we weren't perfect.

1481
01:11:03,384 --> 01:11:05,052
It made me feel a lot better

1482
01:11:05,261 --> 01:11:06,721
about not being perfect.

1483
01:11:08,931 --> 01:11:13,019
And even if your hair
all fell out

1484
01:11:13,227 --> 01:11:14,187
and you were completely bald,

1485
01:11:14,395 --> 01:11:15,271
I wouldn't even care.

1486
01:11:22,528 --> 01:11:23,988
I, um...

1487
01:11:25,656 --> 01:11:28,367
I don't know, Jay.
It's...

1488
01:11:28,576 --> 01:11:29,952
I don't think we...

1489
01:11:30,161 --> 01:11:32,330
I don't think
we feel the same way about...

1490
01:11:35,917 --> 01:11:36,876
It's just no.

1491
01:11:37,084 --> 01:11:39,587
Lt... the answer's no.

1492
01:11:39,796 --> 01:11:41,964
It's not...
It's not going to work out.

1493
01:11:46,511 --> 01:11:50,306
I just wanna, um, chime in here

1494
01:11:50,515 --> 01:11:53,267
and say I've never felt more
awkward in my entire life.

1495
01:11:55,102 --> 01:11:59,607
Right, sure, uh... and that's...
That's okay.

1496
01:11:59,816 --> 01:12:01,526
I expected this.
Honestly.

1497
01:12:01,734 --> 01:12:03,903
I just wanted you to know

1498
01:12:04,111 --> 01:12:06,781
that these are the feelings
that I'm feeling.

1499
01:12:06,989 --> 01:12:08,699
Whatever you're feeling
is fine...

1500
01:12:10,493 --> 01:12:12,703
But this is how I'm feeling.

1501
01:12:12,912 --> 01:12:16,374
Now you know
and that's all I wanted.

1502
01:12:17,667 --> 01:12:19,836
To feel...
To feel the feelings.

1503
01:12:23,047 --> 01:12:24,632
Okay?

1504
01:12:25,758 --> 01:12:27,510
Okay.

1505
01:12:27,718 --> 01:12:31,305
Okay. Well, I think I love you,
but I'll talk to you later.

1506
01:13:26,611 --> 01:13:29,405
Hey, Ned.
Hi, Spencer. How's it going, buddy?

1507
01:13:29,614 --> 01:13:31,157
Still thinking about
that trading truth shit

1508
01:13:31,365 --> 01:13:33,701
from today.
It's killer stuff.

1509
01:13:33,910 --> 01:13:36,287
So listen up, man?
What's eating at you?

1510
01:13:36,495 --> 01:13:37,914
You going out auditioning
and shit?

1511
01:13:38,122 --> 01:13:39,081
Getting seen?

1512
01:13:39,290 --> 01:13:41,459
That L.A. scene is crazy.

1513
01:13:41,667 --> 01:13:43,252
Yeah, well,
it's definitely tough.

1514
01:13:43,461 --> 01:13:45,546
Yeah. You just gotta stick it
out, man.

1515
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:47,381
When I was your age,
I was ruthless.

1516
01:13:47,590 --> 01:13:49,592
I was knocking
on all kinds of doors,

1517
01:13:49,800 --> 01:13:51,552
mailing all kinds of shit
to peop...

1518
01:13:59,977 --> 01:14:02,772
piece of shit thing.

1519
01:14:02,980 --> 01:14:05,066
Can I get your something?

1520
01:14:05,274 --> 01:14:08,611
Oh, uh, cream of broccoli soup, please?
Sure.

1521
01:14:08,819 --> 01:14:10,488
Anyway,
you can't back off of them.

1522
01:14:10,696 --> 01:14:12,365
'Cause the minute you do,
they're just gonna...

1523
01:14:12,573 --> 01:14:14,033
What's going on
with you and Lisa?

1524
01:14:14,241 --> 01:14:15,952
It's complicated, man.

1525
01:14:16,160 --> 01:14:17,036
Uh-huh.
It's very complicated.

1526
01:14:17,244 --> 01:14:18,621
What happened to your eye?

1527
01:14:18,829 --> 01:14:21,666
Oh, nothing, nothing,
I got punched by a doctor.

1528
01:14:21,874 --> 01:14:24,377
What's your game plan there
with Lisa?

1529
01:14:24,585 --> 01:14:27,964
Oh, I don't know if we should
get into all that.

1530
01:14:28,172 --> 01:14:30,758
Come on, man.
I'm not in high school anymore.

1531
01:14:30,967 --> 01:14:32,009
I can take it.

1532
01:14:32,218 --> 01:14:33,928
Let's trade truths.

1533
01:14:34,136 --> 01:14:35,596
I'll go first.

1534
01:14:35,805 --> 01:14:38,265
I was a seat filler at
the people's choice awards,

1535
01:14:38,474 --> 01:14:39,642
and they asked me to leave

1536
01:14:39,850 --> 01:14:42,061
'cause I couldn't stop crying.

1537
01:14:42,269 --> 01:14:43,980
Okay, man.
All right, now it's your turn.

1538
01:14:44,188 --> 01:14:46,065
What's going on with Lisa?
What's...

1539
01:14:46,273 --> 01:14:49,276
I mean, I don't think
she knows what she wants.

1540
01:14:49,485 --> 01:14:51,821
We've been sort of
on again, off again

1541
01:14:52,029 --> 01:14:53,072
for a couple of months.

1542
01:14:53,280 --> 01:14:54,949
You know, we're having fun.

1543
01:14:55,157 --> 01:14:55,950
She's a good kid,

1544
01:14:56,158 --> 01:14:58,452
but...

1545
01:14:58,661 --> 01:14:59,912
Different worlds,

1546
01:15:00,121 --> 01:15:02,206
different generations, you know?

1547
01:15:02,415 --> 01:15:06,085
Just trying to keep that shit
at arm's length.

1548
01:15:06,293 --> 01:15:08,671
And you're married.

1549
01:15:08,879 --> 01:15:10,881
Right. Yeah.

1550
01:15:13,050 --> 01:15:14,593
Remember junior year,

1551
01:15:14,802 --> 01:15:17,304
when you had us just go
on stage and yell "fuck you"?

1552
01:15:17,513 --> 01:15:20,141
Yeah, sure.
It's my favorite exercise.

1553
01:15:20,349 --> 01:15:23,436
I'd start class with that every day
if it wasn't for camera phones.

1554
01:15:23,644 --> 01:15:26,313
Can't no half my old shit.

1555
01:15:38,701 --> 01:15:41,579
Listen, Ned,

1556
01:15:41,787 --> 01:15:43,873
I think you're
a really good guy,

1557
01:15:44,081 --> 01:15:46,417
and I've always looked up
to you.

1558
01:15:46,625 --> 01:15:49,754
I still do, but...

1559
01:15:49,962 --> 01:15:53,257
Here you go.
Thank you.

1560
01:15:53,466 --> 01:15:54,675
Yeah.

1561
01:15:54,884 --> 01:15:56,135
I have this friend.

1562
01:15:56,343 --> 01:15:59,180
He's the nicest guy
in the whole world.

1563
01:15:59,388 --> 01:16:01,599
And he never says fuck you
to anybody.

1564
01:16:01,807 --> 01:16:03,851
And I've been thinking.

1565
01:16:04,060 --> 01:16:06,187
This guy, he must be miserable.

1566
01:16:06,395 --> 01:16:09,940
I mean,
how does he live like that?

1567
01:16:10,149 --> 01:16:13,652
But in reality

1568
01:16:13,861 --> 01:16:15,404
he's a lot happier than I am...

1569
01:16:17,323 --> 01:16:19,366
Happier than both of us,
probably.

1570
01:16:22,036 --> 01:16:23,079
Truth is, man,

1571
01:16:23,287 --> 01:16:24,413
let's face it.

1572
01:16:24,622 --> 01:16:26,082
You can't yell fuck you forever.

1573
01:16:26,290 --> 01:16:28,209
You can't push people away
like that...

1574
01:16:30,252 --> 01:16:32,213
Not to mention,
it's kind of messed up

1575
01:16:32,421 --> 01:16:34,965
to make a whole classroom
full of kids yell curse words.

1576
01:16:35,174 --> 01:16:36,842
You know,
at least make that optional.

1577
01:16:37,051 --> 01:16:38,344
I'm just saying. It's...

1578
01:16:38,552 --> 01:16:40,054
Jesus Christ, man.

1579
01:16:40,262 --> 01:16:43,182
I thought you wanted to talk
about agents or some shit.

1580
01:16:43,390 --> 01:16:45,643
Yeah.

1581
01:16:45,851 --> 01:16:47,269
I got an appointment.

1582
01:16:47,478 --> 01:16:48,646
What the fuck, man?

1583
01:16:48,854 --> 01:16:50,231
That's it?

1584
01:16:51,816 --> 01:16:53,567
Keep 'em honest out there, Ned.

1585
01:17:32,690 --> 01:17:37,486
Jay! Where are my long socks?

1586
01:17:44,368 --> 01:17:45,661
That's not a weatherman!

1587
01:17:45,870 --> 01:17:47,288
A weatherman should look

1588
01:17:47,496 --> 01:17:49,999
like they've been outside
for days,

1589
01:17:50,207 --> 01:17:53,210
and they just look like they've
been killed by the weather.

1590
01:17:53,419 --> 01:17:56,255
This person looks like they
came from the rainbow room.

1591
01:17:56,463 --> 01:17:58,132
Why does everybody look
like they came

1592
01:17:58,340 --> 01:18:02,386
from the rainbow room
on television, giving the news?

1593
01:18:35,419 --> 01:18:36,503
Sorry.

1594
01:18:39,465 --> 01:18:40,549
Hello, Betsy?

1595
01:18:40,758 --> 01:18:42,718
They wanna see you again.

1596
01:18:42,927 --> 01:18:45,638
What? What happened with not being
stocky enough or whatever it was?

1597
01:18:45,846 --> 01:18:50,142
Patrick saw another photo
and said you looked way burlier.

1598
01:18:50,351 --> 01:18:52,436
Yeah, yeah, I know that photo.

1599
01:18:52,645 --> 01:18:55,814
Well, that's... great news.

1600
01:18:56,023 --> 01:18:57,358
Yeah, it's really fucking great.

1601
01:18:57,566 --> 01:18:59,401
Let's get you in there
as soon as possible.

1602
01:18:59,610 --> 01:19:01,612
Let's do tomorrow at noon.

1603
01:19:01,820 --> 01:19:05,324
Bring a headshot and maybe throw "shitty
brother-in-law" on a thumb drive, okay?

1604
01:19:05,532 --> 01:19:06,742
See you there, Spencer.

1605
01:19:18,003 --> 01:19:21,298
Jay.
Hi, Jo.

1606
01:19:21,507 --> 01:19:23,509
Hey.

1607
01:19:26,053 --> 01:19:27,554
Hey.
Hey, what's up?

1608
01:19:27,763 --> 01:19:29,848
Not much.
What are you doing?

1609
01:19:30,057 --> 01:19:33,644
Uh, my family does not sort out
the recycling from the garbage,

1610
01:19:33,852 --> 01:19:35,646
so I do it...

1611
01:19:35,854 --> 01:19:38,899
The end of the week,
and it's disgusting.

1612
01:19:40,818 --> 01:19:42,903
Um, how was your thing today?

1613
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,656
My thing?
You mean rehab, Jay?

1614
01:19:45,864 --> 01:19:47,574
Yeah, yeah.

1615
01:19:47,783 --> 01:19:48,993
It's okay.
Sorry.

1616
01:19:49,201 --> 01:19:51,245
I'm an outpatient,
so I get there at 9:00

1617
01:19:51,453 --> 01:19:52,788
and leave at 5:00.

1618
01:19:52,997 --> 01:19:55,332
Um, it's like having a job

1619
01:19:55,541 --> 01:19:57,001
but with no emotional
boundaries.

1620
01:19:57,209 --> 01:19:58,502
It's... it's odd.
Uh-huh.

1621
01:19:58,711 --> 01:20:00,879
Yeah.

1622
01:20:01,088 --> 01:20:02,423
How was your day?

1623
01:20:02,631 --> 01:20:06,593
Um, it's kind of like that too,
actually.

1624
01:20:08,470 --> 01:20:10,889
So how's your brother doing?

1625
01:20:11,098 --> 01:20:12,641
Have you...

1626
01:20:12,850 --> 01:20:14,184
And I can't even imagine.

1627
01:20:14,393 --> 01:20:16,478
You know, I've seen him
on the Internet and stuff.

1628
01:20:16,687 --> 01:20:19,189
It's like, California,

1629
01:20:19,398 --> 01:20:21,525
far away and sunny.

1630
01:20:21,734 --> 01:20:23,986
How does he seem to you?

1631
01:20:25,321 --> 01:20:26,280
L-I haven't...

1632
01:20:26,488 --> 01:20:27,865
I haven't talked
to him in, uh...

1633
01:20:28,073 --> 01:20:30,284
0l-|... ls...
Jay, it's fine.

1634
01:20:30,492 --> 01:20:32,411
I know you've been driving him
around all day.

1635
01:20:34,371 --> 01:20:36,623
Wha-what? No. We...

1636
01:20:36,832 --> 01:20:38,876
My mother still doesn't know,
and she can't know.

1637
01:20:39,084 --> 01:20:40,461
I'm s... okay...
So stop.

1638
01:20:40,669 --> 01:20:41,670
I'm sorry. I just...

1639
01:20:41,879 --> 01:20:44,965
Wow. Okay, so do...

1640
01:20:45,174 --> 01:20:46,342
Do other people know?

1641
01:20:46,550 --> 01:20:47,926
Yeah, I got a couple calls,
actually.

1642
01:20:48,135 --> 01:20:51,013
Oh, did Antoinette
really punch him in the eye?

1643
01:20:52,056 --> 01:20:53,015
Yeah, she, like...

1644
01:20:54,058 --> 01:20:55,309
Wound up

1645
01:20:55,517 --> 01:20:57,978
god, poor guy.

1646
01:21:03,150 --> 01:21:04,026
I'm... I'm sorry.

1647
01:21:04,234 --> 01:21:06,153
Why is he a poor guy?

1648
01:21:06,362 --> 01:21:08,238
Jo, he comes here.

1649
01:21:08,447 --> 01:21:09,865
He runs around,

1650
01:21:10,074 --> 01:21:11,033
hiding from you guys.

1651
01:21:11,241 --> 01:21:12,868
Don't you just wanna...

1652
01:21:13,077 --> 01:21:15,287
Like grab him
and just, like, shake him?

1653
01:21:15,496 --> 01:21:17,039
Like, aren't you angry?

1654
01:21:17,247 --> 01:21:18,874
Are you angry?
You seem angry.

1655
01:21:19,083 --> 01:21:20,709
I don't know.
It's just he...

1656
01:21:20,959 --> 01:21:23,212
All he cares about
is his "dog walkers"

1657
01:21:23,420 --> 01:21:24,630
and his made up health problems.

1658
01:21:24,838 --> 01:21:26,006
He doesn't even wanna be here.

1659
01:21:26,215 --> 01:21:28,050
I think,
if he didn't want to be here,

1660
01:21:28,258 --> 01:21:29,218
he wouldn't be here.

1661
01:21:29,426 --> 01:21:30,969
I think he just hit a wall,

1662
01:21:31,178 --> 01:21:32,429
and he needed to come home.

1663
01:21:32,638 --> 01:21:34,264
I just think
he's going about it wrong

1664
01:21:34,473 --> 01:21:35,432
'cause he is...

1665
01:21:36,517 --> 01:21:37,684
An idiot.

1666
01:21:39,436 --> 01:21:40,854
And, I don't know,

1667
01:21:41,063 --> 01:21:42,064
scared?

1668
01:21:43,357 --> 01:21:44,775
Yeah.

1669
01:21:44,983 --> 01:21:47,319
Did you say he's walking dogs?

1670
01:21:47,528 --> 01:21:51,824
No, it's like he loves the dogs
but he's conflicted about it.

1671
01:21:52,032 --> 01:21:55,077
Just the dogs in his life?

1672
01:21:55,285 --> 01:21:56,745
I.-

1673
01:21:58,956 --> 01:22:00,791
Mom?

1674
01:22:05,003 --> 01:22:06,380
The ophthalmologist, Ellen!

1675
01:22:10,884 --> 01:22:11,844
Come on.

1676
01:22:12,052 --> 01:22:13,011
I don't...
I don't really...

1677
01:22:13,220 --> 01:22:14,513
No, we gotta go.
Come on.

1678
01:22:31,530 --> 01:22:34,616
I'm just going
to fully dilate your eyes.

1679
01:22:35,909 --> 01:22:38,245
It'll take few moments.

1680
01:23:00,058 --> 01:23:02,227
There's a... a car.
Yeah, man, safety first.

1681
01:23:20,370 --> 01:23:21,622
Oh, that's a great idea.

1682
01:23:21,830 --> 01:23:24,208
Yeah, yeah, yeah.
Absolutely. Okay.

1683
01:23:24,416 --> 01:23:25,751
Appreciative of your vote,

1684
01:23:26,001 --> 01:23:27,794
and it was so great
running into you.

1685
01:23:28,003 --> 01:23:28,837
Really, really, really...

1686
01:23:30,797 --> 01:23:32,799
All my prayers.
It means so much to us.

1687
01:23:33,008 --> 01:23:34,343
We really appreciate it.

1688
01:23:39,139 --> 01:23:40,766
If you've got some volunteers,
I'm telling you.

1689
01:23:40,974 --> 01:23:42,601
Take these brochures.
Put this on their cars.

1690
01:23:42,809 --> 01:23:44,269
We could really use the support.

1691
01:23:52,069 --> 01:23:53,570
Ellen?

1692
01:23:53,779 --> 01:23:55,989
What is it?

1693
01:23:56,198 --> 01:23:57,616
I'm not sure.

1694
01:24:01,537 --> 01:24:02,704
Ellen!

1695
01:24:06,208 --> 01:24:08,210
He jumped out.

1696
01:24:08,418 --> 01:24:10,379
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
I'm sorry. I'm sorry.

1697
01:24:10,587 --> 01:24:11,630
I'm sorry.

1698
01:24:17,094 --> 01:24:18,554
Kaminski? Is that you?

1699
01:24:20,847 --> 01:24:22,558
Spencer!

1700
01:24:26,186 --> 01:24:27,646
Get in.

1701
01:24:30,440 --> 01:24:31,900
Thanks, man.

1702
01:24:32,109 --> 01:24:33,610
So Laurie did tell my Mom,

1703
01:24:33,819 --> 01:24:35,487
an d... holy shit.

1704
01:24:37,656 --> 01:24:39,992
Listen, Jo, uh...

1705
01:24:40,200 --> 01:24:42,244
I was just about
to stop by the house,

1706
01:24:42,452 --> 01:24:44,496
but then I, uh...

1707
01:24:45,747 --> 01:24:47,916
I've got hot hands.

1708
01:24:49,293 --> 01:24:51,211
Did you get punched
more than once?

1709
01:24:53,171 --> 01:24:55,048
Yeah, two times.

1710
01:25:05,851 --> 01:25:07,644
Hey, wha...
When's your train again?

1711
01:25:20,782 --> 01:25:23,452
Amber. Amber.

1712
01:25:23,660 --> 01:25:24,661
Amber.

1713
01:25:26,997 --> 01:25:29,333
Um, Jay? What are you doing?

1714
01:25:29,541 --> 01:25:30,375
Uh, it's Mr. Feldman.

1715
01:25:30,584 --> 01:25:31,627
Okay?
And I'm just...

1716
01:25:31,835 --> 01:25:33,462
Wanted...
Just wanted to let you know

1717
01:25:33,670 --> 01:25:36,173
that because you haven't done
any of the work for my class,

1718
01:25:36,381 --> 01:25:38,216
you are... actually, yeah,
you're gonna be failing it.

1719
01:25:38,425 --> 01:25:39,676
You don't take it seriously.

1720
01:25:39,885 --> 01:25:41,261
You have to suffer
the consequences.

1721
01:25:41,470 --> 01:25:43,764
I mean, you don't do the work,
you don't show up.

1722
01:25:43,972 --> 01:25:45,349
You broke two cameras, okay?

1723
01:25:45,557 --> 01:25:46,642
And those are expensive cameras,

1724
01:25:46,850 --> 01:25:48,602
very expensive,
and you broke two.

1725
01:25:48,810 --> 01:25:50,395
No one's ever broken two
but you.

1726
01:25:50,604 --> 01:25:52,064
Okay? So you know what?

1727
01:25:52,272 --> 01:25:53,857
You don't deserve
a passing grade.

1728
01:25:54,066 --> 01:25:55,275
You're not going to get one.

1729
01:25:55,484 --> 01:25:56,652
What is your problem?

1730
01:25:56,860 --> 01:25:58,153
Listen, I'm gonna go.

1731
01:25:58,362 --> 01:26:00,280
Have a great practice,
but just to be clear,

1732
01:26:00,489 --> 01:26:02,574
you fail, Amber.
Okay?

1733
01:26:02,783 --> 01:26:05,786
You fail. Okay. Sorry.

1734
01:26:05,994 --> 01:26:07,954
Sorry, coach.

1735
01:26:11,333 --> 01:26:12,959
Fuck you, Amber.

1736
01:26:15,671 --> 01:26:17,964
Now, just... have fun.
I don't know.

1737
01:26:19,716 --> 01:26:21,510
But not less fun.

1738
01:26:22,386 --> 01:26:23,470
That's great.

1739
01:26:23,679 --> 01:26:25,472
Okay, just relax
your shoulders a little.

1740
01:26:25,681 --> 01:26:27,307
Okay. And just chin up
a tiny bit.

1741
01:26:27,516 --> 01:26:28,850
Too much. Back.

1742
01:26:29,059 --> 01:26:32,104
You're smiling kind of like...
Like weird.

1743
01:26:32,312 --> 01:26:34,106
Spencer, do the... thing.

1744
01:26:34,314 --> 01:26:35,857
Um, seriously? No.
Yeah, I mean, just...

1745
01:26:36,066 --> 01:26:38,151
You know, we'll try it
and then you have it.

1746
01:26:38,360 --> 01:26:40,028
All right, all right.

1747
01:26:40,237 --> 01:26:41,988
Okay, ready?

1748
01:26:44,866 --> 01:26:46,660
Still... you still got it.

1749
01:26:49,246 --> 01:26:50,330
Okay, you wanna see?

1750
01:26:50,539 --> 01:26:52,374
Yeah, let's see.

1751
01:26:52,582 --> 01:26:56,378
We could probably fix your eye
a little bit on the computer.

1752
01:26:56,586 --> 01:26:57,546
No, no, this is perfect.

1753
01:26:57,754 --> 01:26:58,755
Yeah?

1754
01:26:58,964 --> 01:27:00,674
All right, let's do a few more.

1755
01:27:01,758 --> 01:27:03,677
Just look right at me.

1756
01:27:03,885 --> 01:27:05,011
Okay, ready?

1757
01:27:05,220 --> 01:27:07,055
Smiling.

1758
01:27:12,686 --> 01:27:14,146
I'll go get you a ticket,
Spencer,

1759
01:27:14,354 --> 01:27:15,689
'cause the machine's
really different now.

1760
01:27:15,897 --> 01:27:17,524
Thanks, man.

1761
01:27:19,901 --> 01:27:22,571
Listen, Jo. I was thinking
in the car, and I just...

1762
01:27:22,779 --> 01:27:25,991
If you could just tell Mom that I'm
sorry and that I just really need...

1763
01:27:26,199 --> 01:27:31,538
Spencer, is this you trying to fix this in
the six minutes before your train comes?

1764
01:27:31,747 --> 01:27:34,541
Yeah. I just...

1765
01:27:34,750 --> 01:27:38,086
No. I'm sorry.

1766
01:27:39,504 --> 01:27:41,882
So what's this dog Walker thing?

1767
01:27:42,090 --> 01:27:43,925
"Dog walkers" pilot?

1768
01:27:44,134 --> 01:27:46,052
It's so stupid.
It doesn't even matter.

1769
01:27:46,261 --> 01:27:48,555
If it matters to you, I'm not
gonna think it's stupid.

1770
01:27:48,764 --> 01:27:51,391
I... I probably won't think
it's stupid.

1771
01:27:53,518 --> 01:27:56,354
You should call me and let me
know how it goes either way.

1772
01:27:56,563 --> 01:27:59,232
Call me. Okay?
I will.

1773
01:27:59,441 --> 01:28:01,318
But I am not talking to Mom
for you.

1774
01:28:01,526 --> 01:28:02,527
Do you realize
how insane that is?

1775
01:28:02,736 --> 01:28:03,904
All right, I get it,

1776
01:28:04,112 --> 01:28:05,572
and that's... I'm sorry.
All right, well you...

1777
01:28:05,781 --> 01:28:07,032
Great, you will call her?
I'm gonna call her.

1778
01:28:07,240 --> 01:28:08,575
And you will have
a conversation?

1779
01:28:08,784 --> 01:28:10,243
I promise I will call her
and have a conversation.

1780
01:28:10,452 --> 01:28:11,495
Okay?
All right.

1781
01:28:11,703 --> 01:28:12,996
I'm sorry.

1782
01:28:13,205 --> 01:28:14,456
I pro... I will.

1783
01:28:14,664 --> 01:28:16,291
All right.
Okay. Good-bye.

1784
01:28:16,500 --> 01:28:18,835
Hey, guys.

1785
01:28:19,044 --> 01:28:21,379
I got it.

1786
01:28:21,588 --> 01:28:23,006
Bye.
Bye.

1787
01:28:28,929 --> 01:28:30,597
So how you feel?

1788
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:31,848
I feel good. You know?

1789
01:28:32,057 --> 01:28:34,643
Yeah? You feel healthy or...

1790
01:28:34,851 --> 01:28:37,020
At this moment,
I pretty much feel healthy.

1791
01:28:37,229 --> 01:28:38,522
That's good.

1792
01:28:38,730 --> 01:28:40,482
It's a good thing, right?

1793
01:28:40,690 --> 01:28:42,067
Okay, well, I should...
I should go.

1794
01:28:42,275 --> 01:28:43,652
Well, thanks again, man.

1795
01:28:43,860 --> 01:28:44,861
Sure. Yeah.

1796
01:28:45,070 --> 01:28:46,279
Good to see you.
Yeah.

1797
01:28:53,286 --> 01:28:54,496
Look, Jay.

1798
01:28:54,704 --> 01:28:56,206
I'm sorry I said
you can't drive.

1799
01:28:56,414 --> 01:29:00,043
You're a great driver.
You're the best driver I know.

1800
01:29:00,252 --> 01:29:01,878
Okay. Thanks.

1801
01:29:04,464 --> 01:29:05,715
See you soon.

1802
01:30:04,065 --> 01:30:05,400
How's it going, man?

1803
01:30:05,609 --> 01:30:07,819
And you put
some new shoes on my feet

1804
01:30:14,659 --> 01:30:17,913
I know, man.

1805
01:30:18,121 --> 01:30:19,539
I know.
