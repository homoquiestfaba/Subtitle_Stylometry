00:28:26,238 --> 00:28:27,573
What are you doing?

370
00:28:27,673 --> 00:28:29,675
I'm thinking!

371
00:28:29,776 --> 00:28:31,811
Otto, you took my
handmaid and I need

372
00:28:31,911 --> 00:28:32,945
Somebody else to play with.

373
00:28:35,247 --> 00:28:35,948
Dorian!

374
00:28:41,788 --> 00:28:44,490
So, darling, can you tell me
what my dear brother has been

375
00:28:44,590 --> 00:28:46,325
Up to while I've been asleep.

376
00:28:46,425 --> 00:28:50,029
Well, he made a monster, and
it played mommy bounce with me,

377
00:28:50,129 --> 00:28:53,900
And then it's thing
fell off, and it died.

378
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,234
Oh, poor baby.

379
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,336
But the Count blamed me.

380
00:28:57,436 --> 00:28:59,806
And he beat me with a stick.

381
00:28:59,906 --> 00:29:01,140
But that's not the worst of it.

382
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:04,476
He's been flesh worshipping,
and playing with cheerleaders,

383
00:29:04,576 --> 00:29:08,047
And he squandered
the family fortune.

384
00:29:08,147 --> 00:29:10,016
The Doctor's been
chasing the Count,

385
00:29:10,116 --> 00:29:11,517
And destroyed the
Count's coffin,

386
00:29:11,617 --> 00:29:12,718
And now he can't be resurrected.

387
00:29:12,819 --> 00:29:16,255
Now... now he must go back
into the mirror world.

388
00:29:16,355 --> 00:29:18,224
Interesting.

389
00:29:18,324 --> 00:29:24,396
But I must say, your
flesh is very soft.

390
00:29:24,496 --> 00:29:25,431
And your legs!

391
00:29:25,531 --> 00:29:29,435
Your legs are like
highways to heaven.

392
00:29:29,535 --> 00:29:32,704

394
00:29:35,574 --> 00:29:38,677

Let Dorian in!

396
00:29:43,182 --> 00:29:47,519
Is it clockwise,
or anti-clockwise?

397
00:29:47,619 --> 00:29:48,988
Hmmm.

398
00:29:49,088 --> 00:29:50,857
DORIAN: No, Countess!

399
00:29:50,957 --> 00:29:53,259
I'm sorry, Countess.

400
00:29:53,359 --> 00:29:57,096
I didn't mean to touch
your stick stuff.

401
00:29:57,196 --> 00:30:00,232
You mean my cunt.

416
00:30:44,276 --> 00:30:47,479
The professor won't
be long, Doctor.

417
00:30:47,579 --> 00:30:48,780
Good.

418
00:30:48,881 --> 00:30:55,087
I had a patient,
a man in wheels.

00:30:55,187 --> 00:30:56,088

stinky little doctor.

No.

426
00:31:16,008 --> 00:31:18,344
When I was in medical
school with the professor,

427

of all of Hamburg.

00:31:26,818 --> 00:31:29,388

433
00:31:33,592 --> 00:31:37,964
Indeed, but only from a
mental standpoint, of course.

434
00:31:38,064 --> 00:31:40,599
Lovely blanket you
have there, Doctor.

435
00:31:40,699 --> 00:31:44,136
My mother knitted this blanket.

436
00:31:44,236 --> 00:31:49,508
She knitted it from the wool
from my pet lamb, Herman.

438
00:31:50,809 --> 00:31:55,014

little Herman, Doctor?

439
00:31:55,114 --> 00:31:57,216
Well, very sad.

440
00:31:57,316 --> 00:31:59,685
Herman... we had to eat
Herman for Christmas.

441
00:31:59,785 --> 00:32:04,823
We were very poor,
my mother and I.

442

Did you eat even the organs?

443

Uh, yes!

466
00:33:17,596 --> 00:33:18,730
Oh, of course.

00:33:20,032 --> 00:33:21,167
I was... you were there?

00:33:21,267 --> 00:33:22,468
Yes, of course.
Of course.

In the early... in the early
days of the great experiment.

Had let us, Herr Professor.

to our intelligence.

the syphilis to the phallus.

the brain in the penis.

continued with my experiments.

00:46:45,136 --> 00:46:49,074
Yes, yes, you filthy boy!

738
00:46:49,174 --> 00:46:50,842
[Seal sounds]

739
00:46:53,845 --> 00:46:59,050
And don't let me catch
you idiots doing it again!

740
00:46:59,150 --> 00:47:00,251
Oh, Master.

741
00:47:03,188 --> 00:47:05,123
Baby wants to play with
those toilet titties!

742
00:47:08,059 --> 00:47:09,760
Where are you talking the tray?

743
00:47:09,861 --> 00:47:13,298
Um, I'm talking it to your
younger sister, Bloodvena.

744
00:47:13,398 --> 00:47:15,300
She's awake.

745
00:47:15,400 --> 00:47:16,301
Bloodvena's awake?

746
00:47:16,401 --> 00:47:17,435
Yes, Master.

747
00:47:17,535 --> 00:47:20,305
I was just taking her
this light refreshment.

748
00:47:20,405 --> 00:47:24,809
Why don't you rest your
pretty, little, stinky feet.

749
00:47:24,910 --> 00:47:27,312
Let me take this to Bloodvena.

750
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,117
Goodbye.

751
00:47:32,217 --> 00:47:33,084
Yes, Master.

752
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:52,803
[Music playing]

753
00:47:52,904 --> 00:47:58,476
So, Bloodvena, my dear, do you
like the tea Otto made for you?

754
00:47:58,576 --> 00:48:04,815
Yes, Otto, but I see
danger in the tea leaves.

755
00:48:04,916 --> 00:48:05,750
Yes, Bloodvena.

756
00:48:05,850 --> 00:48:07,618
You were always
the most beautiful

757
00:48:07,718 --> 00:48:09,587
And the most intelligent.

758
00:48:09,687 --> 00:48:12,557
You are right.

759
00:48:12,657 --> 00:48:14,993
There is danger.

760
00:48:15,093 --> 00:48:19,897
But anyway, how have you been
keeping yourself, my dear?

761
00:48:19,998 --> 00:48:24,635
Oh, you know,
terrorizing orphans,

762
00:48:24,735 --> 00:48:28,906
Looking for virgins, the usual.

763
00:48:29,007 --> 00:48:31,009
But I'm bored, Otto.

764
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:34,079
When can we go back
to the mirror world?

765
00:48:34,179 --> 00:48:38,216
Unless we get the
crest from the doctor,

766
00:48:38,316 --> 00:48:42,653
We shall never see the
mirror world again?

767
00:48:42,753 --> 00:48:45,023
The doctor?

768
00:48:45,123 --> 00:48:50,095
Is that the funny little
man in the wheelchair?

769
00:48:50,195 --> 00:48:55,233
I don't think it will be very
difficult to get rid of him.

770
00:48:55,333 --> 00:49:00,438
Ah, so you know
the doctor, my dear?

771
00:49:00,538 --> 00:49:04,842
Well, that's only
half our troubles.

772
00:49:04,942 --> 00:49:08,246
That bitch sister
of ours is awake

773
00:49:08,346 --> 00:49:12,617
And she's trying to
claim half the castle.

774
00:49:12,717 --> 00:49:18,389
But she can't do that,
Otto, because I own a third.

775
00:49:18,489 --> 00:49:21,359
Oh, that's right.

776
00:49:21,459 --> 00:49:24,362
I forgot.

777
00:49:24,462 --> 00:49:27,432
I'll take care
of the doctor, you

778
00:49:27,532 --> 00:49:31,702
Take care of that old bitch.

779
00:49:31,802 --> 00:49:34,672
Together, Otto.

780
00:49:34,772 --> 00:49:38,643

Who's the star?

785
00:49:55,160 --> 00:49:57,795
You are the star, my Count.

786
00:49:57,895 --> 00:49:58,829

(SINGING) How I
wonder where you are...

788
00:50:03,068 --> 00:50:06,137
It's not where you are,
it's what you are, you idiot!

789
00:50:06,237 --> 00:50:07,838
I'm sorry, my Count.

790

What do you want?

794
00:50:15,546 --> 00:50:17,282
Does this belong to you?

[Panting]

796
00:50:23,388 --> 00:50:24,089
No!

797
00:50:24,189 --> 00:50:25,256
It doesn't belong to me.

798
00:50:25,356 --> 00:50:27,925
Now get it out of here,
you filthy, dirty thing!

799
00:50:30,728 --> 00:50:32,330
Smells like mommy's pissy tits.

Go!

809
00:50:59,957 --> 00:51:00,658
I'm mature.

810
00:51:05,196 --> 00:51:08,799
You call that mature?

811
00:51:08,899 --> 00:51:09,767
Mmm.

00:51:09,867 --> 00:51:13,738

818
00:51:52,843 --> 00:51:55,180
Who is it, Herr Doctor?

819
00:51:55,280 --> 00:51:57,615
It is the youngest of
the Count's sisters.

820
00:51:57,715 --> 00:52:01,118
Be careful, Mr. Hansome, she
has the power of hypnosis.

will fall into her spell!

should be doing this?

Of course, we should!

Besides, I have a
little present for you.

trouble turning into a bat?

I don't need Flyagra tablets!

I can turn into a
bat any time I like.

I can turn into a
bat six times in one

Oh, Otto, darling,
you're looking so weak.

maybe watched a little?

you make the food, huh?

thing up my... my butt pocket.

What are we talking about?

get a bite to eat.

Yes, my dear.

Yes, Master?

Meet me upstairs
in five minutes.

These are the ruins of the
Counts old castle, Mr. Hansome.

898
00:58:17,194 --> 00:58:19,830
What happened to
it, Herr Doctor?

899
00:58:19,930 --> 00:58:23,968
It was five years ago
today, I followed him here,

900
00:58:24,068 --> 00:58:26,804
To his castle full of freaks.

901
00:58:26,904 --> 00:58:28,706
And with a wave
of his hand, he of

902
00:58:28,806 --> 00:58:35,345
Destroyed the whole place, like
a temperamental child kicking

903
00:58:35,445 --> 00:58:37,081
Over his building blocks.

904
00:58:40,417 --> 00:58:41,986
But fear not, Mr. Hansome.

905

He does not possess
these Same powers.

906
00:58:45,522 --> 00:58:48,525
He has been too long
without his crest.

907

Mmm.

908
00:58:50,027 --> 00:58:54,031
I, too, once had building
blocks, Herr Doctor.

00:58:56,333 --> 00:58:57,935
MR. HANSOME: Who are
they, Herr Doctor?

912
00:58:58,035 --> 00:59:01,505
They are the sisters of
sorrow from the mirror world!

913
00:59:01,606 --> 00:59:04,909
But Doctor, how can they
survive the sunlight?

914
00:59:05,009 --> 00:59:06,176
Ah!

915
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:10,380
They are merely an
illusion, a reflection

916
00:59:10,480 --> 00:59:14,451

Here is your virgin.

1100
01:14:09,045 --> 01:14:12,015
A mommy's boy virgin,
are you, Doctor?

1101
01:14:12,115 --> 01:14:12,816
Never mind.

1102
01:14:15,619 --> 01:14:18,221
I just booked myself a ticket
back to the mirror world.

1103
01:14:40,043 --> 01:14:40,744
Passenger!

1104
