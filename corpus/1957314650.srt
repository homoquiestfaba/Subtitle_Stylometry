00:10:32,032 --> 00:10:33,431
(GIGGLING)

177
00:10:36,503 --> 00:10:37,568
Hmm.

178
00:10:37,637 --> 00:10:39,103
(GRUNTS)

179
00:10:49,816 --> 00:10:51,516
Hmm...

180
00:10:51,584 --> 00:10:54,619
Looks like somebody's
ready to come over to Daddy.

181
00:10:56,689 --> 00:10:58,556
It's just you and me.

182
00:10:58,625 --> 00:11:00,892
Got any ideas about
what we could be doing?

183
00:11:00,961 --> 00:11:02,560
I'm getting one.

184
00:11:05,932 --> 00:11:09,167
MARK: Mommy and
Daddy sitting in the tree,

185
00:11:09,235 --> 00:11:12,370
K-I-S-S-I-N-G.

186
00:11:12,439 --> 00:11:15,206
RANDY: We're
in the tree, stupid.

187
00:11:17,643 --> 00:11:19,410
(WHISTLES)

188
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:22,291
Are you looking good. Let me
get out of these cruddy clothes.

189
00:11:22,315 --> 00:11:24,048
Don't take too long.

190
00:11:24,117 --> 00:11:26,384
I won't.

191
00:11:26,452 --> 00:11:28,786
What a great night
with the boys, though.

192
00:11:28,855 --> 00:11:30,588
Lot of good food. Oh.

193
00:11:32,325 --> 00:11:33,892
(SIGHING)

194
00:11:35,896 --> 00:11:39,497
I got some double-cheese
nachos sitting right here.

195
00:11:40,633 --> 00:11:42,233
(BURPING) Oh.

196
00:11:44,971 --> 00:11:46,103
Tim.

197
00:11:46,172 --> 00:11:47,783
Little gas bubble.
Moving, moving...

198
00:11:47,807 --> 00:11:48,807
(BURPS)

199
00:11:52,746 --> 00:11:54,612
This is real attractive.

200
00:11:56,950 --> 00:11:59,884
So where were we?

201
00:12:04,424 --> 00:12:07,692
It's kind of hard to remember.

202
00:12:07,761 --> 00:12:09,827
This will refresh your memory.

203
00:12:10,530 --> 00:12:11,763
(BURPS)

204
00:12:16,770 --> 00:12:17,969
Sorry.

205
00:12:22,141 --> 00:12:25,577
Sorry. I'm sorry.
Mark was right. Ugh.

206
00:12:25,645 --> 00:12:29,125
You shouldn't have double
onions on those chili dogs.

207
00:12:30,450 --> 00:12:31,683
Hello.

208
00:12:39,092 --> 00:12:41,692

little hand in mine

(MUSIC STOPS)

214
00:13:06,619 --> 00:13:12,156
The Minimag 100 is perfect
for picking up screws and nails.

215
00:13:12,225 --> 00:13:14,736
It can also pick up small tools
that have carelessly been dropped

216
00:13:14,760 --> 00:13:18,080
behind the workbench,
perhaps the fault of a co-worker.

217
00:13:21,368 --> 00:13:24,635
And the Minimag 2000.

218
00:13:24,704 --> 00:13:29,207
Small, but powerful. 10
pounds will pick up 400 pounds.

219
00:13:29,275 --> 00:13:31,609
This would suck The Tin
Man right through a keyhole.

220
00:13:33,212 --> 00:13:35,524
Well, it was designed
to pick up sheet metal,

221
00:13:35,548 --> 00:13:38,249
so you wanna keep
it pointed to... Tim.

222
00:13:40,987 --> 00:13:44,422
No, no, just slide
it straight down!

223
00:13:47,694 --> 00:13:48,694
Tim.

224
00:13:52,732 --> 00:13:55,266
Pretty powerful
little thing, isn't it?

225
00:14:00,940 --> 00:14:03,074
Marv, hold it back. Marv!

226
00:14:10,049 --> 00:14:11,260
I just love this set. Yeah.

227
00:14:11,284 --> 00:14:12,928
There's so many
memories on this set.

228
00:14:12,952 --> 00:14:16,053
Mario Andretti stood right here
and gave us a bunch of grief.

229
00:14:16,122 --> 00:14:17,621
And then, one of the astronauts,

230
00:14:17,690 --> 00:14:19,123
Ken Bowersocks, and all his team

231
00:14:19,192 --> 00:14:20,669
were standing right
there. Remember that?

232
00:14:20,693 --> 00:14:21,759
Yeah.

233
00:14:21,828 --> 00:14:25,396
And then you insulted
my mother, right there.

234
00:14:25,464 --> 00:14:29,066
And then you insulted
my mother over there.

235
00:14:29,135 --> 00:14:32,303
'Course, you insulted
my mother back there, too.

236
00:14:32,371 --> 00:14:34,316
Just about everywhere,
you insulted my mother.

237
00:14:34,340 --> 00:14:36,407
Richard, Richard,
Richard. Hold on a second.

238
00:14:36,475 --> 00:14:40,111
Focus on me right now.
It was a television show.

239
00:14:41,314 --> 00:14:43,648
Wasn't your real mother.

240
00:14:44,684 --> 00:14:46,784
I loved my pretend mother.

241
00:14:48,554 --> 00:14:51,555
Let's all pretend
that he didn't say that.

242
00:14:52,892 --> 00:14:54,258
Let's pretend to move on.

243
00:14:54,327 --> 00:14:55,971
Okay, I understand,
I understand.

244
00:14:55,995 --> 00:14:58,296
Let's just watch a clip of
the <i>Tool</i> girls, shall we?

245
00:14:58,365 --> 00:15:00,209
MAN: Yeah. WOMAN: Yeah.

246
00:15:00,233 --> 00:15:01,877
Does everybody
know what time it is?

247
00:15:01,901 --> 00:15:03,478
Does everybody
know what time it is?

248
00:15:03,502 --> 00:15:05,203
<i>Tool Time! Tool Time!</i>

249
00:15:05,271 --> 00:15:07,483
That's right! Binford
Tools is proud to present

250
00:15:07,507 --> 00:15:09,574
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

251
00:15:09,642 --> 00:15:10,908
Tim "The Tool Man"...

252
00:15:10,976 --> 00:15:13,044
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor!

253
00:15:31,765 --> 00:15:32,964
Nice dress, Deb.

254
00:15:33,033 --> 00:15:34,265
Thank you.

255
00:15:34,333 --> 00:15:35,611
Do you remember the
first time I wore this?

256
00:15:35,635 --> 00:15:38,603
(STUTTERING) Yeah, at
that hardware convention.

257
00:15:38,671 --> 00:15:40,471
No. No, that was Al.

258
00:15:43,276 --> 00:15:46,322
Here's a little bit of trivia. The first
time I appeared on <i>Home Improvement,</i>

259
00:15:46,346 --> 00:15:48,313
I was not the <i>Tool Time</i> girl.

260
00:15:48,381 --> 00:15:51,915
And it went something
like this. Something like this.

261
00:15:52,885 --> 00:15:55,619
Whoa, baby, bad news.

262
00:15:59,759 --> 00:16:03,560
This is not the night for you
to give up looking at women.

263
00:16:05,565 --> 00:16:08,032
Uh-huh. Oh, why is that, Jill?

264
00:16:08,101 --> 00:16:11,702
Because an unbelievable
young goddess just came in

265
00:16:11,770 --> 00:16:13,783
and sat right behind
you. Yeah, right.

266
00:16:13,807 --> 00:16:15,350
Yes. I'm gonna
fall into that one.

267
00:16:15,374 --> 00:16:17,153
What, a 74-year-old steelworker?

268
00:16:17,177 --> 00:16:19,321
(GRUFFLY) "Hey, Marge,
they got no beer here."

269
00:16:19,345 --> 00:16:21,946
Not exactly, Tim. Oh, yeah,
she's the va-va-voom type?

270
00:16:22,015 --> 00:16:23,815
Well, as a matter of fact,

271
00:16:23,883 --> 00:16:27,918
she has great va-vas
and a darned good voom.

272
00:16:27,987 --> 00:16:29,898
All right with me, because
you're looking pretty good

273
00:16:29,922 --> 00:16:32,601
since you took a couple
of pounds off your voom.

274
00:16:32,625 --> 00:16:35,926
(CHUCKLES) Well, thank you
so much. Now, if you'll excuse me,

275
00:16:35,995 --> 00:16:39,330
I'm going to take my
voom to the ladies' room.

276
00:16:39,399 --> 00:16:42,144
I'll be looking at my
menu and nothing else.

277
00:16:42,168 --> 00:16:45,670
Oh, man. Off to the right,
three o'clock. Unbelievable!

278
00:17:09,595 --> 00:17:11,295
Hey, it is you.

279
00:17:11,364 --> 00:17:15,165
Tim "The Tool Man" Taylor?
I never miss your show.

280
00:17:15,235 --> 00:17:18,447
Oh, you have me confused with
that handsome guy on <i>Tool Time.</i>

281
00:17:18,471 --> 00:17:21,339
Don't be modest. Could
I get your autograph?

282
00:17:21,407 --> 00:17:23,586
Yeah, quick. Why don't you
just slide it right under here,

283
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,343
under my head here? Okay.

284
00:17:25,411 --> 00:17:27,111
Could you make it out to Kiki?

285
00:17:27,179 --> 00:17:28,479
Kiki.

286
00:17:29,014 --> 00:17:30,281
K-I...

287
00:17:30,350 --> 00:17:31,582
Oh...

288
00:17:33,253 --> 00:17:36,387
Okay, Kikster, here you go.

289
00:17:36,456 --> 00:17:38,556
Hmm. Could you put
my last name, too?

290
00:17:38,625 --> 00:17:40,135
Ah, you know, my
wife is due back.

291
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:42,993
She's coming out... Kiki
Van Fursterwallenscheinlaw.

292
00:17:48,667 --> 00:17:50,268
What? F-U-R

293
00:17:50,336 --> 00:17:51,981
S-T-E-R-W-A-L-L. Uh-huh.

294
00:17:52,005 --> 00:17:53,949
I'm getting a hand
cramp. Hold on.

295
00:17:53,973 --> 00:17:58,275
E-N-S-C-H-E-I-N-L-A-W.
Uh-huh. Uh-huh.

296
00:17:58,344 --> 00:18:01,646
L-A-W. Good thing
it didn't run out of ink.

297
00:18:01,714 --> 00:18:03,313
(GIGGLES)

298
00:18:03,382 --> 00:18:05,116
Now can you grunt for me?

299
00:18:05,185 --> 00:18:07,262
Well, you know, my wife
is coming back and I just...

300
00:18:07,286 --> 00:18:08,518
Hello, honey.

301
00:18:08,587 --> 00:18:10,621
(CHOKING) JILL: Excuse me.

302
00:18:13,726 --> 00:18:15,426
(GRUNTING)

303
00:18:18,397 --> 00:18:20,497
(ALL GRUNTING)

304
00:18:23,602 --> 00:18:25,402
What are you doing?

305
00:18:26,772 --> 00:18:28,406
Are you choking?

306
00:18:41,754 --> 00:18:44,866
The reason men check out women
isn't because we lust after them.

307
00:18:44,890 --> 00:18:48,459
We look because it reminds us of
how much better we have it at home.

308
00:18:48,528 --> 00:18:49,727
Right, men?

309
00:18:49,795 --> 00:18:51,028
(MEN CHEERING)

310
00:18:51,097 --> 00:18:52,496
Are they lying, women?

311
00:18:52,565 --> 00:18:53,964
Yes! Yes!

312
00:18:54,032 --> 00:18:56,567
We have a disagreement.

313
00:18:56,636 --> 00:18:59,871
That's because men and
women are different, duh,

314
00:18:59,939 --> 00:19:03,674
much like a dry-cell battery.

315
00:19:03,743 --> 00:19:05,463
The positive side
is free-flowing,

316
00:19:05,512 --> 00:19:07,612
full of energy, giving
life everywhere,

317
00:19:07,680 --> 00:19:10,781
but the negative side just sucks
all the energy out of every situation.

318
00:19:10,850 --> 00:19:12,050
Negative, negative, negative.

319
00:19:12,118 --> 00:19:13,918
You never do any
work around here.

320
00:19:13,987 --> 00:19:16,053
You're always
leaving the seat up.

321
00:19:18,024 --> 00:19:20,424
Well, you decide
which end is which.

322
00:19:22,862 --> 00:19:24,995
Why don't we watch another clip?

323
00:19:25,064 --> 00:19:26,997
Tim, I don't wanna
be a nagging wife.

324
00:19:27,066 --> 00:19:29,767
Then how will I recognize you?

325
00:19:29,836 --> 00:19:32,302
Got to be something in
here you can get rid of.

326
00:19:32,371 --> 00:19:37,007
Yeah, but I stayed married
to it because of the kids.

327
00:19:37,076 --> 00:19:38,887
Why do you always bug
me during the football game?

328
00:19:38,911 --> 00:19:42,246
Did I bug you during childbirth?

329
00:19:42,315 --> 00:19:45,983
No, but you bugged
me during conception.

330
00:19:46,051 --> 00:19:47,562
You never told me
about a job interview.

331
00:19:47,586 --> 00:19:49,331
Tim, do you ever listen to me?

332
00:19:49,355 --> 00:19:51,566
It was the last thing that I
said in bed to you last night.

333
00:19:51,590 --> 00:19:53,969
No, I believe, if you recall,
the last thing you said to me

334
00:19:53,993 --> 00:19:55,326
in bed last night was,

335
00:19:55,395 --> 00:19:56,395
"No!"

336
00:20:03,336 --> 00:20:05,369
You're thinking of tonight.

337
00:20:10,809 --> 00:20:12,988
If your husband was
something you find in the kitchen,

338
00:20:13,012 --> 00:20:16,147
what would he be? Oh,
that's deep. Yeah, that's deep.

339
00:20:16,215 --> 00:20:18,916
I think you'll find this
very insightful, Tim.

340
00:20:18,985 --> 00:20:22,319
"A," an oven, warm and
self-cleaning. Not me.

341
00:20:22,388 --> 00:20:27,325
"B," garbage disposal,
grating and eats anything.

342
00:20:27,393 --> 00:20:30,828
"C," a refrigerator. Very
cold and the light's never on.

343
00:20:34,333 --> 00:20:36,300
These are stupid.

344
00:20:36,369 --> 00:20:37,868
Well, come on.

345
00:20:37,937 --> 00:20:38,802
You haven't read the
one that I picked for you.

346
00:20:38,871 --> 00:20:40,337
Read "D."

347
00:20:40,406 --> 00:20:42,639
"D," a tea kettle.

348
00:20:42,708 --> 00:20:45,209
Hot and steamy,
done in two minutes.

349
00:20:50,516 --> 00:20:54,719
Do I ever wish that I
married somebody else?

350
00:20:57,223 --> 00:20:59,623
Why would I wanna
marry anybody else?

351
00:21:01,060 --> 00:21:04,561
You're funny. You're sexy.

352
00:21:04,631 --> 00:21:08,933
Creative, you take chances and
you're definitely not afraid to be wrong.

353
00:21:15,174 --> 00:21:17,519
I'm perfectly happy being
married to a man who thinks

354
00:21:17,543 --> 00:21:20,745
that PBS is something that
women get once a month.

355
00:21:25,818 --> 00:21:27,451
Quit that.

356
00:21:27,520 --> 00:21:30,833
No, really, stick your nose right there
and tell me I don't smell like a man.

357
00:21:30,857 --> 00:21:32,634
(CHUCKLES) Yeah, Cro-Magnon man.

358
00:21:32,658 --> 00:21:34,024
(GRUNTING)

359
00:21:34,093 --> 00:21:36,993
I believe he was
never fully erect, either.

360
00:21:37,863 --> 00:21:39,830
(GRUNTING)

361
00:21:39,899 --> 00:21:42,311
We never actually said that we
weren't gonna have another baby.

362
00:21:42,335 --> 00:21:45,002
I've said it. I've talked about
it. I know I've talked about it.

363
00:21:45,071 --> 00:21:46,937
I mentioned it on <i>Tool Time.</i>

364
00:21:47,006 --> 00:21:50,366
Oh, great. So 11
people know about it?

365
00:21:51,344 --> 00:21:53,978
Remember babies
at all? Dirty diapers.

366
00:21:54,046 --> 00:21:57,514
Colic, 2:00 am feedings,
3:00 am feedings!

367
00:21:57,583 --> 00:21:59,716
I don't have the
energy for that anymore.

368
00:21:59,785 --> 00:22:01,129
You don't have
the energy to say,

369
00:22:01,153 --> 00:22:03,434
"Wake up, Jill, the
baby wants you"?

370
00:22:08,528 --> 00:22:10,428
I just read this survey,

371
00:22:10,496 --> 00:22:13,264
and it said that some couples,
no matter how busy they are,

372
00:22:13,332 --> 00:22:16,266
still make love
five times a week.

373
00:22:16,335 --> 00:22:17,935
With each other?

374
00:22:20,072 --> 00:22:21,072
Yeah.

375
00:22:24,543 --> 00:22:25,663
Hi.

376
00:22:26,979 --> 00:22:28,745
Hi.

377
00:22:28,815 --> 00:22:30,259
Come down here, I want
to show you something.

378
00:22:30,283 --> 00:22:31,348
What?

379
00:22:31,417 --> 00:22:32,749
Come here.

380
00:22:36,722 --> 00:22:38,289
I made a scale model

381
00:22:38,357 --> 00:22:41,425
of the office I'll build you when
you become a psychologist.

382
00:22:41,493 --> 00:22:44,973
Here's your desk, here's
your chair and here's your nut.

383
00:22:53,539 --> 00:22:54,705
Where am I?

384
00:22:54,774 --> 00:22:56,014
Seated at the desk.

385
00:22:56,676 --> 00:22:58,509
And why did you do this?

386
00:22:58,577 --> 00:23:00,122
I thought it would cheer you up,

387
00:23:00,146 --> 00:23:01,323
because I think you
might have the blues

388
00:23:01,347 --> 00:23:03,313
and maybe we
should talk about it.

389
00:23:03,382 --> 00:23:04,815
So you're saying you wanna talk.

390
00:23:04,884 --> 00:23:07,284
Why do you think
I'm laying down?

391
00:23:09,789 --> 00:23:12,701
You know, the other day, when
you asked me what I was feeling,

392
00:23:12,725 --> 00:23:16,245
I told you, and you
jumped down my throat.

393
00:23:20,365 --> 00:23:23,067
You're right. It wasn't fair.

394
00:23:23,135 --> 00:23:25,569
If I'm going to ask
for your feelings,

395
00:23:25,637 --> 00:23:28,906
then I should be able to accept
them, no matter what they are.

396
00:23:28,974 --> 00:23:32,574
And not hit me on the
head with a croquet ball.

397
00:23:34,213 --> 00:23:35,378
Sorry about that.

398
00:23:35,447 --> 00:23:36,447
(KISSES)

399
00:23:38,617 --> 00:23:41,657
Not sure you should kiss your
patients on that part of the peanut.

400
00:23:52,832 --> 00:23:54,042
Absolutely free!

401
00:23:54,066 --> 00:23:55,632
Oh, did you say free?

402
00:23:57,469 --> 00:24:00,437
"No, it's me, I'm
Spartacus." "I am Spartacus."

403
00:24:00,505 --> 00:24:04,341
(LISPING) "No, it's me. I'm Spartacus.
Really, I'm Spartacus. Ask anybody."

404
00:24:07,079 --> 00:24:08,212
Clap.

405
00:24:08,280 --> 00:24:09,440
Uh...

406
00:24:11,016 --> 00:24:12,182
(HUMMING)

407
00:24:15,654 --> 00:24:16,820
Yes!

408
00:24:21,860 --> 00:24:23,827
And now, you just...

409
00:24:34,139 --> 00:24:37,474
I am a sick, sick man.

410
00:24:43,883 --> 00:24:45,983
In the eight years
I did the show,

411
00:24:46,051 --> 00:24:49,052
there was only two times,
seriously, that I was ever scared.

412
00:24:49,121 --> 00:24:50,621
And the first time...

413
00:24:50,690 --> 00:24:52,868
Well, I'm going to tell
you, I have a Telestrator,

414
00:24:52,892 --> 00:24:54,703
one of those things that
Madden used. So you gotta watch,

415
00:24:54,727 --> 00:24:56,772
because this could be kind of
fun to use. I've never done this.

416
00:24:56,796 --> 00:24:59,107
The first time that I was
scared on <i>Home Improvement</i>

417
00:24:59,131 --> 00:25:01,665
in these eight years
went something like this.

418
00:25:01,734 --> 00:25:03,267
Watch carefully.

419
00:25:03,336 --> 00:25:04,735
I never knew how to drive this.

420
00:25:07,105 --> 00:25:08,772
Watch the front wheels.

421
00:25:09,875 --> 00:25:11,708
Right here. Not good!

422
00:25:12,879 --> 00:25:14,244
No, no.

423
00:25:15,815 --> 00:25:17,280
Stop it. Stop, stop.

424
00:25:20,185 --> 00:25:21,919
All right.

425
00:25:21,987 --> 00:25:26,089
They didn't even ask me if I had
ever driven one of these things before.

426
00:25:26,158 --> 00:25:29,426
Let me point out a few
John Madden-type things.

427
00:25:29,494 --> 00:25:31,828
These are the distances
you should be very aware of.

428
00:25:31,897 --> 00:25:34,197
Here and here.

429
00:25:34,266 --> 00:25:36,466
Right there. See that?

430
00:25:36,535 --> 00:25:39,303
See that little distance here?

431
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,172
That's how far the
wheel is off the ground.

432
00:25:43,042 --> 00:25:44,641
That's a no-no.

433
00:25:45,777 --> 00:25:48,078
See this, here?
That's the bucket.

434
00:25:48,147 --> 00:25:52,449
Up here, above my
head. Another no-no.

435
00:25:52,517 --> 00:25:57,087
But the real telling part of this
scared, a butt-clenching scared...

436
00:25:59,792 --> 00:26:03,126
Right there are the two
joysticks that control the vehicle.

437
00:26:04,930 --> 00:26:06,764
(LAUGHING)

438
00:26:06,832 --> 00:26:09,733
And here...

439
00:26:13,673 --> 00:26:18,275
Yup, those are my hands.

440
00:26:18,344 --> 00:26:23,847
And that is a man
driving a car like this.

441
00:26:23,916 --> 00:26:25,782
(SCREAMING)

442
00:26:29,521 --> 00:26:30,654
All right.

443
00:26:32,558 --> 00:26:34,992
Too funny. Now,

444
00:26:35,061 --> 00:26:38,528
the second-scariest
moment is this next clip,

445
00:26:38,598 --> 00:26:42,666
where it's more of an emotional
scary. It really was scary for me.

446
00:26:42,735 --> 00:26:45,469
We had had a romantic
evening in the script planned,

447
00:26:45,537 --> 00:26:48,438
and she didn't tell
me, right, Case?

448
00:26:48,507 --> 00:26:51,808
Yeah, I remember that. That was
the night you came down to the bar

449
00:26:51,877 --> 00:26:54,489
with me and the fellows after
work and had a couple drinks.

450
00:26:54,513 --> 00:26:56,847
Right. But when I got home...

451
00:26:56,915 --> 00:27:01,651
Well, it went something
like this. <i>Something like this.</i>

452
00:27:01,720 --> 00:27:05,522
I spent two days
planning this evening.

453
00:27:05,590 --> 00:27:07,702
Do you have any
idea how long it's been

454
00:27:07,726 --> 00:27:10,894
since we had a quiet,
romantic evening together?

455
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:12,674
I was on the phone. Why
didn't you say, "Come home"?

456
00:27:12,698 --> 00:27:14,464
I wanted to surprise you.

457
00:27:14,533 --> 00:27:16,300
Well, I'm surprised.

458
00:27:17,770 --> 00:27:19,235
Come on, Jill, lighten up.

459
00:27:19,305 --> 00:27:21,416
I didn't understand what
you meant on the phone.

460
00:27:21,440 --> 00:27:23,385
Well, what did you think I meant
when I said all that stuff about

461
00:27:23,409 --> 00:27:27,578
how I was looking forward to
seeing you and, "I'll be waiting"?

462
00:27:27,647 --> 00:27:31,281
Oh, like you said it
like that, "I'll be waiting."

463
00:27:31,350 --> 00:27:34,818
Well, I wanted to be more subtle.
What did you want me to say?

464
00:27:34,886 --> 00:27:38,588
"The kids are gone, I'm home
alone, come and take me, Big Daddy"?

465
00:27:41,259 --> 00:27:42,939
Well, that, I understand.

466
00:27:47,666 --> 00:27:49,444
Good night. Come on, Jill.

467
00:27:49,468 --> 00:27:52,180
I don't go out with these guys every
night. What's making you so angry?

468
00:27:52,204 --> 00:27:54,916
I am angry because you said you
were going to be home in 15 minutes

469
00:27:54,940 --> 00:27:56,774
and then you weren't.

470
00:27:56,842 --> 00:27:59,320
Because I'm flirting with you like crazy
on the phone, you didn't even notice.

471
00:27:59,344 --> 00:28:02,746
And most of all, because I
went to all this trouble for nothing.

472
00:28:02,815 --> 00:28:04,548
I spent the whole
evening by myself,

473
00:28:04,617 --> 00:28:07,016
and now you're stuck
with a plate of cold food.

474
00:28:07,085 --> 00:28:09,919
Oh, don't worry about
me, I ate at the bar.

475
00:28:12,991 --> 00:28:16,026
Wait, wait, wait, wait.
I didn't have dessert.

476
00:28:17,062 --> 00:28:19,696
All right, stop
it here. All right.

477
00:28:19,765 --> 00:28:22,432
Roll it back here. Stop, stop,
stop. All right, now, right here,

478
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:24,768
she had just said that
and I actually jolted out of...

479
00:28:24,836 --> 00:28:26,202
I was in, like, a trance.

480
00:28:26,272 --> 00:28:28,272
And see this face here?

481
00:28:28,340 --> 00:28:32,643
That just says, "Fear."

482
00:28:32,711 --> 00:28:35,056
It wasn't supposed to be that
way. It was supposed to be just...

483
00:28:35,080 --> 00:28:38,080
The dialog... I knew she was going
to get angry. She got so angry with me,

484
00:28:38,116 --> 00:28:41,618
I came out of character
and stopped the show to go,

485
00:28:41,687 --> 00:28:44,855
"Jeez, Pat, are you all right?"

486
00:28:46,725 --> 00:28:49,526
She walks up to me, gets about
an inch in front of my face, she goes,

487
00:28:49,595 --> 00:28:52,262
"Yes, Tim. That's
called 'Acting.'"

488
00:28:56,368 --> 00:28:58,067
Oh.

489
00:29:04,810 --> 00:29:07,010
Oh.

490
00:29:07,078 --> 00:29:09,918
I sat there, going, "I'm
going to have to try that."

491
00:29:12,918 --> 00:29:15,852
If you parked a brand-new car
under a tree filled with hungry pigeons,

492

Even if you do something as
crazy as park a new car under a tree,

496
00:29:29,301 --> 00:29:30,968
filled with just-fed...

497
00:29:32,971 --> 00:29:34,571
Even if you do
something as crazy

498
00:29:34,639 --> 00:29:38,175
as parking your car under a
tree filled with birds, I am not...

499
00:29:41,280 --> 00:29:42,879
This is jammed or something, Al.

500
00:29:48,954 --> 00:29:52,623
I'll just climb up there and
show you how sturdy this is.

501
00:29:52,691 --> 00:29:55,437

ladder. Just as supportive as...

502
00:29:55,461 --> 00:29:57,105
Tim, you might
wanna watch the...

503
00:29:57,129 --> 00:29:58,428
Could I finish here, Al?

504
00:29:58,497 --> 00:29:59,974
I just want you to be
careful, so you don't...

506
00:30:10,342 --> 00:30:11,841
Thank you all. Look.

00:30:14,646 --> 00:30:17,380
This is it.

508
00:30:17,449 --> 00:30:20,562
This is the garage. This is
the home of the automobile.

509
00:30:20,586 --> 00:30:23,253
It's the piston palace.
And the carburetor castle.

510
00:30:23,322 --> 00:30:27,224
It's that muffler mansion.
The transmission Taj Mahal.

00:30:27,292 --> 00:30:30,627
Casey, give me
some road-rage rock!

512
00:30:30,696 --> 00:30:32,663
You got it, Timmy.

00:30:58,524 --> 00:31:02,158
I've been thinking of checking
into the Henry Ford Clinic.

518
00:31:08,200 --> 00:31:10,933
This is the greatest gift
you've ever given me.

519
00:31:11,002 --> 00:31:13,170
I gave you three children.

520
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:16,072
Yeah, but none of them
came out this clean.

521
00:31:20,512 --> 00:31:24,947
On <i>Home Improvement,</i> I
was a father to three boys.

522
00:31:25,017 --> 00:31:27,683
Of course, I wasn't
their real father.

523
00:31:30,322 --> 00:31:32,600
No, no, no, no, of course
I wasn't their real father.

524
00:31:32,624 --> 00:31:34,102
I was really more like a mentor,

525
00:31:34,126 --> 00:31:38,228
you know, an older
brother, maybe.

526
00:31:38,296 --> 00:31:41,398
Well, a twisted,
demented older brother,

527
00:31:43,268 --> 00:31:45,602
who taught them
about family values.

528
00:31:45,671 --> 00:31:49,873
No, no. Dad, it
smells under here!

529
00:31:51,709 --> 00:31:53,076
(SCREAMING)

530
00:31:53,145 --> 00:31:55,312
There's a snake behind you.

531
00:31:55,380 --> 00:31:57,147
Oh, I bet there is!

532
00:31:59,418 --> 00:32:02,485
Dad, we're not joking.
It's moving towards you.

533
00:32:02,554 --> 00:32:06,122
Why don't I just open my shirt
and let him crawl right in, huh?

534
00:32:09,561 --> 00:32:11,881
Tim, the snake
wasn't in the bag.

535
00:32:13,299 --> 00:32:15,966
Because the
snake is in my shirt!

536
00:32:17,469 --> 00:32:19,102
I have a woman. Mommy.

537
00:32:19,171 --> 00:32:21,872
Your mommy can't be
your woman, doofus.

538
00:32:21,940 --> 00:32:25,575
A lot of men pay a psychiatrist a
lot of money to figure that one out.

539
00:32:26,945 --> 00:32:28,322
Mom! What?

540
00:32:28,346 --> 00:32:29,524
Dad's cussing. I'm not cussing.

541
00:32:29,548 --> 00:32:31,259
He said a bad
word. It wasn't bad.

542
00:32:31,283 --> 00:32:33,016
Yeah, he said "hell" and "damn."

543
00:32:33,085 --> 00:32:34,751
I did not say "damn."

544
00:32:34,819 --> 00:32:36,019
Now you did.

545
00:32:37,890 --> 00:32:40,101
It's not that big a deal. I
mean, I've had detention before.

546
00:32:40,125 --> 00:32:42,325
It's the first day of school!

547
00:32:44,963 --> 00:32:48,332
No one ever gets detention
on the first day of school.

548
00:32:48,400 --> 00:32:49,967
I wouldn't say "No one."

549
00:32:51,936 --> 00:32:53,948
Oh, it's gonna take
a minute to boot up,

550
00:32:53,972 --> 00:32:56,606
I still have that
old 286 chip on it.

551
00:32:56,675 --> 00:32:58,915
You know, not much power.

552
00:33:02,781 --> 00:33:04,901
Are you saying this
thing needs more power?

553
00:33:06,117 --> 00:33:08,618
Let me open it up. I can
make this thing go faster.

554
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:11,832
Well, why don't we
just save you the trouble

555
00:33:11,856 --> 00:33:14,202
and throw it up
against the wall?

556
00:33:14,226 --> 00:33:16,504
Let me talk about sex for a
minute. BRAD: Dad, I don't wanna...

557
00:33:16,528 --> 00:33:19,040
I want you to listen to me. Listen
up. Can you, please? Listen up.

558
00:33:19,064 --> 00:33:21,164
Sex is...

559
00:33:21,233 --> 00:33:23,399
It's like a car.

560
00:33:23,468 --> 00:33:29,039
The best idea is to keep the car in
the garage for a long, long, long time.

561
00:33:31,443 --> 00:33:34,410
And then, somewhere in
the future, the distant future,

562
00:33:34,479 --> 00:33:39,149
when that garage door opens,
you gotta think, "Car cover."

563
00:33:52,397 --> 00:33:55,165
You know, you just keep
feeding them and they grow up.

564
00:33:55,233 --> 00:33:56,810
Don't they? You know?

565
00:33:56,834 --> 00:33:58,246
Well, you know, sometimes
you read your script,

566
00:33:58,270 --> 00:34:00,803
and you can't wait
to do the episode.

567
00:34:00,872 --> 00:34:03,973
This script scared me.

568
00:34:04,042 --> 00:34:05,908
Called <i>The Vasectomy One.</i> Yeah.

569
00:34:05,977 --> 00:34:07,577
(CHUCKLING)

570
00:34:07,646 --> 00:34:09,613
Tim agreed to have a vasectomy,

571
00:34:09,681 --> 00:34:11,281
and then we told
him what that meant.

572
00:34:13,619 --> 00:34:15,130
But when he got down
to the doctor's office,

573
00:34:15,154 --> 00:34:17,654
there was one thing
that Jill forgot to tell him.

574
00:34:17,722 --> 00:34:21,658
And it went something
like this. Something like this.

575
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:25,995
Hi, Mr. and Mrs. Taylor, I'm
Dr. Kaplan. I'll be with you in a minute.

576
00:34:27,166 --> 00:34:28,899
Harold!

577
00:34:28,967 --> 00:34:32,101
A woman? You brought
me here to see a woman?

578
00:34:32,170 --> 00:34:34,816
I didn't know that she was a
woman. My gynecologist just said

579
00:34:34,840 --> 00:34:38,174
that Dr. Kaplan was
the best urologist in town.

580
00:34:38,243 --> 00:34:42,579
How am I supposed to talk to a woman
about what's going on in man land?

581
00:34:43,449 --> 00:34:46,116
Man land?

582
00:34:46,185 --> 00:34:49,018
Now you got a theme
park between your legs?

583
00:34:54,525 --> 00:34:57,426
My husband, I think,
is just concerned

584
00:34:57,495 --> 00:35:00,441
about how this is gonna
affect his performance.

585
00:35:00,465 --> 00:35:03,366
(CHUCKLING NERVOUSLY)
Honey, let me handle this.

586
00:35:03,434 --> 00:35:05,701
You see, I put on a good show.

587
00:35:08,106 --> 00:35:09,672
And I just wanna make sure

588
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:12,642
the curtain doesn't come down
in the middle of the first act.

589
00:35:12,711 --> 00:35:16,513
This will not, in any way,
affect your sexual function.

590
00:35:16,581 --> 00:35:18,615
We simply cut off
the flow of sperm...

591
00:35:18,683 --> 00:35:20,683
Oh, boy.

592
00:35:20,752 --> 00:35:22,953
To prevent it from
entering the seminal stream.

593
00:35:23,021 --> 00:35:25,822
Mmm-hmm. So I'm
fishing without bait, now.

594
00:35:27,292 --> 00:35:28,959
No bait.

595
00:35:29,027 --> 00:35:31,238
Why don't you tell us what's
involved in the procedure?

596
00:35:31,262 --> 00:35:33,663
Yeah, I'm dying to hear this.

597
00:35:33,732 --> 00:35:35,410
Well, the morning
of your appointment,

598
00:35:35,434 --> 00:35:38,768
you'd have to shave in the area
where I'll be making the incisions.

599
00:35:38,837 --> 00:35:41,738
Shave? Here?

600
00:35:42,640 --> 00:35:44,407
It's just a routine procedure.

601
00:35:44,476 --> 00:35:46,208
Not in my house, it's not.

602
00:35:48,312 --> 00:35:49,891
What do you think? I
wake up in the morning,

603
00:35:49,915 --> 00:35:53,383
brush my teeth, comb my
hair and shave ping and pong?

604
00:35:57,956 --> 00:36:02,625
The first thing I do is give
you a shot that's a local.

605
00:36:02,694 --> 00:36:04,975
Local, like here in Detroit?

606
00:36:06,064 --> 00:36:07,864
No, local, like here
in your scrotum.

607
00:36:07,933 --> 00:36:10,567
Oh, boy.

608
00:36:10,635 --> 00:36:12,313
That does sting
for a few seconds.

609
00:36:12,337 --> 00:36:13,803
You think?

610
00:36:19,844 --> 00:36:23,112
Forget about it, Wilson. I'm the kind
of guy that likes to stand his ground.

611
00:36:23,181 --> 00:36:24,880
Whoa. Whoa. Whoa...

612
00:36:25,517 --> 00:36:27,283
(GROANING)

613
00:36:29,554 --> 00:36:32,034
You okay there, Tim? Oh, yeah.

614
00:36:34,326 --> 00:36:36,526
Yeah, I just was tired
of using that ladder.

615
00:36:39,398 --> 00:36:41,631
Wilson...

616
00:36:41,700 --> 00:36:43,811
Oh, I love that part. Wilson
was played by Earl Hindman,

617
00:36:43,835 --> 00:36:46,181
who couldn't be here because
he's doing a play in New York City.

618
00:36:46,205 --> 00:36:48,483
He was one of my favorite
characters on the show,

619
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:49,750
really one of my
favorite actors,

620
00:36:49,774 --> 00:36:51,854
and certainly one
of my favorite friends.

621
00:36:51,910 --> 00:36:54,755
You know, he lived next door to
us for eight years, but, you know,

622
00:36:54,779 --> 00:36:57,980
I got to say, I just never
saw enough of the guy.

623
00:36:59,818 --> 00:37:01,518
Tim, you growing a beard?

624
00:37:03,421 --> 00:37:04,654
What do you think?

625
00:37:04,722 --> 00:37:06,689
Well, I'm not sure,

626
00:37:06,758 --> 00:37:10,038
I could never understand why a
man would want to hide his face.

627
00:37:10,928 --> 00:37:13,440
There was a time when I
thought my extensive research

628
00:37:13,464 --> 00:37:16,266
into ancient tribal cultures,
obscure scientific data,

629
00:37:16,334 --> 00:37:19,735
the thoughts of great philosophers
would never come in handy.

630
00:37:19,804 --> 00:37:22,739
Then you moved in.

631
00:37:22,808 --> 00:37:28,411
Well, Tim, I'm reminded of
what Aristotle said about Plato.

632
00:37:28,480 --> 00:37:32,082
"Keep the lid on tight, otherwise it'll
all dry out." That's what I tell Mark.

633
00:37:35,453 --> 00:37:38,821
I like to create, Wilson. Everything I
do, I wanna make bigger and better.

634
00:37:38,890 --> 00:37:44,093
Well, Tim, this obsessive
desire to create partly happens

635
00:37:44,162 --> 00:37:46,796
because men feel
inferior to women.

636
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,297
(GRUNTS)

637
00:37:49,634 --> 00:37:51,645
It's because we
can't bear children.

638
00:37:51,669 --> 00:37:53,669
I don't mind the boys that much.

639
00:37:58,943 --> 00:38:01,478
Wilson, you're not
making me feel any better.

640
00:38:01,546 --> 00:38:06,615
Well, excuse me, why do I always
have to be Santa's little helper?

641
00:38:06,684 --> 00:38:09,385
Well... I mean, I have wants,

642
00:38:09,454 --> 00:38:12,333
I have needs, I have issues, but
does anyone ever come to the fence

643
00:38:12,357 --> 00:38:14,302
and say, "Wilson, do
you have a problem?"

644
00:38:14,326 --> 00:38:16,893
I mean, no! It's just
"Me, me, me, me!"

645
00:38:27,138 --> 00:38:28,138
Tim?

646
00:38:28,206 --> 00:38:29,739
Wilson, you up?

647
00:38:31,977 --> 00:38:33,643
I am now.

648
00:38:33,712 --> 00:38:36,546
Have you ever had a
real annoying neighbor?

649
00:38:41,920 --> 00:38:44,201
Tim, is this a trick question?

650
00:38:49,761 --> 00:38:51,894
I sure miss you,
Earl. I really do.

651
00:38:51,963 --> 00:38:55,598
Wilson often quoted
philosopher Joseph Campbell,

652
00:38:55,666 --> 00:38:59,902
who said, "Before you can
create, you must destroy."

653
00:39:01,439 --> 00:39:03,279

wear a necktie.

We get a lot of
letters about this.

659
00:39:22,160 --> 00:39:23,438
You want nothing hanging down,

660

clothing. Possibility...

00:41:19,076 --> 00:41:20,643
Al, you all right?

687
00:41:20,712 --> 00:41:22,111
Look out!

688
00:41:22,179 --> 00:41:23,924
Tim, your foot. Don't
hit the brake release!

689
00:41:23,948 --> 00:41:25,081
What?

690
00:41:36,561 --> 00:41:39,573
Good night, everybody.
Good night! Bye!

691
00:41:39,597 --> 00:41:41,464
(AUDIENCE CHEERING)

692
00:41:43,969 --> 00:41:45,768
Hey, just a little bow.

693
00:41:45,837 --> 00:41:47,770
TIM: A bow. AL: A bow!

694
00:41:50,608 --> 00:41:55,445
<i>HINDMAN: You know, we always close
our show with bloopers. Guess what?</i>

695
00:41:55,513 --> 00:41:59,882
Yes, you don't wanna be the only
one with an incredibly desirable woman.

696
00:42:06,724 --> 00:42:09,191
Kiss me before
I get rigor mortis.

697
00:42:12,430 --> 00:42:14,062
Mmm.

698
00:42:14,131 --> 00:42:16,443
That just caused rigor
mortis in a fashion.

699
00:42:16,467 --> 00:42:17,800
