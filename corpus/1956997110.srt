00:00:03,169 --> 00:00:04,838
(air wooshing)

2
00:00:17,976 --> 00:00:20,812
(cheerful music)

3
00:00:38,955 --> 00:00:41,791
(dog whimpering)

4
00:00:45,670 --> 00:00:48,757
- Mmm, Dash, I am not getting up

5
00:00:48,798 --> 00:00:50,800
till the alarm clock goes off.

6
00:00:50,842 --> 00:00:52,177
- [Radio Announcer] Goodmorning.

00:00:52,218 --> 00:00:53,803

Wow, how the holiday's sneak upon you.

9
00:00:55,930 --> 00:00:57,932
I could have sworn, last weekit was just Thanksgiving.

10
00:00:57,932 --> 00:00:59,934
Here's a Christmas songthat you are gonna love.

11
00:00:59,934 --> 00:01:04,272
k Smile and come, Christmastimeis here

12
00:01:05,607 --> 00:01:07,567
- All right, all right, I'm up.

13
00:01:07,609 --> 00:01:10,236
(bright music)

14
00:01:18,411 --> 00:01:23,166
k The raindrops falling on myface

15
00:01:23,208 --> 00:01:27,504
k Invite my soul to take a taste

16
00:01:27,545 --> 00:01:30,965
k As thunder spreads its wings

17
00:01:30,965 --> 00:01:34,302
k Into the space of me

18
00:01:37,972 --> 00:01:42,102
k I tilt my head toward the sky

19
00:01:42,811 --> 00:01:47,148
k And laugh out loud as cars goby

20
00:01:47,148 --> 00:01:51,528
k It's been so long sinceI have felt alive inside

21
00:01:56,241 --> 00:02:01,162
k Now I'm free to jump, I'm freeto fall

22
00:02:01,162 --> 00:02:06,042
k Free to let it rollaway when I drop the ball

23
00:02:06,084 --> 00:02:10,755
k I'm not ashamed to break downand cry

24
00:02:10,797 --> 00:02:15,134
k So come on precaution, take astep aside

25
00:02:15,927 --> 00:02:19,139
k 'Cause you see it's boring

26
00:02:19,180 --> 00:02:22,809
k It's teaching me to fly

27
00:02:31,734 --> 00:02:36,489
k There's a breeze that'sblowing past my door

28
00:02:36,531 --> 00:02:41,035
k And it's bringing changelike I have never known before

29
00:02:41,035 --> 00:02:45,415
k It used to be thatwhen it rained it poured

30
00:02:47,876 --> 00:02:50,128
k Not any more so give me more

31
00:02:50,169 --> 00:02:52,672
k 'Cause I'm free to jump

32
00:02:52,714 --> 00:02:54,966

k Free to let it roll away

00:02:57,176 --> 00:02:59,804
k When I drop the ball

35
00:02:59,846 --> 00:03:04,684
k I'm not ashamed to break downand cry

36
00:03:04,726 --> 00:03:09,731
k So come on precaution, take astep aside

37
00:03:09,731 --> 00:03:13,318

38
00:03:13,359 --> 00:03:15,612
- Hi, this message is for Ms.Hendrix.

00:03:20,950 --> 00:03:23,119
Maybe Mr. Hendrix could help?

00:03:23,161 --> 00:03:25,830
Please give me a call, thanks.

43
00:03:26,748 --> 00:03:27,749
(whimpers)

I got to go.

47
00:03:33,004 --> 00:03:34,756
Morning, Nick.

48
00:03:34,756 --> 00:03:36,216
- Morning, Ashley.

49
00:03:36,257 --> 00:03:38,134
Get your Christmas tree yet?

50
00:03:38,176 --> 00:03:40,637
- (laughs) It's barely December.

51
00:03:40,678 --> 00:03:43,056
- Yeah well, nothing wrongwith getting a jump-start,

52
00:03:43,097 --> 00:03:44,390
only comes once a year.

53
00:03:44,432 --> 00:03:45,600
- So does hurricane season.

54
00:03:45,642 --> 00:03:46,726
Where you off to?

55
00:03:46,768 --> 00:03:48,937
- Oh, I got to go toa friends across town.

56
00:03:48,937 --> 00:03:50,563
Bus takes an hour and a half.

57
00:03:50,605 --> 00:03:51,272
You?

58
00:03:51,314 --> 00:03:53,775
- Job interview at 8:30.

59
00:03:53,775 --> 00:03:55,735
- Well, you better hustle.

60
00:03:55,777 --> 00:03:57,445
- [Ashley] Meet you at thediner?

61
00:03:57,487 --> 00:03:58,738
- Count on it.

62
00:04:00,114 --> 00:04:02,951
(car engine sputtering)

63
00:04:02,951 --> 00:04:04,285
- Come on.

64
00:04:04,285 --> 00:04:05,370
Oh, come on.

65
00:04:09,040 --> 00:04:09,916
The bus.

66
00:04:13,461 --> 00:04:17,215
(cheerful Christmas music)

67
00:04:32,105 --> 00:04:34,440
- Who cares what Forslink issaying.

68
00:04:34,482 --> 00:04:36,609
Look, I know what I heard.

69
00:04:36,651 --> 00:04:38,027
I've got the tapes to prove it.

70
00:04:38,069 --> 00:04:41,322
Claire did the fact checking,everything came back clean.

71
00:04:41,322 --> 00:04:42,073
All right.

72
00:04:42,115 --> 00:04:44,534
I'm right around the corner.

73
00:04:48,496 --> 00:04:49,414
Oh, my gosh.

74
00:04:49,455 --> 00:04:50,164
I am sorry.- I'm sorry.

75
00:04:50,373 --> 00:04:51,958
- Are you OK?- Yeah, are you?

76
00:04:52,000 --> 00:04:54,502
- Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah no.

77
00:04:54,502 --> 00:04:56,629
(both laughing)

78
00:04:56,671 --> 00:04:57,797
Sorry, again.

79
00:04:57,839 --> 00:04:58,673
- It's OK.

80
00:04:58,965 --> 00:05:02,010
With the day I'm having,a train will hit me next.

81
00:05:02,010 --> 00:05:04,012
- Ashley Matthews.

82
00:05:04,053 --> 00:05:05,138
Job hunting?

83
00:05:07,348 --> 00:05:08,224
- Yeah.

84
00:05:10,351 --> 00:05:12,270
I gotta catch the bus.

85
00:05:13,021 --> 00:05:14,731
- Nice to meet you.

86
00:05:15,732 --> 00:05:17,817
(phone ringing)

87
00:05:17,859 --> 00:05:19,360
Oh!

88
00:05:19,360 --> 00:05:20,278
Hey you!

89
00:05:26,075 --> 00:05:26,951
Hello?

90
00:05:29,203 --> 00:05:31,748
No, she's not here right now.

91
00:05:33,249 --> 00:05:36,544
I'll make sure she gets thatmessage.

92
00:05:40,882 --> 00:05:41,758
Morning.

93
00:05:45,386 --> 00:05:46,220
(exhales sharply)

94
00:05:46,220 --> 00:05:47,972
- You selfish conniving, jerk.

95
00:05:48,014 --> 00:05:49,390
- Francine, good morning.

96
00:05:49,390 --> 00:05:50,516
I see we're picking upright where we left off.

97
00:05:50,808 --> 00:05:52,810
- You just can't resist thechance to slander someone.

98
00:05:52,852 --> 00:05:53,895
- Oh, fancy lawyer talk.

99
00:05:54,187 --> 00:05:57,065
Actually, counselor, slanderis verbal, libel is written.

100
00:05:57,106 --> 00:05:58,691
Fine, libel, don't get mesidetracked.

101
00:05:58,733 --> 00:06:00,568
Too easy.- Forslink is not happy.

102
00:06:00,568 --> 00:06:01,444
- So?

103
00:06:02,236 --> 00:06:03,571
- You know, I don't know why Bobcontinues

104
00:06:03,571 --> 00:06:04,614
to print your stories.

105
00:06:04,864 --> 00:06:06,783
- Because they're good andthey sell more magazines,

106
00:06:06,824 --> 00:06:08,743
which I believe is the point,don't you?

107
00:06:08,785 --> 00:06:10,370
- Pat yourself on the back allyou want.

108
00:06:10,411 --> 00:06:11,621
You screwed up.

109
00:06:11,662 --> 00:06:12,914
- Screwed up?

110
00:06:12,914 --> 00:06:14,082
- Please, you act so innocent.

111
00:06:14,082 --> 00:06:15,833
Could you just be a man for once

112
00:06:15,875 --> 00:06:17,335
and own up to what you did?

113
00:06:17,377 --> 00:06:18,461
- I write what I want.

114
00:06:18,503 --> 00:06:19,587
- That's for sure.- If you have a problem

115
00:06:19,962 --> 00:06:23,257
with that, because it makesyou do your job, deal with it.

116
00:06:23,299 --> 00:06:25,927
- Have you even heard one wordI've said?

117
00:06:25,927 --> 00:06:28,054
- Not really, I've gottenvery good at tuning you out.

118
00:06:28,096 --> 00:06:30,181
(sighs)Francy.

119
00:06:30,223 --> 00:06:32,058
If you have a problem with thestory, take it up with Bob.

120
00:06:32,100 --> 00:06:33,768
He obviously felt it wasfine enough to print.

121
00:06:33,810 --> 00:06:36,354
- You need to stop hiding behindhim.

122
00:06:36,396 --> 00:06:37,980
- You're just ticked he's got myback.

123
00:06:38,022 --> 00:06:39,065
- Bob wants to see you.

124
00:06:39,107 --> 00:06:42,401
- (gasps) Excuse me.

125
00:06:42,443 --> 00:06:44,153
Bob wants to see me.

126
00:06:46,155 --> 00:06:47,115
- Yeah, that makes completesense--

127
00:06:47,115 --> 00:06:47,949
(knocks)

128
00:06:47,949 --> 00:06:50,201
Look, I'll call you back.

129
00:06:50,243 --> 00:06:52,703
William Price, have a seat.

130
00:06:52,745 --> 00:06:54,163
- What's going on?

131
00:06:54,205 --> 00:06:55,164
You only call me by my full name

132
00:06:55,206 --> 00:06:57,959
when you've had too muchcaffeine.

133
00:06:57,959 --> 00:06:58,960
Is Forslink crying?

134
00:06:59,001 --> 00:07:00,336
- Do they have a reason to?

135
00:07:00,378 --> 00:07:02,547
- Well, every time I writean article, somebody cries.

136
00:07:02,588 --> 00:07:04,048
- Yes, and I'm beginning towonder

137
00:07:04,090 --> 00:07:06,425
if that's a bad thing now.

138
00:07:06,467 --> 00:07:07,635
- What are you talking about?

139
00:07:07,677 --> 00:07:09,470
- I know Claire fact checkedyour story

140
00:07:09,512 --> 00:07:10,972
and it panned out at first,

141
00:07:10,972 --> 00:07:13,391
but she went back when wegot the screaming complaints

142
00:07:13,432 --> 00:07:15,143
and threatened legal action.

143
00:07:15,184 --> 00:07:15,893
- Legal? No.

144
00:07:16,144 --> 00:07:17,520
They don't have a leg to standon.

145
00:07:17,562 --> 00:07:19,939
- Francine agrees, lucky you.

146
00:07:19,981 --> 00:07:21,190
But Claire found somethinginteresting

147
00:07:21,232 --> 00:07:23,484
when she went through thetapes of your interview.

148
00:07:23,526 --> 00:07:25,903
Your source said thecompany was lagging behind,

149
00:07:25,945 --> 00:07:29,073
but he meant lagging behindin the so-called green areas.

150
00:07:29,115 --> 00:07:31,367
You, however, implied the entirecompany

151
00:07:31,409 --> 00:07:32,660
is on the verge of going under.

152
00:07:32,660 --> 00:07:33,953
- It is.

153
00:07:33,995 --> 00:07:35,621
- And how about you?

154
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,498
You took the facts out ofcontext.

155
00:07:37,540 --> 00:07:40,751
You spun the story to slamForslink.

156
00:07:41,627 --> 00:07:43,129
- Are you firing me?

157
00:07:43,171 --> 00:07:45,548
- [Bob] No, but you owe me.

158
00:07:48,342 --> 00:07:49,969
- What do you want me to do?

159
00:07:50,011 --> 00:07:52,305
- Claire, who feels like thiswhole thing is her fault,

160
00:07:52,346 --> 00:07:55,224
bless her heart, is going tobe taking maternity leave,

161
00:07:55,266 --> 00:07:57,268
so we're down one fact checker.

162
00:07:57,310 --> 00:07:59,854
You'll do her job, justso you can find out

163
00:07:59,896 --> 00:08:02,190
what the truth really lookslike.

164
00:08:02,231 --> 00:08:03,774
- You're benching me.

165
00:08:03,816 --> 00:08:07,695
- Benching implies that this istemporary.

166
00:08:07,695 --> 00:08:11,949
When Claire gets backwe'll re-evaluate it then.

167
00:08:15,661 --> 00:08:16,746
- Don't do this.

168
00:08:16,787 --> 00:08:18,623
I mean, is this Francine's idea?

169
00:08:18,664 --> 00:08:19,749
I am a writer.

170
00:08:19,790 --> 00:08:21,709
- Fine, write all youwant in your spare time,

171
00:08:21,751 --> 00:08:23,628
but I'm not gonna publish a wordof it

172
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:28,049
until you can prove that youcan report and not invent.

173
00:08:34,514 --> 00:08:35,264
- Hello.

174
00:08:35,306 --> 00:08:36,140
How may I help you?

175
00:08:36,182 --> 00:08:37,433
- Hi, I'm Ashley Matthews.

176
00:08:37,475 --> 00:08:39,685
I have an interview with, um.

177
00:08:39,727 --> 00:08:41,145
- The position's been filled.

178
00:08:41,187 --> 00:08:42,647
We called you this morning.

179
00:08:42,688 --> 00:08:45,733
- Oh, I don't think you did, areyou sure?

180
00:08:45,733 --> 00:08:46,525
- We called.

181
00:08:46,776 --> 00:08:47,568
- Because I have my cell phoneright here

182
00:08:47,777 --> 00:08:48,986
and I would have heard it ring.

183
00:08:49,028 --> 00:08:50,238
- Do you think arguing aboutthis

184
00:08:50,238 --> 00:08:54,533
is gonna change the factthe job's already taken?

185
00:08:57,495 --> 00:08:59,622
(scoffs)

186
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,002
- Oh, Ms. Hendrix.

187
00:09:05,044 --> 00:09:05,878

00:09:06,128 --> 00:09:08,381
- Um, about the runningwater in my apartment.

189
00:09:08,422 --> 00:09:10,591
- Oh, it's still giving youtrouble then?

190
00:09:10,633 --> 00:09:12,260
- This is like the fourthtime it's gone out.

191
00:09:12,301 --> 00:09:15,096
Should I talk to Mr. Hendrix?

192
00:09:15,096 --> 00:09:16,347
- He's away.

193
00:09:16,389 --> 00:09:17,974
- When will he be back?

194
00:09:18,015 --> 00:09:18,849
- Very soon.

195
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:20,601
- Mrs. Hendrix, I don'thave any running water

196
00:09:20,643 --> 00:09:24,772

00:09:24,772 --> 00:09:28,859
- Oh, maybe it willcome back on again then.

198
00:09:28,901 --> 00:09:32,572
We'll get it fixed just as soonas we can.

199
00:09:37,535 --> 00:09:40,246

200
00:09:41,289 --> 00:09:44,250

209
00:10:02,476 --> 00:10:03,477
- Friend?

210
00:10:03,477 --> 00:10:04,645
Oh, yeah.

211
00:10:04,645 --> 00:10:07,023
He's telling me things I don'twanna hear.

212
00:10:07,064 --> 00:10:09,150
How's your interview?

213
00:10:09,150 --> 00:10:10,610
- Don't ask.

214
00:10:10,651 --> 00:10:13,571
- Well, I already asked, I can'tun-ask.

215
00:10:13,613 --> 00:10:15,072
- It did not go well.

216
00:10:15,114 --> 00:10:16,657
Story of my life.

217
00:10:16,699 --> 00:10:18,451
- So, what happened?

218
00:10:18,492 --> 00:10:19,577
- Nick, I really, you know Ijust...

219
00:10:19,869 --> 00:10:21,871
- Well you didn't say anythingabout follow up questions.

220
00:10:21,912 --> 00:10:23,164
What happened?

221
00:10:23,164 --> 00:10:24,415
- OK.

222
00:10:24,457 --> 00:10:25,333
Fine.

223
00:10:25,583 --> 00:10:27,168
Well, first, when I'm halfway through my shower,

224
00:10:27,168 --> 00:10:29,045
the water goes out, again,

225
00:10:29,086 --> 00:10:31,630
so I have to wash my hairout in Dash's water bowl.

226
00:10:31,672 --> 00:10:34,675
So I'm running late andI smell like dog water.

227
00:10:34,675 --> 00:10:37,011
I get to my car and ofcourse it doesn't start,

228
00:10:37,053 --> 00:10:38,346
so I have to run and catch thebus

229
00:10:38,346 --> 00:10:40,097
and while I'm running Iliterally collide

230
00:10:40,139 --> 00:10:43,225
with some random guy, lose myphone, so I don't get the call

231
00:10:43,267 --> 00:10:44,685
that the position's already beentaken

232
00:10:44,685 --> 00:10:45,853
and I don't need to get on thebus

233
00:10:45,895 --> 00:10:47,688
to the interview I'm alreadylate for.

234
00:10:47,688 --> 00:10:48,731
(laughs)

235
00:10:48,773 --> 00:10:52,860
- Wait, you washed your hair indog water?

236
00:10:52,902 --> 00:10:55,196
- I'm so glad you focuson the important things.

237
00:10:55,196 --> 00:10:57,031
- That's pretty funny.

238
00:10:57,073 --> 00:10:59,200
- And to make it worse,it's the most depressing

239
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:00,493
time of the year.

240
00:11:00,534 --> 00:11:01,952
- What do you mean, it'sChristmas?

241
00:11:01,994 --> 00:11:02,745
- Yeah, Christmas.

242
00:11:02,995 --> 00:11:04,789
It's this soulless commercialendeavor

243
00:11:04,830 --> 00:11:07,041
that encouragesoverspending and overeating.

244
00:11:07,041 --> 00:11:08,084
- Oh please.

245
00:11:09,043 --> 00:11:09,960
Is that all?

246
00:11:10,002 --> 00:11:10,795
- No.

247
00:11:11,045 --> 00:11:13,047
I mean, the Christmascolors, red and green,

248
00:11:13,089 --> 00:11:14,632
even I know those don't gotogether.

249
00:11:14,673 --> 00:11:15,424
(Nick chuckles)

250
00:11:15,674 --> 00:11:17,968
And what's with the Christmascarols?

251
00:11:18,010 --> 00:11:19,720
The Little Drummer Boy?

252
00:11:19,720 --> 00:11:20,888
Who's this boy?

253
00:11:20,930 --> 00:11:24,016
And drums don't gopa-rum-pum-pum-pum.

254
00:11:24,058 --> 00:11:28,437
- Well, there's more to itthen that, don't you think?

255
00:11:30,064 --> 00:11:30,940
- Yeah.

256
00:11:31,982 --> 00:11:36,445
Christmas is a time to spendwith your friends and family.

257
00:11:38,072 --> 00:11:39,573
But when you don't have that,

258
00:11:39,615 --> 00:11:43,285
Christmas isn't all it's crackedup to be.

259
00:11:43,327 --> 00:11:45,204
- Well you have Dash.

260
00:11:46,163 --> 00:11:47,289
- Yeah, Dash.

261
00:11:48,040 --> 00:11:50,751
When he showed up on my doorsteplast year

262
00:11:50,793 --> 00:11:53,921
it was the best Christmas ever.

263
00:11:53,963 --> 00:11:57,383
And before that it was, oh,never mind.

264
00:11:58,801 --> 00:12:01,387
All I know is that if I don'tfind a job,

265
00:12:01,429 --> 00:12:04,306
I'm going to have to moveout of my cruddy apartment

266
00:12:04,348 --> 00:12:06,100
and won't be able to fix my carand worse,

267
00:12:06,142 --> 00:12:09,311
I'm gonna have to give up Dash.

268
00:12:09,353 --> 00:12:12,982
I know in the big scheme ofthings I'm like, this big,

269
00:12:13,023 --> 00:12:16,402
but is it too much to ask for abreak?

270
00:12:17,611 --> 00:12:19,989
- Things will turn around.

271
00:12:20,030 --> 00:12:23,242
Listen, I got the perfect jobfor you.

272
00:12:23,284 --> 00:12:24,285
- Really, what?

273
00:12:24,618 --> 00:12:28,038
- Well, it's seasonal, butjust because it's Christmassy

274
00:12:28,080 --> 00:12:30,666
doesn't mean you won't like it.

275
00:12:30,708 --> 00:12:32,251
- OK, beggars can't be choosers.

276
00:12:32,293 --> 00:12:33,085
What kind of work is it?

277
00:12:33,127 --> 00:12:34,086
- It's a personal assistant.

278
00:12:34,295 --> 00:12:37,465
You run errands, oddjobs, things like that.

279
00:12:37,506 --> 00:12:41,469
It gets a little busier thecloser it gets to Christmas.

280
00:12:41,469 --> 00:12:43,262
- Where'd you hear about it?

281
00:12:43,304 --> 00:12:45,681
- I know the guy that's hiring.

282
00:12:45,723 --> 00:12:46,891
- Who is he?

283
00:12:46,932 --> 00:12:49,018
- You're looking at him.

284
00:12:49,852 --> 00:12:51,312
- I can't work for you.

285
00:12:51,312 --> 00:12:52,188
- Why not?

286
00:12:52,480 --> 00:12:54,523
- Nick, you can't afforda personal assistant.

287
00:12:54,565 --> 00:12:55,524
- I got money.

288
00:12:55,566 --> 00:12:57,651
- I'm not gonna take your money.

289
00:12:57,651 --> 00:12:59,028
- Well, it's not doing me anygood

290
00:12:59,069 --> 00:13:00,654
sitting in the cookie jar.

291
00:13:00,696 --> 00:13:03,240
- Nick, I appreciate thegesture, but.

292
00:13:03,282 --> 00:13:05,743
- So what's the problem?

293
00:13:05,784 --> 00:13:09,288
(gentle Christmas music)

294
00:13:17,546 --> 00:13:19,340
- Hey Will, what do you know?

- I know, crazy isn't it?

299
00:13:24,929 --> 00:13:27,056
- Santa's coming too, any daynow.

300
00:13:27,097 --> 00:13:28,599
- Course he is.

301
00:13:28,641 --> 00:13:31,060
- Last year he gave me $100.

302
00:13:32,061 --> 00:13:33,020
- Wow.

303
00:13:33,062 --> 00:13:34,855

304
00:13:34,855 --> 00:13:39,026

305
00:13:39,068 --> 00:13:40,694
I invested it.

306
00:13:40,694 --> 00:13:42,696

- Can you start work tomorrow?

311
00:13:51,664 --> 00:13:53,040

tried to ask me out.

354
00:15:40,814 --> 00:15:43,150
- Did you try to say yes?

355
00:15:43,150 --> 00:15:45,194

You know me and Dash.

359
00:15:49,031 --> 00:15:51,909
You should make an effortto get to know people.

360
00:15:51,951 --> 00:15:54,870
- Nick, it took me like sixmonths to even say hi to you.

361
00:15:54,912 --> 00:15:58,957
- Yeah, well, I'm notgonna be around forever.

362
00:16:00,876 --> 00:16:05,130
You should try and getover your fear of people.

363
00:16:06,090 --> 00:16:08,676
- I'm not afraid of people.

364
00:16:08,717 --> 00:16:10,511
I just don't trust them, bigdifference.

365
00:16:10,511 --> 00:16:14,974
- Yeah, well, a guy asks youout, I say you should go.

366
00:16:15,808 --> 00:16:17,518
- And I say you shouldn't worryabout me.

367
00:16:17,559 --> 00:16:20,062
I'm gonna go grab myphone and I'll be fine.

368
00:16:20,104 --> 00:16:21,146
- What time?

369
00:16:21,188 --> 00:16:22,523
- Eight o'clock.

370
00:16:22,523 --> 00:16:26,735
- Oh, you'll be late foryour first day at work.

371
00:16:27,486 --> 00:16:29,905
- I'm so sorry, I totallyforgot.

372
00:16:29,947 --> 00:16:31,448
- Well, I'll let it slide.

373
00:16:31,490 --> 00:16:32,866
- I'll be quick, I'llrun down to the diner,

374
00:16:32,908 --> 00:16:34,994

375
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,412
- [Nick] OK, good.

376
00:16:36,453 --> 00:16:39,289
(cheerful music)

377
00:16:50,259 --> 00:16:52,302
- [Ashley] Will?

378
00:16:52,344 --> 00:16:53,679
- Ashley, good morning.

379
00:16:53,721 --> 00:16:54,513
- [Ashley] Hi.

380
00:16:54,555 --> 00:16:55,806
- How you doing?

381
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:56,974
- Fine, I guess.

382
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:58,142
- Good, good.

383
00:16:59,768 --> 00:17:01,729
- So, can I get my phone back?

384
00:17:01,770 --> 00:17:04,064
- Oh, yeah (laughs)

385
00:17:04,106 --> 00:17:05,524
of course.

386
00:17:05,566 --> 00:17:06,650
Right to the point.

387
00:17:06,692 --> 00:17:07,526
- Thank you.- Yeah.

388
00:17:07,568 --> 00:17:10,320
Hey, can I ask you a question?

389
00:17:10,362 --> 00:17:11,196
- OK.

390
00:17:12,489 --> 00:17:16,869
- It's less of a question,more of an invitation.

391
00:17:18,579 --> 00:17:20,664
Do you want to go out some time?

392
00:17:20,706 --> 00:17:24,585
- I don't think that's such agood idea.

393
00:17:24,585 --> 00:17:26,253
- For you or for me?

394
00:17:26,295 --> 00:17:27,921
Or for both of us?

395
00:17:27,963 --> 00:17:30,215
- Both of us, yeah.

396
00:17:30,257 --> 00:17:31,759
- Why, is there something wrongwith you?

397
00:17:31,800 --> 00:17:33,051
- What?- No...

398
00:17:35,304 --> 00:17:36,388
That came out wrong.

399
00:17:36,430 --> 00:17:37,848
- Is there something wrong withyou?

400
00:17:37,890 --> 00:17:38,766
- That's a very valid point.

401
00:17:38,807 --> 00:17:39,767
(laughs)

402
00:17:39,808 --> 00:17:42,060
Uh, in the interest of fulldisclosure,

403
00:17:42,102 --> 00:17:43,979
I haven't had a girlfriend forsix months

404
00:17:44,021 --> 00:17:47,149
and I'm a little hostile towardswomen,

405
00:17:47,191 --> 00:17:48,776
plus my x-girlfriend, she did anumber

406
00:17:48,817 --> 00:17:50,360
on my head and...

407
00:17:52,196 --> 00:17:54,698
I'm over-sharing (laughs).

408
00:17:54,740 --> 00:17:56,784
I sound a little pathetic here,don't I?

409
00:17:56,784 --> 00:17:58,285
- Yeah, a little.

410
00:17:59,286 --> 00:18:04,041
But, you know, I'mprobably worse, so it's OK.

411
00:18:04,083 --> 00:18:05,793
- Is that a yes?

412
00:18:05,834 --> 00:18:06,627
- What?

413
00:18:06,668 --> 00:18:07,795
No, no, I, I.

414
00:18:08,754 --> 00:18:09,671
- No.

415
00:18:10,839 --> 00:18:11,965
- What's your angle?

416
00:18:11,965 --> 00:18:12,841
- Angle?

417
00:18:13,801 --> 00:18:14,635
I don't have an angle,

418
00:18:14,635 --> 00:18:17,638
I just want to take you out.

419
00:18:17,679 --> 00:18:19,014
- Occupation?

420
00:18:19,056 --> 00:18:20,349
- Journalist.

421
00:18:20,390 --> 00:18:21,475
Modern Business Weekly.

422
00:18:21,517 --> 00:18:23,894
- Oh, never heard of it.

423
00:18:23,936 --> 00:18:24,770
- OK.

424
00:18:25,479 --> 00:18:27,147
- How do you feel aboutChristmas?

425
00:18:27,147 --> 00:18:28,857
- I love Christmas.

426
00:18:32,861 --> 00:18:34,154
- OK.

427
00:18:34,154 --> 00:18:37,991
How do you feel aboutThe Little Drummer Boy?

428
00:18:38,033 --> 00:18:38,951
- Person or song?

429
00:18:38,992 --> 00:18:40,953
- Song, then person.

430
00:18:40,994 --> 00:18:42,412
- Both needless.

431
00:18:44,081 --> 00:18:44,957
- OK.

432
00:18:46,250 --> 00:18:48,544
But if I'm gonna go out with you

433
00:18:48,585 --> 00:18:51,839
it has to be sooner then later.

434
00:18:51,839 --> 00:18:53,173
- Why?

435
00:18:53,173 --> 00:18:57,177
- Because if not, I'lltalk myself out of it.

436
00:18:58,178 --> 00:19:00,389
- OK, how about some time nextweek?

437
00:19:00,430 --> 00:19:02,015
- More like tomorrow?

438
00:19:02,057 --> 00:19:05,185
- Oh, uh yeah, no, I can swingthat.

439
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:07,354
How about around--- 7:00?

440

448
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:29,751
He must have made an impression.

449
00:19:29,793 --> 00:19:31,503
- Mm, I don't know.

450
00:19:33,839 --> 00:19:35,632
So what do you want me to do?

451
00:19:35,674 --> 00:19:38,176
- I want you to take a walk.

00:19:38,218 --> 00:19:39,887

- No.

457
00:19:48,562 --> 00:19:49,938
- You never told me why youneed an assistant, Nick.

Hence dinner.

- I think she's a bit ofchallenge.

528
00:22:52,037 --> 00:22:54,748
- Oh what, she doesn't worshipthe ground you float above.

529
00:22:54,748 --> 00:22:57,417

You knew what you were gettinginto.

531

535
00:23:07,803 --> 00:23:09,596

00:23:33,370 --> 00:23:34,871
You want a drink of water?

546
00:23:34,913 --> 00:23:35,789
- Sure.

547
00:23:35,831 --> 00:23:36,790
- Have a seat.

548
00:23:36,832 --> 00:23:37,749

549
00:23:41,378 --> 00:23:42,587
Waters out again, huh?

550
00:23:42,629 --> 00:23:44,965
- Yeah, I got some bottled.

551
00:23:45,924 --> 00:23:47,259
So how'd it go?

552
00:23:48,218 --> 00:23:49,052
- Fine.

553
00:23:50,303 --> 00:23:52,806
So, what is all this anyway?

554
00:23:53,974 --> 00:23:55,392
- It's your work.

555
00:23:55,433 --> 00:23:56,184
- Mine.

556
00:23:56,226 --> 00:23:57,310
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.

557
00:23:57,310 --> 00:23:59,312

558
00:23:59,312 --> 00:24:00,564
- Read it.

559
00:24:00,605 --> 00:24:01,773
- All of it?

560
00:24:01,815 --> 00:24:03,400
- Well, I'll help.

561
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:05,902
- There's a lot in there

562
00:24:05,944 --> 00:24:07,404
it's gonna take me all night toread.

563
00:24:07,445 --> 00:24:08,321
- Yeah, well.

564
00:24:08,363 --> 00:24:09,656
Thanks.- It'll go a lot faster

565
00:24:09,656 --> 00:24:10,949

566
00:24:10,991 --> 00:24:12,701
I made you dinner.

567
00:24:12,742 --> 00:24:13,785
- Thank you.

568
00:24:16,163 --> 00:24:18,081
(heartfelt music)

569
00:24:18,123 --> 00:24:19,749
Julianne Ryan age seven.

00:24:19,791 --> 00:24:22,127
Mother is in Iraq with themarines.

571
00:24:22,169 --> 00:24:24,045

572
00:24:24,087 --> 00:24:25,922
Rose has Diabetes and needsmedication

and a new hearing aid.

574
00:24:27,299 --> 00:24:29,009
Julianne needs new shoes.

575
00:24:29,050 --> 00:24:32,053
She loves Barbie, anythingBarbie.

576
00:24:35,182 --> 00:24:37,350
So who are all these people?

577
00:24:37,350 --> 00:24:39,811
- They're people that need help.

578
00:24:39,853 --> 00:24:41,354
- There's a lot of them.

579
00:24:41,354 --> 00:24:43,565
- [Nick] Yeah, there always are.

580
00:24:43,607 --> 00:24:46,151
- [Ashley] So what do you do?

581
00:24:46,985 --> 00:24:48,320
- We help them.

582
00:24:49,237 --> 00:24:50,530
- We?

583
00:24:50,572 --> 00:24:53,033
- You're my assistant now aren'tyou?

584
00:24:53,074 --> 00:24:53,909
- How do you help them?

585
00:24:53,950 --> 00:24:55,368
This stuff costs money.

586
00:24:55,368 --> 00:24:58,121
- Well (groans) I gota little tucked away.

587
00:24:58,163 --> 00:24:59,122
- Have you seen this pile?

588
00:24:59,414 --> 00:25:01,166
It would cost a fortuneto help all these people.

589
00:25:01,208 --> 00:25:02,000
- Yeah.

590
00:25:04,002 --> 00:25:06,505
- Where do you get the money?

591
00:25:07,631 --> 00:25:09,549
You are dealing drugs.

592
00:25:10,675 --> 00:25:12,886
- I'll let you in on a secret.

593
00:25:12,928 --> 00:25:15,347
But you mustn't tell anybody.

594
00:25:15,388 --> 00:25:16,264
- OK.

595
00:25:18,266 --> 00:25:19,226
- I'm rich.

596
00:25:20,310 --> 00:25:21,353
- How rich?

597
00:25:22,270 --> 00:25:23,730
- Filthy.

598
00:25:23,730 --> 00:25:26,483
- If you're so rich, whydo you still live here?

599
00:25:26,525 --> 00:25:27,984
- Well a roof's a roof.

600
00:25:28,026 --> 00:25:29,236
I'm warm I'm dry.

601
00:25:29,236 --> 00:25:30,111
I'm good.

602
00:25:30,153 --> 00:25:31,738
- How did you make your money?

603
00:25:31,780 --> 00:25:34,574
- Well I was a good businessman,

604
00:25:35,408 --> 00:25:37,536
really good at finances.

605
00:25:38,578 --> 00:25:39,871
I'm well enough off.

606
00:25:39,913 --> 00:25:41,456
- Well enough off.

607
00:25:42,374 --> 00:25:45,335
- If I wanted to I couldown a couple of city blocks.

608
00:25:45,377 --> 00:25:46,419
- Then why don't you?

609
00:25:46,419 --> 00:25:47,837
- I don't believe in realestate.

610
00:25:47,879 --> 00:25:50,757
I think people are a betterinvestment.

611
00:25:50,799 --> 00:25:52,300
Which reminds me.

612
00:25:55,053 --> 00:25:57,472
Here's what we're going to dotomorrow.

613
00:25:57,514 --> 00:25:58,640
- So is this what you do?

614
00:25:58,682 --> 00:25:59,933
You find people to help.

615
00:25:59,975 --> 00:26:01,601
- Well things are especiallyhectic

616
00:26:01,601 --> 00:26:03,520
during the Christmas season.

617
00:26:03,561 --> 00:26:06,147
I mean people need help all yearround.

618
00:26:06,189 --> 00:26:10,610
But, during Christmas thingsthat they don't have and need

619
00:26:11,319 --> 00:26:13,530
are much more on their minds.

620
00:26:13,571 --> 00:26:16,449
- So you're like aphilanthropist?

621
00:26:16,491 --> 00:26:19,035
- Well I don't like that label.

622
00:26:19,077 --> 00:26:23,081
This time of year it'ssort of a secret Santa.

623
00:26:27,627 --> 00:26:30,922
- Have you ever done anythingfor me?

624
00:26:33,258 --> 00:26:34,134
Last year.

625
00:26:35,719 --> 00:26:37,262
You gave me Dash.

626
00:26:38,638 --> 00:26:39,806
- Minute I laid eyes on him

627
00:26:39,806 --> 00:26:42,642
I thought he was perfect foryou.

628
00:26:42,684 --> 00:26:44,185
- How did you know?

629
00:26:44,227 --> 00:26:47,439
- Well when you first moved inyou had that little pendant.

630
00:26:47,480 --> 00:26:49,441
You know that doggy.

631
00:26:49,482 --> 00:26:50,275
- [Ashley] Yeah.

632
00:26:50,317 --> 00:26:51,901
- But no dog.

633
00:26:51,943 --> 00:26:54,821
Thought it was a good match.

634
00:26:54,821 --> 00:26:56,656
- Why didn't you tell me?

635
00:26:56,656 --> 00:26:58,450
- Well that would sortof defeat the purpose

636
00:26:58,491 --> 00:27:00,076
of a secret Santa.

637
00:27:02,871 --> 00:27:04,039
Listen to me.

638
00:27:05,332 --> 00:27:07,500
These people need your help.

639
00:27:07,500 --> 00:27:09,586
And I need your help.

640
00:27:09,627 --> 00:27:11,212
Now this is the perfect seasonfor us

641
00:27:11,254 --> 00:27:13,173
to stop thinking about ourselves

642
00:27:13,214 --> 00:27:15,300
and start thinking about others.

643
00:27:15,342 --> 00:27:17,886
- You're asking me toabandon human nature.

644
00:27:17,927 --> 00:27:20,764
- It's a requirement of the job.

645
00:27:21,681 --> 00:27:23,350
- I don't know if I can.

646
00:27:23,391 --> 00:27:24,809
- Well Christmas is three weeksaway.

647
00:27:24,851 --> 00:27:27,562
We'll worry about the can andthe can't when we're done.

648
00:27:27,604 --> 00:27:30,273
(gentle music)

649
00:27:59,886 --> 00:28:02,222
- All right Dash, time to go tobed.

650
00:28:02,263 --> 00:28:05,016
We've got a lot to do tomorrow.

651
00:28:15,235 --> 00:28:16,152
Come on.

652
00:28:29,416 --> 00:28:31,710
OK what are we doing here?

653
00:28:32,836 --> 00:28:35,255
- [Nick] People watching.

654
00:28:35,296 --> 00:28:37,590
- [Ashley] What are we lookingfor?

655
00:28:37,590 --> 00:28:40,927
- [Nick] Well, who are welooking for?

656
00:28:41,928 --> 00:28:43,555
- People in need.

657
00:28:43,596 --> 00:28:44,264
- Yeah.

658
00:28:44,556 --> 00:28:45,765
- But we already have a stack ofnames

659
00:28:45,765 --> 00:28:48,768
of people who need your, ourhelp.

660
00:28:49,686 --> 00:28:52,564
- Well that's just a smallportion.

661
00:28:52,605 --> 00:28:54,566
- There's more?

662
00:28:54,607 --> 00:28:55,525
(Nick chuckles)

663
00:28:55,567 --> 00:28:56,526
- Yep, yep.

664
00:28:58,945 --> 00:29:00,864
Look around you here.

665
00:29:04,909 --> 00:29:07,620
Who do you see that needs help?

666
00:29:13,293 --> 00:29:14,836
- Him?

667
00:29:14,878 --> 00:29:15,753
- Mickey.

668
00:29:16,963 --> 00:29:18,673
Well he's a pretty obviouschoice.

669
00:29:18,715 --> 00:29:21,259
But not a bad place to start.

670
00:29:22,802 --> 00:29:24,596
Who else do you see?

671
00:29:26,639 --> 00:29:28,516
- I don't know.

672
00:29:28,558 --> 00:29:30,894
- Well look around.

673
00:29:30,935 --> 00:29:31,728
Who do you see?

674
00:29:31,769 --> 00:29:34,397
(gentle music)

675
00:29:46,493 --> 00:29:47,952
- Everyone.

676
00:29:47,994 --> 00:29:49,078
- Exactly.

677
00:29:49,120 --> 00:29:53,666
See everyone carriesaround a hurt of some kind.

678
00:29:53,708 --> 00:29:55,585
It may not be as obvious asMickey here.

679
00:29:55,627 --> 00:29:59,798
But everybody needs toknow that somebody cares.

680
00:30:01,633 --> 00:30:04,177
- So you just find them bywatching?

681
00:30:04,177 --> 00:30:05,053
- Mm-hmm.

682
00:30:07,013 --> 00:30:08,932
So who should we help?

683
00:30:10,934 --> 00:30:11,809
Hmm?

684
00:30:15,438 --> 00:30:18,608
- [Mom] Come on honey,hurry up, it's so cold.

685
00:30:18,650 --> 00:30:20,193
- [Boy] But I'm hungry.

686
00:30:20,193 --> 00:30:21,528
- [Mom] I know.

687
00:30:33,039 --> 00:30:35,667
- Can help them both you know.

688
00:30:42,632 --> 00:30:45,468
(cheerful music)

689
00:30:53,101 --> 00:30:55,937
(knocks on door)

690
00:30:58,356 --> 00:31:01,359
(quietly chuckles)

691
00:31:02,527 --> 00:31:03,403
- Mom!

692
00:31:08,741 --> 00:31:10,243
Isn't this great?

693
00:31:11,703 --> 00:31:13,454
- It's wonderful.

694
00:31:13,496 --> 00:31:16,332
Come on help me get this inside.

695
00:31:45,612 --> 00:31:47,905
- So how much money doyou spend doing this?

696
00:31:47,947 --> 00:31:49,907
- Oh I don't keep track.

697
00:31:49,949 --> 00:31:51,075
- You don't keep track?

698
00:31:51,117 --> 00:31:54,037
- No, that would defeat thepurpose.

699
00:31:54,078 --> 00:31:55,580
- So all those people I metyesterday

700
00:31:55,622 --> 00:31:57,957
they're like your spies, yourinformants?

701
00:31:57,957 --> 00:32:00,293
- Well, over the years I'vedeveloped a relationship

702
00:32:00,335 --> 00:32:03,254
with a number of trustworthypeople.

703
00:32:03,296 --> 00:32:05,673
They are my eyes and ears.

704
00:32:05,715 --> 00:32:07,300
- And they can keep a secret?

705
00:32:07,300 --> 00:32:08,635
- Yeah.

706
00:32:08,676 --> 00:32:10,637
- You know I'm stillnot sold on this whole,

707
00:32:10,678 --> 00:32:12,972
I love Christmas, aspect of myjob

708
00:32:13,014 --> 00:32:16,559
but I got to admit it's prettycool.

709
00:32:16,601 --> 00:32:18,895
- Pretty satisfying huh?

710
00:32:18,936 --> 00:32:20,980
Yeah, well it's been saidthat if you help someone

711
00:32:21,022 --> 00:32:24,233
you're the one that benefits themost.

712
00:32:24,275 --> 00:32:25,818
- Is that why you do it?

713
00:32:25,860 --> 00:32:28,237
- It's one of the perks.

714
00:32:28,279 --> 00:32:30,990
- But it's so much money.

715
00:32:30,990 --> 00:32:34,160
- Well a good deed doesn'thave to involve money.

716
00:32:34,202 --> 00:32:35,995
I mean you just have to openyour eyes.

717
00:32:36,037 --> 00:32:37,705
Be aware of others.

718
00:32:39,248 --> 00:32:40,833
Take Stan for example.

719
00:32:40,833 --> 00:32:45,254
Do you notice that, somethingdifferent about him?

720
00:32:45,963 --> 00:32:47,173
- [Ashley] I don't know.

721
00:32:47,173 --> 00:32:48,132
- Something's off.

722
00:32:48,174 --> 00:32:50,343
He's not as chipper.

723
00:32:50,343 --> 00:32:51,511
- Like what?

724
00:32:51,511 --> 00:32:52,512
- Bye.

725
00:32:52,512 --> 00:32:54,472
- [Woman] Thanks Stan.

726
00:32:56,683 --> 00:33:00,770
- His son died just aboutthis time last year.

727
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,190
- I didn't even know he had ason.

728
00:33:04,190 --> 00:33:06,401

I'm a fact checker at themagazine.

786
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:21,828

- I live for this stuff.

792
00:35:35,341 --> 00:35:36,968
- Mmm, it is good.

793
00:35:38,427 --> 00:35:41,639
It's not really hot forthree-alarm chili.

794
00:35:41,681 --> 00:35:43,391
- Give it some time.

795
00:35:44,517 --> 00:35:46,811
- So how do you know Nick?

796
00:35:46,853 --> 00:35:49,689

It's just I get curious.

800
00:35:54,694 --> 00:35:56,404
And, it's just that.

801
00:35:58,030 --> 00:36:00,324
(coughing)

802
00:36:01,951 --> 00:36:03,369
Holy cow this is hot.

00:36:12,044 --> 00:36:13,004
- Yeah, no I'm good.

809
00:36:13,045 --> 00:36:15,089
It's good chili though.

810
00:36:17,717 --> 00:36:18,718
I'm gonna be honest with you,

811
00:36:19,010 --> 00:36:21,220
next time I'm totallyordering something different.

812
00:36:21,220 --> 00:36:24,849
- Three-alarm chili, youdidn't think it would be hot?

813
00:36:24,891 --> 00:36:27,894
- Good you thought you'dobject to a next time.

814
00:36:27,894 --> 00:36:31,689
Maybe do something later thisweek?

815
00:36:31,731 --> 00:36:32,565
- Sure.

816
00:36:33,399 --> 00:36:35,234
- Good I'd like that.

817
00:36:35,276 --> 00:36:38,070

818
00:36:38,070 --> 00:36:38,988

- Ashley, you work for Nick.

822
00:36:44,243 --> 00:36:45,661
- Well just some odd jobs.

823
00:36:45,703 --> 00:36:48,206
It's harder for me toget around these days.

824
00:36:48,247 --> 00:36:49,332
- OK.- Excuse me.

825
00:36:49,373 --> 00:36:51,125

- OK so yeah I thinkthat looks really good.

831
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:13,314
If we could just work on thisone part.

832
00:37:13,356 --> 00:37:14,106
- Hey.

833
00:37:14,148 --> 00:37:15,775
- OK, thanks.

834
00:37:15,775 --> 00:37:18,361
- Ashley and Nick fit together,really?

835
00:37:18,402 --> 00:37:19,570
- You know what?

836
00:37:19,612 --> 00:37:20,279
I'm busy.

837
00:37:20,488 --> 00:37:21,739
- I'm not going to give up onthis.

838
00:37:21,781 --> 00:37:23,616
- Why do you need to know?

839
00:37:23,658 --> 00:37:25,117
- It's Nick Anderson.

840
00:37:25,117 --> 00:37:28,454
He's a legend in my bookand at this magazine.

841
00:37:28,496 --> 00:37:31,958
Him and Ashley are ontosomething.

842
00:37:31,958 --> 00:37:32,959
- It's none of your business.

843
00:37:33,000 --> 00:37:33,709
- Francine.

844
00:37:33,960 --> 00:37:36,629
- No, Will, please just backoff.

845
00:37:41,968 --> 00:37:44,637
- Oh you never told me how yourdate went.

846
00:37:44,637 --> 00:37:45,513
- What's to tell?

847
00:37:45,721 --> 00:37:47,515
We met at the dinner, both hadthe chili.

848
00:37:47,556 --> 00:37:49,934
He nearly burned his face off.

849
00:37:49,976 --> 00:37:50,977
We went our separate ways.

850
00:37:50,977 --> 00:37:53,521
- Yeah you going out again?

851
00:37:53,562 --> 00:37:55,273
- We don't have anythingactually set up

852
00:37:55,314 --> 00:37:57,566
but probably won't happen.

853
00:37:57,608 --> 00:37:59,986
- And you want it to?

854
00:37:59,986 --> 00:38:00,861
- Maybe.

855
00:38:05,032 --> 00:38:07,618
- Seems it was easierto find someone special

856
00:38:07,660 --> 00:38:09,453
when I was your age.

857
00:38:09,495 --> 00:38:10,955
- I'm sure it was always hard.

858
00:38:10,997 --> 00:38:12,331
- Well that's true.

859
00:38:12,373 --> 00:38:13,749
But with all the distractions

860
00:38:13,791 --> 00:38:17,628
it's easy to forgetwhat's really important.

861
00:38:26,053 --> 00:38:27,430
- Heya Nick.

862
00:38:27,471 --> 00:38:28,514
- Merry Christmas, Harry.

863
00:38:28,556 --> 00:38:30,474
Hope this will hold you for awhile.

864
00:38:30,516 --> 00:38:31,809
- Oh sure will.

865
00:38:33,311 --> 00:38:35,771
Hey, you stay put, it gets icyout here.

866
00:38:35,813 --> 00:38:37,982
We'll get it.- All right.

867
00:38:39,150 --> 00:38:40,026
- How are you?

868
00:38:40,026 --> 00:38:42,486
(soft music)

869
00:38:57,585 --> 00:38:59,211
(knocking)

870
00:38:59,211 --> 00:39:01,213
- The GE Story check out?

871
00:39:01,255 --> 00:39:02,131
- Yeah.

872
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,216
That's not why I'm here.

873
00:39:04,258 --> 00:39:05,551
- Apologizing?

874
00:39:05,551 --> 00:39:08,220
- Well if apologizing, youmean giving you a great story.

875
00:39:08,262 --> 00:39:10,973
- A great story we'll be suedover?

876
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:12,850
- It's inspirational.

877
00:39:14,226 --> 00:39:16,520
I ran into Nick Anderson.

878
00:39:16,562 --> 00:39:17,521
- The CEO of...

879
00:39:17,563 --> 00:39:18,397
- [Will] Yeah.

880
00:39:18,397 --> 00:39:19,732
- OK.

881
00:39:19,774 --> 00:39:20,733
- He's getting into the holidayspirit

882
00:39:20,733 --> 00:39:22,401
by doing some charity work.

883
00:39:22,401 --> 00:39:24,278
- OK not groundbreaking but.

884
00:39:24,320 --> 00:39:26,947
- Secret charity work.

885
00:39:26,989 --> 00:39:28,741
- Let me see the story.

886
00:39:28,783 --> 00:39:30,409
- I haven't written it yet.

887
00:39:30,409 --> 00:39:34,580
I wanted to make sure thatif I did, you'd consider it.

888
00:39:34,580 --> 00:39:38,292
And possibly get meoff fact checking duty?

889
00:39:38,334 --> 00:39:40,169
- No promises.

890
00:39:40,211 --> 00:39:41,087
- Good.

891
00:39:45,257 --> 00:39:46,092
- Francine.

892
00:39:46,092 --> 00:39:46,967
- Yes.

893
00:39:47,259 --> 00:39:48,552
- Will's onto a storyabout Nick Anderson now.

894
00:39:48,594 --> 00:39:49,678
I know he's retired or whatever

895
00:39:49,887 --> 00:39:53,599
but make sure Will doesn'tstep on any toes, legally.

896
00:39:53,641 --> 00:39:54,558
- Will do.

897
00:40:00,022 --> 00:40:02,400
- I can't believe howmany people need help.

898
00:40:02,441 --> 00:40:03,776
- [Nick] Yeah.

899
00:40:03,818 --> 00:40:05,903
- Sacred Heart was almost out offood.

900
00:40:05,945 --> 00:40:08,114
- Yeah, well it's notgood news for a shelter,

901
00:40:08,114 --> 00:40:09,990
especially this time of year.

902
00:40:10,032 --> 00:40:11,951
- Does it happen a lot?

903
00:40:11,992 --> 00:40:13,452
- More then you think.

904
00:40:13,494 --> 00:40:16,664
But they're never completely outof food.

905
00:40:16,705 --> 00:40:18,499
- You wouldn't let it happen?

906
00:40:18,541 --> 00:40:19,416
- No.

907
00:40:20,292 --> 00:40:21,669
(beeps)

908
00:40:21,710 --> 00:40:23,170
- [Francine] Nick it's Francine,

909
00:40:23,212 --> 00:40:25,005
look, I think we may have aproblem.

910
00:40:25,047 --> 00:40:27,383
Nothing legal, everything'sset for your trust,

911
00:40:27,425 --> 00:40:29,844
but one of the reporter'shere, Will Price,

912
00:40:29,885 --> 00:40:31,595
is writing something about you.

913
00:40:31,637 --> 00:40:34,181
And I think he has inklingabout your little project.

914
00:40:34,223 --> 00:40:35,724
I know you're particular aboutthis,

915
00:40:35,766 --> 00:40:38,394
so give me a call, I'll see whatI can do.

916
00:40:38,436 --> 00:40:39,395
- Oh goody.

917
00:40:40,813 --> 00:40:42,523
Nick, I'm so sorry.

918
00:40:43,691 --> 00:40:44,942
- Don't worry.

919
00:40:48,154 --> 00:40:49,363
- You used me.

920
00:40:50,281 --> 00:40:51,073
- Ashley.

921
00:40:51,115 --> 00:40:52,241
- You used me to get to Nick

922
00:40:52,283 --> 00:40:54,994
and now you're gonna ruin whathe's doing.

923
00:40:54,994 --> 00:40:55,828
- Ruin?

924
00:40:56,537 --> 00:40:58,789
This is a great storyit deserves to be seen.

925
00:40:58,831 --> 00:41:00,332
- That's not what he wants.

926
00:41:00,374 --> 00:41:01,167
- Why not?

927
00:41:01,167 --> 00:41:02,168
- I don't know.

928
00:41:02,460 --> 00:41:05,171
But Nick has a right to keepit quiet if he wants to.

929
00:41:05,212 --> 00:41:06,839
- I just put the piecestogether.

930
00:41:06,839 --> 00:41:09,008
It's not as if I sought thisout.

931
00:41:09,049 --> 00:41:10,593
But I'm not gonna ignore iteither.

932
00:41:10,634 --> 00:41:13,012
- You didn't look for it, yousure?

933
00:41:13,012 --> 00:41:16,223
Then why did you tell meyou were a fact checker?

934
00:41:16,265 --> 00:41:17,558
You lied to me.

935
00:41:18,559 --> 00:41:20,102
- I kept things to myself.

936
00:41:20,144 --> 00:41:20,895
So did you.

937
00:41:20,936 --> 00:41:22,271
- To protect what he's doing.

938
00:41:22,313 --> 00:41:24,356
- You're acting like this is abad thing.

939
00:41:24,398 --> 00:41:26,901
This is a great story.

940
00:41:26,942 --> 00:41:27,943
It's Christmas.

941
00:41:28,235 --> 00:41:30,613
I mean what better story canI write during Christmastime?

942
00:41:30,654 --> 00:41:32,031
- It's not about Christmas.

943
00:41:32,031 --> 00:41:32,990
It's about him.

944
00:41:33,240 --> 00:41:35,034
Nick is the most selflessperson I have ever met

945
00:41:35,034 --> 00:41:36,911
and he trusted me with hissecret.

946
00:41:36,952 --> 00:41:38,370
And now through some sicktwisted fate

947
00:41:38,412 --> 00:41:39,872
you get a hold of my cell phone.

948
00:41:39,872 --> 00:41:42,458
And everything's gonnabe exposed because of me.

949
00:41:42,500 --> 00:41:43,375
- Ashley wait.

950
00:41:43,417 --> 00:41:44,543
- You're a real jerk you knowthat?

951
00:41:44,585 --> 00:41:45,878
- Yeah I get that a lot.

952
00:41:45,878 --> 00:41:48,714
Listen if you wouldjust let me talk to Nick

953
00:41:48,756 --> 00:41:50,049
he will understand.

954
00:41:50,049 --> 00:41:52,051
- I can't believe I startedliking you.

955
00:41:52,051 --> 00:41:53,928
I really thought youwere interested in me.

956
00:41:53,969 --> 00:41:55,095
- I am interested in you.

957
00:41:55,137 --> 00:41:57,389
- You are more interested in thestory.

958
00:41:57,389 --> 00:41:59,433
- Can I not be interested inboth?

959
00:41:59,475 --> 00:42:00,518
- No.

960
00:42:00,559 --> 00:42:02,519
Because if you were interestedin me,

961
00:42:02,561 --> 00:42:06,523
you'd see why youshouldn't write this story.

962
00:42:11,362 --> 00:42:14,114
(sighs)

963
00:42:14,156 --> 00:42:16,659
(knocking)

964
00:42:16,700 --> 00:42:17,534
Nick.

965
00:42:21,705 --> 00:42:23,999
(knocking)

966
00:42:24,041 --> 00:42:24,875
Nick.

967
00:42:30,381 --> 00:42:31,257
Nick.

968
00:42:34,677 --> 00:42:35,552
Nick!

969
00:42:40,140 --> 00:42:41,559
(solemn music)

970
00:42:41,600 --> 00:42:42,851
- Ms. Matthews.

971
00:42:42,893 --> 00:42:43,561
- Yeah?

972
00:42:43,769 --> 00:42:44,687
- You're here with NickAnderson?

973
00:42:44,728 --> 00:42:45,604
- Yes, yeah.

974
00:42:45,896 --> 00:42:47,898
- He's stable and he askedme to come talk to you

975
00:42:47,940 --> 00:42:49,567
about his condition.

976
00:42:49,608 --> 00:42:51,735
Why don't we have a seat?

977
00:42:51,777 --> 00:42:52,611
- OK.

978
00:42:54,697 --> 00:42:57,449
- His condition has becomea little bit more grave

979
00:42:57,491 --> 00:42:59,910
since last time he was here.

980
00:42:59,952 --> 00:43:03,122
The cancer which has beenin remission at this point

981
00:43:03,122 --> 00:43:05,040
has returned and is starting toprogress.

982
00:43:05,082 --> 00:43:08,752
And it's holding up throughsome of his vital systems.

983
00:43:08,794 --> 00:43:11,422
(solemn music)

984
00:43:34,903 --> 00:43:38,365
(heart monitor beeping)

985
00:43:53,422 --> 00:43:54,965
- Hey I know you.

986
00:43:55,883 --> 00:43:57,801
- Nick you scared me.

987
00:43:58,635 --> 00:44:00,220
- I scared me too.

988
00:44:02,014 --> 00:44:03,932
You talk to my friend?

989
00:44:04,975 --> 00:44:07,644
- Yeah, you can beat cancer,Nick,

990
00:44:07,686 --> 00:44:09,396
people do it all the time.

991
00:44:09,438 --> 00:44:12,358
- Well I beat it twice already.

992
00:44:12,358 --> 00:44:15,235
Somehow I don't thinkthe third times a charm.

993
00:44:15,277 --> 00:44:19,490
- No, you can afford the besttreatment.

994
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,742
- I've had the best treatment.

995
00:44:21,784 --> 00:44:23,494
Cancer's back, I don't think mybody's

996
00:44:23,535 --> 00:44:25,746
gonna fight it this time.

997
00:44:29,124 --> 00:44:31,335
- Why didn't you tell me?

998
00:44:32,878 --> 00:44:35,422
- I didn't want to worry you.

999
00:44:36,382 --> 00:44:38,675
- What about secret Santa?

1000
00:44:41,261 --> 00:44:42,888
- It's yours.

1001
00:44:42,888 --> 00:44:43,555
- What?

1002
00:44:43,764 --> 00:44:46,225
- Yeah, you're gonna take over.

1003
00:44:46,225 --> 00:44:48,352
- No, no, no, I can't.

1004
00:44:48,394 --> 00:44:49,645
- Yeah you can.

1005
00:44:50,312 --> 00:44:52,356
Francine has drawn up all thedocuments

1006
00:44:52,398 --> 00:44:54,733
that you'll need to manage it.

1007
00:44:54,733 --> 00:44:57,361
- Francine, from the magazine?

1008
00:44:59,405 --> 00:45:01,532
- She's my attorney too.

1009
00:45:02,491 --> 00:45:05,369
- You've been planning this.

1010
00:45:05,411 --> 00:45:09,373
- Well, I knew I had topass it onto someone.

1011
00:45:10,916 --> 00:45:11,834
You're it.

1012
00:45:13,377 --> 00:45:15,671
- I don't even know where Iwould start.

1013
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:16,547
- Start.

1014
00:45:18,632 --> 00:45:20,050
You're doing it.

1015
00:45:20,926 --> 00:45:21,802
Huh?

1016
00:45:24,012 --> 00:45:27,599
By the way there's a guy in thenext room

1017
00:45:27,599 --> 00:45:29,435
who's having troublewith his hospital bills

1018
00:45:29,435 --> 00:45:32,271
I want you to check it out forme.

1019
00:45:32,312 --> 00:45:33,105
OK?

1020
00:45:34,857 --> 00:45:35,733
- OK.

1021
00:45:37,484 --> 00:45:39,987
(soft music)

1022
00:46:18,942 --> 00:46:22,404
(heart monitor beeping)

1023
00:46:27,868 --> 00:46:31,663
- I ever tell you whyI started doing this?

1024
00:46:34,791 --> 00:46:39,213
You know, several years agoI was a different person.

1025
00:46:41,673 --> 00:46:44,718
I was, I was real good withmoney.

1026
00:46:47,721 --> 00:46:48,931
Great with finances.

1027
00:46:48,972 --> 00:46:52,976
I had a beautiful wifewho loved me very much.

1028
00:46:56,021 --> 00:46:59,817
I guess I didn't know how tolove her.

1029
00:46:59,858 --> 00:47:02,986
My true love was chasing thedollar.

1030
00:47:04,363 --> 00:47:07,366
And I gave her everything shedesired,

1031
00:47:07,407 --> 00:47:10,494
I thought, or she wanted orneeded.

1032
00:47:11,245 --> 00:47:14,289
Wasn't enough to keep us happy.

1033
00:47:14,331 --> 00:47:15,874
And then she left.

1034
00:47:17,125 --> 00:47:18,544
And I was angry.

1035
00:47:20,587 --> 00:47:25,217
I made sure she didn't geta dime in the settlement.

1036
00:47:25,217 --> 00:47:27,678
I figured I didn't need her.

1037
00:47:28,846 --> 00:47:32,849
A few years went by andI was still the same.

1038
00:47:33,934 --> 00:47:38,355
Then I got a letter thatsaid that she passed away.

1039
00:47:40,399 --> 00:47:44,862
She was the one person wholoved me in spite of who I was.

1040
00:47:47,906 --> 00:47:50,492
I mean I felt empty for years

1041
00:47:50,534 --> 00:47:54,454
but after my wife diedI felt useless, alone.

1042
00:47:58,750 --> 00:48:00,294
So, I quit my job

1043
00:48:01,253 --> 00:48:05,424
and gave away all the stuffI didn't think I needed,

1044
00:48:05,465 --> 00:48:08,552
which was practicallyeverything.

1045
00:48:08,594 --> 00:48:12,931
Eventually I decided thatthis what I should be doing.

1046
00:48:14,266 --> 00:48:17,894
And that's why I wantyou to continue the work.

1047
00:48:17,936 --> 00:48:22,774
Because I don't want you toever feel empty or useless.

1048
00:48:22,774 --> 00:48:26,361
And I certainly don'twant you to feel alone.

1049
00:48:26,403 --> 00:48:29,448
- Stop talking like you'redying.

1050
00:48:29,448 --> 00:48:30,532
- Denial doesn't help, honey.

1051
00:48:30,782 --> 00:48:35,037
I just wanna make sure thatyou're gonna be all right.

1052
00:48:35,787 --> 00:48:39,041
- Nick promise me you'll stillfight.

1053
00:48:40,250 --> 00:48:41,835
- Don't be afraid.

1054
00:48:45,005 --> 00:48:47,841
Why don't you go get some sleep?

1055
00:48:52,220 --> 00:48:52,971
(knocks)

1056
00:48:53,013 --> 00:48:53,805
- Francine.

1057
00:48:53,847 --> 00:48:54,640
- What?

1058
00:48:54,848 --> 00:48:56,308
- You think Nick would do aninterview.

1059
00:48:56,308 --> 00:48:57,225
- No.

1060
00:48:57,267 --> 00:48:59,603
- Not even a one-on-oneinterview.

1061
00:48:59,645 --> 00:49:01,104
Could be good PR.

1062
00:49:01,938 --> 00:49:03,732
- He doesn't do it for the PR.

1063
00:49:03,774 --> 00:49:06,485
Besides with him being inthe hospital right now.

1064
00:49:06,485 --> 00:49:08,528
He's got other things on hismind.

1065
00:49:08,570 --> 00:49:09,571
- Hospital?

1066
00:49:10,405 --> 00:49:12,074
- I thought you knew.

1067
00:49:12,115 --> 00:49:14,618
Well just don't skew aroundwith whatever you're writing.

1068
00:49:14,660 --> 00:49:16,036
He's a good man.

1069
00:49:20,499 --> 00:49:23,168
(gentle music)

1070
00:49:30,467 --> 00:49:33,011
(Dash whining)

1071
00:49:33,011 --> 00:49:35,305
(knocking)

1072
00:49:42,938 --> 00:49:45,524
- I heard about Nick.

1073
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:46,400
I'm sorry.

1074
00:49:47,317 --> 00:49:48,193
- Thanks.

1075
00:49:49,444 --> 00:49:50,696
- So what are you up to?

1076
00:49:50,696 --> 00:49:54,199
- Just working, which Ishould probably get back to.

1077
00:49:54,241 --> 00:49:55,534
- So, being Nick's assistant

1078
00:49:55,575 --> 00:49:56,576
does that mean you have to do

1079
00:49:56,618 --> 00:49:59,705
all the Christmas cheer byyourself.

1080
00:49:59,746 --> 00:50:02,374
- Trying not to think aboutthat.

1081
00:50:02,416 --> 00:50:03,709
- Want some help?

1082
00:50:03,709 --> 00:50:06,253
- Why, so you can spy on Nick?

1083
00:50:06,294 --> 00:50:07,337
- Just help.

1084
00:50:14,386 --> 00:50:15,262
- OK.

1085
00:50:21,560 --> 00:50:22,352
- Can I help you?- Hi.

1086
00:50:22,561 --> 00:50:23,520
- So are we getting an earlylunch

1087
00:50:23,562 --> 00:50:25,063
before we start santa-ing?

1088
00:50:25,063 --> 00:50:27,023
- Nope, eat on your own dime.

1089
00:50:27,065 --> 00:50:28,316
- What are you we doing here?

1090
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,068
- I'm just making this up as Igo.

1091
00:50:30,110 --> 00:50:32,904
So, you'll have to wait and see.

1092

There you go.

Of course.

- Thanks hun.

1117
00:51:24,206 --> 00:51:25,916

00:51:26,875 --> 00:51:29,544
- [Will] Good, how are you sir?

1120
00:51:29,586 --> 00:51:30,337
This is for you.

1121
00:51:30,378 --> 00:51:31,922
- Thanks.- Later.

1122
00:51:33,882 --> 00:51:35,842
Ran out of burgers quicker thenI thought.

1123
00:51:35,884 --> 00:51:38,053
- Don't worry there's more todo.

1124
00:51:38,094 --> 00:51:39,638
- Can I go get some more?

1125
00:51:39,638 --> 00:51:40,514
- No.

1126
00:51:41,640 --> 00:51:43,225
Next stop.

1127
00:51:43,266 --> 00:51:44,351
- Toy store.

1128
00:51:44,392 --> 00:51:45,977
I forgot the big red Santa bag.

1129
00:51:45,977 --> 00:51:48,271
- Discretion is importantremember?

1130
00:51:48,313 --> 00:51:49,648
That's why what you're writing

1131
00:51:49,648 --> 00:51:51,525
is so opposite of what Nickwants.

1132
00:51:51,566 --> 00:51:54,402
- Well, let me talk to Nickmyself.

1133
00:51:54,444 --> 00:51:55,821
See what he really wants.

1134
00:51:55,821 --> 00:51:56,613
- Nice try.

1135
00:51:56,655 --> 00:51:59,658
- Yes, yes, I know, I'm evil.

1136
00:51:59,658 --> 00:52:01,034
That Santa's list?

1137
00:52:01,076 --> 00:52:02,661
- Uh yeah, and you're not on it.

1138
00:52:02,661 --> 00:52:04,496
- Oh, neither are you.

1139
00:52:04,538 --> 00:52:05,413
- Grow up.

1140
00:52:06,331 --> 00:52:09,000
- We are in a toy store.

1141
00:52:09,000 --> 00:52:09,918
Cute.

1142
00:52:11,211 --> 00:52:14,089
All right, level with me.

1143
00:52:14,130 --> 00:52:15,006
Where did you get the list?

1144
00:52:15,215 --> 00:52:18,593
- I wrote it based on somehelpful hints.

1145
00:52:18,635 --> 00:52:19,427
- From who, I mean is there like

1146
00:52:19,636 --> 00:52:21,221
a whole network of secretSantas?

1147
00:52:21,263 --> 00:52:22,681
- Are you asking because you'recurious

1148
00:52:22,722 --> 00:52:25,350
or because you wanna write aboutit?

1149
00:52:25,350 --> 00:52:28,562
- We have way more toysthen are on that list.

1150
00:52:28,603 --> 00:52:29,354
- So?

1151
00:52:29,604 --> 00:52:32,858
- So what happens to all theextra toys?

1152
00:52:32,858 --> 00:52:35,819
(Christmas music)

1153
00:52:51,293 --> 00:52:54,170
(cheerful music)

1154
00:52:55,755 --> 00:52:58,008
Being a do-gooder takesa lot of energy, huh?

1155
00:52:58,049 --> 00:52:58,884
- Yeah.

1156
00:52:59,718 --> 00:53:01,469
- Hey can I get you guys anydessert?

1157
00:53:01,511 --> 00:53:04,723
- No thanks, I've gotta getto the hospital to visit Nick.

1158
00:53:04,764 --> 00:53:05,974
- Well listen I want you to tellNick

1159
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:07,309
that I'm thinking about him

1160
00:53:07,350 --> 00:53:09,144
and that he's in my prayers OK.

1161
00:53:09,186 --> 00:53:10,061
You guys have a great night.

1162
00:53:10,061 --> 00:53:11,688
- Thanks, you too.

1163
00:53:16,818 --> 00:53:17,736
What?

1164
00:53:19,070 --> 00:53:21,823
- Oh, just something Nick said.

1165
00:53:23,450 --> 00:53:24,576
- About Stan?

1166
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:28,830
- Yeah he said his son died lastyear

1167
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,540
around Christmas in an accident.

1168
00:53:30,582 --> 00:53:33,084
I just can't stop thinking aboutit.

1169
00:53:33,126 --> 00:53:35,045
- It's gotta be tough.

1170
00:53:36,546 --> 00:53:40,258
- I wanna do somethingbut I don't know what.

1171
00:53:40,300 --> 00:53:44,721
- Yeah, what do you buy thatmakes that pain go away right?

1172
00:53:47,057 --> 00:53:48,725
Something I can do?

1173
00:53:49,768 --> 00:53:50,685
- Depends.

1174
00:53:51,561 --> 00:53:53,772
What do you have in mind?

1175
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:59,277
- I could do some digging,see what I find out.

1176
00:53:59,277 --> 00:54:00,195
- OK.

1177
00:54:04,991 --> 00:54:07,577
(happy music)

1178
00:54:12,374 --> 00:54:15,293
So, what do you reallydo for the magazine?

1179
00:54:15,293 --> 00:54:16,336
- [Will] Really do?

1180
00:54:16,628 --> 00:54:19,965
- [Ashley] Yeah, I know youlied about being a reporter.

1181
00:54:19,965 --> 00:54:21,591
- OK I'm a writer.

1182
00:54:24,511 --> 00:54:27,889
I wrote a story recently about acompany.

1183
00:54:27,931 --> 00:54:29,516
My boss didn't like it.

1184
00:54:29,557 --> 00:54:31,643
Said I took some stuff out ofcontext.

1185
00:54:31,643 --> 00:54:32,560
- Did you?

1186
00:54:34,062 --> 00:54:36,564
- Not enough to get meinto any legal trouble.

1187
00:54:36,606 --> 00:54:38,942
- Oh, you must be so proud.

1188
00:54:39,609 --> 00:54:40,360
- If it makes you feel anybetter

1189
00:54:40,568 --> 00:54:41,903
I am fact checking stories now,

1190
00:54:41,945 --> 00:54:44,781
part of my punishment, whatever.

1191
00:54:45,615 --> 00:54:47,742
So why did Nick pick you?

1192
00:54:47,784 --> 00:54:49,286
- I don't know.

1193
00:54:49,327 --> 00:54:50,578
- Liar.

1194
00:54:50,620 --> 00:54:52,289
- You're the one to talk.

1195
00:54:52,330 --> 00:54:53,164
- Ouch.

1196
00:54:54,124 --> 00:54:56,167
- He wants me to be happy Iguess.

1197
00:54:56,167 --> 00:54:58,086
Especially this time of year.

1198
00:54:58,128 --> 00:54:59,504
- You're not normally?

1199
00:54:59,504 --> 00:55:02,340
- Let's just say Christmasisn't my favorite.

1200
00:55:02,340 --> 00:55:03,508
- Because?

1201
00:55:03,508 --> 00:55:06,845
- OK I don't hate Christmas perse;

1202
00:55:06,845 --> 00:55:11,307
it's just a really hard timeof year for people like me.

1203
00:55:12,684 --> 00:55:14,060
- People like you.

1204
00:55:14,102 --> 00:55:15,854
- OK, I'm going to stop there

1205
00:55:15,854 --> 00:55:17,147
because I'm opening up tosomeone

1206
00:55:17,188 --> 00:55:20,483
I definitely shouldn't beopening up to.

1207
00:55:20,525 --> 00:55:21,776
- And the wall goes up.

1208
00:55:21,818 --> 00:55:23,069
- Excuse me?

1209
00:55:23,111 --> 00:55:24,154
- We haven't known each othervery long

1210
00:55:24,362 --> 00:55:27,157
but I think it's safeto say you avoid people.

1211
00:55:27,198 --> 00:55:28,533
- No I don't.

1212
00:55:28,533 --> 00:55:29,617
- Really?

1213
00:55:29,659 --> 00:55:33,288
You only interact with Nick andyour dog.

1214
00:55:34,331 --> 00:55:35,623
- That's not true.

1215
00:55:35,665 --> 00:55:38,501
- It is OK to talk topeople about your feelings.

1216
00:55:38,543 --> 00:55:40,712
- You don't care about myfeelings.

1217
00:55:40,712 --> 00:55:43,298
You just want a background foryour story.

1218
00:55:43,340 --> 00:55:45,383
- You think I'm asking about astory?

1219
00:55:45,425 --> 00:55:46,217
- Aren't you?

1220
00:55:46,217 --> 00:55:48,762
Mr. I got in trouble at work.

1221
00:55:48,803 --> 00:55:50,430
- Maybe I'm asking because we'refriends.

1222
00:55:50,472 --> 00:55:51,890
- (scoffs) We're not friends.

1223
00:55:51,890 --> 00:55:53,266
- We're not?

1224
00:55:53,308 --> 00:55:53,975
- No.

1225
00:55:54,017 --> 00:55:57,645
- (exhales) Ouch again.

1226
00:55:57,687 --> 00:55:59,689
Ashley wait a second.

1227
00:55:59,731 --> 00:56:02,233
Look, I mean I know women aresupposed to be temperamental

1228
00:56:02,233 --> 00:56:03,735
but I think you're takingthis to the extreme.

1229
00:56:03,735 --> 00:56:04,778
- What?

1230
00:56:04,819 --> 00:56:06,071
- I got you to stop, didn't I?

1231
00:56:06,071 --> 00:56:08,239
- OK, I appreciate your helpWill.

1232
00:56:08,239 --> 00:56:09,407
I really do.

1233
00:56:09,407 --> 00:56:12,077
But I just can't seemto shake this feeling

1234
00:56:12,077 --> 00:56:15,288
that this whole friendshipthing is a complete sham.

1235
00:56:15,330 --> 00:56:18,416
- I volunteered to help youremember?

1236
00:56:18,458 --> 00:56:19,334
I passed out burgers.

1237
00:56:19,376 --> 00:56:20,919
I helped you buy toys.

1238
00:56:20,919 --> 00:56:23,254
Plus I put up with yourlovely personality.

1239
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:24,422
And when I ask you a simplequestion

1240
00:56:24,422 --> 00:56:26,007
why Christmas is such a bigdeal,

1241
00:56:26,049 --> 00:56:27,592
you accuse me of working anangle.

1242
00:56:27,592 --> 00:56:29,594
- Because you are, whyelse would you be here?

1243
00:56:29,594 --> 00:56:30,762
- Because I care about you.

1244
00:56:30,762 --> 00:56:32,055
- No you don't.- Yes I do.

1245
00:56:32,097 --> 00:56:33,473
- No, you don't.

1246
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:43,066
- Huh.

1247
00:56:44,275 --> 00:56:46,027
Left you speechless.

1248
00:56:48,613 --> 00:56:49,531
You OK?

1249
00:56:50,615 --> 00:56:52,283
Did I leave you breathless too?(chuckles)

1250
00:56:52,325 --> 00:56:54,411
- Oh, get over yourself.

1251
00:56:56,037 --> 00:57:00,125
- Well this isn't goingto change anything, right?

1252
00:57:00,125 --> 00:57:02,085
I'll see you tomorrow.

1253
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:08,550
(gentle music)

1254
00:57:09,759 --> 00:57:13,304
- I spoke to Mrs. Hendrixearlier today.

1255
00:57:13,346 --> 00:57:16,474
- Is she ever gonna get aplumber to our apartment?

1256
00:57:16,516 --> 00:57:17,976
- I just found out that Mr.Hendrix

1257
00:57:17,976 --> 00:57:19,477
had a stroke about a month ago

1258
00:57:19,519 --> 00:57:21,062
and she's hardly been to theapartment

1259
00:57:21,104 --> 00:57:23,940
because he's at a care facility.

1260
00:57:25,525 --> 00:57:26,484
- Really?

1261
00:57:26,484 --> 00:57:27,402
- Mm-hmm.

1262
00:57:30,155 --> 00:57:32,282
- You never quit do you?

1263
00:57:33,283 --> 00:57:34,951
- I ain't dead yet.

1264
00:57:36,661 --> 00:57:38,454
So how'd it go today?

1265
00:57:39,831 --> 00:57:40,748
- Um...

1266
00:57:42,375 --> 00:57:45,670
You know, it went pretty good.

1267
00:57:45,712 --> 00:57:47,005
- Pretty good?

1268
00:57:47,005 --> 00:57:47,881
- Mm-hmm.

1269
00:57:49,299 --> 00:57:50,508
I don't know how to tell youthis

1270
00:57:50,508 --> 00:57:52,677
so I'm just gonna say it.

1271
00:57:53,511 --> 00:57:56,514
That reporter you got a phonecall about?

1272
00:57:56,556 --> 00:57:59,350
The one who wants to write astory on you

1273
00:57:59,350 --> 00:58:00,810
and who I accidentally went outwith?

1274
00:58:00,852 --> 00:58:02,270
- [Nick] Mm-hmm.

1275
00:58:03,813 --> 00:58:05,398
- He's helping me.

1276
00:58:11,196 --> 00:58:12,447
- Well that's interesting.

1277
00:58:12,489 --> 00:58:14,866
- I couldn't do it alone.

1278
00:58:14,866 --> 00:58:17,619
And he knows how it works now.

1279
00:58:17,660 --> 00:58:19,913
He wants to interview you.

1280
00:58:22,207 --> 00:58:24,292
(sighs)

1281
00:58:27,545 --> 00:58:28,463
I'm sorry.

1282
00:58:35,720 --> 00:58:37,388
Nick say something.

1283
00:58:38,556 --> 00:58:40,808
- You like him don't you?

1284
00:58:42,602 --> 00:58:43,603
- I do not.

1285
00:58:44,687 --> 00:58:46,981
(chuckles)

1286
00:58:58,743 --> 00:59:00,328
- Indeed the couplecertainly would have died

1287
00:59:00,370 --> 00:59:02,205
if it had not been for theheroic efforts

1288
00:59:02,247 --> 00:59:03,539
of Tom Manning.

1289
00:59:10,004 --> 00:59:12,924
And in the end it provedfatal for Manning.

1290
00:59:12,966 --> 00:59:15,593
(gentle music)

1291
00:59:37,407 --> 00:59:38,741
- Hey Dash, I'll takeyou out in one second

1292
00:59:38,783 --> 00:59:40,118
but I've gotta make a call.

1293
00:59:40,159 --> 00:59:42,787
(gentle music)

1294
01:00:07,854 --> 01:00:09,355
- Mrs. Hendrix.

1295
01:00:09,397 --> 01:00:10,690
- Yes.

1296
01:00:10,732 --> 01:00:12,400
- [Worker] I'll put this in thetruck.

1297
01:00:12,442 --> 01:00:14,610
- So we did everything youasked.

1298
01:00:14,652 --> 01:00:16,237
We fixed the problem with thepipes

1299
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,990
and we replaced all the hotwater heaters.

1300
01:00:19,032 --> 01:00:22,994
All the plumbing seems to bein perfect working order now.

1301
01:00:22,994 --> 01:00:25,413
Is there anything elsethat we can do for you?

1302
01:00:25,455 --> 01:00:26,289
- What?

1303
01:00:28,374 --> 01:00:30,001
I can't pay for this.

1304
01:00:30,001 --> 01:00:34,130
- Oh, everything's alreadybeen taking care of.

1305
01:00:36,591 --> 01:00:39,260
(gentle music)

1306
01:00:43,848 --> 01:00:46,601
(playful music)

1307
01:00:49,896 --> 01:00:53,066
- So do you wanna talk aboutlast night?

1308
01:00:53,107 --> 01:00:54,275
- Mm, no.

1309
01:00:54,317 --> 01:00:56,194
- OK. (clears throat)

1310
01:00:56,235 --> 01:00:58,196
So who's house is this anyways?

1311
01:00:58,196 --> 01:01:01,074
- Oh, it's a little girland her grandmother's.

1312
01:01:01,115 --> 01:01:01,991
I'll be right back.

1313
01:01:02,033 --> 01:01:02,867
- OK.

1314
01:01:26,224 --> 01:01:29,060
(doorbell rings)

1315
01:01:37,276 --> 01:01:38,194
- Grandma.

1316
01:01:41,614 --> 01:01:42,865
What's it say?

1317
01:01:46,327 --> 01:01:50,248
- Dear Rose, I'm awfully busythis year

1318
01:01:50,248 --> 01:01:51,249
and I wanted to make sure

1319
01:01:51,249 --> 01:01:54,585
I didn't forget you andJulianne.

1320
01:01:54,627 --> 01:01:59,590
Toys for your granddaughterand money for your medicines.

1321
01:01:59,590 --> 01:02:02,051
Merry Christmas, love Santa.

1322
01:02:09,058 --> 01:02:11,811
(playful music)

1323
01:02:13,146 --> 01:02:14,188
- You're smooth.

1324
01:02:14,230 --> 01:02:15,857
- Of course I am.

1325
01:02:15,898 --> 01:02:17,275
- You know, you're betterat this secret Santa thing

1326
01:02:17,275 --> 01:02:18,609
than you think.

1327
01:02:18,609 --> 01:02:21,154
Nick, he's taught you well.

1328
01:02:21,195 --> 01:02:22,071
- Thanks.

1329
01:02:23,197 --> 01:02:25,324
- How's he doing anyway?

1330
01:02:27,952 --> 01:02:31,330
- He said you could go see him.

1331
01:02:31,372 --> 01:02:32,540
- That's not what I was gettingat.

1332
01:02:32,582 --> 01:02:34,041
- Sure it wasn't.

1333
01:02:36,544 --> 01:02:38,921
- He said he'd talk with me?

1334
01:02:39,714 --> 01:02:43,134
By the way, how long are yougoing to avoid eye contact?

1335
01:02:43,134 --> 01:02:44,844
- I am not avoiding eye contact.

1336
01:02:44,886 --> 01:02:46,053
- You're avoiding eye contact.

1337
01:02:46,095 --> 01:02:47,513
- I am not.

1338
01:02:47,555 --> 01:02:48,431
- OK.

1339
01:02:49,682 --> 01:02:53,978
Look me in the eye and tellme you're not avoiding me.

1340
01:02:54,020 --> 01:02:54,937
- Fine.

1341
01:02:59,734 --> 01:03:03,488
All right, when do youwant to go see Nick?

1342
01:03:09,911 --> 01:03:12,622
(gentle music)

1343
01:03:14,207 --> 01:03:17,543
- I found some stuff outabout Tom, Stan's son.

1344
01:03:17,585 --> 01:03:20,254
- Please tell me it's not dirt.

1345
01:03:20,296 --> 01:03:22,340
- Want to hear this or not?

1346
01:03:22,340 --> 01:03:23,174
- OK.

1347
01:03:24,008 --> 01:03:27,220
- Last Christmas a car lostcontrol on an icy road.

1348
01:03:27,261 --> 01:03:28,513
Crashed into a lake.

1349
01:03:28,513 --> 01:03:31,140
A young married couple wastrapped inside.

1350
01:03:31,182 --> 01:03:33,684
Tom was driving by jumped intothe water.

1351
01:03:33,726 --> 01:03:38,564
He got the couple out but hedidn't make it back to shore.

1352
01:03:38,606 --> 01:03:40,525
They found him a few days later.

1353
01:03:40,566 --> 01:03:41,484
- Oh Stan.

1354
01:03:42,652 --> 01:03:44,195
How awful for him.

1355
01:03:45,029 --> 01:03:49,450
- I made a copy of the articleif you wanna check it out.

1356
01:03:54,580 --> 01:03:57,500
I thought it would help withStan.

1357
01:03:57,542 --> 01:03:58,543
- Thanks.

1358
01:03:58,584 --> 01:03:59,502
- Yeah.

1359
01:04:01,921 --> 01:04:04,757
(cheerful music)

1360
01:04:06,551 --> 01:04:08,261
- Hey, it's Will isn't it?

1361
01:04:08,302 --> 01:04:09,303
- Yes, yes.

1362
01:04:13,391 --> 01:04:14,684
- Hey girl.

1363
01:04:14,725 --> 01:04:16,227
- How you feeling?

1364
01:04:16,269 --> 01:04:17,228
- Oh great.

1365
01:04:20,773 --> 01:04:24,318
Ashley, would you give us a fewminutes?

1366
01:04:25,444 --> 01:04:26,737
- Are you sure?

1367
01:04:27,572 --> 01:04:29,740
- I can handle him.

1368
01:04:29,740 --> 01:04:30,658
- OK.

1369
01:04:35,079 --> 01:04:36,581
- Have a seat will you, Will?

1370
01:04:36,581 --> 01:04:37,623
- Thank you.

1371
01:04:44,463 --> 01:04:48,593
Um, I'm going to recordthis if you don't mind.

1372
01:04:48,634 --> 01:04:51,429
- How did you find out about me?

1373
01:04:51,429 --> 01:04:53,014
- I'm a reporter.

1374
01:04:53,055 --> 01:04:54,765
I notice things.

1375
01:04:54,765 --> 01:04:55,808
- Oh really?

1376
01:04:56,934 --> 01:04:58,352
- Can I ask you a few questions?

1377
01:04:58,394 --> 01:05:01,355
- I wanna ask you a fewquestions.

1378
01:05:02,773 --> 01:05:03,649
- OK.

1379
01:05:04,650 --> 01:05:06,193
- Where are you from?

1380
01:05:06,235 --> 01:05:07,737
- [Will] Michigan.

1381
01:05:08,446 --> 01:05:10,364
- Where did you go to school?

1382
01:05:10,406 --> 01:05:11,741
- Northwestern.

1383
01:05:12,950 --> 01:05:14,535
- You like writing?

1384
01:05:14,577 --> 01:05:16,120
- I love it.

1385
01:05:16,162 --> 01:05:18,289
- You like Ashley.

1386
01:05:18,289 --> 01:05:20,666
(chuckles)

1387
01:05:20,708 --> 01:05:22,960
- She's a very nice girl.

1388
01:05:23,002 --> 01:05:24,086
- Nice girl?

1389
01:05:25,755 --> 01:05:27,089
She's terrific.

1390
01:05:28,299 --> 01:05:30,134
- She's a little hard-headed.

1391
01:05:30,134 --> 01:05:31,135
- Who isn't?

1392
01:05:32,970 --> 01:05:33,888
- Yeah.

1393
01:05:35,222 --> 01:05:36,223
I like her.

1394
01:05:37,391 --> 01:05:40,394
- Let me tell you something,Will.

1395
01:05:41,395 --> 01:05:45,816
She's had a very differentlife from you and me.

1396
01:05:45,858 --> 01:05:48,486
She's had to fight tooth andnail

1397
01:05:48,527 --> 01:05:52,073
for everything she's everachieved.

1398
01:05:52,114 --> 01:05:56,327
She didn't tell you abouther childhood did she?

1399
01:05:57,370 --> 01:05:59,622
When she was a baby she wasdropped off

1400
01:05:59,664 --> 01:06:01,082
in one of those places.

1401
01:06:01,123 --> 01:06:04,335
She passed around foster carehomes

1402
01:06:04,377 --> 01:06:07,463
from one to another like adishrag.

1403
01:06:10,174 --> 01:06:13,302
She didn't have a normalchildhood.

1404
01:06:15,346 --> 01:06:19,767
Hey, all she's ever wanted wasto be loved unconditionally.

1405
01:06:21,686 --> 01:06:24,355
- That's not easy to come by.

1406
01:06:24,355 --> 01:06:26,315
- It's not impossible.

1407
01:06:27,692 --> 01:06:30,319
See people have let her down.

1408
01:06:32,196 --> 01:06:35,366
It's hard for her to open up.

1409
01:06:35,366 --> 01:06:36,242
- Yeah.

1410
01:06:37,702 --> 01:06:39,870
I picked up on that.

1411
01:06:39,870 --> 01:06:41,288
- Yeah.

1412
01:06:41,330 --> 01:06:42,832
But she likes you.

1413
01:06:43,749 --> 01:06:48,212
Otherwise she wouldn't havelet you in as far as she has.

1414
01:06:50,089 --> 01:06:51,924
- You think so?

1415
01:06:51,966 --> 01:06:52,883
- Oh yeah.

1416
01:06:56,470 --> 01:06:57,346
Yeah.

1417
01:07:00,224 --> 01:07:02,226
- To be honest with you,

1418
01:07:02,268 --> 01:07:05,438
sometimes she won't even look atme.

1419
01:07:06,355 --> 01:07:10,735
- You're not very intuitivefor a reporter are you?

1420
01:07:11,569 --> 01:07:14,363
The reason she won't look at you

1421
01:07:14,405 --> 01:07:18,325
is she's afraid that ifshe does she'll melt.

1422
01:07:22,371 --> 01:07:24,540
(gentle music)

1423
01:07:24,582 --> 01:07:26,041
- It's about time.

1424
01:07:26,083 --> 01:07:27,418
- Yeah, sorry.

1425
01:07:27,418 --> 01:07:29,754
- Did you get everything youwanted?

1426
01:07:29,754 --> 01:07:30,796
- Yeah.

1427
01:07:30,838 --> 01:07:33,382
- I'm gonna go check on Nick.

1428
01:07:43,434 --> 01:07:45,478
- Hey, what are you doing?

1429
01:07:45,519 --> 01:07:48,272
- I just wanna stretch my legshere.

1430
01:07:48,272 --> 01:07:49,273
- Oh, can I help?

1431
01:07:49,273 --> 01:07:51,859
- No, no, don't keep Willwaiting.

1432
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:53,110
- He can wait.

1433
01:07:54,528 --> 01:07:57,198
- How long are you gonna keephim away?

1434

01:08:38,072 --> 01:08:41,075
Before we finalize the Christmasissue.

1451
01:08:41,117 --> 01:08:42,451
- OK, will do.

1452
01:08:42,493 --> 01:08:45,579

1453
01:08:50,167 --> 01:08:52,503
(sighs)

1454
01:08:52,503 --> 01:08:54,964
(soft music)

1455
01:09:30,374 --> 01:09:31,834
(ringing)

1456
01:09:31,876 --> 01:09:33,419
- [Operator] City information.

1457
01:09:33,460 --> 01:09:34,879

- Thanks.

1461
01:09:43,929 --> 01:09:48,267
- Nick Anderson bears asimilarity to Santa himself.

1462
01:09:48,309 --> 01:09:49,185
He's old.

1463
01:09:50,102 --> 01:09:51,145
He's jolly.

1464
01:09:52,396 --> 01:09:56,150
And if it wasn't for the factthat he doesn't have a beard.

1465
01:09:56,192 --> 01:09:58,152
So he's the real deal.

1466
01:10:00,821 --> 01:10:02,239
(sighs)

1467
01:10:02,281 --> 01:10:04,450
(groans)

1468
01:10:17,504 --> 01:10:18,547
That's worse.

1469
01:10:18,589 --> 01:10:21,216
(gentle music)

1470
01:10:42,905 --> 01:10:45,658

01:10:56,794 --> 01:10:57,711
Uh huh.

01:10:59,505 --> 01:11:00,297
(solemn music)

1474
01:11:00,339 --> 01:11:02,424
(sighs)

1475
01:11:03,550 --> 01:11:04,385
When?

1476
01:11:06,804 --> 01:11:07,680
OK.

1477
01:11:08,973 --> 01:11:09,932
Thank you.

1478
01:11:31,662 --> 01:11:33,956
(knocking)

1479
01:11:42,297 --> 01:11:44,425
Um, that's my apartment.

1480
01:11:45,509 --> 01:11:46,468

1481
01:11:46,510 --> 01:11:47,428

- Thanks.

1486
01:12:07,865 --> 01:12:11,869
- [Nick] Dear Ashley, I had ahunch things were going south

1487
01:12:11,910 --> 01:12:13,579
so I thought I'd write something

1488
01:12:13,620 --> 01:12:16,165
before my bucket's been kicked.

1489
01:12:16,206 --> 01:12:20,419
First I want no flashyfuneral or any hoopla.

1490
01:12:20,461 --> 01:12:21,211
I'm dead.

1491
01:12:21,378 --> 01:12:22,921
I won't be around to enjoy theparty

1492
01:12:22,963 --> 01:12:25,674
so don't bother throwing one.

1493
01:12:25,716 --> 01:12:29,636
Second, my attorney willcontact you about my will.

1494
01:12:29,678 --> 01:12:32,181
Since you're the closestthing I've had to a family

1495
01:12:32,222 --> 01:12:34,892
I want you to have it all.

1496
01:12:34,933 --> 01:12:38,228
I hope you'll use it to blessothers.

1497
01:12:38,228 --> 01:12:40,689
And lastly, get over yourself

1498
01:12:40,731 --> 01:12:42,816
and tell Will you love him.

1499
01:12:42,858 --> 01:12:46,487
Remember the heart is aresilient muscle.

1500
01:12:47,529 --> 01:12:50,157
Don't worry about the newsstory.

1501
01:12:50,199 --> 01:12:52,117
If he prints it no biggy.

1502
01:12:52,159 --> 01:12:53,243
It's not like I'm going to write

1503
01:12:53,243 --> 01:12:56,163
an angry letter to the editor.

1504
01:12:56,205 --> 01:12:58,040
I'll miss you terribly whilewe're apart

1505
01:12:58,082 --> 01:13:02,169
but I'm not going to lie, Ihope I see my ex-wife Holly

1506
01:13:02,211 --> 01:13:05,923
and offer her the biggestapology I can.

1507
01:13:05,923 --> 01:13:06,882
I love you.

1508
01:13:07,841 --> 01:13:08,717
Nick.

1509
01:13:13,263 --> 01:13:15,557
(sniffles)

1510
01:13:23,357 --> 01:13:25,901
(soft music)

1511
01:13:42,000 --> 01:13:42,876
- Hey.

1512
01:13:53,720 --> 01:13:54,596

1513
01:13:55,889 --> 01:13:58,934
(sniffling)

1514
01:13:58,976 --> 01:14:00,269
- How is it OK?

1515
01:14:01,979 --> 01:14:02,938
- It's not.

1516
01:14:04,481 --> 01:14:06,775
Just something people say.

1517
01:14:08,360 --> 01:14:10,779
(sniffling)

1518
01:14:13,073 --> 01:14:15,826
I think I can guess how you'reholding up.

1519
01:14:15,868 --> 01:14:17,661
- Why are you here?

1520
01:14:17,703 --> 01:14:21,206
- Thought I could bringyou some Christmas cheer.

1521
01:14:21,248 --> 01:14:24,460
- I've never hated Christmasmore.

1522
01:14:24,501 --> 01:14:28,005

- Well Nick said you didn'thave a very normal childhood so.

1527
01:14:39,766 --> 01:14:42,102
- So you thought sledding?

01:14:43,520 --> 01:14:44,855
- No.

1530
01:14:44,855 --> 01:14:47,608
- Stop complaining and hop on.

without Nick now and my son Tom.

1574

What did it say?

1594
01:17:28,644 --> 01:17:30,604

They had a baby and they namedhim Tom.

1603
01:18:01,051 --> 01:18:02,844

I mean in the big schemeof things its just words

1615
01:18:35,168 --> 01:18:37,712

1617
01:18:43,093 --> 01:18:44,010

1631
01:19:19,045 --> 01:19:21,965
- I just had to make afew last minute changes.

1632
01:19:22,007 --> 01:19:25,594
- You at least got a draft I canlook at?

1633
01:19:29,973 --> 01:19:33,310
Well, it's not what I expected.

1634
01:19:33,351 --> 01:19:34,478
I'll let you know.

1635
01:19:34,478 --> 01:19:35,312
- Thanks.

1636
01:19:35,312 --> 01:19:36,229
- [Bob] Oh.

1637
01:19:36,521 --> 01:19:38,440
And try to make sure thisone won't give Francine

1638
01:19:38,482 --> 01:19:39,983
any more headaches.

1639
01:19:39,983 --> 01:19:40,901
- Yeah.

1640
01:19:44,154 --> 01:19:45,614
- Oh, flowers.

1641
01:19:45,655 --> 01:19:46,448
Who are they from?

1642
01:19:46,490 --> 01:19:47,657
- I don't know.

1643
01:19:47,699 --> 01:19:48,617
Let's see.

1644
01:19:52,078 --> 01:19:54,956
(heartfelt music)

1645
01:20:00,587 --> 01:20:03,423
(cheerful music)

1646
01:20:11,848 --> 01:20:14,142
- All right, Dash, Iknow it's Christmas Eve

1647
01:20:14,184 --> 01:20:15,936
but I won't be long.

1648
01:20:19,439 --> 01:20:20,357
- Aw, you shouldn't have.

1649
01:20:20,357 --> 01:20:21,817
- What are you doing here?

1650
01:20:21,858 --> 01:20:23,151
- I thought I'd spendChristmas Eve with you

1651
01:20:23,193 --> 01:20:23,985
if that's all right.

1652
01:20:24,027 --> 01:20:26,363
- OK, well I'm on my way out.

1653
01:20:26,404 --> 01:20:27,322
- Where to?

1654
01:20:27,364 --> 01:20:28,949
- I will show you.

1655
01:20:32,702 --> 01:20:34,454
- Who does this go to?

1656
01:20:34,496 --> 01:20:37,040
I thought you guys alreadycovered everyone I gave you.

1657
01:20:37,040 --> 01:20:38,208
- It's for you.

1658
01:20:38,208 --> 01:20:39,376
Merry Christmas.

1659
01:20:39,417 --> 01:20:41,002
- Merry Christmas.

1660
01:20:42,212 --> 01:20:43,296
- Thank you.

1661
01:20:44,381 --> 01:20:45,382
You didn't have to.

1662
01:20:45,382 --> 01:20:49,135
- We couldn't have done itwithout you.

1663
01:20:49,177 --> 01:20:50,011
- Merry Christmas.

1664
01:20:50,220 --> 01:20:52,013
- Well thank you, MerryChristmas to you.

1665
01:20:52,055 --> 01:20:53,139
- Merry Christmas.

1666
01:20:53,181 --> 01:20:55,183
- Thanks for coming by.

1667
01:20:57,269 --> 01:20:59,896
(gentle music)

1668
01:21:06,987 --> 01:21:10,407
- I have to admit that waspretty cool.

1669
01:21:11,116 --> 01:21:12,576
I never really thought about itbefore

1670
01:21:12,576 --> 01:21:15,704
but I mean Elves deservepresents too.

1671
01:21:15,745 --> 01:21:19,875
- Yeah Nick taught me thateveryone needs something.

1672
01:21:19,916 --> 01:21:21,334
- Including you.

1673
01:21:22,335 --> 01:21:23,503
(laughs)

1674
01:21:23,545 --> 01:21:24,379
- What's this?

1675
01:21:24,421 --> 01:21:25,255
- Oh.

1676
01:21:26,923 --> 01:21:28,925
Christmas presents.

1677
01:21:28,967 --> 01:21:30,552
I can't wrap.

1678
01:21:30,594 --> 01:21:33,013
But it's what's inside thatcounts.

1679
01:21:33,054 --> 01:21:34,014
- Thank you.

1680
01:21:34,723 --> 01:21:37,767
- You survived your firstChristmas as secret Santa.

1681
01:21:37,809 --> 01:21:41,479
- Yeah first and last for thesecret part.

1682
01:21:42,397 --> 01:21:44,065
- Yeah, about that.

1683
01:21:45,775 --> 01:21:47,777
I wanted to apologize.

1684
01:21:47,777 --> 01:21:48,737
- No don't.

1685
01:21:49,904 --> 01:21:52,365
I should apologize actually.

1686
01:21:53,533 --> 01:21:55,118
- For what?

1687
01:21:55,118 --> 01:21:57,871
- For how I've been treatingyou.

1688
01:21:57,912 --> 01:21:59,664
You've helped me so much

1689
01:21:59,706 --> 01:22:01,374
and no matter what you've done

1690
01:22:01,416 --> 01:22:03,501
even writing that story.

1691
01:22:04,920 --> 01:22:05,795
Thank you.

1692
01:22:06,713 --> 01:22:08,214
- You're welcome.

1693
01:22:09,549 --> 01:22:10,759
Open it.

1694
01:22:10,800 --> 01:22:11,635
- OK.

1695
01:22:14,596 --> 01:22:16,306
- Merry Christmas.

1696
01:22:16,348 --> 01:22:19,142
- (laughs) What's this?

1697
01:22:19,142 --> 01:22:22,938
- It's all my secretSanta tapes and notes.

1698
01:22:24,397 --> 01:22:26,733
I didn't submit the article.

1699
01:22:26,775 --> 01:22:28,109
- What?

1700
01:22:28,151 --> 01:22:30,487
- I knew it was gonna be harderfor you.

1701
01:22:30,487 --> 01:22:31,821
And you were right.

1702
01:22:31,863 --> 01:22:34,074
Nick wouldn't have wanted that.

1703
01:22:34,115 --> 01:22:35,492
As we've been doing this projectof his,

1704
01:22:35,533 --> 01:22:39,496
I realized that Nickwasn't just a secret Santa,

1705
01:22:39,496 --> 01:22:40,372
he was...

1706
01:22:42,457 --> 01:22:44,584
he was more of an angel.

1707
01:22:47,796 --> 01:22:49,214
Christmas Angel.

1708
01:22:52,884 --> 01:22:56,846
And being an angel isn'tabout the recognition

1709
01:22:56,846 --> 01:22:58,682
or getting the glory.

1710
01:23:00,892 --> 01:23:03,186
It's about helping others.

1711
01:23:04,437 --> 01:23:08,316
- But, I thought youwere writing something?

1712
01:23:11,569 --> 01:23:14,197
(gentle music)

1713
01:23:39,055 --> 01:23:41,391
(sniffles)

1714
01:23:54,070 --> 01:23:55,447
- [Will] One Christmas down.

01:23:55,488 --> 01:23:58,074

1716
01:23:58,074 --> 01:23:59,826

1717
01:23:59,868 --> 01:24:03,329

1718
01:24:04,205 --> 01:24:06,666
- [Will] You know I was an elfonce?

1719
01:24:06,708 --> 01:24:07,500
- What?

1720
01:24:08,293 --> 01:24:10,587
- Yeah when I was 16,I was short for my age

1721
01:24:10,628 --> 01:24:14,132
and the mall needed helpwith their Santa display.

1722
01:24:14,174 --> 01:24:14,924
So.

1723
01:24:14,924 --> 01:24:16,801
- You were not an elf.

1724
01:24:17,594 --> 01:24:22,056
- All right, I might havestretched the truth there a bit.

1725
01:24:23,016 --> 01:24:27,437
The point is, I canhelp, you know next year.

1726
01:24:27,437 --> 01:24:29,105
- [Ashley] How do youknow what you'll be doing?

1727
01:24:29,147 --> 01:24:33,610
I mean you might be coveringsome big breaking news story.

1728
01:24:33,610 --> 01:24:37,864
- I can make myselfavailable if you want me to.

1729
01:24:38,615 --> 01:24:40,575
- Just Christmas?

1730
01:24:40,617 --> 01:24:42,285
I don't get to see you tillthen?

1731
01:24:42,285 --> 01:24:45,288
- No, that is not going to workeither.

1732

I mean the way I seeit Christmas, crucial.

1733

But people need help therest of the year too.

1734
01:24:52,003 --> 01:24:55,090
- You know I think I can handleit.

1735
01:24:57,675 --> 01:25:00,720
Then again those presentsget really heavy.

1736
01:25:00,762 --> 01:25:03,556
