1
00:00:38,806 --> 00:00:39,772
- Here we go.

2
00:00:39,774 --> 00:00:41,172
- I feel like a TV presenter.

3
00:00:41,174 --> 00:00:43,308
Here are the keys for
our brand new house.

4
00:00:46,413 --> 00:00:48,014
Thank you.

5
00:00:49,517 --> 00:00:51,653
Both of you taking your first
steps into your new home.

6
00:00:53,487 --> 00:00:57,257
Our little boy, what
we gonna call it?

7
00:00:58,526 --> 00:00:59,659
- Joe.

8
00:01:00,828 --> 00:01:01,896
- Little Joe.

9
00:01:12,707 --> 00:01:15,508
- You're lucky, a lot of my
Mum's are already extracting

10
00:01:15,510 --> 00:01:17,275
at this stage.

11
00:01:17,277 --> 00:01:19,514
- Yeah, I just wondered
if it was normal.

12
00:01:21,816 --> 00:01:23,350
- Is it causing any discomfort?

13
00:01:24,217 --> 00:01:25,985
- Yeah, a little bit, yeah.

14
00:01:25,987 --> 00:01:27,252
It's bit sore.

15
00:01:27,254 --> 00:01:29,624
- It's a huge part of
the bonding process

16
00:01:30,725 --> 00:01:32,594
But if you don't feel capable.

17
00:01:35,930 --> 00:01:37,763
- Here we go then.

18
00:01:37,765 --> 00:01:42,535
Right, who's is one sugar?

19
00:01:42,537 --> 00:01:43,337
- Me.

20
00:01:44,471 --> 00:01:45,272
- Sorry.

21
00:01:46,674 --> 00:01:47,474
- There you go.

22
00:01:51,779 --> 00:01:52,981
everything alright?

23
00:01:54,448 --> 00:01:56,851
- His weight isn't coming up
as quickly as I'd like it to.

24
00:01:57,752 --> 00:01:59,317
- How come?

25
00:01:59,319 --> 00:02:01,721
All he does is eat, night
and day isn't it love?

26
00:02:01,723 --> 00:02:04,790
- That's the thing, he
doesn't even sick up either.

27
00:02:04,792 --> 00:02:07,660
He screams every time
like I take him off.

28
00:02:07,662 --> 00:02:09,329
Just constant screaming.

29
00:02:10,798 --> 00:02:11,931
- Ain't the happiest
baby, is he?

30
00:02:11,933 --> 00:02:13,131
- No.

31
00:02:13,133 --> 00:02:14,702
- My sister's two,
all they do is giggle.

32
00:02:18,006 --> 00:02:19,540
- He has a healthy appetite.

33
00:02:20,708 --> 00:02:23,077
Your priority should
be to indulge it.

34
00:02:47,001 --> 00:02:49,167
He has a
healthy appetite.

35
00:02:49,169 --> 00:02:53,539
It's a huge part of
bonding, you're lucky.

36
00:02:53,541 --> 00:02:55,306
Natural part of the
bonding process,

37
00:02:55,308 --> 00:02:56,410
he has a healthy appetite,

38
00:02:57,879 --> 00:02:59,681
you should indulge it.

39
00:03:09,857 --> 00:03:10,692
- Joe.

40
00:03:11,959 --> 00:03:14,694
- You need to take
care of yourself love.

41
00:03:14,696 --> 00:03:16,896
- What and the
house as well, yeah?

42
00:03:16,898 --> 00:03:19,431
- Splash of makeup
and your hair done,

43
00:03:19,433 --> 00:03:22,001
it can do wonders.

44
00:03:22,003 --> 00:03:24,038
- Joe, can you come
and see your nan?

45
00:03:25,973 --> 00:03:28,373
- I suppose Craig's
busy again, is he?

46
00:03:28,375 --> 00:03:29,409
- Mum, don't.

47
00:03:33,748 --> 00:03:35,948
- But I just think.
- Mum!

48
00:03:35,950 --> 00:03:37,518
Can we just not.

49
00:03:38,586 --> 00:03:39,419
Joe!

50
00:03:46,160 --> 00:03:50,064
- Sorry, I didn't realize it
was such a touchy subject.

51
00:03:53,433 --> 00:03:55,737
- I've told you, that
is not for eating.

52
00:03:57,672 --> 00:04:00,005
- Bless him, he's starving.

53
00:04:00,007 --> 00:04:01,843
- He's not starving, he
eats like a fucking pig.

54
00:04:03,044 --> 00:04:07,481
- Laura, how can
you be so cruel?

55
00:04:08,983 --> 00:04:11,451
Come and sit with ya nanny.

56
00:04:13,054 --> 00:04:14,421
- I'll be back at five.

57
00:04:24,766 --> 00:04:29,771
I was thinking some sort
of like parasite maybe,

58
00:04:30,370 --> 00:04:31,739
or worms.

59
00:04:33,641 --> 00:04:38,144
- The blood tests say no,
his weight is fine too.

60
00:04:38,146 --> 00:04:40,546
He's a growing boy,
growing boys eat.

61
00:04:40,548 --> 00:04:44,252
- Yeah, it's just not quite
as straightforward as that.

62
00:04:48,689 --> 00:04:50,158
- Let's talk about you,

63
00:04:54,996 --> 00:04:56,228
Laura.

64
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:57,763
- Yeah, I'm fine,

65
00:04:57,765 --> 00:05:01,334
I just really need to know
what's wrong with my son.

66
00:05:03,805 --> 00:05:05,037
- I can assure you.

67
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:06,939
- Well, I can assure
you that he eats.

68
00:05:06,941 --> 00:05:10,543
He eats and he eats
and he never stops.

69
00:05:11,779 --> 00:05:13,581
Please, why won't you
people just listen.

70
00:05:16,651 --> 00:05:18,451
- We'll see you
again in six months.

71
00:05:56,624 --> 00:05:58,591
- We feel that there are issues

72
00:05:58,593 --> 00:06:01,295
around malnourishment
and neglect.

73
00:06:02,663 --> 00:06:05,900
We have a duty of care to
inform the relevant authorities.

74
00:06:10,470 --> 00:06:12,106
Is Mr. Gilligan joining us?

75
00:06:14,342 --> 00:06:15,176
- No.

76
00:06:28,623 --> 00:06:33,527
- There are also concerns
around Joe's, his--

77
00:06:35,263 --> 00:06:39,367
- You can say it, he stinks.

78
00:06:41,002 --> 00:06:42,169
- His hygiene.

79
00:06:43,104 --> 00:06:46,107
- He baths every day

80
00:06:47,708 --> 00:06:50,177
and he stinks

81
00:06:51,312 --> 00:06:52,445
the moment he gets out,

82
00:06:53,547 --> 00:06:55,981
I actually can't stomach
it myself anymore.

83
00:07:52,073 --> 00:07:53,407
- Just sit still.

84
00:08:15,429 --> 00:08:16,263
Please.

85
00:08:33,047 --> 00:08:35,316
Excuse me, can you get off.

86
00:08:37,685 --> 00:08:40,921
Normal, you call that normal?

87
00:08:42,456 --> 00:08:44,490
That's one day's worth.

88
00:08:44,492 --> 00:08:48,162
One day, I'll see
you in six months.

89
00:11:03,063 --> 00:11:07,168
- Stop being such a
, just do it.

90
00:11:14,909 --> 00:11:16,645
Don't be a pussy, go.

91
00:11:22,483 --> 00:11:24,318
Just do it.

92
00:11:40,901 --> 00:11:41,833
- Come on!

93
00:11:43,437 --> 00:11:48,409
Hungry Joe, hungry Joe,
hungry Joe, hungry Joe.

94
00:12:30,484 --> 00:12:31,885
- I love you Mum.

95
00:12:42,930 --> 00:12:44,331
- Sorry.

96
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,858
- Where
do you want these love?

97
00:22:05,860 --> 00:22:06,826
- In the
bathroom please.

98
00:22:06,828 --> 00:22:07,995
Thank you.

99
00:47:38,626 --> 00:47:39,559
- I just don't think

100
00:47:39,561 --> 00:47:41,527
I can do this right now Jane,

101
00:47:41,529 --> 00:47:42,961
I don't think we
should be together.

102
00:47:42,963 --> 00:47:45,397
I know what I said but
I just don't think.

103
00:47:45,399 --> 00:47:48,166
I'm just not in a good place
to be in a relationship,

104
00:47:48,168 --> 00:47:49,101
I know what I said.

105
00:47:49,103 --> 00:47:52,003
I'm just too busy right now.

106
00:47:55,976 --> 00:47:57,211
I'm sorry Jane.

107
00:50:28,630 --> 00:50:30,128
- Hello, you've
reached Jessica Ross.

108
00:50:30,130 --> 00:50:32,399
I can't get to the phone right
now, so if you could leave--

109
00:50:40,340 --> 00:50:42,109
- Hi, you've
reached Ben Ross.

110
00:51:24,052 --> 00:51:25,283
- Hi, you called
about your water.

111
00:51:25,285 --> 00:51:26,384
What seems to be the problem?

112
00:51:26,386 --> 00:51:28,322
- Hi, yeah, come in.

113
00:51:29,456 --> 00:51:30,690
I tried turning on the water

114
00:51:30,692 --> 00:51:33,025
and it wouldn't turn on
anywhere in the house.

115
00:51:33,027 --> 00:51:36,361
My parents said their bathtub
wasn't draining last week.

116
00:51:36,363 --> 00:51:38,631
I don't know if that has
anything to do with it.

117
00:51:38,633 --> 00:51:40,032
- Probably not, but
I'll check that first.

118
00:51:40,034 --> 00:51:40,967
Where's their room?

119
00:51:40,969 --> 00:51:42,334
- It's the one right there.

120
00:51:42,336 --> 00:51:43,236
- Perfect, thanks.

121
00:51:45,272 --> 00:51:46,271
This will only take a minute.

122
00:51:46,273 --> 00:51:47,374
- Okay, thank you.

123
00:52:48,536 --> 00:52:49,802
- Hello, I'm Levi,

124
00:52:49,804 --> 00:52:51,637
I'm from Blue House
Plumbing Services,

125
00:52:51,639 --> 00:52:52,807
here to check the drain.

126
00:52:54,274 --> 00:52:56,809
- No, someone already
came, he's upstairs.

127
00:52:56,811 --> 00:52:57,877
- That's not right.

128
00:52:57,879 --> 00:52:59,379
I'm the only one they sent out.

129
00:53:01,916 --> 00:53:04,016
- But someone's
already upstairs.

130
00:53:04,018 --> 00:53:05,283
- Can't be from our company.

131
00:53:05,285 --> 00:53:07,320
I'm the only one that
works night shifts.

132
00:53:09,824 --> 00:53:11,191
Did you call another company?

133
00:53:12,994 --> 00:53:14,261
- No, no, just you guys.

134
00:53:15,830 --> 00:53:17,429
- Do you want me
to check upstairs?

135
00:53:17,431 --> 00:53:19,600
Probably just a
misunderstanding.

136
00:53:23,705 --> 00:53:24,539
- Okay.

137
00:53:50,198 --> 00:53:52,033
He went in that room.

138
00:54:06,881 --> 00:54:08,149
- Hello?

139
00:54:13,386 --> 00:54:14,722
- Hello?

140
00:54:26,366 --> 00:54:27,267
no one's here.

141
00:54:45,452 --> 00:54:47,285
- But it wasn't working before.

142
00:54:47,287 --> 00:54:48,954
- Maybe he just
fixed it and left.

143
00:54:48,956 --> 00:54:50,488
- He didn't say
anything to me though.

144
00:54:53,928 --> 00:54:57,029
- Listen, I've got
another house to get to.

145
00:54:57,031 --> 00:54:58,933
It's probably just
a misunderstanding.

146
00:55:00,168 --> 00:55:01,301
- At least it's working.

147
00:55:03,504 --> 00:55:04,637
But wait, he was here.

148
00:55:04,639 --> 00:55:05,905
He walked.

149
00:55:05,907 --> 00:55:07,640
- Probably just fixed
the faucets and left.

150
00:55:07,642 --> 00:55:09,542
Trust me, it happens
all the time.

151
00:55:09,544 --> 00:55:10,645
No one's here anymore.

152
00:55:28,629 --> 00:55:31,098
- Hey, call me if the
water goes out, all right.

153
00:59:46,253 --> 00:59:51,258
- Jane,
Jane, Jane, Jane,

154
00:59:51,725 --> 00:59:54,893
Jane.

155
00:59:54,895 --> 00:59:57,298
Jane, Jane, Jane, Jane,

156
01:00:07,041 --> 01:00:07,875
Jane.

157
01:11:05,066 --> 01:11:06,534
- Who's that?

158
01:11:07,769 --> 01:11:09,436
- Hello?

159
01:11:10,872 --> 01:11:13,271
Da's in the big shed if
you're looking something.

160
01:11:13,273 --> 01:11:15,308
We've no beef left, but
we've pig and chucks.

161
01:11:16,711 --> 01:11:18,309
- Hello.

162
01:11:18,311 --> 01:11:19,912
- There's no beef left.

163
01:11:19,914 --> 01:11:21,680
Only pig and chucks.

164
01:11:21,682 --> 01:11:24,519
Go on over to the big
shed, Da'll sort you out.

165
01:11:26,687 --> 01:11:28,355
- Hello?

166
01:11:35,997 --> 01:11:38,130
- I don't need any beef.

167
01:11:38,132 --> 01:11:41,767
- We have no beef
left, pig and chucks

168
01:11:41,769 --> 01:11:45,171
and maybe a
of eggs, but that's all.

169
01:11:45,173 --> 01:11:46,406
- I don't want any food.

170
01:11:48,109 --> 01:11:49,575
- What do you want?

171
01:11:49,577 --> 01:11:51,746
- I want one thing
and one thing only,

172
01:11:52,647 --> 01:11:54,613
to share the good word.

173
01:11:54,615 --> 01:11:57,082
The word laid down
by our father,

174
01:11:57,084 --> 01:11:59,952
the gospel according to my
Lord and saviour Jesus Christ.

175
01:11:59,954 --> 01:12:00,888
Tell me Mrs.

176
01:12:04,491 --> 01:12:05,858
- Taggart.

177
01:12:05,860 --> 01:12:06,894
- Mrs. Taggart.

178
01:12:08,095 --> 01:12:11,098
Tell me Mrs Taggart,
are you a believer?

179
01:12:12,499 --> 01:12:15,234
Have you accepted the
Lord Jesus as your savior?

180
01:12:15,236 --> 01:12:17,670
- Long ago, but I'm no one

181
01:12:17,672 --> 01:12:19,807
for talking about our
savior on doorsteps.

182
01:12:20,842 --> 01:12:21,876
You better come in.

183
01:12:29,183 --> 01:12:30,450
- Thank you Mrs. Taggart.

184
01:12:35,422 --> 01:12:38,358
- You can call me Ma,
everyone else does.

185
01:12:40,027 --> 01:12:41,694
- And is there a Mr. Taggart?

186
01:12:41,696 --> 01:12:44,362
- Da, he's in the big shed.

187
01:12:44,364 --> 01:12:45,764
- Your father?

188
01:12:45,766 --> 01:12:47,533
- Dear bless us no,

189
01:12:47,535 --> 01:12:51,737
my father's dead this
20 years, my husband,

190
01:12:51,739 --> 01:12:55,107
we've called each other ma and
da since I don't know when.

191
01:12:55,109 --> 01:12:57,442
- My grandparents used
to do the same thing.

192
01:12:57,444 --> 01:13:00,512
- Aye, I suppose it's
old fashioned nowadays.

193
01:13:00,514 --> 01:13:03,448
- Well, sometimes the
old ways are the best.

194
01:13:03,450 --> 01:13:05,651
- That's what I keep saying.

195
01:13:05,653 --> 01:13:08,554
They wanted us to put the
electric here in the house.

196
01:13:08,556 --> 01:13:12,457
But I says no, I'm not having
them wires in my walls.

197
01:13:12,459 --> 01:13:13,928
I stick with my oil lamps.

198
01:13:15,129 --> 01:13:16,998
No one knows what that
electric does to you.

199
01:13:19,767 --> 01:13:21,969
There's wee, Mrs.
Convoy down the road.

200
01:13:23,070 --> 01:13:24,437
She got the electric in.

201
01:13:25,840 --> 01:13:28,075
Next thing you know, she
has the cancer in her tits.

202
01:13:28,943 --> 01:13:30,142
- Get away with you.

203
01:13:30,144 --> 01:13:32,713
- I'm telling you,
been buried a year now.

204
01:13:34,148 --> 01:13:36,582
- Well, I hope she
knew the Lord Jesus.

205
01:13:36,584 --> 01:13:37,417
- She did.

206
01:13:38,352 --> 01:13:40,185
- Well, isn't that a mercy?

207
01:13:40,187 --> 01:13:41,589
- Hey, it is.

208
01:13:44,392 --> 01:13:45,925
You take a wee cup of tea?

209
01:13:45,927 --> 01:13:47,728
- I couldn't put
you to the trouble.

210
01:13:49,063 --> 01:13:50,765
- Sure it's made.

211
01:13:54,335 --> 01:13:55,937
Sit down.

212
01:14:00,141 --> 01:14:01,407
- Thank you.

213
01:14:06,881 --> 01:14:08,914
- So what do you
do for your living?

214
01:14:08,916 --> 01:14:10,683
- I spread the good word.

215
01:14:10,685 --> 01:14:12,584
- A minister or a
pastor or something?

216
01:14:12,586 --> 01:14:15,690
- No, no, a missionary.

217
01:14:17,358 --> 01:14:19,026
- What, you mean
going to Africa?

218
01:14:20,127 --> 01:14:22,227
Preaching to the darkies?

219
01:14:22,229 --> 01:14:25,164
- Every man, woman and child
deserves to hear the good word.

220
01:14:25,166 --> 01:14:26,499
Do you not think?

221
01:14:27,568 --> 01:14:29,702
- I know but Africa?

222
01:14:29,704 --> 01:14:32,938
- And India and South America.

223
01:14:32,940 --> 01:14:35,242
And China and Korea.

224
01:14:36,344 --> 01:14:38,344
I have brought the
good word to black men,

225
01:14:38,346 --> 01:14:40,946
brown men, yellow men, red men.

226
01:14:40,948 --> 01:14:43,481
Any shade of man
you care to imagine.

227
01:14:43,483 --> 01:14:46,354
- My goodness, all them places.

228
01:14:47,722 --> 01:14:50,524
Me and Da went to Blackpool
once on our honeymoon.

229
01:14:51,625 --> 01:14:52,793
We had to get the boat.

230
01:15:18,185 --> 01:15:21,655
One thing you won't find in
this house is a blunt knife.

231
01:15:23,824 --> 01:15:25,693
Da keeps them all like razors.

232
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:28,494
You could shave with that there.

233
01:15:28,496 --> 01:15:29,330
- Is that right?

234
01:15:30,431 --> 01:15:32,398
- He earns his living
from his knives,

235
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:36,101
just like his father did
and his father before that.

236
01:15:36,103 --> 01:15:37,403
They're all butchers.

237
01:15:37,405 --> 01:15:38,406
- It's a good trade.

238
01:15:39,306 --> 01:15:40,939
- Keeps us going.

239
01:15:40,941 --> 01:15:42,541
We raised a few
animals ourselves

240
01:15:42,543 --> 01:15:43,809
and some of the local farmers

241
01:15:43,811 --> 01:15:46,445
bring their animals
to us for butchering.

242
01:15:46,447 --> 01:15:49,516
Keeps him busy, milk?

243
01:15:49,518 --> 01:15:50,351
- Yes, please.

244
01:15:52,453 --> 01:15:53,819
Aye.

245
01:15:53,821 --> 01:15:56,055
People will always
want their beef.

246
01:15:56,057 --> 01:15:56,891
- Aye.

247
01:16:00,094 --> 01:16:04,865
- So you sell the meat
from here, like a shop?

248
01:16:06,000 --> 01:16:08,834
- Sort of, Da works
in the big shed.

249
01:16:08,836 --> 01:16:10,638
You'll have saw that
when you drove up.

250
01:16:11,772 --> 01:16:13,172
That's where he
sells the beef from.

251
01:16:13,174 --> 01:16:15,974
That's where he does
the butchering too.

252
01:16:15,976 --> 01:16:16,844
- All by himself?

253
01:16:18,012 --> 01:16:20,214
- Wee Danny lends a
hand the odd time.

254
01:16:21,382 --> 01:16:22,483
He's the other sort.

255
01:16:24,051 --> 01:16:25,953
But he's a decent
enough young fellow.

256
01:16:27,788 --> 01:16:28,789
- Is he there today?

257
01:16:29,890 --> 01:16:32,224
- No, not today,
he's in school today.

258
01:16:32,226 --> 01:16:34,762
- So it's just you
and your husband then?

259
01:16:37,765 --> 01:16:39,400
- Aye.

260
01:16:43,504 --> 01:16:46,440
- You haven't been blessed with
children is all I'm asking.

261
01:16:47,708 --> 01:16:48,941
I didn't want to come right out

262
01:16:48,943 --> 01:16:51,078
and say it in case I upset you.

263
01:16:52,146 --> 01:16:56,281
- No, no, we weren't blessed.

264
01:16:56,283 --> 01:16:58,886
I did pray for things to
be different and so did Da,

265
01:17:00,054 --> 01:17:02,156
but the Lord had his
own plans for us.

266
01:17:05,126 --> 01:17:06,260
What about yourself?

267
01:17:08,062 --> 01:17:11,163
- No, my wife and I

268
01:17:11,165 --> 01:17:14,702
did intend to start
a family, but she--

269
01:17:17,738 --> 01:17:19,206
- She what?

270
01:17:21,709 --> 01:17:22,977
- She perished.

271
01:17:24,078 --> 01:17:24,912
- How?

272
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,415
- Malaria, when
we were in India.

273
01:17:32,286 --> 01:17:33,420
- I'm awful sorry.

274
01:17:34,755 --> 01:17:37,789
- She gave her life to
the Lord Jesus Christ.

275
01:17:37,791 --> 01:17:40,294
She died spreading
the good word for him.

276
01:17:41,695 --> 01:17:43,831
I will see her by his
side when the time comes.

277
01:17:44,999 --> 01:17:49,403
- Aye, you will,

278
01:17:50,404 --> 01:17:52,139
you will

279
01:17:55,176 --> 01:17:57,009
You'll stay for a bit
of dinner, won't you?

280
01:17:57,011 --> 01:17:58,611
- I couldn't impose on you.

281
01:17:58,613 --> 01:18:00,547
- You're imposing nothing.

282
01:18:00,549 --> 01:18:02,049
You're staying and that's that.

283
01:18:02,917 --> 01:18:04,151
We're having veal.

284
01:18:05,052 --> 01:18:06,553
- Veal?

285
01:18:06,555 --> 01:18:08,887
- Aye, that's not something
you get every day, is it?

286
01:18:08,889 --> 01:18:11,056
You'll stay for a bit
of veal, won't you?

287
01:18:11,058 --> 01:18:12,459
- Well it does sound lovely.

288
01:18:14,795 --> 01:18:16,163
- What's that you finished?

289
01:18:16,997 --> 01:18:17,831
- Aye.

290
01:18:21,570 --> 01:18:22,369
- What's this?

291
01:18:24,639 --> 01:18:25,906
- We have a visitor.

292
01:18:27,074 --> 01:18:29,644
Mr., you didn't
tell me your name.

293
01:18:30,945 --> 01:18:35,950
- Ivan, Ivan Cutler,

294
01:18:37,785 --> 01:18:39,320
please to meet you Mr. Taggart.

295
01:18:46,193 --> 01:18:48,195
- I near caught you red handed.

296
01:18:49,631 --> 01:18:54,099
- Should've told you
about Da, he's a one.

297
01:18:54,101 --> 01:18:58,806
- Look, the red hand of Ulster.

298
01:19:04,078 --> 01:19:07,248
- Don't get him started,
he'll have you in fits.

299
01:19:10,751 --> 01:19:12,251
- Is there tea?

300
01:19:12,253 --> 01:19:13,954
- Aye, I'll get you wee cup now.

301
01:19:15,856 --> 01:19:16,790
Sit down Ivan.

302
01:19:21,563 --> 01:19:23,563
He's a missionary.

303
01:19:23,565 --> 01:19:24,796
- That right?

304
01:19:24,798 --> 01:19:25,634
- That's right.

305
01:19:28,269 --> 01:19:31,305
- So where've you been?

306
01:19:32,406 --> 01:19:37,411
- Africa, south
America, India, China.

307
01:19:38,979 --> 01:19:40,379
You name a place,
I've been there.

308
01:19:40,381 --> 01:19:41,482
- Borneo.

309
01:19:42,651 --> 01:19:44,850
- I spent a month in
continental Malaysia.

310
01:19:44,852 --> 01:19:45,817
Didn't make it to the island.

311
01:19:45,819 --> 01:19:46,721
- Timbuktu.

312
01:19:49,256 --> 01:19:51,957
- I actually spent
a few days in Mali.

313
01:19:51,959 --> 01:19:52,791
Didn't get as far as--

314
01:19:52,793 --> 01:19:54,295
- Phoenix, Arizona.

315
01:19:55,963 --> 01:19:58,897
- Do you know I've never
been to the United States.

316
01:19:58,899 --> 01:20:01,166
- That's three places.

317
01:20:01,168 --> 01:20:02,002
- Sorry?

318
01:20:03,170 --> 01:20:07,205
- You says name a place,
I named three places,

319
01:20:07,207 --> 01:20:08,610
you've been to none of them.

320
01:20:10,177 --> 01:20:11,711
- Well I was speaking
figuratively.

321
01:20:11,713 --> 01:20:13,211
I mean obviously there are
places I haven't been to.

322
01:20:13,213 --> 01:20:15,581
- You were playing the smart
man and I caught you out.

323
01:20:15,583 --> 01:20:16,417
Isn't that right?

324
01:20:17,619 --> 01:20:20,052
- Well, I don't know if
I would put it exactly.

325
01:20:20,054 --> 01:20:22,154
- You were playing
the smart man.

326
01:20:22,156 --> 01:20:23,355
- I wouldn't.

327
01:20:23,357 --> 01:20:25,993
- You were playing
the smart man.

328
01:20:36,638 --> 01:20:38,405
- What about
yourself, Mr. Taggart?

329
01:20:39,373 --> 01:20:40,341
Where have you been?

330
01:20:42,943 --> 01:20:46,347
- A few places, but I
don't crow about it.

331
01:20:47,414 --> 01:20:49,416
- Neither do I but you asked.

332
01:20:53,688 --> 01:20:55,588
- It's getting late. You
have a bit of a drive

333
01:20:55,590 --> 01:20:57,124
to Colraine, if that's
where you're for.

334
01:21:00,528 --> 01:21:02,662
- Mrs. Taggert asked
me to stay for dinner.

335
01:21:02,664 --> 01:21:03,763
- Has she now?

336
01:21:03,765 --> 01:21:05,097
- That's right.

337
01:21:05,099 --> 01:21:07,167
- Is that right, ma?

338
01:21:09,838 --> 01:21:13,071
Did you ask this young fellow
to stay for his dinner?

339
01:21:13,073 --> 01:21:13,907
- Aye.

340
01:21:15,677 --> 01:21:16,845
- You sure?

341
01:21:17,978 --> 01:21:19,211
- Aye.

342
01:21:19,213 --> 01:21:20,515
- Are you absolutely sure?

343
01:21:23,884 --> 01:21:25,953
- Aye, I'm sure.

344
01:21:29,456 --> 01:21:32,859
- Right, so you're staying then.

345
01:21:32,861 --> 01:21:34,292
- If it's not too much trouble?

346
01:21:34,294 --> 01:21:35,764
- Oh, it's no trouble for me.

347
01:21:39,032 --> 01:21:39,868
- Good.

348
01:21:45,540 --> 01:21:47,807
- So what church are you with?

349
01:21:47,809 --> 01:21:50,843
- Oh, I'm not with any
church in particular.

350
01:21:50,845 --> 01:21:52,944
I believe the Lord
has many houses.

351
01:21:52,946 --> 01:21:54,614
- What were you reared as?

352
01:21:54,616 --> 01:21:55,416
- Presbyterian.

353
01:21:56,917 --> 01:21:58,851
- We're Church of Ireland,
but we don't make any odds

354
01:21:58,853 --> 01:22:00,252
between the one or the other,

355
01:22:00,254 --> 01:22:02,354
except the payments of course.

356
01:22:02,356 --> 01:22:03,190
- Course.

357
01:22:05,292 --> 01:22:07,492
- So you're not
drumming up business

358
01:22:07,494 --> 01:22:09,094
for any church in particular?

359
01:22:09,096 --> 01:22:10,996
- No, I'm not working
for any one church.

360
01:22:10,998 --> 01:22:13,398
I'm a freelancer, as they say.

361
01:22:13,400 --> 01:22:16,168
Which brings me to why I
am calling on you today.

362
01:22:16,170 --> 01:22:17,004
- All right?

363
01:22:18,506 --> 01:22:21,973
- Because I'm not affiliated
with any one particular church,

364
01:22:21,975 --> 01:22:23,942
I'm beholden to good
people such as yourselves

365
01:22:23,944 --> 01:22:25,511
to fund my expeditions.

366
01:22:25,513 --> 01:22:28,213
- Right, so you're
looking for money.

367
01:22:28,215 --> 01:22:29,751
- For the Lord's work, yes.

368
01:22:31,251 --> 01:22:34,286
- We give our tithes to the
Church of Ireland every week.

369
01:22:34,288 --> 01:22:35,987
There are some weeks
we can afford it.

370
01:22:35,989 --> 01:22:37,456
There are some weeks
we can't afford it,

371
01:22:37,458 --> 01:22:38,927
but we give it just the same.

372
01:22:41,328 --> 01:22:42,530
- I understand.

373
01:22:43,898 --> 01:22:47,165
Well, you've already
been more than generous

374
01:22:47,167 --> 01:22:50,268
with your hospitality,
I don't want to be.

375
01:23:06,186 --> 01:23:07,020
What the?

376
01:23:33,848 --> 01:23:34,849
I know you're there.

377
01:23:36,383 --> 01:23:37,752
What do you want, Taggart?

378
01:23:44,926 --> 01:23:48,630
Whatever it is you want,
we can talk it through.

379
01:23:50,732 --> 01:23:51,566
You want money?

380
01:23:53,701 --> 01:23:54,602
I've got money.

381
01:23:55,904 --> 01:23:58,036
There's three rolls of it there.

382
01:23:58,038 --> 01:23:59,941
I don't even know how
much there is there.

383
01:24:00,875 --> 01:24:03,578
150, probably more.

384
01:24:05,145 --> 01:24:07,013
It's yours.

385
01:24:07,015 --> 01:24:11,553
You can have it all, just
tell me what you want.

386
01:24:13,621 --> 01:24:16,824
Let me go now, well forget
about it, all right?

387
01:24:18,893 --> 01:24:20,060
If you don't let me go,

388
01:24:21,228 --> 01:24:26,233
I swear to you, I
am going to skin you

389
01:24:27,434 --> 01:24:30,038
and your bitch wife
alive, you hear me?

390
01:24:31,238 --> 01:24:33,106
You fucking hear me Taggart,

391
01:24:34,274 --> 01:24:39,079
Taggart I know you're
there, Taggart, Taggart,

392
01:24:40,280 --> 01:24:42,282
let me outta here.

393
01:24:43,985 --> 01:24:46,953
Taggart, let me the
fuck outta here,

394
01:24:46,955 --> 01:24:51,958
I'll fucking kill you,
you're a fucking dead man,

395
01:24:51,960 --> 01:24:55,928
you're a dead man, you
and your fucking wife,

396
01:24:55,930 --> 01:24:58,800
are both fucking dead.

397
01:25:08,475 --> 01:25:10,275
- So?

398
01:25:11,679 --> 01:25:12,513
- So what?

399
01:25:14,015 --> 01:25:15,115
- So why him?

400
01:25:17,652 --> 01:25:19,654
- I liked the cut of him.

401
01:25:23,891 --> 01:25:26,060
- I suppose that's as
good a reason as any.

402
01:25:30,263 --> 01:25:33,799
Dear Father, we thank
you for this blessing,

403
01:25:33,801 --> 01:25:35,803
for this bounteous gift today,

404
01:25:36,871 --> 01:25:39,471
we eat with gratitude
in our hearts.

405
01:25:39,473 --> 01:25:43,210
Thank you oh Lord for what
we are about to receive,

406
01:25:44,512 --> 01:25:46,912
our Father which art in heaven,

407
01:25:46,914 --> 01:25:48,848
hallowed be thy name.

408
01:25:48,850 --> 01:25:52,551
Thy kingdom come, thy
will be done on earth

409
01:25:52,553 --> 01:25:53,953
as it is in heaven.

410
01:25:53,955 --> 01:25:56,421
Give us this day our daily bread

411
01:25:56,423 --> 01:25:58,824
and forgive us our trespasses

412
01:25:58,826 --> 01:26:02,327
as we forgive those who
trespass against us.

413
01:26:02,329 --> 01:26:04,830
And lead us not into temptation,

414
01:26:04,832 --> 01:26:07,099
but deliver us from evil.

415
01:26:07,101 --> 01:26:09,568
For thine is the
kingdom, the power

416
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:13,641
and the glory, forever
and ever, Amen.
