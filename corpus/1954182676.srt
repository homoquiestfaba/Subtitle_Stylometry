1
00:01:47,517 --> 00:01:49,177
Mom?

<i>What's that?</i>

9
00:02:40,216 --> 00:02:44,165
A friend of mine.
Uh, his Mom has died.

10
00:02:44,854 --> 00:02:48,153
That's awful.
- Yeah.

11
00:02:51,954 --> 00:02:54,391
You wanna get something to eat first?

12
00:02:54,392 --> 00:02:56,992
No, we're there already.

13
00:03:42,180 --> 00:03:44,503
Hey, when did you get here?

14
00:03:44,504 --> 00:03:46,304
Oh, just this morning.

15
00:03:46,644 --> 00:03:50,560
I'm really sorry about your Mom.

16
00:03:52,285 --> 00:03:55,500
Oh, I'm sorry.
Buck, this is Carlyn, my fiancée.

17
00:03:55,501 --> 00:03:58,001
I'm so sorry.

18
00:03:58,250 --> 00:04:00,425
I'm glad you could make it, you know?

19
00:04:00,504 --> 00:04:03,433
I think about you all the time,
us as kids and stuff.

20
00:04:03,434 --> 00:04:05,534
You don't look much different.

21
00:04:05,535 --> 00:04:09,535
You do.
Your face is fatter.

22
00:04:11,714 --> 00:04:14,060
Hello, how are you?

23
00:04:36,785 --> 00:04:38,831
I thought that she was dead...
- Boo!

24
00:04:38,845 --> 00:04:44,164
Hey. - Hey, are you guys bored?
What are you doing?

25
00:04:44,211 --> 00:04:46,434
You wanna go see my room?

26
00:04:46,459 --> 00:04:48,438
It's my Mom.

27
00:04:48,703 --> 00:04:50,613
She's pretty.

28
00:04:50,783 --> 00:04:55,081
She would've hated this,
all this people in her house.

29
00:04:58,516 --> 00:05:01,711
It's kind of strange to see you
after all this years, I mean...

30
00:05:01,712 --> 00:05:04,512
under these circumstances.

31
00:05:06,802 --> 00:05:10,569
Guess who this is.
It's me and Chuck.

32
00:05:10,683 --> 00:05:12,148
Chuck?

33
00:05:12,264 --> 00:05:14,316
I go by Charlie now, pretty much.

34
00:05:14,395 --> 00:05:16,070
Chuck and Buck.

35
00:05:16,071 --> 00:05:19,371
That's so adorable. Look at you
guys, you're such a little cuties.

36
00:05:19,372 --> 00:05:22,072
I have a whole box of pictures.

37
00:05:22,194 --> 00:05:24,420
You guys should spend a night?

38
00:05:24,529 --> 00:05:26,754
We gotta get back, um...

39
00:05:26,845 --> 00:05:28,673
We got a flight at 8:00 o'clock.

40
00:05:28,674 --> 00:05:30,674
<i>Back to L.A.?</i>

41
00:05:31,768 --> 00:05:34,506
You live there too?

42
00:05:34,943 --> 00:05:38,080
Yeah, we live together.

43
00:05:45,207 --> 00:05:47,219
You should come visit L.A.

44

00:06:50,068 --> 00:06:51,862
Hi.

52
00:07:00,089 --> 00:07:03,072
So, I was thinking that, uh...

53
00:07:03,605 --> 00:07:05,103
you should stay...

54
00:07:05,104 --> 00:07:08,104
<i>and go back tomorrow.</i>

55
00:07:10,094 --> 00:07:16,555
Oh, I wish we could, um...
It's just work and everything...

56
00:07:17,903 --> 00:07:22,596
But y-you should visit in L.A.
You should...

57
00:07:37,670 --> 00:07:41,557
What? Hey, what are you
doing, man? No, no!

58
00:07:49,130 --> 00:07:51,702
We're going.
- OK.

59
00:07:51,703 --> 00:07:55,003
Don't you wanna say goodbye?
- Yeah, I did.

60
00:09:13,196 --> 00:09:15,659
<i>Hey, this is a message for Chuck.</i>

61
00:09:15,660 --> 00:09:18,060
Hey Chuck, it's Buck.

62
00:09:18,096 --> 00:09:20,345
How's it goin'?
Um...

63
00:09:20,476 --> 00:09:24,369
I, uh... was thinking about what
you said about coming to Los Angeles...

64
00:09:24,370 --> 00:09:28,870
and, uh...
I thought I might do that. So...

65
00:09:28,871 --> 00:09:29,971
Uh...

66
00:09:29,977 --> 00:09:33,286
You know...
Oh, my number is 805...

67
00:09:33,287 --> 00:09:36,687

you don't have it.

68
00:09:36,688 --> 00:09:40,488
And, um... So, you know...
Call me and, uh...

69
00:09:40,536 --> 00:09:43,114
let me know, you know...

70
00:09:43,241 --> 00:09:48,549
whatever, OK?
All right? Okay, bye.

Thank you.

74
00:10:12,777 --> 00:10:15,472

82
00:10:48,691 --> 00:10:52,491

And-and I hope you're doing OK.</i>

83
00:10:52,492 --> 00:10:55,992

Hi. That's a really nice shirt.

103
00:13:23,505 --> 00:13:26,505
My Mom bought it for me.

104
00:13:27,256 --> 00:13:29,051
Well, can I help you with something?

105
00:13:29,052 --> 00:13:32,252
I'm here to see Chuck Sitter, Charles.

106
00:13:32,256 --> 00:13:33,957
He's up on the sixth floor.

107
00:13:33,958 --> 00:13:38,473
Oh, if you just hold on
for one second, I'll call him.

108
00:13:38,535 --> 00:13:40,354
<i>Hi, it's Diane.</i>

109
00:13:40,355 --> 00:13:43,055
There's a, um...
What's your name?

110
00:13:43,056 --> 00:13:46,556
What?
- What's your name?

111
00:13:47,747 --> 00:13:49,089
No...

112
00:13:49,625 --> 00:13:50,533
No...

113
00:13:50,534 --> 00:13:52,034
Huh...

114
00:14:19,076 --> 00:14:22,051
I'm delivering some artwork,
Sitter, sixth floor.

115
00:14:22,052 --> 00:14:24,052
All right.

116
00:14:51,044 --> 00:14:52,737
<i>Hey, wo! Hold up!</i>

117
00:14:52,838 --> 00:14:55,838
Wait up!
Hold it, hold the door.

118
00:16:03,015 --> 00:16:06,069
Hi.
- Hi. Can I help you?

119
00:16:06,211 --> 00:16:10,879
Um... Do you put on plays here,
and people come and see 'em?

120
00:16:10,980 --> 00:16:13,580
Well, this is a theatre.

121
00:16:13,720 --> 00:16:16,627
Well, say I thought of a play,

122
00:16:16,851 --> 00:16:19,066
w-would you put that on?

123
00:16:19,113 --> 00:16:23,293
You've written a play?
- I've never...

124
00:16:23,368 --> 00:16:27,898
Oh. Just creating
a hipothetical scenario?

125
00:16:27,914 --> 00:16:30,065
What if, um...

126
00:16:30,594 --> 00:16:32,524
What if I didn't
want you to read it?

127
00:16:32,607 --> 00:16:36,346
Well, you could write at the top of
the page: "Don't let Beverly read it".

128
00:16:36,431 --> 00:16:39,720
I'll beg and plead, but
they won't let me read it.

129
00:16:39,721 --> 00:16:43,721
Oh, no... What I... What I meant
was, um... - I know what you meant.

130
00:16:43,843 --> 00:16:45,697
You could rent out the theatre.

131
00:16:45,698 --> 00:16:49,098
On Monday evenings
they make it available for just...

132
00:16:49,099 --> 00:16:52,099
you know, secret plays.

133
00:16:53,356 --> 00:16:55,770
OK, thanks.

134
00:16:56,242 --> 00:17:00,749
So, why are you always
standing in front of the theatre?

135
00:17:00,785 --> 00:17:04,583
Oh, um...
I'm waiting for my friend.

136
00:17:11,078 --> 00:17:12,649
Hey.

137
00:17:12,711 --> 00:17:15,623
Buck, what the hell...
What are you doing in L.A.?

138
00:17:15,755 --> 00:17:17,543
I've moved here.

139
00:17:17,971 --> 00:17:20,247
You live here?
Since when?

140
00:17:20,248 --> 00:17:22,048
Oh, not that long,
just a few weeks.

141
00:17:22,054 --> 00:17:27,071
Wow. What are you doing?
- Well, I was over at a...

142
00:17:27,084 --> 00:17:30,153
Gorgio's? The food's great,
if you like fish.

143
00:17:30,154 --> 00:17:34,354
I mean, what are you doing in L.A.?
- I'm putting on a play.

144
00:17:34,436 --> 00:17:35,570
You are?

145
00:17:35,622 --> 00:17:38,661
Yeah, I was thinking about
those plays we used to put on.

146
00:17:38,662 --> 00:17:41,362
I was thinking about, you know,
"The Devil and the Raindeer".

147
00:17:41,363 --> 00:17:43,263
"The Devil and the Raindeer"?

148
00:17:43,340 --> 00:17:45,272
Uh-huh. - It was a...
- They both have horns...

149
00:17:45,273 --> 00:17:47,573
so they team up
against Santa.

150
00:17:47,592 --> 00:17:49,851
How was New York?

151
00:17:49,869 --> 00:17:53,050
Oh, it got cancelled.
Um... I didn't go.

152
00:17:53,051 --> 00:17:54,351
Oh...

153
00:17:55,207 --> 00:17:56,244
I see.

154
00:18:01,611 --> 00:18:03,956
You know, we're having
some people over tomorrow night.

155
00:18:03,957 --> 00:18:06,257
It's a little party
for Charlie's promotion.

156
00:18:06,258 --> 00:18:10,058
Yeah, I should've remembered that.
Um... Yeah, you should come. It'll be great.

157
00:18:10,059 --> 00:18:13,759
Uh... I'll give you directions.
Do you have a pen? - Yeah.

158
00:18:13,906 --> 00:18:17,668
Well, I can find it.
What time?

159
00:18:17,813 --> 00:18:20,722
People are coming
around 10:00, 10:30.

160
00:18:20,723 --> 00:18:23,023
It starts at 8:00.
- Whenever.

161
00:18:23,024 --> 00:18:25,724
That'll be great.
- OK.

162
00:18:25,949 --> 00:18:27,804
Well, I'll see you tomorrow.

163
00:18:27,805 --> 00:18:29,705
Great... bye.
- See you tomorrow.

164
00:18:29,894 --> 00:18:31,546
Bye.

165
00:18:40,962 --> 00:18:42,970
Bye.
- Bye.

166
00:19:50,983 --> 00:19:53,082
Hey, Buck!
- Oh, hi.

167
00:19:53,083 --> 00:19:55,883
You made it. - Yeah.
- You look nice.

168
00:19:55,885 --> 00:19:59,752
Can I get you something?
Something to drink or to eat...?

169
00:19:59,821 --> 00:20:03,539
Rum and Coke.
- OK.

170
00:20:03,645 --> 00:20:07,462
Rum and Coke for him,
and I'll take the Chardonney.

171
00:20:07,827 --> 00:20:09,238
So, you made it.

172
00:20:09,346 --> 00:20:11,230
Did you have any trouble
finding the house?

173
00:20:11,382 --> 00:20:15,503
Where is Charlie? - I don't know,
I think he's probably out back or something.

174
00:20:15,504 --> 00:20:19,104
I love those West Indian basket woman
things you have in the living room.

175
00:20:19,105 --> 00:20:22,405
Thank you! God, I was afraid people
are gonna think they were racist.

176
00:20:22,406 --> 00:20:23,906
My decorater pushed me into it.

177
00:20:23,973 --> 00:20:26,402
Jolie, this is Buck,
friend of Charlie's from home.

178
00:20:26,403 --> 00:20:28,003
How do you do?
- Oh, hi.

179
00:20:28,050 --> 00:20:31,624
Well, guys, I'm gonna go make the round.
- By all means, go play hostes.

180
00:20:31,625 --> 00:20:33,825
And you're friends with Charlie?

181
00:20:33,826 --> 00:20:35,826
Yeah, best friends.
Well, when we were kids.

182
00:20:35,827 --> 00:20:37,527
What are you doing in L.A, Buck?

183
00:20:37,676 --> 00:20:41,482
Oh, nothing. - I know a lot
of people who have that job.

184
00:20:41,483 --> 00:20:45,483
It's one of the better jobs you can have.
I bet you're very good at it.

185
00:20:45,526 --> 00:20:48,134
I kind of wanna talk to Charlie right now.

186
00:20:48,163 --> 00:20:49,887
OK, I think he's out back.

187
00:20:49,888 --> 00:20:53,788
But thanks for talking to me.
- Oh, no. It's nice meeting you.

188
00:21:02,479 --> 00:21:04,126
Hey, Chuck!
- Hey, man.

189
00:21:04,127 --> 00:21:06,227
You want a drink?
- Oh... no, I have one.

190
00:21:06,228 --> 00:21:08,528
OK, see you in a second.

191
00:21:29,072 --> 00:21:31,142
Oh!
- Oh, hey... sorry.

192
00:21:31,143 --> 00:21:32,643
I was just looking around.

193
00:21:33,145 --> 00:21:36,483
It's okay, I'm just gonna
touch up my make-up.

194
00:21:36,566 --> 00:21:39,135
Are you having any fun?

195
00:21:40,367 --> 00:21:43,520
Yeah... I noticed there was
no pictures of me anywhere.

196
00:21:43,713 --> 00:21:47,419
Oh, yeah.
Charlie doesn't have any pictures.

197
00:21:47,592 --> 00:21:50,683
He's not a very sentimental guy.

198
00:21:50,747 --> 00:21:52,573
<i>What was he like
when you knew him?</i>

199
00:21:52,651 --> 00:21:54,235
Oh, he was fun.

200
00:21:54,385 --> 00:21:56,950
<i>Yeah, we had fun.</i>

201
00:22:01,515 --> 00:22:04,712
I think Charlie wants to hang out
with his other friends tonight.

202
00:22:04,748 --> 00:22:08,243
Well, there are a lot of people here
from his work and everything.

203
00:22:08,341 --> 00:22:10,534
He really cares a lot about his work.

204
00:22:10,535 --> 00:22:13,435
But I know he's glad you're here.

205
00:22:21,944 --> 00:22:24,232
...they were incredible.
I think they're gonna be huge!

206
00:22:24,233 --> 00:22:25,833
Yeah, that's probably true.

207
00:22:34,092 --> 00:22:37,522
Hoody, where's your
music supervisor from Fresno?

208
00:22:37,886 --> 00:22:39,789
Hey, Chuck.
- Hey, Buck.

209
00:22:39,790 --> 00:22:44,090
Buck, this is Josh Weintraub.
- Hi.

210
00:22:44,178 --> 00:22:45,890
Tony Maxwell.
- How you're doing?

211
00:22:45,945 --> 00:22:47,832
Vince Duffy.
- How's it?

212
00:22:47,836 --> 00:22:49,794
And Melissa...
- Booth.

213
00:22:49,861 --> 00:22:51,331
Buck's a friend of mine from up North.

214
00:22:51,483 --> 00:22:55,010
So, how's it going?
- I like your house.

215
00:22:55,127 --> 00:22:57,017
Do you... um...

216
00:22:57,188 --> 00:22:59,545
It's very...

217
00:23:00,233 --> 00:23:01,615
Who, um...?

218
00:23:01,768 --> 00:23:06,521
Let it out, Buck.
- It's a very old-persony.

219
00:23:07,602 --> 00:23:09,583
Yeah, last time Buck and I saw each other...

220
00:23:09,602 --> 00:23:13,793
we were camping out in his parent's backyard,
eating potato chips, playing spy games...

221
00:23:13,794 --> 00:23:15,694
Good old days.
- Exactly.

222
00:23:15,897 --> 00:23:20,567
He went by Chuck, and I was Buck,
so we were Chuck and Buck.

223
00:23:22,435 --> 00:23:24,060
All the other kids wanted to play with us...

224
00:23:24,061 --> 00:23:26,261
but, you know, we wouldn't let them.

225
00:23:26,296 --> 00:23:29,002
Well, Charlie hasn't changed,
he's still a very exclusive guy.

226
00:23:29,003 --> 00:23:31,303
We'd get in such royal trouble too.

227
00:23:31,459 --> 00:23:34,839
Once my parents grounded me
for a week because we took our...

228
00:23:34,840 --> 00:23:36,540
Listen guys, I'm gonna go get a drink.

229
00:23:36,573 --> 00:23:41,553
Charlie, I'd love to, um...
- Yeah, I know. I'm just gonna get a drink.

230
00:26:36,624 --> 00:26:37,498
Hello?

231
00:26:37,499 --> 00:26:41,199
<i>Hello, is... is Charlie there?</i>

232
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:42,235
Is this Buck?

233
00:26:42,236 --> 00:26:44,036
<i>Yeah, hi.</i>

234
00:26:44,559 --> 00:26:47,121
Hold on.
Talk to him.

235
00:26:47,122 --> 00:26:48,822
I don't want to.

236
00:26:52,025 --> 00:26:56,246
Buck, um...
Charlie's not around.

237
00:26:56,418 --> 00:26:59,674
<i>But, uh...
I'll let him know that you called.</i>

238
00:27:00,406 --> 00:27:01,328
OK.

239
00:27:01,329 --> 00:27:04,129
<i>OK, bye.</i>

240
00:27:04,809 --> 00:27:09,104
OK, Mr Wise Tree. All right, don't forget
you know all and you don't say anything.

241
00:27:09,105 --> 00:27:11,805
Just move a little bit...
There you go. Perfect.

242
00:27:11,806 --> 00:27:13,592
<i>Now, we're gonna take it
from where the Scarecrow...</i>

243
00:27:13,593 --> 00:27:16,793
<i>is having a very hard time waking up.</i>

244
00:27:16,833 --> 00:27:20,879
Now, all of you face the audience...
Share, share that face with the audience.

245
00:27:20,980 --> 00:27:22,680
Don't forget you men are straws,
so bluh, bluh...

246
00:27:22,725 --> 00:27:27,033
We need Dorothy - this is you,
sweetheart - try to wake him up!

247
00:27:27,434 --> 00:27:30,034
OK, so wake up, Strawman.
Wake up, Strawman!

248
00:27:30,106 --> 00:27:33,011
<i>Wake up, Strawman!</i>

249
00:27:33,302 --> 00:27:36,778
Well, if it isn't the man who's
waiting for his friend? - Hey!

250
00:27:36,881 --> 00:27:39,534
You remember me?

251
00:27:40,072 --> 00:27:44,903
Oh, well, um... I wrote a...
I wrote a play. - Over a day?

252
00:27:45,127 --> 00:27:48,965
Yeah, and I was kind of hoping
you could help me.

253
00:27:49,165 --> 00:27:52,293
What? Direct-produce?

254
00:27:52,381 --> 00:27:53,801
<i>Yeah.</i>

255
00:27:55,147 --> 00:27:58,485
Well, I'm the house manager,
I don't know shit about directing.

256
00:27:58,486 --> 00:28:01,586
That's OK.

257
00:28:02,218 --> 00:28:07,515
No, it wouldn't work. You'll
have to pay me by the hour.

258
00:28:07,705 --> 00:28:09,894
<i>How much?</i>

259
00:28:10,280 --> 00:28:11,933
25$ an hour.

260
00:28:11,934 --> 00:28:13,134
OK.

261
00:28:22,560 --> 00:28:24,614
What's all this stuff?

262
00:28:24,615 --> 00:28:26,915
This is... this is it.
- This is it?

263
00:28:27,016 --> 00:28:29,616
Yeah.

264
00:28:37,041 --> 00:28:39,367
"Hank and Frank".

265
00:28:39,435 --> 00:28:41,231
<i>Is this a children's play?</i>

266
00:28:41,232 --> 00:28:43,232
Well, it has kids in it.

267
00:28:43,233 --> 00:28:46,133
Um... In... in the first part
they're kids, and in the...

268
00:28:46,134 --> 00:28:51,734
second part they're... they're older.
- Uh-huh, time laps, huh? I gotcha.

269
00:28:51,735 --> 00:28:53,835
<i>So when can you read it?</i>

270
00:29:08,057 --> 00:29:11,387
<i>I don't think this is a children's play.</i>

271
00:29:11,458 --> 00:29:14,774
It's way out there.

272
00:29:16,600 --> 00:29:20,025
I think you have
something weird about women...

273
00:29:20,026 --> 00:29:22,926
I think you have
something weird about men.

274
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:25,039
How old are you?

275
00:29:25,083 --> 00:29:27,112
27.

276
00:29:30,206 --> 00:29:33,476
Your face is, uh...
i-i-it's twiching.

277
00:29:33,622 --> 00:29:38,288
Oh, yeah, it... Sometimes it, uh...
I have, uh...

278
00:29:38,389 --> 00:29:41,189
When I'm nervous.

279
00:29:42,622 --> 00:29:45,106
So, how many nights do you want
to book the theatre?

280
00:29:45,107 --> 00:29:47,007
One.

281
00:29:47,236 --> 00:29:49,012
One?

282
00:29:49,078 --> 00:29:51,976
You're just gonna do it
for one night only?

283
00:29:52,082 --> 00:29:53,280
Well, all right.

284
00:29:53,436 --> 00:29:57,623
Uh... I can reserve
the first Monday in December.

285
00:29:57,624 --> 00:29:59,824
That'll give us
four weeks for rehearsal.

286
00:29:59,825 --> 00:30:04,725
Now, about the 25$ an hour:
are you bullshiting me?

287
00:30:04,845 --> 00:30:06,603
No.

288
00:30:07,593 --> 00:30:10,708
OK. Well, I'm gonna ask you
to pay me every week.

289
00:30:10,709 --> 00:30:14,109
And I'll keep a record of my hours.

290
00:30:14,235 --> 00:30:16,064
Hi Jamila, it's Diane.

291
00:30:16,158 --> 00:30:19,248
There's Buck O'Brien here to see Charlie.

292
00:30:19,332 --> 00:30:22,478
<i>He says he doesn't
have an appointment.</i>

293
00:30:25,197 --> 00:30:28,637
He's in a meeting, but you can
wait here and then he'll see you.

294
00:30:28,719 --> 00:30:30,110
Hi, Diane.
- Hi.

295
00:30:30,285 --> 00:30:33,539
Hi, I'm Jamila,
I'm Charlie's assistant.

296
00:30:33,540 --> 00:30:36,740
He's still in a meeting, but you
can come up and wait if you want.

297
00:30:36,751 --> 00:30:38,105
Oh, OK.

298
00:30:46,924 --> 00:30:49,265
<i>Get that cover letter to Ed Stegner.</i>

299
00:30:49,275 --> 00:30:52,986
Recipy was in the office, did they sent
those tapes with the samples on 'em?

300
00:30:53,028 --> 00:30:54,919
Oh, they did, I have it.

301
00:30:54,920 --> 00:30:57,520
Jesus, Jamila, I've been asking you
for those tapes for two days.

302
00:30:57,521 --> 00:31:00,321
Well, it just came.

303
00:31:03,536 --> 00:31:06,673
Hey, Buck! You had a good time
at the party the other night?

304
00:31:06,827 --> 00:31:10,091
Sure... at first.

305
00:31:10,327 --> 00:31:12,973
I don't know about parties.

306
00:31:13,027 --> 00:31:15,454
They're all asking me what I do.

307
00:31:15,506 --> 00:31:17,170
How's the play?

308
00:31:17,228 --> 00:31:21,055
The play?
Well, it's not really...

309
00:31:21,328 --> 00:31:25,033
But I... What I want...
I want to spend time, uh... hanging out...

310
00:31:25,034 --> 00:31:27,134
<i>with you, and catching up.</i>

311
00:31:27,258 --> 00:31:29,328
Yeah. I mean, me too.
That'll be great.

312
00:31:29,329 --> 00:31:34,329
Yeah, because we really haven't seen each
other and I feel bad that we didn't keep up.

313
00:31:34,333 --> 00:31:36,062
You know, I...
I feel it's my fault.

314
00:31:36,063 --> 00:31:41,663
It's not your fault. I mean, I moved.
You know, these things happen.

315
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:48,534
So... what have you been doing?
- Well...

316
00:31:48,535 --> 00:31:51,835
My Mom was sick for, like, five years.

317
00:31:51,980 --> 00:31:54,621
So I was kind of taking care of her.

318
00:31:55,994 --> 00:31:58,243
Yeah, it must've been tuff.

319
00:32:03,546 --> 00:32:08,232
Hey, that's my band.
I signed those guys.

320
00:32:09,533 --> 00:32:14,333
<i>» I'll leave the frown I'm locked
'cause I can't hear the... «</i>

321
00:32:14,347 --> 00:32:16,533
You know, I kind of meaned to, uh...

322
00:32:17,218 --> 00:32:19,822
write you or... or call you.

323
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:23,512
Yeah, 'cause I thought about you
all the time, you know.

324
00:32:23,619 --> 00:32:27,001
After you left, I didn't really get into
school at all, you know.

325
00:32:27,002 --> 00:32:29,302
I didn't like the other kids so much.

326
00:32:29,303 --> 00:32:33,670
All the homework and sports
just weren't that fun.

327
00:32:35,142 --> 00:32:37,815
It's weird you have this office.

328
00:32:37,900 --> 00:32:40,074
What are you doing here?

329
00:32:40,142 --> 00:32:42,442
Sign bands and produce and...

330
00:32:42,556 --> 00:32:44,904
negotiate contracts.

331
00:32:46,016 --> 00:32:49,141
<i>I mean, it's not... not that interesting.</i>

332
00:32:49,171 --> 00:32:52,506
That's funny, that's really funny.

333
00:32:52,610 --> 00:32:56,379
'Cause, you remember we used to
play games like we were businessmen.

334
00:32:56,405 --> 00:32:59,589
Remember we bought
all those office supplies?

335
00:32:59,590 --> 00:33:02,626
And now you're, like, really doing it.

336
00:33:03,113 --> 00:33:07,508
Is it real now or is it
still like a game?

337
00:33:09,059 --> 00:33:12,566
It's pretty real.

338
00:33:16,067 --> 00:33:18,756
Remember all those games
we used to play?

339
00:33:18,835 --> 00:33:21,473
<i>Charlie, Marion Cash.</i>

340
00:33:21,544 --> 00:33:24,483
I'll return... No, I'll take it.

341
00:33:24,581 --> 00:33:28,562
Uh, Buck, I gotta get back to work.

342
00:33:28,778 --> 00:33:32,117
Oh... OK.
- But I'm glad you came by.

343
00:33:32,210 --> 00:33:34,703
So, we should get
some lunch sometime, OK?

344
00:33:34,704 --> 00:33:37,132
<i>I'll just give Jamila your number
and we'll get together.</i>

345
00:33:37,133 --> 00:33:39,249
Oh, all right.

346
00:33:39,310 --> 00:33:44,850
Well, um... Bye Chuck, I'm, you know...
glad that we're... - Yeah, me too.

347
00:33:44,939 --> 00:33:48,972
Oh, I almost forgot...
I wanna get a picture of us.

348
00:33:49,061 --> 00:33:50,444
Um...

349
00:33:50,745 --> 00:33:52,445
Right now?

350
00:33:52,509 --> 00:33:54,402
Well, I was kind of hoping, yeah.

351
00:33:56,090 --> 00:33:58,799
OK... Jamila!

352
00:33:59,453 --> 00:34:02,385
Yes? - Can you
help us out here... please?

353
00:34:02,401 --> 00:34:03,813
Here.

354
00:34:06,974 --> 00:34:09,229
Are you guys ready?
- Take the picture.

355
00:34:09,330 --> 00:34:10,430
One...

356
00:34:10,507 --> 00:34:13,706
two, three.

357
00:34:13,852 --> 00:34:15,945
Here you go.
- Thanks.

358
00:34:38,679 --> 00:34:39,605
I'll get it.

359
00:34:39,606 --> 00:34:41,505
You're leaving?
- No.

360
00:34:48,627 --> 00:34:50,233
Hey... Buck.

361
00:34:50,234 --> 00:34:53,244
Hey.
- Ever thought of using a phone?

362
00:34:53,318 --> 00:34:56,222
Oh, I was just gonna drop something by.

363
00:34:56,286 --> 00:34:58,300
I can come back later.

364
00:35:01,691 --> 00:35:04,255
Hey, Buck.
- Hi.

365
00:35:05,309 --> 00:35:07,866
Can I get you something to drink?

366
00:35:07,867 --> 00:35:10,263
Oh, no, that's all right.

367
00:35:10,485 --> 00:35:12,827
Would you like some coffee, a bagle?

368
00:35:12,840 --> 00:35:14,729
Would you like some ice-cream?

369
00:35:14,748 --> 00:35:15,532
Really?

370
00:35:15,533 --> 00:35:16,733
Oh... mm...

371
00:35:16,940 --> 00:35:18,409
I like ice-cream.

372
00:35:18,410 --> 00:35:21,568
OK. Do you want some, Charlie?
- No.

373
00:35:22,159 --> 00:35:23,769
What you got there?

374
00:35:23,830 --> 00:35:25,509
Oh, this?

375
00:35:25,674 --> 00:35:28,024
I made this for Chuck.

376
00:35:37,357 --> 00:35:38,724
<i>Wow!</i>

377
00:35:39,567 --> 00:35:42,878
Yeah, I saw that you
didn't have any pictures of us.

378
00:35:42,879 --> 00:35:44,588
So I...
I made this for you.

379
00:35:44,589 --> 00:35:47,036
That's really creative.

380
00:35:47,096 --> 00:35:49,580
This is a picture we took today.

381
00:35:49,631 --> 00:35:51,517
Today?

382
00:35:51,594 --> 00:35:55,496
Oh, yeah, Buck... um...
visited me in the office.

383
00:35:55,580 --> 00:35:56,937
I made one of my Mom...

384
00:35:56,938 --> 00:35:59,750
and then one of me and my Dad
and then this one.

385
00:35:59,751 --> 00:36:01,434
It took a long time.

386
00:36:01,485 --> 00:36:03,547
I bet.

387
00:36:05,485 --> 00:36:07,077
OK, let me, um...

388
00:36:07,078 --> 00:36:09,514
get you that ice-cream.

389
00:36:11,256 --> 00:36:14,535
So, do you remember all these pictures?

390
00:36:14,554 --> 00:36:15,834
Kind of.

391
00:36:15,835 --> 00:36:20,573
I had copies of 'em made,
so you know, I could cut them up.

392
00:36:21,386 --> 00:36:24,556
So, do you like it?

393
00:36:25,748 --> 00:36:27,539
Yeah...

394
00:36:28,055 --> 00:36:31,522
Yeah, it's great.

395
00:36:47,920 --> 00:36:50,521
I love strawberry.

396
00:36:52,879 --> 00:36:55,823
Well, I'm... I'm gonna go up to bed.

397
00:36:55,824 --> 00:36:58,625
Already?
- Yeah, I'm exhausted.

398
00:36:58,674 --> 00:37:00,595
Yeah, so am I.

399
00:37:00,912 --> 00:37:05,517
It was nice to see you again, Buck.
- Right, thanks for the ice-cream.

400
00:37:07,349 --> 00:37:09,538
I'll be right up.
- OK.

401
00:37:09,559 --> 00:37:11,529
See ya.

402
00:37:27,689 --> 00:37:30,059
So, what should we do?

403
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:33,597
Oh, I gotta wake up early tomorrow.

404
00:37:38,188 --> 00:37:41,521
I think we should play a game.

405
00:37:44,843 --> 00:37:47,826
What do you mean? Like,
trivial pursue or something?

406
00:37:49,738 --> 00:37:51,612
Yeah...

407
00:37:52,053 --> 00:37:55,589
Or... like... you know.

408
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,543
<i>What?</i>

409
00:38:00,194 --> 00:38:04,526
Like some other kind of game.

410
00:38:06,333 --> 00:38:08,501
Like what?

411
00:38:13,660 --> 00:38:16,650
Can she hear us?

412
00:38:17,272 --> 00:38:18,938
Carlyn?

413
00:38:19,038 --> 00:38:21,780
What are you talking about?

414
00:38:22,964 --> 00:38:24,635
Like one of those games...

415
00:38:24,636 --> 00:38:27,036
where you stick your dick in my mouth...

416
00:38:27,037 --> 00:38:29,529
and I stick mine in yours.

417
00:38:29,694 --> 00:38:32,525
Chuck and Buck... Suck and fuck.

418
00:38:47,137 --> 00:38:51,546
<i>I think you should get out of here, Buck.</i>

419
00:38:55,382 --> 00:38:59,050
I mean it, get out. Now!

420
00:39:21,972 --> 00:39:24,506
So, this is the "Frank" pile...

421
00:39:24,704 --> 00:39:27,775
and this is the "Hank" pile.

422
00:39:28,423 --> 00:39:31,476
And this is "The Witch" pile.

423
00:39:32,270 --> 00:39:33,816
OK.

424
00:39:34,073 --> 00:39:37,434
I think I have your little Hank and Frank.

425
00:39:37,526 --> 00:39:39,836
I don't know if they're gonna be able to
memorize all those lines...

426
00:39:39,837 --> 00:39:41,356
<i>but let me get them for you.</i>

427
00:39:41,400 --> 00:39:44,860
Jake, Tommy!
Can you come up here, kids?

428
00:39:48,390 --> 00:39:51,305
Hey, guys.
This is Buck, say hello.

429
00:39:51,398 --> 00:39:53,359
Hello.
- Hi.

430
00:40:03,040 --> 00:40:05,654
OK guys, thanks.

431
00:40:09,040 --> 00:40:13,572
Um, well... I think that the one
with the dark hair is okay for Hank.

432
00:40:14,093 --> 00:40:17,770
<i>But the other one's
not really right for Frank.</i>

433
00:40:17,849 --> 00:40:20,708
Buck, he's a good little actor.

434
00:40:20,873 --> 00:40:24,822
He was the Cheshire Cat in the
"Alice in Wonderland" show that he did.

435
00:40:24,823 --> 00:40:26,412
And he was hilarious.

436
00:40:26,579 --> 00:40:31,545
<i>He may not be what you're looking for,
but I don't think we're gonna get any better.</i>

437
00:40:52,701 --> 00:40:56,112
All right, guys,
fill out the signing sheet.

438
00:40:56,152 --> 00:41:01,010
Name, telephone number,
any acting experience you might have.

439
00:41:01,011 --> 00:41:03,811
And, uh...
I'll need you headshots, please.

440
00:41:03,861 --> 00:41:05,295
What if... What if I got no agent?

441
00:41:05,296 --> 00:41:08,699
Well, just fill in your telephone number.

442
00:41:08,720 --> 00:41:12,500
What if your phone is out of order?

443
00:41:16,019 --> 00:41:18,134
"I know who you are".

444
00:41:18,135 --> 00:41:21,410
"You fooled Hank, but
you haven't fooled me".

445
00:41:21,533 --> 00:41:26,380
"Don't you see, Hank? Are you
too blind to see what's in front of you?"

446
00:41:26,381 --> 00:41:30,014
"I know who you are and you foolen ham,
but you haven't foolen me".

447
00:41:30,015 --> 00:41:33,344
<i>"You put that course on me".</i>

448
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,479
"Don't you remember anything?"

449
00:41:35,480 --> 00:41:38,906
"She's evil, Hank! Evil!"

450
00:41:38,907 --> 00:41:41,729
Now, in this scene, you were playing...

451
00:41:41,730 --> 00:41:43,375
Hank's girlfriend, Delilah.

452
00:41:43,376 --> 00:41:47,531
She's sweet, loving,
fun whenever Hank's around.

453
00:41:47,532 --> 00:41:49,332
But Frank sees you right through you.

454
00:41:49,333 --> 00:41:51,042
OK.

455
00:41:51,251 --> 00:41:53,056
"I don't know
what you're talking about, Frank".

456
00:41:53,057 --> 00:41:56,219
"You were Hank's friend and
I felt sorry for you".

457
00:41:56,253 --> 00:41:59,141
"But I won't stand for this
and Hank won't either".

458
00:41:59,142 --> 00:42:00,942
"So, unless you want
to go back to that hellhole,

459
00:42:00,943 --> 00:42:03,343
I suggest you clean up your act".

460
00:42:03,610 --> 00:42:05,494
Very nice, thank you.

461
00:42:05,592 --> 00:42:08,554
My name is Adam,
I'm reading for Hank.

462
00:42:09,105 --> 00:42:11,150
I see.

463
00:42:12,344 --> 00:42:15,801
"I'm your friend
and I would do anything for you".

464
00:42:15,899 --> 00:42:19,594
"But I know my wife
and she wouldn't hurt a fly".

465
00:42:19,680 --> 00:42:22,530
"I'm going out,
but when I get back,

466
00:42:22,531 --> 00:42:25,395
"I hope you'll make things right".

467
00:42:25,450 --> 00:42:27,475
<i>"I'm telling you the truth, she's a witch!"</i>

468
00:42:27,476 --> 00:42:29,001
"Frank,

469
00:42:29,352 --> 00:42:31,581
<i>"do it for me".</i>

470
00:42:31,811 --> 00:42:32,876
Thank you.

471
00:42:32,977 --> 00:42:35,973
Thank you very much.

472
00:42:38,969 --> 00:42:40,973
Hi, how you're doin'?

473
00:42:42,346 --> 00:42:45,589
Sam, is it?
- Yeah.

474
00:42:46,517 --> 00:42:50,556
Where... where are you from?
- All over... New Jersey.

475
00:42:51,591 --> 00:42:55,148
You've been acting long?
- Nah, some commercials.

476
00:42:55,149 --> 00:42:57,563
<i>"Mountain Deux", some others.</i>

477
00:42:57,699 --> 00:43:00,632
<i>Well, OK.
Go ahead.</i>

478
00:43:03,038 --> 00:43:06,004
"Frank, you're my friend
and I would do anything for you".

479
00:43:06,005 --> 00:43:09,318
"But I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".

480
00:43:09,479 --> 00:43:11,438
"And now you've really hurt her".

481
00:43:11,474 --> 00:43:14,946
OK... Now, Hank is really upset.

482
00:43:14,947 --> 00:43:16,245
He's had it up to here.

483
00:43:16,246 --> 00:43:19,280
<i>You think you could try it a little bit more...?</i>

484
00:43:19,281 --> 00:43:21,000
<i>Like, really mad?
- Exactly.</i>

485
00:43:24,967 --> 00:43:29,603
"Frank, you're my friend
and I would do anything for you".

486
00:43:29,690 --> 00:43:33,575
"But I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".

487
00:43:33,715 --> 00:43:35,736
"And now you've really hurt her".

488
00:43:35,811 --> 00:43:38,075
"I can't stand to see you like this".

489
00:43:38,173 --> 00:43:40,984
"I'm going out now, but when I get back...

490
00:43:40,985 --> 00:43:42,271
"I hope you'll make things right".

491
00:43:42,272 --> 00:43:44,150
<i>"I'm telling you the truth, she's a witch".</i>

492
00:43:44,151 --> 00:43:46,238
"Frank, do it for me!"

493
00:43:46,239 --> 00:43:48,984
<i>Great, thanks, you're coming in.</i>

494
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,394
Yeah, that felt better.

495
00:43:55,290 --> 00:43:56,213
Here.

496
00:43:56,216 --> 00:43:58,232
Oh, hey.

497
00:43:58,233 --> 00:43:59,267
Wow!

498
00:44:00,562 --> 00:44:02,473
Thanks.

499
00:44:04,391 --> 00:44:08,672
Well, now we have left to do is
to decide on Hank.

500
00:44:08,743 --> 00:44:11,997
And I think it's pretty obvious
who we should go with.

501
00:44:12,042 --> 00:44:14,168
No, I like this guy.

502
00:44:15,701 --> 00:44:17,766
You're kidding, right?

503
00:44:18,159 --> 00:44:21,542
Like, he was the worst thing
we saw today. He can't act.

504
00:44:21,612 --> 00:44:23,506
I thought he was all right.

505
00:44:23,516 --> 00:44:25,463
Buck... No!

506
00:44:25,520 --> 00:44:28,431
He can't act at all!

507
00:44:29,764 --> 00:44:30,732
No!

508
00:44:31,392 --> 00:44:35,324
I mean, no.
He is a moron.

509
00:44:41,050 --> 00:44:42,322
I think - him.

510
00:44:42,415 --> 00:44:44,451
Oh, my God!

511
00:44:45,489 --> 00:44:47,476
Oh, shit...

512
00:44:47,853 --> 00:44:49,891
<i>Hello, is Charlie there?</i>

513
00:44:49,892 --> 00:44:51,623
Hi, Buck.

514
00:44:51,728 --> 00:44:52,787
<i>Hi.</i>

515
00:44:54,286 --> 00:44:56,986
I'm sorry, he's not in.
I'll have him call you, OK?

516
00:44:56,987 --> 00:44:59,087
<i>Did you tell him it was important?</i>

517
00:44:59,088 --> 00:45:03,752
Yep, I've told him, but
he's really busy. OK? Goodbye.

518
00:45:04,462 --> 00:45:08,401
I wish he could just, like,
do his job. - Exactly.

519
00:45:08,652 --> 00:45:10,640
Jamila?

520
00:45:10,971 --> 00:45:12,936
Can I talk to you?

521
00:45:13,060 --> 00:45:15,028
Just for a second.

522
00:45:17,412 --> 00:45:21,141
OK, yeah,
I'll see you guys there.

523
00:45:24,683 --> 00:45:27,264
He's there, isn't he?

524
00:45:27,441 --> 00:45:31,424
He could call me back,
he just doesn't want to.

525
00:45:32,028 --> 00:45:33,307
Maybe...

526
00:45:33,321 --> 00:45:35,603
I mean... I don't...
I don't really know.

527
00:45:41,226 --> 00:45:44,272
What's the matter?
- No, no.

528
00:45:44,273 --> 00:45:46,603
Just don't, forget it.

529
00:45:46,704 --> 00:45:48,104
<i>Just...</i>

530
00:45:48,605 --> 00:45:50,605
Whatever.

531
00:46:02,859 --> 00:46:04,018
Hello?

532
00:46:04,199 --> 00:46:05,586
Buck?

533
00:46:05,983 --> 00:46:07,532
<i>Hi.</i>

534
00:46:07,625 --> 00:46:10,530
You really freaked out
my assistant today.

535
00:46:10,971 --> 00:46:12,531
I did?

536
00:46:12,795 --> 00:46:16,723
Look, I'm sorry your mother died
and I know that we were really good friends...

537
00:46:16,724 --> 00:46:17,571
<i>once.</i>

538
00:46:17,572 --> 00:46:19,504
We were best friends.

539
00:46:19,505 --> 00:46:22,579
Right, but that was a long time ago.

540
00:46:22,729 --> 00:46:26,457
My life is really complicated right now,
you know. I got a ton of work...

541
00:46:26,458 --> 00:46:27,458
<i>and I'm getting married.</i>

542
00:46:27,459 --> 00:46:29,624
It's because of her, huh?

543
00:46:30,096 --> 00:46:31,212
<i>Carlyn?</i>

544
00:46:31,259 --> 00:46:32,785
She doesn't like me.

545
00:46:32,786 --> 00:46:35,489
<i>She does like you, OK?
It's not her.</i>

546
00:46:35,490 --> 00:46:36,542
A lot has changed.

547
00:46:36,543 --> 00:46:39,590
I can't deal with it, I'm not
the same person anymore.

548
00:46:41,591 --> 00:46:43,887
What do you mean?

549
00:46:45,677 --> 00:46:49,626
<i>I don't know why you've...
fixated on me.</i>

550
00:46:52,222 --> 00:46:54,416
<i>Yes, you do.</i>

551
00:46:57,803 --> 00:46:59,971
Look, don't call.

552
00:47:00,050 --> 00:47:02,263
Don't call me at home,
don't call me at the office,

553
00:47:02,264 --> 00:47:04,113
don't stop by unannounced.

554
00:47:04,114 --> 00:47:06,498
Just stay away.

555
00:47:10,011 --> 00:47:11,842
<i>"He's not gonna wake up, Frank".</i>

556
00:47:11,932 --> 00:47:13,485
<i>"It's only bad luck if it drops in the mud".</i>

557
00:47:13,486 --> 00:47:16,471
"Says who?"
- "Says everybody".

558
00:47:17,052 --> 00:47:19,209
"Take the shovel and start digging".

559
00:47:19,210 --> 00:47:22,262
<i>"Find the place where the ground is soft".</i>

560
00:47:27,712 --> 00:47:29,975
Hey.
- Hey.

561
00:47:30,648 --> 00:47:32,806
So, you wrote this?

562
00:47:33,070 --> 00:47:36,183
Yeah.
- How long did it take?

563
00:47:36,469 --> 00:47:40,252
A few days.
- A few days, huh?

564
00:47:40,381 --> 00:47:43,428
That's all?
It's pretty good.

565
00:47:43,580 --> 00:47:45,278
Thanks.
- Hey, don't thank me.

566
00:47:45,279 --> 00:47:48,273
Thank you.
You wrote a fantastic play.

567
00:47:56,463 --> 00:47:59,477
I'll see you later.
- Yeah, all right.

568
00:48:02,706 --> 00:48:04,778
Take care.

569
00:48:06,747 --> 00:48:09,224
Pick a color.
- Green.

570
00:48:09,371 --> 00:48:11,881
G, R, E, E, N.

571
00:48:11,908 --> 00:48:14,282
Pick a number.
- Seven.

572
00:48:14,283 --> 00:48:16,683
You already picked seven.

573
00:48:16,876 --> 00:48:18,837
Eleven.

574
00:48:20,467 --> 00:48:24,388
"You will live with the
movie stars in Beverly Hills"

575
00:48:24,449 --> 00:48:27,853
Yep, that's me.
- Have you ever played this game?

576
00:48:28,053 --> 00:48:29,356
Yeah.

577
00:48:29,490 --> 00:48:32,464
Listen, about the script...

578
00:48:32,544 --> 00:48:36,565
I see it as a love story
between Hank and Frank.

579
00:48:37,519 --> 00:48:41,094
You do?
- Yeah, don't you?

580
00:48:41,150 --> 00:48:45,601
It's like a homo-erotic
misoginistic love story.

581
00:48:48,542 --> 00:48:51,370
Well, it is what it is.

582
00:48:51,371 --> 00:48:53,148
I don't know.

583
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:55,867
I mean, I wanted to write something like...

584
00:48:55,929 --> 00:48:58,873
like... like the kind of things
me and my friend used to do.

585
00:48:58,874 --> 00:49:02,383
Let me do a beat-by-beat
analysis of the play, OK?

586
00:49:02,410 --> 00:49:03,754
OK.

587
00:49:03,942 --> 00:49:08,453
"Hank and Frank" are this
"Waiting for Godot" little duo.

588
00:49:08,540 --> 00:49:11,610
They're in the forest,
it's like paradise.

589
00:49:11,611 --> 00:49:15,572
Right. - This horrible
wicked witch woman appears...

590
00:49:15,573 --> 00:49:17,593
They traspassed.

591
00:49:17,715 --> 00:49:20,291
She casts a spell on both of them.

592
00:49:20,292 --> 00:49:22,759
And makes Hank stupid.

593
00:49:22,853 --> 00:49:25,590
And she turns Frank into a cripple.

594
00:49:25,618 --> 00:49:27,843
Which is like castration.

595
00:49:27,844 --> 00:49:29,858
She castrates him.

596
00:49:31,461 --> 00:49:33,927
What do you mean?
- Like, she...

597
00:49:33,928 --> 00:49:36,983
takes his penis away.

598
00:49:38,840 --> 00:49:41,844
What TV shows do you watch?

599
00:49:42,742 --> 00:49:45,151
What TV shows do I watch?

600
00:49:45,251 --> 00:49:48,664
It's like a fairytale, you know,
it's like "Goldielocks"...

601
00:49:48,665 --> 00:49:51,261
or, uh... "Little Red Ridinghood".

602
00:49:51,370 --> 00:49:55,303
You know, there's some kids,
and a witch and a curse and...

603
00:50:00,250 --> 00:50:01,619
<i>Hello?</i>

604
00:50:02,187 --> 00:50:03,636
Hello?

605
00:50:07,306 --> 00:50:10,119
Who was it?
- You know who it is.

606
00:50:10,297 --> 00:50:14,230
It's Buck. He calls every
15 minutes and hangs up on me.

607
00:50:15,379 --> 00:50:17,341
What's the deal?

608
00:50:19,238 --> 00:50:21,264
Uh... he's crazy.

609
00:50:21,892 --> 00:50:23,332
Was he always like this or...?

610
00:50:23,333 --> 00:50:26,320
Yeah, and his parents were nuts.

611
00:50:27,021 --> 00:50:31,437
I feel sorry for him,
his Mom just died...

612
00:50:31,830 --> 00:50:35,466
But don't worry,
he'll stop calling eventually.

613
00:50:35,474 --> 00:50:38,043
<i>You're starting to feel the poison.</i>

614
00:50:38,044 --> 00:50:41,910
You get on your knees
and you stumble across towards Frank.

615
00:50:41,911 --> 00:50:44,503
Now, Delilah, you stand between them.

616
00:50:44,504 --> 00:50:47,304
I don't think she should be
standing there. - Why not?

617
00:50:47,307 --> 00:50:49,263
Unless you want me to hit her.

618
00:50:49,322 --> 00:50:53,036
She's fucking killed me.
I'm not gonna just pass by:

619
00:50:53,037 --> 00:50:55,053
"Oh, hey! Hi, how you're doin'?"

620
00:50:55,125 --> 00:50:57,402
But you're weak with the poison.

621
00:50:57,403 --> 00:50:59,420
I'm not that weak.

622
00:50:59,768 --> 00:51:02,723
What if she stands over there?

623
00:51:03,120 --> 00:51:06,274
Uh-uh, I could still easily
pop her with my hand.

624
00:51:06,368 --> 00:51:09,898
<i>"I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".</i>

625
00:51:09,899 --> 00:51:11,331
I think we're fuckin' doomed, man.

626
00:51:11,332 --> 00:51:13,205
I know I'm not inviting my agent.

627
00:51:13,206 --> 00:51:16,374
You're not?
- No! Fuck, no.

628
00:51:16,528 --> 00:51:18,476
Can you keep it simple?

629
00:51:18,551 --> 00:51:22,037
See, what I don't understand
is less anger.

630
00:51:22,038 --> 00:51:23,746
I mean, I don't think I'm angry enough.

631
00:51:23,747 --> 00:51:27,028
<i>What I mean is, you can
show anger without screaming.</i>

632
00:51:27,329 --> 00:51:29,376
Just pull it down a bit.

633
00:51:29,377 --> 00:51:33,200
You know that, when you're angry...
you raise your voice.

634
00:51:33,201 --> 00:51:35,232
You know that?

635
00:51:35,847 --> 00:51:37,856
Try it...

636
00:51:38,023 --> 00:51:40,077
without screaming.

637
00:51:44,138 --> 00:51:47,440
"I know my wife
and she couldn't hurt a fly".

638
00:51:47,441 --> 00:51:50,453
"Now you've really hurt her".

639
00:52:35,818 --> 00:52:38,191
Sadie! Sadie!

640
00:52:41,729 --> 00:52:43,701
She won't come.

641
00:52:46,779 --> 00:52:48,329
You want a blow-pop?

642
00:52:48,451 --> 00:52:50,208
Mom!

643
00:52:50,769 --> 00:52:52,779
Mom!

644
00:52:54,106 --> 00:52:57,139
Can I have a blow-pop?
- No, your lunch is almost ready.

645
00:52:57,140 --> 00:52:59,241
Come on, please!
- No!

646
00:53:06,461 --> 00:53:08,928
Here, you can have a lick of mine.

647
00:53:11,388 --> 00:53:13,325
Mom says they'll rot my teeth out.

648
00:53:15,102 --> 00:53:17,351
I eat them all the time and look.

649
00:53:19,905 --> 00:53:22,415
This is top secret stuff, OK?
- OK.

650
00:53:22,873 --> 00:53:24,221
Nobody knows about this.

651
00:53:28,682 --> 00:53:31,356
Look, black catch.

652
00:53:31,592 --> 00:53:34,153
I tried to stick one on Sadie's butt.

653
00:53:34,154 --> 00:53:36,125
Sadie hates me.

654
00:53:37,877 --> 00:53:39,588
Let's light one off.

655
00:53:39,610 --> 00:53:41,187
OK.

656
00:53:41,973 --> 00:53:45,738
Oh! Oh!
Oh, my God! Mommy!

657
00:53:45,893 --> 00:53:47,132
Mommy, help!

658
00:53:47,656 --> 00:53:48,807
Oh, shit!

659
00:53:48,858 --> 00:53:49,844
What?

660
00:53:49,954 --> 00:53:52,909
Help!
- Oh, my God! Tommy!

661
00:53:53,044 --> 00:53:54,082
What happened?

662
00:53:54,175 --> 00:53:56,707
He had some firecrackers.

663
00:53:58,238 --> 00:54:00,400
Keep working, guys, OK?

664
00:54:00,471 --> 00:54:03,865
I need to talk to you.
What happened yesterday?

665
00:54:03,905 --> 00:54:04,912
When?

666
00:54:04,913 --> 00:54:06,520
With Tommy, yesterday.

667
00:54:06,690 --> 00:54:10,588
Well, he set off a firecracker
and he burnt his hand.

668
00:54:10,674 --> 00:54:13,845
Yes, and his mother is freaking out.

669
00:54:13,846 --> 00:54:15,710
She's pulling him out of the play.

670
00:54:15,711 --> 00:54:19,033
She is? - She's pulling him
out of both plays.

671
00:54:19,034 --> 00:54:21,541
And Barry is totally pissed off at me.

672
00:54:21,542 --> 00:54:24,562
Hell, why didn't you stop him?

673
00:54:26,265 --> 00:54:29,654
I don't know.
- Buck, when you're around kids,

674
00:54:29,655 --> 00:54:31,484
you need to protect them!

675
00:54:31,530 --> 00:54:34,550
Remember, you're an adult.

676
00:54:34,635 --> 00:54:36,576
I know it doesn't give you much time.

677
00:54:36,577 --> 00:54:40,551
But our backs are against the wall.
So what do you think?

678
00:54:42,050 --> 00:54:44,016
It's fine with me.

679
00:54:45,328 --> 00:54:48,530
Now, uh... Would we be
playing it like little kids, like a...

680
00:54:48,799 --> 00:54:50,279
like... like...

681
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:53,392
"La-la-la, I'm a little kid?"

682
00:54:54,248 --> 00:54:57,821
Well, you wouldn't be playing it
like a little retarded kid.

683
00:54:57,822 --> 00:55:00,819
But yes, you would be acting youthfull.

684
00:55:03,251 --> 00:55:05,127
Fine, all right.

685
00:55:05,128 --> 00:55:07,157
I'll do it.

686
00:55:09,752 --> 00:55:11,269
Charlie Sitter's office.

687
00:55:11,371 --> 00:55:14,576
<i>Hello? This is, uh... Bob...</i>

688
00:55:14,722 --> 00:55:16,982
<i>Double... berg.</i>

689
00:55:18,635 --> 00:55:19,895
<i>Charlie, Bob Doubleberg.</i>

690
00:55:19,896 --> 00:55:20,778
Who?

691
00:55:20,779 --> 00:55:22,991
<i>He says he's returning your call.</i>

692
00:55:22,992 --> 00:55:24,279
Take a number.

693
00:55:30,338 --> 00:55:31,118
Hello?

694
00:55:31,376 --> 00:55:32,362
Hello.

695
00:55:32,363 --> 00:55:34,328
<i>Hey Chuck, it's Buck.</i>

696
00:55:35,129 --> 00:55:38,114
I didn't think you would
return my call, so...

697
00:55:38,685 --> 00:55:40,692
<i>What do you want, Buck?</i>

698
00:55:41,345 --> 00:55:43,526
Well, the play that I wrote...

699
00:55:43,527 --> 00:55:46,045
They're putting it on
a week from Monday and...

700
00:55:46,046 --> 00:55:47,746
<i>I was hoping you could come.</i>

701
00:55:47,836 --> 00:55:49,714
I don't know, Buck, I don't...

702
00:55:49,715 --> 00:55:51,910
I think you might wanna see it.

703
00:55:51,928 --> 00:55:53,924
You know, it's a...

704
00:55:54,024 --> 00:55:56,171
It would mean a lot to me.

705
00:55:56,801 --> 00:55:58,656
<i>It's at the "Aeternus" theatre.</i>

706
00:55:58,657 --> 00:56:01,659
<i>It's right across the street from your office.</i>

707
00:56:02,021 --> 00:56:04,183
<i>You know?
It's not that great of play,</i>

708
00:56:04,184 --> 00:56:07,112
<i>but I think you might like it.</i>

709
00:56:09,445 --> 00:56:12,546
<i>Buck, I gotta go off the phone,
I got another call.</i>

710
00:56:12,592 --> 00:56:14,471
<i>Thanks for letting me know, OK?
I'll see what I can do.</i>

711
00:56:14,472 --> 00:56:17,630
Chuck, please come, OK?

712
00:56:18,025 --> 00:56:20,298
"You gotta understand, Delilah..."

713
00:56:21,887 --> 00:56:22,816
Line.

714
00:56:23,640 --> 00:56:25,692
"Things have been hard for Frank".

715
00:56:27,471 --> 00:56:29,462
"Things have been hard for Frank".

716
00:56:30,101 --> 00:56:31,216
What is it?

717
00:56:31,267 --> 00:56:33,683
"He's been wandering the forest for years".

718
00:56:34,381 --> 00:56:36,293
"He's been wandering the forest for years".

719
00:56:37,695 --> 00:56:40,651
Nah.
Can I hold my script?

720
00:56:40,849 --> 00:56:43,816
If that's what you need.

721
00:56:44,036 --> 00:56:46,140
<i>I feel like I'm in 7th grade.</i>

722
00:56:46,141 --> 00:56:49,099
<i>I'm crammin' for this test
and I'm gonna fail.</i>

723
00:56:51,108 --> 00:56:53,128
Sweet.

724
00:56:54,675 --> 00:56:56,687
Look at this shit.

725
00:56:57,266 --> 00:57:00,021
It's like a fuckin' Romper room here.

726
00:57:00,050 --> 00:57:03,659
Yeah.
- It's all kids stuff.

727
00:57:06,083 --> 00:57:08,180
Look at this shit.

728
00:57:10,265 --> 00:57:12,591
Is that your Mom and Pops?

729
00:57:12,663 --> 00:57:15,500
Yeah.
- Where are they?

730
00:57:15,821 --> 00:57:17,078
Oh, they're dead.

731
00:57:17,079 --> 00:57:19,179
Oh, whoops!

732
00:57:19,262 --> 00:57:24,530
That's too bad...
Why do you live in a motel?

733
00:57:25,443 --> 00:57:27,416
Where should I live?
- I don't know. You know,

734
00:57:27,417 --> 00:57:30,839
apartment, condo.
Hey, you want one?

735
00:57:33,628 --> 00:57:35,331
Here you go.

736
00:57:45,489 --> 00:57:47,298
There's something funny about you.

737
00:57:47,299 --> 00:57:49,279
You're funny, huh?
- Maybe.

738
00:57:49,280 --> 00:57:51,304
People used to say I'm funny.
I mean...

739
00:57:51,494 --> 00:57:54,991
They say: "Sam, you're funny,
you should be an actor".

740
00:57:54,992 --> 00:57:58,560
I didn't want to be an actor 'n' nuthin',
but, you know, people kept saying that.

741
00:57:58,561 --> 00:57:59,911
And I was like: "Well,

742
00:58:00,060 --> 00:58:03,570
"it beats land-fucking-carpet".

743
00:58:03,843 --> 00:58:06,531
<i>OK, I gotta try that part again. OK?</i>

744
00:58:06,553 --> 00:58:08,939
<i>"There won't be dark for hours".</i>

745
00:58:09,026 --> 00:58:11,698
<i>"Yeah, Frank,
the cookie sounds good to me".</i>

746
00:58:11,748 --> 00:58:14,873
"I don't know Hank, I don't trust her".

747
00:58:14,964 --> 00:58:17,751
What's the line?
- "Come on, don't be a chicken".

748
00:58:17,752 --> 00:58:20,184
"Come on, don't be a chicken".
- "I'm not a chicken..."

749
00:58:20,185 --> 00:58:23,426
All right, all right, that's enough,
my head's spinning.

750
00:58:23,476 --> 00:58:26,287
I don't know...
I don't know about that chick.

751
00:58:26,288 --> 00:58:28,655
Who, Beverly?
- Yeah, Beverly.

752
00:58:28,656 --> 00:58:30,291
I think she's got problems.

753
00:58:30,349 --> 00:58:35,508
I mean, I think she wished she had a cock.
You know what I'm sayin'?

754
00:58:35,628 --> 00:58:38,884
Well, she's all right.
- Yeah, she's all right.

755
00:58:38,976 --> 00:58:43,563
I hate her fuckin'... I don't know...
I wonder what her twat looks like.

756
00:58:43,679 --> 00:58:48,556
You ever wonder that? It's like,
sometime she'll be talkin' to me,

757
00:58:48,654 --> 00:58:50,473
<i>and all I can think is,
what's her twat look like.</i>

758
00:58:50,510 --> 00:58:53,506
<i>"Why don't you show it to me,
you fuckin' bitch?"</i>

759
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:57,405
Yeah... I'm twisted.

760
00:58:57,501 --> 00:59:01,506
I got problems, I know I do.

761
00:59:05,769 --> 00:59:08,576
You look like this friend of mine.
- Yeah?

762
00:59:08,670 --> 00:59:11,694
That's cool.
- My best friend.

763
00:59:17,166 --> 00:59:19,147
I'm nervous.

764
00:59:20,397 --> 00:59:22,740
Nervous? About what?

765
00:59:22,877 --> 00:59:25,351
I don't think my friend
is gonna come to the play.

766
00:59:25,352 --> 00:59:29,038
Why not? - I don't think he
wants to be my friend anymore.

767
00:59:29,125 --> 00:59:30,387
Why not?

768
00:59:30,478 --> 00:59:32,490
I don't know.

769
00:59:32,874 --> 00:59:34,805
Because...

770
00:59:35,665 --> 00:59:37,073
I'm not normal.

771
00:59:37,074 --> 00:59:39,905
Hey, Buck, you're normal.

772
00:59:40,237 --> 00:59:43,267
But I know if he saw the play,

773
00:59:43,738 --> 00:59:46,821
he'd remember
the way things used to be...

774
00:59:46,822 --> 00:59:48,899
with us and all the things we did.

775
00:59:50,158 --> 00:59:52,382
I think he'd changed his
mind about me, you know.

776
00:59:52,422 --> 00:59:56,010
Hey, the least this guy can do
is get off his ass and come see it.

777
00:59:56,011 --> 00:59:59,046
I mean, come on,
you just gotta make him come.

778
01:00:02,730 --> 01:00:04,228
Take care.
- You too.

779
01:00:04,229 --> 01:00:06,287
I'll see you soon.
- Tomorrow, right?

780
01:00:06,288 --> 01:00:07,335
Yeah.

781
01:00:09,937 --> 01:00:12,039
Hey.
- Oh, my God! Buck!

782
01:00:12,040 --> 01:00:14,356
I'm sorry.
- You scared me.

783
01:00:14,357 --> 01:00:16,702
Sorry, I... I was gonna
call you, but, you know...

784
01:00:16,703 --> 01:00:18,129
your phone's been disconnected.

785
01:00:18,130 --> 01:00:20,834
Yeah, well... Someone kept
calling us and hanging up.

786
01:00:20,835 --> 01:00:24,593
Yeah... Well, um...
I wanted to tell you about my play.

787
01:00:24,683 --> 01:00:28,299
See, I have this play and, um...
they're doing a performance of it.

788
01:00:28,300 --> 01:00:30,875
You do? - Yeah, Monday...
Monday night at 8:00.

789
01:00:30,876 --> 01:00:34,917
And I... I told Chuck about it...
but I'm just... I'm not sure if he, um...

790
01:00:34,918 --> 01:00:38,084
he's gonna...

791
01:00:38,471 --> 01:00:42,515
Where is it? - Uh, it's...
It's at the "Aeternus" theatre.

792
01:00:45,008 --> 01:00:46,293
Well, we'll try to be there.

793
01:00:46,294 --> 01:00:49,794
It sounds... illuminating.

794
01:00:53,908 --> 01:00:55,976
Are you ready?

795
01:00:57,437 --> 01:01:01,064
Um, you know... Could we just
blow it off? I'm kind of tired.

796
01:01:01,130 --> 01:01:03,105
You wanna blow it off?

797
01:01:06,008 --> 01:01:08,748
Well, I'm going.
- You don't have to be nice.

798
01:01:08,749 --> 01:01:10,908
<i>I wanna see it, I'm curious.</i>

799
01:01:12,345 --> 01:01:14,316
Are you coming or not?

800
01:01:37,205 --> 01:01:40,287
Hey, Tommy, how's your hand?
- Fine.

801
01:01:44,533 --> 01:01:46,679
Can I have these two seats
for my sister?

802
01:01:46,680 --> 01:01:49,513
No.
- I need them.

803
01:01:49,514 --> 01:01:52,543
I don't care, they're saved.

804
01:02:13,904 --> 01:02:15,937
Hey, hey.
- Hey, Buck.

805
01:02:15,938 --> 01:02:18,836
Hey.
- They almost took your seats.

806
01:02:18,876 --> 01:02:20,889
Come on.
- All right.

807
01:02:26,903 --> 01:02:28,807
So, uh...

808
01:02:28,866 --> 01:02:31,872
here are your seats.

809
01:02:40,746 --> 01:02:42,006
Hey.

810
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:45,831
OK. Well, I'll see you
after the show. - OK.

811
01:02:54,347 --> 01:02:55,923
Get up, Buddy.

812
01:02:55,980 --> 01:02:57,358
Come on.

813
01:02:57,494 --> 01:03:01,495
Wake up, Buddy.
- He's not gonna wake up, Frank.

814
01:03:03,101 --> 01:03:05,188
Come on, Buddy.

815
01:03:06,338 --> 01:03:08,385
He's dead, Frank!

816
01:03:08,699 --> 01:03:11,303
<i>You've been sitting there for hours.</i>

817
01:03:11,350 --> 01:03:12,940
<i>He's not gonna wake up.</i>

818
01:03:12,973 --> 01:03:14,965
You don't even care.

819
01:03:14,981 --> 01:03:16,607
Buddy is dead!

820
01:03:16,608 --> 01:03:18,458
Ah, it's not such a big deal.

821
01:03:18,459 --> 01:03:22,670
Easy for you to say,
it's not your dog.

822
01:03:22,764 --> 01:03:24,872
<i>Forget about the dog, Frank.</i>

823
01:03:25,089 --> 01:03:27,278
<i>I wanna go into the forest and play.</i>

824
01:03:27,279 --> 01:03:29,956
<i>I love playing with you.</i>

825
01:03:30,120 --> 01:03:32,846
<i>And today I'm gonna show you
a new game.</i>

826
01:03:32,952 --> 01:03:35,275
Mmm, cookies...

827
01:03:35,276 --> 01:03:36,376
Yumm...

828
01:03:36,464 --> 01:03:40,130
Yeah, Frank,
a cookie sounds good to me.

829
01:03:40,268 --> 01:03:42,939
I don't know, Hank,
I don't trust her.

830
01:03:43,067 --> 01:03:45,542
<i>I know what you two
have been doing in the forest!</i>

831
01:03:45,543 --> 01:03:48,312
<i>And you've been very bad!</i>

832
01:03:48,313 --> 01:03:50,400
<i>Now eat these cookies!</i>

833
01:03:50,549 --> 01:03:53,676
<i>You keep talking and talking...</i>

834
01:03:53,707 --> 01:03:55,485
<i>and talking about that night.</i>

835
01:03:55,486 --> 01:03:56,695
<i>But I don't remember.</i>

836
01:03:56,696 --> 01:03:59,139
It's because she put a curse on you.

837
01:03:59,140 --> 01:04:03,457
She put a curse on both of us,
she made me the cripple that I am today.

838
01:04:03,532 --> 01:04:05,156
<i>Delilah is a witch.</i>

839
01:04:05,157 --> 01:04:08,223
<i>My wife, Delilah?</i>

840
01:04:09,763 --> 01:04:13,857
You can both go to doggy heaven,
for all I care.

841
01:04:18,064 --> 01:04:21,348
<i>I'm sorry, Frank,
I should've believed you.</i>

842
01:04:21,412 --> 01:04:25,437
<i>And now it's too late.
We came into this mud together,</i>

843
01:04:26,129 --> 01:04:30,165
now we're gonna die together.
You were right all along.

844
01:04:30,614 --> 01:04:33,153
<i>I shouldn't have made you
eat those cookies.</i>

845
01:04:33,228 --> 01:04:37,324
<i>You were younger than me.
I shouldn't have done that to you.</i>

846
01:04:37,478 --> 01:04:39,439
<i>But it's because I love you.</i>

847
01:04:39,535 --> 01:04:41,894
<i>I'm sorry, Frank.</i>

848
01:04:41,933 --> 01:04:43,908
<i>I love you.</i>

849
01:05:01,072 --> 01:05:02,871
I'm sorry man, I fucked up.

850
01:05:02,872 --> 01:05:05,167
I thought I was gonna shit my pants
out there, I really did.

851
01:05:05,168 --> 01:05:08,769
That's okay, thanks.

852
01:05:14,010 --> 01:05:15,045
Hey.

853
01:05:16,541 --> 01:05:19,989
Charlie, tell Buck
what you thought of his play.

854
01:05:20,039 --> 01:05:21,235
Charlie?

855
01:05:25,018 --> 01:05:29,308
We're having a cast party,
you guys should stay.

856
01:05:32,435 --> 01:05:35,684
Are you sure
you can't stay for a minute?

857
01:05:36,417 --> 01:05:38,023
Hey, we did it!

858
01:05:49,033 --> 01:05:51,179
<i>I need to know what's going on.
- There's nothing going on.</i>

859
01:05:51,180 --> 01:05:55,595
There's something going on!
- You were the one who's felt sorry for.

860
01:05:55,673 --> 01:05:58,613
I told you he's fucking crazy.

861
01:06:03,440 --> 01:06:05,825
Barry liked the play.

862
01:06:05,862 --> 01:06:09,704
And he's asked me to direct
"Chitty Chitty, Bang, Bang"...

863
01:06:09,705 --> 01:06:13,146
in February. Isn't it great?

864
01:06:13,450 --> 01:06:15,526
We're taking off now.

865
01:06:15,603 --> 01:06:18,239
Hey... Congratulations!

866
01:06:18,443 --> 01:06:21,242
See ya.
- Good work, Sam.

867
01:06:21,460 --> 01:06:23,222
You made it out alive.

868
01:06:23,300 --> 01:06:25,363
Good night, guys.

869
01:06:37,495 --> 01:06:40,479
My friend came.

870
01:06:41,365 --> 01:06:45,577
He didn't liked it.
- I'm sure he liked it.

871
01:06:46,808 --> 01:06:49,329
Oh, what does he know?

872
01:06:54,401 --> 01:06:57,118
<i>You like this place?
- Yeah.</i>

873
01:06:57,211 --> 01:06:59,638
You know, you should
move in across the hall.

874
01:06:59,785 --> 01:07:03,533
It's my fuckin' bitch neighbour,
she just moved out.

875
01:07:03,685 --> 01:07:05,388
This chick is from hell, man.

876
01:07:05,389 --> 01:07:09,528
I couldn't play my music,
I couldn't party in the hall...

877
01:07:09,646 --> 01:07:11,530
One day she couldn't take it anymore...

878
01:07:11,682 --> 01:07:15,279
She just starts cryin',
called me an asshole...

879
01:07:15,350 --> 01:07:18,567
and she moved out.

880
01:07:19,568 --> 01:07:22,968
<i>» I'm so lonesome I could die... «</i>

881
01:07:23,039 --> 01:07:26,070
Don't mess with Sam.

882
01:07:29,571 --> 01:07:33,571
<i>» Well, I don't see you
and it's getting dark... «</i>

883
01:07:33,572 --> 01:07:37,072
<i>» Today we should have gone
to Central Park... «</i>

884
01:07:37,073 --> 01:07:40,573
<i>» Well, don't you wanna
see me ever again? «</i>

885
01:07:40,574 --> 01:07:43,674
<i>» If not, I'll meet you
on the astral plane... «</i>

886
01:07:43,675 --> 01:07:52,475
<i>» Astral plane for late at night,
the astral plane or I'd go insane! «</i>

887
01:07:57,176 --> 01:08:01,076
<i>» Well, we've known each other
from other lives, «</i>

888
01:08:01,077 --> 01:08:08,577
<i>» I want to see you today, but I'll
prove my knowledge of what's inside... «</i>

889
01:08:08,578 --> 01:08:11,578
<i>» When I intercept you
on the astral plane... «</i>

890
01:08:11,579 --> 01:08:20,579
<i>» The astral plane for late at night,
the astral plane or I'll go insane... «</i>

891
01:08:21,160 --> 01:08:23,456
What the fuck!

892
01:08:23,951 --> 01:08:25,378
Oh, man!

893
01:08:25,480 --> 01:08:27,626
What was that?
- I... I was just...

894
01:08:27,627 --> 01:08:29,235
What was that, Buck?

895
01:08:29,314 --> 01:08:30,735
I was gonna sleep over.

896
01:08:30,842 --> 01:08:32,765
Get out of here!
I didn't asked you to grab my cock!

897
01:08:32,766 --> 01:08:35,757
<i>Get the fuck out of here!</i>

898
01:08:36,356 --> 01:08:38,811
Oh, fuck!

899
01:08:50,012 --> 01:08:59,512
<i>» And when we're together,
and I got my friends by my side... «</i>

900
01:08:59,513 --> 01:09:06,113
<i>» When we're together,
there's nothing in the world that I'd lie... «</i>

901
01:09:09,190 --> 01:09:11,222
When we were kids,

902
01:09:11,313 --> 01:09:14,359
we did these things.

903
01:09:14,502 --> 01:09:16,563
<i>What things?</i>

904
01:09:19,206 --> 01:09:22,221
Sex things.

905
01:09:22,475 --> 01:09:25,379
I know all about that.

906
01:09:25,493 --> 01:09:27,506
Kids are kids.

907
01:09:27,628 --> 01:09:31,686
They experiment, it's...
It's completely normal.

908
01:09:35,758 --> 01:09:38,762
What happened, wasn't normal.

909
01:09:39,396 --> 01:09:42,571
You know, Buck,
I'm worried about you.

910
01:09:43,074 --> 01:09:45,596
You've lost your mother.

911
01:09:45,685 --> 01:09:46,729
That's hard.

912
01:09:46,730 --> 01:09:48,944
He started it.

913
01:09:49,118 --> 01:09:51,032
He made me this way.

914
01:09:51,128 --> 01:09:53,342
<i>It was a long time ago.</i>

915
01:09:53,358 --> 01:09:55,548
So?
- So... you need to let go.

916
01:09:55,549 --> 01:09:57,582
You have to create something new.

917
01:09:57,636 --> 01:09:59,822
<i>You don't have to act like I'm crazy.</i>

918
01:09:59,874 --> 01:10:02,794
But the truth is...
I was here...

919
01:10:02,795 --> 01:10:04,483
way before you.

920
01:10:04,484 --> 01:10:07,351
And I know what you are.

921
01:10:08,296 --> 01:10:10,104
You're like his house...

922
01:10:10,279 --> 01:10:11,988
or his car.

923
01:10:12,048 --> 01:10:14,155
That's all.

924
01:10:17,930 --> 01:10:20,963
Chuck and me...

925
01:10:21,492 --> 01:10:23,595
<i>He's all I have.</i>

926
01:10:23,618 --> 01:10:26,659
You don't have him.

927
01:10:27,743 --> 01:10:30,322
<i>Buck, I'm gonna give you
the number of my therapist.</i>

928
01:10:30,451 --> 01:10:32,744
<i>She can recommend someone for you.</i>

929
01:10:32,823 --> 01:10:35,804
<i>I want you to get help.</i>

930
01:10:45,287 --> 01:10:46,715
<i>"Nine Iron Fills Seats"...</i>

931
01:10:46,716 --> 01:10:48,693
it's just the other thing
we're a little worried about.

932
01:10:48,734 --> 01:10:51,173
For "Freudian".
- "Freudian"?

933
01:10:51,174 --> 01:10:53,651
"Freudian" is a great band...
- We can get "Nine Iron" for, let's say...

934
01:10:53,652 --> 01:10:55,362
the L.A. shows...

935
01:10:55,363 --> 01:10:57,121
We would be happy
to work something with "Freudian".

936
01:10:57,122 --> 01:10:59,583
How many shows is there?
- It's two shows.

937
01:10:59,584 --> 01:11:01,353
I got two shows...

938
01:11:01,354 --> 01:11:04,019
It's in town,
it's gonna be really good for us.

939
01:11:04,020 --> 01:11:09,711
And then, maybe... If we give you, like a...
San Francisco... - We're leaving really far in this.

940
01:11:09,750 --> 01:11:15,721
Um... Can you, guys, hold on a minute?
- Sure. - I'll be back in a minute.

941
01:11:18,703 --> 01:11:20,729
You followed me here, didn't you?

942
01:11:20,862 --> 01:11:24,787
I have some things to say to you.
- I don't give a shit!

943
01:11:24,788 --> 01:11:29,262
I've got some promoters here.
I don't have time for you, not now, not ever!

944
01:11:29,327 --> 01:11:32,303
Well, if you want me to leave you alone
then you listen for me for a few minutes.

945
01:11:32,304 --> 01:11:33,630
I have some things to say.

946
01:11:33,631 --> 01:11:36,693
What the fuck was that yesterday?
Was it some kind of joke?

947
01:11:37,217 --> 01:11:39,284
<i>Jesus, Buck, you need help.</i>

948
01:11:39,707 --> 01:11:42,858
You want to order something?
- No!

949
01:11:42,960 --> 01:11:46,924
I have people here. I told you that.
Didn't you hear me?

950
01:11:53,097 --> 01:11:55,858
After I'm finished with them,
I'll have one drink with you.

951
01:11:55,859 --> 01:11:58,138
You can tell me whatever the fuck
it is you have to say.

952
01:11:58,144 --> 01:11:59,801
<i>Jesus, Buck!</i>

953
01:12:05,610 --> 01:12:09,577
Not bad, Charles.
- All right, man.

954
01:12:09,578 --> 01:12:11,078
Good to see you.

955
01:12:11,120 --> 01:12:15,199
I met a friend,
he's over here tonight.

956
01:12:29,440 --> 01:12:33,202
What can I get you?
- Uh... You got Martini?

957
01:12:33,276 --> 01:12:36,246
Rum and Coke.
- OK.

958
01:12:38,468 --> 01:12:40,499
So, talk.

959
01:12:42,428 --> 01:12:44,433
I...

960
01:12:45,102 --> 01:12:48,122
I know that things have changed.

961
01:12:49,402 --> 01:12:51,892
I know that...

962
01:12:51,944 --> 01:12:54,224
things can't be the way they were.

963
01:12:54,376 --> 01:12:57,306
The way they were?
We were eleven years old!

964
01:12:58,333 --> 01:13:01,481
You act like it's weird that I've changed.

965
01:13:01,584 --> 01:13:06,569
<i>Like it's some freak occurance that
I wanna climb trees with you all day.</i>

966
01:13:06,577 --> 01:13:08,418
People don't change.

967
01:13:08,419 --> 01:13:11,226
Yes, they do.
They do, Buck.

968
01:13:11,365 --> 01:13:14,395
Maybe not you, but everybody else.

969
01:13:14,821 --> 01:13:17,760
It's like you've been trapped
in some time capsule.

970
01:13:17,761 --> 01:13:20,794
Why?
What are you afraid of?

971
01:13:29,872 --> 01:13:31,825
Right now,

972
01:13:32,557 --> 01:13:36,573
it's just you and me here.

973
01:13:37,075 --> 01:13:39,148
It's like...

974
01:13:40,611 --> 01:13:42,629
I'm OK.

975
01:13:44,149 --> 01:13:46,603
<i>I know you.</i>

976
01:13:47,157 --> 01:13:50,111
It was me and you.

977
01:13:55,391 --> 01:13:58,385
And all this other stuff...

978
01:13:58,927 --> 01:14:01,225
makes me feel...

979
01:14:01,313 --> 01:14:03,393
dead.

980
01:14:04,495 --> 01:14:07,429
<i>And I don't wanna feel dead.</i>

981
01:14:14,367 --> 01:14:16,343
Thanks.

982
01:14:24,772 --> 01:14:27,709
You want me to go away?

983
01:14:30,825 --> 01:14:33,895
Well, then come home with me tonight.

984
01:14:43,343 --> 01:14:45,393
Just one night.

985
01:14:45,718 --> 01:14:47,753
<i>And then...</i>

986
01:14:48,917 --> 01:14:50,747
I don't know.

987
01:14:50,813 --> 01:14:53,856
You'll never hear from me again.

988
01:15:41,505 --> 01:15:44,591
You know, I...
Um... I gotta go.

989
01:15:50,186 --> 01:15:52,177
What's so funny?

990
01:15:56,334 --> 01:16:01,300
Chuck and Buck, and suck and fuck
and chuckin', yuckin', muckin'...

991
01:16:17,987 --> 01:16:21,913
Do you remember me?

992
01:16:25,889 --> 01:16:28,869
Yeah, I remember you.

993
01:16:37,103 --> 01:16:40,100
I remember everything.

994
01:18:56,765 --> 01:18:57,716
Buck?

995
01:19:01,948 --> 01:19:03,993
Turn that off.

996
01:19:13,901 --> 01:19:16,982
I'm gonna go home now.

997
01:19:18,065 --> 01:19:21,036
I don't want you to go.

998
01:19:23,012 --> 01:19:25,323
We had a deal.

999
01:19:26,368 --> 01:19:27,420
OK?

1000
01:19:32,861 --> 01:19:35,855
You've got to grow up.

1001
01:19:36,610 --> 01:19:38,698
Like you?

1002
01:19:41,261 --> 01:19:44,269
I'm trying, you know.

1003
01:19:47,687 --> 01:19:51,655
There's somebody else in my life now.

1004
01:20:28,772 --> 01:20:30,769
<i>Goodbye, Buck.</i>

1005
01:21:31,503 --> 01:21:33,579
<i>Hey, Buck.</i>

1006
01:21:43,192 --> 01:21:46,192
Buck... What's wrong?

1007
01:21:50,819 --> 01:21:53,841
There's no love for me.

1008
01:21:53,951 --> 01:21:55,933
Not anymore.

1009
01:21:57,446 --> 01:21:58,957
Yes, there is.

1010
01:22:01,240 --> 01:22:02,818
Yes, there is.

1011
01:22:09,912 --> 01:22:11,924
I like Coke.

1012
01:22:17,507 --> 01:22:19,598
I miss my Mom.

1013
01:22:26,402 --> 01:22:29,452
I'm afraid of a lot of things, you know?

1014
01:22:30,363 --> 01:22:32,341
I am, too.

1015
01:22:35,025 --> 01:22:35,810
You are?

1016
01:22:35,979 --> 01:22:37,949
Lots of things.

1017
01:22:38,721 --> 01:22:40,755
I'm a mess.

1018
01:23:39,560 --> 01:23:40,573
Hey.

1019
01:23:43,147 --> 01:23:46,181
Uh... I just wanted to come by and, uh...

1020
01:23:47,436 --> 01:23:49,466
say I'm sorry.

1021
01:23:49,631 --> 01:23:52,002
What, you wanna hump me or something?

1022
01:23:52,009 --> 01:23:53,556
No.

1023
01:23:55,170 --> 01:23:59,111
I'm just...
I'm just sorry.

1024
01:24:00,715 --> 01:24:05,921
Don't ever do that to me again, 'cause...
I don't wanna hump ya.

1025
01:24:06,283 --> 01:24:08,765
Yeah, OK.

1026
01:24:09,707 --> 01:24:11,263
You know what I think?

1027
01:24:11,291 --> 01:24:13,149
I think you gotta move in across the hall.

1028
01:24:13,150 --> 01:24:15,978
'Cause I don't wanna some bitch moving in
that's gonna get on my ass.

1029
01:24:15,979 --> 01:24:17,807
You know, I need
somebody in there like you.

1030
01:24:17,808 --> 01:24:21,830
Somebody who's gonna let me be me,
and let me do my shit, you know.

1031
01:24:22,050 --> 01:24:25,627
Is that really?
- Yeah, why not?

1032
01:24:25,716 --> 01:24:28,477
Well, I don't wanna some bitch
movin' in there.

1033
01:24:28,513 --> 01:24:30,484
<i>Good job, guys.</i>

1034
01:24:30,585 --> 01:24:32,452
Yes, that's very nice.

1035
01:24:32,518 --> 01:24:35,507
How are you guys doing?
- Nice.

1036
01:24:45,873 --> 01:24:48,833
<i>So where do you want this?</i>

1037
01:24:49,153 --> 01:24:52,684
Yeah, right there is OK.

1038
01:25:07,646 --> 01:25:11,262
I just wanna say, uh...
basically, um... thank you.

1039
01:25:11,321 --> 01:25:13,611
Thank you.
"Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang"...

1040
01:25:13,612 --> 01:25:15,200
was a hit.

1041
01:25:15,318 --> 01:25:19,418
And I think it's gonna go on and on
and on to thank you very, very much.

1042
01:25:19,439 --> 01:25:23,521
Well, I'm glad that the Board is happy
and that the theatre is doing fine.

1043
01:25:23,522 --> 01:25:26,637
And that the whole season is
all worked up now.

1044
01:25:27,003 --> 01:25:28,536
But I...

1045
01:25:28,819 --> 01:25:31,781
I'd like to see us try
something more meddier.

1046
01:25:31,782 --> 01:25:34,496
I mean, does it always have to be
children's theatre?

1047
01:25:34,497 --> 01:25:35,473
<i>No, of course not.</i>

1048
01:25:35,474 --> 01:25:39,770
<i>I mean, I'd... I'd like to get my
hands on... on an Ibsen or a Chekhov.</i>

1049
01:25:40,455 --> 01:25:44,490
<i>You know? I don't know,
something more intense.</i>

1050
01:25:57,888 --> 01:26:00,704
You know what I mean, Barry.

1051
01:26:00,751 --> 01:26:02,648
<i>I'll take the white wine
and your cake with chocolate.</i>

1052
01:26:02,649 --> 01:26:05,827
Well, let's see how you do with it. I mean, no,
just do your "Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang"...

1053
01:26:05,902 --> 01:26:07,833
Well, just keep it
in the back of your mind.

1054
01:26:07,834 --> 01:26:09,893
It's in the front of my mind!

1055
01:26:20,741 --> 01:26:23,073
For "Chitty Chitty, Bang Bang".

1056
01:26:31,463 --> 01:26:33,754
Hey, Jake.
- Hey, Buck.

1057
01:26:35,428 --> 01:26:37,104
Hey, guys.
- Hi!

1058
01:26:39,434 --> 01:26:42,419
OK, yeah. Hold on.

1059
01:26:42,759 --> 01:26:45,784
Buck, letter came for you.

1060
01:26:50,134 --> 01:26:54,117
Well, I'm sure that... that those
changes will make a difference.

1061
01:26:54,120 --> 01:26:57,166
OK, all right, all right, all right.
I'll talk to you later.

1062
01:26:57,225 --> 01:26:59,243
<i>Mr. Buck O'Brien</i>

1063
01:27:05,512 --> 01:27:07,794
<i>Mr. and Mrs. Charles T. Carlson

1064
01:27:07,795 --> 01:27:11,377

Carlyn Carlson to Charlie Sitter.</i>

1065
01:27:11,470 --> 01:27:13,482
<i>What is it?</i>

1066
01:27:16,784 --> 01:27:20,155
It's an invitation to a wedding.

1067
01:27:20,291 --> 01:27:22,084
<i>Oh! Who's been marrying?</i>

1068
01:27:22,166 --> 01:27:25,160
This guy I know.

1069
01:27:44,754 --> 01:27:47,680
<i>Look at you, what the fuck?</i>

1070
01:27:47,883 --> 01:27:50,349
Oh, I'm going on a wedding.
- Man, you look great.

1071

Thanks.
I'm gonna be late.

1072
01:27:53,220 --> 01:27:56,128
All right. I want you to stop by later.
- OK, see you later.

1073
01:27:56,129 --> 01:27:58,524
All right. Hey,
can I borrow that jacket sometime?

1074
01:27:58,679 --> 01:28:02,172
Uh... OK.
- All right.

1075
01:28:10,387 --> 01:28:12,548

1077

1078
01:28:17,436 --> 01:28:22,682
from this day forward
for as long as you both shall live?

1079
01:28:22,826 --> 01:28:24,795

- And do you, Carlyn,</i>

1080
01:28:24,796 --> 01:28:28,308

I do.

1084
01:28:37,099 --> 01:28:40,217
I now pronounce you husband and wife.

1085
01:28:40,291 --> 01:28:42,238
You may kiss the bride.

1086
01:29:19,710 --> 01:29:21,731
Good cake.

1087
01:29:25,706 --> 01:29:27,767
