00:01:37,680 --> 00:01:39,079
<i>This is Tow-6 to base.</i>

2
00:01:39,480 --> 00:01:43,792
Hello? This is Tow-6 to base. Pick up.
Get your hand off the doughnut.

3
00:01:44,120 --> 00:01:46,588
<i>- Hello, Tow-6, this is base.</i>
- Thank you.

4
00:01:46,960 --> 00:01:48,439
<i>- How long to get back?</i>
- 15 minutes.

5
00:01:48,760 --> 00:01:49,590
<i>See you soon.</i>

6
00:01:49,840 --> 00:01:51,159
That's a ten-four.

7
00:01:52,360 --> 00:01:56,478
Hoffman told you? What the hell
are you doing listening to that idiot?

8
00:01:56,800 --> 00:01:59,394
You probably just cost this company
the whole account!

9
00:02:00,080 --> 00:02:00,956
Jesus, Mary...

10
00:02:36,840 --> 00:02:38,637
Hang in there. Help is on the way.

11
00:02:42,240 --> 00:02:43,195
Hang tight.

12
00:02:51,200 --> 00:02:52,952
You're going to be okay.
Don't move.

13
00:02:58,880 --> 00:02:59,915
Can you hear me?

14
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:04,153
Easy, easy! Watch his left arm.
It could be broken.

15
00:03:04,560 --> 00:03:05,390
Careful.

16
00:03:12,040 --> 00:03:13,951
Check this out.

17
00:03:22,360 --> 00:03:24,157
It was velcroed under the dash.

18
00:03:24,880 --> 00:03:25,995
Thanks.

19
00:03:26,680 --> 00:03:28,352
He had a gun.

20
00:03:50,160 --> 00:03:51,229
Let's go back, then.

21
00:03:51,560 --> 00:03:52,834
I ought to slap her.

22
00:03:53,440 --> 00:03:54,270
Big ass.

23
00:03:54,560 --> 00:03:56,516
She was a bitch. A real bitch.

24
00:03:56,800 --> 00:03:58,279
Tell me about it.

25
00:04:12,760 --> 00:04:14,239
Fine, chump!

26
00:04:34,480 --> 00:04:36,675
Okay, kids, wake up.
I'm going inside.

27
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,195
Kids, you ready?

28
00:04:43,640 --> 00:04:44,993
<i>Yeah, we're ready.</i>

29
00:04:45,360 --> 00:04:47,078
We're going to knock on the door.

30
00:04:49,080 --> 00:04:50,479
Knock on the door, Biggs.

31
00:04:52,040 --> 00:04:52,916
Police!

32
00:04:53,720 --> 00:04:55,551
Police! Freeze!
Don't even think about it!

33
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:56,869
Get away from the gun!

34
00:04:58,480 --> 00:04:59,754
What are you doing in here?

35
00:05:01,520 --> 00:05:02,635
Hands behind your back.

36
00:05:02,920 --> 00:05:04,239
Let her go, you moron!

37
00:05:04,800 --> 00:05:06,472
You're going to have to kill me!

38
00:05:16,240 --> 00:05:18,913
Hands in the air!
Against the wall! Do it!

39
00:05:33,080 --> 00:05:34,274
Get over there!

40
00:05:34,600 --> 00:05:35,635
Not my baby!

41
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,873
Come here. Get over here.

42
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:41,678
- Freeze!
- My baby's crying.

43
00:05:42,640 --> 00:05:44,551
Stay where you are. Freeze!

44
00:05:46,600 --> 00:05:48,158
Just let me check on my baby.

45
00:05:48,440 --> 00:05:50,078
- Step away.
- Have a heart, man.

46
00:05:50,360 --> 00:05:51,554
Get away!

47
00:06:14,600 --> 00:06:16,158
Excellent work, young man.

48
00:06:19,040 --> 00:06:20,075
<i>What a fight!</i>

49
00:06:23,800 --> 00:06:26,758
Okay, Michael.
Regular or extra-crispy?

50
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:37,873
Damn, Michael!

51
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,229
I could've done that.

52
00:06:39,560 --> 00:06:40,913
I'll need a tetanus shot.

53
00:06:41,200 --> 00:06:43,111
Help me out of this chicken suit.

54
00:06:45,600 --> 00:06:47,158
That's $ 120 more.

55
00:06:47,720 --> 00:06:52,077
With the taxes Americans pay,
health care should be free.

56
00:06:52,360 --> 00:06:55,238
You got my vote, honey.
But you're still $ 18 short.

57
00:07:02,960 --> 00:07:03,870
Marie!

58
00:07:07,560 --> 00:07:08,709
Mark.

59
00:07:09,000 --> 00:07:11,150
Mark. What happened?

60
00:07:11,640 --> 00:07:13,631
Don't worry.
It's not as bad as it looks.

61
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:15,758
See? Legs still work.

62
00:07:16,680 --> 00:07:18,511
But your neck, your arm.

63
00:07:18,800 --> 00:07:22,679
I got a plate there from an old injury,
so they put that on as a precaution.

64
00:07:23,240 --> 00:07:26,152
I don't know what happened.
I'm driving the truck to base.

65
00:07:26,480 --> 00:07:28,994
The next thing I know,
I was upside down in the cab.

66
00:07:29,680 --> 00:07:31,432
Then you were very lucky.

67
00:07:32,480 --> 00:07:34,436
You have no idea.

68
00:07:36,640 --> 00:07:38,471
Officer Porter,
thanks for your help.

69
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:40,199
I'm sorry, you're under arrest.

70
00:07:41,560 --> 00:07:43,357
- Is this a joke?
- This is no joke.

71
00:07:44,080 --> 00:07:46,719
Come on. We'll straighten it out
down at the station.

72
00:07:48,680 --> 00:07:50,398
Hey, Cosmo.
This one's on me.

73
00:07:50,680 --> 00:07:51,908
About time, you cheap bastard.

74
00:07:52,200 --> 00:07:53,997
- Only one.
- Then I'll make it a double.

75
00:07:54,280 --> 00:07:57,477
As long as I live, if I never see Gerard
in yellow tights again...

76
00:07:57,760 --> 00:07:59,193
...I'll die a happy man.

77
00:07:59,880 --> 00:08:02,474
Hey fellows, look.
Look, you're on TV.

78
00:08:03,200 --> 00:08:04,792
Look at us! We're on TV!

79
00:08:06,320 --> 00:08:07,878
We're on TV. Make it louder!

80
00:08:12,520 --> 00:08:15,557
When he grabbed you by the throat,
I thought I'd take a dump.

81
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,070
I did. I had to go change my underwear.

82
00:08:19,720 --> 00:08:22,757
<i>Look at my head! 27 stitches!</i>
<i>All because of this scumbag!</i>

83
00:08:23,000 --> 00:08:24,877
27 stitches, my ass!

84
00:08:26,960 --> 00:08:30,555
<i>The Conroys have made allegations</i>
<i>of excessive use of force...</i>

85
00:08:30,800 --> 00:08:33,951
<i>... particularly against senior</i>
<i>Deputy Marshal Samuel Gerard.</i>

86
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:36,196
I don't look like that.
That guy's ugly.

87
00:08:36,720 --> 00:08:39,917
Nice suit. She'll have a martini,
and we'll take a check.

88
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:41,519
- Who died?
- Shut up.

89
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,594
<i>Reporting from the federal courthouse,</i>
<i>Stacia Vela.</i>

90
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,836
Ladies and gentlemen,
the U.S. Marshals!

91
00:08:52,320 --> 00:08:54,754
Ladies and gentlemen,
put your hands together...

92
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:56,598
...for the U.S. Marshal Service.

93
00:08:58,720 --> 00:08:59,869
Speech! Speech!

94
00:09:04,720 --> 00:09:09,271
Noah Newman, Cosmo Renfro,
Savannah Cooper, Bobby Biggs!

95
00:09:10,080 --> 00:09:12,753
You guys are, without doubt,
the sorriest excuse...

96
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:14,797
...for a warrant squad
I ever worked with.

97
00:09:15,440 --> 00:09:16,839
But nobody got hurt.

98
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:20,157
It's probably important.
And you stayed close on the lead dog.

99
00:09:21,280 --> 00:09:23,748
- Which means you get to keep working.
- Get paid too?

100
00:09:24,000 --> 00:09:26,878
A round for this group here,
and a double milk for this kid.

101
00:09:32,200 --> 00:09:36,239
Mr. Warren. We seem to have
a small discrepancy.

102
00:09:39,480 --> 00:09:40,356
Let me help you.

103
00:09:41,240 --> 00:09:42,070
That's not me.

104
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:46,875
You caught that. You're aware it's
illegal to carry a handgun in Chicago?

105
00:09:48,680 --> 00:09:49,590
Come on.

106
00:09:49,880 --> 00:09:53,270
You ever try towing a car on the
Dan Ryan at 3 a.m. Without a handgun?

107
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,160
What about East 42nd,
1 st Avenue in New York City?

108
00:09:56,560 --> 00:09:58,755
- What about it?
- Ever been there?

109
00:09:59,120 --> 00:10:00,872
Never.

110
00:10:02,160 --> 00:10:05,630
Then you wouldn't know about the double
homicide took place there last December?

111
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:07,110
Obviously not.

112
00:10:07,480 --> 00:10:10,233
That's interesting.
Because the prints we took off you...

113
00:10:11,320 --> 00:10:12,673
...flagged this.

114
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:15,833
Federal arrest warrant for Mark Roberts.

115
00:10:16,120 --> 00:10:17,917
Prints from the crime scene
match yours.

116
00:10:18,440 --> 00:10:19,429
This is bullshit.

117
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,751
Let me talk to a lawyer.
Don't touch me.

118
00:10:22,040 --> 00:10:23,393
They got a lawyer...

119
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,830
...for your extradition hearing!

120
00:10:26,080 --> 00:10:27,672
You're going back to New York.

121
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:31,993
I've never been to New York! I don't
know nothing about a double homicide.

122
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:33,515
Get him out of here.

123
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:36,354
You'll have plenty of time
to explain that in New York.

124
00:10:36,600 --> 00:10:37,874
You got the wrong man.

125
00:10:38,280 --> 00:10:39,395
Get him out of here.

126
00:10:40,760 --> 00:10:41,829
Thanks.

127
00:10:44,120 --> 00:10:47,908
- Warren. Mark Warren. What's going on?
- I don't know.

128
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:49,959
Why is it taking so long?

129
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:51,559
It's still being processed.

130
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:55,074
Hold it there.

131
00:10:57,320 --> 00:10:58,150
It's okay.

132
00:10:58,520 --> 00:10:59,475
What's happening?

133
00:10:59,760 --> 00:11:00,988
Just a mistaken identity.

134
00:11:01,520 --> 00:11:02,635
Where you going?

135
00:11:03,000 --> 00:11:06,595
Just be cool, baby.
Everything's going to be fine.

136
00:11:23,640 --> 00:11:24,834
I'll be right back.

137
00:11:26,920 --> 00:11:28,797
Hello, Deputy.
I'm surprised you made it.

138
00:11:29,600 --> 00:11:30,555
Catherine.

139
00:11:31,280 --> 00:11:32,554
This is Stacia Vela.

140
00:11:32,840 --> 00:11:35,991
This is U.S. Marshal Catherine Walsh.
She's the boss.

141
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:39,996
Delighted. I've seen you so much on TV.
You're very lovely in person.

142
00:11:40,880 --> 00:11:41,869
Thank you.

143
00:11:42,160 --> 00:11:45,914
You're welcome. I'm going to take Sam
away from you for just a minute.

144
00:11:46,520 --> 00:11:48,875
Sure. I'll go and wait at the bar.

145
00:11:51,120 --> 00:11:54,829
Never one to be afraid of the obvious.
I admire that in a man.

146
00:11:55,120 --> 00:11:56,394
Did I do something?

147
00:11:57,240 --> 00:12:00,994
You hit your prisoner while he was
in handcuffs. He could sue us.

148
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:04,158
He bit one of my kids,
got smacked on the head. So what?

149
00:12:04,440 --> 00:12:06,396
- "So what?"
- Yeah, so what?

150
00:12:06,680 --> 00:12:07,999
27 stitches is "So what?"

151
00:12:08,960 --> 00:12:11,872
He needed a smack on the head,
he got it. What's the big deal?

152
00:12:12,760 --> 00:12:15,433
D.C. Wants to take full advantage
of this Conroy bust.

153
00:12:15,720 --> 00:12:19,395
You are going to personally escort
these clowns to the federal pen.

154
00:12:19,680 --> 00:12:22,194
You will give
a little speech to the press.

155
00:12:22,520 --> 00:12:24,192
You are going...

156
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:28,149
...to do a nice little P.R.
Song and dance and then...

157
00:12:28,440 --> 00:12:30,032
...you are going to go fishing...

158
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:31,719
...or something.

159
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:35,470
You're going to take a vacation.
You're going to be happy.

160
00:12:41,720 --> 00:12:44,154
The plane leaves at midnight.
You be on it.

161
00:12:52,880 --> 00:12:53,949
Keep moving.

162
00:12:55,680 --> 00:12:57,477
Right over there. Let's go.

163
00:13:16,920 --> 00:13:19,388
Welcome to the unfriendly skies, Sam.

164
00:13:26,040 --> 00:13:26,916
72.

165
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:28,036
Check.

166
00:13:31,000 --> 00:13:32,399
84.

167
00:13:36,080 --> 00:13:37,638
36.

168
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:39,989
Check.

169
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:53,519
Set your bag over here.

170
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:00,999
Look at the bright side.

171
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,110
We're on time.

172
00:14:10,960 --> 00:14:12,154
Close up.

173
00:14:16,600 --> 00:14:17,794
Lock it up.

174
00:14:23,440 --> 00:14:24,236
All locked.

175
00:14:28,120 --> 00:14:30,588
Clearance, F-PATS 343, Memphis.

176
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:34,874
Okay. It's on to Memphis and then
La Guardia, and we call it a night.

177
00:14:46,680 --> 00:14:48,352
Turn out the light. It's late.

178
00:14:48,640 --> 00:14:50,232
Be a couple of minutes.

179
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:30,634
Got to use the can.

180
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,951
You can hold it.
We got 20 minutes.

181
00:15:33,720 --> 00:15:35,039
I've been holding it.

182
00:15:35,280 --> 00:15:36,872
I have to go right now.

183
00:15:37,720 --> 00:15:39,676
I'm serious.
I'm about to explode right here.

184
00:15:42,440 --> 00:15:43,316
Can he go?

185
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:45,790
Yeah.

186
00:15:50,440 --> 00:15:51,395
7-C.

187
00:16:04,640 --> 00:16:05,959
All right, let's go.

188
00:17:42,080 --> 00:17:44,355
"Split on ice."
7 letters.

189
00:17:44,600 --> 00:17:45,350
Banana.

190
00:17:45,800 --> 00:17:47,279
No, bananas.

191
00:17:49,000 --> 00:17:50,672
Bananas. Plural.

192
00:17:54,600 --> 00:17:55,396
Bananas.

193
00:18:31,960 --> 00:18:33,234
What was that?

194
00:18:33,480 --> 00:18:35,835
Cabin pressure! Oxygen mask on.

195
00:18:39,160 --> 00:18:39,990
Sinking 2,000.

196
00:18:53,520 --> 00:18:55,112
Engine failure on 2 and 3.

197
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:57,556
Indy Center, this is F-PATS flight 343.

198
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,993
We are declaring an emergency.

199
00:19:00,320 --> 00:19:01,275
Mayday, Mayday!

200
00:19:05,320 --> 00:19:06,196
Going through 240.

201
00:19:14,000 --> 00:19:14,750
13,000.

202
00:19:16,200 --> 00:19:16,996
I've got it.

203
00:19:17,800 --> 00:19:18,630
11,000.

204
00:19:28,160 --> 00:19:29,070
We're at 10,000.

205
00:19:30,320 --> 00:19:31,230
What was that?

206
00:19:32,040 --> 00:19:34,838
We lost engines 2 and 3.
A and B hydraulic failures as well.

207
00:19:35,480 --> 00:19:38,677
Look at your charts. See if there's
any airport we can make.

208
00:19:39,480 --> 00:19:40,196
Nothing close.

209
00:19:40,560 --> 00:19:41,913
There's a road 20 miles ahead.

210
00:19:42,640 --> 00:19:43,709
That's it then.

211
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,076
Indy Center, this is F-PATS 343.

212
00:19:52,440 --> 00:19:55,034
And still losing altitude.
We have lost 2 engines...

213
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:57,840
...and we need to make
an immediate emergency landing.

214
00:19:58,320 --> 00:19:59,799
Make the announcement.

215
00:20:00,040 --> 00:20:01,917
Brace for an emergency landing.

216
00:20:02,160 --> 00:20:04,833
<i>Place your head between your knees</i>
<i>and brace for impact.</i>

217
00:20:05,640 --> 00:20:07,835
<i>Keep your heads down. Brace for impact.</i>

218
00:20:16,440 --> 00:20:17,156
3,000.

219
00:20:20,080 --> 00:20:21,798
2,000 above ground. Sinking 1,500.

220
00:20:22,160 --> 00:20:23,559
I got the road.

221
00:20:24,880 --> 00:20:25,995
Okay, gear down.

222
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:39,708
1,000.

223
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:43,193
500 above the ground.

224
00:20:45,200 --> 00:20:47,111
100 above ground. Brace for impact.

225
00:21:21,160 --> 00:21:22,388
Jesus Christ!

226
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:23,629
Holy shit!

227
00:22:03,480 --> 00:22:04,469
Oh, God.

228
00:22:04,760 --> 00:22:06,239
We're running out of road!

229
00:22:52,360 --> 00:22:54,749
Get down.
This man is unconscious.

230
00:22:55,640 --> 00:22:56,914
This man right here.

231
00:23:18,000 --> 00:23:18,830
Get the weapons.

232
00:23:20,920 --> 00:23:22,512
All right, dudes, you're swimming.

233
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:29,629
Clear!

234
00:23:34,360 --> 00:23:35,270
Mine didn't open!

235
00:23:47,040 --> 00:23:48,473
Give me those keys!

236
00:23:51,480 --> 00:23:52,595
Slow down! One at a time!

237
00:23:56,160 --> 00:23:57,115
Keep it moving!

238
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,111
I ain't going in that water!

239
00:24:08,920 --> 00:24:09,636
Going somewhere?

240
00:24:10,960 --> 00:24:12,598
Hold that light on these shackles.

241
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:14,398
I'll get this guy out of here.

242
00:24:15,240 --> 00:24:17,231
Play any tricks, our guys'll shoot you.

243
00:24:26,320 --> 00:24:28,550
- Stand up!
- I can't swim!

244
00:24:28,800 --> 00:24:29,789
Get out!

245
00:24:48,240 --> 00:24:49,753
We're going under!
Leave them!

246
00:24:50,320 --> 00:24:51,992
Leave the rest of them!

247
00:24:53,160 --> 00:24:55,037
Come on! We got to move out!

248
00:25:38,000 --> 00:25:40,230
Get your head up there, jackoff.

249
00:25:42,920 --> 00:25:44,592
A deep breath!

250
00:26:03,760 --> 00:26:05,990
Calm down! You want to live?

251
00:27:34,440 --> 00:27:36,635
They found the 2 that fell
from the plane.

252
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:41,354
That Chinese fellow dropped in some
poor old boy's roof and into the bath.

253
00:27:41,640 --> 00:27:44,916
- Looks like a bowl of gumbo with ribs...
- I get the picture, Sheriff.

254
00:27:45,200 --> 00:27:48,237
We still got one prisoner
unaccounted for.

255
00:27:48,520 --> 00:27:50,636
Mark Roberts. He was seated in 10-D.

256
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:53,119
I guess the river got him.

257
00:27:53,520 --> 00:27:56,432
No, the river didn't get this guy.
He's loose.

258
00:27:56,720 --> 00:27:59,996
If you can't find him dead someplace,
he's running, folks.

259
00:28:02,120 --> 00:28:03,553
We got a fugitive.

260
00:28:04,360 --> 00:28:08,512
Seems we might have ourselves a bona
fide federal fugitive out on the lam.

261
00:28:08,760 --> 00:28:11,035
Name of Roberts, Mark J.

262
00:28:12,360 --> 00:28:13,793
Somebody give me a map.

263
00:28:14,640 --> 00:28:16,551
- Who's got a map around here?
- I got one.

264
00:28:18,480 --> 00:28:19,549
Thanks, Earl.

265
00:28:27,960 --> 00:28:32,351
I want you setting up roadblocks,
general radius...

266
00:28:34,000 --> 00:28:35,399
...of 10, 12 miles.

267
00:28:35,760 --> 00:28:36,715
20.

268
00:28:38,480 --> 00:28:40,596
He's got a real big head start.

269
00:28:41,680 --> 00:28:43,238
Okay, 20 then.

270
00:28:43,520 --> 00:28:44,919
That sounds good.

271
00:28:45,960 --> 00:28:49,555
- In all directions, just like a big...
- Perimeter.

272
00:28:50,960 --> 00:28:52,473
Circle deal.

273
00:28:52,880 --> 00:28:55,030
Which should start somewhere near...

274
00:28:58,960 --> 00:28:59,836
What do you think?

275
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:05,877
Said perimeter to extend downstream...

276
00:29:06,160 --> 00:29:07,149
...from Brookport...

277
00:29:07,600 --> 00:29:08,953
...to Mound City.

278
00:29:09,720 --> 00:29:12,075
Every bridge across the Ohio River
from Golconda...

279
00:29:12,360 --> 00:29:13,998
...to Metropolis to Cairo...

280
00:29:14,280 --> 00:29:15,998
...needs to be closed down.

281
00:29:16,560 --> 00:29:17,913
Extending south from Alexander...

282
00:29:18,160 --> 00:29:20,958
<i>... and Pulaski county lines,</i>
<i>have every house, hotel...</i>

283
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,350
<i>... hospital, back road and backwater...</i>

284
00:29:23,640 --> 00:29:25,119
<i>... searched for Mr. Mark J. Roberts.</i>

285
00:29:25,360 --> 00:29:28,557
<i>Get his picture on local television</i>
<i>and keep it there.</i>

286
00:29:28,840 --> 00:29:31,070
<i>Please consider him dangerous,</i>
<i>and please...</i>

287
00:29:31,560 --> 00:29:32,959
<i>... act accordingly.</i>

288
00:29:37,720 --> 00:29:39,756
Found a shoe. Looks like prison issue.

289
00:29:40,040 --> 00:29:42,031
Okay. Continue to search.

290
00:29:44,240 --> 00:29:45,958
We found the place he came ashore.

291
00:30:05,200 --> 00:30:06,076
Jesus!

292
00:30:06,480 --> 00:30:08,948
Looks like the skies
weren't too friendly last night.

293
00:30:09,200 --> 00:30:11,839
- Sam used up 8 of his 9 lives on this.
- He's over there.

294
00:30:12,160 --> 00:30:14,355
- Where?
- It looks like he's in one piece.

295
00:30:14,640 --> 00:30:16,358
Sammy, how you doing?

296
00:30:16,920 --> 00:30:19,115
Think they got
a fat-free menu in this joint?

297
00:30:19,480 --> 00:30:21,835
- What are you talking about?
- Anyone else hungry?

298
00:30:22,120 --> 00:30:23,758
- I don't believe you two.
- Smells good.

299
00:30:24,000 --> 00:30:25,911
How can you talk about food
at a time like this?

300
00:30:26,160 --> 00:30:29,869
I wonder if they have
that vinegar barbeque.

301
00:30:30,520 --> 00:30:32,636
- On the French fries.
- On the meat, the fries...

302
00:30:32,920 --> 00:30:35,150
- It's big in England.
- It's big everywhere.

303
00:30:35,480 --> 00:30:37,436
- You all right?
- No, who's got my clothes?

304
00:30:37,680 --> 00:30:38,590
I do.

305
00:30:40,240 --> 00:30:40,990
Nice?

306
00:30:43,640 --> 00:30:44,516
I knew it!

307
00:30:44,800 --> 00:30:48,156
- Told you he wouldn't like it.
- I got the same thing last Christmas.

308
00:30:53,360 --> 00:30:55,669
Anybody got $9 so I can buy a T-shirt?

309
00:30:56,040 --> 00:30:57,758
You owe me $85 for this.

310
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,797
I got one.

311
00:31:03,920 --> 00:31:06,753
State police found a shoe
over here near Hillerman.

312
00:31:07,040 --> 00:31:07,995
What do you got?

313
00:31:08,760 --> 00:31:11,911
Oh, boss, nothing, <i>nada</i>.
It's like this guy doesn't even exist.

314
00:31:12,200 --> 00:31:14,475
- Is this food free?
- Eat up. It's on the County.

315
00:31:14,720 --> 00:31:17,109
He called himself Mark Warren.
I.D. S were forged.

316
00:31:17,360 --> 00:31:20,352
Mark Roberts ain't nothing but
a photo and prints on a warrant.

317
00:31:20,760 --> 00:31:22,273
- This is the guy?
- Cute.

318
00:31:22,600 --> 00:31:23,828
Noah, you bring my gun?

319
00:31:26,640 --> 00:31:27,789
Cute, huh?

320
00:31:47,880 --> 00:31:49,472
Where will I find
Deputy Sam Gerard?

321
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:50,950
Here!

322
00:31:55,840 --> 00:31:59,037
Bertram Lamb. I'm director
of the Diplomatic Security Service...

323
00:31:59,440 --> 00:32:02,637
...State Department.
Special Agent Frank Barrows.

324
00:32:03,000 --> 00:32:05,719
- What's up?
- Mark Roberts.

325
00:32:06,520 --> 00:32:07,669
What do you know about him?

326
00:32:08,120 --> 00:32:09,599
Double murder, robbery, escape.

327
00:32:14,040 --> 00:32:15,917
These men were not ordinary civilians.

328
00:32:17,240 --> 00:32:20,152
They were my agents,
murdered by Mark Roberts...

329
00:32:20,480 --> 00:32:22,596
...in cold blood at the U.N.
Last January.

330
00:32:22,880 --> 00:32:24,950
- That's not on his warrant.
- All information...

331
00:32:25,240 --> 00:32:27,834
...on this was sanitized
for reasons of national security.

332
00:32:28,080 --> 00:32:30,719
- Why'd Mark Roberts kill your guys?
- We don't know.

333
00:32:30,960 --> 00:32:34,714
All we have are his fingerprints at the
scene. We've chased him for 6 months.

334
00:32:35,280 --> 00:32:37,111
So we're working for you now, huh?

335
00:32:38,680 --> 00:32:39,669
That's not my intention.

336
00:32:40,240 --> 00:32:41,912
Your reputation precedes you, Deputy.

337
00:32:42,200 --> 00:32:44,191
We want you to continue
running the pursuit...

338
00:32:44,760 --> 00:32:46,239
...but we want Roberts fast.

339
00:32:46,560 --> 00:32:47,390
Okay, we're fast.

340
00:32:48,640 --> 00:32:50,710
We'll need to be kept
in the loop on this.

341
00:32:51,000 --> 00:32:52,638
We'll try to keep you up to speed.

342
00:32:53,120 --> 00:32:55,953
So one of my men will
join your team to do just that.

343
00:32:56,240 --> 00:32:57,389
Special Agent John Royce.

344
00:33:00,280 --> 00:33:04,478
No offense, but we actually work a lot
faster if we don't have any help.

345
00:33:04,720 --> 00:33:07,359
No offense taken.
You don't have a choice.

346
00:33:07,640 --> 00:33:09,358
I've cleared this with Marshal Walsh.

347
00:33:10,000 --> 00:33:11,479
Royce is one of our best men.

348
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:13,354
You'll find him useful.

349
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:15,115
Good luck, Deputy.

350
00:33:23,160 --> 00:33:24,388
How you doing?

351
00:33:24,720 --> 00:33:27,598
- Lf it's any consolation, I wouldn't...
- It's no consolation.

352
00:33:28,920 --> 00:33:30,433
- Take off your sunglasses.
- Why?

353
00:33:30,720 --> 00:33:32,039
So I can see your face.

354
00:33:35,160 --> 00:33:36,673
How'd you pull this duty?

355
00:33:36,960 --> 00:33:39,235
Your fugitive murdered 2 of my friends.
I volunteered.

356
00:33:40,240 --> 00:33:41,958
Ever make a fugitive arrest before?

357
00:33:42,320 --> 00:33:44,959
- No. Planning to shortly.
- You have a weapon?

358
00:33:45,680 --> 00:33:46,669
A big one. You?

359
00:33:49,680 --> 00:33:51,432
You sure you want
to get cute with me?

360
00:33:55,560 --> 00:33:57,471
- Got a backup weapon?
- Never had the need.

361
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,519
Get one. Keep that in your suit
unless I tell you to take it out.

362
00:34:00,800 --> 00:34:03,394
Get a Glock.
Lose that nickel-plated sissy pistol.

363
00:34:03,640 --> 00:34:07,838
Let's move. I'm not having fun. You
know I get cranky when I don't have fun.

364
00:34:08,080 --> 00:34:09,274
We know, we know.

365
00:34:09,560 --> 00:34:11,551
Get the state police director
on the phone.

366
00:34:11,960 --> 00:34:14,997
Cooper, get the background
on the Chinese guy in the plane.

367
00:34:15,280 --> 00:34:19,717
Cosmo, get the local sheriff lined out
and ready to go. He's feeling weak.

368
00:34:19,960 --> 00:34:21,473
Working on it.

369
00:34:21,720 --> 00:34:22,914
You come with me.

370
00:34:24,640 --> 00:34:25,789
I think he likes you.

371
00:34:38,160 --> 00:34:39,229
Martha?

372
00:34:40,640 --> 00:34:41,709
Just drive.

373
00:34:50,480 --> 00:34:53,677
- How soon can I get on that airplane?
- Soon as we get it on the barge.

374
00:34:56,760 --> 00:34:58,990
I got something on that shooter
in the plane.

375
00:34:59,280 --> 00:35:03,558
Name's Vincent Ling. He was on his way
back to the pen. Just lost an appeal.

376
00:35:03,800 --> 00:35:06,598
Serving a life sentence for murder
for a Chinese mob hit.

377
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:11,112
Sheriff in Metropolis just found this in
a dumpster behind a laundromat.

378
00:35:12,760 --> 00:35:15,877
All right. Our boy
got a new set of clothes.

379
00:35:16,240 --> 00:35:18,800
- Where's Metropolis?
- I don't know. Ask Superman.

380
00:35:19,040 --> 00:35:20,359
Shut up, Biggs.

381
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:23,832
Get on the radio, move that perimeter
20 miles south of the river.

382
00:35:24,080 --> 00:35:26,071
He might've made it into
Kentucky already.

383
00:35:26,920 --> 00:35:29,388
Statistically, he's more likely headed
for a city.

384
00:35:29,680 --> 00:35:31,352
St. Louis. North.

385
00:35:31,640 --> 00:35:33,039
He's no statistic.

386
00:35:34,840 --> 00:35:35,829
Not yet.

387
00:36:10,840 --> 00:36:14,037
Holy shit! Sammy, you're a lucky man.
How many dead?

388
00:36:14,320 --> 00:36:15,196
Eight.

389
00:36:34,800 --> 00:36:36,472
You got your little black box?

390
00:36:42,840 --> 00:36:43,989
Save that light.

391
00:36:46,960 --> 00:36:47,915
What's that?

392
00:36:57,240 --> 00:36:59,708
That is not a ballpoint pen.

393
00:37:00,120 --> 00:37:04,557
Zip guns aren't standard issue on
federal corrections prisoner transports.

394
00:37:05,440 --> 00:37:06,873
No, that's in those spy movies.

395
00:37:07,280 --> 00:37:08,793
I saw one on TV one time.

396
00:37:09,080 --> 00:37:11,719
- That James Bond movie.
- Shagadelic, baby.

397
00:37:12,040 --> 00:37:12,870
Shaft.

398
00:37:13,720 --> 00:37:14,914
Send it to a lab.

399
00:37:15,600 --> 00:37:16,669
Stinger.

400
00:37:16,920 --> 00:37:19,434
XL-17, Korean... 22 caliber.

401
00:37:19,840 --> 00:37:22,070
He found it with his little flashlight.

402
00:37:23,680 --> 00:37:25,511
What the hell are you doing?

403
00:37:29,880 --> 00:37:32,075
That was my phone.
It was my personal phone.

404
00:37:32,360 --> 00:37:35,716
You're under arrest for obstructing
a federal investigation.

405
00:37:36,000 --> 00:37:37,911
- It's not convictable.
- It's arrestable.

406
00:37:38,200 --> 00:37:40,191
Are you crazy? Is this guy crazy?

407
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:41,789
No, but he's a carrier.

408
00:37:42,080 --> 00:37:43,559
My superiors won't like this.

409
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,075
I am your superior.
Sit down and shut up.

410
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:48,954
When you keep information from us,
it pisses him off.

411
00:37:50,560 --> 00:37:52,994
Deputy, get me out of these cuffs
right now.

412
00:37:54,440 --> 00:37:55,634
Get out of them yourself.

413
00:38:04,440 --> 00:38:05,429
What are you doing?

414
00:38:05,720 --> 00:38:07,199
What's he doing?

415
00:38:19,000 --> 00:38:20,228
What's next, cow tipping?

416
00:38:21,680 --> 00:38:22,874
That's pretty good.

417
00:38:23,160 --> 00:38:26,072
- Very slick.
- Very slick? He broke my glasses.

418
00:38:26,640 --> 00:38:27,834
I've never seen that.

419
00:38:29,640 --> 00:38:30,516
I have.

420
00:38:44,760 --> 00:38:48,150
Don't have a heart attack, Earl.
You've lied to the cops before.

421
00:39:11,120 --> 00:39:12,838
What's the trouble, officer?

422
00:39:13,120 --> 00:39:15,554
Fugitive's on the loose
from the plane crash last night.

423
00:39:15,960 --> 00:39:17,598
Is that a fact? Shit!

424
00:39:17,840 --> 00:39:18,989
You seen this man?

425
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,396
No, I've never seen
anybody like that.

426
00:39:22,000 --> 00:39:24,150
What about you, ma'am?
You seen this man?

427
00:39:24,640 --> 00:39:25,914
No, me neither.

428
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:33,913
Thanks for your help, folks.

429
00:39:43,920 --> 00:39:45,353
Drive! Drive! Drive!

430
00:39:54,320 --> 00:39:55,116
Push!

431
00:40:09,600 --> 00:40:11,238
Chester, you okay?!

432
00:40:17,720 --> 00:40:19,039
You done good, Earl.

433
00:40:24,240 --> 00:40:26,913
An 18-wheeler rammed a roadblock
15 minutes ago.

434
00:40:27,200 --> 00:40:29,350
They found it outside of Paducah.
It was heading south.

435
00:40:30,000 --> 00:40:30,876
All right, load up!

436
00:40:31,160 --> 00:40:32,354
Like I said, south.

437
00:40:32,640 --> 00:40:35,598
We're going to need boats.
This guy went into the swamp.

438
00:40:36,440 --> 00:40:37,919
Shit, I hate swamps.

439
00:40:38,360 --> 00:40:42,239
Lester, it's U.S. Marshal Renfro.
We're going to need boats.

440
00:40:42,560 --> 00:40:46,075
Swamp boats. Right.
Like they use in the swamp.

441
00:41:08,280 --> 00:41:10,748
Bad news. He got a.38 off the trucker.

442
00:41:11,000 --> 00:41:13,116
- How many rounds?
- 6 in the gun, 12 more in a box.

443
00:41:13,440 --> 00:41:14,634
Makes no difference.

444
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,836
He'll be dead from snakebite by dark.

445
00:41:18,800 --> 00:41:21,872
He won't get far in that boat he stole.
It ain't got no motor.

446
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,390
Boats. I hate boats, bugs and boats.

447
00:41:24,720 --> 00:41:27,029
Sam, he got a boat from here.

448
00:41:31,160 --> 00:41:32,752
Could I have your attention?

449
00:41:33,040 --> 00:41:35,031
We'll divide up and search this swamp.

450
00:41:35,320 --> 00:41:39,029
One officer with each of you.
Who knows most about this terrain?

451
00:41:40,760 --> 00:41:43,593
Who's the ugliest, most inbred,
country son of a bitch here?

452
00:41:46,960 --> 00:41:48,029
You come with me.

453
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:26,355
How long will you be?

454
00:42:26,800 --> 00:42:29,109
Everybody com-check with me now on 3.

455
00:42:29,440 --> 00:42:30,759
- Sam.
- Com-check 3.

456
00:42:34,000 --> 00:42:35,877
You get a visual, put up a flare...

457
00:42:36,160 --> 00:42:38,116
...call for backup, stay in the boat!

458
00:42:39,000 --> 00:42:41,468
How long will you be out?
I got PTA tonight.

459
00:42:41,720 --> 00:42:44,154
We'll be out till we catch him.
PTA's on hold.

460
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:46,239
Be careful.

461
00:44:13,840 --> 00:44:14,875
I got a visual.

462
00:44:15,320 --> 00:44:17,117
Put up your flare.

463
00:44:18,960 --> 00:44:20,154
He's moving.
I'm going in.

464
00:44:20,480 --> 00:44:22,630
Stay in the boat. Wait for us.

465
00:44:39,080 --> 00:44:40,035
Through there.

466
00:44:52,920 --> 00:44:55,559
Pull up to that bank.
Get around to the other side.

467
00:44:55,800 --> 00:44:58,268
Be careful. This man's mad
and he's got a gun.

468
00:45:00,080 --> 00:45:00,956
It's him.

469
00:45:01,200 --> 00:45:02,110
Go! Faster!

470
00:45:54,200 --> 00:45:55,553
I'll take the gun.

471
00:45:57,880 --> 00:45:59,677
Come on, move! Move, move!

472
00:45:59,960 --> 00:46:00,870
What happens now?

473
00:46:01,160 --> 00:46:02,878
We dance. Walk.

474
00:46:03,480 --> 00:46:04,674
Drop the gun, pal.

475
00:46:06,120 --> 00:46:08,554
It's been a long day.
Let's end it on a positive note.

476
00:46:10,040 --> 00:46:11,712
For me or for you?

477
00:46:12,000 --> 00:46:13,479
Everyone lives,
everyone wins.

478
00:46:14,560 --> 00:46:16,676
How long will I live if you take me in?

479
00:46:18,360 --> 00:46:19,634
You forget about the plane?

480
00:46:19,920 --> 00:46:21,114
Look around, you're caught.

481
00:46:26,200 --> 00:46:27,428
It's over.

482
00:46:28,680 --> 00:46:29,908
Let's go home.

483
00:46:37,040 --> 00:46:38,598
You go home.

484
00:47:01,760 --> 00:47:02,909
Gerard's been hit.

485
00:47:09,840 --> 00:47:10,875
He's over there.

486
00:48:00,640 --> 00:48:02,232
- How is he?
- He'll be fine.

487
00:48:17,080 --> 00:48:18,559
How is it to nearly get killed?

488
00:48:20,120 --> 00:48:23,556
If he was trying to kill me, he'd have
shot me in the head, not the vest.

489
00:48:25,440 --> 00:48:27,396
Ever occur to you maybe he just missed?

490
00:48:27,640 --> 00:48:29,676
We're not dealing with a guy
who misses.

491
00:48:33,240 --> 00:48:36,152
Maybe it's time to let someone else
catch this one.

492
00:48:37,600 --> 00:48:39,989
- You don't think I'm incapable...
- You're capable, sure.

493
00:48:40,280 --> 00:48:42,111
Okay, then let me do my job.

494
00:48:46,160 --> 00:48:47,752
Don't make me wrong, Sam.

495
00:48:49,080 --> 00:48:50,479
You screw up and I swear...

496
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,035
I know.

497
00:48:55,800 --> 00:48:57,153
I love you, Sam.

498
00:49:00,600 --> 00:49:02,352
But don't think I won't fire your ass.

499
00:49:17,880 --> 00:49:21,953
Biggs, you and Cooper are staying here.
We're going back to Chicago.

500
00:49:22,320 --> 00:49:25,596
We'll find out who put that gun
on the plane and who Mark Roberts is.

501
00:49:25,840 --> 00:49:28,673
Take us to the airport. Who's got
my gun and credentials?

502
00:49:36,440 --> 00:49:39,159
Look, I made a mistake, okay?
I usually work alone.

503
00:49:39,480 --> 00:49:41,277
We're lucky I got shot, kid.

504
00:49:41,600 --> 00:49:42,669
Lucky?

505
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:45,520
If he'd shot one of my deputies,
you wouldn't see your mama again...

506
00:49:45,800 --> 00:49:47,995
...I'd be in jail for shooting you.

507
00:49:49,840 --> 00:49:50,875
We're lucky.

508
00:49:51,160 --> 00:49:52,957
I thought we don't
take our work personally.

509
00:49:53,240 --> 00:49:54,229
We don't.

510
00:49:56,120 --> 00:49:57,155
I do.

511
00:50:06,320 --> 00:50:07,230
Just a sec.

512
00:50:07,920 --> 00:50:09,069
Starbucks.

513
00:50:11,800 --> 00:50:13,791
Some guy has a question
about his grinder.

514
00:50:14,280 --> 00:50:15,349
Excuse me.

515
00:50:20,080 --> 00:50:21,035
Can you talk?

516
00:50:21,520 --> 00:50:22,839
Wait a minute.

517
00:50:24,720 --> 00:50:27,154
Were you hurt? I saw the crash on TV.

518
00:50:28,240 --> 00:50:31,596
- Baby, I'm fine.
<i>- They keep saying you're a criminal.</i>

519
00:50:31,880 --> 00:50:32,949
You murdered 2 people.

520
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,477
No, no, it's a lie.
Marie, listen to me.

521
00:50:40,200 --> 00:50:41,030
Where are you?

522
00:50:41,320 --> 00:50:42,673
<i>I can 't tell you that now.</i>

523
00:50:42,960 --> 00:50:45,758
I know there's some things
I didn't tell you about myself.

524
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,355
Believe me. I didn't do
what they say I did.

525
00:50:49,560 --> 00:50:50,788
<i>You do believe me?</i>

526
00:50:51,080 --> 00:50:52,672
I want to believe you, Mark.

527
00:50:53,360 --> 00:50:55,271
I'm just confused and scared.

528
00:50:55,600 --> 00:50:57,192
<i>Now, Marie, listen to me.</i>

529
00:50:57,520 --> 00:50:59,476
<i>Before we met,</i>
<i>I worked for the government.</i>

530
00:50:59,760 --> 00:51:02,593
<i>I was on a routine assignment</i>
<i>when it was ambushed.</i>

531
00:51:03,280 --> 00:51:06,238
<i>I killed 2 men in self-defense.</i>

532
00:51:07,240 --> 00:51:09,231
<i>Marie, I did not murder anyone.</i>

533
00:51:09,800 --> 00:51:10,630
Believe me.

534
00:51:10,920 --> 00:51:11,989
<i>I wouldn 't lie to you.</i>

535
00:51:12,240 --> 00:51:13,468
What are you going to do?

536
00:51:13,720 --> 00:51:16,632
<i>I'll find the person who set me up</i>
<i>and clear my name.</i>

537
00:51:17,160 --> 00:51:20,835
It's something I thought
I could hide from, but I guess I can't.

538
00:51:22,120 --> 00:51:23,269
Will I see you again?

539
00:51:23,560 --> 00:51:26,028
<i>Oh, come on now. Don 't be crazy.</i>

540
00:51:26,520 --> 00:51:27,839
Of course you will.

541
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:35,949
I hate involving you in this, but,
baby, I got nobody else I can trust.

542
00:51:36,760 --> 00:51:37,988
<i>I can trust you?</i>

543
00:51:38,280 --> 00:51:39,793
Of course you can.

544
00:51:40,080 --> 00:51:41,274
<i>I love you.</i>

545
00:51:41,960 --> 00:51:43,188
I need your help.

546
00:51:52,880 --> 00:51:53,710
Henry?

547
00:51:55,080 --> 00:51:56,593
Got the casebooks on Roberts?

548
00:51:56,840 --> 00:52:00,799
There was a woman at the hospital
when he was arrested. Paid his bill.

549
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:02,553
- In cash.
- Find her.

550
00:52:05,920 --> 00:52:07,114
U.N. Garage has cameras.

551
00:52:08,200 --> 00:52:10,156
Get the date and time of the murders,
find the tapes.

552
00:52:10,480 --> 00:52:11,993
We'll never get clearance for that.

553
00:52:12,600 --> 00:52:15,398
Get the clearance, get the tapes.
Don't tell me what we can't do.

554
00:52:17,200 --> 00:52:18,189
I'll get it done.

555
00:52:18,520 --> 00:52:20,078
- What?
- Roberts' apartment was clean.

556
00:52:20,360 --> 00:52:23,033
Been there 6 months,
neighbors barely remember him.

557
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:24,713
Where'd he work?

558
00:52:25,160 --> 00:52:26,878
- I'm going there next.
- How about now?

559
00:52:28,880 --> 00:52:30,359
What about the zip gun?

560
00:52:30,640 --> 00:52:34,713
We covered workers at the Bureau of
Prisons who could've planted it...

561
00:52:34,960 --> 00:52:36,996
...except for one guy, Kevin Peters.

562
00:52:37,320 --> 00:52:40,232
<i>- Out on sick leave.</i>
- Find him. Check them all out again.

563
00:52:40,560 --> 00:52:43,597
I want to go through their families,
their associates...

564
00:52:43,880 --> 00:52:45,199
<i>... changes in personal habits...</i>

565
00:52:45,480 --> 00:52:46,879
...bank records, medical,
the works.

566
00:52:47,160 --> 00:52:49,833
<i>- Stand on them till one squeaks.</i>
- I'm on it.

567
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:14,555
To see you walk in...

568
00:53:14,840 --> 00:53:18,719
...was like a mainline of ego boost.
I must've done something right...

569
00:53:19,080 --> 00:53:21,275
...to see you come all the way here
in one piece.

570
00:53:21,560 --> 00:53:23,391
It was all you, Sarge.

571
00:53:23,640 --> 00:53:27,030
Little birds talking
about big dollars to bring you in.

572
00:53:27,720 --> 00:53:28,630
Dead or alive?

573
00:53:28,920 --> 00:53:30,558
Emphasis on dead.

574
00:53:31,080 --> 00:53:32,479
On the plane, they tried.

575
00:53:33,000 --> 00:53:34,672
Almost succeeded too.

576
00:53:37,560 --> 00:53:38,515
You tempted?

577
00:53:38,960 --> 00:53:40,791
If you're the traitor they say you are.

578
00:53:41,080 --> 00:53:42,991
That's bullshit.

579
00:53:43,920 --> 00:53:46,354
- I got set up from the word "go."
- By who?

580
00:53:46,640 --> 00:53:48,358
That's what I got to figure out.

581
00:53:49,040 --> 00:53:50,837
It's somebody on the inside.

582
00:53:51,920 --> 00:53:55,037
Got instructions by the usual channels.
Supposed to make a drop-off.

583
00:53:55,280 --> 00:53:56,633
Then all hell breaks loose.

584
00:53:58,480 --> 00:54:00,038
I thought I could disappear.

585
00:54:01,640 --> 00:54:03,039
Boy, was I wrong.

586
00:54:03,440 --> 00:54:04,270
Your next move?

587
00:54:07,200 --> 00:54:11,113
Find the Chinese bagman from the
U.N. Garage and hope he leads me...

588
00:54:11,440 --> 00:54:12,589
...to whoever set me up.

589
00:54:13,560 --> 00:54:14,470
Get righteous again.

590
00:54:14,960 --> 00:54:15,995
How will you do that?

591
00:54:16,280 --> 00:54:18,077
I got ideas. Got the stuff?

592
00:54:25,720 --> 00:54:27,119
It's clean.

593
00:54:33,440 --> 00:54:34,429
The key?

594
00:54:46,280 --> 00:54:47,349
Take it all.

595
00:54:47,720 --> 00:54:49,472
I don't want you back here again.

596
00:54:49,960 --> 00:54:50,995
You don't believe me?

597
00:54:51,280 --> 00:54:53,236
I've gone as far as I'm prepared to go.

598
00:54:53,680 --> 00:54:55,671
I'll catch the rest on CNN.

599
00:54:58,520 --> 00:54:59,953
Good luck to you, man.

600
00:55:16,520 --> 00:55:18,033
You're a lucky guy.

601
00:55:19,000 --> 00:55:20,831
The old lady just kicked...

602
00:55:21,160 --> 00:55:22,752
...day before yesterday.

603
00:55:27,240 --> 00:55:28,673
I'll move out what you don't want.

604
00:55:39,280 --> 00:55:40,508
It's perfect.

605
00:56:01,880 --> 00:56:04,314
- What do you got?
<i>- We're in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania.</i>

606
00:56:04,560 --> 00:56:06,232
<i>We got this guy says our fugitive...</i>

607
00:56:06,560 --> 00:56:08,232
...jumped him near Eddyville, Kentucky.

608
00:56:08,560 --> 00:56:10,710
Tied him up and stuffed him
in his own camper.

609
00:56:11,080 --> 00:56:11,910
How long?

610
00:56:12,200 --> 00:56:13,269
Let me find out.

611
00:56:13,520 --> 00:56:15,272
- How long was he in there?
- 6 hours.

612
00:56:15,600 --> 00:56:16,874
6 hours.

613
00:56:17,160 --> 00:56:20,630
What do you want? We're exhausted.
We haven't slept for 2 days.

614
00:56:20,920 --> 00:56:22,797
Stay on the trail.
Sleep next month.

615
00:56:24,440 --> 00:56:26,795
Biggs and Cooper found a guy
tied up in his truck...

616
00:56:27,040 --> 00:56:28,553
...who I.D.'d our man.

617
00:56:30,320 --> 00:56:33,835
Harrisburg. Seems he is heading north.
Maybe now you'll start listening to me.

618
00:56:34,280 --> 00:56:38,910
Explain why a ruthless assassin keeps
going out of his way to let people live.

619
00:56:42,000 --> 00:56:42,955
We're right on it.

620
00:56:43,240 --> 00:56:44,070
What's up?

621
00:56:44,360 --> 00:56:45,270
Found his lady.

622
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:50,434
Where the hell is...?

623
00:56:59,080 --> 00:57:00,149
Marie Bineaux?

624
00:57:00,520 --> 00:57:02,112
- Yes?
- U.S. Marshals.

625
00:57:03,440 --> 00:57:04,350
What's this about?

626
00:57:04,720 --> 00:57:06,711
Just a few questions.
May we come in?

627
00:57:10,000 --> 00:57:10,910
Just a second.

628
00:57:15,160 --> 00:57:16,115
Thank you.

629
00:57:23,120 --> 00:57:24,348
What do you want?

630
00:57:24,680 --> 00:57:26,193
You recognize this man?

631
00:57:28,240 --> 00:57:29,878
Never seen him before.

632
00:57:31,480 --> 00:57:32,356
- Excuse me.
- Really?

633
00:57:32,720 --> 00:57:33,709
No.

634
00:57:34,720 --> 00:57:35,994
You sure about that?

635
00:57:37,160 --> 00:57:39,196
Yes. Sorry.

636
00:57:39,880 --> 00:57:42,758
This is a receipt from Chicago Memorial
for a Mark Warren.

637
00:57:43,640 --> 00:57:45,790
Paid in full. Is that your signature?

638
00:57:46,320 --> 00:57:48,151
We can verify your signature.

639
00:57:49,960 --> 00:57:51,029
Are you here legally?

640
00:57:51,280 --> 00:57:53,111
Familiar with
harboring and abetting laws?

641
00:57:53,720 --> 00:57:55,631
That's five to ten years.

642
00:57:55,880 --> 00:57:57,393
Then they kick you out.

643
00:57:57,680 --> 00:58:00,797
Why are you threatening me?
Even if I knew this man...

644
00:58:01,320 --> 00:58:03,038
...that's no crime.
I've done nothing wrong.

645
00:58:03,280 --> 00:58:04,793
Mark Roberts has.

646
00:58:06,280 --> 00:58:07,395
DSS Special Agent...

647
00:58:07,760 --> 00:58:08,909
...Sam Harmon.

648
00:58:09,320 --> 00:58:11,959
Your friend killed him
with his bare hands.

649
00:58:12,360 --> 00:58:13,759
Sam was a friend of mine.

650
00:58:14,680 --> 00:58:16,272
So was Neil Kasinski.

651
00:58:17,280 --> 00:58:19,510
- Neil had 3 kids.
- Stop doing this to me!

652
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:21,109
I don't know anything.

653
00:58:21,680 --> 00:58:24,956
I haven't heard from him and I won't.
I haven't seen him.

654
00:58:26,160 --> 00:58:27,513
So you do know him.

655
00:58:27,800 --> 00:58:29,233
- You lied to us.
- A federal offense.

656
00:58:33,840 --> 00:58:37,435
Put those things away. That's enough.
I'm sorry if we upset you.

657
00:58:38,000 --> 00:58:39,956
If you have the need,
you can call me...

658
00:58:40,720 --> 00:58:41,630
...at this number.

659
00:58:44,120 --> 00:58:45,473
Did you do that painting?

660
00:58:46,400 --> 00:58:47,799
Beautiful.

661
00:58:48,040 --> 00:58:50,076
You have talent.
I love the little airplane.

662
00:58:51,480 --> 00:58:52,799
Who took this photograph?

663
00:58:53,040 --> 00:58:54,871
- A friend of mine.
- He's good.

664
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:56,190
Who said it's a he?

665
00:58:56,520 --> 00:58:58,670
Nobody. I just figured.
I mean, you look so...

666
00:58:59,080 --> 00:59:00,115
...happy.

667
00:59:02,280 --> 00:59:03,554
If that's all...

668
00:59:04,440 --> 00:59:05,475
...I need to get to work.

669
00:59:06,160 --> 00:59:07,354
Let's go, guys.

670
00:59:09,200 --> 00:59:10,235
You're wrong about him.

671
00:59:10,800 --> 00:59:11,835
How's that?

672
00:59:12,200 --> 00:59:14,714
This is not a man who could've done
the things you said.

673
00:59:15,760 --> 00:59:19,355
This is a killer who committed murder
and probably will again.

674
00:59:19,640 --> 00:59:21,915
He'll do anything
and use anybody to escape.

675
00:59:22,160 --> 00:59:23,798
I'm glad you won't see him anymore.

676
00:59:33,080 --> 00:59:34,433
That was good work.

677
00:59:34,680 --> 00:59:35,510
Yes, it was.

678
00:59:35,760 --> 00:59:38,069
Newman, set up a surveillance
on Ms. Bineaux.

679
00:59:38,360 --> 00:59:41,432
- Get a tap order for here and at work.
- He won't make that mistake.

680
00:59:41,720 --> 00:59:43,711
He'll contact her.
I'll bet my Bears tickets.

681
00:59:48,360 --> 00:59:49,554
Kevin Peters...

682
00:59:49,800 --> 00:59:53,110
...the guy who was out sick,
must be the one who planted the gun.

683
00:59:53,440 --> 00:59:56,716
2 days before the plane crash,
his sister gets 20K in her account.

684
00:59:57,680 --> 00:59:58,430
Where is he?

685
00:59:58,720 --> 01:00:02,235
At the gym. Must have been one of those
24-minute viruses.

686
01:00:02,760 --> 01:00:04,432
Royce, go with Newman.

687
01:00:04,880 --> 01:00:06,757
Get me those U.N. Surveillance tapes.

688
01:00:22,160 --> 01:00:25,914
I haven't worked out in months.
I got to get my fat ass back to a gym.

689
01:00:26,160 --> 01:00:27,673
Yeah, you're getting old.

690
01:00:28,040 --> 01:00:29,075
And weak.

691
01:00:33,040 --> 01:00:34,678
Gym of the Living Dead, huh?

692
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:38,189
Hi, how you doing?

693
01:00:38,880 --> 01:00:40,393
U.S. Marshals.

694
01:00:42,120 --> 01:00:43,473
See this guy around?

695
01:00:47,080 --> 01:00:49,469
I think he's the last one here.
Check the showers.

696
01:00:49,720 --> 01:00:52,393
Thanks. I'll go check out over there.

697
01:01:08,280 --> 01:01:09,759
Kevin Peters?

698
01:01:24,040 --> 01:01:25,598
I got a dead guy here! Come on!

699
01:01:34,240 --> 01:01:38,677
Damn! The dude we just lost is the guy
who set up the zip gun hit on the plane.

700
01:01:38,960 --> 01:01:42,635
I don't get this. What's the connection
between the Chinese and our fugitive?

701
01:01:43,480 --> 01:01:46,995
Get me the U.S. Marshal's office.
We got a homicide.

702
01:01:54,520 --> 01:01:55,714
Where's the coffee?

703
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:57,916
Someone's calling
on her boss' cell phone.

704
01:01:58,200 --> 01:02:00,031
Carla, get us a lock on that call.

705
01:02:07,120 --> 01:02:09,190
<i>Mark, it was horrible.</i>
<i>The police found me.</i>
