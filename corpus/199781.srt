1
00:00:44,811 --> 00:00:47,473
Horrible monkey!
Stand still!

2
00:00:49,516 --> 00:00:51,347
Quick!
Don't let him get away!

3
00:00:51,484 --> 00:00:52,576
Mind that gold staff he carries!

4
00:00:54,521 --> 00:00:55,488
You asked for it!

5
00:00:55,622 --> 00:00:57,681
Think you can have a birthday party
without inviting me?

6
00:00:57,824 --> 00:00:59,382
Think again!

7
00:01:00,026 --> 00:01:02,187
No birthday party swings
without my gold staff!

8
00:01:10,570 --> 00:01:12,629
Damn it!

9
00:01:24,884 --> 00:01:27,250
Now it's your turn!
Get down!

10
00:01:34,861 --> 00:01:37,694
I've had enough of this

11
00:01:51,277 --> 00:01:52,972
Don't let him slip away!

12
00:02:32,886 --> 00:02:34,353
You unruly little monkey!

13
00:02:34,487 --> 00:02:36,648
How dare you break into the Palace
and eat the Peaches ofHeaven?

14
00:02:38,191 --> 00:02:40,182
You'll pay the price for this
wickedness!

15
00:02:40,326 --> 00:02:42,021
In the name of Buddha, I will bind
you for five hundred years!

16
00:02:42,162 --> 00:02:43,595
You must accompany the monk
Tripitaka on his Journey to the West

17
00:02:43,730 --> 00:02:47,325
He travels in search of sacred
Buddhist scriptures

18
00:02:48,601 --> 00:02:51,627
You will wear this Ring ofPain
from now on

19
00:02:51,771 --> 00:02:53,204
If you get up to any mischief, the ring
will squeeze your head like a lemon!

20
00:02:53,339 --> 00:02:54,101
You must be kidding!

21
00:02:54,240 --> 00:02:57,175
If you don't shut up, I'll show you
the power of my gold staff!

22
00:02:58,278 --> 00:03:00,007
Leave me alone!

23
00:03:00,146 --> 00:03:01,443
Stop it, or I'll knock your block off!

24
00:03:02,048 --> 00:03:09,819
One, two, three...

25
00:04:05,945 --> 00:04:07,105
Wow, you're cute

26
00:04:58,398 --> 00:05:01,595
Wula!

27
00:05:05,872 --> 00:05:07,703
No, Wula!
This is Little Dragon

28
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,705
He'll be your new best friend

29
00:05:17,150 --> 00:05:19,118
Little Dragon, this is home!

30
00:05:26,192 --> 00:05:27,887
Where have you hidden it?

31
00:05:28,428 --> 00:05:30,123
Give me that Iron Fan!

32
00:05:30,997 --> 00:05:32,157
No, I won't!

33
00:05:32,298 --> 00:05:35,028
It's a precious family treasure

34
00:05:35,168 --> 00:05:36,726
I won't let you lose it by

35
00:05:36,869 --> 00:05:39,838
"Precious family treasure"?

36
00:05:40,740 --> 00:05:43,538
Will you give it to me or will
you force me to take it?

37
00:05:49,482 --> 00:05:50,949
Dad, Mama's sick!

38
00:05:51,084 --> 00:05:52,745
Don't treat her like that!

39
00:05:54,220 --> 00:05:55,187
I can do without lessons from you!

40
00:05:55,321 --> 00:05:58,415
Dad, the fire on Mount Flame is
much worse now

41
00:05:58,558 --> 00:06:02,016
So what? Your mother could
deal with it easily!

42
00:06:06,332 --> 00:06:08,095
Why does Wula have to pee
everywhere?

43
00:06:17,477 --> 00:06:18,444
What a bad father!

44
00:06:20,847 --> 00:06:22,508
Darling, we have to keep that
secret

45
00:06:22,648 --> 00:06:24,138
Otherwise people will laugh at us

46
00:06:25,618 --> 00:06:26,676
Mama!

47
00:06:28,187 --> 00:06:30,018
I'm sorry... Don't be angry

48
00:06:30,923 --> 00:06:32,083
Red, you're a good son

49
00:06:32,225 --> 00:06:33,920
Now look at all these herbs
I've found for you!

50
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:36,255
You're sure to get well now

51
00:06:37,296 --> 00:06:41,255
Very good, boy! You've found
everything I need

52
00:06:50,109 --> 00:06:52,441
Red, where did you find this dragon?

53
00:06:52,578 --> 00:06:53,442
Cute, isn't he?

54
00:06:53,579 --> 00:06:54,341
I was out picking the herbs...

55
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:56,380
Suddenly a fireball came out of
the sky...

56
00:06:56,516 --> 00:06:58,108
When it hit the ground it was
like a volcano...

57
00:06:58,251 --> 00:06:59,548
A volcano running for miles and miles!

58
00:07:00,353 --> 00:07:03,345
And then this little dragon just
plopped down beside me!

59
00:07:03,990 --> 00:07:05,480
You're making up stories again!

60
00:07:05,625 --> 00:07:06,523
No, Mama, it's true

61
00:07:06,659 --> 00:07:08,456
Come outside and I'll show you

62
00:07:12,598 --> 00:07:14,122
See, over there!

63
00:07:14,834 --> 00:07:17,132
You think the fire can reach us here?

64
00:07:17,570 --> 00:07:19,936
Don't worry, we have my precious
Iron F an

65
00:07:25,311 --> 00:07:27,973
Princess, time for your medicine

66
00:07:28,114 --> 00:07:29,638
Here, let me help you Mama

67
00:07:34,086 --> 00:07:36,213
There you go
Thank you

68
00:07:39,692 --> 00:07:41,023
What an illness!

69
00:07:41,928 --> 00:07:44,624
Ugh, it feels as if I've been
taking this medicine all my life!

70
00:07:44,764 --> 00:07:46,664
Why don't I get any better?

71
00:07:46,799 --> 00:07:51,133
Princess, you could say this medicine
has a kill-to-cure aspect...

72
00:07:51,270 --> 00:07:53,204
What are you trying to say?

73
00:07:53,339 --> 00:07:55,034
Well, the thing is...

74
00:07:56,476 --> 00:07:58,910
T o be really effective, it needs
one more ingredient...

75
00:07:59,045 --> 00:08:00,910
Ground bone of monk!

76
00:08:01,047 --> 00:08:02,275
Ground bone of monk?

77
00:08:02,415 --> 00:08:04,144
Where on earth can I find that?

78
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:07,047
Well, I hear from a very reliable
source that 500 years from now...

79
00:08:07,186 --> 00:08:09,814
...the holy monk Tripitaka will
pass this way...

80
00:08:09,956 --> 00:08:12,254
...on his quest to find a sacred scroll

81
00:08:12,391 --> 00:08:14,723
He'll provide the only chance to
cure your mother

82
00:08:14,861 --> 00:08:17,853
There is only one Tripitaka! T o get
ground bone of monk, you'll need to...

83
00:08:17,997 --> 00:08:19,862
Catch the monk!
Bingo!

84
00:08:19,999 --> 00:08:22,092
But a 500-year wait!

85
00:08:22,235 --> 00:08:24,430
Haven't you ever heard
'As Time Goes By'?

86
00:08:24,570 --> 00:08:25,935
500 years seems like a long time

87
00:08:26,072 --> 00:08:29,098
But it'll pass in a flash if you
spend it getting ready

88
00:09:09,949 --> 00:09:11,507
Hey, this butterfly is Pigsy!

89
00:10:06,072 --> 00:10:07,300
Stop!

90
00:10:10,876 --> 00:10:13,572
We have promised Buddha...

91
00:10:13,713 --> 00:10:16,147
...that we'll reach the West
under our own steam

92
00:10:16,282 --> 00:10:20,150
We don't take shortcuts!
Understand?

93
00:11:21,047 --> 00:11:21,877
Wait!

94
00:11:23,282 --> 00:11:24,806
Monkey, do not kill any living creature

95
00:13:35,514 --> 00:13:37,175
Master, this place is weird

96
00:13:37,316 --> 00:13:38,408
Watch out!

97
00:13:40,786 --> 00:13:44,085
Amitabha!

98
00:14:33,672 --> 00:14:35,196
Master!

99
00:15:04,370 --> 00:15:05,428
I'll get you!

100
00:15:06,538 --> 00:15:08,631
I'll flatten you!

101
00:15:13,879 --> 00:15:16,541
Sorry, may I leave this here?

102
00:15:21,954 --> 00:15:22,943
Monkey, watch out!

103
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:26,289
Nice move, Monkeyboy!

104
00:15:26,425 --> 00:15:28,484
Where'd this little devil come from?

105
00:15:28,627 --> 00:15:30,720
You dare to block my way?

106
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,331
T alk about a wild animal!

107
00:15:33,465 --> 00:15:35,023
Who d'you think you are?

108
00:15:35,167 --> 00:15:37,135
Ever seen yourself in a mirror,
Monkeyboy?

109
00:15:38,237 --> 00:15:39,602
What are you on about?

110
00:15:40,572 --> 00:15:41,197
And who could that be?

111
00:15:41,340 --> 00:15:44,605
Must be that dumb oaf Sandy!

112
00:15:45,644 --> 00:15:46,474
You think that's funny, Pork Pie?

113
00:15:46,612 --> 00:15:49,581
You must be Pigsy, the stupidest fatso!

114
00:15:50,683 --> 00:15:53,345
Whoever you are, I'll thank you
to mind your manners

115
00:16:00,859 --> 00:16:03,726
Wow, a pig lecturing me about manners!

116
00:16:03,862 --> 00:16:05,659
That's big news!

117
00:16:06,332 --> 00:16:09,096
Okay, enough of this!
Hand over the monk!

118
00:16:09,234 --> 00:16:10,633
Then I might let the rest of you live!
But if you don't...

119
00:16:11,437 --> 00:16:12,335
My child...

120
00:16:12,471 --> 00:16:14,803
I have done you no wrong

121
00:16:14,940 --> 00:16:16,032
What do you want with me?

122
00:16:16,175 --> 00:16:18,905
I need to grind your bones,
if you must know

123
00:16:19,945 --> 00:16:22,573
Have you completely lost it?
How can you grind a living man's bones?

124
00:16:24,416 --> 00:16:29,820
No problem, he'll die first

125
00:16:29,955 --> 00:16:31,445
I've been waiting for you for 500 years!

126
00:16:32,024 --> 00:16:34,720
Monk, you'd better give yourself up!

127
00:16:34,860 --> 00:16:36,589
You think so? No way!

128
00:16:36,729 --> 00:16:39,857
Get a load of this!

129
00:17:24,176 --> 00:17:25,700
You're so heavy, you tub of lard!

130
00:17:25,844 --> 00:17:27,539
Get off me!

131
00:17:28,847 --> 00:17:30,872
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...

132
00:17:31,950 --> 00:17:33,542
Bacon breath!

133
00:17:35,220 --> 00:17:36,209
(out)

134
00:17:38,891 --> 00:17:40,051
Here you are...

135
00:17:40,192 --> 00:17:41,352
That's mine, give it back

136
00:17:41,927 --> 00:17:43,519
Brother! Hang on to it!

137
00:17:45,664 --> 00:17:47,461
Let go, you pork chop on legs!

138
00:17:47,599 --> 00:17:49,089
No!

139
00:17:52,371 --> 00:17:54,999
Let go, bacon breath! Let go!

140
00:17:56,275 --> 00:17:58,038
You're fighting the wrong guy, kid

141
00:17:58,177 --> 00:18:00,111
If you want a real scrap,
he's your man... not me

142
00:18:00,245 --> 00:18:02,679
Let go!
Brother Monkey, help me!

143
00:18:07,953 --> 00:18:09,352
You should fight Monkey

144
00:18:09,488 --> 00:18:11,718
I'm not the monkey, I'm a pig

145
00:18:11,857 --> 00:18:13,085
A smelly pig

146
00:18:13,225 --> 00:18:16,786
Let go, streaky bacon!
Let go right now!

147
00:18:27,840 --> 00:18:30,070
Drat! Can't let him get away!

148
00:18:34,580 --> 00:18:35,945
Where'd he go?

149
00:18:56,768 --> 00:18:58,736
T ake that!

150
00:18:59,638 --> 00:19:01,606
Little devil, you got it coming!

151
00:19:25,764 --> 00:19:28,528
Sharp toothpicks you use!

152
00:19:36,775 --> 00:19:39,608
Think you're grown up, kid?

153
00:19:39,745 --> 00:19:42,145
Now you're unarmed!
What are you gonna do?

154
00:19:42,281 --> 00:19:45,307
You wanna challenge me?
You need another 300 years of practice!

155
00:19:45,751 --> 00:19:47,343
Catch!

156
00:19:48,954 --> 00:19:49,978
Thanks!

157
00:19:55,360 --> 00:19:57,225
Oh!

158
00:20:08,040 --> 00:20:09,507
Here...

159
00:20:14,780 --> 00:20:16,680
I Give up now, Monkeyboy!

160
00:20:16,815 --> 00:20:18,578
You talkin' to me?
I'll show you

161
00:20:22,554 --> 00:20:23,919
Protect the Master!

162
00:20:52,684 --> 00:20:54,015
Fire...

163
00:20:55,520 --> 00:20:57,317
Help!

164
00:20:57,456 --> 00:21:01,119
Y es, water! Water!

165
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:10,798
My pal's faster than yours!
You need years more practice!

166
00:21:33,025 --> 00:21:34,856
Monkeyboy!

167
00:22:04,990 --> 00:22:06,981
Do your worst!
I can dowse your flame!

168
00:22:07,125 --> 00:22:08,854
No, Cloud, don't mess with him

169
00:22:14,933 --> 00:22:16,423
Lost your sizzle?

170
00:22:16,568 --> 00:22:18,297
Monkey!

171
00:22:22,741 --> 00:22:23,935
Monkey...

172
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:26,277
Cloud!

173
00:22:36,822 --> 00:22:39,382
He could be useful to me!

174
00:22:55,240 --> 00:22:58,107
Okay, now hand over that monk!

175
00:23:01,380 --> 00:23:03,143
You are a good son to your parents

176
00:23:03,281 --> 00:23:05,408
Harming others to get your

177
00:23:05,550 --> 00:23:07,279
own way is wrong

178
00:23:07,419 --> 00:23:10,115
You will meditate on your mistakes
for three years

179
00:23:14,526 --> 00:23:15,515
Three years?

180
00:23:15,660 --> 00:23:17,958
What about my Mama?

181
00:23:25,170 --> 00:23:26,933
Quick! The Great Buddha is
before us!

182
00:23:27,339 --> 00:23:29,204
The Great Buddha is before us!

183
00:23:32,677 --> 00:23:35,043
I don't want...

184
00:23:35,347 --> 00:23:38,373
Show some respect, Pork Pie!

185
00:23:38,517 --> 00:23:41,975
Thank you, Lord Buddha!

186
00:24:13,018 --> 00:24:14,076
Look, Master, we can't go on!

187
00:24:14,219 --> 00:24:15,481
We'd better turn back
and go home

188
00:24:15,620 --> 00:24:18,953
There is always a way

189
00:24:19,090 --> 00:24:20,182
Monkey, you and Pigsy scout the area
See if there's a way around

190
00:24:20,325 --> 00:24:22,816
I'll look this way with Sandy

191
00:24:22,961 --> 00:24:24,189
Oh, all right

192
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,224
Come on, Pork Pie

193
00:24:39,945 --> 00:24:41,936
Couldn't I just nip home first?

194
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,741
I just remembered...

195
00:24:43,882 --> 00:24:46,578
I think I forgot to turn off
the gas...

196
00:24:48,487 --> 00:24:50,478
Look, Porker! There's an oasis!

197
00:24:50,622 --> 00:24:52,317
Let's go back and tell Master

198
00:25:34,766 --> 00:25:37,132
There must be someone around

199
00:25:37,269 --> 00:25:38,736
Pigsy, you look around the place

200
00:25:39,571 --> 00:25:40,833
Okay, I'm on it

201
00:25:50,415 --> 00:25:52,178
Anybody home?

202
00:25:54,553 --> 00:25:55,815
Who's there?

203
00:25:59,524 --> 00:26:00,752
Oh boy, a water hole!

204
00:26:05,363 --> 00:26:08,093
Don't, Pigsy!
The water could be poisoned!

205
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:09,564
Don't drink it!

206
00:26:22,847 --> 00:26:25,077
Who is...

207
00:26:25,216 --> 00:26:26,410
Master Mud!

208
00:26:27,152 --> 00:26:28,642
Welcome!

209
00:26:28,787 --> 00:26:31,654
Good to meet you, Master Mud

210
00:26:32,257 --> 00:26:36,159
I'm honored to be visited
by Master Tripitaka

211
00:26:37,429 --> 00:26:41,490
But please don't bathe there,
that water is very precious

212
00:26:43,234 --> 00:26:45,429
Pigsy, come out at once

213
00:26:50,642 --> 00:26:51,472
What's with this place?

214
00:26:51,610 --> 00:26:53,237
How come it's so hot?

215
00:26:53,378 --> 00:26:56,176
Is there no way
to cross those mountains?

216
00:26:57,082 --> 00:26:59,710
There is a way, but it's very difficult

217
00:26:59,851 --> 00:27:01,443
You need to get the Iron F an

218
00:27:01,586 --> 00:27:04,714
T o cross the mountains, you need
to put out the fires first

219
00:27:07,025 --> 00:27:08,492
What Iron F an is that?

220
00:27:08,627 --> 00:27:11,027
It belongs to Princess Iron F an
of the Banana Cave

221
00:27:11,162 --> 00:27:12,823
It's her family heirloom

222
00:27:12,964 --> 00:27:15,592
It's the only thing that can
put out those fires

223
00:27:15,734 --> 00:27:17,031
The Banana Cave?

224
00:27:17,869 --> 00:27:21,396
That's right, Princess Iron Fan
and her husband Ox

225
00:27:21,539 --> 00:27:25,066
They live in the Banana Cave,
300 leagues from here

226
00:27:26,645 --> 00:27:30,581
That's great!

227
00:27:30,715 --> 00:27:33,343
Ox and I are old buddies!
We go back 500 years!

228
00:27:33,785 --> 00:27:34,979
Cloud...

229
00:27:38,189 --> 00:27:39,486
Let's go!

230
00:27:45,730 --> 00:27:47,391
What is it, Wula?

231
00:27:56,608 --> 00:27:58,838
Scuse me, Ma'am, is Ox at home?

232
00:27:58,977 --> 00:28:02,071
No, he's out...
Are you Monkey?

233
00:28:03,114 --> 00:28:06,550
You must be the famously gorgeous
and smart Mrs Ox! Right, babe?

234
00:28:06,685 --> 00:28:08,414
How dare you burst in here!

235
00:28:09,320 --> 00:28:11,720
Aw, don't be like that, Sis

236
00:28:11,856 --> 00:28:14,086
Ain't it cool to have a handsome guy
show up on your doorstep?

237
00:28:14,225 --> 00:28:16,489
Enough of your nonsense!
Where's my son?

238
00:28:17,195 --> 00:28:17,718
Your son?

239
00:28:17,862 --> 00:28:18,794
Don't feign innocence!

240
00:28:18,930 --> 00:28:21,524
Red went out looking for you
and he hasn't come back

241
00:28:22,467 --> 00:28:23,934
Why was he attacking my Master?

242
00:28:24,069 --> 00:28:26,196
So you have got him!

243
00:28:26,838 --> 00:28:28,897
Cool it, Dame

244
00:28:29,040 --> 00:28:30,166
He asked for it

245
00:28:30,308 --> 00:28:31,570
He tried to kill my Master!

246
00:28:31,710 --> 00:28:33,473
Buddha himself
locked him up to punish him

247
00:28:33,611 --> 00:28:34,771
That's absurd!

248
00:28:34,913 --> 00:28:37,438
Red is smart, cute and sensible

249
00:28:38,850 --> 00:28:39,782
Hang about, Sis

250
00:28:39,918 --> 00:28:41,943
Your nose is getting longer!

251
00:28:42,087 --> 00:28:43,281
Why are you here?

252
00:28:43,421 --> 00:28:45,821
The fire in the mountains
is blocking our way

253
00:28:45,957 --> 00:28:46,423
So?

254
00:28:46,558 --> 00:28:49,686
We need your Iron F an to blow it out

255
00:28:51,129 --> 00:28:54,428
Give me back my son,
and I'll let you use the fan

256
00:28:55,734 --> 00:28:56,530
Don't worry about him

257
00:28:56,668 --> 00:28:58,727
He's safe in Buddha's hands

258
00:28:58,870 --> 00:29:00,337
Listen, Ape!
You come here behaving like this...

259
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,804
...and expect me to do you a favor?

260
00:29:03,274 --> 00:29:06,402
Behave yourself and accept my proposal!

261
00:29:06,544 --> 00:29:08,842
Or would you rather go home?

262
00:29:09,314 --> 00:29:11,111
Do you want the Iron F an or not?

263
00:29:13,051 --> 00:29:14,109
As you wish!

264
00:29:14,252 --> 00:29:16,777
I'll show you the power of the Iron F an!

265
00:29:17,355 --> 00:29:22,816
Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

266
00:29:43,448 --> 00:29:45,382
Oh, it's you again! Wondered
where you'd slithered off to

267
00:29:49,587 --> 00:29:50,451
Scuse me!

268
00:29:50,588 --> 00:29:51,520
I'd love to hang with you,

269
00:29:51,656 --> 00:29:52,884
but I got places to go,
people to see...

270
00:29:53,024 --> 00:29:54,491
Bye bye!

271
00:30:16,314 --> 00:30:18,111
Fooled you!

272
00:30:45,777 --> 00:30:47,802
What's with all these trees?

273
00:30:55,153 --> 00:30:56,780
Buddha's in for a surprise!

274
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:20,834
It seems you're turning into
another naughty little Monkey

275
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:28,375
Let me see...

276
00:31:28,519 --> 00:31:32,046
What were you saying about me
being in for a surprise?

277
00:31:32,190 --> 00:31:33,851
Buddha, please don't be angry

278
00:31:33,992 --> 00:31:35,357
I was just kidding

279
00:31:35,894 --> 00:31:38,328
It looked to me
as if you were trying to escape

280
00:31:38,463 --> 00:31:40,988
I miss my Little Dragon

281
00:31:41,132 --> 00:31:43,794
And I'm worried about my Mama

282
00:31:44,469 --> 00:31:48,303
Dear child, I'll grant you a visit home

283
00:31:48,439 --> 00:31:51,374
But only if you'll promise me two things

284
00:31:51,509 --> 00:31:52,441
I'll promise!

285
00:31:54,345 --> 00:31:57,974
First, stop trying to
take Tripitaka's bones

286
00:31:58,783 --> 00:32:02,082
But Mama really needs them!

287
00:32:02,220 --> 00:32:04,950
She will recover without them

288
00:32:05,089 --> 00:32:07,023
Don't worry

289
00:32:07,158 --> 00:32:09,058
What do you mean?

290
00:32:10,228 --> 00:32:13,356
You'll find out when the time comes

291
00:32:13,932 --> 00:32:15,695
Okay, I promised

292
00:32:15,833 --> 00:32:17,494
And the second one?

293
00:32:18,269 --> 00:32:20,931
My palm is itchy

294
00:32:21,072 --> 00:32:23,438
Give me a good scratch before you go!
Is that all?

295
00:32:32,417 --> 00:32:35,648
Ah, that feels so good...

296
00:32:56,774 --> 00:32:57,706
Wula,

297
00:32:57,842 --> 00:32:59,639
you need a bath!

298
00:33:04,515 --> 00:33:06,779
Where did you pick up all these fleas?

299
00:33:06,918 --> 00:33:07,850
Stop playing, I'm serious
I don't like dirty fleas

300
00:33:07,986 --> 00:33:10,784
Princess! Time for your medicine!

301
00:33:10,922 --> 00:33:11,445
And when you've drunk it all down...

302
00:33:11,589 --> 00:33:15,491
...I'll give you a good massage

303
00:33:21,099 --> 00:33:22,930
Thank you for
taking such good care of me

304
00:33:23,334 --> 00:33:25,029
Princess, you flatter me

305
00:33:25,169 --> 00:33:27,330
Your health is my first and only concern

306
00:33:27,472 --> 00:33:28,734
You're welcome

307
00:33:28,873 --> 00:33:31,535
It's most efficacious
when it's hot, Princess

308
00:33:47,959 --> 00:33:49,551
I don't like the smell of this!

309
00:33:50,895 --> 00:33:52,123
Oh...

310
00:33:52,263 --> 00:33:53,628
My stomach is killing me!

311
00:33:56,768 --> 00:33:59,737
Killing... She ain't kidding!

312
00:34:01,039 --> 00:34:02,006
What's going on?

313
00:34:02,140 --> 00:34:04,108
Why is there a voice in my stomach?

314
00:34:05,243 --> 00:34:07,871
It's me, Monkey, paying you a visited

315
00:34:08,012 --> 00:34:10,776
You...
Come out of there right now, Monkey!

316
00:34:10,915 --> 00:34:13,406
What allows you to invade my insides?

317
00:34:13,551 --> 00:34:16,111
But I'm here,
so what are you going to do about it?

318
00:34:18,523 --> 00:34:21,583
You won't get rid of me
until you give me that Iron F an

319
00:34:21,726 --> 00:34:23,250
Come out first!

320
00:34:23,394 --> 00:34:25,988
No way! You think I was born yesterday?

321
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:27,825
First, give me the fan!
And hurry it up!

322
00:34:27,965 --> 00:34:30,934
Or I'll demonstrate my drumming skills!

323
00:34:31,069 --> 00:34:34,300
The drummer in the May Day band
learned all he knows from me!

324
00:34:34,772 --> 00:34:37,070
All right, all right!
Just stop that infernal drumming!

325
00:34:37,208 --> 00:34:38,766
I'll give you the Iron F an

326
00:34:50,888 --> 00:34:51,877
Great!

327
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:54,821
Now I need to know the spell
to make it bigger again

328
00:34:54,959 --> 00:34:57,928
You can't do that
while it's still inside me!

329
00:34:58,062 --> 00:34:59,188
I realise that

330
00:34:59,330 --> 00:35:00,558
All right then...

331
00:35:00,698 --> 00:35:02,393
So tell me the spell!

332
00:35:02,533 --> 00:35:03,830
I can't!

333
00:35:05,269 --> 00:35:06,429
Listen...

334
00:35:06,571 --> 00:35:07,333
Don't mess me around...

335
00:35:07,472 --> 00:35:09,963
...or you'll soon be
'breaking wind' as never before!

336
00:35:10,108 --> 00:35:12,201
No, no! It's just that...

337
00:35:12,343 --> 00:35:14,573
...I can't say it out loud.
I'll write it down for you

338
00:35:14,712 --> 00:35:17,647
Then I'll swallow it

339
00:35:26,524 --> 00:35:27,923
Now, will you come out?

340
00:35:29,927 --> 00:35:31,622
So this is the spell!

341
00:35:32,096 --> 00:35:34,724
I'll need some help...
Please sneeze!

342
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:37,893
Sneeze? I can't just sneeze to order!

343
00:35:38,035 --> 00:35:39,229
Wula, come here

344
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,338
Help me, I need a sneeze

345
00:35:43,441 --> 00:35:45,568
Not you, silly!

346
00:35:45,710 --> 00:35:48,577
I need you to help me sneeze!

347
00:36:02,760 --> 00:36:04,694
Thanks! Bye bye!

348
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:07,320
You damnable Monkey!

349
00:36:07,765 --> 00:36:09,756
By the way, Princess...

350
00:36:09,901 --> 00:36:12,028
What is that stinky toad giving you?

351
00:36:12,170 --> 00:36:15,731
Inside you,
it smells like something dead!

352
00:36:35,826 --> 00:36:36,884
Little dragon!

353
00:36:39,430 --> 00:36:40,522
Dragon...

354
00:36:40,998 --> 00:36:42,124
Dragon...

355
00:36:43,301 --> 00:36:45,599
Dragon...
Come, Dragon!

356
00:36:46,170 --> 00:36:47,728
Dinnertime!

357
00:37:01,319 --> 00:37:04,413
Come, my lovely Dragon!
Time to eat!

358
00:37:07,158 --> 00:37:09,217
Not so fast! Be good, and do as I say

359
00:37:09,360 --> 00:37:12,352
Then you can have your reward!
You can get high again!

360
00:37:12,496 --> 00:37:13,622
Down you go!

361
00:37:31,482 --> 00:37:34,542
Good boy!
This is the biggest you've found so far!

362
00:37:34,685 --> 00:37:38,815
Next time, dive even deeper...
Try even harder!

363
00:37:39,490 --> 00:37:42,687
Precious stones
are Spider's best friends!

364
00:37:45,062 --> 00:37:47,963
Isn't that just yummy?

365
00:37:49,200 --> 00:37:50,633
You bring me even bigger stones...

366
00:37:50,768 --> 00:37:53,703
...and I'll get you higher
than you've ever dreamed!

367
00:38:03,681 --> 00:38:05,376
Mission accomplished!

368
00:38:08,619 --> 00:38:09,608
Master!

369
00:38:09,754 --> 00:38:12,814
Good work, Monkey!
I knew the Princess would be generous

370
00:38:13,591 --> 00:38:15,582
You might say that!
Anyhow, you can count on me

371
00:38:16,127 --> 00:38:18,061
Oh boy, can I see it?

372
00:38:18,195 --> 00:38:21,187
Here it is!
T o use it, you need a good head

373
00:38:24,669 --> 00:38:27,832
Is that it? What good is
a tiddly little fan like that?

374
00:38:28,839 --> 00:38:32,900
Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

375
00:38:34,779 --> 00:38:36,576
Don't unerestimate that F an

376
00:38:36,714 --> 00:38:38,648
Say the right words and it changes!

377
00:38:38,783 --> 00:38:40,774
I've memorized them!

378
00:38:40,918 --> 00:38:42,442
Then all you have to is recite them

379
00:38:42,586 --> 00:38:44,816
T ake aim and wave the fan at Mount Flame

380
00:38:44,955 --> 00:38:48,447
Then the fires will die down

381
00:38:48,592 --> 00:38:51,823
Great! Let's give it a shot right now!

382
00:38:52,330 --> 00:38:53,854
But Monkey...

383
00:38:54,799 --> 00:38:55,959
Now what?

384
00:38:56,100 --> 00:38:57,795
You must remember...

385
00:38:57,935 --> 00:39:02,031
First blow for wind, second blow
for rain, third blow for fire

386
00:39:02,173 --> 00:39:04,164
But don't give it a fourth blow!

387
00:39:04,308 --> 00:39:07,368
That will make the F an destroy itself!

388
00:39:07,511 --> 00:39:09,638
That's enough gobbledegook!
The main thing is to put out the fire

389
00:39:09,780 --> 00:39:11,247
Who cares what happens to the F an?

390
00:39:19,256 --> 00:39:23,920
Monkey: Check it out!
Let's play BLOW game, baby.

391
00:39:26,063 --> 00:39:28,293
It works! The fire's been put out!

392
00:39:29,667 --> 00:39:31,999
Buddha be blessed

393
00:39:32,136 --> 00:39:34,502
Now, let's get going

394
00:39:37,541 --> 00:39:38,838
What the...? No way!

395
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,141
I'll try it again

396
00:40:02,666 --> 00:40:05,635
The Princess is really powerful!

397
00:40:05,770 --> 00:40:07,635
You're wasting our time!

398
00:40:07,772 --> 00:40:09,399
Don't laugh at me, Pigsy...

399
00:40:09,540 --> 00:40:11,098
...or I'll have you roasted!

400
00:40:15,079 --> 00:40:17,843
Monkey, don't be reckless!

401
00:40:19,116 --> 00:40:20,276
If I may make a suggestion...

402
00:40:20,418 --> 00:40:21,885
It might work better...

403
00:40:22,019 --> 00:40:25,113
...if Ox were holding it

404
00:40:25,656 --> 00:40:27,453
You could be right

405
00:40:27,591 --> 00:40:29,218
So where do I find Ox?

406
00:40:29,360 --> 00:40:32,227
Where would you expect
to find a compulsive gambler?

407
00:40:33,631 --> 00:40:35,326
Half Mountain Inn!

408
00:41:00,524 --> 00:41:03,186
That's lucky!

409
00:41:03,327 --> 00:41:05,887
Hey, Ox! Brother Ox!

410
00:41:12,670 --> 00:41:14,900
You want to get trampled to death?

411
00:41:15,039 --> 00:41:16,233
Ox, my old pal!

412
00:41:16,774 --> 00:41:17,968
Monkey...

413
00:41:18,409 --> 00:41:20,070
It's good that you showed up!

414
00:41:20,211 --> 00:41:22,202
I have a score to settle with you!

415
00:41:22,713 --> 00:41:24,908
Where is my son? I know you're
to blame for his disappearance

416
00:41:25,483 --> 00:41:27,075
Tell me where he is!

417
00:41:27,218 --> 00:41:30,119
Well, I guess I did have
a little something to do with it

418
00:41:30,621 --> 00:41:33,351
You can have something
to do with my pitchfork!

419
00:41:34,124 --> 00:41:36,285
Come on, Ox...

420
00:41:39,063 --> 00:41:40,121
Let me explain!

421
00:41:40,264 --> 00:41:42,596
Smash first, explain later

422
00:41:44,368 --> 00:41:46,131
Ox, let me explain!

423
00:41:46,270 --> 00:41:49,433
You gave me choice,
it was for your own good!

424
00:41:54,278 --> 00:41:56,109
That's ridiculous!

425
00:41:56,247 --> 00:41:58,112
Listen, Ox, we all know
how much you like gambling

426
00:41:58,249 --> 00:42:00,615
None of your business!

427
00:42:01,218 --> 00:42:03,846
And how you always lose!

428
00:42:04,555 --> 00:42:06,682
You're asking for it!

429
00:42:15,165 --> 00:42:17,725
Hey, lay off my trusty steed!

430
00:42:17,868 --> 00:42:19,130
Will you listen?

431
00:42:19,270 --> 00:42:21,033
I got your boy a gig with Buddha!

432
00:42:21,171 --> 00:42:23,298
He even has an official job title

433
00:42:23,440 --> 00:42:25,032
What job title?

434
00:42:26,577 --> 00:42:28,477
Buddha's little Fortune Teller

435
00:42:28,612 --> 00:42:30,443
Oh yeah?
I'd rather he was a Fortune Bringer!

436
00:42:31,448 --> 00:42:36,215
You're missing the point!

437
00:42:36,353 --> 00:42:39,584
Your son is loaded with fortunes!

438
00:42:39,723 --> 00:42:41,588
So, with a little help from Buddha...

439
00:42:41,725 --> 00:42:43,818
...you won't ever lose again!

440
00:42:43,961 --> 00:42:45,622
Or you can call me Monkey!

441
00:42:45,763 --> 00:42:47,663
Right...

442
00:42:47,798 --> 00:42:50,426
I've lost all my crickets...

443
00:42:51,168 --> 00:42:53,102
Don't worry, I give you my word

444
00:42:53,237 --> 00:42:56,832
Whatever game you play, you'll win

445
00:42:56,974 --> 00:42:58,464
Let me handle it! Let's go!

446
00:43:00,578 --> 00:43:02,068
Okay, let's go!

447
00:43:03,113 --> 00:43:04,580
I'll go along with this

448
00:43:04,715 --> 00:43:06,842
But if you happen to see my boy,
please tell him...

449
00:43:06,984 --> 00:43:09,452
...I really respect what he's doing

450
00:43:09,587 --> 00:43:13,353
He should study hard
and become a decent man

451
00:43:14,124 --> 00:43:15,921
And if he lets slip any secrets
of the fortune-making kind...

452
00:43:16,060 --> 00:43:19,325
...he can drop me a line
or send me an e-mail

453
00:43:20,297 --> 00:43:24,996
Of course, you'll be the first to know!

454
00:43:28,839 --> 00:43:31,433
Dragon has become
hopelessly addicted to the potion

455
00:43:31,575 --> 00:43:33,236
But I can't rely only on Dragon

456
00:43:33,377 --> 00:43:35,937
You must act quickly!

457
00:43:36,080 --> 00:43:37,945
Sure, but I need to be cunning too

458
00:43:38,082 --> 00:43:39,811
I need to learn the secret spell

459
00:43:39,950 --> 00:43:42,282
Otherwise I won't be able to do anything

460
00:43:42,419 --> 00:43:46,219
Once I get it, everything will be fine!

461
00:43:46,824 --> 00:43:49,019
Why don't you force it out of her?

462
00:43:49,159 --> 00:43:50,251
Force?

463
00:43:50,394 --> 00:43:54,194
You know how powerful that Iron F an is?

464
00:43:56,433 --> 00:43:59,334
Of course I do!

465
00:43:59,837 --> 00:44:00,826
Idiot!

466
00:44:00,971 --> 00:44:02,495
I've made up my mind...

467
00:44:02,640 --> 00:44:05,837
We should work through Ox too

468
00:44:09,780 --> 00:44:11,714
When I lay my hands on the Iron Fan...

469
00:44:11,849 --> 00:44:14,909
...I'll control everything,
just wait and see!

470
00:44:15,052 --> 00:44:16,349
I won't need to waste money...

471
00:44:16,487 --> 00:44:18,751
...buying potions for Dragon

472
00:44:23,527 --> 00:44:25,586
I can't wait for that day!

473
00:44:25,729 --> 00:44:28,562
Of course,
I won't forget your contribution

474
00:44:28,699 --> 00:44:30,724
You're taking care of Ox?
Don't worry

475
00:44:30,868 --> 00:44:33,336
He's dumb through and through

476
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:36,539
And I have more good news for you

477
00:44:36,674 --> 00:44:37,538
Really? What's that?

478
00:44:37,675 --> 00:44:39,802
Tripitaka,
the holy monk from the East, is here

479
00:44:39,943 --> 00:44:42,912
Why should I care about that?

480
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:45,811
You don't understand,
he's a very holy monk

481
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:47,541
It's said that if you grind up
his bones and swallow them...

482
00:44:47,685 --> 00:44:48,583
...you'll live forever

483
00:44:50,354 --> 00:44:52,117
Live forever?

484
00:45:58,088 --> 00:46:00,818
Mr Ox, you're a bit late today

485
00:46:00,958 --> 00:46:02,550
Nonsense!

486
00:46:02,693 --> 00:46:05,389
I'm always the first to arrive
in Half Mountain Inn

487
00:46:06,029 --> 00:46:09,021
Listen, I'm here today
to win back everything I lost

488
00:46:09,166 --> 00:46:11,031
I'm with my old pal Monkey

489
00:46:11,568 --> 00:46:13,627
Lady luck is with me today

490
00:46:13,771 --> 00:46:15,432
Do come in

491
00:46:42,933 --> 00:46:44,730
I have to slip out for a while

492
00:47:40,757 --> 00:47:42,019
What's going on?

493
00:47:50,067 --> 00:47:51,830
What's gotten into you?

494
00:47:55,539 --> 00:47:57,598
Stop whirling me around!

495
00:47:59,209 --> 00:48:02,406
What's going on?
You're making me dizzy!

496
00:48:02,546 --> 00:48:04,878
Really?

497
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,414
I have good news for you

498
00:48:08,986 --> 00:48:11,477
I know where our son is

499
00:48:12,489 --> 00:48:14,286
You big oaf, I already know!

500
00:48:14,424 --> 00:48:17,154
You do?
Drat, someone's ruined my surprise

501
00:48:23,667 --> 00:48:26,135
First thing tomorrow,
I'll tell Buddha to let him go

502
00:48:27,337 --> 00:48:30,636
What makes you think
Buddha will release him?

503
00:48:31,375 --> 00:48:34,242
I'll force him to if I have to

504
00:48:34,745 --> 00:48:35,677
Force him?

505
00:48:35,812 --> 00:48:38,906
Surely even you aren't stupid enough
to pick a fight with Buddha?

506
00:48:45,455 --> 00:48:47,355
I can't beat Buddha,
but I can offer to swap places with Red

507
00:48:47,491 --> 00:48:49,118
Buddha can lock me up instead!

508
00:48:49,259 --> 00:48:51,193
That way, I won't be able to go gambling

509
00:48:51,328 --> 00:48:53,353
So it will kill two birds with one stone

510
00:48:53,497 --> 00:48:56,557
And you won't give me a hard time
when I come home

511
00:48:57,167 --> 00:48:58,896
Are you serious?

512
00:48:59,369 --> 00:49:01,496
You really mean it?

513
00:49:01,638 --> 00:49:02,502
Every word!

514
00:49:02,639 --> 00:49:05,904
I'll do anything for you and Red

515
00:49:12,349 --> 00:49:14,476
Wula, what are you doing?

516
00:49:14,618 --> 00:49:16,643
You miss Red too?

517
00:49:16,787 --> 00:49:19,847
You're so eager
for me to take his place?

518
00:49:20,791 --> 00:49:22,315
Wula! Bad dog!

519
00:49:28,398 --> 00:49:31,526
You don't seem yourself today

520
00:49:32,769 --> 00:49:34,737
I'm fine

521
00:49:34,871 --> 00:49:36,236
I haven't had a drink all day

522
00:49:36,373 --> 00:49:37,863
But take care while I'm out

523
00:49:38,008 --> 00:49:40,602
That pesky Monkey
might come by and cause trouble again

524
00:49:40,744 --> 00:49:42,609
You're usually the last one
to think about family matters

525
00:49:42,746 --> 00:49:44,373
How did you know that
Monkey has been here?

526
00:49:44,881 --> 00:49:47,748
I know lots of things!
I bumped into him on my way home

527
00:49:47,884 --> 00:49:50,045
He wanted me to
get your Iron F an for him

528
00:49:50,187 --> 00:49:51,984
He wants to steal it

529
00:49:52,122 --> 00:49:54,283
He's using you to trick me?

530
00:49:54,424 --> 00:49:55,322
Don't worry

531
00:49:55,459 --> 00:49:58,792
I know what he's up to!

532
00:49:58,929 --> 00:50:01,420
...but I'm no Dumb Ox

533
00:50:02,399 --> 00:50:03,525
Whatever you say

534
00:50:04,668 --> 00:50:06,226
By the way, honey...

535
00:50:06,370 --> 00:50:08,497
Are you sure the Iron Fan is safe?

536
00:50:09,039 --> 00:50:10,131
Of course I am

537
00:50:10,273 --> 00:50:11,297
Really?

538
00:50:11,441 --> 00:50:12,499
Don't be silly

539
00:50:12,642 --> 00:50:14,542
Can you make sure it is?

540
00:50:14,678 --> 00:50:15,508
Why would I do that?

541
00:50:15,645 --> 00:50:17,203
Just to be certain

542
00:50:17,347 --> 00:50:19,474
Just check that it's where it should be

543
00:50:20,684 --> 00:50:22,777
How thoughtful of you

544
00:50:26,323 --> 00:50:28,257
Don't mention it

545
00:50:28,392 --> 00:50:29,416
It's your heirloom!

546
00:50:29,559 --> 00:50:31,117
We have to be sure

547
00:50:37,134 --> 00:50:38,931
It's always here

548
00:50:39,069 --> 00:50:42,095
Don't worry, I'm not as careless as you!

549
00:50:42,239 --> 00:50:43,934
That's a relief!

550
00:50:44,074 --> 00:50:46,907
I'm glad you're so careful

551
00:50:47,044 --> 00:50:49,205
You're a treasure

552
00:51:09,099 --> 00:51:10,794
Thanks, Sis!

553
00:51:49,673 --> 00:51:53,507
Wow, how did it get to be this size?

554
00:51:54,978 --> 00:51:57,776
And how do I change it back?

555
00:51:57,914 --> 00:51:59,404
I've forgotten the spell

556
00:52:02,486 --> 00:52:03,817
It doesn't work...

557
00:52:21,671 --> 00:52:23,400
Hey, Pork Pie! Roast Pork!

558
00:52:23,540 --> 00:52:25,508
W ake up for a roast pork dinner!

559
00:52:26,610 --> 00:52:27,907
No! Hey, what's up, brother?

560
00:52:28,044 --> 00:52:30,842
Quick, I need your help

561
00:52:30,981 --> 00:52:32,676
Help me carry this Iron F an

562
00:52:34,084 --> 00:52:35,949
Looks pretty heavy!

563
00:52:36,086 --> 00:52:39,055
Get in gear, you lazy pig!

564
00:52:39,189 --> 00:52:40,884
I need more sleep...

565
00:52:41,024 --> 00:52:42,514
If you don't help me,
I'll show you who's the boss around here

566
00:52:43,426 --> 00:52:45,792
Okay, okay, I'll carry it!

567
00:52:47,898 --> 00:52:49,456
You're kind of amazing,
aren't you?

568
00:52:49,599 --> 00:52:51,089
You bet I am!

569
00:52:51,234 --> 00:52:53,634
I twisted the Princess
around my little finger!

570
00:52:56,339 --> 00:52:57,431
Right!

571
00:52:57,574 --> 00:52:59,872
But watch out, that kid Red might
come looking for revenge

572
00:53:00,010 --> 00:53:01,910
Red? That little squirt?

573
00:53:03,980 --> 00:53:06,744
That little squirt
might get the better of you!

574
00:53:06,883 --> 00:53:08,578
You must be kidding!

575
00:53:08,718 --> 00:53:10,208
No, I'm serious!

576
00:53:12,589 --> 00:53:13,715
Shrink!

577
00:53:17,594 --> 00:53:20,495
I don't get it,
why did Buddha let you go?

578
00:53:23,667 --> 00:53:25,225
Justice is always on the side
of the good guys!

579
00:53:25,368 --> 00:53:27,097
I'm having a summer break!

580
00:53:27,237 --> 00:53:30,001
This can't be! How do you control
the Iron F an's size like that?

581
00:53:30,140 --> 00:53:31,664
You're not smart enough to understand

582
00:53:31,808 --> 00:53:33,298
And to catch up with me...

583
00:53:33,443 --> 00:53:35,138
...you need to be really smart

584
00:53:35,545 --> 00:53:37,069
Don't run away!

585
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:42,811
I've beaten you twice,
so you should call me Mast!

586
00:53:44,854 --> 00:53:45,843
But you don't play fair!

587
00:53:45,956 --> 00:53:46,854
The first time,
you had a dragon helping you!

588
00:53:46,990 --> 00:53:48,389
You have no shame!

589
00:53:48,525 --> 00:53:50,220
You can surrender now if you like

590
00:53:50,360 --> 00:53:51,224
That's not gonna happen!

591
00:53:51,361 --> 00:53:52,953
How about we go one on one?
No tricks, no games, just you and me?

592
00:53:53,096 --> 00:53:56,156
It's a deal!
Let's meet three days from now!

593
00:53:59,669 --> 00:54:01,694
Deal!

594
00:54:07,744 --> 00:54:09,302
I was too careless!

595
00:54:09,846 --> 00:54:12,314
How could I lose the Iron Fan like that?

596
00:54:21,224 --> 00:54:22,156
Wula, you're right!

597
00:54:22,292 --> 00:54:25,159
Maybe I should just ask Ox
to come back and sort out the problem

598
00:54:28,298 --> 00:54:29,993
Hold on, Wula...

599
00:54:30,133 --> 00:54:32,727
What if I'm cheated by another fake Ox?

600
00:54:41,244 --> 00:54:42,336
Wula, you're so smart!

601
00:54:42,479 --> 00:54:43,844
He'll be drunk and dirty!

602
00:54:43,980 --> 00:54:46,312
The real Ox is unmistakeable!

603
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,181
But what if he can't defeat Monkey?

604
00:54:53,123 --> 00:54:54,750
I've lost my little Red...

605
00:54:54,891 --> 00:54:56,859
I can't lose my Ox too!

606
00:54:56,993 --> 00:54:58,984
Mama, I'm back!

607
00:54:59,129 --> 00:55:00,061
Red!

608
00:55:00,196 --> 00:55:01,754
How come you're free?

609
00:55:03,066 --> 00:55:05,500
Come, let me hug you!
I've missed you so much

610
00:55:05,969 --> 00:55:07,436
Buddha let me have a break

611
00:55:09,372 --> 00:55:10,999
Buddha is so kind

612
00:55:11,875 --> 00:55:13,137
Red, you're so sweet and clever!

613
00:55:13,276 --> 00:55:15,437
Not like me!
I've just lost my Iron Fan!

614
00:55:15,879 --> 00:55:17,346
Don't worry, Mama

615
00:55:17,480 --> 00:55:19,448
I have a present for you

616
00:55:20,350 --> 00:55:21,783
Look, Mama!

617
00:55:23,620 --> 00:55:26,817
My Iron Fan!
How did you...?

618
00:55:28,525 --> 00:55:31,494
Monkey isn't the only one
with tricks up his sleeve!

619
00:55:50,880 --> 00:55:51,847
Ow, that hurts!

620
00:55:51,981 --> 00:55:53,642
You lazy hog! Roast pork!

621
00:55:53,783 --> 00:55:55,478
Wake up!

622
00:55:55,618 --> 00:55:57,245
Master, look at Brother Monkey!

623
00:55:57,387 --> 00:55:59,355
He's picking on me

624
00:55:59,489 --> 00:56:00,251
Don't you get it?

625
00:56:00,390 --> 00:56:03,587
Before a long journey, you need rest!

626
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:05,393
You're just lazy!

627
00:56:05,528 --> 00:56:06,358
That's a bad excuse!

628
00:56:06,496 --> 00:56:07,087
No...

629
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:08,356
Stop hitting me!

630
00:56:08,498 --> 00:56:09,931
Don't run away!
Stop hitting me!

631
00:56:10,066 --> 00:56:10,532
Shut up!

632
00:56:10,667 --> 00:56:11,827
But my face is my fortune!

633
00:56:11,968 --> 00:56:13,731
Shut up!
Stop hitting me!

634
00:56:13,870 --> 00:56:16,100
Monkey, don't bully Pigsy

635
00:56:17,507 --> 00:56:18,531
What?

636
00:56:18,675 --> 00:56:20,302
I risk my life getting hold
of that stupid Iron F an...

637
00:56:20,443 --> 00:56:22,468
...while he just dozes in the sun!

638
00:56:22,612 --> 00:56:24,477
Why are you siding with him, Master?

639
00:56:24,948 --> 00:56:26,176
I don't want trouble

640
00:56:26,316 --> 00:56:28,079
I just need a helping hand
once in a while

641
00:56:28,218 --> 00:56:29,913
If we don't find a way
to cross these mountains...

642
00:56:30,053 --> 00:56:31,418
...our journey's over

643
00:56:32,222 --> 00:56:34,417
Don't go around blaming people!
Master has done nothing wrong

644
00:56:34,557 --> 00:56:36,752
If not for him, where would we be?

645
00:56:36,893 --> 00:56:39,691
Don't just fly off the handle!
If you have to blame someone, blame me!

646
00:56:39,829 --> 00:56:42,093
Don't blame Master!

647
00:56:42,232 --> 00:56:43,028
One more squeal from you...

648
00:56:43,166 --> 00:56:45,396
...and we'll see who wants roast pork
for dinner

649
00:56:45,835 --> 00:56:47,598
Master! He wants to roast me!

650
00:56:47,737 --> 00:56:51,468
Namo Amitabha...

651
00:56:51,608 --> 00:56:55,237
Ow!!! Master, I can't take it!!!

652
00:56:55,378 --> 00:56:58,438
(out)

653
00:56:58,581 --> 00:56:59,445
(out)

654
00:56:59,582 --> 00:57:02,050
You had this coming!
Serves you right for being so mean!

655
00:57:02,185 --> 00:57:03,812
Master!

656
00:57:04,554 --> 00:57:09,514
You shut up! Better watch what you say!

657
00:57:09,659 --> 00:57:10,819
Don't expect me to come running...

658
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,791
...next time you're in a fix!

659
00:57:13,830 --> 00:57:15,855
Who asked you to?

660
00:57:17,867 --> 00:57:20,631
It's killing me, Master!
I'll be good, I promise!

661
00:57:20,770 --> 00:57:24,365
Master, please end the spell

662
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:26,407
Holy men should be kind and merciful!

663
00:57:26,543 --> 00:57:27,874
That's what you always tell us!

664
00:57:29,279 --> 00:57:34,342
I'll stop as long as
you promise to keep your temper

665
00:57:34,818 --> 00:57:36,581
I promise!
I'll never lose my temper again!

666
00:57:37,020 --> 00:57:38,510
I'm truly sorry, Master

667
00:57:39,522 --> 00:57:41,456
Good!
You must correct your behaviour

668
00:57:41,591 --> 00:57:46,995
Remember, your heart should always
overflow with kindness

669
00:57:57,273 --> 00:57:58,740
Brother...

670
00:57:59,309 --> 00:58:02,540
My heart will overflow with kindness,
but I need my stomach full too

671
00:58:04,647 --> 00:58:07,275
Pigsy, Monkey had a point

672
00:58:07,417 --> 00:58:09,408
You should make yourself useful

673
00:58:10,186 --> 00:58:11,813
How far can you go
on an empty stomach?

674
00:58:11,955 --> 00:58:15,823
And you need rest
to prepare for a long journey

675
00:58:16,392 --> 00:58:18,690
Banana oil!

676
00:58:31,674 --> 00:58:33,164
Master...

677
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:38,605
I know what's on your mind

678
00:58:38,748 --> 00:58:40,613
And I know
what you've done for all of us

679
00:58:40,750 --> 00:58:42,274
We're lucky to have you with us

680
00:58:42,752 --> 00:58:45,983
I have a bad temper,
I let you down

681
00:58:46,122 --> 00:58:47,783
Just remember, try to be patient

682
00:58:47,924 --> 00:58:49,255
Master, I will

683
00:58:56,533 --> 00:58:58,125
Are you laughing at me, too?

684
00:58:58,268 --> 00:59:01,396
You think I'm just a bag of pork chops?

685
00:59:01,538 --> 00:59:03,665
That I can't make any plans?

686
00:59:06,109 --> 00:59:08,270
What are you staring at?

687
00:59:08,411 --> 00:59:10,504
Come closer if you like!

688
00:59:10,647 --> 00:59:12,740
Roast Pork has his pride too

689
00:59:12,882 --> 00:59:15,680
If you don't shup up,
I'll get you...

690
00:59:15,818 --> 00:59:18,719
...and grill you for dinner!

691
00:59:18,855 --> 00:59:20,482
Just look at you!

692
00:59:20,623 --> 00:59:23,091
Not exactly a model citizen, are you?

693
00:59:32,769 --> 00:59:34,737
Coward, you should be afraid of me

694
00:59:37,173 --> 00:59:38,572
You're lucky I missed!

695
00:59:38,708 --> 00:59:40,767
But I've got
more important things to think about

696
00:59:40,910 --> 00:59:42,810
I'll deal with you when I get back

697
00:59:42,946 --> 00:59:47,246
Y eah! Go!

698
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:58,758
What bad luck!

699
01:00:01,731 --> 01:00:04,825
That was just the warm-up

700
01:00:05,268 --> 01:00:06,997
Now for the real show!

701
01:00:08,271 --> 01:00:09,602
No?

702
01:00:10,340 --> 01:00:11,466
You don't believe me?

703
01:00:12,842 --> 01:00:15,811
I'll let you see

704
01:00:16,379 --> 01:00:20,873
This is my super armored cricket!

705
01:00:21,618 --> 01:00:23,483
He's in a class of his own!

706
01:00:23,620 --> 01:00:27,716
He's literally unbeatable!

707
01:00:27,857 --> 01:00:30,451
Ox, I think you should just give up

708
01:00:31,094 --> 01:00:33,790
Just you wait,
I'm going to turn the tables

709
01:00:33,930 --> 01:00:36,296
I've lost almost everything I own!

710
01:00:36,733 --> 01:00:39,634
Sorry to hear that...
I'll make you an offer

711
01:00:40,370 --> 01:00:41,928
Don't ever say
I didn't give you a chance

712
01:00:42,071 --> 01:00:43,402
If you win this game...

713
01:00:43,539 --> 01:00:47,339
...you can recoup all of your losses.

714
01:00:48,544 --> 01:00:51,707
Fine! Just watch me go!

715
01:00:52,115 --> 01:00:53,548
Watch you go? Okay!

716
01:00:54,584 --> 01:00:56,643
But if you lose again...

717
01:00:56,786 --> 01:00:58,344
...what will I get?

718
01:00:58,821 --> 01:00:59,651
My trusty steed!

719
01:00:59,789 --> 01:01:02,519
My Blue-water-golden-eye will be yours!

720
01:01:03,026 --> 01:01:06,928
I don't think so,
I don't have a driving license

721
01:01:07,063 --> 01:01:08,360
So I think you'd better stake
something else instead

722
01:01:08,498 --> 01:01:11,433
Let's see, how about
betting your wife's Iron Fan?

723
01:01:11,868 --> 01:01:13,392
Everyone wants the Iron Fan
all of a sudden!

724
01:01:13,936 --> 01:01:16,336
Sorry, it's her family heirloom

725
01:01:16,472 --> 01:01:17,996
I can't stake that

726
01:01:18,141 --> 01:01:21,304
No deal, no game!

727
01:01:21,911 --> 01:01:24,277
All right, all right, it's a deal

728
01:01:24,414 --> 01:01:25,847
I'll stake the Iron Fan

729
01:01:38,161 --> 01:01:40,823
Little champ,
I've staked everything on you!

730
01:01:40,963 --> 01:01:43,431
My life depends on you!

731
01:01:57,980 --> 01:02:00,073
Seconds out... fight!

732
01:02:13,029 --> 01:02:16,226
Y eah! You've got him!

733
01:02:20,236 --> 01:02:23,865
Go for it! Go!

734
01:02:27,643 --> 01:02:29,873
Half-time!

735
01:02:32,682 --> 01:02:35,082
Come on, buddy! You gotta win for me!

736
01:02:40,289 --> 01:02:44,282
Hey, that's cheating!
You're doping him! Cheat!

737
01:02:44,427 --> 01:02:46,657
Cheat! Cheat!

738
01:02:56,539 --> 01:02:59,474
Okay, now I'm angry!

739
01:03:11,821 --> 01:03:15,450
A bull in a china shop
has nothing on me right now!

740
01:03:20,263 --> 01:03:21,423
Don't run away...

741
01:03:21,564 --> 01:03:23,498
...or I'll knock the whole place down

742
01:03:24,033 --> 01:03:25,523
Don't get so excited!

743
01:03:26,135 --> 01:03:30,401
Here, let your champ have some too!

744
01:03:34,210 --> 01:03:34,801
Oh no!

745
01:03:34,944 --> 01:03:38,107
My poor little buddy!

746
01:03:39,015 --> 01:03:40,482
I should smash you like a bug!

747
01:03:40,616 --> 01:03:42,208
Not so fast! I've arranged
for your precious Princess...

748
01:03:42,351 --> 01:03:43,943
...to take this potion too

749
01:03:44,520 --> 01:03:46,112
You'd better act fast!

750
01:03:46,255 --> 01:03:47,620
Bring me the Iron F an
within four hours...

751
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:49,418
...and I'll give you the antidote

752
01:03:50,126 --> 01:03:53,254
Otherwise you can
bury the Iron Fan with your wife!

753
01:03:58,568 --> 01:04:01,332
That slimy, double-crossing toad!

754
01:04:01,470 --> 01:04:05,964
Double-crossing? Don't insult me!

755
01:04:13,049 --> 01:04:14,983
Hey, watch who you push aside!

756
01:04:15,117 --> 01:04:16,812
You should say "Sorry"
when you bump into someone

757
01:04:16,953 --> 01:04:17,920
I could die laughing!

758
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:20,079
A fat pig complaining to a big ox!

759
01:04:20,223 --> 01:04:21,121
How do you do?

760
01:04:21,257 --> 01:04:24,624
I am the famous Pigsy

761
01:04:25,294 --> 01:04:26,386
Hey, fat pig...

762
01:04:26,529 --> 01:04:29,930
This is a clip joint!
You should steer clear of it!

763
01:04:30,066 --> 01:04:31,533
Don't worry, Ox

764
01:04:31,667 --> 01:04:33,601
I know you always lose

765
01:04:33,736 --> 01:04:36,762
I'm here to win for you

766
01:04:36,906 --> 01:04:38,168
To win for me?

767
01:04:38,975 --> 01:04:41,569
That's odd, how does he know my name?

768
01:04:42,511 --> 01:04:44,536
Anyhow, I must hurry home

769
01:04:54,757 --> 01:04:56,384
Welcome, Pigsy!

770
01:04:56,525 --> 01:04:58,686
Have a seat, good sir!

771
01:04:58,828 --> 01:05:00,989
Plenty of pretty girls here!

772
01:05:01,130 --> 01:05:02,825
I'd like to see your manager

773
01:05:05,468 --> 01:05:06,833
Now the Iron F an
is all but in our hands!

774
01:05:06,969 --> 01:05:09,836
Why has this pig shown up?

775
01:05:09,972 --> 01:05:12,873
Never mind,
he's signing his own death warrant

776
01:05:13,009 --> 01:05:14,772
Through him
we'll get the monk's ground bones!

777
01:05:14,911 --> 01:05:16,674
We'll live forever!

778
01:05:18,014 --> 01:05:21,541
But what about
that interfering little ape?

779
01:05:21,684 --> 01:05:23,811
Monkey?

780
01:05:24,654 --> 01:05:27,282
I have a plan to deal with him

781
01:05:35,932 --> 01:05:39,299
Delicious dishes,
and the rice is good too...

782
01:05:39,435 --> 01:05:41,494
Do you have a vegetarian menu?

783
01:05:41,637 --> 01:05:43,036
Y es, we do

784
01:05:43,539 --> 01:05:46,337
Then next time I'll bring my Master

785
01:05:49,779 --> 01:05:52,043
Ow, something hit me!

786
01:05:52,181 --> 01:05:56,481
Who turned out the lights?
It's suddenly gone dark...

787
01:06:12,635 --> 01:06:16,537
Money, focus your mind!
Calm mind, calm body!

788
01:06:20,843 --> 01:06:23,869
Master, bad news!

789
01:06:24,447 --> 01:06:26,711
Shh! "Calm mind, calm body"

790
01:06:28,718 --> 01:06:31,551
Don't you get it?
What's the problem?

791
01:06:31,687 --> 01:06:33,154
Pigsy's gone missing!

792
01:06:33,289 --> 01:06:34,620
Really?

793
01:06:35,091 --> 01:06:37,218
Roast Pork can't have gone too far!
Let's split up and search for him

794
01:06:37,360 --> 01:06:38,520
Okay

795
01:06:38,995 --> 01:06:42,453
Pigsy! Pigsy!

796
01:06:43,766 --> 01:06:48,430
Watermelon! Watermelon!
Sweet, juicy watermelon!

797
01:06:48,571 --> 01:06:53,008
Come on, have a slice!

798
01:06:53,676 --> 01:06:55,906
I'm sorry, I'm sorry...
Come on!

799
01:06:56,045 --> 01:07:01,210
Try a slice! Help yourself!

800
01:07:02,752 --> 01:07:04,117
But I don't have any money

801
01:07:04,253 --> 01:07:07,120
Never mind, have one on me

802
01:07:09,392 --> 01:07:13,158
Thank you! Don't mind if I do

803
01:07:13,596 --> 01:07:16,360
T ake your time, enjoy!

804
01:07:16,499 --> 01:07:19,491
There's plenty more

805
01:07:19,635 --> 01:07:20,602
Have you...

806
01:07:20,736 --> 01:07:22,294
...by any chance...
seen a fat...

807
01:07:22,438 --> 01:07:23,769
...with a podgy nose...

808
01:07:23,906 --> 01:07:25,897
A pig? Carrying a rake, right?

809
01:07:26,042 --> 01:07:28,306
That's the one?

810
01:07:28,444 --> 01:07:32,380
Y eah, he had some watermelon
and went that way!

811
01:07:37,887 --> 01:07:39,616
Sandy, stop!
I know this creep!

812
01:07:39,755 --> 01:07:40,915
He's up to no good!

813
01:07:41,057 --> 01:07:43,048
That watermelon must be poisoned!

814
01:07:43,592 --> 01:07:45,253
Now, tell me the truth!
Where did that juicy porker...

815
01:07:45,394 --> 01:07:48,124
...I mean, Pigsy...
Where did he go?

816
01:07:48,264 --> 01:07:51,427
Murder! Murder!

817
01:07:51,567 --> 01:07:53,831
Help!
Stop it!

818
01:07:55,137 --> 01:07:57,230
Monkey, stop it!

819
01:07:57,373 --> 01:08:00,536
They didn't pay for the watermelon,
and now they're attacking me!

820
01:08:00,676 --> 01:08:01,904
Master, that toad is lying!

821
01:08:02,044 --> 01:08:03,409
I didn't touch him!

822
01:08:03,546 --> 01:08:05,912
Silence!
I saw the whole thing

823
01:08:06,882 --> 01:08:09,112
Good sir...

824
01:08:09,819 --> 01:08:11,616
Good sir, are you hurt?

825
01:08:11,754 --> 01:08:13,779
I'm so sorry

826
01:08:13,923 --> 01:08:16,289
This is all my fault,
I haven't taught them well enough

827
01:08:16,425 --> 01:08:18,518
Master, Monkey didn't hit him

828
01:08:18,661 --> 01:08:19,889
You're getting it wrong

829
01:08:20,029 --> 01:08:20,893
Be quiet!

830
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,622
I didn't do anything!

831
01:08:23,432 --> 01:08:26,629
I didn't! I'm innocent!

832
01:08:26,769 --> 01:08:29,203
You're incorrigible!

833
01:08:32,641 --> 01:08:34,336
Apologise at once!

834
01:08:34,477 --> 01:08:37,537
I'm innocent...

835
01:08:37,680 --> 01:08:40,171
Go away, you disobedient delinquent!

836
01:08:40,983 --> 01:08:42,041
Hurry up and go!

837
01:08:42,184 --> 01:08:44,084
Don't worry, I won't use the spell

838
01:08:44,220 --> 01:08:46,814
Just go as far away as possible!
I don't want you to be with me

839
01:08:48,557 --> 01:08:51,151
Monkey, apologize to Master!

840
01:08:51,293 --> 01:08:52,282
Please do it!

841
01:08:52,428 --> 01:08:54,362
No way! I've wanted to quit for ages!

842
01:08:54,497 --> 01:08:55,930
Have it your own way, monk!

843
01:08:56,065 --> 01:08:57,089
Go on your quest without me

844
01:08:57,233 --> 01:08:59,827
I'll go back to my mountain

845
01:09:00,369 --> 01:09:02,496
Let him go

846
01:09:02,638 --> 01:09:03,798
Just ignore himself

847
01:09:07,576 --> 01:09:09,168
Monkey...

848
01:09:15,885 --> 01:09:18,945
Please don't be angry, sir!
It was really all my fault

849
01:09:19,088 --> 01:09:21,215
I know where your pig friend went

850
01:09:21,357 --> 01:09:24,155
Just head down this path...

851
01:09:24,293 --> 01:09:26,955
Turn at the next corner,
and you'll find him there

852
01:09:27,096 --> 01:09:30,623
You go ahead,
I'll just clean up this mess here

853
01:09:30,766 --> 01:09:32,131
I'll catch up with you

854
01:09:32,668 --> 01:09:35,193
That's very kind of you!
Many thanks!

855
01:09:46,682 --> 01:09:49,412
Master! Save me!

856
01:09:57,793 --> 01:10:00,387
You wicked spiders!
Release Brother Pigsy right now!

857
01:10:00,529 --> 01:10:03,692
Master! Save me!

858
01:10:03,832 --> 01:10:06,426
You've arrived just in time

859
01:10:06,569 --> 01:10:08,537
All divisions, advance! Seize them!

860
01:10:15,945 --> 01:10:17,037
Princess! Where are you?

861
01:10:17,179 --> 01:10:19,739
Princess! Where are you?

862
01:10:20,316 --> 01:10:23,513
Princess! Where are you?

863
01:10:26,555 --> 01:10:29,149
Wula! Princess!
What's happened to you?

864
01:10:32,761 --> 01:10:35,730
Buck up, Princess!

865
01:10:38,968 --> 01:10:40,401
We're running out of time!

866
01:10:40,536 --> 01:10:43,130
The Fan! Princess, I need the Iron Fan!

867
01:10:43,272 --> 01:10:45,604
Otherwise you'll die
when the sand runs out!

868
01:10:45,741 --> 01:10:48,471
Come on, Baby, we have no time to waste

869
01:10:48,611 --> 01:10:50,203
The Iron Fan... is right...

870
01:10:52,047 --> 01:10:53,571
Come on, Honey, don't nod out!

871
01:10:53,716 --> 01:10:55,047
Honey, wake up!

872
01:10:55,184 --> 01:10:56,947
Where's the Iron Fan?

873
01:10:57,886 --> 01:10:58,978
Where? On her head?

874
01:10:59,121 --> 01:11:00,679
Could it be her hairpin?

875
01:11:02,124 --> 01:11:03,955
So that's where she hides it!

876
01:11:04,093 --> 01:11:05,253
Wula, watch your mistresscarefully

877
01:11:05,394 --> 01:11:07,419
I've got to get the antidote

878
01:11:09,898 --> 01:11:12,332
Hang on, what about the magic spell?

879
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,099
W ake up, Princess!

880
01:11:19,875 --> 01:11:21,502
What shall I do?

881
01:11:22,578 --> 01:11:24,876
Great, Wula! You've been a big help!

882
01:11:25,014 --> 01:11:26,072
Thanks a lot!

883
01:11:26,215 --> 01:11:28,740
I gotta hurry to get the antidote

884
01:11:44,967 --> 01:11:45,626
Who is it?

885
01:11:45,768 --> 01:11:46,496
Who?

886
01:11:46,635 --> 01:11:48,000
Me, of course

887
01:11:49,471 --> 01:11:50,733
Uh... it's you

888
01:11:50,873 --> 01:11:53,273
Monkeyboy,
what's that "Uh"supposed to mean?

889
01:11:56,845 --> 01:11:59,279
I'm in no mood to play with you, kid

890
01:11:59,415 --> 01:12:00,712
What?

891
01:12:00,849 --> 01:12:03,682
You've forgotten our agreement?

892
01:12:03,819 --> 01:12:05,912
No, but I'm not in the mood now

893
01:12:06,055 --> 01:12:08,580
I'm not part of the quest
for the sacred scroll any more

894
01:12:09,191 --> 01:12:12,126
What? Are you breaking your word?

895
01:12:13,696 --> 01:12:14,822
I won't let you!

896
01:12:15,364 --> 01:12:17,332
It's time to settle our differences
once and for all!

897
01:12:18,233 --> 01:12:19,894
Look, kid, I'm not in the mood!
Don't you get it?

898
01:12:20,035 --> 01:12:21,832
Hold it right there! You don't go
anywhere until we've fought!

899
01:12:21,970 --> 01:12:24,495
Fine! You want a fight,
I'll give you a fight!

900
01:12:33,449 --> 01:12:36,043
This is a big day!

901
01:12:36,185 --> 01:12:38,176
Now everything is in your power,
Mistress!

902
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:41,016
How does it feel to be in control?

903
01:12:41,156 --> 01:12:44,057
You have the Iron F an and the monk

904
01:12:44,193 --> 01:12:49,460
Please don't forget our agreement...
the jewels you promised me

905
01:12:50,666 --> 01:12:53,726
Your help has been invaluable, T oad,
I should thank you

906
01:12:53,869 --> 01:12:57,498
How could I forget
all you've done for me?

907
01:12:57,639 --> 01:12:58,901
But...

908
01:12:59,041 --> 01:13:01,908
How do I know that
this is the real Iron Fan?

909
01:13:02,678 --> 01:13:04,737
What are you doing, Mistress?

910
01:13:04,880 --> 01:13:07,041
Hey... Be careful with it!

911
01:13:07,182 --> 01:13:08,706
I just want to test...

912
01:13:08,851 --> 01:13:12,787
...the power of the Iron Fan

913
01:13:14,790 --> 01:13:16,189
Mistress! Please! Spare me!

914
01:13:16,325 --> 01:13:21,228
Hocus Pocus, Abracadabra...

915
01:13:28,537 --> 01:13:31,233
Help! Help me!

916
01:13:31,840 --> 01:13:33,102
A red shoe?

917
01:13:35,911 --> 01:13:39,608
That traitor was wearing those shoes

918
01:13:42,317 --> 01:13:45,411
So it was you!
You're the traitor!

919
01:13:45,554 --> 01:13:48,580
Don't kill me, young master!
They've taken your mother's Iron Fan

920
01:13:48,724 --> 01:13:50,817
Your father and the monk are in danger!

921
01:13:50,959 --> 01:13:53,427
Monkeyboy, we have to rescue them!

922
01:13:53,562 --> 01:13:56,429
It could be a trap

923
01:13:56,565 --> 01:13:59,728
Believe me, it's all true!

924
01:13:59,868 --> 01:14:00,630
Trust me this once!

925
01:14:00,769 --> 01:14:05,035
Spider just used the Iron F an
to blow me away!

926
01:14:05,641 --> 01:14:07,165
Okay, I'll trust you this time

927
01:14:07,309 --> 01:14:10,642
But if it turns out you're lying,
we'll eat frog's legs tonight

928
01:14:10,779 --> 01:14:11,837
Now, get lost!

929
01:14:13,682 --> 01:14:15,411
Ow, my back!

930
01:14:15,551 --> 01:14:17,109
Young master!

931
01:14:18,053 --> 01:14:20,783
Your mother has been poisoned,
but I have the antidote here

932
01:14:20,923 --> 01:14:23,050
Come back!

933
01:14:23,192 --> 01:14:25,854
Ow! Why has it turned out like this?

934
01:14:25,994 --> 01:14:28,121
I guess I deserve it

935
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:33,230
Hey, where are we going? Help!
I'm afraid of heights!

936
01:14:42,044 --> 01:14:45,343
Master, I don't want to be roasted!

937
01:14:45,948 --> 01:14:46,437
Dad!

938
01:14:46,582 --> 01:14:47,981
Look out, son!

939
01:14:48,116 --> 01:14:49,413
You think you can strike us alone?

940
01:14:49,551 --> 01:14:51,519
Archers, deploy webs!

941
01:15:05,167 --> 01:15:08,603
Princess, I've brought you the antidote

942
01:15:21,650 --> 01:15:24,312
Son! Rush home and help your mother!

943
01:15:24,786 --> 01:15:27,550
Monkey, help me!

944
01:15:28,991 --> 01:15:32,722
Forget it! You're not getting away!

945
01:15:35,264 --> 01:15:37,027
You stinking spider, let me go!

946
01:15:38,166 --> 01:15:41,135
So you want to die?
You're the one who's gonna die!

947
01:15:42,638 --> 01:15:44,469
Monkey!

948
01:15:44,606 --> 01:15:45,937
Thanks

949
01:15:46,308 --> 01:15:47,741
Master, that was a close thing!

950
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:49,901
Monkey, you came just in time

951
01:15:50,045 --> 01:15:51,307
Curse you!

952
01:16:01,356 --> 01:16:03,017
Red, my son! This is all my fault!

953
01:16:03,158 --> 01:16:04,625
Thank heaven you're safe!

954
01:16:04,760 --> 01:16:06,887
Dad, let's celebrate another time

955
01:16:07,029 --> 01:16:07,654
Oh! The Iron Fan!

956
01:16:07,796 --> 01:16:09,457
My Iron Fan!

957
01:16:14,036 --> 01:16:16,436
I'm so glad to see you, my dear,
dear, dearest buddy!

958
01:16:17,339 --> 01:16:19,773
This is no time to get sentimental!

959
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,502
I'm sorry for doubting you, Monkey

960
01:16:29,885 --> 01:16:31,876
Pigsy, go and help Horse!

961
01:16:35,657 --> 01:16:37,887
She still has the Iron F an!
What shall we do?

962
01:16:38,026 --> 01:16:40,324
You won't know what hits you!

963
01:16:40,462 --> 01:16:41,759
Retreat!

964
01:16:42,197 --> 01:16:44,529
It's a trap! Spread out!

965
01:17:10,692 --> 01:17:12,660
Fire spiders!

966
01:17:12,794 --> 01:17:15,888
If they put out the fires
on Mount Flame, we'll have no home!

967
01:17:16,031 --> 01:17:19,023
T ake up your weapons and prepare
to fight for your lives!

968
01:17:19,167 --> 01:17:22,694
Spider queendom rules the world!

969
01:17:22,838 --> 01:17:26,569
Spider queendom rules the world!

970
01:17:27,809 --> 01:17:31,108
Spider queendom rules the world!

971
01:18:01,576 --> 01:18:03,066
You asked for it!

972
01:18:09,618 --> 01:18:11,586
Master, stay clear!

973
01:18:41,216 --> 01:18:43,741
Okay, clone disciples, fight!

974
01:19:07,109 --> 01:19:09,100
Shrink!

975
01:19:37,739 --> 01:19:39,468
We'll help you!

976
01:19:45,213 --> 01:19:50,048
Dragon! Dragon! Dragon!

977
01:19:53,155 --> 01:19:55,749
Fetch! Bring me the Iron F an!

978
01:20:13,074 --> 01:20:13,870
Ugh!

979
01:20:14,009 --> 01:20:16,170
Next time, watch where you're going!

980
01:20:19,714 --> 01:20:21,443
Why don't you keep your eyes open
and your mouth shut?

981
01:20:21,583 --> 01:20:22,709
Let's go!

982
01:20:26,388 --> 01:20:29,357
Dragon! Don't give her the Iron Fan!

983
01:20:36,398 --> 01:20:38,093
Dragon! Don't give her the Iron Fan!

984
01:20:40,468 --> 01:20:42,333
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

985
01:20:42,938 --> 01:20:45,600
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

986
01:20:46,174 --> 01:20:48,301
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

987
01:20:48,443 --> 01:20:51,105
Give it to me!
Give it to me!

988
01:21:21,877 --> 01:21:22,866
Oh dear!

989
01:21:23,011 --> 01:21:24,000
I'm so sorry!

990
01:21:24,145 --> 01:21:25,476
Did that hurt?

991
01:21:27,349 --> 01:21:28,907
Stop bucking around!

992
01:21:29,050 --> 01:21:31,541
Stop bucking around!

993
01:21:38,793 --> 01:21:39,623
That's it!

994
01:21:39,761 --> 01:21:41,285
Go, go!

995
01:21:43,665 --> 01:21:44,290
Hey, you ugly bug!

996
01:21:44,432 --> 01:21:46,696
If you hurt him,
I'll cut you into pieces!

997
01:21:47,235 --> 01:21:49,795
Don't bite off
more than you can chew, brat!

998
01:22:19,167 --> 01:22:20,498
Come on, hurry!

999
01:22:20,635 --> 01:22:22,830
They sound busy in there!
Maybe we should come back later...

1000
01:22:22,971 --> 01:22:25,735
Darling, wait for me!

1001
01:22:26,408 --> 01:22:28,273
Can I believe my eyes?

1002
01:22:30,545 --> 01:22:32,172
I'm fully recovered!

1003
01:22:39,821 --> 01:22:41,288
It's a miracle

1004
01:22:41,890 --> 01:22:43,118
I've been so blind!

1005
01:22:43,758 --> 01:22:45,123
I'll never gamble again

1006
01:22:45,260 --> 01:22:46,989
This is no time to get sentimental!

1007
01:22:48,029 --> 01:22:49,155
Where's our son?

1008
01:23:08,350 --> 01:23:09,715
There they are, up there!

1009
01:23:22,030 --> 01:23:24,726
Over here! The blanket's ready!

1010
01:23:32,874 --> 01:23:34,774
We have to save my Dragon!
You got it!

1011
01:23:46,021 --> 01:23:47,682
Thank you for my Iron F an

1012
01:24:22,257 --> 01:24:23,451
What's wrong with him?

1013
01:24:23,591 --> 01:24:26,116
He's choking on the pearl!
We have to help him

1014
01:24:40,708 --> 01:24:41,936
The pearl!

1015
01:24:48,783 --> 01:24:50,478
We did it!

1016
01:24:50,618 --> 01:24:53,587
You're the best little dragon
in the world!

1017
01:24:54,189 --> 01:24:56,350
Dragon! My sweet little Dragon!

1018
01:24:58,860 --> 01:25:02,193
You're the best little dragon
in the world!

1019
01:25:15,410 --> 01:25:18,470
What terrible disasters...

1020
01:25:18,613 --> 01:25:21,047
...Mount Flame has caused

1021
01:25:21,616 --> 01:25:23,709
Please take cover, all of you

1022
01:25:23,852 --> 01:25:25,820
I'll do something about it

1023
01:26:35,757 --> 01:26:38,726
The Iron Fan is precious only
when it's used in the right way

1024
01:26:39,194 --> 01:26:41,253
What's wrong, my dearest?
Mama!

1025
01:26:41,663 --> 01:26:42,755
I'll be fine

1026
01:26:42,897 --> 01:26:44,922
I'm just a little tired

1027
01:26:45,066 --> 01:26:46,397
Amitabha! Buddha be praised!

1028
01:26:46,534 --> 01:26:49,196
What you have done for us all...

1029
01:26:49,337 --> 01:26:51,305
...is truly beyond any words of thanks

1030
01:26:51,706 --> 01:26:53,037
Now that the fire is out...

1031
01:26:53,174 --> 01:26:57,042
...we must say farewell and
continue our quest for the sacred scroll

1032
01:26:57,178 --> 01:26:59,169
You have to leave right now?

1033
01:26:59,581 --> 01:27:01,742
Hey, kid! Stay cool!

1034
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,477
I'll see you again
when we've finished the quest

1035
01:27:04,619 --> 01:27:05,643
Ox, my old friend...

1036
01:27:05,787 --> 01:27:07,516
Like father, like son

1037
01:27:07,655 --> 01:27:09,088
You have an amazing boy!

1038
01:27:09,724 --> 01:27:11,521
Till we meet again! Goodbye!

1039
01:27:11,659 --> 01:27:12,990
A gift for you

1040
01:27:15,597 --> 01:27:15,995
Monkey...

1041
01:27:16,130 --> 01:27:17,791
What's wrong now, boss?

1042
01:27:17,932 --> 01:27:18,830
I think...

1043
01:27:18,967 --> 01:27:22,027
I think it's about time
we took off this ring

1044
01:27:22,837 --> 01:27:24,998
Too much!

1045
01:27:26,574 --> 01:27:29,065
Master, are you sure about that?

1046
01:27:29,210 --> 01:27:32,338
What if Monkey tries to
tenderize me again?

1047
01:27:32,480 --> 01:27:34,448
Pigsy, you worry too much

1048
01:27:34,582 --> 01:27:35,606
But Master...

1049
01:27:35,750 --> 01:27:38,116
Last time he hit my head with his staff

1050
01:27:38,253 --> 01:27:39,880
He said my head was like a wooden fish!

1051
01:27:40,021 --> 01:27:40,817
Master, Master...

1052
01:27:40,955 --> 01:27:42,354
I think I'm kind of used to wearing it

1053
01:27:42,490 --> 01:27:43,582
I won't look so cool without it

1054
01:27:43,725 --> 01:27:45,488
An idol like me needs to look cool!

1055
01:27:45,627 --> 01:27:48,255
I can wait for the sequel
to take it off! Thanks anyway!

1056
01:27:49,030 --> 01:27:50,327
Amitabha!

1057
01:27:50,465 --> 01:27:52,490
Amitabha! So be it!

1058
01:27:53,534 --> 01:27:54,796
Hey, Monkeyboy!

1059
01:27:54,936 --> 01:27:55,903
After your quest...

1060
01:27:56,037 --> 01:27:58,471
...don't forget to come visit me!

1061
01:27:59,040 --> 01:28:00,166
Sure, no problem!

1062
01:28:00,308 --> 01:28:02,208
Count on it! Bye bye!

1063
01:28:05,280 --> 01:28:06,542
It's a deal!

1064
01:28:06,981 --> 01:28:08,039
Deal!

1065
01:28:08,182 --> 01:28:09,911
Bye bye! Bye bye!

1066
01:28:10,485 --> 01:28:11,645
Come on, Sandy

1067
01:28:12,220 --> 01:28:13,710
Oh...

1068
01:28:17,458 --> 01:28:18,720
It's a butterfly!

1069
01:28:25,099 --> 01:28:28,068
