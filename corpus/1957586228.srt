Mommy, I saw the neatest
bike in the store today.

As a matter of fact,
it's on sale for $150,

I'm trying to finish
that damn book soon.

75
00:06:00,098 --> 00:06:02,013
I just haven't been
feeling so well.

76
00:06:02,144 --> 00:06:03,972
What did Chekhov say?

You paint my hallucinations
wonderfully well

98
00:07:06,338 --> 00:07:07,992
because that's due in part
to the fact I describe

368
00:19:23,684 --> 00:19:25,686
Presenting mom's famous--

369
00:19:25,816 --> 00:19:27,775
well, not so famous spaghetti.

370
00:19:27,905 --> 00:19:30,604
Here, you go ahead.

371
00:19:30,734 --> 00:19:32,083
I'm not hungry.

372
00:19:32,214 --> 00:19:32,867
Are you sure?

373
00:19:32,997 --> 00:19:33,911
Mm-hmm.

374
00:19:38,046 --> 00:19:40,788
So tomorrow's a new one, huh?

375
00:19:40,918 --> 00:19:43,834
It's school holiday, right?

376
00:19:43,965 --> 00:19:45,401
A picnic, like usual?

377
00:19:45,532 --> 00:19:47,186
Yes.

378
00:19:47,316 --> 00:19:48,839
So did anything new
and unusual and bizarre

379
00:19:48,970 --> 00:19:49,797
happen to you today?

380
00:19:54,628 --> 00:19:56,282
Because I received a
phone call from your dad.

381
00:19:59,894 --> 00:20:02,679
Back again, back again.

382
00:20:02,810 --> 00:20:05,073
He wants to see you.

383
00:20:05,204 --> 00:20:05,987
Do you want to see him?

384
00:20:09,904 --> 00:20:11,427
You can think about it.

385
00:20:11,558 --> 00:20:12,733
Why does he want to see me?

386
00:20:15,997 --> 00:20:21,045
He is your dad, and
he cares about you.

387
00:20:21,176 --> 00:20:23,570
[aaron sighs]

388
00:20:23,700 --> 00:20:25,311
Maybe I do want to see him.

389
00:20:45,809 --> 00:20:50,161
If he doesn't come,
we'll go downtown

390
00:20:50,292 --> 00:20:55,776
or maybe take the subway to
Shirley's or go to Shoppers.

391
00:20:55,906 --> 00:20:58,082
Do you think he forgot?

392
00:20:58,213 --> 00:20:59,780
You're too unforgettable.

393
00:21:28,765 --> 00:21:29,853
You must be Stuart.

394
00:21:29,984 --> 00:21:31,725
Sorry I'm late.

395
00:21:31,855 --> 00:21:32,987
Your ex-wives will
survive you, Stuart,

396
00:21:33,117 --> 00:21:35,076
but God help your progeny.

397
00:21:35,206 --> 00:21:38,122
Hi, Aaron.

398
00:21:38,253 --> 00:21:38,993
How are you?

399
00:21:39,123 --> 00:21:39,950
Fine.

400
00:21:42,344 --> 00:21:45,782
I want to talk
to you in private.

401
00:21:45,913 --> 00:21:47,654
Why can't Aaron hear?

402
00:21:47,784 --> 00:21:48,785
It's between us.

403
00:21:53,312 --> 00:21:54,138
Come on, Aaron.

404
00:21:54,269 --> 00:21:56,097
Get in the car.

405
00:21:56,227 --> 00:21:58,186
Well-- why?

406
00:21:58,317 --> 00:21:59,535
Aaron and I have no secrets.

407
00:21:59,666 --> 00:22:02,756
It's that old business.

408
00:22:02,886 --> 00:22:03,626
Oh, all right.

409
00:22:03,757 --> 00:22:04,845
Go ahead.

410
00:22:04,975 --> 00:22:05,715
I'll see you tonight.

411
00:22:10,503 --> 00:22:12,896
That social worker told me
that he was alone in the house

412
00:22:13,027 --> 00:22:15,029
while you were in the hospital.

413
00:22:15,159 --> 00:22:16,813
One night, Aaron can take
care of himself for one night.

414
00:22:16,944 --> 00:22:18,772
You might recall that
in the divorce decree

415
00:22:18,902 --> 00:22:21,165
I get full custody if you
are non compos mentis.

416
00:22:21,296 --> 00:22:22,732
Why so concerned
all of a sudden,

417
00:22:22,863 --> 00:22:24,647
you between bad marriages?

418
00:22:24,778 --> 00:22:26,432
I'm worried about Aaron.

419
00:22:26,562 --> 00:22:28,216
Well, so worried you
beat a path to his door

420
00:22:28,347 --> 00:22:30,000
for eight or nine months?

421
00:22:30,131 --> 00:22:32,089
So why did you go
into the hospital?

422
00:22:32,220 --> 00:22:33,787
I was ill.

423
00:22:33,917 --> 00:22:35,789
I needed to rest.

424
00:22:35,919 --> 00:22:38,313
Yeah, the same old
flipping the lid business.

425
00:22:38,444 --> 00:22:40,446
You haven't changed
a bit, Margaret.

426
00:22:40,576 --> 00:22:42,273
I don't want Aaron here alone
again while you're getting

427
00:22:42,404 --> 00:22:44,798
your head screwed on straight.

428
00:22:44,928 --> 00:22:46,408
In fact, I don't know if I want
a crazy woman raising my son.

429
00:22:46,539 --> 00:22:48,323
You've known I've been
schizophrenic all his life.

430
00:22:48,454 --> 00:22:49,933
It never seemed to
bother you before.

431
00:22:50,064 --> 00:22:52,283
You're wrong.

432
00:22:52,414 --> 00:22:54,242
It's been bothering me
for a long time now.

433
00:22:54,373 --> 00:22:56,810
You never once did anything
to make me not be crazy.

434
00:22:56,940 --> 00:22:58,289
You were just so afraid of me.

435
00:22:58,420 --> 00:23:00,161
I'm not interested
in the past.

436
00:23:00,291 --> 00:23:01,162
I'm not interested in
rehashing the past.

437
00:23:01,292 --> 00:23:02,032
I'm talking about now.

438
00:23:04,774 --> 00:23:05,993
I'm not going let
you make him crazy.

439
00:23:12,913 --> 00:23:13,740
All right.

440
00:23:13,870 --> 00:23:14,741
Here we go.

441
00:23:14,871 --> 00:23:15,829
Are you ready?

442
00:23:15,959 --> 00:23:18,658
Watch this.

443
00:23:18,788 --> 00:23:22,009
I'm staying with
Grandma temporarily.

444
00:23:22,139 --> 00:23:23,793
She hasn't seen you since
you were in diapers.

445
00:23:23,924 --> 00:23:27,841
I never wore diapers.

446
00:23:27,971 --> 00:23:29,973
So what's the third
grader like yourselves'

447
00:23:30,104 --> 00:23:34,064
favorite thing to do these days,
stuff you do with your friends?

448
00:23:34,195 --> 00:23:36,153
OK then, with your mom?

449
00:23:36,284 --> 00:23:41,637
Well, we go to Mr. Obadiah's
and to the movies and--

450
00:23:41,768 --> 00:23:45,206
How about a movie then?

451
00:23:45,336 --> 00:23:47,382
Pretty lousy.

452
00:23:47,513 --> 00:23:49,166
Your mom leaves you
all alone in the house

453
00:23:49,297 --> 00:23:51,604
when she's in the hospital?

454
00:23:51,734 --> 00:23:55,477
And we go to Shoppers Drug
Mart and to Dr. Gates' office.

455
00:23:55,608 --> 00:23:58,349
But that's boring because I
have to sit in the waiting room.

456
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,003
And we go on picnics
and talk to Grover.

457
00:24:00,134 --> 00:24:01,309
Who's Grover?

458
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:02,615
My adopted brother.

AARON GIBSON: Hi, Shirley.

462
00:24:50,532 --> 00:24:52,099
Look what I got.

463
00:24:52,229 --> 00:24:54,318
Hello, my little
hugger mugger.

464
00:24:54,449 --> 00:24:56,146
When are you going to come visit
me in my studio again, huh?

465
00:24:56,277 --> 00:24:58,322
We'll play together.

466
00:24:58,453 --> 00:25:00,847
Okey-dokey, time to see if
Blanche DuBois is up yet.

467
00:25:18,081 --> 00:25:19,866
Climate check.

468
00:25:19,996 --> 00:25:20,823
Hm, chilly.

469
00:25:24,435 --> 00:25:27,221
Up at the crack of
noon and looking as

470
00:25:27,351 --> 00:25:29,832
cheerful as the county morgue.

471
00:25:29,963 --> 00:25:31,834
No sleep?

472
00:25:31,965 --> 00:25:32,661
Voices?

473
00:25:32,792 --> 00:25:33,880
No.

474
00:25:34,010 --> 00:25:36,709
Well, that's good.

475
00:25:36,839 --> 00:25:38,406
What is it, Margaret?

476
00:25:38,537 --> 00:25:42,671
I'm coming, and I'm
going faster and faster.

477
00:25:42,802 --> 00:25:46,240
This is familiar, you
turning my paintings around.

478
00:25:46,370 --> 00:25:49,939
I don't think I
did that, Shirley.

479
00:25:50,070 --> 00:25:51,375
Maybe I just got tired
of looking at them.

480
00:25:51,506 --> 00:25:54,161
Oh, all right.

481
00:25:54,291 --> 00:25:56,424
I can live with that.

482
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:57,425
It's just that when we were
roommates and things got bad,

483
00:25:57,556 --> 00:25:59,340
it started like this.

484
00:26:02,125 --> 00:26:02,909
I'm worried.

485
00:26:09,132 --> 00:26:11,308
God, are you sure this
doctor knows what he's doing?

486
00:26:11,439 --> 00:26:15,312
No, no, no, I'm
a walking pharmacy.

487
00:26:15,443 --> 00:26:17,010
Stuart saw Aaron.

488
00:26:17,140 --> 00:26:20,143
Well, that was
whimsical of him.

489
00:26:20,274 --> 00:26:23,016
I'm afraid he'll try and
take Aaron away from me.

490
00:26:23,146 --> 00:26:25,105
He threatened it, and he did.

491
00:26:25,235 --> 00:26:27,324
And if I lose the house--

492
00:26:27,455 --> 00:26:29,065
No, you can't think about all
these things at the same time.

493
00:26:29,196 --> 00:26:31,067
When you do, you
just flip, Margaret.

494
00:26:31,198 --> 00:26:33,243
You have to think about
trying to finish your book.

495
00:26:33,374 --> 00:26:35,202
I'm so scared.

496
00:26:35,332 --> 00:26:36,203
I can't work.

497
00:26:36,333 --> 00:26:38,074
I can't sleep.

498
00:26:38,205 --> 00:26:39,293
Somehow, in my head,
the sounds of clocks

499
00:26:39,423 --> 00:26:41,251
has to do with the hospital.

500
00:26:41,382 --> 00:26:42,601
So I kept thinking, "Time
breaks, time breaks."

501
00:26:47,344 --> 00:26:48,781
I'll lose him if I
go in the hospital.

502
00:26:48,911 --> 00:26:50,130
I'll lose him.

Margaret?

511
00:28:02,463 --> 00:28:04,247
What happened, Margaret?

512
00:28:04,378 --> 00:28:06,336
Just tell me they
were ripped off.

513
00:28:06,467 --> 00:28:07,990
Tell me the paintings
were stolen,

514
00:28:08,121 --> 00:28:09,296
and they're not
buried somewhere in--

515
00:28:15,606 --> 00:28:21,003
Man, I cannot help but
take this personally.

516
00:28:21,134 --> 00:28:24,833
This is really uncool.

517
00:28:24,964 --> 00:28:25,486
Why?

518
00:28:25,616 --> 00:28:27,270
Why?

519
00:28:27,401 --> 00:28:28,315
Because you exploit me.

520
00:28:28,445 --> 00:28:29,490
That's why.

521
00:28:29,620 --> 00:28:31,535
I'm a freak, aren't I?

522
00:28:31,666 --> 00:28:33,407
Come visit the freak for
some artistic inspiration.

I'm a bottomless pit

You're destroying
yourself, Margaret.

527
00:28:39,630 --> 00:28:40,544
You got to do something.

528
00:28:40,675 --> 00:28:41,937
You've got to try.

529
00:28:42,068 --> 00:28:44,113
Aaron needs you to try.

530
00:28:44,244 --> 00:28:46,115
Please just do something or
I can't watch this anymore.

531
00:28:46,246 --> 00:28:48,509
Then to hell with you.

532
00:28:48,639 --> 00:28:50,032
Do you really mean that?

533
00:28:50,163 --> 00:28:53,035
Go to hell.

The court reevaluates
the case whenever there's

been a significant change.

Yes.

Whether or not Stuart
has been super dad,

740
00:40:59,587 --> 00:41:01,284
the court might find him
the preferable parent

741
00:41:01,415 --> 00:41:04,157
simply because he has
no psychiatric history.

742

going to be able to take care

how Aaron's doing.

And you're in touch
with reality now.

907
00:49:49,943 --> 00:49:52,859
Well, I know I've always
been a little crazy.

908
00:49:52,990 --> 00:49:59,648
But you're right, I've
always felt things strongly.

909
00:49:59,779 --> 00:50:02,303
Wh-- why would they
say that about me?

910
00:50:02,434 --> 00:50:03,739
You mean I've never
been schizophrenic?

911
00:50:03,870 --> 00:50:04,958
Well, I didn't know you then.

912
00:50:05,089 --> 00:50:06,873
I just know you now.

913
00:50:07,004 --> 00:50:08,701
And now you seem to
be engaged with life.

914
00:50:11,921 --> 00:50:17,449
Well, if I'm no
schizo, what am I?

915
00:50:17,579 --> 00:50:18,798
Well, some of
your symptoms are

916
00:50:18,928 --> 00:50:20,582
found in any number of labels.

917
00:50:20,713 --> 00:50:23,063
Changing the labels
won't change you.

918
00:50:23,194 --> 00:50:25,022
There are certain
skills we can teach

919
00:50:25,152 --> 00:50:27,720
you to manage your
life better, but only

920
00:50:27,850 --> 00:50:30,549
you can change your life.

921
00:50:30,679 --> 00:50:33,117

[WHISPERING] Moogie.

[music playing]

924
00:51:31,784 --> 00:51:32,654
--wants to see me?

925
00:51:32,785 --> 00:51:34,003
Who?

926
00:51:34,134 --> 00:51:35,092
She says she's an old friend.

927
00:51:39,835 --> 00:51:42,534
Hi.

928
00:51:42,664 --> 00:51:43,535
Hi.

929
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:51,456
Uh, Aaron called me.

930
00:51:51,586 --> 00:51:53,501
If I had any idea
what was going on,

931
00:51:53,632 --> 00:51:55,416
you know I'd have been here.

932
00:51:55,547 --> 00:51:57,897
I know.

933
00:51:58,027 --> 00:52:03,511
I'm-- I'm sorry I
said what I said.

934
00:52:03,642 --> 00:52:04,599
That wasn't me talking.

935
00:52:04,730 --> 00:52:06,732
It was my madness.

936
00:52:06,862 --> 00:52:09,561
Well, you know,
it's just that um,

937
00:52:09,691 --> 00:52:12,041
you never attacked
me before, and I

938
00:52:12,172 --> 00:52:14,566
didn't know how to handle it.

939
00:52:14,696 --> 00:52:16,394
I didn't want to
say goodbye to you.

940
00:52:16,524 --> 00:52:17,308
I know.

941
00:52:21,834 --> 00:52:23,662
People like us
don't say goodbye.

942
00:52:27,056 --> 00:52:30,016
We just uh--

943
00:52:30,147 --> 00:52:31,887
We just get interrupted.

944
00:52:35,674 --> 00:52:37,458
Aaron told me about the house.

945
00:52:37,589 --> 00:52:40,766
I put your name on the
list for public housing,

946
00:52:40,896 --> 00:52:45,640
but I found a place.

947
00:52:45,771 --> 00:52:47,947
[car engine sounds]

948
00:53:04,268 --> 00:53:06,357
Does it have running water?

949
00:53:06,487 --> 00:53:07,619
I didn't ask.

950
00:53:12,580 --> 00:53:15,322
[baby crying]

951
00:53:17,803 --> 00:53:19,674
Oh, great.

952
00:53:19,805 --> 00:53:20,849
Stuart's going to milk
this for all it's worth.

953
00:53:27,856 --> 00:53:31,686
Oh, this place would be
exhibit A. Your honor,

954
00:53:31,817 --> 00:53:33,471
my only son lives in
a rat-infested dump

955
00:53:33,601 --> 00:53:34,646
because his crazy
mom's on welfare.

956
00:53:34,776 --> 00:53:36,125
Aw.

957
00:53:36,256 --> 00:53:37,431
I know it's the
best you can do.

958
00:53:43,698 --> 00:53:45,047
There's more.

959
00:53:45,178 --> 00:53:47,963
More, yeah.

960
00:53:48,094 --> 00:53:51,228
Look, at least it's inside.

961
00:53:58,974 --> 00:54:00,976
I'll have to sleep
in the living room.

962
00:54:01,107 --> 00:54:03,718
It is a bit of a dump, huh?

963
00:54:03,849 --> 00:54:05,503
Well, a few more
paintings will spruce it up.

964
00:54:05,633 --> 00:54:07,113
Hm.

965
00:54:07,244 --> 00:54:08,462
What are you
going to paint now

966
00:54:08,593 --> 00:54:09,420
that I'm not schizo anymore?

967
00:54:09,550 --> 00:54:10,290
Oh, come here.

968
00:54:13,902 --> 00:54:15,034

969
00:54:15,164 --> 00:54:16,862
Oh, Shirley.

[knocking at the door]

971
00:54:27,568 --> 00:54:30,528
This is cheerful.

972
00:54:30,658 --> 00:54:31,398
Come here.

973
00:54:35,968 --> 00:54:39,188
Oh, I missed you, Moogie.

974
00:54:39,319 --> 00:54:40,581
You're the bee's knees, kiddo.

975
00:54:45,934 --> 00:54:47,588
Y-- you feeling better?

976
00:54:52,158 --> 00:54:52,941
Guess not.

977
00:54:55,770 --> 00:55:01,646
Well, better be off.

978
00:55:01,776 --> 00:55:03,604
See you next weekend, Aaron.

979
00:55:03,735 --> 00:55:05,911
[imitating a gun shot]

980
00:55:06,041 --> 00:55:06,912
Bye.

981
00:55:10,263 --> 00:55:14,615
Hey, no guns.

982
00:55:14,746 --> 00:55:15,442
[laughter]

983
00:55:15,573 --> 00:55:17,096
Oh!

984
00:55:17,226 --> 00:55:18,097
Oh!

985
00:55:18,227 --> 00:55:19,664
[laughter]

986
00:55:19,794 --> 00:55:20,839
I was only there for six weeks.

987
00:55:20,969 --> 00:55:22,014
I wasn't in a locked one.

988
00:55:22,144 --> 00:55:23,668
I realize that, Margaret.

989
00:55:23,798 --> 00:55:25,104
But a mental ward,
the stigma, it's

990
00:55:25,234 --> 00:55:26,018
a factor they're
going to exploit.

991
00:55:26,148 --> 00:55:26,975
Is it the factor?

992
00:55:27,106 --> 00:55:29,326
Primarily, yes.

993
00:55:29,456 --> 00:55:30,805
But Aaron's been absent from
school quite a lot before you

994
00:55:30,936 --> 00:55:32,067
went into the hospital.

995
00:55:32,198 --> 00:55:33,939
Margaret, that's bad for us.

996
00:55:34,069 --> 00:55:34,896
You're going to have
to keep him in school

997
00:55:35,027 --> 00:55:35,767
Hi, may I help you?

998
00:55:35,897 --> 00:55:37,029
Margaret?

999
00:55:37,159 --> 00:55:37,856
No, just a coffee, please.

1000
00:55:37,986 --> 00:55:40,554
OK.

1001
00:55:40,685 --> 00:55:42,295
I was on G-2 to get well.

1002
00:55:42,426 --> 00:55:43,992
It does not mean
I'm an unfit mother.

1003
00:55:44,123 --> 00:55:45,777
I am functioning.

1004
00:55:45,907 --> 00:55:46,908
Decently patched
together, that's true,

1005
00:55:47,039 --> 00:55:49,171
that's true, that's true.

1006
00:55:49,302 --> 00:55:51,173
But the doctors would never
let me out if that wasn't so.

1007
00:55:51,304 --> 00:55:53,219
Margaret, any friends you
have, anyone who can provide us

1008
00:55:53,350 --> 00:55:55,090
letters to the court bolstering
support for you as a fit mother

1009
00:55:55,221 --> 00:55:57,179
we can attach to our affidavit.

1010
00:55:57,310 --> 00:56:00,705
In the meantime, you have
to remain on an even keel.

1011
00:56:00,835 --> 00:56:03,664
The best thing for his side
is to see you act crazy.

1012
00:56:03,795 --> 00:56:06,014
No offense.

1013
00:56:06,145 --> 00:56:07,929
Now Mark Perkins will
be interviewing you,

1014
00:56:08,060 --> 00:56:09,191
Aaron, and your ex-husband.

1015
00:56:09,322 --> 00:56:11,411
Who's Mark Perkins?

1016
00:56:11,542 --> 00:56:13,152
He's appointed through the
Attorney General's Office.

1017
00:56:13,282 --> 00:56:15,241
He's a lawyer who will
be Aaron's advocate.

1018
00:56:15,372 --> 00:56:17,374
Your assessment interview
with him will be crucial.

1019
00:56:17,504 --> 00:56:19,114
He's the one we have to
worry about, Margaret.

1020
00:56:21,987 --> 00:56:23,989
Also, he'll be interviewing
you in your home.

1021
00:56:24,119 --> 00:56:24,816
Oh, my God.

1022
00:56:24,946 --> 00:56:26,861
When?

1023
00:56:26,992 --> 00:56:27,862
I'll let you know about
that and the court date

1024
00:56:27,993 --> 00:56:30,865
as soon as I can.

1025
00:56:30,996 --> 00:56:33,215
What are my chance chances?

1026
00:56:33,346 --> 00:56:34,869
Well, I've had easier cases.

1027
00:56:37,829 --> 00:56:39,744
In the meantime, I'd like
to see you maintaining

1028
00:56:39,874 --> 00:56:41,354
financial stability.

1029
00:56:41,485 --> 00:56:43,356
Write, Margaret, write.

1030
00:56:43,487 --> 00:56:44,792
I-- I don't remember how
much you charge an hour.

1031
00:56:44,923 --> 00:56:45,924
Don't worry.

1032
00:56:46,054 --> 00:56:47,055
No, I will pay you.

1033
00:56:47,186 --> 00:56:49,057
Margaret, listen to me.

1034
00:56:49,188 --> 00:56:51,799
Family court can be slow
to resolve these matters.

1035
00:56:51,930 --> 00:56:52,844
Be patient.

1036
00:56:52,974 --> 00:56:55,063
Be calm.

1037
00:56:55,194 --> 00:56:56,500
Just take care of Aaron, OK?

1038
00:56:59,807 --> 00:57:03,071
Since this is a
special occasion,

1039
00:57:03,202 --> 00:57:08,250
our first home-cooked TV
dinner in our new abode,

1040
00:57:08,381 --> 00:57:10,992
let's make a wish.

1041
00:57:11,123 --> 00:57:13,778
[blows out the candle]

1042
00:57:13,908 --> 00:57:15,519
What'd you wish?

1043
00:57:15,649 --> 00:57:18,826
I wished we could move
back to our old house.

1044
00:57:18,957 --> 00:57:22,917
This is just temporary, Aaron,
until I get back on my feet.

1045
00:57:23,048 --> 00:57:25,616
Grove told me he wished
that he lived in a real house

1046
00:57:25,746 --> 00:57:27,008
like real people.

1047
00:57:27,139 --> 00:57:29,097
He don't think we're real?

1048
00:57:29,228 --> 00:57:30,272
I don't know.

1049
00:57:30,403 --> 00:57:31,273
[imitates a buzzer]

1050
00:57:31,404 --> 00:57:33,275
Wrong answer.

1051
00:57:33,406 --> 00:57:37,410
You know, there are two
kinds of real people.

1052
00:57:37,541 --> 00:57:40,152
There's-- there's the
kind that have a two-car

1053
00:57:40,282 --> 00:57:43,285
garage and two
kids and a lifetime

1054
00:57:43,416 --> 00:57:45,374
membership in the Normal Club.

1055
00:57:45,505 --> 00:57:49,335
And then there's the other
kind, like us, who may not

1056
00:57:49,466 --> 00:57:53,339
look so great from the outside
and we may not have a car,

1057
00:57:53,470 --> 00:57:57,038
like Stuart, and we may not
have eaten at a dinner table

1058
00:57:57,169 --> 00:58:01,347
in I don't know how long,
that doesn't mean that we're

1059
00:58:01,478 --> 00:58:03,828
not special and wonderful.

1060
00:58:03,958 --> 00:58:07,875
You know, we-- we care
about each other, you know.

1061
00:58:08,006 --> 00:58:10,661
And that makes us real.

1062
00:58:10,791 --> 00:58:11,662
You get my drift?

1063
00:58:11,792 --> 00:58:14,534
Yeah.

1064
00:58:14,665 --> 00:58:18,407
Sometimes real people, like
us, can be a little crazy,

1065
00:58:18,538 --> 00:58:19,713
and that's OK.

1066
00:58:19,844 --> 00:58:20,975
A little crazy?

1067
00:58:30,332 --> 00:58:33,422
I saw Duncan Miller today.

1068
00:58:33,553 --> 00:58:35,163
He's our lawyer, remember?

1069
00:58:35,294 --> 00:58:38,906
About my custody suit?

1070
00:58:39,037 --> 00:58:42,736
Do you know what he said?

1071
00:58:42,867 --> 00:58:43,694
He said, I could lose you.

1072
00:58:48,263 --> 00:58:49,177
How do you feel about that?

1073
00:58:52,877 --> 00:58:55,096
You don't want to talk about it.

1074
00:58:55,227 --> 00:58:57,185
You keep to yourself
so much it worries me.

1075
00:58:57,316 --> 00:59:04,715
Mom, I feel like it was
all my fault this happened.

1076
00:59:04,845 --> 00:59:06,368
Why, Aaron?

1077
00:59:06,499 --> 00:59:09,241
If I hadn't phoned
Donald Culver,

1078
00:59:09,371 --> 00:59:13,201
Stuart wouldn't have
started the custody suit.

1079
00:59:13,332 --> 00:59:16,074
I needed help.

1080
00:59:16,204 --> 00:59:19,512
You-- you did the right thing.

1081
00:59:19,643 --> 00:59:21,993
It's not your fault,
you understand?

1082
00:59:24,604 --> 00:59:25,692
Do you understand?

1083

Oh, thank you.

1086
00:59:37,312 --> 00:59:38,879
Yes, I'm feeling better.

1087
00:59:39,010 --> 00:59:41,012
Kenneth, would you--
would you write

1088
00:59:41,142 --> 00:59:43,667
a letter to the court telling
them I'm a decent mother?

1089
00:59:43,797 --> 00:59:45,973

get custody of Aaron, an--

1090
00:59:46,104 --> 00:59:47,801
and they're sending an
official guardian here

1091
00:59:47,932 --> 00:59:49,542
to-- to scrutinize my fitness.

1092
00:59:49,673 --> 00:59:50,630
Would you help, please?

1093
00:59:55,635 --> 00:59:56,897
Thank you.

1094
00:59:57,028 --> 00:59:57,724

How is it for you,
being out of the hospital?

1100

It's like living
in a glass house.

1101
01:00:24,708 --> 01:00:27,101
I can't write anymore.

1102
01:00:27,232 --> 01:00:28,842
Last night, my mind
was an awful companion.

1103
01:00:28,973 --> 01:00:31,497
Give yourself time, Margaret.

1104
01:00:31,628 --> 01:00:33,891
You've got a lot to
contend with right now.

1105
01:00:34,021 --> 01:00:35,196
You're trying.

1106
01:00:35,327 --> 01:00:37,285
Give yourself credit for that.

1107
01:00:37,416 --> 01:00:40,898
I-- I need to get inside
the skin of a word again.

1108
01:00:41,028 --> 01:00:43,422
If I can't write, I'm sunk.

1109
01:00:43,552 --> 01:00:45,642
I'm so worried about my
writing that I can't sleep.

1110
01:00:45,772 --> 01:00:48,209
I-- Isn't there-- there
some sleeping pill tha--

1112
01:00:51,691 --> 01:00:53,171
Oh, I can see by your
psychiatric face,

1113
01:00:53,301 --> 01:00:54,389
that's inappropriate.

1114
01:00:54,520 --> 01:00:56,740
Very.

1115
01:00:56,870 --> 01:00:58,263
Well, every shrink before you
would give me a pile of pills.

1116
01:00:58,393 --> 01:01:00,482
I'm not a prescription clerk.

1117
01:01:00,613 --> 01:01:02,441
So-- so while I'm lying there
thinking that the official

1118
01:01:02,571 --> 01:01:04,269
guardian is going to take
Aaron away from me because I

1119
01:01:04,399 --> 01:01:05,531
am the broken pane
of glass in his

1120
01:01:05,662 --> 01:01:07,707
life and I'm halfway to bedlam.

1121
01:01:07,838 --> 01:01:10,971
What am I supposed to do,
play auditory hallucinations

1122

start complaining?

1123

Don't lie in bed.

1124
01:01:14,148 --> 01:01:15,628
That's just inviting trouble.

1125
01:01:15,759 --> 01:01:17,717
I mean, you'll be
lying there thinking,

how crummy do I feel today?

1127

Get out of bed.

1128
01:01:22,243 --> 01:01:23,288
And do what?

1129
01:01:23,418 --> 01:01:24,506
Something.

1130
01:01:24,637 --> 01:01:25,856
Well-- I--

1131
01:01:25,986 --> 01:01:26,987
I can't write.

1132
01:01:27,118 --> 01:01:28,249
That's all I know.

I don't have any hobbies.

I can't turn my brain off.

Well, try not to think.

1136

Do dishes, vacuum, bake.

1137
01:01:35,126 --> 01:01:37,868
Bake?

1138
01:01:37,998 --> 01:01:40,218
I can't cook.

1139
01:01:40,348 --> 01:01:42,350
I've heard that these are not
unlearnable skills, Margaret.

1140
01:01:46,485 --> 01:01:48,487
You know what occurred to
me in the middle of the night?

1141
01:01:48,617 --> 01:01:49,444
What?

1142
01:01:52,926 --> 01:01:57,191
That if I'm not good
for him, I'd give him up.

1143
01:02:02,109 --> 01:02:03,676
I have these crazy
parts inside me

1144

no matter how quickly
I try to amputate them,

1145
01:02:05,460 --> 01:02:08,986
but I do want what's
good for Aaron.

1146
01:02:09,116 --> 01:02:10,683
Well, it must be
painful to think that,

1147
01:02:10,814 --> 01:02:13,555
but it sounds healthy to me.

1148
01:02:13,686 --> 01:02:15,122
What, me giving him up?

1149
01:02:15,253 --> 01:02:16,689
No.

1150
01:02:16,820 --> 01:02:18,299
The thought
process is healthy.

1151
01:02:18,430 --> 01:02:20,998
Wow, healthy thought.

1152
01:02:21,128 --> 01:02:22,477
Imagine what I might
be capable of if I

1153
01:02:22,608 --> 01:02:23,522
didn't have to take Haldol.

1154
01:02:30,398 --> 01:02:32,226
I need to think to write.

1155
01:02:35,229 --> 01:02:38,972
If I take the pills then I
may be able to keep Aaron,

1156

but my brain turns to sawdust.

1157
01:02:42,846 --> 01:02:46,545
If I don't take the
pills, then I can write.

1158
01:02:46,675 --> 01:02:50,070
But I risk going back on
G-2 and risk losing Aaron.

1159

So what am I supposed to do?

1160

Without the medication,
your symptoms could return.

01:09:09,057 --> 01:09:09,797
MARGARET GIBSON: Right.

1259
01:09:17,892 --> 01:09:19,764
Did you spend it all?

1260
01:09:19,894 --> 01:09:21,331
It was dumb.

1261
01:09:21,461 --> 01:09:22,288
It was dumb, I know.

1262
01:09:22,419 --> 01:09:24,595
Beyond dumb.

1263
01:09:24,725 --> 01:09:26,031
No, Aaron deserves to have
something nice happen to him.

1264
01:09:26,162 --> 01:09:27,728
Children need to have fun.

1265
01:09:27,859 --> 01:09:29,513
Margaret, that's
not the point.

1266
01:09:29,643 --> 01:09:31,776
Don't you see I wanted
to do something really,

1267
01:09:31,906 --> 01:09:33,952
really, really
exciting for Aaron?

1268
01:09:34,082 --> 01:09:35,823
I don't know that I'm going
to have another chance.

1269
01:09:39,697 --> 01:09:40,480
I think I might lose him.

1270
01:09:46,704 --> 01:09:49,924
It was wrong, I know, I know.

1271
01:09:57,105 --> 01:09:59,804
Aaron, I made a mistake.

1272
01:09:59,934 --> 01:10:01,675
From now on, we have to
save every single penny.

1273
01:10:04,765 --> 01:10:05,810
We'll turn your
shirts inside out.

1274
01:10:05,940 --> 01:10:07,681
What for?

1275
01:10:07,812 --> 01:10:10,336
Because tomorrow
is inside out day.

1276
01:10:10,467 --> 01:10:12,991
We can save a lot of
money on laundry that way.

1277
01:10:13,121 --> 01:10:16,429
Um, oh.

1278
01:10:16,560 --> 01:10:18,649
What are you doing, Mom?

1279
01:10:18,779 --> 01:10:21,217
I'm unplugging the alarm
clock to save on electricity.

1280
01:10:21,347 --> 01:10:23,044
Maybe I'll save on some time.

1281
01:10:23,175 --> 01:10:25,438
See if we're resourceful,
we can survive.

1282
01:10:28,876 --> 01:10:31,705
You're giving Stuart
grounds for custody, Margaret.

1283
01:10:31,836 --> 01:10:33,620
Not to mention it's bad
for Aaron's development

1284
01:10:33,751 --> 01:10:34,708
to be kept out of school.

1285
01:10:34,839 --> 01:10:35,622
I know, I know.

1286
01:10:35,753 --> 01:10:36,928
I'm sorry.

1287
01:10:37,058 --> 01:10:39,104
I'm digging my own grave.

1288
01:10:39,235 --> 01:10:41,019
Stuart told me that Aaron's
been absent 16 days already

1289
01:10:41,149 --> 01:10:43,021
this year.

1290
01:10:43,151 --> 01:10:44,892
Aaron, the doctor wants
you to go to school.

1291
01:10:45,023 --> 01:10:47,155
It's important.

1292
01:10:47,286 --> 01:10:50,158
I think Aaron needs to hear
that you want him to, Margaret.

1293
01:10:50,289 --> 01:10:52,552
Aaron, I want you
to go back to school.

1294
01:10:52,683 --> 01:10:55,033
We have to change now
before it's too late.

1295
01:10:55,163 --> 01:10:57,775
Aaron, do you
believe your mother?

1296
01:10:57,905 --> 01:11:00,081
I'm not going back.

1297
01:11:00,212 --> 01:11:01,474
I don't want to go back

1298
01:11:01,605 --> 01:11:03,084
Well, Erin, you have to.

1299
01:11:03,215 --> 01:11:04,999
Otherwise, we can't be together.

1300
01:11:05,130 --> 01:11:07,132
See, this-- this
is my fault. I'm

1301
01:11:07,263 --> 01:11:09,308
trying as hard as I can to
cope, but-- but sometimes I

1302
01:11:09,439 --> 01:11:11,832
need Aaron to help
me come back down.

1303
01:11:11,963 --> 01:11:14,139
You're too dependent
on him, Margaret.

1304
01:11:14,270 --> 01:11:17,185
Well, what do I do when I
get scared and I need him?

1305
01:11:17,316 --> 01:11:20,711
You say, I'm feeling rotten,
but I want you to go to school.

1306
01:11:20,841 --> 01:11:22,278
Just like that?

1307
01:11:22,408 --> 01:11:25,063
You have no other
choice, Margaret.

1308
01:11:25,193 --> 01:11:27,413
I don't like school.

1309
01:11:27,544 --> 01:11:28,849
Why?

1310
01:11:28,980 --> 01:11:30,634
I'm bored.

1311
01:11:30,764 --> 01:11:33,724
And I think
there's more to this.

1312
01:11:33,854 --> 01:11:35,769
I don't have
any friends there.

1313
01:11:35,900 --> 01:11:38,381
You won't make
any staying at home.

1314
01:11:38,511 --> 01:11:42,298
Maybe there's something
else going on here.

1315
01:11:42,428 --> 01:11:44,822
Are you afraid that if
you come home from school

1316
01:11:44,952 --> 01:11:46,954
your mom won't be there?

1317
01:11:47,085 --> 01:11:48,782
You afraid that
she might get sick

1318
01:11:48,913 --> 01:11:50,175
while you're away at
school, that she'll

1319
01:11:50,306 --> 01:11:51,959
end up in the hospital?

1320
01:11:52,090 --> 01:11:53,309
Is that what you're
worried about?

1321
01:11:56,007 --> 01:11:56,834
Maybe.

1322
01:12:01,752 --> 01:12:03,275
[traffic noise]

1323
01:12:03,406 --> 01:12:06,104
[IMITATING GROVER]
Hey, bright eyes.

1324
01:12:06,234 --> 01:12:08,193
Maybe It's time for
Lady Baby to stop

1325
01:12:08,324 --> 01:12:11,065
tagging along after you, aye?

1326
01:12:11,196 --> 01:12:12,763
Maybe it's time for
you to be a kid again.

1327
01:12:12,893 --> 01:12:14,852
I am a kid, Grove.

1328
01:12:14,982 --> 01:12:16,288
As a matter of fact, I'm nine.

1329
01:12:16,419 --> 01:12:18,638
[IMITATING GROVER]
Oh, too true,

1330
01:12:18,769 --> 01:12:20,727
but growing up too
fast having to take

1331
01:12:20,858 --> 01:12:23,948
care of a crazy Lady Baby.

1332
01:12:24,078 --> 01:12:26,907
I want to take care
of you because you're

1333
01:12:27,038 --> 01:12:27,995
such a special kid.

1334
01:12:33,740 --> 01:12:36,003
[telephone rings]

1335
01:12:38,092 --> 01:12:39,572
What?

1336
01:12:39,703 --> 01:12:42,009
What?

1337
01:12:42,140 --> 01:12:44,272
Oh, I'm sorry, Duncan.

1338
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:47,711
The official garden, yeah, um--

1339
01:12:47,841 --> 01:12:49,539
tomorrow?

1340
01:12:49,669 --> 01:12:51,715
Tomorrow, oh, oh, my--

1341
01:12:51,845 --> 01:12:53,673
can't you delay them?

1342
01:12:53,804 --> 01:12:54,848
Oh, my God.

1343
01:12:54,979 --> 01:12:56,676
Um, what time tomorrow?

1344
01:12:56,807 --> 01:12:58,983
Um, uh, yes.

1345
01:12:59,113 --> 01:13:00,550
W-- uh, oh.

1346
01:13:00,680 --> 01:13:01,507
Oh, I'm better.

1347
01:13:01,638 --> 01:13:02,900
I'm better.

1348
01:13:03,030 --> 01:13:07,557
Um, Y-- w-- when is the hearing?

1349
01:13:07,687 --> 01:13:08,906
[margaret sighs]

1350
01:13:10,298 --> 01:13:11,125
Yeah.

1351
01:13:13,780 --> 01:13:14,651
Oh.

1352
01:13:20,700 --> 01:13:22,876
Oh, don't do this.

1353
01:13:23,007 --> 01:13:23,834
Don't do this.

1354
01:13:36,629 --> 01:13:44,898
Would you please tell my son I
will see him when he gets home.

1355
01:13:45,029 --> 01:13:47,074
I'll tell him.

1356
01:13:47,205 --> 01:13:48,598
I understand.

1357
01:13:48,728 --> 01:13:51,078
Goodbye.

1358
01:13:51,209 --> 01:13:53,211
Your mom said she'd see
you when you get home.

1359
01:13:53,341 --> 01:13:55,779
[music playing]

1360
01:14:17,975 --> 01:14:20,194
[traffic noise]

1361
01:14:25,548 --> 01:14:27,463
The tea will be ready
in a minute, Mr. Perkins.

1362
01:14:36,123 --> 01:14:38,735
Oh.

1363
01:14:38,865 --> 01:14:41,694
Uh, Mr. Perkins?

1364
01:14:41,825 --> 01:14:43,435
Oh.

1365
01:14:43,566 --> 01:14:44,784
Oh, I had to repair
that damn window--

1366
01:14:44,915 --> 01:14:46,264
that window myself.

1367
01:14:46,394 --> 01:14:47,961
Um, here's your
tea, Mr. Perkins.

1368
01:14:48,092 --> 01:14:48,962
No, none for me.

1369
01:14:49,093 --> 01:14:51,399
Thank you.

1370
01:14:51,530 --> 01:14:52,966
How long have you lived
here, Miss Gibson?

1371
01:14:53,097 --> 01:14:54,968
Uh, six weeks.

1372
01:14:55,099 --> 01:14:56,361
I've applied to the
city for assistance

1373
01:14:56,492 --> 01:14:58,450
and more decent size apartment.

1374
01:14:58,581 --> 01:15:00,365
I've been on the list of
applicants for some time now.

1375
01:15:00,496 --> 01:15:02,367
Well, how do
you intend to meet

1376
01:15:02,498 --> 01:15:04,717
Aaron's material
needs, Miss Gibson,

1377
01:15:04,848 --> 01:15:06,284
other than through welfare?

1378
01:15:06,414 --> 01:15:08,199
Is being on welfare
sufficient reason

1379
01:15:08,329 --> 01:15:09,679
to take my son away from me?

1380
01:15:09,809 --> 01:15:11,594
Oh, no, no, no.

1381
01:15:11,724 --> 01:15:13,900
But do you have an
alternative to welfare?

1382
01:15:14,031 --> 01:15:16,207
My writing.

1383
01:15:16,337 --> 01:15:19,863
The Butterfly Ward won
a Toronto Fiction Prize,

1384
01:15:19,993 --> 01:15:22,430
and it made, uh,
a pile of money.

1385
01:15:22,561 --> 01:15:24,781
And I bought a house
and lost a house

1386
01:15:24,911 --> 01:15:26,304
because, well,
among other reasons,

1387
01:15:26,434 --> 01:15:28,088
I-- uh, the second
book didn't sell.

1388
01:15:28,219 --> 01:15:30,482
Among other reasons?

1389
01:15:30,613 --> 01:15:33,137
That's a euphemism for going
into the psychiatric ward

1390
01:15:33,267 --> 01:15:35,487
of a hospital, but I went
in of my own free will.

1391
01:15:35,618 --> 01:15:37,315
And I got a good doctor,
and he really helped me.

1392
01:15:37,445 --> 01:15:39,622
I see.

1393
01:15:39,752 --> 01:15:45,018
Miss Gibson, what kind of effect
do you think your mental health

1394
01:15:45,149 --> 01:15:46,498
problems have on Aaron?

1395
01:15:46,629 --> 01:15:49,370
Oh, uh, Aaron understands.

1396
01:15:49,501 --> 01:15:50,807
Aaron's a very special boy.

1397
01:15:50,937 --> 01:15:52,069
He's not like any other boy.

1398
01:15:52,199 --> 01:15:53,897
He just wants me well.

1399
01:15:54,027 --> 01:15:55,202
In fact, he told me
that I'm getting better.

1400
01:15:55,333 --> 01:15:56,377
Really, he said that.

1401
01:15:56,508 --> 01:15:58,292
And I'm good for him.

1402
01:15:58,423 --> 01:15:59,424
In fact, Aaron once said
to me, Mommy, living

1403
01:15:59,555 --> 01:16:02,383
with you is a real adventure.

1404
01:16:02,514 --> 01:16:03,994
So you're writing again?

1405
01:16:04,124 --> 01:16:05,822
Yes.

1406
01:16:05,952 --> 01:16:07,998
Yes, and I hope to
finish this book,

1407
01:16:08,128 --> 01:16:11,088
and then I can provide Aaron
with all his material needs.

1408
01:16:11,218 --> 01:16:13,743
What do you do with your
son on weekends, Miss Gibson?

1409
01:16:13,873 --> 01:16:15,005
Oh, we have fun.

1410
01:16:15,135 --> 01:16:16,180
We play games.

1411
01:16:16,310 --> 01:16:18,008
We go to movies.

1412
01:16:18,138 --> 01:16:19,096
We troll for empty
pop bottles to cash

1413
01:16:19,226 --> 01:16:21,402
in, normal family stuff.

1414
01:16:21,533 --> 01:16:24,057
[baby crying]

1415
01:16:24,188 --> 01:16:26,016
Uh, sorry if I
sound too flippant.

1416
01:16:26,146 --> 01:16:27,887
My-- my friend Shirley,
she is an artist

1417
01:16:28,018 --> 01:16:29,846
and she says sometimes
I sound too flippant.

1418
01:16:29,976 --> 01:16:32,849
We like being
together, Aaron and I.

1419
01:16:32,979 --> 01:16:35,112
Aaron's poor
school attendance is

1420
01:16:35,242 --> 01:16:38,376
a serious matter, Miss Gibson.

1421
01:16:38,506 --> 01:16:40,639
Yes, I know.

1422
01:16:40,770 --> 01:16:42,902
I know that uh-- that-- that
upsets me too, Mr. Perkins.

1423
01:16:43,033 --> 01:16:43,947
Uh, but we've changed.

1424
01:16:44,077 --> 01:16:45,078
I've changed.

1425
01:16:45,209 --> 01:16:47,080
I really have.

1426
01:16:47,211 --> 01:16:49,430
So Aaron doesn't stay
home from school anymore

1427
01:16:49,561 --> 01:16:50,736
to take care of you?

1428
01:16:50,867 --> 01:16:52,564
No.

1429
01:16:52,695 --> 01:16:56,176
No, he did when I
was ill, but not now.

1430
01:16:56,307 --> 01:16:58,526
Now I take care of him.

1431
01:16:58,657 --> 01:17:02,008
Why do you think Aaron
should live with you?

1432
01:17:02,139 --> 01:17:03,314
Why?

1433
01:17:03,444 --> 01:17:05,316
Yes, why?

1434
01:17:05,446 --> 01:17:08,014
Because I love him.

1435
01:17:08,145 --> 01:17:10,060
Thank you.

1436
01:17:10,190 --> 01:17:12,105
I'll see you in
court in three weeks.

1437
01:17:12,236 --> 01:17:14,238
Well, see-- can you tell
me what you think of me?

1438
01:17:14,368 --> 01:17:16,066
I mean, three weeks is
a long time to wait.

1439
01:17:16,196 --> 01:17:17,502
I still have to meet Aaron.

1440
01:17:17,633 --> 01:17:19,286
I haven't made any conclusions.

1441
01:17:19,417 --> 01:17:21,462
When are you going
to interview Aaron?

1442
01:17:21,593 --> 01:17:24,074
Sometime next week.

1443
01:17:24,204 --> 01:17:25,031
Thank you.

1444
01:17:30,080 --> 01:17:33,605
Sometime next week.

1445
01:17:33,736 --> 01:17:35,128
Sometime next week.

01:17:47,097 --> 01:17:50,491

Leave, mama's boy.

Why don't you put
your mom's jewelry on?

[typewriter clicking]

1456
01:18:49,115 --> 01:18:49,855
What's wrong?

1457
01:18:49,986 --> 01:18:52,075
Nothing.

1458
01:18:52,205 --> 01:18:53,729
What happened?

1459
01:18:53,859 --> 01:18:56,296
I'm not going back to school.

1460
01:18:56,427 --> 01:18:59,082
Aaron-- Aaron, you have to.

1461
01:18:59,212 --> 01:19:01,867
Why can't I be here with you?

1462
01:19:01,998 --> 01:19:06,567
Do you realize how close
we are to losing this case?

1463
01:19:06,698 --> 01:19:09,005
We ca-- we can't do
this anymore, you know?

1464
01:19:09,135 --> 01:19:11,442
We have to be less
different now.

1465
01:19:11,572 --> 01:19:14,184
You said different was good.

1466
01:19:14,314 --> 01:19:17,317
Why can't I be different
and not go to school?

1467
01:19:17,448 --> 01:19:19,972
Because school
is good for you.

1468
01:19:20,103 --> 01:19:21,321
So we-- we can't give up.

1469
01:19:21,452 --> 01:19:23,149
The hearing is coming soon.

1470
01:19:23,280 --> 01:19:25,064
When?

1471
01:19:25,195 --> 01:19:27,066
Three weeks.

1472
01:19:27,197 --> 01:19:29,242
You have to talk to the
official guardian first.

1473
01:19:29,373 --> 01:19:32,942
What am I supposed
to say to him?

1474
01:19:33,072 --> 01:19:35,509
Just tell the truth.

1475
01:19:35,640 --> 01:19:39,035
But meanwhile, back
you go to school.

[laughter]

1479
01:19:43,909 --> 01:19:47,521
So how do you feel about
living with your mother, Aaron?

1480
01:19:47,652 --> 01:19:48,392
Do you like it?

1481
01:19:48,522 --> 01:19:49,349
Yeah.

1482
01:19:52,613 --> 01:19:56,269
Well, uh, what's it like?

1483
01:19:56,400 --> 01:19:59,490
She sees pictures in
her head that I don't see.

1484
01:19:59,620 --> 01:20:03,146
Oh, what do you do then?

1485
01:20:03,276 --> 01:20:06,410
I tell her they're
not really there.

1486
01:20:06,540 --> 01:20:09,239
Is it an easy life?

1487
01:20:09,369 --> 01:20:12,416
No, sometimes
it's a hard life.

1488
01:20:12,546 --> 01:20:14,374
Why?

1489
01:20:14,505 --> 01:20:16,159
I mean, can you tell
me why it's hard?

1490
01:20:16,289 --> 01:20:18,074
She's upset a lot.

1491
01:20:18,204 --> 01:20:19,379
And you?

1492
01:20:19,510 --> 01:20:22,687
No, at this case.

1493
01:20:22,818 --> 01:20:26,604
And your father,
does he get upset?

1494
01:20:26,734 --> 01:20:28,780
Mm-mm.

1495
01:20:28,911 --> 01:20:31,304
Do you like living with him?

1496
01:20:31,435 --> 01:20:36,483
Yeah, only I really
don't know him too well.

1497
01:20:36,614 --> 01:20:38,616
Uh-huh.

[school bell rings]

01:20:40,748 --> 01:20:42,446
How do you feel about
your mother's illness?

1500
01:20:42,576 --> 01:20:44,448
What do you mean?

1501
01:20:44,578 --> 01:20:47,233
Do you think she
depends on you too much?

1502
01:20:47,364 --> 01:20:49,235
I know she's
needed me sometimes

1503
01:20:49,366 --> 01:20:52,543
so she won't get sicker.

1504
01:20:52,673 --> 01:20:56,286
Well, your father's got a
good job and a nice house.

1505
01:20:56,416 --> 01:20:59,202
50 times nicer
than me and my mom's.

Only--

1507
01:21:00,333 --> 01:21:02,161
Only what?

1508
01:21:02,292 --> 01:21:04,642
I just don't
feel like me there.

1509
01:21:04,772 --> 01:21:06,905
You don't have to
take care of him, huh?

1510
01:21:07,036 --> 01:21:10,474
I'm used to living with
my mom my whole life.

1511
01:21:10,604 --> 01:21:13,042
Well, you don't
need to decide.

1512
01:21:13,172 --> 01:21:15,827
It's a big decision.

1513
01:21:15,958 --> 01:21:18,308
I'll try to decide
what's best for you.

dead in a ditch.

Well, why didn't you call?

how worried I was?

The petitioner alleges
Miss Gibson's diagnoses

1555
01:24:00,035 --> 01:24:04,430
is paranoid schizophrenia.

1556
01:24:04,561 --> 01:24:05,910
Would you agree
with that, doctor?

1557
01:24:06,041 --> 01:24:08,304
No, absolutely not.

1558
01:24:08,434 --> 01:24:10,480
Since Margaret's
been under my care,

1559
01:24:10,610 --> 01:24:13,787
I have never observed that kind
of pervasive disorientation,

1560
01:24:13,918 --> 01:24:16,442
looseness in logical thinking,
or delusional content

1561
01:24:16,573 --> 01:24:18,705
that's usually associated
with paranoid schizophrenia.

1562
01:24:18,836 --> 01:24:20,707
I see.

1563
01:24:20,838 --> 01:24:24,624
Dr. Teplitsky, in your
opinion, how capable

1564
01:24:24,755 --> 01:24:26,539
a mother is Margaret Gibson?

1565
01:24:26,670 --> 01:24:28,063
I don't want to paint
her a perfect mother,

1566
01:24:28,193 --> 01:24:31,414
but she is very
sensitive to Aaron and--

1567
01:24:31,544 --> 01:24:33,024
and concerned.

1568
01:24:33,155 --> 01:24:35,113
And I predict the
turmoil in her life

1569
01:24:35,244 --> 01:24:37,420
will subside with ongoing
treatment and the resolution

1570
01:24:37,550 --> 01:24:38,986
of this custody case.

1571
01:24:39,117 --> 01:24:40,771
Is Miss Gibson
stable, Dr. Teplitsky?

1572
01:24:40,901 --> 01:24:42,468
Well, it's a
question of degree.

1573
01:24:42,599 --> 01:24:44,514
She's much more stable
now than before.

1574
01:24:44,644 --> 01:24:46,516
She seems to be making
remarkable strides

1575
01:24:46,646 --> 01:24:48,605
in her ability to
deal with stress.

1576
01:24:48,735 --> 01:24:50,911
I'm just concerned how
the psychological turmoil

1577
01:24:51,042 --> 01:24:52,826
affects Aaron.

1578
01:24:52,957 --> 01:24:54,480
Shouldn't the boy
have a stable parent?

1579
01:24:54,611 --> 01:24:55,916
I've found no
evidence suggesting

1580
01:24:56,047 --> 01:24:57,831
that Aaron is suffering.

1581
01:24:57,962 --> 01:24:59,572
Perhaps there's more
damage under the surface

1582
01:24:59,703 --> 01:25:01,661
than you've been able
to detect, doctor.

1583
01:25:01,792 --> 01:25:03,315
The child has had to be the
parent, from what I can gather.

1584
01:25:03,446 --> 01:25:05,143
I think that's changed.

1585
01:25:05,274 --> 01:25:07,014
Over the period of time
that I've been seeing him,

1586
01:25:07,145 --> 01:25:08,712
he seems to be
getting more solid.

1587
01:25:12,368 --> 01:25:14,370
Do you swear that the
evidence you are about to give

1588
01:25:14,500 --> 01:25:16,502
the court in this
matter shall be

1589
01:25:16,633 --> 01:25:17,808
the truth, the whole truth,
and nothing but the truth,

1590
01:25:17,938 --> 01:25:18,852
so help you God?
- Yes, I do.

1591
01:25:22,421 --> 01:25:25,946
Mr. Perkins, what was your
finding in the case before us?

1592
01:25:26,077 --> 01:25:28,862
I must apologize.

1593
01:25:28,993 --> 01:25:32,649
Usually this is the occasion for
my definitive recommendation,

1594
01:25:32,779 --> 01:25:36,566
but I'd like some more time
to think the matter over,

1595
01:25:36,696 --> 01:25:38,568
Your Honor.

1596
01:25:38,698 --> 01:25:40,570
What is at issue here
is whether or not

1597
01:25:40,700 --> 01:25:42,702
a parent with a history
of mental illness

1598
01:25:42,833 --> 01:25:44,617
should retain custody
of this child.

1599
01:25:44,748 --> 01:25:48,839
We must determine what
is best for Aaron.

1600
01:25:48,969 --> 01:25:52,495
Although, according to the
testimony we've just heard,

1601
01:25:52,625 --> 01:25:56,934
she has made progress
and is maintaining.

1602
01:25:57,064 --> 01:25:59,850
Now should we risk
keeping Aaron with her

1603
01:25:59,980 --> 01:26:02,679
and possibly exposing him to
traumatic events in the future

1604
01:26:02,809 --> 01:26:04,637
should she have a relapse?

1605
01:26:04,768 --> 01:26:08,598
I find this, personally,
very difficult to decide.

1606
01:26:08,728 --> 01:26:10,600
Shall we reconvene next week?

1607
01:26:10,730 --> 01:26:11,992
Is that sufficient
time for you to make

1608
01:26:12,123 --> 01:26:13,994
a decision, Mr. Perkins?

1609
01:26:14,125 --> 01:26:16,606
Yes, Your Honor.

1610
01:26:16,736 --> 01:26:18,912
All rise.

1611
01:26:19,043 --> 01:26:20,653
This court is now
adjourned for the day.

1612
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:22,612
God save the Queen.

1613
01:26:22,742 --> 01:26:24,179
What gives you the
right to delay like that?

1614
01:26:24,309 --> 01:26:26,790
JUDGE: This court is
adjourned, Miss Gibson.

1615
01:26:26,920 --> 01:26:28,052
Margaret, calm down, please.

1616
01:26:28,183 --> 01:26:29,358
You're upset.
- No.

1617
01:26:29,488 --> 01:26:29,967
Margaret.

1618
01:26:30,097 --> 01:26:31,534
No.

1619
01:26:31,664 --> 01:26:33,666
We have to live with this.

1620
01:26:33,797 --> 01:26:35,712
You have no understanding
of how unremitting this is.

1621
01:26:35,842 --> 01:26:37,844
A week may not mean much
to you, but to us it does.

1622
01:26:37,975 --> 01:26:39,890
Perhaps you're giving
me the information I need

1623
01:26:40,020 --> 01:26:41,587
to come to a speedier decision.
- Margaret.

1624
01:26:41,718 --> 01:26:43,067
Please, Margaret.
- Oh.

1625
01:26:43,198 --> 01:26:44,895
Margaret, you
could lose Aaron.

1626
01:26:45,025 --> 01:26:46,766
You could lose Aaron,
and you can see him

1627
01:26:46,897 --> 01:26:48,072
every other weekend
until he is 18 unless you

1628
01:26:48,203 --> 01:26:50,030
do something to help yourself.

1629
01:26:50,161 --> 01:26:51,771
Use your strength
instead of your weakness.

1630
01:26:51,902 --> 01:26:52,642
Margaret, look at me.

1631
01:26:52,772 --> 01:26:54,034
Look at me.

1632
01:26:54,165 --> 01:26:55,906
You're a writer.

1633
01:26:56,036 --> 01:26:58,952
Write an affidavit to the court.

1634
01:26:59,083 --> 01:27:02,434
This could be your only chance.

1635
01:27:02,565 --> 01:27:03,348
I--

1636
01:27:06,699 --> 01:27:08,527
[typewriter clicking]

1637
01:27:08,658 --> 01:27:09,659
MARGARET GIBSON [VOICEOVER]:
I've been mentally

1638
01:27:09,789 --> 01:27:11,182
ill for periods in my life.

1639
01:27:11,313 --> 01:27:13,228
But I believe now
that with the help

1640
01:27:13,358 --> 01:27:16,100
of my doctor and medication,
the worst is behind me.

1641
01:27:16,231 --> 01:27:18,842
I'm determined to give my
son the nurturing he needs,

1642
01:27:18,972 --> 01:27:21,627
and I know how to do that.

1643
01:27:21,758 --> 01:27:25,196
One day, we saw a stuffed
toy in a drugstore, Grover.

1644
01:27:25,327 --> 01:27:27,894
I discovered I could
imitate his voice.

1645
01:27:28,025 --> 01:27:30,245
Grover saw us through
many hard times.

1646
01:27:30,375 --> 01:27:32,159
When there was
nothing else, he was

1647
01:27:32,290 --> 01:27:35,119
security, a friend,
and love of which I

1648
01:27:35,250 --> 01:27:38,209
had more than enough to spare.

1649
01:27:38,340 --> 01:27:41,821
I cannot give Aaron
fancy houses or new toys,

1650
01:27:41,952 --> 01:27:43,823
not even always food.

1651
01:27:43,954 --> 01:27:45,825
He has known hunger.

1652
01:27:45,956 --> 01:27:48,567
Although, I've often
given him my food.

1653
01:27:48,698 --> 01:27:52,267
I can give him my
words and words last.

1654
01:27:52,397 --> 01:27:54,573
The only thing I
can really offer him

1655
01:27:54,704 --> 01:27:57,533
is unconditional
love, no matter what.

1656
01:28:07,717 --> 01:28:09,980
Mark Perkins has reached
his recommendation.

1657
01:28:13,679 --> 01:28:16,421
[music playing]

1658
01:28:21,252 --> 01:28:24,560
And I concur.

1659
01:28:24,690 --> 01:28:27,563
[music playing]

1660
01:28:27,693 --> 01:28:29,913
[sound of children playing]

1661
01:28:59,334 --> 01:29:00,639
It's you and me, kiddo.

1662
01:29:00,770 --> 01:29:02,032
I knew it.

1663
01:29:02,162 --> 01:29:03,642
[music playing]

1664
01:29:03,773 --> 01:29:04,991
Moogie.

1665
01:29:05,122 --> 01:29:06,036
Moogie.

1666
01:29:13,260 --> 01:29:15,828
I guess a little
madness is allowable?

1667
01:29:15,959 --> 01:29:16,916
I have to make good now.

1668
01:29:17,047 --> 01:29:18,178
Yes, you do.

1669
01:29:18,309 --> 01:29:19,179
[laughter]

1670
01:29:19,310 --> 01:29:21,660
[music playing]

1671
01:29:21,791 --> 01:29:24,010
[applause]

1672
01:29:41,506 --> 01:29:47,599
Uh, I started writing
this poem a long time ago.

1673
01:29:47,730 --> 01:29:49,558
Uh, I finished it yesterday.

1674
01:29:49,688 --> 01:29:52,561
It's called Aaron.

1675
01:30:00,220 --> 01:30:02,222
You've done under
my skin dunning,

1676
01:30:02,353 --> 01:30:05,182
a mad hatter tick-tocks
six eight time,

1677
01:30:05,312 --> 01:30:07,706
the human heartbeat
pocket watch.

1678
01:30:07,837 --> 01:30:09,186
My belly was puffed
and stretched

1679
01:30:09,316 --> 01:30:11,188
like a pale and fat oyster.

1680
01:30:11,318 --> 01:30:13,320
My once trimmed
ankles, water swollen.

1681
01:30:13,451 --> 01:30:15,497
It did not matter.

1682
01:30:15,627 --> 01:30:17,890
The days and nights of
sitting alone in a cold flat,

1683
01:30:18,021 --> 01:30:20,110
the window cracked like
the jagged lash of a whip,

1684
01:30:20,240 --> 01:30:21,851
would soon end.

1685
01:30:21,981 --> 01:30:24,157
I, Margaret, was
going to give birth.

1686
01:30:24,288 --> 01:30:26,029
Then the cleaving,
the the dunning,

1687
01:30:26,159 --> 01:30:28,945
six eight beat stopped
within my oyster parts

1688
01:30:29,075 --> 01:30:32,601
and was held bloodied
and close to my breast.

1689
01:30:32,731 --> 01:30:35,473
You did not squall.

1690
01:30:35,604 --> 01:30:39,129
He was always a quiet baby I
was to say in the kitchen way

1691
01:30:39,259 --> 01:30:40,957
as the years passed.

1692
01:30:41,087 --> 01:30:42,872
He did not squall.

1693
01:30:43,002 --> 01:30:44,656
You were like a lone
and beautiful tree

1694
01:30:44,787 --> 01:30:46,484
in a riot field of weeds.

1695
01:30:46,615 --> 01:30:48,399
You did not hang out
with the crowd of kids,

1696
01:30:48,530 --> 01:30:51,141
but rather stand back
a little to the side

1697
01:30:51,271 --> 01:30:53,273
and wonder why they did
not understand your jokes

1698
01:30:53,404 --> 01:30:54,971
or who Dillon Thomas is.

1699
01:30:55,101 --> 01:30:56,102
You do.

1700
01:30:56,233 --> 01:30:58,496
It seems you always did.

1701
01:30:58,627 --> 01:31:02,065
Once weeping, I knelt
before you and cradled

1702
01:31:02,195 --> 01:31:05,242
your soft, small head.

1703
01:31:05,372 --> 01:31:07,549
I told you that I
was sorry that I

1704
01:31:07,679 --> 01:31:12,075
grieve for you, for me, for all
the unright things I had done.

1705
01:31:12,205 --> 01:31:14,643
Translucent hand
then patted my arm.

1706
01:31:14,773 --> 01:31:18,037
Two words, I understand.

1707
01:31:18,168 --> 01:31:20,866
That made it all worse somehow.

1708
01:31:20,997 --> 01:31:23,260
Now, at nine, you remind
me to take my pills

1709
01:31:23,390 --> 01:31:25,523
and to phone the
doctor when I'm crazed.

1710
01:31:25,654 --> 01:31:28,004
And always you bring my
pill bottles, offering them

1711
01:31:28,134 --> 01:31:29,919
up with renewed hope each time.

1712
01:31:30,049 --> 01:31:31,921
Always I swallow
the pills and say,

1713
01:31:32,051 --> 01:31:34,314
now I will never be sick again.

1714
01:31:34,445 --> 01:31:36,665
I fool no one.

1715
01:31:36,795 --> 01:31:40,364
You are a lone and beautiful
tree in a riot full of weeds,

1716
01:31:40,495 --> 01:31:44,237
and you did not squall.

1717
01:31:44,368 --> 01:31:47,240
[applause]

1718
01:31:47,371 --> 01:31:49,808
[music playing]

1719
01:33:07,016 --> 01:33:07,843
[cat meows]
