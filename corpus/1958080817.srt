00:02:17,858 --> 00:02:19,276
Girl's stuff!

45
00:02:19,278 --> 00:02:21,488
- Yeah, I know I
got it. I'm on it.

00:02:21,490 --> 00:02:23,785
- Today, today, come on.

47
00:02:23,787 --> 00:02:25,329
- I know, I know. God.

48
00:02:25,331 --> 00:02:26,248

00:02:26,250 --> 00:02:27,085
- Fuck.

50
00:02:28,170 --> 00:02:30,590
- First of all, you're late.

51
00:02:30,592 --> 00:02:32,093
- I know, I'm sorry.

52
00:02:32,095 --> 00:02:33,470
- Then you start your shift

53
00:02:33,472 --> 00:02:34,347
with a 10 minute
break in the bathroom?

54
00:02:34,349 --> 00:02:35,349
We're done.

55
00:02:35,351 --> 00:02:36,226
- I..

56
00:02:36,228 --> 00:02:37,813
- No, I'm done.

57
00:02:37,815 --> 00:02:38,480
- Roger, you don't
wanna do this.

58
00:02:38,482 --> 00:02:40,109
- No, no, no.

59
00:02:40,111 --> 00:02:41,111
I can find someone else.
- What is the store,

60
00:02:41,113 --> 00:02:42,113
without you and me?

61
00:02:42,115 --> 00:02:43,073
- You never change.

62
00:02:43,075 --> 00:02:44,075
I'm tired.

63
00:02:44,077 --> 00:02:45,286
Let me prove it to you.

64
00:02:45,288 --> 00:02:46,371
You know, no more excuses.

65
00:02:46,373 --> 00:02:47,373
- Oh my God.

66
00:02:47,375 --> 00:02:48,375
- No more being late.

67
00:02:48,377 --> 00:02:49,336
- She never stops.

68
00:02:49,338 --> 00:02:50,214
- Please.

69
00:02:52,511 --> 00:02:53,387
- Stop it.

70
00:02:56,477 --> 00:02:57,853
I don't know why you do this.

71
00:02:57,855 --> 00:03:00,316
You lose at this
game every time.

72
00:03:08,502 --> 00:03:10,127
All right.

73
00:03:10,129 --> 00:03:12,173
I guess we can go one more day.

74
00:03:12,175 --> 00:03:14,052
- Thank you.
- But no more bullshit.

75
00:03:14,054 --> 00:03:15,931
From now on, I mean it.

76
00:03:15,933 --> 00:03:17,350
I don't wanna hear
any more of this,

77
00:03:17,352 --> 00:03:19,354
I couldn't start
my car, you know,

78
00:03:19,356 --> 00:03:21,526
I had to take the
cat to the dentist.

79
00:03:21,528 --> 00:03:23,237
I fell asleep on the bus.

80
00:03:23,239 --> 00:03:24,657
From now on, you'll be on time.

81
00:03:24,659 --> 00:03:25,992
You'll be above reproach.

82
00:03:25,994 --> 00:03:27,203
You're gonna be...

83
00:03:27,205 --> 00:03:28,205
- Responsible.
- Responsible!

84
00:03:28,207 --> 00:03:29,374
That's shit, okay.

85
00:03:29,376 --> 00:03:31,673
One more fuck up
and you're done.

86
00:04:16,053 --> 00:04:17,220
- Hello?

87
00:04:17,222 --> 00:04:18,347
- Hey I-
- "Gotcha.

88
00:04:18,349 --> 00:04:20,017
Can't get to the phone right now

89
00:04:20,019 --> 00:04:21,604
so just leave me a
message, or don't.

90
00:04:21,606 --> 00:04:22,482
Peace".

91
00:04:25,363 --> 00:04:27,114
- Hey, hey.

92
00:04:27,116 --> 00:04:30,789
You guys look like you
would like some magic.

93
00:04:30,791 --> 00:04:31,666
- Oh magic!

94
00:04:31,668 --> 00:04:32,503
- Yes.

95
00:04:33,797 --> 00:04:35,464
Okay so,

96
00:04:35,466 --> 00:04:38,262
Keep your eyes on this red ball.

97
00:04:38,264 --> 00:04:39,767
Pop in here.

98
00:04:44,442 --> 00:04:45,735
- That's so cool.

99
00:04:45,737 --> 00:04:47,614
- Let's go in here

100
00:04:47,616 --> 00:04:48,616
and see if they have a
princess dress for Sarah.

101
00:04:48,618 --> 00:04:50,202
- I want a balloon.

102
00:04:50,204 --> 00:04:51,204
- Could you?

103
00:04:51,206 --> 00:04:52,583
- Yeah, no, for sure.

104
00:04:52,585 --> 00:04:53,710
- Do you mind watching
him for a minute

105
00:04:53,712 --> 00:04:55,296
while I run in real quick?

106
00:04:55,298 --> 00:04:56,423
- Actually, I...
- Thank you. Stay here

107
00:04:56,425 --> 00:04:58,429
with the nice balloon lady.

108
00:05:00,851 --> 00:05:03,437
- Be careful little prince,

109
00:05:03,439 --> 00:05:05,859
if you pop them all,
you'll turn into a frog.

110
00:05:05,861 --> 00:05:08,157
Sorry, I don't make the rules.

111
00:05:09,200 --> 00:05:10,746
- Make me Spider-man.

112
00:05:12,498 --> 00:05:15,210
- How about a flower?

113
00:05:15,212 --> 00:05:16,212
- Boring.

114
00:05:16,214 --> 00:05:16,881
Those are for girls.

115
00:05:16,883 --> 00:05:17,883
- Dude, no.

116
00:05:17,885 --> 00:05:19,429
Princes love flowers.

117
00:05:20,641 --> 00:05:22,266
How about a sword?

118
00:05:22,268 --> 00:05:25,230
A sword for a brave
knight like you?

119
00:05:25,232 --> 00:05:26,358
- Fine.

120
00:05:26,360 --> 00:05:27,611
- Okay.

121
00:05:27,613 --> 00:05:28,615
Sword it is.

122
00:05:39,887 --> 00:05:41,514
Okay, here's your sword.

123
00:05:41,516 --> 00:05:44,396
Tell your mom tips
are appreciated.

124
00:05:47,903 --> 00:05:49,738
- Oh, this is awesome.

125
00:05:49,740 --> 00:05:50,617
A wiener!

126
00:05:51,661 --> 00:05:52,786
Mom, mom.
- Ah,

127
00:05:52,788 --> 00:05:54,457
ma'am it's a sword.

128
00:05:55,544 --> 00:05:56,838
You little shit.

129
00:05:58,508 --> 00:06:00,593
It does look like a
sword, doesn't it?

130
00:06:00,595 --> 00:06:03,766
- Just gimme your jacket.

131
00:06:03,768 --> 00:06:05,522
- Please, Roger I...

132
00:06:08,862 --> 00:06:09,945
- Look, I don't wanna hear it.

133
00:06:09,947 --> 00:06:11,364
I got bills to pay.

134
00:06:11,366 --> 00:06:12,366
- Yeah.

135
00:06:12,368 --> 00:06:13,786
- I got a rent increase.

136
00:06:13,788 --> 00:06:15,414
You know, I have
online competition.

137
00:06:15,416 --> 00:06:16,751
I gotta put up with all of that.

138
00:06:16,753 --> 00:06:18,378
- Yeah.
- You know what I need

139
00:06:18,380 --> 00:06:19,882
is a good, responsible employee.

140
00:06:19,884 --> 00:06:21,470
Not some grown up kid.

141
00:06:24,560 --> 00:06:25,894
- Roger,

142
00:06:25,896 --> 00:06:27,398
I just found out I'm...

143
00:06:29,486 --> 00:06:30,612
I'm pregnant.

144
00:06:32,450 --> 00:06:33,659
- That's good.

145
00:06:33,661 --> 00:06:35,078
You haven't used
that one before.

146
00:06:35,080 --> 00:06:36,751
And you know what, how dare you?

147
00:06:37,920 --> 00:06:39,420
- Okay.

148
00:06:39,422 --> 00:06:41,466
I can prove it to you.

149
00:06:41,468 --> 00:06:42,928
- No, just gimme the jacket.

150
00:06:42,930 --> 00:06:44,973
- It was here just a second ago

151
00:06:44,975 --> 00:06:46,602
Just gimme one,

152
00:06:46,604 --> 00:06:48,355
second.
- You don't understand.

153
00:06:48,357 --> 00:06:49,442
You're fired.

154
00:06:50,904 --> 00:06:51,946
I'll put your check in the mail.

155
00:06:51,948 --> 00:06:52,908
- Whatever.

156
00:08:04,175 --> 00:08:05,760
- Hello?

157
00:08:05,762 --> 00:08:07,639
- We are closing.

158
00:08:07,641 --> 00:08:09,685
Our regular office hours are
Monday to Friday, nine to six.

159
00:08:09,687 --> 00:08:12,607
Saturday by appointment only.

160
00:08:12,609 --> 00:08:15,112
- Right, I just really
need to see a doctor.

161
00:08:15,114 --> 00:08:17,659
- Do you have an appointment?

162
00:08:17,661 --> 00:08:19,120
- No.

163
00:08:19,122 --> 00:08:20,247
- I'm sorry, you have
to come back on Monday,

164
00:08:20,249 --> 00:08:22,126
unless it's an emergency.

165
00:08:22,128 --> 00:08:24,631
You can call, or go online
to schedule an appointment.

166
00:08:24,633 --> 00:08:26,885
- Right, but I think that
I'm probably pregnant,

167
00:08:26,887 --> 00:08:30,937
so that means I need to see
a doctor, like right now.

168
00:08:33,943 --> 00:08:34,820
Hello?

169
00:08:50,602 --> 00:08:53,021
- Oh no, she's
coming back again.

170
00:08:53,023 --> 00:08:55,777
- Hello, there's been
an emergency out here.

171
00:08:55,779 --> 00:08:57,697
- We are closed.

172
00:08:57,699 --> 00:09:00,620
- Right, but there's an
emergency with my breast.

173
00:09:00,622 --> 00:09:02,916
I think I have lumps.

174
00:09:02,918 --> 00:09:04,335
I wake up vomit.

175
00:09:04,337 --> 00:09:05,880
- Ugh I don't have
enough time for this.

176
00:09:05,882 --> 00:09:07,091
- I'm very nauseous
all the time.

177
00:09:07,093 --> 00:09:08,301
- Ma'am stop.

178
00:09:08,303 --> 00:09:09,888
- Sometimes I feel very lumpy.

179
00:09:09,890 --> 00:09:11,349
Okay, ma'am.

180
00:09:11,351 --> 00:09:12,936
It's okay, you can just

181
00:09:12,938 --> 00:09:14,689
ma'am, ma'am, stop it.

182
00:09:14,691 --> 00:09:15,691
I can see you.

183
00:09:15,693 --> 00:09:17,111
Look over here.

184
00:09:17,113 --> 00:09:20,033
Yeah hey, you were just here.

185
00:09:20,035 --> 00:09:21,202
And honestly, you
really need to work on

186
00:09:21,204 --> 00:09:22,914
that British accent, come on.

187
00:09:22,916 --> 00:09:24,668
- What if something
is really wrong?

188
00:09:24,670 --> 00:09:26,170
I don't wanna die.

189
00:09:26,172 --> 00:09:28,926
- Hey, doc, can you take
one last person please?

190
00:09:28,928 --> 00:09:29,803
- Okay.

191
00:09:32,309 --> 00:09:35,188
Today's office visit could
range from $30 to $250,

192
00:09:35,190 --> 00:09:37,276
depending on what the
doctor recommends.

193
00:09:37,278 --> 00:09:40,073
A typical uninsured
visit is $470.

194
00:09:40,075 --> 00:09:41,660
Do you have health insurance?

195
00:09:41,662 --> 00:09:42,787
- No.

196
00:09:42,789 --> 00:09:43,666
- Okay.

197
00:09:44,751 --> 00:09:46,127
Obamacare, Medicare maybe?

198
00:09:46,129 --> 00:09:47,839
- I missed those deadlines.

199
00:09:47,841 --> 00:09:49,300
- All right.

200
00:09:49,302 --> 00:09:52,055
You may benefit from a
federal support program.

201
00:09:52,057 --> 00:09:52,934
Let's see.

202
00:09:54,145 --> 00:09:55,688
Do you have a job?

203
00:09:55,690 --> 00:09:56,355
- Yes.

204
00:09:56,357 --> 00:09:57,692
No.

205
00:09:57,694 --> 00:09:59,153
- Yes, or no?

206
00:09:59,155 --> 00:10:01,032
- Not anymore.

207
00:10:01,034 --> 00:10:02,409
- Okay, no job.

208
00:10:02,411 --> 00:10:04,956
No health insurance, Jesus.

209
00:10:04,958 --> 00:10:07,171
Do you have any dependents?

210
00:10:09,425 --> 00:10:11,219
Outside of yourself do
you care for anyone?

211
00:10:11,221 --> 00:10:12,513
A child, parents?
- Right.

212
00:10:12,515 --> 00:10:14,352
No, nah, it's just me.

213
00:10:15,521 --> 00:10:16,523
- All right.

214
00:10:22,076 --> 00:10:25,497
Do you make more than
$17,237 per year?

215
00:10:25,499 --> 00:10:27,378
- That is so specific.

216
00:10:29,257 --> 00:10:30,133
I think ...

217
00:10:31,971 --> 00:10:33,221
no.

218
00:10:33,223 --> 00:10:34,808
- Okay.
- No, I am very poor.

219
00:10:34,810 --> 00:10:35,977
- Smart choice.

220
00:10:35,979 --> 00:10:37,104
All right, you're good.

221
00:10:37,106 --> 00:10:38,565
You don't have to pay today.

222
00:10:38,567 --> 00:10:42,324
Take a seat and fill out
the intake paperwork.

223
00:10:56,937 --> 00:10:58,396
- Hey mom,

224
00:10:58,398 --> 00:10:59,440
I can't really talk right now.
- Hi sweetie.

225
00:10:59,442 --> 00:11:00,609
How are you?

226
00:11:00,611 --> 00:11:02,195
- Yeah, no, I'm good, just...

227
00:11:02,197 --> 00:11:03,949
- Are you still at work?

228
00:11:03,951 --> 00:11:05,118
- Yep.

229
00:11:05,120 --> 00:11:07,247
Just making some balloons.

230
00:11:07,249 --> 00:11:08,959
- Listen, I just wanna know
if we'll have the honor

231
00:11:08,961 --> 00:11:10,840
of seeing you tomorrow?

232
00:11:12,552 --> 00:11:15,138
- What's the plan tomorrow?

233
00:11:15,140 --> 00:11:16,265
- Mother's Day.

234
00:11:16,267 --> 00:11:17,478
Did you forget?

235
00:11:19,941 --> 00:11:21,317
- No, no.

236
00:11:21,319 --> 00:11:23,363
I mean, how could I
forget your special day?

237
00:11:23,365 --> 00:11:25,241
- Your sister's in town.

238
00:11:25,243 --> 00:11:27,371
I'd appreciate if you two
didn't fight for once.

239
00:11:27,373 --> 00:11:29,041
- Okay.

240
00:11:29,043 --> 00:11:30,628
- Hey, Cherry.

241
00:11:30,630 --> 00:11:32,548
- Yeah, mom I gotta go.

242
00:11:32,550 --> 00:11:34,343
- It's grandma's recipe.
- Take your time.

243
00:11:34,345 --> 00:11:35,971
- It's been cooking for hours.

244
00:11:35,973 --> 00:11:37,140
- Yeah, I know. I
really gotta go.

245
00:11:37,142 --> 00:11:38,936
- Okay, sweetie.
- Yeah, okay.

246
00:11:38,938 --> 00:11:39,938
- Love you.

247
00:11:39,940 --> 00:11:41,025
- See you tomorrow.

248
00:11:43,363 --> 00:11:47,119
That's for you... I'm
so sorry about that.

249
00:11:47,121 --> 00:11:48,373
- Come on. Hands!

250
00:11:52,005 --> 00:11:52,674
Come on.

251
00:11:56,974 --> 00:11:58,517
- Yeah, just,

252
00:11:58,519 --> 00:11:59,686
I'll see you in five minutes.

253
00:11:59,688 --> 00:12:01,063
Okay, see you soon.

254
00:12:01,065 --> 00:12:02,149
Bye.

255
00:12:02,151 --> 00:12:03,401
- Have a seat.

256
00:12:03,403 --> 00:12:05,321
- Thank you.

257
00:12:05,323 --> 00:12:08,494
- All right, so Cherry, you
have a pain in the breast.

258
00:12:08,496 --> 00:12:10,541
So, what I'm gonna do is
I'm gonna give you a robe

259
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:12,169
You're gonna put that on.

260
00:12:12,171 --> 00:12:13,463
I'm gonna come back in
a few moments, okay?

261
00:12:13,465 --> 00:12:15,175
- Right so I...

262
00:12:15,177 --> 00:12:16,304
- Here you go.

263
00:12:49,245 --> 00:12:50,328
Can I come in?

264
00:12:50,330 --> 00:12:52,165
- Yeah.
- Okay, arms up.

265
00:12:52,167 --> 00:12:53,544
Yeah, you could put that away.

266
00:12:53,546 --> 00:12:56,257
Arms up, I'm just
gonna take this down.

267
00:12:56,259 --> 00:12:57,677
All right?

268
00:12:57,679 --> 00:12:59,556
And I'll do the
examination part,

269
00:12:59,558 --> 00:13:01,350
I'm just gonna start here.

270
00:13:01,352 --> 00:13:04,649
Do you ever self-examine
your breasts?

271
00:13:04,651 --> 00:13:05,651
- No.

272
00:13:05,653 --> 00:13:06,530
- Okay.

273
00:13:08,366 --> 00:13:10,536
Does your family have a
history of breast cancer?

274
00:13:10,538 --> 00:13:12,330
- I don't think so.

275
00:13:12,332 --> 00:13:13,457
- You should know.

276
00:13:13,459 --> 00:13:15,086
It's a good thing to know.

277
00:13:15,088 --> 00:13:16,548
Have you discussed
this with your mom?

278
00:13:16,550 --> 00:13:17,424
- We don't really talk
about stuff like that.

279
00:13:17,426 --> 00:13:19,094
- You should.

280
00:13:19,096 --> 00:13:20,096
It's important to know
what kind of illnesses

281
00:13:20,098 --> 00:13:21,558
run in your family.

282
00:13:21,560 --> 00:13:24,396
Gives you a lot of good
insight for the future.

283
00:13:24,398 --> 00:13:26,191
Okay, arms down.

284
00:13:26,193 --> 00:13:27,653
I can tell you that

285
00:13:27,655 --> 00:13:30,450
your breast exam is
healthy and normal.

286
00:13:30,452 --> 00:13:32,245
I think that we can just...

287
00:13:32,247 --> 00:13:33,582
- Sorry to interrupt.

288
00:13:33,584 --> 00:13:35,502
I need your signature
for the labs.

289
00:13:35,504 --> 00:13:39,386
- Okay, you can get dressed
and I'll be right back, okay?

290
00:13:45,398 --> 00:13:47,904
- Weird little alien.

291
00:13:55,293 --> 00:13:58,715
- Okay, so I am gonna print
out your medical report,

292
00:13:58,717 --> 00:14:00,803
and I can go, finally.

293
00:14:00,805 --> 00:14:03,307
I mean you can go,
and you can take this.

294
00:14:03,309 --> 00:14:05,813
- So I'm pregnant.

295
00:14:05,815 --> 00:14:06,650
I think.

296
00:14:08,277 --> 00:14:09,946
That's actually the
reason why I'm here.

297
00:14:09,948 --> 00:14:11,700
Also, I'm sorry for lying,

298
00:14:11,702 --> 00:14:14,496
but I took my test this morning,

299
00:14:14,498 --> 00:14:16,668
but then I lost it at
work and it said positive,

300
00:14:16,670 --> 00:14:18,672
but the box said 99% accuracy.

301
00:14:18,674 --> 00:14:23,264
And if I am the 1%, I mean,
that is so on brand for me I-

302
00:14:23,266 --> 00:14:25,978
- Well, you know, honestly,
Cherry to be honest,

303
00:14:25,980 --> 00:14:28,274
they say that just to
avoid lawsuits, okay?

304
00:14:28,276 --> 00:14:31,029
Those tests are fairly accurate.

305
00:14:31,031 --> 00:14:34,579
Okay, well, let's
just start over.

306
00:14:34,581 --> 00:14:36,710
We'll begin with
your health history.

307
00:14:39,339 --> 00:14:42,513
Okay, so which contraceptive
method do you use?

308
00:14:43,807 --> 00:14:45,976
- We go with pulling out.

309
00:14:45,978 --> 00:14:47,312
- Pulling out?

310
00:14:47,314 --> 00:14:48,982
Withdrawal.

311
00:14:48,984 --> 00:14:50,611
That's the least effective
contraceptive method.

312
00:14:50,613 --> 00:14:52,907
It doesn't prevent
against STDs either.

313
00:14:52,909 --> 00:14:54,286
- Yeah, I know.

314
00:14:55,371 --> 00:14:57,875
I was on the pill off and on,

315
00:14:57,877 --> 00:15:00,421
but I just don't like
taking drugs every day.

316
00:15:00,423 --> 00:15:01,633
I mean, hormonal ones.

317
00:15:01,635 --> 00:15:03,845
- When was your last period?

318
00:15:05,308 --> 00:15:06,935
- So, it's weird.

319
00:15:06,937 --> 00:15:09,105
I thought that I had
something a few weeks ago,

320
00:15:09,107 --> 00:15:11,360
but my boobs were really sore

321
00:15:11,362 --> 00:15:13,447
and I just kept thinking
that my period would hit.

322
00:15:13,449 --> 00:15:17,121
And then I waited a
week, and then two,

323
00:15:17,123 --> 00:15:19,710
and then I was too
scared to take a test

324
00:15:19,712 --> 00:15:21,508
and now I am here so.

325
00:15:24,012 --> 00:15:24,889
- Okay.

326
00:15:26,643 --> 00:15:27,645
Have a seat.

327
00:15:31,485 --> 00:15:33,489
The gel's a little cold.

328
00:15:41,715 --> 00:15:42,923
You all right?
- Yep.

329
00:15:42,925 --> 00:15:44,384
No, this is not weird at all.

330
00:15:45,931 --> 00:15:46,850
- It's not.

331
00:15:48,102 --> 00:15:50,023
Let's see what we have.

332
00:15:51,693 --> 00:15:52,818
We have something.

333
00:15:52,820 --> 00:15:54,029
You're definitely pregnant.

334
00:15:54,031 --> 00:15:55,491
- Oh my God.

335
00:15:56,953 --> 00:15:58,203
- And you are 10 weeks.

336
00:15:58,205 --> 00:15:59,749
- 10 weeks?
- To be exact.

337
00:15:59,751 --> 00:16:01,586
- How is that even possible?

338
00:16:01,588 --> 00:16:03,464
- Well, we calculate
it from the first day

339
00:16:03,466 --> 00:16:05,134
of your last period.

340
00:16:05,136 --> 00:16:08,140
So, right now you're
entering your 11th week

341
00:16:08,142 --> 00:16:10,562
and the fetus, just so you know,

342
00:16:10,564 --> 00:16:13,612
it's about the size
of a big raspberry.

343
00:16:15,616 --> 00:16:16,950
You mentioned that you
had your last period

344
00:16:16,952 --> 00:16:17,910
at the beginning of March.

345
00:16:17,912 --> 00:16:19,162
Is that right?

346
00:16:19,164 --> 00:16:20,916
- Yeah, I think so.

347
00:16:20,918 --> 00:16:24,089
- So, that means you
would've gotten you...

348
00:16:24,091 --> 00:16:27,763
oh you would've gotten
pregnant around March 17th.

349
00:16:27,765 --> 00:16:29,519
- St. Patrick's Day.

350
00:16:31,021 --> 00:16:32,815
That was Nick's birthday.

351
00:16:32,817 --> 00:16:34,694
It did get a little wild.

352
00:16:34,696 --> 00:16:36,279
- So, unfortunately you
don't have a lot of time

353
00:16:36,281 --> 00:16:38,660
to make some big
decisions, you know,

354
00:16:38,662 --> 00:16:42,041
for an abortion by pill,
you only have 24 hours.

355
00:16:42,043 --> 00:16:42,920
- Oh God.

356
00:16:47,012 --> 00:16:48,557
Can I see it?

357
00:16:50,894 --> 00:16:51,771
- Okay.

358
00:16:56,823 --> 00:16:57,658
- Whoa.

359
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,805
What's it sound like in there?

360
00:17:09,807 --> 00:17:11,141
- Are you sure?

361
00:17:11,143 --> 00:17:13,646
You don't have to.

362
00:17:13,648 --> 00:17:14,316
- Yeah.

363
00:17:40,243 --> 00:17:42,830
I'm terrified.

364
00:17:42,832 --> 00:17:43,959
I mean,

365
00:17:45,294 --> 00:17:49,844
the idea of a future
potential human

366
00:17:49,846 --> 00:17:53,392
just like swimming
around inside of me,

367
00:17:53,394 --> 00:17:55,398
is really, really scary.

368
00:17:57,653 --> 00:17:58,778
But then I was thinking about it

369
00:17:58,780 --> 00:17:59,657
and,

370
00:18:01,828 --> 00:18:03,746
it's kind of like a superpower.

371
00:18:03,748 --> 00:18:06,334
- Okay, well, have
you shared this news

372
00:18:06,336 --> 00:18:08,380
with anyone in your life?

373
00:18:08,382 --> 00:18:09,382
Dad?

374
00:18:10,721 --> 00:18:12,054
- Oh my God, my dad is like

375
00:18:12,056 --> 00:18:13,432
the last person.
- No, no, not your dad.

376
00:18:13,434 --> 00:18:14,352
The father.

377
00:18:15,313 --> 00:18:16,188
The father.

378
00:18:16,190 --> 00:18:17,816
- Right.

379
00:18:17,818 --> 00:18:19,152
- Nick.

380
00:18:22,828 --> 00:18:24,120
- What would you do?

381
00:18:24,122 --> 00:18:25,707
- Would I do?

382
00:18:25,709 --> 00:18:27,043
I don't think you should
be asking me that.

383
00:18:27,045 --> 00:18:29,424
I'm not the one
sitting there pregnant.

384
00:18:30,510 --> 00:18:33,015
Yes you know what I mean.

385
00:18:34,309 --> 00:18:35,186
- Yeah.

386
00:18:38,234 --> 00:18:42,991
So, outside of a boy, or a girl,

387
00:18:42,993 --> 00:18:44,369
what are my options?

388
00:18:44,371 --> 00:18:46,999
- You have two
options, right now.

389
00:18:47,001 --> 00:18:48,878
If you choose to do nothing,

390
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:50,882
you're gonna have a baby to
take care of in a few months.

391
00:18:50,884 --> 00:18:52,093
Okay?

392
00:18:52,095 --> 00:18:54,013
If you decide not to go forward,

393
00:18:54,015 --> 00:18:56,268
here in California,
you have until 11 weeks

394
00:18:56,270 --> 00:18:57,938
for an abortion by pill,

395
00:18:57,940 --> 00:18:59,900
until 24 weeks for
surgical abortion.

396
00:18:59,902 --> 00:19:03,825
And it's a more costly, and
it's a heavier procedure.

397
00:19:03,827 --> 00:19:05,494
That's it.

398
00:19:05,496 --> 00:19:06,456
- Ya.

399
00:19:09,462 --> 00:19:12,594
I just never thought
this would be me.

400
00:19:14,180 --> 00:19:17,268
There's nothing wrong
with it. It's just...

401
00:19:17,270 --> 00:19:19,355
It's other girls
that get abortions.

402
00:19:19,357 --> 00:19:21,234
- I know.

403
00:19:21,236 --> 00:19:24,282
It's not on our bucket list
of things to do in life.

404
00:19:24,284 --> 00:19:25,119
I get you.

405
00:19:26,455 --> 00:19:28,081
Just so you know,

406
00:19:28,083 --> 00:19:30,252
an abortion by pill is
similar to a miscarriage

407
00:19:30,254 --> 00:19:31,881
and it costs $500.

408
00:19:31,883 --> 00:19:33,050
- 500 bucks?
- Yes.

409
00:19:33,052 --> 00:19:34,427
But you don't have to worry,

410
00:19:34,429 --> 00:19:37,060
'cause health insurance
covers most of it.

411
00:19:39,940 --> 00:19:40,609
Let's see...

412
00:19:43,364 --> 00:19:44,491
okay

413
00:19:47,413 --> 00:19:49,000
you don't have it.

414
00:19:50,294 --> 00:19:52,547
Cherry having a baby,

415
00:19:52,549 --> 00:19:55,970
it can be a beautiful
thing, trust me.

416
00:19:55,972 --> 00:19:58,185
But it'll change your life.

417
00:19:59,229 --> 00:20:01,274
Turn it right upside down.

418
00:20:03,530 --> 00:20:06,536
- But it'll make
me an adult, right?

419
00:20:07,538 --> 00:20:09,124
- Not necessarily.

420
00:20:11,128 --> 00:20:13,255
Listen, you have
to think about it.

421
00:20:13,257 --> 00:20:14,716
You gotta take your time.

422
00:20:14,718 --> 00:20:17,346
You gotta make this
decision yourself.

423
00:20:17,348 --> 00:20:20,436
What I can do for you is
just make an appointment

424
00:20:20,438 --> 00:20:24,987
to come back Monday and you
can tell me what you decide

425
00:20:24,989 --> 00:20:26,406
and we can just
take it from there.

426
00:20:26,408 --> 00:20:27,408
How's that?

427
00:20:27,410 --> 00:20:28,243
- Yeah.

428
00:20:28,245 --> 00:20:29,538
- Okay?

429
00:20:29,540 --> 00:20:31,500
Promise me you'll come?

430
00:20:31,502 --> 00:20:32,376
- I promise.

431
00:20:32,378 --> 00:20:33,673
- Good.

432
00:21:14,170 --> 00:21:15,672
- "Can't get to the
phone right now.

433
00:21:15,674 --> 00:21:16,715
So just leave me a
message, or don't.

434
00:21:16,717 --> 00:21:18,051
Peace".

435
00:21:18,053 --> 00:21:19,387
- Hey Nick, please call me back.

436
00:21:19,389 --> 00:21:20,684
We need to talk.

437
00:21:23,523 --> 00:21:25,442
Where the fuck are you?

438
00:21:42,435 --> 00:21:44,437
Hey guys.

439
00:21:44,439 --> 00:21:45,565
- Hey Cherry,

440
00:21:45,567 --> 00:21:46,900
long time no see.

441
00:21:46,902 --> 00:21:47,738
- Yeah.

442
00:21:49,742 --> 00:21:52,831
You guys are looking
good, new outfits.

443
00:21:58,676 --> 00:22:00,887
- What is she doing here?

444
00:22:03,143 --> 00:22:04,435
- What the hell.

445
00:22:04,437 --> 00:22:06,272
Cherry? What are you doing here?

446
00:22:06,274 --> 00:22:07,692
I wasn't expecting you anymore.

447
00:22:07,694 --> 00:22:09,487
- Yeah I know, I'm
sorry I'm late.

448
00:22:09,489 --> 00:22:10,865
- Late?

449
00:22:10,867 --> 00:22:12,786
- I mean, I'd say
you're pretty damn late.

450
00:22:12,788 --> 00:22:14,790
Where were you for the bat
mitzvah and the baby shower?

451
00:22:14,792 --> 00:22:16,752
- Look, I am sorry
for being MIA,

452
00:22:16,754 --> 00:22:20,300
but I'm here now
and ready to roll.

453
00:22:20,302 --> 00:22:21,595
- Dude, it's been weeks.

454
00:22:21,597 --> 00:22:23,223
I thought you weren't interested

455
00:22:23,225 --> 00:22:24,225
in being part of
our group anymore.

456
00:22:24,227 --> 00:22:25,352
- No, of course I am.

457
00:22:25,354 --> 00:22:27,400
I just, I got busy, you know?

458
00:22:28,736 --> 00:22:30,613
- Right.

459
00:22:30,615 --> 00:22:31,699
I'm sure you're real busy
with what's his face.

460
00:22:31,701 --> 00:22:33,994
- Magic Nick!
- Stop.

461
00:22:33,996 --> 00:22:37,209
- Don't be jealous, you
know I love you more.

462
00:22:37,211 --> 00:22:38,673
- Well, I hate you.

463
00:22:40,300 --> 00:22:42,889
- Hey, can we talk
just for a second?

464
00:22:44,685 --> 00:22:47,354
- Yeah, hey I was actually just
gonna make an announcement.

465
00:22:47,356 --> 00:22:48,022
You're gonna love it.

466
00:22:48,024 --> 00:22:49,316
Can I go first?

467
00:22:49,318 --> 00:22:51,655
- Yeah.
- Okay, cool.

468
00:22:51,657 --> 00:22:55,872
So, I just got the
results for our submission

469
00:22:55,874 --> 00:22:58,334
for the Sunshine Summer tour

470
00:22:58,336 --> 00:23:01,382
and it looks like... we got it!

471
00:23:03,388 --> 00:23:04,639
We'll be touring
all across the US

472
00:23:04,641 --> 00:23:06,643
and Europe for six months.

473
00:23:06,645 --> 00:23:07,771
You guys did amazing.

474
00:23:07,773 --> 00:23:09,900
Rehearsals start next week.

475
00:23:09,902 --> 00:23:11,528
You guys rock.

476
00:23:11,530 --> 00:23:12,404
Thank you for all
your hard work.

477
00:23:12,406 --> 00:23:13,616
Now let's rock.

478
00:23:18,001 --> 00:23:19,878
- That is crazy.

479
00:23:19,880 --> 00:23:23,468
I mean, why didn't you
tell me you submitted this?

480
00:23:23,470 --> 00:23:24,470
- I mean, when?

481
00:23:24,472 --> 00:23:25,472
You weren't here.

482
00:23:25,474 --> 00:23:27,727
- Yeah, no totally.

483
00:23:27,729 --> 00:23:29,438
Tour, I mean.

484
00:23:29,440 --> 00:23:31,359
- Cherry, this is the
start of something huge.

485
00:23:31,361 --> 00:23:33,614
I can feel it, we did this.

486
00:23:33,616 --> 00:23:35,369
- Yeah, yeah we did.

487
00:23:36,789 --> 00:23:38,414
- Why do you look
like you just lost

488
00:23:38,416 --> 00:23:39,793
a roller contest in
the eighth grade?

489
00:23:39,795 --> 00:23:41,128
- It's just a big
surprise, that's all.

490
00:23:41,130 --> 00:23:43,509
I mean, it's amazing.

491
00:23:43,511 --> 00:23:45,428
Great

492
00:23:45,430 --> 00:23:46,849
- Cherry, you're starting
to scare the shit outta me.

493
00:23:46,851 --> 00:23:48,561
Please don't let
me down, not now.

494
00:23:48,563 --> 00:23:49,980
- Dude, I'm not
gonna let you down.

495
00:23:49,982 --> 00:23:52,484
I don't know ... I
need to think about it.

496
00:23:52,486 --> 00:23:53,779
- There's nothing
to think about.

497
00:23:53,781 --> 00:23:56,785
Listen, we're about to start.

498
00:23:56,787 --> 00:23:57,829
Can we put a pin on this?

499
00:23:57,831 --> 00:24:00,458
- Yeah, totally.
- Okay.

500
00:24:04,135 --> 00:24:05,678
Oh, I'm sorry.

501
00:24:05,680 --> 00:24:07,809
You can't perform tonight.

502
00:24:08,853 --> 00:24:10,605
- What?

503
00:24:10,607 --> 00:24:12,692
- We have all new choreography
and all new outfits.

504
00:24:12,694 --> 00:24:14,028
You can't wear this.

505
00:24:14,030 --> 00:24:15,656
I'm sorry...

506
00:24:15,658 --> 00:24:16,825
Here, why don't you
just take a seat,

507
00:24:16,827 --> 00:24:18,036
catch up for next time?

508
00:24:18,038 --> 00:24:19,081
- Yeah.

509
00:24:20,042 --> 00:24:21,459
- Sorry.

510
00:24:21,461 --> 00:24:22,714
- It's all good.

511
00:25:51,224 --> 00:25:52,892
- Hey, you catches the moves?

512
00:25:52,894 --> 00:25:54,146
- Yeah, totally.

513
00:25:55,357 --> 00:25:56,900
- You're okay?

514
00:25:56,902 --> 00:25:58,363
Something seems off.

515
00:26:01,745 --> 00:26:03,039
- Yeah. No...

516
00:26:04,250 --> 00:26:06,210
I got fired today.

517
00:26:06,212 --> 00:26:07,089
- So, that's a bummer.

518
00:26:08,007 --> 00:26:08,884
- Again?

519
00:26:10,638 --> 00:26:12,305
- You really know how to
make a girl feel better.

520
00:26:12,307 --> 00:26:14,309
- No, I'm sorry, but I mean,

521
00:26:14,311 --> 00:26:15,646
you weren't planning
on being a clown

522
00:26:15,648 --> 00:26:17,775
the rest of your life were you?

523
00:26:17,777 --> 00:26:19,654
- We have talked about this.

524
00:26:19,656 --> 00:26:22,827
I'm an magician, not a clown
and there is a difference.

525
00:26:22,829 --> 00:26:23,954
- I'm sorry.

526
00:26:23,956 --> 00:26:25,791
That sucks.

527
00:26:25,793 --> 00:26:27,795
But hey, at least you don't
have to quit your job,

528
00:26:27,797 --> 00:26:32,807
because I'm expecting full
commitment for this tour.

529
00:26:33,893 --> 00:26:35,853
- Yeah, I just, I don't know.

530
00:26:35,855 --> 00:26:38,399
I don't know if
I can go on tour.

531
00:26:38,401 --> 00:26:39,736
- What?

532
00:26:39,738 --> 00:26:41,073
What do you mean?

533
00:26:42,409 --> 00:26:47,085
- I don't know, I think
I wanna settle down.

534
00:26:47,879 --> 00:26:49,338
With Nick.

535
00:26:49,340 --> 00:26:50,173
- You're gonna throw
away your passion

536
00:26:50,175 --> 00:26:51,175
for a fling?

537
00:26:51,177 --> 00:26:52,344
- It's not a fling.

538
00:26:52,346 --> 00:26:53,471
I moved in with the dude, okay?

539
00:26:53,473 --> 00:26:55,477
Sorry if I have a love life.

540
00:26:56,437 --> 00:26:58,064
- Okay, I'm sorry.

541
00:26:58,066 --> 00:26:59,233
You love Nick and
Nick loves you.

542
00:26:59,235 --> 00:27:00,863
I get it.

543
00:27:02,199 --> 00:27:04,201
But you need to figure
out what you want.

544
00:27:04,203 --> 00:27:06,875
So, are you in, or are you out?

545
00:27:11,050 --> 00:27:12,219
- Look at them.

546
00:27:13,263 --> 00:27:15,098
Do you even need me?

547
00:27:15,100 --> 00:27:16,016
- What are you talking about?

548
00:27:16,018 --> 00:27:17,143
You're great.

549
00:27:17,145 --> 00:27:19,064
It's just, are you committed?

550
00:27:19,066 --> 00:27:22,445
You haven't been to
practice in weeks.

551
00:27:22,447 --> 00:27:24,408
- Look, honestly,

552
00:27:24,410 --> 00:27:26,997
this tour is just another
gig for what a few months

553
00:27:26,999 --> 00:27:29,126
and then we're right
back here in LA,

554
00:27:29,128 --> 00:27:32,092
dancing for fucking
birthday parties like..

555
00:27:33,929 --> 00:27:35,305
- So you just wanna quit,
give up on your dreams?

556
00:27:35,307 --> 00:27:37,352
- That's not what I said.

557
00:27:39,148 --> 00:27:43,281
- Like always, you never give
yourself a chance do you?

558
00:27:44,325 --> 00:27:46,327
- Things change.

559
00:27:46,329 --> 00:27:49,082
Dreams change and apparently,

560
00:27:49,084 --> 00:27:50,919
people change.

561
00:27:50,921 --> 00:27:52,380
- Classic Cherry!

562
00:27:52,382 --> 00:27:55,305
Let me know when you
figure out your shit!

563
00:27:56,600 --> 00:27:58,269
This party blows anyway.

564
00:28:46,073 --> 00:28:46,739
- Hey Steph.

565
00:28:46,741 --> 00:28:47,660
- Hi Cherry.

566
00:28:54,298 --> 00:28:55,465
- Hey, how's it going?

567
00:28:55,467 --> 00:28:57,262

- Hey.

572
00:29:15,633 --> 00:29:17,175
I'm sorry I didn't
call you back.

573
00:29:17,177 --> 00:29:18,469
I just kinda had a crazy day.

574
00:29:18,471 --> 00:29:20,348
You can't even imagine.

575
00:29:20,350 --> 00:29:21,518
- Oh I can.

576
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:23,103
- My console broke down.

577
00:29:23,105 --> 00:29:24,732
I had to run to
Lucas's and borrow his

578
00:29:24,734 --> 00:29:27,821
and meeting with the
band and I saw your text.

579
00:29:27,823 --> 00:29:29,491
Is everything okay?

580
00:29:29,493 --> 00:29:32,330
- Could we talk in private?

581
00:29:32,332 --> 00:29:35,127

- We're wrapping up this evening

587
00:29:48,155 --> 00:29:49,824
so it'll slow down.

588
00:29:49,826 --> 00:29:50,703

- Stop.

593
00:30:01,098 --> 00:30:02,432
- Oh my God, I
didn't even tell you.

594
00:30:02,434 --> 00:30:04,352
My manager called earlier.

595
00:30:04,354 --> 00:30:06,735
He wants to book me for
shows all over the place.

596
00:30:07,737 --> 00:30:08,612
- Cool.

597
00:30:08,614 --> 00:30:10,489
- I know, right?

598
00:30:10,491 --> 00:30:11,909
And then we got the album
coming out next month.

599
00:30:11,911 --> 00:30:13,287
It's gonna be crazy,
but it's gonna be good.

600
00:30:13,289 --> 00:30:14,584
- Yeah, totally.

601
00:30:15,836 --> 00:30:16,713

602
00:30:18,592 --> 00:30:19,468

610
00:30:45,938 --> 00:30:47,190
- No but you can.

611
00:31:14,369 --> 00:31:16,708
- Is this what was so urgent?

612
00:31:21,926 --> 00:31:24,722
- I love when you do that.

613
00:31:24,724 --> 00:31:25,934
- I love it too.

614
00:31:27,395 --> 00:31:28,439
- I love you.

615
00:31:37,917 --> 00:31:40,085
- I'm on the clock.

616
00:31:40,087 --> 00:31:42,843
I should probably
go back out there.

617
00:31:43,929 --> 00:31:45,471
- Okay.

618
00:31:45,473 --> 00:31:47,016
- I'm sorry.

619
00:31:47,018 --> 00:31:48,645
We can do this at home.

620
00:31:48,647 --> 00:31:51,859
- Your roommates
are always around.

621
00:31:51,861 --> 00:31:53,613
- I'm sorry.

622
00:31:53,615 --> 00:31:54,990
You coming back out there?

623
00:31:54,992 --> 00:31:56,702
- Yeah.

624
00:31:56,704 --> 00:31:59,499
- I'll see you out there.

625
00:31:59,501 --> 00:32:00,504
- Great.

626
00:32:29,185 --> 00:32:32,902
- This song is dedicated to
a very special lady, Cherry.

627
00:33:13,817 --> 00:33:15,109
- Could you watch the booth?

628
00:33:15,111 --> 00:33:16,614
Stick with disco.

629
00:33:19,494 --> 00:33:20,956
Let's talk outside.

630
00:33:24,254 --> 00:33:26,133
- Maybe it'll be a DJ.

631
00:33:40,704 --> 00:33:41,704
- Is this some kind of joke?

632
00:33:41,706 --> 00:33:42,789
'Cause it's not funny.

633
00:33:42,791 --> 00:33:43,710
- It's not.

634
00:33:44,795 --> 00:33:46,589
- Are you really pregnant?

635
00:33:46,591 --> 00:33:48,300
- Yeah.
- You're sure?

636
00:33:48,302 --> 00:33:52,141
- I mean, the doctor
seems pretty sure so yeah.

637
00:33:52,143 --> 00:33:53,185
- Holy fuck.

638
00:33:53,187 --> 00:33:54,022
- Hey,

639
00:33:55,567 --> 00:33:57,028
it's gonna be okay.

640
00:33:58,363 --> 00:34:02,036
- I just don't know
how it happened.

641
00:34:02,038 --> 00:34:03,875
We're cautious, right?

642
00:34:05,169 --> 00:34:06,587
I always pull out.

643
00:34:06,589 --> 00:34:08,217
- I mean, not always.

644
00:34:10,972 --> 00:34:14,268
Look, our families will help us

645
00:34:14,270 --> 00:34:18,151
and I am gonna get a new
job, a really good job.

646
00:34:18,153 --> 00:34:20,740
And you have a garage that
we can turn into a bedroom.

647
00:34:20,742 --> 00:34:22,368
I have so many friends
who did that in college.

648
00:34:22,370 --> 00:34:25,376
- Cherry, Cherry, I just
paid off a student loan.

649
00:34:26,963 --> 00:34:29,173
I work this job at night.

650
00:34:29,175 --> 00:34:30,927
We share a three
bedroom apartment

651
00:34:30,929 --> 00:34:35,060
with four other dudes
that smoke pot all day.

652
00:34:35,062 --> 00:34:36,772
I'm supposed to start my career.

653
00:34:36,774 --> 00:34:39,193
How are we gonna do
that with a baby?

654
00:34:39,195 --> 00:34:41,032
- We can make it work.

655
00:34:42,326 --> 00:34:43,326
- Lifetime.

656
00:34:43,328 --> 00:34:44,287
This is a lifetime.

657
00:34:44,289 --> 00:34:46,001
This is forever.

658
00:34:47,796 --> 00:34:49,132
- I'm not scared.

659
00:34:50,134 --> 00:34:51,134
I love you.

660
00:34:51,136 --> 00:34:52,931
- It's not about that.

661
00:34:54,434 --> 00:34:56,102
- Okay, so what's it about?

662
00:34:56,104 --> 00:34:59,778
- I had a great dad and
I wanna be a great dad.

663
00:35:02,158 --> 00:35:03,784
You know, I watched my dad

664
00:35:03,786 --> 00:35:06,164
just throw away
his dreams for me?

665
00:35:06,166 --> 00:35:08,836
You know how that made me feel?

666
00:35:08,838 --> 00:35:11,009
It was absolutely pathetic.

667
00:35:12,846 --> 00:35:14,430
You think that's pathetic.

668
00:35:14,432 --> 00:35:16,392
You wanna just spend
the rest of your life

669
00:35:16,394 --> 00:35:18,731
with your dumb band
pressing buttons

670
00:35:18,733 --> 00:35:20,275
and switching tracks?
- My dumb band.

671
00:35:20,277 --> 00:35:22,530
My dumb band, you love my music.

672
00:35:22,532 --> 00:35:24,160
- I do, I just,

673
00:35:25,496 --> 00:35:28,124
I know what a great
dad you could be

674
00:35:28,126 --> 00:35:31,381
and like your father and
I'm gonna try not to be

675
00:35:31,383 --> 00:35:33,051
a fucked up mom.

676
00:35:33,053 --> 00:35:36,266
- You're gonna try not
to be a fucked up mom?

677
00:35:36,268 --> 00:35:37,393
How the hell are
you gonna do that,

678
00:35:37,395 --> 00:35:39,105
when you can't even afford

679
00:35:39,107 --> 00:35:40,900
your own apartment Cherry?
- Excuse me?

680
00:35:40,902 --> 00:35:43,198
- It's just not a good idea.

681
00:35:45,077 --> 00:35:45,912
- Okay.

682
00:35:50,254 --> 00:35:52,172
- I don't want to have a kid

683
00:35:52,174 --> 00:35:56,431
and I especially don't want to
have a fucking kid with you.

684
00:35:56,433 --> 00:36:00,314
I like you, but this was
not part of the plan.

685
00:36:00,316 --> 00:36:01,942
It wasn't part of my plan,

686
00:36:01,944 --> 00:36:03,278
sure it wasn't
part of your plan.

687
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:04,282
We're young.

688
00:36:05,827 --> 00:36:07,537
- Okay, well I don't
need your permission.

689
00:36:07,539 --> 00:36:09,123
- You don't need my... what
the fuck are you gonna do?

690
00:36:09,125 --> 00:36:10,208
Have a baby behind my back?
- Maybe.

691
00:36:10,210 --> 00:36:12,463
It's my body, my choice.

692
00:36:12,465 --> 00:36:13,383
- Fuck that.

693
00:36:14,385 --> 00:36:15,304
- Fuck you.

694
00:36:18,268 --> 00:36:19,895
- I'm out.

695
00:36:19,897 --> 00:36:22,441
- Nick! What's going
on with the music?

696
00:36:22,443 --> 00:36:24,573
- Two minutes, I'm coming.

697
00:36:26,869 --> 00:36:28,495
Keep your damn
problems for yourself.

698
00:36:28,497 --> 00:36:30,165
- Stay stoned with
your roommates.

699
00:36:30,167 --> 00:36:31,960
- Give me back the
money you owe me.

700
00:36:31,962 --> 00:36:32,923
- Asshole!

701
00:38:26,734 --> 00:38:28,652
Hey mom, it's me.

702
00:38:28,654 --> 00:38:31,240
- Cherry is that you? On time?

703
00:38:31,242 --> 00:38:33,537
- Going upstairs,
will be right back.

704
00:38:33,539 --> 00:38:35,165

00:40:40,585 --> 00:40:42,670
I'm signing up for unemployment.

725
00:40:42,672 --> 00:40:44,423
The good news though,

726
00:40:44,425 --> 00:40:46,511
not sterile.

727
00:40:46,513 --> 00:40:48,180
Father is outta of the picture.

728
00:40:48,182 --> 00:40:50,059
Any support on weekend?

729
00:40:50,061 --> 00:40:51,980
- Cherry come down, help
your sister set the table.

730
00:40:51,982 --> 00:40:52,859
- Okay.

731
00:40:55,698 --> 00:40:56,533
Okay.

732
00:41:12,649 --> 00:41:14,651
- Miles Frederick went
from being a nice gentleman

733
00:41:14,653 --> 00:41:16,445
to a sexual maniac.

734
00:41:16,447 --> 00:41:19,577
There will be no
evidence of financial

735
00:41:19,579 --> 00:41:22,667
or family motive.
- Not guilty!

736
00:41:22,669 --> 00:41:23,545
- Hi.

737
00:41:25,758 --> 00:41:28,595
I feel like I saw you
wore that same outfit

738
00:41:28,597 --> 00:41:29,681
like when you were 12.

739
00:41:29,683 --> 00:41:31,687
- And it's just as cute.

740
00:41:33,983 --> 00:41:35,943
- Check out what I found.

741
00:41:35,945 --> 00:41:38,239
- So young and already
a little terror.

742
00:41:38,241 --> 00:41:40,076
- Oh my God.

743
00:41:40,078 --> 00:41:42,247
Do I need to remind
you this was my doll,

744
00:41:42,249 --> 00:41:44,294
my Dorothy. 96.

745
00:41:45,798 --> 00:41:47,132
Poor Dorothy.

746
00:41:47,134 --> 00:41:48,969
- What happened to her?

747
00:41:48,971 --> 00:41:51,015
- I think I burned her.

748
00:41:51,017 --> 00:41:53,146
I think you did too.

749
00:41:55,191 --> 00:41:56,985
Is everything okay?

750
00:41:56,987 --> 00:41:58,989
You look tired, I mean,

751
00:41:58,991 --> 00:42:00,953
even more tired than usual.

752
00:42:02,330 --> 00:42:04,876
- Yeah, I got knocked
up by my drug dealer

753
00:42:04,878 --> 00:42:06,295
and I'm probably
gonna live in my car

754
00:42:06,297 --> 00:42:09,761
for the rest of my life,
so I'm crushing it.

755
00:42:09,763 --> 00:42:10,848
- Very funny.

756
00:42:12,560 --> 00:42:13,979
Work's still going well?

757
00:42:15,691 --> 00:42:19,321
- I have like four
cases simultaneously.

758
00:42:19,323 --> 00:42:21,241
I'm still losing my mind.

759
00:42:21,243 --> 00:42:23,830
I might burn the place down,
but yeah, it's going great.

760
00:42:23,832 --> 00:42:25,667
Yeah.

761
00:42:25,669 --> 00:42:27,838
- Well I'm sure you'll be
running the place by next year.

762
00:42:27,840 --> 00:42:32,850
- Well sometimes I just
wish I could live on love.

763
00:42:33,644 --> 00:42:34,184
- Like you.

764
00:42:34,186 --> 00:42:34,646
- Yeah.

765
00:42:35,396 --> 00:42:36,731
- Hey, where's grandma?

766
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,069
- She's in there.

767
00:42:40,908 --> 00:42:41,868
- Hey gram.

768
00:42:44,874 --> 00:42:46,418
Cool shades grandma.

769
00:42:48,339 --> 00:42:49,676
What are you doing?

770
00:42:52,765 --> 00:42:53,767
- Amanda,

771
00:42:54,811 --> 00:42:56,940
It's so lovely to see ya.

772
00:42:57,900 --> 00:42:59,779
- It's Cherry, grandma.

773
00:43:02,785 --> 00:43:05,079
- Robert was such
a handsome man.

774
00:43:05,081 --> 00:43:07,879
But who is this
woman beside him?

775
00:43:08,964 --> 00:43:10,466
Oh I don't know.

776
00:43:11,385 --> 00:43:12,845
You want a raspberry?

777
00:43:12,847 --> 00:43:15,224
They're very good for you.

778
00:43:15,226 --> 00:43:16,813
A lot of vitamins.

779
00:43:20,028 --> 00:43:22,113
- Grandma, can
you keep a secret?

780
00:43:22,115 --> 00:43:23,407
- Sure.

781
00:43:23,409 --> 00:43:25,413
- Mom, do you need help?

782
00:43:26,415 --> 00:43:27,835
- I'm pregnant.

783
00:43:29,087 --> 00:43:32,217
- Again, at your age?

784
00:43:32,219 --> 00:43:33,095
- Again?

785
00:43:34,348 --> 00:43:36,018
Definitely a first.

786
00:43:39,483 --> 00:43:41,193
I can't stop thinking about it.

787
00:43:41,195 --> 00:43:45,117
You know, it's gonna
be a boy, or a girl?

788
00:43:45,119 --> 00:43:45,996
- Or both.

789
00:43:47,833 --> 00:43:51,004
- You know, maybe a baby will
gimme something to focus on.

790
00:43:51,006 --> 00:43:52,131
- Yeah.

791
00:43:52,133 --> 00:43:53,092
- Yeah.

792
00:43:53,094 --> 00:43:54,137
- No.

793
00:43:56,267 --> 00:43:59,897
You think I'll go to
hell if I get rid of it?

794
00:43:59,899 --> 00:44:03,322
I mean, I was probably
going there anyway.

795
00:44:05,911 --> 00:44:08,038
I just wish I could
talk to future me.

796
00:44:08,040 --> 00:44:09,499
She would tell me
what the fuck to do.

797
00:44:09,501 --> 00:44:11,086
- Amanda, at your age,

798
00:44:11,088 --> 00:44:14,136
the first time I
knew I was pregnant,

799
00:44:15,889 --> 00:44:19,269
I didn't eat for 20 days.

800
00:44:19,271 --> 00:44:21,273
- That's a very long time.

801
00:44:21,275 --> 00:44:22,611
- It didn't work.

802
00:44:25,491 --> 00:44:28,331
- But grandma, then
we wouldn't be here.

803
00:44:30,501 --> 00:44:33,172
- Well, I would've
had a different life.

804
00:44:33,174 --> 00:44:35,844
I would've been
fine with that too.

805
00:44:35,846 --> 00:44:36,514
- Huh.

806
00:44:38,225 --> 00:44:39,977
- Yeah, I would've been-

807
00:44:39,979 --> 00:44:42,983
- Cherry, mom, lunch is
ready, come and get it.

808
00:44:42,985 --> 00:44:45,572
- We should go before she
thinks you're abducted.

809
00:44:47,494 --> 00:44:50,164
- Oh, you know, I once had
an affair with a woman,

810
00:44:50,166 --> 00:44:52,003
but don't tell Robert.

811
00:44:53,130 --> 00:44:55,884
♪ I used to be a rock star ♪

812
00:44:55,886 --> 00:44:57,387
- Okay.

813
00:44:57,389 --> 00:45:01,228
♪ The prettiest girl
on the road star ♪

814
00:45:01,230 --> 00:45:04,025
♪ My heart was full of sparks ♪

815
00:45:04,027 --> 00:45:05,194
- We're dancing

816
00:45:05,196 --> 00:45:09,411
♪ My hands full of light ♪

817
00:45:09,413 --> 00:45:14,003
♪ I was the queen

818
00:45:15,592 --> 00:45:18,638
- I wonder what kind of
crap she has up today.

819
00:45:23,232 --> 00:45:25,401
- Anyhow, Bon appetite.

820
00:45:25,403 --> 00:45:27,990
- Robert loved New Year's Eve.

821
00:45:27,992 --> 00:45:29,660
- It's Mother's Day Mom.

822
00:45:29,662 --> 00:45:33,375
- We always had
our special time.

823
00:45:33,377 --> 00:45:35,087
- Oh.

824
00:45:35,089 --> 00:45:37,509
- When the kids
were off to sleep.

825
00:45:37,511 --> 00:45:39,179
- Okay, mom, that's great.

826
00:45:39,181 --> 00:45:40,473
Have some bread.

827
00:45:40,475 --> 00:45:41,559
- Happy Mother's Day mom.

828
00:45:41,561 --> 00:45:43,187
- Thank you honey.

829
00:45:43,189 --> 00:45:45,567
- Mom told me your room
is gonna be an Airbnb.

830
00:45:45,569 --> 00:45:46,445
- Yeah.

831
00:45:47,781 --> 00:45:50,367
- Yeah, Cherry's
almost done packing

832
00:45:50,369 --> 00:45:52,623
and I think the extra
money would come in handy,

833
00:45:52,625 --> 00:45:57,215
because I'm still negotiating
with mom's retirement home.

834
00:45:57,217 --> 00:45:58,676
Yeah.

835
00:45:58,678 --> 00:46:01,223
Not that I'm in any rush
to see grandma go away,

836
00:46:01,225 --> 00:46:05,272
but I raised two
lovely daughters and
I'm done with diapers.

837
00:46:05,274 --> 00:46:08,487
So, time for a little
time to myself.

838
00:46:08,489 --> 00:46:10,449
- That's a good idea.

839
00:46:10,451 --> 00:46:13,457
So you're gonna move
in with this boyfriend?

840
00:46:14,627 --> 00:46:16,798
- So, actually I think,

841
00:46:18,677 --> 00:46:20,595
I might do

842
00:46:20,597 --> 00:46:23,851
- Cherry, are you
gonna move back in?

843
00:46:23,853 --> 00:46:26,314
- I'm sorry you stayed for
like ever at Jeffrey's parents.

844
00:46:26,316 --> 00:46:27,693
- That was different
because I was an intern

845
00:46:27,695 --> 00:46:29,445
in New York, right?
- In New York.

846
00:46:29,447 --> 00:46:31,199
Yeah.

847
00:46:31,201 --> 00:46:32,703
- You don't know how
expensive rent is in New York.

848
00:46:32,705 --> 00:46:34,330
It's very expensive.

849
00:46:34,332 --> 00:46:36,167
- So, why don't you
just move back to LA?

850
00:46:36,169 --> 00:46:37,295
- Why don't you just
stop making everything...

851
00:46:37,297 --> 00:46:38,422
- You're too good for LA?

852
00:46:38,424 --> 00:46:40,426
- All right girls, cut it out.

853
00:46:40,428 --> 00:46:41,887
For once we're all together.

854
00:46:41,889 --> 00:46:44,560
Let's just have a
peaceful day. Okay?

855
00:46:44,562 --> 00:46:46,354
Anna, don't tease your sister.

856
00:46:46,356 --> 00:46:47,899
Not everyone has the
chance to go to law school.

857
00:46:47,901 --> 00:46:48,735
- Sure.

858
00:46:48,737 --> 00:46:50,697
- And Cherry.

859
00:46:50,699 --> 00:46:52,868
Your sister's right, time to
stand on your own two feet.

860
00:46:52,870 --> 00:46:53,705
- It is.

861
00:47:04,727 --> 00:47:06,227
- It's literally a
figure of speech.

862
00:47:06,229 --> 00:47:07,355
You didn't have to stand up.

863
00:47:07,357 --> 00:47:08,650
- I have something to say.

864
00:47:08,652 --> 00:47:09,652
- Who's dead?

865
00:47:09,654 --> 00:47:11,446
- No one's dead mom.

866
00:47:11,448 --> 00:47:15,705
- Cherry are you coming
out, to us right now?

867
00:47:15,707 --> 00:47:19,462
- I just broke up with
my boyfriend actually.

868
00:47:19,464 --> 00:47:20,715
His name is Nick.
- Oh honey.

869
00:47:20,717 --> 00:47:21,592
- Was Nick.

870
00:47:21,594 --> 00:47:22,719
Is Nick.

871
00:47:22,721 --> 00:47:24,305
We are not together anymore.

872
00:47:24,307 --> 00:47:27,311
And also, I quit my job
at the costume shop.

873
00:47:27,313 --> 00:47:28,898
But to look for
something better.

874
00:47:28,900 --> 00:47:31,904
A real job, a good job,
maybe even your job

875
00:47:31,906 --> 00:47:33,660
and oh my God, okay.

876
00:47:35,706 --> 00:47:39,503
To be honest, I am not
doing very well right now.

877
00:47:39,505 --> 00:47:41,549
I feel like kind of lost

878
00:47:43,011 --> 00:47:44,638
but you know, I'm
gonna figure it out.

879
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:46,684
I'm figuring it out
on my own, right now.

880
00:47:46,686 --> 00:47:50,817
Also, another very important
thing that I have to say is...

881
00:47:50,819 --> 00:47:52,403
can you please stop?

882
00:47:52,405 --> 00:47:54,323
I'm trying to do something.

883
00:47:56,496 --> 00:47:57,371
- Oh my gosh, pumpkin.

884
00:47:57,373 --> 00:47:58,875
What's wrong?

885
00:47:58,877 --> 00:48:01,547
- I'm sorry, I'm just
not doing well either.

886
00:48:01,549 --> 00:48:04,427
- Oh, what's the matter sweetie?

887
00:48:04,429 --> 00:48:06,014
- You know, Jeffrey
and I, we've been...?

888
00:48:06,016 --> 00:48:07,349
- Yeah.

889
00:48:07,351 --> 00:48:08,018
- Well...

890
00:48:08,020 --> 00:48:09,521
- What?

891
00:48:10,942 --> 00:48:12,026
- What honey?

892
00:48:12,028 --> 00:48:13,780
- Oh my God.

893
00:48:13,782 --> 00:48:16,409
- I can't get pregnant.

894
00:48:16,411 --> 00:48:17,411
I can't get pregnant.

895
00:48:17,413 --> 00:48:18,998
- Oh sweetie.

896
00:48:19,000 --> 00:48:19,877
Oh honey.

897
00:48:21,631 --> 00:48:23,883
I had no idea that
you and Jefferey

898
00:48:23,885 --> 00:48:25,804
were trying to have a baby.

899
00:48:25,806 --> 00:48:28,350
- Oh, we've been
trying for months

900
00:48:28,352 --> 00:48:30,020
and I took some herbal pills

901
00:48:30,022 --> 00:48:31,524
my friend referred to me.
- You know what?

902
00:48:31,526 --> 00:48:32,943
Nevermind.

903
00:48:32,945 --> 00:48:33,945
- What's going on?

904
00:48:33,947 --> 00:48:34,822
- Mother's Day drama

905
00:48:34,824 --> 00:48:36,659
for everyone.

906
00:48:36,661 --> 00:48:39,832
- I know how to cheer them up.

907
00:48:39,834 --> 00:48:41,669
- I feel like it
should, you know?

908
00:48:41,671 --> 00:48:42,921
- The minute you stop stressing
about it, that's when it-

909
00:48:42,923 --> 00:48:44,131
- Oh my God.

910
00:48:44,133 --> 00:48:45,927
- Happy New Year!

911
00:48:53,945 --> 00:48:56,534
- Okay, well so much for that.

912
00:48:59,414 --> 00:49:01,124
Ya?

913
00:49:01,126 --> 00:49:04,422
- Did you and dad have have
that problem getting pregnant?

914
00:49:04,424 --> 00:49:07,386
- Being preg, getting oh no.

915
00:49:07,388 --> 00:49:09,434
Not at all.
- Yeah.

916
00:49:11,856 --> 00:49:15,820
- You know, I think she
just is stressed out.

917
00:49:15,822 --> 00:49:18,910
I think she's just
working too hard.

918
00:49:18,912 --> 00:49:20,872
- Mom, did you know about me?
- Or,

919
00:49:20,874 --> 00:49:22,041
you know what?

920
00:49:22,043 --> 00:49:23,043
It could have been Jeffrey.

921
00:49:23,045 --> 00:49:24,922
- Did you know about me?

922
00:49:24,924 --> 00:49:26,759
- What about you?

923
00:49:26,761 --> 00:49:29,055
- If I was a boy, or a girl?

924
00:49:29,057 --> 00:49:30,808
- Oh,

925
00:49:30,810 --> 00:49:32,436
honey, well,

926
00:49:32,438 --> 00:49:34,733
you were definitely
supposed to be a boy,

927
00:49:34,735 --> 00:49:37,446
until you popped out a girl.

928
00:49:37,448 --> 00:49:38,991
Surprise!

929
00:49:38,993 --> 00:49:40,662
Well, surprise for me.

930
00:49:40,664 --> 00:49:43,249
Your father showed
up two hours late.

931
00:49:43,251 --> 00:49:47,594
So, what was it that you
wanted to talk about?

932
00:49:49,974 --> 00:49:52,602
If it's money, honey, you
know, I already told you

933
00:49:52,604 --> 00:49:54,105
I've helped you

934
00:49:54,107 --> 00:49:56,069
as much as I can.
- It's not always about money.

935
00:49:57,238 --> 00:49:59,073
- Okay, okay.

936
00:49:59,075 --> 00:50:00,743
Well, is it the boyfriend?

937
00:50:00,745 --> 00:50:03,582
- It's not always boys either.

938
00:50:03,584 --> 00:50:05,127
- Grandma always says,

939
00:50:05,129 --> 00:50:08,216
"After trains and
after men never run.

940
00:50:08,218 --> 00:50:09,928
There's always
one coming later".

941
00:50:09,930 --> 00:50:10,807
- I know.

942
00:50:13,563 --> 00:50:14,648
- What is it,

943
00:50:16,819 --> 00:50:17,654
babe?

944
00:50:19,616 --> 00:50:23,541
- Could I just stay
here, for a couple days?

945
00:50:25,210 --> 00:50:27,087
It's just until I
find another place,

946
00:50:27,089 --> 00:50:29,760
I really, really don't
wanna stay with Nick

947
00:50:29,762 --> 00:50:31,097
and I don't know,

948
00:50:33,644 --> 00:50:35,187
I could help grandma,

949
00:50:35,189 --> 00:50:37,193
take her on some walks,

950
00:50:38,153 --> 00:50:39,278
or to the ballroom.

951
00:50:39,280 --> 00:50:41,784
I know she misses dancing.

952
00:50:41,786 --> 00:50:43,788
- You wanna help, really?

953
00:50:43,790 --> 00:50:44,666
- Yeah.

954
00:50:47,046 --> 00:50:49,340
- Well, I'm not gonna let you
sleep in the street, honey.

955
00:50:49,342 --> 00:50:51,385
Of course you can stay.

956
00:50:51,387 --> 00:50:53,056
- Thanks.

957
00:50:53,058 --> 00:50:54,851
- And since you wanna
make yourself useful,

958
00:50:54,853 --> 00:50:55,978
bring that to the neighbor.

959
00:50:55,980 --> 00:50:58,901
They'll be happy to see you.

960
00:50:58,903 --> 00:51:01,241
Let's kick your sister
out of her mess.

961
00:51:02,284 --> 00:51:03,370
Hot pie!

962
00:51:06,000 --> 00:51:07,044
- On it.

963
00:52:10,880 --> 00:52:12,840
- So what happened?

964
00:52:12,842 --> 00:52:14,260
- I don't really know.

965
00:52:14,262 --> 00:52:16,138
I think she was making
like a weird noise,

966
00:52:16,140 --> 00:52:19,019
so I stopped and she just
wouldn't turn back on.

967
00:52:19,021 --> 00:52:20,564
Maybe it's the battery.

968
00:52:20,566 --> 00:52:21,902
- Let's see.

969
00:52:35,555 --> 00:52:38,934
You know, I can't believe
that old bug is still running.

970
00:52:38,936 --> 00:52:41,316
I remember your grandma in it.

971
00:52:45,073 --> 00:52:46,575
- Need some help?

972
00:52:46,577 --> 00:52:47,954
- No, I'm fine.

973
00:53:04,195 --> 00:53:05,195
- It's sunny.

974
00:53:05,197 --> 00:53:06,491
- Yeah, it's hot.

975
00:53:10,499 --> 00:53:12,002
- So, what's up?

976
00:53:13,589 --> 00:53:14,674
- Same, same.

977
00:54:12,624 --> 00:54:14,416

Come on,

988
00:55:06,565 --> 00:55:08,359
You feel it a little bit.

989
00:55:09,863 --> 00:55:12,449
- You are crazy, you know that?

990
00:55:12,451 --> 00:55:14,204
Okay, that's enough.

991
00:55:15,750 --> 00:55:16,710
We're good.

992
00:55:34,746 --> 00:55:35,871
- Hey, wait.

993
00:55:35,873 --> 00:55:36,833
Dad.

994
00:55:38,504 --> 00:55:41,173
How about some fruit?

995
00:55:41,175 --> 00:55:42,593
- No, I'm good.

996
00:55:42,595 --> 00:55:44,262
Didn't you have
lunch with your mom?

997
00:55:44,264 --> 00:55:45,264
- Well, yeah, but I
didn't have dessert.

998
00:55:45,266 --> 00:55:46,392
- Yeah, I gotta go.

999
00:55:46,394 --> 00:55:48,396
I'm out of time so.

1000
00:55:48,398 --> 00:55:51,903
- Do you really wanna
go back to work?

1001
00:55:51,905 --> 00:55:55,577
There's a coconut with
your name on it, please.

1002
00:55:55,579 --> 00:55:57,290
- All right quick.

1003
00:56:00,548 --> 00:56:01,548
- Hey.

1004
00:56:02,927 --> 00:56:04,762
A passion fruit salad, please.

1005
00:56:04,764 --> 00:56:07,434
- I'll have a fresh coconut.

1006
00:56:07,436 --> 00:56:08,729
Can we sit over there?

1007
00:56:08,731 --> 00:56:09,939
- Yes please.

1008
00:56:09,941 --> 00:56:11,360
- Great.

1009
00:56:17,957 --> 00:56:21,755
- So, mom said you were
expecting a boy with me.

1010
00:56:21,757 --> 00:56:22,633
- What?

1011
00:56:25,765 --> 00:56:28,560
- You didn't know I
was gonna be a girl.

1012
00:56:28,562 --> 00:56:29,396
- Oh,

1013
00:56:30,608 --> 00:56:31,568
yeah right.

1014
00:56:34,783 --> 00:56:36,578
- Were you disappointed?

1015
00:56:38,331 --> 00:56:39,793
- What do you mean?

1016
00:56:41,378 --> 00:56:43,466
- I mean, you
wanted a boy, right?

1017
00:56:44,761 --> 00:56:48,390
- I, you know, I
would've liked a boy.

1018
00:56:48,392 --> 00:56:51,856
But I'm happy with
you two girls.

1019
00:56:51,858 --> 00:56:53,654
You get what you get.

1020
00:56:56,408 --> 00:56:57,077
- Yeah.

1021
00:57:02,045 --> 00:57:04,590
So, when did you know
you wanted to be a dad?

1022
00:57:04,592 --> 00:57:06,511
- What is this,
like "50 questions"?

1023
00:57:06,513 --> 00:57:08,389
- I mean, did you and mom
just like wake up one day

1024
00:57:08,391 --> 00:57:09,767
and you were like
"Let's have babies".

1025
00:57:09,769 --> 00:57:11,436
- I don't know.

1026
00:57:11,438 --> 00:57:13,694
It happened, when
it had to happen.

1027
00:57:14,654 --> 00:57:15,488
- Right.

1028
00:57:16,575 --> 00:57:17,827
- What?

1029
00:57:20,833 --> 00:57:21,835
- I dunno.

1030
00:57:24,507 --> 00:57:28,682
It seems like sometimes
you don't really care.

1031
00:57:29,601 --> 00:57:31,521
- How can you say that?

1032
00:57:32,607 --> 00:57:33,732
I raised you.

1033
00:57:33,734 --> 00:57:34,650
I take care of the household.

1034
00:57:34,652 --> 00:57:35,946
I worked hard.

1035
00:57:37,032 --> 00:57:39,619
- That's not what I mean.

1036
00:57:39,621 --> 00:57:43,000
- You know, I'm always here
for you to move your stuff

1037
00:57:43,002 --> 00:57:44,714
and be your mechanic

1038
00:57:45,841 --> 00:57:48,010
and you're still alive.

1039
00:57:48,012 --> 00:57:51,768
So, I think I did a pretty
good job as a parent.

1040
00:57:51,770 --> 00:57:53,064
- Yeah, totally.

1041
00:57:57,155 --> 00:57:58,575
But you never call.

1042
00:58:00,161 --> 00:58:02,581
- I just, I don't like talking
on the phone, that's all.

1043
00:58:02,583 --> 00:58:04,209
- But you don't know
anything about me.

1044
00:58:04,211 --> 00:58:08,010
I mean, you don't know
where I live, or what I do,

1045
00:58:09,137 --> 00:58:10,597
or even the name
of my boyfriend.

1046
00:58:10,599 --> 00:58:11,935
- Of course I do.

1047
00:58:13,145 --> 00:58:14,270
Steven.

1048
00:58:14,272 --> 00:58:15,108
- Nick.

1049
00:58:16,945 --> 00:58:19,865
Steven was like two years ago

1050
00:58:19,867 --> 00:58:22,078
and Nick doesn't even matter.

1051
00:58:22,080 --> 00:58:23,080
We broke up.

1052
00:58:23,082 --> 00:58:23,875
You won't meet him.

1053
00:58:25,211 --> 00:58:27,213
And I lost my job,
so I'm a real winner.

1054
00:58:27,215 --> 00:58:29,217
- I didn't know
you had a new job.

1055
00:58:29,219 --> 00:58:31,138
- The costume shop.

1056
00:58:31,140 --> 00:58:32,225
- Oh, okay.

1057
00:58:40,826 --> 00:58:41,661
Look,

1058
00:58:44,291 --> 00:58:47,923
maybe I wasn't the best father,

1059
00:58:49,635 --> 00:58:50,303
but,

1060
00:58:51,806 --> 00:58:54,685
you know, things
were not easy for me.

1061
00:58:54,687 --> 00:58:56,023
Times were tough.

1062
00:58:57,860 --> 00:59:02,200
And you'll see when you get
married and you have kids,

1063
00:59:02,202 --> 00:59:03,745
you know, there will
be so many moments

1064
00:59:03,747 --> 00:59:04,747
that you want to give up.

1065
00:59:04,749 --> 00:59:05,874
But I didn't give up.

1066
00:59:05,876 --> 00:59:09,047
I'm still here for you girls.

1067
00:59:09,049 --> 00:59:11,969
You know you were wanted,

1068
00:59:11,971 --> 00:59:12,848
right?

1069
00:59:22,910 --> 00:59:25,914
I really gotta get back to work.

1070
00:59:25,916 --> 00:59:27,333
- Yeah.

1071
00:59:27,335 --> 00:59:29,420
- Here, there's
some cash in there.

1072
00:59:29,422 --> 00:59:33,640
I'm gonna use the bathroom
next door, I'll be right back.

1073
01:00:03,240 --> 01:00:05,203
- Three dollars please.

1074
01:00:22,320 --> 01:00:24,030
Cherry let's go.

1075
01:00:24,032 --> 01:00:24,909
Thanks.

1076
01:00:38,979 --> 01:00:40,187
- Thanks for the help.

1077
01:00:40,189 --> 01:00:41,400
- You're welcome.

1078
01:00:42,861 --> 01:00:43,530
Bye.

1079
01:00:47,370 --> 01:00:48,372

1123

- You can't call
me that anymore.

1124
01:04:29,940 --> 01:04:32,317
What do you want?

1125
01:04:32,319 --> 01:04:34,363
- You didn't pick up your phone.

1126
01:04:34,365 --> 01:04:35,908
I thought maybe you needed it.

1127
01:04:35,910 --> 01:04:36,787
- Thanks.

1128
01:04:39,041 --> 01:04:40,626
Okay, what are you
actually doing here?

1129
01:04:40,628 --> 01:04:41,630
- I'm sorry,

1130
01:04:42,549 --> 01:04:44,260
for the other night.

1131
01:04:45,555 --> 01:04:47,055
If you're gonna have the baby,

1132
01:04:47,057 --> 01:04:48,895
I'm not gonna force
you to do anything.

1133
01:04:50,607 --> 01:04:54,782
Look, I don't have the answers,
but we'll figure it out.

1134
01:04:56,034 --> 01:04:58,621
We'll get real jobs

1135
01:04:58,623 --> 01:05:00,501
and our own apartment.

1136
01:05:01,670 --> 01:05:03,589
I'll stop the music.

1137
01:05:03,591 --> 01:05:05,970
It's never a good time to
become a parent, right?

1138
01:05:07,766 --> 01:05:11,395
- You don't have to
convince yourself,

1139
01:05:11,397 --> 01:05:12,483
or me.

1140
01:05:15,489 --> 01:05:17,577
I'm not keeping it.

1141
01:05:21,752 --> 01:05:22,671
- You sure?

1142
01:05:23,923 --> 01:05:24,800
- Yeah.

1143
01:05:28,431 --> 01:05:29,975
I know I wanna be a mom.

1144
01:05:29,977 --> 01:05:32,481
Just, not right now.

1145
01:05:33,901 --> 01:05:34,778
- Okay.

1146
01:05:38,493 --> 01:05:41,999
- I guess that's what
being an adult is,

1147
01:05:42,001 --> 01:05:45,673
you know, deciding
what's best for me.

1148
01:05:45,675 --> 01:05:47,929
- Sounds pretty responsible.

1149
01:05:50,142 --> 01:05:54,526
So, who are you and what
have you done with Cherry?

1150
01:05:56,697 --> 01:05:58,826
What are you gonna do now?

1151
01:06:00,203 --> 01:06:02,792
- I have an appointment at 10.

1152
01:06:07,009 --> 01:06:09,721
- Do you, want me to come?

1153
01:06:09,723 --> 01:06:10,808
- Thanks,

1154
01:06:12,687 --> 01:06:14,023
but no, I'm good.

1155
01:06:17,697 --> 01:06:18,574
- So,

1156
01:06:20,912 --> 01:06:22,081
what about us?

1157
01:06:23,668 --> 01:06:26,672
Are we together still, or ?

1158
01:06:26,674 --> 01:06:29,261
- I mean, were we really?

1159
01:06:31,099 --> 01:06:33,059
- I mean, are people just
together to get married

1160
01:06:33,061 --> 01:06:34,564
and have kids?

1161
01:06:35,273 --> 01:06:36,652
- I don't know.

1162
01:06:38,948 --> 01:06:42,244
We definitely have a shit ton
to learn and do first though.

1163
01:06:42,246 --> 01:06:43,831
- You more than me.

1164
01:06:43,833 --> 01:06:46,002
- Debatable.

1165
01:06:46,004 --> 01:06:47,964
Okay.

1166
01:06:47,966 --> 01:06:52,600
I will be over to your place
to pick up my stuff tonight.

1167
01:06:53,978 --> 01:06:54,853
- You can stay as
long as you want.

1168
01:06:54,855 --> 01:06:56,022
I promise.

1169
01:06:56,024 --> 01:06:57,900
- No, I'm good.

1170
01:06:57,902 --> 01:07:01,157
I actually wanna spend
some time with my family.

1171
01:07:01,159 --> 01:07:02,994
- Up to you.

1172
01:07:02,996 --> 01:07:07,087
You dumped me, but I'm
still here for you Cherry.

1173
01:07:09,843 --> 01:07:10,720
- Hey.

1174
01:07:13,016 --> 01:07:16,228
When you're a big shot,
don't forget about me.

1175
01:07:16,230 --> 01:07:17,776
- See you around.

1176
01:07:34,893 --> 01:07:35,770
- Wow.

1177
01:07:37,189 --> 01:07:38,899
For once you're on time.

1178
01:07:38,901 --> 01:07:40,278
- Shocker, I know.

1179
01:07:41,907 --> 01:07:44,953
- Let me guess, you
want your job back?

1180
01:07:44,955 --> 01:07:46,372
Well, it's not gonna happen.

1181
01:07:46,374 --> 01:07:49,128
I'm permanently shutting
down everything.

1182
01:07:49,130 --> 01:07:50,090
Downsizing.

1183
01:07:52,679 --> 01:07:55,808
- I actually was hoping
to get my paycheck.

1184
01:07:55,810 --> 01:07:57,185
- Well, it's not ready yet,

1185
01:07:57,187 --> 01:07:58,312
next week.

1186
01:07:58,314 --> 01:08:00,068
- Yeah, I know. It's just,

1187
01:08:01,154 --> 01:08:03,782
I kind of need the money asap,

1188
01:08:03,784 --> 01:08:06,372
if possible in cash.

1189
01:08:09,461 --> 01:08:12,465
- I found this in the
alley, on the ground.

1190
01:08:12,467 --> 01:08:13,804
Look familiar?

1191
01:08:17,979 --> 01:08:21,985
- Yes, I think I
recognize this magic wand.

1192
01:08:21,987 --> 01:08:24,866
- I'm sorry, I
didn't believe you.

1193
01:08:24,868 --> 01:08:25,870
- It's okay.

1194
01:08:27,289 --> 01:08:29,333
It actually doesn't
even matter anymore.

1195
01:08:29,335 --> 01:08:31,506
- So, what are you gonna do?

1196
01:08:33,051 --> 01:08:36,265
- Get back on track
if it's not too late.

1197
01:08:37,184 --> 01:08:39,102
- Wait,

1198
01:08:39,104 --> 01:08:40,230
you're not gonna go to work
for the online competition,

1199
01:08:40,232 --> 01:08:41,315
are you?

1200
01:08:41,317 --> 01:08:42,779
- I would never.

1201
01:08:44,198 --> 01:08:45,908
So, about the cash

1202
01:08:45,910 --> 01:08:47,452
- Oh, just one minute.

1203
01:08:47,454 --> 01:08:48,456
I'll get it.

1204
01:09:33,087 --> 01:09:34,089
Here you go.

1205
01:09:35,300 --> 01:09:36,300
- Thank you.
- Be careful with that.

1206
01:09:36,302 --> 01:09:37,553
- I will.

1207
01:09:37,555 --> 01:09:40,099
- Put it to good use.

1208
01:09:40,101 --> 01:09:41,103
- Thank you.

1209
01:09:43,525 --> 01:09:45,946
- I'm gonna miss you Missy.

1210
01:09:48,117 --> 01:09:50,163
- I'm gonna miss you too.

1211
01:09:53,169 --> 01:09:56,131
I'm gonna miss this store.

1212
01:09:56,133 --> 01:09:57,300
- Yeah.

1213
01:09:57,302 --> 01:09:58,639
I'll miss it too.

1214
01:10:01,394 --> 01:10:02,270
- Thanks.

1215
01:10:03,607 --> 01:10:05,526
- Oh, take the
balloons with you.

1216
01:10:05,528 --> 01:10:08,114
I'm shutting down the stand too.

1217
01:10:08,116 --> 01:10:09,491
Take the stand, take it all!

1218
01:10:09,493 --> 01:10:10,495
- I'm on it.

1219
01:10:57,297 --> 01:10:58,673
- You,

1220
01:10:58,675 --> 01:11:01,428
look like you could
use a balloon.

1221
01:11:01,430 --> 01:11:02,307
- Thanks.

1222
01:11:11,075 --> 01:11:14,830
- Oh wait, you guys
definitely need a balloon.

1223
01:11:14,832 --> 01:11:15,707
That's so cute.

1224
01:11:15,709 --> 01:11:16,545
