1
00:01:41,648 --> 00:01:42,614
We're here.

2
00:01:42,649 --> 00:01:43,547
We're here.

3
00:01:43,650 --> 00:01:46,517
We are here.

4
00:01:46,620 --> 00:01:48,679
I can't believe we at Three-Tizzle.

5
00:01:48,789 --> 00:01:51,280
The hottest shop in La Lizzle.

6
00:01:51,391 --> 00:01:53,291
English, son.
Remember, we're in America.

7
00:01:56,496 --> 00:01:59,954
- Son, your Uncle Mack is gonna trip.
- Phew! Oh!

8
00:02:00,066 --> 00:02:02,159
Man, when I first left Caruthersville...

9
00:02:02,269 --> 00:02:04,794
- all I had was a $50 Grimley and a Jheri curl.
- Oh!

10
00:02:04,938 --> 00:02:08,203
- Look at me now. Pushin' a fully loaded...
- Oh!

11
00:02:08,308 --> 00:02:10,242
Brand-new Lincoln Navigator.

12
00:02:10,343 --> 00:02:12,243
Come on, Dad.
Compared to these trucks...

13
00:02:12,345 --> 00:02:14,711
- yours is wack.
- What?

14
00:02:14,815 --> 00:02:17,682
- I'm just sayin'. Don't get all mad at me.
- Come on.

15
00:02:17,784 --> 00:02:19,752
I mean, these are
nice cars out here.

16
00:02:19,853 --> 00:02:23,789
You got your Ferrari, your Lotus,
but it's no Lincoln. That's what I'm saying.

17
00:02:23,890 --> 00:02:25,824
Hello, man.
Welcome to 310 Motoring.

18
00:02:25,926 --> 00:02:29,293
- How may I help ya?
- I'm NateJohnson. Is my truck ready?

19
00:02:29,396 --> 00:02:31,956
Oh, Nate. Yes, it is, man.

20
00:02:32,065 --> 00:02:34,966
You're the insurance guy.
I remember your truck.

21
00:02:37,003 --> 00:02:39,665
Oh, snap! Hey.
Yo, that's Kurupt.

22
00:02:39,806 --> 00:02:42,468
I sent him my demo tape,
like, two weeks ago.

23
00:02:42,609 --> 00:02:45,169
Just act like you're my bodyguard.
Look.

24
00:02:45,312 --> 00:02:47,212
- Hey, and if he come over...
- What?

25
00:02:47,314 --> 00:02:50,044
Just call me M.C. "D" to theJizz-A.

26
00:02:50,150 --> 00:02:52,778
- Yeah, Dad.
- Call you who to the Wizz-A?

27
00:02:52,886 --> 00:02:54,945
I named you Divernius James...

28
00:02:55,055 --> 00:02:56,955
After your granddaddy.

29
00:02:57,057 --> 00:02:59,048
Plus that street name stuff
isn't marketable.

30
00:02:59,159 --> 00:03:01,525
This rap thing, son,
there's no future in it.

31
00:03:01,628 --> 00:03:03,619
There's no pension,
no 401 plan...

32
00:03:03,730 --> 00:03:05,664
and obviously no dental.

33
00:03:05,765 --> 00:03:07,733
That's why they all have
those gold teeth.

34
00:03:10,504 --> 00:03:13,064
Oh!

35
00:03:13,206 --> 00:03:15,800
Dad, come on.
Dad, come on.!

36
00:03:17,477 --> 00:03:21,345
That's what I call a fully loaded 'Gator
for the haters.

37
00:03:21,448 --> 00:03:23,780
The platinum grille,
Burberry interior.

38
00:03:26,019 --> 00:03:29,853
Hydraulic switches, three-wheel motion,
and look at the wheels.

39
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,759
Oh, boy.

40
00:03:34,861 --> 00:03:37,989
Son, all that Crenshaw crap
kills the resale.

41
00:03:38,098 --> 00:03:41,295
Now, what self-respecting lawyer or doctor
would drive this thing now?

42
00:03:42,769 --> 00:03:45,738
- Dr. Dre.
- Boy, he ain't no real doctor.

43
00:03:45,839 --> 00:03:47,739
Come here now.
Look, son.

44
00:03:47,841 --> 00:03:49,741
My car will be your car in...

45
00:03:49,843 --> 00:03:51,743
three, four or five, six...

46
00:03:51,845 --> 00:03:53,779
seven, eight, nine, 1 0 years...

47
00:03:53,880 --> 00:03:56,678
and I don't want you thuggin' it up.

48
00:03:56,783 --> 00:03:59,411
But, Dad, then why are we here?

49
00:04:01,454 --> 00:04:03,922
We're here to install my Delco
eight-track tape player...

50
00:04:04,024 --> 00:04:06,117
so I can listen to my music
on the trip.

51
00:04:06,226 --> 00:04:09,127
Listen, if you wanted
to go old-school...

52
00:04:09,229 --> 00:04:11,356
you should have had them
install your record player.

53
00:04:11,464 --> 00:04:14,433
Boy, you know, those videos
got your head all mixed up.

54
00:04:14,534 --> 00:04:16,729
- Now, back in my day...
- Yeah, right.

55
00:04:16,836 --> 00:04:20,704
You couldn't have just two hit songs
and call yourself having a good record.

56
00:04:20,807 --> 00:04:24,504
No, no, no. The whole album had to be good.
You just put it on, let it play.

57
00:04:24,611 --> 00:04:27,375
Wasn't no skip buttons.
Wasn't like that mess you listen to today.

58
00:04:27,480 --> 00:04:30,847
All that "rub me"
and "lick me" and "suck me. "

59
00:04:30,951 --> 00:04:33,977
Gotta wear a condom just
to listen to some of it.

60
00:04:36,990 --> 00:04:39,652
Oh. Oh. No, no, no, no.

61
00:04:39,759 --> 00:04:42,853
- Tell me this is not my truck.
- It is, insurance man. Beautiful, isn't it?

62
00:04:42,963 --> 00:04:46,922
This truck has everything.
It has TVs in the floors and the headrest...

63
00:04:47,033 --> 00:04:52,938
a Nike air bag, even new 26-inch rims
just approved for public use.

64
00:04:53,039 --> 00:04:57,169
Not by me. The only thing I approved
was an eight-track.

65
00:04:57,277 --> 00:05:00,440
Now, where is it?

66
00:05:00,547 --> 00:05:04,244
Oh, the Delco.
It must have been a mix-up...

67
00:05:04,351 --> 00:05:06,819
uh, made by my brother
who we fired yesterday.

68
00:05:06,920 --> 00:05:09,684
Well, imagine that, Ziggy Marley.

69
00:05:09,789 --> 00:05:12,519
Now, I suggest you get
that junk off my truck right now...

70
00:05:12,626 --> 00:05:15,220
before I flip you upside-down
and mop the floor with ya!

71
00:05:15,328 --> 00:05:18,525
Wait, don't. Shh, shh.
Don't be so violent.

72
00:05:18,632 --> 00:05:22,500
Calm down.
I can't just take it off.

73
00:05:22,602 --> 00:05:24,593
It's... It's gonna take about...

74
00:05:25,872 --> 00:05:28,067
- Three days.
- Uh, no. Three? Three days?

75
00:05:28,208 --> 00:05:30,904
No, no, no, no.
In three days I've gotta be in Missouri...

76
00:05:31,011 --> 00:05:33,673
which means
I'm on the I-10 by 10:00.

77
00:05:33,780 --> 00:05:36,578
But no worries.
Just take it...

78
00:05:36,683 --> 00:05:38,651
and bring it back exactly how it is.

79
00:05:38,752 --> 00:05:40,185
- No charge.
- Whoa.

80
00:05:40,286 --> 00:05:43,915
Better not be no charge to me.
Look, what about my eight-track?

81
00:05:44,024 --> 00:05:46,390
Oh, it has eight-track,
nine-track, 1 0-track.

82
00:05:46,493 --> 00:05:50,554
It's a C.D. Player. Don't worry, boss man.
Your ride will glide.

83
00:05:50,664 --> 00:05:52,325
Yeah!

84
00:05:52,432 --> 00:05:54,332
Dad. Look. Look.

85
00:05:57,737 --> 00:05:59,705
Yeah!

86
00:06:01,775 --> 00:06:03,640
Up, up. Down.

87
00:06:03,743 --> 00:06:06,337
Yeah!

88
00:06:09,182 --> 00:06:12,083
Real smooth!

89
00:06:12,185 --> 00:06:13,880
Oh!

90
00:06:13,987 --> 00:06:17,514
This don't make no sense.
D.J., how do you turn this thing off?

91
00:06:17,624 --> 00:06:20,354
Everybody's lookin' at us.
What's up, baby?

92
00:06:20,460 --> 00:06:23,156
Hey, this is hot, huh?

93
00:06:25,932 --> 00:06:27,695
No, no, no.

94
00:06:27,801 --> 00:06:30,235
Yo, Dad, look.

95
00:06:30,370 --> 00:06:34,136
31 0 dropped the navigation in the car.
Look.

96
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,208
It's goin' up, up.

97
00:06:36,309 --> 00:06:38,209
But here's the fun part.

98
00:06:38,311 --> 00:06:40,871
Los Angeles to...

99
00:06:40,980 --> 00:06:43,505
Caruthersville, Missouri.

100
00:06:43,616 --> 00:06:46,050
Los Angeles to Caruthersville.

101
00:06:46,152 --> 00:06:49,280
Distance: 1,888.9 miles.

102
00:06:49,389 --> 00:06:53,223
That's all I need is another woman
telling me what to do.

103
00:06:53,393 --> 00:06:55,861
Ooh, girl, you wanna know
my perfect outfit?

104
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:59,989
I'm thinking J. Lo's jeans. You know
the ones she had at the MTVAwards.

105
00:07:00,100 --> 00:07:03,934
No, no, no. But Eve's top at the A.M.A.'s,
that was hot. I would rock that.

106
00:07:05,238 --> 00:07:06,933
Open the door.

107
00:07:07,073 --> 00:07:08,973
Tried that.

108
00:07:09,075 --> 00:07:11,270
Here. Use this.

109
00:07:11,377 --> 00:07:14,346
Hold on.

110
00:07:15,381 --> 00:07:18,612
- Hello.
- Nikki, open the door.

111
00:07:24,390 --> 00:07:27,450
Nikki, let your sister
get her dog stuff.

112
00:07:29,996 --> 00:07:32,055
Okay.

113
00:07:32,165 --> 00:07:34,065
Hmm.

114
00:07:34,167 --> 00:07:37,466
Your father was supposed to be here
1 0 minutes ago, so get off the phone...

115
00:07:37,604 --> 00:07:41,131
finish packing
and change that outfit.

116
00:07:41,274 --> 00:07:44,209
Ah! Don't you answer that phone.

117
00:07:44,310 --> 00:07:46,210
Whoever it is can call
when you get back.

118
00:07:46,312 --> 00:07:48,678
- Okay.
- Mm-hmm.

119
00:07:58,792 --> 00:08:01,727
- Did you see that?
- Yeah.

120
00:08:01,828 --> 00:08:04,194
- Dad, did you see that?
- Yeah, I saw that.

121
00:08:04,297 --> 00:08:06,595
Oh, shoot.

122
00:08:08,735 --> 00:08:11,295
Boy, give me the phone.
Phone ain't for you.

123
00:08:11,437 --> 00:08:13,462
Upstairs, D.J.
Hello.

124
00:08:13,606 --> 00:08:16,040
Hey, Mama. No.

125
00:08:16,142 --> 00:08:19,168
- I told you. We'll be there in three days.
- I'm surprised.

126
00:08:19,312 --> 00:08:21,974
'Cause Miss Uppity
makes you back out every year.

127
00:08:22,081 --> 00:08:24,481
I don't know why
that woman doesn't like me.

128
00:08:24,584 --> 00:08:28,384
Come on, Mama.
You did throw cooked rice at our weddin'.

129
00:08:29,522 --> 00:08:31,490
Is that woman even coming?

130
00:08:31,591 --> 00:08:35,493
Yeah. She is, uh,
packing right now.

131
00:08:35,595 --> 00:08:37,495
Hold on, son.

132
00:08:37,597 --> 00:08:40,498
Your brother Mack just got here
with one of those flat-screen TVs.

133
00:08:40,600 --> 00:08:43,569
- Hey, Mama.
- You're always thinkin' about your mama.

134
00:08:43,703 --> 00:08:47,139
- All the time, girl.
- Set it right there between J.F.K. And Jesus.

135
00:08:47,273 --> 00:08:50,140
Hello.
Mack got you a plasma TV?

136
00:08:50,243 --> 00:08:53,770
I don't know. Is that what you call it?
Here. Talk to your brother.

137
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:57,338
All right. Hey, little bro.
What's goin' on?

138
00:08:57,450 --> 00:09:01,284
Hey, man. What happened
to the 3 5-inch I just sent Mama?

139
00:09:01,387 --> 00:09:05,221
Ah, don't worry about it.
She, uh... She usin' it.

140
00:09:05,325 --> 00:09:07,350
You ain't plannin'
on comin' down here...

141
00:09:07,460 --> 00:09:09,860
and winning my Family of the Year trophy,
are you?

142
00:09:09,963 --> 00:09:11,988
Man, what trophy?

143
00:09:12,098 --> 00:09:14,032
Don't know anything
about no trophy.

144
00:09:14,133 --> 00:09:17,796
I'm just trying to bring my fam down there
so we can see Mama. That's it.

145
00:09:17,937 --> 00:09:20,770
Well, well, that's real
thoughtful of you, baby bro...

146
00:09:20,874 --> 00:09:23,274
seein' as how you ain't
been here in four years.

147
00:09:23,376 --> 00:09:25,970
What you tryin' to say, Mack?
Tryin' to start somethin'?

148
00:09:26,079 --> 00:09:28,343
No, no, no.
I ain't tryin' to start nothin'.

149
00:09:28,448 --> 00:09:30,609
It's just that you ain't
been here in so long...

150
00:09:30,717 --> 00:09:33,584
kind of make me think
you're tryin' to hide somethin'.

151
00:09:33,686 --> 00:09:35,586
You do remember the rules,
don't you?

152
00:09:35,688 --> 00:09:38,953
- You can't win Family of the Year
if you ain't a family.

153
00:09:39,058 --> 00:09:42,255
- I know.
- So, I strongly suggest...

154
00:09:42,362 --> 00:09:44,523
if you want to win yourself
a trophy or somethin'...

155
00:09:44,631 --> 00:09:47,429
you ought to start coaching yourself
a Little League team.

156
00:09:49,702 --> 00:09:51,693
My little brother Nate.
Uh-huh.

157
00:09:51,838 --> 00:09:53,772
Hey, Mama.

158
00:09:53,873 --> 00:09:56,774
Hey, look.
I know he didn't hang up.

159
00:09:56,876 --> 00:09:59,174
Hello? All right.
All right.

160
00:10:05,051 --> 00:10:07,178
Yo, Dad.

161
00:10:07,287 --> 00:10:10,415
Look, um, I'm really tired,
going back and forth.

162
00:10:10,523 --> 00:10:14,687
I mean, we gotta go
all the way over there...

163
00:10:14,794 --> 00:10:16,785
and then we gotta go
all the way over here.

164
00:10:16,896 --> 00:10:20,354
- And then we gotta go all the way...
- All right. I get it.

165
00:10:20,466 --> 00:10:23,663
Look, things are gonna be okay.

166
00:10:23,770 --> 00:10:26,739
If they weren't, we wouldn't be
goin' on this trip together.

167
00:10:26,839 --> 00:10:29,808
Your mother and I
are gonna work things out.

168
00:10:29,943 --> 00:10:32,537
- Don't worry. Okay?
- All right. Cool.

169
00:10:32,645 --> 00:10:34,943
All right, buckle up.

170
00:10:35,048 --> 00:10:38,074
Lock your door.
Close your vent.

171
00:10:38,184 --> 00:10:40,243
- Yeah, Dad. All right.
- Don't touch the radio.

172
00:10:40,353 --> 00:10:43,481
- I said don't touch the radio.
- My bad.

173
00:10:48,795 --> 00:10:53,198
Dorothy, Nikki, let's go!

174
00:10:55,735 --> 00:10:58,568
Son, you wanna learn how to drive?

175
00:10:58,705 --> 00:11:01,333
- For sure. Let's go.
- Give me your hand. Here's your first lesson.

176
00:11:01,474 --> 00:11:04,705
Let's go!

177
00:11:04,811 --> 00:11:07,837
Calm down, Nate. We'll be out in a minute.

178
00:11:07,947 --> 00:11:09,915
Let's go.

179
00:11:11,751 --> 00:11:13,912
Oh, no.
Don't even think about it.

180
00:11:14,020 --> 00:11:16,488
Dang, Dad.

181
00:11:16,589 --> 00:11:21,390
Man, what would I do
without my Mike Tyson grill?

182
00:11:21,494 --> 00:11:24,725
"Tastes so good, it'll bite you back. "

183
00:11:24,831 --> 00:11:27,026
- Let me go get these women.
- Yeah, do that.

184
00:11:33,039 --> 00:11:37,476
Ladies, come on. Let's go.
We gotta be on the I-10 by 10:00.

185
00:11:37,577 --> 00:11:40,068
And it's 9:42. Let's roll.

186
00:11:42,048 --> 00:11:44,642
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.

187
00:11:44,751 --> 00:11:47,777
Don't tell me you are bringing
your schoolwork on this trip.

188
00:11:47,887 --> 00:11:50,151
Yes. I have a test
when I get back.

189
00:11:50,256 --> 00:11:54,056
- Why don't you study when we get back?
- Help me with the bags, please.

190
00:11:55,395 --> 00:11:58,592
D.J., help your mother
with her bags.

191
00:11:58,698 --> 00:12:00,996
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
- What?

192
00:12:01,100 --> 00:12:03,000
You're runnin' like
you stole something. Say hello.

193
00:12:03,102 --> 00:12:05,832
- Hello, sweetie.
- Hey, Ma.

194
00:12:05,972 --> 00:12:09,135
You mean you gotta do this...

195
00:12:09,275 --> 00:12:11,300
Yeah, you're right.

196
00:12:11,444 --> 00:12:14,971
My belly button is way better
than Beyoncê's.

197
00:12:16,315 --> 00:12:19,216
What? Now, see,
you've gone a little far now.

198
00:12:19,318 --> 00:12:21,411
I ain't puttin'
chocolate syrup in it.

199
00:12:21,521 --> 00:12:23,250
- No.
- Get off that phone and change.

200
00:12:23,356 --> 00:12:25,256
- Thank you.
- That was the quarterback.

201
00:12:25,358 --> 00:12:27,986
You're living under my roof,
play by my rules.

202
00:12:28,094 --> 00:12:30,892
- No boys on the phone.
- You're acting like Dad.

203
00:12:30,997 --> 00:12:33,591
- No boys stopping by all hours. Don't roll your eyes.
- He's a quarterback.

204
00:12:33,699 --> 00:12:36,600
- That's right.
- Cell phone.

205
00:12:36,702 --> 00:12:39,967
I didn't want you to have a cell phone
in the first place. Your father's idea.

206
00:12:41,641 --> 00:12:43,609
Y'all are arguing about
the wrong thing.

207
00:12:43,709 --> 00:12:46,507
Who made the sandwiches for the trip,
and did you go by Food Club...

208
00:12:46,612 --> 00:12:49,308
and get the big thing
of planters Cheez Balls like I like 'em?

209
00:12:49,415 --> 00:12:52,384
Nate, you see what she's wearing?

210
00:12:53,486 --> 00:12:55,477
Actually, both y'all need to change.

211
00:12:55,588 --> 00:12:57,556
You know my mama don't like pink.

212
00:12:57,657 --> 00:13:00,990
Nate. "Cheez Balls. "

213
00:13:01,094 --> 00:13:03,085
Daddy, I made
this outfit myself.

214
00:13:03,196 --> 00:13:05,790
You need to get upstairs
and finish making the rest of it.

215
00:13:05,898 --> 00:13:08,526
- But it took me...
- But nothin'. Nikki, I am your father.

216
00:13:08,634 --> 00:13:11,034
I know what's best for you,
and that's go change.

217
00:13:12,371 --> 00:13:14,464
L-10 by 10:00. Let's go, people.

218
00:13:16,943 --> 00:13:18,968
- Hi, Daddy.
- Hi, cutie.

219
00:13:19,112 --> 00:13:20,943
- And how are you?
- Good. You?

220
00:13:21,047 --> 00:13:23,481
Ah, you look so nice.
You ready for the trip?

221
00:13:23,583 --> 00:13:25,676
Yep.

222
00:13:27,720 --> 00:13:30,211
Nate, what happened to your car?

223
00:13:30,323 --> 00:13:32,018
It looks like a purse on wheels.

224
00:13:32,125 --> 00:13:34,719
Then you should feel right at home.

225
00:13:34,827 --> 00:13:36,920
- Damn.
- Oh, there you go, son.

226
00:13:37,029 --> 00:13:40,863
You know, if that rapping thing doesn't
work out, you'll make one hell of a bellboy.

227
00:13:42,969 --> 00:13:46,427
Go ahead. All right, sweetie.
Let's get you in the car.

228
00:13:48,040 --> 00:13:50,634
All right. Upsy-goesy.

229
00:13:52,478 --> 00:13:54,446
Okay. Better.

230
00:13:56,082 --> 00:13:58,050
All right.
Remember, baby girl.

231
00:13:58,151 --> 00:14:01,814
I have a very special birthday party
planned for you at Bun World.

232
00:14:01,921 --> 00:14:04,446
Yea!

233
00:14:04,557 --> 00:14:07,082
Wait, Daddy.
Don't leave Sir Barks-A-Lot.

234
00:14:07,193 --> 00:14:09,218
He's going to miss my birthday.

235
00:14:09,328 --> 00:14:11,853
Sweetie, there is no dog, okay?

236
00:14:11,964 --> 00:14:14,432
Nate, get the dog.

237
00:14:18,471 --> 00:14:20,962
There.

238
00:14:22,608 --> 00:14:25,076
- There you go.
- Thanks, Dad.

239
00:14:34,787 --> 00:14:36,755
What the hell?

240
00:14:36,856 --> 00:14:40,087
- Nikki, this better be F. T.D.
- Yoo-hoo.

241
00:14:40,193 --> 00:14:42,388
His rusty tail is old enough
to be your granddaddy.

242
00:14:42,495 --> 00:14:44,622
- Or Mom's big daddy.
- Dorothy.

243
00:14:44,730 --> 00:14:47,699
"Yoo-hoo, Dorothy"?

244
00:14:49,835 --> 00:14:54,329
Nikki. Tsk. You didn't tell me Mama's
been creepin' while Daddy's been sleepin'.

245
00:14:54,473 --> 00:14:56,737
I didn't tell you 'cause you a kid.

246
00:14:56,842 --> 00:14:58,742
Tsk. See, there you go.

247
00:14:58,844 --> 00:15:01,244
I'm NateJohnson.
Mm-hmm.

248
00:15:01,347 --> 00:15:04,248
Yeah. We'll use those flowers
for his funeral.

249
00:15:04,350 --> 00:15:06,944
I reserved our favorite table
at Starbucks.

250
00:15:07,053 --> 00:15:09,317
Oh.
Thanks for the book, Stan.

251
00:15:09,422 --> 00:15:11,686
Uh, I really can't
accept the flowers.

252
00:15:11,791 --> 00:15:14,521
Why not? L... I spent
all week picking them.

253
00:15:14,627 --> 00:15:16,595
Well, we're study partners,
Stan. That's it.

254
00:15:16,696 --> 00:15:21,030
- What do you mean?
- I don't want you to get the wrong idea.

255
00:15:21,133 --> 00:15:23,067
What's up, brah?

256
00:15:23,169 --> 00:15:26,104
Hello, brother.
Stan Turner.

257
00:15:26,205 --> 00:15:28,173
NateJohnson...

258
00:15:28,307 --> 00:15:30,400
husband, 1 6 years.

259
00:15:30,543 --> 00:15:33,341
- Nate, don't start.
- I'm just trying to take my family...

260
00:15:33,446 --> 00:15:35,346
down to the reunion.

261
00:15:35,448 --> 00:15:38,679
You know, uh, some spades,
a couple of family arguments...

262
00:15:38,784 --> 00:15:40,274
- some softball.
- Whoa. Yes.

263
00:15:40,386 --> 00:15:43,150
Whoa. Careful there.
Just a little...

264
00:15:43,256 --> 00:15:45,019
Oh!

265
00:15:45,124 --> 00:15:47,319
What is wrong with you?

266
00:15:47,426 --> 00:15:49,621
Stan, wait.

267
00:15:49,729 --> 00:15:51,321
"Stan, wait"?

268
00:15:51,430 --> 00:15:54,763
I didn't get the memo. When did
we start seeing other people, Dorothy?

269
00:15:54,867 --> 00:15:58,325
Don't test me. You know the only reason
I agreed to go on this trip...

270
00:15:58,437 --> 00:16:00,871
is 'cause it's
Destiny's birthday tomorrow.

271
00:16:01,007 --> 00:16:03,771
Fine. Fine. Fine.

272
00:16:03,876 --> 00:16:06,902
I'm NateJohnson.
Capricorn.

273
00:16:07,046 --> 00:16:09,139
Check my dental records, jack.

274
00:16:16,489 --> 00:16:22,018
So, where did you meet him...
that so-called accounting class?

275
00:16:22,128 --> 00:16:25,154
So that's what this is all about, huh?
Me becoming a C.p. A.

276
00:16:25,264 --> 00:16:28,097
I thought we settled that argument
when I moved out.

277
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:30,930
Oh, so I'm the bad guy
because I wanted you...

278
00:16:31,070 --> 00:16:33,265
- to raise our kids?
- I can be a wife...

279
00:16:33,406 --> 00:16:36,034
a mother and pursue my career too.

280
00:16:36,175 --> 00:16:39,611
- Hey, my mother did it.
- Right. Yeah.

281
00:16:39,712 --> 00:16:42,875
That's why the last time
I saw your brother, he was your sister.

282
00:16:46,819 --> 00:16:48,548
Mommy, I'm hungry.

283
00:16:48,654 --> 00:16:52,055
Hey, um, Nikki, can you get your sister
some Froot Loops, please?

284
00:16:52,158 --> 00:16:55,150
Shut up.

285
00:16:55,261 --> 00:16:57,024
Destiny, sweetie.

286
00:16:57,129 --> 00:17:00,860
Be very careful
in Daddy's new truck.

287
00:17:00,966 --> 00:17:05,027
Look. Everybody else, this truck
has to go back exactly the way it is.

288
00:17:05,171 --> 00:17:07,833
If you break something,
then I've gotta pay for it.

289
00:17:09,775 --> 00:17:12,903
Oops. Sorry, Dad.

290
00:17:13,012 --> 00:17:16,971
Th-That's okay, sweetie.
Don't worry about it.

291
00:17:21,320 --> 00:17:26,383
All right.
The I-10 by... 10:03.

292
00:17:26,492 --> 00:17:28,392
Damn. We're late.

293
00:18:16,575 --> 00:18:19,066
Yo, Dad. Who was that?

294
00:18:19,211 --> 00:18:23,079
- It's S.O.S., son.
- I wish somebody can come rescue me right now.

295
00:18:23,182 --> 00:18:27,744
Oh, Nate, be fair. Why don't you just
load half of your C.D.'s and half of his?

296
00:18:27,853 --> 00:18:31,414
I'll load half of his C.D.'s
when he pays half of my car note.

297
00:18:31,524 --> 00:18:33,048
Nate.

298
00:18:34,326 --> 00:18:37,489
Fine. But I like
my music nonviolent...

299
00:18:37,596 --> 00:18:39,587
with limited cussin;

300
00:18:39,698 --> 00:18:41,928
So, nobody who's been shot.

301
00:18:42,034 --> 00:18:44,502
Here. Come here.
Give me this.

302
00:18:44,637 --> 00:18:47,731
Okay. Right here.
Tupac Shakur. Shot.

303
00:18:49,909 --> 00:18:51,809
Nate. Nate, what...

304
00:18:51,911 --> 00:18:53,902
Notorious B.I.G. Shot.

305
00:18:54,046 --> 00:18:56,844
- Hey, Dad. What are you doin'? Mom.
- C-Murder.

306
00:18:56,949 --> 00:18:58,974
Wait. Stop.

307
00:18:59,084 --> 00:19:02,781
- Dad, C-Murder wasn't shot. - Yeah, but
with a name like that, he should have been.

308
00:19:15,434 --> 00:19:18,733
- Sam Cooke.
- Wait. What are you doing?

309
00:19:18,871 --> 00:19:20,839
Shot.

310
00:19:20,940 --> 00:19:23,465
Whoa, whoa, whoa. That's Sam Cooke.
That's "born by the river. "

311
00:19:23,609 --> 00:19:25,509
You gonna make me
pull this car over.

312
00:19:25,611 --> 00:19:26,873
- Marvin Gaye.
- Hey, hey.

313
00:19:26,979 --> 00:19:29,106
Shot.

314
00:19:29,215 --> 00:19:31,206
That is one of the greatest singers...

315
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,552
- He threw out Marvin Gaye.
- He was shot... by his daddy.

316
00:19:35,654 --> 00:19:38,145
- Twice.
- What are you...

317
00:19:39,725 --> 00:19:42,353
- Al Green.
- Wait a minute now. He wasn't shot.

318
00:19:42,461 --> 00:19:45,123
- That was hot grits.
- That was close enough.

319
00:19:45,231 --> 00:19:47,756
- Shot.
- Boy, that man is a reverend.

320
00:19:47,867 --> 00:19:50,233
That's my pastor.
What is wrong with you?

321
00:19:50,336 --> 00:19:52,395
How am I supposed to
go to church on Sunday?

322
00:19:52,538 --> 00:19:54,733
Daddy, no one's been shot on this one.

323
00:20:11,624 --> 00:20:14,115
Daddy, why aren't you singing?

324
00:20:22,801 --> 00:20:24,530
Hey.

325
00:20:24,670 --> 00:20:27,230
Hey, hey.

326
00:20:27,373 --> 00:20:29,739
Hey, Dad.!

327
00:20:29,842 --> 00:20:31,810
Nate, what are you doin'?

328
00:20:31,911 --> 00:20:34,812
Little shortcut.

329
00:20:35,915 --> 00:20:37,507
Yeah.

330
00:20:42,755 --> 00:20:45,155
Oh!

331
00:20:45,791 --> 00:20:48,123
Hey!

332
00:20:52,865 --> 00:20:55,663
See this fool?
What does he...

333
00:20:55,768 --> 00:20:58,100
Come on.

334
00:21:04,777 --> 00:21:08,213
That's it. I'm gon' have to show this redneck
what a brother looks like with a V-8...

335
00:21:08,347 --> 00:21:10,406
riding 300 horses.

336
00:21:12,518 --> 00:21:14,509
That's right.
That's right, baby.

337
00:21:14,620 --> 00:21:17,487
I got the zoom-zoom
for your boom-boom right there.

338
00:21:17,590 --> 00:21:19,524
Yeah.

339
00:21:19,625 --> 00:21:20,592
Ooh, Daddy.

340
00:21:20,693 --> 00:21:23,662
Look at the cute little baby.

341
00:21:25,898 --> 00:21:28,025
Yeah, sucker. Yeah.

342
00:21:28,133 --> 00:21:30,158
Tenderwipe that!

343
00:21:37,343 --> 00:21:39,311
Yeah.

344
00:21:39,445 --> 00:21:42,744
That's drivin' right there.
You know what I'm sayin'?

345
00:21:42,848 --> 00:21:45,146
That's all right right there.

346
00:21:49,521 --> 00:21:51,421
Hey, Dad.
Dad, get the bags.

347
00:21:51,523 --> 00:21:53,218
Everybody all right?
Get the bags!

348
00:21:53,325 --> 00:21:55,225
Get the Cheez Balls.!

349
00:21:56,862 --> 00:21:59,160
Man, them my church shoes.!
Look out.!

350
00:22:00,566 --> 00:22:03,126
Nate, do something. Oh, my God!

351
00:22:03,235 --> 00:22:04,862
Daddy!

352
00:22:06,805 --> 00:22:08,796
Everybody hold on!

353
00:22:17,916 --> 00:22:21,215
- Guess I showed him, huh?
- You sure did.

354
00:22:23,088 --> 00:22:25,682
My God.

355
00:22:25,791 --> 00:22:28,589
Uh... Ooh.

356
00:22:28,694 --> 00:22:31,754
Ooh. Ooh.

357
00:22:31,864 --> 00:22:35,425
Boy, that was close.
Anybody else want to drive?

358
00:22:38,671 --> 00:22:40,866
You are now entering Arizona...

359
00:22:41,006 --> 00:22:43,531
the Grand Canyon State.

360
00:22:43,676 --> 00:22:46,110
Seventy. Increasing cloudiness...

361
00:22:46,211 --> 00:22:48,736
and humid with a high of 96.

362
00:22:48,847 --> 00:22:53,307
With the winds out of the east
at 1 4 miles per hour, it's currently...

363
00:22:53,419 --> 00:22:56,149
Nate, the kids are tired.
It's been a long day.

364
00:22:56,255 --> 00:22:58,416
Let's just start fresh tomorrow.

365
00:22:58,524 --> 00:23:02,722
Oh, I guess watching me drive
wore you guys out, huh?

366
00:23:04,363 --> 00:23:07,025
We're not scheduled to stop
until Boulder City.

367
00:23:07,132 --> 00:23:09,327
I don't plan on stopping
till we get there.

368
00:23:09,435 --> 00:23:11,835
Oh, that's a shame.

369
00:23:11,970 --> 00:23:14,598
'Cause there's nothing
that I wouldn't do for a...

370
00:23:14,740 --> 00:23:18,232
nice, hot... bath.

371
00:23:27,219 --> 00:23:29,779
Anything?

372
00:23:29,888 --> 00:23:31,856
Anything.

373
00:23:54,880 --> 00:23:57,041
All right.

374
00:23:57,149 --> 00:23:58,639
Dang, Dad.

375
00:23:58,751 --> 00:24:00,912
Here we go.

376
00:24:01,019 --> 00:24:02,953
Okay.

377
00:24:04,289 --> 00:24:06,655
Okay, you guys wait right here.
I'll get the rooms.

378
00:24:16,235 --> 00:24:19,568
- Welcome. And here are your keys.
- Thank you.

379
00:24:19,705 --> 00:24:22,469
You know, I'm planning
a special evening tonight.

380
00:24:22,608 --> 00:24:27,705
Do you have any roses, some champagne,
box of fine chocolates?

381
00:24:27,813 --> 00:24:29,713
- No.
- Oh.

382
00:24:29,815 --> 00:24:31,976
I'll take a couple of those
chocolate Easter bunnies.

383
00:24:32,084 --> 00:24:35,952
Let me get the, uh...
the diet champagne?

384
00:24:37,322 --> 00:24:39,483
And, uh, all the candles
that you have.

385
00:24:39,591 --> 00:24:42,651
- We don't carry candles.
- Okay, well, is that... Yeah.

386
00:24:42,761 --> 00:24:45,662
- Give me a road flare.
- That's for emergency use only.

387
00:24:45,764 --> 00:24:47,493
This is an emergency.

388
00:24:50,435 --> 00:24:52,801
Does your wife...

389
00:24:52,938 --> 00:24:55,566
know what you're up to?

390
00:24:55,707 --> 00:24:57,504
Well, actually, no.
She doesn't.

391
00:24:57,609 --> 00:25:00,976
I'm keeping this
a little bit a secret from her.

392
00:25:01,113 --> 00:25:03,980
Oh, yes. I bet. I bet you are.

393
00:25:04,082 --> 00:25:06,949
- No, no.
- Listen, player.

394
00:25:07,052 --> 00:25:10,215
I don't know what kind of
twisted affair you're having...

395
00:25:10,322 --> 00:25:12,290
but it's not gonna happen
in my hotel.

396
00:25:12,391 --> 00:25:14,689
Oh, no. Whoa.
Whoa, whoa, whoa. Please.

397
00:25:14,793 --> 00:25:19,730
Look. I have a surprise evening
planned for my lovely wife.

398
00:25:19,832 --> 00:25:23,029
She's right outside
in the car with the kids.

399
00:25:23,135 --> 00:25:26,434
I mean, that's why I got
the two rooms.

400
00:25:28,574 --> 00:25:31,941
That's the sweetest thing
I've heard in years.

401
00:25:32,044 --> 00:25:34,740
Oh.

402
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,974
And take all your goodies.

403
00:25:37,082 --> 00:25:40,745
- Free of charge. On me.
- Gladys, you don't have to do that. Thank you.

404
00:25:40,853 --> 00:25:42,753
Oh, please.

405
00:25:42,855 --> 00:25:45,483
Husbands like you give me hope.

406
00:25:45,591 --> 00:25:48,185
You got a brother?

407
00:25:49,294 --> 00:25:51,228
Uncle?

408
00:25:51,330 --> 00:25:55,357
- How old's your son?
- Glad... Gladys?

409
00:25:55,467 --> 00:25:58,561
- You're cutting off my circulation.
- Oh. Sorry.

410
00:26:01,106 --> 00:26:04,837
Hey.
Your room isn't ready yet...

411
00:26:04,943 --> 00:26:06,968
but I'm gon' check on it.

412
00:26:07,112 --> 00:26:12,311
Meanwhile, why don't you
get the kids settled in...

413
00:26:12,417 --> 00:26:14,885
and I'll see you in a second.

414
00:26:23,395 --> 00:26:26,592
Oh, yeah.

415
00:27:41,106 --> 00:27:43,370
- Swimming trunks, please.
- Oh.

416
00:27:50,082 --> 00:27:52,710
- Charge it to the room. Thank you.
- You got it.

417
00:27:53,819 --> 00:27:56,549
Ooh, yes, he does.
Wow.

418
00:28:07,899 --> 00:28:10,493
- Nate, what are you doing?
- I just, um...

419
00:28:10,602 --> 00:28:15,005
brought you a little something
to help you relax.

420
00:28:15,107 --> 00:28:18,304
That's what I'm talkin' about
right there.

421
00:28:18,410 --> 00:28:21,345
Some bubbles
with the bubbles.

422
00:28:21,446 --> 00:28:24,347
Mmm.

423
00:28:24,449 --> 00:28:26,679
Plus, uh, some chocolates.

424
00:28:26,785 --> 00:28:30,380
Shh, shh.

425
00:28:30,489 --> 00:28:32,684
Gonna get in there with you, girl.

426
00:28:32,791 --> 00:28:35,453
Mm-hmm.

427
00:28:37,529 --> 00:28:40,020
Oh! Oh.

428
00:28:42,300 --> 00:28:44,268
That's all right there.

429
00:28:44,369 --> 00:28:46,667
Good. Aah.

430
00:28:46,805 --> 00:28:49,035
That's a...
Whoo.

431
00:28:49,174 --> 00:28:52,200
What, you in there
cookin' neck bones, girl?

432
00:28:52,344 --> 00:28:54,312
Ee-yah!

433
00:28:55,847 --> 00:28:59,476
Ooh!

434
00:29:00,285 --> 00:29:03,254
Aah! Gee.

435
00:29:03,355 --> 00:29:05,585
Gonna fool around
and make some coffee in here.

436
00:29:05,690 --> 00:29:07,658
All right. That is...

437
00:29:07,759 --> 00:29:09,522
That is... That's warm.

438
00:29:09,628 --> 00:29:11,596
Oh, man.

439
00:29:14,633 --> 00:29:17,033
Yeah. You know, uh...

440
00:29:17,135 --> 00:29:20,104
it's been a long time
since I've been in ourJacuzzi.

441
00:29:22,340 --> 00:29:24,808
I was thinking...

442
00:29:24,943 --> 00:29:27,377
maybe we can do that thing...

443
00:29:27,479 --> 00:29:30,971
we used to do in ourJacuzzi.

444
00:29:31,083 --> 00:29:34,541
Nate, I am not
getting my hair wet.

445
00:29:34,653 --> 00:29:36,621
Besides, we haven't
solved anything.

446
00:29:36,721 --> 00:29:40,452
Well, um, we could
solve one thing right now.

447
00:29:41,560 --> 00:29:45,656
Either here...
or back up at the room.

448
00:29:45,764 --> 00:29:47,664
You know, it's been three months.

449
00:29:47,766 --> 00:29:50,098
Yeah, it's been three months.

450
00:29:50,202 --> 00:29:53,137
That's what I'm sayin'.
It's been three months.

451
00:29:53,238 --> 00:29:54,796
Yeah, three months.

452
00:29:54,940 --> 00:29:58,569
Right.
Ninety days. Right?

453
00:30:00,112 --> 00:30:04,048
How about, uh,
we, uh, go up to the roof?

454
00:30:04,149 --> 00:30:06,049
Oh, yeah?

455
00:30:06,151 --> 00:30:10,451
Or better yet, why don't we,
uh, go out to the truck?

456
00:30:10,555 --> 00:30:14,047
Oh, no, baby. Anywhere but the truck.
I got to turn that back in.

457
00:30:14,159 --> 00:30:16,889
Maybe we can, uh, do...

458
00:30:21,566 --> 00:30:24,194
- Really?
- Mm-hmm.

459
00:30:24,302 --> 00:30:25,633
- No.
- Yeah.

460
00:30:25,770 --> 00:30:27,362
- You serious?
- Yeah.

461
00:30:27,506 --> 00:30:29,974
In here? You serious?

462
00:30:30,108 --> 00:30:33,339
We never done that before.
Okay. All right.

463
00:30:33,445 --> 00:30:36,710
Girl, you real... Oh, you're wild.

464
00:30:36,815 --> 00:30:39,409
Going back to your old days.

465
00:30:39,518 --> 00:30:41,179
Hey, hey.

466
00:30:41,286 --> 00:30:44,221
Yeah. All right.
Come on. Your turn.

467
00:30:44,322 --> 00:30:46,381
Um...

468
00:30:46,491 --> 00:30:48,721
you know, I...
I gotta go to the bathroom.

469
00:30:48,827 --> 00:30:50,727
Be right back.

470
00:30:50,829 --> 00:30:52,797
Bathroom.

471
00:30:54,166 --> 00:30:56,532
- Dorothy, you're comin' back, right?
- Uh-huh.

472
00:30:56,635 --> 00:30:58,967
Don'tjust leave me out here
all alone.

473
00:30:59,104 --> 00:31:01,470
Dorothy, come on.
Quit playin'.

474
00:31:03,275 --> 00:31:05,539
- Oh, no.
- Good night, Nate.

475
00:31:05,644 --> 00:31:08,408
Dorothy! All right.

476
00:31:08,513 --> 00:31:11,277
Dorothy, see...
See what you done did.

477
00:31:12,951 --> 00:31:16,114
Come on, Dorothy. Why you...

478
00:31:42,714 --> 00:31:45,114
What the hell?
What's goin' on?

479
00:31:47,752 --> 00:31:50,118
Why y'all all up on me?

480
00:31:58,063 --> 00:32:01,123
Yeah.
Uh-oh.

481
00:32:01,233 --> 00:32:04,566
Uh, ladies,
if y'all see a snake, um...

482
00:32:04,669 --> 00:32:06,762
trust me, he won't bite you.

483
00:32:09,741 --> 00:32:12,574
- Diet champagne.
- Ooh, Easter bunnies.

484
00:32:12,677 --> 00:32:14,008
- My favorite.
- Hey.

485
00:32:18,049 --> 00:32:20,017
What the...

486
00:32:23,521 --> 00:32:26,319
Oh. Nate.

487
00:32:29,794 --> 00:32:31,762
Ohh.

488
00:32:38,336 --> 00:32:40,327
So, Mr. Johnson.

489
00:32:41,906 --> 00:32:45,069
- Which one's your wife?
- Hey, it's not what it looks like.

490
00:32:45,176 --> 00:32:49,112
Well, guess you won't
be needing these.

491
00:32:49,214 --> 00:32:51,205
Oh, no, no.
Come on. I'm gonna need those.

492
00:32:51,316 --> 00:32:53,341
Come on, Gladys.

493
00:32:55,453 --> 00:32:59,116
Well, uh, ladies, um...

494
00:32:59,224 --> 00:33:02,125
I have to go see
a man about a horse.

495
00:33:02,227 --> 00:33:04,320
Gonna get out of here.

496
00:33:04,429 --> 00:33:06,829
- Y'all have a pleasant evening.
- Uh-huh.

497
00:33:06,931 --> 00:33:08,990
Oh, watch it.
Hey. Oh, come on now.

498
00:33:09,100 --> 00:33:10,795
- We won't peek.
- Hey. Oh. Hey!

499
00:33:10,902 --> 00:33:13,427
Hey. Oh!

500
00:33:14,939 --> 00:33:17,430
I saw your...
Watch your hand. Whoa-ho!

501
00:33:17,575 --> 00:33:20,237
- Bull's-eye. Bull's-eye.
- I'm not like that.

502
00:33:20,345 --> 00:33:23,007
That belong to somebody. Come on.

503
00:33:23,114 --> 00:33:25,708
Don't look. I'm shy.
Don't... Y'all. Come on.

504
00:33:25,817 --> 00:33:29,253
Whoo.! Oh.!

505
00:33:29,354 --> 00:33:31,845
Who does your bikini wax?

506
00:33:36,361 --> 00:33:38,295
Hey, girl, how was your treatment?

507
00:33:38,396 --> 00:33:40,956
Oh, it was wonderful.

508
00:33:42,000 --> 00:33:43,968
Go, go.

509
00:34:02,654 --> 00:34:05,714
There'll be plenty of time
for that tomorrow, okay?

510
00:34:10,128 --> 00:34:12,528
Hey. Tom, Judy.

511
00:34:12,630 --> 00:34:15,326
How you guys doin'?
It's a mighty fine evening.

512
00:34:15,433 --> 00:34:17,799
Why don't you get rid of
the kids and the clothes...

513
00:34:17,902 --> 00:34:20,735
- and we're all playing
butt-naked Uno up in 304. - Daddy.!

514
00:34:31,416 --> 00:34:33,941
Nate.

515
00:34:34,052 --> 00:34:35,986
Yes?

516
00:34:37,722 --> 00:34:39,587
You know what you're doing?

517
00:34:39,691 --> 00:34:41,215
Mm-hmm.

518
00:34:41,326 --> 00:34:44,625
- Well, could you stop?
- Nope.

519
00:34:44,729 --> 00:34:46,856
Why are you taking this out on me?

520
00:34:46,965 --> 00:34:48,899
You brought this on yourself.

521
00:34:52,704 --> 00:34:55,605
- Hello.
- Hello, Dorothy.

522
00:34:55,707 --> 00:34:57,971
- Hey, you.
- I miss you. Where are you?

523
00:34:58,076 --> 00:35:01,603
Um, outside of Santa Fe,
New Mexico.

524
00:35:01,713 --> 00:35:03,271
"You"? Who is "you"?

525
00:35:03,381 --> 00:35:06,282
Stan, please. I'm with my family.

526
00:35:06,384 --> 00:35:08,477
Stan.

527
00:35:08,586 --> 00:35:11,077
- Study partner, my...
- Daddy.

528
00:35:11,189 --> 00:35:13,623
What's that big building over there...
right over there?

529
00:35:13,725 --> 00:35:15,625
That's a mall?

530
00:35:15,727 --> 00:35:18,127
It's more than a mall, sweetie.
That's Outlet 800.

531
00:35:18,229 --> 00:35:20,629
It's over 800
top designers' wholesale outlets.

532
00:35:20,732 --> 00:35:22,859
I just read about it
in my travel guide here.

533
00:35:22,967 --> 00:35:25,060
Daddy, can we stop
and check it out?

534
00:35:25,203 --> 00:35:28,730
- Oh, no, sweetie. No, no, no.
- Please?

535
00:35:28,873 --> 00:35:31,706
No can do.
We could, uh, lose a whole afternoon...

536
00:35:31,810 --> 00:35:34,938
- in their state-of-the-art day
spa theyjust built. - Day spa?

537
00:35:35,046 --> 00:35:37,708
But you know what?
I got something better planned for us.

538
00:35:37,816 --> 00:35:40,683
We're gonna stop
at Little Tanawanda Village.

539
00:35:40,785 --> 00:35:43,151
Nikki, you remember?
That was your favorite place.

540
00:35:43,254 --> 00:35:45,814
- No, I don't.
- She was two years old.

541
00:35:45,924 --> 00:35:48,290
And I didn't sign up
for some old Indian village...

542
00:35:48,393 --> 00:35:50,884
or to see
the world's largest ball of yarn.

543
00:35:50,995 --> 00:35:54,487
You said "family reunion. " That means
straight to Caruthersville and straight back.

544
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,124
"The I-10 by 10:00."

545
00:35:58,870 --> 00:36:01,964
Oh, yeah. That's funny.
That's funny, Dorothy.

546
00:36:02,106 --> 00:36:04,870
You know what?
This is important, okay?

547
00:36:04,976 --> 00:36:10,881
Now, I didn't tell you this before,
but I'm one-eighth and 3/1 4ths Cherokee.

548
00:36:10,982 --> 00:36:13,212
All right. That's why I got the baby hair.

549
00:36:13,318 --> 00:36:15,377
- Sometimes I have to shave that.
- Baby hair?

550
00:36:15,487 --> 00:36:18,479
- Where's this baby hair?
- Come on. You know that get me started.

551
00:36:32,737 --> 00:36:35,399
Ah, man.
I'm knocked out.

552
00:36:35,540 --> 00:36:37,440
Pardon me.
Excuse me.

553
00:36:37,542 --> 00:36:40,375
Can you tell me
where's Little Tanawanda?

554
00:36:40,478 --> 00:36:42,173
This is Little Tanawanda.

555
00:36:44,816 --> 00:36:47,410
- Dad, I'm hittin' the arcade.
- Okay, son.

556
00:36:47,519 --> 00:36:49,953
You mean to tell me...

557
00:36:50,054 --> 00:36:53,114
That this is Little Tanawanda?

558
00:36:53,224 --> 00:36:55,988
- Yeah.
- Okay. All right.

559
00:36:56,094 --> 00:36:58,289
My man.

560
00:36:58,396 --> 00:37:03,698
Why don't you just lead me to some...
real, old-school Indians...

561
00:37:03,801 --> 00:37:06,998
that are, uh,
still keepin' it real.

562
00:37:08,139 --> 00:37:10,334
Wait, uh, right here.

563
00:37:10,475 --> 00:37:13,000
I think I know someone
who can show you, uh...

564
00:37:13,144 --> 00:37:17,274
- how to get to where the real Indians live.
- Thank you.

565
00:37:19,083 --> 00:37:21,517
Hey, uh, Navarro,
we got a big spender over here...

566
00:37:21,619 --> 00:37:24,281
who wants to know how to
get to where the real Indians live.

567
00:37:24,389 --> 00:37:26,414
Daddy, can we go now?

568
00:37:26,524 --> 00:37:30,016
Just a second, babe. All right?
I got a little something workin' right here.

569
00:37:39,103 --> 00:37:41,003
Daddy, can we go now?

570
00:37:41,105 --> 00:37:43,903
We're about to get some directions
to a real Indian village.

571
00:37:44,008 --> 00:37:48,809
Daddy, I don't care about
no little Indian village. All I wanna do...

572
00:37:48,913 --> 00:37:53,077
Ahh. Take our time
and get those directions.

573
00:37:53,184 --> 00:37:55,152
How.

574
00:37:55,253 --> 00:37:57,983
- My name's Navarro.
- Uh-huh.

575
00:37:58,089 --> 00:38:00,148
I hear you seek
real Indian village.

576
00:38:00,258 --> 00:38:01,885
I think I can help you...

577
00:38:01,993 --> 00:38:04,223
and your daughter.

578
00:38:04,329 --> 00:38:06,297
We are here.

579
00:38:08,299 --> 00:38:09,926
Way at the top.

580
00:38:10,034 --> 00:38:11,899
If you follow
Running Bear River south...

581
00:38:12,003 --> 00:38:14,733
as the sparrow flies...

582
00:38:14,872 --> 00:38:17,306
then take
Walking Buffalo Road east...

583
00:38:17,408 --> 00:38:19,740
- a half moon to the crossing.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

584
00:38:19,844 --> 00:38:23,507
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
That's way too much energy there, Red Bull.

585
00:38:23,615 --> 00:38:25,515
All right? Bring it down.

586
00:38:25,617 --> 00:38:28,916
And then ride bareback
20 horse trots.

587
00:38:29,020 --> 00:38:32,751
I'm in a truck. All right?
A Lincoln Navigator.

588
00:38:32,857 --> 00:38:36,623
Oh. Just take I-53 northeast.

589
00:38:36,728 --> 00:38:38,719
I'm gon' take that service road.

590
00:38:38,830 --> 00:38:40,730
- Beautiful.
- What you say your name was again?

591
00:38:40,832 --> 00:38:42,993
- Navarro.
- Oh, okay. I see.

592
00:38:43,101 --> 00:38:45,296
Okay. Um, in the land
of my ancestors...

593
00:38:45,436 --> 00:38:48,337
some tribes may be, uh,
reluctant to embrace you.

594
00:38:48,439 --> 00:38:51,806
Therefore, I strongly recommend you
wear something that gives you authority.

595
00:38:51,909 --> 00:38:53,843
Oh, yeah.
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

596
00:38:53,945 --> 00:38:55,936
- I remember wearing one of these.
- Yeah.

597
00:38:56,080 --> 00:38:58,048
That's right. I can make it rain.

598
00:38:58,149 --> 00:39:00,049
How about me
giving you my number?

599
00:39:00,151 --> 00:39:01,618
Hi-how-are-ya! Hi-how-are-ya!

600
00:39:01,719 --> 00:39:03,653
I'm going to lunch.

601
00:39:03,755 --> 00:39:06,280
My number in case you get lost.

602
00:39:06,391 --> 00:39:08,291
- All right.
- Hey, hey, hey.

603
00:39:08,393 --> 00:39:10,588
Back off my daughter, man...

604
00:39:10,695 --> 00:39:13,687
before you end up
being called Little Broken Jaw.

605
00:39:13,798 --> 00:39:17,598
- Daddy, what are you doing?
- Come here. What is your problem, huh?

606
00:39:17,702 --> 00:39:21,331
You know what? I am not a little girl
anymore. Those days are way over.

607
00:39:21,472 --> 00:39:24,407
- I can handle myself.
- You can what?

608
00:39:24,509 --> 00:39:27,967
You gonna get handled, you keep talking...
I don't know who you think...

609
00:39:28,112 --> 00:39:31,445
You've been gone three months, and then
you're gonna try and tell me what to do.

610
00:39:31,549 --> 00:39:33,540
- You live up the street, remember?
- Gi...

611
00:39:33,651 --> 00:39:36,882
You're gonna need some allowance money.
That's what you'll remember.

612
00:39:36,988 --> 00:39:38,649
Get in the car.

613
00:39:40,858 --> 00:39:43,691
And you... I... I'll fight
an Indian. All right?

614
00:39:43,795 --> 00:39:45,820
I dance with wolves, okay?

615
00:39:52,503 --> 00:39:55,165
And as for you, little miss pocahontas...

616
00:39:55,306 --> 00:39:58,707
until we get to the reunion,
your little fast tail is grounded.

617
00:39:58,810 --> 00:40:01,779
- You can't ground me in no car.
- I can't ground you? Oh, really?

618
00:40:01,879 --> 00:40:03,779
How about no more TV?

619
00:40:03,881 --> 00:40:05,974
- So? I ain't watchin' no TV.
- Mm-hmm.

620
00:40:06,084 --> 00:40:07,779
No more computer.

621
00:40:09,654 --> 00:40:11,645
- And no more cell phone.
- Daddy.

622
00:40:12,757 --> 00:40:15,089
See? Just like home.

623
00:40:26,704 --> 00:40:30,105
You are now entering Colorado,
the Centennial State.

624
00:40:34,145 --> 00:40:37,706
Look, Daddy.
That lady needs a ride.

625
00:40:42,920 --> 00:40:45,787
Kids, look. Remember,
if I never taught you anything else...

626
00:40:45,890 --> 00:40:47,790
never pick up strangers.

627
00:40:47,892 --> 00:40:50,793
She could have just as well
been a serial killer.

628
00:40:59,670 --> 00:41:01,570
We are in the middle of nowhere.

629
00:41:01,706 --> 00:41:04,231
Tell me you're not about to
pick up a hitchhiker.

630
00:41:04,375 --> 00:41:06,343
Baby, what would Jesus do?

631
00:41:10,114 --> 00:41:12,105
Thanks for picking me up...

632
00:41:12,216 --> 00:41:14,582
and, um, opening the door.

633
00:41:14,685 --> 00:41:16,880
No one does that no more.

634
00:41:16,988 --> 00:41:18,888
You must be a real man.

635
00:41:23,361 --> 00:41:27,058
Uh... I... I'm NateJohnson,
and, uh, that's Nikki.

636
00:41:27,165 --> 00:41:29,395
- Hi.
- That's DJ.

637
00:41:29,500 --> 00:41:31,730
- Hey. What's up?
- And that's little Destiny.

638
00:41:32,937 --> 00:41:35,337
And, uh, this is Dorothy.

639
00:41:35,439 --> 00:41:37,407
She lives down the street.

640
00:41:37,508 --> 00:41:40,341
- Daddy.
- Well, it's true. She does.

641
00:41:40,444 --> 00:41:43,038
- So, what's your name?
- Chrishelle.

642
00:41:43,147 --> 00:41:45,411
Chrishelle Rene Boudreau.

643
00:41:45,516 --> 00:41:47,882
Boudreau.
You hear that?

644
00:41:47,985 --> 00:41:51,011
- Don't we have some Boudreaus down in Shreveport?
- No.

645
00:41:51,122 --> 00:41:54,182
You know, I thought you had
thatJohnson look.

646
00:41:54,292 --> 00:41:57,455
Well, if you're family, you should
ride down to Caruthersville with us.

647
00:41:57,562 --> 00:41:59,120
It's our family reunion.

648
00:41:59,230 --> 00:42:01,824
DJ., you can't give out
that information to strangers.

649
00:42:01,933 --> 00:42:04,561
Uh, no offense, Chrishelle.

650
00:42:04,669 --> 00:42:06,398
I understand.

651
00:42:06,537 --> 00:42:09,233
There are some crazy people
out there.

652
00:42:10,441 --> 00:42:12,409
- Hey, Nikki.
- Yes?

653
00:42:12,510 --> 00:42:15,445
- Take a picture of me and Chrishelle.
- No, no, no.

654
00:42:15,546 --> 00:42:19,676
Uh, some people say if you're
ever caught on film, you lose your soul.

655
00:42:28,526 --> 00:42:30,756
Are we there yet?
I'm starvin'.

656
00:42:30,862 --> 00:42:34,559
No, Daddy,
I'm about to pass out.

657
00:42:34,665 --> 00:42:38,897
Hold on, everyone.
Heaven is just around the corner.

658
00:42:39,036 --> 00:42:40,628
Bun World. One mile.

659
00:42:42,006 --> 00:42:44,702
I want Chuck E. Cheese.

660
00:42:44,842 --> 00:42:46,833
Boy, what are you doing?

661
00:42:46,978 --> 00:42:50,311
Are your braids too tight?
Put that down. You know we say grace.

662
00:42:50,414 --> 00:42:52,746
And since Chrishelle here
is our guest...

663
00:42:52,850 --> 00:42:55,580
I'd like you to bless the food,
if you don't mind.

664
00:42:57,021 --> 00:42:58,989
Sure. All right.

665
00:42:59,090 --> 00:43:01,888
Close your eyes.
God is great, God is...

666
00:43:01,993 --> 00:43:04,018
Daddy, Sir Barks-A-Lot
ran away.

667
00:43:04,128 --> 00:43:07,222
No, baby. No, he didn't.

668
00:43:07,331 --> 00:43:09,424
Come on. Sweetie.

669
00:43:09,533 --> 00:43:12,525
- Okay. All right.
- I love you, Sir Barks-A-Lot.

670
00:43:12,670 --> 00:43:14,797
Have a seat back down.

671
00:43:14,939 --> 00:43:16,566
Honey, you got me.

672
00:43:16,707 --> 00:43:18,607
- Sorry, Daddy.
- I'll get it.

673
00:43:18,709 --> 00:43:21,610
- No, you won't.
- What?

674
00:43:21,712 --> 00:43:24,840
Uh, look, I'm gonna go to the restroom
and, uh, get this off.

675
00:43:24,949 --> 00:43:26,849
Chrishelle,
finish blessing the food.

676
00:43:28,886 --> 00:43:30,786
Can you cover for me?

677
00:43:30,888 --> 00:43:33,652
- Whoops.
- Excuse me. I'm the one who called about the birthday cake.

678
00:43:33,758 --> 00:43:35,692
They're putting
the finishing touches on it now.

679
00:43:35,793 --> 00:43:38,455
- Uh, where is your bathroom?
- Just past the pool table.

680
00:43:41,465 --> 00:43:43,626
God is great,
God is good.

681
00:43:43,734 --> 00:43:46,794
Let us thank him
for our food.

682
00:43:46,938 --> 00:43:49,498
Friends of the night,
please cover us.

683
00:43:49,640 --> 00:43:53,167
Black as a pit.
Deeper than the depths of the abyss.

684
00:43:53,311 --> 00:43:56,337
I call upon
the power of darkness...

685
00:43:56,447 --> 00:44:00,076
to help me cast this unbreakable spell.

686
00:44:00,184 --> 00:44:02,744
Make us all as one.

687
00:44:02,853 --> 00:44:04,980
Chrishelle, Dorothy...

688
00:44:05,089 --> 00:44:08,752
Nikki, Destiny, Nate
and his son.

689
00:44:08,859 --> 00:44:11,623
Amen.

690
00:44:13,664 --> 00:44:15,996
Okay. All righty.
Here we go.

691
00:44:24,442 --> 00:44:26,342
Oh.!

692
00:44:26,444 --> 00:44:31,074
Hey, buddy, you okay in there? 'Cause it
smell like the circus done came to town.

693
00:44:33,951 --> 00:44:37,546
Damn it.

694
00:44:37,655 --> 00:44:40,249
No toilet paper.

695
00:44:40,358 --> 00:44:42,326
Oh, well.

696
00:44:48,132 --> 00:44:50,396
Ahhh. Ah, my cake spatula.

697
00:44:51,802 --> 00:44:53,702
Almost forgot that.

698
00:44:53,838 --> 00:44:55,863
Hey, buddy. You know how
to spell "Destiny"?

699
00:44:56,007 --> 00:44:58,976
Never mind.
I'll figure it out.

700
00:44:59,076 --> 00:45:01,476
Enjoy your lunch.

701
00:45:07,318 --> 00:45:11,015
I know they say the Navigator is supposed
to seat eight people comfortably...

702
00:45:11,122 --> 00:45:14,114
but I don't think they meant
all in the front seat.

703
00:45:39,650 --> 00:45:43,177
Dorothy, okay, I've got us
a couple of rooms here.

704
00:45:43,287 --> 00:45:45,482
One for the guys,
one for the girls.

705
00:45:45,589 --> 00:45:47,386
- Looks like we're roommates.
- Adjoining rooms.

706
00:45:47,491 --> 00:45:49,186
Uh, Nate, sweetie...

707
00:45:49,293 --> 00:45:54,026
why don't we give our guest
a room for herself?

708
00:45:54,131 --> 00:45:57,191
You know how Destiny loves to
snore the paint off the walls.

709
00:45:57,301 --> 00:45:59,895
And, um, you can sleep
with me and the kids.

710
00:46:00,004 --> 00:46:03,735
Oh, yeah. That's funny. Maybe, uh,
we can just meet in the hot tub again.

711
00:46:03,874 --> 00:46:06,843
Uh, I don't mind sharin'.
Snoring doesn't bother me none.

712
00:46:06,977 --> 00:46:08,877
See? Right there.
Chrishelle doesn't mind.

713
00:46:08,979 --> 00:46:12,745
No, Nate. I insist
you sleep with me.

714
00:46:12,850 --> 00:46:16,809
Okay, all right.
The begging is not becoming of you.

715
00:46:17,955 --> 00:46:20,617
Good night.

716
00:46:20,724 --> 00:46:22,919
I'll see y'all tomorrow.

717
00:46:27,264 --> 00:46:29,323
I'll see you in a minute.

718
00:46:29,433 --> 00:46:31,765
- What is goin' on?
- Slackin' on your pimpin', Dad.

719
00:46:32,803 --> 00:46:35,067
You need to ditch her.

720
00:46:35,172 --> 00:46:38,369
Let me see those toes.
Are they nice and clean? Yeah?

721
00:46:38,509 --> 00:46:40,568
- Yeah, Mom.
- "Yeah, Mom. "

722
00:46:48,819 --> 00:46:51,117
- St... Stop playin'.
- Will you stop?

723
00:46:54,859 --> 00:46:57,123
- Go back.
- Stop hogging the TV.

724
00:46:57,228 --> 00:46:59,492
Well, why don't you go
talk on your cell phone?

725
00:46:59,597 --> 00:47:02,395
Oh. Oh. I forgot.
You grounded.

726
00:47:02,500 --> 00:47:05,230
- I can't stand your ugly butt.
- Capital "G." Oh!

727
00:47:05,336 --> 00:47:07,497
- Why you do that?
- I'm gonna tell Mom and Dad.

728
00:47:07,605 --> 00:47:10,335
- All right. Enough.
- See?

729
00:47:10,474 --> 00:47:13,705
I guess I found the only Chuck E. Cheese
in the whole state.

730
00:47:13,844 --> 00:47:15,937
- Okay. Look.
- I'm the oldest. I'm the oldest.

731
00:47:16,080 --> 00:47:19,049
Settle down. No one eats until
your sister eats. It's her birthday.

732
00:47:19,183 --> 00:47:21,947
- Daddy.
- Okay.

733
00:47:22,052 --> 00:47:24,748
All right.
Here we go.

734
00:47:26,023 --> 00:47:28,457
I hope she enjoys this.

735
00:47:28,559 --> 00:47:31,756
Destiny, Daddy's got
a surprise for you.

736
00:47:55,219 --> 00:47:58,950
- Hit it.

737
00:47:59,056 --> 00:48:02,423
Ah, you got it.

738
00:48:20,377 --> 00:48:23,972
Nate, stop it.
Stay on your side of the bed.

739
00:48:27,451 --> 00:48:29,749
Nate, I'm serious now.

740
00:48:31,422 --> 00:48:33,083
Hey, it's not me.

741
00:48:37,895 --> 00:48:39,920
Stop hogging all the covers.

742
00:48:40,030 --> 00:48:42,191
All right.
All right, all right.

743
00:49:08,359 --> 00:49:10,259
Aaah!

744
00:49:10,361 --> 00:49:12,022
What?

745
00:49:13,631 --> 00:49:16,191
Get out.!
Get out, get out.!

746
00:49:16,300 --> 00:49:17,665
Get up!

747
00:49:23,941 --> 00:49:26,501
I'm gonna do somethin'.
I'm gonna do somethin'.

748
00:49:29,580 --> 00:49:31,411
Use my shoe.

749
00:49:31,515 --> 00:49:33,676
All right, I got it.
I got it.

750
00:49:33,784 --> 00:49:35,513
Yeah, the shoe!
The shoe!

751
00:49:41,592 --> 00:49:43,560
Aaah!

752
00:49:45,029 --> 00:49:47,589
- Daddy.
- Get back.

753
00:49:47,698 --> 00:49:49,928
- Get out there, Dad.
- Hit it hard!

754
00:49:50,034 --> 00:49:52,059
- Get the alligator! Kill him!
- Get him, Dad.

755
00:49:52,169 --> 00:49:55,002
I know what I'm doing.
I got what I'm doing.

756
00:49:55,105 --> 00:49:57,164
- I don't know what I'm doing.
- Be careful.

757
00:49:57,308 --> 00:49:59,105
Daddy, you're struggling.

758
00:49:59,243 --> 00:50:01,711
Daddy, you're struggling.
Hey. Hey, Daddy, I'm comin;

759
00:50:01,812 --> 00:50:03,370
- I'm gon' help you right now.
- D.J.

760
00:50:03,514 --> 00:50:05,243
DJ...!

761
00:50:05,349 --> 00:50:07,340
Don't go in there!

762
00:50:10,487 --> 00:50:12,648
Oh! Get him, Dad.

763
00:50:12,756 --> 00:50:14,656
I got him.

764
00:50:14,758 --> 00:50:18,091
Get him, Dad.

765
00:50:20,230 --> 00:50:22,221
Get him, Dad.

766
00:50:22,333 --> 00:50:24,062
Oh!

767
00:50:24,168 --> 00:50:26,136
- Hold up.
- I got him. I got him.

768
00:50:26,236 --> 00:50:29,069
You can't drown no alligator.
They live in water.

769
00:50:29,173 --> 00:50:31,266
- That's they habitat.
- I'm gonna flush him.

770
00:50:31,408 --> 00:50:33,467
That's right, Dad.
Flush him. Flush him.

771
00:50:33,610 --> 00:50:36,170
Twinkie? Twinkie.

772
00:50:36,313 --> 00:50:38,406
- Twinkie?
- It's not bath night.

773
00:50:38,549 --> 00:50:42,144
- What... You know this thing?
- Oh, come to Mom.

774
00:50:42,252 --> 00:50:44,618
Oh, Twinkie wouldn't hurt a fly.

775
00:50:44,722 --> 00:50:46,883
- Let's go.
- No. I know, I know.

776
00:50:48,726 --> 00:50:51,388
Shh. Dorothy, your shoes
makin'too much noise.

777
00:50:51,495 --> 00:50:54,692
- Take those off. D.J., pick up your sister.
- I got her.

778
00:50:59,002 --> 00:51:02,631
You are now entering Kansas,
the Sunflower State.

779
00:51:16,286 --> 00:51:19,050
Yo, Dad, can we pull over?

780
00:51:19,156 --> 00:51:24,116
No, son. We can't stop.
I can already smell my mama's cookin'.

781
00:51:24,228 --> 00:51:27,163
But I really need to go.
It'll only take a sec.

782
00:51:27,264 --> 00:51:30,495
D.J., we just stopped in WaKeeney.

783
00:51:30,601 --> 00:51:33,798
Now, I warned you about drinking
all those pepsis so close together.

784
00:51:33,904 --> 00:51:36,964
You're just gonna have to
learn a lesson.

785
00:51:37,074 --> 00:51:39,065
Think of something dry, like...

786
00:51:40,110 --> 00:51:42,078
Mama's meat loaf.

787
00:51:42,179 --> 00:51:44,943
- Come on, Dad.
- We are not stoppin'.

788
00:52:09,173 --> 00:52:11,141
Oh!

789
00:52:35,566 --> 00:52:37,534
You know, son...

790
00:52:37,634 --> 00:52:40,262
the only reason
I'm hard on you is...

791
00:52:40,370 --> 00:52:43,362
well, because one day you'll
wear the pants in your own family.

792
00:52:43,474 --> 00:52:46,272
People will depend on you.

793
00:52:46,410 --> 00:52:48,435
Now, how can they do that...

794
00:52:48,579 --> 00:52:51,104
if your pants are hanging
all off your behind?

795
00:52:51,248 --> 00:52:54,684
Have you thought about what you're gonna
do if this rap thing doesn't work out?

796
00:52:54,785 --> 00:52:59,017
Well, I was thinking about
law school...

797
00:52:59,122 --> 00:53:01,716
or medical school.

798
00:53:01,825 --> 00:53:04,851
But then Mom said
she'll help me incorporate.

799
00:53:04,962 --> 00:53:07,362
So, I was thinking about...

800
00:53:07,464 --> 00:53:09,955
coming out with my own line
of hip-hop pajamas.

801
00:53:10,067 --> 00:53:13,230
- Pajamas?
- Yeah. You know how puffy has Sean John...

802
00:53:13,337 --> 00:53:15,237
and then Jigga has Rocawear?

803
00:53:15,339 --> 00:53:16,897
- Oh, my goodness.
- Check this out.

804
00:53:17,040 --> 00:53:20,100
D.J.'s p. J.'s.
Baggy always.

805
00:53:20,244 --> 00:53:22,144
Baggy.

806
00:53:22,246 --> 00:53:25,977
I told your mother not to stand by the
microwave when she was pregnant with you.

807
00:53:34,625 --> 00:53:37,526
Wait a minute.
What the hell?

808
00:53:37,628 --> 00:53:39,596
Wait a minute.

809
00:53:40,631 --> 00:53:42,599
Stan?

810
00:53:42,699 --> 00:53:44,599
Stan. Yeah, right.

811
00:53:47,538 --> 00:53:49,335
There you go, Stanley.

812
00:53:59,683 --> 00:54:01,674
Yeah.

813
00:54:04,154 --> 00:54:06,349
Man, where's my...

814
00:54:06,456 --> 00:54:09,289
Ah. Let me get
a little swallow.

815
00:54:09,393 --> 00:54:12,157
No. No, no. No.
Dad, don't drink that.

816
00:54:12,930 --> 00:54:14,830
Nah. Dad.

817
00:54:14,932 --> 00:54:17,264
- Dad. Wait, wait. Whoa, whoa.
- What the...

818
00:54:22,606 --> 00:54:26,440
Uh-oh. I wouldn't have
done that if I were you.

819
00:54:28,912 --> 00:54:31,745
Boy, look, I've been driving
since before you were born, okay?

820
00:54:31,848 --> 00:54:34,316
- But you hit a cop.
- I didn't hit a cop.

821
00:54:34,418 --> 00:54:36,909
Oh, I hit a cop.

822
00:54:37,020 --> 00:54:39,716
- Aaah!
- Dad, we off the road.!

823
00:54:39,823 --> 00:54:41,654
- What?
- Whoa.

824
00:54:41,758 --> 00:54:43,350
- Nate, stop!
- Whoa!

825
00:54:44,628 --> 00:54:46,823
Hey, Dad, what are you doing?

826
00:54:46,930 --> 00:54:49,057
Aaah!

827
00:54:50,434 --> 00:54:51,401
Oh, my...

828
00:54:51,501 --> 00:54:53,833
Oh! No!

829
00:54:53,937 --> 00:54:56,269
No, no, no, no.
Come on, man.

830
00:54:56,373 --> 00:54:59,001
- No. Come on. I gotta take this car back.
- Man.

831
00:55:03,280 --> 00:55:06,408
No. Come on, man.

832
00:55:13,290 --> 00:55:15,588
This'll cost me a fortune.
This is ridiculous.

833
00:55:15,692 --> 00:55:17,887
Oh, now the cops.

834
00:55:17,995 --> 00:55:20,020
Biblio... Biblio... Biblioteca.

835
00:55:20,130 --> 00:55:22,360
Oh.

836
00:55:22,466 --> 00:55:24,934
Look. We'll be out of this thing
in 60 seconds.

837
00:55:27,504 --> 00:55:29,563
Hey, hey, Officer.
What's goin' on?

838
00:55:29,673 --> 00:55:32,039
CHips. L... I like that show.

839
00:55:32,175 --> 00:55:35,440
You kinda like a chocolate CHip.
You know what I'm say... CHip ahoy.

840
00:55:35,545 --> 00:55:37,945
- Is everything okay?
- What's up, brother? I can see...

841
00:55:38,048 --> 00:55:41,040
it's a little hot out here
and you got...

842
00:55:41,184 --> 00:55:44,711
Look, man, I'm just tryin' to take
my family down to the reunion.

843
00:55:44,821 --> 00:55:48,052
You know what I'm saying?
So, can you hook a brother up, brother?

844
00:55:50,360 --> 00:55:52,555
Under arrest? All of us?

845
00:55:52,663 --> 00:55:54,927
- For what, man?
- Like you don't know.

846
00:55:55,032 --> 00:55:57,432
You got those rapper rims
wrapped around your tires...

847
00:55:57,534 --> 00:56:00,560
like you had your lips
wrapped around this here reefer pipe.

848
00:56:00,671 --> 00:56:02,696
You should be
ashamed of yourself...

849
00:56:02,806 --> 00:56:06,537
using that poor little girl
like a pack mule.

850
00:56:06,677 --> 00:56:08,645
If we were
two counties south...

851
00:56:08,745 --> 00:56:10,645
you would be in the chair.

852
00:56:10,747 --> 00:56:12,772
Oh, yeah?
Yeah, and I'll sue. I'll sue.

853
00:56:12,916 --> 00:56:15,316
- As a matter of fact, open the gate.
- Nate, come on.

854
00:56:15,419 --> 00:56:18,718
No. Dorothy, let me tell... Open up.
Ain't nothin' but space and opportunity.

855
00:56:18,822 --> 00:56:20,915
That's right.
Look at big, old...

856
00:56:21,024 --> 00:56:24,460
So, what's that gonna be? What you
gonna do with that? I mean...

857
00:56:24,561 --> 00:56:26,495
Daddy!

858
00:56:28,665 --> 00:56:30,633
Mama.

859
00:56:32,769 --> 00:56:35,033
Oh.

860
00:56:35,138 --> 00:56:38,437
Hey. Hey, brother.
L... I mean, Officer.

861
00:56:38,575 --> 00:56:41,043
Hey, I apologize.

862
00:56:41,144 --> 00:56:44,341
- So, can we all go now?
- Tell it to the judge on Monday.

863
00:56:44,448 --> 00:56:48,544
Monday? Man, I gotta be
in Caruthersville by tomorrow.

864
00:56:50,721 --> 00:56:52,814
I don't care
where the hell you gotta be.

865
00:56:52,923 --> 00:56:54,857
You stay in here,
and you shut up.

866
00:56:54,958 --> 00:56:57,188
I have an audit tomorrow.

867
00:56:57,294 --> 00:57:00,957
Destiny.
Muffins.

868
00:57:01,064 --> 00:57:05,262
- Tell your mother for me...
- You told me not to talk to drug dealers.

869
00:57:05,368 --> 00:57:08,394
- What is goin' on?
- I said shut it!

870
00:57:08,505 --> 00:57:10,735
Uh, excuse me, Sheriff.

871
00:57:10,874 --> 00:57:14,002
If you use the 1 040 long form...

872
00:57:14,144 --> 00:57:16,669
you can write off
more than just those doughnuts.

873
00:57:16,813 --> 00:57:19,782
What else can I write off?

874
00:57:28,325 --> 00:57:31,226
- Ma's a saint, huh?
- Yeah, she nice.

875
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:34,195
She all right.

876
00:57:34,297 --> 00:57:37,232
Still gonna go to
Harold's Waffles and Check Cashing...

877
00:57:37,334 --> 00:57:39,302
to get my taxes done.

878
00:57:41,404 --> 00:57:44,840
See, Officer, your biggest problem was
not enough pretax write-offs.

879
00:57:44,975 --> 00:57:47,466
- That's all.
- Oh.

880
00:57:47,611 --> 00:57:50,136
Well, um, thank you, pretty lady.

881
00:57:50,280 --> 00:57:53,044
Um, uh, what can I do for you?

882
00:57:53,150 --> 00:57:55,118
How about the keys?

883
00:58:06,129 --> 00:58:09,098
Nate. The reunion's tomorrow.

884
00:58:09,199 --> 00:58:12,862
We're out of cash.
We... We look a mess.

885
00:58:12,969 --> 00:58:14,994
Let's just pull over
and get ourselves together.

886
00:58:15,105 --> 00:58:17,573
Oh, no. No, no.
Dorothy, no.

887
00:58:17,707 --> 00:58:19,902
Nothing is gonna stop me
from getting that trophy.

888
00:58:20,043 --> 00:58:22,511
And with no food stops,
no bathroom breaks...

889
00:58:22,612 --> 00:58:24,580
anybody that's tired
can sleep in the car.

890
00:58:24,681 --> 00:58:26,672
Nate, no. Nate!

891
00:58:26,817 --> 00:58:28,614
Look at our kids.

892
00:58:33,623 --> 00:58:35,989
- Okay.
- Okay.

893
00:58:36,092 --> 00:58:38,185
All right. I hear you.

894
00:58:38,295 --> 00:58:40,195
We'll pull over.

895
00:58:40,297 --> 00:58:41,559
Thank you.

896
00:58:55,512 --> 00:58:57,605
Oh. No way.

897
00:58:58,882 --> 00:59:01,612
Uh-uh. Nope. That's it.

898
00:59:01,718 --> 00:59:03,845
Hold on. We're goin'.

899
00:59:07,490 --> 00:59:11,859
Fine, Nate. You can drag us
to this family reunion if you want to.

900
00:59:11,962 --> 00:59:16,058
But don't expect me to pretend like
everything's perfect just to impress your mama.

901
00:59:16,166 --> 00:59:18,225
What?
What do you mean by that?

902
00:59:18,335 --> 00:59:20,963
I mean, if she asks me
how we're doing, I'm gon' tell her.

903
00:59:21,071 --> 00:59:23,972
- No, you not! No! No, Dorothy, no.
- Mm-hmm!

904
00:59:24,107 --> 00:59:27,008
That woman has been against
our marriage from the very beginning.

905
00:59:27,110 --> 00:59:29,010
I don't care
how hard you try.

906
00:59:29,112 --> 00:59:32,843
- You will not give her the satisfaction of being right!
- Heh. Watch me.

907
00:59:47,230 --> 00:59:50,131
Nate, how long has that
warning light been on?

908
00:59:50,233 --> 00:59:52,793
Don't worry.
We're not gonna run out of gas.

909
00:59:52,903 --> 00:59:54,871
Trust me.

910
01:00:02,145 --> 01:00:04,613
- Oh, shoot.
- Oh, you gotta be kidding.

911
01:00:04,748 --> 01:00:06,648
Ahh.

912
01:00:09,352 --> 01:00:11,320
Come on!

913
01:00:14,591 --> 01:00:16,491
Come on. Come on.

914
01:00:16,593 --> 01:00:18,493
All right, c...

915
01:00:20,597 --> 01:00:22,895
Okay. All right.
Look, don't panic.

916
01:00:22,999 --> 01:00:25,399
We can still make it
to the reunion.

917
01:00:25,502 --> 01:00:27,970
All right,
I'll just make a call.

918
01:00:28,071 --> 01:00:30,972
Oh, come on. I forgot
to recharge the batteries.

919
01:00:31,074 --> 01:00:33,668
Oh, you gotta be kidding.

920
01:00:33,810 --> 01:00:38,406
Oh, look. Looks like there's a phone
a couple miles up the road.

921
01:00:38,548 --> 01:00:40,982
- A couple miles?
- I'll be right back.

922
01:00:41,084 --> 01:00:43,484
- You're not gonna...
- I'll be right back.

923
01:00:43,586 --> 01:00:45,486
Nate!

924
01:00:50,193 --> 01:00:52,093
Oh, man.

925
01:00:52,195 --> 01:00:54,095
I should run a little bit.

926
01:00:54,197 --> 01:00:56,097
Okay.

927
01:00:56,199 --> 01:00:58,167
That's enough of that.

928
01:01:05,842 --> 01:01:08,106
Wait. What's up?
What's up?

929
01:01:11,281 --> 01:01:14,409
All right, let's see.

930
01:01:14,517 --> 01:01:18,783
All right, let's just find a phone,
call Uncle Earl.

931
01:01:18,888 --> 01:01:22,449
It'll be simple.
Be outta this thing.

932
01:01:22,559 --> 01:01:24,527
Aw, shoot.

933
01:01:26,596 --> 01:01:30,999
Oh, man.! Come on.!
The corn?

934
01:01:32,435 --> 01:01:34,903
I ain't goin' in no corn.
Nope.

935
01:01:41,611 --> 01:01:44,637
Yaah! Aah! Aah!

936
01:01:44,781 --> 01:01:48,342
This... This, uh...

937
01:01:56,693 --> 01:01:59,161
Oh, come on, man!

938
01:01:59,262 --> 01:02:01,992
Who would put a phone
up on a pole? Aww.!

939
01:02:02,098 --> 01:02:05,795
Here we go. Right hand, left foot.
Left foot, right hand.

940
01:02:05,902 --> 01:02:07,836
Just like Twister.

941
01:02:07,937 --> 01:02:10,906
Don't look down.
Don't look down.

942
01:02:11,975 --> 01:02:14,876
Okay. All right. All right.

943
01:02:18,848 --> 01:02:21,476
Hello? Operator.

944
01:02:21,584 --> 01:02:24,246
I need EarlJohnson.

945
01:02:24,354 --> 01:02:26,288
Could you get me
EarlJohnson?

946
01:02:26,389 --> 01:02:29,381
Uncle Earl! This is Nate!
Yeah, right, right. Glorietta's boy.

947
01:02:29,492 --> 01:02:32,689
We ran out of gas on Route 1 2.
Can you come get us?

948
01:03:05,295 --> 01:03:08,560
Looks like y'all seen a ghost.

949
01:03:08,665 --> 01:03:12,328
It's just you, Uncle Earl.

950
01:03:12,435 --> 01:03:15,370
Yeah, it's just me. Who you thought
it was gonna be? Bobby Brown?

951
01:03:15,472 --> 01:03:19,806
That the older girl back there? Girl,
you as pretty as new carpet! Look at her!

952
01:03:19,943 --> 01:03:21,843
Where you stayin'?

953
01:03:21,945 --> 01:03:23,845
Well, we're on our way to the...

954
01:03:23,947 --> 01:03:25,847
- Y'all gon' go down to the house?
- Yeah.

955
01:03:25,949 --> 01:03:29,851
I got room for ya.
Yeah, girl, I got double-wide bunk beds.

956
01:03:29,953 --> 01:03:32,854
Yeah, you come up there,
I'll sleep on top, you be on the bottom.

957
01:03:32,956 --> 01:03:35,857
Either way. You be on bottom, I be on top.
I take it any way I can get it!

958
01:03:35,959 --> 01:03:38,860
I'll take it any way I can get it!

959
01:03:38,962 --> 01:03:42,693
- I said I'll take it any way I can get it!
- I heard you.

960
01:03:42,866 --> 01:03:45,858
Get that hood off.
First thing I gotta do.

961
01:03:45,969 --> 01:03:47,630
Boy, give me the jackhammer.

962
01:03:47,737 --> 01:03:49,932
- All right.
- Mm-hmm.

963
01:03:55,778 --> 01:03:58,303
- Here you are.
- Set it down there.

964
01:03:59,883 --> 01:04:03,944
- Whoa!
- Here we go! Here we go! That's right!

965
01:04:04,053 --> 01:04:06,453
Here we go!
There it is!

966
01:04:06,556 --> 01:04:09,616
- Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
- Watch our headlights!

967
01:04:09,726 --> 01:04:11,921
Looks like y'all ain't
gon' need these fog lights.

968
01:04:12,028 --> 01:04:14,121
I think we just need some gas.

969
01:04:14,230 --> 01:04:16,130
Gas? Heh!

970
01:04:16,232 --> 01:04:19,633
You want gas,
you try some of Glorietta's pinto beans.

971
01:04:19,736 --> 01:04:22,136
Don't worry.
I'll work out a plan.

972
01:04:22,238 --> 01:04:25,071
Fourteen, 1 5 years, I know
a little somethin' 'bout a car, okay?

973
01:04:25,208 --> 01:04:29,235
You just... You keep them little sweet
legs on the inside and don't get hurt.

974
01:04:29,379 --> 01:04:32,280
Sitting there lookin' hot butter.
Hot butter yellow!

975
01:04:32,382 --> 01:04:34,475
Girl is lookin' good.!

976
01:04:34,584 --> 01:04:36,848
Here, boy.

977
01:04:38,888 --> 01:04:42,790
Look like I'm gon' use my heavy artillery.
Lemme get the tweezers.

978
01:04:42,892 --> 01:04:47,261
These my eyelash curlers. Yeah, that's
more delicate. That's more delicate.

979
01:04:47,363 --> 01:04:50,127
Uh, all right.

980
01:04:50,233 --> 01:04:52,098
No, no, no, no, no.

981
01:04:55,538 --> 01:04:57,301
- Ahh.
- You need this?

982
01:04:57,407 --> 01:04:59,307
Okay,
hold on to that.

983
01:04:59,442 --> 01:05:01,410
Oh, God. You're killin' me, Unc.

984
01:05:01,544 --> 01:05:03,535
Yo, Unc, come on.
Come on.

985
01:05:03,680 --> 01:05:07,707
Now hold this and lean that...
lean that over there for me.

986
01:05:07,850 --> 01:05:10,717
Now hand me
the duct tape.

987
01:05:10,820 --> 01:05:13,482
What?

988
01:05:15,091 --> 01:05:17,992
Oh!

989
01:05:20,797 --> 01:05:23,265
Yeah, these are trusty-dusties.

990
01:05:23,366 --> 01:05:25,266
Always use them.

991
01:05:25,368 --> 01:05:28,360
Yeah, one of the best things
you can use is a curling iron.

992
01:05:28,471 --> 01:05:30,371
So, you fixed it, Earl?

993
01:05:30,473 --> 01:05:32,304
Uh-oh.

994
01:05:33,610 --> 01:05:35,635
There's two answers to that one...

995
01:05:35,778 --> 01:05:37,678
No and not yet.

996
01:05:37,780 --> 01:05:41,807
What I realize is...
It's a funny thing. Y'all ain't got no gas.!

997
01:05:41,918 --> 01:05:45,183
- That's what I told you.
- All this time, you didn't have no gas!

998
01:05:45,288 --> 01:05:47,688
But I'll get this thing runnin'.

999
01:05:47,790 --> 01:05:50,987
It'll run on lawn mower fluid.
Put lawn mower fluid in there.

1000
01:05:51,094 --> 01:05:53,995
You won't go as fast.
You'll go about 1 6 miles an hour.

1001
01:05:54,097 --> 01:05:56,998
So I'd always say
stay in the slow lane.

1002
01:05:57,100 --> 01:05:59,000
It's gon' take you about, oh...

1003
01:05:59,102 --> 01:06:01,935
gon' take about 1 6, 1 7 days
to get back to California.

1004
01:06:02,038 --> 01:06:04,768
- What?
- But y'all a family. Y'all'll have a good time.

1005
01:06:04,907 --> 01:06:09,742
I know exactly what to do to have
this car back up on its feet and rollin'.

1006
01:06:29,799 --> 01:06:32,063
Baby, how you doin'?

1007
01:06:35,972 --> 01:06:37,872
There you go.

1008
01:06:38,007 --> 01:06:40,271
Thank you.

1009
01:06:40,410 --> 01:06:42,878
Just what you think you doin'?

1010
01:06:43,012 --> 01:06:45,412
Stickin' your fingers in my food.

1011
01:06:45,515 --> 01:06:47,813
Hey, Uncle Earl.!
Park around back.!

1012
01:06:47,917 --> 01:06:50,317
I don't want nobody
messin' with my truck!

1013
01:06:52,689 --> 01:06:54,384
All right.
I hear you, nephew.

1014
01:07:00,196 --> 01:07:04,997
Hey, everybody.! Look who I found on
the side of the road.! It's Nate and them.!

1015
01:07:05,101 --> 01:07:09,197
Just let us out right here.
This is good, right here.

1016
01:07:11,307 --> 01:07:14,333
- Nathaniel! Come on. I'm gon' have to spank your butt.
- Oh, it's Uncle Nate.

1017
01:07:14,477 --> 01:07:17,037
Oh, Lord have mercy.

1018
01:07:19,415 --> 01:07:21,315
Girl, you look good.

1019
01:07:21,417 --> 01:07:24,409
If you don't look like
hot sauce on a pork rind, I tell ya...

1020
01:07:24,520 --> 01:07:28,388
- Come on, give Earl some of that.
- Oh! Uh... Uh...

1021
01:07:28,491 --> 01:07:30,925
You is a hot-buttered red bone...
Look at you, girl.!

1022
01:07:31,027 --> 01:07:34,394
- You look delicious, like a perfect piece of fried chicken.
- Uncle Earl!

1023
01:07:34,497 --> 01:07:37,625
Uncle Earl.! Come on, man.
That's my wife.

1024
01:07:37,734 --> 01:07:40,464
- Come on, baby.
- Stop bein' a player-hater.

1025
01:07:40,570 --> 01:07:44,097
- Can you do something with the truck?
- I'm gon' take care of that.

1026
01:07:44,207 --> 01:07:46,107
Don't you worry about it.

1027
01:07:46,242 --> 01:07:50,941
I'll take the carburetor off there,
put it back on, take the concrete off there.

1028
01:07:51,047 --> 01:07:55,347
That'll be about $25-3 5. But just bring me
back a six-pack of beer, that's all.

1029
01:07:55,451 --> 01:07:58,682
Look, there's the hill where
the tree was I told you I fell out of.

1030
01:07:58,788 --> 01:08:01,222
- And there's the lake I used to fish...
- Hey, second-born!

1031
01:08:01,324 --> 01:08:04,054
Junior Mint.!

1032
01:08:04,160 --> 01:08:06,560
Mama's little mistake
down at the lake.

1033
01:08:06,662 --> 01:08:08,823
- How y'all doin'?
- Hey, Mack.

1034
01:08:08,931 --> 01:08:12,799
- Hey, Dorothy. I don't know how you do it.
- Mack, how you doin'?

1035
01:08:12,902 --> 01:08:15,803
Hey, look, Mama up here at the table.
Y'all come on.

1036
01:08:15,905 --> 01:08:17,873
Ooh-wee!

1037
01:08:19,108 --> 01:08:22,043
Hey, Mama!

1038
01:08:22,145 --> 01:08:24,375
- Grandma!
- And there's the birthday girl!

1039
01:08:24,480 --> 01:08:26,380
Oh, look at you guys!

1040
01:08:26,482 --> 01:08:29,713
My God! You're gettin' so big!
Look at you!

1041
01:08:29,819 --> 01:08:34,119
Dorothy, I can't believe
we finally got you down here.

1042
01:08:34,223 --> 01:08:37,124
I guess that means
you two are still together.

1043
01:08:37,226 --> 01:08:39,387
Well, Glorietta,
the truth is that...

1044
01:08:39,495 --> 01:08:42,555
- I can't believe you two made it this far.
- What you talkin' 'bout, Mama?

1045
01:08:42,665 --> 01:08:46,192
- The trip's less than 2,000 miles.
- I'm not talkin' about miles.

1046
01:08:46,302 --> 01:08:48,202
Talkin' 'bout years.

1047
01:08:48,304 --> 01:08:50,568
Anyway,
what were you gonna say?

1048
01:08:50,673 --> 01:08:53,141
What I was gonna say is...

1049
01:08:53,242 --> 01:08:57,645
Nate and I are going to renew
our wedding vows on Valentine's Day...

1050
01:08:57,747 --> 01:09:00,648
and we would sure love
for you to join us.

1051
01:09:01,884 --> 01:09:04,853
Mmm.

1052
01:09:04,954 --> 01:09:06,854
Come on, child.

1053
01:09:06,956 --> 01:09:09,356
Food's on the table.
Family's waitin' for you.

1054
01:09:09,459 --> 01:09:12,360
Both my boys here.
This is better than Christmas.!

1055
01:09:12,462 --> 01:09:15,363
Even better than that Christmas
I got you that new car, Mama?

1056
01:09:15,465 --> 01:09:17,558
Mack, you know
this ain't no competition.

1057
01:09:17,667 --> 01:09:20,158
We gon' let Mack and Nate pray.

1058
01:09:20,269 --> 01:09:24,296
See which one of'em was payin'
more attention in Sunday school.

1059
01:09:24,407 --> 01:09:27,672
Well, I guess since I'm the oldest,
I go first.

1060
01:09:27,810 --> 01:09:29,710
Fine.

1061
01:09:29,812 --> 01:09:33,509
All right, everyone,
bow your heads...

1062
01:09:33,616 --> 01:09:35,709
and close your ears.

1063
01:09:35,818 --> 01:09:37,718
Your eyes.

1064
01:09:37,820 --> 01:09:40,516
Everybody close your eyes.

1065
01:09:43,025 --> 01:09:45,585
Gracious God, I come to you...

1066
01:09:45,695 --> 01:09:47,595
as humbly as I know how...

1067
01:09:47,697 --> 01:09:49,289
Yes, Lord.

1068
01:09:49,398 --> 01:09:51,457
Praising you
and giving you thanks...

1069
01:09:51,567 --> 01:09:54,297
for bringing us together
yet another year...

1070
01:09:54,403 --> 01:09:58,066
helping us come together
to help celebrate...

1071
01:09:58,207 --> 01:10:00,835
my victory...

1072
01:10:00,977 --> 01:10:03,912
and Nate's agony of defeat.

1073
01:10:04,013 --> 01:10:05,412
Let us eat.

1074
01:10:05,515 --> 01:10:08,951
Father, Lord, we thank you...

1075
01:10:09,051 --> 01:10:12,851
for allowing us to come together
and share with one another.

1076
01:10:12,955 --> 01:10:16,914
Father, we know that you
created the birds that fly...

1077
01:10:17,026 --> 01:10:21,122
and gave the dogs a voice to bark.

1078
01:10:21,230 --> 01:10:23,460
But you wouldn't have
had to create the sun...

1079
01:10:23,566 --> 01:10:27,696
if you knew Mack was gonna be sittin'
over there in that bright yellow shirt...

1080
01:10:27,803 --> 01:10:30,704
lookin'sunny-side up like
a Rooty Tooty Fresh and Fruity.!

1081
01:10:30,806 --> 01:10:33,366
- Oh, Lord, Lord, Lord!
- Mm-mmm-mmm.

1082
01:10:33,509 --> 01:10:36,034
We, Father God, also realize...

1083
01:10:36,178 --> 01:10:40,342
that you are the creator
of earth and heaven...

1084
01:10:40,449 --> 01:10:43,748
moon and the stars.

1085
01:10:43,853 --> 01:10:45,753
That's how I know...

1086
01:10:45,855 --> 01:10:48,756
ain't no way
you had nothin' to do...

1087
01:10:48,858 --> 01:10:52,851
with creatin' that tacky,
gangsta-lookin', wheel-spinnin'S.U. V...

1088
01:10:52,962 --> 01:10:55,988
that Uncle Earl had to
drag up in here.

1089
01:10:56,098 --> 01:11:00,501
Hold on, Father!
Hold up! Wait a minute!

1090
01:11:00,603 --> 01:11:03,436
What about the time
you put pepto-Bismol in the Kool-Aid...

1091
01:11:03,539 --> 01:11:05,871
and everybody had diarrhea
for the summer?

1092
01:11:06,008 --> 01:11:08,704
- Don't let me have to mention that to Mama!
- Hold on.!

1093
01:11:08,844 --> 01:11:12,245
What about the time you burned down
all the bushes 'round the house...

1094
01:11:12,348 --> 01:11:15,215
'cause you got tired of goin'outside,
gettin'your own switch...

1095
01:11:15,318 --> 01:11:19,379
Ohhh, Father!

1096
01:11:21,657 --> 01:11:24,558
Need I have to remind Mack
while Mama's standin' here...

1097
01:11:24,660 --> 01:11:27,993
that he the one that had Nanette Green
in the back room...

1098
01:11:28,097 --> 01:11:30,998
and was doin' the nasty
on Mama's good quilt...

1099
01:11:31,100 --> 01:11:34,001
and that's why she couldn't
get them stains off of it?

1100
01:11:34,103 --> 01:11:36,901
In Jesus' name!
Let's eat.

1101
01:11:37,006 --> 01:11:39,099
- But, Mama... B-But, Mama, look...
- Uh-uh.!

1102
01:11:39,241 --> 01:11:41,869
Y'all just got through prayin'.
Don't make me cuss up in here.

1103
01:11:42,011 --> 01:11:44,605
- Remember there was a lamp...
- Aah! I got all the stories.

1104
01:11:44,747 --> 01:11:46,647
That's great.

1105
01:11:46,749 --> 01:11:49,650
Let's go down here
and visit with Nate's family.

1106
01:11:49,752 --> 01:11:52,050
Drove all the way here
from California.

1107
01:11:52,154 --> 01:11:55,055
Last time they was here
little Destiny was two years old.

1108
01:11:55,157 --> 01:11:57,421
Hey, Nate.
How you doin', kids?

1109
01:11:57,526 --> 01:12:00,324
Hey, how's it goin'?

1110
01:12:00,429 --> 01:12:03,227
Kinfolk.!

1111
01:12:05,334 --> 01:12:07,734
I'll be over there in a minute.

1112
01:12:07,837 --> 01:12:11,068
Cousin Nate! Favorite kinfolk!

1113
01:12:11,173 --> 01:12:13,073
Hey, man!

1114
01:12:13,209 --> 01:12:16,110
- How you doin', man? You doin' all right?
- All right.

1115
01:12:16,212 --> 01:12:19,113
Heard you doin' good in that
insurance thing. I'm proud of ya.

1116
01:12:19,215 --> 01:12:22,116
We all proud of ya, but I'm especially
proud of... What did I tell ya?

1117
01:12:22,218 --> 01:12:25,483
I told you two years ago... Me, now.
Do that insurance thing.

1118
01:12:25,588 --> 01:12:27,988
- That's right.
- I told you. Look at you now.

1119
01:12:28,090 --> 01:12:29,990
Let me hold somethin'.

1120
01:12:30,092 --> 01:12:32,993
- Come on, Bodie! I just got here, man.
- Well, anything, any...

1121
01:12:33,095 --> 01:12:34,995
What about them glasses?
Them prescription?

1122
01:12:35,097 --> 01:12:38,999
Look... Look, man, I'll see if
I can do somethin' for you later.

1123
01:12:39,101 --> 01:12:41,001
All right.

1124
01:12:41,103 --> 01:12:43,503
You know you my favorite kinfolk.
I'll be right here.

1125
01:12:43,606 --> 01:12:45,506
- I know.
- I ain't goin' nowhere.

1126
01:12:45,641 --> 01:12:47,734
- I know you not.
- Watchin' every move.

1127
01:12:47,877 --> 01:12:51,813
Why y'all leave me
over there with him?

1128
01:12:51,947 --> 01:12:54,711
Hey, yo, Johnson family, it's time
for the event we've all been waitin'for.

1129
01:12:54,817 --> 01:12:58,844
That's right... the 2004
Family of the Year Competition!

1130
01:12:58,954 --> 01:13:02,219
Y'all ready to do this?
Let's get this thing started.!

1131
01:13:02,324 --> 01:13:04,224
Crawl, like we worked on.

1132
01:13:04,326 --> 01:13:07,159
I've got you. Not gonna let you go.

1133
01:13:07,263 --> 01:13:09,288
- He's nothing.
- Don't let him scare you.

1134
01:13:09,398 --> 01:13:12,299
Don't let him scare you.
Here we go. All right.

1135
01:13:12,401 --> 01:13:14,301
- Okay.
- All right, sweetie.

1136
01:13:14,403 --> 01:13:16,769
- I'm gonna do it, Daddy.
- Do it.

1137
01:13:16,872 --> 01:13:18,840
- We need this.
- I know, Daddy.

1138
01:13:23,713 --> 01:13:26,113
Oh, there they go again.

1139
01:13:26,215 --> 01:13:28,115
Stop that fightin;!

1140
01:13:28,217 --> 01:13:30,515
- Hey, Mama.
- On your mark.

1141
01:13:30,619 --> 01:13:33,520
Get set.

1142
01:13:34,957 --> 01:13:37,084

Come on, Junior.!
You got 'em.! You got 'em, Mack.!

1144
01:13:39,995 --> 01:13:41,860
Go!

1145

- You got 'em, baby! Do it, MackJunior!
- Go! Come on!

1146
01:13:51,874 --> 01:13:54,638
Monkey bar swingin'!
Monkey bar swingin'!

1147
01:13:54,777 --> 01:13:56,802
- Go!
- You got it.! You got it.!

1148
01:13:56,946 --> 01:13:59,073
Come on.!

1149
01:13:59,215 --> 01:14:01,206
Oh, Lord, he fell!

1150
01:14:01,317 --> 01:14:03,285
Hey, you...

1151
01:14:04,954 --> 01:14:06,819
- Yeah!
- Daddy, I did it!

1152
01:14:06,922 --> 01:14:09,686
She cheated!

1153
01:14:09,792 --> 01:14:13,228
Next event, the water
balloon toss.! Let's do this, y'all.!

1154
01:14:14,830 --> 01:14:17,560
Somebody gonna get
a whuppin' out here.

1155
01:14:19,668 --> 01:14:23,229
Mack, that gives your family two points
and Nate's family two points.

1156
01:14:23,339 --> 01:14:25,864
Last event... the sack race, y'all!

1157
01:14:26,008 --> 01:14:29,967
Oh, yeah, baby. You can kiss
that Family of the Year trophy good-bye.

1158
01:14:30,112 --> 01:14:32,012
Oh, I will...

1159
01:14:32,114 --> 01:14:34,514
every mornin' on my way to work.

1160
01:14:34,617 --> 01:14:36,881
Get set.! Go.!

1161
01:14:40,122 --> 01:14:42,522
- Till you were 1 2!
- I ain't had no plastic on the bed.

1162
01:14:42,625 --> 01:14:44,684
- Yes, you did, bed wetter.
- H-H-Hold up, man.

1163
01:14:44,794 --> 01:14:47,058
- Ain't nobody peed in the bed.
- Whoa, whoa, whoa.

1164
01:14:47,163 --> 01:14:50,291
- You act like you tryin'to pull somethin'...
- You always talkin' that stuff.

1165
01:14:50,399 --> 01:14:52,594
I know that was you
that hung up on me.

1166
01:14:52,701 --> 01:14:55,602
Whatever!

1167
01:14:55,704 --> 01:14:57,262
Why you runnin'?

1168
01:14:57,373 --> 01:14:59,534
Ain't nobody runnin'!

1169
01:14:59,675 --> 01:15:02,701
- Throw him to the ground!
- Why you got my leg?

1170
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,281
That's what I thought.
That's what I thought.

1171
01:15:07,383 --> 01:15:10,181
- You done made us lose the race.
- I ain't thinkin' about that race.

1172
01:15:10,286 --> 01:15:13,016
Why you tryin' to get ahead of me?
Why you tryin'...

1173
01:15:13,122 --> 01:15:15,181
Why you lookin'...
I'm first! I'm first!

1174
01:15:19,728 --> 01:15:22,128
I think I hurt my corn.

1175
01:15:24,633 --> 01:15:28,433
We got a tie, y'all.
Ha-ha, Johnson family! What?

1176
01:15:28,537 --> 01:15:30,437
- Kinfolk.!
- Yeah, what's up?

1177
01:15:30,539 --> 01:15:33,770
Heard you in California,
'bout to break in that rap game, baby!

1178
01:15:33,909 --> 01:15:36,878
- Whoo! 'Bout to get paid!
- Hey!

1179
01:15:37,012 --> 01:15:38,980
Let me hold somethin'.

1180
01:15:43,719 --> 01:15:47,780
I don't have no money on me right now.
You know? I'm broke.

1181
01:15:47,890 --> 01:15:49,790
- You ain't got nothin'?
- Nada.

1182
01:15:49,892 --> 01:15:52,861
What about them tennis shoes right there?
What size those?

1183
01:15:52,962 --> 01:15:55,157
They're my size.

1184
01:15:56,198 --> 01:15:58,098
You trippin'.

1185
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:00,100
Kinfolk!

1186
01:16:00,202 --> 01:16:03,262
That's right. You know how we do it
Johnson family style.

1187
01:16:03,372 --> 01:16:06,830
It's time to really get our party on now.
Come on, Johnsons!

1188
01:16:06,976 --> 01:16:10,036
There's no time to rehearse.
It's time for someJohnson magic.

1189
01:16:10,179 --> 01:16:12,079
This is for the trophy.

1190
01:16:12,181 --> 01:16:15,446
- The talent show is the tiebreaker event.
- Right.

1191
01:16:15,551 --> 01:16:18,782
Destiny and I will do choreography.
But what do we do for costumes?

1192
01:16:18,888 --> 01:16:21,118
- Mama, I'll do it.
- What about the music?

1193
01:16:21,223 --> 01:16:23,248
I got the music.

1194
01:16:25,027 --> 01:16:27,928
- We gon'hit 'em
upside the head with this one.

1195
01:16:28,030 --> 01:16:30,931
- Everyone know what they're supposed to do?
- Yeah.!

1196
01:16:31,033 --> 01:16:32,933
Okay, Johnson family on three.

1197
01:16:33,035 --> 01:16:35,435
- One! Two! Three!
- Johnsons!

1198
01:16:35,537 --> 01:16:38,438
- All right, let's go. All right?
- Got it.

1199
01:16:38,540 --> 01:16:40,440
All right. Okay.

1200
01:16:40,576 --> 01:16:42,908
Big Shaq-style boy.! That's you, Mack.!

1201
01:16:43,012 --> 01:16:46,243
- Hey, D.J.!
- You are the mack from way back.!

1202
01:16:46,348 --> 01:16:48,816
Mack-a-licious.!
Mack-a-docious.! Mack-tastic.!

1203
01:16:48,951 --> 01:16:50,885
You Mack-aroni, dog.!

1204
01:16:50,986 --> 01:16:54,012
You Mack.! Man, you the Mack.!

1205
01:17:14,109 --> 01:17:16,009
Their moves are so tight.

1206
01:17:16,111 --> 01:17:18,511
I see why they win every year.

1207
01:17:18,614 --> 01:17:22,311
Oh, come on, baby. It's nothing.
Look at Mack out there.

1208
01:17:22,418 --> 01:17:26,912
Little karate uniform on, lookin'
like Nappy Chan doin' "Try-Bo. "

1209
01:17:28,958 --> 01:17:30,892
Come on.

1210
01:17:52,581 --> 01:17:55,482
Thank you, thank you,
thank you, thank you all.

1211
01:17:55,584 --> 01:17:57,484
Hear me when I say it to you.

1212
01:17:57,586 --> 01:18:00,419
We do love you.
We love everybody. Got love for you.

1213
01:18:00,522 --> 01:18:02,854
No, no.! We do love you all.!

1214
01:18:02,958 --> 01:18:06,359
Now, comin' up next is
my baby brother Nate and his family.

1215
01:18:06,462 --> 01:18:08,362
Please do somethin'.
Clap or somethin'.

1216
01:18:08,464 --> 01:18:11,365
But whatever you do,
Lord, have mercy...

1217
01:18:11,467 --> 01:18:13,367
please don't fall asleep.

1218
01:18:13,469 --> 01:18:16,495
Love you!

1219
01:18:18,707 --> 01:18:20,868
Nate, you sure got your work
cut out for you.

1220
01:18:21,043 --> 01:18:24,103
- Nate's back again.!
- Nate's stuff is raggedy.!

1221
01:18:24,246 --> 01:18:26,214
What's Nate gon'do?

1222
01:18:26,348 --> 01:18:28,316
- What's up, D.J.?
- Let's do this, dog!

1223
01:18:28,417 --> 01:18:30,715
- You know they ain't got nothin;!
- All right.

1224
01:18:34,089 --> 01:18:38,389
All right, everybody get on board.
This is NateJohnson.

1225
01:18:38,494 --> 01:18:41,725
We are theJohnson family
from Los Angeles.

1226
01:18:43,265 --> 01:18:45,233
Gettin' ready to give it to ya
a little somethin' like this.

1227
01:18:46,335 --> 01:18:48,269
Watch out, Mack! Ha-ha!

1228
01:19:19,201 --> 01:19:21,328
All right, now, Johnsons.
Y'all come on with it now.

1229
01:19:23,572 --> 01:19:25,506
Here we go!

1230
01:19:35,884 --> 01:19:40,116
That music's feelin' so good right

1231
01:19:55,604 --> 01:19:57,299
Oh, yeah!

01:19:57,406 --> 01:20:01,365
Gettin' ready to bring it to ya

1233
01:20:36,211 --> 01:20:38,304
That's my son right there!

1234
01:21:28,297 --> 01:21:30,822
Yeah.! Whoo.!

1235
01:21:34,469 --> 01:21:37,131
Whoo!

1236
01:21:38,273 --> 01:21:40,173
Didn't I tell you
I could rhyme?

1237
01:21:40,309 --> 01:21:42,277
- That's all right!
- We did it!

1238
01:21:43,612 --> 01:21:46,706
Here, man, take that.
You can use that, dog.

1239
01:21:50,319 --> 01:21:52,685
Okay, y'all, come on!

1240
01:21:52,788 --> 01:21:55,689
Okay, y'all,
time to choose a winner.

1241
01:21:55,791 --> 01:21:57,691
Good job, man.
Great job.

1242
01:21:57,793 --> 01:21:59,693
Good job, man.
Good job.

1243
01:21:59,795 --> 01:22:01,626
- Yeah, we beat 'em.
- Okay, y'all.

1244
01:22:01,730 --> 01:22:03,630
Now, we theJohnson family...

1245
01:22:03,732 --> 01:22:07,429
and y'all know how we do it,
so let's get it on.

1246
01:22:07,536 --> 01:22:11,438
- Who thinks Mack's family
won the talent competition?

1247
01:22:11,540 --> 01:22:14,998
Calm down. Calm down.

1248
01:22:26,488 --> 01:22:29,013
Damn.

1249
01:22:29,124 --> 01:22:31,024
How you doin'?

1250
01:22:31,126 --> 01:22:33,185
Is she family?

1251
01:22:33,295 --> 01:22:35,695
All right, it was close...

1252
01:22:35,797 --> 01:22:37,765
but...

1253
01:22:37,866 --> 01:22:39,766
Nate's family wins the title!

1254
01:22:45,507 --> 01:22:47,498
- Congratulations, son.
- Thank you, Mama.

1255
01:22:47,643 --> 01:22:49,907
Oh, Father.

1256
01:22:53,482 --> 01:22:55,382
You know what?

1257
01:22:55,484 --> 01:22:58,385
I just realized I don't need this trophy
to prove I have a great family.

1258
01:22:58,487 --> 01:23:00,318
Here.

1259
01:23:00,422 --> 01:23:05,018
The only trophy I need
is these four right behind me.

1260
01:23:05,127 --> 01:23:09,086
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whatever.
Long as I got the trophy.

1261
01:23:10,265 --> 01:23:12,392
I got the trophy!

1262
01:23:12,501 --> 01:23:14,526
Mack. Mack.!

1263
01:23:14,636 --> 01:23:17,764
- We got the trophy.!
- Come on, dog. Mack!

1264
01:23:17,873 --> 01:23:20,933
Come on, man.
We brothers.

1265
01:23:21,076 --> 01:23:24,170
We should be teammates,
not competitors.

1266
01:23:25,547 --> 01:23:27,447
- Yeah...
- What do you say?

1267
01:23:27,549 --> 01:23:29,517
Yeah, you're right, Nate.

1268
01:23:30,552 --> 01:23:33,077
Yes! Yes!
We got it! Come on.

1269
01:23:33,188 --> 01:23:36,089
Yes! I got the trophy!

1270
01:23:36,191 --> 01:23:38,421
Anyway, you know what?

1271
01:23:38,527 --> 01:23:42,429
- I realize that after this victory today...
- Yeah?

1272
01:23:42,531 --> 01:23:44,465
Nothing can separate us.

1273
01:23:52,107 --> 01:23:54,234
Get out the way, june bug!

1274
01:23:56,111 --> 01:23:58,477
Where the truck come from?

1275
01:24:02,517 --> 01:24:06,248
Oh, Father!
Oh, Father!

1276
01:24:06,355 --> 01:24:08,653
I'm okay, baby.

1277
01:24:08,757 --> 01:24:11,385
Oh, Lord, why not me?

1278
01:24:11,493 --> 01:24:13,393
Jesus, why not me?

1279
01:24:13,495 --> 01:24:17,397
I can't believe this!

1280
01:24:17,499 --> 01:24:21,333
This trophy ain't never
done nothin' to nobody!

1281
01:24:21,436 --> 01:24:24,064
What did I ever do?

1282
01:24:24,172 --> 01:24:27,335
What did I do?
Oh, Father!

1283
01:24:27,476 --> 01:24:29,376
Who beat me?

1284
01:24:29,478 --> 01:24:31,446
What is he doing?

1285
01:24:33,248 --> 01:24:35,148
Oh, my God.

1286
01:24:35,250 --> 01:24:37,844
- Stan, what are you doing here?
- Yeah!

1287
01:24:37,953 --> 01:24:40,854
Dorothy, you said...

1288
01:24:40,956 --> 01:24:43,516
you wanted
to be with me forever.

1289
01:24:43,625 --> 01:24:46,992
I said our professor
was lecturing forever.

1290
01:24:47,095 --> 01:24:49,996
- Man, are you the dude drivin' the truck?
- Stan, you are crazy.

1291
01:24:50,098 --> 01:24:52,498
We only studied together twice.

1292
01:24:52,601 --> 01:24:55,161
And one of those times
was over the phone!

1293
01:24:55,270 --> 01:24:58,171
- I have a husband!
- Yeah, she has a husband!

1294
01:24:58,273 --> 01:25:00,764
You ruin my family reunion
with this nonsense?

1295
01:25:00,909 --> 01:25:04,606
If that's the case, then why do you two
live in separate houses?

1296
01:25:04,746 --> 01:25:06,646
Yeah.

1297
01:25:06,748 --> 01:25:09,945
Why do you live
in separate houses?

1298
01:25:12,053 --> 01:25:16,990
Mama, Dorothy and I have been
separated for about three months.

1299
01:25:17,092 --> 01:25:18,992
Ohh!

1300
01:25:19,094 --> 01:25:21,460
I knew it.
I knew it!

1301
01:25:21,563 --> 01:25:25,465
Look, it's all my fault why
we're not together. All right?

1302
01:25:25,567 --> 01:25:28,468
I just haven't supported her
in her dreams.

1303
01:25:28,570 --> 01:25:31,334
She's a beautiful,
intelligent woman...

1304
01:25:31,440 --> 01:25:33,431
and the copilot of my plane.

1305
01:25:33,542 --> 01:25:37,034
Nate got a plane?
Mama, where did Nate get a plane?

1306
01:25:37,179 --> 01:25:39,409
Mack, will you hush, please.

1307
01:25:39,514 --> 01:25:44,451
And, Mama, look, I've let you drive a wedge
between me and my wife for all these years.

1308
01:25:44,553 --> 01:25:47,488
Furthermore, she's the mother
of your grandchildren.

1309
01:25:47,589 --> 01:25:51,423
So I suggest you get used to her,
because I'm not letting her go anywhere.

1310
01:25:51,526 --> 01:25:53,426
Ah!

1311
01:25:53,528 --> 01:25:57,055
- And neither am I.
- You know what? That's about enough of you.

1312
01:25:57,165 --> 01:25:59,599
- Uh-uh! No, no, no, no!
- Dad, don't do that!

1313
01:25:59,701 --> 01:26:02,465
Would you leave, Stan? Please!

1314
01:26:02,571 --> 01:26:04,129
Wait! Don't do it, son.

1315
01:26:04,239 --> 01:26:08,198
- Let me!
- Ohh!

1316
01:26:08,310 --> 01:26:10,505
Mama cracked him!
Mama say c-crack!

1317
01:26:10,645 --> 01:26:13,546
Mama was your dessert!
That's what theJohnsons do!

1318
01:26:13,648 --> 01:26:15,548
She's still got it.

1319
01:26:15,650 --> 01:26:17,550
You know what?

1320
01:26:17,652 --> 01:26:20,450
I ain't never heard you
talk about Dorothy that way.

1321
01:26:20,555 --> 01:26:22,455
And you know what else?

1322
01:26:22,557 --> 01:26:24,354
It's about time.

1323
01:26:26,695 --> 01:26:28,595
- Thank you, Mama.
- That's right, Dad.

1324
01:26:28,697 --> 01:26:31,222
All right, I gotta get my family outta here.
We gotta head back home.

1325
01:26:31,333 --> 01:26:33,233
But you just got here.!

1326
01:26:33,335 --> 01:26:35,235
I know, but...

1327
01:26:35,337 --> 01:26:37,805
my wife has a test to study for.

1328
01:26:39,241 --> 01:26:42,540
- Kids, let's go change. Bye, Mama.
- Bye, baby.

1329
01:26:44,412 --> 01:26:47,074
- Dorothy.
- All right, now, little brother.

1330
01:26:47,182 --> 01:26:49,082
- Bye, Grandma.
- Bye, D.J.

1331
01:26:49,184 --> 01:26:52,085
- Y'all come back! Don't stay gone so long.
- All right.

1332
01:26:52,187 --> 01:26:54,155
Oh, man.

1333
01:26:55,557 --> 01:26:57,024
- Yeah.!
- Nate! Nate!

1334
01:26:57,125 --> 01:27:00,288
It's NateJohnson! All day!

1335
01:27:00,395 --> 01:27:02,386
Trophy and my little brother?

1336
01:27:02,497 --> 01:27:06,661
And I'm MackJohnson!
That's all week.!

1337
01:27:06,768 --> 01:27:09,669
I wonder... I wonder if Uncle Earl
know how to fix this.

1338
01:27:09,771 --> 01:27:12,467
I'm gon' ask... Uncle Earl!

1339
01:27:14,876 --> 01:27:17,071
Hey!

1340
01:27:17,212 --> 01:27:19,112
Huh!

1341
01:27:19,214 --> 01:27:21,079
Huh! Yeah!

1342
01:27:23,885 --> 01:27:26,353
- Reenie?
- Yeah, baby?

1343
01:27:26,454 --> 01:27:28,684
Get in here, girl!

1344
01:27:39,401 --> 01:27:42,495
D.J., is that our door?

1345
01:27:42,604 --> 01:27:46,472
Oh, no, no, no, no.
Is this our bumper?

1346
01:27:46,608 --> 01:27:49,509
- This is the bumper from the truck.
- Looks like it, but...

1347
01:27:52,113 --> 01:27:55,514
And... these are the seats.

1348
01:27:55,617 --> 01:27:58,518
Oh, my God. These seats
come right out of the truck.

1349
01:28:00,155 --> 01:28:02,487
Dorothy, that is the door.!

1350
01:28:02,591 --> 01:28:04,582
Looks like the door.
We don't know.

1351
01:28:04,693 --> 01:28:08,652
You ain't got nothin' on that Robot.
You know, I do the Robot.

1352
01:28:11,066 --> 01:28:12,761
Oh, my God!

1353
01:28:12,867 --> 01:28:15,097
Move somethin;!

1354
01:28:15,203 --> 01:28:18,195
- That's my kid!
- Look.

1355
01:28:20,609 --> 01:28:22,509
Okay. Okay.

1356
01:28:22,611 --> 01:28:24,101
Uncle Earl!

1357
01:28:26,114 --> 01:28:28,378
Uncle Earl!
Uncle Earl!

1358
01:28:30,318 --> 01:28:32,218
Oh, hey there, nephew.

1359
01:28:32,320 --> 01:28:35,255
Y'all caught me off guard.
Caught me doin' my little thing...

1360
01:28:35,357 --> 01:28:37,348
Look at Dorothy.

1361
01:28:37,459 --> 01:28:39,154
Girl, you look good.

1362
01:28:39,260 --> 01:28:42,593
Girl, if you don't look like
a hot cup of soup, and I got the flu...

1363
01:28:47,268 --> 01:28:49,395
- This my baby, Tangerine.
- Hi!

1364
01:28:49,504 --> 01:28:51,563
Yeah, don't she look like you?

1365
01:28:51,673 --> 01:28:56,576
She look just like you. I tell her all
the time, "You look just like Dorothy. "

1366
01:28:56,678 --> 01:28:59,943
You know what, Dorothy?
This could've all been yours. All this...

1367
01:29:01,983 --> 01:29:03,883
Reenie, come on, now.

1368
01:29:03,985 --> 01:29:06,010
Quit playin'.
You know I'm p-I-M-p.

1369
01:29:06,121 --> 01:29:09,215
If you don't mind, it's been a long trip
and we wanna get back home...

1370
01:29:09,324 --> 01:29:11,224
so, did you fix the truck yet?

1371
01:29:11,326 --> 01:29:14,386
Oh, yeah, it's ready.
Truck is ready. That's what I do.

1372
01:29:14,496 --> 01:29:16,396
Yeah, come on out.
Yeah.

1373
01:29:17,432 --> 01:29:19,866
Yes, indeedy!

1374
01:29:19,968 --> 01:29:22,937
Now, I'm gon' have to tell you...

1375
01:29:23,038 --> 01:29:26,872
the only thing I had to do here that was
really special... want you to be aware of...

1376
01:29:27,008 --> 01:29:29,909
I had to run a coat hanger
through the middle of the vehicle.

1377
01:29:30,011 --> 01:29:33,071
It came up around the chassis,
broke off on each side...

1378
01:29:33,214 --> 01:29:35,409
and go into your wheel well.

1379
01:29:35,517 --> 01:29:40,216
Now, the only thing I suggest is
that you don't make no sharp turns.

1380
01:29:40,321 --> 01:29:42,050
- Okay?
- Great.

1381
01:29:42,157 --> 01:29:45,126
A sharp turn, and you can
hang it up.

1382
01:29:47,328 --> 01:29:49,489
- "You can hang it up. "
- Yeah.

1383
01:29:49,597 --> 01:29:51,497
- I tell ya.!
- Funny.

1384
01:29:51,599 --> 01:29:54,090
Okay, here we go.

1385
01:29:58,740 --> 01:30:01,106
Ohh-ho-ho.!

1386
01:30:01,242 --> 01:30:03,142
Cool!

1387
01:30:03,244 --> 01:30:05,269
That looks great, Uncle Earl!

1388
01:30:05,413 --> 01:30:08,007
- That look good, don't it?
- All right!

1389
01:30:08,116 --> 01:30:10,141
- All right!
- I retooled your engine.

1390
01:30:10,251 --> 01:30:12,811
I flushed the engine out
with a toothpaste flush.

1391
01:30:12,921 --> 01:30:15,446
- Fluoride toothpaste. Best thing for it.
- Earl!

1392
01:30:15,557 --> 01:30:19,789
Hold it. There's something... You know what
this car doesn't have in it? An eight-track.

1393
01:30:19,894 --> 01:30:23,352
A pretty car like this
ain't got no eight-track!

1394
01:30:23,465 --> 01:30:27,060
I put an eight-track in. Gon' be real nice
for y'all to listen to on the way home.

1395
01:30:27,168 --> 01:30:29,068
Look at Dorothy.
Look at Dorothy.

1396
01:30:29,170 --> 01:30:33,300
Girl, if you don't look like a free case
of motor oil... 30-weight.

1397
01:30:33,441 --> 01:30:36,410
All right, I told you
about coveting my wife, now.

1398
01:30:44,986 --> 01:30:47,614
Hey, Destiny,
where's Sir Barks-A-Lot?

1399
01:30:47,722 --> 01:30:50,520
He doesn't need me anymore.
He's gonna stay in Missouri.

1400
01:30:50,625 --> 01:30:53,025
He'll be okay.

1401
01:30:53,128 --> 01:30:55,619
I'm sure he will, sweetie.

1402
01:30:55,730 --> 01:30:59,530
Nate, did you really mean
all the things you said...

1403
01:30:59,634 --> 01:31:01,465
about supporting my dreams?

1404
01:31:01,569 --> 01:31:03,469
Every word.

1405
01:31:03,571 --> 01:31:05,630
Oh, baby. Mmm!

1406
01:31:37,305 --> 01:31:39,205
Goodness!

1407
01:31:39,307 --> 01:31:41,298
Oh, boy.

1408
01:31:41,409 --> 01:31:43,309
- Home, sweet home, huh?
- Yes.!

1409
01:31:43,411 --> 01:31:45,845
I cannot wait to change these clothes
and take a shower.

1410
01:31:45,947 --> 01:31:48,074
I wasn't gonna say nothin',
but, whoa!

1411
01:31:48,183 --> 01:31:50,515
- Come on, guys. Inside.
- It's all up here.

1412
01:31:50,618 --> 01:31:52,415
We gon' do it again.
I tell you...

1413
01:31:55,790 --> 01:31:57,951
- Oh, Daddy, our car!
- Ohh!

1414
01:31:59,928 --> 01:32:02,192
Oh, Earl! Come on, Earl!

1415
01:32:03,865 --> 01:32:06,561
31 0 will never
take this truck back now.

1416
01:32:06,668 --> 01:32:11,264
Oh, Nate, stop worrying about the truck.
You've got more important work to do.

1417
01:32:11,372 --> 01:32:15,035
After all, it's been... three months.

1418
01:32:16,244 --> 01:32:19,213
You serious, Dorothy?
Huh!

1419
01:32:19,347 --> 01:32:22,248
- You serious?
- Ninety days!

1420
01:32:23,284 --> 01:32:25,184
Uh, Nate gon' play!

1421
01:32:25,286 --> 01:32:28,084
Yea-eah! Open the door!

1422
01:36:20,588 --> 01:36:23,489
Ain't that the girl?
Ain't that the only girl?

1423
01:36:23,591 --> 01:36:25,491
She a pretty girl.

1424
01:36:25,593 --> 01:36:27,493
- Girl, you as pretty as paneling.
- Ohh.!

1425
01:36:27,595 --> 01:36:29,495
Pretty as wood paneling.

1426
01:36:29,597 --> 01:36:31,997
And, Dorothy,
you know you ain't changed.

1427
01:36:32,100 --> 01:36:35,001
You just as pretty as...
Look at you.! Lord, have mercy.!

1428
01:36:35,103 --> 01:36:37,003
Ooh, you just draw me in.!

1429
01:36:37,105 --> 01:36:41,439
Dorothy, I tell you... I tell you, girl,
you know, you is gorgeous.!
