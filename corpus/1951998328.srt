ABOUT VALERIE WHEATON?

535
00:29:45,240 --> 00:29:46,880
NO. I NEVER REALLY
SPOKE TO HER.

536
00:29:46,880 --> 00:29:48,440
I MEAN, THE MOST
I CAN TELL YOU

537
00:29:48,440 --> 00:29:52,080
IS THAT SHE TOOK
STAIRS 2 AT A TIME,

538
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:54,760
AND SHE WAS KIND
OF A NOI--

539
00:29:54,760 --> 00:29:56,560
SHE WAS...WHAT?

540
00:29:57,720 --> 00:30:00,120
SHE WAS A NOISY LOVER.

541
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:02,520
OH. NOISY LOVER, HUH?

542
00:30:02,520 --> 00:30:03,480
YEAH.

543
00:30:03,480 --> 00:30:06,000
DID SHE HAVE A BOYFRIEND
THAT YOU KNOW?

544
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,000
YEAH, SHE DID.

545
00:30:07,000 --> 00:30:08,800
WAS THIS ONE GUY,
OR A LOT OF GUYS?

546
00:30:08,800 --> 00:30:10,200
NO. ONE GUY.

547
00:30:10,200 --> 00:30:11,160
HOW DO YOU KNOW?

548
00:30:11,160 --> 00:30:12,840
I COULD HEAR HIM.

549
00:30:12,840 --> 00:30:16,000
OK. YOU GOT
A NAME ON HIM?

550
00:30:16,000 --> 00:30:17,720
OH, BABY.

551
00:30:20,280 --> 00:30:24,840
OH, BABY? OK.

552
00:30:26,040 --> 00:30:28,440
COULD YOU GO OVER
FOR ME ONE MORE TIME

553
00:30:28,440 --> 00:30:31,560
EXACTLY WHAT HAPPENED
WHEN YOU OPENED THE DOOR?

554
00:30:31,560 --> 00:30:33,600
I LOOKED OUT,

555
00:30:33,600 --> 00:30:36,200
BUT I COULDN'T SEE
VERY WELL BECAUSE OF--

556
00:30:36,200 --> 00:30:40,400

YOU'RE DRINKING WINE, RIGHT.

557
00:30:40,400 --> 00:30:41,800
AND?

558
00:30:41,800 --> 00:30:43,600
WELL, I HEARD BREATHING,

559
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:46,800
AND THEN I SAID,
"MR. CUCHETTO?"

560
00:30:46,800 --> 00:30:49,160
AND HE SAID "YES,"
BUT IT WASN'T CUCHETTO,

561
00:30:49,160 --> 00:30:51,800
'CAUSE HIS WIFE VERIFIES
THAT HE WAS SLEEPING.

562
00:30:51,800 --> 00:30:53,160

RECOGNIZE STRAIGHT OFF

563
00:30:53,160 --> 00:30:55,040
THAT IT WASN'T THE
BUILDING MANAGER'S VOICE?

564
00:30:55,040 --> 00:30:56,720
WELL, HE WHISPERED.

565
00:30:58,840 --> 00:31:00,160
HE WHISPERED?

566
00:31:00,160 --> 00:31:01,120
YEAH.

00:31:02,160 --> 00:31:03,320

POLICE WORK OR FUCKING?

578
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:45,640

A WEIRD SMELL.

IS THAT IT
ON THE SMELLS?

602

WELL, THERE WAS
SOMETHING ELSE. I--

603
00:32:36,160 --> 00:32:38,360
I'M PROBABLY
JUST IMAGINING IT--

604

WHY DON'T YOU
TELL ME ANYWAY?

01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:11,800
LONG NIGHT,

1407
01:20:36,720 --> 01:20:39,240
HOSPITAL BILLS.

1408
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,800
YOU GOT A FILE FOR EVERY
NOSEBLEED IN ILLINOIS?

1409
01:20:41,800 --> 01:20:43,720
IF YOU'LL JUST
BE PATIENT...

1410
01:20:43,720 --> 01:20:44,800
THANK YOU.

1411
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,840

1412
01:20:49,840 --> 01:20:51,560
YES.

1413
01:20:51,560 --> 01:20:55,120
MISS BRODY LIVES
IN APARTMENT 2B.

1414
01:20:55,120 --> 01:20:57,360
SOMEBODY MADE
A MISTAKE.

1415
01:20:57,360 --> 01:20:58,640
THAT'S RIGHT.

1416
01:20:59,920 --> 01:21:02,800

IN APARTMENT 3B.

TO THESE FILES?

1418

1420
01:21:09,480 --> 01:21:10,920
ALL RIGHT.

THE HANDWRITING ON THIS?

1422
01:21:15,720 --> 01:21:16,920

DR. PIERCE'S WRITING.

TO KNOW?

1427
01:21:27,320 --> 01:21:30,120

WITH DETECTIVE HALLSTROM?

1428
01:21:30,120 --> 01:21:31,960

CORRECT YOU TO 20/50.

I SAW THE KILLER?

1437
01:21:56,160 --> 01:21:58,040
SEEING ISN'T SOMETHING
THAT HAPPENS TO YOU, EMMA.

1438
01:21:58,040 --> 01:21:59,760
IT'S SOMETHING YOU DO.
I GAVE YOU THE EQUIPMENT.

1439
01:21:59,760 --> 01:22:01,320

TO CONTROL IT.

IF YOU INVENT THESE VISIONS,
YOU CAN STOP THEM.

1441
01:22:09,440 --> 01:22:12,000
DO YOU THINK
I INVENTED HIM?

1442
01:22:12,000 --> 01:22:14,320

WHAT I THINK.

WHAT'S THE PROBLEM?

1456
01:23:00,120 --> 01:23:02,000
I HAVE TO TELL HIM
SOMETHING.

1457
01:23:02,000 --> 01:23:04,120
I'M EXPECTING JOHN
ANY MINUTE.

1458
01:23:04,120 --> 01:23:05,720
THERE'S BEEN
ANOTHER MURDER.

1459
01:23:05,720 --> 01:23:06,960
IN INDIANA.

1460
01:23:08,920 --> 01:23:11,080

1461
01:23:11,080 --> 01:23:13,560
IS THERE SOMETHING

01:23:14,840 --> 01:23:15,920
NO.

1463
01:23:17,880 --> 01:23:19,240
NO, NOTHING.

1464
01:23:30,520 --> 01:23:32,440
THE SMELL
ON THE KILLER'S HANDS--

1465
01:23:32,440 --> 01:23:33,480
IT'S SURGICAL SOAP.

1466
01:23:33,480 --> 01:23:35,000
HE MUST TAKE IT
WITH HIM.

1467
01:23:35,000 --> 01:23:37,280
HE WASHES HIS HANDS
WITH SURGICAL SOAP

1468
01:23:37,280 --> 01:23:39,080
TO GET RID OF THE BLOOD.

1469
01:23:39,080 --> 01:23:40,360
I DON'T LIKE THIS.

THE MAN HAS KILLED
3 PEOPLE.

1477
01:23:54,960 --> 01:23:57,200
HAD A KIDNEY TRANSPLANT
2 MONTHS AGO.

1478

SO?

1479
01:23:58,280 --> 01:23:59,600
OUR VICTIM--
NINA GETZ--

1480
01:23:59,600 --> 01:24:01,520
HAD SKIN GRAFTS FROM
AN ORGAN DONOR

1481
01:24:01,520 --> 01:24:02,920
ABOUT 2 MONTHS AGO.

1482
01:24:02,920 --> 01:24:05,120
VALERIE WHEATON
NEVER HAD A TRANSPLANT.

1483
01:24:05,120 --> 01:24:07,360
NO, BUT THE WOMAN
WHO LIVED BELOW HER DID.

1484
01:24:07,360 --> 01:24:09,280
EMMA BRODY--SHE HAD
A CORNEAL TRANSPLANT,

1485
01:24:09,280 --> 01:24:10,560
AND, IT TURNS OUT,

1486
01:24:10,560 --> 01:24:13,040
HER APARTMENT NUMBER
IS LISTED INCORRECTLY

1487
01:24:13,040 --> 01:24:15,600
ON HER MEDICAL RECORDS.

1488
01:24:15,600 --> 01:24:18,960

TO KILL EMMA BRODY.

CHURCH, WORK, OR SOMETHING,

AND HE'S OBSESSED
WITH HER?

1496
01:24:35,440 --> 01:24:38,000
BUT SHE DIES.
SHE DONATES HER ORGANS,

1497
01:24:38,000 --> 01:24:41,320
AND HE GOES AFTER
THE PEOPLE THAT HAVE THEM.

BE PASSED ON AGAIN.

CRUMBLES *

1752
01:39:55,040 --> 01:39:57,200
* IF I LET YOU INSIDE ME *

1753
01:39:57,200 --> 01:39:59,600
* WILL YOU STAY FOR LONG? *

1754
01:39:59,600 --> 01:40:01,600
* THE ONE AND ONLY *

1755
01:40:01,600 --> 01:40:03,760
* WHILE THE GRAY WALL
CRUMBLES *

1756
01:40:03,760 --> 01:40:06,080
* WHEN YOU'RE AN OLD LADY *

1757
01:40:06,080 --> 01:40:08,200
* AND I'M STILL AROUND *

1758
01:40:08,200 --> 01:40:11,040
* WE'LL MAKE LOVE IN RUINS *

1759
01:40:11,040 --> 01:40:15,520
* MAKE LOVE IN THE STRAND *
