00:01:38,136 --> 00:01:39,186
[birds calling]

00:01:44,169 --> 00:01:45,339
[water splashing]

3
00:02:04,101 --> 00:02:06,211
Hervé Joncour:
Steaming water.

4
00:02:14,296 --> 00:02:15,286
Strange trees.

5
00:02:25,905 --> 00:02:27,135
Laughing children.

6
00:02:34,852 --> 00:02:35,662
Her skin...

7
00:02:41,384 --> 00:02:42,194
those eyes.

8
00:02:49,249 --> 00:02:50,299
[pouring water]

9
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:26,700
Hervé:
Why should I tell you about it?

10
00:03:28,405 --> 00:03:29,035
Why now?

11
00:03:32,565 --> 00:03:35,185
Maybe I just need
to tell someone...

12
00:03:36,685 --> 00:03:38,125
and maybe it's you.

13
00:03:43,967 --> 00:03:46,587
I guess it all began
when I came back home

14
00:03:46,588 --> 00:03:48,388
on leave from the army...

15
00:03:49,459 --> 00:03:51,199
when I first saw Helene.

16
00:03:51,249 --> 00:03:54,069
[hooves clacking
on cobblestones outside]

17
00:03:54,536 --> 00:03:56,766
[insects buzzing,
birds singing]

18
00:03:58,364 --> 00:04:00,344
Helene:
When are you going?

19
00:04:00,902 --> 00:04:02,122
I leave Thursday.

20
00:04:04,731 --> 00:04:06,641
And when will you be back?

21
00:04:12,928 --> 00:04:15,049
Helene: One day, I'll have
a whole garden of these--

22
00:04:15,050 --> 00:04:16,400
hundreds, thousands.

23
00:04:17,047 --> 00:04:19,626
Hervé: To make her happy,
I would have knelt down

24
00:04:19,627 --> 00:04:21,581
and started planting
a garden that very day.

25
00:04:21,582 --> 00:04:22,752
[Helene laughing]

26
00:04:23,372 --> 00:04:23,652
Oh.

27
00:04:25,993 --> 00:04:28,364
Hervé: But I had
a military career to pursue.

28
00:04:28,365 --> 00:04:30,195
My father insisted.
[Helene laughing]

29
00:04:30,196 --> 00:04:32,692
[clock chiming]
Mayor Joncour: Things are
heating up in Austria.

30
00:04:32,693 --> 00:04:35,763
I think it will come
to a head by summer.

31
00:04:35,772 --> 00:04:37,582
The outcome is inevitable.

32
00:04:38,352 --> 00:04:39,683
They won't know what to do when

33
00:04:39,684 --> 00:04:41,056
they're faced with
our military forces.

34
00:04:41,057 --> 00:04:44,207
They will crumble like
a stale linzer torte.

35
00:04:45,633 --> 00:04:48,373
Mayor Joncour:
What do you think, son?

36
00:04:49,129 --> 00:04:50,289
More fish, dear?

37
00:04:50,543 --> 00:04:53,247
Mayor Joncour:
The Austrians are fools, hmm?

38
00:04:53,248 --> 00:04:55,370
I remember,
when I was in the military,

39
00:04:55,371 --> 00:04:57,200
Hervé: I couldn't stop thinking about her.
We used to say that

40
00:04:57,201 --> 00:04:59,697
if the Austrian's ever
decided to attack,

41
00:04:59,698 --> 00:05:01,438
we'd finish our lunch...

42
00:05:01,904 --> 00:05:05,584
Hervé: Then, someone came along
to solve my problem.

43
00:05:05,690 --> 00:05:07,190
Man: Can I help you?

44
00:05:07,646 --> 00:05:08,516
Please, sir!

45
00:05:08,686 --> 00:05:10,316
[door slams into wall]

46
00:05:11,723 --> 00:05:12,680
I'm sorry, your honor.

47
00:05:12,681 --> 00:05:13,951
You may leave us.

48
00:05:14,927 --> 00:05:16,507
What can I do for you,
Baldabiou?

49
00:05:16,508 --> 00:05:18,188
You know
what this is?

50
00:05:21,003 --> 00:05:22,043
Woman's stuff.

51
00:05:22,084 --> 00:05:22,544
Wrong.

52
00:05:23,874 --> 00:05:25,834
It's money, a man's stuff.

53
00:05:28,368 --> 00:05:28,888
Really?

54
00:05:30,240 --> 00:05:31,612
And why do I need to hear this?

55
00:05:31,613 --> 00:05:33,360
I'm going to repair the silk mill.

56
00:05:33,361 --> 00:05:34,821
[chuckling] The mill?

57
00:05:35,067 --> 00:05:36,481
Where will you find the money?

58
00:05:36,482 --> 00:05:37,812
That's my problem.

59
00:05:38,563 --> 00:05:41,343
Just make sure no one
gets in my way.

60
00:05:43,556 --> 00:05:45,302
Hervé: Baldabiou repaired
the old silk mill in six months,

61
00:05:45,303 --> 00:05:46,823
Baldabiou: be careful.

62
00:05:48,049 --> 00:05:49,922
or so I was told,
as I was still in the army.

63
00:05:49,923 --> 00:05:50,503
Careful.

64
00:05:53,043 --> 00:05:56,193
By the time I returned
the following year...

65
00:05:57,911 --> 00:05:59,117
there were three more mills...

66
00:05:59,118 --> 00:05:59,988
[cow mooing]

67
00:06:01,033 --> 00:06:04,152
and more money than our town
had ever seen.

68
00:06:04,153 --> 00:06:05,359
Baldabiou:
You know what that is?

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:06,607
Mayor Joncour: Money.

70
00:06:06,608 --> 00:06:09,218
Wrong. It's proof
that I was right.

71
00:06:10,727 --> 00:06:11,787
Congratulations.

72
00:06:13,141 --> 00:06:14,804
And what do you
want me to do now?

73
00:06:14,805 --> 00:06:18,405
Nothing. You'll be the mayor
of a very rich town.

74
00:06:30,617 --> 00:06:31,837
Marry me, Helene.

75
00:06:38,399 --> 00:06:40,579
[conversation,
children playing]

76
00:06:41,811 --> 00:06:42,751
[conversation]

77
00:06:51,506 --> 00:06:52,587
[Baldabiou groans]

78
00:06:52,588 --> 00:06:54,108
[billiard balls clack]

79
00:06:54,710 --> 00:06:56,230
Hervé:
Mr. Baldabiou.

80
00:06:56,249 --> 00:06:56,709
Hervé.

81
00:06:57,955 --> 00:07:00,118
I hear you would
like to speak with me.

82
00:07:00,119 --> 00:07:01,449
Yes, but not here.

83
00:07:03,365 --> 00:07:04,285
Do you play?

84
00:07:04,572 --> 00:07:05,142
Uh, no.

85
00:07:05,821 --> 00:07:06,391
Why me?

86
00:07:08,234 --> 00:07:10,724
I need a young man,
a clever man.

87
00:07:11,895 --> 00:07:14,445
Yes, but I'm
not looking for work.

88
00:07:15,266 --> 00:07:17,304
It's not work I'm offering you.

89
00:07:17,305 --> 00:07:19,095
I'm offering you a life.

90
00:07:20,842 --> 00:07:22,796
A strange illness
has entered into the sheds.

91
00:07:22,797 --> 00:07:24,794
Half the silkworms
are either sick or dead.

92
00:07:24,795 --> 00:07:26,000
It's the same in Lyon,

93
00:07:26,001 --> 00:07:28,455
The same everywhere,
as far as Turkey.

94
00:07:28,456 --> 00:07:29,316
What is it?

95
00:07:29,705 --> 00:07:32,367
Nobody knows,
but the clock is ticking.

96
00:07:32,368 --> 00:07:34,613
We cannot solve the problem,
but we can get round it.

97
00:07:34,614 --> 00:07:37,824
We have to. Otherwise,
this town will starve.

98
00:07:38,152 --> 00:07:41,112
I need you to go
and get healthy eggs...

99
00:07:41,771 --> 00:07:42,521
In Africa.

100
00:07:47,306 --> 00:07:47,826
Africa?

101
00:07:54,047 --> 00:07:55,669
Hervé:
I wish I could,

102
00:07:55,670 --> 00:07:57,874
but my--my leave is up
in two days.

103
00:07:57,875 --> 00:08:00,579
Uh, I have to return
to the barracks.

104
00:08:00,580 --> 00:08:01,500
Who says so?

105
00:08:02,619 --> 00:08:03,369
My father.

106
00:08:03,701 --> 00:08:04,571
Your father?

107
00:08:06,239 --> 00:08:07,909
I'll take care of him.

108
00:08:09,193 --> 00:08:10,440
[priest reciting
benediction in Latin]

109
00:08:10,441 --> 00:08:11,771
Hervé: And he did.

110
00:08:13,937 --> 00:08:15,687
<I>Priest: In nomine patris,

111
00:08:16,017 --> 00:08:16,707
<I>Et filii,

112
00:08:17,931 --> 00:08:19,271
<I>Et spiritus sancti.

113
00:08:19,805 --> 00:08:21,785
Altar boy: Amen.
All: Amen.

114
00:08:24,839 --> 00:08:28,989
[applause]
Hervé: Two weeks later,
I gave up my uniform...

115
00:08:31,538 --> 00:08:33,388
and I started a new life.

116
00:08:39,653 --> 00:08:42,623
I thought love
would always be that easy.

117
00:08:49,098 --> 00:08:51,138
Hervé:
What are you writing?

118
00:08:52,510 --> 00:08:53,090
Nothing.

119
00:08:53,550 --> 00:08:54,130
Nothing?

120
00:09:07,032 --> 00:09:09,072
I just spoke
with Baldabiou.

121
00:09:13,274 --> 00:09:15,364
I leave a week from tomorrow.

122
00:09:22,096 --> 00:09:22,786
How long?

123
00:09:24,799 --> 00:09:25,379
Weeks...

124
00:09:27,629 --> 00:09:28,559
Maybe months.

125
00:09:36,118 --> 00:09:37,158
Make it weeks.

126
00:09:38,449 --> 00:09:39,439
[wind blowing]

127
00:09:40,778 --> 00:09:44,328
Hervé: That was 1862,
the year of the Great Snow.

128
00:09:46,188 --> 00:09:48,848
I set off to Egypt
to get the eggs.

129
00:09:49,308 --> 00:09:51,858
It took me a month
to find them...

130
00:09:53,927 --> 00:09:55,424
and a little less to come back.

131
00:09:55,425 --> 00:09:57,005
[steam engine thumping]

132
00:09:58,504 --> 00:10:01,814
I knew nothing about silk
or how it was made.

133
00:10:02,167 --> 00:10:03,547
All I new was that

134
00:10:04,288 --> 00:10:06,659
I had to keep those tiny eggs
away from heat,

135
00:10:06,660 --> 00:10:07,820
keep them clean,

136
00:10:08,991 --> 00:10:10,612
and bring them back
before they'd hatched.

137
00:10:10,613 --> 00:10:12,763
[chuckles]
That's all I knew.

138
00:10:14,233 --> 00:10:15,689
But back at the village,

139
00:10:15,690 --> 00:10:18,476
[baby crying]
someone else was about to hatch--

140
00:10:18,477 --> 00:10:19,527
Ludovic Berbek.

141
00:10:21,016 --> 00:10:24,796
Beatrice was so proud
to show off her baby that day.

142
00:10:40,448 --> 00:10:40,908
[sigh]

143
00:10:43,402 --> 00:10:45,502
[whispering]
Give me a child.

144
00:10:54,014 --> 00:10:55,534
[deep, excited breath]

145
00:10:56,468 --> 00:10:59,108
[men conversing,
billiard balls clack]

146
00:11:00,920 --> 00:11:01,560
[snoring]

147
00:11:07,121 --> 00:11:08,221
How was Africa?

148
00:11:10,158 --> 00:11:11,572
We never talked about it.
[billiard balls clack]

149
00:11:11,573 --> 00:11:12,793
It was beautiful.

150
00:11:13,654 --> 00:11:15,994
Tired, but...
but very beautiful.

151
00:11:19,479 --> 00:11:20,689
I have bad news.

152
00:11:22,225 --> 00:11:23,615
I found dead worms.

153
00:11:24,639 --> 00:11:27,019
Only a few, but, still, too many.

154
00:11:27,843 --> 00:11:31,295
Baldabiou: Seems the pébrine got
to Egypt before you did.

155
00:11:31,296 --> 00:11:32,346
Hervé: pébrine?

156
00:11:35,915 --> 00:11:38,475
Baldabiou:
They've given it a name.

157
00:11:42,198 --> 00:11:44,158
I need you to go to Japan.

158
00:11:45,444 --> 00:11:45,904
Japan?

159
00:11:48,440 --> 00:11:49,480
Where is that?

160
00:11:49,606 --> 00:11:50,696
It's that way.

161
00:11:51,145 --> 00:11:52,725
Baldabiou: Just keep going
to the end of the world.

162
00:11:52,726 --> 00:11:54,390
[lays down cue]
Let me show you.

163
00:11:54,391 --> 00:11:57,131
They make the most
perfect silk there.

164
00:11:57,137 --> 00:11:59,175
I held some in my hand once.

165
00:11:59,176 --> 00:12:01,089
It was like holding nothing.

166
00:12:01,090 --> 00:12:03,378
They've been making silk for over
a thousand years,

167
00:12:03,379 --> 00:12:06,809
and they've never even heard
of a diseased egg.

168
00:12:08,288 --> 00:12:10,958
It'll be a longer journey
this time.

169
00:12:12,325 --> 00:12:13,965
Baldabiou:
Much longer.

170
00:12:16,902 --> 00:12:18,274
Before I speak to the others,

171
00:12:18,275 --> 00:12:21,405
I have to know that
you're ready for this.

172
00:12:24,308 --> 00:12:26,518
Baldabiou:
But there's a risk.

173
00:12:26,555 --> 00:12:28,885
The journey's long and dangerous,

174
00:12:29,552 --> 00:12:32,005
And it's forbidden to travel
inland beyond Japan's harbors.

175
00:12:32,006 --> 00:12:33,254
No Westerner has done it.

176
00:12:33,255 --> 00:12:34,525
And, yet, a place

177
00:12:34,670 --> 00:12:36,915
where no English broker
or Chinese trader can go

178
00:12:36,916 --> 00:12:39,538
is a place where no
disease can enter.

179
00:12:39,539 --> 00:12:41,659
And why should we succeed
where others have failed?

180
00:12:41,660 --> 00:12:43,116
<I>Baldabiou: There's no evidence
that we will succeed,

181
00:12:43,117 --> 00:12:44,864
But I have it from

That the Japanese are trading
their silk on the black market.

183
00:12:47,652 --> 00:12:50,689
We're interested in making silk,
not buying it.

184
00:12:50,690 --> 00:12:54,142
I want to send Hervé
to trade for eggs, not silk.

185
00:12:54,143 --> 00:12:56,473
But there's still no guarantee,
no matter how good the plan.

186
00:12:56,474 --> 00:12:57,164
How much?

187
00:12:58,055 --> 00:12:59,735
At best, 10,000 francs.

188
00:13:02,008 --> 00:13:02,988
And at worst?

I can't do this.

192
00:13:20,067 --> 00:13:20,987
I cannot go.

193
00:13:23,312 --> 00:13:27,502
But you've already said you would go.
I wasn't thinking...

194
00:13:27,931 --> 00:13:28,621
about us.

195
00:13:31,552 --> 00:13:35,082
I don't want you to give
this up because of me.

196
00:13:35,338 --> 00:13:39,408
It's better than you going off
to fight some stupid war.

197
00:13:43,702 --> 00:13:45,552
You'll be back by spring.

198
00:14:02,718 --> 00:14:03,698
Don't forget.

199
00:14:04,507 --> 00:14:07,045
My Japanese contact will
meet you in Vladivostok.

200
00:14:07,046 --> 00:14:09,196
Yes.
And her letters for him.

201
00:14:10,458 --> 00:14:12,120
He'll help you find
the village.

202
00:14:12,121 --> 00:14:14,576
All you have to do
is bring back the eggs.

Three thousand miles
of ice and storm.

220
00:15:54,234 --> 00:15:57,204
I had my Christmas dinner
at Lake Baikal,

221
00:15:57,272 --> 00:15:59,132
And I thought of Helene...

222
00:15:59,769 --> 00:16:00,289
always.

223
00:16:03,930 --> 00:16:06,426

227
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:20,330
Where a Japanese guide
handed me my disguise.

And for the next three days,

Well, first,
he stopped talking.

364
00:31:04,344 --> 00:31:08,244
Then one day, he woke up,
packed a suitcase, and left.

365
00:31:10,337 --> 00:31:12,332
Beatrice was about to have Ludovic.

366
00:31:12,333 --> 00:31:13,953
That was quite a blow.

367
00:31:22,444 --> 00:31:25,440
But why did he stop talking
in the first place?

368
00:31:25,441 --> 00:31:29,102
That's one of the many things
he never talked about.

369
00:31:29,103 --> 00:31:29,383
Hm.

370
00:31:31,516 --> 00:31:32,496
No, no, Papa.

371
00:31:33,222 --> 00:31:33,562
Mmm!

372
00:31:40,712 --> 00:31:42,822
[Beatrice singing in distance]

373
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:48,990
Do you think about it?

374
00:31:53,652 --> 00:31:54,352
Sometimes.

375
00:31:58,022 --> 00:31:59,232
What do you see?

376
00:32:06,094 --> 00:32:07,204
Strange trees...

377
00:32:10,671 --> 00:32:14,011
chickens pecking in the dirt,
laughing children.

378
00:32:15,789 --> 00:32:17,239
What about this man?

379
00:32:17,954 --> 00:32:19,584
You hardly mention him.

380
00:32:24,029 --> 00:32:25,189
He was closed...

381
00:32:27,565 --> 00:32:28,265
secretive.

382
00:32:34,265 --> 00:32:36,636
It's hard to remember
all of it. It...

383
00:32:36,637 --> 00:32:37,907
it's fading away.

384
00:32:41,215 --> 00:32:42,205
Ludovic: Papa!

385
00:32:46,000 --> 00:32:47,520
Ludovic, crying: Papa!

386
00:32:47,706 --> 00:32:51,136
I've ask Madame Berbek
to help with the chores.

387
00:32:51,326 --> 00:32:53,466
The house is too much for me.

388
00:32:54,946 --> 00:32:56,386
That's a good idea.

389
00:32:57,942 --> 00:33:01,152
Ludovic is growing.
They must need the money.

390
00:33:03,850 --> 00:33:05,590
I knew you'd understand.

391
00:33:07,679 --> 00:33:08,479
May I see?

392
00:33:09,509 --> 00:33:11,006
No, it's not finished.

393
00:33:11,007 --> 00:33:13,677
I want to look at it.
No. [laughing]

394
00:33:27,276 --> 00:33:30,126
Hervé:
It was a happy time that summer.

395
00:33:30,856 --> 00:33:32,256
[watch cover clicks]

396
00:33:36,223 --> 00:33:37,928
Hervé: Life was simple again.
Helene: Opened his beak...

397
00:33:37,929 --> 00:33:39,199
and he felt sick.

398
00:33:39,469 --> 00:33:41,849
The cheese fell
out of his beak,

399
00:33:42,256 --> 00:33:44,835
and the fox caught the cheese,
and ran off with it.

400
00:33:44,836 --> 00:33:47,375
So this is the path,
and the fountain is there.

401
00:33:47,376 --> 00:33:49,116
Mm-hmm.
And the lilies?

402
00:33:50,412 --> 00:33:51,410
You're standing on them.

403
00:33:51,411 --> 00:33:52,931
[laughing]
Oh. Sorry.

404
00:33:54,990 --> 00:33:56,612
You're standing on them again.

405
00:33:56,613 --> 00:33:57,860
So the lilies are everywhere.

406
00:33:57,861 --> 00:34:00,321
[laughs] The lilies
are everywhere.

407
00:34:12,549 --> 00:34:13,999
Hervé: But I knew...

408
00:34:15,379 --> 00:34:18,109
I knew that it couldn't
last forever.

409
00:34:20,622 --> 00:34:21,672
Hervé: Ludovic?

410
00:34:22,245 --> 00:34:23,450
Baldabiou: I suppose
we won't be eating

411
00:34:23,451 --> 00:34:25,381
<I>your aubergines this summer.

412
00:34:25,865 --> 00:34:27,944
<I>Hervé: It's a flower garden,
not a potager.

413
00:34:27,945 --> 00:34:29,765
[chuckles]
Hello, Ludovic.

414
00:34:33,770 --> 00:34:36,330
I've received some news
from Japan.

415
00:34:40,387 --> 00:34:43,465
It may not be so easy to get in
and out the next time.

416
00:34:43,466 --> 00:34:44,736
When was it easy?

417
00:34:46,047 --> 00:34:48,542
Hervé: I have
Hara Jubei's protection.

418
00:34:48,543 --> 00:34:49,693
I will be fine.

419
00:34:50,207 --> 00:34:52,747
What if you don't
make it to him?

420
00:34:55,284 --> 00:34:55,864
Hervé...

421
00:34:58,654 --> 00:35:00,064
Baldabiou:
Listen...

422
00:35:01,484 --> 00:35:03,514
you have a decision to make.

423
00:35:10,139 --> 00:35:11,059
You make it.

424
00:35:14,341 --> 00:35:15,391
[clock ticking]

425
00:35:44,342 --> 00:35:45,902
I'll always love you.

426
00:35:48,379 --> 00:35:50,409
Hervé: I'll always love you.

427
00:36:23,748 --> 00:36:24,498
<I>Au revoir!

428
00:36:26,660 --> 00:36:26,940
Oh.

Hervé: And once again,
I made it to the village.

438
00:38:01,533 --> 00:38:03,031
Only this time,
it was different.

439
00:38:03,032 --> 00:38:06,172
This time, I was
not treated as a stranger.

440
00:38:06,693 --> 00:38:08,453

441
00:38:09,856 --> 00:38:11,956

Hervé: I had to find her.

448
00:39:06,155 --> 00:39:09,358
So while I waited for the eggs
to be prepared,

449
00:39:09,359 --> 00:39:10,989
I searched the village.

I wanted you to see this place.

Join me.

459
00:40:39,820 --> 00:40:40,777
Perhaps another time.

can you see them.

You are, uh, French,
I suppose.

What is your trade?

480
00:44:26,807 --> 00:44:28,304
There is no point
in being secretive.

481
00:44:28,305 --> 00:44:31,505
You're either here to buy
or sell something.

482
00:44:31,592 --> 00:44:32,512
Which is it?

483
00:44:33,631 --> 00:44:35,253
I'm here to buy silk eggs.

Mmm!

491
00:44:46,489 --> 00:44:48,194
You must be paying
pretty well.

492
00:44:48,195 --> 00:44:52,285
Hara Jubei has never offered me
anything like this before.

493
00:44:53,271 --> 00:44:55,651
Do not be fooled by his kindness.

losing grip.

508
00:45:36,713 --> 00:45:38,376
I'd be on my guard,
if I were you.

509
00:45:38,377 --> 00:45:39,542
Is that a warning?

hoping she might return.

548
00:52:38,895 --> 00:52:39,815
She did not.

549
00:52:56,122 --> 00:52:57,286
[man shouting in Japanese]

550
00:52:57,287 --> 00:52:59,967
Hervé:
And, once again, I left Japan.

551
00:53:03,113 --> 00:53:06,543
This time, I had brought
back 10 boxes of eggs,

552
00:53:06,940 --> 00:53:09,270
much more than the previous trip.

553
00:53:17,010 --> 00:53:18,890
[carriage wheels clattering]

554
00:53:19,591 --> 00:53:21,531
[woman speaking indistinctly]

555
00:53:30,409 --> 00:53:32,679
Hervé:
I wanted to tell Helene.

556
00:53:35,610 --> 00:53:37,880
I wanted to tell her everything.

557
00:53:49,591 --> 00:53:50,111
Helene.

558
00:53:52,795 --> 00:53:53,195
What?

559
00:53:56,999 --> 00:53:57,859
I love you.

560
00:54:05,529 --> 00:54:07,619
Hervé:
And it tore me apart.

561
00:54:10,355 --> 00:54:11,935
[thunder, rain falling]

562
00:54:17,720 --> 00:54:18,830
[Helene gasping]

563
00:54:23,671 --> 00:54:24,661
[gasps loudly]

564
00:54:27,790 --> 00:54:28,913
[whispering]
What is it?

565
00:54:28,914 --> 00:54:30,084
[strained breath]

566
00:54:30,495 --> 00:54:31,355
What is it?

567
00:54:34,490 --> 00:54:36,840
[crickets chirping, birds singing]

568
00:55:06,946 --> 00:55:08,566
So she's not Japanese?

569
00:55:11,065 --> 00:55:12,515
No. She was Chinese.

570
00:55:16,600 --> 00:55:18,980
She was the Emperor's third wife.

571
00:55:20,719 --> 00:55:23,629
Legend has it that
she was preparing tea

572
00:55:25,338 --> 00:55:26,848
in the palace garden.

573
00:55:27,669 --> 00:55:31,529
She accidentally dropped
a cocoon into the hot water...

574
00:55:32,828 --> 00:55:34,159
and then she discovered

575
00:55:34,160 --> 00:55:37,070
that a cocoon's fibers
could be unwound,

576
00:55:38,403 --> 00:55:40,899
and a thread could
be obtained from it--

577
00:55:40,900 --> 00:55:43,700
one that was strong enough
for weaving.

578
00:55:44,812 --> 00:55:46,552
Who told you that story?

579
00:55:49,805 --> 00:55:50,495
A trader.

580
00:55:54,008 --> 00:55:54,528
[blows]

581
00:55:55,006 --> 00:55:55,866
What is it?

582
00:55:58,501 --> 00:55:59,998
You've been sitting
there for over an hour.

583
00:55:59,999 --> 00:56:01,569
Baldabiou: What is it?

584
00:56:02,246 --> 00:56:04,516
I need your help with something.

585
00:56:04,743 --> 00:56:06,553
[dogs howling in distance]

586
00:56:08,030 --> 00:56:11,151
I need to find someone
who can speak Japanese.

587
00:56:11,152 --> 00:56:12,432
Ask Hervé Joncour.

588
00:56:14,854 --> 00:56:16,594
Don't make it difficult.

589
00:56:18,100 --> 00:56:19,320
You know someone.

590
00:56:21,222 --> 00:56:24,532
Who wrote the letter I took
on my first trip?

591
00:56:25,049 --> 00:56:26,569
[billiard balls clack]

592
00:56:26,673 --> 00:56:29,113
What is it you need
to translate?

593
00:56:32,622 --> 00:56:33,142
Please.

594
00:56:37,908 --> 00:56:38,958
Madame Blanche.

595
00:56:40,819 --> 00:56:42,733
She runs a brothel in Lyon--

596
00:56:42,734 --> 00:56:44,230
Number 12, Rue Moscat.

597
00:56:44,231 --> 00:56:46,394
Men pay a lot of money
to be with her.

598
00:56:46,395 --> 00:56:47,642
Hervé:
And she speaks Japanese?

599
00:56:47,643 --> 00:56:48,803
<I>She is Japanese.

600
00:56:49,142 --> 00:56:51,471
Well, how did she wind up in Lyon?

601
00:56:51,472 --> 00:56:53,385
She married a French merchant
in Yokohama,

602
00:56:53,386 --> 00:56:55,257
He died on their return to France,

603
00:56:55,258 --> 00:56:57,288
She had to fend for herself.

604
00:57:14,191 --> 00:57:16,521
Hervé: I have to go
to Lyon tomorrow.

605
00:57:16,522 --> 00:57:18,272
[sound of Hervé writing]

606
00:57:20,849 --> 00:57:21,779
[deep breath]

607
00:57:22,929 --> 00:57:25,079
I'll be back before nightfall.

608
00:57:32,417 --> 00:57:33,397
What's wrong?

609
00:57:35,663 --> 00:57:36,183
Helene?

610
00:57:47,189 --> 00:57:48,809
We have to be patient.

611
00:57:53,597 --> 00:57:57,137
We've been trying to have
a child for two years.

612
00:57:59,672 --> 00:58:01,292
We have to try harder.

613
00:58:07,828 --> 00:58:08,748
Come to bed.

614
00:58:09,742 --> 00:58:10,142
Come.

615
00:58:15,359 --> 00:58:16,349
[bell tolling]

616
00:58:17,690 --> 00:58:19,021
[man shouting in distance]

617
00:58:19,022 --> 00:58:21,132
[bell tolls, people conversing]

618
00:58:27,343 --> 00:58:29,073
Hervé: I won't be long.

619
00:58:29,799 --> 00:58:32,679
[piano playing
woman whispering, giggling]

620
00:58:32,835 --> 00:58:34,115
[small bell rings]

621
00:58:34,792 --> 00:58:37,492
[men and women
conversing indistinctly]

622
00:58:57,761 --> 00:58:59,101
[plays final chord]

623
00:59:02,171 --> 00:59:02,631
Voilà.

624
00:59:04,127 --> 00:59:06,397
Madame Blanche will see you now.

625
00:59:11,825 --> 00:59:13,525
Madame Blanche: Please...

626
00:59:14,156 --> 00:59:14,496
sit.

627
00:59:28,470 --> 00:59:30,299
And what makes you think
you're rich enough

628
00:59:30,300 --> 00:59:31,570
to sleep with me?

629
00:59:33,837 --> 00:59:36,447
Hervé: That is not
what I came for.

630
00:59:38,289 --> 00:59:39,453
What do you want then?

631
00:59:39,454 --> 00:59:41,254
Hervé:
I need your help.

632
00:59:41,576 --> 00:59:43,086
Never mind the price.

633
00:59:45,779 --> 00:59:48,559
I need to know
what is written on it.

634
00:59:50,024 --> 00:59:51,294
Will you help me?

635
01:00:04,962 --> 01:00:07,762
Madame Blanche:
Where did you get this?

636
01:00:13,825 --> 01:00:15,795
"Come back or I shall die."

637
01:00:18,152 --> 01:00:20,472
Come back?
That's what it says.

638
01:00:21,273 --> 01:00:23,243
"Come back or I shall die."

639
01:00:33,174 --> 01:00:33,924
Thank you.

640
01:00:45,241 --> 01:00:46,401
Forget about it.

641
01:00:48,902 --> 01:00:50,702
Not the money, the woman.

642
01:00:53,106 --> 01:00:54,326
Forget about her.

643
01:00:56,892 --> 01:00:59,202
She won't die, and you know it.

644
01:01:10,332 --> 01:01:13,036
[patrons speaking]
Baldabiou: I went to see
that fellow, Pasteur.

645
01:01:13,037 --> 01:01:13,377
Yes?

646
01:01:15,284 --> 01:01:17,024
He's pretty darn clever.

647
01:01:17,740 --> 01:01:19,943
[opening bottle]
he's discovered how to isolate

648
01:01:19,944 --> 01:01:23,397
[pouring]
the infected eggs from the healthy ones.

649
01:01:23,398 --> 01:01:24,645
He can't cure them,

650
01:01:24,646 --> 01:01:26,726
but he can tell which ones are good.

651
01:01:26,727 --> 01:01:28,598
And the results are guaranteed.

652
01:01:28,599 --> 01:01:29,469
Mmm. Really?

653
01:01:33,384 --> 01:01:35,506
There's trouble again in Japan.

654
01:01:35,507 --> 01:01:37,247
This time, it's serious.

655
01:01:38,420 --> 01:01:42,700
The French Consulate in Yokohama
have been sending dispatches.

656
01:01:43,329 --> 01:01:44,829
They say it's chaos.

657
01:01:47,699 --> 01:01:50,389
And this, uh,
Italian fellow, Ferreri,

658
01:01:51,152 --> 01:01:54,812
he's come back from China
with eggs, tons of them,

659
01:01:54,981 --> 01:01:58,131
Healthy from first to last,
same with Bolée.

660
01:01:59,474 --> 01:02:01,794
They're offering us a good deal.

661
01:02:02,928 --> 01:02:04,788
Seven francs for the gram.

662
01:02:05,383 --> 01:02:07,123
And they'll insure them.

663
01:02:07,755 --> 01:02:09,460
And with the work
that Pasteur is doing,

664
01:02:09,461 --> 01:02:10,583
we might get by on our own.

665
01:02:10,584 --> 01:02:11,804
[sets down glass]

666
01:02:12,415 --> 01:02:15,145
It would be madness
to go back there.

667
01:02:15,412 --> 01:02:16,562
It's too risky.

668
01:02:19,240 --> 01:02:21,610
I don't want to lose you, Hervé.

669
01:02:25,065 --> 01:02:27,275
I'm going to Japan,
Baldabiou.

670
01:02:29,351 --> 01:02:33,121
Even if it means I have
to pay for the trip myself.

671
01:02:33,720 --> 01:02:36,091
All you have to decide
is whether I'm...

672
01:02:36,092 --> 01:02:39,002
selling the eggs to you
or someone else.

673
01:02:41,917 --> 01:02:43,706
Mayor Joncour:
We've heard that the eggs
coming in from Turkey

674
01:02:43,707 --> 01:02:44,954
Are perfectly healthy.

675
01:02:44,955 --> 01:02:46,660
That's where
the Lyon breeders go.

676
01:02:46,661 --> 01:02:48,158
Man: The Italians, too.

677
01:02:48,159 --> 01:02:49,906
Second man: Well, then
why don't we do the same?

678
01:02:49,907 --> 01:02:51,154
Mayor Joncour: Japan is too dangerous.
Man: We can no longer

679
01:02:51,155 --> 01:02:52,819
afford the risks.
Baldabiou: Gentlemen.

680
01:02:52,820 --> 01:02:53,984
Gentlemen, please.

681
01:02:53,985 --> 01:02:55,795
These eggs are unreliable.

682
01:02:55,857 --> 01:02:58,017
The Japanese eggs are pristine.

683
01:02:58,729 --> 01:03:00,891
Who really knows
what's going on there?

684
01:03:00,892 --> 01:03:02,639
Very few people have seen it
with their own eyes,

685
01:03:02,640 --> 01:03:03,803
and one of them
lives right here.

686
01:03:03,804 --> 01:03:06,218
This is my son
you are talking about.

687
01:03:06,219 --> 01:03:07,840
He's made the voyage twice.

688
01:03:07,841 --> 01:03:09,879
If anybody understands
the dangers, he does,

689
01:03:09,880 --> 01:03:11,460
and he believes it can be done.

690
01:03:11,461 --> 01:03:14,123
Now, I, for one, am staking my
money on another trip.

691
01:03:14,124 --> 01:03:17,104
You gentlemen must
make your own decision.

692
01:03:29,187 --> 01:03:30,726
Isn't there some way
you can stop him?

693
01:03:30,727 --> 01:03:31,877
I'm afraid not.

694
01:03:35,845 --> 01:03:38,305
Baldabiou: There is
something else.

695
01:03:42,378 --> 01:03:45,528
There seems to be some trouble
over there...

696
01:03:45,957 --> 01:03:46,827
an uprising.

697
01:03:49,743 --> 01:03:51,313
It could be dangerous.

698
01:03:55,735 --> 01:03:56,941
Then I suppose all I can do

699
01:03:56,942 --> 01:03:59,432
is give him a reason to come back.

700
01:04:08,052 --> 01:04:10,102
[sheep bells clanging outside]

701
01:04:17,331 --> 01:04:18,541
You're not to...

702
01:04:20,160 --> 01:04:21,620
worry about anything.

703
01:04:22,824 --> 01:04:23,394
I know.

704
01:04:26,193 --> 01:04:26,873
I won't.

705
01:04:32,061 --> 01:04:33,142
I have protection there.

706
01:04:33,143 --> 01:04:35,053
I will...
I will be fine.

707
01:04:38,470 --> 01:04:39,700

[crows cawing]

713
01:06:15,921 --> 01:06:19,761
Hervé: This time, it really was
the end of the world.

714
01:06:20,748 --> 01:06:23,438
The rebellion
had reached the village.

715
01:06:53,828 --> 01:06:54,588
[footsteps]

716
01:06:57,824 --> 01:06:59,334
Hervé: Are you alone?

717
01:07:02,650 --> 01:07:03,630
Are you hurt?

718
01:07:11,388 --> 01:07:12,488
Where are they?

719
01:07:24,039 --> 01:07:24,849
<I>Hervé: Hai.

720
01:07:29,655 --> 01:07:30,465
<I>Hervé: Hai.

721
01:07:35,106 --> 01:07:36,266
Boy: Hara Jubei.

722
01:07:37,811 --> 01:07:39,101
[speaking Japanese]

723
01:07:41,723 --> 01:07:44,113
Take me there,
do you understand?

724
01:07:47,091 --> 01:07:48,081
[crows cawing]

725
01:08:03,194 --> 01:08:04,484

Wait.

How did you find us?

[horse neighs]

738
01:10:29,248 --> 01:10:31,578
Hara Jubei: Who brought you here?

739
01:10:32,368 --> 01:10:33,938
Hara Jubei: Answer me!

740
01:10:35,573 --> 01:10:37,485
Hara Jubei: There is nothing
for you here.

741
01:10:37,486 --> 01:10:39,566
Hara Jubei: Only war,
and it's not your war.

742
01:10:39,567 --> 01:10:41,367
War is an expensive game.

743
01:10:43,063 --> 01:10:44,563
You have need of me.

744
01:10:47,431 --> 01:10:48,470
I have need of you.

745
01:10:48,471 --> 01:10:49,927
You should not have come here.

[horse neighs]

747
01:10:50,968 --> 01:10:52,174

Hara Jubei:
Japan is an ancient country.

765
01:12:40,487 --> 01:12:42,817
Hara Jubei:
It has ancient laws.

766
01:12:43,110 --> 01:12:46,188
There are crimes here
for which it is acceptable

767
01:12:46,189 --> 01:12:48,099
to condemn a man to death.

768
01:12:48,103 --> 01:12:49,913
[man shouting in Japanese]

769
01:12:50,267 --> 01:12:52,237
This is a rifle, my friend.

770
01:12:53,845 --> 01:12:55,295
Keep your head down.

771

[man shouting in Japanese]

772
01:13:00,045 --> 01:13:02,332
The boy committed
one of those crimes

773
01:13:02,333 --> 01:13:05,744
when he carried a love message
from his mistress.

774

[chimes tinkling]

775
01:13:07,784 --> 01:13:09,704
He was carrying no message.

<I>He was the message.

777
01:13:15,773 --> 01:13:16,803

[spits]

781
01:13:31,752 --> 01:13:34,252
Now go and never return here again.

782
01:14:06,705 --> 01:14:09,325
Hervé: It took me 11 days
to reach Sakata,

783
01:14:09,326 --> 01:14:12,296
Where I finally found
four boxes of eggs.

784
01:14:13,696 --> 01:14:15,691
I packed the boxes
in crates filled with ice,

785
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:18,262
fearful that they
would hatch early.

786
01:14:19,646 --> 01:14:22,724
Hervé: I reached the Russian coast
by the end of March,

787
01:14:22,725 --> 01:14:25,405
which was one month later
than usual.

788
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,421
Hervé: Summer had
already come to Europe.

789
01:14:31,422 --> 01:14:32,472

791
01:14:41,408 --> 01:14:44,958
Hervé: And then, one morning,
I knew it was over.

792
01:14:48,275 --> 01:14:50,255
Hervé: The eggs had hatched.

793
01:14:52,102 --> 01:14:54,022
Hervé: The worms were dead.

794
01:14:55,930 --> 01:14:58,380
Hervé: Millions of them,
all dead.

Driver: Hyah!

798
01:16:00,344 --> 01:16:02,084
I thought you were dead.

799
01:16:10,789 --> 01:16:14,819
And in the whole world, there
was nothing beautiful left.

800
01:16:35,506 --> 01:16:37,956
Hervé:
That was a terrible summer.

801
01:16:42,287 --> 01:16:45,247
We had to close
three of the four mills.

802
01:16:46,614 --> 01:16:50,524
Baldabiou had to make up
stories to explain my failure.

803
01:16:52,065 --> 01:16:55,727
Hervé: And with the thought
of all that had happened...

804
01:16:55,728 --> 01:16:59,508
how I'd failed the village,
how I'd failed Helene...

805
01:17:01,886 --> 01:17:03,336
I sank into silence.

806
01:17:17,448 --> 01:17:19,488
Baldabiou:
So, here you are.

807
01:17:27,310 --> 01:17:29,700
Baldabiou:
What's wrong with you?

808
01:17:30,056 --> 01:17:32,436
You haven't come around for ages.

809
01:17:34,510 --> 01:17:35,620
Listen, Hervé...

810
01:17:37,464 --> 01:17:39,459
Sooner or later,
you're gonna have to talk to someone.

811
01:17:39,460 --> 01:17:41,190
It might as well be me.

812
01:17:42,623 --> 01:17:44,413
It might as well be now.

813
01:17:47,034 --> 01:17:48,024
What happened?

814
01:17:50,362 --> 01:17:51,992
What happened in Japan?

815
01:17:54,357 --> 01:17:55,522
There's nothing more to say.

816
01:17:55,523 --> 01:17:57,093
I told you everything.

817
01:17:57,562 --> 01:17:58,662
That's rubbish.

818
01:17:59,392 --> 01:18:01,422
There's nothing more to say.

819
01:18:18,408 --> 01:18:21,788
If things continue like this,
we'll all starve.

820
01:18:24,026 --> 01:18:24,981
Something has to be done.

821
01:18:24,982 --> 01:18:26,602
Do you have any ideas?

822
01:18:36,593 --> 01:18:37,763
Hervé: Baldabiou.

823
01:18:44,040 --> 01:18:45,600
We'll build a garden.

824
01:18:46,579 --> 01:18:49,199
I'll hire everyone
in the village...

825
01:18:49,533 --> 01:18:50,822
anyone who's
strong enough to dig--

826
01:18:50,823 --> 01:18:52,633
men, women, children, too.

827
01:18:54,735 --> 01:18:57,825
And, together, we'll
build Helene's garden.

828
01:19:00,560 --> 01:19:02,639
Hervé: We started to work
in late summer.

829
01:19:02,640 --> 01:19:03,390
Men: Whoa!

830
01:19:08,508 --> 01:19:09,921
Hervé: May I have some water?

831
01:19:09,922 --> 01:19:12,062
I don't think you're working.

832
01:19:14,500 --> 01:19:15,670
[Helene laughing]

833
01:19:18,286 --> 01:19:21,656
Hervé: And we finished
most of it by the fall.

834
01:19:23,986 --> 01:19:26,136
Helene:
You pull that one up?

835
01:19:26,150 --> 01:19:27,356
Weeds are bad for trees.

836
01:19:27,357 --> 01:19:28,770
They take their food,

837
01:19:28,771 --> 01:19:31,081
so you've got to pull them out.

838
01:19:32,475 --> 01:19:34,513
Then why do we have them
if they are bad?

839
01:19:34,514 --> 01:19:36,714
God made them to keep us busy.

840
01:19:36,886 --> 01:19:38,466
[priest speaking Latin]

841
01:19:47,704 --> 01:19:49,993

et filii,

<I>et spiritus sancti.
Hervé: So winter came, and

843
01:19:51,782 --> 01:19:53,612
everyone had enough to eat.

844
01:19:53,613 --> 01:19:54,313
[applause]

845
01:19:57,525 --> 01:19:59,625
Hervé:
Then a letter arrived.

846
01:20:01,062 --> 01:20:03,492
It took me five days
to open it.

847
01:20:05,099 --> 01:20:07,019
It was stamped in Oostende,

848
01:20:07,595 --> 01:20:10,615
but it had a Japanese seal
in the corner.

849
01:20:19,870 --> 01:20:21,780
Helene:
I'm going to bed.

850
01:20:24,447 --> 01:20:26,757
Hervé:
I'll be up in a minute.

851
01:20:34,476 --> 01:20:37,066
[carriages clattering,
people talking]

852
01:20:49,746 --> 01:20:51,536
I shall read it for you,

853
01:20:52,118 --> 01:20:54,378
but this time, I want no money.

854
01:20:56,487 --> 01:20:57,901
What I want is a promise

855
01:20:57,902 --> 01:21:00,462
that you will
never come back here.

856
01:21:03,478 --> 01:21:04,228
I promise.

857
01:21:09,470 --> 01:21:10,750
"My dear master...

858
01:21:15,462 --> 01:21:16,792

01:24:20,422 --> 01:24:23,802
Hervé: That year, in Edo,
they signed a treaty,

899
01:24:24,042 --> 01:24:26,852
authorizing the export
of silkworm eggs.

900
01:24:32,946 --> 01:24:36,736
Hervé: A few years later,
they opened the Suez Canal.

901
01:24:37,149 --> 01:24:40,809
After that, a journey to Japan
would take twenty days,

902
01:24:40,810 --> 01:24:42,490
Even less to come back.

903
01:24:44,847 --> 01:24:45,970
Hervé: A new era had begun.

[children playing]

905
01:24:49,965 --> 01:24:51,945
Hervé:
So the years passed.

906
01:24:55,541 --> 01:24:56,411
We traveled.

907
01:24:56,789 --> 01:24:59,319
[children shouting,
seagulls calling]

908
01:25:02,740 --> 01:25:05,900
Hervé: We accepted the fact that
we would not have a child.

909
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:08,651
Helene: Nine plus
seven equals sixteen.

910
01:25:12,602 --> 01:25:14,847
Now, sometimes it may seem like
numbers keep their secrets.

911
01:25:14,848 --> 01:25:16,928
Hervé: And a sort of peace
Entered our lives.

912
01:25:16,929 --> 01:25:19,258
Helene: But you have to be patient.
You have to keep trying.

913
01:25:19,259 --> 01:25:20,539
Do you understand?

914
01:25:26,000 --> 01:25:28,320
Hervé:
But it didn't last long.

915
01:25:28,996 --> 01:25:30,156
Not long enough.

916
01:25:34,030 --> 01:25:35,140
[glass shatters]

917
01:25:40,730 --> 01:25:43,060
Hervé:
Yes, but are you certain?

918
01:25:43,602 --> 01:25:46,180
Doctor: No change.
She needs to rest.

919
01:25:46,181 --> 01:25:48,802
But you've been saying that
for weeks.

920
01:25:48,803 --> 01:25:50,133
All she's been doing
is resting.

921
01:25:50,134 --> 01:25:51,994
She's just getting weaker.

922
01:25:53,088 --> 01:25:55,358
Be patient.
I am being patient!

923
01:26:26,793 --> 01:26:28,323
[wheelbarrow squeaking]

924
01:26:34,740 --> 01:26:35,697
Good day, Ludovic.

925
01:26:35,698 --> 01:26:36,918
Good day, Madame.

926
01:26:37,404 --> 01:26:38,964
Do you have a moment?

927
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:44,102
I have a favor to ask you.

928
01:26:44,103 --> 01:26:45,433
Whatever I can do.

929
01:26:48,222 --> 01:26:51,551
I would like you
to help Hervé with the garden.

930
01:26:51,552 --> 01:26:52,302
Of course.

931
01:26:56,004 --> 01:26:57,624
I mean, in the future.

932
01:27:01,163 --> 01:27:03,303
He's going to need your help.

933
01:27:07,572 --> 01:27:09,132
You can depend on me.

934
01:27:11,358 --> 01:27:11,758
Good.

935
01:27:22,219 --> 01:27:23,209
[rain falling]

936
01:27:29,417 --> 01:27:30,057
[thunder]

937
01:27:45,812 --> 01:27:48,922
[water splashing]
Hervé: Beatrice stopped by.

938
01:27:51,429 --> 01:27:52,999
She brought us dinner.

939
01:27:53,094 --> 01:27:55,814
Hm.
You'll have to thank her for me.

940
01:28:00,667 --> 01:28:03,877
Hervé: And Baldabiou
sent over a dozen quail.

941
01:28:05,577 --> 01:28:07,532
God knows where he got them.

942
01:28:07,533 --> 01:28:08,703
[Helene chuckles]

943
01:28:09,363 --> 01:28:11,873
Probably sent someone
on a journey.

944
01:28:32,125 --> 01:28:33,295
[distant thunder]

945
01:28:51,973 --> 01:28:55,301
There's things that
I haven't told you, Helene.

946
01:28:55,302 --> 01:28:56,402
Helene: I know.

947
01:28:58,464 --> 01:29:01,014
I just--I couldn't
find the words.

948
01:29:03,083 --> 01:29:04,233
It's all right.

949
01:29:06,453 --> 01:29:07,603
It's all right.

950
01:29:09,241 --> 01:29:10,001
[sniffling]

951
01:29:16,690 --> 01:29:20,530
Do you remember the first day
you showed me the land?

952
01:29:21,725 --> 01:29:24,335
You said there'd be
a garden there.

953
01:29:28,716 --> 01:29:31,736
You said, "This is
where we'll grow old."

954
01:29:36,039 --> 01:29:37,369
Are we old, Hervé?

955
01:29:38,202 --> 01:29:38,782
[crying]

956
01:29:59,673 --> 01:30:02,003
Hervé:
She died in late April...

957
01:30:05,790 --> 01:30:08,410
A few days before her lilies bloomed.

958
01:30:19,064 --> 01:30:22,474
Hervé: And then, something
extraordinary happened.

959
01:30:26,637 --> 01:30:26,977
Aah!

960
01:30:39,286 --> 01:30:41,158
Hervé: The one-handed Baldabiou...
Hmm.

961
01:30:41,159 --> 01:30:42,948
Pulled off an impossible shot.

962
01:30:42,949 --> 01:30:43,759
Fancy that.

963
01:30:44,447 --> 01:30:47,177
Hervé: So, he gave his mill to Verdal,

964
01:30:47,318 --> 01:30:48,718
packed one suitcase,

965
01:30:48,858 --> 01:30:50,418
and he left for good.

966
01:31:02,963 --> 01:31:06,983
Baldabiou: I knew a man once who
built his own railroad.

967
01:31:07,250 --> 01:31:08,413
And the beautiful thing is,

968
01:31:08,414 --> 01:31:10,634
he built it completely straight,

969
01:31:10,662 --> 01:31:12,292
without a single curve.

970
01:31:14,198 --> 01:31:16,048
He had a reason for that.

971
01:31:17,653 --> 01:31:19,673
I can't recall what it was.

972
01:31:23,228 --> 01:31:25,038
The reasons get forgotten.

973
01:31:27,223 --> 01:31:28,273
[train whistle]

974
01:31:36,627 --> 01:31:38,165
Hervé: Not long after that,
I found something

975
01:31:38,166 --> 01:31:40,616
that sent me
on another journey...

976
01:31:42,993 --> 01:31:45,493
though not quite
as far this time.

977
01:31:50,399 --> 01:31:51,481
Woman:
She's gone, sir.

978
01:31:51,482 --> 01:31:52,522
Gone to Paris.

979
01:31:53,646 --> 01:31:55,725
Hervé: Yes, but do you have
an address for her?

980
01:31:55,726 --> 01:31:57,926
I'm sorry.
I cannot help you.

981
01:32:03,007 --> 01:32:04,457
Thank you very much.

982
01:32:16,573 --> 01:32:18,973
[church bells chiming
in distance]

983
01:32:22,357 --> 01:32:24,977
Madame Blanche:
How did you find me?

984
01:32:38,543 --> 01:32:41,213
I've knocked on
every door in Paris.

985
01:32:53,814 --> 01:32:57,064
It was you who wrote
that letter, wasn't it?

986
01:33:03,676 --> 01:33:04,946
Hervé: Wasn't it?

987
01:33:09,918 --> 01:33:11,878
It was not I who wrote it.

988
01:33:16,409 --> 01:33:17,449
It was Helene.

989
01:33:24,689 --> 01:33:29,469
Madame Blanche: She had already
written it when she came to see me.

990
01:33:30,349 --> 01:33:34,119
She asked me to copy it out
in Japanese, and I did.

991
01:33:42,957 --> 01:33:44,697
She read me that letter.

992
01:33:47,825 --> 01:33:50,265
She read those words
with a voice

993
01:33:50,446 --> 01:33:53,236
That I have
never been able to forget.

994
01:34:04,345 --> 01:34:07,845
Madame Blanche: I know
it's hard to understand...

995
01:34:08,838 --> 01:34:11,398
But I heard her read
that letter...

996
01:34:13,874 --> 01:34:15,624
and more than anything...

997
01:34:17,660 --> 01:34:19,690
she wanted to be that woman.

998
01:34:23,028 --> 01:34:24,418
<I>She was that woman.

999
01:34:36,426 --> 01:34:37,066
Farewell.

1000
01:34:47,828 --> 01:34:48,878
[birds calling]

1001
01:34:55,110 --> 01:34:55,690
Ludovic.

1002
01:34:56,650 --> 01:34:58,340
Ludovic:
Good day, sir.

1003
01:35:00,810 --> 01:35:02,016
What are you doing here
on a Sunday?

1004
01:35:02,017 --> 01:35:03,306
You shouldn't work
on a Sunday.

1005
01:35:03,307 --> 01:35:05,304
I have a few things to finish,

1006
01:35:05,305 --> 01:35:07,115
Some trimming and weeding.

1007
01:35:08,009 --> 01:35:09,979
How was your trip to Paris?

1008
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:12,040
Fine. Thank you.

1009
01:35:20,117 --> 01:35:22,317
Would you like to sit with me?

1010
01:35:22,407 --> 01:35:23,157
Of course.

1011
01:35:43,171 --> 01:35:45,957
I think you like this place
as much as I do.

1012
01:35:45,958 --> 01:35:47,058
Very much, sir.

1013
01:35:50,119 --> 01:35:53,249
In a way, I suppose
it's your garden, too.

1014
01:35:57,942 --> 01:36:00,313
Remember that little tree
I planted with Madame?

1015
01:36:00,314 --> 01:36:02,044
It's grown so tall now.

1016
01:36:06,930 --> 01:36:08,080
I'm sorry, sir.

1017
01:36:10,758 --> 01:36:11,908
Don't be sorry.

1018
01:36:13,629 --> 01:36:14,089
Silly.

1019
01:36:19,746 --> 01:36:22,196
Death is a strange thing,
Ludovic.

1020
01:36:25,779 --> 01:36:26,829
Hervé: Strange.

1021
01:36:43,630 --> 01:36:46,830
Hervé: But why should
I tell you about this?

1022
01:36:47,542 --> 01:36:48,172
Why now?

1023
01:36:50,746 --> 01:36:53,366
Maybe I just need
to tell someone...

1024
01:36:53,534 --> 01:36:54,974
and maybe it's you.

1025
01:36:57,071 --> 01:36:59,691
I guess it all began
when I came back home

1026
01:36:59,692 --> 01:37:03,182
on leave from the army,
when I first saw Helene.

1027
01:37:22,661 --> 01:37:24,981
And now you know the real story.

1028
01:37:28,487 --> 01:37:30,047
Hervé: It's late now.

1029
01:37:30,984 --> 01:37:32,794
Finish your work tomorrow.

1030
01:37:53,245 --> 01:37:54,705
Helene: My beloved...

1031
01:37:56,574 --> 01:37:57,844
do not be afraid.

1032
01:37:59,986 --> 01:38:00,966
Do not speak.

1033
01:38:04,064 --> 01:38:05,274
Stay as you are.

1034
01:38:05,354 --> 01:38:07,024
I'm here at your side.

1035
01:38:08,724 --> 01:38:09,874
Do you feel me?

1036
01:38:10,930 --> 01:38:13,600
When I touch you
for the first time,

1037
01:38:14,093 --> 01:38:17,993
you will feel the warmth,
but you will not know where.

1038
01:38:18,586 --> 01:38:21,026
Perhaps,
it will be on your eyes.

1039
01:38:23,704 --> 01:38:26,094
Who could ever erase
this moment?

1040
01:38:27,574 --> 01:38:30,404
There is no end to it,
don't you see?

1041
01:38:34,273 --> 01:38:37,019
What we were meant to do,
we have done.

1042
01:38:37,020 --> 01:38:40,280
Believe me, my love,
we have done it forever.

1043
01:38:41,430 --> 01:38:45,800
And if it serves your happiness,
do not hesitate for a moment

1044
01:38:46,132 --> 01:38:48,692
to forget this woman,
who now says,

1045
01:38:50,127 --> 01:38:52,107
without a trace of regret...

1046
01:38:55,161 --> 01:38:55,801
Farewell.

1047
