1
00:00:11,179 --> 00:00:13,347
Man: Folks say life is a song.

2
00:00:13,381 --> 00:00:18,186
For some, that means a ditty;
for others, a dirge.

3
00:00:18,219 --> 00:00:24,258
But at the holiday season,
we all sing a carol...

4
00:00:38,139 --> 00:00:40,541
* Tell me a tale
about Christmas *

5
00:00:40,574 --> 00:00:43,344
* That's brimming with fun
and good cheer *

6
00:00:43,377 --> 00:00:46,147
* Tell me a tale
to bring laughter *

7
00:00:46,180 --> 00:00:48,716
* And maybe the hint
of a tear *

8
00:00:48,749 --> 00:00:51,652
* Tell me a tale
 of a miser *

9
00:00:51,685 --> 00:00:54,522
* Who spoils every joy
that he can *

10
00:00:54,555 --> 00:00:57,291
* Can he get older and wiser?

11
00:00:57,325 --> 00:01:00,328
* Will he become a good man?

12
00:01:00,361 --> 00:01:03,231
* Christmas stories

13
00:01:03,264 --> 00:01:06,334
* What warm memories
they bring *

14
00:01:06,367 --> 00:01:09,203
* Christmas carols

15
00:01:09,237 --> 00:01:11,239
* Make me want to sing

16
00:01:11,272 --> 00:01:14,642
* Tra la la
la la la la la *

17
00:01:14,675 --> 00:01:16,644
* Tra la la la la la la

18
00:01:16,677 --> 00:01:22,316
* Tra la la
la la la la la la *

19
00:01:22,350 --> 00:01:24,652
* Sing me a song
full of wonder *

20
00:01:24,685 --> 00:01:27,855
* Like snow from
the heavens above *

21
00:01:27,888 --> 00:01:32,760
* Sing me a song
about Christmas *

22
00:01:32,793 --> 00:01:35,129
* Sing me a song

23
00:01:35,163 --> 00:01:41,235
* Of love

24
00:01:45,206 --> 00:01:47,175
[clock ticking]

25
00:01:47,208 --> 00:01:49,777

26
00:01:54,315 --> 00:01:59,753
[clock chiming]

27
00:02:02,856 --> 00:02:05,293
Ohhh!

28
00:02:05,326 --> 00:02:07,728
Brr!

29
00:02:19,207 --> 00:02:21,375
I'm gonna
get you again!

30
00:02:21,409 --> 00:02:22,843
Oh, no, you won't!

31
00:02:22,876 --> 00:02:25,579
Ha ha ha!

32
00:02:26,447 --> 00:02:28,416
Ah...

33
00:02:48,536 --> 00:02:49,903
[humming]

34
00:02:49,937 --> 00:02:52,673
[clock ticking]

35
00:02:53,574 --> 00:02:54,575
...Sixpence.

36
00:02:54,608 --> 00:02:57,411
Younger man:
* Christmas

37
00:02:57,445 --> 00:02:58,546
Cratchit!

38
00:02:58,579 --> 00:03:01,949
Sorry, Mr. Scrooge.

39
00:03:03,384 --> 00:03:05,719
[snoring]

40
00:03:05,753 --> 00:03:06,754
Debit!

41
00:03:06,787 --> 00:03:08,356
Uh...

42
00:03:13,561 --> 00:03:18,366
[growling and sniffing]

43
00:03:18,932 --> 00:03:20,568
[snarling]

44
00:03:20,601 --> 00:03:22,570
Uh! Ohhh...

45
00:03:23,571 --> 00:03:24,938
Ahh! Ahh!

46
00:03:24,972 --> 00:03:28,842
[ruff ruff
ruff ruff ruff]

47
00:03:36,750 --> 00:03:38,986
Excuse me, guv. Aah!

48
00:03:39,019 --> 00:03:40,354
[ruff ruff]

49
00:03:40,388 --> 00:03:42,523
Beat it, brat!

50
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,392
Grr!

51
00:03:44,425 --> 00:03:46,560
[gasps]

52
00:03:55,969 --> 00:03:59,039
Cratchit,
go fetch that coal!

53
00:03:59,072 --> 00:04:02,242
Yes, Mr. Scrooge.

54
00:04:05,012 --> 00:04:06,614
Excuse me, sir.

55
00:04:06,647 --> 00:04:10,651
A merry Christmas,
Uncle Ebenezer!

56
00:04:12,686 --> 00:04:16,256
Bah! Humbug!

57
00:04:17,458 --> 00:04:18,492
[grr]

58
00:04:18,526 --> 00:04:19,760
[ruff ruff]

59
00:04:19,793 --> 00:04:20,994
Christmas a humbug?

60
00:04:21,028 --> 00:04:23,297
Well, you don't
mean that.

61
00:04:23,331 --> 00:04:24,332
I do.

62
00:04:24,365 --> 00:04:28,636
Merry Christmas?
What right have you
to be merry?

63
00:04:28,669 --> 00:04:29,903
You're poor enough.

64
00:04:29,937 --> 00:04:31,872
What right have you
to be grumpy?

65
00:04:31,905 --> 00:04:33,073
You're rich enough.

66
00:04:33,106 --> 00:04:37,945
Yes, rich enough
to realize Christmas
is a time for fools...

67
00:04:37,978 --> 00:04:42,416
Finding themselves
a year older and not
an hour richer.

68
00:04:42,450 --> 00:04:43,951
If I had my way,

69
00:04:43,984 --> 00:04:45,152
every numskull
who goes about

70
00:04:45,185 --> 00:04:50,057
spouting "merry Christmas"
should be stuffed like a turkey,

71
00:04:50,090 --> 00:04:55,763
buried with a stake of holly
through his heart!

72
00:04:56,597 --> 00:04:57,965
Uncle!

73
00:04:57,998 --> 00:04:59,032
Nephew!

74
00:04:59,066 --> 00:05:01,802
Keep Christmas
in your own way

75
00:05:01,835 --> 00:05:03,537
and let me
keep it in mine.

76
00:05:03,571 --> 00:05:07,575
Keep it?
But you don't keep it.

77
00:05:07,608 --> 00:05:08,576
No. I keep busy,

78
00:05:08,609 --> 00:05:12,380
especially
at this wasteful
time of year.

79
00:05:12,413 --> 00:05:13,581
Wasteful?

80
00:05:13,614 --> 00:05:16,584
Well, I've always
thought of Christmas
as a rewarding time.

81
00:05:16,617 --> 00:05:19,953
Even putting aside
its sacred name and origin,

82
00:05:19,987 --> 00:05:23,424
Christmas is still
a joyous, wonderful season,

83
00:05:23,457 --> 00:05:26,026
the only time
in the whole year

84
00:05:26,059 --> 00:05:30,664
when folks seem to open
their hearts and treat
strangers as friends,

85
00:05:30,698 --> 00:05:34,968
and therefore, Uncle,
though it's never put
silver in my pocket,

86
00:05:35,002 --> 00:05:39,673
I say god bless Christmas!

87
00:05:39,707 --> 00:05:41,975
[squeaking]

88
00:05:43,076 --> 00:05:45,579
Ahhh!

89
00:05:47,147 --> 00:05:49,517
Grr!

90
00:05:49,550 --> 00:05:52,119
Bah! Humbug!

91
00:05:53,821 --> 00:05:56,657
[ruff ruff]

92
00:05:58,726 --> 00:06:01,128
[whining]

93
00:06:05,933 --> 00:06:10,037
Give us a smile, Uncle.
Tomorrow is Christmas.

94
00:06:10,070 --> 00:06:11,939
Good afternoon.

95
00:06:11,972 --> 00:06:14,642
Well, have dinner
with my wife and me.

96
00:06:14,675 --> 00:06:17,010
Good afternoon.

97
00:06:17,044 --> 00:06:18,078
Very well.

98
00:06:18,111 --> 00:06:19,747
If you want to be
miserable, fine,

99
00:06:19,780 --> 00:06:23,917
but I'll hang on
to my holiday spirit
to the last.

100
00:06:24,985 --> 00:06:26,454
So merry Christmas, Uncle.

101
00:06:26,487 --> 00:06:29,590
Good afternoon!

102
00:06:29,623 --> 00:06:30,824
Ha ha ha!

103
00:06:30,858 --> 00:06:32,926
And a happy new year!

104
00:06:32,960 --> 00:06:34,995
Good afternoon!

105
00:06:38,766 --> 00:06:40,167
Man:
Scrooge & Marley's,
yes?

106
00:06:40,200 --> 00:06:44,572
Have I the pleasure of
addressing Mr. Scrooge
or Mr. Marley?

107
00:06:44,605 --> 00:06:51,445
Mr. Marley
died 7 years ago
this very night.

108
00:06:51,479 --> 00:06:52,780
Oh, dear!

109
00:06:52,813 --> 00:06:54,014
However,
we have no doubt

110
00:06:54,047 --> 00:06:58,852
your generosity
matches that of your
deceased partner's, hmm?

111
00:06:58,886 --> 00:07:01,955
Here you are,
Mr. Scrooge.

112
00:07:03,123 --> 00:07:05,726
That's only 5 lumps.

113
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,194
Where's the sixth?

114
00:07:07,227 --> 00:07:09,062
The snow, sir.

115
00:07:09,096 --> 00:07:13,901
Back to work!
Coal's not cheap,
you know.

116
00:07:16,236 --> 00:07:18,606
Uh, generosity, yes.

117
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:20,040
Uh, at this
festive season,

118
00:07:20,073 --> 00:07:23,243
it is compassionate
to provide for the poor
and destitute,

119
00:07:23,276 --> 00:07:26,680
who suffer greatly
at this time.

120
00:07:29,683 --> 00:07:33,654
What shall I
put you down for?

121
00:07:35,689 --> 00:07:36,690
Huh?

122
00:07:36,724 --> 00:07:38,091
Nothing!

123
00:07:38,692 --> 00:07:41,061
Ah! You wish
to be anonymous!

124
00:07:41,094 --> 00:07:44,131
I wish to be
left alone!

125
00:07:44,164 --> 00:07:46,033
I don't make merry
at Christmas,

126
00:07:46,066 --> 00:07:50,103
and I can't afford
to make idle people
merry!

127
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:52,806
But surely, sir--

128
00:07:52,840 --> 00:07:53,741
I do my share.

129
00:07:53,774 --> 00:07:57,010
My taxes pay for
the prisons and workhouses,

130
00:07:57,044 --> 00:08:01,048
and those
who are badly off
should go there!

131
00:08:01,081 --> 00:08:02,249
But many
would rather die.

132
00:08:02,282 --> 00:08:07,821
Then they should do it
and decrease
the surplus population.

133
00:08:07,855 --> 00:08:12,960
But, sir,
thousands are in need
of simple comforts.

134
00:08:12,993 --> 00:08:17,297
Huh!
It's not my business,
gentlemen.

135
00:08:17,330 --> 00:08:19,066
Good afternoon.

136
00:08:19,099 --> 00:08:21,769
Uh, but,
Mr. Scrooge--

137
00:08:21,802 --> 00:08:23,537
Scrooge: Debit!

138
00:08:23,571 --> 00:08:25,505

[knock on door]

145
00:08:55,703 --> 00:08:57,705
Hello?

146
00:08:58,806 --> 00:09:01,041
Huh! Bleh!
Beat it, beggar!

147
00:09:01,074 --> 00:09:02,042
Cratchit: No!

148
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:05,178
No, sir.
This is my son Tim.

149
00:09:05,212 --> 00:09:08,148
Oh. You have
a family? Hmm?

150
00:09:08,181 --> 00:09:11,619
He's awfully, uh...

151
00:09:11,652 --> 00:09:13,654
Tiny.

152
00:09:13,687 --> 00:09:15,923
Yes. Yes, he is.

153
00:09:15,956 --> 00:09:17,024
He's our tiny Tim.

154
00:09:17,057 --> 00:09:21,929
Hmm. You'll want
all day off tomorrow,
I suppose.

155
00:09:24,898 --> 00:09:25,999
If it's convenient, sir.

156
00:09:26,033 --> 00:09:28,101
It's not
convenient...

157
00:09:28,135 --> 00:09:29,136
Hee hee hee!

158
00:09:29,169 --> 00:09:30,370
And it's
not fair.

159
00:09:30,403 --> 00:09:35,142
If I docked you for it,
you'd feel cheated,
I imagine.

160
00:09:35,175 --> 00:09:38,746
And yet you don't
think me cheated

161
00:09:38,779 --> 00:09:41,248
when I pay a day's wages
for no work.

162
00:09:41,281 --> 00:09:43,817
It is only
once a year, sir.

163
00:09:43,851 --> 00:09:47,921
A poor excuse for
picking my pocket
every december the 25th!

164
00:09:47,955 --> 00:09:52,092
But I suppose
I've got to give you
the whole day.

165
00:09:52,125 --> 00:09:55,362
Just be here
an hour earlier
next morning.

166
00:09:55,395 --> 00:09:56,797
Yes, sir.

167
00:09:56,830 --> 00:09:58,131
Thank you, sir.

168
00:09:58,165 --> 00:09:59,700
And a very merry...

169
00:09:59,733 --> 00:10:00,768
Um...

170
00:10:00,801 --> 00:10:03,036
Merry evening, sir.

171
00:10:03,070 --> 00:10:04,337
Come, son.

172
00:10:04,371 --> 00:10:07,641
He likes me,
father.

173
00:10:07,675 --> 00:10:08,642
Huh?

174
00:10:08,676 --> 00:10:12,179
Scrooge: Debit!

175
00:10:14,114 --> 00:10:19,319
Get the light,
you liability.

176
00:11:01,394 --> 00:11:02,362
Whee!

177
00:11:02,395 --> 00:11:04,865
Ha ha ha!

178
00:11:11,271 --> 00:11:13,406
Tim: Go, horsy!

179
00:11:13,440 --> 00:11:15,743
Ha ha ha!

180
00:11:18,111 --> 00:11:21,148
[debit panting
and snorting]

181
00:11:22,349 --> 00:11:23,717
Scrooge: Debit!

182
00:11:23,751 --> 00:11:25,018
Huh?

183
00:11:25,052 --> 00:11:27,687
[grr]

184
00:11:34,862 --> 00:11:40,100
That old villain's
cold as ice, isn't he?

185
00:11:45,105 --> 00:11:46,774
[children oohing and ahing]

186
00:11:46,807 --> 00:11:49,076
Look at the size
of that turkey.

187
00:11:49,109 --> 00:11:51,078
Doesn't it
look good?

188
00:11:51,111 --> 00:11:53,013
Debit!

189
00:11:56,984 --> 00:12:00,053
[laughter and piano music
from inside]

190
00:12:10,898 --> 00:12:12,966
What'll it be,
ducky?

191
00:12:13,000 --> 00:12:15,002
Hash for me.
Scraps for my dog.

192
00:12:15,035 --> 00:12:17,504
And be quick
about it.

193
00:12:22,876 --> 00:12:24,845
Every day
the same thing--

194
00:12:24,878 --> 00:12:26,146
cheapest meal
on the menu!

195
00:12:26,179 --> 00:12:30,984
When he could afford
a feast every night,
the old skinflint.

196
00:12:31,018 --> 00:12:36,056
Oh, well, can't let him
ruin our holiday,
now, can we?

197
00:12:36,089 --> 00:12:38,025
Ha ha ha!

198
00:12:39,893 --> 00:12:41,829
* It's Christmastime
at last *

199
00:12:41,862 --> 00:12:43,030
* Revellers, prepare

200
00:12:43,063 --> 00:12:46,466
* Can't you feel a blast of
fresh excitement in the air? *

201
00:12:46,499 --> 00:12:48,135
* The wreath
is out of hock *

202
00:12:48,168 --> 00:12:49,436
* Holly's in the hall

203
00:12:49,469 --> 00:12:52,539
* But take some stock before you
pin that stocking to the wall *

204
00:12:52,572 --> 00:12:56,076
* Random acts of kindness,
random acts of kindness *

205
00:12:56,109 --> 00:12:59,279
* Have you spread your share
of merry Christmas cheer? *

206
00:12:59,312 --> 00:13:01,114
* Perform an act
of kindness? *

207
00:13:01,148 --> 00:13:05,485
* Random acts of kindness,
more than once a year *

208
00:13:05,518 --> 00:13:06,486
For example...

209
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:07,988
Offering
a scone.

210
00:13:08,021 --> 00:13:09,189
Springing
for the nog!

211
00:13:09,222 --> 00:13:12,225
* Throwing out the bone to throw
a banquet for the dog *

212
00:13:12,259 --> 00:13:15,462
* Freshening a drink,
sharing what you've earned *

213
00:13:15,495 --> 00:13:19,099
Man: * Giving without thinking
that it's got to be returned *

214
00:13:19,132 --> 00:13:21,001
All:
* Random acts of kindness

215
00:13:21,034 --> 00:13:22,102
* Random acts
of kindness *

216
00:13:22,135 --> 00:13:25,605
Waitress: * Preferably
performed with anonymity *

217
00:13:25,638 --> 00:13:26,974
* It's your
yuletide duty *

218
00:13:27,007 --> 00:13:28,976
* Commit
some senseless beauty *

219
00:13:29,009 --> 00:13:32,112
* Palm some off on me

220
00:13:32,145 --> 00:13:35,482
All: * Love makes
giving so pleasing *

221
00:13:35,515 --> 00:13:38,118
* 'Tis the seasonal way

222
00:13:38,151 --> 00:13:41,588
* Still the biggest trick
is getting it to stick *

223
00:13:41,621 --> 00:13:45,492
* After Christmas day

224
00:13:45,525 --> 00:13:47,995
Oh, bah! Humbug!

225
00:13:48,028 --> 00:13:51,198
* Give a bum a bob,
he'll go buy a pint of ale *

226
00:13:51,231 --> 00:13:52,632
* Then he'll borrow,
beg, and rob you *

227
00:13:52,665 --> 00:13:54,034
* And at best,
end up in jail *

228
00:13:54,067 --> 00:13:57,871
* When he's been released,
who'll come breaking
through your door? *

229
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,041
* That's what good
your beastly brand
of charity is for *

230
00:14:01,074 --> 00:14:03,143
* Random acts of kindness,
random acts-- *

231
00:14:03,176 --> 00:14:05,913
* You'll find no good deed
goes unpunished *

232
00:14:05,946 --> 00:14:07,881
* And no crook
goes straight *

233
00:14:07,915 --> 00:14:08,982
* Random sacrifices

234
00:14:09,016 --> 00:14:14,054
* Falsely playing nice is
man's most hateful trait *

235
00:14:14,087 --> 00:14:17,490
* See the Christmas snow
falling *

236
00:14:17,524 --> 00:14:20,293
* Don't it tug
at your heart? *

237
00:14:20,327 --> 00:14:23,997
* While you're in this phase,
better change your ways *

238
00:14:24,031 --> 00:14:27,134
* Now's the time to start

239
00:14:27,167 --> 00:14:28,902
Bah! Humbug!

240
00:14:28,936 --> 00:14:30,904
All:
* Random acts of kindness

241
00:14:30,938 --> 00:14:32,139
* Random acts
of kindness *

242
00:14:32,172 --> 00:14:35,976
Waitress: * Just in case it's
you who ends up on the ground *

243
00:14:36,009 --> 00:14:38,445
All:
* Kindly ways and fandom,
kindly acts at random *

244
00:14:38,478 --> 00:14:44,584
* Make the world go round

245
00:14:44,617 --> 00:14:49,656
Waitress, here's the only tip
you'll be getting from me:

246
00:14:49,689 --> 00:14:54,061
Find a new chef.
Your hash
isn't fit for a dog.

247
00:14:54,094 --> 00:14:55,262
Ha ha ha!

248
00:14:55,295 --> 00:14:58,265
[everybody laughing]

249
00:15:10,443 --> 00:15:14,014
[baby crying]

250
00:15:16,683 --> 00:15:18,518
Please, sir.

251
00:15:18,551 --> 00:15:21,121
[baby cries]

252
00:15:36,103 --> 00:15:38,538
[gasps]

253
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:42,542
Jacob?

254
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:44,544
Boo!

255
00:15:44,577 --> 00:15:45,712
[gasps]

256
00:15:45,745 --> 00:15:48,415
Argh!

257
00:15:51,318 --> 00:15:53,987
Wretched animal!

258
00:16:13,773 --> 00:16:16,109
[debit whines]

259
00:16:17,210 --> 00:16:19,979
Stupid dog.

260
00:16:26,253 --> 00:16:28,021
[wind blows]

261
00:16:28,055 --> 00:16:30,057
[debit whimpers]

262
00:16:34,494 --> 00:16:39,466
Eeerie male voice:
Ebenezer Scrooge.

263
00:16:39,499 --> 00:16:41,034
Huh?

264
00:16:42,069 --> 00:16:44,003
[gasps]

265
00:16:59,419 --> 00:17:01,421
Humbug!

00:17:19,739 --> 00:17:23,110
[wind blows]

268
00:17:31,318 --> 00:17:33,553
Scrooge.

269
00:17:33,586 --> 00:17:35,555
Huh? Ah!

270
00:17:41,528 --> 00:17:45,532
Scrooge.

271
00:17:45,565 --> 00:17:49,469
Go away!
I won't believe it.

272
00:17:49,502 --> 00:17:51,571
[ruff ruff]

273
00:17:51,604 --> 00:17:55,375
Shut up! It's nothing!

274
00:18:11,824 --> 00:18:16,296
Bah! Old fool! You're
acting like a dunderhead!

275
00:18:16,329 --> 00:18:19,399
No such thing as spirits!

276
00:18:19,432 --> 00:18:21,568
[yelps]

277
00:18:32,179 --> 00:18:35,114
What is it, debit?

278
00:18:38,185 --> 00:18:40,153
[whimpering]

279
00:18:53,366 --> 00:18:58,871
Ebenezer Scrooge!

280
00:18:58,905 --> 00:19:01,574
Sic him!

281
00:19:07,580 --> 00:19:09,182
[yelps]

282
00:19:10,983 --> 00:19:13,853
Look at me,
Ebenezer!

283
00:19:13,886 --> 00:19:18,858
In life I was
your partner...

284
00:19:18,891 --> 00:19:23,196
Jacob Marley.

285
00:19:23,230 --> 00:19:26,833
I heard you had
no heart, Jacob.

286
00:19:26,866 --> 00:19:28,568
Now I see it's true.

287
00:19:28,601 --> 00:19:32,939
So you believe
in me, then.

288
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:34,807
I don't.

289
00:19:34,841 --> 00:19:38,711
You're probably just
some undigested food--

290
00:19:38,745 --> 00:19:41,781
some bad beef
or a blob of mustard.

291
00:19:41,814 --> 00:19:45,652
There's more of gravy
than of grave about you.

292
00:19:45,685 --> 00:19:49,188
[shouting angrily]

293
00:19:53,926 --> 00:19:55,928
Ahh!

294
00:20:00,933 --> 00:20:05,004
Mercy! Why do
you haunt me?

295
00:20:05,037 --> 00:20:08,275
I've come
to warn you...

296
00:20:08,308 --> 00:20:12,445
To spare you my fate.

297
00:20:12,812 --> 00:20:14,981
You mean...All this...

298
00:20:15,014 --> 00:20:16,416
Hardware?

299
00:20:16,449 --> 00:20:20,753
I wear the chain
I forged in life.

300
00:20:20,787 --> 00:20:23,590
I made it
link by link.

301
00:20:23,623 --> 00:20:28,561
This link was when
I evicted those orphans,

302
00:20:28,595 --> 00:20:32,632
and here's when I
cheated old Mrs. Avery.

303
00:20:32,665 --> 00:20:37,970
And your chain
was this long and heavy
7 years ago!

304
00:20:38,004 --> 00:20:43,576
You should see it
now, Ebenezer.

305
00:20:44,377 --> 00:20:46,546
I can't see a chain!

306
00:20:46,579 --> 00:20:48,715
I can!

307
00:20:48,748 --> 00:20:51,284
And it is
a monstrous one!

308
00:20:51,318 --> 00:20:57,424
It is our human duty
to walk among
our neighbors

309
00:20:57,457 --> 00:20:59,692
and do good.

310
00:20:59,726 --> 00:21:03,596
If we fail to do this
while we're alive,

311
00:21:03,630 --> 00:21:09,436
then we're doomed
to do it after death.

312
00:21:09,469 --> 00:21:10,803
Look!

313
00:21:10,837 --> 00:21:13,840
See that poor woman?

314
00:21:13,873 --> 00:21:15,908
It's not
my business.

315
00:21:15,942 --> 00:21:20,647
Mankind is
our business.

316
00:21:22,114 --> 00:21:24,717
[baby whimpering]

317
00:21:24,751 --> 00:21:25,718
Please.

318
00:21:25,752 --> 00:21:28,688
Take this
for the baby.

319
00:21:28,721 --> 00:21:34,961
Marley: By the time
we realize we must
help one another,

320
00:21:34,994 --> 00:21:37,630
it is usually too late.

321
00:21:37,664 --> 00:21:44,537
When we're dead,
we can no longer do
any earthly good.

322
00:21:44,571 --> 00:21:46,573
But I have good news!

323
00:21:46,606 --> 00:21:50,109
Tonight,
on the anniversary
of my death,

324
00:21:50,142 --> 00:21:56,549
I've been given
the opportunity to
warn you, Scrooge.

325
00:21:56,583 --> 00:22:01,688
Perhaps you can
escape my fate.

326
00:22:01,721 --> 00:22:02,789
Really?

327
00:22:02,822 --> 00:22:06,025
You simply visit me,
and then everything's
all right?

328
00:22:06,058 --> 00:22:09,061
Almost. You'll also be
haunted by 3 spirits.

329
00:22:15,134 --> 00:22:16,369
No deal.

330
00:22:16,403 --> 00:22:22,975
Without their visits,
you cannot hope
to break your chains.

331
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:25,878
I don't care, Jacob!
I like chains!

332
00:22:25,912 --> 00:22:27,880
No ghosts,
you hear me?!

333
00:22:27,914 --> 00:22:31,751
Expect the first when
the bell tolls 1:00.

334
00:22:42,929 --> 00:22:45,965
No ghosts!

335
00:22:49,969 --> 00:22:52,872
Bah! Humbug!

336
00:22:53,906 --> 00:22:57,043

Oww!

348
00:23:39,151 --> 00:23:43,890
Are--are you
the first spirit
Jacob talked about?

349
00:23:43,923 --> 00:23:48,861
Spot on, guvnor!
I'm the ghost
of Christmas past.

350
00:23:48,895 --> 00:23:50,463
Long past?

351
00:23:50,497 --> 00:23:55,668
No. Your past.
Follow me.

352
00:23:56,168 --> 00:23:59,171
It's for
your own good.

353
00:23:59,806 --> 00:24:01,508
A night
of unbroken sleep

354
00:24:01,541 --> 00:24:05,512
would be better
for my good than this.

355
00:24:06,646 --> 00:24:09,048
Shuffle your stumps,
Scrooge!

356
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,918
[gasps]

357
00:24:14,887 --> 00:24:19,225
I'm not made of
mist and moonlight
like you.

358
00:24:19,258 --> 00:24:22,261
I'll fall! No!

00:24:33,005 --> 00:24:34,841
Stop fussing!

364
00:24:34,874 --> 00:24:38,945
You're no help,
debit! Let go!

365
00:24:40,012 --> 00:24:42,181
Huh-uh! Uh-uh!

366
00:24:54,160 --> 00:24:57,697
I...I was a boy here.

367
00:24:57,730 --> 00:25:02,001
Aye, guvnor.
This here was your
boarding school.

368
00:25:02,034 --> 00:25:03,703
Do you recollect
the way?

369
00:25:03,736 --> 00:25:08,007
Recollect it? I could
walk it blindfold.

370
00:25:38,004 --> 00:25:39,872
[inhales deeply]

371
00:25:39,906 --> 00:25:44,143
Ah, chalk dust
and wood smoke.

372
00:25:44,176 --> 00:25:46,746
[sniffing]

373
00:25:55,054 --> 00:25:57,690
[growling]

374
00:26:01,060 --> 00:26:03,029
[yelps]

375
00:26:03,062 --> 00:26:04,764
[chuckles]

376
00:26:04,797 --> 00:26:07,099
What you see are
but shadows

377
00:26:07,133 --> 00:26:09,969
of the things
that have been.

378
00:26:10,002 --> 00:26:12,304
They can't see
of us.

379
00:26:12,338 --> 00:26:13,973
Oh. Of course.

380
00:26:14,006 --> 00:26:18,010
Why didn't you think
of that, you twit?

381
00:26:20,713 --> 00:26:25,952
Spirit: A small boy,
all alone, neglected
by his friends,

382
00:26:25,985 --> 00:26:29,656
rejected by the father
what left him here.

383
00:26:29,689 --> 00:26:32,391
It...It is...

384
00:26:32,424 --> 00:26:34,026
Me.

385
00:26:34,060 --> 00:26:36,863
Poor forgotten boy.

386
00:26:36,896 --> 00:26:42,969
He--I--was never invited
home for the holidays.

387
00:26:43,002 --> 00:26:47,640
Alone...Stranded.

388
00:26:47,674 --> 00:26:48,975
[sniffling]

389
00:26:49,008 --> 00:26:50,677
I wish...

390
00:26:50,710 --> 00:26:52,411
What's the matter, eh?

391
00:26:52,444 --> 00:26:56,115
There was a boy
at my door last night.

392
00:26:56,148 --> 00:26:59,952
Perhaps I should have
given him something.
That's all.

393
00:26:59,986 --> 00:27:04,991
You did, guv.
A fistful of coal!

394
00:27:10,963 --> 00:27:15,401
Scrooge: It's
Robinson Crusoe! Yes!

395
00:27:15,434 --> 00:27:18,004
I remember this day.

396
00:27:18,037 --> 00:27:20,940
He was my favorite
storybook character.

397
00:27:20,973 --> 00:27:26,145
Blimey! You've been visited
by spirits before.

398
00:27:26,178 --> 00:27:29,816
Don't mock me, shade.

399
00:27:40,026 --> 00:27:44,330
* Everyone's gone
but the cat *

400
00:27:44,363 --> 00:27:48,467
* Once again
I'm all alone *

401
00:27:48,500 --> 00:27:52,939
* But I need
all my shadows *

402
00:27:52,972 --> 00:27:57,977
* To show them
I'm fine on my own *

403
00:28:04,516 --> 00:28:06,685
[reowr]

404
00:28:08,054 --> 00:28:10,923
* I'll slay the beast

405
00:28:10,957 --> 00:28:13,993
* I'll bring the feast

406
00:28:14,026 --> 00:28:19,031
* I'll throw a carnival
with 40 clowns at least *

407
00:28:22,501 --> 00:28:25,437
* I'll ride a whale

408
00:28:25,471 --> 00:28:29,508
* I'll find the grail

409
00:28:29,541 --> 00:28:31,443
* I'll be a matador

410
00:28:31,477 --> 00:28:36,415
* What's more, I'll live
to tell the tale *

411
00:28:36,448 --> 00:28:39,986
* Like arthur
on his throne *

412
00:28:40,019 --> 00:28:43,522
* I won't be alone

413
00:28:43,555 --> 00:28:48,761
* Once I pull the sword
out of the stone *

414
00:28:51,363 --> 00:28:55,167
* Not sad at all

415
00:28:55,201 --> 00:28:58,237
* Up on the wall

416
00:28:58,270 --> 00:29:05,011
* See all my friends
when shadows fall *

417
00:29:05,044 --> 00:29:08,948
* But then as
the firelight dies *

418
00:29:08,981 --> 00:29:13,119
* I can see
with my own eyes *

419
00:29:13,152 --> 00:29:16,823
* No friends at all

420
00:29:16,856 --> 00:29:19,325
* When shadows

421
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:25,764
* Fall

422
00:29:29,969 --> 00:29:33,840
Spirit: Let's see
another Christmas.

423
00:29:35,942 --> 00:29:39,045
Bah! Humbug!

424
00:29:47,053 --> 00:29:48,855
[sighs]

425
00:29:48,888 --> 00:29:53,059
So many lonely
Christmases.

426
00:29:53,092 --> 00:29:56,195
Right,
but not this one.

427
00:29:56,228 --> 00:29:58,898
[giggling]
Ebby!

428
00:29:58,931 --> 00:29:59,899
Fan!

429
00:29:59,932 --> 00:30:01,934
Fan?

430
00:30:04,403 --> 00:30:05,337
My little sister.

431
00:30:05,371 --> 00:30:08,307
I've come to bring
you home, dear brother.

432
00:30:08,340 --> 00:30:09,508
Home?

433
00:30:09,541 --> 00:30:11,010
But father...

434
00:30:11,043 --> 00:30:12,544
Oh, pooh on father.

435
00:30:12,578 --> 00:30:14,513
I'm inviting you.
We're family,

436
00:30:14,546 --> 00:30:17,950
and I told father
I want you at home!

437
00:30:17,984 --> 00:30:19,986
Good old fan!

438
00:30:20,019 --> 00:30:21,287
Lovely fan.

439
00:30:21,320 --> 00:30:25,524
Such a large heart for
such a tiny creature.

440
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:27,059
Spirit:
She died a woman

441
00:30:27,093 --> 00:30:29,561
and had, as I
recall, a child.

442
00:30:29,595 --> 00:30:32,164
Yes. My nephew Fred.

443
00:30:32,198 --> 00:30:35,868
Good-bye,
you wretched old school!

444
00:30:35,902 --> 00:30:36,936
Fan was right.

445
00:30:36,969 --> 00:30:41,607
We had
a happy Christmas
in spite of father.

446
00:30:41,640 --> 00:30:45,444
Oh, I wish she were
alive to invite me
home again.

447
00:30:45,477 --> 00:30:49,248
But she has,
through her son Fred.

448
00:30:49,281 --> 00:30:50,983
Don't you see?

449
00:30:51,017 --> 00:30:53,485
Her goodness
lives in him.

450
00:30:53,519 --> 00:30:57,023
Yes. Oh, I wish...

451
00:30:57,056 --> 00:30:59,158
[growls]

452
00:30:59,191 --> 00:31:00,559
Bah! Never mind!

453
00:31:00,592 --> 00:31:04,596
Let us visit
another kind soul.

454
00:31:15,041 --> 00:31:18,377
Why, it's old
Fezziwig, my boss.

455
00:31:18,410 --> 00:31:22,548
Bust my buttons!
He hasn't changed a bit.

456
00:31:23,015 --> 00:31:26,919
Ho ho there,
Ebenezer. Dick!

457
00:31:26,953 --> 00:31:28,587
No more
work tonight.

458
00:31:28,620 --> 00:31:31,958
No, no, it's
Christmas eve, my boys.

459
00:31:31,991 --> 00:31:36,963
Clear away, and let's
have lots of room here.

460
00:31:39,265 --> 00:31:43,269
I was
an apprentice here,
a good one, too.

461
00:31:43,302 --> 00:31:46,973
Old Fezziwig treated me
like his own son.

462
00:31:47,006 --> 00:31:49,008
[whimpers]

463
00:31:54,146 --> 00:31:56,983
[violin playing]

464
00:31:57,016 --> 00:31:59,918
Ha ha ha!

465
00:32:59,178 --> 00:33:00,779
Good old Fezziwig.

466
00:33:00,812 --> 00:33:03,682
Show me a better boss
than that, eh?

467
00:33:03,715 --> 00:33:07,753
So he spent a bit
of cash on some
song and dance.

468
00:33:07,786 --> 00:33:10,089
Where's the prize
in that, eh?

469
00:33:10,122 --> 00:33:11,290
Bit of coin?

470
00:33:11,323 --> 00:33:14,693
You couldn't buy
that much happiness
with a fortune.

471
00:33:14,726 --> 00:33:18,330
He had the power
to render us
happy or sad,

472
00:33:18,364 --> 00:33:21,600
to make our jobs
a pleasure
or a drudgery.

473
00:33:21,633 --> 00:33:27,339
Then he must have set
quite an example for you.

474
00:33:27,373 --> 00:33:28,807
Now what?

475
00:33:28,840 --> 00:33:30,142
Oh, nothing particular.

476
00:33:30,176 --> 00:33:36,415
I'd like to be able
to say something to
Bob Cratchit just now.

477
00:33:36,448 --> 00:33:37,549
That's all.

478
00:33:37,583 --> 00:33:41,553
Come. My time
grows short.

479
00:33:51,397 --> 00:33:53,465
It's belle.

480
00:33:53,499 --> 00:33:57,203
Good news, my darling!
Guess what I've got.

481
00:33:57,236 --> 00:33:59,605
Give me a hint, Ebenezer.

482
00:33:59,638 --> 00:34:03,475
It's small
and round and gold,

483
00:34:03,509 --> 00:34:05,244
and it holds
the future.

484
00:34:05,277 --> 00:34:06,378
A ring?

485
00:34:06,412 --> 00:34:09,848
No! The profits
from my first
business venture!

486
00:34:09,881 --> 00:34:11,817
Isn't it wonderful,
belle?

487
00:34:11,850 --> 00:34:14,253
Now I'm sure
to be a success.

488
00:34:14,286 --> 00:34:18,056
Stop talking,
you mindless pup!

489
00:34:19,225 --> 00:34:22,394
Belle?

490
00:34:24,630 --> 00:34:29,535
* Now we've reached
this bridge together *

491
00:34:29,568 --> 00:34:35,741
* But I hope
we'll soon be crossed *

492
00:34:35,774 --> 00:34:41,280
* So don't put a price
on paradise *

493
00:34:41,313 --> 00:34:46,318
* Or our paradise is lost

494
00:34:46,352 --> 00:34:50,522
* Any bridge
leads to disaster *

495
00:34:50,556 --> 00:34:54,793
* If its moorings
aren't secure *

496
00:34:54,826 --> 00:35:00,232
* Heaven won't provide
on the bridge's
dark side *

497
00:35:00,266 --> 00:35:05,571
* It's our wealth
which will endure *

498
00:35:05,604 --> 00:35:09,708
* I'll cross
this bridge with you *

499
00:35:09,741 --> 00:35:15,414
* I'll cross
 this bridge with you *

500
00:35:15,447 --> 00:35:19,718
* Show me the man
that I once knew *

501
00:35:19,751 --> 00:35:24,756
* And I'll cross
this bridge with you *

502
00:35:24,790 --> 00:35:29,395
* No one lives
on hopes and wishes *

503
00:35:29,428 --> 00:35:34,166
* Love alone
grows dry and cold *

504
00:35:34,200 --> 00:35:39,671
* But the sun
will shine on these
bright dreams of mine *

505
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:44,776
* As upon
this coin of gold *

506
00:35:44,810 --> 00:35:48,714
* Can I cross
this bridge with you? *

507
00:35:48,747 --> 00:35:50,182
* I'm who I am

508
00:35:50,216 --> 00:35:52,851
* Your words leave me
split in two *

509
00:35:52,884 --> 00:35:54,653
* What else can I do?

510
00:35:54,686 --> 00:35:58,757
* Has love begun
or is it through? *

511
00:35:58,790 --> 00:36:04,796
* Should I cross
this bridge with you? *

512
00:36:04,830 --> 00:36:07,966
* Life's so rocky
and unanswered *

513
00:36:07,999 --> 00:36:09,901
* And coarse to judge

514
00:36:09,935 --> 00:36:12,304
* Speak of love
so love can start *

515
00:36:12,338 --> 00:36:14,840
* Why not be safe
and smug? *

516
00:36:14,873 --> 00:36:16,808
* Where's your passion?
Where's your heart? *

517
00:36:16,842 --> 00:36:20,846
* Now it's time to say good-bye
to frivolous dreams we know *

518
00:36:28,520 --> 00:36:33,425
* Can't we cross
this bridge together? *

519
00:36:33,459 --> 00:36:38,864
* I'll cross
this bridge *

520
00:36:38,897 --> 00:36:41,900
* Alone

521
00:36:49,040 --> 00:36:51,510
Go after her,
you fool.

522
00:36:51,543 --> 00:36:53,211
[throws coin]

523
00:36:55,547 --> 00:36:56,848
Stop.

524
00:36:56,882 --> 00:36:58,917
Don't show me
any more.

525
00:36:58,950 --> 00:37:00,051
I told you.

526
00:37:00,085 --> 00:37:03,522
These are the shadows
of the things
that have passed.

527
00:37:03,555 --> 00:37:06,658
Don't go blaming me
for your  choices.

528
00:37:06,692 --> 00:37:09,895
Why are you torturing me
like this, spirit?

529
00:37:09,928 --> 00:37:13,299
Leave me alone, please.

530
00:37:13,332 --> 00:37:15,033
Take me back home.

531
00:37:15,066 --> 00:37:18,437
Haunt me no more.

532
00:37:18,470 --> 00:37:19,738
[sniffling]

533
00:37:19,771 --> 00:37:21,807
Spirit?

534
00:37:23,975 --> 00:37:27,646
Just a bad dream,
was it?

535
00:37:28,914 --> 00:37:34,753
Crying in your sleep,
thick-headed old ninny!

536
00:37:36,522 --> 00:37:39,825
I'm not gonna
take it anymore.

537
00:37:39,858 --> 00:37:41,860
You hear me, spirits?

538
00:37:41,893 --> 00:37:44,463
No more!

539
00:38:01,380 --> 00:38:05,651
[ding ding]

540
00:38:11,490 --> 00:38:13,859
[snoring]

541
00:38:39,485 --> 00:38:42,020
Stupid dog.

542
00:38:54,032 --> 00:38:56,735
[ruff ruff ruff ruff]

543
00:38:59,137 --> 00:39:00,839
What in blazes...

544
00:39:00,872 --> 00:39:04,476
Woman: Come out,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

545
00:39:06,778 --> 00:39:08,814
[whimpering]

546
00:39:11,783 --> 00:39:14,853
Go away. Leave me be.

547
00:39:15,053 --> 00:39:16,021
Come out.

548
00:39:16,054 --> 00:39:20,091
Come out
and know me better.

549
00:39:25,096 --> 00:39:27,065
Observe me, Scrooge.

550
00:39:27,098 --> 00:39:30,836
I am the ghost
of Christmas present.

551
00:39:30,869 --> 00:39:33,705
No! Go away!

552
00:39:33,739 --> 00:39:36,542
[ruff ruff ruff]

553
00:39:40,779 --> 00:39:41,747
Huh?

554
00:39:41,780 --> 00:39:43,882
[sniffing]

555
00:39:44,716 --> 00:39:47,753
[spirit laughing]

556
00:39:47,786 --> 00:39:49,788
Ha ha ha!

557
00:39:49,821 --> 00:39:53,525
I bet you've never had
a guest like me before.

558
00:39:53,559 --> 00:39:58,564
I'm sure I haven't,
madame.

559
00:40:01,900 --> 00:40:03,935
You bet your brass bed.

560
00:40:03,969 --> 00:40:08,774
Nor have you entertained
any of my earlier
family members.

561
00:40:08,807 --> 00:40:10,842
I'm afraid not.

562
00:40:10,876 --> 00:40:14,813
Do you have many
sisters, spirit?

563
00:40:14,846 --> 00:40:16,047
Nearly 1,900.

564
00:40:16,081 --> 00:40:18,850
Come. Touch my robe.

565
00:40:18,884 --> 00:40:21,887
Um...After that
last spirit,

566
00:40:21,920 --> 00:40:23,088
I'd rather not.

567
00:40:23,121 --> 00:40:28,760
Oh. Oh, no. This is not
a multiple choice,
Mr. Grumpy face.

568
00:40:28,794 --> 00:40:29,761
Come!

569
00:40:29,795 --> 00:40:31,630
But my dog
gets lonely.

570
00:40:31,663 --> 00:40:35,100
He needs me to stay
with him.

571
00:40:36,502 --> 00:40:37,736
See?

572
00:40:37,769 --> 00:40:39,137
Uh-uh. Uh-uh.

573
00:40:39,170 --> 00:40:42,774
Oh, he seems
contented enough to me.

574
00:40:42,808 --> 00:40:45,076
Come along.

575
00:40:45,276 --> 00:40:48,213
I've got to get a lock
for that window.

576
00:40:48,246 --> 00:40:53,785
Spirit: Happy Christmas!
Happy me! Happy everyone!

577
00:40:53,819 --> 00:40:55,887
Ha ha ha!

578
00:40:55,921 --> 00:40:57,823
Happy humbug.

579
00:40:57,856 --> 00:40:59,257
What?
Backsliding already?

580
00:40:59,290 --> 00:41:06,164
Well...It's just that...
Why should I be accused
of being selfish when...

581
00:41:06,197 --> 00:41:07,232
Yes?

582
00:41:07,265 --> 00:41:11,069
When Christmas
is a selfish holiday?

583
00:41:11,102 --> 00:41:12,070
What?!

584
00:41:12,103 --> 00:41:15,841
Help!

585
00:41:19,144 --> 00:41:20,011
[chuckles]

586
00:41:20,045 --> 00:41:23,749
So tell me, Scrooge,
was that selfish?

587
00:41:23,782 --> 00:41:24,750
Yes.

588
00:41:24,783 --> 00:41:28,720
You only saved me
so you can annoy me
further.

589
00:41:28,754 --> 00:41:31,857
Ha ha ha! What a tough
old walnut you are.

590
00:41:31,890 --> 00:41:36,828
All right, then.
Let's see if I can
convince you otherwise.

591
00:41:47,873 --> 00:41:48,774
[gasps]

592
00:41:48,807 --> 00:41:52,310
Girl:
I'll never forget it.
I'm so happy.

593
00:41:52,343 --> 00:41:54,846
What a wonderful
Christmas day.

594
00:41:54,880 --> 00:41:56,114
Boy: This is the best
Christmas ever.

595
00:41:56,147 --> 00:42:00,819
Woman: Martha, my dear,
what's keeping your father
and brother?

596
00:42:06,024 --> 00:42:07,659
Here they are now.

597
00:42:07,693 --> 00:42:10,295
Spirit,
who are these people?

598
00:42:10,328 --> 00:42:13,665
What do they have
to do with me?

599
00:42:13,699 --> 00:42:15,934
Just hold your horses.

600
00:42:18,203 --> 00:42:23,341
Good evening, Mrs. Cratchit
and all you little cratchits.

601
00:42:23,374 --> 00:42:24,342
Hello, papa.

602
00:42:24,375 --> 00:42:25,343
Hello,
father.

603
00:42:25,376 --> 00:42:26,144
The Cratchits?

604
00:42:26,177 --> 00:42:30,115
I had no idea bob
lived so...Humbly.

605
00:42:30,148 --> 00:42:35,186
Well, what did you
think, with the wage
you pay him?

606
00:42:36,187 --> 00:42:38,323
Mrs. Cratchit:
How was he in church?

607
00:42:38,356 --> 00:42:40,826
Bob: As good as gold.

608
00:42:40,859 --> 00:42:41,727
No, better.

609
00:42:41,760 --> 00:42:44,930
What? There's something
better than gold?

610
00:42:44,963 --> 00:42:47,833
[family talking excitedly]

611
00:42:47,866 --> 00:42:49,768
Bob: Oh, I'm so hungry.

612
00:42:49,801 --> 00:42:51,870
[children laughing]

613
00:42:51,903 --> 00:42:54,906
So do you want
to talk or eat?

614
00:42:54,940 --> 00:42:56,842
All: Eat!

615
00:42:59,878 --> 00:43:00,946
[laughter]

616
00:43:00,979 --> 00:43:03,915
Bob:
I give you the delighter
of our stomachs--

617
00:43:03,949 --> 00:43:05,751
Mrs. Cratchit.

618
00:43:05,784 --> 00:43:06,918
All: Hear! Hear!

619
00:43:06,952 --> 00:43:08,720
Girl:
That was delicious.

620
00:43:08,754 --> 00:43:10,121
So lovely.

621
00:43:10,155 --> 00:43:13,892
And I give you
the founder
of our feast--

622
00:43:13,925 --> 00:43:14,860
Mr. Scrooge.

623
00:43:14,893 --> 00:43:17,929
Mrs. Cratchit:
Founder of the feast,
indeed.

624
00:43:17,963 --> 00:43:20,098
I wish I had him here.

625
00:43:20,131 --> 00:43:24,102
I'd give him a piece of
my mind to feast upon.

626
00:43:27,138 --> 00:43:29,775
Please, dear. It's
Christmastime at last.

627
00:43:29,808 --> 00:43:30,976
Grievances or not,

628
00:43:31,009 --> 00:43:34,880
it's been Mr. Scrooge
who's kept the chicken
in our pot.

629
00:43:34,913 --> 00:43:36,682
* Yes,
it's Christmas day *

630
00:43:36,715 --> 00:43:38,784
* But Scrooge
has done us ill *

631
00:43:38,817 --> 00:43:41,219
* We must find a way somehow
to exercise goodwill *

632
00:43:41,252 --> 00:43:42,387
How?

633
00:43:42,420 --> 00:43:45,090
* Random acts of kindness
look on him with kindness *

634
00:43:45,123 --> 00:43:47,893
* Can't you see a Scrooge 
Who's simply starved for love? *

635
00:43:47,926 --> 00:43:49,895
* Your kindness
is poetic *

636
00:43:49,928 --> 00:43:51,897
* Kind and sympathetic

637
00:43:51,930 --> 00:43:54,866
* We got plenty of

638
00:43:54,900 --> 00:43:57,435
* Mr. Scrooge
is a poor man *

639
00:43:57,468 --> 00:44:00,872
* We've a good way
to live *

640
00:44:00,906 --> 00:44:04,409
* Greedy folks believe
it's better to receive *

641
00:44:04,442 --> 00:44:09,848
All: * We'd just rather give

642
00:44:09,881 --> 00:44:12,751
* Random acts of kindness
he could use some kindness *

643
00:44:12,784 --> 00:44:15,821
* I've got you to love,
and all he's got
is his wealth *

644
00:44:15,854 --> 00:44:19,090
* Your goodness takes
the cake, but still
for goodness sake *

645
00:44:19,124 --> 00:44:24,730
* We'll drink
this miser's health *

646
00:44:24,763 --> 00:44:26,064
To Scrooge!

647
00:44:26,097 --> 00:44:27,065
Ha ha ha!

648
00:44:27,098 --> 00:44:29,701
I provide them
with an income,

649
00:44:29,735 --> 00:44:32,303
and this is how
they treat me.

650
00:44:32,337 --> 00:44:35,707
Mrs. Cratchit:
Oh, you're too good
for Scrooge, bob,

651
00:44:35,741 --> 00:44:37,743
but I'll drink his health
for your sake.

652
00:44:37,776 --> 00:44:39,811
A merry Christmas
and a happy new year.

653
00:44:39,845 --> 00:44:43,915
Though with all his money,
he's merry enough, I'll bet.

654
00:44:43,949 --> 00:44:45,416
Ha ha ha!

655
00:44:45,450 --> 00:44:49,855
Very good.
Now clear away.

656
00:44:49,888 --> 00:44:53,358
Let me, Tim.
You go warm up.

657
00:45:13,078 --> 00:45:15,380
Look familiar?

658
00:45:18,316 --> 00:45:22,888
Scrooge: Chalk dust
and wood smoke.

659
00:45:25,323 --> 00:45:27,392
Bob: He told me
coming home

660
00:45:27,425 --> 00:45:29,527
that he hoped
the people saw him
in the church

661
00:45:29,560 --> 00:45:30,561
because he was sick

662
00:45:30,595 --> 00:45:32,798
and it might
be nice for them
to be thankful

663
00:45:32,831 --> 00:45:35,767
for their health
and good fortune.

664
00:45:35,801 --> 00:45:37,035
I am.

665
00:45:37,068 --> 00:45:39,170
You am what?

666
00:45:39,204 --> 00:45:40,872
Oh, nothing.

667
00:45:40,906 --> 00:45:42,507
Nothing.

668
00:45:50,916 --> 00:45:52,050
Robinson Crusoe.

669
00:45:52,083 --> 00:45:56,788
See here?
This is just before
the pirates attack.

670
00:45:56,822 --> 00:45:58,323
Oh, dear.
Forget I said that.

671
00:45:58,356 --> 00:46:01,059
I don't want
to ruin it for you.

672
00:46:01,092 --> 00:46:03,094
Oh, but
it's so exciting!

673
00:46:03,128 --> 00:46:06,965
Yes. Read on. Read.

674
00:46:07,398 --> 00:46:11,803
A remarkable boy,
but so frail.

675
00:46:11,837 --> 00:46:16,875
Spirit, tell me if
tiny Tim will live.

676
00:46:17,108 --> 00:46:21,012
I see an empty seat
in the chimney corner

677
00:46:21,046 --> 00:46:22,580
and a crutch
without an owner.

678
00:46:22,613 --> 00:46:25,984
If these shadows remain
unaltered by the future,

679
00:46:26,017 --> 00:46:28,086
the child will die.

680
00:46:28,119 --> 00:46:30,588
No! Oh, no!

681
00:46:30,621 --> 00:46:32,590
Spirit,
say he'll be spared.

682
00:46:32,623 --> 00:46:33,791
Well,
if he's going to die,

683
00:46:33,825 --> 00:46:39,831
he should do it
and decrease the surplus
population, right?

684
00:46:39,865 --> 00:46:41,833
I...I didn't mean--

685
00:46:41,867 --> 00:46:45,603
Next time, find out
who the surplus is.

686
00:46:45,636 --> 00:46:50,175
Remember, Scrooge,
no one is worthless
or unfit to live.

687
00:46:50,208 --> 00:46:54,980
A merry Christmas
to us all, my dears.

688
00:46:55,013 --> 00:46:57,849
That looks nice.

689
00:47:00,919 --> 00:47:02,888
All: God bless us!

690
00:47:03,654 --> 00:47:08,259
Yes. God bless us,
every one.

691
00:47:08,293 --> 00:47:09,460
All: Hear! Hear!

692
00:47:09,494 --> 00:47:12,197
Bob: I'm so thankful
to be in the bosom

693
00:47:12,230 --> 00:47:14,900
of my wonderful family
at Christmastime.

694
00:47:14,933 --> 00:47:18,636
I wish I had a family
to be with.

695
00:47:18,669 --> 00:47:22,440
Ah, but you do,
you silly man.

696
00:47:23,008 --> 00:47:24,275
What place is this?

697
00:47:24,309 --> 00:47:27,612
The house of your
only living relative.

698
00:47:27,645 --> 00:47:29,114
All: Ha ha ha!

699
00:47:29,147 --> 00:47:30,916
Nephew Fred?

700
00:47:30,949 --> 00:47:32,383
And then
the old fellow said,

701
00:47:32,417 --> 00:47:35,553
"What's Christmas but a time
for finding yourself

702
00:47:35,586 --> 00:47:38,990
a year older
and not an hour richer?"

703
00:47:39,024 --> 00:47:41,159
Ha ha ha!

704
00:47:41,192 --> 00:47:43,995
He may mock,
but it's true.

705
00:47:44,029 --> 00:47:46,531
Oh, Scrooge!
Just listen to you!

706
00:47:46,564 --> 00:47:49,935
Oh! You're just
so funny now,
aren't you?

707
00:47:49,968 --> 00:47:52,270
Ha ha ha!
I love you.

708
00:47:52,303 --> 00:47:55,673
Did your Uncle Scrooge
really say that?

709
00:47:55,706 --> 00:47:59,110
Yes, and that Christmas
was a humbug.

710
00:47:59,144 --> 00:48:02,547
Ha ha ha! He's 
 the humbug, Fred.

711
00:48:02,580 --> 00:48:04,615
[laughter]

712
00:48:04,649 --> 00:48:06,584
I want to go now.

713
00:48:06,617 --> 00:48:08,419
Stay put.

714
00:48:08,453 --> 00:48:09,820
You'll like this.

715
00:48:09,854 --> 00:48:14,926
He's a comical old fellow,
but I have nothing bad
to say about him.

716
00:48:14,960 --> 00:48:17,929
What? Not even
his stinginess?

717
00:48:17,963 --> 00:48:20,165
No. His wealth
does him no good,

718
00:48:20,198 --> 00:48:21,799
so I am sorry
for him, really.

719
00:48:21,832 --> 00:48:26,104
And so I'll invite him to
celebrate Christmas every year
for my sweet mother's sake.

720
00:48:26,137 --> 00:48:31,076
I know it's hard to believe,
but she loved him dearly.

721
00:48:31,109 --> 00:48:32,543
I never realized how...

722
00:48:32,577 --> 00:48:33,578
Yes?

723
00:48:33,611 --> 00:48:35,613
How much
he looks like fan.

724
00:48:35,646 --> 00:48:37,648
And with
such a big heart.

725
00:48:37,682 --> 00:48:41,686
Now, in honor
of my mother, I want
to teach you all a song

726
00:48:41,719 --> 00:48:44,622
that she and her brother
Ebenezer used to perform...

727
00:48:44,655 --> 00:48:47,959
When their father
wasn't around.

728
00:48:47,993 --> 00:48:50,528
Ha ha ha!

729
00:48:50,561 --> 00:48:53,664
And you must all join in.

730
00:48:53,698 --> 00:48:54,565
[piano playing]

731
00:48:54,599 --> 00:48:57,135
Yes! I remember this!
 Santa's sooty suit!

732
00:48:57,168 --> 00:49:01,139
* 'twas last Christmas eve
I had a cause *

733
00:49:01,172 --> 00:49:04,009
* To hide
beneath the stairs *

734
00:49:04,042 --> 00:49:06,644
* I stayed awake
for Santa Claus *

735
00:49:06,677 --> 00:49:10,315
* And caught him unawares

736
00:49:10,348 --> 00:49:12,984
* He was coming
through the fireplace *

737
00:49:13,018 --> 00:49:17,255
* From the chimney's
smoky chute *

738
00:49:17,522 --> 00:49:19,657
* And I

739
00:49:19,690 --> 00:49:22,593
* Never quite saw such a sight
 as Santa's sooty suit *

740
00:49:22,627 --> 00:49:26,397
All: * Oh, he never
quite saw such a sight
as Santa's sooty suit *

741
00:49:26,431 --> 00:49:27,598
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
dub-dub-dub-dub *

742
00:49:27,632 --> 00:49:29,500
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
 dub-dub *

743
00:49:29,534 --> 00:49:31,502
* 'twas the red,
red velvet jacket *

744
00:49:31,536 --> 00:49:33,038
* You could tell
was once a beaut *

745
00:49:33,071 --> 00:49:36,041
* All the torn and tousled
trousers streaked with
slushy stains to boot *

746
00:49:36,074 --> 00:49:39,377
* With the black
and beaten britches of
a big and burly brute *

747
00:49:39,410 --> 00:49:42,113
* I never dreamed
I might see such a fright
as Santa's sooty suit *

748
00:49:42,147 --> 00:49:46,551
All: * Never dreamed
 he might see such a fright
 as Santa's sooty suit *

749
00:49:46,584 --> 00:49:48,586
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
dub-dub-dub-dub *

750
00:49:48,619 --> 00:49:50,621
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
 dub-dub *

751
00:49:50,655 --> 00:49:52,690
Come, then. It's time
for the missis.

752
00:49:52,723 --> 00:49:54,792
* It had blotchy,
brownish buckles *

753
00:49:54,825 --> 00:49:56,494
* And a belt
of liquorice root *

754
00:49:56,527 --> 00:50:00,031
* With scruffy, fluffy ruffles
fallen into disrepute *

755
00:50:00,065 --> 00:50:01,366
* It was smudgy, soiled,
and sullied *

756
00:50:01,399 --> 00:50:02,767
* Yet somehow
sort of cute *

757
00:50:02,800 --> 00:50:05,636
* Wish I had a quid
for each stain that's hid
on Santa's sooty suit *

758
00:50:05,670 --> 00:50:10,175
All: * Wish I had a quid
 for each stain that's hid
 on Santa's sooty suit *

759
00:50:10,208 --> 00:50:11,576
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
dub-dub-dub-dub *

760
00:50:11,609 --> 00:50:15,146
* Scrub-a-dub-a-dub
 dub-dub *

761
00:50:15,180 --> 00:50:17,682
Ha ha ha! Now
Santa talks to him.

762
00:50:17,715 --> 00:50:20,518
* Then old Santa
did address me *

763
00:50:20,551 --> 00:50:23,188
* And his tone
was resolute *

764
00:50:23,221 --> 00:50:26,757
* He said, "son,
don't second-guess me *

765
00:50:26,791 --> 00:50:30,161
* Come and be
my new recruit" *

766
00:50:30,195 --> 00:50:33,531
* His appeal
did so impress me *

767
00:50:33,564 --> 00:50:37,635
* I was near
about to scoot *

768
00:50:37,668 --> 00:50:42,340
* Then I looked up, heaven bless
me, at old Santa's sooty suit *

769
00:50:42,373 --> 00:50:46,411
All: * And I looked up,
heaven bless me, at old
Santa's sooty suit *

770
00:50:46,444 --> 00:50:48,546
Come on,
everybody! Let's
put it all together!

771
00:50:48,579 --> 00:50:51,582
* 'twas a red, red velvet
jacket you could tell
was once a beaut *

772
00:50:51,616 --> 00:50:54,685
* All the torn and tousled
trousers streaked with
slushy stains to boot *

773
00:50:54,719 --> 00:50:57,655
* With the black
and beaten britches of
a big and burly brute *

774
00:50:57,688 --> 00:51:00,625
* Oh, there ne'er were duds
more in need of suds
than Santa's-- *

775
00:51:00,658 --> 00:51:01,859
* It had blotchy,
brownish buckles *

776
00:51:01,892 --> 00:51:03,027
* And a belt
of liquorice root *

777
00:51:03,060 --> 00:51:06,597
* With scruffy, fluffy ruffles
fallen into disrepute *

778
00:51:06,631 --> 00:51:08,133
* It was smudgy,
soiled, and sullied *

779
00:51:08,166 --> 00:51:09,134
* Yet somehow sort of cute

780
00:51:09,167 --> 00:51:10,768
* Never dreamed I might
see such a fright *

781
00:51:10,801 --> 00:51:12,603
* That made that night
when I looked right *

782
00:51:12,637 --> 00:51:14,272
* At Santa's stinky,
grey, and inky *

783
00:51:14,305 --> 00:51:15,706
* Messy, mucky, icky, yucky

784
00:51:15,740 --> 00:51:17,575
* Crunchy, grubby,
needs a scrubby *

785
00:51:17,608 --> 00:51:19,210
* Scrub-a-dub sooty suit!

786
00:51:19,244 --> 00:51:20,211
Hooray!

787
00:51:20,245 --> 00:51:23,248
Ha ha ha!

788
00:51:23,281 --> 00:51:24,782
Ha ha ha!

789
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:26,484
Ha ha ha!

790
00:51:26,517 --> 00:51:28,586
Did you see me,
spirit?

791
00:51:28,619 --> 00:51:32,323
Ha ha ha!

792
00:51:32,357 --> 00:51:35,160
Yes, Scrooge.
Very merry.

793
00:51:35,193 --> 00:51:36,861
However, we must go now.

794
00:51:36,894 --> 00:51:38,863
But I was just
enjoying myself.

795
00:51:38,896 --> 00:51:44,735
Scrooge, my stay upon
this earth is very brief.

796
00:51:44,769 --> 00:51:46,771
It ends this very night.

797
00:51:46,804 --> 00:51:50,608
[chiming]

798
00:51:50,641 --> 00:51:54,679
Are spirits' lives
so short?

799
00:51:54,712 --> 00:51:55,780
Farewell.

800
00:51:55,813 --> 00:52:00,318
Farewell,
Ebenezer Scrooge.

801
00:52:03,354 --> 00:52:05,756
Spirit?

802
00:52:05,790 --> 00:52:08,159
[thunder]

803
00:52:08,193 --> 00:52:09,427
[gasp]

804
00:52:09,460 --> 00:52:11,696
Spirit?

805
00:52:13,698 --> 00:52:15,733
Spirit?

806
00:52:19,904 --> 00:52:23,341
Speak to me, spirit.

807
00:52:32,217 --> 00:52:33,818
[gasp]

808
00:52:34,752 --> 00:52:37,388
Am I correct that you are

809
00:52:37,422 --> 00:52:40,791
the ghost of Christmas
yet to come?

810
00:52:42,360 --> 00:52:44,729
Will you not speak
to me?

811
00:52:44,762 --> 00:52:47,665
Is it you who will
show me shadows

812
00:52:47,698 --> 00:52:51,736
of the things that
have not yet happened?

813
00:52:54,539 --> 00:53:00,578
Ghost of the future,
I fear you most of all.

814
00:53:00,611 --> 00:53:03,614
But if your goal
is to do me good,

815
00:53:03,648 --> 00:53:07,785
then I hope to be
a better person than before.

816
00:53:08,753 --> 00:53:11,356
Lead on.

817
00:53:16,727 --> 00:53:19,797
This is
the business exchange.

818
00:53:19,830 --> 00:53:22,633
I come here often.

819
00:53:22,667 --> 00:53:25,703
But where am I today?

820
00:53:26,671 --> 00:53:29,574
No, I don't know much
about it either way.

821
00:53:29,607 --> 00:53:31,409
I only know he died
last night.

822
00:53:31,442 --> 00:53:34,512
Well, the devil has got
his own at last, eh?

823
00:53:34,545 --> 00:53:36,247
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

824
00:53:36,281 --> 00:53:37,582
What's he done
with his money?

825
00:53:37,615 --> 00:53:41,018
Oh, he hasn't
left it to me.
That's all I know.

826
00:53:41,051 --> 00:53:45,623
Gentlemen, tell me,
which of our colleagues
has died?

827
00:53:45,656 --> 00:53:47,725
It will probably be
a cheap funeral

828
00:53:47,758 --> 00:53:49,660
'cause nobody
will go to it.

829
00:53:49,694 --> 00:53:51,262
Ha ha ha!
Ha ha ha!

830
00:53:51,296 --> 00:53:54,932
Oh, I don't mind
going if a lunch
is provided.

831
00:53:54,965 --> 00:53:57,468
Well, good day.

832
00:53:58,503 --> 00:54:01,672
Spirit, I don't understand
the meaning of this.

833
00:54:01,706 --> 00:54:04,809
Who has died?

834
00:54:31,001 --> 00:54:32,703
Yaaah!

835
00:54:34,505 --> 00:54:38,576
Woman: Oh,
look what I found
under here.

836
00:54:38,609 --> 00:54:40,611
Silver, they are.

837
00:54:40,645 --> 00:54:42,713
Think he'll miss 'em?

838
00:54:42,747 --> 00:54:43,748
Nah.

839
00:54:43,781 --> 00:54:45,983
His tea-stirring days
are over.

840
00:54:46,016 --> 00:54:47,985
Ha ha ha ha!

841
00:54:48,018 --> 00:54:48,986
If he wanted someone

842
00:54:49,019 --> 00:54:52,089
to look after
his belongings
after he was dead,

843
00:54:52,122 --> 00:54:55,693
he should have
made friends when he
was still breathing.

844
00:54:55,726 --> 00:55:01,065
Aye, love,
truer words
was never spoke.

845
00:55:01,666 --> 00:55:05,503
You don't mean
to take 'em with
him lyin' there?

846
00:55:05,536 --> 00:55:06,504
Why not?

847
00:55:06,537 --> 00:55:09,707
It's not like he's
gonna catch cold
without 'em.

848
00:55:09,740 --> 00:55:12,543
Or without his
bed curtains,
either.

849
00:55:12,577 --> 00:55:13,978
[both laughing]

850
00:55:14,011 --> 00:55:15,846
[coughing]

851
00:55:16,714 --> 00:55:18,483
Spirit...

852
00:55:18,516 --> 00:55:20,951
This is
a fearful place.

853
00:55:20,985 --> 00:55:23,388
But I see
the lesson.

854
00:55:23,421 --> 00:55:25,756
The fate of
this unhappy man

855
00:55:25,790 --> 00:55:29,126
might happen
to me someday...

856
00:55:29,159 --> 00:55:31,429
Right?

857
00:55:33,398 --> 00:55:35,633
Oh, this is
too harsh to bear.

858
00:55:35,666 --> 00:55:40,004
Let me see some
tenderness connected
with the death,

859
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:42,440
I beseech you.

860
00:55:50,080 --> 00:55:52,683
[woman sobbing]

861
00:55:52,717 --> 00:55:55,720
Oh, the lamp
is so bright
it hurts my eyes.

862
00:55:55,753 --> 00:55:59,690
I mustn't show
weak eyes to your father
when he comes home.

863
00:55:59,724 --> 00:56:00,991
It must be
near his time.

864
00:56:01,025 --> 00:56:02,226
Past it.

865
00:56:02,259 --> 00:56:05,896
I think he walks
a little slower than
he used to, mother.

866
00:56:05,930 --> 00:56:08,666
Oh, I have known him
to walk with...

867
00:56:08,699 --> 00:56:12,470
With tiny Tim
upon his shoulder
very fast indeed.

868
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:17,007
But he was very light
to carry, and no trouble.

869
00:56:17,041 --> 00:56:18,008
[sighs]

870
00:56:18,042 --> 00:56:18,976
No trouble.

871
00:56:19,009 --> 00:56:19,977
[door opens]

872
00:56:20,010 --> 00:56:21,045
Bob: Sorry I'm late.

873
00:56:21,078 --> 00:56:22,980
You went there
today, robert?

874
00:56:23,013 --> 00:56:23,981
Yes, dear.

875
00:56:24,014 --> 00:56:25,683
I wish you all
could have gone.

876
00:56:25,716 --> 00:56:28,786
You would have enjoyed
seeing how green
a place it is.

877
00:56:28,819 --> 00:56:32,723
I promised him
that I would walk
there on sunday.

878
00:56:32,757 --> 00:56:33,724
[sobbing]

879
00:56:33,758 --> 00:56:35,726
Little boy...

880
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:37,695
My little boy...

881
00:56:37,728 --> 00:56:39,797
[sobbing]

882
00:56:42,533 --> 00:56:44,034
No, spectre, no!

883
00:56:44,068 --> 00:56:47,838
Not--not tiny Tim.

884
00:56:51,742 --> 00:56:53,678
Spirit, tell me...

885
00:56:53,711 --> 00:56:59,016
Can this cruel future
be changed?

886
00:57:07,758 --> 00:57:09,527
Scrooge:
Is this, then,

887
00:57:09,560 --> 00:57:14,965
where that wretched dead man
now lies underground?

888
00:57:27,545 --> 00:57:29,780
Before I look closer,

889
00:57:29,814 --> 00:57:31,081
answer me one question:

890
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:34,952
Are these the shadows
of the things that will be

891
00:57:34,985 --> 00:57:39,223
or only the things
that might be?

892
00:57:39,824 --> 00:57:42,893
All lives lead
to certain ends,

893
00:57:42,927 --> 00:57:44,895
but if our lives change,

894
00:57:44,929 --> 00:57:48,666
then the ends must
also change, right?

895
00:57:48,699 --> 00:57:50,701
They must!

896
00:57:51,736 --> 00:57:54,238
[breathing shakily]

897
00:57:59,544 --> 00:58:00,645
[gasps]

898
00:58:00,678 --> 00:58:01,946
No.

899
00:58:05,783 --> 00:58:06,751
No!

900
00:58:06,784 --> 00:58:07,752
[gasps]

901
00:58:07,785 --> 00:58:11,188
That lonely corpse
was me!

902
00:58:11,221 --> 00:58:12,256
Oh, no.

903
00:58:12,289 --> 00:58:13,691
[sobbing]

904
00:58:13,724 --> 00:58:14,692
No.

905
00:58:14,725 --> 00:58:17,995
Don't let me
die unmourned.

906
00:58:18,028 --> 00:58:20,030
Spirit, listen.

907
00:58:20,064 --> 00:58:23,167
I am not
the man I was.

908
00:58:23,200 --> 00:58:24,669
I've changed.

909
00:58:24,702 --> 00:58:27,705
I will honor Christmas
in my heart

910
00:58:27,738 --> 00:58:30,040
and keep it all the year.

911
00:58:30,074 --> 00:58:32,209
I will learn
from the past,

912
00:58:32,242 --> 00:58:34,679
I will live
 in the present,

913
00:58:34,712 --> 00:58:37,982
and I will hope
 for the future.

914
00:58:38,015 --> 00:58:41,586
I will keep
the 3 spirits in my soul

915
00:58:41,619 --> 00:58:45,623
and remember
their lessons always.

916
00:58:49,694 --> 00:58:51,195
Good spirit,

917
00:58:51,228 --> 00:58:54,031
I'm not that man anymore.

918
00:58:54,064 --> 00:58:58,803
Why show me these shadows
if I am past all hope?

919
00:58:58,836 --> 00:59:05,209
Please tell me that
I can make a brighter
future than this.

920
00:59:14,051 --> 00:59:16,887
All alone.

921
00:59:19,056 --> 00:59:20,925
Stranded.

922
00:59:31,802 --> 00:59:33,203
[gasps]

923
00:59:34,004 --> 00:59:35,906
I'm home?

924
00:59:35,940 --> 00:59:39,610
I'm home!

925
00:59:39,644 --> 00:59:41,879
[snoring]

926
00:59:41,912 --> 00:59:45,750
I'm home!

927
00:59:45,783 --> 00:59:48,619
I've been given
another chance, debit,

928
00:59:48,653 --> 00:59:50,320
and so have you.

929
00:59:50,354 --> 00:59:51,722
Mmm-uhh!

930
00:59:51,756 --> 00:59:53,758
Oh, ha ha ha!

931
00:59:53,791 --> 00:59:57,194
Ha ha ha!

932
00:59:57,227 --> 01:00:00,998
Oh, heaven and
Christmastime be praised.

933
01:00:01,031 --> 01:00:04,735
I say it on my knees,
old Jacob.

934
01:00:04,769 --> 01:00:06,804
On my knees!

935
01:00:06,837 --> 01:00:09,173
Ha ha ha ha ha!

936
01:00:14,979 --> 01:00:16,814
My spoons!

937
01:00:16,847 --> 01:00:19,249
They're still here.

938
01:00:23,087 --> 01:00:26,857
The dark shadows of things
that would have been...

939
01:00:26,891 --> 01:00:28,258
Are gone.

940
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:30,795
I know they are.

941
01:00:31,095 --> 01:00:34,331
* I heard a tale
about Christmas *

942
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:37,802
* Whose truth
caused my spirit to burn *

943
01:00:37,835 --> 01:00:42,673
* My present, my past,
and my future *

944
01:00:42,707 --> 01:00:45,943
* Taught me
I'd so much to learn *

945
01:00:45,976 --> 01:00:49,346
* I've lived a tale
of a miser *

946
01:00:49,379 --> 01:00:53,017
* Who spoiled every joy
that he could *

947
01:00:53,050 --> 01:00:56,821
* Then he got older
and wiser *

948
01:00:56,854 --> 01:00:59,456
* And only yearned
to be good *

949
01:00:59,489 --> 01:01:02,259
* Once my memories

950
01:01:02,292 --> 01:01:05,696
* Brought me
nothing but pain *

951
01:01:05,730 --> 01:01:08,699
* Now it's Christmas

952
01:01:08,733 --> 01:01:10,935
* With new precious memories
to gain *

953
01:01:10,968 --> 01:01:13,437
* I'll sing a song
full of wonder *

954
01:01:13,470 --> 01:01:16,340
* Like snow
from the heavens above *

955
01:01:16,373 --> 01:01:19,777
* I'll share my new song
of Christmas *

956
01:01:19,810 --> 01:01:20,778
Ha ha ha ha!

957
01:01:20,811 --> 01:01:24,815
* I've a new song
of love *

958
01:01:36,526 --> 01:01:38,896
A merry Christmas
to everybody!

959
01:01:38,929 --> 01:01:43,801
Happy new year
to the world!

960
01:01:43,834 --> 01:01:46,904
Hello,
my fine fellow.

961
01:01:46,937 --> 01:01:48,105
Huh?

962
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:49,439
Yes, you, lad!

963
01:01:49,473 --> 01:01:51,075
[whimpering]

964
01:01:51,108 --> 01:01:53,410
Wait. Don't run.

965
01:01:53,443 --> 01:01:54,478
Please.

966
01:01:54,511 --> 01:01:56,881
But what is it, then?

967
01:01:56,914 --> 01:02:00,184
Do you know
the poultry shop
down the street?

968
01:02:00,217 --> 01:02:02,086
Ha! Is snow white?

969
01:02:02,119 --> 01:02:03,954
An intelligent boy.

970
01:02:03,988 --> 01:02:06,090
A remarkable boy.

971
01:02:06,123 --> 01:02:08,525
Do you know
whether they've sold

972
01:02:08,558 --> 01:02:11,195
the prize turkey
that was hanging there?

973
01:02:11,228 --> 01:02:13,530
What? The one
as big as me?

974
01:02:13,563 --> 01:02:16,767
Ha ha ha!
Yes, my lad.
That very one.

975
01:02:16,801 --> 01:02:22,106
Tell 'em to bring it
here, and I'll give you
a silver coin.

976
01:02:22,139 --> 01:02:23,140
Do you mean it?

977
01:02:23,173 --> 01:02:24,341
Aye, lad.

978
01:02:24,374 --> 01:02:29,546
Come back in less
than 5 minutes,
and I'll give you 2.

979
01:02:29,579 --> 01:02:31,849
Ha ha ha ha!

980
01:02:32,482 --> 01:02:37,788
Come, my faithful friend,
we have much to do.

981
01:02:39,556 --> 01:02:41,792
[panting]

982
01:02:48,332 --> 01:02:50,968
Merry Christmas,
gentlemen!

983
01:02:51,001 --> 01:02:53,203
And a happy new year!

984
01:02:53,237 --> 01:02:55,405
[men gasp]

985
01:02:57,441 --> 01:02:59,409
Oh, dear.

986
01:03:01,879 --> 01:03:03,547
[both gasp]

987
01:03:04,849 --> 01:03:05,983
Scrooge: No!

988
01:03:06,016 --> 01:03:08,018
Wait. Come back!

989
01:03:08,052 --> 01:03:10,154
[growling]

990
01:03:14,458 --> 01:03:17,561
We won't pester you
for money ever again!

991
01:03:17,594 --> 01:03:18,562
We promise!

992
01:03:18,595 --> 01:03:20,030
No, no. Please.

993
01:03:20,064 --> 01:03:21,565
I must apologize
to you both

994
01:03:21,598 --> 01:03:24,601
for the terrible way
I treated you yesterday.

995
01:03:24,634 --> 01:03:28,505
You are  Mr. Scrooge,
 aren't you?

996
01:03:28,538 --> 01:03:32,209
Well, not
that old Scrooge,
at any rate.

997
01:03:32,242 --> 01:03:35,345
Please, let me
donate something

998
01:03:35,379 --> 01:03:40,150
to...To make up
for my selfishness.

999
01:03:40,184 --> 01:03:42,552
Well, certainly.

1000
01:03:42,586 --> 01:03:46,590
So you'll come see me
tomorrow at my office?

1001
01:03:46,623 --> 01:03:50,227
Most certainly.
But, Mr. Scrooge,

1002
01:03:50,260 --> 01:03:51,261
why now?

1003
01:03:51,295 --> 01:03:56,066
Because it's too late
to do it when we're dead.

1004
01:03:56,100 --> 01:03:57,534
Ah!
Ah!

1005
01:03:57,567 --> 01:03:59,269
Yes.
Yes, of course.

1006
01:03:59,303 --> 01:04:01,005
Thank you.
Thank you, Mr. Scrooge.

1007
01:04:01,038 --> 01:04:03,607
Thank you, 
 gentlemen.

1008
01:04:03,640 --> 01:04:06,543
Ha ha ha ha!

1009
01:04:06,576 --> 01:04:10,214
You know, debit,
I like this feeling,

1010
01:04:10,247 --> 01:04:15,019
though I'm not used to
all this smiling yet.

1011
01:04:15,052 --> 01:04:18,555
Bob: Well, my dears,
we may truly count
our blessings.

1012
01:04:18,588 --> 01:04:23,493
I have no idea where this
magnificent bird came from,

1013
01:04:23,527 --> 01:04:24,494
but let's eat!

1014
01:04:24,528 --> 01:04:26,130
Yay!
Let's eat!
Let's!

1015
01:04:26,163 --> 01:04:27,631
[knock at door]

1016
01:04:27,664 --> 01:04:29,599
Oh!

1017
01:04:33,938 --> 01:04:35,239
Merry Christmas!

1018
01:04:35,272 --> 01:04:37,674
Uh, merry Christmas
to you.

1019
01:04:37,707 --> 01:04:40,644
Darling, this is
Mr. Scrooge's nephew,

1020
01:04:40,677 --> 01:04:41,645
master Fred.

1021
01:04:41,678 --> 01:04:44,348
And my dear wife.
May we come in?

1022
01:04:44,381 --> 01:04:47,084
Oh, forgive me.
Of course.

1023
01:04:47,117 --> 01:04:48,052
Please join us.

1024
01:04:48,085 --> 01:04:51,355
We received word
to meet Uncle Ebenezer
here.

1025
01:04:51,388 --> 01:04:52,589
Very urgent.

1026
01:04:52,622 --> 01:04:55,592
Mr. Scrooge?
Coming here?

1027
01:04:55,625 --> 01:04:58,095
What have I done now?

1028
01:04:58,128 --> 01:04:58,895
Hee hee hee!

1029
01:04:58,929 --> 01:05:02,599
Won't Bob Cratchit
be surprised?

1030
01:05:03,267 --> 01:05:04,901
How's this?

1031
01:05:05,602 --> 01:05:06,470
[panting]

1032
01:05:06,503 --> 01:05:10,374
No, no.
You must look mean
as well.

1033
01:05:16,546 --> 01:05:19,483
Debit! Nasty!

1034
01:05:20,250 --> 01:05:21,218
Oh!

1035
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:22,552
[growling]

1036
01:05:22,586 --> 01:05:24,621
Good, good.

1037
01:05:31,661 --> 01:05:34,131
Cratchit.

1038
01:05:34,164 --> 01:05:36,600
M--Mr. Scrooge?

1039
01:05:36,633 --> 01:05:40,137
What do you mean
being here
this time of day?

1040
01:05:40,170 --> 01:05:41,371
I--i--i--it's...

1041
01:05:41,405 --> 01:05:43,707
Only once a year, sir.

1042
01:05:43,740 --> 01:05:44,708
Uncle!

1043
01:05:44,741 --> 01:05:46,643
[debit growling]

1044
01:05:46,676 --> 01:05:47,944
Uh!

1045
01:05:47,978 --> 01:05:52,116
I am not going to stand
for this sort of thing
any longer,

1046
01:05:52,149 --> 01:05:55,452
and therefore,
I am about to...

1047
01:05:55,485 --> 01:05:57,621
No, please,
Mr. Scrooge...

1048
01:05:57,654 --> 01:06:01,225
Raise your salary.

1049
01:06:01,258 --> 01:06:02,559
Huh!

1050
01:06:02,592 --> 01:06:03,994
A raise?

1051
01:06:04,028 --> 01:06:05,095
A raise!

1052
01:06:05,129 --> 01:06:08,765
A merry Christmas,
bob.

1053
01:06:08,798 --> 01:06:10,234
[ruff]

1054
01:06:10,267 --> 01:06:11,068
Scrooge: Yes!

1055
01:06:11,101 --> 01:06:14,538
A merrier Christmas,
my good fellow,

1056
01:06:14,571 --> 01:06:18,508
than I have given
you for many a year.

1057
01:06:18,542 --> 01:06:20,410
And starting today,

1058
01:06:20,444 --> 01:06:23,613
I'm paying you
what you deserve.

1059
01:06:23,647 --> 01:06:25,082
[children cheering]

1060
01:06:25,115 --> 01:06:26,583
I, uh...

1061
01:06:26,616 --> 01:06:27,584
I--

1062
01:06:27,617 --> 01:06:30,120
I give you
Mr. Scrooge,

1063
01:06:30,154 --> 01:06:32,556
the founder
of the feast.

1064
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:33,790
All: Hear, hear!

1065
01:06:33,823 --> 01:06:35,659
[all laughing]

1066
01:06:37,227 --> 01:06:39,263
[ruff ruff]

1067
01:06:42,332 --> 01:06:44,634
[playing lively tune]

1068
01:06:50,807 --> 01:06:53,310
[children laughing]

1069
01:06:53,343 --> 01:06:54,378
Scrooge: Yes!

1070
01:06:54,411 --> 01:06:56,146
Just like
at old Fezziwig's.

1071
01:06:56,180 --> 01:07:01,418
And later, Fred
 and I will teach you
 Santa's sooty suit.

1072
01:07:01,451 --> 01:07:03,320
[children cheering]

1073
01:07:03,353 --> 01:07:04,588
We will, indeed.

1074
01:07:04,621 --> 01:07:08,192
Now let's celebrate!

1075
01:07:08,225 --> 01:07:11,195
Oh, a dolly!

1076
01:07:16,766 --> 01:07:18,135
Fred, my boy,

1077
01:07:18,168 --> 01:07:21,571
is there enough
of your mother in you

1078
01:07:21,605 --> 01:07:24,441
to forgive
an old humbug?

1079
01:07:24,474 --> 01:07:28,112
Welcome to the family,
Uncle Scrooge.

1080
01:07:31,481 --> 01:07:33,417
Do you like it, Tim?

1081
01:07:33,450 --> 01:07:36,620
Oh, yes, sir!
Thank you, sir!

1082
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:39,289
We're going to
get you well,
young man.

1083
01:07:39,323 --> 01:07:44,328
And afterward,
you can teach me
to slide on the ice.

1084
01:07:44,361 --> 01:07:45,662
Oh, yes, sir!

1085
01:07:45,695 --> 01:07:47,464
And the doggy, too.

1086
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:48,732
God bless us.

1087
01:07:48,765 --> 01:07:53,203
Both: God bless us,
every one.

1088
01:07:53,237 --> 01:07:54,804
[ruff ruff]

1089
01:07:54,838 --> 01:07:58,542
Narrator: And Scrooge
was as good as his word.

1090
01:07:58,575 --> 01:07:59,643
No, better.

1091
01:07:59,676 --> 01:08:01,678
He was like
a second father to Tim

1092
01:08:01,711 --> 01:08:04,514
and became as good a friend,
as good a master,

1093
01:08:04,548 --> 01:08:08,452
and as good a man
as anyone in the world.

1094
01:08:08,485 --> 01:08:13,423
And he kept Christmas
in his heart forever.
