00:00:28,833 --> 00:00:34,084
<b>WALKING DEAD IN THE WEST</b>

2
00:00:36,582 --> 00:00:39,582
<b>Subrip: Pix</b>

3
00:01:52,512 --> 00:01:56,214
Back then I was a lawman
in the Arizona territory

4
00:01:56,215 --> 00:01:58,384
so sneaking up on bad
men and outlaws was

5
00:01:58,385 --> 00:02:00,952
something I did quite often.

6
00:02:00,953 --> 00:02:01,854
No no.

7
00:02:01,855 --> 00:02:02,789
Nobody move.

8
00:02:02,790 --> 00:02:03,790
It's all right, Marshal.

9
00:02:03,791 --> 00:02:05,192
No no, it's all right.

10
00:02:05,193 --> 00:02:07,692
Let me
see those hands.

11
00:02:07,693 --> 00:02:09,595
Nobody moves.

12
00:02:09,596 --> 00:02:11,598
You move, I'll kill you.

13
00:02:13,300 --> 00:02:15,601
This was a bad bunch.

14
00:02:15,602 --> 00:02:18,305
George River, Ike and Bob Davis.

15
00:02:20,806 --> 00:02:22,541
Outlaws through and through.

16
00:02:22,542 --> 00:02:24,644
Killers and horse thieves,
and I'd been tracking them

17
00:02:24,645 --> 00:02:26,146
a long, long time.

18
00:02:27,280 --> 00:02:30,616
Today was gonna be
their day of reckoning.

19
00:02:34,187 --> 00:02:38,358
Of all the bad things they
did, all the things they stole.

20
00:02:39,459 --> 00:02:41,259
Don't you move!

21
00:02:41,260 --> 00:02:43,596
And all the people they killed,

22
00:02:43,597 --> 00:02:47,600
there would be a price
to pay, there always was.

23
00:02:50,937 --> 00:02:54,406
I can't
move, you shot me.

24
00:02:54,407 --> 00:02:56,275
Get up, convict.

25
00:02:56,276 --> 00:02:57,509
Get up.

26
00:02:57,510 --> 00:02:58,344
Get up.

27
00:03:13,325 --> 00:03:16,430
Lord, I pray
that you have mercy

28
00:03:17,597 --> 00:03:19,365
on these two souls who
are about ready to leave

29
00:03:19,366 --> 00:03:20,767
this green Earth.

30
00:03:26,840 --> 00:03:30,876
Caleb Jennings, you have
been found guilty of rustling,

31
00:03:30,877 --> 00:03:33,213
theft by person, and murder.

32
00:03:34,580 --> 00:03:35,881
We are gathered here
this morning to carry out

33
00:03:35,882 --> 00:03:37,849
your sentence of death.

34
00:03:37,850 --> 00:03:39,884
Do you have any last words?

35
00:03:39,885 --> 00:03:40,721
Nope.

36
00:04:12,752 --> 00:04:13,586
He dead.

37
00:04:15,455 --> 00:04:18,590
Now, I know I've
not been a good man,

38
00:04:18,591 --> 00:04:21,393
but I've not done
some things you say.

39
00:04:21,394 --> 00:04:25,564
I didn't kill them people,
and God knows that this is so.

40
00:04:26,800 --> 00:04:30,869
So, to hang me today,
well that'd be against

41
00:04:30,870 --> 00:04:32,371
God's will, I say.

42
00:04:34,206 --> 00:04:35,141
And, and...

43
00:04:47,920 --> 00:04:49,388
Wait!

44
00:04:49,389 --> 00:04:50,557
No, you can't.

45
00:04:52,925 --> 00:04:56,061
God, please, give
these people a sign

46
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:57,962
that I'm truly innocent.

47
00:04:57,963 --> 00:04:59,598
Please, God, please!

48
00:05:05,605 --> 00:05:07,073
You see, I told you.

49
00:05:08,507 --> 00:05:10,775
That was a sign
from God almighty.

50
00:05:10,776 --> 00:05:12,845
You saw that, don't you?

51
00:05:12,846 --> 00:05:14,280
You all saw that.

52
00:05:14,281 --> 00:05:15,748
Yeah, I see it.

53
00:05:15,749 --> 00:05:17,782
You can't hang me, Sheriff.

54
00:05:17,783 --> 00:05:19,185
They seen it.

55
00:05:29,596 --> 00:05:30,930
What the hell?

56
00:05:39,271 --> 00:05:40,740
What's going on?

57
00:05:43,108 --> 00:05:44,376
I don't know.

58
00:05:50,617 --> 00:05:51,451
No.

59
00:06:02,028 --> 00:06:05,198
Can I at least
have my hat, Marshal?

60
00:06:11,271 --> 00:06:13,206
What the hell was that?

61
00:06:19,245 --> 00:06:22,748
Marshal, you ever seen
anything like that?

62
00:06:25,584 --> 00:06:29,287
I had never
seen anything like that.

63
00:06:29,288 --> 00:06:32,791
It was something
strange, that's for sure.

64
00:06:34,060 --> 00:06:35,562
Get up.

65
00:06:39,132 --> 00:06:40,634
Come on, untie me.

66
00:06:43,403 --> 00:06:45,104
And soon after,
the horses were spooked

67
00:06:45,105 --> 00:06:46,105
and ran off.

68
00:06:47,339 --> 00:06:50,509
Marshal, I can't take no more.

69
00:07:03,023 --> 00:07:05,191
And they were
dead 'cause I had shot

70
00:07:05,192 --> 00:07:07,325
each of the Davis
brothers in the heart.

71
00:07:07,326 --> 00:07:12,164
Square, square clean in the
heart with a.30-30 rifle.

72
00:07:12,165 --> 00:07:15,099
And nobody, and I mean
nobody gets back up

73
00:07:15,100 --> 00:07:19,138
after being shot in the
heart with a.30-30 rifle.

74
00:07:19,139 --> 00:07:22,408
So this was mighty
strange indeed.

75
00:07:26,478 --> 00:07:29,280
What's going on
here, Preacher?

76
00:07:29,281 --> 00:07:31,482
Apparently he's
coming back to life.

77
00:07:31,483 --> 00:07:33,051
That's not possible.

78
00:07:33,052 --> 00:07:36,220
Well, he's as dead as
that one, that's for sure.

79
00:07:36,221 --> 00:07:38,223
Clem, check his pulse.

80
00:07:44,997 --> 00:07:46,465
No pulse, Sheriff.

81
00:07:46,466 --> 00:07:48,268
Well, listen for a heartbeat.

82
00:07:55,675 --> 00:07:59,179
I don't hear nothing, Sheriff.

83
00:08:09,521 --> 00:08:10,522
Sheriff!

84
00:08:11,423 --> 00:08:13,592
No, Sheriff, I'm sorry.

85
00:08:15,862 --> 00:08:16,963
I'm so sorry.

86
00:08:18,064 --> 00:08:20,567
Get those two to defend him.

87
00:08:28,375 --> 00:08:29,874
She's dead too.

88
00:08:29,875 --> 00:08:30,709
No.

89
00:08:52,599 --> 00:08:54,532
What's going on, Sheriff?

90
00:08:54,533 --> 00:08:57,870
I don't know, Rose
Anne, I don't know.

91
00:09:18,158 --> 00:09:19,792
I'll go get my medical gear.

92
00:09:19,793 --> 00:09:21,292
Okay.

93
00:09:21,293 --> 00:09:23,027
Clem, go with him in case
some more of those things

94
00:09:23,028 --> 00:09:24,196
are out there.

95
00:09:24,197 --> 00:09:25,965
All right, Sheriff.

96
00:09:27,299 --> 00:09:29,133
What things?

97
00:09:29,134 --> 00:09:30,668
The dead outlaws.

98
00:09:30,669 --> 00:09:31,503
You should have seen...

99
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:33,138
Go, Clem, go.

100
00:09:33,139 --> 00:09:34,540
Yes, Sheriff.

101
00:09:34,541 --> 00:09:36,910
And don't shoot nobody
that don't need shootin'

102
00:09:36,911 --> 00:09:38,877
Yes, Sheriff.

103
00:09:38,878 --> 00:09:40,812
What are you talking about?

104
00:09:40,813 --> 00:09:43,047
What was all that running?

105
00:09:43,048 --> 00:09:44,516
Was it the hanging?

106
00:09:44,517 --> 00:09:48,253
Yeah, we hung 'em,
but they didn't die.

107
00:09:48,254 --> 00:09:53,258
Well, they did, but then
there was a flash in the sky,

108
00:09:53,259 --> 00:09:57,428
and they both opened their
eyes and started screaming.

109
00:09:57,429 --> 00:10:00,165
It's the damndest
thing I ever did see.

110
00:10:00,166 --> 00:10:03,969
It was like the dead
come back to life.

111
00:10:03,970 --> 00:10:05,737
That's impossible.

112
00:10:05,738 --> 00:10:07,739
Jenny, please go and
get me some water.

113
00:10:07,740 --> 00:10:10,908
We need to clean this
little girl's face.

114
00:10:10,909 --> 00:10:14,913
It's the Miller girl
Becky, poor little thing.

115
00:10:17,817 --> 00:10:21,421
Both her parents are
dead, they were killed

116
00:10:22,388 --> 00:10:24,624
right before our very eyes.

117
00:10:25,792 --> 00:10:28,093
I mean, they were
run over by a horse.

118
00:10:28,094 --> 00:10:29,427
Ben Miller and his wife?

119
00:10:29,428 --> 00:10:30,262
Yes!

120
00:10:31,397 --> 00:10:33,098
Did you say they're dead?

121
00:10:33,099 --> 00:10:37,402
They're dead, they're
lying right outside dead.

122
00:10:37,403 --> 00:10:38,403
My god.

123
00:10:42,642 --> 00:10:43,841
Here, Miss Rose.

124
00:10:43,842 --> 00:10:44,843
Thank you.

125
00:10:48,480 --> 00:10:50,250
What am I thinking.

126
00:10:55,754 --> 00:10:57,321
Jasper?

127
00:10:57,322 --> 00:10:58,556
Get me a drink, will ya?

128
00:10:58,557 --> 00:10:59,859
Sure, Sheriff.

129
00:11:13,605 --> 00:11:15,941
I thought you
said he was dead.

130
00:11:15,942 --> 00:11:17,743
I thought he was dead.

131
00:11:17,744 --> 00:11:19,878
He was dead, deader
than a doornail.

132
00:11:19,879 --> 00:11:20,812
Ben? Ben?

133
00:11:22,749 --> 00:11:24,117
He don't look right.

134
00:11:24,118 --> 00:11:27,518
Hold
right there, Ben.

135
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:28,353
Daddy.

136
00:11:53,111 --> 00:11:55,714
I believe I've got everything.

137
00:11:55,715 --> 00:11:57,584
As soon as we get the
sheriff patched up,

138
00:11:57,585 --> 00:12:01,052
then we're gonna take a proper
look at that neck of yours.

139
00:12:01,053 --> 00:12:01,887
Sure.

140
00:12:05,557 --> 00:12:06,658
She's dead.

141
00:12:14,366 --> 00:12:16,534
What's going on
here, Preacher?

142
00:12:16,535 --> 00:12:20,205
First that thing in the
sky, and those dead men

143
00:12:20,206 --> 00:12:22,139
thrashing about.

144
00:12:22,140 --> 00:12:24,109
Sheriff's got a hole
in his shoulder.

145
00:12:24,110 --> 00:12:27,378
I never shot anybody
before, honest.

146
00:12:27,379 --> 00:12:29,181
You can fix it
can't you, Preacher?

147
00:12:29,182 --> 00:12:30,450
You can fix this.

148
00:12:33,418 --> 00:12:34,987
Mrs. Miller?

149
00:12:34,988 --> 00:12:36,756
Are you all right, Mrs. Miller?

150
00:12:36,757 --> 00:12:38,257
Are you all right?

151
00:12:39,192 --> 00:12:41,293
Mrs. Miller? Mrs. Miller?

152
00:12:45,697 --> 00:12:47,199
Shoot her, Clem.

153
00:12:47,200 --> 00:12:50,002
Sheriff said not to shoot
anyone that don't need shooting.

154
00:12:50,003 --> 00:12:51,403
Mrs. Miller?

155
00:12:55,107 --> 00:12:56,441
Not any more.

156
00:12:56,442 --> 00:12:57,709
Shoot her.

157
00:12:57,710 --> 00:13:00,179
Sheriff said not
to shoot anyone.

158
00:13:08,587 --> 00:13:09,421
My god.

159
00:13:10,889 --> 00:13:11,823
She's coming.

160
00:13:11,824 --> 00:13:13,158
Who?

161
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:21,767
Mrs. Miller, she...

162
00:13:21,768 --> 00:13:24,103
Shoot her, Clem!

163
00:13:30,143 --> 00:13:33,012
What the hell was
going on here, Preacher.

164
00:13:33,013 --> 00:13:35,814
It appears the dead
are coming back to life.

165
00:13:35,815 --> 00:13:36,848
It's not possible.

166
00:13:36,849 --> 00:13:37,849
Nevertheless, it's...

167
00:13:37,850 --> 00:13:39,484
It can't be happening.

168
00:13:39,485 --> 00:13:41,152
This ain't happening.

169
00:13:41,153 --> 00:13:42,586
Pull yourself together, Clem.

170
00:13:42,587 --> 00:13:44,790
No, no I'm not seeing this.

171
00:14:19,258 --> 00:14:20,524
Shoot her, Clem.

172
00:14:20,525 --> 00:14:23,494
I can't shoot a little girl!

173
00:14:23,495 --> 00:14:24,896
She's not a little
girl any more.

174
00:14:24,897 --> 00:14:25,732
Shoot her.

175
00:14:25,733 --> 00:14:28,067
Somebody do something!

176
00:14:35,508 --> 00:14:38,075
You shot her, Sheriff!

177
00:14:38,076 --> 00:14:40,480
You shot little Becky Miller.

178
00:14:51,857 --> 00:14:53,525
You take this gun.

179
00:14:55,327 --> 00:14:56,161
Take it.

180
00:14:57,296 --> 00:15:00,031
And you go and
stand by that door

181
00:15:00,032 --> 00:15:03,402
and you shoot any more
of those things that try

182
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:05,337
and come in here again.

183
00:15:06,672 --> 00:15:07,939
Go.

184
00:15:07,940 --> 00:15:10,042
Do what she says, Clem.

185
00:15:12,177 --> 00:15:13,946
All right, Sheriff.

186
00:15:59,091 --> 00:16:00,926
Without
horses, we walked on,

187
00:16:00,927 --> 00:16:03,762
me and the outlaw,
George Rivers.

188
00:16:03,763 --> 00:16:05,997
Around the summer months, the
desert would have killed us

189
00:16:05,998 --> 00:16:10,835
for sure, but I was lucky
that this all began in April.

190
00:16:10,836 --> 00:16:13,673
April, the year
of our lord, 1876.

191
00:16:18,543 --> 00:16:20,612
They was dead, Marshal.

192
00:16:22,347 --> 00:16:24,516
You and I both know you don't
survive a shot to the chest

193
00:16:24,517 --> 00:16:26,685
with that rifle of yours.

194
00:16:26,686 --> 00:16:30,857
You got 'em square in the
heart too, you're a good shot.

195
00:16:31,957 --> 00:16:33,959
And the horses,
that's why the horses

196
00:16:33,960 --> 00:16:36,961
started running away, man.

197
00:16:36,962 --> 00:16:39,431
This all spooked 'em.

198
00:16:39,432 --> 00:16:42,268
Something's not
right about today.

199
00:16:44,903 --> 00:16:46,072
They was dead.

200
00:16:48,908 --> 00:16:50,808
Yeah, they was dead.

201
00:16:50,809 --> 00:16:51,643
Get up.

202
00:16:55,514 --> 00:16:57,014
You're not listening.

203
00:16:57,015 --> 00:16:59,050
The outlaw,
George Rivers, was right.

204
00:16:59,051 --> 00:17:01,853
There was something
not right about today.

205
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:03,287
And Ike and Bob
Davis had been dead

206
00:17:03,288 --> 00:17:06,992
before I killed them
both for the second time.

207
00:17:48,467 --> 00:17:51,469
When I saw the old Apache
surrounded by those things,

208
00:17:51,470 --> 00:17:55,105
I pretty much figured out
this was happening everywhere.

209
00:17:55,106 --> 00:17:57,709
The dead were walking.

210
00:17:57,710 --> 00:18:00,645
Do not tell me you're
gonna waste lead on there.

211
00:18:19,030 --> 00:18:20,364
That day
was also the first time

212
00:18:20,365 --> 00:18:23,802
I ever used my rifle
to protect an Apache.

213
00:18:23,803 --> 00:18:25,670
Usually I was using
it to stop one of them

214
00:18:25,671 --> 00:18:27,806
from trying to kill me.

215
00:18:27,807 --> 00:18:29,207
They were a tough bunch.

216
00:18:29,208 --> 00:18:30,475
That's incredible.

217
00:18:30,476 --> 00:18:31,410
If you ever
saw them, it was because

218
00:18:31,411 --> 00:18:32,878
they wanted you to see them.

219
00:18:32,879 --> 00:18:36,748
And they were usually
none too friendly either.

220
00:18:36,749 --> 00:18:39,485
I can't say I blame them
what with what was happening

221
00:18:39,486 --> 00:18:41,853
with territory, but
they were always to be

222
00:18:41,854 --> 00:18:43,822
approached with caution.

223
00:18:43,823 --> 00:18:47,994
Why does the
white man, an enemy,

224
00:18:48,928 --> 00:18:50,496
help an old Apache?

225
00:18:51,529 --> 00:18:54,065
Because he needed help.

226
00:18:54,066 --> 00:18:55,468
Thank you.

227
00:18:56,368 --> 00:18:58,036
You're welcome.

228
00:18:58,037 --> 00:19:01,473
Do the dead also
walk among your people?

229
00:19:02,474 --> 00:19:04,142
Yeah, it seems to.

230
00:19:05,877 --> 00:19:08,212
Why is this Apache
speaking like a human?

231
00:19:08,213 --> 00:19:10,147
Shut up, convict.

232
00:19:10,148 --> 00:19:10,982
Come on.

233
00:19:35,207 --> 00:19:36,042
Jenny.

234
00:19:45,550 --> 00:19:47,384
Hold it right there!

235
00:19:47,385 --> 00:19:50,654
Or I'll shoot, you better stop!

236
00:19:50,655 --> 00:19:51,490
You better...

237
00:19:53,893 --> 00:19:55,660
What are you shooting at?

238
00:19:55,661 --> 00:19:57,162
You said to shoot...

239
00:19:57,163 --> 00:19:59,864
I said don't shoot nobody
that don't need shootin'.

240
00:19:59,865 --> 00:20:02,200
And Wyatt don't need shootin'.

241
00:20:02,201 --> 00:20:03,035
Wyatt?

242
00:20:03,036 --> 00:20:04,602
Jenny!

243
00:20:04,603 --> 00:20:06,004
Why is he shooting?

244
00:20:06,005 --> 00:20:08,841
He's not gonna shoot
any more, are you, Clem?

245
00:20:08,842 --> 00:20:10,475
No.

246
00:20:10,476 --> 00:20:12,143
You sure he ain't
gonna shoot no more?

247
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:13,746
I'm sure.

248
00:20:19,184 --> 00:20:20,019
Are you okay?

249
00:20:31,396 --> 00:20:33,698
Preacher, what is going on?

250
00:20:33,699 --> 00:20:35,735
There's dead people
walking in the street

251
00:20:35,736 --> 00:20:39,170
and the men on the ropes
they're just, they're screaming!

252
00:20:58,523 --> 00:21:00,424
I should check on my folks.

253
00:21:00,425 --> 00:21:02,493
All the horses have run off.

254
00:21:02,494 --> 00:21:03,328
I know.

255
00:21:05,597 --> 00:21:07,699
I saw the horses
run out of town.

256
00:21:07,700 --> 00:21:11,437
That's when my horse bucked
me off and went running after.

257
00:21:11,438 --> 00:21:14,239
Don't worry, your
folks will be fine.

258
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:15,173
Mr. Gull?

259
00:21:48,941 --> 00:21:51,175
Sheriff, Mr. Gull's dead.

260
00:21:51,176 --> 00:21:54,711
One of those dead
men was eating him.

261
00:21:54,712 --> 00:21:57,383
Eating him?

262
00:21:59,551 --> 00:22:00,885
Son of a bitch.

263
00:22:04,824 --> 00:22:08,026
We should close up the door
and board up these windows.

264
00:22:08,027 --> 00:22:10,696
No telling how many
more could be out there.

265
00:22:10,697 --> 00:22:13,297
Yeah, I got a hammer
in nails in the back.

266
00:22:13,298 --> 00:22:15,533
There's some wood
in the back there too.

267
00:22:15,534 --> 00:22:16,366
I can help.

268
00:22:16,367 --> 00:22:17,202
Yeah?

269
00:22:28,913 --> 00:22:30,448
Come on, Clem.

270
00:22:30,449 --> 00:22:31,649
Where are we going, Sheriff?

271
00:22:31,650 --> 00:22:33,718
To see if the telegraph works.

272
00:22:33,719 --> 00:22:35,487
All right, Sheriff.

273
00:22:43,494 --> 00:22:45,095
What are we gonna do with him?

274
00:22:45,096 --> 00:22:48,466
We gotta move
him out of the way.

275
00:22:48,467 --> 00:22:49,700
Okay.

276
00:22:49,701 --> 00:22:50,536
Come on.

277
00:22:55,974 --> 00:22:57,208
You all ain't dead...

278
00:22:57,209 --> 00:22:58,276
As they
day got longer,

279
00:22:58,277 --> 00:23:00,312
we met a buffalo soldier.

280
00:23:02,847 --> 00:23:05,048
I didn't know it at the time,

281
00:23:05,049 --> 00:23:08,886
but Sergeant Bale and I would
become very good friends.

282
00:23:08,887 --> 00:23:10,387
He was a good man.

283
00:23:10,388 --> 00:23:13,258
Sergeant Bale, US Army.

284
00:23:13,259 --> 00:23:15,325
Marshal Frank Wilcox.

285
00:23:15,326 --> 00:23:16,261
Pleasure.

286
00:23:16,262 --> 00:23:17,195
Likewise.

287
00:23:17,196 --> 00:23:18,829
Now, this is just great.

288
00:23:18,830 --> 00:23:20,864
Shut up, convict.

289
00:23:20,865 --> 00:23:25,037
Now travelling with a lawman,
an Indian, and now a Yankee.

290
00:23:30,075 --> 00:23:32,343
Meet the outlaw George Rivers,

291
00:23:32,344 --> 00:23:35,613
back shooter and killer
of women and children.

292
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:38,082
I don't know his name,
but I'm guessing he's

293
00:23:38,083 --> 00:23:40,018
full blood Chiricahua.

294
00:23:40,019 --> 00:23:42,386
And how is it that you're
travelling with an Apache?

295
00:23:42,387 --> 00:23:44,989
Well, he got in a
little trouble back there

296
00:23:44,990 --> 00:23:47,325
with some of those things,
and, I couldn't exactly

297
00:23:47,326 --> 00:23:50,394
stand by and let them
get him now, could I.

298
00:23:50,395 --> 00:23:51,595
Guess not.

299
00:23:51,596 --> 00:23:53,397
You shouldn't
have done that.

300
00:23:53,398 --> 00:23:57,235
Knocked my damn tooth
out, you son of a bitch.

301
00:23:59,171 --> 00:24:01,340
You've seen 'em
too, haven't you.

302
00:24:01,341 --> 00:24:02,673
Yes, sir.

303
00:24:02,674 --> 00:24:03,841
I surely have.

304
00:24:04,943 --> 00:24:07,377
Dead folks coming to life?

305
00:24:07,378 --> 00:24:10,081
Spooked my horse
so bad he threw me.

306
00:24:10,082 --> 00:24:11,783
Probably done run
himself to death by now

307
00:24:11,784 --> 00:24:14,085
the way he took off.

308
00:24:14,086 --> 00:24:15,752
This don't make no sense though.

309
00:24:15,753 --> 00:24:16,954
So where you all headed?

310
00:24:16,955 --> 00:24:18,957
I was headed to Tucson
With some prisoners,

311
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:22,794
but right now I'm just
heading up this road.

312
00:24:22,795 --> 00:24:25,363
Town of Crumpit is
just up ahead a spell.

313
00:24:25,364 --> 00:24:27,597
Good a place as
any on this day.

314
00:24:27,598 --> 00:24:30,168
They won't be too
happy to see him.

315
00:24:30,169 --> 00:24:32,905
He's not
bothering anybody.

316
00:24:35,740 --> 00:24:37,342
What outfit you from?

317
00:24:37,343 --> 00:24:38,177
10th.

318
00:25:01,866 --> 00:25:03,468
Line must be down somewhere.

319
00:25:03,469 --> 00:25:04,470
You think?

320
00:25:05,371 --> 00:25:06,772
Yeah, probably.

321
00:25:08,073 --> 00:25:09,341
You don't think the
same thing's happening

322
00:25:09,342 --> 00:25:10,508
down in Tucson Do you?

323
00:25:10,509 --> 00:25:13,644
I don't know, Clem,
I sure hope not.

324
00:25:31,029 --> 00:25:32,463
Telegraph is out.

325
00:25:35,733 --> 00:25:37,701
You don't look so good.

326
00:25:37,702 --> 00:25:38,537
Sit down.

327
00:25:40,405 --> 00:25:41,973
The thing bit me.

328
00:25:47,846 --> 00:25:49,013
It sure did.

329
00:26:03,327 --> 00:26:06,663
Be still,
I gotta clean it.

330
00:26:06,664 --> 00:26:09,166
It's already infected.

331
00:26:09,167 --> 00:26:11,602
That's awfully fast.

332
00:26:11,603 --> 00:26:13,904
I don't feel too good.

333
00:26:13,905 --> 00:26:15,573
I got the shakes.

334
00:26:15,574 --> 00:26:17,009
You just relax.

335
00:26:18,109 --> 00:26:19,911
Any idea what's going
on here, Preacher?

336
00:26:19,912 --> 00:26:21,511
I dunno.

337
00:26:21,512 --> 00:26:24,481
I'd like to examine the
outlaws on the rope.

338
00:26:24,482 --> 00:26:26,616
They're the only ones
I can safely approach.

339
00:26:26,617 --> 00:26:29,252
I wouldn't exactly say that.

340
00:26:29,253 --> 00:26:30,755
Examine them for what?

341
00:26:30,756 --> 00:26:32,824
Bodily functions and such.

342
00:26:32,825 --> 00:26:34,992
Just what makes them tick.

343
00:26:37,162 --> 00:26:39,596
I'd also like to
visit the cemetery.

344
00:26:39,597 --> 00:26:41,098
The cemetery?

345
00:26:41,099 --> 00:26:43,101
I wanna know if all the
dead are coming back to life

346
00:26:43,102 --> 00:26:44,602
or just the ones we've seen.

347
00:26:44,603 --> 00:26:45,837
That's crazy.

348
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:49,806
Rose Anne, watch over Clem.

349
00:26:49,807 --> 00:26:51,008
I will.

350
00:26:51,009 --> 00:26:54,912
Wyatt, Jasper,
you're coming with us.

351
00:26:54,913 --> 00:26:56,347
You be careful.

352
00:26:57,548 --> 00:26:58,383
I will.

353
00:27:37,556 --> 00:27:40,893
No heartbeat, just
like the other one.

354
00:27:41,894 --> 00:27:43,228
So, he's dead.

355
00:27:44,395 --> 00:27:47,864
Absolutely, dead
as a door nail.

356
00:27:47,865 --> 00:27:49,666
Then how...

357
00:27:49,667 --> 00:27:53,104
Well, that's the
question now isn't it.

358
00:27:55,007 --> 00:27:56,108
Let's go dig.

359
00:29:24,528 --> 00:29:27,365
You gotta shoot
'em in the head.

360
00:29:37,241 --> 00:29:40,544
I hadn't been through
Crumpit in a long long time.

361
00:29:40,545 --> 00:29:42,479
It had been one of
those little boom towns

362
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,749
built around the silver strike.

363
00:29:44,750 --> 00:29:46,883
Of course, the silver
had long since played out

364
00:29:46,884 --> 00:29:49,353
and most of the
people had moved on.

365
00:29:49,354 --> 00:29:53,525
So whoever had stayed was
living a hard life indeed.

366
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,490
I'm gonna die, Sheriff.

367
00:30:27,392 --> 00:30:31,261
That means, don't let
me turn into one of 'em.

368
00:30:31,262 --> 00:30:32,096
Zombies?

369
00:30:33,030 --> 00:30:35,499
You're not gonna die, Clem.

370
00:30:35,500 --> 00:30:39,671
I am, Sheriff, I can feel
it, I can feel it in my bones.

371
00:30:42,507 --> 00:30:44,241
You rest now, Clem.

372
00:30:45,943 --> 00:30:47,678
All right, sheriff.

373
00:30:47,679 --> 00:30:50,480
So you've heard of zombies.

374
00:30:50,481 --> 00:30:51,415
Yes, sir.

375
00:30:52,616 --> 00:30:55,618
Just stories spun by
my grandmother is all.

376
00:30:55,619 --> 00:30:59,222
About the walking
dead, about zombies.

377
00:30:59,223 --> 00:31:00,024
Zombies?

378
00:31:01,460 --> 00:31:05,395
Zombie's an other name for
the voodoo that got done.

379
00:31:05,396 --> 00:31:08,231
Only heard of this
happening in here.

380
00:31:08,232 --> 00:31:12,937
There are reports of ghouls,
zombies walking out today.

381
00:31:12,938 --> 00:31:14,773
That's from stories of
the voodoo practitioners

382
00:31:14,774 --> 00:31:16,841
from the Congo in Africa.

383
00:31:19,144 --> 00:31:22,779
I hardly ever paid
it any mind but now.

384
00:31:22,780 --> 00:31:24,315
Who knows.

385
00:31:24,316 --> 00:31:27,050
I don't know what the hell
you guys are talking about.

386
00:31:27,051 --> 00:31:27,885
Yes.

387
00:31:29,054 --> 00:31:30,522
Just don't bother waiting.

388
00:31:36,228 --> 00:31:38,429
Well, whatever
these things were,

389
00:31:38,430 --> 00:31:41,600
they were now surrounding
the Double Peach saloon

390
00:31:41,601 --> 00:31:43,201
and everyone in it.

391
00:31:44,635 --> 00:31:46,804
I don't know, Preacher,
this idea of not shooting 'em,

392
00:31:46,805 --> 00:31:49,206
it doesn't sound like
such a good idea.

393
00:31:49,207 --> 00:31:51,409
It must have veen
the flash in the sky.

394
00:31:51,410 --> 00:31:52,610
What?

395
00:31:52,611 --> 00:31:54,245
I'm talking
about the catalyst.

396
00:31:54,246 --> 00:31:56,881
The thing that caused
all this to happen.

397
00:31:56,882 --> 00:31:58,149
What does it matter now?

398
00:31:58,150 --> 00:31:59,918
We gotta deal with these things.

399
00:31:59,919 --> 00:32:02,720
And knowing all about them
will help us deal with them.

400
00:32:02,721 --> 00:32:05,155
I'm not sure that
we have enough bullets

401
00:32:05,156 --> 00:32:07,658
to deal with all of 'em.

402
00:32:07,659 --> 00:32:09,628
We should have gone
to Obarts and got us

403
00:32:09,629 --> 00:32:11,729
some ammunition and supplies.

404
00:32:11,730 --> 00:32:13,329
We still can.

405
00:32:13,330 --> 00:32:15,399
I'm not real excited
about being stuck in here

406
00:32:15,400 --> 00:32:16,866
with no ammunition.

407
00:32:16,867 --> 00:32:18,235
I'm with you there.

408
00:32:18,236 --> 00:32:20,205
Hold on, we just
can't open those doors

409
00:32:20,206 --> 00:32:22,440
and go out there,
they'll tear us apart.

410
00:32:22,441 --> 00:32:25,508
Not if we have rifle
fire from the front door.

411
00:32:25,509 --> 00:32:26,810
I can take care of that.

412
00:32:26,811 --> 00:32:29,380
Now hold on, I'm in no
shape to go out there.

413
00:32:29,381 --> 00:32:32,383
Nobody's asking you to go.

414
00:32:32,384 --> 00:32:33,450
I'll go.

415
00:32:33,451 --> 00:32:36,353
Gotta offer you that choice.

416
00:32:36,354 --> 00:32:37,189
I'll go.

417
00:32:38,355 --> 00:32:41,625
I know Obarts like
the back of my hand.

418
00:32:48,666 --> 00:32:50,468
Sergeant Bale
was one of those rare men

419
00:32:50,469 --> 00:32:53,671
who could shoot real good
at the worst of times.

420
00:32:53,672 --> 00:32:56,473
Times when men were
shooting back at you,

421
00:32:56,474 --> 00:32:58,374
or what was the case that day,

422
00:32:58,375 --> 00:32:59,211
when the dead were walking.

423
00:32:59,212 --> 00:33:00,010
Obarts.

424
00:33:01,946 --> 00:33:03,948
Can you shoot something?

425
00:33:03,949 --> 00:33:04,850
Yes, sir.

426
00:33:14,792 --> 00:33:16,826
Young Wyatt
probably could shoot,

427
00:33:16,827 --> 00:33:20,564
but not under pressure,
not when it mattered.

428
00:33:20,565 --> 00:33:23,267
It could have been his
youth and inexperience,

429
00:33:23,268 --> 00:33:25,036
only time would tell.

430
00:33:26,203 --> 00:33:28,672
The same could not be
said for the Apache.

431
00:33:28,673 --> 00:33:31,508
He was a real warrior
like Sergeant Bale.

432
00:33:31,509 --> 00:33:35,680
I was happy to see he hit
what he had to when he had to.

433
00:33:38,549 --> 00:33:39,384
Obarts.

434
00:34:06,144 --> 00:34:06,978
Bullets.

435
00:34:09,514 --> 00:34:10,948
Yeah.

436
00:34:10,949 --> 00:34:12,182
Right, come on.

437
00:34:17,822 --> 00:34:20,457
What I remember
of Jasper the bartender

438
00:34:20,458 --> 00:34:22,225
was that he had heart.

439
00:34:22,226 --> 00:34:23,928
He was a tough son of a gun

440
00:34:23,929 --> 00:34:26,664
and there was no
quitting in him.

441
00:34:33,605 --> 00:34:35,807
He could shoot a
pistol real good too.

442
00:34:35,808 --> 00:34:38,107
Back in those days,
that was the difference

443
00:34:38,108 --> 00:34:41,045
between your livin'
and your dyin'.

444
00:34:53,724 --> 00:34:56,560
Christ, Jenny,
it'll be okay.

445
00:34:57,795 --> 00:34:59,697
How can you say that?

446
00:35:01,699 --> 00:35:03,201
Well, we'll see.

447
00:35:06,103 --> 00:35:09,305
The world has changed,
it's falling apart.

448
00:35:09,306 --> 00:35:12,643
Nothing is gonna be
the same ever again.

449
00:35:13,844 --> 00:35:15,312
We're together, okay?

450
00:35:15,313 --> 00:35:16,379
We're together.

451
00:35:16,380 --> 00:35:18,215
That's okay, isn't it?

452
00:35:20,452 --> 00:35:21,953
Of course that's okay.

453
00:35:21,954 --> 00:35:26,055
But dead people are
walking the streets.

454
00:35:26,056 --> 00:35:30,227
I'm not gonna let anyone
or anything hurt you, Jenny.

455
00:35:31,329 --> 00:35:32,163
Not ever.

456
00:35:35,367 --> 00:35:39,303
I would die before that
would happen to you.

457
00:35:39,304 --> 00:35:41,639
That's what I'm afraid of.

458
00:35:46,344 --> 00:35:48,412
Don't let me
become one of them.

459
00:35:48,413 --> 00:35:50,913
I don't wanna be one
of them, all right?

460
00:35:50,914 --> 00:35:52,015
You rest now, Clem.

461
00:35:52,016 --> 00:35:54,517
Promise me, Sheriff!

462
00:35:54,518 --> 00:35:55,519
I promise.

463
00:35:57,322 --> 00:36:00,025
It's time to
shoot me, Sheriff.

464
00:36:07,766 --> 00:36:08,599
Clem.

465
00:36:16,340 --> 00:36:20,576
I'd let go of his hand
if I were you, Sheriff.

466
00:36:20,577 --> 00:36:22,246
Shut up, Preacher.

467
00:36:40,864 --> 00:36:41,965
Holy crap!

468
00:36:54,378 --> 00:36:55,913
I'm sorry, Clem.

469
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:57,381
We didn't much
like shooting Deputy Clem

470
00:36:57,382 --> 00:36:59,783
after he opened his eyes,
but I doubt very much

471
00:36:59,784 --> 00:37:01,884
that the sheriff could
have or would have

472
00:37:01,885 --> 00:37:04,489
been able to shoot his own man.

473
00:37:05,657 --> 00:37:07,459
From what I could
see of the sheriff,

474
00:37:07,460 --> 00:37:09,493
he was a little too affable,

475
00:37:09,494 --> 00:37:12,497
and he seemed to
lack some backbone.

476
00:37:15,132 --> 00:37:18,901
The Apache on the other
hand was another story.

477
00:37:18,902 --> 00:37:20,738
There was a lot more to
him than he was showing us,

478
00:37:20,739 --> 00:37:22,072
that's for sure.

479
00:37:36,755 --> 00:37:37,689
Nice gun.

480
00:37:40,592 --> 00:37:41,825
Thank you.

481
00:37:41,826 --> 00:37:43,260
You're welcome.

482
00:37:44,695 --> 00:37:48,333
You're Chiricahua, how do
you find yourself so far west?

483
00:37:50,135 --> 00:37:52,902
The ones you kill capture me,

484
00:37:52,903 --> 00:37:55,738
they saw me alone,
and horse give out.

485
00:37:55,739 --> 00:38:00,143
They take me, but they get
careless and I kill them.

486
00:38:00,144 --> 00:38:02,245
But they no die.

487
00:38:02,246 --> 00:38:05,381
Then you come, then they die.

488
00:38:05,382 --> 00:38:09,052
Well, bet you'd have
done the same for me.

489
00:38:11,188 --> 00:38:12,456
How you know?

490
00:38:14,224 --> 00:38:17,561
'Cause I think,
'cause you're Datanta,

491
00:38:19,030 --> 00:38:23,201
great warrior chief of the
Chiricahua, that's what I think.

492
00:38:26,036 --> 00:38:30,207
Not tell the others, might
wanna hang me.

493
00:38:36,914 --> 00:38:39,383
Why is this happening?

494
00:38:39,384 --> 00:38:40,318
I don't know.

495
00:38:40,319 --> 00:38:43,220
Is it the end of the world?

496
00:38:43,221 --> 00:38:45,322
I don't think just yet.

497
00:38:47,425 --> 00:38:51,496
'Cause there's so much
I wanna do with my life.

498
00:38:52,563 --> 00:38:54,531
How about you?

499
00:38:54,532 --> 00:38:57,535
Being a lawman
suits me just fine.

500
00:38:59,637 --> 00:39:01,806
Me, I wanna go to France.

501
00:39:05,409 --> 00:39:06,577
Paris, France.

502
00:39:09,746 --> 00:39:12,750
City of lights is
what they call it.

503
00:39:15,286 --> 00:39:19,256
I guess I wouldn't mind
having a spread somewhere.

504
00:39:19,257 --> 00:39:20,358
Spare horses.

505
00:39:21,391 --> 00:39:22,492
It'd be okay.

506
00:39:24,429 --> 00:39:25,363
You will.

507
00:39:27,231 --> 00:39:28,233
I hope so.

508
00:39:29,900 --> 00:39:30,734
So do I.

509
00:39:34,905 --> 00:39:37,141
Well, goodnight, Marshal.

510
00:39:38,342 --> 00:39:39,642
Goodnight, you sleep well.

511
00:39:39,643 --> 00:39:41,144
I will, you too.

512
00:39:48,119 --> 00:39:49,585
Let me go on
watch for a while.

513
00:39:49,586 --> 00:39:50,521
Okay.

514
00:39:51,456 --> 00:39:53,156
What in tarnation was that?

515
00:39:53,157 --> 00:39:54,359
It ain't the walking
dead, that's for sure.

516
00:39:54,360 --> 00:39:55,558
What is it?

517
00:39:55,559 --> 00:39:57,026
Don't let them hurt me.

518
00:39:57,027 --> 00:40:00,596
Somebody's out there
shooting, that's what it is.

519
00:40:00,597 --> 00:40:02,531
If they don't hear us, they
won't know we're here, right?

520
00:40:02,532 --> 00:40:04,301
We stop wasting shots.

521
00:40:04,302 --> 00:40:05,637
Wait a minute.

522
00:40:50,681 --> 00:40:52,683
It turned
out to be just two people

523
00:40:52,684 --> 00:40:54,750
followed by a horde of zombies.

524
00:40:54,751 --> 00:40:57,287
There was more of us,
but they're gonna keep up.

525
00:40:57,288 --> 00:41:00,256
At the end it was
just me and this girl.

526
00:41:00,257 --> 00:41:02,392
They followed us all night.

527
00:41:02,393 --> 00:41:03,293
How many?

528
00:41:04,661 --> 00:41:07,263
First is wasn't too many,
they just kept coming,

529
00:41:07,264 --> 00:41:08,297
lots of them.

530
00:41:08,298 --> 00:41:09,832
Like they could smell us.

531
00:41:09,833 --> 00:41:12,069
Heading this way?

532
00:41:12,070 --> 00:41:14,138
Now we have more of
them to deal with.

533
00:41:14,139 --> 00:41:15,638
I told you...

534
00:41:15,639 --> 00:41:17,107
Well, we couldn't have
just left them out there.

535
00:41:17,108 --> 00:41:18,607
No, but...

536
00:41:18,608 --> 00:41:21,612
Hector Ruiz, thank
you for his life.

537
00:41:24,648 --> 00:41:26,384
You're Hector Ruiz?

538
00:41:27,784 --> 00:41:29,019
Yes, Marshal.

539
00:41:29,920 --> 00:41:31,254
You want my gun?

540
00:41:35,393 --> 00:41:37,127
Not just yet.

541
00:41:37,128 --> 00:41:39,129
I knew of Hector Ruiz.

542
00:41:39,130 --> 00:41:43,233
He was a Mexican gunfighter,
an outlaw, a killer.

543
00:41:48,306 --> 00:41:49,139
Hi.

544
00:41:54,211 --> 00:41:56,146
It will be okay.

545
00:41:59,217 --> 00:42:00,018
Why?

546
00:42:01,284 --> 00:42:04,021
Why do you think
it will be okay?

547
00:42:05,590 --> 00:42:09,326
I've always been this
way, optimistic I mean.

548
00:42:09,327 --> 00:42:12,497
Even when my folks died, I
knew that I would be okay.

549
00:42:12,498 --> 00:42:17,134
I mean, look around you,
everyone here will protect you.

550
00:42:17,135 --> 00:42:19,137
We're safe here for now.

551
00:42:21,105 --> 00:42:22,373
Yes, for now.

552
00:42:26,643 --> 00:42:29,111
What happened to them?

553
00:42:29,112 --> 00:42:30,747
Who?

554
00:42:30,748 --> 00:42:31,983
Your parents.

555
00:42:34,652 --> 00:42:35,987
They got sick.

556
00:42:41,592 --> 00:42:43,760
I never knew my parents.

557
00:42:45,063 --> 00:42:46,230
That's okay.

558
00:42:47,297 --> 00:42:48,899
It's gonna be okay.

559
00:42:54,871 --> 00:42:59,042
Jasper, take that out of his
mouth so he can eat, please.

560
00:43:01,711 --> 00:43:03,313
Little runt.

561
00:43:05,083 --> 00:43:08,250
Shut up or I'll
put that gag back on.

562
00:43:08,251 --> 00:43:13,223
You're just mean through
and through aren't you.

563
00:43:13,224 --> 00:43:14,826
Yes, ma'am, I am.

564
00:43:23,000 --> 00:43:25,134
There is another
way we can leave.

565
00:43:25,135 --> 00:43:26,368
Yeah?

566
00:43:26,369 --> 00:43:28,370
The railroad.

567
00:43:28,371 --> 00:43:30,040
Railroad?

568
00:43:30,041 --> 00:43:32,843
There ain't no railroad
coming during this mess.

569
00:43:32,844 --> 00:43:35,645
I know that, I'm talking
about one of the hand carts

570
00:43:35,646 --> 00:43:38,714
like the Chinese use when
they're building the line.

571
00:43:38,715 --> 00:43:39,549
So?

572
00:43:41,018 --> 00:43:44,488
Well, if we could find one,
we could escape on the tracks.

573
00:43:44,489 --> 00:43:47,556
I ain't seen one of those
around in a long time.

574
00:43:47,557 --> 00:43:50,794
I saw one on our
way here last night.

575
00:43:50,795 --> 00:43:52,895
Yes, saw it also.

576
00:43:52,896 --> 00:43:54,163
About a mile east.

577
00:43:54,164 --> 00:43:55,698
It was just sitting there.

578
00:43:55,699 --> 00:43:58,234
But we have everything
that we need right here,

579
00:43:58,235 --> 00:43:59,636
why should we go?

580
00:44:01,072 --> 00:44:03,874
Sooner or later we will
start running out of things.

581
00:44:03,875 --> 00:44:04,708
Then what?

582
00:44:05,742 --> 00:44:07,710
I agree with the preacher.

583
00:44:07,711 --> 00:44:10,647
The problem is we all
can't fit on a hand cart.

584
00:44:10,648 --> 00:44:12,517
No, but some of us
could see what's happening

585
00:44:12,518 --> 00:44:15,484
elsewhere and send us help.

586
00:44:15,485 --> 00:44:18,522
I'll tell you what's
happening everywhere else,

587
00:44:18,523 --> 00:44:20,991
same damn thing
that's happening here.

588
00:44:20,992 --> 00:44:23,326
Probably so, but
at least we could get

589
00:44:23,327 --> 00:44:26,328
the word out that some
of us have survived.

590
00:44:26,329 --> 00:44:31,499
I agree with Rose Anne,
we're safe here for now.

591
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,803
It might be a good
idea to find that thing

592
00:44:34,804 --> 00:44:36,806
just in case we need it.

593
00:44:37,942 --> 00:44:41,045
We'll go at dawn,
me, you, Wyatt, Ruiz.

594
00:44:47,784 --> 00:44:49,886
I don't want you to go.

595
00:44:49,887 --> 00:44:51,988
Jenny, I have to go.

596
00:44:51,989 --> 00:44:53,189
Says who?

597
00:44:53,190 --> 00:44:54,924
You're not a boy
any more, Wyatt.

598
00:44:54,925 --> 00:44:56,692
Nobody can tell you what to do.

599
00:44:56,693 --> 00:44:58,627
I know that.

600
00:44:58,628 --> 00:45:00,129
Then don't go.

601
00:45:00,130 --> 00:45:02,265
The marshal needs
me to go, okay?

602
00:45:02,266 --> 00:45:04,533
This is the best
thing for all of us.

603
00:45:04,534 --> 00:45:05,768
Why?

604
00:45:05,769 --> 00:45:07,404
So we can maybe
get out of here.

605
00:45:07,405 --> 00:45:08,772
And go where?

606
00:45:08,773 --> 00:45:12,509
I dunno, okay,
but we may need to.

607
00:45:12,510 --> 00:45:17,214
All right, but you
better come back in one piece.

608
00:45:17,215 --> 00:45:19,383
And don't let one of
them things bite you.

609
00:45:19,384 --> 00:45:20,984
I won't, I won't.

610
00:45:25,422 --> 00:45:26,256
Yes.

611
00:45:26,257 --> 00:45:27,090
What?

612
00:45:27,925 --> 00:45:28,993
I said yes.

613
00:45:30,193 --> 00:45:32,395
Jenny, what are
you talking about?

614
00:45:32,396 --> 00:45:34,564
Wyatt Andrews, I know you've
been working up the courage

615
00:45:34,565 --> 00:45:37,068
lately to ask me to marry you.

616
00:45:41,105 --> 00:45:42,106
Haven't you?

617
00:45:43,541 --> 00:45:45,276
Well, that is true.

618
00:45:49,512 --> 00:45:50,946
I said yes.

619
00:45:50,947 --> 00:45:53,116
The minute this is all behind
us, and I'm telling you

620
00:45:53,117 --> 00:45:55,051
this tonight because
it is one more reason

621
00:45:55,052 --> 00:45:56,687
for you to come back to me.

622
00:45:56,688 --> 00:46:00,790
And after this one time, you
never leave me alone again.

623
00:46:02,626 --> 00:46:04,326
Okay, Jenny.

624
00:46:04,327 --> 00:46:05,161
Okay.

625
00:46:10,568 --> 00:46:11,402
Are you coming?

626
00:46:11,403 --> 00:46:12,970
Yeah, I'm coming.

627
00:46:39,996 --> 00:46:41,531
I thought
the preacher was right.

628
00:46:41,532 --> 00:46:45,834
We should find that hand cart
just in case we ever need it.

629
00:46:45,835 --> 00:46:49,372
I brought Hector Ruiz along so
we could keep an eye on him.

630
00:46:49,373 --> 00:46:51,841
A man like that
wasn't to be trusted.

631
00:46:51,842 --> 00:46:55,246
He was every bit as
bad as George Rivers.

632
00:47:02,085 --> 00:47:03,953
My shoulder.

633
00:47:03,954 --> 00:47:06,856
Just lay back,
Sheriff, and rest.

634
00:47:07,958 --> 00:47:10,961
My shoulder's
killing me, Preacher.

635
00:47:14,231 --> 00:47:16,801
Can you take a drink of this?

636
00:47:25,076 --> 00:47:27,576
He's been getting worse.

637
00:47:27,577 --> 00:47:28,646
I see that.

638
00:47:30,014 --> 00:47:31,682
You all better
keep an eye on him

639
00:47:31,683 --> 00:47:35,417
'cause when he turns, he'll
come back and gobble us all up.

640
00:47:35,418 --> 00:47:36,720
You better shut.

641
00:47:36,721 --> 00:47:38,620
You better shut
up, you little runt.

642
00:47:38,621 --> 00:47:41,758
Untie me, somebody
untie me right now.

643
00:47:41,759 --> 00:47:42,859
You better sit down.

644
00:47:42,860 --> 00:47:43,993
Or what?

645
00:47:43,994 --> 00:47:46,196
What are you gonna do to me.

646
00:47:46,197 --> 00:47:48,631
What are any of
you gonna do to me?

647
00:47:48,632 --> 00:47:51,500
Big bad marshal's not
around any more is he.

648
00:47:51,501 --> 00:47:53,636
I'll shoot you.

649
00:47:53,637 --> 00:47:55,972
I don't think so, darlin'.

650
00:47:59,744 --> 00:48:02,446
If you weren't such an
evil man, we might have

651
00:48:02,447 --> 00:48:04,580
untied you long ago but...

652
00:48:04,581 --> 00:48:06,816
Shut up, old man.

653
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:10,687
Jasper, you take him in
the back and hogtie him.

654
00:48:10,688 --> 00:48:11,521
Okay.

655
00:48:13,423 --> 00:48:14,257
Come on.

656
00:48:15,291 --> 00:48:17,160
That's great.

657
00:48:17,161 --> 00:48:18,996
An Indian and a dwarf.

658
00:48:38,181 --> 00:48:40,750
Not so tough are
you now, convict?

659
00:48:40,751 --> 00:48:42,787
Consider yourself the
luckiest little boy in the world

660
00:48:42,788 --> 00:48:44,486
an Apache's standing behind you.

661
00:48:44,487 --> 00:48:46,022
Shut up, convict!

662
00:48:46,023 --> 00:48:50,392
Stuff you under the ground
like a damn little scorpion.

663
00:48:50,393 --> 00:48:54,564
Yeah, we gonna have some
fun now, aren't we convict.

664
00:48:55,733 --> 00:48:58,269
How about I gag you
right about now?

665
00:49:01,871 --> 00:49:04,074
You're a little
quieter now, son.

666
00:49:05,576 --> 00:49:09,480
It's a little harder
to hear you now, convict.

667
00:49:13,884 --> 00:49:15,286
Yeah, yeah.

668
00:49:19,222 --> 00:49:21,891
Tie you up right here like this.

669
00:49:23,327 --> 00:49:25,095
Yeah, tie that up.

670
00:49:31,268 --> 00:49:32,769
Have a nice night.

671
00:49:48,985 --> 00:49:50,419
We
traveled a good bit,

672
00:49:50,420 --> 00:49:53,022
but in the end, we found it.

673
00:51:35,592 --> 00:51:37,727
My god in heaven.

674
00:51:37,728 --> 00:51:38,561
Doc, move.

675
00:51:45,536 --> 00:51:48,137
I told you he was gonna turn.

676
00:51:58,715 --> 00:51:59,949
I'm outta here.

677
00:52:36,686 --> 00:52:38,721
Did you tie that rope
real tight, Jasper?

678
00:52:38,722 --> 00:52:41,323
Yeah, double stitch.

679
00:52:41,324 --> 00:52:43,259
He ain't getting out of that.

680
00:52:43,260 --> 00:52:44,794
Why?

681
00:52:44,795 --> 00:52:46,895
Well, we're in no danger
if we can tie his arms

682
00:52:46,896 --> 00:52:48,064
behind his...

683
00:52:48,065 --> 00:52:49,297
No danger?

684
00:52:49,298 --> 00:52:50,634
Are you serious?

685
00:52:52,302 --> 00:52:56,205
What if when this is all
over, they come back to life

686
00:52:56,206 --> 00:52:58,040
as they were.

687
00:52:58,041 --> 00:53:00,509
If we kill him,
this is our sheriff.

688
00:53:00,510 --> 00:53:03,479
He won't have that chance.

689
00:53:03,480 --> 00:53:06,381
Besides, I can study him.

690
00:53:06,382 --> 00:53:09,819
No, that's not
Sheriff Wright any more.

691
00:53:15,192 --> 00:53:16,693
Get out of here.

692
00:53:39,182 --> 00:53:40,117
Preacher.

693
00:54:00,603 --> 00:54:02,504
Jenny! Jenny!

694
00:54:02,505 --> 00:54:03,939
Quiet.

695
00:54:03,940 --> 00:54:05,441
What's going on?

696
00:54:05,442 --> 00:54:07,176
They got in the back door
and we climbed up the stairs.

697
00:54:07,177 --> 00:54:08,544
We're all right.

698
00:54:08,545 --> 00:54:10,078
They're all over
the place in there.

699
00:54:10,079 --> 00:54:12,681
Go round the back,
we'll draw 'em out.

700
00:54:12,682 --> 00:54:14,284
I'll go with you.

701
00:54:15,818 --> 00:54:17,386
Okay, don't move.

702
00:54:17,387 --> 00:54:18,989
It's gonna be okay.

703
00:54:20,590 --> 00:54:22,125
I learned early on in my life,

704
00:54:22,126 --> 00:54:25,028
the only thing that could
stop a bad man with a gun

705
00:54:25,029 --> 00:54:27,363
was a good man with a gun.

706
00:54:27,364 --> 00:54:31,200
So I trusted in my weapons
and my marksmanship.

707
00:54:31,201 --> 00:54:35,371
The same was true for these
zombies, a gun would stop them.

708
00:54:40,577 --> 00:54:42,078
They're leaving.

709
00:54:42,079 --> 00:54:45,983
Be quiet, they're
luring them out the back.

710
00:55:07,304 --> 00:55:09,538
I always wanted
to be a matador.

711
00:55:09,539 --> 00:55:11,239
Seeing him
toy with that dead girl

712
00:55:11,240 --> 00:55:12,742
turned my stomach.

713
00:55:13,911 --> 00:55:16,178
Only an evil, no
good, devious man

714
00:55:16,179 --> 00:55:18,581
would do something like that.

715
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:23,653
This is how you
do it, old man.

716
00:55:24,822 --> 00:55:26,154
Some say I
didn't help Hector Ruiz

717
00:55:26,155 --> 00:55:28,457
because he was an outlaw.

718
00:55:28,458 --> 00:55:31,093
That's not the case,
I didn't help him

719
00:55:31,094 --> 00:55:33,562
because by the time I
saw he was in trouble,

720
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:35,398
he'd already been bit.

721
00:55:58,722 --> 00:55:59,990
Wyatt?

722
00:56:08,532 --> 00:56:09,867
We're leaving.

723
00:56:11,400 --> 00:56:13,401
Well I have to say, I
agree with you, Marshal.

724
00:56:13,402 --> 00:56:16,772
Leaving town as soon as
possible is a good idea.

725
00:56:16,773 --> 00:56:18,709
Those tracks go all
the way to Tucson,

726
00:56:18,710 --> 00:56:21,243
there's bound to be more
survivors there like us.

727
00:56:21,244 --> 00:56:24,446
Problem is, we
can't all of us fit on

728
00:56:24,447 --> 00:56:27,015
that one bitty railroad cart.

729
00:56:27,016 --> 00:56:29,551
She won't take eight.

730
00:56:29,552 --> 00:56:31,121
I won't be going.

731
00:56:32,155 --> 00:56:33,922
You won't be going?

732
00:56:33,923 --> 00:56:34,757
Why not?

733
00:56:35,826 --> 00:56:37,959
I'm afraid one of them bit me.

734
00:56:37,960 --> 00:56:39,294
No.

735
00:56:39,295 --> 00:56:40,796
Yes.

736
00:56:40,797 --> 00:56:42,398
It got me good too.

737
00:56:43,567 --> 00:56:44,901
Right here on the
back of the arm

738
00:56:44,902 --> 00:56:47,270
and it's already
starting to tingle.

739
00:56:47,271 --> 00:56:50,105
I'm sorry to hear
that, Preacher.

740
00:56:50,106 --> 00:56:52,441
So am I.

741
00:56:52,442 --> 00:56:56,044
Isn't there any way to stop
it from happening to you?

742
00:56:56,045 --> 00:56:58,848
I dunno, Jenny, I've
been thinking about that.

743
00:56:58,849 --> 00:57:01,384
The transfusion of blood
might have some effect.

744
00:57:01,385 --> 00:57:04,352
At least it'd slow it down some.

745
00:57:04,353 --> 00:57:06,187
Just sorry I won't be
around with you all

746
00:57:06,188 --> 00:57:08,524
to see how it all turns out.

747
00:57:09,927 --> 00:57:11,192
They got me too.

748
00:57:11,193 --> 00:57:13,162
You too?

749
00:57:13,163 --> 00:57:14,231
Jasper, no!

750
00:57:18,702 --> 00:57:19,970
On the ankle.

751
00:57:21,405 --> 00:57:24,774
Well, it looks like
it's you and me, Jasper.

752
00:57:24,775 --> 00:57:26,609
Will that make enough
room on the cart?

753
00:57:26,610 --> 00:57:28,743
Can we do six?

754
00:57:28,744 --> 00:57:30,913
Probably you can do six.

755
00:57:32,181 --> 00:57:33,015
Good.

756
00:57:34,650 --> 00:57:36,953
That was bad news
to hear because by this point

757
00:57:36,954 --> 00:57:40,957
I liked Jasper and the
preacher very much.

758
00:57:40,958 --> 00:57:45,060
You're gonna stick that
thing into our arm, Preacher?

759
00:57:45,061 --> 00:57:47,796
Yes, shall I go first?

760
00:57:47,797 --> 00:57:49,465
No, I'll go first.

761
00:57:53,704 --> 00:57:55,837
Are you ready?

762
00:57:55,838 --> 00:57:57,372
Be gentle.

763
00:57:57,373 --> 00:58:00,977
How is he gonna be
gentle with that thing?

764
00:58:03,947 --> 00:58:06,916
I'll be as gentle
as I can, Jasper.

765
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:11,253
I always wanted to
run this experiment,

766
00:58:12,356 --> 00:58:15,290
I just didn't think
it'd be on me.

767
00:58:15,291 --> 00:58:16,125
And me.

768
00:58:27,804 --> 00:58:30,071
How you holding up, Jasper?

769
00:58:30,072 --> 00:58:32,640
I don't feel anything.

770
00:58:32,641 --> 00:58:35,877
Hey, I want you
to do me a favor.

771
00:58:35,878 --> 00:58:36,712
Okay.

772
00:58:38,114 --> 00:58:41,484
I want you to look out
for Rose Anne when I'm gone.

773
00:58:41,485 --> 00:58:42,318
Sure.

774
00:58:44,387 --> 00:58:46,921
I seen the way
she looks at you.

775
00:58:46,922 --> 00:58:48,691
She's sweet on you.

776
00:58:48,692 --> 00:58:53,428
Don't look so surprised, I seen
the way you look at her too.

777
00:58:53,429 --> 00:58:55,663
Well, she is a fine woman.

778
00:58:55,664 --> 00:58:57,966
Cut the crap.

779
00:58:57,967 --> 00:59:01,037
She's the best woman
in the whole world.

780
00:59:01,038 --> 00:59:04,205
I always thought I'd
have a chance with her.

781
00:59:04,206 --> 00:59:08,377
But now, well you know, just,
you've gotta look out for her.

782
00:59:10,614 --> 00:59:12,282
Treat her real good.

783
00:59:13,483 --> 00:59:14,582
Sure, okay.

784
00:59:14,583 --> 00:59:15,751
Shake on it.

785
00:59:17,186 --> 00:59:18,287
You treat her good.

786
00:59:18,288 --> 00:59:19,789
Yeah, I promise.

787
00:59:36,773 --> 00:59:38,275
How you feelin'?

788
00:59:39,576 --> 00:59:42,477
A little woozy but all right.

789
00:59:42,478 --> 00:59:46,415
Starting to think
this just might work.

790
00:59:46,416 --> 00:59:47,883
The infection's not as rapid

791
00:59:47,884 --> 00:59:50,718
as with Deputy Clem
and the sheriff.

792
00:59:50,719 --> 00:59:52,455
God rest their souls.

793
00:59:53,889 --> 00:59:56,491
You want us to wait and see.

794
00:59:56,492 --> 00:59:59,261
I'm afraid we'd both
be too weary to partake

795
00:59:59,262 --> 01:00:02,297
in such an arduous journey.

796
01:00:02,298 --> 01:00:06,469
Besides, I don't wanna be
remembered as one of them.

797
01:00:07,903 --> 01:00:09,338
Okay, Preacher.

798
01:00:17,780 --> 01:00:21,951
There's something that, something
that I want you to know.

799
01:00:25,621 --> 01:00:28,357
If we make it, I
want you to know

800
01:00:34,164 --> 01:00:37,834
in spite of everything
that's just happened,

801
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:42,172
I have feelings for you.

802
01:00:48,911 --> 01:00:50,413
You're a good man.

803
01:00:55,217 --> 01:00:59,388
And I would really liked to
have gotten to know you better.

804
01:01:01,056 --> 01:01:03,959
Who said we're
not gonna make it?

805
01:01:06,829 --> 01:01:08,498
We're gonna make it.

806
01:01:09,666 --> 01:01:12,935
So I hope you meant
what you just said

807
01:01:12,936 --> 01:01:15,939
because I have
feelings for you too.

808
01:01:18,307 --> 01:01:20,744
So we're gonna make it, okay?

809
01:01:22,077 --> 01:01:22,913
All right.

810
01:01:22,914 --> 01:01:23,746
Okay.

811
01:01:23,747 --> 01:01:25,581
We're gonna make it.

812
01:01:33,923 --> 01:01:36,992
I promise you, we're
gonna make I it.

813
01:01:37,994 --> 01:01:39,162
Bye, Jasper.

814
01:01:41,364 --> 01:01:43,699
I don't know how to do this,

815
01:01:45,501 --> 01:01:48,170
I don't know how to say goodbye.

816
01:01:50,039 --> 01:01:51,208
I love you so.

817
01:01:53,577 --> 01:01:56,477
And I love you, Rose Anne.

818
01:01:56,478 --> 01:01:57,980
I...

819
01:01:57,981 --> 01:02:00,783
Maybe the preacher's
experiment will work out.

820
01:02:00,784 --> 01:02:02,251
That we'll be okay.

821
01:02:09,492 --> 01:02:10,526
We'll be here.

822
01:02:10,527 --> 01:02:12,227
You'll be back for us?

823
01:02:12,228 --> 01:02:14,562
We'll be back as
soon as we're ready.

824
01:02:14,563 --> 01:02:17,633
I hope you find us as we are.

825
01:02:17,634 --> 01:02:19,401
Me too, Preacher.

826
01:02:19,402 --> 01:02:20,237
Good luck.

827
01:02:21,371 --> 01:02:22,204
Good luck.

828
01:02:54,570 --> 01:02:55,803
As we moved out,
I was struck by

829
01:02:55,804 --> 01:02:57,806
how easy they went down.

830
01:02:58,675 --> 01:02:59,776
The problem would come

831
01:02:59,777 --> 01:03:02,477
if you ever encountered
a mob of them.

832
01:03:02,478 --> 01:03:04,946
If this was happening
elsewhere, I couldn't help

833
01:03:04,947 --> 01:03:08,183
but wonder how it
was in big cities.

834
01:03:42,152 --> 01:03:44,752
It felt good getting
on the hand cart.

835
01:03:44,753 --> 01:03:47,356
It felt like an accomplishment.

836
01:04:18,054 --> 01:04:22,024
We moved on, putting some
distance between us and Crumpit

837
01:04:22,025 --> 01:04:25,593
and for a while the world
seemed normal again.

838
01:04:25,594 --> 01:04:28,097
And then we saw them up ahead.

839
01:05:27,423 --> 01:05:28,257
Good shot.

840
01:05:34,664 --> 01:05:36,431
Looks like
we're gonna make it.

841
01:05:36,432 --> 01:05:38,634
Yeah, I think so.

842
01:05:38,635 --> 01:05:41,470
You know, for a while
there, I had some doubts.

843
01:05:41,471 --> 01:05:42,738
Me too.

844
01:05:42,739 --> 01:05:43,673
Without you and your
shots, I don't think

845
01:05:43,674 --> 01:05:45,207
we'd even be talking right now.

846
01:05:45,208 --> 01:05:47,710
Happy to be of service, sir.

847
01:06:10,032 --> 01:06:12,234
It's the blasted flywheel.

848
01:06:12,235 --> 01:06:13,470
We can crank this
thing to kingdom come,

849
01:06:13,471 --> 01:06:15,703
we ain't going nowhere.

850
01:06:15,704 --> 01:06:17,139
Can you fix it?

851
01:06:18,541 --> 01:06:19,375
No, sir.

852
01:06:22,211 --> 01:06:23,045
We walk.

853
01:06:25,347 --> 01:06:26,181
No.

854
01:06:27,317 --> 01:06:28,150
We walk.

855
01:06:50,273 --> 01:06:52,808
Losing the hand
cart was a real blow.

856
01:06:52,809 --> 01:06:55,879
We had no choice
but to just walk on.

857
01:07:55,804 --> 01:07:56,638
Behind!

858
01:07:58,740 --> 01:08:00,677
Wyatt, get up!

859
01:08:58,333 --> 01:09:00,035
I was
never, in all my life,

860
01:09:00,036 --> 01:09:03,338
so happy to see an
Apache raiding party.

861
01:09:05,375 --> 01:09:08,778
Datanta we been
tracking you many days.

862
01:09:11,514 --> 01:09:13,148
It's good to see
you, my brother.

863
01:09:13,149 --> 01:09:15,117
It's good to see
you also, White Face.

864
01:09:15,118 --> 01:09:16,686
Datanta thanks you.

865
01:09:24,260 --> 01:09:27,062
No, these people saved my life.

866
01:09:27,063 --> 01:09:30,065
They are friends
of the Chiricahuas.

867
01:09:42,011 --> 01:09:44,580
You are a good war chief,
I would ride with you

868
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:46,415
against my enemies.

869
01:09:46,416 --> 01:09:48,351
And I would ride
with you, Datanta.

870
01:09:48,352 --> 01:09:51,621
I will keep this
gun to remember you.

871
01:10:05,568 --> 01:10:08,304
I
can't believe it.

872
01:10:17,779 --> 01:10:20,215
I didn't
know what our future held

873
01:10:20,216 --> 01:10:24,185
but I knew that there were
dark days ahead for sure.

874
01:10:24,186 --> 01:10:27,322
This new world would
not be an easy place.

875
01:10:27,323 --> 01:10:29,659
But so far, we had survived.
