1
00:01:04,798 --> 00:01:09,094
I heard you interfering little bastards
rummage around my yard.

2
00:01:09,177 --> 00:01:12,931
I'll thank you for keeping
the owls off of my cats.

3
00:01:42,169 --> 00:01:44,339
You sleep OK?

4
00:01:46,299 --> 00:01:48,634
Sorta.

5
00:01:54,557 --> 00:01:56,684
I, uh...

6
00:01:56,767 --> 00:01:59,645
(man) God, Jean,
I don't know what happened.

7
00:01:59,729 --> 00:02:02,732
It's like a red mist or...

8
00:02:03,899 --> 00:02:07,320
Something comes over me and I...

9
00:02:09,030 --> 00:02:12,992
But I feel like you backed me up
in a corner and I...

10
00:02:13,993 --> 00:02:16,079
You do that, and uh...

11
00:02:17,037 --> 00:02:18,831
I hate it when I'm like that.

12
00:02:32,553 --> 00:02:34,180
I'm sorry.

13
00:02:38,476 --> 00:02:40,769
Can you forgive me?

14
00:02:49,738 --> 00:02:51,656
What?!

15
00:02:56,495 --> 00:02:58,205
Fuck!

16
00:03:04,461 --> 00:03:06,755
(girl) You promised...

17
00:03:06,838 --> 00:03:09,591
if it happened again...

18
00:03:09,633 --> 00:03:11,551
You promised.

19
00:03:12,468 --> 00:03:16,473
(woman) OK, this is last week
and up to yesterday.

20
00:03:16,515 --> 00:03:17,891
- All right?
- OK.

21
00:03:17,974 --> 00:03:21,061
- I stuck an extra 50 bucks in there.
- Kitty, I can't...

22
00:03:21,144 --> 00:03:23,396
- You can. Listen...
- Here, just take it.

23
00:03:23,438 --> 00:03:26,775
I don't wanna see you coming around here
anymore looking like this.

24
00:03:28,526 --> 00:03:31,947
You take care.
Take care of that girl. Get going. OK.

25
00:03:32,030 --> 00:03:34,658
(woman) We have a reciprocity
agreement with Kansas.

26
00:03:34,742 --> 00:03:36,785
If you can stay in this shelter for a week.

27
00:03:36,869 --> 00:03:39,412
- I could find you a place in Wichita.
- No.

28
00:03:39,496 --> 00:03:43,249
Every man in town who beats a woman
knows where this shelter is.

29
00:03:43,333 --> 00:03:45,085
Do you have someone you can stay with?

30
00:03:45,168 --> 00:03:48,171
(man) I don't think you really understand
just how worried I am.

31
00:03:48,213 --> 00:03:50,132
I don't know.
Maybe they went shopping.

32
00:03:50,215 --> 00:03:53,969
I wish someone in this goddamn place
would just...

33
00:03:54,052 --> 00:03:56,764
would just give me the truth.

34
00:03:59,016 --> 00:04:01,769
Then we could find Jean
pretty damn quick.

35
00:04:06,732 --> 00:04:09,443
(girl) Tribune, Kansas.
Do you wanna go there?

36
00:04:09,485 --> 00:04:13,030
(Jean) Sure. Maybe. I mean,
we can go anywhere we want.

37
00:04:13,113 --> 00:04:15,992
How about Loving, New Mexico?

38
00:04:18,035 --> 00:04:20,496
- I like that.
- Me too.

39
00:04:21,997 --> 00:04:24,249
Topeka.

40
00:04:24,792 --> 00:04:26,211
Santa Cruz.

41
00:04:26,294 --> 00:04:29,588
Oh, my gosh.
There's a Butt, Montana.

42
00:04:29,671 --> 00:04:32,550
- It's pronounced "Bute."
- (car engine rattles)

43
00:04:32,591 --> 00:04:34,927
- Mom?
- Oh, no. No!

44
00:04:43,561 --> 00:04:45,354
(motorcycle approaches)

45
00:04:50,151 --> 00:04:52,195
Hey!

46
00:04:53,445 --> 00:04:58,075
She's not going anywhere.
There's a rod sticking through the block.

47
00:04:58,117 --> 00:05:00,327
I'm heading to Sioux Falls.

48
00:05:01,662 --> 00:05:02,997
Yeah.

49
00:05:04,665 --> 00:05:06,959
Just take what you need.

50
00:05:16,595 --> 00:05:19,305
So one inch is 83 miles.

51
00:05:23,102 --> 00:05:26,312
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten.

52
00:05:28,064 --> 00:05:30,233
Aloha, Oregon.

53
00:05:32,778 --> 00:05:34,780
It's only ten inches away.

54
00:05:35,572 --> 00:05:40,660
So that's 830 miles
and we've already gone 300 miles...

55
00:05:40,702 --> 00:05:43,455
We're going to Wyoming.

56
00:06:15,654 --> 00:06:17,906
(girl) What's in Wyoming?

57
00:06:19,366 --> 00:06:22,245
It's where your grandfather lives.

58
00:06:24,205 --> 00:06:26,249
I have a grandfather?

59
00:06:27,834 --> 00:06:29,877
Not much of one.

60
00:06:32,838 --> 00:06:35,008
When were you going to tell me?

61
00:06:40,513 --> 00:06:42,557
Oh, I'm fine.

62
00:06:45,392 --> 00:06:47,436
Smells like rain.

63
00:06:47,478 --> 00:06:49,731
It's not gonna rain today.

64
00:06:52,358 --> 00:06:55,820
You haven't been right
about the weather since 1972.

65
00:06:55,903 --> 00:06:58,113
I know what rain looks like.

66
00:07:01,325 --> 00:07:04,329
You got something
on your mind this morning?

67
00:07:04,412 --> 00:07:07,123
The goddamn bear's back.

68
00:07:10,459 --> 00:07:13,713
Well, what do you think
you're gonna do about it?

69
00:07:13,796 --> 00:07:15,923
What I should have done a year ago.

70
00:07:28,352 --> 00:07:30,272
(growls)

71
00:07:48,374 --> 00:07:52,753
Did anyone notice if he had cubs?
Did you see cubs with him?

72
00:07:55,923 --> 00:07:57,716
(siren)

73
00:08:26,786 --> 00:08:28,329
OK.

74
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,810
- It's under control, Einar.
- You get out of the way and it will be.

75
00:08:49,894 --> 00:08:53,397
Come on, let's let
the Fish and Game take care of this.

76
00:08:55,233 --> 00:08:57,276
This isn't some pet dog they're after.

77
00:08:57,318 --> 00:09:01,238
I think they can tell
the difference, all right?

78
00:09:01,990 --> 00:09:04,117
That says what
a college education gets you.

79
00:09:04,158 --> 00:09:06,035
(man) Here we go.

80
00:09:06,077 --> 00:09:08,454
(dart gun fired. Bear growls)

81
00:09:14,293 --> 00:09:16,211
(car horn)

82
00:09:21,717 --> 00:09:23,302
Mom.

83
00:09:23,385 --> 00:09:25,304
Welcome to Wyoming.

84
00:09:26,764 --> 00:09:29,099
Mom, this is us.

85
00:09:32,853 --> 00:09:35,231
So is my grandpa nice?

86
00:09:38,693 --> 00:09:41,237
Why didn't you tell me about him?

87
00:09:53,334 --> 00:09:54,918
(Jean) Einar!

88
00:10:15,439 --> 00:10:17,441
I don't want you here.

89
00:10:19,151 --> 00:10:21,820
At least we agree on something.

90
00:10:21,903 --> 00:10:24,239
I don't wanna be here either.

91
00:10:25,824 --> 00:10:28,952
We need a place to stay
for about a month or so.

92
00:10:29,827 --> 00:10:33,874
Looks like you need every part
of your head examined.

93
00:10:34,499 --> 00:10:36,418
Is this yours?

94
00:10:38,170 --> 00:10:40,255
She's yours too.

95
00:10:44,050 --> 00:10:48,304
You telling me I have a grandchild
I don't know about?

96
00:10:49,347 --> 00:10:53,810
I'm telling you
I was pregnant at Griffin's funeral.

97
00:10:53,893 --> 00:10:55,812
Where you been till now?

98
00:10:57,188 --> 00:10:59,358
We've been on the road for two days.

99
00:11:00,234 --> 00:11:02,278
We lived in lowa.

100
00:11:03,070 --> 00:11:05,615
Now this suddenly seems like home?

101
00:11:06,157 --> 00:11:08,033
What's her name?

102
00:11:08,075 --> 00:11:10,119
My name's Griff.

103
00:11:11,203 --> 00:11:13,289
Griff Gilkyson.

104
00:11:14,332 --> 00:11:16,501
That's an unusual name for a girl.

105
00:11:18,461 --> 00:11:20,504
Einar, please.

106
00:11:21,338 --> 00:11:24,216
Just till I can earn enough
to get us out of here.

107
00:11:48,449 --> 00:11:50,951
There's a room in the basement.

108
00:12:13,642 --> 00:12:15,560
I'm sorry.

109
00:12:29,658 --> 00:12:33,495
Hey. I'm gonna go into town
and look for a job.

110
00:12:33,579 --> 00:12:36,289
You think you'll be all right here?

111
00:12:36,372 --> 00:12:39,209
All right, well, just... be good.

112
00:12:40,460 --> 00:12:42,378
Love you.

113
00:13:02,816 --> 00:13:04,735
(toilet flushes)

114
00:13:08,572 --> 00:13:10,615
I used the bathroom.

115
00:13:10,699 --> 00:13:12,617
I heard you.

116
00:13:15,244 --> 00:13:18,123
- Are you hungry?
- Not yet.

117
00:13:22,253 --> 00:13:24,505
Is there a McDonald's in town?

118
00:13:24,588 --> 00:13:27,758
- You got five dollars?
- No, I don't.

119
00:13:27,800 --> 00:13:33,764
Well, then I don't think going into town
for a meal would be a very good idea.

120
00:13:42,731 --> 00:13:44,650
How was your night?

121
00:13:45,484 --> 00:13:47,611
All right, I guess.

122
00:13:47,695 --> 00:13:49,780
Left or right?

123
00:13:52,115 --> 00:13:54,034
Let's do the right.

124
00:13:54,117 --> 00:13:56,162
Left could use a rest.

125
00:14:01,458 --> 00:14:02,918
(winces)

126
00:14:02,960 --> 00:14:05,546
Pain bad all the time now?

127
00:14:05,630 --> 00:14:07,631
Gets my full attention.

128
00:14:07,715 --> 00:14:09,091
Yep.

129
00:14:17,349 --> 00:14:19,268
What happened with my bear?

130
00:14:19,351 --> 00:14:21,353
It's his own damn bear.

131
00:14:21,436 --> 00:14:23,606
You telling me he's still alive?

132
00:14:23,689 --> 00:14:26,859
He's fine.
He's in that zoo Angie built.

133
00:14:47,798 --> 00:14:50,050
Dreaming about the sea last night.

134
00:14:50,550 --> 00:14:53,428
- Did you get wet?
- (laughs)

135
00:14:54,137 --> 00:14:56,347
I walked right in.

136
00:14:58,559 --> 00:15:00,769
Felt like falling in love.

137
00:15:03,896 --> 00:15:06,191
Smelled like a woman.

138
00:15:07,108 --> 00:15:09,235
Tasted like one too.

139
00:15:09,318 --> 00:15:11,571
Your memory's not that good.

140
00:15:13,030 --> 00:15:14,741
Hey.

141
00:15:16,076 --> 00:15:17,952
Down there.

142
00:15:19,662 --> 00:15:21,789
See Jean kept her looks.

143
00:15:23,833 --> 00:15:26,294
Said she brought her daughter with her.

144
00:15:26,378 --> 00:15:28,505
She says it's Griffin's.

145
00:15:29,589 --> 00:15:31,507
Granddaughter.

146
00:15:32,842 --> 00:15:35,762
That's a nice thing for a man to have.

147
00:15:38,139 --> 00:15:40,767
I might go into town for breakfast.

148
00:15:41,560 --> 00:15:43,479
All right.

149
00:15:46,774 --> 00:15:49,401
Taking the girl with you?

150
00:15:49,485 --> 00:15:51,695
Anything else you need?

151
00:15:53,906 --> 00:15:55,700
Yeah, look in on the bear.

152
00:15:58,119 --> 00:16:00,997
- What?
- Check on the bear.

153
00:16:01,080 --> 00:16:05,042
Check on the?
Why the hell would I do that?

154
00:16:05,126 --> 00:16:06,919
'Cause I asked you to.

155
00:16:51,214 --> 00:16:52,841
(door opens)

156
00:16:59,722 --> 00:17:01,767
Are those my dad's things?

157
00:17:02,892 --> 00:17:04,686
Yeah, they are.

158
00:17:04,769 --> 00:17:06,813
Where does he live now?

159
00:17:08,815 --> 00:17:12,402
He's dead.
Didn't your mother tell you that?

160
00:17:13,236 --> 00:17:15,697
Yeah. But she said you were dead too.

161
00:17:18,950 --> 00:17:23,288
Are you confused about why they call
a room with a table in it a dining room?

162
00:17:23,371 --> 00:17:25,248
No, sir.

163
00:17:30,837 --> 00:17:34,632
Since it looks like you didn't have
any trouble making that sandwich,

164
00:17:34,674 --> 00:17:38,177
I'd like you to make another one at 11:30.
Will you do that?

165
00:17:38,261 --> 00:17:41,764
- Yes, sir.
- And take it to that man in the little house.

166
00:17:41,806 --> 00:17:44,017
And a glass of milk.

167
00:17:44,059 --> 00:17:45,977
Yes, sir.

168
00:17:48,021 --> 00:17:51,525
Bear? Goddamnit. (mumbles)

169
00:17:51,608 --> 00:17:53,860
"Go check on the bear."

170
00:17:53,943 --> 00:17:55,820
(engine fails to start)

171
00:18:04,622 --> 00:18:06,540
(ignition fails again)

172
00:18:08,626 --> 00:18:10,544
Goddamnit.

173
00:18:32,608 --> 00:18:35,235
Nice wheels, Einar!

174
00:18:35,277 --> 00:18:37,572
Where did you get the rig?

175
00:18:37,655 --> 00:18:42,367
Nancy Sidwell had this shipped up from
that retirement village where Ernie died.

176
00:18:42,451 --> 00:18:44,996
Maybe it was the bike killed Ernie.

177
00:18:45,079 --> 00:18:49,041
What killed Ernie was
a lifetime of Nancy's cooking.

178
00:18:49,124 --> 00:18:52,920
- Your pickup broke down again?
- Oh, hell, no. Pickup's fine.

179
00:18:53,003 --> 00:18:56,007
I'm just out here training
for a goddamn marathon.

180
00:18:56,048 --> 00:19:02,221
I like the flag. Without an orange flag
like that, you might look ridiculous.

181
00:19:28,289 --> 00:19:31,001
- Hello, Ken, Catherine.
- Einar.

182
00:19:34,588 --> 00:19:36,673
What have I got? Bills.

183
00:19:38,258 --> 00:19:41,678
- Morning, Einar.
- Morning yourself, Nina.

184
00:19:41,762 --> 00:19:44,389
Do you believe they're still
sending junk mail to my boy?

185
00:19:44,472 --> 00:19:48,059
Well, maybe the dead are flattered
to get a letter. Ever think about that?

186
00:19:48,143 --> 00:19:50,395
I'll let you know when I'm gone.

187
00:19:50,478 --> 00:19:53,773
Maybe I'll send you a postcard
from the other side.

188
00:19:53,856 --> 00:19:56,360
Hey, how's Mitch doing?

189
00:19:56,401 --> 00:19:58,320
Mitch - he's dreaming about the sea.

190
00:19:58,403 --> 00:20:01,239
Oh, yeah?
I used to live by the ocean.

191
00:20:01,322 --> 00:20:03,532
Up in Oregon for about a year.

192
00:20:03,574 --> 00:20:07,662
Yeah, too much rain if you ask me.
But I sure like the sound it makes.

193
00:20:07,746 --> 00:20:10,081
- Grandma.
- What's up?

194
00:20:10,164 --> 00:20:13,835
If you get depressed, pull up a chair
to your kitchen sink and turn on the tap.

195
00:20:13,918 --> 00:20:17,130
If I ever get depressed,
remind me not to come to you for advice.

196
00:20:17,213 --> 00:20:19,716
(laughter) Hey!

197
00:20:21,218 --> 00:20:25,139
I wonder if it's hard being that drunk
this early in the morning.

198
00:20:25,222 --> 00:20:27,767
Oh, it's easy if you
don't stop drinking all night.

199
00:20:27,850 --> 00:20:32,021
- You'd know. How do you want your eggs?
- Scrambled.

200
00:20:33,021 --> 00:20:36,984
Hey, there, boys.
What can I get you this morning?

201
00:20:37,985 --> 00:20:42,406
Get down on this table and I can see if
I can stay on you till the buzzer sounds.

202
00:20:42,448 --> 00:20:44,909
Agh! I hope you're
having a lot of fun, Chris,

203
00:20:44,992 --> 00:20:49,288
'cause soon as I get one arm free,
I'm gonna kick your sorry ass.

204
00:20:49,371 --> 00:20:51,666
Oh, now look
what you went and did!

205
00:20:52,875 --> 00:20:54,543
Good morning, fellas.

206
00:20:54,626 --> 00:20:56,878
I'm gonna be your new waiter.
Want some coffee?

207
00:20:56,962 --> 00:21:00,632
- Why don't you screw off, you old bastard?
- What?

208
00:21:04,887 --> 00:21:07,931
Son, now I don't wanna
work myself short of breath.

209
00:21:08,015 --> 00:21:11,310
You wanna continue this?
It can be over all at once.

210
00:21:11,393 --> 00:21:14,313
Because that's how goddamn fast
your life can change.

211
00:21:14,396 --> 00:21:16,356
You believe me?

212
00:21:21,237 --> 00:21:23,447
Sorry for the mess.

213
00:21:45,428 --> 00:21:47,430
- Hi.
- Hi.

214
00:21:54,771 --> 00:21:56,815
My name's Griff.

215
00:21:56,856 --> 00:21:58,775
My name is Mitch.

216
00:21:59,568 --> 00:22:01,486
That for me?

217
00:22:09,702 --> 00:22:11,121
Thank you.

218
00:22:15,208 --> 00:22:17,710
Yeah, I know.

219
00:22:17,793 --> 00:22:21,422
I almost threw up
first time I looked at it.

220
00:22:21,505 --> 00:22:23,967
You feeling a little queasy?

221
00:22:24,008 --> 00:22:26,052
I'm fine.

222
00:22:26,135 --> 00:22:28,012
OK.

223
00:22:29,055 --> 00:22:32,308
I got queasy first time
I saw a man eat a snail.

224
00:22:32,391 --> 00:22:35,019
- You ever eat a snail?
- No.

225
00:22:35,603 --> 00:22:38,148
Me neither.
This looks good.

226
00:22:42,695 --> 00:22:47,074
- What happened to you?
- I was mauled by a bear.

227
00:22:47,658 --> 00:22:49,785
I saw a bear in a cage yesterday.

228
00:22:49,827 --> 00:22:51,912
Yeah. That was my bear.

229
00:22:53,664 --> 00:22:57,876
About a year ago, he was eating
one of your grandfather's calves

230
00:22:57,960 --> 00:23:02,923
and... well, we sort of
interrupted his dinner, you know.

231
00:23:03,007 --> 00:23:06,052
He thought we were
gonna take it away from him.

232
00:23:06,135 --> 00:23:08,845
You know bears -
they don't like to share.

233
00:23:11,139 --> 00:23:13,142
Did the bear bite Einar?

234
00:23:13,851 --> 00:23:16,353
No, I was closer.

235
00:23:18,355 --> 00:23:21,775
- I didn't know anyone ate snails.
- Oh, yeah, sure.

236
00:23:21,858 --> 00:23:24,987
In those fancy restaurants
up in Cheyenne,

237
00:23:25,028 --> 00:23:29,199
they eat 'em all the time
like there's nothing to it.

238
00:23:32,411 --> 00:23:34,413
Once I saw this kid eat a moth.

239
00:23:35,247 --> 00:23:38,417
- You could hear the crunch.
- Oh, no, no!

240
00:23:44,798 --> 00:23:46,258
(growling)

241
00:23:46,342 --> 00:23:48,970
(child) Oh, my gosh! Look at that!

242
00:23:50,555 --> 00:23:52,390
(woman) Einar.

243
00:23:52,432 --> 00:23:54,267
Hey, Angie.

244
00:23:54,309 --> 00:23:56,936
I didn't expect to see you in this crowd.

245
00:23:57,019 --> 00:24:01,566
I guess at my age it's good
to be seen just about anywhere.

246
00:24:02,275 --> 00:24:05,320
Well, Fish and Game
said he'd settle down in a few days.

247
00:24:05,403 --> 00:24:09,324
Of course, they also said
he'd eat anything, which he doesn't.

248
00:24:09,407 --> 00:24:16,456
I don't get it. Nobody would pay five dollars
for the mountain lion I used to keep in here.

249
00:24:16,539 --> 00:24:18,583
How's Mitch?

250
00:24:18,624 --> 00:24:20,960
He's dreaming about the sea.

251
00:24:21,836 --> 00:24:23,713
I always wanted a boat.

252
00:24:23,755 --> 00:24:26,550
My dad used to take us out.
It was so great.

253
00:24:26,633 --> 00:24:28,718
What happened to the lion?

254
00:24:29,677 --> 00:24:31,596
He died.

255
00:24:33,681 --> 00:24:35,725
Lucky lion.

256
00:24:35,767 --> 00:24:37,853
(growling)

257
00:24:43,608 --> 00:24:45,610
Hello, Griffin.

258
00:25:00,209 --> 00:25:04,880
Well, it says here you might have
already won $15 million.

259
00:25:05,673 --> 00:25:08,675
Probably ought to
send it in for you, though.

260
00:25:08,759 --> 00:25:12,638
Probably the same damn odds
as losing a kid early.

261
00:25:12,722 --> 00:25:14,598
You got that done.

262
00:25:18,019 --> 00:25:20,896
You should know
your wife came back.

263
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:31,115
You could have steered her
someplace else.

264
00:25:31,198 --> 00:25:35,827
Just 'cause you're dead
doesn't mean you can't be useful.

265
00:25:38,289 --> 00:25:40,458
See you tomorrow, boy.

266
00:25:44,545 --> 00:25:48,007
Kid sure looks a whole lot
like you, though.

267
00:25:49,425 --> 00:25:51,343
Top to bottom.

268
00:25:54,889 --> 00:25:56,849
(Griff) Mom!

269
00:25:57,808 --> 00:25:59,685
- Hey!
- I missed you.

270
00:25:59,768 --> 00:26:01,561
- Guess what. I got a job.
- Really?

271
00:26:01,645 --> 00:26:04,607
I start tomorrow.
So how was your day?

272
00:26:06,567 --> 00:26:08,277
Not so great, huh?

273
00:26:11,072 --> 00:26:12,949
(hammering)

274
00:26:57,327 --> 00:26:59,204
Man, I'm tired.

275
00:27:00,371 --> 00:27:05,251
I think half the people we served
this morning came in just to look at you.

276
00:27:05,335 --> 00:27:07,712
(Nina) Here you go.

277
00:27:07,795 --> 00:27:10,757
- What's this?
- Your half of the tips.

278
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,637
I thought you said
you were used to being on your feet.

279
00:27:16,721 --> 00:27:20,851
I'm not used to telling everyone I meet
where I've been the last ten years.

280
00:27:20,892 --> 00:27:22,394
Well...

281
00:27:22,477 --> 00:27:24,188
Tell 'em you went crazy.

282
00:27:25,106 --> 00:27:27,608
Tell 'em you've been locked up.

283
00:27:29,318 --> 00:27:31,487
That's what I've been telling 'em.

284
00:27:31,570 --> 00:27:33,572
(Nina) Looks like we did real good today.

285
00:27:33,655 --> 00:27:36,117
Guess I got you to thank for that.

286
00:27:36,200 --> 00:27:39,369
Maybe I'll have some music
on Saturday night.

287
00:27:39,452 --> 00:27:44,583
Of course, then again,
you'd have to dance with Billy and Wayne.

288
00:27:45,209 --> 00:27:47,378
Oh, that'd be a sight.

289
00:28:02,184 --> 00:28:04,103
Can I help you?

290
00:28:06,521 --> 00:28:08,690
I'm Einar Gilkyson's daughter-in-law.

291
00:28:08,732 --> 00:28:11,860
Yes, I know.
Did you want to come in?

292
00:28:14,780 --> 00:28:16,865
Thank you.

293
00:28:16,949 --> 00:28:18,867
- Any calls?
- Nothing.

294
00:28:23,496 --> 00:28:25,749
Homemade lunch, you know.

295
00:28:32,215 --> 00:28:35,593
You got something there
you want me to see?

296
00:28:41,766 --> 00:28:45,478
It's a police report.
But I didn't press charges.

297
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:51,568
A shelter worker in lowa thought I ought to
check in with authorities when I got settled.

298
00:28:52,693 --> 00:28:55,405
He was my boyfriend.

299
00:28:55,447 --> 00:28:57,532
But, um...

300
00:28:57,615 --> 00:29:00,117
The report's not for this time.

301
00:29:00,910 --> 00:29:02,996
It was for another time.

302
00:29:06,166 --> 00:29:08,251
I'll make a copy.

303
00:29:20,263 --> 00:29:21,431
That's it.

304
00:29:26,478 --> 00:29:28,521
What are their names?

305
00:29:29,438 --> 00:29:31,941
- Who?
- Your cats.

306
00:29:32,984 --> 00:29:35,695
They don't have any names.

307
00:29:37,530 --> 00:29:39,367
How do you tell 'em apart?

308
00:29:40,242 --> 00:29:42,202
I don't tell 'em apart.

309
00:29:48,208 --> 00:29:52,046
Goddamn cheap-ass, Mickey Mouse,
foreign goddamn part...

310
00:29:52,129 --> 00:29:54,340
Oscar and Charlie.

311
00:29:54,423 --> 00:29:56,425
Hi, Charlie.

312
00:29:56,508 --> 00:29:59,052
Is that there a water-pump belt?

313
00:30:00,012 --> 00:30:02,389
Why don't you use the one
out on the tractor?

314
00:30:02,472 --> 00:30:04,433
Why don't I use the one
out on the tractor?

315
00:30:04,516 --> 00:30:07,603
Hey, are you mumbling
over there or something?

316
00:30:07,686 --> 00:30:09,896
The tractor belt's twice this size.

317
00:30:09,980 --> 00:30:11,732
- Really?
- Yeah.

318
00:30:11,773 --> 00:30:13,650
Oh.

319
00:30:14,360 --> 00:30:16,862
Don't we have some
spare belts in the barn?

320
00:30:16,945 --> 00:30:20,782
I got a great idea.
Why don't you go back in the house?

321
00:30:20,866 --> 00:30:25,579
Well, uh, damn. I was...
just trying to be helpful.

322
00:30:25,663 --> 00:30:29,500
If you don't want my help,
I'll just sit over here and shut up.

323
00:30:29,583 --> 00:30:32,586
Pulling that out, it don't look like
you know what you're doing.

324
00:30:32,670 --> 00:30:35,880
Just shut up! OK?
Shut up. You don't know what I'm doing.

325
00:30:35,964 --> 00:30:38,425
- You don't know about the truck.
- Who you talking to?

326
00:30:38,509 --> 00:30:42,804
- Stop being a philosopher...
- Doggone second-generation immigrant,

327
00:30:42,888 --> 00:30:46,058
I bet I come over there
and hang my bad foot in your ass.

328
00:30:46,141 --> 00:30:47,851
(car horn)

329
00:30:57,195 --> 00:30:59,155
- Thanks.
- Anytime.

330
00:30:59,238 --> 00:31:01,782
- See you tomorrow?
- Yep. See ya.

331
00:31:02,909 --> 00:31:04,452
- Hey, kiddo.
- Hey.

332
00:31:04,535 --> 00:31:06,496
- How was it?
- All right.

333
00:31:07,497 --> 00:31:10,875
- (Nina) See ya, Einar.
- Got some groceries for dinner.

334
00:31:13,670 --> 00:31:15,338
OK.

335
00:31:18,174 --> 00:31:21,052
- Do you wanna take these inside, sweetie?
- Sure.

336
00:31:21,052 --> 00:31:22,429
- Got it?
- Yep.

337
00:31:23,721 --> 00:31:26,266
- Hey, Mitch.
- Hey, there.

338
00:31:30,186 --> 00:31:34,273
What happened here?
Why did you stop running cows?

339
00:31:35,608 --> 00:31:37,860
When Griffin died, I ran out of help.

340
00:31:40,447 --> 00:31:43,699
Then I got older, Mitch got mauled,

341
00:31:44,576 --> 00:31:47,746
and I sold the stock to stay on the place.

342
00:31:51,123 --> 00:31:53,626
Dinner will be ready in an hour.

343
00:31:55,962 --> 00:31:57,880
Come here, Sarah.

344
00:31:58,757 --> 00:32:01,051
Nope, stay here.

345
00:32:01,093 --> 00:32:03,345
- You finished?
- Yeah.

346
00:32:04,095 --> 00:32:07,474
Tell your kid to come down
out of that tree.

347
00:32:09,726 --> 00:32:12,354
(Griff) Come on, Charlie.

348
00:32:12,438 --> 00:32:14,898
Come on.
Don't be a fraidy-cat.

349
00:32:14,981 --> 00:32:16,900
(plate smashes)

350
00:32:23,449 --> 00:32:25,242
Oh, Jesus.

351
00:32:27,077 --> 00:32:28,954
I'm sorry.

352
00:32:29,037 --> 00:32:32,708
You're sorry, huh?
Well, that's just fine, then.

353
00:32:33,500 --> 00:32:37,463
- I'll buy you a new one.
- Oh. Just that easy?

354
00:32:39,047 --> 00:32:43,719
Maybe I liked that plate. In fact, maybe
that was my favorite goddamn plate!

355
00:32:43,802 --> 00:32:45,804
- It's just a plate.
- That's it, huh?

356
00:32:45,846 --> 00:32:49,308
Did it ever occur to you
that not everything can be replaced?

357
00:32:56,440 --> 00:32:58,817
Come down out of that tree!

358
00:33:05,699 --> 00:33:10,079
- You want this on the table?
- No, over here. Thank you.

359
00:33:13,041 --> 00:33:15,376
I'm so glad you're back, Jean.

360
00:33:24,052 --> 00:33:26,262
What happened to Nellie?

361
00:33:28,472 --> 00:33:30,558
Nellie left.

362
00:33:30,641 --> 00:33:33,603
About a year after we buried Griffin.

363
00:33:34,813 --> 00:33:37,690
Einar just never got a handle on it.

364
00:33:37,773 --> 00:33:41,444
And then, when he hardly
even noticed Nellie anymore, why...

365
00:33:41,527 --> 00:33:44,489
She found another man.
Who wouldn't?

366
00:33:45,657 --> 00:33:47,992
Think they live in Colorado.

367
00:33:49,411 --> 00:33:53,414
Do you think he blames me
for losing his wife too?

368
00:33:53,498 --> 00:33:55,375
I imagine he does.

369
00:34:05,342 --> 00:34:07,846
I don't want to stay here.

370
00:34:10,139 --> 00:34:12,058
What's wrong with him?

371
00:34:12,766 --> 00:34:14,853
Well, it's not you.

372
00:34:15,770 --> 00:34:17,980
He just never got over it.

373
00:34:19,608 --> 00:34:23,737
He really loved your dad.
You should know that.

374
00:34:23,820 --> 00:34:26,115
- Did you?
- Of course.

375
00:34:28,617 --> 00:34:31,036
You do have a plan, though, right?

376
00:34:31,119 --> 00:34:33,789
I mean, we don't have to stay here forever?

377
00:34:33,831 --> 00:34:36,041
Sure, I do.

378
00:34:36,083 --> 00:34:39,920
Soon as I earn enough money,
I'm gonna get us right out of here.

379
00:34:40,003 --> 00:34:43,215
You know what?
What do you think about...

380
00:34:43,257 --> 00:34:45,175
Butt, Montana?

381
00:34:49,805 --> 00:34:53,308
Come on, let's play.
You don't know how to read anymore?

382
00:34:56,186 --> 00:34:57,813
Where'd the bottle come from?

383
00:34:59,064 --> 00:35:00,941
The granary.

384
00:35:01,025 --> 00:35:04,444
It's been there for a while.
Sometimes I just like to look at it.

385
00:35:04,528 --> 00:35:06,447
15, two.

386
00:35:06,530 --> 00:35:08,824
You gonna open it?

387
00:35:08,866 --> 00:35:11,118
I'm not sure yet. 25.

388
00:35:11,201 --> 00:35:13,746
31 for two. Go.

389
00:35:14,955 --> 00:35:17,374
- Did you check on the bear?
- Eight.

390
00:35:17,416 --> 00:35:20,085
Yeah, you asked me to, didn't you?

391
00:35:20,835 --> 00:35:22,712
Here's a pair for two.

392
00:35:23,547 --> 00:35:25,632
I want you to feed him.

393
00:35:26,634 --> 00:35:28,678
- What?
- I want you to feed the bear.

394
00:35:28,762 --> 00:35:32,140
I don't trust Angie to feed
anything much past herself.

395
00:35:32,223 --> 00:35:36,102
"Feed the bear." "Please feed the bear."
"Bear, do you like bear shoes?"

396
00:35:36,186 --> 00:35:40,690
"What kind of food do you like, Bear?
Steak, chicken?"

397
00:35:40,773 --> 00:35:42,692
- Einar.
- What?

398
00:35:43,651 --> 00:35:45,778
Is her being here gonna ruin you?

399
00:35:48,114 --> 00:35:51,284
- The woman killed my son.
- Oh, come on.

400
00:35:51,367 --> 00:35:55,579
It was a car accident. They call them
accidents because it's nobody's fault.

401
00:35:55,663 --> 00:35:59,876
No, they call them accidents
to make the guilty feel better.

402
00:35:59,959 --> 00:36:03,254
- Is that so?
- I don't give a damn what they call them.

403
00:36:03,296 --> 00:36:05,215
My son's dead.

404
00:36:06,382 --> 00:36:08,301
Your granddaughter's not.

405
00:36:08,384 --> 00:36:10,302
And neither were you.

406
00:36:11,262 --> 00:36:15,558
Have you thought about
how she's gonna remember you?

407
00:36:16,393 --> 00:36:21,815
You know, come to think of it,
I don't feel like playing cards tonight.

408
00:36:21,856 --> 00:36:25,443
Put that bottle someplace
where I don't have to look at it.

409
00:37:21,875 --> 00:37:25,045
You know anything about pickup trucks?

410
00:37:27,089 --> 00:37:28,590
Aw, shit.

411
00:37:28,674 --> 00:37:33,094
Hand me that half-inch
socket wrench, would you?

412
00:37:33,136 --> 00:37:35,639
No, no, no.
Shiny one on the top.

413
00:37:36,431 --> 00:37:38,016
Yep.

414
00:37:39,184 --> 00:37:41,687
Do you wanna see what I'm doing?

415
00:37:45,857 --> 00:37:47,776
That's it.

416
00:37:49,528 --> 00:37:51,697
- OK, see these screws here?
- Mm-hm.

417
00:37:51,740 --> 00:37:56,494
This one I'm tightening, this holds
this thing up which holds the pan up.

418
00:37:56,577 --> 00:38:00,248
If this thing comes loose when you're
driving, you'll be sitting on the road.

419
00:38:00,331 --> 00:38:03,084
And that's not what you want to be doing...

420
00:38:03,126 --> 00:38:05,211
How come you and Einar don't get along?

421
00:38:05,295 --> 00:38:07,713
You're practically his daughter.

422
00:38:07,797 --> 00:38:10,258
What I am is his dead son's wife.

423
00:38:11,926 --> 00:38:16,306
He's always been really good to me.
He's the first friend I met here.

424
00:38:18,057 --> 00:38:20,810
I am not in the mood for their crap.

425
00:38:21,853 --> 00:38:23,021
I'll take 'em.

426
00:38:24,898 --> 00:38:28,943
- The special today is the enchilada plate.
- Thank you.

427
00:38:29,027 --> 00:38:32,822
They're good enchiladas.
Served by good people.

428
00:38:33,697 --> 00:38:35,616
I'm a good person.

429
00:38:36,576 --> 00:38:41,247
I'm also a woman who's taken more
than her fair share of shit off men.

430
00:38:41,330 --> 00:38:43,291
Don't push me.

431
00:38:43,374 --> 00:38:47,462
I mean, I couldn't even take a pinch of crap
from two little cheesedicks like you.

432
00:38:47,545 --> 00:38:51,215
- (Einar) OK, crank it.
- (engine fails to start)

433
00:38:51,257 --> 00:38:53,176
Again.

434
00:38:54,176 --> 00:38:55,511
Again.

435
00:38:55,594 --> 00:38:57,805
(engine starts)

436
00:39:00,559 --> 00:39:02,477
(engine revs)

437
00:39:04,313 --> 00:39:06,440
Take your foot off the gas.

438
00:39:07,441 --> 00:39:09,568
Take your foot off the gas!

439
00:39:16,074 --> 00:39:18,244
Is that for lunch?

440
00:39:18,327 --> 00:39:20,621
It's for a bear.

441
00:39:20,704 --> 00:39:24,041
Who the hell knows
what a bear eats anyway?

442
00:39:37,888 --> 00:39:39,973
Did I ask you to do that?

443
00:39:40,974 --> 00:39:42,976
Don't bears like honey?

444
00:39:43,018 --> 00:39:45,103
Winnie the Pooh does.

445
00:40:02,078 --> 00:40:03,913
- Oh, hey.
- Thought you were sick.

446
00:40:03,997 --> 00:40:06,416
Haven't seen you for a few days.

447
00:40:06,458 --> 00:40:11,715
It's only a two-restaurant town, so I try
to spread the county's money around.

448
00:40:12,590 --> 00:40:15,885
Meatloaf. Can I have onion rings
instead of mashed potatoes?

449
00:40:15,927 --> 00:40:18,679
Onion... Sure, I'll ask.

450
00:40:21,807 --> 00:40:24,059
Could you give me a ride home after work?

451
00:40:25,186 --> 00:40:26,604
Sure.

452
00:40:27,771 --> 00:40:29,357
(growls)

453
00:40:30,275 --> 00:40:32,485
(Griff) He looks like he's dancing.

454
00:40:32,568 --> 00:40:35,363
Well, maybe just happy to see
a girl with a sack of meat.

455
00:40:35,447 --> 00:40:38,824
I'll give you some here.
Why don't you toss this in?

456
00:40:51,295 --> 00:40:55,007
- He likes the honey.
- I think he does.

457
00:40:55,091 --> 00:40:59,178
Is that really the bear
that hurt Mr. Bradley?

458
00:40:59,219 --> 00:41:01,431
He's the one.

459
00:41:17,697 --> 00:41:19,700
(Jean) I don't wanna go right home.

460
00:41:19,742 --> 00:41:22,077
- Not just yet.
- You don't?

461
00:41:22,160 --> 00:41:24,538
Can't we just drive a little?

462
00:41:35,257 --> 00:41:38,302
Here's the thing.
I'm gonna be here about three more weeks.

463
00:41:38,385 --> 00:41:40,971
I'm afraid I'm not gonna get through it.

464
00:41:43,474 --> 00:41:45,476
Three weeks, huh?

465
00:41:48,061 --> 00:41:50,605
I don't wanna be in love, Crane.

466
00:42:00,949 --> 00:42:02,951
(moaning)

467
00:42:15,630 --> 00:42:17,299
Don't start without me.

468
00:42:20,552 --> 00:42:23,555
- (Einar) What's that?
- A flower.

469
00:42:23,596 --> 00:42:25,598
That's not a flower - it's a weed.

470
00:42:28,394 --> 00:42:30,396
It's pretty, though.

471
00:42:30,479 --> 00:42:35,068
- Don't you think it's pretty?
- Yeah, I think it's lovely.

472
00:42:35,110 --> 00:42:37,528
You want to wait a little longer
for your mother?

473
00:42:37,612 --> 00:42:39,989
- Just a little bit.
- OK.

474
00:42:45,536 --> 00:42:48,039
I had a music teacher
who was a lesbian.

475
00:42:55,505 --> 00:42:57,715
You guys are gay, right?

476
00:42:57,798 --> 00:42:59,675
(coughs)

477
00:43:03,596 --> 00:43:07,433
I'd think after 40 years of working together,
one of us would notice, don't you?

478
00:43:07,516 --> 00:43:11,813
Well, Einar, I always thought
you had really lovely hands.

479
00:43:11,896 --> 00:43:14,774
- You did? You never told me that.
- (Mitch laughs)

480
00:43:14,857 --> 00:43:18,360
I mean, it's cool.
Everybody needs love.

481
00:43:18,444 --> 00:43:20,696
You got that part right, little girl.

482
00:43:21,781 --> 00:43:23,991
(Einar) Jeez, what's next?

483
00:43:24,701 --> 00:43:26,494
Hey!

484
00:43:28,413 --> 00:43:32,083
- Hey, yourself. How you doing?
- Good. How are you?

485
00:43:32,166 --> 00:43:35,795
Good. There's somebody
I want you to meet.

486
00:43:37,046 --> 00:43:39,842
Griff, this is Sheriff Curtis.

487
00:43:39,925 --> 00:43:41,969
Nice to meet you, Griff.

488
00:43:43,428 --> 00:43:46,389
- Are you hungry?
- There isn't enough.

489
00:43:46,473 --> 00:43:50,686
I gotta swing back
through town anyway. So I'll see ya.

490
00:43:50,769 --> 00:43:54,439
- Thanks for the ride home.
- Take care of yourself, Crane.

491
00:43:56,025 --> 00:43:57,985
- I don't like him.
- I don't remember asking.

492
00:43:58,068 --> 00:44:00,070
I don't remember you ever asking me.

493
00:44:00,153 --> 00:44:02,906
Hey, I don't need your permission.

494
00:44:06,326 --> 00:44:09,329
You confused about how
to treat a guest in my house?

495
00:44:09,371 --> 00:44:11,373
It's just some guy my mom brought home.

496
00:44:11,456 --> 00:44:15,168
I expect you to be pleasant
to whoever comes to my door.

497
00:44:20,007 --> 00:44:21,257
Yes, sir.

498
00:44:21,341 --> 00:44:24,719
Unless it's some guy
looking to sell his angle on God.

499
00:44:24,803 --> 00:44:27,889
There's no excuse for that bullshit.

500
00:44:30,809 --> 00:44:36,648
Well, all right, then. Let's give a try
at these good-looking sandwiches.

501
00:45:01,132 --> 00:45:03,634
There you go.
Hold it right about here.

502
00:45:03,717 --> 00:45:04,844
OK.

503
00:45:04,927 --> 00:45:09,641
- His foot's not gonna go anywhere.
- Oh, yes, it is. Look at that calf run.

504
00:45:09,682 --> 00:45:11,517
He's off and gone.

505
00:45:13,311 --> 00:45:16,355
(Einar) Oops. That's a little bit low.

506
00:45:20,234 --> 00:45:22,820
- Yeah!
- I got it!

507
00:45:24,239 --> 00:45:26,782
- (Griff) Look at that!
- Oh, yeah.

508
00:45:26,782 --> 00:45:30,286
Go on, try it again.
There you go.

509
00:45:34,873 --> 00:45:38,335
You got any more improvements
you wanna make around here?

510
00:45:38,419 --> 00:45:40,462
I thought I'd
straighten some of this mess.

511
00:45:40,504 --> 00:45:42,757
Thought Mitch might
want to work on something.

512
00:45:42,840 --> 00:45:46,594
- Did you ask him about it?
- (Mitch) Well, of course she did.

513
00:45:47,553 --> 00:45:50,514
Now that we've got interesting
company around here, I...

514
00:45:50,598 --> 00:45:52,641
I feel inspired.

515
00:45:55,185 --> 00:45:57,605
Excuse me.
I gotta go to work.

516
00:46:10,536 --> 00:46:12,496
You wanna know
what I dreamed last night?

517
00:46:12,579 --> 00:46:14,623
What?

518
00:46:14,623 --> 00:46:18,752
I dreamed you weren't
such a miserable son of a bitch.

519
00:46:19,545 --> 00:46:23,423
That's not dreaming.
That's wishful thinking.

520
00:46:24,299 --> 00:46:28,136
Did you hear anything
unusual last night?

521
00:46:28,219 --> 00:46:32,057
Yeah. Somebody poking around
down by the river.

522
00:46:33,391 --> 00:46:35,476
I found some footprints.

523
00:46:36,770 --> 00:46:38,522
This.

524
00:46:45,987 --> 00:46:48,031
I sure do miss smoking.

525
00:46:48,991 --> 00:46:50,867
So do I.

526
00:46:59,167 --> 00:47:00,210
Hey.

527
00:47:01,210 --> 00:47:04,130
Hey! What are you doing here?

528
00:47:04,214 --> 00:47:07,551
- We're going to Angie's zoo.
- Really?

529
00:47:07,635 --> 00:47:09,679
What kind of pies you got today, Nina?

530
00:47:09,762 --> 00:47:13,391
Hey! I got three kinds of berry
and chocolate pecan.

531
00:47:13,474 --> 00:47:16,352
Guaranteed to make your teeth ache.

532
00:47:16,436 --> 00:47:19,898
Chocolate pecan, please.
With ice cream.

533
00:47:19,939 --> 00:47:23,067
Two chocolate pecan, one with ice cream.
Kid's got young teeth.

534
00:47:23,108 --> 00:47:25,027
Coming right up.

535
00:47:28,030 --> 00:47:29,907
Be right back.

536
00:47:29,991 --> 00:47:31,784
Crane.

537
00:47:33,661 --> 00:47:35,955
Einar.

538
00:47:38,082 --> 00:47:40,460
She capture your interest?

539
00:47:41,293 --> 00:47:44,255
Have you thought about the girl?
They're a set.

540
00:47:44,338 --> 00:47:46,549
Can I get you anything else, Crane?

541
00:47:46,632 --> 00:47:48,592
No. Just the check.

542
00:47:49,677 --> 00:47:51,387
OK.

543
00:47:56,100 --> 00:48:00,813
How does the law stand on shooting
somebody on your property?

544
00:48:01,689 --> 00:48:06,194
Well, if you didn't want to go to prison,
they'd have to be in your house.

545
00:48:06,277 --> 00:48:09,614
- That's what I thought.
- You think you got a problem?

546
00:48:09,697 --> 00:48:11,866
I'll let you know.

547
00:48:15,745 --> 00:48:17,163
Hey.

548
00:48:17,246 --> 00:48:19,499
You wanna hand me that rasp?

549
00:48:22,753 --> 00:48:25,422
No, those are pliers.
The rasp, next to...

550
00:48:26,798 --> 00:48:28,884
- This?
- That's it. Yep.

551
00:48:29,802 --> 00:48:32,054
Are there really cowgirls?

552
00:48:34,472 --> 00:48:36,891
Haven't you ever ridden a horse before?

553
00:48:36,975 --> 00:48:41,438
No. There weren't any horses
around Gary's apartment.

554
00:48:43,273 --> 00:48:45,817
He was my mom's boyfriend.

555
00:48:45,859 --> 00:48:48,362
We lived with him for two years.

556
00:48:50,322 --> 00:48:52,991
My mom had another boyfriend
before Gary.

557
00:48:53,033 --> 00:48:56,703
His name was Hank.
He didn't have any horses either.

558
00:48:57,704 --> 00:49:00,165
Hank didn't hit my mom like Gary did.

559
00:49:00,248 --> 00:49:02,542
He was just mean with his words.

560
00:49:02,625 --> 00:49:04,502
Like you.

561
00:49:09,049 --> 00:49:14,888
I can see where not learning to ride a horse
would be a disadvantage for a cowgirl.

562
00:49:14,971 --> 00:49:16,765
- You wanna try?
- Yeah.

563
00:49:16,848 --> 00:49:18,933
Here, grab that blanket.

564
00:49:36,077 --> 00:49:37,871
(Griff) What's that?

565
00:49:40,373 --> 00:49:42,708
Wanna have a look?

566
00:49:50,132 --> 00:49:52,217
Good afternoon, boy.

567
00:49:56,472 --> 00:49:59,391
Your father was sure first-rate.

568
00:49:59,475 --> 00:50:01,561
I miss him.

569
00:50:02,478 --> 00:50:04,605
I wish I missed him.
