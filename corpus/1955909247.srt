00:28:24,354 --> 00:28:25,486
Let me see you.

193
00:28:25,529 --> 00:28:26,879
You okay?

194
00:28:26,922 --> 00:28:28,358
Yeah?

195
00:28:28,402 --> 00:28:30,012
Look at you.

196
00:28:30,056 --> 00:28:31,274
You're okay.

197
00:28:31,318 --> 00:28:33,015
My princess.

198
00:28:34,843 --> 00:28:36,062
That's my girl.

199
00:28:36,105 --> 00:28:37,716
I'm sorry.

200
00:28:40,719 --> 00:28:42,764
ERIC:
I got ya.

201
00:28:42,808 --> 00:28:44,331
Come on, baby.

202
00:32:21,548 --> 00:32:23,637
STEPHANIE:
Paul?

203
00:32:30,339 --> 00:32:33,342
How are you gonna find
your way home?

204
00:32:53,014 --> 00:32:54,189
JANE:
Stephanie.

205
00:32:54,233 --> 00:32:55,451
ERIC:
Sweetheart! Stephanie!

206
00:32:55,495 --> 00:32:57,149
- JANE: Steph!
- ERIC: Stephanie!

207
00:33:00,804 --> 00:33:02,110
JANE:
Stephanie!

208
00:33:02,154 --> 00:33:03,677
ERIC:
Steph!

209
00:33:07,202 --> 00:33:11,032
Stephanie! You are not to leave
our sight, young lady!

210
00:33:11,076 --> 00:33:12,164
Don't.

211
00:33:12,207 --> 00:33:13,992
- She needs to listen.
- I said, don't.

212
00:33:15,950 --> 00:33:17,908
ERIC:
Stay calm.

213
00:33:17,952 --> 00:33:19,693
Both of you.

214
00:33:19,736 --> 00:33:23,262
Baby, it's really dangerous
for you to be out there, okay?

215
00:33:24,741 --> 00:33:28,049
STEPHANIE:
Why did you take Paul away?

216
00:33:28,093 --> 00:33:30,573
I want him to come home.

217
00:33:52,769 --> 00:33:55,207
[ERIC AND JANE
TALKING INDISTINCTLY]

218
00:34:03,650 --> 00:34:05,347
Hi, princess.

219
00:34:05,391 --> 00:34:06,566
Hi, Daddy.

220
00:34:08,046 --> 00:34:10,831
- I'm gonna make us breakfast.
- Okay.

221
00:34:12,398 --> 00:34:13,790
JANE:
Did you sleep well?

222
00:34:13,834 --> 00:34:15,227
STEPHANIE:
Mm-hmm.

223
00:34:17,185 --> 00:34:18,621
STEPHANIE:
The lights are back on.

224
00:34:18,665 --> 00:34:20,232
Yeah. Your, um,

225
00:34:20,275 --> 00:34:22,321
your father messed
with the breaker.

226
00:34:22,364 --> 00:34:23,757
More?

227
00:34:23,800 --> 00:34:25,063
Mm-hmm.

228
00:34:26,412 --> 00:34:28,718
What's he building?

229
00:34:28,762 --> 00:34:30,155
JANE:
Oh, you know your dad.

230
00:34:30,198 --> 00:34:32,983
He would rebuild
the Panama Canal if he could.

231
00:34:36,857 --> 00:34:38,685
STEPHANIE:
Why did you leave me?

232
00:34:47,346 --> 00:34:49,304
Stephanie,
you have to understand

233
00:34:49,348 --> 00:34:50,653
that your dad and me,

234
00:34:50,697 --> 00:34:54,701
we never would have left you
here alone if...

235
00:34:54,744 --> 00:34:56,137
We thought that...

236
00:34:56,181 --> 00:34:58,705
You thought
that the monster got me, too.

237
00:35:02,491 --> 00:35:03,884
Yeah.

238
00:35:03,927 --> 00:35:06,278
It still comes
sniffing around.

239
00:35:06,321 --> 00:35:09,194
It's in the woods.

240
00:35:09,237 --> 00:35:10,934
But if we get upset,

241
00:35:10,978 --> 00:35:12,806
it comes into the house.

242
00:35:12,849 --> 00:35:15,417
What do you do then,
when it comes in the house?

243
00:35:15,461 --> 00:35:17,115
We get totally quiet.

244
00:35:17,158 --> 00:35:20,292
Me and Francis are aces
at hiding from it.

245
00:35:21,641 --> 00:35:22,946
Aces.

246
00:35:22,990 --> 00:35:24,165
Mm-hmm.

247
00:35:25,775 --> 00:35:28,126
Steph, you're one tough kid,
you know that?

248
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,563
Not really.

249
00:35:32,739 --> 00:35:35,133
Really, I'm pretty scared.

250
00:36:01,681 --> 00:36:03,161
ERIC:
What do you think?

251
00:36:03,204 --> 00:36:05,511
For the monster?

252
00:36:05,554 --> 00:36:06,860
Yes.

253
00:36:08,470 --> 00:36:11,299
Do you think it's strong
enough to keep it out?

254
00:36:16,391 --> 00:36:18,132
Well,

255
00:36:18,176 --> 00:36:19,786
it's pretty good anyway.

256
00:36:21,483 --> 00:36:22,615
Thanks.

257
00:36:22,658 --> 00:36:24,399
I think so, too.

258
00:36:24,443 --> 00:36:26,358
I like it
when you build stuff.

259
00:36:26,401 --> 00:36:27,837
ERIC:
Is that so?

260
00:36:27,881 --> 00:36:29,361
Mm-hmm.

261
00:36:33,408 --> 00:36:34,670
Can I ask you a question?

262
00:36:34,714 --> 00:36:36,455
Sure.

263
00:36:36,498 --> 00:36:39,284
What happened to Mr. Hopper?

264
00:36:40,589 --> 00:36:43,288
Well, he...

265
00:36:43,331 --> 00:36:44,506
JANE:
Honey!

266
00:36:44,550 --> 00:36:46,552
Can you come inside
for a minute?

267
00:36:46,595 --> 00:36:48,249
ERIC:
Yeah.

268
00:36:50,425 --> 00:36:51,948
You stay here.

269
00:36:51,992 --> 00:36:54,299
Clear.

270
00:36:54,342 --> 00:36:55,430
Clear?

271
00:36:55,474 --> 00:36:57,563
Crystal.

272
00:37:02,089 --> 00:37:03,177
You stay here.

273
00:37:03,221 --> 00:37:05,310
Clear?

274
00:37:05,353 --> 00:37:08,313
Clear? Okay.

275
00:37:18,932 --> 00:37:21,543
JANE: So what's Atlanta saying
about the new protocols?

276
00:37:21,587 --> 00:37:23,980
WOMAN: The CDC
has no comment at this time.

277
00:37:24,024 --> 00:37:26,026
You've seen the news.

278
00:37:26,069 --> 00:37:28,289
The president...
is weighing all options.

279
00:37:28,333 --> 00:37:30,770
JANE: There are rumors online
that they've had some success

280
00:37:30,813 --> 00:37:33,033
at the containment facility
in Mumbai.

281
00:37:33,076 --> 00:37:35,731
WOMAN:
Yeah, rumors but...

282
00:37:35,775 --> 00:37:37,733
what's going on?

283
00:37:39,344 --> 00:37:40,867
Jane, I've never seen you
like this.

284
00:37:40,910 --> 00:37:43,391
Are Paul and Stephanie okay?

285
00:37:51,094 --> 00:37:53,140
It's cool.
It's impossible not to worry

286
00:37:53,183 --> 00:37:55,838
about all of our kids.

287
00:37:55,882 --> 00:37:59,494
Look, can you talk me through
the isolation protocol?

288
00:38:00,756 --> 00:38:02,671
ERIC:
Three!

289
00:38:02,715 --> 00:38:05,108
Two! One! Popcorn!

290
00:38:05,152 --> 00:38:07,589
ERIC:
Done! Bam!

291
00:38:07,633 --> 00:38:09,330
Eh-eh-eh!
Eh-eh-eh.

292
00:38:09,374 --> 00:38:12,159
Hot, hot, hot, hot, hot.

293
00:38:12,202 --> 00:38:13,116
Ah, shit.

294
00:38:13,160 --> 00:38:14,509
- Dad!
- ERIC: Oh! Sorry.

295
00:38:14,553 --> 00:38:15,989
I'm sorry, I didn't mean that.

296
00:38:18,644 --> 00:38:20,776
Fantastic.

297
00:38:20,820 --> 00:38:22,212
Salt!

298
00:38:22,256 --> 00:38:23,562
Good. Taste.

299
00:38:25,999 --> 00:38:27,348
STEPHANIE: Good.

300
00:38:27,392 --> 00:38:28,697
Give me some love.

301
00:38:31,439 --> 00:38:34,790
You almost done
with that fence?

302
00:38:34,834 --> 00:38:36,662
Probably tomorrow.

303
00:38:37,663 --> 00:38:38,751
Good.

304
00:38:41,928 --> 00:38:44,626
Ah, so they tell me.

305
00:38:45,758 --> 00:38:47,760
JANE:
Steph, what's Francis doing?

306
00:38:47,803 --> 00:38:49,196
Dancing.

307
00:38:49,239 --> 00:38:51,503
Oh baby, turtles can't dance.

308
00:38:52,504 --> 00:38:53,940
Don't listen to her, Francis.

309
00:38:53,983 --> 00:38:56,203
Show her your special dance.

310
00:38:56,246 --> 00:38:57,683
His special... Oh!

311
00:38:57,726 --> 00:38:59,249
ERIC:
Oh!

312
00:38:59,293 --> 00:39:01,643
That is not a special dance!

313
00:39:01,687 --> 00:39:03,297
That is tickle!

314
00:39:03,341 --> 00:39:04,342
Oh, Francis,

315
00:39:04,385 --> 00:39:05,691
you're Fran-tastic.

316
00:39:05,734 --> 00:39:06,779
I don't get it.

317
00:39:06,822 --> 00:39:08,607
I do!

318
00:39:08,650 --> 00:39:10,522
ERIC:
I don't get it.

319
00:39:10,565 --> 00:39:14,613
- Francis is Fran-tastic.
- Francis into fantastic.

320
00:39:14,656 --> 00:39:16,528
ERIC:
But the word is fantastic.

321
00:39:17,964 --> 00:39:19,661
ERIC:
Fantastic. It's not Fran-tastic.

322
00:39:19,705 --> 00:39:21,489
JANE:
It's Fran-tastic.

323
00:39:37,200 --> 00:39:38,767
Be right back.

324
00:39:38,811 --> 00:39:40,203
Okay.

325
00:40:05,315 --> 00:40:08,623
JANE:
Why, baby. Why?

326
00:40:08,667 --> 00:40:10,886
ERIC:
It's okay, it's okay.

327
00:40:10,930 --> 00:40:12,801
Shh, shh, shh, shh.

328
00:40:12,845 --> 00:40:15,587
I know.
Take your time.

329
00:40:16,892 --> 00:40:19,025
ERIC: Shh, shh, shh, shh.
I got you.

330
00:40:19,068 --> 00:40:21,767
I got you.

331
00:40:23,595 --> 00:40:25,248
Come on. Come on.

332
00:40:45,530 --> 00:40:47,227
How did Paul come back?

333
00:40:55,409 --> 00:40:57,542
Did the monster bring him?

334
00:40:57,585 --> 00:40:59,587
Yes.

335
00:40:59,631 --> 00:41:00,893
STEPHANIE:
Why?

336
00:41:02,590 --> 00:41:05,550
We don't really know why it does
any of the things it does.

337
00:41:08,248 --> 00:41:09,945
Maybe we should leave.

338
00:41:13,209 --> 00:41:16,125
I think it would just
come after us, princess.

339
00:41:16,169 --> 00:41:17,997
After me?

340
00:41:18,040 --> 00:41:20,129
Yes.

341
00:41:22,915 --> 00:41:25,221
It wants me, right?

342
00:41:25,265 --> 00:41:28,311
That's why
it keeps coming back.

343
00:41:30,575 --> 00:41:32,490
ERIC:
Yes.

344
00:41:34,579 --> 00:41:37,756
You used to say there's
no such thing as monsters.

345
00:41:37,799 --> 00:41:39,671
I know.

346
00:41:41,977 --> 00:41:43,936
I'm sorry.

347
00:41:48,288 --> 00:41:49,855
I was wrong.

348
00:41:53,293 --> 00:41:54,860
May I be excused?

349
00:44:31,669 --> 00:44:32,887
Hey, princess.

350
00:44:32,931 --> 00:44:34,367
Hey, Dad.

351
00:44:36,848 --> 00:44:38,676
Can we talk?

352
00:44:40,808 --> 00:44:43,724
Your mother's sorry
for losing her temper.

353
00:44:43,768 --> 00:44:46,596
- No big deal.
- Mmm, no, it is a big deal.

354
00:44:46,640 --> 00:44:48,337
All of us have to watch

355
00:44:48,381 --> 00:44:50,078
what we do, how we feel.

356
00:44:50,122 --> 00:44:52,298
You included.

357
00:44:52,341 --> 00:44:54,082
Because that will make
the monster come.

358
00:44:54,126 --> 00:44:56,258
ERIC: Mm-hmm.

359
00:44:56,302 --> 00:44:59,261
We didn't mean to upset you.

360
00:44:59,305 --> 00:45:01,046
And that's why
we didn't wake you up

361
00:45:01,089 --> 00:45:02,438
when we took Paul away.

362
00:45:02,482 --> 00:45:05,224
And maybe that was wrong,
I don't know.

363
00:45:05,267 --> 00:45:07,313
Parents aren't perfect.

364
00:45:07,356 --> 00:45:09,054
That's the sad truth.

365
00:45:12,927 --> 00:45:14,973
Why did you leave me here?

366
00:45:20,456 --> 00:45:23,851
We were afraid, how's that?

367
00:45:23,895 --> 00:45:25,070
I was afraid.

368
00:45:25,113 --> 00:45:27,333
Of what?

369
00:45:27,376 --> 00:45:28,726
Don't lie.

370
00:45:33,861 --> 00:45:36,211
I was afraid of myself, maybe?

371
00:45:36,255 --> 00:45:38,910
That I wouldn't be strong enough

372
00:45:38,953 --> 00:45:40,128
to take care of the things

373
00:45:40,172 --> 00:45:42,304
that I need to take care of.

374
00:45:42,348 --> 00:45:43,958
What do you need to do?

375
00:45:44,002 --> 00:45:45,264
Well, that's the scary part,

376
00:45:45,307 --> 00:45:47,701
I'm not quite sure.

377
00:45:47,745 --> 00:45:48,876
Can I help?

378
00:45:50,356 --> 00:45:52,401
Maybe, princess.

379
00:45:54,273 --> 00:45:57,015
You're strong, Stephanie.

380
00:45:57,058 --> 00:46:00,192
I'm talking about
strength up here.

381
00:46:00,235 --> 00:46:02,194
Strength on the inside.

382
00:46:02,237 --> 00:46:04,283
Your mommy and me,
we made you.

383
00:46:04,326 --> 00:46:06,720
We made your eyes that color

384
00:46:06,764 --> 00:46:09,636
and we made your hair
straight and blonde.

385
00:46:09,679 --> 00:46:10,811
That's what we did.

386
00:46:10,855 --> 00:46:13,553
We made everything out here.

387
00:46:13,596 --> 00:46:17,035
But up here, on the inside,
that's all you.

388
00:46:17,078 --> 00:46:18,210
All the way.

389
00:46:18,253 --> 00:46:19,559
The good and the bad,

390
00:46:19,602 --> 00:46:22,040
that's for you to control.

391
00:46:22,083 --> 00:46:23,563
That's for you to change,

392
00:46:23,606 --> 00:46:24,912
if you want to.

393
00:46:24,956 --> 00:46:28,611
The fear and the anger
and the doubt,

394
00:46:28,655 --> 00:46:31,005
they're what call the monster.

395
00:46:31,049 --> 00:46:33,616
And when you get those feelings,
the bad feelings,

396
00:46:33,660 --> 00:46:36,010
all you have to do
is make them small.

397
00:46:36,054 --> 00:46:37,838
That's how you beat it.

398
00:46:37,882 --> 00:46:39,666
That's the number one rule.

399
00:46:39,709 --> 00:46:41,276
Don't let
the bad things get big,

400
00:46:41,320 --> 00:46:43,061
everything will be fine.

401
00:46:43,104 --> 00:46:44,453
You get it?

402
00:46:44,497 --> 00:46:46,238
Mm-hmm.

403
00:46:48,675 --> 00:46:51,504
Now, I'm betting locked up
inside that head of yours,

404
00:46:51,547 --> 00:46:54,637
you have enough strength
to stop that monster cold.

405
00:47:03,908 --> 00:47:05,170
Dunk.

406
00:47:18,705 --> 00:47:20,098
You all right?

407
00:47:20,141 --> 00:47:21,664
STEPHANIE:
Mm-hmm.

408
00:47:39,421 --> 00:47:41,641
I love you, Daddy.

409
00:47:54,045 --> 00:47:56,177
ERIC: She's lived longer than any of them,
right?

410
00:47:56,221 --> 00:47:58,876
JANE: Yeah.

411
00:47:58,919 --> 00:48:00,921
JANE:
Do you really believe

412
00:48:00,965 --> 00:48:03,097
that she isn't gonna end up
like the rest of them?

413
00:48:03,141 --> 00:48:05,317
ERIC: I talked to her,
she can keep herself calm.

414
00:48:05,360 --> 00:48:07,362
- She's a tough kid.
- JANE: You talked to her.

415
00:48:07,406 --> 00:48:09,538
ERIC: Maybe it is,

416
00:48:09,582 --> 00:48:11,192
I don't know, we don't know.

417
00:48:11,236 --> 00:48:12,454
JANE:
We have to protect her.

418
00:48:12,498 --> 00:48:13,891
This procedure, I can do it,

419
00:48:13,934 --> 00:48:15,675
- I can keep her safe.
- ERIC: You're not

420
00:48:15,718 --> 00:48:17,459
that kind of doctor,
it's too dangerous,

421
00:48:17,503 --> 00:48:20,114
the procedure could kill her.

422
00:48:20,158 --> 00:48:22,725
ERIC: The best thing to do
right now is we just wait.

423
00:48:22,769 --> 00:48:24,336
That's all I'm asking you
to do is wait.

424
00:48:24,379 --> 00:48:26,164
JANE: Wait for what?
What if she can't?

425
00:48:26,207 --> 00:48:27,817
You've seen
what those things can do.

426
00:48:27,861 --> 00:48:30,342
ERIC: Yeah.
I've seen it, in my house.

427
00:49:15,865 --> 00:49:16,910
Mom?

428
00:49:16,954 --> 00:49:18,129
Dad?

429
00:50:12,835 --> 00:50:14,011
Mom?

430
00:50:14,054 --> 00:50:15,664
Dad?

431
00:50:37,643 --> 00:50:39,036
Daddy?

432
00:50:40,602 --> 00:50:41,734
Daddy!

433
00:50:41,777 --> 00:50:43,170
ERIC:
Hi, princess.

434
00:51:46,451 --> 00:51:48,235
Mom?

435
00:51:48,279 --> 00:51:49,584
Dad?

436
00:52:04,164 --> 00:52:05,470
No!

437
00:52:10,170 --> 00:52:12,912
JANE: Steph!

438
00:52:12,955 --> 00:52:15,480
ERIC: All right, take it easy,
she's fine, she's fine.

439
00:52:15,523 --> 00:52:18,700
Look at me,
you got to stay calm. Okay?

440
00:52:18,744 --> 00:52:19,701
The monster killed you.

441
00:52:19,745 --> 00:52:21,094
Nobody killed me.

442
00:52:21,138 --> 00:52:23,009
Listen to me, baby,
you got to stay calm.

443
00:52:23,052 --> 00:52:24,663
No, Daddy, the basement.

444
00:52:27,796 --> 00:52:29,146
Run!

445
00:52:31,104 --> 00:52:33,150
- Daddy! Dad!
- JANE: Shh! Shh, shh...

446
00:52:33,193 --> 00:52:34,934
STEPHANIE:
Daddy!

447
00:52:49,862 --> 00:52:51,211
JANE:
All right, it's okay.

448
00:52:51,255 --> 00:52:53,822
It's okay. It's okay.

449
00:52:53,866 --> 00:52:56,042
Shh! We have to be quiet.

450
00:52:56,085 --> 00:52:58,175
The monster might hear us.

451
00:53:41,914 --> 00:53:43,655
We did it.

452
00:54:17,950 --> 00:54:20,082
Come on, it's clear.

453
00:54:21,475 --> 00:54:23,347
Mom!

454
00:54:45,586 --> 00:54:47,458
Ow. Ow.

455
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:51,636
Francis.

456
00:55:00,035 --> 00:55:02,516
ERIC:
Stephanie! Wait!

457
00:55:10,132 --> 00:55:11,612
Stephanie!

458
00:55:26,235 --> 00:55:28,107
STEPHANIE:
The monster!

459
00:55:30,588 --> 00:55:31,545
The monster! The monster!

460
00:55:31,589 --> 00:55:33,808
JANE:
I'm sorry.

461
00:55:33,852 --> 00:55:35,375
I'm sorry, it's you.

462
00:55:35,419 --> 00:55:37,246
It's you.

463
00:55:41,599 --> 00:55:43,949
The monster is you.

464
00:56:33,955 --> 00:56:36,393
ERIC:
Baby, how'd you sleep?

465
00:56:36,436 --> 00:56:38,133
I had a weird dream.

466
00:56:38,177 --> 00:56:39,961
Oh, I'm sorry.

467
00:56:40,005 --> 00:56:42,486
ERIC: Your mom will be back

468
00:56:42,529 --> 00:56:44,488
in a little while, she had
a meeting at the hospital.

469
00:56:44,531 --> 00:56:47,316
STEPHANIE: Sure.

470
00:56:48,361 --> 00:56:49,623
Hey, Paul.

471
00:56:49,667 --> 00:56:52,060
PAUL:
Hey, Steph.

472
00:56:54,411 --> 00:56:56,325
STEPHANIE:
I don't wanna remember.

473
00:56:56,369 --> 00:56:58,589
I don't want to remember.

474
00:56:58,632 --> 00:57:00,286
It's okay.

475
00:57:00,329 --> 00:57:01,896
You're all right.

476
00:57:04,682 --> 00:57:05,813
STEPHANIE:
I'm sorry.

477
00:57:05,857 --> 00:57:07,293
You don't have to apologize.

478
00:57:07,336 --> 00:57:09,251
But what are you sorry for?

479
00:57:10,427 --> 00:57:12,733
I won't run away again.

480
00:57:12,777 --> 00:57:14,474
You're sick.

481
00:57:14,518 --> 00:57:16,433
You have something inside you.

482
00:57:16,476 --> 00:57:18,652
It's making you see things.

483
00:57:18,696 --> 00:57:21,612
It's making you do things.

484
00:57:21,655 --> 00:57:25,180
Part of what it's making you do
is hurting your memory.

485
00:57:25,224 --> 00:57:26,878
We think if you can remember,

486
00:57:26,921 --> 00:57:28,749
it'll help you fight it.

487
00:57:28,793 --> 00:57:30,838
Your mother and I
have been talking

488
00:57:30,882 --> 00:57:33,841
and there's something

489
00:57:33,885 --> 00:57:35,016
we'd like to try with you.

490
00:57:35,060 --> 00:57:36,148
Like an experiment.

491
00:57:36,191 --> 00:57:37,932
More like a game.

492
00:57:37,976 --> 00:57:40,979
ERIC: Mm-hmm.

493
00:57:42,110 --> 00:57:44,504
I need you
to close your eyes.

494
00:57:44,548 --> 00:57:46,288
Go on.

495
00:57:46,332 --> 00:57:49,248
ERIC:
I want you to listen to these clicks.

496
00:57:53,818 --> 00:57:56,995
Let your body relax.

497
00:57:57,038 --> 00:58:00,259
Good. Let your mind wander.

498
00:58:01,739 --> 00:58:03,131
That's it.

499
00:58:03,175 --> 00:58:06,526
Let it go.

500
00:58:06,570 --> 00:58:09,268
Tell me what happened
the day Paul died.

501
00:58:09,311 --> 00:58:11,009
Tell me what happened
that morning.

502
00:58:12,967 --> 00:58:14,534
We're carving pumpkins.

503
00:58:14,578 --> 00:58:15,753
That's right.

504
00:58:15,796 --> 00:58:18,320
That's, that's good, princess.

505
00:58:18,364 --> 00:58:20,105
He's being mean.

506
00:58:20,148 --> 00:58:21,410
Teasing me.

507
00:58:21,454 --> 00:58:24,326
I think he was just playing
with you.

508
00:58:24,370 --> 00:58:26,067
What happened next?

509
00:58:28,069 --> 00:58:29,723
Cut it out!

510
00:58:29,767 --> 00:58:31,725
- I got mad.
- ERIC: Sure, you did.

511
00:58:31,769 --> 00:58:33,161
Of course, you did.

512
00:58:33,205 --> 00:58:34,859
And that's okay.

513
00:58:34,902 --> 00:58:36,861
What happened after you got mad?

514
00:58:36,904 --> 00:58:38,297
I went for him.

515
00:58:41,822 --> 00:58:43,563
How?

516
00:58:43,607 --> 00:58:45,130
With my arms.

517
00:58:45,173 --> 00:58:48,350
All of them.

518
00:58:51,963 --> 00:58:53,442
What happened after that?

519
00:58:53,486 --> 00:58:55,619
STEPHANIE:
I hit Mommy.

520
00:58:55,662 --> 00:58:57,055
JANE:
Okay, stop. Stop.

521
00:58:57,098 --> 00:58:59,013
- Just stop.
- You ran!

522
00:59:01,973 --> 00:59:04,845
You left me.

523
00:59:04,889 --> 00:59:07,195
Okay, Eric, stop it, now!

524
00:59:07,239 --> 00:59:11,156
ERIC:
What happened next?

525
00:59:11,199 --> 00:59:12,766
ERIC:
Stephanie!

526
00:59:12,810 --> 00:59:14,028
Stephanie!

527
00:59:28,565 --> 00:59:31,306
STEPHANIE:
Yes. I'm Stephanie.

528
00:59:34,658 --> 00:59:36,398
I am Stephanie.

529
00:59:44,581 --> 00:59:46,539
You happy?

530
00:59:46,583 --> 00:59:48,410
You think she can control that?

531
00:59:48,454 --> 00:59:51,196
- ERIC: We do it your way.
- JANE: Thank you.

532
01:00:11,869 --> 01:00:14,959
ERIC:
That's still our little girl in there.

533
01:00:19,877 --> 01:00:21,313
Stephanie?

534
01:00:24,229 --> 01:00:26,057
Princess?

535
01:00:31,715 --> 01:00:33,499
What's next?

536
01:00:35,283 --> 01:00:36,981
If you take the razor,

537
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,811
and just...

538
01:00:40,854 --> 01:00:42,987
just shave
this section right here.

539
01:00:58,437 --> 01:01:00,308
JANE: Yeah.

540
01:01:06,750 --> 01:01:07,838
You okay?

541
01:01:07,881 --> 01:01:09,448
Yeah.

542
01:01:18,022 --> 01:01:19,937
Jesus Christ.

543
01:01:19,980 --> 01:01:21,416
Actually,
it's relatively simple.

544
01:01:21,460 --> 01:01:23,418
As soon as we get
through the bone,

545
01:01:23,462 --> 01:01:24,724
we feed the endoscope through.

546
01:01:24,768 --> 01:01:26,639
There's a natural pathway
for it to follow.

547
01:01:26,683 --> 01:01:28,597
If this doesn't work?

548
01:01:29,947 --> 01:01:31,644
It's going to work.

549
01:02:12,511 --> 01:02:15,775
FEMALE REPORTER:
Tragedy unfolding in Mumbai.

550
01:02:15,819 --> 01:02:17,995
We are now expecting
confirmation

551
01:02:18,038 --> 01:02:19,518
from the White House.

552
01:02:19,561 --> 01:02:22,347
There has been
an incident in the lab,

553
01:02:22,390 --> 01:02:24,305
where the rumored
surgical trials

554
01:02:24,349 --> 01:02:25,916
are being conducted.

555
01:02:25,959 --> 01:02:27,787
The death toll is unconfirmed,

556
01:02:27,831 --> 01:02:30,529
but there were at least
200 physicians

557
01:02:30,572 --> 01:02:32,139
and researchers gathered

558
01:02:32,183 --> 01:02:33,793
by the coalition of nations,

559
01:02:33,837 --> 01:02:35,926
at the facility.

560
01:02:35,969 --> 01:02:40,017
With all the therapeutic
containment efforts failing,

561
01:02:40,060 --> 01:02:42,715
this surgery was viewed,
by many researchers,

562
01:02:42,759 --> 01:02:46,371
as our last best hope
to finding a cure,

563
01:02:46,414 --> 01:02:48,765
a hope that is now fading.

564
01:02:48,808 --> 01:02:50,244
The nation and the world

565
01:02:50,288 --> 01:02:52,856
are reckoning
with what some fringe elements

566
01:02:52,899 --> 01:02:54,379
of the scientific community

567
01:02:54,422 --> 01:02:56,816
have been saying
since the initial outbreak

568
01:02:56,860 --> 01:02:58,035
in April,

569
01:02:58,078 --> 01:03:00,385
that euthanasia may be

570
01:03:00,428 --> 01:03:02,779
the only cure.

571
01:04:02,577 --> 01:04:04,014
JANE:
"Once upon a time,

572
01:04:04,057 --> 01:04:07,321
in a place
just beyond our sight,

573
01:04:07,365 --> 01:04:11,021
there lived a magical kingdom
called Anywhere.

574
01:04:11,064 --> 01:04:13,675
In Anywhere,
anything was possible."

575
01:05:55,864 --> 01:05:58,128
ERIC:
Hey, Steph.

576
01:05:58,171 --> 01:06:00,957
Do you wanna come for a walk
in the orchard with me?

577
01:06:03,481 --> 01:06:04,786
Come on.

578
01:06:06,353 --> 01:06:08,225
STEPHANIE:
Okay.

579
01:06:29,681 --> 01:06:32,075
ERIC:
I made you some hot chocolate.

580
01:06:42,302 --> 01:06:45,566
We haven't been out
to the orchard in a while.

581
01:06:45,610 --> 01:06:47,177
Mm-hmm.

582
01:06:49,744 --> 01:06:52,051
Do you think we can make
some orange juice?

583
01:06:52,095 --> 01:06:53,748
For all three of us?

584
01:06:53,792 --> 01:06:55,185
I don't see why not.

585
01:06:55,228 --> 01:06:57,013
STEPHANIE:
Okay.

586
01:07:25,911 --> 01:07:27,826
I did that.

587
01:07:27,869 --> 01:07:30,742
- No, baby.
- Yes, I did.

588
01:07:30,785 --> 01:07:33,223
But you don't remember doing it.

589
01:07:33,266 --> 01:07:35,660
Well, then it wasn't you.

590
01:07:35,703 --> 01:07:38,793
What's wrong with me?

591
01:07:38,837 --> 01:07:41,100
Imagine you're a door,

592
01:07:41,144 --> 01:07:42,232
and there's something

593
01:07:42,275 --> 01:07:43,885
that's trying
to come through.

594
01:07:43,929 --> 01:07:45,148
What is it?

595
01:07:45,191 --> 01:07:47,889
ERIC:
We don't know.

596
01:07:47,933 --> 01:07:50,109
Something we don't understand.

597
01:07:50,153 --> 01:07:51,719
Something,

598
01:07:51,763 --> 01:07:54,157
from another place.

599
01:07:54,200 --> 01:07:57,595
I don't even think
it has a body.

600
01:07:57,638 --> 01:07:58,857
That's why it uses yours.

601
01:07:58,900 --> 01:08:00,337
It changes you.

602
01:08:00,380 --> 01:08:02,382
And you're not alone,
there's kids like you

603
01:08:02,426 --> 01:08:03,949
all over the world.

604
01:08:03,992 --> 01:08:06,082
Can they stop it?

605
01:08:08,127 --> 01:08:10,738
There's one more thing
we're gonna try.

606
01:08:10,782 --> 01:08:11,913
I'm sorry.

607
01:08:11,957 --> 01:08:13,219
No, stop apologizing...

608
01:08:13,263 --> 01:08:15,439
- But I'm sorry.
- Don't be!

609
01:08:15,482 --> 01:08:18,529
Don't be sorry.

610
01:08:18,572 --> 01:08:19,921
You didn't do anything wrong.

611
01:08:19,965 --> 01:08:22,707
Not one day in your life.

612
01:08:22,750 --> 01:08:24,926
Do you understand me?

613
01:08:30,541 --> 01:08:32,978
I think it's getting cold.

614
01:08:33,021 --> 01:08:34,719
It's getting cold.

615
01:08:34,762 --> 01:08:36,199
We should drink up.

616
01:08:38,201 --> 01:08:39,332
Wait.

617
01:08:41,769 --> 01:08:44,163
Don't forget cheers, Dad.

618
01:08:45,643 --> 01:08:47,688
Cheers.

619
01:09:11,538 --> 01:09:14,802
STEPHANIE:
Dad, wait. I, I can stop it.

620
01:09:14,846 --> 01:09:17,979
Dad. No, don't.

621
01:09:23,507 --> 01:09:26,553
See? I can stay calm.

622
01:09:41,481 --> 01:09:44,180
I love you, Daddy.

623
01:09:44,223 --> 01:09:47,487
You are my baby girl.

624
01:09:47,531 --> 01:09:49,010
You're my princess.

625
01:09:51,665 --> 01:09:53,711
I love you so much.

626
01:10:09,205 --> 01:10:10,336
Stephanie...

627
01:10:12,382 --> 01:10:15,559
Steph

628
01:10:18,518 --> 01:10:21,608
You should've killed me
when you had the chance.

629
01:11:19,536 --> 01:11:22,234
Ah.

630
01:11:23,279 --> 01:11:25,890
Oh, what did I do?

631
01:11:29,633 --> 01:11:32,984
Oh, it's over,
I loved her. Oh.

632
01:12:23,817 --> 01:12:26,559
My God.

633
01:12:26,603 --> 01:12:27,691
- Upstairs.
- JANE: No, no!

634
01:12:27,734 --> 01:12:29,475
- ERIC: Go! Go upstairs.
- No, no!

635
01:12:29,519 --> 01:12:31,042
- Go!
- No!

636
01:12:47,624 --> 01:12:50,409
Princess... oh.

637
01:14:17,365 --> 01:14:19,933
Stop! St... Stop!

638
01:14:23,720 --> 01:14:25,417
You tried to kill me.

639
01:14:27,201 --> 01:14:28,812
You're not my daughter.

640
01:14:33,730 --> 01:14:34,992
What the hell are you?

641
01:14:36,341 --> 01:14:37,995
Big.

642
01:14:46,743 --> 01:14:49,049
Stay there. Clear?

643
01:14:50,442 --> 01:14:51,835
Good.

644
01:14:55,882 --> 01:14:59,059
No! I'm so... I'm sorry.
I'm so sorry. I'm sorry.

645
01:15:23,301 --> 01:15:24,998
We should have never left you.

646
01:15:26,043 --> 01:15:27,871
You shouldn't have come back.
