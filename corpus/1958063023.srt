Oh wonderful.

26
00:02:12,733 --> 00:02:14,244
The kids are just so
excited to show all the work

27
00:02:14,268 --> 00:02:17,238
they did with the gallery
for the center fundraiser

28
00:02:17,271 --> 00:02:19,673
especially your grandson Percy.

29
00:02:19,707 --> 00:02:23,344
He brought in an old shoebox
full of goodies for the wall.

30
00:02:23,377 --> 00:02:24,512
Oh did he?

31
00:02:24,545 --> 00:02:25,913
A shoebox you say?

32
00:02:25,946 --> 00:02:27,114
Yeah.

33
00:02:27,147 --> 00:02:28,616
He said he found it
in your basement.

34
00:02:28,649 --> 00:02:32,820
And, I must admit the photos
inside are truly amazing.

35
00:02:34,222 --> 00:02:38,158
My goodness it was like
going back in a time machine.

00:02:57,278 --> 00:02:58,278
Oh.

39
00:02:59,347 --> 00:03:02,015

I can hardly believe it myself.

49

I can't hold it a minute longer.

This is a story of
perseverance, of hope.

51
00:04:14,822 --> 00:04:17,157
(laughing)

52
00:04:17,190 --> 00:04:21,329
This is a story of two
boys trying to keep

53
00:04:21,362 --> 00:04:23,163
their black asses alive.

54
00:04:23,196 --> 00:04:25,433

55
00:04:27,568 --> 00:04:29,937

57
00:04:35,609 --> 00:04:38,412

[Dale] Hi, my
name's Dale Stevens.

60
00:04:51,459 --> 00:04:52,902
There ain't nothing
better in this world

61
00:04:52,926 --> 00:04:54,928
than a truck with diesel.

62
00:04:54,962 --> 00:04:57,230
(laughing)

63
00:05:02,870 --> 00:05:04,938
Jarvis, supper's ready.

64
00:05:06,474 --> 00:05:08,442
Mama, watch this.

65
00:05:08,476 --> 00:05:10,243
Jericho, do it again.

66
00:05:10,277 --> 00:05:14,382
Hi my name is Dale
Stevens, and boy do I have

67
00:05:14,415 --> 00:05:15,649
a deal for you.

68
00:05:16,817 --> 00:05:18,886
Come on down to Be the
Motorist and get one

69
00:05:18,919 --> 00:05:20,454
of our fine automobiles.

70
00:05:20,488 --> 00:05:22,590
(laughing)

71
00:05:22,623 --> 00:05:24,257
Jericho, that was real good.

72
00:05:24,291 --> 00:05:25,459
How'd you learn to do that?

73
00:05:25,493 --> 00:05:26,460
I don't know.

74
00:05:26,494 --> 00:05:27,928
(laughing)

75
00:05:27,961 --> 00:05:30,964
Mama, can Jericho
stay for dinner?

76
00:05:32,733 --> 00:05:34,301
I suppose so.

77
00:05:34,334 --> 00:05:35,769
Yes.

78
00:05:35,803 --> 00:05:38,806
Ma, look who's
staying for dinner.

79
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,142
Well I sure would
hate for company

80
00:05:42,175 --> 00:05:45,112
to get a beating, but that's
exactly what's gonna happen

81
00:05:45,145 --> 00:05:47,481
if y'all don't get in
there in that there table.

82
00:05:47,515 --> 00:05:50,818
Y'all go on and
get washed up now.

83
00:05:50,851 --> 00:05:51,919
Boys, mama.

84
00:05:56,256 --> 00:05:57,658
Sweetie.

85
00:05:57,691 --> 00:05:59,593
[Mama] Oh hey baby.

86
00:05:59,627 --> 00:06:00,994
Hey baby, what's for dinner?

87
00:06:01,028 --> 00:06:04,432
Cornbread, collard
greens, and black eyed peas.

88
00:06:04,465 --> 00:06:07,468
All right, fix
me a plate, please.

89
00:06:08,536 --> 00:06:10,003
Where's Junior?

90
00:06:10,037 --> 00:06:11,572
Oh he be home in a minute.

91
00:06:11,605 --> 00:06:13,173
He's over at Bobby's house.

92
00:06:13,206 --> 00:06:17,778
They've been studying for
that arithmetic exam all week.

93
00:06:17,811 --> 00:06:19,580
Oh Thomas, wouldn't
it be something

94
00:06:19,613 --> 00:06:23,183
to have another Negro
doctor in this world?

95
00:06:24,552 --> 00:06:28,456
Baby, the look on your
face, what's troubling you?

96
00:06:30,991 --> 00:06:33,427
No matter what I do it
ain't never good enough.

97
00:06:33,461 --> 00:06:35,195
Boss man, said I want
you to come in early,

98
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,129
pull a second shift.

99
00:06:36,163 --> 00:06:37,531
I say yes sir, no problem sir.

100
00:06:37,565 --> 00:06:39,767
Anything you need me to do, sir.

101
00:06:39,800 --> 00:06:41,969
You know they had
that job on that board

102
00:06:42,002 --> 00:06:43,437
for over two weeks.

103
00:06:43,471 --> 00:06:45,281
I would walk by it everyday
on my five minute break

104
00:06:45,305 --> 00:06:48,008
while all the white fellas
is sitting around slacking.

105
00:06:48,041 --> 00:06:49,719
Sometimes I just stop,
and I just look at it

106
00:06:49,743 --> 00:06:53,547
knowing I can do the job if
they'd just give me a chance.

107
00:06:53,581 --> 00:06:57,718
They know I can run that paper
machine better than anybody.

108
00:06:57,751 --> 00:07:00,488
But, Negroes ain't
eligible for promotion.

109
00:07:00,521 --> 00:07:03,857
So some white man is
paper press manager,

110
00:07:03,891 --> 00:07:05,626
been there three months.

111
00:07:05,659 --> 00:07:08,328
You oughta be
glad you got a job.

112
00:07:08,361 --> 00:07:09,563
[Thomas] What?

113
00:07:09,597 --> 00:07:11,732
Mama, how can you say
something like that?

114
00:07:11,765 --> 00:07:13,467
Yeah mama, that ain't right.

115
00:07:13,501 --> 00:07:14,678
Thomas has had a
tough day today.

116
00:07:14,702 --> 00:07:15,569
No, that's okay, baby.

117
00:07:15,603 --> 00:07:16,870
It's okay.

118
00:07:16,904 --> 00:07:18,906
I wouldn't expect her
to understand no way.

119
00:07:18,939 --> 00:07:21,575
Don't expect me to understand.

120
00:07:21,609 --> 00:07:23,877
I grew up in the era when
there wasn't no such thing

121
00:07:23,911 --> 00:07:27,047
as a job that pays a
Negro and here you are

122
00:07:27,080 --> 00:07:29,583
complaining about a promotion.

123
00:07:31,451 --> 00:07:34,154
They'd take you out
and beat you or worse.

124
00:07:34,187 --> 00:07:35,422
Son, you's a free man.

125
00:07:35,455 --> 00:07:38,091
You get to come home
everyday from your job

126
00:07:38,125 --> 00:07:40,928
to a home and a family
that belong to you.

127
00:07:40,961 --> 00:07:42,996
So what is some white
man is doing a job

128
00:07:43,030 --> 00:07:45,165
you think you can do better?

129
00:07:45,198 --> 00:07:47,200
Understand one
thing, the white man

130
00:07:47,234 --> 00:07:50,103
gonna always have a
bigger piece of the pie.

131
00:07:50,137 --> 00:07:54,508
Now he might leave you
the crumbs from the crust.

132
00:07:54,542 --> 00:07:56,977
You just take it and move on.

133
00:08:01,048 --> 00:08:04,484
See in my day we had
to pick our battles.

134
00:08:06,086 --> 00:08:08,355
Pick your battles wisely.

135
00:08:08,388 --> 00:08:09,966
So mama, you're saying I'm
just supposed to sit here,

136
00:08:09,990 --> 00:08:12,025
do nothing, and be
some hushed up Negro?

137
00:08:12,059 --> 00:08:16,163
That's exactly what I'm
saying you ought to do.

138
00:08:17,064 --> 00:08:18,566
So hush up, Negro.

139
00:08:20,500 --> 00:08:24,071
I done filed a
complaint already anyway.

140
00:08:24,104 --> 00:08:26,874
Yeah, maybe I need to
find me some Paul Robeson

141
00:08:26,907 --> 00:08:29,042
type fella to come in and
take a look at it, huh?

142
00:08:29,076 --> 00:08:32,479
No baby listen, just ask
God for favor and direction.

143
00:08:32,512 --> 00:08:33,881
He'll see you through.

144
00:08:33,914 --> 00:08:35,583
He always does.

145
00:08:35,616 --> 00:08:37,985
What in God's name taking
that boy so long to get home?

146
00:08:38,018 --> 00:08:39,663
Now he know better than to
be this late for dinner.

147
00:08:39,687 --> 00:08:41,388
Oh calm down, baby, calm down.

148
00:08:41,421 --> 00:08:42,756
He'll be here in a minute.

149
00:08:42,790 --> 00:08:45,092
You know how hard that
math is to master,

150
00:08:45,125 --> 00:08:47,294
and you know Lars
Jones is always on him.

151
00:08:47,327 --> 00:08:49,296
Got to get that
schooling in there.

152
00:08:49,329 --> 00:08:51,965
You got to have God's
passion in your soul,

153
00:08:51,999 --> 00:08:54,167
and you gotta have
hands that create.

154
00:08:54,201 --> 00:08:57,738
Or, as he would have said,
head, heart, and hands.

155
00:08:57,771 --> 00:08:59,248
All I know I'm gonna take
these hands right here,

156
00:08:59,272 --> 00:09:00,483
and go out there and get
me a switch from that tree

157
00:09:00,507 --> 00:09:02,018
if he don't get his butt
here in two minutes.

158
00:09:02,042 --> 00:09:03,510
Damn boy is holding things up.

159
00:09:03,543 --> 00:09:05,254
Now I want him to be a math
whiz, but not if I means

160
00:09:05,278 --> 00:09:06,680
we gonna starve to death.

161
00:09:06,714 --> 00:09:07,915
(window shattering)

162
00:09:07,948 --> 00:09:10,718
(dramatic music)

163
00:09:28,902 --> 00:09:31,471
Son, for 60 years
I fought the fight.

164
00:09:31,504 --> 00:09:34,775
Now it's up to you to
protect the family.

165
00:09:34,808 --> 00:09:37,310
Listen y'all stay
here and stay low.

00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,693
I'm about to nearly
lose my damn mind.

182
00:10:59,727 --> 00:11:02,062
Boy, I think you done lost
your mind already, Jericho.

183
00:11:02,095 --> 00:11:05,598
These are the same women
that was in here last week.

184
00:11:05,632 --> 00:11:06,743
It don't make no difference.

185
00:11:06,767 --> 00:11:07,935
Ain't that right, Jarvis?

186
00:11:07,968 --> 00:11:09,970
Skip, I don't know
what you talking about.

187
00:11:10,003 --> 00:11:11,380
I'm just a happily
married man trying to get

188
00:11:11,404 --> 00:11:12,405
a promotion.

189
00:11:13,506 --> 00:11:14,875
Man, a promotion?

190
00:11:14,908 --> 00:11:16,309
I'm tell y'all.

191
00:11:16,343 --> 00:11:18,154
They ain't gonna let this
civil rights law pass,

192
00:11:18,178 --> 00:11:19,813
and I'll put money on it.

193
00:11:19,847 --> 00:11:21,815
You know how bad I need money.

194
00:11:21,849 --> 00:11:23,984
Well why not, huh?

195
00:11:24,017 --> 00:11:26,619
It's time for a change.

196
00:11:26,653 --> 00:11:28,488
They've been enjoying
God's green grass

197
00:11:28,521 --> 00:11:32,760
for as long as my people
can remember, your people.

198
00:11:32,793 --> 00:11:35,228
I'll take you up
on that bet, sir.

199
00:11:35,262 --> 00:11:37,798
It'll be the easiest
damn money I ever made.

200
00:11:37,831 --> 00:11:38,999
You just watch and see.

201
00:11:39,032 --> 00:11:40,300
Okay all right.

202
00:11:40,333 --> 00:11:42,669
Now y'all remember
not even a year ago,

203
00:11:42,702 --> 00:11:45,638
the president just got
his head blown off,

204
00:11:45,672 --> 00:11:48,341
and if my memory serves
me correctly, I think they

205
00:11:48,375 --> 00:11:51,511
was trying to pass
the same Goddamn law.

206
00:11:51,544 --> 00:11:53,113
And, now you think
LBJ gonna stick

207
00:11:53,146 --> 00:11:55,783
his neck out for
our black asses?

208
00:11:55,816 --> 00:11:57,250
Nothing to say?

209
00:11:57,284 --> 00:11:58,986
Yeah, that's what I thought.

210
00:11:59,019 --> 00:12:01,321
And, even if it do
pass, shit I'm gonna let

211
00:12:01,354 --> 00:12:03,590
one of these other Negroes
apply, let them have

212
00:12:03,623 --> 00:12:05,692
to deal with
watching their back.

213
00:12:05,725 --> 00:12:07,594
Shit, if it ever
do pass, I'm gonna be

214
00:12:07,627 --> 00:12:09,329
the first Negro in line.

215
00:12:09,362 --> 00:12:10,798
I mean that.

216
00:12:10,831 --> 00:12:12,465
Back to my bet.

217
00:12:12,499 --> 00:12:14,835
I say we starting off at $2.

218
00:12:14,868 --> 00:12:16,203
Who in, anybody?

219
00:12:17,737 --> 00:12:18,638
Who in?

220
00:12:18,671 --> 00:12:20,707
Skip, let me borrow $2, man?

221
00:12:20,740 --> 00:12:22,709
Now you wait
just a damn minute.

222
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:25,045
Didn't I just let you
borrow $2 on Sunday

223
00:12:25,078 --> 00:12:26,546
to make it through the week?

224
00:12:26,579 --> 00:12:28,057
You just gonna
blow me out like that

225
00:12:28,081 --> 00:12:29,282
in front of everybody?

226
00:12:29,316 --> 00:12:31,284
I told you last week
was a long week, man.

227
00:12:31,318 --> 00:12:34,822
Plus she got me on
a damn fixed income.

228
00:12:34,855 --> 00:12:36,023
She sure do.

229
00:12:36,056 --> 00:12:37,566
You got it so damn fixed
you walk around here

230
00:12:37,590 --> 00:12:40,393
broker than a son of a
bitch with your tight ass.

231
00:12:40,427 --> 00:12:42,195
(laughing)

232
00:12:42,229 --> 00:12:44,898
I'll tell you what, I'm
gonna put $2 on it either way,

233
00:12:44,932 --> 00:12:47,000
and y'all can tell
me about it tomorrow.

234
00:12:47,034 --> 00:12:48,235
Where you going?

235
00:12:48,268 --> 00:12:49,636
We just got started.

236
00:12:49,669 --> 00:12:51,404
Sit down, man,
drink with us, man.

237
00:12:51,438 --> 00:12:53,740
No, I gotta get up early
in the morning for work.

238
00:12:53,773 --> 00:12:55,708
Look it's just another day.

239
00:12:55,742 --> 00:12:58,378
Civil Rights Act or
no Civil Rights Act,

240
00:12:58,411 --> 00:13:00,089
boss man gonna be looking
for me to run that machine

241
00:13:00,113 --> 00:13:01,648
in the morning.

242
00:13:01,681 --> 00:13:03,092
So while y'all sitting up
here wishing and dreaming,

243
00:13:03,116 --> 00:13:04,593
I'm gonna be at the house
yelling and screaming.

244
00:13:04,617 --> 00:13:06,019
(laughing)

245
00:13:06,053 --> 00:13:07,363
What your wife
gonna whoop your ass?

246
00:13:07,387 --> 00:13:09,256
(laughing)

247
00:13:09,289 --> 00:13:11,758
Old lady told me to have
my ass at home by 8:30.

248
00:13:11,791 --> 00:13:15,095
She got a little something for
me if you know what I mean?

249
00:13:15,128 --> 00:13:16,063
What you mean?

250
00:13:16,096 --> 00:13:17,197
Now you know what I mean.

251
00:13:17,230 --> 00:13:19,466
(laughing)

252
00:13:21,134 --> 00:13:22,769
Mr. Parsons, what's your take

253
00:13:22,802 --> 00:13:24,872
on this whole
civil rights thing?

254
00:13:24,905 --> 00:13:27,274
I really do think it's
a good thing in a way.

255
00:13:27,307 --> 00:13:28,541
Let me tell y'all something.

256
00:13:28,575 --> 00:13:30,577
Now Jarvis, you know I
worked with your daddy

257
00:13:30,610 --> 00:13:32,779
at that mill pretty
near 30 year.

258
00:13:32,812 --> 00:13:35,182
And, I seen these white
people walk all over him.

259
00:13:35,215 --> 00:13:37,117
He was the best man
down there at the mill.

260
00:13:37,150 --> 00:13:40,120
Walked over me too, hell I
even had to run moonshine

261
00:13:40,153 --> 00:13:41,354
one night.

262
00:13:41,388 --> 00:13:44,391
Hell I remember I
made $50 in six hours.

263
00:13:44,424 --> 00:13:46,026
$50?

264
00:13:46,059 --> 00:13:49,562
I woke up next morning
laying my uniform out

265
00:13:49,596 --> 00:13:52,599
ironed it real good,
bought me some new gloves

266
00:13:52,632 --> 00:13:54,801
and a brand new pair of boots.

267
00:13:54,834 --> 00:13:57,871
I walked in that morning,
and I told the boss man,

268
00:13:57,905 --> 00:14:01,308
"Sir, I'm here for
duty, and I'm quitting

269
00:14:01,341 --> 00:14:03,576
"at the same Goddamn time."

270
00:14:03,610 --> 00:14:04,611
That's what told him.

271
00:14:04,644 --> 00:14:05,445
Sure did.

272
00:14:05,478 --> 00:14:06,914
[Skip] Then what?

273
00:14:06,947 --> 00:14:08,157
Shit I started running
moonshine six nights a week.

274
00:14:08,181 --> 00:14:09,592
Shit, that's a lot
of money for a Negro

275
00:14:09,616 --> 00:14:10,750
back in those days.

276
00:14:10,783 --> 00:14:12,252
You can't make
that kind of money.

277
00:14:12,285 --> 00:14:13,963
Saved up enough money to
buy this place right here,

278
00:14:13,987 --> 00:14:17,557
and I ain't looked
back a day since.

279
00:14:17,590 --> 00:14:19,159
Up until right now.

280
00:14:20,027 --> 00:14:21,995
(laughing)

281
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,331
Oh shit, I gotta go
introduce my next act.

282
00:14:24,364 --> 00:14:26,934
Hey Jarvis, don't you be no
stranger around here, okay?

283
00:14:26,967 --> 00:14:28,335
[Jarvis] Okay.

284
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:31,071
Damn it if you don't
look like your daddy, Lord,

285
00:14:31,104 --> 00:14:32,605
if not more like me.

286
00:14:32,639 --> 00:14:33,974
(laughing)

287
00:14:34,007 --> 00:14:35,175
Say hey to your mom.

288
00:14:35,208 --> 00:14:36,443
Don't let us stop you.

289
00:14:36,476 --> 00:14:37,644

Y'all ready to have a good time?

293
00:14:42,382 --> 00:14:43,250
(cheering)

294
00:14:43,283 --> 00:14:44,184
I can't hear y'all.

295
00:14:44,217 --> 00:14:45,294
Y'all ready to have a good time?

296
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:46,519
(cheering)

297
00:14:46,553 --> 00:14:48,421
If you feel like it,
take your clothes off.

298
00:14:48,455 --> 00:14:50,590
Just have a good time
up in here, you hear me?

299
00:14:50,623 --> 00:14:52,035

We going to have some good
time up in here, all right?

302
00:14:55,395 --> 00:14:57,030
First of all, all you men.

303
00:14:57,064 --> 00:14:58,298
[Man] Yeah?

304
00:14:58,331 --> 00:14:59,808
Keep your tongue in
your mouth, and keep

305
00:14:59,832 --> 00:15:03,370
your billfold on the table
'cause at the end of the night,

306
00:15:03,403 --> 00:15:04,537
I'm gonna get it all.

307
00:15:04,571 --> 00:15:06,473
(laughing)

308
00:15:06,506 --> 00:15:07,874
Now listen, listen up.

309
00:15:07,907 --> 00:15:10,177
I've got some special
stuff for y'all tonight.

310
00:15:10,210 --> 00:15:12,712
All right, so get ready

311
00:15:12,745 --> 00:15:13,745

312
00:15:14,814 --> 00:15:17,684
Come on, make some
noise up in here.

313
00:15:18,918 --> 00:15:23,723

00:15:24,591 --> 00:15:29,596

317
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:37,404
Who the hell is that?

318
00:15:37,437 --> 00:15:40,040
(dramatic music)

319
00:15:40,073 --> 00:15:43,443
Georgia Perkins,
sweet Georgia Perkins.

320
00:15:51,384 --> 00:15:55,555
The only Negro woman employed
at Jennings Paper Mill.

321
00:15:56,956 --> 00:15:59,259
She must be keeping busy at
whatever the hell she doing

322
00:15:59,292 --> 00:16:01,161
'cause I ain't never seen her.

323
00:16:01,194 --> 00:16:03,330
Nobody know exactly
what she does.

324
00:16:03,363 --> 00:16:06,933
I see her leaving
first shift everyday.

325
00:16:06,966 --> 00:16:09,336
Sometimes before the first
shift ends if I get there

326
00:16:09,369 --> 00:16:10,937
early enough.

327
00:16:10,970 --> 00:16:12,672
Man, I don't give
a damn what she do.

328
00:16:12,705 --> 00:16:14,174
She could eat paper
for all I care.

329
00:16:14,207 --> 00:16:16,209
It's what I want to
do to her that got me

330
00:16:16,243 --> 00:16:18,245
feeling all warm on the inside.

331
00:16:18,278 --> 00:16:20,013
Oh Jimbo, stop.

332
00:16:20,047 --> 00:16:21,381
She ain't that kind of woman.

333
00:16:21,414 --> 00:16:22,749
Show some respect.

334
00:16:22,782 --> 00:16:23,583
What?

335
00:16:23,616 --> 00:16:24,784
Man, she can be got.

336
00:16:24,817 --> 00:16:26,386
I'm telling you all
of 'em can be got.

337
00:16:26,419 --> 00:16:28,688
Best believe that shit.

338
00:16:28,721 --> 00:16:31,124
Especially this one right here.

339
00:16:31,158 --> 00:16:32,559
Good God Almighty, damn!

340
00:16:32,592 --> 00:16:35,362
Look here, that
is a working woman.

341
00:16:35,395 --> 00:16:37,064
You see that woman
right over that,

342
00:16:37,097 --> 00:16:39,532
that fine, fine beautiful
woman over there

343
00:16:39,566 --> 00:16:40,609
sitting at that
table right there?

344
00:16:40,633 --> 00:16:42,135
She can't be bought.

345
00:16:42,169 --> 00:16:44,771
You gotta work to get that.

346
00:16:44,804 --> 00:16:47,640
It's all right for a brother
to dream sometimes though.

347
00:16:47,674 --> 00:16:49,142
Yeah.

348
00:16:49,176 --> 00:16:52,679
Hey Jericho, I bet you $2
that you won't go over there

349
00:16:53,780 --> 00:16:56,416
and see what that's
all about, $2.

350
00:16:57,484 --> 00:16:59,819
Skip, let me borrow $2, man.

351
00:17:01,954 --> 00:17:03,966
I ain't even been home
from work to clean up good.

352
00:17:03,990 --> 00:17:05,158
Jericho so what, man?

353
00:17:05,192 --> 00:17:06,459
You gonna let that get away?

354
00:17:06,493 --> 00:17:09,396
You gonna let that one pass?

355
00:17:09,429 --> 00:17:12,599
Hell no I ain't gonna

a monster burger as well.

I never took you
for a burger girl.

377
00:18:14,994 --> 00:18:17,063
Well It's been a
long day at work today,

378
00:18:17,096 --> 00:18:20,500
and I just wanted something
to stick to my bones.

379
00:18:20,533 --> 00:18:22,402
God Almighty, something
sure better stick

380
00:18:22,435 --> 00:18:23,236
to your bones.

381
00:18:23,270 --> 00:18:24,737
Excuse me?

382
00:18:24,771 --> 00:18:27,507
I said I can't wait till
they play the next song.

383
00:18:27,540 --> 00:18:29,752
Well I sure do hope that
they hurry up with that burger.

00:22:16,102 --> 00:22:18,137
What's a beautiful gal
like you doing working

449
00:22:18,170 --> 00:22:20,407
at a grind house like Jennings?

450
00:22:20,440 --> 00:22:22,975
Well some see it
as a grind house,

451
00:22:23,009 --> 00:22:26,145
but I don't really
see it that way.

452
00:22:26,178 --> 00:22:27,178
Oh I see.

453
00:22:29,248 --> 00:22:31,651
I don't mind them
bringing you on one bit.

454
00:22:31,684 --> 00:22:34,253
We could use another pretty
face around that place

455
00:22:34,286 --> 00:22:36,889
whether they working or
passing out sweat rags

456
00:22:36,923 --> 00:22:38,758
and tea cakes all day.

457
00:22:40,126 --> 00:22:41,528
What about you?

458
00:22:42,962 --> 00:22:45,898
Well there ain't nothing
too special about me.

459
00:22:45,932 --> 00:22:49,469
I'm just a guy that likes
to have a real good time.

460
00:22:49,502 --> 00:22:52,472
I see a beautiful gal
like you and say to myself

461
00:22:52,505 --> 00:22:54,073
why not Jericho?

462
00:22:54,106 --> 00:22:57,910
Why not go over there and see
if you can brighten her day?

463
00:22:57,944 --> 00:23:00,346
Well you certainly did that.

464
00:23:00,379 --> 00:23:02,682
But, what's your story?

465
00:23:02,715 --> 00:23:04,451
What's your mission?

466
00:23:04,484 --> 00:23:08,855
Well I got to admit
you caught me off guard

467
00:23:08,888 --> 00:23:10,523
with that one right there, baby.

468
00:23:10,557 --> 00:23:14,293
Every man has to have a
mission or a purpose in life,

469
00:23:14,326 --> 00:23:16,763
something to be
striving for, some plans

470
00:23:16,796 --> 00:23:18,865
to make a difference.

471
00:23:18,898 --> 00:23:20,933

all over your face.

472
00:23:20,967 --> 00:23:23,369
You look like somebody
who could really make

473
00:23:23,402 --> 00:23:25,672
a difference in this world.

474
00:23:27,073 --> 00:23:30,843
Well I got a friend named
Jarvis, and he got a mission.

475
00:23:34,046 --> 00:23:36,215
Crazy one, but at
least it's a mission.

476
00:23:36,248 --> 00:23:37,717
And, what's that?

477
00:23:37,750 --> 00:23:40,286
He wants to be the first
Negro paper press manager

478
00:23:40,319 --> 00:23:41,320
at Jennings.

479
00:23:42,188 --> 00:23:43,956
His daddy never could get it.

480
00:23:43,990 --> 00:23:46,626
He's been saying for years
he's gonna get that job.

481
00:23:46,659 --> 00:23:48,995
Old Thomas Cook senior
would be crying tears

482
00:23:49,028 --> 00:23:51,898
from the heavens above
if he ever did get it.

483
00:23:51,931 --> 00:23:55,835
There ain't no order too
tall for God if you believe.

484
00:23:55,868 --> 00:23:58,037
You do believe, don't you?

485
00:23:59,271 --> 00:24:00,406
Well...

486
00:24:00,439 --> 00:24:01,808

00:24:01,841 --> 00:24:03,042

488
00:24:03,075 --> 00:24:05,678
I have to work first
shift in the morning.

489
00:24:05,712 --> 00:24:06,746
Wait!

490
00:24:06,779 --> 00:24:07,714
Can I see you again?

491
00:24:07,747 --> 00:24:09,081
Let me take you out sometime.

492
00:24:09,115 --> 00:24:11,684
Be at my job before
first shift, and we can

493
00:24:11,718 --> 00:24:16,422

is you want to take me.

now and spend the night.

Jarvis, there's a
dozen Negroes in line

713
00:34:30,402 --> 00:34:32,771
waiting to take your
job at that plant.

714
00:34:32,804 --> 00:34:35,641
And, damn it I'm
one of 'em, shit.

715
00:34:36,742 --> 00:34:38,043
Wait.

716
00:34:38,076 --> 00:34:40,846
(dramatic music)

717
00:34:44,150 --> 00:34:46,318
You sure this a good idea?

718
00:34:47,819 --> 00:34:50,722
Jarvis, let me ask
you this one question.

719
00:34:50,756 --> 00:34:51,723
What?

720
00:34:51,757 --> 00:34:54,826
Have I ever led you wrong?

721
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:57,529
Yeah, all the damn time, yeah.

722
00:34:58,697 --> 00:35:00,832
Well there's a first
time for everything.

723
00:35:00,866 --> 00:35:02,534
Follow my damn lead.

724
00:35:06,605 --> 00:35:10,176
Hey, hey, Jericho,
hey look at this, man?

725
00:35:11,109 --> 00:35:13,379
[Jericho] What is it?

726
00:35:13,412 --> 00:35:15,581
Ain't that Miss Johnson's
grandson that's been

727
00:35:15,614 --> 00:35:17,616
missing since last week?

728
00:35:20,286 --> 00:35:21,753
Not that I knew of.

729
00:35:21,787 --> 00:35:22,921
I can't place the face.

730
00:35:22,954 --> 00:35:23,755
Stop playing.

731
00:35:23,789 --> 00:35:25,056
You know that's him.

732
00:35:25,090 --> 00:35:26,768
Maybe I do remember
him just a little bit.

733
00:35:26,792 --> 00:35:29,094
You know maybe he got lost
or ran away from home.

734
00:35:29,127 --> 00:35:30,229
Shit, I don't know.

735
00:35:30,262 --> 00:35:31,697
Ran away from home?

736
00:35:31,730 --> 00:35:32,598
When's the last time you
ever heard of a Negro child

737
00:35:32,631 --> 00:35:34,566
running away from home?

738
00:35:36,202 --> 00:35:38,770
Well Jarvis, what
you want me to say huh?

739
00:35:38,804 --> 00:35:40,772
Remember the promotion?

740
00:35:43,975 --> 00:35:47,246
Come on, let's get
the hell outta here.

741
00:35:49,648 --> 00:35:52,418
(dramatic music)

742
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,157
(car puttering)

743
00:36:14,306 --> 00:36:17,008
(dramatic music)

744
00:36:36,094 --> 00:36:37,128
Wait a minute.

745
00:36:37,162 --> 00:36:39,164
Hey, you think they saw us?

746
00:36:39,197 --> 00:36:41,333
Hell no, absolutely not.

747
00:36:41,367 --> 00:36:43,235
No way, no how.

748
00:36:43,269 --> 00:36:45,170
Then why you
running so damn fast?

749
00:36:45,203 --> 00:36:46,948
'Cause they might've
say your charcoal ass,

750
00:36:46,972 --> 00:36:48,483
and you know they think
all us Negroes look alike.

751
00:36:48,507 --> 00:36:51,610
And, I wasn't taking
no damn chances.

752
00:36:52,878 --> 00:36:54,613
[Woman] Roosevelt!

753
00:36:54,646 --> 00:36:55,646
Look.

754
00:36:57,349 --> 00:36:58,350
Roosevelt!

755
00:37:00,719 --> 00:37:03,455
(dramatic music)

756
00:37:13,131 --> 00:37:14,199
Roosevelt.

757
00:37:14,232 --> 00:37:15,334
Kitty, Kitty!

758
00:37:16,234 --> 00:37:17,303
Oh Roosevelt?

759
00:37:17,336 --> 00:37:18,770
Now where'd that cat go?

760
00:37:18,804 --> 00:37:20,806
Must've gone off yonder.

761
00:37:21,707 --> 00:37:22,708
Hey sweetie.

762
00:37:24,543 --> 00:37:26,612
Y'all are home early.

763
00:37:26,645 --> 00:37:28,780
Supper won't be ready
for at least two hours.

764
00:37:28,814 --> 00:37:30,549
I was just headed
off to Bible study

765
00:37:30,582 --> 00:37:32,484
when Roosevelt ran off.

766
00:37:32,518 --> 00:37:34,119
I don't think
that'd be a good idea.

767
00:37:34,152 --> 00:37:35,321
Well why not?

768
00:37:35,354 --> 00:37:37,889
'Cause me and the boys
is out coon hunting.

769
00:37:37,923 --> 00:37:41,192
We saw a few niggers
roaming around.

770
00:37:41,226 --> 00:37:42,628
We rushed home as
fast as we could

771
00:37:42,661 --> 00:37:44,296
to make sure y'all
was all right.

772
00:37:44,330 --> 00:37:45,631
Now where's Agnes.

773
00:37:45,664 --> 00:37:46,832
She ain't feeling well.

774
00:37:46,865 --> 00:37:48,734
She's inside nursing Cody.

775
00:37:48,767 --> 00:37:51,069
But, niggers in these parts?

776
00:37:51,102 --> 00:37:53,739
Haven't seen nobody
all day, I reckon.

777
00:37:53,772 --> 00:37:56,074
But, they know better than
to come anywhere near here.

778
00:37:56,107 --> 00:37:57,376
Hell Marcel, mama's right.

779
00:37:57,409 --> 00:37:59,077
Ain't not niggers
gonna come around here.

780
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,912
They know better than that.

781
00:38:00,946 --> 00:38:02,914
Did you get any coons?

782
00:38:02,948 --> 00:38:03,948
Just one.

783
00:38:06,852 --> 00:38:09,588
(dramatic music)

784
00:38:23,268 --> 00:38:24,779
Now if we can find
them other two boys

785
00:38:24,803 --> 00:38:28,940
Larry swears he saw, I
reckon we can call it a day.

786
00:38:28,974 --> 00:38:30,442
Is that the...

787
00:38:30,476 --> 00:38:32,243
Triple Lynch Mafia.

788
00:38:33,579 --> 00:38:34,579
Oh shit.

789
00:38:35,313 --> 00:38:38,116
(dramatic music)

790
00:38:42,721 --> 00:38:44,423
Ain't you got
something better to do

791
00:38:44,456 --> 00:38:47,393
than looking down
my Goddamn throat?

792
00:38:47,426 --> 00:38:48,660
Get inside now!

793
00:38:50,328 --> 00:38:51,539
You mention a word
of this to anybody,

794
00:38:51,563 --> 00:38:53,965
and I'll hang your
ass right next to him.

795
00:38:53,999 --> 00:38:56,768
(dramatic music)

796
00:39:05,110 --> 00:39:07,946
I thought I
recognized that boy.

797
00:39:09,314 --> 00:39:13,819
They got signs posted everywhere
looking for his black ass.

798
00:39:13,852 --> 00:39:15,987
Y'all gonna go all the way?

799
00:39:16,021 --> 00:39:19,324
Or, you gonna send him
home all beat to shit

800
00:39:19,357 --> 00:39:22,794
for a message to
those other coons?

801
00:39:22,828 --> 00:39:26,665
Mama look here these
niggers are everywhere.

802
00:39:28,033 --> 00:39:30,902
Now this whole bullshit
Civil Rights Act done passed,

803
00:39:30,936 --> 00:39:32,337
they'll be eating
at our restaurants

804
00:39:32,370 --> 00:39:33,839
and going to our schools.

805
00:39:33,872 --> 00:39:37,308
And before long, making
babies with our old ladies.

806
00:39:37,342 --> 00:39:38,977
Not this old lady.

807
00:39:39,010 --> 00:39:43,181
You got that shit
right with your old ass.

808
00:39:43,214 --> 00:39:46,618
I got a beautiful
family to protect.

809
00:39:46,652 --> 00:39:48,920
I gotta protect its future.

810
00:39:48,954 --> 00:39:53,091
And, in that future, niggers
are nowhere to be found.

811
00:39:53,124 --> 00:39:56,462
Well since you put it
like that, y'all have fun.

812
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:58,630
And, don't you
shit where you eat.

813
00:39:58,664 --> 00:40:00,131
Get that nigger outta here.

814
00:40:00,165 --> 00:40:02,009
Last thing I need is that
old sheriff coming here

815
00:40:02,033 --> 00:40:03,602
looking for that boy.

816
00:40:03,635 --> 00:40:06,304
Don't nobody care nothing
about a dead nigger.

817
00:40:06,337 --> 00:40:09,508
No more than a smashed
armadillo out in the road.

818
00:40:09,541 --> 00:40:10,709
I'm with you cousin.

819
00:40:10,742 --> 00:40:12,377
We gotta take care of
this nigger problem

820
00:40:12,410 --> 00:40:14,513
by any means necessary.

821
00:40:14,546 --> 00:40:16,114
Do you hear this?

822
00:40:16,147 --> 00:40:19,050
If Malcolm X could see
this shit right here.

823
00:40:19,084 --> 00:40:22,020
Man, let's make a
nice, quiet exit.

824
00:40:23,254 --> 00:40:25,657
Oh man, we can't do that.

825
00:40:25,691 --> 00:40:27,225
How you gonna use
Malcolm X name,

826
00:40:27,258 --> 00:40:28,670
and then the next
sentence out your mouth,

827
00:40:28,694 --> 00:40:30,295
you talk about running?

828
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,897
It ain't right, Jericho.

829
00:40:31,930 --> 00:40:34,165
We just can't leave
him like that.

830
00:40:34,199 --> 00:40:36,968
Oh yes the hell we can.

831
00:40:37,002 --> 00:40:40,539
Shit, you hear these crazy
ass white folks talking like?

832
00:40:40,572 --> 00:40:42,908
Remember Triple Lynch Mafia?

833
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,319
Look I don't want
these son of a bitches

834
00:40:45,343 --> 00:40:47,078
to meet their quota
on our account.

835
00:40:47,112 --> 00:40:48,490
Man, let's get out
asses on up outta here.

836
00:40:48,514 --> 00:40:50,348
It ain't right, Jericho.

837
00:40:50,381 --> 00:40:54,252
And, I just can't let
it go down like that.

838
00:40:54,285 --> 00:40:58,256
You go ahead and go
on if you want to go.

839
00:40:58,289 --> 00:40:59,357
I understand.

840
00:41:07,699 --> 00:41:08,699
Wait.

841
00:41:10,068 --> 00:41:12,904
If we gonna do it,
we need a plan.

842
00:41:14,072 --> 00:41:15,641
And, I got an idea.

843
00:41:19,778 --> 00:41:20,579
(soul music)

844
00:41:20,612 --> 00:41:21,847
What the hell is that?

845
00:41:21,880 --> 00:41:23,181
I don't know.

846
00:41:23,214 --> 00:41:25,116
Sounds like some
old nigger shit.

847
00:41:25,150 --> 00:41:26,084

me, and they took me away

They were calling

They was so close, but
they told me to be quiet,

They won't come out,
we'll burn 'em out.

1013
00:50:31,929 --> 00:50:34,599
They were in a world
of trouble for sure.

Jericho was a lot more clever

1016
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,113
than he looked.

1017
00:50:48,146 --> 00:50:51,048
Beneath all of
those steak dinners,

1018
00:50:53,151 --> 00:50:55,220
was a true gift from God.

1019
00:50:57,355 --> 00:51:01,092
And, he was gonna
have to dig real deep

1020
00:51:01,126 --> 00:51:04,462
if they was gonna get
out of this alive.

1021
00:51:06,497 --> 00:51:07,298
Jarvis.

1022
00:51:07,332 --> 00:51:08,332
What?

1023
00:51:09,567 --> 00:51:11,636
I got an idea.

1024
00:51:11,669 --> 00:51:12,669
What?

1025
00:51:13,704 --> 00:51:18,143
I got you into this,
I'm gonna get you out.

1026
00:51:18,176 --> 00:51:19,877
Lord, forgive me.

1027
00:51:19,910 --> 00:51:20,711
What?

1028
00:51:20,745 --> 00:51:23,047
(grunting)

1029
00:51:26,817 --> 00:51:29,587
(dramatic music)

1030
00:51:36,927 --> 00:51:39,964
Now what in God's name
took you boys so long.

1031
00:51:39,997 --> 00:51:41,899
Who in the hell are you?

1032
00:51:41,932 --> 00:51:44,135
Let me tell you who
the hell I am, buddy.

1033
00:51:44,169 --> 00:51:45,169
I'm Dale

1034
00:52:01,452 --> 00:52:04,989
Stevens, and I'm from the
deepest, darkest parts

1035
00:52:05,022 --> 00:52:08,259
of Shannon, Mississippi,
and every once in awhile

1036
00:52:08,293 --> 00:52:10,761
I come up here to do
a little coon hunting.

1037
00:52:10,795 --> 00:52:13,831
But, this time look like
the coon done come to me.

1038
00:52:13,864 --> 00:52:15,065
Hold on.

1039
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:17,368
Now we was chasing two
niggers, I'm sure of it.

1040
00:52:17,402 --> 00:52:20,405
And, I'm also sure both of
'em ran into this here house.

1041
00:52:20,438 --> 00:52:22,407
Two fellas got the jump on me.

1042
00:52:22,440 --> 00:52:24,909
By the time I got
the upper hand,

1043
00:52:24,942 --> 00:52:26,577
the other feller got away.

1044
00:52:26,611 --> 00:52:28,913
Which way that
Goddamn nigger go?

1045
00:52:28,946 --> 00:52:30,215
I ain't sure.

1046
00:52:30,248 --> 00:52:31,616
It was all a blur.

1047
00:52:31,649 --> 00:52:33,618
All I know is he run
off saying something

1048
00:52:33,651 --> 00:52:36,421
about you boys were dumber
than shit, and he was

1049
00:52:36,454 --> 00:52:39,089
gonna go back to your
house and give your wife

1050
00:52:39,123 --> 00:52:43,294
a good busting up if
you know what I mean?

1051
00:52:43,328 --> 00:52:45,296
Are you bullshitting me, sir?

1052
00:52:45,330 --> 00:52:47,131
Honest to my Lord and Savior.

1053
00:52:47,164 --> 00:52:49,567
That joker said he had
eight and a half inches

1054
00:52:49,600 --> 00:52:52,737
of Alabama black
snake, all right?

1055
00:52:52,770 --> 00:52:54,472
Alabama black snake!

1056
00:52:54,505 --> 00:52:58,042
Yes sir, and it scared
the piss outta me too

1057
00:52:58,075 --> 00:53:00,945
'cause I know how much
wood these colored boys

1058
00:53:00,978 --> 00:53:02,313
are packing these days.

1059
00:53:02,347 --> 00:53:04,249
If that Goddamn nigger
went to the house,

1060
00:53:04,282 --> 00:53:05,983
we'd of saw his black ass!

1061
00:53:06,016 --> 00:53:08,553
I'll hang that burly
nigger and shoot him dead

1062
00:53:08,586 --> 00:53:11,989

the thought of...

1063
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,659
Now Marcel, all
I'm saying is...

1064
00:53:14,692 --> 00:53:15,692

How'd you like some coon
pounding your old lady out?

1066
00:53:20,298 --> 00:53:21,866
Yeah, I thought so.

1067
00:53:29,039 --> 00:53:31,309
(laughing)

1068
00:53:32,477 --> 00:53:35,313
You're one crazy
son of a bitch.

1069
00:53:35,346 --> 00:53:37,448
Man, if I didn't know no
better, I thought you was

1070
00:53:37,482 --> 00:53:40,685
a real life sure enough
hillbilly standing behind me.

1071
00:53:40,718 --> 00:53:42,195
And, all that shit you
was talking about going

1072
00:53:42,219 --> 00:53:44,255
to busting up his old lady.

1073
00:53:44,289 --> 00:53:46,291
I damn near had
to bite my tongue.

1074
00:53:46,324 --> 00:53:47,992
Jarvis, don't worry about it.

1075
00:53:48,025 --> 00:53:49,126
I didn't mean a word of it.

1076
00:53:49,159 --> 00:53:51,161
I made all that shit up.

1077
00:53:54,399 --> 00:53:55,399
Damn man.

1078
00:53:56,534 --> 00:54:00,838
Fooling with this shit,
missed our interview,

1079
00:54:00,871 --> 00:54:02,840
a whole day's work.

1080
00:54:02,873 --> 00:54:07,111
Maybe so, maybe at least
we can save our damn jobs.

1081
00:54:07,144 --> 00:54:09,514
God damn, ain't no way
that niggers gonna make

1082
00:54:09,547 --> 00:54:10,881
a fool outta me.

1083
00:54:12,082 --> 00:54:14,452
Hurry your slow
driving ass up, shit!

1084
00:54:14,485 --> 00:54:17,322
Hell Marcel, I'm
driving as fast as I can!

1085
00:54:17,355 --> 00:54:19,757
(rock music)

1086
00:54:42,913 --> 00:54:43,913
Oh man.

1087
00:54:46,451 --> 00:54:47,652
What?

1088
00:54:47,685 --> 00:54:49,420
Jarvis, you ever
wanted something

1089
00:54:49,454 --> 00:54:51,622
so bad you could taste it?

1090
00:54:53,591 --> 00:54:55,092
Yeah I guess so.

1091
00:54:56,126 --> 00:54:59,296
Well I got the
newspaper this morning,

1092
00:55:00,465 --> 00:55:03,868
and this place had half
off a chicken dinner.

1093
00:55:04,935 --> 00:55:07,738
What you think about that?

1094
00:55:07,772 --> 00:55:09,940
Well Jericho that
sounds good n'all,

1095
00:55:09,974 --> 00:55:12,276
and I hear what you
saying, but don't you see

1096
00:55:12,309 --> 00:55:14,945
that big ass sign right there?

1097
00:55:14,979 --> 00:55:16,614
And, I don't this
it's a misprint.

1098
00:55:16,647 --> 00:55:18,115
I think they meant
to right that shit

1099
00:55:18,148 --> 00:55:19,950
exactly like it says.

1100
00:55:22,787 --> 00:55:24,555
I'm so tired of this, Jarvis!

1101
00:55:24,589 --> 00:55:25,723
Tired of what?

1102
00:55:25,756 --> 00:55:26,756
This!

1103
00:55:27,792 --> 00:55:29,627
Tired of being told I
can't do this or that

1104
00:55:29,660 --> 00:55:33,330
or go here or there all
because I'm a Negro.

1105
00:55:37,502 --> 00:55:38,502
Guess what.

1106
00:55:39,437 --> 00:55:40,938
What?

1107
00:55:40,971 --> 00:55:45,109
Today two of the blackest
jokers this town's ever seen

1108
00:55:45,142 --> 00:55:48,813
is gonna sit down and
have a chicken dinner.

1109
00:55:48,846 --> 00:55:52,182
After all, I am white
if only for a day.

1110
00:55:53,117 --> 00:55:54,117
Hey look.

1111
00:55:55,185 --> 00:55:56,329
They gonna think
it's a full eclipse

1112
00:55:56,353 --> 00:55:58,423
when we take your
black ass off in there.

1113
00:55:58,456 --> 00:55:59,900
Hell no, I'm not
going off in there.

1114
00:55:59,924 --> 00:56:02,427
You ain't gonna get me killed.

1115
00:56:02,460 --> 00:56:04,662
You done tried once today.

1116
00:56:04,695 --> 00:56:06,664
I'm not going off in there.

1117
00:56:06,697 --> 00:56:09,099
Now Jarvis, look,
if we ain't dead

1118
00:56:09,133 --> 00:56:11,436
after all the shit
we done been through,

1119
00:56:11,469 --> 00:56:14,104
one piece of chicken
ain't gonna be the straw

1120
00:56:14,138 --> 00:56:16,474
that broke the camel's back.

1121
00:56:17,775 --> 00:56:21,446
Only question is do you
want yours smothered

1122
00:56:22,780 --> 00:56:24,615
or extra crispy?

1123
00:56:24,649 --> 00:56:27,384
(dramatic music)

1124
00:56:45,903 --> 00:56:48,405
(tense music)

1125
00:57:11,762 --> 00:57:15,900
Boy, didn't you see that
big ass sign out there?

1126
00:57:15,933 --> 00:57:18,302
Yes mam, I saw it.

1127
00:57:18,335 --> 00:57:20,037
But, I thought since
the Civil Rights Act

1128
00:57:20,070 --> 00:57:21,572
was just passed
today, I'd come on in

1129
00:57:21,606 --> 00:57:23,207
and have me a meal.

1130
00:57:24,374 --> 00:57:27,377
You see it says so right
here in the newspaper.

1131
00:57:27,411 --> 00:57:29,880
And, right next to it
is your ad for half off

1132
00:57:29,914 --> 00:57:31,248
a chicken dinner.

1133
00:57:31,281 --> 00:57:33,984
Well news travels
slow around these parts.

1134
00:57:34,018 --> 00:57:36,987
People ain't even
read it here yet.

1135
00:57:37,021 --> 00:57:41,258
And, frankly I don't
give a shit what it says.

1136
00:57:41,291 --> 00:57:44,595
We don't serve your kind
in here no way, no how.

1137
00:57:44,629 --> 00:57:46,597
You best be moving on.

1138
00:57:46,631 --> 00:57:49,534
But mam, you can't
deny my a chicken dinner.

1139
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:50,935

1140
00:57:50,968 --> 00:57:52,770

1142
00:57:55,305 --> 00:57:56,373

00:58:24,669 --> 00:58:29,373
Jericho realized how much
fun he could have as Dale.

1150
00:58:29,406 --> 00:58:32,810
And, she enjoyed every
square inch of it.

but I mean I understand
he's your help n'all,

1157
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:55,299
but he ain't got no business
here in this restaurant.

1158
00:58:55,332 --> 00:58:56,667
Help?

1159
00:58:56,701 --> 00:58:58,969
Why this is my
son-in-law right here,

1160
00:58:59,003 --> 00:59:00,681
and he's been screaming
about a piece of chicken

1161
00:59:00,705 --> 00:59:04,842
all damn day every since
he saw the ad in the paper.

1162
00:59:06,276 --> 00:59:09,880
Why don't you go fetch him
a drumstick or two, darling?

1163
00:59:12,049 --> 00:59:14,184
Did you say son-in-law?

1164
00:59:15,620 --> 00:59:19,790
You know what, I never
thought you'd amount to much.

1165
00:59:20,891 --> 00:59:23,594
I'll never forget the
night I come home,

1166
00:59:23,628 --> 00:59:27,765
we found you fiving a pushing
to my daughter's cushion.

1167
00:59:27,798 --> 00:59:30,100
Pushing to her cushion?

1168
00:59:30,134 --> 00:59:31,501
What is this shit?

1169
00:59:31,535 --> 00:59:33,003
I'm not putting up with it.

1170
00:59:33,037 --> 00:59:37,007
Now Gertrude, I've been
eating here for 30 years.

1171
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:42,246
Is this what this come to us
sharing spoons with niggers?

1172
00:59:43,413 --> 00:59:44,413
Let's go.

1173
00:59:45,683 --> 00:59:46,884
That's it!

1174
00:59:46,917 --> 00:59:48,385
Get him outta here!

1175
00:59:48,418 --> 00:59:51,622
You boys are running off
good paying customers.

1176
00:59:51,656 --> 00:59:54,825
Okay, we'll leave, but I
don't see no more than two cars

1177
00:59:54,859 --> 00:59:57,061
parked outside and
one of 'em is yours.

1178
00:59:57,094 --> 01:00:00,397
Now business ain't exactly
booming around here.

1179
01:00:00,430 --> 01:00:04,268
Now Jim Crow going away
is good for everybody.

1180
01:00:05,670 --> 01:00:08,706
I know a town full of
Negroes that just love

1181
01:00:08,739 --> 01:00:11,909
home cooking like
this here which means

1182
01:00:11,942 --> 01:00:14,078
more business for you.

1183
01:00:14,111 --> 01:00:17,481
And, I also know
Negroes that need jobs

1184
01:00:17,514 --> 01:00:21,185
because guess what when
business starts picking up

1185
01:00:21,218 --> 01:00:25,990

more dishes need washing,

1186
01:00:26,023 --> 01:00:28,893
a lot more biscuits
need bacon, baby.

1187

01:02:38,088 --> 01:02:39,857
Oh praise the Lord.

1243
01:02:39,890 --> 01:02:41,892
Oh thank you, Jesus.

1244
01:02:41,926 --> 01:02:46,797
You give us bacon, eggs,
and toast every morning.

1245
01:02:46,831 --> 01:02:48,232
Thank you, Jesus.

1246
01:02:49,166 --> 01:02:50,166
Oh yeah.

1247
01:02:51,335 --> 01:02:52,736
There she is.

1248
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,438
Oh thank you, Jesus.

1249
01:02:59,343 --> 01:03:00,210
Son?

1250
01:03:00,244 --> 01:03:01,245
EJ!

1251
01:03:01,278 --> 01:03:04,048
(dramatic music)

1252
01:03:05,782 --> 01:03:07,684
[Marcel] Where is he?

1253
01:03:15,625 --> 01:03:17,561
Marcel, look at this!

1254
01:03:19,964 --> 01:03:22,699
(dramatic music)

1255
01:03:28,472 --> 01:03:29,273
Jarvis.

1256
01:03:29,306 --> 01:03:30,507
[Jarvis] What?

1257
01:03:30,540 --> 01:03:31,952
Looks like they're
in between shifts.

1258
01:03:31,976 --> 01:03:33,277
I can't go in there like this.

1259
01:03:33,310 --> 01:03:34,711
Yeah, you right.

1260
01:03:34,744 --> 01:03:35,612
Now would be the
perfect time for me to get

1261
01:03:35,645 --> 01:03:36,180
all this stuff off my face.

1262
01:03:36,213 --> 01:03:36,947
Okay.

1263
01:03:36,981 --> 01:03:37,714
See you in a minute.

1264
01:03:37,747 --> 01:03:38,748
All right.

1265
01:03:44,288 --> 01:03:47,624
Don't you two have
some explaining to do?

1266
01:03:47,657 --> 01:03:50,560
Mr. Munson, I know we
late, but I can explain.

1267
01:03:50,594 --> 01:03:52,196
It was all my fault.

1268
01:03:52,229 --> 01:03:54,698
You see I had the runs
real bad this morning.

1269
01:03:54,731 --> 01:03:58,402
I was fresh out of shit
paper, but this man.

1270
01:03:59,603 --> 01:04:01,638
This man right here,
gave me the shirt

1271
01:04:01,671 --> 01:04:03,740
off his back so I
could wipe my own ass.

1272
01:04:03,773 --> 01:04:06,110
So that's why we late
because that's the kind

1273
01:04:06,143 --> 01:04:07,912
of human being he is.

1274
01:04:07,945 --> 01:04:11,949
The integrity, the fortitude
of this human being right here.

1275
01:04:11,982 --> 01:04:14,751
Mr. Munson, I
can explain look...

1276
01:04:14,784 --> 01:04:18,622
Then we got robbed
by a gang of midgets.

1277
01:04:18,655 --> 01:04:20,824
They stole my car.

1278
01:04:20,857 --> 01:04:23,660
Then they crashed it into a tree

1279
01:04:23,693 --> 01:04:26,096
'cause the bastards couldn't
see over the steering wheel.

1280
01:04:26,130 --> 01:04:27,898
Mr. Munson, Mr. Muson look...

1281
01:04:27,932 --> 01:04:29,433
My daddy gave me that car.

1282
01:04:29,466 --> 01:04:32,669
Mr. Munson look
it was all my fault.

1283
01:04:32,702 --> 01:04:35,339
Okay now I know I should've
made it here on time,

1284
01:04:35,372 --> 01:04:40,177
but, you see, the truth is I
really need that promotion.

1285
01:04:40,210 --> 01:04:41,912
If I get that job,
I can really change

1286
01:04:41,946 --> 01:04:43,347
my family's life.

1287
01:04:45,382 --> 01:04:48,518
Mr. Munson, you know
I can do that job.

1288
01:04:48,552 --> 01:04:51,821
I just need you
to believe in me.

1289
01:04:51,855 --> 01:04:53,257
Please sir.

1290
01:04:53,290 --> 01:04:54,624
I'm sorry, son.

1291
01:04:54,658 --> 01:04:58,095
I've already given that
job to somebody else.

1292
01:04:58,128 --> 01:05:01,031
Now listen you're
an excellent worker.

1293
01:05:01,065 --> 01:05:02,699
Everybody here knows it.

1294
01:05:02,732 --> 01:05:05,302
But, there's nothing
more I can do.

1295
01:05:05,335 --> 01:05:07,071
Maybe next time, son.

1296
01:05:08,572 --> 01:05:11,808
Now I've got the second
shift starting in 15 minutes,

1297
01:05:11,841 --> 01:05:14,044
and I reckon I can use
you two on that shift.

1298
01:05:14,078 --> 01:05:17,047
That is if you could
still use a day's work,

1299
01:05:17,081 --> 01:05:18,882
but you guys look a mess.

1300
01:05:18,915 --> 01:05:21,218
Go get changed into
some clean uniforms

1301
01:05:21,251 --> 01:05:23,988
and head out to the
station with the new crew.

1302
01:05:24,021 --> 01:05:25,855
- Yes, sir.
- Yes, sir.

1303
01:05:27,091 --> 01:05:28,792
I tell you right
now, reverend.

1304
01:05:28,825 --> 01:05:30,860
We've got to do something!

1305
01:05:30,894 --> 01:05:32,963
We just can't sit around
here and let these monsters

1306
01:05:32,997 --> 01:05:35,399
abduct and murder our children.

1307
01:05:35,432 --> 01:05:37,234
(clapping)

1308
01:05:37,267 --> 01:05:41,238
And, just exactly what would
you have us do, Greg huh?

1309
01:05:41,271 --> 01:05:44,574
What in Jesus's name can we do?

1310
01:05:44,608 --> 01:05:48,545
If we retaliate, we'll all
be dead before sundown.

1311
01:05:48,578 --> 01:05:51,915
I suggest we just
stay out the way

1312
01:05:51,948 --> 01:05:54,084
and let things blow over.

1313
01:05:54,118 --> 01:05:55,852
Blow over?

1314
01:05:55,885 --> 01:05:58,488
Man, they done damn near
killed this boy right here,

1315
01:05:58,522 --> 01:06:00,424
ain't no telling what
in the hell they've done

1316
01:06:00,457 --> 01:06:02,192
to these people
here, and you want

1317
01:06:02,226 --> 01:06:03,493
to let it blow over?

1318
01:06:03,527 --> 01:06:05,195
Hell that could've
been one of our kids,

1319
01:06:05,229 --> 01:06:08,098
could've been one of
your kids or your kids.

1320
01:06:08,132 --> 01:06:10,267
And, even yours
Reverend Aberdeen.

1321
01:06:10,300 --> 01:06:13,070
And, this all because
the color of our skin.

1322
01:06:13,103 --> 01:06:16,240
Well I say we don't
just sit back.

1323
01:06:16,273 --> 01:06:18,575
We've gots to do something
before they slowly

1324
01:06:18,608 --> 01:06:21,278
but surely wipe out
what's left of us.

1325
01:06:21,311 --> 01:06:23,113
You know what, damn
it, I'm pissed now!

1326
01:06:23,147 --> 01:06:24,514
I'm mad as hell.

1327
01:06:24,548 --> 01:06:26,083
We've got to do something.

1328
01:06:26,116 --> 01:06:28,718
I say let's take
the fight to them!

1329
01:06:28,752 --> 01:06:31,121
Let's take the fight to them!

1330
01:06:31,155 --> 01:06:33,890
Let's take the drama to
their mamas, how 'bout that?

1331
01:06:33,923 --> 01:06:35,125
See how it feel, huh!

1332
01:06:35,159 --> 01:06:37,894
Let's take the heat
and not damn retreat.

1333
01:06:37,927 --> 01:06:41,965
Let's bring the thunder
and let them wonder.

1334
01:06:41,998 --> 01:06:44,968
And, let's bring the
pain and make it rain.

1335
01:06:45,001 --> 01:06:47,471
(clapping)

1336
01:06:47,504 --> 01:06:49,073
Y'all crazy.

1337
01:06:49,106 --> 01:06:51,141
You gonna get yourself killed.

1338
01:06:51,175 --> 01:06:52,742
No, Mr. Montgomery.

1339
01:06:52,776 --> 01:06:54,478
Hey, now that's what
I'm talking about.

1340
01:06:54,511 --> 01:06:56,813
(laughing)

1341
01:06:56,846 --> 01:06:58,982
You done ignited a fire
inside me this afternoon,

1342
01:06:59,015 --> 01:07:00,284
Mr. Parsons.

1343
01:07:00,317 --> 01:07:01,451
Huh?

1344
01:07:01,485 --> 01:07:03,125
I'm gonna be following
right behind you.

1345
01:07:03,153 --> 01:07:04,421
Follow me?

1346
01:07:04,454 --> 01:07:07,824
Oh hell no, I'm too
old for this shit.

1347
01:07:07,857 --> 01:07:10,127
I was just giving y'all
some ideas of some stuff

1348
01:07:10,160 --> 01:07:11,328
y'all can do.

1349
01:07:11,361 --> 01:07:13,330
I'm gonna sit my black
ass down over there,

1350
01:07:13,363 --> 01:07:14,764
and I'm gonna pray for y'all.

1351
01:07:14,798 --> 01:07:17,601
Reverend Aberdeen gonna
lead y'all to victory.

1352
01:07:17,634 --> 01:07:20,104
Aint' that right,
Reverend Aberdeen?

1353
01:07:20,137 --> 01:07:22,906
Ain't that right,
Reverend Aberdeen?

1354
01:07:22,939 --> 01:07:25,075
I said ain't that right,
Reverend Aberdeen,

1355
01:07:25,109 --> 01:07:27,077
ain't that right?

1356
01:07:27,111 --> 01:07:28,212
Say Jarvis?

1357
01:07:29,179 --> 01:07:30,179
Yeah.

1358
01:07:31,381 --> 01:07:34,851
Man, I'm really
sorry about everything.

1359
01:07:36,653 --> 01:07:40,824
I mean the promotion, all the
trouble I caused you today.

1360
01:07:44,394 --> 01:07:48,198
I know it's my fault you
didn't get that job today.

1361
01:07:48,232 --> 01:07:51,735
I never wanted things
to end up like this.

1362
01:07:53,137 --> 01:07:55,539
And, all because I
was too lazy to take

1363
01:07:55,572 --> 01:07:57,841
the safe route to get here.

1364
01:08:00,244 --> 01:08:04,047
You know Jericho, don't
even worry about it.

1365
01:08:07,016 --> 01:08:10,454
I mean you are lazy, but none
of this could've happened

1366
01:08:10,487 --> 01:08:12,088
if I didn't let it.

1367
01:08:14,023 --> 01:08:15,692
Could've put my foot
down and stopped us

1368
01:08:15,725 --> 01:08:19,196
from going through
Mr. Edwards's land.

1369
01:08:19,229 --> 01:08:22,732
Oh you don't think I
could've stopped you?

1370
01:08:24,734 --> 01:08:26,336
Look I know I like
to play it safe,

1371
01:08:26,370 --> 01:08:30,207
but I guess at the end
of the day, I just want

1372
01:08:32,041 --> 01:08:34,043
to take a leap of faith.

1373
01:08:35,779 --> 01:08:38,348
And, I appreciate you for
being that loose cannon

1374
01:08:38,382 --> 01:08:41,084
that always pushed me, you know?

1375
01:08:42,286 --> 01:08:45,789
Always ready and willing
to take a chance.

1376
01:08:49,459 --> 01:08:51,928
I mean things didn't
work out, but just think

1377
01:08:51,961 --> 01:08:52,961
if it did.

1378
01:08:56,633 --> 01:08:59,035
Look in this messed
up world we live in

1379
01:08:59,068 --> 01:09:00,870
every Negro around
here is scared,

1380
01:09:00,904 --> 01:09:03,940
scared to take a
chance, and as a result,

1381
01:09:03,973 --> 01:09:07,411
there ain't no progress
being made, none.

1382
01:09:10,480 --> 01:09:13,783
This town needs more
men just like you.

1383
01:09:15,219 --> 01:09:16,786
Yeah, just like you

1384
01:09:18,322 --> 01:09:20,957
who ain't scared,
scared to take a chance,

1385
01:09:20,990 --> 01:09:24,561
who ain't afraid of the
dangers around the corner

1386
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:26,763
or the road less traveled.

1387
01:09:30,467 --> 01:09:34,638
Whatever the case, I'm just
thankful you're my best friend.

1388
01:09:34,671 --> 01:09:36,740
(crying)

1389
01:09:38,442 --> 01:09:41,278
I mean you did
save my life today.

1390
01:09:42,279 --> 01:09:43,279
I did.

1391
01:09:44,781 --> 01:09:47,717
Look finish getting dressed.

1392
01:09:47,751 --> 01:09:48,994
I'm gonna go on
out and get started

1393
01:09:49,018 --> 01:09:51,255
on prepping the machine.

1394
01:09:51,288 --> 01:09:52,556
All right man.

1395
01:09:52,589 --> 01:09:55,659
Don't wanna screw this
second chance we got.

1396
01:09:55,692 --> 01:09:58,495
One thing I know for
sure ain't no third shit

1397
01:09:58,528 --> 01:10:00,497
around this place.

1398
01:10:00,530 --> 01:10:02,165
Man, you got that shit right.

1399
01:10:02,198 --> 01:10:03,933
All right, I'll
see you out there.

1400
01:10:03,967 --> 01:10:06,303
Thank you, man, thank you.

1402
01:10:21,685 --> 01:10:26,690

These white men are after 'em.

1409
01:10:47,411 --> 01:10:49,879
I think they're gonna kill him.

1410
01:10:49,913 --> 01:10:51,848
Baby, it's gonna be
all right, I promise you.

1411

Now you wait right here.

1412

the damn commotion

1413
01:10:57,487 --> 01:10:59,889
going on around here?

1414
01:10:59,923 --> 01:11:01,558
Hit him, boy, hit him!

1415
01:11:01,591 --> 01:11:04,528
(fleshy crunching)

1416
01:11:05,762 --> 01:11:06,762
Jericho?

1417
01:11:08,164 --> 01:11:09,699
Jericho?

1418
01:11:09,733 --> 01:11:12,436
(dramatic music)

1419
01:11:15,939 --> 01:11:16,939
Help!

1420
01:11:18,174 --> 01:11:19,174
Marcel?

1421
01:11:20,276 --> 01:11:22,379
What's the meaning of all this?

1422
01:11:22,412 --> 01:11:23,589
You have no right to
come on this property

1423
01:11:23,613 --> 01:11:24,748
and do this to my workers!

1424
01:11:24,781 --> 01:11:25,882
I'll have you arrested!

1425
01:11:25,915 --> 01:11:28,117
(grunting)

1426
01:11:30,454 --> 01:11:33,323
Wait, I'm on your side, shit!

1427
01:11:33,357 --> 01:11:35,692
(grumbling)

1428
01:11:42,799 --> 01:11:46,736
[Reverend Aberdeen] All
right Buford, let him go.

1429
01:11:46,770 --> 01:11:49,573
Clark, this ain't your fight.

1430
01:11:49,606 --> 01:11:53,777
I suggest y'all go back
and mind your own business.

1431
01:11:55,912 --> 01:11:58,047
Man, what the
hell is going on?

1432
01:11:58,081 --> 01:12:00,550
(tense music)

1433
01:12:00,584 --> 01:12:02,218
(gun firing)

1434
01:12:02,251 --> 01:12:04,754
(tense music)

1435
01:12:08,825 --> 01:12:10,293
Get your hands off that boy.

1436
01:12:10,326 --> 01:12:13,129
Ain't you got no
respect for human life?

1437
01:12:13,162 --> 01:12:15,599
I oughta blow your
Goddamn brains out

1438
01:12:15,632 --> 01:12:16,976
for all the heartache
you guys done caused

1439
01:12:17,000 --> 01:12:18,234
around here.

1440
01:12:18,267 --> 01:12:20,470
Am I hearing you
correctly, sir?

1441
01:12:20,504 --> 01:12:22,548
If you'd've hung this nigger
when you were supposed to,

1442
01:12:22,572 --> 01:12:24,240
we wouldn't be here.

1443
01:12:24,273 --> 01:12:26,643
Now I don't know
how he got loose,

1444
01:12:26,676 --> 01:12:30,647
but I reckon he ain't
gonna get away this time.

1445
01:12:30,680 --> 01:12:32,749
Why didn't you kill him?

1446
01:12:32,782 --> 01:12:35,819
I guess 'cause deep
down I ain't no killer,

1447
01:12:35,852 --> 01:12:39,556
and besides we got
a lot in common.

1448
01:12:39,589 --> 01:12:40,824
(laughing)

1449
01:12:40,857 --> 01:12:41,858
Oh really?

1450
01:12:42,992 --> 01:12:46,463
What could you two
possibly have in common?

1451
01:12:46,496 --> 01:12:49,499
You just can't kill him, and
I'm gonna leave it at that.

1452
01:12:49,533 --> 01:12:50,434
[Marcel] Why?

1453
01:12:50,467 --> 01:12:51,935
I'm gonna tell you why!

1454
01:12:51,968 --> 01:12:54,704
(dramatic music)

1455
01:13:03,847 --> 01:13:06,082
'Cause it's gonna take
all that you've got

1456
01:13:06,115 --> 01:13:08,518
to stop this boy from
killing your ass,

1457
01:13:08,552 --> 01:13:11,788
and I mean that in
a good Christian way

1458
01:13:13,222 --> 01:13:15,091
especially this one right here.

1459
01:13:15,124 --> 01:13:17,494
Boy, y'all damn
near killed today,

1460
01:13:17,527 --> 01:13:19,028
this man only son.

1461
01:13:21,397 --> 01:13:24,367
He don't talk too
much, but one thing

1462
01:13:24,400 --> 01:13:25,835
we know for sure.

1463
01:13:26,903 --> 01:13:29,272
He ain't too happy.

1464
01:13:29,305 --> 01:13:31,808
(tense music)

1465
01:13:34,644 --> 01:13:36,713
Get him, boy, get him!

1466
01:13:36,746 --> 01:13:37,547
Yeah!

1467
01:13:37,581 --> 01:13:39,182
(tense music)

1468
01:13:39,215 --> 01:13:41,485
(grunting)

1469
01:13:42,486 --> 01:13:43,887
Get him, baby!

1470
01:13:43,920 --> 01:13:45,731
You make sure you make
them pay for what they did

1471
01:13:45,755 --> 01:13:46,755
to our boy.

1472
01:13:47,557 --> 01:13:49,225
(smacking)

1473
01:13:49,258 --> 01:13:51,661
(grunting)

1474
01:13:51,695 --> 01:13:53,930
(smacking)

1475
01:13:56,900 --> 01:13:57,967
You get back here!

1476
01:13:58,001 --> 01:13:59,402
Get him, baby.

1477
01:13:59,435 --> 01:14:02,739
All right Buford, I think
they had about enough.

1478
01:14:02,772 --> 01:14:04,874
Well maybe just a
little bit more.

1479
01:14:04,908 --> 01:14:06,876
(tense music)

1480
01:14:06,910 --> 01:14:09,546
(smacking)

1481
01:14:09,579 --> 01:14:12,081
(tense music)

1482
01:14:13,917 --> 01:14:15,418
Come on Buford, get him.

1483
01:14:15,451 --> 01:14:16,252
Come on Buford, get him.

1484
01:14:16,285 --> 01:14:17,086
Get him, Buford.

1485
01:14:17,120 --> 01:14:18,888
Come on, man.

1486
01:14:18,922 --> 01:14:19,956
Stop, stop.

1487
01:14:21,625 --> 01:14:22,625
Stop!

1488
01:14:25,294 --> 01:14:28,665
Now many years ago, I
tried to keep my boy

1489
01:14:28,698 --> 01:14:32,268
from standing up for
anything that was right.

1490
01:14:32,301 --> 01:14:34,270
I guess I just didn't
think that things

1491
01:14:34,303 --> 01:14:36,873
could ever get
better for Negroes.

1492
01:14:36,906 --> 01:14:41,277
Maybe I didn't want him to
know how proud I was of him.

1493
01:14:41,310 --> 01:14:43,312
So I never said nothing.

1494
01:14:45,081 --> 01:14:47,551
Now that's my grand baby
you know was hurting,

1495
01:14:47,584 --> 01:14:49,919
and he didn't do
nothing but try to walk

1496
01:14:49,953 --> 01:14:51,788
in his daddy's footsteps.

1497
01:14:51,821 --> 01:14:55,992
Now Thomas was the best
employee this factory ever had.

1498
01:14:57,561 --> 01:15:02,265
He told me how he helped build
it up to what it is today.

1499
01:15:02,298 --> 01:15:04,601
I was scared that
y'all'd do to him

1500
01:15:04,634 --> 01:15:06,269
what y'all's doing to Jarvis.

1501
01:15:06,302 --> 01:15:09,739
So I never let him
know that he was good,

1502
01:15:10,640 --> 01:15:12,308
but it was too late.

1503
01:15:13,677 --> 01:15:14,744
He was great.

1504
01:15:16,179 --> 01:15:20,349
He was God's gift to me, his
family, and this factory.

1505
01:15:26,022 --> 01:15:28,491
And, they made us pay for it.

1506
01:15:30,594 --> 01:15:34,764
I lost two people that I
loved behind this foolishness.

1507
01:15:37,200 --> 01:15:41,137
So I know the pain
that she speaks of.

1508
01:15:41,170 --> 01:15:45,341
You see when you've gone
through so much for so long,

1509
01:15:47,210 --> 01:15:51,114
you grab ahold of
anger and bitterness,

1510
01:15:51,147 --> 01:15:55,318
and then it becomes your
friend, and it shields ya.

1511
01:15:56,720 --> 01:16:00,824
It shields ya so that you
don't feel the hurt anymore.

1512
01:16:02,558 --> 01:16:06,229
But, it also keeps the
good from getting in.

1513
01:16:08,197 --> 01:16:12,368
Now here y'all are still
hanging onto the bitterness

1514
01:16:14,137 --> 01:16:15,137
and anger.

1515
01:16:16,505 --> 01:16:19,242
Shame on ya, shame
on all of you.

1516
01:16:24,080 --> 01:16:25,915
You're just like them.

1517
01:16:28,084 --> 01:16:31,520
Now this thing has
got to stop right now.

1518
01:16:34,891 --> 01:16:36,059
She's right.

1519
01:16:37,661 --> 01:16:41,665
Them two were in my
diner earlier today,

1520
01:16:41,698 --> 01:16:45,869
and that man, he asked that
other man to marry his daughter.

1521
01:16:49,605 --> 01:16:52,375
And, I ain't never been
too fond of Negroes,

1522
01:16:52,408 --> 01:16:57,246
but well I figure if he's
good enough for his daughter,

1523
01:16:57,280 --> 01:17:00,416
maybe we oughta give this
idea of us all getting along

1524
01:17:00,449 --> 01:17:01,885
another look.

1525
01:17:01,918 --> 01:17:06,222
So starting tomorrow, y'all
are welcome in my diner.

1526
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:07,390
(clapping)

1527
01:17:07,423 --> 01:17:09,759
[Grandma] Thank you Jesus.

1528
01:17:11,928 --> 01:17:14,630
(dramatic music)

1529
01:17:15,965 --> 01:17:16,966
Daddy, no.

1530
01:17:19,769 --> 01:17:22,205
Mildred, you're not
supposed to be here.

1531
01:17:22,238 --> 01:17:23,072
Go on now.

1532
01:17:23,106 --> 01:17:25,274
Why daddy, why?

1533
01:17:25,308 --> 01:17:27,576
Is it because they look like me?

1534
01:17:27,610 --> 01:17:30,279
Are you ashamed of me, of mommy?

1535
01:17:33,316 --> 01:17:34,784
Well I'll be damned.

1536
01:17:34,818 --> 01:17:37,286
Take her out of here.

1537
01:17:37,320 --> 01:17:38,788
You don't understand.

1538
01:17:38,822 --> 01:17:40,456
That's different.

1539
01:17:40,489 --> 01:17:41,791
I gotta protect what's mine.

1540
01:17:41,825 --> 01:17:44,093
I gotta protect our future.

1541
01:17:45,494 --> 01:17:48,464
That nigger mama of
yours was asking for it.

1542
01:17:48,497 --> 01:17:50,399
You monster!

1543
01:17:50,433 --> 01:17:51,667
She mine now.

1544
01:17:52,769 --> 01:17:55,471
Mildred is mine, Agnes is mine.

1545
01:17:55,504 --> 01:17:59,675
Just like little Cody, I
gotta protect him from y'all.

1546
01:18:03,179 --> 01:18:07,416
I'm just a scared old
Negro from Minden Hall.

1547
01:18:07,450 --> 01:18:11,254
I'm a real bad shot,
and I got terrible aim.

1548
01:18:11,287 --> 01:18:13,489
But, here's what
I got going for me

1549
01:18:13,522 --> 01:18:16,325
at the particular moment.

1550
01:18:16,359 --> 01:18:20,329
I got this big ass gun
to the back of your head

1551
01:18:20,363 --> 01:18:22,866
so I can't miss it if I tried.

1552
01:18:23,967 --> 01:18:25,501
Nigger, you ain't
got it in you.

1553
01:18:25,534 --> 01:18:28,738
Oh, he ain't the one
you got to worry about.

1554
01:18:28,772 --> 01:18:30,940
And, I won't hesitate.

1555
01:18:30,974 --> 01:18:33,743
Just go ahead and try me.

1556
01:18:33,777 --> 01:18:36,312
Y'all can just go to hell.

1557
01:18:36,345 --> 01:18:38,547
(smacking)

1558
01:18:40,616 --> 01:18:44,020
Greg, you know my
gun wasn't even loaded?

1559
01:18:44,053 --> 01:18:46,322
Shit, mine wasn't either.

1560
01:18:47,456 --> 01:18:49,192
But, the ass end
of the snug nose is

1561
01:18:49,225 --> 01:18:50,827
one hit or quit, ain't it?

1562
01:18:50,860 --> 01:18:52,428
I knocked the hell out of that.

1563
01:18:52,461 --> 01:18:53,863
I knocked his monkey ass out.

1564
01:18:53,897 --> 01:18:56,365
(laughing)

1565
01:18:56,399 --> 01:18:58,534
[Sheriff] Let me through.

1566
01:18:58,567 --> 01:19:02,305
Sheriff, these
men are responsible

1567
01:19:02,338 --> 01:19:05,341
for the torture
of this young boy.

1568
01:19:05,374 --> 01:19:08,044
I saw the whole damn
thing, and I wouldn't be

1569
01:19:08,077 --> 01:19:10,513
surprised if they
kidnapped and murdered

1570
01:19:10,546 --> 01:19:13,216
other Negroes in the
surrounding community.

1571
01:19:13,249 --> 01:19:15,518
You willing to
testify to that, sir?

1572
01:19:15,551 --> 01:19:17,887
You damn right I will.

1573
01:19:17,921 --> 01:19:21,324
Long as they keep
making this damn paint.

1574
01:19:22,491 --> 01:19:24,994
[Sheriff] Sir, I don't
think I got your name.

1575
01:19:25,028 --> 01:19:26,262
Dale Stevens.

1576
01:19:27,663 --> 01:19:29,565
That is the weirdest thing.

1577
01:19:29,598 --> 01:19:31,667
There used to be an
old used car salesman

1578
01:19:31,700 --> 01:19:33,636
I used to listen
to when I was a kid

1579
01:19:33,669 --> 01:19:35,704
with that exact same
name, and you sound

1580
01:19:35,738 --> 01:19:38,074
just like him, any relation?

1581
01:19:41,344 --> 01:19:43,079
I never heard of the guy.

1582
01:19:43,112 --> 01:19:45,748
Anyway, you take care, sir.

1583
01:19:45,781 --> 01:19:47,416
You too, sheriff.

1584
01:19:57,626 --> 01:19:59,695
[Mr. Munson] Come on, Jarvis.

1585
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:01,764
Thank you, Mr. Munson.

1586
01:20:01,797 --> 01:20:02,765
Thank you.

1587
01:20:02,798 --> 01:20:05,368
Here let's get
that off of you.

1588
01:20:07,603 --> 01:20:10,773
Well son, Thomas
Cook was your father?

1589
01:20:10,806 --> 01:20:14,277
Yes sir, he taught
me everything I know.

1590
01:20:14,310 --> 01:20:17,113
I haven't heard that
name in almost 20 years

1591
01:20:17,146 --> 01:20:18,681
which is about as
long as he's been

1592
01:20:18,714 --> 01:20:21,450
with the Lord I suppose.

1593
01:20:21,484 --> 01:20:24,287
So many Cooks around here,
I never would've guessed.

1594
01:20:24,320 --> 01:20:27,256
Thomas Cook was not only the
best paper press operator

1595
01:20:27,290 --> 01:20:30,026
I've ever seen, but he was
one of the very best men

1596
01:20:30,059 --> 01:20:31,294
I ever knew.

1597
01:20:31,327 --> 01:20:33,429
Hell he trained me.

1598
01:20:33,462 --> 01:20:36,232
If it wasn't for him, I
wouldn't have had a job.

1599
01:20:36,265 --> 01:20:38,101
I mean that machine
would just stop running

1600
01:20:38,134 --> 01:20:40,870
all of a sudden, and we'd
all be standing around

1601
01:20:40,904 --> 01:20:43,039
scratching our heads
trying to figure it out.

1602
01:20:43,072 --> 01:20:44,607
And, he would just walk up.

1603
01:20:44,640 --> 01:20:46,485
In a matter of seconds, it
was up and running again.

1604
01:20:46,509 --> 01:20:48,044
(laughing)

1605
01:20:48,077 --> 01:20:49,913
When I bought this
company, first thing I said

1606
01:20:49,946 --> 01:20:52,415
I was gonna do was try and
get him that promotion,

1607
01:20:52,448 --> 01:20:54,984
but the law prevented it.

1608
01:20:55,018 --> 01:20:56,628
I don't know how this
company would've made it

1609
01:20:56,652 --> 01:20:59,488
through those early
years without him.

1610
01:20:59,522 --> 01:21:01,790
To tell you the truth, I don't
know how I'll make it now

1611
01:21:01,824 --> 01:21:03,592
without you.

1612
01:21:03,626 --> 01:21:06,996
You've got those
same qualities, son.

1613
01:21:07,030 --> 01:21:11,267
Go home Jarvis, I'll
see you in the morning.

1614
01:21:11,300 --> 01:21:13,136
In the morning, sir?

1615
01:21:14,370 --> 01:21:16,672
What about the second shift?

1616
01:21:16,705 --> 01:21:20,009
I need my new paper press
manager to be well rested.

1617
01:21:20,043 --> 01:21:22,178
He's got a long
day ahead of him.

1618
01:21:22,211 --> 01:21:23,279
(laughing)

1619
01:21:23,312 --> 01:21:24,480
[Jarvis] Yes sir.

1620
01:21:24,513 --> 01:21:26,315
[Mr. Munson]
You bet, good man.

1621
01:21:26,349 --> 01:21:27,316
Yes sir!

1622
01:21:27,350 --> 01:21:30,719
(happy orchestral music)

1623
01:21:55,211 --> 01:21:57,613
[Mr. Spurling] And, all is
well in this little Mississippi

1624
01:21:57,646 --> 01:21:58,881
town.

1625
01:21:58,914 --> 01:22:01,884
Jarvis got his promotion
and lived out a dream

1626
01:22:01,917 --> 01:22:04,320
that his father never could have

1627
01:22:04,353 --> 01:22:07,756
with his best friend
Jericho by his side.

1628
01:22:09,092 --> 01:22:12,461
So grandpa, whatever
happened to those evil men,

1629
01:22:12,495 --> 01:22:14,497
Marcel, Toby, and Larry?

1630
01:22:15,831 --> 01:22:19,668
Well let's just
say they were welcome

1631
01:22:19,702 --> 01:22:23,206
with open arms at their
new place of residence.

1632
01:22:23,239 --> 01:22:25,074
(laughing)

1633
01:22:25,108 --> 01:22:26,909
Fortunately for you
boys, Jim Crow passed

1634
01:22:26,942 --> 01:22:28,544
a little bit too early.

1635
01:22:28,577 --> 01:22:30,679
Governors already mandated
that all jailhouses

1636
01:22:30,713 --> 01:22:31,880
be integrated.

1637
01:22:35,951 --> 01:22:37,720
I just got one question.

1638
01:22:37,753 --> 01:22:39,688
What you in here for?

1639
01:22:42,358 --> 01:22:45,028
(country music)

1640
01:22:48,297 --> 01:22:51,600
And, Jarvis and Jericho
lived happily ever after,

1641
01:22:51,634 --> 01:22:53,102
the end.

1642
01:22:53,136 --> 01:22:57,406
Well now actually, that
was only the beginning.

1643
01:22:57,440 --> 01:23:00,143
(dramatic music)

1644
01:23:18,827 --> 01:23:20,963
Hey Jarvis, everything okay?

1645
01:23:20,996 --> 01:23:23,066
You're usually the
first man here.

1646
01:23:23,099 --> 01:23:26,602
Yes sir, Jericho's
car broke down again.

1647
01:23:28,071 --> 01:23:30,539
But, believe me it was an
easier walk to work today.

1648
01:23:30,573 --> 01:23:32,108
(laughing)

1649
01:23:32,141 --> 01:23:33,452
But hey, I've been
saving for a car

1650
01:23:33,476 --> 01:23:34,953
ever since I got this
job so I won't have

1651
01:23:34,977 --> 01:23:36,612
to worry about that much longer.

1652
01:23:36,645 --> 01:23:39,315
I know that, and I'm
proud of your patience.

1653
01:23:39,348 --> 01:23:41,617
But, I've been thinking
about a way to help you.

1654
01:23:41,650 --> 01:23:43,386
Seeing as I sold the
company last week,

1655
01:23:43,419 --> 01:23:45,321
I'll be retiring soon.

1656
01:23:45,354 --> 01:23:49,192
Well I didn't wait too
much longer to do this.

1657
01:23:52,295 --> 01:23:53,496
What's this, boss?

1658
01:23:53,529 --> 01:23:54,739
That's your new
ride to work, son.

1659
01:23:54,763 --> 01:23:56,732
Got the car at the
house all ready to go.

1660
01:23:56,765 --> 01:23:58,343
You just come on by and
pick it up this afternoon

1661
01:23:58,367 --> 01:23:59,502
after the shift ends.

1662
01:23:59,535 --> 01:24:00,836
Thank you, Mr. Munson.

1663
01:24:00,869 --> 01:24:01,770
Don't mention it.

1664
01:24:01,804 --> 01:24:03,005
Thank you, sir!

1665
01:24:03,038 --> 01:24:05,007
Least I can do for a
hard worker like you.

1666
01:24:05,040 --> 01:24:07,210
Jericho, I got me a car!

1667
01:24:08,977 --> 01:24:10,213
I got me a car!

1668
01:24:14,350 --> 01:24:15,384
Oh my damn.

1669
01:24:18,954 --> 01:24:20,165
Isn't this what you've
been waiting for

1670
01:24:20,189 --> 01:24:21,924
all your damn life?

1671
01:24:21,957 --> 01:24:22,957
Yes.

1672
01:24:25,894 --> 01:24:26,894
My, my, my!

1673
01:24:28,897 --> 01:24:30,299
Do you like it?

1674
01:24:30,333 --> 01:24:31,200
Shit yeah!

1675
01:24:31,234 --> 01:24:33,969
I mean yes sir, we love it.

1676
01:24:34,002 --> 01:24:35,171
Don't we, Jarvis?

1677
01:24:35,204 --> 01:24:36,172
Mr. Munson, it's
the most beautiful car

1678
01:24:36,205 --> 01:24:37,540
I've ever seen.

1679
01:24:37,573 --> 01:24:38,707
I agree.

1680
01:24:38,741 --> 01:24:40,008
I thought you would like it.

1681
01:24:40,042 --> 01:24:42,245
(laughing)

1682
01:24:43,246 --> 01:24:45,114
But, that ain't it.

1683
01:24:45,148 --> 01:24:47,383
Come on, come on over here.

1684
01:24:51,086 --> 01:24:53,189
(crying)

1685
01:24:59,362 --> 01:25:00,639
Well I think y'all
are gonna like this one

1686
01:25:00,663 --> 01:25:02,465
just as well.

1687
01:25:02,498 --> 01:25:04,576
I keep the oil changed, start
it up every now and then,

1688
01:25:04,600 --> 01:25:05,868
but it runs great.

1689
01:25:05,901 --> 01:25:07,503
Been in the family for years.

1690
01:25:07,536 --> 01:25:10,273
(dramatic music)

1691
01:25:19,748 --> 01:25:20,583
(gun firing)

1692
01:25:20,616 --> 01:25:23,586
(glass shattering)

1693
01:25:25,788 --> 01:25:28,391
(yelling)

1694
01:25:28,424 --> 01:25:31,694
Mr. Munson, where'd
you get this car?

1695
01:25:35,063 --> 01:25:38,033
Mr. Munson, I said where
did you get this car?

1696
01:25:38,066 --> 01:25:41,103
Like I said Jarvis, it's
been in the family for years.

1697
01:25:41,136 --> 01:25:42,538
It was my first car.

1698
01:25:42,571 --> 01:25:43,915
Mr. Munson, forgive
me if I don't take

1699
01:25:43,939 --> 01:25:46,375
too kindly to this here gift.

1700
01:25:47,543 --> 01:25:51,046
This car was used in the
murder of my brother,

1701
01:25:51,079 --> 01:25:52,748
my only brother.

1702
01:25:52,781 --> 01:25:56,285
Daddy was never the
same after that night.

1703
01:25:58,487 --> 01:26:01,890
In fact, I don't even
think he smiled again

1704
01:26:01,924 --> 01:26:04,727
even on the happiest of days.

1705
01:26:04,760 --> 01:26:06,629
My brother was my mother
and father's only hope

1706
01:26:06,662 --> 01:26:10,233
to go off to college
and study medicine.

1707
01:26:10,266 --> 01:26:13,336
He was gonna be a
doctor, Mr. Munson.

1708
01:26:14,970 --> 01:26:17,540
I'll never forget
the day we found him

1709
01:26:17,573 --> 01:26:19,475
hanging from that tree.

1710
01:26:21,009 --> 01:26:23,812
I'm so sorry
for your loss son.

1711
01:26:25,248 --> 01:26:27,483
I remember that night also.

1712
01:26:28,984 --> 01:26:31,487
I never thought he would've...

1713
01:26:32,821 --> 01:26:37,125
I never should have
trusted Johnny with my car.

1714
01:26:37,159 --> 01:26:38,159
Johnny?

1715
01:26:39,695 --> 01:26:42,164
You talking about
old man Edwards?

1716
01:26:42,197 --> 01:26:45,968
Yeah unfortunately,
he's my brother-in-law.

1717
01:26:47,303 --> 01:26:49,838
He said he was gonna
celebrate after getting

1718
01:26:49,872 --> 01:26:52,675
that promotion at the mill.

1719
01:26:52,708 --> 01:26:55,110
You know they'd always
despised your father

1720
01:26:55,143 --> 01:26:57,813
for all the good he'd
done around the factory.

1721
01:26:57,846 --> 01:26:59,982
And, he never thought Johnny
deserved that promotion

1722
01:27:00,015 --> 01:27:00,816
over him.

1723
01:27:00,849 --> 01:27:02,351
And, he was right.

1724
01:27:03,886 --> 01:27:06,722
But, when he filed
that complaint,

1725
01:27:10,058 --> 01:27:12,628
he always said he was
gonna teach him a lesson.

1726
01:27:12,661 --> 01:27:13,829
I just shrugged it off.

1727
01:27:13,862 --> 01:27:17,199
I never thought it
would amount to much.

1728
01:27:18,200 --> 01:27:20,369
I guess I'm as much to blame.

1729
01:27:20,403 --> 01:27:23,138
(dramatic music)

1730
01:27:30,879 --> 01:27:32,981
Have you no shame?

1731
01:27:33,015 --> 01:27:35,384
What in God's name
have you done, Johnny?

1732
01:27:35,418 --> 01:27:39,555
What's the matter
there, brother-in-law?

1733
01:27:39,588 --> 01:27:41,557
You ain't never been
out on an evening ride

1734
01:27:41,590 --> 01:27:45,894
with your young'un, had a
deer jump out on you before?

1735
01:27:45,928 --> 01:27:48,864
Marcel, you go inside
and get ready for bed.

1736
01:27:48,897 --> 01:27:49,698
Yes, uncle Clark.

1737
01:27:49,732 --> 01:27:50,733
Right now.

1738
01:27:50,766 --> 01:27:53,402
(dramatic music)

1739
01:27:53,436 --> 01:27:55,804
(laughing)

1740
01:27:55,838 --> 01:27:56,838
Marcel!

1741
01:27:59,408 --> 01:28:02,244
He had an aneurism
later that night.

1742
01:28:02,277 --> 01:28:04,847
He used to have so much to say,

1743
01:28:05,848 --> 01:28:08,584
now he can't say a word.

1744
01:28:08,617 --> 01:28:11,587
Been trapped in a broken
body for 20 years now.

1745
01:28:11,620 --> 01:28:12,688
I'm gonna kill him.

1746
01:28:12,721 --> 01:28:13,556
No, man, no.

1747
01:28:13,589 --> 01:28:14,890
I'm gonna kill him!

1748
01:28:14,923 --> 01:28:16,024
No, Jarvis.

1749
01:28:16,925 --> 01:28:18,927
Jarvis, I know it hurt.

1750
01:28:18,961 --> 01:28:22,998
I know you're upset,
but killing that man

1751
01:28:23,031 --> 01:28:25,868
would be a blessing
to him right now.

1752
01:28:25,901 --> 01:28:28,937
God, done already took
justice out on him

1753
01:28:28,971 --> 01:28:30,773
before he could go to
bed at night and smile

1754
01:28:30,806 --> 01:28:32,307
about what he did.

1755
01:28:33,642 --> 01:28:36,144
Think about what grandma said.

1756
01:28:38,313 --> 01:28:40,349
Jericho's right Jarvis.

1757
01:28:40,383 --> 01:28:44,553
There ain't nothing I can say
to bring your brother back,

1758
01:28:46,288 --> 01:28:48,957
but there is something I can do.

1759
01:28:48,991 --> 01:28:51,494
