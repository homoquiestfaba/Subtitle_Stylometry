1
00:02:01,999 --> 00:02:03,083
Wow.

2
00:02:04,167 --> 00:02:07,212
I can't believe
we're already saying goodbye.

3
00:02:07,295 --> 00:02:11,591
It's been great getting to know you,
Pee-wee Herman.

4
00:02:12,634 --> 00:02:15,178
Earth sure is a great planet.

5
00:02:16,096 --> 00:02:19,432
Your art, music, pizza.

6
00:02:20,726 --> 00:02:23,395
You sure took to our customs fast.

7
00:02:23,478 --> 00:02:25,731
Thanks for showing them to me.

8
00:02:26,815 --> 00:02:29,651
I've loved these last two weeks.

9
00:02:29,735 --> 00:02:32,571
- I wish I didn't have to go.
- [Pee-wee sniffles]

10
00:02:33,864 --> 00:02:34,990
Me, too.

11
00:02:35,699 --> 00:02:38,952
Come with me, back to my planet.

12
00:02:39,036 --> 00:02:41,038
Meet my family and friends.

13
00:02:41,538 --> 00:02:43,874
Live with me.

14
00:02:43,957 --> 00:02:45,291
I can't.

15
00:02:45,375 --> 00:02:48,545
I need to stay here
with the people of Earth.

16
00:02:48,628 --> 00:02:51,840
I'm going to miss my new best friend.

17
00:02:51,924 --> 00:02:56,261
I'll never forget you, Pee-wee.

18
00:02:56,344 --> 00:02:59,389
I'll always remember you, too, Yul.

19
00:03:00,057 --> 00:03:01,767
Look.

20
00:03:01,850 --> 00:03:04,019
I made us both friendship bracelets.

21
00:03:04,103 --> 00:03:05,395
[gasps]

22
00:03:06,605 --> 00:03:09,566
Pee-wee, they're beautiful.

23
00:03:09,649 --> 00:03:11,484
Let's put them on.

24
00:03:19,409 --> 00:03:20,619
[sniffles]

25
00:03:22,871 --> 00:03:24,748
I guess this is...

26
00:03:24,831 --> 00:03:27,626
<i>arrivederci</i> then, right?

27
00:03:28,251 --> 00:03:29,252
Right.

28
00:03:30,003 --> 00:03:33,214
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Pee-wee Herman.

29
00:03:34,049 --> 00:03:36,051
<i>Arrivederci,</i> Yul.

30
00:03:36,135 --> 00:03:37,970
- [spaceship whirring]
- [both gasping]

31
00:03:56,279 --> 00:03:59,074
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

32
00:03:59,158 --> 00:04:02,577
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

33
00:04:03,912 --> 00:04:05,831
I want to go, but I can't leave home!

34
00:04:05,914 --> 00:04:08,291
- I can't leave home! I can't leave home!
- [alarm ringing]

35
00:04:08,374 --> 00:04:09,626
- I can't leave home.
- [ringing continues]

36
00:04:09,709 --> 00:04:13,338
I can't leave home!
I can't leave home!

37
00:04:14,422 --> 00:04:16,716
[chuckles] Morning!

38
00:04:19,052 --> 00:04:20,137
[yelling]

39
00:04:20,220 --> 00:04:21,221
[laughing]

40
00:04:25,934 --> 00:04:27,602
[chuckles] Ooh!

41
00:04:38,905 --> 00:04:40,365
[hissing]

42
00:04:45,996 --> 00:04:47,622
- [deflating]
- [gasps]

43
00:04:50,625 --> 00:04:51,835
[yelling]

44
00:04:54,337 --> 00:04:57,132
[screaming and laughing]

45
00:05:01,053 --> 00:05:02,512
[laughs]

46
00:05:12,480 --> 00:05:13,565
Ooh!

47
00:05:13,648 --> 00:05:14,983
Apple-y! [chuckles]

48
00:05:15,067 --> 00:05:18,361
- Good morning, Pee-wee!
- Morning, Mr. Murgatroyd!

49
00:05:20,864 --> 00:05:21,948
[chuckles]

50
00:05:22,032 --> 00:05:24,243
- [all] Pee-wee!
- Hi, kids! [grunts]

51
00:05:34,169 --> 00:05:36,171
Ooh! Ooh! [chuckles]

52
00:05:41,551 --> 00:05:42,635
[cat meowing]

53
00:05:46,472 --> 00:05:48,016
[barking]

54
00:05:54,856 --> 00:05:56,108
Hello! [chuckles]

55
00:05:57,442 --> 00:05:58,651
[chuckles]

56
00:05:58,735 --> 00:05:59,945
Breakfast bar!

57
00:06:00,028 --> 00:06:02,447
Scone, French toast, American toast...

58
00:06:02,530 --> 00:06:03,698
[sneezes]

59
00:06:03,782 --> 00:06:08,078
Green grapes, sausages,
bacon, cinnamon toast!

60
00:06:10,538 --> 00:06:11,831
Buh-bye!

61
00:06:15,210 --> 00:06:16,377
[screaming]

62
00:06:24,510 --> 00:06:26,221
Good morning, Pee-wee!

63
00:06:28,974 --> 00:06:30,100
[Pee-wee grunts]

64
00:06:31,226 --> 00:06:32,852
Good morning, Mrs. Rose!

65
00:06:32,936 --> 00:06:34,938
[chuckles] Oh, look at you.

66
00:06:35,063 --> 00:06:37,523
You're cute as a peanut!

67
00:06:37,607 --> 00:06:39,484
- Ow!
- [both laughing]

68
00:06:41,320 --> 00:06:43,071
Have you heard about
those new corduroy pillows?

69
00:06:43,155 --> 00:06:45,615
- Corduroy pillows? No.
- [chuckles]

70
00:06:45,698 --> 00:06:48,201
I'm surprised,
'cause they're making head lines!

71
00:06:48,285 --> 00:06:49,452
[laughs]

72
00:06:49,535 --> 00:06:51,371
Get it? "Head lines!"

73
00:06:51,454 --> 00:06:52,872
Oh! [laughs]

74
00:06:53,790 --> 00:06:56,001
- Hold on. Hey, Ruby!
- Morning, Pee-wee.

75
00:06:56,084 --> 00:06:58,962
- Last stop, Nana's Yarn Barn!
- Oh!

76
00:07:00,588 --> 00:07:02,215
[both exclaim]

77
00:07:03,258 --> 00:07:04,634
[both laughing]

78
00:07:05,218 --> 00:07:08,554
You're the sweetest boy in Fairville,
Pee-wee.

79
00:07:08,638 --> 00:07:12,184
- Me?
- Is there anything sweeter than you?

80
00:07:12,267 --> 00:07:15,145
Uh... a Root Beer Barrel?

81
00:07:15,228 --> 00:07:18,273
- That's right!
- [chuckles]

82
00:07:18,357 --> 00:07:21,193
I know they're in here somewhere.

83
00:07:23,111 --> 00:07:24,904
There it is. [gasps]

84
00:07:24,988 --> 00:07:27,157
No.
What was I looking for?

85
00:07:27,240 --> 00:07:29,826
[gasps] Oh...

86
00:07:30,827 --> 00:07:32,871
[laughs]

87
00:07:32,954 --> 00:07:34,664
Root Beer Barrels are my favorite!

88
00:07:36,666 --> 00:07:37,917
Boop! [chuckles]

89
00:07:44,590 --> 00:07:46,009
Ah! [chuckles]

90
00:07:46,676 --> 00:07:49,929
Well, listen, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run.

91
00:07:50,013 --> 00:07:52,432
- Bye, Mrs. Rose!
- Bye-bye, Pee-wee.

92
00:07:52,515 --> 00:07:54,059
[laughing]

93
00:07:54,142 --> 00:07:55,185
[horn honking]

94
00:07:55,268 --> 00:07:57,812
- Pee-wee!
- Yo, Billy!

95
00:07:59,064 --> 00:08:01,524
- Hey, Pee-wee!
- Hey, Ben!

96
00:08:02,234 --> 00:08:05,486
- Morning, Pee-wee!
- Kevin!

97
00:08:05,570 --> 00:08:07,947
- [chuckles]
- Pee-wee!

98
00:08:08,031 --> 00:08:09,574
I'm so glad I bumped into you.

99
00:08:09,657 --> 00:08:11,910
I've got an amazing deal
I want to tell you about.

100
00:08:11,993 --> 00:08:13,578
You're gonna have to tell me later, Marvin.

101
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,996
I'm on my way to work. [chuckles]

102
00:08:15,080 --> 00:08:18,333
Just a moment of your time.
Come on, Pee-wee.

103
00:08:19,334 --> 00:08:23,129
Tell me, Pee-wee, where do you
picture yourself on vacation?

104
00:08:23,213 --> 00:08:24,714
Mexico?

105
00:08:24,797 --> 00:08:26,132
Or Morocco?

106
00:08:26,216 --> 00:08:27,800
Mexico?

107
00:08:27,884 --> 00:08:29,677
Morocco?

108
00:08:29,761 --> 00:08:32,805
What is this?
A travel agency or a millinery?

109
00:08:32,889 --> 00:08:36,142
Sorry, Marvin, I'm not interested.

110
00:08:36,226 --> 00:08:37,352
[stutters] Come on, Pee-wee.

111
00:08:37,436 --> 00:08:38,853
Don't you ever wonder

112
00:08:38,937 --> 00:08:41,647
- what life is like outside Fairville?
- Nope!

113
00:08:42,774 --> 00:08:46,319
Marvin, you know I don't want
to go anywhere or try anything new.

114
00:08:46,403 --> 00:08:47,487
Bye! [chuckles]

115
00:08:59,874 --> 00:09:01,209
[chuckles]

116
00:09:05,422 --> 00:09:06,881
[chuckles] Phew!

117
00:09:06,965 --> 00:09:08,925
[screams]

118
00:09:09,008 --> 00:09:12,095
Emily, you scared me there for a moment.

119
00:09:12,929 --> 00:09:14,597
I know I have overdue books.

120
00:09:14,680 --> 00:09:16,557
I'm gonna return them soon, I promise.

121
00:09:16,641 --> 00:09:19,144
- I don't care about silly overdue books.
- Oh?

122
00:09:19,227 --> 00:09:22,230
But I do have something special
I wanted to give to you.

123
00:09:22,314 --> 00:09:23,648
[chuckles]

124
00:09:23,731 --> 00:09:25,066
Hmm.

125
00:09:26,859 --> 00:09:29,321
[Pee-wee gasps] The new <i>Scuba Cop?</i>

126
00:09:29,404 --> 00:09:30,863
<i>The Emerald Sharks?</i>

127
00:09:30,947 --> 00:09:33,616
And the sharks are hammerheads?

128
00:09:33,699 --> 00:09:36,619
These are the exact type of sharks
that Scuba Cop hates the most!

129
00:09:36,702 --> 00:09:40,332
I haven't received your RSVP
for the Book Club tomorrow night.

130
00:09:40,415 --> 00:09:42,375
I was thinking that, maybe afterwards,
you and I might...

131
00:09:42,459 --> 00:09:45,295
Whoa, whoa!
Emily, let me stop you right there.

132
00:09:45,378 --> 00:09:47,005
The fact is...

133
00:09:47,088 --> 00:09:49,424
I neglected to RSVP my regrets.

134
00:09:49,508 --> 00:09:51,801
I have rehearsal that night. NA.

135
00:09:51,884 --> 00:09:54,471
- NA?
- Not available.

136
00:09:54,554 --> 00:09:55,555
- Sorry.
- [chuckles]

137
00:09:55,638 --> 00:09:57,390
Well, what time is your rehearsal?

138
00:09:57,474 --> 00:09:59,100
Oh, uh, TBD.

139
00:09:59,184 --> 00:10:01,727
- TBD?
- To be decided.

140
00:10:02,895 --> 00:10:05,940
LATT, Em. IHTBG.

141
00:10:06,024 --> 00:10:09,944
- [chuckles] What?
- LATT, IHTBG.

142
00:10:10,028 --> 00:10:11,488
- IHT...
- "Look at the time."

143
00:10:11,571 --> 00:10:13,573
"I have to be going."

144
00:10:13,656 --> 00:10:15,616
You understand.

145
00:10:17,952 --> 00:10:18,953
[horn honking]

146
00:10:20,163 --> 00:10:22,081
Yay! Work time!

147
00:10:22,165 --> 00:10:24,000
[chuckles]

148
00:10:24,083 --> 00:10:25,751
[indistinct chatter]

149
00:10:28,254 --> 00:10:32,509
Two eggs, fried, extra hash browns,
side of sausage. Enjoy!

150
00:10:32,592 --> 00:10:35,387
Looks fantastic as always, Beverly.

151
00:10:35,470 --> 00:10:36,596
[phone ringing]

152
00:10:36,679 --> 00:10:39,474
Dan's Diner.
Dan speaking.

153
00:10:39,558 --> 00:10:41,351
[humming]

154
00:10:42,435 --> 00:10:43,811
[chuckles]

155
00:10:49,568 --> 00:10:51,611
- French toast is up, Bev!
- [bell dings]

156
00:10:52,820 --> 00:10:54,739
Denver omelet.
Easy on the cheese.

157
00:10:54,822 --> 00:10:57,534
Easy on the cheese-y, coming right up-y!

158
00:11:00,161 --> 00:11:01,829
Boop. [chuckles]

159
00:11:03,873 --> 00:11:07,293
Dudley! Sylvester! Clovis!
What are you guys doing here?

160
00:11:07,377 --> 00:11:10,088
Pee-wee, we need to talk to you
about band rehearsal.

161
00:11:10,171 --> 00:11:13,758
Well, it is unusual to be discussing
Renegades business at my workplace,

162
00:11:13,841 --> 00:11:15,009
but, sure, what's up?

163
00:11:15,093 --> 00:11:18,638
My promotion at the grocery store means
I'm gonna be working a lot more hours.

164
00:11:18,721 --> 00:11:20,139
Nights.

165
00:11:20,223 --> 00:11:23,851
Yeah, and my girlfriend's making me take
ballroom dancing with her

166
00:11:23,935 --> 00:11:25,562
four times a week.

167
00:11:25,645 --> 00:11:26,729
Nights.

168
00:11:26,812 --> 00:11:30,275
My office just pressured me into joining
their nighttime bowling league.

169
00:11:30,358 --> 00:11:31,401
Nights.

170
00:11:31,484 --> 00:11:33,986
But the Renegades rehearse at night.

171
00:11:34,070 --> 00:11:37,156
Hello? How's that gonna work
if all you guys are so busy at night?

172
00:11:37,240 --> 00:11:38,408
It's not.

173
00:11:38,491 --> 00:11:40,452
The Renegades are breaking up.

174
00:11:41,411 --> 00:11:42,495
What?

175
00:11:43,996 --> 00:11:45,831
- No!
- Things are changing.

176
00:11:45,915 --> 00:11:48,460
None of us have enough time
to be in a band anymore.

177
00:11:48,543 --> 00:11:49,544
I do!

178
00:11:49,628 --> 00:11:51,421
That's because you're stuck in a rut,
Pee-wee.

179
00:11:51,504 --> 00:11:53,047
We want to move on to other things.

180
00:11:53,131 --> 00:11:55,007
What am I supposed to move on to?

181
00:11:55,091 --> 00:11:57,009
What am I supposed to do
with my flutophone?

182
00:11:57,093 --> 00:11:58,928
Why don't you think about a solo career?

183
00:11:59,011 --> 00:12:00,721
Why don't you?

184
00:12:11,190 --> 00:12:12,400
[Pee-wee] Good luck, you guys.

185
00:12:13,192 --> 00:12:17,280
Good luck with all your stupid, important
reasons for breaking up the Renegades!

186
00:12:17,363 --> 00:12:18,698
[all sighing]

187
00:12:21,618 --> 00:12:22,952
[grunting]

188
00:12:28,458 --> 00:12:30,042

190
00:12:41,387 --> 00:12:43,598
- Nice seeing you, Dan.
- Bye, Dan!

191
00:12:44,724 --> 00:12:48,102
Pee-wee, I gotta say,
your French toast is perfection!

192
00:12:48,186 --> 00:12:49,312
Thanks.

193
00:12:49,395 --> 00:12:53,232
Same with your pancakes, Herman.
They drive me crazy!

194
00:12:53,316 --> 00:12:55,443
Not that long a drive, Ernie, but thanks.

195
00:12:55,527 --> 00:12:57,945
I'm taking this biscuit with me.

196
00:12:58,029 --> 00:12:59,030
I love it.

197
00:12:59,113 --> 00:13:00,699
- Why don't you marry it?
- [all laugh]

198
00:13:00,781 --> 00:13:04,327
Listen, you guys, you seem really busy.
Let me let you let me run, okay?

199
00:13:04,410 --> 00:13:05,828
All right? Buh-bye!

200
00:13:05,911 --> 00:13:06,996
- Thanks for coming.
- Later!

201
00:13:07,079 --> 00:13:08,540
- See you tomorrow.
- Bye.

202
00:13:08,623 --> 00:13:12,001
Hey, sport, can you watch over the diner?

203
00:13:12,084 --> 00:13:14,295
I gotta go meet a couple pals at the lodge.

204
00:13:14,379 --> 00:13:17,632
Sure, Dan. I'll be right here.
Where else would I go?

205
00:13:17,716 --> 00:13:20,259
Gonna be right here.
Just like always.

206
00:13:21,469 --> 00:13:22,762
Have fun with your pals!

207
00:13:22,845 --> 00:13:24,889
[laughs] Attaboy!

208
00:13:34,566 --> 00:13:36,150
[clattering]

209
00:13:44,743 --> 00:13:46,411
[crying]

210
00:13:48,663 --> 00:13:51,207
[tears sizzling]

211
00:13:59,257 --> 00:14:01,426
Sharks pulling off a jewel heist?
[chuckles]

212
00:14:01,509 --> 00:14:02,802
It could happen,

213
00:14:02,885 --> 00:14:06,097
but not if Scuba Cop happens to be
swimming around! [laughs]

214
00:14:06,180 --> 00:14:07,682
[motorcycle engine revving]

215
00:14:22,029 --> 00:14:24,574
[soul music playing]

216
00:14:24,657 --> 00:14:26,200
Cool.

217
00:14:26,826 --> 00:14:28,035
[rock music playing]

218
00:14:29,412 --> 00:14:30,871
Double cool.

219
00:14:31,956 --> 00:14:34,459
[songs mash up]

220
00:14:35,293 --> 00:14:36,628
Triple cool.

221
00:14:40,423 --> 00:14:42,341
Uh, hi! What can I get you?

222
00:14:42,425 --> 00:14:44,761
- Milkshake, please.
- Flavor?

223
00:14:46,387 --> 00:14:47,555
Let's say chocolate.

224
00:14:47,639 --> 00:14:49,265
Sure. Three, two, one.

225
00:14:49,348 --> 00:14:51,851
- [both] Chocolate.
- [chuckles]

226
00:15:01,193 --> 00:15:02,695
[Pee-wee humming]

227
00:15:05,698 --> 00:15:07,492
Boop! [chuckles]

228
00:15:07,575 --> 00:15:09,744
[humming]

229
00:15:09,828 --> 00:15:11,245
Ooh! [chuckles]

230
00:15:16,668 --> 00:15:19,211
Ooh! [chuckles]

231
00:15:19,295 --> 00:15:21,255
[continues humming]

232
00:15:23,382 --> 00:15:26,302
La, la, la, la, la, la, la.

233
00:15:26,385 --> 00:15:28,220
La! [chuckles]

234
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:38,397

[mimics retching]

236
00:15:50,951 --> 00:15:51,952
[chuckles]

237
00:16:05,591 --> 00:16:07,426
Boop! Think fast!

238
00:16:17,520 --> 00:16:18,979
Wow!

239
00:16:19,063 --> 00:16:21,023
Thanks, appreciate that.

240
00:16:21,106 --> 00:16:22,483
[grunts]

241
00:16:24,151 --> 00:16:25,194
Mmm.

242
00:16:29,031 --> 00:16:30,115
Mmm!

243
00:16:31,116 --> 00:16:32,159
Mmm!

244
00:16:33,953 --> 00:16:36,497
[exclaiming]

245
00:16:36,581 --> 00:16:38,791
Wow, man!

246
00:16:38,875 --> 00:16:40,877
This milkshake is outrageous.

247
00:16:40,960 --> 00:16:42,879
I really mean it.
Probably... [inhales]

248
00:16:42,962 --> 00:16:44,296
top five, all-time.

249
00:16:44,380 --> 00:16:46,841
[chuckles] Thanks, my specialty.

250
00:16:46,925 --> 00:16:48,968
You know what would go great
with a milkshake of this caliber?

251
00:16:49,051 --> 00:16:50,261
[both] A Root Beer Barrel!

252
00:16:51,888 --> 00:16:54,599
[both] Only the best candy in the world!

253
00:16:54,682 --> 00:16:55,725
[both] It really is!

254
00:16:55,808 --> 00:16:57,184
[both] Distant second?

255
00:16:57,268 --> 00:16:59,854
[both] Charleston Chew. Third?

256
00:16:59,979 --> 00:17:01,564
[both] Tie between two candies.

257
00:17:01,647 --> 00:17:02,690
[both] Rolos and Skittles!

258
00:17:02,774 --> 00:17:03,900
[both] Shut up!

259
00:17:03,983 --> 00:17:05,484
[both] Shut up!

260
00:17:05,568 --> 00:17:07,027
[both] Shut up.

261
00:17:10,656 --> 00:17:12,742
Well, all right,
Mr. Master Milkshake Maker,

262
00:17:12,825 --> 00:17:14,744
what do you say you show me around
this little burg of yours?

263
00:17:14,827 --> 00:17:18,205
Me? A tour of Fairville?
I'd love to!

264
00:17:18,289 --> 00:17:20,959
Oh, I can't.
I gotta watch over the diner.

265
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,252
- I promised Dan and Beverly...
- "Promised Dan and Beverly"?

266
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:26,005
Will you listen to yourself?
You sound like a little baby.

267
00:17:26,088 --> 00:17:28,048
We'll only be gone ten minutes.

268
00:17:28,132 --> 00:17:30,676
Chillax, man.
Live a little.

269
00:17:30,760 --> 00:17:32,261
What?

270
00:17:34,513 --> 00:17:35,514
Live a little.

271
00:17:37,099 --> 00:17:38,601
[whispers] Live a little.

272
00:17:42,814 --> 00:17:44,356
[chuckles]

273
00:17:44,440 --> 00:17:45,817
[motorcycle engine idling]

274
00:17:50,404 --> 00:17:52,865
I have kind of limited experience
on a motorcycle.

275
00:17:52,949 --> 00:17:54,241
Shh!

276
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:57,912
- You hear that?
- What?

277
00:17:57,996 --> 00:18:01,332
It's the old highway callin'.
Get on.

278
00:18:01,415 --> 00:18:03,542
[chuckles]

279
00:18:06,545 --> 00:18:08,172
[engine revving]

280
00:18:12,635 --> 00:18:14,512
[Pee-wee laughing]

281
00:18:22,186 --> 00:18:24,063
- Wicked-awesome view, dude!
- [chuckles]

282
00:18:24,146 --> 00:18:27,358
- And it's right in your backyard.
- I'm glad you like it.

283
00:18:27,441 --> 00:18:31,195
It roughly corresponds
to the model scale HO-187.

284
00:18:31,278 --> 00:18:33,155
Wow, this is a whole new world for me.

285
00:18:33,238 --> 00:18:35,074
A miniature world!

286
00:18:35,157 --> 00:18:36,283
[both laughing]

287
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:38,661
A miniature world.

288
00:18:38,744 --> 00:18:41,998
I mean, look at the detail.
It's breathtaking.

289
00:18:42,081 --> 00:18:43,875
You got a real gift, man.

290
00:18:43,958 --> 00:18:45,001
Thank you.

291
00:18:45,084 --> 00:18:47,712
Hey, how about that tour of Fairville?

292
00:18:48,796 --> 00:18:52,257
Right over there, that's Dan's Diner,
where we met.

293
00:18:52,341 --> 00:18:55,427
And there, Fairville Public Library.

294
00:18:55,511 --> 00:18:57,096
Fairville High.

295
00:18:57,179 --> 00:18:59,098
Tire Repair of Fairville.

296
00:18:59,181 --> 00:19:00,892
Fairville Fire Department.

297
00:19:00,975 --> 00:19:02,309
Barber of Fairville.

298
00:19:02,393 --> 00:19:03,644
And this right here,

299
00:19:03,728 --> 00:19:07,523
this little building is where Fairville's
premier music group, the Renega...

300
00:19:08,566 --> 00:19:11,485
- What's wrong? What's that building?
- Nothing.

301
00:19:12,194 --> 00:19:13,821
It's just some stupid building

302
00:19:13,905 --> 00:19:17,282
where my stupid band used to rehearse
before we broke up!

303
00:19:17,366 --> 00:19:18,951
Let me get that right out of there.

304
00:19:20,119 --> 00:19:22,788
[Pee-wee grunts]
Stupid! Stupid!

305
00:19:24,373 --> 00:19:25,457
[yelling]

306
00:19:25,541 --> 00:19:27,459
[yelling continues]

307
00:19:29,670 --> 00:19:30,671
You okay?

308
00:19:30,755 --> 00:19:33,091
Yeah, sure. I'm fine. [chuckles]

309
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:35,843
Hey! What's that?

310
00:19:36,761 --> 00:19:38,888
[chuckles] Is that your house?

311
00:19:39,680 --> 00:19:41,640
I didn't notice you had a tree house.

312
00:19:41,724 --> 00:19:42,725
Oh, I don't.

313
00:19:42,808 --> 00:19:45,853
That's the only detail
of this entire model that doesn't exist...

314
00:19:45,937 --> 00:19:46,896
yet.

315
00:19:46,979 --> 00:19:48,522
- [both laugh]
- That's funny.

316
00:19:48,606 --> 00:19:50,524
You know, I always wanted
a tree house, too.

317
00:19:50,608 --> 00:19:52,317
That is funny!

318
00:19:52,401 --> 00:19:53,903
[both laughing]

319
00:19:55,113 --> 00:19:56,114
Say...

320
00:19:57,364 --> 00:19:59,742
What do you say you and me
get a picture of us

321
00:19:59,825 --> 00:20:01,619
at the site of your future tree house?

322
00:20:01,702 --> 00:20:05,039
You ready?
Three, two, one.

323
00:20:05,123 --> 00:20:06,791
- [both] Root Beer Barrels!
- [shutter clicking]

324
00:20:09,585 --> 00:20:11,211
You know, I never caught your name.

325
00:20:11,295 --> 00:20:14,673
Oh, it's Pee-wee. Pee-wee Herman.
And you are?

326
00:20:14,757 --> 00:20:16,759
[laughs] Good one.

327
00:20:17,468 --> 00:20:18,886
Uh... what?

328
00:20:20,345 --> 00:20:21,973
Wait...

329
00:20:22,056 --> 00:20:23,182
you don't know who I am?

330
00:20:23,265 --> 00:20:25,309
How could I?
Why would I?

331
00:20:25,392 --> 00:20:27,145
I'm Joe...

332
00:20:27,227 --> 00:20:28,312
Manganiello.

333
00:20:28,437 --> 00:20:30,898
Well, pleasure to meet you,
Joe Man... [mumbling]

334
00:20:30,982 --> 00:20:32,650
Manganiello.

335
00:20:32,733 --> 00:20:34,276
Sorry, trick ear.
One more time.

336
00:20:34,359 --> 00:20:35,569
Manganiello.

337
00:20:37,613 --> 00:20:38,781
I'm an actor.

338
00:20:38,864 --> 00:20:41,533
I'm told show business
can be very competitive,

339
00:20:41,617 --> 00:20:44,536
so hang on to your dreams
and who knows? [chuckles]

340
00:20:44,620 --> 00:20:46,413
I wish you luck, Joe Man... [mumbling]

341
00:20:46,497 --> 00:20:49,458
- Certainly you've heard of <i>True Blood?</i>
- Uh-uh.

342
00:20:50,209 --> 00:20:52,962
<i>- Magic Mike?</i>
- Hmm, you'd think so, but no.

343
00:20:53,545 --> 00:20:54,964
Man, you're so real.

344
00:20:55,047 --> 00:20:56,924
That's what I like about you, Pee-wee.
You're normal.

345
00:20:57,008 --> 00:20:58,342
- [chuckles]
- [laughs]

346
00:20:58,425 --> 00:21:00,845
[exclaims]
Your miniature world is awesome.

347
00:21:03,222 --> 00:21:05,516
Hey, what's on the other side
of those railroad tracks?

348
00:21:05,599 --> 00:21:06,976
Beyond Fairville?

349
00:21:07,059 --> 00:21:09,145
I don't know, I've never been there.

350
00:21:09,228 --> 00:21:10,188
Never?

351
00:21:11,856 --> 00:21:13,983
May I tell you something
I've never told anyone?

352
00:21:15,442 --> 00:21:16,527
Sure.

353
00:21:16,610 --> 00:21:17,653
What is it?

354
00:21:18,362 --> 00:21:20,280
Once upon a time, I won a contest.

355
00:21:20,364 --> 00:21:23,075
A trip to Salt Lake City, Utah.

356
00:21:23,159 --> 00:21:24,785
- [fanfare]
- [kids exclaiming]

357
00:21:24,869 --> 00:21:27,412
- But I never made it to Salt Lake City.
- [tires squealing]

358
00:21:27,496 --> 00:21:29,456
- Or Utah.
- [car crashing]

359
00:21:29,540 --> 00:21:32,126
- Long story short...
- [faint sirens wailing and gunfire]

360
00:21:32,210 --> 00:21:34,628
I came back with a metal plate in my head.

361
00:21:34,712 --> 00:21:35,921
- [metal clinking]
- [EKG flatlining]

362
00:21:37,006 --> 00:21:39,967
That explains why you don't travel.
[sighs] Hmm...

363
00:21:40,885 --> 00:21:43,387
[stutters] Do you ever get worried
that life's just passing you by?

364
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:44,763
Ha!

365
00:21:44,847 --> 00:21:48,350
What could possibly be going on out there
that I haven't tried already in Fairville?

366
00:21:48,433 --> 00:21:50,728
- You ever been in a fight?
- No.

367
00:21:51,436 --> 00:21:53,605
- You ever broken a rule?
- No!

368
00:21:53,689 --> 00:21:55,107
You ever had two women fight over you?

369
00:21:55,191 --> 00:21:56,358
Uh...

370
00:21:56,441 --> 00:21:57,902
Have I? No.

371
00:21:58,819 --> 00:22:02,489
Breaking rules and breaking hearts,
that's what life's all about.

372
00:22:02,573 --> 00:22:04,075
I believe in fate.

373
00:22:04,158 --> 00:22:05,784
And I think I know why you and I met.

374
00:22:08,120 --> 00:22:10,455
You're gonna leave Fairville...

375
00:22:10,539 --> 00:22:12,875
and you're gonna take a holiday.

376
00:22:12,958 --> 00:22:14,877
I got your reason right here.

377
00:22:14,960 --> 00:22:17,171
What is it? What?

378
00:22:22,009 --> 00:22:23,886
I want you to be at my birthday party.

379
00:22:25,554 --> 00:22:27,056
New York City! [chuckles]

380
00:22:27,139 --> 00:22:28,348
How would I ever...

381
00:22:28,432 --> 00:22:31,102
[stammering] I couldn't possibly...

382
00:22:31,185 --> 00:22:33,187
This is all happening so fast.

383
00:22:33,312 --> 00:22:34,980
See you in five days, brother.

384
00:22:35,106 --> 00:22:37,524
"Five days"?
"Brother"?

385
00:22:37,608 --> 00:22:40,194
- I've never even been on an airplane.
- No!

386
00:22:40,278 --> 00:22:42,362
The only thing you're gonna
learn about yourself on a plane

387
00:22:42,446 --> 00:22:46,117
is that you like the honey-roasted peanuts
better than the plain-salted.

388
00:22:46,867 --> 00:22:48,535
If you're really hungry,

389
00:22:48,619 --> 00:22:51,289
the open road is a smorgasbord
of life experience.

390
00:22:51,872 --> 00:22:56,294
A few days on the open road
is worth a lifetime in Fairville.

391
00:22:56,376 --> 00:22:57,962
The way I see it, Pee-wee Herman,

392
00:22:58,045 --> 00:23:00,672
you got a choice to make.

393
00:23:00,756 --> 00:23:02,424
Stick around here...

394
00:23:04,009 --> 00:23:05,177
[engine starting]

395
00:23:05,261 --> 00:23:07,346
...or live a little.

397

or live a little.

399
00:23:18,774 --> 00:23:19,942
What should I do?

400
00:23:20,985 --> 00:23:22,903
I wish I had some kind of sign.

401
00:23:25,739 --> 00:23:28,200
Whoa, that's a big apple.

402
00:23:29,285 --> 00:23:30,577
Big Apple!

403
00:23:30,661 --> 00:23:32,454
That's it! Bingo!

404
00:23:33,705 --> 00:23:35,916
- Can I get anybody more water?
- Where's my order?

405
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:37,417
Where's the food?

406
00:23:37,501 --> 00:23:38,669
I'm starving!

407
00:23:38,752 --> 00:23:41,339
Bev, my lunch break is practically over!

408
00:23:41,421 --> 00:23:43,799
- Me hungry!
- [thudding]

409
00:23:44,758 --> 00:23:47,594
Shoot! Heck! Darn!

410
00:23:50,722 --> 00:23:52,391
Pee-wee, where have you been?

411
00:23:53,351 --> 00:23:54,352
I'm leaving town.

412
00:23:55,686 --> 00:23:59,190
I won't be at work tomorrow
or the next day or the day after that.

413
00:24:01,066 --> 00:24:02,776
I'm taking a holiday.

Nope.

Come on, let me go.

00:27:39,951 --> 00:27:42,746
I gotta get to New York City,
to my friend's birthday party.

I don't care if your friend
is the Queen of England

100th birthday party

Maybe we can trust him.

No way!
He'll go and squeal to the cops.

00:31:17,628 --> 00:31:20,422
There's a bag of groceries on your roof!

537
00:31:22,006 --> 00:31:24,635
[laughing]

538
00:31:24,718 --> 00:31:25,927
[Pee-wee] Gotcha!

[both laughing]

540
00:31:29,097 --> 00:31:30,307
Bingo.

541
00:31:32,934 --> 00:31:35,895
Ew! Snake farm, yuck.

542
00:31:35,979 --> 00:31:38,106
Ugh, I hate snakes.

543
00:31:38,189 --> 00:31:41,401
One of the area's
most popular attractions!

544
00:31:41,485 --> 00:31:44,112
And, it just so happens, our next stop.

545
00:31:44,738 --> 00:31:47,574
I supply their gift shop. [chuckles]

546
00:31:48,617 --> 00:31:49,618
These...

547
00:31:50,577 --> 00:31:52,579
are what I call "the classics."

548
00:31:52,663 --> 00:31:54,665
- The big-sellers.
- [gasps]

549
00:31:54,748 --> 00:31:58,877
You're looking at some of the most
sought-after retail items in the world.

550
00:31:59,503 --> 00:32:02,547
- [chuckles]
- Please do not touch the merchandise,

551
00:32:02,631 --> 00:32:04,633
however tempted you may be.

552
00:32:04,716 --> 00:32:07,385
- I won't, I promise.
- Okay.

553
00:32:07,469 --> 00:32:09,220
- Hey, what's that over there?
- Hmm?

554
00:32:11,682 --> 00:32:13,517
[rustling]

555
00:32:15,894 --> 00:32:17,979
I think that's a...

556
00:32:18,062 --> 00:32:19,815
- tumbleweed.
- Oh!

557
00:32:19,898 --> 00:32:21,566
- Forgot that word.
- [both laughing]

558
00:32:22,776 --> 00:32:24,319
Ooh, pecan logs.

559
00:32:24,402 --> 00:32:25,904
- Mmm!
- [laughing]

560
00:32:25,987 --> 00:32:27,238
Here.

561
00:32:27,322 --> 00:32:31,284
A solar-powered calculator
the size of a business card.

562
00:32:31,368 --> 00:32:32,536
- [gasps]
- Complimentary.

563
00:32:32,619 --> 00:32:33,829
Ooh, thanks.

564
00:32:34,746 --> 00:32:38,124
Want anything else?
I'm feeling generous.

565
00:32:40,001 --> 00:32:42,504
Top Secret Disguise Kit?

566
00:32:42,587 --> 00:32:44,172
Wise choice!

567
00:32:44,255 --> 00:32:46,049
It's yours.

568
00:32:46,132 --> 00:32:48,051
You never know when
you're gonna need one of those.

569
00:32:50,178 --> 00:32:53,557
- [speaking Spanish]
- [laughs]

570
00:32:58,937 --> 00:33:01,231
[speaking Spanish]

571
00:33:02,148 --> 00:33:04,150
Ah, they sell themselves.

572
00:33:06,236 --> 00:33:08,029
Ew! Snake farm.

573
00:33:08,112 --> 00:33:10,657
Yuck. Ugh!

574
00:33:10,741 --> 00:33:12,450
Have I mentioned I hate snakes?

575
00:33:12,534 --> 00:33:13,952
Ah, Pee-wee.

576
00:33:47,068 --> 00:33:49,696
[speaking Spanish]

577
00:33:52,449 --> 00:33:55,076

579
00:34:01,040 --> 00:34:04,878
[muttering in Spanish]

580
00:34:10,008 --> 00:34:11,342
[screaming]

581
00:34:12,803 --> 00:34:13,845
Blech!

582
00:34:13,929 --> 00:34:15,054
Yuck.

583
00:34:15,138 --> 00:34:16,723
Ugh!

584
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:24,689
- I think I'll just wait out here.
- [laughs]

585
00:34:24,773 --> 00:34:25,983
Come on.

586
00:34:26,024 --> 00:34:30,278
By the time we leave this place,
I bet you'll be a snake lover, Pee-wee.

587
00:34:30,361 --> 00:34:31,613
Bet me!

588
00:34:31,696 --> 00:34:32,948
Come on.

589
00:34:34,699 --> 00:34:40,413
Baby rattlers are the most dangerous,
because their venom is the strongest.

590
00:34:49,464 --> 00:34:51,591
- That's stupid.
- [laughs]

591
00:34:51,675 --> 00:34:55,178
Come on, I can't wait
for you to see this place.

592
00:34:55,261 --> 00:34:58,181
They got a snake in here
as big as that bus.

593
00:35:00,017 --> 00:35:04,270
Clay and Jimmy, behold the Cuatro Fuego.

594
00:35:05,188 --> 00:35:09,192
Light four flames at the same time.

595
00:35:11,695 --> 00:35:13,237
- [exclaiming]
- [laughing]

596
00:35:13,321 --> 00:35:15,239
What do you think, honey?

597
00:35:15,323 --> 00:35:16,449
We'll take four boxes.

598
00:35:17,241 --> 00:35:18,702
- Deal.
- Deal.

599
00:35:18,785 --> 00:35:19,995
[both laughing]

600
00:35:35,176 --> 00:35:36,177
Lame.

601
00:35:37,261 --> 00:35:38,346
Yawn.

602
00:35:38,429 --> 00:35:39,472
Stupid.

603
00:35:39,556 --> 00:35:42,934
It was a pleasure doing
business with you, as always.

604
00:35:43,894 --> 00:35:46,063
How you liking the Snake Farm, Pee-wee?

605
00:35:46,145 --> 00:35:47,898
I thought it would be a little scarier.

606
00:35:47,981 --> 00:35:49,649
You want scary, huh?

607
00:35:50,650 --> 00:35:53,486
If you're really looking to see
something scary...

608
00:35:53,570 --> 00:35:55,655
who's he gotta see, Jimmy?

609
00:35:55,739 --> 00:35:57,240
The Monster.

610
00:35:58,575 --> 00:36:00,702
That is, if you're brave enough.

611
00:36:00,785 --> 00:36:02,662
I think I could handle it.

612
00:36:02,746 --> 00:36:04,288
Well, let's go.

613
00:36:11,046 --> 00:36:13,673

Now, initial here.

And here.

629
00:37:00,804 --> 00:37:01,888
Okay, I'm ready.

630

[gasps]

633
00:37:30,249 --> 00:37:31,501
[sighs]

634
00:37:31,584 --> 00:37:33,128
That's it?

635
00:37:33,211 --> 00:37:34,754
Rip-off.

636
00:37:34,838 --> 00:37:36,339

[shuddering] Uh-oh.

642
00:38:28,183 --> 00:38:29,642
Getting dark.

[distant wolf howling]

644
00:38:32,812 --> 00:38:38,442
Sure would be nice
to see some sort of sign of civilizat...

[gasps] Jackpot! [chuckles]

Hello, there.

00:38:49,662 --> 00:38:51,706
Sorry, I don't mean to trespass.

Trespass? [chuckles]

649
00:38:53,624 --> 00:38:56,753
No such thing in the heartland, stranger.

650
00:38:56,836 --> 00:38:59,422
They call me Farmer Brown.

They call me Pee-wee Herman.
Pleased to meet you.

652

What brings you to my farm, Pee-wee?

00:39:04,468 --> 00:39:05,553
Well...

654
00:39:05,636 --> 00:39:07,222
Say no more.

655
00:39:07,305 --> 00:39:09,807
You've got yourself a place to stay.

656
00:39:09,891 --> 00:39:11,684
Thanks, Mr. Br...

Oh, sure.

Oh, congratulations.

756

Who's your lucky new son-in-law?

Well, he's riding in the truck with me.

758
00:45:02,743 --> 00:45:04,120

What about Pam?

766

Excuse the intrusion
to this most joyous occasion.

801
00:47:24,719 --> 00:47:28,389

- Nay!
- [girls giggling]

Best friends since beauty school.

818
00:48:22,652 --> 00:48:24,320

00:48:24,403 --> 00:48:25,404
- Okay.
- You tell him.

820
00:48:25,488 --> 00:48:27,948
What about you, Wanda?
How'd you get involved?

821
00:48:28,031 --> 00:48:29,533
I had the bus.

822

[all laughing]

823
00:48:31,661 --> 00:48:33,203
And look at us all now.

Demo.

830
00:48:48,302 --> 00:48:52,973
My friends, let's show Pee-wee
what's definitely gonna make us win.

831
00:48:57,770 --> 00:48:59,062
[Pee-wee] Ooh, wow!

00:48:59,146 --> 00:49:00,939
Hairy. Whoa! [chuckles]

833
00:49:01,023 --> 00:49:02,024
Big.

834
00:49:02,107 --> 00:49:04,193
Who doesn't like giant hair?

835
00:49:04,276 --> 00:49:06,320
You haven't even heard our theme.

Wow!

840
00:49:26,089 --> 00:49:28,175
It's way bigger than I thought.

841
00:49:29,009 --> 00:49:30,511
I'm not gonna make it.

842
00:49:30,594 --> 00:49:32,596
The party's in two days.

843
00:49:32,680 --> 00:49:34,640
Look where I am.

844
00:49:34,724 --> 00:49:36,684
Look where I need to be.

845
00:49:37,351 --> 00:49:38,561
I won't get there in time.

846
00:49:38,644 --> 00:49:40,979
What's wrong, baby?

847
00:49:41,063 --> 00:49:43,691
I might as well give up
and go back to Fairville.

848
00:49:45,609 --> 00:49:48,487
My friend won't even notice
I'm not at his party.

849
00:49:48,571 --> 00:49:50,030
Oh, I bet he will.

850
00:49:50,113 --> 00:49:52,991
I would notice if Brook or Lane or Wanda
didn't show up to my party.

851
00:49:53,075 --> 00:49:54,535
[Brook] Pee-wee,

Ooh, probably.

Come over here.

1248
01:12:37,146 --> 01:12:39,565
What could be keeping him
from the party of the century?

1249
01:12:42,401 --> 01:12:44,320
Where are you, Pee-wee?

1250
01:12:44,403 --> 01:12:46,655
- [knock on door]
- Come in.

1251
01:12:52,703 --> 01:12:54,956
Pee-wee's never gonna make it.

1252
01:12:55,039 --> 01:12:56,332
It's okay, there's still time.

1253
01:12:56,415 --> 01:12:58,334
The party's only been going on
for a couple of hours.

1254
01:12:58,417 --> 01:12:59,961
Nah, I know him.

1255
01:13:00,044 --> 01:13:01,921
If he was coming, he'd be here already.

1256
01:13:03,339 --> 01:13:06,008
[sighs] Why wouldn't he come?

1257
01:13:07,927 --> 01:13:09,595
Did I do something wrong, Shelly?

1258
01:13:09,678 --> 01:13:11,430
Of course not.

1259
01:13:11,513 --> 01:13:15,268
Inviting him to a party cross-country,
I mean, who does that?

1260
01:13:15,351 --> 01:13:17,061
I should've known better.

1261
01:13:17,145 --> 01:13:20,148
Stupid Joe.
Stupid, stupid Joe.

1262
01:13:20,231 --> 01:13:22,650
[softly] I'm gonna let you
have some space.

1263
01:13:26,195 --> 01:13:27,404
[door closes]

1264
01:13:39,875 --> 01:13:41,877
Pee-wee, where are you?

1265
01:13:44,797 --> 01:13:46,174
Well, well, well.

1266
01:13:46,257 --> 01:13:49,635
I'm trapped in a well.
Halfway to hell.

1267
01:13:49,718 --> 01:13:52,680
I sure hope I don't crack up down here.

1268
01:13:52,763 --> 01:13:54,431
Uh-oh! Too late!

1269
01:13:54,515 --> 01:13:55,641
[cackling]

1270
01:14:04,733 --> 01:14:06,694
Mr. Lincoln, what are you doing here?

1271
01:14:06,777 --> 01:14:09,280
I am here to tell you
something very important.

1272
01:14:09,364 --> 01:14:11,240
Always eat your vegetables.

1273
01:14:11,324 --> 01:14:12,491
I hate vegetables!

1274
01:14:12,574 --> 01:14:13,659
Eat those Brussels sprouts!

1275
01:14:13,742 --> 01:14:15,161
- [gasps]
- I command you.

1276
01:14:15,244 --> 01:14:17,579
I am the President of the United States.

1277
01:14:22,543 --> 01:14:23,711
Your Majesty.

1278
01:14:23,794 --> 01:14:25,963
Don't you "Your Majesty" me.

1279
01:14:26,047 --> 01:14:29,508
Do you happen to know,
has the hamburger train arrived yet?

1280
01:14:29,591 --> 01:14:31,719
[sighs] Why don't you look
at the schedule?

1281
01:14:31,802 --> 01:14:34,138
- Why don't you?
- [both chuckle]

1282
01:14:35,264 --> 01:14:37,892
We suspect that you've stolen
the palace jewels.

1283
01:14:38,017 --> 01:14:39,727
Where are they?
Hand them over.

1284
01:14:39,810 --> 01:14:43,105
I don't know what you're talking about.
I've never seen those jewels.

1285
01:14:43,189 --> 01:14:44,690
Uh-oh.

1286
01:14:44,773 --> 01:14:46,692
My last match.

1287
01:14:47,735 --> 01:14:50,529
[high-pitched screaming]

1288
01:14:50,612 --> 01:14:52,114
Shut up, you little baby!

1289
01:14:52,198 --> 01:14:54,283
It doesn't matter
if you make it to the party.

1290
01:14:54,367 --> 01:14:57,161
- Joe won't even notice you're not there.
- Yes, he will.

1291
01:14:57,245 --> 01:14:59,496
You're a nobody.
From Nowhere-ville.

1292
01:14:59,580 --> 01:15:00,831
It's Fairville.

1293
01:15:00,915 --> 01:15:02,875
Nobody will notice or care!

1294
01:15:02,958 --> 01:15:05,753
Not Joe, not Fairville...

1295
01:15:05,836 --> 01:15:08,381
Not nobody.
You'll never get out of here.

1296
01:15:08,464 --> 01:15:09,965
[cackling]

1297
01:15:10,049 --> 01:15:12,634
Help! Help! Help!

1298
01:15:13,469 --> 01:15:14,803
- [in distance] Help!
- Hold on...

1299
01:15:14,887 --> 01:15:16,847
- Help!
- Do you hear that?

1300
01:15:16,931 --> 01:15:18,766
[cartoon music playing on TV]

1301
01:15:19,934 --> 01:15:23,687
<i>I'm here live in Central Park,
where a boy has fallen down a well.</i>

1302
01:15:23,771 --> 01:15:25,773
<i>Paramedics have just arrived on the scene.</i>

1303
01:15:25,856 --> 01:15:28,443
<i>Due to safety concerns and restrictions,
a rescue team...</i>

1304
01:15:28,525 --> 01:15:30,278
Now you're in bed?

1305
01:15:30,361 --> 01:15:31,862
It's my party, Shelly.

1306
01:15:31,946 --> 01:15:33,572
Your guests are asking where you are.

1307
01:15:33,655 --> 01:15:36,367
Some of them have traveled half-way
around the world to be here.

1308
01:15:36,451 --> 01:15:40,455
There is only one person that I wanted
to show up to my party and he didn't.

1309
01:15:41,372 --> 01:15:43,916
I know that you're upset about Pee-wee,

1310
01:15:43,999 --> 01:15:47,211
but why don't you come downstairs,
open some presents?

1311
01:15:47,295 --> 01:15:49,464
Venus and Serena are here.

1312
01:15:50,465 --> 01:15:51,966
Elton.

1313
01:15:52,883 --> 01:15:55,552
No, I'm just gonna stay here.

1314
01:15:56,471 --> 01:15:59,723
Okay, I'll tell everyone
that you aren't ready yet.

1315
01:16:06,563 --> 01:16:10,318
<i>When he was asked if he needed anything,
the boy requested, quote,</i>

1316
01:16:10,401 --> 01:16:14,405
<i>"Root Beer Barrels.
A lot of Root Beer Barrels, please."</i>

1317
01:16:14,489 --> 01:16:16,615
<i>- And a search is underway...</i>
- Root Beer Barrels?

1318
01:16:16,698 --> 01:16:18,826
<i>...at this very moment,
for those Root Beer Barrels.</i>

1319
01:16:18,909 --> 01:16:21,662
<i>Reporting live from Central Park,
I'm Julie Andrews.</i>

1320
01:16:21,745 --> 01:16:23,205
Central Park!

1321
01:16:25,500 --> 01:16:28,503
- [helicopter whirring]
- [sirens blaring]

1322
01:16:30,587 --> 01:16:34,091
Hold on, Pee-wee.
Joe Manganiello to your rescue.

1323
01:16:37,052 --> 01:16:38,220
[whirring]

1324
01:16:50,525 --> 01:16:52,568
May my hand be steady.

1325
01:16:55,696 --> 01:16:57,072
Bull's-eye.

1326
01:16:59,783 --> 01:17:02,744
Here I come, Pee-wee!

1327
01:17:12,004 --> 01:17:13,088
Captain Jones.

1328
01:17:14,089 --> 01:17:15,299
Good evening.

1329
01:17:16,384 --> 01:17:17,593
Joe Manganiello?

1330
01:17:17,676 --> 01:17:19,636
- What are you...
- The boy trapped down the well.

1331
01:17:19,720 --> 01:17:21,263
What's his name?

1332
01:17:21,347 --> 01:17:23,516
Well, Mr. Manganiello,
I can't give that information.

1333
01:17:23,599 --> 01:17:27,353
Captain... is his name Pee-wee Herman?

1334
01:17:27,436 --> 01:17:29,230
Well, yeah.

1335
01:17:29,313 --> 01:17:31,524
Yes, it is.
How'd you know?

1336
01:17:32,567 --> 01:17:34,318
He's my friend.

1337
01:17:34,402 --> 01:17:36,945
- Now, what's the plan on getting him out?
- Well...

1338
01:17:37,946 --> 01:17:41,325
<i>And we have just received the name
of the boy who fell down the well,</i>

1339
01:17:41,409 --> 01:17:42,577
<i>Pee-wee Herman.</i>

1340
01:17:43,702 --> 01:17:46,663
Shut up, everybody!
We know this guy.

1341
01:17:47,664 --> 01:17:49,083
Turn up the volume, Tugboat!

1342
01:17:50,125 --> 01:17:52,127
Pee-wee?

1343
01:17:52,211 --> 01:17:53,588
You know Pee-wee?

1344
01:17:54,589 --> 01:17:55,964
You know Pee-wee?

1345
01:17:57,550 --> 01:17:58,800
Quiet down, everybody!

1346
01:18:00,135 --> 01:18:02,597
Pee-wee's in trouble.

1347
01:18:03,639 --> 01:18:04,681
Pee-wee!

1348
01:18:05,600 --> 01:18:06,559
Joe!

1349
01:18:08,185 --> 01:18:09,520
Welcome to New York.

1350
01:18:09,604 --> 01:18:11,939
Happy birthday, Joe.

1351
01:18:12,022 --> 01:18:13,524
I fell down a well.

1352
01:18:14,442 --> 01:18:15,443
Yeah, I heard.

1353
01:18:16,444 --> 01:18:17,778
How are things going down there?

1354
01:18:17,861 --> 01:18:20,864
Great! Really good.
I'll be right up!

1355
01:18:20,948 --> 01:18:22,199
- [chuckles]
- Actually, Pee-wee,

1356
01:18:22,283 --> 01:18:25,286
I was just informed that,
for safety reasons...

1357
01:18:26,287 --> 01:18:29,081
they won't be able to get you
out of this well for another two days.

1358
01:18:29,164 --> 01:18:30,374
Oh...

1359
01:18:31,500 --> 01:18:33,877
So, I guess I'll be...

1360
01:18:33,961 --> 01:18:36,380
Missing my party, yeah.

1361
01:18:36,464 --> 01:18:38,424
[sobbing]

1362
01:18:38,507 --> 01:18:40,635
I did everything you said, Joe!

1363
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:43,095
I broke rules, I broke hearts.

1364
01:18:43,178 --> 01:18:44,346
I lived a little.

1365
01:18:44,430 --> 01:18:48,434
I wanted to find out who I was.
Well, I found out, all right!

1366
01:18:48,517 --> 01:18:52,813
I'm a stupid little baby
crying at the bottom of this crappy well!

1367
01:18:52,938 --> 01:18:55,149
[sobbing]

1368
01:18:55,232 --> 01:18:57,610
Come on, Pee-wee.
You can do it.

1369
01:18:57,693 --> 01:18:59,612
They'll get you out, sport.

1370
01:18:59,695 --> 01:19:02,490
You probably didn't even notice
I wasn't at your party!

1371
01:19:02,573 --> 01:19:03,949
Are you kidding?

1372
01:19:05,075 --> 01:19:07,828
Pee-wee, can I tell you something?

1373
01:19:10,498 --> 01:19:12,749
Ten minutes ago,
I was bawling my eyes out.

1374
01:19:12,833 --> 01:19:14,627
You were? Why?

1375
01:19:14,710 --> 01:19:16,128
Because...

1376
01:19:17,254 --> 01:19:19,298
I thought you weren't coming to my party.

1377
01:19:19,756 --> 01:19:21,300
[sniffles] Really?

1378
01:19:21,842 --> 01:19:23,135
Mmm-hmm.

1379
01:19:23,218 --> 01:19:24,970
[sobbing]

1380
01:19:25,053 --> 01:19:27,848
I'm getting you out of here, Pee-wee.
Just hang on.

1381
01:19:27,931 --> 01:19:29,183
I'll be right back.

1382
01:19:29,266 --> 01:19:30,434
- Captain...
- Yeah.

1383
01:19:30,518 --> 01:19:33,228
I can't wait two days.
I need Pee-wee out of that well now.

1384
01:19:33,312 --> 01:19:34,605
No, it's too dangerous.

1385
01:19:34,689 --> 01:19:36,315
Gotta make sure the well
doesn't collapse on him.

1386
01:19:36,398 --> 01:19:37,650
Collapse on him?

1387
01:19:37,733 --> 01:19:39,860
Darn it, Captain, how could
something like this even happen?

1388
01:19:39,943 --> 01:19:42,070
Why wasn't there something
covering the well?

1389
01:19:42,154 --> 01:19:44,448
You're right, Mr. Manganiello.
That's the problem.

1390
01:19:44,532 --> 01:19:47,368
This metal plate should've
been covering the well.

1391
01:19:49,537 --> 01:19:50,954
Metal plate?

1392
01:19:52,581 --> 01:19:53,790
Wait...

1393
01:19:54,916 --> 01:19:55,917
I've got it.

1394
01:19:58,295 --> 01:20:00,255
- Heads up, Pee-wee!
- [gasps]

1395
01:20:06,428 --> 01:20:07,429

My God!

1400
01:20:20,735 --> 01:20:22,236
- Come on.
- Come on.

1401
01:20:22,319 --> 01:20:24,446
- Just a little further!
- [Pee-wee] My brain!

[groaning]

1403
01:20:33,581 --> 01:20:34,790
I gotcha!

1405
01:20:36,667 --> 01:20:37,834

[straining] Come on!

1407
01:20:40,295 --> 01:20:42,130
- Joe!
- Pee-wee!

1408
01:20:42,214 --> 01:20:43,507
Happy birthday!

What do you say we get to my party?

1412
01:20:58,647 --> 01:20:59,898
What party?

1413
01:20:59,981 --> 01:21:01,483
[both laughing]

1414
01:21:13,078 --> 01:21:15,790
Wait, I thought you lived
in the penthouse.

1415
01:21:15,872 --> 01:21:17,416
Oh, I do.

1416
01:21:17,499 --> 01:21:19,334
Aren't we going to your party?

1417
01:21:19,418 --> 01:21:21,378
Pee-wee, we are the party.

1418

[elevator bell dings]

01:21:28,844 --> 01:21:31,346
[gasps] Holy fudge!

1420
01:21:31,430 --> 01:21:34,683
- A giant miniature world!
- [Joe] Yep!

1421
01:21:34,767 --> 01:21:36,852
A giant miniature world.

1422
01:21:36,935 --> 01:21:40,230
I made it all myself.
From my imagination.

1423
01:21:41,273 --> 01:21:43,400
[Pee-wee] Dinosaur world!

1424
01:21:43,484 --> 01:21:46,069
- Cool volcano!
- [Joe] That lava's cotton candy.

1425
01:21:47,112 --> 01:21:50,324
Hey, you and I hit it off
the minute we met, remember?

1426
01:21:50,407 --> 01:21:52,075
[chuckles]

1427
01:21:52,159 --> 01:21:53,285
You inspired me.

1428
01:21:54,578 --> 01:21:57,665
This is Glitter Mountain. Look!
I covered it with pixies.

1429
01:21:58,582 --> 01:22:00,083
[train horn tooting]

1430
01:22:01,084 --> 01:22:03,003
- [gasps]
- Oh, hey, looky here.

1431
01:22:04,254 --> 01:22:07,215
Wow! You even have Fairville!

1432
01:22:07,299 --> 01:22:09,677
Dan's Diner.
The town square.

1433
01:22:09,760 --> 01:22:11,595
[gasps] My house!

1434
01:22:11,679 --> 01:22:16,933
[gasps] Look, a miniature of my miniature!

1435
01:22:17,017 --> 01:22:19,102
I knew you'd notice that. [chuckles]

1436
01:22:19,186 --> 01:22:21,563
And... the best part.

1437
01:22:23,482 --> 01:22:24,608
[gasps]

1438
01:22:34,326 --> 01:22:35,828
My tree house!

1439
01:22:39,373 --> 01:22:41,249
Look, Joe.

1440
01:22:41,333 --> 01:22:43,502
I made this present for you.

1441
01:22:45,796 --> 01:22:47,339
Happy birthday.

1442
01:22:47,422 --> 01:22:49,633
A friendship bracelet.

1443
01:22:49,717 --> 01:22:50,843
Right.

1444
01:22:57,558 --> 01:22:58,684
And look.

1445
01:23:00,143 --> 01:23:01,353
[chuckles] It's just like mine!

1446
01:23:01,436 --> 01:23:03,438
- Yeah!
- [both laughing]

1447
01:23:06,400 --> 01:23:08,903
- You know what would make this perfect?
- Yep.

1448
01:23:16,117 --> 01:23:17,118
Boop!

1449
01:23:18,286 --> 01:23:19,287
Boop!

1450
01:23:22,040 --> 01:23:23,584
- [both] To friendship.
- [clinks]

1451
01:23:30,048 --> 01:23:31,425
[both] Ah!

1452
01:23:31,508 --> 01:23:33,343
[both laughing]

1453
01:23:47,566 --> 01:23:48,776
Here you go, fellas.

1454
01:23:48,859 --> 01:23:50,527
- Thanks, Bev. Yum!
- Thanks, Bev.

1455
01:23:51,528 --> 01:23:53,113
What's this stuff on my plate?

1456
01:23:53,196 --> 01:23:54,907
Look, it's on my plate, too.

1457
01:23:54,990 --> 01:23:57,952
Let's ask the chef.
Hey, Pee-wee!

1458
01:23:58,034 --> 01:23:59,202
Yes, Beverly?

1459
01:23:59,286 --> 01:24:01,872
What is this on these gentlemen's plates?

1460
01:24:01,956 --> 01:24:03,999
- Fish sticks.
- No, there.

1461
01:24:04,082 --> 01:24:06,042
- Oh. You mean the garnish.
- Garnish?

1462
01:24:06,126 --> 01:24:08,128
Yes, garnish.

1463
01:24:08,211 --> 01:24:13,008
A decoration or embellishment
of a prepared food-plate or drink

1464
01:24:13,091 --> 01:24:15,260
to augment the visual impact on the plate.

1465
01:24:15,343 --> 01:24:16,386
Can you eat it?

1466
01:24:16,470 --> 01:24:18,138
My garnish tastes like an orange.

1467
01:24:18,221 --> 01:24:19,306
It is an orange.

1468
01:24:19,389 --> 01:24:21,057
[Beverly] Yes, your meal
will come with garnish.

1469
01:24:21,141 --> 01:24:22,434
Welcome back, Pee-wee!

1470
01:24:22,517 --> 01:24:25,312
I can't put my finger on it, but there's
something different about you.

1471
01:24:25,395 --> 01:24:27,522
[Emily] He's worldly now.
Right, Pee-wee?

1472
01:24:27,606 --> 01:24:28,983
[Renegades] Pee-wee!

1473
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,693
Pee-wee, why don't you stop by
and jam with us tonight?

1474
01:24:31,777 --> 01:24:33,487
Why don't you?

1475
01:24:33,570 --> 01:24:35,823
- This adding machine... hmm?
- Dan, check this out.

1476
01:24:35,906 --> 01:24:37,866
Solar-powered calculator.

1477
01:24:37,950 --> 01:24:38,951
Solar?

1478
01:24:39,034 --> 01:24:40,911
Yep, from the Latin, <i>solaris,</i>

1479
01:24:40,995 --> 01:24:44,498
meaning, "Derives its power
from the sun or <i>sol."</i>

1480
01:24:44,581 --> 01:24:45,582
Hmm?

1481
01:24:46,583 --> 01:24:49,044
[chuckles] It works!

1482
01:24:49,127 --> 01:24:52,006
And this thing is just the size
of a business card!

1483
01:24:52,088 --> 01:24:53,548
Ain't that a miracle?

1484
01:24:53,632 --> 01:24:54,591
[chuckles]

1485
01:25:01,682 --> 01:25:03,350
[motorcycle engine revving]

1486
01:25:26,498 --> 01:25:27,875
[Pee-wee exclaims]

1487
01:25:29,250 --> 01:25:30,669
[Pee-wee laughs]

1488
01:25:33,755 --> 01:25:34,756
[Pee-wee chuckles]
