Patch me through to

Go ahead, 40 Victor-One.

22
00:04:21,985 --> 00:04:23,642
- I think I found your man.

23
00:04:24,505 --> 00:04:26,507
- [Crime Watch] You sure?

24
00:04:26,507 --> 00:04:27,681
- Yes, sir.

25
00:04:28,854 --> 00:04:30,891
I got me a major
 most wanted here.

26
00:04:32,306 --> 00:04:36,655
Only he don't look much like
 a dangerous killer, presently.

32

Would you mind putting
 that crap back in the bag?

33
00:05:16,005 --> 00:05:17,213
It's still evidence.

34
00:05:34,264 --> 00:05:35,818

- You think we can get
 through this today?

38
00:05:46,276 --> 00:05:47,243
- You got a date?

39
00:05:51,109 --> 00:05:52,938
Your name is Nicholas
 Isidore Augustine,

40
00:05:52,938 --> 00:05:54,871
AKA Nicholas August?

41
00:05:54,871 --> 00:05:56,356
- Yeah.

42
00:05:56,356 --> 00:05:58,150
- And you waived the right
 to have an attorney present.

43
00:05:58,150 --> 00:05:59,013
Is that correct?

44
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,153
- My attorney is present.

45
00:06:04,364 --> 00:06:05,295
- Let's get to it.

46
00:06:06,435 --> 00:06:09,817
I'm Special Agent
 Winslow of the FBI,

47
00:06:10,991 --> 00:06:12,855
Organized Crime Division.

48
00:06:15,271 --> 00:06:17,100
I'm confused about one
 thing, your residence.

49
00:06:17,100 --> 00:06:20,897
Are you are living in Los
 Angeles or Palm Springs?

50
00:06:20,897 --> 00:06:23,141
- You seem to have all
 the information today.

51
00:06:24,245 --> 00:06:26,075
Why don't you tell me?

52
00:06:29,181 --> 00:06:30,666
- You know something?

53
00:06:30,666 --> 00:06:32,978
I'm sure that that wit got
 you by in Baker and Colgate

54
00:06:32,978 --> 00:06:37,431
and Virginia Law, but it just
 doesn't cut it down here.

55
00:06:38,605 --> 00:06:39,537
You know what I mean?

56
00:06:39,537 --> 00:06:40,607
Let's not go down that path.

57
00:06:42,022 --> 00:06:44,921
And if you're so goddamn smart,
what are you doing in here?

58
00:06:47,855 --> 00:06:52,860
Look, before we get started,
 you want like a soda?

59
00:06:53,343 --> 00:06:54,517
Coffee?

60
00:06:54,517 --> 00:06:56,968
Here, look, have a cigarette.

61
00:06:56,968 --> 00:06:57,969
[pack thuds]

62
00:06:57,969 --> 00:06:58,797
Relax.

[Nick sighs]

64
00:07:02,180 --> 00:07:04,009
- Yeah, that's how I
 used to do it, too.

65
00:07:07,910 --> 00:07:09,429
- Excuse me?

66
00:07:09,429 --> 00:07:11,258
- Look, let's just cut
 the bullshit, okay?

67
00:07:11,258 --> 00:07:13,260
You know who you're talking to.

68
00:07:15,435 --> 00:07:16,470
See, the first
 thing I used to do

69
00:07:16,470 --> 00:07:17,989
is get the relationship going,

70
00:07:19,369 --> 00:07:20,854
establish some contact.

71
00:07:21,682 --> 00:07:22,994
Care for a cigarette?

82
00:07:51,712 --> 00:07:52,817
- Nice serve.

83
00:07:54,784 --> 00:07:56,821
So, when were you
 gonna tell me, pal?

84
00:07:56,821 --> 00:07:57,994
- Tell you what?

85
00:07:57,994 --> 00:07:59,651
- That you're getting
 kicked upstairs.

86
00:07:59,651 --> 00:08:00,583
- I'm not going anywhere.

87
00:08:00,583 --> 00:08:01,826
Serve the ball, let's go.

88
00:08:01,826 --> 00:08:03,137
- Deputy Attorney
 General's office

89
00:08:03,137 --> 00:08:05,277
ordered a job eval
 on you, buddy.

90
00:08:05,277 --> 00:08:07,487
I smell justice.

92
00:08:19,119 --> 00:08:20,430
Yep.

93
00:08:20,430 --> 00:08:21,535
Lousy back hand.

94
00:08:22,847 --> 00:08:24,573
- I'm trying to concentrate
 here, do you mind?

95
00:08:24,573 --> 00:08:25,505
Thank you.

96
00:08:25,505 --> 00:08:26,920
- There's rumblings going around

97
00:08:26,920 --> 00:08:28,680
that Federal's putting together
a new team of hot shots

98
00:08:28,680 --> 00:08:30,510
to work in organized crimes.

99
00:08:30,510 --> 00:08:31,752
- Who told you that?

100
00:08:31,752 --> 00:08:32,581
- Serve.

101
00:08:34,824 --> 00:08:37,517
[ball bouncing]

102
00:08:40,036 --> 00:08:43,281
I gotta tell ya,
 I'm pretty jealous.

103
00:08:43,281 --> 00:08:45,283
They must want you
 pretty bad, too.

104
00:08:45,283 --> 00:08:48,735
Your background check
 alone was this thick.

105
00:08:53,705 --> 00:08:56,225
- What's the score?
 - Nine all.

106

[Anson sighs]

110
00:09:10,204 --> 00:09:12,068
Organized crimes
 has been monitoring

111
00:09:12,068 --> 00:09:15,347
a new undercurrent of
 hostility in the mob of late.

112
00:09:15,347 --> 00:09:17,108
- I thought the families
went legit years ago.

113
00:09:17,108 --> 00:09:18,972
- Well, they have
 and they haven't.

114
00:09:18,972 --> 00:09:20,974
I mean, one thing's for certain,

115
00:09:20,974 --> 00:09:23,804
the mafia certainly has
 assimilated into society.

116
00:09:24,943 --> 00:09:26,220
Hell, you can't
 buy a glass of beer

117
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:27,532
or a gallon of gas
 without the mafia

118
00:09:27,532 --> 00:09:29,292
getting a kickback
somewhere down the line.

119
00:09:29,292 --> 00:09:30,949
- So, why are they still
 warring with each other then?

120
00:09:30,949 --> 00:09:31,778
- They're not.

121
00:09:33,124 --> 00:09:35,091
Somebody from the outside
 is coming at them.

122
00:09:35,091 --> 00:09:36,023
- Who?

123
00:09:36,023 --> 00:09:36,886
- Well, who do you think?

124
00:09:38,336 --> 00:09:40,407
The guys that picked up
 what the mob left behind.

125
00:09:41,822 --> 00:09:43,652
The next generation
 of immigrants?

126
00:09:44,929 --> 00:09:46,206
The Chinese?

127
00:09:47,517 --> 00:09:50,590
I mean, the Triads are
 all fleeing Hong Kong.

128
00:09:50,590 --> 00:09:52,212
I guess they figure it's
easier to come over here

129
00:09:52,212 --> 00:09:54,973
and take on our
criminal justice system.

130
00:09:54,973 --> 00:09:56,423
- Yeah, well, I don't see it.

131
00:09:56,423 --> 00:09:58,011
- Yeah, but these
 are smart guys.

132
00:09:58,011 --> 00:10:00,220
I mean, they kept chipping
 away, chipping away

133
00:10:00,220 --> 00:10:03,430
until they found somebody that
 could open up the back door.

134
00:10:03,430 --> 00:10:06,019
Somebody who will let 'em
 in, make some introductions.

135
00:10:06,019 --> 00:10:07,986
They settled on this
 mid-level hood from Jersey

136
00:10:07,986 --> 00:10:10,126
who just got relocated out West.

137
00:10:10,126 --> 00:10:12,750
Guy got a little too
 ambitious for his own good.

138
00:10:12,750 --> 00:10:13,923
You know, the Triads are wining

139
00:10:13,923 --> 00:10:15,615
and dining the hell out of him.

140
00:10:15,615 --> 00:10:18,410
He's gonna be their entree
 into the power base,

141
00:10:18,410 --> 00:10:20,792
setting him up with his
own little organization.

142
00:10:22,000 --> 00:10:24,554
Organized Crimes calls
 him the Toy Godfather.

143
00:10:24,554 --> 00:10:26,626
He's got like his own
 little empire already.

144
00:10:28,006 --> 00:10:29,318
I don't know, maybe
 you've heard of this guy.

145
00:10:29,318 --> 00:10:30,802
Carlo Augustine.

146
00:10:30,802 --> 00:10:33,702
[soft piano music]

147
00:10:44,816 --> 00:10:46,266
Nick, you okay?

148
00:10:50,097 --> 00:10:51,271
You all right, man?

149
00:10:51,271 --> 00:10:52,410
- Yeah, yeah, I'm fine.

150
00:10:53,514 --> 00:10:54,757
I'm fine.

151
00:10:54,757 --> 00:10:57,657
- Anyway, this guy came
up through the ranks.

152
00:10:57,657 --> 00:10:59,797
He has some lineage.

153
00:10:59,797 --> 00:11:01,833
His father was
 Armando Augustine.

154
00:11:03,283 --> 00:11:04,525
I mean, to the mafia families,

155
00:11:04,525 --> 00:11:07,252
this guy was il
 capo di tutti capi.

156
00:11:07,252 --> 00:11:09,047
The godfather.

157
00:11:10,428 --> 00:11:11,947
He was a tough old bastard too.

158
00:11:13,258 --> 00:11:14,743
I think it was back in the '60s

159
00:11:14,743 --> 00:11:16,641
when one of his
 paisans took him out.

160
00:11:18,194 --> 00:11:20,990
The hit wiped out the whole
family except for the two kids.

161
00:11:20,990 --> 00:11:22,336
Two sons.

162
00:11:22,336 --> 00:11:23,683
Carlo was the oldest.

163
00:11:25,132 --> 00:11:27,687
Now the Triads are setting
 him up out here, out West,

164
00:11:27,687 --> 00:11:29,723
down out of Palm Springs.

165
00:11:29,723 --> 00:11:31,242
- What happened
 to the other boy?

166
00:11:31,242 --> 00:11:34,728
- Oh yeah, well, he was just
 a little kid at the time.

167
00:11:34,728 --> 00:11:36,661
Nobody really knows
 what happened to him.

 Hi, leave a message

181
00:12:31,371 --> 00:12:33,200

00:12:36,583 --> 00:12:39,034
Come on, bud, I
 know you're there.

185
00:12:39,034 --> 00:12:40,760
Pick up or I'm
 sending a squad car.

186
00:12:42,762 --> 00:12:44,556
All right, I'm giving
 you a three-count.

187
00:12:44,556 --> 00:12:46,179
One, two.

188
00:12:48,112 --> 00:12:49,596
- Hi, Mom.

189
00:12:49,596 --> 00:12:51,563
- [Anson] You okay, bub?

190
00:12:51,563 --> 00:12:52,806
- I'm fine.

191
00:12:52,806 --> 00:12:54,635
I guess I just must
 be a little burnt out.

192
00:12:54,635 --> 00:12:55,947
- [Anson] Can't handle
 the pressure, huh?

193
00:12:55,947 --> 00:12:57,328
I always knew you were soft.

194
00:12:58,812 --> 00:13:01,608
My top boy goes AWOL, I'm
 going berserk around here.

195
00:13:01,608 --> 00:13:03,783
Seriously though, I was
 getting a little worried.

196
00:13:03,783 --> 00:13:05,957
- Hey, I'm sorry about
that, Ans, I really am.

197
00:13:05,957 --> 00:13:10,306
- [Anson] Look, you want
 some R & R, you got it, bub.

198
00:13:10,306 --> 00:13:13,137
God knows you put in more
 time than any five of my DAs.

199
00:13:13,137 --> 00:13:15,518
You got enough sick
time and vacation leave

200
00:13:15,518 --> 00:13:16,865
coming to cruise for a while.

201
00:13:16,865 --> 00:13:18,798
- Great, that
 sounds good, thanks.

202
00:13:18,798 --> 00:13:19,937
- [Anson] Anyway.

203
00:13:19,937 --> 00:13:21,904
It's good to know
you're all right, buddy.

204
00:13:21,904 --> 00:13:23,216
- Okay, you take care now.

205
00:13:25,701 --> 00:13:27,323
Something was
 stirring inside me,

206
00:13:27,323 --> 00:13:28,946
it was like pulling me back.

207
00:13:28,946 --> 00:13:30,464
I felt like I was going crazy.

208
00:13:31,603 --> 00:13:33,364
- You saying that
 your strange behavior

209
00:13:33,364 --> 00:13:35,953
was caused by some kind
 of schizophrenia episode?

210
00:13:37,195 --> 00:13:39,370
- You've got to
 understand something.

211
00:13:39,370 --> 00:13:41,372
I'm going along,
 see, living the life.

212
00:13:42,442 --> 00:13:44,237
Doing the job,
 thinking I'm this guy.

213
00:13:44,237 --> 00:13:47,240
And one day I found
 out I'm not me.

214
00:13:47,240 --> 00:13:48,448
I'm somebody else.

215
00:13:49,621 --> 00:13:51,071
Somebody born out
 of a nightmare.

216
00:13:52,935 --> 00:13:54,592
- So, your conversation
with Waverley

217
00:13:54,592 --> 00:13:56,352
at the racquetball court,

218
00:13:56,352 --> 00:13:58,665
that's what prompted you
to go to Palm Springs?

219
00:14:00,184 --> 00:14:02,082
- Something was
 eating at me inside.

220
00:14:03,601 --> 00:14:05,914
If Carlo was out there,
then I had to find him.

221
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:10,159
A buddy of mine at the
 Palm Springs DA office

222
00:14:10,159 --> 00:14:11,126
gave me the name
 of the restaurant

223
00:14:11,126 --> 00:14:13,818
the local wise guys hung out.

224
00:14:13,818 --> 00:14:16,441
I wasn't the only one
 staking out the joint.

225
00:14:16,441 --> 00:14:19,582
[camera clicks]

226
00:14:19,582 --> 00:14:21,584
- What were you
 expecting to find?

227
00:14:23,276 --> 00:14:26,727
[soft piano music]

228
00:14:26,727 --> 00:14:28,108
[camera clicks]

229
00:14:28,108 --> 00:14:31,008
[soft piano music]

230
00:14:41,708 --> 00:14:44,469
[car motor hums]

231
00:14:49,164 --> 00:14:52,098
[soft piano music]

232
00:14:55,825 --> 00:14:58,587
[birds chirping]

233
00:15:07,527 --> 00:15:10,426
[soft piano music]

234
00:15:19,401 --> 00:15:21,817
[gun clicks]

235
00:15:23,508 --> 00:15:25,855
[gate hums]

236
00:15:27,202 --> 00:15:29,929
[car motor hums]

237
00:15:34,554 --> 00:15:37,281
[birds chirping]

238
00:15:45,427 --> 00:15:48,188
[birds chirping]

239
00:15:57,094 --> 00:16:00,338
[alarm beeping softly]

240
00:16:09,969 --> 00:16:11,971
[men grunting]

241
00:16:11,971 --> 00:16:16,976
[legs thudding]
[Nick groaning]

242
00:16:30,299 --> 00:16:31,749
- Nicholas.

243
00:16:32,957 --> 00:16:35,753
Is this the ganef you
 say was following us?

244
00:16:35,753 --> 00:16:38,928
Oh God, get, get.

245
00:16:38,928 --> 00:16:40,482
Nicholas, come, come,
 come, shh, shh, shh.

246
00:16:40,482 --> 00:16:41,655
Come, sit down.

247
00:16:42,829 --> 00:16:44,244
Why are you here?

248
00:16:45,418 --> 00:16:47,213
- That's what I'd
 like to know, Manny.

249
00:16:47,213 --> 00:16:48,145
You tell me.

250
00:16:49,284 --> 00:16:50,423
And what's an East
 Coast attorney

251
00:16:50,423 --> 00:16:52,735
doing with the syndicate
in Palm Springs?

252
00:16:52,735 --> 00:16:54,841
- Oh, they're clients.

253
00:16:54,841 --> 00:16:58,534
You lie down with dogs,
you get up with fleas.

254
00:16:58,534 --> 00:16:59,501
I count you with your--

255
00:16:59,501 --> 00:17:00,329
- No, no.

256
00:17:01,330 --> 00:17:03,022
This is not legal.

257
00:17:03,022 --> 00:17:04,540
- Legal?

258
00:17:04,540 --> 00:17:06,266
What's the difference?

259
00:17:06,266 --> 00:17:07,681
We're lawyers.

260
00:17:07,681 --> 00:17:10,788
We deal in the business
of interpretations.

261
00:17:15,206 --> 00:17:17,553
That's not why you're
 here, is it, my son?

262
00:17:21,419 --> 00:17:22,248
- No.

263
00:17:24,457 --> 00:17:28,288
- [sighs] I have always dreaded
that this day would come.

264
00:17:30,635 --> 00:17:33,224
And now you shall
 have that you seek.

265
00:17:35,261 --> 00:17:39,782
Nicholas, this is
 your brother, Carlo.

266
00:17:41,750 --> 00:17:43,027
- Hiya, little brother.

267
00:17:45,443 --> 00:17:48,343
[soft piano music]

268
00:17:55,557 --> 00:17:58,111
[hand patting]

269
00:18:05,843 --> 00:18:07,569
[hand patting]

270
00:18:07,569 --> 00:18:09,502
Yeah.

271
00:18:09,502 --> 00:18:14,507
[Carlo chuckling]
 [hand patting]

272
00:18:15,715 --> 00:18:16,819
Little Nicky here comes
running across the yard,

273
00:18:16,819 --> 00:18:18,062
dropping his diapers.

274
00:18:18,062 --> 00:18:20,133
He runs buck naked up to Papa.

275
00:18:20,133 --> 00:18:21,514
Papa picks him up.

276
00:18:21,514 --> 00:18:23,032
You remember how burly Papa was?

277
00:18:23,032 --> 00:18:24,517
- [Manny] Yeah.

278
00:18:24,517 --> 00:18:26,726
- So, he picks Nicky up, holds
 him up like this, you know?

279
00:18:26,726 --> 00:18:28,210
All of a sudden, Nicky lets go.

280
00:18:28,210 --> 00:18:29,867
Squirts the old man
 right in the face!

281
00:18:29,867 --> 00:18:30,937
[men laughing]

282
00:18:30,937 --> 00:18:32,111
Pissed right in his eye.

283
00:18:32,111 --> 00:18:33,802
[men laughing]

284
00:18:33,802 --> 00:18:37,150
He always called you
 squirt after that. [laughs]

285
00:18:41,396 --> 00:18:42,190
- Carlo.

286
00:18:43,467 --> 00:18:44,468
What was Papa like?

287
00:18:47,126 --> 00:18:48,403
- You don't remember?

288
00:18:48,403 --> 00:18:50,612
- No, I mean, I was just a kid.

289
00:18:53,546 --> 00:18:55,030
- He had a big laugh.

290
00:18:55,030 --> 00:18:57,239
You could hear him bellow
 anywhere in the house.

291
00:18:57,239 --> 00:18:58,447
But he had a temper.

292
00:18:59,414 --> 00:19:00,794
Like a good Italian son,

293
00:19:00,794 --> 00:19:02,382
I guarded myself
 whenever I walked by him.

294
00:19:02,382 --> 00:19:05,247
I never knew if he was
gonna hug me or cuff me.

295
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:06,421
He liked to hit.

296
00:19:07,353 --> 00:19:10,528
Yeah, but you, you got off easy.

297
00:19:10,528 --> 00:19:12,461
He mellowed a lot with you.

298
00:19:12,461 --> 00:19:14,083
For the first six months
after you were born,

299
00:19:14,083 --> 00:19:15,982
I don't think he
 put you down once.

300
00:19:15,982 --> 00:19:19,123
He was always walking
 around with you in his arms.

301
00:19:19,123 --> 00:19:21,677
[coughs] Course that changed
 some after you peed on him.

302
00:19:21,677 --> 00:19:24,266
[men laughing]

303
00:19:28,581 --> 00:19:30,376
Gabrielle, sweetheart.

304
00:19:32,240 --> 00:19:33,172
You're up.

305
00:19:34,621 --> 00:19:36,796
Hey, come on over here, I
 want you to meet somebody.

306
00:19:36,796 --> 00:19:40,731
Gabrielle, Kiki, this is
my kid brother, Nicky.

307
00:19:40,731 --> 00:19:42,181
- It's very nice to meet you.

308
00:19:43,596 --> 00:19:45,184
- Carlo, I thought we
 were gonna go out tonight.

309
00:19:45,184 --> 00:19:46,392
- Hey, not tonight, babe.

310
00:19:46,392 --> 00:19:48,256
Come on, it ain't every
day you hook back up

311
00:19:48,256 --> 00:19:49,774
with your kid brother.

312
00:19:49,774 --> 00:19:51,500
- Carlo, I'm bored, and you
 said we were gonna go out.

313
00:19:51,500 --> 00:19:52,915
And you said it'd be tonight.
 - We ain't gonna.

314
00:19:52,915 --> 00:19:54,434
So cool your jets.

315
00:19:54,434 --> 00:19:55,918
- Well, Kiki and I can go out,

316
00:19:55,918 --> 00:19:57,748
and you can just ask Silvio
 to bring the car around.

317
00:19:57,748 --> 00:19:59,370
- Yeah, who do you think
you are, her father?

318
00:19:59,370 --> 00:20:00,509
- Will you tell her to shut up?

319
00:20:00,509 --> 00:20:02,408
You ain't going nowhere.

320
00:20:02,408 --> 00:20:03,340
- We're going out.

321
00:20:03,340 --> 00:20:05,825
- No, I said, now sit down.

322
00:20:11,210 --> 00:20:12,211
- Come on, Carlo.

323
00:20:12,211 --> 00:20:14,420
Don't be such a hard ass.

324
00:20:14,420 --> 00:20:16,042
- What's your problem?

325
00:20:16,042 --> 00:20:17,871
I bring you out here, you can
 do whatever you broads want.

326
00:20:17,871 --> 00:20:21,289
Lay out by the pool, tan your
 tits, go shopping, whatever.

327
00:20:21,289 --> 00:20:23,532
All I ask is you look good
 when you're hanging on my arm,

328
00:20:23,532 --> 00:20:25,776
be a good screw and
 show a little respect!

329
00:20:30,056 --> 00:20:32,023
I said sit, you sit.

330
00:20:33,646 --> 00:20:34,474
Sit!

331
00:20:35,820 --> 00:20:37,132
You fuckin' want some of this,

332
00:20:37,132 --> 00:20:38,892
I'll fuckin' give
 you some of this!

333
00:20:38,892 --> 00:20:40,135
- Carlo, take it easy, okay.

334
00:20:40,135 --> 00:20:41,826
You don't have to get
 so rough with her.

335
00:20:42,724 --> 00:20:44,864
- Hey, hey, college boy.

336
00:20:47,556 --> 00:20:52,458
You may be the big dick
 in LA, but in this house,

337
00:20:52,458 --> 00:20:53,873
I'm pezzonovante.

338
00:20:55,771 --> 00:20:57,428
I call the shots.

339
00:20:57,428 --> 00:20:59,188
- Hey, tough guy.

340
00:20:59,188 --> 00:21:00,397
This is family?

341
00:21:00,397 --> 00:21:02,295
- Hey, I don't want
 no grief from you!

342
00:21:02,295 --> 00:21:04,193
I'll tell you when I
 want to hear from you.

343
00:21:04,193 --> 00:21:05,954
Otherwise you stay shut!

344
00:21:05,954 --> 00:21:09,992
- Well, some gangster,
 terrorize an old man.

345
00:21:09,992 --> 00:21:12,995
[suspenseful music]

346
00:21:17,690 --> 00:21:20,348
[belt smacking]

347
00:21:22,246 --> 00:21:23,074
- Yeah.

348
00:21:26,906 --> 00:21:28,114
Hey, you're lucky,
 you know that?

349
00:21:28,114 --> 00:21:29,633
You don't have to live
 with Papa's temper

350
00:21:29,633 --> 00:21:32,705
when you're like me, you know?

351
00:21:32,705 --> 00:21:35,639
It comes quick, like
 lightning. [grunts]

352
00:21:37,951 --> 00:21:39,228
Hey, come on.

353
00:21:39,228 --> 00:21:40,022
I'm just letting off
 a little steam here,

354
00:21:40,022 --> 00:21:41,300
you know what I mean?

355
00:21:42,922 --> 00:21:44,303
Hey, hey, hey.

356
00:21:48,203 --> 00:21:50,861
Hey, how come you're
 so different than me?

357
00:21:52,518 --> 00:21:54,520
I look at you, I
see Mama's face.

358
00:21:57,523 --> 00:21:58,455
But your different.

359
00:21:59,628 --> 00:22:01,975
- Nicholas is a
 good boy, this kid.

360
00:22:07,464 --> 00:22:09,466
- Hey, you hungry, baby?

361
00:22:11,882 --> 00:22:14,160
- You know, Manny
 promised we'd go to Vegas.

362
00:22:14,160 --> 00:22:17,336
And there's a volcano
 in the swimming pool.

363
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:20,304
And I just love getting it on
 with clowns in circus circles.

364
00:22:20,304 --> 00:22:24,412
- [laughs] You got
 to just love her.

365
00:22:24,412 --> 00:22:25,758
[wine splashing]

366
00:22:25,758 --> 00:22:27,035
- You know, this reminds
me of the time I was

367
00:22:27,035 --> 00:22:29,762
working with Jimmy the
 Fin, you remember him?

368
00:22:29,762 --> 00:22:32,109
What am I saying, you
was just a little dink.

369
00:22:32,109 --> 00:22:34,318
So Jimmy, he had
 these jealous streaks.

370
00:22:34,318 --> 00:22:37,217
He, especially when he
 came to his old lady, boom.

371
00:22:37,217 --> 00:22:39,737
He was convinced she was
 doing half the neighborhood.

372
00:22:39,737 --> 00:22:40,980
So, one day he follows her.

373
00:22:40,980 --> 00:22:42,188
He finds her in bed
 with another guy--

374
00:22:42,188 --> 00:22:43,431
- [Nick Voiceover] I
realized that Carlo was

375
00:22:43,431 --> 00:22:45,812
like every bad guy I
 had ever prosecuted.

376
00:22:45,812 --> 00:22:48,712
And deep inside, I had
 a problem with that.

377
00:22:48,712 --> 00:22:50,230
Over the next few days,

378
00:22:50,230 --> 00:22:52,681
he gave me an insider's
 look at the criminal world,

379
00:22:52,681 --> 00:22:53,924
and it was mesmerizing.

380
00:22:55,408 --> 00:22:57,997
- Well, you see a lot of
 guys who make their bones

381
00:22:57,997 --> 00:22:59,619
probably already hit
 a couple three guys

382
00:22:59,619 --> 00:23:01,276
before they get made.

383
00:23:01,276 --> 00:23:03,623
It's kind of like them fighter
 pilots making ace, see.

384
00:23:03,623 --> 00:23:06,833
They gotta be confirmed
hits or it don't count.

385
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:08,973
- How many guys you gotta
 kill to make your bones?

386
00:23:08,973 --> 00:23:11,493
- Well, only one, but
 you don't get made

387
00:23:11,493 --> 00:23:13,184
till somebody says you did it.

388
00:23:14,047 --> 00:23:15,324
It was kinda like me.

389
00:23:15,324 --> 00:23:17,741
I whacked maybe three,
 four guys coming up.

390
00:23:17,741 --> 00:23:20,295
The man who says I'd
 made turns out to be,

391
00:23:22,642 --> 00:23:23,678
you ready for this?

392
00:23:25,231 --> 00:23:26,232
Sammy G.

393
00:23:27,785 --> 00:23:29,408
- Sammy G.

394
00:23:29,408 --> 00:23:30,754
- You ever heard of him?

395
00:23:30,754 --> 00:23:33,619
- Wasn't he some big
time hood out of Jersey?

396
00:23:33,619 --> 00:23:36,553
- No, he was more than that.

397
00:23:39,245 --> 00:23:41,661
Sammy G was the son of a
bitch that whacked Papa.

398
00:23:43,422 --> 00:23:45,562
- Are you sure?
- Of course.

399
00:23:45,562 --> 00:23:47,046
Of course, I'm sure.

400
00:23:49,289 --> 00:23:50,290
Beautiful, ain't it?

401
00:23:51,913 --> 00:23:55,434
I ended up going to work
for the prick, 10 years.

402
00:23:57,436 --> 00:23:59,438
- You worked for the
 guy who killed Papa?

403
00:24:01,440 --> 00:24:03,269
- Hey look, pal.

404
00:24:03,269 --> 00:24:06,755
Sooner or later, everybody
 works with everybody.

405
00:24:10,656 --> 00:24:14,901
Hey Manny, Manny,
 Manny. [chuckles]

406
00:24:16,524 --> 00:24:18,042
So kid, tell me what was it like

407
00:24:18,042 --> 00:24:20,838
having your little pink butt
 pampered by this old man?

408
00:24:20,838 --> 00:24:22,046
- Old?

409
00:24:22,046 --> 00:24:24,393
[chuckles] I'll
 dance on your grave.

410
00:24:24,393 --> 00:24:27,466
- [laughs] I couldn't wait
 to get out of college, right?

411
00:24:27,466 --> 00:24:29,813
Then after law school, all I
 wanted to do was go back in.

412
00:24:29,813 --> 00:24:30,745
- Yeah.

413
00:24:30,745 --> 00:24:31,849
Hey, tell me.

414
00:24:33,610 --> 00:24:35,025
You stick it to a
 lot of college pussy

415
00:24:35,025 --> 00:24:36,613
in the back of a convertible?

416
00:24:36,613 --> 00:24:38,200
- I didn't let him
 have a convertible.

417
00:24:38,200 --> 00:24:39,443
It's too dangerous.

418
00:24:39,443 --> 00:24:41,341
And you can't get
 warm in winter.

419
00:24:41,341 --> 00:24:42,377
Who needs the headache?

420
00:24:42,377 --> 00:24:45,863
No, for Nicholas, a sedan.

421
00:24:47,175 --> 00:24:48,797
- A sedan?

422
00:24:50,281 --> 00:24:52,698
Manny gave you a sedan?

423
00:24:53,699 --> 00:24:54,907
- A Buick.

424
00:24:54,907 --> 00:24:56,598
- Nicholas is a good boy.

425
00:24:56,598 --> 00:24:58,876
He got good grades,
 he earned it.

426
00:24:58,876 --> 00:25:00,602
- So, he gets a car,
 goes to college,

427
00:25:00,602 --> 00:25:03,018
and I grow up living
 on the streets.

428
00:25:03,018 --> 00:25:04,744
And why is that?

429
00:25:04,744 --> 00:25:05,987
I'll tell you.

430
00:25:05,987 --> 00:25:09,128
See, you were a
 cute little baby.

431
00:25:09,128 --> 00:25:13,201
Everybody loves cute little
 babies, you know what I mean?

432
00:25:13,201 --> 00:25:14,616
They're like puppies.

433
00:25:15,652 --> 00:25:17,136
Me, I had no where to go.

434
00:25:17,136 --> 00:25:19,034
Manny wouldn't take
 me in like he did you.

435
00:25:19,034 --> 00:25:20,139
- You were a punk.

436
00:25:20,139 --> 00:25:21,658
- Yeah, punk.

437
00:25:22,659 --> 00:25:24,005
I was too old for ya.

438
00:25:27,180 --> 00:25:28,423
My family gets wiped out.

439
00:25:28,423 --> 00:25:31,115
Because I'm too old, you
wouldn't give me shit.

440
00:25:34,636 --> 00:25:38,502
And now you're working for
 me, how do you like that?

441
00:25:38,502 --> 00:25:41,747
[chuckles] Yeah,
 that's right, pal.

442
00:25:44,266 --> 00:25:45,095
You know something?

443
00:25:45,095 --> 00:25:47,373
For me, the best.

444
00:25:48,823 --> 00:25:53,275
The best food, best broads,
 best lawyers and Manny here.

445
00:25:53,862 --> 00:25:54,829
[lips smacking]

446
00:25:54,829 --> 00:25:55,726
He's the best.

447
00:25:58,902 --> 00:26:01,974
Hey, kid, you play
 it, right, who knows?

448
00:26:01,974 --> 00:26:04,390
Maybe you come work for me too.

449
00:26:04,390 --> 00:26:08,532
Never hurts to have a DA
in your pocket. [laughs]

450
00:26:10,499 --> 00:26:12,571
Yeah? [laughs]

451
00:26:14,020 --> 00:26:15,919
- [Nick Voiceover] But then
 I would get a reality check.

452
00:26:15,919 --> 00:26:17,437
Carlo had a way of doing that.

453
00:26:25,791 --> 00:26:28,759
- I'm sick and tired of
 being stuck in this house.

454
00:26:28,759 --> 00:26:31,003
Day in, day out.

455
00:26:37,526 --> 00:26:40,771
[suspenseful music]

456
00:26:40,771 --> 00:26:42,290
Christ, Carlo, you don't
 fucking pay attention to me.

457
00:26:42,290 --> 00:26:44,292
All you do is talk to
 your stupid brother.

458
00:26:44,292 --> 00:26:46,535
You want everybody to
 think you're such a big man

459
00:26:46,535 --> 00:26:47,985
and you're nothing.

460
00:26:47,985 --> 00:26:49,746
You are fucking nothing,
 and you know that I know it.

461
00:26:49,746 --> 00:26:51,264
- [Carlo] You're asking for it.

462
00:26:51,264 --> 00:26:52,611
Now you want it?

463
00:26:52,611 --> 00:26:54,889
You want some Goddamn
 attention, bitch!

464
00:26:54,889 --> 00:26:56,235
Well, you got it!
 - No!

465
00:26:56,235 --> 00:26:57,063
[belt slaps]

466
00:26:57,063 --> 00:26:58,375
- Okay?
- No!

467
00:26:58,375 --> 00:26:59,203
[belt slaps]
 - You had enough, have ya?

468
00:26:59,203 --> 00:27:00,446
You had enough?
- No!

469
00:27:00,446 --> 00:27:01,585
- Carlo, what the
 hell you doing?

470
00:27:01,585 --> 00:27:03,000
- Stay out of it!

471
00:27:04,036 --> 00:27:06,210
- Get the fuck outta here!

472
00:27:06,210 --> 00:27:07,487
[shoe smacks]

473
00:27:07,487 --> 00:27:10,490
[suspenseful music]

474
00:27:11,457 --> 00:27:13,873
[belt thuds]

475
00:27:17,187 --> 00:27:19,051
- Carlo Augustine,
 what a sweetheart.

476
00:27:20,224 --> 00:27:22,054
This guy's in juvenile
 hall until he's 18,

477
00:27:22,054 --> 00:27:24,470
and he walks with
 a clean record.

478
00:27:24,470 --> 00:27:28,577
28 arrests, including
 numbers, drugs, racketeering,

479
00:27:28,577 --> 00:27:31,201
prostitution,
 assault, laundering.

480
00:27:31,201 --> 00:27:33,134
You name it, this guy's done it.

481
00:27:33,134 --> 00:27:38,139
Murder, and implicated on five
 others with no convictions.

482
00:27:38,622 --> 00:27:39,554
Why?

483
00:27:39,554 --> 00:27:41,590
Because he's got a good lawyer.

484
00:27:41,590 --> 00:27:42,419
Like you.

485
00:27:43,558 --> 00:27:44,593
Manny Kohen.

486
00:27:45,802 --> 00:27:48,805
[crickets chirping]

487
00:27:58,573 --> 00:28:00,817
- So, pal, tell me.

488
00:28:01,956 --> 00:28:03,198
What are you thinking
 about doing in LA?

489
00:28:03,198 --> 00:28:04,613
You gonna be like
 a judge or what?

490
00:28:04,613 --> 00:28:06,098
- I don't know.

491
00:28:06,098 --> 00:28:07,064
I was thinking about going
 up to the federal level.

492
00:28:07,064 --> 00:28:08,238
- Really?
 - Yeah.

493
00:28:08,238 --> 00:28:10,343
Maybe even the Attorney
General's office.

494
00:28:10,343 --> 00:28:11,586
- I bet you got a lot
of good stuff you could

495
00:28:11,586 --> 00:28:13,968
use against me, huh?
 - It's privileged.

496
00:28:13,968 --> 00:28:17,005
I couldn't testify against
 you even if I wanted to.

497
00:28:17,005 --> 00:28:19,767
But I do know the federal
 boys are interested in you.

498
00:28:19,767 --> 00:28:21,044
- What are you talking about?

499
00:28:21,044 --> 00:28:22,217
- Yeah, they're putting
together an organized

500
00:28:22,217 --> 00:28:23,356
crime task force.

501
00:28:24,185 --> 00:28:25,600
You made the A list.

502
00:28:26,739 --> 00:28:28,776
- Yeah?
 - Mm-hmm.

503
00:28:28,776 --> 00:28:30,260
- What do you know about it?

504
00:28:30,260 --> 00:28:33,194
- Well, not too much, just
 that they got a name for you.

505
00:28:34,678 --> 00:28:35,679
Toy godfather.

506
00:28:36,715 --> 00:28:39,096
- Toy godfather, that's cute.

507
00:28:43,894 --> 00:28:44,895
- Yeah, I like that.

508
00:28:45,896 --> 00:28:47,070
That's funny, you know.

509
00:28:48,727 --> 00:28:50,418
It sounds like something
 they put on for Christmas.

510
00:28:50,418 --> 00:28:51,591
Toy godfather.

511
00:28:53,421 --> 00:28:56,389
[suspenseful music]

512
00:28:56,389 --> 00:28:57,563
Toy godfather.

513
00:28:59,599 --> 00:29:00,980
I'm a made mafioso.

514
00:29:02,223 --> 00:29:05,191
Not some cannoli movie actor.

515
00:29:05,191 --> 00:29:07,090
I killed men.

516
00:29:07,090 --> 00:29:10,852
I ran neighborhoods in Queens,
 in Brooklyn, the Bronx!

517
00:29:10,852 --> 00:29:12,578
Now, I'm building a
 West Coast franchise.

518
00:29:12,578 --> 00:29:16,030
And you come into my house
 and call me toy godfather?

519
00:29:16,030 --> 00:29:18,584
- Nicholas doesn't think
 this, the government does.

520
00:29:18,584 --> 00:29:19,619
- Shut up!

521
00:29:19,619 --> 00:29:21,483
You, what do you know?

522
00:29:21,483 --> 00:29:22,761
You work for any
carbone that comes along

523
00:29:22,761 --> 00:29:24,763
with a couple of
 shekels in his pocket.

524
00:29:24,763 --> 00:29:26,005
- And you don't?

525
00:29:26,005 --> 00:29:27,489
- Yeah, but with
 me it's different.

526
00:29:27,489 --> 00:29:31,079
Now you take Sammy G, the most
 respected Don of his time.

527
00:29:31,079 --> 00:29:32,322
And I whacked him!

528
00:29:32,322 --> 00:29:35,635
- Sammy G, Sammy
 G, always Sammy G!

529
00:29:35,635 --> 00:29:36,844
Enough already!

530
00:29:36,844 --> 00:29:39,156
- Sammy G taught me very
many valuable lessons

531
00:29:39,156 --> 00:29:40,433
with his mockery.

532
00:29:41,607 --> 00:29:43,989
Every day he'd laugh
 at me, every day!

533
00:29:46,198 --> 00:29:47,993
Coming into our house.

534

00:41:10,502 --> 00:41:11,710
- Walk!

712
00:41:11,710 --> 00:41:13,885
- Can you believe
 that, my own brother.

[footsteps pattering]

726
00:42:32,860 --> 00:42:34,137
- Nick, I'm tired.

727
00:42:34,137 --> 00:42:35,863
I don't want to go any
 further, my feet hurt.

728
00:42:37,037 --> 00:42:38,763
I'm just gonna sit
 here and that's it!

729
00:42:40,765 --> 00:42:42,905
- Give me your shoes.

730
00:42:42,905 --> 00:42:44,113
- No.
 - Give me your shoes.

731
00:42:44,113 --> 00:42:45,597
I'm gonna take
 the heels off 'em.

732
00:42:45,597 --> 00:42:47,012
- Look, if you wanna stomp
 around the desert all night,

733
00:42:47,012 --> 00:42:49,394
that's fine with me,
 but I'm staying here.

734
00:42:51,465 --> 00:42:52,259
- Great.

735
00:42:53,467 --> 00:42:56,297
All right, listen, it's
pitch black out here.

736
00:42:56,297 --> 00:42:57,954
We'll probably stumble
in the cactus all night.

737
00:42:57,954 --> 00:42:59,231
I don't want to do that.

738
00:42:59,231 --> 00:43:00,301
Okay, we'll stay
 here, that's fine.

739
00:43:00,301 --> 00:43:01,406
Is that all right with you?

740
00:43:01,406 --> 00:43:02,994
- That's fine with me.
 - Great.

741
00:43:04,582 --> 00:43:05,444
Let me just.

[rock banging]
[chain rattling]

743
00:43:24,015 --> 00:43:28,157
Hey, Gab, I got, there's
 some burlap bags in here.

744
00:43:29,192 --> 00:43:30,435
Some boots.

745
00:43:33,852 --> 00:43:34,681
Pick.

746
00:43:37,925 --> 00:43:40,548
What do you think?

747
00:43:40,548 --> 00:43:41,722
[object rattles]

748
00:43:41,722 --> 00:43:44,173
All right, here, why
don't you put these on?

749
00:43:44,173 --> 00:43:46,658
Here, put this one on,
it's freezing out here.

750
00:43:49,661 --> 00:43:51,490
Here, put these on.

751
00:43:51,490 --> 00:43:52,975
Give me your feet.

752
00:43:52,975 --> 00:43:57,980
[fire crackling]
[hands rubbing]

753
00:43:59,982 --> 00:44:01,777
- You don't like me
 very much, do you?

754
00:44:04,158 --> 00:44:05,090
- No, you're all right.

755
00:44:05,090 --> 00:44:06,298
You know, it's just that--

756
00:44:06,298 --> 00:44:07,645
- I'm just not
 your type of girl.

757
00:44:09,370 --> 00:44:11,718
- You don't have to put
words into my mouth.

758
00:44:11,718 --> 00:44:13,374
I just don't understand
how a girl like you--

759
00:44:13,374 --> 00:44:16,205
- Would be with somebody
 like your brother, Carlo.

760
00:44:21,624 --> 00:44:22,901
- Want to tell me about it?

761
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:25,490
- What?

762
00:44:27,250 --> 00:44:28,079
- You and Carlo.

763
00:44:29,736 --> 00:44:31,254
I mean, if you don't mind.

764
00:44:31,254 --> 00:44:33,671
I mean, we'll be here a
 while, so it's up to you.

765
00:44:37,226 --> 00:44:38,054
- I don't mind.

766
00:44:42,093 --> 00:44:44,923
It's like somehow your
 brother just understood me.

767
00:44:44,923 --> 00:44:46,269
Or at least he understood
 where I was vulnerable,

768
00:44:46,269 --> 00:44:48,686
and we connected in that way.

769
00:44:49,687 --> 00:44:50,929
- Carlo, vulnerable?

770
00:44:52,344 --> 00:44:57,315
- Yeah, he was hurt, and we
both knew that about each other.

771
00:44:58,385 --> 00:45:00,870
[gentle music]

772
00:45:02,907 --> 00:45:04,011
See, my father used
 to beat on my mom

773
00:45:04,011 --> 00:45:05,944
right till the day he died.

774
00:45:05,944 --> 00:45:09,983
And that kind of
 thing just, well,

775
00:45:09,983 --> 00:45:11,501
it just affects you
 in ways sometimes you

776
00:45:11,501 --> 00:45:13,400
don't even understand.

777
00:45:15,505 --> 00:45:16,955
It's like, I always pick
the one guy in the room

778
00:45:16,955 --> 00:45:18,854
who's gonna make
 my life miserable.

779
00:45:21,235 --> 00:45:23,617
Maybe it's just that you
go with what you know.

780
00:45:25,274 --> 00:45:29,312
Like my boyfriend
 before, Jimmy Simpliotti.

781
00:45:29,312 --> 00:45:30,693
- Jimmy Simpliotti?

782
00:45:30,693 --> 00:45:32,730
- Jimmy Simple is
 what they called him.

783
00:45:34,628 --> 00:45:36,906
He was the collector for
 the boys in Atlantic City,

784
00:45:36,906 --> 00:45:41,531
which basically meant
that he dished out pain.

785
00:45:41,531 --> 00:45:42,774
So, you'd pay your visit,

786
00:45:42,774 --> 00:45:44,017
and depending on how
 much money you owed

787
00:45:44,017 --> 00:45:47,020
was about the amount
 of grief that you got.

788
00:45:47,020 --> 00:45:49,367
- Sounds like a real nice guy.

789
00:45:49,367 --> 00:45:50,195
- Yeah.

790
00:45:52,370 --> 00:45:53,820
I was an exotic dancer,

791
00:45:53,820 --> 00:45:56,512
and I was working in this
 club when I met Carlo.

792
00:45:57,996 --> 00:46:00,516
The money was good
 and you get good tips

793
00:46:00,516 --> 00:46:02,173
if you sit on the
 customer's laps,

794
00:46:02,173 --> 00:46:03,415
you know, so they can feel you,

795
00:46:03,415 --> 00:46:05,279
but I never hooked or
 anything like that.

796
00:46:05,279 --> 00:46:08,593
It was just, you
 know, just tacky.

797
00:46:11,423 --> 00:46:13,253
And Jimmy used to
 hang out there.

798
00:46:14,495 --> 00:46:16,083
And he took a real liking to me,

799
00:46:17,429 --> 00:46:19,224
except that he was
 really crazy and jealous.

800
00:46:19,224 --> 00:46:21,123
And so when Carlo came in,

801
00:46:21,123 --> 00:46:25,437
and he started treating
me really nice.

802
00:46:26,714 --> 00:46:28,406
He started paying me
 a lot of attention,

803
00:46:28,406 --> 00:46:30,339
told me I was good,
 and I was good.

804
00:46:31,547 --> 00:46:32,790
And he told me that he
 knew all these people

805
00:46:32,790 --> 00:46:33,998
in show business.

806
00:46:33,998 --> 00:46:37,139
And well, Jimmy got
all pissed off about it

807
00:46:37,139 --> 00:46:38,347
and got in Carlo's face.

808
00:46:39,624 --> 00:46:41,557
- Not a good idea, huh?

809
00:46:41,557 --> 00:46:43,076
- No.

810
00:46:43,076 --> 00:46:44,353
I was supposed to meet
 Jimmy the next night,

811
00:46:44,353 --> 00:46:46,493
and then Carlo shows up instead,

812
00:46:46,493 --> 00:46:48,806
and he brought me this
heart-shaped candy box.

813
00:46:50,117 --> 00:46:52,671
I never saw Jimmy again.

814
00:46:52,671 --> 00:46:54,604
- That's when you started
 seeing my brother?

815
00:46:56,089 --> 00:46:56,917
- Yeah.

816
00:47:00,196 --> 00:47:02,958
I mean, Carlo
 decided that for me.

817
00:47:04,200 --> 00:47:06,789
[gentle music]

818
00:47:09,619 --> 00:47:13,347
Do you have a
 girlfriend back in LA?

819
00:47:13,347 --> 00:47:14,176
- I did.

820
00:47:16,557 --> 00:47:18,007
She was a drinker, we...

821
00:47:19,975 --> 00:47:21,183
We had to break up.

822
00:47:24,634 --> 00:47:26,982
- So, what's it like
 being a district attorney?

823
00:47:28,431 --> 00:47:30,848
- It's a job, you know,
just like any other job.

824
00:47:33,126 --> 00:47:35,818
I'm just attracted
 to the bad guys too.

[gentle music]

826
00:47:53,111 --> 00:47:55,286
- What are you looking at?

827
00:47:57,495 --> 00:47:58,323
- You.

828
00:48:03,673 --> 00:48:05,503
- Your brother
 isn't even cold yet.

 The next morning,

833
00:48:34,118 --> 00:48:35,360
we followed an old service road,

834
00:48:35,360 --> 00:48:36,914
hoping it would
 lead to somewhere.

835
00:48:37,984 --> 00:48:40,020
- Is that where Officer
Thorpe was killed?

836
00:48:41,159 --> 00:48:42,436
- No, that came later.

Well, what's happening?

853
00:50:24,193 --> 00:50:25,574

What do you think?

00:53:48,259 --> 00:53:51,262
[building crashing]

891
00:53:55,542 --> 00:53:58,545
[suspenseful music]

892
00:54:05,242 --> 00:54:06,691
Hey, you!

893
00:54:06,691 --> 00:54:10,971
[man groans]
 [body thuds]

894
00:54:10,971 --> 00:54:13,698
[car door slams]

895
00:54:13,698 --> 00:54:15,044
You okay?
 - Yeah!

896
00:54:16,701 --> 00:54:17,771
Oh, look out!

897
00:54:20,257 --> 00:54:22,535
[body thuds]

898
00:54:22,535 --> 00:54:24,916
[plank thuds]

899
00:54:24,916 --> 00:54:28,265
- [Nick] Let's get
 the hell out of here.

900
00:54:32,372 --> 00:54:35,133
[engine revving]

901
00:54:38,861 --> 00:54:43,866
[engine humming]
[tires skidding]

902
00:54:45,040 --> 00:54:47,180
- I want to wrap up this
Officer Thorpe thing.

903
00:54:49,458 --> 00:54:50,459
- There was something
 definitely not right

904
00:54:50,459 --> 00:54:52,427
about this officer's procedures.

905
00:54:53,566 --> 00:54:55,257
I was just too tired
 to give a damn.

906
00:54:55,257 --> 00:54:57,915
[siren wailing]

907
00:55:02,126 --> 00:55:05,094
[suspenseful music]

908
00:55:05,094 --> 00:55:10,099
[siren wailing]
[motor humming]

909
00:55:12,585 --> 00:55:15,519
[radio chattering]

910
00:55:17,244 --> 00:55:18,591
Am I glad to see you.

911
00:55:18,591 --> 00:55:19,902
- Let me see your
driver's license please.

912
00:55:19,902 --> 00:55:20,731
- Yeah, sure.

913
00:55:21,904 --> 00:55:24,217
Nick August with the
 DA's office out of LA.

914
00:55:24,217 --> 00:55:25,874
- Right, DA's office.

915
00:55:25,874 --> 00:55:28,670
- Officer Thorpe, you're not
 gonna believe this, okay?

916
00:55:28,670 --> 00:55:30,188
There's two dead
 bodies out there.

917
00:55:30,188 --> 00:55:31,914
Yesterday somebody killed my
 brother and his bodyguard.

918
00:55:31,914 --> 00:55:33,295
There's a couple of Chinese guys

919
00:55:33,295 --> 00:55:34,227
buried in a lot somewhere
 in Palm Springs.

920
00:55:34,227 --> 00:55:35,435
I'm telling you, we had a...

921
00:55:35,435 --> 00:55:36,988
What the hell are you
 doing, man? [groans]

922
00:55:36,988 --> 00:55:39,197
- I'm just gonna see if
your story checks out.

923
00:55:42,097 --> 00:55:45,549
You have the right to
 remain silent, use it.

924
00:55:49,346 --> 00:55:52,245
[radio chattering]

925
00:55:52,245 --> 00:55:54,247
And you say that you and
the little woman here

926
00:55:54,247 --> 00:55:57,423
killed a bunch of
 armed ninja bandits?

927
00:55:57,423 --> 00:55:58,872
- I didn't say they
 were ninja bandits.

928
00:55:58,872 --> 00:56:00,736
They were Triad assassins.

929
00:56:00,736 --> 00:56:01,979
- Right, assassins.

930
00:56:03,394 --> 00:56:05,154
And they're supposed to
 be around here somewhere?

931
00:56:05,154 --> 00:56:06,570
- I don't know exactly
 they are, okay?

932
00:56:06,570 --> 00:56:08,675
We had to get out of
 there as fast as we could.

933
00:56:10,125 --> 00:56:11,747
Now, what I'm thinking is
 if we can get a chopper

934
00:56:11,747 --> 00:56:13,508
coming from the east,
 cover this ground,

935
00:56:13,508 --> 00:56:14,371
we can catch up to
 'em really fast.

936
00:56:14,371 --> 00:56:16,165
- Right, chopper.

937
00:56:16,165 --> 00:56:18,340
- Oh, for Christ sakes.

938
00:56:18,340 --> 00:56:19,824
This is really starting
to piss me off.

939
00:56:19,824 --> 00:56:21,964
- I'm gonna give
 you a chance to run

940
00:56:21,964 --> 00:56:23,207
because I don't want
 it to look like you

941
00:56:23,207 --> 00:56:25,485
were in custody, you
 know what I mean?

942
00:56:25,485 --> 00:56:26,728
[body thudding]

943
00:56:26,728 --> 00:56:29,558
Somebody wants you to
 disappear real bad.

944
00:56:29,558 --> 00:56:31,215
Go on out there a ways.

945
00:56:31,215 --> 00:56:34,287
- Officer, you're
 making a big mistake.

946
00:56:34,287 --> 00:56:37,463
[gunshot blasting]

947
00:56:37,463 --> 00:56:40,155
[body thudding]

948
00:56:47,300 --> 00:56:49,682
[gun thumps]

949
00:56:57,724 --> 00:57:00,140
- So, it was Gabrielle
 that shut Officer Thorpe?

950
00:57:01,797 --> 00:57:03,143
- She saved my life.

951
00:57:04,524 --> 00:57:06,871
- An officer was shot,
 and you contacted nobody<

952
00:57:08,632 --> 00:57:10,047
- I didn't have that option.

953
00:57:14,569 --> 00:57:17,330
[romantic music]

954
00:59:15,344 --> 00:59:16,932
- So, you went
 back to Los Angeles

955
00:59:16,932 --> 00:59:19,072
and went straight back
 to your apartment.

956
00:59:20,764 --> 00:59:22,973
- I had witnessed five murders.

957
00:59:22,973 --> 00:59:25,976
I'm involved in the death of a
 cop, all in a 24-hour period.

958
00:59:30,877 --> 00:59:33,500
[gentle music]

959
00:59:55,522 --> 00:59:56,593
I just had to think.

960
00:59:58,595 --> 01:00:00,597
But whatever happened next,

961
01:00:02,391 --> 01:00:04,083
I knew that I had
 to take control.

962
01:00:05,084 --> 01:00:07,638
[gentle music]

963
01:00:21,721 --> 01:00:24,310
[cars humming]

964
01:00:25,138 --> 01:00:27,796
[door creaking]

965
01:00:33,526 --> 01:00:36,184
[lamp clicking]

966
01:00:45,572 --> 01:00:48,679
[flashlight clicking]

967
01:00:58,137 --> 01:00:59,656
- Hey, bub.

968
01:00:59,656 --> 01:01:01,036
You find anything interesting?

969
01:01:02,348 --> 01:01:04,315
- Yeah, you're filing
 system is a mess.

970
01:01:06,145 --> 01:01:07,353
- I'm very disappointed.

971
01:01:08,285 --> 01:01:09,286
I thought we were buddies.

972
01:01:09,286 --> 01:01:10,459
- That makes two of us.

973
01:01:13,739 --> 01:01:15,223
- We're gonna have to
 take you into custody

974
01:01:15,223 --> 01:01:17,121
for the murder of a police
 officer named Thorpe.

975
01:01:17,121 --> 01:01:18,295
Nick, don't!

976
01:01:18,295 --> 01:01:21,298
[suspenseful music]

977
01:01:30,894 --> 01:01:33,690
[latch clicking]

978
01:01:36,175 --> 01:01:39,178

[tennis ball whacking]
 [body thudding]

981
01:02:14,178 --> 01:02:17,354
[footsteps pattering]

982
01:02:20,115 --> 01:02:21,876
[garbage bin rattling]

983
01:02:21,876 --> 01:02:24,879
[suspenseful music]

984
01:02:42,724 --> 01:02:47,729
[racket whacking]
 [body thudding]

985
01:02:50,939 --> 01:02:53,597
[ball thumping]

986
01:03:00,777 --> 01:03:02,779
Ah, Nick!

987
01:03:05,264 --> 01:03:08,163
Not my new graphite matrix!

988
01:03:08,163 --> 01:03:09,302
You're dead meat!

989
01:03:10,441 --> 01:03:13,444
[ice cubs rattling]

990
01:03:15,999 --> 01:03:17,794
- Hey, Manny!
 - Hmm?

991
01:03:17,794 --> 01:03:19,209
Nicolas, I was worried.

992
01:03:19,209 --> 01:03:20,313
- We gotta get
 outta here, Manny.

993
01:03:20,313 --> 01:03:21,556
It was a setup.

994
01:03:21,556 --> 01:03:22,971
There's a hit on
 me and I'm wanted.

995
01:03:22,971 --> 01:03:24,179
There's Chinese thugs
 coming out of the woodwork.

996
01:03:24,179 --> 01:03:25,629
I came back to
 get you, let's go!

997
01:03:25,629 --> 01:03:26,941
- Oh, Nicholas, Nicholas,
you're talking like your crazy.

998
01:03:26,941 --> 01:03:27,873
- Crazy, man, you bet your ass!

999
01:03:27,873 --> 01:03:29,288
They just killed Carlo, okay?

1000
01:03:31,980 --> 01:03:35,777
- Hey, kid, how ya
 doin'? [chuckles]

1001
01:03:35,777 --> 01:03:38,538
So, tell me, you think I
 could make it in Hollywood?

1002
01:03:39,539 --> 01:03:40,782
- Oh!

1003
01:03:40,782 --> 01:03:44,544
- Oh, baby, I'm
 not going nowhere.

1004
01:03:44,544 --> 01:03:46,546
I'm immortal.
[lips smacking]

1005
01:03:46,546 --> 01:03:48,272
Don't you know that?

1006
01:03:48,272 --> 01:03:49,515
Hey, what's wrong?

1007
01:03:49,515 --> 01:03:50,550
Smart college boy
 like you never heard

1008
01:03:50,550 --> 01:03:52,242
of a bulletproof vest?

1009
01:03:52,242 --> 01:03:53,830
- I don't get it.

1010
01:03:53,830 --> 01:03:56,625
- We had to do a little save
face for the Asian connections.

1011
01:03:56,625 --> 01:03:58,455
It's political,
 don't worry about it.

1012
01:03:59,663 --> 01:04:02,355
Besides, I wanted to
see which side you were

1013
01:04:02,355 --> 01:04:04,185
buttering your bread.

1014
01:04:04,185 --> 01:04:05,117
- [Nick] Did you know?

1015
01:04:05,117 --> 01:04:07,084
- I knew, but I never approved.

1016
01:04:07,084 --> 01:04:08,292
- Hey, think of it as hell week

1017
01:04:08,292 --> 01:04:09,776
at the frat house,
 college boy. [laughs]

1018
01:04:09,776 --> 01:04:11,848
- You son of a bitch!
 [hand slaps]

1019
01:04:11,848 --> 01:04:13,194
You nearly got us killed!

1020
01:04:13,194 --> 01:04:14,402
- What, who?

1021
01:04:14,402 --> 01:04:15,886
- What do you mean
 who, you had no idea?

1022
01:04:15,886 --> 01:04:17,163
- Hey, what are
 you talking here?

1023
01:04:17,163 --> 01:04:18,440
I faked up a death
 scene, that's all.

1024
01:04:18,440 --> 01:04:19,372
I didn't send no...

1025
01:04:19,372 --> 01:04:21,098
Hey, come on, give me a break.

1026
01:04:21,098 --> 01:04:23,583
- I just killed three
 Triad assassins.

1027
01:04:25,206 --> 01:04:28,140
- Hey. [laughs]

1028
01:04:28,140 --> 01:04:30,694
My little brother
finally made his bones.

1029
01:04:30,694 --> 01:04:33,352
- Yeah, well Gabrielle
 made her bones too.

1030
01:04:33,352 --> 01:04:35,112
She killed a cop.

1031
01:04:38,840 --> 01:04:42,740
- I can't tell you how
 proud I am. [laughs]

1032
01:04:42,740 --> 01:04:44,501
You showed initiative.

1033
01:04:44,501 --> 01:04:45,709
- I'm not amused.

1034
01:04:47,159 --> 01:04:48,574
What about the
 Chinese guys, huh?

1035
01:04:48,574 --> 01:04:50,507
- Eh, that was just a hit.

1036
01:04:50,507 --> 01:04:51,680
Just business.

1037
01:04:53,890 --> 01:04:54,787
Hey, Mr. Wing?

1038
01:04:58,204 --> 01:05:00,586
You know anything about
any Triad assassins?

1039
01:05:02,243 --> 01:05:03,071
Yeah.

1040
01:05:04,279 --> 01:05:06,419
I had to do some house
 cleaning for Mr. Wing.

1041
01:05:07,558 --> 01:05:09,526
Now, we've got the
 right people in place.

1042
01:05:10,907 --> 01:05:14,565
You're looking at the new
 West Coast Chinese connection.

1043
01:05:14,565 --> 01:05:16,636
[Wing laughs]

1044
01:05:16,636 --> 01:05:18,431
And you're in it too, Nick.

1045
01:05:18,431 --> 01:05:19,674
Keep it in the family.

1046
01:05:21,020 --> 01:05:23,057
We're gonna do some
 serious business together.

1047
01:05:27,130 --> 01:05:29,477
- Would you excuse us, please?

1048
01:05:29,477 --> 01:05:32,204
I want to talk to
 Nicholas alone.

1049
01:05:33,343 --> 01:05:35,000
- More dirty little
 secrets, Manny?

1050
01:05:35,000 --> 01:05:35,862
- Oh.

1051
01:05:37,830 --> 01:05:41,454
- Ciao, babe.
[lips smacking]

1052
01:05:41,454 --> 01:05:46,183
- The truth is I am an old
 man with very few pleasures.

1053
01:05:49,152 --> 01:05:52,120
Now, that I look
back on my life,

1054
01:05:52,120 --> 01:05:55,952
I am not very proud
 of my accomplishments,

1055
01:05:55,952 --> 01:05:57,781
although I am proud of you.

1056
01:05:59,610 --> 01:06:02,682
But this is not what
 I wanted for you.

1057
01:06:02,682 --> 01:06:05,996
No, this is not at
 all what I wanted.

1058
01:06:07,170 --> 01:06:12,037
For you, a judge,
 maybe a senator.

1059
01:06:13,176 --> 01:06:15,178
Maybe even president
like Jack Kennedy, hmm?

1060
01:06:17,180 --> 01:06:18,975
But that is not to be.

1061
01:06:20,183 --> 01:06:23,082
You are involved with Carlo.

1062
01:06:25,912 --> 01:06:28,363
Fate is playing a cruel game.

1063
01:06:30,193 --> 01:06:31,918
- I've come to accept it, Manny.

1064
01:06:34,128 --> 01:06:36,164
Questa e mia familia.

1065
01:06:39,996 --> 01:06:43,171
- Nicholas, you are
 not of this family!

1066
01:06:44,931 --> 01:06:46,105
- What do you mean?

1067
01:06:46,105 --> 01:06:47,589
- I raised you,
 not these carbones!

1068
01:06:48,901 --> 01:06:50,730
You were not to be part of this!

1069
01:06:51,973 --> 01:06:53,733
- I saw his criminal
 record, Manny.

1070
01:06:55,080 --> 01:06:56,805
How did he get to
 become so powerful?

1071
01:06:56,805 --> 01:06:59,774
- Well, he's connected,
very high up.

1072
01:06:59,774 --> 01:07:02,190
Someone very powerful
 is watching over him.

1073
01:07:02,190 --> 01:07:06,539
And now the Chinese
 want his allegiance.

1074
01:07:06,539 --> 01:07:08,714
But it's you I'm worried about.

1075
01:07:08,714 --> 01:07:12,062
You're dug in, your
life is forever changed.

1076
01:07:12,062 --> 01:07:13,788
You are a gangster.

1077
01:07:19,449 --> 01:07:24,005
I was young once myself
 and full of bright ideas.

1078
01:07:24,005 --> 01:07:28,078
Then I took a couple of
cases I shouldn't have.

1079
01:07:28,078 --> 01:07:30,494
Oh, the money was very good.

1080
01:07:31,840 --> 01:07:34,740
And soon, I was in.

1081
01:07:37,639 --> 01:07:40,366
Look, I can arrange to get
 you out of the country,

1082
01:07:40,366 --> 01:07:42,782
but you have to act at once.

1083
01:07:42,782 --> 01:07:44,163
- I can take care of myself.

1084
01:07:45,923 --> 01:07:46,752
- Can you?

1085
01:07:49,548 --> 01:07:50,687
You really think so.

1086
01:07:55,485 --> 01:07:58,660
Then you are in, and
 I can't help you.

1087
01:08:20,441 --> 01:08:22,063
- [Carlo] What do you want?

1088
01:08:22,063 --> 01:08:22,891
I guessed wrong.

1089
01:08:26,654 --> 01:08:30,140
No, it's family,
it's my problem.

1090
01:08:31,590 --> 01:08:32,936
I'll take care of it.

1091
01:08:37,492 --> 01:08:40,909
[footsteps pattering]

1092
01:08:40,909 --> 01:08:41,738
- [Nick] Carlo.

1093
01:08:41,738 --> 01:08:43,119
- Hey, there he is.

1094
01:08:44,879 --> 01:08:45,811
- What's going on?

1095
01:08:45,811 --> 01:08:47,813
- I gotta get outta here, today.

1096
01:08:47,813 --> 01:08:49,159
- What for?

1097
01:08:49,159 --> 01:08:50,402
- Killing that cop's
 bringing too much heat on us.

1098
01:08:50,402 --> 01:08:51,334
Silvio's bringing
 the car around.

1099
01:08:51,334 --> 01:08:52,749
Come on, Gabrielle, let's go.

1100
01:08:57,616 --> 01:08:58,479
Now!

1101
01:08:58,479 --> 01:09:01,551
[footsteps pattering]

1102
01:09:01,551 --> 01:09:05,658
- It's unseasonably chilly
today, you should dress warmly.

1103
01:09:07,660 --> 01:09:08,903
- I got a sweater.

1104
01:09:08,903 --> 01:09:09,938
- You'll need it.

1105
01:09:17,567 --> 01:09:18,395
Great.

1106
01:09:20,846 --> 01:09:23,573
[tires rumbling]

1107
01:09:34,342 --> 01:09:36,344
[car doors slamming]

1108
01:09:36,344 --> 01:09:37,966
- Yeah, this is all right.

1109
01:09:39,727 --> 01:09:43,351
Hey, Silvio, go get the picnic
 basket out of the trunk.

1110
01:09:56,606 --> 01:09:59,574
I know you're packing,
 Nicky, hand it over.

1111
01:10:02,750 --> 01:10:04,200
Come on, don't play games.

1112
01:10:11,448 --> 01:10:12,277
Come on.

1113
01:10:17,213 --> 01:10:18,559
- Carlo, he's your brother.

1114
01:10:18,559 --> 01:10:19,387
- Shut up.

1115
01:10:22,528 --> 01:10:24,737
I heard you pick up on
 the phone last night.

1116
01:10:28,431 --> 01:10:29,673
- Let's do it.

1117
01:10:29,673 --> 01:10:30,985
- Start walking.

1118
01:10:35,955 --> 01:10:38,924
Come on, you, I want
 you to see this.

1119
01:10:38,924 --> 01:10:40,236
- God, you're hurting me!

1120
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:42,272
- Good, you cheat on me!

1121
01:10:43,239 --> 01:10:45,033
What, you think I didn't know?

1122
01:10:45,033 --> 01:10:46,000
- Let her go, Carlo.

1123
01:10:47,657 --> 01:10:49,072
- One shot, Nicky.

1124
01:10:50,936 --> 01:10:52,075
You won't even hear it.

1125
01:10:54,111 --> 01:10:56,010
That's how I took Sammy G out.

1126
01:10:56,010 --> 01:10:57,667
I shot him right
 through the ears.

1127
01:10:58,909 --> 01:11:00,117
They had to bury him
 in a closed casket,

1128
01:11:00,117 --> 01:11:01,395
and I laughed at his funeral.

1129
01:11:01,395 --> 01:11:04,052
10 years I waited to
get close to that prick!

1130
01:11:06,020 --> 01:11:07,297
Just like I am to you.

1131
01:11:09,472 --> 01:11:13,269
- Hey, Carlo, you gonna do it?

1132
01:11:13,269 --> 01:11:18,274
Then you go ahead and you do it.

1133
01:11:19,033 --> 01:11:19,999
- That a boy, Nicky.

1134
01:11:21,794 --> 01:11:22,623
Don't beg.

1135
01:11:23,865 --> 01:11:26,627
Sammy G begged and
 cried like a baby.

1136
01:11:28,076 --> 01:11:31,321
And you know what he told me
 before I blew his brains out?

1137
01:11:32,736 --> 01:11:37,534
He said, "Killing your
 Papa was just a contract.

1138
01:11:38,294 --> 01:11:40,813
"You know, business."

1139
01:11:42,539 --> 01:11:44,472
- Is this business too, Carlo?

1140
01:11:45,439 --> 01:11:49,235
- No, this is self-preservation.

1141
01:11:50,478 --> 01:11:51,859
[suspenseful music]

1142
01:11:51,859 --> 01:11:56,001
[gunshot blasting]
 [Gabrielle screaming]

1143
01:11:56,001 --> 01:11:59,832
[Gabrielle whimpering]

1144
01:11:59,832 --> 01:12:01,558
I could kill you,
 don't you know that?

1145
01:12:01,558 --> 01:12:03,146
- What the hell
 is going on here?

1146
01:12:03,146 --> 01:12:05,217
- I'm saving your
 ass like I always do!

1147
01:12:06,563 --> 01:12:08,703
Silvio turned, cut his
 own deal with Wing.

1148
01:12:08,703 --> 01:12:10,395
He would have
 whacked you himself.

1149
01:12:11,361 --> 01:12:12,845
I had to get up close.

1150
01:12:12,845 --> 01:12:13,674
Hit men.

1151
01:12:15,745 --> 01:12:17,298
They could smell fear.

1152
01:12:18,506 --> 01:12:19,921
- You used me as a
 diversion, didn't you?

1153
01:12:19,921 --> 01:12:21,095
- Family business, Nicky.

1154
01:12:21,095 --> 01:12:22,752
You're family, I
never forget it.

1155
01:12:24,892 --> 01:12:26,963
Now, I got one more
 thing to do for Papa.

1156
01:12:29,759 --> 01:12:31,174
- Papa's been dead 20 years.

1157
01:12:33,487 --> 01:12:34,936
When are you gonna let it go?

1158
01:12:39,769 --> 01:12:43,220
- You want to know
 the truth, Nicky?

1159
01:12:43,220 --> 01:12:45,464
I died in that room that day.

1160
01:12:47,742 --> 01:12:50,400
My whole life's been
 spent avenging Papa.

1161
01:12:53,369 --> 01:12:54,300
I'm almost done.

1162
01:12:57,234 --> 01:12:59,202
But you got a life ahead of you.

1163
01:13:00,928 --> 01:13:03,033
Now get outta here and
 take here with you.

1164
01:13:04,966 --> 01:13:06,623
- Carlo, you come back with me,

1165
01:13:06,623 --> 01:13:09,764
I'll put you in the
 witness protection program.

1166
01:13:09,764 --> 01:13:10,972
I can help you.

1167
01:13:10,972 --> 01:13:12,905
- You're a good
 kid, you know that?

1168
01:13:16,322 --> 01:13:19,153
Here, I want you to
 have Papa's ring.

1169
01:13:22,915 --> 01:13:24,400
- I can help the both of you.

1170
01:13:25,504 --> 01:13:27,506
- I can't, it's destiny.

1171
01:13:31,165 --> 01:13:35,341
By the time you get back
 to LA, it'll all be over.

1172
01:13:41,037 --> 01:13:44,799
- Carlo, you can't
leave me here like this.

1173
01:13:44,799 --> 01:13:46,249
- Hey, Gabrielle, you're the
 eighth wonder of the world,

1174
01:13:46,249 --> 01:13:50,667
you know that, hm?
 [lips smacking]

1175
01:13:50,667 --> 01:13:52,289
But you gotta go where your
 bread's buttered right?

1176
01:13:52,289 --> 01:13:54,153
Now, your bread's
 buttered with squirt.

1177
01:13:54,153 --> 01:13:55,810
- I don't want this.

1178
01:13:56,846 --> 01:13:58,779
- Like Manny always says,

1179
01:14:00,090 --> 01:14:02,368
you lie down with dogs,
you get up with fleas.

1180
01:14:03,853 --> 01:14:06,856
[suspenseful music]

1181
01:14:12,827 --> 01:14:14,311
- Carlo.
 - I gotta go.

1182
01:14:15,174 --> 01:14:16,003
Family.

1183
01:14:17,142 --> 01:14:20,145

- You know, I gotta confide
 something in you, Nick.

1213
01:17:43,313 --> 01:17:46,144
You're like a tar
 baby of misery.

1214
01:17:46,144 --> 01:17:48,042
Anyone who touches you dies.

1215
01:17:49,285 --> 01:17:50,113
By the way.

1216
01:17:52,737 --> 01:17:54,083
Where's your fucking badge?

1217
01:17:59,191 --> 01:18:00,537
- I left it in my apartment.

1218
01:18:02,643 --> 01:18:05,301
You see, I didn't know who
 the good guys were anymore.

1219
01:18:09,477 --> 01:18:13,274
- What about Wing, why
 didn't you kill him?

1220
01:18:13,274 --> 01:18:16,484
He tried to kill you,
he killed your brother.

1221
01:18:16,484 --> 01:18:17,693
Why didn't you kill him?

1222
01:18:21,075 --> 01:18:23,526
- The apple doesn't
fall far from the tree.

1223
01:18:26,356 --> 01:18:27,737
I didn't have it in me then,

1224
01:18:30,706 --> 01:18:32,431
and I don't know
 now, Mr. Winslow.

1225
01:18:40,163 --> 01:18:41,682
- [Winslow] You're free to go.

1226
01:18:46,238 --> 01:18:47,446
- Nicholas!

1227
01:18:47,446 --> 01:18:49,241
- Surprised to see me, Manny?

1228
01:18:49,241 --> 01:18:52,486
- Oh, Nicholas, you could give
 an old man a heart attack.

1229
01:18:52,486 --> 01:18:55,316
- Yeah, if you had a heart.

1230
01:18:57,008 --> 01:18:58,388
- I since hostility.

1231
01:18:58,388 --> 01:18:59,907
- Hostility?

1232
01:18:59,907 --> 01:19:00,701
No.

1233
01:19:01,667 --> 01:19:02,910
I would say that I'm impressed,

1234
01:19:02,910 --> 01:19:03,877
but then I've always
been impressed with you,

1235
01:19:03,877 --> 01:19:05,326
haven't I, Manny?

1236
01:19:05,326 --> 01:19:07,018
- Impressed, that's good?

1237
01:19:07,018 --> 01:19:07,846
- That's good.

1238
01:19:09,261 --> 01:19:10,538
Just like you, Manny.

1239
01:19:14,163 --> 01:19:16,752
- Sit, sit, sit, we'll talk.

1240
01:19:16,752 --> 01:19:19,755
[chair creaking]

1241
01:19:19,755 --> 01:19:22,033
- It took me awhile
 to piece it together.

1242
01:19:23,172 --> 01:19:25,277
It was a bunch of
 little things, really.

1243
01:19:25,277 --> 01:19:29,109
Then I saw the report
 the FBI had on you.

1244
01:19:29,109 --> 01:19:30,558
- The FBI?

1245
01:19:30,558 --> 01:19:32,008
- Yeah.

1246
01:19:32,008 --> 01:19:33,976
They've been watching you
 now for over 20 years.

1247
01:19:33,976 --> 01:19:36,668
- [laughs] That's the
 trouble with this business.

1248
01:19:36,668 --> 01:19:38,946
Someone is always watching you.

1249
01:19:40,120 --> 01:19:42,087
- You covered your
 ass pretty well,

1250
01:19:42,087 --> 01:19:44,296
but there was one small
fact you overlooked.

1251
01:19:47,023 --> 01:19:49,405
- Fact, what fact?

1252
01:19:49,405 --> 01:19:51,752
- You were my
 father's consigliere.

1253
01:19:51,752 --> 01:19:53,512
- Yeah, that's
 true, you knew that.

1254
01:19:53,512 --> 01:19:56,308
- And then you went
 to work for Sammy G.

1255
01:19:56,308 --> 01:19:58,655
- [laughs] Sammy G.

1256
01:20:00,174 --> 01:20:02,004
When he took over your
 father's concerns,

1257
01:20:02,004 --> 01:20:03,074
he took me with him.

1258
01:20:04,454 --> 01:20:05,662
In this business,

1259
01:20:05,662 --> 01:20:07,733
you always go where
your bread is buttered.

1260
01:20:07,733 --> 01:20:09,390
- You were heavily connected.

1261
01:20:10,633 --> 01:20:13,084
You were watching over Carlo.

1262
01:20:13,084 --> 01:20:15,120
You weren't working for him.

1263
01:20:15,120 --> 01:20:17,467
He was working for you,
only he didn't know it.

1264
01:20:18,779 --> 01:20:21,747
- In my own way, I was
watching over both of you boys.

1265
01:20:21,747 --> 01:20:25,027
- No, and Carlo was on to you.

1266
01:20:25,027 --> 01:20:26,683
- On to me?

1267
01:20:26,683 --> 01:20:28,824
Why should Carlo be on to me?

1268
01:20:28,824 --> 01:20:29,997
For what?

1269
01:20:29,997 --> 01:20:33,587
- I remember that day,
 that terrible day.

1270
01:20:35,140 --> 01:20:37,246
We were in the living
 room when they came.

1271
01:20:38,212 --> 01:20:39,800
The noise was like thunder.

1272
01:20:39,800 --> 01:20:44,598
[gunshots blasting]
 [thunder cracking]

1273
01:20:44,598 --> 01:20:47,566
[suspenseful music]

1274
01:21:19,322 --> 01:21:20,496
He brought me to you.

1275
01:21:22,567 --> 01:21:23,775
To you, Manny.

1276
01:21:23,775 --> 01:21:25,535
You were waiting
 outside in the car.

1277
01:21:27,227 --> 01:21:29,056
You knew what was going on.

1278
01:21:29,056 --> 01:21:33,612
- Nicholas, you hurt me
with these accusations.

1279
01:21:33,612 --> 01:21:34,682
- Come on, Manny.

1280
01:21:36,236 --> 01:21:38,583
Carlo didn't fake his
 death to see what I'd do.

1281
01:21:39,756 --> 01:21:41,172
He wanted to see
 what you would do.

1282
01:21:44,554 --> 01:21:45,555
And what did you do?

1283
01:21:47,212 --> 01:21:49,318
You put a contract out on me.

1284
01:21:49,318 --> 01:21:50,906
- Oh, you, no.

1285
01:21:50,906 --> 01:21:53,149
I never sent the
 assassins after you.

1286
01:21:53,149 --> 01:21:55,945
That was Silvio's doing, alone.

1287
01:21:57,222 --> 01:22:00,708
Later I learned that
 Wing didn't trust you.

1288
01:22:00,708 --> 01:22:02,400
And I was outraged.

1289
01:22:02,400 --> 01:22:04,298
- I'm not talking
 about the assassins.

1290
01:22:05,472 --> 01:22:06,818
It was the state trooper.

1291
01:22:09,303 --> 01:22:10,442
You don't buy the state police

1292
01:22:10,442 --> 01:22:11,892
unless you got a lotta juice.

1293
01:22:12,962 --> 01:22:14,722
And you got a
 lotta juice, Manny.

1294
01:22:15,723 --> 01:22:16,932
And then when I came back,

1295
01:22:16,932 --> 01:22:18,519
you knew he had to
 get rid of both of us.

1296
01:22:18,519 --> 01:22:19,313
- No.

1297
01:22:20,556 --> 01:22:21,833
Nicholas, I love you.

1298
01:22:21,833 --> 01:22:23,317
Don't be ridiculous.

1299
01:22:23,317 --> 01:22:27,321
- The day Carlo died, he
 knew I was carrying a gun.

1300
01:22:28,633 --> 01:22:29,530
You told him.

1301
01:22:30,669 --> 01:22:33,741
You set it up so we'd
 both shoot it out.

1302
01:22:40,231 --> 01:22:43,303
[fist slams]
 [Manny sighs]

1303
01:22:43,303 --> 01:22:47,238
- So many years, the guilt.

1304
01:22:48,273 --> 01:22:50,655
I am not a perfect person.

1305
01:22:54,107 --> 01:22:55,625
This is the hard part.

1306
01:22:59,871 --> 01:23:02,839
Armand Augustine
 is not your father.

1307
01:23:03,806 --> 01:23:07,016
[crickets chirping]

1308
01:23:07,016 --> 01:23:08,466
You are my son.

1309
01:23:16,025 --> 01:23:17,509
Nicolas, I love you.

1310
01:23:21,479 --> 01:23:24,516
Armand Augustine
 was a brutal man.

1311
01:23:24,516 --> 01:23:25,448
And he had no vision.

1312
01:23:25,448 --> 01:23:26,898
I made him great!

1313
01:23:28,313 --> 01:23:31,937
But all he saw was a fixer,
 someone to do legal work.

1314
01:23:33,836 --> 01:23:36,977
Then your mother
 and I fell in love.

1315
01:23:36,977 --> 01:23:40,601
It was not supposed to happen
 that way, but things happen.

1316
01:23:42,224 --> 01:23:43,742
She couldn't leave her husband.

1317
01:23:43,742 --> 01:23:45,330
He would have killed us both.

1318
01:23:47,125 --> 01:23:49,714
Then he found out about us.

1319
01:23:49,714 --> 01:23:50,542
And then you.

1320
01:23:52,786 --> 01:23:57,791
He gave Sammy G the hit on
 me and I turned the tables.

1321
01:24:00,690 --> 01:24:05,695
Sammy was no Armand, but
I made him something.

1322
01:24:06,420 --> 01:24:08,698
Then Carlo killed him.

1323
01:24:08,698 --> 01:24:12,495
Carlo could have
 been even greater,

1324
01:24:12,495 --> 01:24:14,670
but all he ever
 wanted was revenge.

1325
01:24:15,843 --> 01:24:18,191
All that anger he
 walked around with.

1326
01:24:20,365 --> 01:24:23,437
And now there's you.

1327
01:24:23,437 --> 01:24:25,681
- And now you have to get
 rid of me, don't you, Manny?

1328
01:24:25,681 --> 01:24:28,201
- May God strike me dead.

1329
01:24:28,201 --> 01:24:30,858
- Yeah, well you should have
 when you had the chance.

1330
01:24:32,688 --> 01:24:34,483
The Feds picked me
 up the other day.

1331
01:24:36,519 --> 01:24:38,832
They told me that
 the hit's out on you.

1332
01:24:40,075 --> 01:24:42,111
The Triads have you
 marked for death.

1333
01:24:44,217 --> 01:24:45,632
You're caught in the middle.

1334
01:24:46,840 --> 01:24:48,566
- Goddamn!

1335
01:24:48,566 --> 01:24:51,086
Even in death, Carlo
 has me by the balls!

1336
01:24:54,330 --> 01:24:57,575
His hotheaded plan
 started all of this.

1337
01:24:58,507 --> 01:25:01,441
[crickets chirping]

1338
01:25:08,275 --> 01:25:10,105
Can you help me out of this?

1339
01:25:12,797 --> 01:25:13,625
- No.

1340
01:25:16,663 --> 01:25:18,423
- You reap what you sow.

1341
01:25:22,324 --> 01:25:24,947
Well, at least try
 to save yourself, eh.

1342
01:25:26,811 --> 01:25:28,295
- Don't worry about me, Manny.

1343
01:25:29,434 --> 01:25:30,401
I'll be okay.

1344
01:25:32,472 --> 01:25:37,373
- You know, ironically,
I'm very proud of you.

1345
01:25:46,555 --> 01:25:51,560
Goodbye, my son.

1346
01:25:55,150 --> 01:25:56,565
- Goodbye, Manny.

1347
01:26:03,848 --> 01:26:06,609
[birds chirping]

1348
01:26:08,784 --> 01:26:10,165
[Manny sighs]

1349
01:26:10,165 --> 01:26:12,857
[glasses clink]

1350
01:26:15,584 --> 01:26:18,587

[tires rumbling]

1356

[soft piano music]

1357
01:27:19,303 --> 01:27:21,995
[door thudding]

1358
01:27:34,007 --> 01:27:37,010
- [Nick Voiceover] Why was I
 under investigation, Anson?

1359
01:27:37,010 --> 01:27:39,702
- [Anson] What makes
 you think that?

1360
01:27:39,702 --> 01:27:41,463
You know, they happened
to find your name

1361
01:27:41,463 --> 01:27:43,396
buried inside another
 investigation?

1362
01:27:45,501 --> 01:27:46,606
You had us worried.

1363
01:27:47,607 --> 01:27:50,265
And were trying to find out...

1364
01:27:50,265 --> 01:27:52,405
- [Nick Voiceover] Which side
 I was buttering my bread.

1365
01:27:53,751 --> 01:27:56,995
- [Anson] No, son
 of the godfather.

1366
01:27:57,893 --> 01:27:59,170
I mean, this does not look good

1367
01:27:59,170 --> 01:28:00,861
on the resume of a
 district attorney.

1368
01:28:04,071 --> 01:28:05,832
They found Kohen's
 body on Tuesday.

1369
01:28:07,592 --> 01:28:09,180
He'd been dead about 30 hours.

1370
01:28:10,768 --> 01:28:13,046
Chinese didn't waste any time.

1371
01:28:13,046 --> 01:28:15,428
[ring thuds]

1372
01:28:22,676 --> 01:28:24,195
So, what are you gonna do, bub?

1373
01:28:25,334 --> 01:28:26,784
- [Nick Voiceover]
 Get on with my life.

1374
01:28:28,579 --> 01:28:29,925
- [Anson] Where will you go?

1375
01:28:31,098 --> 01:28:31,892
- [Nick Voiceover] I was
thinking about working

1376
01:28:31,892 --> 01:28:33,100
for organized crimes.

1377
01:28:34,792 --> 01:28:36,241
- [Anson] Why
 should they take ya?

1378
01:28:37,691 --> 01:28:38,692
- [Nick Voiceover]
Because I know something

1379
01:28:38,692 --> 01:28:39,900
about the criminal mind.

1380
01:28:54,501 --> 01:28:55,744
Now, when I look in the mirror,

1381
01:28:55,744 --> 01:28:57,953
I don't see myself
 like I used to.

1382
01:28:59,092 --> 01:29:02,440
I see Carlo and
 Manny and Gabrielle.

1383
01:29:03,993 --> 01:29:06,168
But at least now I
 know where I came from

1384
01:29:06,168 --> 01:29:07,169
and where I'm going.

1385
01:29:08,998 --> 01:29:09,896
And who I am.

1386
01:29:11,242 --> 01:29:12,899
There's always gonna be
a part of me that will

1387
01:29:12,899 --> 01:29:17,593
ask the question, if Carlo
 and I had changed places,

1388
01:29:17,593 --> 01:29:19,112
how would I have turned out?

1389
01:29:20,527 --> 01:29:22,115
[engine revving]

1390
01:29:22,115 --> 01:29:23,806
Cain and Abel,
 they were brothers.

1391
01:29:25,290 --> 01:29:26,637
One became a killer.

1392
01:29:28,880 --> 01:29:31,366
It could have gone either way.

1393
01:29:34,886 --> 01:29:37,820
