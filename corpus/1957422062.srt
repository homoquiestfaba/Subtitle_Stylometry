1
00:03:49,750 --> 00:03:51,708
Perfect. That was perfect.

2
00:03:52,250 --> 00:03:53,875
And upload.

3
00:04:25,458 --> 00:04:26,750
Okay, and…

4
00:04:28,583 --> 00:04:31,750
Time to start another boring day.

5
00:05:10,375 --> 00:05:11,250
Here you are.

6
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,458
Thank you.

7
00:05:14,500 --> 00:05:15,708
Here you go.

8
00:05:31,125 --> 00:05:33,875
OPEN

9
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,250
A very good morning. How can I be of help?

10
00:05:36,333 --> 00:05:40,125
Now, listen up, young man!

11
00:05:40,208 --> 00:05:44,000
In the old days
everything was better, far better…

12
00:06:31,375 --> 00:06:33,208
CLOSED

13
00:06:34,583 --> 00:06:36,000
I'm taking my lunch break.

14
00:06:56,083 --> 00:06:57,000
Wait.

15
00:07:46,625 --> 00:07:47,500
Hello, I'm…

16
00:07:49,250 --> 00:07:51,583
I'm not sure if this is the right address,

17
00:07:51,708 --> 00:07:54,583
but I'm here for a very secret issue.

18
00:07:54,625 --> 00:07:55,625
Do you understand?

19
00:09:31,625 --> 00:09:33,375
Okay, come on Sebastian, you can do it.

20
00:09:35,583 --> 00:09:37,625
You can do it.

21
00:16:33,458 --> 00:16:34,375
Thank you.

22
00:16:36,000 --> 00:16:37,000
Thanks.

23
00:16:41,875 --> 00:16:44,083
Damn it!

24
00:22:33,250 --> 00:22:36,458
In Nevada, a virus outbreak
of unknown origin continues to spread,

25
00:22:36,500 --> 00:22:41,083
causing a rabies-like response
in those who contract it.

26
00:22:41,125 --> 00:22:45,750
This has led to the public deeming
the outbreak "the zombie apocalypse."

27
00:22:46,583 --> 00:22:50,125
Amidst the epidemic, groups of civilians
are stepping up to do their part

28
00:22:50,208 --> 00:22:52,875
in helping to rescue survivors
stuck in the infected zone.

29
00:22:53,000 --> 00:22:55,958
Let's check in
with one of our correspondents,

30
00:22:56,000 --> 00:22:59,375
Gil Pedretti, on the ground in Las Vegas.

31
00:23:09,750 --> 00:23:11,500
Dear viewers,

32
00:23:12,208 --> 00:23:16,125
I can't tell you
exactly what's going on right now,

33
00:23:16,250 --> 00:23:19,500
but as you just saw, this is reality.

34
00:23:19,583 --> 00:23:23,458
This was really happening.

35
00:23:23,500 --> 00:23:26,500
As we get more information,

36
00:23:26,625 --> 00:23:30,000
we will certainly
give you an immediate update.

37
00:27:11,625 --> 00:27:13,625
That movie looks fucking awesome.

38
00:27:14,250 --> 00:27:15,458
Would you like to see it?

39
00:27:16,375 --> 00:27:18,000
It's not out yet.

40
00:35:56,125 --> 00:35:59,500
Excuse me, sir.
Could you hold these, please?

41
00:35:59,583 --> 00:36:01,625
-My pleasure.
-Very kind.

42
00:36:09,000 --> 00:36:11,458
I have an appointment
for the deposit room.

43
00:36:11,500 --> 00:36:12,583
Yes, please wait.

44
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:17,208
That way, please.

45
00:36:27,250 --> 00:36:30,083
-I'll leave you to it.
-Thank you.

46
00:36:44,500 --> 00:36:46,375
You speak English? A little bit?

47
00:36:47,000 --> 00:36:47,875
No.

48
00:36:48,750 --> 00:36:49,875
Just a moment.

49
00:36:53,333 --> 00:36:55,125
You speak English? A little bit?

50
00:36:56,375 --> 00:36:57,458
Of course.

51
00:37:05,625 --> 00:37:07,125
So sorry.

52
00:43:48,375 --> 00:43:49,625
Awesome!

53
00:44:10,250 --> 00:44:11,125
Yes.

54
00:53:12,083 --> 00:53:13,125
Silence!

55
00:53:23,125 --> 00:53:24,833
I did it. Yes!

56
00:53:24,875 --> 00:53:26,333
I'm a master!

57
00:53:28,458 --> 00:53:30,333
LUDWIG DIETER
MASTER SAFECRACKER AND EXPLORER

58
01:01:27,500 --> 01:01:28,500
Hi.

59
01:01:29,000 --> 01:01:32,250
Pavel, for the last time,
you can't drink in here.

60
01:01:36,583 --> 01:01:39,083
-Did you see that?
-Where did he go?

61
01:01:45,000 --> 01:01:46,000
He disappears.

62
01:01:58,000 --> 01:01:59,333
Just pretend.

63
01:02:58,375 --> 01:03:00,125
Show me your ID.

64
01:06:36,500 --> 01:06:39,458
-Something's not right here.
-Yes, I'm inclined to agree.

65
01:06:39,500 --> 01:06:43,208
I'm not missing our shot.
If they're inside…

66
01:06:44,875 --> 01:06:46,875
We're going to catch them.

67
01:06:57,208 --> 01:06:59,250
Got him. Cam 52.

68
01:07:01,958 --> 01:07:02,875
What the fuck!

69
01:07:03,500 --> 01:07:05,375
Someone's in our system.

70
01:09:48,500 --> 01:09:49,500
Shit.

71
01:10:51,083 --> 01:10:52,208
Okay! Let's go!

72
01:10:56,875 --> 01:10:58,000
What? Shit!

73
01:10:58,083 --> 01:10:59,458
What the fuck was that?

74
01:11:11,250 --> 01:11:12,125
Fucking Christ!

75
01:11:37,250 --> 01:11:38,333
Shit.

76
01:12:16,500 --> 01:12:17,625
Damn it.

77
01:14:45,375 --> 01:14:46,458
Freeze!

78
01:14:47,000 --> 01:14:47,958
Hands up!

79
01:14:49,125 --> 01:14:50,208
Slowly.

80
01:14:56,958 --> 01:14:59,083
Where are you?

81
01:17:06,250 --> 01:17:07,583
Fucking asshole.

82
01:17:39,708 --> 01:17:40,750
Stop!

83
01:17:41,458 --> 01:17:42,375
Police!

84
01:17:52,000 --> 01:17:53,333
That's my bike!

85
01:17:54,208 --> 01:17:56,125
Fuck you, asshole!

86
01:18:00,208 --> 01:18:01,000
Shit.

87
01:18:21,750 --> 01:18:22,750
Going to Old Town.

88
01:18:38,708 --> 01:18:39,583
Watch out!

89
01:18:47,625 --> 01:18:48,583
We lost him.

90
01:18:48,625 --> 01:18:49,708
Out of the way!

91
01:19:26,583 --> 01:19:29,208
Make way!

92
01:21:10,625 --> 01:21:12,208
Crazy! How did I do that?

93
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:22,375
Stop the car!

94
01:24:44,333 --> 01:24:45,208
Fuck off!

95
01:26:52,625 --> 01:26:54,958
Shit, shit, shit!

96
01:30:57,250 --> 01:31:00,208
Hello, my dear friends.
It's me again, your great safecracker.

97
01:31:00,958 --> 01:31:03,083
I hope you don't mind,
but the video today…

98
01:31:03,125 --> 01:31:04,000
I know him.

99
01:31:06,000 --> 01:31:07,583
I know this guy.

100
01:31:12,583 --> 01:31:14,375
Oh, fuck! This is the same guy.

101
01:31:23,333 --> 01:31:24,750
Come to my office, please.

102
01:31:24,875 --> 01:31:25,875
Yes. Now.

103
01:31:29,500 --> 01:31:31,000
I found you.

104
01:31:35,583 --> 01:31:36,375
Yes.

105
01:31:38,333 --> 01:31:41,125
So I hope this is super important news
because I--

106
01:31:41,250 --> 01:31:42,083
That's him.

107
01:31:43,500 --> 01:31:46,625
The guy who opens safes,
the safecracker, that's him.

108
01:31:47,083 --> 01:31:51,083
This guy comes out of nowhere. A German
guy who makes shitty YouTube videos.

109
01:31:51,125 --> 01:31:53,125
He's not a criminal.

110
01:31:54,083 --> 01:31:55,000
He's an outsider.

111
01:31:55,708 --> 01:31:58,000
Then who is this guy?
How does he know them?

112
01:31:58,083 --> 01:31:59,500
They found him like this,

113
01:32:01,125 --> 01:32:02,000
through YouTube.

114
01:32:02,500 --> 01:32:03,750
-Okay.
-Yeah.

115
01:32:04,583 --> 01:32:06,125
Maybe he's a patsy.

116
01:32:06,250 --> 01:32:08,250
Look at the poor guy.
They just dumped him on the road.

117
01:32:08,375 --> 01:32:10,458
He's scared shitless like Bambi.

118
01:32:12,500 --> 01:32:15,625
I almost feel bad for him.

119
01:32:18,125 --> 01:32:19,250
And that's all?

120
01:32:24,208 --> 01:32:26,000
-What? Yes, that's all.
-That's all?

121
01:32:26,125 --> 01:32:26,958
Yes, that's all.

122
01:32:28,000 --> 01:32:29,500
Super important information.

123
01:32:29,625 --> 01:32:31,500
You could have told me over the phone.

124
01:32:34,958 --> 01:32:37,000
Nice to meet you, Sebastian.

125
01:36:08,125 --> 01:36:09,750
We are informed about the risk.

126
01:36:10,333 --> 01:36:11,375
What do you mean?

127
01:36:11,500 --> 01:36:12,750
Please follow me.

128
01:36:22,833 --> 01:36:23,875
Who told you about the risk?

129
01:36:23,958 --> 01:36:27,625
You. And when you contacted us,
we took action immediately.

130
01:36:28,750 --> 01:36:30,833
What do you mean when we contacted you?

131
01:36:30,875 --> 01:36:33,250
You did. And as agreed,
we brought transport time forward.

132
01:36:33,375 --> 01:36:36,000
The safe left an hour and a half ago.

133
01:36:41,000 --> 01:36:44,250
-You brought the transport time forward?
-Yes.

134
01:36:44,750 --> 01:36:47,125
Last night,
when you informed us of the risk.

135
01:36:48,000 --> 01:36:50,833
But the transport is already underway.

136
01:36:52,875 --> 01:36:55,250
See, I told you
it was too good to be true.

137
01:36:56,458 --> 01:36:57,250
Why?

138
01:37:01,500 --> 01:37:03,750
It was planned for 5:00.

139
01:37:12,750 --> 01:37:14,000
Hello. This is Interpol.

140
01:37:14,083 --> 01:37:17,500
Are you aware that the safe
scheduled for transfer tomorrow morning

141
01:37:17,583 --> 01:37:19,250
is the third in a sequence of safes,

142
01:37:19,375 --> 01:37:22,708
two of which
have been robbed in the last 72 hours?

143
01:37:22,750 --> 01:37:23,958
One moment, please.

144
01:37:25,583 --> 01:37:26,833
Call the bank.

145
01:37:26,875 --> 01:37:30,083
See if they'll authorize us
moving the vault sooner than planned.

146
01:37:30,125 --> 01:37:31,125
Of course.

147
01:37:31,208 --> 01:37:34,083
Call me if there's a problem.
You're welcome.

148
01:42:05,750 --> 01:42:09,125
Five o'clock!

149
01:45:04,000 --> 01:45:05,500
-Let her…
-Where the hell are they?

150
01:45:05,583 --> 01:45:06,833
Let her! Let her go! Stop it!

151
01:53:36,375 --> 01:53:37,916
Delacroix, asshole.
