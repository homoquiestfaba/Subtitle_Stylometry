(Dramatic music playing)

2
00:00:58,367 --> 00:01:00,533
Man (On radio):
You're listening to
the mellow sounds

3
00:01:00,567 --> 00:01:03,067
Of kcup,
the k-cup,

4
00:01:03,100 --> 00:01:05,200
69 on your
radio dial.

5
00:01:05,233 --> 00:01:08,533
- (Alien noises)
- (Gibbering nonsense)

6
00:01:08,567 --> 00:01:11,233
(Gibbering continues)

7
00:01:20,667 --> 00:01:22,433
(Gibbering continues)

8
00:01:24,033 --> 00:01:26,600
(Screams)

9
00:01:28,000 --> 00:01:30,300
(Dramatic music playing)

10
00:01:35,067 --> 00:01:37,200
(Upbeat march playing)

11
00:01:40,433 --> 00:01:44,033
* attack of the killer
tomatoes *

12
00:01:44,067 --> 00:01:47,500
* attack of
the killer tomatoes *

13
00:01:47,533 --> 00:01:49,500
* they'll beat you, bash you,
squish you, mash you *

14
00:01:49,533 --> 00:01:51,500
* chew you up for brunch

15
00:01:51,533 --> 00:01:53,900

for dinner or lunch *

16
00:01:56,433 --> 00:01:59,900
* they're marching
down the halls *

17
00:01:59,933 --> 00:02:03,567
* they're crawling
up the walls *

18
00:02:03,600 --> 00:02:05,433
* they're gooey, gushy,
squishy, mushy *

19
00:02:05,467 --> 00:02:07,233
* rotten to the core

20
00:02:07,267 --> 00:02:10,800

outside your door *

21
00:02:12,667 --> 00:02:15,867

23
00:02:19,967 --> 00:02:21,433

00:02:21,467 --> 00:02:23,300
*Tomatoes hiding in his tree

25
00:02:23,333 --> 00:02:26,467
* now he's just a memory

26
00:02:28,500 --> 00:02:32,000

* tomatoes will have
their day *

36
00:03:00,467 --> 00:03:03,967
* attack of
the killer tomatoes *

37
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:07,367
* attack of
the killer tomatoes *

38
00:03:07,400 --> 00:03:09,333

42
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:20,333
* dinner or lunch

43
00:03:22,233 --> 00:03:24,467
Woman (Over police radio):
One Adam 12. See the woman?

44
00:03:26,867 --> 00:03:29,200
Man (Over police radio):
Houston, we have
a problem up here.

45
00:03:29,233 --> 00:03:30,833
Man (On radio):
It's half past the hour,

46
00:03:30,867 --> 00:03:33,533
And now time for the news
with Michael St. James.

47
00:03:33,567 --> 00:03:36,067
Man:
What do you
make of it?

48
00:03:36,100 --> 00:03:37,933
Man #2:
I don't know, Joe.

49
00:03:37,967 --> 00:03:40,800
No weapons, no motive,
no clothes.

50
00:03:40,833 --> 00:03:45,767
All we've got to go on
is this bloody corpse.

51
00:03:45,800 --> 00:03:48,267
- Well, look again, Harry.
- Huh?

52
00:03:51,833 --> 00:03:55,433
Not blood...

53
00:03:55,467 --> 00:04:00,100
Man (On radio):
Due in a large part to
a major surplus of tomatoes.

54
00:04:00,133 --> 00:04:02,767
Tomato juice.

55
00:04:02,800 --> 00:04:06,500
The tomato crop
continues to grow at
an unprecedented rate.

56
00:04:06,533 --> 00:04:08,933
Within the last 12 hours,
we have received

57
00:04:08,967 --> 00:04:12,000
A number of
unconfirmed reports
from throughout the nation

58
00:04:12,033 --> 00:04:15,867
That may or may not
be connected to
this strange phenomenon.

59
00:04:15,900 --> 00:04:17,467
Man (Voice echoing):
Hmm.

60
00:04:17,500 --> 00:04:20,000
Sure doesn't taste like
tomato juice.

61
00:04:20,033 --> 00:04:22,700
(Gulping, gagging)

62
00:04:28,500 --> 00:04:30,467
(Clattering)

63
00:04:30,500 --> 00:04:33,000
- Look at the giant
tomato, Martha.
- (Growling)

64
00:04:33,033 --> 00:04:35,867
I didn't knew
they grew 'em
so big, Jess.

65
00:04:35,900 --> 00:04:37,900
I wonder where
he's going.

66
00:04:37,933 --> 00:04:40,200
(Clattering, roaring)

67
00:04:40,233 --> 00:04:42,067
He got little Timmy.

68
00:04:42,100 --> 00:04:44,133
- Poor Timmy.
- (Slurping)

69
00:04:44,167 --> 00:04:47,867
- He ate him all up.
- (Burps, gulps)

70
00:04:47,900 --> 00:04:49,700
(Sirens wailing)

71
00:04:55,400 --> 00:04:57,233
(Gunshots)

72
00:05:25,967 --> 00:05:28,967
Man:
The tomatoes are coming!
Sheriff, they're coming!

73
00:05:29,000 --> 00:05:32,200
My God,
did you see that?
A tomato...

74
00:05:32,233 --> 00:05:34,100
You didn't see anything.
You didn't hear anything.

75
00:05:34,133 --> 00:05:36,833
- The pilot's still in there.
- Forget about the pilot.

76
00:05:36,867 --> 00:05:38,933
- Come over here!
- We can't leave him.

77
00:05:38,967 --> 00:05:41,500
It's just too incredible!
A kamikaze tomato!

78
00:05:41,533 --> 00:05:43,433
- Tomatoes can't fly!
- Yeah?

79
00:05:43,467 --> 00:05:46,867
They can't eat people either,
but they're doing one heck
of an impression.

80
00:05:46,900 --> 00:05:49,733
Jim, talk to that sheriff
and find out what's
going on.

81
00:05:49,767 --> 00:05:52,400
Get over here!
How bad is it?

82
00:05:52,433 --> 00:05:54,800
Well, sir, I definitely
don't think it'll fly again.

83
00:05:54,833 --> 00:05:57,100
I'm not talking
about that, you weiner!
What about the tomatoes.

84
00:05:57,133 --> 00:05:58,900
We found two more bodies
at the main road,

85
00:05:58,933 --> 00:06:00,800
But we pushed the tomatoes
back to the north end.

86
00:06:00,833 --> 00:06:02,800
- I don't think any
managed to bust loose.
- They better not have.

87
00:06:02,833 --> 00:06:04,767
- I want this thing contained!
- I understand, but nothing
seems to stop them.

88
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:07,067
We tried chemicals,
bugs, bullets.
Nothing seems to work.

89
00:06:11,733 --> 00:06:13,900
Look, the president
wants a complete
investigation.

90
00:06:13,933 --> 00:06:16,400
- We can't let this out.
People would...
- Panic, that's what.

91
00:06:16,433 --> 00:06:19,400
And you know whose ass
is on the line?
Yours, mine,

92
00:06:19,433 --> 00:06:21,933
- and the entire
ag department.
- Look out!

93
00:06:25,867 --> 00:06:27,633
What if the president
wants an investigation?

94
00:06:27,667 --> 00:06:29,833
He'll get his investigation,
but we'll keep it quiet.

95
00:06:29,867 --> 00:06:32,167
I've arranged for
the most obscure generals,

96
00:06:32,200 --> 00:06:35,900
The most obscure scientists,
and to head the investigation,

97
00:06:35,933 --> 00:06:38,900
- this man.
- I don't recognize him.

98
00:06:38,933 --> 00:06:41,800
Nobody does.
His name is Mason Dixon.

99
00:06:41,833 --> 00:06:43,733
He hasn't worked
since the bay of pigs.

100
00:06:43,767 --> 00:06:45,733
- Is there any sign
of a problem elsewhere?
- Not yet.

101
00:06:45,767 --> 00:06:47,900
I've ordered the entire
g.D.P. Program shut down.

102
00:06:47,933 --> 00:06:49,333
Wait a minute.

103
00:06:49,367 --> 00:06:51,667
Isn't that Jim Richardson,
the press secretary?

104
00:06:51,700 --> 00:06:53,867
- What's he doing here?
- The president's got him
keeping an eye

105
00:06:53,900 --> 00:06:55,567
On the investigation.

106
00:06:55,600 --> 00:06:56,933
- Why him?
- He's got a vegetable
garden, that's why.

107
00:06:56,967 --> 00:06:58,933
With peas and carrots
and squash and tomatoes.

108
00:06:58,967 --> 00:07:02,233
That sheriff tells me
there were reports of incidents
like this all over the county.

109
00:07:02,267 --> 00:07:04,733
Oh, bullshit.
One nut spots
a flying saucer,

110
00:07:04,767 --> 00:07:06,733
And pretty soon
everybody's shaking hands
with little green men.

111
00:07:06,767 --> 00:07:09,300
God, who would've thought.
All we wanted was a bigger,
healthier tomato.

112
00:07:09,333 --> 00:07:11,567
Look out!
Here it comes again!

113
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:15,033
Where did you get
this one, general?

114
00:07:15,067 --> 00:07:17,267
Oh, I won that one
in a three-legged sack race

115
00:07:17,300 --> 00:07:20,100
- last armed forces day
picnic.
- (Snoring)

116
00:07:20,133 --> 00:07:22,100
What's the matter with
general number two?

117
00:07:22,133 --> 00:07:24,600
Oh, he was out
all night on maneuvers.
Let him rest.

118
00:07:24,633 --> 00:07:27,700
Oh, I'm sorry
I'm late, gentlemen.
Would you follow me, please?

119
00:07:27,733 --> 00:07:30,200
Certainly.

120
00:07:30,233 --> 00:07:33,000
Oh, general, would you
wake up, please?

121
00:07:56,067 --> 00:07:58,767
I apologize for the size
of this room, gentlemen.

122
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:01,533
It's all I could do
on such short notice.

123
00:08:18,967 --> 00:08:21,033
Now, are we all here?

124
00:08:21,067 --> 00:08:23,067
- Where's Jim Richardson?
- The press secretary?

125
00:08:23,100 --> 00:08:24,633
Yes.

126
00:08:24,667 --> 00:08:26,500
Perhaps we can give him
a few more minutes.

127
00:08:26,533 --> 00:08:28,500
General, I've been
meaning to ask you,

128
00:08:28,533 --> 00:08:31,033
Have you heard anything
about the nuclear strike force

129
00:08:31,067 --> 00:08:32,800
Tactical training
command meeting?

130
00:08:32,833 --> 00:08:34,800
- You mean operation nichefict?
- That's right.

131
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:37,533
Not really. I've been
following the personnel
proficiency planning

132
00:08:37,567 --> 00:08:39,667
For pago-pago paratroop
platoon patrols.

133
00:08:39,700 --> 00:08:41,933
Oh, operation ppppp.

134
00:08:41,967 --> 00:08:44,633
- What's the poop on ppppp?
- Moving well.

135
00:08:44,667 --> 00:08:46,467
Did somebody
mention misfits?

136
00:08:46,500 --> 00:08:48,467
- No. Ppppp.
- Ah.

137
00:08:48,500 --> 00:08:50,500
Well, then, nichefict
must be pretty well
wrapped up.

138
00:08:50,533 --> 00:08:52,400
(Chattering)

139
00:09:18,600 --> 00:09:21,767
Gentlemen, gentlemen,
may I have your
attention, please?

140
00:09:21,800 --> 00:09:24,967
Now that we're all here,
I'd like to turn the meeting
over to Dr. morrison.

141
00:09:25,000 --> 00:09:26,633
- Doctor?
- Thank you, captain.

142
00:09:26,667 --> 00:09:28,000
- "Major."
- Pardon me?

143
00:09:28,033 --> 00:09:29,133
Never mind.

144
00:09:32,167 --> 00:09:34,967
Well, as I'm sure
you're well aware,

145
00:09:35,000 --> 00:09:38,467
This tomato problem has
caused considerable concern

146
00:09:38,500 --> 00:09:40,800
Within the scientific
community.

147
00:09:40,833 --> 00:09:43,900
Scientists throughout
the nation have directed
their attention

148
00:09:43,933 --> 00:09:46,167
To this very
vexing problem

149
00:09:46,200 --> 00:09:48,600
With only
limited success.

150
00:09:48,633 --> 00:09:50,433
However,

151
00:09:50,467 --> 00:09:52,900
With the help of
Dr. fuji nokitofa,

152
00:09:52,933 --> 00:09:55,633
We believe we've
made a breakthrough.

153
00:09:55,667 --> 00:09:58,067
Gentlemen, may I present
Dr. nokitofa.

154
00:09:58,100 --> 00:09:59,500
How do you do, doctor?

155
00:09:59,533 --> 00:10:01,467
Very well, thank you.

156
00:10:01,500 --> 00:10:04,500
Dr. nokitofa,
would you please explain

157
00:10:04,533 --> 00:10:07,000
The project
to the gentlemen?

158
00:10:16,833 --> 00:10:19,633
Gentlemen, what we have
developed is, in essence,

159
00:10:19,667 --> 00:10:22,733
A half-man, half-robot,
a very sophisticated

160
00:10:22,767 --> 00:10:26,467
Combination of
human intelligence
and superhuman powers

161
00:10:26,500 --> 00:10:29,533
Which we are confident
will result in the ultimate

162
00:10:29,567 --> 00:10:31,667
Destruction of the enemy.

163
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,433
Thank you,
Dr. nokitofa.

164
00:10:37,467 --> 00:10:39,933
Are there any
comments, gentlemen?

165
00:10:39,967 --> 00:10:41,967
Mr. black?

166
00:10:42,000 --> 00:10:44,867
As head of the federal
intelligence agency,

167
00:10:44,900 --> 00:10:47,367
I certainly don't mean to
question the background

168
00:10:47,400 --> 00:10:49,567
Of these fine gentlemen,

169
00:10:49,600 --> 00:10:52,333
But frankly, I don't think
the answer to this problem

170
00:10:52,367 --> 00:10:54,900
Lies in trinkets
and gadgets.

171
00:10:54,933 --> 00:10:58,467
This is man
versus vegetable.

172
00:10:58,500 --> 00:11:02,633
Technically, sir,
tomatoes are fags.

173
00:11:02,667 --> 00:11:04,900
He means "fruits."

174
00:11:04,933 --> 00:11:07,500
Ah. Fruits.

175
00:11:07,533 --> 00:11:09,367
You see what I mean?

176
00:11:09,400 --> 00:11:12,000
Mr. Dixon,
I've been authorized
to assign you

177
00:11:12,033 --> 00:11:14,533
Four of my best agents.

178
00:11:14,567 --> 00:11:17,400
Gentlemen,
with your permission,
I'd like to

179
00:11:17,433 --> 00:11:19,700
Introduce Mr. Dixon
to his operatives.

180
00:11:19,733 --> 00:11:21,700
That's fine, Mr. platt.
In the meantime,

181
00:11:21,733 --> 00:11:24,367
The rest of us will accompany
the doctors down to view
a demonstration

182
00:11:24,400 --> 00:11:26,400
Of the latest
anti-tomato project.

183
00:11:26,433 --> 00:11:28,400
We'll be going outside,
Mr. Dixon.

184
00:11:28,433 --> 00:11:29,700
You'd better bring
your coat.

185
00:11:29,733 --> 00:11:31,633
There's a little jap
in the air.

186
00:11:31,667 --> 00:11:33,500
He means "nip."

187
00:11:33,533 --> 00:11:36,400
(Music over dialogue)

188
00:11:42,033 --> 00:11:45,067
Man:
Wash, wash, wash.
Scrub, scrub, scrub.

189
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:46,800
Can you get my back?

190
00:11:53,533 --> 00:11:55,767
- (Explosion)
- (Screaming)

191
00:11:55,800 --> 00:11:59,000
- Oh, my eyes!
Oh, my eyes!
- (Alarm blaring)

192
00:11:59,033 --> 00:12:01,300
Water! Water!

193
00:12:01,333 --> 00:12:03,433
(Electricity crackling)

194
00:12:09,533 --> 00:12:11,933
Actually, gentlemen,
this project entails

195
00:12:11,967 --> 00:12:14,633
The development of limbs
with superhuman powers.

196
00:12:14,667 --> 00:12:18,000
Unfortunately,

197
00:12:18,033 --> 00:12:20,733
Budget limitations
have restricted our
development to only

198
00:12:20,767 --> 00:12:23,700
One of these
technologically
advanced legs.

199
00:12:23,733 --> 00:12:26,767
Okay, Bruce,
now let's try
running first.

200
00:12:29,433 --> 00:12:32,333
Uh, that'll be
fine, Bruce.

201
00:12:34,367 --> 00:12:36,000
Bruce,

202
00:12:36,033 --> 00:12:38,300
Please jump for us.

203
00:12:40,300 --> 00:12:41,833
(Crash)

204
00:12:44,700 --> 00:12:47,233
Despite some minor
recruitment difficulties

205
00:12:47,267 --> 00:12:49,333
Caused by our recent
p.R. Problem,

206
00:12:49,367 --> 00:12:51,333
I believe you'll find
that your unit

207
00:12:51,367 --> 00:12:54,500
Will meet the highest
of standards.

208
00:12:54,533 --> 00:12:57,300
Pynchon.

209
00:12:57,333 --> 00:13:00,400
Your men, Dixon.

210
00:13:00,433 --> 00:13:03,367
Sam Smith,
disguise expert.

211
00:13:03,400 --> 00:13:05,967
Gretta attenbaum,
swimming expert.

212
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:08,633
Gretta defected to us
after the last Olympics.

213
00:13:08,667 --> 00:13:12,333
We feel she's gonna be
quite an addition
to the department.

214
00:13:12,367 --> 00:13:16,400
Greg colburn,
underwater expert.

215
00:13:16,433 --> 00:13:19,233
The fourth member
of your unit,
lt. Finletter,

216
00:13:19,267 --> 00:13:21,633
Is winding up
his current mission.

217
00:13:21,667 --> 00:13:23,900
He'll contact you
at these coordinates.

218
00:13:23,933 --> 00:13:27,367
Expect him
at "10-100" hours.

219
00:13:27,400 --> 00:13:29,300
Good luck, Dixon.

220
00:13:46,333 --> 00:13:49,700
Can you, like,
believe how he waffles
on every issue?

221
00:13:49,733 --> 00:13:51,600
Woman #2:
Oh, right on.
We'll never have

222
00:13:51,633 --> 00:13:54,300
Another president
as bad as this one.

223
00:13:54,333 --> 00:13:56,567
(Women giggle)

224
00:13:59,133 --> 00:14:01,233
(Tomatoes gibbering)

225
00:14:10,433 --> 00:14:13,200
- (Women screaming)
- What is it? Over there!

226
00:14:18,167 --> 00:14:20,067
No! No!

227
00:14:29,200 --> 00:14:32,733
(Screaming)

228
00:14:36,767 --> 00:14:39,467
(Gibbering continues)

229
00:14:39,500 --> 00:14:42,167
Mr. Daniels,
I realize that
in the past,

230
00:14:42,200 --> 00:14:44,133
There have been
some questions raised

231
00:14:44,167 --> 00:14:46,267
Regarding the president's
use of public funds

232
00:14:46,300 --> 00:14:49,167
For what some may consider
personal items.

233
00:14:49,200 --> 00:14:52,567
However, I can say without
fear of contradiction

234
00:14:52,600 --> 00:14:55,700
That under no circumstances
and at no time

235
00:14:55,733 --> 00:14:57,767
Has the current
administration expended

236
00:14:57,800 --> 00:15:00,500
Any public monies
whatsoever

237
00:15:00,533 --> 00:15:03,800
For the purchase of
the Fluffy flower-print
toilet paper.

238
00:15:03,833 --> 00:15:06,567
Now, if there are
no further questions...

239
00:15:06,600 --> 00:15:08,167
Thank you,
Mr. press secretary.

240
00:15:08,200 --> 00:15:11,567
Mr. secretary!
Mr. secretary!

241
00:15:11,600 --> 00:15:14,400
Just a moment,
gentlemen.

242
00:15:14,433 --> 00:15:17,800
One more question.
The little fellow
in the rear.

243
00:15:17,833 --> 00:15:21,833
Bobby jenks, sir,
p.S. 149.
I have a question, sir.

244
00:15:21,867 --> 00:15:25,200
Certainly, young man.
What would you like to know?

245
00:15:25,233 --> 00:15:28,167
We've heard nothing at all
about the growing
tomato menace.

246
00:15:28,200 --> 00:15:30,533
(Reporters clamoring)

247
00:15:30,567 --> 00:15:32,467
I...

248
00:15:35,233 --> 00:15:37,367
Uh...

249
00:15:37,400 --> 00:15:40,767
Wouldn't exactly call it
a menace, young man.

250
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,533
There have been some
isolated reports

251
00:15:44,567 --> 00:15:48,233
Alleged incidents involving
some unusual activity

252
00:15:48,267 --> 00:15:50,667
Associated with this, uh,

253
00:15:50,700 --> 00:15:52,800
Particular vegetable,

254
00:15:52,833 --> 00:15:55,100
But I assure you
that, uh,

255
00:15:55,133 --> 00:15:58,233
This is not and never
will become a menace.

256
00:15:58,267 --> 00:16:01,133
However, the president,
leaving no stone unturned,

257
00:16:01,167 --> 00:16:05,433
Has called upon our most
noted congressional leaders
in this field

258
00:16:05,467 --> 00:16:08,500
To begin a thorough,
intensive, painstaking,

259
00:16:08,533 --> 00:16:10,600
And exhaustive investigation

260
00:16:10,633 --> 00:16:14,167
Into the backgrounds
and origins of this

261
00:16:14,200 --> 00:16:16,600
Interesting quirk
of nature.

262
00:16:16,633 --> 00:16:21,133
Furthermore, you can assure
all of your young readers that

263
00:16:21,167 --> 00:16:24,700
This will never become a problem
that Americans need fear.

264
00:16:28,633 --> 00:16:32,533
This, uh, meeting of
the senate investigating
committee's

265
00:16:32,567 --> 00:16:34,500
Called to order.

266
00:16:38,500 --> 00:16:42,067
Anybody remember
what we're supposed
to be investigating?

267
00:16:42,100 --> 00:16:44,567
- The tomatoes, Wayne.
- What was it?

268
00:16:44,600 --> 00:16:47,433
We're investigating
those tomatoes.

269
00:16:47,467 --> 00:16:51,067
Oh, yes, yes.
Yes, of course. Yes.

270
00:16:51,100 --> 00:16:55,067
Well, there's one for you,

271
00:16:55,100 --> 00:16:56,700
One for you,

272
00:16:56,733 --> 00:16:59,133
One here for me,

273
00:16:59,167 --> 00:17:02,000
One for you.

274
00:17:02,033 --> 00:17:04,667
There's supposed to be
one for everybody.

275
00:17:04,700 --> 00:17:07,000
Wonder where
it could be.

276
00:17:11,467 --> 00:17:14,033
(Phone rings)

277
00:17:14,067 --> 00:17:18,333
Woman:
Good morning, city herald.
May I help you?

278
00:17:18,367 --> 00:17:19,633
Roberts!

279
00:17:23,133 --> 00:17:25,400
- Sir?
- Get me Goldstein.

280
00:17:25,433 --> 00:17:27,633
- He's still
in beirut, sir.
- Beirut?

281
00:17:27,667 --> 00:17:29,233
Yes, he's fired, sir.

282
00:17:29,267 --> 00:17:31,100
Oh. Yeah.
Get me Johnson.

283
00:17:31,133 --> 00:17:34,100
Sorry, sir. He's covering
that trial in Texas.

284
00:17:34,133 --> 00:17:36,067
Oh, cripes!

285
00:17:36,100 --> 00:17:39,200
Okay, just get me anybody
in the special assignment desk.

286
00:17:39,233 --> 00:17:41,267
They're all on
special assignment.

287
00:17:41,300 --> 00:17:43,133
Goddamn it!
Who the hell is here?

288
00:17:43,167 --> 00:17:46,400
Well, uh,
there's you, sir.

289
00:17:46,433 --> 00:17:48,700
Thank you, Julius.

290
00:17:48,733 --> 00:17:51,100
Wait a minute.

291
00:17:51,133 --> 00:17:53,433
- There's Fairchild.
- Who the hell is he?

292
00:17:53,467 --> 00:17:55,300
"She." Sir.

293
00:17:55,333 --> 00:17:57,567
Lois Fairchild,
society section.

294
00:17:57,600 --> 00:17:59,867
The new kid?

295
00:17:59,900 --> 00:18:01,933
Society, huh?

296
00:18:01,967 --> 00:18:03,967
Oh, what the hell.
Send her in.

297
00:18:06,467 --> 00:18:08,433
Now, damn it!

298
00:18:09,967 --> 00:18:12,300
(Motorcycle engines revving)

299
00:18:20,267 --> 00:18:22,600
(Cheering)

300
00:18:31,333 --> 00:18:33,000
(Groaning)

301
00:18:33,033 --> 00:18:35,933
Man:
Hey, look. It's a funky
little tomato.

302
00:18:35,967 --> 00:18:39,267
(Chuckles, choking groans)

303
00:18:41,567 --> 00:18:43,467
(Screaming)

304
00:18:46,167 --> 00:18:49,267
(Siren wailing)

305
00:18:49,300 --> 00:18:51,967
- Where are we going?
- Take the old mission road.

306
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,900
Some crazy-ass biker
has got himself munched on
by a herd of tomatoes.

307
00:18:54,933 --> 00:18:57,167
- So what can we do?
- We can keep it quiet,
that's what.

308
00:18:57,200 --> 00:18:59,167
Didn't you hear
the police radio?

309
00:18:59,200 --> 00:19:01,567
It's solid tomatoes
between here and holtville.
We're liable to get killed!

310
00:19:01,600 --> 00:19:03,567
Will you can it,
you little pud-puller?

311
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:05,567
If John q. Public finds out
what's really going down,

312
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,533
We're both
as good as dead.

313
00:19:09,500 --> 00:19:11,267
Fairchild, sir.

314
00:19:11,300 --> 00:19:13,900
- Hmm?
- Fairchild.

315
00:19:13,933 --> 00:19:15,967
You sent for me?

316
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:18,433
Oh. Yeah, yeah.
Have a seat.

317
00:19:18,467 --> 00:19:21,900
Fairchild,
I've been keeping
my eye on you.

318
00:19:21,933 --> 00:19:25,533
You've got
a good sense
of organization.

319
00:19:25,567 --> 00:19:27,067
Thank you, sir.

320
00:19:27,100 --> 00:19:29,133
- Fluid style.
- Thank you, sir.

321
00:19:29,167 --> 00:19:31,533
- Sharp mind.
- Thank you, sir.

322
00:19:31,567 --> 00:19:33,367
- A nice ass.
- Thank...

323
00:19:33,400 --> 00:19:36,000
I'm about to
give you a challenge,

324
00:19:36,033 --> 00:19:37,833
Your first
big assignment,

325
00:19:37,867 --> 00:19:39,967
And I expect you
to use

326
00:19:40,000 --> 00:19:42,967
Every attribute
at your disposal.

327
00:19:43,000 --> 00:19:45,433
I'm sure that what
you lack in experience

328
00:19:45,467 --> 00:19:48,533
You'll more than
make up for in...

329
00:19:48,567 --> 00:19:50,300
Determination.

330
00:19:50,333 --> 00:19:53,100
Now,

331
00:19:53,133 --> 00:19:55,133
This will give you
the necessary background

332
00:19:55,167 --> 00:19:57,967
To handle
the assignment.

333
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,400
Go to it.

334
00:19:59,433 --> 00:20:02,233
Right away, sir.

335
00:20:02,267 --> 00:20:05,800
Uh, one more thing,
Fairchild:

336
00:20:05,833 --> 00:20:08,567
I'm certain
the government will go
to unbelievable lengths

337
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:11,500
To ensure the secrecy
of this thing.

338
00:20:11,533 --> 00:20:13,867
Good luck.

339
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:16,900
- (Siren wailing)
- (Tomatoes gibbering)

340
00:20:16,933 --> 00:20:18,833
Help! Help!

341
00:20:27,233 --> 00:20:29,133
(Gibbering)

342
00:20:29,167 --> 00:20:31,833
Do you read me?
Do you read me?

343
00:20:31,867 --> 00:20:33,967
Go away! Go away!

344
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:35,900
(Exclaiming)

345
00:20:35,933 --> 00:20:38,100
- Do you read me?
Do you read me?
- Are you happy now?

346
00:20:38,133 --> 00:20:40,867
You kept it so goddamned
secret, nobody knows
where the hell we are!

347
00:20:40,900 --> 00:20:43,067
- Do you read?
Do you read?
- Help me! S.O.S.!

348
00:20:43,100 --> 00:20:45,900
Give me that,
for Christ sake!

349
00:20:45,933 --> 00:20:48,300
You can't tell me
to shut up! I quit!

350
00:20:48,333 --> 00:20:50,167
What? You can't quit!
The department...

351
00:20:50,200 --> 00:20:52,033
Screw the department!
I'm gonna die!

352
00:20:52,067 --> 00:20:54,400
You conceited
little s.O.B.,
I'm gonna die too!

353
00:20:54,433 --> 00:20:58,767
- Good! Good!
Good, good, good...
- (Clattering)

354
00:20:58,800 --> 00:21:02,333
Not good, Mr. president.
Not good at all.

355
00:21:02,367 --> 00:21:04,333
Frankly, I was not
overly impressed

356
00:21:04,367 --> 00:21:07,867
With the level
of competency displayed
by the scientific team.

357
00:21:07,900 --> 00:21:10,400
I haven't seen Dixon's
special forces unit yet,

358
00:21:10,433 --> 00:21:13,900
But if it's anything like
what I've seen so far,

359
00:21:13,933 --> 00:21:16,167
I'd say we're in for
a bit of trouble.

360
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,867
Man:
I know what you mean, Jim.
I know what you mean.

361
00:21:18,900 --> 00:21:21,467
It's like trying
to stack bibles

362
00:21:21,500 --> 00:21:23,367
On whipped cream.

363
00:21:23,400 --> 00:21:25,767
- Yes, sir.
- Jim, an unusual problem

364
00:21:25,800 --> 00:21:27,833
Calls for
an ingenious solution.

365
00:21:27,867 --> 00:21:29,467
I think
I've got one.

366
00:21:29,500 --> 00:21:31,733
Jim, have you ever
heard of mindmaker?

367
00:21:31,767 --> 00:21:34,867
Certainly, sir.
The advertising agency
you used in your campaign.

368
00:21:34,900 --> 00:21:36,367
That's right.

369
00:21:36,400 --> 00:21:39,200
You know,
they said I'd never
get reelected,

370
00:21:39,233 --> 00:21:41,867
Especially after
it got out that I used
the statue of liberty

371
00:21:41,900 --> 00:21:44,000
As collateral
on that arab loan.

372
00:21:44,033 --> 00:21:46,400
- Yes, sir.
- But...

373
00:21:46,433 --> 00:21:50,033
I'm sitting here now,
and I owe it all
to mindmaker.

374
00:21:51,867 --> 00:21:54,833
Incidentally, Jim,
you were in the mideast
last summer.

375
00:21:54,867 --> 00:21:58,433
Tell me, how does
the old girl look
in the dead sea?

376
00:21:58,467 --> 00:22:01,167
- Just grand, sir.
- Good.

377
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:03,433
I tell you, Jim,
if those fellows
could elect me,

378
00:22:03,467 --> 00:22:06,000
- they can do anything.
- Yes, sir.

379
00:22:06,033 --> 00:22:08,700
Jim, I want you to fly
to New York immediately.

380
00:22:08,733 --> 00:22:10,733
I want you to see
Ted Swann.

381
00:22:10,767 --> 00:22:13,367
Believe me,
the man's a genius.

382
00:22:13,400 --> 00:22:14,733
I'm on my way, sir.

383
00:22:23,233 --> 00:22:25,667
That's the whole story.

384
00:22:25,700 --> 00:22:28,233
Say, would you want
to buy a used crib?

385
00:22:28,267 --> 00:22:32,200
I don't think so,
but I appreciate
this information.

386
00:22:32,233 --> 00:22:34,667
This could be
especially helpful in...

387
00:22:41,667 --> 00:22:43,967
Fairchild, from the times.

388
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,367
What's this deal
about tomatoes?

389
00:22:46,400 --> 00:22:49,733
- Look, buddy, don't try
and stonewall me.
- Man: Hi there, Lois.

390
00:22:49,767 --> 00:22:52,133
Oh. Hi, Clark.

391
00:22:54,833 --> 00:22:56,733
- What are you
doing here?
- Uh, no comment.

392
00:22:56,767 --> 00:22:58,733
- And who's he?
- No comment.

393
00:22:58,767 --> 00:23:01,633
- How serious is
this situation?
- No comment.

394
00:23:01,667 --> 00:23:04,933
- The American public
has a right to know.
- Man: Up, up, and away!

395
00:23:04,967 --> 00:23:06,800
You can't ignore
the press.

396
00:23:06,833 --> 00:23:09,233
Dixon!

397
00:23:09,267 --> 00:23:11,533
Dixon!

398
00:23:12,800 --> 00:23:15,100
Dixon!

399
00:23:15,133 --> 00:23:17,133
Dixon!

400
00:23:17,167 --> 00:23:20,167
Man (On radio):
Hey, guys, here's the song
everybody's been asking for:

401
00:23:20,200 --> 00:23:23,100
Ronny Desmond's
"puberty love."

402
00:23:23,133 --> 00:23:25,900
Man (High voice):
* puberty, puberty love

403
00:23:25,933 --> 00:23:28,167
Man:
Oh, wow,
what is that?

404
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,367
Oh, no! Don't tell me
that's the song.

405
00:23:30,400 --> 00:23:32,267
Please, oh!
Turn it off!

406
00:23:32,300 --> 00:23:35,033
Oh, it's torture on the ears!
I can't stand that noise!

407
00:23:35,067 --> 00:23:37,767
(All chattering)

408
00:23:37,800 --> 00:23:39,800
(Radio switching stations)

409
00:23:41,600 --> 00:23:43,633
(Man on radio reading news)

410
00:23:43,667 --> 00:23:45,633
Man:
Quiet! I want
to hear the news.

411
00:23:45,667 --> 00:23:47,633
Man (On radio):
And today, the president
closed the nation's

412
00:23:47,667 --> 00:23:50,700
Last remaining sub base
at groton, Connecticut.

413
00:23:50,733 --> 00:23:53,667
When asked why he had made
the startling decision,

414
00:23:53,700 --> 00:23:56,633
The president responded,
"those funny little
black ships

415
00:23:56,667 --> 00:23:59,700
Just keep sinking anyway."

416
00:23:59,733 --> 00:24:02,700
And in other news today,
in Newark, new Jersey,

417
00:24:02,733 --> 00:24:06,900
A man was eaten by a bacon,
lettuce and tomato sandwich.

418
00:24:46,667 --> 00:24:48,733
You're free!

419
00:25:21,033 --> 00:25:22,967
(Airplane passes overhead)

420
00:25:23,000 --> 00:25:26,967
Man:
Geronimo!

421
00:25:27,000 --> 00:25:28,900
(Crashing thud)

422
00:25:54,633 --> 00:25:56,800
Hmm.

423
00:25:56,833 --> 00:25:59,100
So you're
finletter, huh?

424
00:25:59,133 --> 00:26:01,533
I'm Mason Dixon,
and this is...

425
00:26:01,567 --> 00:26:05,000
My God!
It's Adolf Hitler!

426
00:26:05,033 --> 00:26:07,433
(Shouting)

427
00:26:22,933 --> 00:26:25,533
This is Sam Smith.

428
00:26:27,000 --> 00:26:31,000
He's our
undercover expert.

429
00:26:31,033 --> 00:26:34,167
He's only disguised
as Adolf Hitler.

430
00:26:34,200 --> 00:26:37,167
Guten morgen,
herr Hitler.

431
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,000
- Autobahn.
- Sprechen ze deutche?

432
00:26:40,033 --> 00:26:41,933
Weiner schnitzel.

433
00:26:45,433 --> 00:26:47,433
Get in the backseat!

434
00:26:47,467 --> 00:26:50,567
What about me, Mr. Dixon?
What about me?

435
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,467
You...

436
00:26:53,733 --> 00:26:55,400
You...

437
00:26:57,633 --> 00:26:59,700
You go disguise
yourself

438
00:26:59,733 --> 00:27:02,733
As a tomato

439
00:27:02,767 --> 00:27:05,067
And infiltrate
their camp.

440
00:27:39,600 --> 00:27:41,333
Yes.
Thank you.

441
00:27:43,533 --> 00:27:45,667
- Hi.
- Mr. Richardson
to see Mr. Swann.

442
00:27:45,700 --> 00:27:47,667
Yes, sir.
He's expecting you.

443
00:27:47,700 --> 00:27:50,000
I'll let him
know you're here.
Please have a seat.

444
00:27:52,133 --> 00:27:53,967
Mr. Swann?

445
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,933
Mr. Richardson
is here to see you.

446
00:27:58,133 --> 00:27:59,933
He'll be
right with you.

447
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:05,467
Jimbo, buddy!
How are ya?
How you doin'?

448
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,467
- Fine. I, uh...
- Super, super.

449
00:28:07,500 --> 00:28:10,400
Hey, the president
tells me you have
a situation, jimbo.

450
00:28:10,433 --> 00:28:13,300
Well, let me clue you:
You boys have come
to the right place.

451
00:28:13,333 --> 00:28:17,233
Let me give you a peek
at mindmaker in action.

452
00:28:19,067 --> 00:28:22,633
First, we have to convince
the little housewife out there

453
00:28:22,667 --> 00:28:25,067
That the tomato which
ate the family pet

454
00:28:25,100 --> 00:28:27,733
Is not dangerous,
no problem.

455
00:28:27,767 --> 00:28:30,767
Then we have to convince
local authorities

456
00:28:30,800 --> 00:28:33,633
That the thousands missing
from rural communities

457
00:28:33,667 --> 00:28:35,833
Were merely stranded
during their

458
00:28:35,867 --> 00:28:38,400
Bicentennial pilgrimage
to Philadelphia.

459
00:28:38,433 --> 00:28:39,967
No problem.

460
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:44,333
Third, the president
wants us to do this
in such a way

461
00:28:44,367 --> 00:28:47,367
That it can be covered up,
and no one will know
it ever happened.

462
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:51,433
That's no problem.
But then he wants us
to do this

463
00:28:51,467 --> 00:28:54,633
And convince
200 million Americans

464
00:28:54,667 --> 00:28:58,500
That this disaster
is actually a blessing.

465
00:28:58,533 --> 00:29:01,300
Now, that's a challenge.

466
00:29:01,333 --> 00:29:03,400
I understand
what you're saying,
Mr. Swann.

467
00:29:03,433 --> 00:29:05,867
The president is a very
demanding person.

468
00:29:05,900 --> 00:29:08,967
Sometimes he expects
the impossible.
But I don't...

469
00:29:09,000 --> 00:29:11,333
I never said "impossible,"
Richardson.

470
00:29:11,367 --> 00:29:15,500
What I said was that
it was a challenge.

471
00:29:15,533 --> 00:29:19,400
Man was put on this earth
to meet challenges,
my boy.

472
00:29:19,433 --> 00:29:21,333
You really think
you can do it?

473
00:29:21,367 --> 00:29:24,233
Can I do it?
Can I do it?

474
00:29:24,267 --> 00:29:26,500
(Maniacal laughter)

475
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,267
* some sell, some buy,
and only we know why *

476
00:29:32,300 --> 00:29:36,500
* the wrap is more important
than the prize *

477
00:29:36,533 --> 00:29:39,567
* important decisions
are made each day *

478
00:29:39,600 --> 00:29:42,500
* much too important for
the plain folk to make *

479
00:29:42,533 --> 00:29:44,200
* they're always
in a bind *

480
00:29:44,233 --> 00:29:46,800
* depend on us to help
make up their mind *

481
00:29:48,267 --> 00:29:51,433
* red box, blue box,
a red box and a blue box *

482
00:29:51,467 --> 00:29:54,267
* bright colors
and a coupon
on the side *

483
00:29:55,967 --> 00:29:58,700
* hard sell or soft sell,
it's all the same *

484
00:29:58,733 --> 00:30:01,633
* millions of dollar bills
are spent every day *

485
00:30:01,667 --> 00:30:03,467
* where do they all go?

486
00:30:03,500 --> 00:30:05,833
* mindmaker's here
to run the show *

487
00:30:10,333 --> 00:30:12,267
* we sell cars and toys
for girls and boys *

488
00:30:12,300 --> 00:30:13,700
* and chairs and beds
and shrunken heads *

489
00:30:13,733 --> 00:30:16,467
* sugar beets
and baseball cleats
and ice to eskimos *

490
00:30:16,500 --> 00:30:18,200
* leeks and mink
and boats that sink *

491
00:30:18,233 --> 00:30:21,833
* no matter what,
we'll get it sold *

492
00:30:21,867 --> 00:30:25,167
* we'll use catchy jingles,
snappy tunes and pretty girls
with big balloons *

493
00:30:25,200 --> 00:30:28,200
* a little lie,
a stretch of truth can
turn the public's head *

494
00:30:28,233 --> 00:30:30,767
* there's TV types
and ad execs and
everyone's the best *

495
00:30:30,800 --> 00:30:34,233
* and yet

496
00:30:34,267 --> 00:30:36,933
* they all look up

497
00:30:36,967 --> 00:30:40,200
* to a single man

498
00:30:40,233 --> 00:30:43,633
* and that one
single man *

499
00:30:43,667 --> 00:30:45,833
* is... me!

500
00:30:45,867 --> 00:30:48,733
(Maniacal laughter)

501
00:30:50,767 --> 00:30:53,600
* they sell, they buy,
and only I know why *

502
00:30:53,633 --> 00:30:56,367
* the human mind is
putty in my hands *

503
00:30:58,100 --> 00:31:01,133
* important decisions
are made each day *

504
00:31:01,167 --> 00:31:03,900
* much more important for
the plain folk to make *

505
00:31:03,933 --> 00:31:05,433
* they're always
in a bind *

506
00:31:05,467 --> 00:31:09,567
* depend on me to help
make up their mind *

507
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:11,767
* decision-wise

508
00:31:11,800 --> 00:31:15,200
* policy-wise,
demographically speaking *

509
00:31:15,233 --> 00:31:18,167
* mindmaker!

510
00:31:18,200 --> 00:31:21,833
Well, let's go meet
that challenge,
young man.

511
00:31:21,867 --> 00:31:24,100
I've already put
my staff to work,

512
00:31:24,133 --> 00:31:26,100
So if you'd be good enough
to stop by in the morning,

513
00:31:26,133 --> 00:31:29,100
We can take a look-see
at some of the
preliminary sketches.

514
00:31:31,133 --> 00:31:33,100
Roll it.

515
00:31:33,133 --> 00:31:35,133
Man (On recording):
Then I can tell the president
you'll accept the assignment.

516
00:31:35,167 --> 00:31:38,533
(Chuckling)
You bet your booties.

517
00:31:38,567 --> 00:31:41,467
Traffic cops
all over the country
meet this challenge

518
00:31:41,500 --> 00:31:43,533
Day to day.

519
00:31:43,567 --> 00:31:46,867
This man is like
any other policeman
anywhere in the country.

520
00:31:46,900 --> 00:31:50,167
He works hard
and takes pride
in serving people.

521
00:31:50,200 --> 00:31:52,600
Yes, he's a policeman
just like any other,

522
00:31:52,633 --> 00:31:55,400
Except for one thing:
He is blind.

523
00:31:55,433 --> 00:31:57,633
(Crashing,
tires screeching)

524
00:32:00,167 --> 00:32:02,200
Woman:
This has been
a public service announcement

525
00:32:02,233 --> 00:32:04,833
Produced for the national
health foundation.

526
00:32:04,867 --> 00:32:07,133
(Horns honking)

527
00:32:10,267 --> 00:32:12,300
(Hammer pounding)

528
00:32:16,067 --> 00:32:19,233
Sir, I really
don't think this is
a good place to camp.

529
00:32:19,267 --> 00:32:21,500
We're not sleeping
on the sidewalk.

530
00:32:21,533 --> 00:32:24,067
Do you see that big
building over there?

531
00:32:24,100 --> 00:32:26,100
It's called a hotel.

532
00:32:26,133 --> 00:32:28,533
You and I are going to
sleep in the hotel.

533
00:32:28,567 --> 00:32:30,100
No campfire, sir?

534
00:32:30,133 --> 00:32:32,200
No campfire.

535
00:32:32,233 --> 00:32:34,633
Well, then, what
am I supposed to do
with these marshmallows?

536
00:32:59,767 --> 00:33:03,200
Here's the key to my room.
I'm gonna check for messages.
Be up in a minute.

537
00:33:03,233 --> 00:33:04,967
Yes, sir.

538
00:33:15,367 --> 00:33:17,433
Pardon me.
Do you have
any messages

539
00:33:17,467 --> 00:33:20,233
For Mason Dixon
in room 401?

540
00:33:56,167 --> 00:33:58,033
Excuse me.

541
00:33:58,067 --> 00:33:59,633
May I have the key
to room 401?

542
00:33:59,667 --> 00:34:02,300
I... i seem to have
misplaced mine.

543
00:34:06,600 --> 00:34:08,733
Thank you.

544
00:34:08,767 --> 00:34:11,000
Man (On TV):
Pray-tel records
presents

545
00:34:11,033 --> 00:34:12,700
21 great dead beats.

546
00:34:12,733 --> 00:34:15,033
You get the best
of jimi hendrix,
Janis joplin,

547
00:34:15,067 --> 00:34:17,033
Otis Redding,
buddy holly,
Jim croce...

548
00:34:17,067 --> 00:34:20,967
(Switching channels)

549
00:34:21,000 --> 00:34:24,167
Man:
It's the evening news with
Charles collingsmith...

550
00:34:24,200 --> 00:34:26,400
Turn that thing off,
will ya?

551
00:34:26,433 --> 00:34:28,400
Let's get some sleep.

552
00:34:28,433 --> 00:34:30,300
Marshmallow?

553
00:34:54,933 --> 00:34:56,833
(Snoring)

554
00:35:17,600 --> 00:35:20,367
Oh. I'm...
I'm terribly sorry.

555
00:35:20,400 --> 00:35:23,133
I-I mean, I thought
this was my...

556
00:35:23,167 --> 00:35:24,900
Really. You know.

557
00:35:24,933 --> 00:35:26,867
Dixon:
What was that?

558
00:35:26,900 --> 00:35:29,967
- A strumpet, sir.
- A what?

559
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:33,400
A harlot. A trollop.
A lady of the evening.

560
00:35:33,433 --> 00:35:35,933
Go to sleep,
finletter!

561
00:35:50,333 --> 00:35:52,033
(Ringing)

562
00:36:02,033 --> 00:36:04,233
Hmm?

563
00:36:04,267 --> 00:36:07,067
Wh-what?

564
00:36:07,100 --> 00:36:09,200
Where?

565
00:36:09,233 --> 00:36:11,133
I'll be right there.

566
00:36:16,000 --> 00:36:18,400
- Breakfast, sir.
- No time!

567
00:36:18,433 --> 00:36:21,433
- But... your vitamins.
- No time!

568
00:36:21,467 --> 00:36:23,567
Now, listen.
This is important.

569
00:36:23,600 --> 00:36:27,200
You've got to go down
and warn gretta that there's
tomato activity in sector 2.

570
00:36:27,233 --> 00:36:29,867
You got that?
No matter what happens,
you tell her.

571
00:36:29,900 --> 00:36:31,533
- Yes, sir.
- Man (On radio):
We interrupt this program

572
00:36:31,567 --> 00:36:33,433
To bring you
a special bulletin.

573
00:36:33,467 --> 00:36:36,367
The following is an nbs
hotline bulletin

574
00:36:36,400 --> 00:36:38,933
With Douglas keikler
in New York.

575
00:36:38,967 --> 00:36:41,467
Nbs... the network
that brings you

576
00:36:41,500 --> 00:36:43,400
The news
as it happens,

577
00:36:43,433 --> 00:36:46,933
Brings you these bulletins
in times of emergency,

578
00:36:46,967 --> 00:36:50,533
The news you need to know
when you need to know it,
on nbs,

579
00:36:50,567 --> 00:36:53,367
The network
of the news.

580
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:56,033
This nbs news
hotline bulletin

581
00:36:56,067 --> 00:36:58,733
Is brought to you
by schritz beer.

582
00:36:58,767 --> 00:37:01,900
You're never too drunk
to ask for schritz.

583
00:37:01,933 --> 00:37:04,767
And by bright gums,
the toothpaste

584
00:37:04,800 --> 00:37:07,800
For people without
teeth or dentures.

585
00:37:07,833 --> 00:37:09,267
And by...

586
00:37:13,000 --> 00:37:15,133
(Chattering)

587
00:37:30,167 --> 00:37:32,067
(Rustling)

588
00:37:34,100 --> 00:37:36,333
What is it, spot?
What's in there?

589
00:37:36,367 --> 00:37:38,367
Spot:
Gosh, Billy,
I don't know.

590
00:37:38,400 --> 00:37:40,367
You stay there.
I'll go look.

591
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:42,767
- Spot? Spot?
- (Rustling)

592
00:37:49,800 --> 00:37:51,700
(Tomatoes gibbering)

593
00:38:04,733 --> 00:38:08,467
- What are those
red circles, sir?
- Machine gun emplacements.

594
00:38:08,500 --> 00:38:10,467
We've got the whole valley
surrounded with them.

595
00:38:10,500 --> 00:38:12,367
I don't think
we can hold them
very long, though.

596
00:38:12,400 --> 00:38:15,967
And that green line,
that's their furthest
point of advance?

597
00:38:16,000 --> 00:38:18,767
- That's right.
- Uh-huh. What are
the blue dots?

598
00:38:18,800 --> 00:38:20,900
Those are mobil stations.

599
00:38:20,933 --> 00:38:23,467
- Oh.
- (Vehicle approaching)

600
00:38:23,500 --> 00:38:25,300
That must be
major mills.

601
00:38:25,333 --> 00:38:27,033
- Take over.
- Yes, sir!

602
00:38:31,900 --> 00:38:33,967
I'm glad you could
make it, sir.

603
00:38:34,000 --> 00:38:36,833
- I think we've got something
that will interest you.
- So I've been told.

604
00:38:36,867 --> 00:38:38,667
Dixon, I want you
to see this.

605
00:38:38,700 --> 00:38:40,267
Captain?

606
00:38:40,300 --> 00:38:41,733
Yes, sir.

607
00:38:49,767 --> 00:38:51,700
(Gibbering)

608
00:38:54,933 --> 00:38:57,067
Sir,

609
00:38:57,100 --> 00:38:59,600
We've captured
a giant tomato.

610
00:39:07,300 --> 00:39:09,200
(Gibbering continues)

611
00:39:13,667 --> 00:39:16,933
I'm afraid, gentlemen,
that what we have
here before us

612
00:39:16,967 --> 00:39:19,767
Isn't what we thought.

613
00:39:19,800 --> 00:39:20,933
You don't mean...

614
00:39:20,967 --> 00:39:23,267
This,

615
00:39:23,300 --> 00:39:26,900
May God help us,

616
00:39:26,933 --> 00:39:29,000
Is a cherry tomato.

617
00:39:32,067 --> 00:39:34,800
- (Screaming)
- (Roaring)

618
00:40:00,033 --> 00:40:02,900
(Rustling)

619
00:40:02,933 --> 00:40:05,167
(Gibbering, slurping)

620
00:40:27,233 --> 00:40:29,567
(Screams)

621
00:41:05,967 --> 00:41:08,233
Mr. Dixon
has ordered me
to inform you

622
00:41:08,267 --> 00:41:10,633
That there's
tomato activity
in your sector.

623
00:41:34,567 --> 00:41:38,067
All right,
who wants to be
paper monitor?

624
00:41:42,633 --> 00:41:45,700
I'm telling you, j.B.,
it's a great idea.

625
00:41:45,733 --> 00:41:48,833
The first adult
breakfast cereal:

626
00:41:48,867 --> 00:41:50,933
Kinky crispies.

627
00:41:50,967 --> 00:41:53,267
Comes in three
delicious flavors...

628
00:41:53,300 --> 00:41:56,067
Good afternoon,
Mr. Swann.

629
00:41:56,100 --> 00:41:59,467
I'll call you back,
j.B. Bye.

630
00:41:59,500 --> 00:42:01,800
Jimbo!
How's it going?

631
00:42:01,833 --> 00:42:03,967
I believe that's
my question.

632
00:42:04,000 --> 00:42:07,467
Right. Fun-NY!
(Chuckles)

633
00:42:07,500 --> 00:42:10,233
Well, let me tell you,
we've been going
great bananas.

634
00:42:10,267 --> 00:42:13,067
Sit down, make
yourself comfortable.

635
00:42:13,100 --> 00:42:15,967
I asked myself,
"what do we need?

636
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,767
"Something original,

637
00:42:17,800 --> 00:42:20,900
Something that strikes
at the very heart
of the matter."

638
00:42:20,933 --> 00:42:23,733
And here it is!

639
00:42:23,767 --> 00:42:26,533
Mindmaker at its best!

640
00:42:26,567 --> 00:42:28,567
Who can argue
with that?

641
00:42:34,500 --> 00:42:36,900
And there's more.
Listen to this.

642
00:42:41,067 --> 00:42:44,500
Man (On recording):
Giant tomatoes mean
bigger pizzas!

643
00:42:44,533 --> 00:42:48,067
- Man #2: Rolling on 2.
- * if you're feeling
sad and blue *

644
00:42:48,100 --> 00:42:51,033
* tomatoes end it
all for you *

645
00:42:51,067 --> 00:42:53,533
Last year,
more people were killed

646
00:42:53,567 --> 00:42:56,833
By automobile accidents,
heart attacks,

647
00:42:56,867 --> 00:43:00,133
Lung cancer,
and natural causes
combined

648
00:43:00,167 --> 00:43:02,567
Than by
any one tomato.

649
00:43:02,600 --> 00:43:03,867
Pretty classy, huh?

650
00:43:03,900 --> 00:43:05,433
With a capital "k."

651
00:43:05,467 --> 00:43:07,467
Right.
And Mr. secretary,

652
00:43:07,500 --> 00:43:09,700
Being a public relations
man yourself,

653
00:43:09,733 --> 00:43:12,633
You understand
the value of symbols.

654
00:43:12,667 --> 00:43:15,933
Well, we have
spent a great deal
of time and effort

655
00:43:15,967 --> 00:43:20,533
And over a million dollars
to create a symbol
which will wage this battle,

656
00:43:20,567 --> 00:43:22,833
An effort that will
become known as

657
00:43:22,867 --> 00:43:25,833
The "stop tomato
program."

658
00:43:25,867 --> 00:43:28,067
I see.

659
00:43:28,100 --> 00:43:31,167
It all looks quite...
Extraordinary.

660
00:43:31,200 --> 00:43:33,767
- Thank you.
- Now if you'll excuse me,

661
00:43:33,800 --> 00:43:36,000
- I think I'll be
on my way.
- Just a moment.

662
00:43:36,033 --> 00:43:38,400
One more thing
before you leave,
Mr. secretary.

663
00:43:38,433 --> 00:43:40,400
I'd really like you
to see this.

664
00:43:40,433 --> 00:43:43,100
It's something
I've worked on
for many years,

665
00:43:43,133 --> 00:43:46,767
The culmination
of years of effort:

666
00:43:46,800 --> 00:43:50,400
The world's
ultimate commercial.

667
00:43:50,433 --> 00:43:52,033
Roll it.

668
00:43:52,067 --> 00:43:55,500
(Dramatic music plays)

669
00:43:55,533 --> 00:43:57,567
Man (Deep voice):
Hi.

670
00:43:57,600 --> 00:43:59,967
Jesus Christ
for technitron.

671
00:44:17,433 --> 00:44:19,733
Man (On radio):
The nation is in chaos.

672
00:44:19,767 --> 00:44:22,433
Can nothing stop
this tomato onslaught?

673
00:44:22,467 --> 00:44:24,500
Last night, tomatoes
attacked Los Angeles...

674
00:44:24,533 --> 00:44:26,500
(Screaming)

675
00:44:26,533 --> 00:44:27,733
Boston.

676
00:44:29,600 --> 00:44:31,033
Seattle.

677
00:44:32,733 --> 00:44:34,267
Chicago.

678
00:44:35,833 --> 00:44:37,800
Even the mere mention
of the word

679
00:44:37,833 --> 00:44:40,800
Is sufficient
to induce panic.

680
00:44:47,433 --> 00:44:48,967
Tomato.

681
00:44:49,000 --> 00:44:50,900
(Screaming)

682
00:45:01,100 --> 00:45:03,300
More news
at the hour.

683
00:45:03,333 --> 00:45:07,400
Now back to the rocking sound
of the boober on super 101.

684
00:45:07,433 --> 00:45:09,400
Man #2:
All right! Man, that's
really something, huh?

685
00:45:09,433 --> 00:45:12,833
Hey, everyone,
I'm gonna play something...

686
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:14,700
(Slurping, growling)

687
00:45:14,733 --> 00:45:17,400
That's right, man.
It's number one
in the charts this week...

688
00:45:17,433 --> 00:45:20,267
The heavy sound
of Ronny Desmond's
"puberty love."

689
00:45:20,300 --> 00:45:22,533
* puberty

690
00:45:22,567 --> 00:45:24,533
* puberty love

691
00:45:24,567 --> 00:45:28,367
* there is nothing like
puberty love *

692
00:45:28,400 --> 00:45:30,567
(Continues, indistinct)

693
00:45:50,467 --> 00:45:52,867
While the federal
agencies involved
have declared

694
00:45:52,900 --> 00:45:55,600
-(snoring)
- That the necessary information
has not been forwarded

695
00:45:55,633 --> 00:45:59,667
To state agencies
for their respective
review and approval,

696
00:45:59,700 --> 00:46:03,433
We cannot ignore local pleas
for inter-governmental
cooperation

697
00:46:03,467 --> 00:46:05,767
- (snoring)
- In what is obviously
an affair

698
00:46:05,800 --> 00:46:09,000
Best suited for
international actions.

699
00:46:09,033 --> 00:46:11,833
- (Snoring)
- This is a question
best left to people

700
00:46:11,867 --> 00:46:14,700
For whom there is
no spokesman greater

701
00:46:14,733 --> 00:46:17,233
Than those who speak...

702
00:46:17,267 --> 00:46:19,200
(Men snoring loudly)

703
00:46:29,233 --> 00:46:31,700
Dixon:
And then I put
my foot to the floor,

704
00:46:31,733 --> 00:46:34,600
And I got out of there
as fast as I could.

705
00:46:34,633 --> 00:46:37,900
It was all very strange.
I... i just don't know
what to think.

706
00:46:37,933 --> 00:46:41,300
You made no unusual
motions of any kind?

707
00:46:41,333 --> 00:46:43,267
Not to my knowledge.

708
00:46:43,300 --> 00:46:44,900
Odd.

709
00:46:44,933 --> 00:46:47,800
Were there any loud noises
or other extraneous activity

710
00:46:47,833 --> 00:46:49,933
Which might have affected
the tomatoes' behavior,

711
00:46:49,967 --> 00:46:52,233
Such as an airplane

712
00:46:52,267 --> 00:46:53,700
Or another car
in the vicinity?

713
00:46:53,733 --> 00:46:55,767
I'm almost sure
there wasn't.

714
00:46:55,800 --> 00:46:57,867
-(Snoring)
- If you'll excuse me,
gentlemen,

715
00:46:57,900 --> 00:47:00,233
I really have to be
getting back to Washington.

716
00:47:00,267 --> 00:47:02,333
That's fine.
Give my regards
to the president.

717
00:47:02,367 --> 00:47:05,233
- I'll do that, captain.
- It's "major."

718
00:47:05,267 --> 00:47:07,167
Of course.

719
00:47:07,200 --> 00:47:10,700
Priority-one message
for Mr. Dixon, sir.

720
00:47:10,733 --> 00:47:13,633
- A phone call for you.
- Oh, thank you.

721
00:47:13,667 --> 00:47:15,700
I'll need one of those
for my records too.

722
00:47:15,733 --> 00:47:17,867
I'll need one
for my files.

723
00:47:17,900 --> 00:47:19,867
And don't forget
the major.

724
00:47:19,900 --> 00:47:22,267
(All chattering)

725
00:47:55,300 --> 00:47:57,733
- Yeah?
- Trouble, sir.

726
00:47:57,767 --> 00:47:59,200
- Hello?
- Trouble, sir.

727
00:47:59,233 --> 00:48:00,533
Both:
What?

728
00:48:00,567 --> 00:48:02,867
I haven't seen Dixon
all day.

729
00:48:02,900 --> 00:48:06,267
I've been following
his assistant, but that's
getting me nowhere.

730
00:48:06,300 --> 00:48:08,433
- "Followed"? By who?
- Following who?

731
00:48:08,467 --> 00:48:10,267
- His assistant.
- A spy.

732
00:48:10,300 --> 00:48:12,133
- A spy?
- That's right.

733
00:48:12,167 --> 00:48:13,333
Both:
Well, what's
he look like?

734
00:48:13,367 --> 00:48:15,133
Medium height,
medium build.

735
00:48:15,167 --> 00:48:18,300
It's a "she," sir.
You know, the strumpet
last night.

736
00:48:18,333 --> 00:48:20,233
- The one with the big...
- Guns and a sword...

737
00:48:20,267 --> 00:48:21,800
- With long, blonde...
- Parachute...

738
00:48:21,833 --> 00:48:23,600
- Sunglasses...
- Combat boots...

739
00:48:23,633 --> 00:48:26,167
- And a dress.
- Nothing suspicious
about that.

740
00:48:26,200 --> 00:48:29,200
- You can't be serious.
- What shall I do?

741
00:48:29,233 --> 00:48:32,800
Look, I thought I made it
perfectly clear.

742
00:48:32,833 --> 00:48:36,300
I don't think you've made use
of all your potential,
if you know what I mean.

743
00:48:36,333 --> 00:48:38,400
Look, you're
obviously tired.

744
00:48:38,433 --> 00:48:40,200
Why don't you go
take a nap?

745
00:48:40,233 --> 00:48:43,400
- You mean, go to bed?
- I couldn't do that!

746
00:48:43,433 --> 00:48:46,433
- Why not? You're a woman.
- I resent that.

747
00:48:46,467 --> 00:48:48,800
I didn't say that
you were incompetent.

748
00:48:48,833 --> 00:48:51,267
I just think
you could use a rest.

749
00:48:51,300 --> 00:48:53,800
Yes, sir.
But i...

750
00:48:53,833 --> 00:48:57,533
Well, I'll do
my best, sir.

751
00:48:57,567 --> 00:49:00,100
- Goodbye.
- Goodbye.

752
00:49:00,133 --> 00:49:02,000
Goodbye.

753
00:49:05,433 --> 00:49:07,167
Operator?

754
00:49:07,200 --> 00:49:09,333
Operator, I, uh...
I've gotten
a wrong number.

755
00:49:09,367 --> 00:49:12,400
- I'd like my dime back.
- (High-pitched chattering)

756
00:49:25,267 --> 00:49:26,667
Hi, there.

757
00:49:26,700 --> 00:49:29,133
Hello.

758
00:49:29,167 --> 00:49:31,300
Listen,
about last night.

759
00:49:31,333 --> 00:49:34,267
It was an accident.
I really didn't mean...

760
00:49:34,300 --> 00:49:36,700
It was a dark night.
I mean,

761
00:49:36,733 --> 00:49:39,333
The lights were off,
and it got dark.

762
00:49:39,367 --> 00:49:43,733
I mean, it was dark,
and it was light earlier.

763
00:49:43,767 --> 00:49:45,667
You want to
go to bed?

764
00:49:45,700 --> 00:49:47,467
Uh, excuse me, ma'am?

765
00:49:47,500 --> 00:49:49,633
- Uh...
- I've got to go to bed.

766
00:50:47,100 --> 00:50:50,067
Newspaper editor's voice:
I don't think you've made use
of all your potential,

767
00:50:50,100 --> 00:50:51,700
If you know
what I mean.

768
00:50:51,733 --> 00:50:54,600
All your potential.
(Echoing) Potential.
Potential. Potential.

769
00:50:59,067 --> 00:51:00,933
(Clattering)

770
00:51:22,000 --> 00:51:23,567
I, uh...

771
00:51:25,400 --> 00:51:28,400
I was right.
I was right!

772
00:51:28,433 --> 00:51:31,033
A spy!
(Screams)

773
00:51:31,067 --> 00:51:32,967
(Crash)

774
00:51:34,333 --> 00:51:36,567
(Screaming)

775
00:51:45,400 --> 00:51:48,600
(Fairchild screaming)

776
00:52:20,100 --> 00:52:22,200
Did you warn gretta?

777
00:52:22,233 --> 00:52:26,267
Uh, yes, sir,
but she was
already dead.

778
00:52:26,300 --> 00:52:28,167
It figures.

779
00:52:31,000 --> 00:52:32,900
(Slurping)

780
00:53:00,867 --> 00:53:03,467
Man (Over intercom):
Attention. Attention.

781
00:53:03,500 --> 00:53:05,967
The 56th combat
support group

782
00:53:06,000 --> 00:53:07,933
Will depart
at 0900 hours.

783
00:53:07,967 --> 00:53:12,100
All 3rd division personnel
report to the 5th division
staging area.

784
00:53:12,133 --> 00:53:14,200
All 5th division
personnel report to

785
00:53:14,233 --> 00:53:16,267
The 3rd division
staging area.

786
00:53:16,300 --> 00:53:19,067
Will the driver
of tank 38421

787
00:53:19,100 --> 00:53:21,200
Please go to
the parking lot?

788
00:53:21,233 --> 00:53:23,133
Your lights are on.

789
00:53:28,067 --> 00:53:30,933
- Had a few setbacks
during the night.
- Serious?

790
00:53:30,967 --> 00:53:32,467
Well, it depends on
your point of view.

791
00:53:32,500 --> 00:53:34,967
Did you have
any relatives
in Wyoming?

792
00:53:35,000 --> 00:53:36,800
Say again?

793
00:53:36,833 --> 00:53:38,733
"Arkansas"?
Are you sure?

794
00:53:41,200 --> 00:53:42,733
Arkansas.

795
00:53:44,433 --> 00:53:46,767
Dixon:
What's the situation?

796
00:53:49,100 --> 00:53:51,400
Prime intelligence
tells us

797
00:53:51,433 --> 00:53:53,367
That the tomatoes
are amassing for
a final

798
00:53:53,400 --> 00:53:55,267
All-out attack
on the nation.

799
00:53:55,300 --> 00:53:59,000
Our top brass wants us
to concentrate our forces
here on the coast.

800
00:53:59,033 --> 00:54:01,500
If we can
hold them here,
we can win.

801
00:54:01,533 --> 00:54:04,000
- If not...
- Is there anything
I can do, major?

802
00:54:04,033 --> 00:54:06,333
Yes. The president wants
your personal report.

803
00:54:06,367 --> 00:54:08,967
Call him on the red line
at 1100 hours.

804
00:54:09,000 --> 00:54:10,833
Be back here tonight.

805
00:54:10,867 --> 00:54:12,867
We'll need every man
we can get.

806
00:54:12,900 --> 00:54:15,100
Damn it, Dixon,
this is war!

807
00:54:15,133 --> 00:54:16,767
Very good, sir.

808
00:54:20,933 --> 00:54:22,767
(Gunshot)

809
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,933
Sir, i...
I think somebody's
shooting at you.

810
00:54:26,967 --> 00:54:29,033
- Where do you think...
(Exclaims)
- (Bullet ricochets)

811
00:56:13,233 --> 00:56:15,133
So you can see,
Mr. Dixon,

812
00:56:15,167 --> 00:56:17,800
We have no choice
but to make our stand
out west.

813
00:56:17,833 --> 00:56:20,833
And I want you
to make sure that
our military people

814
00:56:20,867 --> 00:56:22,900
Out there in that region
understand and are aware

815
00:56:22,933 --> 00:56:25,200
Of their enormous
responsibility.

816
00:56:25,233 --> 00:56:27,033
I'm sure they are,
Mr. president.

817
00:56:27,067 --> 00:56:29,833
President:
By the way, have you seen
Jim Richardson out there?

818
00:56:29,867 --> 00:56:32,967
Dixon:
Just briefly.
How's the ad campaign going?

819
00:56:33,000 --> 00:56:34,767
Excellent.
My mail's running

820
00:56:34,800 --> 00:56:37,233
30 to 1 in favor
of the tomatoes.

821
00:56:37,267 --> 00:56:38,933
Terrific.

822
00:56:38,967 --> 00:56:41,333
Oh, God,
I almost forgot.

823
00:56:41,367 --> 00:56:43,233
- Shirley?
- Woman: Yes, sir?

824
00:56:43,267 --> 00:56:45,633
I want you to get
general Mitchell
on the line.

825
00:56:45,667 --> 00:56:48,267
Tell him to bomb
New York City.

826
00:56:48,300 --> 00:56:50,000
But, Mr. president,

827
00:56:50,033 --> 00:56:52,733
The tomatoes are not even
close to New York City.

828
00:56:52,767 --> 00:56:54,733
Listen, you worry
about your problems,

829
00:56:54,767 --> 00:56:56,933
And I'll worry
about mine.

830
00:56:56,967 --> 00:56:59,500
Yes, sir.

831
00:57:04,067 --> 00:57:05,833
- Is that the last pen?
- Yes, sir.

832
00:57:05,867 --> 00:57:07,667
Thank God.

833
00:57:16,267 --> 00:57:18,200
(Tomatoes slurping)

834
00:57:20,133 --> 00:57:22,300
Hey, will somebody
please pass the ketchup?

835
00:57:22,333 --> 00:57:24,667
(Angry gibbering)

836
00:57:24,700 --> 00:57:26,600
(Screams)

837
00:57:32,633 --> 00:57:34,167
As you were.

838
00:57:34,200 --> 00:57:35,767
Man:
Order, arms.

839
00:57:39,633 --> 00:57:41,700
The men look ready,
major.

840
00:57:41,733 --> 00:57:43,567
As ready as they'll
ever be, Dixon.

841
00:57:45,667 --> 00:57:46,933
You know, Dixon,

842
00:57:46,967 --> 00:57:49,533
A man stops to think
at a time like this

843
00:57:49,567 --> 00:57:51,133
About his home,

844
00:57:51,167 --> 00:57:53,833
His wife, his kids.

845
00:57:53,867 --> 00:57:56,600
- You married, major?
- No.

846
00:57:56,633 --> 00:57:58,633
Me either.

847
00:57:58,667 --> 00:58:02,567
I wonder what
the tomatoes are
thinking about right now.

848
00:58:41,267 --> 00:58:44,033
* we stopped

849
00:58:44,067 --> 00:58:48,600
* the Germans in '45

850
00:58:48,633 --> 00:58:51,033
* then we crushed

851
00:58:51,067 --> 00:58:55,467
- * the viet cong
- * almost

852
00:58:55,500 --> 00:58:59,100
* for a greater glory

853
00:58:59,133 --> 00:59:02,633
* we could
never strive *

854
00:59:02,667 --> 00:59:05,500
* this crop uprising

855
00:59:05,533 --> 00:59:09,633
* will not last long

856
00:59:12,733 --> 00:59:15,633
* ain't no time
to make a fuss *

857
00:59:15,667 --> 00:59:17,800
* we got to get
those tomatoes *

858
00:59:17,833 --> 00:59:19,833
* before they get us

859
00:59:19,867 --> 00:59:22,767
* we're gonna beat 'em,
mash 'em, squish 'em, bash 'em
in the street *

860
00:59:22,800 --> 00:59:26,433
* we're gonna kick 'em,
kick 'em, mush 'em, crush 'em
with our feet *

861
00:59:26,467 --> 00:59:31,433
* we're gonna meet them,
munch them, crunch them,
gonna stomp 'em in place *

862
00:59:31,467 --> 00:59:34,200
- yeah.
- Yeah.

863
00:59:34,233 --> 00:59:36,933
* t-o-m-a-t

864
00:59:36,967 --> 00:59:40,900
* o-e-s
tomatoes *

865
00:59:40,933 --> 00:59:44,500
* we'll squish them,
we'll mash them *

866
00:59:44,533 --> 00:59:48,167
* we'll mush them
we'll crush them *

867
00:59:48,200 --> 00:59:51,933
* we stopped to negotiate
at the first attack *

868
00:59:51,967 --> 00:59:55,467
* we gave 'em Alabama
but they gave it right back *

869
00:59:55,500 --> 00:59:58,800
* tomatoes, tomatoes

870
00:59:58,833 --> 01:00:00,500
* tomatoes

871
01:00:02,800 --> 01:00:05,700
* they said we'd live together
like sister and brother *

872
01:00:05,733 --> 01:00:09,600
* but they captured a cannery
and bottled my mother *

873
01:00:09,633 --> 01:00:12,900
* now she's at the store
and they'll soon be
back for more *

874
01:00:12,933 --> 01:00:15,000
* those tomatoes

875
01:00:15,033 --> 01:00:17,067
* tomatoes

876
01:00:46,600 --> 01:00:48,800
(Gibbering)

877
01:01:12,867 --> 01:01:14,700
(Growling)

878
01:01:20,367 --> 01:01:22,367
(Groaning)

879
01:01:34,667 --> 01:01:36,967
Male narrator:
Across the length
and breadth of the nation,

880
01:01:37,000 --> 01:01:40,967
The tomatoes continue
on their rampage
of wanton destruction,

881
01:01:41,000 --> 01:01:42,933
- burning,
- (Woman screams)

882
01:01:42,967 --> 01:01:45,600
- Pillaging,
- (Woman screams)

883
01:01:45,633 --> 01:01:48,567
- Raping.
- (Woman screams)

884
01:01:59,700 --> 01:02:03,733
- (Coughing)
- Let's shoot it from
over there, huh, bill?

885
01:02:03,767 --> 01:02:05,700
Come on
over here, lady.

886
01:02:05,733 --> 01:02:07,333
Stand by over here
for just a minute, huh?

887
01:02:07,367 --> 01:02:09,367
Okay, don't go away.

888
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,767
We start with
a tight shot, huh, bill?

889
01:02:11,800 --> 01:02:13,767
Tell me
when you're ready.

890
01:02:13,800 --> 01:02:15,700
Don't run off.

891
01:02:18,800 --> 01:02:21,667
Across this great nation,
almost everyone
has been affected

892
01:02:21,700 --> 01:02:24,367
In one way or another
by this terrible
tomato onslaught.

893
01:02:24,400 --> 01:02:26,800
- Mrs. Williams, I understand
your husband is missing.
- Yes, he is.

894
01:02:26,833 --> 01:02:28,467
- Do you think he's dead?
- Well, i...

895
01:02:28,500 --> 01:02:31,267
- Will you miss him?
Will you marry again?
- (Screaming)

896
01:02:31,300 --> 01:02:32,933
What if he's laying
in a ditch somewhere

897
01:02:32,967 --> 01:02:35,500
- with both legs broken,
calling your name?
- (Crying) Stop!

898
01:02:35,533 --> 01:02:39,400
You will have to find
another man, you know.
You're no spring chicken.

899
01:02:39,433 --> 01:02:41,300
What are you
going to do,
Mrs. Williams?

900
01:02:41,333 --> 01:02:43,533
- Can you answer my quest...
- (Wailing)

901
01:02:43,567 --> 01:02:45,500
Please look
into the camera.

902
01:02:45,533 --> 01:02:48,467
Mrs. Williams (Wailing):
Get away from me!

903
01:02:48,500 --> 01:02:51,367
Male narrator:
Last night's crushing
military defeat

904
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,600
May spell the end
for humanity.

905
01:02:53,633 --> 01:02:56,667
The shattered remnants
of a once-proud
civilization

906
01:02:56,700 --> 01:03:00,467
Lay scattered
amongst crushed spirits
and broken bodies.

907
01:03:00,500 --> 01:03:03,933
Lawlessness is rampant,
panic stalks the streets,

908
01:03:03,967 --> 01:03:05,833
And personal
grooming habits

909
01:03:05,867 --> 01:03:08,267
Have reached
an all-time low.

910
01:03:53,433 --> 01:03:55,433
(Gibbering)

911
01:04:14,300 --> 01:04:16,200
(Gibbering continues)

912
01:04:40,333 --> 01:04:42,300
Man (On radio):
I'll tell you now
what's coming up...

913
01:04:42,333 --> 01:04:44,733
It's the song that's
sweeping the country,
number one all over,

914
01:04:44,767 --> 01:04:48,267
From the west coast
to the east coast,
every coast in between...

915
01:04:48,300 --> 01:04:50,800
Yeah, that's right.
You've been asking for it,
you've been waiting for it.

916
01:04:50,833 --> 01:04:54,367
Here it is, boys and gals,
it's Ronny Desmond's
"puberty love"!

917
01:04:54,400 --> 01:04:58,600
* puberty
puberty love *

918
01:04:58,633 --> 01:05:03,167
* there is nothing like
puberty love *

919
01:05:03,200 --> 01:05:05,333
* it's so deep

920
01:05:05,367 --> 01:05:07,833
* it's so cool

921
01:05:07,867 --> 01:05:09,800
(Continues, indistinct)

922
01:05:34,100 --> 01:05:37,033
Get out of the car!
Hurry up, move!

923
01:05:48,700 --> 01:05:50,600
(Shouting)

924
01:06:00,767 --> 01:06:03,600
(Shouting continues)

925
01:06:13,467 --> 01:06:14,733
(Shouting continues)

926
01:06:26,467 --> 01:06:28,400
(Engine sputtering)

927
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:35,033
(Engine clattering violently)

928
01:06:56,433 --> 01:06:58,033
Hey!

929
01:07:03,100 --> 01:07:05,633
- Sir? Sir?
- What?

930
01:07:05,667 --> 01:07:08,167
- Sir! Sir!
- I'm driving!

931
01:07:08,200 --> 01:07:11,000
(Exclaiming)

932
01:07:13,667 --> 01:07:15,967
Dixon:
There's something wrong
with the car!

933
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:18,433
We'll get them,
finletter!

934
01:07:18,467 --> 01:07:22,433
- We can catch it, sir!
- Don't worry!

935
01:07:55,167 --> 01:07:56,833
Freeze!

936
01:08:15,500 --> 01:08:17,900
Richardson:
Good afternoon,
Mr. Dixon.

937
01:08:17,933 --> 01:08:20,267
Had a pleasant nap?

938
01:08:20,300 --> 01:08:23,400
Richardson.
I'm not surprised.

939
01:08:23,433 --> 01:08:25,200
Mr. Dixon,

940
01:08:25,233 --> 01:08:28,033
I didn't really think
you would be.

941
01:08:28,067 --> 01:08:30,033
That's why you're here.

942
01:08:30,067 --> 01:08:31,967
What do you intend
to do with me?

943
01:08:32,000 --> 01:08:34,900
Mr. Dixon,
don't be so naive.

944
01:08:34,933 --> 01:08:38,867
You are the only one
with the knowledge
that can stop me.

945
01:08:38,900 --> 01:08:40,933
Don't be a fool, Richardson.
You don't have a chance.

946
01:08:40,967 --> 01:08:45,033
You know very well
I do.

947
01:08:45,067 --> 01:08:47,267
You know,

948
01:08:47,300 --> 01:08:50,133
It's funny, Dixon.

949
01:08:52,433 --> 01:08:56,000
No man sits
closer to power

950
01:08:56,033 --> 01:08:59,200
Than the press secretary
to the president
of the United States.

951
01:09:01,500 --> 01:09:03,533
And yet
as close as it is,

952
01:09:03,567 --> 01:09:07,133
That power
is never really
within your grasp.

953
01:09:07,167 --> 01:09:09,567
It dangles
before you,

954
01:09:09,600 --> 01:09:12,933
Taunting, daring,

955
01:09:12,967 --> 01:09:14,933
Mocking your
very impotence.

956
01:09:14,967 --> 01:09:17,867
I will not be
mocked anymore!

957
01:09:17,900 --> 01:09:21,400
I will no longer give
other people's answers

958
01:09:21,433 --> 01:09:24,133
To other people's
questions.

959
01:09:24,167 --> 01:09:27,033
The answers
will be mine.

960
01:09:27,067 --> 01:09:30,133
The questions
will be mine.

961
01:09:30,167 --> 01:09:33,933
Everything
will be mine.

962
01:09:33,967 --> 01:09:36,867
It'll be glorious,
Dixon.

963
01:09:36,900 --> 01:09:39,567
It's too bad you won't
be around to see it.

964
01:09:39,600 --> 01:09:42,000
What makes you think
that you can

965
01:09:42,033 --> 01:09:45,567
Control these tomatoes
better than anyone else?

966
01:09:45,600 --> 01:09:48,067
Questions, questions.

967
01:09:48,100 --> 01:09:51,267
You missed
your calling.

968
01:09:51,300 --> 01:09:56,033
Mr. Dixon, have you
had lunch yet?

969
01:09:56,067 --> 01:09:58,867
Here.
Have a tomato.

970
01:09:58,900 --> 01:10:01,367
(Chuckles)
Don't be afraid.

971
01:10:01,400 --> 01:10:04,367
It's really quite small
and quite harmless.

972
01:10:04,400 --> 01:10:06,300
It's from
my garden.

973
01:10:09,867 --> 01:10:12,267
You might say
that I'm...

974
01:10:12,300 --> 01:10:15,300
In tune
with my tomatoes.

975
01:10:20,300 --> 01:10:22,267
At the proper time,

976
01:10:22,300 --> 01:10:24,867
When all vestiges
of authority

977
01:10:24,900 --> 01:10:26,767
Have disappeared,

978
01:10:26,800 --> 01:10:29,333
I shall charge in
on my white stallion

979
01:10:29,367 --> 01:10:31,267
And save the nation,

980
01:10:31,300 --> 01:10:33,867
Or what's left of it.

981
01:10:33,900 --> 01:10:37,933
My fellow citizens will be
eternally grateful.

982
01:10:37,967 --> 01:10:40,200
At the very least,
they'll surely choose

983
01:10:40,233 --> 01:10:42,300
My benevolent leadership

984
01:10:42,333 --> 01:10:45,100
Over the obvious
alternative.

985
01:10:47,333 --> 01:10:49,800
It shall be
my golden moment.

986
01:10:54,400 --> 01:10:56,067
But, Mr. Dixon,

987
01:10:56,100 --> 01:10:58,933
I'm afraid these are
your final moments.

988
01:10:58,967 --> 01:11:02,400
You're awfully confident
for a man who has
failed twice.

989
01:11:02,433 --> 01:11:06,067
Three times,
but who's counting?

990
01:11:06,100 --> 01:11:08,033
I don't think
you can do it.

991
01:11:08,067 --> 01:11:11,433
You know, Dixon,
you may be right.

992
01:11:11,467 --> 01:11:14,833
I've never killed
a man before.

993
01:11:14,867 --> 01:11:16,933
You may be right.

994
01:11:16,967 --> 01:11:18,933
(Door buzzer sounds)

995
01:11:20,900 --> 01:11:22,500
Who's there?

996
01:11:22,533 --> 01:11:25,667
Man:
U.P.S. Package for you.

997
01:11:28,133 --> 01:11:29,700
Come in.

998
01:11:29,733 --> 01:11:32,000
(Shot fires)

999
01:11:42,833 --> 01:11:44,867
Then again,

1000
01:11:44,900 --> 01:11:47,733
- you may be wrong.
- Wait.

1001
01:11:49,900 --> 01:11:51,867
Before you pull
that trigger,

1002
01:11:51,900 --> 01:11:53,867
Tell me how
you do it.

1003
01:11:53,900 --> 01:11:55,567
Really.

1004
01:11:56,700 --> 01:11:59,600
How melodramatic.

1005
01:11:59,633 --> 01:12:02,433
Very well.
It's really quite simple.

1006
01:12:02,467 --> 01:12:05,100
- (Footsteps running)
- You see, all I do is...

1007
01:12:05,133 --> 01:12:06,333
(Shouting)

1008
01:12:06,367 --> 01:12:10,033
(Groaning)

1009
01:12:13,800 --> 01:12:16,767
A real bad apple, sir.
It's a good thing
we got him.

1010
01:12:16,800 --> 01:12:18,900
(Exclaiming)

1011
01:12:47,067 --> 01:12:49,633
Finletter!
Finletter!

1012
01:12:49,667 --> 01:12:51,933
We've got to round up
everybody in the city.
You got that?

1013
01:12:51,967 --> 01:12:54,367
And meet me in the stadium.
There's no time to lose.

1014
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,567
But, sir,
everybody's left town.

1015
01:12:56,600 --> 01:12:58,167
The only people left
will be crazy people.

1016
01:12:58,200 --> 01:13:00,767
I don't care!
Just do it! Move!

1017
01:13:00,800 --> 01:13:02,733
Sir...

1018
01:13:22,733 --> 01:13:25,100
Then it's
unanimously agreed

1019
01:13:25,133 --> 01:13:27,100
That the committee
recommend

1020
01:13:27,133 --> 01:13:29,967
That no further action
will be taken at this time.

1021
01:13:44,600 --> 01:13:46,633
(Crowd chattering, exclaiming)

1022
01:14:27,700 --> 01:14:30,700
I've got it!

1023
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:32,967
I've got it!

1024
01:14:41,033 --> 01:14:44,833
Hey, guys, look!
They're starting to come!
They're coming!

1025
01:14:44,867 --> 01:14:47,767
(Tomatoes growling, slurping)

1026
01:15:06,900 --> 01:15:08,867
(Panicked shouting)

1027
01:15:17,233 --> 01:15:19,233
Turn on

more to say.

Bye, Mr. Dixon.

1070
01:20:41,833 --> 01:20:46,733
