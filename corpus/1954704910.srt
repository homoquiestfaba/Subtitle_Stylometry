1
00:00:51,718 --> 00:00:54,552
Looks like another
hit and run.

2
00:00:54,554 --> 00:00:58,723
Tire tracks match car
belonging to suspect

3
00:00:59,525 --> 00:01:02,427
known as one...

4
00:01:02,429 --> 00:01:04,595
Miss Henderson.

5
00:01:05,631 --> 00:01:08,366
Lucas! Breakfast!

6
00:01:14,907 --> 00:01:17,842
A nine-year-old Metro girl
has a new lease on life

7
00:01:17,844 --> 00:01:20,678
thanks to surgery at the
hospital for sick children.

8
00:01:26,552 --> 00:01:28,553
You're gonna take him
to school, right?

9
00:01:28,555 --> 00:01:32,790
What? No. Well, I told
you I've got a meeting.

10
00:01:34,059 --> 00:01:35,493
Oh, great.

11
00:01:45,637 --> 00:01:48,806
I thought we agreed you wouldn't
bring the laptop to the counter.

12
00:01:53,612 --> 00:01:55,813
No, no, no, no!
No.

13
00:01:55,815 --> 00:01:58,416
Let's go. That wasn't
finished uploading.

14
00:01:58,418 --> 00:02:02,453
You're gonna be late for school.
Come on. Let's go.

15
00:02:11,096 --> 00:02:14,399
Young grammarians.

16
00:02:14,401 --> 00:02:17,802
To conjugate,
or not to conjugate.

17
00:02:17,804 --> 00:02:21,906
That is not
the question.

18
00:02:21,908 --> 00:02:26,778
Conjugating a verb
is just very simply,

19
00:02:26,780 --> 00:02:31,049
uh, uh, uh,
creating a logical for, uh,

20
00:02:31,051 --> 00:02:34,619
uh, presentation
for as many forms

21
00:02:34,621 --> 00:02:37,055
like, I walk.
Hey!

22
00:02:37,057 --> 00:02:39,924
You walk, he walks.

23
00:02:40,859 --> 00:02:44,695
There are six tenses...

24
00:02:46,031 --> 00:02:49,834
For the English... verb

25
00:03:47,726 --> 00:03:50,246
what are you
listening to?

26
00:03:52,565 --> 00:03:56,701
I said, what are
you listening to?

27
00:03:57,736 --> 00:03:59,504
Is that chopin?

28
00:03:59,506 --> 00:04:01,606
I've been taking
cello lessons.

29
00:04:01,608 --> 00:04:03,774
I love classical.

30
00:04:18,023 --> 00:04:19,824
What are you
filming?

31
00:04:19,826 --> 00:04:22,760
Nothing. Just some
b-roll for my movie.

32
00:04:22,762 --> 00:04:23,961
Oh.

33
00:04:27,132 --> 00:04:29,567
Looks like a hit and run.

34
00:04:29,569 --> 00:04:32,170
Probably miss Henderson.

35
00:04:34,506 --> 00:04:36,073
I gotta go.

36
00:04:37,075 --> 00:04:39,356
Don't you live
over there?

37
00:06:03,295 --> 00:06:05,796
Ladies and gentlemen,
you are about to witness

38
00:06:05,798 --> 00:06:07,231
history in the making!

39
00:06:07,233 --> 00:06:10,034
And introducing the best
skater on the planet,

40
00:06:10,036 --> 00:06:11,902
Jake Simons!

41
00:06:21,046 --> 00:06:25,650
How long have you been
making these movie, Lucas?

42
00:06:25,652 --> 00:06:27,318
A while.

43
00:06:29,187 --> 00:06:32,256
What do you like about
filming funerals?

44
00:06:36,395 --> 00:06:39,130
Do you show these movies
to your parents?

45
00:06:40,065 --> 00:06:42,099
Not really.

46
00:06:42,101 --> 00:06:43,401
Why not?

47
00:06:45,003 --> 00:06:48,372
I don't think
they'd like 'em.

48
00:06:49,741 --> 00:06:52,143
What kind of movies
do you like to watch?

49
00:06:52,145 --> 00:06:53,744
The good kind.

50
00:06:53,746 --> 00:06:56,981
"Evil dead,"
"army of darkness"...

51
00:06:59,785 --> 00:07:01,085
"Psycho."

52
00:07:05,924 --> 00:07:07,291
Time up?

53
00:07:08,660 --> 00:07:10,294
I'll let you know
when we're done.

54
00:07:12,964 --> 00:07:15,966
So, what about Jake?

55
00:07:15,968 --> 00:07:19,370
What kind of movies
did he like to watch?

56
00:07:19,372 --> 00:07:22,073
How about I tell you
when we're done?

57
00:07:23,909 --> 00:07:26,043
Right about now.

58
00:09:33,573 --> 00:09:35,339
Hey, wipe your feet!

59
00:10:32,264 --> 00:10:34,298
Lucas, open the door.

60
00:10:34,300 --> 00:10:35,533
Mom, I'm changing.

61
00:10:35,535 --> 00:10:37,935
You left mud all
over the floor!

62
00:10:37,937 --> 00:10:40,371
I'll clean
it up later.

63
00:10:40,373 --> 00:10:43,274
Did you eat? There's
dinner on the table.

64
00:10:43,276 --> 00:10:45,976
Mom, I'll grab
something in a bit.

65
00:11:19,511 --> 00:11:22,146
Good morning,
sleepy head.

66
00:11:22,148 --> 00:11:24,582
Fell asleep at
your desk again?

67
00:11:24,584 --> 00:11:28,319
Come on. Oh.
Hey, hop up.

68
00:11:28,321 --> 00:11:32,690
You dad's taking you to school,
so let's go. Don't be late.

69
00:11:50,609 --> 00:11:54,278
See? What do you
think that is?

70
00:11:54,280 --> 00:11:58,482
I don't know. It's amazing what you
kids can do with your apps these days.

71
00:11:58,484 --> 00:12:00,284
That's cute.
Hey, gotta go.

72
00:12:00,286 --> 00:12:03,387
What? Hold on.
Let's roll.

73
00:12:09,394 --> 00:12:11,662
You know, It's not
such a good idea for you

74
00:12:11,664 --> 00:12:14,398
to spend so much time
staring at a computer.

75
00:12:14,400 --> 00:12:17,001
Your mom told me you fell asleep
at your desk last night.

76
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:19,003
That's not a good thing.
You're not getting your rest,

77
00:12:19,005 --> 00:12:20,571
you're not getting
your school work done.

78
00:12:20,573 --> 00:12:23,240
It's not a good thing.
Yeah, dad, but this video.

79
00:12:23,242 --> 00:12:26,176
I mean, what do
you think that is?

80
00:12:26,178 --> 00:12:29,013
I don't know.

81
00:12:29,015 --> 00:12:31,682
You ever thought about
doing something different?

82
00:12:31,684 --> 00:12:35,352
I mean, like-like, I ran into
coach Caldwell at the buy rite.

83
00:12:35,354 --> 00:12:38,222
He told me he thinks they're gonna
have a really good team this year.

84
00:12:38,224 --> 00:12:40,224
Said he'd love to have you
come and try out for the team.

85
00:12:40,226 --> 00:12:42,226
Yeah, dad,
that's not gonna happen.

86
00:12:42,228 --> 00:12:46,430
Not gonna happen,
huh? Okay.

87
00:12:46,432 --> 00:12:50,334
You just gotta realize there's more to life
than making these weird videos of yours.

88
00:12:50,336 --> 00:12:54,104
Yeah. Like skateboarding.

89
00:12:58,743 --> 00:13:00,611
The forecast,
showers heavy at times

90
00:13:00,613 --> 00:13:04,548
with occasional thunderstorms
today and a high of 89 degrees.

91
00:13:04,550 --> 00:13:07,484
Partial clearing tonight
with a low of 74.

92
00:13:07,486 --> 00:13:10,087
More showers developing
tomorrow and not as warm

93
00:13:10,089 --> 00:13:11,722
with a high of 77.

94
00:13:11,724 --> 00:13:15,726
With the winds out of the west
at 22 Miles per hour currently.

95
00:15:17,816 --> 00:15:19,783
Fourteen people arrested...

96
00:15:19,785 --> 00:15:22,419
There are more indications
that the president

97
00:15:22,421 --> 00:15:24,888
of the united
states will not...

98
00:15:24,890 --> 00:15:27,391
In Washington today
there is more likelihood

99
00:15:27,393 --> 00:15:30,861
that the budget will result
in additions to welfare.

100
00:15:30,863 --> 00:15:33,864
And the European union
is in trouble.

101
00:15:33,866 --> 00:15:38,268
There are more things
today...

102
00:15:41,841 --> 00:15:44,441
Death.
What's it like?

103
00:15:44,443 --> 00:15:47,344
We'll explore that next with
local author Chris Brighton,

104
00:15:47,346 --> 00:15:49,913
who has firsthand experience.

105
00:15:49,915 --> 00:15:53,350
He's also written a new book,
"living the now."

106
00:15:53,352 --> 00:15:56,186
Chris,
you were dead

107
00:15:56,188 --> 00:15:57,821
for nearly nine minutes.

108
00:15:57,823 --> 00:15:59,690
Yeah, so I hear.

109
00:15:59,692 --> 00:16:03,560
During those long nine
minutes, what'd you see?

110
00:16:03,562 --> 00:16:06,230
Well, you know, Paula,
I'm asked this question a lot,

111
00:16:06,232 --> 00:16:09,566
and quite frankly,
I didn't see anything.

112
00:16:09,568 --> 00:16:11,268
No white light?

113
00:16:11,270 --> 00:16:13,704
Not even the familiar face
of a deceased loved one?

114
00:16:13,706 --> 00:16:16,406
Look, you know,
everyone wants to know

115
00:16:16,408 --> 00:16:20,611
If I experienced something
amazing or even supernatural

116
00:16:20,613 --> 00:16:23,814
in my dying, and quite
frankly the answer is yes.

117
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,482
I did.
Yeah.

118
00:16:25,484 --> 00:16:27,584
But it wasn't
until I woke up.

119
00:16:27,586 --> 00:16:29,353
That's why in my new book,
"living the now,"

120
00:16:29,355 --> 00:16:30,988
I discuss the importance
of making the best of this...

121
00:16:30,990 --> 00:16:32,956
Was it quiet?

122
00:16:32,958 --> 00:16:35,893
Did you get a sense
that you wanted to stay,

123
00:16:35,895 --> 00:16:38,729
you know, dead?

124
00:16:38,731 --> 00:16:40,731
Well, Paula,
If there's no afterlife,

125
00:16:40,733 --> 00:16:42,466
why would anyone
make that choice?

126
00:16:42,468 --> 00:16:44,868
So you don't
remember anything.

127
00:16:44,870 --> 00:16:47,404
The grim reaper is
a great tour guide,

128
00:16:47,406 --> 00:16:49,706
but he doesn't let you
take pictures along the way.

129
00:16:49,708 --> 00:16:51,975
Ha! You're
funny, Chris.

130
00:16:51,977 --> 00:16:53,610
Yeah, funny.

131
00:16:53,612 --> 00:16:56,680
We'll be right back
after the break.

132
00:16:56,682 --> 00:17:00,884
Um, can I be excused?
I have homework to do.

133
00:17:00,886 --> 00:17:02,653
Sure.

134
00:17:13,965 --> 00:17:15,432
Hey, Bob.

135
00:17:15,434 --> 00:17:18,602
Hey, man. You killed
it out there today!

136
00:17:18,604 --> 00:17:20,938
Hmm, yeah, I loved
your book, by the way.

137
00:17:20,940 --> 00:17:23,640
Oh, so you read it?
Yeah, yeah, yeah.

138
00:17:23,642 --> 00:17:25,575
Most of it.
Uh-huh.

139
00:17:25,577 --> 00:17:27,778
Look, I'm sorry we didn't get
to talk about it more but,

140
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:30,714
but you know how it is,
you know, the suits upstairs,

141
00:17:30,716 --> 00:17:32,416
the ratings
and all that.

142
00:17:32,418 --> 00:17:34,017
I just thought
we had a deal.

143
00:17:34,019 --> 00:17:36,286
No dead talk,
just the book this time.

144
00:17:36,288 --> 00:17:38,755
Yeah, I know.

145
00:17:38,757 --> 00:17:42,326
Hmm. We'll catch you
on the flip side though.

146
00:18:19,364 --> 00:18:21,698
Look, I don't know
If there's a heaven or not,

147
00:18:21,700 --> 00:18:25,502
but that's just my experience,
but what I realized is that

148
00:18:25,504 --> 00:18:28,872
everyone experiences death
in one way or another.

149
00:18:28,874 --> 00:18:31,408
But that's not what
life is all about.

150
00:20:39,938 --> 00:20:44,508
A 49-year-old unidentified
man was observed last night...

151
00:20:50,781 --> 00:20:52,649
Hello?

152
00:20:52,651 --> 00:20:54,784
Police are not
releasing any information.

153
00:20:54,786 --> 00:20:57,888
You're drinking coffee?
Speaking.

154
00:20:57,890 --> 00:21:00,991
A government bill to
crack down on laboratories...

155
00:21:00,993 --> 00:21:02,792
What?

156
00:21:02,794 --> 00:21:04,828
Sure!

157
00:21:04,830 --> 00:21:07,497
Okay. Yeah.

158
00:21:07,499 --> 00:21:09,499
No, We'll-We'll be here.

159
00:21:10,835 --> 00:21:13,570
All right, all right.
We'll see you then.

160
00:21:13,572 --> 00:21:16,072
That was
the local news.

161
00:21:16,074 --> 00:21:17,841
What?

162
00:21:17,843 --> 00:21:21,545
The news. They want to interview
our son about his ghost video.

163
00:21:21,547 --> 00:21:23,880
Wait, what-what video?
Why-why would they...

164
00:21:23,882 --> 00:21:26,183
Why would they want to interview Lucas?
Lucas, what did you do?

165
00:21:26,185 --> 00:21:29,219
Nothing, mom. It was
the video I showed you.

166
00:21:31,189 --> 00:21:33,924
Well, we're
gonna be on TV.

167
00:21:33,926 --> 00:21:36,593
Isn't that
exciting?

168
00:21:38,629 --> 00:21:39,930
Hmm.

169
00:21:42,200 --> 00:21:43,767
All right, good pass.

170
00:21:43,769 --> 00:21:45,902
Nice interception.
Come on, spread it out.

171
00:21:45,904 --> 00:21:48,605
All right, let's see who's gonna
start this week. Good shot!

172
00:21:48,607 --> 00:21:50,640
Nice! Nice shot.

173
00:22:00,751 --> 00:22:03,253
So, where shall
we start?

174
00:22:03,255 --> 00:22:05,255
Hmm? The mall?

175
00:22:05,257 --> 00:22:08,191
They usually have
pretty good deals there.

176
00:22:08,193 --> 00:22:10,894
We need to get you
a new suit.

177
00:22:10,896 --> 00:22:14,898
And I can certainly use
a new dress.

178
00:22:17,336 --> 00:22:21,004
We're gonna be
on TV, Lucas!

179
00:22:21,006 --> 00:22:23,974
Aren't you the
least bit excited?

180
00:23:18,896 --> 00:23:20,664
Cute!

181
00:23:20,666 --> 00:23:23,800
Lucas, what do you
think about this one?

182
00:23:23,802 --> 00:23:26,136
Mom, I'm sure It's
just as good as

183
00:23:26,138 --> 00:23:29,205
all the other dresses
you've tried on.

184
00:23:29,207 --> 00:23:31,007
Why are you asking me?

185
00:23:38,349 --> 00:23:40,183
I like it.

186
00:23:40,185 --> 00:23:43,253
Bach's "toccata and fugue")

187
00:24:19,890 --> 00:24:21,991
Who are we
hiding from?

188
00:24:23,729 --> 00:24:26,796
You shouldn't scare
people like that.

189
00:24:26,798 --> 00:24:28,465
We have to
watch out.

190
00:24:28,467 --> 00:24:32,135
That security guard
is pure evil.

191
00:24:32,137 --> 00:24:34,204
Thanks for
the warning.

192
00:24:35,206 --> 00:24:36,973
Can we go?

193
00:24:42,413 --> 00:24:45,315
All right.

194
00:24:46,984 --> 00:24:48,918
This is exciting.

195
00:24:48,920 --> 00:24:51,354
I've never been
in a movie before.

196
00:24:55,193 --> 00:24:56,760
You ready?

197
00:24:56,762 --> 00:24:58,895
Yeah. Uh,
on one condition.

198
00:24:58,897 --> 00:25:00,897
For every question
that you ask me,

199
00:25:00,899 --> 00:25:02,399
I get to
ask you one.

200
00:25:02,401 --> 00:25:06,169
It's fine. I can
just edit you out.

201
00:25:06,171 --> 00:25:08,204
Okay.

202
00:25:08,206 --> 00:25:11,274
Chris, take one.

203
00:25:16,481 --> 00:25:18,948
Please state your name for the record.
Yes, sir.

204
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,151
Christopher
p. Brighton

205
00:25:21,153 --> 00:25:23,787
the first,
capital "c."

206
00:25:23,789 --> 00:25:25,822
Ah, go ahead.

207
00:25:25,824 --> 00:25:27,023
Are you married?

208
00:25:27,025 --> 00:25:29,025
Not anymore. You?

209
00:25:29,027 --> 00:25:32,429
Does it hurt to die?

210
00:25:32,431 --> 00:25:35,231
Uh, about as much as
falling out of a window.

211
00:25:35,233 --> 00:25:37,300
How long have you been
doing these videos?

212
00:25:37,302 --> 00:25:39,402
Since I was eight.

213
00:25:39,404 --> 00:25:42,872
Where do you think
you go when you die?

214
00:25:42,874 --> 00:25:45,542
I don't know If
you go anywhere.

215
00:25:45,544 --> 00:25:48,077
So why did you
stop playing sports

216
00:25:48,079 --> 00:25:50,113
and start hanging
around in cemeteries?

217
00:25:50,115 --> 00:25:53,550
I don't play, I document.
And that was two questions.

218
00:25:53,552 --> 00:25:56,119
My turn.
All right.

219
00:25:56,121 --> 00:25:59,122
What do you think
that thing was

220
00:25:59,124 --> 00:26:02,192
that I filmed?
Uh, a ghost?

221
00:26:03,894 --> 00:26:05,929
Look. I don't
believe in ghosts.

222
00:26:05,931 --> 00:26:08,231
Then, what do you
think it was?

223
00:26:08,233 --> 00:26:10,500
I don't know. It's a
good question though.

224
00:26:10,502 --> 00:26:13,136
And there's nothing wrong with
asking questions, you know?

225
00:26:13,138 --> 00:26:17,407
It just, sometimes you might not get
the answer that you're looking for.

226
00:26:17,409 --> 00:26:19,876
Why do you think
you came back?

227
00:26:19,878 --> 00:26:22,512
I don't know. I asked
myself that many times.

228
00:26:22,514 --> 00:26:25,181
People who believe in ghosts
think that they come back

229
00:26:25,183 --> 00:26:27,550
because they have some kind
of unfinished business.

230
00:26:27,552 --> 00:26:30,386
Do you have
unfinished business?

231
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,455
Maybe.

232
00:26:32,457 --> 00:26:35,859
Look, what I'm saying is
that sometimes things happen

233
00:26:35,861 --> 00:26:39,295
That'll make you...
Question your beliefs.

234
00:26:39,297 --> 00:26:41,197
Like that thing
that you captured,

235
00:26:41,199 --> 00:26:43,066
I don't know
what it is, but

236
00:26:43,068 --> 00:26:46,970
it certainly
makes you think.

237
00:26:50,140 --> 00:26:53,243
Well, great.
This must be

238
00:26:53,245 --> 00:26:56,179
the interview my amazing
parents scheduled for me.

239
00:26:56,181 --> 00:26:58,515
Ah. You know what?

240
00:26:58,517 --> 00:27:01,551
I've done a ton of these interviews.
Just have fun with it.

241
00:27:01,553 --> 00:27:04,621
Maybe you should do
the interview like this.

242
00:27:04,623 --> 00:27:07,223
See? Works every time.

243
00:27:08,425 --> 00:27:10,026
Hey, maybe you
can come and

244
00:27:10,028 --> 00:27:11,461
play basketball
with us.

245
00:27:11,463 --> 00:27:13,863
You know, film one of
our games or something.

246
00:27:13,865 --> 00:27:16,633
Shoot some hoops.
I'll think about it.

247
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,368
All right.

248
00:27:29,380 --> 00:27:31,881
Oh, he's always
been an artistic child.

249
00:27:31,883 --> 00:27:35,652
Creativity. You're either
born with a desire to create or

250
00:27:35,654 --> 00:27:37,587
you're not.

251
00:27:37,589 --> 00:27:40,990
Hmm.
Hmm.

252
00:27:40,992 --> 00:27:45,361
Actually, um,
I did that piece over there.

253
00:27:45,363 --> 00:27:48,232
It showed for a few weeks
at a gallery in soho.

254
00:27:48,258 --> 00:27:49,666
Oh. That's interesting.

255
00:27:49,668 --> 00:27:51,634
Thank you.

256
00:27:51,636 --> 00:27:55,371
Oh, well,
look who's home.

257
00:27:55,373 --> 00:27:56,639
Excuse me.

258
00:28:00,544 --> 00:28:02,979
Oh. Where've you been?

259
00:28:02,981 --> 00:28:04,647
Wait!

260
00:28:04,649 --> 00:28:08,284
We've been waiting for an hour, Lucas.
Where have you been?

261
00:28:08,286 --> 00:28:11,554
Uh, no, there's no time to change now.
You just gotta go.

262
00:28:11,556 --> 00:28:14,290
And Lucas, Lucas. They want us
watching from the sidelines, okay?

263
00:28:14,292 --> 00:28:17,093
I think they want
more of a one-on-one.

264
00:28:17,095 --> 00:28:19,462
Okay, go! Go.

265
00:28:19,464 --> 00:28:22,098
Oh, and Lucas.
Break a leg!

266
00:28:23,201 --> 00:28:24,634
Excuse me.

267
00:28:50,227 --> 00:28:52,295
Hi.

268
00:28:53,230 --> 00:28:55,398
You must be Lucas.

269
00:28:57,668 --> 00:28:59,469
Catherine goodwin.

270
00:28:59,471 --> 00:29:01,738
Have a seat.

271
00:29:03,207 --> 00:29:05,274
Uh...

272
00:29:08,112 --> 00:29:11,481
Okay.
And we're rolling.

273
00:29:11,483 --> 00:29:13,583
Lucas.

274
00:29:13,585 --> 00:29:15,718
Why don't we begin
with you telling us

275
00:29:15,720 --> 00:29:18,054
a little bit
about yourself.

276
00:29:18,989 --> 00:29:20,390
Hmm.

277
00:29:27,498 --> 00:29:28,998
Oh. Hi.

278
00:29:29,000 --> 00:29:30,566
H-how did he do?
How was he?

279
00:29:30,568 --> 00:29:33,503
Uh, fine, fine.
He did just fine.

280
00:29:33,505 --> 00:29:35,371
- Wonderful.
- Um...

281
00:29:35,373 --> 00:29:36,606
Listen.

282
00:29:38,275 --> 00:29:40,443
If you're thinking of doing
more of these interviews,

283
00:29:40,445 --> 00:29:42,545
may I give you a bit of advice?
Of course.

284
00:29:42,547 --> 00:29:45,314
Okay. Um...

285
00:29:45,316 --> 00:29:47,250
You might want
to consider

286
00:29:47,252 --> 00:29:49,419
taking your son
to an optometrist.

287
00:29:51,588 --> 00:29:54,657
They can do wonders
these days.

288
00:29:55,659 --> 00:29:58,027
Hmm, hmm, hmm.

289
00:29:59,496 --> 00:30:01,330
Thank you. Bye.

290
00:30:01,332 --> 00:30:03,433
Excuse me.

291
00:30:05,669 --> 00:30:08,671
You just show up
to these funerals uninvited

292
00:30:08,673 --> 00:30:11,774
to make these
videos of yours?

293
00:30:11,776 --> 00:30:13,743
What do you
call yourself?

294
00:30:13,745 --> 00:30:16,212
A funeral
crasher?

295
00:30:16,214 --> 00:30:19,716
Sometimes you
just have to steal a shot.

296
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:33,196
Lucas, that was a totally
awesome video, dude.

297
00:30:33,198 --> 00:30:35,465
You should seriously consider
joining the Sci-Fi club.

298
00:30:35,467 --> 00:30:38,234
We do a lot of paranoia stuff like this.
Hey, Lucas.

299
00:30:38,236 --> 00:30:41,237
Hey. Do I have
a ghost on my shoulder?

300
00:30:41,239 --> 00:30:42,739
Not anymore.

301
00:30:42,741 --> 00:30:44,574
He goes
to funerals.

302
00:30:44,576 --> 00:30:46,442
What a weirdo.

303
00:30:46,444 --> 00:30:48,144
He has
cross eyes.

304
00:30:48,146 --> 00:30:49,779
You think you're
a big shot now?

305
00:30:49,781 --> 00:30:53,082
You know what I think?
I think your video was a fake.

306
00:30:53,084 --> 00:30:54,317
Yeah, phony!

307
00:30:54,319 --> 00:30:56,619
Get your
eyes checked.

308
00:30:58,689 --> 00:31:00,323
Lucas Simons
is becoming

309
00:31:00,325 --> 00:31:02,225
quite a local celebrity.

310
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:05,128
His latest video, which is
being called "anyone's ghost?"

311
00:31:05,130 --> 00:31:08,164
Has surpassed three
million hits on YouTube.

312
00:31:08,166 --> 00:31:09,832
Hello?

313
00:31:09,834 --> 00:31:11,734
Friday the 12th it is.

314
00:31:11,736 --> 00:31:13,236
2:00?

315
00:31:13,238 --> 00:31:15,238
Local paranormal
filmmaker

316
00:31:15,240 --> 00:31:17,306
Lucas Simons
is here to answer

317
00:31:17,308 --> 00:31:18,875
the big question we've
all asked ourselves.

318
00:31:18,877 --> 00:31:20,476
Oh, thank you.

319
00:31:20,478 --> 00:31:22,879
Is there life
after death?

320
00:31:22,881 --> 00:31:25,481
I really don't
have any answers.

321
00:31:32,690 --> 00:31:35,291
You the man! You the man.
Right, here, right here.

322
00:31:35,293 --> 00:31:38,161
Low! You missed it.
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha.

323
00:31:38,163 --> 00:31:41,330
Lucas! Lucas!
Your movie so touched me!

324
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,534
Just one question! Lucas!
Did your video change...

325
00:31:44,536 --> 00:31:46,769
Lucas! Lucas! Big fan!
Be in my contacts!

326
00:31:46,771 --> 00:31:48,471
Please can I have
your autograph?

327
00:31:48,473 --> 00:31:51,407
Can you bring my kids back?
People want answers!

328
00:31:51,409 --> 00:31:53,476
Lucas! Lucas!

329
00:31:53,478 --> 00:31:57,713
There she is! There she is!
Mrs. Parker! Mrs. Parker!

330
00:31:57,715 --> 00:31:59,615
Are you in on this?
How do you feel about the video?

331
00:31:59,617 --> 00:32:03,186
Mrs. Parker,
what happened that day?

332
00:32:05,223 --> 00:32:07,723
Mrs. Parker!
Mrs. Parker!

333
00:32:07,725 --> 00:32:09,492
Leave the dead alone!

334
00:32:09,494 --> 00:32:11,761
Leave the dead alone!
That's right!

335
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:14,597
Leave the dead alone!
They're people too!

336
00:32:19,536 --> 00:32:22,271
What do you
think it was?

337
00:32:22,273 --> 00:32:24,407
I have my theories.

338
00:32:24,409 --> 00:32:26,309
Care to share?

339
00:32:26,311 --> 00:32:28,511
Not really.

340
00:32:30,714 --> 00:32:33,850
Aren't you supposed to be
the expert on everything?

341
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:37,320
Well... If you're
a religious person

342
00:32:37,322 --> 00:32:39,522
you could say It's
her husband's soul.

343
00:32:39,524 --> 00:32:41,858
I'm not religious.

344
00:32:41,860 --> 00:32:43,693
Are your parents?

345
00:32:43,695 --> 00:32:46,529
Not anymore.

346
00:32:46,531 --> 00:32:48,297
What do they think
of the video?

347
00:32:48,299 --> 00:32:51,367
It's the best thing that's
ever happened to them.

348
00:32:51,369 --> 00:32:53,502
What makes
you say that?

349
00:32:53,504 --> 00:32:55,972
My mom just
loves all the attention

350
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:59,842
and my dad's convinced
we're all gonna be rich.

351
00:32:59,844 --> 00:33:01,644
Well...

352
00:33:01,646 --> 00:33:03,846
Maybe they're just
excited for you.

353
00:33:03,848 --> 00:33:06,549
Nice of them
to care now.

354
00:33:30,507 --> 00:33:32,975
Look at his eye.

355
00:33:32,977 --> 00:33:34,610
He looks like
a zombie.

356
00:33:36,847 --> 00:33:38,614
Zombie squirrel?

357
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,584
That would make
the best movie ever.

358
00:33:41,586 --> 00:33:45,888
"Attack of the zombie squirrels!
Now in theaters."

359
00:33:45,890 --> 00:33:49,025
"Zombie squirrels from Mars."

360
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,493
Yeah.

361
00:33:52,663 --> 00:33:54,697
You're kind of
famous now.

362
00:33:54,699 --> 00:33:57,566
Yeah. It's weird.

363
00:33:57,568 --> 00:33:59,535
Do you think
it was a ghost?

364
00:33:59,537 --> 00:34:02,271
I don't know. Maybe.

365
00:34:02,273 --> 00:34:05,641
Well, be careful of
that zombie squirrel.

366
00:34:05,643 --> 00:34:08,978
It might come back
to life and bite you!

367
00:34:51,955 --> 00:34:56,359
Man to man defense!
Who's on him? Good shot.

368
00:34:56,361 --> 00:34:58,527
Pass it back.
Find your man.

369
00:34:58,529 --> 00:35:01,964
Find your man. Come on,
pass it around, pass it around.

370
00:35:01,966 --> 00:35:03,933
Nice! Nice!
Stay with it!

371
00:35:03,935 --> 00:35:05,868
Yeah!

372
00:35:05,870 --> 00:35:07,803
Good job, guys!

373
00:35:07,805 --> 00:35:09,839
That was an excellent practice.
Put it in there.

374
00:35:09,841 --> 00:35:11,907
Next week we're gonna
work on fundamentals.

375
00:35:11,909 --> 00:35:14,844
Oh, come on!

376
00:35:14,846 --> 00:35:17,646
All right, "team" on three.
One, two, three!

377
00:35:17,648 --> 00:35:19,115
Team!

378
00:35:19,117 --> 00:35:21,984
That's better.
Get out of here. Hey.

379
00:35:24,622 --> 00:35:27,890
You know, I'm not
a famous director or anything,

380
00:35:27,892 --> 00:35:30,393
but I think in order to
capture some really good shots,

381
00:35:30,395 --> 00:35:33,629
I think you need to take
the lens cap off of the camera.

382
00:35:33,631 --> 00:35:34,497
Funny.

383
00:35:36,401 --> 00:35:38,534
How's my favorite
celebrity?

384
00:35:38,536 --> 00:35:41,637
It's kind of
weird being famous.

385
00:35:41,639 --> 00:35:43,639
This one lady
tried to pay me

386
00:35:43,641 --> 00:35:45,541
to bring back
her dead turtle.

387
00:35:45,543 --> 00:35:47,777
Hoo-hoo. How's your
parents doing?

388
00:35:47,779 --> 00:35:49,412
What about them?

389
00:35:49,414 --> 00:35:51,981
Well, you never really
talk about 'em that much.

390
00:35:51,983 --> 00:35:54,016
Surely all of
this media attention

391
00:35:54,018 --> 00:35:56,152
is having some
effect on them too.

392
00:35:56,154 --> 00:35:57,753
Who cares how they're
dealing with it?

393
00:35:57,755 --> 00:36:00,689
Okay. I'm sorry.
I didn't mean to upset you.

394
00:36:00,691 --> 00:36:02,625
I never wanted this
kind of attention.

395
00:36:02,627 --> 00:36:04,693
Let's just
leave it at that.

396
00:36:04,695 --> 00:36:06,429
All right.
Fair enough.

397
00:36:10,867 --> 00:36:12,101
I don't play.

398
00:36:13,637 --> 00:36:15,798
Come on,
take a shot.

399
00:36:17,775 --> 00:36:22,111
Well, you're never gonna know
unless you give it a try.

400
00:36:26,616 --> 00:36:30,019
Oh, boy.
All right.

401
00:36:30,021 --> 00:36:32,488
Told you,
I suck.

402
00:36:32,490 --> 00:36:35,724
Yeah, that wasn't great.
Look, first of all,

403
00:36:35,726 --> 00:36:39,028
I want you to
do this. Okay?

404
00:36:39,030 --> 00:36:41,564
And second of all,
take that jacket off.

405
00:36:41,566 --> 00:36:44,934
Too tight for
you anyways.

406
00:36:46,203 --> 00:36:48,037
Here you go.

407
00:36:53,176 --> 00:36:54,877
Whew.

408
00:36:57,714 --> 00:36:58,881
Boy.

409
00:37:00,150 --> 00:37:03,752
Well, Rome wasn't
built in day.

410
00:37:03,754 --> 00:37:05,154
One more.

411
00:37:05,156 --> 00:37:08,190
That was pretty good.

412
00:37:08,192 --> 00:37:11,227
You know, I like how you get better
and better when you're doing things.

413
00:37:11,229 --> 00:37:14,530
That's something you should,
you know, take to heart.

414
00:37:14,532 --> 00:37:17,600
First you were one out of fifty,
and then one out of ten.

415
00:37:17,602 --> 00:37:20,469
That's pretty good.

416
00:37:22,173 --> 00:37:23,606
Oh.

417
00:37:25,108 --> 00:37:27,042
I gotta go.

418
00:37:27,044 --> 00:37:28,978
All right. Hey.

419
00:37:28,980 --> 00:37:30,880
I expect you to play
next Saturday.

420
00:37:30,882 --> 00:37:32,081
Maybe.

421
00:37:34,184 --> 00:37:34,884
Maybe.

422
00:37:38,788 --> 00:37:42,558
Oh. The phone has been
ringing off the hook.

423
00:37:46,763 --> 00:37:50,499
Okay, so I have scheduled
a few more interviews

424
00:37:50,501 --> 00:37:53,169
for next week,
I hope that's okay.

425
00:37:53,171 --> 00:37:55,538
Do I even have a choice?

426
00:37:56,139 --> 00:37:57,840
What?

427
00:38:05,882 --> 00:38:09,218
Look, son. I know this
is a lot to take on.

428
00:38:09,220 --> 00:38:12,121
But this, this is
a good thing for us.

429
00:38:12,123 --> 00:38:14,256
We-we could
use the money.

430
00:38:19,796 --> 00:38:22,865
Ha-ha-ha-ha!

431
00:39:15,118 --> 00:39:18,187
So, Lucas,
your previous works suggest

432
00:39:18,189 --> 00:39:21,790
a profound fascination
with the afterlife.

433
00:39:21,792 --> 00:39:25,928
Have you ever considered
exploring a lighter genre?

434
00:39:25,930 --> 00:39:28,297
Well, Leslie...

435
00:39:29,766 --> 00:39:31,634
May I call
you Leslie?

436
00:39:34,904 --> 00:39:37,673
So, Lucas, where do you
get your inspiration from?

437
00:39:38,808 --> 00:39:40,342
What?

438
00:39:40,344 --> 00:39:42,978
I can't hear you!

439
00:39:42,980 --> 00:39:45,614
You know,
death, It's,

440
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:48,183
It's no more
a mystery than life.

441
00:39:48,185 --> 00:39:50,953
Why are we here
other than

442
00:39:50,955 --> 00:39:53,789
a hot pastrami sandwich,
Beethoven's fifth?

443
00:39:53,791 --> 00:39:58,027
It's-It's all
suffering and misery.

444
00:40:13,276 --> 00:40:15,678
Don't ask me
a question like that!

445
00:40:15,680 --> 00:40:17,179
I'm not biting!

446
00:40:17,181 --> 00:40:19,248
You can't make me
dance to your tune!

447
00:40:19,250 --> 00:40:21,283
I'm not a monkey!

448
00:40:23,386 --> 00:40:26,922
Why are we so worried about
learning about death

449
00:40:26,924 --> 00:40:30,326
when we haven't even
figured out life?

450
00:40:30,328 --> 00:40:31,193
What made...

451
00:40:31,195 --> 00:40:32,828
What?

452
00:40:35,699 --> 00:40:40,069
So, why funerals?
Why the cemetery?

453
00:40:40,071 --> 00:40:42,671
Haven't you heard?

454
00:40:42,673 --> 00:40:44,807
People are just

455
00:40:44,809 --> 00:40:46,975
dying to get in there.

456
00:40:52,749 --> 00:40:54,016
Anybody in there?

457
00:40:57,054 --> 00:40:58,754
Yeah.

458
00:41:02,392 --> 00:41:03,792
Yes!

459
00:41:03,794 --> 00:41:04,960
Ahh.

460
00:41:04,962 --> 00:41:06,762
Way to go!

461
00:41:06,764 --> 00:41:10,065
You're getting better!
One out of seven that time.

462
00:41:10,067 --> 00:41:12,868
I guess I don't
totally suck.

463
00:41:12,870 --> 00:41:15,237
Get on defense.

464
00:41:18,375 --> 00:41:21,009
Hey, you are quite
the performer, you know that?

465
00:41:21,011 --> 00:41:24,012
I've been checking out your
interviews. They are hilarious.

466
00:41:24,014 --> 00:41:25,881
I didn't know
you were into acting.

467
00:41:25,883 --> 00:41:27,883
I was trying to
have fun with it.

468
00:41:27,885 --> 00:41:30,352
Yeah?
Make it bearable.

469
00:41:30,354 --> 00:41:32,354
Well, fame comes
and goes pretty quick.

470
00:41:32,356 --> 00:41:34,723
Maybe your 15 minutes
are almost up.

471
00:41:34,725 --> 00:41:37,159
I hope so.

472
00:41:56,913 --> 00:41:59,982
I cannot believe he
said that!

473
00:41:59,984 --> 00:42:01,817
Oh!

474
00:42:01,819 --> 00:42:03,952
What's going on? Lucas?

475
00:42:03,954 --> 00:42:06,455
Come here, honey.
Come on. Sit down.

476
00:42:06,457 --> 00:42:10,392
We have a surprise
for you.

477
00:42:13,363 --> 00:42:15,998
We're going to
New York City.

478
00:42:16,000 --> 00:42:17,099
Why?
Huh?

479
00:42:17,101 --> 00:42:18,000
Wait. There's
one more thing.

480
00:42:18,002 --> 00:42:19,282
Hold on.

481
00:42:21,070 --> 00:42:24,106
Ta-da!

482
00:42:24,108 --> 00:42:26,809
What is that?
It's for New York!

483
00:42:26,811 --> 00:42:30,045
You're gonna be on "good morning
usa" and you need a new costume.

484
00:42:30,047 --> 00:42:31,780
Mom, I don't wanna
go to New York.

485
00:42:31,782 --> 00:42:36,218
Son, you've just
been booked on national TV.

486
00:42:36,220 --> 00:42:38,554
I thought we were done
with all these interviews.

487
00:42:38,556 --> 00:42:41,457
I'm not going to New York.
I don't wanna go!

488
00:42:41,459 --> 00:42:45,260
Whoa, Whoa. Excuse me, sir,
but we already told them

489
00:42:45,262 --> 00:42:49,398
that we would be there, so you
are going, and that is final.

490
00:43:03,980 --> 00:43:06,381
Good morning, usa.
I'm Julian Peters.

491
00:43:06,383 --> 00:43:08,050
And I'm
Carson Dale.

492
00:43:08,052 --> 00:43:09,885
Our first
guest today is

493
00:43:09,887 --> 00:43:12,488
child viral sensation
Lucas Simons.

494
00:43:12,490 --> 00:43:15,190
He has the viral world
at storm about

495
00:43:15,192 --> 00:43:17,593
his new video called
"anyone's ghost?"

496
00:43:17,595 --> 00:43:20,395
So here he is,
Lucas Simons.

497
00:43:20,397 --> 00:43:22,898
Lucas, let's get
right into it.

498
00:43:22,900 --> 00:43:24,399
How did you
fake the video?

499
00:43:24,401 --> 00:43:26,535
I mean,
it looks so real.

500
00:43:26,537 --> 00:43:30,506
You must be the youngest p.T.
Barnum the world has ever seen.

501
00:43:30,508 --> 00:43:33,208
Lucas, tell us how in the
world you, at 11 years old,

502
00:43:33,210 --> 00:43:36,011
have been able to fool
scholars and scientists

503
00:43:36,013 --> 00:43:39,848
the world at large into thinking
this is anything but a giant hoax.

504
00:43:39,850 --> 00:43:42,150
It's not a hoax.

505
00:43:42,152 --> 00:43:44,953
Okay, well,
Lucas, your video

506
00:43:44,955 --> 00:43:48,023
has now surpassed
ten million hits.

507
00:43:48,025 --> 00:43:50,425
So If the video
is real,

508
00:43:50,427 --> 00:43:52,747
what do you think it was
that you captured?

509
00:43:58,536 --> 00:44:00,202
Lucas, you with us?

510
00:44:02,572 --> 00:44:03,505
Lucas?

511
00:44:23,093 --> 00:44:27,262
There he goes, off to
create his next masterpiece.

512
00:44:27,264 --> 00:44:30,332
And we can't wait to see that one too.
We'll be right back.

513
00:44:31,534 --> 00:44:34,937
You stop right there,
young man!

514
00:44:34,939 --> 00:44:37,239
What do you think
you're doing?

515
00:44:37,241 --> 00:44:39,074
Don't you dare
ruin this for us!

516
00:44:39,076 --> 00:44:40,642
Maybe It's time
that we give Lucas

517
00:44:40,644 --> 00:44:43,345
a little break from
these interviews.

518
00:44:54,057 --> 00:44:56,325
Come on, son,
it'll be all right.

519
00:44:59,062 --> 00:45:01,096
- You're pushing him.
- Oh, me?

520
00:45:01,098 --> 00:45:03,198
You're the one who jumped
at the first opportunity.

521
00:45:03,200 --> 00:45:04,700
Oh, yeah,
this was my idea.

522
00:45:04,702 --> 00:45:07,202
You're the one telling
him that we need money!

523
00:45:07,204 --> 00:45:10,405
Money? Have you seen our bills?
His funeral isn't even paid for!

524
00:45:10,407 --> 00:45:12,641
Are you seriously
bringing that up right now?

525
00:45:12,643 --> 00:45:14,688
Who's all this for? I
mean, It's not for Lucas.

526
00:45:14,714 --> 00:45:15,711
Okay, this is about me?

527
00:45:15,713 --> 00:45:18,580
Well, have you seen the interviews?
You-you eat up the attention.

528
00:45:18,582 --> 00:45:22,417
Well, what do you expect me to do?
Just go back to the way things were?

529
00:45:22,419 --> 00:45:24,653
Look, this isn't
what he needs!

530
00:45:24,655 --> 00:45:27,189
Maybe he needs a father who'll
sit down and talk to him!

531
00:45:27,191 --> 00:45:29,458
Oh, yeah, yeah.
You're mother of the year.

532
00:45:29,460 --> 00:45:32,127
Look, you don't have
a monopoly on grief!

533
00:45:32,129 --> 00:45:33,629
Nobody's talking
about that!

534
00:45:33,631 --> 00:45:36,098
You're not
the only one!

535
00:45:36,100 --> 00:45:38,533
I just can't handle this, Roger.
I can't. I'm done.

536
00:45:38,535 --> 00:45:41,236
Okay? I'm done!
Bitch.

537
00:46:10,233 --> 00:46:14,336
I've never heard them
fight like that before.

538
00:46:14,338 --> 00:46:17,105
You think they're
gonna split up?

539
00:46:17,107 --> 00:46:19,174
Well, parents
fight sometimes.

540
00:46:19,176 --> 00:46:23,445
Doesn't always mean
they're gonna get a divorce.

541
00:46:23,447 --> 00:46:25,280
I hate them.

542
00:46:25,282 --> 00:46:27,482
Come on.
You don't hate them.

543
00:46:27,484 --> 00:46:30,318
Brussels sprouts you hate,
your parents not so much.

544
00:46:32,488 --> 00:46:35,323
I can understand that
you're angry with them.

545
00:46:35,325 --> 00:46:38,593
I mean, they certainly aren't gonna
win any parent of the year awards.

546
00:46:38,595 --> 00:46:41,563
Win? They wouldn't
even be nominated.

547
00:46:44,268 --> 00:46:47,602
Look, Lucas, It's not
always easy being a parent.

548
00:46:47,604 --> 00:46:51,073
You know? Sometimes you just
do the best that you can.

549
00:46:51,075 --> 00:46:54,443
How would you know? You've
never even been a parent.

550
00:47:02,186 --> 00:47:06,655
Look. It's okay to be mad.

551
00:47:06,657 --> 00:47:09,524
But the important thing
you need to learn how to do

552
00:47:09,526 --> 00:47:12,194
is to forgive.

553
00:47:12,196 --> 00:47:14,796
Sometimes that's
the only thing you can do.

554
00:47:17,768 --> 00:47:20,602
And If you can't do that,
It's hard to move on.

555
00:48:45,689 --> 00:48:47,522
Lucas?

556
00:48:49,626 --> 00:48:52,327
Son, we've been worried.

557
00:48:52,329 --> 00:48:56,531
Your father's out
looking for you right now.

558
00:48:56,533 --> 00:48:59,334
Come here.

559
00:49:06,843 --> 00:49:09,611
Do you remember
that time you

560
00:49:09,613 --> 00:49:12,314
fell into the lake
trying to feed the ducks?

561
00:49:13,951 --> 00:49:16,218
I almost had
a heart attack.

562
00:49:20,289 --> 00:49:22,858
And then
Jake got all mad

563
00:49:22,860 --> 00:49:24,926
because he jumped
in for no reason.

564
00:49:24,928 --> 00:49:27,329
Yeah.

565
00:49:29,665 --> 00:49:32,500
I think he thought
you were gonna drown.

566
00:49:34,203 --> 00:49:36,271
It's not that deep.

567
00:49:43,913 --> 00:49:46,214
I miss him
too, mom.

568
00:49:47,950 --> 00:49:49,684
I know.

569
00:49:51,654 --> 00:49:53,755
I'm so sorry.

570
00:49:55,958 --> 00:49:58,493
And I love you
so much.

571
00:50:19,950 --> 00:50:22,617
Hi, you've reached Claudia.
And Drake.

572
00:50:22,619 --> 00:50:24,619
Sorry we can't
get to the phone right now,

573
00:50:24,621 --> 00:50:27,322
but please leave us a message
and We'll call you right back.

574
00:50:27,324 --> 00:50:29,858
Have a nice day!

575
00:52:03,886 --> 00:52:07,088
Oh! It's Halloween!

576
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,858
I forgot it was
Halloween!

577
00:52:09,860 --> 00:52:13,094
Just a minute. Have I
got something for you.

578
00:52:13,096 --> 00:52:15,030
Just a minute!
Wait right here.

579
00:52:15,032 --> 00:52:18,767
Ah, here!
Look what we have here!

580
00:52:18,769 --> 00:52:20,635
Ah.

581
00:52:20,637 --> 00:52:23,571
Let's see If we can
feed the skeleton.

582
00:52:23,573 --> 00:52:25,373
Can we?

583
00:52:25,375 --> 00:52:29,144
There it goes.

584
00:52:29,146 --> 00:52:32,247
Oh, he'll be full now!

585
00:52:38,120 --> 00:52:40,088
Oh, um, I'm...

586
00:52:40,090 --> 00:52:42,424
Looking for
Susan Parker.

587
00:52:42,426 --> 00:52:45,160
It's Sam now.
Who are you?

588
00:54:03,072 --> 00:54:04,973
Mrs. Parker?

589
00:54:09,145 --> 00:54:11,513
What brings you here?

590
00:54:11,515 --> 00:54:13,581
Making another movie?

591
00:54:13,583 --> 00:54:17,685
I... I really just came
here to say I'm sorry.

592
00:54:17,687 --> 00:54:19,521
Oh.

593
00:54:19,523 --> 00:54:21,823
So you're sorry now,
are you?

594
00:54:33,736 --> 00:54:36,704
What you filmed,

595
00:54:36,706 --> 00:54:40,208
what you captured
was extraordinary.

596
00:54:42,011 --> 00:54:44,112
I believe it was real.

597
00:54:46,081 --> 00:54:50,285
But it belonged to me,
and you, you ruined it.

598
00:54:50,287 --> 00:54:53,821
I didn't... What were you doing
filming my husband's funeral anyway?

599
00:54:53,823 --> 00:54:57,292
I was just... I know you like
filming other people's funerals.

600
00:54:58,794 --> 00:55:01,095
So I guess you just like
other people's pains.

601
00:55:01,097 --> 00:55:03,198
Is that it?

602
00:55:03,200 --> 00:55:05,066
What you did...

603
00:55:06,202 --> 00:55:09,671
Turned my grief
into a, a joke.

604
00:55:13,576 --> 00:55:16,277
I know you're just a child so I
guess that you're just too young

605
00:55:16,279 --> 00:55:18,880
to understand
this kind of pain.

606
00:55:18,882 --> 00:55:20,882
Look,
Mrs. Parker.

607
00:55:20,884 --> 00:55:24,886
Just because I'm a kid doesn't
mean I don't understand pain.

608
00:55:29,291 --> 00:55:32,560
I lost my older
brother, okay?

609
00:55:32,562 --> 00:55:34,329
He was my
best friend.

610
00:55:36,131 --> 00:55:40,001
Out family used to be happy,
but when he died,

611
00:55:40,003 --> 00:55:42,003
everything changed.

612
00:55:44,106 --> 00:55:46,674
I miss him every day.

613
00:55:46,676 --> 00:55:51,279
And sometimes... I wish
I would have died, and not him.

614
00:55:54,751 --> 00:55:58,920
I didn't mean to turn
his funeral into a joke.

615
00:55:58,922 --> 00:56:01,889
It sucks! So many people
have said so many bad things

616
00:56:01,891 --> 00:56:04,959
about you,
and I am sorry.

617
00:56:04,961 --> 00:56:08,363
That's the only reason
why I wanted to come here.

618
00:56:12,101 --> 00:56:13,601
Lucas?

619
00:56:22,077 --> 00:56:24,979
Martin's in
a better place now.

620
00:56:24,981 --> 00:56:27,348
That's what
I've come to believe.

621
00:56:27,350 --> 00:56:29,751
What I've accepted.

622
00:56:29,753 --> 00:56:33,621
I'm starting to move
on with my life now.

623
00:56:34,823 --> 00:56:37,225
So...

624
00:56:37,227 --> 00:56:39,694
Maybe It's time
that you did the same.

625
00:56:52,708 --> 00:56:54,842
I'm sorry about
your brother, man.

626
00:56:58,347 --> 00:57:01,182
I know what It's like
to lose someone you love.

627
00:57:02,785 --> 00:57:05,420
I just...
Don't know how.

628
00:57:07,923 --> 00:57:09,757
Well, what
do you mean?

629
00:57:12,027 --> 00:57:13,895
I miss him
every day.

630
00:57:13,897 --> 00:57:17,165
I just don't know
how to move on.

631
00:57:21,203 --> 00:57:23,271
It's tough.

632
00:57:28,077 --> 00:57:31,346
You're never gonna stop missing
the ones that you love.

633
00:57:31,348 --> 00:57:35,249
You're always gonna wish you
can go back and change things.

634
00:57:37,453 --> 00:57:40,121
But at some point,

635
00:57:40,123 --> 00:57:42,790
you pick up the pieces

636
00:57:42,792 --> 00:57:45,293
and you just start
living again.

637
00:57:50,265 --> 00:57:53,334
What'd your family
used to do for fun?

638
00:58:00,476 --> 00:58:03,344
Dad used to take us
to the amusement park.

639
00:58:04,913 --> 00:58:09,484
One time, mom threw up
on the tilt-a-whirl.

640
00:58:09,486 --> 00:58:12,153
Jake never
let her forget that.

641
00:58:20,429 --> 00:58:22,930
I like go-carts.

642
00:58:28,037 --> 00:58:29,370
I'm right
behind you!

643
00:58:38,815 --> 00:58:41,783
Aah! What? What?

644
00:58:56,032 --> 00:58:59,066
Well, you know what?
You cheated.

645
00:58:59,068 --> 00:59:01,436
No way. I beat
you by a mile.

646
00:59:01,438 --> 00:59:03,070
Hmm.

647
00:59:09,311 --> 00:59:11,813
Hey, Lucas, with all your
new found fame and fortune,

648
00:59:11,815 --> 00:59:14,015
you must be beating the
ladies off with a stick.

649
00:59:14,017 --> 00:59:15,316
No!

650
00:59:17,352 --> 00:59:21,289
Well, there is
this one girl.

651
00:59:22,891 --> 00:59:25,226
I knew it! Name!

652
00:59:26,495 --> 00:59:29,230
Kimberly, but
she's just a friend.

653
00:59:29,232 --> 00:59:31,399
Mm-hmm!

654
00:59:33,470 --> 00:59:35,937
She's actually
kind of cool.

655
00:59:35,939 --> 00:59:38,840
We both like a lot
of the same things.

656
00:59:38,842 --> 00:59:43,010
I was thinking about asking her
to the dance, but I don't know.

657
00:59:43,012 --> 00:59:46,814
What? Go for it.
How?

658
00:59:46,816 --> 00:59:49,217
Just call her up.

659
00:59:49,219 --> 00:59:52,854
I'm not a big phone person.
Plus, she lives just next door.

660
00:59:52,856 --> 00:59:56,390
That makes it easy. Just go
up to her and ask her out.

661
00:59:56,392 --> 00:59:59,961
Okay, look,
here's what you do.

662
00:59:59,963 --> 01:00:02,530
Throw some rocks at her window,
and then when she opens it

663
01:00:02,532 --> 01:00:05,233
you throw in a paper airplane
with a note that Says,

664
01:00:05,235 --> 01:00:07,134
"will you go to
the dance with me?"

665
01:00:07,136 --> 01:00:10,204
No. And that's
vandalism.

666
01:00:10,206 --> 01:00:11,839
All right.

667
01:00:11,841 --> 01:00:13,841
Well, think
of something.

668
01:00:13,843 --> 01:00:15,843
You're
creative.

669
01:00:15,845 --> 01:00:18,312
Just make it
your own.

670
01:01:46,101 --> 01:01:48,302
Chris! She said yes!

671
01:01:48,304 --> 01:01:50,104
Way to go!

672
01:01:50,106 --> 01:01:52,106
Wait. Do you even
know how to dance?

673
01:01:52,108 --> 01:01:53,641
Huh?

674
01:01:55,377 --> 01:01:58,279
Come on.

675
01:02:05,421 --> 01:02:08,255
All right. Let's see
your moves, kid.

676
01:02:14,630 --> 01:02:17,131
Okay, stop. You look
like you're in pain.

677
01:02:17,133 --> 01:02:19,266
Is that the robot?
Yeah.

678
01:02:19,268 --> 01:02:21,435
What's-what's wrong
with his arm?

679
01:02:21,437 --> 01:02:24,205
It was broken?
It's the dance.

680
01:02:24,207 --> 01:02:26,974
Why is the robot on the dance
floor with a broken arm?

681
01:02:26,976 --> 01:02:29,210
He should be at a robot
shop being repaired.

682
01:02:29,212 --> 01:02:32,179
Look. Okay.
You're too stiff.

683
01:02:32,181 --> 01:02:35,983
You gotta loosen up
a little bit, okay?

684
01:02:35,985 --> 01:02:38,285
Get some soul into it.

685
01:02:38,287 --> 01:02:40,488
Yeah, move your body.

686
01:02:40,490 --> 01:02:42,189
Just have fun with it.

687
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,291
You got to feel the
music all through you.

688
01:02:44,293 --> 01:02:47,061
Okay, now look.
This is you.

689
01:02:49,064 --> 01:02:51,565
It's like you're driving
a stagecoach or something.

690
01:02:51,567 --> 01:02:54,468
No, you gotta feel the music.
Okay? You can't be shy.

691
01:02:54,470 --> 01:02:56,737
At the dance
you gotta...

692
01:02:56,739 --> 01:02:58,139
Foom!

693
01:02:58,141 --> 01:02:59,540
See that?

694
01:03:00,742 --> 01:03:03,377
That's really good!

695
01:03:03,379 --> 01:03:05,660
All right, come on.
Keep it going.

696
01:03:07,315 --> 01:03:09,684
Okay, you know, I think I
know what our problem is.

697
01:03:09,686 --> 01:03:13,320
Our music choice. What kind of
music do you usually listen to?

698
01:03:13,322 --> 01:03:14,722
Classical.

699
01:03:14,724 --> 01:03:17,324
Classical?

700
01:03:17,326 --> 01:03:19,460
You can't dance
to classical.

701
01:03:19,462 --> 01:03:21,228
I don't plan
on dancing.

702
01:03:21,230 --> 01:03:24,532
Wait, wait, wait.
I think I got an idea.

703
01:03:35,378 --> 01:03:36,811
Dad?
What?

704
01:03:36,813 --> 01:03:39,246
Can you help me
with this tie?

705
01:03:39,248 --> 01:03:41,248
Yeah. Sure.

706
01:03:41,250 --> 01:03:43,217
All right.

707
01:03:43,219 --> 01:03:46,287
Big night for
my little man, huh?

708
01:03:46,289 --> 01:03:49,323
Measure it off
right where you want it.

709
01:03:49,325 --> 01:03:51,826
Should come down to just
the top of your belt buckle.

710
01:03:51,828 --> 01:03:56,230
Now, under, around.
This is a half windsor.

711
01:04:00,335 --> 01:04:01,836
And through.

712
01:04:04,139 --> 01:04:05,806
There you go.

713
01:04:05,808 --> 01:04:07,808
Symmetrical knot.

714
01:04:11,246 --> 01:04:13,614
There you go.
Thanks.

715
01:04:13,616 --> 01:04:15,449
You're welcome.

716
01:04:40,108 --> 01:04:42,143
I like your outfit.

717
01:04:42,145 --> 01:04:45,112
It's different.
It's cool.

718
01:04:45,114 --> 01:04:47,848
Thanks.
It's very "nosferatu."

719
01:04:57,259 --> 01:04:59,727
Those guys
are jerks.

720
01:04:59,729 --> 01:05:02,363
It's okay.
Wanna dance?

721
01:05:02,365 --> 01:05:03,798
Sure.

722
01:05:38,867 --> 01:05:40,768
This music sucks!

723
01:05:40,770 --> 01:05:44,505
Yeah, principal worley's
a horrible d.J.

724
01:05:46,374 --> 01:05:48,475
Hold on. I got it.

725
01:06:44,833 --> 01:06:45,966
Pff!

726
01:07:08,857 --> 01:07:10,357
Hmm.

727
01:07:11,826 --> 01:07:13,027
Hmm.

728
01:07:23,805 --> 01:07:25,806
Honey,
this is terrible.

729
01:07:25,808 --> 01:07:27,708
I know.
Whoa.

730
01:07:27,710 --> 01:07:29,944
The spice cap
fell off.

731
01:07:29,946 --> 01:07:31,578
I can tell.

732
01:07:41,724 --> 01:07:43,757
Oh, my gosh!

733
01:07:43,759 --> 01:07:46,660
I wonder how
the dance is going.

734
01:07:46,662 --> 01:07:49,563
Oh. I can't believe
Lucas went to a dance.

735
01:07:49,565 --> 01:07:51,899
With a date!
With a date!

736
01:07:51,901 --> 01:07:54,501
You know, I think he's
getting better. Hmm?

737
01:07:54,503 --> 01:07:57,504
Yeah. The other day I was watching
a basketball game. Mm-hmm.

738
01:07:57,506 --> 01:08:00,541
He walks in the room and he makes
a comment about the point guard.

739
01:08:00,543 --> 01:08:02,876
No! Believe me, I was
as shocked as you.

740
01:08:02,878 --> 01:08:06,580
Hmm.

741
01:08:08,717 --> 01:08:11,418
We got a great kid.

742
01:08:12,354 --> 01:08:13,721
Yeah.

743
01:08:21,096 --> 01:08:23,497
I love that version
of Beethoven.

744
01:08:23,499 --> 01:08:25,566
It's a very modern take.

745
01:08:25,568 --> 01:08:28,769
Maybe you could learn
to play it on your cello.

746
01:08:30,438 --> 01:08:32,439
Yeah, I was...

747
01:08:32,441 --> 01:08:34,975
Kind of thinking about
giving up the cello.

748
01:08:35,910 --> 01:08:37,378
I suck.

749
01:08:40,782 --> 01:08:43,450
Vell, you know
what zey say.

750
01:08:43,452 --> 01:08:46,086
Transylvania vas not
built in a day!

751
01:09:07,976 --> 01:09:10,878
Chris! You'll
never believe it.

752
01:09:12,380 --> 01:09:14,882
Beethoven's fifth
was a total hit.

753
01:09:16,518 --> 01:09:17,885
Chris?

754
01:09:19,688 --> 01:09:21,155
Chris!

755
01:09:24,859 --> 01:09:27,027
Nurse, what do
we have here?

756
01:09:27,029 --> 01:09:29,630
Male, mid-forties.
Ultra panic state.

757
01:09:29,632 --> 01:09:31,632
Stay calm.

758
01:09:31,634 --> 01:09:34,735
We have a heart attack.

759
01:09:59,695 --> 01:10:02,162
Dr. albanson, 204.

760
01:10:17,712 --> 01:10:19,953
He's right there.
Chris!

761
01:10:20,682 --> 01:10:23,684
Are you okay?
What happened?

762
01:10:23,686 --> 01:10:25,819
Oh, don't worry.

763
01:10:25,821 --> 01:10:29,556
Everything's fine.
I-I'm gonna be okay.

764
01:10:29,558 --> 01:10:32,926
I found you on the floor.
I thought you were gonna die.

765
01:10:32,928 --> 01:10:35,729
Yeah, well,
thanks to you, I didn't.

766
01:10:35,731 --> 01:10:37,498
What's wrong with you?

767
01:10:37,500 --> 01:10:40,234
Well, the way the doctors
explained it to me is that,

768
01:10:40,236 --> 01:10:43,804
um, I have a weak heart.

769
01:10:43,806 --> 01:10:45,472
They said It's the reason
I almost died before.

770
01:10:45,474 --> 01:10:48,242
I guess I've just been
living on borrowed time.

771
01:10:48,244 --> 01:10:50,577
Why didn't you
tell me before?

772
01:10:50,579 --> 01:10:53,981
Well, that's not something
I wanted to focus on.

773
01:10:53,983 --> 01:10:57,050
Hey, did you call your parents
and let 'em know where you are?

774
01:10:57,952 --> 01:10:59,686
Okay, good.

775
01:10:59,688 --> 01:11:01,255
So how was the dance?

776
01:11:01,257 --> 01:11:04,591
But, you're gonna
be okay, right?

777
01:11:04,593 --> 01:11:08,028
Yeah. Well, thanks to you
I got a third chance.

778
01:11:08,030 --> 01:11:11,532
So about
the dance, what happened?

779
01:11:12,767 --> 01:11:14,568
Well...

780
01:11:14,570 --> 01:11:16,603
Is-is everything okay?

781
01:11:16,605 --> 01:11:17,738
Hi.

782
01:11:18,940 --> 01:11:20,674
Hi.

783
01:11:20,676 --> 01:11:22,142
You're Chris?

784
01:11:22,144 --> 01:11:24,778
Mmm.

785
01:11:24,780 --> 01:11:27,881
Uh, well, Lucas has,
he's told us a little about you.

786
01:11:27,883 --> 01:11:29,917
Oh. It's nice
to meet you folks.

787
01:11:29,919 --> 01:11:32,286
I'm sorry it couldn't be
under better circumstances.

788
01:11:32,288 --> 01:11:34,621
Oh, no, It's...

789
01:11:34,623 --> 01:11:37,858
Lucas, honey, we should probably go.
I'm sure Chris is tired.

790
01:11:37,860 --> 01:11:39,960
But, I wanna
stay with Chris.

791
01:11:39,962 --> 01:11:42,805
No, no. You should go
with your parents, buddy.

792
01:11:42,831 --> 01:11:43,956
I'll be all right.

793
01:12:04,586 --> 01:12:05,786
Mmm.

794
01:12:11,593 --> 01:12:13,327
I love you.

795
01:12:20,168 --> 01:12:22,135
Good night, son.

796
01:12:37,752 --> 01:12:40,254
We're here to see
Chris Brighton.

797
01:12:40,256 --> 01:12:41,688
Hmm.

798
01:12:44,192 --> 01:12:47,694
Oh, I'm sorry.
Mr. Brighton was never admitted.

799
01:12:47,696 --> 01:12:50,697
It looks like he was
released to hospice care.

800
01:12:50,699 --> 01:12:52,032
What's that?

801
01:12:53,334 --> 01:12:55,969
Oh, honey,
it just means

802
01:12:55,971 --> 01:12:58,939
he went to a different
kind of hospital.

803
01:13:00,642 --> 01:13:02,209
Come on.

804
01:13:11,319 --> 01:13:12,819
Lucas.

805
01:13:13,855 --> 01:13:15,155
Sweetheart.

806
01:13:17,859 --> 01:13:21,161
No matter what happens
to your friend Chris...

807
01:13:22,630 --> 01:13:25,932
You're not alone, okay?

808
01:13:28,803 --> 01:13:31,071
Buddy, I'm here.

809
01:13:31,073 --> 01:13:33,640
Your dad's here.

810
01:13:33,642 --> 01:13:36,143
We're a family and we're
gonna stay that way,

811
01:13:36,145 --> 01:13:38,145
I promise you that.

812
01:13:40,882 --> 01:13:42,983
He's dying,
isn't he?

813
01:14:47,749 --> 01:14:50,417
No flip book
today, Lucas?

814
01:14:50,419 --> 01:14:51,918
Nope.

815
01:14:52,854 --> 01:14:56,123
Just me.

816
01:14:56,125 --> 01:14:58,125
Anything
on your mind?

817
01:15:04,065 --> 01:15:06,767
I'm mad at
my friend Chris.

818
01:15:06,769 --> 01:15:08,435
He's a liar.

819
01:15:08,437 --> 01:15:12,205
Why do you say
he's a liar?

820
01:15:14,008 --> 01:15:17,144
He always talks about living

821
01:15:17,146 --> 01:15:19,513
when he's actually dying.

822
01:15:21,182 --> 01:15:25,385
So you think he should focus
on the fact that he's dying?

823
01:15:28,856 --> 01:15:30,957
I guess you have a point.

824
01:15:40,868 --> 01:15:41,768
Go right
there, okay?

825
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:45,205
Hey! Lucas!

826
01:15:45,207 --> 01:15:47,874
Long time no see.

827
01:15:47,876 --> 01:15:50,277
How've you been, buddy?

828
01:15:50,279 --> 01:15:52,245
I've been good.

829
01:15:52,247 --> 01:15:55,115
I'm glad you came by.

830
01:15:57,452 --> 01:16:00,420
Lucas, I have some things
I wanted to tell you.

831
01:16:02,323 --> 01:16:04,925
I haven't been
totally honest with you.

832
01:16:04,927 --> 01:16:07,194
Well, what do you mean?

833
01:16:09,430 --> 01:16:11,832
I never told you
about my son.

834
01:16:11,834 --> 01:16:14,334
You have a kid?

835
01:16:14,336 --> 01:16:17,370
Well, he's not
a kid anymore.

836
01:16:17,372 --> 01:16:19,906
He's in college now.

837
01:16:19,908 --> 01:16:22,909
And I haven't seen
him in a long time.

838
01:16:24,011 --> 01:16:25,846
Why not?

839
01:16:25,848 --> 01:16:28,348
Well, I sort
of blew it

840
01:16:28,350 --> 01:16:30,470
when he was
a child.

841
01:16:31,953 --> 01:16:34,354
I got married
pretty young.

842
01:16:34,356 --> 01:16:36,857
I wasn't ready
to be a father.

843
01:16:38,459 --> 01:16:41,394
My ex-wife,
she moved away.

844
01:16:41,396 --> 01:16:44,064
And eventually we
just lost contact.

845
01:16:44,066 --> 01:16:46,967
Don't you try
to talk to him?

846
01:16:46,969 --> 01:16:48,969
Oh, yeah,
I've tried.

847
01:16:48,971 --> 01:16:50,937
I've tried.

848
01:16:52,173 --> 01:16:54,508
I don't think he's ever
gonna forgive me.

849
01:16:54,510 --> 01:16:58,178
And quite frankly I don't,
I don't blame him.

850
01:16:58,180 --> 01:17:00,580
Well, you shouldn't
give up.

851
01:17:02,116 --> 01:17:04,351
And sometimes...

852
01:17:04,353 --> 01:17:07,587
Maybe you just have to
forgive yourself.

853
01:17:08,523 --> 01:17:10,190
Right.

854
01:17:14,061 --> 01:17:16,997
So what
have you been up to?

855
01:17:16,999 --> 01:17:19,633
I've been thinking.

856
01:17:19,635 --> 01:17:22,002
About what?

857
01:17:22,004 --> 01:17:25,272
I'd like to...
Reinvent myself.

858
01:17:25,274 --> 01:17:28,475
Oh, really?
As a director?

859
01:17:29,510 --> 01:17:32,012
And I need your help.

860
01:17:32,014 --> 01:17:33,480
Okay.

861
01:17:33,482 --> 01:17:36,349
Do you have
a crew this time?

862
01:17:39,087 --> 01:17:41,368
All right,
tell me more.

863
01:18:52,293 --> 01:18:54,294
A great man
once told me,

864
01:18:54,296 --> 01:18:57,097
life is all about
living the now.

865
01:18:57,099 --> 01:18:59,399
At least, that's what
I think he was saying.

866
01:19:00,968 --> 01:19:03,036
Whoo!

867
01:19:05,039 --> 01:19:08,675
Life is made up of a series
of magical moments.

868
01:19:08,677 --> 01:19:13,046
Some we understand
and others we don't.

869
01:19:13,048 --> 01:19:16,683
Bad things happen, and
that's just a part of it all.

870
01:19:16,685 --> 01:19:20,053
The important thing is not
to dwell on those bad things,

871
01:19:20,055 --> 01:19:22,022
and move on.

872
01:19:22,024 --> 01:19:23,690
Just keep living and...

873
01:19:23,692 --> 01:19:25,725
Focus on...

874
01:19:25,727 --> 01:19:27,160
Life.

875
01:20:20,514 --> 01:20:22,382
You did so good.

876
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:24,784
I have to say bye to Chris.
Okay.

877
01:20:26,253 --> 01:20:27,654
Hey.

878
01:20:28,756 --> 01:20:31,057
I really loved
the movie.

879
01:20:31,059 --> 01:20:33,827
Thanks. It-It's
just a rough cut.

880
01:20:33,829 --> 01:20:35,829
Yeah.

881
01:20:35,831 --> 01:20:39,566
Yeah, well,
I think It's great.

882
01:20:39,568 --> 01:20:41,801
Oh, and by the way, I thought
you might like to know

883
01:20:41,803 --> 01:20:43,803
that my son called
me the other day.

884
01:20:43,805 --> 01:20:46,072
How'd that go?

885
01:20:46,074 --> 01:20:49,275
Well, Rome wasn't
built in a day.

886
01:20:52,580 --> 01:20:55,415
Lucas, you-you got
a real talent, man.

887
01:20:57,818 --> 01:21:01,387
Don't ever stop
seeking the truth, okay?

888
01:21:01,389 --> 01:21:04,157
'Cause nobody
has all the answers.

889
01:21:05,626 --> 01:21:08,461
We're just trying to
do the best we can.

890
01:21:10,865 --> 01:21:13,700
Everyone deals with death
in their own way.

891
01:21:15,336 --> 01:21:17,203
And letting go...

892
01:21:17,205 --> 01:21:19,239
Is the hard part.

893
01:21:20,841 --> 01:21:23,409
I know
your brother Jake

894
01:21:23,411 --> 01:21:26,246
meant the
world to you.

895
01:21:26,248 --> 01:21:29,716
You're never gonna
stop missing him.

896
01:21:29,718 --> 01:21:33,520
And that memory is gonna
always be a part of you.

897
01:21:33,522 --> 01:21:35,789
And that's okay.

898
01:21:35,791 --> 01:21:38,424
Because it just
means that Jake

899
01:21:38,426 --> 01:21:41,127
will always be
a part of you.

900
01:21:43,130 --> 01:21:45,665
But you can't
stop living

901
01:21:45,667 --> 01:21:47,908
when bad things
happen.

902
01:21:48,903 --> 01:21:50,603
Because...

903
01:21:50,605 --> 01:21:54,240
Every experience
is precious.

904
01:21:55,743 --> 01:21:58,912
And every experience,
it ultimately ends.

905
01:22:01,382 --> 01:22:03,783
And that's life.

906
01:22:03,785 --> 01:22:06,186
That's life, buddy.

907
01:22:07,488 --> 01:22:09,255
I...

908
01:22:09,257 --> 01:22:11,391
I don't want
you to die.

909
01:22:14,762 --> 01:22:17,797
You got your whole
life ahead of you.

910
01:22:17,799 --> 01:22:19,799
Your whole life.

911
01:22:21,769 --> 01:22:24,671
I'm just glad that
I got to be a part of it.

912
01:22:26,473 --> 01:22:27,941
Thank you.
