Jesus Christ.

3
00:01:13,147 --> 00:01:15,980
I wore that in here?

4
00:01:16,050 --> 00:01:18,075
No wonder they threw
the book at me.

5
00:01:18,152 --> 00:01:21,178
Rules, honey.
You wear it in, you wear it out.

6
00:01:21,255 --> 00:01:23,189
What's wrong with it?

7
00:01:30,365 --> 00:01:32,299
Un-fuckin'-believable.

8
00:01:34,068 --> 00:01:37,060
One, two, one, two!

9
00:01:38,306 --> 00:01:40,240
- Okay, ladies.
- Shut up.

10
00:01:40,308 --> 00:01:43,334
- Settle down.
- Shut up!

11
00:01:48,983 --> 00:01:50,575
Shut up!

12
00:01:53,755 --> 00:01:57,020
- Knock it oft!
- <i>Good-bye, Gloria</i>

13
00:01:57,091 --> 00:02:00,754
<i>We hate to see you go</i>

14
00:02:16,811 --> 00:02:18,870
Knock it oft!

15
00:02:18,946 --> 00:02:20,937
Greenley, over here.

16
00:02:22,784 --> 00:02:25,480
- You got a date?
- Yeah, but he stood me up.

17
00:02:25,553 --> 00:02:27,783
Release form. Sign it.

18
00:02:29,023 --> 00:02:31,048
You've been drawing on
the thousand dollars you came in with.

19
00:02:31,125 --> 00:02:34,583
Which leaves you with 68.50,
plus your $100 release gratuity.

20
00:02:34,662 --> 00:02:37,529
Gives you a total of 168.50.

21
00:02:37,598 --> 00:02:41,090
Report to your parole officer Monday.
Don't get lost. Stay out of trouble.

22
00:02:42,103 --> 00:02:44,970
You're not to leave Florida.
You violate this condition...

23
00:02:45,039 --> 00:02:47,599
a warrant will be issued
for your arrest immediately.

24
00:02:47,675 --> 00:02:50,473
You'll be right back here
where the sun don't shine.

25
00:03:00,655 --> 00:03:02,816
Here, I just quit.

26
00:03:04,058 --> 00:03:07,391
It's a Cartier, for real.
Take it. Go on.

27
00:03:07,462 --> 00:03:08,895
Thanks.

28
00:03:16,604 --> 00:03:19,164
Take what you want,
toss the rest.

00:05:48,589 --> 00:05:50,523
You know what kind of bird
that is?

33
00:05:52,426 --> 00:05:54,223
Dove.

34
00:05:54,295 --> 00:05:56,695
It's a blue diamond dove.

35
00:05:56,764 --> 00:05:58,891
- Really?
- Yep.

36
00:05:58,966 --> 00:06:03,369
It's a fuckin' blue diamond dove.
Look at the blue feathers.

37
00:06:06,440 --> 00:06:08,670
It's beautiful, huh?

38
00:06:10,478 --> 00:06:13,743
You know, there's only 300
of those guys left in the United States.

39
00:06:13,814 --> 00:06:17,341
If it shits on this car,
there's only gonna be 299.

40
00:06:22,523 --> 00:06:23,649
That's her.

41
00:07:03,631 --> 00:07:05,565
Hold the door!

42
00:07:13,207 --> 00:07:15,675
What's up with you, lady?

43

Jack!

44
00:07:30,925 --> 00:07:33,325
- Anything happen?
- What the hell's the matter with you?

45
00:07:33,394 --> 00:07:35,589
You don't make me wait
in the hallway like that.

46
00:07:35,663 --> 00:07:37,722
Did you go to the bank?
Did you get the money?

47
00:07:37,798 --> 00:07:40,426
Yeah, yeah.
Did you get the tickets?

48
00:07:40,501 --> 00:07:44,369
- Yeah. There's a man in the lobby.
- What kind of a man?

49
00:07:44,438 --> 00:07:46,372
- I don't know what kind of a man.
- What did he look like?

50
00:07:47,274 --> 00:07:50,243
- Where are the kids?
- They're in the kitchen.

51
00:07:52,313 --> 00:07:55,749
- Mommy, are the kids' bags packed?
- Mommy, Nicky's wheezing.

52
00:07:55,816 --> 00:07:57,750
I'm not wheezing, damn it!

53
00:07:57,818 --> 00:07:59,046
Go get your inhaler.

54
00:08:00,321 --> 00:08:02,312
- You're not taking my grandchildren.
- Mind your own fucking business!

55
00:08:02,390 --> 00:08:05,154
- Do not swear at my mother!
- I'm staying here with Grandma.

56
00:08:05,226 --> 00:08:08,787
It's gonna be all right.
Mommy, take them inside.

57
00:08:08,863 --> 00:08:10,558
- Where are we going?
- It's gonna be all right.

58
00:08:10,631 --> 00:08:12,963
- Let's get you breakfast.
- They don't know anything.

59
00:08:13,034 --> 00:08:15,298
They don't know what we're doing,
where we're going.

60
00:08:17,671 --> 00:08:20,697
Just a stupid remark?

61
00:08:20,775 --> 00:08:24,142
You're gonna check the disk
when you get home?

62
00:08:24,211 --> 00:08:27,339
- You tipped them off.
- I wanted a goddamn raise, Angie.

63
00:08:27,415 --> 00:08:30,179
I said something about the disk.
So?

64
00:08:30,251 --> 00:08:33,118
Now he knows you've been
copying it all down, right?

65
00:08:33,187 --> 00:08:36,020
Every move they made,
all the details, everything.

66
00:08:36,090 --> 00:08:39,423
- Who told you copy shit down?
- I did it for us, Angie.

67
00:08:39,493 --> 00:08:41,893
I did it so we had something
to fall back on.

68
00:08:41,962 --> 00:08:44,157
They don't know about the money, so?

69
00:08:50,237 --> 00:08:52,831
Do they know about the money?

70
00:08:54,175 --> 00:08:55,472
I don't know.

71
00:08:59,947 --> 00:09:01,881
They're gonna...

72
00:09:04,418 --> 00:09:05,851
Now they're gonna kill us.

73
00:09:05,920 --> 00:09:08,889
Nobody's gonna get killed, okay?
All we gotta do... Listen to me.

74
00:09:08,956 --> 00:09:10,890
All we gotta do
is get out of this city.

75
00:09:13,594 --> 00:09:16,028
Mama, pack the bags!

76
00:09:19,033 --> 00:09:22,093
You lousy piece of dirt.

77
00:09:22,169 --> 00:09:26,003
How could you do this
to your family?

78
00:09:26,073 --> 00:09:27,563
These kids are not leaving.

79
00:09:27,641 --> 00:09:30,735
If you got yourself into trouble,
that's your tough luck.

80
00:09:30,811 --> 00:09:34,611
- These kids are not involved.
- They know about the kids.

81
00:09:34,682 --> 00:09:38,812
You cannot keep them.
They will come here and take them.

82
00:09:38,886 --> 00:09:40,820
You get it?

83
00:09:48,329 --> 00:09:51,025
- Here, take this.
- No!

84
00:09:51,098 --> 00:09:53,828
- I'm calling the police.
- Are you out of your mind? No!

85
00:09:53,901 --> 00:09:57,200
Damn it! This is your fault!
You got us into this!

86
00:09:57,271 --> 00:10:01,105
Shut up! Quiet! Goddamn it!

87
00:10:07,681 --> 00:10:10,081
- Okay, we are leaving now.
- I'm not going!

88
00:10:10,151 --> 00:10:11,448
I'm not playing around.

89
00:10:11,519 --> 00:10:14,955
I don't want to!
I don't want to go!

90
00:10:24,165 --> 00:10:26,633
Is somebody coming to get us?

91
00:10:31,071 --> 00:10:33,005
Come here.

92
00:10:48,789 --> 00:10:50,154
Listen to me.

93
00:10:51,392 --> 00:10:54,384
Take this disk.
It will save your life.

94
00:10:54,461 --> 00:10:58,295
It's your bible. It's everything
I know about everything, okay?

95
00:10:58,365 --> 00:10:59,559
You go.

96
00:10:59,633 --> 00:11:02,466
Okay? Go down the tire escape
the way you did when you ran away.

97
00:11:02,536 --> 00:11:04,731
Remember?
You listening to me?

98
00:11:04,805 --> 00:11:07,399
Go find Uncle Manny,
over the bodega.

99
00:11:07,474 --> 00:11:10,341
- You know the bodega?
- Yeah, I understand the bodega.

100
00:11:10,411 --> 00:11:14,108
Find Uncle Manny, give him this disk.
He'll know exactly what to do with it.

101
00:11:14,181 --> 00:11:17,810
Don't answer the door, Angie!
Listen to me, okay?

102
00:11:17,885 --> 00:11:20,547
You be a man...

103
00:11:20,621 --> 00:11:22,521
and you be tough, okay?

104
00:11:22,590 --> 00:11:24,524
Always be tough
and trust nobody.

105
00:11:24,592 --> 00:11:26,116
No broads, no friends.

106
00:11:26,193 --> 00:11:28,320
Angie, don't answer that door!

107
00:11:28,395 --> 00:11:31,660
You make your own way in this world,
and you call your own shots, okay?

108
00:11:31,732 --> 00:11:34,030
Now you go.
You got your inhaler?

109
00:11:34,101 --> 00:11:36,160
I got it. It's right here.

110
00:11:36,237 --> 00:11:40,173
No, just go.
You're the man now.

111
00:11:40,241 --> 00:11:42,436
You're the head of the family now.
You understand me?

112
00:11:42,509 --> 00:11:45,501
I understand.
I'm the head of the family.

113
00:11:45,579 --> 00:11:47,570
Yeah, you are. Yeah.

114
00:11:49,416 --> 00:11:51,816
- I love you.
- I know.

115
00:11:58,525 --> 00:12:00,459
Come on. You go.

116
00:12:02,396 --> 00:12:05,024
Remember, you're the man.

117
00:12:05,099 --> 00:12:07,590
I know. I'm the man.

118
00:12:07,668 --> 00:12:09,499
Go!

119
00:12:28,922 --> 00:12:31,049
You gotta pull the slide back first.

120
00:12:31,825 --> 00:12:33,486
Too late.

121
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:36,552
Drop it.

122
00:12:36,630 --> 00:12:38,655
Kick it over here.

123
00:12:41,568 --> 00:12:43,160
<i>Get away from her.</i>

124
00:12:43,237 --> 00:12:44,329
Over there.

125
00:12:44,405 --> 00:12:46,896
- No, no!
- Move. Come on. Now.

126
00:12:52,079 --> 00:12:55,515
<i>Old lady, over there.
Move. Come on.</i>

127
00:13:00,321 --> 00:13:01,413
Where is it?

128
00:13:04,091 --> 00:13:05,558
Where's what?

129
00:13:05,626 --> 00:13:08,026
Where's the fucking disk?

130
00:13:09,530 --> 00:13:12,260
I don't know what you're
talking about, Sean.

131
00:13:18,305 --> 00:13:20,102
<i>Give me the disk.</i>

132
00:13:20,174 --> 00:13:22,438
I don't have it, man.

133
00:13:22,509 --> 00:13:25,535
I swear I don't have it.
It's not here.

134
00:13:27,114 --> 00:13:28,274
Don't.

135
00:13:37,858 --> 00:13:39,223
Let me call a doctor.

136
00:13:40,361 --> 00:13:42,295
Where's the disk, Jack?

137
00:13:45,599 --> 00:13:47,226
Give me the disk.

138
00:13:47,301 --> 00:13:49,235
I don't have it.

139
00:13:55,909 --> 00:13:57,774
Mommy?

140
00:14:06,220 --> 00:14:08,154
<i>Papi,</i> please.

141
00:14:09,823 --> 00:14:11,256
Someone!

142
00:14:26,673 --> 00:14:27,765
Hey, kid.

143
00:14:40,621 --> 00:14:43,215
Like you are some fashion plate?

144
00:14:54,802 --> 00:14:56,963
You didn't have to
turn it into a bloodbath.

145
00:14:57,037 --> 00:15:01,030
- He pulled a gun on me.
- He's a lousy little accountant.

146
00:15:01,108 --> 00:15:04,805
This guy, his name is Jesus.
Thanks, Ian.

147
00:15:04,878 --> 00:15:07,972
Jesus. But he wanted everybody
to call him Jack.

148
00:15:08,048 --> 00:15:11,245
That should tell you
what kind of a guy he is.

149
00:15:11,318 --> 00:15:14,617
You say "boo" to him,
he’d tall over and wet his pants.

150
00:15:14,688 --> 00:15:17,623
He's as harmless
as cherry-fuckin' -pie.

151
00:15:19,259 --> 00:15:21,454
Now I'm stuck with a kid.

152
00:15:21,528 --> 00:15:23,928
- The kid saw us.
- You shouldn't have brought him here!

153
00:15:23,997 --> 00:15:26,727
I do not want to kill again.

154
00:15:31,038 --> 00:15:34,906
Goddamn it. What am I gonna do
with a goddamn kid?

155
00:15:34,975 --> 00:15:37,409
I know what I’d do.

156
00:15:37,478 --> 00:15:40,242
Get the hell out of my sight.

157
00:15:43,050 --> 00:15:44,779
Fuckin' loser.

158
00:15:44,852 --> 00:15:47,514
We better pray to God
he didn't make any copies.

159
00:15:47,588 --> 00:15:49,579
What the hell happened, Raymond?

160
00:15:49,656 --> 00:15:52,386
He got greedy.

161
00:15:52,459 --> 00:15:54,654
Terry, what's wrong
with the goddamn kid?

162
00:15:54,728 --> 00:15:56,889
I don't know.
He's got asthma or something.

163
00:15:56,964 --> 00:15:58,898
Make him stop.
It's getting on my nerves.

164
00:16:01,068 --> 00:16:02,296
Kid, let's go.

165
00:16:05,906 --> 00:16:08,966
- It's empty.
- Be quiet.

166
00:16:09,042 --> 00:16:11,738
Where's my dad? You said my dad
was gonna pick me up.

167
00:16:11,812 --> 00:16:12,904
Shut up.

168
00:16:12,980 --> 00:16:15,210
- TV time.
- I'm worried about my sister.

169
00:16:15,282 --> 00:16:17,910
I think I should go home now.

170
00:16:17,985 --> 00:16:21,648
Kid, don't worry about your family.
Start worrying about yourself.

171
00:16:43,277 --> 00:16:46,246
- Zach, ya son of a bitch.
- Gloria!

172
00:16:46,313 --> 00:16:48,873
- How the hell are ya?
- Jesus.

173
00:16:48,949 --> 00:16:51,213
- It's been a long time.
- Three years.

174
00:16:51,285 --> 00:16:53,310
- You look great.
- Yeah?

175
00:16:53,387 --> 00:16:55,821
- You let me up?
- Oh, yeah.

176
00:16:57,558 --> 00:16:59,992
- It's good to see you.
- You too.

177
00:17:01,395 --> 00:17:03,454
Tell Kevin
Gloria's on her way up.

178
00:17:03,530 --> 00:17:05,657
Kevin, Gloria's here.

179
00:17:07,234 --> 00:17:09,327
What do you mean, "here"?

180
00:17:09,403 --> 00:17:11,735
Not here in the building?

181
00:17:11,805 --> 00:17:14,171
She's on her way up.

182
00:17:22,683 --> 00:17:24,617
You look gorgeous.

183
00:17:27,487 --> 00:17:31,150
I thought you weren't getting out until
next week. I would have picked you up.

184
00:17:31,224 --> 00:17:34,887
I wanted to surprise you.
Surprise.

185
00:17:34,962 --> 00:17:37,260
- I've missed you so much.
- Yeah.

186
00:17:37,331 --> 00:17:39,265
You look great, Gloria.

187
00:17:39,333 --> 00:17:40,766
Raymond.

188
00:17:42,869 --> 00:17:46,430
- Gloria, how are ya?
- Just swell, Mick.

189
00:17:46,506 --> 00:17:48,838
- Terry.
- Gloria.

190
00:17:48,909 --> 00:17:51,844
- Sean.
- Nice to see you.

191
00:17:51,912 --> 00:17:53,345
Ian.

192
00:17:55,349 --> 00:17:57,283
Where's my stuff?

193
00:17:57,351 --> 00:17:59,285
Did a little remodeling.

194
00:17:59,353 --> 00:18:02,117
What about my cats?

195
00:18:02,189 --> 00:18:05,283
I thought your sister took them.

196
00:18:05,359 --> 00:18:09,090
I gotta change.
Look like a drag queen.

197
00:18:19,206 --> 00:18:21,003
Great to see you.

198
00:18:21,074 --> 00:18:23,201
You never came to see me,
not ever, not once.

199
00:18:23,276 --> 00:18:26,211
- I really wanted to.
- Never ever, not once.

200
00:18:26,279 --> 00:18:29,680
In three goddamn years,
you never came to see me.

201
00:18:29,750 --> 00:18:32,150
- What stood in your way?
- I couldn't.

202
00:18:32,219 --> 00:18:34,847
- Really? Why not?
- Ruby always needs me.

203
00:18:34,921 --> 00:18:36,855
- You know that.
- Who the fuck needs Ruby?

204
00:18:36,923 --> 00:18:39,983
I'm sick of these people.
When does it get down to being me?

205
00:18:40,060 --> 00:18:42,585
- I've been working 20 hours a day.
- I went to the slammer for you.

206
00:18:42,663 --> 00:18:44,756
- You never showed up. Fine!
- What was I supposed to do?

207
00:18:44,831 --> 00:18:47,356
- I want my money and I want out.
- Walk in and announce myself?

208
00:18:47,434 --> 00:18:49,925
- Give me my money. I want out.
- You don't have to worry about money.

209
00:18:50,003 --> 00:18:52,904
I'm gonna take care of you.

210
00:18:52,973 --> 00:18:55,874
I don't want you
taking care of me.

211
00:18:55,942 --> 00:19:00,003
I've had three years of your
taking care of me. I've had it!

212
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,014
- You got that?
- Okay.

213
00:19:05,252 --> 00:19:07,618
I know you're pissed off.

214
00:19:09,456 --> 00:19:11,390
I'm not pissed oft.

215
00:19:12,459 --> 00:19:14,620
You know me very well.

216
00:19:14,695 --> 00:19:18,495
You know when I'm pissed off.
Do I look pissed off to you?

217
00:19:19,299 --> 00:19:21,233
You wanna make love?

218
00:19:22,803 --> 00:19:26,864
Do I wanna make love?
No, I do not wanna make love.

219
00:19:26,940 --> 00:19:29,465
Maybe you’d like to change
the fucking sheets first.

220
00:19:29,543 --> 00:19:31,602
- Not now.
- Sorry.

221
00:19:31,678 --> 00:19:34,943
- I said not now!
- Sorry. It's Ruby on the phone.

222
00:19:35,015 --> 00:19:37,313
He says it's important.

223
00:19:38,785 --> 00:19:40,719
Well, it's Ruby.

224
00:19:47,728 --> 00:19:50,162
I'll just be a minute.

225
00:19:58,171 --> 00:20:00,765
- Welcome back.
- Thanks.

226
00:20:00,841 --> 00:20:04,333
You got any good
lesbian prison stories?

227
00:20:04,411 --> 00:20:09,144
You know, I got one word
for you, Terry: therapy.

228
00:20:09,216 --> 00:20:12,913
I’d say group therapy,
but I like other people too much.

229
00:20:19,392 --> 00:20:21,326
What's the matter with you?

230
00:20:23,196 --> 00:20:25,130
Who the hell are you?

231
00:20:25,198 --> 00:20:27,666
Watch your mouth, you wee fucker.

232
00:20:27,734 --> 00:20:30,202
He has asthma.
Ran out of his medicine.

233
00:20:30,270 --> 00:20:33,171
Asthma, huh?
Good-looking guy like you?

234
00:20:33,240 --> 00:20:35,800
My dad was supposed to be here.

235
00:20:36,710 --> 00:20:37,802
Yeah?

236
00:20:37,878 --> 00:20:40,676
I'm worried about
my sister, lady.

237
00:20:40,747 --> 00:20:43,682
Can you ask them about my dad?

238
00:20:43,750 --> 00:20:47,880
Kid, shut your goddamn trap,
all right?

239
00:20:47,954 --> 00:20:49,945
What's with the kid?

240
00:20:50,023 --> 00:20:52,548
I had a situation
with his father.

241
00:20:52,626 --> 00:20:56,062
- I had some trouble.
- Are you kidnapping kids now?

242
00:20:56,129 --> 00:20:58,290
Just mind your own business.

243
00:20:58,365 --> 00:21:01,266
This is my business.
This is my apartment.

244
00:21:01,334 --> 00:21:02,961
- Yeah?
- Yeah.

245
00:21:03,036 --> 00:21:05,402
Who the hell do you think
pays the goddamn bills?

246
00:21:05,472 --> 00:21:06,598
Lucky me.

247
00:21:06,673 --> 00:21:08,607
It must be fucking you.

248
00:21:10,010 --> 00:21:11,944
- Gloria, come on.
- Excuse me.

249
00:21:12,012 --> 00:21:13,946
What are you doing?

250
00:21:20,253 --> 00:21:22,585
I'm still in love with you.

251
00:21:27,194 --> 00:21:29,754
I've loved you my whole life.

252
00:21:31,698 --> 00:21:35,429
I understand it's hard.
It's been three years.

253
00:21:35,502 --> 00:21:37,766
There's distance.

254
00:21:37,838 --> 00:21:39,499
Yeah.

255
00:21:39,573 --> 00:21:42,167
It's not distance, you know?

256
00:21:42,242 --> 00:21:44,176
- It's...
- What?

257
00:21:46,813 --> 00:21:48,542
Shit.

258
00:21:48,615 --> 00:21:51,778
Okay, you wanna talk.
Let's talk.

259
00:21:51,852 --> 00:21:53,376
What do you wanna talk about?

260
00:21:59,960 --> 00:22:02,428
Look, I took the rap for you.

261
00:22:02,495 --> 00:22:04,895
- I know.
- Most people would have talked.

262
00:22:04,965 --> 00:22:06,899
I didn't talk.

263
00:22:10,237 --> 00:22:13,331
Look, we had a deal here.

264
00:22:13,406 --> 00:22:17,775
You said there’d be money in a bank.
Where's the money? Where's the bank?

265
00:22:19,546 --> 00:22:22,447
Kevin, I took the rap
for something I didn't do.

266
00:22:22,515 --> 00:22:24,005
You owe me.

267
00:22:24,084 --> 00:22:25,642
- Here.
- I don't want that.

268
00:22:27,254 --> 00:22:29,552
I'm trying
to change my life here.

269
00:22:32,959 --> 00:22:35,928
Jesus Christ! Talking to you
is like talking to a fuckin' brick wall.

270
00:22:35,996 --> 00:22:38,863
You're right. We had a deal.

271
00:22:39,833 --> 00:22:40,993
I owe you.

272
00:22:41,067 --> 00:22:44,935
Please don't think I'm
not grateful, 'cause I am.

273
00:22:45,005 --> 00:22:47,439
But there was more...

274
00:22:47,507 --> 00:22:50,101
than just the deal
between us, right?

275
00:22:54,414 --> 00:22:56,678
Listen, you...

276
00:22:56,750 --> 00:23:01,016
you were wearing this dress
the night of your going-in party...

277
00:23:01,087 --> 00:23:03,078
three years ago.

278
00:23:03,156 --> 00:23:05,624
And I'm still wearin' it.
So what?

279
00:23:07,594 --> 00:23:10,062
I've been thinking about that night
for three years.

280
00:23:10,130 --> 00:23:12,860
- Three fucking years.
- Oh.

281
00:23:15,669 --> 00:23:18,035
Thinking about that penthouse.

282
00:23:23,877 --> 00:23:25,811
Do you remember me and you
that night?

283
00:23:27,580 --> 00:23:29,844
Oh, honey.

284
00:23:29,916 --> 00:23:32,111
You're no good.

285
00:23:32,185 --> 00:23:35,086
You're just no damn good.

286
00:23:36,156 --> 00:23:37,953
I know.

287
00:23:38,024 --> 00:23:39,548
Come on.

288
00:23:43,396 --> 00:23:45,557
Say you're my baby.

289
00:23:46,733 --> 00:23:47,927
Say it.

290
00:23:49,903 --> 00:23:50,995
I'm not gonna.

291
00:23:51,071 --> 00:23:53,665
Say you're my baby.

292
00:23:58,712 --> 00:24:00,543
Honey.

293
00:24:00,613 --> 00:24:02,581
Say you're my baby.

294
00:24:11,925 --> 00:24:13,859
- Come here.
- Let me go! No.

295
00:24:18,765 --> 00:24:22,428
I want my money now.

296
00:24:22,502 --> 00:24:24,436
- We had a deal.
- A deal?

297
00:24:24,504 --> 00:24:26,734
- Yes.
- A deal?

298
00:24:27,741 --> 00:24:30,437
The deal has changed, right?

299
00:24:30,510 --> 00:24:33,035
You want your own apartment,
have your own apartment.

300
00:24:33,113 --> 00:24:36,981
You want new clothes,
I'll buy you new clothes.

301
00:24:37,050 --> 00:24:40,042
You want to get yourself a new cat,
go get yourself a new cat.

302
00:24:40,120 --> 00:24:41,246
Whatever you want.

303
00:24:42,322 --> 00:24:45,291
- When do you report for parole?
- Monday.

304
00:24:45,358 --> 00:24:49,089
You're back here Tuesday through the
weekend till you report back next week.

305
00:24:49,162 --> 00:24:52,461
Then you're back here again.
That's it. That's the deal. That's done.

306
00:25:03,143 --> 00:25:06,203
I'm not gonna take
your bullshit anymore.

307
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:08,440
- It's over.
- No, it's not.

308
00:25:08,515 --> 00:25:11,211
- Will you stop saying that?
- It's over! It's over!

309
00:25:11,284 --> 00:25:13,650
- It is over!
- Stop it!

310
00:25:22,062 --> 00:25:24,997
I always knew you were a bastard.

311
00:26:02,001 --> 00:26:03,434
Fuck!

312
00:26:26,092 --> 00:26:28,822
You never shot a short guy before?
What's the big deal?

313
00:26:30,029 --> 00:26:32,224
Short, tall, tat, skinny.

314
00:26:32,298 --> 00:26:34,926
They're all grown up.
You're talking about killing a kid.

315
00:26:36,536 --> 00:26:39,528
This is the father.
This is the son.

316
00:26:40,373 --> 00:26:43,399
The only difference is three feet.
I'll do it.

317
00:26:44,277 --> 00:26:46,609
Kevin's not gonna like it.

318
00:26:46,679 --> 00:26:49,113
I don't give a shit whether Kevin
likes it. It's gotta be done.

319
00:26:50,650 --> 00:26:53,210
It's my ass. I was the one
who was up there.

320
00:26:53,286 --> 00:26:55,618
- Did the kid see you?
- I don't know.

321
00:26:55,688 --> 00:26:58,851
I don't like
to leave loose ends.

322
00:26:58,925 --> 00:27:02,190
All right, Mickey, it's your turn.
I didn't leave you much.

323
00:27:02,262 --> 00:27:05,857
You sure didn't leave me much.

324
00:27:09,969 --> 00:27:11,061
Kid.

325
00:27:13,039 --> 00:27:15,872
Did you forget something?

326
00:27:15,942 --> 00:27:19,969
I just thought, you know,
Kevin might be in here.

327
00:27:20,046 --> 00:27:21,946
Kevin's in his office.

328
00:27:24,184 --> 00:27:27,745
Terry, you wouldn't hurt
a little kid, would ya?

329
00:27:30,790 --> 00:27:33,258
You better get out of here.

330
00:27:35,195 --> 00:27:38,289
Kid, come on.
Come over here.

331
00:27:38,364 --> 00:27:40,298
He's watching his show.

332
00:27:41,935 --> 00:27:44,301
What's your favorite cartoon, kid?

333
00:27:44,370 --> 00:27:46,895
- Mine's " Top Cat. " He's cool.
- Come over here right now.

334
00:27:46,973 --> 00:27:49,066
Calm the fuck down.

335
00:27:49,142 --> 00:27:52,475
- What are you fucking doing?
- What's your fucking problem?

336
00:27:52,545 --> 00:27:54,979
You gonna calm the fuck down?

337
00:27:55,048 --> 00:27:57,107
Yeah.

338
00:27:57,183 --> 00:27:59,310
I just lost my head.

339
00:27:59,385 --> 00:28:02,377
- You're gonna walk right out of here?
- Yeah, I lost my head.

340
00:28:02,455 --> 00:28:05,253
You're right.
It's none of my fuckin' business.

341
00:28:05,325 --> 00:28:06,519
All right.

342
00:28:09,996 --> 00:28:11,463
Kid, come here.

343
00:28:14,867 --> 00:28:17,267
Come on!

344
00:28:17,337 --> 00:28:19,669
Right now! Come on!

345
00:28:19,739 --> 00:28:21,036
- Kevin.
- Get out there.

346
00:28:21,107 --> 00:28:23,667
All right, get up.

347
00:28:24,911 --> 00:28:27,072
Go on.

348
00:28:27,146 --> 00:28:31,276
Great. Everybody, guns down.
Put 'em on the ground right now.

349
00:28:34,954 --> 00:28:38,048
Kick 'em forward.
You, go over there.

350
00:28:39,659 --> 00:28:42,457
Jesus, Kevin, what are you doing,
killin' kids now?

351
00:28:42,528 --> 00:28:45,622
Gloria, put the gun down.
Nobody's killing anybody.

352
00:28:46,633 --> 00:28:47,725
Get up there.

353
00:28:53,706 --> 00:28:55,469
What's the matter with you?

354
00:28:55,541 --> 00:28:58,203
Get up there. Go on.

355
00:29:00,280 --> 00:29:01,372
You too, Raymond.

356
00:29:01,447 --> 00:29:04,974
Get up the stairs right now,
or I'll shoot him, I swear to God.

357
00:29:05,852 --> 00:29:08,719
You, get up there.
Get up!

358
00:29:11,024 --> 00:29:12,958
All right, kid.

359
00:29:13,026 --> 00:29:15,290
Go get my bag.

360
00:29:15,361 --> 00:29:18,387
All right,
you all just get back.

361
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:23,691
All right, kid.
Come here. Open the bag.

362
00:29:23,770 --> 00:29:25,067
Have you lost your mind?

363
00:29:25,138 --> 00:29:27,868
Yeah, I have. Now I lost it twice.
How about that?

364
00:29:27,940 --> 00:29:30,067
Now, just...

365
00:29:30,143 --> 00:29:32,338
empty your pockets.

366
00:29:32,412 --> 00:29:35,347
Put your money on the table
right now.

367
00:29:36,149 --> 00:29:38,674
I am not fuckin' around here!

368
00:29:42,188 --> 00:29:44,122
You're making
a big fuckin' mistake.

369
00:29:44,190 --> 00:29:46,624
You know what, Kevin?
You're my big fuckin' mistake.

370
00:29:46,693 --> 00:29:49,924
I went through shit you wouldn't
even want to fuckin' dream about.

371
00:29:49,996 --> 00:29:52,226
And for what?

372
00:29:52,298 --> 00:29:56,530
For some two-bit, cheap,
fuckin' asshole, that's what.

373
00:29:57,603 --> 00:29:59,400
Jewelry too.

374
00:29:59,472 --> 00:30:01,599
- This is my grandfather's watch.
- Great.

375
00:30:03,109 --> 00:30:05,577
- I'll never forget this.
- Come here, kid.

376
00:30:05,645 --> 00:30:08,705
Now, all of you, back up.
Back up.

377
00:30:08,781 --> 00:30:11,443
Back up.
All right, come here.

378
00:30:11,517 --> 00:30:14,714
I want you to hop up here.
That's good.

379
00:30:14,787 --> 00:30:17,119
Just put all that jewelry
in your hat.

380
00:30:17,190 --> 00:30:20,091
If you make a move towards this kid,
I'm blowing your brains out.

381
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:21,820
You got that?

382
00:30:21,894 --> 00:30:23,953
Hurry it up, kid.

383
00:30:27,834 --> 00:30:29,961
Get back, Terry.
All right, kid.

384
00:30:31,037 --> 00:30:34,632
Get down here. You put that
in the bag and stay behind me.

385
00:30:36,042 --> 00:30:39,136
You'll be sorry for this,
I promise you.

386
00:30:39,212 --> 00:30:42,841
You will be sorry, Kevin,
if you even think of coming after me.

387
00:30:42,915 --> 00:30:44,974
Statute of limitations
is seven years.

388
00:30:45,051 --> 00:30:47,485
Don't make me turn
state's evidence against you.

389
00:30:47,553 --> 00:30:48,679
All right now.

390
00:30:50,890 --> 00:30:53,586
I want all of you
to take oft your clothes.

391
00:30:53,659 --> 00:30:57,186
- Come on!
- I mean it. Take oft your clothes now.

392
00:30:57,263 --> 00:31:00,130
I haven't seen a naked man
in three years. Fuck you!

393
00:31:00,199 --> 00:31:01,598
So give me a show.

394
00:31:06,372 --> 00:31:08,306
Come on.

395
00:31:09,776 --> 00:31:11,835
Why are you folding up your clothes?
This is a stickup.

396
00:31:11,911 --> 00:31:15,278
- I'm sorry.
- Throw 'em up forward, right now.

397
00:31:19,118 --> 00:31:21,916
All right. Come here, kid.

398
00:31:23,423 --> 00:31:25,391
Gather these up, all right?

399
00:31:25,458 --> 00:31:27,426
Not the glass.
Be careful of the glass.

400
00:31:29,395 --> 00:31:32,523
Underwear too. Underwear too.

401
00:31:34,100 --> 00:31:37,501
Come on, you big bunch of studs.
Underwear too. Right now.

402
00:31:41,774 --> 00:31:43,139
Throw it up here.

403
00:31:46,813 --> 00:31:48,906
Big bunch of studs.
Yeah, yeah.

404
00:31:52,652 --> 00:31:54,586
Wait a minute.

405
00:31:56,022 --> 00:31:59,822
I want you to throw them out
the window over there, all right?

406
00:31:59,892 --> 00:32:02,292
All right. Watch the bag.

407
00:32:04,030 --> 00:32:06,225
- Right down there.
- I know where.

408
00:32:06,299 --> 00:32:08,494
To your left.

409
00:32:08,568 --> 00:32:10,832
You got it. Go on.

410
00:32:12,738 --> 00:32:14,672
Raymond, who knew?

411
00:32:17,143 --> 00:32:19,873
Now, don't any of you guys move.

412
00:32:19,946 --> 00:32:22,881
Kid, throw everything out the window.
Just chuck it right out the window.

413
00:32:22,949 --> 00:32:24,109
Don't you move.

414
00:32:24,183 --> 00:32:27,175
Shoes too. Get everything.

415
00:32:32,091 --> 00:32:35,583
What the fuck...
This is fuckin' shit.

416
00:32:39,699 --> 00:32:41,758
All right, come on. Let's go.

417
00:32:43,302 --> 00:32:45,293
- Where are you going?
- I'll be right back.

418
00:32:48,674 --> 00:32:49,800
Come on!

419
00:32:52,712 --> 00:32:55,203
Do not leave here
with that disk, Gloria.

420
00:32:55,281 --> 00:32:57,215
I'm not fuckin' around.

421
00:32:58,584 --> 00:33:00,245
I will kill you.

422
00:33:00,319 --> 00:33:02,981
I bet you would.

423
00:33:04,724 --> 00:33:08,353
Fuck you for thinking you
ever owned me or still do.

424
00:33:08,427 --> 00:33:10,952
Kid, run.
Open the door right there.

425
00:33:16,035 --> 00:33:18,833
Thanks for taking care
of my cats, prick!

426
00:33:19,639 --> 00:33:21,072
Go, go!

427
00:33:24,143 --> 00:33:28,307
Kid, when you get to the street,
I want you to run like hell.

428
00:33:31,350 --> 00:33:33,318
What was going on up there?

429
00:33:35,321 --> 00:33:36,618
Playing strip poker.

430
00:33:39,025 --> 00:33:40,117
Take off.

431
00:33:43,329 --> 00:33:46,321
Those guys weren't kidding around.
They were really gonna hurt you.

432
00:33:46,399 --> 00:33:48,993
- I can take care of myself.
- Yeah, right.

433
00:33:49,068 --> 00:33:51,969
- Where do you live?
- 158th Street.

434
00:33:52,038 --> 00:33:55,804
All right.
See the subway over there?

435
00:33:55,875 --> 00:34:00,505
I want you to run
and go get on the subway.

436
00:34:00,580 --> 00:34:02,912
- I don't know how.
- You don't know how what?

437
00:34:02,982 --> 00:34:06,816
- To get on the subway.
- You just...

438
00:34:06,886 --> 00:34:10,720
You just get on the subway and
get off at 158th Street, all right?

439
00:34:10,790 --> 00:34:14,055
I can't by myself.
I'll get lost.

440
00:34:14,126 --> 00:34:17,562
You can do it, honey.
Just get off at 158th, okay?

441
00:34:17,630 --> 00:34:20,599
- I can't.
- Sure, you can.

442
00:34:20,666 --> 00:34:23,658
- I can't by myself.
- Jesus Christ.

443
00:34:23,736 --> 00:34:26,068
All right, come on.

444
00:34:30,676 --> 00:34:32,109
Ruby.

445
00:34:33,212 --> 00:34:36,409
You took time oft
from your busy schedule.

446
00:34:40,453 --> 00:34:43,149
Sorry I'm late. How's things?

447
00:34:44,357 --> 00:34:47,053
I'm still losin'

448
00:34:47,126 --> 00:34:49,526
The ponies,
they're unpredictable.

449
00:34:49,595 --> 00:34:51,620
That's why I play 'em.

450
00:34:51,697 --> 00:34:55,895
You know me. I always win eventually,
one way or the other.

451
00:34:58,004 --> 00:35:01,405
But enough of this social chatter.

452
00:35:01,474 --> 00:35:03,237
I want to see your lips move.

453
00:35:03,309 --> 00:35:06,745
I want to see the words
come out of your mouth...

454
00:35:06,812 --> 00:35:08,746
so I can find out
if I believe 'em.

455
00:35:10,683 --> 00:35:11,775
Everything's fine.

456
00:35:13,486 --> 00:35:16,216
The only thing that's tine
is the way you lie.

457
00:35:16,288 --> 00:35:19,086
I respect that, sort of.
You know, Kevin.

458
00:35:20,660 --> 00:35:23,356
You're one of these fellas
who read all the right books...

459
00:35:23,429 --> 00:35:26,398
and turned out all wrong.

460
00:35:26,465 --> 00:35:28,558
You were that way
when I first met you.

461
00:35:28,634 --> 00:35:30,898
You was like that
when you was a kid.

462
00:35:30,970 --> 00:35:34,098
So, which is it?

463
00:35:35,775 --> 00:35:39,040
Are you a fuckup or a thief?

464
00:35:40,513 --> 00:35:42,913
What are you saying, Ruby?

465
00:35:42,982 --> 00:35:46,383
You told me you had the kid
and the disk.

466
00:35:46,452 --> 00:35:48,113
I don't.

467
00:35:49,188 --> 00:35:52,453
But it's just a temporary setback,
like I said.

468
00:35:53,726 --> 00:35:54,818
Everything's tine.

469
00:35:56,796 --> 00:35:58,730
You know, Kevin...

470
00:35:58,798 --> 00:36:01,460
I've been in prison tour times.

471
00:36:01,534 --> 00:36:04,628
I don't want to
make it a handful.

472
00:36:05,805 --> 00:36:08,273
Do I have to remind you
what's on that disk?

473
00:36:08,340 --> 00:36:11,275
Names of cops, sergeants...

474
00:36:11,343 --> 00:36:13,709
lieutenants, captains.

475
00:36:13,779 --> 00:36:16,247
Everyone we had on the pad.

476
00:36:16,315 --> 00:36:19,716
Dates, numbered accounts,
judges...

477
00:36:19,785 --> 00:36:22,015
a congressman or two.

478
00:36:22,088 --> 00:36:23,180
Couriers.

479
00:36:24,256 --> 00:36:27,248
It's me whole fuckin' life’s work.

480
00:36:27,326 --> 00:36:30,159
Now, you got yourself
into trouble.

481
00:36:31,664 --> 00:36:34,792
- I expect you to work your way out.
- What can I say? I'm sorry.

482
00:36:37,903 --> 00:36:39,837
I'm sorry.

483
00:36:41,574 --> 00:36:43,838
It's all gonna be straightened out
today, I promise you.

484
00:36:46,412 --> 00:36:49,245
Now, if you get
into more trouble...

485
00:36:49,315 --> 00:36:52,182
I don't know you
and I never did...

486
00:36:52,251 --> 00:36:55,345
because it any of this
comes back to me...

487
00:36:56,722 --> 00:36:58,781
I'll kill ya.

488
00:36:58,858 --> 00:37:00,223
I promise.

489
00:37:02,728 --> 00:37:05,356
That won't be necessary, Ruby.

490
00:37:13,706 --> 00:37:16,504
Raymond, we got work to do.

491
00:37:31,824 --> 00:37:34,224
What the hell is this?

492
00:37:38,531 --> 00:37:41,056
- This your block, kid?
- Yeah.

493
00:37:41,133 --> 00:37:43,829
- Excuse me.
- Excuse me. Let us through.

494
00:37:43,903 --> 00:37:47,202
You let her through
and not me?

495
00:37:52,878 --> 00:37:56,746
Go on. Go home. Go on.

496
00:37:57,716 --> 00:38:00,048
Go home. Go.

497
00:38:00,119 --> 00:38:02,053
Go ahead.

498
00:38:09,929 --> 00:38:11,453
Hey, move.

499
00:38:32,518 --> 00:38:33,951
Hey, lady.

500
00:38:35,754 --> 00:38:38,279
- What?
- They won't let anybody in.

501
00:38:39,525 --> 00:38:42,119
So go back and wait a little bit.
Find your friends.

502
00:38:42,194 --> 00:38:45,129
- I'm hungry.
- All right, stay back.

503
00:39:03,215 --> 00:39:04,944
Come on.

504
00:39:06,552 --> 00:39:08,713
- Give me a slice.
- Pepperoni.

505
00:39:08,787 --> 00:39:11,153
Pepperoni. Go sit down.

506
00:39:19,632 --> 00:39:23,432
- So, kid, got any relatives?
- What?

507
00:39:24,570 --> 00:39:26,037
What's your name, kid?

508
00:39:26,105 --> 00:39:28,335
- Do you know your last name?
- Nuñez.

509
00:39:28,407 --> 00:39:32,309
Good. Nicky Nuñez.
Okay, good.

510
00:39:32,378 --> 00:39:35,711
- Got any grandparents?
- My grandma lives with us.

511
00:39:38,083 --> 00:39:40,017
Got any aunts or uncles?

512
00:39:40,085 --> 00:39:41,848
Uncle Manny.

513
00:39:41,921 --> 00:39:45,254
My father told me to go
to my Uncle Manny's.

514
00:39:45,324 --> 00:39:48,191
Great. Uncle Manny.
There you go.

515
00:39:49,528 --> 00:39:51,894
Where does Uncle Manny live?

516
00:39:51,964 --> 00:39:54,524
- Downtown.
- Good. Where downtown?

517
00:39:54,600 --> 00:39:57,660
- Over a grocery store.
- Okay.

518
00:39:57,736 --> 00:39:59,169
Good.

519
00:40:00,406 --> 00:40:03,068
This street that Uncle Manny
lives on... Hey!

520
00:40:03,142 --> 00:40:05,576
This street
that Uncle Manny lives on...

521
00:40:05,644 --> 00:40:09,512
When I'm talkin' to you...
You gotta help me out. You got that?

522
00:40:09,581 --> 00:40:12,209
This street that he lives on,
does it start with an "A"?

523
00:40:13,786 --> 00:40:16,346
Start with a " B," a " C"?

524
00:40:16,422 --> 00:40:19,323
- I don't know.
- What the hell am I doing with you?

525
00:40:19,391 --> 00:40:22,656
I didn't come here to hang out with you.
I gotta be back in Miami by Monday.

526
00:40:22,728 --> 00:40:25,561
A coffee, black, no sugar.

527
00:40:32,137 --> 00:40:33,764
- Keep still.
- It's me.

528
00:40:33,839 --> 00:40:37,297
There's cops all over.
Fire trucks, newscasters.

529
00:40:38,610 --> 00:40:42,410
Yeah, I'll just hang around
in case she shows up with the kid.

530
00:40:46,618 --> 00:40:48,745
Thanks. Keep the change.

531
00:40:51,090 --> 00:40:53,888
Where are we going?
I want to go home!

532
00:40:53,959 --> 00:40:57,087
Listen, you gotta shut up.
You can't go home, all right?

533
00:40:57,162 --> 00:40:59,153
We're in trouble here.
You gotta help me out.

534
00:40:59,231 --> 00:41:01,165
We gotta help each other out,
understand?

535
00:41:01,233 --> 00:41:03,326
I gotta get you somewhere.

536
00:41:03,402 --> 00:41:05,927
What are you talking about?
I wanna go home!

537
00:41:06,005 --> 00:41:09,338
Shut up, kid! You can't go home.
There's no one there anyway.

538
00:41:09,408 --> 00:41:11,968
Your parents aren't there.
They...

539
00:41:12,044 --> 00:41:16,708
They left, and they want me
to get you somewhere.

540
00:41:16,782 --> 00:41:20,274
I'm gonna take you to your uncle's.
Now, stay there.

541
00:41:30,729 --> 00:41:33,630
Shit. Sit still.

542
00:41:35,968 --> 00:41:37,401
Fuck!

543
00:41:39,571 --> 00:41:41,630
There's a lot of them here.

544
00:41:41,707 --> 00:41:44,198
" C.M. Leon. "
Is Manny his middle name?

545
00:41:44,276 --> 00:41:45,573
I don't know!

546
00:41:48,247 --> 00:41:50,181
"Jennifer Leon"?
Sound familiar?

547
00:41:50,249 --> 00:41:51,477
I don't know, lady.

548
00:41:51,550 --> 00:41:54,576
Jesus Christ, kid!
What do you know?

549
00:42:02,061 --> 00:42:05,121
- Hello?
- Hi. Is Manny there?

550
00:42:05,197 --> 00:42:07,461
- Yeah, this is Manny. Who's this?
- Manny!

551
00:42:07,533 --> 00:42:09,194
You got a nephew?

552
00:42:11,036 --> 00:42:12,970
Yeah. Who is this?

553
00:42:13,038 --> 00:42:16,838
Listen, Manny,
I got this kid here, Nicky Nuñez.

554
00:42:16,909 --> 00:42:20,436
- Is he your nephew?
- Yeah. Who the hell is this?

555
00:42:20,512 --> 00:42:23,379
It's a long story.

556
00:42:23,449 --> 00:42:26,509
Look, I just got him here,
and I need to bring him to you.

557
00:42:26,585 --> 00:42:29,076
So what's your address?

558
00:42:29,154 --> 00:42:31,714
Yeah.

559
00:42:31,790 --> 00:42:33,382
All right. Thank you.

560
00:42:33,459 --> 00:42:35,518
All right, come on!

561
00:42:35,594 --> 00:42:37,494
Stop fuckin' around.

562
00:42:38,964 --> 00:42:41,262
Stop, stop.

563
00:42:41,333 --> 00:42:43,858
- Here, keep that.
- Thank you very much.

564
00:42:43,936 --> 00:42:46,200
All right. Come on, kid.

565
00:42:57,416 --> 00:43:00,010
You're on your own here,
or what?

566
00:43:00,085 --> 00:43:03,384
All right. Hey, excuse me!

567
00:43:03,455 --> 00:43:06,947
Come down here.
You don't go without me.

568
00:43:07,025 --> 00:43:09,516
You do not go without me.

569
00:43:09,595 --> 00:43:11,529
I gotta go.

570
00:43:27,112 --> 00:43:29,239
I'm the person from the phone...

571
00:43:32,317 --> 00:43:34,251
Jesus Christ.

572
00:43:44,163 --> 00:43:46,461
- Where are we going?
- Don't worry about it. Let's go.

573
00:43:46,532 --> 00:43:50,093
Lady, are you crazy?
This is my Uncle Manny's house.

574
00:43:50,169 --> 00:43:51,363
Where are we going?

575
00:43:51,436 --> 00:43:53,870
- Don't worry about it.
- Screw you, lady!

576
00:43:53,939 --> 00:43:56,032
I'm going home.

577
00:43:57,609 --> 00:44:00,601
Jesus Christ, you stupid kid!
What are you doing?

578
00:44:00,679 --> 00:44:02,613
You don't understand.
This is serious business.

579
00:44:02,681 --> 00:44:04,808
I know these guys.
They're my friends.

580
00:44:04,883 --> 00:44:08,410
Oh, yeah?
You got some pretty shitty friends!

581
00:44:08,487 --> 00:44:11,923
Okay, you're a regular wiseass.
I gotta get you somewhere.

582
00:44:11,990 --> 00:44:14,117
Would you stop dragging me?

583
00:44:16,195 --> 00:44:19,460
I've been waiting in front
of that goddamn building for hours.

584
00:44:19,531 --> 00:44:21,624
Ian, let me get a black coffee.

585
00:44:21,700 --> 00:44:24,396
You and your fucking itchy fingers.

586
00:44:25,804 --> 00:44:29,240
- You're gonna get me buried.
- All right already, Kevin.

587
00:44:29,308 --> 00:44:32,675
He had a piece.
He had a fucking gun, okay?

588
00:44:32,744 --> 00:44:36,441
Sean, if you were any dumber,
I’d have to water you.

589
00:44:38,817 --> 00:44:40,114
Come here.

590
00:44:46,425 --> 00:44:48,552
- Cool it.
- Cool it?

591
00:44:48,627 --> 00:44:50,595
You want me to fucking cool it...

592
00:44:50,662 --> 00:44:53,995
when the whole goddamn organization's
goin' down the fuckin' drain?

593
00:44:55,968 --> 00:44:58,869
Your name's on that disk, Zach.

594
00:44:58,937 --> 00:45:00,962
And Raymond's too.

595
00:45:01,039 --> 00:45:03,007
And Mickey's and Terry's...

596
00:45:03,075 --> 00:45:06,203
and this stupid
shithead's name too!

597
00:45:06,278 --> 00:45:08,712
Everybody's name!

598
00:45:08,780 --> 00:45:11,146
We could be wiped out...

599
00:45:11,216 --> 00:45:12,945
for good!

600
00:45:13,018 --> 00:45:15,452
So clean up this fuckin' mess.

601
00:45:17,556 --> 00:45:20,150
I don't want no blood
stainin' my floor.

602
00:45:24,029 --> 00:45:26,930
I want you to try to
keep quiet in here, all right?

603
00:45:26,999 --> 00:45:29,024
My sister lives here.

604
00:45:30,269 --> 00:45:33,466
She's not always
too happy to see me.

605
00:45:36,441 --> 00:45:39,672
Jesus Christ.
What are you doing here?

606
00:45:39,745 --> 00:45:43,374
I was just in the neighborhood.
I thought...

607
00:45:43,448 --> 00:45:44,847
You gonna invite me in?

608
00:46:00,699 --> 00:46:02,633
So where is everybody?

609
00:46:03,702 --> 00:46:06,728
Jeffrey’s at work.
The kids are at school.

610
00:46:06,805 --> 00:46:09,672
I thought you were in prison.

611
00:46:09,741 --> 00:46:11,675
I just got out.

612
00:46:11,743 --> 00:46:13,904
You could have called first.

613
00:46:18,150 --> 00:46:21,244
- Who's the kid?
- A friend from prison.

614
00:46:31,296 --> 00:46:34,925
Now, look, I want you
to sit down here.

615
00:46:35,000 --> 00:46:37,662
Be good.
Don't touch nothing.

616
00:46:38,904 --> 00:46:40,838
I mean it.

617
00:46:43,208 --> 00:46:45,142
What are you doing
with someone's kid?

618
00:46:45,210 --> 00:46:46,643
Baby-sittin'

619
00:46:48,313 --> 00:46:51,771
So you off from work today?

620
00:46:51,850 --> 00:46:55,581
I don't work.
I'm a housewife.

621
00:46:55,654 --> 00:46:57,747
Well, hey, good for you.

622
00:46:57,823 --> 00:47:00,291
I'm glad all your dreams
came true.

623
00:47:01,460 --> 00:47:03,621
Look, Brenda...

624
00:47:03,695 --> 00:47:06,186
I know I'm like the last person
you wanted to see today...

625
00:47:06,264 --> 00:47:08,698
but I was wondering...

626
00:47:08,767 --> 00:47:12,430
if maybe we could
just stay here for tonight.

627
00:47:12,504 --> 00:47:14,665
Just the night.

628
00:47:15,841 --> 00:47:17,775
I don't think so.

629
00:47:19,378 --> 00:47:21,778
Jeffrey and the kids and...

630
00:47:21,847 --> 00:47:23,280
everything.

631
00:47:24,383 --> 00:47:25,475
Yeah.

632
00:47:27,352 --> 00:47:29,616
I'm in trouble with Kevin.

633
00:47:29,688 --> 00:47:32,657
When are you not in trouble?
Hello.

634
00:47:32,724 --> 00:47:33,748
It's Kevin.

635
00:47:35,894 --> 00:47:37,919
Been a long time.

636
00:47:37,996 --> 00:47:40,260
Yeah. How are you, Kevin?

637
00:47:42,067 --> 00:47:45,696
- How've you been?
- Pretty good. You, Brenda?

638
00:47:46,905 --> 00:47:47,997
Okay.

639
00:47:49,241 --> 00:47:50,640
Kids are growing, you know.

640
00:47:50,709 --> 00:47:53,007
Well, no,
unfortunately I don't.

641
00:47:53,078 --> 00:47:57,174
But now that Gloria's out,
maybe I can rectify that.

642
00:47:57,249 --> 00:47:59,149
Oh? Gloria's out?

643
00:48:00,285 --> 00:48:02,947
- You didn't know?
- No, I haven't seen her.

644
00:48:03,021 --> 00:48:07,788
Well, if she calls or anything,
I’d love to know.

645
00:48:08,627 --> 00:48:10,720
Sure.

646
00:48:10,796 --> 00:48:14,163
- You got my number, right?
- No. Give it to me.

647
00:48:14,232 --> 00:48:16,928
It's easy to remember.

648
00:48:17,002 --> 00:48:21,029
555-6363.

649
00:48:21,106 --> 00:48:22,334
I got it.

650
00:48:25,277 --> 00:48:27,211
I hope you're not lying to me.

651
00:48:27,279 --> 00:48:29,304
- <i>Are you lying to me?</i>
- No.

652
00:48:29,381 --> 00:48:31,815
Of course not.

653
00:48:31,883 --> 00:48:33,145
Why would I lie?

654
00:48:33,218 --> 00:48:36,153
I think that old friends
should not lie to each other.

655
00:48:36,221 --> 00:48:38,519
Of course.
Okay, take care, Kevin.

656
00:48:41,927 --> 00:48:44,157
What'd you do now?

657
00:48:44,229 --> 00:48:46,561
Look, thanks a lot.
All right?

658
00:48:47,732 --> 00:48:49,825
But it he calls again...

659
00:48:49,901 --> 00:48:52,267
you haven't seen me, okay?

660
00:48:52,337 --> 00:48:53,429
Kevin killed...

661
00:48:54,973 --> 00:48:56,702
Killed? Who?

662
00:48:56,775 --> 00:48:59,369
Who killed who?
What are you talking about?

663
00:48:59,444 --> 00:49:01,708
What the hell
are you talking about?

664
00:49:01,780 --> 00:49:03,611
Wait. Never mind.
I don't want to know.

665
00:49:03,682 --> 00:49:06,776
I don't want to know.
Oh, Jesus Christ.

666
00:49:06,852 --> 00:49:10,015
You shouldn't have this kid with you.
Kids should not be exposed to you.

667
00:49:10,088 --> 00:49:12,147
- What am I, the mumps?
- Let me get to the point.

668
00:49:12,224 --> 00:49:14,590
I don't want my kids exposed to you.
Come on.

669
00:49:14,659 --> 00:49:17,423
- Let go of me!
- Stop roughhousing that kid right now.

670
00:49:17,496 --> 00:49:19,430
Let go of him.

671
00:49:20,665 --> 00:49:24,157
I don't know how we came from the same
place, 'cause you are not my sister.

672
00:49:24,236 --> 00:49:28,434
You come and put my family in danger?
I'm sorry. Not in my house.

673
00:49:28,507 --> 00:49:32,204
- I don't want this in my house.
- Well, good for you.

674
00:49:32,277 --> 00:49:34,507
You’d treat me better
it I was a stranger.

675
00:49:34,579 --> 00:49:37,776
- Sometimes I wish you were.
- Done.

676
00:49:37,849 --> 00:49:41,376
Get out of here!
I don't want you in the building.

677
00:49:42,587 --> 00:49:45,454
- Gosh, she's mean.
- No kiddin'

678
00:49:45,524 --> 00:49:48,220
She's ugly too.

679
00:49:48,293 --> 00:49:49,783
Yeah?

680
00:49:49,861 --> 00:49:54,127
Well, not everybody's as lucky
in the looks department as you and me.

681
00:49:54,199 --> 00:49:56,133
She makes a hell of a meat loaf.

682
00:49:59,337 --> 00:50:01,464
- What about the kid?
- He's under five.

683
00:50:01,540 --> 00:50:04,134
No, I'm not. I'm seven.

684
00:50:09,881 --> 00:50:12,873
Anybody got two quarters?

685
00:50:16,421 --> 00:50:19,481
- A ten spot for two quarters.
- I got it.

686
00:50:21,660 --> 00:50:23,992
- Aren't you nice.
- Any time.

687
00:50:29,734 --> 00:50:32,259
You should learn
to keep your mouth shut.

688
00:50:37,842 --> 00:50:40,276
What are you doing?

689
00:50:40,345 --> 00:50:43,940
- You all right?
- I need a new inhaler.

690
00:50:44,015 --> 00:50:46,347
This?

691
00:50:46,418 --> 00:50:48,648
All right. Okay.

692
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:51,188
We'll get you one.
All right.

693
00:50:54,693 --> 00:50:57,287
- You got any more of these?
- You got a prescription?

694
00:50:57,362 --> 00:50:59,159
I lost it.

695
00:50:59,230 --> 00:51:01,630
- I can't do it without a prescription.
- But he can't breathe.

696
00:51:01,700 --> 00:51:03,964
- I can breathe. I have asthma.
- Shut up.

697
00:51:04,035 --> 00:51:07,266
- You're so rude.
- Shut up or I let you choke.

698
00:51:07,339 --> 00:51:10,740
- Come on. The kid can't breathe.
- Sorry. Not without a prescription.

699
00:51:13,712 --> 00:51:16,044
Let me look for it again.

700
00:51:17,949 --> 00:51:19,348
I found it.

701
00:51:20,752 --> 00:51:23,687
I can't make out
the doctor's signature.

702
00:51:30,829 --> 00:51:33,889
It's Dr. Benjamin Franklin.

703
00:51:40,538 --> 00:51:42,836
The druggist in my neighborhood...

704
00:51:42,907 --> 00:51:45,808
gives it to me
without a prescription.

705
00:51:45,877 --> 00:51:48,812
That guy was just screwing you.

706
00:51:48,880 --> 00:51:50,814
You think so?

707
00:51:53,852 --> 00:51:55,945
Thanks a lot.

708
00:51:56,021 --> 00:51:57,283
I can open it.

709
00:51:57,355 --> 00:52:00,085
- Where are we going?
- Shopping.

710
00:52:00,158 --> 00:52:01,318
Why?

711
00:52:01,393 --> 00:52:04,021
'Cause you smell, and I'm tired
of looking at you in those clothes.

712
00:52:04,095 --> 00:52:07,326
- What am I going to do with you?
- Don't worry about me.

713
00:52:07,399 --> 00:52:10,095
Oh, yeah, don't worry about you.
That's right. You know what?

714
00:52:10,168 --> 00:52:13,934
You're driving me crazy.
Don't speak. Don't say anything.

715
00:52:14,005 --> 00:52:18,032
'Cause I'm running out of time,
money and patience.

716
00:52:20,545 --> 00:52:24,003
Hey, where’d you get that toy?
You don't steal when you're with me.

717
00:52:24,082 --> 00:52:27,518
What, are you nuts?
You trying to get us arrested here?

718
00:52:27,585 --> 00:52:29,519
It's none of your business
what I do.

719
00:52:29,587 --> 00:52:33,717
You don't listen, and worst of all, you
don't know when to admit you're wrong.

720
00:52:34,826 --> 00:52:37,124
Don't tell me what to do.
It puts me down.

721
00:52:37,195 --> 00:52:39,129
I'm the man.
I tell you what to do.

722
00:52:39,197 --> 00:52:43,327
- I don't fuckin' like how you talk.
- You have a filthy mouth.

723
00:52:43,401 --> 00:52:46,768
You listen to me, you little punk.
You're just a little kid. Act like it.

724
00:52:46,838 --> 00:52:49,932
- Jesus Christ, you're five years old.
- I'm seven! I'm not a baby.

725
00:52:50,008 --> 00:52:51,669
I'm a man. I'm the man.

726
00:52:51,743 --> 00:52:54,268
You are not the man.
You are the boy.

727
00:52:54,345 --> 00:52:57,542
You listen to me.
You go to school, men go to work.

728
00:52:57,615 --> 00:52:59,879
You got no hair on your face,
men do.

729
00:52:59,951 --> 00:53:02,647
You got a small pee-pee,
men got big pee-pees... some of them.

730
00:53:02,721 --> 00:53:05,155
Hopefully,
one day you will too.

731
00:53:05,223 --> 00:53:07,919
You are not the man.
You are a boy.

732
00:53:11,396 --> 00:53:15,856
Here. You take this, put it away.
I don't wanna see it again.

733
00:53:15,934 --> 00:53:18,630
Don't be a little thief.

734
00:53:18,703 --> 00:53:21,171
Come on! Hey, this way.

735
00:53:48,266 --> 00:53:50,200
- Miss.
- Do I look like a miss to you?

736
00:53:50,268 --> 00:53:53,362
I got a kid with me here.
I need a room.

737
00:53:53,438 --> 00:53:56,930
- Sixty-five bucks a night.
- You wash the sheets?

738
00:53:57,008 --> 00:53:58,942
Every summer.

739
00:54:11,556 --> 00:54:15,048
It's not so bad as it looks.

740
00:54:15,126 --> 00:54:17,060
I've seen better.

741
00:54:17,128 --> 00:54:18,561
True.

742
00:54:19,664 --> 00:54:21,598
Possibly true.

743
00:54:27,305 --> 00:54:29,569
You got pretty big feet
for a girl.

744
00:54:29,641 --> 00:54:32,405
What, are you tryin'
to win me over?

745
00:54:34,579 --> 00:54:37,742
Christ!
Kevin... what a chump.

746
00:54:39,150 --> 00:54:42,745
All my pictures,
all my perfume...

747
00:54:42,821 --> 00:54:44,755
my shoes.

748
00:54:46,257 --> 00:54:47,690
Dresses.

749
00:54:49,460 --> 00:54:52,918
- I had a really nice coat.
- So you could buy more.

750
00:54:52,997 --> 00:54:57,093
Oh, yeah, 'cause I'm so rich.

751
00:54:57,168 --> 00:54:59,762
Sure.
Sure, you're rich.

752
00:54:59,838 --> 00:55:01,931
Yeah, I really blew it.

753
00:55:06,144 --> 00:55:10,080
You know, women got
the greatest deal in the world.

754
00:55:10,148 --> 00:55:13,447
All they gotta do
is fall in love...

755
00:55:13,518 --> 00:55:16,078
and some guy just
takes care of 'em, you know?

756
00:55:16,154 --> 00:55:20,090
Look at Brenda. She makes a so-so
meat loaf and ends up on Central Park.

757
00:55:22,460 --> 00:55:24,553
I had chances, you know?

758
00:55:24,629 --> 00:55:26,563
Some guys liked me.

759
00:55:27,832 --> 00:55:31,324
Christ, I had more boyfriends
than I can remember.

760
00:55:31,402 --> 00:55:33,233
Tall.

761
00:55:33,304 --> 00:55:36,364
Some of them were tall.
Some of them were short and tat.

762
00:55:36,441 --> 00:55:39,877
They were funny.
I don't need much.

763
00:55:41,446 --> 00:55:44,381
Just give me a guy
who likes to win...

764
00:55:46,084 --> 00:55:48,382
and I'm happy.

765
00:55:48,453 --> 00:55:51,115
That's it.

766
00:55:51,189 --> 00:55:53,817
Just some guy who likes to win.

767
00:55:55,293 --> 00:55:57,227
It's enough, you know.

768
00:56:03,201 --> 00:56:05,260
Threw my life away...

769
00:56:05,336 --> 00:56:07,133
for nothin'

770
00:56:07,205 --> 00:56:09,673
You would have really
liked my cat.

771
00:56:11,876 --> 00:56:14,344
Excuse me. What the hell
do you think you're doin'

772
00:56:14,412 --> 00:56:17,074
Where’d you get those?
Wise guy.

773
00:56:17,148 --> 00:56:21,141
- Hey, sometimes I smoke.
- Sometimes you smoke?

774
00:56:21,219 --> 00:56:23,710
You're six years old.
Smoke when you're ten.

775
00:56:23,788 --> 00:56:26,848
And you've got asthma.
What, are you nuts?

776
00:56:33,498 --> 00:56:35,432
Forget it.

777
00:56:42,373 --> 00:56:44,739
Wham. Yeah.

778
00:56:44,809 --> 00:56:46,242
<i>Quiet!</i>

779
00:56:52,317 --> 00:56:54,615
It's Gloria.
Is he there?

780
00:57:02,393 --> 00:57:04,361
Where are ya?

781
00:57:05,596 --> 00:57:08,030
Kevin, I'm in trouble again.

782
00:57:09,100 --> 00:57:11,034
I wanna know why.

783
00:57:16,674 --> 00:57:19,734
This kid is drivin' me nuts, and I don't
know what I'm supposed to do with him.

784
00:57:21,779 --> 00:57:23,713
Come on, Gloria.

785
00:57:26,217 --> 00:57:30,119
<i>That kid means nothin' to you.
Come on.</i>

786
00:57:40,965 --> 00:57:43,957
<i>A gangland killing
today in Washington Heights.</i>

787
00:57:44,035 --> 00:57:47,766
<i>Police say 35-year-old Jack Nuñez,
his wife, Angela...</i>

788
00:57:47,839 --> 00:57:51,036
<i>his ten-year-old daughter
and his mother-in-law, Maria Estevez...</i>

789
00:57:51,109 --> 00:57:54,237
<i>were gunned down in their apartment
and pronounced dead at the scene.</i>

790
00:57:54,312 --> 00:57:56,610
<i>But there's more to this story.</i>

791
00:57:56,681 --> 00:57:59,650
<i>Seven-year-old
Nicholas Nuñez is missing.</i>

792
00:57:59,717 --> 00:58:02,277
<i>Police are asking anyone
with any information...</i>

793
00:58:02,353 --> 00:58:04,412
- <i>regarding Nicholas' whereabouts...</i>
- Kid!

794
00:58:04,489 --> 00:58:06,650
<i>to give them a call.</i>

795
00:58:06,724 --> 00:58:08,715
Kid, what are you...
Kid, where are you goin'

796
00:58:08,793 --> 00:58:11,489
<i>There's an investigation
into what appears to be an execution.</i>

797
00:58:24,108 --> 00:58:25,541
Nicky!

798
00:58:40,725 --> 00:58:43,956
- Shit!
- Hey! Hey! Come back here!

799
00:58:46,564 --> 00:58:51,194
Hey, stop it!
Come on, lady! Don't make me do this!

800
00:58:51,269 --> 00:58:53,203
Hey, lady! Come on! Wait!

801
00:58:53,271 --> 00:58:55,569
Nick, where are you goin'
You stupid kid!

802
00:58:55,640 --> 00:58:58,040
- Hey, mister!
- Hold on!

803
00:58:58,109 --> 00:59:01,340
- Mister, you gotta stop the train!
- Hold up, lady!

804
00:59:01,412 --> 00:59:03,903
- Mister, stop the train!
- Hold up!

805
00:59:03,981 --> 00:59:06,449
- Let go of me!
- Calm down! Calm down!

806
00:59:06,517 --> 00:59:08,451
- Let go of me!
- Calm down!

807
00:59:08,519 --> 00:59:11,545
Calm down! Calm down!

808
00:59:11,622 --> 00:59:13,852
That's my kid!
That's my kid on the train!

809
00:59:13,925 --> 00:59:17,725
You know where he's goin'
Tell me. Talk to me.

810
00:59:17,795 --> 00:59:20,559
- 158th Street!
- 158th Street.

811
01:00:03,908 --> 01:00:07,708
You crazy kid.
You scared me half to death.

812
01:00:07,778 --> 01:00:10,338
What's the matter with you, huh?

813
01:01:00,831 --> 01:01:02,765
Did it happen?

814
01:01:03,834 --> 01:01:05,927
Are they dead?

815
01:01:06,003 --> 01:01:08,403
Did everything really happen?

816
01:01:11,943 --> 01:01:13,968
- Yeah.
- No!

817
01:01:14,045 --> 01:01:16,809
- I hate you.
- That's okay.

818
01:01:16,881 --> 01:01:19,281
You can hate me right now.

819
01:01:19,350 --> 01:01:23,343
I want my mommy. I want my papi.
I want to go find them.

820
01:01:26,290 --> 01:01:28,224
You know, Nicky...

821
01:01:30,828 --> 01:01:35,663
you can't even believe how much
I understand how you feel.

822
01:01:36,734 --> 01:01:38,668
'Cause my mom and dad...

823
01:01:43,774 --> 01:01:46,902
Well, your mom and dad...
They love you.

824
01:01:48,279 --> 01:01:51,680
And because they love you...

825
01:01:52,750 --> 01:01:56,584
you can always talk to them...

826
01:01:56,654 --> 01:01:59,179
you know,
just like they were there.

827
01:02:01,592 --> 01:02:04,527
And they'll always
be there for ya.

828
01:02:09,367 --> 01:02:11,733
You just...

829
01:02:11,802 --> 01:02:14,498
You can't go find 'em, you know?

830
01:02:17,775 --> 01:02:19,970
I know it's hard to understand.

831
01:02:23,414 --> 01:02:24,847
Because...

832
01:02:27,151 --> 01:02:29,210
Well, you'll understand one day.
You will.

833
01:02:29,287 --> 01:02:31,778
When you grow up...

834
01:02:31,856 --> 01:02:34,757
It's just hard right now,
because you're so little.

835
01:02:34,825 --> 01:02:38,522
I'm seven. How many times
do I have to tell you that, lady?

836
01:02:38,596 --> 01:02:40,723
- I know.
- And I'm the man. I say what to do.

837
01:02:44,168 --> 01:02:47,137
I'm sorry. I know you are.

838
01:02:47,204 --> 01:02:49,934
You're the man, all right?

839
01:02:50,007 --> 01:02:53,033
Now, don't get
so upset about it. Just...

840
01:02:57,248 --> 01:02:59,182
I wanna go home.

841
01:03:02,720 --> 01:03:06,486
There's no one there, baby.

842
01:03:12,263 --> 01:03:15,755
Why don't you try
and go to sleep now, all right?

843
01:03:15,833 --> 01:03:18,700
Okay? You just try to...

844
01:03:19,770 --> 01:03:23,069
You want me
to sing you a little song?

845
01:03:24,141 --> 01:03:25,574
Huh?

846
01:04:11,989 --> 01:04:13,422
Mommy?

847
01:04:44,655 --> 01:04:46,486
Where's Jesse?

848
01:04:46,557 --> 01:04:48,718
He died two years ago.
Who are you?

849
01:04:48,793 --> 01:04:50,522
An old friend.
And who are you?

850
01:04:50,594 --> 01:04:52,619
I'm his son, Freddie.

851
01:04:53,964 --> 01:04:57,764
- He was a good guy, your dad.
- Yeah, yeah.

852
01:04:57,835 --> 01:05:00,201
Look...

853
01:05:03,641 --> 01:05:07,304
I got about 50,000 here.
I'll take five.

854
01:05:07,378 --> 01:05:10,973
Oh, you will, will ya? Yeah, but
I got to look at this stuff first, okay?

855
01:05:11,048 --> 01:05:12,982
Your father never
had to look at anything.

856
01:05:13,050 --> 01:05:13,982
Yeah, well?

857
01:05:14,051 --> 01:05:16,713
This used to be like
a home away from home to my jewelry.

858
01:05:16,787 --> 01:05:19,051
Not to mention my furs.

859
01:05:19,123 --> 01:05:21,614
Hello? I got a bus to catch here.
I don't have all day.

860
01:05:21,692 --> 01:05:23,853
What? You got ten Rolexes here.
Come on. Let's go.

861
01:05:24,595 --> 01:05:26,256
All right.

862
01:05:39,910 --> 01:05:41,878
Thanks a lot.
Pleasure doin' business with ya.

863
01:05:41,946 --> 01:05:43,880
- Excuse me.
- You sign for me.

864
01:06:04,668 --> 01:06:06,260
Let me talk to Kevin.

865
01:06:06,337 --> 01:06:08,271
Raymond, bring the phone book.

866
01:06:08,339 --> 01:06:10,864
She's in Hell's Kitchen.
Check those tourist hotels.

867
01:06:10,941 --> 01:06:14,877
And keep callin'. We're gettin' there.
We are gettin' there.

868
01:06:31,662 --> 01:06:34,529
Kid? Kid, come on.

869
01:06:34,598 --> 01:06:38,398
Come on. Get up.
Those guys are outside. Come here.

870
01:06:38,469 --> 01:06:40,664
Look. Come here.

871
01:06:40,738 --> 01:06:42,763
We gotta get dressed.
I gotta get you outta here, all right?

872
01:06:42,840 --> 01:06:45,900
They wanna hurt us.
Give me your foot. Give me your foot.

873
01:06:49,713 --> 01:06:51,681
You want me to hold
the disk for ya?

874
01:06:51,749 --> 01:06:53,944
Disk, disk. Where's my disk?

875
01:06:54,018 --> 01:06:56,452
- I want my disk. Please.
- Come on.

876
01:07:00,925 --> 01:07:04,952
- Nice to see you, Sean.
- Fuck you, Gloria. This game is over.

877
01:07:05,029 --> 01:07:07,122
Yeah?

878
01:07:08,198 --> 01:07:09,756
This look familiar to you?

879
01:07:09,833 --> 01:07:12,358
It should. It's yours.

880
01:07:12,436 --> 01:07:14,961
It's got a silencer on it.

881
01:07:15,039 --> 01:07:17,007
You remember how easy it kills,
ya bastard.

882
01:07:18,609 --> 01:07:20,702
Go over there by the wall!

883
01:07:21,745 --> 01:07:23,372
Get over there by the wall!

884
01:07:24,114 --> 01:07:25,945
Get over there!

885
01:07:26,016 --> 01:07:27,984
Get your hands out of your pockets
where I can see 'em.

886
01:07:28,052 --> 01:07:30,680
Go on. Get back there.

887
01:07:30,754 --> 01:07:32,119
I mean it.

888
01:07:32,189 --> 01:07:34,180
Keep goin' Against the wall.

889
01:07:36,894 --> 01:07:39,522
All right, kid.
Get in the car.

890
01:07:39,597 --> 01:07:42,361
You're dead meat, Gloria.
Dead meat.

891
01:07:42,433 --> 01:07:43,957
Dead meat.

892
01:07:53,544 --> 01:07:56,342
- Bitch!
- Let go of me, ya fuck!

893
01:07:56,413 --> 01:08:01,077
- Ya bitch! Bitch!
- What are you? Crazy?

894
01:09:15,459 --> 01:09:16,892
Hold on!

895
01:10:23,527 --> 01:10:24,824
Hold on!

896
01:11:07,571 --> 01:11:10,096
Are you okay?

897
01:11:10,174 --> 01:11:12,233
Yeah. I'm okay.

898
01:11:13,544 --> 01:11:16,945
- You looked scared.
- I don't get scared. I get pissed oft!

899
01:11:17,014 --> 01:11:19,107
Then why do you look scared?

900
01:11:19,183 --> 01:11:22,710
Well, of course I'm scared! For
God's sake, give me a break here, right?

901
01:11:22,786 --> 01:11:26,415
If you think I'm scared of those morons,
I'm not, all right?

902
01:11:26,490 --> 01:11:27,889
I'm hungry.

903
01:11:29,526 --> 01:11:31,460
Look at the crap
you've gotten me into.

904
01:11:32,296 --> 01:11:36,426
- What did I do?
- Everything. Put your hat on.

905
01:11:40,971 --> 01:11:44,463
- I gotta pee.
- Me too.

906
01:11:45,609 --> 01:11:47,201
Okay. Come on.

907
01:12:35,759 --> 01:12:37,590
Mommy?

908
01:12:41,732 --> 01:12:45,293
I had a dream
about you last night.

909
01:12:45,369 --> 01:12:49,533
I wish I can see you.
Can you see me?

910
01:12:56,480 --> 01:12:59,506
Would you like me
to hear confession?

911
01:13:01,251 --> 01:13:03,651
- I'm not exactly...
- All right.

912
01:13:03,720 --> 01:13:06,814
It's been a long time
since I've done confession, Father.

913
01:13:06,890 --> 01:13:08,983
So, no, thanks.

914
01:13:09,993 --> 01:13:11,517
Father?

915
01:13:13,230 --> 01:13:16,358
I... I'm sorry.

916
01:13:16,433 --> 01:13:21,268
It's just that I've never been
too comfortable in those things.

917
01:13:21,338 --> 01:13:25,934
It's still, like, confidential
if we do it out here, right?

918
01:13:26,009 --> 01:13:27,442
Yes.

919
01:13:29,947 --> 01:13:34,247
It's... You know, maybe
you could tell me what to do.

920
01:13:37,354 --> 01:13:40,152
I got this kid.
He's not my kid.

921
01:13:40,223 --> 01:13:42,487
I just kind of got involved with him.
His whole family's dead.

922
01:13:42,559 --> 01:13:46,188
He's got nobody. You know,
so I got stuck with him.

923
01:13:47,631 --> 01:13:49,394
It's that kid over there.

924
01:13:51,134 --> 01:13:54,069
This is between us, right?

925
01:13:54,137 --> 01:13:56,503
He's got these guys...
They want to kill him.

926
01:13:56,573 --> 01:13:59,167
Now, I know these guys.
They used to be my friends.

927
01:13:59,242 --> 01:14:01,642
So they let me walk away.
I mean, I could get away.

928
01:14:01,712 --> 01:14:04,237
They won't do anything to me.
But this kid... He's drivin' me nuts.

929
01:14:04,314 --> 01:14:07,579
I can't take care of him. I mean,
he's a good kid, but he's not my family.

930
01:14:07,651 --> 01:14:11,519
I don't want him dead,
and I don't know what to do with him.

931
01:14:11,588 --> 01:14:15,615
I gotta be back in Miami on Monday,
because I just got outta jail and...

932
01:14:15,692 --> 01:14:18,422
- Okay, okay, okay. All right.
- Yeah?

933
01:14:18,495 --> 01:14:23,228
Hold on. Start at the beginning.
Maybe I can do something for you.

934
01:14:36,813 --> 01:14:39,145
Timmy, it looks like we got it.

935
01:14:39,216 --> 01:14:41,582
Harry, Paul, Queen, 8-6-3.

936
01:14:41,651 --> 01:14:44,142
That's H-P-Q-8-6-3.

937
01:14:46,323 --> 01:14:48,689
Guinness. Thanks.

938
01:14:49,860 --> 01:14:53,455
No, I'll take care of it.
Leave it to me.

939
01:14:58,802 --> 01:15:01,134
- Yeah?
- Kevin, we got the car.

940
01:15:01,204 --> 01:15:02,569
Where?

941
01:15:03,640 --> 01:15:06,609
Thank you, Michael.
I owe ya.

942
01:15:06,676 --> 01:15:09,804
128th and St. Nick's.

943
01:15:18,188 --> 01:15:22,750
Come back in half an hour.
I might have something for you.

944
01:15:22,826 --> 01:15:25,954
Okay. Get your hat.

945
01:15:26,029 --> 01:15:27,462
Come on.

946
01:15:30,600 --> 01:15:32,534
Thanks a lot.

947
01:15:39,209 --> 01:15:42,201
- I'm hungry.
- No kiddin'

948
01:15:47,551 --> 01:15:50,349
Coffee, black.
What do you want?

949
01:15:50,420 --> 01:15:55,016
A Coke and chocolate cake.

950
01:15:55,092 --> 01:15:59,028
- For breakfast?
- Yeah, a Coke and a cake. Are ya deaf?

951
01:16:03,300 --> 01:16:07,066
- You're so tough.
- It's all an act, kid.

952
01:16:12,375 --> 01:16:15,833
- Do you like me?
- Yeah, kid, I like you.

953
01:16:15,912 --> 01:16:20,372
- Do you love me?
- I don't even know you.

954
01:16:20,450 --> 01:16:24,887
Listen, I gotta talk to you like
you're a big guy now, all right?

955
01:16:24,955 --> 01:16:26,980
- Yeah.
- Like you're all grown up.

956
01:16:27,057 --> 01:16:30,584
- You know the priest we just talked to?
- Yeah.

957
01:16:30,660 --> 01:16:33,390
He just told me about this school,
upstate, for boys.

958
01:16:33,463 --> 01:16:36,830
Supposed to be real nice.
Lots of trees, animals.

959
01:16:36,900 --> 01:16:39,494
- You like animals?
- I hate animals.

960
01:16:39,569 --> 01:16:41,537
So you stay away from 'em.

961
01:16:43,406 --> 01:16:45,704
- You're getting rid of me.
- You'll be sate there.

962
01:16:45,775 --> 01:16:49,575
I'm not going to some stupid,
dumb school where I don't know anyone.

963
01:16:49,646 --> 01:16:52,240
You don't understand, all right?

964
01:16:52,315 --> 01:16:55,478
Now, we gotta get outta Manhattan
before they find us.

965
01:16:55,552 --> 01:16:58,385
And I gotta get back to Miami
before they chuck me back in jail.

966
01:16:58,455 --> 01:17:02,289
Which means what? That I gotta
find something to do with you.

967
01:17:03,260 --> 01:17:04,852
You got that?

968
01:17:04,928 --> 01:17:09,194
Christ! You're the only kid I ever met
who makes a big deal out of breathing.

969
01:17:09,266 --> 01:17:10,699
The Coke is for him.

970
01:17:10,767 --> 01:17:13,258
Is that what your brains tells you?

971
01:17:13,336 --> 01:17:16,237
Listen, kid, I understand
your situation, all right?

972
01:17:16,306 --> 01:17:18,968
And I wouldn't trade places with you
for all the tea in China.

973
01:17:19,042 --> 01:17:22,102
But it is what it is,
and we gotta deal with it.

974
01:17:23,580 --> 01:17:25,946
How can I make ya understand?

975
01:17:26,016 --> 01:17:28,780
They're tryin' to kill us. We could
be dead by tonight. Eat your cake.

976
01:17:34,925 --> 01:17:36,222
What?

977
01:17:36,293 --> 01:17:38,227
Oh, come on. What's with
the snifflin' over there?

978
01:17:38,895 --> 01:17:42,888
Would ya knock it oft, huh?
Would you knock it...

979
01:17:42,966 --> 01:17:46,231
Would you stop your cryin'

980
01:17:46,303 --> 01:17:47,930
Come on.

981
01:17:48,004 --> 01:17:50,939
Everything I say is wrong, all right?
I don't have any kids.

982
01:17:51,007 --> 01:17:54,636
I never even liked kids, all right?
I never liked kids.

983
01:17:54,711 --> 01:17:57,908
Just shut up.
You talk too much.

984
01:17:57,981 --> 01:18:00,313
Will ya listen to me, Nicky?

985
01:18:05,422 --> 01:18:08,914
Life is a dream.
It only lasts a minute.

986
01:18:08,992 --> 01:18:12,826
And there's lots of people,
lots of stupid people...

987
01:18:12,896 --> 01:18:15,763
lots of jerky people,
lots of idiots.

988
01:18:17,767 --> 01:18:21,533
I won't care it I die today,
but you... You're different.

989
01:18:21,605 --> 01:18:24,438
You're a kid. You can't
even reach the urinal yet.

990
01:18:24,507 --> 01:18:27,135
You got all kinds of things...

991
01:18:27,210 --> 01:18:29,144
You got a lot
of lovemakin' to make.

992
01:18:29,212 --> 01:18:31,146
You got a lot of booze to drink.

993
01:18:31,214 --> 01:18:33,148
You got a lot of growin' up to do.

994
01:18:33,216 --> 01:18:35,047
Look at ya. You're just a...

995
01:18:35,118 --> 01:18:38,576
a teeny little
baby bug thing over there.

996
01:18:40,423 --> 01:18:44,792
You know, I’d like to see you
in a tie one day or a tux.

997
01:18:44,861 --> 01:18:48,058
You know, you could go gambling. You
could. You could hang out with the guys.

998
01:18:48,131 --> 01:18:50,964
You could go to the racetrack.

999
01:18:51,034 --> 01:18:54,834
Chase around some
skinny blonde girl, big boobs.

1000
01:18:54,904 --> 01:18:57,964
There's a lot of things
you could do yet.

1001
01:19:05,949 --> 01:19:08,417
I'm not going to the school.
I'm not.

1002
01:19:08,485 --> 01:19:11,511
What's the matter with you?
You demented or what?

1003
01:19:11,588 --> 01:19:14,250
I'm expressing a philosophy
to you here, all right?

1004
01:19:14,324 --> 01:19:16,258
I'm trying to tell you
what life is all about.

1005
01:19:16,326 --> 01:19:19,227
I'm trying to tell you that when you
grow up, you're gonna be a handsome guy.

1006
01:19:19,296 --> 01:19:22,732
You could have kids of your own. That's
what I'm tryin' to tell ya. Understand?

1007
01:19:22,799 --> 01:19:26,235
I don't wanna go to the racetrack.

1008
01:19:26,303 --> 01:19:28,737
So don't go
to the racetrack, all right?

1009
01:19:31,508 --> 01:19:33,738
Would you breathe some air into your
lungs over there? You're turnin' blue.

1010
01:19:37,447 --> 01:19:38,937
Huh?

1011
01:19:45,155 --> 01:19:50,058
Ask for Father Paul.
He's expecting you at 9:00.

1012
01:19:50,126 --> 01:19:53,118
Thanks. Come on.

1013
01:20:00,270 --> 01:20:02,101
Let's go.

1014
01:20:28,398 --> 01:20:30,491
Shit.

1015
01:20:44,347 --> 01:20:45,279
Jesus.

1016
01:20:48,585 --> 01:20:50,780
- Wait, Nicky!
- Come with me!

1017
01:20:51,554 --> 01:20:52,816
Come this way!

1018
01:20:54,858 --> 01:20:56,086
Hurry!

1019
01:21:00,563 --> 01:21:01,621
Hurry!

1020
01:21:09,939 --> 01:21:14,273
Help! Help! Help!

1021
01:21:15,578 --> 01:21:19,207
- Terry, you bastard!
- Move!

1022
01:21:51,948 --> 01:21:54,143
Oh, fuck.

1023
01:22:05,228 --> 01:22:06,661
Oh, God.

1024
01:22:11,568 --> 01:22:13,195
Oh, God, please.

1025
01:22:18,575 --> 01:22:21,840
- Is Diane here?
- Yeah. Diane!

1026
01:22:21,911 --> 01:22:26,075
Thanks, Diane!
Call us if you need us!

1027
01:22:26,149 --> 01:22:28,344
You guys, you wanna hurry up?
You gonna take all day?

1028
01:22:28,418 --> 01:22:31,182
Clean up this mess.
Let's go. I'm tired.

1029
01:22:31,254 --> 01:22:33,381
- Thanks, Diane.
- Bye, sweetheart.

1030
01:22:35,158 --> 01:22:36,750
Holy-ga-molys.

1031
01:22:47,770 --> 01:22:51,763
Come on in. What happened now?

1032
01:22:51,841 --> 01:22:54,571
- Want some coffee?
- Yeah.

1033
01:22:57,113 --> 01:22:59,547
Sit down.

1034
01:22:59,616 --> 01:23:02,084
Kevin's tryin' to kill me.

1035
01:23:02,151 --> 01:23:04,119
So why should today
be any different?

1036
01:23:04,187 --> 01:23:08,647
No, this time
he's really tryin' to kill me.

1037
01:23:08,725 --> 01:23:10,659
I need to see Ruby.

1038
01:23:15,198 --> 01:23:18,326
What do you want
to see that bastard for?

1039
01:23:18,401 --> 01:23:20,335
- There's this kid.
- A kid?

1040
01:23:20,403 --> 01:23:22,496
Yeah, a kid.
Kevin killed his entire family.

1041
01:23:22,572 --> 01:23:24,665
Now he wants to kill the kid.

1042
01:23:24,741 --> 01:23:28,336
I'm telling you, the first time
I even talk to a kid, I get involved.

1043
01:23:28,411 --> 01:23:31,141
Jesus Christ, this kid,
he's got nobody.

1044
01:23:31,214 --> 01:23:34,741
His whole family's dead.
Just breaks your heart.

1045
01:23:34,817 --> 01:23:37,752
Gloria, what are you thinking?

1046
01:23:37,820 --> 01:23:42,951
Kevin, these guys... They're your
friends. They're your family for life.

1047
01:23:43,026 --> 01:23:46,985
I think Ruby could help me out of this
situation here. Kevin listens to him.

1048
01:23:47,063 --> 01:23:49,759
Because he has to.

1049
01:23:49,832 --> 01:23:53,165
You know, Kevin's
the only person I never trusted.

1050
01:23:53,236 --> 01:23:57,673
But Ruby is always good
to the ones he likes...

1051
01:23:57,740 --> 01:24:01,972
and he always liked you, didn't he?

1052
01:24:03,947 --> 01:24:06,780
- You know where I could find him?
- It's Sunday.

1053
01:24:06,849 --> 01:24:08,817
Where the hell
do you think you can find him?

1054
01:24:08,885 --> 01:24:12,377
I gotta be in Miami tomorrow
to report for parole.

1055
01:24:13,790 --> 01:24:16,588
What the hell are you thinking?

1056
01:24:16,659 --> 01:24:21,221
Go to Miami. Get the hell
outta here and start your life.

1057
01:24:24,367 --> 01:24:26,096
My whole life...

1058
01:24:26,169 --> 01:24:29,332
Every time I should have made a right,
I made a left.

1059
01:24:29,405 --> 01:24:32,670
I fucked up.
I made bad decisions.

1060
01:24:32,742 --> 01:24:34,403
I don't know where it went.

1061
01:24:36,613 --> 01:24:38,672
I want to do the right thing.

1062
01:24:38,748 --> 01:24:42,684
You gotta think about the moments.
Just the moments.

1063
01:24:42,752 --> 01:24:44,413
- Okay.
- A bottle of wine...

1064
01:24:44,487 --> 01:24:48,583
a dinner party,
a boat ride, a ranch mink.

1065
01:24:48,658 --> 01:24:51,752
Something soft and furry.

1066
01:24:51,828 --> 01:24:55,423
These are the things
you gotta remember.

1067
01:24:55,498 --> 01:24:57,796
Those are the things I remember.

1068
01:24:57,867 --> 01:25:00,335
It's what keeps you sane.

1069
01:25:02,572 --> 01:25:04,767
You always had it together.

1070
01:25:05,975 --> 01:25:08,068
I got my business, okay?

1071
01:25:08,144 --> 01:25:12,171
That's what I got.
I got my girls. I got my guys.

1072
01:25:12,248 --> 01:25:14,716
That's my life, you know?

1073
01:25:14,784 --> 01:25:17,776
I'm seein' a guy.
He's a Jew, but he's a good guy.

1074
01:25:22,525 --> 01:25:24,720
I used to wanna be you.

1075
01:25:25,428 --> 01:25:27,123
I know.

1076
01:25:31,000 --> 01:25:36,370
You can't go see Ruby looking like that.
Let's get you dressed. Come on.

1077
01:25:43,613 --> 01:25:45,547
- Nothin'
- Yeah.

1078
01:25:47,950 --> 01:25:51,909
She's got it.
That selfish bitch.

1079
01:25:51,988 --> 01:25:55,446
She said she's not scared of you
and she'll blow your damn heads oft!

1080
01:25:55,525 --> 01:25:59,120
Kid, you're givin' me the biggest
fuckin' headache I ever had, so shut up.

1081
01:26:00,229 --> 01:26:02,322
What you want to do with him?

1082
01:26:04,300 --> 01:26:07,292
Throw him in the closet.
We're gonna need him.

1083
01:26:09,038 --> 01:26:11,939
Let me go! Get your hands off me!

1084
01:26:14,610 --> 01:26:18,102
- Hey, I'm not goin' in there!
- Get in the fuckin' closet.

1085
01:26:30,727 --> 01:26:31,989
Here's the keys.

1086
01:26:33,296 --> 01:26:35,526
I hope she starts.
She's a bit like me.

1087
01:26:35,598 --> 01:26:38,624
You gotta be real nice to her,
or else she ain't gonna turn over.

1088
01:26:44,273 --> 01:26:46,104
I love ya.

1089
01:27:02,525 --> 01:27:06,256
You're still the sexiest man alive.

1090
01:27:13,102 --> 01:27:15,593
People are lookin' for you.

1091
01:27:15,671 --> 01:27:17,161
I know.

1092
01:27:24,147 --> 01:27:27,844
Pick a horse.
You always was lucky.

1093
01:27:29,152 --> 01:27:30,585
All right.

1094
01:27:38,528 --> 01:27:39,961
Pick another.

1095
01:27:45,101 --> 01:27:48,662
- This kid?
- The boy doesn't know anything.

1096
01:27:48,738 --> 01:27:51,104
He knows you.

1097
01:27:51,174 --> 01:27:54,610
You know me.
I like to gamble.

1098
01:27:55,912 --> 01:27:58,107
But I don't gamble with people.

1099
01:27:59,182 --> 01:28:02,345
Gloria, things have changed.

1100
01:28:02,418 --> 01:28:07,287
We're not out there hijackin' trucks
anymore or shootin' Wops.

1101
01:28:07,356 --> 01:28:12,453
This is big business.
You're interfering' in very high stakes.

1102
01:28:12,528 --> 01:28:14,689
I didn't know you was
involved with this.

1103
01:28:14,764 --> 01:28:16,698
Shit, Ruby, I swear.
I swear to God.

1104
01:28:16,766 --> 01:28:18,757
I did not know you was
involved with this.

1105
01:28:20,736 --> 01:28:23,728
- You have the disk?
- Yeah.

1106
01:28:25,608 --> 01:28:28,202
It's somewhere sate.

1107
01:28:30,947 --> 01:28:33,609
You're gonna kill me?

1108
01:28:33,683 --> 01:28:36,174
What are you sayin'

1109
01:28:36,252 --> 01:28:38,243
I made love with ya.

1110
01:28:38,321 --> 01:28:42,883
I bought you things, jewels and...

1111
01:28:42,959 --> 01:28:45,291
We can't have somethin'
like this threaten us.

1112
01:28:45,361 --> 01:28:48,262
The boy doesn't know anything.

1113
01:28:48,331 --> 01:28:50,561
He's a...

1114
01:28:50,633 --> 01:28:54,091
He's a very smart
and ingenuous guy.

1115
01:28:55,571 --> 01:28:58,165
I could see him doin'
somethin' with his life.

1116
01:29:00,977 --> 01:29:06,609
I have 11 kids,
and I love 'em all.

1117
01:29:06,682 --> 01:29:10,118
I love their mothers too.
I understand this mother thing.

1118
01:29:10,186 --> 01:29:13,952
You're a woman.
He's a little boy.

1119
01:29:14,023 --> 01:29:19,120
You tall in love.
All women are mothers, right?

1120
01:29:19,195 --> 01:29:20,787
But you...

1121
01:29:22,198 --> 01:29:23,790
You're not a mother.

1122
01:29:24,734 --> 01:29:27,464
No, I'm not a mother.

1123
01:29:27,536 --> 01:29:29,333
I've always been a broad.

1124
01:29:29,405 --> 01:29:33,000
So how you gonna
take care of the kid?

1125
01:29:33,075 --> 01:29:36,306
I'll work. I'll get a job.
I can take care of him.

1126
01:29:37,213 --> 01:29:41,115
- You never worked a day in your life.
- I worked every day of my life.

1127
01:29:42,451 --> 01:29:45,113
What are you doin'

1128
01:29:46,355 --> 01:29:50,291
You're a smart girl.
You're actin' very stupid.

1129
01:29:50,359 --> 01:29:54,056
You got a lot of life left.

1130
01:29:55,731 --> 01:29:58,291
Why did you come here?

1131
01:29:58,367 --> 01:30:02,997
I don't trust Kevin.
I can't trust him.

1132
01:30:04,073 --> 01:30:07,338
I wanna make a deal with you.

1133
01:30:10,613 --> 01:30:14,515
I'll give you the disk.
You tell Kevin to give me the kid.

1134
01:30:16,385 --> 01:30:21,789
Look, I got this kid
in a school upstate, St. Lawrence.

1135
01:30:21,857 --> 01:30:26,226
He'll be gone.
I'll disappear.

1136
01:30:26,295 --> 01:30:28,388
You'll never hear
from either one of us again.

1137
01:30:32,234 --> 01:30:34,259
Call Kevin oft.

1138
01:30:35,805 --> 01:30:38,501
All right.

1139
01:30:38,574 --> 01:30:40,508
I'll talk to him.

1140
01:30:42,979 --> 01:30:44,970
It's your lucky day.

1141
01:30:46,349 --> 01:30:51,252
Ruby, I need you to be there
when I give him the disk.

1142
01:30:52,688 --> 01:30:54,883
You gotta be there.

1143
01:30:56,492 --> 01:30:58,756
You got it.

1144
01:31:08,037 --> 01:31:09,971
I never should have let you go.

1145
01:31:54,517 --> 01:31:55,984
Where's the disk?

1146
01:31:58,287 --> 01:31:59,948
The kid first.

1147
01:32:02,191 --> 01:32:03,590
The disk first.

1148
01:32:03,659 --> 01:32:06,822
It ya ever loved me...

1149
01:32:08,297 --> 01:32:11,528
if ya ever want to be the man
you used to be...

1150
01:32:11,600 --> 01:32:13,431
let him go.

1151
01:32:15,171 --> 01:32:16,263
Please?

1152
01:32:17,206 --> 01:32:19,606
Leave us alone.

1153
01:32:20,709 --> 01:32:23,303
Take the boy and go.

1154
01:32:39,128 --> 01:32:40,891
Come on, kid.

1155
01:33:20,669 --> 01:33:22,830
Okay?

1156
01:33:22,905 --> 01:33:24,532
Is it?

1157
01:33:28,144 --> 01:33:29,771
See ya later.

1158
01:33:53,602 --> 01:33:57,595
Now go on. Go to sleep.
We gotta get up early.

1159
01:34:01,010 --> 01:34:04,810
Good night, Mommy.
Good night, <i>Papi.</i>

1160
01:34:04,880 --> 01:34:07,280
- Gloria?
- Yeah?

1161
01:34:07,349 --> 01:34:10,147
Are you gonna come see me?

1162
01:34:11,220 --> 01:34:13,848
I'm gonna be far away.

1163
01:34:18,394 --> 01:34:23,297
Well, it you weren't tar away,
then would you come and see me?

1164
01:34:24,366 --> 01:34:26,766
Yeah, I think I would.

1165
01:34:28,771 --> 01:34:32,298
I’d like to think I would.

1166
01:34:36,178 --> 01:34:38,942
Nick, I’d like to
clear somethin' up.

1167
01:34:44,587 --> 01:34:46,680
It you wanted me to...

1168
01:34:48,857 --> 01:34:50,825
I could be your mother.

1169
01:34:50,893 --> 01:34:53,953
I mean, you know, you could
think of me like I was your mother.

1170
01:34:54,029 --> 01:34:59,296
You could it you want.
I don't have a mother, so you could.

1171
01:35:01,770 --> 01:35:05,001
I just wanted to clear things up.

1172
01:35:05,074 --> 01:35:08,874
You're my father. You're my mother.
You're my whole family.

1173
01:35:08,944 --> 01:35:12,243
You're my friend.
You're my girlfriend too.

1174
01:35:12,314 --> 01:35:16,444
Well, you know, I think
I could be your family. How's that?

1175
01:35:16,518 --> 01:35:18,110
- Gloria?
- Yeah?

1176
01:35:18,187 --> 01:35:20,621
Do you mind if I face you?

1177
01:35:22,491 --> 01:35:24,584
Whatever makes ya happy.

1178
01:35:24,660 --> 01:35:28,687
- May I touch yours?
- May you touch my what?

1179
01:35:28,764 --> 01:35:32,359
- Your hair, silly.
- I don't like people touchin' my hair.

1180
01:35:32,434 --> 01:35:34,902
- You like me?
- Who could resist you?

1181
01:35:34,970 --> 01:35:40,033
With a body like yours?
It's a pleasure lyin' in bed next to ya.

1182
01:35:40,109 --> 01:35:41,599
- Gloria?
- What?

1183
01:35:41,677 --> 01:35:44,646
- Do you dream about me?
- What are ya doin'

1184
01:35:44,713 --> 01:35:48,877
You tryin' to embarrass me? I outweigh
you by like what? Sixty pounds?

1185
01:35:48,951 --> 01:35:51,886
Give in? Maybe 100.

1186
01:35:54,556 --> 01:35:57,548
You're in for it now, mister.

1187
01:36:13,075 --> 01:36:15,009
Looks nice.

1191
01:36:25,654 --> 01:36:28,555
- That must be one of their classes.
- Must be.

1192
01:36:33,595 --> 01:36:36,962
<i>Those are the kind of boys
you should be friendly with.</i>

1193
01:36:37,032 --> 01:36:38,829
<i>Classy.</i>

1194
01:36:50,779 --> 01:36:52,713

1202
01:38:26,909 --> 01:38:30,242
See? That's the problem with you.
You don't listen.

1203
01:38:30,312 --> 01:38:33,804
It's just the kind of stuff
we've been talkin' about.

1204
01:38:41,056 --> 01:38:44,423

1205
01:38:44,493 --> 01:38:45,721
Okay? Okay.

1206
01:41:13,609 --> 01:41:16,134
I just wanna say good-bye again.

1207
01:41:17,746 --> 01:41:19,475

1208
01:41:19,548 --> 01:41:21,482

- Thank you.

1209
01:41:51,013 --> 01:41:54,073
- Ya like it here?
- I hate it here.

1210
01:41:56,018 --> 01:41:58,578
- You sure?
- Positive.

1211
01:42:02,824 --> 01:42:06,351
- Would ya like to leave?
- Gloria, what are you doing?

1212
01:42:07,829 --> 01:42:12,425
I just... I think that it would
be better it you were with me.

1213
01:42:21,276 --> 01:42:25,235
- I'd feel better.
- Me too.

1214
01:42:25,313 --> 01:42:27,144
Okay.

1215
01:42:28,717 --> 01:42:30,708
Those...

1216
01:42:32,788 --> 01:42:34,983
Those guys are gone.

1217
01:42:35,057 --> 01:42:40,654
So I want you to walk real natural
and get in the car.

1218
01:43:13,128 --> 01:43:15,358
You know, I don't
have much to offer.

1219
01:43:17,365 --> 01:43:22,302
I don't even have an apartment.
I don't know what I'm gonna do with you.

1220
01:43:22,370 --> 01:43:25,339
Well, what about a motel?
We did good in a motel.

1221
01:43:25,407 --> 01:43:27,341
I like sleeping with you.

1222
01:43:28,477 --> 01:43:30,911
You're not the first guy
to tell me that.

1223
01:43:32,614 --> 01:43:37,449
I gotta tell you something. You know,
I don't know anything about children.

1224
01:43:37,519 --> 01:43:40,010
I never even liked children.

1225
01:43:40,088 --> 01:43:42,352
And I don't cook.

1226
01:43:43,725 --> 01:43:46,353
No big deal. Pizza.
We send out.

1227
01:43:46,428 --> 01:43:50,023
You know, you're a regular smart-ass.
You got an answer for everything.

1228
01:43:50,098 --> 01:43:52,794
I told you. I'm the man.

1229
01:43:52,868 --> 01:43:55,803
<i>Ladies and gentlemen,
Continental flight 491...</i>

1230
01:43:55,871 --> 01:43:57,964
- Okay, that's our flight.
- That's us, right?

1231
01:43:58,039 --> 01:44:00,439
Yep. I'll take this.

1232
01:44:00,509 --> 01:44:04,445
All right.
Now, you may be the man...

1233
01:44:04,513 --> 01:44:06,504
but if you get out of line...

1234
01:44:06,581 --> 01:44:08,981
I'll have you on a plane
so fast your head will spin.

1235
01:44:09,050 --> 01:44:11,678
- You got that?
- I won't know what hit me?

1236
01:44:11,753 --> 01:44:13,846
You won't know what hit ya.

1237
01:47:54,433 --> 01:47:54,473
