00:02:06,233 --> 00:02:11,374
Excuse me really Dorothy Walt.
She was a wonderful girl.

2
00:02:11,460 --> 00:02:14,542
Thanks for coming, Al.

3
00:02:42,215 --> 00:02:45,257
<i> "Spectacles, Testicles, Wallet, and Watch" </ i></i>

4
00:02:52,661 --> 00:02:55,722
Look how the old man scandal
Ashley looks to.

5
00:02:55,905 --> 00:02:59,141
He can not even mean
at the funeral, Mom?

6
00:02:59,558 --> 00:03:02,817
What did you expect?
Dad is still living in the'50s.

7
00:03:02,904 --> 00:03:05,368
He expects that his granddaughter
a little more fashionable clothes.

8
00:03:05,454 --> 00:03:09,390
Yes, if your children wear a jersey Timbervolves
I am sure that the AR values.

9
00:03:09,476 --> 00:03:13,824
My point is that nobody can do anything
that the old man would not disappoint.

10
00:03:13,911 --> 00:03:16,272
It is inevitable.

11
00:03:18,358 --> 00:03:20,803
Therefore we do not celebrate together
Thanksgiving.

12
00:03:20,889 --> 00:03:24,421
Remember that deal with the motorboat,
the broken geboortebad,

13
00:03:24,507 --> 00:03:26,364
there is always something with him.

14
00:03:26,449 --> 00:03:27,760
What we need with him?

15
00:03:27,845 --> 00:03:32,912
Do not you think that he is in trouble,
there all alone in the old neighborhood?

16
00:03:34,396 --> 00:03:37,753
Why does he not you withdraw?

17
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:04,767
Death is often a bittersweet event
For us Catholics.

18
00:04:04,853 --> 00:04:07,273
Bitter in the pain.

19
00:04:07,359 --> 00:04:10,494
Sweet in salvation.

20
00:04:10,579 --> 00:04:14,654
Bitter in the pain
which caused the death ...

21
00:04:14,740 --> 00:04:16,873
for their families.

22
00:04:16,959 --> 00:04:22,860
Sweet for those of us
the salvation know that wait.

23
00:04:22,946 --> 00:04:26,828
And some wonder;
"What is death?"

24
00:04:26,914 --> 00:04:29,562
Is this the end?

25
00:04:29,648 --> 00:04:32,226
Or is that the beginning?

26
00:04:32,313 --> 00:04:34,598
And what is life?

27
00:04:34,683 --> 00:04:37,374
What is that thing
that we 'live' call?

28
00:04:37,460 --> 00:04:42,083
All these questions can frustrate
in times like this.

29
00:04:42,170 --> 00:04:45,201
And therefore you need to reverse the Lord.
- Jesus.

30
00:04:45,287 --> 00:04:49,176
Because the Lord is the sweetness.

31
00:05:04,429 --> 00:05:07,300
Is that dad?
- No, that's Grandpa Walt.

32
00:05:07,387 --> 00:05:11,308
Third platoon, Company E,
two in March 1952.

33
00:05:11,395 --> 00:05:14,416
Korea?
- Where is Korea?

34
00:05:18,329 --> 00:05:20,457
There are many people
taken to the funeral, huh?

35
00:05:20,543 --> 00:05:23,257
I think they have heard
that there would be much ham.

36
00:05:23,342 --> 00:05:25,452
I go to the basement
a few chairs to get.

37
00:05:25,537 --> 00:05:27,647
I can do that, Dad.
- No, we need them now,

38
00:05:27,732 --> 00:05:30,647
not next week.

39
00:05:34,359 --> 00:05:37,611
Cool, I've found a medal.
Look at this post.

40
00:05:58,684 --> 00:06:00,869
How long should we stay here?

41
00:06:00,955 --> 00:06:05,046
This slum is hell
for my phone and I bored me.

42
00:06:05,132 --> 00:06:07,648
Ashley, honey, you want Grandpa Walt
help with the chairs?

43
00:06:07,734 --> 00:06:10,702
Me?
- Yes, you. Windscreen, go ahead.

44
00:06:12,588 --> 00:06:17,023
Grandpa Walt, would you help with this ...
These seats?

45
00:06:17,108 --> 00:06:21,543
No, you have probably
just your nails painted.

46
00:06:24,679 --> 00:06:27,823
<i> Grandpa makes me crazy. </ i></i>

47
00:06:30,008 --> 00:06:33,418
Why did you ask me that?

48
00:06:39,494 --> 00:06:42,072
Come on, let's go.

49
00:07:05,985 --> 00:07:09,809
How many swamp rats
you get a room?

50
00:07:28,716 --> 00:07:32,336
Grandpa, when you
that old-timer?

51
00:07:33,517 --> 00:07:36,595
1972.

52
00:07:38,950 --> 00:07:41,079
I never knew you
a cool old car had.

53
00:07:41,165 --> 00:07:46,063
Yes, there is but
before you were born.

54
00:07:46,685 --> 00:07:51,029
What will you do if
you something ...

55
00:07:51,115 --> 00:07:55,096
as die?

56
00:08:01,213 --> 00:08:03,839
What about those retro super bank
you have in your house,

57
00:08:03,924 --> 00:08:05,750
I 've been thinking,
I go next year to the State,

58
00:08:05,836 --> 00:08:11,266
and I think it would be in my room
and I have no furniture.

59
00:08:17,213 --> 00:08:19,667
Oh, God.

60
00:08:23,174 --> 00:08:25,091
Who are you?
- Hi, I'm Tao.

61
00:08:25,177 --> 00:08:27,121
I live next door.
- Come on, say what you have to say.

62
00:08:27,206 --> 00:08:28,348
I ...
- Tell me what you want.

63
00:08:28,435 --> 00:08:32,445
Do you have jumper cables? My uncle is his car ...
- We do not have a jumper.

64
00:08:32,530 --> 00:08:36,919
And have some respect, empty head.
We are here to mourn.

65
00:08:38,205 --> 00:08:40,114
How does the volume, Walt.

66
00:08:40,200 --> 00:08:42,038
Mr. Kowalski.

67
00:08:42,124 --> 00:08:46,509
What?
- Mr. Kowalski, that's my name.

68
00:08:46,696 --> 00:08:49,211
Well, Mr. Kowalski.

69
00:08:49,298 --> 00:08:52,112
Your wife and I were
these last few months is very close.

70
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,902
She asked me to watch over you
when she died.

71
00:08:54,988 --> 00:08:56,612
I told her
that I have my whole flock wake

72
00:08:56,698 --> 00:08:59,883
but she let me promise
I am in the extra holes would hold.

73
00:08:59,970 --> 00:09:02,893
I appreciate the kindness,
you have given to my wife.

74
00:09:02,979 --> 00:09:07,118
Now that you have expressed your peace,
why not go to another sheep?

75
00:09:07,706 --> 00:09:08,974
Good?

76
00:09:09,060 --> 00:09:13,640
Dorothy said specifically that she wanted
that you would confess.

77
00:09:13,726 --> 00:09:16,186
She said she could not remember,
when you last had.

78
00:09:16,272 --> 00:09:19,273
Is that so?
- That's it.

79
00:09:19,859 --> 00:09:23,291
I confess that I never much
have given to the church.

80
00:09:23,377 --> 00:09:25,739
The only reason why I
I was, it was because of her.

81
00:09:25,824 --> 00:09:28,216
And I confess that I have no desire
to confess

82
00:09:28,302 --> 00:09:31,919
to a boy who just
training of the priest comes.

83
00:10:04,296 --> 00:10:08,248
I wish I could help, Dad
but I must go home with the children.

84
00:10:08,334 --> 00:10:11,410
Do not pressure?
- Yes, well, just go ahead.

85
00:10:11,497 --> 00:10:15,208
I still call to hear how it goes.
- Good.

86
00:10:18,839 --> 00:10:21,420
It kills you,
an American car.

87
00:10:21,506 --> 00:10:23,724
Jesus.

88
00:10:23,809 --> 00:10:25,710
Did you see how he looked into the truck?

89
00:10:25,796 --> 00:10:28,878
It's always Rice-Burner this
Jap-buggy that.

90
00:10:28,963 --> 00:10:30,657
Mon her own funeral
he can not let go.

91
00:10:30,744 --> 00:10:33,266
He said nothing this time at least.
- That he did not.

92
00:10:33,352 --> 00:10:36,502
What did you expect, Mitch? The man
has all these years, worked in the Ford factory.

93
00:10:36,589 --> 00:10:37,874
I suppose it was my fault.

94
00:10:37,961 --> 00:10:40,040
Let the rest, okay?

95
00:10:40,127 --> 00:10:44,379
The kids want the radio on.
If your music? Well.

96
00:10:59,799 --> 00:11:02,942
Fucking barbarians.

97
00:11:05,267 --> 00:11:07,745
I have a broken heart pain.

98
00:11:07,831 --> 00:11:11,717
I want my daughter
another man is.

99
00:11:11,803 --> 00:11:15,200
If she marries again
there is another man in the house.

100
00:11:15,584 --> 00:11:19,066
How is that Tao?
The man in the house is here.

101
00:11:19,152 --> 00:11:23,181
Look at him.
He does the dishes.

102
00:11:23,267 --> 00:11:27,331
He does what his sisters
like he does.

103
00:11:27,417 --> 00:11:29,846
How can he ever
man in the house?

104
00:11:29,932 --> 00:11:34,644
Be patient, as he once over,
he is the man in the house.

105
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,743
Really.

106
00:11:43,217 --> 00:11:48,328
Today is a blessed day
the born child.

107
00:11:50,213 --> 00:11:53,596
I offer food to the child-rearing.

108
00:11:53,682 --> 00:11:57,589
I offer clothing
to the body of the child protection.

109
00:11:58,691 --> 00:12:02,304
This child is blessed
with a mother and father.

110
00:12:02,863 --> 00:12:05,040
Oh, spirit of this child,

111
00:12:05,125 --> 00:12:09,083
go back home and not stray.

112
00:12:18,073 --> 00:12:24,080
Go home spirit and soul,
go home.

113
00:12:26,474 --> 00:12:30,256
Have a good life and old.

114
00:12:41,423 --> 00:12:43,253
Jesus.

115
00:12:43,339 --> 00:12:48,257
Polarski would turn in his grave,
if he would see his lawn.

116
00:12:48,806 --> 00:12:52,656
Why are those slit eyes
moved to this neighborhood?

117
00:12:54,665 --> 00:12:59,504
Why is that old white man?

118
00:12:59,589 --> 00:13:03,006
All Americans have moved from the area.

119
00:13:03,093 --> 00:13:04,780
Why are you not yet left?

120
00:13:04,866 --> 00:13:09,528
Why do not deer paramilitary road,
you clumsy figure.

121
00:13:19,636 --> 00:13:22,849
Why do not bark,
are you deaf or something?

122
00:13:24,664 --> 00:13:26,940
Hi, Walt.

123
00:13:27,427 --> 00:13:31,042
I am not a friend of you
Why Walt always called me?

124
00:13:31,128 --> 00:13:33,493
Sorry, Mr.. Kowalski.

125
00:13:33,580 --> 00:13:37,289
Where you wake today, Reverend.
- Nothing.

126
00:13:37,375 --> 00:13:40,036
I came along to see how it went with you.
I have a time not seen in the church.

127
00:13:40,121 --> 00:13:43,713
Now your good deed done again,
why not go back on the road?

128
00:13:43,799 --> 00:13:47,824
I would like to talk to you, Mr.. Kowalski.
- Not in this life, son.

129
00:13:47,911 --> 00:13:49,091
Why?

130
00:13:49,176 --> 00:13:51,439
Do you have a problem with me, Mr. Kowalski?
- That you do not want to know.

131
00:13:51,525 --> 00:13:53,478
No, I do.

132
00:13:53,563 --> 00:13:57,257
I think you have a highly educated,
27 year old virgin, you

133
00:13:57,343 --> 00:14:00,351
who like the
superstitious of old women hold

134
00:14:00,437 --> 00:14:03,595
and promised them eternal life.

135
00:14:19,805 --> 00:14:24,015
Are you a boy or a girl?
I can not say.

136
00:14:24,348 --> 00:14:28,664
Hey, Chicito. Use your glasses?

137
00:14:28,750 --> 00:14:30,928
What are you reading?
Jackass and Rice Stalk?

138
00:14:31,014 --> 00:14:34,937
Yes, fun walk.
- Continue through.

139
00:14:35,023 --> 00:14:39,631
Look at me when I talk to you.
- There is waste your step, man.

140
00:14:43,723 --> 00:14:46,256
What are you looking at, man?

141
00:14:51,743 --> 00:14:55,088
This is my little cousin, there.
- Is that your cousin, man?

142
00:14:55,175 --> 00:14:58,313
That's my little nephew.
- Is he someone down?

143
00:14:58,400 --> 00:15:00,698
No, he is on his own, Smokie.
- Is he solo?

144
00:15:00,784 --> 00:15:04,297
Let us just look
what they are.

145
00:15:10,501 --> 00:15:13,267
I love your sister.

146
00:15:13,353 --> 00:15:16,551
Hey, how are you?
- I talk to you?

147
00:15:16,636 --> 00:15:20,335
I talk to you?
- Transfer yourself.

148
00:15:20,421 --> 00:15:22,935
We can do this now.
- Yes, right now.

149
00:15:23,021 --> 00:15:24,659
Go fuck you back to your own country.

150
00:15:24,745 --> 00:15:26,793
Fuck that, man.
- Yes.

151
00:15:26,979 --> 00:15:30,848
You're a fucking nigger rice.
- Do you have something against Chinese food?

152
00:15:30,935 --> 00:15:35,657
Damn Vietcong swamp rats.
Go back to your fucking rice country.

153
00:15:35,743 --> 00:15:39,959
We get you.
- Windscreen, gas. Outta here!

154
00:15:40,808 --> 00:15:43,062
Tao, let me see what you have.

155
00:15:44,708 --> 00:15:49,035
Tao, come on get in the car.

156
00:15:49,121 --> 00:15:52,570
Tao, get in the car.
- Get in, man, come on.

157
00:15:52,655 --> 00:15:54,914
Tao! Waren fucking Mexicans
to torment you?

158
00:15:55,000 --> 00:15:57,274
Come on, we are just coming up for you.

159
00:15:57,360 --> 00:16:00,567
Tao come on, get in hell.
- What are you doing, man?

160
00:16:00,652 --> 00:16:02,567
Get in the car, man.
Come on.

161
00:16:02,653 --> 00:16:04,924
Two of us, man.

162
00:16:05,010 --> 00:16:08,199
We just come up for you, man.

163
00:16:08,284 --> 00:16:09,499
Come on.

164
00:16:09,585 --> 00:16:12,274
What a bastard.

165
00:16:13,259 --> 00:16:16,128
Come on, Tao.
- Bursting with him, let's go.

166
00:16:16,215 --> 00:16:18,088
Come on.
- Let him crack.

167
00:16:18,176 --> 00:16:19,852
Forget it, let's go.
Let him crack.

168
00:16:19,938 --> 00:16:22,993
Tomorrow we see you.

169
00:16:23,079 --> 00:16:25,098
Apply it on, little girl.
- Tomorrow!

170
00:16:25,184 --> 00:16:28,340
Come on, man, we go.
We have the gun.

171
00:16:28,426 --> 00:16:31,189
If the thunder here.

172
00:16:32,677 --> 00:16:34,943
Wimp!

173
00:16:44,595 --> 00:16:47,026
Hey, Tao.

174
00:16:50,650 --> 00:16:53,020
How is it?

175
00:16:54,050 --> 00:16:56,632
How is it, Tao?

176
00:16:57,821 --> 00:17:00,165
What are you doing, little man?

177
00:17:00,252 --> 00:17:02,666
Why do women's work?

178
00:17:02,752 --> 00:17:04,767
What do you want?

179
00:17:04,852 --> 00:17:08,556
What? I can not just
with my little cousin to talk?

180
00:17:08,943 --> 00:17:12,062
He will not talk to you.

181
00:17:12,148 --> 00:17:14,438
I'm still here.
- Hey, Spider, who is that?

182
00:17:14,524 --> 00:17:16,166
How is it?
- Spider?

183
00:17:16,252 --> 00:17:18,940
Is that how you just said, Fong?

184
00:17:19,027 --> 00:17:23,149
Spider?
- Is there something wrong with Spider?

185
00:17:23,335 --> 00:17:25,135
What are you doing here?

186
00:17:25,221 --> 00:17:27,071
How old are you anyway?

187
00:17:27,157 --> 00:17:30,654
Mentally I'm much too old for you.
- What?

188
00:17:30,741 --> 00:17:33,188
You're a butthead.
I go inside.

189
00:17:33,274 --> 00:17:35,806
Well, Sue!

190
00:17:36,392 --> 00:17:39,007
Help your brother gardening.

191
00:17:39,094 --> 00:17:41,865
Still, blockhead.

192
00:17:42,551 --> 00:17:45,132
Hey, go with us a ride?

193
00:17:45,218 --> 00:17:46,598
Friend.

194
00:17:46,684 --> 00:17:49,063
Come on, go with us.
- Hang around a bit with us.

195
00:17:49,149 --> 00:17:52,196
You need someone to protect you.
That's great for cousins.

196
00:17:52,283 --> 00:17:55,032
Look, I've seen it all man.

197
00:17:55,117 --> 00:17:57,406
Previously everyone wanted to beat me.

198
00:17:57,492 --> 00:17:59,307
But now nobody is interfering
with me.

199
00:17:59,393 --> 00:18:02,011
Come on, let's go.
- We are cousins?

200
00:18:02,097 --> 00:18:04,409
Come on.
- We are cousins?

201
00:18:04,494 --> 00:18:05,972
We are family.

202
00:18:06,058 --> 00:18:10,377
A brother of Spider
is a brother of mine. Come on.

203
00:18:10,463 --> 00:18:13,498
Do those things.
- Come up, come on.

204
00:18:13,584 --> 00:18:17,805
This is women's work, man.
- Your hands are dirty, man.

205
00:18:20,939 --> 00:18:23,577
What should I do?

206
00:18:23,763 --> 00:18:27,890
Spider was on your neighbor.

207
00:18:29,176 --> 00:18:31,343
Talked about his car.

208
00:18:31,429 --> 00:18:33,744
Come on.

209
00:18:33,929 --> 00:18:39,191
Good.
- Yes, my little cousin is a small man.

210
00:18:46,850 --> 00:18:49,217
This is a nice car.

211
00:18:49,303 --> 00:18:53,650
1972 Gran Torino,
fastback.

212
00:18:53,735 --> 00:18:57,408
Cobra jet engine.
- Yes, that keeps him busy.

213
00:18:57,495 --> 00:19:02,386
He is perfect condition, man.

214
00:19:03,848 --> 00:19:05,161
I got one.

215
00:19:05,247 --> 00:19:08,794
There are a Mexican, a Jew
and a Negro in a bar.

216
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:13,364
The bartender looks up and says:
'Do you guys out of here!

217
00:19:14,370 --> 00:19:17,609
So here is my flock together
if they are not in the church.

218
00:19:17,695 --> 00:19:20,627
Hi, Pastor J.
- Hey, Mel. Hi, Darrel.

219
00:19:20,713 --> 00:19:23,574
Hello minister.
- Hi, Walt.

220
00:19:23,960 --> 00:19:27,520
What brings you here, Reverend.
The meat lottery?

221
00:19:28,206 --> 00:19:31,800
No, I came here to Walt
to talk, if that is good.

222
00:19:33,186 --> 00:19:37,296
Damn it, Reverend.
You are persistent or not.

223
00:19:37,383 --> 00:19:39,918
I have promised to your wife.

224
00:19:40,004 --> 00:19:43,227
Well, let's take a seat.

225
00:19:46,412 --> 00:19:50,408
I want a Pabst and a dash of Jack.
And what do you, Reverend?

226
00:19:50,494 --> 00:19:54,613
I want a Diet Coke.
- Nonsense, this is a bar. You must drink.

227
00:19:54,700 --> 00:19:58,966
I want a Gin and Tonic.
- Well done!

228
00:20:00,351 --> 00:20:03,618
What do you want?

229
00:20:03,703 --> 00:20:06,536
I promised your wife
I will make you confess.

230
00:20:06,622 --> 00:20:10,089
Why would you do that?
- She was so persevere.

231
00:20:10,176 --> 00:20:12,130
They did me.

232
00:20:12,216 --> 00:20:16,019
You can not promise things
you can not make it, Pastor?

233
00:20:16,104 --> 00:20:18,702
Let's talk about something else.
- What?

234
00:20:18,787 --> 00:20:20,877
Life and death.

235
00:20:20,963 --> 00:20:25,864
Life and death. What do you fucking
about life and death?

236
00:20:25,949 --> 00:20:27,768
I think I know a lot from it.

237
00:20:27,854 --> 00:20:29,830
I am a priest.

238
00:20:29,915 --> 00:20:32,662
Yes, you are preaching to
about life and death.

239
00:20:32,749 --> 00:20:35,605
But the only thing you know
is what you learned the priest training.

240
00:20:35,690 --> 00:20:38,805
Direct from the new Priest Manual.

241
00:20:38,891 --> 00:20:40,881
I know nothing of.

242
00:20:40,967 --> 00:20:42,809
This is bittersweet.

243
00:20:42,895 --> 00:20:47,189
Bitter in the pain
but fresh in his salvation.

244
00:20:47,274 --> 00:20:51,331
That's what you know about life and death,
and that is pathetic.

245
00:20:51,417 --> 00:20:53,729
What do you, Mr.. Kowalski?

246
00:20:53,815 --> 00:20:59,939
I know a lot. I lived
nearly three years in Korea. Thank you.

247
00:21:01,078 --> 00:21:02,252
We have men shot.

248
00:21:02,338 --> 00:21:08,771
We strike them with banjo networks,
we hakten seventeen-year-old's death in Spades.

249
00:21:09,442 --> 00:21:12,508
Things that I will remember my death.

250
00:21:12,594 --> 00:21:17,672
Terrible things,
things which I have to live.

251
00:21:17,903 --> 00:21:20,266
It's the life?

252
00:21:24,254 --> 00:21:26,219
Well, I ...

253
00:21:26,305 --> 00:21:28,952
I survived the war.

254
00:21:31,581 --> 00:21:34,168
I am married
and got a family.

255
00:21:35,302 --> 00:21:38,551
It sounds more
know about death than life.

256
00:21:45,092 --> 00:21:47,522
Perhaps, Pastor.

257
00:21:47,672 --> 00:21:49,828
Perhaps.

258
00:21:58,898 --> 00:22:01,765
Asshole.

259
00:22:55,529 --> 00:22:58,107
Hey, man, get in the car!
- Tao, get in!

260
00:22:58,192 --> 00:23:00,230
Come Tao.
- Come on. Let's go. Get in!

261
00:23:00,316 --> 00:23:02,742
Damn it, get in!

262
00:23:23,176 --> 00:23:24,381
Hello?

263
00:23:24,468 --> 00:23:27,018
Hey, good morning porridge.
This is your number one son, Mitch.

264
00:23:27,105 --> 00:23:30,864
Tomorrow? It is one hour in the afternoon.
It is not morning.

265
00:23:30,950 --> 00:23:34,715
Well, right.
Good then.

266
00:23:35,688 --> 00:23:39,172
What do you want?
- What?

267
00:23:39,669 --> 00:23:42,505
No, nothing.
I mean, what would I want?

268
00:23:42,591 --> 00:23:47,745
I do not know. Is your wife is already
off with your mother's jewelry?

269
00:23:48,738 --> 00:23:51,122
No, Dad, I just called
to hear how you are.

270
00:23:51,208 --> 00:23:54,250
Any news from the old neighborhood?

271
00:23:54,668 --> 00:23:59,119
Yes, no.
- Great, calm waters.

272
00:23:59,206 --> 00:24:02,250
Yes.
- Okay, okay then.

273
00:24:02,336 --> 00:24:05,613
Oh, hey, Dad.
- Yes.

274
00:24:05,699 --> 00:24:11,146
Do you happen to that guy from the factory
Lion who has season tickets?

275
00:24:15,260 --> 00:24:17,221
Dad?

276
00:24:48,036 --> 00:24:51,079
Are not they sweet?

277
00:25:06,515 --> 00:25:08,816
Come on.

278
00:25:23,549 --> 00:25:25,379
How is it?

279
00:25:25,465 --> 00:25:28,041
What are you doing, man?
- Nothing.

280
00:25:28,128 --> 00:25:32,262
Interfere with our own affairs.
- Just hanging around.

281
00:25:32,711 --> 00:25:34,795
What are you doing here?

282
00:25:35,951 --> 00:25:37,453
We are ready.

283
00:25:37,540 --> 00:25:40,580
I can not just
my little nephew to come?

284
00:25:44,861 --> 00:25:48,923
I have good news for you.
- Really? And that is?

285
00:25:49,010 --> 00:25:52,089
Only men talk.
- I do not think so.

286
00:25:52,175 --> 00:25:55,152
Why not?
- Come on, we give you another attempt.

287
00:25:55,238 --> 00:25:57,995
Do not go with you, Tao.
- Mind your own business, girl.

288
00:25:58,081 --> 00:26:00,703
Come on, go.
- Come on.

289
00:26:01,852 --> 00:26:04,025
Lift him.

290
00:26:32,191 --> 00:26:35,034
What is this?

291
00:26:36,718 --> 00:26:40,866
Get up.
- Get off my lawn.

292
00:26:42,787 --> 00:26:45,050
Listen old man.
You do not want to interfere with me.

293
00:26:45,135 --> 00:26:47,542
Did you not hear me?
Now go out of my lawn.

294
00:26:47,628 --> 00:26:49,756
Are you crazy?
Go back into the house.

295
00:26:49,842 --> 00:26:53,554
Yes, I blow a hole in your face
and then I go into the house.

296
00:26:53,641 --> 00:26:56,544
And I sleep like a baby.
You can count on it.

297
00:26:56,630 --> 00:27:00,408
We stacked ball things as you
two and a half meters high

298
00:27:00,494 --> 00:27:03,439
and if you use sand bags.

299
00:27:06,491 --> 00:27:08,583
Ok.

300
00:27:09,284 --> 00:27:13,127
You can now continue to look back better.

301
00:27:25,307 --> 00:27:27,327
Thank you.

302
00:27:28,288 --> 00:27:31,046
Get off my lawn.

303
00:28:04,533 --> 00:28:07,205
What is this?

304
00:28:17,583 --> 00:28:23,588
No, no.
No, no, come on. Not more.

305
00:28:25,797 --> 00:28:28,765
Stay there.

306
00:28:28,850 --> 00:28:30,522
Why can you
me alone?

307
00:28:30,608 --> 00:28:32,314
We have a couple of shallots
purchased for your garden.

308
00:28:32,400 --> 00:28:33,955
I want them.
- They are permanent plants.

309
00:28:34,040 --> 00:28:37,597
They grow every year.
- Why you bring me all this waste?

310
00:28:37,683 --> 00:28:39,751
Because ...

311
00:28:40,067 --> 00:28:41,910
Because you have saved Tao.

312
00:28:41,996 --> 00:28:46,608
I have saved no one. I have only a few
kwebbel income gap chased eyes of lawn.

313
00:28:46,693 --> 00:28:48,950
You are the hero of the neighborhood.
- I'm not a hero.

314
00:28:49,036 --> 00:28:51,854
Unfortunately you are.
So get the gifts.

315
00:28:51,941 --> 00:28:53,608
Please, take them.
- They are wrong.

316
00:28:53,694 --> 00:28:57,798
I want to be left alone, thank you.
- Wait!

317
00:29:00,234 --> 00:29:03,612
This is my mother, Vu.
I'm Sue, and that is my brother, Tao.

318
00:29:03,697 --> 00:29:06,289
We live next to you.
- And then?

319
00:29:06,374 --> 00:29:09,719
Tao wants to say something.

320
00:29:11,120 --> 00:29:14,875
Excuse me.
- Regret what?

321
00:29:14,960 --> 00:29:17,356
The attempted
to steal your car.

322
00:29:19,203 --> 00:29:21,416
Let me tell you one thing, boy.

323
00:29:21,502 --> 00:29:25,729
Put another step in this area,
and you're dead.

324
00:29:48,192 --> 00:29:50,514
Good afternoon, Walt.

325
00:29:50,881 --> 00:29:55,378
I said you do not go I confess.
- Why did not you just call the police?

326
00:29:55,464 --> 00:29:57,397
What?

327
00:29:57,483 --> 00:30:01,588
I'm working with a number of Hmong members,
and heard that there were problems in the neighborhood.

328
00:30:01,674 --> 00:30:04,509
Why did you not call the police?

329
00:30:05,020 --> 00:30:06,939
Well ...

330
00:30:08,199 --> 00:30:13,070
You know, I have prayed
that they would come, but ...

331
00:30:13,156 --> 00:30:16,503
nobody answered.
- What do you mean?

332
00:30:16,588 --> 00:30:20,293
There was someone to be slain.
We are talking about life or death. "

333
00:30:20,379 --> 00:30:23,783
If things are likely to go wrong,
you must respond quickly.

334
00:30:23,869 --> 00:30:28,294
When we were in Korea, and up to 1000
screaming crack eyes were on our side

335
00:30:28,380 --> 00:30:33,123
we do not call the police, we responded.
- We are not here in Korea, Mr.. Kowalski.

336
00:30:34,262 --> 00:30:37,520
I thought
about our conversation about life and death.

337
00:30:37,606 --> 00:30:39,424
About what you said.

338
00:30:39,509 --> 00:30:43,337
About how all the terrible things
which was forced meedraagt you.

339
00:30:43,423 --> 00:30:45,863
Terrible things that you do not let go.

340
00:30:46,099 --> 00:30:51,401
It seems that you are well
to eliminate some of that guilt feelings to let go.

341
00:30:51,542 --> 00:30:54,394
The things you do in the war
are terrible.

342
00:30:54,517 --> 00:30:56,517
The order to kill ...

343
00:30:56,603 --> 00:30:59,541
kill yourself to save
killing to save others.

344
00:30:59,628 --> 00:31:03,808
You're right.
These are things that I do not know.

345
00:31:04,292 --> 00:31:06,623
But I know of forgiveness.

346
00:31:06,709 --> 00:31:14,559
And I have a lot of men their sins and guilt
see and admit their burden left behind.

347
00:31:14,646 --> 00:31:16,979
Stronger men like you

348
00:31:17,216 --> 00:31:20,157
Men during the war that orders
got a bad things to implement.

349
00:31:20,243 --> 00:31:22,991
And now in peace.

350
00:31:23,179 --> 00:31:28,497
I must admit, Pastor,
you had time enough to say.

351
00:31:28,583 --> 00:31:32,188
Thank you
- And you had some things right.

352
00:31:32,274 --> 00:31:36,234
About men stronger than me,
who have found salvation.

353
00:31:36,321 --> 00:31:39,355
Damn, Hallelujah.

354
00:31:39,441 --> 00:31:44,800
But something else did you wrong.
- And what's that, Mr.. Kowalski?

355
00:31:44,886 --> 00:31:50,799
The thing that a man most opjaagt,
is that what he was not assigned to do.

356
00:31:55,378 --> 00:31:59,023
Look, you look back at last
as a normal person off.

357
00:31:59,108 --> 00:32:02,950
You should not wait until between
the haircuts, cheap bastard.

358
00:32:03,037 --> 00:32:05,254
I am surprised
you still are.

359
00:32:05,340 --> 00:32:09,636
I always hoped that you would die, and that
someone in your place who knew what he was doing.

360
00:32:09,722 --> 00:32:13,403
Instead, you keep hanging around here
as a Do-Wop, Dago, who you are.

361
00:32:13,488 --> 00:32:17,747
That is ten dollars, Walt.
- Ten dollars, Jesus Christ, Martin.

362
00:32:17,833 --> 00:32:21,080
Are you a half-Jew, or something?
You always increase the price.

363
00:32:21,166 --> 00:32:25,512
It has been five years, ten dollars, you know
as well as I do, Polish bastard.

364
00:32:25,599 --> 00:32:29,905
Keep the change.
- See you again in three weeks, dick.

365
00:32:30,080 --> 00:32:33,410
Not if I see before you, bitch.

366
00:32:41,783 --> 00:32:43,701
That's cool, you know.

367
00:32:50,038 --> 00:32:53,155
Man, check this out.
Look.

368
00:32:55,581 --> 00:32:59,105
Come here with that tight ass.
Come here, girl. Let me see.

369
00:32:59,192 --> 00:33:03,037
Can not you say hello?
You 're cocky.

370
00:33:04,683 --> 00:33:08,856
What is this, man?
- This is cool, Dog.

371
00:33:09,573 --> 00:33:11,761
What the hell are you doing in my neighborhood, man?

372
00:33:11,846 --> 00:33:17,034
Nothing, we went to the corner, away,
some CDs and so on, it's cool, bro.

373
00:33:17,120 --> 00:33:20,702
He called you bro, man.
- What? It's cool, bro.

374
00:33:20,787 --> 00:33:22,619
Sounds good.
- Shut up.

375
00:33:22,705 --> 00:33:25,580
Call me again bro
and I bite into your face.

376
00:33:25,666 --> 00:33:29,595
Yes, you bastard.
- Why are you here?

377
00:33:29,682 --> 00:33:33,882
Are you here to me
nice gift to bring?

378
00:33:33,968 --> 00:33:37,889
This Oriental Yummy?
- Do not worry, I really care for her.

379
00:33:37,975 --> 00:33:41,233
Get out here, man.
- Get out here, man.

380
00:33:43,728 --> 00:33:46,207
Hey, kid.
We told you.

381
00:33:46,294 --> 00:33:48,253
I told you that my friend
for her will.

382
00:33:48,339 --> 00:33:50,553
You stay here.
- So, now it is up to me.

383
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:51,837
Oh, great.

384
00:33:51,924 --> 00:33:56,361
Another asshole with an obsession for
Asian girls, which is already so old.

385
00:33:56,447 --> 00:33:58,622
What is your name, girl?

386
00:33:58,708 --> 00:34:00,237
My name?

387
00:34:00,323 --> 00:34:02,104
Get out here, okay.

388
00:34:02,190 --> 00:34:06,742
That is: 'Rags excessive, clearly come prepared
on every woman who passes and full stop. "

389
00:34:06,829 --> 00:34:08,916
That is my name.

390
00:34:10,702 --> 00:34:12,352
Who do you think
you're talking to?

391
00:34:12,439 --> 00:34:16,403
To whom it seems.
- You find yourself very nice, right?

392
00:34:16,988 --> 00:34:19,022
What she is tough.
- What? Please save me now?

393
00:34:19,108 --> 00:34:21,219
That would complete the picture.

394
00:34:21,305 --> 00:34:25,746
You must girl better defender.
Make a chain to the whore and pull out.

395
00:34:25,833 --> 00:34:28,428
Of course, just a stereotype dictionary.
- Oh, yes.

396
00:34:28,514 --> 00:34:32,310
Call me a bitch and whore in the same sentence.
- That bitch is crazy.

397
00:34:32,395 --> 00:34:35,683
So I like them.
- Get that bitch.

398
00:34:40,223 --> 00:34:44,238
You do not know when to stop you, girl.
- We will teach you a lesson.

399
00:34:44,323 --> 00:34:46,974
Stop, let go.

400
00:34:49,487 --> 00:34:51,627
Go there.

401
00:34:55,788 --> 00:34:58,511
What are you, old man?

402
00:34:58,862 --> 00:35:01,285
Where are you niggers doing?

403
00:35:01,372 --> 00:35:02,753
Negroes?

404
00:35:02,839 --> 00:35:05,980
You better make the right time,
now that still can.

405
00:35:06,066 --> 00:35:08,395
That's right, that you can do much better.

406
00:35:08,482 --> 00:35:11,130
Who do you think you are?

407
00:35:20,846 --> 00:35:23,999
Never noticed that you occasionally
someone, it will

408
00:35:24,086 --> 00:35:27,472
where you do not have to balls?

409
00:35:30,192 --> 00:35:32,352
That I am.

410
00:35:32,957 --> 00:35:35,200
Are you crazy man, on Thursday.

411
00:35:35,285 --> 00:35:39,728
Get out before I
you kick your white ass.

412
00:35:41,775 --> 00:35:44,698
He is really a bitch, man.

413
00:35:49,224 --> 00:35:54,314
Is the bastard completely crazy?
- Damn. What?

414
00:35:54,655 --> 00:35:57,301
Jump in the truck.

415
00:35:58,901 --> 00:36:04,184
He is a real asshole.
- He really used his finger.

416
00:36:04,345 --> 00:36:09,270
Hey, Dad easy.
- Keep your goddamn face.

417
00:36:10,327 --> 00:36:12,971
You do not want to listen, do you?

418
00:36:13,056 --> 00:36:16,731
And now in the truck.
- Get in the truck.

419
00:36:16,818 --> 00:36:20,963
Well done, old man.
- Shut up, wimp.

420
00:36:21,259 --> 00:36:24,396
What does all that stuff bro?

421
00:36:24,733 --> 00:36:26,679
Would you like Superman, or something?

422
00:36:26,766 --> 00:36:29,078
Those guys want to bro you are not
and I give them no wrong.

423
00:36:29,163 --> 00:36:32,807
Make that you are away.

424
00:36:38,508 --> 00:36:40,966
Take care of yourselves.

425
00:36:43,325 --> 00:36:45,460
You too.

426
00:36:48,333 --> 00:36:50,911
Oh, yes.

427
00:37:00,523 --> 00:37:02,847
Damn, we were
nothing done, man?

428
00:37:02,932 --> 00:37:04,347
We had him on his Thursday
to give.

429
00:37:04,433 --> 00:37:07,905
Damn.
- It is not worth it, man.

430
00:37:07,990 --> 00:37:11,448
He had the gun on your focus.
You could do nothing, man.

431
00:37:11,729 --> 00:37:14,596
What's in Godnaam
the matter with you?

432
00:37:15,215 --> 00:37:17,709
Are you trying to kill yourself?

433
00:37:17,796 --> 00:37:20,564
I thought Asian girls
or were smarter.

434
00:37:20,651 --> 00:37:24,280
To get to hang around in that area,
is a quick way for you to end.

435
00:37:24,366 --> 00:37:27,066
I know.
I know, calm down.

436
00:37:27,152 --> 00:37:29,890
And how about that fool
where you were together?

437
00:37:29,976 --> 00:37:32,452
Is that your boyfriend or something?

438
00:37:32,780 --> 00:37:38,046
Yeah, kind of, he is called Trey.
- Well, you should not deal with him.

439
00:37:38,132 --> 00:37:42,371
You should treat your own people.
- In other Hu-Momgs, you mean Hmong.

440
00:37:42,457 --> 00:37:47,340
Hmong, non-Hu Mmong
- I guess.

441
00:37:47,858 --> 00:37:52,222
Where is Hmong, Mong I mean then?

442
00:37:53,175 --> 00:37:56,221
You're the teachers, did you know that?

443
00:37:56,308 --> 00:37:59,078
No, no place is Hmong,
its people.

444
00:37:59,165 --> 00:38:03,509
Hmong people come from different
parts of Laos and Thailand and China.

445
00:38:03,601 --> 00:38:08,030
How did you come in my neighborhood?
Why have you not been there?

446
00:38:08,211 --> 00:38:09,786
It is a little Vietnamese.

447
00:38:09,872 --> 00:38:12,814
We have fought on your side.
And when the Americans stopped them ...

448
00:38:12,900 --> 00:38:15,169
started the Communists
all the Hmong to murder.

449
00:38:15,255 --> 00:38:17,202
So we came here.

450
00:38:17,289 --> 00:38:24,044
Yes. But why did you pick Midwest.
Snow on the ground, six months per year.

451
00:38:24,130 --> 00:38:27,451
What is it? Jungle people want
on the frozen tundra?

452
00:38:27,537 --> 00:38:33,044
Mountain People. We are people from the mountains,
no jungle people. Boo-ga, ga-Boo, Boo-ga!

453
00:38:33,129 --> 00:38:35,728
Yes, it will be.

454
00:38:35,814 --> 00:38:38,182
Enter the Lutheran debt.
they have brought to us below.

455
00:38:38,268 --> 00:38:41,952
All the Lutheran debt.

456
00:38:42,038 --> 00:38:47,364
Well, you would think that the cold
all these idiots would be absent.

457
00:38:48,446 --> 00:38:50,556
Thanks for the ride.

458
00:38:50,643 --> 00:38:53,597
You know, girl, you're quite right.

459
00:38:53,683 --> 00:38:58,094
But what happened to that damn brother of yours?
Is this a little slow, or something?

460
00:38:58,180 --> 00:39:04,366
Tao is actually pretty smart.
He not only knows what direction he should.

461
00:39:04,811 --> 00:39:07,775
Poor Toad.
- It is really common.

462
00:39:07,861 --> 00:39:09,808
Mhong girls adapt better.

463
00:39:09,895 --> 00:39:13,512
The girls go to school
and the boys to prison.

464
00:39:27,316 --> 00:39:30,779
The old witch hate me.

465
00:39:39,775 --> 00:39:43,187
Your birthday today, Daisy.

466
00:39:43,273 --> 00:39:47,496
This year you must make a choice
between two life paths.

467
00:39:47,582 --> 00:39:49,670
A second chance is on your way.

468
00:39:49,756 --> 00:39:54,864
Extraordinary events reach their
climax, which turns out to be anti-climax.

469
00:39:54,950 --> 00:40:03,546
Your lucky numbers are: 84, 23, 11, 78 and 99.

470
00:40:04,205 --> 00:40:07,115
What a nonsense.

471
00:40:08,676 --> 00:40:10,572
Yes.

472
00:40:24,564 --> 00:40:27,828
What is it these days
with children on?

473
00:40:29,503 --> 00:40:31,379
Well.

474
00:40:31,465 --> 00:40:36,475
Let me help you on it.
- Oh, thank you.

475
00:40:39,417 --> 00:40:41,571
How about that?

476
00:40:41,947 --> 00:40:44,621
How about it, Daisy?

477
00:40:55,193 --> 00:40:58,638
It is too heavy for me to wear.
- No problem.

478
00:41:07,746 --> 00:41:11,890
Karen Come, give it to him.
- Please.

479
00:41:13,272 --> 00:41:16,996
Well, what is it?
- It is a Gopher.

480
00:41:17,081 --> 00:41:20,879
So you can grasp things.
It makes things much easier.

481
00:41:21,561 --> 00:41:23,947
This is mine.

482
00:41:24,032 --> 00:41:26,869
It is a phone.

483
00:41:27,584 --> 00:41:29,430
I see that.

484
00:41:29,516 --> 00:41:33,710
I thought, well, we thought
that would make things easier.

485
00:41:33,796 --> 00:41:34,988
Thank you, Karen.

486
00:41:35,074 --> 00:41:38,021
There is nothing wrong with things
for yourself less difficult.

487
00:41:38,108 --> 00:41:40,614
Karen, is right, Dad.
You've worked hard all your life.

488
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:45,390
Maybe it's time to think about it
to facilitate.

489
00:41:46,595 --> 00:41:50,758
Another thing, Dad. You would really
cancer sticks that have been damaged.

490
00:41:51,107 --> 00:41:53,638
But, we think about the house.

491
00:41:53,724 --> 00:41:57,358
Now Mom is no longer here
There is much to maintain.

492
00:41:57,444 --> 00:42:01,951
Keep everything clean.
And now here you are ...

493
00:42:02,037 --> 00:42:06,117
Yes, there are great places.
Of those communities,

494
00:42:06,203 --> 00:42:09,513
where you do not have to worry
about your lawn mowing or snow slide.

495
00:42:09,599 --> 00:42:14,630
Where people like you, active and alert,
but only ...

496
00:42:14,716 --> 00:42:18,248
and support of people
of the same age.

497
00:42:18,335 --> 00:42:21,731
Yes, Dad, look. You should check here.
We have brought a few brochures.

498
00:42:21,816 --> 00:42:26,343
These places are not like you think that they are.
- No, they are beautiful.

499
00:42:26,429 --> 00:42:29,430
They are really beautiful.
They are real.

500
00:42:29,516 --> 00:42:31,972
These are top boundaries.

501
00:42:32,058 --> 00:42:35,406
It is almost like a hotel.
- They are beautiful.

502
00:42:35,491 --> 00:42:36,642
They are real.
- Yes.

503
00:42:36,728 --> 00:42:40,368
They take care of everything.
They are clean. They are really beautiful.

504
00:42:40,455 --> 00:42:43,165
They have beautiful stores.
You can buy new shoes.

505
00:42:43,250 --> 00:42:44,481
They are amazing,
they are real.

506
00:42:44,568 --> 00:42:48,646
You have a nice time.
Maybe a little play.

507
00:42:48,732 --> 00:42:51,047
Meet other people.

508
00:42:52,368 --> 00:42:55,608
Fuck us out kicking his birthday.
I told you this was a bad idea.

509
00:42:55,695 --> 00:42:58,418
I know. You were right.
- He leaves no one to help him.

510
00:42:58,504 --> 00:43:00,340
Well, we have tried.
Can we just let the rest?

511
00:43:00,426 --> 00:43:02,217
No one can say
that we have not tried.

512
00:43:02,303 --> 00:43:04,845
Let him run the pump.
You know what we should do?

513
00:43:04,930 --> 00:43:06,876
We were at home with Josh and Ashley
should continue.

514
00:43:06,962 --> 00:43:12,333
They were smart enough not to come.
These kids have more sense than we do.

515
00:43:13,469 --> 00:43:16,595
We miss Mom or not, Daisy?

516
00:43:35,946 --> 00:43:39,566
Hi, Walt.
What are you doing?

517
00:43:41,116 --> 00:43:43,645
We have a barbecue.
Wil you come?

518
00:43:43,731 --> 00:43:47,476
What do you think?
- We have tons of food.

519
00:43:47,561 --> 00:43:53,382
Yes, keep your hands off my dog.
- Do not worry. We only eat cats.

520
00:43:53,468 --> 00:43:56,254
Really?
- No, I'm kidding, moron.

521
00:43:56,341 --> 00:44:01,032
Come on, then you are my special guest.
- No, I did it myself.

522
00:44:01,830 --> 00:44:03,717
Yes ...

523
00:44:04,937 --> 00:44:10,423
Asshole.
- Okay, what have you eaten today?

524
00:44:10,826 --> 00:44:15,471
A piece of cake.
And a piece of dried beef.

525
00:44:15,557 --> 00:44:19,970
Come and get something to eat.
We have beer.

526
00:44:21,591 --> 00:44:23,308
Well ...

527
00:44:23,395 --> 00:44:30,351
I might as well drink with a stranger
than just drinking. It is my birthday.

528
00:44:30,436 --> 00:44:35,478
Really? Congratulations, Wally.
- Call me 'Wally'.

529
00:44:42,139 --> 00:44:48,935
You do not have enough beer Pabts
- As they say: 'when Mhong. "

530
00:44:49,516 --> 00:44:53,889
What am I doing wrong? Every time I
someone to look, they look at the floor.

531
00:45:00,222 --> 00:45:02,516
What she says?
- Welcome to our house.

532
00:45:02,603 --> 00:45:05,754
No, she says not.
- Yes, she says not.

533
00:45:06,059 --> 00:45:09,354
She hates me.
- Yes, they hate you.

534
00:45:09,556 --> 00:45:11,430
Ok.

535
00:45:18,081 --> 00:45:21,989
Where you see fish heads
also at?

536
00:45:22,076 --> 00:45:26,817
I think we
to the other room. Sorry.

537
00:45:31,142 --> 00:45:32,958
Many people in the room are traditional.

538
00:45:33,044 --> 00:45:35,943
Number 1, never touch a Hmong person
on his head on.

539
00:45:36,029 --> 00:45:40,305
Do not kid. Mhong people
believe that their soul to the head.

540
00:45:40,390 --> 00:45:43,994
Do not that.
- Sounds silly, but good.

541
00:45:44,081 --> 00:45:48,859
Yes, many people find it Mhong
in the eyes look very rude.

542
00:45:48,945 --> 00:45:52,741
So they look away when you look at them.
- Anything else?

543
00:45:52,827 --> 00:45:58,109
Yes, some people laugh Mhong
and grin as they scream.

544
00:45:58,196 --> 00:46:00,357
It is a cultural thing.

545
00:46:00,442 --> 00:46:05,636
The press embarrassment or uncertainty.
It is not that you laugh, or something.

546
00:46:05,722 --> 00:46:08,282
You people are mesjokke.

547
00:46:10,415 --> 00:46:12,433
But the food ...

548
00:46:12,520 --> 00:46:17,595
Looks good, smells good.
- Of course, it's Mhong eat.

549
00:46:17,782 --> 00:46:21,480
Okay, I can brag half time?

550
00:46:30,476 --> 00:46:32,941
Please.
- Thanks. You said ...

551
00:46:33,028 --> 00:46:36,497
they are not for people watching,
but he tail me all night.

552
00:46:36,583 --> 00:46:39,429
That is Kor Khue.
He is a family medicine Lor.

553
00:46:39,515 --> 00:46:42,885
What's that, a doctor or other magic?
- If something.

554
00:46:42,970 --> 00:46:47,368
Yes, boeki books.
- Very funny, Wally.

555
00:47:02,273 --> 00:47:04,886
Kor Khue is interested in you
He has heard what you've done.

556
00:47:04,971 --> 00:47:06,289
He likes you want to predict.

557
00:47:06,375 --> 00:47:10,076
It is rude to him not to do.
It is a great honor.

558
00:47:10,270 --> 00:47:14,922
Yes, of course, I think the best.
- Well, sit down,

559
00:47:31,909 --> 00:47:36,254
He says you do not respect our people.
They want you do not even look at.

560
00:47:42,223 --> 00:47:46,898
He says, as you live, your food has no taste.
You make you worry about your life.

561
00:47:55,473 --> 00:48:00,559
You have in your previous life is a mistake.
Are you not happy about?

562
00:48:06,539 --> 00:48:12,365
He says you do not have joy in your life.
It is as if you have no peace.

563
00:48:37,209 --> 00:48:39,415
Goes well with you?

564
00:48:40,077 --> 00:48:43,531
Yes, it is good to me.

565
00:48:43,617 --> 00:48:47,020
It goes well with me.

566
00:49:07,421 --> 00:49:13,007
I have more in common with this slit eyes
rotten with my own family.

567
00:49:13,093 --> 00:49:15,744
Jesus Christ.

568
00:49:18,009 --> 00:49:20,625
Congratulations on your birthday.

569
00:49:21,797 --> 00:49:25,970
All right with you?
- Yes, I'm fine.

570
00:49:26,499 --> 00:49:30,350
You bleed.
- I have bitten my tongue.

571
00:49:30,436 --> 00:49:31,558
It is nothing.

572
00:49:31,643 --> 00:49:36,122
Let's go down and slit-eyes
food to eat. I die of hunger.

573
00:49:36,209 --> 00:49:38,196
Well.

574
00:49:44,450 --> 00:49:46,911
It is beautiful.

575
00:49:46,997 --> 00:49:49,561
This stuff is really good.

576
00:49:57,465 --> 00:50:00,079
Come on, wolverine.
- What is it?

577
00:50:00,166 --> 00:50:02,667
Let's go.
- Why?

578
00:50:02,753 --> 00:50:06,901
To us the people to mix.
- I mix me all right.

579
00:50:06,986 --> 00:50:10,458
Come on. You've told me
you not only to them.

580
00:50:13,532 --> 00:50:17,145
Thank you very much.
I must go now.

581
00:50:18,558 --> 00:50:22,497
I'll be back.
Let it not interfere road.

582
00:50:32,741 --> 00:50:37,558
Well, look who it is.
- Yes, that guy who wanted to steal my Torino.

583
00:50:37,645 --> 00:50:42,710
My brother Tao.
- He tried. He has learned.

584
00:51:12,874 --> 00:51:17,143
He was a bit wobbly.
I have made.

585
00:51:46,801 --> 00:51:48,004
What is this?

586
00:51:48,090 --> 00:51:51,066
A bit of rice alcoholic drink.
Here, try it.

587
00:51:51,152 --> 00:51:53,163
Well.

588
00:52:16,560 --> 00:52:19,232
My friends and I asked ourselves
here is what you do.

589
00:52:19,319 --> 00:52:22,879
That's a good question,
what I do.

590
00:52:23,311 --> 00:52:26,384
My name is Walt.
- Hi, Walt. I am Wa Xam.

591
00:52:26,469 --> 00:52:30,395
Wa Yum?
- No, Wa Xam.

592
00:52:30,575 --> 00:52:35,601
Wa Xam, good.
- What are you doing?

593
00:52:35,690 --> 00:52:38,771
I fix things. Things like that.
- Like what?

594
00:52:38,856 --> 00:52:42,072
I have just repaired the dryer.

595
00:52:42,158 --> 00:52:45,279
I have just the sink
my friend repaired.

596
00:52:45,364 --> 00:52:50,406
I drove my great-aunt to doctor
recipes for her to explain.

597
00:52:50,493 --> 00:52:54,240
I have the door repaired
that piece was not even.

598
00:52:54,326 --> 00:52:56,072
You're funny.

599
00:52:56,158 --> 00:52:59,441
I am mentioned frequently but never funny.

600
00:52:59,582 --> 00:53:05,014
Well, I go by. Have fun.
- Okay, Yum Yum. It was a pleasure.

601
00:53:08,777 --> 00:53:11,468
She goes. Come on.

602
00:53:15,476 --> 00:53:19,784
Relax, empty head.
I 'm not gonna shoot.

603
00:53:20,361 --> 00:53:23,522
I would look down on her,
if I were you.

604
00:53:23,609 --> 00:53:26,089
I know you a little sucker was
when I first saw you.

605
00:53:26,175 --> 00:53:32,422
Never thought that you were even worse
women than to steal from cars, Toad.

606
00:53:33,123 --> 00:53:36,081
It is Tao.
- What?

607
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:39,130
It is not Toad, it's Tao.
My name is Tao.

608
00:53:39,216 --> 00:53:41,606
Yes, you verknalde while the
the girl was there.

609
00:53:41,692 --> 00:53:44,848
Not that I do anything
a Toad as you.

610
00:53:44,935 --> 00:53:46,628
You do not know where you are talking about.

611
00:53:46,714 --> 00:53:49,982
You have the wrong spring rolls.
I know exactly what I am talking about.

612
00:53:50,068 --> 00:53:52,375
I am perhaps the most enjoyable
persoontje to deal

613
00:53:52,461 --> 00:53:56,020
but I had the best woman
on this planet, who married.

614
00:53:56,106 --> 00:53:59,197
I was sure it was the best
what ever happened to me. It.

615
00:53:59,282 --> 00:54:00,573
But you ...

616
00:54:00,658 --> 00:54:05,963
You let Ding Dong Click Clack and Charlie Chan
Miss with 'what-is-its-face' walk away.

617
00:54:06,049 --> 00:54:09,672
They like you, you know.
No idea why.

618
00:54:09,967 --> 00:54:12,132
Who?

619
00:54:12,662 --> 00:54:14,321
Yum Yum!

620
00:54:14,408 --> 00:54:19,852
You know, that girl in the purple sweater.
They looked at you all day, chucklehead.

621
00:54:20,976 --> 00:54:24,807
You mean, Wa Xam?
- Yes, Yum Yum. Yes, nice girl.

622
00:54:24,893 --> 00:54:28,682
Nice girl. A very charming girl.
I have spoken with her.

623
00:54:28,768 --> 00:54:32,283
But you, you let her go
with three slaves.

624
00:54:32,369 --> 00:54:35,720
And you know why?
Because you're a big fat wimp.

625
00:54:37,483 --> 00:54:39,581
Well ...

626
00:54:39,735 --> 00:54:44,912
I gotta go.
Fine day, soft cake.

627
00:54:58,078 --> 00:55:00,725
No, not more.

628
00:55:03,055 --> 00:55:05,753
Okay, put them down.

629
00:55:19,980 --> 00:55:23,809
No, no. no more.
Not anymore. Come on.

630
00:55:25,779 --> 00:55:28,360
No more, please.
I ...

631
00:55:29,148 --> 00:55:32,111
Is that kipknoedel
the last time you had?

632
00:55:32,196 --> 00:55:34,207
Okay.

633
00:55:39,749 --> 00:55:42,964
Better than that worthless beef
I can tell you.

634
00:55:55,549 --> 00:55:57,706
What is wrong?

635
00:55:58,935 --> 00:56:01,309
What is wrong?
- Toa is here to put things right.

636
00:56:01,395 --> 00:56:04,392
He is here to work for you.
- That he is not.

637
00:56:04,478 --> 00:56:06,938
He does not work for me.

638
00:56:07,089 --> 00:56:10,900
My mother says that the family shame
has and must now repay his debt.

639
00:56:10,985 --> 00:56:13,657
He starts tomorrow morning.
- Oh, no. Not tomorrow. Never.

640
00:56:13,743 --> 00:56:17,818
I do not even want him on my land.
I thought that we had had.

641
00:56:18,942 --> 00:56:20,824
It is very important for my mother
that you accept.

642
00:56:20,910 --> 00:56:22,890
It would be an insult to
if you refuse.

643
00:56:22,976 --> 00:56:26,993
Why turn against me?
He tried to steal my car ...

644
00:56:27,079 --> 00:56:29,325
and suddenly I'm the bad.

645
00:56:29,411 --> 00:56:31,871
Look, my family is very traditional

646
00:56:31,957 --> 00:56:34,863
very disappointed and would be made
Tao if it does not repay.

647
00:56:34,949 --> 00:56:37,643
Sue, if he does not want to do,
let him go.

648
00:56:37,729 --> 00:56:41,075
Keep your mouth!

649
00:56:42,121 --> 00:56:44,812
Yes, you keep your mouth.

650
00:56:44,899 --> 00:56:50,486
Well, tomorrow.
Come on, tomorrow. Thank you.

651
00:56:50,916 --> 00:56:52,946
Thank you.

652
00:56:53,995 --> 00:56:59,341
Jesus, who Mhong Mokkels
just cops.

653
00:57:03,842 --> 00:57:07,300
The son of a bitch, I thought he
would not come up.

654
00:57:13,954 --> 00:57:16,808
Well, where are you in?

655
00:57:17,581 --> 00:57:21,818
Like what?
- That I ask you.

656
00:57:22,517 --> 00:57:24,992
If you work for me
I must know where you are good at.

657
00:57:25,078 --> 00:57:29,453
I need to know what you can.
- I do not know.

658
00:57:29,626 --> 00:57:33,638
That is about half of what I
expected that you would say.

659
00:57:33,827 --> 00:57:38,942
See that tree over there?
Go back and count the birds.

660
00:57:39,137 --> 00:57:42,903
Do you want me count the birds?
- Yes, you can still count?

661
00:57:42,988 --> 00:57:46,529
All you slit eyes
are still good at math, right?

662
00:57:46,751 --> 00:57:49,739
Yes, I can count.
- Good.

663
00:57:55,900 --> 00:57:59,021
One, two ...

664
00:58:02,769 --> 00:58:06,715
What do you have for me to do?
Wil you that I watch the paint dry?

665
00:58:06,801 --> 00:58:08,973
You may want to
I count the clouds that come?

666
00:58:09,058 --> 00:58:11,694
Do not be so brutal to me, boy.

667
00:58:12,077 --> 00:58:15,415
I'm not the one who tried to
to steal. Remember that.

668
00:58:17,233 --> 00:58:18,668
Go ahead.

669
00:58:18,754 --> 00:58:20,963
I don 't care if you insult me
or says racist things.

670
00:58:21,049 --> 00:58:24,979
Do you know what? I accept it.
- Of course you accept it.

671
00:58:25,065 --> 00:58:28,254
Because you have no teeth
and have no balls, kid.

672
00:58:29,870 --> 00:58:36,098
Look, I'm here to adopt. Why search
you do not something sensible for me to do.

673
00:58:36,424 --> 00:58:41,370
I am not like you. I am not useless
and I maintained my own property.

674
00:58:41,689 --> 00:58:45,932
You swamp rats
there may be nothing to do.

675
00:58:47,370 --> 00:58:50,212
How long do I have?

676
00:58:52,508 --> 00:58:55,511
Toad, how long?

677
00:58:55,597 --> 00:58:57,995
Until next week Friday.

678
00:59:01,097 --> 00:59:06,052
Well, get the ladder from the garage.

679
00:59:08,460 --> 00:59:13,645
When you're done with that roof,
you can gutter again carpenter.

680
00:59:13,731 --> 00:59:16,925
It bothers me for three years.

681
00:59:24,472 --> 00:59:27,035
Yes, what you say, comrade.

682
01:00:31,943 --> 01:00:33,467
Hello.

683
01:00:33,553 --> 01:00:35,270
Grandpa asked whether you can ensure

684
01:00:35,356 --> 01:00:41,967
Toa that the large hornets' nest
under our porch away.

685
01:00:42,054 --> 01:00:46,162
Hornets' nest?
That is terrible.

686
01:00:46,923 --> 01:00:49,926
I think that after the lunch
to regulate.

687
01:01:26,437 --> 01:01:29,245
Holy God, quit.

688
01:01:29,331 --> 01:01:33,598
Hey, it's my last day.
What do you have for me to do?

689
01:01:35,518 --> 01:01:39,111
Take today, Friday
You've done enough.

690
01:01:44,163 --> 01:01:46,080
Taod!

691
01:01:49,465 --> 01:01:52,337
Nothing.
Forget it.

692
01:02:17,424 --> 01:02:19,537
Kowski?

693
01:02:21,181 --> 01:02:23,354
Kowski?

694
01:02:24,318 --> 01:02:26,393
Kowski?

695
01:02:32,715 --> 01:02:35,561
Mr. Kowalski?
Good morning.

696
01:02:35,648 --> 01:02:40,992
I have viewed your paper and I think we
should immediately begin a series of tests.

697
01:02:41,077 --> 01:02:46,388
I feel that this is the best way to all
issues that you had to check.

698
01:02:46,474 --> 01:02:51,142
Excuse me, what happened to doctor Felmon,
my doctor, happened?

699
01:02:51,229 --> 01:02:56,462
Dr. Felmon retired three years ago.
I'm his replacement, Dr Chang.

700
01:03:04,009 --> 01:03:05,806
It is Grandpa Walt.
- Take on you.

701
01:03:05,892 --> 01:03:08,539
You talk to him!
Mitch.

702
01:03:08,912 --> 01:03:13,494
I am the accounts to do it.
- You talk to him. It's your father.

703
01:03:17,859 --> 01:03:19,146
Hi, Dad.

704
01:03:19,232 --> 01:03:23,597
<i> Hey, Mitch.
I am your father. </ I></i>

705
01:03:23,684 --> 01:03:25,932
<i> Yeah, I know.
What is going on </ i></i>

706
01:03:26,017 --> 01:03:28,971
Nothing, not much.

707
01:03:29,406 --> 01:03:30,785
How are you?

708
01:03:30,871 --> 01:03:33,536
Well, all right.

709
01:03:34,225 --> 01:03:39,685
<i> Good, and Karen and the kids </ i></i>

710
01:03:39,814 --> 01:03:43,560
Well, everybody does it.
They do well.

711
01:03:43,645 --> 01:03:47,082
Good. And the work?

712
01:03:47,169 --> 01:03:50,304
<i> Press. Yes ...</ i></i>

713
01:03:50,391 --> 01:03:52,760
Yes, I thought that al

714
01:03:52,846 --> 01:03:59,904
Dad, talk about pressure, I have
much to do, so if nothing is urgent ...

715
01:04:00,712 --> 01:04:04,832
No, nothing.

716
01:04:04,918 --> 01:04:06,641
Why call you the weekend?

717
01:04:06,727 --> 01:04:08,517
Sure.

718
01:04:08,604 --> 01:04:11,527
<i> Well, nice to have just spoken, Dad.
Thanks for calling. </ I></i>

719
01:04:11,613 --> 01:04:15,150
Thank you.

720
01:04:24,505 --> 01:04:26,588
HOSPITAL TOELATINGSFORMULIER

721
01:04:26,674 --> 01:04:30,917
MEDICAL TESTING RESULTS

722
01:04:59,230 --> 01:05:02,513
This guy has no chance.

723
01:05:16,756 --> 01:05:19,120
What do you know of cranes?

724
01:05:19,206 --> 01:05:21,897
I know everything there, boy.

725
01:05:22,166 --> 01:05:24,626
Go to the side.

726
01:05:24,713 --> 01:05:28,265
Jesus on earth.
- What?

727
01:05:28,351 --> 01:05:33,112
It should be here to 100 degrees.
Put the fan.

728
01:05:41,881 --> 01:05:44,882
Please, this dondert together.

729
01:05:48,390 --> 01:05:51,104
Man, where you have all this stuff come from?

730
01:05:51,190 --> 01:05:55,214
What are you talking about?
- About the tools and everything.

731
01:05:56,083 --> 01:05:59,483
Well, it will be for a thief
a surprise,

732
01:05:59,570 --> 01:06:02,957
but I have all these things here
bought with my own money.

733
01:06:03,044 --> 01:06:07,606
Yes, yes. That is not what I meant.
I mean, there's so much.

734
01:06:07,692 --> 01:06:13,708
Yes, each tool has a purpose.
Everything has a job to do.

735
01:06:13,794 --> 01:06:18,459
All that is required.
- Okay, what's that?

736
01:06:18,544 --> 01:06:20,889
That is paalgatgraver.
- And that?

737
01:06:20,974 --> 01:06:22,900
Hand Schep.

738
01:06:22,986 --> 01:06:26,220
You know it is a hand shovel, come on.

739
01:06:26,305 --> 01:06:28,385
This is a metal scissors,
and that is a saw.

740
01:06:28,471 --> 01:06:31,627
This is a hammer
You can 't be fooled, kid.

741
01:06:34,188 --> 01:06:36,846
Well, what are you like.

742
01:06:37,284 --> 01:06:41,171
It is just ...
I can imagine all this stuff not afford.

743
01:06:41,257 --> 01:06:45,182
Well, I think that even a dolt like you
will understand

744
01:06:45,268 --> 01:06:48,493
that somebody will get together
over a period of 50 years.

745
01:06:48,579 --> 01:06:53,168
Yes, but ...
- Well, look. Here.

746
01:06:53,725 --> 01:06:56,957
What you need is here.

747
01:06:57,043 --> 01:07:02,589
WD-40 and a pipe wrench
and ductape.

748
01:07:02,674 --> 01:07:08,268
Any man who is worth anything, the half
the chores at home with those three things.

749
01:07:08,354 --> 01:07:10,703
Everything else you need
you just borrow, that's all.

750
01:07:10,788 --> 01:07:13,878
Well. Cool.

751
01:07:22,747 --> 01:07:25,260
Fuck you.
- What is that?

752
01:07:25,346 --> 01:07:27,662
Nothing.
What?

753
01:07:27,748 --> 01:07:33,515
Nothing? I saw you expectorate blood.
That is not good. You have to go to a doctor.

754
01:07:37,219 --> 01:07:39,317
Look, ...

755
01:07:39,610 --> 01:07:42,989
Those boys who were here on that night ...

756
01:07:43,258 --> 01:07:48,028
on my lawn, how about with them?
- Just a mess. Hmong gang.

757
01:07:48,115 --> 01:07:50,825
Yes, I thought that al
What did they do here.

758
01:07:50,911 --> 01:07:57,116
She wanted me to take. They were angry
I had my first inauguration blow.

759
01:07:57,202 --> 01:08:03,340
Yes, you're a wimp if you
that kind of guests want to hang around.

760
01:08:03,426 --> 01:08:06,632
What did you inauguration should be.

761
01:08:15,449 --> 01:08:17,920
My Gran Torino?

762
01:08:45,919 --> 01:08:48,394
Toad, do you mind?

763
01:08:51,291 --> 01:08:53,149
Here he is.

764
01:08:53,236 --> 01:08:54,694
This is the deal.

765
01:08:54,780 --> 01:08:57,578
I take the top
because this is the worst. I pull out

766
01:08:57,664 --> 01:09:01,852
and you are there and pushes.
And each step up to help me push.

767
01:09:01,939 --> 01:09:03,715
Just that way.
- Let me take the top.

768
01:09:03,801 --> 01:09:05,426
No, I take the top.

769
01:09:05,512 --> 01:09:07,457
No, I take the top.
He seems pretty heavy.

770
01:09:07,544 --> 01:09:09,681
I'm not crippled.
I take the top.

771
01:09:09,766 --> 01:09:13,008
If you have the top does not take
I do not help and I go back home.

772
01:09:13,094 --> 01:09:15,568
Listen to me, zero.
- No, you listen, old man!

773
01:09:15,654 --> 01:09:17,786
I'm here because you need help.

774
01:09:17,872 --> 01:09:20,554
So it is the top
I'm outta here.

775
01:09:23,464 --> 01:09:28,973
Well, you take the top
and I push.

776
01:09:29,059 --> 01:09:34,278
Leave him out of your small
girl hands slip and crush me.

777
01:09:34,790 --> 01:09:37,601
Bring me ideas.

778
01:09:46,465 --> 01:09:49,331
That thing weighs a ton.

779
01:09:49,445 --> 01:09:53,303
But it runs like a clock.
If they do not anymore.

780
01:09:53,389 --> 01:09:59,335
What will you do with it?
- Selling, I think.

781
01:09:59,898 --> 01:10:03,859
How many?
- Sixty dollars.

782
01:10:03,946 --> 01:10:08,725
I'm sick of that in the basement
to leave.

783
01:10:08,811 --> 01:10:12,198
Why?
Are you looking for a freezer?

784
01:10:12,384 --> 01:10:17,417
Those of us play.
- Okay, twenty-five dollars and he is yours.

785
01:10:17,503 --> 01:10:19,831
Twenty-five?
But you just said sixties.

786
01:10:19,917 --> 01:10:22,979
I know, but it saves me money for a
ad in the newspaper to continue.

787
01:10:23,065 --> 01:10:26,579
Come on, let him
drag to your house.

788
01:10:31,540 --> 01:10:34,299
A bit ironic, huh?
- What?

789
01:10:34,385 --> 01:10:38,258
Toad a car wash
he tried to steal from you.

790
01:10:38,345 --> 01:10:42,151
Yes, if he misses a spot
then it all again.

791
01:10:42,238 --> 01:10:46,717
Nice as it provides you.
He is not really an example in his life.

792
01:10:46,803 --> 01:10:50,408
I am not an example.
- But you're a good man, Wally.

793
01:10:50,495 --> 01:10:54,084
I wanted you as our father had been.
- Give me no more Wally.

794
01:10:54,171 --> 01:10:57,927
No, I'm serious. He was really
hard against us, very traditional

795
01:10:58,013 --> 01:11:01,405
and really old-fashioned.
- I'm old-fashioned.

796
01:11:01,492 --> 01:11:05,235
Yes, but you're an American.

797
01:11:05,448 --> 01:11:07,765
What do you mean?

798
01:11:11,039 --> 01:11:13,610
You like him or not?
- Take me in your leg?

799
01:11:13,696 --> 01:11:16,015
He tried to steal my car.

800
01:11:16,101 --> 01:11:18,664
And time you bring with him,
teach him to fix things.

801
01:11:18,750 --> 01:11:22,907
And saved him from the fucking cousin of us ...
- Hey, watch your language, lady!

802
01:11:22,992 --> 01:11:27,667
And you're a good man.
- I am not a good man.

803
01:11:27,753 --> 01:11:31,868
Give me another beer, dragon lady.
It is empty.

804
01:11:38,095 --> 01:11:42,178
You know, Hmong believes
gardening is that women's work.

805
01:11:42,823 --> 01:11:46,850
Yes, that's why I see you always in the garden.

806
01:11:46,936 --> 01:11:51,258
Furthermore, we are not in Hu-Mong.
- Funny.

807
01:11:53,466 --> 01:11:55,741
You should stop.

808
01:11:55,828 --> 01:12:01,453
That is bad for you
- Yes? Like a gang go slow duikelaar.

809
01:12:01,652 --> 01:12:03,748
Did you not hear what I just said?

810
01:12:03,834 --> 01:12:08,344
I saw you expectorate blood.
You should stop.

811
01:12:10,492 --> 01:12:15,047
What does the fact that emblem?

812
01:12:15,541 --> 01:12:18,882
First cavalry.
I have since'51.

813
01:12:20,766 --> 01:12:23,969
What do you do with your life, son.

814
01:12:24,118 --> 01:12:29,876
I thought perhaps sell.
- Sale?

815
01:12:30,569 --> 01:12:34,110
My oldest son is in the sale.
- Is he right?

816
01:12:34,196 --> 01:12:37,890
Oh, yes.
License to steal.

817
01:12:37,976 --> 01:12:42,699
I have fifty years worked in the Ford plant,
and he sells Japanese cars.

818
01:12:42,785 --> 01:12:45,907
Have you built cars?
- Yes.

819
01:12:46,107 --> 01:12:53,117
I placed the steering column in the Gran Torino
in 1972, when he rolled the tape.

820
01:12:53,866 --> 01:12:56,721
You are old.
So cool.

821
01:12:56,808 --> 01:13:02,610
Yes, so you want in the sale. You think about it
perhaps to go to school?

822
01:13:02,696 --> 01:13:07,575
A little, but school costs money.
- Maybe you should take a job.

823
01:13:07,661 --> 01:13:12,605
You can not sit
manure and straw under my garden.

824
01:13:12,986 --> 01:13:16,677
Maybe you can pay me.
- Yes, very funny.

825
01:13:17,626 --> 01:13:23,820
What kind of job can I get?
- Yes, you're right. No one will you never take.

826
01:13:24,713 --> 01:13:27,682
Yes, I know.
- I kidding, zero.

827
01:13:27,767 --> 01:13:31,119
I mean, you get a job.
You get a job anywhere.

828
01:13:31,206 --> 01:13:32,561
Like what?

829
01:13:32,646 --> 01:13:34,981
What about the building?
- Me?

830
01:13:35,066 --> 01:13:36,743
Yes.
- The construction?

831
01:13:36,829 --> 01:13:38,590
Yes.
- Do you have Alzheimer's or something.

832
01:13:38,676 --> 01:13:42,990
No. You get a job in construction.
I know people in the box.

833
01:13:43,075 --> 01:13:47,373
Of course, I tell you what training
and a bit 'opmannen.

834
01:13:47,459 --> 01:13:49,642
Me "opmannen?
- Yes.

835
01:13:49,728 --> 01:13:53,890
And I think you Miss Yum Yum
must interrogate.

836
01:13:54,196 --> 01:13:56,570
It would do you good.

837
01:13:58,752 --> 01:13:59,468
It would

838
01:14:05,139 --> 01:14:08,019
Now how do you guys talk.

01:14:30,910 --> 01:14:33,127
Got a blind man
afgeholpen of money?

847
01:14:33,213 --> 01:14:35,754
Have you given him the wrong change?

01:14:35,841 --> 01:14:41,806
Oh, he's the wimp of the neighbors.

Come on and come in
and talk to him as a man.

852
01:14:52,830 --> 01:14:54,318
If a real man.

Come on.
Get to come out.

854
01:14:57,916 --> 01:15:00,688
Come back now.
I am sorry for that.

855
01:15:00,774 --> 01:15:02,615
It is good.

856
01:15:07,724 --> 01:15:10,268
How is it, you old Italian dick?

857
01:15:10,355 --> 01:15:14,190

01:15:17,733 --> 01:15:22,302
Take it easy. What the hell are you doing?
Are you crazy?

01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:25,037
That is what you said.

Something you do not, you will not

If you say the wrong
knalt than he spleetooghoofd you off.

863
01:15:34,536 --> 01:15:39,290
What was I supposed to say?
- To begin with: "Hi or 'hello'.

864
01:15:39,375 --> 01:15:43,051
Yes, come in and say: 'Sir, I would like

In fact, you can have a job in the construction

867
01:15:48,310 --> 01:15:51,266
Or tell your friend

and those bastards have caught me.
They screwed me in the ass.

01:15:57,478 --> 01:16:01,670
Yes, do not swear at the boy.
Talk about people who are not in the room.

871
01:16:01,756 --> 01:16:05,907
You can whine about your boss,
you work late as the bowling night.

872
01:16:05,993 --> 01:16:10,603
Right, if my wife zeurt

she starts to cry why we never talk.

01:16:17,702 --> 01:16:20,047
See, now go out.
Come back inside and talk to him.

876
01:16:20,133 --> 01:16:23,256
It is on earth,
not rocket science.

877
01:16:23,342 --> 01:16:28,354
Yes, but I have no job,
no car or a girlfriend.

878
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,383

Not so, yes, to me.
Just say: 'yes, sir, I do my best. "

888
01:17:39,951 --> 01:17:42,913
Yes, I do my best.

I do not want you put me in front.

01:17:46,710 --> 01:17:49,294
No, I do my best.
I go for it.

891
01:17:49,379 --> 01:17:50,591
Explain you can not accept that.

892
01:17:50,677 --> 01:17:55,721
Look him right in his eyes and the man
may know a lot about you by your handshake.

893
01:17:55,807 --> 01:17:59,631
Here, do this in your back pocket.

Sucks, but who is listening?

Help yourself, Walt.

01:18:25,944 --> 01:18:30,048
He knows about the building
and he is a smart kid.

902
01:18:30,134 --> 01:18:32,034
He does everything
which you need him.

903
01:18:32,119 --> 01:18:34,349

I see that Walt brought you here.
Do you have a vehicle?

01:18:43,320 --> 01:18:48,186
At this moment. I am now going by bus.

01:19:04,233 --> 01:19:09,840
Well, come Monday

Why would anyone my car?

What do we do?

923
01:20:02,687 --> 01:20:06,907
What do you do?
Your tools in a carry bag?

924
01:20:15,659 --> 01:20:18,858

01:20:19,259 --> 01:20:22,163
and you have a need.

926
01:20:22,990 --> 01:20:24,622

Cool.

This is what I was looking for.
Here, a tool belt.

01:20:39,040 --> 01:20:41,239
I have tools, but I leave you
not borrow my tool belt.

933
01:20:41,325 --> 01:20:43,977
You can deal with tools when you go.

934
01:20:44,224 --> 01:20:46,435
I really appreciate it.
- Forget it.

935
01:20:46,520 --> 01:20:49,817
No, I really do.
Thank you.

936
01:21:25,787 --> 01:21:27,680
How are you, comrade?

01:21:35,006 --> 01:21:37,913

943
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:48,891
What?

944
01:21:50,899 --> 01:21:52,069
You're scared, huh?

945
01:21:52,155 --> 01:21:54,493
Who did that stuff for you bought your father?
- What do you want from me?

946
01:21:54,579 --> 01:21:56,441
Did your father bought this stuff for you?
- Get your hands off my stuff.

947
01:21:56,527 --> 01:22:00,964
I need that helmet.
- Why you let me look so bad, huh?

948
01:22:01,280 --> 01:22:04,541

953
01:22:18,944 --> 01:22:21,650
What's the saying
I'm looking for?

954
01:22:21,735 --> 01:22:25,337
Oh, yes, red face. "

955
01:22:31,850 --> 01:22:33,662
Hi.

956
01:22:33,748 --> 01:22:36,550
Hi.
I am in a hurry.

957
01:22:36,636 --> 01:22:39,585
I have you all seen a few days.
Where have you been?

958
01:22:39,672 --> 01:22:41,778
I'm busy.

959
01:22:42,441 --> 01:22:44,419
Busy?

960
01:22:47,657 --> 01:22:50,734
What the hell happened to you?
- Don 't worry about it.

961
01:22:50,819 --> 01:22:53,514
What do you mean, 'do not worry. "
Look at your face.

962
01:22:53,599 --> 01:22:56,365
I said, 'do not worry. "
Okay, it's not your problem.

963
01:22:56,451 --> 01:22:58,346
When?

964
01:22:58,432 --> 01:23:02,162
It took me a couple days ago
when I just came from my work.

965
01:23:02,249 --> 01:23:03,989
Cowards.

966
01:23:04,075 --> 01:23:06,393
I did what I could do.

967
01:23:06,479 --> 01:23:09,310
But what they have
Your tools destroyed.

968
01:23:09,396 --> 01:23:13,647
I will be replaced.
- Do not worry for the tool.

969
01:23:16,649 --> 01:23:19,028
Where lives your cousin?

970
01:23:21,328 --> 01:23:24,718
No, Walt.
It is all right with me.

971
01:23:24,804 --> 01:23:28,930
I do not want you to do something.
- Good.

972
01:23:29,703 --> 01:23:34,507
If you need additional tools
let me know.

973
01:23:35,025 --> 01:23:42,210
Well, I can use a roofing hammer.
- Well, go to my garage and get it.

974
01:24:16,817 --> 01:24:19,631
That would be the last.

975
01:24:44,713 --> 01:24:48,876
Well, this is the deal.
You stay away from Tao. Understood?

976
01:24:48,963 --> 01:24:52,200
You say to your friends
that they remain near Tao.

977
01:24:52,287 --> 01:24:55,147
And if they do not listen to you
they will never see him.

978
01:24:55,232 --> 01:24:57,033
That was it. Understood?

979
01:24:57,120 --> 01:25:02,981
I take that as a 'yes' because if I have
in can be very unpleasant.

980
01:25:26,830 --> 01:25:29,283
Walk me in the way.

981
01:25:47,008 --> 01:25:51,163
How do you want your 'dog'?
I mean your steak?

982
01:25:51,249 --> 01:25:55,869
Funny.
- I told you, we only eat cats.

983
01:25:58,441 --> 01:26:00,339
I've never been so you have seen.

984
01:26:00,425 --> 01:26:03,520
I feel good.
I have beautiful women, great food.

985
01:26:03,605 --> 01:26:06,804
And Tao.
- And even Tao does not bother me.

986
01:26:06,890 --> 01:26:09,044
You have great meaning to you, I see.
- Yes.

987
01:26:09,130 --> 01:26:10,679
It never.

988
01:26:10,765 --> 01:26:14,037
What's also
with your knuckles happened?

989
01:26:14,588 --> 01:26:17,226
I slipped in the shower.
No big problem.

990
01:26:17,312 --> 01:26:22,197
Look, Yum-Yum. If he can not ask out,
I would ask you out.

991
01:26:22,284 --> 01:26:26,346
Wa Xam, do not listen to him.
He is the white devil.

992
01:26:26,431 --> 01:26:28,297
Yes, I am.
I'm the white devil.

993
01:26:28,382 --> 01:26:31,437
I would like to Walt,
but he has you.

994
01:26:31,522 --> 01:26:36,188
Really? Unbelievable!
From food and a movie, or what?

995
01:26:39,189 --> 01:26:42,561
Yes, they go by bus.

996
01:26:42,654 --> 01:26:47,435
No, you can not take the bus.
You need something with more style.

997
01:26:47,520 --> 01:26:50,601
Like what?
With a limo?

998
01:26:50,827 --> 01:26:53,205
How about that?

999
01:26:55,486 --> 01:26:57,914
Gran Torino?
- Yes.

1000
01:26:58,000 --> 01:27:02,820
You let me take the Gran Torino?
- Yes, I let you take the Gran Torino.

1001
01:27:02,905 --> 01:27:05,020
Really?

1002
01:27:05,484 --> 01:27:07,781
Yes, really.

1003
01:27:54,482 --> 01:27:56,807
Is everyone OK?

1004
01:28:00,573 --> 01:28:03,016
Tao!

1005
01:28:04,124 --> 01:28:07,686
It is good.
Where is Grandma?

1006
01:28:09,235 --> 01:28:11,379
Where's Sue?

1007
01:28:11,465 --> 01:28:13,485
Where's Sue?
- She is our aunt.

1008
01:28:13,572 --> 01:28:15,786
To her aunt? Are you sure?
- Yes.

1009
01:28:15,873 --> 01:28:18,748
Take the phone and call if it is.

1010
01:28:48,165 --> 01:28:50,127
Sue ...

1011
01:28:50,213 --> 01:28:53,559
I knew this would happen.

1012
01:28:54,012 --> 01:28:57,269
What am I doing here?

1013
01:28:57,356 --> 01:29:01,465
Perhaps one of her friends
call and have made other plans.

1014
01:29:01,550 --> 01:29:03,548
Yes.

1015
01:29:05,498 --> 01:29:11,952
During the war I lost many friends
but it is still on.

1016
01:29:12,039 --> 01:29:13,921
You do it.

1017
01:31:17,465 --> 01:31:19,840
Mr. Kowalski?

1018
01:31:29,430 --> 01:31:31,039
All right with you?

1019
01:31:31,124 --> 01:31:35,040
Yes, it is good to me.

1020
01:31:35,154 --> 01:31:39,219
The police has finally gone.
Nobody speaks.

1021
01:31:39,436 --> 01:31:42,405
One thing about the Hmong
and they keep their lips together.

1022
01:31:42,491 --> 01:31:45,181
Yes, that was me noticed.

1023
01:31:51,767 --> 01:31:57,190
You know, Tao and Sue will be in this
world never find peace ...

1024
01:31:57,276 --> 01:32:00,094
that as long as there are gangs.

1025
01:32:00,422 --> 01:32:04,670
Until they are gone.
You know, forever.

1026
01:32:06,665 --> 01:32:09,097
What do you say?

1027
01:32:09,454 --> 01:32:12,058
You know what I say.

1028
01:32:13,005 --> 01:32:15,368
I have Sue to the hospital.

1029
01:32:15,672 --> 01:32:17,691
She is afraid.

1030
01:32:17,777 --> 01:32:22,041
They are all afraid.
- Yes.

1031
01:32:23,118 --> 01:32:28,088
Special Tao.
He sits there staring at your front door.

1032
01:32:29,329 --> 01:32:32,664
You know what he expected Mr. Kowalski.

1033
01:32:33,195 --> 01:32:35,266
What would you do?

1034
01:32:35,881 --> 01:32:41,001
What would Tao to do?
- I know what I would do if I was you.

1035
01:32:41,265 --> 01:32:45,710
If you think you should do.
- Really?

1036
01:32:45,855 --> 01:32:49,133
If I was Tao
I would like to take revenge.

1037
01:32:49,497 --> 01:32:53,259
I would be shoulder to shoulder with you
and guests who want to murder.

1038
01:32:53,953 --> 01:32:58,102
And you?
- What would I do?

1039
01:33:00,728 --> 01:33:03,876
I would come here
and talk with you, I think.

1040
01:33:04,786 --> 01:33:09,290
I know that you are close with these people
but I also touch on the zeik, Mr. Kowalski.

1041
01:33:11,514 --> 01:33:15,133
Do you want a beer?
- Sure.

1042
01:33:15,219 --> 01:33:19,022
There are some in the fridge,
behind you

1043
01:33:43,790 --> 01:33:45,917
Fucking shit.

1044
01:33:46,909 --> 01:33:51,589
It's just not fair.
- Nothing is fair, Pastor.

1045
01:33:54,389 --> 01:33:57,040
What will you do now, Mr. Kowalski?

1046
01:33:58,509 --> 01:34:00,915
Call me Walt.

1047
01:34:01,611 --> 01:34:03,658
Well.

1048
01:34:04,432 --> 01:34:06,722
What will you do, Walt?

1049
01:34:07,056 --> 01:34:09,386
I do not know.

1050
01:34:09,605 --> 01:34:12,053
But I remember something.

1051
01:34:12,771 --> 01:34:16,861
Whatever it will be
they will have no chance.

1052
01:34:28,122 --> 01:34:30,043
What do you do?

1053
01:34:30,574 --> 01:34:32,003
Think.

1054
01:34:32,088 --> 01:34:35,002
Thinking?
Think time is over.

1055
01:34:35,087 --> 01:34:38,066
Now is the time in which acorns
off.

1056
01:34:38,567 --> 01:34:42,227
I know that you do not want to hear
but now it is time to remain calm.

1057
01:34:42,313 --> 01:34:44,727
Quiet?
Wil you that I remain quiet?

1058
01:34:44,812 --> 01:34:47,612
Keep quiet or else
mistakes are made.

1059
01:34:47,698 --> 01:34:50,657
We must take this same distance.

1060
01:34:50,743 --> 01:34:54,156
No. Let me fall, Walt.
Not you.

1061
01:34:54,242 --> 01:34:56,521
This will stop today!

1062
01:34:56,840 --> 01:34:58,055
Sit down.

1063
01:34:58,140 --> 01:35:01,731
I do not want to sit.
- I said, 'Sit down'.

1064
01:35:05,107 --> 01:35:06,877
Listen to me.

1065
01:35:06,962 --> 01:35:09,973
We need this plan.
And very careful plans.

1066
01:35:10,059 --> 01:35:11,889
We can not make mistakes.

1067
01:35:11,975 --> 01:35:15,376
You have the right man for the job.

1068
01:35:15,462 --> 01:35:20,697
I want you to go home, remain calm
at 4 o'clock this afternoon and return.

1069
01:35:20,928 --> 01:35:25,588
What should happen, will happen.
- I say that we are going. Now!

1070
01:35:25,674 --> 01:35:28,750
And then what? Those of you nephew murder
and the rest of the zeros?

1071
01:35:28,835 --> 01:35:34,730
Mr Stoere, out for blood.
You know nothing of.

1072
01:35:37,469 --> 01:35:39,998
Now go home and ...

1073
01:35:40,530 --> 01:35:46,206
stay calm and come here
four hours back. Good?

1074
01:35:46,347 --> 01:35:48,862
Good?

1075
01:35:50,691 --> 01:35:52,941
Well.

1076
01:36:22,865 --> 01:36:28,575
I know. Do me a favor, please.
The first time I smoke in the house.

1077
01:36:30,447 --> 01:36:35,033
Let the man enjoy the same,
wants you, girl?

1078
01:36:37,694 --> 01:36:40,189
Ready.
Ten U.S. dollars.

1079
01:36:40,275 --> 01:36:42,330
I suspect that
bibber using your hands enough

1080
01:36:42,415 --> 01:36:44,780
for a smooth shave to give?
- A smooth shave?

1081
01:36:44,866 --> 01:36:46,424
You've never
for a smooth shave requested.

1082
01:36:46,511 --> 01:36:48,390
I know, but I got you
always wondered how that is.

1083
01:36:48,477 --> 01:36:53,255
Unless you're too busy.
- No, let me warm up a towel.

1084
01:36:53,342 --> 01:36:55,282
And here's twenty.

1085
01:36:55,368 --> 01:37:00,136
Keep the change
in case you touched my neck vein.

1086
01:37:08,104 --> 01:37:13,738
Yes, it takes me an hour.
We need this here a little shorter.

1087
01:37:14,143 --> 01:37:16,708
We must make the appropriate shoulder.

1088
01:37:16,795 --> 01:37:19,686
Yes, I have never
one-styled suit had.

1089
01:37:19,773 --> 01:37:21,987
Yes, sir.

1090
01:37:22,572 --> 01:37:24,839
It looks very good.

1091
01:37:32,045 --> 01:37:36,717
What can I do for you, Mr.. Kowalski?
- I am here to confess.

1092
01:37:36,803 --> 01:37:40,375
Oh, what have you done?
- No, you do now but easy.

1093
01:37:40,460 --> 01:37:44,870
What are you planning?
- Do you take me to confess, or not?

1094
01:37:47,803 --> 01:37:50,412
How long ago is that you
last gebiecht have?

1095
01:37:50,498 --> 01:37:52,668
Forever.

1096
01:37:54,222 --> 01:37:59,762
Bless me, Reverend, for my sins.
- What are your sins, my son?

1097
01:38:02,676 --> 01:38:08,524
In 1968, I kissed Betty Jablonski
Christmas at the factory.

1098
01:38:08,609 --> 01:38:11,934
Dorothy was in another room
with the other women.

1099
01:38:12,295 --> 01:38:14,331
It just happened.

1100
01:38:14,762 --> 01:38:16,524
Yes, go on.

1101
01:38:16,610 --> 01:38:21,084
I have nine hundred dollars margins
by a boat and engine sales.

1102
01:38:21,417 --> 01:38:25,337
I have no tax paid
and that is the same as a steal.

1103
01:38:25,705 --> 01:38:28,012
Yes, good.

1104
01:38:28,535 --> 01:38:30,888
Finally ...

1105
01:38:31,725 --> 01:38:35,579
I was never very close with my two sons.

1106
01:38:35,826 --> 01:38:40,133
I do not know them.
I do not know how.

1107
01:38:41,513 --> 01:38:45,171
Was that it?
- That was it.

1108
01:38:45,346 --> 01:38:48,894
It was my entire life like.

1109
01:38:49,797 --> 01:38:53,076
Say ten 'Weesgegroetjes'
and five "Our Fathers."

1110
01:38:53,175 --> 01:38:57,420
God loves you and forgive you
And relieved you of your sins.

1111
01:38:57,505 --> 01:39:02,339
In the name of the Father,
the Son and the Holy Spirit.

1112
01:39:03,156 --> 01:39:05,943
Thank you, Pastor.

1113
01:39:08,995 --> 01:39:11,747
Will you ever take revenge
what has happened with Sue?

1114
01:39:12,732 --> 01:39:15,003
I go to that house today, Mr. Kowalski.

1115
01:39:15,090 --> 01:39:17,737
Is that so?
- That is so.

1116
01:39:17,824 --> 01:39:20,672
And every day until you see
that stupid is what you're planning.

1117
01:39:20,758 --> 01:39:25,164
Busy day, I gotta go.
- Go in peace.

1118
01:39:26,545 --> 01:39:29,380
Oh, I am peace.

1119
01:39:31,425 --> 01:39:34,007
Mighty God!

1120
01:39:47,419 --> 01:39:49,912
What is mine?

1121
01:39:50,838 --> 01:39:56,230
Have you ever shot with a gun?
- No.

1122
01:39:58,012 --> 01:40:00,662
I want you in it.

1123
01:40:00,747 --> 01:40:03,221
I have something I
you want to show, come on.

1124
01:40:03,306 --> 01:40:05,334
What?

1125
01:40:08,653 --> 01:40:13,791
In 1952, we were sent out
Chink-a strong point to overcome.

1126
01:40:13,878 --> 01:40:18,169
They had us nice suits.
I was the only one who came back that day.

1127
01:40:18,254 --> 01:40:22,599
This gave me a silver star.
Here it is.

1128
01:40:24,356 --> 01:40:27,325
Here, I want you to have it.

1129
01:40:27,816 --> 01:40:29,883
Why?

1130
01:40:30,389 --> 01:40:33,942
We all knew the danger that night
but we went anyway.

1131
01:40:34,028 --> 01:40:36,386
Thus it can also go tonight.

1132
01:40:36,473 --> 01:40:40,025
There is always a chance that you do not come back.
- The dead Thursday not.

1133
01:40:40,111 --> 01:40:41,797
We are going to go in there
and let them smell a poopy.

1134
01:40:41,882 --> 01:40:46,335
Yes, that would be stupid.
That is exactly the reaction they wait.

1135
01:40:46,422 --> 01:40:48,229
Come on, quit this.

1136
01:40:48,315 --> 01:40:51,759
How many?
- How much what?

1137
01:40:52,132 --> 01:40:55,061
How many men have you killed in Korea?

1138
01:40:55,174 --> 01:41:00,170
Thirteen, maybe more.
- How was it to kill a man?

1139
01:41:00,880 --> 01:41:03,891
That is you do not know.

1140
01:41:04,057 --> 01:41:06,708
Make it up.

1141
01:41:21,422 --> 01:41:25,324
Walt! Walt!
What are you doing?

1142
01:41:25,506 --> 01:41:27,628
What are you doing?

1143
01:41:27,714 --> 01:41:31,022
Calm down, because you can not.
- Let me now!

1144
01:41:31,108 --> 01:41:34,546
Let me out! Son of a bitch, let me out.
I kill you if I'm out!

1145
01:41:34,632 --> 01:41:35,908
Shut up!

1146
01:41:35,993 --> 01:41:38,330
Want to know how it is
to kill a man?

1147
01:41:38,415 --> 01:41:40,859
Well, it's horrible, it is.

1148
01:41:40,945 --> 01:41:43,877
The only thing worse is that you have a medal
courage to get, because you kill a poor boy,

1149
01:41:43,964 --> 01:41:46,935
who had just given.
That's all.

1150
01:41:47,021 --> 01:41:49,704
Yes, as a frightened gook, just like you.

1151
01:41:49,789 --> 01:41:53,776
I shot him right in his face with that gun
you just have taken down there.

1152
01:41:53,862 --> 01:41:58,446
Not a day goes by that I do not think.
You don 't want your soul.

1153
01:41:58,938 --> 01:42:01,697
I have blood on my hands.
I'm tainted.

1154
01:42:01,783 --> 01:42:05,053
So tonight I go alone.

1155
01:42:05,139 --> 01:42:09,077
Walt, take me with you!
Let me out!

1156
01:42:09,186 --> 01:42:12,004
Look, you've come a long way.

1157
01:42:12,090 --> 01:42:15,814
I am proud to say that my
friend. But you have your whole life for you.

1158
01:42:15,900 --> 01:42:21,953
But I? I end things.
That is what I do. And I go alone.

1159
01:42:22,061 --> 01:42:25,192
No, wait.
Walt!

1160
01:42:44,413 --> 01:42:47,252
I want you on my dog pass.

1161
01:42:49,320 --> 01:42:51,767
Yes, I love yours

1162
01:42:56,807 --> 01:42:59,826
Yes, she is also old.

1163
01:43:02,786 --> 01:43:05,643
Her name is Daisy.

1164
01:43:21,912 --> 01:43:23,581
Hello.
- Here is Walt.

1165
01:43:23,667 --> 01:43:27,117
The key to my house under
the ceramic turtle at the front.

1166
01:43:27,202 --> 01:43:32,081
Let yourself within.
Your brother is in the basement. I gotta go.

1167
01:43:47,708 --> 01:43:50,195
Sorry, Reverend.
We gotta go.

1168
01:43:50,649 --> 01:43:54,094
I tell you,
if you are not there, there will be blood flow.

1169
01:43:54,181 --> 01:43:55,693
We have been here hours.

1170
01:43:55,779 --> 01:43:58,419
We can not afford
to a unit in a location to hold.

1171
01:43:58,504 --> 01:44:00,618
I beg you to stay.

1172
01:44:00,703 --> 01:44:04,154
I have command of my sergeant.
We pull the plug out.

1173
01:44:04,287 --> 01:44:07,429
I'll stay.
- No, you do not.

1174
01:44:08,570 --> 01:44:12,624
We have a clear mission.
You came with us and you can take us away.

1175
01:44:12,710 --> 01:44:14,769
Watch your head.

1176
01:44:23,923 --> 01:44:26,876
Sue, on this side.
This side.

1177
01:44:26,963 --> 01:44:28,394
Let me out.

1178
01:44:28,480 --> 01:44:30,057
He is left without me.

1179
01:44:30,143 --> 01:44:32,570
He has gone without me Smokies.

1180
01:44:33,683 --> 01:44:35,839
Tao!

1181
01:45:05,417 --> 01:45:08,397
Are there within swamp rats?

1182
01:45:08,902 --> 01:45:12,393
I did not think that you would come.
- Shut up, gook.

1183
01:45:13,027 --> 01:45:17,544
I have nothing to say, under door.
A dwarf like you.

1184
01:45:20,180 --> 01:45:24,379
Yes, yes.
Go ahead, look out for your boyfriend.

1185
01:45:24,464 --> 01:45:29,385
Because it was either he or you or anyone else
someone of your own family raped.

1186
01:45:29,471 --> 01:45:32,272
Create your own blood, in hell.

1187
01:45:32,358 --> 01:45:36,169
Go ahead and you pull your gun,
as dwarf Cowboy's.

1188
01:45:36,255 --> 01:45:37,871
Go your way.

1189
01:45:37,957 --> 01:45:40,770
Where is Tao?
Could not that what you are?

1190
01:45:40,856 --> 01:45:42,912
Do not worry about Tao.

1191
01:45:42,997 --> 01:45:46,310
Tao has no second time for you.

1192
01:45:46,561 --> 01:45:50,208
Who says that?
You?

1193
01:45:50,882 --> 01:45:53,945
What do you do to hell, old man?

1194
01:45:56,007 --> 01:45:58,593
What are you doing, old man?
- Pussy.

1195
01:45:59,711 --> 01:46:02,608
A little schrikkerig, or not?
- Shut up.

1196
01:46:02,694 --> 01:46:05,792
Keep you mouth.

1197
01:46:16,247 --> 01:46:18,774
Got a light?
- Fuck you.

1198
01:46:23,132 --> 01:46:25,423
No.

1199
01:46:25,509 --> 01:46:30,392
I ...
I have a fire.

1200
01:46:32,931 --> 01:46:36,631
'Hail Mary, full of grace. "

1201
01:47:41,482 --> 01:47:42,950
Yes, sergeant.

1202
01:47:43,036 --> 01:47:44,910
What happened?
- You must make a pass backwards.

1203
01:47:44,995 --> 01:47:48,339
He is a friend of mine.
- He said: 'a backward pass. "

1204
01:47:49,873 --> 01:47:51,660
Hey, have you heard him?
A pass backwards.

1205
01:47:51,746 --> 01:47:54,309
What happened?
- Hey, a pass backwards.

1206
01:47:54,395 --> 01:47:56,535
Let me, he is my friend.

1207
01:47:56,622 --> 01:47:58,892
Please, it's important.

1208
01:47:59,065 --> 01:48:01,627
He took his lighter
and they shot him down.

1209
01:48:01,713 --> 01:48:05,119
He had no gun with him.

1210
01:48:06,993 --> 01:48:08,805
This time, we have witnesses.

1211
01:48:08,892 --> 01:48:10,798
These guys we wanted
have long detention.

1212
01:48:10,884 --> 01:48:16,181
Chang Agent! Send these people back!
- Now a pass backwards, okay?

1213
01:48:35,650 --> 01:48:38,832
If the thunder here.
Get them here.

1214
01:50:16,406 --> 01:50:20,813
Walt Kowalski once said to me,
I knew nothing about life and death.

1215
01:50:20,899 --> 01:50:28,132
Because I trained a lot, 27 year old virgin,
that the basis of superstitious old women did

1216
01:50:28,217 --> 01:50:31,087
and promised them eternal life.

1217
01:50:31,436 --> 01:50:35,008
Walt had no problem with that
to name as he saw it.

1218
01:50:35,094 --> 01:50:37,366
But he was right.

1219
01:50:37,453 --> 01:50:43,247
I knew nothing about life and death,
Walt until I know.

1220
01:50:43,692 --> 01:50:46,399
And guys, what have I learned.

1221
01:50:52,364 --> 01:50:57,392
Then I leave my house to the church after
because Dorothy would have wanted.

1222
01:50:59,627 --> 01:51:04,328
That brings us to the last point. And again,
Excuse me for the language,

1223
01:51:04,414 --> 01:51:08,703
in the testament of Mr. Kowalski, I read
simple as it is written.

1224
01:51:09,818 --> 01:51:15,679
And I would like my Gran Torino in 1972,
Failure to ...

1225
01:51:19,720 --> 01:51:22,083
my friend ...

1226
01:51:23,161 --> 01:51:26,506
Lor Vang Tao.

1227
01:51:26,592 --> 01:51:30,994
Provided that your roof is not fucked,
as one of the cocks,

1228
01:51:31,081 --> 01:51:35,888
<i> paint no stupid flames out, as
that 'white trash' boerenkinkels, </ i></i>

1229
01:51:35,974 --> 01:51:41,561
<i> not gay spoiler and place at the end
as you'll see that other nitwit cars. </ i></i>

1230
01:51:41,647 --> 01:51:43,260
<i> It does not look. </ i></i>

1231
01:51:43,347 --> 01:51:48,557
<i>If you  all abstains
it is yours. </ i></i>

1232
01:52:09,900 --> 01:52:14,650
