1
00:00:02,535 --> 00:00:04,537
(glass breaking)

2
00:00:19,285 --> 00:00:22,222
(reflective piano)

3
00:01:37,130 --> 00:01:40,066
(birds chirping)

4
00:01:59,052 --> 00:02:03,623
- [Brad Voiceover] By now, you probably know what I'm up to.

5
00:02:03,656 --> 00:02:05,859
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about what was going on,

6
00:02:05,892 --> 00:02:06,993
face to face.

7
00:02:08,561 --> 00:02:11,264
(tempered piano)

8
00:05:14,347 --> 00:05:17,016
(people talking)

9
00:06:05,498 --> 00:06:08,167
(birds chirping)

10
00:06:09,168 --> 00:06:12,672
(waves splashing on shore)

11
00:06:51,511 --> 00:06:53,980
(exotic bells)

12
00:10:54,787 --> 00:10:58,691
(reggae song with man singing)

13
00:11:07,733 --> 00:11:09,902
- Yeah, I can see that you're over a week past due

14
00:11:09,935 --> 00:11:12,705
on the account, so we were wondering when we could expect

15
00:11:12,738 --> 00:11:14,306
the minimum payment.

16
00:11:15,708 --> 00:11:16,475
Uh-huh.

17
00:11:17,743 --> 00:11:19,211
No, yes, yes, yes, no, I understand.

18
00:11:19,245 --> 00:11:20,046
Yes.

19
00:11:21,580 --> 00:11:22,381
Yeah, so,

20
00:11:24,450 --> 00:11:26,018
when can we expect the minimum payment?

21
00:11:26,052 --> 00:11:28,387
Is it any sooner than that?

22
00:11:29,789 --> 00:11:33,359
Can I put you down for tomorrow instead of Wednesday?

23
00:11:33,392 --> 00:11:37,296
Okay, how about tomorrow instead of Wednesday?

24
00:11:37,329 --> 00:11:39,432
Okay, then, Tuesday it is.

25
00:11:39,465 --> 00:11:42,668
Thank you for being a valued customer.

26
00:11:44,937 --> 00:11:47,606
(people talking)

27
00:12:04,790 --> 00:12:07,293
Hi, is this Mr. David Bizona.

28
00:13:17,563 --> 00:13:20,366
(acoustic guitar)

29
00:15:27,126 --> 00:15:30,095
We can see that you are over two weeks past due

30
00:15:30,129 --> 00:15:32,097
on your account, and so, we were wondering

31
00:15:32,131 --> 00:15:35,868
when we could expect the minimum payment.

32
00:15:35,901 --> 00:15:37,970
Uh-huh, uh-huh, any sooner?

33
00:15:41,507 --> 00:15:45,044
Can I put you down for tomorrow instead of Friday?

34
00:15:45,077 --> 00:15:46,345
Uh-huh.

35
00:15:46,378 --> 00:15:49,481
No, so that's tomorrow instead of Friday, so then,

36
00:15:49,515 --> 00:15:52,351
can I put you down for tomorrow then?

37
00:15:52,384 --> 00:15:53,819
Is that correct?

38
00:15:54,687 --> 00:15:56,655
Okay, Wednesday it is then.

39
00:15:56,689 --> 00:15:59,892
Thank you for being a valued customer.

40
00:16:02,094 --> 00:16:04,930
(phone ringing)

41
00:16:21,914 --> 00:16:25,017
- How are the taxes coming along?

42
00:16:25,050 --> 00:16:25,851
- Fine.

43
00:16:27,386 --> 00:16:30,689
(wind blowing outside)

44
00:17:15,134 --> 00:17:18,137
- Goodness fine handsome Brad.

45
00:17:18,170 --> 00:17:21,140
- And you must be the fine sexy Yenny.

46
00:17:22,508 --> 00:17:23,842
- I am, indeed.

47
00:17:25,811 --> 00:17:27,112
- Wow.

48
00:17:27,146 --> 00:17:31,884
It's really, it's really great to see you, for real.

49
00:17:31,917 --> 00:17:36,121
I mean, after I didn't hear from you all day, I thought.

50
00:17:37,790 --> 00:17:40,125
- What'd you think?

51
00:17:40,159 --> 00:17:41,193
- I don't know.

52
00:17:42,761 --> 00:17:44,797
- My cell phone is past due, so I can't text again

53
00:17:44,830 --> 00:17:46,265
until I pay all.

54
00:17:48,333 --> 00:17:50,569
- You're so pretty.

55
00:17:50,602 --> 00:17:51,637
- Like a girl?

56
00:17:51,670 --> 00:17:53,172
- No. No, just...

57
00:17:55,107 --> 00:17:57,176
You're beautiful.

58
00:17:57,209 --> 00:17:58,811
How old are you again?

59
00:17:58,844 --> 00:17:59,645
- 23. You?

60
00:18:02,614 --> 00:18:03,382
- I'm 42.

61
00:18:06,785 --> 00:18:08,587
- Not 39 like in your profile?

62
00:18:08,620 --> 00:18:12,825
- Yeah, no, I guess I'm a little nervous about my age.

63
00:18:13,792 --> 00:18:15,494
- I like that you're older.

64
00:18:15,527 --> 00:18:17,696
- Really? It doesn't bother you?

65
00:18:17,729 --> 00:18:20,232
- No, no, no, I like, I like.

66
00:18:21,467 --> 00:18:24,203
Do they call you Bradley, like Bradley Cooper?

67
00:18:24,236 --> 00:18:25,337
You're very handsome.

68
00:18:25,370 --> 00:18:26,338
Do you like him?

69
00:18:26,371 --> 00:18:28,440
- I mean, he's okay, I guess.

70
00:18:28,474 --> 00:18:31,977
- So, what are you doing tonight in New York City,

71
00:18:32,010 --> 00:18:33,712
Mr. Bradley Cooper?

72
00:18:33,745 --> 00:18:35,714
It must be very fun there.

73
00:18:35,747 --> 00:18:37,616
Jamaica is so boring.

74
00:18:37,649 --> 00:18:38,717
- Really?

75
00:18:38,750 --> 00:18:41,220
It seemed pretty nice to me.

76
00:18:41,253 --> 00:18:44,223
- Well, not if you're homosexual.

77
00:18:44,256 --> 00:18:45,257
- Oh, right.

78
00:18:46,358 --> 00:18:48,360
And, are you homosexual?

79
00:18:50,863 --> 00:18:53,198
- Yes, Daddy Brad. Aren't you?

80
00:18:58,203 --> 00:18:59,805
It's okay, you don't have to answer.

81
00:18:59,838 --> 00:19:01,240
- No, I'm sorry.

82
00:19:02,774 --> 00:19:06,145
I'm just doing a little work while I'm talking to you.

83
00:19:06,178 --> 00:19:08,313
- Do you come to Jamaica often?

84
00:19:08,347 --> 00:19:09,114
- Yeah.

85
00:19:10,415 --> 00:19:12,584
- Great, then we'll hook up next time.

86
00:19:12,618 --> 00:19:13,418
- Sure.

87
00:19:17,389 --> 00:19:19,258
So, where are you now?

88
00:19:19,291 --> 00:19:21,360
- I'm in the bedroom.

89
00:19:21,393 --> 00:19:23,095
I live with me uncle.

90
00:19:24,229 --> 00:19:26,198
For how long, I don't know.

91
00:19:26,231 --> 00:19:27,432
- Why is that?

92
00:19:31,069 --> 00:19:35,274
- I think he's starting to suspect that I'm, you know.

93
00:19:37,042 --> 00:19:39,144
- Oh. Oh, you're not out?

94
00:19:41,046 --> 00:19:42,381
- Hell no.

95
00:19:42,414 --> 00:19:44,249
This is Jamaica, man.

96
00:19:44,283 --> 00:19:48,187
Ain't nobody out that don't want to get beat up or worse.

97
00:19:48,220 --> 00:19:51,023
- And you're uncle thinks you're gay,

98
00:19:51,056 --> 00:19:52,524
but how would he know?

99
00:19:52,558 --> 00:19:57,396
- He in everybody business, and I don't have a girlfriend.

100
00:19:57,429 --> 00:19:59,398
- But what about the rest of your family?

101
00:19:59,431 --> 00:20:01,300
- Well, that's the thing.

102
00:20:03,669 --> 00:20:07,039
My mother is dead, and my father won't have me either.

103
00:20:07,072 --> 00:20:07,839
- Oh.

104
00:20:09,408 --> 00:20:10,442
I'm sorry.

105
00:20:11,243 --> 00:20:12,444
- Yes, me too.

106
00:20:14,346 --> 00:20:17,616
She got cancer when I was eight, and died.

107
00:20:17,649 --> 00:20:19,318
I went to go live with my father,

108
00:20:19,351 --> 00:20:21,453
until he got a new wife.

109
00:20:21,486 --> 00:20:23,655
She don't like it when he paid me more attention,

110
00:20:23,689 --> 00:20:27,392
so when I turned 16, she made up some bullshit

111
00:20:27,426 --> 00:20:30,896
about me stealing, and demanded that I leave.

112
00:20:30,929 --> 00:20:33,432
What are you going to do?

113
00:20:33,465 --> 00:20:37,669
He is now with his new wife, and he choose pussy over blood.

114
00:20:40,872 --> 00:20:42,741
He said it was better if I came and lived here,

115
00:20:42,774 --> 00:20:44,910
with his sister.

116
00:20:44,943 --> 00:20:47,746
At first, he had paid for me, but,

117
00:20:47,779 --> 00:20:50,248
once I got to be 21, he said it was time

118
00:20:50,282 --> 00:20:51,984
for me to be on my own.

119
00:20:52,017 --> 00:20:53,318
- So, do you have a job?

120
00:20:53,352 --> 00:20:54,786
- Not anymore.

121
00:20:54,820 --> 00:20:57,122
I never finished high school proper,

122
00:20:57,155 --> 00:21:00,359
and I never went to university.

123
00:21:00,392 --> 00:21:02,361
- What are you gonna do?

124
00:21:02,394 --> 00:21:03,462
- I don't know.

125
00:21:05,297 --> 00:21:06,999
- I'm sorry, Yenny.

126
00:21:08,133 --> 00:21:09,368
- That's okay.

127
00:21:09,401 --> 00:21:11,136
At least I met you.

128
00:21:12,971 --> 00:21:16,775
- Are you sure you don't have a Jamaican boyfriend?

129
00:21:16,808 --> 00:21:18,543
A guy like you?

130
00:21:18,577 --> 00:21:20,045
- A guy like me.

131
00:21:20,078 --> 00:21:21,513
I'm not special.

132
00:21:22,814 --> 00:21:24,716
I'm one among millions.

133
00:21:26,218 --> 00:21:27,919
I wish I was special.

134
00:21:29,087 --> 00:21:32,291
My mother made me feel special.

135
00:21:32,324 --> 00:21:33,358
My mother.

136
00:21:36,695 --> 00:21:39,297
She would take me everywhere.

137
00:21:39,331 --> 00:21:42,334
We lived up near her parent's farm, up in the mountains,

138
00:21:42,367 --> 00:21:44,736
and he brewed coffee, there, and then,

139
00:21:44,770 --> 00:21:46,538
I would help him bake the beans sometimes.

140
00:21:46,571 --> 00:21:48,306
It's much cooler up in the mountains,

141
00:21:48,340 --> 00:21:51,576
not so hot and sticky as it is down here,

142
00:21:51,610 --> 00:21:53,745
and the farm was close with a manner of James Bond.

143
00:21:53,779 --> 00:21:55,847
My grandfather remembers me to him.

144
00:21:55,881 --> 00:21:57,249
(chuckling)

145
00:21:57,282 --> 00:22:00,419
I was debased when I was younger too,

146
00:22:03,021 --> 00:22:04,456
when she was alive.

147
00:22:05,724 --> 00:22:08,093
It was still pretty good in high school,

148
00:22:08,126 --> 00:22:09,895
up until I had to drop out.

149
00:22:09,928 --> 00:22:11,396
- Because of your stepmother?

150
00:22:11,430 --> 00:22:12,364
- Yes, yes.

151
00:22:14,132 --> 00:22:17,536
Because of her, I had to move out,

152
00:22:17,569 --> 00:22:20,572
but by the time I moved in with me aunts,

153
00:22:20,605 --> 00:22:23,608
I had no interest in finishing school.

154
00:22:23,642 --> 00:22:27,345
- You've been through so much, Yenny.

155
00:22:27,379 --> 00:22:29,548
I wish I could do something.

156
00:22:29,581 --> 00:22:32,150
- Well, you are my daddy, right?

157
00:22:36,088 --> 00:22:38,123
- Is that what you want me to be?

158
00:22:38,156 --> 00:22:39,624
- And I'm your boy.

159
00:22:43,295 --> 00:22:44,096
- Yeah.

160
00:22:45,564 --> 00:22:49,601
- I want to be your little Jamaican pussy boy.

161
00:22:51,503 --> 00:22:54,172
- Then, then that's what you are.

162
00:22:57,109 --> 00:22:58,543
- Yeah.

163
00:22:58,577 --> 00:22:59,978
- Do you like...

164
00:23:02,180 --> 00:23:04,082
Do you like calling me your daddy?

165
00:23:04,116 --> 00:23:07,052
- I love calling you that.

166
00:23:07,085 --> 00:23:10,055
That's because you are my daddy, right?

167
00:23:10,088 --> 00:23:10,856
- Yeah.

168
00:23:12,424 --> 00:23:13,592
- And what am I?

169
00:23:17,462 --> 00:23:18,497
It's okay, Daddy.

170
00:23:18,530 --> 00:23:20,399
You can say it to me.

171
00:23:20,432 --> 00:23:21,633
I want you to.

172
00:23:26,638 --> 00:23:29,141
It's just between you and me.

173
00:23:35,614 --> 00:23:36,815
- You're my...

174
00:23:42,154 --> 00:23:44,923
You're my Jamaican pussy boy.

175
00:23:44,956 --> 00:23:46,057
- Hell, yeah.

176
00:23:47,459 --> 00:23:50,495
Daddy, can I show you something?

177
00:23:50,529 --> 00:23:51,229
- Yeah.

178
00:23:52,631 --> 00:23:54,466
- Yeah, what?

179
00:23:54,499 --> 00:23:55,367
- Yes, boy.

180
00:23:59,538 --> 00:24:01,540
- See what you do to me?

181
00:24:03,642 --> 00:24:04,543
Do you see?

182
00:24:05,677 --> 00:24:06,778
- Oh, God.

183
00:24:06,812 --> 00:24:07,779
- Do you like?

184
00:24:07,813 --> 00:24:08,980
- Yes.

185
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:09,981
- Do you like, Daddy?

186
00:24:10,015 --> 00:24:11,082
- Yeah. Yeah.

187
00:24:13,418 --> 00:24:16,021
- Can I show you something else?

188
00:24:18,256 --> 00:24:20,692
Do you like this too, Daddy?

189
00:24:29,601 --> 00:24:31,703
Is my daddy getting hard?

190
00:24:31,736 --> 00:24:32,838
- Yes.

191
00:24:32,871 --> 00:24:33,872
- Can I see?

192
00:24:36,608 --> 00:24:37,676
- Really?

193
00:24:37,709 --> 00:24:38,510
- Yes.

194
00:24:50,522 --> 00:24:53,024
Daddy's got a big white dick.

195
00:24:56,728 --> 00:24:58,563
I can't wait to suck on it.

196
00:24:58,597 --> 00:25:01,533
Feel it inside this tight Jamaican boy pussy.

197
00:25:01,566 --> 00:25:03,034
- Yes, I want that too.

198
00:25:03,068 --> 00:25:04,603
- Next time you come to Jamaica,

199
00:25:04,636 --> 00:25:05,704
can we go someplace special?

200
00:25:05,737 --> 00:25:07,339
- Sure.

201
00:25:07,372 --> 00:25:11,776
- Yes, so I want to spend time with you, and be free.

202
00:25:11,810 --> 00:25:14,246
- Is there a place like that?

203
00:25:14,279 --> 00:25:16,715
- There's a place near me father's holy farm.

204
00:25:16,748 --> 00:25:17,716
We can go there.

205
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:18,917
It's very cool.

206
00:25:18,950 --> 00:25:21,620
We'd be very comfortable there.

207
00:25:21,653 --> 00:25:24,256
There are waterfalls, and pools,

208
00:25:25,390 --> 00:25:28,860
and we can swim naked there together.

209
00:25:28,894 --> 00:25:29,895
Have you ever done that?

210
00:25:29,928 --> 00:25:31,563
- No.

211
00:25:31,596 --> 00:25:32,831
- Do you want to?

212
00:25:34,966 --> 00:25:36,468
- Yes.

213
00:25:36,501 --> 00:25:37,302
- Great.

214
00:25:39,137 --> 00:25:40,572
Then we do that.

215
00:25:42,340 --> 00:25:44,643
- I like you, Yenny.

216
00:25:44,676 --> 00:25:46,945
- I like you too, Daddy Brad.

217
00:25:46,978 --> 00:25:47,779
I like.

218
00:25:53,919 --> 00:25:56,054
- So, I should probably get going.

219
00:25:56,087 --> 00:25:58,390
It's getting late.

220
00:25:58,423 --> 00:25:59,658
- Ah, really?

221
00:25:59,691 --> 00:26:04,663
- Yeah, I have to work early in the morning, so...

222
00:26:04,696 --> 00:26:05,630
- Okay.

223
00:26:05,664 --> 00:26:08,633
Can I show you something before you go?

224
00:26:08,667 --> 00:26:11,603
- Sure, but, I mean, you just showed me a lot.

225
00:26:11,636 --> 00:26:13,038
- You're stupid.

226
00:26:17,542 --> 00:26:19,010
- Wow.

227
00:26:19,044 --> 00:26:19,978
- It's you.

228
00:26:21,646 --> 00:26:23,348
- Yeah, I see that.

229
00:26:25,817 --> 00:26:26,985
That's very sweet.

230
00:26:27,018 --> 00:26:29,154
- Well, you are my daddy.

231
00:26:30,388 --> 00:26:32,457
- Well, I guess I am, if I'm on your phone.

232
00:26:32,490 --> 00:26:35,293
(chuckling)

233
00:26:35,327 --> 00:26:38,630
- Well, goodnight for now, me sexy daddy.

234
00:26:46,738 --> 00:26:48,907
(chuckling)

235
00:26:54,679 --> 00:26:55,714
- Bye.

236
00:26:56,581 --> 00:26:57,816
- Night night.

237
00:27:22,273 --> 00:27:24,943
(people talking)

238
00:27:27,946 --> 00:27:29,214
- Who's this?

239
00:27:29,247 --> 00:27:31,149
- [Man on Phone] Is this Dr. Bradley O'Connor?

240
00:27:31,182 --> 00:27:34,652
Yes, what is this in reference to?

241
00:27:34,686 --> 00:27:37,589
- [Man on Phone] And how are you today?

242
00:27:37,622 --> 00:27:39,724
- I'm hunky dory.

243
00:27:39,758 --> 00:27:41,092
- [Man on Phone] Oh, well that's wonderful.

244
00:27:41,126 --> 00:27:43,661
So, I'm calling today about your Scotia Bank credit card.

245
00:27:43,695 --> 00:27:45,930
I believe you have the silver platinum.

246
00:27:45,964 --> 00:27:48,066
We've noticed that you're over two weeks past due

247
00:27:48,099 --> 00:27:49,834
on the account, and so, we're wondering

248
00:27:49,868 --> 00:27:53,438
when we could expect the minimum payment.

249
00:27:53,471 --> 00:27:54,372
Dr. Connor.

250
00:27:57,075 --> 00:27:59,444
- [Brad] So, have you ever thought about coming here,

251
00:27:59,477 --> 00:28:00,879
to the United States?

252
00:28:00,912 --> 00:28:02,747
- [Yenny] Are you inviting me, Daddy?

253
00:28:02,781 --> 00:28:04,549
- [Brad] Well...

254
00:28:04,582 --> 00:28:07,585
- I've always wanted to visit New York City.

255
00:28:07,619 --> 00:28:09,587
It must be so much fun there.

256
00:28:09,621 --> 00:28:11,723
- So, why haven't you yet?

257
00:28:11,756 --> 00:28:14,793
- Well, first you need a passport.

258
00:28:15,927 --> 00:28:17,796
Then, you need a visa.

259
00:28:17,829 --> 00:28:19,397
- Are you, really?

260
00:28:19,431 --> 00:28:22,033
'Cause Americans don't need visas to visit Jamaica.

261
00:28:22,067 --> 00:28:24,202
- That's right, you don't need a visa

262
00:28:24,235 --> 00:28:26,938
to visit Jamaica, but we need a visa to visit you.

263
00:28:26,971 --> 00:28:28,206
- Are you sure?

264
00:28:28,239 --> 00:28:29,908
- I'm most definitely sure, Daddy Brad.

265
00:28:29,941 --> 00:28:33,411
Jamaica needs your tourists, you don't need ours.

266
00:28:33,445 --> 00:28:35,780
And so, between the money for everything,

267
00:28:35,814 --> 00:28:39,117
and the flight, well, I just can't afford it.

268
00:28:39,150 --> 00:28:40,718
- That's not fair.

269
00:28:40,752 --> 00:28:42,954
- No, sir, it is not fair.

270
00:28:44,155 --> 00:28:47,525
- So, I was thinking, how much do you owe

271
00:28:50,795 --> 00:28:52,564
on your cell phone bill?

272
00:28:52,597 --> 00:28:54,833
- I owe about 2,500 Jamaican.

273
00:28:57,802 --> 00:29:00,839
- Wow, how much is that US?

274
00:29:00,872 --> 00:29:02,674
- About 25 US dollars.

275
00:29:03,975 --> 00:29:04,776
- Oh.

276
00:29:05,844 --> 00:29:09,547
Well, 'cause I was thinking that maybe, um,

277
00:29:10,882 --> 00:29:14,752
maybe I would help you pay for your cell phone bill.

278
00:29:14,786 --> 00:29:16,855
- Really, Daddy?

279
00:29:16,888 --> 00:29:17,856
You would do that?

280
00:29:17,889 --> 00:29:19,090
- Sure, why not?

281
00:29:19,124 --> 00:29:21,025
I mean, it's only 25 bucks.

282
00:29:21,059 --> 00:29:22,093
- Oh, my God, Daddy.

283
00:29:22,127 --> 00:29:23,461
That would be amazing.

284
00:29:23,495 --> 00:29:25,130
Then I can text you during the day.

285
00:29:25,163 --> 00:29:28,933
- Yeah, that's what I was thinking.

286
00:29:28,967 --> 00:29:30,201
- So you know how to do it?

287
00:29:30,235 --> 00:29:31,703
- No.

288
00:29:31,736 --> 00:29:32,971
- You can send the money online.

289
00:29:33,004 --> 00:29:34,939
Then, I can pick it up, and go pay me bill.

290
00:29:34,973 --> 00:29:36,975
- Okay, can I do that tomorrow morning?

291
00:29:37,008 --> 00:29:38,810
- That would be great.

292
00:29:40,011 --> 00:29:43,481
I'm so happy me daddy really does love me.

293
00:29:43,515 --> 00:29:44,783
Don't you?

294
00:29:44,816 --> 00:29:46,217
- Yes.

295
00:29:46,251 --> 00:29:47,051
- Yes...

296
00:29:49,254 --> 00:29:50,488
Uh?

297
00:29:50,522 --> 00:29:53,324
- Yes, my Jamaican pussy boy.

298
00:29:53,358 --> 00:29:55,193
- I love when you call me that.

299
00:29:55,226 --> 00:29:57,562
- I think I love saying it.

300
00:29:59,831 --> 00:30:01,933
- So, I was thinking...

301
00:30:03,268 --> 00:30:06,237
If you could I put in a few extra dollars,

302
00:30:06,271 --> 00:30:09,240
I could do some special for you.

303
00:30:09,274 --> 00:30:10,842
- Like...

304
00:30:10,875 --> 00:30:13,511
- I want it to be a surprise for me daddy.

305
00:30:13,545 --> 00:30:16,247
- Well, how much are you talking about?

306
00:30:16,281 --> 00:30:18,283
- Can you lend me 50 US?

307
00:30:21,252 --> 00:30:22,053
- Sure.

308
00:30:23,221 --> 00:30:25,290
- I'm so lucky I met you.

309
00:30:28,793 --> 00:30:30,061
Is my daddy okay?

310
00:30:30,094 --> 00:30:31,062
Did I do something wrong?

311
00:30:31,095 --> 00:30:32,230
- No, no, no.

312
00:30:33,031 --> 00:30:34,866
It's fine. I just...

313
00:30:36,801 --> 00:30:38,336
It's nothing.

314
00:30:38,369 --> 00:30:40,572
- You don't have to give me the money if that's it.

315
00:30:40,605 --> 00:30:41,839
I still like you.

316
00:30:41,873 --> 00:30:43,041
- No, it's okay.

317
00:30:44,108 --> 00:30:45,276
- You sure?

318
00:30:45,310 --> 00:30:46,945
- Yes. Absolutely.

319
00:30:48,079 --> 00:30:49,581
- Okay, Daddy Brad.

320
00:30:52,550 --> 00:30:55,753
I know that you don't feel the same way about me, yet,

321
00:30:55,787 --> 00:30:58,223
but I hope that you do someday.

322
00:30:58,256 --> 00:31:02,193
I just want to say that I love you so much.

323
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,462
You're the hottest man I've ever met,

324
00:31:04,495 --> 00:31:06,798
and you treat me so nicely.

325
00:31:08,066 --> 00:31:10,635
You respect me, you talk to me about things,

326
00:31:10,668 --> 00:31:14,906
and I know that we play talk a lot, but, seriously,

327
00:31:16,574 --> 00:31:19,777
anyone who ever get to be your son,

328
00:31:19,811 --> 00:31:23,047
will be the luckiest person in the world,

329
00:31:23,081 --> 00:31:27,385
and I hope that I can be yours someday, all yours.

330
00:31:27,418 --> 00:31:29,921
- You're very sweet, Yenny.

331
00:31:29,954 --> 00:31:32,290
I hope so too, I really do.

332
00:31:33,825 --> 00:31:38,730
- Well, then get a big fuck daddy dick down here,

333
00:31:38,763 --> 00:31:41,299
so you can break this tight Jamaican boy pussy.

334
00:31:41,332 --> 00:31:44,936
- You really like to talk dirty, don't you?

335
00:31:44,969 --> 00:31:45,970
- Don't you?

336
00:31:46,938 --> 00:31:47,839
- Well, um.

337
00:31:49,107 --> 00:31:52,010
I'm kinda new at this, so...

338
00:31:52,043 --> 00:31:54,245
- Yeah, I thought so.

339
00:31:54,279 --> 00:31:56,948
- It's that easy to tell, huh?

340
00:31:56,981 --> 00:32:00,985
- That's what makes my daddy so adorable.

341
00:32:01,019 --> 00:32:03,488
I know that you would wrap your arms around me,

342
00:32:03,521 --> 00:32:05,323
and hold me all night.

343
00:32:06,491 --> 00:32:09,794
- You do know the perfect thing to say.

344
00:32:11,963 --> 00:32:12,997
So, um...

345
00:32:14,866 --> 00:32:16,534
I should probably go get dinner.

346
00:32:16,567 --> 00:32:21,439
- Ah, Daddy, always has something, when I get so horny.

347
00:32:21,472 --> 00:32:24,242
I guess we can wait another night.

348
00:32:25,143 --> 00:32:27,679
- Bye, my sweet Jamaican boy.

349
00:32:29,180 --> 00:32:32,083
- Pussy boy, but you're learning.

350
00:32:35,320 --> 00:32:37,021
- Goodnight, Yenny.

351
00:32:50,268 --> 00:32:52,170
Okay, Saturday it is then.

352
00:32:52,203 --> 00:32:55,506
Thank you for being a valued customer.

353
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,508
(people talking)

354
00:32:57,542 --> 00:33:00,111
(phone ringing)

355
00:34:04,642 --> 00:34:07,578
Yeah, hi, is this Mr. Roger Morgan?

356
00:34:19,157 --> 00:34:22,860
So, when can we expect the minimum payment?

357
00:34:24,295 --> 00:34:25,163
Any sooner?

358
00:34:26,130 --> 00:34:28,266
Yeah, so can we expect the minimum payment,

359
00:34:28,299 --> 00:34:33,237
can you send them, can you send us something today?

360
00:34:33,271 --> 00:34:35,273
I'm sorry, yes, you did say that.

361
00:34:35,306 --> 00:34:36,107
I'm sorry.

362
00:34:37,608 --> 00:34:41,512
Can, so I'll put you down for tomorrow, is that correct?

363
00:34:43,714 --> 00:34:44,515
Uh, yes.

364
00:34:46,484 --> 00:34:47,285
Uh-huh.

365
00:34:48,820 --> 00:34:50,955
So, did you say Thursday?

366
00:34:50,988 --> 00:34:51,989
Yeah, you did, right?

367
00:34:52,023 --> 00:34:53,024
Yeah, okay.

368
00:34:53,057 --> 00:34:54,759
Okay, sorry, Monday.

369
00:34:54,792 --> 00:34:56,127
Monday it is, then.

370
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,130
Thank you for being a valued customer.

371
00:35:00,231 --> 00:35:03,100
(phone ringing)

372
00:35:03,134 --> 00:35:06,037
(people talking)

373
00:35:40,571 --> 00:35:43,374
(phone vibrating)

374
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:12,970
(Jamaican music)

375
00:36:42,300 --> 00:36:44,268
- [Yenny] Hi, Daddy Brad.

376
00:36:44,302 --> 00:36:46,137
- Hi, beautiful boy.

377
00:36:48,339 --> 00:36:51,275
You know, all I could do today was think about seeing you,

378
00:36:51,309 --> 00:36:52,577
tonight.

379
00:36:52,610 --> 00:36:54,145
- Me, too.

380
00:36:54,178 --> 00:36:55,713
And thank you for the money.

381
00:36:55,746 --> 00:36:57,214
Especially the extra amount.

382
00:36:57,248 --> 00:36:58,716
- Of course.

383
00:36:58,749 --> 00:37:00,585
I wish it could be more.

384
00:37:00,618 --> 00:37:02,920
- I don't want your money, Daddy.

385
00:37:02,954 --> 00:37:05,256
I want to come live with you.

386
00:37:05,289 --> 00:37:09,260
I want to get out of here and live in New York City.

387
00:37:09,293 --> 00:37:12,396
And go to clubs, and go down the street,

388
00:37:12,430 --> 00:37:14,899
and hold your hand, and not be called batty boy,

389
00:37:14,932 --> 00:37:17,668
or get me face punched in.

390
00:37:17,702 --> 00:37:20,371
You have gay marriage now, right?

391
00:37:21,472 --> 00:37:23,307
I want to get married.

392
00:37:23,341 --> 00:37:25,109
Would you marry me?

393
00:37:26,644 --> 00:37:28,279
- Yes, I would.

394
00:37:28,312 --> 00:37:30,314
I would marry you.

395
00:37:30,348 --> 00:37:32,783
(chuckling)

396
00:37:34,719 --> 00:37:37,288
- I don't know what I'd do if I didn't have you.

397
00:37:37,321 --> 00:37:39,190
- Oh, you'd be fine.

398
00:37:39,223 --> 00:37:40,891
You made it this far.

399
00:37:42,660 --> 00:37:46,430
- Did I tell you I tried to kill meself last year?

400
00:37:46,464 --> 00:37:48,165
- No, you didn't.

401
00:37:48,199 --> 00:37:49,667
- Yes, well, I did.

402
00:37:52,236 --> 00:37:55,373
I was in the hospital for two months.

403
00:37:56,307 --> 00:37:57,608
- What happened?

404
00:37:57,642 --> 00:37:59,443
- Me sister was murdered.

405
00:37:59,477 --> 00:38:00,811
- Oh, my God.

406
00:38:00,845 --> 00:38:03,147
- She was murdered by a drug lord down here.

407
00:38:03,180 --> 00:38:04,949
He tried to burn her body.

408
00:38:04,982 --> 00:38:05,750
- I'm...

409
00:38:07,351 --> 00:38:08,319
I'm so sorry.

410
00:38:08,352 --> 00:38:09,153
I don't...

411
00:38:10,254 --> 00:38:12,123
I don't know what to say.

412
00:38:12,156 --> 00:38:15,693
- It's enough that you're here for me, Daddy.

413
00:38:15,726 --> 00:38:17,728
I have a reason to live now.

414
00:38:17,762 --> 00:38:18,996
I feel reborn.

415
00:38:19,830 --> 00:38:21,499
What about you?

416
00:38:21,532 --> 00:38:24,468
Have you ever lost someone?

417
00:38:24,502 --> 00:38:26,337
- Lost someone?

418
00:38:26,370 --> 00:38:29,206
- Are your parents still alive?

419
00:38:29,240 --> 00:38:30,408
- Yes, they are.

420
00:38:31,542 --> 00:38:34,278
- Oo, you're very lucky, Daddy.

421
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:36,447
- Yeah.

422
00:38:38,716 --> 00:38:40,518
- You seem sad, Daddy.

423
00:38:41,519 --> 00:38:42,853
- No, I'm good.

424
00:38:44,422 --> 00:38:46,257
- I wish I could reach through and give you

425
00:38:46,290 --> 00:38:48,359
a big hug and kiss.

426
00:38:48,392 --> 00:38:49,460
- Yeah, me too.

427
00:38:50,961 --> 00:38:53,731
- Like those old shows where a person could blink

428
00:38:53,764 --> 00:38:57,935
or wiggle their nose, and magically appear,

429
00:38:57,968 --> 00:39:00,471
and poof, I'd be right there,

430
00:39:02,073 --> 00:39:05,343
with my arms around you, holding you,

431
00:39:05,376 --> 00:39:07,445
kissing your handsome face.

432
00:39:09,213 --> 00:39:11,182
- I'd like that.

433
00:39:11,215 --> 00:39:13,350
- Would you let me sit on your lap?

434
00:39:13,384 --> 00:39:14,385
- Of course.

435
00:39:15,453 --> 00:39:16,654
- I like that.

436
00:39:17,922 --> 00:39:20,424
Sitting on your lap.

437
00:39:20,458 --> 00:39:23,427
My arms around you, kissing your lips.

438
00:39:24,762 --> 00:39:26,397
Would you let me cook for you, Daddy?

439
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:27,565
- Cook for me?

440
00:39:27,598 --> 00:39:30,568
- I just want to make you happy.

441
00:39:30,601 --> 00:39:32,903
I'd be waiting for you when you got home.

442
00:39:32,937 --> 00:39:36,540
Give you a massage, have dinner ready for you,

443
00:39:36,574 --> 00:39:38,776
kiss you, oh, not so fast.

444
00:39:40,444 --> 00:39:41,612
- What?

445
00:39:41,645 --> 00:39:43,447
- My surprise for you.

446
00:39:45,950 --> 00:39:50,154
When you got home, I'd be waiting for you like this.

447
00:39:53,190 --> 00:39:54,325
- Oh, my God.

448
00:39:56,927 --> 00:39:57,695
Oh, God.

449
00:40:03,601 --> 00:40:04,368
Oh, fuck.

450
00:40:09,507 --> 00:40:11,942
- I got these for you today.

451
00:40:12,777 --> 00:40:13,944
You like?

452
00:40:13,978 --> 00:40:15,546
- Yes, I like a lot.

453
00:40:18,482 --> 00:40:20,151
- Daddy getting hard?

454
00:40:26,490 --> 00:40:27,525
Daddy.

455
00:40:28,726 --> 00:40:30,661
It's just me, remember?

456
00:40:32,163 --> 00:40:32,963
- Yes.

457
00:40:34,165 --> 00:40:35,432
- Good.

458
00:40:35,466 --> 00:40:39,270
So, does Daddy's little Jamaican pussy boy wag your tail?

459
00:40:39,303 --> 00:40:40,070
- Yes.

460
00:40:41,572 --> 00:40:43,207
- Can you show me?

461
00:40:54,518 --> 00:40:56,620
It's so delicious looking.

462
00:40:56,654 --> 00:40:59,490
I can't wait to gobble it all up right now.

463
00:40:59,523 --> 00:41:01,492
- I want you to.

464
00:41:01,525 --> 00:41:04,061
Show me, show me your...

465
00:41:04,094 --> 00:41:05,663
- Si, Daddy Brad.

466
00:41:05,696 --> 00:41:08,499
- Show me your Jamaican boy pussy.

467
00:41:11,402 --> 00:41:12,503
- Hell, yeah.

468
00:41:19,009 --> 00:41:19,777
- Oh, God.

469
00:41:23,848 --> 00:41:24,815
- Do you like, Daddy?

470
00:41:24,849 --> 00:41:26,317
- Mm-Hmm.

471
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:27,117
- Yes.

472
00:41:28,719 --> 00:41:29,753
Do you want to see more, Daddy?

473
00:41:29,787 --> 00:41:31,555
- Yeah, yeah. Oh, God.

474
00:41:31,589 --> 00:41:34,024
- Daddy's so hard right now.

475
00:41:37,061 --> 00:41:37,862
- Oh, God.

476
00:41:39,897 --> 00:41:42,099
(moaning)

477
00:41:52,409 --> 00:41:54,879
(strange tone)

478
00:41:56,280 --> 00:41:57,515
- Are you okay, Daddy?

479
00:41:57,548 --> 00:42:00,584
- Uh-Huh, I just have to clean up.

480
00:42:04,255 --> 00:42:05,723
- That was hot, Daddy.

481
00:42:05,756 --> 00:42:08,726
Can we do it again, tomorrow?

482
00:42:08,759 --> 00:42:10,861
- Maybe. I don't know.

483
00:42:10,895 --> 00:42:12,363
We'll have to see, okay?

484
00:42:12,396 --> 00:42:13,530
- What's wrong?

485
00:42:13,564 --> 00:42:14,598
Do you still want me?

486
00:42:14,632 --> 00:42:16,100
- Yeah, of course I do.

487
00:42:16,133 --> 00:42:17,835
I just, I've never...

488
00:42:20,337 --> 00:42:22,873
We'll talk tomorrow, okay?

489
00:42:22,907 --> 00:42:25,376
- No, no, no, Daddy, I just got here.

490
00:42:25,409 --> 00:42:27,244
I have something important now, to ask you.

491
00:42:27,278 --> 00:42:28,612
- No, I have to go, Yenny.

492
00:42:28,646 --> 00:42:30,381
- No, no, no, no, no, just wait, Daddy, please, please.

493
00:42:30,414 --> 00:42:32,783
- I have to go, I'm sorry.

494
00:42:32,816 --> 00:42:35,319
(dark tones)

495
00:43:14,792 --> 00:43:17,661
(phone ringing)

496
00:43:17,695 --> 00:43:19,897
- Do you need to get that?

497
00:43:28,572 --> 00:43:32,810
- I wouldn't blame you, if you wanted to leave me.

498
00:43:33,811 --> 00:43:35,512
- We could just move.

499
00:43:36,981 --> 00:43:41,318
You know, we could just get away, and disappear.

500
00:43:41,352 --> 00:43:42,620
We could adopt.

501
00:43:42,653 --> 00:43:46,256
We could find someone who really needs us.

502
00:43:53,097 --> 00:43:53,897
Yeah?

503
00:43:54,765 --> 00:43:55,733
Yeah.

504
00:43:55,766 --> 00:43:58,202
(chuckling)

505
00:44:27,031 --> 00:44:28,999
- I hope that I've not upset you,

506
00:44:29,033 --> 00:44:32,336
with anything I've done, or said to you.

507
00:44:32,369 --> 00:44:34,038
You mean so much to me.

508
00:44:34,071 --> 00:44:35,839
You're the first white man to ever tell me

509
00:44:35,873 --> 00:44:37,107
that you love me.

510
00:44:38,609 --> 00:44:41,745
You're so generous and handsome, and,

511
00:44:43,047 --> 00:44:44,415
I want nothing more than to come to New York City,

512
00:44:44,448 --> 00:44:46,417
and live with you.

513
00:44:46,450 --> 00:44:49,653
And be your little Jamaican pussy boy.

514
00:44:52,923 --> 00:44:55,259
I need a daddy to take care of me.

515
00:44:55,292 --> 00:44:56,226
I need you.

516
00:45:00,230 --> 00:45:01,865
Please, Daddy Brad.

517
00:45:01,899 --> 00:45:03,967
Please, come take me away from this place.

518
00:45:04,001 --> 00:45:06,437
Please, Daddy Brad, save me.

519
00:45:33,664 --> 00:45:37,501
- I forgot to tell you, I may be going on a trip.

520
00:45:37,534 --> 00:45:38,969
- Really? Where?

521
00:45:42,773 --> 00:45:45,542
- I may be gone for several weeks.

522
00:47:09,960 --> 00:47:11,595
- Yay! Daddy Brad.

523
00:47:11,628 --> 00:47:12,930
- Hi, Yenny.

524
00:47:12,963 --> 00:47:16,066
- Hold on, I want to show you something.

525
00:47:20,037 --> 00:47:21,572
You like?

526
00:47:21,605 --> 00:47:22,406
- Sure.

527
00:47:23,574 --> 00:47:25,042
- I knew you would.

528
00:47:26,810 --> 00:47:27,778
You okay?

529
00:47:27,811 --> 00:47:29,446
You seem tired.

530
00:47:29,479 --> 00:47:30,280
- I do?

531
00:47:31,114 --> 00:47:33,717
- You need to get sleep.

532
00:47:33,750 --> 00:47:34,551
- Okay.

533
00:47:35,485 --> 00:47:36,920
- Okay, then.

534
00:47:36,954 --> 00:47:38,422
Did you get my message last night?

535
00:47:38,455 --> 00:47:39,623
- Yes, I did.

536
00:47:39,656 --> 00:47:41,058
It was very sweet.

537
00:47:42,826 --> 00:47:44,494
- I meant every word.

538
00:47:45,729 --> 00:47:46,496
So...

539
00:47:48,732 --> 00:47:49,967
- So...

540
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,903
- I need to ask you for something.

541
00:47:52,936 --> 00:47:57,107
I have business opportunity that I think would have me

542
00:47:57,140 --> 00:47:59,643
get, man, so I can get me visa,

543
00:47:59,676 --> 00:48:01,211
and come live with you.

544
00:48:01,245 --> 00:48:03,881
I want to raise rabbits for their fur.

545
00:48:03,914 --> 00:48:06,783
I used to do this, and I know that I can quickly get

546
00:48:06,817 --> 00:48:09,786
the money I need, but I need some help to get started.

547
00:48:09,820 --> 00:48:11,321
- How much do you need?

548
00:48:11,355 --> 00:48:13,156
- I need about 200 US.

549
00:48:15,192 --> 00:48:16,460
- 200.

550
00:48:16,493 --> 00:48:17,294
- Yeah.

551
00:48:18,662 --> 00:48:19,997
- For rabbits.

552
00:48:20,030 --> 00:48:22,899
- To build a hot old bath for 'em,

553
00:48:22,933 --> 00:48:26,003
to buy food for several months, till they're grown,

554
00:48:26,036 --> 00:48:28,272
and then, to bye the babies.

555
00:48:28,305 --> 00:48:29,906
- 200.

556
00:48:29,940 --> 00:48:31,275
- Yes, Daddy Brad.

557
00:48:31,308 --> 00:48:33,944
I know that it's a lot, but, it'll help me achieve

558
00:48:33,977 --> 00:48:35,112
what I need to.

559
00:48:35,145 --> 00:48:36,847
- No, I understand.

560
00:48:38,015 --> 00:48:39,816
- So, can you help me?

561
00:48:42,319 --> 00:48:44,121
- Yenny, baby boy, um.

562
00:48:47,157 --> 00:48:48,458
I'm a little...

563
00:48:51,295 --> 00:48:54,798
Concerned that you're only talking to me,

564
00:48:57,834 --> 00:49:00,937
because you think I can give you money.

565
00:49:00,971 --> 00:49:01,838
No. No, no.

566
00:49:02,806 --> 00:49:03,941
- No, no, here me out.

567
00:49:03,974 --> 00:49:05,208
I think you're amazing.

568
00:49:05,242 --> 00:49:09,346
I think you're so sweet, and, you seem so honest,

569
00:49:12,416 --> 00:49:16,653
but I just don't, I don't want there to be a pattern,

570
00:49:18,155 --> 00:49:21,158
where you only come to me for money.

571
00:49:23,560 --> 00:49:25,228
Does that make sense?

572
00:49:28,932 --> 00:49:32,803
- Can you help me with anything, then?

573
00:49:32,836 --> 00:49:36,673
- Well, Yenny, I want to help you, but I,

574
00:49:36,707 --> 00:49:38,642
I just can't right now.

575
00:49:38,675 --> 00:49:41,745
- So, you don't really love me, then.

576
00:49:43,180 --> 00:49:44,481
- Yenny.

577
00:49:44,514 --> 00:49:46,917
- Because I know that $200 can't be so much money

578
00:49:46,950 --> 00:49:47,751
for you.

579
00:49:49,052 --> 00:49:51,588
You are a rich financier and you live in New York City.

580
00:49:51,621 --> 00:49:53,390
- Yenny, baby boy.

581
00:49:53,423 --> 00:49:55,826
- I will pay you back, every penny.

582
00:49:55,859 --> 00:49:58,195
- And I believe you, Yenny.

583
00:49:59,096 --> 00:50:00,364
It's just that...

584
00:50:05,369 --> 00:50:07,070
Oh, Yenny, baby.

585
00:50:07,104 --> 00:50:08,505
Please don't cry.

586
00:50:08,538 --> 00:50:09,773
- I'm not your baby.

587
00:50:09,806 --> 00:50:11,541
I'm your fucking toy.

588
00:50:12,943 --> 00:50:14,111
- Yenny, please.

589
00:50:14,144 --> 00:50:15,812
- Please, what? What?

590
00:50:20,417 --> 00:50:21,485
Please, what?

591
00:50:23,120 --> 00:50:27,357
I know my feelings are crazy, but look at where I am?

592
00:50:27,391 --> 00:50:29,760
Do you understand how hard every minute

593
00:50:29,793 --> 00:50:31,962
of every day is for me, here?

594
00:50:31,995 --> 00:50:32,796
Do you?

595
00:50:38,635 --> 00:50:40,370
I bet you I'd save four grand to everything

596
00:50:40,404 --> 00:50:43,940
you ever owned in your whole life.

597
00:50:43,974 --> 00:50:45,075
Here, I have nothing.

598
00:50:45,108 --> 00:50:49,246
I have no one, I have no job, I have no family.

599
00:50:50,447 --> 00:50:53,383
And the only person I thought I truly had is you.

600
00:50:53,417 --> 00:50:55,051
- You still have me.

601
00:50:55,085 --> 00:50:58,388
- And to think I wanted you to bring me raw.

602
00:50:58,422 --> 00:51:00,490
I would let any man do that.

603
00:51:00,524 --> 00:51:02,592
- I'll still come and visit you.

604
00:51:02,626 --> 00:51:04,127
- Sure, you will.

605
00:51:05,695 --> 00:51:08,198
I thought you were different.

606
00:51:10,500 --> 00:51:11,301
Well...

607
00:51:13,503 --> 00:51:14,304
Okay.

608
00:51:15,439 --> 00:51:17,507
Goodbye, Daddy, that's what you want.

609
00:51:17,541 --> 00:51:19,576
And don't call me, or text me,

610
00:51:19,609 --> 00:51:22,312
or hit me up online ever again.

611
00:51:28,985 --> 00:51:29,886
- Fuck! No!

612
00:51:31,221 --> 00:51:32,656
Goddammit! Fuck!

613
00:51:35,325 --> 00:51:37,561
(tense aura)

614
00:51:46,203 --> 00:51:48,171
- Everything okay? - What?

615
00:51:49,372 --> 00:51:51,441
- I heard you-- - What did you hear?

616
00:51:51,475 --> 00:51:53,743
What the fuck did you hear?

617
00:52:00,317 --> 00:52:02,319
- What's going on, Brad?

618
00:52:09,226 --> 00:52:10,360
Hey, I'm...

619
00:52:12,729 --> 00:52:14,698
I'm gonna start dinner, okay?

620
00:52:14,731 --> 00:52:15,532
Just...

621
00:53:42,752 --> 00:53:44,754
- No, ma'am, I'm afraid you're not getting it.

622
00:53:44,788 --> 00:53:48,625
If we don't get your payment now, like right now,

623
00:53:48,658 --> 00:53:52,128
if we don't get your minimum payment that's been due,

624
00:53:52,162 --> 00:53:53,763
right now, we will have to send your account

625
00:53:53,797 --> 00:53:56,333
to a collection agency.

626
00:53:56,366 --> 00:54:00,170
I'm afraid, I'm sorry that I don't understand.

627
00:54:01,338 --> 00:54:04,007
Yeah, I'm aware that you have a lot of things

628
00:54:04,040 --> 00:54:06,242
going on in your life, that you have a lot of problems.

629
00:54:06,276 --> 00:54:07,744
Well, guess what, ma'am?

630
00:54:07,777 --> 00:54:10,013
We all have a lot of shit in our lives.

631
00:54:10,046 --> 00:54:14,017
We all have problems, and shit that piles up,

632
00:54:14,050 --> 00:54:16,519
and that makes us not want to do anything,

633
00:54:16,553 --> 00:54:20,457
but we still have to all pay our fucking bills!

634
00:54:21,858 --> 00:54:24,561
(people talking)

635
00:54:25,729 --> 00:54:29,532
I'm sorry, ma'am, yes, you were saying.

636
00:54:29,566 --> 00:54:30,867
Yes, tomorrow will be fine.

637
00:54:30,900 --> 00:54:34,904
Thank you very much for being a valued customer.

638
00:54:36,973 --> 00:54:39,542
(phone ringing)

639
00:54:55,158 --> 00:54:56,226
You gonna cum?

640
00:54:56,259 --> 00:54:57,494
You gonna cum?

641
00:54:58,528 --> 00:55:00,497
(moaning)

642
00:55:22,085 --> 00:55:24,454
- That was so hot, Daddy Brad.

643
00:55:29,559 --> 00:55:30,727
Thank you for the help.

644
00:55:30,760 --> 00:55:32,295
I knew you would.

645
00:55:33,563 --> 00:55:34,731
- You promise you're gonna use the money the way

646
00:55:34,764 --> 00:55:35,932
you said you would?

647
00:55:35,965 --> 00:55:37,567
- I already have.

648
00:55:37,600 --> 00:55:38,401
Hold on.

649
00:55:41,938 --> 00:55:44,374
Daddy Brad, meet Buddy Brad.

650
00:55:46,476 --> 00:55:47,777
(chuckling)

651
00:55:47,811 --> 00:55:49,412
- Oh, I was afraid that you were only talking to me

652
00:55:49,446 --> 00:55:50,513
for the money.

653
00:55:50,547 --> 00:55:53,516
- Oh, please, don't ever think that.

654
00:55:53,550 --> 00:55:56,119
- Well, you didn't text me all day.

655
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:58,121
- I couldn't, honest.

656
00:55:58,154 --> 00:56:01,357
I was mad at you yesterday, not today.

657
00:56:01,391 --> 00:56:03,660
People get mad, it happens.

658
00:56:05,261 --> 00:56:06,062
I'm sorry.

659
00:56:07,230 --> 00:56:09,432
Now, I feel horrible, Daddy Brad.

660
00:56:09,466 --> 00:56:11,067
I would never hurt my man.

661
00:56:11,101 --> 00:56:11,968
I love you.

662
00:56:12,902 --> 00:56:14,604
- I want to believe that.

663
00:56:14,637 --> 00:56:16,239
- I do.

664
00:56:16,272 --> 00:56:18,475
You've helped me out so much.

665
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:21,377
No one here ever does anything for me.

666
00:56:21,411 --> 00:56:23,980
No one ever talks to me the way you do.

667
00:56:24,013 --> 00:56:26,750
- Well, I like you, Yenny.

668
00:56:26,783 --> 00:56:28,384
I want to be there for you.

669
00:56:28,418 --> 00:56:30,453
- You are here for me.

670
00:56:34,090 --> 00:56:36,593
- Would you really come here to live with me?

671
00:56:36,626 --> 00:56:38,595
- In a second, if I could.

672
00:56:45,301 --> 00:56:46,202
Daddy Brad.

673
00:56:47,036 --> 00:56:48,404
- Yeah.

674
00:56:48,438 --> 00:56:51,107
- I've been wondering this for a while, now.

675
00:56:51,141 --> 00:56:52,442
- Wondering what?

676
00:56:53,676 --> 00:56:56,713
- Who is that in the picture behind you?

677
00:56:57,614 --> 00:56:59,349
- You can see that?

678
00:57:01,351 --> 00:57:04,354
(tempered piano)

679
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,589
Benjamin, that's Benjamin.

680
00:57:06,623 --> 00:57:07,624
- Who is he?

681
00:57:09,325 --> 00:57:10,493
- That's my son.

682
00:57:11,661 --> 00:57:13,730
- You really are a daddy.

683
00:57:14,731 --> 00:57:15,532
- Yes.

684
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:18,468
- Where is he?

685
00:57:18,501 --> 00:57:20,770
Does he live with his mother?

686
00:57:20,804 --> 00:57:23,807
- He doesn't live with anyone anymore.

687
00:57:23,840 --> 00:57:24,641
He...

688
00:57:28,645 --> 00:57:30,113
Benjamin's dead.

689
00:57:30,146 --> 00:57:32,549
He... there was an accident.

690
00:57:34,184 --> 00:57:36,052
He was swimming, and...

691
00:57:37,887 --> 00:57:41,891
Something happened, and he drowned, and he died.

692
00:57:44,594 --> 00:57:45,895
- You were there?

693
00:57:47,096 --> 00:57:50,700
- No, I was not there, but I should have been.

694
00:57:54,504 --> 00:57:56,539
- I am so sorry, Brad.

695
00:57:59,676 --> 00:58:00,743
- Yeah, me too.

696
00:58:03,513 --> 00:58:06,850
- Do you want me to stop calling you "daddy?"

697
00:58:06,883 --> 00:58:08,618
I will if you want.

698
00:58:11,120 --> 00:58:12,589
- No, please don't.

699
00:58:18,061 --> 00:58:20,530
- I swear on me mother's grave,

700
00:58:20,563 --> 00:58:23,433
I won't ask you for any more money.

701
00:58:24,734 --> 00:58:26,536
I just want you, Daddy Brad.

702
00:58:26,569 --> 00:58:28,738
I want to be all yours.

703
00:58:29,973 --> 00:58:31,608
I think we both have pain, and we can both

704
00:58:31,641 --> 00:58:32,675
help each other.

705
00:58:32,709 --> 00:58:33,476
I know it.

706
00:58:35,545 --> 00:58:37,547
- You're so sweet.

707
00:58:37,580 --> 00:58:38,548
- No, you are.

708
00:58:44,954 --> 00:58:47,590
Can I ask you something else?

709
00:58:47,624 --> 00:58:48,925
- Sure.

710
00:58:48,958 --> 00:58:50,460
- And you don't have to answer this.

711
00:58:50,493 --> 00:58:51,594
- No, it's fine.

712
00:58:53,730 --> 00:58:55,732
- Are you still married?

713
00:58:57,133 --> 00:58:57,934
- No.

714
00:59:03,840 --> 00:59:05,608
- Because it would be okay, if you were.

715
00:59:05,642 --> 00:59:08,478
I don't think I would mind.

716
00:59:08,511 --> 00:59:11,581
Most gay men in Jamaica are married.

717
00:59:11,614 --> 00:59:13,383
- I bet that causes a lot of problems.

718
00:59:13,416 --> 00:59:15,618
- It solves a lot of them.

719
00:59:19,689 --> 00:59:23,927
♪ We'll get our breakfast from the trees

720
00:59:26,362 --> 00:59:30,600
♪ We'll get our honey from the bees

721
00:59:32,368 --> 00:59:36,606
♪ We'll take around on the water park

722
00:59:38,274 --> 00:59:42,478

♪ And we'll live together, in our dreamland, and be

00:59:53,356 --> 00:59:55,725
♪ Forever one

725
01:00:10,573 --> 01:00:12,275
- Yeah, so...

726
01:00:12,308 --> 01:00:15,878
What kind of an increase can I get?

727
01:00:15,912 --> 01:00:17,146
I see, well...

728
01:00:18,247 --> 01:00:20,650
Could that be more like 5,000?

729
01:00:21,851 --> 01:00:25,355
No, um, you see, I've been a good customer

730
01:00:26,322 --> 01:00:28,825
for about ten years now, and...

731
01:00:30,360 --> 01:00:32,829
I would hate to transfer my balance to another card,

732
01:00:32,862 --> 01:00:33,663
you know?

733
01:00:35,865 --> 01:00:37,033
Sure, I'll hold.

734
01:00:39,669 --> 01:00:40,570
Uh, yes, ma'am.

735
01:00:40,603 --> 01:00:43,039
I completely understand.

736
01:00:43,072 --> 01:00:46,009
Yes, that's totally understandable,

737
01:00:47,243 --> 01:00:49,679
but we were wondering when we could expect

738
01:00:49,712 --> 01:00:51,914
the minimum payment from you.

739
01:00:51,948 --> 01:00:55,685
No, you see, because you are delinquent on your account,

740
01:00:55,718 --> 01:00:58,755
it would be in your best interest,

741
01:00:59,956 --> 01:01:03,826
if you could get it sooner, rather than later.

742
01:01:03,860 --> 01:01:04,627
Uh-huh.

743
01:01:06,763 --> 01:01:07,797
Uh-huh.

744
01:01:09,298 --> 01:01:12,668
No, that's great, so could it possibly be Tuesday,

745
01:01:12,702 --> 01:01:14,737
rather than Wednesday?

746
01:01:15,972 --> 01:01:18,975
Tuesday would be ideal for us, yeah.

747
01:01:19,876 --> 01:01:20,877
Tuesday.

748
01:01:23,913 --> 01:01:25,214
Uh-huh. No, no.

749
01:01:27,817 --> 01:01:29,419
Uh-huh. Great, okay.

750
01:01:30,386 --> 01:01:31,154
Great.

751
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:38,094
I, okay, great, so I'm going to put you down, here,

752
01:01:38,127 --> 01:01:41,297
in my notes, for this coming Tuesday,

753
01:01:41,330 --> 01:01:43,433
for your minimum payment.

754
01:01:47,170 --> 01:01:51,307
Great, thank you so much for being a valued customer.

755
01:01:52,275 --> 01:01:54,310
(phone ringing)

756
01:01:54,343 --> 01:01:57,080
(people talking)

757
01:02:45,995 --> 01:02:47,597
- Oh my God, Daddy Brad.

758
01:02:47,630 --> 01:02:49,298
- Hi, baby boy.

759
01:02:49,332 --> 01:02:51,501
- I feel bad about what you did.

760
01:02:51,534 --> 01:02:53,503
You didn't need to do that.

761
01:02:53,536 --> 01:02:54,670
- Well--

762
01:02:54,704 --> 01:02:55,938
- How can I ever thank you?

763
01:02:55,972 --> 01:02:57,173
- You didn't seem so excited to see me, so...

764
01:02:57,206 --> 01:02:58,975
- No, no, no, I am.

765
01:03:00,877 --> 01:03:04,147
So, when were you planning on coming down?

766
01:03:04,180 --> 01:03:05,815
- In two weeks.

767
01:03:05,848 --> 01:03:07,884
I haven't bought my airfare yet, though.

768
01:03:07,917 --> 01:03:10,052
- Where will you be staying?

769
01:03:10,086 --> 01:03:12,788
- Well, I don't know, yet.

770
01:03:12,822 --> 01:03:16,159
I was thinking about renting a place, maybe.

771
01:03:16,192 --> 01:03:18,828
- Sweet, so I could come stay with you.

772
01:03:18,861 --> 01:03:20,229
- That's the idea.

773
01:03:22,598 --> 01:03:24,200
- I got something new for you today.

774
01:03:24,233 --> 01:03:25,668
Wanna see?

775
01:03:25,701 --> 01:03:26,869
- You know I do.

776
01:03:31,274 --> 01:03:32,708
- I'll show you.

777
01:03:36,012 --> 01:03:37,046
- Yeah.

778
01:03:43,519 --> 01:03:44,587
- You like?

779
01:03:44,620 --> 01:03:45,421
- Yeah.

780
01:03:48,724 --> 01:03:49,859
- May I ask you something?

781
01:03:49,892 --> 01:03:50,860
- Yeah.

782
01:03:52,028 --> 01:03:54,263
- Will you fuck me every day?

783
01:03:56,232 --> 01:03:57,900
- Every day, all day.

784
01:04:00,436 --> 01:04:04,073
- May I see that big fat white daddy dick?

785
01:04:04,907 --> 01:04:07,176
- It's your daddy dick.

786
01:04:07,210 --> 01:04:10,379
Can I see your tight Jamaican boy pussy?

787
01:04:10,413 --> 01:04:12,215
- Any time you want, Daddy.

788
01:04:12,248 --> 01:04:14,016
It's your Jamaican boy pussy.

789
01:04:14,050 --> 01:04:15,785
- What the fuck?

790
01:04:15,818 --> 01:04:17,053
(screaming)

791
01:04:17,086 --> 01:04:19,021
- What the fuck?

792
01:04:19,055 --> 01:04:20,556
Yenny!

793
01:04:20,590 --> 01:04:21,958
- Listen to me, you white American cocksucker.

794
01:04:21,991 --> 01:04:24,060
If I ever hear you talk to my nephew again,

795
01:04:24,093 --> 01:04:25,795
if I ever see you on this island,

796
01:04:25,828 --> 01:04:29,065
I will cut your balls out with me own fucking hands,

797
01:04:29,098 --> 01:04:30,466
shove them down into you,

798
01:04:30,499 --> 01:04:32,068
and pull them out of your butt, you hear me?

799
01:04:32,101 --> 01:04:33,869
If you ever so much as text him again,

800
01:04:33,903 --> 01:04:35,738
I'll beat the Jesus out of him, so you hear me?

801
01:04:35,771 --> 01:04:37,807
You filthy piece of fuck, you.

802
01:04:37,840 --> 01:04:39,041
He wants you.

803
01:04:39,075 --> 01:04:39,842
- Yenny!

804
01:04:44,080 --> 01:04:44,981
Oh, my God.

805
01:04:45,815 --> 01:04:46,882
What the fuck? What the fuck?

806
01:04:46,916 --> 01:04:49,118
What the fuck? Oh, my God.

807
01:04:57,260 --> 01:04:58,027
Oh, no.

808
01:05:01,964 --> 01:05:02,765
Come on.

809
01:05:11,040 --> 01:05:12,308
Come on.

810
01:05:12,341 --> 01:05:14,410
Hi, I'd like to report a crime.

811
01:05:14,443 --> 01:05:17,847
I need for someone to, uh, I don't know.

812
01:05:20,216 --> 01:05:22,785
Schenectady, New York. Hello.

813
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:32,995
(tense aura)

814
01:05:45,975 --> 01:05:47,443
- Bradley.

815
01:05:47,476 --> 01:05:49,445
- Huh? He's fine.

816
01:05:49,478 --> 01:05:50,646
- Who's fine?

817
01:05:50,680 --> 01:05:51,414
- What?

818
01:05:53,516 --> 01:05:54,317
I'm fine.

819
01:05:55,318 --> 01:05:57,086
- You don't look fine.

820
01:05:59,522 --> 01:06:02,091
- I think I'm a little nauseous.

821
01:06:43,065 --> 01:06:45,868
So, I'll put you for tomorrow, then,

822
01:06:45,901 --> 01:06:47,370
instead of Tuesday?

823
01:06:49,305 --> 01:06:51,774
Tomorrow, instead of Tuesday.

824
01:06:54,276 --> 01:06:56,212
Tomorrow, or Tuesday?

825
01:06:58,614 --> 01:07:00,116
Tuesday, Tuesday.

826
01:07:40,256 --> 01:07:42,825
Hi, is this Mr. Robert Burowski?

827
01:07:44,193 --> 01:07:45,261
How are you today?

828
01:07:45,294 --> 01:07:46,829
Oh, that's wonderful. Yes.

829
01:07:46,862 --> 01:07:49,432
Well, I'm calling about your World Bank credit card.

830
01:07:49,465 --> 01:07:52,802
I believe you have the platinum premium.

831
01:07:54,036 --> 01:07:56,071
Yes, well, see, our records indicate

832
01:07:56,105 --> 01:08:00,342
that you are over a week late on your account,

833
01:08:00,376 --> 01:08:01,977
and we were wondering when we could expect

834
01:08:02,011 --> 01:08:03,612
the minimum payment.

835
01:08:06,015 --> 01:08:06,816
Uh-huh.

836
01:08:08,517 --> 01:08:09,652
Uh-huh, okay.

837
01:08:11,887 --> 01:08:13,289
Yeah, that's fine.

838
01:08:17,560 --> 01:08:21,797
Yes, thank you very much, for being a valued customer.

839
01:08:23,299 --> 01:08:24,967
And, what's the cost?

840
01:08:27,203 --> 01:08:29,205
There's nothing cheaper?

841
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:35,878
And, this is nine o'clock, tomorrow morning?

842
01:08:37,580 --> 01:08:41,150
And, what time does it get into Kingston?

843
01:08:43,819 --> 01:08:44,587
Okay.

844
01:08:46,689 --> 01:08:48,023
Yeah.

845
01:08:48,057 --> 01:08:49,892
My card number is...

846
01:08:49,925 --> 01:08:51,160
- So, today's it?

847
01:08:52,394 --> 01:08:55,464
- Yes, I'm afraid that today is it.

848
01:08:55,498 --> 01:08:59,134
See, I got offered this amazing job.

849
01:08:59,168 --> 01:09:02,404
Did I ever tell you that I was a physician?

850
01:09:02,438 --> 01:09:03,405
Yeah, I was a doctor.

851
01:09:03,439 --> 01:09:05,908
Still am, really, and,

852
01:09:05,941 --> 01:09:08,310
there is this place that wants me to come down,

853
01:09:08,344 --> 01:09:09,945
and work for them.

854
01:09:11,380 --> 01:09:12,348
It's a clinic.

855
01:09:13,249 --> 01:09:15,484
- You'll have to fill these out.

856
01:09:15,518 --> 01:09:16,819
- Of course.

857
01:09:16,852 --> 01:09:18,354
- And make sure your desk is cleaned out,

858
01:09:18,387 --> 01:09:19,688
before you leave.

859
01:09:20,623 --> 01:09:22,525
- They rescue them.

860
01:09:22,558 --> 01:09:23,359
- What?

861
01:09:26,762 --> 01:09:29,632
- The clinic, they rescue the kids.

862
01:09:33,536 --> 01:09:37,439
- I thought you said your trip was in a few weeks.

863
01:09:37,473 --> 01:09:38,574
- It changed.

864
01:09:40,543 --> 01:09:41,443
- Tomorrow.

865
01:09:43,412 --> 01:09:44,213
- Yeah.

866
01:09:45,314 --> 01:09:47,950
- It just, it seems so sudden.

867
01:10:14,176 --> 01:10:16,078
(wind)

868
01:10:51,380 --> 01:10:52,181
- Brad.

869
01:10:54,283 --> 01:10:55,050
Come here.

870
01:10:56,518 --> 01:10:57,319
Come here.

871
01:11:08,130 --> 01:11:11,467
I just wanted to say this before you left.

872
01:11:11,500 --> 01:11:14,136
Before you leave on your trip.

873
01:11:17,806 --> 01:11:21,510
Wherever you go, wherever you're going, or,

874
01:11:22,745 --> 01:11:26,749
whatever you have to do, like, I'm okay with it.

875
01:11:29,351 --> 01:11:30,152
I am.

876
01:12:12,428 --> 01:12:15,397
(Jamaican music)

877
01:14:42,377 --> 01:14:44,913
- [Brad Voiceover] My dearest Marsha,

878
01:14:44,947 --> 01:14:46,181
you were responsible

879
01:14:46,215 --> 01:14:49,384
for the two happiest days of my life.

880
01:14:49,418 --> 01:14:51,587
The day we got married, and the day you gave birth

881
01:14:51,620 --> 01:14:52,554
to our son.

882
01:14:53,555 --> 01:14:56,291
(tender piano)

883
01:15:01,296 --> 01:15:04,333
Conversely, I am the one responsible for everything else bad

884
01:15:04,366 --> 01:15:06,368
that has happened to us.

885
01:15:10,606 --> 01:15:12,808
For that, I'm truly sorry.

886
01:15:15,978 --> 01:15:18,614
And I'm sorry for blaming you.

887
01:15:22,551 --> 01:15:25,487
(birds chirping)

888
01:15:41,603 --> 01:15:45,641
By now, you probably know what I'm up to.

889
01:15:45,674 --> 01:15:47,776
I'm sorry I couldn't tell you about what was going on,

890
01:15:47,809 --> 01:15:48,944
face to face.

891
01:16:03,759 --> 01:16:08,297
I sort of knew before the accident what was going on,

892
01:16:08,330 --> 01:16:09,131
in me.

893
01:16:10,799 --> 01:16:14,670
I couldn't figure out how to tell you, and then,

894
01:16:14,703 --> 01:16:18,941
after what happened to Benjamin, I couldn't tell you.

895
01:16:23,712 --> 01:16:27,182
Trying to start over, to remake my past,

896
01:16:27,215 --> 01:16:31,453
to show someone love, and give them a chance at a new life.

897
01:16:32,621 --> 01:16:34,556
I know I can do that.

898
01:16:35,524 --> 01:16:36,391
Love, Brad.

899
01:17:52,300 --> 01:17:54,970
(Jamaican music)

900
01:18:50,292 --> 01:18:53,028
(orchestra music)

901
01:19:24,826 --> 01:19:27,129
(knocking)

902
01:19:30,398 --> 01:19:32,300
- One second, man. Hey.

903
01:19:34,002 --> 01:19:35,537
- That's right.

904
01:19:35,570 --> 01:19:36,538
Where is he?

905
01:19:36,571 --> 01:19:37,606
- Don't shoot, man. Don't shoot.

906
01:19:37,639 --> 01:19:38,607
We don't mean no harm.

907
01:19:38,640 --> 01:19:39,708
- Where is Yenny?

908
01:19:39,741 --> 01:19:40,809
Yenny!

909
01:19:40,842 --> 01:19:42,043
- You're the guy from (mumbling) ain't you?

910
01:19:42,077 --> 01:19:43,678
- Where is Yenny?

911
01:19:43,712 --> 01:19:44,880
If you have laid a finger on him, I swear to God,

912
01:19:44,913 --> 01:19:46,047
I will fucking kill you.

913
01:19:46,081 --> 01:19:47,048
Do you hear me?

914
01:19:47,082 --> 01:19:48,049
I will fucking kill you.

915
01:19:48,083 --> 01:19:48,884
Yenny!

916
01:19:50,819 --> 01:19:52,020
- What are you doing here?

917
01:19:52,053 --> 01:19:53,288
- I came here, like I said I would,

918
01:19:53,321 --> 01:19:54,823
to take you away from all this shit,

919
01:19:54,856 --> 01:19:57,959
so get your things, pack up your things.

920
01:19:57,993 --> 01:19:59,694
I have a place, you'll be safe there.

921
01:19:59,728 --> 01:20:03,298
- Bradley, you need to put down that gun, right now.

922
01:20:03,331 --> 01:20:04,299
- Who's that child?

923
01:20:04,332 --> 01:20:05,834
What is she doing here?

924
01:20:05,867 --> 01:20:07,903
- That's me daughter, Shelia.

925
01:20:07,936 --> 01:20:09,337
That is our daughter.

926
01:20:09,371 --> 01:20:10,572
- Please put the gun down now.

927
01:20:10,605 --> 01:20:11,940
Please. - What?

928
01:20:13,441 --> 01:20:14,843
Your child? What?

929
01:20:14,876 --> 01:20:16,077
Who is this man?

930
01:20:16,111 --> 01:20:17,846
- This is Demetri.

931
01:20:17,879 --> 01:20:19,281
He's my husband.

932
01:20:22,384 --> 01:20:23,185
- What?

933
01:20:24,586 --> 01:20:28,657
But I saw him, I saw him kick you in the face!

934
01:20:28,690 --> 01:20:30,926
- You thought you saw those things, Bradley.

935
01:20:30,959 --> 01:20:32,060
- Your fucking husband?

936
01:20:32,093 --> 01:20:33,995
- Love Yenny.

937
01:20:34,029 --> 01:20:35,030
I'd never hurt him.

938
01:20:35,063 --> 01:20:38,200
I love him like how I love Sheliana.

939
01:20:38,233 --> 01:20:39,834
- The fuck?

940
01:20:39,868 --> 01:20:40,936
You're making him say those things, aren't you?

941
01:20:40,969 --> 01:20:42,170
He's making you say those things, right?

942
01:20:42,204 --> 01:20:44,172
- Bradley, stop!

943
01:20:44,206 --> 01:20:46,441
You need to take a breath.

944
01:20:46,474 --> 01:20:48,043
Please. For me.

945
01:20:48,076 --> 01:20:48,877
- So...

946
01:20:50,312 --> 01:20:52,247
Everything you said to me was a lie.

947
01:20:52,280 --> 01:20:53,548
- No, Bradley.

948
01:20:53,582 --> 01:20:55,917
No, I told you many true things about me.

949
01:20:55,951 --> 01:20:58,453
Even about how I was feeling.

950
01:20:58,486 --> 01:20:59,621
- How you were feeling?

951
01:20:59,654 --> 01:21:02,057
- Me sister really was murdered.

952
01:21:02,090 --> 01:21:04,559
I really was kicked out of me house.

953
01:21:04,593 --> 01:21:06,294
All of that happened.

954
01:21:06,328 --> 01:21:08,063
- But what about?

955
01:21:08,096 --> 01:21:09,731
What about the money I gave you?

956
01:21:09,764 --> 01:21:10,966
What'd you do with that?

957
01:21:10,999 --> 01:21:12,267
- It was not much money to you, Bradley.

958
01:21:12,300 --> 01:21:15,704
Not to a rich, white American, living in New York City,

959
01:21:15,737 --> 01:21:17,906
who travels back and forth to Jamaica.

960
01:21:17,939 --> 01:21:20,041
- I gave you a fucking thousand dollars.

961
01:21:20,075 --> 01:21:22,777
- I never ask you for that.

962
01:21:22,811 --> 01:21:24,012
You know that?

963
01:21:26,915 --> 01:21:28,483
Bradley, look at me.

964
01:21:29,851 --> 01:21:31,453
Look at me, Bradley.

965
01:21:33,088 --> 01:21:35,824
Please, put the gun down, okay?

966
01:21:48,536 --> 01:21:53,308
- [Demetri] I'll show you what we do with the money.

967
01:21:53,341 --> 01:21:55,076
- You grow pot with him?

968
01:21:55,110 --> 01:21:56,011
You sell pot?

969
01:21:56,044 --> 01:21:57,078
Is that what you do?

970
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,614
- No, formulas, for the baby.

971
01:22:01,983 --> 01:22:04,886
- I'm sorry I lied to you, Bradley,

972
01:22:06,054 --> 01:22:08,156
but me daughter needs to live.

973
01:22:08,189 --> 01:22:10,959
She needs food, and medication.

974
01:22:12,527 --> 01:22:15,130
- You helped us out greatly, Brad.

975
01:22:15,163 --> 01:22:15,964
Thank you.

976
01:22:17,732 --> 01:22:20,869
- Bradley, we not spend a thousand dollars.

977
01:22:20,902 --> 01:22:22,804
You can have that back.

978
01:22:26,641 --> 01:22:29,077
(tender piano)

979
01:23:08,183 --> 01:23:09,050
- Benjamin!

980
01:23:09,918 --> 01:23:12,620
(birds chirping)

981
01:24:48,316 --> 01:24:51,152
(acoustic guitar)
