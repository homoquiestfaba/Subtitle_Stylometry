00:02:28,448 --> 00:02:30,189

Hey, man, you tripping, man
Let my hand-- oh shit. Okay.

Did you start speaking in Hebrew?
I'll beat your ass.

00:03:03,883 --> 00:03:05,954
Hold up, man, we're just trying
to get our shit together.

66
00:03:06,019 --> 00:03:08,226
Everybody shut the fuck up!

67
00:03:10,690 --> 00:03:12,966

00:03:13,026 --> 00:03:16,235

00:03:29,809 --> 00:03:32,289
You two bitch-ass niggas

77
00:03:36,115 --> 00:03:37,685
That's the motherfucking police

Yeah, yo, time to
roll up some, man

79
00:03:43,723 --> 00:03:45,225
Smoke something

80
00:03:45,291 --> 00:03:47,271
Grab a drink

81
00:03:47,327 --> 00:03:49,068
Grab something to smoke on

82
00:03:49,128 --> 00:03:50,607
Yeah, it's about that time

83
00:03:50,663 --> 00:03:52,643
We get high

84
00:03:56,469 --> 00:03:58,244
We get high

85
00:04:02,008 --> 00:04:04,079
We get high

86
00:04:08,014 --> 00:04:10,085
We get high

87
00:04:10,149 --> 00:04:11,856
Yo, how much is that?

88
00:04:13,686 --> 00:04:16,792
110 to spend with a friend?
Why not?

89
00:04:16,856 --> 00:04:19,837
My shit look like my eyelids
are inside out

90
00:04:19,892 --> 00:04:22,930
Not a dime this time,
but a nice-size quarter?

91
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:25,533
We call our shit coffee
but we don't dip it in that water

92
00:04:25,598 --> 00:04:28,374
We honor it with no sugar
and cream, straight green

93
00:04:28,434 --> 00:04:31,210
Then it's chicken and ribs,
baked beans, my plate's clean

94
00:04:31,271 --> 00:04:34,616
Then I find the rhythm,
mind if l give them a little?

95
00:04:34,674 --> 00:04:37,621
I'm kinda high right now
so I'll just go and hit a McGriddle

96
00:04:37,677 --> 00:04:39,486
And I'll twiddle my thumbs

97
00:04:39,545 --> 00:04:41,286
My direct connect is gone

98
00:04:41,347 --> 00:04:44,351
But my middle man is about
to come with some mo' 'dro

99
00:04:44,417 --> 00:04:47,728
Oh yo, you know the logo

100
00:04:47,787 --> 00:04:49,357
We higher than mofo,

101
00:05:06,372 --> 00:05:09,148
- Hey, son.
- What's up, Pops?

102
00:05:09,208 --> 00:05:11,654
Hey, son, so what'd you do today
for the betterment of your people?

103
00:05:11,711 --> 00:05:13,657
Come on, man, we gotta
do this every night?

104
00:05:13,713 --> 00:05:17,320
Every night of your life! As long as
the pigs are out there on the street

105
00:05:17,383 --> 00:05:20,455
killing your brothers
with the cold heat of their billy clubs

106
00:05:21,487 --> 00:05:23,728
Here

107
00:05:23,790 --> 00:05:25,565
Come on, man,
I'm out here struggling

108
00:05:25,625 --> 00:05:27,434
- Man, I ain't got time--
- Struggle!

109
00:05:27,493 --> 00:05:29,200
What you know about struggle?

110
00:05:29,262 --> 00:05:31,071
Try being
a political prisoner,

111
00:05:31,130 --> 00:05:33,610
locked up for the rest
of your natural life, brother

112
00:05:33,666 --> 00:05:36,169
- That's struggle.
- But you're not a prisoner, Pops

113
00:05:36,235 --> 00:05:38,715
You're free.
You retired from Ford, Pops

114
00:05:38,771 --> 00:05:40,842
Now you see? That's what's
wrong with you kids today.

115
00:05:40,907 --> 00:05:43,683
They've got you all brainwashed

116
00:05:43,743 --> 00:05:45,518
Damn rap music

117
00:05:45,578 --> 00:05:48,115
You know

118
00:05:48,181 --> 00:05:50,218
y'all had one cat. Um

119
00:05:50,283 --> 00:05:52,729
Teapac Secure

120
00:05:52,785 --> 00:05:55,231
Now that cat,
he was a soldier

121
00:05:55,288 --> 00:05:58,269
Then one of you young
ignorant bastards killed him

122
00:05:58,324 --> 00:06:01,237
You think you know everything, huh

123
00:06:01,294 --> 00:06:03,296
Shit!
Well, go on. Go on, boy

124
00:06:03,363 --> 00:06:06,776
Ain't no sense in watering
a tree that don't want to grow

125
00:06:08,167 --> 00:06:10,238
Hey!

126
00:06:10,303 --> 00:06:12,715
You got any weed?

127
00:06:12,772 --> 00:06:15,184
Man, I gotta get out
of this motherfucker

128
00:06:17,977 --> 00:06:19,923
Gourmet fiender

129
00:06:19,979 --> 00:06:21,890
From the gourmet fiender
for the fiender

130
00:06:21,948 --> 00:06:24,519
For the gourmet chocolate

131
00:06:24,584 --> 00:06:27,064
So many people ask
Who is the gourmet chocolate?"

132
00:06:27,120 --> 00:06:31,500
Nigga, I done told you
about slamming my damn door!

133
00:06:31,557 --> 00:06:35,232
Earl, you hear me talking to you?

134
00:06:35,294 --> 00:06:37,433
Yeah, you

00:06:37,497 --> 00:06:39,773
Bring your ass in here

00:06:39,832 --> 00:06:43,143
- Where the fuck have you been all day?

00:06:53,012 --> 00:06:55,424

00:06:59,185 --> 00:07:01,859

00:07:01,921 --> 00:07:03,525

00:07:03,589 --> 00:07:05,933

00:07:19,672 --> 00:07:22,585
Mm-hmm, mm-hmm,

00:07:22,642 --> 00:07:24,815
- Mm-hmm

00:07:27,513 --> 00:07:29,220
- That's so sweet.

154
00:07:29,282 --> 00:07:31,592
- You ain't had to do me like that
- Who am I?

155
00:07:31,651 --> 00:07:33,927

161
00:07:50,636 --> 00:07:52,946
Save me, they're killing me!

162
00:07:55,241 --> 00:07:57,847
Get off me.
I gotta get out of this shit.

163
00:08:00,646 --> 00:08:04,219
Lately, man, I've been thinking about
just getting out of the hood, dawg.

164
00:08:04,283 --> 00:08:05,921
Give me your change!

00:08:05,985 --> 00:08:07,328
No shit.

The hood cool and all. But, I mean

00:08:18,564 --> 00:08:21,374
- Fucking with her man!
- ...l think I need to find my own way

171
00:08:21,434 --> 00:08:23,436
'Cause I mean, shit

172
00:08:24,670 --> 00:08:26,081

00:08:37,283 --> 00:08:39,126
Next thing I know

00:08:39,185 --> 00:08:42,064
so I grabbed the nigga by the neck
like this and just started choking him

00:08:42,121 --> 00:08:44,761
I'm choking the shit outta the nigga,

I say, "Pussy nigga fuckboy!'

182
00:08:48,461 --> 00:08:50,463
The nigga started
regurgitating and shit

183
00:08:50,530 --> 00:08:52,737
So I pulled my little thing out
I just started

184
00:08:52,798 --> 00:08:55,642
- hitting the nigga with the pistol
- Hey, y'all keep it down!

185
00:08:55,701 --> 00:08:58,307
- This ain't no Def Comedy Jam
- Oh, okay.

186
00:08:58,371 --> 00:09:00,544
Nigga said calm down

- They raped Earl?
- No, man, he doesn't rape him!

213
00:10:24,323 --> 00:10:26,826
Not all convicts are gay

214
00:10:28,127 --> 00:10:30,664
- Really?
- You see, Wilbert is

215
00:10:30,730 --> 00:10:35,042

to share some of his secrets

216

with someone who could
benefit by them.

217
00:10:37,269 --> 00:10:39,215
You like plants

219
00:10:43,676 --> 00:10:45,713

00:16:35,127 --> 00:16:39,303
- How you doing, Run DMC?
- You're in trouble now, ain't you?

343
00:16:39,365 --> 00:16:42,676
Half a Dollar.
I understand that your little

344
00:16:42,735 --> 00:16:46,012
tour rap bus
broke down up yonder

345
00:16:46,071 --> 00:16:49,075
Now I heard you say you want
some kind of burger.

346
00:16:49,141 --> 00:16:52,884
There's a McDonald's about three,
four miles up the road there.

347
00:16:52,945 --> 00:16:55,289
You can get all
the chicken nuggets you want

348
00:16:55,347 --> 00:16:57,156
and fruit punch Kool-Aid

349
00:16:57,216 --> 00:16:59,662
And I'd advise you

350
00:16:59,718 --> 00:17:01,789
to get your black asses up

351
00:17:01,854 --> 00:17:04,357
and head the hell
on outta this town

352
00:17:04,423 --> 00:17:07,597
We moved here
to move away from ya

353
00:17:07,659 --> 00:17:10,538
Everywhere we move,
here come a couple of ya

354
00:17:10,596 --> 00:17:12,940
moving in, sending
the property value down

355
00:17:12,998 --> 00:17:14,671
I'm about to drop
this cracker ass.

356
00:17:14,733 --> 00:17:17,009
Whatcha gonna do, son?

357
00:17:20,372 --> 00:17:22,249
Hey, fellas, would y'all
take care of 'em,

358
00:17:22,307 --> 00:17:24,480
- make way and escort them out there
- We good, we good.

359
00:17:24,543 --> 00:17:26,716
- We good.
- Don't touch 'em

360
00:17:26,779 --> 00:17:28,656
You might catch it

361
00:17:28,714 --> 00:17:30,921
Touching you on the hand,
I tell you, the next time you know

362
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:32,462
your fingers turn black

363
00:17:45,464 --> 00:17:47,341
Hold up, hold up, hold up

364
00:17:47,399 --> 00:17:49,743
- Hey, fellas?
- Yeah, what's that?

365
00:17:49,802 --> 00:17:53,249
I want to thank y'all again
for showing me the nice hospitality

366
00:17:53,305 --> 00:17:55,876
Y'all showed me so much love
and I'm trying to figure out

367
00:17:55,941 --> 00:17:59,889
which one of you cracker's jaws
I'm gonna let suck my black dick!

368
00:17:59,945 --> 00:18:03,188
Holy Rick Astley shit!
Get them mother-crickets!

369
00:18:05,851 --> 00:18:09,298
What? They are so fucked
right now, nigga.

370
00:18:09,354 --> 00:18:12,824
It is a done daughter.
Them rednecks must've caught 'em,

371
00:18:12,891 --> 00:18:16,100
then sodomized them
and murderized them.

372
00:18:16,161 --> 00:18:17,469
Oooh

373
00:18:17,529 --> 00:18:19,736
Man, what is it
with you and sodomy?

374
00:18:19,798 --> 00:18:22,472
I mean that's the way
all these stories end, man

375
00:18:22,534 --> 00:18:24,480
They fuck you
and they kill you

376
00:18:24,536 --> 00:18:26,174
Nigga, ain't you seen "Deliverance
II?

377
00:18:26,238 --> 00:18:28,445
No, they don't get screwed or killed

378
00:18:28,507 --> 00:18:29,815
They get away

379
00:18:29,975 --> 00:18:32,353
- Itch, though, right?
- I don't think so, man

380
00:18:32,411 --> 00:18:34,357
Use Blue Star ointment?

381
00:18:34,413 --> 00:18:36,518
But that don't usually work
most of the time.

382
00:18:36,582 --> 00:18:37,754
- No shit?
- Not really

383
00:18:37,816 --> 00:18:39,796
Gotta shave all the hair
off my nuts, huh?

384
00:18:39,852 --> 00:18:41,661
- I had to shave my asshole
- Oooh.

385
00:18:41,720 --> 00:18:45,964
Howdy, cowboys!
Welcome to the Dixieland Hotel

386
00:18:46,024 --> 00:18:49,028
So tell me, how many
"D"s are in Dixie.

387
00:18:49,094 --> 00:18:50,437
- One.
- No, darling!

388
00:18:50,496 --> 00:18:55,468
There are 35.
DD-DD-DD-D-D-D-D-D-D--

389
00:18:55,534 --> 00:18:57,878
Okay, you boys look exhausted

390
00:18:57,936 --> 00:18:59,882
Like you've been out
on the range all day.

391
00:18:59,938 --> 00:19:02,509
I'm gonna tell you
what you need: a good meal,

392
00:19:02,574 --> 00:19:04,485
a hot tub
and a nice warm bed

393
00:19:04,543 --> 00:19:06,352
to put that little head on

394
00:19:06,411 --> 00:19:08,982
That's what I'm talking about.
You gonna come put me in the bed?

395
00:19:09,047 --> 00:19:11,527
- Sounds good to you, doesn't it?
- Mm-hmm.

396
00:19:11,583 --> 00:19:13,460
What's it gonna be?

397
00:19:13,519 --> 00:19:16,090
Two rooms?
Or maybe one?

398
00:19:16,155 --> 00:19:18,362
- One.
- And is that gonna be

399
00:19:18,423 --> 00:19:20,903
two beds or one?

400
00:19:20,959 --> 00:19:22,632
- Bitch, two! What the fuck?
- Two!

401
00:19:22,694 --> 00:19:26,904
Okay okay, I got to ask.
It doesn't happen very often,

402
00:19:26,965 --> 00:19:30,674
but every now and then we get
some of those life "partner" types

403
00:19:30,736 --> 00:19:33,546
- You know what I mean.
- No, there ain't nothing like this

404
00:19:33,605 --> 00:19:36,848
- We're definitely not life partners
- Okay.

405
00:19:36,909 --> 00:19:38,911
Now y'all want smoking
or non-smoking?

406
00:19:38,977 --> 00:19:40,251
Smoking

407
00:19:40,312 --> 00:19:43,418
- Smoking that weed
- Feeling fine

408
00:19:43,482 --> 00:19:46,520
- Got me a party
- And a fat-ass dime

409
00:19:46,585 --> 00:19:49,395
How about
a little weed for me?

410
00:19:51,356 --> 00:19:54,428
- You a Compton sister.
- Just go on upstairs and have a ball

411
00:19:54,493 --> 00:19:57,474
All right, baby.
She all right to me

412
00:19:59,631 --> 00:20:02,373
Boy, those chili cheese fries
was off the chain, man.

413
00:20:02,434 --> 00:20:05,278
Oooh, for real. I think
she cooked them mothers herself

414
00:20:05,337 --> 00:20:07,613
Yeah, man.
Mara's kinda feisty

415
00:20:07,673 --> 00:20:09,983
She probably was fine
as fuck back in the day

416
00:20:10,042 --> 00:20:12,079
If it was the '60s, shit, I'd fuck

417
00:20:12,144 --> 00:20:14,681
While you're bullshittin' it
I'm fucking that.

418
00:20:14,746 --> 00:20:17,886
Man, hold up, man. You smoked
too much for real this time, man.

419
00:20:17,950 --> 00:20:19,554
You blowing my high, man

420
00:20:19,618 --> 00:20:22,258
Oh shit

421
00:20:22,321 --> 00:20:24,961
- Man, it's the Kush
- Oh, that's my shit

422
00:20:25,023 --> 00:20:26,900
I ain't never seen
this shit before.

423
00:20:26,959 --> 00:20:29,565
Man, watch, check it out,
while we be tripping.

424
00:20:29,628 --> 00:20:31,835
- I heard about this shit.
- Here, smoke. You need to smoke

425
00:20:31,897 --> 00:20:33,604
- while you look at that
- Okay.

426
00:20:33,665 --> 00:20:35,906
And US veteran Akura Kushimota,

427
00:20:35,968 --> 00:20:39,177
publically known as Master Kush
is wanted for murder.

428
00:20:39,238 --> 00:20:41,616
Leading the investigation
is Special Agent Rico--

429
00:20:41,673 --> 00:20:45,086
Yo yo yo yo,
that's some mad lies

430
00:20:45,143 --> 00:20:47,851
Leader Kush never killed no one

431
00:20:49,248 --> 00:20:52,127
Hey, true dat.
Get out, Kush

432
00:21:12,337 --> 00:21:15,807
Get down! Smoke him

433
00:21:15,874 --> 00:21:18,013
Move in, move in

434
00:21:18,076 --> 00:21:19,817
Pull back, he's got a gun

435
00:21:19,878 --> 00:21:21,824
It's weapons of mass destruction

436
00:21:39,898 --> 00:21:42,674
Watch out!
It's the kush goo!

437
00:21:56,782 --> 00:21:58,352
HEB?

438
00:21:58,417 --> 00:22:00,727
Oh no, no-ooo!

439
00:22:05,557 --> 00:22:07,901
Will Master Kush be hunted down

440
00:22:07,959 --> 00:22:09,939
and captured by the ICU?

441
00:22:09,995 --> 00:22:12,999
Will ICU propaganda
successfully tarnish

442
00:22:13,065 --> 00:22:16,171
the good name of Kush?
Will the ICU

443
00:22:16,234 --> 00:22:18,612
use their evil influence and release

444
00:22:18,670 --> 00:22:20,479
the dark energy into the world?

445
00:22:20,539 --> 00:22:24,385
Will fear, mass paranoia
and government conspiracy

446
00:22:24,443 --> 00:22:27,515
be the ultimate downfall of Master Kush?

447
00:22:27,579 --> 00:22:29,115
All this and more

448
00:22:29,181 --> 00:22:31,388
When Kush Comes to Shove

449
00:22:31,450 --> 00:22:34,090
- That hurt.
- M-M-Master Kush

450
00:23:00,345 --> 00:23:03,224
I'm having a meeting with the toilet

451
00:23:04,616 --> 00:23:06,459
You gonna have to hurry up, man

452
00:23:06,518 --> 00:23:08,054
What you doing?

453
00:23:08,120 --> 00:23:10,794
Making a decision

454
00:23:10,856 --> 00:23:13,462
You gotta
come back later, man

455
00:23:14,793 --> 00:23:17,330
Smoking up all the fucking weed
I know what he doing.

456
00:23:19,030 --> 00:23:21,738
Free up your mind and pull up
some fresh brew

457
00:23:21,800 --> 00:23:23,780
Blowing out my mind
cloud nine

458
00:23:23,835 --> 00:23:25,872
Where I stay,
so I blaze some weed

459
00:23:25,937 --> 00:23:27,610
We've been riding forever, man

460
00:23:27,672 --> 00:23:30,152
I'm tired of this shit.
What time we gonna get there?

461
00:23:30,208 --> 00:23:32,449
- Man, you know what?
- What?

462
00:23:32,511 --> 00:23:35,720
Before we get to where we're going, man,
I think we need to get some new gear.

463
00:23:35,781 --> 00:23:36,987
Think there gonna be
some mothers out there?

464
00:23:37,048 --> 00:23:40,427
No, nigga. I ain't-- I'm talking
about some clothes so we can fit in

465
00:23:40,485 --> 00:23:42,260
So we won't stick out
as much, man.

466
00:23:42,320 --> 00:23:43,890
Like what?
What type of gear?

467
00:23:43,955 --> 00:23:46,697
Shit, I don't know.
What do country motherfuckers wear?

468
00:23:48,126 --> 00:23:50,265
Cowboy shit?

469
00:23:50,328 --> 00:23:52,308
Yeah, I guess

470
00:23:53,565 --> 00:23:55,101
Man, when we get
up in here, man,

471
00:23:55,167 --> 00:23:57,340
make sure you play it cool

472
00:23:57,402 --> 00:23:59,905
Don't be doing shit that'll
bring attention to us, man

473
00:23:59,971 --> 00:24:02,042
Come on, dawg

474
00:24:02,107 --> 00:24:04,553
I 9011 you

475
00:24:04,609 --> 00:24:06,611
All of you freaks

476
00:24:06,678 --> 00:24:08,954
And all of you boozers

477
00:24:09,014 --> 00:24:10,823
All of you cheats

478
00:24:10,882 --> 00:24:13,055
Emil

479
00:24:13,118 --> 00:24:15,189
Yeee--

480
00:24:15,253 --> 00:24:16,857
--haw

481
00:24:16,922 --> 00:24:19,368
Hey there,
Boom Boom Belinda

482
00:24:20,892 --> 00:24:22,997
Let me get some of that--
both of them.

483
00:24:23,061 --> 00:24:25,940
It's another lost weekend
stuck in this town...

484
00:24:25,997 --> 00:24:27,203
He ain't gonna need this

485
00:24:27,265 --> 00:24:28,642
Hey, where you going?
Where you going?

486
00:24:28,700 --> 00:24:30,441
Where you going?
Where you going?

487
00:24:33,238 --> 00:24:36,082
You can get that two in that
corner pocket if you just go at it.

488
00:24:38,610 --> 00:24:40,055
Smile!

489
00:24:42,514 --> 00:24:43,993
I like that.
Let me get it

490
00:24:44,049 --> 00:24:45,551
Okay, babe

491
00:24:52,357 --> 00:24:54,837
Give them a little "Whoa,

492
00:24:54,893 --> 00:24:57,169
ho ho ho!"

493
00:25:03,368 --> 00:25:05,075
Hey, come on, man
You're crazy.

494
00:25:05,136 --> 00:25:06,308
Listen to me.
You're tripping

495
00:25:10,575 --> 00:25:14,022
- Can I get you guys something to drink?
- Yeah.

496
00:25:14,079 --> 00:25:18,391
Let me get a li'l sarsaparilla

497
00:25:18,450 --> 00:25:20,828
Knock off that cowboy shit

498
00:25:20,886 --> 00:25:23,059
This ain't the place

499
00:25:25,924 --> 00:25:29,235
Oh. My bad

500
00:25:31,429 --> 00:25:33,375
Now if you're looking for some reefer,

501
00:25:33,431 --> 00:25:35,741
stick around till after we close

502
00:25:37,068 --> 00:25:39,309
- For sure
- Whoo.

503
00:26:00,125 --> 00:26:02,401
Uh, was that drunk bitch pregnant

504
00:26:02,460 --> 00:26:04,497
or was that pregnant bitch drunk?

505
00:26:13,405 --> 00:26:17,012
- Is that what I think it is?
- Oh, yeah yeah.

506
00:26:24,950 --> 00:26:27,430
Bring it here.
Come here, come on, come on in

507
00:26:27,485 --> 00:26:30,989
Now let me guess.
You guys are here

508
00:26:31,056 --> 00:26:33,468
- looking for crops
- How you know?

509
00:26:33,525 --> 00:26:36,062
The only black cowboys I know

510
00:26:36,127 --> 00:26:38,129
play football in Dallas

511
00:26:38,196 --> 00:26:40,676
mama

512
00:26:40,732 --> 00:26:43,144
Yeah well, shit.
What's up with the trees then, man?

513
00:26:43,201 --> 00:26:45,875
My man here said they got acres
of that shit growing out here.

514
00:26:45,937 --> 00:26:49,180
- That's an understatement
- Fuck.

515
00:26:49,240 --> 00:26:52,687
Kentucky yields
the most marijuana crops

516
00:26:52,744 --> 00:26:55,054
in the nation

517
00:26:55,113 --> 00:26:57,821
If you're driving through,
just roll down your windows

518
00:26:57,882 --> 00:26:59,953
- You could smell it in the air
- No shit.

519
00:27:00,018 --> 00:27:03,124
I thought I smelled it.
When I was on my way up there

520
00:27:03,188 --> 00:27:06,169
- I did smell it.
- That's 'cause we was smoking on one

521
00:27:08,059 --> 00:27:10,300
You ain't wrong when you're right

522
00:27:10,362 --> 00:27:14,674
Let me guess:
you guys came up in here

523
00:27:14,733 --> 00:27:16,576
in hopes of finding
one of those crops?

524
00:27:16,635 --> 00:27:18,546
Snatching a couple of pounds

525
00:27:18,603 --> 00:27:20,674
and going down to sell it in the hood

526
00:27:20,739 --> 00:27:23,276
You're damn right, Iron Sheik

527
00:27:25,710 --> 00:27:28,054
Oh, I get it

528
00:27:28,113 --> 00:27:31,390
You're the funny one.
Well, we'll see how funny you are

529
00:27:31,449 --> 00:27:34,055
when one of these hillbillies
has a cow prod up your ass,

530
00:27:34,119 --> 00:27:36,963
forcing you to drink ice water
and chew on aluminum foil.

531
00:27:37,022 --> 00:27:40,060
My booty hole just started burning
What type of gay shit?

532
00:27:41,860 --> 00:27:43,362
All right, man,
for real, man.

533
00:27:43,428 --> 00:27:45,237
Can you tell us
where the crops are?

534
00:27:45,296 --> 00:27:48,140
Well, you gotta be a little
more specific than that.

535
00:27:48,199 --> 00:27:50,975
You just don't walk into McDonald's
and say "I want a hamburger."

536
00:27:51,036 --> 00:27:53,676
- You got the Barack Obama?
- What kind they got?

537
00:27:53,738 --> 00:27:56,275
- EL Presidential
- It all depends

538
00:27:56,341 --> 00:27:58,150
on how far are you
willing to go.

539
00:27:58,209 --> 00:28:00,120
I mean you can hike
for about a day

540
00:28:00,178 --> 00:28:02,283
and find a pretty decent
chronic crop.

541
00:28:02,347 --> 00:28:07,057
But if you're willing to dodge
a couple of bullets

542
00:28:07,118 --> 00:28:09,120
- and booby traps
- Mm-hmm.

543
00:28:09,187 --> 00:28:11,929
You can find that sticky green,

544
00:28:11,990 --> 00:28:14,061
crystallized,

545
00:28:14,125 --> 00:28:16,071
extraterrestrial-type shit

546
00:28:16,127 --> 00:28:19,199
that shit that tastes like candy
when you smoke it.

547
00:28:19,264 --> 00:28:20,902
Oh shit, I'm up in that

548
00:28:20,965 --> 00:28:23,741
Man, did you hear what
he said before that shit?

549
00:28:23,802 --> 00:28:26,442
Man, I'm not fucking with no bullets
or no booby traps, man.

550
00:28:26,504 --> 00:28:28,484
Can you tell us how to get
to one of the ones, like,

551
00:28:28,540 --> 00:28:30,520
right off one
of these roads somewhere?

552
00:28:30,575 --> 00:28:32,452
All right, all right,
but trust me.

553
00:28:32,510 --> 00:28:35,354
You'll be back

554
00:28:35,413 --> 00:28:37,654
Can I get some
of that now? Shit

555
00:28:37,716 --> 00:28:40,595
Y'all done passed it back and forth
like y'all know each other.

556
00:28:42,721 --> 00:28:44,359
So what the guys didn't know

557
00:28:44,422 --> 00:28:47,665
was that I was waiting
for this opportunity for years

558
00:28:51,262 --> 00:28:54,402
- What opportunity?
- My sweet little baby girl

559
00:28:54,466 --> 00:28:57,970
my daughter Marie--
she was held captive

560
00:28:58,036 --> 00:29:00,414
by sick, sadistic hillbillies

561
00:29:00,472 --> 00:29:02,918
- A group of them
- Oh, I get it.

562
00:29:02,974 --> 00:29:06,421
So he get him a piece of that
young hillbilly kinootchi

563
00:29:06,478 --> 00:29:07,980
while he up there, fuck around

564
00:29:08,046 --> 00:29:10,788
and leave a seed
in the background, huh?

565
00:29:10,849 --> 00:29:13,796
- Exactly.
- Should've pulled out

566
00:29:13,852 --> 00:29:16,696
I'd do it.
Called the rhythm method

567
00:29:16,755 --> 00:29:18,462
or some shit like that

568
00:29:18,523 --> 00:29:21,402
I tried several times to free her,

569
00:29:21,459 --> 00:29:23,461
but it didn't work out

570
00:29:23,528 --> 00:29:25,974
Damn, that's fucked up

571
00:29:26,030 --> 00:29:28,874
Yeah, so I seen these guys
as the perfect opportunity

572
00:29:28,933 --> 00:29:32,540
to set her free, but first I had
to bait the hook a little.

573
00:29:37,542 --> 00:29:40,421
Man, where in the hell
this fool Sanchez send us, man?

574
00:29:40,478 --> 00:29:43,687
I don't know. He said
look for the Highway 420 sign

575
00:29:45,650 --> 00:29:48,324
There it is right there
That's it right there.

576
00:29:48,386 --> 00:29:50,059
Let's do this shit

577
00:29:51,089 --> 00:29:52,966
Come on, let's go

578
00:29:54,993 --> 00:29:57,371
- You hear this shit?
- This is the forest, nigga.

579
00:29:57,428 --> 00:29:59,931
Man, let's just be rappers.
Let's go back home, let's be rappers

580
00:29:59,998 --> 00:30:01,807
Man, come on, man.
Bring your scary-ass on, man

581
00:30:01,866 --> 00:30:03,937
- Let's go, man
- Eh, shit!

582
00:30:04,002 --> 00:30:05,174
Fucking with you

583
00:30:09,808 --> 00:30:12,789
Okay, according to Sanchez,
there should be somewhere

584
00:30:12,844 --> 00:30:16,189
- to camp right up in here somewhere
- Camp?! Hold up, hold up.

585
00:30:16,247 --> 00:30:19,057
The fuck you mean "camp"?
Black people don't camp.

586
00:30:20,752 --> 00:30:23,028
We cook out. We picnic

587
00:30:23,087 --> 00:30:25,658
We party, have a good time,
get on that cocaine and leave

588
00:30:25,723 --> 00:30:27,964
You got me fucked up, nigga.
I'm gonna stay out of this motherfucker

589
00:30:28,026 --> 00:30:29,664
I ain't gonna be
on nobody's news. Shit

590
00:30:29,727 --> 00:30:31,502
Man, you trying to get
this weed or what, man?

591
00:30:31,563 --> 00:30:35,238
Now if I can remember correctly,
this was your idea from the beginning

592
00:30:35,300 --> 00:30:37,746
- Not this part.
- Shit, man, I don't know about you,

593
00:30:37,802 --> 00:30:40,510
man, but I'm tired of this
nickel-and-dime shit we've been doing

594
00:30:40,572 --> 00:30:42,210
I'm trying to get
this paper for real, man

595
00:30:42,273 --> 00:30:44,685
This right here could be
our meal ticket outta the hood

596
00:30:44,742 --> 00:30:46,551
So what you want to do?

597
00:30:49,147 --> 00:30:50,820
You should be a actor, man

598
00:30:50,882 --> 00:30:53,795
'Cause I felt that. I felt like
the movie-- on "Menace ll Society

599
00:30:53,852 --> 00:30:56,264
when he said "You gonna let
that nigga kill your cousin?

600
00:30:56,321 --> 00:30:58,267
Let that shit ride?
Fuck that!"

601
00:30:58,323 --> 00:31:00,599
That's how I-- whoa, shit.
What the-- you hear that shit?

602
00:31:00,658 --> 00:31:02,160
Man, whatever, man
Come on, man.

603
00:31:02,227 --> 00:31:04,798
No, but I'm for real though
I feel what you're saying.

604
00:31:04,863 --> 00:31:07,207
- Real good talk.
- Pfft, that's bullshit, man

605
00:31:14,772 --> 00:31:16,809
Man, what if we do come up?

606
00:31:16,875 --> 00:31:18,980
What you gonna do
with all the brick?

607
00:31:19,043 --> 00:31:21,421
Shit, first thing I'm a do, man,

608
00:31:21,479 --> 00:31:24,551
I'm a get me a motherfucking
'58 Chevy Impala, nigga.

609
00:31:24,616 --> 00:31:27,825
Put some bang in that bitch
throw some "D"s on that ho

610
00:31:27,886 --> 00:31:30,628
You know, get it ready for the summer
You know what I'm saying?

611
00:31:30,688 --> 00:31:32,292
- I feel you, nigga
- Yeah yeah.

612
00:31:32,357 --> 00:31:34,394
Shit, after that though
I'll have to get me a spot

613
00:31:34,459 --> 00:31:36,530
You know,
somewhere outside of the hood

614
00:31:36,594 --> 00:31:40,167
where I don't have to worry about
catching a stray bullet in my sleep

615
00:31:40,231 --> 00:31:42,507
Nigga, I definitely feel you
on that shit, nigga.

616
00:31:42,567 --> 00:31:45,070
- Shit.
- What about you, man?

617
00:31:45,136 --> 00:31:46,547
- What you gonna do?

618
00:31:46,604 --> 00:31:49,380
I might take Shante
on a trip to Jamaica

619
00:31:50,975 --> 00:31:53,751
Probably sit on the beach
or some shit, chill out.

620
00:31:53,811 --> 00:31:56,382
- With a fat blunt of course
- Mm-hmm.

621
00:31:56,447 --> 00:31:59,917
Me sittin' there smoking a good one
and have her run into the water,

622
00:31:59,984 --> 00:32:02,828
with a nice pretty thong

623
00:32:02,887 --> 00:32:06,164
where I don't see nothing
but her ass just jiggling.

624
00:32:07,558 --> 00:32:09,060
And then, shit

625
00:32:09,127 --> 00:32:10,936
I gotta buy something
for the kids,

626
00:32:10,995 --> 00:32:13,771
so I'll probably take all them
motherfuckers out to the toy store

627
00:32:13,831 --> 00:32:17,040
and just let them ball till they fall
you know what I'm saying?

628
00:32:17,101 --> 00:32:20,344
But I'm definitely moving out
of the motherfucking hood.

629
00:32:20,405 --> 00:32:23,875
- Hell yeah.
- Shit, but I been thinking

630
00:32:23,942 --> 00:32:26,218
I don't really know
where the fuck to go

631
00:32:26,277 --> 00:32:28,018
- What do you mean?
- Shit, I mean

632
00:32:28,079 --> 00:32:30,559
I don't want to be around
no white folks and shit.

633
00:32:30,615 --> 00:32:33,721
You know what I'm saying?
I ain't trying to live by none of them

634
00:32:33,785 --> 00:32:35,560
Yeah, I know

635
00:32:35,620 --> 00:32:37,930
I wonder is there a spot
for people like us,

636
00:32:37,989 --> 00:32:40,265
like rich broke niggas.
You know what I'm saying?

637
00:32:40,325 --> 00:32:43,670
Niggas that made a little money
made their way up out the hood

638
00:32:43,728 --> 00:32:47,904
You know, I don't know.
There's gotta be somewhere

639
00:32:49,267 --> 00:32:51,543
Baa,

640
00:32:51,602 --> 00:32:53,775
I'm about to crash, man
It's been a long day.

641
00:32:53,838 --> 00:32:55,476
Holla at you

642
00:32:55,540 --> 00:32:57,747
All right, cool.
You got some lotion?

643
00:32:57,809 --> 00:33:00,255
No no,
I ain't got no lotion

644
00:33:00,311 --> 00:33:02,291
Give me that Off.
It'll work the same

645
00:33:02,347 --> 00:33:06,227
Off?
You meaning Jack-Off?

646
00:33:06,284 --> 00:33:09,697
- Don't judge me.
- Man, you a nasty motherfucker

647
00:33:12,123 --> 00:33:15,263
- Shoot that way.
- Don't be in my way

648
00:33:26,604 --> 00:33:28,550
- Uh-oh.
- What's up, man?

649
00:33:28,606 --> 00:33:30,677
I gotta boo-boo

650
00:33:30,742 --> 00:33:32,813
Can you hold it till the blunt?

651
00:33:32,877 --> 00:33:36,324
No, man, my-- my stomach
is beefin' with my asshole.

652
00:33:36,381 --> 00:33:38,554
And I think my stomach
winning this beef.

653
00:33:38,616 --> 00:33:41,563
- Hurry up, man.
- Hold this for me, man

654
00:33:41,619 --> 00:33:42,927
I gotta go boo-boo

655
00:33:59,070 --> 00:34:01,880
Damn, when did I eat almonds?

656
00:34:03,041 --> 00:34:04,384
Uh-oh, that ain't it

657
00:34:05,576 --> 00:34:06,953
Shit

658
00:34:09,981 --> 00:34:11,790
Can't use that shit.

659
00:34:11,849 --> 00:34:14,227
Don't know what you gonna
wipe your ass with.

660
00:34:21,392 --> 00:34:23,429
Whoo!

661
00:34:23,494 --> 00:34:26,100
'Bout time, man. Shit, I was
about to leave without you.

662
00:34:26,164 --> 00:34:29,577
Hey, boy, don't go in that
west wing of the forest.

663
00:34:29,634 --> 00:34:31,910
I shut it down

664
00:34:34,205 --> 00:34:36,185
I'm just living, man.
All these daggone--

665
00:34:36,240 --> 00:34:38,083
Man, take this, man

666
00:34:38,142 --> 00:34:39,746
This heavier than a motherfucker

667
00:34:39,811 --> 00:34:42,189
Oh, you ain't say nothing
so what am I supposed to do?

668
00:34:44,682 --> 00:34:46,855
Say, man, you smell something?

669
00:34:46,918 --> 00:34:48,522
Hey, man, stop playing with me

670
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:50,497
I wiped my ass good
with that furry rabbit.

671
00:34:50,555 --> 00:34:53,399
- What, nigga?
- Nothin', never mind

672
00:34:53,458 --> 00:34:55,131
- These trees are--
- No, but for real, man

673
00:34:55,193 --> 00:34:57,002
I smell something
Man, that's weed.

674
00:34:57,061 --> 00:34:59,735
That smell like some fire too

675
00:34:59,797 --> 00:35:01,777
That shit's some killer, nigga!

676
00:35:01,833 --> 00:35:03,938
- Oh shit!
- Whoo.

677
00:35:04,001 --> 00:35:05,571
But where it's coming from?

678

Oh my Lord.
Oh my-- oh, I want to--

698
00:35:54,819 --> 00:35:56,765
Well, boys,

00:35:56,821 --> 00:35:59,734
looks like we've got ourselves
some pot farmers.

700
00:36:03,060 --> 00:36:05,267
Well, let's get 'em!
Yeehaw!

Smoke something

704
00:36:12,303 --> 00:36:14,408
Grab a drank

705
00:36:14,472 --> 00:36:15,746
Grab something to smoke on

706
00:36:15,806 --> 00:36:17,046
Yeah, babe, it's about that time

707
00:36:17,108 --> 00:36:18,610
We get high

708
00:36:22,580 --> 00:36:24,787
We get high

709
00:36:28,586 --> 00:36:30,725
We get high

710
00:36:34,559 --> 00:36:36,300
We get high

711
00:36:36,360 --> 00:36:37,727
Yo, how much is that?

712
00:36:37,728 --> 00:36:38,570
Yo, how much is that?

713
00:36:38,629 --> 00:36:42,099
Man, I don't think I had
no weed like this ever in my life

714
00:36:42,166 --> 00:36:43,907
Man, this is some good shit, man

715
00:36:43,968 --> 00:36:45,879
No shit. We done
came up on a lick, man

716
00:36:45,937 --> 00:36:48,247
I'm telling you. But I'm hungrier
than a motherfucker.

717
00:36:48,306 --> 00:36:51,048
I wish they had a Busy Bee's
around this motherfucker.

718
00:36:51,108 --> 00:36:53,281
I feel like eating
some catfish or something?

719
00:36:53,344 --> 00:36:56,621
I'm a fuck you up
with this one though, Ray

720
00:36:59,217 --> 00:37:00,958
Adam fucked Eve raw

721
00:37:03,254 --> 00:37:06,133
- That's some deep shit
- I know it is, boy!

722
00:37:07,592 --> 00:37:09,833
Man, we gonna be on top,
nigga, when come back to--

723
00:37:09,894 --> 00:37:11,874
Hold it, you hear that?

724
00:37:13,898 --> 00:37:16,936
- Nigga, you tripping
- No-- okay.

725
00:37:19,971 --> 00:37:22,884
Man, I might go ahead and give
myself to God after this, man.

726
00:37:22,940 --> 00:37:25,784
Man, you know what? I was gonna
tell you something too, man.

727
00:37:25,843 --> 00:37:28,050
You hold on to the weed too long

728
00:37:28,112 --> 00:37:30,058
Freeze!

729
00:37:30,114 --> 00:37:32,060
Are we high?

730
00:37:32,116 --> 00:37:34,062
Tell me your name, boy

731
00:37:34,118 --> 00:37:36,564
Man, I ain't saying nothing
until I talk to my lawyer.

732
00:37:36,621 --> 00:37:40,034
Ain't no Minister Farrakhan
gonna help you here, boy.

733
00:37:41,726 --> 00:37:45,640
Now my daddy's the judge
in the only courthouse for 200 miles,

734
00:37:45,696 --> 00:37:48,836
so I suggest you
show me some respect!

735
00:37:48,899 --> 00:37:51,743
Man, I ain't saying nothing
until I talk to my lawyer.

736
00:37:51,802 --> 00:37:54,305
Damn!
I hate that

737
00:37:56,274 --> 00:37:57,844
Now you lookie here, Earl

738
00:37:57,908 --> 00:38:00,889
You're looking
at a whole mess of jail time

739
00:38:00,945 --> 00:38:05,951
And let me tell you,
those big hairy redneck convicts

740
00:38:06,017 --> 00:38:09,726
sure ain't gonna go light
on your little black butthole

741
00:38:09,787 --> 00:38:12,495
Unless of course
they take a shine to you

742
00:38:12,556 --> 00:38:14,729
and they tell you that
you have a purty mouth

743
00:38:32,276 --> 00:38:34,222
We call it "Deliverance 2

744
00:38:34,278 --> 00:38:36,849
- The Dark Side
- No no no.

745
00:38:38,082 --> 00:38:40,562
So tell me who you're with

746
00:38:40,618 --> 00:38:43,497
The Gatsfields or the McRoys?

747
00:38:44,588 --> 00:38:46,363
WEE

748
00:38:46,424 --> 00:38:48,404
Don't play dumb with me, stupid

749
00:38:49,627 --> 00:38:51,868
I'm telling you,
we have been watching

750
00:38:51,929 --> 00:38:55,172
the McCoys and Gatsfields
for more than two years now

751
00:38:55,232 --> 00:38:58,873
Neither one of these clowns
would have anything to do with them

752
00:38:58,936 --> 00:39:01,883
Well, then who the hell are they?

753
00:39:01,939 --> 00:39:04,442
Don't know.
Mutt and Jeff

754
00:39:04,508 --> 00:39:06,579
Frick and Frack,
Fucking Kid 'n Play

755
00:39:06,644 --> 00:39:08,555
Who gives a shit?
Let 'em go.

756
00:39:11,015 --> 00:39:14,986
Come on, Earl. Suck it up.
Tell me whose pot farm it is

757
00:39:16,487 --> 00:39:18,626
Yeah yeah!

758
00:39:18,689 --> 00:39:20,464
Hey hey hey,
you're free to go now

759
00:39:20,524 --> 00:39:21,594
- Come on.
- What what?

760
00:39:21,659 --> 00:39:23,639
Let him go!
You got the wrong guy

761
00:39:23,694 --> 00:39:25,799
No no no, but he just confessed

762
00:39:25,863 --> 00:39:27,843
Yeah, you scared him
half to damn death, man

763
00:39:27,898 --> 00:39:29,878
- Hey, my man, get outta here. Go go!
- Huh?

764
00:39:29,934 --> 00:39:31,845
Stop slobbering
and get your ass up outta here

765
00:39:31,902 --> 00:39:33,973
-Me?
-Bye-bye.

766
00:39:34,038 --> 00:39:35,984
You sure?

767
00:39:38,542 --> 00:39:40,522
I can go.
Okay, I can go

768
00:39:45,082 --> 00:39:46,356
- Pussy!
- Hey!

769
00:39:46,417 --> 00:39:48,658
What are you doing, man?
Let me tell you something:

770
00:39:48,719 --> 00:39:50,255
you are wasting our time, all right?

771
00:39:50,321 --> 00:39:52,096
And you're bringing
too much attention to this investigation

772
00:39:52,156 --> 00:39:53,829
with your hillbilly style of cop work

773
00:39:53,891 --> 00:39:55,666
Lemme-- lemme tell
you something, my man,

774
00:39:55,726 --> 00:39:57,706
this is how this is
gonna go down, okay?

775
00:39:57,762 --> 00:39:59,742
You gonna leave
the drug bust to us,

776
00:39:59,797 --> 00:40:03,335
while you stick
to writing traffic tickets

777
00:40:03,401 --> 00:40:06,007
and breaking up domestic
disputes, you understand?

778
00:40:06,070 --> 00:40:08,311
- That's a pretty good accent
- Thank you.

779
00:40:08,372 --> 00:40:10,648
Yam

780
00:40:10,708 --> 00:40:12,813
- Yes.
- Good

781
00:40:20,985 --> 00:40:22,328
Feds

782
00:40:25,089 --> 00:40:26,591
Look at Tony!
There's Tony.

783
00:40:26,657 --> 00:40:27,692
Hell no

784
00:40:27,758 --> 00:40:29,533
Told y'all we was innocent!

785
00:40:29,593 --> 00:40:31,300
- Yeah, nigga.
- God damn it

786
00:40:31,362 --> 00:40:33,899
It's just like the white male
trying to keep a brother down

787
00:40:33,964 --> 00:40:35,671
Oh yeah, and I forgot to tell y'all

788
00:40:35,733 --> 00:40:37,610
Minister Farrakhan said what's up

789
00:40:37,668 --> 00:40:39,614
Alaikum assalam

790
00:40:42,940 --> 00:40:44,715
Sign there

791
00:40:44,775 --> 00:40:47,984
- Where my EBT card at?
- Hey, wait a minute.

792
00:40:48,045 --> 00:40:50,548
- Where are my keys, man?
- You mean these?

793
00:40:50,614 --> 00:40:53,993
Damn, did I forget to tell you?
No, you ain't getting 'em back.

794
00:40:54,051 --> 00:40:56,793
What the fuck you mean
you ain't give me my keys, man?

795
00:40:56,854 --> 00:40:59,698
Apparently you got expired tags
so we had to impound it.

796
00:40:59,757 --> 00:41:01,703
- My car?!
- That's my car

797
00:41:01,759 --> 00:41:04,069
- Oh.
- Now you boys are resourceful

798
00:41:04,128 --> 00:41:07,701
I'm sure you'll have a long refreshing
walk all the way back to Compton.

799
00:41:10,534 --> 00:41:13,447
Unless of course you want to stay.
We're gonna do some shooting later

800
00:41:13,504 --> 00:41:15,313
No, we're good, we're good
Let's go, let's go.

801
00:41:15,372 --> 00:41:17,875
Just gonna shoot
some cans is all. Jamai-cans,

802
00:41:17,942 --> 00:41:20,786
Mexi-cans, Puerto Ri-cans

803
00:41:20,845 --> 00:41:22,825
Afri-cans.

804
00:41:22,880 --> 00:41:25,793
- Now what the hell we supposed to do?
- Shit, I don't know, man.

805
00:41:25,850 --> 00:41:27,557
Shit, who the fuck can we call?

806
00:41:27,618 --> 00:41:31,156
Now with no car, no money
and no way to get home,

807
00:41:31,222 --> 00:41:33,429
I had them just where
I wanted them.

808
00:41:33,491 --> 00:41:36,802
It was time to put
my plan in motion

809
00:41:36,861 --> 00:41:39,068
Shit, I don't know

810
00:41:39,129 --> 00:41:41,075
Hold up!

811
00:41:41,131 --> 00:41:42,542
Sanchez

812
00:41:45,970 --> 00:41:47,643
Fellas, back so soon?

813
00:41:47,705 --> 00:41:50,015
Yeah, man, we're in
a real fucking bind now, man

814
00:41:50,074 --> 00:41:52,315
They done fuck around
and pop me for my shit

815
00:41:52,376 --> 00:41:55,220
- and they took his car.
- We barely got any money left, man,

816
00:41:55,279 --> 00:41:57,555
- and no way home now.
- Man, what the fuck we gonna do?

817
00:41:57,615 --> 00:42:00,323
I've already made preparations
for you guys to crash at my crib

818
00:42:00,384 --> 00:42:02,330
- I knew you'd be back
- Your crib?

819
00:42:02,386 --> 00:42:05,629
We ain't about to stay in your crib!
You see how this shit look?

820
00:42:05,689 --> 00:42:07,532
You got Christmas tree lights

00:42:07,591 --> 00:42:08,797
I know your house look even worse

822
00:42:08,859 --> 00:42:11,533
Baum

823
00:42:19,637 --> 00:42:22,277

Hell yeah. Why you didn't tell us

826
00:42:29,113 --> 00:42:32,890
Oh, you thought when I said
I was stuck here, it was all bad

827
00:42:32,950 --> 00:42:37,126
Hell no. Come on,
I want to show you something

828
00:42:37,187 --> 00:42:39,758
Right over here

829
00:42:42,192 --> 00:42:43,967
You living lovely, Sanchez.

830
00:42:44,028 --> 00:42:45,939
Hey, why don't you

831
00:42:45,996 --> 00:42:49,205
Yeah, put me on some of this thing

832
00:42:49,266 --> 00:42:50,768
- Yeah.

833
00:42:50,834 --> 00:42:52,871
I don't know about that,
but check this out.

834
00:42:56,340 --> 00:42:59,287
- Shat.
- Oh my God

835
00:42:59,343 --> 00:43:01,949
Oh shit

836
00:43:02,012 --> 00:43:05,050
Hush, mamacita
Oh shit, oh shit.

837
00:43:05,115 --> 00:43:06,355
Can-- can I go-- in?

838
00:43:06,417 --> 00:43:08,920
Yeah, go right ahead
and grab a bud to smoke

839
00:43:08,986 --> 00:43:10,966
Oh Lord Jesus

840
00:43:12,890 --> 00:43:16,463
You see, this is what I do

841
00:43:16,527 --> 00:43:18,234
What, smoke weed?

842
00:43:19,663 --> 00:43:23,338
No, I cultivate it

843
00:43:23,400 --> 00:43:25,971
I know what climate it likes

844
00:43:26,036 --> 00:43:28,573
what's the best
source of nourishment?

845
00:43:28,639 --> 00:43:31,381
I know how it grows
I know how it thinks.

846
00:43:31,442 --> 00:43:35,618
I know how it feels.
I am one with the sativa plant

847
00:43:37,715 --> 00:43:41,162
And most importantly I know
when it's time to harvest.

848
00:43:41,218 --> 00:43:44,392
Right, well, I'm trying to
harvest this weed into a blunt

849
00:43:44,455 --> 00:43:46,731
Or a zigzag or something

850
00:43:46,790 --> 00:43:48,997
Right over there in the box

851
00:43:49,059 --> 00:43:51,232
Appreciate it, folk

852
00:43:51,295 --> 00:43:55,072
So that's what I do. I teach
these hillbillies how to grow weed

853
00:43:55,132 --> 00:43:56,805
and they pay me well for it

854
00:43:56,867 --> 00:43:58,676
Why don't you just start
your own crop?

855
00:43:58,736 --> 00:44:00,238
Oh, no way

856
00:44:00,304 --> 00:44:03,979
This mountain is
basically controlled by two families

857
00:44:04,041 --> 00:44:07,887
Two families
of inbred, backwood

858
00:44:07,945 --> 00:44:09,822
animalistic hillbillies

859
00:44:14,118 --> 00:44:17,429
the Gatsfields...

860
00:44:19,189 --> 00:44:20,725
and the McRoys

861
00:44:22,593 --> 00:44:24,595
My crop came up
a few pounds short again!

862
00:44:24,662 --> 00:44:27,302
I know your sons had
something to do with it!

863
00:44:27,364 --> 00:44:31,176
I got my own crop!
I ain't had nothing to do with that

864
00:44:40,878 --> 00:44:43,358
- Shit.
- These two families have been feuding

865
00:44:43,414 --> 00:44:45,894
for years-- decades

866
00:44:45,949 --> 00:44:48,930
First it was moonshine
and now it's chronic.

867
00:44:48,986 --> 00:44:52,058
You got me fucked up. I ain't
going up there with them crackers

868
00:44:54,525 --> 00:44:57,472
See, I told you from the get-go we
should have just started rapping, man

869
00:44:57,528 --> 00:44:59,371
Man, what the fuck
you talking about, man?

870
00:44:59,430 --> 00:45:01,967
It was your whole stupid-ass
idea in the first place, man.

871
00:45:02,032 --> 00:45:05,536
Until I seen all that camping shit.
I knew this was some fucked shit then

872
00:45:05,602 --> 00:45:07,582
It's too late now,
Captain Dipshit.

873
00:45:07,638 --> 00:45:10,551
All right, come on, pendejos,
stop it, all right? Listen,

874
00:45:10,607 --> 00:45:13,816
I got a foolproof plan
to pull it off.

875
00:45:13,877 --> 00:45:16,551
That mean you gonna roll
with us then, right?

876
00:45:16,613 --> 00:45:20,288
- No, I can't
- Why not?

877
00:45:20,350 --> 00:45:22,023
I've been banished from up there

878
00:45:22,086 --> 00:45:24,088
Why is that?

879
00:45:24,154 --> 00:45:26,498
It's a long story,
but I tell you what

880
00:45:26,557 --> 00:45:28,969
I'm gonna send you up there
to meet somebody that I know

881
00:45:29,026 --> 00:45:32,769
Her name is Marie.
She's Jim Gatsfield's only daughter

882
00:45:32,830 --> 00:45:35,777
She works at the only bar up there--

883
00:45:35,833 --> 00:45:37,608
The Last Call

884
00:45:44,808 --> 00:45:47,254
Oh yeah

885
00:45:52,116 --> 00:45:53,823
Hey, what's happening?
How you doing?

886
00:45:53,884 --> 00:45:55,864
- I'm fine.
- Yes, you are

887
00:45:55,919 --> 00:45:58,729
I'm Little Earl.
This is my player partner

888
00:45:58,789 --> 00:46:01,269
- Ray Ray.
- I'm Marie.

889
00:46:01,325 --> 00:46:03,327
Can I get y'all
something to drink?

890
00:46:03,393 --> 00:46:07,341
Yeah, can we get two cognacs
and a chaser on the side?

891
00:46:07,397 --> 00:46:10,378
- Hold the chaser.
- Coming right up

892
00:46:10,434 --> 00:46:13,881
- She's fine.
- What brings you around these parts?

893
00:46:13,937 --> 00:46:17,316
Well, Sanchez sent us
up here, you know,

894
00:46:17,374 --> 00:46:20,514
- to holla at you
- Sanchez?

895
00:46:20,577 --> 00:46:23,114
What would he send you
up here for?

896
00:46:23,180 --> 00:46:25,251
To get some of them trees.

897
00:46:25,315 --> 00:46:27,955
- The what?
- The crops, lady, the crops

898
00:46:32,890 --> 00:46:35,370
How about some drinks, sweetass?

899
00:46:36,960 --> 00:46:38,371
The hell you boys doing in here?

900
00:46:38,428 --> 00:46:40,931
You know you ain't welcome
in Gatsfield's bar.

901
00:46:40,998 --> 00:46:44,104
Me and my brother was sitting up
on the hill drinking whiskey,

902
00:46:44,168 --> 00:46:47,741
when we decided tonight was the night we
was gonna get a piece of that sweet ass.

903
00:46:47,805 --> 00:46:51,582
The only thing y'all gonna get
is a hole in your head.

904
00:46:53,811 --> 00:46:56,189
I get it.
You're only into dark meat

905
00:46:57,514 --> 00:46:59,323
Oh, I got your stuffin', baby

906
00:46:59,383 --> 00:47:01,192
What about you stuff
some Febreze in your mouth?

907
00:47:01,251 --> 00:47:03,492
You talk pretty bold for a nigger

908
00:47:03,554 --> 00:47:06,160
Did you just call me a nigger?
What the-- whoa, shit, he's strong

909
00:47:06,223 --> 00:47:08,396
But not you

910
00:47:08,458 --> 00:47:10,904
Punk, you hit me?
I'm not talking about mine, huh?

911
00:47:10,961 --> 00:47:13,737
- Ooooh.
- Fuckboy!

912
00:47:13,797 --> 00:47:16,710
- You gonna get yours!
- You just got yours, pussy!

913
00:47:16,767 --> 00:47:18,576
FuckboY!

914
00:47:22,739 --> 00:47:24,878
Y'all all right?

915
00:47:27,144 --> 00:47:31,058
I want to thank y'all for saving me

916
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:36,157
Here you go

917
00:47:38,488 --> 00:47:41,799
What the fuck
is going on in here?

918
00:47:45,195 --> 00:47:47,232
Where'd y'all get
them guns from-- T.l.?

919
00:47:47,297 --> 00:47:50,039
Are you motherfuckers

920
00:47:50,100 --> 00:47:53,104
trying to put your
ginormous-sized penises

921
00:47:53,170 --> 00:47:55,081
into our sweet Marie?

922
00:47:55,138 --> 00:47:57,778
- She's a virgin, you know
- No, she ain't.

923
00:47:57,841 --> 00:48:00,082
How do you know?

924
00:48:00,143 --> 00:48:02,521
It was the crop
Just so sweet.

925
00:48:02,579 --> 00:48:04,889
You fucking maggots were
trying to touch my sister

926
00:48:04,948 --> 00:48:06,894
in places that family's
only supposed to?

927
00:48:06,950 --> 00:48:09,430
- What?
- I say we take these two pieces of shit

928
00:48:09,486 --> 00:48:12,467
- outside right now!
- Yeah, and then dump their sorry asses

929
00:48:12,522 --> 00:48:14,468
down there by the river

930
00:48:14,524 --> 00:48:17,004
- Sounds like a plan.
- No, y'all, they helped me

931
00:48:17,060 --> 00:48:19,438
The McRoy boys was here.
That's why I flipped the alarm

932
00:48:19,496 --> 00:48:21,999
And these two
ran 'em up on outta here

933
00:48:22,065 --> 00:48:24,978
Are you shitting me?
These two?

934
00:48:25,035 --> 00:48:26,708
- Yeah.
- I swung first

935
00:48:26,770 --> 00:48:28,943
Beat the crap outta them,
had them running outta here

936
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:30,644
- like a couple of sissies
- "G" shit.

937
00:48:30,707 --> 00:48:33,551
Well, dip my balls
in sweet cream and squat me

938
00:48:33,610 --> 00:48:35,954
- in a kitchen full of kittens
- You're such a poet.

939
00:48:36,013 --> 00:48:38,857
Anybody that fucks
with them McRoys

940
00:48:38,916 --> 00:48:41,419
- are friends of ours
- Absolutely!

941
00:48:41,485 --> 00:48:44,466
- You boys come over for dinner tonight
- Aw, but, Paw,

942
00:48:44,521 --> 00:48:47,627
I wanted to kill them.
I never get to kill nobody

943
00:48:47,691 --> 00:48:49,796
In time, son. In due time

944
00:48:58,902 --> 00:49:00,245
This barbecue's banging, man

945
00:49:00,304 --> 00:49:01,840
- What kind of meat is this?
- Raccoon.

946
00:49:03,473 --> 00:49:05,612
Told ya

947
00:49:05,676 --> 00:49:07,519
Told ya not to eat it.

948
00:49:07,577 --> 00:49:11,616
Say, Earl, why don't you give us
a song from back home?

949
00:49:11,682 --> 00:49:14,629
No, I couldn't play like that

950
00:49:14,685 --> 00:49:16,926
- Y'all ain't ready for me.
- Hey! My old lady wants you

951
00:49:16,987 --> 00:49:20,901
to sing a song, sing a song.
And it better not be Hank Williams

952
00:49:20,958 --> 00:49:24,337
Some songs are
sacrimonius around here

953
00:49:25,762 --> 00:49:28,675
- Spell sacrimonius
- N-l-G-G--

954
00:49:28,732 --> 00:49:30,803
All right, all right, all right

955
00:49:30,867 --> 00:49:32,073
All right

956
00:49:33,904 --> 00:49:36,783
Yeah, pluck them
goddamn strings on that guitar

957
00:49:36,840 --> 00:49:38,979
Let me show you how to get down

958
00:49:41,445 --> 00:49:43,254
Oh, I got one right here
Turn me up.

959
00:49:46,350 --> 00:49:49,797
I stay smoking kush,
she look like Reggie Bush

960
00:49:49,853 --> 00:49:51,389
Y'all look
like some slackers

961
00:49:51,455 --> 00:49:53,401
Oops, I meant some crackers--

962
00:49:53,457 --> 00:49:56,666
Crackers?! You want some crackers,
go up in the house.

963
00:49:56,727 --> 00:49:59,264
- They're in the pantry.
- Behind the moonshine

964
00:49:59,329 --> 00:50:01,969
Shit, that ain't nothing.
I can do better than that

965
00:50:02,032 --> 00:50:05,172
J.R., pluck them strings
you always pluck for me

966
00:50:05,235 --> 00:50:07,442
June Bug, bust a beat

967
00:50:07,504 --> 00:50:10,542
Yo, I chose this life,
this life chose me

968
00:50:12,175 --> 00:50:14,815
I didn't choose this life,
this life chose me

969
00:50:14,878 --> 00:50:17,688
I'm a hick from the sticks,
bitch, don't sneak

970
00:50:17,748 --> 00:50:19,921
I puff a lot of pot,
I drink a lot of booze

971
00:50:19,983 --> 00:50:22,429
Rhyme against me,
I guarantee you'll lose

972
00:50:22,486 --> 00:50:24,727
Don't get me pissed,
tryin' to dis my folks

973
00:50:24,788 --> 00:50:28,201
Next time you try and rap,
wrap you lips around this and choke

974
00:50:31,862 --> 00:50:33,899
That's my son!
Came from my nut

975
00:50:33,964 --> 00:50:36,205
I can tell

976
00:50:39,936 --> 00:50:42,746
So what is it like growing up
here in these mountains?

977
00:50:42,806 --> 00:50:45,218
Well

978
00:50:45,275 --> 00:50:47,118
it's all right, I guess

979
00:50:47,177 --> 00:50:50,215
I much rather would've grown up
somewhere like Atlanta.

980
00:50:50,280 --> 00:50:52,260
- Hmm, yeah
- Yeah.

981
00:50:52,315 --> 00:50:54,226
Tell me what it's like there

982
00:50:54,284 --> 00:50:57,390
I always wanted to know what
it's like to grow up in the city.

983
00:50:57,454 --> 00:51:00,162
I mean,
I grew up there all my life

984
00:51:00,223 --> 00:51:03,636
It's cool I guess,
but it's funny though

985
00:51:03,693 --> 00:51:07,698
When I came out here, I was
just dying to get away from the hood

986
00:51:07,764 --> 00:51:09,801
- From what?
- The hood.

987
00:51:09,866 --> 00:51:11,812
- The city.
- Oh, sorry

988
00:51:14,037 --> 00:51:16,916
No, but like I was saying,
I was just dying to get away

989
00:51:16,973 --> 00:51:18,884
But now that we're here,

990
00:51:18,942 --> 00:51:22,048
I kinda miss it, you know what
I'm saying? Just the little things

991
00:51:22,112 --> 00:51:24,752
The liquor stores, the people,

992
00:51:24,815 --> 00:51:27,591
- the food.
- You didn't like raccoon?

993
00:51:27,651 --> 00:51:29,790
No.
Huh-uh

994
00:51:31,755 --> 00:51:33,325
So

995
00:51:33,390 --> 00:51:35,427
what brought y'all
around these parts?

996
00:51:35,492 --> 00:51:37,768
Sanchez sent us over here
to get some crops.

997
00:51:37,828 --> 00:51:39,671
- We gonna--
- Oh, shh!

998
00:51:41,698 --> 00:51:43,644
You trying to get yourself killed?

999
00:51:49,406 --> 00:51:52,353
Say, Earl,
you want to smoke some?

1000
00:51:52,409 --> 00:51:55,219
Did LeBron mama get fucked?

1001
00:51:57,247 --> 00:51:58,692
Try that shit out

1002
00:51:58,748 --> 00:52:00,989
You ain't said nothing
but a word, man.

1003
00:52:02,519 --> 00:52:04,465
He's gonna fucking do it

1004
00:52:07,090 --> 00:52:09,092
The fuck you sniggling for?!

1005
00:52:09,159 --> 00:52:11,332
That's fucking
crystal meth, dude

1006
00:52:11,394 --> 00:52:13,340
You retard !

1007
00:52:33,049 --> 00:52:36,496
So y'all are here
to snatch some crop?

1008
00:52:36,553 --> 00:52:39,033
Yeah, Sanchez sent us
up here to holla at you about

1009
00:52:39,089 --> 00:52:41,626
snatching up some crops,
so we try and come up.

1010
00:52:41,691 --> 00:52:44,171
You know that'll get you
killed around these parts?

1011
00:52:44,227 --> 00:52:47,231
Pfft, killed?
Niggas face death every day

1012
00:52:47,297 --> 00:52:49,607
living in the hood

1013
00:52:49,666 --> 00:52:51,771
Well, you're a brave man

1014
00:52:51,835 --> 00:52:53,906
I'm just trying to make a credit

1015
00:52:53,970 --> 00:52:56,974
Make what?

1016
00:52:57,040 --> 00:52:59,680
Never mind.
So what's up with the crops?

1017
00:52:59,743 --> 00:53:02,781
Mmm, you sure that's all
you wanna talk about?

1018
00:53:02,846 --> 00:53:05,326
Business first, you know

1019
00:53:05,382 --> 00:53:07,794
- Maybe a little pleasure later
- Mmm.

1020
00:53:07,851 --> 00:53:09,853
Well, how about a little of both?

1021
00:53:09,920 --> 00:53:12,992
- Mmm, well...
- Marie!

1022
00:53:13,056 --> 00:53:15,662
- Yeah?
- Time to come in

1023
00:53:15,725 --> 00:53:18,365
Look, you want
to finish this later?

1024
00:53:18,428 --> 00:53:20,601
- Mm-hmm, mm-hmm
- Yeah, later.

1025
00:53:22,132 --> 00:53:23,440
Marie!

1026
00:53:23,500 --> 00:53:26,003
Here I come

1027
00:53:27,204 --> 00:53:29,047
I'll holla at you in a little bit

1028
00:53:30,307 --> 00:53:32,253
Where do I... sleep

1029
00:53:32,309 --> 00:53:34,220
Mann

1030
00:53:40,016 --> 00:53:42,519
Don't put that thumb in my ass

1031
00:54:01,171 --> 00:54:02,912
Where are they going?

1032
00:54:02,973 --> 00:54:05,249
Oh, they're all going on
to work on the crops.

1033
00:54:06,443 --> 00:54:07,922
- Earl.
- It's a curable disease

1034
00:54:07,978 --> 00:54:10,185
- Oh, come on, Earl, get up.
- It's a curable disease, baby

1035
00:54:10,247 --> 00:54:11,487
Get up!
They're going to get the crops

1036
00:54:11,548 --> 00:54:12,959
- Who?
- Let's go, man. Come on

1037
00:54:13,016 --> 00:54:15,257
Don't forget your lunch

1038
00:54:15,318 --> 00:54:18,299
Oh, you flirt.
You old flirt!

1039
00:54:18,355 --> 00:54:21,097
There you go

1040
00:54:21,157 --> 00:54:23,660
- Scoot!
- Don't look at my booty

1041
00:54:23,727 --> 00:54:25,468
How can I help it?

1042
00:54:30,867 --> 00:54:33,939
- We got a big day ahead of us, bro
- It's just weed, man.

1043
00:54:34,004 --> 00:54:35,483
Yeah

1044
00:54:39,843 --> 00:54:41,516
Yeah, let's go

1045
00:54:41,578 --> 00:54:43,251
- Let's roll, buddy
- You're strong.

1046
00:54:43,313 --> 00:54:45,520
- Aw, no, shit.
- What's up, baby? You good?

1047
00:54:45,582 --> 00:54:48,188
Everybody that voted
for Barack Obama?

1048
00:54:48,251 --> 00:54:50,094
Get outta my truck.
That means you two

1049
00:54:50,153 --> 00:54:51,962
- We got work to do
- I can't vote.

1050
00:54:52,022 --> 00:54:54,502
We don't mind working, though
We can work all day.

1051
00:54:54,557 --> 00:54:57,834
- I like to earn my keep
- Paw said you can't go

1052
00:54:57,894 --> 00:55:00,340
So I suggest you two get
the fuck outta this truck

1053
00:55:00,397 --> 00:55:02,877
before I skin one of you
city motherfuckers.

1054
00:55:02,932 --> 00:55:04,969
- I do not need a haircut
- All right, damn, man.

1055
00:55:05,035 --> 00:55:06,105
All right, all right

1056
00:55:06,169 --> 00:55:07,671
I know when we're not wanted

1057
00:55:07,737 --> 00:55:09,341
- Let's roll.
- Yeah, I can tell when we ain't wanted

1058
00:55:09,406 --> 00:55:12,148
It's a damn shame. Okay

1059
00:55:12,208 --> 00:55:13,687
Yeehaw

1060
00:55:22,218 --> 00:55:24,596
- Fucking bite me!
- Oh, Lord!

1061
00:55:24,654 --> 00:55:26,827
Why he do that?

1062
00:55:26,890 --> 00:55:29,632
His daddy must be
running up in here.

1063
00:55:31,261 --> 00:55:33,070
Man, this really sucks

1064
00:55:33,129 --> 00:55:36,042
We ain't got no weed,
we ain't got no money

1065
00:55:36,099 --> 00:55:38,375
And on top of that,
I had to see this white man's ass

1066
00:55:38,435 --> 00:55:40,073
that look like
an empty eye socket

1067
00:55:40,136 --> 00:55:42,548
I'm gone.
Man, I'm tired of this

1068
00:55:42,605 --> 00:55:45,211
- Where-- where you going?
- I gotta go boo-boo.

1069
00:55:51,014 --> 00:55:53,460
Now what the fuck are we gonna do?

1070
00:55:56,152 --> 00:55:57,426
Hey, come on

1071
00:55:57,487 --> 00:55:59,398
Game

1072
00:56:03,159 --> 00:56:05,332
The hell this fool go?

1073
00:56:05,395 --> 00:56:08,205
Hey! You left me

1074
00:56:09,799 --> 00:56:12,507
Yodelayheehoo-hoo.

1075
00:56:12,569 --> 00:56:15,573
Hi there, sexy

1076
00:56:15,638 --> 00:56:18,448
Tell me, what would you do

1077
00:56:18,508 --> 00:56:20,579
for some of this?

1078
00:56:22,512 --> 00:56:24,253
- Hmm?
- Unfortunately anything

1079
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:27,022
Oh, that's kinda what I thought

1080
00:56:27,083 --> 00:56:30,826
Won't you follow Ma?
Come on now.

1081
00:56:30,887 --> 00:56:33,629
Don't be shy
Come on.

1082
00:56:33,690 --> 00:56:35,692
- I wish I was shy
- Whoo!

1083
00:56:35,759 --> 00:56:37,397
Oooh!

1084
00:56:38,661 --> 00:56:40,766
- Hey, where are we going?
- You'll see.

1085
00:56:42,565 --> 00:56:44,738
Mam

1086
00:56:44,801 --> 00:56:47,281
all timid and shy

1087
00:56:47,337 --> 00:56:51,479
You're just a little
cute little baby is what you are

1088
00:56:51,541 --> 00:56:54,647
- Don't you want to smoke?
- Yes, now. Can I do it right now?

1089
00:56:54,711 --> 00:56:56,349
- Huh-uh-uh.
- I need it right now

1090
00:56:56,413 --> 00:56:58,757
No no no.
No love, no bud

1091
00:56:58,815 --> 00:57:00,817
Can we get this over with?

1092
00:57:00,884 --> 00:57:04,627
That's just what Paw said
on our wedding night, you poet

1093
00:57:04,687 --> 00:57:08,567
Come on now.
Slip them panties off

1094
00:57:08,625 --> 00:57:10,901
I'm so stupid!

1095
00:57:10,960 --> 00:57:12,997
These are not panties neither

1096
00:57:13,062 --> 00:57:14,735
- Oh really?
- These are briefs!

1097
00:57:14,798 --> 00:57:17,438
Oh my goodness,
now you're all the man, aren't you?

1098
00:57:17,500 --> 00:57:20,538
Oh my! Look, I was right
You are packing.

1099
00:57:20,603 --> 00:57:23,607
I'm gonna have to take
my teeth out for this.

1100
00:57:23,673 --> 00:57:25,778
Teeth?

1101
00:57:28,178 --> 00:57:29,748
Ahh-- Oh

1102
00:57:29,813 --> 00:57:31,486
Oh-- oh my God

1103
00:57:31,548 --> 00:57:32,993
Oh-

1104
00:57:33,049 --> 00:57:35,188
This weed--

1105
00:57:35,251 --> 00:57:37,197
this weed right here
is the bomb, man.

1106
00:57:37,253 --> 00:57:40,257
- Your pops grow this shit right here?
- Mm-hmm.

1107
00:57:40,323 --> 00:57:43,031
Yeah, I got it out
of a secret stash.

1108
00:57:43,092 --> 00:57:46,369
Secret stash?
All the weed they growing up there,

1109
00:57:46,429 --> 00:57:48,409
why they don't just give you some?

1110
00:57:48,465 --> 00:57:51,344
Give"?

1111
00:57:51,401 --> 00:57:55,213
No, sugar.
They don't give me anything

1112
00:57:55,271 --> 00:57:57,877
Shit.
Thank you

1113
00:57:57,941 --> 00:58:00,649
The only time they
pay attention to me

1114
00:58:00,710 --> 00:58:03,247
is when the McRoy boys
are bothering me

1115
00:58:03,313 --> 00:58:05,759
or if they want me to sleep
in the bed with them

1116
00:58:05,815 --> 00:58:07,886
so they can grope
all over me and shit

1117
00:58:07,951 --> 00:58:10,932
- Your father too?
- My father, my mother, my brothers,

1118
00:58:10,987 --> 00:58:13,194
the uncles, cousins--
all of them, shit.

1119
00:58:13,256 --> 00:58:15,327
- That's how family does
- That's fucked up.

1120
00:58:15,391 --> 00:58:16,961
- Pilot?
- Yes.

1121
00:58:17,026 --> 00:58:19,768
All right, we want to make sure
we fly nice and low. Make sure we get

1122
00:58:19,829 --> 00:58:21,968
- the faces of these bastards
- Roger.

1123
00:58:34,744 --> 00:58:37,054
Looks pretty good

1124
00:58:37,113 --> 00:58:40,287
Think I'll leave it
out here another week or so

1125
00:58:50,260 --> 00:58:52,035
All right,
get ready, get ready

1126
00:59:00,436 --> 00:59:02,347
You see that sumbitch
taking pictures?

1127
00:59:02,405 --> 00:59:04,043
Who was it?

1128
00:59:04,107 --> 00:59:05,552
I don't know

1129
00:59:05,608 --> 00:59:08,646
So we gotta harvest this
sooner than I thought.

1130
00:59:16,586 --> 00:59:19,157
Now you know you was wrong
for having me in that boat today

1131
00:59:19,222 --> 00:59:21,133
- Ah, you all right.
- You know black folks

1132
00:59:21,190 --> 00:59:22,498
and water don't get along too good

1133
00:59:22,559 --> 00:59:24,402
What if I could've drown?

1134
00:59:24,460 --> 00:59:26,997
Oh, I guess I would have had
to give you mouth-to-mouth.

1135
00:59:27,063 --> 00:59:28,770
Oh shit,
you can do that anyway

1136
00:59:31,000 --> 00:59:34,413
Maybe we should hurry up and get back
before my dad and them get home.

1137
00:59:34,470 --> 00:59:36,780
- Shit, let's do it
- All right.

1138
00:59:44,814 --> 00:59:47,624
- Oh yeah yeah
- Mmm...

1139
00:59:52,121 --> 00:59:54,829
What? What's up, fellas?
Hey, what's happening?

1140
00:59:54,891 --> 00:59:57,667
You took a wrong fucking
turn somewhere, buddy.

1141
00:59:57,727 --> 01:00:00,401
Uh well, we just took
a cruise in a boat.

1142
01:00:00,463 --> 01:00:02,704
And we was headed
back up the hill

1143
01:00:02,765 --> 01:00:04,711
and we about
to bounce right now

1144
01:00:04,767 --> 01:00:07,577
- No, you ain't going nowhere
- Hey look, y'all,

1145
01:00:07,637 --> 01:00:10,982
- we're Gatsfields.
- I don't give a pig's ass who you are

1146
01:00:11,040 --> 01:00:14,044
Strip

1147
01:00:16,279 --> 01:00:18,850
Hey, pump your brakes there,
Girls Gone Wild.

1148
01:00:18,915 --> 01:00:20,622
Just him

1149
01:00:20,683 --> 01:00:23,493
- Oh no no no, hell no
- Strip!

1150
01:00:23,553 --> 01:00:26,363
Man, okay, wait a minute, man
Damn, hold up, hold up.

1151
01:00:28,324 --> 01:00:29,860
I can't believe this shit, man

1152
01:00:29,926 --> 01:00:31,963
What y'all gonna do, man?

1153
01:00:32,028 --> 01:00:33,769
We're gonna fuck you

1154
01:00:33,830 --> 01:00:36,106
and make your little
girlfriend here watch

1155
01:00:36,165 --> 01:00:39,476
Yeah, I'll make you squeal like a pig!

1156
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,811
Oh no, wait a minute, man
Hold up. One thing.

1157
01:00:41,871 --> 01:00:44,181
One thing before you do that, man,
let me just do one thing.

1158
01:00:44,240 --> 01:00:47,119
Let me hit this one time
and you can do whatever, man

1159
01:00:47,176 --> 01:00:49,486
Just one time.
Just let me hit this

1160
01:01:34,390 --> 01:01:36,666
They ain't shit.
Alls I need is some weed

1161
01:01:36,726 --> 01:01:40,697
I'll show them motherfuckers
my "Blunted Master" technique

1162
01:01:42,331 --> 01:01:44,277
I 9011 you

1163
01:01:44,333 --> 01:01:48,179
Fuck me?
No, fuck y'all

1164
01:01:52,475 --> 01:01:55,319
- You know what I'm saying?
- Yeah.

1165
01:01:57,213 --> 01:01:59,215
Hey, where the hell you been?!

1166
01:01:59,282 --> 01:02:00,852
Come on, man
Chill out, man.

1167
01:02:00,917 --> 01:02:02,590
You're carrying
around picnic baskets

1168
01:02:02,652 --> 01:02:04,359
Old sucker for lunch--
got you sprung.

1169
01:02:04,420 --> 01:02:06,263
- Oh man, chill out, man
- Oh, my ass.

1170
01:02:06,322 --> 01:02:08,893
Come on, man.
I'm out there with bugs and shit

1171
01:02:08,958 --> 01:02:11,438
- Man, what's happening?
- Man, whatever.

1172
01:02:11,494 --> 01:02:13,804
Marie, where the hell
is the goddamn weed at?

1173
01:02:13,863 --> 01:02:15,240
Shh.
Hey, chill out, man

1174
01:02:15,298 --> 01:02:17,744
I got this under control.
You know what I'm saying?

1175
01:02:17,800 --> 01:02:19,245
We leaving tonight

1176
01:02:19,302 --> 01:02:21,714
And Marie-
she going with us

1177
01:02:21,771 --> 01:02:24,377
We ain't going nowhere
with this basic-ass hill rat.

1178
01:02:24,440 --> 01:02:26,750
- No?
- She look regular as hell in the city

1179
01:02:26,809 --> 01:02:29,790
Well, I know where all
the booby traps are, so fuck your face

1180
01:02:29,846 --> 01:02:31,621
- Fuck your face!
- Fuck your face!

1181
01:02:31,681 --> 01:02:33,251
- Fuck your face!
- Fuck your mother's face!

1182
01:02:33,316 --> 01:02:34,989
Fuck your face,
waffle-house, teeth-ass bitch!

1183
01:02:35,051 --> 01:02:37,725
Fuck your damn face. Fuck your
goatee and your big eyebrows

1184
01:02:37,787 --> 01:02:39,858
- and fuck your little-ass neck!
- Chill out, chill out.

1185
01:02:39,922 --> 01:02:42,129
Look here, you gotta pick
either me or her. Make a choice

1186
01:02:42,191 --> 01:02:44,262
Oh, Earl,

1187
01:02:44,327 --> 01:02:46,432
I just wanted to thank you

1188
01:02:46,496 --> 01:02:49,340
for all that plumbing work
you did for me

1189
01:02:49,398 --> 01:02:51,002
this morning.

1190
01:02:51,067 --> 01:02:53,377
You really cleaned out my pipes

1191
01:02:53,436 --> 01:02:55,575
I'll step in any booby trap
you want me to. Let's go.

1192
01:02:55,638 --> 01:02:57,481
Let's go.
I'm ready to die

1193
01:03:27,203 --> 01:03:28,409
Watch out

1194
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:33,309
- Who the fuck is this?
- They only guard it like this

1195
01:03:33,376 --> 01:03:37,119
- when it's a close call
- Close call like what?

1196
01:03:37,180 --> 01:03:40,161
Pot snatchers or the police

1197
01:03:41,384 --> 01:03:43,864
So they gonna shoot it out
with the fucking police?

1198
01:03:43,920 --> 01:03:47,163
No, they got flamethrower things

1199
01:03:47,223 --> 01:03:48,759
at each corner of the crops

1200
01:03:48,825 --> 01:03:50,634
- That's some smart-ass hillbillies
- Mm-hmm.

1201
01:03:50,693 --> 01:03:53,230
Man, I'm glad you're
so impressed with their criminality

1202
01:03:53,296 --> 01:03:55,572
But now how the fuck
we supposed to get this weed?

1203
01:03:55,631 --> 01:03:58,111
I guess we're gonna have to
come up with another plan.

1204
01:04:00,703 --> 01:04:03,377
Oh shit, come on
Come on, nigga.

1205
01:04:07,677 --> 01:04:10,283
See, Ray and Earl
or even I didn't realize

1206
01:04:10,346 --> 01:04:12,383
we had picked
the worst possible time

1207
01:04:12,448 --> 01:04:14,052
to make a move

1208
01:04:14,116 --> 01:04:17,359
The DEA agents were hot
on the Gatsfield's tail

1209
01:04:17,420 --> 01:04:20,196
and preparing to make a bust

1210
01:04:20,256 --> 01:04:22,258
All right, ladies and gentlemen,

1211
01:04:22,325 --> 01:04:24,396
- and Deputy Dick
- Dan.

1212
01:04:24,460 --> 01:04:27,600
Whatever. We are gonna send
our ground troops

1213
01:04:27,663 --> 01:04:30,075
on the ground right here,
while simultaneously

1214
01:04:30,132 --> 01:04:32,840
choppers will be landing
here on the field.

1215
01:04:32,902 --> 01:04:34,973
- Okay?
- What day are we doing this?

1216
01:04:35,037 --> 01:04:37,039
Tomorrow

1217
01:04:37,106 --> 01:04:39,086
- Now--
- Tomorrow's bowling night

1218
01:04:39,141 --> 01:04:41,621
- Can we do it Thursday?
- Deputy Dan?

1219
01:04:41,677 --> 01:04:43,884
You're not stuck
on stupid, are you?

1220
01:04:43,946 --> 01:04:47,086
You're dangling on dummy
Shut the hell up.

1221
01:04:47,149 --> 01:04:49,561
Where the hell did you
find this guy?

1222
01:04:49,619 --> 01:04:51,394
Are we clear?
Any questions?

1223
01:04:51,454 --> 01:04:53,331
What's he mean by that?

1224
01:04:54,857 --> 01:04:56,359
All right, look, y'all

1225
01:04:56,425 --> 01:04:58,405
- we gonna come out right here
- Uh-huh.

1226
01:04:58,461 --> 01:05:01,670
Start here and we gonna come out
somewhere about right here.

1227
01:05:01,731 --> 01:05:05,042
And we gonna be off on the freeway
and then after that we home free.

1228
01:05:05,101 --> 01:05:06,205
- Cool.
- Okay?

1229
01:05:06,269 --> 01:05:07,646
- Yeah yeah
- Good.

1230
01:05:07,703 --> 01:05:10,479
That shit sound good,
but so did your other plan

1231
01:05:10,539 --> 01:05:12,985
that got fucked up.

1232
01:05:13,042 --> 01:05:16,251
Look,baby,
this here is foolproof

1233
01:05:16,312 --> 01:05:19,020
That's what your mouth say
I don't believe that shit.

1234
01:05:19,081 --> 01:05:21,288
Well, this is right
this time, I promise

1235
01:05:21,350 --> 01:05:23,660
- I know it for a fact.
- Hell, all your shit always-

1236
01:05:23,719 --> 01:05:25,596
Shut the hell up!

1237
01:05:25,655 --> 01:05:28,636
Get your girl, man. I ain't buying that
fucking shit. You know how I get.

1238
01:05:28,691 --> 01:05:30,398
- Carry your ass
- I slap bitches.

1239
01:05:30,459 --> 01:05:31,904
- Get him.
- Man, you better get your girl

1240
01:05:31,961 --> 01:05:33,099
before I Chris Brown her ass

1241
01:05:33,162 --> 01:05:35,369
Chill out, man.
Let's concentrate on the weed

1242
01:05:35,431 --> 01:05:38,810
Man, you concentrate on checking her,
man. I'm tired of all this shit.

1243
01:05:38,868 --> 01:05:41,712
- She know what she doing.
- Fuck you and motherfuck you!

1244
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:08,004
You know what?
I thought about it, I'm a chill

1245
01:06:08,064 --> 01:06:09,543
- That's cool
- I'm a chill.

1246
01:06:09,598 --> 01:06:10,702
Cool. All right now

1247
01:06:10,766 --> 01:06:12,803
I take my fuck back from you,
but still fuck you.

1248
01:06:12,868 --> 01:06:14,711
- When are we gonna do this?
- Tomorrow morning.

1249
01:06:14,770 --> 01:06:16,340
I heard my daddy and them
saying they was

1250
01:06:16,405 --> 01:06:18,407

We're outta here.

1251
01:06:18,474 --> 01:06:19,976
Shit, tomorrow morning
it is then.

1252
01:06:20,042 --> 01:06:22,750
Yeah.
Uh-huh

1253
01:06:22,812 --> 01:06:24,291
Mm-hmm.

1254
01:06:24,347 --> 01:06:26,020
You a sucker-for-love nigga, man

1255
01:07:32,314 --> 01:07:34,885
- What are you doing here, Marie?
- It's the McRoy boys.

1256
01:07:34,950 --> 01:07:36,987
They got my daddy
and them down at the house

1257
01:07:37,053 --> 01:07:39,761

1258
01:07:41,957 --> 01:07:44,801
Come on, y'all. We don't have
enough time. Come on, hurry up

1259
01:07:50,199 --> 01:07:52,770
What the hell are you doing?
Who's guarding the crops?

1260
01:07:52,835 --> 01:07:56,009
Marie's guarding the crops. She said
the McRoys are back at the house.

1261
01:07:56,072 --> 01:07:58,643
What?
Ain't no McRoys at the house

1262
01:07:58,707 --> 01:08:01,313
That little sweetass is lying
Let's get back up the hill!

1263
01:08:01,377 --> 01:08:03,288
Yeah, finally going
to get to kill somebody!

1264
01:08:03,345 --> 01:08:05,120
Center mass, Lil June,

1265
01:08:05,181 --> 01:08:06,785
In between the nipple
and the knee.

1266
01:08:06,849 --> 01:08:09,557
Hey, y'all come on

1267
01:08:09,618 --> 01:08:12,326

1268
01:08:12,388 --> 01:08:14,629
Ugh, God!

01:08:16,759 --> 01:08:19,069
No, come on, y'all! Come on!

1270
01:08:21,030 --> 01:08:22,202

01:08:56,098 --> 01:08:58,544

1281
01:08:58,601 --> 01:09:02,845
Now listen, maybe we can come
to some sort of comprise.

1282
01:09:02,905 --> 01:09:04,748
It's compromise,
you dumb fuck.

1283
01:09:04,807 --> 01:09:07,253
And we ain't coming to no compromise
We taking all this shit.

01:09:07,309 --> 01:09:09,983
We're gonna take all
your kids from you, bitch

1285
01:09:10,045 --> 01:09:11,991
I'm afraid I can't let you do that

1286
01:09:12,047 --> 01:09:14,391
- All right, all right, all right!
- Whoa whoa whoa!

1287
01:09:14,450 --> 01:09:15,724
- Whoa whoa whoa

1288
01:09:15,784 --> 01:09:18,230
Listen, you can take the pot,

- No, that ain't going down.

1292
01:09:25,094 --> 01:09:27,199
Oh yeah, she goes down a lot

1293
01:09:27,263 --> 01:09:28,708

01:09:35,671 --> 01:09:37,947

01:09:38,007 --> 01:09:40,214

1298
01:09:40,276 --> 01:09:42,586
Hey, it is what it is, man

01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,352

That was fun

1304
01:10:05,134 --> 01:10:08,741
I'm glad you had so much fun,
cause here these motherfuckers come

1305
01:10:08,804 --> 01:10:10,249
- Huh?
- Oh shit!

1306
01:10:29,425 --> 01:10:30,802
You know, we--

1307
01:10:30,859 --> 01:10:33,465
we should be getting the hell up
outta here. You know?

1308
01:10:33,529 --> 01:10:35,736
- Yeah.
- What the hell are we doing here?

1309
01:10:35,798 --> 01:10:38,210
You know what I'm saying?
You know what I want to do?

1310
01:10:38,267 --> 01:10:41,009
- Can we land this thing over at KFC?
- Sure.

1311
01:10:41,070 --> 01:10:43,744
Yeah!
You're my dawg, dawg!

1312
01:10:46,642 --> 01:10:49,816
Hey, if a tree is burning

1313
01:10:49,878 --> 01:10:52,324

1314
01:10:52,381 --> 01:10:54,190

1315
01:10:56,185 --> 01:10:57,630
- That's deep, man
- Right?

1316
01:10:57,686 --> 01:10:59,563
I never thought about that

1317
01:11:09,732 --> 01:11:12,303
Man, I can't believe

1318
01:11:12,368 --> 01:11:14,644
outta all the bullshit-ass
trucks you would get,

1319
01:11:14,703 --> 01:11:17,240
- you'd get the one that'd break down
- Oh, fuck you, Earl.

1320
01:11:17,306 --> 01:11:19,752
At least you got
your goddamn weed, babe

1321
01:11:19,808 --> 01:11:21,617
Yeah, we got the weed, but shit!

1322
01:11:21,677 --> 01:11:23,384
We ain't got no way
to get home now.

1323
01:11:23,445 --> 01:11:25,288
- How the fuck we gonna get home?
- Use your thumb.

1324
01:11:25,347 --> 01:11:26,883
Or your mouth.
Maybe that's more like--

1325
01:11:26,949 --> 01:11:28,622
That ain't gonna
get us nowhere-- nowhere

1326
01:11:28,684 --> 01:11:30,186
- Fuck you, fuck him
- Fuck her.

1327
01:11:30,252 --> 01:11:33,495
- Hey, want to get lifted?
- Daddy! Hey, Daddy!

1328
01:11:33,555 --> 01:11:35,592
- Daddy?
- See, honey, I told you

1329
01:11:35,658 --> 01:11:37,501
I was gonna get you
outta here someday.

1330
01:11:37,559 --> 01:11:39,038
Man, what's going on?

1331
01:11:39,094 --> 01:11:40,767
Why you didn't tell us
this was your daughter?

1332
01:11:40,829 --> 01:11:43,309
Yeah, that's how I got stuck here

1333
01:11:43,365 --> 01:11:45,811
I couldn't leave here
without my baby.

1334
01:11:45,868 --> 01:11:48,405
Yes! Told y'all I could
get y'all a ride.

1335
01:11:48,470 --> 01:11:51,349
Come on, get in.
I'll tell you all about it

1336
01:11:51,407 --> 01:11:54,286
- on the way out.
- You're hiding a ton of things

1337
01:12:03,252 --> 01:12:05,755
Look here,
that's one hell of a story, man

1338
01:12:05,821 --> 01:12:07,266
Is it true?

1339
01:12:07,323 --> 01:12:10,304
- 100%.
- Damn!

1340
01:12:10,359 --> 01:12:13,670
So I know they made it back
to the hood with all that sweet sativa

1341
01:12:13,729 --> 01:12:16,232
and flipped that shit,
now they sitting on fat

1342
01:12:16,298 --> 01:12:18,505
Hey, I know they got cheese, man

1343
01:12:18,567 --> 01:12:21,173
No, they flat broke, man
They spent it

1344
01:12:21,236 --> 01:12:23,978
on lowriders and hookers.
How much of this do you want?

1345
01:12:24,039 --> 01:12:25,882
Of this shit right here?

1346
01:12:25,941 --> 01:12:28,945
Man, I want all of this
motherfucking shit, nigga

1347
01:12:29,011 --> 01:12:30,854
Kick that in, right now

This for those who are
really thinking they focused

1360
01:13:01,343 --> 01:13:04,119
Never up the nose,
dipping cigarettes is bogus

1361
01:13:04,179 --> 01:13:06,625
All we need, we roll it
inhale and hold it

1362
01:13:06,682 --> 01:13:09,322
Exhale, 'cause hell,
all we need, we smoke it

1363
01:13:10,719 --> 01:13:13,495
All you need is weed
and nothing else

1364
01:13:13,555 --> 01:13:16,058
Sit back and roll one
and enjoy yourself

1365
01:13:16,125 --> 01:13:18,799

Yeah yeah yeah

1367
01:13:21,096 --> 01:13:24,236
All you need is weed
and nothing else

1368
01:13:24,299 --> 01:13:27,109
Sit back and roll one
and enjoy yourself

1369
01:13:27,169 --> 01:13:29,911
All them other narcotics
fuck up your health

1370
01:13:29,972 --> 01:13:31,918
Yeah yeah yeah

1371
01:13:31,974 --> 01:13:34,352
I got an old school partner,
he smoke crack

1372
01:13:34,410 --> 01:13:37,050
He's fierce with the lyrics,
but he probably won't come back

1373
01:13:37,112 --> 01:13:39,991
To the studio, because he
might be out creepin'

1374
01:13:40,048 --> 01:13:42,619
In somebody's house, trying
to clean 'em out, thievin'

1375
01:13:42,684 --> 01:13:45,460
I know another nigga,
he smoke fry

1376
01:13:45,521 --> 01:13:47,523
He always cry,
but we don't know why

1377
01:13:47,589 --> 01:13:50,763
We tried to give him advice,
but he wouldn't take it

1378
01:13:50,826 --> 01:13:53,432
Saw him last Wednesday
walking down the street beggin

1379
01:13:53,495 --> 01:13:56,533
My homeboy used to holla,
but he's out there snorting powder

1380
01:13:56,598 --> 01:13:58,942
Hour after hour,
but he'd never take a shower

1381
01:13:59,001 --> 01:14:01,709
And I guess it's cool
if you can handle your thing

1382
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:04,512
But it's kinda fucked up
if you dismantle your brain

1383
01:14:04,573 --> 01:14:07,144
Like my nigga poking his
veins with tracks in his arm

1384
01:14:07,209 --> 01:14:10,088
He ain't real cool,
but he's always calm

1385
01:14:10,145 --> 01:14:12,591
He disappear real quick
and shoot up one D

1386
01:14:12,648 --> 01:14:15,219
I tried to pass him the weed
the nigga asleep.

1387
