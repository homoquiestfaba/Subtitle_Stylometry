1
00:01:23,000 --> 00:01:27,790
Arthur?

2
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,308
where's he gone to this time?

3
00:01:32,480 --> 00:01:34,311
And the dog's disappeared too!

4
00:01:34,680 --> 00:01:36,079
Alfred!?!

5
00:01:36,800 --> 00:01:39,633
Oh yes, you'll see, he be a great guard dog!

6
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:44,435
Alfred!
I wonder what exactly it is he'll be guarding!

7
00:01:51,120 --> 00:01:53,873
If you could at least answer when I call!

8
00:01:59,880 --> 00:02:01,154
Arthur...?

9
00:02:02,080 --> 00:02:02,592
Arthur?!

10
00:02:02,640 --> 00:02:03,470
Help! An attack!

11
00:02:03,520 --> 00:02:04,316
Men, come to my aid!

12
00:02:04,360 --> 00:02:04,997
Calm down!

13
00:02:05,080 --> 00:02:07,150
It's me! Granny!

14
00:02:07,240 --> 00:02:09,435
Sorry! I was in Africa!

15
00:02:09,480 --> 00:02:11,755
I can tell! Did you have a good trip?

16
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:13,870
Fantastic...! I was in a tribe with Granpa!
Look!

17
00:02:14,040 --> 00:02:17,237
Grandpa painted a canvas
that he placed in a circle

18
00:02:17,320 --> 00:02:20,039
that way the animals pace round and round it

19
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,956
but can't find us. It's like we're invisible.

20
00:02:21,080 --> 00:02:24,755
Invisible, but not unsmelable!
Did you have your bath this morning?

21
00:02:24,800 --> 00:02:26,313
I was on my way when I found this book!

22
00:02:26,360 --> 00:02:26,837
Hmm hmm!

23
00:02:26,880 --> 00:02:27,790
It's incredible!

24
00:02:27,880 --> 00:02:30,633
It's all the inventions Grandpa made
for the isolated tribes.

25
00:02:30,680 --> 00:02:33,148
Yes. He was more interested in African tribes
than he was his own!

26
00:02:33,200 --> 00:02:35,077
Look! He dug a super deep well

27
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:37,839
and invented a whole irrigation system
out of bamboo poles.

28
00:02:37,880 --> 00:02:41,555
You know it wasn't Grandpa who invented
that, it was the Romans.

29
00:02:41,880 --> 00:02:43,711
They called them viaducts.

30
00:02:43,760 --> 00:02:46,433
The Romans? I never heard of that tribe!

31
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:50,758
Oh, it's a very old tribe
the leader was called Caesar.

32
00:02:50,880 --> 00:02:51,915
Like the salad?

33
00:02:51,960 --> 00:02:53,678
Yes, like the salad.

34
00:02:53,800 --> 00:02:56,997
Put that book back where you got it
we have to go shopping!

35
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,156
Granny, please
can I drive on the way back?

36
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:04,315
I don't know, Arthur, we'll see.

37
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:07,033
Oh, please, Grandpa would always

38
00:03:07,080 --> 00:03:08,957
Grandpa's not here, and I'm in charge

39
00:03:28,240 --> 00:03:29,309
Goody day, Mrs. Suchot!

40
00:03:29,680 --> 00:03:30,829
Oh, officer, hello!

41
00:03:30,880 --> 00:03:31,869
Always a pleasure to see you in town.

42
00:03:31,920 --> 00:03:33,956
Thank you, Officer
always a pleasure to see you too.

43
00:03:34,000 --> 00:03:35,069
Good day, Officer!

44
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:35,791
Good day.

45
00:03:36,200 --> 00:03:38,920
Arthur, um, here, here's the shopping list,

46
00:03:38,955 --> 00:03:41,673
and I'm, I'm just gonna run across
the street for five minutes

47
00:03:41,760 --> 00:03:43,876
so I'll meet you at the checkout counter.

48
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:44,955
Can I buy some straws?

49
00:03:45,000 --> 00:03:46,433
Yeah, as many as you like.

50
00:03:53,080 --> 00:03:54,115
Did he follow you?

51
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,400
I don't think so

52
00:03:55,435 --> 00:03:56,992
Perfect! Perfect!

53
00:03:58,080 --> 00:03:59,559
There! It's all there.

54
00:03:59,600 --> 00:04:02,034
Perfect, this is wonderful thank you so much
What do I owe you?

55
00:04:02,080 --> 00:04:04,036
Are you crazy, nothing! Nothing at all!

56
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,877
Now, get going before he catches you.

57
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:08,231
I'm speechless, I don't know how thank you!

58
00:04:08,280 --> 00:04:10,077
By letting me participate!
Nothing could make me happier!

59
00:04:10,120 --> 00:04:11,235
Now, get going!

60
00:04:11,280 --> 00:04:12,235
Thanks so much.

61
00:04:12,320 --> 00:04:13,878
I'm counting on you to let me
know how it went?!

62
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:15,751
I will, I'll call you tomorrow!

63
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:16,551
Talk to you tomorrow

64
00:04:16,680 --> 00:04:17,317
Bye then.

65
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,270
Bye.

66
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,792
Oh Arthur! Arthur, no no no it's fine.

67
00:04:25,840 --> 00:04:27,512
You go off and play.
Go off while it's still light...!

68
00:04:27,640 --> 00:04:28,240
Sure?

69
00:04:28,275 --> 00:04:28,877
Absolutely.

70
00:04:28,920 --> 00:04:29,397
Thanks Granny!

71
00:04:29,440 --> 00:04:30,350
Sure.

72
00:04:34,840 --> 00:04:37,832
Yes! Yes! World champion!

73
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,359
Alfred!

74
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,079
Watch carefully, Alfred!

75
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:51,514
You are about to witness the invention
of the largest irrigation system
in the county.

76
00:04:51,560 --> 00:05:02,596
Bigger than Grandpa's
better than Cesar's.
This is Arthur's invention!

77
00:05:13,040 --> 00:05:14,268
Perfect!

78
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,397
By the grace of God!

79
00:05:31,400 --> 00:05:33,311
Alfred, congratulations!

80
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:37,115
It's a remarkable invention
that'll go down in history!
Believe me!

81
00:05:37,160 --> 00:05:38,832
Arthur! Telephone!

82
00:05:39,000 --> 00:05:40,638
You'll have to excuse me!

83
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:43,274
Probably the uh
president calling to congratulate me.

84
00:05:44,520 --> 00:05:46,640
Hey! I built an irrigation system like Cesar's!

85
00:05:46,675 --> 00:05:47,675
Now the radishes will grow twice as fast!

86
00:05:48,320 --> 00:05:51,153
Huh? Is this my honey pie?
Who is this Seesher?

87
00:05:51,400 --> 00:05:52,276
One of Grandpa's colleagues...

88
00:05:52,520 --> 00:05:55,114
but I followed Grandpa's blueprints
and it works really well!

89
00:05:55,360 --> 00:05:57,874
I hope you can get here before nighttime
so you can see it...

90
00:05:57,920 --> 00:05:58,750
where are you now?

91
00:05:58,800 --> 00:06:01,234
Um... well, we're still in the city, Arthur.

92
00:06:01,640 --> 00:06:04,359
Huh?! Oh. Well...
I guess you'll see it tomorrow morning then?

93
00:06:04,400 --> 00:06:07,597
Um, No
we're not going to able to make it Arthur

94
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,398
but even though we can't be there,

95
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:12,238
we wanted to
tell you that we're thinking of you

96
00:06:12,280 --> 00:06:14,475
Because... today is... your birthday!

97
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,196
Happy Birthday son!

98
00:06:17,560 --> 00:06:19,790
Thought we'd forgot, didn't you!

99
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,280
But ten years old is a big deal!

100
00:06:22,315 --> 00:06:24,157
You're a big boy now, aren't you?

101
00:06:24,200 --> 00:06:25,952
(ON) So how did you like the present?

102
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,080
We haven't gotten it yet, you idiot!

103
00:06:27,115 --> 00:06:27,717
What?

104
00:06:27,800 --> 00:06:29,552
No, I fixed it with Granny.

105
00:06:31,080 --> 00:06:33,753
Yes, you can go into town tomorrow
and pick out whatever you like.

106
00:06:33,800 --> 00:06:34,755
Not too expensive!

107
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:36,669
Just joking, son!

108
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,474
But we'll see you real soon
and uh remember you have yourself a

109
00:06:40,520 --> 00:06:42,078
Happy birthday!

110
00:06:50,840 --> 00:06:52,398
It wasn't the president.

111
00:06:54,480 --> 00:06:57,278
Happy birthday to you!

112
00:06:57,600 --> 00:07:01,309
Happy birthday to you!

113
00:07:01,360 --> 00:07:05,990
Happy birthday dear Arthur!

114
00:07:06,040 --> 00:07:10,795
Happy birthday to you!

115
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,875
You know what?
You're the best Granny in the world!

116
00:07:16,040 --> 00:07:17,951
And you're the best grandson!

117
00:07:19,000 --> 00:07:20,149
Go on, blow them out!

118
00:07:21,240 --> 00:07:22,468
Presents first?

119
00:07:23,000 --> 00:07:25,753
Oh, right. This is from Alfred.

120
00:07:31,520 --> 00:07:34,398
I never had a new one before!
Thank you Alfred!

121
00:07:34,960 --> 00:07:37,400
No, ah! If you could wait till
you're outside to throw it

122
00:07:37,435 --> 00:07:38,628
I'd consider that a favor

123
00:07:38,760 --> 00:07:40,318
Oh, yeah, you're right.

124
00:07:40,640 --> 00:07:42,312
And this is from me.

125
00:07:45,800 --> 00:07:47,791
It's beautiful!

126
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,478
How did you manage to bake a cake?
I thought the oven was broken.

127
00:07:58,520 --> 00:08:00,909
Mrs. Kerman from the hardware store
actually made it!

128
00:08:01,400 --> 00:08:02,594
Still like it?

129
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:06,475
It's fantastic. Just too big for three.

130
00:08:07,000 --> 00:08:10,754
Don't be too hard on them
Arthur! They try their best

131
00:08:11,160 --> 00:08:13,799
I spend my whole year
in boarding school in England,

132
00:08:14,720 --> 00:08:18,474
and when I come back for vacation
they're not even here!

133
00:08:20,040 --> 00:08:24,352
Anyway I'm used to it now
they're never here for my birthday.

134
00:08:26,760 --> 00:08:28,955
Wait! Make a wish.

135
00:08:29,240 --> 00:08:35,509
I wish that, for my next birthday
Grandpa will be here to share it.

136
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:40,233
Better blow them out quick
you don't wanna eat a wax cake!

137
00:08:44,200 --> 00:08:47,636
Every night this
magnificent sunset was all ours.

138
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,389
It's precisely into this landscape
that your mother came into the world.

139
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:55,036
While I was having the baby
your grandfather was painting this.

140
00:08:56,000 --> 00:08:56,910
Who are they?

141
00:08:57,040 --> 00:08:58,553
The BOGO-MATASSALAI.

142
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,394
Your grandfather helped build
an irrigation ditch for them

143
00:09:01,440 --> 00:09:05,274
and in return they gave him
a big bag of rubies.

144
00:09:05,320 --> 00:09:05,991
Really?

145
00:09:06,040 --> 00:09:09,237
Really. Oh, I could tell you stories all night long

146
00:09:09,280 --> 00:09:10,156
Great! Tell me.

147
00:09:10,280 --> 00:09:12,316
No, not tonight, Arthur, maybe tomorrow.

148
00:09:12,400 --> 00:09:12,957
Come on!

149
00:09:13,000 --> 00:09:13,989
No, I haven't even cleaned the kitchen.

150
00:09:14,160 --> 00:09:17,709
Please, Granny. Just a little! It's my birthday!

151
00:09:18,240 --> 00:09:21,676
Alright, just one minute.

152
00:09:21,760 --> 00:09:22,829
OK.

153
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:26,712
The Bogo-Matassalai were very, very tall.

154
00:09:27,000 --> 00:09:30,515
They say that nature always balances itself
with its opposite

155
00:09:30,640 --> 00:09:32,039
and for centuries they searched for them,

156
00:09:32,080 --> 00:09:34,514
in order to find perfect harmony.

157
00:09:34,560 --> 00:09:35,549
And did they find them?

158
00:09:35,600 --> 00:09:39,229
Yes.
It was another tribe living right next to them

159
00:09:39,280 --> 00:09:44,229
and they had this particular trait:
they were small as a tooth...

160
00:09:46,600 --> 00:09:49,797
They called them the Minimoys!

161
00:09:51,000 --> 00:09:53,468
Wow! Did they get along?

162
00:09:53,520 --> 00:09:56,751
Oh, wonderfully! Soon they were inseparable!

163
00:09:57,400 --> 00:09:59,240
The one side very incredibly tall,

164
00:09:59,275 --> 00:10:01,549
the other incredibly small.
And only together could

165
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,680
they have a complete vision of the world.

166
00:10:04,715 --> 00:10:05,795
Who's this?

167
00:10:06,200 --> 00:10:10,318
This is the Princess Selenia.
Daughter of the king of the Minimoys.

168
00:10:11,120 --> 00:10:15,480
She's beautiful! I mean, this is incredible!

169
00:10:15,515 --> 00:10:17,198
Yes and the king himself
gave your grandfather

170
00:10:17,280 --> 00:10:18,076
the secret of
how to find him anytime he wanted!

171
00:10:18,120 --> 00:10:20,920
That's what your grandfather said;

172
00:10:20,955 --> 00:10:25,277
every time he was a little drunk.

173
00:10:25,560 --> 00:10:27,471
I'd like to meet the Minimoys too.

174
00:10:29,400 --> 00:10:31,152
Now, to sleep!

175
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,430
Sweet dreams.

176
00:10:53,800 --> 00:10:57,759
We miss you Archibald. We really do.

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,069
No!

178
00:11:33,200 --> 00:11:35,236
How you doing, kid?

179
00:11:47,600 --> 00:11:49,431
Nice shot.

180
00:12:09,640 --> 00:12:12,154
Oh! Mr. Davido! You startled me!

181
00:12:12,200 --> 00:12:13,599
I'm so sorry!'

182
00:12:13,640 --> 00:12:15,596
Spring cleaning? Need a hand?

183
00:12:15,640 --> 00:12:17,517
No, thank you. What do you want this time?

184
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:20,358
Here it is! Done! Signed
sealed and delivered.

185
00:12:20,400 --> 00:12:21,469
You didn't waste any time!

186
00:12:21,520 --> 00:12:23,397
That was a coincidence really.
I was in church, this morning

187
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:25,431
You were in church?
I've never seen you there.

188
00:12:25,480 --> 00:12:28,120
Oh, I usually sit in the back. Modesty really.

189
00:12:28,155 --> 00:12:29,030
You really should have been there.

190
00:12:29,080 --> 00:12:29,956
You would have seen the Mayor,

191
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:31,035
who confirmed the document

192
00:12:31,080 --> 00:12:32,399
which pronounces the expiration
of your ownership

193
00:12:32,440 --> 00:12:35,159
of this property for lack of payment.
The president of the bank,

194
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:39,149
who transferred your debt to me.
And as amazing as it may seem,

195
00:12:39,200 --> 00:12:40,519
you know who else was there?

196
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,994
The Notary and the Chief of Police

197
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:44,758
who countersigned the order of eviction.

198
00:12:44,800 --> 00:12:47,394
So you see
there is not a single signature missing,

199
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:50,477
and if your husband does not sign this paper
within the next 48 hours,

200
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,075
I will be under the obligation to evict you
from this property

201
00:12:53,120 --> 00:12:56,112
whether your laundry is dry or not!

202
00:12:56,560 --> 00:13:00,030
Ah! You should to hang him up to dry as well!

203
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,836
Are we gonna have to leave the house?

204
00:13:02,880 --> 00:13:04,233
I'm afraid so

205
00:13:04,880 --> 00:13:07,440
I won't be able to hold off
that vulture Davido much longer

206
00:13:07,480 --> 00:13:08,754
but what about the treasure?

207
00:13:09,080 --> 00:13:10,957
The rubies that the Matassalais gave Grandpa?

208
00:13:11,480 --> 00:13:13,835
Your grandpa hid them somewhere out
there in the yard.

209
00:13:13,880 --> 00:13:15,154
I dug for weeks!

210
00:13:15,200 --> 00:13:18,158
And I... he hid them so well I haven't been
able to find them.

211
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,756
Where are you going?

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:23,757
You think I'm gonna hang around

213
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:24,915
twiddling my thumbs for forty eight hours?

214
00:13:24,960 --> 00:13:26,109
I'm gonna find the treasure!

215
00:13:28,880 --> 00:13:31,348
Just like his Grandpa!

216
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:47,156
You should go and find my car rather
than sitting there watching me.

217
00:13:55,120 --> 00:13:56,519
Can I help you?

218
00:13:58,000 --> 00:13:59,115
Oh! Pardon me!

219
00:13:59,680 --> 00:14:02,558
You came by our house once and left this.

220
00:14:02,800 --> 00:14:06,190
You said if we ever wanted to get rid
of any furniture or knick knacks

221
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:06,956
Yes?

222
00:14:07,000 --> 00:14:11,516
Well, I, I brought this...
it's from my private collection

223
00:14:11,560 --> 00:14:14,028
I wondered if it was at all valuable.

224
00:14:16,200 --> 00:14:19,476
Ah! What is this? A carnival mask?

225
00:14:19,600 --> 00:14:22,280
No, this is an African mask.

226
00:14:22,315 --> 00:14:24,874
This is... this belonged to the chief
of the Bogo-Matassalai tribe.

227
00:14:25,000 --> 00:14:25,512
Two bucks.

228
00:14:25,560 --> 00:14:30,076
Two dollars?
But this is... of inestimable value

229
00:14:30,120 --> 00:14:30,950
Alright alright, two fifty.

230
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:32,000
That's the best I can do!

231
00:14:32,035 --> 00:14:34,639
This kind of exotic object
just isn't selling any more.

232
00:14:34,840 --> 00:14:39,231
People want practical
concrete, modern stuff, you know.

233
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:44,154
I can't believe you'd have hidden the treasure
in the yard

234
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:46,760
without leaving some sort of clue,

235
00:14:46,800 --> 00:14:48,279
a note, something to help us find it!

236
00:14:53,280 --> 00:14:55,919
Malthazar... the Evil... M

237
00:15:01,800 --> 00:15:03,358
I hope
I have the honor of meeting you one day,

238
00:15:03,400 --> 00:15:04,310
Princess! In the meantime

239
00:15:05,400 --> 00:15:09,757
Permit me to steal a kiss.

240
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:14,154
Jealous!

241
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,640
I knew it!

242
00:15:20,675 --> 00:15:25,270
to get to the land of the Minimoys
put your trust in Shakespeare.

243
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:36,836
The house is here... south is that way.

244
00:15:38,280 --> 00:15:40,840
The tree! The elf! The moon!

245
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:41,278
It's all there!

246
00:15:41,320 --> 00:15:43,038
Alfred! We found it! Yes!

247
00:15:43,080 --> 00:15:44,354
Ah!

248
00:15:44,400 --> 00:15:45,594
Hang on there, young man!

249
00:15:45,640 --> 00:15:47,437
Arthur, how many times do
I have to tell you?

250
00:15:47,480 --> 00:15:48,629
I don't want you playing in this room.

251
00:15:49,280 --> 00:15:50,759
Excuse me, please, go ahead!

252
00:15:50,800 --> 00:15:51,437
Thank you

253
00:15:51,480 --> 00:15:51,957
Granny?!

254
00:15:52,000 --> 00:15:52,477
What?

255
00:15:52,520 --> 00:15:53,475
Who are these guys?

256
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,360
This gentleman is going to evaluate some of
your grandpa's things.

257
00:15:56,395 --> 00:15:57,031
Granny?!

258
00:15:57,080 --> 00:15:57,353
What?

259
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:58,714
You're not gonna sell grandpa's things?!

260
00:15:58,760 --> 00:16:00,751
I'm afraid I don't have any choice anymore!

261
00:16:00,800 --> 00:16:03,473
Yes we do! Look!
It's the map to get to the Minimoys!

262
00:16:03,520 --> 00:16:04,032
What map?

263
00:16:04,080 --> 00:16:04,557
They're here!

264
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:06,756
Grandpa brought them back
from Africa with him!

265
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:07,630
If we can get to them,

266
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,074
I'm sure they can lead us to the treasure!

267
00:16:09,120 --> 00:16:11,120
Arthur you're a big boy now, right?

268
00:16:11,155 --> 00:16:12,155
You don't really believe

269
00:16:12,200 --> 00:16:13,633
there are little elves running around the garden

270
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:15,079
just waiting for you to visit

271
00:16:15,120 --> 00:16:16,758
so they can slap a bag of rubies in your hand!

272
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:17,437
Pardon me?

273
00:16:18,080 --> 00:16:21,356
No, nothing...
I... I was chatting with my grandson.

274
00:16:21,400 --> 00:16:23,356
If you have jewels, we are interested

275
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,550
Unfortunately, not a jewel on the horizon.

276
00:16:25,720 --> 00:16:26,630
Go to your room, now

277
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,116
<some words may hide others>
William. 'S' for Socrates?

278
00:16:32,600 --> 00:16:35,000
Shakespeare. William Shakespeare.

279
00:16:35,035 --> 00:16:36,558
Ah! Not too far off!

280
00:16:36,600 --> 00:16:40,479
Yes. Better hurry and make your choice
before I change my mind.

281
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,271
Come on let's go.

282
00:16:42,520 --> 00:16:42,918
Granny

283
00:16:43,000 --> 00:16:43,477
Let's go

284
00:16:43,520 --> 00:16:44,270
Three hundred dollars.

285
00:16:44,960 --> 00:16:47,633
It's not very much for thirty years of memories!

286
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:49,875
A down payment! If sell them well
you'll have more

287
00:16:50,000 --> 00:16:51,274
thank you.

288
00:16:52,040 --> 00:16:52,756
Mrs. Suchot?

289
00:16:53,280 --> 00:16:54,156
Yes.

290
00:16:54,200 --> 00:16:55,269
Frederic De Saint-Clair.

291
00:16:55,320 --> 00:16:56,958
Process server, Bailiff.

292
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:59,355
It seems I came at an opportune time.

293
00:16:59,720 --> 00:17:01,870
I have a claim for
debt collection which concerns you,

294
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:04,195
for non-payment of services rendered
by a certain Mr. Davido,

295
00:17:04,320 --> 00:17:05,992
Ernest, for the amount of
two hundred fifty two dollars,

296
00:17:06,520 --> 00:17:08,351
now with the
six percent late penalty surcharge,

297
00:17:08,400 --> 00:17:09,276
and procedural fees added,

298
00:17:09,320 --> 00:17:12,153
that comes to a total of
two hundred ninety five dollars
and five cents.

299
00:17:12,200 --> 00:17:15,431
May I?

300
00:17:21,160 --> 00:17:22,798
Here's your change.

301
00:17:23,440 --> 00:17:23,838
Hello?

302
00:17:23,880 --> 00:17:25,916
Sweetie it's mom, is everything alright?

303
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:26,432
Great!

304
00:17:26,480 --> 00:17:28,391
We're cleaning up today!

305
00:17:28,440 --> 00:17:30,590
It's amazing how much old stuff
just piles up around the place...

306
00:17:30,640 --> 00:17:32,437
but, thanks to Granny, we threw it all out!

307
00:17:32,480 --> 00:17:34,755
Arthur! Don't upset your parents!

308
00:17:35,040 --> 00:17:36,439
Did you hang up on your mother?

309
00:17:36,480 --> 00:17:38,198
Of course not! It hung up by itself!

310
00:17:38,280 --> 00:17:39,760
Well, she'll call back in a second!

311
00:17:39,795 --> 00:17:41,796
Granny! They've cut the phone line!

312
00:17:41,840 --> 00:17:43,398
Don't you see what's happening?

313
00:17:43,440 --> 00:17:45,351
We've fallen into their trap,

314
00:17:45,400 --> 00:17:47,436
and it's closing in on us a little bit
more every minute!

315
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,592
But as long as I live and breathe,

316
00:17:49,640 --> 00:17:51,278
they're not gonna get this house!

317
00:17:52,080 --> 00:17:54,435
There you see? That's probably the repairman.

318
00:17:55,960 --> 00:17:56,756
Good evening ma'am!

319
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,755
You came at just the right time!

320
00:17:57,800 --> 00:17:59,711
Our phone's just been cut off

321
00:17:59,760 --> 00:18:01,432
and I really think you should warn people!

322
00:18:01,480 --> 00:18:01,992
I agree, ma'am,

323
00:18:02,120 --> 00:18:03,473
but I'm not from the phone company,

324
00:18:03,520 --> 00:18:05,272
I'm from the electric company.

325
00:18:05,320 --> 00:18:06,753
And I came to tell you

326
00:18:06,880 --> 00:18:08,438
that you're gonna be cut off soon
for nonpayment.

327
00:18:13,560 --> 00:18:15,596
Some words may hide others

328
00:18:15,640 --> 00:18:18,473
Grandpa help me

329
00:18:18,520 --> 00:18:19,999
When am I gonna get cut off?

330
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,278
That's what I call a clear answer...

331
00:18:23,640 --> 00:18:25,551
Don't move, I'll get a candle.

332
00:18:32,000 --> 00:18:37,711
Some words may hide others...! Of course!

333
00:18:37,760 --> 00:18:42,595
My dear Arthur. I was sure
I could count on you to find my riddle.

334
00:18:42,720 --> 00:18:45,720
You must be at least ten to have
become so clever.

335
00:18:45,755 --> 00:18:47,756
I, on the other hand, have not been so clever,

336
00:18:47,800 --> 00:18:51,759
and if you are reading this
I am probably dead.

337
00:18:51,800 --> 00:18:55,679
Therefore, the heavy task of accomplishing
my mission now falls to you.

338
00:18:55,720 --> 00:18:56,994
If you accept it, that is.

339
00:18:57,080 --> 00:18:58,640
I accept, Grandpa.

340
00:18:58,675 --> 00:19:01,154
I knew you would. Bravo.
To get to the land of the Minimoys,

341
00:19:01,200 --> 00:19:06,354
you must know on which day
the next passage will fall.

342
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:08,391
There's only one per year.

343
00:19:08,440 --> 00:19:12,991
Take the universal calendar from my desk.
The night of the tenth moon,

344
00:19:13,040 --> 00:19:14,439
at precisely midnight
the moonlight-passage will open

345
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:17,400
If you follow my instructions,

346
00:19:17,435 --> 00:19:19,630
on the twentieth knock, you

347
00:19:19,680 --> 00:19:22,638
will have the world in your hands

348
00:19:22,680 --> 00:19:28,437
That's today!

349
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:32,238
Night brings good counsel
Arthur. We'll sleep on it

350
00:19:32,280 --> 00:19:34,748
Tomorrow will bring a solution.

351
00:19:34,800 --> 00:19:36,080
Good night, Granny.

352
00:19:36,115 --> 00:19:37,195
Goodnight.

353
00:19:41,000 --> 00:19:45,073
The world in my hands... world in my hands.

354
00:19:45,640 --> 00:19:48,200
On the right side of the chimney,

355
00:19:48,240 --> 00:19:49,798
there's a button
Turn it all the way to the right,

356
00:19:49,840 --> 00:19:51,956
and then turn it back to the left.

357
00:19:52,360 --> 00:19:57,559
Only twenty minutes before midnight.
I've got to do something.

358
00:20:08,480 --> 00:20:09,469
Damn!

359
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:46,193
Ah! I thought you were in the shower!

360
00:20:46,240 --> 00:20:48,400
No, I was in the living room looking
for my sleeping drops...

361
00:20:48,435 --> 00:20:50,560
And if you don't get back into bed this second

362
00:20:50,595 --> 00:20:53,160
I'm gonna make you drink the whole bottle!

363
00:20:53,195 --> 00:20:54,354
Go!

364
00:20:56,280 --> 00:20:58,271
Go on! Go on!

365
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:09,236
You know, I don't like to do this.

366
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,998
But I'm gonna lock you in.

367
00:21:11,080 --> 00:21:12,308
I don't want you to do anything stupid tonight.

368
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:12,758
OK.

369
00:21:13,000 --> 00:21:14,831
OK

370
00:22:06,120 --> 00:22:12,798
Alfred, what're you doing?
Go to sleep.
Is it the full moon or what?

371
00:22:13,840 --> 00:22:16,513
Thank you, Alfred

372
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,839
Aaaah!

373
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,036
Granny!?

374
00:22:53,320 --> 00:22:55,436
Always keeps this key with you

375
00:23:00,160 --> 00:23:03,072
The garden, the tree, the telescope

376
00:23:03,120 --> 00:23:04,872
Oh my god!

377
00:23:10,720 --> 00:23:12,153
I need more light!

378
00:23:17,280 --> 00:23:18,998
I've seen Granny do this a hundred times.

379
00:23:19,120 --> 00:23:42,034
Oh, yeah, the brake... Ah! Oh! No! No!

380
00:23:46,880 --> 00:23:48,791
Perfect!

381
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:54,233
Sorry, old man!

382
00:24:19,800 --> 00:24:21,791
Now for the dolls.

383
00:24:42,600 --> 00:24:44,795
Ah! Alfred!

384
00:24:54,760 --> 00:24:55,988
Arthur?

385
00:24:56,400 --> 00:24:58,595
Uh, yeah.

386
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,517
Follow me!

387
00:25:00,600 --> 00:25:01,999
Oh, okay

388
00:25:09,400 --> 00:25:11,038
Hi.

389
00:25:40,280 --> 00:25:41,952
Time to go.

390
00:25:42,000 --> 00:25:43,718
You're not coming?

391
00:25:44,320 --> 00:25:46,197
Only one can pass through,

392
00:25:46,280 --> 00:25:49,477
and you seem to us to be the best
choice to combat Evil M

393
00:25:49,520 --> 00:25:50,350
MALTHAZAR?

394
00:25:50,440 --> 00:25:51,839
Oh!

395
00:25:52,000 --> 00:25:53,956
Never, never speak that name.

396
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:54,876
It brings bad luck.

397
00:25:55,000 --> 00:25:56,115
OK, OK...

398
00:25:56,440 --> 00:25:58,635
Your grandfather went off to defeat him,

399
00:25:58,680 --> 00:26:01,069
and now it's up to you to continue his fight

400
00:26:01,720 --> 00:26:02,755
Thanks for the honor,

401
00:26:03,000 --> 00:26:05,355
but... I think it might be better
if I leave my place to one of you

402
00:26:05,920 --> 00:26:07,956
I mean, you're so much bigger
and stronger than me...!

403
00:26:08,040 --> 00:26:09,837
Your heart is the strongest of weapons.

404
00:26:10,400 --> 00:26:11,435
OK.

405
00:26:13,600 --> 00:26:20,358
The first ring, for the body
three times to the right

406
00:26:21,360 --> 00:26:27,674
The second ring, for the mind
three times to... the left.

407
00:26:28,040 --> 00:26:38,996
And the third ring... one whole turn for the soul

408
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:41,399
Ah!

409
00:26:43,960 --> 00:26:45,439
There! The door is open!

410
00:26:45,480 --> 00:26:47,040
You can introduce yourself!

411
00:26:47,075 --> 00:26:48,075
Introduce myself?

412
00:26:48,120 --> 00:26:50,634
Yes, and try to be convincing
because you only have five minutes.

413
00:26:50,720 --> 00:26:54,872
Alright! Be convincing! OK! OK!

414
00:27:04,200 --> 00:27:08,318
Euh... There's a... with

415
00:27:12,440 --> 00:27:13,509
Archibald?

416
00:27:14,000 --> 00:27:14,591
No, no... No.

417
00:27:14,680 --> 00:27:16,716
Introduce yourself!

418
00:27:17,800 --> 00:27:21,190
I... I'm his grandson... My name is Arthur...
and you are

419
00:27:21,240 --> 00:27:23,196
Saimono Matrodoy de Betameche

420
00:27:23,240 --> 00:27:24,116
Right...

421
00:27:24,160 --> 00:27:25,434
But you can call me Beta...

422
00:27:25,480 --> 00:27:27,550
Pleased to meet you, Beta

423
00:27:27,600 --> 00:27:29,280
I hope you have a good reason
for using the beam like that,

424
00:27:29,315 --> 00:27:31,360
because the Council has strictly forbidden it

425
00:27:31,395 --> 00:27:32,952
Go on! Go on!

426
00:27:33,000 --> 00:27:35,639
This is a matter of extreme urgency!

427
00:27:35,920 --> 00:27:37,911
In just two days' time
the garden will be destroyed

428
00:27:37,960 --> 00:27:39,359
What are you talking about, young man?

429
00:27:39,400 --> 00:27:40,719
Are you a practical joker
like your grandfather?

430
00:27:40,800 --> 00:27:42,560
This is no joke, Mister Betameche...

431
00:27:42,595 --> 00:27:45,074
A building contractor wants to flatten the land

432
00:27:45,120 --> 00:27:45,996
and build apartment blocks!

433
00:27:46,160 --> 00:27:47,912
Ah...! What are apartment blocks?

434
00:27:47,960 --> 00:27:50,269
Enormous houses built from concrete that

435
00:27:50,520 --> 00:27:54,115
will cover up all the gardens
and stop the flowers from growing!

436
00:27:54,160 --> 00:27:55,115
Ah! But what's awful!

437
00:27:55,320 --> 00:27:57,675
The only way to prevent this is for me
to find the treasure

438
00:27:57,720 --> 00:27:59,358
that my grandfather has hidden somewhere!

439
00:27:59,760 --> 00:28:00,158
Then

440
00:28:00,200 --> 00:28:03,158
I'll be able to pay off the contractor
and none of this will happen!

441
00:28:03,200 --> 00:28:06,240
Well, that's a really good idea!
All's well that ends well!

442
00:28:06,275 --> 00:28:07,434
See ya!

443
00:28:07,720 --> 00:28:09,915
No, no! To do that...
I need to pass into your world

444
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:11,752
so I can start looking for the treasure!

445
00:28:12,040 --> 00:28:14,315
That's not possible!
You can't make a journey just like that

446
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:15,594
The council must first be assembled...

447
00:28:15,680 --> 00:28:17,080
then you must explain your problem to them,

448
00:28:17,115 --> 00:28:18,149
they will then deliberate and

449
00:28:18,200 --> 00:28:21,272
And in two days' time the land will be
flattened and you'll all be dead!

450
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,353
This is an extreme emergency.

451
00:28:23,400 --> 00:28:24,992
Yes, and we have to act now

452
00:28:25,240 --> 00:28:27,356
because the future of your people
is in your hands!

453
00:28:27,520 --> 00:28:30,512
Yes, you're right in my hands.
This calls for action!

454
00:28:31,520 --> 00:28:33,795
Ferryman! Ferryman! Wake-up
it's an emergency!

455
00:28:33,920 --> 00:28:35,114
You did well!

456
00:28:35,160 --> 00:28:36,991
I hope it will be enough to convince him!

457
00:28:40,200 --> 00:28:41,952
Betameche? You little good-for-nothing!

458
00:28:42,000 --> 00:28:43,399
Don't you have anything better to do

459
00:28:43,480 --> 00:28:45,232
than go around waking up honest people?

460
00:28:45,280 --> 00:28:47,200
My father sent me. It's for a trip!

461
00:28:47,235 --> 00:28:48,349
What again!?

462
00:28:48,440 --> 00:28:49,839
Why does everyone want to suddenly travel?!

463
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:51,074
The last one was three years ago...

464
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:53,839
Exactly, that's what I mean
I was just starting to nod off

465
00:28:53,880 --> 00:28:55,029
Hurry up, the King is losing patience!

466
00:28:55,080 --> 00:28:55,637
The King! The King!

467
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,394
First, the moon...! Is it full now?

468
00:28:58,600 --> 00:28:59,476
Perfect, perfect!

469
00:28:59,520 --> 00:29:01,078
Now for the rings

470
00:29:01,520 --> 00:29:05,354
So... three turns to the right for the body

471
00:29:06,880 --> 00:29:10,111
three turns to the left for the spirit.

472
00:29:10,520 --> 00:29:13,637
and now, one whole turn for the soul.

473
00:29:19,800 --> 00:29:21,438
What's happening to me?!

474
00:29:21,480 --> 00:29:24,358
You are going to join our brothers
the Minimoys!

475
00:29:24,400 --> 00:29:25,719
They will lead you to

476
00:29:25,800 --> 00:29:26,676
Help! the Seven Kingdoms.

477
00:29:27,000 --> 00:29:27,671
Stop!

478
00:29:28,000 --> 00:29:29,399
You only have thirty-six hours!

479
00:29:29,640 --> 00:29:30,152
Granny!

480
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:31,240
At noon on the day after tomorrow,

481
00:29:31,275 --> 00:29:34,437
the gateway will close again for 1000 days!

482
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,598
Thirty six hours... I'll do my best!

483
00:29:37,640 --> 00:29:38,868
Aaaaaaaah!

484
00:29:38,920 --> 00:29:40,831
Good luck, Arthur.

485
00:29:40,880 --> 00:29:43,599
Aaaaaaaah!

486
00:29:52,680 --> 00:29:54,159
The key! You have the key!

487
00:29:54,680 --> 00:29:55,510
The key?

488
00:29:56,400 --> 00:29:57,310
Yeah I have the key!

489
00:30:00,080 --> 00:30:01,920
OK. Now go over to the lock.

490
00:30:01,955 --> 00:30:05,356
The lock...? That has to be it.

491
00:30:05,400 --> 00:30:08,198
Good! Good! Now turn the key.

492
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,632
I'm gonna die!

493
00:30:13,800 --> 00:30:15,597
Yes!

494
00:30:15,640 --> 00:30:26,551
No, no, no, no, no! Aaaaah!

495
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,997
Welcome to the Land of the Minimoys!

496
00:30:31,200 --> 00:30:33,270
It's not funny! You really scared me!

497
00:30:33,320 --> 00:30:34,469
I thought I was going to die in that

498
00:30:37,880 --> 00:30:38,630
That's incredible!

499
00:30:38,840 --> 00:30:39,989
What's incredible?

500
00:30:40,160 --> 00:30:42,515
I dunno, just look at my clothes
they've changed!

501
00:30:42,560 --> 00:30:43,834
You can admire yourself later.

502
00:30:43,920 --> 00:30:46,388
The council's waiting for you...
Come on, follow me!

503
00:30:48,800 --> 00:30:51,439
I think I'd like to take a little nap

504
00:31:04,640 --> 00:31:05,595
How far've they got?!

505
00:31:05,800 --> 00:31:08,314
You're joking, they've only just started.

506
00:31:25,640 --> 00:31:27,870
Princess Selenia!

507
00:31:35,000 --> 00:31:36,228
My little girl

508
00:31:36,280 --> 00:31:37,599
Father!

509
00:31:37,680 --> 00:31:43,198
Sorry. Princess Selenia
may the spirits of the Ancients guide you.

510
00:31:46,520 --> 00:31:47,111
Papa!

511
00:31:47,520 --> 00:31:49,112
Yes?

512
00:31:49,160 --> 00:31:49,797
Papa!

513
00:31:49,840 --> 00:31:50,511
Where are you?

514
00:31:50,600 --> 00:31:51,669
I'm over here!

515
00:31:51,920 --> 00:31:52,750
My son!

516
00:31:52,800 --> 00:31:54,313
You did that on purpose, didn't you?

517
00:31:54,440 --> 00:31:56,317
Couldn't you have waited ten seconds
before playing the clown?

518
00:31:56,360 --> 00:31:58,032
I'm on a mission of great importance!

519
00:31:58,080 --> 00:32:00,469
Aah? Because my mission isn't of great
importance is that it?

520
00:32:00,520 --> 00:32:01,999
You're far too arrogant to
be able to free the sword!

521
00:32:02,040 --> 00:32:02,480
You know you are!

522
00:32:02,515 --> 00:32:02,880
Uh!

523
00:32:02,915 --> 00:32:04,916
Enough! Stop bickering, the two of you!

524
00:32:05,200 --> 00:32:06,155
Betameche!

525
00:32:06,200 --> 00:32:07,553
I hope

526
00:32:07,600 --> 00:32:08,828
you have good reason for daring to
disrupt this important ceremony.

527
00:32:08,880 --> 00:32:12,316
I do father!
The Upperlands Light Beam
was activated today.

528
00:32:13,200 --> 00:32:14,713
Who would dare do this?

529
00:32:14,800 --> 00:32:15,630
His name is Arthur.

530
00:32:15,800 --> 00:32:16,994
He is the grandson of Archibald,

531
00:32:17,080 --> 00:32:19,435
and he says a great misfortune is
about to befall us

532
00:32:19,480 --> 00:32:21,480
Our great misfortune has a name:

533
00:32:21,515 --> 00:32:22,469
The Evil M.

534
00:32:22,520 --> 00:32:23,953
And we have no need of this Arthur person.

535
00:32:24,000 --> 00:32:26,275
As the Princess of royal blood,

536
00:32:26,320 --> 00:32:29,153
the task of protecting our People falls to me.
Hmm!

537
00:32:42,720 --> 00:32:47,236
It's moving! I have it, I have it! I feel it!

538
00:32:53,280 --> 00:32:53,996
Hah!

539
00:32:54,040 --> 00:32:56,713
See, told you so. Way too arrogant.

540
00:32:57,400 --> 00:32:58,719
In view of the circumstances,

541
00:32:58,760 --> 00:33:00,716
the Council agrees to hear this young man.

542
00:33:14,360 --> 00:33:15,270
Cute huh?

543
00:33:15,320 --> 00:33:16,912
Ordinary

544
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:20,398
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

545
00:33:20,440 --> 00:33:21,919
Who told him my name?

546
00:33:21,960 --> 00:33:23,518
My humble respects, Princess Selenia.

547
00:33:23,560 --> 00:33:25,400
I'm sure it was you
you're only one that knows this Arthur

548
00:33:25,435 --> 00:33:26,753
You can't keep a secret

549
00:33:26,800 --> 00:33:28,597
My humble respects, your Majesty.

550
00:33:28,640 --> 00:33:31,871
Um... yes... my respects

551
00:33:31,920 --> 00:33:34,639
Oh Arthur, I am delighted to meet you...

552
00:33:34,680 --> 00:33:36,716
I was a good friend
of your grandfather Archibald!

553
00:33:37,040 --> 00:33:38,393
Well, young man... we've all ears!

554
00:33:39,800 --> 00:33:40,516
It's like this...

555
00:33:40,560 --> 00:33:41,595
In just under two days some men
are going to come

556
00:33:41,640 --> 00:33:43,631
and destroy my house, my garden,

557
00:33:43,880 --> 00:33:45,074
my world. And your world.

558
00:33:45,240 --> 00:33:47,276
And you, all two and a half millimeters of you,

559
00:33:47,400 --> 00:33:48,480
you've come to save us, is that it?

560
00:33:48,515 --> 00:33:50,232
The only way to stop these men
is to pay them off!

561
00:33:50,400 --> 00:33:52,356
This is why my grandfather
came to you three years ago.

562
00:33:52,840 --> 00:33:56,037
He was looking for a treasure and...
I've come to complete his mission.

563
00:33:56,080 --> 00:33:58,071
Your grandfather was a remarkable man

564
00:33:58,120 --> 00:34:00,200
He taught us so many things!

565
00:34:00,235 --> 00:34:02,998
He was the one who showed Miro
how to harness image and light.

566
00:34:03,520 --> 00:34:05,078
Then one day he left,

567
00:34:05,120 --> 00:34:06,920
in search of this famous treasure.

568
00:34:06,955 --> 00:34:09,600
And after wandering through the seven lands
which make up our world,

569
00:34:09,635 --> 00:34:12,512
he finally found it

570
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,358
Deep in the Forbidden Lands
in the heart of the city of Necropolis,

571
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,757
where he reigns supreme...
the Evil M. And unfortunately,

572
00:34:19,800 --> 00:34:23,349
no one every returns from the Forbidden Lands

573
00:34:23,760 --> 00:34:24,829
So

574
00:34:27,400 --> 00:34:29,038
Look out! To the central gate!

575
00:34:35,680 --> 00:34:37,716
It's Gondolo, the Juggler of the Great River

576
00:34:37,760 --> 00:34:41,469
That's incredible we thought
he was lost forever in the Forbidden Lands

577
00:34:42,400 --> 00:34:43,276
Stop!

578
00:34:44,320 --> 00:34:45,594
What's wrong, Arthur?

579
00:34:45,640 --> 00:34:46,516
Sire, look over there,

580
00:34:46,720 --> 00:34:48,472
it looks as if a piece is peeling off.

581
00:34:48,520 --> 00:34:49,475
I think it's a trap.

582
00:34:49,720 --> 00:34:51,233
That's a painted canvas,

583
00:34:51,680 --> 00:34:53,238
my grandfather used to do this in Africa to
protect himself from wild animals

584
00:34:55,600 --> 00:34:55,634
Well, we're not wild animals

585
00:34:55,680 --> 00:34:57,557
and we're not going to leave
this unhappy creature to die...

586
00:34:57,600 --> 00:34:59,079
Here, make yourself useful!

587
00:35:01,160 --> 00:35:04,152
Oh! Oh my god! Gondolo

588
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:09,513
Selenia!

589
00:35:09,560 --> 00:35:10,675
Yes, take it easy, Gondolo.

590
00:35:10,720 --> 00:35:12,517
It's a... trap!

591
00:35:23,680 --> 00:35:24,590
Oh...! oh my god!

592
00:35:28,920 --> 00:35:29,796
Arthur!

593
00:35:29,920 --> 00:35:30,796
Clo... close the gate!

594
00:35:30,840 --> 00:35:31,909
Charge!

595
00:35:49,040 --> 00:35:49,836
Come on!

596
00:36:01,240 --> 00:36:02,593
Ready to fire!

597
00:36:07,680 --> 00:36:08,430
Watch out!

598
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:11,558
Follow me to the palace!

599
00:36:12,120 --> 00:36:13,155
Hurry, father!

600
00:36:13,200 --> 00:36:15,156
Yes, yes, I'm coming.

601
00:36:21,000 --> 00:36:23,389
Hah! Oh, I am sorry, I'm so clumsy

602
00:36:28,360 --> 00:36:30,874
Ahem, perfect timing...
I rather fancied stretching my legs a little

603
00:36:31,360 --> 00:36:32,509
Father! Go and take cover, quickly!

604
00:36:32,560 --> 00:36:33,200
Out of the question!

605
00:36:33,235 --> 00:36:34,920
It's king's duty to face his destiny...

606
00:36:34,955 --> 00:36:36,239
and if only one person is left standing,

607
00:36:37,320 --> 00:36:37,433
I will be that person

608
00:36:39,960 --> 00:36:40,756
Ah!

609
00:36:42,280 --> 00:36:44,360
Art... we have to go on fighting!

610
00:36:44,395 --> 00:36:45,475
Sure, but with what?!

611
00:36:45,560 --> 00:36:46,470
Take my weapon. I'll find another one!

612
00:36:52,680 --> 00:36:53,590
This is not working.

613
00:36:58,400 --> 00:37:00,994
Gentlemen, it's time to face up to reality.

614
00:37:02,840 --> 00:37:04,640
Watch out... the walls are booby trapped...

615
00:37:04,675 --> 00:37:06,790
fly close to the roof... it's much safer

616
00:37:07,120 --> 00:37:08,519
I couldn't agree with you more

617
00:37:09,240 --> 00:37:10,120
Come on, my lovebirds!

618
00:37:10,155 --> 00:37:11,951
This is your chance to prove you really
love each other

619
00:37:12,000 --> 00:37:12,880
Here you go

620
00:37:12,915 --> 00:37:14,518
Okay, we'll let them have one final kiss

621
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:19,115
Okay, that's enough now!

622
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:21,357
When I blow my whistle,

623
00:37:21,880 --> 00:37:23,438
release your Romeo so he
can get back to his Juliet

624
00:37:23,600 --> 00:37:24,191
OK!

625
00:37:27,840 --> 00:37:29,432
Oh no!

626
00:37:49,440 --> 00:37:51,715
Hi! Okay, here we go

627
00:37:57,640 --> 00:37:58,709
Ah! Come on!

628
00:38:07,080 --> 00:38:09,240
Right, this can't be more complicated
than driving a car!

629
00:38:09,275 --> 00:38:12,994
Aah!

630
00:38:15,600 --> 00:38:17,033
Beta! Look out!

631
00:38:18,440 --> 00:38:20,908
Arthur, I'll never forget you!

632
00:38:35,920 --> 00:38:40,152
No, you fool! it's not feeding time!

633
00:38:41,560 --> 00:38:45,439
No... not the gap...! not the gap! Oh! Oh!

634
00:38:55,920 --> 00:38:59,754
Oh! oh! oh!

635
00:39:01,520 --> 00:39:03,476
OK... here we go again...!

636
00:39:05,360 --> 00:39:06,793
That's it, I've got it!

637
00:39:07,680 --> 00:39:08,999
And one mosquito down!

638
00:39:16,240 --> 00:39:18,400
That's better... now let's go for it!

639
00:39:18,435 --> 00:39:19,435
How brave he is,

640
00:39:20,480 --> 00:39:20,680
how heroic!

641
00:39:20,715 --> 00:39:22,520
It's amazing how much he's just like me!

642
00:39:22,555 --> 00:39:23,760
He'd make a good partner!

643
00:39:23,795 --> 00:39:25,079
Father, I'm old enough to look after
myself now

644
00:39:25,560 --> 00:39:26,310
Forget it... Forget it

645
00:39:28,760 --> 00:39:30,478
Oh! So who's next in line?

646
00:39:37,160 --> 00:39:38,036
Oh no!

647
00:39:38,480 --> 00:39:39,200
Oh yes!

648
00:39:39,235 --> 00:39:40,428
Betameche!

649
00:39:40,760 --> 00:39:41,200
Arthur?!

650
00:39:41,235 --> 00:39:42,110
Do something!

651
00:39:42,240 --> 00:39:43,958
Hang on, Arthur, I'm coming!

652
00:39:55,040 --> 00:39:56,871
What a gift he is!

653
00:39:59,640 --> 00:40:01,596
Come to think of it, he does remind me of you.

654
00:40:03,200 --> 00:40:04,120
You OK? Nothing broken?

655
00:40:04,155 --> 00:40:05,872
I'm not sure.
I can't feel anything on my butt!

656
00:40:07,800 --> 00:40:10,000
Just one question...
where did you learn to fly like that!

657
00:40:10,035 --> 00:40:12,468
Umm., driving with my grandfather.

658
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:13,714
Oh, that makes sense.

659
00:40:14,280 --> 00:40:16,589
Let's rise to the occasion.

660
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:21,154
Aaah... All's well that ends well.

661
00:40:25,760 --> 00:40:28,558
Mogoth! Let's show them what we're made of!

662
00:40:32,520 --> 00:40:34,200
Selenia... The Master wishes to see you.

663
00:40:34,235 --> 00:40:35,800
Follow us and no harm will come to you!

664
00:40:35,835 --> 00:40:37,000
Come and get me!

665
00:40:37,035 --> 00:40:38,040
Right, go on, grab her!

666
00:40:38,075 --> 00:40:38,400
Why me?

667
00:40:38,435 --> 00:40:39,240
Well, who else?

668
00:40:39,275 --> 00:40:39,880
Well, you for example!

669
00:40:39,915 --> 00:40:40,790
Me? Why me?

670
00:40:41,000 --> 00:40:42,560
Four of you attacking one woman!

671
00:40:42,595 --> 00:40:43,800
Aren't you ashamed of yourselves?

672
00:40:43,835 --> 00:40:44,760
No!

673
00:40:44,795 --> 00:40:45,720
Pick on someone your own size!

674
00:40:45,755 --> 00:40:46,630
With pleasure... With pleasure!

675
00:40:47,160 --> 00:40:48,388
Long live the king!

676
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:49,995
Oh, my daughter!

677
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:01,080
My daughter, my child, I must do something!

678
00:41:01,115 --> 00:41:02,195
Cover me!

679
00:41:02,920 --> 00:41:03,830
...thank you.

680
00:41:10,280 --> 00:41:11,793
The sword of power.

681
00:41:16,320 --> 00:41:18,117
It's Miracle!

682
00:41:20,560 --> 00:41:22,040
OK, that's enough now.

683
00:41:22,075 --> 00:41:24,235
Get on your knees
and beg the Princess for forgiveness!

684
00:41:24,600 --> 00:41:25,396
Hmm!

685
00:41:35,000 --> 00:41:36,513
I said, on your knees!

686
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:37,959
And beg the princess!

687
00:41:41,200 --> 00:41:43,880
Forgive us, Princess Selenia

688
00:41:43,915 --> 00:41:45,359
I don't think we heard that.

689
00:41:45,400 --> 00:41:49,234
Our humblest apologies, Princess Selenia.

690
00:41:49,400 --> 00:41:51,436
Pff, I'll think about it.

691
00:41:52,480 --> 00:41:54,920
That's my daughter, just like her mother

692
00:41:54,955 --> 00:41:56,600
You fought like a prince!

693
00:41:56,635 --> 00:41:59,239
Thanks... This sword seems so light
it all seems so easy!

694
00:41:59,320 --> 00:41:59,920
Of course!

695
00:41:59,955 --> 00:42:00,880
It's magic sword.

696
00:42:00,915 --> 00:42:02,199
It's been embedded in that rock for years

697
00:42:02,240 --> 00:42:03,389
and you're the one who released it

698
00:42:03,440 --> 00:42:04,156
Really?!

699
00:42:04,200 --> 00:42:06,031
Oh yes, my friend... you're a hero now...

700
00:42:06,320 --> 00:42:13,440
Arthur the hero! Arthur the hero!
Arthur the hero!

701
00:42:13,475 --> 00:42:22,349
Long live Arthur the hero!

702
00:42:25,640 --> 00:42:27,280
Father! now that the sword has been freed
from the stone,

703
00:42:27,315 --> 00:42:28,508
we must act fast.

704
00:42:28,560 --> 00:42:30,437
I would like your permission
to continue my mission.

705
00:42:30,480 --> 00:42:31,390
Unfortunately,

706
00:42:31,440 --> 00:42:33,431
I have to agree with you, my child,

707
00:42:33,480 --> 00:42:34,920
but I must insist on one condition

708
00:42:34,955 --> 00:42:36,120
What condition is that?

709
00:42:36,155 --> 00:42:40,352
Arthur is brave and his heart is pure...
He will go with you.

710
00:42:40,400 --> 00:42:42,072
If that is what you wish, father

711
00:42:44,960 --> 00:42:48,157
I know you are going to make a fine team!

712
00:43:07,000 --> 00:43:08,120
The way is clear

713
00:43:08,155 --> 00:43:09,800
Are you sure that you
haven't forgotten anything?

714
00:43:09,835 --> 00:43:12,268
I'm sure, go ahead... let go

715
00:43:12,320 --> 00:43:14,788
Father
do we really have to take Betameche with us?

716
00:43:14,960 --> 00:43:16,757
Even if your brother is still young
one day he will be

717
00:43:17,360 --> 00:43:21,080
Arthur, if you should encounter
a small mole wearing glasses

718
00:43:21,115 --> 00:43:22,433
who answers to the name of Mino
on your travels...

719
00:43:22,480 --> 00:43:26,393
he is my son...
he's been missing for some three months now

720
00:43:26,520 --> 00:43:27,589
You can count on me.

721
00:43:27,800 --> 00:43:28,994
Alright, let's get going.

722
00:43:29,040 --> 00:43:30,075
Thank you, Arthur!

723
00:43:30,120 --> 00:43:31,758
Hey hero, let's go.

724
00:43:31,800 --> 00:43:32,949
Hey... wait for me

725
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:37,079
You could at least wait for me!

726
00:43:38,880 --> 00:43:42,190
Oh... I do hope they won't fall into any traps.

727
00:43:51,400 --> 00:43:54,631
I slept like a rock

728
00:44:01,880 --> 00:44:04,599
Arthur, time to get up

729
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,560
Selenia, slow down a bit, can't you?

730
00:44:24,600 --> 00:44:27,400
No way! It's your fault for loading yourself up
like a gamallus!

731
00:44:27,435 --> 00:44:29,680
I just packed a little bit of everything
y'know, just in case

732
00:44:29,715 --> 00:44:30,280
Uh... What's a gamallus?

733
00:44:30,315 --> 00:44:31,872
It's like a pachymollet, only much bigger.

734
00:44:32,040 --> 00:44:32,960
And what does a pachymollet look like?

735
00:44:32,995 --> 00:44:34,313
Like that!

736
00:44:36,560 --> 00:44:39,154
Any chance you got something in your bag
for dealing with pachymollets?

737
00:44:39,200 --> 00:44:41,680
Don't worry!
I've got my 300 function pocket knife here

738
00:44:41,715 --> 00:44:43,280
Double knife, multicrab clips,

739
00:44:43,315 --> 00:44:44,429
soap bubbles, music box

740
00:44:44,480 --> 00:44:46,232
and for when things get really hot... a fan!

741
00:44:46,280 --> 00:44:47,360
Hey, that's pretty handy alright!

742
00:44:47,395 --> 00:44:48,839
And then you've got all your classic functions:

743
00:44:48,880 --> 00:44:52,200
like your tulipan, matchet
sunjink, whistler, gullybar

744
00:44:52,235 --> 00:44:53,800
Nothing in there to cut off tongue
by any chance?

745
00:44:53,835 --> 00:44:56,075
No, but that's you specialty, isn't it?

746
00:44:56,680 --> 00:44:57,874
Stay right where you are!

747
00:45:00,000 --> 00:45:05,154
run on my signal... now!

748
00:45:11,080 --> 00:45:12,399
Here we are

749
00:45:19,160 --> 00:45:20,560
Anybody home?

750
00:45:20,595 --> 00:45:21,993
Not many people come through this way

751
00:45:22,040 --> 00:45:24,156
Once you've tried it, you'll understand why!

752
00:45:24,680 --> 00:45:26,238
Anybody home?

753
00:45:27,040 --> 00:45:28,871
Oh no! I... I'm sorry!

754
00:45:28,920 --> 00:45:30,080
I mistook you for a bell.

755
00:45:30,115 --> 00:45:34,039
Um, no, I mean
I didn't realize you were actually... alive!

756
00:45:34,080 --> 00:45:36,000
Hold on, ma que fa, stupido!

757
00:45:36,035 --> 00:45:36,512
What do you think

758
00:45:36,560 --> 00:45:38,118
you're doing knocking
out all o'my customers like that?

759
00:45:38,160 --> 00:45:40,080
It's not as if I got so many to start with.

760
00:45:40,115 --> 00:45:41,832
Hello. I am Princess Selenia.

761
00:45:41,880 --> 00:45:42,600
I know that...
and that is your stupido brother!

762
00:45:42,635 --> 00:45:44,320
So who's the third comedian

763
00:45:44,355 --> 00:45:47,118
who comes around knocking out
all the customers?

764
00:45:47,280 --> 00:45:50,033
My name's Arthur!
And I'm looking for my grandfather!

765
00:45:50,080 --> 00:45:52,719
Ah...?!
I transported a grandfather a few years ago

766
00:45:52,760 --> 00:45:57,993
An old eccentric madman
who absolutely insisted on being

767
00:45:58,040 --> 00:45:59,240
transported deep inside Seides territory... to

768
00:45:59,275 --> 00:46:00,680
That's him! That's my grandfather!

769
00:46:00,715 --> 00:46:02,272
And that's exactly where we wanna go!

770
00:46:02,400 --> 00:46:04,000
Sold out!

771
00:46:04,035 --> 00:46:04,477
Ah!

772
00:46:05,160 --> 00:46:07,879
Necropolis, sure, why not the moon as well

773
00:46:13,000 --> 00:46:14,160
We didn't ask you for the moon,

774
00:46:14,195 --> 00:46:17,709
we asked for three tickets to Necropolis
is that clear enough?

775
00:46:26,240 --> 00:46:28,071
Arthur!

776
00:46:30,520 --> 00:46:34,399
Arthur?! You break my door to steal the key?!

777
00:46:34,440 --> 00:46:36,954
Answer me Arthur! Ah!

778
00:46:37,480 --> 00:46:39,152
Arthur!

779
00:46:45,640 --> 00:46:57,199
Hey...! fasten your safety belts, please

780
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,990
Arrivederci!

781
00:47:00,640 --> 00:47:06,158
Arthur?! Arthur?!

782
00:47:08,560 --> 00:47:12,678
The car...? What's the car doing there?

783
00:47:18,040 --> 00:47:19,996
Ah, here it is!

784
00:47:22,600 --> 00:47:24,520
Wow... That's cool

785
00:47:24,555 --> 00:47:26,476
I got another one just like it in pink...
wanna see it?

786
00:47:26,520 --> 00:47:28,431
Beta, we've got enough light already

787
00:47:30,360 --> 00:47:31,315
Arthur

788
00:47:32,080 --> 00:47:33,280
Where exactly are we heading?

789
00:47:33,315 --> 00:47:34,960
We are here... and we're going here!

790
00:47:34,995 --> 00:47:37,720
Oh my gosh, I know where that is.
That's right under the water tank.

791
00:47:37,755 --> 00:47:38,960
A giant water tank

792
00:47:38,995 --> 00:47:40,712
in the hands of that unspeakable piece of.

793
00:47:40,760 --> 00:47:42,000
Now I'm starting to understand

794
00:47:42,035 --> 00:47:42,880
Who are you talking about?

795
00:47:42,915 --> 00:47:44,720
The most evil of evil

796
00:47:44,755 --> 00:47:46,200
Oh...! MALTHAZAR?!

797
00:47:46,235 --> 00:47:47,349
oops!

798
00:47:51,720 --> 00:47:53,312
Holy humpbacked gamallus!

799
00:47:53,360 --> 00:47:55,112
Didn't anyone ever teach you
to hold your tongue?!

800
00:47:55,160 --> 00:47:56,434
I... I'm really sorry!

801
00:47:56,480 --> 00:47:58,040
Arthur?!

802
00:47:58,075 --> 00:47:59,712
Granny?

803
00:48:02,040 --> 00:48:04,349
And... we're off!

804
00:48:08,200 --> 00:48:09,155
Arthur?

805
00:48:10,920 --> 00:48:12,640
How long is the flight?

806
00:48:12,675 --> 00:48:15,600
It's pretty short as long as we can avoid
any unpleasant encounters

807
00:48:15,635 --> 00:48:17,875
What do you mean by...
unpleasant encounters?

808
00:48:35,760 --> 00:48:36,680
Holy bumblebee!

809
00:48:36,715 --> 00:48:38,636
He smashed the door in and now we're stuck

810
00:48:40,440 --> 00:48:41,714
Whoa!

811
00:48:41,800 --> 00:48:42,480
What is that?

812
00:48:42,515 --> 00:48:45,074
I have no idea, but I don't think
we should hang around to find out!

813
00:48:45,120 --> 00:48:45,757
Wh... what are you doing?

814
00:48:45,800 --> 00:48:47,119
I'm getting out of here... oops

815
00:48:51,000 --> 00:48:52,479
Hold on tight

816
00:48:58,160 --> 00:49:00,628
I like it much better when it stops.

817
00:49:00,680 --> 00:49:02,200
Somebody's going to get hurt with this

818
00:49:02,235 --> 00:49:05,237
I'll hang onto it... it'll be safer that way...

819
00:49:07,320 --> 00:49:08,548
Water!

820
00:49:09,040 --> 00:49:11,429
Do something, Arthur!? Get us out of this!

821
00:49:11,480 --> 00:49:13,914
It looks like you two are going to have
to get me out of this

822
00:49:13,960 --> 00:49:14,915
There's a hole in my boat!

823
00:49:14,960 --> 00:49:17,840
Minimoys... can't swim!

824
00:49:17,875 --> 00:49:18,829
I'm coming to get you, here I come

825
00:49:18,880 --> 00:49:22,350
Arthur! Arthur, please?!

826
00:49:22,400 --> 00:49:23,719
I'm coming... I'm coming. I'm coming.

827
00:49:23,840 --> 00:49:25,239
I know this river.

828
00:49:25,320 --> 00:49:26,719
First there's a bend to the right,

829
00:49:26,760 --> 00:49:29,069
then, there's a sharp bend to the left

830
00:49:31,040 --> 00:49:33,679
so to catch up with them, all I have to do is

831
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:34,914
cut straight across as the crowflies

832
00:49:34,960 --> 00:49:38,475
Sorry, but as the crowflies is as the crowflies

833
00:49:45,680 --> 00:49:47,320
You see. I didn't abandon you

834
00:49:47,355 --> 00:49:47,991
Oh, great! So instead of the two of us drowning,

835
00:49:48,040 --> 00:49:50,800
now all three of us can drown together!

836
00:49:50,835 --> 00:49:51,960
No one's going to drown, Selenia!

837
00:49:51,995 --> 00:49:54,030
Surely, you're not going to let a li'l ol'
river frighten you, are you?

838
00:49:54,080 --> 00:49:57,629
It's not the river I'm frightened of... It's that!

839
00:49:59,080 --> 00:50:02,117
So, Mr. <I'm here>
got any good ideas before we drown?

840
00:50:02,160 --> 00:50:03,149
Sure, course I have

841
00:50:03,400 --> 00:50:03,991
Beta, any chance there's a rope on

842
00:50:04,040 --> 00:50:06,600
that 300 function pocket knife of yours?

843
00:50:06,635 --> 00:50:09,114
Erm, no, that's only on the smaller model

844
00:50:10,680 --> 00:50:12,238
I've got an idea!

845
00:50:12,520 --> 00:50:14,600
Hey, just because we're going to die

846
00:50:14,635 --> 00:50:15,828
doesn't mean you can start taking liberties!

847
00:50:15,880 --> 00:50:17,074
No, you've got it all wrong!

848
00:50:17,120 --> 00:50:19,280
I need the lace to reach that tree, over there

849
00:50:19,315 --> 00:50:20,880
I'm not so sure about this idea of yours

850
00:50:20,915 --> 00:50:21,949
Well, I'm sure!

851
00:50:22,720 --> 00:50:24,600
Arthur
have you ever thrown a sword like that before?

852
00:50:24,635 --> 00:50:26,909
No, but it can't be much more difficult
than playing darts.

853
00:50:27,709 --> 00:50:30,149
Betameche you go first! Selenia you next!

854
00:50:30,184 --> 00:50:31,029
Yes, sir

855
00:50:31,064 --> 00:50:32,587
Your turn Selenia.

856
00:50:33,469 --> 00:50:34,902
Betameche, hurry up!

857
00:50:34,949 --> 00:50:36,462
I can't, I'm slipping!

858
00:50:36,749 --> 00:50:39,468
Selenia, hold on with both hands!

859
00:50:39,509 --> 00:50:41,420
Absolutely no way!

860
00:50:47,549 --> 00:50:48,429
Whew, we're safe!

861
00:50:48,464 --> 00:50:50,420
Not quite!

862
00:50:53,709 --> 00:50:56,469
Come on, Arthur, hurry up
we haven't got all day

863
00:50:56,504 --> 00:50:57,345
I'm coming.

864
00:50:59,149 --> 00:51:01,982
Selenia, you gotta admit it
the guy is pretty agile.

865
00:51:02,029 --> 00:51:04,497
It's easy when you've got both hands free

866
00:51:06,669 --> 00:51:07,658
Thanks

867
00:51:08,429 --> 00:51:10,897
Arthur, you were fantastic!

868
00:51:10,949 --> 00:51:14,180
Right, maybe Mr.
Fantastic can return my lace now?!

869
00:51:15,149 --> 00:51:17,589
It's already so hard without my husband,

870
00:51:17,624 --> 00:51:20,109
I don't know how I'll survive without Arthur

871
00:51:20,144 --> 00:51:21,629
I'm sure he's just run away for a spell.

872
00:51:21,664 --> 00:51:23,309
All of these events have probably upset him

873
00:51:23,344 --> 00:51:24,029
Yes...

874
00:51:24,064 --> 00:51:26,269
I don't think he could have gotten far,

875
00:51:26,304 --> 00:51:27,589
and we've gonna do everything
we can to find him, ma'am.

876
00:51:27,624 --> 00:51:27,869
okay.

877
00:51:27,904 --> 00:51:30,542
You can count on us

878
00:51:49,389 --> 00:51:50,309
What was that?

879
00:51:50,344 --> 00:51:51,109
Humans.

880
00:51:51,144 --> 00:51:51,666
Really?

881
00:51:51,829 --> 00:51:53,865
Yep, sometime it's like that all day long!

882
00:51:53,909 --> 00:51:55,869
Aw, rats, this map's a total washout

883
00:51:55,904 --> 00:51:57,097
How are we ever going to find our way now?

884
00:51:57,149 --> 00:51:59,509
We'll use the position
of the sun to guide us when it comes up

885
00:51:59,544 --> 00:52:01,101
in the meantime, let's look for a place to sleep

886
00:52:01,149 --> 00:52:02,138
And make sure you find us something comfy
Selenia,

887
00:52:02,189 --> 00:52:03,702
'cause I ache all over

888
00:52:03,749 --> 00:52:06,741
Beta, if you complain once more
you can go sleep under a bullmunch.

889
00:52:06,789 --> 00:52:08,269
What's bullmunch?

890
00:52:08,304 --> 00:52:11,067
It's like a gamallus, only much, much bigger.

891
00:52:13,749 --> 00:52:15,309
Beta, I'm going to need your knife.

892
00:52:15,344 --> 00:52:16,185
Coming right up...!

893
00:52:16,829 --> 00:52:18,501
Ummm... Where did they put the METAGLUE?

894
00:52:19,669 --> 00:52:21,068
Whoops... sorry!

895
00:52:21,269 --> 00:52:23,863
Give that to me, Beta!
Before you end up hurting somebody!

896
00:52:23,909 --> 00:52:26,269
Just hang on, I haven't had it very long!
I just got it for my birthday.

897
00:52:26,304 --> 00:52:26,829
How old are you?

898
00:52:26,864 --> 00:52:27,909
I'm three hundred years old...

899
00:52:27,944 --> 00:52:29,989
only another sixty years
and I will be a grown-up

900
00:52:30,024 --> 00:52:31,422
How old's Selenia then?

901
00:52:31,469 --> 00:52:32,743
Almost a thousand years old.

902
00:52:32,789 --> 00:52:33,778
A thousand years old?

903
00:52:33,829 --> 00:52:37,026
Oh, yes... the age of reason...
It's her birthday in two days.

904
00:52:37,069 --> 00:52:40,300
How is this working? Got it!

905
00:52:52,669 --> 00:52:53,385
Whoa.

906
00:52:53,429 --> 00:52:54,748
What's she up to?

907
00:52:54,789 --> 00:52:56,381
She's making the bed.

908
00:52:56,429 --> 00:52:58,897
Wooh, I'm exhausted

909
00:52:59,749 --> 00:53:00,625
Goodnight!

910
00:53:02,429 --> 00:53:04,420
Well, he certainly doesn't having
any trouble sleeping, does he?

911
00:53:04,469 --> 00:53:05,948
It's normal, he's still young.

912
00:53:05,989 --> 00:53:07,149
Three hundred years young! It's not bad!

913
00:53:07,184 --> 00:53:08,298
Ah... so good.

914
00:53:13,829 --> 00:53:19,108
What about you...

915
00:53:19,149 --> 00:53:21,902
are you really going to
be a thousand years old in two days?

916
00:53:21,949 --> 00:53:24,065
Aaah, yes... and in two days time

917
00:53:24,109 --> 00:53:27,629
I am to succeed my father
and watch over the Minimoy people until

918
00:53:27,664 --> 00:53:29,509
it shall come to pass that my own children

919
00:53:29,544 --> 00:53:32,309
reach the age of one thousand
and succeed me

920
00:53:32,344 --> 00:53:33,981
such is the tradition!

921
00:53:34,429 --> 00:53:37,149
But to have children
you need a... husband.

922
00:53:37,184 --> 00:53:38,548
I know, but I'm not worried,

923
00:53:38,589 --> 00:53:42,264
I still have two whole days to find one...
And now...

924
00:53:42,309 --> 00:53:46,700
Goodnight... Arthur!

925
00:53:46,749 --> 00:53:49,707
Goodnight, princess.

926
00:53:59,109 --> 00:54:01,020
Arthur?

927
00:54:35,909 --> 00:54:37,389
Come on, time to get up boys!

928
00:54:37,424 --> 00:54:39,300
We've got a long journey ahead of us today!

929
00:54:45,829 --> 00:54:48,059
Hello, I said, get up

930
00:54:49,389 --> 00:54:51,266
OK! This calls for a change of tactic!

931
00:54:51,309 --> 00:54:53,220
Argh! Ow!

932
00:54:54,149 --> 00:54:55,980
Come on now, shower time!

933
00:54:56,829 --> 00:54:59,024
That's what I call a rude awakening!

934
00:54:59,189 --> 00:54:59,905
Consider yourself lucky!

935
00:54:59,949 --> 00:55:00,540
She's been waking me up
like that every morning

936
00:55:00,589 --> 00:55:03,308
for the last three hundred years!

937
00:55:19,349 --> 00:55:21,029
Mmm... these are even better
than the other ones!

938
00:55:21,064 --> 00:55:21,984
Here, try some!

939
00:55:23,069 --> 00:55:23,749
Mmum... tastes good!

940
00:55:23,784 --> 00:55:24,669
What is it exactly?

941
00:55:24,704 --> 00:55:25,897
Dragonfly eggs

942
00:55:27,109 --> 00:55:28,986
Hey, come and take a look at this!

943
00:55:32,309 --> 00:55:34,220
Oh...! that's awful!

944
00:55:34,789 --> 00:55:38,577
I suppose... uh, seen from this angle...
it is less attractive

945
00:55:38,629 --> 00:55:41,349
Anybody have an idea what this thing is for?!

946
00:55:41,384 --> 00:55:44,068
It's an irrigation system... It transports water

947
00:55:44,109 --> 00:55:45,462
Water! More water!?

948
00:55:45,509 --> 00:55:46,783
I'm... really sorry, I had absolutely no idea that

949
00:55:46,829 --> 00:55:48,182
Wait wait wait, wait a minute,

950
00:55:48,229 --> 00:55:50,509
you mean that you're the one
who built this monstrosity?!

951
00:55:50,544 --> 00:55:53,949
Yes... But I only wanted to water the radishes...
Granny loves radishes

952
00:55:53,984 --> 00:55:56,269
You mean
you actually eat those disgusting things?

953
00:55:56,304 --> 00:55:57,469
Let's just hope that your invention

954
00:55:57,504 --> 00:55:59,669
doesn't fall into the hands of the Evil M

955
00:55:59,704 --> 00:56:02,308
otherwise... I have a pretty good idea
of what he'll do with it.

956
00:56:12,509 --> 00:56:14,469
My straws, they're stealing my straws!

957
00:56:14,504 --> 00:56:15,669
As long as they're getting rid of those things,

958
00:56:15,704 --> 00:56:16,863
I'd say they're doing us a favor.

959
00:56:16,909 --> 00:56:19,109
Try thinking before you talk, Betameche!

960
00:56:19,144 --> 00:56:22,309
The Evil M. knows only too well that
the Minimoys can't stand water,

961
00:56:22,344 --> 00:56:23,189
and your friend, Arthur here,

962
00:56:23,224 --> 00:56:25,749
just provided him
with the means to transport water

963
00:56:25,784 --> 00:56:27,228
where do you suppose he'll send it to?

964
00:56:27,269 --> 00:56:28,702
Oh...! our village!

965
00:56:30,149 --> 00:56:31,629
Arthur, where are you going?

966
00:56:31,664 --> 00:56:33,540
To repair the damage I've done.

967
00:56:34,149 --> 00:56:36,549
I can't believe that guy
humans are really crazy.

968
00:56:36,584 --> 00:56:38,589
That may be, but I think Arthur's right

969
00:56:38,624 --> 00:56:40,898
they're bound to take the straws to Necropolis

970
00:56:40,949 --> 00:56:41,989
...and us along with them

971
00:56:42,024 --> 00:56:43,945
I never get to decide anything!

972
00:56:45,149 --> 00:56:46,829
It's really nice of you to come with me

973
00:56:46,864 --> 00:56:49,502
I'm just worried you're gonna
do something stupid
if I'm not around

974
00:56:53,949 --> 00:56:56,304
Psst! Beta... hurry up!

975
00:57:01,469 --> 00:57:03,061
Beta, your foot!

976
00:57:03,109 --> 00:57:03,869
Oh no!

977
00:57:03,904 --> 00:57:05,541
Here we go again.

978
00:57:07,069 --> 00:57:09,378
Do you know
at least where this waterway leads to?

979
00:57:09,429 --> 00:57:12,102
No! But, in any case
all rivers and waterways meet up at some point!

980
00:57:14,869 --> 00:57:16,860
You always have such brilliant ideas
don't you?!

981
00:57:16,909 --> 00:57:18,309
Don't worry, I'll take care of it
give me back your lace.

982
00:57:18,344 --> 00:57:21,585
Absolutely NO WAY.

983
00:57:22,869 --> 00:57:24,097
Hold on tight!

984
00:57:33,349 --> 00:57:35,260
I hate public transportation!

985
00:57:36,029 --> 00:57:38,145
He's coming this way... He's coming this way!

986
00:57:49,229 --> 00:57:54,869
Hey-oh! Hey... what you playin' at down there?

987
00:57:54,904 --> 00:57:57,829
Uh... if the Seides find us first
we won't have a chance to tell you.

988
00:57:57,864 --> 00:57:59,262
The Seides?

989
00:58:00,909 --> 00:58:01,864
You got a problem?

990
00:58:01,909 --> 00:58:03,228
Nope, it's nothin',

991
00:58:03,269 --> 00:58:04,989
I was just checkin' that
the accordion part ain't damaged

992
00:58:05,024 --> 00:58:06,581
We don't need that part
we're only interested in the stems!

993
00:58:06,629 --> 00:58:08,426
Oh, yeah, the stems, sure thing

994
00:58:08,469 --> 00:58:09,948
Get a move on, the master is waiting

995
00:58:09,989 --> 00:58:13,026
Oh, yeah, the master, sure thing No problemo!

996
00:58:16,589 --> 00:58:18,829
whatever you do
don't move until I come back
and get you, got it?

997
00:58:18,864 --> 00:58:20,308
No problemo!

998
00:58:21,629 --> 00:58:23,469
So where are these refugees of yours?

999
00:58:23,504 --> 00:58:25,585
I've hidden them in a mega discreet place!

1000
00:58:31,989 --> 00:58:32,865
Pretty cool, huh?

1001
00:58:32,909 --> 00:58:35,025
Yup, and mega discreet like you said.

1002
00:58:36,269 --> 00:58:37,941
Jackfire all 'round!

1003
00:58:38,189 --> 00:58:39,941
Yes please! Yes yes yes!

1004
00:58:39,989 --> 00:58:40,989
sure thanks

1005
00:58:41,024 --> 00:58:42,024
Hey, Jack!? Fill 'em up,

1006
00:58:42,069 --> 00:58:43,388
this one's on me!

1007
00:58:45,709 --> 00:58:47,620
oh good

1008
00:58:51,229 --> 00:58:55,507
Long live the Seven Kingdoms!

1009
00:58:56,469 --> 00:59:01,259
Cool!

1010
00:59:01,309 --> 00:59:02,788
Aah! Just what I needed.

1011
00:59:02,829 --> 00:59:05,866
Oh, yep, that hits the spot!

1012
00:59:06,629 --> 00:59:08,426
Ah sorry

1013
00:59:08,469 --> 00:59:10,505
To the Seven Kingdoms!

1014
00:59:16,189 --> 00:59:17,417
That's refreshing stuff!

1015
00:59:17,469 --> 00:59:20,029
As long as you here with me
there's really nothing to fear.

1016
00:59:20,064 --> 00:59:22,029
I'm the boss here. My name is Max.

1017
00:59:22,064 --> 00:59:23,069
Hiya Max!

1018
00:59:23,104 --> 00:59:25,029
And you, young lady, who might you be?

1019
00:59:25,064 --> 00:59:28,309
Selenia.
Daughter of Emperor SIFRAT of MATRADOY,

1020
00:59:28,344 --> 00:59:29,901
the fifteenth of that name
governor of the First Kingdom.

1021
00:59:29,949 --> 00:59:33,737
Wow! Delighted to meet you, baby!

1022
00:59:33,909 --> 00:59:35,900
Jack, same again

1023
00:59:37,709 --> 00:59:39,309
Hey, yo Easylow!

1024
00:59:39,344 --> 00:59:40,749
Yes boss?

1025
00:59:40,784 --> 00:59:42,469
let's get this show on the road!

1026
00:59:42,504 --> 00:59:43,743
You got it!

1027
00:59:47,429 --> 00:59:49,789
May I have the honor of this dance, Princess?

1028
00:59:49,824 --> 00:59:52,462
Selenia? We ought to be making a move
we've still got a long way to go!

1029
00:59:52,509 --> 00:59:53,783
Certainly.

1030
01:00:03,109 --> 01:00:05,869
Pff... she's too old for me anyway!
She's a thousand, I'm only ten!

1031
01:00:05,904 --> 01:00:07,860
What would I want with an older woman?

1032
01:00:12,149 --> 01:00:15,505
What's a good lookin' kid like you doin'
in front of an empty glass?

1033
01:00:15,549 --> 01:00:18,589
well if wasn't empty you couldn't fill it up
could you?

1034
01:00:18,624 --> 01:00:20,386
I like your sense of humor, kid...

1035
01:00:20,429 --> 01:00:23,899
we're gonna get along just fine... Jack!

1036
01:00:24,829 --> 01:00:26,148
Hey hey hey, take it easy

1037
01:00:26,189 --> 01:00:28,862
If you want to find a husband in two days
then, there's no time to lose!

1038
01:00:28,909 --> 01:00:30,669
But, I can help you out if you like...

1039
01:00:30,704 --> 01:00:32,069
That's sweet of you, thanks.

1040
01:00:32,104 --> 01:00:32,909
I like to help out,

1041
01:00:32,944 --> 01:00:34,820
besides which
things are pretty tame right now.

1042
01:00:34,869 --> 01:00:36,541
I only have seven wives.

1043
01:00:36,589 --> 01:00:39,547
Wow! Seven wives? That a...
must take a lot out of you!

1044
01:00:39,589 --> 01:00:41,269
I like hard work,

1045
01:00:41,304 --> 01:00:42,909
I can work night and day seven days a week

1046
01:00:42,944 --> 01:00:45,264
and I never get tired.

1047
01:00:45,309 --> 01:00:46,788
Ah, ah, ah, Wonderful

1048
01:00:48,349 --> 01:00:50,180
So, where do I sign?

1049
01:00:50,229 --> 01:00:53,585
Anywhere you like
kid it doesn't make any difference.

1050
01:00:57,429 --> 01:01:01,707
Excuse me, but...
he's already signed up elsewhere.

1051
01:01:03,469 --> 01:01:07,149
Selenia, it's... are you really gonna
be a thousand years old?

1052
01:01:07,184 --> 01:01:10,749
Yes, but we count the years in Selenielle blooms
Selenielle's the royal flower.

1053
01:01:10,784 --> 01:01:14,669
Ah! OK, Selenielles.
So, how old does that make me?

1054
01:01:14,704 --> 01:01:15,989
about the same age as me!

1055
01:01:16,024 --> 01:01:17,829
Wow, that's amazing!

1056
01:01:17,864 --> 01:01:19,989
And uh... So, before
were you a little girl like me?

1057
01:01:20,024 --> 01:01:20,549
what?

1058
01:01:20,584 --> 01:01:25,949
no, uh I mean, I'm a boy of course
but were you a little girl like the other
little girls in my neighborhood?

1059
01:01:25,984 --> 01:01:29,988
No, I was born as I am...
and I've never set foot outside
the Seven Kingdoms.

1060
01:01:30,029 --> 01:01:32,497
I'd really like to take you to my world one day.

1061
01:01:39,789 --> 01:01:40,665
That's Malthazar!?

1062
01:01:40,709 --> 01:01:43,826
No, lucky for you, it's only Darkos, his son.

1063
01:01:45,749 --> 01:01:48,980
Hey... Darkos this is an honor!

1064
01:01:51,389 --> 01:01:54,829
Hey... Great timing, there's quite a vibe
going down here this evening.

1065
01:01:54,864 --> 01:01:55,818
I can see that."

1066
01:01:55,869 --> 01:01:59,544
Organizing parties without inviting
our friends now are we?

1067
01:01:59,589 --> 01:02:05,221
No way, it wasn't planned
Just a little something we improvised...
to impress the newpunters, you know...

1068
01:02:05,269 --> 01:02:06,668
New faces?

1069
01:02:08,149 --> 01:02:09,901
Warn me if he comes this way

1070
01:02:11,749 --> 01:02:13,944
Hey, Darkos... What's up?

1071
01:02:13,989 --> 01:02:18,189
Selenia... what's a princess of your rank doing
in a place like this?

1072
01:02:18,224 --> 01:02:19,417
I just dropped in for a dance.

1073
01:02:19,469 --> 01:02:22,269
Ah, Well then... let's dance!

1074
01:02:22,304 --> 01:02:23,384
Darkos, sweetheart

1075
01:02:23,429 --> 01:02:26,421
I would rather DIE than dance with you!

1076
01:02:26,469 --> 01:02:27,869
Your wish is my command, Princess!

1077
01:02:27,904 --> 01:02:30,303
you will dance... for all eternity!

1078
01:02:30,869 --> 01:02:32,749
Easylow, get this place rockin

1079
01:02:32,784 --> 01:02:34,341
GET THEM!

1080
01:02:48,949 --> 01:02:50,348
Arthur! Look out!

1081
01:02:52,749 --> 01:02:57,379
Hey, they're putting up a good fight
Let's see if they've got the groove.

1082
01:03:18,749 --> 01:03:20,949
Huh-huh-hun-hun

1083
01:03:20,984 --> 01:03:23,224
h... I think I'll go get some reinforcements

1084
01:03:25,989 --> 01:03:27,502
Hey, I like this kid

1085
01:03:27,749 --> 01:03:29,149
Oh! Three against one, huh?

1086
01:03:29,184 --> 01:03:30,582
Then I'll just triple the power!

1087
01:03:31,149 --> 01:03:31,749
Oh how sweet!

1088
01:03:31,784 --> 01:03:32,943
So... You shouldn't have!

1089
01:03:32,989 --> 01:03:34,786
Really, it was nothing

1090
01:03:38,149 --> 01:03:40,868
Woooh, that's my girl

1091
01:03:45,989 --> 01:03:47,629
Holy gullybars! You scared me!

1092
01:03:47,664 --> 01:03:48,269
What are you doing here?

1093
01:03:48,304 --> 01:03:50,737
I lost my knife, I gotta find something else.

1094
01:03:52,429 --> 01:03:53,498
You find anything?

1095
01:04:02,069 --> 01:04:02,945
my knife!

1096
01:04:05,149 --> 01:04:08,585
Wooh, that's entertainment!

1097
01:04:15,109 --> 01:04:17,862
Easylow, closing time I think!

1098
01:04:19,989 --> 01:04:21,058
Charge.

1099
01:04:21,189 --> 01:04:22,622
CHARGE, MY BUTT.

1100
01:04:26,229 --> 01:04:27,189
Got 'em! There they are!

1101
01:04:27,224 --> 01:04:28,389
I've got one, I got one!

1102
01:04:28,424 --> 01:04:29,709
Let go of me, you idiot!

1103
01:04:29,744 --> 01:04:30,709
Ow! One of them bit me!

1104
01:04:30,744 --> 01:04:31,389
Sorry, boss!

1105
01:04:31,424 --> 01:04:32,583
Somebody turn the lights on!

1106
01:04:37,389 --> 01:04:38,617
What's going on?

1107
01:04:38,669 --> 01:04:41,709
I'm just following your orders
my Lord, ten o'clock curfew!

1108
01:04:41,744 --> 01:04:43,062
and it's ten o'clock! (blows out the smoke)

1109
01:04:44,509 --> 01:04:48,058
Late opening authorization granted!

1110
01:04:48,269 --> 01:04:51,067
cool, real cool!

1111
01:04:51,589 --> 01:04:53,307
Come on man, follow me!

1112
01:04:56,269 --> 01:04:58,624
Look, if you go this way, you'll travel safe!

1113
01:04:59,109 --> 01:05:00,469
Oh, great!

1114
01:05:00,504 --> 01:05:04,064
This is from Max!
it will lead you right to M's quarters.

1115
01:05:08,709 --> 01:05:12,418
Oh, I'm sure glad me ain't goin' along!

1116
01:05:15,749 --> 01:05:17,865
Get out, move aside!

1117
01:05:18,669 --> 01:05:23,345
I... want... them!

1118
01:05:24,429 --> 01:05:25,908
What was that unearthly scream?

1119
01:05:25,949 --> 01:05:28,709
Oh, just Darkos throwing a little temper tantrum.

1120
01:05:28,744 --> 01:05:30,469
Do you think Max will be able to delay him
for long?

1121
01:05:30,504 --> 01:05:34,109
Max is a real smooth talker
I think we can count on him. Come on, let's go

1122
01:05:34,144 --> 01:05:36,669
Oh yeah right, how can you even think about
trusting a guy like that?

1123
01:05:36,709 --> 01:05:40,065
Don't start Betameche!
Just keep walking and shut up, please

1124
01:05:41,269 --> 01:05:42,907
Um...! Wh-w-what's that growling noise?!

1125
01:05:42,949 --> 01:05:44,749
What growling noise? I don't hear anything

1126
01:05:44,784 --> 01:05:46,467
Cut it out, Selenia! I know you're just saying
that to give me the creeps!

1127
01:05:46,509 --> 01:05:47,862
Come on, what was it?

1128
01:05:48,869 --> 01:05:49,540
Oh, no

1129
01:05:49,589 --> 01:05:52,023
he's growling because you woke him up
and now, he's gonna eat you!

1130
01:05:52,069 --> 01:05:53,024
I did?

1131
01:05:53,069 --> 01:05:54,422
Now what did you say...?

1132
01:05:54,469 --> 01:05:55,584
The Yeti?! Really?!

1133
01:06:08,229 --> 01:06:10,424
Surprise

1134
01:06:10,469 --> 01:06:13,427
Well this is... a... surprise

1135
01:06:13,469 --> 01:06:14,788
Where's Arthur?

1136
01:06:14,829 --> 01:06:18,229
In the garden

1137
01:06:18,264 --> 01:06:20,663
In the... In the garden?

1138
01:06:22,189 --> 01:06:22,985
This is it!

1139
01:06:23,069 --> 01:06:26,309
Thank you, Betameche! Without you,
we'd be completely lost!
Now, give me your knife!

1140
01:06:26,344 --> 01:06:27,742
Okay, but don't break it!

1141
01:06:31,149 --> 01:06:32,548
Come on, boys, let's go.

1142
01:06:32,589 --> 01:06:34,029
Mmmm, after you, Selenia!

1143
01:06:34,064 --> 01:06:34,905
Princesses first.

1144
01:06:34,949 --> 01:06:37,702
Men only act like gentlemen when it suits them
huh?

1145
01:06:39,109 --> 01:06:40,019
Hmm

1146
01:06:41,349 --> 01:06:43,863
Well, uh... princes second

1147
01:06:50,669 --> 01:06:52,307
Guess it's my turn,

1148
01:07:00,749 --> 01:07:02,467
what do you mean he disappeared?

1149
01:07:02,509 --> 01:07:07,549
Every night I told him stories
about his Grandpa's adventures in Africa.

1150
01:07:07,584 --> 01:07:11,109
And, last night I told him about the Minimoys

1151
01:07:11,144 --> 01:07:12,337
The Mini what?

1152
01:07:12,389 --> 01:07:17,429
The Minimoys, and, um...
.he became convinced
that they live in our garden.

1153
01:07:17,464 --> 01:07:17,949
In the garden?

1154
01:07:17,984 --> 01:07:19,985
These are just fairy tales and legends, Granny

1155
01:07:20,029 --> 01:07:21,029
Of course, but then,

1156
01:07:21,064 --> 01:07:24,349
since I made the mistake of letting him know
about our money problems,

1157
01:07:24,384 --> 01:07:26,658
he got it into his head to
find the treasure that grandpa hid.

1158
01:07:27,069 --> 01:07:30,778
what treasure?

1159
01:07:32,149 --> 01:07:33,502
Honey
what's the use of finding the treasure
if Arthur isn't here to enjoy it?

1160
01:07:35,949 --> 01:07:41,148
Don't worry, Granny.
I'm sure Arthur will be right back.

1161
01:07:41,189 --> 01:07:44,349
He, he just took a little time off that's all...
No, in the hole

1162
01:07:44,384 --> 01:07:48,137
Sorry!

1163
01:07:48,189 --> 01:07:48,780
not the face!

1164
01:07:48,829 --> 01:07:50,103
Hurry!

1165
01:07:51,069 --> 01:07:52,422
Shhh

1166
01:07:59,429 --> 01:07:59,827
Selenia, it's crawling with Seides!

1167
01:07:59,869 --> 01:08:01,939
Duh... what do you think we're hiding for?

1168
01:08:01,989 --> 01:08:04,423
What are they doing?

1169
01:08:08,629 --> 01:08:09,749
They must be taking food to their Master...
let's follow them

1170
01:08:09,784 --> 01:08:12,502
Do you think he's there?

1171
01:08:18,589 --> 01:08:19,949
Yes!

1172
01:08:19,984 --> 01:08:20,949
Wh-wh-what are we gonna do. Selenia?

1173
01:08:20,984 --> 01:08:22,348
I'm gonna spoil his lunch

1174
01:08:22,389 --> 01:08:25,069
oh... he's not going to like that!

1175
01:08:25,104 --> 01:08:27,264
He feel no cool

1176
01:08:28,829 --> 01:08:29,349
But

1177
01:08:29,384 --> 01:08:32,625
This is where our paths separate, Arthur
I have to deal with this alone

1178
01:08:32,669 --> 01:08:34,068
What do you mean?
I thought we were a team?

1179
01:08:34,109 --> 01:08:37,260
Well, the team is about to split up!
You're gonna go look for your treasure...

1180
01:08:37,469 --> 01:08:38,949
and I'm gonna take care of M...

1181
01:08:38,984 --> 01:08:40,949
If I succeed, we'll meet back here

1182
01:08:40,984 --> 01:08:42,507
If I should fail...

1183
01:08:42,549 --> 01:08:46,909
I bequeath all my powers to you

1184
01:08:46,944 --> 01:08:48,024
What do you mean?

1185
01:08:53,389 --> 01:08:54,829
Be a good king...!

1186
01:08:54,864 --> 01:08:57,184
But, wait... we have to

1187
01:08:57,949 --> 01:08:59,462
Sele-

1188
01:09:00,629 --> 01:09:01,982
Congratulations, Arthur
it was a wonderful (wedding)..."

1189
01:09:02,029 --> 01:09:03,829
really one of the loveliest weddings
I've ever been to! Very moving,

1190
01:09:03,864 --> 01:09:07,949
clear, concise and quick...!

1191
01:09:07,984 --> 01:09:09,064
Yeah... A little too quick.

1192
01:09:09,109 --> 01:09:10,989
Oh, no, you got the most important things,"

1193
01:09:11,024 --> 01:09:11,829
her hand and her heart...

1194
01:09:11,864 --> 01:09:12,629
what more do you want?

1195
01:09:12,664 --> 01:09:15,382
Well, I don't know...
maybe like a party or something?

1196
01:09:15,429 --> 01:09:17,226
If you would allow me the pleasure

1197
01:09:17,269 --> 01:09:20,818
I would love to be
the one to organize that party!

1198
01:09:50,109 --> 01:09:53,067
I spend entire days polishing
that sword to perfection

1199
01:09:53,189 --> 01:09:55,828
I'd recognize that sound anywhere...

1200
01:09:58,669 --> 01:09:59,988
And who else would have been
able to draw the sword

1201
01:10:00,029 --> 01:10:05,626
from the stone besides you, Selenia?

1202
01:10:05,869 --> 01:10:08,258
I am delighted to see you, Princess.

1203
01:10:08,309 --> 01:10:11,709
Likewise! This way I'll be able
to kill you with my own two hands

1204
01:10:11,744 --> 01:10:13,269
Why so much hatred?

1205
01:10:13,304 --> 01:10:14,588
Because you betrayed your own people,"

1206
01:10:14,629 --> 01:10:18,029
slaughtered entire populations
and bound the rest into slavery...

1207
01:10:18,064 --> 01:10:19,149
you're nothing but a monster!

1208
01:10:19,184 --> 01:10:21,069
Speak not of monsters...!

1209
01:10:21,104 --> 01:10:23,503
Nor of things which you are ignorant!

1210
01:10:23,909 --> 01:10:27,389
Back in the time when
I was known as Malthazar the Good,

1211
01:10:27,424 --> 01:10:28,789
Malthazar the Bountiful

1212
01:10:28,824 --> 01:10:31,029
He who watches and protects
I inspired such trust and confidence...

1213
01:10:31,064 --> 01:10:33,549
that when the drought came

1214
01:10:33,584 --> 01:10:36,309
one which lasted a thousand years...

1215
01:10:36,344 --> 01:10:38,629
I was the one they chose for the crusade

1216
01:10:38,664 --> 01:10:40,709
with the task of bringing back water
of course

1217
01:10:40,744 --> 01:10:43,309
but also, all the riches I could reap

1218
01:10:43,344 --> 01:10:46,028
Malthazar the Conqueror!

1219
01:10:46,309 --> 01:10:48,909
How they praised and applauded me when I left

1220
01:10:48,944 --> 01:10:51,829
but I faced every hardship quit alone

1221
01:10:51,864 --> 01:10:56,189
the hostile lands, the ferocious beasts
the bloodthirsty tribes

1222
01:10:56,224 --> 01:10:58,589
lurking in the depths of contaminated plateaus

1223
01:10:58,624 --> 01:11:00,629
where even the humans dare not go

1224
01:11:00,664 --> 01:11:02,829
But I survived all that.

1225
01:11:02,864 --> 01:11:04,509
And having accomplished my mission,"

1226
01:11:04,544 --> 01:11:09,219
I returned to my village... Malthazar the Hero!

1227
01:11:10,549 --> 01:11:15,909
yet, it was not long
before the diseases and bewitchments

1228
01:11:15,944 --> 01:11:18,069
which I had encountered during my voyage began to
disfigure my body

1229
01:11:18,104 --> 01:11:20,589
Fear spread through the people...
fear of contamination...

1230
01:11:20,624 --> 01:11:23,709
people stopped speaking to me

1231
01:11:23,744 --> 01:11:26,069
They crossed the street when I approached...

1232
01:11:26,104 --> 01:11:31,666
and very soon
I became Malthazar... the Evil M!

1233
01:11:32,069 --> 01:11:34,989
Uh, uh. The version recorded in history books
is slightly different.

1234
01:11:35,024 --> 01:11:37,029
It is said that
when you returned from your voyage

1235
01:11:37,064 --> 01:11:38,303
you celebrated for months on end

1236
01:11:38,349 --> 01:11:42,509
each day sinking a little further into
drinking and debauchery

1237
01:11:42,544 --> 01:11:47,709
until you began keeping company
with the worst kinds of insects,

1238
01:11:47,744 --> 01:11:49,669
even poisonous ones..."

1239
01:11:49,704 --> 01:11:50,629
like a certain pretty, young... uh... weevil

1240
01:11:50,664 --> 01:11:51,189
Silence!

1241
01:11:51,224 --> 01:11:53,145
You gave your powers to her
she gave her powers to you!

1242
01:11:53,189 --> 01:11:54,781
That's enough, I tell you!

1243
01:11:56,629 --> 01:11:58,221
I was drunk!

1244
01:11:58,269 --> 01:12:01,309
Ah, well, if you can't hold your liquor
you shouldn't indulge.

1245
01:12:01,344 --> 01:12:03,909
Yes, I know. I let myself go a bit and..."

1246
01:12:03,944 --> 01:12:06,189
it's true, she stole a kiss from me.

1247
01:12:06,224 --> 01:12:09,101
One single kiss which has ruined my entire life.

1248
01:12:09,149 --> 01:12:11,749
Next time, try being a little more selective
in your choice of partner.

1249
01:12:11,784 --> 01:12:16,106
Next time
my partner will be the most beautiful of all

1250
01:12:16,149 --> 01:12:19,389
she whom
I have watched blossom like a delicate flower...

1251
01:12:19,424 --> 01:12:23,587
and whom I have long dreamt of... picking

1252
01:12:23,669 --> 01:12:26,349
Watch yourself...
delicate flowers might have thorns!

1253
01:12:26,384 --> 01:12:29,869
Yes... and this lovely flower alone has
the power to release me

1254
01:12:29,904 --> 01:12:34,589
from the spell that binds me
and make me look like my old self again.

1255
01:12:34,624 --> 01:12:36,869
Only the very first kiss of
a princess has the power

1256
01:12:36,904 --> 01:12:40,339
I know, and... if my information is correct...

1257
01:12:40,389 --> 01:12:42,220
you are still unmarried

1258
01:12:42,269 --> 01:12:45,147
Your information is a little out - of-date.

1259
01:12:46,509 --> 01:12:47,259
Master

1260
01:12:47,309 --> 01:12:48,829
Who dares disturb me?!

1261
01:12:48,864 --> 01:12:51,059
I have news of the utmost urgency
and importance

1262
01:12:51,389 --> 01:12:52,663
Speak up!

1263
01:12:59,149 --> 01:13:02,619
Well, Selenia...
you're more clever than I thought you were.

1264
01:13:02,669 --> 01:13:03,545
Thank you.

1265
01:13:03,589 --> 01:13:06,023
You could have saved my life
but you chose not to

1266
01:13:06,069 --> 01:13:08,629
Don't count on me to spare yours!

1267
01:13:09,909 --> 01:13:12,989
Don't worry, Selenia
you won't die right away

1268
01:13:13,024 --> 01:13:14,661
You'll just suffer a little first,"

1269
01:13:14,709 --> 01:13:17,826
as you watch the destruction
of your people...

1270
01:13:18,629 --> 01:13:20,189
You're a monster, Malthazar!

1271
01:13:20,224 --> 01:13:22,225
I know, I get if from my wife

1272
01:13:22,269 --> 01:13:23,463
Take her away!

1273
01:13:28,829 --> 01:13:31,468
Leave me alone, let me go!

1274
01:13:35,269 --> 01:13:37,309
I'm married five minutes,

1275
01:13:37,344 --> 01:13:38,469
and I already feel like a widower,
and a jailbird!

1276
01:13:38,504 --> 01:13:39,629
We gotta get out of here, Beta..."

1277
01:13:39,664 --> 01:13:40,509
we gotta think of something.

1278
01:13:40,544 --> 01:13:41,749
I'm thinking, Arthur, I'm thinking...!

1279
01:13:41,784 --> 01:13:42,386
The powers...

1280
01:13:42,429 --> 01:13:43,709
what about the powers she gave me
when she kissed me?

1281
01:13:43,744 --> 01:13:44,109
I don't know!

1282
01:13:44,144 --> 01:13:44,829
What do you mean, you don't know!

1283
01:13:44,864 --> 01:13:46,421
Strangling him won't do you any good!

1284
01:13:46,469 --> 01:13:49,541
And besides, you'd better save your energy
if you want to eat!

1285
01:13:50,189 --> 01:13:50,905
What do you mean?

1286
01:13:50,949 --> 01:13:51,949
If you want to eat down here,"

1287
01:13:51,984 --> 01:13:53,869
you'll have to teach them something new
every day,

1288
01:13:53,904 --> 01:13:56,989
otherwise you'll go hungry...
and it makes sense... complete sense...

1289
01:13:57,024 --> 01:13:59,189
knowledge is the one true source of wealth
is it not?!

1290
01:13:59,224 --> 01:14:00,781
What kinds of things do they want to know?

1291
01:14:01,189 --> 01:14:02,224
Pfff... anything will do!

1292
01:14:02,269 --> 01:14:05,149
From the elementary laws of physics to
the behavioral patterns of winkles...

1293
01:14:05,184 --> 01:14:07,749
even how to cook garden peas.
I taught them to write

1294
01:14:07,784 --> 01:14:10,069
And to paint, especially huge canvasses..."

1295
01:14:10,104 --> 01:14:13,349
and to harness light using mirrors
And transport water from
one place to another

1296
01:14:13,384 --> 01:14:15,544
Yes...
that's true, but how did you know all that?

1297
01:14:15,709 --> 01:14:18,860
Because the man who invented all those
wonderful things is my grandfather!

1298
01:14:18,909 --> 01:14:19,659
Arthur?!

1299
01:14:19,709 --> 01:14:20,549
Grandpa!

1300
01:14:20,584 --> 01:14:25,309
Oh my grandson
I'm so happy to see you again!"

1301
01:14:25,344 --> 01:14:27,989
Let me look at you... my, how you've grown!

1302
01:14:28,024 --> 01:14:29,269
It feels more like I've shrunk!

1303
01:14:29,304 --> 01:14:32,229
Yes, that's true.
But how did you manage to get down here?

1304
01:14:32,264 --> 01:14:33,829
Well, I found your riddle

1305
01:14:33,864 --> 01:14:37,349
Oh, yes, of course! My riddle
oh, you are a true hero!

1306
01:14:37,384 --> 01:14:39,589
Hello, Archibald, remember me?

1307
01:14:39,624 --> 01:14:42,269
Betameche?! Is that really you?

1308
01:14:42,304 --> 01:14:44,499
Oh... I'm so happy to see you again..."

1309
01:14:44,549 --> 01:14:45,869
How is your father, that noble king?

1310
01:14:45,904 --> 01:14:47,309
Very well indeed, thank you.

1311
01:14:47,344 --> 01:14:50,858
and your sister, the charming Princess Selenia?

1312
01:14:52,829 --> 01:14:54,148
Selenia!

1313
01:14:54,669 --> 01:14:59,823
I failed, Arthur... I'm sorry, all is lost!

1314
01:14:59,869 --> 01:15:01,589
No, as long as we're still alive"

1315
01:15:01,624 --> 01:15:03,545
and love each other, nothing will ever be lost

1316
01:15:03,589 --> 01:15:05,068
You are so full of hope!

1317
01:15:05,229 --> 01:15:06,829
You can never give up hope."

1318
01:15:06,864 --> 01:15:10,149
Look at me, only yesterday
I was just a small, lonely kid,

1319
01:15:10,184 --> 01:15:12,788
and today, well, I married a princess!

1320
01:15:12,829 --> 01:15:14,820
a happy princess.

1321
01:15:15,349 --> 01:15:19,024
Because she's finally found her prince charming

1322
01:15:22,389 --> 01:15:23,708
W-W-Whoa! Time out!

1323
01:15:23,749 --> 01:15:24,704
I don't mean to be rude,"

1324
01:15:24,749 --> 01:15:27,217
but don't you think you
should maybe respect the tradition...?

1325
01:15:27,589 --> 01:15:30,706
Hey, yes, he's right, what was I thinking?

1326
01:15:30,749 --> 01:15:34,105
Oh, hey, Archibald...! how are you?

1327
01:15:34,149 --> 01:15:35,787
Well, actually... not bad at all, Selenia,"

1328
01:15:35,829 --> 01:15:37,023
what a pleasure to see you again

1329
01:15:37,069 --> 01:15:38,109
Likewise, likewise!

1330
01:15:38,144 --> 01:15:39,949
Selenia, what's this tradition business?

1331
01:15:39,984 --> 01:15:41,507
Once the first kiss has been exchanged,

1332
01:15:41,549 --> 01:15:43,149
then you have to wait another thousand years,

1333
01:15:43,184 --> 01:15:45,185
because then desire
and faith have to be put to the test...

1334
01:15:45,229 --> 01:15:46,821
that which is rare is always valued highly

1335
01:15:46,869 --> 01:15:48,018
She has a point, you know

1336
01:15:48,069 --> 01:15:48,785
And as a Princess,"

1337
01:15:48,829 --> 01:15:51,218
it is my duty to follow
the teachings of the Great Book...

1338
01:15:51,269 --> 01:15:52,782
besides, you ought to do the same,

1339
01:15:52,829 --> 01:15:54,148
instead of trying to steal kisses from me!

1340
01:15:54,189 --> 01:15:56,657
Me? It wasn't me, you were the one

1341
01:15:57,909 --> 01:16:01,982
Come along now, you two lovebirds
it's showtime!

1342
01:16:03,549 --> 01:16:04,584
If you would care to

1343
01:16:04,989 --> 01:16:07,105
Gate open, boss.

1344
01:16:19,109 --> 01:16:20,178
My God...

1345
01:16:20,229 --> 01:16:21,457
When I think that
it was I that taught them all this

1346
01:16:21,509 --> 01:16:23,739
and now they are going to use it against us!

1347
01:16:23,789 --> 01:16:25,905
And when I think
that I was the one who gave them the straws...!

1348
01:16:38,549 --> 01:16:41,382
Look! It's Mino, Miro's son, he's still alive!

1349
01:16:46,669 --> 01:16:47,897
the treasure!

1350
01:16:52,549 --> 01:16:56,869
Ah, Archibald
what a great pleasure it is to see you again...

1351
01:16:56,904 --> 01:16:58,069
The pleasure is all yours.

1352
01:16:58,104 --> 01:16:58,869
So, Archibald
aren't you proud of the marvelous use"

1353
01:16:58,904 --> 01:17:00,229
I've made of your knowledge?

1354
01:17:00,264 --> 01:17:02,269
Looks like a fine structure...

1355
01:17:02,304 --> 01:17:03,179
A shame it's only purpose...

1356
01:17:03,229 --> 01:17:05,909
is to flood the Minimoys!

1357
01:17:05,944 --> 01:17:07,262
Oh, no, not only that..."

1358
01:17:07,309 --> 01:17:08,549
we are going to drown them,

1359
01:17:08,584 --> 01:17:11,269
pulverize them, and destroy them forever.

1360
01:17:11,304 --> 01:17:14,229
They will die in agony
with my name upon their lips

1361
01:17:14,264 --> 01:17:16,709
Look... read my lips

1362
01:17:16,744 --> 01:17:19,589
Mal-tha-zar

1363
01:17:19,624 --> 01:17:20,942
You really are a monster!

1364
01:17:20,989 --> 01:17:23,429
Maybe... but I also know how to be noble!

1365
01:17:23,464 --> 01:17:24,987
You are free

1366
01:17:29,509 --> 01:17:32,589
See?! All you have to do is follow this tunnel

1367
01:17:32,624 --> 01:17:34,022
and you'll be home in no time!

1368
01:17:34,069 --> 01:17:35,707
As soon as we're inside that tunnel
you'll flood it

1369
01:17:35,749 --> 01:17:38,786
My poor Selenia
What a twisted mind you have! Come on

1370
01:17:38,829 --> 01:17:40,709
hurry up, before I change my mind

1371
01:17:40,744 --> 01:17:41,186
Sire?

1372
01:17:41,229 --> 01:17:42,218
What is it now?

1373
01:17:42,269 --> 01:17:45,545
May I ask You Highness to grant me
one last favor before I die

1374
01:17:45,589 --> 01:17:47,420
I like this kid!

1375
01:17:47,469 --> 01:17:48,349
what is this favor?

1376
01:17:48,384 --> 01:17:50,149
I would like to leave my only valued possession,

1377
01:17:50,184 --> 01:17:52,709
this bracelet, to my friend, Mino.

1378
01:17:56,189 --> 01:17:57,144
Granted!

1379
01:17:59,069 --> 01:18:00,787
Your father sent me! I'll get you out of here

1380
01:18:00,829 --> 01:18:03,980
But you need to signal your
position at noon precisely!

1381
01:18:04,189 --> 01:18:05,629
Signal my position, but how?

1382
01:18:05,664 --> 01:18:07,665
Using your mirrors, Mino, mirrors...!

1383
01:18:07,709 --> 01:18:09,062
Oh? Yes! Mmm... mirrors!

1384
01:18:09,109 --> 01:18:09,949
That's enough!

1385
01:18:09,984 --> 01:18:12,669
Patience is the only thing for which
I set myself a limit...!

1386
01:18:12,704 --> 01:18:14,307
At noon... high noon, on the dot!

1387
01:18:14,349 --> 01:18:17,546
I shall allow you a head start of... three minutes.

1388
01:18:21,269 --> 01:18:23,029
I hope the burns in hell!

1389
01:18:23,064 --> 01:18:25,065
He's already there, Selenia, hurry!

1390
01:18:25,229 --> 01:18:26,218
Darkos?

1391
01:18:26,269 --> 01:18:27,149
Yes, father?

1392
01:18:27,184 --> 01:18:29,743
Prepare to open the floodgates

1393
01:18:31,229 --> 01:18:33,140
Is there nothing to nibble?

1394
01:18:34,629 --> 01:18:39,180
I do love something to nibble
on during a good show

1395
01:18:40,189 --> 01:18:43,509
I can't go on...
and what's the point in running anyway?!

1396
01:18:43,544 --> 01:18:44,909
Grandpa... come on, hurry

1397
01:18:44,944 --> 01:18:46,949
You go on!
I'm staying here... to await my death...

1398
01:18:46,984 --> 01:18:49,869
with a little dignity.

1399
01:18:49,904 --> 01:18:51,669
Come on, Grandpa! You can do it

1400
01:18:51,704 --> 01:18:53,909
Arthur! What's the point?
you must face up to it,

1401
01:18:53,944 --> 01:18:55,501
son, we're done for.

1402
01:18:57,709 --> 01:18:59,779
Your Highness, a few tasty tidbits

1403
01:19:03,109 --> 01:19:07,421
Mmm, delicious! Bring me more!

1404
01:19:07,669 --> 01:19:10,137
There must be a solution!
There's always a solution

1405
01:19:10,189 --> 01:19:12,189
The only solution is to pray,"

1406
01:19:12,224 --> 01:19:13,189
my children... pray for a miracle

1407
01:19:13,224 --> 01:19:13,749
The problem is,"

1408
01:19:13,784 --> 01:19:15,546
I've already asked the Great Goddess of
the Forest for so many miracles...

1409
01:19:15,589 --> 01:19:17,261
I'm afraid she might get mad!

1410
01:19:24,509 --> 01:19:25,269
A miracle!

1411
01:19:25,304 --> 01:19:26,389
A miracle, where?!

1412
01:19:26,424 --> 01:19:28,619
Right here, Grandpa, you're sitting on it.

1413
01:19:28,669 --> 01:19:29,818
Look!

1414
01:19:29,989 --> 01:19:31,581
Come and give me a hand...!

1415
01:19:33,349 --> 01:19:34,907
Come on... push!

1416
01:19:35,469 --> 01:19:37,983
Oh

1417
01:19:38,829 --> 01:19:39,978
What is this thing?

1418
01:19:40,029 --> 01:19:43,149
It's a car.
It's a Ferrari 250 GTI 12-cylinder...!

1419
01:19:43,184 --> 01:19:44,069
It's a birthday present!

1420
01:19:44,104 --> 01:19:45,469
Don't tell me you know how to drive that thing?

1421
01:19:45,504 --> 01:19:46,589
Of course I do!

1422
01:19:46,624 --> 01:19:47,783
If the young lady would care to step this way

1423
01:19:47,829 --> 01:19:49,342
Oh God, whatever!

1424
01:19:54,709 --> 01:19:55,744
Bingo!

1425
01:20:12,869 --> 01:20:14,029
Hurry, Arthur, please get in!

1426
01:20:14,064 --> 01:20:15,098
If we want make it the whole way,"

1427
01:20:15,149 --> 01:20:16,469
we have to wind it up as far as it will go.

1428
01:20:16,504 --> 01:20:17,589
Arthur, the water is coming!

1429
01:20:17,624 --> 01:20:19,069
Hurry, Arthur, please.

1430
01:20:19,104 --> 01:20:19,749
Got it!

1431
01:20:19,784 --> 01:20:21,949
this is the first time I've ever taken
a girl out for a drive, you know!

1432
01:20:21,984 --> 01:20:24,144
Well, let's just hope it won't
be the last... Step on it!

1433
01:20:24,349 --> 01:20:26,146
We're off!

1434
01:20:28,309 --> 01:20:30,186
Faster!

1435
01:20:34,989 --> 01:20:36,269
I just hope there aren't any speed
cameras down here,"

1436
01:20:36,304 --> 01:20:37,389
or we've had it!

1437
01:20:37,424 --> 01:20:38,868
Hey, go to the left!

1438
01:20:42,429 --> 01:20:45,589
I'd appreciate a little more warning
next time if that's OK with you?

1439
01:20:45,624 --> 01:20:47,227
OK, Turn right.

1440
01:20:49,549 --> 01:20:50,982
Which way do I go now, left or right?

1441
01:20:51,029 --> 01:20:52,303
Down!

1442
01:20:55,869 --> 01:20:57,309
Selenia... I... I don't feel so good!

1443
01:20:57,344 --> 01:21:00,221
Just hang in there, the road is smoother now.

1444
01:21:09,509 --> 01:21:10,225
Arthur

1445
01:21:10,269 --> 01:21:12,021
Honey, do you hear that strange noise?"

1446
01:21:12,069 --> 01:21:13,343
It sounds like
there's running water underneath.

1447
01:21:13,389 --> 01:21:16,859
Oh great, now you're hearing voice
just like Joan of Arc did?"

1448
01:21:16,909 --> 01:21:18,706
Next thing you know you're gonna
be seeing little angels

1449
01:21:18,749 --> 01:21:23,106
and great big ghosts
with spears and armor coming after you

1450
01:21:23,149 --> 01:21:24,946
Wait wait, you might want to turn around,"

1451
01:21:24,989 --> 01:21:28,220
there's, there's large men
with necklaces and feathers

1452
01:21:29,029 --> 01:21:30,428
and I don't know... I...

1453
01:21:31,269 --> 01:21:32,782
What the...

1454
01:21:37,509 --> 01:21:38,339
What time is it?

1455
01:21:38,389 --> 01:21:40,425
The time?! sure!

1456
01:21:40,469 --> 01:21:41,909
According to our calculations,"

1457
01:21:41,944 --> 01:21:44,787
the water should hit the village in three balls time.

1458
01:21:45,709 --> 01:21:47,222
What time is it, my dear Miro?

1459
01:21:47,269 --> 01:21:48,829
Five to noon, my good king.

1460
01:21:48,864 --> 01:21:51,029
Only five minutes left and still... no news.

1461
01:21:51,064 --> 01:21:51,989
Have faith in them, my good king..."

1462
01:21:52,024 --> 01:21:53,422
I am sure that they will succeed.

1463
01:21:53,469 --> 01:21:56,779
May the Gods hear you
Miro, may the gods hear you...

1464
01:22:06,829 --> 01:22:08,660
Look, there's the gate!

1465
01:22:08,709 --> 01:22:09,425
Yes

1466
01:22:09,629 --> 01:22:12,348
We made it!

1467
01:22:12,909 --> 01:22:18,029
Arthur
you're not going break down on us now?!

1468
01:22:18,069 --> 01:22:20,583
Sorry
I guess we're gonna have to get out and... RUN!

1469
01:22:24,389 --> 01:22:26,061
What is that rumbling noise?

1470
01:22:26,109 --> 01:22:28,782
I have no idea, Sire
but I have a terrible foreboding

1471
01:22:29,309 --> 01:22:31,629
Father, it's me, Selenia!

1472
01:22:31,664 --> 01:22:33,229
My daughter... they have returned!

1473
01:22:33,264 --> 01:22:35,869
Open the gate!

1474
01:22:35,904 --> 01:22:37,939
Open the gate now!

1475
01:22:44,149 --> 01:22:45,298
Close the gate immediately!

1476
01:22:45,349 --> 01:22:47,269
Open it, close it, make up your mind

1477
01:22:47,304 --> 01:22:49,419
All together now!

1478
01:23:00,469 --> 01:23:02,189
You did it daddy, you did it!"

1479
01:23:02,224 --> 01:23:05,549
You are now the uncontested Master
of all the Kingdoms!

1480
01:23:05,584 --> 01:23:06,589
Heaven knows,"

1481
01:23:06,624 --> 01:23:08,989
I don't care about titles and honors,

1482
01:23:09,024 --> 01:23:12,589
but I must admit that it does feel good
to be Supreme Ruler.

1483
01:23:12,624 --> 01:23:14,261
Let us prepare ourselves.

1484
01:23:17,269 --> 01:23:18,829
The gate looks as if it will hold.

1485
01:23:18,864 --> 01:23:19,669
Not for long!

1486
01:23:19,704 --> 01:23:20,229
It will!

1487
01:23:20,264 --> 01:23:21,509
Oh, my children!

1488
01:23:21,544 --> 01:23:21,789
Papa!

1489
01:23:21,824 --> 01:23:22,904
Daddy!

1490
01:23:23,949 --> 01:23:25,309
We missed you, Papa

1491
01:23:25,344 --> 01:23:26,105
Oh, my children,"

1492
01:23:26,149 --> 01:23:28,458
what a joy it is to
have you back safe and sound!

1493
01:23:49,909 --> 01:23:50,898
What's wrong?

1494
01:23:52,549 --> 01:23:55,427
No, the phone's cut off, it doesn't work."

1495
01:23:55,469 --> 01:23:56,822
What is wrong?!

1496
01:23:57,349 --> 01:23:58,907
AHHHH... Ou... out there!

1497
01:23:58,949 --> 01:23:59,909
What's out there?

1498
01:23:59,944 --> 01:24:00,580
Five!

1499
01:24:00,629 --> 01:24:01,459
Five what?

1500
01:24:01,509 --> 01:24:02,828
Blllllaaaaaack!

1501
01:24:02,869 --> 01:24:04,507
What are you talking about?

1502
01:24:04,549 --> 01:24:05,538
Huge!
(panicky whispers, then, LOUD)

1503
01:24:05,669 --> 01:24:06,499
Where're you going?"

1504
01:24:06,549 --> 01:24:08,665
Don't leave me here, no Granny please!

1505
01:24:11,629 --> 01:24:13,938
it's noon!

1506
01:24:14,749 --> 01:24:16,262
In one minute!

1507
01:24:17,349 --> 01:24:19,829
Hurry now, you only have one minute

1508
01:24:19,864 --> 01:24:21,109
Arthur, I must confess we'd..."

1509
01:24:21,144 --> 01:24:23,464
well we'd pretty much lost all hope,

1510
01:24:23,509 --> 01:24:25,386
but you've brought my children back to me!

1511
01:24:25,429 --> 01:24:27,897
And the Minimoys
will be eternally grateful to you.

1512
01:24:29,149 --> 01:24:32,186
And a second turn of the wheel for the spirit

1513
01:24:32,429 --> 01:24:34,589
Thank you for everything,"

1514
01:24:34,624 --> 01:24:36,068
my friend. Take good care of my son-in-law.

1515
01:24:36,109 --> 01:24:39,101
Sure, and you, you take good care of"

1516
01:24:41,389 --> 01:24:42,708
my granddaughter-in-law.

1517
01:24:42,749 --> 01:24:43,977
It's going to pretty dull around here
without you!

1518
01:24:44,029 --> 01:24:44,789
Come back soon, huh?

1519
01:24:44,824 --> 01:24:47,667
At the tenth moon, that's promise.

1520
01:24:51,709 --> 01:24:54,348
Ten moons, that gives us plenty
of time to put our desire

1521
01:24:54,389 --> 01:24:56,949
to the test and respect the protocol!

1522
01:24:56,989 --> 01:24:59,787
To hell with the protocol!

1523
01:25:01,669 --> 01:25:04,388
and a third turn of the wheel for the soul.

1524
01:25:21,949 --> 01:25:25,578
See you... ten moons!

1525
01:25:29,189 --> 01:25:34,229
Thank you! You okay? Yeah, thanks!

1526
01:25:34,264 --> 01:25:35,429
Mom?

1527
01:25:35,464 --> 01:25:37,349
Mom...! Mom?

1528
01:25:37,384 --> 01:25:40,307
Honey, what, get out... what...

1529
01:25:43,069 --> 01:25:46,749
oh! Arthur! where have you been?

1530
01:25:46,784 --> 01:25:47,669
I was with the Minimoys

1531
01:25:47,704 --> 01:25:49,029
The Min... Miniwhat?

1532
01:25:49,064 --> 01:25:50,429
The Minimoys!

1533
01:25:50,464 --> 01:25:54,309
Oooh... Ha, ha!

1534
01:25:54,344 --> 01:25:55,709
Mom?!

1535
01:25:55,744 --> 01:25:56,983
Oh Granpa!

1536
01:25:57,869 --> 01:25:59,389
Are you okay?

1537
01:25:59,424 --> 01:26:02,869
My brothers!
Oh I'm so glad to see you again!

1538
01:26:02,904 --> 01:26:08,829
Grandpa! We've got no time left
we gotta go!

1539
01:26:08,864 --> 01:26:10,706
You're right

1540
01:26:12,229 --> 01:26:14,549
Noon on the dot!

1541
01:26:14,584 --> 01:26:16,589
and no one in sight!

1542
01:26:16,624 --> 01:26:19,029
I'm afraid
though it is a beautiful Sunday

1543
01:26:19,064 --> 01:26:20,749
despite it being the day of our Lord...

1544
01:26:20,784 --> 01:26:24,344
there seems to be no miracle! So

1545
01:26:25,669 --> 01:26:28,469
You're right Davido

1546
01:26:28,504 --> 01:26:30,149
it is a beautiful, beautiful Sunday!

1547
01:26:30,184 --> 01:26:31,589
I believe we have some papers to sign

1548
01:26:31,624 --> 01:26:32,629
am I right?

1549
01:26:32,664 --> 01:26:33,589
Let's go in the living room,

1550
01:26:33,624 --> 01:26:35,102
we'll be more comfortable!

1551
01:26:40,469 --> 01:26:41,709
While I try to buy time,

1552
01:26:41,744 --> 01:26:42,629
you get busy finding the treasure

1553
01:26:42,664 --> 01:26:43,778
OK!

1554
01:26:51,509 --> 01:26:56,789
Mino, Mino where are you? Mino!

1555
01:26:56,824 --> 01:26:59,428
This is not gonna be easy!

1556
01:27:04,069 --> 01:27:05,548
Light!

1557
01:27:28,069 --> 01:27:30,749
I promised you riches and power

1558
01:27:30,784 --> 01:27:33,709
And Malthazar always keeps his promises.

1559
01:27:33,744 --> 01:27:35,709
nothing can stop us now!

1560
01:27:35,744 --> 01:27:38,746
The Seven Kingdoms are... mine!

1561
01:27:40,629 --> 01:27:42,460
I mean, of course, ours

1562
01:27:46,389 --> 01:27:47,749
What?

1563
01:27:47,784 --> 01:27:48,909
Excuse me,

1564
01:27:48,944 --> 01:27:50,029
could you tell me what time it is,

1565
01:27:50,064 --> 01:27:51,826
I'm kinda far-sighted

1566
01:27:52,869 --> 01:27:54,509
NOON!

1567
01:27:54,544 --> 01:27:55,589
Thank you!

1568
01:27:55,624 --> 01:27:57,909
My fearless and faithful warriors!

1569
01:27:57,944 --> 01:28:00,582
...let the festivities begin.

1570
01:28:05,069 --> 01:28:06,709
Now if I do the exact opposite,

1571
01:28:06,744 --> 01:28:09,667
the light which reflects downwards should
then reflect... upwards!

1572
01:28:17,869 --> 01:28:19,985
Mino! You're the best.

1573
01:28:22,349 --> 01:28:24,189
But what is he doing? Darkos!?

1574
01:28:24,224 --> 01:28:25,869
That idiot will give our position away!

1575
01:28:25,904 --> 01:28:27,507
Make him cut that beam immediately!

1576
01:28:27,989 --> 01:28:29,389
Cut the beam!

1577
01:28:29,424 --> 01:28:31,429
Huh? Uh, sorry, because I'm far sighted,

1578
01:28:31,464 --> 01:28:32,429
but I'm also hard of hearing!

1579
01:28:32,464 --> 01:28:37,503
You fool! You will be sorry
that you defied Malthazar!

1580
01:28:42,909 --> 01:28:44,024
Oh, it's nothing, really!

1581
01:28:44,269 --> 01:28:45,469
Bring him here!

1582
01:28:45,504 --> 01:28:48,069
Watch out! I can get really nasty!

1583
01:28:48,104 --> 01:28:50,299
Sure you can... come on, show us!

1584
01:29:06,869 --> 01:29:08,429
WHAT IS THIS THING?

1585
01:29:08,464 --> 01:29:12,502
I know, I know... Oh gracious Lord
it's a kind of

1586
01:29:33,389 --> 01:29:34,469
Damn!

1587
01:29:34,504 --> 01:29:39,987
Father! What shall I do?
What about me, father?

1588
01:29:45,429 --> 01:29:48,549
As for you, my son...

1589
01:29:48,584 --> 01:29:52,144
I hereby solemnly appoint you Commander
of the Imperial Forces!

1590
01:29:52,509 --> 01:29:54,109
Oh... thank you, father, that's nice

1591
01:29:54,144 --> 01:29:55,709
but... you wouldn't have a place left
on that mosquito of yours,

1592
01:29:55,744 --> 01:29:56,549
would you?!

1593
01:29:56,584 --> 01:29:58,938
A Commander never deserts his post...!

1594
01:30:01,509 --> 01:30:05,104
Father... Daddy!?

1595
01:30:09,829 --> 01:30:17,747
Mino? Yes!

1596
01:30:22,429 --> 01:30:24,029
More coffee?

1597
01:30:24,064 --> 01:30:26,229
No! No more coffee! Thank you!

1598
01:30:26,264 --> 01:30:28,509
But what I would love is
for you to sign the paper!

1599
01:30:28,544 --> 01:30:31,023
Of course, what did I do with my pen?

1600
01:30:33,429 --> 01:30:34,909
Oh what a lovely pen!

1601
01:30:34,944 --> 01:30:36,389
We have wasted enough time.

1602
01:30:36,424 --> 01:30:37,429
Sign!

1603
01:30:37,464 --> 01:30:38,544
Of course.

1604
01:30:44,309 --> 01:30:48,229
And now... the money!

1605
01:30:48,264 --> 01:30:51,989
Hm? Oh the money, yes!

1606
01:30:52,024 --> 01:30:54,109
I'd like to see how you're going to
pull one of your tricks now!

1607
01:30:54,144 --> 01:30:55,508
Here!

1608
01:30:57,549 --> 01:30:59,221
Bravo my boy!

1609
01:31:03,389 --> 01:31:10,340
So then...
good accounts make for good friends
isn't that right?

1610
01:31:10,789 --> 01:31:14,065
There you are, paid in full!

1611
01:31:20,509 --> 01:31:22,549
Sir, I must now be saying goodbye!

1612
01:31:22,584 --> 01:31:23,709
Good bye now.

1613
01:31:23,744 --> 01:31:25,825
Good bye!

1614
01:31:36,469 --> 01:31:37,743
Congratulations!

1615
01:31:38,789 --> 01:31:39,909
Nobody move!

1616
01:31:39,944 --> 01:31:41,706
I said!

1617
01:31:48,349 --> 01:31:50,949
So that's why you
had your sights set on this land?

1618
01:31:50,984 --> 01:31:54,189
Of course! The call of greed
now and forever!

1619
01:31:54,224 --> 01:31:55,589
One night you had a few too many,

1620
01:31:55,624 --> 01:31:57,229
and you told me about this treasure,

1621
01:31:57,264 --> 01:31:59,549
and ever since
I have not had a good night's sleep!

1622
01:31:59,584 --> 01:32:01,509
But now, it's mine!

1623
01:32:01,544 --> 01:32:03,909
Thanks kid! Nice job!

1624
01:32:03,944 --> 01:32:05,189
Well, I'll be saying my farewells,

1625
01:32:05,224 --> 01:32:07,469
you won't be seeing me ever again!

1626
01:32:07,504 --> 01:32:11,747
Because, I am going far, far away!

1627
01:32:12,909 --> 01:32:15,628
You're coming with me! C'mon!

1628
01:32:16,109 --> 01:32:18,589
Get your hands off me. I know the governor!

1629
01:32:18,624 --> 01:32:19,942
Yeah, so do I

1630
01:32:23,309 --> 01:32:24,949
I'll take that. I'll take that.

1631
01:32:24,984 --> 01:32:25,669
Next time...

1632
01:32:25,704 --> 01:32:27,309
please put your gift in a safer place.

1633
01:32:27,344 --> 01:32:28,029
That's a promise.

1634
01:32:28,064 --> 01:32:31,339
I'll take it. It's much safer with me.

1635
01:32:53,149 --> 01:32:54,628
Don't worry Mino,

1636
01:32:54,669 --> 01:32:56,387
I'm gonna care of you.

1637
01:33:04,709 --> 01:33:06,347
They did it!

1638
01:33:06,749 --> 01:33:13,939
Yes, he made it!

1639
01:33:17,509 --> 01:33:20,909
Howl would have loved
my little Mino to see this!

1640
01:33:20,944 --> 01:33:22,549
I understand Miro,

1641
01:33:22,584 --> 01:33:24,389
but our people are safe and sound...

1642
01:33:24,424 --> 01:33:26,509
and that is something to be thankful for

1643
01:33:26,544 --> 01:33:28,067
Of course. of course.

1644
01:33:35,629 --> 01:33:38,666
Wait, I think I know what it is

1645
01:33:41,069 --> 01:33:42,627
Hey, it's Mino!

1646
01:33:42,749 --> 01:33:44,467
Mino, my son!

1647
01:33:45,509 --> 01:33:48,626
Papa!

1648
01:33:50,269 --> 01:33:51,099
Well, there you go!

1649
01:33:52,429 --> 01:33:52,941
All's well that ends well!

1650
01:33:53,749 --> 01:33:54,022
Not quite...

1651
01:33:56,909 --> 01:33:57,546
May I?

1652
01:34:34,109 --> 01:34:36,829
I think it's ready... Excuse me...

1653
01:34:36,864 --> 01:34:39,627
Waited so long for this moment

1654
01:34:44,509 --> 01:34:46,709
I propose a toast!

1655
01:34:46,744 --> 01:34:48,749
Here, here!

1656
01:34:48,784 --> 01:34:50,262
Here it comes!

1657
01:34:51,389 --> 01:34:53,549
What's that?

1658
01:34:53,584 --> 01:34:54,709
My favorite dish!

1659
01:34:54,744 --> 01:34:56,669
African giraffe's neck!

1660
01:34:56,704 --> 01:34:57,658
What?

1661
01:35:01,589 --> 01:35:04,629
Honey! Honey! Rosie!

1662
01:35:04,664 --> 01:35:05,857
Wake up, honey!

1663
01:35:07,029 --> 01:35:09,782
Every time she gets a little excited
over she goes!

1664
01:35:12,589 --> 01:35:14,068
Where's Arthur?

1665
01:35:14,869 --> 01:35:16,989
He, he just went to wash up.

1666
01:35:17,024 --> 01:35:18,308
He'll be back in a jiffy!

1667
01:35:33,629 --> 01:35:36,746
only ten more moons, Selenia

1668
01:35:52,069 --> 01:35:53,388
I will wait for you.
