Sit down.

375
00:17:21,791 --> 00:17:21,519
You see this?

376
00:17:21,569 --> 00:17:23,174
This means
that this year

377
00:17:23,224 --> 00:17:24,278
is going to be
different.

378
00:17:24,624 --> 00:17:26,960
This year is going to be
about more than school.

379
00:17:27,457 --> 00:17:30,981
This year, we are going
to be a family.

380
00:17:31,257 --> 00:17:32,301

and you are going
to be my family,

384
00:17:40,224 --> 00:17:42,957

that i am not leaving,

385
00:17:43,024 --> 00:17:46,224

397
00:18:50,723 --> 00:18:52,957
Ohh!
Whoa.

Yo...

401
00:19:02,524 --> 00:19:03,624
We think

Who vandalized
this room?

403
00:19:06,360 --> 00:19:07,224
I did, sir.

404
00:19:11,060 --> 00:19:11,614
Mr. Clark...

405
00:19:13,127 --> 00:19:15,494
this sort of stunt
may have gone over big
in aurora,

406
00:19:15,561 --> 00:19:17,327
but it doesn't work
for me.

407
00:19:17,394 --> 00:19:20,827
My school.
My rules.

They're
just testing you.

427

They want to see
if you really care.

428

See if i care?
They weren't even
looking at me.

429
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:12,599
Well, one of them was,

430
00:20:12,649 --> 00:20:14,264
but i think
he was picturing me
in a dark alley.

431
00:20:14,314 --> 00:20:15,061
We have to turn this...

All right.

I think it looks
good right there.

437
00:20:23,381 --> 00:20:24,714
You know, school's
supposed to be exciting.

438
00:20:25,714 --> 00:20:25,828
Ok.

439
00:20:27,414 --> 00:20:29,247
Now you sound like one
of those dumb-ass
commercials

440
00:20:29,314 --> 00:20:30,680
that used to come on
at the cartoons
on saturday morning.

441
00:20:30,730 --> 00:20:31,912
So, what? You didn't
like school?

442
00:20:33,004 --> 00:20:34,540
School sucked.
I hated it.

443
00:20:35,738 --> 00:20:36,254
Yeah, well,
if i was your teacher,

444
00:20:36,604 --> 00:20:37,461

I mean, we're not
living together

Oh, so, you're
a union mover.

Can i have
your attention, please?

Before we start today,
i would like to go over
3 rules for this class.

If you follow them,
we will all have
a lot of fun.

All right!

473
00:21:56,797 --> 00:21:58,363

there will be consequences.

If you are asked
a question,

00:22:28,164 --> 00:22:30,465
you will say, "yes, sir,"
or, "no, sir,"

489
00:22:30,531 --> 00:22:34,565

no smacking of lips
and rolling of the eyes.

507

If you break one
of these rules,

508

your name will
go up on the board.

509

So stupid!

510
00:23:17,793 --> 00:23:20,527
If you break
another rule,

511
00:23:20,592 --> 00:23:22,126
you will get a check.

like a mighty stream.

542
00:24:30,513 --> 00:24:33,845
It's like on a hot day
when you go outside,

543
00:24:33,912 --> 00:24:36,079
and "whoosh!" somebody
opens up a fire hydrant,

544
00:24:36,146 --> 00:24:37,912
and there's water
streaming all over
the place!

545
00:24:37,979 --> 00:24:40,146
And everybody's runnin'
around and going crazy.

546
00:24:40,213 --> 00:24:45,646
That's what dr. King
wanted justice and
freedom to feel like.

547
00:24:45,712 --> 00:24:49,812
So, tonight, after
we've gone over
dr. King's speech,

548
00:24:49,879 --> 00:24:51,580
i want you all
to start a journal

549
00:24:51,646 --> 00:24:54,546
about your dreams
and aspirations.

550
00:24:54,613 --> 00:24:56,845
[Bell rings]

551
00:24:58,712 --> 00:24:59,479
Hey, man,
it's locked!
What's up?

552
00:24:59,546 --> 00:25:01,900
Rule number 3... we all lin up
to go to the lunch room.

553
00:25:03,912 --> 00:25:05,879
[Class groaning]

554
00:25:05,590 --> 00:25:06,925
You know what?
Here's my rule...

555
00:25:06,975 --> 00:25:08,926
i ain't standin'
in no line.

556
00:25:09,308 --> 00:25:11,198
Oh, ok, shameika.

557
00:25:12,108 --> 00:25:14,442
But because we are
all a family,

558
00:25:14,508 --> 00:25:17,375
if one of us
doesn't get in line
for the lunch room,

559
00:25:17,442 --> 00:25:19,175
then none of us
gets lunch.

560
00:25:19,242 --> 00:25:21,141
[All shouting at once]

561
00:25:21,208 --> 00:25:23,275
I'm starving!

562
00:25:23,342 --> 00:25:26,609
Mr. Clark!
We're starving!

563
00:25:27,709 --> 00:25:28,575
Shameika,
just do it.

564
00:25:28,642 --> 00:25:29,874
I'm hungry.
Yeah.

565
00:25:32,874 --> 00:25:35,375
[Sighs]

566
00:25:36,675 --> 00:25:41,075
Very quietly,
2 lines, right up
against the wall.

567
00:25:41,141 --> 00:25:43,221
That's good.

568
00:25:43,375 --> 00:25:47,108
That's good.
Nice and quiet.

569
00:25:47,175 --> 00:25:52,442
Oh, looks like
somebody's not hungry.

570
00:25:52,508 --> 00:25:55,342
Stop fighting. Let's go.

571
00:25:59,375 --> 00:26:01,508
No talking.

572
00:26:06,041 --> 00:26:06,778
And stop.

573
00:26:09,221 --> 00:26:10,271
Shameika, did you
cut in line?

574
00:26:10,371 --> 00:26:12,677
No, sir. I did not.

575
00:26:14,471 --> 00:26:16,037
You do know that
i have eyes

576
00:26:16,104 --> 00:26:17,304
in the back
of my head, right?

577
00:26:17,371 --> 00:26:19,970
I was here! Ask her.

578
00:26:21,271 --> 00:26:23,471
Stupid...

579
00:26:25,171 --> 00:26:27,171
all right, we're all
gonna stand here

580
00:26:27,237 --> 00:26:30,437
until shameika decides
to tell the truth.

581
00:26:30,504 --> 00:26:32,371
Come on, mr. Clark!

582
00:26:32,437 --> 00:26:33,937
What?

583
00:26:34,004 --> 00:26:36,970
I didn't cut
in no line!

584
00:26:40,437 --> 00:26:44,371
Hey, you're in mr. Clark's
class. No food.

585
00:26:44,437 --> 00:26:46,137
Huh?

586
00:26:48,471 --> 00:26:49,870
Yo, come on, mr. Clark,
i'm starving, man!

587
00:26:49,937 --> 00:26:51,204
I'm about to faint,
i'm fallin' down...

588
00:26:50,271 --> 00:26:51,424
julio, get to the back
of the line.

589
00:26:52,070 --> 00:26:54,101
And take that hat off.

590
00:26:57,904 --> 00:27:01,604
It's up to you
whether we eat or not.

591
00:27:06,670 --> 00:27:08,904
Shameika,
this is a family,

592
00:27:08,970 --> 00:27:11,437
and families treat
each other with respect.

593
00:27:11,504 --> 00:27:14,770
They never, ever,
lie to one another.

594
00:27:17,904 --> 00:27:19,937
Did you cut in line?

595
00:27:23,004 --> 00:27:25,048
Come on, meka!
Come on. Let's go!

596
00:27:32,070 --> 00:27:34,970
We are all
just waiting...

597
00:27:35,037 --> 00:27:36,638
on you.

598
00:27:40,137 --> 00:27:41,737
Yeah.

599
00:27:42,803 --> 00:27:44,538
Thank you.

600
00:27:46,703 --> 00:27:49,271
Now, what is
rule number 5?

601
00:27:49,337 --> 00:27:52,404
All: No cutting
in line.

602
00:27:52,471 --> 00:27:54,770
That's right.
Now go eat.

603
00:27:54,271 --> 00:27:55,243
About time!

604
00:27:56,337 --> 00:27:58,571
I'm proud of you.

605
00:27:58,638 --> 00:28:00,571
Thanks a lot,
shameika.

606
00:28:04,004 --> 00:28:06,638
Uh-huh. Yes, mom,
i miss you, too.

607
00:28:08,437 --> 00:28:10,670
Yeah, i know there's
a job for me back home,

608
00:28:10,737 --> 00:28:13,104
but, uh, things are
going very well here.

609
00:28:14,004 --> 00:28:14,954
Well, it took the kids

610
00:28:15,004 --> 00:28:17,698
a little while
to warm up to me. Yeah.

611
00:28:18,996 --> 00:28:20,618
Honestly, we're
getting along great.

612
00:29:14,695 --> 00:29:16,864
I want you all to take
a good look around

613
00:29:16,914 --> 00:29:19,342
at your new, clean room.

614
00:29:20,814 --> 00:29:21,766
Whatever.

615
00:29:23,847 --> 00:29:27,513
I'm not going to ask
who wrecked it.

616
00:29:28,547 --> 00:29:30,580
Eyes right here.

617
00:29:33,780 --> 00:29:37,747
I was hoping we could
have fun this year,

618
00:29:37,814 --> 00:29:39,847
and i think
that we still can,

619
00:29:39,914 --> 00:29:44,847
but only after you learn
to follow all of my rules.

620
00:29:44,914 --> 00:29:46,247
[Smacks gum]

621
00:29:46,314 --> 00:29:51,314
And you will follow
all of my rules.

622
00:29:51,381 --> 00:29:53,814
[All smacking gum]

623
00:29:53,880 --> 00:29:56,314
First of all,
he a freak.

624
00:29:56,381 --> 00:29:58,814
"Take your seats,
call me sir."

625
00:29:58,880 --> 00:29:59,265
Too many damn rules,
man.

626
00:30:00,405 --> 00:30:01,608
Telling us how to do
this and do that,

627
00:30:02,404 --> 00:30:03,904
making us walk around
in a damn line.

628
00:30:04,504 --> 00:30:05,206
He ain't my daddy.

629
00:30:05,256 --> 00:30:06,960
He could be your daddy.
You don't know.

630
00:30:07,589 --> 00:30:08,664
You should talk, girl.

631
00:30:09,489 --> 00:30:09,967
Excuse me.

632
00:30:10,017 --> 00:30:12,334
Shut up.
All i'm saying is,

633
00:30:12,383 --> 00:30:13,993
this is our school,
all right?

634
00:30:14,316 --> 00:30:15,616
We do what we wanna.

635
00:30:15,683 --> 00:30:18,017
Yeah, 'cause he's just
gonna leave anyways.

636
00:30:18,083 --> 00:30:19,950
That's what you said
last week, girl.

637
00:30:20,017 --> 00:30:21,550
He's still here.

638
00:30:21,616 --> 00:30:23,983
You wait. He going.

639
00:30:24,050 --> 00:30:25,231
Badriyah: I hope not.

640
00:30:27,250 --> 00:30:28,207
What?

641
00:30:28,349 --> 00:30:30,046
I like mr. Clark.

642
00:30:30,050 --> 00:30:31,950
That's 'cause you
from a foreign country,

643
00:30:32,017 --> 00:30:34,050
and you don't know
how we do here.

644
00:30:34,117 --> 00:30:37,284
How... do we do?

645
00:30:37,349 --> 00:30:40,017
Do like us, baby.

646
00:30:40,083 --> 00:30:43,150

you gotta do like we do.

647
00:30:43,217 --> 00:30:45,150

What?

666
00:31:48,965 --> 00:31:50,556
Yeah, go to
your room, julio!

Hey, who's talking to you?

668

Was i talking to you?

You gonna hit me?

No.

671
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,007
But you did break
rule number 2.

672
00:32:00,073 --> 00:32:01,506
"You gonna hit me, sir?"

Hey, get off me, dawg!

00:32:06,040 --> 00:32:07,606
You think that's funny?

676
00:32:07,673 --> 00:32:09,940
Shameika, you're in charge.

677
00:32:10,007 --> 00:32:11,606

Look, i know
you have 2 strikes.

681
00:32:19,539 --> 00:32:21,740
You walk out now,
they'll expel you
for sure.

682
00:32:21,806 --> 00:32:23,473
Just get back in there.

683
00:32:23,539 --> 00:32:24,673
Why?

684
00:32:24,740 --> 00:32:27,806
Because i would
miss your glowing
personality.

685
00:32:29,439 --> 00:32:30,294
Mr. Turner
doesn't have to know
anything about this.

686
00:32:30,344 --> 00:32:30,850
Just...

687
00:32:31,744 --> 00:32:33,274
give yourself
another chance.

It is well done.

696
00:32:58,425 --> 00:32:59,659
What are you talking
about? It's rare.

697
00:32:59,925 --> 00:33:01,425
Fine, i'll burn it.

698
00:33:01,492 --> 00:33:02,692
Just take out the rest
of the order.

699

Nope.

with the students?

isn't the kids.

It's not even what
they can achieve.

919

what you expect
them to achieve.

to go rock climbing.

But there i was,
on the edge
of this cliff,

and my friends
are yelling,

"jump, jump, jump!"

00:44:24,116 --> 00:44:25,127

942
00:44:26,514 --> 00:44:29,330
and it is
a long way down.

943
00:44:30,251 --> 00:44:31,710

and i'm yelling,

"yes, you can.
You can do it!

I thought i was
going to die,

949
00:44:42,761 --> 00:44:44,175

950
00:44:45,260 --> 00:44:47,754
it felt like
i was flying.

that i never thought
i could do.

pretty cool.

may not know this,

up and up and up.

time to jump.

to do it.

to come up here,

light a candle...

that we are
joined together.

00:51:26,987 --> 00:51:29,113
Tomorrow's saturday.
I could meet you
at the coffee shop

1074
00:51:29,387 --> 00:51:30,899
by the school.
I'll buy you lunch.

1075
00:51:38,865 --> 00:51:39,968
Ll be there at noon.

1076
00:51:41,098 --> 00:51:41,872
Noon.

1077
00:51:49,797 --> 00:51:50,907
Can i take that now?

1078
00:51:50,957 --> 00:51:51,997
Yeah, thank you.

1079
00:51:52,224 --> 00:51:53,052
Too bad he didn't
show up.

1080
00:52:08,390 --> 00:52:09,920
Here i am,
not even 2:00.

1081
00:52:10,057 --> 00:52:13,185
I'm early, sir.
Down for study session
<i>numero tres.</i>

1083
00:52:27,937 --> 00:52:29,618
Then we get another

1084
00:52:29,718 --> 00:52:31,329
Ok, so that's
5 cards up.

1085
00:52:31,453 --> 00:52:31,930
Yeah.

1086
00:52:31,980 --> 00:52:32,984
Can you add
those up for me?

1087
00:52:33,212 --> 00:52:34,580
You know,
we gotta bet first.

1088
00:52:34,846 --> 00:52:37,127
I bet 5
fake dollars.

1089
00:52:38,965 --> 00:52:44,434
Lli'alanth 3
that's good.

1090
00:52:45,012 --> 00:52:46,248
Now what's the
square root of that?

1091
00:52:47,313 --> 00:52:49,037
Uh... oh, square root.

1092
00:52:49,079 --> 00:52:50,625
Ok, i think the square
root is... [snores]

1093
00:52:51,179 --> 00:52:54,969
What number, multiplied
by itself, gives you 36?

1094
00:52:55,746 --> 00:52:58,712
Uh... 6?

1095
00:52:59,158 --> 00:53:00,006
That's good.

1096
00:53:00,425 --> 00:53:01,052
Heh heh.

1097
00:53:01,792 --> 00:53:02,132
So, what you got?

1098
00:53:02,891 --> 00:53:03,897
Pair of 7's.

1099
00:53:04,342 --> 00:53:05,640
Well, i guess i get
all the chips.

1100
00:53:05,941 --> 00:53:07,296
Because i got three 10's.

1101
00:53:07,674 --> 00:53:08,657
Oh, pay up, dog!

1102
00:53:09,041 --> 00:53:10,045
Wanna go again?

1103
00:53:16,871 --> 00:53:18,021
Shameika wallace?

1104
00:53:18,594 --> 00:53:20,336
Didn't we have
an appointment
after school today?

1105
00:53:21,012 --> 00:53:21,933
Musta slipped my mind.

1106
00:53:22,512 --> 00:53:25,136
We have to talk about you
turning in your homework.

1107
00:53:25,744 --> 00:53:27,426
I told you...
the fire alarm

1108
00:53:27,476 --> 00:53:28,464
keeps going off
in my building.

1109
00:53:29,076 --> 00:53:30,318
3 times this week?

1110
00:53:30,876 --> 00:53:32,957
I get busy, forget.

1111
00:53:38,744 --> 00:53:40,516
Last night i just
didn't do a good
enough job.

1112
00:53:41,644 --> 00:53:43,734
Would you like
to show me your homework?

1113
00:53:43,784 --> 00:53:44,983
I'm sure i can
help you with it.

1114
00:53:56,281 --> 00:53:57,962
This is really... close.

1115
00:53:58,814 --> 00:53:59,482
We can fix this.

1116
00:53:59,582 --> 00:54:00,070
Yeah?

1117
00:54:01,749 --> 00:54:02,627
For reals?

1118
00:54:02,749 --> 00:54:04,237
Sure, we can work
on it right now.

1119
00:54:04,682 --> 00:54:06,005
There's a few
spelling mistakes,

1120
00:54:06,055 --> 00:54:07,181
[knocking]

1121
00:54:06,607 --> 00:54:08,682
And just
arrange some of the
paragraphs different...

1122
00:54:08,732 --> 00:54:09,578
yeah.

1123
00:54:13,232 --> 00:54:15,165
[Yelling]

1124
00:54:15,232 --> 00:54:17,898
There you go.

1125
00:54:17,965 --> 00:54:20,265
He's been cranky
and fussy all day.

1126
00:54:20,332 --> 00:54:21,510
I think maybe
he's got a fever.

1127
00:54:22,965 --> 00:54:24,883
Ok. Thank you,
mrs. Benton.

1128
00:54:27,365 --> 00:54:29,195
Mr. Clark, i can't work
on my paper right now.

1129
00:54:29,215 --> 00:54:30,482
I goa go make dinner.

1130
00:54:31,224 --> 00:54:32,008
I'll do it.

1131
00:54:32,657 --> 00:54:33,360
You'll do what?

1132
00:54:33,936 --> 00:54:35,868
I'll make dinner,
and you work
on your paper.

1133
00:54:36,996 --> 00:54:38,265
All right?
Ok.

1134
00:54:38,315 --> 00:54:39,476
Start with that
third paragraph.

1135
00:54:40,148 --> 00:54:40,836
Hi.

1136
00:54:42,248 --> 00:54:43,953
Ok, where's the food?

1137
00:54:48,481 --> 00:54:49,808
Ron: Dinner's served.

1138
00:54:50,547 --> 00:54:51,872
I'm tryin' to concentrate.

1139
00:54:52,081 --> 00:54:53,550
Concentrate later.
Dinner's served.

1140
00:54:55,781 --> 00:54:58,446
I tried like you said.
I moved the third paragraph,

1141
00:54:58,496 --> 00:54:59,486
and it sounds really good.

1142
00:54:59,696 --> 00:55:00,862
Good.

1143
00:55:00,929 --> 00:55:02,799
Ok. Now, that's for you.

1144
00:55:03,396 --> 00:55:04,503
And who gets
the baby food?

1145
00:55:04,862 --> 00:55:05,613
He does.

1146
00:55:05,829 --> 00:55:07,350
Ok, you're gonna
like this.

1147
00:55:07,563 --> 00:55:08,550
This looks really good.

1148
00:55:09,463 --> 00:55:10,726
* ooh oooh *

1149
00:55:12,062 --> 00:55:13,896
[door slams]

1150
00:55:13,962 --> 00:55:15,141
What's he doing here?

1151
00:55:16,850 --> 00:55:17,826
He made us dinner.

1152
00:55:20,135 --> 00:55:22,158
You don't think i can
take care of my family,
mr. Clark?

1153
00:55:23,316 --> 00:55:25,029
No. Yes.

1154
00:55:28,983 --> 00:55:31,564
Please, leave my house.

1155
00:55:41,650 --> 00:55:42,817
[Door closes]

1156
00:55:47,750 --> 00:55:50,385
I come home to find him
in my kitchen cooking
for my family.

1157
00:55:50,516 --> 00:55:51,874
This girl has a job to do.

1158
00:55:51,983 --> 00:55:53,516
Ms. Wallace,
can we please not
talk about shameika

1159
00:55:53,583 --> 00:55:54,666
like she's not
in the room?

1160
00:55:54,716 --> 00:55:56,233
I'll talk any way i want.

1161
00:55:56,716 --> 00:55:58,716
Now, i send my daughter
to school to be educated.

1162
00:55:58,783 --> 00:56:00,976
I don't expect a teacher to
bring school up in my house.

1163
00:56:01,284 --> 00:56:02,676
It's called homework.

1164
00:56:03,383 --> 00:56:03,924
Excuse me?

1165
00:56:03,974 --> 00:56:05,512
She has too much of it

1166
00:56:05,562 --> 00:56:06,608
to be babysitting
all the time.

1167
00:56:06,929 --> 00:56:07,723
Mr. Clark.

1168
00:56:07,773 --> 00:56:08,979
Shameika
has more potential

1169
00:56:09,029 --> 00:56:10,304
than any kid
in my class.

1170
00:56:10,737 --> 00:56:11,917
Why can't you see that?

1171
00:56:12,503 --> 00:56:13,565
How dare you!

1172
00:56:14,159 --> 00:56:15,489
How you going to tell me
what i should

1173
00:56:15,539 --> 00:56:16,515
and should not see
in my daughter?

1174
00:56:18,583 --> 00:56:21,450
I am merely suggesting
that you give her
a chance.

1175
00:56:24,082 --> 00:56:25,011
I'm taking
my child home now.

1176
00:56:25,782 --> 00:56:26,726
The white tornado here

1177
00:56:26,776 --> 00:56:27,997
better not be teaching
at this school

1178
00:56:28,147 --> 00:56:28,890
when i bring her
back tomorrow.

1179
00:56:29,547 --> 00:56:31,835
Ms. Wallace, i can
assure you i will deal
with the situation.

1180
00:56:32,547 --> 00:56:33,925
Come on, shameika.

1181
00:56:35,247 --> 00:56:37,005
Please don't fire,
mr. Clark!

1182
00:56:39,655 --> 00:56:40,950
He was just trying
to help me, mama.

1183
00:56:41,655 --> 00:56:43,062
He's just
trying to help.

1184
00:56:43,755 --> 00:56:44,867
That's... that's ok.

1185
00:56:45,889 --> 00:56:48,153
Please don't leave
because of me, mr. Clark.

1186
00:57:05,334 --> 00:57:06,334
Ms. Wallace,
wait.

1187
00:57:07,101 --> 00:57:07,983
I'll meet you outside.

1188
00:57:09,234 --> 00:57:09,824
Why are you doing this?

1189
00:57:10,401 --> 00:57:11,864
You gave her
these grand ideas,

1190
00:57:11,914 --> 00:57:12,992
and this world is just
going to crush her down.

1191
00:57:13,513 --> 00:57:14,850
I don't believe that.

1192
00:57:16,281 --> 00:57:17,281
So, you're just going
to drop into her life,

1193
00:57:17,348 --> 00:57:18,123
and now you you know
all about it, right?

1194
00:57:18,614 --> 00:57:19,744
I just know
she's a great student,

1195
00:57:20,964 --> 00:57:22,731
a born leader...
creative, intelligent.

1196
00:57:24,297 --> 00:57:24,930
Shameika?

1197
00:57:25,348 --> 00:57:26,217
My shameika?

1198
00:57:25,617 --> 00:57:26,260
Yes.

1199
00:57:27,499 --> 00:57:28,883
If she tests
well enough in may,

1200
00:57:29,066 --> 00:57:31,309
i think we might
be able to get her
into manhattan west

1201
00:57:31,632 --> 00:57:32,642
for middle school.

1202
00:57:33,599 --> 00:57:34,870
That's for gifted kids.

1203
00:57:42,565 --> 00:57:44,978
Maybe mrs. Benton
can keep the boys

1204
00:57:45,028 --> 00:57:46,216
a little longer every day.

1205
00:57:48,166 --> 00:57:48,795
Ok.

1206
00:57:50,816 --> 00:57:51,353
Ok.

1207
00:57:54,549 --> 00:57:55,437
Ok.

1208
00:58:07,549 --> 00:58:08,050
Good morning, mr. Clark.

1209
00:58:08,100 --> 00:58:08,650
Good morning.

1210
00:58:09,100 --> 00:58:10,443
Morning, mr. Clark.

1211
00:58:14,633 --> 00:58:16,252
Julio, did you do this?

1212
00:58:17,733 --> 00:58:18,717
You like it, mr. Clark?

1213
00:58:19,334 --> 00:58:20,924
It's really good.

1214
00:58:20,974 --> 00:58:22,230
You got quite
a talent for this.

1215
00:58:22,874 --> 00:58:24,951
Well, it's one
of my manys, dawg...

1216
00:58:26,641 --> 00:58:27,373
sir.

1217
00:58:28,140 --> 00:58:28,771
Thanks.

1218
00:58:29,720 --> 00:58:30,304
Good morning.

1219
00:58:47,029 --> 00:58:47,574
Yo, what up, tay?

1220
00:58:51,962 --> 00:58:53,569
[Taunting]
Do you like me,
mr. Clark?

1221
00:58:53,962 --> 00:58:55,768
Hey, don't hate on me
'cause i got skills.

1222
00:58:55,818 --> 00:58:58,118
Skills?! You mean being
a straight up punk?

1223
00:58:58,168 --> 00:58:59,235
You real good at that!

1224
00:59:00,369 --> 00:59:02,111
Yo, come on, tay,
just chill out.

1225
00:59:02,469 --> 00:59:03,677
You telling me
to chill, homey?!

1226
00:59:03,835 --> 00:59:04,877
You telling me
to chill?!

1227
00:59:05,168 --> 00:59:07,920
Come on, man, i mean,
mr. Clark likes
that art crap, ok?

1228
00:59:08,434 --> 00:59:10,208
So, he thought i did it,
and i just went with it.

1229
00:59:15,768 --> 00:59:17,301
I'm sorry, man!

1230
00:59:18,568 --> 00:59:19,835
Aah!

1231
00:59:27,102 --> 00:59:29,369
Superintendent stevens
has joined us

1232
00:59:29,419 --> 00:59:31,724
to determine if tayshawn
mitchell should be expelled

1233
00:59:31,774 --> 00:59:33,132
from inner harlem
elementary.

1234
00:59:33,182 --> 00:59:35,906
I vote yes.
Send him to juvi.

1235
00:59:37,127 --> 00:59:39,081
This isn't
a democracy,
mr. Brampton.

1236
00:59:39,093 --> 00:59:42,028
Howard, would you let
mr. Turner finish
what he was saying?

1237
00:59:42,253 --> 00:59:43,288
You're his
foster parent.

1238
00:59:43,946 --> 00:59:45,316
You got the say here.

1239
00:59:46,813 --> 00:59:48,987
We don't need
his lazy ass around
the house all day.

1240
00:59:49,380 --> 00:59:50,270
What did you
just say?

1241
00:59:52,013 --> 00:59:52,858
Mr. Turner:
Ahem.

1242
00:59:57,046 --> 00:59:58,340
Look,
if we expel him,

1243
00:59:58,390 --> 01:00:00,107
he's only going to
fall further behind.

1244
01:00:00,157 --> 01:00:02,108
Mr. Clark, our students
can't simply

1245
01:00:02,158 --> 01:00:04,112
do what they want
with no consequences.

1246
01:00:04,557 --> 01:00:06,210
What about
the consequences
for tayshawn?

1247
01:00:06,260 --> 01:00:08,599
We are supposed
to be keeping these kids
<i>in</i> school.

1248
01:00:11,004 --> 01:00:13,533
Mr. Turner: Let's all
just take a step back.

1249
01:00:13,770 --> 01:00:17,597
Remember that i have eyes
in the back of my head,

1250
01:00:17,647 --> 01:00:18,775
so, stop fighting.

1251
01:00:22,281 --> 01:00:25,014
This is not a test.

1252
01:00:25,081 --> 01:00:26,777
This is my phone number.

1253
01:00:27,637 --> 01:00:28,900
I want you guys to call me

1254
01:00:28,950 --> 01:00:30,858
if you have any questions
about homework,

1255
01:00:31,330 --> 01:00:33,770
need any advice, or you are
in trouble.

1256
01:00:34,364 --> 01:00:36,394
That's 24/7.

1257
01:00:39,364 --> 01:00:41,523
Pick up your math workbooks
at the front of the class.

1258
01:00:42,863 --> 01:00:45,802
And we have a book report
due tomorrow.

[Bell rings]

1260
01:00:51,230 --> 01:00:53,195
Remember, there are
2 variables in this equation.

1261
01:00:53,464 --> 01:00:54,780
Ok? So "x" equals...

1262
01:00:55,430 --> 01:00:57,297
"x" equals...

1263
01:00:57,364 --> 01:00:58,821
come on, tayshawn,
you can do this.

1264
01:00:59,330 --> 01:01:00,870
Yo, not with you
all up on me, man!

1265
01:01:02,163 --> 01:01:03,605
Yeah.

1266
01:01:08,863 --> 01:01:09,565
"X" equals 3/8!

1267
01:01:09,665 --> 01:01:12,782
Yes! Ah, that's great.
Just keep doing it
like that.

1268
01:01:44,598 --> 01:01:45,520
This doesn't sound good.

1269
01:01:46,240 --> 01:01:47,422
How long you been this way?

1270
01:01:48,073 --> 01:01:49,935
A week. Maybe more.

1271
01:01:50,507 --> 01:01:51,339
Well, you have pneumonia.

1272
01:01:51,756 --> 01:01:52,764
I can send you home,

1273
01:01:52,814 --> 01:01:54,269
but you'd be confined
to bed rest for 2 weeks...

1274
01:01:54,369 --> 01:01:55,852
minimal.

1275
01:01:55,902 --> 01:01:57,535
Yeah, i can't do that.

1276
01:01:58,502 --> 01:02:01,969
Or i can admit you
to the hospital right now,
mr. Clark.

1277
01:02:09,435 --> 01:02:11,802
[Beeping]

1278

[School bell rings]

1279
01:02:26,036 --> 01:02:28,648
[Voice strained]
Ok, everybody,
take your seats.

1280
01:02:29,702 --> 01:02:32,545
Mr. Clark, you look
really white.

1281
01:02:32,869 --> 01:02:34,404
Yeah, even more than usual.

1282
01:02:35,702 --> 01:02:37,631
We have 4...

1283
01:02:39,202 --> 01:02:40,548
4 weeks.

1284
01:02:42,036 --> 01:02:44,259
Now, i know that doesn't
seem like a lot of time,

1285
01:02:44,309 --> 01:02:45,401
but if we work
really hard,

1286
01:02:45,776 --> 01:02:48,249
i know we're going to do
great on these exams.

1287
01:02:49,443 --> 01:02:55,025
So, let's go over
our science topics
from last week.

1288
01:02:55,075 --> 01:02:55,770
Who knows those?

1289
01:03:00,309 --> 01:03:03,658
Magnetism, chemical reactions,
and gravity.

1290
01:03:04,542 --> 01:03:05,826
Ok, good. Gravity.

1291
01:03:06,792 --> 01:03:07,313
Gravity...

1292
01:03:08,741 --> 01:03:10,688
is important because...

1293
01:03:16,175 --> 01:03:17,959
ok, we get it, mr. Clark.

1294
01:03:18,542 --> 01:03:20,255
Gravity makes you
fall down.

1295
01:03:25,075 --> 01:03:26,008
Girl:
Is he kidding?

1296
01:03:26,075 --> 01:03:27,841
Always joking.

1297
01:03:27,908 --> 01:03:29,458
He not kidding!
Mr. Clark?

1298
01:03:30,065 --> 01:03:30,689
Mr. Clark?

1299
01:03:31,731 --> 01:03:33,898
[Commotion]

1300
01:03:44,898 --> 01:03:46,258
I hope he's all right.

1301
01:04:22,178 --> 01:04:23,178
For you.

1302
01:04:25,099 --> 01:04:25,687
Hey, mariss...

1303
01:04:27,542 --> 01:04:28,548
thank you.

1304
01:04:31,576 --> 01:04:33,042
Wait. Come over here.

1305
01:04:37,110 --> 01:04:40,498
Can't have our mr. Clark
looking all sloppy now,
can we?

1306
01:04:43,076 --> 01:04:45,135
You know, a guy
could get used to this.

1307
01:04:48,277 --> 01:04:49,145
Come on,
teach already.

1308
01:04:51,243 --> 01:04:53,943
Ok, now just because
i'm on this video tape,

1309
01:04:54,010 --> 01:04:55,284
doesn't mean
that i can't see see you.

1310
01:04:55,709 --> 01:04:57,676
Alita, is that gum?

1311
01:05:02,676 --> 01:05:03,817
All right,
is everybody ready?

1312
01:05:04,843 --> 01:05:05,677
All: Yes, sir.

1313
01:05:06,676 --> 01:05:07,253
Gravity...

1314
01:05:08,343 --> 01:05:10,296
the force of attraction
between 2 objects.

1315
01:05:14,421 --> 01:05:16,038
That is gravity.

1316
01:05:17,054 --> 01:05:19,534
Now, according to the
definition of gravity,
why did the egg fall?

1317
01:05:19,584 --> 01:05:21,332
Because...
and no, julio,

1318
01:05:21,382 --> 01:05:23,794
it's not because the egg
and the floor are hot
for each other.

1319
01:05:24,249 --> 01:05:25,549
[Laughter]

1320
01:05:25,247 --> 01:05:26,686
Turn around and face me.

1321
01:05:27,979 --> 01:05:30,355
The egg fell because
the force of the mass

1322
01:05:30,405 --> 01:05:32,948
and the distance between
the egg and the floor

1323
01:05:33,039 --> 01:05:34,523
caused a reaction.

1324
01:05:35,405 --> 01:05:39,209
And, now, get out your
workbooks, because i have
to clean my floor.

1325
01:05:53,438 --> 01:05:54,278
Morning, mr. Clark!

1326
01:05:54,328 --> 01:05:56,363
Good morning, tisha.
Got my kids' homework?

1327
01:06:00,055 --> 01:06:00,990
Good to have you back.

1328
01:06:03,871 --> 01:06:05,144
That's not true.

1329
01:06:05,194 --> 01:06:06,899
Yes, it is.
I want my cd back

1330
01:06:06,949 --> 01:06:08,226
and my money, bitch.

1331
01:06:08,276 --> 01:06:09,971
Stupid, i gave
that cd back!

1332
01:06:10,021 --> 01:06:10,721
No, you didn't!

1333
01:06:11,704 --> 01:06:12,691
Yes, i did!
You always...

1334
01:06:12,904 --> 01:06:14,383
it's mr. Clark!

1335
01:06:43,971 --> 01:06:45,225
Yo, what up, mr. C?

1336
01:06:49,424 --> 01:06:50,214
You tell me.

1337
01:06:54,558 --> 01:06:57,122
You guys have one week
till the state exams.

1338
01:06:58,219 --> 01:07:00,112
One week
to show mr. Turner...

1339
01:07:01,645 --> 01:07:02,383
and your parents...

1340
01:07:03,112 --> 01:07:04,358
and yourselves
what you can do.

1341
01:07:08,435 --> 01:07:10,361
And you guys don't
have anything you
want to tell me?

1342
01:07:14,868 --> 01:07:16,810
There's no way we're
gonna pass those tests.

1343
01:07:16,960 --> 01:07:18,446
We always mess up.

1344
01:07:18,426 --> 01:07:20,902
Don't jump on us,
man... sir.

1345
01:07:21,793 --> 01:07:23,147
I mean, it's
nothing personal.

1346
01:07:23,197 --> 01:07:25,648
Everything we do
in this room
is personal,

1347
01:07:27,226 --> 01:07:28,456
how we talk
to each other,

1348
01:07:29,426 --> 01:07:30,301
how we work together,

1349
01:07:30,351 --> 01:07:32,596
and how we've
prepared for these tests.

1350
01:07:33,564 --> 01:07:35,002
But we're
way behind now.

1351
01:07:36,030 --> 01:07:37,748
We're not behind.
You're ahead!

1352
01:07:39,390 --> 01:07:41,568
Everyone thinks
we're losers,
mr. Clark.

1353
01:07:42,530 --> 01:07:43,363
No.

1354
01:07:46,231 --> 01:07:47,980
You are not losers.

1355
01:07:55,830 --> 01:07:56,830
These rules?

1356
01:07:58,481 --> 01:08:01,151
They represent
everything you've
accomplished this year.

1357
01:08:02,151 --> 01:08:03,638
Discovering new things,

1358
01:08:05,123 --> 01:08:06,368
believing in each other,

1359
01:08:06,397 --> 01:08:07,754
believing in yourselves.

1360
01:08:11,263 --> 01:08:12,124
And i'm proud of you.

1361
01:08:14,963 --> 01:08:17,522
Compared to all that,
this test? Pfh.

1362
01:08:18,763 --> 01:08:19,313
It's nothing.

1363
01:08:20,696 --> 01:08:21,396
Mr. Clark,

1364
01:08:21,896 --> 01:08:24,742
we have to get
certain grades
to graduate, right?

1365
01:08:26,096 --> 01:08:28,392
So what if we,
you know, choke?

1366
01:08:28,442 --> 01:08:29,657
But you're not
going to choke.

1367
01:08:32,308 --> 01:08:34,058
You guys didn't work
hard all this year

1368
01:08:34,108 --> 01:08:35,514
just to get ready
for some tests.

1369
01:08:38,524 --> 01:08:41,010
Every day,
in this room...

1370
01:08:42,953 --> 01:08:45,324
we are learning things
far more valuable

1371
01:08:45,374 --> 01:08:47,023
than you can get
in some book.

1372
01:08:50,778 --> 01:08:51,662
I teach you...

1373
01:08:54,778 --> 01:08:55,651
and you teach me...

1374
01:08:58,444 --> 01:09:01,563
and, together, we
learn to love to learn.

1375
01:09:04,077 --> 01:09:07,378
[Exhales]

1376
01:09:06,802 --> 01:09:07,375
So...

1377
01:09:09,535 --> 01:09:10,082
next week...

1378
01:09:11,169 --> 01:09:12,331
you're gonna
take that test,

1379
01:09:12,802 --> 01:09:14,747
you're gonna do
the best that you can do,

1380
01:09:15,902 --> 01:09:17,435
and you are going
walk out of that room

1381
01:09:17,936 --> 01:09:19,902
and know that you can
do anything you want

1382
01:09:19,919 --> 01:09:20,747
for the rest of your lives.

1383
01:09:33,218 --> 01:09:34,415
All right,
tomorrow is the big day,

1384
01:09:34,465 --> 01:09:36,451
but don't worry.
You know the material

1385
01:09:36,501 --> 01:09:38,131
backwards and forwards.

1386
01:09:38,181 --> 01:09:39,463
So, just get
a good night's sleep

1387
01:09:40,181 --> 01:09:41,555
and, you know, good luck.

1388
01:09:42,648 --> 01:09:44,233
Badriyah, can i talk
to you for one minute?

1389
01:09:44,283 --> 01:09:46,634
And, tayshawn,
can you wait for me
at the door, please?

1390
01:09:50,883 --> 01:09:53,528
I know that it's
been hard for you
to fit in.

1391
01:09:54,916 --> 01:09:57,225
But, you can be smart
and still be cool.

1392
01:09:58,400 --> 01:09:59,983
In fact, you're
so smart and cool,

1393
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:01,898
you can do anything
you want to do.

1394
01:10:03,807 --> 01:10:04,765
I want to be
a doctor.

1395
01:10:06,141 --> 01:10:07,083
Ok, good.

1396
01:10:07,941 --> 01:10:10,424
You better kick
some butt on that test,
then, doctor.

1397
01:10:13,308 --> 01:10:14,240
Thank you, mr. Clark.

1398
01:10:14,424 --> 01:10:15,191
Good luck!

1399
01:10:16,992 --> 01:10:17,458
Tayshawn!

1400
01:10:23,292 --> 01:10:24,874
Yo, kid, get it done.

1401
01:10:24,925 --> 01:10:27,691
Know what i'm sayin'?
Do this.

1402
01:10:27,758 --> 01:10:28,529
Hey, what up, t?

1403
01:10:28,579 --> 01:10:29,901
Yeah, little brother,
where you been, man?

1404
01:10:29,951 --> 01:10:30,549
We been looking for you.

1405
01:10:31,085 --> 01:10:31,934
You forgot
what's up?

1406
01:10:32,651 --> 01:10:33,666
Hey, check it,
we got some goods

1407
01:10:33,716 --> 01:10:34,342
we gotta move now.
Come on.

1408
01:10:35,083 --> 01:10:35,835
It's raining, dude,
come on.

1409
01:10:41,317 --> 01:10:41,554
Hey!

1410
01:10:42,716 --> 01:10:45,058
Look, you can't
be in and not roll.

1411
01:10:45,850 --> 01:10:46,907
A'ight, you can't
be like that, son.

1412
01:10:47,850 --> 01:10:48,800
I was thinking maybe

1413
01:10:48,850 --> 01:10:50,010
we could walk
to school together.

1414
01:10:51,384 --> 01:10:52,576
We can do
a last-minute review

1415
01:10:52,626 --> 01:10:53,494
of the test on the way.

1416
01:10:55,726 --> 01:10:57,165
Yo, you want it this way

1417
01:10:57,215 --> 01:10:59,334
or that way, payaso?
Which way? Come on!

1418
01:11:03,921 --> 01:11:04,804
That way.

1419
