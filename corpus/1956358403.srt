Oh, yeah, that... That... That's Parmesan.

173

I've got, like, a bunch of Parmesan
in the glove compartment.

You kissed me with tongue.

192

You took off my underwear.
You took it to the next step.

193

Because I felt bad you'd have to tell
everyone at college that you're a virgin.

Well, I was planning to lie about that.

Uh, San Francisco, you're opening
a new restaurant in two months,

231
00:12:05,755 --> 00:12:07,939
and I need you there
by the end of this week, permanently.

232
00:12:07,963 --> 00:12:10,314
- That's beautiful, Sharice.
- I ordered you guys a great house.

Oh, sounds good.

234
00:12:11,255 --> 00:12:12,897
Your mom wants to pick you up
from the airport.

I told her I'd get you a car,

- Oh.

to have to tip somebody.

- Water?

That came from your thigh gap?
No, thank you.

You know she had that diaper on.

334
00:16:16,588 --> 00:16:19,671
...he'll be the best husband he can be.
So, in that sense,

335
00:16:20,046 --> 00:16:21,338
it's really for the both of us.

336
00:16:21,421 --> 00:16:23,272
Are you serious?
What the hell is happening right now?

337
00:16:23,296 --> 00:16:25,296
- He'll just be gone for half a year...
- Stop it.

338
00:16:25,380 --> 00:16:28,380
- And he flew out this morning to India.
- Like, the India? Like, the...

339
00:16:28,838 --> 00:16:30,213
- the country?
- India.

340
00:16:30,296 --> 00:16:33,505
So instead of getting married,
he's gonna, like, just Eat Pray Love?

341
00:16:33,588 --> 00:16:35,921
And in the meantime,
we're gonna see other people.

342
00:16:36,005 --> 00:16:37,130
Wait, what?

343
00:16:37,213 --> 00:16:39,088
We are gonna see other people.

344
00:16:39,171 --> 00:16:41,380
So we're both absolutely sure
that we belong together.

345
00:16:41,713 --> 00:16:43,880
Think of it like a six-month Bachelorette.

346
00:16:43,963 --> 00:16:46,630
You know? San Francisco
could not have come at a better time.

347
00:16:46,713 --> 00:16:48,588
I'll get away, reset.

348
00:16:48,838 --> 00:16:52,296
Go to the aquarium, marvel at that...
albino alligator.

349
00:16:52,380 --> 00:16:54,421
- It's all good!
- Mm-hmm.

350
00:16:54,505 --> 00:16:55,838
I'm gonna go do inventory.

351
00:17:01,421 --> 00:17:03,171
- [sniffles]
- [door closes]

352
00:17:10,838 --> 00:17:12,255

[exhales]

354
00:17:24,171 --> 00:17:25,921
- Oh, God. [chuckles]
- [door closes]

355
00:17:26,005 --> 00:17:29,088
I'm sorry.
I'm just, um, getting the oyster sauce.

356
00:17:30,255 --> 00:17:32,380
[quietly] Okay. Um...

357
00:17:33,755 --> 00:17:35,880
Never give anybody your heart, Enrique.

358
00:17:38,755 --> 00:17:39,755
Thank you, Chef.

359
00:17:40,296 --> 00:17:41,416
["Blow the Whistle" playing]

360
00:17:42,838 --> 00:17:44,088
[door closes]

361
00:17:44,630 --> 00:17:47,838
♪ Blow the whistle, blow the whistle ♪

[doorbell rings]

364
00:18:04,838 --> 00:18:06,213
Mr. Kim!

365
00:18:07,046 --> 00:18:08,046
Wait...

366
00:18:08,213 --> 00:18:09,963
- Veronica!
- Yes.

367
00:18:10,046 --> 00:18:11,630
- You're back in San Francisco?
- Hi.

368
00:18:11,838 --> 00:18:13,713
My God! How long's it been?

369
00:18:13,796 --> 00:18:16,880
Oh, gosh. I don't think I've seen you
since high school graduation.

370
00:18:17,338 --> 00:18:18,796
- [Mr. Kim laughs]
- Veronica?

371
00:18:19,171 --> 00:18:20,171
Marcus!

372
00:18:20,255 --> 00:18:21,588
[laughs] Hey!

373
00:18:21,671 --> 00:18:24,255
Oh, my goodness! Hi!

374
00:18:24,338 --> 00:18:25,522
- [Marcus] All right.
- Hi, hi, hi!

375
00:18:25,546 --> 00:18:27,838
- I'll bring the rest. Be right back.
- [both chuckle]

376
00:18:28,005 --> 00:18:29,671
- Wow, look at you!
- Yeah.

377
00:18:29,755 --> 00:18:30,755
It's so good to see you.

378
00:18:30,796 --> 00:18:33,546
- [Veronica] You, too.
- So you lost all your piercings, huh?

379
00:18:33,630 --> 00:18:35,171
Oh no, not all of 'em.

380
00:18:35,838 --> 00:18:38,088
[seagulls cry]

381
00:18:40,046 --> 00:18:43,713
[clears throat] Uh, well,
uh, thank you for hiring us for this job

382
00:18:43,796 --> 00:18:45,516
and, uh,
congrats on the house and the baby.

383
00:18:45,546 --> 00:18:47,564
- Oh, thanks. It's not my house, though.
- [Sasha] Hey, V!

384
00:18:47,588 --> 00:18:49,005
The bathroom counter is too high.

385
00:18:49,088 --> 00:18:50,463
I'm gonna need a stool to...

386
00:18:56,005 --> 00:18:59,046
Uh, hey, what's up? [laughs]

387
00:18:59,213 --> 00:19:01,005
Wow. Look who's here? It's...

388
00:19:01,505 --> 00:19:03,213
Look who's here, this... This is...

389
00:19:03,296 --> 00:19:05,338
And who's in the house. It's you!

390
00:19:05,421 --> 00:19:06,546
This is amazing.

391
00:19:06,796 --> 00:19:10,088
- Hi, Marcus.
- Hi! Yeah, hi, Sasha.

392
00:19:10,171 --> 00:19:13,005
Hi. Hello. Hi. [chuckles] What's up?

393
00:19:14,046 --> 00:19:15,505
- [clears throat]
- Long time.

394
00:19:15,880 --> 00:19:19,171
Yes. Yes.
Very long time, uh, very much so indeed.

395
00:19:19,255 --> 00:19:24,296
Uh... But, you know, time passes,
and now it's like current, modern...

396
00:19:24,838 --> 00:19:27,796
It's like we're here, and this is great.
It's... [chuckles]

397
00:19:28,796 --> 00:19:29,796
So I...

398
00:19:30,046 --> 00:19:32,046
I guess you're the air conditioning guy?

399
00:19:32,380 --> 00:19:34,755
Oh? Oh, this?
No, no, I just like the ease of a onesie.

400
00:19:34,838 --> 00:19:36,171
Oh, okay.

401
00:19:36,380 --> 00:19:38,630
You're back in town?
I thought you moved to LA.

402
00:19:38,713 --> 00:19:40,338
Uh, I... I did. Um...

403
00:19:40,421 --> 00:19:43,338
I'm just renting this house.
I'm here for two months.

404
00:19:43,588 --> 00:19:45,130
We're opening a restaurant.

405
00:19:45,296 --> 00:19:47,546
If you're renting,
then why are you installing AC...

406
00:19:47,630 --> 00:19:50,046
No way! Sasha Tran!

407
00:19:50,130 --> 00:19:52,505
Mr. Kim! Oh, my God.

408
00:19:52,588 --> 00:19:54,630
- Oh!
- [both laugh]

409
00:19:54,713 --> 00:19:55,713
Look at you!

410
00:19:55,796 --> 00:19:58,546
You have not changed one bit.
How do you not age?

411
00:19:58,963 --> 00:20:00,463
I wash my face with shampoo.

412
00:20:00,630 --> 00:20:02,213
[both laugh]

413
00:20:02,421 --> 00:20:05,630
I can't believe I'm seeing you.
We thought you'd never come back.

414
00:20:05,713 --> 00:20:07,630
- You're like our own Asian Oprah.
- Oh!

415
00:20:07,713 --> 00:20:09,421
How much money do you have now?

416
00:20:09,505 --> 00:20:10,671
[laughs]

417
00:20:10,963 --> 00:20:11,963
He's serious.

418
00:20:12,463 --> 00:20:15,380
- Oh... [chuckles]
- Oh! I just read you're getting married

419
00:20:15,838 --> 00:20:18,296
to that guy, your manager. Seems great!

420
00:20:18,380 --> 00:20:20,796
Older than I thought, but...

421
00:20:21,171 --> 00:20:22,171
good.

422
00:20:22,338 --> 00:20:25,296
- How old is he?
- He's a very young 50.

423
00:20:25,380 --> 00:20:27,171
Uh, he does a lot of Capoeira.

424
00:20:27,505 --> 00:20:31,463
He, uh, shops at, uh, um... Under Armour.

425
00:20:32,088 --> 00:20:33,588
And, uh, he has...

426
00:20:33,921 --> 00:20:36,171
uh, 57,000 followers on Instagram.

427
00:20:37,671 --> 00:20:39,838
Okay. Well, me and Marcus,

428
00:20:39,921 --> 00:20:42,505
we're gonna get you all set up.
Don't worry. Oh!

429
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:44,546
Invest your money in lettuce.

430
00:20:44,838 --> 00:20:46,463
Kale can't hold on forever.

431
00:20:48,921 --> 00:20:49,921
[Veronica] Hmm.

432
00:20:50,213 --> 00:20:52,630
Dude, you so did that on purpose.

433
00:20:52,713 --> 00:20:54,564
[Veronica] I thought
it was just gonna be Mr. Kim.

434
00:20:54,588 --> 00:20:57,046
I had no idea
Marcus was gonna be working with him.

435
00:20:57,130 --> 00:20:59,921
The company
is literally called "Harry and Son."

436
00:21:00,338 --> 00:21:02,588
Yeah, "sun," like in the sky.

437
00:21:03,046 --> 00:21:04,564
- It's what I thought.
- [Sasha] Whatever.

438
00:21:04,588 --> 00:21:05,713
Your plan didn't work.

439
00:21:05,796 --> 00:21:08,171
Well, I thought
this was your six-month Bachelorette.

440
00:21:08,255 --> 00:21:09,421
Yeah, with strangers.

441
00:21:09,796 --> 00:21:12,088
I'm not trying to Bachelorette
with Marcus Kim.

442
00:21:12,171 --> 00:21:13,630
There's way too much history there.

443
00:21:13,838 --> 00:21:17,171
- Plus, he's so not my type anymore.
- Oh, you mean because he's not an asshole?

444
00:21:17,255 --> 00:21:20,171
Oh, he's an asshole.
He's just a stealth asshole.

445
00:21:20,505 --> 00:21:23,171
Like those good-looking guys,
those white dudes with a beard

446
00:21:23,255 --> 00:21:25,272
that come up to you on the street,
all good-looking,

447
00:21:25,296 --> 00:21:27,005
ask you how you're doing,

448
00:21:27,130 --> 00:21:29,505
and then you realize
they're carrying a clipboard,

449
00:21:29,588 --> 00:21:33,546
asking to donate money
for some endangered flora and fauna.

450
00:21:33,921 --> 00:21:37,255
- Misleading you.
- All right, I'll take that as a maybe.

451
00:21:37,463 --> 00:21:40,088
Look, I gotta go.
Denise wants to talk nursery motif.

452
00:21:40,171 --> 00:21:42,713
And for some reason,
she's so anti-penguin.

453
00:21:42,921 --> 00:21:45,088
I mean, this one has a hat on it.

454
00:21:45,338 --> 00:21:47,546
It's so cute.
I didn't know penguins get cold.

455
00:21:47,630 --> 00:21:49,713
I think it's fiction when they wear hats.

456
00:21:49,796 --> 00:21:52,755
I always forget whether fiction's
the real one or the fake one.

457
00:21:53,921 --> 00:21:55,963
- Love you!
- I love you, too. [softly] Good night.

458
00:21:56,046 --> 00:21:57,046
[line clicks]

459
00:21:59,296 --> 00:22:00,421
[chuckles]

460
00:22:00,796 --> 00:22:01,921
Look at my pool.

461
00:22:02,921 --> 00:22:05,546
You know who doesn't have a pool? Marcus.

462
00:22:12,046 --> 00:22:14,546
No,
the LA restaurant is non-denominational,

463
00:22:14,630 --> 00:22:15,755
modern Vietnamese fusion.

464
00:22:16,130 --> 00:22:19,046
The San Francisco one
is gonna be a step up from that.

465
00:22:19,130 --> 00:22:21,713
It's trans-denominational.

466
00:22:22,588 --> 00:22:25,088
[chuckles] Yes! Yes!

467
00:22:25,338 --> 00:22:29,171
Transgressive, transforming, transcendent.
Ah! Brilliant!

468
00:22:29,255 --> 00:22:31,755
Excellent thoughts, as always.
Thank you, Julian.

469
00:22:31,838 --> 00:22:33,838
- [chuckles]
- [phone clicks]

470
00:22:34,130 --> 00:22:35,505
[sighs] Mm.

471
00:22:39,213 --> 00:22:41,005
Does it get tiring doing that?

472
00:22:41,213 --> 00:22:43,005
My work? No. I love it.

473
00:22:43,213 --> 00:22:44,838
No, your phone voice.

474
00:22:44,921 --> 00:22:45,921
My what?

475
00:22:46,671 --> 00:22:48,796
You know, that voice you use on the phone.

476
00:22:49,130 --> 00:22:52,296
[in exaggerated tone] "Brilliant!
Excellent, as always. Ta-ta, Julian!"

477
00:22:52,421 --> 00:22:53,505
[Sasha] Okay, first of all,

478
00:22:53,588 --> 00:22:54,880
you sound like Count Chocula.

479
00:22:55,088 --> 00:22:57,048
- [scoffs]
- [Sasha] And that's very rude, Marcus.

480
00:22:57,255 --> 00:22:59,921
Especially considering
I'm the customer paying you money.

481
00:23:00,213 --> 00:23:03,130
It's just funny
because I know it's not you, that voice.

482
00:23:03,380 --> 00:23:05,463
Well, you haven't known me
for a very long time.

483
00:23:05,546 --> 00:23:08,046
And PS, have you seen yourself
in those coveralls?

484
00:23:08,130 --> 00:23:09,530
You look like a homeless astronaut.

485
00:23:10,421 --> 00:23:12,546
Hey, guys, I'm off to the restaurant,

486
00:23:12,630 --> 00:23:15,088
but I picked you up
some breakfast burritos.

487
00:23:15,171 --> 00:23:18,296
- [Sasha] Mm!
- I've already had one. Well, two.

488
00:23:18,588 --> 00:23:21,005
- Who's counting?
- Excellent. [chuckles softly]

489
00:23:21,838 --> 00:23:23,238
[enthusiastically] Ta-ta, Veronica!

490
00:23:23,296 --> 00:23:24,689
Oh, don't use your phone voice
on me, bitch.

491
00:23:24,713 --> 00:23:26,713
[footsteps fading]

492
00:23:29,255 --> 00:23:31,463
- [Mr. Kim] So, you just set it...
- [thermostat beeps]

493
00:23:32,171 --> 00:23:34,713
...and forget it.
Like that commercial for that thing.

494
00:23:35,005 --> 00:23:36,713
- What thing?
- I can't remember.

495
00:23:36,796 --> 00:23:39,838
But if you have any problems,
like I said, call us.

496
00:23:40,380 --> 00:23:41,963
Thanks, Mr. Kim.

497
00:23:42,213 --> 00:23:43,755
[both chuckle softly]

498
00:23:44,588 --> 00:23:45,588
Uh...

499
00:23:45,921 --> 00:23:48,213
- Thank you, Marcus.
- You're welcome, Sasha.

500
00:23:50,088 --> 00:23:51,796
- Um...
- [Marcus clicks tongue]

501
00:23:52,880 --> 00:23:55,338
Oh, wait! Did you invite Sasha
to your gig tomorrow?

502
00:23:55,421 --> 00:23:56,296
- She'd love it.
- No.

503
00:23:56,380 --> 00:23:58,588
- Gig?
- [Mr. Kim] Hello Peril. His band.

504
00:23:58,671 --> 00:24:00,856
- You ought to go. They're so good!
- Let's not do this, Dad.

505
00:24:00,880 --> 00:24:02,546
Hello Peril's still together?

506
00:24:02,630 --> 00:24:04,755
- Sixteen years strong.
- Wow.

507
00:24:04,838 --> 00:24:06,647
- I'll get you a flyer for the show.
- No, do not get a...

508
00:24:06,671 --> 00:24:08,831
- They're in the van.
- [Marcus] Why are you getting...

509
00:24:09,796 --> 00:24:13,380
- The whole original band's still together?
- No, it's just me and Quasar.

510
00:24:13,463 --> 00:24:15,046
Um, but remember Tony Gill?

511
00:24:15,130 --> 00:24:16,630
- Oh, yeah.
- Yeah. He joined.

512
00:24:16,713 --> 00:24:18,838
The only one you don't know
is our drummer, Ginger.

513
00:24:18,921 --> 00:24:19,755
She's awesome.

514
00:24:19,838 --> 00:24:21,921
She grew up in the Bay Area.
She had three moms.

515
00:24:22,338 --> 00:24:25,255
Oh! Their tampon budget must have been
through the roof.

516
00:24:25,338 --> 00:24:27,630
Hey, look at that. [chuckles]

517
00:24:27,838 --> 00:24:30,463
Um... My... My schedule tomorrow's
a little tight, so...

518
00:24:30,546 --> 00:24:32,213
- Yeah.
- Well, if it changes.

519
00:24:34,380 --> 00:24:35,546
I have to say, uh...

520
00:24:35,963 --> 00:24:39,171
I'm surprised you two lost touch.
You used to be so close.

521
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:41,130
I always thought...

522
00:24:41,713 --> 00:24:43,796
maybe you'd end up together. [chuckles]

523
00:24:44,921 --> 00:24:46,338
[Marcus] Dad! Jesus!

524
00:24:48,588 --> 00:24:50,505
[sighs] Okay... Um...

525
00:24:51,005 --> 00:24:52,005
Yeah.

526
00:24:58,546 --> 00:25:00,880
[upbeat instrumental music playing]

527
00:25:22,755 --> 00:25:24,088
[sighs]

528
00:25:49,005 --> 00:25:52,088
[woman 1] So design-wise,
we're very much embracing your philosophy

529
00:25:52,171 --> 00:25:54,963
of highlighting the original architecture
of the space.

530
00:25:55,046 --> 00:25:59,421
Okay. So, right here, I'm thinking
big communal table with Gubi chairs.

531
00:25:59,505 --> 00:26:02,005
Over here, two-tops with Gubi chairs.

532
00:26:02,088 --> 00:26:04,713
Right over here, I'm thinking four-tops
with Gubi chairs,

533
00:26:04,796 --> 00:26:07,880
and in this little nook right here,
I'm thinking a six-top round with...

534
00:26:07,963 --> 00:26:09,796
Let me guess: Gubi chairs!

535
00:26:10,338 --> 00:26:11,796
I was thinking high-back...

536
00:26:12,255 --> 00:26:14,095
but, you know what? [chuckles]
You're the boss,

537
00:26:14,130 --> 00:26:16,380
so we can absolutely switch them
to Gubis.

538
00:26:16,463 --> 00:26:18,880
I don't even really know
what Gubi chairs look like.

539
00:26:19,213 --> 00:26:21,213
You know, they look a bit like chairs.

540
00:26:22,005 --> 00:26:24,296
Um... Meaning that they've got...

541
00:26:24,463 --> 00:26:27,921
They've got these, like... uh,
four kind of like...

542
00:26:28,796 --> 00:26:30,397
legs.
I don't know why I'm doing that gesture,

543
00:26:30,421 --> 00:26:31,505
and that's inappropriate.

544
00:26:31,588 --> 00:26:32,647
- I'm so sorry.
- [woman 2] Hello?

545
00:26:32,671 --> 00:26:33,796
- Um...
- [man] Sasha!

546
00:26:33,880 --> 00:26:34,713
[woman 2] Hello?

547
00:26:34,796 --> 00:26:36,588
- [tapping on glass]
- [man] Sasha!

548
00:26:37,213 --> 00:26:38,588
- Sasha!
- Sasha? Are you in there?

549
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,171
- Why are my parents here?
- Ooh, I don't know.

550
00:26:41,255 --> 00:26:44,005
- [Mr. Tran] Parking meter is expired!
- I kept saying "Gubi."

551
00:26:44,088 --> 00:26:44,963
Yeah, you did.

552
00:26:45,088 --> 00:26:47,755
- I was spiraling.
- You got a little sweat on your top lip.

553
00:26:47,838 --> 00:26:51,213
- She's gonna fire me, isn't she?
- No. She'd make me do it.

00:26:53,880 --> 00:26:55,380
Oh! Hey!

556
00:26:55,838 --> 00:26:58,296
- [lock clicks]
- [Sasha and Mr. Tran] Hi.

557
00:26:58,755 --> 00:27:01,421
- [chuckles]
- [Mrs. Tran] Hi! How are you?

558
00:27:01,963 --> 00:27:05,713
- Wow, this is so crazy you guys are here.
- Who picked you up from the airport?

559
00:27:05,796 --> 00:27:06,880
[Sasha] I got car service.

560
00:27:07,046 --> 00:27:08,130
Oh, no.

561
00:27:08,463 --> 00:27:09,671
Did you have to pay tip?

562
00:27:09,755 --> 00:27:12,671
No, Dad. I jumped out
when he slowed down at a stop sign.

563
00:27:12,838 --> 00:27:15,171
[chuckles]
So, what are you guys doing here?

564
00:27:15,255 --> 00:27:18,130
Veronica posted on Facebook
that you would be here.

565
00:27:18,463 --> 00:27:20,213
- [Sasha growls]
- Oh!

566
00:27:20,921 --> 00:27:23,671
Is someone... I think someone's calling me
about Gubi chairs.

567
00:27:23,838 --> 00:27:25,397
[Mrs. Tran] We're just happy you're home.

568
00:27:25,421 --> 00:27:27,897
[Mr. Tran] Now that we have sold
the store, we have so much free time.

569
00:27:27,921 --> 00:27:30,755
We are throwing
your cousin Barry's son, Liam,

570
00:27:30,838 --> 00:27:32,130
a birthday party next week.

571
00:27:32,713 --> 00:27:34,671
So, you get to see the new house.

572
00:27:34,755 --> 00:27:37,463
I didn't think I would like retirement,
but it's good.

573
00:27:37,546 --> 00:27:39,713
Yesterday, I hung a bird feeder in a tree.

574
00:27:39,796 --> 00:27:42,255
That's great, Dad, but you know,
guys, um...

575
00:27:42,338 --> 00:27:44,338
I'm gonna be really busy
opening the restaurant.

576
00:27:44,713 --> 00:27:48,880
I have two months to finalize the layout,
design the menu, choose the suppliers.

577
00:27:49,171 --> 00:27:51,505
Then I fly to New York
and have to do it all over again.

578
00:27:51,588 --> 00:27:52,755
[Mr. Tran] What day?

579
00:27:52,838 --> 00:27:54,713
I know someone in New York
who can pick you up.

580
00:27:54,796 --> 00:27:55,996

Nine.

to do with our band.

605
00:29:22,130 --> 00:29:24,588
since when has our band made any sense?

606
00:29:25,171 --> 00:29:26,171
Okay.

00:29:26,380 --> 00:29:28,880

maybe we'll have a better chance of...

608

612
00:29:38,130 --> 00:29:39,439
Marcus, did you have a chance
to call Southie's

613
00:29:39,463 --> 00:29:41,171
and ask about us playing Thursday nights?

614
00:29:41,255 --> 00:29:42,963
Oh, yeah... um, no.

615
00:29:43,130 --> 00:29:44,380
I don't like Southie's.

616
00:29:44,463 --> 00:29:46,088
Okay, okay, fair,

617
00:29:46,171 --> 00:29:48,838
except they're, like, three times
the size of this place.

618
00:29:48,921 --> 00:29:50,522
Yeah,
but they're on the other side of town.

619
00:29:50,546 --> 00:29:53,466
- People don't know us over there.
- Yeah, because we've never been there!

620
00:29:53,796 --> 00:29:56,338
Marcus, this is just like
when you refused to try cold brew

621
00:29:56,421 --> 00:29:57,713
because you'd never heard of it.

622
00:29:57,796 --> 00:30:00,588
And then it took a year
of me convincing you to try it,

623
00:30:00,671 --> 00:30:02,380
and then what happened? Huh?

624
00:30:02,755 --> 00:30:05,213
- What do you love now?
- Cold brew.

625
00:30:05,296 --> 00:30:06,713
Cold brew.

I think I'm just gonna do,
like, a zoo theme.

00:32:32,171 --> 00:32:33,796
Thanks, girl. Feeling good.

Oh, um...

739
00:35:20,421 --> 00:35:22,838
The community youth group
that I work with...

740
00:35:23,005 --> 00:35:25,338
um, was performing performance art

741
00:35:25,421 --> 00:35:30,088
about the illegal trafficking
of tropical birds, and...

742
00:35:30,755 --> 00:35:34,421
Hello Peril was on the same bill,
and I saw him perform,

743
00:35:34,505 --> 00:35:35,963
and I just fell in love.

744
00:35:36,921 --> 00:35:40,005
Wow, babe,
that was almost five months ago.

745
00:35:40,088 --> 00:35:42,421
- Can you believe it?
- Five months? Wow. Yeah.

746
00:35:42,505 --> 00:35:44,963
I was a polyam
before Marcus and I got married.

747
00:35:45,296 --> 00:35:47,880
Wait... you two are married?

748
00:35:48,171 --> 00:35:49,588
No, no, no. No, we're not.

749
00:35:49,671 --> 00:35:53,796
Not in your traditional,
heteronormative sense. [laughs]

750
00:35:54,005 --> 00:35:55,380
We're married spiritually

751
00:35:55,671 --> 00:35:56,796
and sexually.

752
00:35:56,921 --> 00:35:58,588
Yeah, but not literally. [chuckles]

753
00:35:59,588 --> 00:36:01,963
Uh, anyway, Jenny is, um, amazing.

754
00:36:02,130 --> 00:36:04,880
She, uh, works with underserved kids
in the community,

755
00:36:04,963 --> 00:36:08,421
teaching them drama and music,
and, uh, she's taught me a lot

756
00:36:08,505 --> 00:36:11,171
about being more conscious
of the world around me, you know.

757
00:36:11,505 --> 00:36:13,338
That's great. [chuckles]

758
00:36:13,421 --> 00:36:16,630

760
00:36:18,921 --> 00:36:21,046

[Sasha]
You don't have to give me a ride home.

767
00:36:39,505 --> 00:36:40,713
I can call an Uber.

768
00:36:41,005 --> 00:36:43,685
I'd be happy to charge you for the ride
if it makes you feel better.

769
00:36:43,755 --> 00:36:46,338
- Uh, you know it wouldn't.
- [both laugh]

770
00:36:49,546 --> 00:36:51,713
So, uh... Jenny's...

771
00:36:52,338 --> 00:36:53,421
quite the character.

772
00:36:53,713 --> 00:36:57,088
Yeah, she's, um... very free, you know?

773
00:36:57,171 --> 00:37:00,296
How does an Asian person
even cultivate dreadlocks on their head?

774
00:37:00,380 --> 00:37:02,421
I don't know,
but a crocheting tool is involved.

775
00:37:02,505 --> 00:37:04,796
Oh. Does the carpet match the drapes?

776
00:37:04,880 --> 00:37:07,171
[chuckles softly]
No, it's just a huge bush.

777
00:37:07,255 --> 00:37:09,380

- I kind of love it, though, you know?

- Nothing.
- Why were you looking in my back seat?

790
00:37:51,338 --> 00:37:55,671
I wasn't. I was just, uh...
My chiropractor says I gotta, you know...

- turn, rotate my...
- Look at the back seat?

792
00:37:57,421 --> 00:37:59,255
- Yeah.
- Because we had sex back there?

793
00:37:59,338 --> 00:38:01,522
- [laughs] Oh, my God!
- That's why you're looking back there.

795
00:38:03,838 --> 00:38:06,296
So what do you think?
Seeing it after all these years?

796
00:38:06,380 --> 00:38:08,921
That it might be even smaller
and grosser than I remember.

797
00:38:09,005 --> 00:38:11,046
You better still be talking
about my back seat.

798
00:38:11,130 --> 00:38:12,380
[laughs]

799
00:38:12,546 --> 00:38:15,005

it would have been nice, you know,

00:38:15,088 --> 00:38:18,588

with a coworker?

00:38:27,713 --> 00:38:30,838
- I was 18. I had no money.
- Well, you could have saved it.

806
00:38:30,921 --> 00:38:31,796
You could have stolen it.

807
00:38:31,880 --> 00:38:34,356
You stole nuts out of the nut bins
every day at Rainbow Grocery.

808

That's called "tasting."

00:39:46,338 --> 00:39:48,796
Hey, the flatware rep is here.

835
00:39:48,880 --> 00:39:50,505
I know, it's a lot.

836
00:39:51,005 --> 00:39:52,171
And Netflix just called.

837
00:39:52,255 --> 00:39:55,175
They wanna know if you can cater
a wrap party this Sunday at the Fairmont.

838
00:39:55,505 --> 00:39:57,505
- Is it for The Crown?
- [Veronica] No.

839
00:39:57,588 --> 00:40:00,921
It's for that new Kevin James show
where he plays a young Benjamin Franklin.

840
00:40:02,421 --> 00:40:05,796
Um... Okay, screw it. Yeah, sure.

841
00:40:05,880 --> 00:40:08,713
- Why not? [chuckles]
- All right! [exclaims]

843
00:40:22,755 --> 00:40:24,380
Is that Padma Lakshmi?

844
00:40:25,671 --> 00:40:28,380
He's Bacheloretting with Padma?

845
00:40:28,630 --> 00:40:32,005
Stupid, beautiful, talented Padma Lakshmi.

846
00:40:36,338 --> 00:40:37,380
[alert chimes]

847
00:40:40,380 --> 00:40:41,755
[chuckles softly]

848
00:40:46,588 --> 00:40:49,046
[Tony] I mean, what did we do
before the Internet?

849
00:40:49,130 --> 00:40:52,130
Okay, so I'm gonna go ahead and fill out
the application for the audition...

850
00:40:52,713 --> 00:40:53,713
[typing]

851
00:40:57,046 --> 00:40:59,130
[Tony] They wanna know
if any of us have been married

852
00:40:59,213 --> 00:41:00,880
for the application for the auditions.

853
00:41:00,963 --> 00:41:03,338
That's so weird... Hello, Marcus?

854
00:41:03,421 --> 00:41:05,505
Are you listening to me
or are you messaging someone?

855
00:41:06,130 --> 00:41:09,171
- Oh, um... No, I'm listening. What's up?
- I called Southie's.

856
00:41:09,255 --> 00:41:11,796
They said Thursdays are open,
but we've gotta audition.

857
00:41:11,880 --> 00:41:13,588
[sighs] Against 100 other bands.

858
00:41:13,671 --> 00:41:15,338
I mean, yeah, at least. It's Southie's.

859
00:41:15,421 --> 00:41:18,046
- Isn't that great?
- I have a question for you.

860
00:41:18,421 --> 00:41:19,255
Shoot.

861
00:41:19,338 --> 00:41:21,171
Why did you bail on dinner
the other night?

862
00:41:21,671 --> 00:41:22,546
What dinner?

863
00:41:22,630 --> 00:41:23,671
[Marcus] After the show.

864
00:41:23,755 --> 00:41:26,130
Remember? We were all gonna go to dinner,
and then...

865
00:41:26,213 --> 00:41:28,255
Jenny showed up, and then you bailed.

866
00:41:28,630 --> 00:41:31,838
Oh... Yeah, that's... Uh...

867
00:41:32,171 --> 00:41:34,505
- You... You know, uh, I had...
- [Marcus] Uh...

868
00:41:34,588 --> 00:41:36,005
- What?
- I know what?

869
00:41:36,088 --> 00:41:37,606
- You were gonna say something?
- You...

870
00:41:37,630 --> 00:41:40,522
- I'm asking you, why did you bail?
- Right, and then you said something after.

871
00:41:40,546 --> 00:41:42,106
- [Marcus] I didn't.
- You were gonna tell me why I bailed.

872
00:41:42,130 --> 00:41:44,963
- [Marcus] No. No, I'm asking you why.
- Right. Um...

873
00:41:45,338 --> 00:41:46,978
You forgot what your lie was, didn't you?

874
00:41:47,130 --> 00:41:48,255
- I did.
- [Marcus] Yeah.

875
00:41:48,338 --> 00:41:50,296
[sighs] Whatever. Um...

876
00:41:50,421 --> 00:41:52,921
Are we done with this meeting?
Because I wanna smoke weed now,

877
00:41:53,005 --> 00:41:54,713
but I don't wanna disrespect the process.

878
00:41:55,088 --> 00:41:56,463
Whoa! Me, too. Light her up.

879
00:41:59,588 --> 00:42:01,296
- Suppress the darkness.
- Yep.

Barry.

886
00:42:28,296 --> 00:42:29,838
Hey! So glad you came.

887
00:42:29,921 --> 00:42:31,814
- [Sasha] Oh.
- Always fun seeing my famous cousin.

888
00:42:31,838 --> 00:42:34,546
- No! Thanks for inviting me.
- [both chuckle]

889
00:42:35,838 --> 00:42:37,505
[Sasha] Can you believe all this?

890
00:42:37,588 --> 00:42:40,046
You know what my parents gave me
for my eighth birthday?

891
00:42:40,130 --> 00:42:40,963
Flip-flops.

892
00:42:41,046 --> 00:42:44,213
[chuckles] Well, they've been
amazing godparents to Liam.

893
00:42:44,630 --> 00:42:45,921
They're really close.

894
00:42:46,630 --> 00:42:47,671
Nice for Liam. [scoffs]

895
00:42:47,755 --> 00:42:49,475
But sometimes they do go
a little overboard.

896
00:42:49,505 --> 00:42:51,588
Like getting a Diana Ross impersonator.

897
00:42:55,130 --> 00:42:58,421
What's a Diana Ross impersonator doing
at an eight-year-old's birthday party?

898
00:42:58,838 --> 00:43:01,213
Your dad said she was much cheaper
than Beyoncé.

899
00:43:05,880 --> 00:43:07,560
So, when are you gonna find out
the gender?

900
00:43:07,630 --> 00:43:13,088
I'm doing a non-gender-binary situation,
so just give me gray baby clothes.

901
00:43:13,255 --> 00:43:14,713
- [Marcus] Hey.
- Hey!

902
00:43:14,796 --> 00:43:16,046
- Yeah.
- [Sasha] You made it.

903
00:43:16,130 --> 00:43:17,564
- Thanks for the invite.
- [Sasha] Yeah.

904
00:43:17,588 --> 00:43:18,588
Yeah.

905
00:43:21,505 --> 00:43:22,921
- What's up, V?
- You know.

906
00:43:23,005 --> 00:43:25,838
- [chuckles] I do.
- Yeah.

907
00:43:27,171 --> 00:43:28,921
I think your dad's already here.

908
00:43:29,005 --> 00:43:31,005
[kids playing]

909
00:43:31,088 --> 00:43:33,338
- Lemonade?
- Oh... thanks.

910
00:43:33,546 --> 00:43:35,796
I'm Harry. Uh, huge Diana Ross fan.

911
00:43:36,546 --> 00:43:38,380
Kathy. Huge lemonade fan.

[both laugh]

913
00:43:40,046 --> 00:43:43,380
I, uh... didn't know what to get him,
so I just went with Legos.

914
00:43:43,463 --> 00:43:45,630
Oh, what did you bring, Sasha?

915
00:43:45,921 --> 00:43:47,380
Kids love chocolate, all right?

916
00:43:47,463 --> 00:43:50,088
Matcha green tea dark chocolate
with French gray sea salt?

917
00:43:50,171 --> 00:43:52,255
Yes. Kids know that shit is delicious.

918

[cell phone vibrating]

919
00:43:58,005 --> 00:43:59,338
Sorry, I'll be right back.

920
00:43:59,588 --> 00:44:00,630
That's cool.

921
00:44:01,505 --> 00:44:02,588
What kind of Legos?

922
00:44:03,171 --> 00:44:04,171
Red.

- Hey!
- [Brandon] Hey.

925
00:44:08,338 --> 00:44:09,880
I know we said we wouldn't talk.

926
00:44:09,963 --> 00:44:11,796
No, it's okay. [chuckles]

927
00:44:12,380 --> 00:44:15,005
It's just that yesterday...
something hit me.

928
00:44:16,046 --> 00:44:18,171
I finally realized...

929
00:44:19,046 --> 00:44:22,796
that we need to think bigger
in terms of your global branding.

930
00:44:22,880 --> 00:44:25,671
Padma was making me breakfast
this morning, and she agrees.

931
00:44:25,755 --> 00:44:28,755
- Mm-hmm.
- Your food can be transcontinental...

932
00:44:28,838 --> 00:44:31,088
- Brandon!
- Trans-denominational...

933
00:44:31,255 --> 00:44:32,130
- Trans...
- Brandon!

934
00:44:32,213 --> 00:44:34,671
- What?
- I don't give a shit, okay?

935
00:44:34,755 --> 00:44:36,921
I don't give a shit
about your branding thoughts.

936
00:44:37,463 --> 00:44:39,671
You never loved me.
This was just about business.

937
00:44:39,755 --> 00:44:42,546
I cannot believe I wasted
my prime reproductive years on you.

938
00:44:43,255 --> 00:44:44,880
I hope you have terrible karma

939
00:44:44,963 --> 00:44:48,005
and come back in the next life
as a nasty little lizard

940
00:44:48,088 --> 00:44:50,671
and get stepped on by someone on a hike!

941
00:44:51,546 --> 00:44:54,005
You are getting the finger
so hard right now.

942
00:44:54,296 --> 00:44:55,671
I hope you get malaria

943
00:44:55,921 --> 00:44:59,088
and shit yourself to death,
you shitty piece of shit!

944
00:45:03,630 --> 00:45:04,880
[goat bleats]

945
00:45:05,130 --> 00:45:06,713
A little softer, please.

946
00:45:07,338 --> 00:45:08,963
You are scaring the goats.

947
00:45:09,755 --> 00:45:10,755
Oh...

948
00:45:11,630 --> 00:45:13,088
[Sasha] We are so done.

949
00:45:13,921 --> 00:45:17,130
It was like being in love with a statue.
A sexy, handsome, chiseled statue

950
00:45:17,213 --> 00:45:19,088
of a Korean Eric from The Little Mermaid.

951
00:45:19,171 --> 00:45:20,588
He was just too perfect, you know?

952
00:45:20,671 --> 00:45:23,005
Like, I never felt
like I could be myself around him.

953
00:45:23,088 --> 00:45:24,671
Like, if I had to fart, I'd have to go

954
00:45:24,755 --> 00:45:26,671
to a completely different room
of the house.

955
00:45:26,755 --> 00:45:28,380
And he was so self-centered.

956
00:45:28,463 --> 00:45:31,171
He kept on saying how much he loved
and supported my career,

957
00:45:31,255 --> 00:45:33,880
when really it was just all
about how it made him look.

958
00:45:34,213 --> 00:45:37,046
All these men keep saying how much
they want a strong woman.

959
00:45:37,130 --> 00:45:39,088
What they really want is a cheerleader.

960
00:45:39,588 --> 00:45:42,713
So, yeah. I'm gonna die all alone
in a big house all by myself

961
00:45:42,796 --> 00:45:46,296
in complete, utter, and deafening silence.
I can feel it, Marcus.

962
00:45:48,213 --> 00:45:49,213
There, there.

963
00:45:51,838 --> 00:45:53,796
"There, there?" That... That's all you got?

964
00:45:53,880 --> 00:45:55,800
Well, I had more
at the beginning of your speech,

965
00:45:55,838 --> 00:45:57,213
and then I forgot it by the end.

966
00:45:57,296 --> 00:45:59,338
- [chuckling]
- [Marcus] Sorry. It was just so long.

967
00:46:00,171 --> 00:46:01,921
Oh, hey. Thank you.

968
00:46:05,255 --> 00:46:07,135
I can't believe this place
is still in business.

969
00:46:07,213 --> 00:46:09,613
What are we even doing here?
The food was always so terrible.

970
00:46:10,546 --> 00:46:12,505
- Are you insane?
- No.

971
00:46:12,588 --> 00:46:15,630
I eat here twice a week.
Here. Just try this, okay?

972
00:46:24,255 --> 00:46:26,421
- Hmm?
- [Sasha] Oh.

973
00:46:26,671 --> 00:46:29,671
- Yeah?
- Why do I remember this place as so bad?

974
00:46:29,755 --> 00:46:31,856
Because that's how you remember
your entire childhood.

975
00:46:31,880 --> 00:46:34,440
You painted the whole thing
with a shit brush, but it's not true.

976
00:46:35,713 --> 00:46:36,713
You're right.

977
00:46:37,380 --> 00:46:38,740
- This is good.
- [Marcus chuckles]

978
00:46:40,130 --> 00:46:42,546
This place hasn't changed one bit, either.
[chuckles]

979
00:46:43,005 --> 00:46:44,165
Those women are still so rude

980
00:46:44,213 --> 00:46:46,338
and disappointed
that neither of us speak Cantonese.

981
00:46:46,838 --> 00:46:50,130
Hmm. Hello! [speaking Cantonese]

982
00:46:50,213 --> 00:46:52,088
- [women speaking Cantonese]
- Hi, Marcus!

983
00:46:52,171 --> 00:46:54,171
- [woman 1] Hello!
- [woman 2] Marcus!

984
00:46:55,046 --> 00:46:56,380
I learned. Better service.

985
00:46:57,338 --> 00:46:59,546
Oh, also sometimes free shumai.

986
00:46:59,755 --> 00:47:01,630
- [speaking Cantonese]
- Oh!

987
00:47:05,338 --> 00:47:06,421
[Marcus chuckles]

988
00:47:09,296 --> 00:47:10,296
Mm.

989
00:47:10,588 --> 00:47:11,880
Mm. Nope, nope.

990
00:47:13,255 --> 00:47:14,255
[laughs sarcastically]

991
00:47:18,671 --> 00:47:19,671
Wow.

992
00:47:19,796 --> 00:47:22,713
Every single car has a handicap pass.

993
00:47:22,796 --> 00:47:24,880
Chinese people are hella gangster.

994
00:47:24,963 --> 00:47:26,296
- [chuckles]
- Look at that!

995
00:47:27,046 --> 00:47:29,130
Coming out of their cars all able-bodied.

996
00:47:29,713 --> 00:47:30,713
[alarm beeps]

997
00:47:31,421 --> 00:47:34,296
Hey! Hey, you guys are famous.

998
00:47:34,421 --> 00:47:35,796
Oh, yeah! Yeah!

999
00:47:35,880 --> 00:47:37,713
We're, uh, crushing it
in this neighborhood.

1000
00:47:37,796 --> 00:47:38,880
Or, like, this block.

1001
00:47:38,963 --> 00:47:41,296
Like, this half of this block,
we're big time.

1002
00:47:41,380 --> 00:47:43,880
You make fun of it,
but your band could really be something.

1003
00:47:44,255 --> 00:47:46,755
- Eh.
- What do you mean, "eh"?

1004

You used to talk about going
on a world tour.

1005
00:47:48,546 --> 00:47:51,630
[Marcus] No, I can't.
My dad needs me here. I'm his caregiver.

1006
00:47:51,796 --> 00:47:52,963
[Sasha] His caregiver?

1007
00:47:53,046 --> 00:47:55,046
Harry seems like he can give care
to himself.

1008
00:47:55,130 --> 00:47:57,171
Yeah, but he's getting older every day,
so...

1009
00:47:57,255 --> 00:47:59,838
But don't you want more?
Even just creatively?

1010
00:47:59,921 --> 00:48:02,314
Well, creatively I am writing a new song
called "Tennis Ball,"

1011
00:48:02,338 --> 00:48:03,856
and I think it's really gonna connect.

1012
00:48:03,880 --> 00:48:07,171
So you never wanna step outside
of this community, like, ever?

1013
00:48:07,338 --> 00:48:08,213
No.

1014
00:48:08,338 --> 00:48:09,588
Like, ever, ever?

1015
00:48:09,671 --> 00:48:12,505
Sasha, I don't.
Okay? San Francisco's my home.

1016

[Marcus] So, what are you gonna do
about Brandon?

1021
00:48:22,546 --> 00:48:24,481
[Sasha]
I guess I have to start dating again. Ugh.

1022
00:48:24,505 --> 00:48:25,921
Is there anything worse?

1023
00:48:26,005 --> 00:48:27,856
[Marcus] I don't know.
There are all those apps now.

1024
00:48:27,880 --> 00:48:31,796
I saw one where a guy can't even message
a girl until he sends her a gift card.

1025
00:48:31,880 --> 00:48:33,796
[laughs] Well...

1026
00:48:34,671 --> 00:48:36,838
Actually, if you want to know the truth,

1027
00:48:36,921 --> 00:48:39,630
I was thinking I'd give dating
the old college try.

1028
00:48:40,921 --> 00:48:42,755
But if it doesn't work out, um...

1029
00:48:43,630 --> 00:48:45,588
maybe I'll just have a baby on my own.

1030
00:48:46,213 --> 00:48:48,653
Really? You think you're at a place
to have a kid on your own?

1031
00:48:48,713 --> 00:48:50,421
Why not? So it would only have one parent?

1032
00:48:50,505 --> 00:48:53,005
So what? Not everyone has two parents.
I had no parents.

1033
00:48:53,088 --> 00:48:54,505
Sasha, you had parents.

1034
00:48:54,588 --> 00:48:55,588
I had me.

1035
00:48:57,255 --> 00:48:59,505
All right. Don't get mad.
Do whatever you want.

1036

I don't need your go-ahead, Marcus,
but thank you.

A pleasure to meet you, Marcus.

1167
00:55:42,838 --> 00:55:46,338
[chuckles]
Likewise, Keanu. I... I love your outfit.

1168
00:55:46,963 --> 00:55:48,671
- Oh, thanks, man.
- [Marcus] Yeah.

1169
00:55:48,880 --> 00:55:51,255
- Tom Ford made it custom for me.
- [Jenny] Wow.

1170
00:55:51,921 --> 00:55:54,380
- I... I didn't know you wore glasses.
- [Keanu] Oh, I don't.

1171
00:55:54,463 --> 00:55:55,921
My eyes are perfect.

1172
00:55:56,380 --> 00:56:00,005
This is for a part.
They don't even have lenses in them.

1173
00:56:00,505 --> 00:56:01,505
- See?
- [Jenny] Wow.

1174
00:56:01,588 --> 00:56:02,421
Nope.

1175
00:56:02,505 --> 00:56:04,588
[all laugh]

1176
00:56:04,671 --> 00:56:06,671
I love the suit. Classic.

1177
00:56:06,755 --> 00:56:09,421
Thank you, thank you.
It's my, uh, old tux from prom.

1178
00:56:09,505 --> 00:56:10,505
[Keanu] That's great.

1179
00:56:10,755 --> 00:56:13,046
I dropped out of high school,
went to work.

1180
00:56:13,963 --> 00:56:15,088
Followed my dream.

1181
00:56:18,213 --> 00:56:19,213
Shall we?

1182
00:56:19,421 --> 00:56:21,421
[Jenny giggles]

1183
00:56:23,296 --> 00:56:25,088
- You are stunning.
- Oh, my God.

1184
00:56:25,546 --> 00:56:27,088
- You look good.
- What?

1185
00:56:27,963 --> 00:56:28,963
You look good.

1186
00:56:30,755 --> 00:56:31,755
[Keanu] Let's feast.

1187
00:56:33,463 --> 00:56:35,588
- Hey, Charles.
- Good to see you again, Mr. Reeves.

1188
00:56:35,671 --> 00:56:36,505
You, too.

1189
00:56:36,671 --> 00:56:37,671
Hey...

1190
00:56:38,213 --> 00:56:39,213
may I ask...

1191
00:56:39,546 --> 00:56:42,671
do you have any dishes
that play with time?

1192
00:56:42,963 --> 00:56:44,880
The concept of time.

1193
00:56:45,005 --> 00:56:46,005
[Charles] Ah!

1194
00:56:46,421 --> 00:56:47,296
Yes,

1195
00:56:47,380 --> 00:56:49,921
we have a meat course
of venison sous vide.

1196
00:56:50,005 --> 00:56:51,647
It comes with headphones
so you can hear the sound

1197
00:56:51,671 --> 00:56:53,838
of the exact animal
you are about to consume,

1198
00:56:53,921 --> 00:56:56,171
illustrating nature's life to death cycle.

1199
00:56:57,713 --> 00:56:58,880
[laughs excitedly]

1200
00:56:58,963 --> 00:57:02,255
And of course, everything you see
on the table tonight is edible.

1201
00:57:02,338 --> 00:57:04,755
Yas! [giggles]

1202
00:57:05,880 --> 00:57:07,231
- Wait, so is this...
- [Charles] No.

1203
00:57:07,255 --> 00:57:08,255
Not the napkin, sir.

1204
00:57:08,421 --> 00:57:09,921
Don't eat the napkin, Marcus.

1205
00:57:12,588 --> 00:57:14,428
[Charles] Microgreens
and lettuces encapsulated

1206
00:57:14,505 --> 00:57:17,255
and served with dehydrated seaweed
and dried fish flakes.

1207
00:57:18,005 --> 00:57:19,213
Sorry, fish food?

1208
00:57:19,296 --> 00:57:20,713
- Fish flakes.
- [Marcus] Right.

1209
00:57:20,796 --> 00:57:22,046
Which is fish food.

1210
00:57:22,296 --> 00:57:24,588
We lightly scale the body
of the fish as it swims

1211
00:57:24,671 --> 00:57:26,796
collecting the particles it sheds
into the ocean.

1212
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:27,713
[Marcus] Oh, got it.

1213
00:57:27,796 --> 00:57:29,046
So it's fish dandruff.

1214
00:57:29,130 --> 00:57:31,588
[laughs loudly]

1215
00:57:33,213 --> 00:57:34,755
[Charles] Clear asparagus soup

1216
00:57:35,046 --> 00:57:37,296
- extracted with a centrifuge.
- [slurps]

1217
00:57:37,380 --> 00:57:39,088
[Charles]
The all-black monochrome course.

1218
00:57:40,171 --> 00:57:41,713
The flavor of Caesar salad.

1219
00:57:41,796 --> 00:57:43,213
[Keanu and Sasha] Mm!

1220
00:57:43,671 --> 00:57:46,130
- [Sasha] Mm! Mm!
- [Keanu moans]

1221
00:57:46,213 --> 00:57:47,880
[utensils clattering]

1222
00:57:52,213 --> 00:57:54,213
- [fork scrapes]
- [chewing loudly]

1223
00:57:59,755 --> 00:58:01,171
[sighs]

1224
00:58:04,296 --> 00:58:06,880
- [deer bleating over headphones]
- [chewing loudly]

1225
00:58:11,088 --> 00:58:12,380

1226

[swallows]

1227
00:58:19,088 --> 00:58:20,630
I'm sorry.

1228
00:58:25,838 --> 00:58:28,088
And to finish,
crystallized lavender sugar bubbles,

1229
00:58:28,171 --> 00:58:29,463
prepared by Wallace.

1230
00:58:29,796 --> 00:58:31,356
- [hair dryer whirring]
- Wait. How come...

1231
00:58:31,380 --> 00:58:32,713
Wow! Mm!

1232
00:58:33,671 --> 00:58:34,796
- Ah!
- Ooh, wow!

1233
00:58:34,880 --> 00:58:36,380
[Jenny] It tastes like a cloud.

1234
00:58:36,463 --> 00:58:38,505
- So, Henry...
- It's Marcus.

1235
00:58:38,588 --> 00:58:39,755
[Keanu] So, Marcus...

1236
00:58:40,296 --> 00:58:41,338
I hear you're in a band.

1237
00:58:41,546 --> 00:58:42,921
Oh! They are so awesome.

1238
00:58:43,046 --> 00:58:44,963
They could be really huge
if they wanted to be.

1239
00:58:45,046 --> 00:58:47,171
Have I heard of you guys
on the festival circuit?

1240
00:58:47,255 --> 00:58:49,046
Uh, no, we're just the block band.

1241
00:58:49,130 --> 00:58:50,130
See...

1242
00:58:50,296 --> 00:58:51,505
that right there...

1243
00:58:51,588 --> 00:58:52,963
is what it's all about.

1244
00:58:53,630 --> 00:58:55,796
Laboring in obscurity.

1245
00:58:56,088 --> 00:58:57,630
Starving and struggling.

1246
00:58:58,130 --> 00:59:01,338
The man who embraces
his mediocre nothingness...

1247
00:59:01,921 --> 00:59:03,255
shines greater...

1248
00:59:04,546 --> 00:59:05,546
than any.

1249
00:59:07,630 --> 00:59:08,671
Thank you, Keanu.

1250
00:59:09,171 --> 00:59:10,755
- Uh, to Marcus.
- To Marcus.

1251
00:59:10,838 --> 00:59:13,921
[Jenny] To Marcus, via Keanu's wise words.

1252
00:59:14,963 --> 00:59:18,463
Will you excuse me?
After a meal, I like to stretch my legs.

1253
00:59:18,880 --> 00:59:20,796
- Visit with your friends.
- [Sasha] Okay.

1254
00:59:20,880 --> 00:59:23,130
- I'm going to get some air.
- I love air.

1255
00:59:23,921 --> 00:59:25,838
- Let's get some air.
- [Jenny giggles]

1256
00:59:28,921 --> 00:59:29,921
Hey. Hey, don't be weird

1257
00:59:30,005 --> 00:59:32,296
about that nothingness thing, huh?
It was a compliment.

1258
00:59:32,463 --> 00:59:34,796
- That's just how he phrases things.
- Mm-hmm.

1259
00:59:35,380 --> 00:59:38,880
So, what do you think about him otherwise?
[chuckles]

1260
00:59:38,963 --> 00:59:41,671
Well, you know,
I think he could dial down the theatrics

1261
00:59:41,755 --> 00:59:43,421
by, like, 10,000.

1262
00:59:44,255 --> 00:59:45,255
Well, he's an actor.

1263
00:59:45,296 --> 00:59:46,338
He's a douche.

1264
00:59:46,421 --> 00:59:48,588
- Marcus.
- What? You asked me what I thought.

1265
00:59:48,671 --> 00:59:49,921
Yeah, well, I really like him.

1266
00:59:50,005 --> 00:59:51,296
- [sighs]
- He's really good...

1267
00:59:51,380 --> 00:59:53,838
Shall we continue our evening elsewhere?

1268
00:59:53,921 --> 00:59:56,546
Take the party back to my hotel
for a nightcap?

1269
00:59:56,630 --> 00:59:58,630
Yes, that would be so much fun.

1270
00:59:58,713 --> 01:00:01,380
- [Marcus] Um, what about the bill?
- I took care of it.

1271
01:00:01,921 --> 01:00:04,338
Saying I had to get some air
was just a charade.

1272
01:00:05,088 --> 01:00:08,463
Oh, um, you didn't even give me a chance
to fight you for it.

1273
01:00:08,546 --> 01:00:10,005
It's $6,400.

1274
01:00:10,630 --> 01:00:13,588
Less than a residual paycheck
from my hit movie Speed...

1275
01:00:14,213 --> 01:00:16,755
but... a little out of your ballpark.

1276
01:00:19,088 --> 01:00:20,255
But it's okay.

1277
01:00:21,171 --> 01:00:22,171
Thank you.

1278
01:00:23,255 --> 01:00:25,505
- I'm going to get the chariot.
- [Sasha] Okay.

1279
01:00:25,588 --> 01:00:26,713
I'll get our bags.

1280
01:00:29,671 --> 01:00:30,880
Look, okay... I...

1281
01:00:30,963 --> 01:00:33,171
I can see
how you would misconstrue that...

1282
01:00:34,255 --> 01:00:35,546
cupping of the face thing,

1283
01:00:35,630 --> 01:00:38,255
but I know him,
and it was an honest show of affection.

1284
01:00:38,338 --> 01:00:41,255
Yeah, he's great.
Everything about him, great.

1285
01:00:42,421 --> 01:00:45,046
- What's that supposed to mean?
- It means what it means.

1286
01:00:45,130 --> 01:00:47,439
[scoffs] If you're implying
something negative about Keanu,

1287
01:00:47,463 --> 01:00:48,796
have you taken a look at Jenny?

1288
01:00:48,880 --> 01:00:50,880
Jenny's a good person.
Jenny helps children.

1289
01:00:50,963 --> 01:00:53,796
Keanu helps children, too, probably.
He's helped a lot of people.

1290
01:00:53,880 --> 01:00:55,647
He was the greatest North American
box office draw

1291
01:00:55,671 --> 01:00:56,880
of the '90s and early 2000s.

1292
01:00:56,963 --> 01:00:58,283
- Then I'm wrong.
- You are wrong.

1293
01:00:58,338 --> 01:01:00,018
You're wrong
about a lot of things in life.

1294
01:01:00,046 --> 01:01:01,588
Well, I'm not wrong about the fact

1295
01:01:01,671 --> 01:01:04,463
that I'm hungry as hell
after a $6,400 dinner.

1296
01:01:04,546 --> 01:01:08,005
Hey! Can I get a monochrome burrito to go?

1297
01:01:10,838 --> 01:01:13,630
Just kidding. Kidding. [chuckles]
Very full.

1298
01:01:14,130 --> 01:01:17,505
Glad I wore my Spanx. [chuckles] See?

It was supposed to make you like me.

01:10:34,338 --> 01:10:37,671
Oh. Oh, really? How much practice?

1502
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:41,005
Hey. Don't slut shame me. [laughs]

1503
01:10:43,796 --> 01:10:44,921
[sighs]

1504
01:10:48,671 --> 01:10:49,713
I missed you.

1505
01:10:52,005 --> 01:10:53,005
Me, too.

1506
01:11:01,213 --> 01:11:03,130
I punched Keanu Reeves...

1507
01:11:03,838 --> 01:11:04,963
In the face.

1508
01:11:05,046 --> 01:11:06,463
[both laugh]

1509
01:11:06,546 --> 01:11:09,671
Also, can we talk about the fact
that he called us an Uber Pool?

1510
01:11:09,755 --> 01:11:10,856
- I think that was a mistake.
- No.

1511
01:11:10,880 --> 01:11:13,046
He definitely got us
the worst option on purpose.

1512
01:11:13,130 --> 01:11:15,130
[both chuckle softly]

Wow, she actually said that to you?

1544
01:12:57,130 --> 01:12:59,630
I can't believe it.
She always seemed so sweet in her movies.

1545
01:12:59,713 --> 01:13:02,296
Just because somebody
plays a singing teapot in a Disney movie

1546
01:13:02,380 --> 01:13:04,713
doesn't mean they're always nice, Marcus.
[chuckles]

1547
01:13:07,421 --> 01:13:09,171
It's nice to see you like this again.

1548
01:13:09,463 --> 01:13:10,463
Like what?

1549
01:13:10,505 --> 01:13:12,213
- Yourself.
- [Sasha] Well...

1550
01:13:13,046 --> 01:13:14,526
thanks for reminding me how it feels.

1551
01:13:15,255 --> 01:13:16,338
How what feels?

1552
01:13:17,088 --> 01:13:18,421
Home. [chuckles softly]

1553
01:13:20,630 --> 01:13:22,150
[Marcus] I love that you're back home.

01:13:27,588 --> 01:13:30,463
[Marcus]
Veronica, Denise, she's so beautiful.

1555
01:13:30,546 --> 01:13:32,838
- [both] Thank you.
- Isn't she amazing?

1556
01:13:32,921 --> 01:13:34,671
[gasps] I can't stop staring at her.

1557
01:13:34,755 --> 01:13:36,130
I mean, no pressure,

1558
01:13:36,213 --> 01:13:38,171
but I feel like
I'm a total natural godmother,

1559
01:13:38,255 --> 01:13:39,588
like the way I'm cradling her.

1560
01:13:39,671 --> 01:13:42,171
You're great.
You just can't cradle her from New York.

1561
01:13:42,255 --> 01:13:43,796
Bitch, I will be her fairy godmother.

1562
01:13:43,880 --> 01:13:45,546
Okay? I will flit back and forth

1563
01:13:45,630 --> 01:13:47,171
to wherever she is, like a fairy.

1564
01:13:47,255 --> 01:13:48,564
Okay, the fact that you said "bitch"

1565
01:13:48,588 --> 01:13:50,869
while you're holding my baby means
that you are not ready.

1566
01:13:51,213 --> 01:13:53,546
Um, so you're still planning
to go to New York?

1567
01:13:53,630 --> 01:13:54,838
Yeah. I have to be on-site

1568
01:13:54,921 --> 01:13:57,106
- to get the restaurant up and running.
- [baby fussing]

1569
01:13:57,130 --> 01:14:00,755
Oh, I... I just, I don't know.
I thought you'd stay here for a while.

1570
01:14:01,963 --> 01:14:05,130
I was actually hoping you'd come with me.
It'd be so fun to be there with you.

1571
01:14:05,463 --> 01:14:08,588
I'm sure they have dive bars in New York
where you can play for free.

1572
01:14:09,046 --> 01:14:10,046
Right?

1573
01:14:10,130 --> 01:14:12,130
Yes. Godmother Sasha.

1574
01:14:12,463 --> 01:14:15,880
- I'm gonna godmother the shit out of you.
- That's another strike.

01:14:34,755 --> 01:14:35,796
No, you're fine.

1579
01:14:36,046 --> 01:14:38,046
They'll just assume you're a K-pop Star.

1580
01:14:39,838 --> 01:14:41,005
Coats required, sir.

1581
01:14:42,380 --> 01:14:43,588
Shit.

1582
01:14:45,755 --> 01:14:47,671
You don't have anything less roomy?

1583
01:14:47,755 --> 01:14:49,005
This is all we have, sir.

1584
01:14:49,505 --> 01:14:50,505
What about those?

1585
01:14:50,963 --> 01:14:52,588
No. Those aren't available.

1586
01:14:52,880 --> 01:14:54,939
- [Marcus] They're not available?
- No, they belong to people.

1587
01:14:54,963 --> 01:14:57,255
Right, and this one doesn't belong
to people,

1588
01:14:57,338 --> 01:15:00,880
- because nobody is this big, right?
- [attendant] The gentleman died, sir.

1589
01:15:00,963 --> 01:15:03,022
- The person who owned this died?
- [attendant] Yes, that's correct.

1590
01:15:03,046 --> 01:15:04,296
Oh, André the Giant.

1591
01:15:04,380 --> 01:15:07,255
- It was André the Giant?
- [attendant] He was a larger gentleman.

1592
01:15:09,421 --> 01:15:11,296
- [footsteps approaching]
- [laughs]

1593
01:15:12,046 --> 01:15:15,005
You look like 1980s Ellen
when she did stand-up.

1594
01:15:15,630 --> 01:15:18,546
- [cameras shutters clicking]
- Shut up. I am doing this for you.

1595
01:15:18,630 --> 01:15:20,630
Hey, you're pulling it off. It's okay.

1596
01:15:22,046 --> 01:15:24,963
Good evening.
Lamb carpaccio with a Caesar ice cream?

1597
01:15:25,046 --> 01:15:26,838
Absolutely not, thank you.

1598
01:15:27,796 --> 01:15:28,630
Quail egg parfait?

1599
01:15:28,713 --> 01:15:30,963
Rather shoot myself in the face, thanks.

1600
01:15:32,338 --> 01:15:33,588
What? I said thank you.

1601
01:15:34,630 --> 01:15:36,939
[Sasha] Sorry, I have to do
this red carpet thing real quick, okay?

1602
01:15:36,963 --> 01:15:38,171
[Marcus] Okay.

1603
01:15:40,130 --> 01:15:41,338
Can you hold my purse?

1604
01:15:41,963 --> 01:15:43,255
- Oh, yeah, sure.
- Great.

1605

- [camera shutters clicking]
- [indistinct chatter]

1606
01:15:46,463 --> 01:15:47,755
[reporter 1] Hey! Love it!

1607
01:15:47,838 --> 01:15:51,755
[reporter 2] Sasha, smile!
Smile! You look gorgeous!

1608
01:15:51,838 --> 01:15:53,713
- Yeah.
- [reporter 3] Thank you, Sasha.

1609
01:15:54,338 --> 01:15:57,546
Sasha! Tell us about your new
San Francisco restaurant, Saintly Fare.

1610
01:15:57,630 --> 01:16:00,231
Oh, all I can say is it's gonna be
something different, innovative.

1611
01:16:00,255 --> 01:16:02,439
- [reporter 4] Love it!
- How are you handling the breakup

1612
01:16:02,463 --> 01:16:03,380
with Brandon Choi?

1613
01:16:03,463 --> 01:16:05,130
I wish Brandon nothing but the best.

1614
01:16:05,213 --> 01:16:08,046
It was just time for us
to go in different directions.

1615
01:16:08,213 --> 01:16:09,921
But I'm here tonight
with my new boyfriend,

1616
01:16:10,546 --> 01:16:11,755
Marcus Kim.

1617
01:16:12,963 --> 01:16:17,130
- [reporter 5] Is he a chef, too?
- [Sasha] No, no, no, he's in heat and air.

1618
01:16:17,213 --> 01:16:18,755
He's just a regular guy.

1619
01:16:20,088 --> 01:16:22,488
- [indistinct chatter]
- [reporter 6] Sasha, nice to see you.

1620
01:16:30,546 --> 01:16:33,338
[Sasha] God, I can't believe
we're opening Saintly Fare tonight.

1621
01:16:33,421 --> 01:16:34,921
Phew, I'm nervous.

1622
01:16:35,296 --> 01:16:37,213
You thought the last event was crazy?

1623
01:16:37,296 --> 01:16:38,755
Wait till you see what it's like

1624
01:16:38,838 --> 01:16:40,921
- opening night of a restaurant.
- [Marcus] Hmm.

1625
01:16:41,046 --> 01:16:43,713
I'm just glad this is the last thing
for a while.

1626
01:16:43,796 --> 01:16:44,713
Well... [scoffs]

1627
01:16:44,796 --> 01:16:47,463
not really. Remember,
I'm off to New York next week.

1628
01:16:47,921 --> 01:16:49,296
You're still coming, right?

1629
01:16:50,088 --> 01:16:51,296
Oh, um...

1630
01:16:51,880 --> 01:16:54,921
Well, I'm not sure I can, I got my dad
and that Southie's audition, so...

1631
01:16:55,421 --> 01:16:56,921
So, come after the audition.

1632
01:16:57,255 --> 01:17:00,880
Well, maybe. We'll see.
So, when are you planning on coming back?

1633
01:17:02,046 --> 01:17:03,046
I wasn't.

1634
01:17:03,921 --> 01:17:06,338
I'm... moving on to the next thing.

1635
01:17:06,755 --> 01:17:07,755
You know?

1636
01:17:08,255 --> 01:17:11,546
Oh, right. Right.
It's because you're a celebrity chef.

1637
01:17:11,755 --> 01:17:13,921
[scoffs]
Who came up with that term anyway?

1638
01:17:14,005 --> 01:17:15,255
It's so pretentious.

1639
01:17:15,505 --> 01:17:17,505
Great, well, it wasn't me, okay?

1640
01:17:20,171 --> 01:17:21,796
You know what other term I hate?

1641
01:17:22,046 --> 01:17:23,796
"Elevated Asian cuisine."

1642
01:17:24,130 --> 01:17:27,255
Asian food isn't supposed to be
"elevated." It's supposed to be authentic.

1643
01:17:27,338 --> 01:17:29,213
That's what you used to make with my mom.

1644
01:17:29,296 --> 01:17:31,338
I don't know why you're doing
this kinda stuff now.

1645
01:17:31,421 --> 01:17:34,296
[scoffs] Oh, so now you're saying
my food isn't authentic.

1646
01:17:34,380 --> 01:17:35,671
[Marcus] It's not authentic.

1647
01:17:35,755 --> 01:17:37,921
Asian food shouldn't be served
in a shot glass.

1648
01:17:38,005 --> 01:17:39,838
It should be served in a big ass bowl.

1649
01:17:39,921 --> 01:17:42,130
You're just catering to rich white people.

1650
01:17:42,213 --> 01:17:45,213
Well, if you think I'm such a sellout,
then why are you dating me?

1651
01:17:45,296 --> 01:17:48,046
If you think I'm just a regular guy,
then why are you dating me?

1652
01:17:48,130 --> 01:17:48,963
Oh, I know,

1653
01:17:49,046 --> 01:17:50,647
it's because you need someone
to carry your purse.

1654
01:17:50,671 --> 01:17:53,005
I called you "a regular guy"
as a compliment.

1655
01:17:53,088 --> 01:17:55,439
- You aren't caught up in all the bullshit.
- The way you are?

1656
01:17:55,463 --> 01:17:56,463
Oh, right.

1657
01:17:56,630 --> 01:18:00,880
Instead, you smoke weed every night
'cause that's so much more noble.

1658
01:18:00,963 --> 01:18:03,671
God forbid someone relax
in Sasha Tran's presence.

1659
01:18:03,755 --> 01:18:06,130
[Sasha] Don't shame me
for going after things, Marcus!

1660
01:18:06,213 --> 01:18:08,397
- You're so scared to do anything new.
- [Marcus] I'm not scared.

1661
01:18:08,421 --> 01:18:11,463
Okay? I just don't want to be some dude
on your arm

1662
01:18:11,546 --> 01:18:12,981
so you don't have to show up
to places alone.
