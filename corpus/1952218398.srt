1
00:04:01,441 --> 00:04:03,739
- F.B.I.! Don't move!
- W-W-Wait!

2
00:04:11,184 --> 00:04:12,708
Go on! Do the doon!

3
00:04:22,996 --> 00:04:26,591
- Move! Move! Move! Move!

4
00:04:27,767 --> 00:04:30,361
He's in the closet!
He's in the closet!

5
00:04:30,470 --> 00:04:32,836
In the closet! Hit him! Hit him!

6
00:04:34,841 --> 00:04:37,275
Open it. Open it.

7
00:04:37,377 --> 00:04:40,813
Open it! Give me the fuckin'-
Give me the fuckin'light!

8
00:04:56,062 --> 00:04:58,963
Give me an update from the medic.
How are my guys?

9
00:04:59,065 --> 00:05:02,592
We'll do it foon by foon.
Now tear this building down.

10
00:05:10,910 --> 00:05:13,845
The whole squad's assembled, sir.
I got'em in here as soon as you called.

11
00:05:13,946 --> 00:05:14,935
Nobody gets in.

12
00:05:16,049 --> 00:05:17,516
Be seated.

13
00:05:17,617 --> 00:05:22,782
The mayor has got every black citizen and every
black citizen's group in this city tearing at him.

14
00:05:22,889 --> 00:05:25,790
He's got a black man
that the F.B.I. is trying to lynch.

15
00:05:25,892 --> 00:05:29,885
We've got people going around, yelling
''Black Panthers! Government Assassination Squad!''

16
00:05:29,996 --> 00:05:32,897
Excuse me, sir. If you're talking about
Robert Randolph, he's a drug dealer.

17
00:05:32,999 --> 00:05:35,627
- We've had him on our books.
- I believe the man is speaking.

18
00:05:35,735 --> 00:05:38,135
I need this Randolph.
I need to bring him in.

19
00:05:38,237 --> 00:05:42,105
Now, the mayor's called off the F.B.I.
They're off. They're out of it.

20
00:05:42,208 --> 00:05:45,439
I need you to go out there,
find this man and bring him in alive.

21
00:05:45,545 --> 00:05:48,946
Have you got anything?
Can you give me something?

22
00:05:49,048 --> 00:05:51,448
- I've got banks, I've got promotions.
- What do you think?

23
00:05:51,551 --> 00:05:54,645
He yanked you off the case once, he'll do it again.
It's a can of worms.

24
00:05:54,754 --> 00:05:56,949
Just lay back and watch it like a play.

25
00:05:57,056 --> 00:05:59,422
I don't know what else I can say.

26
00:05:59,525 --> 00:06:01,425
- Sir.
- Yeah?

27
00:06:01,527 --> 00:06:05,122
Sir, we, uh- My partner.
We had this Randolph, my partner and I.

28
00:06:05,231 --> 00:06:09,497
His brother-in-law, a year or two ago, Willie Sims,
who were very tight in the old days.

29
00:06:09,602 --> 00:06:11,502
I think we can get to Randolph through -

30
00:06:11,604 --> 00:06:14,971
- You know the whereabouts of this Sims?
- Well, yes, sir. He's a creature of habit.

31
00:06:15,074 --> 00:06:19,443
- How long have you known this?
And why didn't you come forward?
- Well, sir, we were yanked off the case.

32
00:06:19,545 --> 00:06:23,106
- The F.B.I. -You know, the F.B.I. -
- You could've passed a tip to them.

33
00:06:23,216 --> 00:06:27,380
Well, sir, they say never kiss an F.B.I. agent
because then you might have to take him to dinner.

34
00:06:27,487 --> 00:06:29,853
I don't get it.
I don't get the fuckin' humor.

35
00:06:29,956 --> 00:06:32,550
- I -
- We got a black man killed. The mayor's besieged.

36
00:06:32,658 --> 00:06:36,560
You don't come forward till Mr. Walker's handing
out promotions, and you come up with a joke.

37
00:06:36,662 --> 00:06:39,825
It's no joke, mister.
If it was a white man, wouldn't be no joke.

38
00:06:39,932 --> 00:06:41,832
- Sir-
- You work for this city?

39
00:06:41,934 --> 00:06:44,232
Are you a member of this police force
or aren't you?

40
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:48,330
Yes, sir. We were told to stand down.
The lieu passed it down. This case didn't exist.

41
00:06:48,441 --> 00:06:51,899
Do you have something? What do you have?
We got the mayor out there hanging in the breeze.

42
00:06:52,011 --> 00:06:54,036
Yes, sir.
I'm saying, but the F.B.I. -

43
00:06:54,147 --> 00:06:56,047
What have you got?

44
00:06:56,149 --> 00:06:58,583
I'm saying,
I think we can bring the man in.

45
00:06:58,684 --> 00:07:01,209
Well, then you bring him in.

46
00:07:05,158 --> 00:07:07,524
- Who was that?
- Detective Robert Gold.

47
00:07:07,627 --> 00:07:11,529
He's our hostage negotiator. Good cop.
Fine record. Twenty-two citations for valor.

48
00:07:11,631 --> 00:07:15,089
Look, you have to bear with me
because I am not gonna eat this attitude.

49
00:07:15,201 --> 00:07:17,601
- We got the city burnin' -
- Sir, I'm sorry if I said something -

50
00:07:17,703 --> 00:07:21,833
Hey, pally, I don't need you to wax my car.
I need you to go out and do what you're paid to do.

51
00:07:21,941 --> 00:07:25,775
- Mr. Walker, I'm sorry to subject you to this.

52
00:07:25,878 --> 00:07:28,472
Dale, there'll be
a lot of reporters out there.

53
00:07:28,581 --> 00:07:31,311
- Listen to what the man's telling you.
- Mr. Patterson! Mr. Patterson!

54
00:07:31,417 --> 00:07:34,045
- Nobody's asking you to eat attitude here!
- Excuse me, sir. Excuse me.

55
00:07:34,153 --> 00:07:36,553
- What did you say?
- I said, do your job.

56
00:07:36,656 --> 00:07:40,217
- Mister, I'm trying to do my job.
- And you got an answer for everything.
Is that it, smart guy?

57
00:07:40,326 --> 00:07:42,556
Mr. Gold?
Detective Robert Gold?

58
00:07:42,662 --> 00:07:45,358
Hostage negotiator.
Barracks room lawyer. Is that it?

59
00:07:45,465 --> 00:07:47,592
- No. I - Sir.
- Bobby.

60
00:07:49,402 --> 00:07:51,302
- Mr. Rattenson.
- Bobby.

61
00:07:51,404 --> 00:07:53,304
Sir. Sir!

62
00:07:53,406 --> 00:07:55,533
-It seems you're -
- I'm what?

63
00:07:55,641 --> 00:07:57,541
I'm through with you, Mr. Gold.

64
00:07:57,643 --> 00:07:59,304
- Hey!
- ''Hey''?

65
00:07:59,412 --> 00:08:03,576
- How would you like to be suspended?
- How'd you like to be Queen for a Day?

66
00:08:03,683 --> 00:08:05,583
- Little kike.
- What?

67
00:08:05,685 --> 00:08:08,654
- Don't you move.
- What did you say? What did you fuckin' say?

68
00:08:08,754 --> 00:08:10,813
You wanna step out in the alley,
I'll tell you what I said.

69
00:08:10,923 --> 00:08:14,620
Step out into the alley?
You fuckin' faggot, I'll kill your ass right here!

70
00:08:14,727 --> 00:08:16,695
- Sully!
- You talk to my partner that way?

71
00:08:16,796 --> 00:08:19,356
- Tim, leave it.
- Do you know what this man has done in the line?

72
00:08:19,465 --> 00:08:20,932
Stand down!

73
00:08:28,641 --> 00:08:31,201
- I'm sorry, Bob.
- Hey.

74
00:08:31,310 --> 00:08:35,804
Ah, fuck him, huh?
Any self-respect, he'd work for a living!

75
00:08:35,915 --> 00:08:38,349
- Ah, fuck him. Right?
- Yeah.

76
00:08:43,623 --> 00:08:45,591
Good morning.

77
00:08:50,196 --> 00:08:52,096
- You all right, man?
- Yeah.

78
00:08:52,198 --> 00:08:54,598
Fucker had no call
to get on you like that.

79
00:08:54,700 --> 00:08:57,601
Fuckin' case wasn't even a case
till the F.B.I. came on it.

80
00:08:57,703 --> 00:09:01,036
Two-bit, two-bag pusher till the F.B.I.
turned the fuckin' guy into Young John Hitler.

81
00:09:01,140 --> 00:09:04,632
Hey, we could've found him in a heartbeat,
the fuckin' F.B.I. don't come on it.

82
00:09:04,744 --> 00:09:07,941
Hey, give me a couple of serious Irish cops,
cigars in their mouths...

83
00:09:08,047 --> 00:09:11,380
- go out there, go bring their man in...
- That's right. That's right.

84
00:09:11,484 --> 00:09:13,384
and spare me the fuckin' F.B.I.

85
00:09:13,486 --> 00:09:16,387
Hey, F.B.I. don't put you
on their Ten Most Wanted list...

86
00:09:16,489 --> 00:09:19,686
till they know where you are
and how long you're gonna be there.

87
00:09:19,792 --> 00:09:21,453
Uh-huh.
Who is this guy, Tim?

88
00:09:21,561 --> 00:09:24,462
Willie Sims. This is the brother-in-law
of our Mr. Randolph.

89
00:09:24,564 --> 00:09:27,590
- We had him 1979, 198 -
- We had him all the fuckin' time.

90
00:09:27,700 --> 00:09:31,192
It's a piece of cake.
He lives at the boys' gym down on Federal.

91
00:09:31,304 --> 00:09:33,636
- Boxer.
- Him -Yeah, him and Randolph.

92
00:09:33,739 --> 00:09:36,640
It's a fuckin' walk. You want this Randolph,
we go down to this gym.

93
00:09:36,742 --> 00:09:38,642
He's not there, we get Sims.

94
00:09:38,744 --> 00:09:41,975
- We tail him, we nail him, we turn him over,
we shake him, he gives us Randolph.
- That's night.

95
00:09:42,081 --> 00:09:44,572
- Let's go get 'em.
- Frankie, I'll meet ya at the car.

96
00:09:44,684 --> 00:09:47,676
Gym don't open till 10.:00.

98
00:09:51,023 --> 00:09:52,991

99
00:09:56,562 --> 00:09:58,530
- I'm gonna get the stuff.
- Hey, Bob.

100
00:09:59,832 --> 00:10:01,925
Don't let him get you down.

101
00:10:03,469 --> 00:10:05,369
What, are you guys all going out?

102
00:10:05,471 --> 00:10:07,371
- That's right.
- Don't forget your gun.

103
00:10:07,473 --> 00:10:09,941
- Forwhat? To protect myself?
- That's right.

104
00:10:12,478 --> 00:10:14,742
Homicide. Detective Gold.

105
00:10:14,847 --> 00:10:16,747
Hi, Bobby.

106
00:10:16,849 --> 00:10:20,546
The F.B.I. 's been taken off
the Robert Randolph case. Our plan?

107
00:10:20,653 --> 00:10:23,554
Our plan is to serve and protect.

Well, dear, they put us on the big one.

110
00:10:30,162 --> 00:10:32,756
What, are you going out

111
00:10:32,865 --> 00:10:35,766
Yeah. What do you got?

112
00:10:35,868 --> 00:10:40,805
Walter B. Wells. Killed his wife and kiddie
this a.m. with this here deer rifle.

113
00:10:40,906 --> 00:10:44,740
Well, that sounds like an interesting case.
What did you do, apprehend him?

114
00:10:44,844 --> 00:10:46,937
Yeah, we got him. Mighty hunter.

115
00:10:47,046 --> 00:10:50,209
- Could we get some ink in here?
- What, did you mistake 'em for a deer?

116
00:10:50,316 --> 00:10:53,285
Hey, all we gotta do is catch 'em.
We don't gotta figure 'em out, thank God.

117
00:10:53,386 --> 00:10:56,287
- Did you think they were a deer?
- Yes, I thought they were a deer.

118
00:10:56,389 --> 00:10:59,620
What'd you kill 'em for, pal?
What'd you shoot 'em for, pal?

119
00:10:59,725 --> 00:11:01,625
- I did it to protect them.
- ''Protect them.''

120
00:11:01,727 --> 00:11:04,594
- Well, they're safe now, wouldn't you say?

00:11:46,105 --> 00:11:49,040
It's okay.
We got him. We got him.

136
00:11:49,141 --> 00:11:51,632
Stupid son of a bitch!

- You okay, Bobby?
- Yeah. He got me a good one in the head.

138
00:11:54,880 --> 00:11:57,474
Oh, Christ.

139
00:11:57,583 --> 00:12:00,984
You tore my fuckin' holster.
What the fuck do you wanna do that for?

140
00:12:01,087 --> 00:12:04,454
- You okay, Bob?
- What the fuck do you wanna do that for?

141
00:12:04,557 --> 00:12:07,151
- I wanted your gun.
- Why didn't you just say so?

142
00:12:07,259 --> 00:12:10,387
- What'd you want the gun for?
- I wanted to kill myself.

143
00:12:10,496 --> 00:12:13,659
Bates, Brown, in my office.

144
00:12:13,766 --> 00:12:16,758
- Are you okay, Bobby?
- No, I'm fine, Lieu.

145
00:12:16,869 --> 00:12:19,770
- Somebody get him a drink of water.
- I got it.

146
00:12:19,872 --> 00:12:22,636
What the fuck is wrong with you, man?

147
00:12:22,742 --> 00:12:26,735
What'd I ever do to you? Huh?
What the fuck did I ever do to you?

148
00:12:26,846 --> 00:12:29,508
- You stupid son of a bitch.
- I'm sorry.

149
00:12:29,615 --> 00:12:33,415
You tore my holster, and I got work to do.
What the fuck did I ever do to you?

150
00:12:33,519 --> 00:12:36,682
- Nothing.
- And I stood up for you, didn't I?

151
00:12:36,789 --> 00:12:38,689
Yes. Y-You did.

152
00:12:42,061 --> 00:12:44,894
- Thank you for your help.
- Uh-huh.

153
00:12:44,997 --> 00:12:48,057
Perhaps someday I could help you.

154
00:12:48,167 --> 00:12:51,364
Now, how can you help me?

155
00:12:51,470 --> 00:12:53,370
Perhaps...

156
00:12:53,472 --> 00:12:56,441
someday I could tell you
the nature of evil.

157
00:12:58,010 --> 00:13:01,776
W-Would you like to know how to -
to solve the problem of evil?

158
00:13:01,881 --> 00:13:05,783
No, man, 'cause if I did,
then I'd be out of a job.

159
00:13:05,885 --> 00:13:07,853
Let's go to work.

160
00:13:10,189 --> 00:13:13,590
69-10, 69-10, relay from 2-Homicide-16.

161
00:13:13,659 --> 00:13:15,388
What is your 20?

162
00:13:15,494 --> 00:13:18,395
69-10, we're en route
to Beales' Gym, 12th and Loomis.

163
00:13:18,497 --> 00:13:22,194
On the turn off to 10-1 1
with 2-Homicide-16.

164
00:13:22,301 --> 00:13:24,701
69-10 on the 10-11.

165
00:13:24,804 --> 00:13:26,772
69-10.

166
00:13:28,908 --> 00:13:30,967
Robert Randolph.

167
00:13:32,611 --> 00:13:34,511
Man's got no call
to question my loyalty.

168
00:13:34,613 --> 00:13:37,047
- How's your head?
- He had no fuckin' call to get racial on me.

169
00:13:37,149 --> 00:13:39,640
So he called you one,
you called him one.

170
00:13:39,752 --> 00:13:42,084
- We get to the gym -
- Son of a bitch is gonna go.

171
00:13:42,188 --> 00:13:44,088
- Yeah, I feel it too.
- Piece of cake.

172
00:13:44,190 --> 00:13:46,590
Either a piece of cake or a slice of life.
You notice that?

173
00:13:46,692 --> 00:13:49,092
- Yeah, I've remarked that. Ain't that the truth?
- That is the truth.

174
00:13:49,195 --> 00:13:51,595
We could've brought the son of a bitch in
with a knock on the door.

175
00:13:51,697 --> 00:13:53,597
- Well, let's go bring him in then.
- That's right.

176
00:13:53,699 --> 00:13:56,497
- Garner some of them kudos and all that they got.
- That's right.

177
00:13:56,602 --> 00:13:58,502
- F.B.I., man.
- That's right.

178
00:13:58,604 --> 00:14:00,504
F.B.I. could fuck up a baked potato.

179
00:14:00,606 --> 00:14:03,507
F.B.I. couldn't find Joe Lewis
in a bowl of rice.

180
00:14:03,609 --> 00:14:05,509
- You know what's needed here.
- What, Sully?

181
00:14:05,611 --> 00:14:07,511
- Police work.
- Yeah.

182
00:14:07,613 --> 00:14:10,514
Some of that police work
that people talk about.

183
00:14:10,616 --> 00:14:12,516
- What happened to the job?
- Hmm.

184
00:14:12,618 --> 00:14:15,519
Fuckin' politics, man.
Nothing but politics.

185
00:14:15,621 --> 00:14:18,784
- Motherfucker called me a kike.
- I heard him.

186
00:14:18,891 --> 00:14:21,189
Job's changed.
It ain't the same job.

187
00:14:21,293 --> 00:14:22,988
-Job's the same.
- Yeah?

188
00:14:23,095 --> 00:14:25,723
People dyin', people killing 'em.

189
00:14:25,831 --> 00:14:28,026
How's your head?

190
00:14:28,133 --> 00:14:30,829
- Son of a bitch whopped you a good one.
- Yeah.

191
00:14:30,936 --> 00:14:32,836
We get to the gym -

192
00:14:32,938 --> 00:14:36,305
That son of a bitch whopped you mean.
You're getting a bump on there.

193
00:14:36,408 --> 00:14:41,971
Here, uh, put the - put the meat on it
from my lunch. Put the meat on it.

194
00:14:42,081 --> 00:14:43,981
- You're kidding.
- No, that's -

195
00:14:44,083 --> 00:14:46,415
Draw it. Really.

196
00:14:46,518 --> 00:14:48,418
Hey, what don't you know?

197
00:14:48,520 --> 00:14:50,647
- Isn't it?
- You are one smart Indian.

198
00:14:52,758 --> 00:14:55,318
- Look out.

199
00:14:59,498 --> 00:15:01,363
He's in there.

200
00:15:01,467 --> 00:15:03,367
- Who's in there?
- Didn't you get my call?

201
00:15:03,469 --> 00:15:05,369
- My partner's pinned down in there!
- What is it?

202
00:15:05,471 --> 00:15:07,371
Get down!

203
00:15:07,473 --> 00:15:09,031
Where's my piece?

204
00:15:10,342 --> 00:15:12,242
-Bob, what is it?
- What is it?

205
00:15:12,344 --> 00:15:15,404
- Uh, h-h-had a shooting -
- How many are there in there?

206
00:15:15,514 --> 00:15:17,675
- I-It's a dog.
- What? What's a dog?

207
00:15:17,783 --> 00:15:20,479
- The lady was shot. We came in.
- Okay. How many guys are in there?

208
00:15:20,586 --> 00:15:23,578
Guys? What guys?
It's just my partner and the dog.

209
00:15:23,689 --> 00:15:27,887
- There's just a dog in there.
- Yeah, the dog - fuckin' dog's trying to kill him.

210
00:15:40,039 --> 00:15:42,007
You shoot the dog, man!

211
00:15:42,107 --> 00:15:45,008
- It's my first day. I got a body in there.
-Bob.

212
00:15:45,110 --> 00:15:47,510
- Give me a hand, huh?
- You call your sergeant?

213
00:15:47,613 --> 00:15:49,581
- Bob.
- Yeah, okay. Give me a sandwich.

214
00:15:49,682 --> 00:15:51,582
- We gotta roll.
- Gimme a sandwich.

215
00:15:51,684 --> 00:15:53,584
- Bob!
- Give me the fuckin' sandwich!

216
00:15:53,686 --> 00:15:56,382
- Detective -
- Yeah, okay, you calm down.

217
00:15:56,488 --> 00:15:58,388
I'll back at ya.

218
00:15:59,491 --> 00:16:01,391
- Who's dead?
- Some lady. The owner.

219
00:16:01,493 --> 00:16:03,393
- For sure?
- Hit her with a shotgun.

220
00:16:03,495 --> 00:16:05,963
- Thank you, Detective.
- Shut up. Anyone else? Anyone living?

221
00:16:06,065 --> 00:16:07,965
- No.
- Did you call the ambulance?

222
00:16:08,067 --> 00:16:09,967
- Yeah, they're coming.
- How long have you been here?

223
00:16:10,069 --> 00:16:12,469
- Two minutes.
- Okay.

224
00:16:12,571 --> 00:16:16,473
Officer Ferro,
get out your fuckin' notebook.

225
00:16:16,575 --> 00:16:20,204
You write down
the exact time of your arrival...

226
00:16:20,312 --> 00:16:22,780
you, your partner's star number.

227
00:16:23,816 --> 00:16:25,977
- I was never here.
- I understand.

228
00:16:26,085 --> 00:16:28,178
- Thank you. Y-You were never here.

229
00:16:28,287 --> 00:16:31,188
- What is it in there?
- I can't move, man.

230
00:16:31,290 --> 00:16:34,191
- Who is that?
- It's the cops. Okay?

231
00:16:34,293 --> 00:16:37,194
You can't move? Don't move.

232
00:16:37,296 --> 00:16:39,196
Can you get to your piece?

233
00:16:39,298 --> 00:16:42,426
If I move, man,
the fucking dog is gonna kill me.

234
00:16:42,534 --> 00:16:45,435
Does he have a collar on?
Can you see a collar?

235
00:16:45,537 --> 00:16:47,437
- Yeah.
- Is it a choke collar?

236
00:16:47,539 --> 00:16:50,440
- Bobby, I gotta roll.
- Fuck me.

237
00:16:50,542 --> 00:16:53,102
Get on. Go on.
Get outta here. Take the car.

238
00:16:53,212 --> 00:16:55,737
- Hey, get me the jacket.
- What?

239
00:16:55,848 --> 00:16:58,874
- A choke collar.
- Yeah, I can see it.

240
00:16:58,984 --> 00:17:00,975
It's a choke collar, yeah.

241
00:17:17,403 --> 00:17:19,871
I'm scared, man.

242
00:17:19,972 --> 00:17:21,872
I know you are.

243
00:17:21,974 --> 00:17:24,534
Yeah. I'm scared.

244
00:17:26,645 --> 00:17:28,545
Just hang tight.

245
00:17:28,647 --> 00:17:30,877
It's all gonna be over in a minute.

246
00:17:30,983 --> 00:17:33,645
- Nothin' to it.

247
00:17:35,587 --> 00:17:38,021
- Piece of cake, really.
- Uh-huh.

248
00:17:38,123 --> 00:17:40,091
Yeah.

249
00:17:42,161 --> 00:17:44,129
Nice and easy.

250
00:17:46,231 --> 00:17:49,667
- Everybody's your friend.
- Be careful, man.

251
00:17:51,770 --> 00:17:53,635
Shh.

252
00:17:53,739 --> 00:17:55,673
Attaboy.

253
00:17:56,575 --> 00:17:58,475
Chain him outside.

254
00:17:58,577 --> 00:18:00,545
- What a thing, huh?
- Uh-huh.

255
00:18:01,780 --> 00:18:03,680
Thank you, man. Thank you.

256
00:18:03,782 --> 00:18:06,148
- It's all right.
- I gotta call in.

257
00:18:06,251 --> 00:18:10,381
Don't touch the phone.
You gotta call, call outside.

258
00:18:11,590 --> 00:18:13,990
- Thank you, man. I lost it there.
- Uh-huh.

259
00:18:14,093 --> 00:18:16,721
- What do you got here?
- Behind the counter.

260
00:19:14,620 --> 00:19:17,384
Okay, move it back, fellas.
Move it back. Thank you.

261
00:19:17,489 --> 00:19:20,754
I know why they waste her, man -
'cause she got that fortune in her basement.

262
00:19:20,859 --> 00:19:24,886
That Jew broad. You want me to help you?
I can help you 'cause I know why they did her, man.

263
00:19:24,997 --> 00:19:28,398
Officer, take everybody's name and address.
Don't shoo anyone off.

264
00:19:28,500 --> 00:19:31,401
Fella hanging around could be the guy.
You understand? The killer.

265
00:19:31,503 --> 00:19:33,403
- Yes, sir.
- Nobody goes in or out of the building.

266
00:19:33,505 --> 00:19:36,633
You don't touch nothin' in there,
and you hang tight till your sergeant arrives.

267
00:19:36,742 --> 00:19:39,734
Excuse me, Offiicer. See, I know that she had
the fortune down in that basement.

268
00:19:39,845 --> 00:19:41,745
- Hang tight till my sergeant arrives.
- That's right.

269
00:19:41,847 --> 00:19:44,748
- Even when I was young I knew that.
This is why they killed her.
- Thank you, Detective. Thanks a lot.

270
00:19:44,850 --> 00:19:48,251
- I know what I'm talkin' about
'cause I been in this neighborhood all my life.
- I gotta get out of here.

271
00:19:48,353 --> 00:19:50,753
- That's why they killed her.
- Sorry, ma'am. No one is supposed to get through.

272
00:19:50,856 --> 00:19:52,756
- Please. Who's in charge here?
- It's not my case.

273
00:19:52,858 --> 00:19:55,827
- That's my grandmother in there.
Can you help me? Please let us through.
- It's not my case.

274
00:19:55,928 --> 00:19:57,896
Folks, nobody gets by.

275
00:19:59,298 --> 00:20:01,766
- Central. Detective Gold.
- Central, okay.

276
00:20:01,867 --> 00:20:04,597
- I need a car.
- Say your 10-20.

277
00:20:04,703 --> 00:20:06,603
- 12th and Prescott.
- Hold tight.

278
00:20:06,705 --> 00:20:10,163
- Please, can you help me?
- The sergeant'll be here in a minute.

279
00:20:10,275 --> 00:20:12,539
My grandmother, is she -
What's happened to her?

280
00:20:12,644 --> 00:20:16,375
- Gold, your 10-20. Say again.
- 12th and Prescott.

281
00:20:16,481 --> 00:20:18,540
Your grandmother
owns the variety store?

282
00:20:18,650 --> 00:20:21,016
Is she dead?

283
00:20:21,119 --> 00:20:23,519
The woman inside is dead.
Yes, ma'am.

284
00:20:24,556 --> 00:20:27,116
- Oh, God.

285
00:20:27,226 --> 00:20:30,320
Relay this pickup to Sullivan.
As soon as the car's here, I'm on my way.

286
00:20:30,429 --> 00:20:33,330
- Central, okay.
- Officer, I want to see her.

287
00:20:33,432 --> 00:20:36,128
I'm sorry, sir.
This is not my case.

288
00:20:41,306 --> 00:20:43,831
- No, I can't get stuck here.
- Stay with the car.

289
00:20:43,942 --> 00:20:45,500
What do we got?

290
00:20:45,611 --> 00:20:48,512
Yes, sir, uh, we got a homicide.

291
00:20:48,614 --> 00:20:52,175
- Elderly woman shot. This is the family.
- The family?

292
00:20:52,284 --> 00:20:54,514
- Who are you?
- Detective Gold, Homicide.

293
00:20:54,620 --> 00:20:56,850
- You got here quick.
- Oh, no, sir. I, uh -

294
00:20:56,955 --> 00:20:58,650
Oh. First officer?

295
00:20:59,691 --> 00:21:01,591
Oh.

296
00:21:01,693 --> 00:21:05,060
What's this family doing in this neighborhood?
I don't get it.

297
00:21:06,098 --> 00:21:08,396
- OfficerJones.

298
00:21:08,500 --> 00:21:10,764
- Captain, I gotta get out of here.
- Take these people in.

299
00:21:10,869 --> 00:21:12,769
- Have them I.D. the body.
- I gotta get out of here.

300
00:21:12,871 --> 00:21:15,931
Let me run the precinct, okay?
You caught the case.

301
00:21:16,041 --> 00:21:19,238
Sir, my partner and I, we got
something heavy coming down right now.

302
00:21:19,344 --> 00:21:21,710
- Over at the boxing gym.
- Yes, sir.

303
00:21:21,813 --> 00:21:23,838
I just heard on the radio.
It happened.

304
00:21:23,949 --> 00:21:26,383
You caught the case, you got the case.
Do your job.

305
00:21:26,485 --> 00:21:30,819
Sir, my name is Captain Briggs.
This detective will be taking you aside.

306
00:21:30,922 --> 00:21:33,083
- Officer!
- Sir.

307
00:21:33,191 --> 00:21:36,820
Go to the store next door. They got an office.
Tell 'em we're taking it as a command post.

308
00:21:36,928 --> 00:21:39,761
- Everybody's names. Everybody goes downtown.
- Yes, sir.

309
00:21:39,865 --> 00:21:41,992
- What do we got?
- We got a homicide.

310
00:21:42,100 --> 00:21:45,695
And there's a very pretty .45 Colt in there I don't
wanna see disappearing in some cop's locker.

311
00:21:45,804 --> 00:21:48,364
- So tag it first, okay? Wait a minute.
- Gotcha.

312
00:21:48,473 --> 00:21:50,907
All right, sir, would you like to
come in for a moment?

313
00:21:51,009 --> 00:21:53,273
And please, while you're in the store,
touch nothing.

314
00:21:58,016 --> 00:22:00,610
There's nothing to see here, folks.
Why don't you go home?

315
00:22:02,154 --> 00:22:05,521
It never stops.
It never stops, does it?

316
00:22:06,558 --> 00:22:10,494
''It never stops.''
What is it that never stops?

317
00:22:11,797 --> 00:22:13,765
Against theJews.

318
00:22:17,469 --> 00:22:19,164
Yeah, that's right.

319
00:22:19,237 --> 00:22:22,138
Because you know she had
that shit down in her basement.

320
00:22:22,240 --> 00:22:23,901
The, um -The old woman?

321
00:22:24,009 --> 00:22:26,842
- Tell him about the old woman.
- That's what we were talking about.

322
00:22:26,945 --> 00:22:30,938
You were gonna tell me.
You said you were gonna help us find her killer.

323
00:22:31,049 --> 00:22:33,950
- I was gonna tell you what they shot her for.
- Uh-huh.

324
00:22:34,052 --> 00:22:35,747
The fortune in her basement.

325
00:22:35,854 --> 00:22:37,754
- They killed her for her fortune?
- That's right.

326
00:22:37,856 --> 00:22:39,517
- Did you see this guy?
- No.

327
00:22:39,624 --> 00:22:42,184
- I was in school.
- It was a school day.

328
00:22:42,294 --> 00:22:44,194
-Okay.
- Willie Sims.

329
00:22:44,296 --> 00:22:46,662
- Yeah, man, I remember you.
- We got him.

330
00:22:46,765 --> 00:22:48,756
I remember you.
You the talkin' man.

331
00:22:48,867 --> 00:22:50,494
Willie Sims. Yeah.
How are you?

332
00:22:50,602 --> 00:22:52,502
- As you see, man.
- Let's go.

333
00:22:52,604 --> 00:22:55,471
Look, what are they doing to me?
What do you want with me?

334
00:22:55,574 --> 00:22:57,872
- You missed it.
- What the hell do you want with me?

335
00:22:57,976 --> 00:23:01,036
- You missed it, Bob.
- Why are you harassin' me?

336
00:23:01,146 --> 00:23:04,115
Got him at the gym, just like you said.
What happened to you?

337
00:23:04,216 --> 00:23:06,650
Got pulled off the case.

338
00:23:07,552 --> 00:23:10,112
Bullshit you did.

339
00:23:12,457 --> 00:23:15,426
I'm stuck. I'm supposed to
babysit this candy store.

340
00:23:15,527 --> 00:23:19,429
Back on the corner, you were
saying something had already happened.

341
00:23:19,531 --> 00:23:22,557
- It's your case.
- I don't know. Yeah.

342
00:23:22,667 --> 00:23:27,036
Baby, we need you to turn this guy over.
We need the mouthpiece to sweet-talk his ass.

343
00:23:27,139 --> 00:23:28,504
- Lieu?
- Yes.

344
00:23:28,607 --> 00:23:32,202
- My father needs to talk to you.
- We'll take care ofit. Officer!

345
00:23:32,310 --> 00:23:34,210
- Yes, sir!
- My father needs you.

346
00:23:34,312 --> 00:23:36,246
- Would you see Miss Klein home?
- Yes, sir.

347
00:23:36,348 --> 00:23:39,408
- I assure you we'll take care of it.
- Ma'am?

348
00:23:39,518 --> 00:23:41,486
- I need to talk to you.
- One minute, please.

349
00:23:41,586 --> 00:23:44,077
Lieu, we're about to crack this Sims.

350
00:23:44,189 --> 00:23:48,091
I'm sorry, Bobby. I got a call. Downtown.
You live with this candy store.

351
00:23:48,193 --> 00:23:51,822
Bullshit aside, Lieu, we need him.
We're going in Mutt and Jeff and we need Bobby.

352
00:23:51,930 --> 00:23:54,831
- We need the Orator.
- I got the call. He's off the case.

353
00:23:54,933 --> 00:23:57,163
- What do you call this? Loyalty?
- Yes, boss?

354
00:23:57,269 --> 00:24:00,568
Come with me.
I'm sorry, Bobby. I got a call.

355
00:24:00,672 --> 00:24:03,505
Downtown, the Jewish guys,
they got this clout.

356
00:24:03,608 --> 00:24:08,068
The doctor wants you. You were there.
You're his people. You're on the case.

357
00:24:08,180 --> 00:24:10,080
I'm his people?

358
00:24:10,182 --> 00:24:12,173
I thought I was your people, Lieu.

359
00:24:12,284 --> 00:24:14,684
I come up with the idea,
trap the guy in.

360
00:24:14,786 --> 00:24:16,879
Lieu, I come up with the brother.
Hey-

361
00:24:16,988 --> 00:24:19,354
- I'm sorry, Bobby.
- Lieu, I'm in it from the get.

362
00:24:19,458 --> 00:24:22,689
I'm sorry. About the procedurals,
go ahead and clear them off your desk.

363
00:24:22,794 --> 00:24:24,694
You're sorry? What am I,
a fucking jumping bean?

364
00:24:24,796 --> 00:24:26,855
- I'm sorry.
- What, I'm your backup girl?

365
00:24:26,965 --> 00:24:29,365
I'm trying to follow orders, Lieu,
and I'm gettin' whiplash.

366
00:24:29,468 --> 00:24:32,369
Why don't you just send me to the airport?
What did I do to you?

367
00:24:32,471 --> 00:24:35,372
- It's nothing personal, Bobby.
- What I'm sayin', Lieu, perhaps it should be.

368
00:24:35,474 --> 00:24:38,375
Kid just gave up his brother.
Does not like police stations.

369
00:24:38,477 --> 00:24:40,707
-Just gave us Randolph.
- You got an address?

370
00:24:40,812 --> 00:24:42,712
Got the whole thing.
Let's go get 'im.

371
00:24:42,814 --> 00:24:44,714
- Yo, you want vests?
- Yeah.

372
00:24:44,816 --> 00:24:47,717
Where are you goin'?
You're on the candy store case.

373
00:24:47,819 --> 00:24:50,083
- He's on top ofit.
- The fuck he's on top ofit!

374
00:24:50,188 --> 00:24:52,088
- I'm going for coffee.
- Coffee? Bullshit!

375
00:24:52,190 --> 00:24:55,648
No! You wanna run on this other case,
it's my ass. You understand?

376
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,661
This guy is heavy downtown.
Don't lie to me.

377
00:24:58,763 --> 00:25:01,129
- The candy store. You got it.
- Lieu -

378
00:25:01,233 --> 00:25:04,259
Nothing you say or do can convince me,
so shut the fuck up.

379
00:25:04,369 --> 00:25:06,269
- It's not right.
- Get outta here!

380
00:25:06,371 --> 00:25:08,805
- Good-bye, Sully.
- That's right.

381
00:25:08,907 --> 00:25:12,638
- What do you got on the candy store case?
- Yeah, I'm on top ofit.

382
00:25:12,744 --> 00:25:15,645
- Tell me.
- Some kids say she kept a fortune
in her basement.

383
00:25:15,747 --> 00:25:17,647
- Yeah?
- I got the witnesses lined up.

384
00:25:17,749 --> 00:25:20,650
- Lieutenant, if I go back to the 212 -
- Yes. One moment.

385
00:25:20,752 --> 00:25:24,347
I'm sorry to pull you off the flash case, Bobby.
I appreciate what you're doing for me.

386
00:25:24,456 --> 00:25:26,356
- That's all right, Lieu.
- I got three calls.

387
00:25:26,458 --> 00:25:30,019
- The guy, Dr. Klein -You'll call him?
- I'm on it right now.

388
00:25:30,128 --> 00:25:32,028
- Thank you, Bob.
- It's all right, Lieu.

389
00:25:32,130 --> 00:25:35,327
- No, thank you. I'll make it up to you someday.
- It's all part of the job.

390
00:25:35,433 --> 00:25:36,695
That's right.

391
00:25:36,801 --> 00:25:39,269
- Yes? What?
- I'm sorry to keep going over this.

392
00:25:39,371 --> 00:25:42,670
That's okay.
We'll go over it from the jump.

393
00:25:49,548 --> 00:25:51,846
- Fuck him.
- Let's get out of here.

394
00:26:46,605 --> 00:26:49,904
- Lovely day for it.
- All right.

395
00:26:59,784 --> 00:27:02,685
Excuse me. I'm trying to find this address.
You know where that might be?

396
00:27:02,787 --> 00:27:04,379
This one right here?

397
00:28:12,357 --> 00:28:15,849
How come you always gotta be
the first one through the door?

398
00:28:17,629 --> 00:28:19,688
So brazen.

399
00:29:18,757 --> 00:29:21,851
You wanna kill my baby.

400
00:29:26,431 --> 00:29:29,093
You come here to kill my child.

401
00:29:29,200 --> 00:29:32,067
- I'm coming in, Bob.
- Yo, come in.

402
00:29:37,075 --> 00:29:39,168
This the broad?

403
00:29:40,378 --> 00:29:43,245
Joint's deserted.
Guy ain't here.

404
00:29:43,348 --> 00:29:45,578
Sullivan coming in!

405
00:29:55,760 --> 00:29:57,057
Where is he?

406
00:29:57,162 --> 00:30:00,029
I should kill my baby
that I brought into the world?

407
00:30:01,132 --> 00:30:04,590
White folks.
Why would that be?

408
00:30:04,702 --> 00:30:07,728
- Your baby's a murderer.
- He never hurt nobody.

409
00:30:07,839 --> 00:30:09,739
Now, that's just not the facts.

410
00:30:09,841 --> 00:30:14,107
He never hurt no one.
Now you got him out there runnin' for his life.

411
00:30:14,212 --> 00:30:18,273
We gotta get to him. We got a few days to do it.
We can bring him in.

412
00:30:18,383 --> 00:30:21,409
I mean, we don't find him,
we gotta call back in the F.B.I.

413
00:30:21,519 --> 00:30:23,419
F.B.I.'s gonna kill his ass.

414
00:30:23,521 --> 00:30:27,389
That's right. We're here to
cut you a deal that the federal boys won't.

415
00:30:27,492 --> 00:30:30,052
- So, what do you wanna do?
- Tell him what you wanna do.

416
00:30:30,161 --> 00:30:32,391
Get out of my motherfuckin' room.

417
00:30:32,497 --> 00:30:35,660
- Get out of my fuckin' room!
- Hey, bitch, you don't tell us.

418
00:30:35,767 --> 00:30:39,703
You don't tell us a goddamn thing!
We tell you!

419
00:30:39,804 --> 00:30:42,739
Your boy killed two cops. You think
we're just gonna sit here and chat with you?

420
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:45,469
We're wasting our time. Get her up.
Get her the fuck up!

421
00:30:45,577 --> 00:30:47,602
- Get her outta here!
- Give me a minute, will ya?

422
00:30:47,712 --> 00:30:51,307
- Two dead cops! What the fuck are you -

423
00:30:51,416 --> 00:30:53,543
- Give me a fuckin' minute!

424
00:30:53,651 --> 00:30:56,415
A minute is something
that we don't got.

425
00:30:56,521 --> 00:30:59,081
- Talkin' to a stone wall.
- Uh-huh.

426
00:30:59,190 --> 00:31:02,250
- You're wasting your time, Bob.
- I'll be the judge of that.

427
00:31:02,360 --> 00:31:04,590
- Why do you do this shit?
- Shut up!

428
00:31:07,232 --> 00:31:10,531
We got to find him.
Don't do this the hard way.

429
00:31:10,635 --> 00:31:13,536
Look at me.
Now, don't do this the hard way.

430
00:31:13,638 --> 00:31:15,538
- We can help you.
- Mmm.

431
00:31:15,640 --> 00:31:18,837
It's a bad beat and you're stuck in it,
and it's gonna be some crying.

432
00:31:18,943 --> 00:31:21,275
But our way is the easy way.

433
00:31:22,714 --> 00:31:24,773
Listen to me.

434
00:31:24,883 --> 00:31:26,851
We need your son...

435
00:31:28,219 --> 00:31:30,779
but we don't need him dead.

436
00:31:30,889 --> 00:31:34,120
You want him alive?
Work with us.

437
00:31:34,225 --> 00:31:36,125
We got to bring him in.

438
00:31:36,227 --> 00:31:39,287
- You want to kill him.
- We need to take him.

439
00:31:39,397 --> 00:31:42,628
But we need him alive.
That's the job we were given to do.

440
00:31:42,734 --> 00:31:45,635
That's why they gave it to the cops
'stead of the F.B.I.

441
00:31:45,737 --> 00:31:49,070
Our job is to bring him down alive.

442
00:31:49,173 --> 00:31:51,573
- That's what they sent us for.

443
00:31:51,676 --> 00:31:54,236
It's that simple.
That's what it is.

444
00:31:56,915 --> 00:31:59,645
Listen to me.

445
00:31:59,751 --> 00:32:01,651
I know that it stinks.

446
00:32:01,753 --> 00:32:05,154
I know that there's so much death in the world.
I know that it's full of hate, mama.

447
00:32:05,256 --> 00:32:08,316
I know that it all turns out wrong.

448
00:32:08,426 --> 00:32:10,394
Here we are.

449
00:32:11,696 --> 00:32:13,596
Here we are.

450
00:32:13,698 --> 00:32:15,598
We're the garbagemen.

451
00:32:15,700 --> 00:32:18,669
You think I don't know that?
I know that.

452
00:32:19,837 --> 00:32:22,067
Looking for something to love.

453
00:32:22,173 --> 00:32:25,734
You got something to love.
You got your boys.

454
00:32:25,843 --> 00:32:27,811
That's something.

455
00:32:29,580 --> 00:32:31,548
Look in my eyes.

456
00:32:33,284 --> 00:32:35,752
I want to save your son.

457
00:32:35,853 --> 00:32:38,253
Before God...

458
00:32:38,356 --> 00:32:40,847
I want to save your boy.

459
00:32:42,794 --> 00:32:44,762
Will you help me?

460
00:32:49,233 --> 00:32:51,201
- Uh, Bob?
- Not now.

461
00:32:51,302 --> 00:32:53,202
- The lieutenant.
- Not now.

462
00:32:53,304 --> 00:32:56,432
He needs you on the phone.
He says now.

463
00:33:01,813 --> 00:33:04,976
Time's running out.
Let's ride, mama.

464
00:33:05,083 --> 00:33:08,052
- What the fuck does he want?
- It's the Yids.

465
00:33:08,152 --> 00:33:10,245
- Blow 'em off.
- The doctor. Somebody took a shot at -

466
00:33:10,355 --> 00:33:13,324
- Somebody took a shot at -
- That's what they said.

467
00:33:15,193 --> 00:33:17,718
Bullshit. Bullshit!

468
00:33:22,000 --> 00:33:24,901
One of the men who was at
the medical examiner's office...

469
00:33:25,003 --> 00:33:28,097
assured me they will release it
before the end of the day.

470
00:33:32,343 --> 00:33:35,642
- What is it?
- They say a shot fired at them.

471
00:33:36,681 --> 00:33:38,649
Some guy on the roof.

472
00:33:40,518 --> 00:33:44,921
- A shot fired? Yes or no?
- I don't know. Didn't hit nothin' if it did.

473
00:33:45,023 --> 00:33:47,583
- Well, who heard it?
- The lady.

474
00:33:47,692 --> 00:33:51,594
The lady? What lady?
Get the lady in here so she can show me.

475
00:33:51,696 --> 00:33:54,164
- I'll show you.
- You'll show me what, sir?

476
00:33:54,265 --> 00:33:56,165
- Who made the call?
- I made the call.

477
00:33:56,267 --> 00:33:58,667
- What are we looking at? What's going on here?
- It happened here.

478
00:33:58,770 --> 00:34:01,762
What happened? Give me this number
right now. My partner- Get him.

479
00:34:01,873 --> 00:34:03,841
- There was a man on the roof.
- Uh-huh.

480
00:34:04,942 --> 00:34:06,842
- And my wife heard a shot.
- Uh-huh. She heard a shot.

481
00:34:06,944 --> 00:34:08,639
Yes, she did.

482
00:34:08,746 --> 00:34:12,773
Would she know what a shot sounds like?
How would she know that?

483
00:34:12,884 --> 00:34:16,183
- My wife heard a shot.
- There was a shot on the roof.

484
00:34:16,287 --> 00:34:18,812
There was a man on the roof.
A man on the roof.

485
00:34:18,923 --> 00:34:21,016
- Yes, ma'am.
- No, no, I'm not making it up.

486
00:34:21,125 --> 00:34:23,025
It happened.
There was shooting.

487
00:34:23,127 --> 00:34:25,994
- Ma'am, I don't know any reason why anyone -
- That's right.

488
00:34:26,097 --> 00:34:30,033
You don't, do you? But I see that you feel that,
what -you're dealing with hysterical Jews?

489
00:34:30,134 --> 00:34:32,034
I'm making it up.
Is that right?

490
00:34:32,136 --> 00:34:34,570
We're always making it up.
Is that right?

491
00:34:34,672 --> 00:34:37,300
It's all right, dear.
Let me tell you one thing.

492
00:34:37,408 --> 00:34:41,401
- There was a man on the roof.
- Look, can I talk to you for a second?

493
00:34:44,916 --> 00:34:48,477
Look, Doctor, why would anybody
be shooting at you?

494
00:34:48,586 --> 00:34:51,487
- You follow me?
- Do I follow you?

495
00:34:51,589 --> 00:34:55,150
Look, you - You're under
a lot of stress today-your tragedy.

496
00:34:55,259 --> 00:34:57,921
I'm sorry for you,
what happened to your mother.

497
00:34:58,029 --> 00:35:02,728
I'm gonna station a man on the roof.
You keep away from this side of the house. Okay?

498
00:35:02,834 --> 00:35:05,029
It's always a fantasy, isn't it?

499
00:35:05,136 --> 00:35:07,832
A fantasy? What's a fantasy?
I don't get you.

500
00:35:07,939 --> 00:35:09,930
When someone wants to hurt the Jews.

501
00:35:10,041 --> 00:35:12,601
I've got nothing against theJews, Doctor.
I'm a Jew.

502
00:35:12,710 --> 00:35:16,908
And I'll tell you something else -
When the fantasy is true, when we've been killed...

503
00:35:17,014 --> 00:35:21,417
then you say, ''What a coincidence that
at the same time we were being paranoid...

504
00:35:21,519 --> 00:35:23,612
someone was coincidentally
trying to hurt us.''

505
00:35:23,721 --> 00:35:26,622
What can I have
against the Jewish people, Doctor?

506
00:35:26,724 --> 00:35:28,954
I'm sorry what happened
to your mother.

507
00:35:29,060 --> 00:35:32,223
You say you saw someone on the roof.
I'm putting a man there.

508
00:35:32,330 --> 00:35:35,231
You tell me what more
you think that I can do. All right?

509
00:35:35,333 --> 00:35:38,029
I'm just trying to do my job.
I'm sorry.

510
00:35:38,136 --> 00:35:42,766
You're trying to do your job?
Let's be frank, shall we? Can we do that?

511
00:35:42,874 --> 00:35:44,899
- Sir, do you want to be frank?
- Yes, I do.

512
00:35:45,009 --> 00:35:47,944
- I don't get the whole fuckin' thing.
- It amounts to this. My mother was killed.

513
00:35:48,045 --> 00:35:52,448
You're assigned to the case. I called downtown.
They say you're a good detective.

514
00:35:52,550 --> 00:35:55,451
I want you to find her murderer,
and I want protection.

515
00:35:55,553 --> 00:35:58,454
I know you think this is a bullshit case.
I don't care.

516
00:35:58,556 --> 00:36:01,457
You're paid to do ajob.
Do your fucking job.

517
00:36:01,559 --> 00:36:04,926
- Have you got the pride for that?
- Don't get in my face, man.

518
00:36:05,029 --> 00:36:08,192
Have you got the pride to do
the job you were given?

519
00:36:08,299 --> 00:36:10,199
Do your job, or else.

520
00:36:10,301 --> 00:36:13,532
Don't tell me ''or else.'' Don't tell me ''or else.''
I'm gonna do the job.

521
00:36:13,638 --> 00:36:17,074
I'm not scared of your money, I'm not scared of you,
and I don't need your threats.

522
00:36:17,175 --> 00:36:20,633
- I'm here to do the job!
- Excuse me.

523
00:36:21,646 --> 00:36:23,944
Excuse me.
There was a disturbance.

524
00:36:24,048 --> 00:36:26,175
It's nothing.
It's nothing to be alarmed at.

525
00:36:37,195 --> 00:36:40,164
- My partner?
- Got to him. He says don't move.

526
00:36:40,264 --> 00:36:43,165
He's getting back to you this number,
10, 15 minutes.

527
00:36:43,267 --> 00:36:44,666
Okay, thanks.

528
00:36:44,769 --> 00:36:48,671
- Oh, sweetie, I'm so sorry about your grandma.
- Thank you so much for coming.

529
00:36:48,773 --> 00:36:50,673
- Mama, I have to talk to you.
- Yes, darling.

530
00:36:50,775 --> 00:36:52,504
Dear, go ahead.

531
00:37:17,001 --> 00:37:19,060
Where is the photograph?

532
00:37:46,364 --> 00:37:49,959
What's he saying?
Do you speak Hebrew?

533
00:37:50,067 --> 00:37:52,194
It's not Hebrew.

534
00:37:52,303 --> 00:37:54,328
He's speaking Yiddish.

535
00:37:54,438 --> 00:37:57,339
- He's -

536
00:37:57,441 --> 00:38:01,172
He says the years they spent
working together...

537
00:38:01,279 --> 00:38:03,839
his time with her and with -

538
00:38:03,948 --> 00:38:06,109
and with her husband...

539
00:38:06,217 --> 00:38:10,176
were the closest ties he ever had
with any living being.

540
00:38:13,157 --> 00:38:15,216
He calls her a great woman.

541
00:38:16,360 --> 00:38:18,658
He's praising her courage...

542
00:38:18,763 --> 00:38:22,199
in the years before the formation
of the state of Israel...

543
00:38:23,534 --> 00:38:26,503
and he's talking about when they-

544
00:38:31,909 --> 00:38:33,809
When they what?

545
00:38:33,911 --> 00:38:36,436
- It's -

546
00:38:36,547 --> 00:38:41,211
You know, it's jargon language Yiddish.
I-I-I don't speak Yiddish that well.

547
00:38:49,994 --> 00:38:52,622
Detective, you're wanted
on the phone in the study.

548
00:39:00,371 --> 00:39:02,271
- Thanks.
- You need anything else?

549
00:39:02,373 --> 00:39:05,274
No, no, just, uh, hang tight.
And shut the door, will ya?

550
00:39:08,813 --> 00:39:10,747
Detective Gold.

551
00:39:10,848 --> 00:39:14,614
Tim! She -The old lady.
She gonna give him up?

552
00:39:14,719 --> 00:39:18,712
She gonna give him up? You got her?
You worked her around. Fantastic!

553
00:39:18,823 --> 00:39:21,724
Oh, fuck me!
Why do I always miss it?

554
00:39:21,826 --> 00:39:23,623
She said what?

555
00:39:23,728 --> 00:39:26,322
Oh, yeah, I'm the linchpin.
Big deal.

556
00:39:26,430 --> 00:39:29,297
Oh, man. Was it sweet?

557
00:39:29,400 --> 00:39:32,494
I would have been there.
I'm stuck here with my- my Jews.

558
00:39:32,603 --> 00:39:35,163
You should see this fuckin' room.

559
00:39:35,272 --> 00:39:36,967
No, fuckin' bullshit.

560
00:39:37,074 --> 00:39:41,568
Bunch of high-strung fuckin' bullshit.
They pay so much taxes - Fuck 'em.

561
00:39:43,280 --> 00:39:45,510
Yo! She did?

562
00:39:45,616 --> 00:39:47,846
Fan-fuckin'-tastic!

563
00:39:48,986 --> 00:39:52,422
What? Oh, some bullshit.
Somebody's taking shots at 'em.

564
00:39:52,523 --> 00:39:54,423
Hey, fuck 'em.
Don't tell me.

565
00:39:54,525 --> 00:39:58,256
Don't send the old ladywork down there
and tell me how you're so surprised.

566
00:39:58,362 --> 00:40:00,830
Fuck 'em and the taxes they pay.

567
00:40:00,931 --> 00:40:04,992
You tell me. Ten more bucks a week they're makin',
lettin' her work down there?

568
00:40:05,102 --> 00:40:08,503
Ha! Hey, not my people, baby.
Fuck 'em.

569
00:40:08,606 --> 00:40:11,507
There's so much anti-Semitism
the last 4,000 years...

570
00:40:11,609 --> 00:40:14,134
we must be doin' somethin'
bring it about.

571
00:40:14,245 --> 00:40:16,406
I'll see you at the house half an hour.

572
00:40:16,514 --> 00:40:18,812
Yo, Tim. See you then.

573
00:40:34,698 --> 00:40:37,258
My grandmother was killed today.

574
00:40:37,368 --> 00:40:40,269
She stayed down there
because she wanted to stay there.

575
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:43,499
She was a fighter.
She wanted to die there.

576
00:40:44,975 --> 00:40:46,602
She died there.

577
00:40:50,714 --> 00:40:54,013
You're a Jew, and you talk that way
in the house of the dead.

578
00:40:54,118 --> 00:40:57,576
- Do you have any shame?
- I'm sorry about your grandmother.

579
00:40:57,688 --> 00:40:59,588
No one asked you to be sorry.

580
00:40:59,690 --> 00:41:02,090
No one asked for your sympathy.

581
00:41:02,193 --> 00:41:04,753
We would have appreciated your respect.

582
00:41:09,200 --> 00:41:11,600
Do you hate yourself that much?

583
00:41:13,103 --> 00:41:15,367
Do you belong nowhere?

584
00:41:20,377 --> 00:41:23,244
I - I'll find the killer. I -

585
00:41:23,347 --> 00:41:26,248
I swear I'll find the killer.

586
00:41:26,350 --> 00:41:28,409
I swear. Listen to me.
Please! I'll-

587
00:41:42,733 --> 00:41:44,724
It was a backfire.

588
00:41:48,672 --> 00:41:50,902
What do you think?

589
00:41:51,942 --> 00:41:55,105
I think it was a car backfiring.

590
00:41:56,747 --> 00:41:59,307
How do I get to their roof?

591
00:41:59,416 --> 00:42:02,180
Through the kitchen.
You want backup?

592
00:42:02,286 --> 00:42:04,550
No. Keep 'em out of here.

593
00:42:47,431 --> 00:42:49,456
Hey!

594
00:42:49,567 --> 00:42:50,864
Hey!

595
00:45:24,555 --> 00:45:27,115
No, I, uh, think everything
is all right now.

596
00:45:27,224 --> 00:45:29,124
We've got men all over.
Everything is fine.

597
00:45:29,226 --> 00:45:31,126
There was someone on the roof.

598
00:45:31,228 --> 00:45:33,196
- It's all my fault.
- This is terrible.

599
00:45:47,611 --> 00:45:49,203
Excuse me.

600
00:45:49,313 --> 00:45:52,680
Can you think of anyone
who would want to harm them?

601
00:45:52,783 --> 00:45:56,150
- Did they have any enemies?
- No.

602
00:45:57,755 --> 00:46:01,589
They have a lot of money.
What was the old lady doing working down there?

603
00:46:01,692 --> 00:46:05,321
- I don't want to talk about the family.
-Just tell me that.

604
00:46:05,429 --> 00:46:09,729
Sh - She... made the money down there,
put the kids through school.

605
00:46:09,833 --> 00:46:11,994
She wanted to stay there.

606
00:46:12,102 --> 00:46:14,093
She used to work in Palestine?

607
00:46:14,204 --> 00:46:15,831
That's right.

608
00:46:16,974 --> 00:46:18,942
Excuse me.

609
00:47:19,303 --> 00:47:21,863
- Detective?
- Yeah. How are ya?

610
00:47:21,972 --> 00:47:23,997
Fine, thanks.

611
00:47:24,107 --> 00:47:27,133
Always coldest just before the dawn.

612
00:47:27,244 --> 00:47:29,235
Yes, I remember that.

613
00:47:33,517 --> 00:47:35,485
You going in?

614
00:47:37,855 --> 00:47:39,482
Yeah.

615
00:47:51,535 --> 00:47:53,503
Where are the lights?

616
00:48:02,079 --> 00:48:04,877
Some valuable stuff down in the cellar?

617
00:48:04,982 --> 00:48:07,610
Hey, that's just something they said.

618
00:48:09,887 --> 00:48:12,788
Something the kids been sayin'
anound here for years.

619
00:48:12,890 --> 00:48:15,290
See for yourself.
Nothin' down there.

620
00:48:15,392 --> 00:48:17,292
- Hmm.
- Dust on the stairs.

621
00:48:17,394 --> 00:48:20,795
- Ain't nobody been down there in years.
- Uh-huh.

622
00:48:20,898 --> 00:48:23,890
They say she kept a piece
behind the counter.

623
00:48:24,001 --> 00:48:28,904
But what is that gonna do,
some guy comes in with a shotgun?

624
00:48:29,006 --> 00:48:31,907
And how are you gonna be
watchin' the door all day?

625
00:48:32,009 --> 00:48:33,909
- Uh-huh.
- Every day, huh?

626
00:48:34,011 --> 00:48:36,707
You can't do it.

627
00:48:36,813 --> 00:48:41,273
So I say I'm gonna be in here someday,
she gets popped.

628
00:48:41,385 --> 00:48:45,754
And it was just a question of when,
no more, no less.

629
00:48:46,790 --> 00:48:48,348
Tell you somethin' else.

630
00:48:48,458 --> 00:48:51,359
I don't know that her coming here
does not make violence.

631
00:48:51,461 --> 00:48:55,158
Rich Jew lady in this neighborhood
is gon' get took off.

632
00:48:55,265 --> 00:48:57,165
Human nature.

633
00:48:57,267 --> 00:49:01,431
Someday somebody gonna
come in here, see what it is.

634
00:49:02,472 --> 00:49:04,372
You okay down there?

635
00:49:04,474 --> 00:49:06,101
Yeah, I'm fine.

636
00:49:51,188 --> 00:49:54,089
You all right down there, Detective?

637
00:49:54,191 --> 00:49:55,818
Mm-hmm.

638
00:50:01,264 --> 00:50:05,564
''Hauser. Greenblatts. Samson.

639
00:50:05,669 --> 00:50:09,264
Greenwald. Klein. Gross.''

640
00:50:28,358 --> 00:50:30,258
Good morning.

641
00:50:30,360 --> 00:50:32,920
Get this to the A.T.F., will you?

642
00:50:33,030 --> 00:50:35,089
Good morning.
And make me copies.

643
00:50:35,198 --> 00:50:39,259
An invoice -
20 Thompson machine guns from 1946...

644
00:50:39,369 --> 00:50:41,269
and a list of names.

645
00:50:41,371 --> 00:50:45,239
And please, run this
through the computer-

646
00:50:46,810 --> 00:50:48,175
''Grofaz.''

647
00:50:48,278 --> 00:50:51,543
- Grofaz?
- G-R-O-F-A-Z.

648
00:50:51,648 --> 00:50:53,548
What is it, a name?

649
00:50:53,650 --> 00:50:56,414
- I don't know what it is.
- All right.

650
00:50:56,520 --> 00:50:58,488
Have a good day.

651
00:51:01,425 --> 00:51:04,155
Get up, Mr. Wells.
I'm taking you in for arraignment.

652
00:51:04,261 --> 00:51:05,956
- Detective.
- Yeah.

653
00:51:06,063 --> 00:51:08,691
- I need you to file a complaint on this man.
- Complaint?

654
00:51:08,799 --> 00:51:11,029
- He assaulted you.
- Forget it.

655
00:51:11,134 --> 00:51:13,125
Assault police officer,
attempted escape.

656
00:51:13,236 --> 00:51:15,431
Yeah, forget it.
Fuckin' guy shot his wife and kids.

657
00:51:15,539 --> 00:51:17,666
What are they gonna do to him
for beating on me?

658
00:51:17,774 --> 00:51:20,937
Sir, the thing is you need to make an example
of this guy hittin' on a cop.

659
00:51:21,044 --> 00:51:23,604
Hey, leave it, all right?

660
00:51:23,713 --> 00:51:25,613
I won't forget this, Officer.
Thank you.

661
00:51:26,650 --> 00:51:28,550
I'll make it up to you. I promise.

662
00:51:28,652 --> 00:51:31,815
- You're gonna make it up to me?
- Yes, I will.

663
00:51:32,856 --> 00:51:35,017
Your kindness has changed my life.

664
00:51:35,125 --> 00:51:37,559
Well, that's swell.

665
00:51:37,661 --> 00:51:40,061
And someday, I'll repay you.

666
00:51:41,164 --> 00:51:43,257
Uh-huh.

667
00:51:43,366 --> 00:51:46,529
My thoughts are elsewhere.
You must pardon me.

668
00:51:50,807 --> 00:51:56,040
Yeah. Grofaz. G-R-O-F-A-Z.

669
00:51:56,146 --> 00:51:58,046
- Hi.
- How you doing, Billy?

670
00:51:58,148 --> 00:52:00,639
Okay. You all alone here today?

671
00:52:00,750 --> 00:52:02,684
Yeah, I'm never going home.
Here. Keep it.

672
00:52:02,786 --> 00:52:05,983
- Thanks.
- Anything you might have.

673
00:52:06,089 --> 00:52:10,526
Particularly anything connected
with anti-Jewish acts.

674
00:52:10,627 --> 00:52:12,788
Well, if you do,
will you please call me here?

675
00:52:12,896 --> 00:52:14,887
Thank you.

676
00:52:14,998 --> 00:52:17,262
That's him. That's the man.

677
00:52:17,367 --> 00:52:19,198
- What's happening, Brown?
- That's him. You're the one.

678
00:52:19,302 --> 00:52:21,293
I'm gonna do it,
but I'm gonna do it with you.

679
00:52:21,404 --> 00:52:23,770
You're gonna take him in like you told me,
nice and gentle.

680
00:52:23,874 --> 00:52:26,399
- No harm will come to him.
- No harm will come to him.

681
00:52:26,510 --> 00:52:29,206
- You swore that.
- Well, you won her a round, my man.

682
00:52:29,312 --> 00:52:32,770
- I did?
- You said the magic word. The duck came down.

683
00:52:32,883 --> 00:52:35,818
5:00 a.m., Randolph meets his mother.

684
00:52:35,919 --> 00:52:39,912
Here's the setup: She's gonna tell him she's gonna
get him out of the country, get him a ticket.

685
00:52:40,023 --> 00:52:42,583
-Jilly, you want to come in here?
- Hold it a minute, Frank.

686
00:52:42,692 --> 00:52:46,321
We have her tell Randolph she's gonna
get the passport of a friend of his.

687
00:52:46,429 --> 00:52:49,887
So Randolph thinks he's gonna take
the passport, go to South America.

688
00:52:50,000 --> 00:52:53,731
- We have his mom set up a date with him.
-Jilly, I gotta work on this thing here.

689
00:52:53,837 --> 00:52:56,965
No, Bob.
The broad won't show unless you're there.

690
00:52:57,073 --> 00:52:58,904
You're the man gonna bring him in.

691
00:52:59,009 --> 00:53:01,341
- 5.:00a.m. tomorrow.
- I gotta work on this thing.

692
00:53:01,444 --> 00:53:03,139
- Put it on the shelf.
- I can't.

693
00:53:03,246 --> 00:53:06,215
You've got to.
We're taking Randolph 5:00 a.m. tomorrow.

694
00:53:06,316 --> 00:53:09,217
You're gonna be there.
Get over to passport office right now.

695
00:53:09,319 --> 00:53:11,913
Sully's waiting for 'em.
Give 'em those pictures.

696
00:53:12,022 --> 00:53:14,422
- Hey, this is the big one, Bob.
- Jilly!

697
00:53:14,524 --> 00:53:18,187
Comin', Frank.
Get over to passport office right now.

698
00:53:20,630 --> 00:53:24,066
This rendezvous with Randolph
takes place at 5.:00a.m....

699
00:53:24,167 --> 00:53:27,659
at, uh - at Third and, uh -

700
00:53:28,872 --> 00:53:30,840
Bob?

701
00:53:31,875 --> 00:53:33,775
- I was out all night on this.
- Uh-huh.

702
00:53:33,877 --> 00:53:38,143
What do you make of it?
I got a picture of this woman, taken in Wisconsin.

703
00:53:38,248 --> 00:53:41,684
Nice old Jewish woman with a tommy gun.
All right?

704
00:53:42,852 --> 00:53:46,379
What is she doing with an invoice
for these tommy guns in the basement?

705
00:53:47,424 --> 00:53:50,882
I got, um - Last night.

706
00:53:50,994 --> 00:53:53,224
I got Israeli heavy hitters coming in.

707
00:53:53,330 --> 00:53:55,230
I got some guy on the roof.

708
00:53:55,332 --> 00:53:57,960
- Yeah, well, it's a mystery, isn't it?
- Look.

709
00:53:58,068 --> 00:54:00,662
- This was taken in Wisconsin, 1946.
- Bob.

710
00:54:00,770 --> 00:54:04,001
Bob. Hey, Bob. Hey.
Get out of it.

711
00:54:04,107 --> 00:54:07,736
We got a job to do.
Tonight the balloon goes up.

712
00:54:07,844 --> 00:54:10,074
The old days, Bobby, huh?
You bust a case...

713
00:54:10,180 --> 00:54:13,377
bottle comes out, stick your feet up
on the filing cabinet, eh?

714
00:54:13,483 --> 00:54:15,815
We lure Randolph out, we take him in.

715
00:54:15,919 --> 00:54:17,819
Third and Racine. You got it?

716
00:54:17,921 --> 00:54:20,412
- This other case -
- Fuck the other case.

717
00:54:20,523 --> 00:54:22,991
What other case?
What other case?

718
00:54:23,093 --> 00:54:27,587
- This Jewish -
- It's a candy store pop. Just look busy on it.

719
00:54:27,697 --> 00:54:31,565
I -Well, you know, I caught the case.

720
00:54:31,668 --> 00:54:34,535
What i -
What is there, a broad in it?

721
00:54:34,638 --> 00:54:38,096
Hmm? What's the thing?

722
00:54:38,208 --> 00:54:42,668
It's just - I think it's some -
some sort of conspiracy.

723
00:54:42,779 --> 00:54:46,340
- Some sort of conspiracy.
- They said somebody was shooting at them.

724
00:54:46,449 --> 00:54:48,349
Someone was shooting at them.
The Jew family?

725
00:54:48,451 --> 00:54:51,784
- Yes.
- Was there someone shooting at them?

726
00:54:52,922 --> 00:54:54,981
Hmm? Bob?

727
00:54:55,091 --> 00:54:57,116
Hmm?

728
00:54:58,395 --> 00:55:00,022
Hey.

729
00:55:00,130 --> 00:55:03,827
You got some -You got some
heavy troubles on your mind?

730
00:55:03,933 --> 00:55:06,333
Huh? Babe? We'll work it out.

731
00:55:06,436 --> 00:55:09,997
We'll play some cops and robbers.
We'll bust this big criminal.

732
00:55:10,106 --> 00:55:12,370
We'll swagger around.

733
00:55:16,079 --> 00:55:19,515
- You're like my family, Tim.
- Bob, I am your family.

734
00:55:19,616 --> 00:55:22,244
Here you go.

735
00:55:22,352 --> 00:55:24,582
One passport show-and-tell.

736
00:55:24,688 --> 00:55:28,385
I'll require your signature on these documents.
These also require your star number.

737
00:55:28,491 --> 00:55:32,825
May I see it, please? Please fill in
only those sections marked as required.

738
00:55:32,929 --> 00:55:35,397
This is a release form.
Please read it.

739
00:55:35,498 --> 00:55:37,830

00:55:37,934 --> 00:55:40,664

744
00:55:48,345 --> 00:55:51,644
Misuse or malfeasance in regard

745
00:55:51,748 --> 00:55:55,343
- I'm sorry. You can't smoke in here. Now -
- I'll see you in the hall.

746
00:55:55,452 --> 00:55:56,976
We have the G22A -

747
00:56:20,110 --> 00:56:22,340
- Yeah, I'll file the form
and see you tomorrow morning.
- Okay.

748
00:56:22,445 --> 00:56:25,243
- Thanks a lot, Al.
- Sure thing.
You going up to the country this weekend?

749
00:56:25,348 --> 00:56:27,316
No, we're staying in town.
I'll see you later.

750
00:56:28,585 --> 00:56:30,815
What are you gonna do?
Write away to the manufacturer?

751
00:56:30,920 --> 00:56:32,820
- I rebel -
-Jerry.

752
00:56:32,922 --> 00:56:35,288
Wait a second.
I rebel every time somebody says to me -

753
00:56:35,392 --> 00:56:37,383
- Excuse me.
- ''This is the thing of the future. ''

754
00:56:37,494 --> 00:56:39,428
If something works, why-

755
00:56:39,529 --> 00:56:41,463
I just saw the A.T.F.
They were stolen, Sully.

756
00:56:41,564 --> 00:56:43,794
The tommy guns were stolen.
All the guns on this invoice.

757
00:56:43,900 --> 00:56:45,800
Hey. You're better than an aquarium,
you know that?

758
00:56:45,902 --> 00:56:48,200
- There's something happening
with you every minute.
- What does it mean?

759
00:56:48,304 --> 00:56:51,535
It don't mean nothing. Some broad got killed.
She's dead now. Okay?

760
00:56:51,641 --> 00:56:54,041
You're going to the ticket office,
pick up Randolph's tickets.

761
00:56:54,144 --> 00:56:56,203
- This is the big one, laddie.
- Timmy, this other case.

762
00:56:56,312 --> 00:56:58,803
- Bob.
- I got this piece ofpaper I found. ''Grofaz.''

763
00:56:58,915 --> 00:57:00,815
''Grofaz.'' What does it mean?

764
00:57:00,917 --> 00:57:04,284
I don't know what it means.
I got this fella on the roof- the Jewish house. I -

765
00:57:04,387 --> 00:57:06,412
- What was he doing? Shooting at 'em?
- I don't know.

766
00:57:06,523 --> 00:57:08,753
Well, then drop it, Bobby.
For Christ's sake.

767
00:57:08,858 --> 00:57:10,826
I don't get it.

768
00:57:12,061 --> 00:57:14,723
- Maybe you don't want to get it.
- What do you mean?

769
00:57:14,831 --> 00:57:17,197
- Nothin'.
- What do you mean? 'Cause I ain't a Yid?

770
00:57:17,300 --> 00:57:19,495
- Well, you ain't a Yid.
- And so what?

771
00:57:19,602 --> 00:57:22,002
I'm - I'm an anti-Semite?
What the fuck are you sayin'?

772
00:57:22,105 --> 00:57:25,871
It's just not your thing, Tim.
It's not your thing. It's my thing, okay?

773
00:57:25,975 --> 00:57:30,776
Bob, I'm gonna tell you what the old whore said,
and this is the truest thing I know.

774
00:57:30,880 --> 00:57:34,316
''When you start comin' with the customers,
it's time to quit.''

775
00:57:35,385 --> 00:57:38,411
- What is this?
- That's the strap the guy tore off my holster.

776
00:57:38,521 --> 00:57:43,424
Well, go get it fixed, will ya?
Go take a cooling walk- somethin'.

777
00:57:43,526 --> 00:57:46,222
- You mad at me?
- Yeah, I'm mad at you.

778
00:57:46,329 --> 00:57:48,388
I'm not gonna invite you to my birthday party.

779
00:57:48,498 --> 00:57:50,398
- You dumb kike.

780
00:57:50,500 --> 00:57:52,468
Go get your holster fixed.

781
00:58:02,512 --> 00:58:05,504
- Excuse me.
- We're closed.

782
00:58:05,615 --> 00:58:08,607
Well, I, uh, wonder, could you help me?

783
00:58:09,853 --> 00:58:13,949
- We're closed. We're closing up.
- Well, I just need, um - I got a little problem.

784
00:58:14,057 --> 00:58:18,494
I'm a police officer.
I lost the strap off my holster.

785
00:58:18,595 --> 00:58:22,827
- I can't help it. We're closing up. I'm sorry.

786
00:58:25,034 --> 00:58:26,934
You're a policeman?

787
00:58:27,036 --> 00:58:28,469
Yes.

788
00:58:29,639 --> 00:58:31,971
Show it to me.

789
00:58:43,686 --> 00:58:45,916
- What is it?
- A word.

790
00:58:46,022 --> 00:58:49,514
A word?
You know what the word means?

791
00:58:52,128 --> 00:58:55,723
Yes. I know what it means.

792
00:58:59,369 --> 00:59:01,269
It means ''Hitler.''

793
00:59:03,072 --> 00:59:05,540
It was another name they had for Hitler.

794
00:59:14,817 --> 00:59:20,187
''Grosster Feldherr Aller Zeiten. ''

795
00:59:21,558 --> 00:59:25,392
''The greatest strategist...

796
00:59:25,495 --> 00:59:27,463
of all time.''

797
00:59:29,332 --> 00:59:31,300
The Grofaz.

798
00:59:32,735 --> 00:59:34,202
Hitler.

799
00:59:44,180 --> 00:59:46,842
- Are you all right?
- What?

800
00:59:46,950 --> 00:59:50,181
No, I, uh, just didn't get much sleep last night.

801
00:59:52,655 --> 00:59:55,055
You know,
you have a very interesting request.

802
00:59:58,127 --> 01:00:00,789
The acronym is not well-known.

803
01:00:00,897 --> 01:00:02,922
It was used at the end of the war.

804
01:00:03,032 --> 01:00:07,230
The name is obviously the effort
of their Propaganda Ministry.

805
01:00:07,337 --> 01:00:11,467
It was an interesting attempt,
but it didn't particularly take.

806
01:00:11,574 --> 01:00:14,441
It was used by a group -

807
01:00:15,778 --> 01:00:18,679
the Sonderkommando.

808
01:00:18,781 --> 01:00:23,309
It was adopted by
the Sonder Endlosung Kommando...

809
01:00:23,419 --> 01:00:26,752
of the division Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler.

810
01:00:26,856 --> 01:00:29,120
That is, the special group
for the final solution...

811
01:00:29,225 --> 01:00:33,184
which is, of course,
the extermination of the Jews.

812
01:00:33,296 --> 01:00:35,628
''German people, follow the Grofaz.''

813
01:00:35,732 --> 01:00:39,429
''The Leibstandarte Adolf Hitler
fights on all fronts for the salvation of Germany.

814
01:00:39,535 --> 01:00:41,799
TheJewish scourge
can be cleansed only in blood.''

815
01:00:41,904 --> 01:00:43,804
Uh, this is a very rare piece.

816
01:00:43,906 --> 01:00:46,807
What do you have on the use of this word?
Currently.

817
01:00:46,909 --> 01:00:50,072
Particularly in conjunction with
anti-Semitic acts.

818
01:00:50,179 --> 01:00:53,979
As I said, it's an arcane usage, but we'll look.

819
01:00:54,083 --> 01:00:56,051
We'll take a look.

820
01:00:56,152 --> 01:00:58,313
Ann?

821
01:00:58,421 --> 01:01:02,448
Current anti-Semitism under ''Grofaz,''
cross-reference ''Der Fuhrer.'' Bring it all.

822
01:01:02,558 --> 01:01:04,526
Yes.

823
01:01:06,162 --> 01:01:08,130
If you'd care to wait.

824
01:01:34,991 --> 01:01:36,982
I'm a police officer.

825
01:01:43,066 --> 01:01:45,000
The revolver disturbs you.

826
01:01:46,035 --> 01:01:48,265
The gun disturbs you. I'm a police officer.

827
01:01:48,371 --> 01:01:50,703
The gun doesn't disturb me.

828
01:01:50,807 --> 01:01:54,299
- You were looking at me.
- The gun is nothing. The gun is a tool.

829
01:01:54,410 --> 01:01:58,005
We have nothing to fear from a tool.
The badge concerns me.

830
01:01:58,114 --> 01:02:01,277
The badge, you see -
The badge is a symbol.

831
01:02:01,384 --> 01:02:06,515
The badge is the symbol
of that which constrains us.

832
01:02:06,622 --> 01:02:10,991
The star, you see -The star.
The five-pointed star.

833
01:02:11,094 --> 01:02:13,187
The pentagram.

834
01:02:13,296 --> 01:02:15,457
It is identified as a star...

835
01:02:15,565 --> 01:02:17,465
but it is not the symbol of heaven.

836
01:02:17,567 --> 01:02:19,467
It is the symbol of Earth.

837
01:02:19,569 --> 01:02:24,597
The Magen David is the intersection
of the opposites...

838
01:02:24,707 --> 01:02:28,700
and can be deconstructed
into heaven and Earth.

839
01:02:28,811 --> 01:02:31,371
But the pentagram cannot be deconstructed.

840
01:02:31,481 --> 01:02:32,846
You see?

841
01:02:32,949 --> 01:02:35,679
The five points are the five senses.

842
01:02:35,785 --> 01:02:39,881
The Chinese five elements.
The five fingers of the hand.

843
01:02:39,989 --> 01:02:41,889
You see?

844
01:02:41,991 --> 01:02:43,720
You're Jewish?

845
01:02:44,827 --> 01:02:46,795
Are you Jewish?

846
01:02:48,030 --> 01:02:50,863
- Yes.
- Well -

847
01:02:50,967 --> 01:02:52,901
You see?

848
01:02:53,002 --> 01:02:55,436
From the book of Esther.

849
01:02:55,538 --> 01:02:59,201
Esther. From ''satan'' - ''to conceal. ''

850
01:02:59,308 --> 01:03:01,503
But what is concealed?

851
01:03:01,611 --> 01:03:04,944
What is concealed in the name Esther?

852
01:03:05,047 --> 01:03:07,072
And the answer is here.

853
01:03:07,183 --> 01:03:09,811
Here is the answer. Do you see?

854
01:03:11,187 --> 01:03:13,018
I can't read it.

855
01:03:13,122 --> 01:03:15,955
You say you're a Jew.

856
01:03:16,058 --> 01:03:17,457
I can't read it.

857
01:03:21,798 --> 01:03:25,825
You say you're a Jew,
and you can't read Hebrew.

858
01:03:30,406 --> 01:03:32,306
What are you then?

859
01:03:38,281 --> 01:03:40,249
Would you get that book for me?

860
01:03:47,757 --> 01:03:50,487
Would you replace it for me, please?

861
01:03:50,593 --> 01:03:52,823
It goes up there.

862
01:04:02,071 --> 01:04:04,062
The material on anti-Semitic acts -

863
01:04:04,173 --> 01:04:06,505
Yes. I thought we had quite a file of current -

864
01:04:06,609 --> 01:04:09,100
It was requested by 212.

865
01:04:09,212 --> 01:04:11,840
- 212 wants it?
- Yes.

866
01:04:11,948 --> 01:04:15,179
Loaned to 212 now?
Fine. Then just pull the file.

867
01:04:16,385 --> 01:04:18,353
Okay. Thanks.

868
01:04:27,563 --> 01:04:29,895
The material on anti-Semitic acts.

869
01:04:29,999 --> 01:04:31,933
- No, we have nothing on that.
- Nothing?

870
01:04:32,034 --> 01:04:34,468
- No.
- This is official police business.

871
01:04:34,570 --> 01:04:39,303
Officer, you know I'd help you i-if I could,
but as I said, it was rather arcane material.

872
01:04:39,408 --> 01:04:40,966
I'm sorry.

873
01:04:41,077 --> 01:04:44,513
Well, if there's nothing you can do,
there's nothing you can do. Thank you.

874
01:04:44,614 --> 01:04:48,050
Not at all. If there's anything else
I can help you with, let me know.

875
01:06:00,589 --> 01:06:02,614
We could put the couch on the other side.

876
01:06:02,725 --> 01:06:05,193
- Bookshelf would be nice,
but I thought it would be -

877
01:06:08,998 --> 01:06:10,898
I, um -

878
01:06:11,000 --> 01:06:13,798
Can you tell me anything about this building?

879
01:06:13,903 --> 01:06:17,270
- What?
- Do you know anything about this building?

880
01:06:17,373 --> 01:06:19,273
- I just, um -
- About this building?

881
01:06:19,375 --> 01:06:21,570
- Yes.
- Do you live around here?

882
01:06:21,677 --> 01:06:24,441
- Please, just tell me.
Have you ever seen anyone go in or out -

883
01:06:24,547 --> 01:06:27,141
Get up against the fence.
Up against the fence and grab it.

884
01:06:27,249 --> 01:06:29,149
Get up against the fence.

885
01:06:29,251 --> 01:06:32,550
Now grab the fence,
or I will shoot you dead.

886
01:06:39,762 --> 01:06:41,730
What brings you out this evening, Mr. Gold?

887
01:06:42,832 --> 01:06:44,766
I want to know about the old woman.

888
01:06:44,867 --> 01:06:47,563
- We know nothing.
- I think she was involved in running guns.

889
01:06:47,670 --> 01:06:49,570
- Running guns?
- Long ago.

890
01:06:49,672 --> 01:06:52,402
- Why is that?
- I-I found a list.

891
01:06:52,508 --> 01:06:55,602
A list of Jewish names.
Men, here in this city.

892
01:06:55,711 --> 01:06:57,645
I think they were running guns with her. I -

893
01:06:57,747 --> 01:07:00,875
How did you get this address?
What are you doing here?

894
01:07:01,917 --> 01:07:03,817
Why are you here?

895
01:07:06,822 --> 01:07:08,790
I need help.

896
01:07:08,891 --> 01:07:11,291
I want to know why she was killed.

897
01:07:18,801 --> 01:07:20,769
All right.

898
01:07:41,123 --> 01:07:43,887
This way, Mr. Gold.

899
01:08:12,121 --> 01:08:14,180
Please. Sit down.

900
01:08:16,025 --> 01:08:18,926
See that gun?
I had one just like it.

901
01:08:19,028 --> 01:08:23,556
I gave mine to a kid in Hebron.
Last year. Two years ago.

902
01:08:23,666 --> 01:08:26,692
They told me it was an affectation
for me to still wear it.

903
01:08:26,802 --> 01:08:28,770
But you get used to it, you know.

904
01:08:28,871 --> 01:08:31,135
- Eh, Koli?
- That's right.

905
01:08:32,374 --> 01:08:35,400
Ah. Would you like
something to eat, Mr. Gold?

906
01:08:35,511 --> 01:08:37,809
- I'm going to have something to eat.

907
01:08:37,913 --> 01:08:39,813
- Barry, you want something?

908
01:08:39,915 --> 01:08:42,008
- Sure. Love to.
- Shot the old lady.

909
01:08:42,118 --> 01:08:44,678
- I know.
- Barry was with us in the old days.

910
01:08:44,787 --> 01:08:47,654
- That's right.
- And Lev and Marv.

911
01:08:49,291 --> 01:08:51,452
What a time that was, Mr. Gold.

912
01:08:51,560 --> 01:08:53,528
What a woman she was.

913
01:08:53,629 --> 01:08:56,393
- I want to find the men who killed her.
- Yes.

914
01:08:56,499 --> 01:08:58,729
And we need your help.

915
01:08:58,834 --> 01:09:00,859
- You have it.
- Yes.

916
01:09:02,371 --> 01:09:04,669
She was running guns, wasn't she?

917
01:09:04,773 --> 01:09:08,675
Yes. During our war of independence.

918
01:09:08,777 --> 01:09:11,541
In our country, we call her a hero.

919
01:09:11,647 --> 01:09:14,013
Why would anyone want to kill her now?

920
01:09:14,116 --> 01:09:17,313
I don't know, but we must find out.

921
01:09:17,419 --> 01:09:19,387
So many of us...

922
01:09:19,488 --> 01:09:23,049
good Americans,
who are good Jews...

923
01:09:23,159 --> 01:09:25,787
and good friends to Israel.

924
01:09:25,895 --> 01:09:29,422
- We always need such friends, you know.
- Isn't that the truth?

925
01:09:29,532 --> 01:09:31,625
Yes.

926
01:09:31,734 --> 01:09:34,168
You, uh -You're such a man.

927
01:09:34,270 --> 01:09:38,036
- I?
- You'd like to fight for your home.

928
01:09:39,742 --> 01:09:41,642
I would do anything.

929
01:09:45,247 --> 01:09:47,215
Now...

930
01:09:48,951 --> 01:09:50,919
we're going to find the killers.

931
01:09:51,020 --> 01:09:54,512
We're going to find them,
and we're going to deal with them.

932
01:09:54,623 --> 01:09:58,423
You mentioned something about a list.
Now, we need the list.

933
01:10:06,302 --> 01:10:08,862
No. No, no. The original.

934
01:10:08,971 --> 01:10:12,634
- It's at the precinct house.
- Oh, good. Bring it with you when next you come.

935
01:10:12,741 --> 01:10:14,834
- Asher will fill you in -
- I-I can't -

936
01:10:14,944 --> 01:10:18,004
Look. Excuse me.
I can't bring the original.

937
01:10:18,113 --> 01:10:22,447
- No. The original is what we need.
- That's what weneed.

938
01:10:22,551 --> 01:10:25,782
You see, it must be destroyed.

939
01:10:25,888 --> 01:10:30,450
She was killed. This man -
These men - Good men in a city.

940
01:10:30,559 --> 01:10:33,289
You see, they're in danger.

941
01:10:33,395 --> 01:10:35,386
- But -
- Yes?

942
01:10:37,366 --> 01:10:39,459
The list is evidence.

943
01:10:39,568 --> 01:10:41,832
I-I've logged it into an evidence bag.

944
01:10:41,937 --> 01:10:43,564
I - I've signed it in.

945
01:10:43,672 --> 01:10:46,072
Pl - Please.

946
01:10:46,175 --> 01:10:48,075
I -You know, anything.

947
01:10:48,177 --> 01:10:51,237
No. Not anything. I need the list.

948
01:10:51,347 --> 01:10:54,976
- Anything else.
- Yes. Yes. Anything else.

949
01:10:55,084 --> 01:10:57,518
Of course. Anything else.

950
01:11:09,031 --> 01:11:10,965
Zahab.

951
01:11:11,066 --> 01:11:14,229
That's your name in Hebrew.
Are you a Jew, Mr. Gold?

952
01:11:14,336 --> 01:11:16,930
- Yes.
- Then be a Jew.

953
01:11:17,039 --> 01:11:18,939
You can't get the list.

954
01:11:19,041 --> 01:11:22,067
How long your resolution last?
Until the first unpleasantness.

955
01:11:22,177 --> 01:11:25,510
- I'm a sworn police officer.
- Where are your loyalties?

956
01:11:25,614 --> 01:11:28,378
You want a home. You want glory.

957
01:11:28,484 --> 01:11:30,452
You're willing to do nothing.

958
01:11:30,552 --> 01:11:33,077
- I took an oath.
- Took an oath.

959
01:11:38,560 --> 01:11:40,528
He disgusts me.

960
01:11:41,597 --> 01:11:43,531
Get him out of here.

961
01:11:56,512 --> 01:11:59,948
Don't bother to return. The next time you come,
there'll be nobody here.

962
01:12:51,834 --> 01:12:53,301
Yes?

963
01:12:53,402 --> 01:12:56,633
I need -
I need to help.

964
01:12:56,739 --> 01:13:00,140
- In what way?
- I want to help you, in your work.

965
01:13:00,242 --> 01:13:02,210
- I work for the airlines.
- Please.

966
01:13:02,311 --> 01:13:05,610
Please, let me help -
with whatever you do.

967
01:13:05,714 --> 01:13:08,877
What I do, Mr. Gold, you don't want to know.

968
01:13:08,984 --> 01:13:11,179
No, but I do. I need to -

969
01:13:11,286 --> 01:13:13,481
Please. Whatever you're doing -

970
01:13:13,589 --> 01:13:16,319
what you're doing tonight -
let me help.

971
01:13:16,425 --> 01:13:19,553
Please. I'm begging you.

972
01:13:21,930 --> 01:13:23,898
Please.

973
01:13:31,306 --> 01:13:33,797
What can I tell ya about it?

974
01:13:33,909 --> 01:13:36,002
They said I was a pussy all my life.

975
01:13:37,613 --> 01:13:41,947
They said I was a pussy because I was a Jew.

976
01:13:43,085 --> 01:13:45,986
And the cops -
They'd say, ''Send a Jew?

977
01:13:46,088 --> 01:13:49,057
Might as well send a broad on a job.''

978
01:13:51,660 --> 01:13:54,254
''Send a broad through the door.''

979
01:13:55,364 --> 01:13:58,265
That's what they said.

980
01:13:58,367 --> 01:14:00,699
All my goddamn life.

981
01:14:00,803 --> 01:14:04,170
And I listened to it. Huh?

982
01:14:06,241 --> 01:14:09,904
I was the donkey.
I was the clown.

983
01:14:10,012 --> 01:14:12,503
- You were the outsider.
- Yes.

984
01:14:12,614 --> 01:14:16,778
- I understand.
- They made me the hostage negotiator...

985
01:14:20,222 --> 01:14:23,851
'cause I knew how the bad guys felt.

986
01:14:23,959 --> 01:14:26,154
Doing other people's work for them.

987
01:14:26,261 --> 01:14:28,855
- That's right.
- In their country.

988
01:14:28,964 --> 01:14:32,127
- Yes, that's right.
- And never working for yourself.

989
01:14:32,234 --> 01:14:34,794
- Yes.
- I know.

990
01:14:37,606 --> 01:14:39,506
Now, why would I do that?

991
01:14:47,850 --> 01:14:49,750
You have your own home.

992
01:14:49,852 --> 01:14:53,083
Yes. I do.

993
01:14:53,188 --> 01:14:56,021
Now, what can that be like?

994
01:14:58,327 --> 01:15:01,228
To have your own country.

995
01:15:01,330 --> 01:15:03,890
I'm gone so much of the time.

996
01:15:07,402 --> 01:15:09,302
But I think about it.

997
01:15:14,676 --> 01:15:16,644
I know.

998
01:15:17,846 --> 01:15:20,371
I sat with those guys tonight.

999
01:15:20,482 --> 01:15:23,974
With... heroes.

1000
01:15:24,086 --> 01:15:26,748
Jewish guys who had nothing to prove.

1001
01:15:28,090 --> 01:15:30,024
And I -

1002
01:15:30,125 --> 01:15:33,424
And I felt, Jesus, all my life...

1003
01:15:33,529 --> 01:15:36,191
I gotta be the first one in the door.

1004
01:15:36,298 --> 01:15:38,266
Huh?

1005
01:15:39,768 --> 01:15:41,668
Not for me.

1006
01:15:41,770 --> 01:15:43,704
All for someone else.

1007
01:15:43,805 --> 01:15:45,705
Why?

1008
01:15:47,175 --> 01:15:49,075
Because I'm no good.

1009
01:15:50,112 --> 01:15:52,012
Because I'm nobody.

1010
01:15:53,282 --> 01:15:55,307
I want to be a part of it.

1011
01:15:56,718 --> 01:15:58,686
That's all.

1012
01:16:06,628 --> 01:16:10,155
We think this leaflet
was printed at that shop.

1013
01:16:10,265 --> 01:16:14,861
The shop is owned by a Mr. Andersen, who's
head of a group called the United Action Front...

1014
01:16:14,970 --> 01:16:18,064
who we think may have had something
to do with the murder of Mrs. Klein.

1015
01:16:18,173 --> 01:16:20,073
And what were you sent here to do?

1016
01:16:20,175 --> 01:16:22,268
To find out if the leaflet was printed there.

1017
01:16:22,377 --> 01:16:27,076
- And if it was?
- If it was, I'm going to give them a message.

1018
01:16:27,182 --> 01:16:29,241
- I won't be long.
- Let me do it for you.

1019
01:16:29,351 --> 01:16:31,512
No, I can't do that.

1020
01:16:31,620 --> 01:16:35,147
Wait. Give that back to me.
Give it back.

1021
01:16:36,692 --> 01:16:39,786
- I can't let you do it.
- I'm going. How do I get in?

1022
01:16:39,895 --> 01:16:43,058
I'm going. If I don't go, nobody's going.
How do I get in?

1023
01:16:43,165 --> 01:16:45,133
All right, then.

1024
01:16:47,369 --> 01:16:49,394
- Can you use these lockpicks?
- Yes.

1025
01:16:49,504 --> 01:16:50,766
Can you use that?

1026
01:16:50,872 --> 01:16:53,466
The bottom button, then the top.

1027
01:21:57,112 --> 01:21:59,603
We went to that place.

1028
01:21:59,714 --> 01:22:02,308
- Good.
- I want to be a part of it.

1029
01:22:02,417 --> 01:22:04,715
Good. Then you are a part of it.

1030
01:22:04,819 --> 01:22:06,719
You've shown it.

1031
01:22:08,757 --> 01:22:10,725
And now there's something
we need from you.

1032
01:22:10,825 --> 01:22:14,386
- Yes.
- That list of names.

1033
01:22:14,496 --> 01:22:16,396
We need the list.

1034
01:22:16,498 --> 01:22:18,728
I told you.
As a policeman, I can't.

1035
01:22:18,833 --> 01:22:22,428
- We need it.
- What he wants - give it to him. Please.

1036
01:22:22,537 --> 01:22:24,471
I've explained it to him.

1037
01:22:24,572 --> 01:22:27,234
I can't. It's evidence. Wh -

1038
01:22:27,342 --> 01:22:29,742
Why do you want me to prove myself?
Haven't I done that tonight?

1039
01:22:29,844 --> 01:22:32,938
We don't want you to prove yourself.
We want the list.

1040
01:22:33,048 --> 01:22:34,379
No, I told you.

1041
01:22:40,288 --> 01:22:43,553
The building you entered
was under surveillance.

1042
01:22:43,658 --> 01:22:46,388
Here are some photographs
of you entering and leaving.

1043
01:22:47,429 --> 01:22:49,397
Look at them at your leisure.

1044
01:22:52,300 --> 01:22:54,268
We need the list.

1045
01:23:11,319 --> 01:23:15,415
The facts here speak for themselves.
You are nothing. Nothing.

1046
01:23:55,630 --> 01:23:57,598
Oh, my God.

1047
01:24:34,135 --> 01:24:37,298
I got a man hit.
I need an ambulance right now!

1048
01:24:37,405 --> 01:24:39,737
- Where were you?
- What happened? What went down?

1049
01:24:39,841 --> 01:24:41,468
Whole thing's gone bad.

1050
01:24:41,576 --> 01:24:43,942
Sully here. Lieu, I can see the guy.

1051
01:24:44,045 --> 01:24:46,878
Sullivan, pull out. Leave him there.
Let the SWAT get him.

1052
01:24:49,150 --> 01:24:52,677
You guys take cover!
Get over close to the road! Take cover!

1053
01:24:52,787 --> 01:24:56,188
Lieu, I got the uniform kid. He's hit bad.

1054
01:24:56,291 --> 01:25:00,728
Okay. Bring him down. Bring him around.
They got an ambulance coming in.

1055
01:25:01,763 --> 01:25:04,857
Sullivan, Frank-
you two guys get the hell out of there!

1056
01:25:06,634 --> 01:25:08,932
- Sully's hit, Lieu.
- Oh, God. Where are they?

1057
01:25:09,037 --> 01:25:11,733
- Sully's hit bad.
- Where is he? Where's Sullivan?

1058
01:25:13,441 --> 01:25:16,501
- Stuck on the second floor.
- Homicide. I'm on the corner of Fourth -

1059
01:25:16,611 --> 01:25:19,171
- Where's Sullivan?
- Yes, I see you. Don't come in.

1060
01:25:19,280 --> 01:25:21,771
Stay out! Stay out!

1061
01:25:21,883 --> 01:25:24,374
Tim, it's Bobby.
Can you hear me?

1062
01:25:26,154 --> 01:25:27,951
I'm going after Sullivan.

1063
01:25:36,231 --> 01:25:38,131
Help! Oh, my God!

1064
01:25:38,233 --> 01:25:40,394
- Someone get me out of here!
- Oh, God!

1065
01:25:40,502 --> 01:25:42,436
- Get me out!
- Charlie, give me some cover.

1066
01:25:42,537 --> 01:25:45,904
- You got it, Lieu.
- You two guys, get your ass over here.

1067
01:25:48,476 --> 01:25:51,468
- I'm hit!
- Bobby, get to cover right now!

1068
01:25:51,579 --> 01:25:53,911
- I'm going in after Sullivan!

1069
01:25:54,015 --> 01:25:56,040
All units -

1070
01:26:03,324 --> 01:26:07,055
Hey. Hey, can we get some help here?

1071
01:26:32,987 --> 01:26:35,979
- Yo!
- Where's the backup? Where is the backup?

1072
01:26:41,696 --> 01:26:43,960
- Hey.

1073
01:26:44,065 --> 01:26:46,761
Frankie, just hold up there. Just hold up there.

1074
01:26:46,868 --> 01:26:50,099
- I gotta get some blood here.
- We're working on it. Can we get some help here?

1075
01:26:50,205 --> 01:26:52,503
Lieu. Lieu. Where's the ambulance?

1076
01:26:52,607 --> 01:26:55,599
He shot the gun dry.
I said, ''Now, don't be doing that.

1077
01:26:55,710 --> 01:26:57,610
- You move around -

1078
01:26:57,712 --> 01:26:59,771
- Bobby.
- Hold on, Tim.

1079
01:27:01,883 --> 01:27:04,818
You see, Bobby?
Although, somebody told him to do that.

1080
01:27:04,919 --> 01:27:06,819
- Now, who would do that, Bob?
- Where's the medic?

1081
01:27:06,921 --> 01:27:08,821
- Frankie, what does the lieu say?
- Oh, God.

1082
01:27:08,923 --> 01:27:11,323
- Hold on, Tim.
- Can we get some help up here, Lieu?

1083
01:27:11,426 --> 01:27:13,417
- You know what I'm talking about?
- Yeah, yeah. That's right.

1084
01:27:13,528 --> 01:27:15,723
- Frankie, what does the lieu say?
- Do you know what I'm talking about?

1085
01:27:15,830 --> 01:27:18,355
- Yes, I do.
- But, finally...

1086
01:27:18,466 --> 01:27:20,957
what difference does it make
if you do or you don't?

1087
01:27:21,069 --> 01:27:23,299
I swear to Christ,
I don't know what they're talking about.

1088
01:27:23,404 --> 01:27:26,771
If you're moved, somebody's doing it.
Doesn't that have to be right, Bob?

1089
01:27:26,874 --> 01:27:29,638
- Yes, it does.
- Can we get some help up here, Lieu?

1090
01:27:29,744 --> 01:27:31,644
- Bob. Bob.
- Yes, Tim?

1091
01:27:31,746 --> 01:27:33,873
- Bobby.

1092
01:27:33,982 --> 01:27:35,950
You remember that girl that time, Bob?

1093
01:27:39,120 --> 01:27:41,020
Tim?

1094
01:27:48,796 --> 01:27:51,526
You shot my partner, you fucking nigger.
I'm gonna kill you.

1095
01:27:51,633 --> 01:27:53,601
- Who's got a walkie?
- Get low. Get low.

1096
01:27:54,035 --> 01:27:55,662
We need a stretcher in here.

1097
01:31:09,797 --> 01:31:11,822
Came for me, motherfucker?

1098
01:31:11,933 --> 01:31:15,096
- What you want me for?
- I came here to kill you.

1099
01:31:15,203 --> 01:31:18,764
Yeah, well, you forgot your gun, Jim.
Where's your gun?

1100
01:31:27,849 --> 01:31:30,716
That's death calling, baby-
for you and for me.

1101
01:31:30,818 --> 01:31:34,777
- Should I use you to bargain my way out of here?
- You know they won't bargain for me.

1102
01:31:34,889 --> 01:31:37,915
Yeah, that's so, ain't it?
Well, then I guess I best help myself.

1103
01:31:38,025 --> 01:31:41,722
You sorry fuckin' sack of shit.

1104
01:31:43,130 --> 01:31:45,064
You shot my partner.

1105
01:31:45,166 --> 01:31:48,727
Yeah, man, and you could have paid me back
if you would've brought your gun.

1106
01:31:48,836 --> 01:31:51,327
That was your mistake, man.

1107
01:31:51,439 --> 01:31:54,374
- What's your name?
- Gold.

1108
01:31:55,409 --> 01:31:57,343
Robert Gold.

1109
01:31:57,445 --> 01:32:00,414
Well, Mr. Gold, I'm just about
on my way out of here.

1110
01:32:00,515 --> 01:32:03,143
I got a moment.
You want to tell me your last thought?

1111
01:32:03,251 --> 01:32:06,243
- No.
- You want to beg for your life?

1112
01:32:06,354 --> 01:32:08,254
No.

1113
01:32:08,356 --> 01:32:09,914
No?

1114
01:32:10,024 --> 01:32:11,753
It's not worth anything.

1115
01:32:11,859 --> 01:32:15,659
Well, ain't that a shame, huh?
After all your trials, you come down to nothin'.

1116
01:32:15,763 --> 01:32:17,663
Yeah. These motherfuckers got lucky.

1117
01:32:17,765 --> 01:32:20,666
An hour ago, I would have been
on a plane, long gone out of here.

1118
01:32:20,768 --> 01:32:22,827
No. You weren't going anywhere.

1119
01:32:22,937 --> 01:32:24,837
What the fuck you know, man?

1120
01:32:24,939 --> 01:32:27,203
My mama had it all set up.

1121
01:32:27,308 --> 01:32:30,675
The ticket, the passport.
I would have been long gone out of here.

1122
01:32:30,778 --> 01:32:34,043
But that's all right.
Now I gotta do it the hard way. You know?

1123
01:32:34,148 --> 01:32:37,982
- Yeah. I know it all.
- Oh, you know, huh?

1124
01:32:39,186 --> 01:32:42,451
You're one smart kike, ain't you, Mr. Gold?

1125
01:32:42,557 --> 01:32:45,822
All you forgot is that,
if you want to kill me...

1126
01:32:45,927 --> 01:32:47,895
you best come armed.

1127
01:32:50,431 --> 01:32:52,058
Randolph.

1128
01:32:52,166 --> 01:32:54,464
Randolph.

1129
01:32:54,569 --> 01:32:57,333
- Later, baby.
- Your mother turned you in.

1130
01:32:57,438 --> 01:32:59,497
You know she did it.

1131
01:32:59,607 --> 01:33:02,701
- How else did we find you here?
- You're a lying motherfucker, man.

1132
01:33:02,810 --> 01:33:05,472
You don't know my mother.
You ain't never seen my mother.

1133
01:33:10,918 --> 01:33:13,580
I -

1134
01:33:13,688 --> 01:33:16,213
Look at you, man.
You're a piece of shit.

1135
01:33:16,324 --> 01:33:18,292
That's right.

1136
01:33:18,392 --> 01:33:20,485
I am a piece of shit.

1137
01:33:20,595 --> 01:33:22,893
It's all a piece of shit.

1138
01:33:22,997 --> 01:33:27,491
I killed my partner,
and your mama turned you in.

1139
01:33:27,602 --> 01:33:29,399
Don't die with a lie on your lips, man.

1140
01:33:29,503 --> 01:33:33,405
You want your passport?
I got it.

1141
01:33:33,507 --> 01:33:35,907
It's a phony.

1142
01:33:36,010 --> 01:33:38,570
All that shit, man- we made it up.

1143
01:33:38,679 --> 01:33:40,408
Look at it.

1144
01:33:40,514 --> 01:33:44,416
Your mama turned you over, man.
Look at it!

1145
01:33:53,127 --> 01:33:55,027
That's right.

1146
01:34:06,941 --> 01:34:08,909
God.

1147
01:34:10,244 --> 01:34:12,212
God help me.

1148
01:34:21,722 --> 01:34:24,657
- What did you do to me?
- Six to H.R.T. base.

1149
01:34:24,759 --> 01:34:26,659
You're secure now.

1150
01:34:28,295 --> 01:34:31,389
Base to Six. Copy. 12-15 standing down.

1151
01:34:31,499 --> 01:34:34,593
And you can report landline.
Base clean.

1152
01:34:34,702 --> 01:34:37,296
- I'm all right.
- Got an entrance wound.
Upper-right chest area.

1153
01:34:37,405 --> 01:34:39,430
- Keep the light on him.
- I'm okay.

1154
01:34:39,540 --> 01:34:42,008
Priority wound alert to shock trauma unit.

1155
01:34:44,779 --> 01:34:47,111
- It's all in order. Good job. Thanks.
- Do you want them now?

1156
01:34:47,214 --> 01:34:49,808
- When you get back there.
- Want me to send them downtown?

1157
01:34:49,917 --> 01:34:51,885
- Let me look at 'em.
- All right.

1158
01:34:56,991 --> 01:34:59,221
You want to hear the rest of this or not?

1159
01:34:59,326 --> 01:35:01,385
- Tell me later.
- Okay. Get out of here.

1160
01:35:01,495 --> 01:35:04,555
- Now don't go bossing me around.
- I'm not bossing you. I'm begging you.

1161
01:35:04,665 --> 01:35:06,565
- See you later.
- See ya.

1162
01:35:06,667 --> 01:35:09,329
When you get down on Fifth Street,
you're going to see what I mean.

1163
01:35:09,437 --> 01:35:13,999
- Who do I talk to down there?
- When they gave up the shotgun -
When they come in with the shotgun -

1164
01:35:14,108 --> 01:35:16,474
- They-
- Hey, Bob.

1165
01:35:16,577 --> 01:35:18,772
- Hello.
- Hi.

1166
01:35:18,879 --> 01:35:22,007
I'm sorry about Sullivan.

1167
01:35:23,617 --> 01:35:25,517
Yeah.

1168
01:35:29,724 --> 01:35:31,749
We gotta roll.

1169
01:35:31,859 --> 01:35:33,793
Yeah.

1170
01:35:33,894 --> 01:35:36,294
Maybe I'll see you later.

1171
01:35:36,397 --> 01:35:38,797
Have some coffee.

1172
01:35:38,899 --> 01:35:41,629
See ya around, Bob.

1173
01:35:41,736 --> 01:35:43,829
Yeah.

1174
01:35:43,938 --> 01:35:46,236
All right.
Now, what are you gonna bring me back?

1175
01:35:46,340 --> 01:35:48,740
- I bring back the whole consignment.
- And log it in.

1176
01:35:48,843 --> 01:35:50,936
- Should I take a can?
- Yeah.

1177
01:35:51,045 --> 01:35:53,411
That way you get the shotgun,
we log it...

1178
01:35:53,514 --> 01:35:55,482
we match it for prints and ballistics.

1179
01:35:55,583 --> 01:35:57,608
The shell is distinct.
I'll get on that right away.

1180
01:35:57,718 --> 01:35:59,618
That's exactly what I wanted to do.

1181
01:35:59,720 --> 01:36:02,416
That's just the way it is.
You took your shot, this is what happened.

1182
01:36:02,523 --> 01:36:05,856
And if you're moved, somebody's gotta be doing it.
Doesn't that have to be right?

1183
01:36:05,960 --> 01:36:08,224
I want you to do the following thing.

1184
01:36:08,329 --> 01:36:11,765
Log this stuff in, Frank,
and then when you get downtown, you-

1185
01:36:13,033 --> 01:36:15,399
We solved your case for you.

1186
01:36:15,503 --> 01:36:17,471
Come on.

1187
01:36:17,571 --> 01:36:21,735
I told you why we killed her, man -
because she had that fortune in her basement.

1188
01:36:26,247 --> 01:36:28,215
You're off Homicide.

1189
01:36:30,384 --> 01:36:32,352
You're off.

1190
01:36:34,221 --> 01:36:36,246
- Let's go.
- We would have got it, too...

1191
01:36:36,357 --> 01:36:39,190
- if that dog wouldn't have scared us off.
- Get'em out of here.

1192
01:37:29,710 --> 01:37:31,678
We've been holding this for ya.
