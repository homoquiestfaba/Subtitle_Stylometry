576
00:42:25,710 --> 00:42:29,948
I was coming home from
the bar, it was late.

577
00:42:33,051 --> 00:42:34,387
I don't even know why
I went to the bar,

578
00:42:34,520 --> 00:42:36,522
I don't like gay bars,

579
00:42:37,523 --> 00:42:42,561
but a few hours go
by, and I'm drunk,

580
00:42:43,796 --> 00:42:48,467
and tired of white dudes
ignoring me, so I go home.

581
00:42:51,937 --> 00:42:53,939
When I'm at the station
I see this dude,

582
00:42:54,073 --> 00:42:58,011
this beautiful Latino dude.

583
00:42:59,313 --> 00:43:03,950
He notices me, and I
wink, and he smiles,

584
00:43:04,084 --> 00:43:06,820
and I walk over to him,
and I give him my number.

585
00:43:08,355 --> 00:43:11,258
When he leans in he
kisses me right there.

586
00:43:12,159 --> 00:43:13,393
This is before I met you.

587
00:43:16,630 --> 00:43:17,864
Now in the corner of my eye

588
00:43:17,998 --> 00:43:21,201
I can see this old
white lady frowning,

589
00:43:22,437 --> 00:43:25,139
and so I pull him closer,
and we make out hard

590
00:43:25,273 --> 00:43:27,375
right there until
my train comes.

You know I never
do stuff like that.

593
00:43:38,186 --> 00:43:42,123
And I'm walking back, and
this silver car pulls up,

594
00:43:43,759 --> 00:43:45,961
and he lays down,
rolls down his window,

595
00:43:46,095 --> 00:43:50,399
and he, he says,
"Where's the party at?"

596
00:43:51,433 --> 00:43:53,202
At first I thought he
was trying to hit on me,

597
00:43:53,335 --> 00:43:56,538
you know like I was gonna
quip with something funny,

598
00:43:56,672 --> 00:43:59,274

that kiss, you know.

599

And um,

600
00:44:07,516 --> 00:44:08,417
he shot me,

601
00:44:12,389 --> 00:44:17,427
he shot me, and I'm just laying
there, and he drives off.

602
00:44:18,495 --> 00:44:20,196

don't let me go out like this,

cliche boys in the hood

thinking about the bar,

605
00:44:29,406 --> 00:44:32,208
and the station, and
kissing that dude,

606
00:44:32,342 --> 00:44:35,446
and I just wish none of that
shit ever happened, you know.

607
00:44:39,083 --> 00:44:42,888
The craziest part is I actually

608
00:44:43,020 --> 00:44:44,989
thought he was
trying to hit on me,

609
00:44:49,627 --> 00:44:50,528

[Ben] No, thank you.

723
00:51:06,653 --> 00:51:10,991
You know this
whole Jerry Sandusky,

724
00:51:13,828 --> 00:51:15,830
got more kids coming
out every day.

725
00:51:20,801 --> 00:51:22,703
And how many of those
boys were black?

726
00:51:22,838 --> 00:51:24,306
No one talks about that, Sam.

727
00:51:24,438 --> 00:51:25,774
Come on, Dad.

728
00:51:25,907 --> 00:51:29,476
People ask questions
what's taking so long.

729
00:51:29,610 --> 00:51:31,612
Principal didn't
believe those kids.

730
00:51:31,745 --> 00:51:35,083
Took a half dozen for them
to even question Jerry.

731
00:51:36,517 --> 00:51:39,788
Half these kids' fathers
didn't believe them.

732
00:51:40,856 --> 00:51:42,356
Can you believe that, Sam?

00:51:55,570 --> 00:51:58,573
Have you ever
talked to someone?

735
00:52:00,709 --> 00:52:03,112
[Ben] What do you mean?

736
00:52:03,246 --> 00:52:04,814
Like a therapist?

737
00:52:05,680 --> 00:52:06,782
[Sam] Uh, yeah.

738
00:52:08,750 --> 00:52:10,486

all the answers, Ben,

but we certainly
do try. [laughs]

Oh, Klonopin, she such a bitch.

I need to, we're gonna work now.

750
00:52:50,228 --> 00:52:51,796
Okay, let's focus.

751
00:52:51,930 --> 00:52:55,666
I'm so glad I found
someone in my network.

752
00:52:55,800 --> 00:52:56,834
You're super affordable.

753
00:52:56,969 --> 00:52:59,671
Oh, yeah, tell me about it.

754
00:52:59,805 --> 00:53:03,108
The new company
fucked me big time.

A real shocker, two in the
pink, one in the shrink.

00:53:07,413 --> 00:53:08,781
[Ben] What?

757
00:53:08,914 --> 00:53:11,649
You know most therapist
are so stuffy, Ben.

758
00:53:11,784 --> 00:53:13,786
You know they, they
sit there wanking away.

759
00:53:13,919 --> 00:53:15,788
We don't wank, we listen.

760
00:53:15,921 --> 00:53:17,455
Well, she's deaf,
she can't hear,

761

but I am here and listening.

She's just here
sending you some love.

763
00:53:26,800 --> 00:53:29,102
So tell us about you.

764
00:53:29,235 --> 00:53:30,602
The floor is yours.

765
00:53:38,677 --> 00:53:39,779
It's a safe space.

766
00:53:44,616 --> 00:53:45,987
You were born.

[Ben sighs]

768
00:53:51,624 --> 00:53:54,895
I guess it's been a few years

769
00:53:56,931 --> 00:53:58,598
since I tried to tell someone.

[Ben sighs]

771
00:54:01,634 --> 00:54:06,506
And it's like uh, it took
forever to get everything out,

772
00:54:07,842 --> 00:54:11,645
and when it finally
came it was like uh,

773
00:54:13,382 --> 00:54:16,385
it was like I had
cooked this meal, right,

774
00:54:17,651 --> 00:54:22,290
this lifelong meal, and she
just shoved it into her mouth,

775
00:54:26,094 --> 00:54:28,030
and shit it out in front of me.

776
00:54:29,998 --> 00:54:31,833
Shit it out in front of you.

777
00:54:31,967 --> 00:54:32,801
So it wasn't satisfying?

778
00:54:32,935 --> 00:54:34,837
It wasn't ceremonious?

00:54:36,205 --> 00:54:37,106
- No.
- No.

00:54:42,912 --> 00:54:44,746
That's just awful.

It's really awful.

It's really, really awful.

783
00:54:50,086 --> 00:54:53,022
You were just a number,
that's how you felt, yes?

784
00:54:54,023 --> 00:54:56,826
Okay, well, tell me
more about yourself.

New York for three years now.

made in New Hampshire,

01:27:06,836 --> 01:27:08,372
So good phone call today, huh?

1251
01:27:08,505 --> 01:27:09,473
- I texted you.
- Yeah.

1252
01:27:09,605 --> 01:27:10,340
You talked to Celia, right?

1253
01:27:10,474 --> 01:27:11,808
- Yeah.
- Great.

1254
01:27:11,942 --> 01:27:13,444
Let's go back in
though, let's go back in.

1255
01:27:13,576 --> 01:27:15,112
No, no need, we did all
the tests, nothing came up.

1256
01:27:15,245 --> 01:27:16,579
You're good.

1257
01:27:16,712 --> 01:27:18,148
[Ben] Yeah, but, Doc, you
know I still have nausea, okay.

1258
01:27:18,282 --> 01:27:19,918
- I still get the headaches.
- I understand,

1259
01:27:20,051 --> 01:27:21,386
- but you talked to Celia.
- This doesn't come

1260
01:27:21,519 --> 01:27:22,854
- out of nowhere though.
- You talked to Celia.

1261
01:27:22,987 --> 01:27:24,456
This doesn't come
out of nowhere.

1262
01:27:24,588 --> 01:27:25,789
Doc, I had, I had red marks
on my arms you saw that,

1263
01:27:25,924 --> 01:27:26,891
I couldn't invent that.

1264
01:27:27,025 --> 01:27:28,460
I'm not saying you did, Ben.

1265
01:27:28,592 --> 01:27:30,295
I'm just saying
that you're fine.

1266
01:27:30,428 --> 01:27:32,030
You should enjoy that news.

1267
01:27:33,331 --> 01:27:34,832
Okay.

1268
01:27:34,966 --> 01:27:38,336
All right, Monday, Monday,
you go home now I understand

1269
01:27:38,470 --> 01:27:41,638
but Monday I'll come back in
okay, and we can just talk,

1270
01:27:41,772 --> 01:27:43,808
and we get to the
bottom of it, okay?

1271
01:27:43,943 --> 01:27:46,112
Have you talked to
your mother about this?

1272
01:27:56,288 --> 01:27:59,091
I can't tell you why you're
feeling the way you feel,

1273
01:28:00,825 --> 01:28:02,094
I'm just a doctor.

1274
01:28:08,667 --> 01:28:09,768
[knuckles tapping]

1275
01:28:12,405 --> 01:28:14,975
[door creaking]

1276
01:28:15,108 --> 01:28:16,176
- Hey.
- Hey, how ya doing?

1277
01:28:16,309 --> 01:28:17,810
[Sam] What's
happening, old man?

1278
01:28:17,944 --> 01:28:20,113
Middle of the week,
this is a surprise.

1279
01:28:23,816 --> 01:28:24,918
All right.

1280
01:28:26,486 --> 01:28:29,089
[Sam] Can I sit
down for a second?

1281
01:28:29,222 --> 01:28:30,756
Sure, come on.

1282
01:28:32,493 --> 01:28:33,294
You all right?

1283
01:28:33,427 --> 01:28:34,295
[door creaking]

1284
01:28:34,428 --> 01:28:35,363
[door bangs]

1285
01:28:35,496 --> 01:28:36,397
[insects chirping]

1286
01:28:45,739 --> 01:28:49,644
[Girl yells]
[train engine humming]

1287
01:28:49,776 --> 01:28:50,878
[Girl giggling]

1288
01:28:59,855 --> 01:29:01,924
[insects chirping]

1289
01:29:02,057 --> 01:29:05,160
[train horn honking]

1290
01:29:34,624 --> 01:29:36,192
[Debbie] I put in extra Tang.

1291
01:29:39,996 --> 01:29:42,432
Tang doesn't go in
Long Island iced tea, Ma.

1292
01:29:43,234 --> 01:29:44,935
[Debbie] It goes in mine.

1293
01:29:46,303 --> 01:29:48,038
- Cheers.
- Cheers.

1294
01:29:53,310 --> 01:29:54,844
Mmm, delicious.

1295
01:29:55,778 --> 01:29:58,148
Long Island ice
teas for astronauts.

1296
01:29:59,250 --> 01:30:02,119
It's crazy how everything's
grown in, huh, Benny.

1297
01:30:03,654 --> 01:30:04,989
Little paradise.

1298
01:30:07,292 --> 01:30:09,227
You forget there was
even a tree over there.

1299
01:30:09,361 --> 01:30:10,262
Look.

1300
01:30:19,037 --> 01:30:21,273
You wouldn't have remembered
unless I told you.

1301
01:30:25,210 --> 01:30:28,113
Thanks for coming out and
visiting your old momma.

1302
01:30:28,980 --> 01:30:30,883
She loves seeing her boy.

1303
01:30:38,124 --> 01:30:39,258
You hear them?

1304
01:30:41,160 --> 01:30:43,795
We haven't had a
brood like this since.

1305
01:30:43,929 --> 01:30:45,031
'96.

1306
01:30:50,469 --> 01:30:52,338
Your dad didn't
have his hernia.

1307
01:30:53,773 --> 01:30:55,275
I had a beautiful perm.

1308
01:30:58,278 --> 01:31:03,383
Cat was, uh '94,
very good memory.

1309
01:31:10,724 --> 01:31:13,126
You know they say
this batch is special.

1310
01:31:13,894 --> 01:31:15,262
I watched a "TED Talk".

1311
01:31:16,163 --> 01:31:19,000
They only come out
every 17 years, so see,

1312
01:31:19,133 --> 01:31:21,302
yeah, you're right, '96.

1313
01:31:23,204 --> 01:31:25,540
Some think it's a
survival mechanism.

1314
01:31:27,141 --> 01:31:30,078
The prime numbers
prevent their predators

1315
01:31:30,211 --> 01:31:32,013
from knowing their patterns.

1316
01:31:33,448 --> 01:31:35,183
They live underground
all their lives

1317
01:31:35,316 --> 01:31:37,485
and then one day
they all come out,

1318
01:31:37,618 --> 01:31:41,489
climb up the big trees,
spread their wings,

1319
01:31:41,622 --> 01:31:46,261
and play us their little
songs, and we listen.

1320
01:31:59,842 --> 01:32:01,110
I just want you to know

1321
01:32:01,243 --> 01:32:03,245
that I love you and
Sam so much, Benny.

1322
01:32:04,279 --> 01:32:06,081
You make me very happy.

1323
01:32:09,652 --> 01:32:10,920
I love you too, Ma.

1324
01:32:15,358 --> 01:32:17,961
Hey, how about you and your
momma go to the beach tomorrow

1325
01:32:18,094 --> 01:32:19,362
like the old days, huh?

1326
01:32:20,563 --> 01:32:24,167
We'll go to Robert Moses,
I'll buy you a snow cone.

1327
01:32:25,068 --> 01:32:26,636
I'll let you pee in the water.

1328
01:32:28,738 --> 01:32:30,006
[Ben] It's a date.

1329
01:32:30,140 --> 01:32:31,942
It's a date?

1330
01:32:32,076 --> 01:32:33,277
It's a date.

1331
01:32:53,130 --> 01:32:54,632
Hey, Ma.

1332
01:32:54,766 --> 01:32:55,667
Yeah, Benny?

1333
01:33:00,472 --> 01:33:01,373
[Ben whimpering]

1334
01:33:18,523 --> 01:33:19,992
What is it, Ben?

1335
01:33:21,227 --> 01:33:23,362
[wind blowing]

1336
01:33:23,496 --> 01:33:26,299
I gotta tell you something.
