<i>¶ We'll be fighting</i>

<i>¶ With our children</i>

3
00:00:38,472 --> 00:00:42,041

00:01:28,089 --> 00:01:32,524
Hey, Dildo,
get that mangy mutt out of here.

15
00:01:34,428 --> 00:01:37,362
<i>Dildo. That's what</i>
<i>my old man called me,</i>

16
00:01:37,364 --> 00:01:38,831
<i>Dildo Dunphy.</i>

17
00:01:43,471 --> 00:01:46,405
Can you believe
this fucking town?

18
00:01:46,407 --> 00:01:47,573
This blows.

19
00:01:47,575 --> 00:01:48,574
Dunph, give me another beer.

20
00:01:48,576 --> 00:01:51,577
None left. Just lemonade.

21
00:01:51,579 --> 00:01:53,145
All right.

22
00:01:56,784 --> 00:01:58,517
Hey, let's go
to the parking lot.

23
00:01:58,519 --> 00:02:00,385
What for? All guys.

24
00:02:00,387 --> 00:02:02,454
How about the field?

25
00:02:02,456 --> 00:02:04,289
Fuck the field.

26
00:02:04,291 --> 00:02:06,792
Where do the girls go
at night, huh?

27
00:02:06,794 --> 00:02:09,261
You know what?
We should go to the edge.

28
00:02:09,263 --> 00:02:11,263
Sully stinkfingered Bunny Cote
over there.

29
00:02:11,265 --> 00:02:13,432
What?
They were doing bongs and shit.

30
00:02:13,434 --> 00:02:15,534
And he stinkfingered her
in his car.

31
00:02:15,536 --> 00:02:17,836
With his finger, Sully.
How do you know?

32
00:02:17,838 --> 00:02:21,173
His finger stunk. Drugs,

33
00:02:21,175 --> 00:02:23,575
you smelled his finger?

34
00:02:24,778 --> 00:02:27,379
You retard.

35
00:02:27,381 --> 00:02:29,414
<i>That's my brother, Jackie.</i>

36
00:02:29,416 --> 00:02:31,750
<i>He had a freak accident</i>
<i>when he was a kid.</i>

37
00:02:31,752 --> 00:02:33,886
<i>You see,</i>
<i>we were playing touch football,</i>

38
00:02:33,888 --> 00:02:35,521
<i>and, uh,</i>
<i>well, he fell off the roof.</i>

39
00:02:35,523 --> 00:02:37,856
Everybody's hard on Nixon.

40
00:02:37,858 --> 00:02:40,225
- Right, well, why not?
- Guy's a putz.

41
00:02:40,227 --> 00:02:43,362
He didn't do nothing all
those other assholes didn't do.

42
00:02:43,364 --> 00:02:45,364
Yeah, he did. He got pinched.

43
00:02:45,366 --> 00:02:47,432
Please, that was
a fucking witch-hunt.

44
00:02:47,434 --> 00:02:49,668
Those two Jewish bastards gave
a shit about this country,

45
00:02:49,670 --> 00:02:51,203
they'd have kept
their traps shut.

46
00:02:51,205 --> 00:02:53,305
Cavwich,
Woodward ain't Jewish, okay?

47
00:02:53,307 --> 00:02:55,774
Those guys are reporters.
They're just doing their job.

48
00:02:55,776 --> 00:02:57,609
They're stool pigeons.

49
00:02:57,611 --> 00:02:59,478
You don't accuse the president

50
00:02:59,480 --> 00:03:00,879
of the highest office
in the land of stuff

51
00:03:00,881 --> 00:03:02,681
when all you got is
some lousy erased tapes.

52
00:03:02,683 --> 00:03:04,449
It isn't enough.

53
00:03:04,451 --> 00:03:06,852
Especially all the guy's trying
to do is cover his own ass.

54
00:03:06,854 --> 00:03:08,487
Thank you.

55
00:03:08,489 --> 00:03:10,422
What did this clown ever do
for us besides go to China?

56
00:03:10,424 --> 00:03:12,491
- I guarantee...
- Jackie.

57
00:03:12,493 --> 00:03:14,726
...that 20 years from now,
because of Nixon,

58
00:03:14,728 --> 00:03:17,629
that our friends will be
right beside us fighting.

59
00:03:17,631 --> 00:03:19,731
Jackie. What's up?

60
00:03:19,733 --> 00:03:22,401
Go in my room
and get me my bong.

61
00:03:22,403 --> 00:03:24,703
Which one? The big one.

62
00:03:24,705 --> 00:03:28,440
Dildo, what the hell are
you doing out there?

63
00:03:28,442 --> 00:03:29,908
He's getting my jacket.

64
00:03:29,910 --> 00:03:33,378
I didn't want to bug you guys
during your game.

65
00:03:33,380 --> 00:03:34,880
What bug? Who are you bugging?

66
00:03:34,882 --> 00:03:38,250
Now drag your pimply ass in here
and say hi to the guys.

67
00:03:38,252 --> 00:03:40,686
Show some class, for crissakes.

68
00:03:42,556 --> 00:03:44,756
Dunph, I can't go in there.
I'm too fucked up.

69
00:03:46,994 --> 00:03:50,362
Hey, Dildo!

70
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:52,364
What are you other
dip-shits up to?

71
00:03:52,366 --> 00:03:54,499
Nothing.

72
00:03:54,501 --> 00:03:55,701
Hey, Mousy.

73
00:03:55,703 --> 00:03:56,969
Hmm?

74
00:03:56,971 --> 00:03:58,303
What's this shit?

75
00:03:58,305 --> 00:04:01,240
That's a beard.

76
00:04:01,242 --> 00:04:03,408
What the fuck does someone your
age need a beard for?

77
00:04:03,410 --> 00:04:06,345
You know what they say about
guys with beards, aren't you?

78
00:04:06,347 --> 00:04:08,947
Queers. Queers?

79
00:04:08,949 --> 00:04:10,816
Yeah, every one of them.

80
00:04:10,818 --> 00:04:12,784
What do you think
they're going for?

81
00:04:12,786 --> 00:04:14,786
They're afraid they look
too much like broads.

82
00:04:14,788 --> 00:04:16,488
<i>That's Cavwich.</i>

83
00:04:16,490 --> 00:04:18,924
<i>He's a used-car salesman,</i>
<i>claims he's connected.</i>

84
00:04:18,926 --> 00:04:21,560
What about Abraham Lincoln?

85
00:04:21,562 --> 00:04:24,429
Lincoln? Queer as they come.

86
00:04:24,431 --> 00:04:26,932
You got farts in your head.

87
00:04:26,934 --> 00:04:28,735
I'm telling you, it's true.

88
00:04:28,736 --> 00:04:31,436
It ain't me.
Look it up in the book.

89
00:04:31,438 --> 00:04:33,672
Here, Dunph,
here's your jacket.

90
00:04:38,312 --> 00:04:40,646
Whoa, whoa, whoa.
What the fuck?

91
00:04:44,852 --> 00:04:47,619
What in the world
is this contraption?

92
00:04:47,621 --> 00:04:49,755
It's a horn.

93
00:04:49,757 --> 00:04:51,323
A horn?

94
00:04:51,325 --> 00:04:54,660
Yeah, you know,
like a music horn.

95
00:04:54,662 --> 00:04:57,029
Yeah, it's a horn.

96
00:04:57,031 --> 00:05:00,399
Okay, Satchmo, why don't you
play us a few notes?

97
00:05:17,418 --> 00:05:20,319
All right, ass-bag.
Enough of that nonsense.

98
00:05:20,321 --> 00:05:21,887
Why don't you and those other
ass-bags get out of here

99
00:05:21,889 --> 00:05:24,589
and quit bugging us?

100
00:05:24,591 --> 00:05:26,458
See you later.

101
00:05:29,797 --> 00:05:32,864
<i>¶ I'd like to know where</i>
<i>You got the notion ¶</i>

103
00:05:34,034 --> 00:05:35,567

111
00:05:53,654 --> 00:05:55,787
They look like a bunch of fags.

112
00:05:55,789 --> 00:05:58,490
I know.

113
00:05:58,492 --> 00:06:00,759
I'd be a fag too if
I could get that kind of pussy.

114
00:06:00,761 --> 00:06:02,794
You just said you'd be a fag.

115
00:06:02,796 --> 00:06:04,730
Yeah. Then I could get
that kind of pussy.

116
00:06:04,732 --> 00:06:08,433
No amount of babes in the world
is worth being a homo for.

117
00:06:08,435 --> 00:06:10,716
Hey, there's Bunny Cote.

118
00:06:14,575 --> 00:06:17,509
Let's go talk to her.

119
00:06:17,511 --> 00:06:19,911
No, I'm not talking to her.
You go talk to her.

120
00:06:21,415 --> 00:06:22,914
Hey, Dunph.

121
00:06:22,916 --> 00:06:24,916
Hi, Bunny.

122
00:06:24,918 --> 00:06:27,519
Want to dance?

123
00:06:27,521 --> 00:06:30,655
Nah. I'm not very good
at disco dancing.

124
00:06:30,657 --> 00:06:34,526
So just regular dance. Come on.

125
00:06:34,528 --> 00:06:35,761

126

132

So how's Sully?

139
00:07:22,075 --> 00:07:25,110
Write the fucking thing, please?
Write the fucking thing.

140
00:07:25,112 --> 00:07:28,213
All gone.

141
00:07:30,818 --> 00:07:33,685
Whoa, That fucking
packs a punch, man.

142
00:07:43,130 --> 00:07:45,130
Aw, fuck.

143
00:07:45,132 --> 00:07:46,998
Aw, shit.

144
00:07:47,000 --> 00:07:49,801
Oh, fuck me.

145
00:07:49,803 --> 00:07:53,505
Oh, my God.

146
00:08:10,557 --> 00:08:12,824
A horn, huh?

147
00:08:15,496 --> 00:08:17,496
A music horn.

148
00:08:23,003 --> 00:08:24,836
Fuck.

149
00:08:24,838 --> 00:08:26,638
Damn moron.

150
00:08:31,612 --> 00:08:34,913
A prep school?
What's a prep school?

151
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:36,815
It's to prepare you

152
00:08:36,817 --> 00:08:39,951
for not getting
your neck broke by me.

153
00:08:39,953 --> 00:08:42,954
You're just goddamn lucky
Cavwich had pull with the judge.

154
00:08:42,956 --> 00:08:45,056
Grass, no license.

155
00:08:45,058 --> 00:08:48,260
You hit a parked cop car.

156
00:08:48,262 --> 00:08:51,596
Don't get me started
again, Dildo.

157
00:08:51,598 --> 00:08:54,733
But, Pop,
I'm gonna be a senior.

158
00:08:54,735 --> 00:08:57,135
You can't send me away
my senior year.

159
00:08:57,137 --> 00:09:00,539
Aw, let me go
and get my violin.

160
00:09:00,541 --> 00:09:02,974
One more thing.

161
00:09:02,976 --> 00:09:07,212
Cut that fucking mop
on top of your head

162
00:09:07,214 --> 00:09:10,148
or I will cut it for you.

163
00:09:16,023 --> 00:09:18,290
Just can't believe this shit.

164
00:09:18,292 --> 00:09:20,592
Look at my fucking head.

165
00:09:20,594 --> 00:09:23,595
So, where is this place anyway?

166
00:09:23,597 --> 00:09:26,831
Two and a half hours from here
in Cornwall, Connecticut.

167
00:09:26,833 --> 00:09:29,968
Least you'll be getting out
of this fucking shithole.

168
00:09:29,970 --> 00:09:32,137
You really think the Bucket's
a shithole, mousy?

169
00:09:32,139 --> 00:09:34,906
Should put a toilet seat
on top of this place.

170
00:09:34,908 --> 00:09:37,008
If it sucks so bad, why don't
you move to Providence?

171
00:09:37,010 --> 00:09:38,743
Like that would
change anything.

172
00:09:38,745 --> 00:09:42,647
California. When I graduate
that's where I'm heading.

173
00:09:42,649 --> 00:09:45,317
California. They got babes
like a bastard out there.

174
00:09:45,319 --> 00:09:48,053
It's because they're rich there.

175
00:09:48,055 --> 00:09:50,188
Rich guys marry babes.
It's called breeding.

176
00:09:50,190 --> 00:09:53,959
They got babes, they got weed.
They got cars that don't rust.

177
00:09:53,961 --> 00:09:57,862
Weed and cars that don't rust?
Fucking A, I'm all over that.

178
00:09:57,864 --> 00:10:02,133
You fucking losers go.
I'm staying right here.

179
00:10:11,144 --> 00:10:12,978
So, uh...

180
00:10:12,980 --> 00:10:15,280
You think Bunny goes out
on dates?

181
00:10:15,282 --> 00:10:17,882
Bunny Cote? Yeah.

182
00:10:17,884 --> 00:10:19,250
Drugs, she fucks everybody
in town.

183
00:10:19,252 --> 00:10:21,987
I know. I'm just saying.
I'm just saying, you know.

184
00:10:21,989 --> 00:10:24,789
I'll go to the movies
by myself.

185
00:10:24,791 --> 00:10:26,324
Hey, Drugs,

186
00:10:26,326 --> 00:10:29,260
if you had to say
who was your best friend,

187
00:10:29,262 --> 00:10:30,629
you would say me, right?

188
00:10:30,631 --> 00:10:32,664
No question.

189
00:10:32,666 --> 00:10:35,166
Yeah, if you blow me. Why?

190
00:10:35,168 --> 00:10:37,168
Nah, man. Come on.

191
00:10:37,170 --> 00:10:40,205
I need you to do something
for me.

192
00:10:40,207 --> 00:10:41,773
What?

193
00:10:41,775 --> 00:10:43,908
Well, you got to say yes first.

194
00:10:43,910 --> 00:10:46,191
All right, yes. Now what?

195
00:10:47,914 --> 00:10:49,080
All right.

196
00:10:49,082 --> 00:10:51,016
I know it's a pain in the ass,

197
00:10:51,018 --> 00:10:53,785
but you got to help Jackie with
the paper route while I'm gone.

198
00:10:53,787 --> 00:10:56,421
Just while I'm gone, Drugs.

199
00:10:58,225 --> 00:10:59,891
Is it the morning paper?

200
00:10:59,893 --> 00:11:01,693
<i>That was the difference</i>
<i>between Drugs</i>

201
00:11:01,695 --> 00:11:03,862
<i>and the rest of the guys.</i>
<i>He was more reliable.</i>

202
00:11:03,864 --> 00:11:05,830
<i>If he gave you his word,</i>

203
00:11:05,832 --> 00:11:07,899
<i>there was a fifty-fifty chance</i>
<i>he'd come through.</i>

204
00:11:07,901 --> 00:11:09,934
Here's 30 frog pelts for you.

205
00:11:09,936 --> 00:11:12,771
Oh, and please don't thank me.
It's just a loan.

206
00:11:12,773 --> 00:11:16,207
Don't give me that look, Dildo.

207
00:11:16,209 --> 00:11:18,877
You're one lucky bastard,
and you don't know it.

208
00:11:18,879 --> 00:11:21,179
What I wouldn't give
for an opportunity like this

209
00:11:21,181 --> 00:11:23,348
when I was a kid, and your first
homework assignment

210
00:11:23,350 --> 00:11:24,983
is to write a letter to Cavwich

211
00:11:24,985 --> 00:11:26,786
and thank him for getting you
into this place.

212
00:11:26,787 --> 00:11:28,119
And don't forget
what the judge said.

213
00:11:28,121 --> 00:11:32,090
You don't graduate,
it's one year in Socko.

214
00:11:32,092 --> 00:11:35,326
Heh. Prep school don't sound
so bad now, huh, Dildo?

215
00:11:38,465 --> 00:11:40,832
Take it easy, Dunph.

216
00:11:40,834 --> 00:11:43,935
Yeah, you too, Jackie.

217
00:11:43,937 --> 00:11:45,737
- All right. Come on.
- Let's go.

218
00:11:45,739 --> 00:11:47,372
You're gonna miss the bus.

219
00:11:50,444 --> 00:11:53,445
Hey, Dunph. The Jets game.

220
00:11:53,447 --> 00:11:55,080
Don't forget.

221
00:11:55,082 --> 00:11:56,347
Yeah, all right.

222
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,816
- All right.
- Come on. Come on.

223
00:12:03,090 --> 00:12:06,391
<i>¶ And if it's bad ¶</i>

224
00:12:06,393 --> 00:12:09,427
<i>¶ Don't let it get you down ¶</i>

225
00:12:09,429 --> 00:12:12,931
<i>¶ You can take it ¶</i>

226
00:12:12,933 --> 00:12:14,766
<i>My old man always wondered</i>

227
00:12:14,768 --> 00:12:17,001
<i>if Cavwich really had</i>
<i>the connections he said he did.</i>

228
00:12:17,003 --> 00:12:18,336
<i>I guess there was no doubt</i>

229
00:12:18,338 --> 00:12:20,004
<i>after what happened</i>
<i>with the judge</i>

230
00:12:20,006 --> 00:12:22,440
<i>and me getting into this place.</i>

231
00:12:22,442 --> 00:12:24,242
<i>Thanks a lot, Cavwich.</i>

232
00:12:24,244 --> 00:12:27,045
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

233
00:12:27,047 --> 00:12:29,481
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

234
00:12:29,483 --> 00:12:32,117
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

235
00:12:32,119 --> 00:12:35,086
<i>¶ Hold your head high ¶</i>

236
00:12:35,088 --> 00:12:37,789
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

237
00:12:37,791 --> 00:12:40,391
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

238
00:12:40,393 --> 00:12:43,228
<i>¶ Hold your head up, woman ¶</i>

239
00:12:43,230 --> 00:12:46,765
<i>¶ Hold your head high ¶</i>

240
00:13:15,862 --> 00:13:16,828
Mr. Dunphy.

241
00:13:21,401 --> 00:13:22,967
Right this way.

242
00:13:22,969 --> 00:13:26,070
I'm Mr. Funderburk,
your dorm master.

243
00:13:26,072 --> 00:13:28,873
These are the rules.

244
00:13:28,875 --> 00:13:31,876
Listen carefully.

245
00:13:31,878 --> 00:13:35,180
No smoking, no drinking,
no drugs, no sex,

246
00:13:35,182 --> 00:13:38,283
no cheating, no lying,
no gambling, no matches.

247
00:13:38,285 --> 00:13:40,418
No shit?

248
00:13:40,420 --> 00:13:42,987
No swearing.

249
00:13:42,989 --> 00:13:45,256
No showering after dinner.

250
00:13:45,258 --> 00:13:47,959
Be in your room by 10 p.m.,
lights out at 10:30,

251
00:13:47,961 --> 00:13:50,161
and no locks allowed
on the door.

252
00:13:50,163 --> 00:13:52,063
Don't go into town
without written permission.

253
00:13:52,065 --> 00:13:53,965
There are many other rules.

254
00:13:53,967 --> 00:13:57,101
Here's your handbook. Study it.

255
00:13:57,103 --> 00:13:58,904
If you get caught breaking
any of those rules,

256
00:13:58,905 --> 00:14:01,840
you'll be stung with work hours
after class.

257
00:14:09,516 --> 00:14:11,249
Hey.

258
00:14:11,251 --> 00:14:14,152
Fonzie. Where you going?

259
00:14:16,890 --> 00:14:18,223
The assembly.

260
00:14:18,225 --> 00:14:19,505
Like that?

261
00:14:27,934 --> 00:14:30,902
Thanks, man.

262
00:14:30,904 --> 00:14:32,537
Settle down, people.

263
00:14:32,539 --> 00:14:35,306
Settle down. Settle down.
Settle down.

264
00:14:35,308 --> 00:14:37,342
Today,

265
00:14:37,344 --> 00:14:43,214
we commence Cornwall Academy's
82nd year of existence.

266
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:45,316
Boring.

267
00:14:45,318 --> 00:14:49,287
In the past 10 years,
other institutions of our ilk

268
00:14:49,289 --> 00:14:54,158
have chosen to liberalize
their curriculum.

269
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:57,195
While these other institutions

270
00:14:57,197 --> 00:15:00,999
have grown to expect less
from their students,

271
00:15:01,001 --> 00:15:04,335
we here at Cornwall
expect more.

272
00:15:04,337 --> 00:15:07,272
Now, you new students
might not fully understand

273
00:15:07,274 --> 00:15:10,041
exactly what
this commitment means.

274
00:15:10,043 --> 00:15:12,410
So I will leave you now

275
00:15:12,412 --> 00:15:16,948
while Mr. Funderburk chooses
a returning student

276
00:15:16,950 --> 00:15:21,619
to rise and recite
our school fight song.

277
00:15:23,323 --> 00:15:25,456
Welcome.

278
00:15:25,458 --> 00:15:27,025
Funderjerk.

279
00:15:35,302 --> 00:15:37,535
Mr. Irving Waltham.

280
00:15:37,537 --> 00:15:39,337
Jizz!

281
00:15:39,339 --> 00:15:43,508
Would you please rise and sing
for us the school fight song?

282
00:15:43,510 --> 00:15:45,576
Go, Jizz!

283
00:15:52,052 --> 00:15:53,613
He looks like he's gonna
piss his pants.

284
00:15:55,989 --> 00:15:58,189
¶ As... ¶

285
00:15:58,191 --> 00:16:01,159
¶ We stand tall ¶

286
00:16:01,161 --> 00:16:04,963
¶ At old Cornwall ¶

287
00:16:04,965 --> 00:16:09,200
¶ Our spirits tried and true ¶

288
00:16:09,202 --> 00:16:13,404
¶ Our minds are strong ¶

289
00:16:13,406 --> 00:16:16,975
"Our spirits tried and true."

290
00:16:16,977 --> 00:16:20,445
¶ Our spirits tried and true ¶

291
00:16:23,350 --> 00:16:26,584
It seems Mr. Waltham
has forgotten the words.

292
00:16:26,586 --> 00:16:28,386
No, I...

293
00:16:28,388 --> 00:16:29,721
¶ Our spirits... ¶

294
00:16:29,723 --> 00:16:32,757
Gentlemen, who here thinks

295
00:16:32,759 --> 00:16:34,692
that we should extend
to Mr. Waltham

296
00:16:34,694 --> 00:16:37,261
the proper motivation

297
00:16:37,263 --> 00:16:41,032
so that he will never again
forget the school fight song?

298
00:16:41,034 --> 00:16:43,601
No, I know the song! Stop!

299
00:16:43,603 --> 00:16:45,444
Put me down. I know the song!

300
00:16:48,308 --> 00:16:50,375
¶ Our minds are strong ¶

301
00:16:50,377 --> 00:16:52,076
¶ Our work days long ¶

302
00:16:52,078 --> 00:16:55,279
¶ Our toils we ere see through ¶

303
00:16:55,281 --> 00:16:58,683
Would you stop that, please?

304
00:16:58,685 --> 00:17:00,618
Would you stop that, please?

305
00:17:00,620 --> 00:17:03,287
I'm trying to study.

306
00:17:03,289 --> 00:17:05,356
Yeah, me too.

307
00:17:05,358 --> 00:17:08,526
And this is the first thing
I want to learn.

308
00:17:08,528 --> 00:17:11,262
I'd take another peek at it
if I was you.

309
00:17:11,264 --> 00:17:13,197
I already told you.
I know that song.

310
00:17:13,199 --> 00:17:15,600
I got nervous. I do that.

311
00:17:15,602 --> 00:17:17,702
I get nervous.

312
00:17:17,704 --> 00:17:19,370
What are you studying
down there anyway?

313
00:17:19,372 --> 00:17:21,039
Class stuff.

314
00:17:21,041 --> 00:17:23,608
Classes don't start
until tomorrow, kid.

315
00:17:23,610 --> 00:17:25,076
You mean
you haven't started studying?

316
00:17:25,078 --> 00:17:27,278
Oh, man.
You're never gonna catch up.

317
00:17:29,082 --> 00:17:32,350
10:30. Lights out.

318
00:17:32,352 --> 00:17:35,386
Oh, okay. Give me five more
minutes with this thing.

319
00:17:35,388 --> 00:17:37,388
No, I already got
three hours tomorrow

320
00:17:37,390 --> 00:17:39,057
for not knowing
that stupid song.

321
00:17:39,059 --> 00:17:41,292
Okay, buddy, calm down.

322
00:17:49,803 --> 00:17:52,403
<i>I've never been apart</i>
<i>from my brother Jackie</i>

323
00:17:52,405 --> 00:17:54,539
<i>in my whole life, and already</i>
<i>I was starting to miss him.</i>

324
00:17:54,541 --> 00:17:56,741
<i>I felt kind of bad</i>

325
00:17:56,743 --> 00:17:59,744
<i>about the way I left things</i>
<i>at the bus station.</i>

326
00:17:59,746 --> 00:18:02,146
<i>I knew I wouldn't sleep</i>
<i>until I talked to him.</i>

327
00:18:02,148 --> 00:18:03,714
Ow.

328
00:18:03,716 --> 00:18:05,249
Sorry.

329
00:18:05,251 --> 00:18:07,285
What are you doing?

330
00:18:07,287 --> 00:18:08,786
I got to make a phone call.

331
00:18:08,788 --> 00:18:11,122
You can't make a phone call
after 10:00.

332
00:18:11,124 --> 00:18:13,624
Lights are out.

333
00:18:13,626 --> 00:18:16,160
That's it, man.

334
00:18:16,162 --> 00:18:20,331
Now you're gonna get stung.

335
00:18:20,333 --> 00:18:22,233
<i>Will you accept</i>
<i>a collect call from Tim?</i>

336
00:18:22,235 --> 00:18:24,202
<i>Tim Dunphy?</i> Yes.

337
00:18:24,204 --> 00:18:26,170
<i>For crissakes,</i>
<i>you just left today.</i>

338
00:18:26,172 --> 00:18:27,572
I gotta talk to Jackie.

339
00:18:27,574 --> 00:18:29,707
<i>Do you accept the call?</i>

340
00:18:29,709 --> 00:18:33,211
<i>- Come on. It's 11:00. You know</i>
<i>- I got to work tomorrow.</i>

341
00:18:33,213 --> 00:18:34,645
<i>I'm going</i>
<i>to disconnect you now.</i>

342
00:18:34,647 --> 00:18:36,547
Just tell Jackie
that I'll take him...

343
00:18:39,786 --> 00:18:41,352
...to the game.

344
00:18:48,361 --> 00:18:50,728
I told you you'd get stung.

345
00:18:50,730 --> 00:18:52,864
I hope your phone call
was worth it.

346
00:18:52,866 --> 00:18:54,765
Hey, Jizz. Catch.

347
00:18:54,767 --> 00:18:56,534
Ow! Unh.

348
00:18:56,536 --> 00:18:59,270
Hey! Hey!

349
00:18:59,272 --> 00:19:00,671
That's gonna leave a mark.

350
00:19:00,673 --> 00:19:02,673
My glasses.

351
00:19:04,277 --> 00:19:07,678
I can't... I can't find my...

352
00:19:16,756 --> 00:19:19,490
We got about 10 minutes till
Clusterfuck makes his rounds.

353
00:19:21,694 --> 00:19:26,197
<i>¶ Been 40 days</i>
<i>Since I don't know when ¶</i>

354
00:19:26,199 --> 00:19:29,400
<i>¶ I just saw her</i>
<i>With my best friend ¶</i>

355
00:19:29,402 --> 00:19:31,569
<i>¶ Do you know what I mean? ¶</i>

356
00:19:33,940 --> 00:19:37,475
Dunph, Billy Fu.
He's Middle Eastern.

357
00:19:39,946 --> 00:19:41,746
He's a good shit.

358
00:19:43,283 --> 00:19:45,750
Got the best reefer on campus.

359
00:19:47,187 --> 00:19:48,387
<i>¶ Do you know what I mean? ¶</i>

360
00:19:50,690 --> 00:19:53,257
<i>¶ Lord, do you know</i>
<i>What I mean? ¶</i>

361
00:20:06,506 --> 00:20:08,739
It's a barrel of laughs,
eh, Dunph?

362
00:20:08,741 --> 00:20:10,775
<i>¶ Do you know</i>
<i>Know what I mean? ¶</i>

363
00:20:12,478 --> 00:20:14,612
All righty, class.

364
00:20:17,350 --> 00:20:20,551
Who can tell me what X equals?

365
00:20:20,553 --> 00:20:24,822
Okay. Mr... Mr. Dunphy.

366
00:20:28,328 --> 00:20:30,328
Mr. Dunphy?

367
00:20:30,330 --> 00:20:33,564
Um...

368
00:20:33,566 --> 00:20:35,666
I think I'm in the wrong class.

369
00:20:35,668 --> 00:20:36,212
In 1933,

370
00:20:40,607 --> 00:20:44,609
who launched the New Deal?

371
00:20:46,779 --> 00:20:49,714
Mr. Dunphy.

372
00:20:49,716 --> 00:20:51,916
Mr. Dunphy?

373
00:20:51,918 --> 00:20:55,853
Who launched the New Deal?

374
00:20:55,855 --> 00:20:58,256
Um...

375
00:21:02,262 --> 00:21:04,295
What we're gonna do here today
is I'm gonna go around the room,

376
00:21:04,297 --> 00:21:05,930
and I'd like each of you
to name your favorite author.

377
00:21:05,932 --> 00:21:07,865
Hemingway. Salinger.

378
00:21:07,867 --> 00:21:09,700
Faulkner.

379
00:21:09,702 --> 00:21:10,968
Uh, Hamlet.

380
00:21:10,970 --> 00:21:12,637
Jack London.

381
00:21:12,639 --> 00:21:14,905
So, what are you doing
on Sunday afternoon?

382
00:21:14,907 --> 00:21:17,808
Summarizing the works
of William Shakespeare.

383
00:21:17,810 --> 00:21:20,845
Ohh. You should have gone
with Salinger,

384
00:21:20,847 --> 00:21:22,413
because he only wrote
a couple of books.

385
00:21:22,415 --> 00:21:23,848
Whoa, wait a second.

386
00:21:23,850 --> 00:21:25,683
<i>¶ Goddess on a mountaintop ¶</i>

387
00:21:25,685 --> 00:21:29,553
<i>¶ Burning like a silver flame ¶</i>

388
00:21:29,555 --> 00:21:32,690
<i>¶ The summit</i>
<i>Of beauty and love ¶</i>

00:21:34,360 --> 00:21:35,893
Who... Who's...

391
00:21:35,895 --> 00:21:37,862
What are you, an owl?

392
00:21:37,864 --> 00:21:39,664
Forget it.

393
00:21:40,767 --> 00:21:42,400
Her name's Jane Weston,

394
00:21:42,402 --> 00:21:43,934
hands down the coolest chick
in school.

395
00:21:43,936 --> 00:21:46,504
Forget it.

396
00:21:46,506 --> 00:21:48,372

397
00:21:48,374 --> 00:21:49,307

398
00:21:49,309 --> 00:21:50,908
Oh.

399
00:21:52,578 --> 00:21:55,079
Little help, please?

400
00:21:55,081 --> 00:21:56,580
Yeah.

401
00:22:08,394 --> 00:22:09,994
Thanks.

402
00:22:09,996 --> 00:22:12,596
Thanks.

403
00:22:12,598 --> 00:22:14,732
Mr. Dunphy,

404
00:22:14,734 --> 00:22:18,469
do you have
a friend called "Drugs"?

405
00:22:18,471 --> 00:22:21,539
Drugs Delaney?

406
00:22:21,541 --> 00:22:24,442
How many individuals
named "Drugs"

407
00:22:24,444 --> 00:22:26,577
could you possibly
associate with?

408
00:22:26,579 --> 00:22:29,914
Just one.

409
00:22:29,916 --> 00:22:33,984
Yesterday, we received a,
uh, a letter addressed simply

410
00:22:33,986 --> 00:22:38,055
to Cornwall Academy,
Cornwall, Connecticut.

411
00:22:38,057 --> 00:22:42,426
So, naturally, we, uh...
We opened it and read it.

412
00:22:42,428 --> 00:22:44,395
And...

413
00:22:44,397 --> 00:22:46,597
You might want to sit down.

414
00:22:47,834 --> 00:22:51,802
It begins, "Greetings, Dunph.

415
00:22:51,804 --> 00:22:53,804
"What's happening?

416
00:22:53,806 --> 00:22:57,742
"I got your letter today.

417
00:22:57,744 --> 00:23:01,112
"Cornhole Academy

00:23:01,114 --> 00:23:05,416

420
00:23:07,920 --> 00:23:11,689

423
00:23:17,029 --> 00:23:19,730
"You didn't want to go there
in the first place.

424
00:23:19,732 --> 00:23:22,032
"Eat shit, man.

425
00:23:22,034 --> 00:23:25,870
"Today, you should have
seen me and Mousy today

426
00:23:25,872 --> 00:23:28,472
at school today."

427
00:23:28,474 --> 00:23:31,509
We got cocked on a pint
of blackberry brandy,

428
00:23:31,511 --> 00:23:34,745
ate some THC on the bus.

429
00:23:34,747 --> 00:23:36,680
"We were fucked.

430
00:23:36,682 --> 00:23:39,450
This teacher, Mr. Rivera,
goes..."

431
00:23:39,452 --> 00:23:42,553
"What's wrong with you,
Delaney?"

432
00:23:42,555 --> 00:23:46,757
I go,
"I'm totally fucked, man!"

433
00:23:46,759 --> 00:23:50,961
"Everybody laughed
like a bastard."

434
00:23:50,963 --> 00:23:54,999
Oh, man. You should see
this song I'm listening to.

435
00:23:55,001 --> 00:23:59,136
"It's called 'Don't Bogart That
Joint, My Friend.'

436
00:23:59,138 --> 00:24:01,439
"I think it's by
a group called...

437
00:24:07,013 --> 00:24:09,713
"This is a couple
of hours later.

438
00:24:12,618 --> 00:24:16,086
Must have nodded out, man."

439
00:24:16,088 --> 00:24:19,056
I got to go 'cause I probably
definitely gonna nod out again.

440
00:24:19,058 --> 00:24:20,157
You want me to send you some...

441
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:22,159
"...squeef?

442
00:24:22,161 --> 00:24:24,762
"Or you got enough?

443
00:24:24,764 --> 00:24:27,064
"Good luck not getting caught.

444
00:24:27,066 --> 00:24:29,733
Cocked in Rhode Island."

445
00:24:29,735 --> 00:24:32,203
Drugs.

446
00:24:36,943 --> 00:24:40,711
Oh, yes, there's a postscript
you might be interested in.

447
00:24:40,713 --> 00:24:46,016
"Mousy says he stinkfingered
Bunny Cote."

448
00:24:47,787 --> 00:24:50,087
As you might imagine,
Mr. Dunphy,

449
00:24:50,089 --> 00:24:53,090
this is... This is...
This is fairly incriminating.

450
00:24:53,092 --> 00:24:55,926
And, uh, technically,

451
00:24:55,928 --> 00:24:58,729
you have not breached any
of Cornwall Academy's rules.

452
00:24:58,731 --> 00:25:01,866
But you can bet
your bottom dollar, mister,

453
00:25:01,868 --> 00:25:05,069
we're gonna be keeping
an eye on you.

454
00:25:17,583 --> 00:25:21,886
<i>¶ Well, the rain exploded</i>
<i>With a mighty crash ¶</i>

<i>¶ Band on the run ¶</i>

460
00:25:40,907 --> 00:25:42,806
Psst! Jackie!

461
00:25:42,808 --> 00:25:45,609
Don't worry,
the old man's in church.

462
00:25:48,681 --> 00:25:52,149
Where you been? The game's gonna
start pretty soon.

463
00:25:52,151 --> 00:25:55,686
Jackie, I've been thumbing
for two and a half hours.

464
00:25:55,688 --> 00:25:57,154
I'd get booted out
of that place

465
00:25:57,156 --> 00:25:58,656
if they knew I was doing this.

466
00:25:58,658 --> 00:26:00,124
You're giving me shit?

467
00:26:00,126 --> 00:26:02,826
Sorry.

468
00:26:02,828 --> 00:26:05,095
So how you doin'?

469
00:26:05,097 --> 00:26:08,265
Good.

470
00:26:08,267 --> 00:26:10,834
How's the old man treating
old Clapsy here?

471
00:26:10,836 --> 00:26:13,270
Still won't let her
in the house.

472
00:26:13,272 --> 00:26:16,206
How's he treating you?

473
00:26:16,208 --> 00:26:18,909
He's good. A little quiet.

474
00:26:18,911 --> 00:26:20,811
Hmm.

475
00:26:20,813 --> 00:26:22,947
You know what else?
I think he misses you.

476
00:26:22,949 --> 00:26:26,016
Heh. Really?

477
00:26:26,018 --> 00:26:28,085
Yeah, he talks about you
like you're dead or something.

478
00:26:28,087 --> 00:26:30,087
Hmm.

479
00:26:33,225 --> 00:26:35,506
Come on. Let's get out of here.

480
00:26:39,098 --> 00:26:42,900
So does it suck,
this school you're going to?

481
00:26:42,902 --> 00:26:44,935
No, it's all right.

482
00:26:44,937 --> 00:26:46,303
Really?

483
00:26:47,707 --> 00:26:50,608
Actually, it sucks. The big one.

484
00:26:50,610 --> 00:26:52,710
And this guy Funderburk hates me
like a bastard.

485
00:26:52,712 --> 00:26:53,844
I'm like the dumbest kid there

486
00:26:53,846 --> 00:26:56,814
and I gotta take
these retard classes.

487
00:26:56,816 --> 00:26:59,149
Come on.

488
00:26:59,151 --> 00:27:01,085
How come they're not stopping?

489
00:27:01,087 --> 00:27:02,853
Probably because
of the wheelchair, huh?

490
00:27:02,855 --> 00:27:05,322
Probably? No, Jackie,

491
00:27:05,324 --> 00:27:07,324
it's definitely
because of the wheelchair.

492
00:27:07,326 --> 00:27:09,293
Now quit your bitching
and let's move.

493
00:27:12,798 --> 00:27:15,065
<i>I never let Jackie</i>
<i>feel bad for himself</i>

494
00:27:15,067 --> 00:27:17,167
<i>because I wanted him to fit in.</i>

495
00:27:17,169 --> 00:27:20,137
<i>Nobody wants to be around</i>
<i>somebody they feel sorry for,</i>

496
00:27:20,139 --> 00:27:22,840
<i>so I treated him</i>
<i>like any other kid brother.</i>

497
00:27:27,880 --> 00:27:29,847
All right. Quit your clowning.

498
00:27:29,849 --> 00:27:31,148
Come on.

499
00:27:36,022 --> 00:27:37,988
How you doing? What's up?

500
00:27:37,990 --> 00:27:40,057
Listen.

501
00:27:40,059 --> 00:27:42,326
I got my crippled
kid brother over there,

502
00:27:42,328 --> 00:27:43,327
and he's a big Namath fan.

503
00:27:43,329 --> 00:27:46,063
And I was just wondering

504
00:27:46,065 --> 00:27:47,831
if maybe you could get us
onto the field.

505
00:27:49,869 --> 00:27:52,036
Tell you what. I can't
get you out on the field,

506
00:27:52,038 --> 00:27:54,838
but I got standing room only
up on the second level.

507
00:27:54,840 --> 00:27:56,306
Bring him right through here.

508
00:27:56,308 --> 00:27:58,876
Thank you so much.

509
00:27:58,878 --> 00:28:00,711
You ready? Yeah.

510
00:28:00,713 --> 00:28:02,833
All right, ham it up, okay?

511
00:28:05,151 --> 00:28:07,751
Thank you.

<i>¶ I gotta know</i>

520
00:28:34,714 --> 00:28:35,979
I liked the school.

521
00:28:35,981 --> 00:28:37,781
I just don't know
if it's right for me.

522
00:28:37,783 --> 00:28:39,750
The whole way it was presented,
you know?

523
00:28:39,752 --> 00:28:42,920
Well, my vote says you can't
go wrong with Dartmouth.

524
00:28:42,922 --> 00:28:45,289
Who says I can even
get in to Dartmouth?

525
00:28:45,291 --> 00:28:48,258
You get your boards up a little,
you'll get in.

526
00:28:48,260 --> 00:28:50,461
What about you?

527
00:28:50,463 --> 00:28:52,229
Tim.

528
00:28:52,231 --> 00:28:53,997
Where are you going next year?

529
00:28:53,999 --> 00:28:56,467
I'm thinking, like, college.

530
00:28:59,505 --> 00:29:01,271
Any particular college?

531
00:29:02,842 --> 00:29:04,408
Yeah, probably.

532
00:29:14,286 --> 00:29:16,487
I'll be right back.

533
00:29:16,489 --> 00:29:19,356
Fill it up.

534
00:29:19,358 --> 00:29:21,792
<i>¶ Well, I'm a-runnin'</i>
<i>Down the road ¶</i>

535
00:29:21,794 --> 00:29:23,327
<i>¶ Trying to loosen my load ¶</i>

536
00:29:23,329 --> 00:29:26,997
<i>¶ Got a world of trouble</i>
<i>On my mind ¶</i>

537
00:29:26,999 --> 00:29:28,465
<i>¶ Lookin' for a lover ¶</i>

538
00:29:28,467 --> 00:29:30,801
I got an extra one just in case
you wanted one.

539
00:29:30,803 --> 00:29:32,169
Oh, thanks.

540
00:29:32,171 --> 00:29:33,437
Yeah.

541
00:29:34,840 --> 00:29:37,908
Mmm. What is this?

542
00:29:40,246 --> 00:29:44,148
<i>¶ Don't let the sound</i>
<i>Of your own wheels ¶</i>

543
00:29:44,150 --> 00:29:47,351
<i>¶ Make you crazy ¶</i>

544
00:29:47,353 --> 00:29:50,454
<i>¶ Come on, baby ¶</i>

545
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:54,124
<i>¶ Don't say maybe ¶</i>

546
00:29:54,126 --> 00:29:57,795
<i>¶ I got to know</i>
<i>If your sweet love ¶</i>

547
00:29:57,797 --> 00:30:01,198
<i>¶ Is gonna save me ¶</i>

548
00:30:01,200 --> 00:30:03,100
Here we are.

549
00:30:08,808 --> 00:30:10,974
Thanks for the Coke.

550
00:30:10,976 --> 00:30:13,210
Good luck.

551
00:30:13,212 --> 00:30:14,578
- Appreciate the ride.
- No trouble at all.

552
00:30:14,580 --> 00:30:17,347
Nice to meet you, Jane.

553
00:30:17,349 --> 00:30:19,049
You too.

554
00:30:19,051 --> 00:30:21,418
<i>¶ Oh, we got it easy ¶</i>

555
00:30:24,056 --> 00:30:27,991
Billy Fu?
What are you doing up here?

556
00:30:27,993 --> 00:30:30,460
Isn't this Home Ec
with Perkins?

557
00:30:30,462 --> 00:30:32,029
Yeah.

558
00:30:32,031 --> 00:30:33,964
I'm in this class.

559
00:30:33,966 --> 00:30:35,933
I heard we were making
chocolate-chip cookies today.

560
00:30:35,935 --> 00:30:38,068
But, uh,

561
00:30:38,070 --> 00:30:40,871
I'm going to make brownies.

562
00:30:42,274 --> 00:30:44,308
Well, where you been, huh?

563
00:30:44,310 --> 00:30:45,943
Term's half over.

564
00:30:45,945 --> 00:30:48,612
I've been taking it easy,
you know?

565
00:30:48,614 --> 00:30:52,950
You see, my father,
he donate $5 million to school,

566
00:30:52,952 --> 00:30:55,586
and, of course, they don't see
one Yankee dime

567
00:30:55,588 --> 00:30:58,288
until I graduate.

568
00:30:59,892 --> 00:31:02,526
My father's a very sharp
cookie, eh, Dunph?

569
00:31:02,528 --> 00:31:04,027
Very sharp.

570
00:31:07,433 --> 00:31:11,268
My mother thought
you were so funny.

571
00:31:11,270 --> 00:31:12,603
She did?

572
00:31:12,605 --> 00:31:15,572
He said he wants to go
to college in Arizona

573
00:31:15,574 --> 00:31:17,274
because it's on the water.

574
00:31:18,577 --> 00:31:20,911
My father thought
he was dead serious.

575
00:31:20,913 --> 00:31:22,946
Oh, you got them pretty good.

576
00:31:22,948 --> 00:31:24,882
Oh, yeah, they were cracking up

577
00:31:24,884 --> 00:31:26,950
all the way
to the girls' school.

578
00:31:26,952 --> 00:31:30,087
Anyway, I got to get going.
See you around, Wheeler.

579
00:31:30,089 --> 00:31:32,089
Bye, Jim.

580
00:31:33,259 --> 00:31:35,225
Bye, Jane.

581
00:31:37,897 --> 00:31:39,930
I don't get it.

582
00:31:39,932 --> 00:31:44,034
You tell me how Arizona
is not on the water.

583
00:31:44,036 --> 00:31:47,137
Dunph, that gray border
down there,

584
00:31:47,139 --> 00:31:49,659
that's not water.
That's Mexico.

585
00:31:50,910 --> 00:31:53,477
Still?

586
00:31:53,479 --> 00:31:56,179
Well, what the fuck was
the Alamo for?

587
00:31:56,181 --> 00:31:58,415
Look, Dunph,

588
00:31:58,417 --> 00:32:00,651
I went through
the same kind of thing

589
00:32:00,653 --> 00:32:02,586
a couple of summers ago.

590
00:32:02,588 --> 00:32:04,554
There was this girl
at camp I liked.

591
00:32:04,556 --> 00:32:06,256
At first,
she was really nice to me,

592
00:32:06,258 --> 00:32:08,499
then suddenly, she wouldn't even
give me the time of day.

593
00:32:12,498 --> 00:32:13,964
This is her.

594
00:32:16,001 --> 00:32:17,701
Wow.

595
00:32:17,703 --> 00:32:21,672
S-S-She's...
She's something, Irv.

596
00:32:24,243 --> 00:32:27,544
Unfortunately, she knows it.

597
00:32:41,260 --> 00:32:43,660
Hey. Hey.

598
00:32:50,502 --> 00:32:52,302
Do you always do that?

599
00:32:52,304 --> 00:32:53,603
What?

600
00:32:53,605 --> 00:32:56,540
Uh, wash your pillow.

601
00:32:59,345 --> 00:33:01,411
Yeah, sometimes.

602
00:33:01,413 --> 00:33:03,380
When I'm in the mood.

603
00:33:07,619 --> 00:33:10,654
Toms Brook, Virginia. Wow.

604
00:33:12,224 --> 00:33:14,624
That sounds like
a pretty cool place to be from.

605
00:33:14,626 --> 00:33:16,560
Yeah, it is.

606
00:33:18,697 --> 00:33:21,631
It must be beautiful. Oh, yeah.

607
00:33:26,372 --> 00:33:29,773
So, what do people do around
here for fun? On the weekend?

608
00:33:29,775 --> 00:33:32,075
There's not much to do.

609
00:33:32,077 --> 00:33:33,744
You can go up in the woods
and get high.

610
00:33:33,746 --> 00:33:36,013
That's about it.

611
00:33:41,453 --> 00:33:44,021
So tell me about Pawtucket,
Jim.

612
00:33:44,023 --> 00:33:45,689
What do you want to know,
Betty?

613
00:33:45,691 --> 00:33:47,224
Betty?

614
00:33:47,226 --> 00:33:49,192
Tim.

615
00:33:49,194 --> 00:33:51,728
Oh! Heh. I'm sorry.

616
00:33:53,432 --> 00:33:56,266
Heh. Wow.

617
00:33:56,268 --> 00:33:59,536
This is good weed.
Yeah, it's homegrown.

618
00:33:59,538 --> 00:34:02,639
A friend of mine, in Pawtucket,

619
00:34:02,641 --> 00:34:07,577
every day he soaks
the weed in bug spray

620
00:34:07,579 --> 00:34:10,814
so when you smoking it,
you're also getting insecticide,

621
00:34:10,816 --> 00:34:13,057
which is a pretty good buzz
on its own.

622
00:34:14,686 --> 00:34:18,321
Have you smoked
insecticide on its own?

623
00:34:18,323 --> 00:34:20,791
Yeah, right? What am I, stupid?

624
00:34:20,793 --> 00:34:23,353
I'm gonna smoke
a deadly poison?

625
00:34:33,705 --> 00:34:37,207
<i>¶ No matter what you are ¶</i>

626
00:34:37,209 --> 00:34:38,775
Dunph!

627
00:34:38,777 --> 00:34:42,145
One, two...

628
00:34:42,147 --> 00:34:44,147
<i>¶ Doesn't matter what you do ¶</i>

629
00:34:44,149 --> 00:34:46,083
Three!

630
00:34:46,085 --> 00:34:48,418
That was very straight.
Good job.

631
00:34:50,456 --> 00:34:53,757
<i>¶ No matter what you do ¶</i>

632
00:34:54,860 --> 00:34:58,862
<i>¶ I will always be around ¶</i>

633
00:34:58,864 --> 00:35:02,265
<i>¶ Won't you tell me</i>
<i>What you found now ¶</i>

634
00:35:03,769 --> 00:35:06,770
"At your pardon,
I will myself..."

635
00:35:10,275 --> 00:35:12,309
Hey.

636
00:35:12,311 --> 00:35:13,610
Dunph.

637
00:35:13,612 --> 00:35:16,480
<i>¶ Be a part of it all ¶</i>

638
00:35:16,482 --> 00:35:18,849
Aah!

639
00:35:18,851 --> 00:35:20,550
<i>¶ Nothing to see ¶</i>

640
00:35:20,552 --> 00:35:23,653
<i>¶ Nothing would be ¶</i>

641
00:35:23,655 --> 00:35:26,356
<i>¶ No matter where you go ¶</i>

642
00:35:35,234 --> 00:35:36,900
What's this?

643
00:35:36,902 --> 00:35:38,835
Read it.

644
00:35:45,744 --> 00:35:47,144
Brown University?

645
00:35:47,146 --> 00:35:48,778
They got one of these
in Providence, you know.

646
00:35:48,780 --> 00:35:51,648
There's only one, Dunph.
Just read it.

647
00:35:54,887 --> 00:35:58,688
"After reviewing
your application for admission,

648
00:35:58,690 --> 00:36:01,725
I am pleased
to inform you that you..."

649
00:36:04,829 --> 00:36:06,729
"...have been accepted
to the graduating class

650
00:36:06,732 --> 00:36:08,832
of 1979 at Brown University."

651
00:36:08,834 --> 00:36:10,800
Yes.

652
00:36:10,802 --> 00:36:13,904
"Sincerely,
Jonathan S. Rogers Jr."

653
00:36:13,906 --> 00:36:16,640
So am I gonna
like Providence, Dunph?

654
00:36:21,747 --> 00:36:24,181
Yeah, we're gonna love it.

655
00:36:24,183 --> 00:36:25,315
"We're gonna love it"? Yeah.

656
00:36:25,317 --> 00:36:26,597
Okay.

657
00:36:28,453 --> 00:36:30,320
This is... This is great.

658
00:36:30,322 --> 00:36:32,622
Congratulations.

659
00:36:32,624 --> 00:36:34,457
Thank you.

660
00:36:37,696 --> 00:36:40,230
Mr. Dunphy.

661
00:36:40,232 --> 00:36:42,499
A word.

662
00:36:45,304 --> 00:36:47,704
Congratulations, Mr. Dunphy.

663
00:36:47,706 --> 00:36:50,407
You've broken another record
here at Cornwall.

664
00:36:50,409 --> 00:36:53,243
<i>You've got more hours</i>
<i>to work off</i>

665
00:36:53,245 --> 00:36:55,912
<i>than you've got time left</i>
<i>in the semester.</i>

666
00:36:55,914 --> 00:36:58,481
I can't be late to practice.

667
00:36:58,483 --> 00:37:00,283
Yo, wait up.

668
00:37:00,285 --> 00:37:04,521
Okay, ladies, on our feet.
Chop, chop.

669
00:37:04,523 --> 00:37:07,591
Jenkins and Martin,
four more hours each.

670
00:37:07,593 --> 00:37:08,959
How about that?

671
00:37:08,961 --> 00:37:10,927
What, is something funny,
gentlemen?

672
00:37:10,929 --> 00:37:13,363
Let's make it five,
all right? Five hours each.

673
00:37:13,365 --> 00:37:15,699
I do love the fall.

674
00:37:15,701 --> 00:37:17,901
It gives us so much work to do,
doesn't it?

675
00:37:17,903 --> 00:37:20,637
Five hours. Jenkins.

676
00:37:29,581 --> 00:37:32,449
<i>¶ She cried</i>
<i>To the southern wind ¶</i>

677
00:37:32,451 --> 00:37:35,318

678
00:37:35,320 --> 00:37:37,988
Thanks very much, gentlemen.

679
00:37:37,990 --> 00:37:40,590
Always nice
doing business with you.

¶<i> Headin' for a showdown ¶</i>

681
00:37:45,631 --> 00:37:47,931
Fire!
Fire in Funderburk's room!

682
00:37:47,933 --> 00:37:49,799
Someone call
the fire department!

683
00:37:49,801 --> 00:37:52,435

685
00:37:56,942 --> 00:37:59,342
Ow! Ow! God!

<i>¶ There's gonna be a showdown ¶</i>

687
00:38:03,782 --> 00:38:05,915
Fire! Fire!

688
00:38:05,917 --> 00:38:10,287
Look at my hand.
Explain how I burnt my hand.

689
00:38:10,289 --> 00:38:12,455
It was hot, Bill.
I'm telling you it was hot.

690
00:38:12,457 --> 00:38:15,458
Well, I...
What was I supposed to do?

691
00:38:19,431 --> 00:38:22,065
<i>Roger. That's a false alarm</i>
<i>at Cornwall...</i>

692
00:38:22,067 --> 00:38:25,435
This was not a false alarm.

693
00:38:25,437 --> 00:38:28,505
¶<i> She came to me like a friend ¶</i>

694
00:38:28,507 --> 00:38:33,310

697
00:39:03,075 --> 00:39:04,774
Good night.

698
00:39:09,614 --> 00:39:12,515
You should call her, Irv.

699
00:39:12,517 --> 00:39:15,785
What do you mean?

700
00:39:15,787 --> 00:39:18,788
I mean you should go see
her over the holidays.

701
00:39:18,790 --> 00:39:21,358
Maybe she's changed.
Maybe she's nice again.

702
00:39:21,360 --> 00:39:23,893
She hasn't changed.

703
00:39:27,933 --> 00:39:30,533
There was this kid whose cousin
went to Cornwall.

704
00:39:30,535 --> 00:39:32,836
He told her.

705
00:39:32,838 --> 00:39:36,673
You know?
That they call me Jizz.

706
00:39:36,675 --> 00:39:39,509
So? Big whoop.

707
00:39:39,511 --> 00:39:42,512
A friend of mine from Pawtucket,
they call him Dingleberry.

708
00:39:42,514 --> 00:39:45,048
This guy gets more beaver
than the Hoover Dam.

709
00:39:48,620 --> 00:39:52,422
You know, when I first
came here, I did all right.

710
00:39:52,424 --> 00:39:55,992
I almost ran for class treasurer
my freshman year.

711
00:39:55,994 --> 00:39:59,963
Then they asked me
to join a secret club.

712
00:39:59,965 --> 00:40:03,566
Only five freshmen they asked,
and I was one of them.

713
00:40:05,537 --> 00:40:08,705
This year, you five are honored
to be the chosen ones.

714
00:40:08,707 --> 00:40:12,041
This brotherhood was formed
to protect one another,

715
00:40:12,043 --> 00:40:15,945
to aid each other
both academically and socially,

716
00:40:15,947 --> 00:40:21,718
to shield each other from
embarrassment and humiliation.

717
00:40:21,720 --> 00:40:25,655
Are you willing to come with us
into the sacred fold?

718
00:40:25,657 --> 00:40:27,957
Yes.

719
00:40:27,959 --> 00:40:30,894
Therefore,
to bind ourselves together,

720
00:40:30,896 --> 00:40:33,930
we must bear witness
to one another's humiliation.

721
00:40:33,932 --> 00:40:36,065
When I blow out this candle,

722
00:40:36,067 --> 00:40:38,568
we'll all drop trou

723
00:40:38,570 --> 00:40:40,537
and commence to jack off
till each of us hath come.

724
00:40:40,539 --> 00:40:43,540
This should serve as the glue
that binds us together

725
00:40:43,542 --> 00:40:45,942
as right-hand men
from this day forward,

726
00:40:45,944 --> 00:40:51,748
November 13th
in the year of our Lord 1971.

727
00:40:53,018 --> 00:40:54,184
We shall now begin.

728
00:41:16,208 --> 00:41:18,775
<i>Jizz! Jizz! Jizz! Jizz!</i>

729
00:41:25,016 --> 00:41:27,984
- You got tricked.
- Who gives a fuck?

730
00:41:27,986 --> 00:41:30,820
You flogged the dolphin, that
ain't a federal offense.

731
00:41:30,822 --> 00:41:33,156
Around here it is. Bullshit!

732
00:41:34,893 --> 00:41:38,795
You know that 99 percent
of all teenage guys beat off?

733
00:41:38,797 --> 00:41:40,697
Really?

734
00:41:40,699 --> 00:41:42,832
Yeah, 99 percent.
And something like

735
00:41:42,834 --> 00:41:45,735
4 percent of most girls too.

736
00:41:45,737 --> 00:41:47,737
Everyone on this hall beats off.

737
00:41:47,739 --> 00:41:50,240
Like you mean, even you, Dunph?

738
00:41:50,242 --> 00:41:53,276
Well, no, I don't.

739
00:41:53,278 --> 00:41:55,278
Not personally, I don't, but...

740
00:41:58,083 --> 00:42:01,584
I mean, if you read the
research, it's very common.

741
00:42:09,628 --> 00:42:11,661
<i>We didn't have</i>
<i>a White Christmas that year,</i>

742
00:42:11,663 --> 00:42:13,530
<i>but it was good</i>
<i>to be home anyway.</i>

743
00:42:13,532 --> 00:42:15,665
<i>Even my old man and his friends</i>
<i>seemed to be in better spirits</i>

744
00:42:15,667 --> 00:42:17,567
<i>around the holidays.</i>

745
00:42:17,569 --> 00:42:19,168
Unless you're gonna pay
for him,

746
00:42:19,170 --> 00:42:20,837
shut the fuck up
and let him play his own cards.

747
00:42:20,839 --> 00:42:23,106
Just wake up, will you, please?

748
00:42:23,108 --> 00:42:25,108
It's like playing with
fucking Gomer Pyle over here.

749
00:42:25,110 --> 00:42:27,043
He's queer, you know.

750
00:42:27,045 --> 00:42:28,811
Who's queer?

751
00:42:28,813 --> 00:42:31,114
The Gomer Pyle guy, Jim Nabors.

752
00:42:31,116 --> 00:42:34,217
Him and that Rock Hudson,
they're queers together.

753
00:42:34,219 --> 00:42:36,619
Did you go to school
on the short bus?

754
00:42:36,621 --> 00:42:38,855
Rock Hudson is not queer.

755
00:42:38,857 --> 00:42:40,924
Is too, him and that Nabors.

756
00:42:40,926 --> 00:42:42,992
He could be.
He's a good singer, that Nabors.

757
00:42:44,563 --> 00:42:46,963
Hey, hey, hey.

758
00:42:46,965 --> 00:42:50,166
What, you don't tell your
old man what's going on no more?

759
00:42:50,168 --> 00:42:52,101
What are you two
knuckleheads doing?

760
00:42:52,103 --> 00:42:53,703
Going out.

761
00:42:53,705 --> 00:42:55,204
And what are you gonna do?

762
00:42:55,206 --> 00:42:56,272
Hang around.

763
00:42:56,274 --> 00:42:58,074
And when are you coming back?

764
00:42:58,076 --> 00:42:59,609
Later.

765
00:42:59,611 --> 00:43:01,110
There. Was that so hard?

766
00:43:03,114 --> 00:43:06,349
Heh. I like to give it to 'em.
Bastards.

767
00:43:06,351 --> 00:43:09,085
Isn't he dead, that Gomer Pyle?

768
00:43:09,087 --> 00:43:10,653
I don't think so.

769
00:43:10,655 --> 00:43:13,089
Are you sure?
Hoss Cartwright's dead.

770
00:43:13,091 --> 00:43:15,692
Will you shut the fuck up?

771
00:43:15,694 --> 00:43:18,127
Hoss Cartwright's dead?

772
00:43:18,129 --> 00:43:22,932
<i>¶ We get it on</i>
<i>Most every night ¶</i>

773
00:43:22,934 --> 00:43:26,235
<i>¶ When that moon gets big</i>
<i>And bright ¶</i>

774
00:43:26,237 --> 00:43:30,106
So, Dunph, you getting any
up there?

775
00:43:30,108 --> 00:43:33,176
Well, there's this one girl.
She's pretty cool.

776
00:43:33,178 --> 00:43:34,944
How's her helmet?

777
00:43:34,946 --> 00:43:36,679
Incredible.

778
00:43:36,681 --> 00:43:38,181
Prettiest girl in the school.

779
00:43:38,183 --> 00:43:39,215
Her toilet?

780
00:43:39,217 --> 00:43:40,883
Perfect.

781
00:43:40,885 --> 00:43:42,285
Big fun bags?

782
00:43:42,287 --> 00:43:44,320
Nah, but nice ones.

783
00:43:44,322 --> 00:43:45,888
Are you porking her?

784
00:43:45,890 --> 00:43:47,991
No.

785
00:43:47,993 --> 00:43:50,293
I don't even care
if I bang her.

786
00:43:50,295 --> 00:43:52,362
It don't matter.

787
00:43:52,364 --> 00:43:54,263
I like her.

788
00:43:54,265 --> 00:43:57,233
Come on, what do you mean
it don't matter?

789
00:43:57,235 --> 00:43:59,702
I mean... No, I'm just saying,

790
00:43:59,704 --> 00:44:02,872
You can treat her like a guy.

791
00:44:02,874 --> 00:44:06,909
What, you mean, she don't freak
out if you bust her balls?

792
00:44:06,911 --> 00:44:11,014
No, not at all.
She's a good chick.

793
00:44:11,016 --> 00:44:14,083
Huh. She sounds like
a cool mule.

794
00:44:14,085 --> 00:44:16,219
You know, a real classy broad.

795
00:44:16,221 --> 00:44:17,887
Classy broad?

796
00:44:17,889 --> 00:44:19,288
You wouldn't know
a classy broad

797
00:44:19,290 --> 00:44:21,730
if she took a dump
on your head.

798
00:44:25,797 --> 00:44:27,930
Ah, I don't know.

799
00:44:27,932 --> 00:44:29,766
I mean, it just don't figure,
you know?

800
00:44:29,768 --> 00:44:31,768
Guy like Rock Hudson

801
00:44:31,770 --> 00:44:33,436
he could have any broad
in the world he wanted.

802
00:44:33,438 --> 00:44:36,172
Well you know what that is?
It's a sickness.

803
00:44:36,174 --> 00:44:38,908
It's a mental disturbance
caused by his mother.

804
00:44:38,910 --> 00:44:41,344
It's a sin is what it is,
period.

805
00:44:41,346 --> 00:44:43,913
Who gives a shit?
So he's gay. Big deal.

806
00:44:43,915 --> 00:44:47,216
Big deal? What's that mean,
"big deal"?

807
00:44:47,218 --> 00:44:48,951
Why do you give a fuck anyway?

808
00:44:48,953 --> 00:44:51,154
Doesn't affect you.

809
00:44:51,156 --> 00:44:53,189
I mean, I could see
if Raquel Welch was lezzie.

810
00:44:53,191 --> 00:44:54,824
But what do you
give a shit about him?

811
00:44:54,826 --> 00:44:58,327
I just do. Why, you don't?

812
00:44:58,329 --> 00:45:00,863
No, I don't.

813
00:45:04,069 --> 00:45:06,803
Hey, well,
if that don't bother you,

814
00:45:06,805 --> 00:45:08,204
maybe you're a femme too.

815
00:45:08,206 --> 00:45:11,007
All right, already.
Somebody pick a card.

816
00:45:11,009 --> 00:45:13,476
Wait a second.
I gotta hear this now.

817
00:45:13,478 --> 00:45:15,912
I mean, we're laying our cards
on the thing here, right?

818
00:45:15,914 --> 00:45:20,383
Joey, do you or don't you

819
00:45:20,385 --> 00:45:22,785
take it in the jaw?

820
00:45:24,422 --> 00:45:26,889
Shut the fuck up
for fuck's sake!

821
00:45:26,891 --> 00:45:28,491
What? Wait a second!

822
00:45:28,493 --> 00:45:31,227
Guy's never been married.
You ever seen him with a broad?

823
00:45:33,732 --> 00:45:37,100
What if I was?
Would that change something?

824
00:45:37,102 --> 00:45:39,235
You afraid I'd come on to you
all of a sudden,

825
00:45:39,237 --> 00:45:41,270
start playing
grab-ass with you?

826
00:45:42,741 --> 00:45:45,241
Just answer the question, okay?

827
00:45:45,243 --> 00:45:48,745
Are you now,
or have you ever been,

828
00:45:48,747 --> 00:45:50,980
a gay?

829
00:46:00,258 --> 00:46:03,793
Yeah. Okay, yeah.

830
00:46:07,365 --> 00:46:11,868
He's fucking busting our balls.

831
00:46:11,870 --> 00:46:15,104
He means he's gay like,
different.

832
00:46:15,106 --> 00:46:16,906
Right?

833
00:46:19,110 --> 00:46:21,010
Is that it?

834
00:46:21,012 --> 00:46:23,446
I mean, "gay" is that
what you mean?

835
00:46:23,448 --> 00:46:25,448
"Gay," like different?

836
00:46:25,450 --> 00:46:28,551
Or "gay" like:

837
00:46:40,465 --> 00:46:43,166
Oh, I can't help you out there
at all.

838
00:46:43,168 --> 00:46:44,233
You're on your own.

839
00:46:48,573 --> 00:46:51,307
Get the fuck out of here!

840
00:46:57,482 --> 00:46:59,816
Anyone else got
any confessions?

841
00:47:11,496 --> 00:47:13,896
She moves pretty well
for a big woman.

842
00:47:16,000 --> 00:47:18,034
Not in the fucking house
with those things.

843
00:47:18,036 --> 00:47:19,556
How many times
do I got to tell you?

844
00:47:21,039 --> 00:47:22,171
That's what you get.

845
00:47:22,173 --> 00:47:24,207
Thanks for the album, Pop.

846
00:47:24,209 --> 00:47:25,308
I've been wanting this.

847
00:47:25,310 --> 00:47:27,410
That there's a double album,

848
00:47:27,412 --> 00:47:29,545
and it's from me
and Jackie too.

849
00:47:29,547 --> 00:47:32,882
Or Jackie and me, whatever.

850
00:47:32,884 --> 00:47:34,483
You're the student.
Which is it?

851
00:47:37,121 --> 00:47:39,255
Either one,

852
00:47:39,257 --> 00:47:41,297
so long as you're referring
to an object.

853
00:47:44,863 --> 00:47:46,229
Thanks, Jackie.

854
00:47:46,231 --> 00:47:48,631
God, she dropped
the thing there.

855
00:47:48,633 --> 00:47:50,533
You see that?

856
00:48:08,052 --> 00:48:11,387
<i>It was hard to think about</i>
<i>my mother at Christmastime.</i>

857
00:48:11,389 --> 00:48:15,291
<i>But it was even harder</i>
<i>not to think about her.</i>

858
00:48:18,396 --> 00:48:21,964
<i>¶ Well, way up north</i>
<i>Where the air gets cold ¶</i>

859
00:48:21,966 --> 00:48:23,566
<i>¶ There's a tale about</i>
<i>Christmas ¶</i>

860
00:48:23,568 --> 00:48:25,501
<i>That you've all been told ¶</i>

861
00:48:25,503 --> 00:48:28,971
¶<i> And a real famous cat</i>
<i>All dressed up in red ¶</i>

862
00:48:28,973 --> 00:48:32,341
<i>¶ And he spends the whole year</i>
<i>Working out on his sled ¶</i>

863
00:48:32,343 --> 00:48:34,543
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

864
00:48:36,347 --> 00:48:38,547
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

865
00:48:40,385 --> 00:48:43,552
<i>¶ Just a little bobsled</i>
<i>We call it old Saint Nick ¶</i>

866
00:48:43,554 --> 00:48:47,423
<i>¶ But she'll walk a toboggan</i>
<i>With a four-speed stick ¶</i>

867
00:48:47,425 --> 00:48:51,227
<i>¶ She's candy-apple red</i>
<i>With a ski for a wheel ¶</i>

868
00:48:51,229 --> 00:48:54,563
<i>¶ And when Santa gives her gas,</i>
<i>Man, just watch her peel ¶</i>

869
00:48:54,565 --> 00:48:56,432
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

870
00:48:58,236 --> 00:49:00,102
<i>¶ It's the little Saint Nick ¶</i>

871
00:49:02,073 --> 00:49:05,207
Having fun, Dildo?

872
00:49:05,209 --> 00:49:07,944
Yeah. Ah.
I can't do this tie thing.

873
00:49:07,946 --> 00:49:10,079
I feel like a retard at school

874
00:49:10,081 --> 00:49:12,515
wearing a clip-on. Everyone
else, they wear real ties.

875
00:49:12,517 --> 00:49:15,518
I look like a...
Look like a bozo.

876
00:49:15,520 --> 00:49:18,454
Relax. Just relax for a second.

877
00:49:18,456 --> 00:49:21,290
Here. Let me see this here.

878
00:49:21,292 --> 00:49:23,426
Necktie.

879
00:49:23,428 --> 00:49:26,395
Got the wide side,
you got the skinny side.

880
00:49:26,397 --> 00:49:28,698
Wide, left. Skinny, right.

881
00:49:28,700 --> 00:49:31,600
Now, count down
from the collar.

882
00:49:31,602 --> 00:49:35,304
One, two, three, four.

883
00:49:35,306 --> 00:49:37,306
Skinny side, you draw it down

884
00:49:37,308 --> 00:49:40,142
just below that fourth button,
all right?

885
00:49:40,144 --> 00:49:42,979
Now, take the wide side.

886
00:49:42,981 --> 00:49:46,148
You come over once, then under.

887
00:49:46,150 --> 00:49:47,616
Come over twice.

888
00:49:49,620 --> 00:49:51,253
You paying attention here?

889
00:49:51,255 --> 00:49:52,755
Yeah. Ahem.

890
00:49:52,756 --> 00:49:54,256
All right. You throw it over,
then you come through here.

891
00:49:54,258 --> 00:49:56,993
That hole, right?

892
00:49:56,995 --> 00:49:59,595
The worm comes
through the hole,

893
00:49:59,597 --> 00:50:02,298
then right down
into that little fold you made

894
00:50:02,300 --> 00:50:04,000
right there like that.
You see that?

895
00:50:04,002 --> 00:50:06,335
You're always keeping it tight,
all right?

896
00:50:06,337 --> 00:50:08,337
How old was she then?

897
00:50:12,643 --> 00:50:15,378
She was young.
I... I don't remember.

898
00:50:15,380 --> 00:50:17,079
Now pay attention here.

899
00:50:17,081 --> 00:50:18,614
Yeah.

900
00:50:18,615 --> 00:50:20,148
Keeping it tight,
nice and tight.

901
00:50:20,151 --> 00:50:21,450
Now, when you're done,

902
00:50:21,452 --> 00:50:23,452
if you've done
your job properly,

903
00:50:23,454 --> 00:50:25,621
you're gonna have this V
right here like that.

904
00:50:25,623 --> 00:50:28,357
They call that the vicious V.
The broads really love that.

905
00:50:28,359 --> 00:50:29,792
All right? All right.

906
00:50:29,794 --> 00:50:32,728
There you are. It's easy.
You give it a shot.

907
00:50:32,730 --> 00:50:35,064
All right.

908
00:50:46,544 --> 00:50:48,411
Jizz!

909
00:50:48,413 --> 00:50:50,479
Would you relax, man?

910
00:50:50,481 --> 00:50:52,581
Worse than my 80-year-old grand
crack.

911
00:50:52,583 --> 00:50:54,683
You're gonna jinx us all.

912
00:50:54,685 --> 00:50:57,186
Wheeler.

913
00:50:57,188 --> 00:50:59,188
Don't call him Jizz.

914
00:51:03,361 --> 00:51:05,661
I gotta bolt. You guys be cool.

915
00:51:07,598 --> 00:51:09,698
I got you a Christmas present.

916
00:51:14,539 --> 00:51:18,641
Springsteen.<i> Asbury Park.</i>

917
00:51:18,643 --> 00:51:21,377
You know, my friend
saw him live in a bar once.

918
00:51:21,379 --> 00:51:23,312
Really? Mm-hmm.

919
00:51:23,314 --> 00:51:25,748
And this is great.
Thanks a lot.

920
00:51:25,750 --> 00:51:27,149
Sure.

921
00:51:29,587 --> 00:51:31,587
Oh.

922
00:51:35,293 --> 00:51:37,493
Here.

923
00:51:46,604 --> 00:51:49,672
Dunph, it's beautiful.

924
00:51:49,674 --> 00:51:51,340
Double roach clips.

925
00:51:51,342 --> 00:51:52,708
Cool.

926
00:51:52,710 --> 00:51:56,445
Yeah, I got it at the dentist.

927
00:51:59,584 --> 00:52:02,852

00:52:02,854 --> 00:52:05,888

933
00:52:12,763 --> 00:52:15,731

934
00:52:15,733 --> 00:52:17,800

935
00:52:17,802 --> 00:52:21,170

938
00:52:25,443 --> 00:52:27,710
Oh, shit! Whoa!

939
00:52:27,712 --> 00:52:29,645
Aah, Jesus!

940
00:52:31,482 --> 00:52:32,748
Whoa!

941
00:52:37,321 --> 00:52:38,387
You all right, Jack?

942
00:52:38,389 --> 00:52:39,889
Yeah, I'm all right.

943
00:52:39,891 --> 00:52:41,590
Oh, shit.

944
00:52:41,592 --> 00:52:44,627
<i>¶ All right now ¶</i>

945
00:52:44,629 --> 00:52:47,630
<i>¶ Baby, it's all right now ¶</i>

946
00:52:49,800 --> 00:52:51,367
What's up?

947
00:52:51,369 --> 00:52:53,602
Your room got raided.
Fundy got them all.

948
00:52:53,604 --> 00:52:56,172
Wheeler, Irving, Billy Fu,
all of them.

949
00:52:56,174 --> 00:52:58,307
Oh, shit!

950
00:52:58,309 --> 00:53:00,576
Hey, Irv,
Brackett told me what happened.

951
00:53:00,578 --> 00:53:02,878
I can't believe it.
How'd you make out?

952
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,248
Not bad.
Twelve hours plus probation.

953
00:53:06,250 --> 00:53:10,386
My parents are probably getting
a divorce over it.

954
00:53:10,388 --> 00:53:12,321
Could've been worse.

955
00:53:12,323 --> 00:53:14,523
What about the other guys?

956
00:53:14,525 --> 00:53:16,192
Same.

957
00:53:17,461 --> 00:53:20,329
Hey, Dunphy, let's go!

958
00:53:20,331 --> 00:53:22,965
This sucks, Irv. Really sucks.

959
00:53:31,776 --> 00:53:33,642
What are you doing?

960
00:53:33,644 --> 00:53:35,678
Studying.

961
00:53:35,680 --> 00:53:38,681
In case you hadn't noticed,
Funderburk is on the war path.

962
00:53:38,683 --> 00:53:40,516
Besides,
you have a test tomorrow.

963
00:53:40,518 --> 00:53:41,884
So?

964
00:53:41,886 --> 00:53:44,453
So you need to study.
So put that away.

965
00:53:44,455 --> 00:53:46,589
No, this will help us
concentrate.

966
00:53:46,591 --> 00:53:48,958
No, I'm serious.

967
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:53,295
I always do better at the
studying thing when I'm stoned.

968
00:53:53,297 --> 00:53:55,464
It does something
to the brain cells, really.

969
00:53:55,466 --> 00:53:57,766
I'm... I'm not joking around
here. It like, it makes...

970
00:53:57,768 --> 00:54:01,637
Dunph, you haven't had better
than a D since you've been here.

971
00:54:01,639 --> 00:54:03,439
And that's because
there's no good weed around.

972
00:54:03,441 --> 00:54:06,342
It's terrible.

973
00:54:06,344 --> 00:54:07,676
I don't understand you.

974
00:54:07,678 --> 00:54:10,312
You're already
into this Brown University.

975
00:54:10,314 --> 00:54:13,449
Why don't you just try and relax
and enjoy yourself?

976
00:54:13,451 --> 00:54:15,718
Because it's not
about getting in.

977
00:54:15,720 --> 00:54:17,820
It's about doing well.

978
00:54:17,822 --> 00:54:20,289
You know, I busted my butt
for four years

979
00:54:20,291 --> 00:54:21,657
to get into that place.

980
00:54:21,659 --> 00:54:23,926
And it's not just so I could
say, "I go to Brown."

981
00:54:23,928 --> 00:54:25,761
It's because I want to learn.

982
00:54:25,763 --> 00:54:28,464
I want...
I want to challenge myself.

983
00:54:28,466 --> 00:54:30,833
I like that.

984
00:54:33,771 --> 00:54:36,772
All right.

985
00:54:36,774 --> 00:54:39,675
All right, you win, but if we're
gonna do all this studying,

986
00:54:39,677 --> 00:54:42,845
we got to have, like,
one final, like, thing,

987
00:54:42,847 --> 00:54:44,647
like, big blowout.

988
00:54:44,649 --> 00:54:47,283
And it's got to be
in Pawtucket.

989
00:54:49,520 --> 00:54:52,855
<i>¶ I like to dream ¶</i>

990
00:54:52,857 --> 00:54:55,924
<i>¶ Yes, yes, right between</i>
<i>My sound machine ¶</i>

991
00:55:13,444 --> 00:55:15,010
This stuff's kind of harsh,
right?

992
00:55:15,012 --> 00:55:17,346
I'm all right.

993
00:55:17,348 --> 00:55:19,915
Here. Take one of these.

994
00:55:19,917 --> 00:55:21,650
What is it?

995
00:55:21,652 --> 00:55:23,052
Vitamin Q.

996
00:55:23,054 --> 00:55:24,987
Relaxes your throat.

997
00:55:24,989 --> 00:55:26,989
<i>¶ Close your eyes, girl ¶</i>

998
00:55:26,991 --> 00:55:30,059
<i>¶ Look inside, girl ¶</i>

999
00:55:33,898 --> 00:55:36,699
So, how come you never talk
about your mother?

1000
00:55:39,370 --> 00:55:41,770
I don't know.

1001
00:55:41,772 --> 00:55:44,006
I guess 'cause she's dead.

1002
00:55:44,008 --> 00:55:45,841
Oh! Dunph...

1003
00:55:45,843 --> 00:55:48,043
Don't worry about it.

1004
00:55:48,045 --> 00:55:49,912
I was little.

1005
00:55:49,914 --> 00:55:53,082
You know, Jackie doesn't even
remember her.

1006
00:55:53,084 --> 00:55:55,084
But you do?

1007
00:55:55,086 --> 00:55:58,620
Well, you know,
bits and pieces.

1008
00:56:00,758 --> 00:56:02,658
You know,
I remember the day she died,

1009
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:05,861
she cooked this big
turkey dinner,

1010
00:56:05,863 --> 00:56:08,430
you know, with stuffing
and mashed potatoes

1011
00:56:08,432 --> 00:56:10,933
and cranberry sauce.

1012
00:56:13,371 --> 00:56:15,738
You know,
it wasn't even Thanksgiving.

1013
00:56:17,575 --> 00:56:19,441
Was she sick?

1014
00:56:19,443 --> 00:56:21,377
Yeah.

1015
00:56:21,379 --> 00:56:23,946
You know, just sick of...

1016
00:56:23,948 --> 00:56:29,718
of everything.

1017
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:32,788
<i>¶ I miss Alabama once again,</i>
<i>And I think it's a sin, yes ¶</i>

1018
00:56:32,790 --> 00:56:36,125
I don't get it.
It don't make sense.

1019
00:56:36,127 --> 00:56:39,161
See, there's this guy,

1020
00:56:39,163 --> 00:56:41,730
and he's looking back
on his life.

1021
00:56:41,732 --> 00:56:43,882
Right.

1022
00:56:43,883 --> 00:56:46,033
And he sees these two sets
of footprints in the sand.

1023
00:56:46,036 --> 00:56:49,438
Sort of like he had been walking
all along with God.

1024
00:56:49,440 --> 00:56:50,906
But then the guy looks,

1025
00:56:50,908 --> 00:56:54,009
and he notices
that during the tough times,

1026
00:56:54,011 --> 00:56:56,078
there's only one set of prints.

1027
00:56:56,080 --> 00:56:58,046
So, the guy says to God,

1028
00:56:58,048 --> 00:57:01,183
"why did you desert me
when I needed you most?"

1029
00:57:01,185 --> 00:57:03,919
and God says, "no, dummy,

1030
00:57:03,921 --> 00:57:05,954
"when you saw
only one set of prints,

1031
00:57:05,956 --> 00:57:08,690
that was
when I was carrying you."

1032
00:57:10,528 --> 00:57:14,596
Ohh, fucking God, man.

1033
00:57:14,598 --> 00:57:16,598
He's all right, you know?

1034
00:57:27,111 --> 00:57:29,077
Irving, move.

1035
00:57:29,079 --> 00:57:31,680
I got next game.

1036
00:57:31,682 --> 00:57:33,482
Okay, fine, you got next game.

1037
00:57:33,484 --> 00:57:37,186
No, I called next game
the last game.

1038
00:57:37,188 --> 00:57:38,720
It's my turn.

1039
00:57:38,722 --> 00:57:41,924
Kid, just move,
you're shit-faced.

1040
00:57:41,926 --> 00:57:45,928
<i>I'm</i> shit-faced?!

1041
00:57:45,930 --> 00:57:48,897
Hey, pud, you better move
your ass fast

1042
00:57:48,899 --> 00:57:51,166
'cause I'm about to throw
this fuckin' dart.

1043
00:57:51,168 --> 00:57:54,169
Ohh, is that right?

1044
00:57:54,171 --> 00:57:57,706
You're gonna throw
the fuckin' dart!

1045
00:58:01,212 --> 00:58:04,179
Dunph? Dunph, take it out.

1046
00:58:04,181 --> 00:58:06,715
Take it out! Take it out!

1047
00:58:06,717 --> 00:58:08,116
What the hell happened?

1048
00:58:08,118 --> 00:58:09,818
I had next game.

1049
00:58:19,129 --> 00:58:22,064
So you got any girlfriends,
Jackie?

1050
00:58:22,066 --> 00:58:25,200
Oh, yeah. I'm going out with
a couple of Playboy bunnies.

1051
00:58:25,202 --> 00:58:28,170
You're a good-looking guy. Why
couldn't you have a girlfriend?

1052
00:58:28,172 --> 00:58:29,771
I don't know.

1053
00:58:29,773 --> 00:58:31,840
I guess I could.

1054
00:58:31,842 --> 00:58:34,576
But I'm just sort of playing
the field right now.

1055
00:58:36,013 --> 00:58:37,779
Ew.

1056
00:58:37,781 --> 00:58:39,915
Irv, what the fuck?

1057
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,683
Funkadelic.

1058
00:58:42,920 --> 00:58:44,920
You just yorked on me.

1059
00:58:44,922 --> 00:58:48,056
He did?

1060
00:58:48,058 --> 00:58:50,559
Your friends from Pawtucket
seemed really nice.

1061
00:58:50,561 --> 00:58:52,895
Yeah. Yeah, they're good guys.

1062
00:58:52,897 --> 00:58:55,163
Now, remember, Dunph,
we had a deal.

1063
00:58:55,165 --> 00:58:56,999
You have to hold up your end
of the bargain.

1064
00:58:57,001 --> 00:58:58,734
I know. I know.

1065
00:58:58,736 --> 00:59:00,736
<i>¶ Down around the corner ¶</i>

1066
00:59:00,738 --> 00:59:02,771
<i>¶ Half a mile from here ¶</i>

1067
00:59:02,773 --> 00:59:04,840
<i>¶ See them long trains run ¶</i>

1068
00:59:04,842 --> 00:59:06,241
<i>¶ And you watch 'em disappear ¶</i>

1069
00:59:06,243 --> 00:59:08,277
<i>¶ Without love ¶</i>

1070
00:59:09,947 --> 00:59:11,780
<i>¶ Where would you be now? ¶</i>

1071
00:59:15,152 --> 00:59:18,954
<i>¶ Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve? ¶</i>

1072
00:59:22,993 --> 00:59:25,327
<i>¶ You know I saw Miss Lucy ¶</i>

1073
00:59:25,329 --> 00:59:27,563
<i>¶ Down along the tracks ¶</i>

1074
00:59:27,565 --> 00:59:30,566
Yeah, I could hardly believe it
myself, Mr. Dunphy.

1075
00:59:30,568 --> 00:59:34,069
Looks like somebody's gonna have
a good spring break.

1076
00:59:34,071 --> 00:59:37,573
<i>¶ Where would you be</i>
<i>Right now ¶</i>

1077
00:59:39,577 --> 00:59:44,313
¶<i> Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve? ¶</i>

1078
00:59:55,593 --> 00:59:58,827
<i>¶ Without love ¶</i>

1079
00:59:58,829 --> 01:00:01,263
<i>¶ Where would you be now? ¶</i>

1080
01:00:03,801 --> 01:00:08,704
<i>¶ Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve? ¶</i>

1081
01:00:20,217 --> 01:00:24,286
Don't! Dunphy!

1082
01:00:24,288 --> 01:00:26,054
Aah!

1083
01:00:35,966 --> 01:00:38,967
<i>¶ Without lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ve ¶</i>

1084
01:00:41,372 --> 01:00:44,039
<i>After six glorious days</i>
<i>in the sun,</i>

1085
01:00:44,041 --> 01:00:45,907
<i>we ran out of Jane's money.</i>

1086
01:00:45,909 --> 01:00:48,143
<i>So, I dropped her off</i>
<i>in Virginia</i>

1087
01:00:48,145 --> 01:00:50,045
<i>and thumbed it back</i>
<i>to Pawtucket.</i>

1088
01:00:50,047 --> 01:00:51,927
<i>I couldn't wait</i>
<i>to tell the guys.</i>

1089
01:00:55,319 --> 01:00:59,021
Well, if it ain't
beach-blanket bingo.

1090
01:00:59,023 --> 01:01:01,890
What are you doin' here?

1091
01:01:01,892 --> 01:01:04,326
I ran into that knucklehead,
Tommy the Wire.

1092
01:01:04,328 --> 01:01:07,663
He told me you were gonna
be here. You're late.

1093
01:01:07,665 --> 01:01:10,999
Shorty, two more of these.

1094
01:01:27,117 --> 01:01:29,451
So, what's the story?

1095
01:01:29,453 --> 01:01:31,219
I went to Florida.

1096
01:01:31,221 --> 01:01:34,990
I know you went to Florida.
Everyone wants to go to Florida.

1097
01:01:34,992 --> 01:01:36,291
You should've told me.

1098
01:01:36,293 --> 01:01:37,926
I didn't think you'd let me go.

1099
01:01:37,928 --> 01:01:41,797
Fuckin' A right,
I wouldn't have let you go.

1100
01:01:48,138 --> 01:01:49,371
Is this your first martini?

1101
01:01:49,373 --> 01:01:52,174
Yeah... today.

1102
01:01:56,947 --> 01:01:58,780
All right.

1103
01:01:58,782 --> 01:02:03,018
I'm gonna put the cards
on the table.

1104
01:02:03,020 --> 01:02:06,154
You always come first with me.

1105
01:02:06,156 --> 01:02:09,491
Anything I ever done was for you
and your brother.

1106
01:02:09,493 --> 01:02:11,026
You remember that.

1107
01:02:15,833 --> 01:02:18,133
All right.

1108
01:02:18,135 --> 01:02:20,001
We're puttin' our cards
on the table here...

1109
01:02:20,003 --> 01:02:22,370
how come you never told me
about Mom?

1110
01:02:22,372 --> 01:02:24,272
You always think
I'm out to screw you.

1111
01:02:24,274 --> 01:02:25,974
No, Pop.

1112
01:02:25,976 --> 01:02:27,476
I never said that.

1113
01:02:27,478 --> 01:02:29,311
Yeah, but you think it.

1114
01:02:29,313 --> 01:02:31,079
And you think it's my fault

1115
01:02:31,081 --> 01:02:33,148
your blessed mother
shot herself.

1116
01:02:33,150 --> 01:02:36,451
God knows I tried to help her.

1117
01:02:36,453 --> 01:02:39,254
She was a young girl
when we got married,

1118
01:02:39,256 --> 01:02:42,257
not much older
than you are now.

1119
01:02:42,259 --> 01:02:44,092
What are you, 18, 19?

1120
01:02:44,094 --> 01:02:45,894
Seventeen.

1121
01:02:47,131 --> 01:02:49,765
Seventeen.

1122
01:02:49,767 --> 01:02:52,501
That's a great age to be.

1123
01:02:55,038 --> 01:02:56,972
You never seen such a beauty.

1124
01:02:56,974 --> 01:02:58,840
Not like these broads
you guys run with now

1125
01:02:58,842 --> 01:03:01,003
with all the shit
on their face.

1126
01:03:03,046 --> 01:03:04,446
Your mother.

1127
01:03:04,448 --> 01:03:06,248
Oh, boy.

1128
01:03:08,318 --> 01:03:11,186
All the time
she got depressed, though,

1129
01:03:11,188 --> 01:03:13,321
no matter how happy
she really was.

1130
01:03:13,323 --> 01:03:17,225
Then you come along,

1131
01:03:17,227 --> 01:03:19,828
this wriggly, little thing
I couldn't even recognize.

1132
01:03:26,370 --> 01:03:30,105
I bawled my eyes out
the night you were born.

1133
01:03:30,107 --> 01:03:32,474
Thought everything
would be good.

1134
01:03:34,311 --> 01:03:36,278
You want another one?

1135
01:03:36,280 --> 01:03:37,579
I'll have a beer.

1136
01:03:37,581 --> 01:03:41,483
Shorty, one more for me
and a beer for Dildo.

1137
01:03:41,485 --> 01:03:43,285
Do me a favor.

1138
01:03:43,287 --> 01:03:45,420
Don't call me Dildo in public.

1139
01:03:46,523 --> 01:03:49,825
It's a joke.

1140
01:03:49,827 --> 01:03:53,261
What's the matter? You think
I don't love you no more?

1141
01:03:53,263 --> 01:03:54,429
Come over here
and give me a hug.

1142
01:03:54,431 --> 01:03:55,597
Pop...

1143
01:03:58,268 --> 01:03:59,935
What, you're afraid
to hug your old man?

1144
01:03:59,937 --> 01:04:02,137
No, it's bullshit. What?

1145
01:04:02,139 --> 01:04:03,605
I said it's bullshit!

1146
01:04:03,607 --> 01:04:05,407
You watch your fuckin' mouth.

1147
01:04:05,409 --> 01:04:07,209
Then stop lyin' to me.

1148
01:04:07,211 --> 01:04:09,411
I know you were divorcing Mom
when she shot herself.

1149
01:04:09,413 --> 01:04:11,079
You don't know nothin'!

1150
01:04:19,022 --> 01:04:20,355
Hey...

1151
01:04:20,357 --> 01:04:22,591
hey!

1152
01:04:28,232 --> 01:04:29,965
Your mother loved you
and Jackie.

1153
01:04:29,967 --> 01:04:31,433
That's all you got to know.

1154
01:04:34,438 --> 01:04:36,938
Life isn't
a fuckin' fairy tale, buddy,

1155
01:04:36,940 --> 01:04:39,074
I got news for you.

1156
01:04:39,076 --> 01:04:42,944
It isn't easy being Ozzie
when you ain't got a Harriet.

1157
01:04:42,946 --> 01:04:45,313
And I loved your mother.

1158
01:04:45,315 --> 01:04:48,049
But I couldn't live with her
after a while.

1159
01:04:48,051 --> 01:04:50,518
She made me nuts, okay?
Is that what you want to hear?

1160
01:04:53,924 --> 01:04:57,626
It was stupid to get married.
We weren't made for each other.

1161
01:04:57,628 --> 01:05:00,262
But I loved her at first sight.

1162
01:05:00,264 --> 01:05:03,164
And I was an idiot about it.

1163
01:05:03,166 --> 01:05:08,203
I wanted her to be something
that she couldn't be.

1164
01:05:08,205 --> 01:05:09,971
The woman...

1165
01:05:12,242 --> 01:05:14,376
The woman was mentally ill.

1166
01:05:14,378 --> 01:05:17,979
She was afraid of life.

1167
01:05:17,981 --> 01:05:19,614
She wouldn't even
leave the house.

1168
01:05:19,616 --> 01:05:23,251
For God's sake, she never even
learned how to drive a car.

1169
01:05:23,253 --> 01:05:25,420
It made me crazy.

1170
01:05:25,422 --> 01:05:28,490
Almost seven years together,

1171
01:05:28,492 --> 01:05:31,927
you know how many times
we went out?

1172
01:05:31,929 --> 01:05:35,163
Once, one time. That's it.

1173
01:05:43,373 --> 01:05:44,706
And I guess
you'll never forgive me

1174
01:05:44,708 --> 01:05:46,788
till it happens to you, huh?

1175
01:05:50,514 --> 01:05:52,213
Timothy...

1176
01:05:56,086 --> 01:05:58,620
well, I hope
you never forgive me.

1177
01:07:19,736 --> 01:07:23,071
You gonna eat that whole thing?

1178
01:07:23,073 --> 01:07:25,240
I'm just pickin'.

1179
01:07:27,144 --> 01:07:29,411
You know that was full
this morning.

1180
01:07:29,413 --> 01:07:32,247
Good stuff.

1181
01:07:32,249 --> 01:07:35,250
Supposed to have all-natural
preservatives or some shit.

1182
01:07:35,252 --> 01:07:36,618
Hmm?

1183
01:07:36,620 --> 01:07:39,521
You should try
this other kind they got.

1184
01:07:39,523 --> 01:07:41,556
Heavenly Hash. Ho ho,<i> marron.</i>

1185
01:07:41,558 --> 01:07:44,526
You can't even find it.

1186
01:07:44,527 --> 01:07:47,495
I got to bribe the kid down
at Norm's to hide some for me.

1187
01:07:47,497 --> 01:07:49,297
I'm, uh...

1188
01:07:51,168 --> 01:07:54,169
I'm taking off, Pop.

1189
01:07:54,171 --> 01:07:57,539
That little girl
you're running with?

1190
01:07:57,541 --> 01:07:59,541
Yeah, what about her?

1191
01:08:01,278 --> 01:08:02,677
You putting the wood to her?

1192
01:08:02,679 --> 01:08:03,845
What?

1193
01:08:03,847 --> 01:08:06,514
You think
I don't know what goes on?

1194
01:08:06,516 --> 01:08:08,416
Let me tell you something.

1195
01:08:08,418 --> 01:08:10,685
It's just as much
the guy's responsibility

1196
01:08:10,687 --> 01:08:12,420
as it is the girl's.

1197
01:08:12,422 --> 01:08:14,422
Don't go getting your little
friend there in trouble.

1198
01:08:14,424 --> 01:08:17,592
I know.

1199
01:08:17,594 --> 01:08:20,228
One more thing.

1200
01:08:21,698 --> 01:08:25,600
Makin' sex is
like chinese dinner.

1201
01:08:25,602 --> 01:08:29,671
It ain't over until you both
get your cookies, so...

1202
01:08:29,673 --> 01:08:32,273
remember I said that.

1203
01:08:32,275 --> 01:08:34,642
All right.

1204
01:08:37,114 --> 01:08:38,680
How 'bout a ride, huh?

1205
01:08:55,465 --> 01:08:57,499
Take care, Pop.

1206
01:08:59,836 --> 01:09:02,670
Yeah. Be good.

1207
01:09:04,741 --> 01:09:06,141
Bottoms up, Tonto.

1208
01:09:06,143 --> 01:09:07,509
There you go.

1209
01:09:07,511 --> 01:09:09,310
There's the six and the two.

1210
01:09:09,312 --> 01:09:11,279
If they don't land on the same
side of the board,

1211
01:09:11,281 --> 01:09:13,014
you roll again.

1212
01:09:13,015 --> 01:09:14,748
Oh, no. You move six
and then you move two.

1213
01:09:14,751 --> 01:09:16,584
That is the rule.
It's bullshit.

1214
01:09:16,586 --> 01:09:19,287
Shh, Jesus Christ, they're gonna
hear up at the girls' school.

1215
01:09:19,289 --> 01:09:20,722
Jizz, shut up.

1216
01:09:20,724 --> 01:09:22,924
Don't call me that.

1217
01:09:22,926 --> 01:09:24,592
What, Jizz?

1218
01:09:24,594 --> 01:09:28,196
It's your fucking name.

1219
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:30,665
Hey, come on, come on.
Roll again.

1220
01:09:35,372 --> 01:09:36,771
What's my name?

1221
01:09:38,775 --> 01:09:40,708
It's Irving...

1222
01:09:42,345 --> 01:09:44,579
Jizz.

1223
01:09:44,581 --> 01:09:46,247
Are you fucking crazy?

1224
01:09:48,718 --> 01:09:50,351
All right, Irv.

1225
01:09:50,353 --> 01:09:51,920
Fuck you too, Wheeler.

1226
01:09:51,921 --> 01:09:53,488
All right, all right, all right.
All right, fellas.

1227
01:09:53,490 --> 01:09:55,723
I'm gonna make a phone call.

1228
01:09:55,725 --> 01:09:58,259
You want some?

1229
01:09:58,261 --> 01:10:00,862
Come on, you crazy American,
you're making everything wet.

1230
01:10:00,864 --> 01:10:05,633
Dunph! Dunph!

1231
01:10:05,635 --> 01:10:08,570
Hey! There you are!

1232
01:10:08,572 --> 01:10:09,771
Yeah, where have you been?

1233
01:10:09,773 --> 01:10:11,673
I've been at the fort
for over an hour.

1234
01:10:24,955 --> 01:10:26,854
I'm sorry.

1235
01:10:26,856 --> 01:10:29,216
I got caught up
with these guys, you know?

1236
01:10:29,859 --> 01:10:31,926
So, come on. Let's go.

1237
01:10:31,928 --> 01:10:33,861
Why don't you come up here?

1238
01:10:33,863 --> 01:10:36,998
Yeah, right.
Just get your butt down here.

1239
01:10:37,000 --> 01:10:39,234
Come on, Jane Weston.

1240
01:10:39,236 --> 01:10:42,237
We'll just have a drink,
and then get out of here.

1241
01:10:43,607 --> 01:10:46,007
There you go.

1242
01:10:46,009 --> 01:10:48,309
<i>¶ Doo doo doo ¶</i>

1243
01:10:48,311 --> 01:10:50,645
<i>¶ Doo doo doo-doo ¶</i>

1244
01:10:50,647 --> 01:10:55,383
<i>¶ Run, run, run ¶</i>

1245
01:10:55,385 --> 01:10:56,851
<i>¶ Doo doo doo-doo ¶</i>

1246
01:10:56,853 --> 01:10:59,721
<i>¶ Run, run, run ¶</i>

1247
01:10:59,723 --> 01:11:01,956
<i>¶ You better ride on, baby ¶</i>

1248
01:11:01,958 --> 01:11:04,459
<i>¶ You were born outside</i>
<i>Of the... ¶</i>

1249
01:11:06,429 --> 01:11:09,297
I think you're in the wrong
building, young lady.

1250
01:11:09,299 --> 01:11:12,700
Out... now.

1251
01:11:18,875 --> 01:11:21,509
It would appear we have
a major situation,

1252
01:11:21,511 --> 01:11:23,278
wouldn't you say, gentlemen?

1253
01:11:26,483 --> 01:11:28,283
Uh...

1254
01:11:28,285 --> 01:11:32,720
Billy, I was just comin' by to
see if you guys were studying.

1255
01:11:32,722 --> 01:11:34,889
Well, I would advise you
to study somewhere else,

1256
01:11:34,891 --> 01:11:36,691
Mr. Wheeler.

1257
01:11:36,693 --> 01:11:38,926
Yes, sir.

1258
01:11:43,800 --> 01:11:46,601
Well, you've left me no choice.

1259
01:11:46,603 --> 01:11:49,404
If I don't turn you in,
I'd be doing you a disservice.

1260
01:11:49,406 --> 01:11:51,673
At some point later in life,

1261
01:11:51,675 --> 01:11:53,975
you'll be faced
with a similar situation.

1262
01:11:53,977 --> 01:11:57,512
And next time, hopefully,
you'll make the right decision.

1263
01:11:57,514 --> 01:11:59,781
See, there are
no second chances in life.

1264
01:11:59,783 --> 01:12:01,549
That's what you're learning
here today.

1265
01:12:01,551 --> 01:12:04,052
You control your own destiny.

1266
01:12:04,054 --> 01:12:05,653
You're the one
who made the bed.

1267
01:12:05,655 --> 01:12:06,954
You're the one
who's got to sleep in it.

1268
01:12:06,956 --> 01:12:08,756
You're the one
who made the boneheaded...

1269
01:12:08,758 --> 01:12:11,092
Oh, will you shut the fuck up?

1270
01:12:14,431 --> 01:12:16,064
I beg your pardon?

1271
01:12:16,066 --> 01:12:18,800
You heard me.

1272
01:12:18,802 --> 01:12:20,968
Ah, you've done it now, mister.

1273
01:12:20,970 --> 01:12:23,738
Well, you were already gonna
boot us.

1274
01:12:23,740 --> 01:12:25,840
What are you gonna do now?
Eat us?

1275
01:12:25,842 --> 01:12:28,776
Okay, Dunphy, let's go.

1276
01:12:32,115 --> 01:12:34,582
Dunph, cool off, man.

1277
01:12:34,584 --> 01:12:37,485
Dunph... Take it easy, Dunph.

1278
01:12:40,523 --> 01:12:45,059
Who do you think you are,
you insubordinate little twit?

1279
01:12:45,061 --> 01:12:47,862
Listen, Fundy, save the stuff.

1280
01:12:47,864 --> 01:12:49,597
I know you can't boot us.

1281
01:12:49,599 --> 01:12:53,434
Oh? Please. Illuminate me.

1282
01:12:53,436 --> 01:12:54,736
I know about Billy Fu.

1283
01:12:54,738 --> 01:12:56,838
I know that his father
has committed $5 million

1284
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:59,174
to this school,

1285
01:12:59,175 --> 01:13:01,509
all of which will be received
after Billy Fu graduates.

1286
01:13:01,511 --> 01:13:04,879
Now, you probably figure
you'll let him slide

1287
01:13:04,881 --> 01:13:07,115
and rat the rest of us out.

1288
01:13:07,117 --> 01:13:09,817
But if you do that,
I'll rat him out.

1289
01:13:09,819 --> 01:13:12,887
I won't be blackmailed,
Mr. Dunphy.

1290
01:13:12,889 --> 01:13:14,522
Fine.

1291
01:13:14,524 --> 01:13:16,758
Then we'll take a walk
down to Dean Mort's right now.

1292
01:13:16,760 --> 01:13:19,160
You tell your side of the story,
I'll tell mine.

1293
01:13:19,162 --> 01:13:20,561
Fair enough.

1294
01:13:20,563 --> 01:13:23,398
I'll just show him the grass.

1295
01:13:23,400 --> 01:13:26,634
Then he can call the cops.

1296
01:13:26,636 --> 01:13:29,003
It's not like you were
5 miles up in the woods.

1297
01:13:29,005 --> 01:13:31,873
You idiots were doing it
right here under my nose.

1298
01:13:31,875 --> 01:13:34,108
Now...

1299
01:13:34,110 --> 01:13:36,644
somebody's gonna pay the price.

1300
01:13:38,548 --> 01:13:42,417
Okay, fine.

1301
01:13:42,419 --> 01:13:45,720
There's only one person you want
to screw here anyway, right?

1302
01:13:48,558 --> 01:13:51,159
The rest of 'em get hours.

1303
01:13:51,161 --> 01:13:53,795
Thank you.

1304
01:14:03,940 --> 01:14:07,175
Dunph...

1305
01:14:07,177 --> 01:14:10,044
I got nothin'.

1306
01:14:10,046 --> 01:14:12,547
That's... That's what we got.

1307
01:14:12,549 --> 01:14:17,518
I mean, you know,
probation and a bunch of hours.

1308
01:14:17,520 --> 01:14:19,153
Oh, man, we all walk.

1309
01:14:20,557 --> 01:14:22,123
Oh, good Christ.

1310
01:14:26,596 --> 01:14:29,831
Jane, I'm... I'm sorry.

1311
01:14:29,833 --> 01:14:31,532
I'm so sorry.

1312
01:14:31,534 --> 01:14:32,867
I'll go to the D.C.

1313
01:14:32,869 --> 01:14:34,735
I'll tell him the truth,
that you weren't even...

1314
01:14:34,737 --> 01:14:36,938
Dunph, I was caught red-handed

1315
01:14:36,940 --> 01:14:40,074
in the boys' dormitory
with booze and pot.

1316
01:14:40,076 --> 01:14:41,008
It's over.

1317
01:14:42,912 --> 01:14:44,712
I feel so bad, you know.

1318
01:14:44,714 --> 01:14:47,248
They spent so much money,
and now I can't get in anywhere.

1319
01:14:47,250 --> 01:14:49,183
Forget Brown University.

1320
01:14:49,185 --> 01:14:52,086
Of course you will.
You got the grades.

1321
01:14:52,088 --> 01:14:55,656
Even if you got to start
at, like, a junior college.

1322
01:14:55,658 --> 01:14:58,125
You don't get it, Dunph.

1323
01:15:00,630 --> 01:15:02,497
I'm sorry.

1324
01:15:03,566 --> 01:15:05,833
Jane...

1325
01:15:05,835 --> 01:15:07,535
I got to go.

1326
01:15:12,675 --> 01:15:16,744
It's not all your fault.
I didn't have to listen to you.

1327
01:15:16,746 --> 01:15:19,146
Goodbye.

1328
01:15:19,148 --> 01:15:22,083
Janie...

1329
01:15:42,205 --> 01:15:46,541
<i>¶ Ahhhhh ¶</i>

1330
01:15:46,543 --> 01:15:50,144

<i>Girl ¶</i>

1342
01:16:34,991 --> 01:16:37,992
Mr. Dunphy?

1343
01:16:37,994 --> 01:16:39,293
Mr. Dunphy!

1344
01:16:39,295 --> 01:16:41,128
Yeah?

1345
01:16:41,130 --> 01:16:42,830
Hey!

1346
01:16:44,834 --> 01:16:48,769
Last night,
there was a car accident,

1347
01:16:48,771 --> 01:16:53,674
and your... Your friend
Drugs Delaney...

1348
01:16:53,676 --> 01:16:56,310
I'm very sorry.

1349
01:16:59,716 --> 01:17:02,149
Oh, man.

1350
01:17:06,255 --> 01:17:11,692

1351
01:17:14,097 --> 01:17:18,899

1354
01:17:32,982 --> 01:17:36,817
I want to say something
about Drugs.

1355
01:17:37,987 --> 01:17:39,754
Drugs was a good shit.

1356
01:17:41,791 --> 01:17:44,859
Wire, you got anything to say?

1357
01:17:44,861 --> 01:17:49,797
That fucking guy
could party, man.

1358
01:17:49,799 --> 01:17:53,834
When everybody took one,
he took two.

1359
01:17:53,836 --> 01:17:56,356
Nobody could take
that away from him.

1360
01:17:57,373 --> 01:17:58,973
Decenz,
you've got anything to say?

1361
01:17:58,975 --> 01:18:01,342
Nah.

1362
01:18:01,344 --> 01:18:03,110
Tommy said it all.

1363
01:18:03,112 --> 01:18:05,746
What the fuck?

1364
01:18:05,748 --> 01:18:08,849
¶ ...bird you cannot change ¶

1365
01:18:08,851 --> 01:18:12,019
¶ Oh, whoa, oh, whoa, whoa, oh ¶

1366
01:18:12,021 --> 01:18:16,290
¶ And the bird
You cannot change ¶

1367
01:18:16,292 --> 01:18:19,226
<i>I wanted to be alone,</i>

1368
01:18:19,228 --> 01:18:23,130
<i>but being alone made me think</i>
<i>about Drugsie...</i>

1369
01:18:23,132 --> 01:18:25,332
<i>Crazy bastard.</i>

1370
01:18:25,334 --> 01:18:27,234
<i>I wondered, if there was</i>
<i>a heaven and hell,</i>

1371
01:18:27,236 --> 01:18:28,436
<i>which one he'd go to.</i>

1372
01:18:28,438 --> 01:18:30,838
<i>Eh, I hate to even say it,</i>

1373
01:18:30,840 --> 01:18:34,875
<i>but I couldn't see drugs</i>
<i>up there with all those saints.</i>

1374
01:18:37,447 --> 01:18:40,715
<i>Who knows?</i>
<i>Maybe he'll get lucky.</i>

1375
01:18:40,717 --> 01:18:45,052
<i>Maybe after you die,</i>
<i>there's just nothin'.</i>

1376
01:18:45,054 --> 01:18:47,888
Huh.

1377
01:18:47,890 --> 01:18:49,757
Will you throw
your fucking card?

1378
01:18:49,759 --> 01:18:51,025
Oh, it's my turn again?

1379
01:18:51,027 --> 01:18:53,828
Yeah, it's a rotation thing,
Einstein. Come on.

1380
01:18:53,830 --> 01:18:57,331
You're holding trump
again, you cockfucker.

1381
01:18:57,333 --> 01:18:59,734
So now it's my fault?

1382
01:19:15,985 --> 01:19:17,786
<i>Before going back to Cornwall,</i>

1383
01:19:17,787 --> 01:19:20,221
<i>there was something I knew</i>
<i>I had to take care of.</i>

1384
01:19:23,025 --> 01:19:25,426
- Brown University.
- Dean Rogers' office.

1385
01:19:25,428 --> 01:19:28,496
Could I ask you to hold just one
moment, please, sir? Thank you.

1386
01:19:28,498 --> 01:19:30,097
May I help you?

1387
01:19:30,099 --> 01:19:34,034
I need to speak
to Mr. Jonathan S. Rogers Jr.

1388
01:19:34,036 --> 01:19:35,936
Do you have an appointment?

1389
01:19:35,938 --> 01:19:37,338
No, but...

1390
01:19:37,340 --> 01:19:40,007
you don't understand.
I really need to talk to him.

1391
01:19:40,009 --> 01:19:42,343
You really need
to have an appointment.

1392
01:19:42,345 --> 01:19:44,378
But I don't have one.

1393
01:19:44,380 --> 01:19:46,280
Would you like to make one?

1394
01:19:46,282 --> 01:19:49,283
Please? This is very important.

1395
01:19:49,285 --> 01:19:52,086
It could mean the difference
between this girl's whole life.

1396
01:19:52,088 --> 01:19:54,789
Dean Rogers' schedule
is entirely filled today.

1397
01:19:54,791 --> 01:19:56,924
You need an appointment
to see him.

1398
01:19:56,926 --> 01:19:58,859
I'm sorry.

1399
01:19:58,861 --> 01:20:01,328
Thank you for holding, sir.

1400
01:20:01,330 --> 01:20:04,431
What day did you want
to come in?

1401
01:20:04,433 --> 01:20:06,934
The 18th should be fine.

1402
01:20:22,919 --> 01:20:24,285
I know I don't have
an appointment,

1403
01:20:24,287 --> 01:20:25,986
but you have
to give me a chance.

1404
01:20:25,988 --> 01:20:27,555
It's like life or death.
Jane Weston...

1405
01:20:27,557 --> 01:20:29,824
the whole thing,
it wasn't her fault.

1406
01:20:29,826 --> 01:20:32,193
I'm the one.
It's... It's all me.

1407
01:20:32,195 --> 01:20:33,994
It's not fair.
You have to believe me.

1408
01:20:33,996 --> 01:20:36,564
I have absolutely no idea
what you're talking about.

1409
01:20:36,566 --> 01:20:39,500
Cornwall Academy.
Mr. Funderburk.

1410
01:20:39,502 --> 01:20:43,037
Please, sir, just let me in,

1411
01:20:43,039 --> 01:20:44,371
and I'll...
I'll explain everything.

1412
01:20:44,373 --> 01:20:46,240
Please?

1413
01:20:46,242 --> 01:20:48,576
One minute. Come on in.

1414
01:20:51,948 --> 01:20:53,380
It was all just
this big mistake, and...

1415
01:20:53,382 --> 01:20:54,448
Good Lord.

1416
01:20:54,450 --> 01:20:57,051
...and this Jane Weston,

1417
01:20:57,053 --> 01:20:59,086
she's, like, the smartest girl
in the whole school.

1418
01:20:59,088 --> 01:21:00,921
You can't...

1419
01:21:00,923 --> 01:21:02,890
Sir, I know
you're busy and everything

1420
01:21:02,892 --> 01:21:05,159
'cause the lady
out there told me,

1421
01:21:05,161 --> 01:21:06,994
but I really appreciate this.

1422
01:21:06,996 --> 01:21:09,496
Yes, I actually meant come in
through the door.

1423
01:21:11,200 --> 01:21:13,234
You'd better take a seat.

1424
01:21:16,272 --> 01:21:19,473
Yes, Mr. Dunphy,
Jane Weston was accepted,

1425
01:21:19,475 --> 01:21:21,609
but due to the facts
in Mr. Funderburk's letter,

1426
01:21:21,611 --> 01:21:23,911
we reversed our decision.

1427
01:21:23,913 --> 01:21:28,148
Those weren't the facts.

1428
01:21:28,150 --> 01:21:31,085
I know I'm probably not gonna
say this right,

1429
01:21:31,087 --> 01:21:33,988
but the whole college thing,
to me...

1430
01:21:33,990 --> 01:21:37,358
I mean, I'm probably not even
gonna go to college.

1431
01:21:37,360 --> 01:21:40,294
But this girl's whole life
is gonna be ruined.

1432
01:21:40,296 --> 01:21:42,463
Getting into
this Brown University thing,

1433
01:21:42,465 --> 01:21:44,131
it means, like,
everything to her.

1434
01:21:44,133 --> 01:21:47,635
I can see you're concerned about
this young lady's future.

1435
01:21:47,637 --> 01:21:49,503
That's very commendable.

1436
01:21:49,505 --> 01:21:51,639
But don't you think that people
should take responsibility

1437
01:21:51,641 --> 01:21:53,173
for their actions?

1438
01:21:53,175 --> 01:21:55,676
Yes, sir, they should.
And that's why I'm here.

1439
01:21:55,678 --> 01:21:58,379
They were my actions.
It was my fault.

1440
01:21:58,381 --> 01:22:01,282
Someone else is getting blamed
for something I did,

1441
01:22:01,284 --> 01:22:03,250
and it's just not right.

1442
01:22:03,252 --> 01:22:05,019
That's very noble, Mr. Dunphy.

1443
01:22:05,021 --> 01:22:07,621
But chivalry's a tough sell
to the review board.

1444
01:22:10,226 --> 01:22:12,559
Dean Rogers...

1445
01:22:12,561 --> 01:22:15,095
is there one time in your life

1446
01:22:15,097 --> 01:22:18,165
when you made a mistake and you
wish you could take it back,

1447
01:22:18,167 --> 01:22:21,201
'cause if you could,
it would change everything?

1448
01:22:21,203 --> 01:22:24,405
Has that ever happened to you?

1449
01:22:27,109 --> 01:22:28,609
And if it has,

1450
01:22:28,611 --> 01:22:32,613
maybe you could get
the review board to review that.

1451
01:22:43,192 --> 01:22:45,092
This is it, boys.
It's almost over.

1452
01:22:45,094 --> 01:22:46,660
Hey, Irving.

1453
01:22:57,173 --> 01:22:58,672
Mental floss.

1454
01:22:58,674 --> 01:23:00,674
You need help, man.

1455
01:23:03,079 --> 01:23:07,047
So, Fu, you got into Princeton.
What a surprise.

1456
01:23:07,049 --> 01:23:09,083
Crane and Keller
got into Ithaca.

1457
01:23:09,085 --> 01:23:10,217
No way.

1458
01:23:10,219 --> 01:23:12,186
Did you heard about Wheeler?

1459
01:23:12,188 --> 01:23:13,253
He got into Yale.

1460
01:23:13,255 --> 01:23:15,723
Yale?

1461
01:23:15,725 --> 01:23:17,391
How the hell did
he get in there?

1462
01:23:17,393 --> 01:23:18,692
Same way anyone does.

1463
01:23:18,694 --> 01:23:20,995
Get a great recommendation
from Funderburk.

1464
01:23:20,997 --> 01:23:22,162
Fundy's a big Yalie.

1465
01:23:22,164 --> 01:23:24,064
He's got an in
with the admissions board.

1466
01:23:24,066 --> 01:23:26,266
What about Calvert?
Did he get in anywhere?

1467
01:23:26,268 --> 01:23:28,669
Florida. University of Miami.

1468
01:23:28,671 --> 01:23:30,738
Ouch.

1469
01:23:32,241 --> 01:23:34,008
I heard you got into Yale.

1470
01:23:35,745 --> 01:23:37,211
Yeah.

1471
01:23:37,213 --> 01:23:39,313
Yeah, it's pretty unbelievable,
huh?

1472
01:23:39,315 --> 01:23:42,082
Yeah, I guess.

1473
01:23:42,084 --> 01:23:44,251
Yeah.

1474
01:23:44,253 --> 01:23:47,588
Yeah.

1475
01:23:47,590 --> 01:23:50,257
Yeah.

1476
01:23:52,461 --> 01:23:54,661
Hey,
what the fuck are you doing?

1477
01:23:54,663 --> 01:23:57,698
What the fuck is that?

1478
01:23:57,700 --> 01:24:00,134
Lowlife piece of shit.

1479
01:24:00,136 --> 01:24:03,170
Whoa. D-man...

1480
01:24:03,172 --> 01:24:05,272
w-where's this coming from?

1481
01:24:05,274 --> 01:24:07,207
You got Jane booted.

1482
01:24:07,209 --> 01:24:09,376
What are you talking about?

1483
01:24:09,377 --> 01:24:11,544
You ratted us out so Fundy would
give you a recommendation.

1484
01:24:11,547 --> 01:24:14,415
That's bull. He gave a lot
of guys good recommendations.

1485
01:24:14,417 --> 01:24:16,316
He busted you winter term.

1486
01:24:16,318 --> 01:24:19,053
In my room, he busted you.

1487
01:24:19,055 --> 01:24:21,588
Why would he give you
a good one?

1488
01:24:21,590 --> 01:24:23,190
He gave it to me
before he busted me.

1489
01:24:23,192 --> 01:24:24,458
He would have canceled it...

1490
01:24:24,460 --> 01:24:27,561
Called Yale and told them
what a stoner you were.

1491
01:24:29,065 --> 01:24:31,165
Maybe he forgot.

1492
01:24:41,744 --> 01:24:43,277
Don't, Dunph.

1493
01:24:43,279 --> 01:24:45,612
You little punk.
You fucked us all, man.

1494
01:24:45,614 --> 01:24:47,581
Fuck, man,
this is totally uncool.

1495
01:24:47,583 --> 01:24:48,816
You don't have
any fucking proof.

1496
01:24:48,818 --> 01:24:50,584
Oh, proof?

1497
01:24:50,586 --> 01:24:52,486
Proof ain't gonna matter

1498
01:24:52,487 --> 01:24:54,387
when your head's cracked open
on the sidewalk down there.

1499
01:24:54,390 --> 01:24:55,622
Dunphy. Dunphy, take it easy.

1500
01:24:55,624 --> 01:24:59,159
Take it easy, man. Dunph.

1501
01:24:59,161 --> 01:25:01,862
Unh!

1502
01:25:11,740 --> 01:25:15,209
What's the point?

1503
01:25:15,211 --> 01:25:17,744
Your life?

1504
01:25:17,746 --> 01:25:19,880
It's gonna suck anyway.

1505
01:25:30,659 --> 01:25:32,693
Dunph!

1506
01:25:35,631 --> 01:25:37,197
Huh.

1507
01:25:37,199 --> 01:25:40,400
Hey. Hey.

1508
01:25:40,402 --> 01:25:41,668
How'd you get here?

1509
01:25:41,670 --> 01:25:44,271
I took my parents' car.

1510
01:25:44,273 --> 01:25:45,506
They let you?

1511
01:25:45,508 --> 01:25:47,908
Come on down.

1512
01:25:47,910 --> 01:25:50,177
Don't move.

1513
01:26:01,157 --> 01:26:02,723
Hi.

1514
01:26:02,725 --> 01:26:04,791
Hi.

1515
01:26:10,499 --> 01:26:14,201
J-Jane, I...

1516
01:26:14,203 --> 01:26:17,404
I-I'm so sorry
about everything.

1517
01:26:22,444 --> 01:26:24,411
You... You got back in.

1518
01:26:35,457 --> 01:26:36,857
I brought you a present.

1519
01:26:36,859 --> 01:26:38,559
Hm?

1520
01:26:43,966 --> 01:26:45,732
No.

1521
01:26:48,571 --> 01:26:51,738
What? What's the matter?

1522
01:26:51,740 --> 01:26:53,307
Nothing.

1523
01:26:54,476 --> 01:26:56,543
It's just...

1524
01:26:56,545 --> 01:26:59,780
I want to remember this moment.

1525
01:27:01,483 --> 01:27:04,851
I... I don't want it to be hazy
'cause of this.

1526
01:27:07,389 --> 01:27:08,755
I want to savor it.

1527
01:27:08,757 --> 01:27:12,259
You know, let it really sink in.

1528
01:27:12,261 --> 01:27:15,295
So it'll always be there.

1529
01:27:17,433 --> 01:27:18,899
Okay, I got it.

1530
01:27:18,901 --> 01:27:20,701
You can torch it now.

1531
01:27:25,341 --> 01:27:28,976
<i>We stayed there all night</i>
<i>and it was really beautiful.</i>

1532
01:27:28,978 --> 01:27:32,646
<i>We made plans to see each other</i>
<i>over the summer.</i>

1533
01:27:32,648 --> 01:27:36,583
<i>Around dawn Jane nodded off,</i>
<i>but I couldn't sleep.</i>

1534
01:27:36,585 --> 01:27:40,721
<i>I was afraid that if I did,</i>
<i>I'd never feel that good again.</i>

1535
01:27:51,033 --> 01:27:54,268
Paul Patrick Baker.

1536
01:27:56,505 --> 01:27:59,640
Patrick Michael Carey.

1537
01:28:01,710 --> 01:28:05,512
Christian Robert Catt.

1538
01:28:06,882 --> 01:28:11,285
Gavin Patrick Curren.

1539
01:28:11,287 --> 01:28:12,519
Congratulations.

1540
01:28:12,521 --> 01:28:15,622
Steven Edward Delaney.

1541
01:28:15,624 --> 01:28:16,957
Congratulations.

1542
01:28:16,959 --> 01:28:20,494
Timothy Michael Dunphy.

1543
01:28:31,674 --> 01:28:36,343
Rocky Wayne Fuller.

1544
01:28:36,345 --> 01:28:37,511
Jonathan Beecher Glad...

1545
01:28:37,513 --> 01:28:40,747
Hey, can you hand me
my luggage?

1546
01:28:43,319 --> 01:28:46,620
Peter Edward McNaught...

1547
01:28:48,390 --> 01:28:49,656
Bryan Stewart.

1548
01:28:55,564 --> 01:28:56,963
Hey, Dunph.

1549
01:29:01,737 --> 01:29:03,704
Hey.

1550
01:29:03,706 --> 01:29:06,006
What are you guys doing here?

1551
01:29:06,008 --> 01:29:08,041
What the hell you think
we're doing here?

1552
01:29:08,043 --> 01:29:10,577
You're graduating
from high school, ain't ya?

1553
01:29:13,382 --> 01:29:16,383
Well, yeah, yeah, I guess.
I-it's just no big deal.

1554
01:29:16,385 --> 01:29:17,751
What "no big deal"?

1555
01:29:17,753 --> 01:29:18,953
I suppose you're gonna tell me

1556
01:29:18,954 --> 01:29:21,788
that this is
no big deal, too, huh?

1557
01:29:23,092 --> 01:29:24,591
What's this?

1558
01:29:24,593 --> 01:29:26,660
You got in.

1559
01:29:26,662 --> 01:29:29,529
W-what do you mean?

1560
01:29:29,531 --> 01:29:31,932
Don't play dumb with me.

1561
01:29:31,934 --> 01:29:34,868
Rhode Island Junior College.
You got accepted.

1562
01:29:34,870 --> 01:29:38,905
Oh, yeah, uh...

1563
01:29:38,907 --> 01:29:42,642
Well, actually...
there is no "accepted."

1564
01:29:42,644 --> 01:29:44,764
You just have to sign up, Pop.

1565
01:29:47,116 --> 01:29:49,082
Well, you filled out the forms.

1566
01:29:49,084 --> 01:29:51,385
You showed
a little initiation there.

1567
01:29:51,387 --> 01:29:56,523
You're gonna be the first Dunphy
to go to college.

1568
01:29:56,525 --> 01:29:57,758
I'm proud of you.

1569
01:30:00,929 --> 01:30:03,096
Shake my hand like a man there.

1570
01:30:03,098 --> 01:30:05,465
What are you, a fucking
flounder? There you go.

1571
01:30:06,568 --> 01:30:09,569
Y-you know, Pop, maybe...

1572
01:30:09,571 --> 01:30:10,937
if I do real good here,

1573
01:30:10,939 --> 01:30:12,639
I could get into, like,
a senior college.

1574
01:30:12,641 --> 01:30:14,508
What's that?

1575
01:30:14,510 --> 01:30:17,711
Well, you know, like...
Well, like a regular college,

1576
01:30:17,713 --> 01:30:19,579
where people sleep over
and shit.

1577
01:30:19,581 --> 01:30:21,014
Oh.

1578
01:30:21,016 --> 01:30:23,617
Dunph,
if you had done good here,

1579
01:30:23,619 --> 01:30:25,519
you could have gotten
into a regular college.

1580
01:30:25,521 --> 01:30:27,020
Shut up, you little hard-on.

1581
01:30:27,022 --> 01:30:28,989
You're just jealous
because you're not gonna be

1582
01:30:28,991 --> 01:30:30,690
the first Dunphy
to go to college.

1583
01:30:30,692 --> 01:30:33,627
No, but I can still be
the first to graduate.

1584
01:30:35,564 --> 01:30:36,897
You little ball buster.

1585
01:30:38,967 --> 01:30:41,001
All right, you two ass-bags,
let's get the hell out of here.

1586
01:30:41,003 --> 01:30:44,004
Shorty's got a pitcher
of beers waiting for us.

1587
01:30:44,006 --> 01:30:46,873
So, Dildo, what ever happened
to that girlfriend of yours?

1588
01:30:46,875 --> 01:30:48,975
She's going to Brown University
next year.

1589
01:30:48,977 --> 01:30:51,878
Brown? They got one of those
in Providence, you know.

1590
01:30:51,880 --> 01:30:53,713
There's only one, Pop.

1591
01:30:53,715 --> 01:30:55,482
You hot shit.

1592
01:30:55,484 --> 01:30:57,551
How do you think she's gonna
like riding around Providence

1593
01:30:57,553 --> 01:30:58,985
in this shit box?

1594
01:30:58,987 --> 01:31:00,854
She's gonna be Mrs. Dildo.

1595
01:31:00,856 --> 01:31:02,722
Shut up, you little hard-on.

1596
01:31:09,131 --> 01:31:13,767
