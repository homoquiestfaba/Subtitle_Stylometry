2
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:59,600
We have killed,
Babylonians!

3
00:01:03,200 --> 00:01:05,700
We have killed,
Mesopotamians!

4
00:01:07,600 --> 00:01:09,800
We have killed,
Assyrians! 

5
00:01:10,800 --> 00:01:12,000
Mycenaean’s!

6
00:01:12,400 --> 00:01:13,600
Sumerians!

7
00:01:14,400 --> 00:01:15,600
But-

8
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:20,800
we never had the pleasure

9
00:01:21,600 --> 00:01:22,800
of killing-

10
00:01:24,600 --> 00:01:25,800
an Akkadian! 

11
00:01:32,300 --> 00:01:34,400
Which limb do I 
take first?

12
00:01:37,600 --> 00:01:40,100
May the gods have pity on you!?

13
00:01:41,200 --> 00:01:44,800
Because my brother, will not!

14
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:23,000
You missed! 

15
00:03:38,200 --> 00:03:40,400
You're lucky 
we have the same mother!

16
00:03:49,600 --> 00:03:53,600
Before the time of the pyramids 
a fearsome horde came from the east-

17
00:03:54,000 --> 00:03:58,000
and swept across the barren lands 
of the ancient world.

18
00:04:09,200 --> 00:04:14,000
By the law of the horde their greatest warrior 
was proclaimed their king.

19
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:20,800
His name was Memnon.

20
00:04:22,000 --> 00:04:25,200
He was the greatest swordsman 
the world had ever seen.

21
00:04:46,000 --> 00:04:51,600
With the predictions of a sorcerer who 
could foretell the outcome of every battle- 

22
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:55,600
Memnon slaughtered all 
who resisted him-

23
00:04:59,200 --> 00:05:02,800
until only a 
brave few remained.

24
00:05:15,900 --> 00:05:16,900
Silence!

25
00:05:17,200 --> 00:05:19,600
My father has called 
for silence! 

26
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:21,800
Hold your tongues!  

27
00:05:29,200 --> 00:05:34,000
We are gathered in this place 
to put our differences aside.

28
00:05:34,400 --> 00:05:36,000
There is still 
time for us.

29
00:05:37,200 --> 00:05:38,800
The last of 
the free tribes.

30
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:43,000
To stand together 
against this tyrant.

31
00:05:43,400 --> 00:05:45,800
With his sorcerer 
at his side- 

32
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,700
no mortal can 
defeat Memnon.

33
00:05:48,800 --> 00:05:52,100
And if the sorcerer 
were to die?

34
00:05:53,200 --> 00:05:54,000
What then? 

35
00:05:54,400 --> 00:05:56,400
It's too late for 
your schemes, Pheron.

36
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:02,800
I've raided Memnon's caravans,
broken the supply lines to his troops-

37
00:06:03,400 --> 00:06:06,100
but he still swept across 
the land like a plague.

38
00:06:06,500 --> 00:06:10,600
I will not send my people to their deaths 
in a battle that can't be won.

39
00:06:11,000 --> 00:06:14,200
And what people would that be,
Balthazar?

40
00:06:14,900 --> 00:06:16,900
You are the ruler of 
Nothing-

41
00:06:17,200 --> 00:06:19,200
but a pile of rocks-

42
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,300
and sand.

43
00:06:23,000 --> 00:06:25,900
If I'm no king-

44
00:06:26,700 --> 00:06:29,000
why are you on your 
knees before me?!

45
00:06:29,300 --> 00:06:31,200
Balthazar?!

46
00:06:42,900 --> 00:06:46,900
Akkadian's!
I thought they were wiped out long ago!

47
00:06:47,100 --> 00:06:48,700
They are the last 
of their kind.

48
00:06:49,300 --> 00:06:52,500
By their hand, 
the sorcerer will die.

49
00:06:53,500 --> 00:06:57,000
You put your faith in a clan 
of cutthroats who kill for money? 

50
00:06:57,100 --> 00:07:00,300
They are more than that!
They are skilled assassins-

51
00:07:00,500 --> 00:07:03,100
trained for generations 
in the deadly arts.

52
00:07:03,700 --> 00:07:08,100
And what price, do these 
mercenaries ask from us, father!

53
00:07:09,100 --> 00:07:10,300
20 blood-rubies.

54
00:07:11,500 --> 00:07:12,900
But that's the last of 
our treasury.

55
00:07:13,300 --> 00:07:14,100
Be quiet!

56
00:07:17,000 --> 00:07:21,100
If these men kill the sorcerer,
will you fight?

57
00:07:34,700 --> 00:07:35,900
So be it!

58
00:07:38,300 --> 00:07:40,300
As long as one of us still breathes-

59
00:07:42,300 --> 00:07:43,900
the sorcerer will die!

60
00:07:48,900 --> 00:07:49,900
Assassin!

61
00:07:55,300 --> 00:07:56,300
Him-

62
00:07:57,300 --> 00:07:58,700
we kill for free.

63
00:08:05,100 --> 00:08:07,300
We can reach Memnon's encampment
by nightfall.

64
00:08:09,400 --> 00:08:11,500
When are you going to get rid 
of that filthy beast?

65
00:08:12,100 --> 00:08:13,500
He doesn't mean anything
by it.

66
00:08:14,100 --> 00:08:15,300
Horses are faster.

67
00:08:15,900 --> 00:08:17,300
Camels are smarter.

68
00:09:05,500 --> 00:09:06,700
That one is mine.

69
00:09:07,700 --> 00:09:08,900
Live free.

70
00:09:10,900 --> 00:09:11,900
Die well.

71
00:09:15,500 --> 00:09:16,700
Stop!
Listen to me!

72
00:09:16,800 --> 00:09:18,300
I am a high priest of Seth.

73
00:09:18,700 --> 00:09:22,700
Spare me and I shall bless thee
in five different languages.

74
00:09:23,500 --> 00:09:26,300
You're screwed in five 
different languages.

75
00:09:26,900 --> 00:09:27,900
Wait!

76
00:09:51,900 --> 00:09:53,900
Not that heavy.

77
00:10:22,500 --> 00:10:24,900
Look out for the fat one!
He's behind you!

78
00:10:31,900 --> 00:10:32,700
Help me!

79
00:10:33,100 --> 00:10:35,900
Help me! 
Whoever you are!

80
00:10:36,300 --> 00:10:37,700
Thank you, thank you!
Good sir!

81
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:38,700
Quiet!

82
00:10:38,800 --> 00:10:41,500
Surely, you heard of the enormous reward
for my safe return?

83
00:10:59,100 --> 00:11:00,300
The sorcerer’s tent!

84
00:11:12,100 --> 00:11:12,900
Back!

85
00:11:29,300 --> 00:11:30,300
That way!

86
00:11:30,500 --> 00:11:31,500
Find the other one!

87
00:12:21,500 --> 00:12:23,300
You been betrayed, 
Mathayus.

88
00:12:25,100 --> 00:12:26,300
You know my name?

89
00:12:27,400 --> 00:12:28,700
And why you're here.

90
00:12:37,500 --> 00:12:38,700
He's in the tent!

91
00:13:29,100 --> 00:13:30,900
A living, breething
Akkadian!

92
00:13:31,900 --> 00:13:33,500
This is a rare pleasure!

93
00:13:38,300 --> 00:13:40,900
I hear you trained yourself 
to bear great pain!

94
00:13:41,100 --> 00:13:44,300
You must teach me this.
If you live long enough.

95
00:13:56,900 --> 00:14:00,700
Not looking so full of yourself, 
are you now, assassin.

96
00:14:00,900 --> 00:14:01,500
You.

97
00:14:02,700 --> 00:14:03,900
You betrayed your own father.

98
00:14:04,100 --> 00:14:04,700
Yes.

99
00:14:05,700 --> 00:14:07,500
He was very shocked.

100
00:14:07,900 --> 00:14:10,500
You could tell on the look
on his face.

101
00:14:13,100 --> 00:14:14,500
By my fathers head-

102
00:14:16,700 --> 00:14:17,900
I pledge my allegiance.

103
00:14:19,100 --> 00:14:20,900
You've proven your loyalty,
Takmet.

104
00:14:21,000 --> 00:14:22,300
This one still lives.

105
00:14:38,100 --> 00:14:39,100
Beautiful.

106
00:14:42,700 --> 00:14:43,900
Bring him to me.

107
00:14:51,300 --> 00:14:52,500
Mathayus.

108
00:14:55,900 --> 00:14:57,100
Live free!

109
00:15:01,100 --> 00:15:02,900
Die well, my brother.

110
00:15:11,300 --> 00:15:12,500
So.

111
00:15:14,100 --> 00:15:15,300
How shall this one die?

112
00:15:16,100 --> 00:15:17,300
He shall not die tonight.

113
00:15:18,300 --> 00:15:19,100
Really?

114
00:15:20,900 --> 00:15:23,900
- We shall see.
- Nor shall he die by your hand-

115
00:15:24,500 --> 00:15:26,300
or any hand you command.

116
00:15:33,100 --> 00:15:34,500
You have seen this
in a vision?

117
00:15:35,100 --> 00:15:38,300
To ignore this, would bring
great misfortune.

118
00:15:39,300 --> 00:15:41,500
The gods show him favour
this night.

119
00:15:42,100 --> 00:15:43,900
Just the gods?

120
00:15:50,100 --> 00:15:51,300
What a puzzle then !

121
00:15:52,900 --> 00:15:57,500
How to kill you without using my hand 
or any hand I command !

122
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:20,600
Fascinating,  isn't it?

123
00:16:20,900 --> 00:16:25,500
The smoke, it causes the fire ants to
abandon their homes, you see ?

124
00:16:33,300 --> 00:16:36,500
All the sooner to feast on 
our naked heads.

125
00:16:37,100 --> 00:16:41,100
- You think it's funny !?
- A little bit funny, yes, you see-

126
00:16:41,200 --> 00:16:43,500
I am about to escape while you on 
the other hand-

127
00:16:43,500 --> 00:16:46,500
are about to die a horrible death,
for leaving me to die last night !

128
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:48,000
So what are you waiting for ?

129
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:50,200
You see that one over there ?

130
00:16:50,600 --> 00:16:54,400
He's been drinking that jak-piss for about
an hour now....and very soon-

131
00:16:54,600 --> 00:16:57,000
ah, you see !

132
00:17:09,600 --> 00:17:11,400
Hey, where's the horse thief ?

133
00:17:41,000 --> 00:17:43,400
Hark, come on.....get me out of here.

134
00:17:46,200 --> 00:17:47,000
You-

135
00:17:47,600 --> 00:17:49,000
promise not to kill me?

136
00:17:49,800 --> 00:17:51,400
Yes, I promise.

137
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:56,000
Remember, you are an Akkadian, if you make
an oath you always have to keep it, right ?

138
00:17:56,800 --> 00:17:57,800
That's right.

139
00:17:58,400 --> 00:18:01,800
Promise to take me with you and
share in the spoils of you're adventures.

140
00:18:03,800 --> 00:18:04,600
What?

141
00:18:05,000 --> 00:18:07,000
Fine, yes ! 
I promise.

142
00:18:28,200 --> 00:18:29,400
Now hold still.

143
00:18:30,600 --> 00:18:31,800
Here's one.

144
00:18:32,600 --> 00:18:33,800
That's a big one !

145
00:18:34,200 --> 00:18:35,800
And here comes the mother !

146
00:18:37,800 --> 00:18:39,200
So, where are we going ?

147
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:43,000
To Memnon's kingdom
to avenge my brothers death.

148
00:18:47,400 --> 00:18:49,000
Never touch the bow !

149
00:18:49,100 --> 00:18:50,200
No problem.

150
00:18:52,000 --> 00:18:54,200
- Who are you calling ?
- My ride.

151
00:19:01,800 --> 00:19:03,400
It's a nice camel.

152
00:19:06,900 --> 00:19:09,400
Not much room up here.
Scoot up, please ! 

153
00:19:11,400 --> 00:19:13,400
Hey, we had a deal !

154
00:19:13,500 --> 00:19:16,200
Right, 
and I haven't killed you...yet !

155
00:19:25,000 --> 00:19:27,000
What news from
my sorceress today ?

156
00:19:56,200 --> 00:19:57,400
Good news ?

157
00:19:58,400 --> 00:20:00,400
Your armies will conquer 
in the west.

158
00:20:01,600 --> 00:20:04,600
Queen Isis' forces will scatter
to the four winds.

159
00:20:08,600 --> 00:20:12,400
Give the generals the news. Have them 
make their armies ready for the final campaign.

160
00:20:12,600 --> 00:20:13,800
Yes, my lord.

161
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,400
You think I'm cruel, 
don't you ?

162
00:20:30,800 --> 00:20:33,700
Perhaps you forgotten what it's 
like outside these walls !?

163
00:20:34,200 --> 00:20:36,000
Heartless, ignorant-

164
00:20:36,600 --> 00:20:37,800
and savage.

165
00:20:41,000 --> 00:20:42,400
But I can change that.

166
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,800
I will bring order after 
centuries of chaos.

167
00:20:46,800 --> 00:20:49,000
An order which will last for 
a thousand years.

168
00:20:53,400 --> 00:20:55,800
Rivers of blood can never
bring peace.

169
00:20:56,000 --> 00:20:57,600
But they can bring obedience !

170
00:20:58,900 --> 00:21:00,400
That will suffice for now !

171
00:21:03,300 --> 00:21:06,200
And when I become 
the king of legend-

172
00:21:07,600 --> 00:21:12,000
then you should take your place beside me...
...on the throne-

173
00:21:12,800 --> 00:21:14,200
and in my bed.

174
00:21:15,600 --> 00:21:16,800
But my lord-

175
00:21:18,300 --> 00:21:21,800
in your bed, 
I will loose my gift of sight-

176
00:21:23,600 --> 00:21:26,200
and you would loose your
advantage in battle.

177
00:21:27,500 --> 00:21:32,200
The day I speak of...is that when
 I no longer need your visions.

178
00:21:40,200 --> 00:21:41,400
Gomorra.

179
00:21:43,000 --> 00:21:47,800
Let me tell you ! After a hard day of looting and 
pillaging, there's no greater city than Gomorra !

180
00:21:48,300 --> 00:21:49,800
Except,  maybe Sodoma.

181
00:21:53,400 --> 00:21:55,000
I wish I could join you.

182
00:21:55,200 --> 00:21:56,400
You're not going ?

183
00:21:57,600 --> 00:22:02,200
Believe me,  I like to even the score
with a few of those red-guards myself !

184
00:22:03,000 --> 00:22:06,600
But with the price they got on my head,
I'll never make it through those gates.

185
00:22:08,500 --> 00:22:11,800
I have faith in you, my friend.
You'll get us in !

186
00:22:30,600 --> 00:22:34,600
You see!  They got the city sealed up
tighter than a crabs buttocks.

187
00:22:34,900 --> 00:22:39,000
- I wish there was something I could do to help...
- Oh, but there is !

188
00:22:45,800 --> 00:22:52,600
- What business do you have here ?
- I've come to collect a bargain...a horse-thief.

189
00:22:52,800 --> 00:22:56,200
I know this dog !
They behead him for sure this time.

190
00:22:57,000 --> 00:22:58,800
He'll be all the prettier 
without it.

191
00:23:05,600 --> 00:23:08,200
- What happened ?
- You got us in. I knew you could do it.

192
00:23:08,600 --> 00:23:11,400
A jug of your finest wine for my
roadweary friend here.

193
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:19,000
Wait a minute...the last thing that...I remember... 
..was this huge akkadian fist coming...

194
00:23:19,000 --> 00:23:20,200
- Here's your wine, sir.
- ....to my ....

195
00:23:21,300 --> 00:23:28,200
- Let me know if there's anything else you like.
- It's good to be back in the big city !

196
00:23:29,300 --> 00:23:31,800
- Watch my camel for me ?
- Gladly.

197
00:23:32,600 --> 00:23:37,000
Been working here long time ?
How's the kebab ?

198
00:23:48,100 --> 00:23:52,600
"Merchandise of the highest quality ! Virgin-steel forged
by the monks of Pompey."

199
00:23:53,300 --> 00:23:57,800
"Here they are ! The worlds finest swords !
You can't get respect in Gomorra without them."

200
00:23:58,100 --> 00:24:02,200
"Birds of paradise ! Birds of prey !
The most beautiful birds in the world !"

201
00:24:03,100 --> 00:24:06,000
Hey, soldier !
Those big muscles look clamp.

202
00:24:06,400 --> 00:24:10,000
- Perhaps one of us can help you relax.
- Maybe all of us !

203
00:24:38,600 --> 00:24:43,400
Mister, Mister guidance !
You need a guide to find your way.

204
00:24:46,600 --> 00:24:49,400
A good guide might be able to show
me the way into Memnon’s palace.

205
00:24:49,500 --> 00:24:54,400
But a smart guide wouldn't... or he'd
be shown into...Memnon’s dungeons !

206
00:25:09,900 --> 00:25:11,200
I don't have it !

207
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:14,700
Do you want to earn this one ?

208
00:26:27,400 --> 00:26:35,800
Are you ready! I kill half, you kill half !
Alright.....I kill them all !

209
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:38,800
How about we go around them 
and not kill anyone ?!

210
00:26:44,200 --> 00:26:49,000
- Good Lord ! Are you going to kill me ?
- Maybe later.

211
00:26:49,300 --> 00:26:51,800
Memnon is always threatening 
to have my head.

212
00:26:52,200 --> 00:26:54,600
- Don't touch that !
- What is it ?

213
00:26:56,200 --> 00:27:00,300
- It's my special magic powder.
- Magic powder ?!

214
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:05,700
Yes, magic powder. It's a Chinese formula that 
I procured at great expense.

215
00:27:07,100 --> 00:27:13,500
If I get the recipe right it will move mountains
clear roadways at an instant.

216
00:27:13,900 --> 00:27:20,500
Do great things...wonderful things-
or terrible things !

217
00:27:24,800 --> 00:27:27,300
Like all my inventions, Memnon will try
to use it for war.

218
00:27:27,500 --> 00:27:31,300
- Where is Memnon ?
- Why, you mean to kill him ?

219
00:27:34,300 --> 00:27:35,100
Yes.

220
00:27:35,900 --> 00:27:39,300
In that case, 
I'd say he's in the training-courtyard.

221
00:28:53,400 --> 00:28:59,100
No, let me go !
I didn't do anything.

222
00:29:04,100 --> 00:29:06,100
You know the penalty
for thievery.

223
00:29:41,500 --> 00:29:42,700
An intruder !

224
00:30:02,900 --> 00:30:04,300
Follow me !

225
00:30:07,100 --> 00:30:09,500
- You again !
- How do I get out of here ?

226
00:30:11,100 --> 00:30:13,900
- Through that door.
- What's that ?

227
00:30:14,700 --> 00:30:16,300
It's one of my latest inventions.

228
00:30:16,700 --> 00:30:21,100
It was meant to be a quick means of transportation
but there was a little problem with the landings.

229
00:30:22,300 --> 00:30:25,900
Open !
Open !

230
00:30:26,000 --> 00:30:28,700
- Don't touch that you'll set it off.
- Right !

231
00:30:48,200 --> 00:30:49,300
A man !

232
00:30:50,500 --> 00:30:55,500
- What is this place ?
- The Memnon harems. But he visits so rarely.

233
00:30:55,500 --> 00:30:57,300
And it gets so lonely.

234
00:31:01,500 --> 00:31:04,500
- Can't you leave me alone, Thorak ?
- Watch your tongue, Philos.

235
00:31:05,700 --> 00:31:08,300
Careful with those !
They're delicate instruments.

236
00:31:08,700 --> 00:31:12,100
You're lucky that Memnon has
a taste for your science-

237
00:31:12,300 --> 00:31:13,900
old fool !

238
00:31:16,900 --> 00:31:21,900
If I find out that you had anything to do 
with this intruder, I will send the executioner.

239
00:31:24,900 --> 00:31:26,300
We know how to please.

240
00:31:27,200 --> 00:31:29,100
- I'm sure you do, ladies...
- Stay with us !

241
00:31:29,500 --> 00:31:32,600
- Stay with us !
- That's nice but now isn't a good time...

242
00:31:32,600 --> 00:31:35,900
We will make you're every 
fantasy come true.

243
00:32:07,100 --> 00:32:08,300
Kill him !

244
00:32:27,900 --> 00:32:29,100
After him !

245
00:32:45,900 --> 00:32:47,100
Go get him !

246
00:33:18,300 --> 00:33:21,700
Well......are you going to try to kill 
me or just stare at me !?

247
00:33:32,000 --> 00:33:33,300
Take a breath.

248
00:33:58,200 --> 00:33:59,900
Gods be praised !

249
00:34:04,700 --> 00:34:06,700
How dare you touch me !

250
00:34:11,600 --> 00:34:15,000
Sorceress, I'm an Akkadian,
hired to kill you.

251
00:34:15,400 --> 00:34:19,800
I find myself in a position where you're more use
to me alive..don't make me change my mind.

252
00:34:24,400 --> 00:34:29,600
And he said "it's not the size of the
hump, it's the motion of the camel." 

253
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:41,200
Alas, 
I must leave you now.

254
00:34:47,800 --> 00:34:50,400
- There is the traitor !
- Holy Great Covens!

255
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:11,600
He's dead ! Just admit it, you smelly camel.
I'm you're master now, you belong to me !

256
00:35:12,400 --> 00:35:15,400
He's dead...dead !
Dead !

257
00:35:17,800 --> 00:35:21,200
- You are alive ! I knew it !
- Right.

258
00:35:22,900 --> 00:35:24,900
I was just saying to the camel :

259
00:35:25,100 --> 00:35:28,000
Camel, no one could kill our 
good friend, Mathayus !

260
00:35:29,000 --> 00:35:29,800
Get on.

261
00:35:29,900 --> 00:35:33,000
Why should I make it easy for you ?
You're sworn to kill me.

262
00:35:33,400 --> 00:35:38,800
- Others will die first.
- That's comforting.

263
00:35:41,000 --> 00:35:44,000
- So...who is your friend ?
- Memnon’s sorcerer.

264
00:35:45,000 --> 00:35:50,000
Memnon’s sorcerer! Are you insane ?!
She could get us all killed.

265
00:35:50,400 --> 00:35:53,000
Memnon will have to leave the safety of 
his palace to get her ! 

266
00:35:53,500 --> 00:35:57,500
So you're going to use me first
and then kill me. I feel so much better.

267
00:35:58,400 --> 00:36:00,800
I could always do it the other way 
around and kill you first ?!

268
00:36:01,900 --> 00:36:05,500
- So, where are we going ?
- The Valley of the Dead.

269
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,500
The Valley of the Dead ?!

270
00:36:07,800 --> 00:36:12,800
Nobody goes there !
That's why they call it The Valley of the Dead !

271
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:15,200
Wait for me, please !

272
00:36:24,700 --> 00:36:33,000
Take a dozen of your best men, track him down,
kill him....and bring her back to me !

273
00:36:35,000 --> 00:36:38,700
- Send me news when he's dead.
- Yes, my lord.

274
00:36:39,300 --> 00:36:40,200
My lord !

275
00:36:42,000 --> 00:36:44,600
There are rumours spreading to the armies
that she's gone.

276
00:36:47,800 --> 00:36:48,800
Is this true ?

277
00:36:48,800 --> 00:36:51,000
- It is, my lord.
- Then silence them !

278
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:55,200
They must believe she's here
if only for a short time.

279
00:37:02,200 --> 00:37:03,800
And when you find the Akkadian-

280
00:37:12,200 --> 00:37:13,600
give him this from me.

281
00:37:19,400 --> 00:37:27,000
- Are we where I think we are ?
- Yes......home !

282
00:38:10,600 --> 00:38:11,800
Where are you going,
sorceress ?

283
00:38:23,600 --> 00:38:24,800
In a hurry to get back 
to Memnon ?

284
00:38:24,900 --> 00:38:28,200
Nor am I in a hurry to get away from you !
I never go back to Memnon !

285
00:38:28,600 --> 00:38:30,400
He kept me prisoner since 
I was a child.

286
00:38:36,700 --> 00:38:38,500
Why did you help me, 
that night in the tent ?

287
00:38:41,600 --> 00:38:44,400
I knew you were the one man
who could help me escape.

288
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:58,400
Run if you like, but there are 
worse dangers out there, than me ?

289
00:39:18,900 --> 00:39:23,300
What do you mean you can't find it ?
I know it's around here, somewhere.

290
00:39:23,400 --> 00:39:26,900
- What are you looking for ?
- Just a little place to get out of the storm.

291
00:39:28,500 --> 00:39:31,300
- What storm ?
- You'll see.

292
00:39:40,900 --> 00:39:44,500
- Thorak.
- Memnon didn't come, did he ?

293
00:39:45,500 --> 00:39:49,100
- He sent his maggots to do his work.
- He's smarter than you think !

294
00:39:50,500 --> 00:39:51,700
Or more cowardly.

295
00:39:52,900 --> 00:39:54,300
Can I go home now ?

296
00:39:58,700 --> 00:40:03,300
Stay here.
Cover up. It'll be safe.

297
00:40:29,300 --> 00:40:33,300
- He's attacking....alone !
- The sun has fried his brain !

298
00:40:33,900 --> 00:40:36,200
A thousand duranas to the one 
who brings me his head !

299
00:41:22,900 --> 00:41:24,500
Akkadian bastard !

300
00:41:27,300 --> 00:41:28,700
Where is he ?

301
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:42,100
This way !

302
00:41:46,700 --> 00:41:48,100
You two first !

303
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,700
Stay on the stones.

304
00:43:30,000 --> 00:43:31,700
Come with me.

305
00:44:04,600 --> 00:44:05,800
Don't touch that !

306
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,000
Coward !

307
00:44:40,600 --> 00:44:42,100
Show your face !

308
00:45:28,500 --> 00:45:30,200
The Akkadian !

309
00:45:39,900 --> 00:45:41,400
Mathayus!

310
00:46:18,000 --> 00:46:22,200
You're alive ! You swatted them like lice !
You are invincible !

311
00:46:50,200 --> 00:46:52,600
Tell me !
Do you think you can save him ?

312
00:46:54,400 --> 00:46:55,900
His fever is high.

313
00:46:56,600 --> 00:46:59,300
A scorpion bit him.
If he does live-

314
00:47:00,100 --> 00:47:02,700
the blood of the scorpion 
will always flow through his veins.

315
00:47:44,000 --> 00:47:45,000
Sorceress...?!

316
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:59,000
It's a miracle.

317
00:48:00,600 --> 00:48:03,800
She cured you. I knew it.
I felt her magic !

318
00:48:05,400 --> 00:48:08,900
It almost killed her but the gods,
they where on our side.

319
00:48:14,700 --> 00:48:18,700
Why ?
Why would you risk your life to save mine ?

320
00:48:19,900 --> 00:48:22,400
Because I believe you 
can save the people.

321
00:48:22,500 --> 00:48:26,200
The people are not my problem.
Memnon is.

322
00:48:27,400 --> 00:48:29,500
You and the people have 
the same problem.

323
00:48:57,600 --> 00:49:05,600
- Pardon, my lord, a message from Thorak.
- Finally, the Akkadian is dead.

324
00:49:12,900 --> 00:49:17,300
- Is there something wrong, my lord.
- Not at all.

325
00:49:18,900 --> 00:49:20,100
Everything is in order.

326
00:49:21,100 --> 00:49:25,800
In fact things are going so well....
...that I'm moving up our planes.

327
00:49:27,100 --> 00:49:30,200
Tomorrow night we feast to 
celebrate our appending victory.

328
00:49:30,900 --> 00:49:33,900
And then we'll drive the last 
of the rebels into the sea.

329
00:49:34,900 --> 00:49:35,900
Now go.

330
00:49:38,900 --> 00:49:39,700
My lord.

331
00:49:40,900 --> 00:49:43,800
It is customary for the sorceress
to be present at these meetings.

332
00:49:45,200 --> 00:49:48,100
- Why is she not here today ?
- She's indisposed.

333
00:49:48,700 --> 00:49:50,100
It is nothing serious,
I hope ?

334
00:49:51,300 --> 00:49:54,500
If it was serious.....
...then you would know about it !

335
00:49:56,800 --> 00:49:58,300
Now, go !

336
00:50:04,000 --> 00:50:07,800
She's alive.
She's with him and he's coming here.

337
00:50:08,600 --> 00:50:09,400
Get ready !

338
00:50:23,300 --> 00:50:25,300
It works...
...it works !

339
00:50:27,700 --> 00:50:32,000
My lady, how lovely to see you out here
in this desolate place !

340
00:50:32,300 --> 00:50:36,500
Let me show you... it works !
Come...come.

341
00:50:37,600 --> 00:50:39,000
My lady sorceress.

342
00:50:42,600 --> 00:50:45,300
You see !
I worked it out.

343
00:50:46,300 --> 00:50:50,200
My Chinese formula.
My magic powder works.

344
00:50:50,300 --> 00:50:54,300
All I needed was salt, Peter's salt.
It was here all the time.

345
00:50:54,500 --> 00:50:56,500
This place is just full of it.

346
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,900
By the way, do any of you
happen to have any water ?

347
00:51:08,800 --> 00:51:14,700
- What do you think, is it safe to drink ?
- Not anymore.

348
00:51:15,000 --> 00:51:19,800
Delicious, you see the sandstone must act
as a natural filter. - Quiet...!

349
00:51:26,900 --> 00:51:34,100
I'm alive....I'm alive...
...for the moment.

350
00:51:57,900 --> 00:52:01,800
- Mathayus!
- Move !

351
00:52:15,200 --> 00:52:16,400
Assassin !

352
00:52:17,300 --> 00:52:18,800
The Gods are good to me.

353
00:52:19,400 --> 00:52:24,600
When we last met you offered to kill me.
Now I have a chance to return the favour.

354
00:52:24,900 --> 00:52:26,200
You trespass here.

355
00:52:26,600 --> 00:52:30,200
Our survival depends on this 
place being kept a secret.

356
00:52:30,600 --> 00:52:34,100
So we have a problem,
as long as you're alive.

357
00:52:34,300 --> 00:52:36,500
No problem ! I can keep a secret,
like no other...in fact....

358
00:52:36,700 --> 00:52:40,300
I can not remember how we got here...
...we took a left turn....

359
00:52:40,500 --> 00:52:42,300
- It's to late for that.
- Balthazar!

360
00:52:44,500 --> 00:52:47,800
This place is sanctuary for all 
of Memnon’s enemies, you know that !

361
00:52:48,300 --> 00:52:51,300
- This man is dangerous.
- You're judgment is clouded.

362
00:52:51,400 --> 00:52:57,100
My judgement keeps all of you alive !
This man cannot be trusted...and I'll prove it.

363
00:52:57,800 --> 00:52:59,000
Bring the woman to me !

364
00:53:04,000 --> 00:53:06,300
The first man to touch her will have 
to come through me !

365
00:53:14,500 --> 00:53:16,500
I hoped for nothing less !

366
00:54:28,700 --> 00:54:30,100
That's not fair !

367
00:54:57,300 --> 00:54:58,600
No !

368
00:55:15,100 --> 00:55:16,200
Do you yield ?

369
00:55:16,300 --> 00:55:18,500
- Never !
- Then you're a fool.

370
00:55:19,300 --> 00:55:22,100
- We're brothers in the same cause.
- Brothers ?

371
00:55:22,500 --> 00:55:26,300
You brought death to my people.
Memnon will follow you-

372
00:55:27,000 --> 00:55:29,000
he will come for his sorceress.

373
00:55:29,700 --> 00:55:32,500
Yes, I know who she is !

374
00:55:32,800 --> 00:55:35,000
Memnon will stop at nothing
until she's returning.

375
00:55:35,100 --> 00:55:40,100
He'll come swiftering deadlier once he has her.
Memnon will stop at nothing.

376
00:55:40,600 --> 00:55:44,000
Hide here as long as you can, but believe  
me when I say he'll find you.

377
00:55:44,400 --> 00:55:48,800
And if he isn't stopped, he'll sweep across
this land and kill all of you.

378
00:55:51,700 --> 00:55:54,500
And who's going to stop him, Akkadian ?
You ?

379
00:55:55,600 --> 00:55:58,300
Will you stand alone before the fury 
of his armies ?

380
00:56:02,500 --> 00:56:03,300
Yes.

381
00:56:24,500 --> 00:56:28,100
A gentleman always lets the lady win !
That's two out of three ?

382
00:56:30,400 --> 00:56:34,100
- Dates ?
- Oh, thank you !

383
00:57:21,400 --> 00:57:23,700
Cassandra!

384
00:57:57,800 --> 00:57:59,100
I've had a vision.

385
00:58:00,600 --> 00:58:04,900
Memnon will follow me here
and destroy these people.

386
00:58:05,200 --> 00:58:06,500
You know this ?

387
00:58:15,500 --> 00:58:19,800
The things I see are like 
shimmers in a pond.

388
00:58:21,100 --> 00:58:25,000
Some are certain and some
are like shadows.

389
00:58:26,000 --> 00:58:27,300
But I do know this :

390
00:58:28,600 --> 00:58:32,600
Memnon will release his armies 
and ride straight through this place.

391
00:58:32,900 --> 00:58:35,000
Memnon will die by my hand.

392
00:58:42,400 --> 00:58:44,700
It seems the Gods favour me 
tonight, Akkadian !

393
00:59:02,300 --> 00:59:06,500
If you face Memnon...
...you will die !

394
00:59:09,300 --> 00:59:18,100
- That is your destiny.
- I make my own destiny.

395
01:00:09,400 --> 01:00:10,900
I need your help.

396
01:00:53,100 --> 01:00:56,300
- Where do you think you're going with my horse ?
- To Gomorra.

397
01:00:56,500 --> 01:00:58,100
Nothing we can say will
stop him.

398
01:00:59,300 --> 01:01:01,000
Without your sorceress ?

399
01:01:01,000 --> 01:01:05,500
She returned to save the lives of your people.
I won't let her face Memnon’s wrath alone.

400
01:01:06,000 --> 01:01:06,900
Step aside.

401
01:01:07,000 --> 01:01:09,500
Akkadian.
You 're riding to your death !

402
01:01:10,300 --> 01:01:18,800
If I let you ride alone...
...what glory would there be left for me ?

403
01:01:50,300 --> 01:01:51,800
This night we celebrate.

404
01:01:53,300 --> 01:01:57,000
Eat...
...and drink your fill-

405
01:01:57,500 --> 01:01:59,700
for tomorrow, we ride into battle.

406
01:02:05,700 --> 01:02:09,100
I would have captured them myself
but he ran like a coward-

407
01:02:09,500 --> 01:02:11,700
and left this bow behind.

408
01:02:14,900 --> 01:02:19,700
My lord...there is something that 
is troubling our soldiers

409
01:02:21,400 --> 01:02:22,500
How distressing.

410
01:02:23,600 --> 01:02:25,000
Do tell !

411
01:02:26,000 --> 01:02:30,200
It's been said, that the sorceress
is no longer by your side.

412
01:02:32,100 --> 01:02:36,900
Soldiers will fall prey to idle
palace-gossip.

413
01:02:37,700 --> 01:02:40,100
You have my word, 
she's perfectly safe.

414
01:02:40,500 --> 01:02:45,300
If the men are to fight,
to die... they may need more than that.

415
01:02:49,200 --> 01:02:52,100
- You doubt my word ?
- It is not that, sire.

416
01:02:52,600 --> 01:02:55,700
It's just that she's a symbol from 
which the men derive courage.

417
01:02:55,900 --> 01:02:58,400
Symbols are most effective 
when seen !

418
01:02:58,600 --> 01:02:59,700
My lord !

419
01:03:06,900 --> 01:03:11,300
I am here at your request.
Pardon my absence.

420
01:03:12,300 --> 01:03:18,900
I was not well. But our appending
victory has lifted my spirit.

421
01:03:20,600 --> 01:03:27,300
Is this sufficient to placate your men ?
Tell him what you see, sorceress.

422
01:03:33,100 --> 01:03:40,500
I see a great victory.
Your enemies will reveal themselves to you.

423
01:03:49,700 --> 01:03:54,500
Halt !
What is in the cart ?

424
01:03:54,900 --> 01:04:01,200
What is in the cart ?!
Actually...it's a bit of a surprise.

425
01:04:03,000 --> 01:04:07,800
A gift for tonight’s festivities.
Prince Takmets request.

426
01:04:09,300 --> 01:04:10,900
Very nice.

427
01:04:16,400 --> 01:04:17,600
Well now.

428
01:04:18,100 --> 01:04:19,700
Let's see that pretty little face.

429
01:05:10,900 --> 01:05:14,700
Now go to my chambers.
We have things to discuss.

430
01:05:20,500 --> 01:05:22,700
My sincerest apologies,
my lord.

431
01:05:27,300 --> 01:05:28,600
I understand.

432
01:05:31,300 --> 01:05:34,700
You are fearful ....weak !

433
01:05:40,900 --> 01:05:42,600
The feast is over !

434
01:05:43,100 --> 01:05:46,400
To bed men, 
for tomorrow we conquer !

435
01:05:50,900 --> 01:05:52,300
Fortify the palace guard.

436
01:06:09,600 --> 01:06:11,300
Alright.
That was the easy part.

437
01:06:12,000 --> 01:06:14,300
- Everybody know what to do ?
- Cripple the guards.

438
01:06:14,600 --> 01:06:17,800
- Alight the powder.
- And try not to get killed.

439
01:06:19,800 --> 01:06:22,900
- What are you doing here, you could get hurt?
- So could you !

440
01:06:23,200 --> 01:06:24,400
Stay in the wagon.

441
01:06:26,400 --> 01:06:27,900
You watch yourself,
Akkadian !

442
01:06:29,700 --> 01:06:31,700
No need for concern, miss !

443
01:06:31,900 --> 01:06:33,700
Oh...he's going to pay for that !

444
01:06:41,700 --> 01:06:44,500
Seal the gates.
Seal all the gates.

445
01:06:51,200 --> 01:06:53,100
Though I'm relieved to 
see you unharmed-

446
01:06:56,100 --> 01:06:58,500
I am somewhat surprised 
the Akkadian didn't kill you !

447
01:06:58,700 --> 01:07:01,300
He was after you !
I was merely a pawn.

448
01:07:01,500 --> 01:07:04,700
- But you escaped his grasp ?
- I'm not without my wiles.

449
01:07:06,500 --> 01:07:08,100
Yes, I'm well aware of that.

450
01:07:08,800 --> 01:07:10,200
Bring them.

451
01:07:16,500 --> 01:07:18,500
Tomorrow, my victory
is complete.

452
01:07:18,700 --> 01:07:22,200
- That is your vision ?
- As I said, I have seen it.

453
01:07:22,700 --> 01:07:27,800
Have you ?!
I sense a change in you.

454
01:07:28,400 --> 01:07:32,900
You seem somehow...
...diminished.

455
01:07:33,700 --> 01:07:37,300
I assure you,
I am myself.

456
01:07:37,700 --> 01:07:38,900
Good.

457
01:07:39,600 --> 01:07:41,700
A small demonstration shouldn't
trouble you then.

458
01:07:58,200 --> 01:07:59,500
A simple test.

459
01:08:39,100 --> 01:08:42,100
Now, go !
Everyone leave !

460
01:08:56,500 --> 01:08:58,600
- Where am I going ?
- Stop !

461
01:08:59,300 --> 01:09:02,900
It's over there.
It should be just there.

462
01:09:15,100 --> 01:09:16,500
Good man.

463
01:09:50,800 --> 01:09:55,700
Well, well...
...what do we have here ?

464
01:10:07,300 --> 01:10:09,000
One at a time !

465
01:10:21,700 --> 01:10:24,500
Six urns...four cobras...!

466
01:10:24,600 --> 01:10:28,100
Now. 
Let's see what you can see !

467
01:11:02,100 --> 01:11:05,700
Excellent.
One empty pot left, now.

468
01:11:13,600 --> 01:11:15,100
Who dies first ?!

469
01:11:33,400 --> 01:11:34,600
We're almost there !

470
01:11:44,100 --> 01:11:46,800
You know what I see ?
Fear.

471
01:11:48,900 --> 01:11:53,600
You have lost your power.
Thrown it all away.

472
01:12:11,100 --> 01:12:14,000
- What magic is this ?
- Mine.

473
01:12:14,100 --> 01:12:17,100
I see your faith,
hollow king !

474
01:12:18,300 --> 01:12:20,300
And its time has come.

475
01:12:23,800 --> 01:12:26,100
You wish to test magic
against steel ?

476
01:12:39,300 --> 01:12:42,100
I come for the woman...
...and your head !

477
01:12:44,300 --> 01:12:48,700
The Assassin and The Sorceress !
How romantic !

478
01:12:50,300 --> 01:12:52,300
I'll bury you both together !

479
01:13:50,300 --> 01:13:51,500
And here it is.

480
01:13:52,900 --> 01:13:54,500
The foundation-stove !

481
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:23,900
- Hurry, we're running out of time !
- I'm hurrying, I'm hurrying...

482
01:14:57,300 --> 01:15:00,500
Fire in front...
...and palace-guards at your back.

483
01:15:00,700 --> 01:15:03,100
Looks like I'll be keeping my head
after all, Akkadian !

484
01:15:16,600 --> 01:15:18,100
Kill the witch !

485
01:16:15,400 --> 01:16:16,500
Mathayus!

486
01:16:59,700 --> 01:17:01,500
For your father !

487
01:18:01,000 --> 01:18:02,300
Die well, assassin !

488
01:18:36,300 --> 01:18:38,900
It seems the Gods favour me
tonight, Akkadian !

489
01:18:57,100 --> 01:19:01,300
Mathayus....!

490
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,100
- Hurry up and light it.
- You hurry up and light it.This is your invention !

491
01:19:26,100 --> 01:19:27,100
Follow me.

492
01:20:09,800 --> 01:20:12,300
Ready...weapons !

493
01:20:49,800 --> 01:20:51,800
Attack !

494
01:20:58,500 --> 01:21:00,500
So much for not getting
killed !

495
01:21:07,900 --> 01:21:09,300
Catch this !

496
01:22:18,900 --> 01:22:20,600
Hail, to the king !

497
01:22:22,900 --> 01:22:24,900
I knew it from the start.

498
01:22:26,900 --> 01:22:28,100
Mathayus !

499
01:23:01,100 --> 01:23:04,300
Stay here with us, Balthazar.
There's much work to be done.

500
01:23:04,900 --> 01:23:07,100
I have to look after my
own people.

501
01:23:07,400 --> 01:23:11,100
You're a king now, Akkadian,
and a good one, I think.

502
01:23:12,300 --> 01:23:16,100
Don't forget how you got here,
or the people you came from.

503
01:23:16,300 --> 01:23:18,300
My people will live on, 
through me.

504
01:23:19,300 --> 01:23:22,500
Remember, there'll always be 
a place for you here.

505
01:23:23,700 --> 01:23:25,300
Live free !

506
01:23:26,100 --> 01:23:27,700
Rule well !

507
01:23:33,200 --> 01:23:38,100
Remember, Nubian eyes will be 
watching you, Scorpion King !

508
01:23:42,700 --> 01:23:45,900
I see a time of great peace
and prosperity ahead.

509
01:23:47,300 --> 01:23:48,900
How is it you see this ?

510
01:23:49,400 --> 01:23:51,900
Don't the legend say you'll lose
your powers if you...

511
01:23:54,800 --> 01:23:58,300
Can you think of a better way to keep a  
king from taking advantage ?

512
01:23:58,900 --> 01:24:01,300
Well, neither could my
ancestors.

513
01:24:02,700 --> 01:24:04,900
But, how long will this 
time of peace last ?

514
01:24:08,200 --> 01:24:11,000
Nothing lasts forever,
my king.

515
01:24:12,200 --> 01:24:15,300
And that is the destiny
of all kingdoms.

516
01:24:16,000 --> 01:24:19,800
Then we'll make our own
destiny.
