<i>Waking up in the light</i>

00:00:44,191 --> 00:00:46,318
<i>Of a shiny new day</i>

3
00:00:46,393 --> 00:00:48,827
<i>Giving thanks to the moon</i>

4
00:00:48,895 --> 00:00:51,022
<i>For guiding my way</i>

5
00:00:51,098 --> 00:00:54,932
<i>There is no better gift to the soul</i>

6
00:00:55,001 --> 00:00:59,233
<i>Than each breath that my body can hold</i>

7
00:00:59,306 --> 00:01:02,639

<i>Love is no secret</i>

<i>Look all around you</i>

13
00:01:22,529 --> 00:01:25,828
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

14
00:01:31,037 --> 00:01:33,403
- Whoa.
- Look out! She´s after us!

00:01:33,473 --> 00:01:36,067
- You gotta help us!
- You gotta hide us!

16
00:01:36,143 --> 00:01:38,134
Too late. Here she comes!

17
00:01:46,319 --> 00:01:50,221
- l told you that was no moosette!
- She looked like one from behind.

18
00:01:50,290 --> 00:01:54,090
- What´s gotten into you two?
- Well, it´s that time of year.

19
00:01:54,161 --> 00:01:56,493
- Spring fever!
- Spring what?

20
00:01:56,563 --> 00:01:59,157
- You know. The birds...
- Yeah, and the bees.

21
00:01:59,232 --> 00:02:02,861
And the moosettes. lf you know
what we mean by ´´moosettes.´´

22
00:02:02,936 --> 00:02:07,202
Yeah, well, don´t look now
but your girlfriend´s back.

23
00:02:07,274 --> 00:02:08,764
Jeez!

24
00:02:09,576 --> 00:02:12,773

<i>Look all around you</i>

28
00:02:22,022 --> 00:02:26,152
<i>Welcome to this day</i>

29
00:02:27,828 --> 00:02:29,819
Awesome! Let´s do it again!

30
00:02:31,031 --> 00:02:32,362
Hey, Kenai!

31
00:02:32,432 --> 00:02:35,526
- Hiya, Tug!
- Where y´all off to in such a hurry?

32
00:02:35,602 --> 00:02:38,093
- Crowberry Ridge.
- We´re gonna get dibs.

33
00:02:38,171 --> 00:02:40,765
There´s elderberries,
salmonberries, raspberries,

34
00:02:40,841 --> 00:02:43,935
whortleberries, strawberries,
huckleberries, crowberries...

35
00:02:44,010 --> 00:02:46,911
Hey, hey, hey, slow down now.
That´s a lot of berries.

36
00:02:46,980 --> 00:02:49,141
Yeah, there´s plenty!
You wanna come with us?

37
00:02:50,217 --> 00:02:52,117
Tug!

38
00:02:53,153 --> 00:02:57,089
Well, l´d love to, Little Koda,
but can´t keep the girls waiting.

39
00:02:57,157 --> 00:02:58,647
Aw, who needs girls?

40
00:02:58,725 --> 00:03:01,125
We´re two footloose guys out on the tundra.

41
00:03:01,862 --> 00:03:05,195
That´s right. Kenai and Koda.
We don´t need anybody else.

42
00:03:05,265 --> 00:03:09,326
- OK, but you can´t run from love.
- Tug!

43
00:03:09,402 --> 00:03:12,963
lt has a way of tracking you down.

44
00:03:13,039 --> 00:03:16,770
Hi, Hoonah!
You look mighty lovely today.

45
00:03:20,347 --> 00:03:25,614
Did you see the look on Tug´s face?
´´Can´t keep the girls waiting!´´

46
00:03:25,685 --> 00:03:28,381
- All right. How about we get some rest?
- Rest?

47
00:03:28,455 --> 00:03:31,652
We´ve been hibernating
for six months. Who needs rest?

48
00:03:31,725 --> 00:03:36,526
Who needs rest? A couple of bears who´ll
beat the other bears to Crowberry Ridge.

49
00:03:36,596 --> 00:03:38,791
We´ll get first dibs
on the berries, right?

50
00:03:38,865 --> 00:03:43,461
Yeah, you bet.
lf you promise to go to sleep.

51
00:03:43,537 --> 00:03:46,028
OK, OK, OK, OK.

52
00:03:47,274 --> 00:03:51,870
l know all bears like berries,
but l love berries.

53
00:03:51,945 --> 00:03:54,106
Good night, Koda.

54
00:03:55,949 --> 00:04:00,909
- Are you a berry-liker or berry-lover?
- Good night, Koda.

55
00:04:13,033 --> 00:04:15,501
- Nita!
- Kenai!

56
00:04:16,770 --> 00:04:18,294
Yeah!

57
00:04:25,712 --> 00:04:29,239
- Race you to Hokani Falls!
- Wait up!

58
00:04:32,252 --> 00:04:34,277
Here l come!

59
00:04:40,393 --> 00:04:41,587
Nita!

60
00:05:13,560 --> 00:05:15,221
Here.

61
00:05:24,371 --> 00:05:26,669
We´re always gonna be best friends.

62
00:05:55,435 --> 00:05:58,768
Nita! Time to go!

63
00:05:58,838 --> 00:06:00,829
Goodbye, Kenai.

64
00:06:04,344 --> 00:06:06,335
See ya!

65
00:06:10,517 --> 00:06:12,951
Bye, Nita.

66
00:06:16,356 --> 00:06:18,347
Bye, Nita.

67
00:06:19,025 --> 00:06:21,220
Bye, Nita...

68
00:06:25,031 --> 00:06:27,158
So who´s Nita?

69
00:06:27,233 --> 00:06:29,758
- What?
- Did you know you talk in your sleep?

70
00:06:29,836 --> 00:06:33,533
You were going: ´´Nita! Nita!´´

71
00:06:33,606 --> 00:06:39,806
- So who´s Nita?
- She´s a girl l used to know.

72
00:06:39,879 --> 00:06:43,679
- Whatever happened to her?
- l don´t know.

73
00:06:43,750 --> 00:06:46,685
l guess she grew up.

74
00:06:51,291 --> 00:06:52,952
He´s here! He´s here!

75
00:06:53,026 --> 00:06:55,893
- The groom is here!
- Hurry. Let us prepare.

76
00:06:55,962 --> 00:06:58,954
Hurry up! l wanna see him.
l wanna see Atka.

77
00:06:59,032 --> 00:07:01,296
Nita, he´s here!

78
00:07:01,367 --> 00:07:03,358
They´re here!
Prepare for the ceremony.

79
00:07:03,436 --> 00:07:06,337
He must have brought
his entire village with him.

80
00:07:06,406 --> 00:07:09,569
Well, my sweet, this marriage
is extremely important.

81
00:07:09,642 --> 00:07:11,769
That´s why we came
to help you get ready.

82
00:07:11,845 --> 00:07:15,406
No, no. That´s OK.
l can get myself ready.

83
00:07:15,482 --> 00:07:17,473
Go ahead.
Use all the water.

84
00:07:17,550 --> 00:07:20,644
- Then we´ll just air-dry your hair.
- Air-dry? Certainly not.

85
00:07:20,720 --> 00:07:23,382
- Towel-dry is shinier.
- You know...

86
00:07:23,456 --> 00:07:26,584
We´ll put your hair up
to show off your beautiful eyes.

87
00:07:26,659 --> 00:07:30,755
Up? No, down, of course,
to frame that beautiful face.

88
00:07:30,830 --> 00:07:32,821
No. We´ll put it up
to show it off better.

89
00:07:32,899 --> 00:07:34,298
- Down.
- Up.

90
00:07:34,367 --> 00:07:36,096
l am going to say ´´down.´´

91
00:07:37,003 --> 00:07:40,404
She´s nervous. She needs to eat.
l´ll get some smoked salmon.

92
00:07:40,473 --> 00:07:42,168
Salmon? On a nervous stomach?

93
00:07:42,242 --> 00:07:44,574
She needs hackberry root
steeped in rainwater.

94
00:07:44,644 --> 00:07:47,704
- ln the morning? No.
- No, no, l´m fine.

95
00:07:47,781 --> 00:07:50,011
l think l´ll feel better when l´m dressed.

96
00:07:50,083 --> 00:07:52,677
- Dressed?
- l have just the outfit for you.

97
00:07:52,752 --> 00:07:56,051
But you don´t understand.
l already have one picked out.

98
00:07:56,122 --> 00:07:58,352
Simple reindeer hide -
slimming, yet elegant.

99
00:07:58,424 --> 00:08:00,221
No, caribou.
Feathers. Lots of beads.

100
00:08:00,293 --> 00:08:03,023
- Beads? Are you nuts?
- Reindeer for a wedding?

101
00:08:03,096 --> 00:08:04,256
- No beads.
- Seashells!

102
00:08:04,330 --> 00:08:07,458
- What is it with you and your seashells?
- l love seashells.

103
00:08:07,534 --> 00:08:08,558
Hey!

104
00:08:10,103 --> 00:08:13,664
- l do believe l am feeling a bit hungry.
- l´ll get the salmon.

105
00:08:13,740 --> 00:08:16,504
- l´ll get the tea!
- OK! Get plenty of both.

106
00:08:36,095 --> 00:08:41,397
You look as beautiful in that dress
as your mother did on our wedding day.

107
00:08:41,467 --> 00:08:46,734
Thanks, Daddy.
l wanted to wear something of hers today.

108
00:08:46,806 --> 00:08:52,267
That means so much to me.
Your mother would be so proud.

109
00:08:54,414 --> 00:08:59,283
- l wish she was here.
- She is.

110
00:08:59,352 --> 00:09:01,752
ln here.

111
00:09:01,821 --> 00:09:03,982
Once you love someone,

112
00:09:04,057 --> 00:09:07,652
they stay in your heart forever.

113
00:09:12,599 --> 00:09:16,000
Are you ready to meet Atka?

114
00:09:44,097 --> 00:09:51,799
Great spirits, we come before you today
to bond this man and this woman as one.

115
00:09:52,338 --> 00:09:55,102
We pray this pleases you.

116
00:10:20,333 --> 00:10:21,561
Nita!

117
00:10:34,047 --> 00:10:38,245
- The spirits are trying to tell us something.
- lt must be a sign.

118
00:10:50,496 --> 00:10:53,158
l don´t understand!
How could this happen?

119
00:10:53,232 --> 00:10:55,223
The villagers say it´s a sign.

120
00:10:55,301 --> 00:10:57,792
The villagers?
What the heck do they know?

121
00:10:57,870 --> 00:11:00,600
Do you want the advice of the villagers
or a professional?

122
00:11:00,673 --> 00:11:02,573
No, definitely a professional.

123
00:11:02,642 --> 00:11:07,341
They say that in all the tribes,
you are the wisest shaman.

124
00:11:07,413 --> 00:11:10,075
Sha-woman! OK?

125
00:11:10,149 --> 00:11:12,982
´´Wise´´ and ´´man´´ don´t even belong
in the same sentence.

126
00:11:13,052 --> 00:11:16,715
Let´s get down to business. So the ice
cracked right out from under you.

127
00:11:16,789 --> 00:11:20,190
Sure you haven´t put on a few pounds?
Come on, girl to girl.

128
00:11:20,259 --> 00:11:25,424
- No. My weight´s been constant.
- Well, lucky you, Miss Constant Weight.

129
00:11:25,498 --> 00:11:29,093
Tell you what. Why don´t we
just ask the spirits, OK?

130
00:11:34,707 --> 00:11:36,971
- Yeah?
- What are they saying?

131
00:11:37,043 --> 00:11:40,570
Don´t interrupt!
lt ain´t all about you.

132
00:11:40,646 --> 00:11:42,876
They say...

133
00:11:42,949 --> 00:11:44,644
You can´t marry Ka-ka!

134
00:11:44,717 --> 00:11:47,049
- Atka.
- Whatever! The point is...

135
00:11:47,120 --> 00:11:49,611
you´re already matched up,
Miss Two-Timer.

136
00:11:49,689 --> 00:11:54,353
- Already matched up? To whom?
- To the one who gave you this.

137
00:11:55,561 --> 00:11:58,689
Look at that picture.
That thing is crystal-clear.

138
00:12:00,066 --> 00:12:02,500
- Kenai?
- The bear boy?

139
00:12:02,568 --> 00:12:07,631
- No, no, no. We were just kids.
- l´ve heard that one before.

140
00:12:07,707 --> 00:12:10,471
There has to be a way to undo this.

141
00:12:10,543 --> 00:12:14,138
Undo it?
You can´t undo what´s been done.

142
00:12:14,213 --> 00:12:17,842
lt´s done. Case closed.
No more conversation.

143
00:12:18,818 --> 00:12:21,309
There is one way.

144
00:12:21,387 --> 00:12:26,324
You must go and eat an ox.

145
00:12:26,392 --> 00:12:29,589
- What?
- Wait. l´m sorry.

146
00:12:29,662 --> 00:12:31,493
lt´s the equinox.

147
00:12:32,298 --> 00:12:36,826
- Does this place mean anything to you?
- Hokani Falls?

148
00:12:38,404 --> 00:12:40,895
That´s where Kenai
gave me the amulet.

149
00:12:41,841 --> 00:12:44,309
You gotta go to Hokani Falls.

150
00:12:44,377 --> 00:12:49,576
And on the eve of the equinox,
when the spirits change winter into spring,

151
00:12:49,649 --> 00:12:56,521
you must burn the amulet and
send the bond back up to the ancestors.

152
00:12:57,323 --> 00:13:00,121
You know, you might wanna
write some of this down.

153
00:13:00,193 --> 00:13:03,856
The equinox is only three days away!
l have to get going.

154
00:13:03,930 --> 00:13:07,889
With the person who gave you
the amulet.

155
00:13:07,967 --> 00:13:10,868
Kenai? But he´s a bear.

156
00:13:11,704 --> 00:13:15,697
- Yeah?
- You know. A bear?

157
00:13:16,776 --> 00:13:21,213
l know what a bear is,
and l suggest you go look in the woods.

158
00:13:22,548 --> 00:13:25,540
Well, even if l find him,
how will l talk to him?

159
00:13:26,519 --> 00:13:28,487
How will you talk to him?

160
00:13:38,331 --> 00:13:40,322
Don´t be afraid.
lt´s in there.

161
00:13:42,301 --> 00:13:44,895
That ain´t it.
Come on, try it again.

162
00:13:45,705 --> 00:13:48,265
l don´t know what that was.
One more time.

163
00:13:55,148 --> 00:13:59,448
And that mammoth stood there watching
the whole thing. So, l told Bucky,

164
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:03,512
´´The next time you have to sneeze, please
take the walnuts out of your mouth first.´´

165
00:14:03,589 --> 00:14:07,685
Then l started laughing so hard,
guess what came out of my nose.

166
00:14:07,760 --> 00:14:11,127
- Koda, speaking of food...
- l know what you mean.

167
00:14:11,197 --> 00:14:14,030
All this walking
has made me crazy hungry.

168
00:14:17,270 --> 00:14:19,795
Hey, watch it!

169
00:14:22,041 --> 00:14:25,841
All right, step aside, kid. Let a real bear
show you how the digging´s done.

170
00:14:26,379 --> 00:14:29,974
Sure it´s easy now!
l gave you a head start.

171
00:14:30,049 --> 00:14:33,541
Jackpot!
All the roots you can eat, buddy.

172
00:14:33,619 --> 00:14:36,645
- l knew l was onto something.
- Yeah, you did?

173
00:14:36,722 --> 00:14:40,055
What can l say?
l´ve got killer instincts.

174
00:14:40,126 --> 00:14:42,117
Yeah, right.

175
00:14:43,763 --> 00:14:46,596
- Hey, look. ls this a tuber?
- Get down!

176
00:14:46,666 --> 00:14:48,657
What is it?

177
00:15:04,517 --> 00:15:06,542
Quick! Hide in here.

178
00:15:52,698 --> 00:15:54,188
Nita?

179
00:15:55,968 --> 00:16:00,405
Watch it! No, Nita!
lt´s me - Kenai.

180
00:16:01,574 --> 00:16:02,768
Kenai?

181
00:16:05,077 --> 00:16:09,173
- ls it really you?
- Yeah, it´s really me.

182
00:16:09,248 --> 00:16:12,342
Wow!
l´d heard you were a bear,

183
00:16:12,418 --> 00:16:16,377
l just didn´t realize
you´d look so much like a bear.

184
00:16:16,455 --> 00:16:20,448
Yeah, well, look at you.
You really changed.

185
00:16:20,526 --> 00:16:24,292
Wait a minute. You can talk.
l mean, you can understand me?

186
00:16:24,363 --> 00:16:28,766
Yeah. The spirits did it,
so when l found you, l could talk to you.

187
00:16:28,834 --> 00:16:32,895
Whoa. Wait a minute.
You´ve been looking for me? Why?

188
00:16:32,972 --> 00:16:35,634
Well, this is why.

189
00:16:37,043 --> 00:16:40,376
You´ve kept this?
After all these years.

190
00:16:40,446 --> 00:16:44,815
The great spirits told our shaman
that this amulet bonds us as one.

191
00:16:44,884 --> 00:16:45,646
Really?

192
00:16:45,718 --> 00:16:47,948
So now you and l
have to go to Hokani Falls...

193
00:16:48,020 --> 00:16:50,147
- Like when we were kids?
- ...and burn it.

194
00:16:50,222 --> 00:16:52,452
And burn it!
Burn it? What?

195
00:16:52,525 --> 00:16:55,289
lt´s no big deal.
lt´s only a little trinket.

196
00:16:55,361 --> 00:16:58,057
- Little trinket?
- Well, what l mean is,

197
00:16:58,130 --> 00:17:00,598
we were just silly kids.

198
00:17:00,666 --> 00:17:03,999
They won´t let me get married
until it´s destroyed.

199
00:17:04,070 --> 00:17:06,971
Let me think about this.

200
00:17:07,039 --> 00:17:08,666
- Sorry, can´t help you.
- What?

201
00:17:08,741 --> 00:17:12,302
So, have fun burning
the ´´silly little trinket´´ on your own.

202
00:17:12,378 --> 00:17:15,870
You don´t understand.
We have to burn it together.

203
00:17:15,948 --> 00:17:19,850
- Otherwise, it won´t work.
- What won´t work?

204
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:23,116
Nita, this is my brother, Koda.
Koda, Nita. Nita, Koda.

205
00:17:23,189 --> 00:17:26,522
So you´re Nita!
Kenai was just dreaming about you.

206
00:17:28,761 --> 00:17:31,093
- l was not.
- Was too.

207
00:17:31,163 --> 00:17:33,859
You should hear him. ´´Nita! Nita!´´

208
00:17:33,933 --> 00:17:35,992
Well, it´s been nice talking to you,

209
00:17:36,068 --> 00:17:39,469
but Koda and l have big plans
to go to Crowberry Ridge.

210
00:17:39,538 --> 00:17:43,269
Wait! You´re just gonna walk away?
You´re not gonna help me take care of this?

211
00:17:43,342 --> 00:17:44,331
Nope.

212
00:17:44,410 --> 00:17:48,039
You know, neither of us can get on
with our lives until we burn this amulet.

213
00:17:48,114 --> 00:17:49,775
l´ll take my chances.

214
00:17:51,484 --> 00:17:54,180
OK. Fine. Fine.

215
00:17:54,253 --> 00:18:00,158
l´ll just wait for them to turn you back
into a human and send you to find me.

216
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:05,193
- Would they do that?
- No, no, buddy, of course not.

217
00:18:05,264 --> 00:18:07,630
Well, how do you know?

218
00:18:08,801 --> 00:18:11,395
What if they did
turn you back into a man?

219
00:18:12,405 --> 00:18:14,737
Then we wouldn´t be brothers anymore.

220
00:18:14,807 --> 00:18:17,571
No, Koda, it´s...
That´s not...

221
00:18:22,014 --> 00:18:26,348
Fine. OK. We´ll go to Hokani Falls.

222
00:18:26,419 --> 00:18:31,015
But right after that, buddy, just the two
of us, we´ll race down to Crowberry Ridge.

223
00:18:31,090 --> 00:18:34,526
- Pinky swear?
- Pinky swear.

224
00:18:34,593 --> 00:18:37,721
Then it´s settled. Ready?

225
00:18:37,797 --> 00:18:39,924
As l´ll ever be.

226
00:18:41,100 --> 00:18:43,364
Hokani Falls is this way.

227
00:18:43,436 --> 00:18:45,461
l knew that. l knew that.

228
00:18:45,538 --> 00:18:48,405
No, he didn´t.
Kenai has a lousy sense of direction.

229
00:18:48,474 --> 00:18:50,874
- That is not true.
- Once, in the middle of the night,

230
00:18:50,943 --> 00:18:53,741
he was trying to find our cave in the dark...

231
00:18:55,915 --> 00:18:59,976
Course, when we met, he didn´t know
the first thing about being a bear.

232
00:19:00,052 --> 00:19:02,350
Like this one time,
we were hunting for pine nuts

233
00:19:02,421 --> 00:19:05,413
and he stuck his big head
inside a hollow tree.

234
00:19:05,491 --> 00:19:09,621
And l said, ´´You better not do that,
´cause you don´t know who lives there.´´

235
00:19:09,695 --> 00:19:12,596
But he did,
´cause you can´t tell Kenai nothing.

236
00:19:12,665 --> 00:19:13,723
All right, Koda.

237
00:19:13,799 --> 00:19:18,133
Next thing you know, he spent
a whole week smelling like a stinky skunk.

238
00:19:19,071 --> 00:19:21,562
Something tells me
stinky skunk was an improvement.

239
00:19:21,640 --> 00:19:25,076
l got a lot more stinky Kenai stories
if you wanna hear ´em.

240
00:19:25,144 --> 00:19:27,374
- OK, so, like, we gotta go.
- We´ll see ya around.

241
00:19:27,446 --> 00:19:30,540
- So, we´ll give you a call.
- Yeah, we´ll catch you later.

242
00:19:30,616 --> 00:19:32,584
Yeah, we gotta go work out.

243
00:19:32,651 --> 00:19:35,245
Yeah. Gotta keep these muscles
real buff.

244
00:19:35,321 --> 00:19:38,188
- So long. Hey, look, it´s big bear.
- Beauty.

245
00:19:38,257 --> 00:19:40,623
- Hey, guys.
- Boy, are we glad to see you.

246
00:19:40,693 --> 00:19:43,856
Yeah, yeah, ´cause we finally found
a couple of real moosettes.

247
00:19:43,929 --> 00:19:46,591
- Right down there by the stream.
- Bye!

248
00:19:46,665 --> 00:19:48,895
- Toodle-oo!
- So long!

249
00:19:48,968 --> 00:19:50,367
Those guys are weird.

250
00:19:50,436 --> 00:19:53,735
Don´t look.
You´ll only encourage them.

251
00:19:56,041 --> 00:19:57,804
But they won´t give us the time of day.

252
00:19:57,877 --> 00:20:02,211
So, what we was thinking is you could help
us with, you know, an opening line, like:

253
00:20:02,281 --> 00:20:04,272
´´Hey, l see you like to eat twigs.´´

254
00:20:04,350 --> 00:20:09,117
Or how about a sonnet? Like:
´´Shall l compare thee to a summer´s dew?´´

255
00:20:09,188 --> 00:20:12,385
Gee. Forget that brainy stuff.
They´re not owls.

256
00:20:12,458 --> 00:20:15,655
l like, ´´Hey, ladies. Nice dewlaps.
Are those things rea...?´´

257
00:20:15,728 --> 00:20:17,719
Excuse me.

258
00:20:18,531 --> 00:20:20,021
- Gee. Hunter.
- Hunter!

259
00:20:20,099 --> 00:20:23,068
- Run!
- Bye! Every moose for himself.

260
00:20:24,303 --> 00:20:25,668
Act like we´re not here.

261
00:20:25,738 --> 00:20:28,730
lt´s OK. This is Nita.
She´s with me and Kenai.

262
00:20:28,807 --> 00:20:31,071
- She is?
- Well, pleased to meet ya.

263
00:20:31,143 --> 00:20:33,134
- How´s it goin´?
- l´m Rutt, this is my bro...

264
00:20:33,212 --> 00:20:37,876
Kenai, what´s the holdup? We have to set
up camp on that far peak before sundown.

265
00:20:37,950 --> 00:20:39,110
Nice to meet you.

266
00:20:39,184 --> 00:20:43,177
- Scary, isn´t she?
- Let´s go. We´re running out of daylight.

267
00:20:43,255 --> 00:20:46,122
Nita, calm down.
We got plenty of time.

268
00:20:46,191 --> 00:20:49,388
A smart traveler
always allows for unexpected delays.

269
00:20:49,461 --> 00:20:52,362
Well, this won´t be a delay
if you let me have a minute

270
00:20:52,431 --> 00:20:55,889
to give these guys a little
romantic advice.

271
00:20:59,071 --> 00:21:01,699
Romantic advice? From you?

272
00:21:01,774 --> 00:21:04,038
Stop kidding. Let´s go!

273
00:21:07,813 --> 00:21:12,580
You know, boys, l think this calls for
more than just a good opening line.

274
00:21:13,285 --> 00:21:15,617
lt does?
Yeah, yeah, of course.

275
00:21:15,688 --> 00:21:20,887
Acts of bravery -
that´s what really impresses the ladies.

276
00:21:20,960 --> 00:21:23,360
Gee, bravery sounds scary.

277
00:21:23,429 --> 00:21:25,556
No, no, you just have to
pretend to be brave.

278
00:21:25,631 --> 00:21:29,123
- Yeah?
- l´ll go out there, l´ll act all ferocious,

279
00:21:29,201 --> 00:21:32,762
and then you guys come over
the beaver dam and rescue them.

280
00:21:32,838 --> 00:21:34,305
OK. Yeah, yeah.

281
00:21:34,373 --> 00:21:36,841
- That´s a beauty plan.
- He´s smart. Not like you.

282
00:21:36,909 --> 00:21:40,470
- Get out.
- Kenai! We don´t have time for this!

283
00:21:40,546 --> 00:21:42,912
- Kenai!
- lt´s no use.

284
00:21:42,982 --> 00:21:46,281
This falls under
´´You can´t tell Kenai nothing.´´

285
00:21:53,125 --> 00:21:56,891
- What´s wrong with him?
- Maybe he got ahold of some bad salmon.

286
00:21:57,830 --> 00:21:59,422
This is stupid.

287
00:22:01,200 --> 00:22:04,294
- This oughta impress the ladies for sure.
- Yeah.

288
00:22:04,370 --> 00:22:06,702
l´m a big hungry bear,

289
00:22:06,772 --> 00:22:10,606
and l´m gonna rip you to shreds! Roar!

290
00:22:12,211 --> 00:22:15,305
l said l´m gonna rip you to shreds!

291
00:22:15,948 --> 00:22:18,382
- l think that´s our cue.
- Yeah. Beauty.

292
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:20,577
Let´s go.
Fear not, Moosettes!

293
00:22:20,653 --> 00:22:23,178
l, Tuke, and my brother, Rutt,
will save you.

294
00:22:23,255 --> 00:22:25,382
- Yeah.
- What ho, largish bear.

295
00:22:25,457 --> 00:22:27,948
Touch not those fair moosette ladies.

296
00:22:28,027 --> 00:22:30,052
You´ll have to go through us
if you want them.

297
00:22:30,129 --> 00:22:33,155
- Yeah! You´ll have to kill us.
- What?

298
00:22:33,232 --> 00:22:35,666
- No, no, not kill us.
- Sorry.

299
00:22:35,734 --> 00:22:40,103
Maybe not kill us, but just, you know,
push us down or something.

300
00:22:50,749 --> 00:22:54,014
Jeez, that was scary.
l thought l was gonna wet my hooves.

301
00:22:54,086 --> 00:22:56,577
You can go back to grazing.
Nothing to see here.

302
00:22:56,655 --> 00:22:59,556
- Toodle-oo!
- Hey, wait! Guys, where are you going?

303
00:22:59,625 --> 00:23:01,354
Don´t leave!

304
00:23:12,738 --> 00:23:17,675
- This used to be such a quiet river.
- Yes. Let´s get outta here.

305
00:23:17,743 --> 00:23:22,305
- Nice rack on that little one, though.
- Are you kidding? All antler and no brain.

306
00:23:23,148 --> 00:23:25,309
That went well.

307
00:23:28,887 --> 00:23:32,823
Hey, Kenai! l thought you were supposed
to be scaring moose.

308
00:23:32,891 --> 00:23:34,552
Do you think you can help me out here?

309
00:23:34,626 --> 00:23:37,652
Do all his plans end
with his head stuck in something?

310
00:23:37,730 --> 00:23:38,719
Most of them.

311
00:23:38,797 --> 00:23:40,697
- Koda!
- Well, they do!

312
00:23:40,766 --> 00:23:45,328
Calm down, Kenai.
We´ll try to get you outta here.

313
00:23:52,611 --> 00:23:55,375
OK, let´s see here.

314
00:23:56,915 --> 00:24:00,248
lt sure would be easier
if he didn´t have such a fat head.

315
00:24:04,490 --> 00:24:06,014
- Hi, Kenai.
- Hi, Koda.

316
00:24:06,091 --> 00:24:09,185
Oh, no! My bag!
My bag! The amulet´s in my bag.

317
00:24:09,261 --> 00:24:13,027
lt´s floating right in front of you.
Just grab it.

318
00:24:13,766 --> 00:24:15,927
Nita!

319
00:24:17,536 --> 00:24:22,439
You get it. l can´t, l can´t.
lt´s right there! Kenai, get it.

320
00:24:22,508 --> 00:24:26,740
- l´m a little busy here.
- lt´s getting away! Help! Get it!

321
00:24:26,812 --> 00:24:28,575
Stop...

322
00:24:29,448 --> 00:24:31,541
Oh, no!

323
00:24:31,617 --> 00:24:33,346
The amulet!

324
00:24:33,418 --> 00:24:34,976
There it is!

325
00:24:42,694 --> 00:24:46,528
l guess this would qualify
as one of those unexpected delays.

326
00:24:46,598 --> 00:24:49,192
There it is.

327
00:24:49,268 --> 00:24:50,963
Thank goodness.

328
00:24:54,306 --> 00:24:56,365
Let´s see what we got here.
We got...

329
00:24:56,441 --> 00:24:58,409
Hey! Wait! That´s my stuff.

330
00:25:01,613 --> 00:25:04,480
You leave that alone.
lt´s mine!

331
00:25:07,553 --> 00:25:09,384
Come on!

332
00:25:17,763 --> 00:25:22,097
lt´s gone. The amulet is gone!

333
00:25:22,167 --> 00:25:25,603
That´s because there ain´t a better thief
than the masked bandit.

334
00:25:25,671 --> 00:25:29,505
Once they get something in their clutches,
you might as well give up all hope.

335
00:25:29,575 --> 00:25:34,239
Nope, that amulet´s as good as gone.
The ice age will end before you get it back.

336
00:25:34,847 --> 00:25:36,712
- Thanks a lot, Kenai.
- What did l do?

337
00:25:36,782 --> 00:25:38,647
- This is all your fault!
- My fault?

338
00:25:38,717 --> 00:25:41,151
- lf you hadn´t helped those moose...
- Whoa!

339
00:25:41,220 --> 00:25:43,450
You´re the one
who destroyed a beaver dam.

340
00:25:43,522 --> 00:25:46,753
Well, l wouldn´t have
if you hadn´t gotten your head stuck in it.

341
00:25:46,825 --> 00:25:49,988
And l´m not the one who had
the bag in reach and then let it float away.

342
00:25:50,062 --> 00:25:53,623
My head was stuck.
What´s your excuse?

343
00:26:00,639 --> 00:26:02,630
What am l gonna do now?

344
00:26:02,708 --> 00:26:07,839
lf l can´t burn the amulet,
l´ll never be able to marry Atka.

345
00:27:11,743 --> 00:27:13,176
Kenai?

346
00:27:13,245 --> 00:27:16,476
Nita! Nita! You gotta come quick!
You´re not gonna believe it!

347
00:27:16,548 --> 00:27:19,244
Kenai spent the whole night
untangling those tracks.

348
00:27:19,318 --> 00:27:22,185
And l didn´t think anybody could,
´cause they were all forks,

349
00:27:22,254 --> 00:27:24,381
double-backs, crisscrosses, dead ends...

350
00:27:24,456 --> 00:27:26,447
Koda! Where is Kenai?

351
00:27:26,525 --> 00:27:31,053
That´s what l´m trying to tell you.
He found the river bandit´s hideout.

352
00:27:31,129 --> 00:27:32,221
Show me!

353
00:27:39,638 --> 00:27:43,904
- Nita! Nita! Over here!
- Well, where is it? Did you get it?

354
00:27:43,976 --> 00:27:46,308
l don´t have it yet.
lt´s up in the tree.

355
00:27:46,378 --> 00:27:49,609
l´m waiting for them to...
fall asleep.

356
00:27:51,183 --> 00:27:54,050
- Nita, wait!
- Hey!

357
00:27:54,119 --> 00:27:58,419
- Nita, what are you doing?
- l´m getting my amulet back.

358
00:27:58,490 --> 00:28:01,926
- Let me handle this.
- l´m fine. l´ve got it covered.

359
00:28:01,994 --> 00:28:04,656
No, seriously, you could fall.

360
00:28:04,730 --> 00:28:07,392
l´m trying to concentrate.

361
00:28:14,072 --> 00:28:19,601
Can´t any of you morons
define the term ´´nocturnal´´? Anyone?

362
00:28:19,678 --> 00:28:21,669
Sorry. Sorry.

363
00:28:21,747 --> 00:28:25,649
lt´s completely my fault.
Just me.

364
00:28:25,717 --> 00:28:28,515
Listen, you´ve got something of ours.

365
00:28:30,422 --> 00:28:34,449
Yeah. lt´s round, about so big.

366
00:28:35,360 --> 00:28:38,693
Maybe l do, maybe l don´t. That´s
for me to know and for you to find out.

367
00:28:38,764 --> 00:28:42,530
lt´s a moot point. Finders keepers,
losers weepers. lt´s the way of the woods.

368
00:28:42,601 --> 00:28:45,502
Hey, you didn´t find it, you stole it, thief.

369
00:28:45,570 --> 00:28:48,095
All right. You got me.
That´s what we do.

370
00:28:48,173 --> 00:28:51,108
We rob from the rich
and give to the less fortunate.

371
00:28:51,176 --> 00:28:53,701
You know, like... us!

372
00:28:58,884 --> 00:29:01,318
l don´t think
you wanna mess with Kenai.

373
00:29:01,386 --> 00:29:04,651
He´s a lean, mean,
raccoon butt-kicking machine.

374
00:29:10,762 --> 00:29:13,754
Go ahead, hit him with all you got.
He can take it.

375
00:29:13,832 --> 00:29:15,629
Koda, what are you doing?

376
00:29:15,700 --> 00:29:18,362
l´m tricking them into using
all their pine cones.

377
00:29:18,437 --> 00:29:21,736
lt´s a pine - ow! - forest.

378
00:29:21,807 --> 00:29:22,796
Right.

379
00:29:22,874 --> 00:29:24,705
- This could take a while.
- You think?

380
00:29:24,776 --> 00:29:27,301
Whoa, whoa! Hey, hey!
What about a trade?

381
00:29:27,379 --> 00:29:29,904
Whoa, whoa!
Hold your fire! Hold, hold, hold.

382
00:29:29,981 --> 00:29:31,846
He wants to trade.

383
00:29:32,951 --> 00:29:34,441
A trade.

384
00:29:34,519 --> 00:29:38,148
- What ya got?
- What do l got? l got lots of things.

385
00:29:38,223 --> 00:29:40,384
l got...

386
00:29:40,459 --> 00:29:43,053
- Pine cone?
- No.

387
00:29:44,563 --> 00:29:46,190
How about a stick?

388
00:29:46,264 --> 00:29:48,391
- A rock?
- You are insulting me.

389
00:29:49,234 --> 00:29:53,330
- l can´t believe...
- Shoo! Shoo! Come on.

390
00:29:53,405 --> 00:29:55,737
Come on, let go.

391
00:30:02,581 --> 00:30:04,173
Mama!

392
00:30:07,252 --> 00:30:08,241
Hi.

393
00:30:08,320 --> 00:30:11,255
Nita, l think it´s time to go.

394
00:30:31,977 --> 00:30:34,070
Nita, behind you!

395
00:30:39,818 --> 00:30:42,082
She´s not bad.

396
00:30:46,358 --> 00:30:48,155
l got an idea. Come on.

397
00:30:49,461 --> 00:30:53,625
- Nita, go to the top.
- What? l´m trying to get down.

398
00:30:53,698 --> 00:30:55,893
Just listen to me.
l know what l´m doing.

399
00:30:56,268 --> 00:31:00,261
Hello! l want what you took from me.

400
00:31:02,741 --> 00:31:04,800
Yeah, that´s it. Keep going!

401
00:31:07,512 --> 00:31:10,072
Let´s get her!

402
00:31:12,350 --> 00:31:14,113
Kenai!

403
00:31:14,186 --> 00:31:18,452
Well, well, well.
Nowhere to run to, baby, nowhere to hide.

404
00:31:19,691 --> 00:31:23,252
- Nita, let go!
- What? This is your plan?

405
00:31:23,328 --> 00:31:25,626
- Just trust me.
- Don´t listen to him.

406
00:31:25,697 --> 00:31:28,757
Come on, come on.
Be a smart little hunter girl.

407
00:31:28,833 --> 00:31:31,233
Hand over the trinket.

408
00:31:33,438 --> 00:31:36,430
Kenai, this better work!

409
00:31:37,576 --> 00:31:39,510
Catch me!

410
00:31:58,163 --> 00:32:01,462
- That was a lot of raccoons.
- l can´t believe l outran all of them.

411
00:32:01,533 --> 00:32:04,263
- When you jumped outta that tree!
- And when you caught me!

412
00:32:04,336 --> 00:32:07,635
- And when we fell...
- You were amazing!

413
00:32:10,375 --> 00:32:13,640
l´m just glad we finally
got the old Nita back.

414
00:32:13,712 --> 00:32:17,079
- What do you mean, ´´the old Nita´´?
- The fun Nita.

415
00:32:17,148 --> 00:32:20,481
Come on. You know you´ve been
kind of a stick-in-the-mud this entire trip.

416
00:32:22,254 --> 00:32:25,280
OK, maybe you don´t know.

417
00:32:25,357 --> 00:32:27,825
lt´s just good to see you
loosen up a bit, you know?

418
00:32:27,892 --> 00:32:30,019
Now, hold on.

419
00:32:30,428 --> 00:32:32,692
What stinks?

420
00:32:32,764 --> 00:32:34,925
lt´s not me, Koda.

421
00:32:35,000 --> 00:32:38,436
That´s the most disgusting thing
l´ve ever smelled.

422
00:32:38,503 --> 00:32:41,495
- Let´s go check it out.
- Hey. Hey!

423
00:32:41,573 --> 00:32:45,339
Wait a minute. l´m l´m not finished.

424
00:32:46,411 --> 00:32:49,403
Oh, brother. l have never known
a moose to take this long.

425
00:32:49,481 --> 00:32:51,949
Don´t rush me.
l can´t do it while you´re watching.

426
00:32:52,017 --> 00:32:54,679
- Jeez! You´re getting it on my leg.
- Sorry.

427
00:32:54,753 --> 00:32:56,584
- Hey, largish bear.
- How´s it goin´?

428
00:32:56,655 --> 00:32:58,782
- Are we glad to see you.
- Yeah. Beauty.

429
00:32:58,857 --> 00:33:00,984
We´re gettin´ the brush-off
from the moosettes.

430
00:33:01,059 --> 00:33:03,960
Yeah, they seem immune
to our rugged good looks.

431
00:33:04,029 --> 00:33:08,125
So we thought
we´d appeal to their olfactory senses.

432
00:33:08,199 --> 00:33:11,930
Yes. For example, l´m wearing
essence of wet-leaf compost

433
00:33:12,003 --> 00:33:14,597
with just a hint of sandalwood.

434
00:33:14,673 --> 00:33:19,701
And l´m augmenting my natural moosely
musk with pine needles and river mud.

435
00:33:19,778 --> 00:33:23,908
l got news for you, little brother -
that wasn´t mud.

436
00:33:23,982 --> 00:33:28,749
- Kind of overpowering?
- Guys, don´t sweat it. l got another plan.

437
00:33:28,820 --> 00:33:33,086
Yeah. l think we´ve all seen
your expertise on romance.

438
00:33:33,925 --> 00:33:36,758
Yeah, very funny.
Don´t we have an amulet to burn?

439
00:33:36,828 --> 00:33:38,989
We can spare a moment.

440
00:33:39,064 --> 00:33:41,726
- Beauty.
- What you need here...

441
00:33:41,800 --> 00:33:43,131
Excuse me.

442
00:33:43,201 --> 00:33:45,533
...is a woman´s point of view.

443
00:33:45,603 --> 00:33:48,629
- Yeah?
- And a plan that actually works.

444
00:33:49,074 --> 00:33:51,565
That´s beauty.

445
00:33:53,144 --> 00:33:57,911
Hi. l´m playing with my two best friends
and l need a place to hide.

446
00:33:57,982 --> 00:34:01,611
- Look at the sweet little thing.
- Jeez, l could just eat him up.

447
00:34:01,686 --> 00:34:03,415
Hello!

448
00:34:03,488 --> 00:34:05,718
Go, go. Get moving.

449
00:34:05,790 --> 00:34:07,849
- Beauty.
- Good luck.

450
00:34:07,926 --> 00:34:10,588
- Rutt, would you get going?
- OK.

451
00:34:11,429 --> 00:34:13,158
Excuse us, ladies.

452
00:34:14,632 --> 00:34:16,759
We´re looking for our pal.

453
00:34:16,835 --> 00:34:18,928
- Brownish?
- Why, yes.

454
00:34:19,003 --> 00:34:20,527
- Furry?
- Yes again.

455
00:34:20,605 --> 00:34:22,368
- About yea big?
- That´s him.

456
00:34:22,440 --> 00:34:24,499
Haven´t seen him.

457
00:34:25,210 --> 00:34:29,874
- Here l am. Fooled you. l win.
- There´s no beating you, little buddy.

458
00:34:29,948 --> 00:34:32,439
Look at that.
You´re so good with him.

459
00:34:32,517 --> 00:34:35,111
Yeah. We have lots
of little kid animal friends.

460
00:34:35,186 --> 00:34:37,950
We know a little weasel
and a little badger.

461
00:34:38,022 --> 00:34:41,321
And we´ve even got
some little baby bunny friends.

462
00:34:42,761 --> 00:34:46,424
A smallish bear
is like a babe magnet.

463
00:34:46,498 --> 00:34:47,829
Socialize.

464
00:34:47,899 --> 00:34:51,665
So, would you ladies
be interested in grazing on some twigs?

465
00:34:51,736 --> 00:34:54,227
No thanks. We just ate.

466
00:34:54,305 --> 00:34:58,571
- We love twigs.
- Really? So do we. Right, little brother?

467
00:34:58,643 --> 00:35:01,578
- Shall l compare thee to a summer´s dew?
- Jeez.

468
00:35:01,646 --> 00:35:05,639
Though it aren´t more lovely
and more dewy than you.

469
00:35:05,717 --> 00:35:07,912
- Nice move.
- What´s wrong with him?

470
00:35:07,986 --> 00:35:11,478
Don´t mind my little brother.
He was trampled by an elk herd as a calf.

471
00:35:11,556 --> 00:35:15,322
- Jeez, that´s awful.
- That´s not true. lt was only half a herd.

472
00:35:15,393 --> 00:35:18,385
- You´re serious, right?
- Smooth!

473
00:35:19,230 --> 00:35:22,222
Remind me again,
who´s the better moose matchmaker?

474
00:35:22,300 --> 00:35:24,530
- Beginner´s luck.
- Jealous?

475
00:35:24,602 --> 00:35:29,198
- All right. That was really nice.
- Guys, l did good. Did ya see me? l did it.

476
00:35:29,274 --> 00:35:33,233
You do pretty amazing things with moose.
That´s great. Wonderful.

477
00:35:33,311 --> 00:35:35,871
Hey! Wait for me.

478
00:35:38,716 --> 00:35:41,116
- Koda, be careful.
- Relax. He´s fine.

479
00:35:41,186 --> 00:35:45,054
- He´s just looking for lunch.
- Yeah. Besides, l´m always careful.

480
00:35:46,357 --> 00:35:48,188
Hey, we´re making great time.

481
00:35:48,259 --> 00:35:51,660
Look, see? We just go down this trail
until we hit the river.

482
00:35:51,729 --> 00:35:53,560
- River?
- Yeah. Then we swim across.

483
00:35:53,631 --> 00:35:57,067
- Swim?
- Then it´s just a little ways to Hokani Falls.

484
00:35:57,135 --> 00:36:00,366
We´ll be there by lunchtime tomorrow.

485
00:36:00,438 --> 00:36:04,738
Well, that´s a a good plan.
But what about this?

486
00:36:04,809 --> 00:36:07,243
Up this ridge to that mountain,
climb those cliffs,

487
00:36:07,312 --> 00:36:11,146
then we walk across that snow bridge
and avoid the river altogether.

488
00:36:13,218 --> 00:36:16,415
- That makes more sense to me.
- That doesn´t make any sense.

489
00:36:16,488 --> 00:36:20,424
That´s way out of the way, and
there´s too much up and not enough down.

490
00:36:20,492 --> 00:36:24,485
- l vote for the river.
- Me too. Two to one. We win. Let´s eat.

491
00:36:24,562 --> 00:36:27,827
- Well, it´s my amulet.
- So?

492
00:36:27,899 --> 00:36:32,097
- And my wedding.
- Then have your honeymoon up there.

493
00:36:32,170 --> 00:36:35,662
lf we go that way now, we´ll have to
walk all night to make it to the falls.

494
00:36:35,740 --> 00:36:38,937
- Fine. Then l´ll meet you there.
- Nita, what´s wrong with you?

495
00:36:39,010 --> 00:36:42,104
Trust me, my way
will get us there before...

496
00:36:49,654 --> 00:36:53,181
What´s the matter with you?
You act like you´re afraid of fish.

497
00:36:55,627 --> 00:36:58,187
Oh, my gosh, Kenai!
l can´t believe it.

498
00:36:58,263 --> 00:36:59,924
Hey, Kenai, watch this.

499
00:36:59,998 --> 00:37:04,458
Where´s the girl who´s afraid of fish?
Hi. My name is Nita and l´m afraid of fish.

500
00:37:04,536 --> 00:37:07,994
The fish! The fish!
He´s so scary!

501
00:37:08,072 --> 00:37:11,530
- Oh, no, he´s gonna eat me!
- Koda, come on. Koda, stop.

502
00:37:11,609 --> 00:37:15,272
- He´s almost got me.
- Koda, stop!

503
00:37:22,020 --> 00:37:24,853
We were just kidding around
about the fish.

504
00:37:24,923 --> 00:37:27,517
No, it´s not the fish.

505
00:37:29,327 --> 00:37:31,420
lt´s the water.

506
00:37:32,997 --> 00:37:37,730
Ever since that day
l fell through the ice when we were kids.

507
00:37:39,737 --> 00:37:41,227
l didn´t realize.

508
00:37:41,306 --> 00:37:45,743
That´s why l didn´t grab the bag in the river.

509
00:37:45,810 --> 00:37:50,474
lt wasn´t your fault we lost the amulet.

510
00:37:50,548 --> 00:37:52,743
lt was mine.

511
00:37:52,817 --> 00:37:56,753
Hey, we got it back together.
That´s all that matters, right?

512
00:38:01,559 --> 00:38:03,550
What are you looking at?

513
00:38:05,396 --> 00:38:10,766
- Are you ready to keep going?
- But l´ll never be able to cross that river.

514
00:38:10,835 --> 00:38:14,396
We can do that together, too.

515
00:38:17,342 --> 00:38:21,938
<i>Funny how it turns out</i>
<i>that everything can change</i>

516
00:38:22,013 --> 00:38:26,541
<i>What I feel right now</i>
<i>is not the same as yesterday</i>

517
00:38:26,618 --> 00:38:31,385
<i>There´s more than I imagined</i>
<i>deep inside my heart</i>

518
00:38:31,456 --> 00:38:35,620
<i>Emotions that I never knew</i>.
<i>and this is just the start</i>

519
00:38:36,394 --> 00:38:40,125
<i>So many things I´ve been missing</i>.
<i>not watching</i>

520
00:38:40,198 --> 00:38:43,861
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

521
00:38:43,935 --> 00:38:48,531
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to learn</i>

522
00:38:48,606 --> 00:38:53,441
<i>I´m ready for the world</i>.
<i>not scared of letting go</i>

523
00:38:53,511 --> 00:38:58,141
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to feel</i>

524
00:38:58,216 --> 00:39:00,309
<i>And my heart knows it´s real</i>

525
00:39:00,385 --> 00:39:05,118
<i>The part of me so long forgotten</i>
<i>is calling</i>

526
00:39:05,189 --> 00:39:07,817
<i>And this feels like home</i>

527
00:39:07,892 --> 00:39:09,883
<i>Home. home</i>

528
00:39:09,961 --> 00:39:14,398
<i>- It feels just like home</i>
<i>- It feels just like home</i>

530
00:39:19,203 --> 00:39:23,833
<i>Somehow we´re meant to be together</i>

531
00:39:23,908 --> 00:39:29,141
<i>I feel like you´ve shown me</i>
<i>how to find my way home</i>

532
00:39:29,213 --> 00:39:31,078
<i>Find my way home</i>

533
00:39:31,149 --> 00:39:35,415
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to learn</i>

534
00:39:35,486 --> 00:39:40,253

<i>It feels just like home</i>

541
00:40:10,588 --> 00:40:12,647
lt´s the only way.

542
00:40:16,227 --> 00:40:19,196
Let me help you.

543
00:40:22,667 --> 00:40:25,966
- l changed my mind.
- Nope, it´s too late for that.

544
00:40:26,037 --> 00:40:28,870
We´re going across.
Whatever happens, don´t let go.

545
00:40:28,940 --> 00:40:31,135
OK.

546
00:40:31,209 --> 00:40:35,646
<i>Now I realize</i>

552
00:40:54,532 --> 00:40:56,591
l did it! l did it!

553
00:40:56,667 --> 00:41:02,037
<i>- This feels like home. home. home</i>
- Thank you, Kenai.

554
00:41:02,106 --> 00:41:06,941
<i>It feels just like home</i>

555
00:41:20,024 --> 00:41:23,960
Hey, smallish bear.
So where´s big bear?

556
00:41:24,028 --> 00:41:25,757
With Nita.

557
00:41:25,830 --> 00:41:31,268
He never has time for me anymore.
He´s too busy helping her.

558
00:41:31,335 --> 00:41:36,705
Gee, boy, do l know how you feel.
My own brother gave me the heave-ho.

559
00:41:36,774 --> 00:41:42,406
All for a babe.
Actually, two really, really hot babes.

560
00:41:42,480 --> 00:41:45,005
Better watch your brother
doesn´t walk out on you.

561
00:41:47,051 --> 00:41:50,851
- He wouldn´t do that.
- l said the same thing.

562
00:41:50,922 --> 00:41:53,720
But get a load of
Moosanova over there.

563
00:41:53,791 --> 00:41:57,022
Shall l compare thee
to a summer´s dew?

564
00:41:57,094 --> 00:42:00,222
- Did you just make that up?
- Beauty. He´s such a poet.

565
00:42:03,034 --> 00:42:06,367
Yeah, l guess l´ll see you around,
little bear.

566
00:42:28,226 --> 00:42:31,127
- You had a whole clumpful.
- You´re making that up.

567
00:42:31,195 --> 00:42:33,823
All l know is
l had all my fur when we went into the river,

568
00:42:33,898 --> 00:42:35,627
then two handfuls were missing.

569
00:42:35,700 --> 00:42:37,964
- Well, maybe you´re just going bald.
- What?

570
00:42:38,035 --> 00:42:41,402
You know, it does look really thin
right through here.

571
00:42:41,472 --> 00:42:44,032
Yeah, very funny.

572
00:42:44,108 --> 00:42:48,340
This is the most fun l´ve had
since we were kids.

573
00:42:48,412 --> 00:42:50,607
Fun, but cold.

574
00:42:50,681 --> 00:42:54,879
- On a night like this, it´s good to be a bear.
- l bet.

575
00:43:03,394 --> 00:43:06,454
So, Hokani Falls.

576
00:43:07,832 --> 00:43:13,065
- l guess we´ll make it there in time.
- l guess.

577
00:43:13,137 --> 00:43:17,005
A lot sure has changed
since the last time we were there.

578
00:43:17,074 --> 00:43:18,405
No kidding.

579
00:43:20,011 --> 00:43:23,811
Do you ever miss being human?

580
00:43:23,881 --> 00:43:28,375
l mean,
have you ever thought about...

581
00:43:28,452 --> 00:43:30,545
changing back?

582
00:43:35,092 --> 00:43:39,085
Yeah, l´ve...
l´ve thought about it.

583
00:43:39,163 --> 00:43:42,030
l knew it.

584
00:43:42,099 --> 00:43:43,157
Koda.

585
00:43:44,735 --> 00:43:47,727
- You´re going back with her.
- Koda, wait. Koda, wait!

586
00:43:57,214 --> 00:43:59,079
Koda!

587
00:44:03,354 --> 00:44:05,584
Koda, answer me!

588
00:44:24,041 --> 00:44:25,133
Koda!

589
00:44:42,126 --> 00:44:44,117
Hello?

590
00:44:46,330 --> 00:44:49,231
Koda? Are you in here?

591
00:44:57,508 --> 00:45:00,102
Where are you?

592
00:45:00,177 --> 00:45:01,644
Koda?

593
00:45:04,882 --> 00:45:07,715
- Koda?
- Go away.

594
00:45:07,785 --> 00:45:11,243
Koda, Kenai´s worried sick about you.

595
00:45:11,322 --> 00:45:15,281
- Come on, l´ll take you to him.
- No! l said go away.

596
00:45:17,495 --> 00:45:20,760
Koda, please keep your voice down.
lt´s not safe.

597
00:45:20,831 --> 00:45:24,267
l don´t care.
Just leave me alone.

598
00:45:25,870 --> 00:45:29,328
Oh, no. Nita!

599
00:45:29,407 --> 00:45:31,773
We´re gonna be all right,
but we´ve got to go.

600
00:45:32,910 --> 00:45:34,275
Now!

601
00:45:36,580 --> 00:45:40,175
Run! Run! Run! Faster!

602
00:45:43,687 --> 00:45:45,678
We´re gonna make it!

603
00:45:46,924 --> 00:45:49,392
- Nita!
- Take my hand.

604
00:45:59,336 --> 00:46:01,065
Don´t move.

605
00:46:09,914 --> 00:46:11,643
Koda!

606
00:46:11,715 --> 00:46:13,239
Hang on!

607
00:46:15,052 --> 00:46:17,680
Don´t let go!

608
00:46:19,857 --> 00:46:22,417
- Koda! Hold on!
- Watch out!

609
00:46:33,137 --> 00:46:35,628
Koda!

610
00:46:47,985 --> 00:46:52,388
Koda, what would l have done
if anything happened to you?

611
00:46:52,456 --> 00:46:55,619
You´re gonna leave me.

612
00:46:55,693 --> 00:46:59,094
You said you missed being one of them.

613
00:47:08,639 --> 00:47:11,267
You´re going back with her, aren´t you?

614
00:47:12,843 --> 00:47:17,644
l do miss things, but you´re my brother.

615
00:47:17,715 --> 00:47:20,183
l´ll never leave you.

616
00:47:21,819 --> 00:47:23,810
Not ever.

617
00:47:58,489 --> 00:48:01,117
This show´s
giving me the munchies.

618
00:48:01,192 --> 00:48:04,787
Hey, little brother,
how about you get us some twigs?

619
00:48:04,862 --> 00:48:06,591
OK.

620
00:48:07,464 --> 00:48:11,594
- Are you crying?
- No. l mean, well, yeah.

621
00:48:11,669 --> 00:48:16,333
But so what?
These lights are so beautiful. l...

622
00:48:17,007 --> 00:48:19,134
He´s sensitive.

623
00:48:19,210 --> 00:48:24,079
A moose with depth?
lt´s beauty.

624
00:48:24,148 --> 00:48:26,480
- What?
- He´s a cute one, isn´t he?

625
00:48:26,550 --> 00:48:28,950
Hey. l can be sensitive too.

626
00:48:29,753 --> 00:48:31,744
- l like your hooves.
- Really?

627
00:48:31,822 --> 00:48:37,351
Yeah, and l´m a hoof man.
Yours are nice and shiny.

628
00:48:37,428 --> 00:48:41,023
Hoof man?
Why didn´t l think of that?

629
00:49:21,572 --> 00:49:24,234
ls this the equinox?

630
00:49:24,308 --> 00:49:27,334
Yeah, Koda. This is it.

631
00:49:57,941 --> 00:50:00,136
My mom is up there somewhere.

632
00:50:00,210 --> 00:50:02,440
My mom, too.

633
00:50:02,513 --> 00:50:05,607
Do you miss yours?

634
00:50:07,451 --> 00:50:08,941
Yes.

635
00:50:09,687 --> 00:50:14,989
But you don´t need to wait for the lights
to find her, Koda.

636
00:50:15,059 --> 00:50:17,391
She´s always with you.

637
00:50:17,461 --> 00:50:19,326
ln here.

638
00:50:20,130 --> 00:50:22,462
Once you love someone,

639
00:50:22,533 --> 00:50:26,299
they stay in your heart forever.

640
00:50:34,545 --> 00:50:36,536
lt´s time.

641
00:51:22,993 --> 00:51:26,451
Koda, you be good, OK?

642
00:51:27,698 --> 00:51:31,134
You´re such a sweet little cub.

643
00:51:35,773 --> 00:51:37,764
The spell.

644
00:51:51,321 --> 00:51:54,222
Goodbye.

645
00:52:08,138 --> 00:52:11,505
<i>If you hear a voice</i>

646
00:52:11,575 --> 00:52:15,204
<i>In the middle of the night</i>

647
00:52:15,279 --> 00:52:18,271
<i>Saying it´ll be all right</i>

648
00:52:18,348 --> 00:52:21,215
<i>It will be me</i>

649
00:52:21,285 --> 00:52:24,448
<i>If you feel a hand</i>

650
00:52:24,521 --> 00:52:27,547
<i>Guiding you along</i>

651
00:52:27,624 --> 00:52:31,321
<i>When the path seems wrong</i>

652
00:52:31,395 --> 00:52:34,523
<i>It will be me</i>

653
00:52:34,598 --> 00:52:40,696
<i>There is no mountain</i>
<i>that I can´t climb</i>

654
00:52:40,771 --> 00:52:47,472
<i>For you I´d swim</i>
<i>through the rivers of time</i>

655
00:52:47,544 --> 00:52:50,035
<i>As you go your way</i>

656
00:52:50,113 --> 00:52:53,810
<i>And I go mine</i>

657
00:52:53,884 --> 00:52:56,944
<i>A light will shine</i>

658
00:52:57,020 --> 00:53:01,684
<i>And it will be me</i>

659
00:53:03,794 --> 00:53:07,628
<i>It will be me</i>

660
00:53:10,133 --> 00:53:15,127

661
00:53:29,586 --> 00:53:34,421
Kenai, did you give Nita the amulet
because you loved her?

662
00:53:37,728 --> 00:53:43,462
- lt was a long time ago.
- But she´s still with you, in here.

663
00:53:43,534 --> 00:53:45,661
l can tell.

664
00:53:45,736 --> 00:53:49,103
Koda, it doesn´t matter.

665
00:53:50,307 --> 00:53:54,471
Well, if you do love her,
shouldn´t you tell her?

666
00:53:54,545 --> 00:53:58,447
lt´s a little more complicated
than that.

667
00:53:59,182 --> 00:54:02,174
Anyway, it´s over.

668
00:54:02,953 --> 00:54:07,287
Hey, l promised you we´d be
the first two bears to Crowberry Ridge.

669
00:54:07,357 --> 00:54:09,791
Pinky swear, remember?

670
00:54:09,860 --> 00:54:13,990
How about first thing in the morning
we rustle up some more berries?

671
00:54:14,064 --> 00:54:16,498
Sound good?

672
00:54:40,757 --> 00:54:44,193
Mom, Kenai is so sad.

673
00:54:45,195 --> 00:54:47,755
lt´s all because of me.

674
00:54:48,999 --> 00:54:51,729
l´ll be OK on my own.

675
00:54:51,802 --> 00:54:56,136
Tell the spirits to change Kenai back
so he can be happy.

676
00:55:12,689 --> 00:55:14,418
- Jeez, he´s really out.
- Yeah.

677
00:55:14,491 --> 00:55:16,391
Maybe we should
throw water on his face.

678
00:55:16,460 --> 00:55:18,985
Just stand there drooling.
That should do it.

679
00:55:19,062 --> 00:55:23,328
- Trample off.
- Wait. Hey, l think l saw him move.

680
00:55:24,735 --> 00:55:28,967
- Rise and shine, bear boy.
- Yeah, not time to hydroplane yet.

681
00:55:29,039 --> 00:55:32,065
- lt´s hibernate, you hoofer.
- That´s what l said.

682
00:55:32,142 --> 00:55:33,700
We saw smallish bear last night.

683
00:55:33,777 --> 00:55:36,405
We tried to stop him,
but he wouldn´t listen to us.

684
00:55:36,480 --> 00:55:40,917
- What? Where was he going?
- To get Nita.

685
00:55:40,984 --> 00:55:44,681
- Said he´s gonna bring her back for you.
- Bring her back?

686
00:55:44,755 --> 00:55:49,886
No, no, no, no! lf he steps foot
in the village, the hunters will get him.

687
00:55:49,960 --> 00:55:52,622
Aw, jeez!

688
00:55:54,531 --> 00:55:57,967
- Almost there.
- And now for the final touch.

689
00:55:58,035 --> 00:56:02,267
- A beautiful bead necklace.
- No, you don´t. Not this time.

690
00:56:02,339 --> 00:56:04,398
This is much more appropriate.

691
00:56:04,474 --> 00:56:06,772
That doesn´t match anything
she´s wearing.

692
00:56:06,843 --> 00:56:09,073
And what makes you think
those beads do?

693
00:56:09,146 --> 00:56:11,614
Nita, what would make you happy?

694
00:56:17,054 --> 00:56:20,148
Once again, we are ready.

695
00:56:20,223 --> 00:56:21,918
Are you, my daughter?

696
00:56:23,293 --> 00:56:24,624
Yes, Father.

697
00:56:30,600 --> 00:56:35,435
l would expect a bride
to be smiling on her wedding day.

698
00:56:35,505 --> 00:56:37,496
ls there something wrong?

699
00:56:39,743 --> 00:56:42,769
Daddy, l´m so confused.

700
00:56:44,881 --> 00:56:49,477
l thought that when l burned the amulet
the bond would be broken, but...

701
00:56:51,521 --> 00:56:54,581
in my heart, l...

702
00:56:57,060 --> 00:56:59,324
l´m sorry, Daddy.

703
00:57:00,430 --> 00:57:02,660
l can´t marry Atka.

704
00:57:07,904 --> 00:57:09,428
Nita...

705
00:57:09,506 --> 00:57:11,497
A bear!
There´s a bear in the village.

706
00:57:13,610 --> 00:57:16,477
Koda?
Wait! Wait, don´t hurt him!

707
00:57:16,546 --> 00:57:18,639
Oh, no! Our fish!

708
00:57:19,549 --> 00:57:21,949
- l got ´em!
- We´ve got him now.

709
00:57:23,019 --> 00:57:26,045
- Look, he´s up in the tree!
- There he is. Get him.

710
00:57:26,923 --> 00:57:29,619
Don´t! Don´t! Please stop!

711
00:57:31,328 --> 00:57:33,319
Run!

712
00:57:34,531 --> 00:57:35,725
Here he comes!

713
00:57:39,136 --> 00:57:41,070
- Get your spears!
- Come on.

714
00:57:41,138 --> 00:57:43,698
Atka, no!

715
00:57:43,774 --> 00:57:45,332
Leave him alone!

716
00:57:45,408 --> 00:57:47,035
Get him!

717
00:57:51,348 --> 00:57:54,340
- Oh, no! Run!
- Don´t let them get away!

718
00:57:56,419 --> 00:57:58,148
After them!

719
00:57:58,221 --> 00:58:01,247
- Nita! Are you hurt?
- l have to stop them.

720
00:58:03,960 --> 00:58:06,622
There he is! Let´s get him!

721
00:58:10,767 --> 00:58:11,927
Follow me!

722
00:58:14,037 --> 00:58:16,904
Rock! Get out of the way!

723
00:58:20,811 --> 00:58:21,869
Stay low.

724
00:58:23,180 --> 00:58:24,670
Kenai!

725
00:58:36,359 --> 00:58:40,125
There you are. Gotcha!

726
00:58:49,439 --> 00:58:51,339
Nice move.

727
00:58:51,408 --> 00:58:53,239
Beauty.

728
00:58:53,310 --> 00:58:55,335
Our heroes.

729
00:58:56,913 --> 00:58:58,073
Beauty.

730
00:58:58,148 --> 00:59:00,946
Come on. We have to find Kenai.

731
00:59:32,883 --> 00:59:34,646
Kenai!

732
00:59:42,192 --> 00:59:45,286
No, don´t!

733
00:59:50,133 --> 00:59:51,464
Kenai!

734
01:00:05,849 --> 01:00:07,908
- How could you?
- What?

735
01:00:07,984 --> 01:00:09,679
He was my friend.

736
01:00:21,164 --> 01:00:22,358
Kenai?

737
01:00:56,967 --> 01:00:58,559
l can´t...

738
01:00:58,635 --> 01:01:01,069
l don´t understand.
l´m sorry.

739
01:01:19,222 --> 01:01:21,053
l love you, too.

740
01:01:40,643 --> 01:01:42,440
The spirits?

741
01:01:42,512 --> 01:01:46,573
Kenai. l can understand you.

742
01:01:46,649 --> 01:01:50,085
l asked the spirits to turn you
back into a man.

743
01:01:50,153 --> 01:01:52,815
- What?
- So you could be with Nita.

744
01:01:52,889 --> 01:01:55,687
- No, Koda.
- lt´s OK.

745
01:01:55,759 --> 01:01:59,160
l just want you to be happy again.

746
01:02:00,530 --> 01:02:04,125
Nita, l can´t.

747
01:02:10,306 --> 01:02:11,637
But l can.

748
01:02:14,177 --> 01:02:17,772
Am l the only one
that hears these bears speaking?

749
01:02:17,847 --> 01:02:21,112
- Yeah. That´s beauty.
- How´s it going?

750
01:02:21,184 --> 01:02:23,175
Father!

751
01:02:26,790 --> 01:02:29,122
ls this what you want?

752
01:02:30,193 --> 01:02:31,956
Will this make you happy?

753
01:02:36,199 --> 01:02:38,099
You are my daughter,

754
01:02:38,168 --> 01:02:41,467
and l will love you
no matter what you choose.

755
01:03:47,137 --> 01:03:48,126
Nita?

756
01:03:53,977 --> 01:03:55,467
How do l look?

757
01:03:55,545 --> 01:03:59,675
Like a bear.
Except they gave you antlers.

758
01:03:59,749 --> 01:04:01,740
- What?
- Gotcha!

759
01:04:21,237 --> 01:04:23,398
<i>Life is simple and clear</i>

760
01:04:23,473 --> 01:04:28,308
<i>When you make the right choice</i>
<i>it´s truth that you hear</i>

761
01:04:28,378 --> 01:04:30,278
<i>When you find your own voice</i>

762
01:04:30,346 --> 01:04:33,247
<i>Oh. my brothers and sisters. believe</i>

763
01:04:34,350 --> 01:04:38,013
<i>You are just what you are meant to be</i>

764

<i>Oh. great spirits</i>

765
01:04:42,058 --> 01:04:46,995
<i>Hear my voice today</i>

766
01:04:47,063 --> 01:04:50,032
- l love happy endings.
- l love happy endings, too.

767
01:04:50,099 --> 01:04:52,329
And happy beginnings.

768
01:04:52,402 --> 01:04:54,802
- Beauty.
- Beauty.

769
01:05:01,778 --> 01:05:04,178
<i>Look all around you</i>

770
01:05:04,247 --> 01:05:08,479
<i>Welcome. magic</i>

<i>Welcome to this day</i>

778
01:05:55,698 --> 01:05:59,998
<i>Learning how to smile again</i>.
<i>free to show my heart</i>

779
01:06:00,069 --> 01:06:04,506
<i>Knowing I can face the things</i>
<i>that used to seem too hard</i>

780
01:06:04,574 --> 01:06:09,204
<i>I look inside your eyes</i>
<i>and see a different part of me</i>

781
01:06:09,279 --> 01:06:14,717
<i>What I didn´t know I wanted</i>.
<i>now I´ve got everything I need</i>

782
01:06:14,784 --> 01:06:18,550
<i>So many things I´ve been missing</i>.
<i>not watching</i>

783
01:06:18,621 --> 01:06:22,318
<i>But that was all in the past</i>

784
01:06:22,392 --> 01:06:27,022
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to learn</i>

785
01:06:27,096 --> 01:06:31,692
<i>I´m ready for the world</i>.

786
01:06:31,768 --> 01:06:36,398
<i>Now I realize</i>
<i>there´s so much more to feel</i>

787
01:06:36,472 --> 01:06:38,770
<i>And my heart knows it´s real</i>

788
01:06:38,841 --> 01:06:43,301
<i>The part of me so long forgotten</i>

01:08:55,978 --> 01:09:02,281
<i>There is no mountain</i>

820
01:09:02,351 --> 01:09:09,154
<i>For you I´d swim</i>
<i>through the rivers of time</i>

<i>As you go your way</i>

822
01:09:12,161 --> 01:09:15,653
<i>And I go mine</i>

823
01:09:15,731 --> 01:09:18,700
<i>A light will shine</i>

824
01:09:18,768 --> 01:09:22,761
<i>And it will be me</i>

825
01:09:28,344 --> 01:09:34,044
<i>If there is a key</i>
<i>that goes to your heart</i>

826
01:09:35,551 --> 01:09:38,213
<i>A special part</i>

827
01:09:38,287 --> 01:09:41,313
<i>It will be me</i>

828
01:09:41,390 --> 01:09:44,484
<i>If you need a friend</i>

829
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:47,654
<i>Call out to the wind</i>

830
01:09:47,730 --> 01:09:51,325
<i>To hold you again</i>

831
01:09:51,400 --> 01:09:54,369
<i>It will be me</i>

832
01:09:54,437 --> 01:10:00,535
<i>Oh. how the world seems so unfair</i>

833
01:10:00,610 --> 01:10:07,516
<i>Creating a love that cannot be shared</i>

834
01:10:07,583 --> 01:10:10,814
<i>As you go your way</i>
