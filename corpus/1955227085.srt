[Knocking]

5
00:00:42,410 --> 00:00:44,912
I think the pizza guy is here.

6
00:00:45,012 --> 00:00:46,347
So let him in.

7
00:00:46,447 --> 00:00:47,748
Now, you... you guys
know you can get

8
00:00:47,848 --> 00:00:49,283
In serious trouble for this.

9
00:00:49,383 --> 00:00:51,285
You're not supposed to bring
any outside food on campus,

10
00:00:51,385 --> 00:00:52,886
Especially not in the dorms.

11
00:00:52,986 --> 00:00:54,288
What am I supposed to do, man?

12
00:00:54,388 --> 00:00:56,957
I'm tired of the cafeteria
food... same processed

13
00:00:57,057 --> 00:00:58,759
Shit night after night.

14
00:00:58,859 --> 00:01:01,895
Sometimes a man wants a
little Italian up in here.

15
00:01:01,995 --> 00:01:03,864
Yes.

16
00:01:03,964 --> 00:01:05,333
- Hey.
- Hey.

17
00:01:05,433 --> 00:01:06,667
- Come on in.
- All right.

18
00:01:06,767 --> 00:01:07,235
Cool.
Thanks.

19
00:01:10,037 --> 00:01:11,239
All right.

20
00:01:11,339 --> 00:01:13,707
Uh, you got a large
deep dish pizza here...

21
00:01:13,807 --> 00:01:16,277
Hold the garlic, extra sauce.

22
00:01:16,377 --> 00:01:19,012
It'll be, uh, $12.63.

23
00:01:19,113 --> 00:01:19,847
Now hold on.

24
00:01:19,947 --> 00:01:21,415
Hold on.

25
00:01:21,515 --> 00:01:22,850
You guys know all the rules
are here to keep everyone safe.

26
00:01:22,950 --> 00:01:25,519
(LAUGHS) What kind of rules
you guys talking about?

27
00:01:25,619 --> 00:01:28,289
Ah, stupid shit,
man, like uh, them

28
00:01:28,389 --> 00:01:30,558
Not letting us order
pizza on campus.

29
00:01:30,658 --> 00:01:33,327
They won't let you
order a pizza on campus?

30
00:01:33,427 --> 00:01:33,961
Man.

31
00:01:34,061 --> 00:01:35,796
That's harsh.

32
00:01:35,896 --> 00:01:38,098
Looks like you guys don't
care too much about the rules

33
00:01:38,199 --> 00:01:39,233
Though.
Huh?

34
00:01:39,333 --> 00:01:41,502
You don't know the
half of it, man.

35
00:01:41,602 --> 00:01:44,138
Come to think of it, who
are they to say that you

36
00:01:44,238 --> 00:01:45,906
Can't order a pizza on campus?

37
00:01:46,006 --> 00:01:47,241
That's what we've been saying.

38
00:01:47,341 --> 00:01:49,143
I mean, there's something
wrong if you can't

39
00:01:49,243 --> 00:01:50,478
Eat a pizza in your own room.

40
00:01:50,578 --> 00:01:51,312
Huh?

NARRATOR: (EERILY) There's a
place where darkness reigns

43
00:02:37,958 --> 00:02:45,433
And where the gates of
Hell are ripped wide open.

44
00:02:45,533 --> 00:02:54,408
And that place is known
as Doomsday County.

Welcome to Doomsday County.

47
00:03:25,038 --> 00:03:26,707
Come and see the sights.

48
00:03:26,807 --> 00:03:30,311
This place like Hell on Earth,
filled with horror frights.

49
00:03:30,411 --> 00:03:33,714
Down here in Doomsday
County, vampires do exist.

50
00:03:33,814 --> 00:03:37,285
[Inaudible] from a
broken life abyss.

51
00:03:37,385 --> 00:03:39,887
Welcome to Doomsday County.

52
00:03:39,987 --> 00:03:40,888
Whoa.

53
00:03:40,988 --> 00:03:43,257
Welcome to Doomsday County.

54
00:03:43,357 --> 00:03:44,258
Come inside!

55
00:03:44,358 --> 00:03:46,860
Welcome to Doomsday County.

56
00:03:46,960 --> 00:03:47,861
Whoa.

57
00:03:47,961 --> 00:03:50,264
Welcome to Doomsday County.

58
00:03:50,364 --> 00:03:51,432
It's how you die.

63
00:04:55,829 --> 00:04:56,364
Cut!

64
00:04:56,464 --> 00:04:57,230
All right guys.

65
00:04:57,331 --> 00:04:58,832
Good job.

66
00:04:58,932 --> 00:04:59,667
It's a wrap.

67
00:04:59,767 --> 00:05:00,834
Hey, let's get house lights up.

68
00:05:00,934 --> 00:05:02,903
We're done for today.

69
00:05:03,003 --> 00:05:04,938
Everyone, that's a wrap on Joe.

00:05:05,038 --> 00:05:06,173
[Cheering]

71
00:05:06,273 --> 00:05:07,408
And thanks for all the PA's.

72
00:05:07,508 --> 00:05:08,776
Great job.
Good job.

73
00:05:08,876 --> 00:05:09,610
Yeah.

74
00:05:09,710 --> 00:05:11,011
Thanks guys.

75
00:05:11,111 --> 00:05:11,845
All right.

76
00:05:11,945 --> 00:05:13,213
Listen up.

77
00:05:13,313 --> 00:05:15,383
You should all be about finished
with your final project now.

78
00:05:15,483 --> 00:05:17,551
From what I heard in there
it sounded pretty good.

79
00:05:17,651 --> 00:05:19,553
Um, all you have to
do is get it edited

80
00:05:19,653 --> 00:05:21,422
And back to me by next class.

81
00:05:21,522 --> 00:05:22,923
So I want you to start
cleaning everything

82
00:05:23,023 --> 00:05:24,024
Up and listen for attendance.

83
00:05:24,124 --> 00:05:25,759
OK?

84
00:05:25,859 --> 00:05:27,428
Holy fucking shit!

85
00:05:27,528 --> 00:05:30,263
There is no doubt
that we are the best

86
00:05:30,364 --> 00:05:33,266
Class at Doomsday Tech.

87
00:05:33,367 --> 00:05:35,603
Nobody comes close.

88
00:05:35,703 --> 00:05:38,406
No one's going to break us down.

89
00:05:38,506 --> 00:05:39,873
We are so strong.

90
00:05:39,973 --> 00:05:42,242
Our lighting is so good.

91
00:05:42,342 --> 00:05:46,747
I'm so proud of you, my
brothers and sisters.

92
00:05:46,847 --> 00:05:49,883
I... [groan].

93
00:05:49,983 --> 00:05:52,686
It's assholes like that
that give us a bad name!

94
00:05:58,959 --> 00:06:00,060
Damn, Paul.

95
00:06:00,160 --> 00:06:00,894
PROFESSOR: Mark.

96
00:06:00,994 --> 00:06:01,962
Here.

97
00:06:02,062 --> 00:06:03,464
Why you always got
to mess everything up?

98
00:06:09,403 --> 00:06:12,039
Eric!

99
00:06:12,139 --> 00:06:14,274
Paul blew out the Xenon bulb.

100
00:06:14,374 --> 00:06:15,476
All right.

101
00:06:15,576 --> 00:06:16,810
I'll be right out.

102
00:06:28,556 --> 00:06:32,460
All right, uh, who's got gloves?

103
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,061
I'm kind of glad this
happened because it'll

104
00:06:34,161 --> 00:06:35,128
Give me a chance
to show you guys

105
00:06:35,228 --> 00:06:36,864
How to change the Xenon bulb.

106
00:06:36,964 --> 00:06:38,999
You want to be really
careful with these one,

107
00:06:39,099 --> 00:06:42,069
Because they're hot, and two,
because they're explosive.

108
00:06:42,169 --> 00:06:44,237
They're actually filled
with a poisonous gas that

109
00:06:44,337 --> 00:06:45,873
Could be fatal if inhale it.

110
00:06:45,973 --> 00:06:48,075
So you want to be really
careful with them.

111
00:06:48,175 --> 00:06:49,342
Um.

112
00:06:49,443 --> 00:06:50,578
I don't personally
know what would happen

113
00:06:50,678 --> 00:06:51,745
If we dropped one
of these, so let's

114
00:06:51,845 --> 00:06:53,013
Be safe and let's be smart.

115
00:06:53,113 --> 00:06:53,847
OK?

116
00:06:59,286 --> 00:07:00,754

Guys, we got a
class at 1:00, right?

122
00:07:45,666 --> 00:07:46,800
Yeah.
Why?

123
00:07:46,900 --> 00:07:47,467
What time is it?

124
00:07:47,568 --> 00:07:49,002
Five til 1:00.

125
00:07:49,102 --> 00:07:49,803
Shit.
Oh.

126
00:07:49,903 --> 00:07:50,871
We got to get going.
No.

127
00:07:50,971 --> 00:07:52,005
No.
No.

128
00:07:52,105 --> 00:07:54,007
The other... the other
class hasn't left yet.

129
00:07:54,107 --> 00:07:55,142
- Are you sure?
- Yeah.

130
00:07:55,242 --> 00:07:56,777
I've been sitting here
an hour, and, uh, they

131
00:07:56,877 --> 00:07:58,211
Always come through the door.

132
00:07:58,311 --> 00:08:00,548
So I think they're still
working on the zombie movie.

133
00:08:00,648 --> 00:08:03,517
Hey, well, ladies, I'm going
to go see what's going on.

134
00:08:12,626 --> 00:08:13,561
Oh, cool.

135
00:08:13,661 --> 00:08:14,828
They're using the fire machine.

136
00:08:34,081 --> 00:08:34,815
Hey.

137
00:08:34,915 --> 00:08:35,916
Hey, buddy.

138
00:08:36,016 --> 00:08:37,918
Are you in this, uh,
advanced lighting class?

139
00:08:40,353 --> 00:08:45,292
Oh, my fault. I didn't realize
you guys were still filming.

140
00:08:45,392 --> 00:08:46,694
Oh, sweet.

141
00:08:46,794 --> 00:08:49,362
You guys got some kickass
makeup for this shoot.

142
00:08:49,462 --> 00:08:50,197
[Zap]

143
00:08:50,297 --> 00:08:51,031
Oh, sick.

144
00:08:51,131 --> 00:08:52,065
Oh, man.

145
00:08:52,165 --> 00:08:52,766
Whew.

146
00:08:52,866 --> 00:08:55,368
Really, where's Eric?

147
00:08:55,468 --> 00:08:56,637
Damn.

148
00:08:56,737 --> 00:08:58,505
You guys are uh, really
getting into this.

149
00:08:58,606 --> 00:08:59,339
Should be awesome.

150
00:09:02,075 --> 00:09:03,276
Oh, man.

151
00:09:03,376 --> 00:09:05,579
Eric, I didn't know you were
working on this with them.

152
00:09:05,679 --> 00:09:09,049
Dude, is that real
glass in your neck?

153
00:09:09,149 --> 00:09:11,318
[Mm]

154
00:09:11,418 --> 00:09:12,720
Holy shit!

155
00:09:12,820 --> 00:09:14,121
That was really in your neck.

[Gurgle sounds]

157
00:09:31,639 --> 00:09:34,507
Did anyone hear that?

158
00:09:34,608 --> 00:09:36,076
Hear what?

159
00:09:36,176 --> 00:09:38,178
That screaming.

160
00:09:38,278 --> 00:09:42,650
I heard a scream coming
from the lab room.

161
00:09:42,750 --> 00:09:44,685
Advanced Lighting's still
working on the zombie movie.

162
00:09:44,785 --> 00:09:45,886
That's why we're waiting.

163
00:09:48,756 --> 00:09:51,224
Is Billy still in there?

164
00:09:51,324 --> 00:09:54,261
Monica likes Billy.

165
00:09:54,361 --> 00:09:55,262
Shut up.

166
00:10:15,548 --> 00:10:16,283
Hello!

167
00:10:18,618 --> 00:10:19,352
Eric?

00:10:25,492 --> 00:10:26,226
Anybody?

Billy?

170
00:10:36,970 --> 00:10:37,738
Billy!

171
00:10:42,109 --> 00:10:42,843
Billy!

172
00:10:47,948 --> 00:10:50,918
Billy, is that you?

173
00:10:55,756 --> 00:10:56,489
Come on, Billy.

174
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:57,324
This isn't funny.

175
00:11:07,735 --> 00:11:09,369
Hello?

176
00:11:09,469 --> 00:11:10,237
Anybody!

177
00:11:13,306 --> 00:11:15,608
Hello!

178
00:11:15,709 --> 00:11:19,179

182
00:11:43,971 --> 00:11:45,105
Good morning, filmmakers.

183
00:11:49,509 --> 00:11:54,181
Now, if everyone can open
a Microsoft Word document,

184
00:11:54,281 --> 00:11:56,249
We can start.

185
00:11:56,349 --> 00:11:57,517
All right.

186
00:11:57,617 --> 00:12:01,521
Today we are continuing
our hero cycle.

187
00:12:01,621 --> 00:12:03,590
So for our...

188
00:12:03,690 --> 00:12:06,193
Hey, Taps.

189
00:12:06,293 --> 00:12:08,728
Everyone, this is Mike.

190
00:12:08,829 --> 00:12:12,065
He's working in
lighting right now.

191
00:12:12,165 --> 00:12:14,201
And he's going to talk
to us about the project

192
00:12:14,301 --> 00:12:15,035
They're working on.

193
00:12:15,135 --> 00:12:16,436
Hey guys.

194
00:12:16,536 --> 00:12:18,171
Like he said, I'm Mike and I'm
in lighting, and uh, right now

195
00:12:18,271 --> 00:12:20,073
We're working on our final
project, which is a short film.

196
00:12:20,173 --> 00:12:21,641
But we're going to
need some help with it.

197
00:12:21,741 --> 00:12:25,212
So if anyone wants to come down
and PA... that's a Production

198
00:12:25,312 --> 00:12:27,680
Assistant for those of you
who might not know... um,

199
00:12:27,781 --> 00:12:29,482
We got a sign up sheet
in the lighting room

200
00:12:29,582 --> 00:12:31,051
Over in building two.

201
00:12:31,151 --> 00:12:32,285
Thanks.

202
00:12:32,385 --> 00:12:33,686
Thanks, Mike.

203
00:12:33,787 --> 00:12:36,857
PA work is actually a good way
to get your foot in the door.

204
00:12:36,957 --> 00:12:42,329
So during the break I recommend
you walk over and sign up.

205
00:12:42,429 --> 00:12:43,630
Anyway...

206
00:12:43,730 --> 00:12:45,765
Aw, man, I thought I
was going to be late.

207
00:12:45,866 --> 00:12:46,733
Well, you are.

208
00:12:46,834 --> 00:12:47,935
We all are.

209
00:12:48,035 --> 00:12:49,002
Advanced Lighting
is still in there

210

Working on their zombie movie.

211
00:12:51,138 --> 00:12:52,639
Class got out like 20 minutes.

212
00:12:52,739 --> 00:12:54,875
Should we go check it out?

213
00:12:54,975 --> 00:12:57,544
Billy and Monica went
to check it out already.

214
00:12:57,644 --> 00:12:58,812
They're not back yet?

215
00:13:01,281 --> 00:13:02,916
(LAUGHING) I
didn't even notice.

216
00:13:03,016 --> 00:13:04,151
All right.
I've had enough.

217
00:13:04,251 --> 00:13:04,985
I'm going in.

218
00:13:14,161 --> 00:13:14,895

Look.

226
00:14:19,359 --> 00:14:21,228
They can't come in
because of the sign.

227
00:14:21,328 --> 00:14:23,463
We're safe as long as
we're in this room.

228
00:14:23,563 --> 00:14:24,631
Is everybody all right?

229
00:14:24,731 --> 00:14:25,899
What are those things?

230
00:14:25,999 --> 00:14:27,400
They look like zombies,
but I'm not sure.

231
00:14:27,500 --> 00:14:28,268
How did they get here?

232
00:14:28,368 --> 00:14:30,870
I don't know.

233
00:14:30,971 --> 00:14:33,340
Where is the other
lighting class?

234
00:14:33,440 --> 00:14:34,207
Goddammit.

235
00:14:34,307 --> 00:14:35,475
I don't know.

236
00:14:35,575 --> 00:14:39,512
Just shut the fuck up for
a second and let me think.

237
00:14:39,612 --> 00:14:43,116
[Sigh] Was anyone bitten?

238
00:14:43,216 --> 00:14:44,817
What?

239
00:14:44,918 --> 00:14:45,785
Bitten.

240
00:14:45,885 --> 00:14:47,454
Were either of you bitten?

241
00:14:47,554 --> 00:14:50,557
If those things out there
are zombies and either of you

242
00:14:50,657 --> 00:14:53,593
Were bitten, you
get the picture.

243
00:14:53,693 --> 00:14:55,495
I was.

244
00:14:55,595 --> 00:14:58,665

246
00:15:00,367 --> 00:15:02,069
What... what if
they're not zombies?

247
00:15:02,169 --> 00:15:05,038
Hey, ass kitchen, you telling
me those things aren't zombies?

248
00:15:05,138 --> 00:15:08,575
They don't look like any
zombie I've seen in a movie.

249
00:15:08,675 --> 00:15:10,377
I'm sorry.

250
00:15:10,477 --> 00:15:12,012
I thought I told you
to shut the fuck up.

251
00:15:12,112 --> 00:15:12,946
What happened to that?

252
00:15:13,046 --> 00:15:15,582
Calm the fuck down.

[Yelling]

254
00:15:20,087 --> 00:15:21,121
So what are we going to do?

255
00:15:23,656 --> 00:15:24,424
Kill me.

256
00:15:27,594 --> 00:15:28,461
What?

257
00:15:28,561 --> 00:15:29,162
You heard me.

258
00:15:29,262 --> 00:15:30,430
Just get... just do it.

259
00:15:35,702 --> 00:15:36,836
Are you sure?

260
00:15:36,936 --> 00:15:38,938
Even if we get
out of this alive,

261
00:15:39,039 --> 00:15:40,507
I'm still failing this class.

262
00:15:40,607 --> 00:15:46,113
So you can either kill me now
or my parents will. [Laughs]

263
00:16:29,456 --> 00:16:31,724
I can't.

265
00:16:44,637 --> 00:16:45,305
OK.

266
00:16:45,405 --> 00:16:46,839
We'll take our break now.

267
00:16:46,939 --> 00:16:50,410
Go on over to the lighting
class and sign up for PA work.

268
00:16:50,510 --> 00:16:51,111
OK.

269
00:16:51,211 --> 00:16:52,612
Be back in 30 minutes.

Hey.

271
00:17:13,100 --> 00:17:16,103
So what did you find?

272
00:17:16,203 --> 00:17:17,504
Night school?

273
00:17:17,604 --> 00:17:20,440
What's the name of it?

274
00:17:20,540 --> 00:17:21,708
No.

275

Never heard of it.

276
00:17:24,043 --> 00:17:26,579
Well, I'll take
whatever I can get.

277
00:17:26,679 --> 00:17:28,181
Yeah.

278
00:17:28,281 --> 00:17:30,450
This place is going to
be the end of me one day.

Hello.

Still at the lighting

And get them back here?

373
00:24:05,545 --> 00:24:11,551
Well, I just better have
some fucking pork chops

374
00:24:11,651 --> 00:24:13,820
When we get into that kitchen!

375
00:24:13,920 --> 00:24:16,856
Because if I don't
have my chops...

376
00:24:16,956 --> 00:24:17,857
You're scaring me.

377
00:24:17,957 --> 00:24:18,858
Please.

378
00:24:18,958 --> 00:24:20,627
May.

379
00:24:20,727 --> 00:24:21,260
May!

380
00:24:25,331 --> 00:24:27,834
[Squish]

381
00:24:47,720 --> 00:24:50,690
I have another job offer
at a different school

382
00:24:50,790 --> 00:24:53,259
At one hopefully that
isn't filled with monsters.

383
00:24:53,359 --> 00:24:54,093
Yeah.

384
00:24:54,193 --> 00:24:55,562
Excuse me.

385
00:24:55,662 --> 00:24:59,532
There you have it, Mr.
Eddie Tapia, hero of Doomsday

386
00:24:59,632 --> 00:25:01,901
County... [inaudible].

387
00:25:28,194 --> 00:25:29,662
[Record scratch]

388
00:25:44,977 --> 00:25:45,712
Jack and Coke.

389
00:25:53,419 --> 00:25:54,320
That's not how I like it.

390
00:25:54,420 --> 00:25:55,321
Really?

391
00:25:55,421 --> 00:25:56,455
Well, that's how I make it.

392
00:25:56,555 --> 00:25:59,058
Make it again.

393
00:25:59,158 --> 00:26:00,359
Listen, motherfucker.

394
00:26:00,459 --> 00:26:01,928
Unless you want
pieces of your teeth

395
00:26:02,028 --> 00:26:06,098
In that drink, that's the
way you're going to drink it.

396
00:26:06,198 --> 00:26:07,800
Let me tell you a story.

397
00:26:07,900 --> 00:26:11,771
It's about a man who was
minding his business... minding

398
00:26:11,871 --> 00:26:14,373
His business and
tending to his business,

399
00:26:14,473 --> 00:26:17,977
When someone shit in his cereal.

400
00:26:18,077 --> 00:26:22,014
Now this man... he liked his
cereal just the way it was.

401
00:26:22,114 --> 00:26:24,250
(YELLING) But that
didn't matter anymore

402
00:26:24,350 --> 00:26:26,118
Because he had no power!

403
00:26:26,218 --> 00:26:28,855
No fucking power!

404
00:26:28,955 --> 00:26:31,457
Now this little
piggy... he came home,

405
00:26:31,557 --> 00:26:34,126
And all he wanted
was a Jack and Coke.

406
00:26:34,226 --> 00:26:36,295
And you know what he got?

407
00:26:36,395 --> 00:26:42,368
He got the distinct taste of
shit in his fucking cereal!

408
00:26:42,468 --> 00:26:45,938
[Yelling]

409
00:26:53,379 --> 00:26:54,881
[Gunshot]

410
00:26:56,749 --> 00:26:58,217
[Gunshot]

411
00:27:01,320 --> 00:27:02,188
[Ah]

412
00:27:02,288 --> 00:27:05,758
[Grunts and groans]

413
00:27:12,999 --> 00:27:15,735
I can't leave you alone
for five seconds, Chop.

414
00:27:15,835 --> 00:27:17,737
Just fucking shoot him.

415
00:27:17,837 --> 00:27:22,108
Asshole, you get up, you're
going to get lead in you.

416
00:27:22,208 --> 00:27:23,042
You OK, Chops?

417
00:27:23,142 --> 00:27:23,876
Behind you!

418
00:27:33,185 --> 00:27:33,720
[Gunshot]

419
00:27:33,820 --> 00:27:35,287
[Shells clanking]

420
00:27:36,388 --> 00:27:38,624
Aw.

421
00:27:38,725 --> 00:27:40,259
Martin, are you OK?

422
00:27:40,359 --> 00:27:41,160
Monty.

423
00:27:41,260 --> 00:27:42,261
Monty, give me your arm.

424
00:27:42,361 --> 00:27:45,131
What the fuck?

425
00:27:45,231 --> 00:27:47,767
Easy.

426
00:27:47,867 --> 00:27:49,601
I told you to just
fucking shoot him.

427
00:27:49,702 --> 00:27:51,237
Well, I didn't know how
much you had to drink

428
00:27:51,337 --> 00:27:52,104
While I was taking a piss!

429
00:27:54,673 --> 00:27:57,509
Jesus Christ.

430
00:27:57,609 --> 00:27:58,911
I'm going to call the boys.

431
00:27:59,011 --> 00:27:59,545
Damn.

432
00:27:59,645 --> 00:28:00,747
Look at this guy.

433
00:28:04,650 --> 00:28:08,120
[Sirens]

434
00:28:21,167 --> 00:28:22,234
Jesus.

435
00:28:22,334 --> 00:28:24,971
Chops, this guy this
ugly before you shot him?

436
00:28:25,071 --> 00:28:27,339
Well, I wouldn't mistake
him for Brad Pitt,

437
00:28:27,439 --> 00:28:28,875
But he wasn't this bad.

438
00:28:28,975 --> 00:28:30,777
This guy definitely
is allergic to lead.

439
00:28:30,877 --> 00:28:35,681
He looks like a...
A moldy sponge.

440
00:28:35,782 --> 00:28:36,515
Yeah.

441
00:28:36,615 --> 00:28:37,784
Well, you know what?

442
00:28:37,884 --> 00:28:39,752
Let's just see who
Sponge Bob really is.

443
00:28:42,521 --> 00:28:43,255
Here.

444
00:28:43,355 --> 00:28:44,590
Catch.

445
00:28:44,690 --> 00:28:47,026
Chops.

446
00:28:47,126 --> 00:28:48,394
All right.
Here comes the Chief.

447
00:28:48,494 --> 00:28:49,395
Put it back.

448
00:28:49,495 --> 00:28:51,297
Holy shit!

449
00:28:51,397 --> 00:28:53,565
Now we need a clean
up crew even when

450
00:28:53,665 --> 00:28:55,234
You guys are off the clock!

451
00:28:55,334 --> 00:28:57,703
What the fuck is
wrong with you guys?

452
00:28:57,804 --> 00:28:59,705
Chief, if we weren't
here, this would

453
00:28:59,806 --> 00:29:01,140
Be a lot worse than what it is.

454
00:29:01,240 --> 00:29:02,441
Ah.

455
00:29:02,541 --> 00:29:05,377
Shit just seems to follow
you two knuckleheads around,

456
00:29:05,477 --> 00:29:07,513
And I'm sick of it!

457
00:29:07,613 --> 00:29:10,216
Yet again you shoot first!

458
00:29:10,316 --> 00:29:12,018
You don't even give
the poor son of a bitch

459
00:29:12,118 --> 00:29:15,187
A chance to answer
questions later!

460
00:29:15,287 --> 00:29:17,857
So here we've got a
man who could've spent

461
00:29:17,957 --> 00:29:20,359
The night in the drunk tank.

462
00:29:20,459 --> 00:29:21,727
But oh, no.

463
00:29:21,828 --> 00:29:25,064
Thanks to you two
numb-nuts, what have we got?

464
00:29:25,164 --> 00:29:27,533
Another bullet-ridden
corpse for us to clean.

465
00:29:27,633 --> 00:29:36,308
[Blah] [cough] Why don't you
two make yourself useful?

466
00:29:36,408 --> 00:29:39,345
Go try to solve a case
you've been assigned

467
00:29:39,445 --> 00:29:42,815
And stop giving me new ones.

468
00:29:42,915 --> 00:29:46,452
Somebody get me an
idea on this guy!

469
00:29:46,552 --> 00:29:48,654
You know, you ought to tell
the chief to add a little

470
00:29:48,754 --> 00:29:50,356
More fiber to his diet.

471
00:29:50,456 --> 00:29:51,790
Fiber?

472
00:29:51,891 --> 00:29:53,459
That guy could eat a fucking
oak tree for breakfast

473
00:29:53,559 --> 00:29:54,360
And still be an asshole.

474
00:30:04,303 --> 00:30:05,171
Hey, Willie.

475
00:30:05,271 --> 00:30:06,939
How you feeling?

476
00:30:07,039 --> 00:30:08,941
You know me, boss.

477
00:30:09,041 --> 00:30:10,509
I'll be all right.

478
00:30:14,346 --> 00:30:16,748
I want you to keep us
posted on his condition.

479
00:30:16,849 --> 00:30:18,017
Will do.

480
00:30:18,117 --> 00:30:19,385
Just get in touch
with me or my partner.

481
00:30:19,485 --> 00:30:20,752
We're both on there.

482
00:30:20,853 --> 00:30:22,321
Thanks.

483
00:30:22,421 --> 00:30:23,722
Come on, buddy.

484
00:30:23,822 --> 00:30:24,623
Hang in there, Willie.

485
00:30:24,723 --> 00:30:25,457
We'll see you soon.

486
00:30:25,557 --> 00:30:26,792
OK?

487
00:30:26,893 --> 00:30:27,994
Take care, man.

488
00:30:41,607 --> 00:30:42,741
Got to do some laundry.

489
00:30:42,841 --> 00:30:44,310
[Sigh]

490
00:30:56,855 --> 00:30:58,090
What are you thinking?

491
00:30:58,190 --> 00:31:01,293
I'm thinking that guy
was pretty sick looking.

492
00:31:01,393 --> 00:31:06,098
And whatever he had
better not be contagious.

493
00:31:06,198 --> 00:31:08,400
And I'm also thinking I want
to know as soon as possible

494
00:31:08,500 --> 00:31:09,301
If I'm right.

495
00:31:18,510 --> 00:31:20,646
What's the address?

496
00:31:20,746 --> 00:31:25,684
Jacob Warren, 493 Arbor Drive.

497
00:31:25,784 --> 00:31:28,787
And what's between
there and here?

498
00:31:28,887 --> 00:31:30,322
Nothing.

499
00:31:30,422 --> 00:31:32,424
Great.

500
00:31:32,524 --> 00:31:35,127
But there's a Dunkin'
Donuts right after.

501
00:31:37,863 --> 00:31:38,597
Done.

502
00:31:38,697 --> 00:31:48,774
[Laughs]

503
00:31:48,874 --> 00:31:49,675
Yeah.

504
00:31:49,775 --> 00:31:51,777
Well, this is the place.

505
00:31:51,877 --> 00:31:53,579
Not a bad-looking home.

506
00:31:53,679 --> 00:31:54,813
Not at all.

507
00:31:54,913 --> 00:31:56,348
As a matter of fact,
this is the place

508
00:31:56,448 --> 00:31:58,517
That Lacie and I looked at
when we first moved down here.

509
00:31:58,617 --> 00:31:59,351
Oh, yeah?

510
00:32:04,823 --> 00:32:06,225
Yeah.

511
00:32:06,325 --> 00:32:07,826
I remember all of this was
under development back then.

512
00:32:07,926 --> 00:32:11,663
But the prices were really good,
but we still couldn't swing it.

513
00:32:11,763 --> 00:32:15,901
I don't know about you,
but I still can't swing it.

514
00:32:16,002 --> 00:32:16,935
You know what you should do?

515
00:32:17,036 --> 00:32:18,537
You should call my cousin Tommy.

516
00:32:18,637 --> 00:32:20,739
He's a really good Realtor.

517
00:32:20,839 --> 00:32:22,208
Tommy?

518
00:32:22,308 --> 00:32:23,742
Tommy, I got caught
with the curling

519
00:32:23,842 --> 00:32:26,745
Irons up my ass at last year's
New Years Eve party Tommy?

520
00:32:29,315 --> 00:32:30,682
The guy had his
moments, I admit it.

521
00:32:30,782 --> 00:32:32,784
But all strange tendencies
aside, the guy's a genius

522
00:32:32,884 --> 00:32:33,752
When it comes to this shit.

523
00:32:33,852 --> 00:32:35,054
Well, yeah.

524
00:32:35,154 --> 00:32:37,456
He's clearly some kind
of Renaissance man.

525
00:32:37,556 --> 00:32:40,759
He's also the same guy that
paid our very expensive bar tab

526
00:32:40,859 --> 00:32:41,960
Two years ago, French Quarter.

527
00:32:42,061 --> 00:32:43,095
Remember?

528
00:32:43,195 --> 00:32:44,296
This is also the
guy who got caught

529
00:32:44,396 --> 00:32:46,198
With a curling iron up his ass.

530
00:32:49,501 --> 00:32:50,902
Anything?

531
00:32:51,003 --> 00:32:51,837
Oh my god!

532
00:32:51,937 --> 00:32:52,871
What?

533
00:32:52,971 --> 00:32:55,874
This curling iron's everywhere!

534
00:32:55,974 --> 00:32:57,176
Fine.

535
00:32:57,276 --> 00:32:58,777
Keep living limit in
the slum you live in.

536
00:32:58,877 --> 00:33:01,147
You will never know the joys of
living in a good neighborhood.

537
00:33:01,247 --> 00:33:04,516
[Glass shattering]

538
00:33:15,561 --> 00:33:16,395
You know, you're right.

539
00:33:16,495 --> 00:33:17,929
You should give
old Tommy a call.

540
00:33:18,030 --> 00:33:20,466
This really is a nice
neighborhood. [Snickers]

541
00:33:20,566 --> 00:33:21,633
Come on.

542
00:33:21,733 --> 00:33:22,468
(WHISPERING) Asshole.

543
00:33:28,940 --> 00:33:31,843
Go ahead.

544
00:33:31,943 --> 00:33:34,846
Pussy.

545
00:33:34,946 --> 00:33:36,014
What?

546
00:33:36,115 --> 00:33:37,849
Don't forget to
take your shoes off.

547
00:33:37,949 --> 00:33:41,453
Fuck you.

548
00:33:41,553 --> 00:33:44,423
Ugh.

549
00:33:44,523 --> 00:33:46,158
[Grunts] Oh, shit!

550
00:33:49,027 --> 00:33:50,162
Chops!

551
00:33:50,262 --> 00:33:53,099
Feel free to jump in
at any [ugh] time!

552
00:33:58,570 --> 00:34:00,439
[Growl]

553
00:34:00,539 --> 00:34:03,809
[Grunting]

554
00:34:03,909 --> 00:34:07,379
[Growling]

555
00:34:17,556 --> 00:34:18,157
Mikey!

556
00:34:18,257 --> 00:34:19,691
Mikey, where are you?

557
00:34:22,528 --> 00:34:23,262
Mikey!

558
00:34:27,733 --> 00:34:29,000
Ah!

[Growling]

561
00:34:58,830 --> 00:35:01,333
It's all right.

562
00:35:01,433 --> 00:35:02,134
Oh, man.

563
00:35:02,234 --> 00:35:03,169
You got it.

565
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:29,695
Yeah.

566
00:35:29,795 --> 00:35:31,062
It's Chops.

567
00:35:31,163 --> 00:35:33,131
You better get a
team down to 493

568
00:35:33,232 --> 00:35:37,002
Harbor with mops and buckets.

569
00:35:37,102 --> 00:35:38,404
Yeah.

570
00:35:38,504 --> 00:35:39,605
Tell the chief we're sorry
we couldn't hang around.

571
00:35:39,705 --> 00:35:41,340
We had to go make
a mess elsewhere.

572
00:35:41,440 --> 00:35:43,742
Yeah, we've got a TV.

573
00:35:43,842 --> 00:35:44,743
Hang on.

574
00:35:52,050 --> 00:35:53,419
This is Patricia
Watts and Patty

575
00:35:53,519 --> 00:35:56,388
Watts with great big news.

576
00:35:56,488 --> 00:35:59,791
The reports of violent
outbreaking in Doomsday County

577
00:35:59,891 --> 00:36:01,927
Have been confirmed.

578
00:36:02,027 --> 00:36:05,297
The Doomsday Police Department
have stated that these attacks

579
00:36:05,397 --> 00:36:07,533
Are true and having
an increasing

580
00:36:07,633 --> 00:36:11,837
Both in number and ferocity
over the last two hours.

581
00:36:11,937 --> 00:36:15,173
There are numerous that
these acts of violence

582
00:36:15,274 --> 00:36:17,309
Are somehow linked
to a virus that's

583
00:36:17,409 --> 00:36:19,077
Spreading through the area.

584
00:36:19,177 --> 00:36:21,313
Witness to the
occurring have stated

585
00:36:21,413 --> 00:36:24,750
That the assailants
are sickly and rabid

586
00:36:24,850 --> 00:36:26,385
In appearance and demeanor.

587
00:36:26,485 --> 00:36:30,088
There is some speculation
as to whether this is at all

588
00:36:30,188 --> 00:36:32,791
Connected to the
Doomsday Tech Massacre

589
00:36:32,891 --> 00:36:36,662
Where faulty Xenon bulbs
were apparently to blame.

590
00:36:36,762 --> 00:36:40,999
And in a related story,
Z.O of Mongoo Industries

591
00:36:41,099 --> 00:36:43,435
Has mysteriously disappeared.

592
00:36:43,535 --> 00:36:46,272
The eccentric
scientist Dr. Mongoo

593
00:36:46,372 --> 00:36:47,973
Is wanted for
questioning concerning

594
00:36:48,073 --> 00:36:51,910
The Doomsday Tech incident
as well as a violent outbreak

595
00:36:52,010 --> 00:36:53,279
Of this evening.

596

Channel 6, Doomsday.

597
00:36:55,747 --> 00:36:56,415
Yeah.

598
00:36:56,515 --> 00:36:57,849
We'll be in touch, Matty.

599
00:36:57,949 --> 00:37:00,586
We're going to keep looking
into this thing deeper.

600
00:37:00,686 --> 00:37:01,887
Do me a favor.

601
00:37:01,987 --> 00:37:03,755
Keep the Chief at bay.

602
00:37:03,855 --> 00:37:04,656
All right?

603
00:37:04,756 --> 00:37:05,491
Thanks.

604
00:37:10,228 --> 00:37:11,330
You ready?

605
00:37:15,166 --> 00:37:16,802
Are you enjoying your sandwich?

606
00:37:16,902 --> 00:37:17,669
No.

607
00:37:17,769 --> 00:37:18,637
It's OK, bro.

608
00:37:18,737 --> 00:37:19,471
Please.

609
00:37:26,077 --> 00:37:29,548

610
00:37:40,359 --> 00:37:42,294
I am your friend.

[Laughing]

612
00:37:57,843 --> 00:37:59,010
Now escape.

613
00:37:59,110 --> 00:38:00,612
No more escape.

614
00:38:00,712 --> 00:38:03,949
[Laughing]

615
00:38:05,617 --> 00:38:06,785
Power!

616
00:38:06,885 --> 00:38:10,589
I must have power... power
over their pathetic minds

617
00:38:10,689 --> 00:38:15,126
That puts control over every
thought... that every action.

618
00:38:15,226 --> 00:38:16,395
No escape.

619
00:38:16,495 --> 00:38:20,766
No more running
[inaudible] on my control.

620
00:38:20,866 --> 00:38:22,300
Soon, my friends.

621
00:38:22,401 --> 00:38:25,904
Soon I will have their power.

622
00:38:26,004 --> 00:38:31,242
You will do my bidding...
My bidding of old.

623
00:38:31,343 --> 00:38:33,044
No escape.

624
00:38:33,144 --> 00:38:35,246
No escape.

625
00:38:35,347 --> 00:38:36,582
[Laughs] There.

626
00:38:36,682 --> 00:38:40,386
That should do the trick.

627
00:38:40,486 --> 00:38:42,654
Now out you go, my friend.

628
00:38:42,754 --> 00:38:44,155
Time to play.

629
00:38:44,255 --> 00:38:45,991
No escape.

630
00:38:46,091 --> 00:38:47,526
I am your friend.

631
00:38:47,626 --> 00:38:48,827
They are your enemies.

632
00:39:41,179 --> 00:39:41,913
OK.

633
00:39:42,013 --> 00:39:44,082
We got one up front.

634
00:39:44,182 --> 00:39:46,017
Doesn't get much
better back here.

635
00:39:46,117 --> 00:39:46,918
Take a look.

636
00:39:47,018 --> 00:39:47,819
Yeah.

637
00:39:47,919 --> 00:39:48,987
Well, that's two.

638
00:39:49,087 --> 00:39:49,988
Means we're still missing one.

639
00:39:55,093 --> 00:39:56,394
Chops, I don't like it.

640
00:39:56,495 --> 00:39:57,395
We haven't seen a car.

641
00:39:57,496 --> 00:39:59,097
We haven't seen a person.

642
00:39:59,197 --> 00:40:02,934
For Christ sakes, we haven't
seen a dog for hours.

643
00:40:03,034 --> 00:40:05,370
And we haven't heard
from any cops either.

644
00:40:05,471 --> 00:40:06,905
What's really got
me surprised is

645
00:40:07,005 --> 00:40:08,774
We haven't heard from the
asshole since we let the bar.

646
00:40:16,782 --> 00:40:17,315
Huh.

647
00:40:17,415 --> 00:40:19,718
Speak of a devil.

648
00:40:19,818 --> 00:40:20,719
Yeah.

649
00:40:20,819 --> 00:40:21,787
CHIEF (ON PHONE):
Where are you two?

650
00:40:21,887 --> 00:40:23,254
We're headed to
Doomsday County.

651
00:40:23,354 --> 00:40:24,856
We think there might
be something there.

652
00:40:24,956 --> 00:40:26,858
CHIEF (ON PHONE): Look, We've
been talking to Chief Wendell

653
00:40:26,958 --> 00:40:29,961
Over in Doomsday, and they
got it about worse than we do.

654
00:40:30,061 --> 00:40:31,196
Uh-huh.

655
00:40:31,296 --> 00:40:32,564
CHIEF (ON PHONE): Their
emergency room's not filling

656
00:40:32,664 --> 00:40:34,766
Up as quickly as their morgue.

657
00:40:34,866 --> 00:40:36,635
We haven't been able
to get ahold of Wendell

658
00:40:36,735 --> 00:40:40,271
Or anybody else in Doomsday
for the last half hour.

659
00:40:40,371 --> 00:40:42,373
The situation's worse
than we thought.

660
00:40:42,474 --> 00:40:43,975
What do you mean worse?

661
00:40:44,075 --> 00:40:45,511
CHIEF (ON PHONE): I want you two
to wake for backup on this one.

662
00:40:45,611 --> 00:40:47,946
What the hell is going
on? (YELLING) Oh, shit!

663
00:40:52,417 --> 00:40:54,052
Give me your phone.

664
00:40:54,152 --> 00:40:55,020
Give me your phone!

665
00:40:59,324 --> 00:41:03,762
It's um... it's sort of dead.

666

Jesus.

667
00:41:05,697 --> 00:41:06,832
What did the Chief say?

668
00:41:06,932 --> 00:41:09,067
Well, we didn't get that far.

669
00:41:09,167 --> 00:41:12,170
But he did say something about
the shit hitting the fan.

670
00:41:12,270 --> 00:41:13,539
Oh, good.

671
00:41:13,639 --> 00:41:21,547
I'm glad to see the
Chief's on top of sh... OK.

Heads in the freezers...
That I can handle.

But this... this is
some serious shit!

674
00:41:29,054 --> 00:41:30,656
Well, he did say
something about waiting

675
00:41:30,756 --> 00:41:32,023
For backup on this one.

676
00:41:38,329 --> 00:41:39,898
OK.

Let's just... let's just
see where they're going.

678
00:42:00,552 --> 00:42:03,622
I definitely think
we found the source.

679
00:42:03,722 --> 00:42:06,391
What do you think?

680
00:42:06,491 --> 00:42:07,425
I think we need more guns.

How could you think about
sleeping after all this shit?

What is this?

892
00:52:00,251 --> 00:52:01,319
Some kind of joke?

893
00:52:10,561 --> 00:52:14,732
Look, uh... I, uh... I got to go.

894
00:52:14,832 --> 00:52:17,235

Where the bailsbondsmen
tried to grab the shotgun,

[Growl]

926
00:53:49,727 --> 00:53:52,797
The attacks of Doomsday
County have been devastating.

927
00:53:52,897 --> 00:53:55,800
Patricia has been vaporized.

928
00:53:55,900 --> 00:53:57,167
[Crying]

929
00:53:57,268 --> 00:53:58,603
[Interposing voices]
Paul!

930
00:53:58,703 --> 00:53:59,604
Get this!

931
00:53:59,704 --> 00:54:01,005
[Gurgle]

932
00:54:01,105 --> 00:54:02,973
Some sort of
alien-looking creatures

933
00:54:03,073 --> 00:54:05,376
Have seemingly
invaded and gone on

934
00:54:05,476 --> 00:54:07,345
A murderous, malicious rampage!

935
00:54:07,445 --> 00:54:09,146
The whole town's in a frenzy!

936
00:54:09,246 --> 00:54:12,116
We understand that calls have
gone out to military personnel.

937
00:54:12,216 --> 00:54:15,486
The station suggests that
everyone stays indoors and to...

938
00:54:15,586 --> 00:54:16,887
[Zap]

939
00:54:20,925 --> 00:54:22,293
Fucking aliens.

940
00:54:22,393 --> 00:54:23,861
The police can't do anything.

941
00:54:23,961 --> 00:54:27,432
The military is saying they
can't deploy troops for a week.

942
00:54:27,532 --> 00:54:31,802
Doomsday's become a breeding
ground for total chaos.

943
00:54:31,902 --> 00:54:34,104
Sykes, any updates
on the situation?

944
00:54:34,204 --> 00:54:37,308
Mayor Thomas Hayes was just
found murdered in his home.

945
00:54:37,408 --> 00:54:39,344
And reports have been
flooding in from all

946
00:54:39,444 --> 00:54:42,580
Over town of UFO sightings
and attacking creatures.

947
00:54:42,680 --> 00:54:44,081
This has got to stop now.

948
00:54:44,181 --> 00:54:46,517
We've got to take
some goddamn action.

949
00:54:46,617 --> 00:54:47,785
Whew.

950
00:54:47,885 --> 00:54:49,887
Kramer, it's time.

951
00:54:49,987 --> 00:54:51,956
You know what you've got to do.

952
00:54:52,056 --> 00:54:53,891
The commodore was right.

953
00:54:53,991 --> 00:54:56,193
You have no choice.

954
00:54:56,293 --> 00:54:59,196
She's our only hope.

955
00:54:59,296 --> 00:55:00,064
We have to call.

956
00:55:00,164 --> 00:55:02,400
[Cheering]

957
00:55:03,133 --> 00:55:06,637
[Music playing]

958
00:55:32,663 --> 00:55:35,332
[Cheers]

959
00:55:35,433 --> 00:55:37,735
Doomsday County!

960
00:55:37,835 --> 00:55:39,937
This is the best
place I've ever been.

961
00:55:40,037 --> 00:55:40,805
Thank you guys so much.

962
00:55:40,905 --> 00:55:41,639
See you next time.

963
00:56:01,426 --> 00:56:02,259
Hey, handsome.

964
00:56:02,359 --> 00:56:03,928
What can I do you for?

965
00:56:04,028 --> 00:56:04,895
Whew.

966
00:56:04,995 --> 00:56:06,096
We need you right now.

967
00:56:06,196 --> 00:56:07,131
Why?

968
00:56:07,231 --> 00:56:08,399
You want to go bowling?
No.

969
00:56:08,499 --> 00:56:09,800
Seriously.

970
00:56:09,900 --> 00:56:11,802
Well, I just got done
rocking out with the boys.

971
00:56:11,902 --> 00:56:13,738
And now I'm going to
sit my hot ass right

972
00:56:13,838 --> 00:56:15,840
Here at the bar and drink beer.

973
00:56:15,940 --> 00:56:16,707
Ha ha.

974
00:56:16,807 --> 00:56:17,542
How about you?

975
00:56:17,642 --> 00:56:19,844
We need you here immediately.

976
00:56:19,944 --> 00:56:20,878
Yeah, right, man.

977
00:56:20,978 --> 00:56:22,212
That's not going to
happen, because I

978
00:56:22,312 --> 00:56:24,214
Am so tired right now.

979
00:56:24,314 --> 00:56:25,883
And this is the only time that...

980
00:56:25,983 --> 00:56:27,217
Trust me, Betty.

981
00:56:27,317 --> 00:56:28,252
We need you right now.

982
00:56:28,352 --> 00:56:29,620
This is a Code Red situation.

983
00:56:29,720 --> 00:56:31,321
I can't go into
details right now,

984
00:56:31,422 --> 00:56:33,090
But we need you here, pronto.

985
00:56:33,190 --> 00:56:34,425
Fucking A, man.

986
00:56:34,525 --> 00:56:36,060
There better be martians
attacking or something

987
00:56:36,160 --> 00:56:37,294
Or you're going to get it.

988
00:56:37,394 --> 00:56:39,930
Just get over here
as fast as you can!

989
00:56:40,030 --> 00:56:40,798
Yes, sir.

990
00:56:44,502 --> 00:56:46,036
So what'll it be?

991
00:56:46,136 --> 00:56:49,039
Jack and Coke to go.

992
00:56:58,549 --> 00:57:00,017
[Sigh] Let's roll.

993
00:57:16,100 --> 00:57:17,835
What is this?

994
00:57:17,935 --> 00:57:20,237
A small band of renegade
extraterrestrials

995
00:57:20,337 --> 00:57:21,572
Just landed in Doomsday.

996
00:57:21,672 --> 00:57:25,209
And I assure you, they
do not come in peace.

997
00:57:25,309 --> 00:57:27,478
Don't you watch the news?

998
00:57:27,578 --> 00:57:28,813
Oh, sorry sweetie.

999
00:57:28,913 --> 00:57:31,015
I haven't been glued
to the boob tube today.

1000
00:57:31,115 --> 00:57:32,683
I have a real job.

1001
00:57:32,783 --> 00:57:35,986
Thanks to Sykes here we
got some really good stuff.

1002
00:57:36,086 --> 00:57:36,887
[Inaudible].

1003
00:57:36,987 --> 00:57:37,855
You are a genius.

1004
00:57:37,955 --> 00:57:38,723
I try.

1005
00:57:41,125 --> 00:57:43,861
Seriously, though, what's
with all the masks and goggles?

1006
00:57:43,961 --> 00:57:45,996
They have a fear of the
Swine Flu or something?

1007
00:57:46,096 --> 00:57:48,633
These creatures
mean business, Betty.

1008
00:57:48,733 --> 00:57:51,401
And don't let the size of
their lot fool you, either.

1009
00:57:51,502 --> 00:57:52,737
All right?

1010
00:57:52,837 --> 00:57:54,905
Their numbers are small,
but they are ruthless.

1011
00:57:55,005 --> 00:57:58,008
And their technology is
far superior to ours.

1012
00:57:58,108 --> 00:58:00,811
I mean they... they seem
to stop at nothing.

1013
00:58:00,911 --> 00:58:04,381
And they answer to this
tall one named Nepto.

1014
00:58:04,481 --> 00:58:07,985
And he is one mean
son of a bitch.

1015
00:58:08,085 --> 00:58:08,986
Check this out.

1016
00:58:12,089 --> 00:58:12,957
Oh!

1017
00:58:13,057 --> 00:58:13,958
Yeah.

1018
00:58:14,058 --> 00:58:16,160
I think I saw this
on SyFy last week.

1019
00:58:16,260 --> 00:58:19,630
This attack is one of several
attempts by Dr. James Mongoo

1020
00:58:19,730 --> 00:58:22,266
To seize control
over Doomsday County.

1021
00:58:22,366 --> 00:58:23,534
Right.
Yeah.

1022
00:58:23,634 --> 00:58:24,401
Good ole Jimmy.

1023
00:58:24,501 --> 00:58:25,936
At it again, huh?

1024
00:58:26,036 --> 00:58:29,206
Intel shows he's got a new
virus in the works... something

1025
00:58:29,306 --> 00:58:33,377
So terrible it makes cancer
look like chickenpox.

1026
00:58:33,477 --> 00:58:35,079
And with the help
of these aliens,

1027
00:58:35,179 --> 00:58:37,081
He's got interstellar
science at his side...

1028
00:58:37,181 --> 00:58:39,817
Some pseudo-galactic
technology that we

1029
00:58:39,917 --> 00:58:41,552
Don't know two shits about.

1030
00:58:41,652 --> 00:58:44,121
The Pentagon's given
us special permission

1031
00:58:44,221 --> 00:58:46,123
To do whatever it takes.

1032
00:58:46,223 --> 00:58:47,291
We got to stop this now.

1033
00:58:47,391 --> 00:58:49,960
We got to stop this
from happening.

1034
00:58:50,060 --> 00:58:51,696
God help us all.

1035
00:58:51,796 --> 00:58:54,799
How about we all go
pay Dr. Mongoo a visit?

1036
00:58:54,899 --> 00:58:56,400
We don't know the
exact coordinates

1037
00:58:56,500 --> 00:59:00,805
Where the aliens are and where
the virus is being engineered.

1038
00:59:00,905 --> 00:59:03,608
What we do know is that
the area of operations

1039
00:59:03,708 --> 00:59:07,411
Is in the vicinity of Dr.
Mongoo's headquarters.

1040
00:59:07,511 --> 00:59:11,548
You are going to go scope it out
and find where that virus is.

1041
00:59:11,649 --> 00:59:12,950
Yeah.
OK.

1042
00:59:13,050 --> 00:59:13,584
Piece of cake.

1043
00:59:13,684 --> 00:59:15,219
I'll do that.

1044
00:59:15,319 --> 00:59:16,353
Take this.

1045
00:59:16,453 --> 00:59:19,356
This is all we got
of Dr. Mongoo...

1046
00:59:19,456 --> 00:59:22,092
Address, surveillance photos.

1047
00:59:22,192 --> 00:59:24,394
Now do what you do.

1048
00:59:24,494 --> 00:59:26,196
And Betty...

1049
00:59:26,296 --> 00:59:28,198
Yes, cupcake?

1050
00:59:28,298 --> 00:59:31,035
Please be careful.

1051
00:59:31,135 --> 00:59:34,571
Safety doesn't take
a holiday, does it?

1052
00:59:34,672 --> 00:59:37,141
Arsenal stocked?

1053
00:59:37,241 --> 00:59:38,375
Yeah.

1054
00:59:38,475 --> 00:59:40,244
Like fucking Guns R Us, baby.

1055
00:59:49,486 --> 00:59:50,354
What's shaking, bacon?

1056
00:59:54,391 --> 00:59:57,695
I don't know if I want
you to go on this mission.

1057
00:59:57,795 --> 01:00:00,965
Sam, you do this every time.

1058
01:00:03,433 --> 01:00:04,234
What?

1059
01:00:04,334 --> 01:00:06,470
I'm going to be fine.

1060
01:00:06,570 --> 01:00:07,738
There's nothing to worry about.

1061
01:00:07,838 --> 01:00:11,308
It's, you know, just
another little job.

1062
01:00:11,408 --> 01:00:12,743
That's all.

1063
01:00:12,843 --> 01:00:14,078
Just another little job?

1064
01:00:14,178 --> 01:00:15,680
Blood-thirsty
spacemen with a virus,

1065
01:00:15,780 --> 01:00:17,514
Hoping not to take
out the entire world.

1066
01:00:17,614 --> 01:00:18,415
Yeah.

1067
01:00:18,515 --> 01:00:19,449
Nothing to worry about.

1068
01:00:19,549 --> 01:00:20,718
Are you serious?

1069
01:00:20,818 --> 01:00:23,253
Like a heart attack.

1070
01:00:23,353 --> 01:00:25,189
It's always a joke to you.

1071
01:00:25,289 --> 01:00:26,123
Come on.

1072
01:00:26,223 --> 01:00:28,192
Kitten.

1073
01:00:28,292 --> 01:00:29,493
Hey.

1074
01:00:29,593 --> 01:00:34,098
If I don't go after
the bad guys, who will?

1075
01:00:34,198 --> 01:00:36,500
Hm?

1076
01:00:36,600 --> 01:00:40,070
It's just... it's just so much.

1077
01:00:40,170 --> 01:00:41,305
I'm worried.

1078
01:00:41,405 --> 01:00:42,139
Oh.

1079
01:00:42,239 --> 01:00:43,140
I know.

1080
01:00:43,240 --> 01:00:43,774
[Crying]

1081
01:00:43,874 --> 01:00:45,943
It's going to be OK.

1082
01:00:46,043 --> 01:00:50,547
I will never, ever leave you.

1083
01:00:50,647 --> 01:00:54,384
I love you too much.

1084
01:00:54,484 --> 01:00:56,286
I love you too.

1085
01:00:56,386 --> 01:00:57,888
Oh, come here.

1086
01:00:57,988 --> 01:00:59,289
[Crying]

1087
01:01:26,751 --> 01:01:27,852
That was easy.

1088
01:01:52,709 --> 01:01:53,811
Nice one.

1089
01:02:05,355 --> 01:02:07,324
Evening, boys.

1090
01:02:07,424 --> 01:02:11,929
I may be knocking at your door,
but I ain't selling cookies.

1091
01:02:18,435 --> 01:02:19,336
[Laser zaps]

1092
01:02:19,436 --> 01:02:22,472
[Gunshots]

1093
01:02:23,207 --> 01:02:23,908
Shit.

1094
01:02:43,393 --> 01:02:45,295
[Grunt]

1095
01:02:50,167 --> 01:02:52,669
Looks like you're my bait.

1096
01:02:52,769 --> 01:02:54,671
[Growl]

1097
01:02:54,771 --> 01:02:56,273
[Squish]

1098
01:03:04,148 --> 01:03:06,817
Looks like I found the
heart of the problem.

1099
01:03:06,917 --> 01:03:08,018
Wacka.
Wacka.

1100
01:03:08,118 --> 01:03:08,853
Wacka.

1101
01:03:17,761 --> 01:03:21,231
[Sigh]

1102
01:03:25,735 --> 01:03:27,471
Damn good job, Betty.

1103
01:03:27,571 --> 01:03:28,305
Report in the AM.

1104
01:03:32,843 --> 01:03:34,378
She retrieved the virus.

1105
01:03:34,478 --> 01:03:35,712
Well, hard part's over.
