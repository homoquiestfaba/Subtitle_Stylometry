1
00:00:01,100 --> 00:00:03,933
(MultiCom Jingle)

2
00:00:11,367 --> 00:00:14,867
(mysterious exotic music)

3
00:03:02,500 --> 00:03:03,733
- No.

4
00:03:03,733 --> 00:03:04,567
Please.

5
00:03:08,233 --> 00:03:09,067
(gasp)

6
00:03:09,067 --> 00:03:11,067
(thud)

7
00:03:13,367 --> 00:03:16,200
(train chugging)

8
00:03:16,200 --> 00:03:17,067
(whistle blowing)

9
00:03:17,067 --> 00:03:18,700
No, please.

10
00:03:18,700 --> 00:03:19,533
Please!

11
00:03:27,333 --> 00:03:30,433
(panicked breathing)

12
00:03:45,267 --> 00:03:46,467
- Get him!

13
00:03:46,467 --> 00:03:50,133
- Just get him, he'll
 be at the station.

14
00:03:50,133 --> 00:03:50,967
- Please.

15
00:03:55,633 --> 00:03:56,867
- He's getting away.

16
00:03:56,867 --> 00:03:59,300
- Do something, do something!

17
00:04:20,533 --> 00:04:23,367
(whistle blowing)

18
00:04:25,067 --> 00:04:27,367
(screaming)

19
00:04:40,667 --> 00:04:41,600
- It isn't.

20
00:04:43,300 --> 00:04:44,333
It can't be.

21
00:04:44,333 --> 00:04:45,500
- Dalby!

22
00:04:45,500 --> 00:04:47,567
Dalby, do something, please!

23
00:04:47,567 --> 00:04:51,667
The train is nearly at
 the station, do something!

24
00:04:54,167 --> 00:04:56,500
- There is nothing I can do.

25
00:04:57,667 --> 00:04:58,500
I'm sorry.

26
00:04:58,500 --> 00:05:00,767
- But, stop the train!

27
00:05:00,767 --> 00:05:01,600
Stop it!

28
00:05:02,967 --> 00:05:05,633
(bell tolling)

29
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:10,467
(groans)

30
00:05:11,333 --> 00:05:12,833
- Too late for us.

31
00:05:15,667 --> 00:05:17,267
Too late.

32
00:05:17,267 --> 00:05:19,500
(grunting)

33
00:05:26,267 --> 00:05:27,100
- Dalby.

34
00:05:30,767 --> 00:05:33,267
- There is no stopping it now.

35
00:05:33,267 --> 00:05:35,433
(shatter)

36
00:05:50,533 --> 00:05:54,233
(distant conversation)

37
00:05:54,233 --> 00:05:57,400
(soft pleasant music)

38
00:06:47,467 --> 00:06:49,167
Never mind them, Auggie.

39
00:06:49,167 --> 00:06:50,900
They don't understand the magic.

40
00:06:50,900 --> 00:06:52,767
The power of model trains.

41
00:06:52,767 --> 00:06:54,067
- Yeah, I know.

42
00:06:54,067 --> 00:06:56,500
- And besides, today
 is your birthday.

43
00:06:56,500 --> 00:06:59,067
You mustn't let their
 childish games bother you.

44
00:06:59,067 --> 00:06:59,900
Not today!

45
00:07:01,333 --> 00:07:04,067
- Public embarrassment and
complete humiliation bother me?

46
00:07:04,067 --> 00:07:06,067
- Ah come on, come on.

47
00:07:06,067 --> 00:07:07,067
Hey, Auggie.

48
00:07:12,733 --> 00:07:13,800
That's right.

49
00:07:17,633 --> 00:07:19,500
- Ah, I'm tied to the tracks!

50
00:07:19,500 --> 00:07:20,900
Damsel in distress!

51
00:07:20,900 --> 00:07:21,733
Ah, help!

52
00:07:23,333 --> 00:07:24,167
Help!

53
00:07:25,233 --> 00:07:26,067
Help me!

54
00:07:27,067 --> 00:07:28,567
Help me, somebody!

55
00:07:33,300 --> 00:07:34,500
Whoa!

56
00:07:34,500 --> 00:07:36,667
Okay lady, I got
 three words for you,

57
00:07:36,667 --> 00:07:38,067
weight loss set.

58
00:07:39,700 --> 00:07:40,700
- Thank you.

59
00:07:41,967 --> 00:07:44,067
Billy, I told you.

60
00:07:44,067 --> 00:07:45,467
Keep your hands off the train.

61
00:07:45,467 --> 00:07:48,400
- It just went off the
track, August, I swear!

62
00:07:48,400 --> 00:07:49,633
- Hand it over.

63
00:07:52,400 --> 00:07:53,633
Poor thing just couldn't deal,

64
00:07:53,633 --> 00:07:55,667
so she threw herself
 in front of the train?

65
00:07:55,667 --> 00:07:57,167
- She couldn't afford lipo,

66
00:07:57,167 --> 00:07:59,067
and her plastic surgeon
 wouldn't cut her a break.

67
00:07:59,067 --> 00:08:01,067
- Man, you got a
twisted sense of humor.

68
00:08:01,067 --> 00:08:04,267
- Or perhaps an
overactive imagination?

69
00:08:05,167 --> 00:08:07,067
Billy, Billy.

70
00:08:07,067 --> 00:08:09,133
You and your stories.

71
00:08:09,133 --> 00:08:10,067
- What can I say?

72
00:08:10,067 --> 00:08:11,067
It's a gift.

73
00:08:12,467 --> 00:08:15,333
- Everything under
 control, Auggie, hm?

74
00:08:15,333 --> 00:08:17,100
- Yeah, sure, Mr. Dalby.

75
00:08:17,100 --> 00:08:18,500
No problem.

76
00:08:18,500 --> 00:08:19,400
- Good boy.

77
00:08:21,967 --> 00:08:24,467
(keys jingle)

78
00:08:33,167 --> 00:08:34,833
- Hey August.

79
00:08:34,833 --> 00:08:36,367
What do they do back there?

80
00:08:36,367 --> 00:08:38,067
- I don't know,
 inventory, I guess.

81
00:08:38,067 --> 00:08:39,067
- Inventory?

82
00:08:39,067 --> 00:08:40,900
They go in there all the time.

83
00:08:40,900 --> 00:08:42,767
How can there be
 that much inventory?

84
00:08:42,767 --> 00:08:44,100
- I don't know, ask them.

85
00:08:44,100 --> 00:08:45,067
- No way dude!

86
00:08:45,067 --> 00:08:46,267
Those two give me the creeps.

87
00:08:46,267 --> 00:08:47,500
- Ah, give 'em a break.

88
00:08:47,500 --> 00:08:49,933
The Dalbys are totally harmless.

89
00:08:49,933 --> 00:08:51,167
- I don't know.

90
00:08:51,167 --> 00:08:52,433
I think it's weird the
 way they go in there

91
00:08:52,433 --> 00:08:54,067
and lock the door like that.

92
00:08:54,067 --> 00:08:57,367
They've gotta be
up to something.

93
00:08:57,367 --> 00:08:58,667
- All right, but you can't
 squeak a word of this

94
00:08:58,667 --> 00:09:00,233
to anybody, you hear me?

95
00:09:00,233 --> 00:09:02,667
- Yeah, yeah, I swear.

96
00:09:02,667 --> 00:09:04,600
- All right, they're in
 there counting the hands.

97
00:09:04,600 --> 00:09:05,667
- The what?

98
00:09:05,667 --> 00:09:06,967
- The hands.

99
00:09:06,967 --> 00:09:08,667
Jars and jars of 'em.

100
00:09:08,667 --> 00:09:10,233
Shelves full of 'em.

101
00:09:10,233 --> 00:09:11,567
- What hands?

102
00:09:11,567 --> 00:09:13,200
- The pickled hands
 of all the rugrats

103
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:15,467
who messed with the trains.

104
00:09:18,167 --> 00:09:19,100
Psych!

105
00:09:19,100 --> 00:09:21,333
- Oh, you're not even funny.

106
00:09:22,333 --> 00:09:23,600
- Yeah, I had him going.

107
00:09:23,600 --> 00:09:24,867
But he deserved it!

108
00:09:24,867 --> 00:09:26,633
He's gonna end up
 getting me fired.

109
00:09:26,633 --> 00:09:28,067
That or break
 something that's gonna

110
00:09:28,067 --> 00:09:30,933
take me six months of
 working weekends to pay for.

111
00:09:30,933 --> 00:09:34,333
I guess when I was
 his age I was...

112
00:09:34,333 --> 00:09:35,967
Actually, nothing like him.

113
00:09:35,967 --> 00:09:39,267
Except for the fact that we
 both hung out in train stores.

114
00:09:39,267 --> 00:09:40,433
See, but I had the bug.

115
00:09:40,433 --> 00:09:42,067
That's when I
 started collecting.

116
00:09:42,067 --> 00:09:43,733
Why do you think
 I'm working here?

117
00:09:43,733 --> 00:09:45,767
Can you say employee discount?

118
00:09:45,767 --> 00:09:47,833
I almost couldn't believe
 it when Mr. Dalby,

119
00:09:47,833 --> 00:09:50,933
you know, my boss, hired me.

120
00:09:50,933 --> 00:09:54,067
He can be pretty
 intimidating sometimes, but,

121
00:09:54,067 --> 00:09:55,267
he's cool.

122
00:09:55,267 --> 00:09:56,800
Lately him and Mrs.
 Dalby have been making

123
00:09:56,800 --> 00:09:58,867
a big deal about my birthday.

124
00:09:58,867 --> 00:10:00,700
It's kinda like
 I'm their grandson.

125
00:10:00,700 --> 00:10:02,867
Billy's totally
 weirded out by them.

126
00:10:02,867 --> 00:10:04,900
Especially Mr. Dalby
 with that beard

127
00:10:04,900 --> 00:10:06,867
and accent and everything.

128
00:10:06,867 --> 00:10:08,100
I think Billy's got some serious

129
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:10,233
Santa Claus issues
 he's gotta work out.

130
00:10:10,233 --> 00:10:11,467
(laughs)

131
00:10:11,467 --> 00:10:14,533
I don't mind him hanging around.

132
00:10:14,533 --> 00:10:16,433
In fact, I kinda like it.

133
00:10:16,433 --> 00:10:19,533
There's something about
 Billy I haven't told you yet.

134
00:10:19,533 --> 00:10:21,433
Remember that blonde?

135
00:10:21,433 --> 00:10:25,133
That total hottie walking
 down the sidewalk?

136
00:10:25,133 --> 00:10:28,033
You know, the one
 with the goon squad?

137
00:10:28,033 --> 00:10:30,000
That's Billy's sister.

138
00:10:30,000 --> 00:10:32,233
Hard to believe, I know.

139
00:10:32,233 --> 00:10:35,800
It's not like I have
 a chance with her.

140
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:39,167
She probably sees me as her
 little brother's friend.

141
00:10:39,167 --> 00:10:41,933
But, you can always
 dream, right?

142
00:10:48,467 --> 00:10:50,467
So what's your
 sister doing tonight?

143
00:10:50,467 --> 00:10:51,800
She going to the movies?

144
00:10:51,800 --> 00:10:52,633
- I don't know.

145
00:10:52,633 --> 00:10:53,700
Why don't you ask her?

146
00:10:53,700 --> 00:10:56,100
- Oh, it's no big deal.

147
00:10:56,100 --> 00:10:58,467
- Look, I know Ellen
 rocks your world and all,

148
00:10:58,467 --> 00:11:00,667
but I'm telling you,
 she's just such a,

149
00:11:00,667 --> 00:11:02,067
such a...

150
00:11:02,067 --> 00:11:03,500
- A what?

151
00:11:03,500 --> 00:11:05,933
- A bathroom-hogging,
 remote-control-monopolizing

152
00:11:05,933 --> 00:11:08,333
cordless phone queen!

153
00:11:08,333 --> 00:11:10,500
Look, here comes
 her lameness now!

154
00:11:10,500 --> 00:11:12,800
- Hey you keep your mouth
 shut, Billy, not a word.

155
00:11:12,800 --> 00:11:13,967
- You're the man.

156
00:11:13,967 --> 00:11:15,233
- What's up Billy?

157
00:11:15,233 --> 00:11:16,700
You were supposed to
 be home an hour ago.

158
00:11:16,700 --> 00:11:17,567
Hi August.

159
00:11:17,567 --> 00:11:19,067
- Uh, hi!

160
00:11:19,067 --> 00:11:21,533
- So this is how you guys
spend your Saturday afternoons?

161
00:11:21,533 --> 00:11:23,200
- Well, we were thinking
about going to the mall,

162
00:11:23,200 --> 00:11:25,967
you know, suck down a
 few mocha smoothies.

163
00:11:25,967 --> 00:11:27,400
Shop for some lip gloss.

164
00:11:27,400 --> 00:11:29,267
Oh, and check out
 the dude potential.

165
00:11:29,267 --> 00:11:30,700
- Shut up, Billy.

166
00:11:30,700 --> 00:11:33,067
(slow instrumental music)

167
00:11:33,067 --> 00:11:34,767
This is kind of cute.

168
00:11:36,333 --> 00:11:38,933
It's neat how everything's
 all little and stuff.

169
00:11:38,933 --> 00:11:41,533
- [August] It's the HO scale.
 - [Ellen] The what?

170
00:11:41,533 --> 00:11:44,167
- It's train speak
 for little and stuff.

171
00:11:44,167 --> 00:11:47,433
- Do you guys rehearse this
 or are you just improvising?

172
00:11:47,433 --> 00:11:48,500
- Okay, sorry.

173
00:11:48,500 --> 00:11:50,067
It's the HO scale.

174
00:11:51,167 --> 00:11:53,233
Scale refers to the
size of the model train.

175
00:11:53,233 --> 00:11:55,467
It's the proportion
 that the model bears

176
00:11:55,467 --> 00:11:57,833
to the actual prototype.

177
00:11:57,833 --> 00:11:59,633
The train it's modeled after.

178
00:11:59,633 --> 00:12:01,400
And then there's the
 gauge too, which,

179
00:12:01,400 --> 00:12:03,233
a lot of times people
confuse with the scale,

180
00:12:03,233 --> 00:12:06,233
but the gauge is actually
 just the track size.

181
00:12:06,233 --> 00:12:08,733
It's the distance between
 the inside of one rail

182
00:12:08,733 --> 00:12:10,967
to the inside of the other rail.

183
00:12:10,967 --> 00:12:12,167
Well.

184
00:12:12,167 --> 00:12:13,567
I guess you should
 get the point.

185
00:12:13,567 --> 00:12:15,667
- You really know a lot
about this, don't you?

186
00:12:15,667 --> 00:12:16,867
- Yeah.

187
00:12:16,867 --> 00:12:18,233
I was never into that
 whole muscle head

188
00:12:18,233 --> 00:12:20,067
He-Man type of thing.

189
00:12:21,100 --> 00:12:22,333
- What's that?

190
00:12:22,333 --> 00:12:23,967
- Oh, it's just fake.

191
00:12:23,967 --> 00:12:28,333
I mean, the track is real, but
 the wall is just a backdrop.

192
00:12:28,333 --> 00:12:29,667
It's a dead end.

193
00:12:31,467 --> 00:12:33,567
- Well, come on Billy, let's go.

194
00:12:33,567 --> 00:12:36,833
- Okay, but I think August
 wanted to ask you something.

195
00:12:36,833 --> 00:12:37,767
- What?

196
00:12:37,767 --> 00:12:39,067
- He wanted to know if you would

197
00:12:39,067 --> 00:12:40,233
go with him to the
 movies tonight.

198
00:12:40,233 --> 00:12:42,500
It's his birthday and
he doesn't have a date.

199
00:12:42,500 --> 00:12:44,300
- It's your birthday?

200
00:12:44,300 --> 00:12:46,133
- Yeah, I guess.

201
00:12:46,133 --> 00:12:47,867
I mean, yeah, I'm 15.

202
00:12:48,733 --> 00:12:50,267
- What movie?

203
00:12:50,267 --> 00:12:51,833
- Uh, I don't know.

204
00:12:53,433 --> 00:12:55,533
Shakespeare in Rome's
 playing at The Plaza.

205
00:12:55,533 --> 00:12:57,533
- Ugh, total chick flick.

206
00:12:57,533 --> 00:13:00,700
What about Retro Puppet Master?

207
00:13:00,700 --> 00:13:01,600
- Oh, okay.

208
00:13:02,467 --> 00:13:04,533
That's playing at The Grand.

209
00:13:04,533 --> 00:13:07,067
- It starts at seven,
so come by around 6:30.

210
00:13:07,067 --> 00:13:08,800
- See, was that so hard?

211
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:10,333
- [Ellen and August]
 Shut up, Billy.

212
00:13:10,333 --> 00:13:11,167
- Come on.

213
00:13:15,967 --> 00:13:18,700
(train rattling)

214
00:13:22,433 --> 00:13:23,267
- Yes!

215
00:13:46,067 --> 00:13:47,233
(rattling)

216
00:13:47,233 --> 00:13:49,233
(click)

217
00:13:56,067 --> 00:13:57,633
Oh hey,

218
00:13:57,633 --> 00:13:59,533
I was just locking up.

219
00:13:59,533 --> 00:14:01,700
- You can't leave without
 your birthday surprise,

220
00:14:01,700 --> 00:14:03,100
now can you?

221
00:14:03,100 --> 00:14:04,433
- Uh.

222
00:14:04,433 --> 00:14:06,433
I guess I got some time.

223
00:14:10,167 --> 00:14:11,333
What's in it?

224
00:14:11,333 --> 00:14:12,600
- Open and see.

225
00:14:16,367 --> 00:14:19,700
(mysterious music)

226
00:14:19,700 --> 00:14:20,633
- Cool.

227
00:14:20,633 --> 00:14:22,233
It's, uh it's a key, right?

228
00:14:22,233 --> 00:14:23,600
- Indeed it is, my boy.

229
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,833
Indeed it is.

230
00:14:24,833 --> 00:14:27,067
A very special key.

231
00:14:27,067 --> 00:14:29,100
- What's it, I mean...

232
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:30,400
- What does it open?

233
00:14:30,400 --> 00:14:31,333
- Yeah.

234
00:14:31,333 --> 00:14:32,600
- Come and see.

235
00:14:36,067 --> 00:14:37,900
That shed there,

236
00:14:37,900 --> 00:14:39,067
slide it back.

237
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:44,200
Easy, easy.

238
00:14:45,800 --> 00:14:47,467
There is your answer.

239
00:14:47,467 --> 00:14:48,833
- What's it for?

240
00:14:48,833 --> 00:14:50,233
- Try it and see.

241
00:14:54,200 --> 00:14:56,767
(key clicking)

242
00:15:00,700 --> 00:15:01,500
- Whoa!

243
00:15:03,067 --> 00:15:04,467
Where do they go?

244
00:15:05,633 --> 00:15:08,300
- That, my boy, is
 a real surprise.

245
00:15:17,300 --> 00:15:19,567
(keys jingle)

246
00:15:19,567 --> 00:15:21,200
(click)

247
00:15:21,200 --> 00:15:22,700
- [August] Mr. Dalby...

248
00:15:22,700 --> 00:15:24,200
- Nothing to fear.

249
00:15:25,900 --> 00:15:27,900
(click)

250
00:15:32,500 --> 00:15:34,400
- Wow, it's incredible.

251
00:15:35,400 --> 00:15:37,767
- Indeed it is, my boy.

252
00:15:37,767 --> 00:15:39,667
It is my night village.

253
00:15:40,800 --> 00:15:44,767
A world I have chosen
 to share with you.

254
00:15:44,767 --> 00:15:47,600
Let me show you the
train that goes with it.

255
00:15:47,600 --> 00:15:48,600
- The train?

256
00:15:49,967 --> 00:15:51,867
- A very special train.

257
00:15:53,233 --> 00:15:55,267
A train that is
 equal in splendor to

258
00:15:55,267 --> 00:15:58,167
the world through
 which it travels.

259
00:15:58,167 --> 00:16:01,500
(mysterious exotic music)

260
00:16:01,500 --> 00:16:02,500
Baggage car.

261
00:16:03,367 --> 00:16:04,767
Coach.

262
00:16:04,767 --> 00:16:06,600
Another coach.

263
00:16:06,600 --> 00:16:08,900
And here is the locomotive

264
00:16:08,900 --> 00:16:09,800
and tender.

265
00:16:13,767 --> 00:16:16,200
- But it's so strange.

266
00:16:16,200 --> 00:16:18,100
I've never seen it in
 any of the catalogs.

267
00:16:18,100 --> 00:16:19,867
- It's one of a kind.

268
00:16:22,300 --> 00:16:23,767
- [August] Landros.

269
00:16:23,767 --> 00:16:27,100
- Pavel Landros, a
 remarkable craftsman.

270
00:16:28,200 --> 00:16:31,100
This set represents
 his life work.

271
00:16:31,100 --> 00:16:34,200
And all of him that
 survives is here.

272
00:16:36,633 --> 00:16:40,800
But, what is a train without
 passengers and crew, eh?

273
00:16:47,333 --> 00:16:48,633
- Cool.

274
00:16:48,633 --> 00:16:50,300
Did Landros do the figures too?

275
00:16:50,300 --> 00:16:51,133
- He did.

276
00:16:53,533 --> 00:16:55,700
- [August] There's
 three missing.

277
00:16:55,700 --> 00:16:57,067
- Yes.

278
00:16:57,067 --> 00:16:58,233
Those three are lost.

279
00:16:58,233 --> 00:17:00,533
One permanently, I'm afraid.

280
00:17:00,533 --> 00:17:01,933
- What about the other two?

281
00:17:01,933 --> 00:17:03,300
- Those two?

282
00:17:03,300 --> 00:17:04,633
Well,

283
00:17:04,633 --> 00:17:07,800
they are safe for now
 and some day soon,

284
00:17:07,800 --> 00:17:09,267
if all goes well,

285
00:17:09,267 --> 00:17:13,400
they'll be reunited
 with the six free men.

286
00:17:13,400 --> 00:17:14,767
But come.

287
00:17:14,767 --> 00:17:16,367
We must place them.

288
00:17:24,500 --> 00:17:25,733
Our businessman

289
00:17:27,333 --> 00:17:28,167
goes

290
00:17:29,067 --> 00:17:31,067
here, travelling alone.

291
00:17:32,833 --> 00:17:34,233
The young mother,

292
00:17:35,133 --> 00:17:35,967
here.

293
00:17:36,900 --> 00:17:38,733
Next, the little girl.

294
00:17:39,733 --> 00:17:42,100
She's a handful, this one, so,

295
00:17:42,100 --> 00:17:45,100
we must seat her
 next to her mother.

296
00:17:55,867 --> 00:17:58,867
The engineer, of
 course, in his cab.

297
00:18:00,567 --> 00:18:02,400
And the conductor,

298
00:18:02,400 --> 00:18:04,400
here in the baggage car.

299
00:18:06,067 --> 00:18:08,667
And that leaves only one.

300
00:18:08,667 --> 00:18:09,500
Take him.

301
00:18:10,333 --> 00:18:12,100
- Where does he go?

302
00:18:12,100 --> 00:18:14,600
- The boy goes in the station.

303
00:18:16,067 --> 00:18:19,467
Today is a special day for
 him, like it is for you.

304
00:18:19,467 --> 00:18:21,967
His journey is about to begin.

305
00:18:23,733 --> 00:18:25,067
And now you must make it run.

306
00:18:25,067 --> 00:18:26,167
It is time.

307
00:18:26,167 --> 00:18:28,600
- What's that clock thing?

308
00:18:28,600 --> 00:18:29,500
- Oh.
 (watch beeps)

309
00:18:29,500 --> 00:18:30,800
- Oh no.

310
00:18:30,800 --> 00:18:31,867
I gotta go.

311
00:18:31,867 --> 00:18:34,300
I was supposed to meet Ellen.

312
00:18:36,367 --> 00:18:39,233
I'm sorry Mr. Dalby, it's...

313
00:18:39,233 --> 00:18:42,133
I mean, it's the
 coolest layout, but...

314
00:18:42,133 --> 00:18:44,900
- No no, no need
 to explain, my boy.

315
00:18:44,900 --> 00:18:46,867
Go on and have your fun tonight.

316
00:18:46,867 --> 00:18:50,633
The key is yours now, and the
 night village will be waiting.

317
00:18:50,633 --> 00:18:52,200
- Thanks Mr. Dalby.

318
00:18:53,833 --> 00:18:56,267
(door shuts)

319
00:18:58,867 --> 00:19:01,333
(keys jingle)

320
00:19:01,333 --> 00:19:03,333
(click)

321
00:19:10,467 --> 00:19:12,200
- He has the key now.

322
00:19:12,200 --> 00:19:14,367
He'll be back, you'll see.

323
00:19:24,133 --> 00:19:26,067
Goodnight, Mrs. Dalby.

324
00:19:26,067 --> 00:19:28,067
- Goodnight, Mr. Dalby.

325
00:19:31,133 --> 00:19:34,067
(mysterious music)

326
00:19:35,533 --> 00:19:38,367
- You know, you really
 surprised me tonight.

327
00:19:38,367 --> 00:19:39,900
- Oh.

328
00:19:39,900 --> 00:19:42,200
I always eat two chili-cheese
 dogs when I go to the movies.

329
00:19:42,200 --> 00:19:43,900
- No, not that.

330
00:19:43,900 --> 00:19:46,133
It's just that Billy says
 that you're like the man

331
00:19:46,133 --> 00:19:47,767
when it comes to the
 whole toy train thing,

332
00:19:47,767 --> 00:19:49,933
and you haven't
 even mentioned them.

333
00:19:49,933 --> 00:19:52,133
- It's model trains.

334
00:19:52,133 --> 00:19:54,200
But it's not really a kid thing.

335
00:19:54,200 --> 00:19:57,600
I mean, it's more of a passion.

336
00:19:57,600 --> 00:19:59,533
I mean, you like movies, right?

337
00:19:59,533 --> 00:20:00,767
- Yeah, majorly.

338
00:20:00,767 --> 00:20:02,367
- So when you go
 to the movies and

339
00:20:02,367 --> 00:20:03,767
the lights go down,

340
00:20:03,767 --> 00:20:06,100
and you slip into another world.

341
00:20:06,100 --> 00:20:09,833
I mean, everything just
 disappears for two hours.

342
00:20:09,833 --> 00:20:11,167
School, parents.

343
00:20:12,267 --> 00:20:13,900
Annoying little brother.

344
00:20:13,900 --> 00:20:15,833
None of them exist.

345
00:20:15,833 --> 00:20:18,633
- Actually, Retro Puppet
 Master didn't do it for me,

346
00:20:18,633 --> 00:20:20,333
but I know what you mean.

347
00:20:20,333 --> 00:20:22,700
And that's what model
 trains do for you?

348
00:20:22,700 --> 00:20:23,733
- Yeah.

349
00:20:23,733 --> 00:20:26,133
Except I leave the lights on.

350
00:20:28,433 --> 00:20:29,867
Do you wanna see?

351
00:20:31,167 --> 00:20:32,367
- Now?

352
00:20:32,367 --> 00:20:33,200
- Why not?

353
00:20:34,700 --> 00:20:36,033
- Okay, why not?

354
00:20:40,533 --> 00:20:42,333
I know, I know.

355
00:20:42,333 --> 00:20:44,367
What was I thinking, right?

356
00:20:44,367 --> 00:20:46,667
Like how many times have
we heard that old line?

357
00:20:46,667 --> 00:20:48,133
Do you wanna go see?

358
00:20:48,133 --> 00:20:49,067
Please.

359
00:20:49,067 --> 00:20:49,900
He's cute.

360
00:20:51,400 --> 00:20:54,167
And I bet you a tub of that
 jumbo popcorn he's harmless.

361
00:20:54,167 --> 00:20:55,733
He's probably more into
those choo-choo trains

362
00:20:55,733 --> 00:20:57,167
than girls anyway.

363
00:20:57,167 --> 00:20:59,000
And he did say the
 lights would be on.

364
00:20:59,000 --> 00:21:00,867
Plus, he's barely 15,

365
00:21:00,867 --> 00:21:03,800
and I've been 16 like
for four months already.

366
00:21:03,800 --> 00:21:05,867
I even dated a guy that was 17.

367
00:21:05,867 --> 00:21:08,233
I mean, it was only like
 for three weeks or whatever,

368
00:21:08,233 --> 00:21:09,800
but still.

369
00:21:09,800 --> 00:21:12,833
I just think it was cool that
 August knew I liked movies

370
00:21:12,833 --> 00:21:15,067
and the way they make me feel.

371
00:21:15,067 --> 00:21:16,667
I mean, that's not like
something I've ever

372
00:21:16,667 --> 00:21:18,800
even talked to a
 guy about before.

373
00:21:18,800 --> 00:21:21,067
I mean, that 17-year-old
guy, he was a jock

374
00:21:21,067 --> 00:21:24,600
and a total stud but he was
 always grunting and flexing.

375
00:21:24,600 --> 00:21:27,067
You take him out of the gym
 or off the football field,

376
00:21:27,067 --> 00:21:29,167
and he's just clueless.

377
00:21:29,167 --> 00:21:31,300
And August is...

378
00:21:31,300 --> 00:21:32,500
Different.

379
00:21:32,500 --> 00:21:36,067
In that doe-eyed
 sensitive kind of way.

380
00:21:36,067 --> 00:21:37,400
Ugh, but he is Billy's friend,

381
00:21:37,400 --> 00:21:39,900
and Billy is a total
 infant, if you ask me.

382
00:21:39,900 --> 00:21:42,600
You probably think I'm
 robbing the cradle, right?

383
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:44,200
But it's not like
 they're best friends.

384
00:21:44,200 --> 00:21:45,433
I mean, Billy's
 not gonna have him

385
00:21:45,433 --> 00:21:47,533
spend the night at
 our house or anything.

386
00:21:47,533 --> 00:21:48,367
Please!

387
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,100
- It's okay.

388
00:21:57,100 --> 00:21:59,600
(keys jingle)

389
00:22:00,767 --> 00:22:02,767
(click)

390
00:22:06,067 --> 00:22:07,100
Follow me.

391
00:22:07,100 --> 00:22:08,433
- Where are we going?

392
00:22:08,433 --> 00:22:09,633
- The back room.

393
00:22:09,633 --> 00:22:11,367
- The back room?

394
00:22:11,367 --> 00:22:12,600
You're not gonna
 show me my brother's

395
00:22:12,600 --> 00:22:14,467
hand in a jar, are you?

396
00:22:14,467 --> 00:22:15,900
- Trust me.

397
00:22:15,900 --> 00:22:17,167
- [Ellen] Okay.

398
00:22:27,767 --> 00:22:29,400
I can't see anything.

399
00:22:29,400 --> 00:22:30,400
- [August] Yeah,
 it'll take me a second

400
00:22:30,400 --> 00:22:32,633
to find the light, hold on.

401
00:22:34,600 --> 00:22:37,067
- [Ellen] Is this how you
 train guys pick up girls?

402
00:22:37,067 --> 00:22:39,300
- [August] Something like that.

403
00:22:39,300 --> 00:22:41,133
(click)

404
00:22:41,133 --> 00:22:43,133
- Check it out.

405
00:22:43,133 --> 00:22:44,400
It's beautiful!

406
00:22:46,267 --> 00:22:49,933
- See, this is someone's
dream of a better world,

407
00:22:49,933 --> 00:22:53,267
where everything and
 everyone is good, you know?

408
00:22:53,267 --> 00:22:56,300
And right, it's perfect here.

409
00:22:56,300 --> 00:22:58,633
The way you could only dream it.

410
00:22:58,633 --> 00:23:00,133
Sometimes,

411
00:23:00,133 --> 00:23:03,167
sometimes I just
 wish the world away.

412
00:23:04,700 --> 00:23:08,733
Forget about all the
 cliches and the jerks and

413
00:23:08,733 --> 00:23:11,367
things that are
supposed to be cool and

414
00:23:11,367 --> 00:23:12,200
uncool.

415
00:23:14,633 --> 00:23:16,667
Forget about the speech.

416
00:23:16,667 --> 00:23:19,267
You wanna run the train?

417
00:23:19,267 --> 00:23:20,433
- Let me help.

418
00:23:23,800 --> 00:23:26,100
(click)

419
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,867
(train chugging)

420
00:23:32,233 --> 00:23:35,067
(whistle blowing)

421
00:23:41,300 --> 00:23:44,567
So, tell me about the girls
 in your perfect world.

422
00:23:44,567 --> 00:23:45,567
- The girls?

423
00:23:47,467 --> 00:23:50,633
I don't know, never
 been there before.

424
00:23:53,867 --> 00:23:58,067
(wind blowing)
 (electricity zapping)

425
00:24:08,533 --> 00:24:11,100
(bell tolling)

426
00:24:20,567 --> 00:24:23,367
(train chugging)

427
00:24:23,367 --> 00:24:24,633
- Is it them?

428
00:24:24,633 --> 00:24:28,100
- [Mr. Dalby and Mrs.
 Dalby] The back room!

429
00:24:41,300 --> 00:24:42,133
- Joseph!

430
00:24:45,667 --> 00:24:48,133
It is just as I said.

431
00:24:48,133 --> 00:24:50,167
Young August could not resist.

432
00:24:50,167 --> 00:24:52,067
He could not stay away.

433
00:24:52,067 --> 00:24:53,367
(labored breathing)

434
00:24:53,367 --> 00:24:55,100
Yes Joseph,

435
00:24:55,100 --> 00:24:58,967
it is difficult at first,
 until you learn to breathe.

436
00:24:58,967 --> 00:25:02,067
And you are going to
breathe in so much more.

437
00:25:02,067 --> 00:25:05,967
Young boy, there is so
 much more to give you.

438
00:25:05,967 --> 00:25:07,600
There.

439
00:25:07,600 --> 00:25:08,933
You see, Joseph?

440
00:25:10,333 --> 00:25:11,433
It has begun.

441
00:25:12,533 --> 00:25:14,567
Forget your troubles.

442
00:25:14,567 --> 00:25:16,733
The transformation begins.

443
00:25:19,667 --> 00:25:22,233
(bell tolling)

444
00:25:38,567 --> 00:25:39,400
- Tickets.

445
00:25:40,300 --> 00:25:41,533
Tickets please.

446
00:25:42,700 --> 00:25:44,700
Tickets, tickets please.

447
00:25:50,900 --> 00:25:52,067
Ticket please.

448
00:25:53,067 --> 00:25:54,067
- I don't...

449
00:25:57,667 --> 00:26:00,800
- [Conductor] Ticket please!

450
00:26:00,800 --> 00:26:04,167
- I'm sorry, I don't know
 what's going on, but,

451
00:26:04,167 --> 00:26:05,800
I have no ticket.

452
00:26:05,800 --> 00:26:06,800
- No ticket.

453
00:26:07,867 --> 00:26:08,700
No stops.

454
00:26:11,133 --> 00:26:13,133
Tickets, tickets please.

455
00:26:15,633 --> 00:26:16,467
Tickets.

456
00:26:17,700 --> 00:26:18,967
Tickets please.

457
00:26:20,167 --> 00:26:21,067
Tickets.

458
00:26:21,067 --> 00:26:23,500
(whistle blowing)

459
00:26:23,500 --> 00:26:25,067
- Excuse me, lady?

460
00:26:26,067 --> 00:26:28,200
Hey lady, can you hear me?

461
00:26:29,067 --> 00:26:30,067
I guess not.

462
00:26:31,467 --> 00:26:35,333
I guess I'll only eat one
 chili-cheese dog from now on.

463
00:26:35,333 --> 00:26:36,567
Wait a minute.

464
00:26:36,567 --> 00:26:38,067
- [Mr. Dalby] But,
 what is a train

465
00:26:38,067 --> 00:26:40,833
without passengers and crew?

466
00:26:40,833 --> 00:26:42,567
Our business man goes

467
00:26:43,467 --> 00:26:44,767
here.

468
00:26:44,767 --> 00:26:46,633
Travelling alone.

469
00:26:46,633 --> 00:26:48,067
The young mother.

470
00:26:50,600 --> 00:26:52,633
- No, it can't be.

471
00:26:52,633 --> 00:26:54,233
Wait, there's no little girl.

472
00:26:54,233 --> 00:26:58,400
There's supposed to be a
little girl next to her mother.

473
00:26:59,500 --> 00:27:01,467
There is no way.

474
00:27:01,467 --> 00:27:05,633
(bell tolling)
 (groans)

475
00:27:12,700 --> 00:27:14,800
- [Voiceover] Are
 you a stowaway then?

476
00:27:14,800 --> 00:27:15,600
- What?

477
00:27:19,600 --> 00:27:23,200
- Well you're on the train
 without a ticket, aren't you?

478
00:27:23,200 --> 00:27:24,067
- You.

479
00:27:26,167 --> 00:27:27,833
Everything seems so real.

480
00:27:27,833 --> 00:27:29,600
- Yeah, it's real all right.

481
00:27:29,600 --> 00:27:30,800
- Right.

482
00:27:30,800 --> 00:27:33,433
I'm on a model train
with plastic passengers.

483
00:27:33,433 --> 00:27:35,867
Man, I hope I remember
 this when I wake up.

484
00:27:35,867 --> 00:27:36,700
(thud)

485
00:27:36,700 --> 00:27:38,333
Ow!

486
00:27:38,333 --> 00:27:40,367
- Are you awake now, Auggie?

487
00:27:40,367 --> 00:27:41,200
Are you?

488
00:27:42,267 --> 00:27:43,767
- Auggie?

489
00:27:43,767 --> 00:27:44,667
How do you know my--

490
00:27:44,667 --> 00:27:46,167
- [Ellen] August?

491
00:27:46,167 --> 00:27:47,067
- Ellen?

492
00:27:47,933 --> 00:27:49,667
Ellen, where are you?

493
00:27:51,367 --> 00:27:54,133
(whistle blowing)

494
00:28:05,500 --> 00:28:07,100
- Hi.

495
00:28:07,100 --> 00:28:08,067
- You okay?

496
00:28:09,133 --> 00:28:11,600
- Yeah, yeah, I'm okay.

497
00:28:11,600 --> 00:28:13,833
But where are we?

498
00:28:13,833 --> 00:28:15,267
- Are you awake?

499
00:28:15,267 --> 00:28:17,267
Do you feel like you're awake?

500
00:28:17,267 --> 00:28:18,967
- Of course I'm awake.

501
00:28:18,967 --> 00:28:21,067
- I was afraid you
 were gonna say that.

502
00:28:21,067 --> 00:28:24,300
- Well, I don't know
 what to make of it.

503
00:28:24,300 --> 00:28:27,067
What will we do with
 the two of them?

504
00:28:27,067 --> 00:28:28,800
- It's against code.

505
00:28:28,800 --> 00:28:30,567
There are procedures
 that must be followed,

506
00:28:30,567 --> 00:28:31,700
standards to keep.

507
00:28:31,700 --> 00:28:33,067
It's bad for business, I say.

508
00:28:33,067 --> 00:28:34,867
Bad for business.

509
00:28:34,867 --> 00:28:36,200
- Ellen.

510
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:38,900
It sounds like a
 girl's name to me.

511
00:28:38,900 --> 00:28:40,733
Yeah, yeah, I'm positive.

512
00:28:40,733 --> 00:28:43,533
It is a girl's name,
 I bet my life on it.

513
00:28:43,533 --> 00:28:45,533
- Just what do you
 think you're up to?

514
00:28:45,533 --> 00:28:47,400
- I'll never tell.

515
00:28:47,400 --> 00:28:48,900
- We're on the train.

516
00:28:48,900 --> 00:28:52,367
I don't know how, but, I
 think we're on the train.

517
00:28:52,367 --> 00:28:53,600
(scoffs)

518
00:28:53,600 --> 00:28:55,433
- Did you figure that
 out all by yourself?

519
00:28:55,433 --> 00:28:56,833
- You don't get it.

520
00:28:56,833 --> 00:28:59,400
I mean, I don't
 get it either, but,

521
00:28:59,400 --> 00:29:01,800
I think we're on the train.

522
00:29:01,800 --> 00:29:04,367
The train in the back
 room of the store.

523
00:29:04,367 --> 00:29:06,667
- The, the toy train?

524
00:29:06,667 --> 00:29:08,233
- Model train.

525
00:29:08,233 --> 00:29:09,833
But yeah, I think so.

526
00:29:09,833 --> 00:29:11,333
- August, reality?

527
00:29:15,500 --> 00:29:18,133
(whistle blowing)

528
00:29:18,133 --> 00:29:19,900
(whispering)

529
00:29:19,900 --> 00:29:22,333
Wait, who are those
 people down there?

530
00:29:22,333 --> 00:29:24,100
- They're the figures.

531
00:29:24,100 --> 00:29:25,067
The passengers.

532
00:29:25,067 --> 00:29:25,833
- The who?

533
00:29:25,833 --> 00:29:27,267
- All right, the toys.

534
00:29:27,267 --> 00:29:30,967
They're the toy people
 who ride the train.

535
00:29:30,967 --> 00:29:34,200
- But August, they're
 as big as we are.

536
00:29:35,667 --> 00:29:39,100
- Or, I think we're
 as small as they are.

537
00:29:41,300 --> 00:29:43,233
- I take it back.

538
00:29:43,233 --> 00:29:45,933
I don't think I'm
 awake after all.

539
00:29:45,933 --> 00:29:47,733
- Look, look, look everyone!

540
00:29:47,733 --> 00:29:49,067
It's Joseph!

541
00:29:49,067 --> 00:29:50,067
He's made it.

542
00:29:50,067 --> 00:29:52,167
The ritual is working.

543
00:29:52,167 --> 00:29:53,400
- Now it's up to us.

544
00:29:53,400 --> 00:29:55,833
We cannot let anything
 go wrong this time.

545
00:29:55,833 --> 00:29:58,200
- Well I think something
has gone wrong.

546
00:29:58,200 --> 00:30:00,200
There's either one
 too many of them,

547
00:30:00,200 --> 00:30:01,433
or one too many of us.

548
00:30:01,433 --> 00:30:02,667
- Oh no you don't.

549
00:30:02,667 --> 00:30:04,700
- Well she is a girl.

550
00:30:04,700 --> 00:30:06,133
And I'm a girl...

551
00:30:06,133 --> 00:30:08,067
- I say leave the
 girl out of it.

552
00:30:08,067 --> 00:30:10,467
It's the boy who's important.

553
00:30:12,333 --> 00:30:14,467
We cannot let him
 out of our sight.

554
00:30:14,467 --> 00:30:17,600
- Besides darling, if the
 girl were part of the ritual,

555
00:30:17,600 --> 00:30:20,200
I would take her
 place at the station.

556
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:21,333
- You?

557
00:30:21,333 --> 00:30:23,000
Look, the girl's here for me!

558
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:25,133
Look at her, she's not a mother.

559
00:30:25,133 --> 00:30:27,267
- Yes, but I'm the
 next in the box.

560
00:30:27,267 --> 00:30:28,300
- Confound it.

561
00:30:28,300 --> 00:30:30,100
If she were part of the ritual,

562
00:30:30,100 --> 00:30:32,900
one of you would have been
 placed at the station.

563
00:30:32,900 --> 00:30:35,033
It's Joseph's turn now.

564
00:30:35,033 --> 00:30:37,500
We must stick to the plan!

565
00:30:37,500 --> 00:30:39,267
- What are they talking about?

566
00:30:39,267 --> 00:30:40,500
- I don't know.

567
00:30:42,633 --> 00:30:43,600
- August.

568
00:30:43,600 --> 00:30:44,900
- [August] Yeah?

569
00:30:44,900 --> 00:30:47,067
- I think I want you
 to take me home now.

570
00:30:47,067 --> 00:30:48,000
- I'll try.

571
00:30:49,433 --> 00:30:52,000
- I know that's not
 part of the plan!

572
00:30:52,000 --> 00:30:53,167
- Ellen, wait!

573
00:30:54,700 --> 00:30:56,900
There's still so much time.

574
00:30:56,900 --> 00:30:59,500
(wind rushing)

575
00:31:00,700 --> 00:31:02,800
- What are we gonna do?

576
00:31:02,800 --> 00:31:04,500
- We gotta climb the train,

577
00:31:04,500 --> 00:31:07,400
I mean, there's
 nowhere else to go.

578
00:31:08,333 --> 00:31:10,500
(suspenseful music)

579
00:31:10,500 --> 00:31:11,333
Come on.

580
00:31:34,967 --> 00:31:36,233
- [Ellen] Hey you!

581
00:31:36,233 --> 00:31:37,633
- Hmm?

582
00:31:37,633 --> 00:31:38,767
- Let me see your
 license and registration.

583
00:31:38,767 --> 00:31:39,667
- What?

584
00:31:39,667 --> 00:31:40,667
Who are you?

585
00:31:44,067 --> 00:31:45,967
(gasp)

586
00:31:48,267 --> 00:31:50,267
- If none of these work,
 we're in serious trouble.

587
00:31:50,267 --> 00:31:54,433
- (mumbles) we're
 in for a disaster.

588
00:31:58,933 --> 00:32:00,533
It's working!

589
00:32:00,533 --> 00:32:02,833
It's working, keep pulling it!

590
00:32:02,833 --> 00:32:04,067
(creak)

591
00:32:04,067 --> 00:32:06,300
(groaning)

592
00:32:07,567 --> 00:32:09,300
- You heard the conductor.

593
00:32:09,300 --> 00:32:11,067
No tickets, no stops!

594
00:32:12,067 --> 00:32:14,300
(grunting)

595
00:32:18,633 --> 00:32:19,800
- Look out!

596
00:32:19,800 --> 00:32:21,833
- If he stops the train,
we'll lose Joseph.

597
00:32:21,833 --> 00:32:22,667
- Oh yes.

598
00:32:24,433 --> 00:32:26,500
- [August] We gotta jump.

599
00:32:34,200 --> 00:32:36,433
(groaning)

600
00:32:44,100 --> 00:32:47,367
- So this is the perfect world
 I've heard so much about?

601
00:32:47,367 --> 00:32:48,867
- Yeah, I guess I deserve that.

602
00:32:48,867 --> 00:32:50,333
- What is going on, August?

603
00:32:50,333 --> 00:32:52,267
I'm starting to feel
 like Alice in Wonderland.

604
00:32:52,267 --> 00:32:53,667
- I don't know.

605
00:32:53,667 --> 00:32:56,133
I mean, we were in
 the back room, and,

606
00:32:56,133 --> 00:32:58,067
I was just gonna run
 the train for you.

607
00:32:58,067 --> 00:33:00,133
- And I put my
 hand on your hand.

608
00:33:00,133 --> 00:33:01,700
- Right, and,

609
00:33:01,700 --> 00:33:04,933
we were both touching
 the transformer and...

610
00:33:04,933 --> 00:33:05,767
- What?

611
00:33:06,667 --> 00:33:07,500
And what?

612
00:33:08,400 --> 00:33:09,867
- Billy was right.

613
00:33:09,867 --> 00:33:11,767
- Oh, that's a comfort.

614
00:33:19,633 --> 00:33:22,867
- Billy's always saying that
the Dalbys are up to something.

615
00:33:22,867 --> 00:33:24,100
You know, the way
 that they're always

616
00:33:24,100 --> 00:33:26,067
going back there and
 locking that door?

617
00:33:26,067 --> 00:33:27,233
And just today,

618
00:33:27,233 --> 00:33:29,067
Mr. Dalby said it
 was my special day.

619
00:33:29,067 --> 00:33:31,133
He tried to get me
 to run the train.

620
00:33:31,133 --> 00:33:32,400
Just like...

621
00:33:32,400 --> 00:33:33,633
- What, just like what?

622
00:33:33,633 --> 00:33:35,533
- Just like that boy
 in the train station.

623
00:33:35,533 --> 00:33:38,067
Dalby said his journey
 was about to begin.

624
00:33:38,067 --> 00:33:39,167
- So?

625
00:33:39,167 --> 00:33:40,900
- So he's not there anymore.

626
00:33:40,900 --> 00:33:42,333
His chair was empty.

627
00:33:42,333 --> 00:33:44,267
- He probably bailed, August.

628
00:33:44,267 --> 00:33:45,300
He went off to
 terrorize some other

629
00:33:45,300 --> 00:33:46,733
shrunken little kid somewhere.

630
00:33:46,733 --> 00:33:48,400
- I don't think so.

631
00:33:48,400 --> 00:33:49,900
- You think that's
 who we saw in the sky,

632
00:33:49,900 --> 00:33:51,367
that boy's face?

633
00:33:51,367 --> 00:33:53,200
- Yeah, they called him Joseph,

634
00:33:53,200 --> 00:33:55,133
but I don't think
 he's in the sky.

635
00:33:55,133 --> 00:33:57,067
I think he's in the back room.

636
00:33:57,067 --> 00:34:00,067
He's up there in our world and
 I'm stuck down here in his.

637
00:34:00,067 --> 00:34:01,633
- We're both stuck down here.

638
00:34:01,633 --> 00:34:02,633
And I don't know about you,

639
00:34:02,633 --> 00:34:04,333
but I'm ready to
call it a night.

640
00:34:04,333 --> 00:34:06,667
- (sigh) Let's go
 stop the train.

641
00:34:06,667 --> 00:34:09,100
- But I thought if we stopped
 the train they lose Joseph.

642
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:09,933
- Exactly.

643
00:34:10,767 --> 00:34:11,600
Exactly.

644
00:34:12,767 --> 00:34:14,333
Like I know what
 I'm talking about.

645
00:34:14,333 --> 00:34:17,867
I'm out with one of the
 hottest babes in my school.

646
00:34:17,867 --> 00:34:20,067
And I was impressing her.

647
00:34:20,067 --> 00:34:21,767
I know I was.

648
00:34:21,767 --> 00:34:22,600
And then,

649
00:34:23,667 --> 00:34:25,100
this.

650
00:34:25,100 --> 00:34:26,333
(sigh) I better start
 thinking fast or she's never

651
00:34:26,333 --> 00:34:28,200
gonna want to go
 out with me again.

652
00:34:28,200 --> 00:34:30,467
Okay, remember that box?

653
00:34:30,467 --> 00:34:32,367
The ones with the figures in it?

654
00:34:32,367 --> 00:34:34,167
Okay, there was three missing.

655
00:34:34,167 --> 00:34:35,600
Do you remember
 what Mr. Dalby said

656
00:34:35,600 --> 00:34:37,300
to me when I asked him about it?

657
00:34:37,300 --> 00:34:39,300
"Yes, three are lost.

658
00:34:39,300 --> 00:34:42,267
"One permanently, I'm afraid."

659
00:34:42,267 --> 00:34:44,167
See what I'm getting at here?

660
00:34:44,167 --> 00:34:47,500
What if the one that's lost
 is like this Joseph dude?

661
00:34:47,500 --> 00:34:50,400
Only then they lost
 him somehow because,

662
00:34:50,400 --> 00:34:53,567
someone or something
 stopped the train?

663
00:34:53,567 --> 00:34:54,533
Now I don't know
 if it's gonna help

664
00:34:54,533 --> 00:34:56,700
if they lose Joseph, but,

665
00:34:56,700 --> 00:34:57,867
it can't hurt.

666
00:34:58,833 --> 00:34:59,667
Can it?

667
00:35:00,633 --> 00:35:03,533
(mysterious music)

668
00:35:05,867 --> 00:35:08,433
(bell tolling)

669
00:35:09,767 --> 00:35:11,700
(gasp)

670
00:35:13,800 --> 00:35:16,533
(faint creaking)

671
00:35:19,667 --> 00:35:21,633
Ow!
 - [Ellen] What is it?

672
00:35:21,633 --> 00:35:22,867
Are you okay?

673
00:35:22,867 --> 00:35:24,533
- Yeah, it's my leg.

674
00:35:26,500 --> 00:35:29,767
(electricity crackling)

675
00:35:29,767 --> 00:35:30,833
There it is.

676
00:35:30,833 --> 00:35:32,933
- [Ellen] What's that?

677
00:35:32,933 --> 00:35:34,533
- The transformer.

678
00:35:34,533 --> 00:35:35,367
Come on.

679
00:35:42,767 --> 00:35:44,567
Well, this is a problem.

680
00:35:44,567 --> 00:35:46,233
- [Ellen] Okay, now what?

681
00:35:46,233 --> 00:35:47,933
- I don't know, even if
we could get up there,

682
00:35:47,933 --> 00:35:51,067
there's no way we could
move that control.

683
00:35:51,067 --> 00:35:52,233
- What about those screws?

684
00:35:52,233 --> 00:35:53,267
Maybe we can get those loose.

685
00:35:53,267 --> 00:35:55,600
- Stay away from those screws.

686
00:35:55,600 --> 00:35:57,100
At your size they'll fry you.

687
00:35:57,100 --> 00:35:58,900
- Oh, and you're not that
 big yourself, you know?

688
00:35:58,900 --> 00:36:01,167
- Look, you know what I mean.

689
00:36:01,167 --> 00:36:02,600
- Well if we can't
 disconnect these wires

690
00:36:02,600 --> 00:36:04,100
and we can't climb
 up there, then--

691
00:36:04,100 --> 00:36:05,400
- We'll short it out!

692
00:36:05,400 --> 00:36:06,633
- We'll what?

693
00:36:06,633 --> 00:36:07,833
- [August] We'll just
 find something metal

694
00:36:07,833 --> 00:36:09,467
and we can lay it
 across the two screws

695
00:36:09,467 --> 00:36:11,600
and we'll short it out!
(ominous music)

696
00:36:11,600 --> 00:36:13,500
- Uh, August?

697
00:36:13,500 --> 00:36:14,333
August!

698
00:36:15,400 --> 00:36:17,567
(blowing)

699
00:36:20,067 --> 00:36:22,067
- Let's get out of here!

700
00:36:29,500 --> 00:36:30,333
- Dalby!

701
00:36:31,667 --> 00:36:32,500
Dalby!

702
00:36:44,067 --> 00:36:45,633
- What is it, Joseph?

703
00:36:45,633 --> 00:36:47,067
- They've escaped.

704
00:36:47,067 --> 00:36:48,633
- Joseph, what have you done?

705
00:36:48,633 --> 00:36:50,200
- They've escaped the train.

706
00:36:50,200 --> 00:36:53,700
They were here at
 the transformer,
 trying to destroy me.

707
00:36:53,700 --> 00:36:54,867
- What do you mean, they?

708
00:36:54,867 --> 00:36:55,933
- There were two of them, Dalby.

709
00:36:55,933 --> 00:36:57,767
They escaped into the trees.

710
00:36:57,767 --> 00:36:59,167
(rapid breathing)

711
00:36:59,167 --> 00:37:00,567
- Are you okay, August?

712
00:37:00,567 --> 00:37:01,367
- Yeah.

713
00:37:02,700 --> 00:37:04,467
The train's coming.

714
00:37:04,467 --> 00:37:06,267
- Come on, let's go.

715
00:37:06,267 --> 00:37:07,600
- Wait a second.

716
00:37:11,200 --> 00:37:12,333
- We've got to find them.

717
00:37:12,333 --> 00:37:14,133
We must find them at once.

718
00:37:14,133 --> 00:37:15,333
- Mr. Dalby?

719
00:37:15,333 --> 00:37:16,467
- Not now, Mrs. Dalby.

720
00:37:16,467 --> 00:37:17,300
There!

721
00:37:20,200 --> 00:37:22,200
- Come on, we can do it.

722
00:37:24,100 --> 00:37:25,667
- What are they doing?

723
00:37:25,667 --> 00:37:27,200
- They're putting
something on the tracks.

724
00:37:27,200 --> 00:37:28,133
- Mr. Dalby--

725
00:37:28,133 --> 00:37:30,633
- [Joseph] Dalby, do something!

726
00:37:31,667 --> 00:37:33,833
(beeping)

727
00:37:40,900 --> 00:37:42,567
- A little bit more.

728
00:37:44,733 --> 00:37:46,067
- Here it comes.

729
00:37:48,167 --> 00:37:50,833
(Ellen shrieks)

730
00:37:54,567 --> 00:37:57,400
(whistle blowing)

731
00:38:09,633 --> 00:38:10,867
That was close.

732
00:38:15,533 --> 00:38:17,133
- Come on, help me.

733
00:38:22,333 --> 00:38:23,167
- It's too close.

734
00:38:23,167 --> 00:38:24,500
- Come on, push.

735
00:38:28,067 --> 00:38:30,900
(whistle blowing)

736
00:38:50,833 --> 00:38:53,500
- And now I have to get
them back on the train.

737
00:38:53,500 --> 00:38:54,800
- Mr. Dalby.

738
00:38:54,800 --> 00:38:55,733
- Not now, Mrs. Dalby.

739
00:38:55,733 --> 00:38:57,333
Can't you see that I am busy?

740
00:38:57,333 --> 00:38:59,767
- It's the police, Mr. Dalby.

741
00:39:02,133 --> 00:39:03,133
- Joseph, don't touch a thing.

742
00:39:03,133 --> 00:39:04,633
Do you understand me?

743
00:39:04,633 --> 00:39:05,933
- But now is the time, Dalby.

744
00:39:05,933 --> 00:39:07,367
We can find him easily.

745
00:39:07,367 --> 00:39:08,333
- There is plenty of time.

746
00:39:08,333 --> 00:39:09,533
We'll find him.

747
00:39:09,533 --> 00:39:12,200
Now, as I said,
 don't touch a thing.

748
00:39:17,900 --> 00:39:20,067
(August sighs)

749
00:39:20,067 --> 00:39:22,500
- Well that was a bust.

750
00:39:22,500 --> 00:39:24,233
- And I know where we are now.

751
00:39:24,233 --> 00:39:26,067
We'd better get going.

752
00:39:29,133 --> 00:39:30,933
And we'd better hurry.

753
00:39:30,933 --> 00:39:33,767
(music box melody)

754
00:39:33,767 --> 00:39:35,433
Wait, do you hear that?

755
00:39:35,433 --> 00:39:37,667
- No, what is it?

756
00:39:37,667 --> 00:39:40,067
- It sounds like music.

757
00:39:40,067 --> 00:39:41,333
Do you hear it?

758
00:39:42,500 --> 00:39:43,533
- Yeah.

759
00:39:43,533 --> 00:39:45,433
Where's it coming from?

760
00:39:52,533 --> 00:39:55,333
- Well maybe there's somebody
 there that can help us.

761
00:39:55,333 --> 00:39:57,267
- Well Mr. Dalby only
 had one set of figures

762
00:39:57,267 --> 00:39:59,467
and they're on the train.

763
00:39:59,467 --> 00:40:01,133
- Are you sure?

764
00:40:01,133 --> 00:40:02,300
- Pretty sure.

765
00:40:05,233 --> 00:40:07,900
- How can I help the
 police this morning?

766
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:10,467
- Sorry to disturb you
 so early, Mr. Dalby.

767
00:40:10,467 --> 00:40:11,567
I'm Detective Thomaso.

768
00:40:11,567 --> 00:40:13,867
This is Detective Wilson.

769
00:40:13,867 --> 00:40:15,200
- Uh, Mr. Dalby,

770
00:40:16,100 --> 00:40:17,867
do you know this boy?

771
00:40:20,900 --> 00:40:21,900
- Of course.

772
00:40:21,900 --> 00:40:23,533
He's my Auggie.

773
00:40:23,533 --> 00:40:25,600
But you have made a mistake.

774
00:40:25,600 --> 00:40:27,300
You have the wrong boy.

775
00:40:27,300 --> 00:40:28,333
- Pardon me?

776
00:40:28,333 --> 00:40:30,467
- I mean, Auggie's a good boy,

777
00:40:30,467 --> 00:40:32,433
the best help I've ever had.

778
00:40:32,433 --> 00:40:34,300
Whatever has happened,
 I can assure you

779
00:40:34,300 --> 00:40:36,533
Auggie had nothing
 to do with it.

780
00:40:36,533 --> 00:40:39,467
- Mr. Dalby, Auggie didn't
 come home last night.

781
00:40:39,467 --> 00:40:40,467
He's missing.

782
00:40:40,467 --> 00:40:41,300
- What?

783
00:40:42,200 --> 00:40:45,200
- When did you last see Auggie?

784
00:40:45,200 --> 00:40:46,800
- Just last night.

785
00:40:46,800 --> 00:40:49,033
It was his birthday
 and I surprised him

786
00:40:49,033 --> 00:40:51,467
with a remarkable train layout.

787
00:40:51,467 --> 00:40:52,767
It's in the back
 room, detectives.

788
00:40:52,767 --> 00:40:53,733
Would you like to see it?

789
00:40:53,733 --> 00:40:55,600
- That won't be necessary.

790
00:40:55,600 --> 00:40:58,233
Do you recall what time
he left here last night,

791
00:40:58,233 --> 00:40:59,733
Mr. Dalby?

792
00:40:59,733 --> 00:41:02,067
- Well, uh, nearly

793
00:41:02,067 --> 00:41:03,667
6:30.

794
00:41:03,667 --> 00:41:05,867
He was running late for...

795
00:41:05,867 --> 00:41:09,300
- He was running late
 for what, Mr. Dalby?

796
00:41:09,300 --> 00:41:10,400
- For a date.

797
00:41:12,133 --> 00:41:15,433
Of course, for a
date with Ellen.

798
00:41:15,433 --> 00:41:17,733
A lovely girl, beautiful girl.

799
00:41:17,733 --> 00:41:19,833
(laughs) Why not?

800
00:41:19,833 --> 00:41:22,767
Auggie's a handsome
 boy, is he not?

801
00:41:26,633 --> 00:41:29,767
(music box melody)

802
00:41:29,767 --> 00:41:31,500
- What is this place?

803
00:41:32,467 --> 00:41:34,533
- It's brilliant.

804
00:41:34,533 --> 00:41:37,067
- We appreciate your business.

805
00:41:37,067 --> 00:41:38,800
Have a wonderful day.

806
00:41:38,800 --> 00:41:40,900
- Who said that?

807
00:41:40,900 --> 00:41:43,067
- We appreciate your business.

808
00:41:43,067 --> 00:41:45,100
- Are they gonna come
to life and like pelt us

809
00:41:45,100 --> 00:41:46,967
with loaves of bread?

810
00:41:46,967 --> 00:41:49,067
- Nah, it's just an animation.

811
00:41:49,067 --> 00:41:50,933
It's on a continuous loop.

812
00:41:50,933 --> 00:41:53,700
We sell them at the store.

813
00:41:53,700 --> 00:41:54,667
- We appreciate your business.

814
00:41:54,667 --> 00:41:56,967
- Buddy, if you only knew...

815
00:42:07,267 --> 00:42:09,167
It's some party.

816
00:42:09,167 --> 00:42:10,833
Happy birthday, August.

817
00:42:10,833 --> 00:42:11,667
- Yeah.

818
00:42:12,533 --> 00:42:13,967
Thanks.

819
00:42:13,967 --> 00:42:15,200
(Ellen chuckles)

820
00:42:15,200 --> 00:42:16,233
What?

821
00:42:16,233 --> 00:42:17,233
- Nothing.

822
00:42:17,233 --> 00:42:18,067
- What?

823
00:42:18,067 --> 00:42:19,633
- Nothing.

824
00:42:19,633 --> 00:42:22,467
It's just, you were so
 aggressive back there

825
00:42:22,467 --> 00:42:24,333
and I thought you
weren't really into that

826
00:42:24,333 --> 00:42:26,333
He-Man muscle head thing.

827
00:42:26,333 --> 00:42:28,100
- I break it out occasionally.

828
00:42:28,100 --> 00:42:29,633
- Oh you do?

829
00:42:29,633 --> 00:42:31,567
- Well whenever there's a
 damsel in distress around.

830
00:42:31,567 --> 00:42:33,067
- Don't even go there.

831
00:42:33,067 --> 00:42:35,300
- Sorry, I couldn't resist.

832
00:42:36,733 --> 00:42:38,300
- So, you haven't told me
 what the girls are like

833
00:42:38,300 --> 00:42:40,067
in your perfect world.

834
00:42:40,067 --> 00:42:40,933
- I didn't?

835
00:42:42,100 --> 00:42:42,933
Well um...

836
00:42:44,133 --> 00:42:46,500
They're really into movies.

837
00:42:46,500 --> 00:42:48,700
Even really bad horror movies.

838
00:42:48,700 --> 00:42:50,200
- Uh-huh, go on.

839
00:42:50,200 --> 00:42:54,367
- And uh, they have a
 weakness for younger guys.

840
00:42:54,367 --> 00:42:56,300
Just a little younger.

841
00:42:56,300 --> 00:42:58,567
- That sounds more like fantasy.

842
00:42:58,567 --> 00:43:00,067
- Well, you know.

843
00:43:00,067 --> 00:43:01,833
Maybe a birthday wish?

844
00:43:05,233 --> 00:43:07,367
(distant voice)

845
00:43:07,367 --> 00:43:09,667
- Wait, did you hear something?

846
00:43:09,667 --> 00:43:11,133
- What?

847
00:43:11,133 --> 00:43:13,967
- I think it came
 from over there.

848
00:43:17,967 --> 00:43:20,067
Hey, look at that.

849
00:43:20,067 --> 00:43:22,400
A jailhouse in a perfect world.

850
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:25,367
- Yeah, I haven't met anybody
 I didn't want to lock up.

851
00:43:25,367 --> 00:43:26,600
- [Voiceover] We're over here.

852
00:43:26,600 --> 00:43:27,500
In here.

853
00:43:27,500 --> 00:43:29,300
- Did you hear that?

854
00:43:29,300 --> 00:43:30,400
- [Voiceover] We're over here.

855
00:43:30,400 --> 00:43:31,500
In here.

856
00:43:31,500 --> 00:43:33,467
- Somebody's
 expecting a jailbreak.

857
00:43:33,467 --> 00:43:34,800
It's just another loop.

858
00:43:34,800 --> 00:43:37,233
- No, I think it was
 different that time.

859
00:43:37,233 --> 00:43:38,467
- [Voiceover] We're over here.

860
00:43:38,467 --> 00:43:39,400
In here.

861
00:43:39,400 --> 00:43:41,833
- Trust me, it's the same.

862
00:43:41,833 --> 00:43:43,933
Remember, I'm the train guy.

863
00:43:43,933 --> 00:43:45,200
- [Voiceover] In here, children.

864
00:43:45,200 --> 00:43:47,067
We're in here.

865
00:43:47,067 --> 00:43:48,667
- Did she just say children?

866
00:43:48,667 --> 00:43:51,300
- Oh, well maybe no one told
 her it was your birthday.

867
00:43:51,300 --> 00:43:53,900
(Ellen laughs)

868
00:43:57,533 --> 00:43:59,533
(creak)

869
00:44:05,267 --> 00:44:06,700
- In here.

870
00:44:06,700 --> 00:44:07,867
We're in here.

871
00:44:08,967 --> 00:44:10,567
Oh.

872
00:44:10,567 --> 00:44:11,633
You found us.

873
00:44:13,133 --> 00:44:14,433
Oh joy.

874
00:44:14,433 --> 00:44:17,633
You see Landros, I told
you someone would come.

875
00:44:17,633 --> 00:44:19,200
- Landros?

876
00:44:19,200 --> 00:44:21,600
You're Pavel Landros?

877
00:44:21,600 --> 00:44:23,733
- I'm afraid I am.

878
00:44:23,733 --> 00:44:26,567
- Oh, but don't
 blame him, children.

879
00:44:26,567 --> 00:44:29,400
He didn't mean for
 this to happen.

880
00:44:30,767 --> 00:44:33,233
I was having a train
 repaired for my grandson.

881
00:44:33,233 --> 00:44:34,433
It wasn't Landros's fault.

882
00:44:34,433 --> 00:44:35,667
- Shh, that's, that's--

883
00:44:35,667 --> 00:44:36,600
- [Mrs. Ellerbee]
 It wasn't his--

884
00:44:36,600 --> 00:44:38,900
- That's enough, Mrs. Ellerbee.

885
00:44:38,900 --> 00:44:40,167
- Blame you for what?

886
00:44:40,167 --> 00:44:41,167
Who are you?

887
00:44:43,067 --> 00:44:45,600
- I am the creator, my dear.

888
00:44:45,600 --> 00:44:47,967
The train, the
 figures, this place

889
00:44:47,967 --> 00:44:50,200
you find yourself trapped in,

890
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,900
all of it is my doing,
 and all of it is my fault.

891
00:44:53,900 --> 00:44:55,167
- Well great.

892
00:44:55,167 --> 00:44:56,667
We'll just set you free
and then you can help us

893
00:44:56,667 --> 00:44:57,833
get out of here.

894
00:44:57,833 --> 00:44:59,433
I mean, you can do that, right?

895
00:44:59,433 --> 00:45:01,067
- Hmph.

896
00:45:01,067 --> 00:45:04,067
- Tell them about the
 exit knife, Landros.

897
00:45:04,067 --> 00:45:06,300
- Can you get us out of here?

898
00:45:06,300 --> 00:45:08,967
- I am an old man, and I'm weak.

899
00:45:10,833 --> 00:45:12,867
- Wait, how can
 this be your fault?

900
00:45:12,867 --> 00:45:15,300
I mean, Mr. Dalby's the
one that did this to us.

901
00:45:15,300 --> 00:45:17,533
He's the one that tried to
 get me to run the train.

902
00:45:17,533 --> 00:45:20,067
- Dalby does as Dalby must do.

903
00:45:21,367 --> 00:45:23,867
He knows nothing of
 what it is to choose.

904
00:45:23,867 --> 00:45:27,067
I chose for him, by
 opening that door.

905
00:45:28,367 --> 00:45:30,400
I chose for all of them.

906
00:45:30,400 --> 00:45:32,233
- I don't understand.

907
00:45:32,233 --> 00:45:35,100
- In the real world
 I was an outsider,

908
00:45:35,100 --> 00:45:36,600
alone, embittered,

909
00:45:37,733 --> 00:45:39,267
and only in the
 company of my trains

910
00:45:39,267 --> 00:45:41,433
did I feel whole and safe.

911
00:45:42,800 --> 00:45:46,133
So I became obsessed, obsessed
 with my beloved trains,

912
00:45:46,133 --> 00:45:49,700
for they existed in a
 world of my creation.

913
00:45:51,100 --> 00:45:52,333
- A perfect world.

914
00:45:52,333 --> 00:45:53,567
- Yes, perfect.

915
00:45:54,600 --> 00:45:56,767
Or so I thought.

916
00:45:56,767 --> 00:45:58,067
So I traveled.

917
00:45:58,067 --> 00:46:01,933
I traveled the world in
search of sacred texts,

918
00:46:03,333 --> 00:46:07,533
hungry for the secrets
 of ancient civilizations,

919
00:46:07,533 --> 00:46:10,800
thirsting for any knowledge
 that would open the door

920
00:46:10,800 --> 00:46:13,867
and grant me passage
 into this world.

921
00:46:14,800 --> 00:46:17,067
And then suddenly I found it.

922
00:46:17,067 --> 00:46:21,067
I found the spell
 that opened the door.

923
00:46:21,067 --> 00:46:23,600
But something went wrong.

924
00:46:23,600 --> 00:46:25,167
Terribly wrong.

925
00:46:25,167 --> 00:46:27,433
- Thanks, I wasn't aware.

926
00:46:27,433 --> 00:46:28,267
- Yeah.

927
00:46:29,533 --> 00:46:32,367
By opening the
 door to this world,

928
00:46:33,900 --> 00:46:37,300
I unwittingly opened
 the door to another.

929
00:46:38,833 --> 00:46:42,233
My precious figures,
 so lovingly crafted,

930
00:46:43,800 --> 00:46:47,200
became possessed by
 supernatural spirits.

931
00:46:48,167 --> 00:46:49,900
They know nothing of,

932
00:46:51,067 --> 00:46:52,467
of where they come
from, nor did they know

933
00:46:52,467 --> 00:46:55,133
anything of the real world, but,

934
00:46:55,967 --> 00:46:57,400
they lust for it.

935
00:46:58,767 --> 00:47:02,567
And just as I desperately
 covered this world,

936
00:47:02,567 --> 00:47:05,067
they desperately covet yours.

937
00:47:06,633 --> 00:47:09,367
- So Mr. Dalby and
 Mrs. Dalby were just--

938
00:47:09,367 --> 00:47:12,400
- They were toys, August,
 just like Joseph is a toy,

939
00:47:12,400 --> 00:47:15,133
and now he's becoming real
because he's stealing your life.

940
00:47:15,133 --> 00:47:16,333
I mean, how could
 you do this to him?

941
00:47:16,333 --> 00:47:17,167
- Ellen, don't.

942
00:47:17,167 --> 00:47:18,067
- Why August?

943
00:47:18,067 --> 00:47:19,933
I mean, why him?

944
00:47:19,933 --> 00:47:22,700
- Tell me young man,
 how old are you?

945
00:47:22,700 --> 00:47:23,600
- I'm, I'm 15.

946
00:47:23,600 --> 00:47:25,067
- He's 15 today.

947
00:47:25,067 --> 00:47:26,600
So what?

948
00:47:26,600 --> 00:47:29,533
- Then Dalby wasted
 no time at all.

949
00:47:30,933 --> 00:47:34,633
When I crafted Joseph, I
 imagined him a 15-year-old,

950
00:47:34,633 --> 00:47:37,667
a young man on the brink of
 excitement and discovery.

951
00:47:37,667 --> 00:47:39,233
That was my Joseph.

952
00:47:40,767 --> 00:47:43,400
About to embark on the
 journey of a lifetime.

953
00:47:43,400 --> 00:47:44,767
- All right, cut.

954
00:47:44,767 --> 00:47:47,500
This is all very moving,
almost convincing,

955
00:47:47,500 --> 00:47:49,433
but I'm not a fan of melodrama,

956
00:47:49,433 --> 00:47:51,533
and I'm sorry life dealt
 you a bad hand or whatever,

957
00:47:51,533 --> 00:47:53,267
but I happen to like
 the world out there.

958
00:47:53,267 --> 00:47:54,733
I want to get back to it.

959
00:47:54,733 --> 00:47:56,067
We both do.

960
00:47:56,067 --> 00:47:57,800
So if you can't help us,
then we'll be going now.

961
00:47:57,800 --> 00:47:58,733
- Wait.

962
00:47:58,733 --> 00:47:59,533
We can't just leave them here.

963
00:47:59,533 --> 00:48:01,067
What is the exit knife?

964
00:48:01,067 --> 00:48:02,200
- She's right.

965
00:48:02,200 --> 00:48:03,700
You must go.

966
00:48:03,700 --> 00:48:06,867
They will be searching for
 you, and they will not stop

967
00:48:06,867 --> 00:48:09,567
until they get you
 back on that train.

968
00:48:09,567 --> 00:48:11,267
- Tell them, Landros.

969
00:48:11,267 --> 00:48:12,767
- Just tell us already.

970
00:48:12,767 --> 00:48:14,633
- It's an X-Acto knife.

971
00:48:14,633 --> 00:48:16,533
It's over there in the corner.

972
00:48:16,533 --> 00:48:19,167
I broke it when I was
 constructing the jailers.

973
00:48:19,167 --> 00:48:22,400
It was a bit sloppy
 of me, I'm afraid.

974
00:48:22,400 --> 00:48:23,267
Shh.

975
00:48:23,267 --> 00:48:24,100
That's Dalby.

976
00:48:24,100 --> 00:48:25,633
He's searching for you.

977
00:48:25,633 --> 00:48:26,867
You are not safe here now.

978
00:48:26,867 --> 00:48:28,067
- [Ellen] Let's
 go. Listen to him.

979
00:48:28,067 --> 00:48:28,867
- No, wait.

980
00:48:28,867 --> 00:48:29,800
This is just wood.

981
00:48:29,800 --> 00:48:30,767
These are just pieces of wood.

982
00:48:30,767 --> 00:48:32,200
I can get you guys out of here.

983
00:48:32,200 --> 00:48:33,067
- There isn't time.

984
00:48:33,067 --> 00:48:34,500
You must go now.

985
00:48:34,500 --> 00:48:35,933
- [Ellen] Tell us how
 to stop the train.

986
00:48:35,933 --> 00:48:37,500
- Never mind about the train.

987
00:48:37,500 --> 00:48:39,333
Go nowhere near it.

988
00:48:39,333 --> 00:48:40,600
- But I thought if
 we stopped the train,

989
00:48:40,600 --> 00:48:41,733
the ritual would fail.

990
00:48:41,733 --> 00:48:43,600
- Yes, but the
 ritual will also fail

991
00:48:43,600 --> 00:48:46,767
if you're not on the train
 during the final revolution.

992
00:48:46,767 --> 00:48:48,500
- What do you mean,
 the final revolution?

993
00:48:48,500 --> 00:48:50,333
- That's the final lap.

994
00:48:50,333 --> 00:48:53,433
The door between this
 world and your world

995
00:48:53,433 --> 00:48:55,467
will be open only for one year.

996
00:48:55,467 --> 00:48:56,667
- A year?

997
00:48:56,667 --> 00:48:59,067
- Yes, but not a
 year as you know it.

998
00:48:59,067 --> 00:49:02,900
A year here is marked by
a trip around the land,

999
00:49:02,900 --> 00:49:06,300
each day marked by a
 trip past the station,

1000
00:49:06,300 --> 00:49:09,067
and it's signaled
 by the tower clock.

1001
00:49:09,067 --> 00:49:11,433
If the two of you
 are on the train,

1002
00:49:11,433 --> 00:49:14,267
the door between this
 world and your world

1003
00:49:14,267 --> 00:49:16,867
will be closed forever.

1004
00:49:16,867 --> 00:49:18,933
- Yeah, but Ellen's
 not changing.

1005
00:49:18,933 --> 00:49:20,667
She has no part of this.

1006
00:49:20,667 --> 00:49:25,067
- But she's here now 'cause
she accompanied you here, and--

1007
00:49:25,067 --> 00:49:25,900
- Let's go, August.

1008
00:49:25,900 --> 00:49:26,733
Let's get out of here.

1009
00:49:26,733 --> 00:49:27,933
- Wait, I can get this.

1010
00:49:27,933 --> 00:49:31,433
- No, you must go
 with her now, quickly.

1011
00:49:31,433 --> 00:49:33,367
- It's an amazing train.

1012
00:49:33,367 --> 00:49:35,800
I've never seen
 anything like it.

1013
00:49:35,800 --> 00:49:38,867
- It's only a model
 train, young man.

1014
00:49:40,067 --> 00:49:41,433
It's only a model.

1015
00:49:41,433 --> 00:49:43,433
(creak)

1016
00:49:44,600 --> 00:49:47,600
(suspenseful music)

1017
00:49:54,933 --> 00:49:55,833
- Let's go.

1018
00:49:59,133 --> 00:50:02,033
(music box melody)

1019
00:50:07,767 --> 00:50:09,700
- Where have they gone, Dalby?

1020
00:50:09,700 --> 00:50:10,800
You've lost them.

1021
00:50:10,800 --> 00:50:12,933
You've lost them!

1022
00:50:12,933 --> 00:50:15,300
- Mrs. Dalby, the
 light, quickly.

1023
00:50:15,300 --> 00:50:16,700
- Yes, Mr. Dalby.

1024
00:50:30,400 --> 00:50:34,033
- You see, they found them,
 up ahead in the village.

1025
00:50:34,033 --> 00:50:34,867
- Got you.

1026
00:50:36,033 --> 00:50:38,233
- Oh I do hope they
 don't hurt Ellen.

1027
00:50:38,233 --> 00:50:40,900
We've hardly gotten a chance
 to get to know each other.

1028
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:42,467
- They have got the
 whole street lit up,

1029
00:50:42,467 --> 00:50:45,633
and if we go out the front,
they are gonna see us for sure.

1030
00:50:45,633 --> 00:50:48,733
- [August] Well
 there's no back door.

1031
00:50:52,000 --> 00:50:52,933
- August...

1032
00:50:54,100 --> 00:50:55,433
Your, your face.

1033
00:50:57,400 --> 00:50:59,667
- It's not my face anymore.

1034
00:51:01,567 --> 00:51:03,567
(crack)

1035
00:51:05,700 --> 00:51:06,900
What was that?

1036
00:51:06,900 --> 00:51:08,467
- The building
 across the street.

1037
00:51:08,467 --> 00:51:10,567
- [August] There is no
 building across the street.

1038
00:51:10,567 --> 00:51:12,800
- We better get out of
here before we're next.

1039
00:51:12,800 --> 00:51:13,800
- Be careful, Joseph.

1040
00:51:13,800 --> 00:51:15,700
If you kill them
we are finished.

1041
00:51:15,700 --> 00:51:17,467
- He mustn't get away.

1042
00:51:17,467 --> 00:51:19,467
Keep searching!

1043
00:51:19,467 --> 00:51:22,467
(suspenseful music)

1044
00:51:25,867 --> 00:51:28,300
(pounding)

1045
00:51:28,300 --> 00:51:30,467
(shatter)

1046
00:51:32,533 --> 00:51:33,867
- Ow!

1047
00:51:33,867 --> 00:51:34,800
Oh, my leg.

1048
00:51:39,267 --> 00:51:40,100
Come on.

1049
00:51:40,100 --> 00:51:41,267
We've got to go.

1050
00:51:41,267 --> 00:51:42,100
Careful.

1051
00:51:50,533 --> 00:51:52,200
- We only have to hide
 out until the train passes

1052
00:51:52,200 --> 00:51:53,800
the station for the
 last time, right?

1053
00:51:53,800 --> 00:51:55,100
- That's what Landros said.

1054
00:51:55,100 --> 00:51:57,500
- Well let's get out of here.

1055
00:52:15,433 --> 00:52:16,867
Hurry!

1056
00:52:16,867 --> 00:52:17,700
- Too late.

1057
00:52:17,700 --> 00:52:18,967
I can't.

1058
00:52:18,967 --> 00:52:21,300
Just go to the station.

1059
00:52:21,300 --> 00:52:22,200
- August...

1060
00:52:22,200 --> 00:52:23,433
- Go.

1061
00:52:23,433 --> 00:52:25,833
I'll meet you at the station.

1062
00:52:44,567 --> 00:52:46,067
I would have stayed with her,

1063
00:52:46,067 --> 00:52:50,133
but I think she has a
 better chance on her own.

1064
00:52:50,133 --> 00:52:51,833
I'm just gonna lay
 low for a while

1065
00:52:51,833 --> 00:52:54,267
until they stop
 with these lights.

1066
00:52:54,267 --> 00:52:58,633
Besides, I don't like
 Ellen seeing me like this.

1067
00:52:58,633 --> 00:53:00,200
I mean, I stayed home
 from school one day

1068
00:53:00,200 --> 00:53:02,733
'cause I had a pimple
 on my forehead.

1069
00:53:02,733 --> 00:53:06,500
But, I mean, it looked
 like a third eye, but this?

1070
00:53:06,500 --> 00:53:08,733
(raps)

1071
00:53:08,733 --> 00:53:11,133
Talk about unwanted blemishes.

1072
00:53:11,133 --> 00:53:12,367
Plus, my legs are getting stiff.

1073
00:53:12,367 --> 00:53:14,300
I'd just slow her down.

1074
00:53:18,700 --> 00:53:20,733
I think she's better
 off on her own.

1075
00:53:20,733 --> 00:53:23,267
- Okay, meet me at the station?

1076
00:53:23,267 --> 00:53:24,100
Hello?

1077
00:53:25,300 --> 00:53:27,200
Like I can take a
 hint or whatever,

1078
00:53:27,200 --> 00:53:30,567
but just five minutes ago
 he was trying to kiss me.

1079
00:53:30,567 --> 00:53:32,300
He totally was.

1080
00:53:32,300 --> 00:53:33,767
So, I don't know.

1081
00:53:33,767 --> 00:53:36,167
Do you want to limp around
 and turn plastic by yourself,

1082
00:53:36,167 --> 00:53:37,933
or do you want to be with me?

1083
00:53:37,933 --> 00:53:42,833
And like I'm supposed to
 know where the station is.

1084
00:53:42,833 --> 00:53:44,100
- She's smart.

1085
00:53:44,100 --> 00:53:46,100
She'll be able to
 find the station.

1086
00:53:46,100 --> 00:53:47,933
She's gonna be okay.

1087
00:53:47,933 --> 00:53:49,200
I'm sure of it.

1088
00:53:52,500 --> 00:53:53,333
(Ellen screams)

1089
00:53:53,333 --> 00:53:55,267
(thud)

1090
00:53:59,533 --> 00:54:01,533
- Thank you, Mrs. Dalby.

1091
00:54:04,633 --> 00:54:06,267
- Well what good is she?

1092
00:54:06,267 --> 00:54:07,700
It's the boy.

1093
00:54:07,700 --> 00:54:09,567
It's the boy who
 must be on the train.

1094
00:54:09,567 --> 00:54:11,167
- Don't worry, Joseph.

1095
00:54:11,167 --> 00:54:13,100
You do not know
 human boys as I do.

1096
00:54:13,100 --> 00:54:14,933
- But I am a human boy.

1097
00:54:14,933 --> 00:54:18,767
- Besides Joseph, it's time
 we must open the store.

1098
00:54:18,767 --> 00:54:19,700
- But why?

1099
00:54:19,700 --> 00:54:20,733
Why open the store at all?

1100
00:54:20,733 --> 00:54:22,267
We haven't found the boy yet.

1101
00:54:22,267 --> 00:54:24,233
- The boy will show
 himself, Joseph.

1102
00:54:24,233 --> 00:54:25,533
Trust me.

1103
00:54:25,533 --> 00:54:28,533
Now, it is important
that we open the store.

1104
00:54:28,533 --> 00:54:30,567
The police are
 gone for now, but,

1105
00:54:30,567 --> 00:54:33,333
should they return, they
mustn't find anything

1106
00:54:33,333 --> 00:54:35,467
out of the ordinary.

1107
00:54:35,467 --> 00:54:38,333
Nothing to arouse
 their suspicions,

1108
00:54:38,333 --> 00:54:42,333
especially with a life-size
 boy made of plastic.

1109
00:54:44,067 --> 00:54:46,667
You will stay in the
back room, out of sight,

1110
00:54:46,667 --> 00:54:50,567
at least until your
 transformation is more

1111
00:54:50,567 --> 00:54:51,400
complete.

1112
00:55:36,400 --> 00:55:37,400
Why, Billy!

1113
00:55:37,400 --> 00:55:38,333
- Hi Mr. Dalby.

1114
00:55:38,333 --> 00:55:39,533
- Hi.

1115
00:55:39,533 --> 00:55:41,500
Hey, tell me about your
sister, and Auggie.

1116
00:55:41,500 --> 00:55:42,633
Have they found them?

1117
00:55:42,633 --> 00:55:44,167
- How did you know?

1118
00:55:44,167 --> 00:55:48,433
- Why, the police, they came
 here early this morning.

1119
00:55:48,433 --> 00:55:50,600
Oh I'm so worried, Billy.

1120
00:55:50,600 --> 00:55:52,067
Have they come home yet?

1121
00:55:52,067 --> 00:55:53,733
- No, not yet.

1122
00:55:53,733 --> 00:55:55,400
- Oh dear.

1123
00:55:55,400 --> 00:55:57,267
Very very disappointing.

1124
00:55:57,267 --> 00:56:00,400
But you'll come and tell
me as soon as they do?

1125
00:56:00,400 --> 00:56:01,833
Won't you, Billy?

1126
00:56:01,833 --> 00:56:03,833
- I think I'm just gonna
 hang here for a little while.

1127
00:56:03,833 --> 00:56:05,367
- Billy, Billy.

1128
00:56:05,367 --> 00:56:06,767
Come on, we're not--

1129
00:56:06,767 --> 00:56:07,700
- Please, Mr. Dalby.

1130
00:56:07,700 --> 00:56:08,833
I'm just in the way at home.

1131
00:56:08,833 --> 00:56:10,567
My parents are
 totally freaking out.

1132
00:56:10,567 --> 00:56:12,733
I promise, I won't
 touch anything.

1133
00:56:12,733 --> 00:56:13,633
Please?

1134
00:56:13,633 --> 00:56:15,533
- Why, of course, Billy.

1135
00:56:15,533 --> 00:56:17,200
Of course you can stay.

1136
00:56:17,200 --> 00:56:20,100
Oh, have you eaten anything, hm?

1137
00:56:20,100 --> 00:56:21,767
- There, you see?

1138
00:56:21,767 --> 00:56:25,933
- Thanks, Mr. Dalby.
 (Mrs. Dalby laughs)

1139
00:56:31,433 --> 00:56:34,267
(whistle blowing)

1140
00:56:42,900 --> 00:56:45,733
(whistle blowing)

1141
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:50,067
- Ellen?

1142
00:56:52,167 --> 00:56:53,267
Are you here?

1143
00:56:57,333 --> 00:56:58,167
Ellen?

1144
00:57:01,633 --> 00:57:02,467
Ellen?

1145
00:57:05,167 --> 00:57:06,067
It's me.

1146
00:57:07,333 --> 00:57:10,267
(mysterious music)

1147
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,067
(whistle blowing)

1148
00:57:16,367 --> 00:57:19,100
(train chugging)

1149
00:57:22,633 --> 00:57:23,467
Ellen?

1150
00:57:24,833 --> 00:57:27,433
(bell tolling)

1151
00:57:34,067 --> 00:57:35,267
- Good morning.

1152
00:57:37,433 --> 00:57:39,500
That's what you say, isn't it?

1153
00:57:39,500 --> 00:57:41,300
When someone wakes up?

1154
00:57:41,300 --> 00:57:42,400
Good morning?

1155
00:57:43,833 --> 00:57:44,967
- Where's August?

1156
00:57:44,967 --> 00:57:46,867
- No, don't worry about him.

1157
00:57:46,867 --> 00:57:48,500
He'll be along shortly.

1158
00:57:48,500 --> 00:57:50,367
- Dalby seems to
 think so, anyway.

1159
00:57:50,367 --> 00:57:52,267
- It's unacceptable
 if you ask me,

1160
00:57:52,267 --> 00:57:55,433
an unacceptable risk he's
 taking with Joseph's life.

1161
00:57:55,433 --> 00:57:57,100
- It isn't Joseph's life.

1162
00:57:57,100 --> 00:58:00,100
He doesn't have a life, and
 he isn't gonna be getting one.

1163
00:58:00,100 --> 00:58:02,133
August is gonna come
nowhere near this train.

1164
00:58:02,133 --> 00:58:05,600
- Oh but, then you'll
 perish along with Joseph.

1165
00:58:05,600 --> 00:58:09,367
Surely Auggie won't let
that happen, will he?

1166
00:58:11,067 --> 00:58:14,933
Tell me Ellen, what do girls
 like us do in your world?

1167
00:58:14,933 --> 00:58:16,100
- Girls like us?

1168
00:58:16,100 --> 00:58:16,933
- Yes.

1169
00:58:16,933 --> 00:58:18,633
What can I expect?

1170
00:58:18,633 --> 00:58:20,233
Once I'm human, I mean.

1171
00:58:20,233 --> 00:58:22,233
- You are never
 going to be human.

1172
00:58:22,233 --> 00:58:23,667
- What do you mean?

1173
00:58:23,667 --> 00:58:26,333
- What I mean is, we're gonna
 get out of here somehow,

1174
00:58:26,333 --> 00:58:28,733
and when I do, I'm gonna
 make it my life's mission

1175
00:58:28,733 --> 00:58:30,800
to see that you never get
 out of your own box again.

1176
00:58:30,800 --> 00:58:31,633
- Oh dear.

1177
00:58:43,633 --> 00:58:44,467
- Whoa.

1178
00:58:45,633 --> 00:58:47,467
Where'd you come from?

1179
00:58:54,400 --> 00:58:57,900
(mysterious exotic music)

1180
00:59:33,667 --> 00:59:36,233
- Billy, what are you doing?

1181
00:59:36,233 --> 00:59:38,833
- Is Mrs. Dalby doing
 inventory in there?

1182
00:59:38,833 --> 00:59:41,300
- [Mr. Dalby] Mrs. Dalby?

1183
00:59:41,300 --> 00:59:44,467
- How did you like
 your brownie, Billy.

1184
00:59:44,467 --> 00:59:46,200
- Yeah, thanks Mrs. Dalby.

1185
00:59:46,200 --> 00:59:47,900
- There is no one in
 the back room, Billy.

1186
00:59:47,900 --> 00:59:49,333
Why do you ask?

1187
00:59:49,333 --> 00:59:50,267
- I just...

1188
00:59:51,133 --> 00:59:52,333
I don't know.

1189
00:59:52,333 --> 00:59:54,400
- Maybe it's time
 you went home, Billy.

1190
00:59:54,400 --> 00:59:57,533
Perhaps your sister is
 home now, and Auggie too.

1191
00:59:57,533 --> 00:59:59,433
- Yeah, okay.

1192
00:59:59,433 --> 01:00:00,367
Okay.

1193
01:00:00,367 --> 01:00:01,933
Maybe you're right.

1194
01:00:03,067 --> 01:00:03,933
(Billy grunts)

1195
01:00:03,933 --> 01:00:05,900
Can you say, wrong?

1196
01:00:05,900 --> 01:00:07,567
There's somebody back
 there, all right.

1197
01:00:07,567 --> 01:00:09,333
I'd bet my Play Station on it.

1198
01:00:09,333 --> 01:00:12,333
First of all, Dalby was just
 talking to someone back there,

1199
01:00:12,333 --> 01:00:14,267
and someone was just
 tugging on the door.

1200
01:00:14,267 --> 01:00:18,500
That was not my imagination,
 overactive or otherwise.

1201
01:00:18,500 --> 01:00:21,067
But you know how
I know for sure?

1202
01:00:21,067 --> 01:00:24,300
Whenever adults break out
 those phony ear-to-ear smiles

1203
01:00:24,300 --> 01:00:25,967
and start offering
 you plates of brownies

1204
01:00:25,967 --> 01:00:28,200
and cookies and stuff,

1205
01:00:28,200 --> 01:00:30,867
man, you can be
 sure something's up.

1206
01:00:30,867 --> 01:00:32,067
I've been around a
 long time, you know,

1207
01:00:32,067 --> 01:00:34,600
and you can't con a con man.

1208
01:00:34,600 --> 01:00:36,467
There's one thing
 that bugs me though.

1209
01:00:36,467 --> 01:00:38,633
If it was August or Ellen
 back there and they were

1210
01:00:38,633 --> 01:00:41,600
in trouble, why would they
 tug on the door like that?

1211
01:00:41,600 --> 01:00:43,767
Maybe someone else
 is back there.

1212
01:00:43,767 --> 01:00:46,333
One thing's for sure,
those Dalbys are lying.

1213
01:00:46,333 --> 01:00:48,167
And whoever is back
 there, has something to do

1214
01:00:48,167 --> 01:00:49,733
with August and my sister.

1215
01:00:49,733 --> 01:00:51,167
I'm gonna prove it.

1216
01:00:51,167 --> 01:00:54,667
A kid with my rep,
you've got to prove it.

1217
01:00:55,600 --> 01:00:57,933
(birds coo)

1218
01:01:29,067 --> 01:01:32,400
(hammering and scraping)

1219
01:01:38,967 --> 01:01:40,967
(clang)

1220
01:01:43,933 --> 01:01:45,833
(thud)

1221
01:02:09,667 --> 01:02:10,567
Whoa, cool.

1222
01:02:12,667 --> 01:02:16,900
(mysterious exotic music)

1223
01:02:16,900 --> 01:02:17,733
August?

1224
01:02:18,767 --> 01:02:19,600
Ellie?

1225
01:02:19,600 --> 01:02:20,933
Are you in here?

1226
01:02:22,333 --> 01:02:23,933
Ellie, is that you?

1227
01:02:24,967 --> 01:02:25,800
August?

1228
01:02:54,267 --> 01:02:55,333
- You lookin' for me?

1229
01:02:55,333 --> 01:02:56,867
(Billy gasps)

1230
01:02:56,867 --> 01:02:59,067
(Joseph shrieks)

1231
01:02:59,067 --> 01:03:00,400
(clatter)

1232
01:03:00,400 --> 01:03:03,100
(dramatic music)

1233
01:03:06,067 --> 01:03:08,233
(clatter)

1234
01:03:11,067 --> 01:03:13,400
- Please watch the
 register, Mrs. Dalby.

1235
01:03:13,400 --> 01:03:14,800
- Yes, Mr. Dalby.

1236
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:23,267
- [Mr. Dalby] Joseph,
 what have you done?

1237
01:03:23,267 --> 01:03:24,533
- A boy!

1238
01:03:24,533 --> 01:03:26,467
There was a boy, Dalby.

1239
01:03:29,467 --> 01:03:32,967
He was looking for them,
calling their names.

1240
01:03:32,967 --> 01:03:33,800
He saw me.

1241
01:03:36,900 --> 01:03:38,067
What do we do?

1242
01:03:40,300 --> 01:03:42,067
- Nothing.

1243
01:03:42,067 --> 01:03:45,600
No one will believe
 the fantastic story
 he's about to tell.

1244
01:03:45,600 --> 01:03:48,433
(whistle blowing)

1245
01:03:50,733 --> 01:03:53,300
(bell tolling)

1246
01:04:02,333 --> 01:04:03,333
- Of course.

1247
01:04:04,300 --> 01:04:06,900
Who would believe such a thing?

1248
01:04:17,900 --> 01:04:19,967
- We should be going slower.

1249
01:04:19,967 --> 01:04:24,133
He'll never be able to get
 on the train at this speed.

1250
01:04:31,533 --> 01:04:34,367
(whistle blowing)

1251
01:04:40,300 --> 01:04:41,200
Look, there he is.

1252
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:42,067
Look!

1253
01:04:53,567 --> 01:04:54,600
- Yes.

1254
01:04:54,600 --> 01:04:55,433
August.

1255
01:05:01,067 --> 01:05:02,167
- He's on board.

1256
01:05:02,167 --> 01:05:03,333
He's on board.

1257
01:05:05,867 --> 01:05:08,867
- Let's see that
 he doesn't get off.

1258
01:05:23,467 --> 01:05:26,267
- Oh, good afternoon, officers.

1259
01:05:26,267 --> 01:05:27,933
Hello Billy.

1260
01:05:27,933 --> 01:05:29,667
Good news I hope.

1261
01:05:29,667 --> 01:05:31,567
- Not yet, Mr. Dalby.

1262
01:05:31,567 --> 01:05:34,333
Actually, we're here for
a few more questions.

1263
01:05:34,333 --> 01:05:36,667
- Of course, anything I can do.

1264
01:05:36,667 --> 01:05:38,767
- Billy came to us with, um,

1265
01:05:38,767 --> 01:05:40,833
well, quite a story.

1266
01:05:40,833 --> 01:05:43,167
- (laughs) Yes, it is his gift.

1267
01:05:43,167 --> 01:05:44,767
- Ask him about the back room.

1268
01:05:44,767 --> 01:05:46,300
- The back room?

1269
01:05:46,300 --> 01:05:48,633
- Billy claims to have seen
 somebody in your back room.

1270
01:05:48,633 --> 01:05:50,600
- But there is no
 one back there.

1271
01:05:50,600 --> 01:05:53,767
(laughs) Mice perhaps,
 and trains of course.

1272
01:05:53,767 --> 01:05:56,867
- Mr. Dalby, do you and
 your wife live here alone?

1273
01:05:56,867 --> 01:05:59,400
- Yes, but there is our grandson

1274
01:05:59,400 --> 01:06:01,067
visiting from out of town.

1275
01:06:01,067 --> 01:06:03,433
- And you keep him
locked in the back room?

1276
01:06:03,433 --> 01:06:04,633
- Billy.

1277
01:06:04,633 --> 01:06:06,433
Of course not.

1278
01:06:06,433 --> 01:06:08,800
- Would you mind if we
speak to your grandson?

1279
01:06:08,800 --> 01:06:10,333
(door clicks)

1280
01:06:10,333 --> 01:06:12,833
- Uh, here he is now.

1281
01:06:12,833 --> 01:06:17,433
Joseph, these police detectives
would like to speak to you.

1282
01:06:17,433 --> 01:06:19,067
They would like to
 know if your grandpa

1283
01:06:19,067 --> 01:06:21,667
keeps you locked
 in the back room.

1284
01:06:21,667 --> 01:06:25,333
- Billy, is this the
boy you saw back there?

1285
01:06:26,233 --> 01:06:27,100
- Yes.

1286
01:06:27,100 --> 01:06:28,800
I mean, no.

1287
01:06:28,800 --> 01:06:30,467
He's different now.

1288
01:06:30,467 --> 01:06:32,067
- Billy, it was you?

1289
01:06:32,067 --> 01:06:33,700
We thought we had prowlers.

1290
01:06:33,700 --> 01:06:35,833
Joseph, was it
 Billy you surprised?

1291
01:06:35,833 --> 01:06:37,967
- I'm sorry if I scared you.

1292
01:06:37,967 --> 01:06:39,867
I thought you were a burglar.

1293
01:06:39,867 --> 01:06:40,833
- Look at his hands.

1294
01:06:40,833 --> 01:06:42,867
Make him show you his hands.

1295
01:06:42,867 --> 01:06:43,700
- My hands?

1296
01:06:43,700 --> 01:06:45,067
Which hand?

1297
01:06:45,067 --> 01:06:47,233
What's wrong with my hands?

1298
01:07:02,733 --> 01:07:05,767
- Please officers,
 go and have a look.

1299
01:07:05,767 --> 01:07:07,133
We have no secrets here.

1300
01:07:07,133 --> 01:07:08,467
- They're lying, I know it.

1301
01:07:08,467 --> 01:07:09,300
- Come on, kid.

1302
01:07:09,300 --> 01:07:10,500
Take it easy.

1303
01:07:10,500 --> 01:07:13,067
- Billy, do you think
 me such a monster?

1304
01:07:13,067 --> 01:07:14,700
And Mrs. Dalby?

1305
01:07:14,700 --> 01:07:17,267
We are concerned for
 Auggie, and for Ellen.

1306
01:07:17,267 --> 01:07:19,567
Please, stop with this
 fantastic story, will you?

1307
01:07:19,567 --> 01:07:20,533
- I'm not making it up.

1308
01:07:20,533 --> 01:07:21,367
He was different.

1309
01:07:21,367 --> 01:07:22,333
He wasn't human.

1310
01:07:22,333 --> 01:07:23,600
- Billy, please.

1311
01:07:23,600 --> 01:07:25,067
- [Detective Wilson]
 Billy, that's enough.

1312
01:07:25,067 --> 01:07:26,833
- I know he did something
 with August and Ellen.

1313
01:07:26,833 --> 01:07:27,933
I know it.

1314
01:07:27,933 --> 01:07:28,900
(thud)

1315
01:07:28,900 --> 01:07:30,300
(dramatic music)

1316
01:07:30,300 --> 01:07:31,133
- Oh!

1317
01:07:32,067 --> 01:07:35,367
(rumbling and creaking)

1318
01:07:37,367 --> 01:07:38,767
- [Ellen] August!

1319
01:07:41,200 --> 01:07:43,300
- Sorry, Mr. Dalby, Mrs. Dalby.

1320
01:07:43,300 --> 01:07:44,700
We'll be in touch.

1321
01:07:44,700 --> 01:07:45,533
- Come on.

1322
01:07:49,933 --> 01:07:53,367
(grunting and scuffling)

1323
01:07:59,200 --> 01:08:00,267
(hiss)

1324
01:08:00,267 --> 01:08:01,967
- Oh, what is it now?

1325
01:08:04,200 --> 01:08:05,067
- You okay?

1326
01:08:05,067 --> 01:08:06,867
- Yeah, just untie me.

1327
01:08:11,267 --> 01:08:12,267
- Turn away.

1328
01:08:13,567 --> 01:08:14,833
(shatter)

1329
01:08:14,833 --> 01:08:16,067
- Blast it.

1330
01:08:16,067 --> 01:08:17,067
What a mess.

1331
01:08:25,167 --> 01:08:27,767
No, you are not going anywhere.

1332
01:08:29,967 --> 01:08:31,067
Blast it.

1333
01:08:31,067 --> 01:08:32,467
I'm melting.

1334
01:08:32,467 --> 01:08:33,467
I'm melting!

1335
01:08:34,700 --> 01:08:35,533
- There.

1336
01:08:35,533 --> 01:08:36,367
Let's go.

1337
01:08:48,633 --> 01:08:50,967
- We have to get off the train.

1338
01:08:50,967 --> 01:08:52,400
There's no other way.

1339
01:08:52,400 --> 01:08:54,067
- There is no way
 I can jump, August.

1340
01:08:54,067 --> 01:08:56,200
We are going too fast.

1341
01:08:56,200 --> 01:08:58,067
Can't we slow it down?

1342
01:08:58,067 --> 01:09:00,267
- We have to get off the train.

1343
01:09:00,267 --> 01:09:03,100
I'm sorry Ellen,
 but we have to jump.

1344
01:09:03,100 --> 01:09:04,800
- Then jump.

1345
01:09:04,800 --> 01:09:05,633
- What?

1346
01:09:05,633 --> 01:09:06,633
- Jump.

1347
01:09:06,633 --> 01:09:07,833
You're almost totally plastic.

1348
01:09:07,833 --> 01:09:09,300
If you jump, it
 won't hurt anything.

1349
01:09:09,300 --> 01:09:11,233
- I can't just leave you here.

1350
01:09:11,233 --> 01:09:12,567
- You have to.

1351
01:09:12,567 --> 01:09:14,100
If you're on the
 train when we pass

1352
01:09:14,100 --> 01:09:16,100
through the station, you're
 gonna be stuck here forever.

1353
01:09:16,100 --> 01:09:18,500
- I am not gonna leave you.

1354
01:09:18,500 --> 01:09:20,133
- It's your only chance, August.

1355
01:09:20,133 --> 01:09:21,767
You have to.

1356
01:09:21,767 --> 01:09:22,933
I want you to.

1357
01:09:29,300 --> 01:09:30,733
- Wait.

1358
01:09:30,733 --> 01:09:32,500
It's just a model train.

1359
01:09:32,500 --> 01:09:34,067
It's just a model.

1360
01:09:36,367 --> 01:09:37,733
- [Conductor] Stop them.

1361
01:09:37,733 --> 01:09:38,567
Stop them!

1362
01:09:39,733 --> 01:09:41,400
- There's another way.

1363
01:09:41,400 --> 01:09:42,633
- August, look.

1364
01:09:44,467 --> 01:09:46,633
- We can tie it with this.

1365
01:09:55,067 --> 01:09:55,900
- Open up!

1366
01:10:04,467 --> 01:10:05,900
- Okay, now what?

1367
01:10:07,867 --> 01:10:09,133
- We get that unhooked.

1368
01:10:09,133 --> 01:10:11,833
(whistle blowing)

1369
01:10:11,833 --> 01:10:13,000
- Let's do it.

1370
01:10:17,533 --> 01:10:19,433
(wind)

1371
01:10:19,433 --> 01:10:20,933
- All right, go on the plastic.

1372
01:10:20,933 --> 01:10:21,767
Grab it.

1373
01:10:24,300 --> 01:10:25,867
Keep pulling.

1374
01:10:25,867 --> 01:10:26,700
- Harder?

1375
01:10:29,800 --> 01:10:32,133
- For some reason
 they're pulling.

1376
01:10:32,133 --> 01:10:33,267
- I'll stop them.

1377
01:10:33,267 --> 01:10:34,933
- We are too close now.

1378
01:10:34,933 --> 01:10:37,600
We can only hope that they fail.

1379
01:10:39,867 --> 01:10:40,867
- We're missing it.

1380
01:10:40,867 --> 01:10:41,833
- What?

1381
01:10:41,833 --> 01:10:43,900
- [August] It should be here.

1382
01:10:43,900 --> 01:10:44,733
It's not.

1383
01:10:48,567 --> 01:10:49,400
- Hurry.

1384
01:10:53,467 --> 01:10:54,500
- All right, I got it, I got it.

1385
01:10:54,500 --> 01:10:55,333
Pull.

1386
01:10:55,333 --> 01:10:56,167
Pull.

1387
01:10:58,000 --> 01:11:00,167
- They're gonna get away!

1388
01:11:04,433 --> 01:11:08,600
- Apparently the engineer
 doesn't share your pessimism.

1389
01:11:12,133 --> 01:11:12,967
- Now.

1390
01:11:15,300 --> 01:11:16,133
Come on.

1391
01:11:23,300 --> 01:11:25,633
- You're not going anywhere.

1392
01:11:27,333 --> 01:11:28,600
- That's it.

1393
01:11:28,600 --> 01:11:29,500
Stop them.

1394
01:11:29,500 --> 01:11:31,167
Stop them you fools.

1395
01:11:46,067 --> 01:11:48,333
- Sorry to spoil
your fun, Ellen.

1396
01:11:48,333 --> 01:11:50,133
- Have you ever seen
 a Jackie Chan movie?

1397
01:11:50,133 --> 01:11:53,200
- No, but it sounds interesting.

1398
01:11:53,200 --> 01:11:56,167
(Girl screams)

1399
01:11:56,167 --> 01:11:58,867
- Well that's as close
 as you're gonna get.

1400
01:11:58,867 --> 01:11:59,700
- Help!

1401
01:12:02,067 --> 01:12:02,900
- Got it.

1402
01:12:09,400 --> 01:12:11,467
(exhale)

1403
01:12:16,833 --> 01:12:18,533
- We made it, young man.

1404
01:12:18,533 --> 01:12:19,567
- Yeah.

1405
01:12:19,567 --> 01:12:20,400
Go team.

1406
01:12:22,500 --> 01:12:23,833
- Get off of me!

1407
01:12:31,300 --> 01:12:33,533
(laughter)

1408
01:13:00,133 --> 01:13:02,333
(creaking)

1409
01:13:08,100 --> 01:13:10,533
(shattering)

1410
01:13:33,233 --> 01:13:34,833
- August?

1411
01:13:34,833 --> 01:13:36,733
August, wake up.

1412
01:13:36,733 --> 01:13:37,967
Wake up.

1413
01:13:37,967 --> 01:13:39,133
- [August] Mr. Landros?

1414
01:13:39,133 --> 01:13:40,367
- In the flesh.

1415
01:13:42,233 --> 01:13:44,267
Mrs. Ellerbee too.

1416
01:13:44,267 --> 01:13:46,533
And it's all thanks to you.

1417
01:13:46,533 --> 01:13:47,533
Welcome back.

1418
01:13:47,533 --> 01:13:50,267
(peaceful music)

1419
01:13:50,267 --> 01:13:51,500
- Ellen.

1420
01:13:51,500 --> 01:13:53,833
- [Pavel] Right
 there beside you.

1421
01:13:53,833 --> 01:13:55,767
- Ellen, we're back.

1422
01:13:55,767 --> 01:13:58,367
- Is that you August?

1423
01:13:58,367 --> 01:13:59,200
- Hi.

1424
01:14:04,533 --> 01:14:06,800
- Would you look at
this sunshine, children?

1425
01:14:06,800 --> 01:14:08,300
Isn't it glorious?

1426
01:14:14,900 --> 01:14:16,800
- I uh, don't know
 if your grandson

1427
01:14:16,800 --> 01:14:20,700
still likes model
trains, but if he does,

1428
01:14:20,700 --> 01:14:22,167
this is a pretty good one.

1429
01:14:22,167 --> 01:14:23,100
- Oh.

1430
01:14:23,100 --> 01:14:24,833
That's sweet of you, August.

1431
01:14:24,833 --> 01:14:26,367
He might like it.

1432
01:14:26,367 --> 01:14:28,900
But if he doesn't,
 would it be all right

1433
01:14:28,900 --> 01:14:30,733
if I smashed it to bits?

1434
01:14:30,733 --> 01:14:31,967
(laughter)

1435
01:14:31,967 --> 01:14:32,900
- Sure.

1436
01:14:32,900 --> 01:14:34,900
- Goodbye, Mrs. Ellerbee.

1437
01:14:43,867 --> 01:14:46,600
- I'm sorry I wigged out on
 you back there, Mr. Landros.

1438
01:14:46,600 --> 01:14:48,833
- Oh, nonsense my dear.

1439
01:14:48,833 --> 01:14:51,367
You merely pointed
 out the obvious.

1440
01:14:51,367 --> 01:14:52,500
- I did?

1441
01:14:52,500 --> 01:14:53,767
- Yes.

1442
01:14:53,767 --> 01:14:57,467
One should play the hand
one is dealt in life.

1443
01:14:57,467 --> 01:15:00,967
We have no business
 dealing for ourselves.

1444
01:15:04,167 --> 01:15:07,333
Mrs. Ellerbee was
 right about the sun.

1445
01:15:08,267 --> 01:15:10,833
It is a glorious day.

1446
01:15:10,833 --> 01:15:13,167
It's a perfect day, eh August?

1447
01:15:13,167 --> 01:15:15,333
- Well, nothing's perfect.

1448
01:15:16,467 --> 01:15:19,067
- Right you are, my boy.

1449
01:15:19,067 --> 01:15:20,200
Right you are.

1450
01:15:22,667 --> 01:15:23,500
Buh-bye.

1451
01:15:28,367 --> 01:15:30,800
- So August, how do you feel?

1452
01:15:32,167 --> 01:15:33,567
- Good.

1453
01:15:33,567 --> 01:15:35,333
How do you feel?

1454
01:15:35,333 --> 01:15:36,267
- I'm okay.

1455
01:15:42,900 --> 01:15:44,167
Getting better.

1456
01:15:45,467 --> 01:15:47,800
- Hey uh, next time
 we go to the movies...

1457
01:15:47,800 --> 01:15:48,733
- Yeah?

1458
01:15:48,733 --> 01:15:50,200
- Let's go bowling instead.

1459
01:15:50,200 --> 01:15:51,067
- Okay.

1460
01:15:59,100 --> 01:16:02,767
(haunting mysterious music)

1461
01:17:45,667 --> 01:17:49,333
(exotic instrumental music)
