[crows cawing]

00:01:14,258 --> 00:01:16,027
[Tanner] It was literally
one of the most traumatizing

4
00:01:16,160 --> 00:01:18,029
I've ever had in
my whole goddamned life.

5
00:01:18,162 --> 00:01:20,664
[person] Turn that shit down.
Ain't gonna tell you guys again.

6
00:01:20,797 --> 00:01:23,334
[Tanner] It was probably my 8th birthday.
My mother was yelling at me.

7
00:01:23,466 --> 00:01:26,370
She was like, "Hey, you clown. Why
don't you go to the fucking clown prison

8
00:01:26,503 --> 00:01:28,805
or the circus is gonna come
over here and take you away

9
00:01:28,940 --> 00:01:31,375
with all the rest of you
and the rest of the clowns."

10
00:01:31,508 --> 00:01:33,945
That's what she kept telling me,
because my mom was a clown,

11
00:01:34,078 --> 00:01:36,347
just like you two clowns,
playing this NSA bullshit.

12
00:01:36,479 --> 00:01:39,350
That's what it is, you clowns.
Two fucking clowns!

13
00:01:39,482 --> 00:01:41,451
Goddamn it,
I gotta take a shit.

[rock music playing

15
00:02:00,570 --> 00:02:02,139
All right, you guys ready?

16
00:02:02,273 --> 00:02:04,774
Rakestraw, you and me,
we're taking the front.

17
00:02:04,909 --> 00:02:07,644
- Bledsoe, Manningham, around the rear.
- Copy.

18
00:02:07,777 --> 00:02:09,779
Let's take these fuckers down.

19
00:02:46,917 --> 00:02:48,651
[Fulbright] Hey!
Get down, get down, get down, get down!

20
00:02:48,785 --> 00:02:50,720
- Get down, get down, get down!
- [gunfire]

21
00:02:50,855 --> 00:02:52,857
Get the fuck down!
Get the fuck down!

22
00:02:55,893 --> 00:02:58,762
Put your fucking hands
in the fucking air!

Shots fired, officer down.
Officer down.

26
00:03:46,010 --> 00:03:47,344
Fuck!

Careful.

One more step.

31
00:04:12,669 --> 00:04:15,339
[radio chatter continues]

32
00:04:26,217 --> 00:04:27,684
- Yeah.
- Yeah.

33
00:04:40,730 --> 00:04:42,566
[Rakestraw] He had a gun.

34
00:04:42,699 --> 00:04:44,335
Not on us.

35
00:04:44,468 --> 00:04:47,304
No, wasn't our fault.

36
00:04:51,808 --> 00:04:54,245
[Rakestraw] We were just
doing our jobs.

37
00:04:54,378 --> 00:04:56,147
Just doing our job.

38
00:04:57,448 --> 00:04:58,815
Yeah.

- Maybe.
- I'm not sure if you heard,

58
00:06:14,191 --> 00:06:15,825

59
00:06:17,827 --> 00:06:19,530

[laughing]

61
00:06:22,533 --> 00:06:25,002
What kind of
question is that, son?

62
00:06:25,135 --> 00:06:27,104
There's no need
for the attitude.

63
00:06:28,572 --> 00:06:29,806
Cops killed them.

64
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:31,642
A bit more complicated
than that.

65
00:06:31,774 --> 00:06:33,210
It's crystal clear to me.

66
00:06:33,344 --> 00:06:37,314
I think both of you should
get the fuck out of here

67
00:06:37,448 --> 00:06:41,051
before I... I do something
really bad.

68

[officer groans]

00:06:47,824 --> 00:06:49,860

So did I.

- [seagulls squawking]
- Ooh my, this is a bad one.

74
00:07:29,333 --> 00:07:33,504
Hey, Cal, how much did we drink
last night, baby?

75
00:07:35,539 --> 00:07:39,910
You didn't get in no fight,
you didn't make out with nobody.

76
00:07:41,078 --> 00:07:42,812
And we didn't drive.

77
00:07:43,447 --> 00:07:44,581
That's a win.

78
00:07:46,216 --> 00:07:47,418
Ooh.

79
00:07:49,486 --> 00:07:52,556
Oh, this is a bad one, Cal.
[groans]

80
00:07:52,690 --> 00:07:54,591
Oh, come on, man.

81
00:08:04,368 --> 00:08:05,835
Fuck it.

82
00:08:10,140 --> 00:08:12,810
- What's up, Mack?
- [ship horn blows]

83
00:08:12,943 --> 00:08:14,445
Come on, Tanner.

84
00:08:14,578 --> 00:08:16,313
You look like shit.

85
00:08:16,447 --> 00:08:19,249
Said the crackhead
on the front porch.

86
00:08:19,849 --> 00:08:21,285
What the hell you want?

87
00:08:21,418 --> 00:08:24,855
Seeing if I could bump a smoke,
grab a few bucks.

88
00:08:26,123 --> 00:08:27,991
You ever think
of getting cleaned up?

89
00:08:28,125 --> 00:08:30,260
[Tanner] Yeah.
Did you hear the big news?

90
00:08:30,394 --> 00:08:31,762
Nah, what?

91
00:08:31,895 --> 00:08:33,263
The cops,
they arrested the wrong guy,

92
00:08:33,397 --> 00:08:35,666
Kyle Whitlock,
he's innocent, man.

93
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:37,935
And they killed Sean, dude.

94
00:08:38,068 --> 00:08:39,837
Oh, yeah?

95
00:08:39,970 --> 00:08:41,071
How you know that?

96
00:08:41,205 --> 00:08:42,873
I was there.
It's a cover-up.

97
00:08:43,006 --> 00:08:44,742
Right.

98
00:08:44,875 --> 00:08:48,045
And the aliens are
taking over the government.

99
00:08:49,713 --> 00:08:53,183
Man, is it cool if I hang out
here for a few hours?

100
00:08:57,521 --> 00:08:59,022
Thanks, Mack.

101
00:08:59,690 --> 00:09:01,225
You got it, Tanner.

102
00:09:43,667 --> 00:09:45,702

104
00:10:11,195 --> 00:10:14,097
Right, let's keep moving it.
Roll on, roll on.

105
00:10:17,401 --> 00:10:19,169
Oh shit.

106
00:10:21,472 --> 00:10:24,241
Hey, man.
Morning, Mack.

107
00:10:24,876 --> 00:10:26,243
Good to see you, man.

108
00:10:26,376 --> 00:10:28,212
I heard you
tied one on last night.

109
00:10:28,345 --> 00:10:31,348
- Well, good morning to you too, Decks.
- [chuckles]

110
00:10:31,482 --> 00:10:33,016
Hey, you let me
see your badge, man.

111
00:10:33,150 --> 00:10:35,252
- Let's get you in here.
- All right.

112
00:10:36,553 --> 00:10:37,721
There you go.

113
00:10:37,856 --> 00:10:39,423
All right, let me see.

114
00:10:41,291 --> 00:10:43,126
Okay, now... Oh, shit.
Wait a minute.

115
00:10:43,260 --> 00:10:45,930
It says your badge
is expired today, man.

116
00:10:46,063 --> 00:10:47,531
If you're gonna stay on,

117
00:10:47,664 --> 00:10:49,333
you're gonna need to go see
human resources

118
00:10:49,466 --> 00:10:51,468
- and get a new badge.
- Oh, come on, Decks.

119
00:10:51,602 --> 00:10:54,404
Ah, you can handle that, man.
That's how it works.

120
00:10:54,538 --> 00:10:55,639
All right.

121
00:10:56,773 --> 00:10:58,308
Have a good one.

122
00:11:00,444 --> 00:11:02,881
All right, next.
Roll on, roll on.

123
00:11:03,013 --> 00:11:06,083
Come on, let's go.
Here we go.

124
00:11:10,420 --> 00:11:12,322
Good morning, Mack.
You still here?

125
00:11:12,456 --> 00:11:14,424
Oh yeah.
Loving every minute of it.

126
00:11:14,558 --> 00:11:16,426
Damn, girl, you about to pop.

127
00:11:16,560 --> 00:11:19,396
Any minute, I'll tell ya,
just over here, having a ball.

128
00:11:19,530 --> 00:11:22,099
[Mack] I'll bet. Hey, Paula.

129
00:11:22,232 --> 00:11:25,068
You tell your old man for me,
I ain't paying that speeding ticket.

130
00:11:25,202 --> 00:11:26,637
All right, Mack,
I'ma tell him.

131
00:11:26,770 --> 00:11:28,038
No, no, for real.

132
00:11:29,974 --> 00:11:31,208
Asshole.

133
00:11:35,312 --> 00:11:38,917
[chattering]

134
00:11:39,049 --> 00:11:41,351
Oh, come on.

135
00:11:45,222 --> 00:11:46,456
- Well.
- Yeah.

136
00:11:50,561 --> 00:11:52,796
Come on, let's go.
Keep it moving, keep it moving.

137
00:11:52,931 --> 00:11:54,398
This is not your first rodeo.

138
00:11:54,531 --> 00:11:55,632
There we go.

139
00:11:55,766 --> 00:11:58,602
There we... Holy shit.
Look who it is.

140
00:11:58,735 --> 00:12:01,204
M-A-C-K Karr,
Mr. Touchdown.

141
00:12:01,338 --> 00:12:03,140
What up, baby?
You know,

142
00:12:03,273 --> 00:12:05,043
last night,
you were ranting and raving

143
00:12:05,175 --> 00:12:07,177
about how you're about to
light up for the territories.

144
00:12:07,311 --> 00:12:09,279
I know what I said, Blaylock.

145
00:12:09,413 --> 00:12:11,715
I was there, damn it. Just...

146
00:12:11,848 --> 00:12:15,319
- you know, had a change of heart.
- Change of heart?

147
00:12:15,452 --> 00:12:18,655
- Since when? Since last night?
- Oh. Ha-ha!

148
00:12:18,789 --> 00:12:22,726
Come on, let's go, keep it moving.
This ain't your first rodeo, there we go.

149
00:12:26,931 --> 00:12:30,701
I did not think I'd see
your ass in work today.

150
00:12:30,834 --> 00:12:34,338
You were saddled up with me
at the bar last night.

151
00:12:34,471 --> 00:12:36,473
And I only remember
drinking beer.

152
00:12:36,607 --> 00:12:39,643
Oh no, brother,
we went hard after that.

153
00:12:40,544 --> 00:12:42,245
I didn't know any better,

154
00:12:42,379 --> 00:12:44,348
I'd think somebody slipped me
a Mickey.

155
00:12:44,481 --> 00:12:46,450
Why don't you take the day off?
Go home.

156
00:12:46,583 --> 00:12:49,720
Oh come on, Boone.
We're cut from tougher cloth than that.

157
00:12:51,055 --> 00:12:52,756
Rangers lead the way, brother.

158
00:12:52,890 --> 00:12:54,491
All the way, baby.

159
00:13:10,207 --> 00:13:12,142
[phone ringing]

160
00:13:14,378 --> 00:13:17,280

162
00:13:18,782 --> 00:13:20,384
Cranbrook,
how is it looking, man?

163
00:13:20,517 --> 00:13:22,152
<i>Good, really good.</i>

164
00:13:22,285 --> 00:13:24,187
Except one small school bus
coming in.

165
00:13:24,321 --> 00:13:25,722
That's about it.

166
00:13:25,857 --> 00:13:27,992
[Skip] <i>All right,
I got eyes on you, man.</i>

167
00:13:28,126 --> 00:13:30,360
Great. Appreciate you.

168
00:13:33,463 --> 00:13:36,700
[people chattering]

169
00:13:44,909 --> 00:13:46,410
Uh, look at that.

170
00:13:46,543 --> 00:13:48,278
Bummed me
with a pair of twos.

171
00:13:49,513 --> 00:13:51,481
What'd you get, Cranbrook?

172
00:13:57,088 --> 00:13:58,522
Goddamn.

173
00:13:59,523 --> 00:14:01,692
- Howdy, Mack.
- Oh hey.

174
00:14:01,825 --> 00:14:03,560
[Amy]
What they got you on today?

175
00:14:03,694 --> 00:14:06,730
Well, they got me over at
Floodgate 8.

176
00:14:07,464 --> 00:14:09,366
Did you hear back from UGA?

177
00:14:09,499 --> 00:14:13,770
- No. Guess I'm just gonna have to keep welding by day.
- [Sophia] Hey, Amy.

178
00:14:15,073 --> 00:14:16,941
Did you hear back from GT?

179
00:14:17,708 --> 00:14:20,377
- I'll see you around, Mack.
- Yeah.

180
00:14:21,411 --> 00:14:23,181
I don't know why
she does me like that.

181
00:14:23,313 --> 00:14:25,083
Well, GT is Georgia Tech.

182
00:14:25,215 --> 00:14:28,853
So, Amy's hoping for Georgia
Bulldog Graduate School.

183
00:14:28,986 --> 00:14:32,556
I heard you made a scene
last night at the juke joint.

184
00:14:32,689 --> 00:14:33,991
A scene?

185
00:14:34,125 --> 00:14:36,393
Moi? No.

186
00:14:37,061 --> 00:14:38,695
Hollering about leaving.

187
00:14:38,829 --> 00:14:41,431
Mack, you've only
been back for a month.

188
00:14:42,699 --> 00:14:45,302
- Did you get the box I sent?
- Yeah.

189
00:14:45,435 --> 00:14:49,639
I mean, did you have to send
all the pictures, Soph, I mean?

190
00:14:49,773 --> 00:14:51,943
You know, didn't you at least
wanna keep a couple?

191
00:14:52,076 --> 00:14:53,677
I kept one or two.

192
00:14:53,810 --> 00:14:55,812
Just in case you don't come back
from one of those trips

193
00:14:55,947 --> 00:14:58,348
you take with
your old Special Forces buddies?

194
00:14:58,482 --> 00:15:00,617
Well, we all can't be
silver-spoon-up-the-ass,

195
00:15:00,751 --> 00:15:02,586
corporate types like Smith,
now can we?

196
00:15:02,719 --> 00:15:04,654
- Mack, don't start.
- Now I get it.

197
00:15:04,788 --> 00:15:08,391
- So if I had learned just a little bit less than you...
- Okay, stop.

198
00:15:08,525 --> 00:15:09,793
- About running this place...
- Mack, stop.

199
00:15:09,927 --> 00:15:11,361
No, no, and gone head to
head with you

200
00:15:11,495 --> 00:15:12,997
for the position
of plant director,

201
00:15:13,131 --> 00:15:15,032
and beat you out...

202
00:15:15,166 --> 00:15:16,733
then we'd be together.

203
00:15:16,868 --> 00:15:18,368
- Is that what you're telling me?
- No.

204
00:15:18,502 --> 00:15:20,303
If you had just stopped
being a dick,

205
00:15:20,437 --> 00:15:22,006
then we'd be together.

206
00:15:23,941 --> 00:15:27,410
- Oh.
- But we both know that's not gonna happen, now do we?

207
00:15:29,346 --> 00:15:33,050
I'm so much more qualified to run
this place than him and you know it.

208
00:15:33,184 --> 00:15:36,053
You left me, remember?

209
00:15:36,187 --> 00:15:37,855
Is there a problem here?

210
00:15:41,758 --> 00:15:42,894
No.

211
00:15:43,895 --> 00:15:45,362
No, we all good.

212
00:15:49,332 --> 00:15:51,269
Who ate your breakfast,
Cranbrook?

213
00:15:51,401 --> 00:15:52,937
Come on, now.

214
00:16:18,728 --> 00:16:21,999
Have a great day.
See you later.

215
00:16:38,748 --> 00:16:40,985
[students chattering]

216
00:16:41,919 --> 00:16:43,855
Come on, hi.

217
00:16:43,988 --> 00:16:46,324
Okay, welcome
to Fitzgerald Hydroelectric.

218
00:16:46,456 --> 00:16:50,862
Raise your hand if you've
ever been inside a dam?

219
00:16:53,363 --> 00:16:56,366
Okay. Who's ready?
Yeah.

220
00:16:59,237 --> 00:17:02,073
- Hey, you got this, 'cause I got to hit the john?
- Right on time.

221
00:17:02,206 --> 00:17:04,541
Hey, you gotta keep it
regular, right?

222
00:17:49,921 --> 00:17:52,390
Shit.
Base, this is Checkpoint Alpha.

223
00:17:52,522 --> 00:17:54,424
We got anybody else
coming in today?

224
00:17:54,557 --> 00:17:56,826
<i>Hello, Base?</i>

225
00:17:57,460 --> 00:17:58,595
<i>Are you there?</i>

226
00:17:58,728 --> 00:18:00,097
<i>Base, do you copy?</i>

227
00:18:00,231 --> 00:18:02,465
Hello? Hello?

228
00:18:07,704 --> 00:18:09,140
What the hell?

229
00:18:10,573 --> 00:18:14,178
[shouts] Base?

230
00:18:30,660 --> 00:18:33,496
Tried to get you
to join the team, Jared.

231
00:18:46,676 --> 00:18:48,611
Boone's on line.

232
00:18:56,519 --> 00:18:58,055
[guard] Wait, you... Ah!

233
00:18:59,457 --> 00:19:00,790
[gunfire]

234
00:19:04,128 --> 00:19:08,099
- What the hell is going on?
- Call Cranbrook. Tell him to put us on a Level Three alert.

235
00:19:08,232 --> 00:19:11,534
And tell him to call
Homeland Security.

236
00:19:11,668 --> 00:19:14,238
This is Smith,
get me the NSA immediately.

237
00:19:20,244 --> 00:19:24,982
[phone ringing]

238
00:19:26,783 --> 00:19:29,320
Pick up.
Pick up, pick up.

239
00:19:29,453 --> 00:19:31,088
Cranbrook, answer, goddamn it.

240
00:19:32,289 --> 00:19:34,392
Get up! Get your hands up!

241
00:19:34,524 --> 00:19:36,994
Hurry up, move, move!

242
00:19:37,128 --> 00:19:38,996
- Move your ass downstairs!
- Hurry up!

243
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:42,400
[both] Get your hands up!
Get your fucking hands up!

244
00:19:42,532 --> 00:19:43,833
Move, move, move.

245
00:19:43,968 --> 00:19:46,170
Hey, motherfucker,
hands up, hands up!

246
00:19:46,303 --> 00:19:48,671
Hands up.
Downstairs, get downstairs.

247
00:19:48,805 --> 00:19:51,042
[phone ringing]

248
00:19:55,712 --> 00:19:58,715
- Hey Skip. Cranbrook.
- [Skip] <i>Smith was trying to call us, but his line went dead.</i>

249
00:19:58,848 --> 00:20:01,551
- <i>Everything good?</i>
- [Cranbrook] <i>I saw the deactivation, sorry about that.</i>

250
00:20:01,684 --> 00:20:04,188
<i>We had one more school bus trickle
in that we didn't know about.</i>

251
00:20:04,321 --> 00:20:07,757
- [Skip] <i>Weird, hopefully they aren't in the way too much.</i>
- [Cranbrook] <i>Yeah.</i>

252
00:20:07,892 --> 00:20:09,692
[Skip] <i>Well, holler
if you need anything.</i>

253
00:20:09,826 --> 00:20:12,029
[Cranbrook] <i>Yeah,
should be back on now.</i>

254
00:20:12,163 --> 00:20:15,199
All right,
you have a great day.

255
00:20:43,094 --> 00:20:44,727
Holy shit.

256
00:20:44,862 --> 00:20:47,331
Okay, okay, okay,
okay, okay, okay.

257
00:20:57,241 --> 00:20:59,376
Oh no, mm-mmm.

258
00:20:59,510 --> 00:21:01,312
I did not sign up for this shit.

259
00:21:01,445 --> 00:21:04,215
Especially not for no
whack-ass dam, mm-mmm.

260
00:21:05,950 --> 00:21:09,320
- [soldier 1] Let me see your hands!
- [soldier 2] Against the wall!

261
00:21:09,453 --> 00:21:11,055
- [soldier 1] Get your hands up!
- [soldier 2] Against the wall!

262
00:21:11,188 --> 00:21:13,257
[soldier 3] Against the wall,
hands up!

263
00:21:13,390 --> 00:21:16,861
Don't you say a word either.
You just stand there and shut up!

264
00:21:19,629 --> 00:21:23,367
[soldier 4] Let's go, let's go, come on.
Against the wall.

265
00:21:24,401 --> 00:21:27,271
You wanna tell me what
the hell is going on here?

266
00:21:27,404 --> 00:21:30,040
You'll find out
soon enough.

267
00:21:38,415 --> 00:21:40,251
Who's got eyes on Smith?

268
00:21:40,384 --> 00:21:42,453
<i>I wanna talk to him.</i>

269
00:21:42,586 --> 00:21:44,754
<i>I wanna talk to him right now!</i>

270
00:21:46,357 --> 00:21:49,659
Tried to warn you about
that last union contract.

271
00:21:50,861 --> 00:21:52,396
I got him.

272
00:21:56,766 --> 00:21:58,701
It's not personal.

273
00:22:02,506 --> 00:22:05,910
This is Smith,
the police are on the way.

274
00:22:06,043 --> 00:22:09,947
[Ron] <i>Oh Smith,
this is our first disagreement.</i>

275
00:22:11,215 --> 00:22:13,750
A few more and it won't be good.

276
00:22:18,821 --> 00:22:20,624
<i>Show me Paula.</i>

277
00:22:20,757 --> 00:22:22,725
<i>Paula Fulbright.</i>

278
00:22:27,431 --> 00:22:28,599
[Boone] Phone down!

279
00:22:28,731 --> 00:22:30,568
Come on, get out, get out.

280
00:22:30,700 --> 00:22:33,404
[sobbing]

281
00:22:33,537 --> 00:22:35,005
Please, no.

282
00:22:35,139 --> 00:22:38,075
Jesus Christ, Boone,
what the hell are you doing?

283
00:22:38,209 --> 00:22:41,711
She's pregnant
and there are kids here today.

284
00:22:41,844 --> 00:22:43,080
Your point?

285
00:22:43,214 --> 00:22:45,916
You're not as tough
as you think.

286
00:22:49,687 --> 00:22:51,355
Boo!

287
00:22:51,488 --> 00:22:52,856
[chuckles]

288
00:22:52,990 --> 00:22:54,225
Two for flinching.

289
00:22:54,358 --> 00:22:57,661
Hey, come here.
Take this, take this.

290
00:22:57,794 --> 00:22:59,496
You, watch her.

291
00:22:59,630 --> 00:23:01,098
- Get in here.
- Grab her.

292
00:23:01,232 --> 00:23:02,633
Get over there,
against the wall.

293
00:23:02,765 --> 00:23:05,169
Against the wall.
Both of 'em.

294
00:23:07,204 --> 00:23:08,339
[Ron] <i>Round 'em up.</i>

295
00:23:08,472 --> 00:23:10,140
Including the children.

296
00:23:11,141 --> 00:23:13,377
- Move, move, move, move!
- Let's go, move it.

297
00:23:13,510 --> 00:23:15,112
Move. Come on, let's go.

298
00:23:15,246 --> 00:23:17,514
- Hands up.
- Hands up.

299
00:23:17,648 --> 00:23:18,781
Move!

300
00:23:18,916 --> 00:23:20,750
[Boone] Get 'em down here now!

301
00:23:20,884 --> 00:23:22,720
Get 'em down!
Get over here.

302
00:23:22,853 --> 00:23:25,990
- [soldier] Get in there!
- Get these kids over here right now.

303
00:23:26,123 --> 00:23:29,393
Move your ass.
I said, move your ass.

304
00:23:29,526 --> 00:23:31,061
- Hey! Hey!
- Move it!

305
00:23:31,195 --> 00:23:34,932
- How could you do this?
- What happened wasn't right.

306
00:23:35,065 --> 00:23:37,101
- You know that, too.
- Were you there?

307
00:23:37,234 --> 00:23:40,104
Now's not the time
to get smart with me.

308
00:23:40,237 --> 00:23:41,605
Get the fuck out of my face.

309
00:23:41,739 --> 00:23:43,307
Get these kids over there!

310
00:23:43,440 --> 00:23:45,709
- Get over! Move!
- Move right now!

311
00:23:45,842 --> 00:23:47,011
[soldiers shouting]

312
00:23:47,144 --> 00:23:49,046
Get down on your fucking knees!

313
00:23:49,179 --> 00:23:51,048
Get on your knees!

314
00:23:51,848 --> 00:23:53,317
Now you listen to me.

315
00:23:54,184 --> 00:23:56,287
If I see one small move,

316
00:23:56,420 --> 00:24:01,824
we're gonna be sending you home in a
body bag to your mama and your papa.

317
00:24:01,959 --> 00:24:03,394
You hear me?

318
00:24:04,495 --> 00:24:05,696
We are not joking!

319
00:24:05,828 --> 00:24:07,965
[coughing]

320
00:24:10,200 --> 00:24:12,703
Are you okay? He needs help.

321
00:24:12,835 --> 00:24:15,239
Boone, Boone, he needs help.

322
00:24:15,372 --> 00:24:17,441
What do you want me to do, huh?

323
00:24:17,574 --> 00:24:19,910
- I don't...
- [Ron] <i>Bring me Smith.</i>

324
00:24:20,044 --> 00:24:21,078
Roger that.

325
00:24:21,211 --> 00:24:22,746
Are you fucking kidding me?

326
00:24:22,880 --> 00:24:24,448
You got 'em.

327
00:24:24,581 --> 00:24:26,917
[Sophia] It's okay.
We're gonna get you help, okay?

328
00:24:27,051 --> 00:24:29,019
We're gonna figure this out.

329
00:24:29,153 --> 00:24:31,555
Is everyone okay?
We're gonna be okay.

330
00:24:39,029 --> 00:24:41,965
All right, tough guy, you're up.

331
00:24:42,099 --> 00:24:44,501
- Where are you taking me?
- Shut the fuck up.

332
00:24:52,443 --> 00:24:54,244
Hey, get me!

00:25:27,878 --> 00:25:30,247

[Gator on radio]

- Good.

I want a head count.

346
00:26:48,125 --> 00:26:52,196
Make sure my men are here
and accounted for.

347
00:26:53,030 --> 00:26:54,798
Make sure we have a perimeter.

348
00:26:55,666 --> 00:26:58,035
I don't wanna have
any cops here.

349
00:26:59,369 --> 00:27:01,638
- [Boone] Roger that.
- All right.

350
00:27:49,319 --> 00:27:51,154
[soldier 1] Where'd he go?

351
00:27:52,189 --> 00:27:54,024
[soldier 2] Let's check
over here.

352
00:27:54,959 --> 00:27:56,527
[soldier 1] Anybody see?

353
00:27:58,495 --> 00:28:01,431
- [metallic clanking]
- [soldier 2] He's not here.

354
00:28:04,134 --> 00:28:05,636
[soldier 1] Clear up here.

355
00:28:08,272 --> 00:28:09,806
Check the stairway.

356
00:28:09,941 --> 00:28:11,508
[soldier 2] Got it.

357
00:28:18,415 --> 00:28:20,384
Nothing on 'em.

358
00:29:22,245 --> 00:29:24,481
[grunting]

359
00:29:26,316 --> 00:29:27,718
Shut up, shut up.

360
00:29:27,851 --> 00:29:29,620
Shut the fuck up.

361
00:29:38,896 --> 00:29:40,564
Sorry, brother.

362
00:30:06,423 --> 00:30:08,692
Whoa, whoa,
don't shoot, it's me.

363
00:30:08,825 --> 00:30:12,329
Blaylock. What the hell are you
doing in the damn bathroom, man?

364
00:30:12,462 --> 00:30:14,398
I don't know,
I was in here doing my business.

365
00:30:14,531 --> 00:30:16,466
I heard gun shots,
so I popped my head out.

366
00:30:16,600 --> 00:30:18,568
And I'm seeing soldiers
pushing people around.

367
00:30:18,702 --> 00:30:20,604
Some security guard you are.

368
00:30:20,737 --> 00:30:21,873
They got guns.

369
00:30:22,006 --> 00:30:23,074
You got a goddamn gun.

370
00:30:23,206 --> 00:30:24,541
Yeah, but they got better guns.

371
00:30:24,675 --> 00:30:27,111
- Did you call it in?
- [Blaylock] Got no signal.

372
00:30:27,244 --> 00:30:29,646
Shit. They must have jammed it.

373
00:30:29,780 --> 00:30:31,615
I mean, what the hell
do these guys want anyway?

374
00:30:31,748 --> 00:30:33,316
How the hell am I
supposed to know?

375
00:30:33,450 --> 00:30:35,385
Fuck! I didn't sign up
for this shit.

376
00:30:35,519 --> 00:30:38,455
What are we gonna do?
Aren't you like ex-military or something?

377
00:30:39,090 --> 00:30:40,390
And then some.

378
00:30:40,992 --> 00:30:42,392
Come on.

379
00:30:45,595 --> 00:30:48,231
Hey, Cranbrook,
where you at?

380
00:30:49,934 --> 00:30:51,702
Just chilling at Starbucks,
you want something?

381
00:30:51,835 --> 00:30:53,171
<i>Where the fuck
you think I'm at?</i>

382
00:30:53,303 --> 00:30:54,371
Where's the welder?

383
00:30:54,504 --> 00:30:55,706
[Cranbrook] <i>Welder?</i>

384
00:30:55,839 --> 00:30:57,641
Yeah, fucking Mack Karr,
where's he at?

385
00:30:57,774 --> 00:30:59,509
I know what's going on,
you fucked up.

386
00:30:59,643 --> 00:31:01,311
<i>Mack Karr's not supposed
to be here today, idiot.</i>

387
00:31:01,445 --> 00:31:04,448
[Gator] <i>You look at those
fancy screens in front of you?</i>

388
00:31:05,382 --> 00:31:07,818
I ain't seeing shit, Gator.

389
00:31:07,952 --> 00:31:11,923
Fuck, waste of time.
I'm going to the dam. This is useless.

390
00:31:19,362 --> 00:31:21,398
- We got kids here today?
- Yeah.

391
00:31:21,531 --> 00:31:23,300
- How many?
- I don't know, about 20.

392
00:31:23,433 --> 00:31:25,203
Shit. Sophia with them?

393
00:31:25,335 --> 00:31:26,837
I believe so.

394
00:31:27,337 --> 00:31:29,539
[panting]

395
00:31:48,492 --> 00:31:49,793
[Smith] What is it?

396
00:31:50,727 --> 00:31:51,828
Money?

397
00:31:52,864 --> 00:31:55,365
- We can work something out.
- [laughs]

398
00:31:55,499 --> 00:31:58,769
- Listen, my family...
- I know about your family.

399
00:32:00,238 --> 00:32:02,106
I don't want your damn money.

400
00:32:02,240 --> 00:32:04,374
You're an entitled little prick,

401
00:32:04,508 --> 00:32:07,611
like a... an annoying rich kid.

402
00:32:07,744 --> 00:32:09,746
You think soldiers are free?

403
00:32:09,881 --> 00:32:13,117
I got plenty of money.
And I'll spend all of it.

404
00:32:13,251 --> 00:32:15,352
That's who the fuck I am.

405
00:32:16,353 --> 00:32:17,889
All right.

406
00:32:18,022 --> 00:32:21,491
So all this is
about you fighting the system?

407
00:32:21,625 --> 00:32:23,194
That's right.

408
00:32:23,326 --> 00:32:25,462
Something you know
nothing about.

409
00:32:27,198 --> 00:32:28,799
Enter your override code.

410
00:32:30,201 --> 00:32:31,434
[Smith] Excuse me?

411
00:32:31,568 --> 00:32:33,004
You heard what the fuck I said.

412
00:32:34,005 --> 00:32:36,540
Enter your code.

413
00:32:39,843 --> 00:32:42,013
[Smith] And what if I don't?

414
00:32:45,749 --> 00:32:47,919
If you don't enter your code,

415
00:32:48,052 --> 00:32:51,354
I'll make a small gesture
with my finger like this.

416
00:32:51,488 --> 00:32:52,924
And then you'll have
a nice little bullet

417
00:32:53,057 --> 00:32:54,959
rattling around in
your fucking skull.

418
00:32:55,092 --> 00:32:56,827
Get the fuck over there.

419
00:33:02,766 --> 00:33:04,035
Do it.

420
00:33:10,875 --> 00:33:13,543
[beeping]

421
00:33:14,212 --> 00:33:15,512
There's a good boy.

422
00:33:15,645 --> 00:33:19,516
Now, pull up
the floodgate override.

423
00:33:19,649 --> 00:33:22,119
I strongly advise that
we don't do that.

424
00:33:22,253 --> 00:33:23,620
[grunts]

425
00:33:23,753 --> 00:33:27,124
- Open Gate 3.
- [Smith] That will cause flooding.

426
00:33:27,258 --> 00:33:30,862
The water level will raise too much.
Please don't make me do that.

427
00:33:30,995 --> 00:33:33,363
Did it sound like
I was asking you?

428
00:33:33,496 --> 00:33:37,634
Listen. There are 100,000
people that live in this county.

429
00:33:37,767 --> 00:33:40,338
Families, homes, businesses,
they will all get destroyed.

430
00:33:40,470 --> 00:33:42,505
Do you understand
people will die?

431
00:33:42,639 --> 00:33:45,709
Good. This is my legacy.

432
00:33:46,376 --> 00:33:48,445
Your legacy?

433
00:33:49,813 --> 00:33:52,049
- You're a fucking crazy man.
- [Ron] Thank you.

434
00:33:52,183 --> 00:33:56,220
You should try
a little bit of crazy.

435
00:33:56,354 --> 00:33:58,755
I'll flood this whole place.

436
00:33:59,689 --> 00:34:02,360
[grunts, coughs]

437
00:34:02,492 --> 00:34:06,097
See now, I told you,
two for flinching.

438
00:34:06,230 --> 00:34:10,500
Now, open the fucking gate.

439
00:34:20,510 --> 00:34:21,845
[person on phone] <i>Operations.</i>

440
00:34:21,979 --> 00:34:25,749
Yeah, this is Smith, 4-7-6.

441
00:34:28,052 --> 00:34:30,021
Open Gate 3.

442
00:34:52,410 --> 00:34:55,379
I just caused a lot of damage.

443
00:34:55,512 --> 00:34:59,482
That's right.
Your daddy could have billions more...

444
00:35:00,483 --> 00:35:02,053
it still wouldn't help.

445
00:35:03,586 --> 00:35:07,124
I would flood this whole
fucking town.

446
00:35:07,892 --> 00:35:12,997
Everyone would drown,
even me.

447
00:35:14,298 --> 00:35:15,632
You're a sick man.

448
00:35:15,765 --> 00:35:17,868
Yeah, we'll talk
about that later.

449
00:35:18,501 --> 00:35:19,836
Will we?

450
00:35:20,537 --> 00:35:22,505
Oh, I already mentioned that.

451
00:35:25,443 --> 00:35:27,677
Roll the camera.

452
00:35:31,481 --> 00:35:33,884
I want all of 'em to see me.

453
00:35:51,202 --> 00:35:52,269
Here we go.

454
00:35:52,403 --> 00:35:55,772
Live from Bumfuck, Georgia.

455
00:35:57,408 --> 00:35:59,076
<i>All right, everybody.</i>

456
00:36:00,543 --> 00:36:02,179
<i>I hope you're settled in.</i>

457
00:36:04,781 --> 00:36:07,485
<i>If all goes well,</i>

458
00:36:07,617 --> 00:36:10,021
<i>the floodgates will be closed.</i>

459
00:36:11,155 --> 00:36:12,555
However...

460
00:36:13,858 --> 00:36:17,761
if things don't go to my...
my satisfaction,

461
00:36:18,695 --> 00:36:22,532
<i>it's gonna be Hurricane Katrina</i>

462
00:36:23,300 --> 00:36:25,236
all over again.

463
00:36:25,369 --> 00:36:27,204
<i>But this time,</i>

464
00:36:27,338 --> 00:36:30,174
<i>here in South Georgia.</i>

465
00:36:31,808 --> 00:36:33,543
Let's get on with it.

466
00:36:34,378 --> 00:36:35,779
Ms. Fulbright.

467
00:36:35,913 --> 00:36:37,281
Where you at, Cankles?

468
00:36:46,623 --> 00:36:48,959
All right. Let's go, Paula.

469
00:36:50,161 --> 00:36:51,128
No.

470
00:36:53,330 --> 00:36:55,199
No! [sobbing]

471
00:36:55,332 --> 00:36:56,666
Package is en route.

472
00:36:56,800 --> 00:36:58,668
- Outstanding.
- [door opens]

473
00:36:58,802 --> 00:37:03,074
Three of ours are KIA.
Two workers are unaccounted for.

474
00:37:03,207 --> 00:37:05,409
[laughing]

475
00:37:05,543 --> 00:37:08,678
What did you do?
You recruit pussies?

476
00:37:11,781 --> 00:37:15,352
Mack Karr, Army Ranger.

477
00:37:16,586 --> 00:37:18,655
- Is it real?
- Yeah.

478
00:37:21,859 --> 00:37:23,928
Working at a fucking dam?

479
00:37:24,061 --> 00:37:27,697
I'm just now hearing
about this guy?

480
00:37:27,831 --> 00:37:29,632
Why don't you ask
your inside man?

481
00:37:29,766 --> 00:37:30,935
He won't be a problem.

482
00:37:31,068 --> 00:37:33,137
[Ron] He's already a problem.

483
00:37:34,271 --> 00:37:36,673
Yeah, he wasn't in my sector.

484
00:37:36,806 --> 00:37:39,043
- Kiss my Cuban ass.
- Shut up.

485
00:37:40,144 --> 00:37:43,080
Yeah, you sissies wanna
fight in a playground?

486
00:37:43,746 --> 00:37:46,783
Fine, find him.

487
00:37:47,684 --> 00:37:48,618
Right now.

488
00:37:48,751 --> 00:37:50,321
Roger that.

489
00:37:54,325 --> 00:37:55,692
[Gator] Hey.

490
00:37:56,659 --> 00:37:58,162
What's with you
and Mack Karr?

491
00:37:58,295 --> 00:38:00,364
There's nothing with me
and Mack Karr.

492
00:38:00,498 --> 00:38:02,765
What are you guys,
butt buddies or something?

493
00:38:02,900 --> 00:38:07,704
Whatever Ron's paying you,
it's too much.

494
00:38:08,906 --> 00:38:10,307
Fucker.

495
00:38:11,909 --> 00:38:13,978
Do you know who I am?

496
00:38:15,446 --> 00:38:16,947
No?

497
00:38:17,882 --> 00:38:20,017
I don't know you at all.

498
00:38:21,684 --> 00:38:25,256
You're just collateral damage.

499
00:38:27,191 --> 00:38:29,726
Boys, let's get her a phone.

500
00:38:30,928 --> 00:38:32,762
An outside line

501
00:38:32,897 --> 00:38:35,866
and a box of tissues.

502
00:38:37,001 --> 00:38:38,903
She's gonna need it.

503
00:38:45,675 --> 00:38:49,280
[soldier on radio] <i>All available
sentries move to the junkyard, now.</i>

504
00:38:52,416 --> 00:38:54,285
[soldier]
Move, move, move. Move it.

505
00:38:54,418 --> 00:38:56,887
- Come on, let's go.
- Move!

506
00:39:06,597 --> 00:39:10,467
You should have seen my wife
when she was pregnant.

507
00:39:12,069 --> 00:39:14,405
She was nearly bedridden.

508
00:39:16,140 --> 00:39:18,841
No way, she couldn't have
handled this.

509
00:39:21,378 --> 00:39:22,745
Boy or girl?

510
00:39:24,481 --> 00:39:25,916
It's a girl.

511
00:39:26,684 --> 00:39:28,419
Congratulations.

512
00:39:30,955 --> 00:39:32,289
[Mack] Watch the sniper.

513
00:39:38,761 --> 00:39:40,130
Come on, Blaylock!

514
00:39:45,269 --> 00:39:47,371
Come on, Blaylock, take cover.

515
00:39:48,706 --> 00:39:50,040
Where now?

516
00:39:50,174 --> 00:39:52,509
There's a boat,
there's a boat.

517
00:39:59,316 --> 00:40:00,884
[grunting]

518
00:40:07,524 --> 00:40:09,860
Mack! Sniper on the roof!

519
00:40:21,038 --> 00:40:24,975
- Untie the fucking boat!
- Yeah, I'm trying, just give me cover!

520
00:40:45,029 --> 00:40:47,665
[Blaylock] Why don't we go to
the other side and just get help?

521
00:40:47,797 --> 00:40:51,368
[Mack] We leave now,
them kids' chances go from slim to none.

522
00:40:52,636 --> 00:40:57,408
- [coughing]
- Just breathe, just breathe, okay?

523
00:40:59,576 --> 00:41:00,944
What the fuck is this?

524
00:41:01,078 --> 00:41:02,746
What the fuck is this?

525
00:41:02,880 --> 00:41:04,248
What is this, show and tell?

526
00:41:04,381 --> 00:41:05,749
Get the fuck back!

527
00:41:05,883 --> 00:41:08,585
You want me to show you what
a bullet can do to a human body?

528
00:41:08,719 --> 00:41:09,753
Huh?

529
00:41:09,887 --> 00:41:11,789
He's dying, Boone.

530
00:41:11,922 --> 00:41:14,224
We need to call an ambulance.

531
00:41:16,860 --> 00:41:18,595
That can't happen, not yet.

532
00:41:25,636 --> 00:41:27,271
Can I get someone
from the medical team

533
00:41:27,404 --> 00:41:30,074
down to the cafeteria
immediately?

534
00:41:33,811 --> 00:41:35,612
You disgust me.

535
00:41:43,954 --> 00:41:46,190
[both panting]

536
00:41:50,094 --> 00:41:53,497
[soldier on radio] <i>They got off the
dock at the other facility. Move in.</i>

537
00:41:53,630 --> 00:41:55,399
Got it, I'm on it.

538
00:41:56,834 --> 00:41:58,135
You got a name?

539
00:41:59,737 --> 00:42:02,005
Either Lynn or Laura.

540
00:42:02,973 --> 00:42:04,441
Laura.

541
00:42:05,743 --> 00:42:07,244
Oh, that's beautiful.

542
00:42:08,645 --> 00:42:11,949
It was my sister's name,
she passed away.

543
00:42:12,850 --> 00:42:14,551
I'm... I'm very sorry.

544
00:42:15,152 --> 00:42:17,287
Natural causes?

545
00:42:18,622 --> 00:42:20,290
It was a drunk driver.

546
00:42:20,424 --> 00:42:22,559
Hit and run outside Austin.

547
00:42:22,693 --> 00:42:24,261
Shit.

548
00:42:29,199 --> 00:42:30,934
That's terrible.

549
00:42:31,068 --> 00:42:32,669
Did they get the guy?

550
00:42:33,937 --> 00:42:35,205
It was a she.

551
00:42:35,339 --> 00:42:39,109
And yeah, she's up for parole
in five years.

552
00:42:39,910 --> 00:42:42,679
Stings, doesn't it?

553
00:42:44,581 --> 00:42:45,983
Sorry.

554
00:42:58,729 --> 00:43:01,098
I need you to do me a favor.

555
00:43:02,266 --> 00:43:04,201
I need you to call your husband.

556
00:43:07,938 --> 00:43:10,507
You tell him exactly what I say.

557
00:43:12,543 --> 00:43:14,278
[whimpering]

558
00:43:21,718 --> 00:43:23,620
[phone ringing]

559
00:43:25,222 --> 00:43:27,424
- Hey, babe.
- [Paula] <i>Hey.</i>

560
00:43:27,558 --> 00:43:31,028
I need you just to stop
by the dam real quick

561
00:43:31,161 --> 00:43:33,330
- when you get a chance.
- [Fulbright] <i>Yeah?</i>

562
00:43:34,298 --> 00:43:37,869
Um, yeah, yeah,
I guess I can swing there.

563
00:43:38,001 --> 00:43:39,871
<i>Everything all right?</i>

564
00:43:40,003 --> 00:43:42,439
- <i>We've gotten some calls about the water levels rising.</i>
- Yeah.

565
00:43:42,573 --> 00:43:44,708
- <i>Everything's fine.</i>
- All right, sweetie.

566
00:43:44,842 --> 00:43:48,212
- I'll see you soon, okay?
- Okay, see you soon.

567
00:43:55,954 --> 00:43:59,056
Hey, chief. I'm gonna head up to the
dam, take my wife something.

568
00:43:59,189 --> 00:44:02,092
[chief] <i>All right, be careful.
Call you if I need you.</i>

569
00:44:02,226 --> 00:44:03,494
Copy that.

570
00:44:07,164 --> 00:44:08,765
I appreciate that, Paula.

571
00:44:12,169 --> 00:44:15,472
Do you have, uh, a preschool?

572
00:44:18,208 --> 00:44:20,310
Well, you gotta get on that.

573
00:44:21,478 --> 00:44:25,749
All right, gentlemen,
what's the latest on the welder?

574
00:44:31,688 --> 00:44:33,257
Take that ladder.

575
00:44:34,124 --> 00:44:35,526
Come on.

576
00:44:37,528 --> 00:44:40,063
- Come on, man.
- Yeah, man, I'm trying.

577
00:44:45,836 --> 00:44:50,173
[Gator] Mack!
Where are you, you annoying bastard?

578
00:44:52,643 --> 00:44:53,610
Shit.

579
00:45:00,751 --> 00:45:02,452
Fuck that.

580
00:45:04,288 --> 00:45:05,622
[grunting]

581
00:45:05,756 --> 00:45:07,057
Hey, you go up there,

582
00:45:07,190 --> 00:45:08,258
he's gonna pick us up
one by one.

583
00:45:08,392 --> 00:45:10,260
Hey, Mack Karr!

584
00:45:10,394 --> 00:45:12,195
You hear me,
you son of a bitch?

585
00:45:12,897 --> 00:45:14,331
How about you, Tommy Blaylock?

586
00:45:14,464 --> 00:45:16,533
I'm gonna fucking kill you.

587
00:45:21,638 --> 00:45:23,840
[soldier on radio]
<i>Hold your fire. Let's move.</i>

588

[grunting]

589
00:45:33,283 --> 00:45:35,152
Gator, boss wants an update.

590
00:45:35,285 --> 00:45:38,522
He's not my boss,
he's my client.

591
00:45:38,655 --> 00:45:40,290
[sighs]

592
00:45:40,424 --> 00:45:42,159
Do you have eyes on Mack?

593
00:45:43,027 --> 00:45:44,428
He's idle on the plant.

594
00:45:44,561 --> 00:45:46,530
We go up there,
we're sitting ducks.

595
00:45:46,663 --> 00:45:50,300
Then I suggest you find
alternative access, hoss.

596
00:45:51,168 --> 00:45:52,402
That guy.

597
00:46:04,015 --> 00:46:06,583

[Cranbrook] <i>Gator, Fulbright's
approaching the gate.</i>

599
00:46:16,060 --> 00:46:17,862
Don't let the welder move.

600
00:46:19,396 --> 00:46:21,498
I'm gonna take care of the cop.

601
00:46:37,814 --> 00:46:39,349
One cop?

602
00:46:39,483 --> 00:46:41,418
They sent only one cop?

603
00:46:41,551 --> 00:46:43,387
You gotta be shitting me.

604
00:46:43,520 --> 00:46:44,989
And it's Fulbright?

605
00:46:45,123 --> 00:46:47,791
That son of a bitch gave me
a speeding ticket last week.

606
00:46:47,925 --> 00:46:49,626
Bet he's in on it.

607
00:46:49,760 --> 00:46:52,162
[Gator] <i>This is Red Five,
got a present for you Alpha.</i>

608
00:46:52,295 --> 00:46:53,865
What was that?

609
00:46:56,733 --> 00:46:58,235
[Blaylock]
I'm just a security guard.

610
00:46:58,368 --> 00:47:00,671
[Mack] Hey, hey, hey.

611
00:47:00,804 --> 00:47:03,473
- You're not just a security guard, man.
- I'm not?

612
00:47:03,607 --> 00:47:06,110
- No, Blaylock, you're the fucking man.
- I am?

613
00:47:06,243 --> 00:47:09,680
That's right. And that's why you're
gonna take this walkie-talkie

614
00:47:09,813 --> 00:47:12,182
and you're gonna go
and you're gonna get that bus,

615
00:47:12,315 --> 00:47:14,651
and you're gonna take the bus,
and you're gonna go to the front entrance,

616
00:47:14,785 --> 00:47:16,553
and you're gonna get them kids
out of here.

617
00:47:16,687 --> 00:47:18,221
- By myself?
- That's right.

618
00:47:18,355 --> 00:47:20,590
- Why?
- Because I'm the man?

619
00:47:20,724 --> 00:47:22,726
Because you're the fucking man.

620
00:47:22,860 --> 00:47:25,129
And when you get there,
you're gonna go to channel five

621
00:47:25,262 --> 00:47:26,898
and you're gonna
call me till you get me.

622
00:47:27,031 --> 00:47:29,766
- You're the fucking man.
- I'm the man.

623
00:47:31,069 --> 00:47:33,336
I'm the motherfucking man.

624
00:47:37,942 --> 00:47:41,979
- [soldiers shouting]
- Hey, hey, hey, what the hell's going on?

625
00:47:42,779 --> 00:47:44,182
Remember me?

626
00:47:44,314 --> 00:47:45,482
Gator.

627
00:47:45,615 --> 00:47:46,984
Oh!

628
00:47:47,118 --> 00:47:48,652
- Ah, fuck.
- Let's go, buddy.

629
00:47:48,785 --> 00:47:50,587
[Fulbright]
Get off me, get off me.

630
00:47:50,721 --> 00:47:51,521
Gun!

631
00:47:51,655 --> 00:47:53,690
- Get the gun!
- Get the gun!

632
00:47:55,159 --> 00:47:56,526
Take him.

633
00:47:58,528 --> 00:48:00,363
Talk to me, Red Five.

634
00:48:00,497 --> 00:48:02,799
- [Gator] <i>Got Fulbright.</i>
- Outstanding.

635
00:48:02,934 --> 00:48:05,669
Bring his sorry ass here.

636
00:48:06,470 --> 00:48:08,371
The main computer room.

637
00:48:09,173 --> 00:48:10,640
And hurry up.

638
00:48:11,541 --> 00:48:13,710
I got a bone to pick with him.

Um, sorry, kids.

647
00:51:22,666 --> 00:51:25,002
Mack,
you scared the shit out of them.

648
00:51:25,136 --> 00:51:28,438
I'm kind of
winging it here, Soph.

649
00:51:31,775 --> 00:51:34,444
So, got your little fucking
piggy over here.

650
00:51:34,577 --> 00:51:36,247
Come here, sit down.

What is this?

654
00:51:55,132 --> 00:51:58,869
You're a fugitive,
you killed two cops.

655
00:52:02,340 --> 00:52:05,475
Yeah, hard to change it.

656
00:52:05,608 --> 00:52:07,577
We have that in common.

657
00:52:09,612 --> 00:52:11,882
[Fulbright] What the fuck
are you talking about?

658
00:52:14,517 --> 00:52:16,720
You remember my son?

659
00:52:18,822 --> 00:52:20,623
You do, don't you?

660
00:52:23,327 --> 00:52:26,596
You remember Kyle Whitlock?

661
00:52:28,466 --> 00:52:30,101
How about Sean?

662
00:52:30,800 --> 00:52:32,502
You remember him?

663
00:52:35,873 --> 00:52:37,674
It was an accident.

00:52:52,423 --> 00:52:54,225
Oh shit.

00:52:57,395 --> 00:53:00,563
You motherfucker,
you're gonna fucking fry.

[Ron]
You want anymore?

670
00:53:02,433 --> 00:53:04,035
Do you want it?

671
00:53:05,735 --> 00:53:08,838
- Well, get the fuck up.
- [shouts]

672
00:53:17,048 --> 00:53:19,083
- [Fulbright] Fuck you.
- No.

He lied once.

674
00:53:27,024 --> 00:53:28,825
Don't do it again.

675
00:53:30,194 --> 00:53:34,298
Tell me, what really happened
on July 25th?

676
00:53:35,166 --> 00:53:36,566
Tell me!

- Get the fuck down!

680

[Rakestraw]
These are kids.

681
00:54:34,492 --> 00:54:36,026
These aren't our guys.

682
00:54:37,595 --> 00:54:41,132
- Put your fucking hands in the air!
- [gunfire]

683
00:54:43,434 --> 00:54:45,970
- [officer] Hear that?
- [Fulbright] What is that?

684
00:54:51,542 --> 00:54:53,010
It's a fucking duplex.

685
00:54:53,144 --> 00:54:55,146
It's the wrong
fucking place, man.

686
00:54:55,279 --> 00:54:57,548
- [Fulbright] Wrong fucking address.
- Fuck.

687
00:54:58,616 --> 00:55:01,018
All right, come on, come on.
Let's go, let's go.

688
00:55:06,557 --> 00:55:09,659
I want you to say his name.

689
00:55:14,565 --> 00:55:16,033
Say his name!

690
00:55:16,934 --> 00:55:20,770
Kyle. Kyle Whitlock.

691
00:55:20,905 --> 00:55:22,640
That's right.

692
00:55:22,772 --> 00:55:27,912
- Kyle Whitlock.
- He had a... He had a gun.

693
00:55:28,045 --> 00:55:31,081
[Ron] He had a gun
to protect himself.

694
00:55:33,951 --> 00:55:36,854
You fucked everything up.

695
00:55:36,987 --> 00:55:38,355
Everything.

696
00:55:46,463 --> 00:55:48,065
Piece of shit.

697
00:55:49,600 --> 00:55:52,802
[Fulbright] Hey, you listen.
Hey, hey, you listen to me.

698
00:55:53,504 --> 00:55:55,239
You can hurt me.

699
00:55:56,273 --> 00:55:59,210
But if you touch her,
I swear to God,

700
00:56:00,311 --> 00:56:03,013
I will go to my grave
with my thumbs in your eyes.

701
00:56:03,147 --> 00:56:06,083
You're not in a position
to fucking say anything.

702
00:56:09,920 --> 00:56:11,622
Don't... Don't, please.

703
00:56:11,754 --> 00:56:14,258
I got a baby.
I got a baby coming.

704
00:56:15,758 --> 00:56:18,929
Please, I got a little girl.

705
00:56:19,630 --> 00:56:21,265
No.

706
00:56:21,398 --> 00:56:23,500
Change your ways.

707
00:56:26,637 --> 00:56:28,805
You change your fucking ways

708
00:56:28,939 --> 00:56:31,442
or I'm putting the right one
in your head.

709
00:56:35,512 --> 00:56:37,314
Tell me what I want to hear!

710
00:56:39,883 --> 00:56:41,885
Okay, fine.

711
00:56:43,420 --> 00:56:46,957
I'm sorry,
that what you want to hear?

712
00:56:49,260 --> 00:56:52,396
Hey, I can get you a plane,
all right?

713
00:56:52,529 --> 00:56:54,498
I can get you a plane,
I can get you out of here.

714
00:56:54,632 --> 00:56:57,901
I can get you money, I can get you
whatever you need. What do you want?

715
00:56:59,236 --> 00:57:01,071
[laughs]

716
00:57:03,840 --> 00:57:05,775
Is that what it is?

717
00:57:05,909 --> 00:57:07,444
[Fulbright] Sorry.

718
00:57:07,578 --> 00:57:09,513
Yes, I'm sure you are.

719
00:57:11,848 --> 00:57:13,984
Everybody's sorry.

720
00:57:15,986 --> 00:57:17,955
He was a good boy.

721
00:57:19,523 --> 00:57:21,458
And you took him away.

722
00:57:29,533 --> 00:57:31,435
You killed one son.

723
00:57:33,103 --> 00:57:35,472
And you locked the other one up.

724
00:57:39,143 --> 00:57:40,911
- Don't.
- [Paula] No!

725
00:57:41,045 --> 00:57:43,714
[all screaming]

726
00:57:43,846 --> 00:57:45,815
[Paula] <i>No!</i>

727
00:57:47,518 --> 00:57:50,487
[Ron] Move her out of the way.
I'm not done yet.

728
00:57:51,789 --> 00:57:55,959
[groaning]

729
00:58:02,232 --> 00:58:06,904
You... You're a monster!

730
00:58:11,608 --> 00:58:13,444
No!

731
00:58:16,814 --> 00:58:18,115
No!

732
00:58:18,716 --> 00:58:20,250
No!

733
00:58:21,385 --> 00:58:22,852
No!

734
00:58:38,669 --> 00:58:40,738
Feed him to the gators.

735
00:58:40,871 --> 00:58:42,473
[splash]

736
00:58:45,976 --> 00:58:48,011
Rogue hostage?

737
00:58:50,614 --> 00:58:53,984
[Gator] Last I heard he was
cornered at the top of the plant.

738
00:58:55,519 --> 00:58:58,622
Good, good job.

739
00:59:02,159 --> 00:59:04,561
You have to know
he's lost it, right?

740
00:59:05,763 --> 00:59:08,098
I mean, is this going
the way you thought it would?

741
00:59:08,232 --> 00:59:10,200
The way that he said it would?

742
00:59:12,703 --> 00:59:16,173
I think he told you one thing. I think
he told you to come in, guns a-blazing,

743
00:59:16,306 --> 00:59:18,842
get some revenge,
get paid,

744
00:59:18,976 --> 00:59:21,478
but that only the bad people
would get hurt.

745
00:59:23,313 --> 00:59:25,549
Does that sound about right?

746
00:59:26,650 --> 00:59:27,985
Shut up.

747
00:59:29,052 --> 00:59:30,554
It's not going that way, is it?

748
00:59:31,555 --> 00:59:34,258
I said, shut up.

749
00:59:39,530 --> 00:59:43,967
Did you know that
years after Katrina,

750
00:59:44,101 --> 00:59:47,204
there are families that are still
trying to get back on their feet.

751
00:59:47,337 --> 00:59:49,406
I know what it means.

752
00:59:52,009 --> 00:59:53,677
I know what it means.

753
00:59:55,179 --> 00:59:56,947
Oh man.

754
00:59:57,080 --> 00:59:58,982
It's just too dangerous.

755
00:59:59,116 --> 01:00:02,519
Did you just see what I just saw?
This guy's out of his mind.

756
01:00:02,653 --> 01:00:04,621
There's no telling how many
people he's gonna kill.

757
01:00:04,755 --> 01:00:06,590
Moving them is a risk.

758
01:00:06,723 --> 01:00:10,360
Staying here is a risk.

759
01:00:10,494 --> 01:00:13,697
Now, I can get them kids on the
bus and get 'em out of here.

760
01:00:15,032 --> 01:00:16,600
Who's gonna drive the bus?

761
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:43,694
Fuck.

762
01:01:33,544 --> 01:01:35,479
I really need to
use the bathroom.

763
01:01:35,612 --> 01:01:38,148
- Listen, no.
- Hey, hey, hey.

764
01:01:38,782 --> 01:01:40,150
Now go.

765
01:02:05,542 --> 01:02:07,511
Shut up and don't move!

766
01:02:07,644 --> 01:02:10,847
Okay, okay, I'm going,
I'm going, I'm going.

767
01:02:10,982 --> 01:02:12,282
[grunts]

768
01:02:13,250 --> 01:02:15,352
[groaning]

769
01:02:18,121 --> 01:02:19,690
Ah, my nose.

770
01:02:21,993 --> 01:02:23,727
[coughing]

771
01:02:29,833 --> 01:02:31,501
Who's the man?

772
01:02:40,979 --> 01:02:42,512
Yeah, who's the man?

773
01:02:42,646 --> 01:02:44,983
I'm the motherfucking man,
baby.

774
01:02:45,115 --> 01:02:46,850
Y'all good? Everybody okay?

775
01:02:46,985 --> 01:02:49,319
Let's go, come on.
Let's go, let's go, let's go!

776
01:02:49,453 --> 01:02:51,288
Hurry up, get in the bus.
Let's go, let's go!

777
01:02:51,421 --> 01:02:54,424
Come on, let's go.
Go, go, go, go, go, go!

778
01:02:54,558 --> 01:02:56,193
Let's go, here we go.

779
01:02:56,326 --> 01:02:58,261
- Yes!
- Let's go.

780
01:03:20,350 --> 01:03:24,154
All the way to the back. Here we go.
Get on the bus, here we go.

781
01:03:27,824 --> 01:03:29,159
I'll be damned.

782
01:03:30,227 --> 01:03:31,628
Here we go.

783
01:03:32,763 --> 01:03:34,598
[engine starts]

784
01:03:34,731 --> 01:03:36,667
Hey, yo, Mack,
this is Blaylock.

785
01:03:36,800 --> 01:03:39,803
I'm on the move,
heading over there now.

786
01:03:40,404 --> 01:03:43,674
Uh, kids, gentlemen.

787
01:03:43,807 --> 01:03:46,510
What I need you to do is,
I need you to get up.

788
01:03:46,643 --> 01:03:49,212
So I need everyone
to stand up, come on.

789
01:03:52,582 --> 01:03:55,086
[soldier on radio] <i>Boone,
both hostage teams aren't checking in</i>

790
01:03:55,218 --> 01:03:56,921
<i>and Mack can't be found
on the plant.</i>

791
01:03:57,055 --> 01:03:58,923
Shit. Watch him.

792
01:04:16,140 --> 01:04:18,308
It's okay, come on.

793
01:04:31,755 --> 01:04:34,324
Come on, come on, come on.
Come on.

794
01:04:38,762 --> 01:04:39,696
Come on.

795
01:04:39,830 --> 01:04:41,899
Let's go, let's go, come on.

796
01:04:42,033 --> 01:04:43,800
Come on, come on.

797
01:04:48,638 --> 01:04:50,607
Let's go, let's go.

798
01:04:59,616 --> 01:05:02,853
Come on, come on, come on,
come on, get out.

799
01:05:20,403 --> 01:05:22,639
Oh, come on.

800
01:05:24,041 --> 01:05:25,842
Get this over with.

801
01:05:43,094 --> 01:05:44,528
[engine starts]

802
01:05:55,907 --> 01:05:57,407
Oh, fuck.

803
01:06:01,745 --> 01:06:03,647
[Boone]
Stop right there.

804
01:06:04,949 --> 01:06:06,550
You know the drill.

805
01:06:12,023 --> 01:06:13,723
Move.

806
01:06:13,858 --> 01:06:15,059
Move!

807
01:06:23,968 --> 01:06:25,836
[sighs]

808
01:06:27,637 --> 01:06:29,773
Fuck, Mack!

809
01:06:29,907 --> 01:06:31,575
You. You, Boone?

810
01:06:31,708 --> 01:06:33,010
You're a part of all this shit?

811
01:06:33,144 --> 01:06:35,445
You weren't
supposed to be here.

812
01:06:35,579 --> 01:06:36,948
Oh, that's right.

813
01:06:37,081 --> 01:06:38,648
That's right,
the bar last night.

814
01:06:38,782 --> 01:06:40,684
I should have known
something was wrong

815
01:06:40,817 --> 01:06:42,987
the minute you said
you was buying.

816
01:06:44,487 --> 01:06:46,656
Come on, tell me. Why?

817
01:06:46,790 --> 01:06:48,758
They killed
his fucking kid, Mack.

818
01:06:48,893 --> 01:06:51,128
What, they killed his kid,
so you're gonna blow a dam

819
01:06:51,262 --> 01:06:52,662
and kill 100,000 people?

820
01:06:52,796 --> 01:06:54,431
It wasn't supposed to
go down like that!

821
01:06:54,564 --> 01:06:57,134
Well, how the fuck
was it supposed to go down?

822
01:06:57,268 --> 01:06:59,436
You took a fucking oath

823
01:06:59,569 --> 01:07:01,272
to protect this country

824
01:07:01,404 --> 01:07:04,808
against all enemies,
foreign and domestic.

825
01:07:06,610 --> 01:07:08,079
Against who?

826
01:07:09,013 --> 01:07:10,580
People like you.

827
01:07:12,549 --> 01:07:14,651
Oh, brother.

828
01:07:19,489 --> 01:07:21,491
Do the right thing, man.

829
01:07:22,960 --> 01:07:24,694
Not a good look.

830
01:07:45,182 --> 01:07:48,319
No, no, no, Sophia,
you're supposed to be on the bus.

831
01:07:48,451 --> 01:07:50,087
Now what are you doing here?

832
01:07:50,221 --> 01:07:51,755
I ain't gonna leave you.

833
01:07:51,889 --> 01:07:53,556
That was not part of the plan.

834
01:07:53,690 --> 01:07:55,293
And you're supposed to
be with Blaylock.

835
01:07:55,425 --> 01:07:56,559
You're supposed to be safe.

836
01:07:56,693 --> 01:07:59,796
- Okay, so now what?
- I don't know.

837
01:08:01,464 --> 01:08:03,868
I know.
The security hub,

838
01:08:04,001 --> 01:08:07,905
maybe Cranbrook's not with them.
Let's go.

839
01:08:20,184 --> 01:08:23,620
Killing that cop didn't feel
as good as you thought, did it?

840
01:08:26,357 --> 01:08:28,893
We gotta end this, Ron.

841
01:08:29,026 --> 01:08:33,530
We got passports, new names.
We can get the hell out, call this a wash.

842
01:08:36,200 --> 01:08:40,804
That cop looked at me
square in the eyes

843
01:08:41,339 --> 01:08:42,873
and he lied.

844
01:08:44,342 --> 01:08:45,943
[Boone] How do you know that?

845
01:08:48,845 --> 01:08:51,215
[Ron] I thought you were
with us the whole time.

846
01:08:51,349 --> 01:08:53,884
Never figured you
for a fucking psycho.

847
01:08:56,087 --> 01:08:57,321
Come on, man.

848
01:08:57,455 --> 01:08:59,190
And I...

849
01:09:01,758 --> 01:09:06,197
need your strength...

850
01:09:07,098 --> 01:09:09,699
and how you're gonna help me,

851
01:09:09,833 --> 01:09:12,403
and how you're gonna
fucking help me bring along...

852
01:09:12,535 --> 01:09:14,504
- You're going to fucking help, all right?
- Listen...

853
01:09:14,637 --> 01:09:16,407
Listen,
we go a way back, okay?

854
01:09:16,539 --> 01:09:18,442
Yeah, damn straight.

855
01:09:18,575 --> 01:09:21,178
And you know, I'd do anything for you.
Anything in the world.

856
01:09:21,312 --> 01:09:23,914
But I didn't think you'd escalate
this shit to this degree.

857
01:09:24,048 --> 01:09:26,549
I mean, come on, man.
Take the L.

858
01:09:27,985 --> 01:09:29,487
He didn't know they were cops.

859
01:09:29,619 --> 01:09:31,255
[Boone] How do you know that?

860
01:09:32,990 --> 01:09:36,559
What if your son
was the one that lied?

861
01:09:36,693 --> 01:09:40,730
And what if the cops did identify
themselves? And what if he shot first?

862
01:09:40,865 --> 01:09:42,832
He didn't shoot first.

863
01:09:42,967 --> 01:09:44,601
[Boone] How do you know?

864
01:09:44,734 --> 01:09:47,204
'Cause I know my son.

865
01:09:51,142 --> 01:09:54,744
Well, to prove it, it doesn't mean you have
to kill every motherfucker swinging dick

866
01:09:54,879 --> 01:09:56,981
that had something to do
with it, does it?

867
01:10:00,650 --> 01:10:02,153
[Ron] Answer me this.

868
01:10:02,286 --> 01:10:07,224
Did we find who was
related to Larry Rakestraw?

869
01:10:08,825 --> 01:10:10,895
Amy Rakestraw.

870
01:10:13,297 --> 01:10:14,731
Listen, apple pie.

871
01:10:14,865 --> 01:10:17,935
Why? You like 'em feisty
or some bullshit like that?

872
01:10:18,069 --> 01:10:19,937
Yeah, something like that.

873
01:10:33,683 --> 01:10:36,187
- Cranbrook?
- Mack.

874
01:10:37,021 --> 01:10:39,356
Quite a mood this morning,
brother.

875
01:10:39,490 --> 01:10:41,825
Don't tell me you in on
all this shit.

876
01:10:41,959 --> 01:10:44,295
Come on, Mack. You know
me better than that, but...

877
01:10:47,630 --> 01:10:49,567
This town's gone crazy.

878
01:10:49,699 --> 01:10:52,336
I played football in high school
with this guy.

879
01:10:53,938 --> 01:10:55,705
- You okay?
- Yeah.

880
01:10:55,839 --> 01:10:57,908
He always gave me
the heebie-jeebies.

881
01:11:04,348 --> 01:11:07,784
Open another gate, now.

882
01:11:24,168 --> 01:11:27,670
[newscaster] <i>If you're coming out
of Cherokee County, stay at home.</i>

883
01:11:27,804 --> 01:11:33,043
<i>Reports are coming in the hydroelectric
dam is not able to keep the gates working.</i>

884
01:11:38,616 --> 01:11:39,950
Sit.

885
01:11:40,885 --> 01:11:44,054
So I assume you know
why we're here.

886
01:11:46,991 --> 01:11:50,060
And here I was thinking
you had good intel.

887
01:11:52,296 --> 01:11:54,697
Detective Rakestraw.

888
01:11:58,536 --> 01:12:00,171
You're not related to him?

889
01:12:01,438 --> 01:12:05,742
Unfortunately, that feckless
piece of shit is my brother.

890
01:12:06,743 --> 01:12:08,145
Stepbrother.

891
01:12:08,279 --> 01:12:11,582
[Ron] So my intel was spot on.

892
01:12:12,950 --> 01:12:17,054
But if you think that no account son of
a bitch is gonna come running down here

893
01:12:17,188 --> 01:12:18,956
just 'cause I call him,

894
01:12:19,089 --> 01:12:21,892
your intel's for shit, hoss.

895
01:12:22,393 --> 01:12:23,826
Is that right?

896
01:12:24,562 --> 01:12:27,730
He's a low-life, dirty cop.

897
01:12:27,865 --> 01:12:30,267
Shit, he's probably
worse than Fulbright.

898
01:12:30,401 --> 01:12:32,636
Fulbright, he was just roped in
on this whole damn thing.

899
01:12:32,769 --> 01:12:34,371
He's nothing but a follower.

900
01:12:34,505 --> 01:12:37,474
He's just loyal to a fault.

901
01:12:44,781 --> 01:12:46,783
I got that feeling.

902
01:12:48,686 --> 01:12:55,226
Most people in this town think it
was bullshit what happened to Kyle.

903
01:12:56,227 --> 01:13:00,730
Kid, he stayed to himself,
never bothered anyone.

904
01:13:00,864 --> 01:13:04,401
Went to school.
I didn't know him. But...

905
01:13:06,003 --> 01:13:09,839
But he seemed like
a real good kid.

906
01:13:09,974 --> 01:13:15,079
But there are better ways
to get justice than this.

907
01:13:16,447 --> 01:13:18,949
I wish that were true.

908
01:13:20,584 --> 01:13:22,319
I live in the real world.

909
01:13:22,453 --> 01:13:25,456
Which is why you should know
just as good as anybody

910
01:13:25,589 --> 01:13:30,760
that bad, god-awful shit
happens to good people

911
01:13:30,894 --> 01:13:32,663
all the damn time.

912
01:13:32,795 --> 01:13:35,132
But the difference between
you and them

913
01:13:35,266 --> 01:13:37,368
is that you think the answer
to the fact

914
01:13:37,501 --> 01:13:40,037
is to just wash it all away.

915
01:13:45,042 --> 01:13:46,977
I like you, Amy.

916
01:13:52,616 --> 01:13:54,851
I hate to have to kill you.

917
01:13:58,522 --> 01:14:00,324
Call the detective now.

918
01:14:05,529 --> 01:14:06,997
[sniffles]

919
01:14:10,401 --> 01:14:15,406
I bet you a million bucks I ain't
got, this dickhead don't answer.

920
01:14:29,553 --> 01:14:32,056
Did you cut it off
or cut it back on?

921
01:14:32,189 --> 01:14:34,191
[cell phone vibrates]

922
01:14:35,125 --> 01:14:37,561
Well, how long did you
leave it off?

923
01:14:39,797 --> 01:14:41,565
Well, sweetie...

924
01:14:50,274 --> 01:14:54,278
Look, I think we reached the apex to my
knowledge of the subject of your Wi-Fi.

925
01:14:54,411 --> 01:14:56,613
- [horn honking]
- No, I know we have.

926
01:14:56,747 --> 01:15:01,251
I gotta go, I gotta go.
Babe, we'll look at it when I get home.

927
01:15:09,927 --> 01:15:12,930
Well, howdy, officers.
I don't have my driving license,

928
01:15:13,063 --> 01:15:16,066
but I got a bus here of kids
that need some help now.

929
01:15:16,967 --> 01:15:18,869
Jesus Christ.

930
01:15:19,002 --> 01:15:20,270
[Ron] Again.

931
01:15:20,404 --> 01:15:22,005
[sniffles]

932
01:15:29,513 --> 01:15:31,415
[officer]
Get an ambulance for the driver.

933
01:15:31,548 --> 01:15:33,817
- Call these kids' parents.
- Let's go!

934
01:15:33,951 --> 01:15:35,586
Calm down,
we got you, calm down.

935
01:15:35,719 --> 01:15:39,123
Calm down? I just told you
there's a bus full of kids.

936
01:15:39,256 --> 01:15:41,091
I'm pretty sure I know
why you're calling.

937
01:15:41,225 --> 01:15:43,360
[Blaylock]
<i>Do you have the phone?</i>

938
01:15:43,494 --> 01:15:45,696
Yeah,
and you need to come alone.

939
01:15:45,829 --> 01:15:49,299
[Blaylock] <i>Amy, hey, Amy.
Hang up the the phone 'cause we need help!</i>

940
01:15:52,936 --> 01:15:54,371
He's on his way.

941
01:15:56,607 --> 01:15:58,275
Outstanding.

942
01:16:10,120 --> 01:16:11,555
[Gator] Mack Karr!

943
01:16:12,423 --> 01:16:14,291
Drop the gun.

944
01:16:20,964 --> 01:16:22,566
You must be Gator.

945
01:16:23,333 --> 01:16:25,402
Yeah, I bet
you're a big Florida fan.

946
01:16:25,536 --> 01:16:27,638
No. Bulldogs.

947
01:16:27,771 --> 01:16:30,040
No shit, me too.

948
01:16:30,174 --> 01:16:33,243
Yeah, I've been
waiting for this.

949
01:16:35,012 --> 01:16:37,414
[grunting]

950
01:16:50,060 --> 01:16:54,131
[grunting]

951
01:17:07,544 --> 01:17:11,648
[groaning]
I'm gonna get you Mack Karr.

952
01:17:29,199 --> 01:17:32,135
[karate grunts on video]

953
01:17:48,719 --> 01:17:50,220
[phone ringing]

954
01:17:51,722 --> 01:17:53,657
[Skip] <i>NSA Security,
this is Skip.</i>

955
01:17:53,790 --> 01:17:58,997
- Skip, Officer Bledsoe, Fitzgerald Chief of Police.
- Okay.

956
01:17:59,129 --> 01:18:03,567
We met at that mixer thing at the Civic Center,
where you all walked us through the...

957
01:18:03,700 --> 01:18:09,206
Oh yeah, it wasn't really a mixer. It was
more of a safety protocol seminar, but...

958
01:18:09,339 --> 01:18:13,610
Yeah, well I just want to let you know that
your safety protocols are for shit, hoss.

959
01:18:14,879 --> 01:18:16,113
Excuse me?

960
01:18:16,246 --> 01:18:17,814
[Bledsoe] <i>Copy that.</i>

961
01:18:26,690 --> 01:18:28,125
Hey.

962
01:18:29,359 --> 01:18:31,029
Easy there, Eastwood.

963
01:18:31,161 --> 01:18:33,965
- Did you get him?
- No.

964
01:18:34,097 --> 01:18:37,902
Bunch of assholes out there
trying to interfere with me.

965
01:18:38,036 --> 01:18:40,337
Check it out.

966
01:18:40,470 --> 01:18:45,910
Rakestraw. What the hell is going on?
Why are these cops showing up one by one?

967
01:18:46,044 --> 01:18:47,778
First Fulbright, now him.

968
01:18:47,912 --> 01:18:49,948
I'm sure Blaylock drove
straight to the police station.

969
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,017
Right, right,
so if the police know...

970
01:18:53,150 --> 01:18:55,586
- NSA knows.
- So where the hell are they?

971
01:18:56,587 --> 01:18:58,655
They sure are taking their
sweet-ass time getting here.

972
01:18:58,789 --> 01:19:02,860
I gotta figure out a way to get in
that control room and stop this fool.

973
01:19:05,562 --> 01:19:07,899
- I'll be back.
- I'm coming with you.

974
01:19:08,498 --> 01:19:09,968
Oh no, you're not.

975
01:19:10,100 --> 01:19:13,370
Mack, I can help you
shut the dam down.

976
01:19:13,503 --> 01:19:15,772
Sophia, no, you are not.

977
01:19:18,042 --> 01:19:19,643
[laughs]

978
01:19:24,916 --> 01:19:27,684
You're a detective now?

979
01:19:31,588 --> 01:19:36,693
Your sister confirmed
what I already know.

980
01:19:36,827 --> 01:19:38,528
I bet she did.

981
01:19:40,031 --> 01:19:41,632
We're in agreement.

982
01:19:43,800 --> 01:19:49,773
You are the sorriest sack of
shit in the whole damn county.

983
01:19:49,907 --> 01:19:52,944
- [chuckles]
- You wouldn't have the whole truth

984
01:19:53,077 --> 01:19:54,845
if it bit you on the ass.

985
01:19:56,213 --> 01:19:58,749
Let's just say I beg to differ.

986
01:20:00,283 --> 01:20:02,120
Sorry to keep everybody waiting.

987
01:20:02,252 --> 01:20:06,189
Ron Whitlock, former head of
security, Fitzgerald Hydroelectric.

988
01:20:06,323 --> 01:20:08,458
And from what I can tell,
there's a rogue hostage with

989
01:20:08,592 --> 01:20:12,663
some sort of military background
who has helped us to free the kids.

990
01:20:12,796 --> 01:20:15,933
Or else the whole dam
might already be under water.

991
01:20:16,067 --> 01:20:20,704
It is my high recommendation we make
this a full-scale military operation.

992
01:20:20,837 --> 01:20:24,307
We get in, secure the facility,
and get out.

993
01:20:24,441 --> 01:20:26,576
Is that understood?

994
01:20:26,710 --> 01:20:28,679
- Then let's make this happen.
- [helicopter whirring]

995
01:20:52,335 --> 01:20:53,670
[grunts]

996
01:20:54,438 --> 01:20:57,307
[Amy gasping]

997
01:20:59,877 --> 01:21:01,411
[groans]

998
01:21:15,993 --> 01:21:19,463
I'm a cop.
Don't fucking shoot me.

999
01:21:19,596 --> 01:21:22,232
They're gonna
fucking kill you, man.

1000
01:21:25,036 --> 01:21:26,436
[soldier] Where are they?

1001
01:21:26,570 --> 01:21:28,638
Get to the manual overdrive.

1002
01:21:29,439 --> 01:21:31,374
Go, go, go.

1003
01:21:44,088 --> 01:21:46,623
[Mack] Let me guess, Gator.

1004
01:21:46,757 --> 01:21:50,660
You mama name you that
or come up with it on your own?

1005
01:21:50,794 --> 01:21:53,697
Well, why don't you
come out here and find out?

1006
01:21:54,698 --> 01:21:56,666
[Mack] I'm out of ammo.

1007
01:21:58,335 --> 01:22:00,303
Mano a mano.

1008
01:22:01,404 --> 01:22:03,640
Hand to hand, man to man?

1009
01:22:04,307 --> 01:22:05,943
You got it.

1010
01:22:14,451 --> 01:22:15,819
Motherfucker.

1011
01:22:22,325 --> 01:22:25,796
Sorry, dude,
got a town to save.

1012
01:22:35,305 --> 01:22:36,941
I'm hearing chatter.

1013
01:22:38,075 --> 01:22:40,077
What kind of chatter?

1014
01:22:40,211 --> 01:22:42,880
My guess is the NSA's been mobilized.
We gotta go.

1015
01:22:43,014 --> 01:22:44,848
Like hell.

1016
01:22:45,782 --> 01:22:48,186
Listen, man, we tried,
this is over.

1017
01:22:48,318 --> 01:22:49,921
We... We can't.

1018
01:22:50,687 --> 01:22:52,756
You don't fucking do anything

1019
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:55,358
unless I'm fucking talking
about that.

1020
01:22:55,492 --> 01:22:58,095
Do you understand that?
I'm calling the shots.

1021
01:22:58,229 --> 01:23:00,898
Me, that's it, that's it.

1022
01:23:01,032 --> 01:23:03,767
I don't wanna have
any problems from you.

1023
01:23:06,037 --> 01:23:08,940
Let's just wash
the whole thing away.

1024
01:23:09,073 --> 01:23:12,109
Smith, open another gate.

1025
01:23:13,376 --> 01:23:15,779
Hey! Now!

1026
01:23:42,739 --> 01:23:44,774
Think about what you're doing.

1027
01:23:44,909 --> 01:23:47,345
I mean, do you even care
that you are gonna

1028
01:23:47,510 --> 01:23:49,446
completely destroy
an entire county?

1029
01:23:49,579 --> 01:23:51,481
Just shut up.

1030
01:23:52,849 --> 01:23:54,952
This is not gonna
end well for you.

1031
01:23:55,086 --> 01:23:58,788
You don't give a shit
about anybody but yourself.

1032
01:23:59,957 --> 01:24:01,758
[laughs]

1033
01:24:08,099 --> 01:24:09,867
That is beautiful.

1034
01:24:12,069 --> 01:24:15,639
You just want to see this
whole place wash away, right?

1035
01:24:17,041 --> 01:24:19,944
We're all gonna drown, Jesus!

1036
01:24:22,113 --> 01:24:24,581
Boone, we gotta go.

1037
01:24:25,482 --> 01:24:27,285
We can't leave these people.

1038
01:24:27,817 --> 01:24:30,121
We can and we will.

1039
01:24:31,956 --> 01:24:35,725
- You gotta close the gate.
- I can't let that happen.

1040
01:24:35,860 --> 01:24:37,895
Close the fucking gate!

1041
01:24:38,029 --> 01:24:44,135
I only wanted one cop
to admit that they fucked up.

1042
01:24:46,370 --> 01:24:48,172
And they can't do it.

1043
01:24:49,907 --> 01:24:52,676
They'd rather
destroy their town

1044
01:24:52,809 --> 01:24:55,046
than clear my son's name.

1045
01:24:56,546 --> 01:24:59,350
Well, now you've killed
them all, so it's on you.

1046
01:24:59,482 --> 01:25:02,452
I'll bear that burden.

1047
01:25:04,521 --> 01:25:06,723
It's what makes me different.

1048
01:25:10,061 --> 01:25:11,628
[gunshot]

1049
01:25:12,696 --> 01:25:14,231
I'll own it!

1050
01:25:21,838 --> 01:25:23,673
Get him out of here.

1051
01:25:36,486 --> 01:25:39,723
[grunting]

1052
01:26:03,914 --> 01:26:07,817
Now... Now y'all pissing me off.

1053
01:26:10,553 --> 01:26:13,757
Oh, man, I hate this thing.

1054
01:26:37,281 --> 01:26:39,016
Team, deploy.

1055
01:26:42,719 --> 01:26:44,088
Move, move, move!

1056
01:26:44,221 --> 01:26:47,124
Deploy west, B Team.
Move, move!

1057
01:26:48,526 --> 01:26:50,261
Go, go!

1058
01:26:57,201 --> 01:27:00,737
Move to side entrance,
go, go.

1059
01:27:07,111 --> 01:27:11,148
It's over, Ron.
You make a move, slim, the boss gets it.

1060
01:27:12,849 --> 01:27:15,785
- The rogue hostage?
- [Mack] That's me.

1061
01:27:15,920 --> 01:27:19,957
Rogue hostage, rogue welder,
rogue just about everything.

1062
01:27:21,025 --> 01:27:24,028
- You look it.
- Thanks.

1063
01:27:24,161 --> 01:27:27,231
I read your file, I served also.

1064
01:27:27,364 --> 01:27:31,368
Yeah, no shit. Kind of figured
that part out on my own, man.

1065
01:27:32,203 --> 01:27:34,305
I thought all this
meant something.

1066
01:27:41,278 --> 01:27:42,313
Move your ass!

1067
01:27:50,720 --> 01:27:52,957
You'll kill everybody, you know.

1068
01:27:59,662 --> 01:28:01,932
Even if you can control
the flood.

1069
01:28:02,732 --> 01:28:04,368
Yeah, I know.

1070
01:28:05,735 --> 01:28:07,670
I read your story, man.

1071
01:28:07,804 --> 01:28:09,440
I know what's got you
all riled up.

1072
01:28:09,573 --> 01:28:12,910
- Don't start with the bullshit.
- [Mack] No, no, no, I'm not.

1073
01:28:13,043 --> 01:28:17,948
A friend of mine was there that day who
saw what really happened with your son.

1074
01:28:20,885 --> 01:28:23,020
<i>He says he's innocent, man.</i>

1075
01:28:24,088 --> 01:28:25,489
Bullshit.

1076
01:28:25,623 --> 01:28:28,859
I swear it, soldier to soldier.

1077
01:28:31,462 --> 01:28:32,997
Come on, man.

1078
01:28:33,130 --> 01:28:35,466
Fucking come on, Ron.
Call 'em off, man.

1079
01:28:35,599 --> 01:28:37,767
Where is this guy
you were talking about?

1080
01:28:37,902 --> 01:28:39,136
[Mack] I know where
to find him.

1081
01:28:39,270 --> 01:28:42,973
And I promise you,
if you call off your men,

1082
01:28:43,107 --> 01:28:46,243
I will make sure that
his story gets out there.

1083
01:28:46,743 --> 01:28:48,845
[laughs]

1084
01:28:48,979 --> 01:28:51,182
I heard that before too.

1085
01:28:51,781 --> 01:28:53,816
Fuck!

1086
01:28:56,320 --> 01:28:58,055
Come on, come on.

1087
01:28:59,623 --> 01:29:00,925
Come on.

1088
01:29:01,824 --> 01:29:03,127
Fuck. Fuck!

1089
01:29:03,260 --> 01:29:06,063
You need to close them
fucking gates right now.

1090
01:29:06,696 --> 01:29:08,232
[Ron] Gates stay open.

1091
01:29:08,365 --> 01:29:11,834
Tell that bitch to stop trying
or Smith will be next.

1092
01:29:12,835 --> 01:29:14,771
Shit.

1093
01:29:16,974 --> 01:29:19,742
[ringing]

1094
01:29:21,278 --> 01:29:25,583
Sophia, listen to me, do not close
the gates. They are going to kill me.

1095
01:29:25,715 --> 01:29:29,286
Take your hands off the wheel,
do you understand?

1096
01:29:29,420 --> 01:29:30,820
Are you serious?

1097
01:29:30,955 --> 01:29:33,157
They're gonna flood
the entire county.

1098
01:29:33,290 --> 01:29:35,993
<i>No, we have to close the gates.</i>

1099
01:29:36,527 --> 01:29:38,095
<i>Are you serious?</i>

1100
01:29:38,229 --> 01:29:39,762
Asshole!

1101
01:29:39,897 --> 01:29:41,498
Ugh!

1102
01:29:57,381 --> 01:30:00,850
[NSA soldier] Hands up,
the power's being shut down.

1103
01:30:04,521 --> 01:30:06,823
Close the fucking gates!

1104
01:30:08,192 --> 01:30:10,760
- Put your guns down!
- [shouting]

1105
01:30:10,894 --> 01:30:11,996
Don't shoot!

1106
01:30:12,129 --> 01:30:13,931
Surrender, surrender.

1107
01:30:14,064 --> 01:30:15,933
No, don't shoot.
Don't shoot, Ron.

1108
01:30:16,066 --> 01:30:17,868
Tell your men to
put the gun down.

1109
01:30:18,002 --> 01:30:19,403
Come on, man.

1110
01:30:20,104 --> 01:30:23,073
Ron. This is no way to go out.

1111
01:30:24,108 --> 01:30:26,243
Come on, man, put the gun down.

1112
01:30:26,377 --> 01:30:28,946
Put the gun down, it's over.

1113
01:30:30,214 --> 01:30:34,885
Come on, man.
This is no way to go out.

1114
01:30:35,852 --> 01:30:37,054
It's over.

1115
01:30:37,187 --> 01:30:40,991
Just make sure that
my son gets out.

1116
01:30:43,727 --> 01:30:46,563
Soldier to soldier, okay?

1117
01:31:29,707 --> 01:31:31,909
[newscaster] <i>As Fitzgerald

Man, shut up, Blaylock.

- My man.
- No, no, no, the man.

- That's right, baby.
- That's what I'm talking about.

Wow, that's nice.
